00:04.326 --> 00:07.089
So, Eric, your dad's
muffler shop opens tomorrow.

00:07.141 --> 00:11.479
That's, like, the perfect job for him.
I mean, he's been muffling you for years.

00:12.125 --> 00:14.397
Yes, he really hates noise.

00:14.474 --> 00:17.439
I think it's because
it reminds him of fun.

00:17.736 --> 00:21.076
Hey, at least Red got a job he likes.
I thought I was cool flipping burgers,

00:21.157 --> 00:26.576
then I met the night shift guy who's been doing it for 30
years. He's got no eyebrows, and he lives in his own car.

00:27.806 --> 00:29.789
I don't want to be that guy.

00:29.939 --> 00:33.306
And you won't be if you
follow the plan I gave you,

00:33.356 --> 00:35.772
Okay? We get a job
as a local weather team,

00:35.822 --> 00:38.089
then go national as
morning talk show hosts,

00:38.122 --> 00:41.756
and then... star in
our own ice capades.

00:42.872 --> 00:46.059
Jackie, I've told you,
I don't capade.

00:46.609 --> 00:48.959
- I am quitting my job, though.
- Me too.

00:49.009 --> 00:52.709
The department of motor vehicles
is not as glamorous as it sounds.

00:53.892 --> 00:55.792
You know what
motor vehicles are?

00:56.059 --> 00:57.576
They're cars.

01:00.126 --> 01:02.381
Just cars.

01:04.048 --> 01:07.681
Fez, you know what you should do?
You should be a cop like me.

01:07.731 --> 01:10.398
You could go undercover
and catch foreigners.

01:15.315 --> 01:17.881
Oh, so it's a crime
to be foreign, huh?

01:18.648 --> 01:20.265
No, of course not.

01:20.298 --> 01:23.348
It's a crime to do the
things that foreigners do.

01:23.881 --> 01:27.615
Well, I, for one, love my
job. Want to know why?

01:27.665 --> 01:29.432
I have no job.

01:29.515 --> 01:32.132
Yeah, that's one of the
benefits of taking the year off.

01:32.198 --> 01:35.532
Speaking of that, how'd that all-day
marathon go on the slip 'n slide?

01:35.865 --> 01:37.515
Pretty good.

01:37.998 --> 01:40.615
Except for around
hour three, when...

01:40.815 --> 01:42.882
I got a pretty
serious owie.

01:43.265 --> 01:47.182
Yeah, when you went in for a juice,
I slipped a rock under there.

01:48.198 --> 01:51.931
Ah. Anyway, today, I
will be chasing butterflies.

01:52.665 --> 01:56.015
Tomorrow, I'm gonna break
out the giant bubble wand.

01:56.581 --> 01:59.931
What'd you do, go down the
clearance aisle at the drugstore?

02:00.548 --> 02:02.098
Yes, I did.

02:02.614 --> 02:06.764
You'll all be happy to know you'll be receiving
goody bags containing 4th of July socks,

02:06.797 --> 02:08.146
cornstarch

02:08.197 --> 02:10.564
and a calendar
from 1972.

02:15.659 --> 02:18.509
Okay, I think we're nearly
set up for business.

02:18.542 --> 02:20.742
Thanks for helping,
or, uh,

02:20.775 --> 02:23.992
standing around saying,
"ew, grease."

02:24.142 --> 02:26.225
Whoa, Steven.

02:26.292 --> 02:27.975
You already got
that muffler together?

02:28.009 --> 02:31.309
Yeah, well, you know, metal
shop was my favorite class.

02:31.492 --> 02:32.725
I went to, like,

02:32.759 --> 02:34.342
half of 'em.

02:36.292 --> 02:39.542
You know, I need an extra set of hands
around here. How'd you like the job?

02:39.592 --> 02:41.259
No, Steven, you can't.

02:41.292 --> 02:46.625
I mean, don't take this personally, Mr. Forman, but
guys who work in muffler shops are bottom-feeders.

02:46.858 --> 02:47.892
Jackie.

02:47.942 --> 02:51.692
Well, I said, "don't take this
personally." What else can I do?

02:52.458 --> 02:54.892
Jackie, I gotta take
this job. You kidding me?

02:54.925 --> 02:57.725
I mean, I'm good with
my hands, I don't mind dirt,

02:57.775 --> 03:00.425
and I have a high
tolerance for fumes.

03:01.508 --> 03:04.108
Fine. If it makes you
happy, then I'm happy.

03:04.158 --> 03:08.591
Steven, why is it everything that I
love about you also grosses me out?

03:08.975 --> 03:10.775
You're so complicated.

03:10.925 --> 03:13.508
Okay. You can
start tomorrow.

03:13.708 --> 03:16.691
But we're not driving in
together. That's too weird.

03:17.441 --> 03:18.541
Cool.

03:19.051 --> 03:21.235
All right, I gotta take off. I'm gonna
go have lunch with my new dad.

03:21.285 --> 03:23.418
Oh, bring a camera
get a picture.

03:23.468 --> 03:25.835
Steven, you don't have
any family pictures.

03:25.918 --> 03:29.468
Well, we have some really good ones
of my mom down at the county jail.

03:30.901 --> 03:34.484
One full face, two profiles--
each one dated and numbered.

03:34.918 --> 03:37.751
Oh, Steven, you've
had the hardest life.

03:37.968 --> 03:40.785
You know, I should probably be more
generous and considerate with you.

03:40.835 --> 03:42.635
But I am
what I am.

03:43.951 --> 03:49.042
Okay, we are going to make this
the prettiest muffler shop ever.

03:50.626 --> 03:53.326
Really, all I wanted was
a "grand opening" sign.

03:53.376 --> 03:55.742
And you've got one...

03:56.576 --> 03:58.742
in needlepoint.

04:02.063 --> 04:03.813
Kitty that's so tiny.

04:03.847 --> 04:05.947
Needlepoint is
very hard work.

04:05.997 --> 04:08.213
You never appreciate
anything I do.

04:08.247 --> 04:10.647
You should've just
married Betty Parker.

04:12.047 --> 04:14.963
No, no, no. What I meant
was, it's so tiny, like...

04:15.213 --> 04:16.762
your waist.

04:17.163 --> 04:19.096
Thank you.

04:20.346 --> 04:22.230
Eric, you want to
hand me that manifold?

04:22.297 --> 04:24.063
The manifold.

04:31.563 --> 04:34.780
Mani... fold.

04:36.463 --> 04:40.263
Man, I folded that.

04:40.930 --> 04:43.448
Eric, are you ready
to help me decorate?

04:43.497 --> 04:48.013
Yes, now I was thinking we could line this
counter here with red-white-and-blue bunting.

04:48.813 --> 04:54.121
How is it that I raised a son who
knows "bunting" but not "manifold"?

04:55.588 --> 04:59.071
Well, maybe the problem is
that you were never around.

04:59.521 --> 05:01.921
I was always around.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.354
Yeah, maybe I
was the problem.

05:43.483 --> 05:45.333
I've never been
to a beauty salon.

05:45.367 --> 05:48.300
I'm excited to see how
they make people beautiful

05:49.100 --> 05:52.046
Especially that lady over there.
That's gonna take some work.

05:53.930 --> 05:57.213
Well, Fez, I don't know how long
I'm gonna be here, so no wandering off.

05:57.280 --> 06:00.180
You gave me a hell of a scare
the other day at the mall.

06:00.230 --> 06:04.580
I'm not going anywhere. I'm just
enjoying my time away from the DMV.

06:05.430 --> 06:07.496
All those foreigners...

06:08.330 --> 06:10.963
Learn to speak
garbled english, people.

06:11.630 --> 06:14.147
Well, the last time I was here,
they were looking for help.

06:14.380 --> 06:16.730
And they have no idea
how weird you are.

06:17.797 --> 06:19.835
That is an
advantage.

06:21.068 --> 06:22.385
What's the job?

06:22.435 --> 06:23.651
Shampoo boy.

06:24.435 --> 06:26.135
Shampoo boy?

06:28.168 --> 06:30.868
You mean, I would get
paid for touch hair?

06:32.568 --> 06:35.385
I used to get in so
much trouble for that

06:39.595 --> 06:40.845
Hey!

06:47.328 --> 06:49.161
Don't touch me!

06:58.419 --> 07:00.186
What are you doing, man?

07:00.769 --> 07:05.219
What am I doing? What are you doing with
your long, beautiful hair, you hippie freak?

07:10.351 --> 07:11.784
That's it!

07:12.201 --> 07:15.251
It is my destiny to
be a shampoo boy.

07:16.251 --> 07:19.566
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Is
there a job that pays you to eat pie

07:20.266 --> 07:21.549
No.

07:21.682 --> 07:24.182
It is my destiny to
be a shampoo boy.

07:26.349 --> 07:28.649
Hey, mom, guess what
Hyde just told me.

07:28.699 --> 07:31.182
if it's tawdry, I don't
want to hear it.

07:32.732 --> 07:33.649
No.

07:33.749 --> 07:36.249
Dad offered him a job
at the muffler shop.

07:36.299 --> 07:41.532
And did I even get an offer? No. Like I wasn't there,
too. Like I wasn't all sore from hanging all that bunting.

07:42.699 --> 07:44.738
Well, sweetie, don't
take it so hard.

07:44.772 --> 07:49.922
Your father's always had a soft spot for
Steven, but he loves you, too. I just know it.

07:50.772 --> 07:52.205
Well, you know
what I think?

07:52.238 --> 07:55.255
If dad loves Hyde so much,
maybe he should marry him.

07:55.305 --> 07:59.138
Honey, that's not possible. Your
father is already married to me.

07:59.188 --> 08:01.988
What? No, mom, it's--
it's an expression.

08:02.288 --> 08:04.496
Well, it's nota very good one.

08:05.263 --> 08:08.613
"Twenty three skeedow"
now, that's an expression.

08:09.579 --> 08:10.979
Yes...

08:12.946 --> 08:15.163
That's what I should to say.

08:17.779 --> 08:19.196
Kitty, look

08:19.446 --> 08:22.246
I framed one of my
"grand opening" flyers

08:22.563 --> 08:25.394
now if the shop's a
success, I'll have a souvenir.

08:25.444 --> 08:26.561
And if not,

08:26.611 --> 08:29.394
I'll have something to
glare at while I'm drinking

08:31.294 --> 08:32.811
that's a very good idea.

08:32.844 --> 08:35.294
And you know what else
is a very good idea?

08:35.376 --> 08:38.294
Offering Eric a job just
like you did Steven.

08:38.311 --> 08:41.094
Kitty, I can only afford
to hire one person.

08:41.126 --> 08:43.684
And why can't that one person
be your very own son?

08:43.735 --> 08:46.951
Because my very own son
can't do anything.

08:47.001 --> 08:49.068
No that's not true.

08:49.418 --> 08:53.635
Just today he caught the
most beautiful butterfly

08:54.700 --> 08:55.733
Well

08:55.833 --> 08:59.300
if a giant butterfly is
tearing up the shop

08:59.566 --> 09:01.216
I'll call Eric.

09:01.766 --> 09:05.227
I'm not sure I want him
to face a giant butterfly.

09:13.527 --> 09:16.294
So, Red, we got your
muffler store flyer, and

09:16.360 --> 09:19.260
I'm a little hurt. You know,
you never asked for my input.

09:19.327 --> 09:21.894
I mean, I had a
business on my own.

09:22.077 --> 09:23.093
Bob,

09:23.293 --> 09:25.360
Your business
went under.

09:25.993 --> 09:28.146
Yeah, but
very slowly.

09:28.446 --> 09:30.163
Don't feel
insulted, Bob

09:30.213 --> 09:32.680
Red wouldn't even give
his own child a job.

09:32.746 --> 09:35.930
If you have muffler shop,
wouldn't you give Donna a job?

09:36.080 --> 09:39.047
Sure, Donna knows her
way around the car.

09:39.830 --> 09:44.547
But Eric thinks an exhaust belt is something
that holds up your pants when you're tired.

09:44.947 --> 09:48.085
There's no such thing as
an exhaust belt, Bob.

09:48.852 --> 09:51.635
Well, then he thinks something
else is something else.

09:52.668 --> 09:54.818
Y'know, when you start
a new business,..

09:54.985 --> 09:56.168
You need a gimmick.

09:56.251 --> 09:57.718
When I opened my store,

09:57.768 --> 09:59.285
I rented a monkey.

09:59.918 --> 10:04.135
People will drive a hundred miles to
see a monkey, 200 if he's wearing a suit.

10:04.601 --> 10:08.817
And Bobby dressed up as Tarzan,
and I dressed up as Jane

10:08.867 --> 10:09.950
Remember?

10:10.000 --> 10:11.350
Do I!

10:11.800 --> 10:14.417
"Me, Tarzan, you, Jane.

10:14.584 --> 10:16.837
That's just what I said.

10:17.621 --> 10:20.304
Bob, I'll tell you what my
gimmick is gonna be.

10:20.437 --> 10:22.987
Good service at a fair price.

10:23.021 --> 10:26.132
Oh, please. Leave that
stuff to the Japanese.

10:28.449 --> 10:29.865
Hey Gery.

10:30.299 --> 10:34.332
This is Fez. And he would like to
apply for the shampoo boy job.

10:34.399 --> 10:36.892
Yeah? Why do you
wanna be a shampoo boy

10:36.926 --> 10:42.776
because I love hair--on the head, on the body, on
floor, and if there's one in my salad, I enjoy it more.

10:43.709 --> 10:44.676
Fez.

10:44.726 --> 10:47.076
Okay, maybe I got a
little carried away.

10:47.126 --> 10:49.643
The one on my salad--
I can take it or leave it.

10:50.126 --> 10:51.976
You're a little creepy.

10:52.476 --> 10:55.670
But you're cute, so I'll test you
on one of our regular clients.

10:55.703 --> 10:58.836
Yes, that's great, Fez. I
have complete faith in you.

10:58.870 --> 11:01.553
- You're gonna wash Donna's hair.
- Oh!

11:02.103 --> 11:03.386
Um,

11:03.436 --> 11:06.420
You know, I'm kind of
exclusive with paulette.

11:06.604 --> 11:10.470
I can't just test him on
anyone. He seems kinda pervy.

11:12.104 --> 11:14.004
She gets me.

11:15.320 --> 11:16.787
Okay, fine.

11:16.853 --> 11:21.120
But nothing other than your hands
touches nothing other than my head.

11:21.453 --> 11:23.520
Oh, thank you, Donna.
You're not gonna regret this.

11:23.570 --> 11:26.670
That's the first time I said
that to a girl and meant it.

11:30.653 --> 11:32.551
Well, thanks for lunch, man.

11:32.701 --> 11:37.284
I gotta say, a burger just tastes better when
it's bought for you by your new black dad.

11:39.001 --> 11:40.667
So you must really
love Led Zeppelin.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.884
That's the oldest shirt I've ever seen
on someone who wasn't a bum.

11:44.084 --> 11:44.951
Hey,

11:45.001 --> 11:48.668
If god didn't want me to wear it so much,
he wouldn't have made them rock so hard.

11:49.284 --> 11:52.929
Led Zeppelin's cool. I caught 'em
back in '69. Front row.

11:52.979 --> 11:53.929
Whoa.

11:53.962 --> 11:56.062
Oh, I did well with
the ladies that night.

11:56.129 --> 11:58.429
They probably thought
I was Jimi Hendrix.

11:59.096 --> 12:01.062
I told 'em
I was Jimi Hendrix.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.170
Smile!

12:03.208 --> 12:04.524
Jackie,

12:04.624 --> 12:06.408
we're trying to have
lunch here, do you mind?

12:06.474 --> 12:08.408
Who cares about lunch, Steven?

12:08.458 --> 12:11.741
We need a picture of a
parent who's not under arrest.

12:13.759 --> 12:14.559
Listen,

12:14.609 --> 12:18.159
the reason I wanted to see you is I was thinking
that maybe you'd like to come work for me.

12:18.276 --> 12:20.393
I could teach you the
record store business.

12:20.626 --> 12:22.959
Well, I have stolen
a lot of records.

12:23.876 --> 12:26.526
I would like to learn
why people pay for 'em.

12:27.476 --> 12:28.743
You know what?

12:29.143 --> 12:30.960
I can't. I just took
another job today.

12:31.010 --> 12:32.293
Well, quit that job.

12:32.343 --> 12:36.043
You come work for me, and we'll
kick butt at the father/son picnic.

12:36.143 --> 12:39.477
I'll even start a father/son picnic
just so we can kick butt.

12:40.027 --> 12:42.377
Man, that sounds really cool.
You know, I'll try and work it out.

12:42.427 --> 12:44.610
That's what I like to hear.

12:45.410 --> 12:46.260
Hey!

12:46.310 --> 12:49.477
Well, Steven, you're gonna need
a picture for your Christmas card.

12:59.282 --> 13:01.790
So, uh, Hyde, when my
dad offered you the job,

13:01.840 --> 13:04.989
I mean, what exactly did
he say? Was it, like, um,

13:05.172 --> 13:10.156
"since I don't see my own son here right now,
I might as well just give you the job?"

13:11.872 --> 13:14.568
I can't believe I got a job
from my dad and from Red.

13:14.634 --> 13:16.351
Now I have two jobs.

13:16.701 --> 13:18.584
It's like I'm a workaholic.

13:20.834 --> 13:24.051
I gotta tell you, that's not
the kind of "holic" I thought I'd be.

13:24.884 --> 13:27.603
Wow, Hyde, this is really gettin'
to you. I mean, look at you

13:27.670 --> 13:32.037
you're leaning forward, you got your
sunglasses off. You're freakin' out.

13:33.037 --> 13:35.837
Well, this is an emotional
time for my Steven.

13:35.904 --> 13:40.187
His new daddy and his substitute daddy
are in a tug-of-war for his heart.

13:40.254 --> 13:43.737
Whoa. I thought we established
that Hyde doesn't have a heart.

13:43.970 --> 13:46.870
It was no heart, no brain,

13:46.987 --> 13:48.487
no courage.

13:51.203 --> 13:53.677
I'll just have to tell Red
I can't take the job.

13:53.727 --> 13:55.560
I mean,
he'll understand.

13:55.927 --> 13:58.177
Wait, I'm the scarecrow?

13:59.960 --> 14:02.693
He's the one
who gets set on fire.

14:03.027 --> 14:04.643
Oh, yeah, that's me.

14:06.868 --> 14:10.985
Steven, I have a
little surprise for you.

14:12.968 --> 14:14.801
Pretty nice, huh?

14:15.051 --> 14:17.951
They already had a bunch of
patches that said "Steven."

14:18.001 --> 14:21.885
But I had a "Hyde" one custom-made
'cause I know that's what you prefer.

14:21.951 --> 14:23.985
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

14:24.035 --> 14:25.768
Custom-made?

14:26.018 --> 14:30.018
He once got me a hat that said "Erin"
because it was "close enough."

14:32.772 --> 14:33.889
Uh,

14:33.947 --> 14:36.197
thanks, Red.
This is- this is really cool.

14:36.447 --> 14:37.864
Yeah, well,

14:38.230 --> 14:40.264
you can buy
your own pants.

14:43.810 --> 14:44.943
Hyde...

14:44.976 --> 14:49.626
- Why didn't you say anything?
- Because he's torn between two daddies.

14:51.734 --> 14:54.798
Steven, when you're in a
moral quandary, do what I do,

14:54.848 --> 14:58.664
Okay? Put on some Donny Osmond, close
your eyes and ask yourself one question...

14:58.714 --> 15:00.231
who's richer?

15:02.931 --> 15:05.431
Okay, Fez, this
is your station.

15:05.648 --> 15:08.798
Donna, here's my pepper
spray, just in case.

15:10.498 --> 15:11.631
You owe me.

15:11.864 --> 15:15.014
Okay, let's see what we
have to work with here.

15:32.781 --> 15:34.033
Fez!

15:34.749 --> 15:37.533
Shouldn't you be doing
something with soap and water?

15:37.716 --> 15:40.449
Oh, so you want
it wet and soapy.

15:42.616 --> 15:44.460
Fez, I just want
my hair washed.

15:44.510 --> 15:46.677
Oh, so you want
to call the shots.

15:47.127 --> 15:49.927
- Don't do the "so you want" stuff.
- Oh, so you want it silent.

15:49.977 --> 15:50.727
Fez!

15:51.710 --> 15:53.093
Okay, okay.

15:53.193 --> 15:54.793
Showtime.

15:55.577 --> 15:58.560
Now you're about to
experience some feelings.

15:58.860 --> 16:00.377
My advice is

16:00.610 --> 16:02.327
give into them.

16:08.093 --> 16:10.761
Hey, come on
in. Look around.

16:10.811 --> 16:13.278
Heck, take a muffler if you like.

16:13.361 --> 16:15.094
I'm--I'm just kidding.

16:15.194 --> 16:17.794
Don't touch anything
you're not gonna buy.

16:18.730 --> 16:20.030
W.B.

16:20.089 --> 16:21.506
Surprised to see you here.

16:21.539 --> 16:27.989
Well, I just wanted to see why Steven would take
 a job at a muffler shop instead of working for mein 
an office with air conditioning and a pension plan.

16:28.031 --> 16:30.348
I guess white folks
are just weird.

16:33.782 --> 16:36.332
Man, he didn't even think about
offering me the job, did he?

16:36.382 --> 16:40.082
Oh, well, honey, he just
didn't think you were a good fit.

16:40.448 --> 16:44.075
It's called "Forman & son."

16:48.658 --> 16:52.242
It doesn't say
whose son.

16:56.109 --> 16:57.792
What the hell
are you doing?

16:57.942 --> 16:58.842
What?

16:58.892 --> 17:01.692
It's your first day on the
job, and you're drinking?

17:02.142 --> 17:04.724
This is not summer
camp, you know?

17:04.825 --> 17:06.991
There's drinking
at summer camp?

17:08.075 --> 17:13.724
Look, if you're not responsible enough to handle
yourself, then obviously, I made a big mistake.

17:13.775 --> 17:17.448
I hope there's another job out
there for you, because you're fired.

17:18.164 --> 17:20.448
My dad told you he offered
me a job, didn't he?

17:20.498 --> 17:21.548
What?

17:22.114 --> 17:23.181
No.

17:23.248 --> 17:24.415
What?

17:26.848 --> 17:28.931
'Cause I've heard you
fire a lot of people,

17:28.998 --> 17:32.748
and I've never heard you say, "I hope
there's another job out there for you."

17:33.215 --> 17:37.065
You say, "I hope my foot
doesn't get stuck in your ass."

17:37.431 --> 17:40.881
Or, "don't let my foot get stuck in
your ass on the way out the door."

17:41.048 --> 17:44.464
Or the classic, "I'm gonna
stick my foot in your ass."

17:44.514 --> 17:46.597
Just get outta here.

17:47.714 --> 17:48.947
Thanks, Red.

17:53.881 --> 17:56.399
You're such a softy.

17:57.866 --> 18:00.649
Are you lurking
behind everything?

18:02.533 --> 18:06.025
Well, it's the only way I get
to see your real emotions

18:07.275 --> 18:11.208
So guess you have a job
to offer Eric after all?

18:12.275 --> 18:15.875
Yeah, well, I guess I could
teach Eric something about cars.

18:16.497 --> 18:20.980
Maybe if I told him they were called
"space mobiles," he'd take to it.

18:22.497 --> 18:23.897
Hey, Eric.

18:25.030 --> 18:26.563
How'd you like
to work for me?

18:26.797 --> 18:28.530
Here? With you?

18:29.163 --> 18:33.097
Wow, dad, that would mean a lot.
Then it really would be "Forman & son."

18:33.163 --> 18:35.496
- So you'll take the job?
- Hell, no.

18:39.063 --> 18:40.096
Good.

18:40.130 --> 18:43.191
I mean, I don't want to
work. This is my year off.

18:43.257 --> 18:47.007
Then why did you complain all day
about not getting the job?

18:47.057 --> 18:48.391
Oh, well, mom,

18:48.441 --> 18:52.391
I just wanted to get invited to the
dance. I mean, I didn't want to dance.

18:52.691 --> 18:55.274
Hell, I don't even know
any of the steps.

18:55.324 --> 18:59.224
Honey, you are
a wonderful dancer.

19:05.599 --> 19:06.999
Hey, man,

19:07.065 --> 19:10.132
Is that job still available?
'Cause Red just fired me.

19:10.582 --> 19:12.132
Sure. The job's yours.

19:12.182 --> 19:13.615
Cool. When
do I start?

19:13.665 --> 19:14.565
How about monday?

19:14.599 --> 19:17.049
Ooh, mondays are
gonna be tough for me.

19:17.632 --> 19:20.832
I find I'm fresher if I start
my work week on a tuesday.

19:20.882 --> 19:23.715
Say, uh, some
time after lunch?

19:23.949 --> 19:25.715
I'll see you
monday at 9.

19:25.749 --> 19:27.649
Let's call it 10.

19:28.866 --> 19:30.332
Jackie, Jackie,

19:30.932 --> 19:33.166
Fez shampooed
my hair.

19:33.532 --> 19:36.566
And you were able to untie
yourself and get away?

19:36.899 --> 19:38.199
No, Jackie,

19:38.249 --> 19:39.749
his hands
were amazing.

19:39.782 --> 19:42.999
At one point, it was like
he had five extra fingers.

19:43.049 --> 19:46.449
Well, Donna, he is
foreign. He might.

19:49.672 --> 19:50.955
Ladies.

19:52.339 --> 19:54.172
Hi, Fez.

19:55.305 --> 19:58.521
Well, it's official.
I am shampoo boy.

19:59.288 --> 20:04.038
The word on the street is you need to smoke
a cigarette after this boy lathers you up.

20:04.638 --> 20:06.738
I'm the one
who said that.

20:07.571 --> 20:09.698
Fez, did you get taller?

20:10.398 --> 20:14.831
Well, I'm gonna make an appointment. But I'm
not using the same sink as the old ladies.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.598
Oh, you'll use the
sink I tell you to use.

20:19.481 --> 20:21.304
Okay, Fez.

20:21.987 --> 20:23.237
Wow!

20:25.470 --> 20:28.720
Hey, Red. This
is goin' great.

20:28.770 --> 20:30.787
Ah, yeah.
It's going okay.

20:30.835 --> 20:36.235
But can you imagine how great it would be going if he
used the midget catering company I told him about?

20:36.802 --> 20:37.985
Yeah, well,

20:38.035 --> 20:41.602
uh, thanks, Bob, for not forcing some
cock a mamy gimmick down my throat.

20:41.718 --> 20:43.835
Hey, I'd never do that.

20:43.885 --> 20:46.802
Kelso, plan's off.
Get it outta here.

20:52.363 --> 20:54.446
We got him for
three more hours.

20:54.496 --> 20:57.213
I'm gonna see if I can
teach him how to drive.

21:06.652 --> 21:09.835
There's a butterfly in
the backyard. I'm on it!

21:20.151 --> 21:22.017
Okay. He's after me.

21:22.084 --> 21:24.001
He's after me.

21:26.801 --> 21:29.439
Crap. That just made him mad.
