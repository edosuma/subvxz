DAY ONE

05:24.293 --> 05:25.772
Hello, good day.

05:27.663 --> 05:28.869
My name is Birger.

05:36.138 --> 05:37.583
Should I throw this away or...?

05:42.445 --> 05:44.686
- Nothing at all?
- But, Dad...

05:44.780 --> 05:48.193
But isn't it weird that he hasn't
learned a single word of Swedish?

05:50.052 --> 05:52.862
You have lived together
for a year now.

05:52.955 --> 05:54.696
But, Dad, we've been living
in the U.S.

05:54.790 --> 05:56.895
You don't speak Swedish there,
you know.

05:56.992 --> 05:58.665
No, no.

06:51.947 --> 06:53.187
Hi, Mom!

07:18.007 --> 07:19.315
Let's go!

07:19.408 --> 07:21.012
He's nothing like I expected.

07:42.631 --> 07:44.941
He's shorter than I expected,
isn't he?

07:45.034 --> 07:47.708
I don't know how tall
you expected him to be, so...

07:47.803 --> 07:50.784
He's of normal height.

07:50.873 --> 07:52.318
Normal? No way.

07:52.408 --> 07:56.720
Compared with children
or Asian people maybe.

08:02.585 --> 08:05.498
I can't help comparing all men
with your dad, who's so tall.

08:05.588 --> 08:07.033
Yes...

08:07.122 --> 08:12.663
You have to admit that a tall,
handsome man is irresistible.

10:21.123 --> 10:22.761
Here you go, ladies.

10:22.858 --> 10:24.804
Oh, aren't you sweet?

10:24.893 --> 10:26.895
Thanks, Dad!

10:32.735 --> 10:35.443
Bruce seems like a decent guy.

10:35.537 --> 10:38.040
Yes, he really is.

10:38.140 --> 10:40.484
So, how did you two meet?

10:40.576 --> 10:44.718
We met at a super-romantic
restaurant in New York,

10:44.813 --> 10:49.728
with a view of all Manhattan.

10:55.724 --> 10:58.728
I saw him standing
on the other side of the terrace.

10:58.827 --> 11:00.807
Was he standing on a chair?

11:00.896 --> 11:02.000
No, Mom, he didn't.

11:05.401 --> 11:08.007
Our eyes met,
and he gave me the look,

11:08.103 --> 11:09.741
and I was like...

11:11.440 --> 11:13.010
Then we started talking about art,

11:13.108 --> 11:15.452
and it turns out
he really loves Jackson Pollock.

11:18.781 --> 11:20.590
The rest of the night was magical.

11:23.252 --> 11:25.095
I'll never forget it.

11:25.187 --> 11:26.427
Cheers!

11:28.624 --> 11:31.230
That story almost sounds
too good to be true.

11:31.326 --> 11:33.272
But it isn't.

15:26.561 --> 15:27.767
That's not even the same.

16:50.512 --> 16:52.321
Time to hit the sauna!

17:46.968 --> 17:50.415
Honey, I'm just saying
it's a huge responsibility

17:50.505 --> 17:54.578
to drag a man across the Atlantic
and have him uproot his life.

17:54.676 --> 17:55.882
You just don't do that.

17:55.977 --> 17:58.116
Things are different
with Bruce, okay?

17:59.681 --> 18:01.217
Thanks.

18:03.885 --> 18:05.364
You know what?

18:05.454 --> 18:07.957
We'll put them down here
so that Bruce can reach them.

18:12.961 --> 18:15.965
Now he can reach them, too.

18:18.166 --> 18:24.344
Emma, I do this for a living, all day.
It's my profession...

18:36.384 --> 18:38.728
It's that your professional opinion
as a therapist?

18:38.820 --> 18:45.260
It's my personal, professional opinion
as a therapist and a mother.

18:45.360 --> 18:47.601
Mom, everything is going to work out.

18:47.696 --> 18:50.734
He's different,
but I'm different when I'm with him.

18:50.832 --> 18:52.038
I love Bruce.

19:46.087 --> 19:50.126
Things will be great.
Wait, what's going on?

19:56.831 --> 19:58.174
Here she comes.

19:58.266 --> 20:00.303
- What's going on?
- Right! What's going on?

20:00.402 --> 20:02.109
Right! What's going on?

20:02.203 --> 20:03.807
- Must have been the heat?
- Yes.

20:05.907 --> 20:07.716
He can't hold his liquor.

20:07.809 --> 20:08.913
What is wrong with you?

20:09.010 --> 20:10.614
He has been up for over 24 hours,

20:10.712 --> 20:12.658
and you ply him with liquor
in the sauna!

20:15.250 --> 20:16.752
And why is he wearing swim shorts?

20:16.851 --> 20:19.991
That's what we'd like to know!

20:20.088 --> 20:21.624
Yes.
