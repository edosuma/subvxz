WEBVTT

00:01.640 --> 00:05.890
for the first time since I can remember,which,to
be fair,is only,like,two years now,

00:06.030 --> 00:09.650
I have a job I love--
giving mon to charities.

00:09.770 --> 00:13.970
But there's only so much money,so giving
to one charity means turning down another

00:14.100 --> 00:15.940
-
- meaning someone always gets hurt.

00:17.020 --> 00:17.840
Damn it!

00:17.960 --> 00:18.510
You all right?

00:18.630 --> 00:19.690
Yes.

00:20.280 --> 00:22.790
It hurts so much to say
no to so many people.

00:22.930 --> 00:25.200
Especially when there's so
much to say yes to right here.

00:25.340 --> 00:27.300
Hey,you know what?I'm
kind of busy right n

00:27.460 --> 00:31.210
I'm trying to establish a relationship with the
senate finance committee that oversees nonprofits.

00:31.330 --> 00:32.960
I think you deserve a glass of wine.

00:33.080 --> 00:36.320
I mean,look at me.I have the
senate switchboard on my speed dial.

00:36.440 --> 00:38.300
There are hookers who
don't even have that.

00:38.500 --> 00:39.700
I got this at auction.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.190
It's a 1986 chateau latoque chamonelle.

00:42.320 --> 00:44.660
You're wasting it.I have one
more call,and then I have a date.

00:44.760 --> 00:45.400
Come on.

00:45.550 --> 00:46.520
It's after 10:00 P.M.

00:46.650 --> 00:47.790
It's technically not a date.

00:47.910 --> 00:48.690
It's not 10:00.

00:48.820 --> 00:50.410
It's only--oh,my
god!Oh,my god!

00:50.530 --> 00:51.830
Todd's gonna kill me!

00:51.960 --> 00:53.690
Why didn't he call?

00:53.920 --> 00:55.110
14 missed calls.

00:55.380 --> 00:57.360
After the sixth one,he
should have called the cops.

00:57.500 --> 00:58.830
You're back together with that todd?

00:58.970 --> 00:59.630
No,no,no.

00:59.770 --> 01:02.790
It's just a first date--
well,since we broke up...

01:02.930 --> 01:03.580
the second time.

01:03.770 --> 01:06.340
So I guess it's a first first
de after the second breakup.

01:06.410 --> 01:07.840
I-I gotta go.

01:07.980 --> 01:11.220
Um,you realize this is
a $4,000 bottle of wine?

01:11.350 --> 01:13.030
I mean,that is-- that is
just-- really?Thank you!

01:13.150 --> 01:15.060
That'll smooth things over,huh?

01:17.430 --> 01:18.420
Todd?

01:19.330 --> 01:21.230
oh,todd,I am so,so sorry.

01:21.360 --> 01:23.190
I-I completely lost track of time.

01:23.340 --> 01:24.450
I got caught up in work.

01:24.580 --> 01:26.060
Then why do you have
wine on your breath?

01:26.190 --> 01:27.480
Oh,no.I don't have wine on my breath.

01:27.590 --> 01:28.730
I have wine on my coat.

01:28.860 --> 01:31.260
Yeah,the cab driver kept
stopping really fast.

01:31.390 --> 01:33.520
His backseat is now worth $4,000.

01:33.650 --> 01:36.330
Okay,well,um,I'm trying
to watch this,so...

01:36.450 --> 01:37.880
oh,come on.Please don't be mad.

01:38.010 --> 01:39.180
Look,I really want to go out with you.

01:40.180 --> 01:42.110
Just give me another chance,all right?

01:42.480 --> 01:43.860
I'll let you suck my coat.

01:44.020 --> 01:46.090
Really,really,I'm not mad.

01:46.210 --> 01:47.510
at--at the fourth
call,I was mad.

01:47.620 --> 01:52.130
By the tenth,I remembered how
awful it was being with you before.

01:52.440 --> 01:57.350
Okay,I'm not a student of human emotions,but
that kind of sounds like someone who's mad.

01:57.460 --> 02:00.240
No.No,I'm glad it happened now
before I got all involved again.

02:00.350 --> 02:04.150
It's like,you know,I-I love
kiwis,but they give me a rash.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.070
And if i don't eat them for
a while,i forget I'm allergic.

02:06.190 --> 02:07.750
Then I take a bite,and
there it is again.

02:07.890 --> 02:11.220
So thank you for the rash.

02:12.270 --> 02:16.390
you know what?I think that you are
overreactin to an isolated incident,and...

02:20.090 --> 02:20.840
Where were you?

02:20.980 --> 02:22.320
I called you,like,14 times.

02:22.430 --> 02:24.150
Oh,I had a crazy day at work.

02:24.280 --> 02:25.000
What are you doing home?

02:25.120 --> 02:26.130
I thought you were going to a concert.

02:26.260 --> 02:30.040
No,we were supposeto go to a concert
for your birthday,which is today.

02:30.250 --> 02:31.650
I should have listened
to your whole message.

02:31.810 --> 02:33.060
Well,come on,let's go.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.650
Sam,it's after midnight.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.910
Then it's no longer my birthdaY.

02:37.070 --> 02:38.710
I should celebrate that.

02:39.180 --> 02:40.810
You can come if you want to.

02:40.950 --> 02:42.260
No?All right.

02:42.860 --> 02:44.970
Yes,I screwed up.

02:45.110 --> 02:48.030
But now I have this job that's--
that's really important to me,

02:48.160 --> 02:53.850
and I just need to learn how to balance that
with equally important things to me in my life.

02:53.990 --> 02:55.920
If you were a charity,they'd dovetail.

02:56.050 --> 02:56.840
But you're not.

02:56.970 --> 02:58.340
You're doing really well.

02:58.470 --> 02:59.730
Thank you for making up the couch todaY.

02:59.850 --> 03:00.990
Fine,fine.

03:01.130 --> 03:02.100
One more chance.

03:02.220 --> 03:03.160
Thank you.

03:03.270 --> 03:04.110
Tomorrow night?

03:04.230 --> 03:05.640
I can'T.I can do wednesday.

03:05.770 --> 03:08.540
I can'T.I have a dinner that I've
already cancelled three times.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.940
Otherwise I would be
there with bells on.

03:11.640 --> 03:12.880
"Belzon.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.420
" That sounds like an alien.

03:14.750 --> 03:16.350
"here.I'm here with belzon.

03:16.500 --> 03:17.580
Don't be afraid.

03:17.730 --> 03:20.750
Belzon only eats glass."

03:21.130 --> 03:22.960
Well,you can't say we didn't try.

03:23.080 --> 03:24.150
all right.

03:24.350 --> 03:24.980
All right.

03:25.110 --> 03:26.260
I will cancel.

03:26.730 --> 03:29.250
That village hasn't
had water for a year.

03:29.380 --> 03:31.440
What's one more day,right?

03:32.310 --> 03:33.450
All right.

03:38.170 --> 03:39.150
You're dating todd again?

03:39.280 --> 03:40.520
I'm so excited for you.

03:40.660 --> 03:41.970
Well,we're not dating yet.

03:42.100 --> 03:43.280
We're just going on a date.

03:43.420 --> 03:48.560
But if it goes well,you know,it could
lead to another and another and another.

03:48.680 --> 03:49.880
I can see us riding horses.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.020
No!

03:51.200 --> 03:53.290
Why are you going to
go down this path again?

03:53.420 --> 03:57.820
Especially when you have this
handsome,rich man who wants you?

03:57.960 --> 04:01.930
You can marry him,and we could be in
the bajillionaire wives club together.

04:02.060 --> 04:04.280
Ooh,I was the president
of the astronomy club.

04:04.440 --> 04:10.030
Yeah,oh,word of advice-- get your dues early,or
you will end up with a very expensive telescope.

04:10.160 --> 04:11.010
Yeah.

04:11.290 --> 04:14.350
Anyway,I'm not going
down that path again,okay?

04:14.480 --> 04:17.959
Todd and I are at very different places in our--
can you please get that camera out of my face?

04:18.100 --> 04:20.010
Yeah,enough about you anyway.

04:20.339 --> 04:23.350
It's my episode of "superstar weddings.

04:23.710 --> 04:26.450
" I can't believe I'm on my favorite sh

04:26.580 --> 04:29.350
I mean,these are the same people
that do "superstar divorces.

04:29.500 --> 04:35.390
" In fact,I even have my quote ready
for that show if--if need be,god forbid.

04:36.460 --> 04:39.190
you're so funny.My funny friends.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.750
But you know what's not a joke?

04:40.910 --> 04:45.250
The great taste of bauman's
original hard lemonade.

04:46.590 --> 04:48.040
Sam,what is your mom doing here?

04:48.250 --> 04:48.860
What?

04:49.070 --> 04:49.890
Your mom?Your mom?

04:50.050 --> 04:51.430
She is not supposed to be on camera.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.650
your backstory is your mother is dead.

04:56.960 --> 04:57.960
What are you doing here?

04:58.100 --> 05:01.880
Well,this is the last place your
father will think to look for me.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.560
You know,when he suddenly retired,I thought
that we would travel,see the world,you know?

05:05.700 --> 05:07.660
See things we've never seen before.

05:07.800 --> 05:09.420
All he wants to do is have sex.

05:09.540 --> 05:13.190
I mean,it's fun,but certainly
nothing I haven't seen before.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.950
Oh,the one night you want the music
to be loud,and you hear every word.

05:16.070 --> 05:18.560
I mean,right now he thinks I'm at the
refrigerator getting whipped cream,

05:18.670 --> 05:22.040
but I saw my car keys on
the table,and I-I just ran.

05:22.180 --> 05:24.980
Well,obviously,you two are not on
the same page about his retirement.

05:25.110 --> 05:28.940
So why don't you,like,make a list of
all the things that you want to do now,

05:29.070 --> 05:32.050
compare 'em,and then decide
what you want to do first?

05:32.170 --> 05:35.130
Yeah,well,he's made a list,all right.

05:35.510 --> 05:37.540
I think he's been on the internet.

05:37.730 --> 05:39.480
Could you turn that up,please?

05:39.630 --> 05:40.920
yeah,just crank it.

05:41.720 --> 05:43.250
Sorry.I gotta finish up.

05:43.390 --> 05:44.250
Big date.

05:44.390 --> 05:45.650
Really?Lucky you.

05:45.800 --> 05:46.610
Is she pretty?

05:46.750 --> 05:47.390
Gorgeous.

05:47.540 --> 05:49.990
I mean,she'd have to be,since
she's kind of a flake.

05:50.210 --> 05:52.960
Well,perhaps that makes
her elusive and intriguing.

05:53.110 --> 05:54.760
you'd think,but no.

05:55.170 --> 05:58.130
Well,I happen to have a date myself.

05:58.380 --> 05:59.660
You should probably sleep with him.

05:59.800 --> 06:00.790
I heard guys like that.

06:01.080 --> 06:02.250
Oh,I don't kn

06:02.390 --> 06:03.760
I think this one might be gay.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.950
You should see what
he does with his hair.

06:09.990 --> 06:10.560
hello?

06:10.880 --> 06:11.600
Samantha?

06:12.400 --> 06:13.770
Did I catch you at a bad time?

06:13.970 --> 06:14.770
Uh,yes.

06:15.600 --> 06:16.270
What's up?

06:16.390 --> 06:19.520
I'm supposed to meet with senator
rudd at the harrison club tonight,

06:19.650 --> 06:24.900
but I was called away to new york for a
meeting,and I was hoping you would entertain him.

06:25.120 --> 06:26.810
Um,nope,I can'T.

06:26.950 --> 06:27.760
I have plans.

06:27.910 --> 06:28.930
Sure.Oh,okay.

06:29.080 --> 06:32.460
Just that senator rudd co-chairs
the senate finance committee,

06:32.610 --> 06:36.110
and you mentioned something about wanting the
foundation to be taken seriously,something like--

06:36.230 --> 06:37.220
doesn't matter.Okay,have a good time.

06:37.370 --> 06:38.430
No,no,no.

06:38.650 --> 06:39.340
wait.

06:40.270 --> 06:41.490
Damn it!

06:41.760 --> 06:42.900
Smart move,sam.

06:43.040 --> 06:47.450
And oh,uh,if he puts his hand on your
knee,he's just trying to stand up.

06:47.750 --> 06:48.970
You ready to go?

06:49.260 --> 06:51.360
Hey,you know what I was thinking?

06:51.570 --> 06:55.370
Why don't I go out for a couple of
hours and bring us back some takeout?

06:55.480 --> 06:56.080
What?

06:56.280 --> 06:58.650
No?Okay.Let's go.

Season 2 Episode 18</font>

07:07.840 --> 07:12.620
You know,todd,I was thinking,why don't we
just shake things up a little bit,you know?

07:12.760 --> 07:16.860
Maybe go someplace that we would
never,ever go to in a million years.

07:16.980 --> 07:18.800
But we have reservations at stingray.

07:18.910 --> 07:20.400
They're,like,impossible to get.

07:20.520 --> 07:26.440
No,I was thinking about this place that I've been
really,really wanting to try-- the,um,harrison club.

07:26.560 --> 07:28.410
that supper club where
the old people eat?

07:28.540 --> 07:30.860
And they stop serving at,like,8:30
when the salisbury steak runs out?

07:31.010 --> 07:32.370
Yeah!How cool is that?

07:32.500 --> 07:35.490
I mean,it's,you know,it's,like,so
unhip that it's hip.

07:35.550 --> 07:38.930
I mean,really,if it was any worse,it
would be impossible to get in.

07:39.060 --> 07:39.820
So come on!

07:39.940 --> 07:42.180
Let's go get us some supper.

07:42.360 --> 07:43.390
come on.

07:46.120 --> 07:47.030
Okay.

07:47.240 --> 07:48.380
I finished my list.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.440
Oh,good,good.This is fun,huh?

07:50.780 --> 07:56.990
Okay,the first thing I want to do is see venice,italy,before
it sinks into the ocean,now that you're retired.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.170
What do you want to see?

07:58.320 --> 07:59.490
"The x-files.

08:00.020 --> 08:01.100
" The tv show?

08:01.230 --> 08:03.100
Yeah.I ordered the whole thing on dvd.

08:05.490 --> 08:06.540
Okay.

08:09.210 --> 08:10.610
anything else you'd like to see?

08:10.820 --> 08:11.720
Africa?

08:11.900 --> 08:12.680
Russia?

08:12.810 --> 08:13.920
"Lonesome dove.

08:14.040 --> 08:15.170
" Never finished it.

08:15.910 --> 08:20.010
Anything else that might possibly not involve
you sitting around all day on your ass?

08:26.530 --> 08:27.550
howard!

08:27.680 --> 08:29.490
We talked about this.

08:29.650 --> 08:33.669
I want to see the
world,maybe get a second home,

08:33.820 --> 08:39.400
enjoy the freedom to do whatever we want
and go wherever we want whenever we want.

08:39.549 --> 08:41.370
This is our time,honey.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.419
Let's make the most of it.

08:44.059 --> 08:46.340
I'm sorry,hon.I...

08:46.480 --> 08:48.710
I was only thinking about myself.

08:49.240 --> 08:50.340
Thank you.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.120
Appreciate that.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.510
Want to take a shower?

09:01.100 --> 09:01.830
lovely.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.480
If you want to buy one,you
can pick it up on your way out.

09:04.650 --> 09:05.320
Thank you.

09:05.470 --> 09:06.390
Great.

09:07.980 --> 09:09.360
Isn't this cool?

09:10.030 --> 09:11.290
Cool,yes.

09:11.430 --> 09:12.780
Like a morgue.

09:13.180 --> 09:14.060
Senator?

09:17.490 --> 09:18.590
Senator?

09:18.730 --> 09:19.850
Where's my soup?

09:19.990 --> 09:21.400
I'm sorry.It's coming.

09:21.540 --> 09:23.240
Why are you calling everyone senator?

09:23.560 --> 09:25.840
Oh,um,you know,it's a term of respect.

09:25.970 --> 09:27.650
Sort of like,"evening,captain.

09:27.770 --> 09:29.870
Hello,senator." It's very classy.

09:30.040 --> 09:30.810
Senator?

09:30.950 --> 09:31.520
No.

09:31.660 --> 09:33.320
Okay.Okay,sam,what's going on?

09:33.470 --> 09:35.190
Tell me the truth and I won't be upset.

09:35.330 --> 09:38.910
Well,no,I will be,but not as upset
as if I find out that you're lying.

09:39.050 --> 09:39.960
Or probably the same.

09:40.130 --> 09:42.490
Actually,I don't see this
going well for you either way.

09:42.620 --> 09:43.910
Okay.

09:44.060 --> 09:47.820
Funk called before we left,and he said
I had to come here and meet this guy.

09:47.980 --> 09:49.340
Wait.So this is work?

09:49.490 --> 09:50.490
No!

09:50.680 --> 09:53.240
You and I,we're still on a date.

09:53.390 --> 09:56.960
But if a little work gets done in
the process,then guess who wins?

09:57.100 --> 09:57.920
Everybody.

09:58.060 --> 09:59.220
Except me.

09:59.350 --> 10:00.740
Yeah,well,maybe not you.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.340
Look,what was i supposed to do?

10:02.460 --> 10:03.560
Funk couldn't make it.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.100
Oh,good.You' here.

10:06.510 --> 10:08.520
Funk,what are you doing here?

10:08.650 --> 10:09.710
You're supposed to be in new york.

10:09.850 --> 10:13.020
Oh,they canceled that meeting,which
allows me to be here with you.

10:13.160 --> 10:14.820
Can you show us to our table,please?

10:15.090 --> 10:17.370
Funk,meet todd.

10:18.250 --> 10:20.520
Oh,hello.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.640
You're balder in person.

10:24.100 --> 10:29.020
You know,it's hard to balance dating
and work,so,dating,you stay here.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.930
Work,you come with me,okay?

10:33.480 --> 10:36.160
May I just say that you
look fantastic tonight?

10:36.360 --> 10:38.500
I always look more beautiful
standing next to a liar.

10:38.640 --> 10:40.410
You never had any plans in new york.

10:40.570 --> 10:43.060
You just got me here so
you could be alone with me.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.160
You know what?I'm on a date with todd.

10:45.290 --> 10:48.630
So you can go entertain
the senator by yourself

10:48.760 --> 10:51.020
- if there even is a senator.
-there is a senator.

10:51.240 --> 10:53.700
-But there's no todd,though.
-What?

11:00.520 --> 11:02.470
Thank god.I thought you left without me.

11:02.830 --> 11:03.840
oh,gosh.

11:03.980 --> 11:06.490
What,you two don't see
enough of each other all day?

11:06.680 --> 11:08.450
I didn't know he was gonna show up.

11:08.580 --> 11:11.960
How can you work side by sid with
a guy who wants to sleep with you?

11:12.090 --> 11:13.370
That's his problem.

11:13.510 --> 11:14.980
I mean,what do you
want me to do--quit?

11:15.120 --> 11:16.290
So you admit he wants to sleep with you?

11:16.420 --> 11:17.380
Jeez!

11:17.530 --> 11:19.570
For a first date,you
are awfully possessive.

11:19.700 --> 11:22.850
Not really a problem,since I'm pretty
sure there won't be a second date.

11:22.970 --> 11:25.020
I'm not attracted to my boss,todd.

11:25.140 --> 11:26.390
What if he wasn't your boss?

11:26.520 --> 11:27.760
I don't kn

11:27.890 --> 11:31.380
I mean,that's like asking me if--if I would be
attracted to my father if he wasn't my father.

11:31.520 --> 11:32.610
It's impossible to kn

11:32.750 --> 11:35.820
It's impossible to know if you'd
be attracted to your father?

11:35.950 --> 11:37.990
Have you seen pictures of
him when he was younger?

11:38.110 --> 11:39.830
He is a very dashing man.

11:39.960 --> 11:40.700
You--you know
what?You know what?

11:40.830 --> 11:41.570
Just forget it.

11:41.690 --> 11:42.860
Your cab's here.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.450
-You take it.
-No,no.Just take it.

11:44.560 --> 11:45.420
I'll get the next one.

11:45.560 --> 11:46.170
Oh,god.This is stupid.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.600
We're going to the same plE.It's
a waste of gas and money.

11:48.730 --> 11:49.290
Fine.

11:49.400 --> 11:50.170
Get in.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.070
But we're not talking.

11:51.240 --> 11:52.300
Oh,jeez.You think?

11:52.430 --> 11:53.600
I'm sitting up front.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.450
Sit on the hood for all I care.

11:56.890 --> 11:57.980
where to?

12:02.930 --> 12:04.550
it smells weird up there.

12:04.690 --> 12:06.340
I can taste it in my mouth.

12:08.000 --> 12:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:37.230 --> 12:38.090
what are you doing?

12:38.220 --> 12:40.650
When I come home from a crappy date,I
like to drink a beer and go to bed.

12:40.790 --> 12:45.720
Well,when I come home from a really crappy
date,I like to sion the couch and watch tv.

12:46.550 --> 12:50.850
Too bad,because the couch you like to sit
on happens to be the bed I like to sleep on.

12:57.700 --> 12:59.600
can I ask you a question...

12:59.750 --> 13:01.730
as my roommate?

13:02.400 --> 13:06.920
Was it really that bad that I
took my date to a work function?

13:07.070 --> 13:07.940
Yes.

13:08.070 --> 13:09.670
You're not todd.You're my roommate.

13:09.900 --> 13:12.870
Oh,as your roommate?Yeah.

13:13.190 --> 13:14.080
Yes.

13:14.910 --> 13:16.250
I need a different roommate.

13:16.410 --> 13:17.800
Now let me ask you one.

13:18.280 --> 13:19.880
I went out with
this crazy chick--

13:20.140 --> 13:21.640
Roommate.

13:22.010 --> 13:26.190
I may have overreacted to her
boss-- who's also her former lover--

13:26.340 --> 13:32.690
who showed up on our date and made a
jealous scene in front of an old folks' home.

13:32.840 --> 13:36.000
bro,you acted like a little bitch.

13:36.150 --> 13:36.800
Did you cry?

13:36.930 --> 13:38.400
Shut up.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.950
Think if I call her,she'll
go out with me again?

13:45.080 --> 13:47.550
Bro,no,you don't call her.

13:47.690 --> 13:49.510
You let her call you.

13:50.140 --> 13:57.760
It sounds like she may have had a little
something to do with what happened.

14:14.170 --> 14:16.530
she's probably out with some other guy.

14:19.760 --> 14:20.950
You'll do.

14:27.780 --> 14:28.640
Hold it.

14:29.950 --> 14:30.580
Thanks.

14:31.260 --> 14:37.400
Winston funk-- entrepreneur,jet-setter and
part of my inner circle of close friends.

14:37.620 --> 14:38.230
Andrea.

14:38.370 --> 14:39.470
You know my name?

14:39.620 --> 14:41.610
Of course you do,'cause
you're my close friend.

14:41.780 --> 14:45.330
Okay,guys,do you think we
can just drop the cameras?

14:45.510 --> 14:51.380
-Just for-- just for a few floors.
-yes!Yeah,if you-- turn 'em off.

14:54.330 --> 14:56.240
You're a friend of
samantha's aren't you?

14:56.620 --> 15:00.030
Uh-huh,as well as,um,sports
figures and entertainers.

15:00.960 --> 15:03.030
Great girl.Just...

15:04.220 --> 15:09.150
yeah,shmentioned something about,I
don't know,seeing her ex-boyfriend again.

15:09.280 --> 15:10.710
I mean,that's good,right?

15:12.740 --> 15:14.110
You sound concerned.

15:14.260 --> 15:15.180
Well,who wouldn't be?

15:15.330 --> 15:17.540
I mean,the boy sleeps where people sit.

15:17.700 --> 15:18.930
Interesting.

15:19.100 --> 15:21.210
He's,like,a starving artist
or something like that?

15:21.360 --> 15:22.040
Yeah.

15:22.190 --> 15:23.120
Photographer.

15:23.300 --> 15:24.050
Nothing special.

15:24.180 --> 15:26.840
Local stuff,you know,like
magazines and stuff.

15:28.070 --> 15:29.900
Well,maybe he'll get his big break.

15:33.700 --> 15:34.560
see you.

15:34.740 --> 15:35.690
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

15:35.900 --> 15:41.720
Great moment,a delicious moment-- almost
as delicious as hickory jack's smoked bacon.

15:41.860 --> 15:44.260
Put some bacon in your bag.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.050
Regina!

15:46.340 --> 15:47.280
Guess what?

15:47.540 --> 15:50.700
Don't tell me-- you finished
watching the second season of "alf.

15:50.860 --> 15:53.520
" Uh,no.I-I listened to
you,regina,and you were right.

15:53.630 --> 15:56.410
We need to travel and
have a-a second home,too,

15:56.570 --> 16:05.170
and--and go anywhere we want to go anytime we want
to go anywhere we want to go,anytime--where--places.

16:05.360 --> 16:06.450
really?

16:06.590 --> 16:07.780
You mean that?

16:08.280 --> 16:10.690
The solution was so easy.

16:11.020 --> 16:11.710
Look!

16:12.050 --> 16:12.910
Look!

16:16.690 --> 16:19.010
I call it "the regina.

16:21.420 --> 16:23.990
" I named her after you.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.110
sam?Yeah?

16:30.250 --> 16:31.710
I'm in the dining room.

16:36.670 --> 16:37.940
well,hello.

16:39.150 --> 16:41.130
What's,uh,going on here?

16:41.820 --> 16:45.220
Well,tonight was supposed
to be our second date,

16:45.430 --> 16:48.760
and I realized what went
wrong with the first one.

16:48.890 --> 16:50.100
We were out.

16:50.430 --> 16:54.300
so just thought we would stay
home in a controlled environment,

16:54.430 --> 16:56.150
where no work can interrupt us.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.720
I told frank no visitors.

16:57.860 --> 17:01.420
I unplugged the computer,and
I mailed myself my cell phone,

17:01.710 --> 17:04.619
so that should be gone
for a couple of days.

17:04.839 --> 17:08.960
So now it's just you
and me,a romantic dinner.

17:09.140 --> 17:11.690
I think you know what that means.

17:11.869 --> 17:12.390
SaM...

17:12.730 --> 17:17.900
I got an unbelievable job offer to
be the photo editor of a magazine.

17:18.099 --> 17:19.420
It's in london.

17:20.420 --> 17:21.920
They want me to leave tomorr

17:24.220 --> 17:26.420
no,silly.

17:26.630 --> 17:28.440
It means we're gonna have sex...

17:29.020 --> 17:29.680
that's what.

17:31.130 --> 17:32.260
London?

17:32.540 --> 17:33.530
I don't understand.

17:33.740 --> 17:34.750
Wait.Y-you don't
understand london,or--

17:34.890 --> 17:36.860
no,I understand london,todd.

17:36.990 --> 17:38.210
Well--well,I don't
kn.With the amnesia--

17:38.350 --> 17:40.560
I mean,you thought harry
potter was the 33rd president.

17:40.700 --> 17:46.510
I'm just saying that,you know,as your roommate,I
would have liked to have had a little bit more notice.

17:46.640 --> 17:47.720
Well,I haven't taken the job yet.

17:47.810 --> 17:49.870
I-I thought I'd discuss
it with you first.

17:49.990 --> 17:51.080
Me?

17:52.650 --> 17:53.450
Okay.

17:54.610 --> 17:55.910
I...

17:56.070 --> 17:58.090
it's a--it's a-- it's
a great opportunity.

17:58.230 --> 18:00.110
So you think I should take it?

18:00.310 --> 18:03.830
I mean,I-I can't answer that.

18:03.960 --> 18:08.040
I mean,it's not like I
can ask you to stay,right?

18:08.170 --> 18:09.750
Yeah,and I can't ask you to move,right?

18:09.890 --> 18:10.610
It's not like
you and I are--

18:10.730 --> 18:12.140
well,no.We had one date.

18:12.280 --> 18:12.890
I kn.I kn

18:13.020 --> 18:14.720
Who moves with a guy to
london after one date?

18:14.840 --> 18:15.600
A crazy lady.

18:15.730 --> 18:18.130
Yeah,it would have to
be one hell of a date.

18:18.270 --> 18:20.800
Yeah.Just...yeah.

18:22.700 --> 18:25.200
This is...yeah.This is...

18:25.630 --> 18:27.310
this is your big chance.

18:27.910 --> 18:28.830
Yeah.

18:29.830 --> 18:33.250
And you finally got the
job you always wanted.

18:33.390 --> 18:34.280
Yeah.

18:35.510 --> 18:37.060
And we can still talk all
the time.We have phones.

18:37.180 --> 18:38.880
It's not like I'm on
the moon or something.

18:39.010 --> 18:40.420
Oh,yeah.I--

18:40.550 --> 18:42.990
even if you were on the moon,I'm
sure we could still talk,you know?

18:43.110 --> 18:45.030
The phones these day anD...

18:45.220 --> 18:46.640
the roaming.

18:49.190 --> 18:51.340
so you're happy for me?

18:51.600 --> 18:53.300
I've never been happier.

18:53.990 --> 18:55.060
Yay!

19:11.990 --> 19:13.280
Todd?

19:31.800 --> 19:32.700
todd?

19:34.100 --> 19:35.880
Hey,dad,what's going on?

19:36.930 --> 19:38.550
What do you mean,you're here?

19:45.700 --> 19:47.310
what the hell is this?

19:47.820 --> 19:49.610
Funny,I said exactly the same thing.

19:49.740 --> 19:51.360
Remember I said that,howard?

19:51.490 --> 19:54.260
You and I said exactly the same thing.

19:54.390 --> 19:58.530
Yeah,we're gonna follow the dream,sammy--
see the world just like your mother wanted.

19:58.640 --> 20:03.770
Just remember-- if the R.V.'S
rockin',don't come a-knockin'.

20:03.910 --> 20:05.460
Knock,samantha.

20:06.190 --> 20:07.680
Knock all you want!

20:11.370 --> 20:12.790
Late again?

20:12.930 --> 20:14.510
You are putting us all to shame.

20:16.300 --> 20:18.760
Oh,no.I finished a long time ago.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.350
You know,once you start watching videos of
cats doing funny things,you really can't stop.

20:24.680 --> 20:25.420
look at that.

20:25.560 --> 20:27.160
That cat's riding a dog.

20:27.330 --> 20:28.630
It's like...

20:29.020 --> 20:29.820
it's friday night.

20:29.950 --> 20:32.000
Why aren't you out with that todd?

20:32.150 --> 20:33.780
He moved to london for a job.

20:33.920 --> 20:34.910
London?Really?

20:36.390 --> 20:38.150
I'm really sorry to hear about that.

20:39.260 --> 20:40.670
Sure you are.

20:41.460 --> 20:44.340
Listen,I dusted off
a 1970-- I don't care.

20:44.480 --> 20:46.020
Just pour.

20:48.070 --> 20:52.810
