what the hell is
going on down here?

01:02.427 --> 01:05.530
Oh, good morning, arch.
I hope the noise
didn't disturb you.

01:05.597 --> 01:08.767
Oh, no. I enjoyed it.

01:08.834 --> 01:12.637
That's why I came downstairs,
so I could hear it better.

01:12.705 --> 01:14.873
What are you doing?

01:16.042 --> 01:19.110
Oh, geez.

01:19.178 --> 01:22.613
"Peace, yes.
Pentagon, no."

01:22.682 --> 01:25.850
Boy, you sure know
how to start my day out,
don't you?

01:25.918 --> 01:29.721
Hey, Edith.
Yeah, Archie!
Here's your coffee.

01:29.789 --> 01:32.557
This meathead here
is aggravatin' me
on an empty stomach.

01:32.624 --> 01:36.094
Maybe that's because
you haven't had
your breakfast yet.

01:43.402 --> 01:46.404
You figured that out,
huh, Edith?

01:46.471 --> 01:50.641
Yeah.
Well, maybe
there's something
you could do about it.

01:50.710 --> 01:54.579
Well, I could get you
your breakfast.

01:55.581 --> 01:58.083
You're a pip, Edith.

01:58.150 --> 02:01.720
Now, where you goin'
with the coffee?
Oh, I'm sorry, Archie.

02:01.787 --> 02:05.289
Here. I'll get you
your eggs right away.

02:05.357 --> 02:08.793
I painted another one,
Michael. See?
And it's dry now.

02:08.860 --> 02:12.363
Oh, yeah, good.
Oh, another one.
Let me look at this here.

02:12.431 --> 02:15.700
"Stop the military
from wagin' war on us."

02:15.768 --> 02:18.837
Now, what are you doin',
involving her in one of
your pinko protests?

02:18.904 --> 02:21.372
Oh, don't worry, arch.
She's gonna stay home.

02:21.440 --> 02:24.008
She's gonna
type up my term paper.
She's not comin' with me.

02:24.076 --> 02:26.444
And it isn't
a pinko protest, daddy.

02:26.511 --> 02:28.479
Well, what do you
call it then?

02:28.547 --> 02:31.382
It just happens to be
one of the biggest
student demonstrations...

02:31.450 --> 02:35.153
Against Pentagon control
of our government
this city has ever seen.

02:35.221 --> 02:37.889
Ah, geez.
And what's more,
I'm proud of my husband.

02:37.957 --> 02:41.292
At least he takes some
responsibility for what's
going on in this world.

02:41.360 --> 02:43.895
What about work?

02:43.963 --> 02:46.497
That's one of the things
going on in this world.

02:46.565 --> 02:49.167
When is he gonna
take some responsibility
for that?

02:49.235 --> 02:51.569
Daddy, he's busy
with his books
and his studying--

02:51.637 --> 02:54.505
yeah, and all that
commie crapola.

02:56.175 --> 02:59.043
Get that treason
off of my chair.

03:00.512 --> 03:03.414
Arch, when are you gonna
stop with this commie jazz?

03:03.482 --> 03:05.817
It's all over, arch.
The red scare's kaput.

03:05.885 --> 03:07.819
Nixon's going to Peking,
remember?

03:07.887 --> 03:10.221
Hold it, buddy.
He ain't there yet.

03:10.289 --> 03:12.657
What's that
supposed to mean?

03:12.724 --> 03:16.560
Five presidents
have been warnin' us
for the last 25 years...

03:16.628 --> 03:18.729
Against them red chinks.

03:18.798 --> 03:22.733
Now, nobody is gonna tell me
that the signals is off now...

03:22.802 --> 03:25.369
And a billion enemies
is now our friends.

03:25.437 --> 03:28.239
Oh, no. Mr. Nixon has got
somethin' up the sleeve.

03:28.307 --> 03:31.976
Yeah, like recommending
they be admitted
to the u.N.

03:32.044 --> 03:35.113
Oh, that'd be the day when
this country sits down...

03:35.181 --> 03:38.649
With a nation of
chink ping-pong players
who don't believe in God.

03:41.220 --> 03:43.888
Daddy! Then why is
Nixon going there...

03:43.956 --> 03:45.957
If he doesn't intend
to recognize them?
Right!

03:46.025 --> 03:49.928
Listen, in the first place,
he can't recognize 'em.

03:49.995 --> 03:52.030
They all look alike.

03:55.234 --> 03:57.768
And in the second place,
you mark my words.

03:57.837 --> 04:01.472
He's got some--
what do you call--
grand strategy there...

04:01.540 --> 04:04.542
That he can't "revulge"
to us as yet.

04:04.609 --> 04:07.979
That's what it is.
I mean, otherwise,
the past 25 years,

04:08.047 --> 04:10.414
the whole country
should've stood in bed.

04:10.482 --> 04:12.450
[ Sniffs ]
Geez, these sinuses
are murder.

04:12.517 --> 04:14.452
They fog up my whole head.

04:14.519 --> 04:17.055
Well, that explains
everything.

04:25.464 --> 04:27.398
Funny. Funny!

04:27.466 --> 04:29.667
Here's your breakfast,
Archie.

04:29.735 --> 04:33.771
Hey, Edith, let me ask you.
Did you open the bedroom
window last night?

04:33.839 --> 04:37.675
Did I open the window?

04:37.743 --> 04:41.679
Are your sinuses
bothering you?
Yeah.

04:41.747 --> 04:44.983
Your head all clogged up
and you can hardly breathe?

04:45.050 --> 04:49.120
- Yeah.
- Then I opened the window.

04:50.689 --> 04:52.623
Breakfast, everybody!

04:52.691 --> 04:55.159
Oh, ma, I hope you don't
mind if I eat fast,

04:55.227 --> 04:57.161
but I don't wanna
get there late with the signs.

04:57.229 --> 04:59.163
Oh, what happens
if you get there late,

04:59.231 --> 05:03.268
you gotta bring a note
to your commissar?
Ha ha.

05:03.335 --> 05:06.470
All this marchin'
and protestin',
what does it get you, huh?

05:06.538 --> 05:08.839
Last week you was
marchin' against poverty.

05:08.908 --> 05:12.310
That's right, because last week,
millions of Americans
went to bed hungry.

05:12.378 --> 05:17.782
Tell 'em not to march.
They won't work up
such a big appetite.

05:17.849 --> 05:20.985
I don't know why
you're so upset, Archie.

05:21.053 --> 05:23.721
I remember when
you used to picket.

05:23.789 --> 05:25.823
That was different, Edith.

05:25.891 --> 05:28.192
I was walkin' a picket line
for my union,

05:28.260 --> 05:31.762
and I wasn't out
screamin' in the streets,
blockin' traffic.

05:31.830 --> 05:34.165
When we picketed,
we done it
the American way:

05:34.233 --> 05:36.267
On the sidewalks,
dressed nice,

05:36.335 --> 05:40.204
walkin' up and down
with our signs,
peaceful, no violence.

05:40.272 --> 05:42.573
Except when somebody
crossed the line.

05:42.641 --> 05:44.575
Then you broke his head.

05:49.248 --> 05:52.583
It's the only way
to teach a scab
a lesson.

05:52.651 --> 05:56.154
That was not
violence, Edith.
That was education.

05:58.223 --> 06:02.860
Besides, if you people think
you're gonna get somewhere
with your type of protest,

06:02.928 --> 06:05.063
I'm telling ya,
youse are dreamin'!

06:05.130 --> 06:09.700
I was dreaming
last night.
Ah, geez.

06:09.768 --> 06:11.869
I dreamed--
[ Laughs ]

06:11.937 --> 06:13.972
You'll never believe this.

06:14.039 --> 06:17.442
Good. Then there
ain't no point
in tellin' it.

06:17.509 --> 06:20.178
I wanna hear the story, ma.
Tell me.
<i>[ Edith laughs ]</i>

06:20.245 --> 06:25.416
I was in
the miss America contest!
[ Laughing ]

06:26.585 --> 06:29.053
Who were you, Edith?
Bert parks?

06:33.825 --> 06:39.330
No! Even Bert parks
wasn't Bert parks.

06:39.398 --> 06:43.934
He was senator proxmire.

06:44.003 --> 06:46.670
I don't know
who senator proxmire is,

06:46.738 --> 06:50.341
but I kept hearing his name
on the radio all day yesterday.

06:50.409 --> 06:52.343
And it's one of those words.

06:52.411 --> 06:58.149
"Proxmire, proxmire, proxmire,
proxmire, proxmire."

06:59.784 --> 07:02.586
Well, anyway, there I was,

07:02.654 --> 07:06.624
this beautiful girl
in a bathing suit.

07:09.028 --> 07:11.595
Oh, you were there too,
Archie.

07:11.663 --> 07:15.166
Another beautiful girl
in a bathing suit.

07:17.102 --> 07:19.237
Funny, funny.

07:19.304 --> 07:22.306
Leave me out of
your dreams, will ya?
Oh, I can't, Archie.

07:22.374 --> 07:25.976
You were one of the judges,
and that made me feel better...

07:26.045 --> 07:31.215
'Cause I knew I could
count on Archie's vote
come hell or high water.

07:31.283 --> 07:35.219
"Hell or high water"?
Ma, I never heard you use
an expression like that.

07:35.287 --> 07:40.124
That was the theme song.
You sang it to me, Archie,

07:40.192 --> 07:43.361
in the rowboat
just before you kissed me.

07:43.429 --> 07:48.099
¶ Come hell or high water
I'll vote for you ¶
Edith, Edith!

07:48.167 --> 07:51.269
Please, please!
If you got any
pity in you at all,

07:51.336 --> 07:54.972
no more
musical dreams, huh?
<i>[ Doorbell rings ]</i>

07:55.040 --> 07:57.942
That's probably Lionel.
Right on time.

07:58.009 --> 07:59.944
Be right there, Lionel!

08:01.046 --> 08:03.147
Hey, come on in.
How's it going?

08:03.215 --> 08:05.883
Hi, Lionel.
Would you like
a cup of coffee?

08:05.951 --> 08:09.253
No, thanks, Mrs. bunker.
No, ma. We gotta
get goin'. Let's go.

08:09.321 --> 08:11.255
I don't know if I'm in
that big a rush, Mike.

08:11.323 --> 08:13.491
I've been thinking
about passin' up
this demonstration.

08:13.559 --> 08:15.926
Hey, hey,
what's this I hear?

08:15.994 --> 08:19.197
Here's a guy that knows
his onions over here.

08:19.264 --> 08:24.835
You know, youse people
got more brains than they
give youse credit for, Lionel.

08:24.903 --> 08:27.105
Hey, Lionel, how come
you changed your mind?

08:27.172 --> 08:29.540
'Cause he's smart,
that's why, meathead.

08:29.608 --> 08:34.278
Minorities like Lionel, they
gotta be careful about calling
attraction to themselves.

08:34.346 --> 08:37.081
You know, there are
some whites that got it in
for your coloreds.

08:39.150 --> 08:41.251
That's why your coloreds
have to behave better.

08:41.320 --> 08:44.020
They gotta act nicer.
They gotta try harder.

08:44.089 --> 08:46.991
Yeah, that's right.
We's like avis.
Check.

08:51.363 --> 08:53.697
Look, Mike,
the reason I was thinkin'
of not goin' is,

08:53.765 --> 08:56.501
see, I was talkin'
to my cousin Spencer
on the police force--

08:56.568 --> 08:59.637
hey, Lionel, I didn't know
you had a cousin a cop.
I never heard that.

08:59.704 --> 09:02.740
Yeah, well,
he the white sheep
of the family.

09:09.481 --> 09:11.415
Anyway--

09:11.483 --> 09:14.385
anyway, Spencer's been
called to a special detail
down at the u.N.

09:14.453 --> 09:16.820
There's a couple
of big groups gonna be
counterprotesting,

09:16.888 --> 09:20.625
- and they're expecting
some trouble.
- Maybe you better not go.

09:20.692 --> 09:24.094
Gloria, I gotta go.
I promised I'd be there.
Come on, Lionel.

09:24.163 --> 09:26.096
Leave him alone!

09:26.165 --> 09:28.732
Why should he go down there
and picket the military?

09:28.800 --> 09:31.502
The military's been
damn good to his people--

09:31.570 --> 09:36.207
taking 'em off the streets,
giving 'em three squares
a day, lotta fancy uniforms.

09:36.275 --> 09:38.609
Allowing 'em
to die in Vietnam.

09:38.677 --> 09:43.080
Well, now, Lionel, you gotta
take the bad with the good.

09:43.148 --> 09:46.950
Archie, good is not spending
over 50 cents out of every
dollar on the military.

09:47.018 --> 09:48.952
The military gives jobs.

09:49.020 --> 09:52.223
How's his people gonna find work
if you cut off them jobs
at the source?

09:52.291 --> 09:55.193
But, Archie, I don't want
the source of jobs
to be the military.

09:55.260 --> 09:57.761
That's just the kind of thinking
I'm going downtown to protest.

09:57.829 --> 10:00.665
Yeah, well,
he ain't going with you.
Yes, I am.

10:00.732 --> 10:02.700
Huh?
You convinced me to go.

10:02.767 --> 10:05.503
How'd I do that?
Just logic, Mr. bunker.

10:05.571 --> 10:08.005
I mean,
you got it up here.

10:08.073 --> 10:10.508
You ready, Mike?
Yeah.

10:10.576 --> 10:13.678

please don't go.

Gloria, honey, don't worry.
Everything's gonna
be all right.

10:16.515 --> 10:19.116
Talk to you later.
Come on, Lionel.
Bye, everybody.

10:19.184 --> 10:21.752

Ma, I'm worried.
I don't think
he should've gone.

10:30.795 --> 10:32.763
He could get hurt
or arrested.

10:32.831 --> 10:38.068
Listen, listen, nobody gets
arrested in this country
unless they deserve it.

10:38.136 --> 10:40.070
If he don't go
callin' cops "pigs"...

10:40.138 --> 10:43.441

all right. Bye.

11:02.261 --> 11:04.194
Ma, that was
Lionel's mother.

11:04.263 --> 11:08.098
She said Spencer called,
and they put on 200 extra
police down at the u.N.

11:08.166 --> 11:10.100
They're expecting
big trouble.

11:10.168 --> 11:12.336
Oh, my!
Daddy, will you
run after Michael...

11:12.404 --> 11:16.440
And stop him before
he gets on the subway?
He's already at the subway.

11:16.508 --> 11:18.809
Well, then go down to the u.N.
And bring him home.

11:18.877 --> 11:23.814
Are you kiddin'?
Me go to a commie
demonstration?

11:23.882 --> 11:26.317
Wild hornets
couldn't drag me there.

11:26.385 --> 11:29.119
Ma, get daddy to do it,
please? I'm scared.

11:29.187 --> 11:33.724
You better go down there.
Why don't she go
down there herself?

11:33.792 --> 11:37.295
Because he won't like
my interfering. I know him.
He won't even listen to me.

11:37.362 --> 11:39.997
Do you think he's gonna
listen to me? I've been
living with him a year,

11:40.064 --> 11:41.999
he ain't heard
a word I said yet.

11:42.066 --> 11:44.568
Daddy, I've seen it
on the newsreels.

11:44.636 --> 11:47.705
They beat those kids with clubs
and they haul 'em into jail...

11:47.773 --> 11:49.707

Only the troublemakers.

hundreds of 'em in...

standin' watchin'.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.987

Daddy, listen,
if Michael gets arrested,

12:10.662 --> 12:13.397
they'll book him
and fingerprint him
and it'll be on his record,

12:13.465 --> 12:15.499
and then when he goes
to look for a job--

12:15.567 --> 12:18.101
when? When? When?

12:20.806 --> 12:24.775
All right. All right.
Since I don't have a father,
I'll do it myself.

12:24.843 --> 12:26.777
And what's that
supposed to mean,
you ain't got a father?

12:26.845 --> 12:30.581
I said I'll go
down there myself.
No! Now, Gloria, wait, please!

12:30.649 --> 12:34.084

Don't let her do it.

What kind of talk
is that out of her,
she don't have a father?

12:36.988 --> 12:40.257
Well, maybe she means
she don't have one
when she needs one.

12:40.325 --> 12:42.259
And what are you doin',
takin' her part?
Yeah.

12:42.327 --> 12:44.795

And I'm going with you!

around here?

been home by now.

13:32.977 --> 13:35.846
Oh, now, Gloria,
don't worry.

13:35.914 --> 13:40.584
I'm sure Mike
is all right.
Let's turn on the tv.

13:40.652 --> 13:44.422
Maybe there's some news.
Oh, the news ain't on now.

13:44.489 --> 13:49.527
Now you got
bright promise, secret storm
and <i>the newlywed game.</i>

13:49.594 --> 13:53.130
But if something was happening,
they'd break into the program
with a special bulletin.

13:53.197 --> 13:58.502
Oh, I don't think
they're allowed to break in
on <i>the newlywed game.</i>

14:00.038 --> 14:04.909
Sit down, Gloria.
Now, let's talk about
something else,

14:04.976 --> 14:08.913
something that'll
take your mind off Mike.
I don't think I can, ma.

14:08.980 --> 14:14.217
Gloria, do you remember
tubby Mr. Murdoch?

14:14.285 --> 14:16.720
Tubby Mr. Murdoch.
We used to live
next to them...

14:16.788 --> 14:19.156
On union street
when I was about 11.

14:19.223 --> 14:23.594
That's right,
in the apartment that
always smelled like vinegar.

14:23.662 --> 14:28.666
Yeah.
Well, if I was
to tell you a secret...

14:28.733 --> 14:33.303
About tubby Mr. Murdoch
and your father...

14:33.371 --> 14:37.240
And a lie I told this morning.

14:37.308 --> 14:43.080
- You told a lie this morning?
- Yeah, in my miss America
beauty contest dream.

14:43.147 --> 14:45.382
Tubby Mr. Murdoch
wasn't in the dream.

14:45.450 --> 14:48.151
Yes, he was.
[ Giggles ]

14:48.219 --> 14:52.422
He was the one that
kissed me in the rowboat,
not your father.

14:52.491 --> 14:54.525
[ Laughing ]

14:54.593 --> 14:57.027
Ma, no!

14:57.095 --> 15:00.531
His kiss was very vinegary.

15:00.599 --> 15:03.066
Not tubby Mr. Murdoch!

15:03.134 --> 15:05.068
I had to say
it was your father...

15:05.136 --> 15:09.072
Because if he ever heard
that anybody else kissed me
in a rowboat,

15:09.140 --> 15:11.709
even in a dream,
he'd have a fit!

15:11.776 --> 15:14.444
He sure would!
That's funny!

15:14.513 --> 15:18.348
I'm glad you liked it.

15:18.416 --> 15:21.819
And see how it
took your mind off Mike?

15:25.891 --> 15:30.427
Oh, Gloria, I'm sorry.
Oh, Michael.

15:30.495 --> 15:34.231
Let me fix you a cup of tea.
That'll make you feel better.

15:34.298 --> 15:36.266
All right, ma.

15:36.334 --> 15:39.302
Michael!
Where have you been?

15:39.370 --> 15:42.940
Look at your shirt!
What did they do to you?
What happened?

15:43.008 --> 15:46.209
Well, Gloria, it--

15:46.277 --> 15:49.179
first, it started out
peaceful. You know,
we just sort of,

15:49.247 --> 15:52.616
you know, marching up and down
in front of the u.N.

15:52.684 --> 15:56.386
But then this other group
comes along and they start
protesting against us.

15:56.454 --> 15:59.489
And then this guy from
this other group jumps up
on his buddy's shoulders,

15:59.558 --> 16:01.491
rips open his shirt,
and right there it says,

16:01.560 --> 16:03.727
"America.
Love it or leave it."

16:03.795 --> 16:06.730
A real tattoo burned
right into his chest.

16:06.798 --> 16:08.732
And then a guy
from our group jumps up,
and he says, "oh, yeah?

16:08.800 --> 16:10.734
Well, we love it,
so why don't you leave it?"

16:10.802 --> 16:13.837
And then, before
you know it, Gloria,
there's food and rocks...

16:13.905 --> 16:16.640
And bottles flying
all over the place
like you can't believe it.

16:16.708 --> 16:19.509
And then the cops
started comin' in, and
there were hundreds of 'em.

16:19.578 --> 16:21.511
So Lionel and I,
w-we started to run,

16:21.580 --> 16:24.715
but just as we turned around,
Gloria, standing there,
right in front of us,

16:24.783 --> 16:28.052
was the biggest,
tallest, meanest cop...

16:28.119 --> 16:33.023
With this gigantic head
and a face like ed Sullivan.

16:33.091 --> 16:35.025
And just as he was
about to grab us,

16:35.093 --> 16:37.561
from out of nowhere
comes this naked lady.
A naked lady?

16:37.629 --> 16:40.230
Yeah! There was this
beautiful naked lady,

16:40.298 --> 16:42.700
and she comes
right up to ed Sullivan,

16:42.767 --> 16:45.936
jumps in his arms
and punches him
right in the face.

16:46.004 --> 16:48.472
Couldn't believe it.
But Lionel and I figured
this is our chance to get away,

16:48.539 --> 16:51.008
so we dropped down
to our knees, and we start
crawling out of there...

16:51.076 --> 16:53.811
Between hundreds of legs
as fast as we could
and we escaped.

16:53.878 --> 16:56.714
Do we have any cheese?

16:56.781 --> 17:00.317
I'm hungry.
Oh, yeah.
I'll get it right away.

17:04.255 --> 17:08.791
- Archie?
- Michael, I forgot to tell you.

17:08.859 --> 17:11.862
I sent daddy down there
to look for you.

17:11.930 --> 17:14.897
Why?
'Cause I was worried.

17:14.965 --> 17:17.067
Yeah, but, Gloria,
how could he find me?

17:17.135 --> 17:19.069
I mean, the place
was a madhouse.

17:19.137 --> 17:21.371

yelling screaming.

Don't worry, bunker.
With any luck at all,

24:01.805 --> 24:04.307
you should be out within
three or four hours.

24:13.284 --> 24:15.585
Here's your beer, Archie.

24:15.653 --> 24:18.388
And another sandwich, daddy,
just the way you like it.

24:18.456 --> 24:21.858
I wanna tell youse all
you got a lot
to answer for.

24:21.926 --> 24:24.261
Especially you, meathead.
It was all your fault.

24:24.328 --> 24:28.198
- Me? What did I do?
- You was born a polack.
That's what you did.

24:31.269 --> 24:33.270
That's why I had to stay
in that station house
for three hours,

24:33.337 --> 24:36.839
starin' at that
big, dumb sergeant
'cause you didn't warn me.

24:36.907 --> 24:38.841
What did you
want me to do, arch?

24:38.909 --> 24:43.346
Send up a signal flag saying,
"shut your dumb mouth.
Sgt. Pulaski's Polish"?

24:43.414 --> 24:45.648
Instead of
being mad at Michael,
you ought to thank him.

24:45.716 --> 24:49.419
- He bailed you out.
- How much the bail bond
cost us?

24:49.487 --> 24:52.021
- Nothin'.
- What do you mean, nothin'?

24:52.090 --> 24:54.824
Them bondsmen don't hand over
their shekels for nothin'.

24:54.892 --> 24:57.060
Yeah, but I didn't go
to a bail bondsman.

24:57.128 --> 24:59.496
I got the money
from the freedom fund.

25:03.968 --> 25:09.106
- The which?
- It's money used to free
protestors who get arrested.

25:13.877 --> 25:16.313
You're out of jail courtesy
of your friends, arch--

25:16.380 --> 25:18.582
the pinkos, the meatheads
and the freaks.

25:43.207 --> 25:47.644
