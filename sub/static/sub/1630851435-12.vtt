WEBVTT

01:42.936 --> 01:43.770
Wha--

01:46.356 --> 01:48.358
What the hell is this?

01:52.237 --> 01:54.030
Th-This is…

01:55.532 --> 01:56.533
a sphere!

01:57.867 --> 01:59.786
Of course we were surprised.

01:59.869 --> 02:01.371
He was completely round.

02:01.454 --> 02:03.790
A human had turned himself into a ball!

02:04.374 --> 02:08.670
Like that animal, you know? The armadillo?

02:08.753 --> 02:10.797
Like that. Exactly like that.

02:11.714 --> 02:13.967
Being in this line of work,

02:14.050 --> 02:16.302
I learned martial arts as well.

02:16.386 --> 02:20.056
So that technique?
I understand how incredible it is.

02:20.974 --> 02:25.061
Martial arts techniques
often use the joints.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.564
In other words, the corners of the body.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.817
The human body is full of corners.

02:31.401 --> 02:34.070
But if it's like this?

02:34.654 --> 02:38.825
Baki was shocked.
It was obvious from his expression.

02:39.617 --> 02:44.122
I mean, once he did that, the 0.5 seconds
of unconsciousness was meaningless.

02:44.664 --> 02:47.208
But he is the son of the devil.

02:48.668 --> 02:51.546
He did a jump back kick.
It was impressive.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.715
That's the strongest kick move.

02:54.382 --> 02:55.341
But…

02:59.929 --> 03:01.222
he was repelled!

03:02.056 --> 03:05.351
He himself was taken aback
by the unexpected feeling,

03:05.852 --> 03:08.188
but it rang a bell for me.

03:09.814 --> 03:13.109
It was back when
I helped serve Mister his meal.

03:13.985 --> 03:17.864
Mister had emptied several bottles of wine
and was in a good mood.

03:17.947 --> 03:21.618
That's when he showed us
something interesting.

03:23.912 --> 03:24.871
Watch.

03:28.958 --> 03:33.630
Incredibly, his flexed biceps began
to move until it reached his shoulder,

03:34.380 --> 03:35.882
passed behind his head,

03:36.466 --> 03:38.635
to his arm on the other side.

03:39.260 --> 03:41.888
By flexing his muscles in order,

03:41.971 --> 03:45.391
he gave a performance that made it
seem as if the bicep was moving.

03:45.975 --> 03:48.394
I suppose you can call it muscle control.

03:49.145 --> 03:52.523
Mister can make it happen
in several areas simultaneously.

03:53.149 --> 03:56.653
In other words,
he can flex any part of his body.

03:57.612 --> 04:00.406
Baki was likely repelled
due to that ability.

04:00.990 --> 04:04.911
The force of Baki's strike
was repelled by an inner counter force.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.664
That's why he doesn't roll.

04:09.415 --> 04:10.667
I just remembered.

04:11.542 --> 04:14.420
Now that I think about it,
the same thing happened before.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.173
Kureha Shinogi.

04:17.799 --> 04:19.425
He did the same thing.

04:20.677 --> 04:24.180
You have such a difference
in muscle mass, I didn't notice.

04:24.681 --> 04:25.932
But it was the same.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.434
Probably the same way to break it too.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.186
Try it.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.188
Go ahead and try

04:32.272 --> 04:34.941
the move that saved you then.

04:36.567 --> 04:38.361
You're well-informed.

04:39.737 --> 04:42.073
Well, there doesn't seem to be another way

04:43.241 --> 04:45.451
and I was gonna do it anyway!

04:47.537 --> 04:49.330
Goutaijutsu.

04:50.915 --> 04:52.333
In my days at the Academy,

04:53.001 --> 04:55.837
a 60 kg teacher showed us the miracle.

04:56.921 --> 04:59.757
We prepared a bowling bowl as a joke,

05:02.844 --> 05:04.804
but he destroyed it in one strike.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.223
According to him,

05:07.807 --> 05:12.228
dozens of joints are put into motion
in a chop movement.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.273
Meaning there are dozens of cushions--

05:15.815 --> 05:18.735
or shock absorbers.

05:18.818 --> 05:22.989
This cushion is the greatest obstacle
to the force of a strike.

05:24.532 --> 05:29.746
But if you could make that cushion
completely rigid,

05:30.330 --> 05:32.332
a person could become an iron ball.

05:32.832 --> 05:36.002
My weight is 60 kg,

05:36.085 --> 05:38.504
so I can become a 60 kg iron ball.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.258
It's only natural the bowling bowl
would break.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.260
However,

05:44.844 --> 05:49.265
it wouldn't work as well
against a moving human.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.017
Goutaijutsu.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.978
I am still in stages of trying
to master it.

05:59.067 --> 05:59.984
The sound…

06:00.068 --> 06:02.987
How can that be the sound
of a person hitting a person?

06:04.238 --> 06:06.366
We watched with bated breath.

06:07.200 --> 06:11.162
Five seconds, ten seconds…
No, maybe it was three seconds.

06:12.497 --> 06:13.414
Then it happened.

06:27.845 --> 06:30.598
The battle was full of unbelievable moves,

06:30.681 --> 06:35.311
but still… but still,
that scene made my heart drop.

06:36.938 --> 06:39.315
He swallowed a person whole.

06:40.525 --> 06:41.818
Like Pac-Man?

06:41.901 --> 06:45.321
What the hell is going on in there?

06:45.405 --> 06:47.824
It's beyond our imagination,

06:48.408 --> 06:49.909
but this was also part of it.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.080
Even this is part of the fight.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.593
I recalled my childhood.

07:11.806 --> 07:15.518
The dragonfly I had just caught,
full of vitality.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.603
I didn't have an insect cage,

07:17.687 --> 07:20.231
so I gently palmed it,
trying not to hurt it.

07:21.023 --> 07:23.901
I hurried home to my house
a few blocks ahead.

07:25.736 --> 07:28.406
The dragonfly I released onto my desk
was so weakened,

07:28.489 --> 07:30.491
it was like a different dragonfly.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.244
I had carried it so gently too.

07:33.953 --> 07:37.498
I learned a painful lesson in exchange
for the precious treasure.

07:38.082 --> 07:40.418
The act of trapping a living being,

07:40.501 --> 07:43.754
will cause it stress
and impact its vitality.

07:44.464 --> 07:48.634
In Baki's case, he was gripped
in Oliva's full-strength vise.

07:51.137 --> 07:54.474
I can braise you, grill you, trample you--

07:55.057 --> 07:57.518
I can do whatever I want with you now.

07:58.603 --> 08:03.149
If this was a match in the ring with rules

08:03.232 --> 08:06.027
it would've been a one-round win for me.

08:07.528 --> 08:09.405
But unfortunately,

08:09.489 --> 08:12.783
this place isn't as gentle as in the ring.

08:13.409 --> 08:17.622
We have no referee nor any rules
to help prevent danger.

08:18.247 --> 08:22.168
Then who will declare this fight as over?

08:22.251 --> 08:25.171
Baki, it has to come from your mouth.

08:25.254 --> 08:29.342
"Please forgive me, spare me."

08:29.884 --> 08:31.928
You have to say it.

08:33.804 --> 08:34.931
I guess so,

08:35.014 --> 08:36.933
but how can we end it now?

08:37.517 --> 08:40.937
We've passed the point of no return.

08:41.521 --> 08:44.482
How could rules and referees decide

08:44.565 --> 08:47.944
how to end a fight
with an opponent I hate this much?

08:48.528 --> 08:52.406
Either one of us has to die,
or admit their loss.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.450
There's no other way.

08:55.326 --> 08:56.911
In that case, Oliva,

08:57.495 --> 09:00.456
you clearly showed your weakness just now.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.251
Your words earlier…

09:03.334 --> 09:07.046
You want me to admit defeat.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.424
Even though I can't move right now,

09:10.508 --> 09:12.718
you're definitely closer to losing.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.726
Pac-Man!

09:22.645 --> 09:23.980
The ball is shrinking!

09:28.568 --> 09:30.736
Do you take me for a fool?

09:30.820 --> 09:34.365
Using the same move twice
on a first-class fighter?

09:43.833 --> 09:45.251
You damn brat.

09:45.334 --> 09:47.003
"You'll pay for this"?

09:47.086 --> 09:49.005
You'll pay for this!

09:49.589 --> 09:51.757
What more could we do to each other?

09:53.593 --> 09:54.885
Enough already.

09:55.469 --> 09:58.014
I'm done playing "my secret weapon."

09:58.889 --> 10:02.518
What's the point in winning
using cheap tricks?

10:02.602 --> 10:05.771
You think you can win with cheap tricks?

10:06.355 --> 10:08.024
It'd be a waste.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.819
That's not how you win

10:12.361 --> 10:15.906
against Biscuit Oliva,
the strongest man in America.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.536
Let's just beat each other up.

10:23.247 --> 10:26.167
I didn't understand
what he was saying either.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.919
The two of them were already
fighting each other.

10:29.837 --> 10:31.505
Face to face.

10:31.589 --> 10:34.175
Standing our ground like real men.

10:35.009 --> 10:37.178
I think Oliva had no choice but to laugh.

10:37.887 --> 10:41.515
After all,
a kid 100 kg lighter than himself,

10:41.599 --> 10:43.434
told him to "fight like a man."

10:43.517 --> 10:44.935
Damn kid!

10:45.519 --> 10:46.687
Then in that moment…

10:46.771 --> 10:47.938
No!

10:48.022 --> 10:50.274
Don't do it!

10:50.358 --> 10:54.445
It was none other than
the former heavy weight champion,

10:55.029 --> 10:56.864
Iron Michael, himself.

10:56.947 --> 10:58.449
You're gonna get killed, Baki!

10:59.158 --> 11:03.704
He'd been in one the rooms
Oliva had broken through.

11:04.288 --> 11:05.706
In cases like this,

11:05.790 --> 11:08.542
we're allowed to shoot without warning,
but…

11:09.043 --> 11:11.379
You're not thinking about weight class!

11:11.462 --> 11:15.216
Think about why boxing
has 17 weight classes!

11:15.299 --> 11:19.220
What he was saying made so much sense,
we couldn't help but listen.

11:19.303 --> 11:23.849
A middleweight like you
facing Mister is suicide!

11:23.933 --> 11:27.603
Even I wouldn't face Mister! I couldn't!

11:28.187 --> 11:29.397
Don't!

11:29.480 --> 11:30.856
I got it, Michael.

11:31.941 --> 11:32.858
I understand.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.779
That means it's totally worth trying!

11:40.074 --> 11:40.991
No one…

11:41.659 --> 11:43.494
can stop them anymore.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.371
Neither Michael,

11:45.996 --> 11:46.997
nor the rules.

11:47.581 --> 11:48.499
Most likely…

11:52.002 --> 11:54.255
This is the greatest fist fight

11:54.338 --> 11:56.340
since this planet came into existence.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.642
The end…

12:07.935 --> 12:08.769
must be near.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.200
What was the fight like?

12:23.284 --> 12:27.288
Well, I'm really sorry, but I don't know.

12:27.371 --> 12:28.289
"Why," you ask?

12:29.415 --> 12:32.585
None of the three of us could see.

12:32.668 --> 12:34.044
It was too fast.

12:35.087 --> 12:38.215
I heard later that around the same time,

12:39.633 --> 12:42.720
vultures lined along the outer wall.

12:46.223 --> 12:48.476
There's one thing I do know.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.645
I'm going to beat Oliva.

12:52.396 --> 12:53.522
Using…

12:54.106 --> 12:55.232
technique,

12:55.858 --> 12:57.026
using brains.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.528
No…

12:59.612 --> 13:01.655
neither sound right.

13:02.698 --> 13:05.159
That's not what it means to win.

13:05.242 --> 13:07.661
To beat Oliva,
who's 100 kg heavier than me,

13:08.245 --> 13:10.414
I have to do it with power.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.085
Head on.

13:16.253 --> 13:17.922
Only head on.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.174
I won't run.

13:20.257 --> 13:21.717
I'm going to force him…

13:25.513 --> 13:26.430
straight back!

13:27.389 --> 13:29.433
Straight into that wall beyond

13:29.517 --> 13:30.935
and beyond that wall.

13:32.311 --> 13:33.437
No one said anything,

13:34.188 --> 13:36.190
but we had all taken our caps off.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.527
They do exist, don't they? Men like that.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.446
They do happen, don't they?
Fights like that.

13:43.697 --> 13:46.450
Noble, sublime,

13:47.284 --> 13:48.202
and sacred.

13:51.038 --> 13:52.957
The kind
that makes you want to kneel down.

13:54.875 --> 13:59.463
This boy who is not even half my size,

13:59.547 --> 14:02.716
is now driving me back.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.636
No! He's not just driving me back.

14:05.719 --> 14:07.680
A boy 100 kg lighter than me…

14:08.681 --> 14:11.725
is driving me… driving America…

14:45.718 --> 14:48.053
It was a symbolic scene.

14:49.847 --> 14:53.392
When I came to and raised my head…

14:55.853 --> 14:59.148
no one was in front of me anymore.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.382
Contact the infirmary! Hurry!

15:25.466 --> 15:26.300
Yes, sir.

15:37.895 --> 15:38.812
What?

15:42.524 --> 15:43.651
M-Maria.

15:44.985 --> 15:47.446
You walked all the way here?

15:48.656 --> 15:51.075
You lost to that boy, didn't you?

15:53.369 --> 15:54.203
Yes.

15:56.121 --> 15:57.581
-Let's go back.
-Huh?

15:58.165 --> 16:00.042
I can't walk anymore.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.920
Coming here was the best I could do.

16:03.504 --> 16:06.548
Are you going to make that boy carry me?

16:11.345 --> 16:12.179
Of course not.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.683
I won't give that right to anyone.

16:21.605 --> 16:23.440
Call the director.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.859
I have something to announce
to all the prisoners.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.589
You're all sharp-eared gentlemen,

16:48.173 --> 16:50.843
I'm certain you've already heard
the rumors.

16:51.427 --> 16:52.970
The rumors are true.

16:53.053 --> 16:55.347
I lost to Baki Hanma.

16:58.434 --> 16:59.601
Therefore,

16:59.685 --> 17:04.857
I am no longer the strongest here
in Arizona State Prison.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.112
However,

17:11.238 --> 17:13.615
I can't stand for that.

17:15.701 --> 17:19.621
So what should I do? It's simple.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.124
This guy just needs to disappear.

17:25.210 --> 17:28.130
Chief, take care of it, will you?

17:28.839 --> 17:31.383
Baki Hanma is discharged as of today.

17:31.467 --> 17:32.718
Huh?

17:32.801 --> 17:36.513
Today may not be possible…

17:37.097 --> 17:39.308
The paperwork can be done later.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.602
Uh, well, that's…

17:42.853 --> 17:46.273
Better than 4,000 prisoners escaping,
right?

17:49.818 --> 17:51.111
It was surprising.

17:51.945 --> 17:55.199
It was really surprising
how easily I was discharged.

17:56.450 --> 18:00.120
All I asked for was one bicycle
and some food and water.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.747
And a little bit of cash.

18:02.706 --> 18:04.708
On the other hand, Mr. Unchained--

18:04.792 --> 18:07.169
Biscuit Oliva forced a condition on me.

18:09.755 --> 18:14.635
A helicopter to the airport
to guard me from above!

18:15.260 --> 18:16.428
It's so noisy!

18:31.735 --> 18:34.321
So he beat Unchained with force, huh?

18:35.614 --> 18:39.326
He's grown beyond your expectations,
hasn't he?

18:41.411 --> 18:43.330
You laughed,

18:44.164 --> 18:47.584
but the idea Baki racked his brain
to come up with--

18:48.252 --> 18:51.755
his imaginary fight against
the praying mantis as his enemy…

18:52.965 --> 18:56.510
I see it as an impressive counterattack

18:56.593 --> 18:59.763
against you who dared
to kill the giant African Elephant.

19:03.934 --> 19:06.854
I should add, "finally."

19:07.521 --> 19:12.860
He overpowered the strongest in America…
no, the world,

19:12.943 --> 19:16.113
"Unchained" Oliva.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.367
He was a monster even you acknowledged.

19:22.077 --> 19:23.370
Say, Ogre.

19:23.954 --> 19:29.376
Baki may be your greatest threat
on Earth now.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.629
You talk too much, Strydum.

19:34.214 --> 19:37.384
S-Sorry. I'll change the subject.

19:42.723 --> 19:45.767
In any case, what's surprising,

19:46.351 --> 19:49.605
is the fact that even if
these stuffed creatures were to be alive,

19:49.688 --> 19:52.524
they would never be able to beat you.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.276
Take this for example, Ogre,

19:54.359 --> 19:57.154
could Baki currently beat this guy?

19:58.655 --> 20:00.532
He probably wouldn't do it,

20:01.241 --> 20:02.659
but if he did, it'd be easy.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.914
Oh, yeah? Let's see…

20:08.498 --> 20:09.917
How about this one?

20:10.500 --> 20:11.543
He'd struggle.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.921
He wouldn't escape harmless,

20:14.004 --> 20:17.174
but I'd say it'd take
less than 30 minutes.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.426
T-Then how about…

20:19.509 --> 20:21.428
Enough already!

20:22.054 --> 20:24.431
You're not some kid at the toy store.

20:24.514 --> 20:26.934
Or do you want me to shut you up?

20:27.517 --> 20:29.311
S-Sorry about that.

20:29.811 --> 20:31.438
Don't take it personally.

20:32.022 --> 20:34.816
I got it. I won't ask anymore questions.

20:34.900 --> 20:35.943
Never again.

20:36.526 --> 20:39.863
It's just that you and your son

20:39.947 --> 20:42.991
are about to have
the world's greatest quarrel.

20:44.159 --> 20:46.495
And it's likely you are about

20:46.578 --> 20:49.831
to fight your strongest enemy
in your lifetime.

20:50.415 --> 20:53.418
Don't mock my curiosity.

20:55.963 --> 20:59.091
The strongest enemy in my lifetime, huh?

21:00.217 --> 21:02.844
Here's to filial piety.

21:05.555 --> 21:07.849
-Oh, um…
-Hm?

21:09.309 --> 21:11.603
Could you beat this one?

21:12.938 --> 21:14.106
You bastard…

21:16.984 --> 21:18.860
So, could you?

21:20.153 --> 21:20.988
Could you?

21:30.622 --> 21:33.792
United States of America.
Somewhere in the state of Colorado.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.670
The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant.

21:40.841 --> 21:42.801
701 meters underground,

21:42.884 --> 21:45.554
a rock salt layer 1,000 meters thick.

21:47.848 --> 21:52.686
A wall of clear salt formed
190 million years ago.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.522
The excavators stood still,

21:55.605 --> 21:59.735
unable to believe
what was in front their eyes.

22:02.070 --> 22:03.947
"This wasn't in the textbooks!"

23:46.174 --> 23:51.179
