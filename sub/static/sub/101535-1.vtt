01:12.489 --> 01:18.328
This city in Ukraine was once home
to almost 50,000 people.

01:18.912 --> 01:23.041
<i>It had everything a community would need</i>
<i>for a comfortable life.</i>

01:24.209 --> 01:26.628
[indistinct chatter]

01:26.711 --> 01:32.383
But on the 26th of April, 1986,
it suddenly became uninhabitable.

01:34.385 --> 01:38.681
<i>The nearby nuclear power station</i>
<i>of Chernobyl exploded.</i>

01:38.765 --> 01:41.643
[helicopter hovering]

01:42.644 --> 01:47.273
<i>And in less than 48 hours,</i>
<i>the city was evacuated.</i>

01:50.777 --> 01:52.987
<i>No one has lived here since.</i>

02:03.832 --> 02:10.213
The explosion was a result of bad planning
and human error. Mistakes.

02:11.381 --> 02:17.053
It triggered an environmental catastrophe
that had an impact across Europe.

02:17.971 --> 02:23.476
<i>Many people regarded it as the most costly</i>
<i>in the history of mankind.</i>

02:25.603 --> 02:28.940
But Chernobyl was a single event.

02:29.732 --> 02:34.112
The true tragedy of our time
is still unfolding across the globe,

02:34.195 --> 02:36.489
barely noticeable from day to day.

02:37.323 --> 02:41.161
I'm talking about
the loss of our planet's wild places,

02:41.244 --> 02:43.162
its biodiversity.

02:50.420 --> 02:54.340
<i>The living world is a unique</i>
<i>and spectacular marvel.</i>

02:55.884 --> 03:00.513
<i>Billions of individuals, and millions</i>
<i>of kinds of plants and animals...</i>

03:00.597 --> 03:01.472
[birds chirping]

03:01.556 --> 03:04.475
<i>...dazzling in their variety and richness.</i>

03:06.603 --> 03:10.523
<i>Working together to benefit</i>
<i>from the energy of the sun</i>

03:11.024 --> 03:13.151
<i>and the minerals of the earth.</i>

03:15.278 --> 03:20.700
<i>Leading lives that interlock in such a way</i>
<i>that they sustain each other.</i>

03:22.785 --> 03:28.166
<i>We rely entirely on this finely tuned</i>
<i>life-support machine.</i>

03:29.626 --> 03:34.464
<i>And it relies on its biodiversity</i>
<i>to run smoothly.</i>

03:39.719 --> 03:46.392
<i>Yet the way we humans live on Earth now</i>
<i>is sending biodiversity into a decline.</i>

03:46.476 --> 03:48.895
[leaves rustling]

03:51.940 --> 03:56.402
This too is happening as a result
of bad planning and human error

03:57.278 --> 04:01.157
and it too will lead
to what we see here.

04:04.410 --> 04:07.872
<i>A place in which we cannot live.</i>

04:12.585 --> 04:14.337
The natural world is fading.

04:14.420 --> 04:18.257
The evidence is all around.
It's happened in my lifetime.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.551
I've seen it with my own eyes.

04:21.219 --> 04:25.890
This film is my witness statement
and my vision for the future,

04:26.557 --> 04:30.270
the story of how we came to make this
our greatest mistake,

04:30.353 --> 04:34.774
and how, if we act now,
we can yet put it right.

04:52.417 --> 04:57.046
I am David Attenborough, and I am 93.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.550
I've had the most extraordinary life.

05:01.342 --> 05:05.096
It's only now that I appreciate
how extraordinary.

05:06.055 --> 05:08.349
[speaking indistinctly]

05:11.144 --> 05:13.104
[Attenborough] <i>I've been lucky enough</i>
<i>to spend my life</i>

05:13.187 --> 05:15.606
<i>exploring the wild places of our planet.</i>

05:18.735 --> 05:21.237
<i>I've traveled to every part of the globe.</i>

05:28.077 --> 05:33.916
<i>I've experienced the living world</i>
<i>firsthand in all its variety and wonder.</i>

05:36.836 --> 05:41.132
<i>In truth, I couldn't imagine</i>
<i>living my life in any other way.</i>

05:44.594 --> 05:49.640
<i>I've always had a passion to explore,</i>
<i>to have adventures,</i>

05:50.141 --> 05:52.769
<i>to learn about the wilds beyond.</i>

05:52.852 --> 05:54.395
[exclaiming in surprise]

05:54.479 --> 05:55.730
<i>And I'm still learning.</i>

05:56.689 --> 05:57.690
Boo!

05:57.774 --> 06:01.277
<i>As much now as I did when I was a boy.</i>

06:02.403 --> 06:04.113
[birds chirping]

06:18.878 --> 06:21.172
<i>It was a very different world back then.</i>

06:22.715 --> 06:27.345
<i>We had very little understanding</i>
<i>of how the living world actually worked.</i>

06:30.139 --> 06:32.767
<i>It was called natural history</i>

06:32.850 --> 06:35.728
<i>because that's essentially</i>
<i>what it was all about...</i>

06:37.188 --> 06:38.439
<i>history.</i>

06:42.276 --> 06:44.362
<i>It was a great place to come to as a boy,</i>

06:44.445 --> 06:49.742
because this is, um, ironstone workings,
but it was disused.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.828
All this was absolutely clear, it was...

06:51.911 --> 06:53.996
only just stopped being a working quarry.

07:07.718 --> 07:11.430
<i>When I was a boy,</i>
<i>I spent all my spare time</i>

07:11.514 --> 07:14.183
<i>searching through rocks</i>
<i>in places like this...</i>

07:15.601 --> 07:17.019
<i>for buried treasure.</i>

07:20.273 --> 07:21.107
Fossils.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.111
It's a creature called an ammonite.

07:25.194 --> 07:28.489
And in life the animal itself
lived in the chamber here

07:28.573 --> 07:31.659
and spread out its tentacles
to catch its prey.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.747
And it lived about 180 million years ago.

07:37.874 --> 07:42.462
This particular one
has a scientific name of <i>Tiltonicerus,</i>

07:42.545 --> 07:46.132
because the first one ever
was found near this quarry

07:46.215 --> 07:49.010
here in Tilton, in the middle of England.

07:50.428 --> 07:55.892
Over time, I began to learn something
about the earth's evolutionary history.

07:56.767 --> 08:00.897
By and large, it's a story of slow,
steady change.

08:03.566 --> 08:08.779
<i>Over billions of years,</i>
<i>nature has crafted miraculous forms,</i>

08:08.863 --> 08:12.992
<i>each more complex and accomplished</i>
<i>than the last.</i>

08:15.244 --> 08:18.706
<i>It's an achingly intricate labor.</i>

08:22.835 --> 08:26.297
<i>And then,</i>
<i>every hundred million years or so,</i>

08:26.380 --> 08:29.675
<i>after all those painstaking processes,</i>

08:29.759 --> 08:34.847
<i>something catastrophic happens,</i>
<i>a mass extinction.</i>

08:35.932 --> 08:41.562
Great numbers of species disappear
and are suddenly replaced by a few.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.942
<i>All that evolution undone.</i>

08:48.027 --> 08:51.572
<i>You can see it. A line in the rock layers.</i>

08:51.656 --> 08:56.410
<i>A boundary that marks a profound,</i>
<i>rapid, global change.</i>

08:57.161 --> 09:00.873
<i>Below the line</i>
<i>are a multitude of lifeforms.</i>

09:02.416 --> 09:04.418
<i>Above, very few.</i>

09:07.505 --> 09:13.219
A mass extinction has happened five times
in life's four-billion-year history.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.265
<i>The last time it happened</i>

09:17.348 --> 09:21.727
<i>was the event that brought the end</i>
<i>of the age of the dinosaurs.</i>

09:22.979 --> 09:26.607
<i>A meteorite impact triggered</i>
<i>a catastrophic change</i>

09:26.691 --> 09:28.818
<i>in the earth's conditions.</i>

09:31.529 --> 09:35.908
<i>75% of all species were wiped out.</i>

09:38.911 --> 09:42.832
<i>Life had no option but to rebuild.</i>

09:44.625 --> 09:50.214
<i>For 65 million years, it's been at work</i>
<i>reconstructing the living world...</i>

09:52.133 --> 09:57.555
<i>until we come to the world we know...</i>
<i>our time.</i>

10:05.396 --> 10:08.774
<i>Scientists call it the Holocene.</i>

10:14.280 --> 10:17.617
<i>The Holocene has been</i>
<i>one of the most stable periods</i>

10:17.700 --> 10:19.827
<i>in our planet's great history.</i>

10:19.910 --> 10:22.163
[birds chirping]

10:22.246 --> 10:27.627
<i>For 10,000 years, the average temperature</i>
<i>has not wavered up or down</i>

10:27.710 --> 10:29.920
<i>by more than one degree Celsius.</i>

10:33.924 --> 10:37.386
<i>And the rich and thriving</i>
<i>living world around us</i>

10:37.970 --> 10:40.514
<i>has been key to this stability.</i>

10:44.685 --> 10:51.108
<i>Phytoplankton at the ocean's surface</i>
<i>and immense forests straddling the north</i>

10:51.192 --> 10:56.238
<i>have helped to balance the atmosphere</i>
<i>by locking away carbon.</i>

10:59.158 --> 11:00.993
<i>Huge herds on the plains</i>

11:01.077 --> 11:06.248
<i>have kept the grasslands rich</i>
<i>and productive by fertilizing the soils.</i>

11:12.171 --> 11:15.966
<i>Mangroves and coral reefs</i>
<i>along thousands of miles of coast</i>

11:16.550 --> 11:19.053
<i>have harbored nurseries of fish species</i>

11:19.136 --> 11:23.766
<i>that, when mature,</i>
<i>then range into open waters.</i>

11:30.398 --> 11:35.361
<i>A thick belt of jungles around the equator</i>
<i>has piled plant on plant</i>

11:35.444 --> 11:38.656
<i>to capture as much of the sun's energy</i>
<i>as possible,</i>

11:39.240 --> 11:42.993
<i>adding moisture and oxygen</i>
<i>to the global air currents.</i>

11:47.331 --> 11:50.376
<i>And the extent of the polar ice</i>
<i>has been critical,</i>

11:50.459 --> 11:53.629
<i>reflecting sunlight</i>
<i>back off its white surface,</i>

11:54.338 --> 11:56.298
<i>cooling the whole earth.</i>

12:00.261 --> 12:05.015
<i>The biodiversity of the Holocene</i>
<i>helped to bring stability,</i>

12:06.142 --> 12:12.606
<i>and the entire living world settled</i>
<i>into a gentle, reliable rhythm...</i>

12:13.941 --> 12:15.443
<i>the seasons.</i>

12:23.200 --> 12:24.660
<i>On the tropical plains,</i>

12:24.743 --> 12:29.957
<i>the dry and rainy seasons would switch</i>
<i>every year like clockwork.</i>

12:33.711 --> 12:38.340
<i>In Asia, the winds would create</i>
<i>the monsoon on cue.</i>

12:38.424 --> 12:40.217
[thunder rumbling]

12:46.223 --> 12:51.604
<i>In the northern regions, the temperatures</i>
<i>would lift in March, triggering spring,</i>

12:52.771 --> 12:57.902
<i>and stay high until they dipped in October</i>
<i>and brought about autumn.</i>

12:57.985 --> 12:59.737
[birds chirping and chattering]

13:02.156 --> 13:05.868
The Holocene was our Garden of Eden.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.621
Its rhythm of seasons was so reliable

13:08.704 --> 13:12.374
that it gave our own species
a unique opportunity.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.002
[mooing]

13:15.085 --> 13:17.713
<i>We invented farming.</i>

13:20.633 --> 13:25.554
<i>We learnt how to exploit the seasons</i>
<i>to produce food crops.</i>

13:27.431 --> 13:31.477
<i>The history of</i>
<i>all human civilization followed.</i>

13:33.395 --> 13:37.107
<i>Each generation able</i>
<i>to develop and progress</i>

13:37.191 --> 13:40.694
<i>only because the living world</i>
<i>could be relied upon</i>

13:40.778 --> 13:43.239
<i>to deliver us the conditions we needed.</i>

13:46.575 --> 13:51.664
<i>The pace of progress was unlike anything</i>
<i>to be found in the fossil record.</i>

13:54.917 --> 13:59.463
Our intelligence changed the way
in which we evolved.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.549
In the past,

14:01.632 --> 14:07.721
animals had to develop some
physical ability to change their lives.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.809
But for us, an idea could do that.

14:11.892 --> 14:15.938
And the idea could be passed
from one generation to the next.

14:18.524 --> 14:22.069
<i>We were transforming</i>
<i>what a species could achieve.</i>

14:26.323 --> 14:32.580
A few millennia after this began,
I grew up at exactly the right moment.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.793
<i>The start of my career in my 20s</i>

14:37.877 --> 14:41.964
<i>coincided with the advent</i>
<i>of global air travel.</i>

14:43.507 --> 14:46.969
<i>So, I had the privilege of being</i>
<i>amongst the first</i>

14:47.052 --> 14:51.223
<i>to fully experience the bounty of life</i>
<i>that had come about</i>

14:51.307 --> 14:53.892
<i>as a result of</i>
<i>the Holocene's gentle climate.</i>

15:14.079 --> 15:17.541
<i>Wherever I went, there was wilderness.</i>

15:18.459 --> 15:20.794
<i>Sparkling coastal seas.</i>

15:21.920 --> 15:23.547
<i>Vast forests.</i>

15:25.132 --> 15:27.134
<i>Immense grasslands.</i>

15:27.217 --> 15:31.180
<i>You could fly for hours</i>
<i>over the untouched wilderness.</i>

15:33.933 --> 15:38.395
<i>And there I was, actually being asked</i>
<i>to explore these places</i>

15:38.479 --> 15:42.107
<i>and record the wonders</i>
<i>of the natural world for people back home.</i>

15:44.234 --> 15:45.736
And to begin with, it was quite easy.

15:45.819 --> 15:48.238
People had never seen pangolins
before on television.

15:48.322 --> 15:50.032
They'd never seen sloths before.

15:50.115 --> 15:52.326
They had never seen the center
of New Guinea before.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.376
<i>It was the best time of my life.</i>

16:01.627 --> 16:04.505
The best time of our lives.

16:05.214 --> 16:09.426
<i>The Second World War was over,</i>
<i>technology was making our lives easier.</i>

16:11.971 --> 16:15.724
<i>The pace of change</i>
<i>was getting faster and faster.</i>

16:16.475 --> 16:18.477
[indistinct chatter]

16:21.480 --> 16:24.650
[Attenborough] <i>It felt that nothing</i>
<i>would limit our progress.</i>

16:25.693 --> 16:28.779
<i>The future was going to be exciting.</i>

16:28.862 --> 16:31.824
<i>It was going to bring everything</i>
<i>we had ever dreamed of.</i>

16:34.910 --> 16:39.289
This was before any of us were aware
that there were problems.

16:52.886 --> 16:57.391
<i>My first visit to East Africa was in 1960.</i>

17:01.687 --> 17:06.900
<i>Back then, it seemed inconceivable</i>
<i>that we, a single species,</i>

17:06.984 --> 17:12.489
<i>might one day have the power to threaten</i>
<i>the very existence of the wilderness.</i>

17:16.076 --> 17:20.664
The Maasai word "Serengeti"
means "endless plains."

17:21.290 --> 17:24.001
To those who live here,
it's an apt description.

17:24.084 --> 17:26.754
You can be in one spot on the Serengeti,

17:26.837 --> 17:29.506
and the place is totally empty of animals,

17:29.590 --> 17:31.050
and then, the next morning...

17:31.133 --> 17:32.593
[bellowing]

17:32.676 --> 17:34.720
<i>...one million wildebeest.</i>

17:34.803 --> 17:37.890
[bellowing]

17:41.185 --> 17:43.437
<i>A quarter of a million zebra.</i>

17:43.520 --> 17:46.023
[snorting]

17:48.150 --> 17:49.943
<i>Half a million gazelle.</i>

17:53.030 --> 17:54.656
<i>A few days after that...</i>

17:55.991 --> 17:59.328
<i>and they're gone... over the horizon.</i>

17:59.411 --> 18:03.499
<i>You can be forgiven for thinking</i>
<i>that these plains are endless</i>

18:04.082 --> 18:06.293
when they could swallow up such a herd.

18:07.377 --> 18:08.962
<i>It took a visionary scientist,</i>

18:09.046 --> 18:12.716
<i>Bernhard Grzimek,</i>
<i>to explain that this wasn't true.</i>

18:16.011 --> 18:21.433
<i>He and his son used a plane</i>
<i>to follow the herds over the horizon.</i>

18:22.059 --> 18:24.436
[grunting]

18:31.610 --> 18:34.530
<i>They charted them</i>
<i>as they moved across rivers,</i>

18:34.613 --> 18:37.783
<i>through woodlands,</i>
<i>and over national borders.</i>

18:39.952 --> 18:42.371
<i>They discovered that the Serengeti herds</i>

18:42.454 --> 18:47.376
<i>required an enormous area</i>
<i>of healthy grassland to function.</i>

18:48.627 --> 18:52.965
<i>That without such an immense space,</i>
<i>the herds would diminish</i>

18:53.048 --> 18:57.010
<i>and the entire ecosystem</i>
<i>would come crashing down.</i>

18:58.804 --> 19:03.016
The point for me was simple:
the wild is far from unlimited.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.019
It's finite. It needs protecting.

19:06.520 --> 19:10.149
And a few years later,
that idea became obvious to everyone.

19:10.941 --> 19:16.488
[NASA technician] <i>Five, four,</i>
<i>three, two one, zero.</i>

19:18.448 --> 19:23.162

19:27.249 --> 19:28.625
<i>It was the first time</i>

<i>what we all saw.</i>

19:43.932 --> 19:48.854
<i>Our planet, vulnerable and isolated.</i>

19:54.902 --> 19:59.489
<i>One of the extraordinary things about it</i>
<i>was that the world</i>

19:59.573 --> 20:02.326
could actually watch it as it happened.

20:02.910 --> 20:09.041
It was extraordinary that you could see
what a man out in space could see

20:09.124 --> 20:11.210
as he saw it at the same time.

20:12.628 --> 20:16.840
And I remember very well that first shot.

20:17.341 --> 20:20.093
You saw a blue marble,

20:20.177 --> 20:26.642
a blue sphere in the blackness,
and you realized that that was the earth.

20:27.142 --> 20:31.104
And in that one shot, there was
the whole of humanity with nothing else

20:31.188 --> 20:35.734
except the person that was
in the spacecraft taking that picture.

20:36.735 --> 20:41.531
And that completely changed
the mindset of the population,

20:41.615 --> 20:43.242
the human population of the world.

20:46.870 --> 20:48.997
<i>Our home was not limitless.</i>

20:50.624 --> 20:53.252
<i>There was an edge to our existence.</i>

20:54.795 --> 20:59.049
It was a rediscovery
of a fundamental truth.

21:00.259 --> 21:04.346
We are ultimately bound by
and reliant upon

21:04.429 --> 21:07.641
the finite natural world about us.

21:09.559 --> 21:13.438
<i>This truth defined the life we led</i>
<i>in our pre-history,</i>

21:13.522 --> 21:17.067
<i>the time before farming and civilization.</i>

21:17.651 --> 21:20.862
<i>Even as some of us</i>
<i>were setting foot on the moon,</i>

21:20.946 --> 21:26.451
<i>others were still leading such a life</i>
<i>in the most remote parts of the planet.</i>

21:34.042 --> 21:40.090
<i>In 1971, I set out to find</i>
<i>an uncontacted tribe in New Guinea.</i>

21:43.719 --> 21:50.309
<i>These people were hunter-gatherers,</i>
<i>as all humankind had been before farming.</i>

21:51.518 --> 21:53.812
[speaking tribal language]

21:53.895 --> 21:57.691
[Attenborough] <i>They lived in small numbers</i>
<i>and didn't take too much.</i>

21:58.191 --> 22:02.029
[speaking tribal language]

22:02.112 --> 22:04.448
[Attenborough] <i>They ate meat rarely.</i>

22:05.365 --> 22:09.911
<i>The resources they used</i>
<i>naturally renewed themselves.</i>

22:10.871 --> 22:15.542
<i>Working with their traditional technology,</i>
<i>they were living sustainably,</i>

22:16.126 --> 22:20.005
<i>a lifestyle that could continue</i>
<i>effectively forever.</i>

22:20.797 --> 22:23.467
[speaking native language]

22:23.550 --> 22:26.303
[Attenborough] <i>It was a stark contrast</i>
<i>to the world I knew.</i>

22:27.471 --> 22:30.724
<i>A world that demanded more every day.</i>

22:40.734 --> 22:44.988
I spent the latter half of the 1970s
traveling the world,

22:45.072 --> 22:49.409
making a series I had long dreamed of
called <i>Life on Earth,</i>

22:50.577 --> 22:54.915
<i>the story of the evolution of life</i>
<i>and its diversity.</i>

22:56.708 --> 22:59.002
<i>It was shot in 39 countries.</i>

23:00.295 --> 23:03.673
<i>We filmed 650 species,</i>

23:03.757 --> 23:07.177
<i>and we traveled</i>
<i>one and a half million miles.</i>

23:07.844 --> 23:10.305
<i>That's the sort of commitment you need</i>

23:10.388 --> 23:14.309
<i>if you want to even begin</i>
<i>making a portrait of the living world.</i>

23:16.103 --> 23:17.395
But it was noticeable

23:17.479 --> 23:20.649
that some of these animals
were becoming harder to find.

23:36.748 --> 23:39.417
<i>When I filmed with the mountain gorillas,</i>

23:39.501 --> 23:44.506
<i>there were only 300 left</i>
<i>in a remote jungle in Central Africa.</i>

23:46.007 --> 23:48.426
Baby gorillas were at a premium,

23:48.510 --> 23:51.721
and poachers would kill
a dozen adults to get one.

23:53.473 --> 23:58.019
<i>I got as close as I did only because</i>
<i>the gorillas were used to people.</i>

24:00.313 --> 24:05.110
<i>The only way to keep them alive</i>
<i>was for rangers to be with them every day.</i>

24:11.366 --> 24:16.580
The process of extinction that I'd seen
as a boy... in the rocks,

24:17.581 --> 24:21.835
I now became aware was happening
right there around me

24:22.627 --> 24:25.046
to animals with which I was familiar.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.550
<i>Our closest relatives.</i>

24:32.095 --> 24:34.097
<i>And we were responsible.</i>

24:36.933 --> 24:39.477
<i>It revealed a cold reality.</i>

24:40.937 --> 24:43.064
Once a species became our target,

24:43.565 --> 24:47.068
there was now nowhere on earth
that it could hide.

24:59.748 --> 25:06.296
<i>Whales were being slaughtered by fleets</i>
<i>of industrial whaling ships in the 1970s.</i>

25:10.508 --> 25:13.678
<i>The largest whales, the blues,</i>

25:13.762 --> 25:16.389
<i>numbered only a few thousand by then.</i>

25:21.102 --> 25:23.730
<i>They were virtually impossible to find.</i>

25:26.858 --> 25:32.197
<i>We found humpbacks off Hawaii</i>
<i>only by listening out for their calls.</i>

25:32.781 --> 25:35.116
A moment ago, we made this recording

25:35.200 --> 25:39.120
with an underwater microphone
here in the Pacific near Hawaii.

25:39.204 --> 25:40.372
Just listen to this.

25:41.998 --> 25:45.794
[whales singing]

25:47.379 --> 25:49.381
[whales continue singing]

25:52.342 --> 25:56.304
<i>Recordings like these revealed</i>
<i>that the songs of the humpbacks</i>

25:56.388 --> 25:58.515
<i>are long and complex.</i>

25:59.849 --> 26:03.728
<i>Humpbacks living in the same area</i>
<i>learn their songs from each other.</i>

26:04.604 --> 26:10.277
<i>And the songs have distinct themes</i>
<i>and variations which evolve over time.</i>

26:10.360 --> 26:13.238
[whales singing]

26:19.327 --> 26:21.997
<i>Their mournful songs were the key</i>

26:22.080 --> 26:24.958
<i>to transforming people's opinions</i>
<i>about them.</i>

26:27.002 --> 26:28.628

26:29.462 --> 26:32.215
[protester in English] Hello, <i>Boctok.</i>
We are Canadian.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.593

Please stop killing the whales.

26:38.138 --> 26:40.473

<i>that had been viewed</i>

26:40.557 --> 26:43.768

26:49.024 --> 26:51.526
[protester over megaphone] We are men
and women, and we speak for children,

26:52.277 --> 26:56.489
and we're all saying,
"Please stop killing the whales."

26:58.533 --> 27:02.871
We have pursued animals to extinction
many times in our history,

27:03.747 --> 27:08.209
but now that it was visible,
it was no longer acceptable.

27:16.176 --> 27:20.680
<i>The killing of whales</i>
<i>turned from a harvest to a crime.</i>

27:22.599 --> 27:26.144
<i>A powerful shared conscience</i>
<i>had suddenly appeared.</i>

27:27.145 --> 27:30.690
Nobody wanted animals to become extinct.

27:32.150 --> 27:35.028
People were coming to care
for the natural world...

27:36.029 --> 27:39.657
<i>as they were made aware</i>
<i>of the natural world.</i>

27:42.702 --> 27:47.290
And we now had the means to make
people across the world aware.

[Attenborough] <i>By the time</i> Life on Earth

It's all happened
within the last 2,000 years or so.

28:30.625 --> 28:35.004
We seem to have broken loose
from the restrictions

28:35.088 --> 28:39.008

28:46.808 --> 28:48.560
[Attenborough] <i>We had broken loose.</i>

28:49.519 --> 28:53.189
<i>We were apart</i>

29:00.989 --> 29:03.783
<i>Our predators had been eliminated.</i>

29:06.453 --> 29:09.289
<i>Most of our diseases were under control.</i>

29:11.207 --> 29:14.753
<i>We had worked out</i>
<i>how to produce food to order.</i>

29:17.130 --> 29:20.383
There was nothing left to restrict us.

29:21.176 --> 29:23.136
Nothing to stop us.

29:24.387 --> 29:26.431
Unless we stopped ourselves...

29:27.557 --> 29:32.187
<i>we would keep consuming the earth</i>

29:35.106 --> 29:38.693
Saving individual species

32:25.652 --> 32:27.070
<i>Without this training,</i>

<i>The future generations</i>
<i>of many tree species would be at risk.</i>

32:37.789 --> 32:42.335
<i>And tree diversity is the key</i>
<i>to a rainforest.</i>

32:42.418 --> 32:46.005
[birds chirping]

32:46.089 --> 32:49.050
<i>In a single small patch</i>
<i>of tropical rainforest,</i>

32:49.133 --> 32:52.345
<i>there could be</i>
<i>700 different species of tree,</i>

But if you get in a helicopter,

33:29.424 --> 33:32.760
you see that
that is a strip about half a mile wide.

33:33.594 --> 33:35.221
And beyond that strip,

33:35.304 --> 33:40.560
<i>there is nothing but regimented rows</i>
<i>of oil palms.</i>

33:49.652 --> 33:53.531
<i>There is a double incentive</i>

33:55.491 --> 33:57.243
<i>People benefit from the timber...</i>

33:57.827 --> 34:02.123

34:03.249 --> 34:05.585
[chainsaw revs]

34:15.845 --> 34:21.476

34:35.656 --> 34:37.241
<i>What we see happening today</i>

<i>is just the latest chapter</i>

34:48.753 --> 34:53.716
<i>The deforestation of Borneo</i>
<i>has reduced the population of orangutan</i>

35:06.437 --> 35:09.190
We can't cut down rainforests forever,

and anything that we can't do forever is
by definition unsustainable.

35:15.113 --> 35:18.074
<i>If we do things that are unsustainable,</i>

35:18.157 --> 35:24.205
<i>the damage accumulates ultimately to</i>
<i>a point where the whole system collapses.</i>

35:25.665 --> 35:29.585
No ecosystem,

35:32.046 --> 35:35.216
<i>Even one as vast as the ocean.</i>

35:39.971 --> 35:44.559
<i>This habitat was the subject</i>
<i>of the series</i> The Blue Planet,

35:44.642 --> 35:47.270
<i>which we were filming in the late '90s.</i>

36:01.200 --> 36:06.664
It was... an astonishing vision
of a completely unknown world,

36:06.747 --> 36:10.877
a world that had existed
since the beginning of time.

36:18.968 --> 36:22.388
All sorts of things that you had no idea
had ever existed,

36:22.471 --> 36:26.767
all in a multitude of colors,
all unbelievably beautiful.

36:30.771 --> 36:35.568
<i>And all of them completely undisturbed</i>
<i>by your presence.</i>

36:43.784 --> 36:47.872
<i>For much of its expanse,</i>
<i>the ocean is largely empty.</i>

36:49.790 --> 36:53.127
<i>But in certain places, there are hot spots</i>

36:53.211 --> 36:55.922
<i>where currents bring nutrients</i>
<i>to the surface</i>

36:56.005 --> 36:59.258
<i>and trigger an explosion of life.</i>

37:05.097 --> 37:09.101
<i>In such places,</i>
<i>huge shoals of fish gather.</i>

37:17.276 --> 37:19.779
<i>The problem is that our fishing fleets</i>

37:19.862 --> 37:24.116
<i>are just as good at finding</i>
<i>those hot spots as are the fish.</i>

37:25.993 --> 37:31.457
<i>When they do, they're able to gather</i>
<i>the concentrated shoals with ease.</i>

37:35.461 --> 37:38.756
<i>It was only in the '50s that large fleets</i>

37:38.839 --> 37:42.301
<i>first ventured out</i>
<i>into international waters...</i>

37:43.177 --> 37:46.806
<i>to reap the open ocean harvest</i>
<i>across the globe.</i>

37:49.058 --> 37:53.896
<i>Yet, they've removed</i>
<i>90% of the large fish in the sea.</i>

38:01.654 --> 38:05.199
<i>At first, they caught</i>
<i>plenty of fish in their nets.</i>

38:06.450 --> 38:09.078
<i>But within only a few years,</i>

38:09.161 --> 38:13.457
<i>the nets across the globe</i>
<i>were coming in empty.</i>

38:15.126 --> 38:17.962
The fishing quickly became so poor

38:18.462 --> 38:23.050
that countries began to subsidize
the fleets to maintain the industry.

38:28.180 --> 38:31.726
<i>Without large fish</i>
<i>and other marine predators,</i>

38:31.809 --> 38:35.062
<i>the oceanic nutrient cycle stutters.</i>

38:41.861 --> 38:46.532
<i>The predators help to keep nutrients</i>
<i>in the ocean's sunlit waters,</i>

38:46.615 --> 38:51.245
<i>recycling them so that they can be used</i>
<i>again and again by plankton.</i>

38:56.042 --> 38:57.335
<i>Without predators,</i>

38:57.418 --> 39:00.629
<i>nutrients are lost for centuries</i>
<i>to the depths</i>

39:00.713 --> 39:03.924
<i>and the hot spots start to diminish.</i>

39:05.092 --> 39:07.595
The ocean starts to die.

39:13.017 --> 39:17.480
<i>Ocean life was also</i>
<i>unravelling in the shallows.</i>

39:23.027 --> 39:26.405
<i>In 1998, a </i>Blue Planet <i>film crew</i>

39:26.489 --> 39:29.825
<i>stumbled on an event</i>
<i>little known at the time.</i>

39:33.496 --> 39:36.832
<i>Coral reefs were turning white.</i>

39:41.170 --> 39:45.383
<i>The white color is caused</i>
<i>by corals expelling algae</i>

39:45.466 --> 39:48.552
<i>that lives symbiotically</i>
<i>within their body.</i>

39:55.768 --> 39:57.269
When you first see it,

39:57.353 --> 40:01.482
you think perhaps that it's beautiful,
and suddenly you realize it's tragic.

40:02.108 --> 40:04.819
Because what you're looking at
is skeletons.

40:04.902 --> 40:07.321
<i>Skeletons of dead creatures.</i>

40:15.121 --> 40:19.083
<i>The white corals are ultimately</i>
<i>smothered by seaweed.</i>

40:19.750 --> 40:25.423
<i>And the reef turns from wonderland...</i>
<i>to wasteland.</i>

40:30.344 --> 40:33.722
<i>At first, the cause of the bleaching</i>
<i>was a mystery.</i>

40:33.806 --> 40:38.519
<i>But scientists started to discover that</i>
<i>in many cases where bleaching occurred,</i>

40:39.103 --> 40:41.105
<i>the ocean was warming.</i>

40:42.106 --> 40:43.107
<i>For some time,</i>

40:43.190 --> 40:46.735
<i>climate scientists had warned</i>
<i>that the planet would get warmer</i>

40:46.819 --> 40:50.823
<i>as we burned fossil fuels</i>
<i>and released carbon dioxide</i>

40:50.906 --> 40:54.285
<i>and other greenhouse gasses</i>
<i>into the atmosphere.</i>

40:57.788 --> 41:00.040
<i>A marked change in atmospheric carbon</i>

41:00.124 --> 41:03.669

<i>In previous events,</i>

41:14.471 --> 41:19.226

<i>up to one million years</i>

41:19.310 --> 41:22.104
<i>to dredge up enough carbon</i>
<i>from within the earth </i>

41:22.188 --> 41:24.064
<i>to trigger a catastrophe.</i>

41:39.288 --> 41:43.709
The global air temperature had been
relatively stable till the '90s.

41:44.210 --> 41:47.254
But it now appeared this was
only because the ocean

41:47.338 --> 41:52.009

41:55.304 --> 41:57.473
<i>It was the first indication to me</i>

42:51.986 --> 42:56.991
<i>In my time, I've experienced</i>
<i>the warming of Arctic summers.</i>

42:59.660 --> 43:01.704
<i>We have arrived at locations</i>

43:01.787 --> 43:05.916

<i>and found none.</i>

43:09.128 --> 43:11.046
<i>We've managed to travel by boat</i>

By the time <i>Frozen Planet</i> aired in 2011,

was well established.

43:33.819 --> 43:37.448
<i>The ocean has long since</i>
<i>become unable to absorb</i>

43:37.531 --> 43:41.702

<i>caused by our activities.</i>

43:42.578 --> 43:45.831
As a result, the average

<i>By damming, polluting,</i>
<i>and over-extracting rivers and lakes,</i>

<i>we've reduced the size</i>
<i>of freshwater populations by over 80%.</i>

45:37.860 --> 45:41.488
We're replacing the wild with the tame.

45:45.784 --> 45:50.998
<i>Half of the fertile land on earth</i>

45:57.588 --> 46:03.260
<i>70% of the mass of birds</i>
<i>on this planet are domestic birds.</i>

46:03.844 --> 46:06.763
<i>The vast majority, chickens.</i>

<i>We account for over one-third</i>
<i>of the weight of mammals on earth.</i>

46:16.899 --> 46:21.111
<i>A further 60% are the animals</i>
<i>we raise to eat.</i>

46:34.917 --> 46:37.669
This is now our planet,

run by humankind for humankind.

46:41.131 --> 46:44.718
There is little left
for the rest of the living world.

<i>Since I started filming in the 1950s,</i>

46:54.269 --> 46:59.858
<i>on average, wild animal populations</i>
<i>have more than halved.</i>

47:02.653 --> 47:05.989

47:27.261 --> 47:30.264
Um, so, the world
is not as wild as it was.

47:31.598 --> 47:35.060
Well, we've destroyed it.
Not just ruined it.

47:35.143 --> 47:39.481

48:49.635 --> 48:53.764
the damage that has been
the defining feature of my lifetime

48:53.847 --> 48:58.268
will be eclipsed by the damage

49:09.946 --> 49:14.534
Science predicts that were I born today,

49:15.118 --> 49:17.829

49:22.834 --> 49:29.091
<i>The Amazon Rainforest, cut down until</i>
<i>it can no longer produce enough moisture,</i>

<i>and altering the global water cycle.</i>

49:47.067 --> 49:51.947

52:38.488 --> 52:40.907
Our greatest threat in thousands of years.

52:41.908 --> 52:43.493
If we don't take action,

52:44.077 --> 52:46.580
the collapse of our civilizations

52:47.330 --> 52:52.794
and the extinction of much of
the natural world is on the horizon.

52:53.461 --> 52:55.088
But the longer we leave it,

52:55.589 --> 52:59.092

1:02:36.878 --> 1:02:40.256
<i>Fishing is world's greatest wild harvest.</i>

1:02:40.339 --> 1:02:43.634

1:02:49.098 --> 1:02:51.142
<i>The healthier the marine habitat,</i>

1:02:51.225 --> 1:02:55.188

1:03:02.653 --> 1:03:06.365
<i>Palau is a Pacific Island nation</i>

1:03:15.500 --> 1:03:17.835
<i>When fish stocks began to reduce,</i>

1:03:17.919 --> 1:03:22.089
<i>the Palauans responded</i>
<i>by restricting fishing practices</i>

1:03:22.173 --> 1:03:26.010

1:03:29.263 --> 1:03:33.059
<i>Protected fish populations</i>

<i>As a result,</i>

1:03:43.444 --> 1:03:47.698

1:03:56.832 --> 1:04:01.462

<i>a similar approach across the world.</i>

1:04:02.505 --> 1:04:07.635
<i>Estimates suggest that "no fish" zones</i>
<i>over a third of our coastal seas</i>

<i>When it comes to the land,</i>

1:05:04.609 --> 1:05:08.279
we must radically reduce the area

1:05:08.362 --> 1:05:11.198
so that we can make space
for returning wilderness.

1:05:11.282 --> 1:05:16.329
And the quickest and most effective way

The planet can't support

And because we would be
then dedicated to raising plants,

1:06:23.229 --> 1:06:27.024
we could increase the yield
of this land substantially.

1:06:32.863 --> 1:06:37.952
<i>The Netherlands is one of the world's</i>

1:07:30.796 --> 1:07:36.761
It's entirely possible for us to apply

<i>Even in places</i>
<i>where there's no land at all.</i>

1:08:12.087 --> 1:08:14.548
<i>As we improve our approach to farming,</i>

1:08:14.632 --> 1:08:18.761
we'll start to reverse the land-grab
that we've been pursuing

1:08:18.844 --> 1:08:20.930
ever since we began to farm,

1:08:21.639 --> 1:08:27.728
which is essential because we have
an urgent need for all that free land.

1:08:34.944 --> 1:08:39.990
<i>Forests are a fundamental component</i>

1:08:41.617 --> 1:08:46.330

<i>And they are centers of biodiversity.</i>

1:08:55.172 --> 1:08:58.175
<i>Again, the two features work together.</i>

1:08:58.717 --> 1:09:01.804

We must immediately

1:09:13.649 --> 1:09:20.322
<i>and grow crops like oil palm and soya</i>

<i>After all, there's plenty of it.</i>

1:09:26.287 --> 1:09:28.414
But we can do better than that.

1:09:32.042 --> 1:09:37.756

1:10:25.804 --> 1:10:28.140
The return of the trees would absorb

1:10:28.224 --> 1:10:31.310
as much as two thirds
of the carbon emissions

1:10:31.393 --> 1:10:35.522

<i>With all these things,</i>

1:10:45.407 --> 1:10:48.077

<i>Nature is our biggest ally</i>
<i>and our greatest inspiration.</i>

When you think about it,
we're completing a journey.

1:12:14.913 --> 1:12:18.000
Ten thousand years ago,
as hunter-gatherers,

1:12:18.709 --> 1:12:23.047
we lived a sustainable life
because that was the only option.

1:12:24.089 --> 1:12:29.553
All these years later,
it's once again the only option.

1:12:29.636 --> 1:12:31.930
We need to rediscover...

1:12:33.015 --> 1:12:34.641
how to be sustainable.

1:12:34.725 --> 1:12:38.645
To move from being apart from nature

1:12:38.729 --> 1:12:43.317
to becoming a part of nature once again.

<i>In this future,</i>

There are many differences between humans
and the rest of the species on earth,

1:16:12.484 --> 1:16:17.781
but one that has been expressed is that
we alone are able to imagine the future.

For a long time, I and perhaps you
have dreaded that future.

1:16:24.079 --> 1:16:28.667
But it's now becoming apparent
that it's not all doom and gloom.

1:16:29.751 --> 1:16:32.170
There's a chance for us to make amends,

manage our impact,

1:16:36.717 --> 1:16:41.388
