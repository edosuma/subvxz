WEBVTT

00:30.931 --> 00:32.333
Shit.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.741
Son of a bitch.

01:15.709 --> 01:21.649
Where the fuck is it?

01:21.715 --> 01:24.185
**

01:42.936 --> 01:45.673
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

01:45.739 --> 01:47.908
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

01:47.975 --> 01:50.944
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

01:51.011 --> 01:53.347
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

01:53.414 --> 01:56.417
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

01:56.484 --> 01:58.652
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

01:58.719 --> 02:02.022
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

02:02.089 --> 02:03.324
* I can't let go *

02:15.903 --> 02:17.871
* I feel *

02:26.247 --> 02:27.748
- Harry.
- Are you close?

02:27.815 --> 02:29.917
I'm on my over to Narcotics
to talk to Ferras

02:29.983 --> 02:32.220
and see if they got anything
on Meadows.

02:32.286 --> 02:34.021
I'm running late.
Tanya's sick.

02:34.087 --> 02:35.889
I'm about to pick up the boys
and take them to school.

02:35.956 --> 02:37.057
Okay. Don't sweat it.

02:37.124 --> 02:38.192
Catch you later.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.760
All right.

02:39.827 --> 02:40.861
Help me out here.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.397
You have a report number?

02:43.464 --> 02:44.932
I was hoping you would
do this off the books.

02:44.998 --> 02:48.436
Why would I do that?
You got the serial number.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.604
And I'm gonna track it
with the manufacturer,

02:50.671 --> 02:52.906
see if I can identify
a point of sale.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.642
But I need it dusted.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.511
Where'd this little cutie
come from?

02:57.578 --> 02:59.913
Hey, you know what,
don't even tell me.

02:59.980 --> 03:02.049
I promise, it won't come back
to bite you in the ass.

03:02.115 --> 03:04.452
If there are any prints,
you won't be able to use them.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.453
I know.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.721
Give me a few weeks.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.089
How about a week?

03:09.156 --> 03:10.258
How about go fuck
yourself, Edgar?

03:10.324 --> 03:11.325
All right, thanks, Miguel.

03:11.392 --> 03:12.560
- I appreciate it.
- Yep.

03:12.626 --> 03:13.594
All right.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.305
He was parked there
for months.

03:24.372 --> 03:26.374
Slinging dope?

03:26.440 --> 03:28.642
No, from what I could tell,
just a user.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.378
When he first showed up
on Heliotrope,

03:30.444 --> 03:32.980
I booked him on
a G of chiva.

03:33.046 --> 03:36.850
- Didn't see that on his rap.
- He's a Vet.

03:36.917 --> 03:37.885
Cut him a break.

03:37.951 --> 03:40.721
Noble. He snitch for you?

03:40.788 --> 03:42.323
From time to time.

03:42.390 --> 03:45.125
- Nothing much.
- Did ya get to know him?

03:45.192 --> 03:47.661
Some. A bitter motherfucker.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.363
About the war.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.164
How the Army fucked him over.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.767
And how his so-called brothers
turned their backs.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.269
He was pretty rabid
about that shit.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.771
- Names?
- Naw.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.707
Ever say how they
fucked him over?

03:59.773 --> 04:02.476
Just that they fucked him
outta what he had coming.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.111
And they were gonna get theirs.

04:04.177 --> 04:06.514
Thanks.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.784
Your brother, Edward Gunn.

04:10.851 --> 04:13.521
My brother was
a solid gold asshole.

04:13.587 --> 04:17.591
But rape? Murder?

04:17.658 --> 04:20.294
What about the arrest?

04:20.361 --> 04:22.863
Harassment,
plain and simple.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.232
My brother was involved
with that girl.

04:25.299 --> 04:29.303
That was not a rape situation.
Eddie wasn't gonna hurt her.

04:29.370 --> 04:32.606
Bosch just busted in there,
he broke down the goddamn door.

04:32.673 --> 04:36.877
Your brother had clothesline
and duct tape with him
at the time.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.879
He was a housepainter.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.314
Tools of his trade.

04:40.381 --> 04:43.751
The girl didn't ever
press charges, did she?

04:43.817 --> 04:45.786
Bosch misunderstood
the whole thing.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.890
No choirboy, your brother.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.291
Yeah, he drank.

04:51.359 --> 04:52.693
I washed my hands.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.529
But still.

04:55.596 --> 04:58.599
And who showed up
every time he got busted?

04:58.666 --> 05:02.035
Trying to get Eddie to confess
to what he ain't done?

05:02.102 --> 05:03.537
Bosch.

05:03.604 --> 05:06.039
He made my brother's life
a living hell.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.845
I found these
in a closet upstairs.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.480
Photographs.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.982
I was keeping them
for George to show his kids.

06:24.351 --> 06:27.120
How've you been, Connie?

06:27.187 --> 06:28.922
Good days, bad days.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.591
You know.

06:31.459 --> 06:32.826
How's the new place?

06:32.893 --> 06:34.394
I love it.

06:34.462 --> 06:36.930
Ten minutes to campus.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.932
Those 20th Street
Craftsman bungalows.

06:38.999 --> 06:42.069
- Um-hmm.
- Near where I came up.

06:42.135 --> 06:44.672
I went through, and kept
a few things for myself,

06:44.738 --> 06:47.508
but nothing that
I thought you might like.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.643
Thank you.

06:49.710 --> 06:54.114
So, just take what you--
what you want.

06:55.483 --> 06:56.950
I'll take it all.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.057
Connie, I, um--

07:05.726 --> 07:08.361
I'm thinking about relocating.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.498
Taking another job.

07:11.632 --> 07:14.502
This city is in your pores.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.036
You'll never scrub it out.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.414
What'd Ferras have to say?

07:27.481 --> 07:29.149
Nothing on the dope angle.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.184
Meadows mighta had
a falling out with
his Army buddies.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.820
Swore he'd get back at them.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.755
Bad blood, it's a motive.

07:34.822 --> 07:35.589
Names?

07:35.656 --> 07:37.691
None whatsoever.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.159
Anything on street video?

07:39.226 --> 07:40.694
Cameras on the back block
were busted.

07:40.761 --> 07:44.097
So no video.
But, I did find this.

07:44.164 --> 07:46.767
Meadows' unit had
a Facebook page.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.007
Now that's a recruiting poster.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.208
Be all you can be.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.777
Where is that?

07:56.844 --> 07:58.245
Iraq, it looks like.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.980
And that's a lotta cash.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.149
Baksheesh.

08:02.215 --> 08:03.517
Bribes for locals.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.052
Our tax dollars at work.

08:07.655 --> 08:11.058
- And who's this?
- Captain Trevor Dobbs.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.526
Meadows' team leader.

08:12.593 --> 08:15.095
Owns and operates
Comprehensive Solutions,

08:15.162 --> 08:17.698
a personal security
consulting firm out in Encino.

08:17.765 --> 08:20.768
Let's say we go chat him up.

08:20.834 --> 08:21.835
I can't.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.403
Waiting on a callback
from St. Louis

08:23.470 --> 08:25.038
on Meadows' military records.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.941
I figured I'd run
these names down,

08:28.008 --> 08:29.943
and see if any of 'em
are local.

08:30.010 --> 08:33.146
Knock yourself out.
I'll let you know how it goes.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.153
I don't see the point.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.555
The point of the motion
is to introduce

08:41.622 --> 08:43.256
the wrongful death suit.

08:43.323 --> 08:46.426
Jury came back with
a whopping one dollar
in damages.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.228
Basically said it was
a good shooting,

08:48.295 --> 08:50.698
he just didn't follow
all the rules and regs.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.566
He was accused
of planting a gun, Rudy.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.401
Accused, not proven.

08:54.467 --> 08:55.502
What's the difference?

08:55.569 --> 08:56.970
As soon as
it's introduced,

08:57.037 --> 08:58.872
it's a skunk
in the jury box.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.608
The recent Allen case?

09:00.674 --> 09:03.076
As a witness,
Bosch is already junk bonds.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.012
This would seal the deal,
my friend.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.280
If the judge grants
the motion.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.416
It's certainly worth
a try.

09:09.482 --> 09:10.851
You're the lawyer.

09:10.918 --> 09:13.453
Let's talk about
our other little problem.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.889
Miss Annabelle Crowe.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.661
Better if she didn't
testify, at all.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.295
Rudy...

09:22.362 --> 09:25.699
I was thinking more along
the lines of inducements.

09:25.766 --> 09:29.502
Jay, I wasn't suggesting
long-term parking.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.539
All I'm saying is,
we have options.

09:32.606 --> 09:35.308
Ways of getting
Miss Crowe on board.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.645
She's a party girl.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.512
Let's find something.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.548
By all means.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.183
Let's bring her
the fuck on board.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.338
Trevor Dobbs?

10:05.405 --> 10:07.340
Yes, sir.
Can I help you?

10:07.407 --> 10:09.476
Detective Bosch, LAPD.

10:09.542 --> 10:12.445
I'd like to ask you some
questions about William Meadows.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.181
Billy?

10:14.247 --> 10:16.349
Is he all right?

10:16.416 --> 10:18.351
You haven't heard?

10:18.418 --> 10:19.720
No.

10:19.787 --> 10:21.021
Well, I'm sorry
to tell you.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.723
He was murdered last week.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.895
Ah, shit.

10:30.097 --> 10:32.666
Let's, uh--
Let's go inside.

10:35.435 --> 10:38.906
I didn't see anything in
the news or in the papers.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.808
It was reported as a John Doe.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.776
Homeless man in Hollywood.

10:42.843 --> 10:47.180
Took a few days
to make an ID.

10:47.247 --> 10:50.350
Some people don't get obits,
do they?

10:50.417 --> 10:52.185
No, they don't.

10:52.252 --> 10:53.553
Billy deserved one.

10:53.620 --> 10:55.222
He served his country.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.658
Goddamn.

10:58.726 --> 10:59.993
It's a shame.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.501
This you?

11:08.568 --> 11:11.504
Yep. And most of my team.

11:11.571 --> 11:12.840
Iraq.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.107
Anbar Province.

11:14.174 --> 11:14.708
Near Ramadi.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.710
Special Forces.

11:16.777 --> 11:17.945
How did you know?

11:18.011 --> 11:19.379
Meadows had the tattoo.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.348
You recognize it.

11:21.414 --> 11:22.750
I was Fifth group.

11:22.816 --> 11:25.252
ODA three-nine-nine-two.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.222
So Meadow's mother said he

11:29.289 --> 11:31.458
also did two tours
in Afghanistan.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.526
Yeah...

11:33.593 --> 11:36.096
night recons started
to freak him out.

11:36.163 --> 11:38.265
He had to get high
just to go on patrol.

11:38.331 --> 11:39.733
I can understand that.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.034
Yeah, it wears on you.

11:41.101 --> 11:43.470
You're out there--
pitch black.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.839
You get separated
from your unit--

11:45.906 --> 11:47.107
Feels like the sound
of your own

11:47.174 --> 11:48.408
breathing's gonna
give you away.

11:48.475 --> 11:49.442
Right.

11:49.509 --> 11:50.944
The Black Echo.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.647
So, you know.

11:54.714 --> 11:58.786
You also know,
some soldiers weather
the storm better than others.

11:58.852 --> 11:59.920
And when he came back?

11:59.987 --> 12:02.622
Billy had problems.

12:02.689 --> 12:05.258
With drugs,
problems with the law,

12:05.325 --> 12:08.595
arrests,
in and out of fucking rehab.

12:08.661 --> 12:10.097
Loaned him money.

12:10.163 --> 12:13.233
Aw, shit,
I gave him money.

12:13.300 --> 12:17.771
Couple years ago,
he was in real dire straits.

12:17.838 --> 12:20.974
So, ah, I took him
to Charlie Company.

12:21.041 --> 12:24.344
- How'd that work out?
- It didn't.

12:27.981 --> 12:30.083
Looks like you weathered
it all right.

12:30.150 --> 12:34.421
I'm one of the lucky ones.

12:34.487 --> 12:35.588
Shit.

12:35.655 --> 12:37.324
Started a family,
a business.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.526
Comprehensive Solutions.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.627
Security consulting.

12:40.693 --> 12:42.595
I've done well.

12:42.662 --> 12:44.264
Meadows ever work for you?

12:44.331 --> 12:45.866
No, he couldn't pass
the physical.

12:45.933 --> 12:48.869
The kind of work
that we do...

12:48.936 --> 12:51.371
It's not monitoring
residential burglar alarms.

12:51.438 --> 12:55.308
So you're talking contracting,
like Blackwater?

12:57.210 --> 13:00.013
Unless you have sky-high
security clearance, Detective,

13:00.080 --> 13:02.515
I can't talk about it.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.151
Absolutely.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.556
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

13:09.622 --> 13:10.991
I'll see myself out.

13:39.452 --> 13:42.222
I know we're supposed
to cooperate with you people,

13:42.289 --> 13:44.524
but half the time
you got your wires crossed.

13:44.591 --> 13:47.961
And it puts our clients off
if we're talking to the cops.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.063
I could always get a warrant.

13:50.130 --> 13:53.500
Oh, now you're gonna
strong arm me, huh?

13:53.566 --> 13:55.035
Only if I have to.

13:55.102 --> 13:57.070
You ever serve, Detective?

13:57.137 --> 13:58.906
- I did in fact.
- Where?

13:58.972 --> 14:00.273
Desert Storm.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.409
A tour in Afghanistan
after 9-11.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.016
Helen Archer.

14:09.082 --> 14:11.952
She got as close to
Billy Meadows as anybody.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.486
Girlfriend close?

14:13.553 --> 14:17.557
Don't think so.
She was more drink than drugs.

14:17.624 --> 14:21.194
But they were both
early on in Iraq.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.696
Caught the really crazy shit.

14:23.763 --> 14:27.600
Common ground, you know.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.402
That's where she works.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.804
If she wants you to know more
than that, that's up to her.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.441
Still like to see his file.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.979
For that, you are gonna
need a warrant.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.048
Roger that.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.154
Edgar.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.056
I'm trying
to reach Detective Bosch?

14:49.122 --> 14:51.191
He's not here right now.
Can I take a message?

14:51.258 --> 14:53.126
- You still his partner?
- I am.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.963
This is Scott Anderson.
I write for the Times.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.297
I know who you are.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.799
I'm about to post
a piece on Edward Gunn.

14:59.866 --> 15:01.468
We're not working that case.

15:01.534 --> 15:04.537
- Detectives Robertson
and Pierce are.
- I know.

15:04.604 --> 15:08.976
I was just wondering
if Detective Bosch
would care to comment.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.544
Now that Gunn is dead,
how does he feel?

15:11.611 --> 15:14.914
I really think you should speak
to media relations.

15:14.982 --> 15:17.517
You're his partner.
You know him better
than anyone.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.886
After pursuing Gunn
for so long,

15:19.953 --> 15:21.654
is he disappointed?

15:21.721 --> 15:23.923
Frustrated? Angry?

15:23.991 --> 15:27.961
Look, he's working.
And so am I.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.030
Tell him my deadline's tonight.

15:40.907 --> 15:41.774
What?

15:41.841 --> 15:43.276
Nothing.

15:57.090 --> 16:00.027
You have plans
for this weekend?

16:00.093 --> 16:02.229
Maddie's always got something
going on.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.164
Volleyball, homework.

16:04.231 --> 16:06.233
Hard to keep track.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.834
We should grab
a bite sometime.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.569
The three of us.

16:11.538 --> 16:12.372
That'd be good.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.809
That wasn't even a distant
cousin of convincing.

16:16.876 --> 16:18.145
No, no really.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.812
It'd be nice
for you guys to meet.

16:19.879 --> 16:22.082
- But?
- No but.

16:22.149 --> 16:26.086
- No pressure.
- None felt.

16:35.428 --> 16:38.531
- What?
- Nothing.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.267
Get out of here.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.312
**

17:00.987 --> 17:02.755
Maddie?

17:02.822 --> 17:05.092
She goes, "I don't care
how you get there.
I'm not a taxi."

17:05.158 --> 17:06.859
You can't force her
to take you to The Grove.

17:06.926 --> 17:08.228
I'm not forcing anyone, but--

17:08.295 --> 17:11.331
- Hold on.
- Dinner.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.400
I'll be out in a minute.
I'm talking to Becca.

17:13.466 --> 17:15.602
- Hi Becca.
- Hi, Mr. Bosch.

17:15.668 --> 17:16.969
Dad.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.906
- Okay, okay.
- Just start without me.

17:19.972 --> 17:21.208
It'll get cold.

17:21.274 --> 17:23.143
That's why God made
microwaves.

17:36.789 --> 17:39.792
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

17:39.859 --> 17:42.562
So what's going on
this weekend?

17:42.629 --> 17:44.531
I have matches
Saturday and Sunday.

17:44.597 --> 17:47.334
Both home.
You coming?

17:47.400 --> 17:49.436
Of course.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.938
You doing homework?

17:52.004 --> 17:54.073
Just finished.

17:58.678 --> 18:01.281
- That our kid?
- Bless his little
trick turning heart.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.124
Let's go. Somebody wants
to talk to you.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.192
Put it down. Let's go.

18:12.259 --> 18:15.094
- Shit.
- Come on.

18:27.374 --> 18:28.841
What up, man?

18:32.345 --> 18:34.847
Looking for Helen Archer.

18:34.914 --> 18:37.584
There you go.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.453
Thanks, bro.

18:43.022 --> 18:45.458
- Helen Archer?
- Yeah.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.694
Detective Bosch.
Detective Edgar.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.196
LAPD Homicide.

18:49.262 --> 18:52.232
Homicide, huh?
Who's dead?

18:52.299 --> 18:53.866
William Meadows.

18:59.272 --> 19:01.274
I just saw Billy last month.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.576
I took him out
for something to eat.

19:03.643 --> 19:07.380
- How was he?
- Strung-out and mangy.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.251
He nodded off at dinner.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.354
Couldn't even hold
a knife and a fork.

19:14.421 --> 19:15.922
I had to cut
his steak for him.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.625
You and Billy.
More than friends?

19:19.959 --> 19:21.828
Pals.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.296
Just pals.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.366
Stupid name he had for us.

19:27.800 --> 19:32.339
He had some in-country romance
he was hanging onto.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.375
That her?

19:38.278 --> 19:39.846
I wouldn't know.

19:39.912 --> 19:44.183
You know he was talking about
going back over there again.

19:44.251 --> 19:46.719
- He re-upped?
- Oh God, Christ, no.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.288
As PMCs.

19:48.355 --> 19:49.689
You know, contractors.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.791
You know, it's typical
addict bullshit.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.193
Like going over there
was gonna solve anything.

19:54.261 --> 19:56.162
Guys from his old unit?

19:56.229 --> 19:58.465
I don't know, I guess.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.999
You know,
I didn't know them.

20:00.066 --> 20:02.168
I didn't even know
their names.

20:02.235 --> 20:04.504
We hear he might have had
a falling out with some
of them.

20:04.571 --> 20:07.240
Well, that'd be news to me.
Cause, he was talking about

20:07.307 --> 20:08.741
how great it was gonna be
this time

20:08.808 --> 20:11.411
and how much money
they were all gonna make.

20:11.478 --> 20:14.714
This time?
Had he done it before?

20:14.781 --> 20:20.119
As a contractor?
Yeah, a couple of times.

20:20.186 --> 20:22.589
God, my poor Billy.

20:22.655 --> 20:23.756
You know,
he was so deluded.

20:23.823 --> 20:26.025
He was never going back
there again.

20:26.092 --> 20:27.193
Why would you say that?

20:27.260 --> 20:28.628
Haven't you been
listening to me?

20:28.695 --> 20:30.297
He was a wreck.

20:30.363 --> 20:31.798
He had this asshole friend.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.933
He just-- He just kept
filling his head

20:34.000 --> 20:35.402
with smoke
and leading him on.

20:35.468 --> 20:36.736
This asshole have
a name?

20:36.803 --> 20:38.405
Yeah, of course
he has a fucking name.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.875
I'm sorry.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.511
I'm sorry. I just--

20:46.212 --> 20:48.381
Woody. Something.

20:48.448 --> 20:51.284
I-- You know, I never met him.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.453
And to be honest
with you guys,

20:53.520 --> 20:55.555
I didn't know any of them.

20:55.622 --> 20:57.524
It's quite possible he
was making it all up.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.693
All of it. All of this shit.
Everything.

21:02.429 --> 21:07.266
You know, it wasn't
so long ago that...

21:07.334 --> 21:09.001
he was doing better.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.772
And then...

21:15.308 --> 21:16.543
...he wasn't.

21:24.751 --> 21:27.420
Bosch.
Your boy's in Room One.

21:27.487 --> 21:28.655
I'm sure he's thirsty
by now.

21:30.323 --> 21:32.725
- I have to make a call.
- I'll take this.

21:36.529 --> 21:38.465
This is Rick Jackson.

21:38.531 --> 21:39.866
Leave a message.
I'll get back to you.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.502
Jerry Edgar again.

21:42.569 --> 21:45.438
I can come to you.
Whatever works.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.039
Give me a call
when you have a chance.

21:47.106 --> 21:48.074
Thanks.

21:50.910 --> 21:53.212
Hey, I didn't do it.
I heard about that guy

21:53.279 --> 21:54.514
that got jumped outside
the 7-Eleven.

21:54.581 --> 21:56.048
That wasn't me.

22:11.163 --> 22:14.100
You recognize that land whale?

22:14.166 --> 22:15.368
No.

22:16.503 --> 22:17.704
Take another look.

22:24.877 --> 22:25.712
Maybe.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.279
I might have seen it before.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.781
I dunno.

22:36.423 --> 22:38.057
You were tagging,

22:38.124 --> 22:40.126
but you didn't finish.

22:41.728 --> 22:45.264
We found a half a can
of spray paint at the scene.

22:45.331 --> 22:46.666
Same color.

22:46.733 --> 22:49.035
What tagger throws away
a half a can?

22:49.101 --> 22:53.005
You were interrupted
before you could finish.

22:53.072 --> 22:55.107
By what?

22:58.611 --> 23:00.012
We're very interested

23:00.079 --> 23:01.448
and we'd like to take
the next step.

23:01.514 --> 23:02.782
I'm open to that.

23:02.849 --> 23:04.383
Let us fly you up
for the day.

23:04.451 --> 23:06.052
A formal interview?

23:06.118 --> 23:08.788
Call it a first date.
See if there's chemistry.

23:08.855 --> 23:12.258
I'm betting there is.

23:12.324 --> 23:13.593
I'll check my schedule.

23:13.660 --> 23:14.994
Do that,
and I'll clear mine.

23:15.061 --> 23:17.497
Look forward to meeting you,
Chief.

23:22.469 --> 23:24.604
Look, I had my scrip going.

23:24.671 --> 23:27.073
Into it, you know?

23:29.208 --> 23:31.410
Then this ride pulls up.

23:31.478 --> 23:33.480
Okay, when was that?

23:33.546 --> 23:36.916
Around midnight, maybe.

23:36.983 --> 23:40.286
- What kind of car?
- SUV.

23:40.352 --> 23:43.990
- Make? Model?
- Sorry.

23:44.056 --> 23:47.159
- Color?
- Black.

23:47.226 --> 23:49.596
Okay.

23:49.662 --> 23:52.231
So it pulls up.
Then what?

23:52.298 --> 23:53.666
I hid.

23:55.334 --> 23:57.637
Did you hear anything?
See anything?

23:58.638 --> 24:00.306
Too dark.

24:00.372 --> 24:01.908
Too dark to hear?

24:01.974 --> 24:04.977
Too far away.
Too much traffic.

24:05.044 --> 24:08.414
Just waiting for them
to leave.

24:08.481 --> 24:11.951
- Them?
- Whoever. In the car.

24:12.018 --> 24:13.920
There was more
than one guy in the car?

24:13.986 --> 24:15.822
It beats me.

24:17.456 --> 24:20.459
- The driver?
- I didn't see him.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.028
He see you?

24:24.430 --> 24:25.798
I don't think so.

24:49.522 --> 24:51.624
No.

24:52.625 --> 24:55.461
Look, man, that's all I know.

24:55.528 --> 24:57.029
All right? Can I go now?

24:57.096 --> 25:00.466
What'd you do when
the black SUV pulled away?

25:00.533 --> 25:02.101
I got outta there.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.539
And you didn't go
and check out the RV?

25:06.606 --> 25:08.641
I didn't go anywhere near it.

25:42.174 --> 25:46.679
Snipers. Five-hundred meters
on the T of two.

25:46.746 --> 25:49.215
Five. Four. Three.

25:54.687 --> 25:57.423
That's the kind
a sugar papa likes.

25:57.489 --> 25:59.225
Fuck you, bitch, I won.

25:59.291 --> 26:02.228
How you figure that?
I didn't hear you hit
the five.

26:02.294 --> 26:03.830
That's 'cause I hit the eight.

26:03.896 --> 26:06.432
Asshole.
That's not what he called.

26:06.498 --> 26:08.200
Yeah, but it is
the tougher shot.

26:08.267 --> 26:10.536
And Xavi, I don't play
for second place.

26:10.603 --> 26:11.771
Dobbs.

26:15.541 --> 26:17.143
Yeah. Impressive.

26:17.209 --> 26:19.646
- But what did I call?
- Five hundred.

26:19.712 --> 26:21.648
And what did you hit,
Woodrow?

26:21.714 --> 26:23.816
The eight hundred.
But Captain--

26:23.883 --> 26:25.918
So you missed
the five hundred completely?

26:25.985 --> 26:27.586
I wasn't fucking aiming
for it--

26:27.654 --> 26:29.121
You fucking lost,
asshole.

26:29.188 --> 26:31.390
You scored zero
on the mission, soldier.

26:31.457 --> 26:33.159
Never could follow orders.

26:33.225 --> 26:35.795
Yeah, fuck you both.

26:35.862 --> 26:37.563
Xavi and shit head.

26:37.630 --> 26:39.198
Stand by.

26:39.265 --> 26:43.535
Twelve-hundred meters
on the T of two.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.739
Five. Four. Three.

26:55.047 --> 26:56.983
You know this one?
Been there?

26:59.285 --> 27:00.987
It's okay.

27:01.053 --> 27:02.822
Place to stay
when it's cold.

27:02.889 --> 27:04.657
Beats the youth halls.

27:04.724 --> 27:07.526
Like you would know.

27:07.593 --> 27:10.062
You'd be surprised.

27:10.129 --> 27:11.130
Bullshit.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.834
McClaren mostly.

27:16.635 --> 27:19.638
- Seriously?
- I was a runner.

27:20.707 --> 27:22.909
You ever get away
for long?

27:22.975 --> 27:25.244
Once. For six weeks.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.227
If you think of anything.

27:49.769 --> 27:53.339
When you ran,
how far'd you make it?

27:53.405 --> 27:55.641
Not far enough.

27:55.708 --> 27:59.846
Anyway, you remember anything,
give me a call, yeah?

28:09.588 --> 28:11.991
He's fifty-something.
He wakes up,

28:12.058 --> 28:13.525
goes to work, comes home.

28:13.592 --> 28:15.494
Same shit, different shovel,
every day.

28:15.561 --> 28:18.965
Teenage daughter.
Ex in Hong Kong someplace,
I think.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.699
They talk about
that shit all the time.

28:20.767 --> 28:22.301
It's boring fucking shit.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.270
I'm telling you,
this guy is not a problem.

28:24.336 --> 28:25.671
We don't need to sweat it.

28:25.738 --> 28:28.775
- He's a Fifth Group guy.
- No shit.

28:28.841 --> 28:31.277
Yeah, and good
at what he does.

28:31.343 --> 28:34.513
Maybe back in the day.
But now? He's fucking old.

28:34.580 --> 28:35.714
He's past it.

28:35.782 --> 28:37.817
Do not fucking
underestimate him.

28:42.088 --> 28:44.757
- And toss your phones.
- For fuck's sake, Dobbs.

28:44.824 --> 28:48.227
New burners at the office.
Do it today.

28:48.294 --> 28:49.695
And cash only.

28:49.762 --> 28:51.363
That includes your chica.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.565
Hmm. I'll cut up her cards.

28:53.632 --> 28:56.002
This surveillance shit.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.503
How much longer
I gotta do that?

28:57.569 --> 28:59.772
Oh, I'm sorry.

28:59.839 --> 29:01.808
Is it cutting into
your surf time?

29:01.874 --> 29:03.810
As a matter of fact it is.

29:03.876 --> 29:05.912
A little longer.

29:05.978 --> 29:08.147
We gotta know what he knows.

29:08.214 --> 29:11.317
I'm telling you,
this guy has no ties to us.

29:11.383 --> 29:13.886
Keep on him.

29:13.953 --> 29:16.155
Just till the other thing
is done.

29:16.222 --> 29:19.258
How is our friend
in the South Bay?

29:19.325 --> 29:21.427
Still friendly.

29:23.796 --> 29:25.097
Crate and Barrel.

29:25.164 --> 29:27.499
Bosch. Oh, listen to this.

29:27.566 --> 29:29.135
"This dogged detective,

29:29.201 --> 29:32.604
tireless in his pursuit of
this suspected serial killer."

29:32.671 --> 29:33.772
End-quote.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.707
He thinks you're a dog,
Harry.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.077
- Who does?
- Scott Anderson.

29:38.144 --> 29:40.712
Just posted this thing
about the Gunn case.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.514
You're featured prominently.

29:42.581 --> 29:45.151
"Detective Bosch could not
be reached for comment."

29:45.217 --> 29:46.418
Fuck him.

29:46.485 --> 29:49.488
"Edward Gunn, found dead
outside his Hollywood apartment

29:49.555 --> 29:51.590
"showed signs he'd been
involved in a struggle.

29:51.657 --> 29:53.826
Ante-mortem bruising."

29:53.893 --> 29:55.694
How the fuck he get that
so fast?

29:55.761 --> 29:57.596
I know guys would give it up
for a wink

29:57.663 --> 29:58.797
and a cup of coffee.

29:58.865 --> 29:59.999
You guys seen J. Edgar?

30:00.066 --> 30:02.134
Haven't seen him.

30:08.274 --> 30:10.142
Jerry. I'm going
to see our friend.

30:10.209 --> 30:12.278
Hit me back, I'll give
you the when and where.

30:14.213 --> 30:16.048
Roll down those sleeves,
detective.

30:16.115 --> 30:18.184
- Excuse me?
- Your sleeves?

30:18.250 --> 30:20.319
Unless you wanna scrape
those tats off

30:20.386 --> 30:22.721
with a wire brush,
not in my station.

30:22.788 --> 30:23.956
Yes, ma'am.

30:33.432 --> 30:36.602
The Seven Deadly Sins
andthe Four Last Things.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.304
By Bosch.

30:38.370 --> 30:39.939
One of his followers,
actually.

30:40.006 --> 30:43.775
Greed, wrath, gluttony,
etcetera,

30:43.842 --> 30:46.378
all depicted along
the outer rim.

30:46.445 --> 30:49.581
The circular image
is the eye of God.

30:49.648 --> 30:51.984
He sees all.

30:52.051 --> 30:53.019
The Latin.

30:53.085 --> 30:56.588
Cave Cave Deus Videt.

30:56.655 --> 30:58.657
"Beware, Beware, God Sees."

30:58.724 --> 31:00.492
You speak Latin?

31:00.559 --> 31:01.994
No. Google Translate does.

31:02.061 --> 31:04.263
Correct. God sees.

31:07.333 --> 31:08.834
Dark shit.

31:08.901 --> 31:11.103
Dark shit indeed.

31:11.170 --> 31:15.041
Hieronymus Bosch envisioned
a world engulfed in evil.

31:15.107 --> 31:17.409
The darkness more than light.

31:18.444 --> 31:20.212
The Garden of Earthly Delights.

31:20.279 --> 31:23.315
Meesterwerk.
His masterpiece.

31:23.382 --> 31:24.783
The owls.

31:24.850 --> 31:26.018
What do they mean?

31:26.085 --> 31:27.453
They're the symbol
of evil.

31:27.519 --> 31:30.889
Even in the Garden of Eden,
evil lurks.

31:33.625 --> 31:34.961
After the fall,

31:35.027 --> 31:38.397
sinful man wraps his arms
around evil.

31:38.464 --> 31:41.333
He embraces it.

31:41.400 --> 31:45.071
Ultimately, it all leads
to Hell, Detective.

31:47.806 --> 31:49.608
How is it you're back
in the world?

31:49.675 --> 31:52.344
Ah, most of Marks' crew
got indicted on a RICO.

31:52.411 --> 31:55.047
Including Lucky Luke Rykov.

31:55.114 --> 31:57.649
Rumor has it, though,
he's back in St. Petersburg.

31:57.716 --> 31:58.717
Aw, you miss him,
don't you?

31:58.784 --> 31:59.952
Oh, you have no idea.

32:00.019 --> 32:03.189
My life is very boring
without him.

32:03.255 --> 32:05.024
So what do I owe
this pleasure?

32:06.292 --> 32:09.095
Ah, you know what that is.
Pallets of cash

32:09.161 --> 32:10.862
to rebuild Afghanistan
and Iraq

32:10.929 --> 32:14.200
and to convince the klepto
warlord asshole politicians

32:14.266 --> 32:16.502
- to do the right thing.
- What could possibly go wrong?

32:16.568 --> 32:17.736
Yeah, brilliant, right?

32:17.803 --> 32:19.938
What's that gotta do
with your vic?

32:20.006 --> 32:21.273
I need some
general background.

32:21.340 --> 32:24.010
- On what?
- Guys he served with.

32:24.076 --> 32:26.712
Might've gone back
to Afghanistan as PMCs.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.080
I'd like to know when.

32:28.147 --> 32:29.515
I'll tell ya,
we got more of those cowboys

32:29.581 --> 32:31.517
running around Afghanistan
than we do our own troops.

32:31.583 --> 32:35.221
NSA and DOD are both outsourcing
their bad shit to the PMCs.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.489
Plausible deniability.

32:37.556 --> 32:40.092
Military where our military
ain't supposed to be.

32:40.159 --> 32:42.228
Ambassador duty,
combat support,

32:42.294 --> 32:43.695
recon on high interest
targets.

32:43.762 --> 32:45.431
Those guys
are doing everything.

32:45.497 --> 32:50.002
Protecting intel community,
assets, OGAs.

32:50.069 --> 32:52.904
Other Government Agencies.
CIA.

32:52.971 --> 32:56.608
Now, who-- who said
cops were dumb?

32:58.644 --> 33:01.613
What's this?
"ODA. Three-nine-nine-two"?

33:01.680 --> 33:03.182
My vic's Special Forces team

33:03.249 --> 33:04.416
when they were
"nation building"

33:04.483 --> 33:06.318
in Anbar
and then Afghanistan.

33:06.385 --> 33:10.156
Oh. I'll see
what I can find out.

33:11.523 --> 33:14.060
I envy the clarity
of your mission, Bosch.

33:14.126 --> 33:16.062
Somebody's dead,
and somebody did it.

33:16.128 --> 33:19.565
Not always as simple
as it seems.

33:19.631 --> 33:21.433
We knew he was good
for two murders

33:21.500 --> 33:23.902
and we were watching him,
we busted down the door,

33:23.969 --> 33:25.871
and caught Gunn
raping that girl.

33:25.937 --> 33:27.473
Red-handed.
I mean, literally.

33:27.539 --> 33:29.575
He'd beaten her
pretty good, too.

33:29.641 --> 33:31.910
She said afterwards
it was consensual.

33:31.977 --> 33:33.845
Refused to cooperate.

33:33.912 --> 33:36.682
Didn't want to let
the family know that
she was a prostitute.

33:36.748 --> 33:38.550
You know, Harry didn't
wanna press her.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.719
Figured she'd been
through enough already.

33:40.786 --> 33:43.322
Yeah, he thought we could
make the case another way.

33:43.389 --> 33:44.623
When it comes to hookers,

33:44.690 --> 33:46.158
Harry's heart bleeds.

33:46.225 --> 33:47.426
For obvious reasons.

33:47.493 --> 33:50.129
Understandable.
Absolutely.

33:50.196 --> 33:51.863
Then O'Shea fucked you guys.

33:51.930 --> 33:53.499
That motherless prick.

33:53.565 --> 33:56.102
Wouldn't proceed
without her testimony.

33:56.168 --> 33:58.137
Tell me something.

33:58.204 --> 34:00.939
With Gunn...

34:01.006 --> 34:03.642
did Harry ever...

34:03.709 --> 34:06.145
I don't know, maybe push things
a little too far?

34:06.212 --> 34:08.080
In what way?

34:08.147 --> 34:10.349
It was stuck
in his craw, right?

34:10.416 --> 34:12.618
I mean,
he worked it for years.

34:12.684 --> 34:14.986
Like any righteous
murder police would.

34:15.053 --> 34:18.957
He's going through
something.

34:19.024 --> 34:21.360
And you think
you know someone...

34:21.427 --> 34:22.894
then you're not so sure
anymore.

34:22.961 --> 34:25.264
I'll tell you
what I'm sure about.

34:25.331 --> 34:27.533
In all those cases
we worked together,

34:27.599 --> 34:30.436
never once did I question
whether Harry Bosch was all-in.

34:30.502 --> 34:31.737
Of course not.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.941
I'd appreciate
if we kept this between us.

34:36.007 --> 34:37.609
Goes without saying.

34:37.676 --> 34:39.411
Thanks, Rick.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.674
L.A. Premium.
May I help you?

35:42.741 --> 35:46.212
Yes. I'd like to make
an appointment.

35:46.278 --> 35:47.646
Leah Camille.

36:07.766 --> 36:11.770
I found a surveillance camera
in the smoke detector
in Gunn's apartment.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.275
Well, we don't know
that it's Harry's.

36:16.342 --> 36:18.410
Who else's would it be?

36:18.477 --> 36:21.680
He's been keeping tabs
on Gunn for years.

36:24.650 --> 36:27.819
I took it to latent prints,
off the books.

36:27.886 --> 36:29.488
Jesus, Jerry.

36:29.555 --> 36:31.357
What if they find something?

36:31.423 --> 36:34.860
We'll blow up
that fucking bridge
when we get there.

36:34.926 --> 36:36.161
Okay?

36:36.228 --> 36:38.430
If Robertson lands
on this?

36:38.497 --> 36:39.831
You know he will.

36:39.898 --> 36:41.833
Only a matter of time.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.402
We have to talk to Harry.

36:46.137 --> 36:48.740
It oughta be me.
I'm his partner.

36:48.807 --> 36:51.477
Well, then don't wait.
Just do it.

37:27.413 --> 37:28.780
Anthony Maney?

37:31.016 --> 37:32.584
Come in, beautiful.

37:35.521 --> 37:38.089
Fuck me.
She lied to us, Harry.

37:38.156 --> 37:39.791
More a sin of omission.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.460
How did this not come
up on her background?

37:41.527 --> 37:43.795
No arrest record.
The way they vet her clients,

37:43.862 --> 37:45.431
she's been able to stay
off the radar.

37:45.497 --> 37:47.232
But if we know about it,

37:47.299 --> 37:49.167
Holland's people know
about it, too.

37:49.234 --> 37:52.137
Let's talk to her again.
I'll set it up.

37:52.203 --> 37:53.672
See you later?

37:53.739 --> 37:54.673
Rain check?

37:54.740 --> 37:56.675
Okay.

37:56.742 --> 37:57.876
You sure?

37:57.943 --> 37:59.177
Yeah.

37:59.244 --> 38:00.546
I'll let you know
about Annabelle.

38:00.612 --> 38:01.880
Okay.

38:12.491 --> 38:13.459
What's up?

38:13.525 --> 38:14.793
I'm at the shelter.

38:14.860 --> 38:17.062
Thought I'd take the kid
back to the scene.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.497
Maybe give his memory a nudge.

38:18.564 --> 38:19.931
I went back to that website.

38:19.998 --> 38:21.633
I found that friend
of Meadows.

38:21.700 --> 38:24.436
Woody Woodrow.
Venice address.

38:24.503 --> 38:25.504
Maybe talk to him tomorrow

38:25.571 --> 38:26.838
Good luck with the kid.

38:26.905 --> 38:27.873
Thanks.

38:27.939 --> 38:31.377
Harry, listen--

38:31.443 --> 38:33.345
What's up?

38:35.280 --> 38:37.883
Never mind. Nothing.

38:37.949 --> 38:39.351
Roger that.

39:15.353 --> 39:16.755
Miss?

39:37.342 --> 39:40.712
He didn't stay.
He didn't even check in.

39:40.779 --> 39:42.981
What happens
if you don't check-in?

39:43.048 --> 39:44.416
You sleep elsewhere.

39:44.483 --> 39:46.418
Sharkey's been here,
in and out, over a year.

39:46.485 --> 39:47.786
He knows the rules.

39:47.853 --> 39:50.656
And what about
the sign-in?

39:50.722 --> 39:51.990
Does that have
phone numbers too?

39:52.057 --> 39:53.959
Most of the numbers
are phony,

39:54.025 --> 39:56.327
but I can give you
what I got.

39:56.394 --> 39:59.130
I'll take 'em.

39:59.197 --> 40:01.066
Any idea where he might be?

40:01.132 --> 40:04.269
He's a professional runaway.

40:04.335 --> 40:06.605
Your guess is as good
as mine.

40:17.783 --> 40:19.317
We're sorry.

40:19.384 --> 40:22.788
You have a number that is
no longer in service.

40:48.814 --> 40:51.550
- Koreatown Killer?
- Looks like.

40:51.617 --> 40:54.452
Pretty brazen.
Broad daylight.

40:54.520 --> 40:56.555
How long since
the last one?

40:56.622 --> 40:59.591
Two recent incidents
we think are KTK.

40:59.658 --> 41:02.393
A robbery.
Attempted car jacking.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.630
Since the last murder.
How long?

41:04.696 --> 41:06.064
More than a year.

41:10.502 --> 41:13.171
Where's the family?

41:13.238 --> 41:14.239
I'll take you.

41:33.358 --> 41:35.360
Um, Jun Park. CRT.

41:35.426 --> 41:37.563
We're glad you're here.

41:37.629 --> 41:38.997
And you are?

41:39.064 --> 41:40.966
Chief Irving,
Acting Chief of Police.

41:42.868 --> 41:44.636
That's embarrassing.
I'm sorry. I should've--

41:44.703 --> 41:46.271
I should've have
recognized you.

41:48.874 --> 41:51.076
Can you please tell
the family how sorry I am?

41:51.142 --> 41:52.611
Certainly.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.955
I can't make out the signature.

42:04.022 --> 42:06.424
I don't think
she told me her name.

42:06.491 --> 42:08.359
Did you make
a copy of her ID?

42:08.426 --> 42:10.361
It was late.

42:10.428 --> 42:12.598
It was late. Okay.

42:12.664 --> 42:14.465
Paid cash.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.434
I remember that.

42:16.501 --> 42:18.637
Remember what
she looked like?

42:18.704 --> 42:21.840
Late 20s, Hispanic,
dark hair.

42:21.907 --> 42:23.474
High heels
and a red dress.

42:23.541 --> 42:25.410
At that hour?

42:25.476 --> 42:26.544
Like she'd been out
all night

42:26.612 --> 42:28.013
and hadn't been home.

42:28.079 --> 42:29.247
Not my type.

42:29.314 --> 42:30.682
Sure.

42:32.517 --> 42:34.720
He kept 'em coming,
all night.

42:34.786 --> 42:36.054
Tuned him up pretty good.

42:36.121 --> 42:39.090
Eddie got louder and louder,
just outta control.

42:39.157 --> 42:41.026
Next thing you know,
he's pissing on the jukebox.

42:41.092 --> 42:42.460
And that's where
you draw the line?

42:42.527 --> 42:44.863
I can put up with a lot.

42:44.930 --> 42:46.231
But when they start pissing
on the jukebox,

42:46.297 --> 42:47.733
that's when I call
the paddy wagon.

42:47.799 --> 42:50.836
The big guy
buying the drinks?

42:50.902 --> 42:54.706
Um... like you, but white.

42:54.773 --> 42:56.074
Like me but white?

42:56.141 --> 42:58.877
Like you in the sense
that he was a cop.

42:58.944 --> 43:01.146
Cop or military.
I'd put money on it.

43:01.212 --> 43:02.413
What makes you so sure?

43:02.480 --> 43:04.683
It's just a vibe.

43:04.750 --> 43:06.752
Way you carry yourselves.

43:08.219 --> 43:10.722
After you called the cops,
what'd the big guy do?

43:10.789 --> 43:13.692
He took it on the arches.

43:13.759 --> 43:14.860
You are old fashioned.

43:14.926 --> 43:17.162
You have no idea.

44:26.965 --> 44:28.800
Hey. I'm gonna go do
some work in my bedroom.

44:28.867 --> 44:30.401
Come say goodnight
before you go to sleep?

44:30.468 --> 44:32.237
- Okay.
- Okay.

44:58.363 --> 44:59.364
Shit.

45:05.336 --> 45:08.139
This is Bosch. I have an ADW
with a vehicle on a PO.

45:08.206 --> 45:11.209
Gray SUV, heading on
Blue Heights Drive
toward the Valley.

45:11.276 --> 45:13.511
I need an airship,
and give the units

45:13.578 --> 45:15.180
the following access points.

45:17.315 --> 45:19.350
Fuck! Fuck!

45:32.463 --> 45:33.932
All units stand by.

45:33.999 --> 45:35.366
Off-duty officer
is in pursuit

45:35.433 --> 45:38.236
of an ADW suspect
in the Hollywood Hills.

45:38.303 --> 45:39.805
Last known direction
was on Blue Heights Drive

45:39.871 --> 45:41.272
toward the Valley.

45:50.548 --> 45:51.983
Six-William-Lincoln-Twenty-One,

45:52.050 --> 45:53.985
I'm in the Hollywood Hills,
below Mulholland.

45:54.052 --> 45:56.554
Any airship, come up
on Hollywood frequency.

45:56.621 --> 45:59.290
Six-William-Lincoln-Twenty-One
is in pursuit.

45:59.357 --> 46:01.860
Last known location
in the Hollywood Hills.

46:01.927 --> 46:03.494
West of Cahuenga,
north of Mulholland.

46:44.769 --> 46:46.471
Air Three, we're overhead.

46:46.537 --> 46:47.973
Air Three, I lost the vehicle

46:48.039 --> 46:51.042
in the area of Vineland
and Ventura.

47:18.569 --> 47:21.306
Fifteen-Adam-Sixty-Seven,
we're Code Six.
