NARRATOR: Previously on
Once Upon A Time...

00:03.420 --> 00:06.753
My older brother Zeus
stopped my heart.

00:07.549 --> 00:09.289
What I'm left with is anger.

00:09.426 --> 00:11.087
There's only one way
out of a sleeping curse.

00:11.136 --> 00:12.216
True love's kiss.

00:12.262 --> 00:13.968
You're not the one
who's going to wake me.

00:14.097 --> 00:15.086
My father is.

00:15.224 --> 00:20.059
I don't even really care about that book,
except for a few pages about me,

00:20.103 --> 00:21.559
so destroy them.

00:22.439 --> 00:23.804
What do you say, Zelena?

00:23.941 --> 00:27.559
Will you make chaos with me?

00:31.990 --> 00:34.606
(CHUCKLES) The land of the living.

00:34.743 --> 00:37.780
I never thought
I would see this world again.

00:37.829 --> 00:40.115
Not with a beating heart.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.914
And I owe it all to you.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.667
-Do you feel this?
-Yes. (CHUCKLES)

00:46.588 --> 00:49.421
-l'm finally becoming myself again.
-(CHUCKLES)

00:50.008 --> 00:51.339
I'm so glad.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.130
Something's troubling you.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.795
It's my sister.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.138
She's still not here.

00:59.935 --> 01:02.972
I wouldn't worry.
I'm sure she made it back safe.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.636
Well, then why are we
still in the woods?

01:04.773 --> 01:06.183
We should
go back into town and check.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.351
I can't.

01:07.484 --> 01:08.985
Snow White still thinks I'm a villain.

01:09.111 --> 01:11.978
These people are always
looking for villains to blame.

01:12.322 --> 01:14.654
-l'l| tell them you're changed.
-(BABY FUSSING)

01:14.783 --> 01:16.614
That love changed you.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.446
-It certainly did.
-(CHUCKLES)

01:21.290 --> 01:22.370
But...

01:23.625 --> 01:26.867
In case they don't believe me,
would you mind just taking the baby?

01:27.629 --> 01:30.792
Just take it to my sister's office.
You'll be safe there.

01:32.968 --> 01:36.301
You would trust me with your daughter?

01:38.390 --> 01:40.722
l'd trust you with anything.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.889
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

01:53.322 --> 01:54.437
(PANTING)

01:54.698 --> 01:55.813
HADES: Hello, there.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.902
Don't let the shackles fool you.

01:58.327 --> 02:01.535
l'm King Arthur of Camelot.
l was unjustly imprisoned. Please.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.914
Unjustly imprisoned?

02:06.918 --> 02:09.079
That, I understand.

02:10.881 --> 02:11.996
Thank you.

02:12.215 --> 02:13.830
But tell me,

02:14.384 --> 02:18.093
what happened to land you
in such an awful predicament?

02:18.597 --> 02:21.054
l was destined to rule a kingdom.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.010
A broken kingdom.

02:23.602 --> 02:25.558
Not everybody
is as understanding as you.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.188
Now that I understand, as well.

02:27.230 --> 02:31.564
I, too, was destined to rule a kingdom.

02:32.903 --> 02:35.895
-Who are you?
-My name is Hades.

02:37.074 --> 02:38.109
God of Death.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.444
(BABY CRYING)

02:40.577 --> 02:45.697
And I think I was destined to rule
this very kingdom right here.

02:45.749 --> 02:48.240
But... (SHUSHING)

02:49.753 --> 02:50.742
(BABY CRYING)

02:51.088 --> 02:52.453
I will need your help.

02:52.547 --> 02:53.536
(BONE CRACKS)

02:54.716 --> 02:55.956
(HADES SIGHS)

02:57.052 --> 03:00.544
And that will do nicely.

03:13.402 --> 03:14.562
What do you mean Arthur escaped?

03:14.611 --> 03:15.771
I thought you were guarding his cell?

03:15.904 --> 03:18.566
It's not my fault.
This useless lump fell asleep on watch.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.230
You put Sleepy on guard duty?

03:20.283 --> 03:23.116
Hey, you left for weeks.
It was the best I could do with who I had.

03:23.245 --> 03:24.735
All right, well, we can
blame each other later.

03:24.788 --> 03:27.746
Right now, we need a search party.
Gather the dwarfs. Go!

03:28.625 --> 03:30.365
Let's go, Sleepy.

03:30.460 --> 03:31.870
I told you it's Walter.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.702
I know. I agree.

03:34.131 --> 03:36.463
We need our family back soon.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.459
Soon enough?

03:41.638 --> 03:43.253
David!

03:52.816 --> 03:56.229
Hey, big guy. Boy, I missed you.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.650
EMMA: Hey, Mom.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.649
Emma. Henry. Did everyone else...

03:59.781 --> 04:01.282
Regina and Robin. They're here, too.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.817
Grandpa came back with Belle,
at least we think he did.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.155
And Hook?

04:08.999 --> 04:12.412
Oh, Emma. I'm so sorry.

04:13.336 --> 04:16.078
I made so many mistakes, Mom.
I should never have gone down there.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.253
MARY: It's okay.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.006
Look, we all made it back,

04:20.093 --> 04:23.756
and we helped
so many people move on.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.843
You got to see Hook one last time.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.309
Well, there's more to it.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.842
We weren't the only ones
that came through the portal.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.265
Hades and Zelena.
They made it back, too.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.980
They have Robin's baby.

04:36.526 --> 04:39.438
REGINA: Don't worry.
We'll find her, I promise.

04:39.529 --> 04:40.609
ZELENA: Regina.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.653
(EXHALES AND LAUGHS)
You made it back!

04:42.699 --> 04:44.530
-Where the hell...
-Wait.

04:46.328 --> 04:47.613
We need some answers.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.327
Where the hell is my daughter?

04:49.372 --> 04:50.452
With Hades.

04:50.707 --> 04:53.699
Look, I came to explain to everyone
that he's changed.

04:54.503 --> 04:57.210
I hate to be the one to break this to you,
but, no, he hasn't.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.538
What are you talking about?
He helped you.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.210
He took your names off your graves.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.542
No, it was a trick so we'd trust him.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.128
He tried to trap us down there.

05:06.640 --> 05:10.053
No,no,no.
l was with him the whole time.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.223
We waited for you.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.721
That was a show for your benefit.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.222
You cannot trust him
with your daughter.

05:16.358 --> 05:17.393
ZELENA: You're wrong.

05:17.901 --> 05:20.062
Hades is different
now his heart is beating.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.519
Love has changed him.
I've changed him.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.028
I know you wanna believe that.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.732
(EXHALES) Sometimes the truth
really hurts.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.736
Why don't you just tell us where he is?

05:33.250 --> 05:35.832
And what are you planning to do
when you find him?

05:36.419 --> 05:38.159
Well, that depends on him.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.246
But we'll do whatever we have to,
to protect this town.

05:40.382 --> 05:41.542
You mean imprison him?

05:42.342 --> 05:44.082
We'll do whatever we have to.

05:45.011 --> 05:48.424
I know this is hard to hear,
but he is not the man you think he is.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.927
Actually, he's not a man at all.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.097
He is a god.

05:52.936 --> 05:56.599
And if you try to hurt him,
you do so at your own peril.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.111
(TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

06:30.974 --> 06:34.137
Excuse me.
Can you tell me where I am exactly?

06:35.395 --> 06:38.728
He stopped talking
centuries ago. Coffee?

06:38.815 --> 06:41.477
No, I don't want coffee.
I wanna know what this place is.

06:41.568 --> 06:45.777
Well, I think that's quite obvious,
Your Majesty.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.277
You got lucky last time we met.

06:50.327 --> 06:53.660
Now, you tell me where I am,
or I run you through.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.659
Well, you can't kill a dead man,
I'm afraid.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.327
Well, you're having a hard time
accepting it,

06:59.002 --> 07:00.583
but you know where you are.

07:03.465 --> 07:04.500
No.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.136
-No, but I had so much left to do.
-That makes two of us.

07:12.182 --> 07:15.015
I promised someone
that I would move on from this place,

07:15.101 --> 07:16.181
but I still bloody can't.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.514
So I need to know what the hell is
going on up in Storybrooke.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.141
Who killed you?

07:20.190 --> 07:21.930
No! No, no!

07:22.025 --> 07:23.356
Denial, grief, anger.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.025
Can we just get to acceptance?
Who killed you?

07:26.112 --> 07:27.898
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

07:28.698 --> 07:31.110
He said his name was Hades.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.443
Did you see Emma and the others?

07:34.537 --> 07:36.448
Have they any idea how to stop him?

07:36.748 --> 07:38.739
(SlGHS) Haven't you learned anything?

07:39.042 --> 07:41.158
Hades never reveals his weakness.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.795
You know what?

07:46.299 --> 07:47.334
You're right.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.426
Hades protected his secrets well.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.629
But now... Now he's not here.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.839
So, Your Majesty, how would you like
to go on another quest?

07:56.393 --> 07:58.384
(LAUGHS) With you?

07:58.895 --> 07:59.975
Not a chance.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.932
Have you got any idea
why you're down here, mate?

08:05.568 --> 08:08.856
And not up in some blissful afterlife
or fiery hell?

08:08.947 --> 08:13.486
It's because you were a terrible king
with loads of unfinished business.

08:13.576 --> 08:16.784
And when you leave here,
you're either going to the better place,

08:17.789 --> 08:18.904
or a far,

08:19.582 --> 08:21.493
far worse place.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.419
I think I prefer the first option.

08:27.632 --> 08:30.248
Oh, then you're gonna need
a seriously good deed,

08:30.343 --> 08:32.174
you know, to make up for the bad ones.

08:32.637 --> 08:35.344
If I say yes,
what exactly are we questing for?

08:35.432 --> 08:37.263
The answer to defeating Hades.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.389
You can call it my holy grail.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.185
MERIDA: This is where I found him.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.392
I always thought I'd be the one
to put him in his grave.

08:48.486 --> 08:51.273
But now that | see him like this,
I can't help but feel sorry for him.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.229
-Hades did this.
-How do you know?

08:53.324 --> 08:56.157
I know. If we don't stop him,
this isjust the beginning.

08:56.244 --> 08:57.404
And what do you mean by "stop him"?

08:57.787 --> 09:00.119
I mean kill him and send him back
where he came from.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.991
Emma, wait, wait. Slow down.

09:04.085 --> 09:06.918
This is a god we're dealing with, and
we still have no idea how to hurt him.

09:07.005 --> 09:09.496
-Doesn't mean I can't try.
-Look, I get it.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.047
Hook's gone, you're in pain.

09:11.134 --> 09:13.625
-This isn't about Hook.
-Yes, it is.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.636
I am trying to protect Storybrooke.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.304
Are you telling me
I shouldn't fight Hades?

09:18.391 --> 09:19.506
No, of course we're gonna fight him,

09:19.601 --> 09:22.593
but I need you seeing clearly
before we do that.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.762
So, maybe it's time you start dealing
with death the way other people do.

09:25.857 --> 09:27.472
How do other people deal with death?

09:31.154 --> 09:32.314
They grieve.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.736
I thought Regina trusted me.

09:38.703 --> 09:41.410
But she threatened you, to my face.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.332
They're going to try to hurt you.

09:43.416 --> 09:47.204
If anything happened to you
or the baby, I couldn't live with it.

09:48.046 --> 09:49.752
l have to turn myself in.

09:49.839 --> 09:53.127
You'd really give up your freedom?
For me?

09:53.510 --> 09:55.341
(LAUGHS) For you...

09:56.721 --> 09:58.052
I would give up anything.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.267
Wait.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.810
I can't let you do this.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.397
I won't risk losing you again.

10:10.902 --> 10:12.142
Well...

10:13.696 --> 10:15.607
Well, then we have
only one other option.

10:16.324 --> 10:17.905
We have to defend ourselves.

10:17.992 --> 10:20.244
Yes, of course.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.079
I'll put up a protection spell.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.494
What if they break through?

10:23.581 --> 10:25.537
Well, then we'll make them
see the truth!

10:26.209 --> 10:27.198
(SlGHS)

10:28.128 --> 10:29.493
Or we'll fight back.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.088
I hope it doesn't come to a fight,

10:31.172 --> 10:33.413
but if they force us into it,
I do have something.

10:34.425 --> 10:35.631
What?

10:39.055 --> 10:42.639
HADES: A family heirloom.
The Olympian Crystal.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.224
lt belonged to my brother, Zeus.

10:45.728 --> 10:48.856
Very powerful. Very dangerous.

10:50.775 --> 10:53.437
And I've waited a long time to use it.

10:59.742 --> 11:02.404
REGINA: My sister cast a protection
spell on the building.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.780
We can'tjust stand here
and do nothing.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.328
I wasn't planning on doing nothing.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.744
As a matter of fact,
I know exactly what to do.

11:10.211 --> 11:13.328
There's a secret tunnel
that goes right under the Town Hall.

11:13.423 --> 11:14.788
We don't know how to defeat Hades,

11:14.883 --> 11:17.124
but maybe we can
get your daughter back.

11:18.553 --> 11:21.590
And talk some sense into Zelena.
If you're with me.

11:21.681 --> 11:22.796
Of course I am.

11:22.891 --> 11:24.097
Then I'm going, too.

11:24.184 --> 11:28.177
No offense, Emma, but...
(EXHALES) You're too emotional.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.559
I understand. You had a loss,
but you're not thinking straight.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.514
Is that what you...
Is that what you all think?

11:33.610 --> 11:36.443
Emma, we still don't know
how to stop Hades. Until we do...

11:36.529 --> 11:37.939
So then we figure it out.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.612
Well, then do it quickly.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.985
'Cause once we get that baby back,
Hades will be coming for us.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.279
(METAL SCRAPING)

12:00.303 --> 12:01.418
REGINA: Look...

12:02.138 --> 12:05.050
I'm sorry I trusted Zelena
with your daughter.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.221
Glad to finally hear it.

12:06.309 --> 12:08.641
(SlGHS) Just, for once,
I was trying to be optimistic

12:08.728 --> 12:10.844
and give her a second chance,
like you gave me.

12:10.939 --> 12:12.930
You deserved it. She doesn't.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.561
All she wants is what I have.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.983
I made her think love was possible...

12:18.071 --> 12:22.064
So you're not actually apologizing,
you're defending her, again?

12:22.408 --> 12:23.488
Robin, no...

12:23.576 --> 12:26.818
No, forgive me if I don't care to listen.
l have a daughter to save.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.584
What the hell do you want?

12:39.425 --> 12:40.926
No need to be testy.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.256
I'm here on Belle's behalf.

12:45.223 --> 12:47.214
Well, then she can
come talk to me herself.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.388
She can't, I'm afraid.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.637
She's trapped under a sleeping curse.

12:52.397 --> 12:55.605
There's only one way to wake her.
True love's kiss.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.478
And yours didn't work.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.402
I'm glad to hear
some good sense for her at last.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.195
She needs her father.

13:03.408 --> 13:04.693
You're right.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.068
And that's why I'm not gonna do it.
Not for you.

13:08.162 --> 13:10.198
(STAMMERS) You hate me so much,

13:10.915 --> 13:14.373
you'd leave your own daughter
trapped under a sleeping spell?

13:14.460 --> 13:16.576
Better that than the spell you put on her.

13:16.671 --> 13:19.504
Convincing that beautiful girl
to love you.

13:19.590 --> 13:23.959
So, until you're gone for good,
she stays asleep.

13:26.014 --> 13:28.630
Yeah, you know,
I was afraid you were gonna say that.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.010
So, uh...

13:30.935 --> 13:33.051
I brought along an old friend.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.269
(THUDS LOUDLY)

13:37.525 --> 13:39.436
Remember the taste of this?

13:40.361 --> 13:42.226
I don't care what you do to me.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.647
l'll die before I give in.

13:45.742 --> 13:48.154
Well, I'm more than happy
to test that theory.

13:49.412 --> 13:51.653
Enough. Get out. Go.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.829
What are you doing here?
I need your help.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.744
Miss Swan!

13:59.339 --> 14:01.455
I'm not the only one who made it back.
Hades is in Storybrooke.

14:02.216 --> 14:03.831
l have to stop him.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.125
So I was hoping

14:07.930 --> 14:10.057
you could tell me how to kill him.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.845
Well, even if! knew,
why would I tell you?

14:14.562 --> 14:16.678
You're the one
that got us into this mess.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.400
KlLLlAN: If there's a way
to defeat Hades,

14:22.445 --> 14:23.730
the answer will have to be in here.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.561
ARTHUR: What is this place?
KlLLlAN: It's his throne room.

14:25.615 --> 14:27.651
Or dungeon, depending on his mood.

14:27.742 --> 14:30.484
The last time l was here, I spent
most of my time at the end of a lash.

14:33.331 --> 14:36.494
Sounds like this Hades
was an even worse king than I was.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.418
What exactly is this "holy grail"
we're looking for?

14:45.259 --> 14:46.385
lt's pages from a storybook.

14:48.513 --> 14:51.050
I know it doesn't sound like much,

14:51.140 --> 14:54.052
but Hades went to great lengths
to keep them from us.

14:55.311 --> 14:57.677
I think these pages
can tell us his weakness.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.478
All we have to do is find them.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.780
There's nothing here.

15:10.326 --> 15:11.736
Maybe you were wrong about this.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.068
I can't be wrong!

15:13.162 --> 15:14.948
Hades is up there now
threatening Emma,

15:15.039 --> 15:17.655
and l bloody well need
to find a way to save her!

15:19.669 --> 15:21.159
| get it now.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.916
This is all about a woman.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.167
Aye.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.883
A woman who risked everything for me.

15:29.303 --> 15:32.636
And the last promise I made her was
that I would move on from this place,

15:32.723 --> 15:34.759
and I can't do that!

15:36.227 --> 15:38.058
Not while she's still in danger.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.095
Now, please, come on. You...

15:41.190 --> 15:43.021
You were a king once.

15:43.651 --> 15:46.142
Where did you hide your treasure?

15:50.575 --> 15:53.692
The most important stuff I hid in a place
no one would ever dare touch.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.579
My throne.

15:58.833 --> 15:59.993
(CLICKS)

16:02.628 --> 16:04.084
Well, look at that.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.127
Your holy grail.

16:16.601 --> 16:18.387
l have to get this to Emma.

16:18.436 --> 16:19.551
What have you found?

16:20.229 --> 16:23.141
The one answer
she's been looking for most of all.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.144
The way to destroy a god.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.737
I thought you guys
would come back soon.

16:35.786 --> 16:37.742
l smelled a bromance.

16:37.788 --> 16:38.823
Table for two?

16:38.915 --> 16:41.281
We're not here for a meal.
We're here for her.

16:41.417 --> 16:42.918
CRUELLA: Oh, back up!

16:44.253 --> 16:46.414
Seriously, back up.

16:47.089 --> 16:50.752
Let me take a gander at this handsome
new addition to the UndenNorld.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.093
We have to get a message
to our friends in the world above.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.971
You ripped out the phone booth
that can do that. Now, where is it?

16:57.058 --> 16:58.093
CRUELLA: Oh...

16:58.142 --> 17:00.303
As appealing
as this stubble sandwich is,

17:01.145 --> 17:03.352
I'm pretty certain lying to you
won't get me what I want.

17:03.439 --> 17:04.770
You'll eventually work out the truth.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.098
So here it is and on your way.

17:07.151 --> 17:10.268
l destroyed the phone booth. Sorry.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.443
Why would you do that?

17:11.531 --> 17:15.194
Because, darling, I can't have anyone
resolving their unfinished business.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.320
That would be no fun.

17:17.453 --> 17:20.820
And if I'm going to be trapped in here,
so is everyone else.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.534
The book.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.825
Where is it?

17:25.962 --> 17:27.953
In Sight, but out of reach.

17:28.839 --> 17:30.795
I put it in the River of Souls.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.967
If we can get our hands on that book,

17:36.013 --> 17:38.846
I may have a way
to get those pages to Emma.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.299
Oh.

17:42.812 --> 17:43.847
Emma, where've you been?

17:44.855 --> 17:47.016
It doesn't matter. It was a dead end.

17:47.525 --> 17:48.514
Have you guys found anything?

17:48.651 --> 17:50.767
(CHUCKLES) Oh, are you kidding?
We're literally drowning in books.

17:50.820 --> 17:53.653
There's gotta be something in here
about Hades, but we just started, so...

17:53.990 --> 17:55.651
Oh, we could really use your help.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.316
(SlGHS) Sorry, I don't have time
to go through a bunch of books.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.201
I should have gone after Hades
when I had the chance.

18:01.831 --> 18:03.537
DAVID: Emma, wait.

18:04.709 --> 18:06.540
(SCOFFS) We know you're hurting.

18:06.669 --> 18:09.706
But getting revenge on Hades
is not gonna bring Hook back.

18:09.839 --> 18:10.999
This is not about revenge.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.671
Then what is it about, Emma?

18:12.758 --> 18:14.498
I cannot grieve Hook's death

18:14.552 --> 18:16.383
because I know he's still trapped
in the Unden/vorld.

18:16.512 --> 18:17.592
I know he's still in pain.

18:17.680 --> 18:20.672
And the last thing I told him was
that he needed to move on.

18:21.726 --> 18:24.889
You're right. We have to help Hook.

18:25.021 --> 18:28.764
So, why don't you sit down and help us
find a way to defeat Hades?

18:28.858 --> 18:30.018
For Hook.

18:40.578 --> 18:42.944
My brother didn't want me to have this.

18:43.039 --> 18:45.701
So he stopped my heart,
broke the Crystal.

18:46.042 --> 18:49.876
Without a beating heart, I didn't have
the power to put it back together.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.578
But now, thanks to you,

18:55.885 --> 18:57.591
different story.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.055
(EXHALES)

19:04.477 --> 19:07.059
I'm sorry
your brother didn't believe in you.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.135
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

19:08.731 --> 19:09.891
Don't be.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.394
I've only had a few thousand years
to dwell on it.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.902
And once I make this whole,

19:17.073 --> 19:19.735
we can show everyone
they were wrong about us.

19:19.784 --> 19:22.821
We can live any life we want.

19:23.412 --> 19:24.822
(BREATHES DEEPLY) Mmm.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.620
That sounds lovely.

19:26.749 --> 19:30.788
We could even rule this place together.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.160
Rule Storybrooke?

19:34.090 --> 19:36.581
But I thought we were just
planning to live here, you know?

19:37.843 --> 19:39.925
Nice little house,

19:40.179 --> 19:42.090
and my daughter playing in the garden.

19:42.223 --> 19:44.680
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

19:44.767 --> 19:46.632
I want that, too.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.475
But...

19:54.318 --> 19:56.775
These people,
they're leaving us no choice.

19:56.862 --> 20:01.481
We might have to
make a show of strength.

20:01.617 --> 20:02.652
To survive.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.028
(TELEPHONE RINGS)

20:14.130 --> 20:15.791
Hello?

20:15.840 --> 20:17.125
Welcome to Storybrooke.

Rumplestiltskin.

20:19.135 --> 20:21.501
GOLD: lheard you were in town.

20:21.637 --> 20:24.174
Now, how would you like
to put our sordid past behind us

20:24.306 --> 20:25.807
and make a deal?

20:25.850 --> 20:27.010
Oh, I don't need your deals.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.633
You certain about that?

20:28.769 --> 20:31.476
You're a stranger in a strange land,
full of enemies.

20:33.441 --> 20:35.181
/ could protect you.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.649
In exchange for
a piece of that Olympian Crystal.

20:37.737 --> 20:38.726
(SCOFFS)

20:39.655 --> 20:40.770
How do you know about that?

20:40.823 --> 20:43.530
You don't smuggle magic like that
into Storybrooke

20:43.659 --> 20:45.490
without getting my attention.

20:45.536 --> 20:49.120
We're not in your kingdom anymore.
We're in mine.

20:49.165 --> 20:50.325
Not for long.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.994
Can't say I didn't warn you.

20:59.717 --> 21:01.503
Welcome to the Town Hall.

21:01.552 --> 21:04.134
Secret passage, indeed.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.011
Thank you, Regina.

21:06.140 --> 21:07.346
You're welcome.

21:08.559 --> 21:11.847
And I know you
can't accept this right now,

21:13.147 --> 21:15.229
but I do feel horrible for what I did.

21:17.151 --> 21:19.563
I'm sorry Zelena has your daughter,

21:19.695 --> 21:23.904
and I'm really trying to make up for it.

21:25.326 --> 21:26.736
You're right.

21:28.078 --> 21:31.036
We do owe Zelena another chance.

21:31.999 --> 21:33.535
Oh, don'tjust say that to appease me...

21:33.667 --> 21:35.373
No, I'm not.

21:35.503 --> 21:38.916
If being with you
has taught me anything,

21:39.048 --> 21:41.915
it's that we all have
the capability to change.

21:42.051 --> 21:44.383
And the future is not written by our past.

21:46.931 --> 21:49.013
Regina,

21:49.058 --> 21:50.423
you are my future.

22:03.239 --> 22:04.604
Okay, thief.

22:06.075 --> 22:08.066
Tell me what the plan is.

22:08.369 --> 22:11.736
(SlGHS) Well, I always follow one rule.

22:11.872 --> 22:15.239
Don't go into a job
without a good plan to get out.

22:15.292 --> 22:19.581
But with my daughter on the line,
I have broken my own rule.

22:19.630 --> 22:21.712
l have no plan.

22:21.757 --> 22:24.590
So, if you wanna turn back...

22:24.718 --> 22:26.219
I'm with you.

22:27.137 --> 22:28.877
Always.

22:28.931 --> 22:30.922
Good.

22:31.058 --> 22:33.470
Well, then let's go save my daughter.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.818
We're almost there.

22:44.947 --> 22:47.108
The book should be just up ahead.

You didn't tell me
those things could attack us.

24:52.658 --> 24:54.740
KILLIAN: I didn't know they could.

24:55.577 --> 24:58.159
Perhaps things are changing
down here, now that Hades is gone.

24:59.164 --> 25:00.540
You sure this book can still work?

25:01.083 --> 25:03.415
I'm not certain of anything down here.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.709
But this book is special.

25:05.754 --> 25:09.997
These pages have crossed realms,
when people needed hope the most.

25:11.760 --> 25:15.423
Out of professional curiosity,
how does one kill the God of Death?

With something called
an Olympian Crystal.

can obliterate anything, even a god.

25:27.568 --> 25:30.605

can find this crystal and use it?
