WEBVTT

00:01.814 --> 00:04.264
What's a more romantic
anniversary getaway,

00:04.289 --> 00:08.138
an Alaskan cruise or a
vampire tour of Arizona?

00:08.164 --> 00:10.877
Duh, a cruise. Cruises are so sexy.

00:10.902 --> 00:12.144
Like on the "Titanic."

00:12.146 --> 00:14.620
But careful, Michelle, or
you might fall in love with

00:14.645 --> 00:16.627
a scoundrel who lives below deck.

00:16.652 --> 00:19.281
Ooh, and he'll wind up dead
while you're floating on a door.

00:19.306 --> 00:20.343
Mmm.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.773
Yeah, I'ma do the vampire tour.

00:22.798 --> 00:26.109
I had a roommate that
I thought was a vampire,

00:26.134 --> 00:27.904
but he was just British.

00:27.929 --> 00:31.749
And then ever since then I've just
roomed with fat, tan Americans.

00:32.786 --> 00:34.685
Ooh, look at the focus.

00:34.710 --> 00:37.026
Ooh, something is definitely up.

00:37.721 --> 00:39.868
Ah, well, nothing, uh, it's just, uh,

00:39.893 --> 00:43.376
it seems that "The Blade's"
Peach Weekender has named me

00:43.401 --> 00:45.611
one of "Toledo's Top 100 Bachelors."

00:45.636 --> 00:47.847
- Hmm.
- Yeah. It's actually kind of embarrassing.

00:47.868 --> 00:50.775
Ladies are gonna be ripping
those sweatpants right off.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.037
Yeah, that drawstring
doesn't stand a chance.

00:53.062 --> 00:55.096
They're gonna tear your
pants off in public.

00:56.262 --> 00:58.993
Oh, what's the word, Durb?

00:59.018 --> 01:01.626
Color me surprised, but guess which

01:01.651 --> 01:04.437
recently divorced high school
principal with a slight case

01:04.462 --> 01:08.617
of psoriasis was just named
one of Toledo's top 100 bachelors?

01:10.858 --> 01:12.724
Thank you. I mean...

01:12.726 --> 01:15.194
- Good for you.
- Move.

01:15.196 --> 01:17.242
Okay, guys... guys, that's very sweet.

01:17.267 --> 01:18.710
You don't need to make a
big fuss out of it, though.

01:18.734 --> 01:21.269
- Yes, there is.
- Oh, glorious day, Whitlock.

01:21.271 --> 01:23.339
Your beloved Principal
has just been named

01:23.364 --> 01:25.722
one of the top 100 bachelors of Toledo.

01:25.747 --> 01:29.010
So, ladies of age, pull up
your bloomers and get in line!

01:30.731 --> 01:33.362

01:44.077 --> 01:45.537
This is so cool.

01:45.562 --> 01:47.288
I mean, who woulda thought
little Ralphie Durbin

01:47.312 --> 01:49.848
from the old neighborhood
being a top Toledo bachelor?

01:49.873 --> 01:52.075
Ralph, take it easy, man.
It's not that big of a deal.

01:52.100 --> 01:54.106
Well, maybe not for you, but
I've never been on a list.

01:54.108 --> 01:57.096
Well, I was... I was on a
sex offender list one time,

01:57.121 --> 01:59.045
but that was a typo.

01:59.047 --> 02:01.747
Guy's name was Ralph Durbine.

02:01.749 --> 02:03.990
- Big time jerky guy, apparently.
- Huh.

02:04.015 --> 02:06.201
I'm just so happy you
and I are on the same list.

02:06.226 --> 02:07.281
- Mm-hmm.
- Now I just gotta worry about

02:07.305 --> 02:09.953
what to do with my face. I hate the
way my face looks in photographs.

02:09.977 --> 02:12.281
What? No. Your face is awesome, Durbs.

02:12.336 --> 02:15.268
Yeah, give us some over
the shoulder brooding look.

02:15.293 --> 02:17.460
- You know, like, make it pouty.
- Okay.

02:20.846 --> 02:23.251
- Yes.
- Yes, Durb, shr-exy.

02:23.276 --> 02:25.384
Okay, God, this is all
so much fun already.

02:25.409 --> 02:26.877
You what the most exciting part is?

02:26.879 --> 02:28.707
After the magazine
comes out, there's a

02:28.732 --> 02:30.796
big party for all the bachelors.

02:30.821 --> 02:34.663
And from what I understand
it is a very swanky affair.

02:34.688 --> 02:35.694
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

02:35.719 --> 02:39.778
Jack, you and I are
gonna be sipping martinis

02:39.803 --> 02:42.560
at the top of the Courtyard Marriott.

02:42.562 --> 02:44.228
Huh.

02:44.230 --> 02:45.834
Yeah, I guess it could
be good for my book on

02:45.858 --> 02:48.999
working class Toledo to
experience their version of a gala.

02:49.001 --> 02:50.735
You ladies think I
look good in sweatpants,

02:50.737 --> 02:52.213
wait till you see me in a suit.

02:52.238 --> 02:54.410
Oh. All right, I'm gonna go to class.

02:54.435 --> 02:56.250
Oh, we should do
matching pocket squares.

02:56.275 --> 02:57.908
I probably won't.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:08.287 --> 03:10.988
Feel like I'm no better at kissing
than I was 20 minutes ago.

03:10.990 --> 03:12.256
I know.

03:12.258 --> 03:13.657
It's way too predictable.

03:13.659 --> 03:15.493
What if we practice
on each other's hands?

03:15.495 --> 03:18.043
Then it's like we're actually
practicing on another person

03:18.068 --> 03:20.868
because we are practicing
on another person.

03:22.802 --> 03:24.502
I'm not so sure.

03:24.504 --> 03:27.638
Don't worry. It's her first time too.

03:40.853 --> 03:42.846
I think we're ready
for actual live girls.

03:42.871 --> 03:44.955
There is a gesture I've
been wanting to make,

03:44.957 --> 03:48.783
but my love... is forbidden.

03:48.808 --> 03:50.674
Okay, let's do it.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.953
I was going for a fist bump,

03:56.978 --> 03:59.278
but I guess you two are well past that.

04:06.646 --> 04:08.512
Whoops, forgive me for interrupting.

04:08.514 --> 04:11.348
I am Sarah Nesbitt,
editor of the top 100 list.

04:11.350 --> 04:12.750
Oh, the top... yeah.

04:12.752 --> 04:14.652
Uh-oh.

04:14.654 --> 04:15.986
All right, guys, pencils down.

04:15.988 --> 04:18.822
Um, we're gonna cool it with
the biology for a second there.

04:18.825 --> 04:20.135
Boy, oh, boy.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.187
I guess I should mention
the no-brainer of the week.

04:22.211 --> 04:26.313
I was, uh, named one of
Toledo's top 100 bachelors.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.122
- Duh.
- Ew.

04:29.147 --> 04:30.601
One hundred?

04:30.603 --> 04:31.702
Yeah.

04:31.727 --> 04:33.460
Actually, I'm here to get a quote

04:33.485 --> 04:36.653
for Ralph Durbin's
profile, since you're his...

04:36.843 --> 04:38.509
"Best friend and former roommate."

04:39.846 --> 04:41.170
All right, well, there's
a startling amount of

04:41.194 --> 04:43.138
hyperbole there, but, uh, yeah, sure.

04:43.163 --> 04:46.784
Uh, go ahead and write
that, uh, he is a good guy

04:46.786 --> 04:48.352
with a... with a kind heart.

04:48.354 --> 04:49.620
And he, uh...

04:49.622 --> 04:54.525
Well, he...

04:55.311 --> 04:57.286
Oh, you know what?
He's not that sex offender

04:57.311 --> 04:58.435
with the very similar name.

04:58.460 --> 04:59.730
He's not him.

04:59.732 --> 05:01.909
Uh, okay.

05:01.934 --> 05:03.534
Well, thank you.

05:03.536 --> 05:05.402
Absolutely. Oh, whoa... before you go...

05:05.404 --> 05:08.091
Um, you know, as you're gathering quotes

05:08.116 --> 05:11.333
for my profile, I prefer that you
get 'em from my Harvard colleagues.

05:11.358 --> 05:14.712
Oh, we only do profiles on
the bachelors who made the top ten.

05:14.714 --> 05:16.714
Oh, oh, ope. I'm sorry?

05:16.716 --> 05:19.426
If you're not in the top
ten, you don't get a profile.

05:19.451 --> 05:22.997
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'm not one of the top ten bachelors?

05:24.156 --> 05:26.156
In Toledo...

05:26.158 --> 05:27.491
Ohio?

05:27.493 --> 05:28.493
Yes.

05:28.494 --> 05:29.960
- What?
- Ouch.

05:34.908 --> 05:35.954
Wait a second.

05:35.979 --> 05:38.655
If you are not gathering
quotes for my profile,

05:38.680 --> 05:40.587
then what is the magazine
gonna say about me?

05:40.612 --> 05:43.015
Oh, we just pull a blurb
from your submission packet.

05:43.017 --> 05:44.517
What submission packet?

05:44.519 --> 05:46.986
Where you were described as a...

05:46.988 --> 05:49.764
"Lovable grumpus" and
the "cutie with a booty."

05:49.789 --> 05:53.258
Now see, I actually agree
with "lovable grumpus."

05:54.162 --> 05:55.328
Thank you, Dan.

05:55.330 --> 05:57.697
All right, those are the ramblings
of a mental patient.

05:57.699 --> 05:59.298
And I know exactly who wrote them.

06:00.690 --> 06:02.312
You can divorce him later.

06:02.337 --> 06:03.669
Oh, shh.

06:03.671 --> 06:05.007
Marry him, he sounds fun.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.928
There's the cutie with the booty.

06:06.953 --> 06:09.555
Helen, I need to know
everything you wrote about me

06:09.580 --> 06:10.697
in that bachelor submission.

06:10.721 --> 06:12.522
- Oh, I was very flattering.
- Yeah?

06:12.547 --> 06:14.289
I said you were a smarty-pants

06:14.314 --> 06:16.297
and you wear really cute pajamas to work

06:16.322 --> 06:18.050
and you live in your
dead mom's apartment.

06:18.052 --> 06:20.553
Okay, so, nothing... nothing
about me going to Harvard

06:20.555 --> 06:22.664
or that I was a National Merit Scholar?

06:22.689 --> 06:24.718
- Yeah.
- Cheez Whiz.

06:24.743 --> 06:25.806
You know what?

06:25.831 --> 06:27.930
I probably shouldn't even
sweat not being in the top ten.

06:27.954 --> 06:29.446
I mean, you know, we
strive for these awards

06:29.470 --> 06:32.231
- that will never bring us true happiness.
- Oh, I can't argue with that.

06:32.233 --> 06:35.668
I mean, being crowned
"The Longest Baby Born in Toledo"

06:35.670 --> 06:38.167
- has caused me nothing but grief.
- Yeah, I bet.

06:38.192 --> 06:39.537
The press can be so mean.

06:39.562 --> 06:42.207
"At this rate, she'll be 11 feet tall.

06:42.232 --> 06:44.617
Finally, an 11-foot tall woman."

06:44.642 --> 06:47.180
And then there's hell to pay
when you end up normal-sized.

06:47.182 --> 06:49.328
I didn't purposely
end up short and squat.

06:49.353 --> 06:51.250
I would have loved to be 11 feet tall.

06:56.224 --> 06:59.058
Yeah, so, Mom, I'm
number eight out of 100.

06:59.060 --> 07:01.260
Yeah, I'm gonna be in the newspaper.

07:04.199 --> 07:07.350
Well, how much... how much
did they drain out of it?

07:07.375 --> 07:08.390
Okay.

07:08.415 --> 07:11.148
I hear "Judge Judy" coming on behind you.
I know you're gonna hang up.

07:11.172 --> 07:13.118
I'll call you later.
I'll call you later, bye.

07:22.183 --> 07:23.916
Watch and learn.

07:28.122 --> 07:30.356
If you're texting me, you don't need to.

07:30.358 --> 07:31.891
I'm right here.

07:31.893 --> 07:33.860
I'm firing my piano teacher.

07:35.363 --> 07:37.718
You know, I always found
the idea of dating childish.

07:37.743 --> 07:38.898
Oh, no.

07:38.900 --> 07:41.031
But as we grow older,
our feelings change.

07:41.056 --> 07:42.905
I look at you and I don't see the girl

07:42.930 --> 07:44.593
I went to elementary
school with anymore.

07:44.618 --> 07:46.806
Now I see a woman.

07:46.808 --> 07:49.742
I don't know if you've noticed,
but I've been changing too.

07:49.744 --> 07:51.978
Uh, Eduardo, uh...

07:51.980 --> 07:54.747
Shh... let me finish.

07:54.749 --> 07:57.149
In conclusion, would you go out with me?

07:57.151 --> 07:58.284
No.

08:00.154 --> 08:01.787
Thank you.

08:04.398 --> 08:06.835
Well, never thought a
high school secretary

08:06.860 --> 08:08.800
in Toledo could be my demise, but...

08:10.364 --> 08:13.942
Oh, Helen's folksy cunning
has pushed me to the brink.

08:13.967 --> 08:15.785
Yeah, she wrote my submission,

08:15.810 --> 08:17.144
which is why I'm not in the top ten.

08:17.168 --> 08:18.306
We gotta fix this.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.010
- We should resubmit your...
- I wanna resubmit my packet

08:20.034 --> 08:23.268
Jesus, Heather, we are lined up.

08:23.497 --> 08:25.332
Once they read the new
packet they'll have no choice

08:25.356 --> 08:27.397
but to put me in the top ten
where I rightfully belong.

08:27.421 --> 08:29.398
Aren't you at all
embarrassed to be groveling

08:29.423 --> 08:32.207
for a spot on a Toledo single's list?

08:32.232 --> 08:34.032
Marcus, face down.

08:35.573 --> 08:37.654
All right, let's get
to work on this blurb.

08:39.582 --> 08:42.284
Uh, maybe use this.

08:43.962 --> 08:47.497
"Once in a generation there's
a revolutionary leader.

08:47.522 --> 08:51.057
A Che, a Mahatma, a Malcolm.

08:51.082 --> 08:54.717
Jack Griffin is the Guevara, the Gandhi,

08:55.071 --> 08:58.372
the Gladwell of Toledo."

08:58.445 --> 09:00.764
Heather...

09:00.789 --> 09:04.335
When I die, you're getting it all.

09:05.729 --> 09:07.229
Say it again.

09:07.254 --> 09:09.387
Sarika, you wanna write this down?

09:11.561 --> 09:14.562
- "Once in a generation..."
- Sarika, write it down.

09:14.587 --> 09:15.883
"Once in a generation..."

09:15.908 --> 09:17.868
Sarika, you're not writing it down.

09:18.318 --> 09:19.484
Mm-hmm.

09:19.509 --> 09:21.008
Are you ready?

09:24.059 --> 09:25.646
Hello, ladies.

09:25.671 --> 09:28.138
- Shouldn't you be in class?
- I have a hall pass.

09:28.619 --> 09:30.302
Okay, see and this is very wet.

09:30.649 --> 09:32.249
May we have the room?

09:32.274 --> 09:33.439
"We" who?

09:33.464 --> 09:34.541
You and me, "we."

09:34.566 --> 09:37.822
Uh, you can have this 5X5 space,

09:37.847 --> 09:41.516
but we will remain in the
room for legal reasons.

09:41.541 --> 09:44.708
Ms. Duncan, if you were a
garden, I would tend you.

09:44.733 --> 09:47.939
- Okay.
- If you were a bird, I would watch you soar.

09:47.964 --> 09:51.374
- Oh, that's nice.
- If you were a video game, I would sneak downstairs

09:51.399 --> 09:53.709
in the middle of the
night to play you on mute.

09:53.734 --> 09:55.985
I don't... I don't like that.

09:56.010 --> 09:57.306
I want you to have this.

09:57.331 --> 09:59.741
Oh, well, see, you are very sweet,

09:59.766 --> 10:03.149
but I can't accept the
Quinn Satchel in Oxblood

10:03.174 --> 10:05.208
with the side-slit pockets.

10:05.233 --> 10:07.152
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm late for French.

10:07.177 --> 10:08.183
Hi.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.477
Give that bag back to
that sweaty little boy.

10:10.502 --> 10:12.569
- Why?
- This is a slippery slope.

10:12.594 --> 10:14.194
- Because he's sweaty?
- Ooh.

10:14.219 --> 10:15.951
Slippin'.

10:15.976 --> 10:17.609
Thank you so much.

10:19.409 --> 10:21.841
Hey, hey there. So glad I caught you.

10:21.866 --> 10:23.600
Uh, this document here is
gonna tell you everything

10:23.624 --> 10:25.208
you really need to know about me, yeah.

10:25.233 --> 10:29.535
SAT scores, Harvard,
my various endowments.

10:30.070 --> 10:32.777
Didn't mean to wink.
That made it skeevy.

10:32.802 --> 10:36.410
Uh, at an rate, I think once
you peruse this document here,

10:36.435 --> 10:38.769
you will see that I am top ten material.

10:38.794 --> 10:40.513
- This isn't necessary.
- No, please.

10:40.538 --> 10:42.300
Okay, uh, we did our research already

10:42.325 --> 10:45.459
and found that you are solidly number...

10:46.933 --> 10:48.065
Okay.

10:50.490 --> 10:52.957
Ah, still flipping?

10:53.908 --> 10:55.474
No.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.342
- 86.
- 86th?

10:57.398 --> 11:00.732
How can I be 86th on
your list? That's crazy.

11:00.757 --> 11:02.979
Hey, Jack. Is everything okay?

11:03.004 --> 11:05.571
Oh, hey... hey,
Lynette. Yeah, it's good.

11:05.596 --> 11:06.662
Yeah, very okay.

11:06.687 --> 11:08.186
What list are you 86th on?

11:08.211 --> 11:09.742
Top 100 Eligible Bachelors...

11:09.767 --> 11:13.068
Golf... golfers, best
golfers of all time.

11:14.105 --> 11:15.404
That's very impressive.

11:15.429 --> 11:17.129
It's... it's not bad.

11:17.154 --> 11:18.785
Okay. Excuse me.

11:18.810 --> 11:21.944
- Don't take the numbers too...
- Can we just... wait a second?

11:26.474 --> 11:27.807
Not yet.

11:27.832 --> 11:29.751
What exactly are we waiting for?

11:29.776 --> 11:32.243
No... nothing, we're just waiting.

11:33.836 --> 11:36.237
86th, are you kidding me?

11:36.262 --> 11:37.941
Don't take the numbers too seriously.

11:37.966 --> 11:40.534
Just being on the list is an honor.

11:40.559 --> 11:41.563
Congrats.

11:41.588 --> 11:44.025
Okay, being 86th on your stupid list

11:44.050 --> 11:45.228
is not an honor.

11:45.253 --> 11:47.319
Great.

11:47.814 --> 11:49.047
That's great.

11:50.657 --> 11:52.995
Are they insane? You're Jack Griffin.

11:53.020 --> 11:54.399
You're Harvard Jack.

11:54.424 --> 11:56.753
You're the big enchilada.
You should be in the top ten.

11:56.766 --> 11:59.767
I mean, come on. How did
they come up with this crazy list?

11:59.769 --> 12:01.803
Oh, they focus on dumb
stuff, like, how I'm always

12:01.805 --> 12:04.373
involved in the community
and how I own a home

12:04.398 --> 12:06.607
and I'm always giving
money to charity and...

12:06.609 --> 12:09.022
How you run the top public
school in the district,

12:09.047 --> 12:11.345
how you give blood till you pass out,

12:11.347 --> 12:14.093
how you put on those little
short-shorts for the car wash

12:14.118 --> 12:16.517
just so we can raise a lot of money
for the women's shelter.

12:16.542 --> 12:18.820
The ladies were going crazy for him.

12:18.845 --> 12:21.355
How are my accomplishments
ever gonna be rewarded,

12:21.357 --> 12:22.957
given those insane parameters?

12:22.959 --> 12:25.387
See, this is wrong.
Damn it, this is wrong.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.474
- It's wrong.
- We gotta fight.

12:26.498 --> 12:29.366
You know, the mayor owes me a favor.

12:29.666 --> 12:33.000
Maybe it's time I called it in.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.735
Yeah, or we could just go talk to Sarah.

12:34.737 --> 12:37.916
I mean, I do think a word
from a top ten would go very far.

12:37.941 --> 12:40.891
Yeah, oh, well, she'll be at the group
photoshoot later this afternoon.

12:40.916 --> 12:43.811
- Perfect.
- You and I are gonna be toasting martinis

12:43.813 --> 12:46.414
as fellow top tenners in no time.

12:46.416 --> 12:48.349
That's the plan.

12:48.351 --> 12:50.418
Hey, why does the mayor owe you a favor?

12:50.420 --> 12:52.720
Oh, well...

12:52.722 --> 12:56.491
Let's just say that his, uh, daughter

12:56.493 --> 13:00.795
did not go to her senior prom alone.

13:06.603 --> 13:08.402
My nephew took her.

13:09.572 --> 13:11.606
Oh... oh.

13:13.042 --> 13:15.510
If you're texting me, you don't need to.

13:15.512 --> 13:17.445
I'm right here.

13:17.447 --> 13:18.793
What are you talking about?

13:18.818 --> 13:21.210
You know, I always found
the idea of dating childish.

13:21.246 --> 13:22.617
Oh, I heard about this.

13:22.619 --> 13:24.685
But as we grow older,
our feelings change.

13:24.687 --> 13:26.587
I look at you and I don't see the girl

13:26.589 --> 13:28.456
I went to elementary
school with anymore.

13:28.458 --> 13:30.525
Now, I see a woman.

13:30.527 --> 13:32.250
That's really sweet,
but let me cut you off.

13:32.275 --> 13:34.128
No, please allow me to cut you off.

13:34.130 --> 13:35.610
Would you go out with me?

13:35.635 --> 13:38.432
Not if we were the last two
people on a desert island.

13:38.434 --> 13:39.901
Thank you.

13:44.140 --> 13:47.975
As an adult, starting swimming is scary.

13:47.977 --> 13:50.711
Oh, no, I know you didn't keep that bag.

13:50.713 --> 13:54.415
Girl, I am trying to teach
the future generation of men

13:54.417 --> 13:55.883
how to treat a lady.

13:55.885 --> 13:57.718
He's gonna expect something.

13:57.720 --> 14:00.175
- Like, an A.
- More like that A.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.019
More like that ass.

14:03.393 --> 14:06.160
Girl. But it makes me feel so classy.

14:06.162 --> 14:07.461
What can I get you?

14:07.463 --> 14:09.730
Oh, no shot for me.

14:09.732 --> 14:13.067
Today I think I'll try a Pinot Grigio.

14:13.069 --> 14:15.937
Huh, thought you'd order
something like that.

14:15.939 --> 14:19.073
See? It's classy.

14:19.075 --> 14:21.676
Okay, think about this:

14:21.678 --> 14:25.012
Victor gives you a bag and
then you feel obliged

14:25.014 --> 14:27.782
to hang out with him after school one day.

14:27.784 --> 14:30.184
And then poof, it's ten years later.

14:30.186 --> 14:32.753
You're married to Victor
living in a two-room condo

14:32.755 --> 14:35.623
with an in-unit washer-dryer,
explaining what 9/11 was like.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.273
Well, do I get a parking space?

14:37.298 --> 14:38.939
- Stefanie.
- W... what?

14:38.964 --> 14:40.828
I mean, he's very thoughtful.

14:40.830 --> 14:42.930
And very 16.

14:42.932 --> 14:45.700
Fine, fine, I will give the bag back.

14:48.538 --> 14:50.605
You guys are being jealous.

14:50.607 --> 14:52.173
Jealous.

14:52.175 --> 14:53.941
That's perfect.

14:53.943 --> 14:55.509
Oh, good, Ralph, you're here.

14:55.511 --> 14:58.817
Grab a hard hat and vest off the table
and go lay next to the rubble.

14:58.842 --> 15:01.024
Listen, let's just pause
the photographs for just a second.

15:01.048 --> 15:02.681
We need to have a serious discussion

15:02.706 --> 15:04.913
about my friend's
placement on this list.

15:05.521 --> 15:07.722
And are those hard hats adjustable?

15:07.724 --> 15:09.991
Listen, I know you weren't
swayed by my new submission

15:09.993 --> 15:12.026
despite the fact that I'm
clearly more qualified...

15:12.028 --> 15:13.728
I already told you we don't
need you for this shoot.

15:13.730 --> 15:14.862
The list has been decided.

15:14.864 --> 15:16.014
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

15:16.039 --> 15:17.965
But if you won't take
it from me, I get it.

15:17.967 --> 15:20.356
Perhaps you'll take it from
your very own number eight.

15:20.381 --> 15:21.483
Ralph, take it away.

15:21.508 --> 15:25.305
Yeah, uh, Jack Griffin is the
finest man I've ever known.

15:25.330 --> 15:28.820
- Wow.
- The fact that he's even a bachelor is a crime.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.711
Now am I twisting his
arm? This is all him.

15:30.713 --> 15:32.546
He should not be in your top ten.

15:32.548 --> 15:35.683
He should be in your top one.

15:35.685 --> 15:37.718
Unless that... is that
your number one guy?

15:37.720 --> 15:39.266
- Because he deserves it.
- Yeah.

15:39.291 --> 15:40.377
That's your number one right there.

15:40.401 --> 15:42.018
- There's your number one.
- Oh, my God, he is handsome.

15:42.042 --> 15:45.180
Look at that guy. Slot me
in at number two, 'cause he's very fit.

15:45.205 --> 15:47.165
- He's fit.
- I'm sorry, I have no time for this.

15:47.190 --> 15:49.424
You know what, um, I think I
can slide in right over here.

15:49.448 --> 15:50.782
I'll sit next to this gentleman here

15:50.806 --> 15:51.948
or if you wouldn't mind hopping up.

15:51.972 --> 15:53.645
That's great. I don't
even need a jacket.

15:53.670 --> 15:55.350
And you know what? It could be a top 11,

15:55.375 --> 15:57.599
- no one's counting.
- Mr. Griffin, you're making me question

15:57.623 --> 15:59.111
whether you should be
on this list at all.

15:59.135 --> 16:01.486
Ooh, you gonna take that
lying down, number eight?

16:01.511 --> 16:02.678
Absolutely not.

16:02.703 --> 16:05.337
Now listen, either we
are both in the top ten,

16:05.362 --> 16:06.728
or we're both out.

16:08.584 --> 16:09.784
Have it your way.

16:09.786 --> 16:11.314
All right, great.

16:11.339 --> 16:12.938
You're both off the list.

16:15.858 --> 16:18.125
Uh... okay.

16:18.127 --> 16:19.894
Well...

16:19.896 --> 16:21.796
Here, can you grab that
for me there, beefcake?

16:21.798 --> 16:25.900
Um, you know what, pal?
We are so much better off.

16:25.902 --> 16:28.769
I'm telling you, this top ten is whack.

16:28.771 --> 16:29.811
It's whack.

16:29.836 --> 16:30.843
Yeah.

16:30.868 --> 16:32.880
- There were two craft brewers on that list.
- Oh.

16:32.905 --> 16:34.937
Two of these guys, they craft beer.
That's all they do.

16:34.961 --> 16:38.112
Right. That's... yeah, I guess, uh...

16:38.114 --> 16:40.715
I guess I shouldn't have,
uh, gotten my hopes up.

16:40.717 --> 16:42.083
Yeah...

16:48.441 --> 16:49.893
It is with a heavy heart

16:49.918 --> 16:53.011
and fist to the justice
raised in the heavens

16:53.036 --> 16:55.935
that I inform you that
your beloved Principal,

16:55.967 --> 16:57.763
Ralph Durbin, is no longer on

16:57.788 --> 17:00.088
Toledo's top 100 bachelors list.

17:00.113 --> 17:01.896
Which is unfair A-F,

17:01.921 --> 17:04.429
and I'm sorry to letter-swear
this early in the morning.

17:04.454 --> 17:07.088
He can't... he's
coming. I gotta go, bye.

17:07.113 --> 17:09.613
Was that really necessary, Helen?

17:12.803 --> 17:14.569
Uh, what else you got?

17:14.594 --> 17:17.094
What about a list of
"Tole-dos and Tole-dont's"?

17:17.118 --> 17:20.788
No, too similar to our
"Ohi-os and Goodbye-os."

17:20.813 --> 17:23.294
Oh, great, this guy's back.

17:23.319 --> 17:24.468
Oh, really?

17:24.492 --> 17:26.304
I'm not the one with
wet tuna on my cleavage.

17:26.329 --> 17:27.929
Yeah, you know what? Nope.

17:27.954 --> 17:29.287
I'm not gonna go there, I'm not.

17:29.312 --> 17:30.478
Because this isn't about you or me.

17:30.502 --> 17:32.469
This is about my good
friend, Ralph Durbin.

17:32.494 --> 17:34.929
Someone who cares enough about
other people to put them first.

17:34.953 --> 17:36.285
Someone who spends his life

17:36.310 --> 17:37.977
making things better for other people.

17:38.002 --> 17:40.638
I honestly cannot think
of a single person on Earth

17:40.663 --> 17:42.334
who's more worthy of
being in your top ten

17:42.346 --> 17:45.247
than that sweet, generous
dumpling of a man,

17:45.249 --> 17:47.916
and I am not leaving this
office until you get that.

17:47.918 --> 17:51.022
Also, I grabbed one of these
croissant sandwiches on the way in.

17:51.047 --> 17:52.923
I hope these are for everybody,
'cause I'm taking one.

17:52.947 --> 17:54.093
It looks delicious.

17:54.118 --> 17:55.547
I haven't had one in a long time.

17:55.572 --> 17:57.087
So, regardless of your
decision on Durbin,

17:57.111 --> 17:59.011
I'm going to eat this.

17:59.263 --> 18:00.962
I hope that's cool.

18:04.194 --> 18:05.426
Victor.

18:07.170 --> 18:09.482
So, I don't know if you
have spring break plans...

18:09.507 --> 18:13.107
You know, Victor, I'm
going to have to return

18:13.132 --> 18:14.676
your really thoughtful gift.

18:14.678 --> 18:18.113
I mean, yes, this supple nubuck leather

18:18.115 --> 18:19.956
is giving me all kinds of feelings,

18:19.981 --> 18:23.118
but... I'm your teacher

18:23.120 --> 18:24.619
and it's inappropriate.

18:24.621 --> 18:25.700
You mean forbidden?

18:25.725 --> 18:28.600
Uh, yes, it's legally forbidden.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.558
But, you know, don't worry about it,

18:30.560 --> 18:33.061
because I am sure the appropriate person

18:33.063 --> 18:34.717
that really deserves this bag

18:34.742 --> 18:36.775
is right around the corner.

18:37.634 --> 18:39.301
So...

18:39.303 --> 18:42.203
Before we go back to the
teacher-student charade,

18:42.205 --> 18:43.738
may I ask for a kiss?

18:59.056 --> 19:03.725
I'm not sure, but I think
don't tell anyone about this.

19:16.868 --> 19:19.702
- Hey, Grace, can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.

19:19.727 --> 19:21.676
If we were the last two
people on a desert island,

19:21.678 --> 19:23.211
would you hook up with me?

19:23.213 --> 19:24.546
Yeah, I guess so.

19:24.548 --> 19:26.181
Whoa.

19:26.183 --> 19:28.416
What if we went to prom together

19:28.418 --> 19:30.385
and I showed you the night of your life?

19:30.387 --> 19:33.021
And afterwards we went
to my uncle's lake house,

19:33.023 --> 19:34.289
would you do it then?

19:34.291 --> 19:35.724
Yeah.

19:35.726 --> 19:38.593
What about just, like,
at my house after school?

19:38.595 --> 19:40.462
- Okay.
- I'm busy today.

19:40.464 --> 19:42.097
Another time then.

19:47.104 --> 19:50.372
Jack, thank you for arguing
me back on to the list.

19:50.374 --> 19:51.773
To making this night happen.

19:51.775 --> 19:53.111
This is so great.

19:53.136 --> 19:55.610
This is... I'm just so glad
we can experience it together.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.278
Yeah, I am too, Ralph.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.080
But, you know, hey, you earned it.

19:59.082 --> 20:00.615
See, this is exactly what I wanted,

20:00.617 --> 20:03.051
sharing a fancy cocktail with my buddy.

20:03.053 --> 20:06.058
Hey, you know, the, uh, philosopher
Camus, said of friendship...

20:06.083 --> 20:08.723
Hey, two rum and cokes.

20:08.725 --> 20:10.291
Yep.

20:11.595 --> 20:13.395
I'm sorry you had to be a volunteer

20:13.397 --> 20:15.130
to get me back in the top ten, Jack.

20:15.132 --> 20:18.133
Don't mention it. It's
the least I could do.

20:18.135 --> 20:19.893
Uh, let's see, what was I saying?

20:19.918 --> 20:22.237
Oh, yes, um, the philosopher
Camus, said that...

20:22.239 --> 20:23.805
- Ooh.
- Friendship, essentially...

20:23.807 --> 20:25.640
Can I get a little more ice in this one?

20:25.642 --> 20:27.642
Yeah.

20:27.644 --> 20:29.577
Ooh, look at that.

20:30.847 --> 20:32.414
It's not really a fight.

20:32.416 --> 20:35.450
There we go. How am I doing?

20:35.452 --> 20:38.353
- It's perfect, good job.
- Thank you.

20:38.355 --> 20:40.422
God, did you ever think
when you were younger

20:40.424 --> 20:42.757
that someday you'd be with your buddy,

20:42.759 --> 20:46.594
having a fancy drink
because the people in Toledo

20:46.596 --> 20:48.296
voted you "sexy?"

20:48.298 --> 20:49.597
Definitely not.

20:49.599 --> 20:52.300
It's a pretty special night.

20:54.871 --> 20:56.471
I'm glad.

21:00.277 --> 21:01.609
Wow, the wind is blowing east,

21:01.611 --> 21:03.323
but you can still smell
the rendering plant.

21:04.488 --> 21:05.521
Yep.
