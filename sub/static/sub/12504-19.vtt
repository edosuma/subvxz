00:05.273 --> 00:07.308
[Payson] Previously on
Make It Or Break It:

00:07.341 --> 00:09.177
I'm not working your tails off
because you didn't go to China.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.811
I'm working them off
because China's coming here,

00:10.844 --> 00:14.048
- to The Rock.
- Yeah, I walked away
from a lot of money

00:14.082 --> 00:17.318
to do my music my way.
You're not supposed to work,
but you have a job.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.320
You're not supposed to have
a boyfriend, but here we are.

00:19.353 --> 00:23.057
You committed adultery,
and now our whole family
is falling apart.

00:23.091 --> 00:26.427
We're not falling apart.
Your father just
needs some time.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.529
- Truce?
- Truce.

00:31.632 --> 00:34.802
[answering machine] This is
Payson's physical therapist.
I haven't heard from Payson

00:34.835 --> 00:39.039
and it's been a week since
I gave her the go-ahead to
start training again. Thanks.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.143
[Lauren] China was hell.

00:42.176 --> 00:44.545
I have never come
in last on beam. Never.

00:44.578 --> 00:47.348
[Kaylie] You're
better than that, Lo.
We all know it.

00:47.381 --> 00:51.352
[Lauren] It was brutal.
Not one girl on the
National Team cheered for me.

00:51.385 --> 00:55.089
No one roomed with me.
I was totally iced out.

00:55.123 --> 00:58.226
I mean, no excuses,
but we talk all the time

00:58.259 --> 01:01.429
about how important it is
to have your team around you,
to support you.

01:01.462 --> 01:04.465
- It is important. For real.
- I tried to hold it together,

01:04.498 --> 01:07.368
to focus, but I choked.

01:07.401 --> 01:11.539
You know, it was the
first major meet I've
been to without you guys.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.474
- [Payson] Is that true?
- Think about it.

01:13.507 --> 01:16.110
Kay and I've been on the
same team since we were eight,

01:16.144 --> 01:18.512
and Payson moved
to Boulder when we were 12.

01:18.546 --> 01:22.516
Remember our first meet?
You landed your Tsukahara

01:22.550 --> 01:25.553
- and barfed all over the mat.
- [laughing]

01:25.586 --> 01:27.621
OK, I was a little nervous.

01:27.655 --> 01:30.224
But at least I didn't
lose one-tenth of a point

01:30.258 --> 01:33.227
for picking my leo out
of my butt crack
while doing my beam routine.

01:33.261 --> 01:36.430
- I can't believe I did that.
- All right, Payson. Give it up.

01:36.464 --> 01:39.533
- What's your most
embarrassing moment?
- There isn't one.

01:39.567 --> 01:42.136
- I was perfect.
- [scoffs]

01:42.170 --> 01:45.473
- Right. [laughs]
- OK, not exactly perfect.

01:45.506 --> 01:50.178
Uh, back in Minnesota,
at my first junior meet,

01:50.211 --> 01:52.280
I was so nervous
I peed a little in my leo.

01:52.313 --> 01:55.216
- [laughing]
- I thought the team would never

01:55.249 --> 01:59.153
- stop calling me
Pee-son Keeler. Awful!
- [laughter]

02:00.688 --> 02:02.623
You know,
we moved around so much,

02:02.656 --> 02:05.559
I don't think any old teammates
would even remember me.

02:05.593 --> 02:07.127
[light clicks on]

02:09.663 --> 02:11.432
This is not a pajama party.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.302
You have only been
on lockdown for six days.

02:14.335 --> 02:17.571
The Chinese gymnasts
live like this every single day

02:17.605 --> 02:19.440
of their regimented
little lives.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.243
They're plucked
from their homes, sent away,
locked in a camp,

02:22.276 --> 02:24.545
they live, breathe,
eat and sleep gymnastics.

02:24.578 --> 02:27.315
They are pushed
beyond all rational limits

02:27.348 --> 02:30.584
until they become
perfectly calibrated machines.

02:30.618 --> 02:34.522
In four days, that machine
will arrive here to face you.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.657
So are you gonna
gossip and giggle?
Or do you think perhaps

02:36.690 --> 02:39.593
you should zip it up
and try to get some sleep?

02:42.596 --> 02:46.234
Silence. Music to my ears.

02:50.371 --> 02:52.606
Thanks again
for chaperoning this week.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.642
Whatever it takes to beat China.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.513
Nice PJs, by the way.

03:02.450 --> 03:05.719
Um... yeah. Today's calls.

03:05.753 --> 03:08.756
Um... yeah. The sports
press are going crazy,

03:08.789 --> 03:12.560
everybody wants interviews.
But most of these
are from Ellen Beals

03:12.593 --> 03:14.495
at the National
Gymnastics Committee.

03:14.528 --> 03:17.631
"Please return." "Urgent."
"Very, very urgent."

03:17.665 --> 03:19.600
"You better
'blank blank' call me."

03:19.633 --> 03:22.403
This is a club meet,
so it's none of her concern.

03:25.473 --> 03:28.509
- I'm gonna miss
waking up to you.
- Cute.

03:28.542 --> 03:33.247
We've kept this
completely professional
for these past six days.

03:33.281 --> 03:35.583
And I hardly think this is
the time to let our guard down,

03:35.616 --> 03:38.519
especially with the girls
sleeping right outside the door.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.820
Spoken like a true chaperone.

03:43.691 --> 03:44.625
Sleep well.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.541
So you were dating
the nice brunette one,

04:00.574 --> 04:02.676
and then you hooked up
with the bossy blonde one,

04:02.710 --> 04:06.280
but now you're back
with the first one.

04:06.314 --> 04:08.749
- Yeah.
- Impressive work, cowboy.

04:08.782 --> 04:13.621
I knew Kaylie and I
would end up together
if I just... waited it out.

04:13.654 --> 04:18.626
- I don't know
how you hung in there.
- I'm used to it.

04:18.659 --> 04:22.296
Kaylie and I were together
for over a year, nobody knew.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.665
Not our teammates,
not our friends,

04:24.698 --> 04:27.835
not her dad,
who would've killed us.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.603
Our whole relationship
was underground.

04:29.637 --> 04:31.772
I just can't get my
head around that.

04:31.805 --> 04:34.675
Well, you better start if you
want to be with a Rock girl.

04:34.708 --> 04:38.412
You've got to realize you can't
have a "normal" relationship.

04:38.446 --> 04:39.480
Yeah.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.386
Wouldn't you just love
to be a fly on the wall
at that lockdown?

04:45.419 --> 04:47.621
That is my idea of hell.

04:47.655 --> 04:50.458
All the chatter and gossip?

04:50.491 --> 04:52.460
I bet you Kaylie is telling
all the girls right now

04:52.493 --> 04:55.095
- about your sudsy little
make-out session.
- Oh, crap.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.831
- All the girls including...
- The bossy blonde one.

05:00.734 --> 05:03.804
- Kay, you awake?
- Yeah.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.808
No matter what's
gone down between us,

05:07.841 --> 05:10.411
I will always
need you, Kaylie.

05:10.444 --> 05:13.447
You're not just my teammate.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.483
You're like
the sister I never had.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.818
I know.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.420
You, too.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.923
Let's never let a guy
come between us again.

05:25.593 --> 05:28.729
I promise. Never again.

05:30.130 --> 05:31.532
OK.

06:00.628 --> 06:02.530
In three days,
we go up against China.

06:02.563 --> 06:05.165
They are considered to be
the best team in the world.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.468
Who is the strongest girl
on the Chinese team, Kaylie?

06:07.501 --> 06:10.538
- Genji Cho.
- That little 13-year-old
is a freak of nature.

06:10.571 --> 06:13.707
Genji Cho scored
every single gold medal
in the meet against the U.S.

06:13.741 --> 06:16.877
The Chinese won eight medals.
How many medals
did the U.S. team win?

06:16.910 --> 06:18.646
- Emily?
- Four medals.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.781
Four.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.683
We want to beat
the Chinese team.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.486
But we must do better than the
U.S. team to make our point.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.655
And we will.

06:27.688 --> 06:30.724
This is the last
practice of lockdown, so...

06:30.758 --> 06:32.426
Show me what you got.

06:32.460 --> 06:35.729
[rock music plays]

06:46.607 --> 06:49.910
* I wanna know what's in you

06:49.943 --> 06:53.581
* I wanna see the show

06:53.614 --> 06:57.651
* I wanna turn it into

06:57.685 --> 07:01.589
* Something that you
never wanna let go *

07:01.622 --> 07:04.558
* Too tired to fight it *

07:08.629 --> 07:11.198
I can't spot my feet
on the blind landing.
It's freaking me out.

07:11.231 --> 07:14.201
Your DOD drops considerably
without that blind landing,
Emily.

07:14.234 --> 07:17.437
- You'll have it by competition.
- If I don't?

07:18.238 --> 07:19.573
Yeah, I know.

07:19.607 --> 07:20.674
Failure is not an option.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.976
Sasha? Bad news.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.012
Don't tell me.
Another call from Beals?

07:25.045 --> 07:26.780
No, that would be good news.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.521
[Beals] Because you chose
not to return my calls,

07:33.554 --> 07:36.223
I had to catch
a last-minute flight.
In coach.

07:36.256 --> 07:39.593
Do you have any idea how
aggravated I am right now?

07:39.627 --> 07:41.929
Is there a point to this?
I have a meet to train for.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.698
My point is you are sending
your girls to slaughter.

07:44.732 --> 07:46.967
The Chinese beat a better team,
the one we assembled.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.769
And because
you've all gone rogue,

07:48.802 --> 07:51.672
not only will your girls
get their asses handed
to them by China,

07:51.705 --> 07:53.841
they may even get
kicked off the National Team.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.943
Thanks to your politics, they're
as good as kicked off already.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.878
So I really don't think
they've got anything to lose.

07:57.911 --> 07:58.979
That's where
you're wrong, Belov.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.782
You're setting them up
to lose it all.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.685
- And I'm not going to let you.
- There's nothing
you can do about it.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.820
We'll see about that.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.064
Emily.

08:17.097 --> 08:19.667
Ellen Beals
with National Committee.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.068
I know who you are.

08:22.703 --> 08:26.674
You know we keep a close eye
on our scholarship athletes.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.777
Everything OK
with your family?

08:29.810 --> 08:32.746
We're doing fine, thank you.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.548
That's good to hear.

08:34.582 --> 08:35.949
You're managing financially?

08:35.983 --> 08:38.752
We're doing OK right now.

08:38.786 --> 08:42.956
And you're following
all the rules, keeping up
with your schoolwork? Good.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.758
We're very
proud of you, Emily.

08:44.792 --> 08:47.995
And we don't want anything
to get in the way
of our partnership.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.074
What did Beals want? Everyone
could tell she was pissed.

09:01.108 --> 09:03.744
And it's your job as the team
leader to stop your teammates

09:03.777 --> 09:06.814
wondering about Ellen Beals
and focus on winning.

09:06.847 --> 09:09.082
- Right. Sorry.
- Kaylie.

09:09.116 --> 09:12.953
I've been especially proud
of you these past seven days.

09:12.986 --> 09:16.724
- You're becoming a leader.
- Thank you.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.659
Don't thank me.
Prove me right.

09:18.692 --> 09:20.928
You're about to go back
out into the real world.

09:20.961 --> 09:23.831
I need you to keep your
team focused on this meet.
Are you up for that?

09:23.864 --> 09:26.734
- Yes, sir.
- OK.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.906
I'll be happy to sleep
in my own bed tonight.

09:32.940 --> 09:36.376
Yeah, but it's been nice
taking a break from
all the drama out there.

09:36.409 --> 09:40.681
- Tell me about it.
- The world has been on hold
for the past seven days,

09:40.714 --> 09:43.383
and now it's right
outside that door, waiting.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.687
So let's make a pact.
If any of us feels like
we're freaking out,

09:46.720 --> 09:48.622
you make a call
to one of your teammates.

09:48.656 --> 09:50.057
We're gonna stand
by each other.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.759
We're gonna stay focused.

09:51.792 --> 09:55.863
And three days from now,
we're going to shock the world.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.731
So let's do it.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.869
- One, two, three.
- [all] Rock on!

10:12.079 --> 10:14.648
Hello, stranger.

10:14.682 --> 10:16.884
I'm beginning to think
you're blowing me off.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.988
Steve, the truth is
I have been avoiding you.

10:21.021 --> 10:25.225
I think it's best
if we stop dating.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.696
I was hoping you
were just busy.

10:28.729 --> 10:32.099
- I'm thinking of the girls.
- Wait.

10:32.132 --> 10:36.203
We have a lot of fun together.
What's so wrong with that?

10:36.236 --> 10:38.105
Please, don't.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.710
[indistinct chatter]

10:45.445 --> 10:49.216
So how many gifts do you
think my dad has given your mom
since we've been in here?

10:49.249 --> 10:52.786
As far as I know,
my mother came to her senses
and broke up with your dad.

10:52.820 --> 10:55.723
I doubt it. Money talks,
especially to poor people.

10:55.756 --> 10:58.759
I highly doubt your mom
would let go of my dad.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.861
I have a feeling she just did.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.937
How did it go with Payson?
How was the training?

11:09.970 --> 11:12.740
She's not training.
Just conditioning.

11:12.773 --> 11:16.243
I'm sure she's chomping
at the bit to get the OK
to return to her gymnastics.

11:16.276 --> 11:19.713
She got the OK two weeks ago.

11:19.747 --> 11:22.783
- Then why isn't she...?
- [whispers] She
doesn't know I know.

11:22.816 --> 11:26.053
- You should've told me.
- If she wasn't ready,
I didn't want to push it.

11:26.086 --> 11:29.089
And I guess I thought
spending a whole week in here

11:29.122 --> 11:32.826
would be what she needed
to get over her fears.

11:32.860 --> 11:35.796
- I'll talk to her.
- No, no. Um...

11:35.829 --> 11:39.166
If you don't mind, let me
have a shot at handling this.

11:45.505 --> 11:48.742
[Sasha] Payson, can I have a
word with you before you go?

11:48.776 --> 11:50.143
Oh, yeah, sure.

11:53.046 --> 11:57.751
I wanted you to join us on this
lockdown because your presence
brings a lot to this team.

11:57.785 --> 12:00.120
Thank you.

12:00.153 --> 12:03.523
Do you know why the
Chinese team is so powerful?

12:03.556 --> 12:05.058
Because they
work them so hard.

12:05.092 --> 12:08.762
It's because they start
training before they know
how to be afraid of failure.

12:08.796 --> 12:13.000
Fear can be as crippling
as an injury to any gymnast.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.301
Which is why I'm concerned...

12:16.336 --> 12:19.506
...about Emily.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.942
- Emily?
- She's letting
her fear stop her

12:21.975 --> 12:23.977
from nailing the blind landing
on her Yurchenko.

12:24.011 --> 12:26.546
You've just
faced your worst fear

12:26.579 --> 12:29.850
and you're ready
to come back, right?

12:29.883 --> 12:32.052
- As soon as they let me.
- Excellent.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.287
That's the kind of
fearlessness Emily needs.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.523
I want you to work with her.

12:36.556 --> 12:39.126
I think you're the one that
could help her nail that vault.

12:39.159 --> 12:40.894
Can you do that for me?

12:42.329 --> 12:46.099
She'll be sticking
that blind landing
by the end of practice tomorrow.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.001
That's what I wanted to hear.

13:00.313 --> 13:03.250
I'm back! Did you miss me?

13:03.283 --> 13:06.286
- You're in a good mood.
- Well, I'm happy
to be out of the gym,

13:06.319 --> 13:08.989
I'm psyched to have a rematch
with that freak Genji Cho

13:09.022 --> 13:13.593
and... I'm even
glad to see you.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.129
Kaylie didn't tell you.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.833
That's good. Uh...

13:19.867 --> 13:23.270
- I wanted to talk to you first.
- About what?

13:25.638 --> 13:28.008
Kaylie and I
are back together.

13:30.610 --> 13:33.246
- You're back together?
- Well...

13:34.614 --> 13:35.815
We kissed.

13:37.885 --> 13:39.853
Really?

13:39.887 --> 13:43.223
How exactly did you two
wind up, uh, locking lips?

13:43.256 --> 13:46.860
It just... sort of happened.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.395
I'd just about given up.

13:48.428 --> 13:51.899
But I guess she finally
decided to forgive me.

13:51.932 --> 13:56.169
I just can't believe we've been
in the gym together for a week

13:56.203 --> 13:59.940
- and she didn't say anything.
- Maybe she didn't think
you'd want to hear about it.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.976
It's sort of a sore
subject for you guys.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.277
[laughs]

14:10.683 --> 14:12.419
- [murmuring]
- What?

14:12.452 --> 14:13.887
Force field.

14:13.921 --> 14:15.622
I can feel it from here.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.891
Power. Agility. Perfection.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.893
You went into lockdown
as Emily Kmetko,

14:19.927 --> 14:22.129
but you came out
with superpowers.
Look out, everybody.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.898
- She could knock you over
with her little finger.
- Are those my potato fingers?

14:24.932 --> 14:27.434
Dude, don't get her mad.
She will decimate you,

14:27.467 --> 14:30.637
like she's gonna do
to those Chinese girls.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.305
Here you go, sir.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.908
So how did you
spend your week?

14:34.942 --> 14:37.677
Actually, I spent it laying
down some tracks of my songs.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.247
- Really?
- Yeah. It felt good.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.349
What are you
gonna do with them?

14:42.382 --> 14:47.420
I, uh, sent them to this new
music contest NPR is doing.

14:47.454 --> 14:51.158
That's great. [chuckles]
I'm really proud of you.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.460
Easy, superpower-girl.
It's a long shot.

14:53.493 --> 14:57.697
Yeah, well, that's what they
told me about Nationals.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.467
So, what's the prize?

15:00.500 --> 15:05.205
- To open for Green Day's
European tour.
- That's amazing!

15:05.238 --> 15:07.240
[laughs]

15:07.274 --> 15:10.944
Doesn't that mean you're gonna
have to sing your own songs?

15:10.978 --> 15:13.713
In front of people?

15:13.746 --> 15:15.949
There's no chance in hell
I'm gonna win, Emily.

15:15.983 --> 15:20.487
I just wanted to get
things started, you know?
Take a step.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.525
I'm still really proud of you.

15:27.327 --> 15:28.428
Hear that?

15:28.461 --> 15:31.999
Superpower-girl
is proud of me.

15:36.003 --> 15:38.105
[girls giggling]

15:38.138 --> 15:41.141
- What was I thinking
with that neon green leo?
- That was mine.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.709
Remember, we used
to share leos.

15:42.742 --> 15:45.478
Yeah, we used
to share everything.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.083
Speaking of sharing...

15:53.086 --> 15:55.488
There's something
I haven't told you.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.097
My dad's dating Chloe Kmetko.

16:04.131 --> 16:06.466
- What?
- I know.

16:06.499 --> 16:10.337
Emily told me her mom's
gonna blow it off, but
how can you believe that, right?

16:11.538 --> 16:13.740
- You OK?
- Yeah.

16:13.773 --> 16:16.776
I think the hardest part
is that my dad kept it
a secret, you know?

16:16.809 --> 16:22.049
Yeah, I'm sure. Look,
you gotta get it out of your
mind till after the competition.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.051
You heard Sasha.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.553
Right now, we gotta focus
on beating Genji Cho.

16:26.586 --> 16:30.090
Guess I just needed
someone to talk to.

16:30.123 --> 16:32.492
You said we could lean on
each other if we needed to.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.027
- Yeah.
- I'm sure you'd tell me

16:34.061 --> 16:35.462
if there was something
big going on with you.

16:35.495 --> 16:39.532
- [phone rings]
- Can you pass that to me?

16:39.566 --> 16:41.034
It's Carter.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.271
Something you want to tell me?

16:48.541 --> 16:50.210
Um...

16:52.612 --> 16:54.581
We sort of made up.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.152
All those nights in the gym
together and you didn't tell me?

16:59.186 --> 17:01.521
I'm sorry, I...
I guess...

17:03.490 --> 17:05.458
I'm just having
a hard time trusting you.

17:05.492 --> 17:09.829
At least when it comes
to Carter, you know?

17:09.862 --> 17:12.599
Look, from here on out,

17:12.632 --> 17:14.301
I'm keeping the promise
I made last night.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.836
You are too important to me,

17:16.869 --> 17:19.539
and I will never let a guy
come between us again.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.610
I mean it.
You can trust me, Kay.

17:23.643 --> 17:26.813
And you can
trust Carter, too.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.282
[phone rings]

17:32.585 --> 17:34.621
It's my dad.
He wants me home.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.625
MJ is downstairs.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.261
She says she needs to
discuss the meet with China.

17:41.294 --> 17:44.164
MJ? She never told me
she was coming to town.

17:47.534 --> 17:50.403
- Hey. What's going on?
- I don't mean
to scare you, Kaylie,

17:50.437 --> 17:53.473
but the National Committee is up
in arms over this Invitational.

17:53.506 --> 17:56.509
Yeah. I guess that's
why Ellen Beals showed up
at The Rock this morning.

17:56.543 --> 17:59.312
She came to shut
this thing down.
And she sent me to talk to you.

17:59.346 --> 18:01.481
No, they can't shut this down.

18:01.514 --> 18:04.351
We need to prove ourselves,
to save our careers.

18:04.384 --> 18:07.520
I want you to
consider withdrawing
from this competition.

18:07.554 --> 18:10.290
Withdrawing? MJ, I...
I'm sorry, I can't.

18:10.323 --> 18:13.193
My team is counting
on me to help them win this.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.295
I mean, I'm the leader now.

18:15.328 --> 18:17.397
I understand you don't want
to desert your friends.

18:17.430 --> 18:20.400
But none of them,
not Lauren, not Emily,
certainly not Payson,

18:20.433 --> 18:25.138
who isn't even competing, have
as much on the line as you do.
You're the national champion.

18:25.172 --> 18:27.574
Sure, you didn't go to China,
but you still have your title.

18:27.607 --> 18:31.178
Not to mention, partnerships
and endorsements that
could all be lost.

18:31.211 --> 18:35.682
- Do any of those
girls have that?
- Uh, no.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.586
It's easy to say you
should stick by a team.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.422
But at the end of the day,
this is an individual sport.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.657
Lauren needs a rematch because
she lost to everyone in China.

18:44.691 --> 18:47.294
Emily desperately needs
to prove she's for real.

18:47.327 --> 18:50.163
They both will
only gain from this.

18:50.197 --> 18:52.532
You're the one
with everything to lose.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.669
OK, explain it to me again.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.206
I can understand running
down the vault track

18:59.239 --> 19:02.609
- and hopping onto the thing.
- It's called a punch,

19:02.642 --> 19:04.377
- onto the springboard.
- Right.

19:04.411 --> 19:05.712
But you don't do that.

19:05.745 --> 19:09.449
You dive face forward
into the flippity thing.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.550
Round-off.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.954
And punch...

19:14.987 --> 19:18.191
...onto the springboard.
And that's not the scary part?

19:18.225 --> 19:21.361
No, I'm OK with that.

19:22.995 --> 19:26.199
In a weird way, the best
thing about the Yurchenko

19:26.233 --> 19:30.203
is you're into the move before
you have time to think about it.

19:30.237 --> 19:31.738
But then you think about it.

19:31.771 --> 19:35.375
[sighs] It's the blind landing.

19:35.408 --> 19:38.511
With the entry, the round-off,

19:38.545 --> 19:41.648
I'm facing forward,
so I can see where I'm going.

19:41.681 --> 19:46.219
But I just can't stand
the idea of flying blind

19:46.253 --> 19:48.521
and not seeing
where I'm gonna land.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.690
And everyone's
counting on me to do it.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.560
Look,

19:53.593 --> 19:57.264
I know you felt like you
were flying blind with me.

19:57.297 --> 19:58.798
I'm sorry.

20:03.503 --> 20:06.639
And I'm sorry for not
believing you about jail.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.811
I knew, deep down, that you
didn't do anything wrong, but...

20:14.614 --> 20:16.649
...I just freaked out when
you disappeared, you know?

20:16.683 --> 20:20.253
Yeah, it looked bad.
That was my fault.

20:20.287 --> 20:23.690
But... I promise...

20:24.824 --> 20:27.560
I promise it will
never happen again.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.563
I want to take care
of you, Emily.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.532
I want to be there for you.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.735
I want to come to your
Invitational and cheer for you.
Just...

20:38.438 --> 20:39.772
Let me back in.

20:39.806 --> 20:41.674
It's so hard for me.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.710
It's hard for me, too.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.546
Ridiculously hard.
You think I've ever

20:46.579 --> 20:48.781
felt like this before?
You think I've been in love?

20:53.653 --> 20:55.455
Been in love before?

20:57.724 --> 20:58.858
I love you, too.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.474
[doorbell rings]

21:16.343 --> 21:17.577
I have something
for Mrs. Cruz.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.579
I'm Mrs. Cruz.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.349
- Do I need to sign for this?
- No, ma'am.

21:33.593 --> 21:36.529
- What is it?
- It's...

21:36.563 --> 21:38.365
It's from an attorney.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.569
Your father's
filing for divorce.

21:46.606 --> 21:47.674
Oh, my God.

21:47.707 --> 21:50.477
I just was hoping
he'd forgive me.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.445
[sobbing] I just...

21:52.479 --> 21:53.513
I just thought...

21:53.546 --> 21:55.715
I thought that...

22:13.766 --> 22:16.403
- Where is she?
- Who knows?

22:17.470 --> 22:18.771
Kaylie still isn't here?

22:18.805 --> 22:21.408
You saw her last night.
Did she say anything
about coming in late?

22:21.441 --> 22:22.909
No. She seemed fine.

22:22.942 --> 22:25.645
But she did get
a surprise visit from MJ.

22:25.678 --> 22:28.381
Hm. I wonder
what she said to her.

22:28.415 --> 22:30.149
This is a gym,
not a discotheque, ladies.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.918
I want less gossip
and more sweating, please.

22:31.951 --> 22:35.388
- Have you heard from Kaylie?
- She's just running late.

22:35.422 --> 22:37.724
- She'll walk in
the door any second.
- Running late?

22:37.757 --> 22:41.394
- It's almost ten.
- I'm sure she has a perfectly
reasonable explanation

22:41.428 --> 22:42.929
for her tardiness.
And it's none of your business!

22:42.962 --> 22:44.831
So back to work.

22:49.636 --> 22:51.738
I needed to see you.

22:53.806 --> 22:57.744
Um... sorry, it's
kind of a mess in here.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.586
Are you really divorcing Mom?

23:06.619 --> 23:08.555
I know it's hard for you,

23:08.588 --> 23:12.425
but it's really
between your mother and me.

23:12.459 --> 23:15.595
I want you
to come home, Dad.

23:15.628 --> 23:17.764
I really need you right now.

23:17.797 --> 23:20.467
Kaylie, I'm sorry.
I've been a crappy father.

23:20.500 --> 23:23.870
But I feel like my guts
have been ripped out.

23:25.872 --> 23:28.975
Your, uh, mom cheated on me

23:29.008 --> 23:32.612
with a man I trusted
with my most precious thing.

23:32.645 --> 23:36.215
You. And the whole
world knew about it.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.750
For months.
You knew about it.

23:37.784 --> 23:39.452
I know.

23:39.486 --> 23:41.554
I know, and it killed me.

23:41.588 --> 23:42.855
It did.

23:42.889 --> 23:45.592
I'm so sorry
that I didn't tell you.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.760
I shouldn't have said that.

23:47.794 --> 23:50.730
It's not your responsibility.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.599
You were just stuck
in the middle, Kaylie.

23:56.736 --> 23:58.738
I'm also sorry
I'm not one of those dads

23:58.771 --> 24:01.741
that can put on a brave face and
pretend like nothing happened.

24:01.774 --> 24:05.011
Yeah, but The Rock is having
this big meet with China.

24:05.044 --> 24:07.814
And MJ has pretty much told me
that if I compete in it,

24:07.847 --> 24:11.484
then I'm basically
forfeiting my title
as the national champion.

24:11.518 --> 24:13.586
You fired me as your manager
because you didn't think

24:13.620 --> 24:15.955
I was the best person
to advise you on your career.

24:17.924 --> 24:20.026
And you were
probably right.

24:20.059 --> 24:24.664
This situation has made me
look back at the way I've
handled a lot of things.

24:24.697 --> 24:27.634
Your gymnastics,
my own sports career,

24:27.667 --> 24:30.002
my family.
And to tell you the truth,

24:30.036 --> 24:32.872
I don't have
a whole lot of faith
in my judgment these days.

24:36.643 --> 24:37.644
Right.

24:39.278 --> 24:41.548
I guess I shouldn't
have come here.

24:43.550 --> 24:44.784
If you want my advice...

24:46.285 --> 24:47.286
I do.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.055
Take care of number one.

24:49.088 --> 24:51.724
That's what I'm doing.

24:51.758 --> 24:54.827
At the end of the day,
it's all you can count on.

25:00.733 --> 25:02.802
Kaylie!

25:02.835 --> 25:06.272
Of course I advised
Kaylie not to compete.
It's my job to save her career.

25:06.305 --> 25:08.808
No, it's your job
to put her face on cereal
boxes and sports drinks,

25:08.841 --> 25:12.612
not scare her out of
competitions. The National
Committee is so terrified

25:12.645 --> 25:14.080
we're gonna do better against
China than the National Team

25:14.113 --> 25:17.684
- and expose
their ludicrous cronyism.
- This is all about your ego.

25:17.717 --> 25:20.720
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Oh, Sasha, it's me.
I know you.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.689
You've always hated the
gymnastics establishment,

25:22.722 --> 25:24.757
ever since they ran
you out of your last job.

25:24.791 --> 25:27.059
And now, you're using Kaylie to
wage your own personal vendetta

25:27.093 --> 25:29.796
against the committee
for not choosing you
to coach the National Team.

25:29.829 --> 25:33.065
If that's what you think,
you don't know me at all.
This is all about Kaylie.

25:33.099 --> 25:36.803
A national champion should be
allowed to represent her country
in international events.

25:36.836 --> 25:40.573
That's exactly my point.
Your club meet is not
a committee-sanctioned event.

25:40.607 --> 25:43.009
And Kaylie has smartly
chosen to pull herself
from the competition.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.343
She told you
she's pulling out?

25:44.376 --> 25:47.780
No, but it's clear
from her absence that's
the decision she's made.

25:47.814 --> 25:49.916
I'll believe it
when I hear it from Kaylie.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.860
Well, that doesn't look good.

26:00.893 --> 26:04.597
MJ is convincing Kaylie
to protect her ass.

26:04.631 --> 26:09.168
You don't really think Kaylie
would bail on the meet just
to keep her endorsement deals?

26:10.770 --> 26:13.640
Kaylie wouldn't
bail on us, would she?

26:13.673 --> 26:15.775
We can't do this without her.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.153
Put the Kaylie stuff
out of your head.

26:27.186 --> 26:29.789
Now, more than ever,
you need to ace this vault.

26:29.822 --> 26:31.924
[rock music plays]

26:35.762 --> 26:36.763
[grunts]

26:37.764 --> 26:39.832
- I'm not gonna get it in time!
- Yes, you will.

26:39.866 --> 26:42.635
It's OK. You got this.

26:44.837 --> 26:46.673
[grunts]

26:48.675 --> 26:49.776
[grunts]

26:51.110 --> 26:53.713
Say to yourself, Emily,
I know exactly

26:53.746 --> 26:56.382
- where I'm gonna land.
- I know exactly where
I'm gonna land.

26:56.415 --> 26:59.852
- On my feet.
- On my feet.

26:59.886 --> 27:00.920
See it, Emily.

27:06.826 --> 27:08.795
[grunts]

27:08.828 --> 27:09.829
On my ass.

27:09.862 --> 27:12.231
[phone rings]

27:16.102 --> 27:18.805
Hello?

27:18.838 --> 27:20.206
Yeah, this is Damon Young.

27:22.809 --> 27:25.878
[laughs] No way.
No way. I won?

27:27.479 --> 27:30.216
[stammering] I won,
like, the whole thing?

27:31.918 --> 27:33.185
Yeah, yeah, hold on.

27:35.454 --> 27:38.024
Tonight? Denver?
Yes, yes, I can be there.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.260
Uh-huh.

27:42.061 --> 27:44.230
Yes, thank you so much.

27:44.263 --> 27:46.833
OK, bye.

27:46.866 --> 27:50.102
I distinctly wrote 5,000,
not 500.

27:51.804 --> 27:54.974
That paper product supply guy
is seriously trying to kill me.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.076
- I'm sorry, Suzie,
I can't work.
- What's wrong, someone die?

27:57.109 --> 28:00.847
No, no, no. I just have to be
somewhere, like, right now.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.950
No! Damon, Damon.
Don't do this to me.

28:03.983 --> 28:05.785
I'm on the verge.
Like, the complete verge.

28:05.818 --> 28:08.054
If you leave now,
you are fired.

28:09.255 --> 28:11.791
You know what?
I'm fine with that.

28:11.824 --> 28:14.894
I'm so sorry to do this to you,
but this is a once in a lifetime
kind of deal.

28:14.927 --> 28:19.165
Listen, tell Emily that
I will call her the
second she is on her shift.

28:19.198 --> 28:22.268
Tell her I'll be late,
but I will be back tonight
to give her moral support.

28:22.301 --> 28:26.973
- Thank you.
- Oh, yeah. I will be sure
to pass all that along.

28:27.006 --> 28:29.909
I don't get what the problem is.
You've got harder moves.

28:29.942 --> 28:33.145
- It's that move.
- You just need
to hone your focus.

28:33.179 --> 28:35.915
- Do it again.
- I can't.

28:35.948 --> 28:37.283
- Do it again!
- No!

28:37.316 --> 28:38.484
What is your problem, Emily?

28:38.517 --> 28:40.019
It's not about focusing more

28:40.052 --> 28:41.754
or trying harder!
Don't you get it?

28:41.788 --> 28:43.289
No, I don't.
You can do this.

28:43.322 --> 28:45.925
I'm scared, OK?

28:47.860 --> 28:50.797
And I know you don't get it,
because you're the
great Payson Keeler

28:50.830 --> 28:54.533
and everyone knows you've
never been afraid of anything
your whole entire perfect life!

28:54.566 --> 28:57.169
But I can't be
as brave as you, Payson.

28:57.203 --> 28:59.772
I'm terrified
of that blind landing.

28:59.806 --> 29:01.841
You can do this.

29:01.874 --> 29:03.810
If I could do it,
you can do it.

29:03.843 --> 29:06.012
You just have to focus.

29:06.045 --> 29:08.547
Spoken like someone who's
had two normal, happy parents

29:08.580 --> 29:11.818
and has had the great luxury
of focusing on gymnastics
her whole entire life.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.221
I'm sorry.

29:16.956 --> 29:19.091
The pressure is getting
to me just a little bit.

29:21.560 --> 29:24.030
I have something
to tell you that
I haven't told a single person.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.803
I got the go-ahead to do
gymnastics two weeks ago.

29:30.837 --> 29:33.806
I've been lying to everyone.

29:33.840 --> 29:37.576
- Why?
- Because I'm scared.

29:37.609 --> 29:39.111
I'm scared of gymnastics.

29:40.246 --> 29:42.882
- You?
- Yeah.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.984
I don't know what my body
is gonna do, you know?

29:45.017 --> 29:48.154
It's always been the one thing I
can count on, to do what I want.

29:48.187 --> 29:50.923
But now, I mean,
what if it betrays me

29:50.957 --> 29:54.360
or stops me,
breaks me again?

29:54.393 --> 29:57.196
It won't, Payson.
It's not gonna happen.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.966
You have all of that
training behind you.

29:59.999 --> 30:01.934
You can count on that.

30:03.102 --> 30:07.106
When I look at the bars,
I just forget it.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.175
When I stand in front of them,
I can't even breathe.

30:09.208 --> 30:12.244
It's like there's this
invisible wall between me

30:12.278 --> 30:13.980
and every apparatus
in this gym.

30:14.013 --> 30:16.815
That's exactly
what I'm feeling.

30:23.155 --> 30:24.857
I'll do it if you do it.

30:28.895 --> 30:29.962
You first.

30:34.233 --> 30:35.968
No more fear.

30:36.002 --> 30:37.369
From now on, trust.

30:39.438 --> 30:40.439
Trust.

30:42.274 --> 30:44.076
[sighs]

30:44.110 --> 30:45.945
Trust.

31:00.392 --> 31:03.662
[panting]
It was ugly, but...

31:03.695 --> 31:06.899
- But you did it!
- [laughing]

31:12.438 --> 31:14.106
I'm supposed to keep it simple.

31:14.140 --> 31:16.175
Just do a basic,
simple handspring.

31:19.678 --> 31:20.479
I'm waiting.

31:22.048 --> 31:24.383
I can't believe I'm so afraid.

31:24.416 --> 31:27.419
- I got this vault
when I was eight.
- You can do it, Payson.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.257
- Trust.
- Trust.

31:49.976 --> 31:52.011
[gasping]

31:52.044 --> 31:54.180
[laughing]

31:56.115 --> 31:57.516
Ah!

32:04.991 --> 32:08.094
[Sasha] Being the nation's best
comes with pressure
and responsibility, Kaylie.

32:08.127 --> 32:10.362
But you can't let that
translate into fear.
You can't.

32:10.396 --> 32:14.400
But MJ says that she thinks
this could ruin my career.

32:17.336 --> 32:21.340
Kaylie, right now you've got
a lot of voices telling you

32:21.373 --> 32:24.743
you can't do this,
that it will ruin you.
But then there's another voice,

32:24.776 --> 32:28.480
mine, saying you can do this.
It's your choice.

32:28.514 --> 32:30.549
Who are you
gonna listen to?

32:33.152 --> 32:34.520
I just...

32:37.223 --> 32:40.526
I don't think I'm capable
of doing my best right now.

32:43.495 --> 32:46.265
Gymnastics
is an individual sport.

32:49.301 --> 32:52.371
But nobody wins without the
strength of a team behind them.

32:52.404 --> 32:55.141
And no team wins
without a leader.

32:55.174 --> 32:59.511
Your team needs your
loyalty to believe they
have what it takes to win.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.188
You're right.

33:11.190 --> 33:12.491
They need me.

33:14.526 --> 33:16.095
I'll be there.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.566
[indistinct chatter]

33:22.501 --> 33:24.770
[sighs] There you are!

33:24.803 --> 33:27.573
Here I am.
Exactly 15 minutes early.

33:27.606 --> 33:31.077
I've been flying completely
solo out there. I'm buried.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.445
- [phone rings]
- You're not flying solo.
Damon's in tonight.

33:33.479 --> 33:36.182
- Don't even talk
to me about Damon.
- What about him?

33:36.215 --> 33:40.219
He quit. An hour ago.
Haven't heard from him since.

33:40.252 --> 33:42.554
- Damon quit? Tonight?
- Mm-hm.

33:42.588 --> 33:46.558
Just like that. Could never
really count on that guy.

33:54.266 --> 33:56.602
Do you know what you're
doing to these girls?

33:56.635 --> 34:00.072
What I'm doing?
You've got to be kidding me.

34:00.106 --> 34:03.242
Putting all that pressure
on Kaylie Cruz, turning
her manager against her?

34:03.275 --> 34:06.078
- It's pathetic.
- It's not pathetic.

34:06.112 --> 34:08.314
We're advising her
on what's best for her.

34:08.347 --> 34:10.216
You're not advising,
you're scheming.

34:10.249 --> 34:12.484
You're trying to get Kaylie
to pull out because
you know it would be

34:12.518 --> 34:16.355
devastating for the other girls
if just one of them bailed.
I'm happy to tell you

34:16.388 --> 34:20.459
it didn't work.
Kaylie is doing the Invitational
and you can't stop her.

34:20.492 --> 34:23.262
That's why we are
going to stop Emily.

34:23.295 --> 34:26.665
- Excuse me?
- Emily Kmetko has a job.

34:29.335 --> 34:32.638
A clear violation
of the rules of her
National Committee scholarship.

34:32.671 --> 34:36.508
You know, I don't know where
you get your information from,

34:36.542 --> 34:39.178
but Emily would never lie to me.

34:39.211 --> 34:41.847
And she would never
break the rules or do anything
to break her scholarship.

34:41.880 --> 34:44.416
You might want to remind her
of that when you visit her

34:44.450 --> 34:48.520
at The Pizza Shack,
1612 Evergreen Plaza,

34:48.554 --> 34:51.590
Boulder, Colorado.

34:51.623 --> 34:55.661
Those are the people
who have been paying her,
according to the IRS.

34:58.430 --> 35:01.300
Oh, and while you're there,
you can tell her

35:01.333 --> 35:03.635
the National Committee
knows she's in violation
of her scholarship.

35:03.669 --> 35:06.605
And if she competes
in the Invitational,

35:06.638 --> 35:08.640
we pull it.

35:26.225 --> 35:28.660
- [man] When you get a second...
- [indistinct chatter]

35:28.694 --> 35:30.262
[phone ringing]

35:30.296 --> 35:32.164
[woman] Water, over here.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.369
You're in the weeds!
Table two just walked out.

35:37.403 --> 35:40.339
- Do you think I can't see that?
- Speed up your lazy butt,
Emily.

35:40.372 --> 35:42.708
You're killing us here, OK?

35:42.741 --> 35:47.613
If you want a pie,
you're gonna have to hold on.
We're buried here.

35:47.646 --> 35:51.450
Oh, and little Miss Fancy
Panties, she can't keep up.

35:51.483 --> 35:53.452
Get the hell out of my way.

35:57.223 --> 35:58.624
Emily, turn around.

35:59.491 --> 36:00.626
Now.

36:04.763 --> 36:06.698
I can explain.

36:06.732 --> 36:08.634
I'm just filling in
for a friend.

36:10.269 --> 36:12.538
Stop lying to me, Emily.

36:14.240 --> 36:17.576
Sasha, I'm so, so sorry.

36:17.609 --> 36:21.413
I did not mean to break
the rules. I need to work.

36:21.447 --> 36:25.551
- I've always worked.
- You are in really,

36:25.584 --> 36:28.954
- really big trouble right now.
- No!

36:28.987 --> 36:31.623
I'm gonna quit.
I'll quit right now.

36:31.657 --> 36:35.561
- No, you won't!
You will not quit!
- I said get the hell out!

36:37.663 --> 36:40.766
You are in really
big trouble with me,
but worse, right now,

36:40.799 --> 36:43.669
you are in really big trouble
with the National Committee.

36:43.702 --> 36:46.605
They know about your
little hobby making pizzas

36:46.638 --> 36:48.440
and they're threatening
to pull your scholarship.

36:48.474 --> 36:51.677
They can't!
We need this money.

37:02.688 --> 37:04.490
Well, they are
offering you an out.

37:07.626 --> 37:10.662
If you don't do
the Invitational, they say
you can keep your scholarship.

37:10.696 --> 37:14.366
- What am I gonna do?
- If you had just
trusted me, Emily,

37:14.400 --> 37:17.336
we wouldn't be
in this position!

37:18.770 --> 37:20.572
I can't believe
you lied to me.

37:20.606 --> 37:24.443
- I didn't think
that I had a choice.
- Of course, there's a choice!

37:25.577 --> 37:26.645
There's always a choice.

37:26.678 --> 37:27.613
You could have been honest.

37:27.646 --> 37:29.648
If you'd have come to me
in the first place,

37:29.681 --> 37:32.618
I would have found
a way to help you.

37:32.651 --> 37:37.556
You've been given
this incredible chance.
A once in a lifetime chance.

37:37.589 --> 37:41.560
But right now, you're
just throwing it away.

37:45.797 --> 37:49.835
I'm so sorry
that I let you down.

37:51.870 --> 37:55.040
I can't tell you
to do the Invitational.

37:55.073 --> 37:57.676
And I certainly can't
ask your family to give up
part of its livelihood.

37:57.709 --> 38:00.712
So this is your decision.

38:00.746 --> 38:02.381
I'm doing it.

38:03.882 --> 38:07.453
- I'm doing the Invitational.
- You need to think about this

38:07.486 --> 38:10.856
- very carefully, Emily.
- No!

38:10.889 --> 38:14.526
I don't. You've supported me.

38:14.560 --> 38:17.062
You've stuck
your neck out for me

38:17.095 --> 38:19.865
so that I could shine
at that Invitational.

38:19.898 --> 38:22.734
And what did I do?
I lied to you.

38:22.768 --> 38:25.471
And I've let you down.

38:25.504 --> 38:28.440
I'm gonna do it. I'm not
gonna let my teammates down.

38:28.474 --> 38:30.842
And I'm not gonna
let myself down.

38:43.589 --> 38:46.525
Come on. I'll help
you bus some tables.

38:58.604 --> 39:01.640
- [phone rings]
- [sighs]

39:06.678 --> 39:08.647
- Pizza Shack.
- Em, hey, it's me.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.616
Listen, I'm so sorry
I wasn't there tonight.

39:10.649 --> 39:14.720
- I can't do this, Damon.
- But Em, I got really big news.

39:14.753 --> 39:17.856
I can't do this.
The rules at The Rock
are there for a reason.

39:17.889 --> 39:20.526
I can't believe I broke them,

39:20.559 --> 39:23.695
here, at this job
and with you.

39:23.729 --> 39:28.767
I am so close to losing
everything I've worked for,

39:28.800 --> 39:31.937
everything my family has
moved two states away for.

39:31.970 --> 39:34.139
Em, wait,
you gotta hear me out.

39:34.172 --> 39:37.676
I don't.
I can't talk to you, Damon.

39:37.709 --> 39:38.677
I can't see you.

39:38.710 --> 39:39.645
Don't call me.

39:39.678 --> 39:40.812
Don't contact me.

39:40.846 --> 39:42.714
And don't come
to the Invitational.

39:42.748 --> 39:44.382
Goodbye, Damon.

39:51.757 --> 39:54.460
[sobbing]

40:10.676 --> 40:12.744
- Hey.
- Have you talked to Kaylie?

40:12.778 --> 40:15.581
- She's still
not returning my texts.
- You're in good company.

40:15.614 --> 40:17.215
She's hasn't been
returning anyone's texts.

40:17.248 --> 40:22.454
- [dialing]
- [ringing]

40:23.021 --> 40:24.856
It's Lauren. Let me have it.

40:24.890 --> 40:28.860
- [beeping]
- I really need
to talk to you, Lo.

40:28.894 --> 40:31.530
Ellen Beals just
called me personally.

40:31.563 --> 40:34.733
They're scaring me
and I really need you
to tell me that I can do it.

40:37.803 --> 40:40.839
Screw it, it's almost curfew.
I know you're home.
I'm coming over.

40:43.274 --> 40:46.011
Oh, my gosh!
What's wrong, sweetie?

40:49.781 --> 40:51.917
It's bad, Mom.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.752
It's really, really bad.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.655
What is it, sweetie?
You can tell me.

41:04.796 --> 41:07.499
- [sighs]
- What is it?

41:10.769 --> 41:12.738
I've lost my scholarship.

41:14.673 --> 41:17.876
The National Committee
said that if I competed
at the Invitational,

41:17.909 --> 41:21.513
they would pull
my scholarship and...

41:21.547 --> 41:24.816
...I told Sasha
I was doing the Invitational.

41:26.552 --> 41:28.854
Oh, my goodness.

41:28.887 --> 41:31.657
That money
is half of our income.

41:33.725 --> 41:35.861
Did I screw up, Mom?
Did I screw up everything?

41:35.894 --> 41:38.764
- No.
- I did, didn't I?

41:38.797 --> 41:40.799
- No.
- I didn't know what to do.

41:40.832 --> 41:42.901
And I feel so backed
into a corner right now.

41:42.934 --> 41:45.804
Honey,

41:45.837 --> 41:47.973
I have never been
more proud of you.

41:48.006 --> 41:50.075
Really?

41:50.108 --> 41:52.878
You were forced to make
a horrible decision,

41:52.911 --> 41:56.548
but you stood by your friends
and you stood up for yourself.

41:56.582 --> 41:59.751
You didn't allow
those people to own you.

42:01.720 --> 42:02.754
What are we gonna do?

42:02.788 --> 42:05.757
We'll figure it out.

42:05.791 --> 42:07.759
We always do.

42:16.635 --> 42:18.704
If Kaylie found out you've
been living here

42:18.737 --> 42:22.007
after I told her she could
trust us, that would be it.

42:24.810 --> 42:27.545
You told Kaylie
that she could trust me?

42:29.014 --> 42:33.318
I sort of thought you didn't
want us to get back together.

42:33.351 --> 42:35.353
I didn't.

42:35.386 --> 42:37.022
[sighs]

42:37.055 --> 42:39.591
But that trip to China
gave me time to think.

42:39.625 --> 42:41.627
Lauren?

42:45.797 --> 42:48.834
This is... This is
hard for me to say.

42:53.905 --> 42:56.842
I love you, Carter.
It's not a secret anymore.

42:56.875 --> 42:59.611
- I'm sorry, Lauren, but...
- You don't have to say it.

43:00.712 --> 43:03.682
- You love Kaylie.
- Mr. Tanner?

43:03.715 --> 43:06.652
- Lauren isn't here.
- Oh. You know what?

43:06.685 --> 43:11.790
Try the garage apartment.
Apparently, she goes up there
to meditate.

43:11.823 --> 43:13.625
Meditate?

43:15.761 --> 43:18.764
Somehow, going through
all this craziness

43:18.797 --> 43:21.767
has made us friends.

43:24.202 --> 43:25.771
That's true.

43:25.804 --> 43:28.073
You were there for me
when no one else was.

43:31.810 --> 43:33.912
Since you're my friend,

43:33.945 --> 43:35.747
I want you to be happy.

43:36.848 --> 43:38.950
Kaylie's my best friend.

43:38.984 --> 43:40.986
If you and Kaylie
are happy together,

43:41.019 --> 43:43.121
then that will make me happy.

43:47.092 --> 43:48.760
Because I love you both.
