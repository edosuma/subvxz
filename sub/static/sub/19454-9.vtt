00:00.000 --> 00:03.635
Previously on

00:03.637 --> 00:04.336
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>

00:04.338 --> 00:06.372
<i>You'll be performing a good</i>

00:06.374 --> 00:08.807
<i>old-fashioned comedy show.</i>

00:08.809 --> 00:16.682
<i> I am so excited to see the</i>
<i>cast of</i> <i>cocoon</i> is here.
It's very dry.

00:16.684 --> 00:22.021
It's almost kind of like your
vagina, okay?
Tonight wasn't a character,

00:22.023 --> 00:25.758
and I do talk like that,
and I'm sorry--
no, you talk like this.

00:25.760 --> 00:29.895
This is how you talk.
This is all too much for me.
You win.

00:29.897 --> 00:34.400
You broke me down, I feel like
shit, and obviously
I'm annoying.

00:34.402 --> 00:39.605
Bianca Del Rio,
condragulations, you are the
winner of this week's challenge.

00:39.607 --> 00:46.779
Joslyn Fox, shante, you stay.
Laganja Estranja, sashay away.

00:46.781 --> 00:53.018
Wow.

00:53.020 --> 00:54.186
Holy crap.

00:54.188 --> 00:57.756
Girl, this has been a day.

00:57.758 --> 00:58.791
Oh, what did this bitch leave

00:58.793 --> 00:59.925
on the mirror?

00:59.927 --> 01:00.626
Not much.

01:00.628 --> 01:01.660
That's it?

01:01.662 --> 01:02.327
Well...

01:02.329 --> 01:03.862
Well, I mean, no, she did say

01:03.864 --> 01:05.264
that she felt like, you know,

01:05.266 --> 01:06.298
the people here did not like

01:06.300 --> 01:07.399
her, so, I mean, what of much do

01:07.401 --> 01:08.500
you really expect from her?

01:08.502 --> 01:09.268
I mean, come on.

01:09.270 --> 01:09.968
She gone now.

01:09.970 --> 01:10.636
It is what it is.

01:10.638 --> 01:11.970
It's a new chapter, so...

01:11.972 --> 01:12.905
I feel sort of awkward about

01:12.907 --> 01:13.605
the way it ended.

01:13.607 --> 01:14.273
Yeah.

01:14.275 --> 01:15.274
It was just very dark and

01:15.276 --> 01:17.209
ugly, and that was not cute.

01:17.211 --> 01:18.377
It just sucks that she left on

01:18.379 --> 01:20.446
that note, and we couldn't,

01:20.448 --> 01:22.247
like, really patch shit up.

01:22.249 --> 01:25.751
I could have handled it
completely different.
It wasn't a great way to say

01:25.753 --> 01:28.220
goodbye.
It was not.
It wasn't her fault.

01:28.222 --> 01:32.458
It was Bianca that made the--
oh, it's always my fault.
You know what is your fault,

01:32.460 --> 01:34.593
Bianca?
What?
Winning that fucking

01:34.595 --> 01:38.130
challenge.
Yes, and I stole your moment.
Oh, you won.

01:38.132 --> 01:40.833
I'm stealing everything.
Bam.
This was Trinity's time to

01:40.835 --> 01:43.335
shine.
[Laughter]
Bitch.

01:43.337 --> 01:48.340
I didn't go home, and I got
safe, and Ru got emotional.
She did.

01:48.342 --> 01:51.577
I'm so surprised that that

01:51.579 --> 01:53.345
went well, and I think Ru pulled

01:53.347 --> 01:54.313
something out of me that I

01:54.315 --> 01:56.148
didn't know I had, and now my

01:56.150 --> 01:56.982
whole mission is just to win

01:56.984 --> 01:58.917
a fucking challenge.

01:58.919 --> 02:03.255
Honestly, I have to say as
badly as I knew that I did with
this challenge, I really didn't

02:03.257 --> 02:06.158
think I was gonna be in
the bottom two.
I really thought that I fell

02:06.160 --> 02:09.428
kind of middle.
Joslyn's just kind of like
coasting through the

02:09.430 --> 02:11.697
she's like the dida ritz of this

02:11.699 --> 02:13.465
series, really.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.967
Joslyn is not as polished as

02:14.969 --> 02:15.868
some of the other queens in this

02:15.870 --> 02:18.270
competition at this point, so my

02:18.272 --> 02:19.438
guess is that joslyn's next to

02:19.440 --> 02:21.507
go.

02:21.509 --> 02:25.544
Bobby pin.

02:25.546 --> 02:32.351
The winner of <i>RuPaul's drag</i>
<i>race</i> receives a sickening
supply of Colorevolution

02:32.353 --> 02:40.459
cosmetics and a cash prize
of $100,000 with extra special
guest judges, Chaz Bono,

02:40.461 --> 02:45.998
Cher's mom Georgia holt,
and straight up forever
your girl Paula Abdul.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.802
RuPaul Drag Race
may the best woman
best woman win

02:50.804 --> 02:57.409
[laughs]
Ooh.
[Laughs]

02:57.411 --> 03:01.413
It's a new day, and we are
back to seven girls.
It's just gonna keep getting

03:01.415 --> 03:05.417
harder from here on out.
Hey, come on, everybody else.
Oh, wait, there is nobody else.

03:05.419 --> 03:07.419
[Laughs]
Aw.
[Alarm blares]

03:07.421 --> 03:10.889
All: Ooh.
I'm scared.
Ooh, girl.

03:10.891 --> 03:17.062
The top three reasons to become
America's next drag superstar.
Number three, free foot scrubs

03:17.064 --> 03:22.534
from Santino.
Number two, your shit not
only on fire, it could be seen

03:22.536 --> 03:28.273
from outer space.
And the number one reason,
$100,000, hunty.

03:28.275 --> 03:35.080
Now, here's
RuPaul.
[Both gasp]

03:35.082 --> 03:40.219
We're gonna box each other.
Both: We're gonna what?
Box.

03:40.221 --> 03:44.590
How did you get that?
Hello, hello, hello.
All: Hey.

03:44.592 --> 03:49.094
Hello, mama.
My queens.
Now, it's that time in the

03:49.096 --> 03:55.801
competition when your charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent
could really use some

03:55.803 --> 04:00.739
fresh meat.
[Laughs]
Oh, scruff pit crew.

04:00.741 --> 04:04.943
All: Woof, woof,
woof, woof, woof.
Oh, damn.

04:04.945 --> 04:10.249
All: Oh, oh, oh.
Sometimes it's two.
Sometimes it's four, but this

04:10.251 --> 04:14.720
time there are...
[Mouths words]
[Whistles]

04:14.722 --> 04:19.625
Say hello to Johnny scruff,

04:19.627 --> 04:21.526
the founder of the gay social

04:21.528 --> 04:23.095
network scruff.

04:23.097 --> 04:26.265
Hello, ladies.
All: Hi.
So, Johnny, thanks for

04:26.267 --> 04:30.836
bringing the guys.
Are they all on scruff?
Well, you'll have to log on

04:30.838 --> 04:34.806
to find out, miss Ru.
I sure will, then.
[Laughter]

04:34.808 --> 04:41.346
So, ladies, for today's mini
challenge, you're going to
compete in a game of hung man.

04:41.348 --> 04:46.752
You know, it's like hangman but
bigger and longer and a lot
scruffier.

04:46.754 --> 04:51.623
All right, ladies, the clue is

04:51.625 --> 04:54.626
a hot way to serve fish.

04:54.628 --> 05:02.034
A.
S.
Another s.

05:02.036 --> 05:07.205
[Laughter]
O.
Oh.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.341
[Buzzer sounds]
Bianca.
Is it casserole?

05:09.343 --> 05:11.810
Answer is...
[Bell dings]
Yeah.

05:11.812 --> 05:17.282
[Cheers and applause]
Casserole.
Johnny, what is our next clue?

05:17.284 --> 05:19.184
Cases of history repeating.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.753
A.

05:21.755 --> 05:22.788
S.

05:22.790 --> 05:28.126
I wonder where this is going.
[Laughter]
S.

05:28.128 --> 05:31.129
B.
[Buzzer sounds]
Oh, Courtney Act.

05:31.131 --> 05:35.500
I think it's flashbacks, Ru.
Oh.
Flashbacks.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.569
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.237
All right, the clue is

05:39.239 --> 05:41.807
what lady bunny has.

05:41.809 --> 05:45.577
A.
S.
[Buzzer sounds]

05:45.579 --> 05:49.081
Bianca Del Rio, what's your
answer?
Fat ass.

05:49.083 --> 05:52.651
I'm sorry, Bianca.
[Screams]
Right answer in life.

05:52.653 --> 05:57.622
Wrong answer in this game.
[Laughter]
Shut the front door.

05:57.624 --> 06:01.259
Another s.
What are the odds of that?
This game is amazing.

06:01.261 --> 06:04.529
[Laughter]
[Buzzer sounds]
De LA, what's your guess?

06:04.531 --> 06:08.200
No class?
Answer is...

06:08.202 --> 06:09.401
Yeah.

06:09.403 --> 06:10.736
Lady bunny is like school

06:10.738 --> 06:12.504
on the weekend, no class.

06:12.506 --> 06:18.176
The next clue is big in Germany.

06:18.178 --> 06:22.981
A.
[Buzzer sounds]
Adore has buzzed in

06:22.983 --> 06:26.818
with one letter.
Popular in Germany.
Duh.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.854
Hasselhoff.
[Gasps]

06:28.856 --> 06:30.355
You are--yeah.

06:30.357 --> 06:31.323
[Cheers and applause]

06:31.325 --> 06:34.526
These queens are good.
These queens are real good.
Really good.

06:34.528 --> 06:35.761
Here's the clue.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.863
She got a hot body.

06:37.865 --> 06:40.599
[Buzzer sounds]

06:40.601 --> 06:45.937
Oh, with just one b on the
board, what's your guess, de LA?
Butterface.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.006
Ooh, let's see what we have.

06:48.008 --> 06:51.443
[Cheers and applause]

06:51.445 --> 06:57.182
Yeah, she got a hot body but her
face--
all right, Ben de LA, you're

06:57.184 --> 07:01.853
the winner.
[Cheers and applause]
You've won a year supply of

07:01.855 --> 07:09.861
eyelashes from eylure.
Ladies, America's next drag
superstar not only needs to know

07:09.863 --> 07:15.500
how to sissy that walk, she need
to know how to sissy that talk.
Now, for this week's main

07:15.502 --> 07:22.174
challenge, you'll be hosting
your very own talk show.
It's time for the return of

07:22.176 --> 07:25.243
<i>the RuPaul show.</i>
<i> Yay.</i>
<i>[Cheers and applause]</i>

07:25.245 --> 07:30.248
<i> Now, I booked some extra</i>
<i>special guests for you to</i>
<i>interview.</i>

07:30.250 --> 07:36.755
<i>My pal Chaz Bono...</i>
<i>[All gasp]</i>
<i>and his grandmother, Cher's mom,</i>

07:36.757 --> 07:40.358
<i>singer Georgia holt.</i>
<i> Oh, my gosh.</i>
<i>[Applause]</i>

07:40.360 --> 07:46.064
<i> I love Chaz Bono, and Georgia</i>
<i>holt--mm, I'm a country boy.</i>
<i>I love my country music, and she</i>

07:46.066 --> 07:56.274
<i>just has a voice like no other.</i>
<i> I am going to be one degree</i>
<i>of separation away from Cher.</i>

07:56.276 --> 08:02.447
<i> Gentlemen, start your</i>
<i>engines, and may the best woman</i>
<i>win.</i>

08:02.449 --> 08:11.990
<i> I've been read a lot on the</i>
<i>runway for my looks, so the</i>
<i>first thing I'm gonna do is</i>

08:11.992 --> 08:14.059
<i>choose my look.</i>

08:14.061 --> 08:21.666
<i> So I notice that everybody in</i>
<i>the room is working on</i>
<i>their research,</i>

08:21.668 --> 08:23.235
<i>and joslyn runs to her closet</i>

08:23.237 --> 08:24.970
<i>to pull out three ugly dresses.</i>

08:24.972 --> 08:28.206
<i>Really?</i>
<i>I thought for sure she'd have</i>
<i>worn one of her non-bikinis.</i>

08:28.208 --> 08:32.911
<i>This is a special event.</i>
<i> The judges have been pretty</i>
<i>consistent in what they've said</i>

08:32.913 --> 08:41.219
<i>to joslyn about her runway</i>
<i>looks, but I don't think she's</i>
<i>getting the note.</i>

08:41.221 --> 08:49.094
<i> Shit, I'm gonna be okay.</i>
<i> Coming up, we'll be joined by</i>
<i>our extra special guest judge</i>

08:49.096 --> 08:53.465
<i>Paula Abdul.</i>
<i>[All gasp]</i>
<i> I know this person.</i>

08:53.467 --> 08:57.636
<i> Shit's getting real.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>

08:57.638 --> 09:04.309
<i> Our main challenge today is</i>

09:04.311 --> 09:05.443
<i>to be the guest host for</i>

09:05.445 --> 09:06.845
<i>RuPaul's talk show.</i>

09:06.847 --> 09:12.384
<i>We have to interview Chaz Bono</i>
<i>and Georgia holt, and it is</i>
<i>a little bit intimidating.</i>

09:12.386 --> 09:14.853
<i> Can you imagine how many</i>
<i>times they've answered these</i>
<i>same questions?</i>

09:14.855 --> 09:18.957
<i> Right.</i>
<i> So I'm just trying to make it</i>
<i>light and airy, like a fart.</i>

09:18.959 --> 09:23.528
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> Hello, hello, hello.</i>
<i> All: Hi.</i>

09:23.530 --> 09:27.532
<i> How are my hostess twinkies</i>
<i>doing?</i>
<i> Research.</i>

09:27.534 --> 09:31.403
<i> Adore Delano,</i>
<i>how are you doing?</i>
<i> Okay, I'm freaking out</i>

09:31.405 --> 09:34.372
<i>because I want it to come</i>
<i>natural.</i>
<i>When I write shit down,</i>

09:34.374 --> 09:36.942
<i>it gets like, [Gasps]</i>
<i>"Oh, God, I'm--"</i>
<i>like--</i>

09:36.944 --> 09:40.912
<i> but this is the thing, and</i>
<i>this ties into the critique you</i>
<i>got last week on the judge's</i>

09:40.914 --> 09:45.717
<i>panel, which is that if you're</i>
<i>prepared, you'll be fine.</i>
<i> Right.</i>

09:45.719 --> 09:47.152
<i> Adore's really confident in</i>

09:47.154 --> 09:48.587
<i>certain areas, but if it's</i>

09:48.589 --> 09:50.355
<i>outside of her comfort zone,</i>

09:50.357 --> 09:51.723
<i>she kind of crumbles.</i>

09:51.725 --> 09:54.492
<i>I don't think she trusts herself</i>
<i>enough.</i>
<i> Can I hear a little bit of</i>

09:54.494 --> 09:58.163
<i>your opening?</i>
<i> Hello, everyone, my name is</i>
<i>Adore Delano.</i>

09:58.165 --> 10:03.234
<i>I'll be filling in for</i>
<i>miss RuPaul tonight, so I'm</i>
<i>gonna--oh, what?</i>

10:03.236 --> 10:07.939
<i>So--okay, wait.</i>
<i> I'm a bit worried.</i>
<i> Get back to work, all right?</i>

10:07.941 --> 10:12.510
<i> This is gonna be a hot mess.</i>
<i> J-j-j-Joslyn Fox.</i>
<i> Hey, ruzie q.</i>

10:12.512 --> 10:15.480
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i>Quick question.</i>
<i>How many straps are you gonna</i>

10:15.482 --> 10:20.318
<i>wear for the interview?</i>
<i> Zero.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>

10:20.320 --> 10:24.689
<i>Before this, did you know</i>
<i>anything about Chaz</i>
<i>or Georgia holt?</i>

10:24.691 --> 10:26.858
<i> I love Chaz with his</i>
<i>transition.</i>
<i>I think he's been very</i>

10:26.860 --> 10:32.330
<i>forthcoming, and Georgia</i>
<i>i became familiar with after</i>
<i>the lifetime documentary.</i>

10:32.332 --> 10:36.067
<i>You know, she lost the role to</i>
<i>Marilyn Monroe for</i>
<i>the asphalt jungle.</i>

10:36.069 --> 10:39.037
<i>She's so beautiful.</i>
<i>Love her.</i>
<i> Yes.</i>

10:39.039 --> 10:41.973
<i>So your big opening--have you</i>
<i>worked on that?</i>
<i> I have. I have.</i>

10:41.975 --> 10:49.247
<i>Please welcome someone who came</i>
<i>out of Cher's vagina and the</i>
<i>vagina Cher came out of.</i>

10:49.249 --> 10:55.086
<i> I'm just a little worried</i>
<i>about, you know, maybe talking</i>
<i>about Cher's vagina could</i>

10:55.088 --> 11:00.992
<i>possibly offend mother and son.</i>
<i> But that's where</i>
<i>the entertainment lies.</i>

11:00.994 --> 11:01.760
<i> You don't want to be that</i>

11:01.762 --> 11:03.128
<i>queen that pissed off Cher's</i>

11:03.130 --> 11:04.629
<i>family.</i>

11:04.631 --> 11:09.267
<i>Hello?</i>
<i> Listen, we're down to just</i>
<i>very few girls, and, you know,</i>

11:09.269 --> 11:15.674
<i>when the gumbo gets thinned out,</i>
<i>it's a little tough.</i>
<i> I like gumbo, so...</i>

11:15.676 --> 11:19.844
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i>You've got your work cut out</i>
<i>for you.</i>

11:19.846 --> 11:22.180
<i>Get back to it.</i>
<i> Sounds good.</i>
<i> All right.</i>

11:22.182 --> 11:26.551
<i>[Laughs]</i>
<i>De LA.</i>
<i> Hi, Ru.</i>

11:26.553 --> 11:29.454
<i> So this is a big challenge</i>
<i>here.</i>
<i> It is, yeah.</i>

11:29.456 --> 11:37.529
<i> Is this challenge gonna allow</i>
<i>the judges to see the real you?</i>
<i> I-I think so.</i>

11:37.531 --> 11:43.334
<i>I think it'll be nice to be able</i>
<i>to be bringing some version of</i>
<i>the character, but they can have</i>

11:43.336 --> 11:47.372
<i>a genuine conversation and</i>
<i>really be listening.</i>
<i> Right, and because de LA is</i>

11:47.374 --> 11:50.942
<i>a character that you do, I get</i>
<i>a sense that you're a bit of an</i>
<i>introvert.</i>

11:50.944 --> 11:54.713
<i> I tend to be very private</i>
<i>myself.</i>
<i> So the question becomes,</i>

11:54.715 --> 12:01.119
<i>what are you afraid of people</i>
<i>seeing?</i>
<i> Certainly, I can be more</i>

12:01.121 --> 12:05.724
<i>negative, you know.</i>
<i>I've struggled with depression</i>
<i>a lot in my life, not feeling</i>

12:05.726 --> 12:09.694
<i>good enough, not feeling totally</i>
<i>confident.</i>
<i>This character is somebody who</i>

12:09.696 --> 12:17.535
<i>helped me to be more positive,</i>
<i>and I'm hoping that now I can</i>
<i>have her learn from me how to,</i>

12:17.537 --> 12:20.405
<i>you know, have more of the heart</i>
<i>that I think that the judges</i>
<i>are describing.</i>

12:20.407 --> 12:23.808
<i> Absolutely, I think you're</i>
<i>right on the money there.</i>
<i>All right, get back to work.</i>

12:23.810 --> 12:27.846
<i> Thank you, Ru.</i>
<i> Courtney Act.</i>
<i> Howdy. Howdy.</i>

12:27.848 --> 12:30.548
<i> Howdy. Howdy.</i>
<i>You're gonna be an interview</i>
<i>star.</i>

12:30.550 --> 12:34.319
<i> I know, isn't that exciting?</i>
<i> Talk show.</i>
<i> Yeah, I had a question.</i>

12:34.321 --> 12:38.790
<i>I've been having so much fun in</i>
<i>the competition, and I always</i>
<i>feel like, "oh, I'm on</i>

12:38.792 --> 12:41.025
<i>the right track.</i>
<i>I'm doing a good job."</i>
<i>And then when I get to</i>

12:41.027 --> 12:46.064
<i>the judges, I kind of get good</i>
<i>feedback but a bit kind of</i>
<i>lukewarm.</i>

12:46.066 --> 12:51.503
<i>And I was just wondering if you</i>
<i>had any maybe specific points</i>
<i>or things that I could pay</i>

12:51.505 --> 12:54.873
<i>attention to.</i>
<i> You're very polished.</i>
<i>You've got all of that, but</i>

12:54.875 --> 13:02.480
<i>America's next drag superstar</i>
<i>also has soft, tender parts and</i>
<i>who's also as hard as steel.</i>

13:02.482 --> 13:07.418
<i> Mm.</i>
<i> So fully rounded, and this is</i>
<i>the perfect challenge to put</i>

13:07.420 --> 13:12.056
<i>that to the test.</i>
<i> Ru's asking me to give</i>
<i>something more, like humanity</i>

13:12.058 --> 13:19.697
<i>and vulnerability, so I need to</i>
<i>work out how I can bring that</i>
<i>into the interview.</i>

13:19.699 --> 13:23.902
<i> Trinity K. Bonet,</i>
<i>oh, my goodness, that</i>
<i>breakthrough last week.</i>

13:23.904 --> 13:27.172
<i>You must feel on top of</i>
<i>the world.</i>
<i> I do.</i>

13:27.174 --> 13:31.075
<i>I do.</i>
<i> What can you take from that</i>
<i>breakthrough and apply to this</i>

13:31.077 --> 13:36.281
<i>challenge?</i>
<i> I think the advantage of this</i>
<i>challenge is that I get to be</i>

13:36.283 --> 13:40.518
<i>myself and have my own sense of</i>
<i>personality and play with the</i>
<i>questions the way I choose to.</i>

13:40.520 --> 13:44.088
<i> Right, right, right.</i>
<i> I'm actually really excited</i>
<i>about this.</i>

13:44.090 --> 13:49.594
<i> You come very close, but you</i>
<i>haven't won a challenge yet.</i>
<i> No, and that's the goal.</i>

13:49.596 --> 13:50.829
<i>Ru has given me quite a few</i>

13:50.831 --> 13:53.164
<i>chances, so now that I feel like</i>

13:53.166 --> 13:54.866
<i>I'm in the game, I really have</i>

13:54.868 --> 13:55.767
<i>to do this.</i>

13:55.769 --> 14:00.438
<i> All right, ladies,</i>
<i>gather round.</i>
<i>Now, tomorrow on the main stage,</i>

14:00.440 --> 14:05.944
<i>we'll be joined by our extra</i>
<i>special guest judge</i>
<i>Paula Abdul.</i>

14:05.946 --> 14:08.847
<i>[All gasp]</i>
<i>Straight up, y'all.</i>

14:08.849 --> 14:10.582
<i> Paula Abdul judgment--I was</i>

14:10.584 --> 14:11.883
<i>on</i> <i>American idol</i> on season

14:11.885 --> 14:13.618
seven, and to know that she's

14:13.620 --> 14:15.653
gonna be here tonight seeing me

14:15.655 --> 14:16.921
as a full-fledged beautiful

14:16.923 --> 14:18.623
woman of the ocean, I'm really

14:18.625 --> 14:19.991
excited about that.

14:19.993 --> 14:25.430
Like, hi, Paula, I'm a girl now.
Now, in a few moments,
you will head to the studio to

14:25.432 --> 14:30.668
launch your TV talk show
careers.
It's gonna be a really big show,

14:30.670 --> 14:32.737
so don't fuck it up.

14:32.739 --> 14:39.444
How are you feeling?
I mean, you know, it's a lot
to juggle.

14:39.446 --> 14:41.512
How are you feeling?

14:41.514 --> 14:44.515
What'd he say?

14:44.517 --> 14:48.953
And he said that I'm very
polished, but they're not seeing
any humanness to me.

14:48.955 --> 14:59.297
Like, obviously, we love
people who are, like, great at
things, but we also love people

14:59.299 --> 15:03.001
who have weaknesses.
Do you know what I'm saying?
'Cause that's what's

15:03.003 --> 15:06.804
relatable, but you're an alien,
so...
[Laughs]

15:06.806 --> 15:12.577
I know sometimes I can be too
polished or a little bit
Stepford-y.

15:12.579 --> 15:17.682
It's not like I'm not willing to
be vulnerable, but generally
speaking, I'm just happy

15:17.684 --> 15:21.319
or happier.
I can't help it.
That's kind of how my brain

15:21.321 --> 15:27.525
works, or I've--through a lot of
meditation, I find that my life
is very carefree.

15:27.527 --> 15:30.995
I have, like, a lot of passion
and enjoyment.
See I'm already alienated

15:30.997 --> 15:35.366
right now talking to you.
[Laughs]

15:35.368 --> 15:36.367
Coming up...

15:36.369 --> 15:37.435
Hello, welcome to

15:37.437 --> 15:39.270
<i>the RuPaul show.</i>

15:39.272 --> 15:40.371
<i> Please welcome someone who</i>

15:40.373 --> 15:42.740
<i>has come out twice since coming</i>

15:42.742 --> 15:44.642
<i>out of Cher and someone who's</i>

15:44.644 --> 15:47.211
<i>came back 66 years after Cher</i>

15:47.213 --> 15:51.115
<i>came out of her.</i>

15:51.117 --> 16:01.259
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> Five, four, three, two...</i>
<i>  so here it comes </i>

16:01.261 --> 16:06.798
<i> round again </i>
<i> heart beat fast </i>
<i> my head is spinning </i>

16:06.800 --> 16:11.970
<i> today's main challenge is to</i>
<i>guest host</i> <i>the RuPaul show.</i>
<i> Hello, welcome to</i>

16:11.972 --> 16:17.008
<i>the RuPaul show.</i>
<i>My name is Adore Delano.</i>
<i> I'm the foxy Joslyn Fox.</i>

16:17.010 --> 16:21.045
<i> I am Trinity K. Bonet,</i>
<i>and I am filling--filling in</i>
<i>for RuPaul tonight.</i>

16:21.047 --> 16:27.485
<i> I'm the first up to interview</i>
<i>Chaz Bono and Georgia holt.</i>
<i>This is live TV, so I just am</i>

16:27.487 --> 16:32.223
<i>kind of shaking in my heels.</i>
<i>This is such an honor.</i>
<i>Like, I'm freaking out</i>

16:32.225 --> 16:37.161
<i>right now.</i>
<i>Just say--ow, my ring got caught</i>
<i>into my fishnet.</i>

16:37.163 --> 16:40.431
<i>[Laughs]</i>
<i>Let me see.</i>
<i>Hmm.</i>

16:40.433 --> 16:46.004
<i>Oh, okay.</i>
<i>Well, let me refer to my notes.</i>
<i>I'm still fresh.</i>

16:46.006 --> 16:52.443
<i>Sorry.</i>
<i>So I read that you were</i>
<i>performing at the age of seven.</i>

16:52.445 --> 16:56.547
<i>Were you, like, the big, like,</i>
<i>childhood star of your,</i>
<i>like, community?</i>

16:56.549 --> 16:59.684
<i> No, honey, we were broke, and</i>
<i>it was during the depression.</i>
<i> I love it.</i>

16:59.686 --> 17:02.987
<i>Party.</i>
<i>My mom always pushes me, and so,</i>
<i>like, I was wondering, well, did</i>

17:02.989 --> 17:05.456
<i>you have, like, a stage daddy?</i>
<i>'Cause I call my mom stage</i>
<i>momma.</i>

17:05.458 --> 17:07.592
<i> I don't know how to explain</i>
<i>it to you.</i>
<i>We had no money.</i>

17:07.594 --> 17:09.594
<i> Oh.</i>
<i> And there was no food.</i>
<i> Mm-hmm.</i>

17:09.596 --> 17:12.563
<i> So I would go and sing, and</i>
<i>people would give me nickels</i>
<i>and dimes and--</i>

17:12.565 --> 17:18.002
<i> right.</i>
<i>I'm having a really hard time</i>
<i>with this talk show shit.</i>

17:18.004 --> 17:20.371
<i>I didn't know so much goes</i>
<i>into it.</i>
<i>I thought you just meet your</i>

17:20.373 --> 17:24.275
<i>guest.</i>
<i>You have a party.</i>
<i>You have a cute little mug.</i>

17:24.277 --> 17:27.645
<i>I'm like, "fuck, shit's getting</i>
<i>real."</i>
<i>Oh, that's amazing, though.</i>

17:27.647 --> 17:30.048
<i> It was during the depression.</i>
<i> Okay.</i>
<i> Yep, yeah.</i>

17:30.050 --> 17:35.186
<i> That's amazing.</i>
<i>That's so cool.</i>
<i> In your original book,</i>

17:35.188 --> 17:39.357
<i>family outing,</i> you discussed
how at 13, that you felt
different.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.559
Right.
Could you elaborate on that?
Sure.

17:41.561 --> 17:46.464
As my hormones started to go,
I had an attraction towards
women, and so I naturally just

17:46.466 --> 17:50.968
made the assumption that I must
be gay, and that must be
what all these feelings are.

17:50.970 --> 17:54.472
Now, of course, in 1995,
you came out publicly.
What was your father's thought?

17:54.474 --> 17:59.177
He was comfortable, but,
you know, the first person in
the family that I talked to was

17:59.179 --> 18:02.080
my grandma.
Really?

18:02.082 --> 18:09.353
And, of course, she was
amazing.
And then the magical

18:09.355 --> 18:14.559
experience <i>dancing with</i>
<i>the stars,</i> how was that?
Bianca talked to me a lot and

18:14.561 --> 18:20.298
kind of ignored my grandmother
a little bit, so I was throwing
her these kind of balls of,

18:20.300 --> 18:23.634
like, "here, let's include her
in this."
Was it liberating to be

18:23.636 --> 18:26.237
in that moment?
You know, learning the dances
and dealing with all of it is

18:26.239 --> 18:30.041
pretty great.
Oh, great, so the stage
manager's telling me I've got to

18:30.043 --> 18:33.277
wrap it up, and I haven't asked
miss Georgia anything.
Thank you, guys,

18:33.279 --> 18:37.982
so, so very much.
Shit.
[Laughs]

18:37.984 --> 18:40.918
Oh, my God.
I'm so excited, you know.
Not nervous excited,

18:40.920 --> 18:43.888
but really excited.
And I have a ton of questions
for you guys.

18:43.890 --> 18:50.261
Well, Chad.
Chad, I know that you do a lot
in the lgbt community.

18:50.263 --> 18:55.266
Trinity kept calling me Chad,
and golden rule:
You got to know the name of the

18:55.268 --> 19:00.805
person that you're interviewing.
Okay, so Chad, are you
a boxer or brief type of guy?

19:00.807 --> 19:05.042
That, to me, was a problem.
[Laughs]
Chad, if you had the

19:05.044 --> 19:12.416
opportunity to go out on a--
on a date with Megan fox,
Angelina Jolie, or--

19:12.418 --> 19:20.291
I need one more person.
It was kind of uncomfortable.
I don't know if it was me

19:20.293 --> 19:24.462
or if it was them.
This interview is weird.
[Laughs]

19:24.464 --> 19:29.667
Well, thank you Chad Bono
and Georgia holt.
Georgia, obviously, you've

19:29.669 --> 19:33.738
just released your first
ever album.
You recorded the album 30 years

19:33.740 --> 19:38.509
ago, and then 30 years later,
you find these tapes.
How did that happen?

19:38.511 --> 19:42.013
Cher asked me, "mom, what'd
you do with those tapes?"
And I said, "honey, I think

19:42.015 --> 19:44.582
they're in the garage."
This must be a pretty
well-organized garage.

19:44.584 --> 19:47.385
Like, 30--
[Laughs]
I mean, I've got things from,

19:47.387 --> 19:50.521
you know, two years ago I don't
know where they are.
I save everything.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.990
It's not an episode of
<i>hoarders</i> waiting to happen,
I guess, or is it?

19:52.992 --> 19:57.061
No.
No.
I know that you've just done

19:57.063 --> 20:01.832
the documentary <i>becoming Chaz.</i>
<i> Mm-hmm.</i>
<i> And what was the decision</i>

20:01.834 --> 20:04.735
<i>that made you want to go</i>
<i>so public with such a personal</i>
<i>thing?</i>

20:04.737 --> 20:09.006
<i> You know, there was a number</i>
<i>of years where I knew I was</i>
<i>transgender but was afraid to do</i>

20:09.008 --> 20:13.110
<i>anything about it.</i>
<i>And so it was important for me</i>
<i>to kind of give that back.</i>

20:13.112 --> 20:17.114
<i>I figured there's other people</i>
<i>out there like me who are--</i>
<i>who are stuck.</i>

20:17.116 --> 20:22.553
<i> That's so cool.</i>
<i> Courtney came across very</i>
<i>professional and very likeable.</i>

20:22.555 --> 20:27.191
<i>I thought she had a lot of</i>
<i>charm, didn't you think, Chaz?</i>
<i> I did, absolutely.</i>

20:27.193 --> 20:30.461
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> No.</i>
<i>I love Australian women.</i>

20:30.463 --> 20:35.099
<i>A huge thing for Australian</i>
<i>women.</i>
<i> So Chaz, are there any kind</i>

20:35.101 --> 20:39.437
<i>of traits that you would say</i>
<i>that you really kind of pulled</i>
<i>from your mother Cher?</i>

20:39.439 --> 20:43.241
<i> No.</i>
<i> No.</i>
<i>[Chuckles]</i>

20:43.243 --> 20:47.345
<i>Right.</i>
<i>Now, besides the drop in the IQ</i>
<i>and remembering to put the seat</i>

20:47.347 --> 20:52.049
<i>down, has their been, like, hard</i>
<i>things that you've had to, like,</i>
<i>adjust to now being a man?</i>

20:52.051 --> 20:58.055
<i> No, not really.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> Georgia, are there anything</i>

20:58.057 --> 21:03.928
<i>about, like, the music today--</i>
<i>do you--do you consider, like,</i>
<i>maybe doing a tour of your</i>

21:03.930 --> 21:06.764
<i>album?</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i>Not at 87.</i>

21:06.766 --> 21:10.368
<i> No?</i>
<i> No.</i>
<i> Right, and I have one more</i>

21:10.370 --> 21:17.408
<i>question for you, my dear.</i>
<i>Are you</i>
<i> pure cherokee </i>

21:17.410 --> 21:19.877
<i> [laughs]</i>
<i>I don't know, she just was fun</i>
<i>to me.</i>

21:19.879 --> 21:24.148
<i> But she seemed to be getting</i>
<i>thrown.</i>
<i>Jewelry seemed to be falling off</i>

21:24.150 --> 21:31.589
<i>of her, and she seemed a little</i>
<i>physically uncomfortable.</i>
<i> Well, Georgia, what is it</i>

21:31.591 --> 21:36.460
<i>like to have an album that you</i>
<i>recorded 31 years ago hitting</i>
<i>the charts right now?</i>

21:36.462 --> 21:40.464
<i> It feels fantastic.</i>
<i>I started in singing when I was</i>
<i>six during the depression.</i>

21:40.466 --> 21:44.201
<i> My goodness.</i>
<i> You are way too young to know</i>
<i>anything about the depression.</i>

21:44.203 --> 21:47.271
<i> Well, I've experienced other</i>
<i>kinds of depression, but--</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

21:47.273 --> 21:50.141
<i> Very funny.</i>
<i> And, now, Chaz, you also have</i>
<i>a recent Project,</i>

21:50.143 --> 21:53.978
<i>independence day.</i>
<i> Yeah, we actually close</i>
<i>tonight.</i>

21:53.980 --> 21:56.714
<i> Have you gotten a chance to</i>
<i>see Chaz's musical at all?</i>
<i> I haven't.</i>

21:56.716 --> 21:59.216
<i> It's closing night.</i>
<i> I know it.</i>
<i>I know it.</i>

21:59.218 --> 22:01.352
<i> Could you maybe hum us a few</i>
<i>bars?</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>

22:01.354 --> 22:03.487
<i> Maybe Georgia will just--</i>
<i>maybe she could get a</i>
<i>sneak peek right now?</i>

22:03.489 --> 22:06.190
<i> Very funny.</i>
<i> I actually really like</i>
<i>Ben de LA creme.</i>

22:06.192 --> 22:09.427
<i>I thought she asked smart</i>
<i>and interesting questions.</i>
<i> Thank you both so much.</i>

22:09.429 --> 22:12.530
<i> You were good.</i>
<i> Good. Well-done.</i>
<i> Well-done.</i>

22:12.532 --> 22:17.668
<i> Please welcome someone who</i>
<i>has come out twice since coming</i>
<i>out of Cher and someone who's</i>

22:17.670 --> 22:24.241
<i>came back 66 years after Cher</i>
<i>came out of her.</i>
<i>I'm so looking forward to</i>

22:24.243 --> 22:26.711
<i>getting to know you better,</i>
<i>Georgia.</i>
<i>I'm a big fan of yours.</i>

22:26.713 --> 22:29.413
<i> Really?</i>
<i> I love your cd.</i>
<i>I'm just your yesterday,</i> will

22:29.415 --> 22:33.150
that end up on Cher's new album?
I don't know.
She doesn't remember recording

22:33.152 --> 22:35.219
her part.
Okay.
And I don't remember

22:35.221 --> 22:37.822
recording my part.
Okay, well, I don't remember
what I had for breakfast today.

22:37.824 --> 22:41.759
[Laughter]
We're even.
Now, if it weren't for

22:41.761 --> 22:47.598
a last-minute decision at
the abortion clinic, the world
wouldn't have known Cher.

22:47.600 --> 22:52.970
Are you pro-life?
Has your stance changed at all
throughout your lifetime?

22:52.972 --> 22:56.774
I think--I actually--
I don't--I really don't know
how I feel.

22:56.776 --> 23:01.946
It was a little bit embarrassing
to me, and I'm trying to think
of how to, you know, recover.

23:01.948 --> 23:05.716
Yeah, it was putting her on
the spot in a way that you
don't--you know, why would you

23:05.718 --> 23:11.555
ever ask that?
[Laughs]
I feel some really good rapport

23:11.557 --> 23:16.127
between me, Chaz, and Georgia.
It almost feels like I've known
them all my life, and they have

23:16.129 --> 23:20.231
no problem opening up to me.
Thank you both very much.
I've got this one in the bag.

23:20.233 --> 23:23.801
[Giggles]
That's all the time we have,
and I'm all out of duct tape.

23:23.803 --> 23:27.571
Coming up...

23:27.573 --> 23:28.506
What animal are you?

23:28.508 --> 23:29.373
Like, a mortal kombat

23:29.375 --> 23:31.175
character.

23:31.177 --> 23:32.076
You came in middle of the

23:32.078 --> 23:33.611
pack to me.

23:33.613 --> 23:35.679
[Laughs]

23:35.681 --> 23:50.161
[Laughs]

23:50.163 --> 23:58.369
Cover girl
put the bass in your walk
head to toe

23:58.371 --> 24:06.076
let your whole body talk
and what?
Welcome to the main stage of

24:06.078 --> 24:11.015
<i>Michelle Visage, can we talk?</i>

24:11.017 --> 24:12.216
<i> We can always talk.</i>

24:12.218 --> 24:14.285
<i> Santino Rice, let's have</i>

24:14.287 --> 24:15.052
<i>a kiki.</i>

24:15.054 --> 24:16.220
<i> [Laughs]</i>

24:16.222 --> 24:18.589
<i> And Chaz Bono and Georgia</i>

24:18.591 --> 24:20.624
<i>holt, I hope my queens gave you</i>

24:20.626 --> 24:21.592
<i>the star treatment.</i>

24:21.594 --> 24:23.894
<i> They did.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i> I feel like a honky tonk</i>

24:23.896 --> 24:26.430
<i>woman.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i>that's the name of your album,</i>

24:26.432 --> 24:28.999
<i>isn't it, Georgia?</i>
<i> Yes, it is.</i>
<i> I love</i> <i>love me tender.</i>

24:29.001 --> 24:34.038
<i>It's fantastic.</i>
<i> Thank you.</i>
<i> And a pop icon who is forever</i>

24:34.040 --> 24:38.909
<i>my girl, the one and only</i>
<i>Paula Abdul.</i>
<i>Hi, baby.</i>

24:38.911 --> 24:43.614
<i> I'm so happy to be here.</i>
<i> Now, did you know that you</i>
<i>are the most lip-synched artist</i>

24:43.616 --> 24:48.185
<i>in the her-story of</i> <i>Drag Race?</i>
<i> That's fantastic news.</i>
<i>I feel honored.</i>

24:48.187 --> 24:54.091
<i> This week we challenged our</i>
<i>queens to become talk show</i>
<i>hostesses with the most-esses,</i>

24:54.093 --> 25:00.698
<i>and tonight they're going wild</i>
<i>on the runway in their own</i>
<i>animal kingdom couture.</i>

25:00.700 --> 25:04.535
<i>I hope you're ready for some</i>
<i>jungle fever.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

25:04.537 --> 25:10.508
<i>Gentlemen, start your engines,</i>
<i>and may the best woman win.</i>
<i>Now sissy that walk.</i>

25:10.510 --> 25:16.881
<i>Up first, Darienne Lake.</i>
<i>Michelle, I didn't want to say</i>
<i>this, but there's an elephant in</i>

25:16.883 --> 25:18.883
<i>the room.</i>
<i> Yes.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>

25:18.885 --> 25:22.953
<i> Elephants are lucky.</i>
<i>They're fabulous, and I'm</i>
<i>serving you all of my elephant</i>

25:22.955 --> 25:27.258
<i>glory.</i>
<i> All that junk in that trunk.</i>
<i> Horton hears a ho.</i>

25:27.260 --> 25:33.197
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> Adore Delano.</i>
<i>Nice grill.</i>

25:33.199 --> 25:36.133
<i> You know what would go great</i>
<i>with Adore's outfit?</i>
<i> No.</i>

25:36.135 --> 25:40.037
<i> A chianti and some</i>
<i>fava beans.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

25:40.039 --> 25:44.408
<i> I'm fucking serving</i>
<i>animal kingdom couture.</i>
<i>I'm feeling really sexy.</i>

25:44.410 --> 25:47.845
<i> Silence of the queens.</i>
<i> I think she's masking</i>
<i>a lot of pain.</i>

25:47.847 --> 25:52.082
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i>Ben de LA creme.</i>
<i> Oh.</i>

25:52.084 --> 25:55.319
<i> Ooh.</i>
<i> Waiter, there's a fly on my</i>
<i>runway.</i>

25:55.321 --> 25:57.955
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> Be afraid.</i>
<i> Yes.</i>

25:57.957 --> 26:00.157
<i> Be very afraid.</i>
<i> Yes.</i>
<i> I'm just buzzing down</i>

26:00.159 --> 26:03.594
<i>the runaway.</i>
<i>I'm feeling the fantasy.</i>
<i> She's got some fly</i>

26:03.596 --> 26:08.465
<i>choreography.</i>
<i> Yeah, she's a fly girl.</i>
<i>She bugging.</i>

26:08.467 --> 26:13.737
<i> Next up, Bianca Del Rio,</i>
<i>cheetah girl.</i>
<i> Can a queen really change her</i>

26:13.739 --> 26:17.641
<i>spots?</i>
<i> You know the saying, big cats</i>
<i>are dangerous, but a little</i>

26:17.643 --> 26:20.844
<i>pussy never hurt anybody.</i>
<i> That is some pointer sisters</i>
<i>hair right there.</i>

26:20.846 --> 26:23.614
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i>She's so excited.</i>
<i> Hmm.</i>

26:23.616 --> 26:28.252
<i> Next up, Joslyn Fox.</i>
<i>She's a red fox.</i>
<i> She's a cock.</i>

26:28.254 --> 26:31.221
<i> Yes, she is.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> Oh.</i>

26:31.223 --> 26:34.358
<i> Oh.</i>
<i> Holla.</i>
<i>I've got my talons and my</i>

26:34.360 --> 26:38.362
<i>feathers, and I'm showing off</i>
<i>some skin, and I'm feeling</i>
<i>really good about it.</i>

26:38.364 --> 26:43.701
<i> I think it's some kind of</i>
<i>jungle pussycat.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

26:43.703 --> 26:48.305
<i>From Atlanta, Georgia,</i>
<i>Trinity K. Bonet,</i>
<i>the Phoenix.</i>

26:48.307 --> 26:50.808
<i> She's awfully plucked</i>
<i>tonight.</i>
<i> Yes.</i>

26:50.810 --> 26:54.845
<i> I am giving you birds of</i>
<i>a feather flock together</i>
<i>rhythms, and I look absolutely</i>

26:54.847 --> 26:59.016
<i>fabulous.</i>
<i> Dressed to quill.</i>
<i>You better sissy that squawk.</i>

26:59.018 --> 27:04.154
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i>Next up, Courtney Act.</i>
<i> Oh.</i>

27:04.156 --> 27:07.791
<i> Mm.</i>
<i> Oh, my goodness.</i>
<i>Heaven must be missing an angel.</i>

27:07.793 --> 27:10.394
<i> Mm-hmm.</i>
<i> Look at the size of those</i>
<i>wings.</i>

27:10.396 --> 27:15.332
<i> Yes.</i>
<i>Prepare for takeoff.</i>
<i> I'm giving some regal eagle.</i>

27:15.334 --> 27:20.270
<i>I want to see this on blogs.</i>
<i>I want to see this on Facebook.</i>
<i>Ain't nobody gonna top this</i>

27:20.272 --> 27:23.374
<i>shit.</i>
<i> Mm, think I've died and gone</i>
<i>to heaven.</i>

27:23.376 --> 27:25.709
<i> Uh-huh.</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>
<i> Baby, these girls are giving</i>

27:25.711 --> 27:29.780
<i>production value.</i>
<i> Okay.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>

27:29.782 --> 27:33.217
<i> Welcome, ladies.</i>
<i>It's time for the judge's</i>
<i>critiques.</i>

27:33.219 --> 27:37.921
<i>First up, Darienne Lake.</i>
<i> Well, Darienne, it's colder</i>
<i>in here than I thought it was.</i>

27:37.923 --> 27:41.091
<i> Ooh.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> tonight your look is</i>

27:41.093 --> 27:44.061
<i>inspired.</i>
<i>I love the grey hair, and your</i>
<i>face looks gorgeous.</i>

27:44.063 --> 27:48.799
<i>As far as the talk show goes,</i>
<i>you seemed really nervous.</i>
<i> Really?</i>

27:48.801 --> 27:52.536
<i> You did.</i>
<i> Yeah, I got the sense that</i>
<i>you were a little bit awkward.</i>

27:52.538 --> 27:55.873
<i>You came in middle of the pack</i>
<i>to me.</i>
<i> All right, next up,</i>

27:55.875 --> 28:00.144
<i>Adore Delano.</i>
<i> Hi.</i>
<i> What wild life animal are you</i>

28:00.146 --> 28:03.280
<i>representing?</i>
<i> Like, a panther, but I also</i>
<i>wanted to look like</i>

28:03.282 --> 28:07.918
<i>a mortal kombat character.</i>
<i> I'm not loving this look.</i>
<i>Love the face.</i>

28:07.920 --> 28:13.023
<i>I love your makeup.</i>
<i>I love you, but all these</i>
<i>pieces--it's just not elevating</i>

28:13.025 --> 28:17.594
<i>it up enough.</i>
<i> I'm hearing you converse.</i>
<i>I'm going, "I know this person."</i>

28:17.596 --> 28:22.433
<i> Season seven American--</i>
<i> yes,</i> <i>American idol.</i>
<i>It's nice to see you, but what</i>

28:22.435 --> 28:26.170
<i>I'd like is to not see</i>
<i>this mask.</i>
<i>It's counterproductive to</i>

28:26.172 --> 28:31.175
<i>the amazing personality</i>
<i>that I remember so well.</i>
<i> You just seemed really</i>

28:31.177 --> 28:34.478
<i>nervous during our interview.</i>
<i> I was.</i>
<i> It just seemed like you were</i>

28:34.480 --> 28:38.782
<i>really struggling through it.</i>
<i> All right, next up,</i>
<i>Ben de LA creme,</i>

28:38.784 --> 28:43.554
<i> fly, fly, fly, fly </i>
<i>[Laughs]</i>
<i> I think you did a great job</i>

28:43.556 --> 28:48.125
<i>with the interviews.</i>
<i>You were really up-to-date on</i>
<i>everything that both of us were</i>

28:48.127 --> 28:50.594
<i>doing.</i>
<i>You were kind of like a breath</i>
<i>of fresh air.</i>

28:50.596 --> 28:54.932
<i> There's a sense of</i>
<i>something's been dropped,</i>
<i>and it's so much more endearing.</i>

28:54.934 --> 28:59.203
<i> All right, next up, blame it</i>
<i>on Bianca Del Rio.</i>
<i> Always blaming me.</i>

28:59.205 --> 29:04.074
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> I love how you did the body</i>
<i>paint and the face paint to</i>

29:04.076 --> 29:06.343
<i>match with the dress.</i>
<i>I think it looks great.</i>
<i> Thank you.</i>

29:06.345 --> 29:10.447
<i> But with the interview, you</i>
<i>weren't really focusing on the</i>
<i>other person that was there,</i>

29:10.449 --> 29:13.417
<i>which was my grandma.</i>
<i> I had some questions for miss</i>
<i>Georgia that I wanted to ask,</i>

29:13.419 --> 29:15.786
<i>but time management definitely</i>
<i>was an issue.</i>
<i> Is there a question you'd</i>

29:15.788 --> 29:20.057
<i>like to ask Georgia now?</i>
<i> Well, I wanted to ask them if</i>
<i>they believe in life after love.</i>

29:20.059 --> 29:23.360
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> Thank you, Bianca.</i>
<i> Thank you.</i>

29:23.362 --> 29:26.997
<i> Next up, Joslyn Fox on the</i>
<i>runway.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>

29:26.999 --> 29:30.601
<i> What animal are you?</i>
<i> I'm a glam-azonian warrior</i>
<i>princess.</i>

29:30.603 --> 29:34.037
<i>I'm friends with all the</i>
<i>animals, and then I take 'em</i>
<i>and I skin 'em alive.</i>

29:34.039 --> 29:40.477
<i>I'm the Diane Sawyer of the</i>
<i>jungle.</i>
<i> I'm not seeing what I want</i>

29:40.479 --> 29:45.649
<i>from you with this.</i>
<i>It's not quite animal enough.</i>
<i> Now, onto the talk show.</i>

29:45.651 --> 29:50.954
<i>You had me with you, then</i>
<i>decided to go all hard news.</i>
<i> How do you feel about</i>

29:50.956 --> 29:57.528
<i>abortion?</i>
<i> Uh...</i>
<i> We do not discuss these</i>

29:57.530 --> 30:01.165
<i>things.</i>
<i>Really uncomfortable as a viewer</i>
<i>watching that.</i>

30:01.167 --> 30:06.036
<i> You say your character skins</i>
<i>animals alive.</i>
<i>Well, it felt like you were</i>

30:06.038 --> 30:08.639
<i>skinning your guests alive.</i>

30:08.641 --> 30:20.217
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> We do not discuss these</i>
<i>things.</i>

30:20.219 --> 30:24.121
<i>Really uncomfortable as a viewer</i>
<i>watching that.</i>
<i> Georgia, were you offended?</i>

30:24.123 --> 30:28.258
<i> I was uneasy.</i>
<i>It made me uneasy.</i>
<i> That will go down as one of</i>

30:28.260 --> 30:32.563
<i>my biggest mistakes I've ever</i>
<i>made because I just Adore you,</i>
<i>and it breaks my heart,</i>

30:32.565 --> 30:35.499
<i>and I will never forgive myself</i>
<i>if I in any way offended you.</i>

30:35.501 --> 30:39.169
<i> Thank you, honey.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Everything you said was very</i>

30:39.171 --> 30:45.275
<i>sweet, and I appreciate it.</i>
<i>I thought you were really great</i>
<i>up until that one remark.</i>

30:45.277 --> 30:49.446
<i> Next up, Courtney Act.</i>
<i> Howdy.</i>
<i> I am secure enough in my</i>

30:49.448 --> 30:53.417
<i>heterosexuality to say wow.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> You look really cute.</i>

30:53.419 --> 30:57.454
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> I like hancock.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

30:57.456 --> 31:02.993
<i> The second I saw you on</i>
<i>camera, I was engaged, and I</i>
<i>felt like you were a girlfriend,</i>

31:02.995 --> 31:07.598
<i>and that's really important to</i>
<i>a viewer to feel like they can</i>
<i>relate to you.</i>

31:07.600 --> 31:13.003
<i> Next stop, Trinity K. Bonet.</i>
<i> Your whole look, everything</i>
<i>is so well thought out.</i>

31:13.005 --> 31:18.976
<i>Every little detail--</i>
<i>just gorgeous.</i>
<i> As far as the talk show,</i>

31:18.978 --> 31:22.813
<i>rule number one, when you have</i>
<i>a guest, you need to know</i>
<i>their name.</i>

31:22.815 --> 31:27.317
<i>You kept calling Chaz "Chad",</i>
<i>and that in and of itself</i>
<i>was uncomfortable.</i>

31:27.319 --> 31:31.188
<i> When my nerves get the best</i>
<i>of me, it takes a toll.</i>
<i> Trinity, honey, I started</i>

31:31.190 --> 31:38.028
<i>working on television in 1949,</i>
<i>but doing the show today, I was</i>
<i>nervous, and I'm an old pro,</i>

31:38.030 --> 31:42.566
<i>you know?</i>
<i>So you'll get over it,</i>
<i>and you'll become so proud.</i>

31:42.568 --> 31:45.769
<i> That's good advice.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i> Mm-hmm.</i>

31:45.771 --> 31:51.308
<i> I think we've heard enough.</i>
<i>While you unwind in the untucked</i>
<i>lounge, the judges and I</i>

31:51.310 --> 31:57.948
<i>will deliberate.</i>
<i>All right, just between us</i>
<i>chatty cathys, what do you</i>

31:57.950 --> 32:02.753
<i>think?</i>
<i>Let's start with Darienne Lake.</i>
<i> I loved her costume, but her</i>

32:02.755 --> 32:06.757
<i>interview--I think that the</i>
<i>nerves got to her.</i>
<i>I remember that she gave a Cher</i>

32:06.759 --> 32:10.427
<i>impersonation, and it was like</i>
<i>you could hear crickets.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

32:10.429 --> 32:13.730
<i> Yeah, I mean, give me,</i>
<i>you know, Chad Michaels or...</i>
<i> Totally.</i>

32:13.732 --> 32:17.401
<i> Don't waste your time.</i>
<i> All right, next up,</i>
<i>Adore Delano.</i>

32:17.403 --> 32:23.774
<i> I was hoping to see that same</i>
<i>sassiness and smart mouth that</i>
<i>i came to fall in love with on</i>

32:23.776 --> 32:27.444
<i>American idol,</i> but I didn't get
to see it today.
She was so nervous,

32:27.446 --> 32:31.581
she couldn't ground herself.
I think she probably should
have had her notes written

32:31.583 --> 32:34.651
so that she wouldn't be
confused.
I can't remember what I said

32:34.653 --> 32:40.424
10 seconds ago.
[Laughter]
She epitomizes that young kid

32:40.426 --> 32:46.363
who hasn't quite connected the
dots with her talent, her
intellect, and this challenge

32:46.365 --> 32:50.867
really showed that, you know.
You make one misstep, and--
and then merle comes back?

32:50.869 --> 32:54.838
[Laughter]
Is that what you're telling me?
All right, let's move on to

32:54.840 --> 32:58.742
Ben de LA creme.
I thought her costume
was incredible.

32:58.744 --> 33:03.547
She evidently has studied flies
walking across the floor,
because she did it perfect.

33:03.549 --> 33:06.817
Yeah, we're seeing Ben de LA
now.
Mm.

33:06.819 --> 33:10.754
There's this wall that's been
kind of knocked down, and that
translated in her talk show.

33:10.756 --> 33:14.691
Despite wearing the most hideous
color ever created...
[Laughs]

33:14.693 --> 33:19.463
She was fantastic.
All right, let's move on.
Bianca Del Rio.

33:19.465 --> 33:26.203
The thing about Bianca is,
she's so smart and professional
that she made it about that, and

33:26.205 --> 33:29.973
she forgot all the things that
you actually have to do when you
do a talk show, like listen to

33:29.975 --> 33:33.210
the people that you're
interviewing.
Yeah, it probably comes with

33:33.212 --> 33:38.415
Bianca Del Rio being more of a
night club host where if you ask
a question to the audience,

33:38.417 --> 33:40.984
you really don't care what they
have to say.
[Laughs]

33:40.986 --> 33:44.688
But that just takes a little
bit of practice.
She's got all the important

33:44.690 --> 33:48.191
ingredients to do this well if
she wants to do this
professionally.

33:48.193 --> 33:51.628
All right, up next,
Joslyn Fox.
There was no animal

33:51.630 --> 33:54.765
interpretation in that
whatsoever.
She stuck some feathers on her

33:54.767 --> 33:57.868
head and--
called it macaroni.
Okay?

33:57.870 --> 34:00.637
And I don't give a friar tuck
who you are...
[Laughs]

34:00.639 --> 34:04.107
You don't be showing me that
with a meaty tuck like that.
That was a meaty tuck.

34:04.109 --> 34:09.279
As a talk show host, the
biggest thing with her hosting
was her lack of tact, especially

34:09.281 --> 34:14.484
with a sensitive issue.
But what I do appreciate is
the fact that when we did bring

34:14.486 --> 34:18.288
that up to her today, she was
tearful about it, and I felt
that that was very genuine

34:18.290 --> 34:21.291
of her.
All right, up next,
Courtney Act.

34:21.293 --> 34:26.263
Do the other queens just
shit backstage when she puts
on what she's gonna put on for

34:26.265 --> 34:30.801
the runway?
Because that is so impressive.
As far as the talk show goes,

34:30.803 --> 34:35.472
I thought she did a good job,
but then one minute in, she just
plummeted energy-wise.

34:35.474 --> 34:38.275
I didn't feel the energy dip,
honestly.
Nor did I.

34:38.277 --> 34:40.977
It was conversational.
It just worked.
I agree.

34:40.979 --> 34:46.316
I just thought she was very,
very likeable and fun.
I would say that her

34:46.318 --> 34:50.887
and Ben de LA creme were my two
favorite, just neck and neck.
All right, let's move on

34:50.889 --> 34:55.058
to Trinity K. Bonet.
Loved her runway look.
It all worked together.

34:55.060 --> 35:00.363
But it's not strong enough to
make up for how abysmal her
talk show went for her.

35:00.365 --> 35:03.467
Right.
With the biggest faux pas of
all, not knowing the guest's

35:03.469 --> 35:07.304
name.
Hello, she called him Chad.
[Laughs]

35:07.306 --> 35:10.474
So rule number one, know your
guest's name.
All right, silence.

35:10.476 --> 35:15.612
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.

35:15.614 --> 35:27.457
[Laughs]
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.

35:27.459 --> 35:32.863
Bianca Del Rio, you are safe.

35:32.865 --> 35:38.368
Ben de LA creme, you are safe.

35:38.370 --> 35:50.180
Courtney Act, as a talk show
host, you were unflappable,
and on the main stage,

35:50.182 --> 35:55.952
you soared.
Condragulations, you are the
winner of this week's challenge.

35:55.954 --> 36:00.290
Thank you.
[Applause]
You've won a wig wardrobe

36:00.292 --> 36:06.196
from outfitters wig and a year
supply of hair care from aquage.

36:06.198 --> 36:08.265
Second win.

36:08.267 --> 36:14.304
Darienne Lake...
You are safe.

36:14.306 --> 36:24.648
Adore Delano.
You, my dear, are one wild
child, but in this week's

36:24.650 --> 36:30.921
challenge, you were eaten
alive.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are

36:30.923 --> 36:32.989
up for elimination.

36:32.991 --> 36:42.499
Trinity K. Bonet.
On the runway, you are a
fierce, feathered firebird.

36:42.501 --> 36:50.774
Unfortunately, on the talk show,
you laid an egg.
Joslyn Fox, your runway look is

36:50.776 --> 36:57.547
a bungle in the jungle.
In the challenge, you put your
high-heeled foot in your mouth.

36:57.549 --> 37:08.525
Joslyn Fox...
You're safe.
Join the other girls.

37:08.527 --> 37:11.928
Trinity, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

37:11.930 --> 37:19.202
I'm freaking out because I've
seen Trinity send a lot of
bitches home with her lip sync

37:19.204 --> 37:20.904
since she turns it the fuck
out.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.973
I feel like I'm gonna faint.

37:22.975 --> 37:28.278
Ladies, prior to tonight,
you were asked to prepare
a lip-synch performance of

37:28.280 --> 37:37.320
<i>vibeology</i> by Paula Abdul.
This is your last chance to
impress me and save yourself

37:37.322 --> 37:48.498
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip-synch for your life.

37:48.500 --> 37:53.436
Good luck, and don't
