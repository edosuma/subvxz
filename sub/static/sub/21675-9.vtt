30:50.433 --> 30:53.166
So who's cooking
the braai tonight?

30:53.166 --> 30:55.266

Adam and Wes.

30:55.300 --> 30:56.767
- Wonder what they're
gonna talk about.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.533

30:58.567 --> 31:01.033

an open grill though.

That's cool.
We should burn this boat down.

Wes, to me at this point,
doesn't feel like we're friends.

It's kind of like
degraded to small talk.

It just proves that two men

31:25.066 --> 31:27.300
So remember
how on our last charter

31:27.333 --> 31:29.467
our primary broke his phone
in the hot tub?

31:29.467 --> 31:30.467
- Yeah.

31:30.467 --> 31:32.333

to put it in rice?

31:35.033 --> 31:38.166
- He logged in with his Apple ID
on the master iPad.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.467

iPad, and he's texting Hannah.

31:40.467 --> 31:44.066
- Shut up. What?
- It started at 12:30.

31:44.066 --> 31:46.200
- What, after the guys get off?
- During the white party.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.433
- So it happened
when we were on charter.

31:50.333 --> 31:52.066

that's when I was like,

31:52.066 --> 31:53.433
"Whoa, this is f---ed up."

31:56.500 --> 31:59.066
That's not okay 'cause
that makes us all look bad.

the boat then.

It's so much sh--

32:02.066 --> 32:04.100

To me,
Hannah can do whatever she wants

32:05.367 --> 32:07.367
with the charter guests.
I don't care.

32:07.400 --> 32:09.433
What I care about is the fact
that she's talking sh--

32:09.467 --> 32:11.767
about our crew,

32:11.767 --> 32:15.066
and that sucks because
we're supposed to trust you.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.467
- So next charter, right,
if there's some chicks

32:16.500 --> 32:18.433
that are into you
and then she starts to

32:18.467 --> 32:20.333
pull you up and be like,
"Bro, you can't do this--"

professionalism, Max,

on a boat.

32:23.400 --> 32:24.767

- I wouldn't care.

32:26.467 --> 32:28.233

- Shut it.

32:30.533 --> 32:32.367

32:32.400 --> 32:34.166

about meeting up later.

We've got to come up
with some kind of prank.

32:46.266 --> 32:47.767

Hannah though, right?

33:54.433 --> 33:56.266
- No.
- F---. I wish I wasn't

33:56.300 --> 33:57.500

33:57.533 --> 33:59.433
like a sore thumb.

33:59.433 --> 34:01.333

of a sick getup.

34:11.433 --> 34:13.266
to let you in
on what's just happened.

34:13.300 --> 34:15.200
Bobby and I were
in the master,

34:15.200 --> 34:18.333
and the master iPad
was going ping, ping.

34:18.333 --> 34:20.066
It was a conversation
between Hannah

34:20.100 --> 34:22.333
and our primary charter guest.

34:22.333 --> 34:24.200
- Oh, wow.

34:24.233 --> 34:25.734
the boat to see him and stuff.

34:25.734 --> 34:28.033
I was saying
it's very unprofessional.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.467
- I think the risky thing
of this is that

34:29.467 --> 34:31.333
if she might think of it
as, like,

34:31.333 --> 34:32.467
an invasion of her privacy.
That's the only thing

34:32.467 --> 34:34.066
that I think could be touchy

34:34.066 --> 34:36.367

- Yeah.

34:38.200 --> 34:40.333
- Oh, f---, she's on
the other side.

- She's there. She's there.
She's there.

34:42.500 --> 34:45.066
- She already saw us.
We f---ing blew it.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.233
- She's on a march, boy.

34:48.233 --> 34:50.066
Oh, she's turning in
to the boat now.

34:50.100 --> 34:52.200

34:52.233 --> 34:53.433
- Hey.
- What's up?

34:53.467 --> 34:55.300
- Nothin' much.
- No?

34:55.333 --> 34:57.467
- How you guys doing?
- Oh, I left my wallet

34:57.500 --> 34:59.433

- Then we had a little

34:59.467 --> 35:01.100
bromance chat.

35:01.100 --> 35:03.166

"Oh, I'll come with you," and--

35:06.367 --> 35:08.433

- Sour Patch Kids?
- Yeah.

What makes you think
you're getting some of these?

35:19.066 --> 35:23.000
You know I got
a secret stash, right?

35:23.000 --> 35:24.500
- Sour Patch Kids.

35:24.533 --> 35:26.266

do you?

35:26.300 --> 35:28.367

- Hey. What's up?

35:33.233 --> 35:35.100

35:35.133 --> 35:37.000
- You're all dressed up.
You look cute.

I can cook.

Get at it, you.

- Nailed it.

36:24.734 --> 36:28.300

Got this flight in the morning.

36:35.300 --> 36:37.433
I'm gonna tell her
that we know about this.

Too many people know
now that if she finds out,

36:39.433 --> 36:41.433
it's not gonna turn out well.

"Look, we found the messages."

You might be
a little upset with us.

- And you--and you have
every right to be.

37:26.333 --> 37:28.266
Bobs and I were
in the master cabin today,

37:28.300 --> 37:32.066
and the master iPad
was going off with messages,

37:32.100 --> 37:36.367
and I think Jason's phone
is mirroring on it...

37:36.400 --> 37:38.433
and we saw a message
saying he was at the bar.

37:38.467 --> 37:40.767
- That's why me and Max
came to find you.

37:40.767 --> 37:42.233

and speak to you...

37:42.233 --> 37:43.767

"Oh, hey."

37:43.767 --> 37:45.767
We thought we were gonna
find you with him,

37:45.767 --> 37:47.700
that it was gonna be a joke.

37:47.734 --> 37:49.233

you were coming back,

"Oh, f---, joke ruined."

to let you know.

37:53.367 --> 37:55.433
- Oh...

37:55.467 --> 37:58.367
To me, that's like
such an invasion of privacy.

of you reading my messages?

Text someone yourself.

but, like,

she's, like, my best buddy,

and then she's, like,
all funny with me.

texting the primary--

38:28.400 --> 38:30.233

- And Hannah found it.

38:30.266 --> 38:33.266
- Yeah.
- She would lose her sh--.

- You missed out, girl.
- I know.

- Cool.

38:40.233 --> 38:41.767
So what's up?

38:42.000 --> 38:44.667
- The primary had mirrored
his phone

38:44.667 --> 38:47.100
to the iPad,
so all his messages to Hannah

38:47.133 --> 38:48.266
were coming through,
saying that, like,

38:48.266 --> 38:51.333
he wanted to meet up and stuff.

38:51.367 --> 38:53.700
- That sucks.
- What sucks?

38:53.700 --> 38:56.233
- That her personal business

38:58.033 --> 38:59.767
if it's coming through
on the master iPad...

39:01.166 --> 39:03.767
- I don't know.
It is what it is.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.367
Those are personal messages

39:05.400 --> 39:07.233
that were not meant
for anybody else's eyes,

39:07.266 --> 39:09.266
and everyone has access to them?

39:09.300 --> 39:11.033
I would freaking die.

39:11.033 --> 39:13.133
All right, guys, good night.

39:13.166 --> 39:15.233
- Night.
- G'night.

39:15.266 --> 39:18.433
That's two insecure,
shady girls teaming up. Like--

39:18.433 --> 39:20.166
- So maybe tomorrow
I'll just be like,

39:20.200 --> 39:22.300
"Look, Malia
and I have discussed it,

39:22.300 --> 39:24.233
"and you and Lauren seem to be
getting on really well,

39:24.266 --> 39:26.133
and maybe it's just best
if you two live together."

39:26.166 --> 39:27.767
- I think they'd be
a perfect match.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.100

sort itself out.

a long time after that, okay?

how f---ed up this situation is.

41:04.400 --> 41:07.000
Like, it's a violation
of my trust,

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
and it's a violation
of the trust

- Yes.

in the master?

41:32.266 --> 41:33.400
I just want to kind of
give you the heads up

41:33.433 --> 41:35.133
of what's going on

41:35.166 --> 41:39.300
about this charter guest
that just left, Jason.

41:39.333 --> 41:41.400
We had kind of
an instant connection.

41:41.433 --> 41:43.166
Obviously it's a charter guest,

41:43.166 --> 41:45.100
so I try
and keep it professional

41:45.133 --> 41:47.133
while he's on board.

41:47.166 --> 41:52.266
On a late shift he pulled me
aside up here and kissed me,

41:52.300 --> 41:56.500
and I did kiss him back for two
seconds, and then I went, like--

41:56.533 --> 42:01.033
- Wait a minute.
It is not cool to respond

42:01.033 --> 42:03.166
if a charter guest
hits on you.

42:04.300 --> 42:05.700
Wow.

42:05.700 --> 42:09.300
- He kind of messaged me
on social media,

42:09.333 --> 42:12.300
and we were texting yesterday.

42:12.333 --> 42:14.033
- No matter what happens
on charter,

42:14.033 --> 42:16.400
how many times
a guest approach you,

42:16.433 --> 42:18.367
you cannot cross that line.

42:18.400 --> 42:21.200
I don't care who approaches you
and wants to kiss you.

42:21.200 --> 42:23.333
You do not allow it to happen.

42:23.333 --> 42:25.200
You have to use
your common sense.

42:25.200 --> 42:27.166
Maintain your professionalism.
- Yeah.

To make sure that this scenario
doesn't happen again,

I'm taking Hannah off the nights
so the temptation is gone.

42:41.100 --> 42:42.467
- Jesus Christ, what is it?

42:42.467 --> 42:44.266
- I was wondering if today
it could be my day

42:44.300 --> 42:46.000
to take the boat off the dock.
- Absolutely.

42:46.033 --> 42:47.333
- Let's do it.

42:47.333 --> 42:49.166
Well, the worst thing
that could happen

42:49.200 --> 42:51.000
is we could crash the boat.

Really.

giving me the opportunity.

- Yeah.
- Bugs, Bugs, Hannah,

42:56.066 --> 42:58.000
could you pop down
to the main saloon for me?

42:58.033 --> 42:59.467

a chat with Sandy.

43:02.233 --> 43:04.367
I'm gonna swap you guys shifts.
- Okay.

43:04.367 --> 43:06.233
- So she can do
backup lunch service.

43:06.266 --> 43:07.767
- Cool.
- In terms of yesterday,

43:08.000 --> 43:10.433
I would kind of expect you
as my second

43:10.467 --> 43:12.433
and what I thought was my friend

43:12.467 --> 43:15.100
to just kind of come and tell me
instead of spend the whole day

43:15.133 --> 43:16.767
with Bobby reading
personal messages.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.233
To me, that's kind of
a bit gross, but all good.

43:20.233 --> 43:22.100
- The iPad is
the boat's property,

43:22.100 --> 43:24.200
so anything that is on there

43:24.233 --> 43:26.767
is open to the crew
of the boat.

43:26.767 --> 43:30.033
What if it had been the charter
guest after Jason's charter

43:30.066 --> 43:31.500
who'd come across
these messages?

43:31.500 --> 43:34.734
This is a completely
fireable offense.

43:34.767 --> 43:36.300
I do apologize, and that's why

43:36.333 --> 43:38.333
I came and spoke to you
about it last night.

43:38.367 --> 43:40.367
- Yeah, but you didn't come
to me and speak to me about it.

43:40.367 --> 43:43.500
You got Max and Bobby
to come with you.

43:48.333 --> 43:49.000
- I do apologize, and that's why

43:49.000 --> 43:49.300
- I do apologize, and that's why
I came and spoke to you

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
about it last night.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.500
- Yeah, but you didn't come
to me and speak to me about it.

43:54.533 --> 43:55.734
You got Max and Bobby to come
with you, and it--

43:55.767 --> 43:57.133
- Well, they wanted to be

43:57.133 --> 43:59.066
because
they were involved in it,

43:59.100 --> 44:01.367
so I just thought it was right
that we all come clean to you,

44:01.400 --> 44:03.133
and that was--that was it.
- Okay, cool.

44:03.133 --> 44:05.233
- I was thinking that,

44:05.266 --> 44:07.100
because you and Lauren seem
to be getting on really well,

44:07.133 --> 44:09.100
that maybe
she'd move in with you.

44:09.133 --> 44:11.000
Might just ease everything
about--

44:11.033 --> 44:14.133
'cause I can tell there's,
like, sort of tension.

44:14.133 --> 44:16.066

- Okay.

44:16.100 --> 44:17.767
- I'll chat to Malia as well.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.734
- Okay.
- Thank you.

44:19.767 --> 44:23.000
- Lauren, Lauren, Hannah.
Maybe I crossed the line,

44:23.000 --> 44:27.166
but at the same time, to do that
sort of an invasion of privacy

44:27.166 --> 44:28.700

44:28.734 --> 44:30.700
who's just left you
a massive tip,

44:30.734 --> 44:32.433
that, to me, is disgusting.

44:32.467 --> 44:35.700
So I wanted to update
you on a few things.

44:35.700 --> 44:37.767
- Okay.
- Firstly, I'm gonna swap you

44:38.000 --> 44:39.166
and Bugs's shift.
- Okay.

44:39.166 --> 44:40.700
- And, like, obviously the sh--

44:40.734 --> 44:43.033
went down yesterday
with the technology

44:43.033 --> 44:44.300
and the iPad
and things like that,

44:44.333 --> 44:45.767
and I just had a chat
with Bugs.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.433
I know where I stand now,

44:47.433 --> 44:50.300
which is chief f---ing stew
and badass bitch,

44:50.333 --> 44:52.100
so if you want to play
that game with me,

44:52.133 --> 44:53.433
I'm not here to make friends.

44:53.467 --> 44:55.266
I'm here to work,
so we're thinking

44:55.300 --> 44:56.700
about maybe swapping,
so you--

44:56.734 --> 44:58.166
- Cabins?
- Yeah.

44:58.200 --> 45:00.367
- You'll come in with me.
- Really?

45:00.400 --> 45:03.166
- Yeah.

45:03.200 --> 45:05.166
- Yes!

45:05.166 --> 45:07.300
- You look so--
- This is the best day ever.

45:07.333 --> 45:08.734
Everything
about this room switch

45:08.734 --> 45:10.433
is working out in my favor.

45:10.467 --> 45:12.700
I don't have to room
with Ronda Rousey anymore.

45:12.734 --> 45:14.333
I just want to know
which one.

45:14.367 --> 45:16.266
- A lady never tells.
- I like that.

45:16.300 --> 45:18.066
Respect.
- Mm-mm.

45:18.066 --> 45:19.700
- All right.
This is definitely gonna be

45:19.734 --> 45:22.400
a way for me
to get closer with Hannah,

45:22.433 --> 45:24.467
and we'll be able to see
each other more, really.

45:24.467 --> 45:26.700
- Just so you know,
the charter guest,

45:26.734 --> 45:28.700
he pulled me aside
in a corridor

45:28.734 --> 45:30.333
and kissed me.
- Okay.

45:30.333 --> 45:32.000
- And I kissed him back
for a few seconds,

45:32.033 --> 45:33.333
then I went,
"Get professional, honey."

45:33.333 --> 45:35.200
- Yeah.
- "Leave it till after charter."

45:35.200 --> 45:37.700
- I have your back. I mean,
I had to pretty much, like,

45:37.734 --> 45:41.467
defend you last night in front
of the two new roomies, so...

45:41.467 --> 45:44.000
- Why, what were they saying?
- "Oh, that's so wrong.

45:44.033 --> 45:46.300
I can't believe that."
- This is Malia?

45:46.333 --> 45:49.333
That's f---ing rich.
- Yeah, right?

45:49.367 --> 45:51.333
- Ah, yes, you definitely
shouldn't be texting

45:51.367 --> 45:53.233
with a charter guest,
but making out

45:53.266 --> 45:55.333
with two crew members
in the same night, oh, that's--

45:55.367 --> 45:57.200
- That's totally on, you know?
- Totally fine.

46:04.100 --> 46:06.700
- Bugs is moving in with Malia.

46:06.734 --> 46:08.700
- Why?
- 'Cause everyone wants to sleep

46:08.734 --> 46:11.033

haven't figured that out yet.

get any on [murmurs].

- All crew, all crew,
let's get into our whites.

- Get those dirty feet
off my bed.

have the top.

to see your tequila.

So welcome.

- Okay, thank you!
- Great.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.400
- Cheers.
- Right?

47:08.400 --> 47:10.000
- Wow.
- Yeah, yeah.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.667
- So this is the main salon.

47:11.667 --> 47:13.433
- This is amazing.

47:13.433 --> 47:15.367
- The bar.
all: Yes!

47:15.400 --> 47:17.033
- We'll just take
the tequila out

47:17.033 --> 47:18.433
and leave
the rest of the luggage.

47:18.433 --> 47:19.700
- A whole exercise area.
- Yeah, you can sit

47:19.734 --> 47:21.500
in the hot tub, drink champagne,

47:21.533 --> 47:23.300
and watch him work out.
[chatter, laughter]

47:23.300 --> 47:24.433
- This is the easiest luggage.

47:24.467 --> 47:26.233
None of them are my size.

47:26.266 --> 47:28.133
- This is the master.
- Beautiful.

47:28.166 --> 47:30.367
- We can all fit in that bed.
