WEBVTT

00:51.607 --> 00:53.718
I'm bored.

00:53.831 --> 00:55.788
I'm bored!

00:55.901 --> 00:58.658
Daddy, I'm really bored.

00:58.771 --> 01:01.629
I'm bored!

01:01.742 --> 01:03.411
I'm bored.

01:05.314 --> 01:07.971
I'm bored.

01:08.084 --> 01:10.074
I... am...

01:10.187 --> 01:12.209
bored!

01:12.322 --> 01:14.111
Listen, Daddy!

01:15.058 --> 01:17.815
I'm bored!

01:17.928 --> 01:20.685
I am bored!

01:20.798 --> 01:24.590
I am bored, I am bored,
I'm bored, I'm bored!

01:24.703 --> 01:27.860
I'm bored, I'm bored.

01:27.973 --> 01:30.496
Bored.

01:30.609 --> 01:33.000
I'm bored.

01:33.113 --> 01:35.537
Why don't you answer me?

01:35.650 --> 01:39.108
Because "I'm bored"
is a useless thing to say.

01:39.221 --> 01:41.577
I mean, you live in a great,
big, vast world

01:41.690 --> 01:45.082
that you've seen none percent of.

01:45.195 --> 01:48.785
And even the inside
of your own mind is endless.

01:48.898 --> 01:50.288
It goes on forever, inwardly.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.123
Do you understand?

01:52.236 --> 01:56.228
Being the fact that
you're alive is amazing,

01:56.341 --> 01:57.830
so you don't get to be bored.

01:57.943 --> 01:59.978
When you say, "I'm bored"...

02:08.288 --> 02:10.237
Can we play
an in-the-car game?

02:10.350 --> 02:11.351
What game do you wanna play?

02:11.464 --> 02:12.814
One person thinks of an animal

02:12.927 --> 02:14.849
and the other one asks questions.

02:14.962 --> 02:17.385
Okay, all right,
think of an animal.

02:17.498 --> 02:19.020
No, you think of one first.

02:19.133 --> 02:21.056
Okay, I got one.

02:21.169 --> 02:22.858
What is it?

02:22.971 --> 02:24.993
What's what?
What's the animal?

02:25.106 --> 02:26.361
Well, you're supposed to--
you're supposed to

02:26.474 --> 02:27.796
ask questions and then guess.

02:27.909 --> 02:30.710
No, just tell me.

02:32.286 --> 02:33.580
Okay, it's an elephant.

02:35.049 --> 02:36.150
That was good.

02:42.491 --> 02:44.347
Daddy, where are we going?

02:44.460 --> 02:46.683
Pennsylvania.

02:50.767 --> 02:52.389
But we don't even know her.

02:52.502 --> 02:54.658
That's why we're
going to see her.

02:54.771 --> 02:57.154
She's 97, but she may not
be around much longer.

02:57.267 --> 02:58.267
Why?

02:58.380 --> 02:59.596
Where will she go?

02:59.709 --> 03:01.064
He means she's gonna die.

03:01.177 --> 03:02.844
No... Lilly,
please don't.

03:04.447 --> 03:05.802
How do you know she's gonna die?

03:05.915 --> 03:07.236
Everybody dies, Jane.

03:07.349 --> 03:08.838
We...

03:08.951 --> 03:10.273
How do you know?

03:10.386 --> 03:11.908
I didn't die.
Okay, girls, the reason we're going--

03:12.021 --> 03:14.610
Hey, hey, excuse me.

03:14.723 --> 03:16.579
But people--
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

03:16.692 --> 03:18.415
Listen.

03:18.528 --> 03:20.851
The reason we're going
to see your great-aunt Ellen

03:20.964 --> 03:22.386
is because she's very old.

03:22.499 --> 03:25.556
She was born in 19--
in the 1910s.

03:25.669 --> 03:29.127
She... was around
when people went around

03:29.240 --> 03:31.363
in horses and buggies

03:31.476 --> 03:33.298
and the streets were lit
by gas lamps,

03:33.411 --> 03:35.434
like little candles.
Really?

03:35.547 --> 03:37.135
And you don't know what
that time was like

03:37.248 --> 03:39.705
and you can find out,
if you talk to her

03:39.818 --> 03:41.607
and learn from her.

03:41.720 --> 03:44.209
This is a great opportunity
because, y'know,

03:44.322 --> 03:45.544
you're gonna learn
history in school,

03:45.657 --> 03:47.646
but there's nothing like
having somebody in your life

03:47.759 --> 03:49.114
who can give you that connection

03:49.227 --> 03:50.549
to another generation.

03:50.662 --> 03:52.384
Do you love Aunt Ellen?

03:52.497 --> 03:56.188
She sends me a birthday card
every year, my whole life,

03:56.301 --> 03:59.324
and this last year
when I got the card

03:59.437 --> 04:01.527
I wrote back to her and I said,
"Can we visit you ?"

04:01.640 --> 04:02.995
And she wrote back and said yes

04:03.108 --> 04:05.030
and then we made plans by mail.

04:05.143 --> 04:06.532
It took three months

04:06.645 --> 04:08.000
because she doesn't
have e-mail.

04:08.113 --> 04:10.769
She doesn't even have a phone.

04:10.882 --> 04:11.971
Really?

04:12.084 --> 04:12.838
Wow!

04:12.951 --> 04:14.273
Now I wanna meet her.

04:14.386 --> 04:15.386
Me too.

04:29.902 --> 04:31.469
Oh, yeah!

07:27.145 --> 07:28.333
Look at the goose.

07:28.446 --> 07:29.534
Look at the goose,
look at the goose.

07:29.647 --> 07:30.402
Look at the goose.

07:30.515 --> 07:31.603
Whoa.

07:31.716 --> 07:32.504
Where?

07:32.617 --> 07:33.716
Oh, let me see.

08:04.776 --> 08:07.031
I'm bored!

08:07.355 --> 08:12.102
I... am... bored!

08:20.308 --> 08:21.756
This is her house?

08:22.069 --> 08:24.158
Yeah.

08:24.441 --> 08:26.230
You look sad.

08:26.343 --> 08:27.810
Yeah, well...

08:31.015 --> 08:33.672
Listen, girls,
Aunt Ellen is very old

08:33.785 --> 08:35.374
and I don't know if
she can hear well

08:35.487 --> 08:38.244
or what her...

08:38.357 --> 08:41.550
Just whatever happens, I just
need you to roll with it.

08:43.939 --> 08:44.940
Just don't worry about it.

08:45.053 --> 08:46.819
Let's go.

08:46.932 --> 08:48.554
Daddy, do we have an umbrella?

08:48.667 --> 08:51.387
No, just run, come on.

09:22.969 --> 09:24.317
Where is she?

09:24.430 --> 09:25.431
Is she dead?

09:25.544 --> 09:26.972
Lilly.

09:28.574 --> 09:29.574
Hello.

09:31.711 --> 09:32.845
Aunt Ellen?

09:51.897 --> 09:54.253
Hello.

09:54.366 --> 09:56.288
Holy shit.

09:56.401 --> 09:58.122
What's the matter, Daddy?
Nothing.

09:58.235 --> 09:59.402
Hi, hi.

10:01.805 --> 10:05.096
Can you come to the door?

10:05.209 --> 10:07.232
Come to-- Yeah, that'll be
great if you come to the door.

10:07.345 --> 10:08.612
Daddy...

10:18.656 --> 10:19.656
Stay here.

10:22.171 --> 10:23.171
Hi.
Hello.

10:23.284 --> 10:25.184
Hello, Aunt Ellen.

10:25.297 --> 10:28.754
Aunt Ellen, I... do you
remember we were gonna visit?

10:28.867 --> 10:31.958
Oh, yes, I do remember, yes.

10:32.071 --> 10:33.993
Great, well, it's good--
it's nice to see you.

10:34.106 --> 10:36.095
Oh, thank you.

10:36.208 --> 10:38.964
This is Jane and Lilly,
this is my daughters.

10:39.077 --> 10:41.000
Oh... how--

10:41.113 --> 10:43.069
They're--
What nice children.

10:43.182 --> 10:45.505
Very nice.
Yeah.

10:45.618 --> 10:48.275
Where-- where--
where's your wife?

10:48.388 --> 10:50.310
We're divorced, Ellen.

10:50.423 --> 10:53.580
Oh, divorced, oh...

10:53.693 --> 10:54.848
Can we come in?

10:54.961 --> 10:57.651
Of course, come in, come in.
Great, okay.

10:57.764 --> 10:59.253
Come in.
Thank you, okay.

10:59.366 --> 11:02.356
We're going to have a nice visit.

11:02.469 --> 11:04.070
Aren't we?
Yeah.

11:08.509 --> 11:10.498
I guess, uh, I guess
the last time I saw you

11:10.611 --> 11:13.067
I was about 14.

11:13.180 --> 11:16.904
Yes, well... yeah.

11:17.017 --> 11:19.573
Daddy, I'm thirsty.

11:19.686 --> 11:20.941
Oh, can I get her
a glass of water?

11:21.054 --> 11:22.943
Of course.

11:23.056 --> 11:24.979
Kitchen's right through there.
Okay, thank you.

11:25.092 --> 11:26.681
Yes.

11:26.794 --> 11:29.685
Well, sit down, girls.

11:29.798 --> 11:31.432
Let's have a seat.

11:53.956 --> 11:55.378
Okay.

11:55.491 --> 11:57.213
Oh.

11:57.326 --> 12:00.416
I'm sorry I don't have
a lot to offer. you.

12:00.529 --> 12:04.086
I don't keep
my food, y'know, I...

12:04.199 --> 12:05.488
When you're just...

12:05.601 --> 12:09.338
Oh, would you like
to have a nigger toe, huh?

12:11.876 --> 12:13.231
Why do you--

12:13.344 --> 12:15.500
No, thank you very much.

12:15.613 --> 12:18.036
We ate on the road.
I see.

12:18.149 --> 12:20.940
So it's--
How are you?

12:21.053 --> 12:23.775
Oh, I don't know.

12:23.888 --> 12:26.145
I'm all right.

12:26.258 --> 12:29.281
Could you-- could you
crack this nigger toe for me?

12:29.394 --> 12:30.983
Yeah, I got--
I got it, I got it...

12:31.096 --> 12:32.785
I haven't the strength.

12:32.898 --> 12:34.586
That's okay, I got it.

12:34.699 --> 12:38.357
We were hoping you could,
y'know, tell the girls about

12:38.470 --> 12:39.825
when you were younger and, like,

12:39.938 --> 12:41.960
what life was like then,
that kind of thing.

12:42.073 --> 12:45.464
Well, uh...

12:45.577 --> 12:48.000
I've lived all my life...

12:48.113 --> 12:50.168
in the country here

12:50.281 --> 12:54.273
and not much has--
has changed...

12:54.386 --> 12:56.642
where I am.

12:56.755 --> 12:58.944
I stay away from the cities.

12:59.057 --> 13:01.313
I don't like
the hustle and the bustle.

13:01.426 --> 13:02.748
Oh.
Yeah.

13:02.861 --> 13:04.717
Well, we know all about that.

13:04.830 --> 13:06.218
Do ya?

13:06.331 --> 13:08.387
We live in New York City.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.955
Oh, my.

13:10.068 --> 13:12.558
That's no place
to have two young girls.

13:12.671 --> 13:14.159
It's nothing but niggers

13:14.272 --> 13:16.762
and even worse today, I hear.

13:16.875 --> 13:18.275
Why do you keep saying that?

13:19.645 --> 13:21.126
Saying what?

13:21.239 --> 13:22.240
That.
Nothing.

13:22.353 --> 13:23.915
Lilly, don't.

13:25.818 --> 13:29.076
Well, if you're not
gonna eat any nuts,

13:29.189 --> 13:33.079
I'm gonna go find you
some cookies

13:33.192 --> 13:34.414
or something.

13:34.527 --> 13:37.217
I have some
store-bought cookies.

13:37.330 --> 13:40.120
Okay.
And... someplace.

13:40.233 --> 13:42.156
I don't know.

13:42.269 --> 13:44.070
I'll be right back.
All right.

13:48.141 --> 13:50.431
That's a bad word
she keeps saying.

13:50.544 --> 13:51.899
I know.

13:52.012 --> 13:53.334
Yeah, I don't like that word.

13:53.447 --> 13:55.069
Well, it's not a good one.

13:55.182 --> 13:56.871
Why didn't you let me
ask her about it?

13:56.984 --> 13:58.773
Because it's...

13:58.886 --> 13:59.941
I don't want you to upset her.

14:00.054 --> 14:01.809
She's an old lady,
she's from another time.

14:01.922 --> 14:04.279
But you wanted us to
learn about that time.

14:04.392 --> 14:06.414
Yeah, Daddy.

14:06.527 --> 14:08.394
Right?
Mm-hmm.

14:11.031 --> 14:13.499
Y'know, you're right, I--
that's why I brought you here.

14:15.936 --> 14:17.291
You know what,
when she comes back,

14:17.404 --> 14:18.804
you can ask her whatever
you want.

14:30.717 --> 14:31.984
Ellen?

14:35.088 --> 14:36.388
Ellen?

15:00.826 --> 15:02.550
I was reading to my kids
the other night.

15:02.663 --> 15:06.327
We have a rule that if they get
their... teeth brushed...

15:09.138 --> 15:11.527
and their goddamn pajamas on

15:11.640 --> 15:14.396
by 7:30,
I'll read a book.

15:14.509 --> 15:17.699
Those are the rules.

15:17.812 --> 15:20.263
I'm always glad
when they get ready,

15:20.383 --> 15:21.747
'cause I like to read to them.

15:24.251 --> 15:26.073
I do.

15:26.186 --> 15:28.342
I love reading to my girls.

15:28.455 --> 15:30.578
So we read
a book the other night.

15:30.698 --> 15:32.046
We were reading "Tom Sawyer"--

15:32.159 --> 15:33.615
I'm reading them "Tom Sawyer"

15:33.728 --> 15:35.283
because Mark Twain,
great author--

15:35.396 --> 15:36.618
And they're five
and nine years old,

15:36.731 --> 15:38.186
they're young for it
but they catch up to it

15:38.299 --> 15:39.821
and they're fascinated by
the-- all the lang--

15:39.934 --> 15:42.191
He uses big words,
and beautiful writer.

15:42.304 --> 15:45.394
And I picked "Tom Sawyer,"
not "Huckleberry Finn"

15:45.507 --> 15:48.531
because Tom Sawyer is a nice kid.

15:48.644 --> 15:51.601
He goes to school, he goes to
church, he lives with his aunt.

15:51.714 --> 15:55.104
Huckleberry Finn is
a dirty little homeless,

15:55.217 --> 15:57.974
little white-trash creep.

15:58.087 --> 16:00.109
And the main problem

16:00.222 --> 16:02.678
is that he won't
stop saying "nigger."

16:02.791 --> 16:04.679
I mean, 40 times a page.

16:04.792 --> 16:07.916
I can't sit on my daughter's bed

16:08.029 --> 16:10.218
and just say "nigger" all night

16:10.331 --> 16:11.452
and then put her to sleep.

16:11.565 --> 16:14.189
I just ain't gonna do that.

16:14.302 --> 16:16.658
Anyway, I'm reading 'em
"Tom Sawyer"

16:16.771 --> 16:18.460
and it's a real nice book

16:18.573 --> 16:20.028
but then,
all of a sudden, he runs into

16:20.141 --> 16:21.841
Huckleberry Finn on the street.

16:24.946 --> 16:26.534
"And then Tom saw
his friend, Huck Finn."

16:26.647 --> 16:28.804
I'm like, oh, God, okay.

16:28.917 --> 16:30.372
All right, let's take it
easy here, fellas.

16:30.485 --> 16:33.976
Let's just have
a nice, quiet conversation here.

16:34.089 --> 16:35.277
Let's see how this goes.

16:35.390 --> 16:37.546
Huckleberry Finn was carrying
a dead cat.

16:37.659 --> 16:39.048
It's not a good sign.

16:39.161 --> 16:42.330
He's carrying a-- he's walking
around with a dead cat.

16:46.234 --> 16:49.458
Tom Sawyer says, "What ya doing
with a dead cat, Huck ?"

16:49.571 --> 16:52.961
Huck Finn says,
"Gonna cure my warts."

16:53.074 --> 16:54.463
All right.

16:54.576 --> 16:56.244
My kids are fascinated!

17:00.216 --> 17:02.373
"Who told you you could cure
warts with a dead cat ?"

17:02.486 --> 17:04.108
"Well, Tom Wilson did it.

17:04.221 --> 17:05.810
"He learned it from Jack Johnson,

17:05.923 --> 17:07.879
who learned it from
some nigger down the street."

17:07.992 --> 17:09.647
Oh, God.

17:09.760 --> 17:11.916
All right, girls, listen.

17:12.029 --> 17:13.084
Here's the thing.

17:13.197 --> 17:14.797
America...

17:17.467 --> 17:20.724
People would say this
word and it's not a good word

17:20.837 --> 17:22.292
and I don't know why--

17:22.405 --> 17:25.595
I sound like Bill Cosby
right now, like...

17:25.708 --> 17:28.497
Well, people used to say this word

17:28.610 --> 17:32.035
and this is not a nice word
to say.

17:32.148 --> 17:34.680
And so we remember...

17:37.487 --> 17:39.677
I told the girls, y'know,

17:39.790 --> 17:43.081
these boys are racists.

17:43.194 --> 17:47.532
These boys are racists
and they're not nice boys.

17:49.368 --> 17:51.023
I think we can still enjoy
the stories

17:51.136 --> 17:54.226
about the fishin'
and the tradin' and...

17:54.339 --> 17:55.861
It's weird, man, there's a--

17:55.974 --> 17:58.130
Y'know, that's part
of our history

17:58.243 --> 18:00.832
and we gotta--
we have to know it's there,

18:00.945 --> 18:03.634
and how do you cope with
shit in your past that's bad?

18:03.747 --> 18:06.470
Like, how do you try to feel
like a good country

18:06.583 --> 18:11.541
when you've done shitty
things as an entire nation?

18:11.654 --> 18:14.311
How do you take your past
and still feel good?

18:14.424 --> 18:15.613
Y'know, like, I--

18:15.726 --> 18:17.047
When I was eight years old,

18:17.160 --> 18:19.183
I showed my penis to a girl
with Down syndrome

18:19.296 --> 18:21.185
that lived down the street

18:21.298 --> 18:24.690
and I've got to walk around,
living with that every day.

18:24.803 --> 18:26.284
I gotta wake up
as that guy--

18:26.404 --> 18:27.919
I was eight.

18:28.039 --> 18:31.231
If I did it yesterday, it would
be considered a lot worse.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.842
But I'm still
the dude that did that.

18:35.381 --> 18:38.871
I was just a kid,
but this is still the penis

18:38.984 --> 18:42.274
that I showed to the girl
with Down syndrome

18:42.387 --> 18:45.344
by the dumpster behind
Kentucky Fried Chicken.

18:45.457 --> 18:48.447
That happened.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.761
Those were my values
at eight years old.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.822
And I know that's
an awkward thing to equate

18:56.935 --> 19:00.259
to slavery in America...

19:00.372 --> 19:03.830
but it's kind of the same thing

19:03.943 --> 19:06.511
'cause that shit happened here.

19:09.896 --> 19:11.442
How old are you?

19:11.562 --> 19:13.881
You're not gonna ever find out...
Come on.

19:13.994 --> 19:15.416
if I can possibly help it.
Come on.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.151
No!
I can find out, I just--

19:17.264 --> 19:18.853
I know you can,
so you're gonna go

19:18.966 --> 19:20.721
blabbing to everybody.
No, I'm not gonna tell anybody.

19:20.834 --> 19:21.889
Everybody expect a call.

19:22.002 --> 19:23.491
He's gonna tell you
exactly how old I am.

19:23.604 --> 19:25.860
What?
Well, y'know, come on.

19:25.973 --> 19:27.562
I'll tell you secretly.
Okay.

19:27.675 --> 19:30.131
And if you ever blab it
around, I'll kill ya.

19:30.244 --> 19:33.300
Okay, how old are you?

19:33.413 --> 19:35.370
They're all listening, for Christ's sake!
It doesn't matter.

19:35.483 --> 19:37.305
What are you doing ?!
I'm dying to know, just tell me.

19:37.418 --> 19:39.474
I'm gonna tell you in your ear,

19:39.587 --> 19:41.643
and you're lucky.
All right.

19:41.756 --> 19:43.646
I mean, what, is everybody
gonna think you're 32?

19:43.759 --> 19:45.148
I mean, come on.

19:45.261 --> 19:46.282
Well, no.

19:46.395 --> 19:48.352
But have you ever seen me
all dressed

19:48.465 --> 19:50.387
and with makeup on?

19:50.500 --> 19:52.089
I haven't, no.

19:52.202 --> 19:53.524
I'm in the...

19:53.637 --> 19:55.125
How many years does that
take you down, honestly?

19:55.238 --> 19:57.862
I'm 89.

19:57.975 --> 19:59.363
Are you 89, really?

19:59.476 --> 20:01.032
Jesus Christ!

20:01.145 --> 20:03.067
What did I just tell him?

20:03.180 --> 20:05.503
If I never work for you again,
it's okay with me.

20:05.616 --> 20:07.304
What did I just tell him?

20:07.417 --> 20:09.240
I think I heard, like, 39.

20:09.353 --> 20:11.375
Yeah.

20:11.488 --> 20:12.609
So what do you think?

20:12.722 --> 20:13.811
All right, 89, wow.

20:13.924 --> 20:15.312
Is it making you nervous?

20:15.425 --> 20:17.482
No, I think that's amazing.

20:17.595 --> 20:20.417
Well, it's obvious--
it's obvious that

20:20.530 --> 20:22.553
I'm not gonna have Alzheimer's.

20:22.666 --> 20:23.754
No, that's clear,
I think you--

20:23.867 --> 20:25.122
Yes, it's quite clear.

20:25.235 --> 20:27.017
cleared that window, you're fine.
Yeah.

20:27.137 --> 20:28.760
I went to the University of Chicago.
Well, you still smoke.

20:28.873 --> 20:30.294
You still-- you can
smoke cigarettes.

20:30.407 --> 20:33.931
That gives a lot of us--
I've given it up since January.

20:34.044 --> 20:37.600
I never quite inhaled anyway.

20:37.713 --> 20:40.028
So who's gonna give me
a cigarette after this--

20:40.148 --> 20:41.336
We'll share one after this.

20:41.449 --> 20:43.138
Listen, I-- this is
a wonderful company,

20:43.251 --> 20:44.873
otherwise I wouldn't talk to
anybody.

20:44.986 --> 20:47.142
But you all know that

20:47.255 --> 20:50.543
and someone's gonna give me
a cigarette on the way home!

20:50.789 --> 20:53.004
Okay, let's go back to that.
So what do we do now?

20:53.124 --> 20:55.175
Okay, here we go.
Let's roll.
