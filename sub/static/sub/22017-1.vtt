00:00.953 --> 00:04.571
If you love Empire, take a look
what happened last season on Star.

00:04.691 --> 00:06.512
I got a plan. We are
starting a girl group.

00:06.632 --> 00:08.170
You want a stage, sparkle.

00:08.291 --> 00:09.836
We're entering to the Atlanta NextFest.

00:09.956 --> 00:12.129
They need to put in the work
to make it to the next round.

00:12.249 --> 00:15.268
- Yo, we ain't got a manager.
- You need somebody who is gonna act

00:15.388 --> 00:17.812
in your best interests and
I would never lie to you.

00:17.932 --> 00:21.050
The winner of the
million-dollar contract...

00:21.170 --> 00:24.141
Big Trouble!

00:26.114 --> 00:27.931
It's unlikely that you will walk again.

00:28.051 --> 00:29.016
I'm pregnant.

00:29.136 --> 00:33.439
I think y'all would be really good
parents. But I'll never babysit.

00:35.699 --> 00:39.349
The next time you'll put your hands
on a woman... I will kill you.

00:42.613 --> 00:44.119
Background starting at the top.

00:44.239 --> 00:45.892
Back to one.

00:46.012 --> 00:47.756
And action.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:40.844 --> 02:42.908
Push.

02:43.028 --> 02:45.795
Come on, we need you to push
this baby out! Yes, yes!

02:45.915 --> 02:48.142
- Yes!
- Oh, it's a boy!

02:52.456 --> 02:54.397
You had a baby boy, Star.

02:54.517 --> 02:57.619
- You got this.
- You're wrong, sister Carlotta.

02:57.739 --> 02:59.410
Move, I got this.

02:59.530 --> 03:01.163
Move.

03:02.280 --> 03:04.966
You took my kid, I'm taking yours.

03:06.266 --> 03:09.553
- Clean yourself up.
- No!

03:13.593 --> 03:16.896
- You all right?
- Yeah, I just keep having these...

03:17.867 --> 03:19.229
damn dreams.

03:19.349 --> 03:21.832
Girl, you know you went in
last night, Star.

03:24.542 --> 03:25.362
Did I?

03:25.482 --> 03:27.994
And, you know,
I've never done this before

03:28.114 --> 03:29.834
with a new artist.

03:30.492 --> 03:32.477
- You legal?
- Yeah.

03:32.795 --> 03:34.617
Well, you're like...

03:36.066 --> 03:38.684
the second dude I've ever been with.

03:39.267 --> 03:40.951
Really?

03:41.381 --> 03:42.186
Wow.

03:42.306 --> 03:43.687
I know that's crazy.

03:43.807 --> 03:48.498
Well, I like to get to know my
artists on my label pretty intimately.

03:48.812 --> 03:50.360
That's crazy 'cause...

03:50.480 --> 03:54.047
me and my group have been at your label
for five months, and nobody there

03:54.167 --> 03:56.315
seems to be trying to get to know us.

03:56.435 --> 04:00.616
Our album is almost done, and every
single one of your A&Rs is a ghost.

04:00.736 --> 04:01.939
What's up with that?

04:02.059 --> 04:05.642
- Can't keep people around?
- I'm looking for an international vibe.

04:05.762 --> 04:09.013
And if you ain't on that
"Despacito" overseas sound,

04:09.133 --> 04:12.549
- put your clothes on.
- Forget international, man.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.698
We're the best thing
you got on the label.

04:14.818 --> 04:18.127
We just won Atlanta NextFest five
months ago. We're a girl group.

04:18.247 --> 04:20.774
Our job is to make an album...
We did that... your job

04:20.894 --> 04:23.979
is to give it a drop date
and a small tour.

04:24.955 --> 04:27.029
Large mountain to climb.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.686
Shouldn't be too hard.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.377
Listen to this...

04:39.047 --> 04:40.406
and call me.

05:03.552 --> 05:06.102
Carlotta Brown for Lucious.

05:06.414 --> 05:08.405
Bruce, I'm on the damn phone.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.183
Hello, yes.

05:13.303 --> 05:15.979
Um, Lucious was going to hook me up

05:16.099 --> 05:18.248
with one of Empire's
top producers and...

05:20.365 --> 05:23.583
Well, just have him call
me back. Thank you.

05:24.341 --> 05:26.919
Would you give that child a piece
of candy or something? Please.

05:27.039 --> 05:29.726
Sit your ass still, little girl.

05:30.031 --> 05:31.796
You know my baby's tender-headed, Bruce.

05:31.916 --> 05:33.697
Your baby ain't no damn
tender-headed, she nappy-headed,

05:33.817 --> 05:35.380
that's what she is.

05:37.341 --> 05:38.717
Bitch!

05:43.487 --> 05:44.519
Bitch.

05:44.639 --> 05:47.140
You just let Janice clock you.

05:47.260 --> 05:49.313
And you even... You just took it.

05:49.433 --> 05:51.481
It is the opening of my foundation.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.584
- Who next?
- Bruce, turn this up.

05:53.704 --> 05:56.620
- The Hunter Morgan Foundation.
- Turn up the TV.

05:56.740 --> 06:00.724
Very big day. I hope that, um, everybody

06:00.844 --> 06:02.800
from all the news stations
will be there.

06:02.920 --> 06:04.791
It's been five months
since the triple-murder

06:04.911 --> 06:08.232
of Hunter Morgan, Eva Resendez,
and Jahil Rivera.

06:08.476 --> 06:10.709
I miss that little brown come-up.

06:12.337 --> 06:15.038
Still can't believe how it happened.

06:18.579 --> 06:22.312
Imagine somebody walking
into your own damn house

06:22.432 --> 06:24.888
and then mowing your ass down.

06:32.636 --> 06:34.791
While Atlanta Police released
a statement months ago,

06:34.911 --> 06:37.594
authorities are not speaking
to the press at this time.

06:37.714 --> 06:40.120
Arlene Morgan, mother
of the victim Hunter Morgan,

06:40.240 --> 06:43.582
will be hosting a gala for her
foundation tomorrow night

06:43.702 --> 06:45.235
in honor of her son.

06:45.355 --> 06:48.538
Did they find out who killed them yet?

06:49.150 --> 06:50.207
Not yet.

06:50.327 --> 06:51.992
Four Confederate
monuments were taken down...

06:52.112 --> 06:55.289
- Where you been?
- I was out advancing our careers.

06:55.961 --> 06:57.055
Somebody has to.

06:57.175 --> 07:00.501
I was just about to head over to the
label and check in with the A&R rep.

07:00.621 --> 07:03.266
So I don't need you to stay out
all night advancing nothing.

07:03.386 --> 07:05.489
You wouldn't even know
where I was all night

07:05.609 --> 07:07.656
if I still had my own house.

07:07.776 --> 07:11.348
No, you mean that dead white
boy's house that was rented.

07:11.468 --> 07:14.193
Lying ass. And wash yours
before you sit at that table.

07:14.313 --> 07:16.418
Bruce, stop.

07:16.538 --> 07:19.558
I got enough going on with your sister.
I'm fighting to get her back.

07:19.678 --> 07:23.725
I don't need to be worried about
you in jail, or God knows what.

07:25.155 --> 07:27.036
I keep having this baby dream.

07:27.156 --> 07:30.506
That's the Lord telling you
you need to close your legs.

07:31.391 --> 07:33.059
Mm-hmm. Just like that.

07:33.179 --> 07:34.501
Perfect.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.178
Now stay.

07:36.486 --> 07:39.195
Stay. Stay.

07:39.315 --> 07:42.848
- Stay.
- Dreaming about babies is bad omen.

07:42.968 --> 07:45.280
Dream babies and real babies
ain't to be trusted.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.881
Shut up, Bruce.

07:50.251 --> 07:51.927
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:52.677 --> 07:54.973
- Need some help?
- Nah, I'm good.

07:55.093 --> 07:57.911
My mom's coming later.
She wants to help me settle in.

07:58.031 --> 08:00.258
Well, you can come home
any time, you know.

08:00.378 --> 08:02.432
Can you hold this?

08:02.697 --> 08:06.935
Moving in with Derek is a big
step; it means taking care of him.

08:08.359 --> 08:09.638
Star.

08:10.106 --> 08:11.633
Yes.

08:12.869 --> 08:14.573
Did you love him?

08:14.987 --> 08:18.346
Yeah, I loved Hunter.
And it was overrated.

08:19.567 --> 08:22.568
But now my head is in the game.
We're releasing an album.

08:22.688 --> 08:25.542
And, without Hunter,
I don't have any distractions.

08:25.662 --> 08:28.174
Derek is not a distraction, okay?

08:28.294 --> 08:30.920
Okay. Well, you have a lot going on.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.366
And you had a miscarriage that
you won't even talk about...

08:33.486 --> 08:35.890
Don't you have to pick Simone up?

08:59.230 --> 09:00.854
Signing out.

09:01.288 --> 09:05.468
Be back by 10:00 p.m., Davis.
Don't make me call the cops.

09:06.258 --> 09:08.745
She gonna be calling the cops!

09:16.025 --> 09:17.441
Are you high?

09:17.561 --> 09:19.274
- No.
- Simone.

09:20.553 --> 09:23.226
- No, I'm not high.
- You're a liar.

09:23.346 --> 09:25.796
I've been in there, I know
exactly what goes on in there.

09:25.916 --> 09:27.764
Okay, well, I wouldn't even
be... be in here

09:27.884 --> 09:29.403
if Miss Carlotta didn't have
a previous record.

09:29.523 --> 09:30.967
Don't you dare blame Miss Carlotta.

09:31.087 --> 09:35.097
You are in there because you were
smoking weed in school like an idiot,

09:35.217 --> 09:36.579
stupid.

09:37.498 --> 09:39.805
- She's trying to get you out of there.
- Tell her to try harder.

09:39.925 --> 09:43.464
The foster kid system
can't even find me a home.

09:44.575 --> 09:48.174
My plan right now is to get
the label to give us a tour.

09:48.294 --> 09:50.566
That way they'll give you a
work release to get out of here.

09:50.686 --> 09:54.536
But how? We don't even have
a drop date for our album.

10:01.521 --> 10:04.167
I met with the label
president last night.

10:07.509 --> 10:09.735
You slept with him.

10:11.623 --> 10:14.290
- You slept with him.
- I did not say that.

10:14.410 --> 10:17.288
- Yes, you did, ho.
- No, I didn't.

10:17.408 --> 10:18.725
♪ And I'm admitting it ♪

10:18.845 --> 10:20.117
- ♪ I won't take it back ♪
- You can't do that.

10:20.237 --> 10:21.418
♪ 'Cause I did it ♪

10:21.538 --> 10:22.853
♪ I was a ho. ♪

10:24.953 --> 10:26.369
We had a meeting today.

10:26.489 --> 10:28.940
And just in case you forgot,
you are our A&R rep,

10:29.060 --> 10:31.301
and you haven't even heard the music.

10:33.383 --> 10:34.781
Fired?

10:34.901 --> 10:37.525
So who is our new A&R rep?

10:37.645 --> 10:41.091
Mr. Holland, hey. It's Carlotta
Brown, with Big Trouble.

10:41.211 --> 10:42.706
We're still working on a new name.

10:42.826 --> 10:46.034
You know, Star hand-delivered
me that music last night.

10:46.154 --> 10:48.257
And when I tell you she's talented,

10:48.377 --> 10:51.290
I mean a talented young lady.

10:51.410 --> 10:54.410
Yeah, I bet you see talent
like that every night.

10:54.679 --> 10:55.847
Who?

10:56.182 --> 10:57.382
Me...

11:00.460 --> 11:02.746
I don't do that.

11:02.866 --> 11:05.061
Look, the music ain't
that good anyway, all right?

11:05.181 --> 11:06.995
- I-I'm looking for a hit.
- Well...

11:07.115 --> 11:09.640
to be fair about this, we've been
working with your producers.

11:09.760 --> 11:12.869
Now, I got some producers out of New
York that make nothing but hits.

11:12.989 --> 11:14.504
If you would just let us
go up there with them

11:14.624 --> 11:16.473
for a couple of weeks,
knock this thing out,

11:16.593 --> 11:17.908
- we could get this done...
- Hey, hey, hey, look,

11:18.028 --> 11:19.609
look, y'all are all out of time.

11:19.729 --> 11:21.870
They're having a big
board meeting tomorrow.

11:21.990 --> 11:23.914
They're trying to get rid
of their dead weight.

11:24.034 --> 11:27.189
Okay, so what if we have a hot
track for you by tomorrow?

11:27.309 --> 11:29.619
Before your meeting.

11:29.739 --> 11:32.389
That could work. Maybe.

11:32.701 --> 11:36.701
- Okay, well, then you'll have one.
- Good luck with that.

11:42.463 --> 11:45.350
I need to bring
my interior decorator here.

11:45.470 --> 11:47.285
We could be sitting on lice.

11:47.405 --> 11:50.109
- Mom...
- Well, we could.

11:50.229 --> 11:53.124
Anyway, I think I packed
your velvet hangers.

11:53.244 --> 11:55.609
I'm not sure if I could have
put it in this box or...

11:55.729 --> 11:58.006
Wire hangers are okay, Mom.

11:58.126 --> 11:59.664
Look, I know this is Trump's America,

11:59.784 --> 12:02.351
but we still need to have our standards.

12:06.256 --> 12:10.236
I'm very concerned about you.
You're neglecting yourself.

12:10.356 --> 12:13.317
I know this has been a difficult
few months with Derek,

12:13.437 --> 12:15.003
but you matter, too.

12:15.123 --> 12:16.666
You had a miscarriage.

12:18.536 --> 12:20.089
Can we... Can we not?

12:20.209 --> 12:23.145
You know, when I first married
your father, it was all about him.

12:23.265 --> 12:25.147
His music, his needs.

12:25.267 --> 12:27.987
I thought if I made him happy,
I'd be happy, too.

12:28.107 --> 12:30.604
And that thinking drove
me to the bottle.

12:30.724 --> 12:33.147
Are you listening to me, darling?

12:33.267 --> 12:34.871
Cotton's getting out of prison.

12:34.991 --> 12:36.973
She's having wings over at her
place... you should come.

12:37.093 --> 12:38.528
Wings?

12:38.930 --> 12:41.798
I'll be at the Carlton. Come by after.

12:41.918 --> 12:44.177
Mom, come on.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.068
All right.

12:46.375 --> 12:49.156
If you want me there, I'm there.

12:50.726 --> 12:54.143
But this house needs to be
redone. It is really...

12:55.231 --> 12:58.730
Girl, Cotton gonna be
mad at me bringing you down here.

12:58.850 --> 13:00.216
She wanted to surprise you.

13:00.336 --> 13:02.918
I ain't got no time for no more
of Cotton's surprises.

13:03.038 --> 13:05.863
Don't Cotton stay on some type of stunt?

13:05.983 --> 13:07.289
I can't with that girl, honey.

13:07.409 --> 13:10.709
Ain't no telling how she's
gonna come out here looking.

13:14.611 --> 13:15.983
Cott!

13:17.951 --> 13:20.899
Sorry I couldn't come visit.
Bitch, I wasn't coming back down here.

13:21.534 --> 13:22.659
Mmm.

13:22.779 --> 13:25.274
Ooh. Mmm.

13:26.079 --> 13:27.380
I got to wash this hair.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.387
- Hey, Mama.
- Hey, baby.

13:31.867 --> 13:33.349
Damn.

13:33.675 --> 13:37.024
- Girl, how much trade you had in there?
- Shut up, Bruce.

13:37.144 --> 13:38.468
Come on, let's get you home.

13:38.588 --> 13:40.389
I ain't used to you
being shorter than me.

13:40.509 --> 13:44.493
You ain't got no heels on,
ain't got no hair. Ooh.

13:44.754 --> 13:46.822
Don't flop down in my seat like that.

13:46.942 --> 13:50.651
I'm sorry. I know this must be
very difficult for you.

13:52.067 --> 13:55.355
You have no idea how difficult this is.

13:59.970 --> 14:03.679
- How'd you get a jury record?
- Never mind that, sweetheart.

14:04.347 --> 14:06.897
She's killed before.

14:07.585 --> 14:10.714
And I'm not talking about
her sister's foster father.

14:15.210 --> 14:18.361
- You just call me "sweetheart"?
- Excuse me?

14:18.571 --> 14:20.814
Did you just call me "sweetheart"?

14:24.220 --> 14:27.381
Mama, I'm good. Go handle
your business with the girls.

14:27.501 --> 14:31.374
Them girls will be all right.
I want to get you settled first.

14:32.558 --> 14:34.993
I even bought you some new lipstick.

14:36.507 --> 14:38.048
Keys?

14:38.268 --> 14:39.965
To Jahil's car.

14:40.318 --> 14:43.758
I know it's no consolation for
missing his memorial service,

14:43.878 --> 14:45.952
but it's a piece of him.

14:47.766 --> 14:50.429
Things ain't been the same
without you around here.

14:50.549 --> 14:53.666
Shoot, Bruce driving me batty.

14:53.786 --> 14:57.384
And they took Simone
because of my record.

15:01.265 --> 15:03.085
How bad was it?

15:03.205 --> 15:05.224
Prison's prison, Mama.

15:05.344 --> 15:07.009
Ain't nothing changed.

15:09.628 --> 15:11.173
Come on.

15:11.597 --> 15:14.698
Help! I want to go to the men's side!

15:14.818 --> 15:17.437
I know what it's like
to be alone in there.

15:18.906 --> 15:20.823
I wasn't alone.

15:21.306 --> 15:22.658
Sweet thing.

15:22.778 --> 15:24.660
What up, baby girl?
Come get some of this here.

15:24.780 --> 15:26.801
You looking like a snack.
Let me get a bite.

15:32.431 --> 15:35.471
You sure you want
to transfer to gen pop?

15:43.774 --> 15:46.382
Welcome home.

15:46.502 --> 15:48.523
Yeah, welcome home.

15:54.208 --> 15:56.656
Yeah, God takes care of you
wherever you are.

15:56.776 --> 16:01.068
Now, get yourself together so you
can make your grand entrance.

16:01.188 --> 16:02.843
A lot of people waiting to see you.

16:11.875 --> 16:14.343
- Study long, study wrong, baby boy.
- Mm-mm.

16:14.463 --> 16:17.580
- That's one for Bruce?
- I got something for you.

16:18.617 --> 16:20.726
I'm just saying, though, think about it.

16:20.846 --> 16:23.479
Two brown people got killed
with Hunter Morgan,

16:23.599 --> 16:24.687
and just 'cause it's Hunter Morgan,

16:24.807 --> 16:26.489
that's the only reason
they're still reporting on it.

16:26.609 --> 16:28.778
Yeah, and that's the same thing
happened to that young boy

16:28.898 --> 16:32.166
out in Chicago, and the news
didn't cover that.

16:32.286 --> 16:33.729
- Hey, Unc.
- Hey, baby girl.

16:33.849 --> 16:35.157
- How you doing?
- Good.

16:35.277 --> 16:36.789
- Good, good, good.
- Cotton!

16:36.909 --> 16:37.954
Cott!

16:38.074 --> 16:40.254
- She's here!
- Hey, gorgeous.

16:40.374 --> 16:42.705
Cott! She's arrived!

16:45.162 --> 16:47.972
Yo, nephew, what's this, man?

16:48.616 --> 16:51.380
You know I'm not with this, nephew, man.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.495
- I'm going upstairs, man.
- Unc...

16:53.615 --> 16:56.719
I'm going upstairs.
This... Please. Excuse me!

16:56.839 --> 16:59.026
Bye... Unc.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.234
You look good,
but you're late, per usual.

17:03.354 --> 17:05.619
Girl, now, you know you can't
fight a femme-appointed time.

17:05.740 --> 17:07.663
- Now, move over.
- At least you're consistent.

17:07.782 --> 17:10.465
- What's the tea, Cott?
- Girl, oh...

17:10.586 --> 17:14.257
Oh, I got next. All we used to
do is slap bones in the joint.

17:14.377 --> 17:16.672
Oh, I'm sure you slapped more
than one bone, honey.

17:16.791 --> 17:18.840
Ew, Bruce.

17:18.961 --> 17:22.659
- What y'all talking about?
- Injustice in America. You know it.

17:22.779 --> 17:24.246
That's all over for you now, Cott.

17:24.366 --> 17:27.222
I wish. I got to see
my probation officer

17:27.342 --> 17:29.407
once a week, drug test,

17:29.527 --> 17:33.125
and then I got to pay back
Elliot the 20 stacks I stole.

17:33.245 --> 17:35.565
How can he even expect you
to get 20 grand?

17:56.598 --> 17:59.727
Man, what it feel like
not to be able to walk?

18:01.659 --> 18:03.501
How it feel to be a freak?

18:03.995 --> 18:05.584
Derek.

18:07.184 --> 18:09.001
Where's Simone?

18:16.176 --> 18:17.579
I'm sorry.

18:21.195 --> 18:24.183
Here, put a little ranch
sauce on it this time.

18:24.303 --> 18:25.808
Ooh...

18:26.125 --> 18:28.228
God, they're good.

18:34.803 --> 18:37.336
How they been treating you
at that place, little girl?

18:37.456 --> 18:38.859
Horrible.

18:40.882 --> 18:43.692
Should have never taken you
away from Carlotta's.

18:43.812 --> 18:45.361
They can do a random drug test on her.

18:45.481 --> 18:48.906
You should not be encouraging
that child to smoke.

18:49.026 --> 18:53.047
All you got to do is drink a little
coconut water. She'll be okay.

18:53.167 --> 18:54.870
Simone.

18:55.368 --> 18:58.173
- Give me... oh.
- Get in the house.

18:58.935 --> 19:01.701
Ruby, you lucky you drunk.
I'd bust your ass right now for that.

19:01.821 --> 19:04.132
Hey, you better step back, bitch.

19:06.001 --> 19:08.550
Mom, are you serious?

19:08.813 --> 19:11.095
You're eating chicken wings right now?

19:11.215 --> 19:13.355
They're so divine.

19:14.031 --> 19:15.191
They are.

19:15.768 --> 19:18.980
Miss Ruby, you really
smoking out my sister?

19:19.100 --> 19:21.522
You better procreate yourself
somewhere else.

19:21.642 --> 19:23.032
You better get out of here, white girl.

19:23.152 --> 19:26.822
- You don't have any old-ass friends?
- You better move it!

19:26.942 --> 19:28.055
All right.

19:31.416 --> 19:34.677
How am I supposed to get you back if
you're smoking weed outside my house?

19:34.797 --> 19:36.312
- Okay, I know.
- This is pointless,

19:36.432 --> 19:37.880
'cause she doesn't even care.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.179
Well, so is sleeping
with the label president, Star.

19:41.299 --> 19:43.187
- Wait, what?
- You heard me.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.487
I'm trying to get
an album release date for us

19:45.607 --> 19:47.874
so that I can get her a work
release from that group home.

19:47.994 --> 19:51.026
That's not how you get respect
as a woman in this business,

19:51.146 --> 19:53.371
sleeping with some dude
that look like Mike Epps.

19:53.491 --> 19:55.802
Oh, my God, he does look like Mike Epps.

19:55.922 --> 19:57.972
Star don't care about no respect.

19:58.092 --> 19:59.869
All she cares about is being famous.

19:59.989 --> 20:01.615
And what do you care about, Simone?

20:01.735 --> 20:03.734
I'm serious. Alex, it's not funny.

20:03.854 --> 20:05.650
But it is.

20:05.976 --> 20:08.585
- I'm okay.
- Simone, you're not okay.

20:08.832 --> 20:11.497
Neither are you, ever since Hunter died.

20:16.359 --> 20:18.954
Holland listened to the music.

20:19.397 --> 20:21.065
He said there's not one hit.

20:21.185 --> 20:24.126
That's because they've been putting us
with wack-ass producers for months.

20:24.246 --> 20:25.906
Well, we're on the chopping block.

20:26.026 --> 20:28.284
He wants to hear
a new song by tomorrow... a hit.

20:28.404 --> 20:31.433
- Okay, so get us some studio time.
- We don't have time for studio time.

20:31.553 --> 20:33.228
We're gonna do this
right here, right now.

20:33.348 --> 20:34.456
- Write this thing...
- Right here?

20:34.576 --> 20:38.040
Yeah, write it in the kitchen.
That's right. Go get a laptop.

20:39.589 --> 20:41.628
- Real funny.
- I like that.

20:42.495 --> 20:44.320
I got some questions for you.

20:44.440 --> 20:46.026
I need you to come down to the station.

20:46.146 --> 20:47.475
For what?

20:47.595 --> 20:49.563
The murder of Hunter Morgan.

20:53.249 --> 20:56.372
Star... my old friend.

20:57.327 --> 20:58.811
I miss you.

20:58.931 --> 21:02.880
- I miss Otis.
- Oh, funny girl, huh?

21:03.845 --> 21:05.780
Watch this!

21:09.156 --> 21:10.754
That's some good work.

21:10.874 --> 21:13.499
So why am I here?
'Cause I have someplace to be.

21:13.619 --> 21:16.527
You said he beat you, but the
truth is you never reported it.

21:16.647 --> 21:19.012
And now we have a source
that's providing evidence

21:19.132 --> 21:21.183
that's challenging your veracity.

21:21.303 --> 21:23.883
I know what that is... My juvie
records are supposed to be sealed.

21:24.003 --> 21:26.065
Yeah, we're able to take a little peek.

21:26.185 --> 21:28.931
And you seem to have a history
of violent behavior.

21:29.051 --> 21:32.443
- Since you were 12.
- You know what I have?

21:32.563 --> 21:36.364
Every picture of every time
that man put his hands on me.

21:36.484 --> 21:39.885
I have every weak-ass text message,
too, saying he was sorry.

21:40.005 --> 21:42.912
And the only reason that you haven't
seen these photos is because he is dead,

21:43.032 --> 21:45.954
and I know he couldn't
hurt anybody else.

21:46.074 --> 21:48.719
Every man I've ever known
has left me, or worse.

21:48.839 --> 21:53.580
And what I did when I was 12,
when I was surviving,

21:53.988 --> 21:57.434
that has nothing to do with the
fact that that man beat my ass.

21:57.554 --> 22:00.308
How is that for veracity?

22:11.283 --> 22:13.201
You can go.

22:29.686 --> 22:31.268
You'd have thought
I was gone for ten years

22:31.388 --> 22:33.137
the way y'all done messed my books up.

22:33.257 --> 22:36.173
Girl, that's your mama,
trying to get her coin.

22:36.293 --> 22:38.008
She got behind on all them bills.

22:38.128 --> 22:39.943
Behind how?

22:41.045 --> 22:43.580
She had to mortgage the salon
to pay for your lawyer.

22:52.801 --> 22:54.498
- You guys hear me?
- Yeah.

22:54.618 --> 22:56.927
I think I found the
perfect name for the song.

22:57.047 --> 22:58.762
"Bad Bish."

22:59.429 --> 23:01.098
"Bish"? Are you saying "bish"?

23:01.218 --> 23:02.716
- Yeah, "bish."
- Really?

23:02.836 --> 23:04.355
Yeah, it's like, it's "bitch,"

23:04.475 --> 23:06.879
- but with a "sh," like, shh.
- Simone.

23:06.999 --> 23:09.323
I know what it's supposed to mean.

23:09.443 --> 23:11.575
- Like "Shh."
- I think it's... Shh!

23:11.695 --> 23:13.204
I think it's corny.

23:13.324 --> 23:15.810
Well, how about you come up with
a suggestion, then, smartass?

23:15.930 --> 23:19.095
How about, uh, "Bitch"?
Just the regular word? The way it is?

23:19.215 --> 23:21.139
Okay, can we use our adult voices?

23:21.259 --> 23:23.587
I mean, who cares what it's called?
Let's just finish the record.

23:23.707 --> 23:26.807
You have us working in here
like there's no child labor laws.

23:26.927 --> 23:28.617
Simone, we're in a girl group.
This is what we do.

23:28.737 --> 23:30.908
- Oh, I can't take this.
- Something's wrong with the song.

23:31.028 --> 23:35.102
We got to speed it up or
something. Can we try 120 BPM?

23:35.222 --> 23:36.867
Alex, why are you back
on that damn phone?

23:36.987 --> 23:38.269
Don't you know how important this is?

23:38.389 --> 23:41.115
- Because I have to call Derek.
- That boy's a distraction.

23:41.235 --> 23:43.551
Don't start. I really
don't need that from you.

23:43.671 --> 23:46.405
Okay, maybe we can come in
faster with the drums, Anthony.

23:46.525 --> 23:48.879
Or maybe if Star wasn't so fast
with the label president,

23:48.999 --> 23:50.747
we wouldn't be in this position
in the first place.

23:50.867 --> 23:52.730
At least I was trying to do
something to get us ahead.

23:52.850 --> 23:54.751
- Come on, y'all.
- And look at you.

23:54.871 --> 23:56.642
You're on your phone now, huh?

23:56.762 --> 23:58.822
I'm on my phone telling Cotton,

23:58.942 --> 24:01.460
"No, we can't go out tonight,
because we are in the studio working."

24:01.580 --> 24:04.728
- Okay.
- Give me the phone. Come on.

24:04.848 --> 24:07.865
Don't say nothing weird
or embarrassing, or...

24:07.985 --> 24:10.056
We 'bout it, 'bout it tonight.

24:10.176 --> 24:12.535
- Definitely coming thoo.
- You're doing that on purpose.

24:12.655 --> 24:15.439
- It's gonna be lit.
- Okay.

24:15.559 --> 24:18.108
Come on, y'all need to go out.
Y'all done hit a wall.

24:18.228 --> 24:20.839
Go have some fun. Get-get inspired.

24:20.959 --> 24:23.001
Me and your mother always used to do it.

24:23.121 --> 24:25.915
I mean, you heard the lady,
let's get "lit."

24:26.035 --> 24:28.854
You ain't going nowhere.

24:28.974 --> 24:31.415
- You got a curfew.
- Great.

24:32.209 --> 24:34.987
Guess I'm-a go out with yo' ass.

24:38.365 --> 24:41.335
Yeah, I know, it's our
first night, I'm sorry.

24:41.455 --> 24:45.035
No, don't be sorry.
You got to finish your song.

24:45.233 --> 24:47.113
Can you hurry home tonight?

24:47.233 --> 24:49.406
'Cause...

24:49.526 --> 24:51.356
I was thinking of trying
some physical therapy.

24:51.476 --> 24:53.189
- Oh, were you?
- Yes, I was.

24:53.309 --> 24:54.813
Alex.

24:55.077 --> 24:57.456
Okay, well, I'm definitely
gonna hurry home.

24:57.576 --> 24:58.769
This bitch...

24:58.889 --> 25:00.851
- Okay, I love you.
- I love you, too.

25:18.955 --> 25:20.804
- Oh, I know who that is.
- Back up.

25:22.519 --> 25:25.209
I'm white, not see-through.

25:26.299 --> 25:29.213
- That's Noah Brooks.
- Yeah, his boy just pushed me.

25:31.268 --> 25:34.184
Look, this is about the only
club he can get it popping at

25:34.304 --> 25:37.078
after he got arrested. Ignore them.

25:38.128 --> 25:39.811
Have you ever heard his first album?

25:39.931 --> 25:42.559
My dad said it was like if
Maxwell and Marvin had a baby.

25:42.679 --> 25:45.418
- It was hot.
- It had five hits out the gate.

25:45.538 --> 25:48.979
- Did he produce that, too?
- Yep.

25:50.205 --> 25:52.205
You got that song we've been working on?

25:52.325 --> 25:54.902
- Yes, why?
- I'm-a play it for him.

25:55.022 --> 25:58.528
We're standing five feet away from
a hit maker when we need a hit.

25:58.648 --> 25:59.917
Watch this.

26:02.920 --> 26:05.293
Don't embarrass me!

26:05.413 --> 26:08.331
I'm babysitting. That's what I do.
I babysit bitches... okay.

26:08.451 --> 26:10.332
Welcome home.

26:11.004 --> 26:13.008
I got to get a job and pay my mama back.

26:13.128 --> 26:15.836
My manager is hiring at the bank.

26:15.956 --> 26:18.664
Hey, Dallas, I just got arrested
for passing bad checks.

26:18.784 --> 26:20.061
You think they gonna hire me?

26:20.181 --> 26:23.503
Ladies, what y'all drinking on?

26:27.128 --> 26:29.428
Come on, man, you too sexy. You
need to come with me and slide

26:29.548 --> 26:31.760
through the city or something.

26:37.647 --> 26:40.663
How you doing? Loved your first album.

26:40.783 --> 26:43.789
Even loved your second album.
My name is Star.

26:44.239 --> 26:45.541
Noah.

26:46.866 --> 26:48.969
Excuse me, baby, could you move?

26:49.089 --> 26:50.835
We're trying to do business.

26:55.480 --> 26:58.784
- Anyway, this is, um...
- Wait. Ain't you somebody's daughter?

26:58.904 --> 27:01.318
Yes, I'm somebody's daughter.

27:01.438 --> 27:04.053
- What's the occasion?
- Figured in exchange for that bottle,

27:04.173 --> 27:07.040
you could listen to one of our songs?
Tell us what you think is missing.

27:07.160 --> 27:10.457
Baby, if you wanted to go home with me,
all you got to do is ask. It's simple.

27:10.577 --> 27:13.988
I'd focus on your next hit,
not your next piece of ass, Noah.

27:14.108 --> 27:15.756
There's room for three.

27:15.876 --> 27:17.907
Now, come on, baby, I-it's all good.

27:18.027 --> 27:20.993
Dude, nobody's trying to go home
with you. We just said that.

27:21.113 --> 27:22.455
Are we?

27:25.185 --> 27:28.133
Look, we're just trying to give your
played-out ass some juice, honestly.

27:28.253 --> 27:30.924
We are in the hottest girl group
coming up right now.

27:31.044 --> 27:32.504
You're a good R&B singer,

27:32.624 --> 27:35.170
but when's the last time
you put out an album?

27:35.290 --> 27:36.692
Look, nobody's checking
for you right now.

27:36.812 --> 27:39.372
But if you produced a song on
our album and it became a hit,

27:39.492 --> 27:43.121
well, maybe your fans would
wonder what you were up to.

27:43.241 --> 27:46.673
But I guess you got
everything you need in the VIP.

27:46.793 --> 27:49.444
So I'll just take that.

27:49.564 --> 27:53.170
- Have a good one.
- Wait, you gonna take the bottle?

27:53.290 --> 27:55.058
Oh, this wasn't a gift, love.

27:55.178 --> 27:57.234
This was an exchange,
and you gave me nothing.

28:00.478 --> 28:02.896
Well, that was a time suck.

28:03.016 --> 28:05.513
- Now what?
- I don't know.

28:05.946 --> 28:08.693
You're the one with all the thirsty
ideas. Why don't you tell me?

28:08.813 --> 28:10.660
You're the one who got into Juilliard.

28:10.780 --> 28:12.834
- Why don't you figure it out?
- Okay, well, first we have...

28:12.954 --> 28:15.610
Come on, now, you ain't
got to be all like that, mamas.

28:15.730 --> 28:17.428
What, you think you too pretty
for me or something?

28:17.548 --> 28:19.802
- We ain't interested.
- What?

28:19.922 --> 28:23.171
Bitch, you ain't all that.
Y'all ain't doing nothing.

28:23.291 --> 28:25.715
Looking like old fake-ass
Blac Chyna, bitch.

28:25.835 --> 28:29.778
- First of all...
- Cott, Cott. You're on parole, okay?

28:29.898 --> 28:32.157
She's right. I got this.

28:35.059 --> 28:37.078
I will beat your ass

28:37.198 --> 28:39.660
if you put your hands on her, bitch.

28:39.780 --> 28:41.751
And that's on the real.

28:41.871 --> 28:43.897
You don't want these problems.

28:47.310 --> 28:48.860
Oh!

28:49.099 --> 28:51.767
- Look.
- His face, he was so shook.

28:51.887 --> 28:55.262
That bullying stuff is
on some next-level ish now.

28:55.382 --> 28:57.146
I don't like that. But you know what?

28:57.266 --> 29:00.587
I preach the word of whoop ass.
Can the church get an "amen"?

29:00.707 --> 29:02.310
- Amen.
- Amen.

29:07.379 --> 29:08.617
Wait.

29:09.258 --> 29:10.786
Star, listen, you hear that?

29:11.420 --> 29:13.388
- Oh, what, the beat?
- Yeah.

29:14.340 --> 29:16.391
Think I got an idea.

29:18.685 --> 29:20.280
- Simone?
- Hey, yeah.

29:20.400 --> 29:23.695
- Can you hear this song?
- Yeah, it's so dope.

29:23.815 --> 29:25.375
Your part is really sick.

29:25.495 --> 29:27.569
I have it all written out in my head.

29:27.689 --> 29:30.806
- I promise you, it'll be fire, okay?
- Okay.

29:30.926 --> 29:32.716
Oh, you missed one tonight, Simone.

29:32.836 --> 29:34.274
I really wish you were there.

29:34.394 --> 29:36.601
Dallas pulled this man
voice on this dude

29:36.721 --> 29:39.783
and shook him to his core,
it was hilarious.

29:39.903 --> 29:42.486
Out of nowhere, she goes,
"Bitch, I will whoop

29:42.606 --> 29:44.487
your ass."

29:44.607 --> 29:46.653
- He ran, both feet.
- He shut up so quick.

29:46.773 --> 29:50.129
I know we're being too loud,
but I'm-a come get you early.

29:50.249 --> 29:51.851
- Okay.
- Night.

29:51.971 --> 29:55.181
Star. Please get me out of here.

30:07.562 --> 30:09.600
We know who you is.

30:11.319 --> 30:14.746
- I like your shoes, baby.
- Come up off 'em.

30:14.866 --> 30:17.974
- I ain't giving y'all nothing.
- Yes, you is.

30:18.094 --> 30:20.248
Don't you want to be like Zendaya?

30:44.725 --> 30:45.819
What?

30:45.939 --> 30:48.215
I'm just playing.

30:48.335 --> 30:51.098
- Don't do that. Give me my headphones.
- It sounds perfect.

30:51.218 --> 30:53.545
It sounds good.

30:53.665 --> 30:55.180
Look, I know we're tired.

30:55.300 --> 30:57.981
And I know you have a lot going
on, especially, but...

30:58.101 --> 30:59.984
we got to get this right.

31:00.104 --> 31:02.441
I know you probably don't
want to talk about it,

31:02.561 --> 31:05.691
or you don't want to talk to me,
I don't know what it is,

31:05.811 --> 31:09.061
but... are you
at least talking to Derek?

31:09.181 --> 31:10.984
I'm not putting anything else
on his plate.

31:11.104 --> 31:13.966
Alex, that's not putting
something on his plate.

31:14.086 --> 31:16.386
Y'all went through
a miscarriage together.

31:17.745 --> 31:19.302
That's his life, too.

31:19.422 --> 31:22.140
Yo, you have to talk to him about it.

31:22.260 --> 31:24.546
- Okay.
- Okay.

31:26.229 --> 31:28.874
And then let's get this money.
I'm gonna go get Simone.

31:28.994 --> 31:30.615
I already got her.

31:30.735 --> 31:32.295
Come on, Simone, learn the song.

31:32.415 --> 31:34.488
Alex, you been here all night,
go check on your man.

31:34.608 --> 31:36.299
Star, I need you to go
downstairs and refill

31:36.419 --> 31:38.372
all those conditioner bottles
at every station.

31:38.492 --> 31:40.292
Why do I have to work in the salon?

31:40.412 --> 31:44.120
'Cause I said so. I'm-a get Holland
on the line. Come on, let's get it.

31:44.240 --> 31:47.283
I swear, she does it on purpose.

31:47.935 --> 31:49.308
You ready?

31:49.635 --> 31:53.219
Something has to happen.
I can't live like this anymore.

31:53.339 --> 31:56.641
No, no. Mr. Holland said he wanted
to see us before the meeting.

31:56.761 --> 31:58.210
So just tell him we'll be there.

31:58.330 --> 32:00.430
Thanks.

32:05.436 --> 32:07.085
What's the matter?

32:07.417 --> 32:09.665
I was gonna sell his car,

32:09.785 --> 32:12.175
but then this fell out the visor.

32:17.314 --> 32:19.431
I gave it to him.

32:19.551 --> 32:21.099
He wanted it.

32:22.740 --> 32:24.136
You miss him?

32:25.353 --> 32:27.492
Let's not talk about that
right now, Cotton.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.275
Now why are you trying to sell his car?

32:29.395 --> 32:31.681
Because you mortgaged
the salon for me, Ma.

32:31.801 --> 32:33.353
Who told you that mess? Bruce?

32:33.473 --> 32:36.481
You and Grandma worked
so hard for the salon.

32:36.601 --> 32:40.039
And I wanted that surgery so bad,
I stole from Elliot, and for what?

32:40.159 --> 32:43.000
Look, look, I know
you're gonna pay me back

32:43.120 --> 32:45.627
'cause you're a hustler
just like your daddy.

32:45.747 --> 32:49.003
No. I get that hustle from you, Ma.

32:52.204 --> 32:55.567
Hey. We got that song.

32:56.372 --> 33:00.195
- Don't you want it?
- This is not the time, ladies.

33:00.928 --> 33:03.408
Look, you know I'm not
taking no for an answer.

33:03.850 --> 33:06.445
- Right?
- Alex, play the track.

34:58.376 --> 35:00.623
You wanted an international sound?

35:00.743 --> 35:03.762
- We delivered.
- That's exactly what I was looking for

35:03.882 --> 35:06.510
- five months ago when I signed you.
- Five months ago?

35:06.630 --> 35:08.934
'Cause you asked for it last night.

35:09.054 --> 35:11.136
Well, we got a lot more
where that came from.

35:11.256 --> 35:12.663
Well, it don't matter.

35:12.783 --> 35:15.876
I just went up in that
board meeting and got fired.

35:15.996 --> 35:19.295
- Yeah, they got a new head coming in.
- Makes sense.

35:20.363 --> 35:23.210
- Who is it?
- You ever heard of the Floyd family?

35:23.330 --> 35:26.590
Yeah, who hasn't? Wait,
Charles Floyd bought this label?

35:26.710 --> 35:29.372
No, his daughter did.

35:30.265 --> 35:32.241
And she's a bad bitch.

35:34.010 --> 35:35.951
Good luck, ladies.

35:39.804 --> 35:42.087
Alex, please tell me
you know this woman.

35:42.207 --> 35:43.517
Yeah, I do.

35:43.637 --> 35:45.455
She's trouble.

35:48.127 --> 35:49.848
Ayanna Floyd.

35:50.333 --> 35:52.486
Well, when is she leaving New York?

35:52.901 --> 35:55.419
No, I don't want to be...
don't put me on...

35:56.562 --> 35:58.018
hold.

35:59.694 --> 36:02.124
Come on, girl, I got to get
you back on time.

36:02.244 --> 36:05.091
- I don't want to go back to that place.
- I know, baby.

36:05.211 --> 36:07.764
I don't even know what's going on.
It's like we're cursed or something.

36:07.884 --> 36:09.993
Star is still upset over Hunter,
Alex lost a baby,

36:10.113 --> 36:13.384
and I'm stuck in that freakin' hellhole.
And all we want to do is sing.

36:13.504 --> 36:17.729
I'm not gonna let this label president
stop you from doing that, either.

36:17.849 --> 36:19.342
- I'm-a fix this.
- How?

36:19.462 --> 36:21.582
I'm going back to New York.

36:21.702 --> 36:24.670
- The Lyons owe me.
- That's not a bad thing.

36:25.058 --> 36:27.554
No, it definitely ain't. Yeah.

36:27.674 --> 36:30.334
- My wig straight?
- Straight as those people downstairs.

36:41.751 --> 36:45.913
You know the drill. No touching,
they can only put money in the G-string,

36:46.033 --> 36:47.632
and no pictures.

36:47.752 --> 36:51.060
But when I called earlier, you
said that someone requested me.

36:51.180 --> 36:53.421
He's in there. Hit it.

37:02.468 --> 37:04.100
Hi, baby.

37:06.745 --> 37:08.765
I heard you were home.

37:15.620 --> 37:17.727
How are you? Okay?

37:19.525 --> 37:22.094
You know, all we talk about is me.

37:22.214 --> 37:24.623
I want to talk to you, too.

37:27.195 --> 37:29.030
It's like...

37:30.627 --> 37:32.206
ever since the miscarriage,
you don't want...

37:32.326 --> 37:34.315
We don't have to talk about that.

37:35.727 --> 37:37.209
All right.

37:52.706 --> 37:54.215
Stop.

37:57.842 --> 37:59.195
Okay.

38:05.256 --> 38:07.815
It's okay. We're good.

38:17.006 --> 38:19.900
I can't believe I'm having an abortion.

38:22.017 --> 38:23.234
Ten...

38:23.883 --> 38:25.215
nine...

38:25.894 --> 38:27.191
eight...

38:27.491 --> 38:28.967
seven...

38:29.894 --> 38:31.409
six...

38:31.754 --> 38:34.045
five... four...

38:35.449 --> 38:37.849
three... two...

38:38.945 --> 38:40.489
one.

38:41.792 --> 38:43.568
I'm gonna tell you the truth right now.

38:43.688 --> 38:47.971
When you lose a son,
you need to think positive.

38:49.188 --> 38:52.297
Excuse me. Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Do you have any questions?

38:52.417 --> 38:54.495
That's perfect,
just hold that... hold it.

38:54.615 --> 38:57.602
Look out for Big Trouble
this fall. Thank you.

38:57.722 --> 39:02.202
Trying to do something
that will lift people's spirits.

39:02.322 --> 39:04.750
That's the kind of person I am.
That's what this foundation...

39:04.870 --> 39:07.905
Can I get one
of the two of you together?

39:09.934 --> 39:11.514
- How are you?
- Beautiful, Star.

39:11.634 --> 39:13.337
- One more, please.
- Excuse me, Melanie.

39:13.457 --> 39:15.853
- One moment.
- Excuse us, Melanie.

39:17.450 --> 39:19.457
You little bitch,
what are you doing here?

39:19.577 --> 39:21.159
Oh, keep it together, Arlene.

39:21.279 --> 39:23.094
There are photographers everywhere.

39:23.214 --> 39:25.295
Just keep a smile on your face.

39:27.429 --> 39:30.668
You and I both know
you raised a monster, Arlene.

39:30.942 --> 39:33.857
- And I've got the pictures to prove it.
- Yeah?

39:33.977 --> 39:36.040
- Stop digging into my past...
- Hmm.

39:36.160 --> 39:37.909
- And I won't dig up yours.
- Well...

39:38.029 --> 39:39.829
- Understood?
- Sure.

39:41.943 --> 39:43.915
I found your juvie records.

39:44.035 --> 39:47.648
You're a murderer
and you murdered my son.

39:50.502 --> 39:53.708
I truly wish that I had.

39:54.131 --> 39:56.372
Great shot. Smile, Ms. Davis.

39:56.492 --> 39:58.548
Hello. How are you?

39:58.668 --> 40:02.399
Everybody look for Big Trouble's
debut album. It's coming soon.

40:02.519 --> 40:05.087
- Thank you so much.
- One more, please.

40:07.104 --> 40:08.806
Why you got my ass here anyway, boy?

40:08.926 --> 40:11.088
Aunt Carol,
just shut up and chill, okay?

40:11.208 --> 40:14.106
And just remember that she don't know
nothing about Dad's memory loss.

40:14.226 --> 40:15.730
Uh, Miss Brown?

40:16.515 --> 40:18.172
Carlotta.

40:18.508 --> 40:21.331
Mally Mal, you're doing good, boy.

40:21.451 --> 40:23.261
I used to take care of you
when you was a baby.

40:23.381 --> 40:24.944
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

40:25.064 --> 40:26.723
Carol.

40:27.900 --> 40:29.461
But I wasn't expecting to see y'all.

40:29.581 --> 40:31.362
I was actually expecting
to see your father here.

40:31.482 --> 40:35.266
- M-My dad couldn't make it.
- 'Cause something's wrong with him.

40:37.473 --> 40:40.171
'Cause he got busy.

40:40.291 --> 40:42.307
Anyway, my mom,
she insisted that I come.

40:42.427 --> 40:45.777
Said it was a priority that
I help an old family friend.

40:46.389 --> 40:49.148
Miss Carlotta,
what you got on my parents?

40:49.268 --> 40:51.698
They're not just gonna jump for anybody.

40:51.818 --> 40:53.536
We ain't got the time.

40:53.656 --> 40:56.202
Well, look, it's still probably
the best thing that I came.

40:56.322 --> 40:58.976
Yeah, she probably gonna want
to see your fine ass, anyway.

41:00.226 --> 41:02.060
I bet them dimples get you in trouble.

41:02.180 --> 41:04.629
- Me, I do all right.
- I bet you do.

41:04.749 --> 41:08.384
- You just sit your little ass here.
- Well, you just hurry your ass up.

41:12.316 --> 41:14.575
Ayanna, what's good?

41:15.519 --> 41:17.108
I cleared the pool for you.

41:17.228 --> 41:20.252
Oh, so you fancier
than my mama now, huh?

41:20.372 --> 41:25.019
Need to get you loosened up so we can
talk about bringing you over to my label.

41:25.139 --> 41:27.976
Well, first things first.
Carlotta Brown, meet Ayanna Floyd.

41:28.096 --> 41:31.329
Ayanna is the president of y'all label.
And Carlotta, she's, um...

41:31.449 --> 41:33.320
Mixed Harmony.

41:33.440 --> 41:34.713
I'm familiar.

41:35.793 --> 41:39.167
Well, actually, I'm managing now
and my girls are signed to your label.

41:39.287 --> 41:40.899
I know that.

41:42.245 --> 41:44.836
And you came here wanting to know
what I have planned for them,

41:44.956 --> 41:47.246
and you thought ambushing me with a Lyon

41:47.366 --> 41:49.285
would get my attention.

41:49.612 --> 41:51.663
I don't like being ambushed.

41:51.783 --> 41:53.728
Why you being shady? Come on, Ya-Ya.

41:53.848 --> 41:56.347
Shut up, Jamal.

41:57.337 --> 42:00.740
Well, my girls have been working
really hard since Atlanta NextFest.

42:00.860 --> 42:02.053
I just want to see...

42:02.173 --> 42:05.204
Set up an appointment with my assistant.

42:05.895 --> 42:07.759
And Carlotta...

42:07.879 --> 42:10.173
don't try to play me again.

42:12.583 --> 42:14.198
- I'm sorry.
- There's been breaking news

42:14.318 --> 42:15.900
in the Hunter Morgan case.

42:16.020 --> 42:18.636
Leonard Kramer has been arrested
as a suspect for the murders

42:18.756 --> 42:22.330
of Hunter Morgan, Eva Resendez,
and Jahil Rivera.

42:22.450 --> 42:25.158
More about this case amid new evidence.
