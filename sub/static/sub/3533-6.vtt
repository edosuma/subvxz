WEBVTT

00:04.985 --> 00:08.083
I mean, I lost everything.
I lost my... My... My job,

00:08.118 --> 00:10.954
my friends, my...
My future.

00:10.988 --> 00:13.958
But I don't know. In that loss,
you know, I feel like I've...

00:13.993 --> 00:15.360
I've found something.

00:15.394 --> 00:19.266
I mean, I found this group.
I found all you guys.

00:19.300 --> 00:21.035
That's right.

00:21.069 --> 00:23.505
For the first
time in a long while

00:23.539 --> 00:28.178
I can 100 percent
motherfucking honestly say...

00:30.281 --> 00:32.750
I feel good.

00:35.321 --> 00:37.455
There you are.

00:37.489 --> 00:39.657
Hey, man.
Hey.

00:39.692 --> 00:41.526
So I just heard the news.

00:41.561 --> 00:43.896
Sounds like
you're ready to move on.

00:43.930 --> 00:45.197
I think I am.

00:45.231 --> 00:47.867
You know what's next, don't you?
Yeah.

00:47.901 --> 00:50.270
Ninth step.
Make amends.

00:50.304 --> 00:52.406
That's right.

00:52.441 --> 00:54.909
Take that list you made of all
the people you've wronged.

00:54.944 --> 00:58.513
Start at the top, the person
you fucked over the most.

00:58.548 --> 01:00.916
Andrew, uh, seriously,

01:00.951 --> 01:03.052
like, there's no way
I would have made it

01:03.087 --> 01:05.021
over the last six months
without you.

01:05.055 --> 01:07.557
So it's actually convenient
that you're here with me now.

01:07.592 --> 01:10.394
Oh. Heh-heh. Wanna ask your
old sponsor one more question?

01:10.428 --> 01:11.595
Nah.
Go ahead.

01:11.629 --> 01:13.497
No, I meant actually
it's convenient

01:13.531 --> 01:16.333
because you're at
the top of my list.

01:16.368 --> 01:17.601
I'm at the top of your list?

01:17.636 --> 01:19.303
I fucked Linda.

01:19.338 --> 01:22.006
Oh, okay, you fucked my sister.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.008
The... No.

01:24.043 --> 01:26.444
Your...?
Isn't your wife's name Linda?

01:26.478 --> 01:27.812
You fucked my wife?

01:27.847 --> 01:30.949
I did but I thought her name
was Linda. Isn't it Linda?

01:30.983 --> 01:32.150
It's Beth.

01:32.184 --> 01:34.085
Beth, right.

01:34.120 --> 01:36.354
Right, no, yeah,
Linda was your sister.

01:36.389 --> 01:37.956
She watched.
Watched?

01:37.990 --> 01:40.726
Yeah. It's crazy.

01:40.760 --> 01:44.698
But I'm sorry about that
and I hope we can make amends.

01:44.732 --> 01:47.200
This is cleaning soaps
full force

01:47.234 --> 01:49.103
because I feel like
I'm on a new drug.

01:49.137 --> 01:50.638
Just get the fuck out of here,
Pat.

01:50.672 --> 01:53.741
Well, as long as we're square,

01:53.775 --> 01:56.477
I feel like it's time to move on
down to number two on that list,

01:56.512 --> 01:58.513
you know what I mean?

02:01.451 --> 02:03.785
Looks like my next stop
is Mexico.

02:05.553 --> 02:06.987
Go fuck yourself, Pat.

02:07.021 --> 02:17.889
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:20.535 --> 02:23.736
Stevie, our time here in Mexico
has come to an end.

02:23.770 --> 02:26.872
We can't hide in this wasteland
forever chasing exotic women.

02:26.906 --> 02:29.308
It's time we get back
to the business of living.

02:29.342 --> 02:31.543
Face what awaits us
back in America.

02:31.577 --> 02:34.713
Okay, I'll make sure everything
is packed properly, Kenny.

02:34.747 --> 02:37.015
And, you know,

02:37.049 --> 02:39.417
if you wanna bang that
were-woman one more time

02:39.452 --> 02:41.119
for the memories,
I will allow it.

02:41.153 --> 02:42.720
Are you serious, Kenny?

02:42.755 --> 02:44.355
As a heart attack, hombre.

02:44.390 --> 02:47.058
Can I fuck her more
than once or just once?

02:47.092 --> 02:49.193
I mean, maybe don't lay
in her all goddamn day.

02:49.228 --> 02:50.561
You got some packing to do.

02:50.596 --> 02:52.931
Let's just think outside the box
for a sec, brainstorm.

02:52.965 --> 02:54.366
Like, let's make it memorable.

02:54.400 --> 02:55.968
If it's only one time,
let's do it up.

02:56.002 --> 02:58.003
Okay.
Maybe you go down on her, dude.

02:58.037 --> 03:00.939
Don't be selfish,
don't be sexist.

03:00.974 --> 03:02.574
You don't like that?

03:02.609 --> 03:04.043
Why not?

03:04.077 --> 03:05.210
It smells.

03:05.245 --> 03:06.845
Oh, I...
Yeah, I bet it does.

03:06.880 --> 03:09.881
She's always eating all that
weird stew and roots and shit.

03:09.916 --> 03:11.182
What about ATM?

03:12.751 --> 03:15.019
You don't know what's gonna
affect her immune system.

03:15.054 --> 03:17.622
They have different bacterias
and biological things here.

03:17.656 --> 03:18.923
Mm.
It's just for safety.

03:18.957 --> 03:20.725
Safety okay, okay.
Yeah.

03:20.759 --> 03:22.860
Don't sit there like
a dingleberry. Get to it.

03:22.894 --> 03:24.361
Okay.
Go get her, man.

03:24.396 --> 03:25.863
Okay.
Go.

03:27.799 --> 03:29.232
Ben Wa balls.

03:31.000 --> 03:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:53.120 --> 03:55.788
Guess who's sober.

03:55.823 --> 03:58.090
Pat Anderson, what in the fuck
are you doing here?

03:58.124 --> 04:00.392
I just wrapped up treatment,
accepted a higher power,

04:00.426 --> 04:03.761
and now I'm here to knock out
that ninth step and make amends.

04:03.795 --> 04:05.629
Why do people think
because we're in Mexico

04:05.663 --> 04:07.331
it's cool to come
into somebody's house

04:07.366 --> 04:08.766
and wait for 'em unannounced?

04:08.800 --> 04:12.035
I'm gonna cut to it, Kenny.
No bullshit, all truth.

04:12.070 --> 04:14.004
I butt-fucked you hard.

04:14.038 --> 04:16.406
But as a gentleman I've learned
to clean up my mess.

04:16.440 --> 04:20.175
Check out that sweet-ass
gift basket.

04:21.377 --> 04:23.478
What, you think
a mineral bath soak

04:23.513 --> 04:25.780
is gonna pay for all
the shit you did to me?

04:25.814 --> 04:27.181
There's an iPad in there, Kenny.

04:27.215 --> 04:28.616
Mm, really?

04:28.650 --> 04:29.917
It doesn't matter.

04:29.951 --> 04:32.019
It's gonna take more
than a goddamn Speak & Spell

04:32.053 --> 04:34.354
to win yourself into
the good grace of Kenny Powers.

04:34.388 --> 04:35.522
Oh, yeah?

04:35.556 --> 04:38.157
How about a shot at the majors?
Would that do the trick?

04:38.192 --> 04:40.125
Yeah, right.
Like I'm gonna fall

04:40.160 --> 04:43.028
for one of your mythical eight
figure contract deals again.

04:43.062 --> 04:45.597
There's no contract, not yet.
It's just a shot.

04:45.632 --> 04:47.999
But I heard about you playing
baseball down here, Kenny,

04:48.034 --> 04:50.268
and there's a scout in Texas
who owes me a favor

04:50.302 --> 04:52.770
from my circuit party days
and he agreed to come down here

04:52.805 --> 04:54.171
and sniff you out.

04:54.206 --> 04:55.472
Now I've been paying attention

04:55.506 --> 04:57.373
to what you've been
doing down here, Kenny,

04:57.408 --> 04:59.542
and if you play half as well
as you've been playing,

04:59.576 --> 05:01.510
I think you've got
a legitimate shot.

05:01.544 --> 05:03.444
Your friend's wasting his time.

05:03.445 --> 05:06.381
I don't play for the team
anymore. They cut me.

05:06.415 --> 05:10.184
Look, you got every reasond's
in the world not to trust me.

05:10.219 --> 05:12.486
But this could be
a game changer, Kenny.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.021
Is there anyone
you could talk to

05:14.055 --> 05:16.123
about getting back
on that team?

05:18.158 --> 05:19.859
Well, there is
one motherfucker.

05:29.035 --> 05:30.134
<i>Kumite.</i>

05:32.037 --> 05:33.738
What the fuck
are you doing here?

05:33.772 --> 05:36.039
Why is your voice raised
like a scared little bitch?

05:36.073 --> 05:38.674
No, I am not scared. If anybody
should be scared it's you, man.

05:38.709 --> 05:40.643
For stealing my car
and smashing up my studio,

05:40.677 --> 05:42.344
all because I fucked your lady.

05:42.378 --> 05:43.745
You think that's cool?
Mm-hm.

05:43.779 --> 05:45.579
Do you know what is cool?

05:45.614 --> 05:47.614
Paying people back.

05:47.649 --> 05:49.682
You wanna pull
that Bruce Lee shit with me

05:49.717 --> 05:52.218
I'll steal that sword from you
and fuck you with it.

05:52.252 --> 05:54.653
No, don't write checks
that can bounce.

05:56.556 --> 05:58.023
My spreadsheets!
Back up!

05:58.057 --> 06:01.726
I'll take this goddamn computers
and put it through your face

06:01.760 --> 06:03.628
<i>like a disk of fucking Tron.
Yeah, right.</i>

06:03.662 --> 06:05.363
I'll deflect it
and cut your arms off.

06:05.397 --> 06:07.598
Then I'll cut your face
before you know what's up.

06:07.632 --> 06:09.200
Well, look at this, huh?

06:09.234 --> 06:11.803
A goddamned Mexican standoff
in fucking Mexico.

06:11.838 --> 06:14.171
I was hoping to get into
one of these before I left.

06:14.205 --> 06:16.973
You are leaving, huh? You wanted
to come here first, huh,

06:17.007 --> 06:19.107
and try to kill me?
Not kill you.

06:19.141 --> 06:20.942
Kick your ass and then
ask you for a favor.

06:20.976 --> 06:23.879
Even though Vida's not the one
for me you steal behind my back

06:23.913 --> 06:25.480
and encouraged her
to cheat on me.

06:29.785 --> 06:31.986
Bro, I can't even get her
to call me back.

06:32.020 --> 06:35.189
Which sucks because I thought
we had something special.

06:35.223 --> 06:36.723
Yeah, well,

06:36.758 --> 06:38.525
I thought we had
something special too.

06:38.559 --> 06:40.860
Looks like that's her
fucking game, huh?

06:40.894 --> 06:42.828
I'm sorry, man.

06:42.863 --> 06:45.398
I haven't been acting
like myself.

06:47.333 --> 06:49.700
It's been really hard
to act normal.

06:49.735 --> 06:52.469
I've been acting
weird as shit, bro.

06:52.503 --> 06:55.337
I act like it's no big deal
that my parents are dead,

06:55.372 --> 06:57.372
but it is a big deal.
It hurts my heart, man.

06:57.407 --> 07:00.174
I cry all the time
in my bed by myself.

07:00.209 --> 07:02.043
I know what
you're talking about.

07:02.077 --> 07:04.611
I used to be just like you
yesterday.

07:04.646 --> 07:07.814
Sad inside and compensating

07:07.849 --> 07:09.649
by acting like
a fucking cocksucker.

07:09.684 --> 07:11.784
But I saw the light, dude.
I've changed.

07:11.819 --> 07:13.819
I want to see the light.
How did you do it?

07:13.854 --> 07:17.189
Well, I went on a personal quest
and faced my demons,

07:17.223 --> 07:20.191
but for you the change
could be a lot easier.

07:20.226 --> 07:22.793
Tell me.
Let me back on the team.

07:22.828 --> 07:24.561
For one more game.

07:24.596 --> 07:26.663
There's a scout coming

07:26.698 --> 07:29.632
and I intend to fuck
his world up with my skills.

07:29.667 --> 07:30.900
Hm.

07:30.934 --> 07:33.469
Or we could finish this duel

07:33.503 --> 07:35.004
and murder each other.

07:35.038 --> 07:38.506
No, I can live with
like a truce.

07:38.541 --> 07:42.343
If you want to play,
you can play.

07:43.845 --> 07:46.546
I'm sorry, man.
Come here.

07:50.184 --> 07:52.786
If I can fucking nail this
goddamn baseball shit tonight

07:52.820 --> 07:55.187
I'm going back to America
a goddamn champion.

07:55.222 --> 07:58.056
Fucking three days away from
sucking on some big old titties.

07:58.091 --> 08:02.894
♪ You so crazy
You fucking crazy ♪

08:02.928 --> 08:04.295
Are those my clothes?

08:04.329 --> 08:06.063
Uh, these are your
pants and shorts.

08:06.098 --> 08:08.699
Your tops we'd leave on hangers
so they don't get wrinkled.

08:08.733 --> 08:12.168
Dude, don't get all OCD about
this shit. Just get it done.

08:12.202 --> 08:14.570
Uh, Kenny, I was wondering...

08:14.605 --> 08:18.740
What is your policy
on last-minute passengers?

08:18.775 --> 08:21.109
What last-minute
passengers?

08:21.143 --> 08:22.777
Wah-wah.

08:22.811 --> 08:24.779
Wah-wah what?

08:24.813 --> 08:27.748
I know that technically I should
be asking Maria's father this,

08:27.782 --> 08:29.750
but in many ways I feel like

08:29.784 --> 08:31.885
you are the father
to all of the Mexicans here,

08:31.919 --> 08:33.753
plus you are
my spiritual leader,

08:33.787 --> 08:35.321
you are my friend, you are...

08:35.355 --> 08:37.556
Dude, just...
Jesus Christ, spill it. What?

08:37.591 --> 08:40.991
Okay.
I would like to ask you,

08:41.027 --> 08:42.794
Kenny Powers,

08:42.828 --> 08:44.395
permission to marry Maria

08:44.429 --> 08:46.463
and bring her back
to America with us.

08:46.497 --> 08:48.665
Marry her?
Yeah.

08:48.699 --> 08:51.734
Dude, I only told you
you could fuck her one time.

08:51.768 --> 08:54.470
Technically, you guys are not
even supposed to be dating.

08:54.504 --> 08:57.573
Yeah, I know. I know,

08:57.607 --> 08:59.341
but I can't help myself.

08:59.375 --> 09:01.509
It's like
all I think about is her

09:01.544 --> 09:03.945
and I don't know
what to do about it.

09:03.979 --> 09:06.880
Yeah, I know the feeling.

09:06.915 --> 09:10.049
Stevie, marriage is a pretty
big step, all right?

09:10.083 --> 09:11.917
I mean,
do you have any sort of plan

09:11.952 --> 09:13.952
of how you'll provide
for her financially?

09:13.987 --> 09:15.887
I have no plan whatsoever.

09:15.921 --> 09:18.156
And you do realize
that if you had offspring

09:18.190 --> 09:19.390
they would be mixed children?

09:19.425 --> 09:21.526
They could be made fun of
on the playground.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.027
I was made fun of
on the playground

09:23.061 --> 09:25.595
and I turned out pretty cool.

09:26.897 --> 09:28.764
Heh. You know what? Fuck it.

09:28.799 --> 09:31.433
Just as I have found
what I'm looking for here,

09:31.467 --> 09:34.002
maybe it's time you found what
you're looking for as well.

09:34.036 --> 09:38.206
Steven, if you would like
to take a Mexican wife...

09:38.240 --> 09:39.574
Yes, I would.

09:39.608 --> 09:41.909
If you think you can balance
her and your workload...

09:41.944 --> 09:43.010
I think I can.

09:43.044 --> 09:44.411
Without neglecting your duties.

09:44.446 --> 09:47.447
I will never neglect my duties.

09:47.481 --> 09:49.549
Then you have my permission.

09:51.351 --> 09:53.886
Thank you.

09:56.622 --> 10:00.724
Maria has something that
she would like to give you.

10:05.496 --> 10:07.430
How cool, a breadmaker.

10:07.464 --> 10:09.231
I was getting
pretty sick of eating

10:09.265 --> 10:12.267
all these fucking tortillas.
That's a good, good gift.

10:12.301 --> 10:14.903
No, that's just the box it's in.
It's homemade.

10:14.937 --> 10:17.372
Oh, cool, a homemade gift.

10:24.147 --> 10:26.281
I told her on the phone
to make a black one

10:26.316 --> 10:29.217
but she got confused.

10:31.720 --> 10:33.955
You like it?

10:39.794 --> 10:41.995

10:52.435 --> 10:54.735
Hey, Kenny.
You look different.

10:54.770 --> 10:56.003
Yeah, obviously.

10:56.038 --> 10:58.139
I' been reborn.
Oh.

10:58.173 --> 11:00.541
You're kind of bright. It's kind
of hard to look at you.

11:00.575 --> 11:02.142
Yeah, well,
people say Jesus Christ

11:02.176 --> 11:04.410
had the same effect on fools.

11:04.444 --> 11:06.278
These are the keys to the Denali.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.581
If you could find time
I'd like you to fix it.

11:09.615 --> 11:12.050
I had Stevie on the motherfucker
but he got derailed.

11:12.084 --> 11:13.551
Now it time for a professional.

11:13.586 --> 11:15.720
Time for Mexican.

11:15.755 --> 11:17.255
Where are you going
all dressed up?

11:17.289 --> 11:19.424
I'm going to settle some scores.

11:43.813 --> 11:45.547
Today I bring you freedom.

11:47.116 --> 11:49.683
Freedom, freedom.

12:00.927 --> 12:02.661
Freedom.

12:39.389 --> 12:40.756
Mexicans!

12:40.790 --> 12:43.091
<i>Oh, Mexicans!</i>

12:43.126 --> 12:45.126
For once in your life

12:45.161 --> 12:48.429
get off your coaches
and do something.

12:48.463 --> 12:52.733
This is your last chance
to see Kenny Powers.

12:52.767 --> 12:54.835
He lost the love of his life.

12:54.869 --> 12:58.137
He went to Mexico for a change.

12:58.172 --> 13:00.340
He met his father.

13:00.374 --> 13:03.041
He got screwed over in love.

13:03.076 --> 13:05.143
But the thing
about Kenny Powers

13:05.178 --> 13:09.881
is when he faces adversity
he moves past it.

13:09.915 --> 13:12.950
Because once Jesus
leaves the building

13:12.984 --> 13:15.953
he is out of Mexico for good.

13:22.960 --> 13:25.160
<i>Hola, you two.</i>

13:25.195 --> 13:26.895
Nobody get crazy
and pop off and go loco.

13:26.930 --> 13:28.530
I come in peace.

13:28.564 --> 13:30.165
Tone, what's up?

13:30.199 --> 13:32.533
I'm very sorry for what I
exposed you to last time we met.

13:32.568 --> 13:34.435
I hope you can
forgive me for that.

13:34.469 --> 13:36.236
What do you want, Kenny?

13:36.271 --> 13:38.839
Well, I thought
you two should know

13:38.873 --> 13:42.308
that I'm moseying on back
to the old U.S. of A.

13:42.342 --> 13:44.877
Looks like this gunslinger's
work is done here.

13:44.911 --> 13:46.178
You're a gunslinger?

13:46.212 --> 13:47.979
The short answer to that,
Tony, is yes.

13:48.014 --> 13:49.214
Yes, I am.

13:49.248 --> 13:50.515
You kill people?

13:50.549 --> 13:53.751
And the short answer
to that is also yes.

13:55.186 --> 13:56.353
Okay.

13:56.387 --> 13:57.888
Listen to your mom, Tone.

14:00.425 --> 14:02.059
That's a good kid.

14:02.093 --> 14:04.094
How could you bring Tony
to Sebastian's?

14:05.730 --> 14:07.964
Well, I didn't know I was
leading him to front row seats

14:07.998 --> 14:09.866
to watch his momma
commit oral adultery.

14:09.900 --> 14:12.102
I thought I was just bringing
him there to show him

14:12.136 --> 14:13.870
how self-centered
you were being.

14:13.905 --> 14:16.105
What?
None of this matters, all right?

14:16.139 --> 14:17.539
Did you hurt my feelings?

14:17.573 --> 14:19.606
Yes, you did.
I will give you that victory.

14:19.641 --> 14:22.207
But the one victory you will not
have is the most important.

14:22.242 --> 14:25.976
I'll admit, that sweet tailpipe
of yours did have me charmed.

14:26.010 --> 14:27.610
It put a spell on me.

14:27.645 --> 14:29.412
But all the ass-magic
in Mexico

14:29.447 --> 14:32.080
can't change Kenny Powers
from his core beliefs.

14:32.114 --> 14:36.050
I'm not an ass man.
I'm a tit man.

14:36.084 --> 14:37.985
I like big-ass boobs.

14:38.019 --> 14:40.119
Now and forever.

14:40.154 --> 14:42.254
I'm not like a black guy, Vida.

14:42.289 --> 14:44.290
Congratulations.

14:44.325 --> 14:46.360
Don't go getting your
feelings hurt, all right?

14:46.394 --> 14:48.896
You and I both knew this
was never gonna last forever.

14:48.930 --> 14:52.034
You're like the girl the
Godfather fucked back in Italy.

14:52.068 --> 14:54.102
You know, what we had
was important

14:54.136 --> 14:57.538
but the real deal is
waiting for me back at home.

15:00.808 --> 15:03.377
I gotta go.

15:07.315 --> 15:09.149
Adios, Kenny Powers.

15:10.851 --> 15:13.485
Adios, bubble butt.

15:32.103 --> 15:37.374

15:57.891 --> 15:59.624
Shit.

15:59.658 --> 16:03.425
Charros, I come to you
tonight with no theatrics.

16:03.460 --> 16:06.159
Goddamn it, Kenny, I thought you
were through with the Charros.

16:06.193 --> 16:07.860
Yeah, I thought I was too.

16:07.894 --> 16:11.060
But now I have returned
for one more fucking game.

16:11.094 --> 16:15.097
I have Sebastian's blessing
and I was hoping to get yours.

16:15.132 --> 16:18.367
But why? I don't even know what
baseball means to you anymore.

16:18.401 --> 16:20.037
I deserve that.

16:20.071 --> 16:21.873
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't here

16:21.907 --> 16:23.707
primarily to play for the scout

16:23.742 --> 16:25.409
that is rumored
to be here tonight.

16:25.443 --> 16:28.912
But there's also
a very small pt of me...

16:28.946 --> 16:30.580
Yet significant part.

16:30.615 --> 16:32.215
 that would always regret

16:32.249 --> 16:34.383
how I left things
here with the team.

16:36.820 --> 16:39.555
<i>Ese brillante, no. Okay?</i>

16:39.589 --> 16:42.624
Team, Roger,

16:42.658 --> 16:45.593
Benji, bat boy...

16:45.627 --> 16:48.696
I genuinely am sorry.

16:48.730 --> 16:51.732
I brought you guys up from
less than fucking nothing

16:51.766 --> 16:53.633
and took you up
to a championship level

16:53.668 --> 16:56.135
only to abandon you there.

16:56.169 --> 16:58.337
Leave you high and dry.

16:58.371 --> 17:00.372
Naked and nude,

17:00.406 --> 17:02.974
prey, easy targets

17:03.008 --> 17:06.477
for the competitions
to rape and butt-fuck you.

17:06.511 --> 17:08.345
I'm sorry for that.

17:08.378 --> 17:10.280
Actually, we've been playing
pretty good.

17:10.314 --> 17:12.382
We've won the last
three games, right?

17:12.415 --> 17:14.316
Well, don't get too cocky,
Roger.

17:14.351 --> 17:16.417
That's probably because
there's still a little

17:16.452 --> 17:17.952
residual Kenny Powers
pixie dust

17:17.986 --> 17:19.686
floating around
all your little heads.

17:19.722 --> 17:22.256
Let's face it, guys.
After midnight

17:22.290 --> 17:24.625
this whole fucking place
turns into a pumpkin

17:24.659 --> 17:27.292
and you guys
all turn back into mice.

17:27.328 --> 17:29.329
This is a classic
Cinderella tale here.

17:29.363 --> 17:32.665
You know, Peter Pan
will no longer be a man,

17:32.699 --> 17:34.566
he'll turn into real boy.

17:34.601 --> 17:38.103
George Washington will never be
able to cut down the beanstalk.

17:38.137 --> 17:41.039
You guys will eventually
just go back

17:41.073 --> 17:45.776
to being the shittiest Mexican
baseball team in Mexico.

17:45.810 --> 17:48.045
These are the hard
realities, guys.

17:48.079 --> 17:49.446
Life is not a fairytale.

17:49.480 --> 17:52.715
Although sometimes it feels like
our world is full of fairies.

17:52.750 --> 17:54.550
You know who I'm talking about.

17:54.584 --> 17:56.652
I still accept you, brother.

17:56.686 --> 18:00.321
Purity,
that's what we all desire.

18:00.355 --> 18:02.222
And that is what I've come here

18:02.256 --> 18:04.157
to share with you,
hence the all whites.

18:04.191 --> 18:07.493
We can do some fucking great
things tonight, you guys.

18:07.527 --> 18:09.627
Follow me,

18:09.662 --> 18:11.829
walk with me
out onto that field

18:11.863 --> 18:13.897
and when you do,
you fucking put ur ass out

18:13.932 --> 18:15.966
and you raise
your fucking head up.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.769
Know that you'll never ever,
ever reach the heights

18:18.803 --> 18:22.773
that you're gonna reach tonight.
But you can leave here knowing

18:22.807 --> 18:26.009
that you helped
Kenny Powers' dreams come true.

18:26.044 --> 18:28.712
And for a bunch of Mexican
baseball players,

18:28.746 --> 18:31.848
that ain't too bad.

18:31.883 --> 18:34.651
If you're gonna play tonight,

18:34.685 --> 18:37.754
you're gonna play
like everybody else.

18:37.788 --> 18:41.490
No donkey, no smoke bombs,
no dick thrusts.

18:41.525 --> 18:43.859
Just pure pitching.

18:43.893 --> 18:46.228
I can fucking dig that.

18:49.898 --> 18:52.165
We're all Mexicans tonight,
Kenny.

18:52.200 --> 18:53.633
You're goddamned right we are.

18:53.668 --> 18:55.668
Can we bring it in?
Can we fucking bring it in?

18:55.703 --> 18:56.769
Come on, come on in.

18:56.804 --> 18:59.271
- A Mexican fucking chant.
- Come on!

18:59.306 --> 19:02.273
Let's kick some ass!
We're Mexican!

19:02.308 --> 19:04.942
Mexico, Mexico, Mexico!

19:09.447 --> 19:11.447
I'm a fucking Mexican tonight!

19:11.482 --> 19:14.951
I'm a fucking Mexican!
I'm a fucking Mexican!

19:14.985 --> 19:17.286
All right, I'm gonna
go change my clothes.

19:17.320 --> 19:18.854

21:35.139 --> 21:36.673
Take it easy, Carlos.

21:38.975 --> 21:41.710
See you, Juanito.
Take care of them warts.

21:45.948 --> 21:48.482
You threw a hell of a game,
Kenny.

21:48.516 --> 21:50.951
Game ball.

21:50.985 --> 21:52.719
Thanks, Roger.

21:52.753 --> 21:55.788
I'll put this with my collection
of personal achievements.

21:55.822 --> 21:59.725
I mean, not right next
to the good shit but still.

22:06.998 --> 22:09.066
Kenny Powers! Sweet-ass game,
motherfucker.

22:09.100 --> 22:11.001
I'm so proud of you, man.

22:11.035 --> 22:13.203
All right. Too hot
for hugs here, man.

22:13.237 --> 22:14.971
I've been battling
the war on swamp ass

22:15.005 --> 22:16.305
since I've been down here.

22:16.340 --> 22:18.807
A little talcum powder
on the groin will keep it fresh.

22:18.842 --> 22:20.575
Talcum?
Yes, sir.

22:20.610 --> 22:22.744
Roy McDaniel, scout from Texas.

22:22.778 --> 22:24.645
Like what I saw
out there tonight.

22:24.680 --> 22:26.013
You weren't bullshitting, huh?

22:26.048 --> 22:28.015
I was not.
This is the scout from Texas.

22:28.049 --> 22:29.816
P.A.T. told me
you were throwing grenades

22:29.851 --> 22:32.352
down here south of the border.
I got in my Escalade.

22:34.988 --> 22:37.823
To Mexico? Oh.
That's when you came here.

22:37.858 --> 22:39.091
To see you.
To see me.

22:39.125 --> 22:40.659
Yes, sir.

22:40.693 --> 22:43.161
What do you think?
Does Texas want a fucking taste?

22:43.195 --> 22:45.630
Well, they want to nibble,
all right?

22:45.664 --> 22:47.898
There is a difference between
mowing down Mexicans

22:47.933 --> 22:49.366
down here south of the border

22:49.400 --> 22:51.868
than mowing down the big boys
up in, uh, major leagues.

22:51.902 --> 22:54.103
Yeah, they don't speak
the same language.

22:54.138 --> 22:57.006
It a different level
of player but, uh...

22:57.040 --> 22:58.974
But still, it's still
very difficult.

22:59.009 --> 23:01.310
It's very hotter down here.
You look good out there.

23:01.344 --> 23:03.612
Oh, I don't think you're ready
for the bigs just yet.

23:03.646 --> 23:06.214
I don't, but...
Pat, you motherfucker.

23:06.248 --> 23:08.349
All right, hey, hey, hey.
Wasting my time again?

23:08.383 --> 23:09.583
Don't motherfuck Pat.

23:09.618 --> 23:11.284
Pat's been on your side
the whole time.

23:11.319 --> 23:13.653
You don't know the history.
Pat has fucked me before.

23:13.687 --> 23:15.854
No, just listen to the man,
listen to the man.

23:15.889 --> 23:18.356
I was ready to go home get
the goddamn girl of my dreams.

23:18.390 --> 23:20.791
Came here wasting time...
Kenny Powers.

23:20.825 --> 23:22.626
Pat got you in the door,
he got me down here.

23:22.660 --> 23:24.862
I came with good news.

23:24.897 --> 23:26.163
Myrtle Beach.

23:26.198 --> 23:27.932
You come out there,
you show me the stuff

23:27.966 --> 23:29.233
you got on the mound tonight

23:29.267 --> 23:30.700
in training camp
in Myrtle Beach,

23:30.735 --> 23:32.669
I don't see why you cat play
for our double A.

23:32.703 --> 23:34.604
Double A, huh?
Double A.

23:34.638 --> 23:35.971
So we're talking minors?

23:36.006 --> 23:37.840
We're talking training camp,
then minors.

23:37.874 --> 23:40.008
We're talking come
to the team, throw one game,

23:40.043 --> 23:42.244
show everyone what I'm
working with into the bigs.

23:42.278 --> 23:44.545
Probably more than
one game, to be fair.

23:44.580 --> 23:46.647
Maybe two games,
smoke 'em into the bigs.

23:46.681 --> 23:48.448
Maybe more than two.

23:48.483 --> 23:50.150
What I'm saying is
you'll be on your way.

23:50.184 --> 23:54.787
I'm talking about getting you
back into American baseball.

23:54.821 --> 23:56.956
All right, well,
that does sound enticing.

23:56.990 --> 23:58.090
You gotta trust me.

23:58.124 --> 24:00.058
I'm not down here
to tickle fucking balls.

24:00.092 --> 24:01.793
I hope not.

24:01.827 --> 24:03.861
I chased my dream, I got it.

24:03.896 --> 24:07.598
I sucked my dream's cock.

24:07.632 --> 24:10.400
I'm gay,
I'm fucking proud of it.

24:10.434 --> 24:12.735
No, that's cool.
You know, pride is great.

24:12.769 --> 24:14.936
Whatever raises your skirt.

24:14.971 --> 24:16.471
And if you wanna wear a skirt

24:16.505 --> 24:18.206
I'm not gonna
fucking judge you for it.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.007
You wanna
get back in big leagues?

24:20.042 --> 24:21.075
I'm ready.
Follow me.

24:21.109 --> 24:23.411
I like how we talk.
Fucking lick it.

24:24.546 --> 24:26.547
Spring training, Myrtle Beach.

24:26.581 --> 24:28.815
Kenny Powers, it is time
to quit tickling balls

24:28.850 --> 24:30.783
and start
sucking your dream's dick.

24:30.818 --> 24:31.917
If that's what it takes

24:31.952 --> 24:34.686
then a cocking dream
it will be sucked upon.

24:34.721 --> 24:36.588
Swallow that motherfucker.
Swallow it.

24:36.622 --> 24:38.256
Suck it, suck the dick.

24:38.290 --> 24:40.124
Big ass.
Let's suck my dream's dick.

24:40.158 --> 24:41.325
Fight on it, big boy!

24:41.360 --> 24:42.693
I like this guy.

24:42.727 --> 24:44.228
Are we gonna party
in Myrtle Beach?

24:44.262 --> 24:46.129
Suck a dream's dick.
Let's party tonight.

24:46.163 --> 24:47.397
I wish I could.

24:47.431 --> 24:49.398
I got some Mexican cake
back at my hotel room.

24:49.433 --> 24:51.967
Let's fucking smear it
all over each other.

24:52.001 --> 24:54.703
We're fucking celebrating, man.
Let's do this.

24:54.737 --> 24:55.904
I got a mission to complete.

24:55.938 --> 24:57.905
See your ass in Myrtle Beach.
Myrtle.

24:57.940 --> 25:01.441
Kenny Powers.
Myrtle, K.P.

25:10.650 --> 25:15.821
<i>Chapter 17: done
and fucking done.</i>

25:15.855 --> 25:17.923
<i>Just like that
the journey is over.</i>

25:17.957 --> 25:20.258
<i>Depression is finished
and you're on your way back</i>

25:20.292 --> 25:23.762
<i>to the world of the living,
smiling regular people.</i>

25:25.364 --> 25:27.765
<i>The road has been paved with
dickheads, backstabbers</i>

25:27.800 --> 25:29.634
<i>and pains in the fucking ass.</i>

25:29.668 --> 25:32.737
<i>But memories were made,
allies were had,</i>

25:32.771 --> 25:34.972
<i>pot smokers were toppled</i>

25:35.006 --> 25:37.641
<i>and the truth was discovered.</i>

25:37.675 --> 25:40.043
<i>And like any journey, if you
stay the course long enough</i>

25:40.077 --> 25:42.645
<i>the road might just
show you what you need.</i>

25:42.680 --> 25:45.782
<i>All you gotta do is
keep your eyes on the road</i>

25:45.816 --> 25:48.284
<i>and your foot
on the fucking gas.</i>

25:49.753 --> 25:51.287
Do you like it?

25:51.321 --> 25:53.756
Yeah, I mean did I like it
how it was before,

25:53.790 --> 25:55.224
regular style? Yes.

25:55.258 --> 25:57.425
But I'm sure I'll get
to like this style too, man.

25:57.459 --> 25:59.159
Ah. Change is good,
my friend.

25:59.193 --> 26:02.328
That it is. You're a
good neighbor, hombre.

26:02.362 --> 26:04.630
You take that with you
to the grave.

26:04.664 --> 26:06.798
Look at these
two little bandidos.

26:06.833 --> 26:09.534
I know that we didn't always
agree on the same kind of music

26:09.568 --> 26:11.602
or leisure sports
but I am gonna miss y'all.

26:11.636 --> 26:13.604
Slap it there.
There we go.

26:13.638 --> 26:15.873
Put it there buddy.
Put a shirt on, man.

26:15.907 --> 26:18.008
Heh. I got something for you.

26:18.042 --> 26:19.375
Boom.

26:19.410 --> 26:20.843
He's yours.

26:20.878 --> 26:23.245
Whenever I look at a Mexican
I will think of you.

26:23.280 --> 26:26.047
Whenever you look at that
jackass you think of me.

26:26.081 --> 26:28.182
Okay?

26:28.217 --> 26:31.185
Miss you, buddy.
They'll take care of you.

26:31.219 --> 26:33.220
Come on, he's yours.

26:33.254 --> 26:34.854
Here, come on, get on him.

26:34.889 --> 26:37.123
Just be careful about
the back legs.

26:37.157 --> 26:39.658
He will kick you
in the face. I'm serious.

26:39.693 --> 26:41.827
All right, guys, come on,
time to make tracks.

26:41.861 --> 26:44.429
- Time to go.
- Catuey's wife,

26:44.464 --> 26:47.966
grandma lady, I know that we
always didn't communicate.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.868
I don't think we ever really
got over that language barrier.

26:50.902 --> 26:53.502
No, it's not your fault.

26:53.537 --> 26:55.204
What the fuck?
You speak English?

26:55.238 --> 26:56.805
Of course I do.

26:56.840 --> 26:58.674
You've spoke English
the whole time?

26:58.708 --> 27:00.442
I speak English
since I was 5 years old.

27:00.476 --> 27:03.277
- Five?
- And I have 84 now.

27:03.312 --> 27:04.812
Whoo, you don't look
a day over 110.

27:04.846 --> 27:06.547
All the talks we could've had,

27:06.581 --> 27:08.115
all the wisdom
you could've shared.

27:08.149 --> 27:09.817
Pfft! Crazy I find
this out right now

27:09.851 --> 27:11.918
as soon as I'm leaving
this fucking country.

27:11.953 --> 27:13.320
Well, it's nice to meet you.

27:13.354 --> 27:15.688
Nice to meet you too.
Thank you.

27:15.723 --> 27:18.157
Stevie, Maria, let's dance
our way on out of here, huh?

27:19.593 --> 27:21.493
- Gotta go.
- Let's do it.

27:21.528 --> 27:23.528
- Adios, you guys.
- Adios.

27:23.563 --> 27:25.897
I love you too.

27:25.932 --> 27:27.132
I love you too.

27:28.434 --> 27:29.701
Bye, Catuey.

27:31.536 --> 27:34.470
Adios, Mexico.
