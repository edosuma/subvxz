00:42.959 --> 00:45.876
we have got your MVP of

00:42.959 --> 00:45.876
Saturday night's game.

00:45.918 --> 00:49.125
Everyone please help me

00:45.918 --> 00:49.125
welcome your star quarterback,

00:49.167 --> 00:51.000
[Jake And Naomi] Cole Smith!

00:51.042 --> 00:52.751
[Jake] Come on up here,

00:51.042 --> 00:52.751
Cole, all right.

00:52.792 --> 00:54.209
[audience cheering]

00:54.250 --> 00:56.459
- Get on up here.

00:54.250 --> 00:56.459
- [Man] Cole!

00:56.500 --> 00:58.334
- Hi, Cole, thank

00:56.500 --> 00:58.334
you for joining us.

00:58.375 --> 00:59.417
I'm sure everyone wants to know

00:59.459 --> 01:02.000
what we can expect

00:59.459 --> 01:02.000
for the next game.

01:02.042 --> 01:04.167
- Well, Naomi, I'd

01:02.042 --> 01:04.167
kind of like to know

01:04.209 --> 01:06.417
what you think our

01:04.209 --> 01:06.417
strategy should be?

01:06.459 --> 01:09.500
- [Naomi] Well, I think

01:06.459 --> 01:09.500
if they just focus

01:09.542 --> 01:11.417
on that rocket

01:09.542 --> 01:11.417
right arm of yours--

01:11.459 --> 01:12.918
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:12.959 --> 01:14.209
Ugh, technical difficulty.

01:14.250 --> 01:16.417
- What?

01:14.250 --> 01:16.417
- Until next time!

01:16.459 --> 01:19.083
- [Crowd] Soar, Eagles, soar!

01:19.125 --> 01:20.000
Alright, thanks Cole.

01:19.125 --> 01:20.000
- I'm sorry.

01:20.042 --> 01:23.209
- Nah, that's okay, thank you.

01:25.375 --> 01:28.167
- Well, another great

01:25.375 --> 01:28.167
show for the dynamic duo

01:28.209 --> 01:29.417
minus, you know, the

01:28.209 --> 01:29.417
technical stuff there.

01:29.459 --> 01:32.751
- [Jake] Yeah, listen, Naomi...

01:32.792 --> 01:34.918
I was hoping maybe

01:32.792 --> 01:34.918
tonight we could...

01:39.834 --> 01:41.751
- Come on, let's grab a beer.

01:43.042 --> 01:43.876
- Okay.

01:53.042 --> 01:56.542
- It's been what, two weeks

01:53.042 --> 01:56.542
since we broke up and you've

01:53.042 --> 01:56.542
already moved on?

01:56.584 --> 02:00.667
- Lana, can we talk about this

01:56.584 --> 02:00.667
outside--

01:56.584 --> 02:00.667
- No, never touch me again!

01:56.584 --> 02:00.667
Ever!

02:20.459 --> 02:23.459
[Cole, gasping]

02:44.042 --> 02:46.876
- Alright, and we are back.

02:46.918 --> 02:48.417
So before the break,

02:48.459 --> 02:51.334
Olivia, you were saying that

02:48.459 --> 02:51.334
this new soft baby carrier

02:51.375 --> 02:53.375
is perfect for the

02:51.375 --> 02:53.375
working mom on the go.

02:53.417 --> 02:54.584
- Yes, that's right Naomi.

02:54.626 --> 02:56.459
As you can see it's very durable

02:56.500 --> 02:58.375
and adjustable making it perfect

02:58.417 --> 02:59.626
for the mom on the go.

02:59.667 --> 03:00.959
So you can get all

02:59.667 --> 03:00.959
your errands done

03:01.000 --> 03:02.334
and not neglect your baby.

03:03.167 --> 03:04.626
- Huh, I love it.

03:04.667 --> 03:06.459
- I don't know, Naomi, that

03:04.667 --> 03:06.459
looks pretty good on you.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.709
Maybe it's time for you and

03:06.500 --> 03:08.709
that perfect husband of yours,

03:08.751 --> 03:12.417
Trent, to have a little

03:08.751 --> 03:12.417
baby of your own, huh?

03:12.459 --> 03:15.751
[soft chuckling]

03:12.459 --> 03:15.751
- Okay, okay.

03:15.792 --> 03:17.792
Yeah, well, right now my

03:15.792 --> 03:17.792
mornings are a little full

03:17.834 --> 03:19.375
with you already Robert.

03:19.417 --> 03:22.250
So let's just leave

03:19.417 --> 03:22.250
it there for now.

03:22.292 --> 03:23.876
[Robert chuckling]

03:22.292 --> 03:23.876
Okay.

03:23.918 --> 03:26.083
Alright, you guys that's

03:23.918 --> 03:26.083
our show for today.

03:26.125 --> 03:26.918
See you guys tomorrow.

03:26.959 --> 03:29.334
Morning Naomi

03:30.083 --> 03:30.959
[audience applauding]

03:36.417 --> 03:38.417
- I thought you did great.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.417
- Good show guys, good show.

03:38.459 --> 03:40.751
Not great, but good.

03:40.792 --> 03:43.083
Yeah, I just got off a

03:40.792 --> 03:43.083
call from the network,

03:43.125 --> 03:47.167
and TW Studios, our

03:43.125 --> 03:47.167
biggest competition, has

03:47.209 --> 03:50.959
once again, surpassed us in

03:47.209 --> 03:50.959
our new targeted demographic.

03:52.626 --> 03:55.584
As you know it is

03:52.626 --> 03:55.584
a copycat industry,

03:55.626 --> 03:59.500
so I am coming to the

03:55.626 --> 03:59.500
two of you for any ideas

03:59.542 --> 04:03.876
on how to bring us to

03:59.542 --> 04:03.876
fresh eyes, new households?

04:04.792 --> 04:05.918
- We'll give it some thought.

04:05.959 --> 04:08.083
- Great, we'll

04:05.959 --> 04:08.083
circle back to that.

04:08.125 --> 04:09.000
- Cool.

04:08.125 --> 04:09.000
- Guess we're not

04:09.042 --> 04:10.500
trending like we used to be.

04:10.542 --> 04:13.125
- Yeah, I guess, we just gotta

04:10.542 --> 04:13.125
be a little more current.

04:13.167 --> 04:15.584
Like I would currently

04:13.167 --> 04:15.584
kill for a cup of coffee,

04:15.626 --> 04:19.125
but I'm off to my

04:15.626 --> 04:19.125
cardiologist, so thank you.

04:20.166 --> 04:21.000
- [Naomi] Bye.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.667
- Well, now that

04:24.500 --> 04:26.667
I've done my duty

04:26.709 --> 04:28.375
as the mean boss for the day,

04:28.417 --> 04:30.375
how about lunch

04:28.417 --> 04:30.375
with your bestie?

04:30.417 --> 04:32.876
- I can't actually Trent

04:30.417 --> 04:32.876
is stopping by the studio.

04:32.918 --> 04:34.834
He's downtown for

04:32.918 --> 04:34.834
his big presentation.

04:34.876 --> 04:37.292
Today is the day.

04:34.876 --> 04:37.292
- Oh, that's right.

04:37.334 --> 04:39.792
Well, in this case

04:37.334 --> 04:39.792
congratulations in advance

04:39.834 --> 04:41.959
because I know he

04:39.834 --> 04:41.959
got the project.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.334
- Thanks, I'll call you after.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.334
- Yes, okay.

04:43.375 --> 04:44.209
- Okay.

04:46.334 --> 04:47.459
Bye, guys.

04:46.334 --> 04:47.459
- Alright.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.209
- [Audience] Bye.

04:49.250 --> 04:51.959
- [Man] Love you Naomi.

04:49.250 --> 04:51.959
- Is that one I picked out?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.709
- Yes, it is.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.709
- Ah, I thought so.

04:54.751 --> 04:57.292
I could really get used

04:54.751 --> 04:57.292
to my husband coming to

04:57.334 --> 04:59.334
visit me at work in

04:57.334 --> 04:59.334
the middle of the day.

04:59.375 --> 05:01.375
- Really, well, how

04:59.375 --> 05:01.375
about the next year?

05:02.751 --> 05:04.167
- You got the job.

05:02.751 --> 05:04.167
- Hmm-mm.

05:04.209 --> 05:06.375
You're now looking at the

05:04.209 --> 05:06.375
lead architect of what

05:06.417 --> 05:09.167
the mayor has called the

05:06.417 --> 05:09.167
city's defining development.

05:09.209 --> 05:13.334
- Babe, oh, that is amazing.

05:13.375 --> 05:16.000
I guess, all those months

05:13.375 --> 05:16.000
practicing your presentation

05:16.042 --> 05:17.751
fresh out of the shower

05:16.042 --> 05:17.751
nothing but a towel

05:17.792 --> 05:19.417
actually paid off.

05:17.792 --> 05:19.417
- I guess they have.

05:19.459 --> 05:22.167
I'm just glad I

05:19.459 --> 05:22.167
remembered to wear a suit.

05:22.209 --> 05:23.876
- Well, it's probably

05:22.209 --> 05:23.876
best you did.

05:23.918 --> 05:25.542
But I'm gonna miss

05:23.918 --> 05:25.542
our practice sessions.

05:25.584 --> 05:26.584
- Oh, so am I.

05:28.292 --> 05:29.250
- That's amazing, babe.

05:29.292 --> 05:30.709
You worked so hard.

05:30.751 --> 05:32.709
- We worked hard

05:30.751 --> 05:32.709
we're a team remember?

05:33.542 --> 05:34.751
- Yes.

05:34.792 --> 05:36.751
- Speaking of working

05:34.792 --> 05:36.751
hard, how's the show?

05:36.792 --> 05:39.083
- Good, we had Olivia

05:36.792 --> 05:39.083
on again today.

05:39.125 --> 05:40.834
- Okay, and?

05:40.876 --> 05:42.876
- And there are a

05:40.876 --> 05:42.876
lot of great products

05:42.918 --> 05:44.125
out there for the

05:42.918 --> 05:44.125
working parent.

05:44.167 --> 05:46.042
- And the non-working parent?

05:46.083 --> 05:47.626
- What do you mean?

05:47.667 --> 05:50.042
- Well, with this job I'm

05:47.667 --> 05:50.042
gonna be making a lot of money

05:50.083 --> 05:51.709
and enough to

05:50.083 --> 05:51.709
support both of us,

05:51.751 --> 05:53.876
so if you were

05:51.751 --> 05:53.876
considering taking off

05:53.918 --> 05:55.751
the next couple of

05:53.918 --> 05:55.751
years to focus on,

05:56.667 --> 05:59.083
you know, building our family,

05:59.125 --> 06:00.500
now might be the right time.

06:01.959 --> 06:04.542
- Well, we did always say we

06:01.959 --> 06:04.542
knew that time would come.

06:04.584 --> 06:06.042
- Hmm-mm.

06:06.083 --> 06:08.250
- But I just can't picture

06:06.083 --> 06:08.250
my life without the show.

06:09.167 --> 06:10.876
- Well, maybe you don't have to.

06:10.918 --> 06:13.250
It is geared towards

06:10.918 --> 06:13.250
working moms, right?

06:13.292 --> 06:16.125
- Yeah, I mean, maybe I would

06:13.292 --> 06:16.125
connect more with my audience

06:16.167 --> 06:18.083
if I was an actual working mom.

06:19.459 --> 06:21.292
- Well, think about it

06:19.459 --> 06:21.292
just know that I am here,

06:21.334 --> 06:24.083
and I'm gonna support

06:21.334 --> 06:24.083
anything for our team.

06:27.626 --> 06:29.167
Okay.

06:29.209 --> 06:30.417
- I mean, our

06:29.209 --> 06:30.417
announcement would be

06:30.459 --> 06:32.334
quite the on-air announcement.

06:32.375 --> 06:33.667
- Hmm-mm.

06:33.709 --> 06:35.792
- And it would help us

06:33.709 --> 06:35.792
in the targeted demos.

06:37.209 --> 06:38.751
You know what I'm gonna

06:37.209 --> 06:38.751
figure all that out later.

06:38.792 --> 06:40.918
Right now it is all

06:38.792 --> 06:40.918
about my handsome,

06:40.959 --> 06:43.292
very successful husband.

06:40.959 --> 06:43.292
[Trent chuckling]

06:43.334 --> 06:44.626
Let's go celebrate.

06:44.667 --> 06:46.334
- Let's go, come on.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.375
- Hi, there.

07:12.417 --> 07:14.542
I was hoping to make an

07:12.417 --> 07:14.542
appointment with Mrs. Spinner.

07:14.584 --> 07:17.209
- Oh, you'll have to see

07:14.584 --> 07:17.209
the show secretary for that.

07:17.250 --> 07:19.292
I just open and close the gate.

07:19.334 --> 07:20.167
- Right.

07:21.918 --> 07:22.876
How's that coffee?

07:22.918 --> 07:24.459
- Best in the city.

07:24.500 --> 07:25.834
It's right down the street.

07:25.876 --> 07:27.834
Naomi brings me one every day.

07:27.876 --> 07:30.667
- Oh, I'll have to

07:27.876 --> 07:30.667
try it sometime.

07:30.709 --> 07:32.209
You have a good day.

07:57.083 --> 07:58.667
- Before you go

07:57.083 --> 07:58.667
calling some hot-shot

07:58.709 --> 08:01.500
attorney to challenge

07:58.709 --> 08:01.500
this decision,

08:01.542 --> 08:03.542
here's a generous

08:01.542 --> 08:03.542
severance check

08:03.584 --> 08:05.334
to keep your head above water.

08:05.375 --> 08:07.834
Please, have your

08:05.375 --> 08:07.834
dressing room cleared out

08:07.876 --> 08:09.459
by the end of the day.

08:12.584 --> 08:15.250
[heavy sighing]

08:35.417 --> 08:37.167
- Hi, two regulars, please.

08:40.082 --> 08:41.082
Just keep the change.

08:43.333 --> 08:44.167
Thank you.

08:46.918 --> 08:48.083
- Naomi Brown.

08:49.334 --> 08:50.292
- Jake Everett.

08:50.334 --> 08:51.709
- Wow.

08:51.751 --> 08:53.459
Wow, what are the odds?

08:53.500 --> 08:55.792
- I mean, what it's been

08:53.500 --> 08:55.792
like 10 years or something.

08:55.834 --> 08:58.459
- Yeah, and it's Naomi

08:55.834 --> 08:58.459
Spinner now, right?

08:58.500 --> 09:00.459
- That is right.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.459
- Oh, congratulations.

09:00.500 --> 09:01.709
- Thank you.

09:01.751 --> 09:02.959
- I guess, it's kind of

09:01.751 --> 09:02.959
impossible not to hear

09:03.000 --> 09:04.209
about what's going on

09:03.000 --> 09:04.209
with people these days.

09:04.250 --> 09:06.125
- Yeah, the last I heard

09:04.250 --> 09:06.125
you were in Florida.

09:06.167 --> 09:08.542
- I was, but now I'm here.

09:08.584 --> 09:11.292
I've actually caught your

09:08.584 --> 09:11.292
show every day I've been here,

09:11.334 --> 09:13.584
which is twice now.

09:11.334 --> 09:13.584
- Okay.

09:13.626 --> 09:15.167
- You've come along

09:13.626 --> 09:15.167
way from Campus Cool.

09:15.209 --> 09:18.083
- Oh, yeah, wow, those

09:15.209 --> 09:18.083
were some fun times.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.584
- [Jake] Yeah, you

09:18.125 --> 09:19.584
still remember?

09:19.626 --> 09:21.000
- Of course, you

09:19.626 --> 09:21.000
were the first one

09:21.042 --> 09:22.751
to ever get me up on the stage.

09:22.792 --> 09:24.042
Taught me everything I know.

09:24.083 --> 09:26.834
- Oh, nah, you were a

09:24.083 --> 09:26.834
natural and so pretty.

09:26.876 --> 09:29.500
- Awe, are you still hosting?

09:29.542 --> 09:31.751
- I am, yeah, I had a

09:29.542 --> 09:31.751
great job down in Florida,

09:31.792 --> 09:34.209
but I felt creatively stifled.

09:35.334 --> 09:36.500
I need something

09:35.334 --> 09:36.500
fresh, so I came here.

09:36.542 --> 09:38.167
I'm actually looking to set up

09:38.209 --> 09:39.918
hosting job

09:38.209 --> 09:39.918
interviews in the area

09:39.959 --> 09:43.083
if you know anybody

09:39.959 --> 09:43.083
who's looking?

09:43.125 --> 09:45.250
- Oh, well, I'm

09:43.125 --> 09:45.250
sorry Robert and I--

09:45.292 --> 09:47.417
- [chuckling] Not you

09:45.292 --> 09:47.417
and Robert, no, no.

09:47.459 --> 09:50.334
You and Robert I see

09:47.459 --> 09:50.334
your faces all over town.

09:50.375 --> 09:52.000
- Well, you know what we

09:50.375 --> 09:52.000
should exchange emails,

09:52.042 --> 09:54.459
and that way keep in touch

09:52.042 --> 09:54.459
if I hear of anything.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.959
- Oh, I can do you

09:54.500 --> 09:56.959
one better. [smacking]

09:57.000 --> 09:58.709
All my contact info is on there.

09:58.751 --> 10:01.542
- Oh, professional I

09:58.751 --> 10:01.542
remember that about you.

10:01.584 --> 10:02.709
- [Jake] Yeah, yeah.

10:02.751 --> 10:03.834
- Well, it was so

10:02.751 --> 10:03.834
great running into you.

10:03.876 --> 10:05.042
- Yeah, yeah.

10:05.083 --> 10:05.876
- Bye.

10:07.042 --> 10:08.125
- Oh, Naomi.

10:08.167 --> 10:09.626
- Yeah.

10:09.667 --> 10:10.792
- Soar Eagles.

10:10.834 --> 10:12.000
- Soar!

10:10.834 --> 10:12.000
- Soar!

10:12.042 --> 10:14.751
[soft chuckling]

10:16.250 --> 10:17.375
[heavy breathing]

10:17.417 --> 10:18.876
- Good one, babe.

10:18.918 --> 10:21.542
That was a strong 10 today

10:18.918 --> 10:21.542
last sprint was great.

10:21.584 --> 10:22.375
Good.

10:22.417 --> 10:24.042
- You're gonna kill me.

10:24.083 --> 10:25.209
- Good work, good work.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.042
- Thank you.

10:27.334 --> 10:28.167
- That was good.

10:29.500 --> 10:32.042
- Oh, my god, I'm

10:29.500 --> 10:32.042
gonna get in the water.

10:32.083 --> 10:33.792
- And I'm gonna

10:32.083 --> 10:33.792
go get some water.

10:33.834 --> 10:37.500
- Oh, I forget to tell

10:33.834 --> 10:37.500
you who I ran into today.

10:37.542 --> 10:38.375
- Who?

10:39.542 --> 10:40.751
- You remember that

10:39.542 --> 10:40.751
guy I told you about

10:40.792 --> 10:42.667
from along time ago Jake?

10:42.709 --> 10:44.751
- Jake, Jake, Jake,

10:42.709 --> 10:44.751
Jake, Jake, Jake.

10:44.792 --> 10:49.000
The guy from the gig

10:44.792 --> 10:49.000
at the college, yeah.

10:49.042 --> 10:51.375
Yeah, the one they

10:49.042 --> 10:51.375
charged with murder.

10:51.417 --> 10:53.334
- He was never actually charged.

10:53.375 --> 10:54.751
He was the lead suspect.

10:54.792 --> 10:56.751
- Not charged, lead suspect

10:56.792 --> 10:58.667
it all sounds a little

10:56.792 --> 10:58.667
suspicious to me.

10:58.709 --> 11:01.542
I bet you he wasn't the

10:58.709 --> 11:01.542
most popular guy on campus.

11:01.584 --> 11:05.417
- Well, he was cleared, but

11:01.584 --> 11:05.417
by then the damage was done.

11:05.459 --> 11:07.584
And then he wanted

11:05.459 --> 11:07.584
to continue the show,

11:07.626 --> 11:10.667
but I was hesitant because

11:07.626 --> 11:10.667
of everything that happened.

11:10.709 --> 11:12.584
You know, I could

11:10.709 --> 11:12.584
tell it hurt him,

11:12.626 --> 11:15.042
and then the next thing

11:12.626 --> 11:15.042
I knew he was gone.

11:16.959 --> 11:19.042
Anyway, he seems to

11:16.959 --> 11:19.042
be doing great now.

11:19.083 --> 11:21.751
He just moved back to try and

11:19.083 --> 11:21.751
break into the bigger market

11:21.792 --> 11:23.292
and he needs a job.

11:23.334 --> 11:25.292
- Yeah, well, good.

11:25.334 --> 11:26.459
Why don't you give

11:25.334 --> 11:26.459
Scarlet a call.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.584
Maybe she could help him out.

11:28.626 --> 11:30.042
- That's a good idea.

11:30.083 --> 11:31.959
I do feel like I still

11:30.083 --> 11:31.959
owe him, you know.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.042
- I mean as long as [chuckling].

11:34.083 --> 11:35.292
- What?

11:35.334 --> 11:36.375
- Well, you don't believe

11:35.334 --> 11:36.375
that he really did

11:36.417 --> 11:37.542
what they accused him of, right?

11:37.584 --> 11:39.083
- Babe, no, I don't.

11:39.125 --> 11:40.834
- Okay, good give

11:39.125 --> 11:40.834
Scarlet a call.

11:53.250 --> 11:54.918
- So I think that bit worked.

11:54.959 --> 11:56.125
- I think, it was great the way

11:56.167 --> 11:57.626
she rolled with the audience.

11:57.667 --> 11:59.667
- Well, you know, it's a topic

11:57.667 --> 11:59.667
that our whole audience--

11:59.709 --> 12:01.000
- Another great show, guys.

12:01.042 --> 12:02.500
You have a visitor.

12:02.542 --> 12:04.250
- Hey, I'm so glad

12:02.542 --> 12:04.250
you can make it.

12:04.292 --> 12:05.375
- Of course, thanks

12:04.292 --> 12:05.375
for having me.

12:06.834 --> 12:08.584
- The old Campus Cool

12:06.834 --> 12:08.584
duo back together.

12:08.626 --> 12:10.667
- Yeah, I told her

12:08.626 --> 12:10.667
how we go way back.

12:10.709 --> 12:12.667
- Yeah, Robert, better

12:10.709 --> 12:12.667
watch out, right?

12:12.709 --> 12:13.751
- Watch out for what?

12:13.792 --> 12:15.334
- Robert, Scarlet this is an

12:15.375 --> 12:17.000
old friend of mine Jake Everett.

12:17.042 --> 12:18.500
He just moved here from Florida.

12:18.542 --> 12:20.584
He was a host at the

12:18.542 --> 12:20.584
Sunshine Network.

12:20.626 --> 12:22.250
- It's very nice

12:20.626 --> 12:22.250
to meet you, Jake.

12:22.292 --> 12:26.334
- Oh, I told Jake that he

12:22.292 --> 12:26.334
should stop by the studio,

12:26.375 --> 12:28.959
and I thought it would be

12:26.375 --> 12:28.959
good for you two to meet.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.292
- Please.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.000
Oh.

12:36.459 --> 12:41.125
Wow, you're

12:36.459 --> 12:41.125
definitely qualified.

12:41.167 --> 12:42.000
- Yeah.

12:43.500 --> 12:44.250
Well, it's...

12:46.167 --> 12:47.959
Definitely nice

12:46.167 --> 12:47.959
meeting you, Jake.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.459
I got some egg whites to eat

12:48.000 --> 12:51.459
right now, and I gotta run.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.834
- Don't make light

12:51.500 --> 12:52.834
of this, Robert,

12:52.876 --> 12:54.459
and don't forget

12:52.876 --> 12:54.459
about your shake.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.375
- Hey, she's right.

12:56.417 --> 12:59.292
- Yeah, two green

12:56.417 --> 12:59.292
shakes a day, no coffee,

12:59.334 --> 13:01.959
actually no

12:59.334 --> 13:01.959
stimulates whatsoever,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.334
yep, my life has become

13:02.000 --> 13:04.334
completely boring.

13:04.375 --> 13:06.167
- You got this.

13:06.209 --> 13:07.542
- Thank you.

13:07.584 --> 13:08.792
Abby, you got a sec I

13:07.584 --> 13:08.792
wanna run something by you.

13:08.834 --> 13:10.125
- Yeah, sure, let's do it.

13:10.167 --> 13:11.000
- Great show.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.959
- Uh, Jake, I would

13:13.834 --> 13:16.959
love to show you around.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.459
Give you a little tour.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.459
- Great.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.000
Hey, I made you something.

13:21.042 --> 13:22.584
- Oh.

13:23.918 --> 13:25.334
- Hey, Jake, let's go.

13:25.375 --> 13:27.709
Your good looks will only

13:25.375 --> 13:27.709
buy you so much time.

13:34.792 --> 13:36.083
- It's amazing.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.584
You think I could swing by

13:37.584 --> 13:39.584
tomorrow, catch a live taping?

13:39.626 --> 13:42.083
- Oh, definitely

13:39.626 --> 13:42.083
just ask for me.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.709
Oh, this is the network

13:42.125 --> 13:44.709
I gotta take this.

13:44.751 --> 13:46.584
You know your way out?

13:44.751 --> 13:46.584
- Yep, I think I can manage.

13:46.626 --> 13:47.459
- Oh, great.

13:48.459 --> 13:49.584
Yeah, this is Scarlet.

13:58.459 --> 13:59.834
[Robert gasping]

13:59.876 --> 14:01.667
- So, Abby, what

13:59.876 --> 14:01.667
were you saying?

14:01.709 --> 14:03.792
- Well, Quick Snap Live

14:01.709 --> 14:03.792
is the most popular

14:03.834 --> 14:05.959
streaming platform

14:03.834 --> 14:05.959
my generation uses,

14:06.000 --> 14:07.751
so this is it.

14:07.792 --> 14:08.751
- [Robert] Oh, wow.

14:09.751 --> 14:10.959
Yeah, no, this is exactly

14:11.000 --> 14:12.918
What Scarlet's been

14:11.000 --> 14:12.918
talkin' about we need.

14:14.334 --> 14:16.292
I'm gonna bring this up in

14:14.334 --> 14:16.292
tomorrow's preshow meeting.

14:16.334 --> 14:18.292
- [Abby] Okay, awesome,

14:16.334 --> 14:18.292
it's really interactive,

14:18.334 --> 14:20.918
so it gets the audience

14:18.334 --> 14:20.918
involved, in what we're doing,

14:20.959 --> 14:23.083
which, I think, is

14:20.959 --> 14:23.083
really gonna help us.

14:23.125 --> 14:24.375
- [Jake] Until next time.

14:24.417 --> 14:25.918
- [Group] Soar, Eagles, soar.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.500
- All right.

14:29.792 --> 14:31.375
- Such great chemistry.

14:31.417 --> 14:32.626
- Yeah, it was fun.

14:32.667 --> 14:34.709
I mean, if you block

14:32.667 --> 14:34.709
out the boot cut jeans

14:34.751 --> 14:36.417
and totally dated tube top.

14:37.626 --> 14:40.375
- Well, I'm not exactly

14:37.626 --> 14:40.375
looking at the wardrobe

14:40.417 --> 14:41.626
if you know what I mean.

14:41.667 --> 14:43.709
- Yeah, I noticed.

14:43.751 --> 14:45.751
- He's coming to the

14:43.751 --> 14:45.751
live taping tomorrow.

14:45.792 --> 14:48.959
- I saw you and Jake had

14:45.792 --> 14:48.959
some of your own chemistry.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.083
You know, I have a feeling

14:49.000 --> 14:52.083
Jake coming to town

14:52.125 --> 14:53.959
is going to be great

14:52.125 --> 14:53.959
for both of us.

14:54.876 --> 14:55.709
- I agree.

14:58.709 --> 15:01.167
- Hi, I feel so stupid.

15:01.209 --> 15:03.959
I think, I left my folder

15:01.209 --> 15:03.959
in the makeup room.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.459
- Well, no one is really

15:04.000 --> 15:07.459
in there at this time.

15:08.459 --> 15:11.250
But go ahead, Mr. Everett.

15:11.292 --> 15:14.584
- [Jake] Thank you.

15:14.626 --> 15:15.459
Thank you.

16:26.292 --> 16:29.083
[heavy grunting]

16:29.125 --> 16:30.042
- Two more.

16:37.792 --> 16:39.083
Let's get this over with.

16:48.709 --> 16:51.375
[heavy gasping]

17:02.250 --> 17:04.959
[heavy coughing]

17:08.166 --> 17:10.834
[heavy gasping]

17:12.917 --> 17:14.166
- Oh, my god, Robert.

17:15.125 --> 17:16.291
Abby, Scarlet!

17:17.459 --> 17:18.751
Help!

17:18.791 --> 17:19.876
Hurry it's Robert!

17:18.791 --> 17:19.876
- What's wrong?

17:19.917 --> 17:20.959
- Call an ambulance hurry!

17:21.000 --> 17:22.041
- [Scarlet] Oh, my god.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.917
- Robert, oh, my god.

17:23.959 --> 17:25.500
I don't know what to do, hurry.

17:26.751 --> 17:29.083
- We have an emergency

17:26.751 --> 17:29.083
at Live City Studios.

17:29.125 --> 17:30.626
I think, he's having

17:29.125 --> 17:30.626
a heart attack.

17:30.667 --> 17:31.500
- Hurry!

17:35.459 --> 17:37.584
We have to go with

17:35.459 --> 17:37.584
him to the hospital.

17:37.626 --> 17:38.459
- We can't.

17:40.459 --> 17:41.334
- What happened?

17:41.375 --> 17:42.500
- Robert had a heart attack.

17:42.542 --> 17:43.375
- What.

18:00.709 --> 18:03.250
- Alright, everyone, listen up.

18:03.292 --> 18:04.834
I know this is a sad time,

18:04.876 --> 18:06.500
and we are all deeply worried

18:06.542 --> 18:08.500
about our family member Robert.

18:08.542 --> 18:11.083
But we have to pull

18:08.542 --> 18:11.083
ourselves together.

18:11.125 --> 18:12.834
We still have a show

18:11.125 --> 18:12.834
we need to focus on.

18:12.876 --> 18:14.459
- We're going on?

18:14.500 --> 18:15.876
- Yes, the show must go on.

18:17.417 --> 18:19.626
- I don't know how I'm gonna

18:17.417 --> 18:19.626
be able to tell our audience.

18:19.667 --> 18:20.542
- You won't.

18:22.042 --> 18:24.000
The live audience doesn't

18:22.042 --> 18:24.000
arrive for another 20 minutes.

18:24.042 --> 18:25.584
No one knows about this yet.

18:27.042 --> 18:28.959
We are not in a position

18:27.042 --> 18:28.959
with the network

18:29.000 --> 18:32.042
to lose a host, not to

18:29.000 --> 18:32.042
mention, we are live,

18:32.083 --> 18:36.167
meaning there's no preemptive

18:32.083 --> 18:36.167
programming available.

18:36.209 --> 18:38.709
- So I'm supposed to go

18:36.209 --> 18:38.709
on like nothing happened.

18:38.751 --> 18:42.125
- Just for today until we

18:38.751 --> 18:42.125
can figure everything out.

18:42.167 --> 18:44.209
Alright, guys, that's the plan.

18:44.250 --> 18:45.417
Let's get back to work.

18:49.834 --> 18:50.667
- You got this.

18:51.918 --> 18:53.834
- He didn't look good, Jake.

18:53.876 --> 18:56.542
- Well, there's nothing you

18:53.876 --> 18:56.542
can do about that right now.

18:56.584 --> 18:59.125
Like Scarlet said

18:56.584 --> 18:59.125
the show must go on.

19:01.292 --> 19:02.834
Do I have to drag

19:01.292 --> 19:02.834
you up there on stage

19:02.876 --> 19:04.209
like I did the first time?

19:05.876 --> 19:06.876
You'll do great.

19:08.209 --> 19:09.417
I am gonna go.

19:09.459 --> 19:11.167
Today is not a good

19:09.459 --> 19:11.167
day to be in the way.

19:11.209 --> 19:12.584
- No, don't go.

19:12.626 --> 19:13.959
Please, I want you here.

19:15.125 --> 19:18.792
- Well, then I will

19:15.125 --> 19:18.792
be whatever you need.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.042
- Thank you.

19:27.709 --> 19:30.751
- Lights on camera three please.

19:30.792 --> 19:33.459
- [Abby] And we're live

19:30.792 --> 19:33.459
in three, two, one.

19:34.542 --> 19:37.459
[audience cheering]

19:37.500 --> 19:40.042
- Good morning, and thank you

19:40.083 --> 19:42.083
for spending your

19:40.083 --> 19:42.083
mornings with...

19:42.125 --> 19:43.626
- [Audience] Naomi and Robert.

19:45.167 --> 19:48.292
- Okay, obviously, I

19:45.167 --> 19:48.292
am a man down today.

19:48.334 --> 19:50.918
Unfortunately, my

19:48.334 --> 19:50.918
ever-present cohost

19:50.959 --> 19:53.459
is feeling under

19:50.959 --> 19:53.459
the weather today.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.459
[audience groaning sadly]

19:55.500 --> 19:56.876
But that's okay.

19:56.918 --> 19:59.751
We still have a really

19:56.918 --> 19:59.751
great show for you planned.

20:00.959 --> 20:03.209
Yes, I will be covering

20:03.250 --> 20:05.834
the current events

20:03.250 --> 20:05.834
on my own today.

20:07.292 --> 20:08.125
But don't worry.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.250
- Oh, crap she's losing it.

20:10.292 --> 20:11.751
- We really do have

20:10.292 --> 20:11.751
a great show for you.

20:11.792 --> 20:13.292
- No, no, no get in there.

20:14.334 --> 20:15.375
- What?

20:15.417 --> 20:16.918
- You did it before.

20:16.959 --> 20:18.417
You're good with her go.

20:16.959 --> 20:18.417
- It's not moving.

20:20.834 --> 20:21.959
Overseas...

20:23.042 --> 20:24.334
Just one second can you go back?

20:24.375 --> 20:25.751
'Cause I missed the headline.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.292
The teleprompter

20:25.792 --> 20:27.292

20:27.334 --> 20:28.834
'Cause I can't

20:27.334 --> 20:28.834

20:28.876 --> 20:29.834

20:31.083 --> 20:33.751
I'll be joining Naomi today.

20:33.792 --> 20:36.709
What Naomi's trying to

20:33.792 --> 20:36.709
say is in overseas news...

20:38.292 --> 20:41.584
Wait a minute, you guys don't

20:38.292 --> 20:41.584

20:41.626 --> 20:43.334

20:41.626 --> 20:43.334

20:43.375 --> 20:45.083

21:31.417 --> 21:33.292

21:31.417 --> 21:33.292

- Uh-oh, Chef Willard

Uh, keep with the

22:03.250 --> 22:05.125
We're already

22:03.250 --> 22:05.125

22:06.042 --> 22:06.876
- Okay.

22:08.250 --> 22:09.834

22:09.876 --> 22:11.167
[audience applauding]

22:11.209 --> 22:12.209
[audience cheering]

22:15.209 --> 22:16.000
Welcome, back everybody.

22:16.042 --> 22:18.292
Now our chef, Chef Willard.

22:21.042 --> 22:23.959
[Trent] Babe, I had no idea

22:21.042 --> 22:23.959
Robert was that sick.

22:25.334 --> 22:27.459
[Naomi] I knew Robert's

22:25.334 --> 22:27.459
condition was serious...

22:29.834 --> 22:32.792
but you never expect

22:29.834 --> 22:32.792
to really lose someone.

22:38.626 --> 22:42.000
- I bet he knew he was a lot...

22:42.042 --> 22:44.417
a lot more sicker

22:42.042 --> 22:44.417
than he let on.

22:46.334 --> 22:47.834
- I'm really gonna miss him.

22:49.083 --> 22:49.834
- Yeah.

22:53.459 --> 22:54.250
Yeah.

23:00.584 --> 23:03.959
- Promise me nothing is ever

23:00.584 --> 23:03.959
gonna take you away from me.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
- No, stop, stop.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
- No, promise.

23:08.292 --> 23:10.542
- Nothing's ever gonna

23:08.292 --> 23:10.542
happen, I promise.

23:11.626 --> 23:13.209
Nothing's ever

23:11.626 --> 23:13.209
gonna happen to me.

23:15.000 --> 23:15.834
Nothing.

23:17.042 --> 23:18.667
I got you.

23:18.709 --> 23:20.459
- Robert was so full of life,

23:21.542 --> 23:23.792
and he had fun in

23:21.542 --> 23:23.792
everything that he did,

23:26.125 --> 23:27.626
which is why I know that Robert

23:27.667 --> 23:30.417
would have really

23:27.667 --> 23:30.417
wanted us to spend today

23:30.459 --> 23:32.542
and have fun and

23:30.459 --> 23:32.542
celebrate his life.

23:33.709 --> 23:36.500
So thank you all so

23:33.709 --> 23:36.500
much for coming today.

23:36.542 --> 23:38.626
I really know it would've

23:36.542 --> 23:38.626
meant a lot to him.

23:42.125 --> 23:43.500
- That was lovely, babe.

23:43.542 --> 23:44.542
- Thank you.

23:49.167 --> 23:51.334
I see you guys finally

23:49.167 --> 23:51.334
got a chance to meet.

23:51.375 --> 23:53.042
- You guys did such a great job,

23:53.083 --> 23:55.167
putting all this together.

23:55.209 --> 23:57.959
I'm sure Robert is smiling down

23:58.000 --> 23:59.334
appreciating all you've done.

24:01.918 --> 24:05.000
- Um, god, please

24:01.918 --> 24:05.000
excuse the awkwardness

24:05.042 --> 24:07.500
of talking shop on

24:05.042 --> 24:07.500
such an occasion,

24:07.542 --> 24:09.792
especially one honoring Robert.

24:09.834 --> 24:13.083
But I do have some

24:09.834 --> 24:13.083
news I'd like to share.

24:14.542 --> 24:17.125
I just got the numbers back

24:17.167 --> 24:18.876
from the week that Jake

24:17.167 --> 24:18.876
has been filling in.

24:18.918 --> 24:23.209
And Mornings With

24:18.918 --> 24:23.209
Naomi and Jake are up

24:23.250 --> 24:27.000
200% in the network's

24:23.250 --> 24:27.000
new targeted demo.

24:28.209 --> 24:29.500
- Really.

24:29.542 --> 24:31.375
- That's incredible.

24:31.417 --> 24:34.417
- So, it doesn't take

24:31.417 --> 24:34.417
a genius to figure out

24:34.459 --> 24:38.000
that they, and I, and

24:34.459 --> 24:38.000
I'm assuming Naomi,

24:38.042 --> 24:40.000
would like to turn

24:38.042 --> 24:40.000
your part-time duties

24:40.042 --> 24:42.709
into a full-time replacement.

24:44.125 --> 24:48.083
- This is everything

24:44.125 --> 24:48.083
I've wanted for so long.

24:48.125 --> 24:51.500
- Then it's settled the dynamic

24:48.125 --> 24:51.500
duo are back together again.

24:51.542 --> 24:53.417
- That's my first

24:51.542 --> 24:53.417
official day here at

24:53.459 --> 24:55.000
Mornings with Naomi and Jake,

24:55.042 --> 24:57.125
and it's all thanks to you guys.

24:58.459 --> 25:01.000
- And we are very grateful

24:58.459 --> 25:01.000
to have Jake here.

25:01.042 --> 25:03.209
As always thank you

25:01.042 --> 25:03.209
for spending your

25:03.250 --> 25:05.042

25:03.250 --> 25:05.042

25:10.083 --> 25:11.626
- And we're out,

25:10.083 --> 25:11.626
house lights up.

25:11.667 --> 25:13.417
- Great job.

25:11.667 --> 25:13.417
- It was good, yeah.

25:19.250 --> 25:22.459
- [Naomi] Hmm, oh, yeah, I wish

25:19.250 --> 25:22.459
I could have another glass.

25:22.500 --> 25:25.959
But that morning comes so early.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.209
[soft chuckling]

25:29.250 --> 25:32.459
- So Trent Naomi was telling

25:29.250 --> 25:32.459
me about your latest project.

25:32.500 --> 25:34.375
I looked it up it seems amazing.

25:34.417 --> 25:36.959
- Going to change the

25:34.417 --> 25:36.959
entire face of downtown.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.250
- Great, you know I never met

25:38.292 --> 25:41.083
a super successful

25:38.292 --> 25:41.083
architect before.

25:41.125 --> 25:42.459
I would love to come

25:41.125 --> 25:42.459
down to the site

25:42.500 --> 25:45.083
and check it out

25:42.500 --> 25:45.083
if that's possible?

25:45.125 --> 25:47.709
- Of course, I'm the boss

25:45.125 --> 25:47.709
I can get you clearance.

25:47.751 --> 25:48.876
- That's great, that's great.

25:48.918 --> 25:51.209
Honestly, architecture

25:48.918 --> 25:51.209
has always been

25:51.250 --> 25:53.167
kind of a secret

25:51.250 --> 25:53.167
passion of mine.

25:53.209 --> 25:54.667
- Well, you know what

25:53.209 --> 25:54.667
you guys should do

25:54.709 --> 25:56.500
a livestream from the site.

25:56.542 --> 25:58.834
I mean, it would get people

25:56.542 --> 25:58.834
excited that are in the area,

25:58.876 --> 26:00.334
and I'm sure the

25:58.876 --> 26:00.334
investors would love

26:00.375 --> 26:01.918
the advanced publicity.

26:01.959 --> 26:03.250
- That's a great idea.

26:03.292 --> 26:04.918
I mean, involving the

26:03.292 --> 26:04.918
community even more.

26:04.959 --> 26:06.334
- Consider it done.

26:06.375 --> 26:07.459
- I'll check on it.

26:07.500 --> 26:08.542
- All right.

26:07.500 --> 26:08.542
- Yeah.

26:09.459 --> 26:10.792
- Okay, you guys I'm sorry,

26:10.834 --> 26:13.125
but some of us have a

26:10.834 --> 26:13.125
4:00 a.m. wake up call.

26:15.167 --> 26:17.792
- Well, I will see you down at

26:15.167 --> 26:17.792
the site sometime soon then.

26:17.834 --> 26:19.417
- Yeah, yeah, I'm

26:17.834 --> 26:19.417
looking forward to it.

26:19.459 --> 26:21.250
Can I leave something?

26:19.459 --> 26:21.250
- No, no, I got this.

26:21.292 --> 26:22.667
- You sure.

26:21.292 --> 26:22.667
- Go, go, go, yeah.

26:22.709 --> 26:23.834
- Okay.

26:22.709 --> 26:23.834
- All right.

26:23.876 --> 26:25.000
- Bye, sweetie.

26:23.876 --> 26:25.000
- See you in the morning.

26:25.042 --> 26:27.292
- I'll see you tomorrow.

26:25.042 --> 26:27.292
- Bye.

27:03.375 --> 27:06.042
[heavy sighing]

28:24.083 --> 28:27.542
[heavy breathing]

28:27.584 --> 28:28.417
- Check my phone.

28:30.167 --> 28:31.751
- I know that look.

28:33.167 --> 28:34.459
- It's Jake.

28:34.500 --> 28:36.125
He's just letting me

28:34.500 --> 28:36.125
know that he's gonna be

28:36.167 --> 28:38.834
live with Trent down

28:36.167 --> 28:38.834
at the site in a few.

28:38.876 --> 28:41.584
- Is he letting you

28:38.876 --> 28:41.584
know anything else?

28:41.626 --> 28:43.167
- Shut up.

28:43.209 --> 28:45.083
No, but he did say that

28:43.209 --> 28:45.083
the last few nights

28:45.125 --> 28:48.292
have been, "mind blowing,"

28:45.125 --> 28:48.292
his words not mine.

28:48.334 --> 28:50.584
- Wow, so things are heating up.

28:50.626 --> 28:52.125
- Girl, it's been hot.

28:55.709 --> 28:58.083
Were you two really

28:55.709 --> 28:58.083
always just friends?

28:58.125 --> 28:59.542
- Yes.

28:59.584 --> 29:00.918
- God, I just find

28:59.584 --> 29:00.918
that hard to believe.

29:00.959 --> 29:03.500
I mean, he's the whole package.

29:03.542 --> 29:05.250
- I mean, I guess

29:03.542 --> 29:05.250
there was a moment

29:05.292 --> 29:06.751
where maybe I thought

29:05.292 --> 29:06.751
there could be more,

29:06.792 --> 29:09.751
but I didn't wanna

29:06.792 --> 29:09.751
interfere with the show.

29:09.792 --> 29:11.334
- Always the professional.

29:11.375 --> 29:15.000
- And then he left for school,

29:11.375 --> 29:15.000
and I didn't see him since.

29:15.042 --> 29:17.500
I literally bumped into

29:15.042 --> 29:17.500
it a couple weeks ago.

29:17.542 --> 29:18.751
- I mean, all that time

29:18.792 --> 29:20.542
and you guys never

29:18.792 --> 29:20.542
talked or anything.

29:20.584 --> 29:22.834
- Things didn't exactly

29:20.584 --> 29:22.834
end on the best of terms.

29:22.876 --> 29:24.667
- Oh, feelings got involved.

29:24.709 --> 29:26.167
- No, nothing like that.

29:27.751 --> 29:31.167
- You know, I wanted to

29:27.751 --> 29:31.167
ask you something else.

29:31.209 --> 29:32.792
- No, I don't care that my boss

29:32.834 --> 29:34.375
and my costar are gettin' it on

29:34.417 --> 29:36.167
and taking the show

29:34.417 --> 29:36.167
to the bedroom.

29:37.417 --> 29:38.542
- No, it's um...

29:40.083 --> 29:44.167
I wanted to ask you does the

29:40.083 --> 29:44.167
name Cole Smith sound familiar?

29:45.334 --> 29:47.000
- Who said that name

29:45.334 --> 29:47.000
to you, what Jake?

29:47.042 --> 29:49.334
- No, no, no, um, it's just

29:49.375 --> 29:51.292
someone made a

29:49.375 --> 29:51.292
not-so-nice comment

29:51.334 --> 29:54.375
about a Cole Smith

29:51.334 --> 29:54.375
on the stream thread,

29:54.417 --> 29:56.500
and I didn't know if that

29:54.417 --> 29:56.500
sounded familiar to you or not.

29:56.542 --> 29:59.792
- Cole Smith is the name of

29:56.542 --> 29:59.792
the quarterback of our school.

29:59.834 --> 30:01.167
He was murdered.

30:01.209 --> 30:04.209
- Oh, what does that

30:01.209 --> 30:04.209
have to do with Jake?

30:10.042 --> 30:11.584
- Get a load of this.

30:12.792 --> 30:14.709
What do you guys think?

30:14.751 --> 30:16.250
Oh, they love it look at that.

30:16.292 --> 30:17.500
Look at chief.

30:17.542 --> 30:18.375
Wow.

30:20.125 --> 30:23.250
Okay, looks like

30:20.125 --> 30:23.250
we are out of time.

30:23.292 --> 30:24.876
Thank you all for tuning in.

30:24.918 --> 30:26.375
Be sure to watch us bright

30:24.918 --> 30:26.375
and early tomorrow morning.

30:26.417 --> 30:28.584
We got a great show for

30:26.417 --> 30:28.584
you live from the studio.

30:28.626 --> 30:30.209
Say goodbye, Trent.

30:28.626 --> 30:30.209
- Bye, guys.

30:30.250 --> 30:31.334
- [Jake] See ya.

30:31.375 --> 30:32.834
- [chuckling] That was fun.

30:32.876 --> 30:34.334
The people seemed to be excited.

30:34.375 --> 30:36.167
- Oh, yeah, this is great

30:34.375 --> 30:36.167
for us, thanks again.

30:36.209 --> 30:38.083
- I'll give you the tour.

30:36.209 --> 30:38.083
- Are you sure?

30:38.125 --> 30:39.751
- Of course, you're

30:38.125 --> 30:39.751
my special guest.

30:39.792 --> 30:41.417
But we need to get

30:39.792 --> 30:41.417
you a hard hat first.

30:41.459 --> 30:42.250
- Okay.

30:47.334 --> 30:48.834
- Wait I don't get it?

30:50.083 --> 30:52.918
I mean, if Jake was

30:50.083 --> 30:52.918
wrongfully accused,

30:52.959 --> 30:55.709
then why can't you guys just

30:52.959 --> 30:55.709
pick up where you left off?

30:55.751 --> 30:58.667
- Even though I knew Jake

30:55.751 --> 30:58.667
could never kill someone.

31:01.083 --> 31:01.918
- What?

31:03.250 --> 31:05.459
- You know, after

31:03.250 --> 31:05.459
everything that happened,

31:05.500 --> 31:07.375
we really couldn't pick

31:05.500 --> 31:07.375
up where we left off,

31:07.417 --> 31:09.876
I mean, at least

31:07.417 --> 31:09.876
not with the show.

31:09.918 --> 31:11.292
- Yeah.

31:09.918 --> 31:11.292
- So, you know,

31:11.334 --> 31:12.542
Jake made it very clear

31:12.584 --> 31:15.417
that Campus Cool meant

31:12.584 --> 31:15.417
everything to him.

31:15.459 --> 31:17.959
I never meant to hurt

31:15.459 --> 31:17.959
him, you know, but I did.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.876
So that's why when he

31:18.000 --> 31:19.876
popped back up into town,

31:19.918 --> 31:21.375
I wanted to help him,

31:21.417 --> 31:22.876
and that's why this

31:21.417 --> 31:22.876
show is so special to me

31:22.918 --> 31:26.083
because it's like

31:22.918 --> 31:26.083
a second chance.

31:26.125 --> 31:28.751
- Did they ever catch

31:26.125 --> 31:28.751
the guy who did it?

31:28.792 --> 31:30.918
- A she actually.

31:30.959 --> 31:33.959
Guys ex-girlfriend Lana Jones.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.584
I heard not to long ago

31:35.626 --> 31:38.125
she was released

31:35.626 --> 31:38.125
early for retrial.

31:38.167 --> 31:40.709
I don't know something

31:38.167 --> 31:40.709
about insufficient evidence.

31:42.459 --> 31:44.751
Anyway I'm gonna head

31:42.459 --> 31:44.751
back to the studio

31:44.792 --> 31:46.918
and get a little extra

31:44.792 --> 31:46.918
prep in for tomorrow.

31:46.959 --> 31:48.918
- Of course, you are I'll

31:46.959 --> 31:48.918
see you in the morning.

31:48.959 --> 31:49.792
- [Naomi] Bye.

32:04.709 --> 32:07.000
- I would love a

32:04.709 --> 32:07.000
beer you want one?

32:07.042 --> 32:08.959
- No, no, no, no I'm

32:07.042 --> 32:08.959
still on the clock.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.959
- Come on, you're celebrating.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.417
Let me get you one.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.417
- Okay.

32:15.500 --> 32:18.042
- Hi, two beers please.

32:18.083 --> 32:18.918
Thank you.

32:20.751 --> 32:21.584
Thanks.

32:32.083 --> 32:34.167
Here you go, sir.

32:34.209 --> 32:35.042
Cheers.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.209
To new ventures.

32:37.250 --> 32:39.709
- Speaking of, you

32:37.250 --> 32:39.709
and Scarlet, huh?

32:39.751 --> 32:41.542
- Oh, yeah.

32:41.584 --> 32:44.125
Yeah, we'll see. I know

32:41.584 --> 32:44.125
it's not the smartest thing

32:44.167 --> 32:45.375
to get involved with your boss,

32:45.417 --> 32:47.792
but not everyone has

32:45.417 --> 32:47.792
what you and Naomi have.

32:47.834 --> 32:48.709
It's tough out there.

32:48.751 --> 32:50.000
- Yeah, I remember.

32:53.542 --> 32:54.792
- You got any tips on

32:55.709 --> 32:56.918
how you make her so happy?

32:58.751 --> 33:01.083
- After three years, I

32:58.751 --> 33:01.083
think, it's just really

33:01.125 --> 33:03.667
about paying attention

33:01.125 --> 33:03.667
to what she likes.

33:03.709 --> 33:08.250
- Oh, yeah, I remember in

33:03.709 --> 33:08.250
college it was chicken nuggets

33:08.292 --> 33:10.334
and vanilla milkshakes

33:08.292 --> 33:10.334
from Johnny's Diner.

33:10.375 --> 33:12.918
- Yeah, she told me about

33:10.375 --> 33:12.918
your late-night meeting

33:12.959 --> 33:14.500
in your special booth.

33:14.542 --> 33:17.125
- Oh, wow, she told

33:14.542 --> 33:17.125
you about that, yeah.

33:18.334 --> 33:20.250
- I used to get jealous until

33:18.334 --> 33:20.250
I married her and forgave her.

33:20.292 --> 33:23.417
[soft chuckling]

33:23.459 --> 33:26.042
- I'm sure her tastes have

33:23.459 --> 33:26.042
changed since college though.

33:27.125 --> 33:28.334
- Don't be too sure about that.

33:28.375 --> 33:29.918
- Hmm?

33:28.375 --> 33:29.918
- No.

33:29.959 --> 33:31.375
She loves purple tulips,

33:32.959 --> 33:36.125
long jogs in the park,

33:32.959 --> 33:36.125
uninterrupted I made add,

33:36.167 --> 33:38.459
and, yes, she still

33:36.167 --> 33:38.459
loves vanilla milkshakes,

33:38.500 --> 33:40.584
and now that Johnny's

33:38.500 --> 33:40.584
is out of business,

33:41.751 --> 33:43.292
the Shake Barn is her

33:41.751 --> 33:43.292
favorite place now.

33:43.334 --> 33:44.667
- Shake Barn.

33:43.334 --> 33:44.667
- Yeah.

33:45.751 --> 33:47.125
- I'll have to check that out.

33:49.751 --> 33:51.083
- Listen I don't know how much

33:51.125 --> 33:53.125
Naomi has told you

33:51.125 --> 33:53.125
about our college days,

33:53.167 --> 33:56.792
but I want you to

33:53.167 --> 33:56.792
know one man to other,

33:58.000 --> 34:00.959
you've got yourself

33:58.000 --> 34:00.959
a very special woman.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.918
I noticed it the

34:01.000 --> 34:02.918
first time I saw her.

34:05.417 --> 34:06.417
- I appreciate that.

34:08.667 --> 34:11.583
Yeah, this reunion and the

34:08.667 --> 34:11.583
show has made Naomi very happy.

34:13.292 --> 34:16.667
- You know what they say:

34:13.292 --> 34:16.667
Happy wife, happy life.

34:16.708 --> 34:18.292
- You got that right my friend.

34:22.125 --> 34:22.958
- You okay, Bud?

34:24.375 --> 34:25.208
- Yeah.

34:26.542 --> 34:27.708
Yeah, eh, no.

34:29.125 --> 34:31.958
Wow, I just got really dizzy.

34:35.042 --> 34:38.167
You know what I need

34:35.042 --> 34:38.167
to get back to work.

34:38.208 --> 34:39.751
- Yeah, I'll take

34:38.208 --> 34:39.751
care of this here.

34:39.792 --> 34:42.583
You gotta get back for

34:39.792 --> 34:42.583
your inspection, right?

34:42.626 --> 34:43.542
- Yeah.

34:42.626 --> 34:43.542
- Yeah.

34:47.958 --> 34:48.792
- Whoa.

34:47.958 --> 34:48.792
- Whoa.

34:50.458 --> 34:52.292
Sure you're okay?

34:50.458 --> 34:52.292
- It's just...

34:54.833 --> 34:56.000
- You okay?

34:54.833 --> 34:56.000
- Yeah, yeah.

34:56.042 --> 34:57.125
- [Jake] No, this one

34:56.042 --> 34:57.125
here let's go here.

34:57.167 --> 34:58.876
- It was a half a beer, right?

34:58.918 --> 35:00.918
- Yeah, alright,

34:58.918 --> 35:00.918
you should be fine.

35:03.250 --> 35:06.542
[Trent breathing heavily]

35:06.584 --> 35:08.167
You look good, you look better.

35:08.209 --> 35:09.834
- It was a half of a beer, man.

35:09.876 --> 35:12.292
- [Jake] I know it's nothing.

35:09.876 --> 35:12.292
- I got it, I got it.

35:12.334 --> 35:13.125
- You good?

35:12.334 --> 35:13.125
- Hmm-mm.

35:13.167 --> 35:14.000
- Okay.

35:15.584 --> 35:17.876
I'll get the door for you.

35:21.918 --> 35:24.250
- It was a half a beer.

35:21.918 --> 35:24.250
- Yeah.

35:29.709 --> 35:30.876
- Am I alright to drive?

35:29.709 --> 35:30.876
- Yeah?

35:30.918 --> 35:32.792
- I'm alright, right?

35:30.918 --> 35:32.792
- You're good.

35:32.834 --> 35:33.834
Don't worry about it.

35:33.876 --> 35:34.709
- Okay.

35:36.125 --> 35:37.459
Keys, keys, keys.

35:38.792 --> 35:39.709
Okay, okay.

35:42.459 --> 35:43.751
All right.

35:43.792 --> 35:46.209
[car engine revving]

35:46.250 --> 35:47.083
Okay.

35:48.125 --> 35:48.918
Let's go.

36:00.417 --> 36:03.083
[soft groaning]

36:54.417 --> 36:55.626
- This will not be

36:54.417 --> 36:55.626
good for community

36:55.667 --> 36:57.292
confidence in the

36:55.667 --> 36:57.292
project, Trent,

36:59.292 --> 37:01.375
not that you'll be

36:59.292 --> 37:01.375
around to see it.

37:08.125 --> 37:11.209
[car engine revving]

37:35.125 --> 37:36.375
Extra thick

37:37.459 --> 37:38.834
with whip cream.

37:38.876 --> 37:39.709
- What?

37:38.876 --> 37:39.709
- Right.

37:40.918 --> 37:42.667
- Yes, you remembered?

37:42.709 --> 37:44.459
- How could I forget.

37:44.500 --> 37:46.334
It's no Johnny's, but.

37:47.250 --> 37:49.083
- Shake Barn next best thing.

37:50.667 --> 37:52.000
- Trent mentioned you were

37:50.667 --> 37:52.000
gonna be sticking around

37:52.042 --> 37:53.792
a little later tonight.

37:52.042 --> 37:53.792
- He did?

37:53.834 --> 37:56.125
Yeah, he didn't tell you.

37:56.167 --> 37:58.334
Yeah, he took me to lunch today.

37:58.375 --> 37:59.542
I guess, he wanted

37:58.375 --> 37:59.542
to thank me for

37:59.584 --> 38:01.876
doing the livestream

37:59.584 --> 38:01.876
from the site.

38:01.918 --> 38:04.626
- No, he didn't tell me. You

38:01.918 --> 38:04.626
guys are like real buds now.

38:04.667 --> 38:06.375
- I guess so, yeah.

38:07.709 --> 38:11.626
Speaking of which, I obviously

38:07.709 --> 38:11.626
care about guys a lot,

38:11.667 --> 38:15.042
so I hope it's not out of

38:11.667 --> 38:15.042
place for me to bring this up.

38:15.083 --> 38:16.417
- Bring what up?

38:17.584 --> 38:19.500
- Never mind I'm

38:17.584 --> 38:19.500
sure it's nothing.

38:19.542 --> 38:21.042
- No, tell me we're friends.

38:23.709 --> 38:28.459
- Well, just does Trent

38:23.709 --> 38:28.459
sometimes drink on the job?

38:29.792 --> 38:31.584
- I mean, he might have a beer

38:31.626 --> 38:33.375
with lunch every now and then.

38:33.417 --> 38:36.209
- Okay. 'cause he

38:33.417 --> 38:36.209
had a few today,

38:36.250 --> 38:40.500
and I didn't think he was

38:36.250 --> 38:40.500
in any condition to drive.

38:40.542 --> 38:41.667
I tried to stop him,

38:41.709 --> 38:44.083
but he kept insisting

38:41.709 --> 38:44.083
he was fine.

38:44.125 --> 38:45.709
- Well, that doesn't

38:44.125 --> 38:45.709
sound like Trent at all.

38:45.751 --> 38:47.751
- Look, I'm sure it's nothing.

38:47.792 --> 38:49.209
Maybe he's just stressed out.

38:49.250 --> 38:52.334
He's under a lot of pressure

38:49.250 --> 38:52.334
with this new project.

38:52.375 --> 38:53.209
- Yeah, maybe.

38:54.375 --> 38:56.751
- Well, I gotta run,

38:54.375 --> 38:56.751
enjoy that shake.

38:56.792 --> 38:57.626
- Thank you.

39:07.584 --> 39:09.167
Hello, this is Naomi.

39:11.334 --> 39:12.667
Yes, he is my husband.

39:15.125 --> 39:16.626
Oh, my god.

39:16.667 --> 39:18.709
Yes, I'll be right there.

39:18.751 --> 39:19.667
Oh, my god.

39:41.167 --> 39:42.375
- [Chad] You have

39:41.167 --> 39:42.375
reached Chad Woods.

39:42.417 --> 39:44.292
Leave a message, and I

39:42.417 --> 39:44.292
will get back to you.

39:44.334 --> 39:45.959
Have a sun filled day.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.334
- Hi, there this is Scarlet Lee

39:47.375 --> 39:48.959
calling from Live City Studies.

39:50.375 --> 39:52.584
I'm calling about

39:50.375 --> 39:52.584
a Jake Everett.

39:52.626 --> 39:54.584
I've recently employed him,

39:54.626 --> 39:57.167
and I know that he was a

39:54.626 --> 39:57.167
former employee of yours.

39:57.209 --> 39:58.459
And I know he's coming off of a

39:58.500 --> 40:00.000
successful run

39:58.500 --> 40:00.000
with your network,

40:00.042 --> 40:02.167
and I just had a couple

40:00.042 --> 40:02.167
of questions for you.

40:02.209 --> 40:03.500
If you'd please

40:02.209 --> 40:03.500
give me a call back,

40:03.542 --> 40:05.459
I'd really appreciate

40:03.542 --> 40:05.459
it, thank you.

40:08.459 --> 40:10.667
- [Nurse] Good morning.

40:10.709 --> 40:13.834
- Oh, ma'am, no, you're

40:10.709 --> 40:13.834
supposed to sit back on.

40:13.876 --> 40:15.626
[man groaning]

40:15.667 --> 40:19.250
- Annie, get in here

40:15.667 --> 40:19.250
I need my syringes!

40:19.292 --> 40:21.876
[man groaning]

40:40.500 --> 40:43.083
[soft sobbing]

41:06.000 --> 41:08.709
[heavy sighing]

41:12.751 --> 41:14.167
- Hey.

41:14.209 --> 41:16.375
- [Naomi] Hey, you're up.

41:18.292 --> 41:19.125
- Barely.

41:21.709 --> 41:23.584
- It's gonna be okay, okay?

41:24.959 --> 41:28.667
What's important now is

41:24.959 --> 41:28.667
that you get your rest.

41:28.709 --> 41:30.709
- I just don't

41:28.709 --> 41:30.709
understand what happened.

41:31.751 --> 41:33.417
I mean, the last

41:31.751 --> 41:33.417
thing I remember

41:34.542 --> 41:36.918
is having a beer

41:34.542 --> 41:36.918
with Jake, and then.

41:37.876 --> 41:39.417
- It was an accident.

41:39.459 --> 41:40.876
You've been working so hard.

41:40.918 --> 41:42.834
You probably didn't know

41:40.918 --> 41:42.834
how run down you were.

41:42.876 --> 41:44.542
We both didn't.

41:44.584 --> 41:46.584
- No, I wasn't run down.

41:46.626 --> 41:48.042
I would've known.

41:49.250 --> 41:50.751
- Maybe you had

41:49.250 --> 41:50.751
too much to drink.

41:50.792 --> 41:53.792
- What, no, I had one beer.

41:53.834 --> 41:56.042
- You know what let's not

41:53.834 --> 41:56.042
worry about that right now.

41:56.083 --> 41:58.334
I am just so grateful

41:56.083 --> 41:58.334
that you are okay.

42:07.500 --> 42:10.209
- Why don't you go

42:07.500 --> 42:10.209
home and get some rest?

42:10.250 --> 42:11.459
- [Naomi] No.

42:11.500 --> 42:12.626
- Look who's up.

42:14.500 --> 42:16.292
I knew you wouldn't

42:14.500 --> 42:16.292
be out for too long.

42:16.334 --> 42:17.792
- Yeah, for now.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.709
I was just telling Naomi

42:19.000 --> 42:20.709
that she should go home

42:20.751 --> 42:21.542
and get some rest.

42:21.584 --> 42:23.626
- I'm not leaving you.

42:23.667 --> 42:26.584
- But you have a show to do.

42:26.626 --> 42:28.125
- You're more important

42:26.626 --> 42:28.125
than the show,

42:28.167 --> 42:30.959
and I'm gonna stay here

42:28.167 --> 42:30.959
as long as you need me,

42:31.000 --> 42:32.918
and I know you

42:31.000 --> 42:32.918
would do the same.

42:32.959 --> 42:36.834
- Yes, I would, but I don't

42:32.959 --> 42:36.834
have Scarlet to answer to.

42:36.876 --> 42:38.125
- He's got a point there.

42:39.042 --> 42:40.459
- Besides I'm gonna be fine.

42:41.834 --> 42:44.000
The show must go on.

42:41.834 --> 42:44.000
- Well, be that as it may,

42:44.042 --> 42:45.626
you don't need to

42:44.042 --> 42:45.626
worry about that.

42:45.667 --> 42:47.125
You just focus on resting up.

42:48.834 --> 42:50.334
Maybe he's right.

42:50.375 --> 42:53.751
Maybe it would be good to check

42:50.375 --> 42:53.751
in at home come back later.

42:53.792 --> 42:55.167
- Yeah, if you're not

42:53.792 --> 42:55.167
gonna listen to me,

42:55.209 --> 42:56.375
at least listen to Jake.

42:59.626 --> 43:00.792
- [Jake] I can take ya.

43:03.292 --> 43:05.167
- Okay.

43:03.292 --> 43:05.167
- Thanks, Jake.

43:05.209 --> 43:06.292
- [Naomi] I love you.

43:07.125 --> 43:08.250
- I love you too.

43:08.292 --> 43:11.167
Hey, you take care of my wife.

43:11.209 --> 43:12.042
- You bet.

43:41.459 --> 43:42.542
- Thank you.

43:43.459 --> 43:44.959
- You good?

44:08.167 --> 44:11.584
- Okay... there we go.

44:13.083 --> 44:14.834
Three scrambled eggs,

44:14.876 --> 44:16.375
not too runny but still soft.

44:16.417 --> 44:20.918
Oh, and, ketchup on the side.

44:22.209 --> 44:25.167
- Wow, you really do

44:22.209 --> 44:25.167
remember everything.

44:25.209 --> 44:29.000
- All those late-night

44:25.209 --> 44:29.000
breakfasts at Johnny's Diner

44:29.042 --> 44:30.959
in our booth

44:29.042 --> 44:30.959
after our shows,

44:31.000 --> 44:32.542
I think, I could order for you.

44:35.918 --> 44:38.834
Hey, just so you know,

44:35.918 --> 44:38.834
if you really feel like

44:38.876 --> 44:40.542
you can't go on air tomorrow,

44:40.584 --> 44:42.125
I'm comfortable flying solo.

44:43.584 --> 44:47.876
You just take your time, do

44:43.584 --> 44:47.876
what's best for you and Trent.

44:47.918 --> 44:50.834
- Thank you, but Scarlet

44:47.918 --> 44:50.834
should be here any second

44:50.876 --> 44:52.709
to come up with a game plan.

44:52.751 --> 44:55.209
I'm sure she has

44:52.751 --> 44:55.209
some creative twist

44:55.250 --> 44:58.584
to work in my husband's

44:55.250 --> 44:58.584
near-death experience.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.834
- Well, I've always got

45:21.000 --> 45:23.834
your back, know that.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
You need to be taken

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
care of right now.

45:27.918 --> 45:28.751
- And Trent.

45:29.834 --> 45:30.918
- Right, and Trent.

45:35.751 --> 45:36.626
- Hello.

45:37.667 --> 45:38.500
Naomi.

45:41.667 --> 45:42.500
Hello.

45:44.918 --> 45:46.000
Naomi.

45:48.292 --> 45:49.125
Oh.

45:51.834 --> 45:53.792
I didn't know you

45:51.834 --> 45:53.792
were gonna be here.

45:54.834 --> 45:56.792
- Jake just dropped me off.

45:56.834 --> 45:58.459
- And you made breakfast.

45:58.500 --> 45:59.334
- He did.

46:00.500 --> 46:01.834
- Oh, wow.

46:01.876 --> 46:03.459
You really can do it all, huh?

46:03.500 --> 46:06.375
- I had completely forgotten

46:03.500 --> 46:06.375
to eat since the accident.

46:07.792 --> 46:11.334
- Well, I guess, it's good

46:07.792 --> 46:11.334
that you're both here.

46:11.375 --> 46:12.918
Now that Trent is on the mend,

46:12.959 --> 46:15.584
we can talk about moving

46:12.959 --> 46:15.584
forward with the show.

46:15.626 --> 46:18.584
- I told Naomi that

46:15.626 --> 46:18.584
I could host solo

46:18.626 --> 46:19.792
till she feels up to it.

46:20.709 --> 46:22.834
- I'm open to that.

46:22.876 --> 46:25.334
- No, I'll go on.

46:25.375 --> 46:26.959
I think, it's best for me.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.417
- You know, maybe we can

46:27.000 --> 46:29.417
use this to our advantage.

46:29.459 --> 46:32.125
You know, try to go after

46:29.459 --> 46:32.125
the audience's heart,

46:32.167 --> 46:33.918
boost our ratings even more.

46:33.959 --> 46:35.375
- Let's not go there.

46:37.292 --> 46:38.751
- Okay, I'm sorry.

46:38.792 --> 46:41.709
I sometimes forget to turn

46:38.792 --> 46:41.709
off my producer switch.

46:43.542 --> 46:45.709
- You know, I like eggs too.

46:45.751 --> 46:47.250
- Oh, right, of course.

46:51.542 --> 46:54.209
- So, how did you feel?

46:54.250 --> 46:55.542
How did you feel about it?

46:55.584 --> 46:57.000
- I think, good, yeah.

46:57.042 --> 46:59.876
- Well, I think

46:57.042 --> 46:59.876
you were fantastic.

46:59.918 --> 47:01.709
I mean, I knew you'd

46:59.918 --> 47:01.709
pull it together

47:01.751 --> 47:03.334
once the camera started rolling.

47:04.751 --> 47:08.209
Oh, and what you sprinkled

47:04.751 --> 47:08.209
in about Trent's injury

47:08.250 --> 47:11.667
I mean, you came

47:08.250 --> 47:11.667
across vulnerable

47:11.709 --> 47:13.876
while yet still

47:11.709 --> 47:13.876
remaining your strong

47:13.918 --> 47:17.459
independent woman that

47:13.918 --> 47:17.459
everyone knows and loves.

47:17.500 --> 47:18.250
- Thank you.

47:20.709 --> 47:24.375
- Hey, do you remember

47:20.709 --> 47:24.375
what you told me about Jake

47:24.417 --> 47:26.584
being accused of

47:24.417 --> 47:26.584
murder back in college?

47:26.626 --> 47:27.751
- Of course, why?

47:29.709 --> 47:32.125
- What was the last you

47:29.709 --> 47:32.125
heard of Lana Jones?

47:33.125 --> 47:34.500
- Just what I told you.

47:34.542 --> 47:35.876
Her case was thrown out,

47:35.918 --> 47:38.751
and then she was released

47:35.918 --> 47:38.751
a few years later.

47:38.792 --> 47:40.292
Where is all this coming from?

47:41.542 --> 47:45.584
- Well, "LJ1" is the one

47:41.542 --> 47:45.584
who's been writing those

47:45.626 --> 47:47.792
weird unpleasant messages.

47:49.042 --> 47:51.083
I'm assuming that's her, right?

47:51.125 --> 47:51.959
- Are you sure?

47:53.125 --> 47:55.292
- Unless it's a

47:53.125 --> 47:55.292
crazy coincidence.

47:57.292 --> 48:00.959
Look we can't risk even the

47:57.292 --> 48:00.959
slightest hint of a scandal.

48:01.959 --> 48:04.042
We have to protect the show.

48:04.083 --> 48:05.292
- Yeah, of course.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.459
- [Scarlet] Oh, is it good news.

48:10.500 --> 48:13.209
- Yes, okay, so they're just

48:10.500 --> 48:13.209
waiting on some blood work

48:13.250 --> 48:15.375
to come back but they think

48:13.250 --> 48:15.375
he's gonna be released soon.

48:15.417 --> 48:16.918
He should be home

48:15.417 --> 48:16.918
in a couple days.

48:16.959 --> 48:18.792
- That is good news.

48:18.834 --> 48:20.417
- Hi, look at you.

48:21.834 --> 48:24.542
How sweet, you just keep

48:21.834 --> 48:24.542
getting better and better.

48:24.584 --> 48:26.292
- These are actually for Naomi.

48:26.334 --> 48:27.209
- Oh.

48:27.250 --> 48:29.125
- Oh.

48:27.250 --> 48:29.125
- Thank you.

48:29.167 --> 48:30.500
- I knew you had

48:29.167 --> 48:30.500
a tough day today,

48:30.542 --> 48:32.209
and I'm sure all your

48:30.542 --> 48:32.209
thoughts are with Trent

48:32.250 --> 48:34.292
so I just wanted to brighten

48:32.250 --> 48:34.292
your day a little bit.

48:34.334 --> 48:36.626
- These are my favorite.

48:36.667 --> 48:37.792
- Of course, they are.

49:06.709 --> 49:09.083
- Doing real good today.

49:09.125 --> 49:11.292
You doing very good today.

49:13.876 --> 49:16.584
- Hi, guys.

49:13.876 --> 49:16.584
- Hey.

49:16.626 --> 49:19.125
- How are you doing today?

49:16.626 --> 49:19.125
- All right.

49:19.167 --> 49:21.334
- I brought you a pudding.

49:19.167 --> 49:21.334
- Oh, how thoughtful.

49:21.375 --> 49:23.667
- [Nurse] It's the only

49:21.375 --> 49:23.667
thing edible in here.

49:23.709 --> 49:26.000
And one for you.

49:23.709 --> 49:26.000
- Oh, my god.

49:26.042 --> 49:30.459
- [Woman] We are

49:26.042 --> 49:30.459
assumed discharged

49:26.042 --> 49:30.459
usually within 12 hours.

49:32.417 --> 49:36.083
[people chatting distantly]

49:42.250 --> 49:43.083
- Okay, yeah.

49:46.751 --> 49:47.584
Can I help you?

49:51.375 --> 49:52.834
Jake Everett.

49:54.250 --> 49:55.876
I am a huge fan.

49:54.250 --> 49:55.876
- Oh, thank you.

49:55.918 --> 49:57.792
Thank you so much.

49:57.834 --> 50:00.876
Sorry is it okay if I steal

49:57.834 --> 50:00.876
one of these puddings?

50:00.918 --> 50:03.125
- Yeah, of course.

50:03.167 --> 50:04.876
Pudding for a picture.

50:04.918 --> 50:06.500
- That's a deal let's do it.

50:06.542 --> 50:08.167
- Okay, my phone's right here.

50:12.292 --> 50:13.584
Got it.

50:12.292 --> 50:13.584
- Awesome, that looks great.

50:13.626 --> 50:15.250
- Thank you so much.

50:13.626 --> 50:15.250
- Fantastic.

50:15.292 --> 50:16.334
You're welcome.

50:15.292 --> 50:16.334
- You sure know how

50:16.375 --> 50:17.667
to make a girl's day.

50:17.709 --> 50:19.584
- [Jake] Thanks,

50:17.709 --> 50:19.584
doll, you're the best.

50:19.626 --> 50:20.709
- [Nurse] Here we go.

50:20.751 --> 50:22.375
- Thank you.

50:20.751 --> 50:22.375
- Okay, yeah.

50:23.375 --> 50:25.626
Oh, don't forget a spoon.

50:46.125 --> 50:48.334
[cellphone ringing]

50:46.125 --> 50:48.334
- Hello, this is Scarlet Lee.

50:48.375 --> 50:51.334
- Ms. Lee, I apologize

50:48.375 --> 50:51.334
for the delayed response.

50:51.375 --> 50:54.584
I'm not sure where you

50:51.375 --> 50:54.584
received your information.

50:54.626 --> 50:57.042
But we terminated Mr. Everett.

50:57.083 --> 50:59.125
- Terminated, why?

50:59.167 --> 51:01.584
- I'm not allowed

50:59.167 --> 51:01.584
to get into detail.

51:01.626 --> 51:03.876
Let's just say it had

51:01.626 --> 51:03.876
to do with his past.

51:03.918 --> 51:05.584
- And does this past, by chance

51:05.626 --> 51:08.125
have anything to do

51:05.626 --> 51:08.125
with a Lana Jones?

51:08.167 --> 51:10.500
- Bingo, sounds like

51:08.167 --> 51:10.500
you've done some homework.

51:11.459 --> 51:13.959
I, obviously can't recommend him

51:14.000 --> 51:15.417
for employment at this time.

51:17.918 --> 51:19.459
- Got it.

51:17.918 --> 51:19.459
- Good.

51:19.500 --> 51:21.292
Ms. Lee, trust me.

51:21.334 --> 51:24.626
There's a lot of things

51:21.334 --> 51:24.626
I'd like to say about Jake.

51:24.667 --> 51:27.959
But this whole incident

51:24.667 --> 51:27.959
already cost us a pretty penny.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.125
- Understood, thank you

51:28.000 --> 51:30.125
for calling me back.

51:30.167 --> 51:32.709
- Dr. Maslow said your blood

51:30.167 --> 51:32.709
tests results came back,

51:32.751 --> 51:35.000
and you were well under the

51:32.751 --> 51:35.000
legal limit for alcohol.

51:35.042 --> 51:36.834
So he wants to run more tests

51:36.876 --> 51:39.125
and see what could have

51:36.876 --> 51:39.125
caused this episode.

51:39.167 --> 51:42.876
- I told you I didn't

51:39.167 --> 51:42.876
drink that much that day.

51:44.375 --> 51:46.125
Jake is still

51:44.375 --> 51:46.125
coming here, right?

51:46.167 --> 51:47.792
- Yeah.

51:46.167 --> 51:47.792
[soft knocking on door]

51:47.834 --> 51:50.083
- Hey, Buddy, how

51:47.834 --> 51:50.083
you holding up?

51:50.125 --> 51:52.292
- Hey, [sighing]

51:52.334 --> 51:55.209
I still don't remember

51:52.334 --> 51:55.209
what happened that day.

51:56.292 --> 51:58.209
- Well, one thing we all know,

51:59.792 --> 52:01.292
you gotta keep eating.

52:01.334 --> 52:03.083
- Oh, he's right, babe.

52:03.125 --> 52:04.167
- Sweets are about

52:03.125 --> 52:04.167
the only thing

52:04.209 --> 52:05.626
that's edible in here, right?

52:05.667 --> 52:06.709
- You got that right.

52:12.542 --> 52:14.000
- I will leave you two.

52:12.542 --> 52:14.000
- Already.

52:14.042 --> 52:15.250
- Yeah, I gotta get to the gym,

52:15.292 --> 52:17.209
and then dinner

52:15.292 --> 52:17.209
with Scarlet, so.

52:18.417 --> 52:20.375
You guys let me know

52:18.417 --> 52:20.375
if you need anything.

52:20.417 --> 52:21.792
- Thank you.

52:21.834 --> 52:23.042
- Hey, Jake.

52:23.083 --> 52:24.292
- Yeah, Bud.

52:24.334 --> 52:26.209
- Before the accident

52:24.334 --> 52:26.209
happened that day,

52:27.334 --> 52:29.375
did you help me

52:27.334 --> 52:29.375
get into the truck?

52:29.417 --> 52:30.375
- No.

52:31.542 --> 52:34.876
No, you kept insisting

52:31.542 --> 52:34.876
you were fine.

52:34.918 --> 52:36.667
Then you took off.

52:40.751 --> 52:42.250
- I could've sworn you did.

52:43.834 --> 52:47.000
- No, maybe I should have.

52:47.042 --> 52:48.834
Maybe I shouldn't have

52:47.042 --> 52:48.834
let you drive at all.

52:48.876 --> 52:50.500
- No, it was an accident.

52:48.876 --> 52:50.500
- Yeah, yeah.

52:51.584 --> 52:52.959
Yeah, I'm just

52:51.584 --> 52:52.959
thankful you survived.

52:53.000 --> 52:53.834
- Yeah, me too.

53:15.417 --> 53:16.834
- Hey, are you okay.

53:16.876 --> 53:18.042
- Yeah, yeah, I just...

53:19.042 --> 53:20.417
I got a little light headed.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.334
- Do you want me

53:21.000 --> 53:22.334
to call the nurse?

53:22.375 --> 53:24.876
- No, no, no I'm fine.

53:26.083 --> 53:28.334
I'm just gonna close my

53:26.083 --> 53:28.334
eyes and get some rest.

53:28.375 --> 53:29.459
- Yeah, okay.

53:42.250 --> 53:45.584
[soft knocking on door]

53:53.667 --> 53:55.083
- Hi.

53:53.667 --> 53:55.083
- Hello.

53:55.125 --> 53:55.918
- Come in.

53:57.083 --> 53:58.626
- I see you look

53:57.083 --> 53:58.626
beautiful as always.

53:58.667 --> 53:59.876
- Thank you.

53:59.918 --> 54:01.042
- It smells amazing.

53:59.918 --> 54:01.042
- You're sweaty.

54:01.083 --> 54:02.959
- Yes, take a

54:01.083 --> 54:02.959
shower is that cool?

54:03.000 --> 54:04.918
- Yeah, of course, dinner won't

54:03.000 --> 54:04.918
be ready for another 20, so.

54:04.959 --> 54:06.125
- Okay.

54:04.959 --> 54:06.125
- Yeah.

55:01.000 --> 55:01.918
- Check his vitals!

55:01.959 --> 55:03.292
- [Naomi] What's going on?

55:03.334 --> 55:04.500
- Please stay back, ma'am,

55:03.334 --> 55:04.500
we're handling this!

55:04.542 --> 55:05.876
Hey, we need to get

55:04.542 --> 55:05.876
a doctor in here!

55:05.918 --> 55:07.125
- Excuse me, what's

55:05.918 --> 55:07.125
wrong with my husband?

55:07.167 --> 55:08.542
- Get her out of here please!

55:08.584 --> 55:09.375
Preparing defibrillate.

55:09.417 --> 55:10.459
- What's happening!

55:10.500 --> 55:11.751
- Get her out of here please!

55:11.792 --> 55:12.959
- What do we got?

55:11.792 --> 55:12.959
- On three.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.459
One, two, three, clear!

55:15.500 --> 55:17.334
- [Doctor] Check pulse.

55:17.375 --> 55:19.292
- None.

55:17.375 --> 55:19.292
- Start compressions.

55:19.334 --> 55:21.125
- I think, he's moving

55:19.334 --> 55:21.125
into a cardiac arrest.

55:21.167 --> 55:23.500
- Four, five, six.

55:23.542 --> 55:24.834
- [Doctor] Hit him

55:23.542 --> 55:24.834
again, a 120 joules.

55:24.876 --> 55:26.375
- Three, clear.

55:26.417 --> 55:27.959
- [Doctor] Check for pulse!

55:28.000 --> 55:28.876
Anything.

55:28.000 --> 55:28.876
- None.

55:28.918 --> 55:30.626
- Compressions.

55:28.918 --> 55:30.626
- One.

55:30.667 --> 55:32.042
- That was amazing.

55:33.751 --> 55:35.083
You are amazing.

55:36.209 --> 55:37.626
- Thank you.

55:37.667 --> 55:39.125
I'm happy to hear that.

55:39.167 --> 55:42.459
I was starting to think I was

55:39.167 --> 55:42.459
in competition with Naomi.

55:42.500 --> 55:43.334
- Naomi?

55:44.667 --> 55:46.167
That's ridiculous.

55:46.209 --> 55:47.042
You're funny too.

55:49.042 --> 55:50.000
You cooked.

55:50.042 --> 55:51.042
I will do the dishes.

55:51.083 --> 55:52.334
Why don't you go upstairs

55:52.375 --> 55:54.000
and have a nice relaxing bath.

55:54.042 --> 55:55.167
- Oh.

55:55.209 --> 55:56.042
Wow.

55:58.709 --> 55:59.542
Thank you.

56:37.083 --> 56:39.918
[water splashing]

57:11.876 --> 57:12.792
- Mrs. Spinner.

57:14.375 --> 57:17.125
First of all, your

57:14.375 --> 57:17.125
husband is one lucky man.

57:17.167 --> 57:18.209
He's gonna be okay.

57:19.459 --> 57:21.083
- What happened to him?

57:21.125 --> 57:22.918
- Well, upon reviewing

57:21.125 --> 57:22.918
the test results,

57:22.959 --> 57:24.417
it appears that your

57:22.959 --> 57:24.417
husband's symptoms

57:24.459 --> 57:27.417
are those of one who

57:24.459 --> 57:27.417
overdosed on blood thinners,

57:27.459 --> 57:29.959
which I can't

57:27.459 --> 57:29.959
possibly understand.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.417
- He's not on blood thinners.

57:31.459 --> 57:32.834
- We know.

57:32.876 --> 57:34.584
But what's even more

57:32.876 --> 57:34.584
disturbing is the medicine

57:34.626 --> 57:37.751
was given to him while he

57:34.626 --> 57:37.751
was inside the hospital.

57:37.792 --> 57:39.334
- Well, how is that possible?

57:39.375 --> 57:41.500
- It isn't, in fact,

57:39.375 --> 57:41.500
something like this

57:41.542 --> 57:43.459
has never happened

57:41.542 --> 57:43.459
under my watch.

57:44.375 --> 57:45.792
Do you know anyone who may have

57:45.834 --> 57:48.167
given him something

57:45.834 --> 57:48.167
unintentionally?

57:49.375 --> 57:50.209
- No.

57:52.000 --> 57:53.626
I mean, our friend

57:52.000 --> 57:53.626
gave him a pudding

57:53.667 --> 57:56.292
from the nurse's

57:53.667 --> 57:56.292
station but that's it.

57:56.334 --> 57:59.834
- No, that wouldn't

57:56.334 --> 57:59.834
cause anything like this.

57:59.876 --> 58:01.459
You husband's out of the woods.

58:01.500 --> 58:03.876
But we're gonna continue

58:01.500 --> 58:03.876
to monitor him closely

58:03.918 --> 58:06.209
to make sure he makes

58:03.918 --> 58:06.209
a full recovery.

58:06.250 --> 58:07.626
- Thank you, Doctor.

58:06.250 --> 58:07.626
- Of course.

58:07.667 --> 58:11.542
We'll recheck all prescription

58:07.667 --> 58:11.542
refills on the list.

58:11.584 --> 58:14.792
It may take a while,

58:11.584 --> 58:14.792
but I promise you

58:14.834 --> 58:16.417
we'll get to the bottom of this.

58:28.667 --> 58:29.500
- [Jake] Naomi.

58:30.918 --> 58:32.083
- Hey.

58:30.918 --> 58:32.083
- Trooper.

58:33.250 --> 58:34.584
Abby told me I

58:33.250 --> 58:34.584
could find you here.

58:34.626 --> 58:36.542
- Have you heard from

58:34.626 --> 58:36.542
Scarlet this morning?

58:36.584 --> 58:38.083
- [Jake] No, why?

58:38.125 --> 58:41.375
- She's not responding to

58:38.125 --> 58:41.375
any of my calls or texts.

58:41.417 --> 58:43.375
- Hmm, that is not like her.

58:44.250 --> 58:45.584
When was the last time

58:44.250 --> 58:45.584
you talked to her?

58:45.626 --> 58:47.042
- Last night.

58:47.083 --> 58:50.083
She told me that you decided

58:47.083 --> 58:50.083
to not come from dinner.

58:50.125 --> 58:52.500
- Yeah, I changed my mind

58:52.542 --> 58:54.459
after talking with

58:52.542 --> 58:54.459
her on the way over.

58:55.918 --> 58:58.375
- Well, just so you know she

58:55.918 --> 58:58.375
seemed kind of hurt about it.

59:01.209 --> 59:05.417
- Let's just say, she was

59:01.209 --> 59:05.417
already a few glasses of wine in

59:05.459 --> 59:07.250
by the time I talked to her.

59:07.292 --> 59:10.125
I have lived long enough to

59:07.292 --> 59:10.125
know when to let a woman be.

59:12.125 --> 59:15.042
Honestly, I kind of suggested

59:15.083 --> 59:17.626
that we cool things

59:15.083 --> 59:17.626
off for a bit,

59:17.667 --> 59:18.834
and she did not want to.

59:19.751 --> 59:21.000
- I don't understand why.

59:22.125 --> 59:24.292
- Well, she opened

59:22.125 --> 59:24.292
up to me about

59:24.334 --> 59:27.250
feeling jealous

59:24.334 --> 59:27.250
of our closeness.

59:27.292 --> 59:28.167
- Yours and mine!

59:29.250 --> 59:30.751
We're just friends,

59:29.250 --> 59:30.751
we're costars.

59:30.792 --> 59:32.751
- Believe me that is what

59:30.792 --> 59:32.751
I tried to explain to her.

59:32.792 --> 59:35.584
The last thing I'd wanna do

59:32.792 --> 59:35.584
is interfere with the show.

59:36.500 --> 59:37.626
- Well, I don't know why she

59:37.667 --> 59:38.584
wouldn't have just come to me.

59:38.626 --> 59:40.042
We're so close.

59:40.083 --> 59:41.918
- Not everyone is

59:40.083 --> 59:41.918
like you, Naomi.

59:42.751 --> 59:45.083
I assumed she felt guilty

59:45.125 --> 59:47.375
and embarrassed for

59:45.125 --> 59:47.375
feeling that way,

59:47.417 --> 59:51.209
which is why I suggested

59:47.417 --> 59:51.209
we cool things off.

59:51.250 --> 59:53.375
I did call her after

59:51.250 --> 59:53.375
to check up on her,

59:53.417 --> 59:54.626
but it went to voicemail.

59:54.667 --> 59:56.083
I assume she passed out.

59:56.125 --> 59:57.959
Like I said she'd

59:56.125 --> 59:57.959
already had a few.

59:59.667 --> 01:00:01.375
Are you good to

59:59.667 --> 01:00:01.375
do the show today?

01:00:02.626 --> 01:00:04.083
- I mean, this would

01:00:02.626 --> 01:00:04.083
be the first show

01:00:04.125 --> 01:00:05.584
I've ever done without Scarlet,

01:00:05.626 --> 01:00:08.167
but we're doing a lot of

01:00:05.626 --> 01:00:08.167
firsts here lately, right.

01:00:08.209 --> 01:00:09.334
- [Jake] Always a pro.

01:00:11.709 --> 01:00:12.542
- Hey, Jake.

01:00:13.751 --> 01:00:15.459
You know, what you

01:00:13.751 --> 01:00:15.459
told me the other day

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.667
about Trent drinking.

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.667
- Yeah.

01:00:17.709 --> 01:00:20.000
- Well, his blood

01:00:17.709 --> 01:00:20.000
alcohol levels came back,

01:00:20.042 --> 01:00:22.417
and he was below

01:00:20.042 --> 01:00:22.417
the legal limit.

01:00:22.459 --> 01:00:24.000
- Oh.

01:00:24.042 --> 01:00:26.209
Well, I just assumed

01:00:24.042 --> 01:00:26.209
it was the beer.

01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:27.417
Like I say he took off so quick.

01:00:27.459 --> 01:00:28.834
I didn't have a

01:00:27.459 --> 01:00:28.834
chance to stop him.

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.709
I cannot imagine what

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.709
you are going through.

01:00:34.125 --> 01:00:36.083
- Yeah, you know what

01:00:34.125 --> 01:00:36.083
you go without me.

01:00:36.125 --> 01:00:38.125
I'm gonna check in

01:00:36.125 --> 01:00:38.125
with the glam squad.

01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:39.250
It's been a long day.

01:00:40.334 --> 01:00:41.083
- Okay.

01:00:53.584 --> 01:00:54.667
- [Man] Tony's Bar.

01:00:54.709 --> 01:00:56.042
- Hi, I was hoping

01:00:54.709 --> 01:00:56.042
you could help me.

01:00:56.083 --> 01:00:59.292
I am tying to see

01:00:56.083 --> 01:00:59.292
your security footage.

01:00:59.334 --> 01:01:01.042
How would I do that?

01:01:01.083 --> 01:01:02.959
- [Man] The police would

01:01:01.083 --> 01:01:02.959
have to request it.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.626
- Okay, so I report

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.626
it to police,

01:01:05.667 --> 01:01:07.209
and they could see the footage.

01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:08.042
- [Man] Exactly.

01:01:08.083 --> 01:01:09.167
- Got it, thank you.

01:01:09.209 --> 01:01:10.876
And that's our show.

01:01:10.918 --> 01:01:12.834
As always thank you

01:01:10.918 --> 01:01:12.834
for spending your

01:01:12.876 --> 01:01:16.125
- Mornings with.

01:01:12.876 --> 01:01:16.125
- Naomi and Jake.

01:01:16.167 --> 01:01:18.334
- See you tomorrow.

01:01:16.167 --> 01:01:18.334
- See you.

01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:20.542
- And we're out.

01:01:21.959 --> 01:01:23.834
Another great show team.

01:01:23.876 --> 01:01:25.584
These are your biggest fans.

01:01:25.626 --> 01:01:28.417
They won the Jake and

01:01:25.626 --> 01:01:28.417
Naomi trivia contest.

01:01:28.459 --> 01:01:29.876
- Still nothing from Scarlet?

01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:34.918
Thanks so much

01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:34.918
for watching guys.

01:01:37.626 --> 01:01:40.500
- Well, Jake is super

01:01:37.626 --> 01:01:40.500
excited to meet you guys.

01:01:40.542 --> 01:01:42.125
- Yes, thank you

01:01:40.542 --> 01:01:42.125
all for playing.

01:02:27.417 --> 01:02:29.626
- How come the arrest

01:02:27.417 --> 01:02:29.626
isn't on there?

01:02:29.667 --> 01:02:31.209
- There you are.

01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:32.959
I've been looking

01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:32.959
all over for you.

01:02:35.083 --> 01:02:36.417
- Scarlet's still not here.

01:02:37.667 --> 01:02:38.959
- [Jake] Where you off to?

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.459
- I was just gonna

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.459
check her place.

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.417
- Yeah, that's what I thought

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.417
too I'll meet you there.

01:02:42.459 --> 01:02:43.292
- Sure.

01:03:11.209 --> 01:03:12.792
Come on, Scarlet her car's here.

01:03:14.792 --> 01:03:15.626
It's locked.

01:03:16.876 --> 01:03:18.125
Scarlet!

01:03:16.876 --> 01:03:18.125
- Scarlet!

01:03:19.125 --> 01:03:20.500
- For times like these.

01:03:22.375 --> 01:03:23.792
Hey, I'm coming in.

01:03:36.375 --> 01:03:37.500
Scarlet!

01:03:36.375 --> 01:03:37.500
- Hello!

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.334
- Scarlet, where are you!

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.334
- Are you here!

01:03:45.334 --> 01:03:46.292
She has to be here.

01:03:46.334 --> 01:03:47.167
- Scarlet!

01:03:54.584 --> 01:03:55.417
Scarlet.

01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:58.167
Hello.

01:04:00.167 --> 01:04:01.167
- Yeah, like I said.

01:04:03.667 --> 01:04:04.500
- Scar.

01:04:06.918 --> 01:04:09.751
[Naomi screaming loudly]

01:04:09.792 --> 01:04:12.876
- Oh, my god, I'll

01:04:09.792 --> 01:04:12.876
call an ambulance.

01:04:16.584 --> 01:04:18.083
- It appears she

01:04:16.584 --> 01:04:18.083
drink too much wine

01:04:18.125 --> 01:04:19.667
and fell asleep in the tub.

01:04:19.709 --> 01:04:22.542
Unfortunately,

01:04:19.709 --> 01:04:22.542
it's not uncommon.

01:04:23.709 --> 01:04:25.375
We'll continue to

01:04:23.709 --> 01:04:25.375
look for foul play,

01:04:26.792 --> 01:04:31.042
and in the meantime, I'm

01:04:26.792 --> 01:04:31.042
very sorry for your loss.

01:04:38.417 --> 01:04:40.500
- I should've texted her back.

01:04:40.542 --> 01:04:42.000
I should've called her.

01:04:42.042 --> 01:04:44.292
I should've been there for her.

01:04:45.375 --> 01:04:47.542
- There was nothing

01:04:45.375 --> 01:04:47.542
you could do.

01:04:47.584 --> 01:04:48.792
You know what the

01:04:47.584 --> 01:04:48.792
detective said.

01:04:48.834 --> 01:04:51.918
It was a accident

01:04:48.834 --> 01:04:51.918
these things happen.

01:04:51.959 --> 01:04:53.918
- Not another accident.

01:05:10.167 --> 01:05:13.751
- Sometimes when things

01:05:10.167 --> 01:05:13.751
seem a little overwhelming,

01:05:14.626 --> 01:05:16.584
it's good to take a break.

01:05:17.751 --> 01:05:19.751
- What.

01:05:17.751 --> 01:05:19.751
- You know, just...

01:05:19.792 --> 01:05:20.834
get away from it all.

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.459
Would you like that?

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:25.792
- What are you talking about?

01:05:25.834 --> 01:05:28.000
- Would you like

01:05:25.834 --> 01:05:28.000
to go away with me?

01:05:29.876 --> 01:05:31.667
- Jake, you are not

01:05:29.876 --> 01:05:31.667
thinking clearly.

01:05:31.709 --> 01:05:33.584
- I am, I am.

01:05:33.626 --> 01:05:35.876
- No, you're emotional

01:05:33.626 --> 01:05:35.876
over Scarlet.

01:05:37.209 --> 01:05:39.667
- I could never

01:05:37.209 --> 01:05:39.667
be happy with her.

01:05:39.709 --> 01:05:40.542
- What, why?

01:05:43.125 --> 01:05:44.626
- Because I'm in love with you.

01:05:45.834 --> 01:05:47.334
- Okay, Jake, don't

01:05:45.834 --> 01:05:47.334
do this, all right.

01:05:47.375 --> 01:05:49.125
You are upset. You and Scarlet--

01:05:49.167 --> 01:05:50.751
- I don't care about Scarlet.

01:05:50.792 --> 01:05:52.334
- Don't do this.

01:05:50.792 --> 01:05:52.334
- I care about you.

01:05:52.375 --> 01:05:54.375
I am the only one who's

01:05:52.375 --> 01:05:54.375
been there for you, hmm?

01:05:56.876 --> 01:05:58.459
I'm the only one who's

01:05:56.876 --> 01:05:58.459
always been there for you,

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.000
always wanted

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.000
what's best for you.

01:06:00.042 --> 01:06:02.000
- You are the only

01:06:00.042 --> 01:06:02.000
one there for me

01:06:02.042 --> 01:06:04.500
because everyone in

01:06:02.042 --> 01:06:04.500
my life is either dead

01:06:04.542 --> 01:06:06.167
or almost been killed.

01:06:06.209 --> 01:06:08.667
And it all started to

01:06:06.209 --> 01:06:08.667
happen after you showed up.

01:06:10.709 --> 01:06:12.334
- What are you saying?

01:06:12.375 --> 01:06:14.000
Oh, you think I had

01:06:12.375 --> 01:06:14.000
something to do with all this?

01:06:14.042 --> 01:06:15.876
- I don't know what I'm

01:06:14.042 --> 01:06:15.876
saying...

01:06:15.918 --> 01:06:17.667
Okay? But those are the facts.

01:06:19.667 --> 01:06:20.500
I have to go.

01:06:21.417 --> 01:06:22.209
- Wait.

01:06:22.250 --> 01:06:23.083
Wait.

01:06:24.125 --> 01:06:24.918
I'm sorry.

01:06:26.667 --> 01:06:27.584
Forget what I said.

01:06:29.918 --> 01:06:31.209
I need you!

01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:32.709
[car engine revving]

01:06:32.751 --> 01:06:35.500
No, no, no, please,

01:06:32.751 --> 01:06:35.500
please, please.

01:06:35.542 --> 01:06:36.834
Don't go, don't go, no.

01:06:57.042 --> 01:06:58.042
- Abby.

01:06:58.083 --> 01:06:59.709
- So this woman named Lana Jones

01:06:59.751 --> 01:07:01.751
has been calling

01:06:59.751 --> 01:07:01.751
nonstop for Scarlet.

01:07:01.792 --> 01:07:04.250
Rambling on about how

01:07:01.792 --> 01:07:04.250
Scarlet's in danger.

01:07:04.292 --> 01:07:06.209
- I'm gonna need

01:07:04.292 --> 01:07:06.209
that number from you.

01:07:17.292 --> 01:07:18.125
Thank you.

01:07:24.292 --> 01:07:25.584
- Jake did it.

01:07:25.626 --> 01:07:27.250
He was with her last night.

01:07:27.292 --> 01:07:28.417
- What are you talking about?

01:07:28.459 --> 01:07:29.667
- Scarlet messaged me,

01:07:29.709 --> 01:07:31.918
and said Jake was

01:07:29.709 --> 01:07:31.918
with her last night.

01:07:31.959 --> 01:07:33.584
Apparently, she found

01:07:31.959 --> 01:07:33.584
something of his

01:07:33.626 --> 01:07:35.292
and wanted to hear my side.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.209
It seemed urgent.

01:07:38.250 --> 01:07:39.417
- Well, what did she find?

01:07:39.459 --> 01:07:40.626
- I don't know

01:07:39.459 --> 01:07:40.626
she couldn't talk.

01:07:40.667 --> 01:07:42.584
Like I said Jake was there.

01:07:42.626 --> 01:07:44.292
- Well, she told me

01:07:42.626 --> 01:07:44.292
that he texted her

01:07:44.334 --> 01:07:45.792
and decided not to come over.

01:07:49.292 --> 01:07:50.125
- Here.

01:07:55.751 --> 01:07:58.459
Must have been Jake who texted

01:07:55.751 --> 01:07:58.459
you after he killed her.

01:07:58.500 --> 01:07:59.959
- I know that you think,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.042
and always thought that he

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.042
killed Cole, but why Scarlet?

01:08:03.083 --> 01:08:05.626
- If I'm not mistaken, a

01:08:03.083 --> 01:08:05.626
strange string of events

01:08:05.667 --> 01:08:08.125
occurred after he

01:08:05.667 --> 01:08:08.125
showed up, right?

01:08:08.167 --> 01:08:09.751
- Yes.

01:08:08.167 --> 01:08:09.751
- And your cohost dies,

01:08:09.792 --> 01:08:12.626
and he's suddenly there

01:08:09.792 --> 01:08:12.626
to fill the position.

01:08:12.667 --> 01:08:14.125
And you husband.

01:08:12.667 --> 01:08:14.125
- My husband.

01:08:14.167 --> 01:08:15.584
- Exactly.

01:08:14.167 --> 01:08:15.584
- His accident.

01:08:17.292 --> 01:08:18.834
I guess, I just convinced myself

01:08:18.876 --> 01:08:20.917
that this was all coincidental.

01:08:20.959 --> 01:08:23.542
- Nothing with Jake Everett

01:08:20.959 --> 01:08:23.542
is ever coincidence.

01:08:25.876 --> 01:08:27.917
Naomi, you're in serious danger.

01:08:27.959 --> 01:08:29.417
We both are.

01:08:29.459 --> 01:08:31.375
Come with me to the police.

01:08:29.459 --> 01:08:31.375
I'm going there right now.

01:09:08.250 --> 01:09:10.917
[heavy gasping]

01:09:18.834 --> 01:09:19.792
No!

01:09:19.834 --> 01:09:20.667
No!

01:09:25.082 --> 01:09:26.167
- What, what.

01:09:27.334 --> 01:09:28.334
- She knows.

01:09:41.250 --> 01:09:42.125
- Mrs. Spinner.

01:09:44.082 --> 01:09:47.334
We found traces of Restophin

01:09:44.082 --> 01:09:47.334
in your husband's blood,

01:09:47.375 --> 01:09:50.334
which is commonly associated

01:09:47.375 --> 01:09:50.334
with a date rape drug.

01:09:50.375 --> 01:09:51.917
- A date rape drug.

01:09:51.959 --> 01:09:54.250
- That would explain

01:09:51.959 --> 01:09:54.250
the accident.

01:09:54.292 --> 01:09:57.209
- And the symptoms that he was

01:09:54.292 --> 01:09:57.209
having before the accident.

01:09:58.250 --> 01:09:59.417
- [Doctor] Do you know anyone

01:09:59.459 --> 01:10:00.542
who would wanna

01:09:59.459 --> 01:10:00.542
hurt your husband?

01:10:03.209 --> 01:10:04.584
- Excuse me, Dr. Maslow.

01:10:04.626 --> 01:10:06.209
They are really

01:10:04.626 --> 01:10:06.209
getting impatient.

01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:07.876
- I'll be back as soon as I can.

01:10:15.751 --> 01:10:17.209
- Hey, beautiful.

01:10:19.542 --> 01:10:22.375
- I made a mistake bringing

01:10:19.542 --> 01:10:22.375
Jake back into our lives.

01:10:25.083 --> 01:10:28.083
- Why would you say

01:10:25.083 --> 01:10:28.083
that about Jake?

01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:30.709
- I think, he was

01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:30.709
behind what happened

01:10:30.751 --> 01:10:34.167
to you and Robert and Scarlet.

01:10:39.167 --> 01:10:40.417
Call Lana Jones.

01:10:58.083 --> 01:10:59.542
Lana, I believe you.

01:10:59.584 --> 01:11:00.959
I'm on my way to the

01:10:59.584 --> 01:11:00.959
police station now.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.083
You're probably already there.

01:11:03.125 --> 01:11:04.000
I'll see you soon.

01:11:23.959 --> 01:11:25.584
See I told you.

01:11:25.626 --> 01:11:26.959
- Mrs. Spinner, I

01:11:25.626 --> 01:11:26.959
understand you think

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.417
Mr. Everett could be responsible

01:11:28.459 --> 01:11:29.584
for your husband's accident.

01:11:29.626 --> 01:11:30.918
- Not could be is.

01:11:30.959 --> 01:11:32.292
- Right, because he lied about

01:11:32.334 --> 01:11:33.959
helping your husband

01:11:32.334 --> 01:11:33.959
to his truck.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.167
Alright, that hardly implies

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.167
he attempted to kill him.

01:11:36.209 --> 01:11:38.167
- Jake was the last

01:11:36.209 --> 01:11:38.167
person with my husband.

01:11:38.209 --> 01:11:40.000
Jake ordered the drinks.

01:11:40.042 --> 01:11:41.500
- There's no footage at the bar

01:11:41.542 --> 01:11:43.167
that shows Jake

01:11:41.542 --> 01:11:43.167
drugging your husband.

01:11:43.209 --> 01:11:45.792
- That's because his

01:11:43.209 --> 01:11:45.792
back is to the camera.

01:11:45.834 --> 01:11:47.584
- [sighing] What

01:11:45.834 --> 01:11:47.584
about your husband?

01:11:49.918 --> 01:11:52.209
He still doesn't

01:11:49.918 --> 01:11:52.209
remember anything today?

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:56.292
- Well, no, but

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:56.292
the doctor did say

01:11:56.334 --> 01:11:59.125
it could be possible

01:11:56.334 --> 01:11:59.125
he'll start to get pieces.

01:11:59.167 --> 01:12:00.375
- Could.

01:12:00.417 --> 01:12:02.709
Look this is a very

01:12:00.417 --> 01:12:02.709
serious accusation.

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:04.209
I can't just file

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:04.209
charges against

01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:06.250
a man over your suspicion.

01:12:07.083 --> 01:12:08.375
We need actual evidence.

01:12:08.417 --> 01:12:09.876
I need proof.

01:12:09.918 --> 01:12:12.000
- That's exactly what you

01:12:09.918 --> 01:12:12.000
told Lana a few years ago.

01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:15.167
Did Lana Jones come

01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:15.167
in here earlier?

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:20.292
- No, Lana Jones

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:20.292
didn't come in today.

01:12:20.334 --> 01:12:21.167
- What.

01:12:22.042 --> 01:12:22.876
That can't be.

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:25.709
Are you sure?

01:12:25.751 --> 01:12:26.626
- I'm positive.

01:12:27.542 --> 01:12:28.918
Look, I'd like to help you.

01:12:28.959 --> 01:12:31.834
But at the moment my

01:12:28.959 --> 01:12:31.834
hands are tied, I'm sorry.

01:12:31.876 --> 01:12:33.125
- Of course, Detective.

01:12:36.584 --> 01:12:38.209
I'll handle the rest on my own.

01:13:52.125 --> 01:13:53.292
Oh, my god.

01:13:59.709 --> 01:14:00.876
- It's not just now.

01:14:02.042 --> 01:14:05.918
I have always loved you.

01:14:05.959 --> 01:14:07.834
I knew it from the

01:14:05.959 --> 01:14:07.834
first time I saw you.

01:14:07.876 --> 01:14:11.375
You were walking out of the

01:14:07.876 --> 01:14:11.375
library with your friends.

01:14:12.876 --> 01:14:14.584
I heard your laugh,

01:14:14.626 --> 01:14:16.667
and you looked at me.

01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:18.417
I couldn't believe you

01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:18.417
were looking at me.

01:14:18.459 --> 01:14:20.292
I just knew I had

01:14:18.459 --> 01:14:20.292
to be with you.

01:14:20.334 --> 01:14:22.083
- Why didn't you

01:14:20.334 --> 01:14:22.083
ever say anything?

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:23.417
- The show was going so well.

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:25.709
You and I were working

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:25.709
so perfectly together.

01:14:26.834 --> 01:14:28.209
I couldn't risk it, you know.

01:14:30.042 --> 01:14:31.709
You always were so

01:14:33.042 --> 01:14:35.751
interested in the athletes.

01:14:37.417 --> 01:14:39.834
I was just your friend,

01:14:39.876 --> 01:14:41.209
which I guess was right because

01:14:41.250 --> 01:14:43.792
when I finally did

01:14:41.250 --> 01:14:43.792
muster up the courage to

01:14:43.834 --> 01:14:48.792
spill my heart out,

01:14:43.834 --> 01:14:48.792
Cole stepped in,

01:14:48.834 --> 01:14:51.876
swept you off your

01:14:48.834 --> 01:14:51.876
feet so easily.

01:14:51.918 --> 01:14:55.959
I felt so betrayed,

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000
so hurt,

01:14:58.250 --> 01:14:59.250
so angry.

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:01.667
- So you killed him.

01:15:02.918 --> 01:15:04.626
- I couldn't control myself.

01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:09.459
I had never felt that way.

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:11.209
He had to pay.

01:15:11.250 --> 01:15:13.334
- And then you lied about it.

01:15:13.375 --> 01:15:16.250
And you let someone else

01:15:13.375 --> 01:15:16.250
take the blame for you.

01:15:16.292 --> 01:15:17.918
- I had to get away from you.

01:15:17.959 --> 01:15:19.876
It was the only way.

01:15:19.918 --> 01:15:22.209
- Jake, I never

01:15:19.918 --> 01:15:22.209
meant to hurt you.

01:15:23.584 --> 01:15:26.167
Obviously, the things I was

01:15:23.584 --> 01:15:26.167
feeling they were right.

01:15:26.209 --> 01:15:28.876
- I thought we'd

01:15:26.209 --> 01:15:28.876
be a team forever.

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:35.584
When, I left, I did everything

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:35.584
I could to try to just

01:15:35.626 --> 01:15:36.792
get you out of my head.

01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:40.375
When Lana tracked me down

01:15:41.709 --> 01:15:45.459
and I got fired, I

01:15:41.709 --> 01:15:45.459
knew that was a sign,

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:49.500
a sign that I had to get back

01:15:49.542 --> 01:15:53.876
to the thing that I

01:15:49.542 --> 01:15:53.876
lost 10 years ago, you.

01:15:54.751 --> 01:15:58.626
- So then you killed my costar,

01:16:00.417 --> 01:16:02.918
and then you went

01:16:00.417 --> 01:16:02.918
after my husband.

01:16:02.959 --> 01:16:05.125
How do you possibly think

01:16:05.167 --> 01:16:07.876
that I could love someone that

01:16:05.167 --> 01:16:07.876
could do something like that?

01:16:07.918 --> 01:16:12.918
- Because I'm doing this

01:16:07.918 --> 01:16:12.918
all for you, for us.

01:16:13.792 --> 01:16:16.042
We are supposed to be together.

01:16:16.083 --> 01:16:18.167
- That's never

01:16:16.083 --> 01:16:18.167
gonna happen, okay?

01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:21.209
It's not gonna happen.

01:16:21.250 --> 01:16:22.667
Now I'm gonna help you.

01:16:23.667 --> 01:16:26.292
Okay, I'm gonna help you.

01:16:26.334 --> 01:16:27.250
- Please don't do that.

01:16:27.292 --> 01:16:29.918
No, no, no, give me the phone.

01:16:29.959 --> 01:16:31.292
I said give me the phone!

01:16:31.334 --> 01:16:33.626
Give me the phone.

01:16:31.334 --> 01:16:33.626
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:16:33.667 --> 01:16:35.375
Okay, okay.

01:16:33.667 --> 01:16:35.375
- Come here.

01:16:35.417 --> 01:16:36.667
- No, no where are we going?

01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:38.834
- We are going

01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:38.834
somewhere very special

01:16:38.876 --> 01:16:41.667
where I know you will realize

01:16:38.876 --> 01:16:41.667
how you truly feel about me.

01:16:41.709 --> 01:16:43.667
- No, no Jake, please.

01:16:41.709 --> 01:16:43.667
- Oh, oh, hey, hey.

01:16:43.709 --> 01:16:45.542
Don't worry, don't worry, hey,

01:16:46.959 --> 01:16:49.042
I'm pretty sure it's gonna

01:16:46.959 --> 01:16:49.042
be our best show yet.

01:17:01.709 --> 01:17:02.626
- Hello.

01:17:02.667 --> 01:17:03.584
- Hey, sorry to bother you,

01:17:03.626 --> 01:17:04.834
but Naomi's not answering.

01:17:04.876 --> 01:17:05.834
Is she with you?

01:17:05.876 --> 01:17:07.459
- No.

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:08.834
No, I've been trying

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:08.834
to reach here too.

01:17:08.876 --> 01:17:10.834
She left here really upset.

01:17:10.876 --> 01:17:12.834
She's convinced that

01:17:10.876 --> 01:17:12.834
Jake is responsible

01:17:12.876 --> 01:17:15.125
for everything

01:17:12.876 --> 01:17:15.125
including my accident.

01:17:15.167 --> 01:17:17.876
- I know, she told me

01:17:15.167 --> 01:17:17.876
about the Restophin.

01:17:17.918 --> 01:17:19.209
- He lied, Abby.

01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:21.375
I remember him helping

01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:21.375
me get into the truck.

01:17:21.417 --> 01:17:22.709
- What.

01:17:21.417 --> 01:17:22.709
- Yes.

01:17:24.042 --> 01:17:25.167
Call the police right now

01:17:25.209 --> 01:17:26.584
and help me get out of here.

01:17:57.918 --> 01:17:59.709
- Still smells the

01:17:57.918 --> 01:17:59.709
same, doesn't it?

01:18:02.542 --> 01:18:05.417
You could almost taste those

01:18:02.542 --> 01:18:05.417
famous chicken nuggets.

01:18:05.459 --> 01:18:06.751
You sure did love those.

01:18:08.042 --> 01:18:10.000
Hey, Naomi, look.

01:18:10.042 --> 01:18:13.042
Look, that's our favorite

01:18:10.042 --> 01:18:13.042
booth right there.

01:18:14.459 --> 01:18:17.500
- Jake, whatever you're

01:18:14.459 --> 01:18:17.500
thinking it's not necessary.

01:18:17.542 --> 01:18:18.417
- Oh, it is.

01:18:18.459 --> 01:18:20.167
- No.

01:18:18.459 --> 01:18:20.167
- It is.

01:18:20.209 --> 01:18:24.042
I have waited 10

01:18:20.209 --> 01:18:24.042
years for this moment.

01:18:25.626 --> 01:18:29.709
And I have the perfect

01:18:25.626 --> 01:18:29.709
way to share it.

01:18:31.417 --> 01:18:33.292
With all our fans

01:18:31.417 --> 01:18:33.292
and loved ones.

01:18:34.792 --> 01:18:35.792
Look around.

01:18:39.709 --> 01:18:43.083
We're gonna livestream

01:18:39.709 --> 01:18:43.083
the whole thing

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.167
for everyone to see.

01:18:47.417 --> 01:18:48.584
You know, that really

01:18:47.417 --> 01:18:48.584
was a good idea

01:18:48.626 --> 01:18:52.584
by your former cohost

01:18:48.626 --> 01:18:52.584
Robert, wasn't it?

01:18:52.626 --> 01:18:53.792
- What are you talking about?

01:18:53.834 --> 01:18:56.584
- I may have borrowed

01:18:53.834 --> 01:18:56.584
his initial ideas,

01:18:56.626 --> 01:18:59.209
sort of made it my own.

01:18:59.250 --> 01:19:00.584
He really was pretty sharp.

01:19:01.792 --> 01:19:03.459
It's a shame what

01:19:01.792 --> 01:19:03.459
happened to him.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.083
No, no, no, hey, hey.

01:19:06.125 --> 01:19:07.584
No, no, no, no, no.

01:19:07.626 --> 01:19:09.709
No, no, no, no don't cry.

01:19:09.751 --> 01:19:12.375
Don't cry, don't

01:19:09.751 --> 01:19:12.375
cry, don't cry, hey.

01:19:12.417 --> 01:19:14.500
Hey, you're gonna mess

01:19:12.417 --> 01:19:14.500
up that pretty face.

01:19:17.834 --> 01:19:20.459
So what do you say?

01:19:21.751 --> 01:19:25.417
You ready to go

01:19:21.751 --> 01:19:25.417
live one last time?

01:19:27.334 --> 01:19:29.334
Okay, here we go.

01:19:31.792 --> 01:19:33.959
We'll wait till we

01:19:31.792 --> 01:19:33.959
have enough viewers.

01:19:35.375 --> 01:19:37.167
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

01:19:37.209 --> 01:19:39.959
- Jake.

01:19:37.209 --> 01:19:39.959
- 8,000, is that enough?

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.500
'Cause I want this to

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.500
go viral, you know.

01:19:42.542 --> 01:19:44.334
Okay, okay.

01:19:44.375 --> 01:19:46.459
Hi, welcome to a

01:19:44.375 --> 01:19:46.459
very special episode

01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:47.834
of Mornings with Naomi and Jake,

01:19:47.876 --> 01:19:50.167
in that, it will be

01:19:47.876 --> 01:19:50.167
our final episode.

01:19:50.209 --> 01:19:54.542
I'm standing here with your

01:19:50.209 --> 01:19:54.542
number one favorite, Naomi.

01:19:57.042 --> 01:20:01.083
Naomi, do you have an

01:19:57.042 --> 01:20:01.083
opening monologue for us?

01:20:01.125 --> 01:20:04.459
[soft sobbing]

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:05.626
That's not like you.

01:20:05.667 --> 01:20:07.167
You're never at

01:20:05.667 --> 01:20:07.167
the loss for words.

01:20:20.751 --> 01:20:22.209
- Trent.

01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:23.167
- Jake's got her.

01:20:24.334 --> 01:20:25.167
- I know.

01:20:28.834 --> 01:20:30.375
- What have you done?

01:20:30.417 --> 01:20:31.876
Why is she crying?

01:20:31.918 --> 01:20:33.292
I understand your concerns,

01:20:33.334 --> 01:20:36.167
but it will all be

01:20:33.334 --> 01:20:36.167
clear in just a moment.

01:20:39.417 --> 01:20:40.709
- Trent, if you're

01:20:39.417 --> 01:20:40.709
watching this,

01:20:40.751 --> 01:20:42.334
you are the love of my life.

01:20:44.584 --> 01:20:46.709
- This is not about Trent!

01:20:48.417 --> 01:20:51.542
This is about you and me.

01:20:54.417 --> 01:20:57.959
Truth is I fell

01:20:54.417 --> 01:20:57.959
in love with Naomi

01:20:59.125 --> 01:21:02.042
long before Trent

01:20:59.125 --> 01:21:02.042
or any of you did.

01:21:12.042 --> 01:21:14.042
Oh, where are you goin'?

01:21:23.042 --> 01:21:24.250
- I know where they are.

01:21:25.125 --> 01:21:26.876
Help me get out of here.

01:21:26.918 --> 01:21:27.751
- Okay, hold on.

01:21:36.459 --> 01:21:37.792
[soft chuckling]

01:21:37.834 --> 01:21:39.250
- Look at this.

01:21:41.250 --> 01:21:44.375
For all your Jacomi

01:21:41.250 --> 01:21:44.375
fans out there

01:21:44.417 --> 01:21:48.167
from our Campus Cool days

01:21:44.417 --> 01:21:48.167
where it all started.

01:21:52.918 --> 01:21:53.792
- Stop, stop, stop!

01:21:53.834 --> 01:21:54.834
- What?

01:21:53.834 --> 01:21:54.834
- No.

01:21:58.292 --> 01:22:02.083
- Tell the world what they

01:21:58.292 --> 01:22:02.083
all know, what I know.

01:22:06.125 --> 01:22:09.918
And we'll both run far, far away

01:22:09.959 --> 01:22:11.959
and live the life we

01:22:09.959 --> 01:22:11.959
always should have.

01:22:14.542 --> 01:22:17.667
- Okay, Jake, I do love you.

01:22:19.334 --> 01:22:20.834
And I was afraid to tell you.

01:22:20.876 --> 01:22:24.000
I was afraid that you

01:22:20.876 --> 01:22:24.000
didn't feel the same way.

01:22:27.959 --> 01:22:30.959
- Do you know how long I've

01:22:27.959 --> 01:22:30.959
wanted to hear you say that?

01:22:32.375 --> 01:22:33.209
- I do.

01:22:34.167 --> 01:22:36.000
And we can be together

01:22:37.209 --> 01:22:38.792
just please put the gun down.

01:22:45.375 --> 01:22:48.834
- The way you're

01:22:45.375 --> 01:22:48.834
looking at me right now

01:22:48.876 --> 01:22:50.959
that's the same way

01:22:48.876 --> 01:22:50.959
you were looking at me

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.709
the last time you betrayed me,

01:22:58.417 --> 01:23:00.334
the last time you

01:22:58.417 --> 01:23:00.334
will ever betray me.

01:23:01.375 --> 01:23:02.250
I'll see you soon.

01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:06.417
[heavy grunting]

01:23:12.167 --> 01:23:13.250
- No, no, no, no!

01:23:14.834 --> 01:23:17.667
[heavy breathing]

01:23:21.709 --> 01:23:22.584
- You okay?

01:23:23.584 --> 01:23:24.375
Are you?

01:23:24.417 --> 01:23:25.250
Are you okay?

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.167
- Hello, yes, this

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.167
is Trent Spinner.

01:23:31.209 --> 01:23:33.083
My wife is Naomi Spinner.

01:23:33.125 --> 01:23:35.000
I know where she's

01:23:33.125 --> 01:23:35.000
being held captive.

01:23:35.042 --> 01:23:36.626
She's at Johnny's Diner.

01:23:38.209 --> 01:23:40.876
[heavy gasping]

01:24:17.334 --> 01:24:18.292
- [Woman] Naomi!

01:24:17.334 --> 01:24:18.292
- [overlapping chatter]

01:24:18.334 --> 01:24:22.542
[Reporters, shouting, calling]

01:24:22.584 --> 01:24:25.459
- [Man 1] Are you okay?

01:24:22.584 --> 01:24:25.459
- [Man 2] Are you all right.

01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:26.792
- [Woman] Naomi!

01:24:26.834 --> 01:24:36.834
[overlapping chatter]

01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:56.000
[overlapping chatter continues]

01:25:11.542 --> 01:25:13.500
[audience applauding, cheering]

01:25:13.542 --> 01:25:16.083
- Welcome back, world.

01:25:16.125 --> 01:25:18.667
Okay, we hope you are

01:25:16.125 --> 01:25:18.667
wide awake right now

01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:21.167
because we do have people

01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:21.167
that watch overseas

01:25:21.209 --> 01:25:22.834
and we cover many time zones,

01:25:22.876 --> 01:25:24.250
but whatever time you're in

01:25:24.292 --> 01:25:26.500
it is everyone's favorite time.

01:25:26.542 --> 01:25:29.334
Time for our favorite

01:25:26.542 --> 01:25:29.334
most popular segment,

01:25:29.375 --> 01:25:32.834

01:25:32.876 --> 01:25:35.417
so here--

01:25:32.876 --> 01:25:35.417
- [audience gasping]

01:25:35.459 --> 01:25:37.334
Hi, what are you doing here?

01:25:37.375 --> 01:25:38.500
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:25:38.542 --> 01:25:40.209
- Hi, honey.

01:25:40.250 --> 01:25:42.292
What are you doing here?

01:25:42.334 --> 01:25:44.042
- Look, we're gonna get

01:25:42.334 --> 01:25:44.042
back to your segment.

01:25:44.083 --> 01:25:45.459
But before we do that,

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:46.959
I wanna share some

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:46.959
news with you that your

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.792

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.792
just shared with me.

01:25:49.834 --> 01:25:51.876
As of last week's ratings,

01:25:51.918 --> 01:25:54.709
you are the most watched

01:25:51.918 --> 01:25:54.709
daytime personality

01:25:54.751 --> 01:25:56.792
[baby crying]

01:25:54.751 --> 01:25:56.792
in the country.

01:25:56.834 --> 01:25:58.542
Congratulations, baby.

01:25:58.584 --> 01:26:00.417
- Thank you!

01:26:00.459 --> 01:26:02.292
- We love you, Naomi.

01:26:00.459 --> 01:26:02.292
- [Naomi] She's actually very

01:26:00.459 --> 01:26:02.292
happy about that.

01:26:02.334 --> 01:26:04.083
Oh my gosh, thank you!

01:26:08.167 --> 01:26:09.375
That is really huge news.

01:26:09.417 --> 01:26:11.042
I don't know what

01:26:09.417 --> 01:26:11.042
to say to that.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.459
Thank you.

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:16.334
Thank you to everyone

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:16.334
who watches the show

01:26:16.375 --> 01:26:19.834
and streams us around

01:26:16.375 --> 01:26:19.834
the world, worldwide.

01:26:19.876 --> 01:26:22.334
I'm sorry, it's

01:26:19.876 --> 01:26:22.334
taking me off guard.

01:26:22.375 --> 01:26:24.042
I'm so excited.

01:26:24.083 --> 01:26:25.876
It's truly an honor.

01:26:25.918 --> 01:26:27.167
And most importantly,

01:26:27.209 --> 01:26:29.375
I am thankful for you two,

01:26:29.417 --> 01:26:31.292
because you are

01:26:29.417 --> 01:26:31.292
my entire world.

01:26:32.209 --> 01:26:35.375
[audience applauding]

01:26:38.209 --> 01:26:40.584
[baby crying]

01:26:40.626 --> 01:26:42.751
Oh, it's okay, it's okay.
