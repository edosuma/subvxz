WEBVTT

00:51.176 --> 00:53.553
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED IN A DYSTOPIAN KOREA

00:53.636 --> 00:56.097
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

01:10.445 --> 01:13.114
-Judge Kang.
-My family's in there.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.993
-There's someone in there!
-Don't!

01:18.453 --> 01:19.454
Judge Kang!

01:20.205 --> 01:23.124
-Kang Yo-han!
-Don't!

01:23.208 --> 01:25.168
I'm only trying to give him a chance.

01:27.837 --> 01:28.963
-Don't…
-Please…

01:29.047 --> 01:30.590
-Don't!
-There are people in there.

01:30.673 --> 01:31.508
No!

01:37.847 --> 01:39.224
No…

01:51.194 --> 01:53.696
Honey! Help!

02:00.912 --> 02:02.163
Let go. Let go of me!

02:02.247 --> 02:04.165
Just calm down
and take a good look at him.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.129
My money…

02:09.838 --> 02:11.631
My money!

02:16.678 --> 02:18.388
My money!

02:20.306 --> 02:21.349
My money!

02:31.776 --> 02:34.320
What is it? This is fake money!

02:34.404 --> 02:35.655
This isn't my money.

02:36.990 --> 02:41.035
This isn't my money…

02:45.290 --> 02:47.417
-I need to save them!
-Calm down.

02:48.126 --> 02:49.794
Look at his bare face.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.554
This is…

02:59.637 --> 03:01.723
Honey, this is…

03:01.806 --> 03:05.101
He'd even deceived his family
telling them he had nothing left.

03:06.936 --> 03:09.355
Seo-jin.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.233
I really had no choice…

03:12.317 --> 03:14.944
Honey, let me explain.

03:17.697 --> 03:18.698
Hey!

03:22.452 --> 03:23.411
Don't go!

03:24.579 --> 03:25.872
Don't leave me!

03:31.169 --> 03:34.047
Here. If you want your revenge, go ahead.

03:34.130 --> 03:35.590
Don't hesitate.

03:42.263 --> 03:43.431
Please…

03:44.265 --> 03:50.021
I'm sorry. Please save my life…

04:02.700 --> 04:05.495
I'm sorry…
I deserve to die for what I did.

04:15.338 --> 04:19.592
My money… My money!

04:28.685 --> 04:30.603
He's our only bait
to catch Cha Gyeong-hui.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.773
Let's not make him go to waste.

05:15.690 --> 05:16.774
Having fun?

05:17.859 --> 05:20.320
Well… I don't know any other games.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.238
-You don't?
-No.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.533
-You have never played cards?
-With who?

05:26.367 --> 05:27.952
With family or…

05:29.495 --> 05:30.705
Or with friends.

05:33.207 --> 05:36.461
-Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
-Getting nosy again, are you?

05:37.128 --> 05:38.504
Don't rush to conclusions.

05:38.588 --> 05:41.257
I just don't like spending time
with others. That's all.

05:44.802 --> 05:45.928
Before that…

05:47.764 --> 05:49.015
Thank you

05:49.849 --> 05:52.894
-for helping me catch Do Young-choon.
-Save your thanks.

05:53.936 --> 05:55.897
We only just built the second story.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.607
Second story?

05:57.690 --> 06:00.943
First was Cha Gyeong-hui's secretary
and second was Do Young-choon.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.362
So we should now move on
to the next level.

06:03.446 --> 06:06.449
After Cha Gyeong-hui is
Heo Joong-se, is it?

06:06.532 --> 06:07.533
Where is the end?

06:08.701 --> 06:11.913
Well, it all depends
on the architecture of the house.

06:11.996 --> 06:15.625
But I'm the type who enjoys
toppling it all at once like this.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.089
You thought I'd really topple it, did you?

06:22.757 --> 06:25.802
Did you find anything about Jukchang TV?
I thought you were digging ferociously.

06:25.885 --> 06:29.555
Yes, the time when Jukchang TV
started assaulting people on the street

06:29.639 --> 06:34.143
happened when Heo Joong-se incited
his followers to take the streets.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.728
<i>We can't just rely on the police.</i>

06:35.812 --> 06:39.857
<i>We should be the owners of this country
and build a safe country by ourselves.</i>

06:39.941 --> 06:42.860
Tonight is the night
we become the real owners!

06:46.114 --> 06:47.031
What else?

06:48.157 --> 06:49.659
-Butler.
<i>-Yes, Master.</i>

06:50.409 --> 06:53.121
Can you play episode 86
of Heo Joong-se's private channel?

06:53.204 --> 06:54.622
It was aired on the second week of
September, four years ago.

06:54.705 --> 06:55.832
<i>Certainly, Master.</i>

06:56.916 --> 06:58.960
You two have become
best friends, haven't you?

07:00.837 --> 07:02.672
<i>The man to change Korea totally,</i>

07:02.755 --> 07:06.259
<i>Heo Joong-se! Yes, the man
to solve all your woes!</i>

07:06.342 --> 07:07.927
<i>Hello, I'm Do Youn-jeong.</i>

07:08.010 --> 07:09.262
<i>Hi!</i>

07:09.971 --> 07:12.765
<i>Dear my beloved and respected viewers,
I'm Heo Joong-se.</i>

07:12.849 --> 07:15.935
I'll tell you the real reason

07:16.018 --> 07:20.523
why you're living a pathetic life
as a jobless loser

07:20.606 --> 07:22.775
<i>and without ever dating</i>

07:22.859 --> 07:25.319
a pretty girl like I am now.

07:25.403 --> 07:27.989
It's because the higher-ups,
the ones with vested rights!

07:28.698 --> 07:31.284
It's all because they abandoned you.

07:31.951 --> 07:35.538
<i>Because they're currently
replacing all of you</i>

07:35.621 --> 07:40.585
<i>with foreign laborers
who are obedient and come in cheap.</i>

07:40.668 --> 07:43.796
<i>-Do you understand me?
-Do you understand?</i>

07:43.880 --> 07:47.508
<i>Now, I've mentioned
Mr. Seo Jeong-hak to you many times.</i>

07:47.592 --> 07:50.470
<i>-It costs 19,000 won.
-Make sure you have a read.</i>

07:50.553 --> 07:53.681
<i>Soon, we'll be a classless nation</i>

07:53.764 --> 07:56.309
<i>full of all kinds of mutts</i>

07:56.392 --> 07:59.520
<i>that have replaced us pure Koreans!</i>

07:59.604 --> 08:02.315
<i>You need to wake up, all right?</i>

08:02.398 --> 08:04.567
You need to rise up
with even your <i>jukchang</i>…

08:04.650 --> 08:07.778
You know <i>jukchang</i>, right?
It's the bamboo spears.

08:07.862 --> 08:11.115
What we need are groups like
The Patriotic Boys or The Patriotic Youth

08:11.199 --> 08:12.825
<i>and then protect the country.</i>

08:12.909 --> 08:16.829
<i>-An army!
-That's enough. Enough.</i>

08:16.913 --> 08:20.333
Boys, you should always listen
to what a beautiful lady tells you.

08:20.416 --> 08:21.542
Understand?

08:24.629 --> 08:28.925
Are you laughing because you know
my wife is a looker?

08:29.008 --> 08:31.677
<i>I knew you're a womanizer, you loser.</i>

08:31.761 --> 08:34.347
<i>Shine the camera on him.</i>

08:34.430 --> 08:35.806
<i>Show them the loser's face.</i>

08:37.391 --> 08:39.310
He was one of his production crew.

08:39.393 --> 08:43.147
It seems he was hired
after he ran Heo Joong-se's fan club.

08:43.231 --> 08:46.108
He even worked in Heo Joong-se's
presidential campaign.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.401
Interesting.

08:48.402 --> 08:51.364
Establish a national patriotic
youth organization?

08:51.447 --> 08:54.825
Heo Joong-se had wild dreams
from the start.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.455
How about we have him
stand before the court?

08:59.539 --> 09:01.499
Yes. I totally agree.

09:01.582 --> 09:04.126
Who knows what he'll do at this rate?

09:04.210 --> 09:06.170
It's not like it's a rebel group.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.792
It was quite amusing
how you got Kang Yo-han to model.

09:44.875 --> 09:47.169
Make sure he's not up to trouble,
Director Jung…

09:47.962 --> 09:50.715
I mean, Chairwoman Jung.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.342
Don't you worry.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.803
I'll keep a tight rein on him.

09:57.805 --> 10:00.933
Thanks to our fine model poking
around in our Dream Base project,

10:01.017 --> 10:02.518
we've wasted so much time.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.270
And it's costing us too.

10:04.353 --> 10:07.356
Let's just push for it now
without minding others.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.318
We'll gather up all the slumdogs
and the malcontents in Seoul,

10:10.401 --> 10:13.988
place them in a concentration camp
and turn it into reality TV.

10:14.071 --> 10:16.324
The title will be <i>Clean Korea!</i>

10:16.407 --> 10:19.160
We should lock up
all the illegal migrants too.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.747
There's nothing like it
for improving your approval ratings.

10:22.830 --> 10:26.125
Just you wait. I can't rely
on the police or the prosecution to do

10:26.208 --> 10:29.670
anything when they're waiting to
stab my back at any moment.

10:30.671 --> 10:33.299
I ought to breed
a more faithful and loyal organization

10:34.800 --> 10:36.844
and entrust them
with the responsibilities.

10:36.927 --> 10:39.639
And it's starting to come along.

10:39.722 --> 10:42.141
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH EDUCATION TF

10:46.937 --> 10:51.317
PRESIDENT PARK DU-MAN

10:57.823 --> 11:00.326
CONVERSATION REPORT TARGET: PARK DU-MAN

11:18.719 --> 11:21.639
How's the progress on Jung Seon-a's file?

11:22.681 --> 11:25.351
It hasn't been so easy
since it was some time ago.

11:25.434 --> 11:26.977
Put a stop to all else

11:27.061 --> 11:28.521
and have everyone work on it.

11:28.604 --> 11:31.941
-What are you doing? Move it.
-Yes, Minister.

11:32.024 --> 11:35.194
However, our team leader
does have a concern.

11:35.277 --> 11:36.237
What?

11:36.320 --> 11:39.323
Random assaults have been spreading
across the country recently.

11:40.282 --> 11:42.660
The victims were mostly
foreign workers and women…

11:42.743 --> 11:43.786
And?

11:44.578 --> 11:45.704
So what?

11:45.788 --> 11:49.959
Well, there are criticisms questioning
what the Ministry of Justice is doing.

11:51.001 --> 11:52.962
Did someone die?

11:53.045 --> 11:54.713
No that's not it.

11:54.797 --> 11:58.384
But the assaults took place publicly
in the streets and in broad daylight too.

11:58.467 --> 12:02.263
They run counter to the slogan,
"A Safe Korea."

12:04.807 --> 12:07.435
But that's Heo Joong-se's slogan.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.687
It was for his presidential campaign.

12:09.770 --> 12:11.689
Why should I mind it?

12:13.315 --> 12:14.775
I'm sorry, Minister.

12:16.944 --> 12:18.279
I'm sure that…

12:19.196 --> 12:21.699
Heo Joong-se thinks he can gain power

12:21.782 --> 12:24.535
by instigating immature adolescents
to instill fear,

12:25.578 --> 12:27.121
but he's making a big mistake.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.791
If he continues to let them be,
some will surely go too far.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.878
When we start to see death

12:33.961 --> 12:36.088
and the people's frustration
are at its zenith,

12:37.381 --> 12:38.883
that's when I'll strike.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.930
I, Cha Gyeong-hui,
the Minister of Justice,

12:46.056 --> 12:48.767
envisions a united Korea,
a nation of tolerance,

12:48.851 --> 12:53.355
as a Presidential candidate.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.192
Absolutely, Minister.

12:59.361 --> 13:01.405
So just focus on Jung Seon-a.

13:02.573 --> 13:05.159
We need to stomp down on her
before she grows any bigger.

13:05.743 --> 13:08.662
There's something about
Seo Jeong-hak's sudden death too.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.623
There's more to it than what we see.

13:10.706 --> 13:13.334
To that wench's grand scheme, I mean.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.003
Yes, Minister.

13:16.086 --> 13:18.839
-One more thing.
-Yes.

13:19.673 --> 13:21.967
You've been diligently checking
on him too, right?

13:22.968 --> 13:24.428
Who do you mean, exactly?

13:26.055 --> 13:27.806
Do Young-choon.

13:29.058 --> 13:32.269
Yes, I've been checking on him regularly.

13:32.353 --> 13:34.772
I'm sure he has money
stashed away somewhere.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.066
That weasel…

13:38.609 --> 13:40.861
He'll do anything for money.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.282
What are you doing?

13:45.366 --> 13:46.742
Go do your work.

13:46.825 --> 13:48.077
Yes, Minister.

13:59.129 --> 14:01.757
Today we're joined by
the woman of the moment,

14:01.840 --> 14:04.510
Judge Oh Jin-joo
of the Department of Live Court Show.

14:04.593 --> 14:07.388
-Hello, Judge Oh.
-Yes, hello.

14:07.471 --> 14:11.600
Judge Oh, you looked amazing
in your recent shoot.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.561
-Thank you.
-It's all the rage!

14:13.644 --> 14:16.772
People have been saying
you should be a movie star instead.

14:16.855 --> 14:18.774
Not everyone can be a movie star.

14:18.857 --> 14:21.944
Everyone, I was born
to be a civil servant.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.029
You're set until retirement too.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.406
Please, Judge Oh.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.534
Don't you find it tiring though?

14:28.617 --> 14:31.161
You have the eyes of
the nation on your work.

14:31.245 --> 14:32.454
It must be exhausting.

14:33.414 --> 14:37.710
No, how would I ever be tired
when so many people support me?

14:37.793 --> 14:39.420
-Really?
-Yes.

14:39.503 --> 14:42.715
We've been receiving
so many letters of support.

14:42.798 --> 14:44.592
-Would you like me to show you?
-Yes.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.387
Oh, so you've been keeping them?

14:48.470 --> 14:52.057
It gives me so much strength and joy
to see that there are many out there

14:52.141 --> 14:54.643
who trust and support me.

14:54.727 --> 14:58.772
We can see you truly mean it,
Judge Oh Jin-joo.

15:07.031 --> 15:09.283
All done.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.827
You were really great, Judge Oh.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.914
I always had it in me, you know.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.790
Anyway, you should have done
the interview too.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.918
I was kind of embarrassed
to do it on my own.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.420
I'm camera-shy, so…

15:21.503 --> 15:23.672
But that's not on!
We should be engaging more

15:23.756 --> 15:25.925
with our citizens in an era like this.

15:26.008 --> 15:28.469
In fact, this is the perfect timing
for our next trial.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.221
I wonder what Judge Kang is doing.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.935
-I have something to show you.
-What?

15:49.073 --> 15:51.033
Are they crazy?

15:51.116 --> 15:52.368
Oh no…

15:53.661 --> 15:55.496
What are the police doing?
They should arrest them!

15:58.499 --> 16:00.000
<i>Nice!</i>

16:00.084 --> 16:02.461
<i>Busan, you've still got it!</i>

16:02.544 --> 16:05.047
-Hold on.
<i>-You'll help me, right?</i>

16:05.631 --> 16:07.049
<i>We are…</i>

16:07.883 --> 16:09.468
<i>the power!</i>

16:15.599 --> 16:16.642
Shall we…

16:18.644 --> 16:21.313
-have them stand before the court?
-For our show?

16:23.107 --> 16:26.235
Judge Oh has given us her consensus too.
But we have a problem.

16:26.318 --> 16:28.445
How will we catch them
and drag them into court

16:28.529 --> 16:30.572
when they're under
the police's protection?

16:31.615 --> 16:34.952
You're right. They need to be
first indicted to face trial.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.914
But I'm not sure whether
that would be possible

16:38.998 --> 16:41.375
because the President has their back.

16:41.458 --> 16:45.546
There is someone who will be
most willing to help us with this one.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.047
Who are you talking about?

16:47.923 --> 16:50.718
Someone who won't be able to stand
watching Heo Joong-se

16:50.801 --> 16:52.469
have his way more than anyone else.

16:53.387 --> 16:54.638
Cha Gyeong-hui?

16:56.098 --> 16:59.101
Still, do you think she will help you?

16:59.184 --> 17:01.061
Of course she won't.

17:01.145 --> 17:05.274
That's why Mr. Go will use his connections
in the Prosecution to leak it to her.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.609
That Jukchang hooligans are
Heo Joong-se's private organization.

17:08.652 --> 17:11.530
If they can bring them in,
it won't be a problem indicting them.

17:12.197 --> 17:14.908
Still, I bet they'll be reluctant to
arrest them themselves.

17:16.035 --> 17:19.621
There is one person.
A police officer who may be able to do it.

17:20.414 --> 17:21.498
Police officer?

17:22.916 --> 17:24.126
Are you talking about Su-hyeon?

17:25.419 --> 17:29.131
She'll have to do this on her own
since the Commissioner has their back too.

17:29.798 --> 17:30.841
Not Su-hyeon, never.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.427
Something tells me
she's already on the move.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.144
<i>Okay, that was Busan.</i>

17:42.227 --> 17:44.688
<i>We've done Busan, Daegu, and…</i>

17:45.481 --> 17:46.940
<i>so where is next?</i>

17:47.024 --> 17:48.150
<i>Daejeon.</i>

17:48.817 --> 17:50.110
<i>What are you doing, Daejeon?</i>

17:50.194 --> 17:52.237
<i>Aren't you going to show us
your patriotism?</i>

17:52.321 --> 17:54.114
<i>You can't lose to them!</i>

17:55.074 --> 17:57.284
<i>I know what fine patriots you…</i>

17:57.367 --> 17:59.661
-What's on your mind?
-Geez.

18:00.996 --> 18:02.956
When did you come in?

18:03.040 --> 18:05.000
You're planning to catch him, are you?

18:05.084 --> 18:06.168
Well…

18:10.672 --> 18:12.591
Yes, you're right.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.136
Ever since he got caught last time,

18:16.220 --> 18:18.430
he's been broadcasting shows
all on his own in hiding.

18:20.557 --> 18:22.142
Then we'll have to track him down.

18:22.226 --> 18:24.520
-Do you need my help?
-You?

18:28.482 --> 18:29.733
Give it to me.

18:30.651 --> 18:31.902
For real?

18:34.029 --> 18:35.072
Here.

18:38.992 --> 18:42.579
All right. I bet it won't be so easy, but…

18:43.872 --> 18:44.832
First…

18:50.254 --> 18:52.214
It's heavily secured as I expected.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.133
Wow, this is something else.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.051
So you are a computer science major.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.432
SU-HYEON

19:04.810 --> 19:05.894
One moment.

19:11.191 --> 19:12.109
Hey, Su-hyeon.

19:12.192 --> 19:15.028
Hey, Ga-on.
Aren't you coming home these days?

19:15.696 --> 19:18.949
No, there's something I have to do.

19:19.032 --> 19:20.409
Before that, are you okay?

19:20.492 --> 19:24.329
<i>Jukchang maliciously edited
and uploaded that video of yours.</i>

19:24.413 --> 19:27.541
Don't get me started.
I had to turn in my gun because of him.

19:27.624 --> 19:29.585
<i>We really need to catch
that bastard quick,</i>

19:29.668 --> 19:31.170
<i>but the higher-ups won't budge.</i>

19:31.253 --> 19:33.088
<i>So I can't even ask
the Cyber Police for help.</i>

19:34.965 --> 19:38.594
If I don't jump in to stop him,
who knows how far that bastard will go.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.150
You're already on it?

19:54.026 --> 19:56.195
Oh, I'm playing a game.

19:56.278 --> 19:57.571
-Game?
-Yes.

19:58.488 --> 20:00.824
Don't tell me you think

20:00.908 --> 20:05.078
hacking involves typing away
at your computer all day.

20:05.162 --> 20:06.955
Gosh, computer illiterates…

20:08.332 --> 20:13.003
I'm running a program
in the background, so just wait.

20:14.171 --> 20:16.632
It'll take some time.

20:16.715 --> 20:19.885
Maybe a day, or maybe a week.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.141
Thanks, Elijah.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.984
What is it?

20:36.068 --> 20:39.780
This idiot clicked on a link
I included in my comments.

20:39.863 --> 20:42.908
Who knew he'd fall for
something as simple as this?

20:44.159 --> 20:45.202
What was it?

20:46.995 --> 20:49.957
-A picture of a female K-Pop idol.
-K-Pop idol?

20:51.750 --> 20:52.876
<i>Hey, Ga-on.</i>

20:55.337 --> 20:58.090
What? You have Jukchang's location?

20:58.173 --> 21:00.050
Where is he? Let me head there now.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.010
Su-hyeon, let's keep calm

21:02.094 --> 21:05.097
and ask for an official investigation.
It's dangerous on your own.

21:05.180 --> 21:07.307
<i>It's no use. No one will help.</i>

21:07.391 --> 21:10.018
<i>Besides, this is just catching one loser.</i>

21:10.102 --> 21:11.812
It's dangerous on your won.
You don't even have a gun.

21:11.895 --> 21:14.189
Whatever. Just send me the address.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.566
I'm serious, all right?

21:16.650 --> 21:18.860
<i>-Send me the address.</i>
-Su-hyeon…

21:28.954 --> 21:32.541
SUSPECTED TO HAVE MURDERED SEO JEONG-HAK…

21:32.624 --> 21:34.084
We have a story…

21:36.336 --> 21:37.838
but there's not enough evidence.

21:41.091 --> 21:43.427
I need at least a few more
circumstantial evidence

21:43.510 --> 21:46.263
if I wanted to topple her with one blow.

21:49.725 --> 21:51.727
-Minister Cha.
-What is it?

21:51.810 --> 21:54.521
The Foundation cut our budget
for the Ministry of Justice.

21:54.604 --> 21:55.522
What?

21:55.605 --> 21:58.191
It was a unilateral notice
without negotiations

21:58.275 --> 22:00.861
and we will be short on funds
for our shadow organization.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.663
That wench…

22:18.837 --> 22:20.464
Minister Cha, you can't just…

22:28.597 --> 22:31.433
I'm sorry, Chairwoman.
I couldn't stop her barging in.

22:35.604 --> 22:38.023
It's okay. I had a good sleep.

22:38.106 --> 22:41.610
And don't do that next time.
She serves this country.

22:46.323 --> 22:47.699
Long time no see.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.081
Has it been a long time?

22:55.290 --> 22:57.751
I admit I have been ignorant, haven't I?

22:58.335 --> 22:59.586
But please do forgive me.

23:00.295 --> 23:02.714
It's not easy being a chairwoman.

23:02.798 --> 23:04.883
Why did you cut the budget?

23:06.551 --> 23:08.929
So that's why you're here.

23:09.012 --> 23:11.098
You must have been very disappointed.

23:11.181 --> 23:12.557
But please do understand.

23:12.641 --> 23:14.893
There are so many places
that need our support,

23:14.976 --> 23:18.355
but our donations are down
since people have become ungenerous.

23:18.438 --> 23:20.732
But you increased your budget
for the Blue House.

23:23.693 --> 23:24.778
I see.

23:27.405 --> 23:30.951
That was a decision by our staff
and I can't remember every single detail.

23:31.034 --> 23:32.702
Shall I help you remember, then?

23:36.289 --> 23:38.458
Don't you smell something fishy?

23:41.169 --> 23:42.420
What, exactly?

23:45.257 --> 23:49.261
For some reason,
I'm smelling blood around you.

23:49.344 --> 23:51.096
I wonder why is that so.

23:52.639 --> 23:54.432
I'm not sure what you mean.

23:55.684 --> 23:58.937
How long has it been again
since Chairman Seo took his own life?

23:59.020 --> 24:00.105
Oh dear.

24:01.648 --> 24:03.984
Did I rub salt into your wound?

24:04.067 --> 24:05.485
If I did, I apologize.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.112
You did serve him for a long time.

24:07.195 --> 24:09.990
You must still be grieving and in pain.

24:12.367 --> 24:15.495
What is it that you want to say, Minister?

24:15.579 --> 24:18.248
When you're in my seat,

24:18.915 --> 24:21.835
you come to hear all sorts.

24:21.918 --> 24:23.461
For example?

24:23.545 --> 24:27.549
A power figure who was greatly respected
by our citizens took his own life.

24:27.632 --> 24:32.637
So why did they hurriedly cremate him
instead of holding a national funeral?

24:32.721 --> 24:36.933
And why had he left his will on his PC
instead of in his own handwriting?

24:37.642 --> 24:40.228
He'd always write
with a brush and ink too.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.981
Do you have much free time
on your hands these days?

24:43.064 --> 24:44.566
Would you like more work?

24:44.649 --> 24:45.734
What?

24:45.817 --> 24:48.987
Come back with more definitive evidence.

24:50.864 --> 24:54.326
I'm sorry, but I'm a little busy
with our state affairs.

24:55.076 --> 24:56.912
-Jae-hee?
-Yes.

24:57.996 --> 24:59.581
Our guest will be leaving now.

25:05.295 --> 25:08.131
Oh, and one more thing, Minister.

25:08.924 --> 25:10.300
I'm really sorry,

25:10.383 --> 25:14.346
but your vehicle is costing us
an awful lot in terms of gas.

25:14.429 --> 25:16.806
Since our country
isn't in a good financial shape,

25:16.890 --> 25:20.185
you won't mind if we switch it
with something smaller, will you?

25:20.268 --> 25:22.520
Our people will be touched

25:22.604 --> 25:27.692
to see that our leaders
of this country are surely different.

25:28.610 --> 25:29.861
You've completely lost it.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.005
What the hell are you doing?

25:49.089 --> 25:51.675
Why is it taking so long to secure
evidence against Jung Seon-a?

25:51.758 --> 25:54.344
I'm sorry, Minister.
Please give us some more time.

25:54.427 --> 25:57.681
You incompetent imbeciles!

26:01.559 --> 26:03.478
I should go see Kang Yo-han.

26:03.561 --> 26:05.730
Pardon? Did you say Kang Yo-han?

26:06.356 --> 26:08.233
What is this? Why are you so startled?

26:09.276 --> 26:11.695
I didn't expect you to mention his name.

26:11.778 --> 26:14.906
His name appears on her file
that she used to be his maid.

26:17.659 --> 26:21.204
I'm sure Kang Yo-han knows something.
A clue to track down that wench's past.

26:22.163 --> 26:25.667
Get me an appointment with him.
And find a quiet place.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.294
Yes, Minister.

26:35.427 --> 26:36.886
Are you sure this is the place?

26:38.096 --> 26:39.597
How did you find out anyway?

26:44.352 --> 26:46.354
Most of all, why are you here?

26:46.438 --> 26:48.940
Just in case you'll be bored on your own.

26:49.024 --> 26:51.318
Were you that worried
about sending me off alone?

26:53.069 --> 26:54.612
Yes, I was worried.

26:54.696 --> 26:56.948
-What?
-Not about you, but Jukchang.

26:57.032 --> 26:59.701
I was worried you'll beat him
half to death like last time.

27:07.250 --> 27:09.085
It's an electronic rolling shutter.

27:11.171 --> 27:13.048
It looks like this is the only way in.

27:16.634 --> 27:18.636
-Hey, Elijah.
-Elijah?

27:19.929 --> 27:22.474
Yes, the shutters are down.

27:24.517 --> 27:25.727
Yes, all right.

27:26.644 --> 27:27.771
Why did she call you?

27:27.854 --> 27:30.273
It was Elijah who tracked down
his IP to this address.

27:31.524 --> 27:32.859
Really?

27:33.693 --> 27:36.196
She's a genius who was admitted to
the College of Computer Science

27:36.279 --> 27:37.781
at Stanford at a young age.

27:38.448 --> 27:40.992
Amazing.

27:42.118 --> 27:43.953
Still, I don't think she can open this.

27:44.788 --> 27:46.206
Let's look for another way in.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.126
Be careful.

27:55.757 --> 27:57.675
24-HOUR
KU BUILDING SECURITY

28:06.434 --> 28:09.354
-Su-hyeon, come up.
-Why?

28:09.437 --> 28:10.855
-It's open.
-What?

28:19.280 --> 28:20.407
Hey, Elijah.

28:22.158 --> 28:25.328
You're truly amazing.
How did you even hack into this?

28:25.912 --> 28:29.165
Whatever. Just be careful. Both of you.

28:29.249 --> 28:30.834
Thanks.

28:35.922 --> 28:39.008
Hacking?
Honestly, those computer illiterates…

KU SECURITY
NUMBER: 010 0178 1905

28:58.278 --> 28:59.279

29:13.877 --> 29:15.295
<i>Hello?</i>

29:15.378 --> 29:18.089
<i>I'm at Jinheung Building right now.</i>

29:18.173 --> 29:20.383
<i>Really? At this hour?</i>

29:20.467 --> 29:23.553
I attend the First Cram School
in this building

29:23.636 --> 29:26.222
<i>and I'd stayed back late
to study for my exam…</i>

29:26.306 --> 29:29.559
Mister, I'm really scared.

29:29.642 --> 29:30.727
What do I do?

29:30.810 --> 29:32.812
<i>Don't worry, I'll open it up.</i>

29:32.896 --> 29:36.649
Really? Thank you so much. Thank you!

29:55.710 --> 29:58.797
Do you think we'll be okay?
What if there are guards?

29:59.464 --> 30:02.967
You think a loser who hides behind
the monitor has bodyguards?

30:03.051 --> 30:05.345
It's only a tiny private channel…

30:08.181 --> 30:09.891
CHANG'S DEBATING CLASS

30:33.206 --> 30:34.624
Why wouldn't you pick up?

30:45.218 --> 30:47.804
Don't lie to me.
It's been more than 40 minutes already!

30:47.887 --> 30:49.764
I'm starving, all right?

30:50.682 --> 30:51.766
Where are you now?

30:52.559 --> 30:53.768
I'll go get my <i>jjamppong</i>.

30:56.312 --> 30:57.605
Hello.

30:58.439 --> 30:59.732
Hey, it's been a long time.

31:00.608 --> 31:02.068
It's been a long time.

31:07.782 --> 31:08.825
Are you here on your own?

31:13.079 --> 31:14.247
Let go!

31:18.209 --> 31:20.587
That hurts!

31:23.506 --> 31:24.507
Let's go.

31:26.384 --> 31:27.886
I'll come with you, all right?

31:30.179 --> 31:31.890
Hey, what took you so long?

31:32.473 --> 31:33.391
Hey.

31:34.100 --> 31:37.020
-Go back.
-That hurts!

31:37.103 --> 31:38.438
Hey!

31:52.243 --> 31:53.411
Are you all right?

31:58.207 --> 31:59.500
Go see who that is.

32:26.152 --> 32:27.111
Kang Yo-han?

32:28.279 --> 32:29.822
You go get Jukchang.

32:36.746 --> 32:38.623
Now the numbers are even, right?

34:34.489 --> 34:35.740
Damn it.

34:38.284 --> 34:40.453
Now we're really getting started,
you loser!

34:45.792 --> 34:47.335
Hello there!

34:48.503 --> 34:52.965
Wow, educating our youth on law?
That's very admirable.

34:53.049 --> 34:54.759
Never mind me. Keep going.

34:54.842 --> 34:57.845
It's okay. Just keep working.

34:57.929 --> 35:01.307
But if there's anything interesting,
show me too.

35:01.891 --> 35:03.142
Minbo Group?

35:04.143 --> 35:06.354
Great sound!

35:06.437 --> 35:09.065
I can even hear
President Min Yong-sik breathing.

35:11.234 --> 35:13.111
What the hell are you doing here?

35:17.865 --> 35:22.078
Is this Team Inwang-dong,
that's more brilliant than the NIS?

35:22.161 --> 35:23.329
Let's talk inside.

35:24.163 --> 35:26.124
Why not just discuss it here?

35:26.207 --> 35:27.750
We're all one team.

35:28.835 --> 35:31.087
How did you even find out
about this place?

35:31.170 --> 35:34.632
I have much interest in
youth and legal education, you see.

35:34.715 --> 35:36.676
Whatever, just get to the point.

35:38.219 --> 35:40.388
How do you know Jung Seon-a?

35:40.471 --> 35:42.598
Well, I'm not sure
what you're talking about.

35:42.682 --> 35:45.476
I heard she once worked
for your family as a maid.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.770
-Is this true?
-Well…

35:47.854 --> 35:50.314
I shouldn't really talk about
other people's private matters.

35:50.398 --> 35:53.526
There are even rumors that
she even killed her own parents.

35:55.528 --> 35:57.864
Really? What a surprise.

35:58.573 --> 36:02.368
Your face says,
"I can't give it to you for free."

36:02.451 --> 36:04.537
What is it that you want?

36:05.913 --> 36:07.123
Jukchang.

36:07.957 --> 36:09.167
Jukchang?

36:09.250 --> 36:11.752
Cooperate with us on his trial.

36:11.836 --> 36:15.548
All you need to do is indict him
and sit back and watch.

36:15.631 --> 36:18.759
-The Prosecution, that is.
-Heo Joong-se will have a fit.

36:18.843 --> 36:22.513
Why are you being so narrow-minded?
It'll be me dealing with him anyway.

36:27.768 --> 36:28.895
All right.

36:29.979 --> 36:31.105
Thank you.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.067
And…

36:43.326 --> 36:45.328
I found this on my way here.

36:47.330 --> 36:50.625
Should I give it to you? Or to him?

36:59.592 --> 37:02.136
CASE REPORT ON UNNATURAL DEATH

37:03.346 --> 37:06.307
AFFIDAVIT

37:06.390 --> 37:09.185
AUTOPSY REPORT

37:15.233 --> 37:17.818
An online broadcaster…

37:19.946 --> 37:24.492
Isn't that rather dull
for the <i>Live Court Show</i>?

37:25.451 --> 37:28.204
He's been instigating violence
and causing social agitation.

37:29.038 --> 37:31.290
Wouldn't the Blue House like it too?

37:31.374 --> 37:34.460
It goes in line with the President's
strengthened policies

37:34.543 --> 37:36.003
on law and order.

37:37.213 --> 37:38.756
You do have a point.

37:41.467 --> 37:44.387
All right. You have my full approval!

37:49.058 --> 37:51.435
-How did it go?
-Accepted.

37:52.395 --> 37:54.814
Then let me map out the plan on this one.

37:54.897 --> 37:56.190
You?

37:56.274 --> 37:59.110
It's me who knows guys like Jukchang best.

38:08.911 --> 38:11.330
This is a blatant challenge to

38:11.414 --> 38:14.583
our honorable, respectable citizens!

38:14.667 --> 38:17.670
How could they put
a patriotic youth to trial?

38:17.753 --> 38:21.257
He plucked up the courage
to defend his nation!

38:21.340 --> 38:24.510
Are judges that great?
Do they think they sit above the law?

38:24.593 --> 38:29.348
This is clearly a coup! A coup d'etat!

38:31.017 --> 38:32.810
That's not how it's supposed to be…

38:32.893 --> 38:36.397
Anyway, all this was born
out of his pure patriotism

38:36.480 --> 38:40.109
to defend this country. Was it not?

38:40.192 --> 38:42.862
I will keep a close watch
on this trial to the end

38:42.945 --> 38:47.325
on whether the proceedings
are just and fair!

38:50.786 --> 38:52.455
Damn it.

38:53.414 --> 38:56.000
Kang Yo-han! I'll rip him to pieces!

38:57.209 --> 38:58.627
This is driving me crazy.

38:59.295 --> 39:00.379
Look, Mr. Lawyer.

39:01.297 --> 39:03.341
I'm a political offender.

39:03.424 --> 39:04.842
A revolutionary.

39:04.925 --> 39:07.845
I'm not like
your petty criminals, all right?

39:08.554 --> 39:11.640
Then should I not submit evidence
for extenuating circumstances?

39:11.724 --> 39:13.351
For example, your unfortunate upbringing?

39:15.269 --> 39:16.312
Hold on.

39:18.564 --> 39:21.484
Wouldn't it be in my favor
to publish that at least?

39:21.567 --> 39:23.903
Submit that for now with all the details.

39:24.487 --> 39:25.696
All right.

39:28.616 --> 39:30.576
Since we're on the topic,

39:30.659 --> 39:33.621
Kang Yo-han and some young judge

39:33.704 --> 39:36.582
swung their wooden bats
and threatened me in my face.

39:38.542 --> 39:40.753
How about we use that against them?

39:41.754 --> 39:45.966
You'll need a doctor's certificate
if you wish to claim insanity.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.676
But I saw them!

39:47.760 --> 39:49.804
You think I'm lying to you?

39:49.887 --> 39:51.138
Oh, really?

39:53.224 --> 39:55.684
Then can you tell me
all the names of the people

39:55.768 --> 39:57.978
that witnessed the scene?

39:58.062 --> 39:59.522
We'll need objective evidence.

40:02.316 --> 40:03.359
Forget it.

40:04.026 --> 40:05.277
I was there all alone.

40:08.197 --> 40:10.699
Before that, are you sure
you're confident about this?

40:12.827 --> 40:14.870
I can't end up in prison, you know.

40:16.622 --> 40:18.124
Yes, don't you worry.

40:19.083 --> 40:21.627
I'll make sure you're released
with a stay of execution.

40:31.470 --> 40:33.431
The effort you go to!

40:33.514 --> 40:36.225
You take care of all those plants here,
and sensitive girl and a weird man

40:36.308 --> 40:37.643
at that weird mansion.

40:37.726 --> 40:40.729
I'm just as weird as he is.

40:40.813 --> 40:42.857
Right. You have been weird these days.

40:43.983 --> 40:46.652
What is it?
Did the Professor say something?

40:46.735 --> 40:47.945
What about him?

40:48.028 --> 40:50.906
I haven't seen him
ever since I saw him here last time.

40:50.990 --> 40:52.074
Oh, really?

40:52.158 --> 40:53.993
I thought he'd been nagging you again.

40:57.872 --> 41:00.374
You show up at the station
and asked me what I would do

41:00.458 --> 41:03.085
if you were to do something bad,
and then Kang Yo-han showed up

41:03.169 --> 41:05.463
when we were off to catch Jukchang.

41:05.546 --> 41:07.673
Have you been up to no good these days?

41:08.466 --> 41:09.508
Does it look like it?

41:11.093 --> 41:12.928
Well… I'm just asking.

41:13.012 --> 41:15.431
I'm just jealous. That's all.

41:15.514 --> 41:19.810
It's weird seeing my best friend
hang out with some billionaire.

41:19.894 --> 41:22.062
It's like you're now
in a whole different world.

41:23.481 --> 41:24.815
I see.

41:27.276 --> 41:29.195
But he's not rich.

41:29.278 --> 41:30.946
Once you get to know him,

41:31.614 --> 41:33.407
you'll see that he's a poor man.

41:37.995 --> 41:39.330
I'm way richer, you know.

41:40.414 --> 41:43.501
I have good memories with Mom and Dad,

41:45.377 --> 41:48.214
and this house that I've been cherishing.

41:48.297 --> 41:49.381
And…

41:58.891 --> 42:00.601
I even have a fan club, don't I?

42:00.684 --> 42:02.102
"Ga-on, I reject it!"

42:08.526 --> 42:10.402
I'm leaving.

42:10.486 --> 42:12.988
-You're leaving already?
-I'm busy.

42:13.072 --> 42:15.658
You think police officers are free?

42:16.951 --> 42:18.160
Take care.

42:45.479 --> 42:47.022
And I have you,

42:48.107 --> 42:49.275
Su-hyeon.

42:58.659 --> 43:00.661
Hello, Young Master.

43:14.258 --> 43:16.552
I know you're the chairwoman
of our support group,

43:16.635 --> 43:19.096
but don't you think
you're barging in here too often?

43:19.179 --> 43:21.473
So why do you keep making me
want to barge in here?

43:21.557 --> 43:24.602
Are you doing that on purpose
because you miss me?

43:29.690 --> 43:30.816
What's your business?

43:31.984 --> 43:33.277
The <i>Live Court Show</i>.

43:33.360 --> 43:36.280
Why did you pick such a scandalous case?

43:36.363 --> 43:39.116
He's not a politician
nor is he a privileged one.

43:39.199 --> 43:40.868
So what's there to talk about?

43:40.951 --> 43:42.494
Isn't he just a petty offender?

43:42.578 --> 43:44.330
He's one of Heo Joong-se's men.

43:44.413 --> 43:47.082
He was livid
and ready to disband your department,

43:47.166 --> 43:48.792
but I managed to coax him in time.

43:48.876 --> 43:50.836
I told you to just put up with it

43:50.919 --> 43:53.964
for two more years.
Why do you have to keep causing trouble?

43:54.048 --> 43:57.760
Wow, so that hooligan is
one of the President's men?

43:57.843 --> 43:59.345
Now this is interesting.

43:59.428 --> 44:02.806
Unfortunately, he attacked my niece.

44:02.890 --> 44:03.891
Did he?

44:07.061 --> 44:08.437
Still, you can't.

44:08.520 --> 44:10.230
Concede on this one.

44:10.314 --> 44:12.941
Just give him a lecture in court
and let him go.

44:13.942 --> 44:15.277
What if I say I can't?

44:20.282 --> 44:22.993
Then that will leave me
in an awkward situation.

44:23.077 --> 44:24.536
And if that's the case,

44:24.620 --> 44:27.706
you too, will also find yourself
in a much awkward situation.

44:28.415 --> 44:29.958
All right.

44:30.042 --> 44:32.002
Let me think about it.

44:33.837 --> 44:35.589
I just love you these days.

44:35.673 --> 44:37.633
You've been awfully good, listening to me.

44:37.716 --> 44:40.219
So let's stop barging in here, all right?

44:41.929 --> 44:45.974
Exactly! Instead of having me
barge in here,

44:46.058 --> 44:49.103
invite me every now and then.

44:54.817 --> 44:57.319
Is your house as beautiful as ever?

44:59.655 --> 45:01.323
Just like how it was?

45:02.199 --> 45:04.660
Do you miss the house you were a maid at?

45:19.925 --> 45:21.093
Don't…

45:21.844 --> 45:24.012
Don't you ever say that again.

45:24.888 --> 45:28.892
I was a guest there
who had stayed there temporarily.

45:28.976 --> 45:31.437
Don't you ever insult me.

45:33.689 --> 45:34.857
All right.

45:34.940 --> 45:36.483
I'll take that to heart.

45:59.882 --> 46:02.009
-We are Jukchang!
-We are Jukchang!

46:02.092 --> 46:04.428
-We are the power!
-We are the power!

46:05.012 --> 46:09.683
-Jukchang! Jukchang!
-Jukchang! Jukchang!

46:09.766 --> 46:12.769
-Jukchang! Jukchang!
-Jukchang! Jukchang!

46:21.278 --> 46:24.740
-Jukchang! Jukchang!
-Jukchang! Jukchang!

46:24.823 --> 46:30.662
-Jukchang! Jukchang!
-Jukchang! Jukchang!

46:30.746 --> 46:32.623
As you can see, the atmosphere here

46:32.706 --> 46:35.584
at the Supreme Court
is hot due to today's trial

46:35.667 --> 46:37.878
Our citizens who fully
support the defendant

46:37.961 --> 46:40.631
<i>are continuing to protest
even inside the Supreme Court.</i>

46:40.714 --> 46:42.674
<i>The Supreme Court has decided </i>

46:42.758 --> 46:45.511
no to have an open trial to the public

46:45.594 --> 46:49.598
citing safety reasons
due to the build-up of tension.

46:52.059 --> 46:53.727
The court is now in session.

46:54.311 --> 46:55.729
Mr. Kim Choong-sik.

46:55.812 --> 46:58.899
My name is Kim Ju-won.
Please call me Kim Ju-won.

47:00.400 --> 47:03.862
In court, you are trialed under
your registered name.

47:03.946 --> 47:05.405
Mr. Kim Choong-sik.

47:06.114 --> 47:08.867
Let me ask you one more time.
Mr. Kim Choong-sik.

47:10.244 --> 47:11.328
Yes, Your Honor.

47:12.996 --> 47:14.373
You are before the court today

47:14.456 --> 47:17.376
for instigating and abetting

47:17.459 --> 47:19.419
random group violence

47:19.503 --> 47:22.005
against foreign workers, women,
and the LGBTIQ.

47:22.089 --> 47:23.006
Your Honor?

47:23.715 --> 47:25.384
Do you have something to say?

47:25.467 --> 47:26.802
-Yes.
-Go on.

47:31.056 --> 47:32.975
DEFENDANT

47:39.398 --> 47:41.900
Before we start the trial,
I would like to make

47:41.984 --> 47:44.570
a solemn declaration
before our history and our people.

47:47.155 --> 47:48.782
My heroic deed is not something

47:48.865 --> 47:51.743
that may be judged
by a mere, worldly court.

47:51.827 --> 47:55.122
For this reason, I wish to make
a declaration of national salvation.

47:55.914 --> 47:58.125
Mr. Kim, the court is not
a place for propaganda.

47:58.208 --> 47:59.543
The judges
in the era of Japanese Imperialism

47:59.626 --> 48:02.296
would have said the same to
our patriotic independence fighters.

48:02.379 --> 48:06.174
What is the truth you are concealing
that you're so afraid of, Judge Kang?

48:07.259 --> 48:09.219
All right.

48:09.303 --> 48:10.721
Let's hear it.

48:17.519 --> 48:19.563
A man of principles must confront

48:19.646 --> 48:22.065
a million who only chase
their own interests.

48:23.191 --> 48:24.776
Therefore I, Kim Ju-won,

48:24.860 --> 48:28.447
will gladly become the devil
for my beloved homeland.

48:28.530 --> 48:30.657
So fellow Koreans!
Let's end this hypocrisy,

48:30.741 --> 48:32.284
and put our people first.

48:32.367 --> 48:35.120
These three years of the pandemic
has savaged the job market

48:35.787 --> 48:39.207
and now the foreigners have invaded
our land, indulging in crime.

48:39.916 --> 48:44.838
Our women parade in the streets
in their arms, cooing all over them.

48:44.921 --> 48:47.799
This is how they are robbing
our youth of jobs,

48:47.883 --> 48:49.384
of our women,

48:49.468 --> 48:51.553
and now, our spirit.

48:52.262 --> 48:55.265
To restore order to our country

48:56.016 --> 48:58.727
means to reclaim our rightful
ownership of this land.

49:02.397 --> 49:05.150
I say this with confidence,
with the love for my country.

49:05.233 --> 49:07.235
Let's drive the foreigners off!

49:07.319 --> 49:10.697
Let's chase out the mutts
from the Republic of Korea!

49:10.781 --> 49:13.909
For a clean Korea! For a safe Korea!

49:13.992 --> 49:17.287
<i>Let's rebuild this country.
That is patriotism,</i>

49:21.958 --> 49:23.502
and we are the power.

49:23.585 --> 49:25.337
<i>Power! Yes, that's right!</i>

49:26.171 --> 49:28.256
<i>That's our leader right there, gentlemen.</i>

49:28.340 --> 49:29.591
<i>Guys, vote for him! Quick!</i>

49:29.675 --> 49:31.802
<i>Let's see the stats. 55, 56, 57…</i>

49:34.846 --> 49:37.766
Hey, what is this? What's going on?

49:37.849 --> 49:40.227
It looks like his followers have
formed a coalition.

49:46.525 --> 49:47.776
Are you finished?

49:48.485 --> 49:50.612
Yes, I'll stop here for now.

49:51.655 --> 49:54.116
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, Your Honor.

49:54.199 --> 49:56.952
Are you aware where those foreign workers

49:57.035 --> 49:59.705
you and your followers
assaulted are working at?

49:59.788 --> 50:03.125
Well?
Should a revolutionary mind such details?

50:03.208 --> 50:06.503
They work at a sewerage construction site
and they had lost two of their colleagues

50:06.586 --> 50:08.296
due to a toxic gas leak.

50:08.380 --> 50:11.800
The work there had been delayed because
no one was willing to go down there.

50:12.884 --> 50:16.555
Mr. Kim, whose jobs
did these workers rob, exactly?

50:17.222 --> 50:20.392
We will always see
innocent victims in war.

50:20.475 --> 50:23.812
Do not devalue the rightful rage
of our people, Your Honor.

50:24.771 --> 50:25.856
Did you say,

50:26.606 --> 50:28.900
"our people," and "rightful rage?"

50:37.117 --> 50:38.744
It sure does look rightful.

50:38.827 --> 50:40.328
Right?

50:40.412 --> 50:41.747
It is very rightful.

50:42.414 --> 50:45.834
Those foreigners deserve that
for trying to steal our women.

50:45.917 --> 50:49.087
Haven't you heard of an untainted,
homogenous nation?

50:49.755 --> 50:51.673
Did you say, "our women?"

50:51.757 --> 50:56.136
Women are also citizens of this country,
not some object you'd lent to someone.

50:57.137 --> 50:59.306
"Our women," my ass.

51:03.310 --> 51:06.646
I'm sorry, that wasn't appropriate
for in the courtroom.

51:06.730 --> 51:09.733
I couldn't help my rightful rage.

51:10.400 --> 51:13.361
That sounded like cursing.
Your voice was too soft to catch that.

51:13.445 --> 51:15.071
How about you come down here
and tell me again?

51:15.155 --> 51:16.948
-Mr. Kim.
-Or should I go up there?

51:22.078 --> 51:24.956
Mr. Kim, please focus.

51:30.837 --> 51:32.672
-Mr. Kim?
-Yes, Your Honor.

51:32.756 --> 51:34.549
I suggest you calm down.

51:34.633 --> 51:36.092
Yes, Your Honor.

51:36.176 --> 51:38.178
Though it's my first time
meeting you today,

51:38.261 --> 51:40.096
I'm starting to pity you already.

51:40.180 --> 51:42.933
I can't help but wonder
what a tough life you must've led.

51:43.558 --> 51:46.144
Well, I remember meeting you before
but I guess you don't.

51:46.228 --> 51:48.021
-Your Honor?
-Yes.

51:48.104 --> 51:51.024
May I have your permission to step down

51:51.107 --> 51:53.318
and continue my conversation
with the Defendant?

51:53.401 --> 51:55.028
Yes, you may.

51:55.612 --> 51:56.571
Thank you.

52:15.006 --> 52:16.091
Here, before me…

52:18.343 --> 52:20.262
stands a young man.

52:20.345 --> 52:23.640
Though he pretends to be strong,
deep inside him is a child

52:24.266 --> 52:25.767
who is hurt.

52:27.185 --> 52:28.478
What the hell is this?

52:29.396 --> 52:32.148
I'm talking about the files you submitted

52:32.232 --> 52:34.734
as evidence for extenuating circumstances.

52:36.528 --> 52:37.779
What?

52:39.364 --> 52:41.741
Mr. Kim, you were desperate

52:41.825 --> 52:44.369
for attention from a young age,
am I correct?

52:44.452 --> 52:47.289
-What?
-Your grandmother was awfully worried.

52:47.372 --> 52:48.540
Here.

52:49.124 --> 52:53.253
<i>My Choong-sik isn't a bad boy, really.</i>

52:53.336 --> 52:55.046
-Grandmother…
<i>-I was told</i>

52:55.130 --> 52:57.382
<i>he'd been inciting some protest,</i>

52:57.465 --> 52:59.384
<i>-but he would never to that.</i>
-What is that?

52:59.467 --> 53:02.804
<i>He's just being immature, that's all.</i>

53:02.888 --> 53:03.972
Did we discuss this?

53:04.681 --> 53:05.724
<i>So please forgive him.</i>

53:05.807 --> 53:07.642
<i>By the way, Choong-sik.</i>

53:07.726 --> 53:10.896
<i>-That money you took…</i>
-Turn it off.

53:10.979 --> 53:13.023
<i>-Your Grandmother had saved that</i>
-Turn it off!

53:13.106 --> 53:15.692
<i>-towards her own funeral.</i>
-Don't turn it off.

53:15.775 --> 53:19.613
<i>So return that money to her
if not anything else.</i>

53:19.696 --> 53:20.947
<i>I'm asking you.</i>

53:21.031 --> 53:24.242
<i>Are you out of your mind?
Why mention such a thing?</i>

53:24.326 --> 53:27.162
<i>How will they hold your funeral otherwise?</i>

53:27.245 --> 53:30.957
<i>My goodness… You must have lost it!</i>

53:31.041 --> 53:34.085
Counsel,
what was Mr. Kim like as a student?

53:34.169 --> 53:37.797
In fact, his former homeroom teacher
finally agreed to testify.

53:37.881 --> 53:40.592
-Why don't we all watch it together?
-Testify to what?

53:41.426 --> 53:44.179
<i>Incite violence for a political purpose?</i>

53:45.055 --> 53:46.723
<i>Never.</i>

53:46.806 --> 53:50.435
<i>He did hang with the school bullies
when he was in school,</i>

53:50.518 --> 53:52.437
<i>but he was never a part of their group.</i>

53:52.520 --> 53:55.690
<i>It was more that he followed them
around, wanting to look cool.</i>

53:56.274 --> 53:58.818
<i>Oh wow, that was
a waste of time and money.</i>

53:58.902 --> 54:00.695
<i>A loser who pretended to be cool?</i>

54:00.779 --> 54:03.114
<i>You know Choong-sik?
He used to go to my school.</i>

54:03.198 --> 54:05.033
<i>And do you know what he did?</i>

54:05.116 --> 54:08.119
<i>He was expelled for setting up
spy cams in the girls' toilet.</i>

54:08.203 --> 54:11.957
<i>He's the last person to be
a revolutionary, or whatever it is.</i>

54:12.040 --> 54:14.417
<i>So please pardon him.</i>

54:15.961 --> 54:18.546
So they will frame him a loser
instead of a devil?

54:24.052 --> 54:25.845
This will mess things up big time.

54:25.929 --> 54:28.807
Though this is what the Defendant's
acquaintances say about him,

54:28.890 --> 54:32.060
there is one thing
that's been bothering me.

54:32.727 --> 54:37.524
Mr. Kim has incessantly requested
donations through his channel

54:37.607 --> 54:40.360
claiming he needs funds
for a revolution to save the nation.

54:40.443 --> 54:42.529
And the total amount collected
wasn't a small sum.

54:42.612 --> 54:44.739
Just what did you do with that money?

54:47.993 --> 54:49.411
Why are you avoiding my eyes, Mr. Kim?

54:49.494 --> 54:53.790
Did you perhaps, purchase explosives
or guns from the black market?

54:54.457 --> 54:57.252
What is this "revolution fund"
in the first place?

54:57.335 --> 54:59.004
I know nothing.

54:59.087 --> 55:01.297
I exercise my right to remain silent.

55:01.381 --> 55:02.757
Mr. Kim, if this is all true,

55:03.925 --> 55:05.885
this is an offense against the state.

55:05.969 --> 55:07.762
And the punishment for treason

55:07.846 --> 55:11.349
is the death penalty
or imprisonment for life.

55:11.433 --> 55:13.685
-Are you aware of this, Mr. Kim?
-No, Your Honor.

55:14.936 --> 55:16.563
Do you have anything
to add to that, Counsel?

55:16.646 --> 55:17.647
Yes.

55:17.731 --> 55:21.860
It wasn't a rebellion my client had
been preparing for with that money.

55:21.943 --> 55:26.698
I was hesitant to disclose this
as this is a private matter,

55:26.781 --> 55:29.534
but I guess I have no other option.
Shall we have a look?

55:30.452 --> 55:33.246
-Here it is.
<i>-I'm an online streamer,</i>

55:33.329 --> 55:37.459
<i>and Mr. Kim started donating heavily
after he got on a competitive streak</i>

55:37.542 --> 55:40.086
<i>against one of my other fans.</i>

55:40.170 --> 55:41.880
<i>He'd donate millions every day.</i>

55:41.963 --> 55:45.508
No! I do not know this person!

55:45.592 --> 55:47.635
What the hell is this?

55:47.719 --> 55:50.263
-Mr. Kim, calm down.
<i>-He'd keep pestering me to meet him.</i>

55:50.346 --> 55:52.932
<i>It's just so overbearing.</i>

55:53.016 --> 55:54.893
<i>I really would like him to stop.</i>

55:56.686 --> 55:59.397
Did you perhaps also send
your grandmother's savings to…

56:00.315 --> 56:02.400
Wow, that's going too far.

56:05.820 --> 56:07.781
One moment. It's okay.

56:09.741 --> 56:13.036
It's okay. I promised to have you out
with a stay of execution.

56:14.496 --> 56:15.705
Resume your seat, now.

56:16.289 --> 56:18.249
It's okay.

56:21.377 --> 56:24.214
Your Honor and distinguished judges,

56:24.881 --> 56:27.842
as you can see,
my client is not a revolutionary,

56:28.468 --> 56:31.554
nor is he a threat to our state,
who incites rebellion.

56:31.638 --> 56:36.643
To be frank with you, his crimes are petty
for him to even face trial.

56:36.726 --> 56:37.727
Counsel.

56:37.811 --> 56:40.772
Though the scale of his wrong-doing
is not minute,

56:40.855 --> 56:44.692
we will appreciate it if you would
give him a chance to turn himself around.

56:58.623 --> 57:00.375
We have thought about what would be

57:00.458 --> 57:03.169
the most appropriate form
of punishment for the Defendant,

57:03.962 --> 57:08.675
between flogging or penal servitude.

57:10.552 --> 57:12.470
However, there were also opinions

57:13.221 --> 57:15.682
to give him another chance
considering his young age.

57:15.765 --> 57:18.726
Therefore this Court has decided to

57:18.810 --> 57:22.480
sentence him to three years in prison
with a stay of execution of five years.

57:24.983 --> 57:27.944
However, given the nature of the offense

57:28.027 --> 57:30.780
and the Defendant's likelihood
of recidivism,

57:31.656 --> 57:34.534
the Defendant is
to wear an electronic anklet

57:34.617 --> 57:36.911
<i>and placed under probation.</i>

57:39.664 --> 57:42.876
His location will be shown
in real-time on Dike app

57:42.959 --> 57:45.044
based on the signal transmitted
by the anklet.

57:47.464 --> 57:48.923
KIM CHOONG-SIK

57:49.007 --> 57:50.675
<i>Electronic anklet?</i>

57:50.758 --> 57:52.719
<i>You should be ashamed of yourself!</i>

57:52.802 --> 57:55.513
<i>How will you cope in summer?
You can't even wear shorts now!</i>

57:55.597 --> 57:59.267
<i>Calling for a party to hunt down Jukchang!</i>

58:00.268 --> 58:02.562
<i>Jukchang, try your best
to run away from us.</i>

58:02.645 --> 58:03.938
<i>We'll chase you to the end.</i>

58:04.022 --> 58:06.774
I ask our fellow citizens
who are watching this trial

58:07.442 --> 58:11.738
to be the Defendant's probation officer.

58:12.697 --> 58:14.866
I ask you not to take your eyes off him

58:14.949 --> 58:17.285
and check where he is at
and what he is up to at all times.

58:17.368 --> 58:19.913
Because he needs your attention.

58:23.082 --> 58:24.959
Don't you agree, Mr. Kim?

58:28.004 --> 58:30.173
After all the effort
I put into raising him,

58:30.256 --> 58:31.925
he ruined everything!

58:34.719 --> 58:37.430
Kang Yo-han!

58:38.515 --> 58:40.892
<i>Just give him a lecture in court
and let him go.</i>

58:41.601 --> 58:42.644
All right.

58:43.311 --> 58:45.313
Let me think about it.

58:45.396 --> 58:47.857
KIM CHOONG-SIK PLACED UNDER PROBATION

58:47.941 --> 58:50.443
FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY
TO TRACK HIS WHEREABOUTS

58:59.661 --> 59:01.829
So he played me, did he?

59:22.350 --> 59:25.144
Do you see Jukchang over there?
Let's teach him a lesson!

59:25.228 --> 59:27.063
This live show will continue
until the very end.

59:27.146 --> 59:29.691
<i>You know what that means.
Subscribe, like, and comment!</i>

59:48.001 --> 59:51.713
<i>The recent Kim Choong-sik case
is an embarrassment to the nation</i>

59:51.796 --> 59:54.299
which must never take place ever again.

59:54.382 --> 59:59.470
It is a vile disgrace to
all the voluntary salvation efforts

59:59.554 --> 1:00:03.433
<i>that are taking place nation-wide,
fuelled by the innocent patriotism</i>

1:00:03.516 --> 1:00:05.393
of our respectable citizens.

1:00:05.476 --> 1:00:08.104
It is a foul-smelling case
that taints their reputation.

1:00:08.187 --> 1:00:12.358
I say foul-smelling
because it reeks of conspiracy.

1:00:17.196 --> 1:00:18.531
Where did he go?

1:00:19.282 --> 1:00:21.409
-Let's try this way.
-Come on!

1:00:25.079 --> 1:00:28.750
Before that, is that man,
Kim Choong-sik, even Korean?

1:00:28.833 --> 1:00:30.209
I mean a real Korean like us.

1:00:30.293 --> 1:00:34.172
Not a fake Korean,
but a Korean with Korean citizenship!

1:00:34.255 --> 1:00:37.717
Because a descendant of Dangun
would never do such shitty…

1:00:39.427 --> 1:00:40.678
I apologize for my words.

1:00:40.762 --> 1:00:42.347
Because if he's pure Korean,

1:00:43.348 --> 1:00:47.226
<i>he would never do something
so shameful as this. That's all here.</i>

1:01:00.073 --> 1:01:01.074
Jukchang, peek-a-boo!

1:01:01.157 --> 1:01:04.285
Ready or not, here we come!

1:01:09.415 --> 1:01:13.169
-Are you going to let him be like that?
-Are you crazy?

1:01:13.252 --> 1:01:16.130
Don't you ever bring up
his name again, all right?

1:01:16.923 --> 1:01:19.175
Youn-jeong, this is just too much for me.

1:01:19.258 --> 1:01:20.843
Damn it.

1:01:25.139 --> 1:01:27.892
Hey! It's no use running away.

1:01:27.975 --> 1:01:29.560
This shows you where you are!

1:01:29.644 --> 1:01:32.772
Everyone! We will punish Jukchang for you!

1:01:32.855 --> 1:01:35.274
Let's begin.

1:01:38.528 --> 1:01:40.405
Hey, you think this is funny?

1:01:40.488 --> 1:01:42.031
Oh, you don't find it funny?

1:01:42.115 --> 1:01:44.283
Let's teach him a lesson!

1:01:53.251 --> 1:01:55.962
LET'S GET JUKCHANG!
JUKCHANG WILL DIE TODAY!

1:01:58.506 --> 1:02:01.551
-Butler, can you turn it off?
<i>-Yes, Master.</i>

1:02:02.844 --> 1:02:04.804
What is it? Are you feeling uncomfortable?

1:02:05.471 --> 1:02:07.432
I feel like we've created another monster.

1:02:08.474 --> 1:02:09.892
Monsters aren't created.

1:02:09.976 --> 1:02:13.730
They were always there, lying dormant.

1:02:15.523 --> 1:02:17.275
And they wake up
whenever there is a good excuse.

1:03:02.487 --> 1:03:03.696
You're working hard.

1:03:06.616 --> 1:03:08.743
Minister, how did you…

1:03:12.205 --> 1:03:13.664
Why are you so startled?

1:03:14.415 --> 1:03:15.917
It's not like you, Director Jung.

1:03:20.713 --> 1:03:23.132
You're here to search and seize, are you?

1:03:26.761 --> 1:03:28.638
That's so amusing.

1:03:29.430 --> 1:03:31.599
You think you're that great?

1:03:31.682 --> 1:03:36.270
For a Minister of Justice to
come here for that herself?

1:03:38.105 --> 1:03:41.692
Then did you have a favor to ask me?

1:03:43.611 --> 1:03:45.321
You must be mistaken about something,

1:03:45.988 --> 1:03:49.617
but I'm here to remind you
of where you stand.

1:03:51.244 --> 1:03:52.745
Where I stand?

1:03:52.829 --> 1:03:53.830
You know it too.

1:03:54.622 --> 1:03:55.957
Someone like you

1:03:56.624 --> 1:03:59.293
are better suited
for standing behind someone

1:03:59.377 --> 1:04:01.629
with their hands folded together politely.

1:04:01.712 --> 1:04:04.549
When people don't know their place,

1:04:05.258 --> 1:04:07.051
their ends aren't always good.

1:04:10.555 --> 1:04:12.390
You should speak for yourself, Minister.

1:04:13.307 --> 1:04:16.894
Perhaps it's you
who doesn't know your place.

1:04:16.978 --> 1:04:20.648
Do you honestly believe
you're the forerunner for the election?

1:04:20.731 --> 1:04:22.900
After what happened to your son?

1:04:24.485 --> 1:04:26.737
Don't you think
you're being overly confident?

1:04:28.155 --> 1:04:31.075
You think you erased
your past perfectly, do you?

1:04:34.579 --> 1:04:35.580
My past?

1:04:36.831 --> 1:04:39.375
Just what is it that
you want to talk about?

1:04:40.167 --> 1:04:43.588
Why do people around you
keep dying, I wonder.

1:04:44.463 --> 1:04:46.507
First, your mom
when you were 12 years old,

1:04:46.591 --> 1:04:49.760
and your dad who'd abandoned his family
when you were 20 years old.

1:04:49.844 --> 1:04:51.095
And then,

1:04:52.763 --> 1:04:55.224
there was Chairman Seo recently,
whom you were serving.

1:05:01.647 --> 1:05:04.650
I didn't know you wrote fiction.

1:05:05.484 --> 1:05:07.528
Your imagination is truly wild.

1:05:12.575 --> 1:05:14.285
Stick to what you do best.

1:05:16.829 --> 1:05:18.915
I heard you used to be a maid.

1:05:24.670 --> 1:05:25.922
How crude.

1:05:29.258 --> 1:05:30.551
I'll be seeing you again.

1:05:49.278 --> 1:05:50.446
<i>Yes, Seon-a.</i>

1:05:50.529 --> 1:05:53.449
Kang Yo-han leaked info about me
to Cha Gyeong-hui.

1:05:53.532 --> 1:05:55.326
<i>-What?</i>
-Look into it.

1:05:55.409 --> 1:05:56.661
<i>No way, not Kang Yo-han…</i>

1:05:56.744 --> 1:05:58.955
Just shut up and look into it!

1:06:02.083 --> 1:06:04.710
Stand in my way, and you'll pay the price.

1:06:04.794 --> 1:06:06.796
It looks like
you worked hard all this time.

1:06:07.588 --> 1:06:09.006
Would you be okay with that?

1:06:31.612 --> 1:06:33.197
I'm going to kill him.

1:06:35.866 --> 1:06:37.118
Kang Yo-han…

1:06:38.160 --> 1:06:40.579
I'm going to rip him to pieces!

1:06:46.002 --> 1:06:48.129
THANK YOU TO JUNG EUN-PYO
AND PARK HYOUNG-SOO

1:06:48.212 --> 1:06:49.880
FOR THEIR SPECIAL APPEARANCE

1:07:17.616 --> 1:07:20.161
<i>Leave them with no choice
but to point their swords at each other?</i>

1:07:20.244 --> 1:07:22.496
Hello, Young Master.

1:07:23.080 --> 1:07:25.916
<i>That's why I thought it might be fun
playing a game with you.</i>

1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:27.043
<i>Will she take your hand?</i>

1:07:27.126 --> 1:07:29.211
<i>You have one week.</i>

1:07:29.295 --> 1:07:31.005
<i>Bring me what I want.</i>

1:07:31.088 --> 1:07:32.673
<i>She may side
with Cha Gyeong-hui in the end.</i>

1:07:32.757 --> 1:07:34.800
<i>The start.</i>

1:07:34.884 --> 1:07:37.553
<i>She'll testify that Kang Yo-han
forced her to commit perjury.</i>

1:07:37.636 --> 1:07:40.181
<i>Isn't that too risky?
You said she's unpredictable.</i>

1:07:40.264 --> 1:07:42.933
<i>Even if we risk our everything,
it's do or die.</i>

1:07:44.435 --> 1:07:45.644
<i>You're scared of me?</i>

1:07:46.312 --> 1:07:47.480
<i>That's too bad.</i>

1:07:48.773 --> 1:07:53.235
