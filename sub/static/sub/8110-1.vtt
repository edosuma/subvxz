13:48.996 --> 13:50.463
BUT YOU WERE NEVER
BOARD-CERTIFIED.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.565
YOU'VE WORKED HERE TWO DAYS.
HOW--

13:52.599 --> 13:54.902
DR. CUDDY'S FIRST ASSIGNMENT
WAS FOR ME TO GET TO KNOW

13:54.935 --> 13:56.904
EVERYTHING ABOUT
DR. HOUSE'S TEAM...

13:56.937 --> 13:59.572
AND NOT TO BELIEVE ANYTHING
ANY OF THEM TOLD ME.

13:59.606 --> 14:02.943
I'M...NOT
A NEUROSURGEON?

14:05.312 --> 14:07.247
AND...VOILA!

14:07.280 --> 14:08.916
THE FIRST COURSE,

14:08.949 --> 14:12.085
I FLAKED SOME TENDER
YOUNG EARS OF CORN

14:12.119 --> 14:15.588
ON THE SIDE OF ASSORTED
EXOTIC BREAKFAST MEATS

14:15.622 --> 14:18.091
IN A CHILE SAUCE REDUCTION.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.260
AND THE...
SECOND COURSE?

14:20.293 --> 14:23.330
A SINGLE GRAPE.
TO CLEANSE THE PALATE.

14:23.363 --> 14:27.267
WHICH IS KIND OF A WASTE,
'CAUSE THERE IS NO THIRD COURSE.

14:27.300 --> 14:30.403
I'M GLAD WE STAYED IN.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.439
THIS IS ACTUALLY...
PRETTY GOOD.

14:32.472 --> 14:35.208
I CAN ALWAYS TELL
WHEN YOU LIE.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.179
I MEAN ALWAYS.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.950
I SLEPT WITH
MY FRESHMAN ROOMMATE.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.151
A LIE.
A TRUTH.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.086
YOU HAVE A TELL.
WHAT IS IT?

14:46.119 --> 14:48.155
FIRST ADMIT
THAT YOU WERE LYING.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.623
FINE. I WAS LYING.

14:50.657 --> 14:53.160
MY SEXUAL HISTORY
IS BORING AND PREDICTABLE.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.262
WHAT IS MY TELL?
ARE YOU KIDDING?

14:55.295 --> 14:56.964
IF I TELL YOU YOUR TELL,
YOU'LL GET RID OF IT,

14:56.997 --> 14:58.198
THEN I WON'T BE ABLE
TO TELL.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.000
WELL, THEN YOU HAVE TO
TELL ME SOMETHING

15:00.033 --> 15:01.501
I DON'T ALREADY KNOW
ABOUT YOU.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.703
EVEN THOUGH, TECHNICALLY,
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME SOMETHING

15:03.736 --> 15:05.172
THAT I DIDN'T ALREADY
KNOW ABOUT YOU.

15:05.205 --> 15:08.041
QUIT BEING SO DAMN LOGICAL
AND JUST TELL ME.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.943
[exhales]

15:09.977 --> 15:12.412
I USED TO HAVE
AN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP

15:12.445 --> 15:14.214
WITH A PHOTOGRAPH OF YOU.

15:14.247 --> 15:17.650
WELL, ACTUALLY,
A SOCK AND A PHOTOGRAPH.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.186
I KNOW.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.221
I WAS LYING.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.423
THE PHOTO YOU TOOK OF ME
AS SLEEPING BEAUTY ON HALLOWEEN.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.558
WHY ELSE WOULD YOU
TAKE THAT PICTURE?

15:27.694 --> 15:29.662
I HAVE TO PEE.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.633
HA! YOU CAN TELL.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.302
'CAUSE ACTUALLY,
I HAVE TO POO.

15:37.404 --> 15:40.640
[phone vibrating]

15:42.342 --> 15:44.011
[whispers]
WHAT?

15:44.044 --> 15:47.114
CUDDY'S ASSISTANT DECIDED
TO USE HIS OWN BRAIN.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.748
WHO PUT THAT IDIOT IDEA
INTO HIS HEAD?

15:48.781 --> 15:51.218
PERHAPS YOU COULD
FOLLOW THE SAME ADVICE.

15:51.251 --> 15:54.521
HE NOTIFIED DPH THAT THERE'S
NO NEUROSURGEON ON THE PREMISES.

15:54.554 --> 15:57.991
SAID HE LEGALLY HAD TO,
WHICH HE LEGALLY HAD TO.

15:58.025 --> 16:00.027
SOUNDS LIKE YOU GOT
THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.028
NO. I DON'T.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.362
YOU KNOW I DON'T.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.664
WHEN DPH SHOWS UP,
THEY'RE GONNA SHUT DOWN OUR E.R.

16:04.697 --> 16:07.034
THIS CAN'T BE FIXED.
IT IS WHAT IT IS, HOUSE.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.468
GREAT. I'VE GOT
EVERY FAITH

16:08.501 --> 16:10.703
IN YOUR ABILITY
TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

16:12.039 --> 16:14.074
[toilet flushes]

16:16.376 --> 16:18.211
I HAVE CALLED
EVERY NEUROSURGEON

16:18.245 --> 16:20.380
WITHIN A 45-MILE RADIUS--
NOTHING.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.015
I THINK HOUSE
IS JUST TESTING US.

16:22.049 --> 16:23.050
HE'S ALWAYS
TESTING US.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.217
TEST OR NOT,
IT'S A PROBLEM.

16:24.251 --> 16:25.652
IT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.187
WHY THE HELL IS IT HOUSE'S
PROBLEM?

16:27.220 --> 16:28.521
WHERE THE HELL IS CUDDY?

16:28.555 --> 16:30.157
WE EITHER REPORT THIS,

16:30.190 --> 16:32.059
AND HALF THE HOSPITAL
GETS SHUT DOWN,

16:32.092 --> 16:33.693
OR WE COVER IT UP
AND RUN THE RISK

16:33.726 --> 16:35.495
THAT THE ENTIRE HOSPITAL
GETS SHUT DOWN.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.430
OR WE GET RICHARDSON.

16:37.464 --> 16:38.698
HE'S SICK.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.700
AND WE'RE DOCTORS.
WE GET PEOPLE BETTER.

16:40.733 --> 16:44.071
FING FONG FOOEY?

16:46.373 --> 16:47.774
[sighs] OHH...

16:50.143 --> 16:51.678
CAN I OPEN THEM YET?

16:51.711 --> 16:53.646
JUST A SECOND.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.549
OKAY.
HOLD OUT YOUR HAND.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.355
OH...

17:03.623 --> 17:05.692
I ALWAYS WANTED
TO OPEN A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE

17:05.725 --> 17:07.360
WITH ONE OF THESE THINGS.

17:07.394 --> 17:10.230
YOU MIGHT WANNA
STAND BEHIND ME FOR THIS.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.566
OKAY...

17:15.835 --> 17:17.337
OH!

17:17.370 --> 17:19.272
YEAH!

17:19.306 --> 17:22.175
MM, I THINK I MIGHT HAVE...

17:22.209 --> 17:24.077
GOT THAT SLIGHTLY WRONG.

17:24.111 --> 17:25.445
[laughing]

17:25.478 --> 17:27.847
WELL, GOOD THING
I GOT A CASE.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.549
[knock on door]

17:29.582 --> 17:32.185
(Wilson)
HOUSE, OPEN UP.

17:32.219 --> 17:34.521
WE NEED TO TALK.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.855
[knocking]
JUST LET HIM IN.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.190
NO.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.625
HOUSE!

17:38.658 --> 17:40.827
IF WE JUST IGNORE HIM,
HE'LL GO AWAY.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.629
[knocking louder]

17:42.662 --> 17:44.431
HOUSE!

17:49.169 --> 17:52.872
[whispers]
I THINK HE FINALLY LEFT.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.807
BUT JUST IN CASE HE HASN'T,

17:54.841 --> 17:58.145
WHAT CAN WE DO THAT DOES NOT
INVOLVE TALKING?

18:02.349 --> 18:04.751
[cell phone rings]

18:04.784 --> 18:07.320
[whispering]
YOU TURNED ON MY RINGER!

18:07.354 --> 18:09.122
(Wilson)
I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE.

18:09.156 --> 18:11.191
I CAN HEAR YOUR
CELL PHONE RINGING.

18:11.224 --> 18:12.259
JUST LET HIM IN.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.194
NO!

18:14.227 --> 18:15.662
[cell phone ringing]
HE'S LIKE A STRAY...

18:15.695 --> 18:18.831
HE'LL EAT EVERYTHING,
SHED ALL OVER THE PLACE,

18:18.865 --> 18:21.434
AND CRAP ON THE FLOOR.

18:21.468 --> 18:22.535
[snap]

18:22.569 --> 18:23.903
HI.
THIS IS GREGORY HOUSE.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.538
I CAN'T TAKE YOUR CALL
AT THE MOMENT.

18:25.572 --> 18:26.839
PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE.

18:26.873 --> 18:30.143
IF THIS IS WILSON,
I'M FINE, NOT SUICIDAL,

18:30.177 --> 18:31.178
NOT ON DRUGS,

18:31.211 --> 18:33.846
COPING VERY WELL WITH THE LOSS
OF MY LAST PATIENT.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.349
SO FEEL FREE TO GO ABOUT
YOUR DAY WITHOUT WORRY.

18:36.383 --> 18:37.817
BEEP!

18:37.850 --> 18:39.319
HOUSE...

18:39.352 --> 18:41.854
YOU CAN'T JUST
NOT SHOW UP TO WORK.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.856
WHAT'S CUDDY GONNA SAY?

18:43.890 --> 18:46.459
IF THIS IS STILL WILSON...

18:46.493 --> 18:47.860
SHE GAVE ME THE DAY OFF.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.429
AND TOMORROW.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.198
OKAY, MAYBE NOT TOMORROW.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.166
BUT TODAY.
I'M FINE.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.701
NOW, GO AWAY.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.504
[silence]

18:57.537 --> 19:00.873
BEEP!

19:00.907 --> 19:03.910
IF YOU'RE NOT IN TOMORROW,
I'LL BE BACK.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.423
LOOK, YOU'RE THE ONLY
NEUROSURGEON WE'VE GOT.

19:16.456 --> 19:19.259
YOU HAVE TO SUCK IT UP
AND GO BACK TO THE HOSPITAL.

19:19.292 --> 19:21.894
WE'RE NOT ASKING YOU
TO OPERATE, JUST TO BE THERE.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.963
UNLESS YOU CAN TRANSPORT
THIS T-TOILET WITH ME,

19:23.996 --> 19:26.233
I'M NOT LEAVING
THE ROOM.

19:26.266 --> 19:27.700
I'LL GET A BUCKET.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.269
YOU'RE MISSING
THE POINT.

19:29.302 --> 19:32.272
I ATE BAD SUSHI.
I'M SICK. GO AWAY.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.940
WE CAN GIVE YOU PROMETHAZINE
FOR THE NAUSEA.

19:33.973 --> 19:34.941
ALREADY TOOK IT.

19:34.974 --> 19:37.944
AND TRIMETHOBENZAMIDE.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.479
MAYBE THIS ISN'T
FOOD POISONING.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.780
WHATEVER IT IS,

19:40.813 --> 19:42.882
IT MUST HAVE DAMAGED
THE LINING OF HIS STOMACH.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.717
TILL THAT HEALS,
NOTHING'S GONNA WORK.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.919
(Thirteen)
SO WE NEED TO TREAT
BOTH THAT AND THE NAUSEA.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.888
AND WHATEVER'S
WRONG WITH HIM.

19:48.921 --> 19:51.824
WE GIVE HIM ONDANSETRON
AND PROSTAGLANDINS.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.293
AND WHATEVER'S WRONG
WITH HIM.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.461
NEITHER OF THOSE WILL TREAT

19:54.494 --> 19:55.928
ANY POSSIBLE
UNDERLYING CONDITION.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.497
WHO CARES?
HE'S NOT OUR PATIENT.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.865
THE HOSPITAL IS.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.733
I CAN...HEAR YOU.

20:06.005 --> 20:09.476
YOU'RE PRETTY MISERABLE,
AREN'T YOU?

20:09.509 --> 20:13.012
WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO TAKE A...FAIRLY RISKY DRUG

20:13.045 --> 20:15.782
IF IT WOULD MAKE IT
ALL GO AWAY?

20:19.919 --> 20:22.021
AH!

20:22.054 --> 20:24.291
[laughs]

20:24.324 --> 20:28.328
[both breathing hard]

20:29.529 --> 20:32.265
WHY DIDN'T YOU
LET HIM IN?

20:34.867 --> 20:36.503
YOU WERE
THINKING ABOUT WILSON

20:36.536 --> 20:38.505
WHILE WE WERE HAVING SEX?

20:38.538 --> 20:41.007
THAT'S SO COOL!
SO WAS I.

20:41.040 --> 20:44.577
YOU WERE HIDING ME
FROM HIM.

20:44.611 --> 20:46.846
WHY?

20:46.879 --> 20:48.915
I WAS NOT HIDING YOU.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.984
I WAS PROTECTING
YOUR PRIVACY.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.887
WASN'T SURE IF YOU WERE
READY TO GO PUBLIC

20:54.921 --> 20:58.358
WITH THE WHOLE...
"US" THING YET.

20:59.659 --> 21:01.060
WHY WOULD I BE
DOING ALL THIS

21:01.093 --> 21:03.630
IF I WANTED IT TO BE
PRIVATE?

21:03.663 --> 21:05.798
OHH...

21:12.372 --> 21:16.042
OH. I NEVER EVEN ASKED.

21:18.845 --> 21:21.381
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT READY YET.

21:26.619 --> 21:29.055
HAVE YOU READ THE LIST
OF SIDE EFFECTS ON THOSE DRUGS?

21:29.088 --> 21:30.423
WE COULD CRASH HIS BP.

21:30.457 --> 21:31.791
I HAVEN'T HEARD A THUMP,

21:31.824 --> 21:33.760
SO I ASSUME HE'S STILL
QUIETLY PUKING.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.562
WE COULD BE
MAKING HIM WORSE.

21:35.595 --> 21:36.729
BIGGER PICTURE--

21:36.763 --> 21:38.465
WE'RE MAKING
THE HOSPITAL BETTER.

21:38.498 --> 21:40.767
WE CAN TEST FOR WHATEVER
YOU WANT TO TEST HIM FOR

21:40.800 --> 21:43.069
ONCE HE'S STABLE ENOUGH
TO GET BACK TO THE HOSPITAL.

21:43.102 --> 21:46.339
NOW, STOP BEING A GIRL
AND MOVE.

21:46.373 --> 21:48.708
SO YOU GONNA ASK ME
ABOUT THIS HUNTINGTON'S TRIAL,

21:48.741 --> 21:50.877
AND BY ASK, I MEAN
GIVE ME YOUR OPINION?

21:50.910 --> 21:52.579
NO.

21:52.612 --> 21:55.314
THERE IS ONE THING,
THOUGH.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.818
WILL YOU HAVE SEX
WITH ME?

22:00.487 --> 22:01.721
WHAT?

22:01.754 --> 22:03.723
WELL, THIS TRIAL MEANS
YOU'RE LEAVING RIGHT AWAY.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.358
I WAS PLAYING
A LONG GAME.

22:05.392 --> 22:07.860
DEADLINES
HAVE BEEN MOVED UP.

22:11.564 --> 22:13.366
WOW.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.834
THAT STUFF IS GOOD.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.436
THINK YOU CAN MAKE IT
BACK TO THE HOSPITAL?

22:16.469 --> 22:17.537
UH-HUH.

22:17.570 --> 22:19.406
THAT LAMP IS SHINY.

22:20.873 --> 22:23.510
I MEAN,
THE WAY IT SHINES IS...

22:23.543 --> 22:24.511
[laughs]

22:24.544 --> 22:25.778
SHINY.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.113
I TAKE IT THIS IS ONE
OF THE SIDE EFFECTS

22:27.146 --> 22:28.781
OF THE DRUGS.

22:28.815 --> 22:30.650
WHO CARES?
LET'S GO.

22:38.825 --> 22:40.827
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

22:40.860 --> 22:42.795
YOU THINK I'M AFRAID
TO GO PUBLIC?

22:42.829 --> 22:44.096
I'M GONNA PROVE YOU WRONG.

22:44.130 --> 22:45.798
WITH A TRIPOD?

22:45.832 --> 22:48.768
WITH A SEX TAPE.
WE'LL SEND IT TO WILSON.

22:48.801 --> 22:49.969
IT'S A WIN-WIN.

22:50.002 --> 22:51.504
WE GET TO DO IT AGAIN,

22:51.538 --> 22:54.140
AND...HE MIGHT ACTUALLY
LEARN SOMETHING.

22:54.173 --> 22:56.142
[glass tinkles]

22:56.175 --> 22:59.512
[whispers]
IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE'S
TRYING TO BREAK IN.

23:01.514 --> 23:03.149
IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING.

23:03.182 --> 23:05.384
STAY HERE.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.824
[window clatters]

23:11.858 --> 23:13.426
[grunts]

23:15.928 --> 23:17.129
HEY.

23:17.163 --> 23:18.898
STUCK?

23:18.931 --> 23:20.467
BUMMER.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.902
LOOKS PAINFUL.

23:22.935 --> 23:26.706
CHAMOMILE
OR ENGLISH BREAKFAST?

23:26.739 --> 23:29.476
WOULD YOU STOP
BEING AN ASS

23:29.509 --> 23:32.445
AND PULL ME OUT OF HERE?

23:32.479 --> 23:34.146
YOU DIDN'T GET
MY MESSAGE EARLIER?

23:34.180 --> 23:36.916
YEAH. BUT AS SOMEONE
ONCE TOLD ME,

23:36.949 --> 23:38.918
EVERYBODY LIES.

23:38.951 --> 23:40.052
I'M FINE.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.689
JUST STAYING HOME,
CHILL-LAXIN'.

23:42.722 --> 23:44.056
YOUR PATIENT DIED,

23:44.090 --> 23:46.092
YOU IGNORE MY CALLS,
AND YOU WON'T OPEN THE DOOR.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.727
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE FINE.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.463
I THINK YOU MIGHT BE
THROWING AWAY A DRUG-FREE YEAR.

23:50.497 --> 23:52.999
OR...I'M IGNORING YOU
FOR A DIFFERENT REASON.

23:53.032 --> 23:54.834
SEX WITH MY GIRLFRIEND.

23:54.867 --> 23:58.137
HMM.

23:58.170 --> 23:59.772
WILL YOU PLEASE JUST--

23:59.806 --> 24:02.041
PLEASE LET ME IN?

24:16.823 --> 24:19.025
THANK YOU.

24:19.058 --> 24:21.193
AND SINCE WHEN DID YOU
START REFERRING TO HOOKERS

24:21.227 --> 24:22.795
AS GIRLFRIENDS?

24:22.829 --> 24:25.532
SHE'S NOT A HOOKER.

24:25.565 --> 24:27.199
WHAT ARE--WHA--

24:27.233 --> 24:28.501
REALLY?

24:28.535 --> 24:31.538
BEGINS WITH "C",
ENDS WITH UDDY.

24:34.073 --> 24:35.708
HOW MANY VICODIN
HAVE YOU TAKEN?

24:35.742 --> 24:36.876
I'M SERIOUS.

24:36.909 --> 24:38.978
CUDDY AND I
ARE NOW CUDDY AND I.

24:39.011 --> 24:41.047
THERE'S AN "I"
IN CUDDY.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.749
HOUSE...IT'S OKAY.

24:42.782 --> 24:45.852
ALMOST ALL ADDICTS
RELAPSE A FEW TIMES.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.987
SHE'S IN MY BEDROOM.

24:49.288 --> 24:52.124
YOU'RE HALLUCINATING,
HOUSE.

24:52.158 --> 24:55.494
HONEY BUNS!
WE GOT COMPANY.

25:02.268 --> 25:04.236
[sighs]

25:10.342 --> 25:12.579
PUPILS ARE NORMAL.
PULSE IS NORMAL.

25:12.612 --> 25:14.113
BETTER THAN THAT.

25:14.146 --> 25:16.549
THEY'RE BOTH
TOTALLY AWESOME.

25:16.583 --> 25:18.618
I'M NOT ON DRUGS.

25:18.651 --> 25:21.588
SO...WHY DID YOU LIE
ABOUT CUDDY?

25:21.621 --> 25:23.289
TO MAKE A POINT.

25:23.322 --> 25:25.725
PROBABLY SOMETHING TO DO
WITH SHUTTING YOU UP.

25:25.758 --> 25:28.561
IT'S MY GO-TO IDEA.

25:28.595 --> 25:30.730
YOU DO SEEM OKAY.

25:30.763 --> 25:32.164
YOU WANT ME TO STICK AROUND?

25:32.198 --> 25:33.265
I COULD DO MY USUAL THING

25:33.299 --> 25:35.568
OF PRETENDING I LIKE
WATCHING MONSTER TRUCK RALLIES,

25:35.602 --> 25:37.069
IF THAT WOULD
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

25:37.103 --> 25:39.105
NO. YOU GO.

25:40.773 --> 25:43.175
HOUSE...YOU COULD HAVE
DIED.

25:43.209 --> 25:46.078
YOU HAD A PATIENT
WHO DID DIE IN YOUR ARMS.

25:46.112 --> 25:47.914
YOU SHOULDN'T BE ALONE.

25:47.947 --> 25:50.683
I KNOW.
THAT'S WHY I CALLED A HOOKER.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.284
NOW, GO AWAY.

25:52.318 --> 25:55.354
'CAUSE...
YOU'LL BE EXTRA.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.089
ARE YOU REALLY OKAY?

25:57.123 --> 25:59.592
ARE YOU GONNA
BREAK IN AGAIN?

25:59.626 --> 26:02.161
YOU CHECKED MY PULSE.
YOU CHECKED MY PUPILS.

26:02.194 --> 26:05.131
I'LL MAIL YOU
THE URINE SAMPLE.

26:06.198 --> 26:07.233
[door closes]

26:20.146 --> 26:22.782
HOW COME I'VE NEVER
EVEN MET YOU GUYS?

26:22.815 --> 26:24.751
Y-YOU'RE LIKE THE GREATEST...

26:24.784 --> 26:26.118
GUYS. YOU KNOW
FLUORESCENT LIGHTS

26:26.152 --> 26:28.154
FLICKER AT THE SAME FREQUENCY
AS THE HUMAN BRAIN?

26:28.187 --> 26:30.623
YOU KNOW THE HUMAN BRAIN
DOESN'T FLICKER?

26:30.657 --> 26:32.391
DOESN'T TAKE A BRAIN SURGEON
TO FIGURE OUT

26:32.424 --> 26:35.061
THAT HE CAN'T PERFORM
BRAIN SURGERY.

26:35.094 --> 26:36.128
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

26:36.162 --> 26:38.197
HIGH...BLOOD SUGAR.

26:38.230 --> 26:40.299
HE'LL BE FINE AS SOON
AS WE REHYDRATE HIM.

26:40.332 --> 26:41.233
THAT'S A RELIEF.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.368
THANK GOD.

26:42.401 --> 26:44.303
DPH GUY WILL BE HERE
IN 20 MINUTES.

26:47.339 --> 26:49.241
WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM?

26:49.275 --> 26:50.643
HIGH BLOOD SUGAR.

26:50.677 --> 26:51.844
YOU JUST SAID SO.

26:51.878 --> 26:53.780
CHASE IS RUNNING LABS.

26:53.813 --> 26:55.414
RIGHT NOW THE TOP TWO
CONTENDERS ARE HEPATITIS

26:55.447 --> 26:57.183
AND PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE.

26:57.216 --> 27:01.153
SO...IS TODAY REALLY
YOUR LAST DAY?

27:01.187 --> 27:03.255
FLYING OUT TOMORROW.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.825
HOW LONG A LEAVE
ARE YOU TAKING?

27:05.858 --> 27:07.359
DEPENDS.

27:07.393 --> 27:08.661
ON THE DRUG TRIAL.
SOUNDS RISKY.

27:08.695 --> 27:09.729
YADDA, YADDA.

27:09.762 --> 27:10.930
YOU DON'T THINK
I SHOULD DO IT.

27:10.963 --> 27:11.998
MESSAGE HEARD.

27:12.031 --> 27:13.299
NO. I APPROVE.

27:13.332 --> 27:15.902
LIVING FAST
AND DYING YOUNG IS CRAP.

27:15.935 --> 27:18.437
IF YOU HAVE A CHANCE
TO GET BETTER...

27:18.470 --> 27:21.340
I SAY GOOD FOR YOU.

27:24.043 --> 27:26.245
I BROUGHT WILSON IN HERE
SPECIFICALLY TO GO PUBLIC,

27:26.278 --> 27:28.915
JUST LIKE YOU REQUESTED.

27:28.948 --> 27:30.249
I PRESSURED YOU.

27:30.282 --> 27:33.886
WILSON COMING THROUGH
THE WINDOW PRESSURED YOU.

27:33.920 --> 27:37.323
IF YOU'RE FORCED INTO THIS,
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

27:41.260 --> 27:43.662
DO YOU HAVE ANY RESPONSE
TO THAT?

27:45.364 --> 27:48.167
[objects banging]

27:48.200 --> 27:51.003
GAME ON.

27:51.037 --> 27:52.905
IS HE BETTER?
YEP.

27:52.939 --> 27:54.974
YOU'RE LYING TO ME
AGAIN, AREN'T YOU?

27:55.007 --> 27:56.342
YEP.
THEN WE'RE SCREWED.

27:56.375 --> 27:57.376
DON'T WE HAVE
TO TELL--

27:57.409 --> 27:58.945
OH! DAMN.

27:58.978 --> 28:01.413
DR. RICHARDSON'S
PREPPING FOR SURGERY.

28:01.447 --> 28:03.816
YEAH. I NEED TO TALK
TO HIM.

28:03.850 --> 28:06.118
HE'S PREPPING FOR SURGERY.
SO YOU SAID.

28:06.152 --> 28:08.487
I JUST NEED TO CONFIRM
HE IS WHO YOU SAY HE IS

28:08.520 --> 28:11.423
AND THAT HE'S
A LICENSED NEUROSURGEON.

28:11.457 --> 28:13.125
WELL,
HERE'S HIS PAPERWORK.

28:13.159 --> 28:14.460
HIS HOSPITAL I.D.'s
RIGHT THERE.

28:14.493 --> 28:16.262
YOU CAN...SEE IT'S HIM.

28:16.295 --> 28:18.264
YEAH. I SHOULD
STILL TALK TO HIM.

28:18.297 --> 28:20.132
THEY'VE ALREADY SCRUBBED.
HE'D HAVE TO BE RE-STERILIZED.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.334
THE PATIENT'S ANESTHESIA
WOULD HAVE TO BE ADJUSTED.

28:22.368 --> 28:25.204
WHY DID YOU REPORT
HE WASN'T HERE?

28:27.439 --> 28:30.076
I MUST HAVE...
MISUNDERSTOOD.

28:38.484 --> 28:40.352
(Richardson)
OH...WHY...

28:40.386 --> 28:41.888
WHY...

28:41.921 --> 28:43.455
WHY IS IT SO...
SO HOT IN THERE?

28:43.489 --> 28:44.991
OH!

28:46.458 --> 28:47.927
AHH.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.997
LA-DEE-DAH.

28:52.464 --> 28:54.033
WOODSTOCK, BABY.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.367
IS HE STONED?

28:55.401 --> 28:57.904
NO. WE'RE PRETTY
SURE HE'S GOT--

28:57.937 --> 28:59.939
OH, I'M SURE YOU HAVE
AN EXPLANATION,

28:59.972 --> 29:00.907
BUT I DON'T CARE.

29:00.940 --> 29:03.475
SEE, YOU NEED TO HAVE
A DOCTOR ON THE PREMISES

29:03.509 --> 29:05.344
WHO CAN ACTUALLY DO
NEUROSURGERY.

29:05.377 --> 29:08.280
TELL THE ATTENDING
TO DIVERT ALL AMBULANCES AWAY

29:08.314 --> 29:09.782
AND START CALLING
OTHER HOSPITALS

29:09.816 --> 29:12.885
AND SEE WHO CAN TAKE
YOUR STABILIZED ICU PATIENTS.

29:12.919 --> 29:14.821
THOSE DEPARTMENTS
ARE SHUTTING DOWN.

29:17.456 --> 29:19.391
"DESIGN" FOR FIVE POINTS.
GOT IT.

29:19.425 --> 29:22.328
"HEAR."
GOT IT.
BOTH VERSIONS.

29:22.361 --> 29:25.998
"LOVE."

29:26.032 --> 29:27.366
YOU DIDN'T SEE LOVE.

29:27.399 --> 29:29.501
WOW. I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D TAKE

29:29.535 --> 29:32.504
MY LACK OF BOARD GAME SKILLS
SO PERSONALLY.

29:32.538 --> 29:34.240
[drops pen]

29:34.273 --> 29:36.375
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU LOVED ME?

29:36.408 --> 29:38.210
DIDN'T A WISE WOMAN
ONCE SAY--

29:38.244 --> 29:40.512
AND BY ONCE,
I MEAN TWO HOURS AGO--

29:40.546 --> 29:42.414
"WHY DO YOU HAVE TO ANALYZE
EVERYTHING TO DEATH?

29:42.448 --> 29:44.250
WHY CAN'T THIS
JUST BE NICE?"

29:44.283 --> 29:45.351
I TOLD YOU I LOVED YOU.

29:45.384 --> 29:47.319
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU LOVED ME BACK.

29:47.353 --> 29:50.923
YOU DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD
GIVE ME CAUSE FOR CONCERN?

29:50.957 --> 29:52.324
NO. 'CAUSE WORDS
DON'T MATTER.

29:52.358 --> 29:54.526
ACTIONS MATTER.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.996
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA
TAKE A STAND HERE.

29:57.029 --> 29:58.264
YOU CAN'T SAY--
NOPE.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.132
WHY?

30:00.166 --> 30:01.367
BECAUSE...

30:01.400 --> 30:03.970
I FORGOT TO GRAB A "V."

30:09.575 --> 30:11.410
LOBE.

30:11.443 --> 30:13.345
GETS YOU ONE POINT.

30:14.914 --> 30:17.549
ONE.

30:34.133 --> 30:36.102
LABS SHOW HE'S NEGATIVE
FOR EVERYTHING.

30:36.135 --> 30:38.504
I'M GUESSING AT LEAST
ONE OF THEM IS WRONG.

30:38.537 --> 30:40.106
WHO CARES?
THE E.R. AND THE ICU

30:40.139 --> 30:42.441
ARE HALF-EMPTY AND THE PLACE
IS CRAWLING WITH SUITS.

30:42.474 --> 30:43.409
IT'S OVER.

30:43.442 --> 30:45.177
YOU DO KNOW WE STILL HAVE
A SICK PATIENT HERE.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.113
RIGHT?
HE'S THE GUY SITTING

30:47.146 --> 30:50.216
RIGHT BEHIND YOU,
TAKING OFF HIS CLOTHES AGAIN.

30:50.249 --> 30:52.384
UH, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

30:52.418 --> 30:53.953
UH, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST SIT DOWN

30:53.986 --> 30:55.354
AND TAKE IT EASY?

30:55.387 --> 30:57.123
HE SHOULD BE COMING DOWN
BY NOW.

30:57.156 --> 30:59.558
AND YET...I'M NOT.

30:59.591 --> 31:01.293
WHAT IF HIS BEHAVIOR

31:01.327 --> 31:04.063
ISN'T A SIDE EFFECT
OF THE ONDANSETRON?

31:04.096 --> 31:06.165
WHAT IF IT'S A SYMPTOM?
THANK YOU.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.167
WHAT CAUSES DELIRIUM
AND NAUSEA?

31:08.200 --> 31:10.636
(Taub)
HE'S BEEN STUCK HERE
IN THE HOSPITAL A FEW DAYS.

31:10.669 --> 31:12.404
NOBODY ELSE IS SICK,
SO IT CAN'T BE ENVIRONMENTAL.

31:12.438 --> 31:14.273
NOT EXACTLY STUCK.
I SNUCK OUT.

31:16.408 --> 31:18.110
FREEDOM IS MY BIRTHRIGHT.

31:18.144 --> 31:20.079
WHERE DID YOU GO?

31:20.112 --> 31:22.214
THE SEAFOOD FESTIVAL
AT THE CONVENTION CENTER.
WE'RE SCREWED.

31:22.248 --> 31:25.051
SEAFOOD FESTIVAL HAS STUFF
FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD

31:25.084 --> 31:26.452
IN COMBINATIONS
NOBODY EVERY THOUGHT OF.

31:26.485 --> 31:28.187
WE COULD BE HERE
ALL YEAR.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.621
YOU HAD SHRIMP?
UH-HUH.

31:29.655 --> 31:31.223
AND CRAB?
LOBSTER?
UH-HUH.

31:31.257 --> 31:32.992
UH-HUH.
AND...

31:33.025 --> 31:36.228
I ATE WHATEVER
LOOKED GOOD.

31:36.262 --> 31:38.164
DID YOU EAT ANY ROE?

31:38.197 --> 31:40.366
LITTLE TINY EGGS?
NUMMY!

31:40.399 --> 31:44.003
TOAD EGGS WILL CAUSE NAUSEA,
AND THEY CAN GET YOU HIGH.

31:44.036 --> 31:46.438
IF I'M RIGHT,
THE ANTIDOTE IS FAST-ACTING.

31:46.472 --> 31:48.440
IF WE CAN GET HIM TO KEEP
HIS CLOTHES ON LONG ENOUGH,

31:48.474 --> 31:52.144
HE CAN PASS
AS A FUNCTIONING NEUROSURGEON.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.247
[keys clicking]

31:55.281 --> 31:57.950
UM...

31:57.984 --> 31:58.951
FRANCE.

31:58.985 --> 32:00.486
AND NOT PARIS OR THE RIVERA,

32:00.519 --> 32:02.454
BUT THERE'S THIS PLACE
IN NORMANDY.

32:02.488 --> 32:04.490
IT'S ON A...
A TIDAL ISLAND.

32:04.523 --> 32:06.692
EVERYONE WHO'S NOT STAYING
IN ONE OF THE SMALL INNS

32:06.725 --> 32:08.694
HAS TO LEAVE
BEFORE THE TIDE COMES IN.

32:08.727 --> 32:13.532
YOU HAVE THIS 900-YEAR-OLD
FORTRESS ALL TO YOURSELF.

32:13.565 --> 32:16.268
IT'S CALLED...

32:16.302 --> 32:19.071
MONT SAINT-MICHEL?

32:19.105 --> 32:21.207
THAT'S IT.
HAVE YOU BEEN THERE?

32:21.240 --> 32:24.376
NOPE. BUT I GOT A PRETTY
GOOD IDEA WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.478
H-HOW DID YOU KNOW?

32:26.512 --> 32:28.380
YOU USED TO HAVE A PICTURE
OF IT AS A SCREENSAVER.

32:28.414 --> 32:30.249
THAT WAS YEARS AGO.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.351
I GUESS
IT'S A MEMORABLE PLACE.

32:32.384 --> 32:34.987
NOW, UNFORTUNATELY, WE CAN'T
FLY STRAIGHT TO NORMANDY,

32:35.021 --> 32:37.489
BUT THE LAYOVER IN LONDON'S
ONLY A COUPLE OF HOURS.

32:37.523 --> 32:38.991
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?

32:39.025 --> 32:40.592
IT'S ALL THERE.

32:40.626 --> 32:42.161
ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS CLICK CONFIRM,

32:42.194 --> 32:42.961
AND WE'RE EATING CROISSANT

32:42.995 --> 32:45.631
AND BEING INSULTED
BY STINKY PEOPLE

32:45.664 --> 32:47.366
THIS TIME TOMORROW.

32:47.399 --> 32:50.202
DON'T WORRY.
I USED WILSON'S CREDIT CARD.

32:50.236 --> 32:51.303
I CAN'T.

32:51.337 --> 32:53.372
I'M KIDDING.

32:53.405 --> 32:55.674
I USED YOUR CREDIT CARD.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.743
HOUSE...

32:57.776 --> 32:59.211
THE HOSPITAL
DOES NOT NEED YOUR BODY.

32:59.245 --> 33:01.047
I DO.
SO DOES MY DAUGHTER.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.248
WELL,
SHE CAN COME TOO.

33:02.281 --> 33:05.184
OR TO GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE
SHE CAN GO.

33:05.217 --> 33:08.287
[laughs]
THIS IS CRAZY.

33:10.422 --> 33:14.326
SO...YOU BREAK OFF
YOUR ENGAGEMENT,

33:14.360 --> 33:16.728
BUT YOU WON'T ADJUST
YOUR SCHEDULE.

33:19.431 --> 33:22.134
I CAN'T.

33:22.168 --> 33:24.703
NOT...TOMORROW.

33:24.736 --> 33:28.374
BUT...TWO WEEKENDS
FROM NOW.

33:28.407 --> 33:30.742
IF RACHEL'S GONNA
STAY WITH MY MOM,

33:30.776 --> 33:35.081
I'M GONNA NEED A LITTLE
BIT OF PREP TIME.

33:35.114 --> 33:36.415
OKAY.

33:43.089 --> 33:44.323
WHAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK?

33:44.356 --> 33:45.324
WHAT IF I STAY THIS WAY
FOREVER?

33:45.357 --> 33:47.226
THE ANTIDOTE WORKS QUICKLY.
IF WE'RE RIGHT,

33:47.259 --> 33:49.295
YOU SHOULD BE BACK
TO YOUR OLD SELF IN NO TIME.

33:49.328 --> 33:50.562
MY OLD SELF WAS BORING.

33:50.596 --> 33:52.164
CAN'T WE KEEP THE NEW SELF?

33:52.198 --> 33:54.366
JUST LAY DOWN,
AND STOP UNBUTTONING.

33:57.169 --> 33:59.305
I'M SORRY
THAT I READ YOUR NOTE

33:59.338 --> 34:01.240
AND LOOKED IN YOUR LOCKER.

34:01.273 --> 34:04.510
YOU GET USED TO THAT
KIND OF THING AROUND HERE.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.778
DO YOU HAVE ANYONE GOING
WITH YOU TO ROME?

34:06.812 --> 34:08.414
IS THAT YOUR
PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE WAY

34:08.447 --> 34:09.815
OF ASKING ME
IF I'M SEEING SOMEBODY ELSE?

34:09.848 --> 34:11.150
I HOPE YOU ARE.

34:11.183 --> 34:14.086
I MEAN...I HOPE
YOU HAVE SOMEONE WITH YOU.

34:14.120 --> 34:15.521
IF I'M SCARED ABOUT THIS,

34:15.554 --> 34:17.523
I CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW YOU MUST FEEL.

34:17.556 --> 34:19.725
YOU SHOULDN'T BE ALONE.

34:19.758 --> 34:21.527
IF YOU WANT...

34:21.560 --> 34:23.629
I COULD FLY OVER
FOR A FEW DAYS.

34:23.662 --> 34:26.365
FRIENDS.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.500
I APPRECIATE THAT,

34:28.534 --> 34:30.869
BUT I THINK I'LL BE OKAY.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.538
I GUESS WE TOOK
THE LONG WAY AROUND

34:32.571 --> 34:34.740
TO BEING FRIENDS, HUH?

34:37.576 --> 34:40.679
I GUESS WE ALL DID.

34:45.717 --> 34:47.519
THANK YOU.

34:47.553 --> 34:49.288
FOR EVERYTHING.

34:49.321 --> 34:52.158
YOU'RE WELCOME.

34:52.191 --> 34:53.459
FOR EVERYTHING.

34:53.492 --> 34:54.626
[chuckles]

34:54.660 --> 34:57.763
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

35:03.235 --> 35:05.671
I REALLY DO HAVE TO LEAVE.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.676
I KNOW.

35:12.611 --> 35:16.148
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

35:18.217 --> 35:22.188
THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK.

35:29.595 --> 35:31.730
THAT'S IT?

35:31.763 --> 35:34.266
YOU CAN'T JUST...
SAY THAT AND SHUT UP.

35:34.300 --> 35:36.168
IT'S JUST
A STATEMENT OF FACT.

35:36.202 --> 35:39.305
IT'S NOT
A DEBATABLE PROPOSITION.

35:39.338 --> 35:42.908
RIGHT. BECAUSE YOU CAN
SEE THE FUTURE.

35:42.941 --> 35:45.577
NO. BUT I CAN SEE
THE PAST.

35:45.611 --> 35:47.179
AND YOU'RE GONNA REMEMBER

35:47.213 --> 35:49.748
ALL THE HORRIBLE THINGS
I'VE DONE,

35:49.781 --> 35:51.517
AND YOU'RE GONNA
TRY TO CONVINCE YOURSELF

35:51.550 --> 35:53.285
THAT I'VE CHANGED.

35:53.319 --> 35:55.421
AND I'M GONNA START DOING
THOSE HORRIBLE THINGS AGAIN,

35:55.454 --> 35:57.889
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T CHANGED.

35:57.923 --> 36:00.626
THEN YOU'LL REALIZE THAT...

36:03.962 --> 36:07.933
I'M AN INSANE CHOICE
FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS A KID.

36:07.966 --> 36:09.468
AND FROM THERE,

36:09.501 --> 36:11.470
IT'S A SHORT STEP
TO THE INEVITABLE CONCLUSION

36:11.503 --> 36:15.274
THAT ALL OF THIS...

36:15.307 --> 36:17.376
WAS A MISTAKE.

36:20.612 --> 36:23.915
TELL ME ANY OF THAT
ISN'T TRUE.

36:32.258 --> 36:34.260
MERCY DOESN'T HAVE
ENOUGH ROOM IN THEIR ICU

36:34.293 --> 36:35.261
TO HANDLE THE OVERFLOW, SO--

36:35.294 --> 36:36.595
(Chase)
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.597
I BELIEVE YOU WANTED TO TALK
TO DR. RICHARDSON,

36:38.630 --> 36:40.532
OUR NEUROSURGEON?

36:40.566 --> 36:43.302
I'M SORRY THAT WE MET
UNDER SUCH TRYING CIRCUMSTANCES.

36:43.335 --> 36:45.637
I HOPE YOU RESTORE OUR RATING
AS A LEVEL ONE TRAUMA CENTER

36:45.671 --> 36:47.639
AND REOPEN THE E.R.
AND THE ICU IMMEDIATELY.

36:47.673 --> 36:49.375
AN ACCIDENTAL CASE
OF POISONING.

36:49.408 --> 36:51.009
DR. RICHARDSON
HAS BEEN TREATED

36:51.042 --> 36:52.511
AND IS READY TO RESUME WORK.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.646
HMM.

36:54.680 --> 36:57.516
TOUCH YOUR NOSE
WITH YOUR INDEX FINGER

36:57.549 --> 36:59.685
AND TELL ME HOW YOU TREAT
A CEREBRAL CONTUSION.

36:59.718 --> 37:02.588
UH, I-I-I WOULD WATCH
FOR EDEMA

37:02.621 --> 37:05.291
AND TRANSTENTORIAL
HERNIATION.

37:06.658 --> 37:08.560
GOOD ENOUGH.

37:08.594 --> 37:10.562
TURN IT AROUND.

37:10.596 --> 37:12.531
YOU'RE GONNA BE UP LATE.

37:12.564 --> 37:15.867
NEXT TIME...[whispers]
AVOID RESPONSIBILITY.

37:15.901 --> 37:16.835
CAKE?

37:16.868 --> 37:18.870
TAUB THOUGHT WE SHOULD
HAVE A LITTLE PARTY

37:18.904 --> 37:20.539
TO SEE YOU OFF PROPERLY.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.341
HE GETS SENTIMENTAL
ABOUT THESE THINGS.

37:22.374 --> 37:24.343
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
FLASHED HIM.

37:24.376 --> 37:26.778
SPEAKING OF WHICH...

37:26.812 --> 37:29.448
EARLIER TODAY
I ASKED YOU ABOUT...

37:29.481 --> 37:31.383
HAVING SEX.

37:31.417 --> 37:32.351
YOU GAVE ME A LOOK

37:32.384 --> 37:35.020
THAT ALMOST CERTAINLY
COULD ONLY MEAN NO.

37:35.053 --> 37:38.324
HOWEVER, ON THE OTHER HAND,
I'D BE REMISS IF I...

37:38.357 --> 37:41.460
DIDN'T FOLLOW UP
AND CONFIRM.

37:41.493 --> 37:43.529
SEE? IT'S THE SAME LOOK.

37:43.562 --> 37:45.297
SO IF IT DIDN'T MEAN NO
THE FIRST TIME,

37:45.331 --> 37:46.898
THEN...
NO.

37:46.932 --> 37:48.534
NO. NO, NO.

37:48.567 --> 37:50.369
NO.
OKAY.

37:50.402 --> 37:51.403
NO PRESSURE.

37:51.437 --> 37:53.805
DOES THAT METHOD
EVER WORK?

37:55.073 --> 37:57.042
AT LEAST ONCE.

38:04.916 --> 38:07.853
MM, I'M, UM...
GETTING MIXED SIGNALS.

38:07.886 --> 38:10.288
SEE YOU AT THE CAKE.

38:13.425 --> 38:15.060
THE ONLY TIME
YOU'RE AFRAID

38:15.093 --> 38:18.029
IS WHEN YOU'RE HAPPY.

38:18.063 --> 38:20.399
YOU JUST DON'T
EXPECT IT TO LAST.

38:20.432 --> 38:22.901
'CAUSE IT DOESN'T.

38:22.934 --> 38:25.036
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

38:26.972 --> 38:29.641
I'VE DONE
HORRIBLE THINGS TO YOU.

38:29.675 --> 38:34.380
AND I'LL DO HORRIBLE
THINGS AGAIN TO YOU.

38:34.413 --> 38:36.081
BUT BECAUSE OF ONE
STUPID MOMENT

38:36.114 --> 38:40.085
WITH A DYING GIRL
AND A PILE OF RUBBLE...

38:40.118 --> 38:42.421
YOU THINK I CAN CHANGE.

38:44.523 --> 38:47.325
TELL ME WHERE I'M WRONG.

38:50.396 --> 38:53.699
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO CHANGE.

38:53.732 --> 38:56.902
I KNOW
YOU'RE SCREWED UP.

38:56.935 --> 38:59.771
I KNOW YOU ARE ALWAYS
GONNA BE SCREWED UP.

38:59.805 --> 39:02.941
BUT YOU'RE THE MOST
INCREDIBLE MAN I'VE EVER KNOWN.

39:06.945 --> 39:09.915
YOU ARE ALWAYS GONNA BE...

39:09.948 --> 39:13.585
THE MOST INCREDIBLE MAN
I HAVE EVER KNOWN.

39:15.421 --> 39:18.156
SO UNLESS YOU'RE
BREAKING UP WITH ME,

39:18.189 --> 39:20.992
I AM GOING HOME NOW.

39:32.638 --> 39:35.474
I LOVE YOU.

39:35.507 --> 39:37.409
[Joe Purdy's Good Days
plays]

39:37.443 --> 39:40.078
- * OH, YEAH, AND LATER ON

39:40.111 --> 39:42.448
* WE TOOK A SOUTHBOUND TRAIN

39:42.481 --> 39:45.584
* YEAH, AND IT WAS COLD OUT

39:45.617 --> 39:47.486
* YEAH, IT WAS FREEZING
DOWN RAIN *

39:47.519 --> 39:50.055
* YEAH, AND IT'LL LET UP

39:50.088 --> 39:51.156
* IF WE ALL SCREAMED
FOR THE CHANGE *

39:51.189 --> 39:53.425
WHERE'S THIRTEEN?

39:53.459 --> 39:55.427
I DON'T THINK
SHE'S COMING.

39:55.461 --> 39:57.963
WHAT'S GOING ON?

39:57.996 --> 40:00.466
SHE'S NOT GOING TO ROME.

40:00.499 --> 40:02.067
YOU MEAN
SHE CHANGED HER MIND?

40:02.100 --> 40:03.435
I CALLED
THE HOSPITAL IN ROME

40:03.469 --> 40:04.470
TO SEE WHEN SHE WAS
SCHEDULE FOR SURGERY.

40:04.503 --> 40:06.472
WHY WOULD YOU--
DOESN'T MATTER.

40:06.505 --> 40:09.508
POINT IS, SHE'S NOT
EVEN IN THE TRIAL.

40:09.541 --> 40:12.177
NEVER HEARD OF HER.

40:12.210 --> 40:15.847
SHE'S BEEN LYING TO US
ALL DAY.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.148
WELL, HAVE YOU TRIED--

40:17.182 --> 40:19.985
BOTH HER PHONE LINES
HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED.

40:20.018 --> 40:22.921
SHE'S JUST GONE.

40:22.954 --> 40:27.459
* NO, NO,
JUST THE GOOD DAYS *

40:27.493 --> 40:30.562
* YEAH, YEAH,
JUST THE GOOD DAYS *

40:30.596 --> 40:32.831
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

40:32.864 --> 40:34.800
YEAH.

40:34.833 --> 40:36.234
* JUST THE GOOD DAYS

40:36.267 --> 40:44.476
