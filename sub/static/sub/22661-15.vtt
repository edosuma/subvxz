WEBVTT

00:03.438 --> 00:04.134
ADAM:
Hey.

00:04.178 --> 00:05.353
How was yoga class?

00:05.396 --> 00:07.920
Amazing.
I feel very centered,

00:07.964 --> 00:10.836
'cause we skipped it and went
to the wine bar next door.

00:12.969 --> 00:15.102
And then we nama-stayed there
for a couple hours.

00:15.145 --> 00:17.582
I'm all for it.

00:17.626 --> 00:20.629
You're never more lovely than
when you're half in the bag.

00:20.672 --> 00:23.197
Oh, um, I talked to my parents,
and they're driving in

00:23.240 --> 00:24.633
from Virginia for Easter.

00:24.676 --> 00:26.939
What? No, no, no.
I thought you said

00:26.983 --> 00:30.073
Frank and Alice weren'tcoming,
so I invited myparents.

00:30.117 --> 00:32.989
You got to stop telling me stuff
through the bathroom door.

00:34.773 --> 00:37.080
[groans]Oh, this is not good.

00:37.124 --> 00:39.082
Why not? A house
full of grandparents--

00:39.126 --> 00:40.736
that's what a holiday's
supposed to be.

00:40.779 --> 00:43.130
[chuckles]
Not with these jokers.

00:43.173 --> 00:46.089
They are exactly the same,
but they hate each other.

00:46.133 --> 00:49.049
Like Alabama and Georgia.Yeah.

00:49.092 --> 00:51.399
ANDI: It all goes back
to when Katie was born,

00:51.442 --> 00:53.053
'cause both sets
of grandparents

00:53.096 --> 00:55.098
wanted to be called
Grandma and Grandpa.

00:55.142 --> 00:56.273
So they all agreed
that they'd settle it

00:56.317 --> 00:58.232
when they got
to the hospital.

00:58.275 --> 00:59.494
Yeah.
So my parents said

00:59.537 --> 01:01.191
that they would pick
her parents up on the way.

01:01.235 --> 01:02.323
So Frank and Alice

01:02.366 --> 01:03.498
are waiting
outside their hotel,

01:03.541 --> 01:05.195
my dad just drove
straight by

01:05.239 --> 01:06.805
and gave them
the finger.
Yeah.

01:06.849 --> 01:08.938
His parents got to
the hospital first,

01:08.981 --> 01:11.027
and claimed Grandma and
Grandpa for themselves.

01:11.071 --> 01:14.378
Yeah. And her parents
got stuck with Nana and Pop Pop.

01:15.988 --> 01:17.120
[chuckling]

01:17.164 --> 01:19.470
Which we don't
think is funny.

01:20.863 --> 01:22.604
They didn't take it well.

01:22.647 --> 01:24.823
No, I will
not be Nana.

01:24.867 --> 01:27.391
I'm already wearing the Grandma
sweatshirt, Bev-- I'm Grandma!

01:27.435 --> 01:28.827
Is that how
you talk

01:28.871 --> 01:31.961
to your clients at your
fortune teller business?

01:32.004 --> 01:34.224
I am a licensed therapist.

01:34.268 --> 01:37.140
And it is my professional
opinion that you are cuckoo!

01:37.184 --> 01:40.274
You cheated
to get here first.

01:40.317 --> 01:42.972
You drove by and gave me a
crude, one-fingered salute.

01:43.015 --> 01:46.149
I... I was just surprised
to finally see a Navy man.

01:46.193 --> 01:48.282
I sure as hell never saw one

01:48.325 --> 01:50.588
when my Army platoon was
pinned down by Charlie!

01:50.632 --> 01:52.199
We were on a ship.

01:52.242 --> 01:56.377
Oh, yes. Vietnam was
a great sea war.

01:56.420 --> 01:58.857
And it's been
14 years of that.

01:58.901 --> 02:00.163
Yeah. You know,
our folks

02:00.207 --> 02:01.904
should come with one
of those tornado sirens,

02:01.947 --> 02:04.124
so we have time
to board up the windows

02:04.167 --> 02:06.996
and strap ourselves
to the water heater.

02:07.039 --> 02:08.737
That's why we have a time share
in Lake Placid

02:08.780 --> 02:10.695
that we have to go to
every holiday.You do?

02:10.739 --> 02:11.957
Yeah.I love Lake Placid.

02:12.001 --> 02:13.872
It's not real. He made it up.

02:13.916 --> 02:17.180
It's just an excuse to avoid the
battle of the varicose veins.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.314
You know,
if you were a good brother,

02:20.357 --> 02:22.098
you would stay here and help me.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.447
Well, if you were
a smart brother,

02:23.491 --> 02:25.362
you would have thought
of the fake time share first.

02:25.406 --> 02:27.799
I know. I'm so jealous.

02:29.236 --> 02:31.107
ANDI:
Listen, we can't have

02:31.151 --> 02:34.197
both sets of grandparents
for the holiday, right?

02:34.241 --> 02:35.764
We have to uninvite
one of them,

02:35.807 --> 02:38.201
and I think my parents
deserve Easter this year.

02:38.245 --> 02:41.813
Deserve? I think that's
for the Easter Bunny to decide,

02:41.857 --> 02:44.294
not you.

02:44.338 --> 02:47.341
Okay, but my parents got stuck
with Thanksgiving,

02:47.384 --> 02:50.213
and that's a B-team holiday
compared to Christmas,

02:50.257 --> 02:51.910
which your parents got.

02:51.954 --> 02:52.781
Thanksgiving

02:52.824 --> 02:56.524
plus Easter equals Christmas.

02:57.786 --> 02:59.962
That's called math.

03:00.005 --> 03:03.095
Yes, my parents got Christmas,
but then they found out

03:03.139 --> 03:05.315
we took your parents
to Myrtle Beach.

03:05.359 --> 03:08.449
Christmas minus Myrtle Beach
equals Easter.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.016
Okay?

03:11.060 --> 03:14.237
So put that in your calculator
and smoke it.

03:14.281 --> 03:16.239
Look,

03:16.283 --> 03:19.111
all I'm saying is that your
parents live here, all right?

03:19.155 --> 03:20.722
They're with the kids
all the time.

03:20.765 --> 03:23.333
My parents only get to see them,
like, once or twice a year.

03:23.377 --> 03:25.683
Yeah, but I can't
uninvite mine.

03:25.727 --> 03:27.250
Well, I can't uninvite mine.

03:27.294 --> 03:29.296
I can't believe
you think your parents

03:29.339 --> 03:31.907
should get both Christmas
and Easter.

03:31.950 --> 03:33.256
Well, there are reasons.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.302
You remember when your mother
cooked Thanksgiving?

03:35.345 --> 03:37.086
What's that smell? Hmm?

03:37.129 --> 03:38.435
Is that a turkey roasting?

03:38.479 --> 03:40.916
No, it's liver.

03:43.484 --> 03:47.270
Our whole house smelled like
the inside of a burning cow.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.229
Okay.

03:49.272 --> 03:50.969
The only reason she makes that

03:51.013 --> 03:52.928
is because when I first
brought you home to meet them,

03:52.971 --> 03:54.321
you said you liked it.

03:54.364 --> 03:56.932
I was trying to sleep with you.

03:58.368 --> 03:59.456
I didn't know

03:59.500 --> 04:01.589
I was joining
the Liver for Life Club.

04:03.286 --> 04:04.722
Will you listen to yourself?

04:04.766 --> 04:06.594
You promised we'd never
fight about our parents.

04:06.637 --> 04:09.074
Again, I was trying
to sleep with you.

04:11.468 --> 04:13.470
â™ª

04:22.305 --> 04:23.915
Hey.
Hey.

04:23.959 --> 04:24.916
I got great news.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.178
I have great news, too.

04:26.222 --> 04:27.354
Oh, mine's better.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.138
BOTH:
My parents aren't coming.

04:30.095 --> 04:31.140
What?

04:31.183 --> 04:32.620
BOTH:
Your parents aren't coming?

04:33.969 --> 04:35.884
BOTH:
Our parents aren't coming!

04:35.927 --> 04:37.581
[both laugh]

04:37.625 --> 04:40.758
Yeah, mine cancelled 'cause
they didn't want to see yours.

04:40.802 --> 04:42.151
Mine, too. [chuckles]

04:42.194 --> 04:44.588
They finally agree on
something. Look at that.

04:44.632 --> 04:46.895
[laughs]
Wow.

04:46.938 --> 04:49.376
Crisis averted, huh?
Yeah.

04:49.419 --> 04:52.509
God, I feel like I
can admit to you now

04:52.553 --> 04:54.206
that I was gonna fake
a sprained ankle

04:54.250 --> 04:56.339
and spend the weekend in bed.

04:56.383 --> 04:59.777
I was gonna do the same thing
with lady problems.

04:59.821 --> 05:01.779
[both laugh]

05:01.823 --> 05:03.868
We are so cute.
Yeah.

05:03.912 --> 05:06.828
Why are there body parts
in our fridge?

05:06.871 --> 05:08.308
Oh. [chuckles]

05:08.351 --> 05:10.005
That's liver, honey.

05:10.048 --> 05:12.181
I-I got it for your nana to cook
before she cancelled.

05:12.224 --> 05:14.488
Yeah, Katie, will you take that
outside and put it in the trash?

05:14.531 --> 05:15.880
I want to eat an Easter dinner

05:15.924 --> 05:17.229
that doesn't look
like an autopsy.

05:17.273 --> 05:19.406
Ugh.

05:19.449 --> 05:21.495
Wait, put it back in the fridge.

05:21.538 --> 05:24.019
You know,
now that I think about it,

05:24.062 --> 05:27.239
if your parents aren't coming,
I should reinvite mine.

05:27.283 --> 05:29.938
Don't you put that
back in the fridge.

05:29.981 --> 05:31.156
[whistles]

05:31.200 --> 05:33.855
Listen, if we're gonna
reinvite anybody,

05:33.898 --> 05:35.073
it should be my parents.

05:35.117 --> 05:37.685
Put it back
in the fridge, Kate.

05:39.687 --> 05:41.079
Why does it get to be
your parents?

05:41.123 --> 05:43.865
Freeze, Katie.

05:43.908 --> 05:46.824
Because my parents are
Grandma and Grandpa.

05:46.868 --> 05:47.999
The real deal.

05:48.043 --> 05:49.523
Yours are Nana and Pop Pop.

05:49.566 --> 05:51.699
They're, like, the store brand.

05:55.311 --> 05:58.314
Did you just call my parents
the store brand?

05:59.489 --> 06:00.838
Okay, I'm putting this down.

06:00.882 --> 06:02.797
The place where I'm holding this
is getting warm,

06:02.840 --> 06:04.189
and I think I feel a heartbeat.

06:07.062 --> 06:10.195
I thought we agreed
not to fight about our parents.

06:10.239 --> 06:12.110
Well, hey, I like
the store brand.

06:12.154 --> 06:14.939
I mean, it's cheaper
and almost as good.

06:23.948 --> 06:25.776
I'm calling my mom.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.430
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

06:27.474 --> 06:29.824
Geez, Louise.

06:29.867 --> 06:32.435
Okay, look, maybe there's
a third way, okay?

06:32.479 --> 06:34.045
Listen, through no fault
of our own,

06:34.089 --> 06:36.047
a grandparent-free weekend

06:36.091 --> 06:38.441
has fallen into our laps.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.443
What if

06:40.487 --> 06:41.444
we say nothing?

06:41.488 --> 06:45.970
What if we reinvite nobody?

06:46.971 --> 06:50.018
We can't do that.

06:50.061 --> 06:52.673
Can we?

06:52.716 --> 06:54.588
I'd like to believe
we can do anything.

06:54.631 --> 06:56.807
That's what dreams
are made of, Andi.

06:58.896 --> 07:00.463
This is really just us

07:00.507 --> 07:03.335
making the world
a better place.

07:04.946 --> 07:06.164
Hmm.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.123
It's a little thin, but I'm in.

07:11.518 --> 07:12.693
ADAM:
Hey.

07:12.736 --> 07:14.085
My dad just called.

07:14.129 --> 07:15.086
Him and Mom are
stopping by, okay?

07:15.130 --> 07:16.566
But the kids are here.

07:16.610 --> 07:17.698
So?

07:19.134 --> 07:20.483
Hey, when you wanted
to have kids,

07:20.527 --> 07:23.355
I warned you they would be here
all the time.

07:23.399 --> 07:27.142
Adam, your parents
aren't coming to Easter

07:27.185 --> 07:29.100
because we told them
my parents were gonna be here.

07:29.144 --> 07:31.146
But they're not coming,

07:31.189 --> 07:33.714
and the kids know that.

07:33.757 --> 07:35.106
The kids are here!

07:35.150 --> 07:36.804
There it is!

07:36.847 --> 07:38.370
But they can't keep a secret.

07:38.414 --> 07:40.808
They'll let it slip,
and we'll get busted.
Yeah.

07:40.851 --> 07:42.200
Okay, uh...

07:42.244 --> 07:44.376
there's only one thing
we can do.

07:44.420 --> 07:46.378
Tell your parents the truth
and hope for the best?

07:46.422 --> 07:49.730
No. We teach the kids to lie.

07:49.773 --> 07:51.993
Smart.

07:52.036 --> 07:53.168
Yeah.

07:53.211 --> 07:54.822
Your folks
will never see that coming

07:54.865 --> 07:56.519
'cause no good parent
would ever do that.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.173
Yeah, yeah. I mean,

07:58.216 --> 07:59.435
we really should be
better people than this,

07:59.479 --> 08:01.089
but look who raised us.Right?

08:03.874 --> 08:05.006
ANDI:
I know

08:05.049 --> 08:06.834
we've told you for
your whole lives

08:06.877 --> 08:08.618
that it's wrong to lie,

08:08.662 --> 08:11.316
but it turns out there's
one or two exceptions.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.666
Mm-hmm. That's right.

08:14.102 --> 08:15.407
Now, there's bad lies,

08:15.451 --> 08:17.845
which are almost all lies,

08:17.888 --> 08:21.718
but occasionally,
there's a good lie,

08:21.762 --> 08:26.070
or what we like to
call a family lie.

08:28.116 --> 08:29.334
Oh, like that time

08:29.378 --> 08:32.207
you told us to say
Mom's hair looked good?

08:38.039 --> 08:40.911
What time was that?

08:40.955 --> 08:42.304
No time.

08:42.347 --> 08:44.349
It always looks good.Aw. [chuckles]

08:44.393 --> 08:47.048
See, that's an example
of a family lie.

08:49.920 --> 08:53.097
Okay, well,
another example would be

08:53.141 --> 08:55.056
keeping the fact
that Nana and Pop Pop

08:55.099 --> 08:56.100
aren't coming to Easter

08:56.144 --> 08:58.668
a secret
from Grandma and Grandpa.

08:58.712 --> 09:01.105
And if we don't,
you get in trouble?

09:04.456 --> 09:06.067
Give us a second.

09:11.463 --> 09:13.422
We'll do it...

09:13.465 --> 09:15.424
for a price.

09:15.467 --> 09:17.426
TEDDY:
We want

09:17.469 --> 09:20.168
unlimited time with the candy
in our Easter baskets.

09:20.211 --> 09:22.779
We eat till we get sick.

09:22.823 --> 09:25.260
Look, I don't care what
comes out of your mouth

09:25.303 --> 09:27.044
as long as it's not the truth.

09:29.220 --> 09:30.613
BEV:
Oh, we just stopped by

09:30.657 --> 09:32.397
to let you know

09:32.441 --> 09:34.008
that since you have other plans,

09:34.051 --> 09:35.749
we'll be going out
of town for Easter.

09:35.792 --> 09:38.403
Oh, well, good for you.

09:38.447 --> 09:40.101
Where are you guys gonna go?

09:40.144 --> 09:42.451
Disney World.[gasps]

09:42.494 --> 09:43.844
Uh, w-why? What?

09:43.887 --> 09:45.236
Why would you guys go there?

09:45.280 --> 09:46.890
That's for kids.

09:46.934 --> 09:48.849
Good point. Hey, kids.

09:48.892 --> 09:50.807
I've got a crazy idea.

09:50.851 --> 09:53.114
Why don't we take all of you?

09:53.157 --> 09:54.245
Huh?

09:54.289 --> 09:56.247
Oh, Joe, that sounds wonderful.

09:56.291 --> 09:57.901
But they can't come

09:57.945 --> 10:00.904
because they've chosen to
spend Easter here with...

10:00.948 --> 10:02.210
what do they call themselves?

10:02.253 --> 10:04.125
MeeMu and Flip Flop.

10:05.517 --> 10:07.868
Well, there goes Disney World.

10:07.911 --> 10:09.217
What?!

10:09.260 --> 10:11.088
What's happening?

10:11.132 --> 10:12.524
You never said
anything about...Whoa, whoa.

10:12.568 --> 10:14.222
You've got a runny nose.
Will you look at that?

10:14.265 --> 10:15.789
Let's take you into the pantry

10:15.832 --> 10:18.226
where we always handle
runny noses, huh? Here you go.

10:18.269 --> 10:21.011
[chuckles] Now, listen.

10:21.055 --> 10:22.230
No, youlisten.

10:23.274 --> 10:25.059
I'm going to Disney.

10:25.102 --> 10:27.235
Everything I love is there.

10:27.278 --> 10:28.540
But...

10:28.584 --> 10:29.716
No buts.

10:29.759 --> 10:31.892
I will end you over this.

10:39.116 --> 10:40.727
Andi!

10:40.770 --> 10:42.685
Be right there.So, Grandma.

10:42.729 --> 10:43.947
Let's circle back
to this Disney thing.

10:43.991 --> 10:45.340
Okay, you know what?
H-- Why don't we

10:45.383 --> 10:46.907
go help you dad
find the tissues?

10:46.950 --> 10:47.951
Huh?

10:50.040 --> 10:52.695
It's working.
Mmm.

10:52.739 --> 10:55.567
We're getting
this holiday back.

10:55.611 --> 10:59.180
Emme, we can't go to Disney
with Grandma and Grandpa,

10:59.223 --> 11:01.356
'cause Nana and Pop Pop would
be so jealous they'd have to--

11:01.399 --> 11:03.706
I don't know,
move in with us.
Yeah.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.404
I'm telling Grandma
and Grandpa everything.

11:06.448 --> 11:08.276
And then I'm
packing for Florida.

11:08.319 --> 11:10.844
Wait. Wait. Wait.

11:10.887 --> 11:14.238
Okay, uh, if you guys
stick to our plan

11:14.282 --> 11:16.632
and keep everything we've
talked about between us,

11:16.676 --> 11:18.286
we'll take you to...

11:18.329 --> 11:19.504
Disney World.
What?

11:20.767 --> 11:22.029
I was gonna take
them to frozen yogurt.

11:22.072 --> 11:23.726
I got a coupon.

11:23.770 --> 11:27.034
Nice try. I want
to hear more from the lady.

11:27.077 --> 11:30.733
We will take you
to Disney this summer.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.692
Great. Peak season.

11:32.735 --> 11:35.695
Why don't you just put all our
money in a pile and burn it?

11:35.738 --> 11:40.134
Okay, but we need to see dates,
receipts, confirmations.

11:40.177 --> 11:43.006
You don't trust
us to book it?

11:43.050 --> 11:45.269
You literally
just taught us to lie.

11:46.749 --> 11:49.317
Okay. Well,
it only took five of us,

11:49.360 --> 11:51.754
but we got that
runny nose handled.

11:51.798 --> 11:54.278
So are we all going
to Disney World?

11:54.322 --> 11:56.803
I don't think Nana has
ever taken you there,

11:56.846 --> 12:00.067
but that's really
something a grandma does.

12:00.110 --> 12:01.546
Mom,

12:01.590 --> 12:03.157
they're not going
to Florida with you.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.636
Are you kidding me?

12:04.680 --> 12:07.422
But we-we already
bought the tickets.

12:07.465 --> 12:09.598
Did you?

12:09.641 --> 12:12.775
Well, we could have.

12:15.822 --> 12:19.173
This is nice.
Mmm.

12:19.216 --> 12:21.523
You know how I know
there's no grandparents here?Hmm?

12:21.566 --> 12:24.831
The Golf Channel isn't playing
at the volume of a Who concert.

12:24.874 --> 12:26.441
[knocking on door]

12:26.484 --> 12:27.834
ALICE:
Andi.

12:27.877 --> 12:29.661
It's Mom and Dad.

12:29.705 --> 12:31.315
What are my
parents doing here?

12:31.359 --> 12:33.143
Wh...? What do we do?

12:33.187 --> 12:35.450
Uh, get low
and crawl upstairs.

12:35.493 --> 12:37.800
Very funny.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.497
Well, at least
it's an idea.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.848
You got anything?Yeah, open the door.

12:47.070 --> 12:48.506
Last chance.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.640
Happiness is over in three...

12:51.683 --> 12:53.642
two... one...

12:55.687 --> 12:58.386
Frank, Alice. Wow.

12:58.429 --> 12:59.648
Look who it is, Andi.

12:59.691 --> 13:02.520
Boy, Frank, you are
full of surprises.

13:02.564 --> 13:04.479
Well, I like
to keep things interesting.

13:04.522 --> 13:06.524
We can't all get by
on our good looks.

13:06.568 --> 13:09.223
And ever when we do,
it doesn't last forever.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.574
Well, I don't have
to tell you that.

13:12.617 --> 13:14.489
Get my bag.

13:14.532 --> 13:17.361
Hi, Daddy.
[laughs]Hello, kitten.

13:17.405 --> 13:19.799
Hi, Mom.Oh, hi, honey bun. Ooh.

13:19.842 --> 13:22.584
So, uh, wh-what
are you guys doing here?

13:22.627 --> 13:26.414
Well, uh, Joe and Bev
may have Easter Day,

13:26.457 --> 13:29.809
but we're making
a new holiday, Easter Eve.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.114
Where the kids
Mmm.

13:31.158 --> 13:32.507
get baskets full of candy,

13:32.550 --> 13:34.117
and they have an egg hunt.

13:34.161 --> 13:35.771
Ah.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.817
But th-that's what they do
on Easter.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.949
Oh, no. Oh, poor
Joe and Bev.

13:39.993 --> 13:42.952
It's gonna ruin
their Easter Day.

13:44.388 --> 13:45.868
Oh, well. You know,

13:45.912 --> 13:48.349
the ups and downs of life.Yeah.

13:48.392 --> 13:52.744
I am riding
that wave right now.

13:52.788 --> 13:55.312
I j-- I just wish you guys
hadn't gone to all this trouble.

13:55.356 --> 13:57.184
What trouble?
It was a quick

13:57.227 --> 13:59.577
seven-and-a-half hour drive.

13:59.621 --> 14:01.449
Yeah, and we only stopped once,

14:01.492 --> 14:03.146
and I peed behind a thorn bush.

14:03.190 --> 14:04.669
So...
Oh.

14:04.713 --> 14:06.236
I'm hoping that you have
some Neosporin

14:06.280 --> 14:07.455
and a floor mirror.

14:11.154 --> 14:14.070
What a beautiful
Easter story, Mom.

14:17.508 --> 14:19.989
She had to cook liver.

14:20.033 --> 14:24.211
The whole house smells
like a cat food factory.

14:24.254 --> 14:25.560
So open the window.

14:25.603 --> 14:27.214
That's not gonna do it.

14:27.257 --> 14:29.433
We're gonna need to drop
a load of Febreze on this place

14:29.477 --> 14:31.653
from one of those
firefighting planes.

14:33.481 --> 14:35.657
Okay. Honey, you need,
you need to settle down.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.441
Settle down?

14:37.485 --> 14:40.357
I've lied to my folks,
paid an arm and a leg

14:40.401 --> 14:42.490
to go to stupid Florida.

14:42.533 --> 14:45.493
I will have
my quiet holiday, okay?

14:45.536 --> 14:48.452
You need to get rid
of Meemu and Flip-Flop.

14:50.498 --> 14:52.543
I cannot believe
you just called them that.

14:52.587 --> 14:53.893
I did and it was fun.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.549
What happened to not fighting
about our parents?

14:58.593 --> 15:02.727
Your mother took my
shaving mirror two hours ago.

15:02.771 --> 15:04.947
Think of what it's seeing.

15:04.991 --> 15:08.690
Yeah, I saw my dad head upstairs
with a flashlight.

15:09.691 --> 15:12.650
It's a real expedition.

15:13.825 --> 15:16.437
Adam, I am not telling
my parents to leave, okay?

15:16.480 --> 15:18.134
They're here
because they love us.

15:18.178 --> 15:19.570
They're here because
they're trying to steal

15:19.614 --> 15:22.443
what they think
is my parents' holiday.

15:22.486 --> 15:23.661
Well, I think my parents

15:23.705 --> 15:25.576
are entitled to steal
a few holidays,

15:25.620 --> 15:29.450
just like your parents stole
the good grandparent names.

15:30.712 --> 15:32.670
Why don't you just
admit it, huh?

15:32.714 --> 15:35.282
You like your parents
better than mine.

15:35.325 --> 15:38.850
Of course I do,
they're my parents.

15:38.894 --> 15:41.288
Oh, I see.
You know what?

15:41.331 --> 15:42.898
I'd go sleep in the guest room
if it wasn't full

15:42.942 --> 15:44.682
of your parents
and liver farts.

15:44.726 --> 15:46.380
Oh.

15:46.423 --> 15:49.470
Come on, honey.
Come here.

15:49.513 --> 15:52.168
[sighs]
I'm sorry.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.562
Me, too. I...

15:54.605 --> 15:56.172
I don't want to
fight with you.

15:56.216 --> 15:58.479
They do this to us,
you know?

15:58.522 --> 16:00.307
If they weren't
so miserable together,

16:00.350 --> 16:02.657
we could have holidays
like normal people.

16:02.700 --> 16:03.963
Yeah.

16:04.006 --> 16:07.140
Like the people
in car commercials.

16:07.183 --> 16:09.620
Yeah. [sighs]

16:09.664 --> 16:11.405
You know what?
I'm done with this.

16:11.448 --> 16:12.797
I'm calling
my parents tomorrow,

16:12.841 --> 16:15.191
and I am ordering them
to come over here for Easter.

16:15.235 --> 16:16.584
We'll sit them all down
and we'll tell them

16:16.627 --> 16:18.325
we're sick of their fighting.

16:18.368 --> 16:20.370
Really?
Yeah.

16:20.414 --> 16:22.590
Right to their faces?

16:22.633 --> 16:23.983
Yep.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.375
Yeah. I'm more comfortable

16:25.419 --> 16:27.769
just rolling my eyes
behind their backs.

16:27.812 --> 16:31.991
Honey, nothing's gonna change
unless we change it.

16:32.034 --> 16:34.819
Okay.

16:34.863 --> 16:37.344
Okay. You know, I'm
not afraid of them.

16:37.387 --> 16:38.736
Good. Yeah.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.216
I'm glad we're
a team on this.

16:40.260 --> 16:41.739
We absolutely are.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.045
Mmm.
Yeah.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.699
After you do it, be sure
to come back up here

16:44.742 --> 16:46.701
and tell me how it went.

16:49.965 --> 16:52.750
Eh, eh, that's not
how you do it.

16:52.794 --> 16:54.578
You've got to hide
the egg,

16:54.622 --> 16:56.319
otherwise it's not
an egg "hunt,"

16:56.363 --> 16:57.712
it's an egg "see."

16:57.755 --> 16:59.366
All right,
we can do this.

16:59.409 --> 17:01.977
We just stick together,
and we get--

17:02.021 --> 17:04.066
Andi?

17:06.677 --> 17:07.635
I'm coming.

17:07.678 --> 17:08.766
Stop doing that.

17:08.810 --> 17:10.638
It took us 20 minutes
to get downstairs.

17:12.727 --> 17:13.858
I don't think a naval officer

17:13.902 --> 17:15.817
has to have anything
explained to him

17:15.860 --> 17:17.514
by an army grunt.

17:17.558 --> 17:20.648
Those are wise words,
Admiral Flip Flop.

17:20.691 --> 17:22.693
Boys, boys, come on,
let's not fight.

17:22.737 --> 17:23.868
It's Easter.

17:23.912 --> 17:26.480
Bev, try some
of my coffee cake.

17:26.523 --> 17:28.917
Your son says
it's magical.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.745
Magical, huh?

17:30.788 --> 17:33.661
Will it make you disappear
back to Virginia?

17:33.704 --> 17:35.750
Look at that.

17:35.793 --> 17:37.360
They need to hear this.
Come on.

17:37.404 --> 17:39.232
Okay, that's enough.

17:39.275 --> 17:40.581
We need to talk to you

17:40.624 --> 17:42.104
about these holidays, okay?

17:42.148 --> 17:44.454
It's not gonna be
an easy conversation,

17:44.498 --> 17:45.847
but we have to
clear the air.

17:45.890 --> 17:48.763
I think he's finally
gonna apologize.

17:48.806 --> 17:52.636
What? Me, apologize?
For what?

17:52.680 --> 17:54.769
For ruining the holidays.

17:54.812 --> 17:57.641
Why is she saying my words?

17:57.685 --> 17:59.295
Whenever we're all
together,

17:59.339 --> 18:02.690
you two are always
so tense and agitated.

18:02.733 --> 18:05.432
You're not easy
to be around.

18:05.475 --> 18:07.651
You're the ones
who cancelled Easter

18:07.695 --> 18:09.653
because you said you didn't
want to see each other.

18:09.697 --> 18:11.438
We were trying to be nice.
We don't want to

18:11.481 --> 18:14.354
put pressure on you,
because you're so fragile.

18:14.397 --> 18:15.833
[stammers]

18:15.877 --> 18:17.618
The only reason
we're tense is

18:17.661 --> 18:19.794
because you guys
fight all the time.

18:19.837 --> 18:22.101
Yeah, I mean, you seem
like you don't like each other.

18:22.144 --> 18:24.668
We're in-laws-- we're not
supposed to like each other.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.716
I really don't like
anybody.
Mmm.

18:31.936 --> 18:33.503
This generation,

18:33.547 --> 18:35.026
they think everybody's
supposed to be

18:35.070 --> 18:37.420
happy and nice all the time.

18:37.464 --> 18:40.249
An-And, if-if I may...

18:40.293 --> 18:42.512
Your unrealistic
expectations are

18:42.556 --> 18:44.035
the cause of the problem.

18:44.079 --> 18:45.298
Good point.Good point.

18:45.341 --> 18:47.387
That's right.Very good.

18:47.430 --> 18:49.389
Mm-hmm.It's true.

18:49.432 --> 18:53.828
Oh. Well, then,
I guess we're...

18:53.871 --> 18:55.482
Sorry?

18:56.874 --> 19:00.400
Somehow, we are.

19:00.443 --> 19:04.534
Oh, they feel bad.
That's nice.

19:04.578 --> 19:08.582
Well, you've really
taught us a lesson.

19:08.625 --> 19:09.887
Yeah.

19:09.931 --> 19:11.150
But, you know,
unfortunately, guys,

19:11.193 --> 19:12.760
I gotta go upstairs.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.544
Lady problems.

19:15.763 --> 19:16.807
What?

19:16.851 --> 19:17.982
And, Adam, you better

19:18.026 --> 19:19.332
come upstairs
and get off

19:19.375 --> 19:20.811
that ankle you
sprained yesterday.

19:23.858 --> 19:27.340
That is a beautiful
family lie.

19:30.952 --> 19:33.998
[Adam groaning]Aw...

19:40.179 --> 19:41.745
Joe.
Yeah?

19:41.789 --> 19:42.877
Let's watch some golf.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.183
Yeah.
Turn it up.

19:52.582 --> 19:54.280
I love having
all you guys here.

19:54.323 --> 19:57.283
Oh, we love being here.

19:57.326 --> 19:59.285
I always forget
about this part.

19:59.328 --> 20:01.330
I like this part.
Yeah.

20:03.419 --> 20:05.987
But they're the
crazy ones, right?

20:06.030 --> 20:08.729
Oh, yeah, it's wack-a-doo
city over there.

20:08.772 --> 20:10.513
[door opens]

20:10.557 --> 20:13.386
Hey, what time's
the ga-- Hey.

20:13.429 --> 20:14.474
Whoa.

20:14.517 --> 20:16.302
Look at this.

20:16.345 --> 20:19.696
Marcy, everybody's here.

20:19.740 --> 20:21.916
I see that.
[chuckles]

20:21.959 --> 20:23.483
Well, we just popped in
for a second.Yeah.

20:23.526 --> 20:26.312
We're heading to our
time-share any minute.

20:26.355 --> 20:27.835
Oh, well,
that's a shame.

20:27.878 --> 20:29.793
We never get to spend
time with you two.

20:29.837 --> 20:33.188
I know, but it's impossible
to get out of a time-share.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.320
Everybody knows that.
Right?

20:34.363 --> 20:36.365
You told me you got rid

20:36.409 --> 20:37.323
of all the grandparents.

20:37.366 --> 20:38.933
Got rid of us?

20:38.976 --> 20:40.239
What do you mean,
"got rid of us"?

20:41.327 --> 20:42.284
Adam, were you trying

20:42.328 --> 20:43.807
to have Easter without us?

20:43.851 --> 20:46.070
Don's time-share
is a fake.

20:46.114 --> 20:47.202
What?!
What?!

20:47.246 --> 20:48.943
What are you
doing to me?

20:48.986 --> 20:50.510
Happy Easter.

20:50.553 --> 20:52.076
Somebody get this man
some liver.
