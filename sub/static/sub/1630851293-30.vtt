THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

WE'D CHECK IN ON THE EVENT THAT

00:46.833 --> 00:47.533
STARTED ALL OF IT, THE JANUARY 6

00:47.600 --> 00:48.633
INSURRECTION.

00:48.700 --> 00:51.166
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:51.233 --> 00:52.000
THIS YEAR STARTED WITH THAT AND,

00:52.066 --> 00:53.300
AGAINST ALL BETTER JUDGMENT,

00:53.366 --> 00:56.733

FBI'S MOST WANTED LIST HAS

01:08.000 --> 01:09.833
THE FUGITIVE'S NAME IS

01:09.900 --> 01:11.000
EVAN NEUMANN.

01:11.066 --> 01:14.966
HE'S FROM CALIFORNIA.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.000
HERE HE IS DURING AN INTERVIEW

01:16.066 --> 01:17.066
WITH STATE MEDIA IN BELARUS.

01:17.133 --> 01:18.166
NEUMANN CLAIMS HE'S INNOCENT AND

01:18.233 --> 01:19.366
A VICTIM OF POLITICAL

01:19.433 --> 01:20.833
PERSECUTION.

01:20.900 --> 01:22.766
>> John: OH, GREAT IDEA, EVAN!

01:22.833 --> 01:24.366
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT POLITICAL

01:24.433 --> 01:25.866
PERSECUTION, SO YOU GO TO

01:25.933 --> 01:27.466
BELARUS, A COUNTRY RUN BY A MAN

01:27.533 --> 01:28.433
WHO CALLS HIMSELF "THE LAST AND

01:28.500 --> 01:30.933
ONLY DICTATOR IN EUROPE."

01:31.000 --> 01:31.900
YOU CAN READ ALL ABOUT THE

FREE-FLOWING EXCHANGE OF IDEAS

01:32.733 --> 01:34.866

"REDACTED: MAGAZINE" AND

"ALL PRAISE OUR GLORIOUS LEADER

01:41.000 --> 01:41.733
WHO ISN'T BALD QUARTERLY."

01:41.800 --> 01:42.666
NOW, OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN THE

01:42.733 --> 01:43.300
INSURRECTION HAVE BEEN FACING

01:43.366 --> 01:44.300
CONSEQUENCES.

01:44.366 --> 01:45.500
THE QANON SHAMAN -- A NAME I

01:45.566 --> 01:47.066
STILL CANNOT BELIEVE I HAVE TO

01:47.133 --> 01:48.333
SAY OUT LOUD -- IS AWAITING

01:48.400 --> 01:48.866
SENTENCING AFTER PLEADING

01:48.933 --> 01:50.800
GUILTY.

01:50.866 --> 01:52.366
AND THEN THERE'S JENNA RYAN, A

01:52.433 --> 01:53.600
TEXAS REAL ESTATE AGENT WHO

01:53.666 --> 01:55.200
ENTERED THE CAPITOL AND LATER

01:55.266 --> 01:56.733
GOT ATTENTION FOR TWEETING,

01:56.800 --> 02:00.600
"DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO JAIL.

02:00.666 --> 02:02.033
SORRY, I HAVE BLONDE HAIR,

02:02.100 --> 02:02.700
WHITE SKIN, A GREAT JOB, A GREAT

02:02.766 --> 02:03.633
FUTURE, AND I'M NOT GOING TO

02:03.700 --> 02:04.400
JAIL."

02:04.466 --> 02:06.333
WHICH IS, ON ONE HAND, A

02:06.400 --> 02:07.233
DANGEROUSLY BRAZEN TWEET, BUT,

02:07.300 --> 02:08.533
ON THE OTHER, A PRETTY GREAT

02:08.600 --> 02:10.433
"REAL HOUSEWIVES" CATCHPHRASE.

02:10.500 --> 02:11.833
"I HAVE BLONDE HAIR, WHITE SKIN,

02:11.900 --> 02:13.066
AND I'M NOT GOING TO JAIL."

02:13.133 --> 02:14.600
SHE'S THE NEW ERIKA JAYNE, AND I

02:14.666 --> 02:16.300
DON'T SAY THAT LIGHTLY.

02:16.366 --> 02:17.766
BUT TO BE FAIR, JENNA RYAN WAS

02:17.833 --> 02:18.800
RIGHT.

02:18.866 --> 02:19.766
SHE'S NOT GOING TO JAIL.

02:19.833 --> 02:21.066
BECAUSE SHE'S ACTUALLY GOING TO

02:21.133 --> 02:23.066
PRISON.

02:23.133 --> 02:24.633
EARLIER THIS MONTH, SHE WAS

02:24.700 --> 02:25.700
SENTENCED TO 60 DAYS BEHIND

02:25.766 --> 02:27.466
BARS, AND THIS WEEK, SHE SAT

02:27.533 --> 02:28.733
DOWN WITH LOCAL NEWS TO MAKE IT

02:28.800 --> 02:29.766
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR SHE'S LEARNED

02:29.833 --> 02:32.233
NOTHING FROM THIS.

02:32.300 --> 02:33.766
>> RYAN FLEW WITH FRIENDS ON A

02:33.833 --> 02:35.066
PRIVATE PLANE TO THE

02:35.133 --> 02:36.766
STOP THE STEAL RALLY IN DC

02:36.833 --> 02:38.633
BEFORE GOING BACK TO HER HOTEL.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.200
BUT WHILE WATCHING NEWS

02:40.266 --> 02:41.633
COVERAGE, SHE DECIDED TO GO BACK

02:41.700 --> 02:43.100
AND POSTED A VIDEO SAYING SHE

02:43.166 --> 02:45.100
WAS GOING TO STORM THE CAPITOL.

02:45.166 --> 02:45.933
>> SO I WAS JUST LIKE,

02:46.000 --> 02:47.033
"WE'RE STORMING THE CAPITOL!"

02:47.100 --> 02:48.200
AND I MEANT WE'RE STORMING WITH

02:48.266 --> 02:50.200
OUR WORDS, AND OUR -- WE'RE

02:50.266 --> 02:51.966
GOING DOWN THERE TO TELL THEM,

02:52.033 --> 02:53.066
YOU KNOW, AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S

02:53.133 --> 02:53.866
FREE SPEECH.

02:53.933 --> 02:54.966
YOU KNOW WHAT, WE ARE ARMED AND

02:55.033 --> 02:56.600
DANGEROUS!

02:56.666 --> 02:58.366
THIS IS THE BEGINNING!

02:58.433 --> 03:00.233
>> John: WHAT ARE YOU

03:00.300 --> 03:01.533
TALKING ABOUT, YOU

03:01.600 --> 03:02.633
MARJORIE TAYLOR WANNA-GREENE?

03:02.700 --> 03:03.700
"STORMING WITH WORDS"?

03:03.766 --> 03:05.100
THAT'S NOT A THING.

03:05.166 --> 03:06.166
THAT'S NEVER BEEN A THING.

03:06.233 --> 03:08.133
IF YOU LOOK UP "THING" IN THE

03:08.200 --> 03:10.300
DICTIONARY, I'M PRETTY SURE IT

03:10.366 --> 03:12.633
SAYS, "NOT STORMING WITH WORDS."

03:12.700 --> 03:14.133
JENNA ALSO OUTLINED HOW SHE'S

03:14.200 --> 03:15.066
PREPARING FOR HER 60-DAY

03:15.133 --> 03:16.266
SENTENCE, WHICH IS, IF NOTHING

03:16.333 --> 03:18.700
ELSE, ON BRAND.

03:18.766 --> 03:20.000
>> IT'S ALL YOU CAN THINK ABOUT.

03:20.066 --> 03:21.666
I'M WATCHING ALL THE YOUTUBE

03:21.733 --> 03:23.900
VIDEOS ON HOW PRISON IS, HOW TO

03:23.966 --> 03:26.100
GO TO PRISON, WHAT TO DO.

03:26.166 --> 03:27.166
>> John: ALL RIGHT, I DON'T KNOW

03:27.233 --> 03:29.233
WHAT'S WEIRDER, THAT SHE SEEMS

03:29.300 --> 03:30.200
SO CASUAL OR THAT AN ADULT HAS

03:30.266 --> 03:31.166
TO GO TO YOUTUBE TO LEARN

03:31.233 --> 03:32.066
"HOW PRISON IS."

03:32.133 --> 03:33.533
I'LL TELL YOU:

03:33.600 --> 03:36.000
IT'S BAD, JENNA!

03:36.066 --> 03:37.966
REALLY BAD.

03:38.033 --> 03:38.900
ALSO, THAT'S NOT WHAT YOUTUBE

03:38.966 --> 03:41.133
SHOULD BE FOR.

03:41.200 --> 03:41.866
YOUTUBE'S FOR WATCHING

03:41.933 --> 03:42.666
2-MINUTE MOVIE TRAILERS,

03:42.733 --> 03:43.400
40-MINUTE EXPLAINER VIDEOS

03:43.466 --> 03:44.800
POINTING OUT ALL THE EASTER EGGS

03:44.866 --> 03:45.966
YOU MISSED IN THAT TRAILER, AND

03:46.033 --> 03:46.533
TIKTOK COMPILATIONS BECAUSE

03:46.600 --> 03:47.533
YOU'RE TOO OLD TO LEARN TIKTOK

03:47.600 --> 03:48.233
BUT TOO DESPERATE TO LET IT PASS

03:48.300 --> 03:52.666
YOU BY COMPLETELY.

03:52.733 --> 03:53.900
THAT'S WHAT YOUTUBE IS FOR.

03:54.000 --> 03:54.866
THAT, AND OF COURSE, MELTING

03:54.933 --> 03:56.600
PEOPLE'S BRAINS WITH UTTER

03:56.666 --> 03:58.033
NONSENSE.

03:58.100 --> 03:59.333
SPEAKING OF WHICH, IN THE LEAST

03:59.400 --> 04:00.600
SURPRISING MOVE IMAGINABLE,

04:00.666 --> 04:01.900
JENNA RYAN LAUNCHED A PODCAST ON

04:01.966 --> 04:03.666
HER YOUTUBE CHANNEL THIS WEEK.

04:03.733 --> 04:05.233
HERE IS A CLIP FROM MONDAY'S

04:05.300 --> 04:07.266
FIRST EPISODE.

04:07.333 --> 04:08.633
>> I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO COME

04:08.700 --> 04:09.666
TO MY CHANNEL AND LISTEN TO WHAT

04:09.733 --> 04:11.133
I HAVE TO SAY AND BE WELL

04:11.200 --> 04:12.266
CAUGHT-UP ON ALTERNATIVE NEWS.

04:12.333 --> 04:15.800
I JUST MADE THAT UP.

04:15.866 --> 04:17.200
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

04:17.266 --> 04:20.100
>> John: WE'RE IN HELL.

04:20.166 --> 04:21.966
BUT RYAN'S NOT ALONE IN NOT

04:22.033 --> 04:23.100
LEARNING IMPORTANT LESSONS FROM

04:23.166 --> 04:25.000
JANUARY 6 -- TAKE REPRESENTATIVE

04:25.066 --> 04:26.100
PAUL GOSAR, WHO BRAGGED THAT HE

04:26.166 --> 04:28.000
HELPED ORGANIZE THE VERY FIRST

04:28.066 --> 04:31.733
STOP THE STEAL RALLY IN ARIZONA,

04:31.800 --> 04:32.400
AND TWEETED VARIOUS VERSIONS OF

04:32.466 --> 04:33.333
STOP THE STEAL AT LEAST 25 TIMES

04:33.400 --> 04:33.900
IN THE RUN-UP TO THE

04:33.966 --> 04:35.600
INSURRECTION.

04:35.666 --> 04:36.833
GOSAR'S STILL VERY MUCH IN

04:36.900 --> 04:37.566
CONGRESS -- AND JUST THIS WEEK

04:37.633 --> 04:39.133
WAS CRITICIZED FOR PULLING THIS

04:39.200 --> 04:40.700
SHIT.

04:40.766 --> 04:42.166
>> A U.S. CONGRESSMAN IS UNDER

04:42.233 --> 04:43.666
FIRE TODAY FOR POSTING A VIDEO

04:43.733 --> 04:45.300
WHICH SIMULATES HIM KILLING ONE

04:45.366 --> 04:47.133
OF HIS COLLEAGUES.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.866
REPUBLICAN PAUL GOSAR FROM

04:48.933 --> 04:50.666
ARIZONA SHARED THE CLIP ON

04:50.733 --> 04:51.900
SOCIAL MEDIA, WHICH WAS ALTERED

04:51.966 --> 04:53.033
FROM A POPULAR ANIME SERIES.

04:53.100 --> 04:54.333
IN IT, A CARTOON FIGURE WITH HIS

04:54.400 --> 04:56.333
FACE ATTACKS A FIGURE WITH THE

04:56.400 --> 04:57.800
FACE OF DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN

04:57.866 --> 05:00.700
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ.

05:00.766 --> 05:02.466
IT ALSO APPEARS TO GO AFTER

05:02.533 --> 05:04.700
PRESIDENT BIDEN WITH SWORDS.

05:04.766 --> 05:07.100
>> John: OKAY, THERE IS CLEARLY

05:07.166 --> 05:08.133
A LOT GOING ON THERE.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.466
BUT JUST IN TERMS OF SHEER

05:09.533 --> 05:10.733
WEIRDNESS, I'M NOT SURE I

05:10.800 --> 05:12.133
CAN GET OVER THE IDEA THAT

05:12.200 --> 05:13.933
PAUL GOSAR -- THIS GUY -- IS IN

05:14.000 --> 05:16.266
ANY WAY FAMILIAR WITH ANIME.

05:16.333 --> 05:17.333
WHEN I SEE PAUL GOSAR,

05:17.400 --> 05:18.400
I THINK OF A FEW THINGS.

05:18.466 --> 05:19.766
I THINK ASSHOLE, TROLL,

05:19.833 --> 05:21.166
PLUCKED SAM THE EAGLE,

05:21.233 --> 05:21.966
GUY WHO LOOKS LIKE HE

05:22.033 --> 05:22.800
OCCASIONALLY GOOGLES "WHY AREN'T

05:22.866 --> 05:25.133
THERE MORE BREAKFAST SOUPS?"

05:25.200 --> 05:26.033
BUT ANIME FAN?

05:26.100 --> 05:28.566
THIS GUY?

05:28.633 --> 05:30.333
SHAME ON ME FOR JUDGING A BOOK

05:30.400 --> 05:31.033
BY ITS COVER.

05:31.100 --> 05:32.200
PLEASE CARRY ON AND ENJOY

05:32.266 --> 05:33.066
"NEON GENESIS EVANGELION,"

05:33.133 --> 05:34.500
SUBS NOT DUBS TILL THE DAY THEY

05:34.566 --> 05:36.333
PUT YOU IN THE GROUND.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.200
BUT, LOOK, INSTEAD OF

05:38.266 --> 05:40.333
APOLOGIZING, GOSAR DOUBLED DOWN,

05:40.400 --> 05:41.733
TWEETING THIS MEME IN RESPONSE

05:41.800 --> 05:43.000
SAYING, "IT'S A CARTOON, RELAX."

05:43.066 --> 05:44.500
AND LOOK, IT IS.

05:44.566 --> 05:45.933
KIND OF.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.933
BECAUSE ON ONE HAND, IT'D BE

05:49.000 --> 05:50.066
DISINGENUOUS OF ME TO PRETEND

05:50.133 --> 05:51.900
THAT GOSAR TWEETING A POORLY

05:51.966 --> 05:52.700
EDITED ANIME VIDEO MEANT HE WAS

05:52.766 --> 05:54.100
GOING TO PHYSICALLY ATTACK AOC.

05:54.166 --> 05:55.400
I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO DO

05:55.466 --> 05:56.833
THAT, NOT LEAST BECAUSE IF HE

05:56.900 --> 06:00.566
DID, HE'D LOSE.

06:00.633 --> 06:01.566
BUT ALSO, JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING

06:01.633 --> 06:02.400
ISN'T A LITERAL THREAT DOESN'T

06:02.466 --> 06:04.266
MEAN IT CAN'T STILL INSPIRE

06:04.333 --> 06:06.900
REAL WORLD HARM.

06:06.966 --> 06:07.766
BECAUSE IF WE'VE LEARNED

06:07.833 --> 06:09.000
ANYTHING FROM JANUARY 6TH, AND

06:09.066 --> 06:10.766
IT SEEMS WE HAVE NOT LEARNED

06:10.833 --> 06:11.566
NEARLY ENOUGH, IT'S THAT IT'S

06:11.633 --> 06:12.733
VERY EASY FOR A JOKE TO BECOME

06:12.800 --> 06:14.066
REALITY, AND THAT A TROUBLING

06:14.133 --> 06:16.066
NUMBER OF PEOPLE DON'T SEEM TO

06:16.133 --> 06:17.033
UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE

06:17.100 --> 06:18.533
BETWEEN "STORMING THE CAPITOL"

06:18.600 --> 06:21.733
METAPHORICALLY AND PHYSICALLY.

06:21.800 --> 06:22.800
AND KNOWING FULL WELL THAT THIS

06:22.866 --> 06:24.333
VIDEO MIGHT NOW SHOW UP IF

06:24.400 --> 06:25.866
JENNA RYAN SEARCHES YOUTUBE FOR

06:52.500 --> 06:53.733
THE MANY QUESTIONS OF

06:53.800 --> 06:54.766
"FOX AND FRIENDS"

06:54.833 --> 06:56.633
BRIAN KILMEADE.

06:56.700 --> 06:57.900
>> HOW DO DINERS HAVE 20 PAGES

06:57.966 --> 07:01.933
IN THEIR MENU?

07:02.000 --> 07:03.266
THEY COULD MAKE ANYTHING.

07:03.333 --> 07:04.100
HOW DO THEY DO THAT?

07:04.166 --> 07:04.700
WHY DO ALL NEWBORNS HAVE THAT

07:04.766 --> 07:05.933
SAME BLANKET?

07:06.000 --> 07:06.966
WHAT GREAT AMERICAN DECIDED THAT

07:07.033 --> 07:07.933
YOU NEEDED A BUN WITH A HOT DOG,

07:08.000 --> 07:12.233
DO YOU KNOW?

07:12.300 --> 07:12.966
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

07:13.033 --> 07:13.466
SOULCYCLE AND SPINNING?

07:13.533 --> 07:14.700
DO YOU KNOW?

07:14.766 --> 07:16.066
WHAT DO BEARS EAT?

07:16.133 --> 07:17.333
IS IT SQUIRRELS?

07:17.400 --> 07:18.233
DO YOU THINK SHARKS KNOW IT IS

07:18.300 --> 07:21.633
SHARK WEEK?

07:21.700 --> 07:22.566
WHAT PART OF THE COW IS THE

07:22.633 --> 07:22.766
SKIRT?

07:22.833 --> 07:23.300
IT MAKES YOU QUESTION

07:23.366 --> 07:24.633
EVERYTHING, LIKE, WHY WAS IT

07:24.700 --> 07:25.266
EVER THE INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF

07:25.333 --> 07:27.033
PANCAKES?

07:27.100 --> 07:28.633
WHAT IF A TREE COULD JUST HOVER?

07:28.700 --> 07:31.966
IS SPAM MEAT?

07:32.033 --> 07:33.233
WHAT'S THIS CALLED?

07:33.300 --> 07:33.866
WHY ARE TURNIPS SO ARE SEASONAL.

07:33.933 --> 07:34.933
TURNIPS.

07:35.000 --> 07:35.900
DO YOU HAVE TURNIPS MORE THAN

07:35.966 --> 07:36.533
ONCE A YEAR?

07:36.600 --> 07:37.066
WHY DON'T WE HAVE TURNIPS

07:37.133 --> 07:38.266
YEAR-ROUND?

07:38.333 --> 07:38.933
>> WE DO.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.300
>> YOU DO?

07:42.366 --> 07:43.333
>> SURE.

07:43.400 --> 07:44.433
>> John: MOVING ON.

07:44.500 --> 07:45.400
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

07:45.466 --> 07:46.433
UNIONS.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.566
THE INSTITUTIONS THAT BROUGHT US

07:47.633 --> 07:48.800
THE WEEKEND, THE MIDDLE CLASS,

07:48.866 --> 07:49.500
AND -- IN THE CASE OF THE

07:49.566 --> 07:50.233
INTERNATIONAL LADIES GARMENT

07:50.300 --> 07:51.233
WORKERS UNION -- AN ABSOLUTE

07:51.300 --> 07:53.333
BANGER OF A SONG.

07:53.400 --> 08:01.933
AND BEFORE WE PLAY THIS, I HAVE

08:02.000 --> 08:02.900
A FAVORITE SINGER HERE, SEE IF

08:41.600 --> 08:42.166
BARELY PAUSE TO WONDER HOW MANY

08:42.233 --> 08:42.833
OF THEM ARE DEAD NOW.

08:42.900 --> 08:43.500
AND BY THE WAY, YES,

08:43.566 --> 08:44.533
MY FAVORITE SINGER IS THE

08:44.600 --> 08:45.766
"AND RUN THE HOUSE" LADY.

08:45.833 --> 08:48.866
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO GETS TO

08:48.933 --> 08:49.666
HAVE A DRAMATIC ENTRANCE.

08:49.733 --> 08:50.700
ALSO, SHE'S GOT A FABULOUS

08:50.766 --> 08:51.666
MUSHROOM HAIRCUT, WIDE LAPELS,

08:51.733 --> 08:56.466
AND THE VOICE OF AN ANGEL.

08:56.533 --> 08:58.800
EVERY SINGER IN THAT SONG IS A

08:58.866 --> 09:00.433
STAR, BUT SHE IS THE BRIGHTEST

09:00.500 --> 09:00.766
IN THE GALAXY.

09:00.833 --> 09:01.333
NOW, THAT AD, IF IT WEREN'T

09:01.400 --> 09:02.166
OBVIOUS FROM EVERY SINGLE THING

09:02.233 --> 09:03.233
ABOUT IT, IS FROM THE EARLY

09:03.300 --> 09:04.300
1980s, AND UNFORTUNATELY, SINCE

09:04.366 --> 09:05.766
THEN, UNION MEMBERSHIP HAS

09:05.833 --> 09:07.900
DECLINED CONSIDERABLY.

09:07.966 --> 09:10.000
TODAY, JUST OVER 10% OF AMERICAN

09:10.066 --> 09:12.133
WORKERS BELONG TO A UNION.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.666
THAT'S JUST HALF THE RATE IT WAS

09:13.733 --> 09:14.866
IN 1983, MEANING WE'RE CURRENTLY

09:14.933 --> 09:16.733
LIVING IN ONE OF THE WORST TIMES

09:16.800 --> 09:18.066
FOR ORGANIZED LABOR IN OUR

09:18.133 --> 09:19.700
COUNTRY'S HISTORY.

09:19.766 --> 09:21.200
AND IT'S NOT LIKE THE DEMAND

09:21.266 --> 09:22.100
ISN'T THERE:

09:22.166 --> 09:24.033
NEARLY HALF OF NON-UNION WORKERS

09:24.100 --> 09:25.633
SAY THEY'D LIKE TO BE IN A

09:25.700 --> 09:26.900
UNION.

09:26.966 --> 09:28.633
AND A LOT OF WORKPLACES DO SEEM

09:28.700 --> 09:29.600
LIKE A NATURAL FIT FOR ONE.

09:29.666 --> 09:30.833
TAKE AMAZON.

09:30.900 --> 09:32.666
YOU'VE LIKELY HEARD THE INFAMOUS

09:32.733 --> 09:33.466
STORIES OF DRIVERS FOR THE

09:33.533 --> 09:34.700
COMPANY BEING FORCED TO PEE

09:34.766 --> 09:36.133
IN BOTTLES IN ORDER TO MAKE

09:36.200 --> 09:37.500
QUOTAS -- STORIES THAT AMAZON

09:37.566 --> 09:39.000
INITIALLY DENIED, THEN

09:39.066 --> 09:40.566
APOLOGIZED FOR DENYING, FINALLY

09:40.633 --> 09:41.533
ADMITTING THAT, YEAH, OKAY,

09:41.600 --> 09:43.100
THEIR DRIVERS DO SOMETIMES HAVE

09:43.166 --> 09:44.666
TO PISS IN BOTTLES.

09:44.733 --> 09:47.700
IT'S LIKE THE OLD ADAGE:

09:47.766 --> 09:48.966
"'TIS BETTER TO SEEK FORGIVENESS

09:49.033 --> 09:49.600
THAN PERMISSION, UNLESS THIS IS

09:49.666 --> 09:50.600
ABOUT PISS BOTTLES, IN WHICH

09:50.666 --> 09:51.500
CASE, TAKE A LOOK AT YOURSELF,

09:51.566 --> 09:52.900
MAN, WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING."

09:52.966 --> 09:55.366
MAHATMA GANDHI.

09:55.433 --> 09:57.100
AND YET, DESPITE THAT AND OTHER

09:57.166 --> 09:58.166
REPORTS OF ABYSMAL WORKING

09:58.233 --> 10:00.033
CONDITIONS, EARLIER THIS YEAR AN

10:00.100 --> 10:01.066
ORGANIZING DRIVE FOR AMAZON

10:01.133 --> 10:02.433
WAREHOUSE WORKERS IN BESSEMER,

10:02.500 --> 10:04.166
ALABAMA, WAS VOTED DOWN BY MORE

10:04.233 --> 10:05.733
THAN TWO TO ONE.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.333
WHICH MAY SEEM LIKE A CLEAR-CUT

10:07.400 --> 10:09.266
CASE OF WORKERS DECIDING FOR

10:09.333 --> 10:12.233
THEMSELVES TO REJECT A UNION,

10:12.300 --> 10:14.233
BUT IT'S A LOT MORE COMPLICATED

10:14.300 --> 10:15.533
THAN THAT, BECAUSE IF YOU'VE

10:15.600 --> 10:16.733
NEVER BEEN THROUGH A

10:16.800 --> 10:18.733
UNION-ORGANIZING DRIVE YOURSELF,

10:18.800 --> 10:19.800
YOU MIGHT ASSUME A UNION VOTE IS

10:19.866 --> 10:21.066
A COMPLETELY FREE AND FAIR

10:21.133 --> 10:22.466
ELECTION.

10:22.533 --> 10:23.633
THAT'S AN ILLUSION FED BY

10:23.700 --> 10:24.900
EXECUTIVES LIKE JEFF BEZOS,

10:24.966 --> 10:26.700
AMERICA'S LEAST-INSPIRING

10:26.766 --> 10:28.500
ASTRONAUT, THROUGH STATEMENTS

10:28.566 --> 10:30.100
LIKE THIS.

10:30.166 --> 10:31.666
>> WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE NEED

10:31.733 --> 10:33.933
A UNION TO BE AN INTERMEDIARY

10:34.033 --> 10:36.666
BETWEEN US AND OUR EMPLOYEES

10:36.733 --> 10:37.433
BUT, OF COURSE, AT THE END OF

10:37.500 --> 10:38.133
THE DAY, IT'S ALWAYS THE

10:38.200 --> 10:41.566
EMPLOYEES' CHOICE.

10:41.633 --> 10:42.400
AND -- AND THAT'S HOW IT

10:42.466 --> 10:42.966
SHOULD BE.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.833
>> John: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

10:44.900 --> 10:45.800
BUT I'M PERSONALLY NOT COMFORTED

10:45.866 --> 10:46.400
BY HEARING ONE OF THE RICHEST

10:46.466 --> 10:48.100
MEN ON EARTH SAY "IT'S YOUR

10:48.166 --> 10:48.766
CHOICE."

10:48.833 --> 10:49.866
NO MATTER THE CONTEXT, ALL I CAN

10:49.933 --> 10:51.666
HEAR IS "SPEAR OR ARROW -- HOW

10:51.733 --> 10:53.566
WOULD YOU PREFER TO BE HUNTED?

10:53.633 --> 10:56.866
IT'S YOUR CHOICE."

10:56.933 --> 10:58.066
BUT IT IS WORTH KNOWING JUST HOW

10:58.133 --> 10:58.800
MANY WAYS AMAZON AND MANY

10:58.866 --> 10:59.466
OTHER COMPANIES TRY TO

10:59.533 --> 11:01.333
INFLUENCE THEIR EMPLOYEES'

11:01.400 --> 11:02.633
CHOICE.

11:02.700 --> 11:03.566
BECAUSE THEY CAN EXERT A HUGE

11:03.633 --> 11:05.300
AMOUNT OF PRESSURE.

11:05.366 --> 11:06.766
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT

11:06.833 --> 11:08.166
UNION-BUSTING -- WHAT IT IS,

11:08.233 --> 11:09.800
HOW IT WORKS, AND HOW FEW

11:09.866 --> 11:11.300
CONSEQUENCES COMPANIES FACE FOR

11:11.366 --> 11:12.300
DOING IT.

11:12.366 --> 11:13.766
AND LET'S START WITH A VERY

11:13.833 --> 11:14.966
BASIC BREAKDOWN OF HOW A UNION

11:15.033 --> 11:16.466
DRIVE WORKS.

11:16.533 --> 11:18.266
THE FIRST THING TO KNOW IS THAT

11:18.333 --> 11:19.700
ANY EMPLOYER MAY RECOGNIZE A

11:19.766 --> 11:21.833
UNION BASED SOLELY ON MAJORITY

11:21.900 --> 11:23.600
SUPPORT.

11:23.666 --> 11:24.733
SO THEY CAN LET EMPLOYEES

11:24.800 --> 11:26.266
UNIONIZE IMMEDIATELY, BUT

11:26.333 --> 11:28.766
THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO DO THAT,

11:28.833 --> 11:30.100
UNLESS IT'S BEEN CHOSEN THROUGH

11:30.166 --> 11:31.400
A SECRET BALLOT VOTE.

11:31.466 --> 11:33.366
SO UNSURPRISINGLY, THAT'S HOW

11:33.433 --> 11:34.800
MOST UNIONS END UP GETTING

11:34.866 --> 11:36.133
RECOGNIZED.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.400
AND THE FIRST KEY STEP IN

11:37.466 --> 11:38.800
UNION-BUSTING IS PREVENTING

11:38.866 --> 11:41.300
THINGS FROM EVER REACHING THAT

11:41.366 --> 11:43.133
POINT.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.200
BECAUSE FOR AN ELECTION TO

11:44.266 --> 11:45.400
HAPPEN AT ALL, 30% OF WORKERS

11:45.466 --> 11:46.366
MUST SIGN A UNION CARD,

11:46.433 --> 11:47.800
EXPRESSING AN INITIAL INTEREST

11:47.866 --> 11:49.400
IN UNION REPRESENTATION.

11:49.466 --> 11:50.633
BUT AMAZON, FOR INSTANCE, HAS

11:50.700 --> 11:52.233
INSTRUCTED ITS MANAGERS TO BE ON

11:52.300 --> 11:54.466
HIGH ALERT FOR THE SLIGHTEST

11:54.533 --> 11:55.733
SIGN THAT THAT MIGHT HAPPEN --

11:55.800 --> 11:57.100
AS THIS LEAKED INTERNAL VIDEO

11:57.166 --> 11:59.100
SHOWS:

11:59.166 --> 12:00.933
>> IF YOU SEE WARNING SIGNS OF

12:01.000 --> 12:02.366
POTENTIAL ORGANIZING, NOTIFY

12:02.433 --> 12:03.300
YOUR BUILDING HRM AND GM SITE

12:03.366 --> 12:04.700
LEADER IMMEDIATELY.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.633
THE MOST OBVIOUS SIGNS WOULD

12:06.700 --> 12:09.800
INCLUDE USE OF WORDS ASSOCIATED

12:09.866 --> 12:10.700
WITH UNIONS OR UNION-LED

12:10.766 --> 12:11.666
MOVEMENTS LIKE "LIVING WAGE" OR

12:11.733 --> 12:12.700
"STEWARD."

12:12.766 --> 12:15.033
>> John: WOW.

12:15.100 --> 12:17.300
SET ASIDE HOW COMPLETELY

12:17.366 --> 12:18.700
MASK-OFF IT IS TO TREAT THE

12:18.766 --> 12:20.600
PHRASE "LIVING WAGE" LIKE THE

12:20.666 --> 12:22.533
FIRST WARNING SIGN OF A STROKE,

12:22.600 --> 12:24.433
YOU'D ALSO THINK A NEARLY

12:24.500 --> 12:25.433
$2 TRILLION COMPANY LIKE AMAZON

12:25.500 --> 12:26.633
COULD SPRING FOR BETTER

12:26.700 --> 12:29.133
ANIMATION THAN JIBJAB.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.433
BUT IF ENOUGH WORKERS DO SIGN

12:30.500 --> 12:31.366
CARDS, THE ELECTION PROCESS IS

12:31.433 --> 12:32.733
THEN UNDERWAY.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.600
AND IN THAT PROCESS, COMPANIES

12:34.666 --> 12:37.366
HAVE SOME PRETTY HUGE

12:37.433 --> 12:38.266
ADVANTAGES.

12:38.333 --> 12:39.233
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY, WHEN YOU'RE

12:39.300 --> 12:40.266
ON THEIR PREMISES, THEY HAVE

12:40.333 --> 12:41.200
UNFETTERED ACCESS TO YOU, WHILE

12:41.266 --> 12:42.033
ALSO HAVING THE ABILITY TO KEEP

12:42.100 --> 12:45.000
UNION REPS OUT.

12:45.066 --> 12:46.033
AND MANY COMPANIES TAKE FULL

12:46.100 --> 12:48.400
ADVANTAGE OF THAT ACCESS.

12:48.466 --> 12:49.433
AMAZON, FOR INSTANCE, INUNDATED

12:49.500 --> 12:51.100
WORKERS WITH ANTI-UNION SIGNS

12:51.166 --> 12:53.033
ALL OVER THEIR WORKPLACE -- EVEN

12:53.100 --> 12:54.633
PUTTING THEM INSIDE BATHROOM

12:54.700 --> 12:56.633
STALLS.

12:56.700 --> 12:57.666
THEY ALSO USED WORKERS' CONTACT

12:57.733 --> 12:58.966
INFO TO SEND MULTIPLE ANTI-UNION

12:59.033 --> 13:02.300
TEXT MESSAGES TO THEM PER DAY.

13:02.366 --> 13:03.566
AND HELD MANDATORY MEETINGS THAT

13:03.633 --> 13:06.133
SEEMED DESIGNED TO SPREAD FEAR.

13:06.200 --> 13:07.533
>> THEY HAD SOMEBODY WHO WAS

13:07.600 --> 13:09.133
LIKE THEIR -- THE CAPTAIN OF THE

13:09.200 --> 13:10.800
UNION BUSTING WHO WOULD COME

13:10.866 --> 13:12.033
DOWN AND TEACH, LIKE --

13:12.100 --> 13:13.166
>> WHAT WAS THE OFFICIAL TITLE

13:13.233 --> 13:15.866
OF THE CLASS?

13:15.933 --> 13:16.466
>> THEY JUST CALLED IT, LIKE,

13:16.533 --> 13:17.066
UNION TRAINING.

13:17.133 --> 13:17.833
THAT'S IT.

13:17.900 --> 13:18.733
WHICH IS FUNNY BECAUSE IT'S NOT

13:18.800 --> 13:20.800
UNION TRAINING.

13:20.866 --> 13:21.633
IT'S ANTI -- IT'S

13:21.700 --> 13:27.500
UNION-BUSTING 101.

13:27.566 --> 13:28.000
>> John: RIGHT.

13:28.066 --> 13:28.733
IT'S NOT "UNION TRAINING" IF THE

13:28.800 --> 13:29.500
EXPLICIT GOAL IS TO KILL THE

13:29.566 --> 13:30.033
UNION.

13:30.100 --> 13:30.933
IT WOULD BE LIKE TAKING

13:31.000 --> 13:31.566
A DOG TRAINING CLASS FROM

13:31.633 --> 13:32.333
CRUELLA DE VIL.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.933
ALTHOUGH, NO, NOT THE ONE THAT'S

13:34.000 --> 13:34.766
A MISUNDERSTOOD BOHEMIAN OR

13:34.833 --> 13:35.833
WHATEVER, I'M TALKING ABOUT THE

13:35.900 --> 13:37.066
REAL CRUELLA.

13:37.133 --> 13:38.300
YEAH, THAT ONE.

13:38.366 --> 13:39.466
THE ORIGINAL DOGICIDAL

13:39.533 --> 13:41.966
BAD BITCH.

13:42.033 --> 13:43.500
THESE MANDATORY PROPAGANDA

13:43.566 --> 13:44.700
SESSIONS ARE CALLED

13:44.766 --> 13:47.066
"CAPTIVE AUDIENCE MEETINGS," AND

13:47.133 --> 13:48.466
MOST AMAZON WORKERS AT BESSEMER

13:48.533 --> 13:50.766
WERE HAVING TO ATTEND AT LEAST

13:50.833 --> 13:51.700
TWO PER WEEK.

13:51.766 --> 13:53.666
AND THAT'S NOT UNCOMMON --

13:53.733 --> 13:54.766
NEARLY 90% OF EMPLOYERS FACING

13:54.833 --> 13:57.100
UNION CAMPAIGNS HOLD CAPTIVE

13:57.166 --> 13:58.633
AUDIENCE MEETINGS.

13:58.700 --> 14:00.033
RIGHT NOW, STARBUCKS IS FACING A

14:00.100 --> 14:01.733
UNION DRIVE AT SIX OF ITS STORES

14:01.800 --> 14:04.666
IN BUFFALO, AND IT'S BEEN DOING

14:04.733 --> 14:05.333
EVERYTHING YOU'VE JUST SEEN --

14:05.400 --> 14:06.166
SENDING ANTI-UNION TEXT

14:06.233 --> 14:07.133
MESSAGES, PUTTING UP SIGNS, AND

14:07.200 --> 14:08.066
HOLDING CAPTIVE AUDIENCE

14:08.133 --> 14:09.633
MEETINGS.

14:09.700 --> 14:11.666
AND IT MAY BE NO COINCIDENCE

14:11.733 --> 14:12.766
THAT AMAZON'S AND STARBUCKS'

14:12.833 --> 14:14.700
TACTICS ARE PRETTY SIMILAR,

14:14.766 --> 14:16.066
BECAUSE BOTH HIRED UNION-BUSTING

14:16.133 --> 14:17.366
LAW FIRMS AND CONSULTANTS TO

14:17.433 --> 14:24.800
HELP THEM WITH THEIR CAMPAIGNS.

14:24.866 --> 14:27.133
WHICH IS NOT UNUSUAL.

14:27.200 --> 14:27.633
UNION-BUSTING IS A WHOLE

14:27.700 --> 14:27.933
INDUSTRY.

14:28.033 --> 14:28.766
THERE ARE NOW ABOUT 2,000 OF

14:28.833 --> 14:30.466
THESE FIRMS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE

14:30.533 --> 14:30.933
EUPHEMISTIC NAMES LIKE

14:31.000 --> 14:32.433
"THE LABOR RELATIONS INSTITUTE."

14:32.500 --> 14:34.733
AND 75% OF COMPANIES FACING

14:34.800 --> 14:35.800
ORGANIZING DRIVES HIRE ONE,

14:35.866 --> 14:37.900
SPENDING NEARLY $340 MILLION ON

14:37.966 --> 14:39.266
THEM PER YEAR.

14:39.333 --> 14:40.700
AND THESE FIRMS OFFER DIFFERENT

14:40.766 --> 14:41.900
LEVELS OF SERVICES.

14:41.966 --> 14:43.100
FOR COMPANIES ON A BUDGET, SOME

14:43.166 --> 14:44.566
OFFER MASS-PRODUCED ANTI-UNION

14:44.633 --> 14:45.466
VIDEOS.

14:45.533 --> 14:46.833
YOU CAN EVEN BUY THIS ONE,

14:46.900 --> 14:49.000
FEATURING A CARTOONISHLY

14:49.066 --> 14:50.766
OVERBEARING UNION ORGANIZER,

14:50.833 --> 14:52.133
SHOT AGAINST A GREEN SCREEN, SO

14:52.200 --> 14:53.033
YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE IT BASED ON

14:53.100 --> 14:54.800
YOUR WORKPLACE.

14:54.866 --> 14:56.366
THEY EVEN PRODUCED SAMPLES OF

14:56.433 --> 14:57.766
WHAT THAT COULD LOOK LIKE:

14:57.833 --> 14:58.933
>> LISTEN, JUST SIGN THE CARD.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
ONCE A UNION GETS HERE, YOU

15:00.066 --> 15:03.100
WANNA BE ON THE GOOD SIDE.

15:03.166 --> 15:04.733
LISTEN, JUST SIGN THE CARD.

15:04.800 --> 15:05.533
ONCE A UNION GETS HERE, YOU

15:05.600 --> 15:08.433
WANNA BE ON THE GOOD SIDE.

15:08.500 --> 15:12.133
LISTEN, JUST SIGN THE CARD.

15:12.200 --> 15:12.966
ONCE A UNION GETS HERE, YOU

15:13.033 --> 15:13.633
WANNA BE ON THE GOOD SIDE.

15:13.700 --> 15:14.566
>> John: WELL, I'LL SAY THIS:

15:14.633 --> 15:15.700
AT LEAST THEY CHOSE OUTFITS

15:15.766 --> 15:17.200
THAT'D FIT IN ANY WORKPLACE,

15:17.266 --> 15:18.666
BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW EMPLOYEES IN

15:18.733 --> 15:19.800
BOTH CORPORATE OFFICES AND

15:19.866 --> 15:21.633
WAREHOUSES DRESS LIKE

15:21.700 --> 15:22.433
A COLLEGE FOOTBALL COACH

15:22.500 --> 15:23.633
WHOSE WIFE JUST LEFT HIM

15:23.700 --> 15:24.666
AND AN "AMERICA'S

15:24.733 --> 15:25.866
NEXT TOP MODEL" CONTESTANT

15:25.933 --> 15:27.733
BEFORE THE MAKEOVER.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.266
ALTHOUGH THE BACKDROPS CLEARLY

15:29.333 --> 15:30.533
COULD HAVE BEEN MORE CREATIVE.

15:30.600 --> 15:31.933
YOU'VE GOT A GREEN SCREEN.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.466
THE WORLD'S YOUR OYSTER.

15:35.533 --> 15:36.866
WHY NOT SHOW EVIL UNIONIZERS

15:36.933 --> 15:38.500
MOBILIZING ON A ROLLER COASTER

15:38.566 --> 15:41.066
OR ON A TROPICAL GETAWAY OR ON

15:41.133 --> 15:43.933
THE DESERT PLANET OF ARRAKIS?

15:44.000 --> 15:45.233
IF YOU'RE GOING TO FORCE

15:45.300 --> 15:45.966
EMPLOYEES TO WATCH YOUR

15:46.033 --> 15:47.066
BULLSHIT, AT LEAST TAKE THEM

15:47.133 --> 15:48.566
ON A COSMIC JOURNEY WITH

15:48.633 --> 15:51.633
SANDY SOFTBOY SPACE JESUS.

15:51.700 --> 15:52.966
BUT WHETHER IT'S COMING DIRECTLY

15:53.033 --> 15:54.800
FROM A COMPANY OR THROUGH AN

15:54.866 --> 15:57.533
OUTSIDE FIRM, ANTI-UNION

15:57.600 --> 15:59.000
CAMPAIGNS TEND TO FOLLOW A

15:59.066 --> 16:00.300
PRETTY BASIC PLAYBOOK, AND A

16:00.366 --> 16:02.000
GO-TO TACTIC IS TO HIGHLIGHT

16:02.066 --> 16:03.433
THAT UNIONS COLLECT DUES.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.400
IT'S A POINT DELTA AIRLINES

16:05.466 --> 16:10.100
MADE WHEN ITS EMPLOYEES WERE

16:10.166 --> 16:12.866
CONSIDERING UNIONIZING, AND THEY

16:12.933 --> 16:13.533
DID IT IN A

16:13.600 --> 16:14.133
PRETTY DICKISH WAY.

16:14.200 --> 16:14.933
>> DELTA AIRLINES CAUSING A LOT

16:15.000 --> 16:15.666
OF TURBULENCE ON THE GROUND

16:15.733 --> 16:16.300
AFTER IT TOLD EMPLOYEES TO BUY

16:16.366 --> 16:16.900
VIDEO GAMES INSTEAD OF

16:16.966 --> 16:17.833
UNIONIZING.

16:17.900 --> 16:19.266
ONE POSTER -- HERE IT IS -- SAYS

16:19.333 --> 16:20.166
"UNION DUES COST AROUND $700 A

16:20.233 --> 16:21.166
YEAR," AND THEN TELLS EMPLOYEES

16:21.233 --> 16:22.600
TO PUT THEIR MONEY TOWARDS A

16:22.666 --> 16:23.666
VIDEO GAME SYSTEM WITH THE

16:23.733 --> 16:29.933
LATEST HITS.

16:30.000 --> 16:30.700
>> John: OOOH, THE LATEST HITS,

16:30.766 --> 16:31.133
YOU SAY?

16:31.200 --> 16:32.300
TELLING YOUR WORKERS TO PLAY

16:32.366 --> 16:33.533
VIDEO GAMES INSTEAD OF

16:33.600 --> 16:34.033
UNIONIZING IS INCREDIBLY

16:34.100 --> 16:34.766
CONDESCENDING.

16:34.833 --> 16:35.700
AND DOUBLY SO WHEN YOU CONSIDER

16:35.766 --> 16:36.500
VIDEO GAME CHARACTERS ARE THE

16:36.566 --> 16:37.433
ULTIMATE EXAMPLE OF EXPLOITED

16:37.500 --> 16:38.700
LABOR.

16:38.766 --> 16:40.133
THINK ABOUT IT: THEY TAKE ORDERS

16:40.200 --> 16:42.266
ALL DAY, USUALLY GET PAID IN

16:42.333 --> 16:45.100
COINS, AND NOT ONCE IN 36 YEARS

16:45.166 --> 16:46.633
OF PLAYING MARIO HAVE I EVER

16:46.700 --> 16:47.833
SEEN HIM GET TO TAKE A

16:47.900 --> 16:50.133
BATHROOM BREAK.

16:50.200 --> 16:50.900
NOT ONCE!

16:50.966 --> 16:51.833
THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM HAS TO BE

16:51.900 --> 16:52.533
LITTERED WITH PISS BOTTLES AT

16:52.600 --> 16:54.766
THIS POINT.

16:54.833 --> 16:55.900
AND YOU MIGHT SAY, "WELL, OF

16:55.966 --> 16:57.400
COURSE A UNION COLLECTS DUES.

16:57.466 --> 16:59.100
HOW ELSE ARE THEY GOING TO HAVE

16:59.166 --> 17:00.900
THE RESOURCES TO FIGHT FOR THEIR

17:00.966 --> 17:02.533
MEMBERS?"

17:02.600 --> 17:03.700
BUT THESE CONSULTING FIRMS WILL

17:03.766 --> 17:06.800
INSIST THAT UNIONS SIMPLY TAKE

17:06.866 --> 17:08.100
MONEY AND OFFER NOTHING IN

17:08.166 --> 17:09.166
RETURN.

17:09.233 --> 17:11.766
HERE'S HOW THE LABOR RELATIONS

17:11.833 --> 17:14.333
INSTITUTE PUTS IT IN ONE OF ITS

17:14.400 --> 17:15.166
UNION-BUSTING VIDEOS.

17:15.233 --> 17:16.033
>> UNIONS ARE IN TROUBLE.

17:16.100 --> 17:16.866
THEIR MEMBERSHIP IS SHRINKING,

17:16.933 --> 17:18.166
WHICH MEANS THEY'RE IN DANGER OF

17:18.233 --> 17:19.500
GOING OUT OF BUSINESS.

17:19.566 --> 17:20.933
THEY SEND OUT HIGH-PRESSURE

17:21.000 --> 17:22.666
SALESPEOPLE TO SELL A BILL OF

17:22.733 --> 17:24.266
GOODS THAT MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE

17:24.333 --> 17:25.200
IS EITHER OF NO REAL VALUE OR IS

17:25.266 --> 17:27.400
HIGHLY OVERPRICED.

17:27.466 --> 17:30.300
>> John: SO JUST TO BE CLEAR,

17:30.366 --> 17:32.000
THAT'S A FOR-PROFIT CONSULTING

17:32.066 --> 17:33.833
FIRM, BEING PAID BY A FOR-PROFIT

17:33.900 --> 17:35.433
COMPANY, ARGUING UNIONS ARE ONLY

17:35.500 --> 17:38.433
IN IT FOR THE MONEY.

17:38.500 --> 17:39.700
THAT IS PRETTY FANTASTIC.

17:39.766 --> 17:40.633
IT'S NOT EVEN THE POT CALLING

17:40.700 --> 17:41.866
THE KETTLE BLACK, IT'S THE POT

17:41.933 --> 17:45.566
CALLING THE KETTLE "A POT."

17:45.633 --> 17:46.433
IT'S LIKE BEING CALLED A

17:46.500 --> 17:48.233
BAD FIRST DATE BY TED BUNDY.

17:48.300 --> 17:53.266
LRI CONSULTANTS HAVE ALSO TOLD

17:53.333 --> 17:54.200
EMPLOYEES THAT JOINING A UNION

17:54.266 --> 17:55.400
MIGHT GET THEM A CONTRACT WITH

17:55.466 --> 17:55.966
LESS WAGES AND LESS BENEFITS

17:56.033 --> 17:57.833
THAN THEY CURRENTLY HAVE.

17:57.900 --> 18:00.866
BUT THINK HOW RIDICULOUS THAT

18:00.933 --> 18:03.166
ARGUMENT IS.

18:03.233 --> 18:04.833
IF COMPANIES GENUINELY THOUGHT

18:04.900 --> 18:05.900
UNIONS WOULD NEGOTIATE WORSE

18:05.966 --> 18:06.633
TERMS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES,

18:06.700 --> 18:07.900
THEY'D BE WELCOMING THEM IN WITH

18:07.966 --> 18:09.133
OPEN ARMS.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.900
JEFF BEZOS WOULD'VE SHOWN UP TO

18:10.966 --> 18:11.633
THAT INTERVIEW IN A CHE GUEVARA

18:11.700 --> 18:12.800
T-SHIRT IF HE THOUGHT IT WOULD

18:12.866 --> 18:15.333
HELP HIM PAY PEOPLE LESS.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.533
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS UNIONIZED

18:17.600 --> 18:18.700
WORKERS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR

18:18.766 --> 18:20.233
HAVE WAGES ABOUT 25% HIGHER THAN

18:20.300 --> 18:21.500
THEIR NON-UNION COUNTERPARTS.

18:21.566 --> 18:24.300
THAT'S WHY COMPANIES WANT TO

18:24.366 --> 18:25.766
KEEP UNIONS OUT.

18:25.833 --> 18:27.600
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE WILLING TO

18:27.666 --> 18:28.666
PAY LRI $3,000 PER CONSULTANT

18:28.733 --> 18:29.800
PER DAY.

18:29.866 --> 18:31.166
BUT THE ANTI-UNION ARGUMENT

18:31.233 --> 18:32.600
ISN'T JUST THAT THEY ARE

18:32.666 --> 18:34.333
USELESS -- IT'S THAT THEY'LL

18:34.400 --> 18:35.900
DESTROY THE BEAUTIFUL

18:35.966 --> 18:37.100
WORKPLACE CULTURE THAT

18:37.166 --> 18:39.500
COMPANIES HAVE CREATED.

18:39.566 --> 18:40.766
HERE'S HOW TARGET FRAMED IT IN

18:40.833 --> 18:43.000
ONE OF THEIR UNION-BUSTING

18:43.066 --> 18:44.666
VIDEOS.

18:44.733 --> 18:46.966
>> IF THE UNIONS DID TRY TO

18:47.033 --> 18:48.766
ORGANIZE TARGET TEAM MEMBERS,

18:48.833 --> 18:50.633
THEY COULD ALSO TRY AND BRING

18:50.700 --> 18:51.600
ALONG THEIR WAY OF DOING

18:51.666 --> 18:52.266
BUSINESS, AN OLD-FASHIONED,

18:52.333 --> 18:53.100
RIGID STRUCTURE.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.066
NO ONE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT COULD

18:54.133 --> 18:56.166
HAPPEN, BUT THERE ARE LOTS

18:56.233 --> 18:57.266
OF EXAMPLES OF HOW RIGID

18:57.333 --> 18:58.433
GROCERY STORE UNION CONTRACTS

18:58.500 --> 19:00.066
COULD HURT OUR STORES' ABILITY

19:00.133 --> 19:02.766
TO SERVE GUESTS.

19:02.833 --> 19:04.400
>> HERE'S WHAT WE MEAN.

19:04.466 --> 19:06.233
♪ ♪

19:06.300 --> 19:07.933
LET'S SAY YOU'RE WORKING IN

19:08.000 --> 19:09.666
STATIONARY, BUT YOU'RE WALKING

19:09.733 --> 19:11.366
THROUGH DOMESTICS ON YOUR WAY TO

19:11.433 --> 19:13.833
CHECK ON SOMETHING.

19:13.900 --> 19:15.500
A GUEST STOPS YOU AND ASKS FOR

19:15.566 --> 19:17.633
HELP.

19:17.700 --> 19:20.633
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

19:20.700 --> 19:21.466
WITHOUT EVEN THINKING ABOUT IT,

19:21.533 --> 19:22.133
YOU'D STOP AND GIVE THEM ANY

19:22.200 --> 19:22.900
ASSISTANCE THEY REQUIRED.

19:22.966 --> 19:23.966
BUT WHAT IF UNION WORK RULES SAY

19:24.033 --> 19:25.800
YOU CAN'T WORK OUTSIDE OF YOUR

19:25.866 --> 19:26.633
DEPARTMENT?

19:26.700 --> 19:28.000
WHAT DO YOU TELL THE GUEST?

19:28.066 --> 19:28.533
"SORRY, I N'T HELP YOU"?

19:28.600 --> 19:31.233
THAT MAKES YOU LOOK BAD.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.833
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT MEANS

19:32.900 --> 19:35.033
OUR GUEST DOESN'T GET IMMEDIATE

19:35.100 --> 19:36.766
ATTENTION AND THEY MIGHT NOT

19:36.833 --> 19:38.466
COME BACK.

19:38.533 --> 19:39.266
SO EVERYONE GETS HURT.

19:39.333 --> 19:39.966
EVERYONE EXCEPT THE UNION.

19:40.033 --> 19:42.066
>> John: OOH, I LIKE HOW THEY

19:42.133 --> 19:43.633
PUT THAT LAST PART IN BLACK AND

19:43.700 --> 19:45.166
WHITE, SO WE KNOW IT'S BAD.

19:45.233 --> 19:45.833
WE'RE TALKING "CAN'T OPEN A JAR"

19:45.900 --> 19:47.266
BAD.

19:47.333 --> 19:49.400
THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY!

19:49.466 --> 19:51.833
BUT IF I CAN GIVE THE TARGET

19:51.900 --> 19:54.366
EXECUTIVES ONE NOTE:

19:54.433 --> 19:56.566
HAVE YOU EVER WORKED RETAIL?

19:56.633 --> 19:57.533
BECAUSE IF YOU HAD, YOU'D KNOW

19:57.600 --> 19:58.466
THAT TELLING YOUR FLOOR WORKERS

19:58.533 --> 20:00.466
THEY'D BE ABLE TO TELL A

20:00.533 --> 20:02.333
CUSTOMER "FUCK OFF, THIS ISN'T

20:02.400 --> 20:03.633
MY DEPARTMENT" IS A PRETTY GOOD

20:03.700 --> 20:04.333
ARGUMENT TO VOTE YES ON THAT

20:04.400 --> 20:05.300
UNION.

20:05.366 --> 20:06.800
HONESTLY, THAT MIGHT BE WORTH IT

20:06.866 --> 20:08.133
ON ITS OWN.

20:08.200 --> 20:09.866
AND FUN SIDE NOTE: THOSE

20:09.933 --> 20:11.500
AREN'T JUST ACTORS, THEY'RE

20:11.566 --> 20:13.766
UNION ACTORS -- MEMBERS OF

20:13.833 --> 20:18.633
THE SCREEN ACTORS GUILD.

20:18.700 --> 20:20.733
IN FACT, THAT MAN LATER ACTUALLY

20:20.800 --> 20:21.933
STRESSED IN AN INTERVIEW THAT HE

20:22.000 --> 20:22.633
IS VERY MUCH PRO-UNION,

20:22.700 --> 20:23.466
DEFENDING HIS APPEARANCE IN THE

20:23.533 --> 20:24.300
VIDEO BY SAYING, "IF SOMEONE

20:24.366 --> 20:25.233
HIRES ME TO PLAY A RAPIST,

20:25.300 --> 20:26.300
DOES IT MAKE ME A RAPIST?"

20:26.366 --> 20:27.700
TO WHICH I'D HAVE TO RESPOND

20:27.766 --> 20:30.333
"WHAT?"

20:30.400 --> 20:32.933
AND "I -- I GUESS NOT, BUT...

20:33.000 --> 20:36.200
WHAT?"

20:36.266 --> 20:37.400
BUT THE MOST FRIGHTENING AND

20:37.466 --> 20:38.400
EFFECTIVE ARGUMENT COMPANIES

20:38.466 --> 20:39.766
MAKE AGAINST UNIONS ISN'T JUST

20:39.833 --> 20:40.500
THAT THEY'LL KEEP YOU FROM

20:40.566 --> 20:41.366
HELPING CUSTOMERS IN OTHER

20:41.433 --> 20:43.200
DEPARTMENTS.

20:43.266 --> 20:44.333
IT'S THAT THEY'LL COST YOU YOUR

20:44.400 --> 20:45.600
JOB.

20:45.666 --> 20:46.900
NOW, THANKFULLY, IT'S AGAINST

20:46.966 --> 20:47.933
THE LAW FOR COMPANIES TO

20:48.000 --> 20:50.466
THREATEN WORKERS THAT IF THEY

20:50.533 --> 20:51.600
UNIONIZE, THEIR WORKPLACE WILL

20:51.666 --> 20:52.966
CLOSE.

20:53.033 --> 20:54.066
HOWEVER, HILARIOUSLY, IT IS

20:54.133 --> 20:55.466
LEGAL FOR THEM TO "PREDICT" THAT

20:55.533 --> 20:56.333
IT'LL SHUT DOWN.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.966
WHICH OBVIOUSLY ISN'T A REAL

20:59.033 --> 21:00.366
DISTINCTION.

21:00.433 --> 21:01.866
WHEN A LOAN SHARK THREATENS TO

21:01.933 --> 21:03.400
BREAK YOUR LEGS, THAT'S NOT

21:03.466 --> 21:05.433
MEANINGFULLY DIFFERENT FROM A

21:05.500 --> 21:06.400
LOAN SHARK "PREDICTING THAT LEGS

21:06.466 --> 21:07.433
WILL BE BROKEN AS A RESULT OF

21:07.500 --> 21:08.733
MARKET FORCES RELATING TO LACK

21:08.800 --> 21:10.200
OF PAYMENT."

21:10.266 --> 21:12.800
AND THAT PREDICTION LOOPHOLE CAN

21:12.866 --> 21:14.100
LET A LOT THROUGH -- FOR

21:14.166 --> 21:14.900
INSTANCE, COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR

21:14.966 --> 21:16.666
BROUGHT IN A CONSULTANT WHO

21:16.733 --> 21:17.433
FREESTYLED TO A CAPTIVE MEETING

21:17.500 --> 21:19.000
OF WORKERS ABOUT WHAT COULD

21:19.066 --> 21:20.733
HAPPEN IF THEY UNIONIZE.

21:20.800 --> 21:23.766
>> I'VE SEEN THE WORST OF IT,

21:23.833 --> 21:26.266
DOESN'T ALWAYS END UP GOING SO

21:26.333 --> 21:27.233
BADLY, BUT I MEAN, I'VE SEEN

21:27.300 --> 21:28.966
PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, JUST

21:29.033 --> 21:30.100
COMPLETELY BANKRUPTED.

21:30.166 --> 21:36.300
MARRIAGES LOST, HOMES LOST, YOU

21:36.366 --> 21:37.566
KNOW --

21:37.633 --> 21:39.900
>> COMPANY CLOSING.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.366
>> YEAH, SOMETIMES THAT HAPPENS

21:41.433 --> 21:41.933
TOO.

21:42.033 --> 21:42.866
I MEAN, LOOK AT -- LOOK AT

21:42.933 --> 21:43.600
DETROIT.

21:43.666 --> 21:44.766
I MEAN, ALL THE -- THE AUTO

21:44.833 --> 21:45.433
WORKERS THERE, I MEAN, TENS OF

21:45.500 --> 21:46.300
THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES LOST

21:46.366 --> 21:47.333
THEIR JOBS OVERNIGHT.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.800
>> John: WOW.

21:48.866 --> 21:49.433
THAT IS A LEVEL OF FEARMONGERING

21:49.500 --> 21:50.633
RARELY SEEN OUTSIDE AN

21:50.700 --> 21:52.633
ABSTINENCE-ONLY SEX ED CLASS.

21:52.700 --> 21:54.266
"DON'T JOIN A UNION -- UNLESS

21:54.333 --> 21:55.333
YOU WANT TO END UP PREGNANT,

21:55.400 --> 21:56.600
DIVORCED, HOMELESS, AND

21:56.666 --> 21:58.300
DETROIT."

21:58.366 --> 21:59.800
AND IT'S NOT JUST COLUMBIA

21:59.866 --> 22:02.633
SPORTSWEAR -- WHEN WORKERS AT A

22:02.700 --> 22:04.366
TIRE COMPANY CALLED KUMHO TRIED

22:04.433 --> 22:05.566
TO UNIONIZE A FEW YEARS BACK,

22:05.633 --> 22:06.800
12 DIFFERENT MANAGERS ISSUED

22:06.866 --> 22:08.166
THREATS TO CLOSE THE PLANT IF

22:08.233 --> 22:09.000
THE UNION WON.

22:09.066 --> 22:10.866
WHICH IS UNDENIABLY SCARY.

22:10.933 --> 22:11.766
AND IT WORKED -- BECAUSE EVEN

22:11.833 --> 22:15.100
THOUGH 80% OF KUMHO WORKERS HAD

22:15.166 --> 22:17.866
INITIALLY SIGNED CARDS

22:17.933 --> 22:19.833
SUPPORTING UNIONIZATION, WHEN

22:19.900 --> 22:22.133
THE VOTE HAPPENED, LESS THAN A

22:22.200 --> 22:23.300
MONTH LATER, ONLY 43% VOTED TO

22:23.366 --> 22:26.933
ORGANIZE.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.766
AND THAT'S THE THING.

22:28.833 --> 22:30.133
THREATS THAT A WORKPLACE WILL

22:30.200 --> 22:31.200
CLOSE ARE EFFECTIVE, DESPITE

22:31.266 --> 22:32.900
BEING OVERWHELMINGLY BULLSHIT.

22:32.966 --> 22:34.166
ONE STUDY FOUND 51% OF COMPANIES

22:34.233 --> 22:35.600
THREATENED TO CLOSE PLANTS IF

22:35.666 --> 22:37.500
UNIONS WON, WHILE JUST 1%

22:37.566 --> 22:41.466
ACTUALLY CLOSED OPERATIONS AFTER

22:41.533 --> 22:42.900
A UNION VICTORY.

22:42.966 --> 22:44.033
IT'S THE SAME STORY AGAIN AND

22:44.100 --> 22:46.566
AGAIN, AND IT CAN BE DISPIRITING

22:46.633 --> 22:48.100
FOR THOSE WHO KNOW HOW MUCH GOOD

22:48.166 --> 22:49.033
A UNION COULD DO FOR THEIR

22:49.100 --> 22:51.133
COWORKERS.

22:51.200 --> 22:54.100
LISTEN TO A WOMAN WHO TRIED TO

22:54.166 --> 22:55.900
ORGANIZE HER NISSAN PLANT, TALK

22:55.966 --> 22:56.900
ABOUT HOW IT FELT, WATCHING HER

22:56.966 --> 22:58.900
UNION DRIVE FALL APART:

22:58.966 --> 23:00.400
>> WHEN WE STARTED THIS, I MEAN,

23:00.466 --> 23:01.866
MY WHOLE LINE WAS JUST -- THEY

23:01.933 --> 23:03.600
WERE JUST, "YES."

23:03.666 --> 23:06.533
BUT WHEN NISSAN STARTED BRINGING

23:06.600 --> 23:07.733
IN THOSE ANTI-UNION VIDEOS, I

23:07.800 --> 23:11.800
SEEN MY COWORKERS, JUST, THE

23:11.866 --> 23:14.733
LOOK ON THEIR FACE, IT WAS,

23:14.800 --> 23:18.866
"BETTY, I JUST CAN'T DO IT."

23:18.933 --> 23:20.266
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S

23:20.333 --> 23:23.400
HEARTBREAKING.

23:23.466 --> 23:26.266
AND FRUSTRATINGLY, EVEN ON THE

23:26.333 --> 23:27.500
RARE OCCASION WORKERS MANAGE TO

23:27.566 --> 23:28.600
OVERCOME EVERYTHING YOU'VE SEEN

23:28.666 --> 23:29.333
TONIGHT AND WIN THEIR ELECTION,

23:29.400 --> 23:30.266
THE FIGHT STILL MIGHT NOT BE

23:30.333 --> 23:30.933
OVER.

23:31.000 --> 23:31.733
AS A STUDY FOUND, IN A QUARTER

23:31.800 --> 23:32.433
OF ALL SUCCESSFUL UNION

23:32.500 --> 23:33.166
ELECTIONS, GETTING A CONTRACT

23:33.233 --> 23:34.133
CAN TAKE THREE YEARS OR LONGER.

23:34.200 --> 23:35.333
AND WHILE COMPANIES ARE SUPPOSED

23:35.400 --> 23:36.366
TO BARGAIN IN GOOD FAITH, THEY

23:36.433 --> 23:37.366
CAN LEGALLY DRAW THINGS OUT TO A

23:37.433 --> 23:38.700
RIDICULOUS DEGREE.

23:38.766 --> 23:39.800
IN 2009, SOME TEXAS EMPLOYEES AT

23:39.866 --> 23:42.533
DISH NETWORK VOTED TO UNIONIZE,

23:42.600 --> 23:44.466
BUT OVER A DECADE LATER, THEY

23:44.533 --> 23:46.466
STILL HAVE NO CONTRACT.

23:46.533 --> 23:47.833
AND THINK ABOUT HOW LONG AGO

23:47.900 --> 23:50.400
2009 WAS.

23:50.466 --> 23:52.066
BACK THEN, THE KIDS ON

23:52.133 --> 23:53.766
"MODERN FAMILY" LOOKED LIKE

23:53.833 --> 23:54.833
ACTUAL CHILDREN, AND AT THAT

23:54.900 --> 23:56.033
POINT, NONE OF THEM WERE ENGAGED

23:56.100 --> 23:57.266
TO THE BARTENDER FROM THE

23:57.333 --> 23:59.166
"BACHELOR" FRANCHISE.

23:59.233 --> 23:59.933
IN 2009, THE QUESTION ON

24:00.000 --> 24:00.800
EVERYONE'S LIPS WAS "IS THE GUY

24:00.866 --> 24:01.666
FROM 'DEGRASSI' REALLY RAPPING

24:01.733 --> 24:03.766
NOW?

24:03.833 --> 24:06.766
IS HE REALLY DOING THAT?"

24:06.833 --> 24:07.866
AND YOU REALLY WANT ME TO

24:07.933 --> 24:09.200
TRANSPORT YOU BACK TO THAT TIME?

24:09.266 --> 24:10.200
TWO WORDS.

24:10.266 --> 24:11.833
SUSAN BOYLE.

24:11.900 --> 24:13.233
REMEMBER HOW HER WHOLE THING

24:13.300 --> 24:14.000
WAS, "WE DIDN'T EXPECT SOMEONE

24:14.066 --> 24:14.866
WHO LOOKED NORMAL COULD SING

24:14.933 --> 24:16.666
GOOD"?

24:16.733 --> 24:18.000
THE POINT IS, 2009 WAS A LONG

24:18.066 --> 24:19.233
TIME AGO, AND THAT'S HOW

24:19.300 --> 24:21.166
RIDICULOUSLY LONG THE EMPLOYEES

24:21.233 --> 24:22.466
OF DISH NETWORK HAVE BEEN

24:22.533 --> 24:24.866
WAITING FOR A FAIR UNION

24:24.933 --> 24:25.866
CONTRACT.

24:25.933 --> 24:26.800
AND THAT ACTUALLY BRINGS US TO

24:26.866 --> 24:28.633
THE FINAL PROBLEM HERE.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.000
BECAUSE FAR TOO OFTEN, THE

24:30.066 --> 24:32.533
CONSEQUENCES FOR ANTI-UNION

24:32.600 --> 24:33.166
ACTIONS BY COMPANIES ARE MINIMAL

24:33.233 --> 24:34.166
TO NONE.

24:34.233 --> 24:35.600
FOR INSTANCE, COMPANIES AREN'T

24:35.666 --> 24:37.033
SUPPOSED TO RETALIATE AGAINST

24:37.100 --> 24:38.266
WORKERS WHO UNIONIZE, BUT IT

24:38.333 --> 24:40.133
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

24:40.200 --> 24:41.166
TAKE CYNTHIA HARPER, WHO WORKED

24:41.233 --> 24:42.966
AT A FACTORY THAT MADE

24:43.033 --> 24:44.033
WINDSHIELDS.

24:44.100 --> 24:46.066
AFTER SHE SPOKE UP IN FAVOR OF A

24:46.133 --> 24:47.633
UNION, SHE HAD A PRETTY SUDDEN,

24:47.700 --> 24:48.600
AND PRETTY SUSPICIOUS, CHANGE TO

24:48.666 --> 24:49.966
HER JOB.

24:50.033 --> 24:51.000
>> EVER SINCE THEY STARTED THIS

24:51.066 --> 24:54.600
JOB, IT'S BEEN A TWO-MAN JOB.

24:54.666 --> 24:57.500
WHEN THEY PUT ME OUT HERE ON IT,

24:57.566 --> 24:58.500
THEY DECIDED THEY WANTED IT TO

24:58.566 --> 25:03.266
BE A ONE-PERSON'S JOB.

25:03.333 --> 25:04.100
WHEN I WOULD TALK TO HR,

25:04.166 --> 25:04.933
I TOLD THEM THEY WERE

25:05.000 --> 25:06.066
TARGETING ME.

25:06.133 --> 25:07.666
PUTTING ME ON A JOB TO SET ME UP

25:07.733 --> 25:09.666
TO WRITE ME UP FOR PERFORMANCE

25:09.733 --> 25:21.233
ISSUES AND FIRE ME.

25:21.300 --> 25:22.433
>> John: OKAY, THAT'S PRETTY

25:22.500 --> 25:24.000
BRAZEN.

25:24.066 --> 25:25.033
THEY TOOK A JOB CLEARLY FOR TWO

25:25.100 --> 25:26.100
PEOPLE AND MADE HER DO IT ON HER

25:26.166 --> 25:27.400
OWN.

25:27.466 --> 25:29.100
AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO SET HER

25:29.166 --> 25:30.900
UP FOR FAILURE, WHY STOP THERE?

25:30.966 --> 25:32.400
WHY NOT GIVE HER EVERYONE'S JOB?

25:32.466 --> 25:33.566
WHY NOT SEND THE ENTIRE FACTORY

25:33.633 --> 25:34.633
HOME WITH A NOTE SAYING "RELAX,

25:34.700 --> 25:36.233
EVERYONE -- CYNTHIA'S GOT THIS."

25:36.300 --> 25:38.900
AND THE THING IS, SHE WAS RIGHT.

25:38.966 --> 25:40.066
SOON AFTER THAT, SHE WAS

25:40.133 --> 25:41.566
FIRED, ALONG WITH TWO OTHER

25:41.633 --> 25:43.900
PRO-UNION COWORKERS.

25:43.966 --> 25:51.700
BUT THE CONSEQUENCES FOR A

25:51.766 --> 25:52.466
COMPANY DOING THAT ARE JUST

25:52.533 --> 25:53.166
PATHETIC.

25:53.233 --> 25:53.766
A COMPANY THAT WRONGLY

25:53.833 --> 25:55.300
TERMINATES A WORKER FOR

25:55.366 --> 25:56.000
SUPPORTING A UNION MIGHT BE

25:56.066 --> 25:56.700
FORCED TO PROVIDE BACK PAY --

25:56.766 --> 25:57.566
BUT THAT'S A PRETTY SMALL PRICE

25:57.633 --> 25:58.533
TO PAY IF IT HELPS THEM CRUSH A

25:58.600 --> 26:02.900
UNION.

26:02.966 --> 26:03.566
OTHER PUNISHMENTS ARE EVEN

26:03.633 --> 26:04.333
WEAKER, LIKE THE FACT THAT --

26:04.400 --> 26:04.933
AND THIS IS TRUE -- A COMPANY

26:05.000 --> 26:05.566
CAN BE ORDERED TO POST A NOTICE

26:05.633 --> 26:06.266
ON THE BULLETIN BOARD, IN WHICH

26:06.333 --> 26:07.066
IT ADMITS IT VIOLATED THE LAW,

26:07.133 --> 26:08.033
BUT ALSO, AND THIS IS CRUCIAL,

26:08.100 --> 26:10.800
PROMISES NOT TO DO IT AGAIN.

26:10.866 --> 26:12.466
AND COME ON.

26:12.533 --> 26:13.666
A COMPANY SHOULD PROBABLY FACE

26:13.733 --> 26:15.300
MORE CONSEQUENCES FOR ILLEGALLY

26:15.366 --> 26:16.566
UNION-BUSTING THAN THIS DOG, WHO

26:16.633 --> 26:18.900
CLEARLY LIKES TO HUMP THIS CAT.

26:18.966 --> 26:20.500
AND HONESTLY, IN BOTH CASES I

26:20.566 --> 26:21.600
DOUBT THE SIGN IS GOING TO

26:21.666 --> 26:27.266
CHANGE THE UNDERLYING BEHAVIOR.

26:27.333 --> 26:27.900
SO IT'S NO WONDER THAT U.S.

26:27.966 --> 26:29.633
EMPLOYERS ARE CHARGED WITH

26:29.700 --> 26:30.233
VIOLATING FEDERAL LAW IN OVER

26:30.300 --> 26:31.166
40% OF ALL UNION ELECTION

26:31.233 --> 26:32.233
CAMPAIGNS, BECAUSE WHY WOULDN'T

26:32.300 --> 26:33.133
THEY?

26:33.200 --> 26:34.333
EVEN WHEN THOSE CHARGES ARE

26:34.400 --> 26:35.366
PROVEN, THE CONSEQUENCES ARE

26:35.433 --> 26:37.533
LAUGHABLE.

26:37.600 --> 26:38.666
ONE ANTI-UNION CONSULTANT HAS

26:38.733 --> 26:40.400
FLAT-OUT STATED, "WHAT HAPPENS

26:40.466 --> 26:42.466
IF YOU VIOLATE THE LAW?

26:42.533 --> 26:43.100
THE PROBABILITY IS YOU WILL

26:43.166 --> 26:44.400
NEVER GET CAUGHT.

26:44.466 --> 26:45.700
IF YOU DO GET CAUGHT, THE WORST

26:45.766 --> 26:47.233
THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU IS

26:47.300 --> 26:49.166
YOU GET A SECOND ELECTION AND

26:49.233 --> 26:51.466
THE EMPLOYER WINS 96% OF SECOND

26:51.533 --> 26:52.566
ELECTIONS."

26:52.633 --> 26:53.800
AND IT'S NOT GREAT THAT

26:53.866 --> 26:55.400
UNION-BUSTING FIRMS ARE TELLING

26:55.466 --> 26:57.600
COMPANIES THAT.

26:57.666 --> 27:00.366
BUT IT'S EVEN WORSE THAT IT'S

27:00.433 --> 27:01.200
FUCKING TRUE.

27:01.266 --> 27:02.033
SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

27:02.100 --> 27:03.000
WELL, CONGRESS COULD STEP IN TO

27:03.066 --> 27:03.766
HELP REBALANCE THE PLAYING

27:03.833 --> 27:04.733
