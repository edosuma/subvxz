THAT'S TODAY.

17:58.903 --> 18:02.081
-EXCUSE ME, THE YACHT,
A STAR OF HONG KONG.

18:02.211 --> 18:03.430
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?

18:03.560 --> 18:05.171
IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE IN AT, LIKE, 3:30.

18:05.301 --> 18:07.869
-YEAH, NO, SHE RAN
INTO SOME BAD WEATHER.

18:07.999 --> 18:09.566
AFRAID SHE'S GONNA BE DELAYED.

18:09.697 --> 18:11.438
-DELAYED? HOW LONG?

19:10.192 --> 19:11.498
-LET ME GO!

19:14.675 --> 19:16.590
YOU LOOKED SO ANGRY.
IT SCARED ME.

19:17.939 --> 19:20.594
LOOK, COME ON, I KNOW--
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE MONEY.

19:20.724 --> 19:22.683
MY AUDITION TOOK
LONGER THAN EXPECTED.

19:22.813 --> 19:25.294
AND WHEN I GOT TO THE
RESTAURANT MY BOSS FIRED ME.

19:28.036 --> 19:30.343
I WAS TOO EMBARRASSED
TO SHOW UP EMPTY-HANDED.

19:31.953 --> 19:34.303
YOU PROBABLY THINK I RAN
OUT ON YOU, DON'T YOU.

19:34.434 --> 19:36.523
-YEAH, WELL, THE
THOUGHT CROSSED MY MIND.

19:37.654 --> 19:39.265
BUT THAT'S NOT WHY
I CHASED AFTER YOU.

19:40.004 --> 19:40.962
-IT'S NOT?

19:41.092 --> 19:42.616
-YOUR FATHER'S LOOKING FOR YOU.

19:43.791 --> 19:44.792
-MY FATHER.

19:47.925 --> 19:49.971
YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM
YOU SAW ME, DID YOU?

19:51.407 --> 19:52.321
-YES.

19:54.889 --> 19:56.456
HE NEEDS TO TALK TO YOU.

19:59.154 --> 20:00.634
YOUR FATHER IS DYING, RACHEL.

20:01.983 --> 20:03.114
OR IS IT NANCY?

20:03.941 --> 20:05.726
-MY FATHER'S NOT DYING.

20:05.856 --> 20:07.684
IT'S A TRICK SO YOU'LL
FEEL SORRY FOR HIM

20:07.815 --> 20:08.903
AND HELP HIM FIND ME.

20:09.469 --> 20:11.427
-YOU EXPECT ME TO
BELIEVE THAT, RIGHT?

20:11.558 --> 20:12.776
-RIGHT.

20:12.907 --> 20:14.648
-GIVE ME A BREAK.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.389
-IT'S TRUE.

20:17.694 --> 20:20.697
LOOK, MY NAME IS NANCY, OKAY.

20:22.133 --> 20:24.092
I LIED 'CAUSE MY
FATHER'S A MANIAC

20:24.223 --> 20:26.790
AND IF HE FINDS ME
HE'LL BEAT ME AGAIN.

20:26.921 --> 20:29.663
-COME ON, I MET YOUR FATHER.

20:30.272 --> 20:32.579
HE LOOKS LIKE THE MOST
GENTLE MAN I'VE EVER SEEN.

20:32.709 --> 20:35.364
-YOU CAN'T JUDGE
SOMEONE BY HOW THEY LOOK.

20:35.495 --> 20:36.583
HE'S AN ANIMAL.

20:37.279 --> 20:39.194
PLEASE, MATT, DON'T
LET HIM FIND ME.

20:42.328 --> 20:43.938
PLEASE DON'T TELL HIM ABOUT ME.

20:44.460 --> 20:45.505
-TELL HIM WHAT?

20:46.593 --> 20:48.203
THE FAKE ADDRESS YOU GAVE ME?

20:48.334 --> 20:50.292
-YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
HE HITS ME.

20:50.423 --> 20:51.989
THAT'S WHY I RAN AWAY.

20:53.164 --> 20:56.646
-HEY, I CAN'T FORCE YOU
TO DEAL WITH YOUR FATHER.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.909
BUT IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND,

20:59.040 --> 21:00.520
YOU CAN REACH HIM THROUGH
THE BAYWATCH HEADQUARTERS.

YOU THOUGHT ABOUT SCOTT.

-I THINK HE'S A GREAT GUY.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.745
-HE IS, HE'S REALLY TERRIFIC.

-SO THEN WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

24:05.139 --> 24:10.231
-WELL, THE PROBLEM IS
THAT HE'S IN THE MILITARY.

MOTHER WENT THROUGH,

24:13.016 --> 24:14.844
I MEAN, SHE NEVER
REALLY RECOVERED WHEN

24:14.975 --> 24:16.280
MY FATHER DIED IN THE WAR.

24:16.933 --> 24:18.195
I SWORE THAT I WOULD
NEVER GET INVOLVED

24:18.326 --> 24:19.719
WITH A MAN IN THE MILITARY.

24:19.849 --> 24:22.591
-STEPHANIE, WE'RE NOT AT WAR.

IT'S NOT A STABLE LIFE.

MY KIDS IN THAT KIND
OF ENVIRONMENT.

ALREADY TALKING MARRIAGE?

HOLDING BACK WITH HIM.

24:43.525 --> 24:44.395
-WHY?

24:48.399 --> 24:51.272
-MAYBE BECAUSE DEEP DOWN INSIDE

24:51.402 --> 24:52.621
THERE'S THIS THOUGHT THAT MAYBE

24:53.796 --> 24:55.624
YOU AND I MIGHT GET
BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.

-STEPHANIE.

26:39.902 --> 26:40.860
-IT'S MY FATHER.

26:41.774 --> 26:43.732

26:43.863 --> 26:45.516
BUT IF I TOLD YOU HALF
THE THINGS HE'S DONE

26:45.647 --> 26:46.953
YOU'D WANT TO RIP HIS HEART OUT.

26:47.649 --> 26:48.955
-WELL, IF HE'S THAT BAD,

26:49.085 --> 26:50.043
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GO TO THE POLICE?

-'CAUSE IT WOULDN'T
DO ANY GOOD.

HE'D JUST DENY
EVERYTHING THAT I SAID.

27:06.015 --> 27:07.974
-WHAT'S AT THE YACHT CLUB?

27:08.104 --> 27:10.237
-I HAVE A PACKAGE THAT'S
ARRIVING ON A YACHT
THAT DOCKS THERE.

27:10.367 --> 27:12.065
