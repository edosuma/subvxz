Previously onB Positive...

00:03.786 --> 00:05.309
You're ready for
your transplant.

00:05.353 --> 00:06.919
Really?As soon as they
get an opening

00:06.963 --> 00:08.573
in the schedule,
you'll be getting her kidney.

00:08.617 --> 00:12.838
All right, I need you
to count backwards from ten.

00:12.882 --> 00:15.232
Ten.

00:15.276 --> 00:16.929
Nine.

00:16.973 --> 00:18.583
Eight.

00:18.627 --> 00:20.063

[monitor beeping steadily]

00:29.116 --> 00:31.727
Hit that with a sponge for me?

00:32.641 --> 00:34.164
Thank you.

00:34.208 --> 00:35.905
[gasps softly]

00:35.948 --> 00:37.602
Want to give me
a little room here?

00:37.646 --> 00:40.388
Sorry.
That's just a lot of blood.Step away.

00:44.087 --> 00:46.350
All right.

00:46.394 --> 00:49.049
We've revealed
the external iliac vein.

00:49.092 --> 00:51.181
Can we bring in the kidney,
please?

00:51.225 --> 00:55.446
Kidney here!
Fresh, ice-cold kidney!

00:55.490 --> 00:56.795
Gina?

00:56.839 --> 00:58.797
Drew! It is so good to see you.

00:58.841 --> 01:00.277
How are you doing?

01:00.321 --> 01:02.192
Honestly, a little nervous.

01:02.236 --> 01:03.759
Understandable.

01:03.802 --> 01:05.978
Whoa, that is
a lot of blood.

01:06.022 --> 01:07.719
Still waiting
on that kidney.

01:07.763 --> 01:08.981
Oh, sorry.

01:09.025 --> 01:10.113
Ah.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.115
Smells like chicken.

Time's a-wastin'.

01:14.857 --> 01:16.641
What are you doing?

01:16.685 --> 01:18.078
Whoa. That's my kidney!

01:25.172 --> 01:26.564
Please stop.Oh, come on,

01:26.608 --> 01:28.131

Hey.

02:17.659 --> 02:18.790
Hey.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.270
Doctor said
it went really well.

02:20.314 --> 02:22.707
Oh. Great.

02:22.751 --> 02:24.144
How's Gina?

02:24.187 --> 02:26.320
She's fine.
Room right next door.

02:26.363 --> 02:27.669
Thank God.

02:27.712 --> 02:29.018
I'm so happy you're okay.

02:29.061 --> 02:30.280
Ah, me, too, baby.

02:30.324 --> 02:31.760
Me, too.

02:32.935 --> 02:34.632
I want to see Gina.

02:34.676 --> 02:36.982
I'll go get a nurse.

02:37.026 --> 02:38.810
Want some water?

02:38.854 --> 02:40.290
Yeah. Thanks.

02:40.334 --> 02:43.467
Gina's really great,
isn't she?

02:43.511 --> 02:44.512
Ah, the best.

02:44.555 --> 02:47.906
So, what happens now?

02:47.950 --> 02:50.474
Is she, like,
gone from your life?

02:50.518 --> 02:54.043
No, no, never. Gina
means everything to me.

02:55.044 --> 02:57.220
Everything?

02:57.264 --> 02:58.830
You mean
you and her...?

02:58.874 --> 03:01.355
No. I mean...

03:01.398 --> 03:03.835
I don't know what I mean.

03:03.879 --> 03:07.012
I wonder if I should
call her Gina or Mom.

03:07.056 --> 03:08.057
Stop that.

03:08.100 --> 03:11.060
Maybe Kidney Donor
Hump Buddy.

03:11.103 --> 03:13.367
Aunt Gina.
Just call her Aunt Gina.

03:20.417 --> 03:23.333
Can you grab me a water?

03:23.377 --> 03:25.335
You're right there.

03:25.379 --> 03:29.078
Yeah, but I gave you a
kidney, so you kind of owe me.

03:29.121 --> 03:32.255
How long are you gonna hold this
over my head?

03:32.299 --> 03:34.562
As long as it's funny.

03:36.477 --> 03:39.262
[sighs]
You know, I think doctors
purposely make you wait

03:39.306 --> 03:41.351
when they have
important test results.

03:41.395 --> 03:43.875
Yeah. Girls
do that, too.

03:43.919 --> 03:45.877
I had a boyfriend
who thought I was pregnant,

03:45.921 --> 03:49.881
and I made him wait a long time
before I told him I wasn't.

03:49.925 --> 03:51.274
Why'd you do that?

03:51.318 --> 03:54.234
I had to make sure
he wouldn't flunk me.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.759
Open my water.

03:59.413 --> 04:01.632
[sighs]Hey there.

04:01.676 --> 04:03.765
Sorry for the wait.Are you?

04:06.289 --> 04:08.378
Great news.
Your creatinine levels

04:08.422 --> 04:10.467
are exactly
where they need to be.

04:11.207 --> 04:14.297
So my body's not
gonna reject the kidney?

04:14.341 --> 04:16.256
If it was going to, it
would have happened by now.

04:16.299 --> 04:17.431
Drew! We did it!

04:17.474 --> 04:18.823
We sure did!

04:18.867 --> 04:20.912
I had something to do with it.
But okay.

04:20.956 --> 04:22.784
Ah, I can't believe this.

04:22.827 --> 04:24.133
No more dialysis.

04:24.176 --> 04:26.091
No more worrying
about dying.

04:26.135 --> 04:28.572
Other than the normal worrying
about dying.

04:28.616 --> 04:30.095
Speaking of which,
you must remember

04:30.139 --> 04:31.923
to take your immunosuppressants
twice a day.

04:31.967 --> 04:33.621
You got it.For the rest of your life.

04:33.664 --> 04:35.753
Oh, don't worry, I'll stay
on top of the pills.

04:35.797 --> 04:38.626
I kind of own
his ass now.

04:39.322 --> 04:41.106
All right, well, I'll
see you in six months.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.412
Say thank you.

04:42.456 --> 04:43.457
I was gonna say it.

04:45.197 --> 04:47.025
Thanks, Doc.

04:47.069 --> 04:48.288
Wow.

04:48.331 --> 04:49.767
This is just...

04:49.811 --> 04:51.116
great news.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.292
Amazing.

04:52.335 --> 04:53.771
[both laugh]

04:53.815 --> 04:55.207
[sighs]

04:56.470 --> 04:59.473
Okay, well, I...
I got to get back to work.

04:59.516 --> 05:01.126
H-Hang on, Gina.

05:01.170 --> 05:02.998
I just got to say
something.

05:04.173 --> 05:07.437
What you've done for me...

05:07.481 --> 05:10.353
I-I don't think
I'll ever be able to repay you.

05:10.397 --> 05:11.963
You don't owe me anything,

05:12.007 --> 05:14.052
other than to live a long life.

05:14.096 --> 05:15.445
A good life.

05:15.489 --> 05:17.012
You got it.

05:18.013 --> 05:19.449
[both laugh]

05:19.493 --> 05:21.799
Oh, a part of me is inside you.

05:21.843 --> 05:24.149
It's kind of weird.

05:24.193 --> 05:25.455
No, it's not weird.

05:25.499 --> 05:27.022
It's beautiful.

05:27.065 --> 05:29.720
Okay, thatwas weird.

05:32.027 --> 05:35.335
You didn't even drink
your water.

05:35.378 --> 05:39.034
All right,
you are all set.

05:39.077 --> 05:40.340
Um...

05:40.383 --> 05:42.820
I kind of have to pee.

05:42.864 --> 05:45.345
You're kidding, right?

05:45.388 --> 05:47.347
Don't worry, I-I can hold it in.

05:47.390 --> 05:49.044
Yeah. You can.

05:51.568 --> 05:54.571
I got an empty Gatorade bottle
in my bag for emergencies.

05:54.615 --> 05:55.877
It's yours.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.269
Thank you.

05:57.313 --> 06:00.229
Uh, not to brag,
but is it a wide mouth?

06:03.058 --> 06:04.886
[snaps fingers]

06:04.929 --> 06:06.540
Quick question, you guys.

06:07.541 --> 06:11.501
Who has two thumbs and a fully
functioning, brand-new kidney?

06:11.545 --> 06:12.850
This guy.

06:12.894 --> 06:14.678
ELI/JERRY:
Congratulations.

06:14.722 --> 06:17.028
So your blood tests
came back clean?
Yep.

06:17.072 --> 06:19.248
I am good to go.

06:19.291 --> 06:21.511
That's great.
I'm happy for you, man.

06:21.555 --> 06:23.687
So happy for you.
No jealousy at all.

06:23.731 --> 06:26.211
I'm totally fine
strapped to this machine

06:26.255 --> 06:28.692
cleaning my blood
three days a week.

06:28.736 --> 06:31.869
So again...
just happy for you.

06:31.913 --> 06:33.044
DREW:
Thanks.

06:33.088 --> 06:35.046
So...

06:35.090 --> 06:38.267
how about I take you guys
out to a celebratory lunch?

06:38.310 --> 06:40.922
Uh, sorry,
we just strapped in.

06:40.965 --> 06:42.053
Another time?

06:42.097 --> 06:44.273
Right. Sure.

06:44.316 --> 06:46.449
Should have called ahead.

06:49.278 --> 06:50.410
Oh. Hi.

06:50.453 --> 06:51.541
Hi.

06:51.585 --> 06:53.151
I used to sit there.

06:54.588 --> 06:56.285
Okay.

06:59.114 --> 07:00.550
Hi.Hi.

07:00.594 --> 07:02.073
I got me a new kidney.

07:02.117 --> 07:03.466
I heard.

07:04.293 --> 07:07.165
[smacks lips]
So, are you two a couple, or...?

07:10.038 --> 07:13.998
Okay. Well, I guess
I'll see you guys around.

07:14.042 --> 07:15.957
Around where?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.002
[laughs]
Yes, Jerry.

07:18.046 --> 07:19.743
Good one.

07:19.787 --> 07:21.963
Okay, Dunbar out.

07:27.142 --> 07:29.144
Well, that was uncomfortable.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.626
Which one did you give him,
the left or the right?

07:32.669 --> 07:34.279
Right.

07:34.323 --> 07:36.760
So now your left kidney's doing
all the work?

07:36.804 --> 07:37.674
I guess.

07:37.718 --> 07:40.590
That doesn't seem fair.

07:40.634 --> 07:42.462
Do you even know
what kidneys do?

07:42.505 --> 07:43.941
They clean the blood of toxins

07:43.985 --> 07:45.987
and transform the waste
into urine.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.597
Good for you.

07:47.641 --> 07:50.165
I googled it
so I could brag about you.

07:51.166 --> 07:52.602
You know what's weird?

07:52.646 --> 07:55.692
Ever since the operation,
I've been feeling,

07:55.736 --> 07:57.694
I don't know...

07:57.738 --> 07:59.783
stupidly happy.

07:59.827 --> 08:02.525
They give you drugs?Not the stupid happy kind.

08:02.569 --> 08:04.614
So you went through this
for nothing?

08:04.658 --> 08:06.486
LUDLUM:
When you're done in here,

08:06.529 --> 08:09.489
strip the bed in 206
and toss the mattress.

08:09.532 --> 08:11.969
No. Mr. Knudsen?Yeah, heart attack

08:12.013 --> 08:12.970
on the toilet.

08:13.014 --> 08:15.016
That's so sad.

08:15.059 --> 08:17.497
He was always constipated.
It was bound to happen.

08:18.454 --> 08:20.804
Chop-chop.
Let's move it.

08:20.848 --> 08:23.154
I really liked him.

08:23.198 --> 08:25.635
He was such a sweet old man.

08:25.679 --> 08:28.986
Yeah, I think...
I think he had a crush on you.

08:29.030 --> 08:30.988
Oh, it was harmless.
His own daughter

08:31.032 --> 08:32.990
wanted nothing
to do with him,

08:33.034 --> 08:35.340
so he kind of adopted me.

08:35.384 --> 08:36.516
LUDLUM:
Forgot.

08:36.559 --> 08:37.995
Gina, Knudsen apparently

08:38.039 --> 08:40.041
left something in his will
for you.

08:40.084 --> 08:41.346
You're kidding.No.

08:41.390 --> 08:42.870
Expect a call from a lawyer.

08:42.913 --> 08:45.350
What about me?
Did he leave anything for me?

08:45.394 --> 08:49.224
Yeah. A truly horrifying mess
in his bathroom.

08:52.488 --> 08:54.664
I wonder what
he left me.

08:54.708 --> 08:57.014
I'll give you 20 bucks
to swab out the toilet.

08:57.058 --> 08:58.407
Not a chance.25.

08:58.450 --> 08:59.930
Let me see your money.

09:02.063 --> 09:03.543
[door closes]GINA:
Hello!

09:03.586 --> 09:05.283
Kitchen!

09:08.243 --> 09:10.854
Oh, this is nice.Yes.

09:10.898 --> 09:12.682
I thought I'd make dinner
a little special.

09:12.726 --> 09:14.205
Ooh.Wine?

09:14.249 --> 09:15.250
Please.

09:15.293 --> 09:17.382
On sale at Trader Joe's.

09:17.426 --> 09:19.384
12 bucks.Have to buy it.

09:19.428 --> 09:21.212
Have to.

09:21.256 --> 09:22.257
A toast.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.563
Oh, okay.
[laughs]

09:23.606 --> 09:25.608
To life,Mm.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.610
to love, to happiness.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.569
Okay, sure.

09:29.612 --> 09:31.222
Mm.

09:31.266 --> 09:33.573
Drew, I have to tell you
something.
Actually,

09:33.616 --> 09:34.878
I need to tell you
something first.

09:34.922 --> 09:36.401
Okay, but mine is more...Please can I say

09:36.445 --> 09:37.881
what I have to say
before I lose my nerve?

09:37.925 --> 09:40.101
Okay.

09:41.102 --> 09:43.234
Gina, uh...

09:43.278 --> 09:45.410
we've been friends
for a year now, and while I

09:45.454 --> 09:47.064
cherish that
relationship,

09:47.108 --> 09:49.719
I was thinking maybe we...

09:49.763 --> 09:51.416
I'm rich!

09:51.460 --> 09:52.504
What?

09:52.548 --> 09:54.594
Mr. Knudsen died taking a poop

09:54.637 --> 09:58.423
and left me $48 million!

09:58.467 --> 10:00.425
What?

10:00.469 --> 10:01.731
He was a wonderful old man.

10:01.775 --> 10:03.298
He was kind, funny--

10:03.341 --> 10:05.256
struggled with his bowels--

10:05.300 --> 10:07.302
but he always treated me
like I was a real person,

10:07.345 --> 10:09.913
not some loser working
a crappy minimum wage job

10:09.957 --> 10:13.656
at an old age home,
and now he is gone, and-and...

10:13.700 --> 10:16.616
I'm insanely rich!

10:18.661 --> 10:20.794
GINA:
So this is all mine?

10:20.837 --> 10:22.926
Not all of it.
There's taxes.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.928
How much?About half.

10:24.972 --> 10:29.803
So $24 million?Give or take.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.937
[breath shudders]

10:33.981 --> 10:35.504
Uh, are you okay?

10:36.723 --> 10:38.899
I just had a little orgasm.

10:41.031 --> 10:42.467
This is unbelievable.

10:42.511 --> 10:45.340
[gasps]
Crazy, right?

10:46.820 --> 10:49.518
I should have got
a better bottle of wine.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.657
So, what did you want
to tell me?Oh, it's not important.

10:57.700 --> 11:00.442
Really? It seemed
like a big deal.I said it's not important, okay?

11:01.443 --> 11:02.487
Whoa.

11:02.531 --> 11:03.793
What was that?

11:03.837 --> 11:05.316
Nothing. Sorry.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.840
You mad at me?

11:06.883 --> 11:08.319
No, of course not.

11:08.363 --> 11:09.669
Please, eat.

11:09.712 --> 11:11.801
We have to celebrate
your good fortune.

11:11.845 --> 11:13.368
Okay.

11:14.369 --> 11:15.849
I'm just a little off today.

11:15.892 --> 11:17.851
Maybe my new meds.

11:17.894 --> 11:19.287
Sure.

11:20.723 --> 11:24.205
Would you feel better
if I bought you a car?

11:25.206 --> 11:26.163
Very funny.

11:26.207 --> 11:27.861
Wait, would you actually...

11:28.557 --> 11:29.819
No. My Civic's fine.

11:29.863 --> 11:31.691
A car you can trust.

11:31.734 --> 11:35.346
So, what are you gonna
do with all this money?

11:35.390 --> 11:37.435
Oh, I have no idea.

11:37.479 --> 11:40.177
My whole life,
I've barely ever had $48,

11:40.221 --> 11:42.876
and now I have
$48 million.

11:42.919 --> 11:44.834
$24 million. Don't
forget the taxes.

11:44.878 --> 11:46.531
Mm.

11:46.575 --> 11:48.838
What if I don't pay them?
What are they gonna do to me?

11:48.882 --> 11:50.710
Put you in jail.
[laughs]:
For taxes?

11:50.753 --> 11:53.190
No, I don't think so.

11:53.234 --> 11:54.583
Hey.

11:54.626 --> 11:56.063
Will you do me a favor?

11:56.106 --> 11:58.065
Don't tell anybody
about the money.

11:58.108 --> 11:59.370
Especially Eli.

11:59.414 --> 12:00.632
Yeah, sure.

12:00.676 --> 12:02.896
Is everything okay
with you guys?

12:02.939 --> 12:04.114
Oh, I don't know.

12:04.158 --> 12:06.203
Ever since he asked me
to move in

12:06.247 --> 12:08.728
and I decided to stay here,
it's been weird.

12:08.771 --> 12:11.774
Well, I'm sure you kids
will figure it out.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.776
Or not.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.735
I guess.

12:15.778 --> 12:17.737
I'll probably
move out anyway.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.216
Really?

12:19.260 --> 12:21.392
Well, yeah. I mean,
millionaires usually have

12:21.436 --> 12:23.090
their own places, don't they?

12:23.133 --> 12:27.616
Lady Gaga, Batman,
they all have their own places.

12:28.617 --> 12:29.879
Makes sense.

12:29.923 --> 12:31.751
Well, I'm gonna miss you.

12:32.795 --> 12:34.754
I'm gonna miss you, too.

12:36.799 --> 12:38.453
Bon appétit.

12:41.499 --> 12:44.938
What do you know
about offshore tax shelters?

12:46.635 --> 12:48.593
Can I get you anything,
Norma?
No.

12:48.637 --> 12:50.421
Cup or tea, maybe?No, thank you.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.423
How about a bagel?
You like bagels.I have no money

12:52.467 --> 12:54.425
to leave you, Gabby.

12:54.469 --> 12:55.905
[door closes]

12:55.949 --> 12:58.299
Hey.
What are you
doing here?

12:58.342 --> 13:00.431
Uh, I work here.You also have

13:00.475 --> 13:02.303
$48 million.

13:03.173 --> 13:05.088
$24 million after taxes.

13:05.132 --> 13:06.655
Mm, we'll see.

13:06.698 --> 13:08.918
Hey, how are you
feeling?

13:08.962 --> 13:11.660
Like my hip is made
of broken glass.

13:11.703 --> 13:13.836
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you taking your pain meds?

13:13.880 --> 13:14.924
Sometimes.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.317
Norma, come on.

13:16.360 --> 13:17.797
I don't like the way
they make me feel.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.277
I get all sleepy and spaced out.

13:20.321 --> 13:23.628
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

13:23.672 --> 13:25.935
Well, at least let me get you
some Tylenol or something.

13:25.979 --> 13:26.980
I'm fine.

13:27.023 --> 13:28.851
Just leave me alone.Hey,

13:28.895 --> 13:30.679
I know you're not feeling well,
but don't take it out on me.

13:30.722 --> 13:31.985
Who should I take it out on?

13:32.028 --> 13:32.986
Gabby.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.640
She's no good.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.338
Hey, get her
some Tylenol.

13:37.381 --> 13:40.210
Sure. Norma, I'm gonna
get you some Tylenol...

13:40.254 --> 13:43.344
I have no money, Gabby.

13:45.520 --> 13:46.869
So...

13:46.913 --> 13:48.305
how is it being rich?

13:48.349 --> 13:51.134
Oh, it's confusing.

13:51.178 --> 13:53.658
I don't feel like
I deserve it.

13:53.702 --> 13:55.008
Why? Why not you?

13:55.051 --> 13:57.140
You were very kind to that man.

13:57.184 --> 13:59.882
You took time to listen
to his stories,

13:59.926 --> 14:02.363
take him to the doctor,
get his hair cut.

14:02.406 --> 14:03.973
That's just my job.No, no, no.

14:04.017 --> 14:05.975
It was much more than your job.

14:06.019 --> 14:07.977
You cared about him.

14:08.021 --> 14:11.372
You have any idea
how much that means around here?

14:11.415 --> 14:13.853
I'm gonna miss him.

14:13.896 --> 14:16.203
Yeah. Me, too, honey.

14:16.246 --> 14:19.032
GABBY:
Here you go, Norma.Thanks.

14:19.075 --> 14:22.252
Uh, uh, Mrs. Prufrock,
cup of tea? Bagel?

14:22.296 --> 14:24.080
Wait, slow down.

14:27.214 --> 14:28.693
Can I help you?

14:28.737 --> 14:30.870
Yes. Um, I'm not sure
if you remember me,

14:30.913 --> 14:33.873
but I bought a burial plot
from you about a year ago.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.526
Oh, sure.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.702
Mr., uh, Dunlop, right?

14:37.746 --> 14:39.356
[chuckles]
Dunbar. But close.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.402
Right. Darn.
[laughs]

14:41.445 --> 14:44.187
Well, what can I do for you,
Mr. Dunbar?

14:44.231 --> 14:46.189
Well, uh, this
is gonna sound a little odd,

14:46.233 --> 14:49.410
but I was wondering if
the cemetery might buy it back?

14:50.411 --> 14:51.586
Why?

14:51.629 --> 14:54.023
Are you unhappy with it?

14:54.067 --> 14:55.938
No, it's a great plot.Yeah.

14:55.982 --> 14:58.288
If I recall, it's on a hilltop
under a copse of trees.

14:58.332 --> 15:00.377
Terrific view.

15:00.421 --> 15:01.901
Yeah. Very picturesque.

15:01.944 --> 15:04.599
It's just, the thing is,

15:04.642 --> 15:07.645
when I bought it
I wasn't doing so well, and...

15:07.689 --> 15:09.038
Don't tell me.

15:09.082 --> 15:10.561
You decided on cremation?

15:10.605 --> 15:12.389
You're gonna do the,
uh, environmental,

15:12.433 --> 15:13.956
ashes-in-the-ocean thing?

15:14.000 --> 15:16.219
I got to tell you,
not really good for the fish.

15:16.263 --> 15:18.221
No. No cremation.

15:18.265 --> 15:20.223
[chuckles]
No, th-the thing is...

15:20.267 --> 15:22.965
I got a kidney transplant,
and I'm looking

15:23.009 --> 15:24.619
to live a lot longer.

15:25.620 --> 15:26.969
Well, uh...

15:27.013 --> 15:29.276
[clears throat]
good for you.

15:29.319 --> 15:30.755
Thanks.Yeah, sure,

15:30.799 --> 15:31.931
we'll buy it back.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.062
Great.But I got to tell you,

15:33.106 --> 15:35.064
you lose half your investment.

15:35.108 --> 15:36.457
Why?

15:36.500 --> 15:37.937
Well, think of it like
a car purchase.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.460
The second
you drive it off the lot...

15:39.503 --> 15:41.766
[clicks tongue]
loses 50% of its value.

15:41.810 --> 15:43.246
But I haven't driven it
anywhere.

15:43.290 --> 15:45.292
It's just grass and dirt.Well, I'm sorry,

15:45.335 --> 15:46.641
it's considered a used plot

15:46.684 --> 15:48.077
whether you're lying in it
or not.

15:48.121 --> 15:49.252
Now,

15:49.296 --> 15:50.601
if you'll excuse me,

15:50.645 --> 15:52.603
I have people
who are not as lucky as you

15:52.647 --> 15:54.823
who need to be put
to their eternal rest.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.479
Can I at least sublet it?

15:58.522 --> 16:00.568
[phone vibrating]

16:02.004 --> 16:03.614
Hey, Eli.

16:03.658 --> 16:06.487
Hey, let me ask you-- how
are you fixed for a burial plot?

16:07.531 --> 16:08.968
What?A burial plot.

16:09.011 --> 16:11.448
You know,
a headstone, flowers...

16:11.492 --> 16:14.147
enough room
for a tasteful crypt.

16:15.148 --> 16:17.454
I'm good, Drew.

16:17.498 --> 16:20.675
Listen, has Gina said anything
about me lately?

16:20.718 --> 16:22.024
No. Why do you ask?

16:22.068 --> 16:23.634
I haven't heard from her

16:23.678 --> 16:25.288
the last couple of days,
and to be honest with you,

16:25.332 --> 16:27.290
things have been... weird.

16:27.334 --> 16:28.813
Really?

16:28.857 --> 16:30.641
Is she seeing someone else?

16:30.685 --> 16:32.295
Not that I'm aware of.

16:32.339 --> 16:35.690
But who knows with women.
They are the original deceivers.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.215
I always felt like I was
a little bit more into her

16:39.259 --> 16:41.304
than she was into me, you know?

16:41.348 --> 16:42.305
Maybe.

16:42.349 --> 16:44.003
What does your gut tell you?

16:44.046 --> 16:46.353
Part of me says I should
just break it off.

16:46.396 --> 16:50.139
Hi. We're hoping to buy
a cemetery plot.

16:50.183 --> 16:51.749
Oh, uh, got to go, Eli.

16:51.793 --> 16:53.838
Trust your gut. Dump her.

16:53.882 --> 16:55.318
Come with me.

16:55.362 --> 16:57.712
I want to show you something
with a view.

17:01.281 --> 17:02.717
Shoes.

17:03.718 --> 17:04.893
Hmm.

17:04.936 --> 17:06.808
[forced gasp]
And more shoes.

17:07.765 --> 17:08.853
Ooh...

17:08.897 --> 17:10.942
Look. Shoes!

17:10.986 --> 17:12.596
What is this one?

17:12.640 --> 17:14.729
[forced gasp]
What do you know? Shoes!

17:15.730 --> 17:17.079
Hey.Hey.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.081
Shoes!

17:19.125 --> 17:20.865
Did a little
shopping, huh?

17:20.909 --> 17:23.694
I was feeling a little sad
this afternoon-- shoes!--

17:23.738 --> 17:25.174
so I decided

17:25.218 --> 17:27.176
to spend some money--
bought some shoes.

17:27.220 --> 17:28.612
Shoes!

17:28.656 --> 17:30.353
I see.

17:30.397 --> 17:32.094
Also bought a couple
of Birkin bags-- they're, like,

17:32.138 --> 17:35.358
$30,000 each, which is totally
obscene until you own one,

17:35.402 --> 17:37.447
and then they're
pretty wonderful.

17:37.491 --> 17:38.927
You want one?

17:38.970 --> 17:41.060
I think you could pull it off.

17:42.104 --> 17:43.105
No, thanks.

17:43.149 --> 17:44.367
Tomorrow
I'm going into the city,

17:44.411 --> 17:46.065
and I'm buying a condo.

17:46.108 --> 17:48.110
Maybe two condos.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.112
One for my shoes.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.201
Y-You're gonna live
in Manhattan?

17:52.245 --> 17:55.117
[panting]:
I could. I don't have to.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.554
I can... go wherever I want.

17:57.598 --> 18:00.079
[crying]:
Wherever makes me happy.

18:00.122 --> 18:01.428
[chuckling, crying]

18:01.471 --> 18:03.560
That's what I'm gonna be.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.823
[sobbing]:
Happy!

18:07.129 --> 18:09.436
I don't know what's happening!

18:09.479 --> 18:11.090
[groans]

18:11.133 --> 18:12.743
Aah. Ow!

18:12.787 --> 18:14.484
Sorry. Louboutin.

18:15.485 --> 18:18.445
Look, everything's gonna
be okay. You'll see.

18:18.488 --> 18:20.099
Will it? I don't know!

18:20.142 --> 18:21.578
I don't know anything!

18:21.622 --> 18:23.406
Okay?!

18:23.450 --> 18:26.322
I thought buying all this stuff
would make me feel better,

18:26.366 --> 18:29.238
and it did, and then...
and then it didn't.

18:29.282 --> 18:31.501
It just makes me...

18:31.545 --> 18:33.416
I don't know what I am.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.462
You're just
a little overwhelmed.

18:35.505 --> 18:37.464
And that's
perfectly understandable.

18:37.507 --> 18:39.248
How come I feel so awful?

18:39.292 --> 18:40.771
What is wrong with me?

18:40.815 --> 18:42.686
Oh, nothing
is wrong with you.

18:42.730 --> 18:44.253
[shudders]:
Oh...

18:44.297 --> 18:48.127
Are there support groups
for rich, unhappy people?

18:48.170 --> 18:50.955
Not unless you want
to become a Republican.

18:50.999 --> 18:53.175
But, hey, look,
the good news is,

18:53.219 --> 18:55.525
you have someone in your life
who will care for you

18:55.569 --> 18:58.267
no matter what, who can be
your support system, your...

18:58.311 --> 19:00.530
your-your partner, even.

19:01.879 --> 19:03.620
[ringtone playing]

19:03.664 --> 19:05.144
It's Eli.

19:05.187 --> 19:07.494
You should get that.

19:08.669 --> 19:11.280
[clears throat]
Hi.

19:11.324 --> 19:13.195
Yeah, sure,
what's up?

19:14.327 --> 19:15.893
[sighs]

19:15.937 --> 19:18.026
Yeah, I know, things
have been kind of awkward.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.856
Really? A weekend in Vermont?

19:22.857 --> 19:24.380
That sounds great.

19:24.424 --> 19:26.295
I could use a break.

19:26.339 --> 19:27.818
Oh, no, everything's fine.

19:27.862 --> 19:29.472
I'll-I'll tell you about it
over the weekend.

19:29.516 --> 19:31.387
Okay.

19:31.431 --> 19:33.607
Thanks. Bye.

19:35.565 --> 19:37.480
You guys are going to Vermont?

19:37.524 --> 19:39.178
Yeah, bed-and-breakfast.

19:39.221 --> 19:41.832
He wants to start over,
get back to where we were.

19:41.876 --> 19:43.051
[high-pitched]:
Great. Great.

19:45.053 --> 19:49.013
Hey. Thanks for letting
me vent all over you.

19:49.057 --> 19:51.494
You're my best buddy.

19:51.538 --> 19:52.843
Yeah.

19:52.887 --> 19:55.585
I haven't heard that
since prom night.

20:06.248 --> 20:08.337
It's 3:00 in the morning.

20:08.381 --> 20:11.384
Sorry, I didn't know
where else to go.

20:11.427 --> 20:12.559
What's going on?

20:13.821 --> 20:16.389
[sighs]
I'm in love with Gina.

20:17.390 --> 20:19.696
What...?

20:19.740 --> 20:21.829
She's the one. I'm sure of it.

20:22.917 --> 20:25.398
All right. Come talk to Gideon.

20:33.275 --> 20:35.625
How do you know where I live?
