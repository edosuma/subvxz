00:00.106 --> 00:01.988
Previously on Switched at Birth...

00:02.025 --> 00:03.210
We'd like to have you back in the group.

00:03.789 --> 00:06.540
You mean, me and my advanced notes.

00:06.576 --> 00:08.542
They'd be helpful.

00:08.578 --> 00:10.744
I really want to kiss you.

00:10.796 --> 00:11.812
Yes.

00:16.239 --> 00:18.239
Your dad and I think it's
time you started paying

00:18.241 --> 00:19.407
for your insurance and your phone.

00:19.409 --> 00:21.409
You're not living under
our roof anymore, and...

00:21.444 --> 00:23.210
I'm on a really tight budget.

00:23.246 --> 00:25.329
I'm doing the best that I can
with what I'm making right now.

00:25.381 --> 00:28.382
I want us to be like we were.

00:28.383 --> 00:29.520
_

00:29.552 --> 00:32.420
Let's just say this
long-distance thing sucks.

00:32.421 --> 00:34.305
On the bright side, we're at a party,

00:34.340 --> 00:35.589
we are not under house arrest.

00:35.641 --> 00:37.641
- To the night!
- To the night!

00:37.677 --> 00:39.226
Yeah.

01:41.360 --> 01:42.609
Honey?

01:45.531 --> 01:47.614
I crashed in Daphne's room.

01:47.666 --> 01:49.666
Yeah, well, you still have to call us.

01:49.701 --> 01:51.418
I know. I'm sorry.

01:51.453 --> 01:53.587
Oh well, I guess you
had a lot to celebrate.

01:53.622 --> 01:56.206
You got your ankle thing
off, and Emmett was in town.

01:57.476 --> 01:59.676
I'm glad you did the
responsible thing by not driving.

02:01.296 --> 02:03.430
I just hope you weren't over-celebrating.

02:03.465 --> 02:05.348
- (Rock music playing)
- To freedom!

02:05.384 --> 02:06.633
To freedom!

02:06.685 --> 02:08.602
(All cheering)

02:10.639 --> 02:12.389
I wasn't.

02:12.441 --> 02:14.391
Do you want some toast or some cereal?

02:14.393 --> 02:15.609
I've got a little frittata left.

02:15.644 --> 02:17.561
I'm not really hungry.

02:17.563 --> 02:19.479
Doesn't community service start soon?

02:19.531 --> 02:21.431
You better get going. I'm so glad

02:21.466 --> 02:23.567
you got your license back.

02:23.569 --> 02:27.287
Oh, your brother came
up with the funniest idea

02:27.322 --> 02:30.240
for a number; Wives versus girlfriends

02:30.242 --> 02:32.275
in a dance off.

02:32.311 --> 02:35.545
<i>Kathryn: ♪ the K.C. Royals
are a beautiful team ♪</i>

02:35.581 --> 02:37.414
<i>♪ they're out of my league but hey ♪</i>

02:37.449 --> 02:40.450
<i>♪ a girl can dream ♪</i>

02:40.469 --> 02:41.551
Hey, mom.

02:43.589 --> 02:45.305
What?

02:51.680 --> 02:53.430
I really like the song.

02:55.567 --> 02:57.267
Professor Marillo: Uh-huh.

02:57.269 --> 03:00.403
Have you chosen your element
for your final group project?

03:00.439 --> 03:01.571
Yes, fluorine.

03:01.607 --> 03:03.440
I was thinking cobalt.

03:03.492 --> 03:06.243
But then we talked about how one
element can impact a lifetime.

03:06.278 --> 03:08.612
Like, my mother, who grew up
without fluoride in the water,

03:08.647 --> 03:11.364
and now has a lifetime of dental problems.

03:11.416 --> 03:14.584
I always applaud making chemistry personal.

03:14.620 --> 03:17.487
I mean, our whole lives
are shaped by chemistry.

03:17.522 --> 03:19.372
It's endlessly fascinating.

03:21.677 --> 03:24.461
I was gonna propose lithium,
because of my medication.

03:25.530 --> 03:27.264
That's a joke. That's...

03:27.299 --> 03:30.267
The point is, this is
a collaboration, okay?

03:30.302 --> 03:33.303
Keep talking and get your
proposal to me by Wednesday.

03:33.305 --> 03:35.605
So, for the group project, we
all get the same grade, right?

03:35.641 --> 03:38.241
All for one, one for all.

03:38.277 --> 03:40.710
And if someone wanted to
do their own project, too,

03:40.746 --> 03:42.379
to supplement their grade?

03:42.414 --> 03:44.314
She's afraid we're gonna drag her down.

03:44.316 --> 03:46.449
No, no, no. It's just...

03:46.485 --> 03:49.286
if there were other elements
that we wanted to work on?

03:49.321 --> 03:52.389
I'm sorry, is this something you
could discuss during your own time

03:52.424 --> 03:54.257
and not our group review?

03:54.293 --> 03:56.201
- It's just a question.
- You know what?

03:56.236 --> 03:57.235
Let's end here.

03:57.287 --> 03:59.237
(Stammers)

03:59.289 --> 04:00.538
Was there anything else for the group?

04:00.574 --> 04:03.241
No, no, thanks. I've got
all the information I need.

04:04.294 --> 04:05.327
(Door opens)

04:05.379 --> 04:07.329
I'm so sorry. (Panting)

04:07.331 --> 04:10.632
I, uh, my seminar ran late, and the bus...

04:10.667 --> 04:12.584
It's okay. I think I got it.

04:12.636 --> 04:14.419
We're done, so...

04:14.471 --> 04:16.338
Daphne and Vimla, um...

04:17.474 --> 04:19.507
I'm having a small gathering

04:19.509 --> 04:20.642
at my home tonight.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.677
Attendance is optional, of course.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.346
We start at 7:00.

04:25.515 --> 04:30.318
And my husband has this thing
about shoes in the house.

04:31.355 --> 04:33.271
- Mr. Padden.
- Professor.

04:37.361 --> 04:40.412
I'm guessing you know this,
but attendance is not optional.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.282
Thanks a lot.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.587
Why does she act like it's my fault?

05:00.467 --> 05:03.468
- Hey!
- Oh! Could you not torture me today?

05:03.520 --> 05:05.220
I'm really not in the mood.

05:05.272 --> 05:06.388
Jeez, okay.

05:06.390 --> 05:07.439
How much did you have anyway?

05:07.474 --> 05:08.640
Are you even allowed to drink with that...

05:08.692 --> 05:11.476
Oh, government ball and chain is gone.

05:11.528 --> 05:12.610
Congrats.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.279
Thanks.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.531
My boyfriend came into town to surprise me.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.617
Lucky, it sounds like
you got a really good guy.

05:22.406 --> 05:23.488
Yeah, I am lucky.

05:26.243 --> 05:27.242
(Phone vibrating)

05:27.244 --> 05:28.410
You guys have a fight or something?

05:28.462 --> 05:30.211
(Sighs)

05:32.802 --> 05:34.102
_

05:34.501 --> 05:36.551
- That him?
- Uh, no.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.636
(Stammers) It's, uh...

05:40.507 --> 05:41.589
It's a different guy.

05:42.726 --> 05:44.559
Oh, it's like that.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.428
Hey, you know what? No.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.230
Not like that.

05:50.434 --> 05:51.599
At least I don't want it to be.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.353
I love my boyfriend. I
don't know how this happened.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.573
Seven shots is usually how.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.159
I didn't even drink that much.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.193
Right.

06:03.246 --> 06:04.446
I don't remember it being that much.

06:07.250 --> 06:09.167
I've been there.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.502
Not proud of it, but it happens.

06:10.537 --> 06:14.622
But I'm not even sure what happened.

06:19.629 --> 06:22.297
I remember...

06:22.349 --> 06:25.216
up to a point, but then nothing.

06:26.470 --> 06:27.469
Man.

06:29.706 --> 06:31.356
You think you and this guy...

06:33.610 --> 06:34.642
I don't know.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.316
I woke up next to him,

06:41.318 --> 06:43.485
and my clothes were off,
but that could mean anything.

06:43.537 --> 06:47.238
Right? I mean... like, it
doesn't necessarily mean...

06:47.290 --> 06:49.290
for sure...

06:49.326 --> 06:51.259
First of all, you better
hope he used a condom

06:51.294 --> 06:53.328
because that's basically how
I got knocked up with Sam.

06:53.330 --> 06:54.529
Oh God.

06:54.564 --> 06:55.547
Second of all,

06:55.582 --> 06:58.383
a girl wakes up wasted
with her underwear off?

06:58.418 --> 07:00.335
In my experience, not
a whole lot of mystery

07:00.337 --> 07:01.469
about what happened.

07:01.505 --> 07:03.638
Gordon: Kennish, Ritter, this way.

07:06.343 --> 07:08.226
But, hey...

07:08.261 --> 07:09.310
What do I know?

07:15.235 --> 07:16.601
(Bells chime)

07:18.688 --> 07:20.238
(Door opens)

07:21.274 --> 07:22.357
That looks cool.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.527
- Hi.
- Hey.

07:25.529 --> 07:28.196
I was checking out the
competition over at Lupe's Bakery.

07:28.248 --> 07:31.332
I hope you like murals.

07:31.368 --> 07:32.667
I like this one.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.669
I figured we could cover
up some water damage

07:34.704 --> 07:37.238
and build community
spirit at the same time.

07:38.592 --> 07:39.674
Dig the efficiency.

07:41.378 --> 07:42.427
Oh...

07:44.347 --> 07:45.430
Also...

07:45.465 --> 07:47.515
I wanted to say...

07:47.551 --> 07:49.284
what happened between us...

07:49.319 --> 07:50.418
Yep.

07:53.390 --> 07:56.224
... was impulsive and
totally unprofessional of me

07:56.226 --> 07:57.258
and won't happen again.

07:58.361 --> 07:59.444
Really?

07:59.479 --> 08:00.495
Yes.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.482
Am I allowed to say that I'm disappointed?

08:08.438 --> 08:09.571
- You're blushing.
- (Laughs)

08:11.208 --> 08:13.274
I just needed to get it over with.

08:13.310 --> 08:15.243
You flatterer.

08:15.295 --> 08:18.513
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it to
sound like that. It's just...

08:21.251 --> 08:23.251
It was the first time since Angelo.

08:24.304 --> 08:25.637
Oh, I get it.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.422
You wanted to lose your widow virginity.

08:28.592 --> 08:30.458
Well, I only feel slightly used.

08:30.493 --> 08:32.342
(Sighs) Oh God, I'm so sorry.

08:32.395 --> 08:33.595
(Laughs)

08:33.647 --> 08:34.596
I'm kidding.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.181
Relax.

08:40.236 --> 08:43.238
I just would hate to think that
I ruined our working relationship.

08:43.273 --> 08:44.505
Hey...

08:44.541 --> 08:45.607
Water under the bridge.

08:45.609 --> 08:47.408
Yes.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.279
Hi!

08:51.314 --> 08:53.197
Do I have time to change
out of my work clothes?

08:53.250 --> 08:54.682
It's just grill night. You look great.

08:54.718 --> 08:56.517
You do realize you're not
actually looking at me?

08:58.371 --> 08:59.487
Sorry.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.172
You look gorgeous,

09:01.207 --> 09:02.557
and kind of Republican,

09:02.592 --> 09:04.542
which is totally gonna
be a plus with my dad.

09:04.594 --> 09:06.411
Thank you. I think.

09:06.481 --> 09:10.200
Hold on a second, I just gotta
place a bid on this Corolla.

09:10.235 --> 09:11.451
Oh, what's wrong with the BMW?

09:11.486 --> 09:14.454
$350 a month for car insurance.

09:14.489 --> 09:16.539
Other than that, it's a
feat of German engineering,

09:16.575 --> 09:18.458
and selling it is gonna be like

09:18.493 --> 09:20.577
cutting out my own heart on a Mayan altar.

09:20.612 --> 09:22.161
(Chuckles)

09:22.214 --> 09:23.463
That's a really overdone metaphor,

09:23.498 --> 09:26.299
and I think you mean Aztecs.

09:26.334 --> 09:28.167
I love dating a school teacher.

09:28.220 --> 09:30.553
Well, I'm not a school teacher
anymore, I'm an administrator.

09:30.589 --> 09:32.255
(Chuckles)

09:33.425 --> 09:35.225
Do you really need to sell your car?

09:36.394 --> 09:39.479
Well, if I want to cover
all my expenses plus rent.

09:39.514 --> 09:42.232
It's just until the fall parties kick in,

09:42.267 --> 09:46.603
and supposedly I'm getting paid at some point
for this musical that I'm writing with my mom...

09:46.638 --> 09:48.404
Which I can't believe I'm doing.

09:48.440 --> 09:49.439
Why don't you let me help you.

09:49.441 --> 09:50.523
Write the musical?

09:50.575 --> 09:53.192
No, silly. Cover your expenses.

09:53.245 --> 09:55.178
(Laughs) Uh, no.

09:55.213 --> 09:56.279
Why not?

09:56.314 --> 09:58.214
I'm not having my girlfriend pay my rent.

09:58.250 --> 10:00.283
That's worse than my parents paying it.

10:00.318 --> 10:01.534
Well, you'd do it for me, wouldn't you?

10:01.586 --> 10:03.286
Of course, but...

10:03.338 --> 10:06.205
Oh, women can need help,
but men can't, is that it?

10:06.258 --> 10:07.590
Something like that.

10:07.626 --> 10:09.542
Well, now you're gonna have to accept
just to prove you're not sexist.

10:11.379 --> 10:12.512
Seriously, no.

10:12.547 --> 10:14.464
I've got a job. You're gonna pay me back.

10:14.499 --> 10:16.466
It's no problem. Look,
how much is your rent?

10:18.436 --> 10:19.552
This is a really bad idea.

10:21.606 --> 10:23.306
Two words.

10:23.308 --> 10:24.307
Heated seats.

10:26.278 --> 10:27.443
Three.

10:27.479 --> 10:29.362
Premium sound system.

10:31.616 --> 10:33.483
Toby, I'm happy to do this.

10:37.455 --> 10:39.322
- It's $500, right?
- (Sighs)

10:40.659 --> 10:42.292
$600 with utilities.

10:42.327 --> 10:44.327
(Bells tolling distantly)

11:09.354 --> 11:10.520
Hey.

11:10.572 --> 11:11.571
Hey.

11:15.527 --> 11:17.360
So, this is weird.

11:18.530 --> 11:19.529
Yeah.

11:20.565 --> 11:23.266
Uh, listen, I just want to say

11:23.301 --> 11:25.451
I know you probably think
last night was a mistake.

11:25.503 --> 11:27.537
Yeah, I kind of came out of nowhere.

11:27.539 --> 11:29.205
Well, I always wanted it to happen,

11:29.257 --> 11:31.441
but I didn't expect...

11:31.476 --> 11:33.176
so...

11:33.211 --> 11:34.577
We did?

11:34.612 --> 11:36.379
Well, yeah.

11:36.414 --> 11:38.381
Oh God...

11:38.383 --> 11:40.266
Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God.

11:40.301 --> 11:41.351
Whoa, hold on.

11:41.386 --> 11:42.385
Did we use anything?

11:42.437 --> 11:44.437
Yes, of course. Jeez.

11:44.472 --> 11:46.556
This cannot have happened.

11:46.558 --> 11:49.225
Okay, you don't have to
act like having sex with me

11:49.227 --> 11:50.493
is, like, the grossest thing on the planet.

11:52.564 --> 11:53.613
Look...

11:53.648 --> 11:55.615
I'm not gonna tell anyone what happened.

11:55.650 --> 11:58.234
That's not what...

11:58.236 --> 11:59.569
it's not just about Emmett.

12:00.638 --> 12:02.271
We were safe.

12:02.307 --> 12:04.240
No one ever has to know.
What's the big deal?

12:06.544 --> 12:08.127
I have to go.

12:16.934 --> 12:18.767
Should I bake something?

12:18.769 --> 12:19.818
Is that too girly?

12:19.853 --> 12:21.736
I don't want to try too hard.

12:21.772 --> 12:23.905
What if no one else brings anything?

12:24.942 --> 12:26.775
Maybe I'll bring wine. Is that weird?

12:26.827 --> 12:27.943
Relax.

12:27.945 --> 12:29.694
Marillo invited you to her house.

12:29.746 --> 12:31.830
That's obviously a privilege of some kind.

12:31.865 --> 12:33.865
But why? I got a D on my first exam.

12:33.917 --> 12:35.834
A D!

12:35.869 --> 12:38.920
What if this is the official
meeting before she kicks people out?

12:38.956 --> 12:40.872
Well, she asked Vimla.

12:42.543 --> 12:44.593
No, not like she...

12:44.628 --> 12:46.711
It's fine. I know she's
doing way better than me.

12:48.181 --> 12:50.849
Do you know that she didn't even
make honors society in high school?

12:51.935 --> 12:53.668
Oh, you did not look that up.

12:56.640 --> 12:58.723
Just focus on Marillo, okay?

12:58.775 --> 13:00.775
This is an opportunity
to make a connection.

13:01.812 --> 13:03.862
But you're coming, right?

13:03.897 --> 13:04.946
(Laughs) Um...

13:04.982 --> 13:07.899
Isn't this more of like a social thing?

13:07.951 --> 13:10.652
I don't know. That's the point.

13:10.654 --> 13:13.538
Yeah, I don't think you want me with you

13:13.574 --> 13:14.739
in Marillo's house.

13:14.791 --> 13:16.708
What happened between you two?

13:17.995 --> 13:19.744
Trust me, Dumbo.

13:19.796 --> 13:21.546
You don't need the feather to fly.

13:22.666 --> 13:23.748
You'll be fine.

13:33.844 --> 13:35.894
Hey, it's everyone's favorite felon.

13:35.929 --> 13:37.512
You're just in time.

13:38.515 --> 13:39.814
Oh, grill night.

13:39.850 --> 13:42.517
I was just about to go talk to mom.

13:43.854 --> 13:47.522
Lily is out back doing the serious
charm offensive on her and dad.

13:47.574 --> 13:50.659
Soon we will eat the sacrificial cow.

13:53.864 --> 13:56.831
Oh, looks like someone did a
little bit too much imbibing

13:56.867 --> 13:58.833
of the liquid of the gods last night.

13:58.869 --> 14:00.468
Did Tank say something?

14:01.505 --> 14:03.538
No, just a guess. Why? Did
you see Tank last night?

14:04.591 --> 14:07.459
(Stammers) I'm just
gonna go talk to Regina.

14:07.511 --> 14:09.928
Could you just tell them?

14:09.963 --> 14:11.880
Yeah. Everything okay?

14:11.932 --> 14:13.632
Yeah.

14:13.684 --> 14:14.799
See you later.

14:18.972 --> 14:22.557
So I'm in the middle of this lovely
interaction with a board member,

14:22.559 --> 14:24.609
who's so enthusiastic about the program,

14:24.645 --> 14:25.944
and I'm thinking, "this is brilliant."

14:25.979 --> 14:27.729
"We're gonna get so much support."

14:27.731 --> 14:30.732
Then she starts talking about her
brother, who is a funeral director,

14:30.784 --> 14:33.535
and how she's always thought
it was a noble profession,

14:33.570 --> 14:34.736
and I realized

14:34.738 --> 14:36.788
she thinks I've said "death program."

14:36.823 --> 14:37.939
(All chuckling)

14:37.974 --> 14:40.575
Well, in case you ever want to diversify.

14:41.745 --> 14:43.495
You know, even without the support,

14:43.547 --> 14:44.796
it's amazing how much you've done.

14:44.831 --> 14:46.548
Oh, I feel really lucky.

14:46.583 --> 14:49.584
I mean, most people I went to grad school
with are still on their first teaching job.

14:49.586 --> 14:50.802
Well,

14:50.837 --> 14:51.886
you hear that, Tob?

14:51.922 --> 14:54.923
Higher education leading
to professional opportunity.

14:55.926 --> 14:57.425
Loud and clear, dad.

14:57.477 --> 14:59.894
You know, Toby was accepted to Wash U.

14:59.930 --> 15:02.847
Yep, they just didn't
offer a degree in DJ'ing.

15:03.934 --> 15:06.484
I am so ready for steak. Who's with me?

15:06.520 --> 15:09.604
I think Toby is a person
of tremendous potential.

15:09.656 --> 15:10.855
I'll drink to that.

15:10.907 --> 15:12.691
Potential to rock your party.

15:13.944 --> 15:14.943
Speaking of which,

15:14.945 --> 15:16.695
I gotta check on that turntable.

15:16.747 --> 15:18.830
You know what? That's
one thing I'll never get.

15:18.865 --> 15:21.583
How much equipment does
one DJ actually need?

15:22.619 --> 15:24.536
Yeah, I have to wonder the same.

15:27.624 --> 15:28.707
What turntable?

15:28.759 --> 15:30.792
It's a Japanese thing.

15:30.794 --> 15:32.844
That something you really need?

15:35.515 --> 15:36.731
It's a business investment.

15:36.767 --> 15:38.633
Toby: This is how I make money.

15:38.685 --> 15:40.802
(Chattering quietly)

15:40.804 --> 15:42.554
You know what? We need to get some salad.

15:42.606 --> 15:43.638
Salad's here.

15:43.640 --> 15:45.607
You know, we need more salad.

15:45.642 --> 15:46.641
(Sighs) Okay.

15:52.749 --> 15:54.532
Hi. It's apple cider.

15:54.568 --> 15:55.784
Oh, how autumnal.

15:55.819 --> 15:56.818
Thank you.

15:56.820 --> 15:58.453
Shoes, please.

15:58.488 --> 16:00.822
Oh, where did you get a
periodic table welcome mat?

16:01.825 --> 16:04.659
I seem to be a target for nerd gifts.

16:04.711 --> 16:07.629
It's the perils of a life
in science, I suppose.

16:07.664 --> 16:08.897
- (Laughs)
- Come in.

16:15.639 --> 16:16.888
Have we figured out why we're here yet?

16:16.923 --> 16:18.556
Nope.

16:18.592 --> 16:21.760
Well, since we've all
gathered, let's get started.

16:21.812 --> 16:24.846
<i>Thank you for trekking to Casa Marillo.</i>

16:24.848 --> 16:27.482
Every year, I like to
pick a handful of students

16:27.517 --> 16:30.652
and have them over for my
personal favorite dessert,

16:30.687 --> 16:31.736
ice cream.

16:31.772 --> 16:35.924
Now, any comp lit major can eat ice cream.

16:35.959 --> 16:38.610
Since you're scientists,

16:38.662 --> 16:41.563
I thought you could make some.

16:43.083 --> 16:46.618
There are five of you. There are more
than five ways of making ice cream,

16:46.670 --> 16:47.869
and you've got everything you need.

16:47.871 --> 16:50.538
So, I'll come back in half an hour

16:50.590 --> 16:51.840
and see what you've come up with.

16:51.875 --> 16:53.942
And yes...

16:53.977 --> 16:57.545
you could look up how to
do this on your phones,

16:57.581 --> 17:02.684
but did sir Isaac Newton look
up gravity on his smart phone?

17:05.722 --> 17:06.721
Can I ask a question?

17:06.772 --> 17:08.690
No. No questions.

17:08.724 --> 17:11.643
Just make sure that you
follow the safety instructions

17:11.694 --> 17:12.727
with the liquid nitrogen...

17:12.779 --> 17:15.530
goggles and gloves at all times.

17:15.565 --> 17:16.815
Great.

17:16.867 --> 17:18.733
Well, see you at 7:30.

17:28.745 --> 17:29.911
Looks like you're pretty
handy with a grill.

17:31.665 --> 17:34.582
Gotta do something to realize
all this untapped potential.

17:35.836 --> 17:38.636
Was that such a bad thing to
say? You do have potential.

17:38.672 --> 17:40.922
Which we all know is code
for "nothing going on."

17:40.924 --> 17:43.808
So, if my job doesn't look like yours,

17:43.844 --> 17:45.727
then it's not legitimate?

17:45.762 --> 17:47.846
I'm not saying your work isn't legitimate.

17:47.898 --> 17:49.480
What are you saying?

17:49.516 --> 17:52.700
Well, first of all, I'd like
to see you make actual music.

17:52.736 --> 17:54.769
You know, something that
uses more of your talent.

17:54.771 --> 17:57.438
So you do judge my work.

17:57.440 --> 17:59.657
Toby, you can barely pay your rent.

17:59.693 --> 18:02.610
You work four hours a week
making people dance at a party.

18:02.612 --> 18:05.496
I prepare all week for those four hours.

18:05.532 --> 18:07.832
I just don't think it sounds
like a career with a future.

18:07.868 --> 18:10.752
See, this is exactly why I didn't
want to take that check from you.

18:10.787 --> 18:12.453
This has nothing to do with that check.

18:12.505 --> 18:13.872
This has everything to do with it.

18:13.924 --> 18:15.790
Well, I'm not pleased

18:15.842 --> 18:16.925
that I gave you money for rent

18:16.960 --> 18:18.927
and you're off trying to buy a turntable.

18:18.962 --> 18:20.628
I do have a problem with that.

18:20.630 --> 18:22.463
I told you, it's an investment.

18:22.515 --> 18:23.631
And by the way, I'm 20 years old...

18:23.633 --> 18:24.899
I don't need to think about my future.

18:24.935 --> 18:27.518
When I was your age, I was
already student teaching.

18:27.554 --> 18:28.803
Well, good for you.

18:28.805 --> 18:31.689
So, how are the steaks coming along?

18:31.725 --> 18:32.724
Smells great, you two.

18:32.776 --> 18:34.809
Looking good.

18:34.861 --> 18:36.527
Potential for amazing I'd say.

18:48.575 --> 18:49.574
Hey.

18:50.627 --> 18:51.826
Hi.

18:51.828 --> 18:53.878
I'm sorry to just drop
in. I should have called.

18:53.914 --> 18:55.630
Oh, no, no, no. It's great.

18:57.701 --> 18:59.434
This place is really cool.

18:59.469 --> 19:00.635
It will be.

19:00.670 --> 19:02.470
Whoa, look at that.

19:03.640 --> 19:05.707
Regina: I'm just figuring it out.

19:05.742 --> 19:07.842
No, it's amazing.

19:07.844 --> 19:09.510
(Sighs)

19:09.512 --> 19:10.762
Do you think I could help?

19:10.814 --> 19:14.565
Yes! I should have invited
you in the first place, come!

19:18.605 --> 19:20.688
Okay, so just continue the pattern.

19:20.690 --> 19:22.573
Orange, yellow, orange. Like that.

19:22.609 --> 19:23.691
Okay, thanks.

19:24.861 --> 19:27.662
So, how's community service?

19:27.697 --> 19:28.830
Any more trouble with that girl?

19:28.865 --> 19:30.448
Tess?

19:30.500 --> 19:32.533
No. We sort of...

19:32.585 --> 19:33.868
- Worked things out.
- Good.

19:40.877 --> 19:42.543
Actually...

19:43.713 --> 19:44.679
Tess does have...

19:45.849 --> 19:48.850
Well, she did talk to me
about something that happened,

19:48.885 --> 19:51.719
and she doesn't really have a mom
or a mother figure in her life.

19:52.973 --> 19:56.941
So, I was wondering what you
might say about her dilemma.

19:57.978 --> 19:59.644
- Shoot.
- Okay.

19:59.696 --> 20:00.728
Um, well..

20:02.565 --> 20:03.815
(Sighs)

20:03.867 --> 20:04.899
Tess has a boyfriend.

20:04.901 --> 20:08.536
A pretty serious one. I
think she loves him a lot.

20:08.571 --> 20:10.571
But I guess last night she got...

20:11.741 --> 20:12.790
really drunk,

20:12.826 --> 20:14.659
like, smashed.

20:14.711 --> 20:16.494
And when she woke up this morning,

20:16.546 --> 20:19.714
she found out that she had had sex

20:19.749 --> 20:23.801
with someone else, but
she doesn't remember it.

20:23.837 --> 20:25.586
Nothing. Blackout.

20:26.923 --> 20:28.923
Does that count as cheating?

20:28.975 --> 20:30.725
I mean...

20:30.760 --> 20:31.809
does she have to tell her boyfriend?

20:31.845 --> 20:33.644
Well, that's awful.

20:34.814 --> 20:35.763
That she cheated.

20:35.815 --> 20:37.815
That she was raped.

20:39.936 --> 20:40.935
What?

20:42.655 --> 20:45.656
Well, if she was so drunk that she
couldn't remember it the next day,

20:45.692 --> 20:46.858
then she didn't give consent.

20:48.912 --> 20:50.611
Right.

20:50.613 --> 20:52.530
Well, in my opinion,

20:52.582 --> 20:53.781
in a lot of people's opinion.

20:55.585 --> 20:57.452
But she wasn't passed out.

20:57.504 --> 20:59.620
And what if she did give consent,

20:59.672 --> 21:00.788
but she just doesn't remember it?

21:02.592 --> 21:04.625
If she said yes,

21:04.627 --> 21:07.628
but she said it when she was that wasted,

21:07.664 --> 21:09.764
the guy should not have
had sex with her, period.

21:17.640 --> 21:19.474
I don't know that I agree with you...

21:20.894 --> 21:22.810
but thank you.

21:22.862 --> 21:23.811
I'll tell her.

21:38.200 --> 21:40.250
- Great job once again, grill master.
- Yep.

21:41.453 --> 21:43.370
So, Tob, um...

21:43.422 --> 21:48.124
Your mom and I were talking, and we
would like to give you a little something

21:48.126 --> 21:49.426
to see you through the end of the month.

21:49.461 --> 21:51.294
You guys just cut me off.

21:51.296 --> 21:53.013
Yes.

21:53.048 --> 21:54.130
But...

21:54.132 --> 21:56.132
Think of it as an advance on the musical.

21:57.135 --> 21:59.269
We barely started. You
don't have to do that.

22:00.973 --> 22:04.975
We just don't want to put you
in an awkward position with Lily.

22:06.378 --> 22:08.979
You know what? I think I've had
all the humiliation I can take

22:09.014 --> 22:11.197
for one day. So if you don't
mind, I'm gonna pack it in.

22:11.233 --> 22:13.066
Okay.

22:13.118 --> 22:15.151
Would you like to take some dessert home?

22:15.153 --> 22:16.236
No.

22:21.076 --> 22:22.158
I'll take a little cobbler.

22:25.998 --> 22:27.047
(Sighs)

22:27.099 --> 22:28.164
(Door closes)

22:28.200 --> 22:30.133
He is gonna blow it with that girl.

22:39.311 --> 22:41.344
You have to keep it moving.
Do you want me to stir?

22:41.396 --> 22:43.013
I'm okay.

22:44.266 --> 22:46.983
I've done this before. You
add it in small amounts.

22:47.019 --> 22:48.184
Girl: Guys, stop it.

22:48.186 --> 22:50.153
Girl: This isn't even our house.

22:50.188 --> 22:51.404
(Gasping)

22:51.440 --> 22:53.106
Could you back off?

22:53.158 --> 22:54.407
I was just trying to help.

22:54.443 --> 22:56.910
Now there's not going to be
enough for the rest of us.

22:56.945 --> 22:57.994
Don't touch it!

22:59.998 --> 23:01.948
Just give me some room, please.

23:03.001 --> 23:04.134
Girl: Fine.

23:14.735 --> 23:19.865
_

23:24.506 --> 23:26.669
_

23:27.392 --> 23:28.358
No, I'm okay.

23:29.394 --> 23:33.029
So, pretty crazy party, right?

23:33.030 --> 23:37.500
_

23:37.501 --> 23:44.270
_

23:44.275 --> 23:46.159
(Laughs nervously) That's funny.

23:46.211 --> 23:47.410
Um, so...

23:47.462 --> 23:50.163
how did I...

23:50.215 --> 23:51.851
end up in a room?

23:51.852 --> 23:57.518
_

23:58.290 --> 24:00.306

24:08.984 --> 24:10.100
Oh, are you okay?

24:10.102 --> 24:11.267
Come on.

24:11.319 --> 24:13.103
I don't feel so good.

24:17.409 --> 24:19.075
The room's spinning.

24:19.111 --> 24:21.111
Whoa, whoa!

24:23.112 --> 24:30.720
_

24:30.721 --> 24:32.962
_

24:37.012 --> 24:38.261
Who was I with?

24:39.462 --> 24:44.660
_

24:44.661 --> 24:47.436
_

24:49.307 --> 24:50.390
Yeah.

24:53.491 --> 24:54.832
_

24:55.313 --> 24:56.980
Totally.

24:56.982 --> 24:59.899
I just wanted to fill
in some of the blanks.

24:59.951 --> 25:00.950
Thanks.

25:04.356 --> 25:07.323
Fine, you're right. I shouldn't
have bought the turntable.

25:09.060 --> 25:10.994
It's none of my business. I
shouldn't have said anything.

25:11.997 --> 25:14.998
My mom offered to give me
an advance on the musical,

25:15.000 --> 25:18.334
so, I'm gonna pay you back, and we'll
act like none of this ever happened.

25:20.005 --> 25:21.004
Sure.

25:21.056 --> 25:22.972
That sounded convincing.

25:23.008 --> 25:24.057
What do you want me to say?

25:24.092 --> 25:25.108
I don't know.

25:25.143 --> 25:27.010
That you understand who I am.

25:27.012 --> 25:30.013
That you're not going to be
waiting around for me to...

25:30.065 --> 25:31.931
become some straitlaced guy in a suit,

25:31.983 --> 25:33.099
'cause that's never gonna happen.

25:33.151 --> 25:34.400
I don't want you to be someone you're not.

25:34.436 --> 25:36.936
So, what?

25:36.988 --> 25:39.189
Maybe we're just two very different people.

25:41.059 --> 25:42.959
Let me get this straight:

25:42.994 --> 25:44.294
I didn't want you to give me the money,

25:44.329 --> 25:46.362
you gave me the money, and
now you're breaking up with me?

25:46.414 --> 25:49.032
Can we just talk about this tomorrow?

25:50.418 --> 25:52.001
Okay.

26:00.345 --> 26:02.378
That's too frozen. We can't eat it.

26:02.414 --> 26:04.264
Maybe if you weren't hanging over me.

26:04.299 --> 26:06.216
Maybe if you didn't hog all the materials.

26:06.251 --> 26:08.318
This is not the time to
fix your grade, all right?

26:09.387 --> 26:10.970
Excuse me?

26:11.022 --> 26:12.939
Everyone knows that you
got a D on the midterm.

26:15.227 --> 26:16.259
Why are you still in this class?

26:17.979 --> 26:19.028
Oh, wait.

26:19.064 --> 26:20.396
What is that supposed to mean?

26:20.398 --> 26:22.031
Never mind.

26:22.067 --> 26:23.116
No. What?

26:23.151 --> 26:25.335
It's just obvious things
are a little easier for you.

26:25.370 --> 26:27.237
Easier for me?

26:27.272 --> 26:28.288
You think I have it easy?

26:28.323 --> 26:30.240
I think you're not the
only one that has it hard,

26:30.242 --> 26:33.209
but you don't see us getting
special breaks and second chances.

26:33.245 --> 26:37.247
You think that getting advanced
notes because I can't hear the lecture

26:37.299 --> 26:39.015
is some kind of special break?

26:41.119 --> 26:42.318
Professor Marillo: Okay!

26:42.354 --> 26:44.304
I think that should do it.

26:44.339 --> 26:46.089
Time's up.

26:50.897 --> 26:53.813
I don't remember what happened between us.

26:55.601 --> 26:56.767
I don't remember...

26:58.737 --> 26:59.770
You know.

26:59.805 --> 27:02.406
(Scoffs) Damn.

27:02.441 --> 27:04.441
I mean, we were both pretty drunk.

27:04.493 --> 27:06.410
I know I was not loving
life this morning myself.

27:07.496 --> 27:09.663
And if I don't remember...

27:11.450 --> 27:13.417
How do I know that I wanted it to happen?

27:14.837 --> 27:15.819
What are you saying?

27:17.790 --> 27:20.590
Well, some people say that

27:20.626 --> 27:22.426
if you're too drunk to remember,

27:22.461 --> 27:23.794
then that's not...

27:23.829 --> 27:25.679
it's not...

27:25.714 --> 27:27.431
it's just not okay.

27:28.934 --> 27:30.634
Uh...

27:30.636 --> 27:32.469
Are you accusing me of...

27:32.471 --> 27:33.804
I'm just saying, if I was that drunk,

27:33.856 --> 27:34.888
maybe you shouldn't have...

27:34.940 --> 27:36.807
What? Like, taken advantage of you?

27:36.809 --> 27:38.809
We were having a great time.

27:38.811 --> 27:41.695
I was on the verge of throwing up!

27:41.730 --> 27:42.863
I was practically passed out.

27:42.898 --> 27:44.531
You were not passed out.

27:44.566 --> 27:46.616
- What do you take me for?
- Well, I couldn't have been into it.

27:46.652 --> 27:48.485
Why? Because you regret it today?

27:48.487 --> 27:50.454
- Hey!
- People have drunk sex all the time.

27:50.489 --> 27:51.721
It doesn't mean someone got attacked.

27:51.757 --> 27:53.824
I'm not talking about anyone else.

27:53.826 --> 27:55.492
I'm talking about us.

27:55.544 --> 27:56.543
What happened with us.

27:56.578 --> 27:58.412
You told me you still had feelings for me.

27:58.464 --> 27:59.663
You told me you and
Emmett were gonna break up.

27:59.715 --> 28:01.581
- I did not.
- You kissed me.

28:01.633 --> 28:02.666
What?

28:02.668 --> 28:03.834
You don't remember that either?

28:03.869 --> 28:05.836
(Rock music playing)

28:10.476 --> 28:12.676
- Oh, he's back.
- (Laughs)

28:12.728 --> 28:14.761
And I come bearing hydration.

28:14.813 --> 28:17.514
Wait, you gotta see this. Come here.

28:18.734 --> 28:20.400
(Groans)

28:21.687 --> 28:23.653
(Sighs)

28:23.689 --> 28:25.489
Whoa.

28:25.524 --> 28:26.656
Tank: Cool.

28:26.692 --> 28:28.859
(Both laughing)

28:30.562 --> 28:32.462
You're so awesome. You know that?

28:32.498 --> 28:34.731
Oh, why, thank you.

28:34.766 --> 28:36.666
I think you're pretty awesome, too.

28:36.702 --> 28:39.603
I should have given you more of a chance.

28:39.638 --> 28:41.788
Yeah, well, I wholeheartedly agree.

28:45.511 --> 28:47.677
I don't know what's gonna
happen with me and Emmett.

28:48.747 --> 28:49.713
Really?

28:50.849 --> 28:54.584
He's so far, and I'm so far.

28:55.687 --> 28:57.387
We're both so far.

28:58.724 --> 29:01.391
I never got over you. You know that?

29:02.794 --> 29:05.445
Oh, Tank.

29:06.698 --> 29:08.532
You're so beautiful.

29:08.567 --> 29:10.450
(Giggling) Thanks.

29:15.574 --> 29:17.407
Oh, wow.

29:17.409 --> 29:18.825
(Laughs)

29:18.877 --> 29:21.711
I'm really drunk.

29:21.747 --> 29:23.630
(Laughing)

29:23.665 --> 29:24.664
Me, too.

29:24.716 --> 29:26.416
(Both laughing)

29:26.468 --> 29:28.468
(Rock music playing)

29:30.556 --> 29:32.506
I said we were having problems.

29:32.558 --> 29:34.591
I did not say I wanted to
get back together with you.

29:34.593 --> 29:36.560
You were touching me.

29:36.595 --> 29:37.761
I was falling asleep.

29:37.813 --> 29:39.646
I wasn't undressing you,

29:39.681 --> 29:42.516
and I definitely didn't kiss you.

29:42.568 --> 29:43.600
You kissed me,

29:43.602 --> 29:44.768
and I stopped you.

29:44.770 --> 29:46.770
That is totally untrue.

29:46.822 --> 29:48.822
(Rock music playing)

29:53.529 --> 29:55.612
He's back.

29:55.614 --> 29:57.614
I come bearing hydration.

29:58.784 --> 29:59.866
Oh, wait.

29:59.918 --> 30:01.501
You gotta see this. Come here.

30:01.537 --> 30:02.586
Hmm?

30:02.621 --> 30:03.920
Whoa.

30:03.956 --> 30:05.505
Oh.

30:06.658 --> 30:07.707
Wow.

30:09.761 --> 30:10.794
Tank: It's cool.

30:13.732 --> 30:15.498
- Hey.
- Hmm?

30:15.534 --> 30:17.734
Thanks for being my friend tonight.

30:20.806 --> 30:23.573
How come it didn't work out with us again?

30:25.877 --> 30:29.512
I don't know what's gonna
happen with me and Emmett.

30:30.749 --> 30:31.815
Really?

30:32.818 --> 30:34.901
He's so far,

30:34.953 --> 30:37.921
and I'm so far. We're both just so far.

30:38.991 --> 30:40.907
Huh.

30:40.959 --> 30:42.742
I never got over you.

30:44.880 --> 30:45.912
(Chuckles)

30:47.583 --> 30:48.832
You know that?

30:49.968 --> 30:51.668
Tank...

30:51.720 --> 30:53.553
You're so beautiful.

30:54.556 --> 30:55.589
Thanks.

30:59.645 --> 31:01.845
I'm really drunk.

31:03.515 --> 31:04.598
Me, too.

31:04.650 --> 31:06.516
(Laughing)

31:08.604 --> 31:10.770
(Rock music playing)

31:13.575 --> 31:15.692
You did not push me away. You were into it.

31:15.694 --> 31:16.826
How do you know?

31:16.862 --> 31:18.361
Because I didn't black out.

31:18.363 --> 31:21.698
And I'm just supposed to just believe
that it happened the way you said it did?

31:21.750 --> 31:23.533
Bay...

31:23.585 --> 31:26.536
If you had said, "no" at any
point, I would have stopped.

31:26.538 --> 31:27.871
Did I say, "yes"?

31:27.923 --> 31:30.840
(Scoffs) That's ridiculous.

31:30.876 --> 31:33.627
What was I supposed to do? Stop
at every single point and ask,

31:33.679 --> 31:34.911
"Do you want this? Do you want that?"

31:34.946 --> 31:36.713
No, no one does that.

31:36.715 --> 31:38.715
One thing leads to
another. You're being crazy.

31:38.717 --> 31:40.850
Do not call me crazy.

31:40.886 --> 31:42.636
You seemed into it.

31:42.688 --> 31:44.521
But if I don't remember it,

31:44.556 --> 31:45.555
how can that be okay?

31:46.608 --> 31:47.807
You woke up today all freaked out

31:47.859 --> 31:49.643
because you cheated on your boyfriend,

31:49.695 --> 31:52.562
but do not turn around and try to make
what happened something that it wasn't.

31:52.564 --> 31:54.731
We had sex, Bay.

31:54.766 --> 31:55.782
It was not assault.

31:57.486 --> 31:58.535
(Sighs)

32:05.460 --> 32:06.576
What the hell was that?

32:08.477 --> 32:11.362
Professor Marillo: This was an experiment.

32:11.703 --> 32:13.703
And like all experiments,

32:13.755 --> 32:15.204
it began with a hypothesis.

32:15.240 --> 32:19.709
What was the hypothesis? And don't
anyone say a word about ice cream.

32:23.882 --> 32:25.715
The hypothesis

32:25.750 --> 32:28.635
was that a room full of young scientists

32:28.687 --> 32:32.605
could come together to solve a problem.

32:32.641 --> 32:34.941
I never told you

32:34.976 --> 32:37.694
that you had to work alone,

32:37.729 --> 32:41.564
but that's what each of you chose to do.

32:41.616 --> 32:44.617
You saw everyone else
in this room as a threat.

32:44.653 --> 32:48.788
You squabbled, you refused
to share innovation,

32:48.823 --> 32:49.956
you turned on each other.

32:49.991 --> 32:52.041
You failed.

32:53.611 --> 32:55.712
You're here tonight, because...

32:55.747 --> 32:57.580
you're members of a...

32:57.632 --> 32:59.916
pathetically small group in this country.

32:59.985 --> 33:01.718
You are S.T.E.M. women.

33:01.753 --> 33:02.919
What do I mean by S.T.E.M.?

33:03.989 --> 33:06.756
Science, technology, engineering, and...

33:06.791 --> 33:08.725
Mathematics.

33:08.760 --> 33:10.643
Professor Marillo: Thank you.

33:10.679 --> 33:12.862
Now, if you want S.T.E.M.

33:12.897 --> 33:15.565
To continue to be dominated by men,

33:15.600 --> 33:17.650
as it has since Pythagoras,

33:17.686 --> 33:21.738
then by all means, you continue
to do what you did tonight.

33:22.974 --> 33:23.940
But...

33:25.243 --> 33:29.045
If you'd like to see more than
five girls in this room next year,

33:30.615 --> 33:32.682
then you change the conditions.

33:33.868 --> 33:36.919
Be each other's allies.

33:40.892 --> 33:42.625
Fortunately,

33:42.627 --> 33:44.027
I bought some backup ice cream.

33:44.062 --> 33:46.963
Come into the kitchen. We'll partake.

33:55.857 --> 33:57.740
Eric: I'm not going to let you quit.

33:57.776 --> 33:59.892
Because here's the thing, pal,

33:59.944 --> 34:02.812
practicing something every
day, whether you want to or not,

34:02.814 --> 34:04.614
is how you get good at anything.

34:04.649 --> 34:06.899
You gotta hit the slopes every day.

34:06.951 --> 34:09.652
And those days that you don't want
to do it, but you do it anyway?

34:09.704 --> 34:12.572
Those are the days that count the most.

34:12.623 --> 34:13.906
Now go!

34:13.958 --> 34:15.958
Rock that lesson.

34:15.994 --> 34:17.577
I'll see you tonight.

34:19.047 --> 34:20.580
Sorry.

34:20.632 --> 34:22.632
Kid hounded me to start trumpet lessons.

34:22.667 --> 34:23.833
And then it got hard.

34:23.885 --> 34:24.917
Yeah.

34:24.969 --> 34:26.735
I really like what you had to say.

34:27.772 --> 34:28.771
You're a good dad.

34:28.806 --> 34:31.641
- Pebbles down the abyss.
- Oh.

34:33.762 --> 34:34.761
So, what's this?

34:35.813 --> 34:37.847
I collected a bunch of vintage post cards,

34:37.849 --> 34:40.817
and I thought maybe we could
shellac them into the tables.

34:41.853 --> 34:42.885
That's cool.

34:42.920 --> 34:44.737
Some of them are pretty amazing.

34:44.773 --> 34:45.987
Like this one.

34:46.024 --> 34:48.690
Miami, 1956.

34:51.079 --> 34:52.862
<i>♪ We got ourselves a problem ♪</i>

34:52.897 --> 34:54.664
"Thinking of you every day.

34:55.699 --> 34:58.534
Longing for you every night."

34:58.586 --> 35:00.703
<i>♪ Better than I solve 'em ♪</i>

35:00.755 --> 35:01.871
Nelson had it bad.

35:01.923 --> 35:03.606
(Laughing)

35:03.641 --> 35:06.759
<i>♪ I believed I found
a way around this ♪</i>

35:06.795 --> 35:08.611
And you think this...

35:08.646 --> 35:10.713
Shellac will hold?

35:11.816 --> 35:13.716
We could use marine varnish.

35:14.853 --> 35:16.552
That'll stand up to anything.

35:17.589 --> 35:20.723
<i>♪ There's too much smoke to see it ♪</i>

35:20.725 --> 35:24.560
<i>♪ there's too much broke to feel this ♪</i>

35:24.612 --> 35:27.947
<i>♪ well, I love you, I love you ♪</i>

35:27.982 --> 35:30.983
<i>♪ and all of your pieces ♪</i>

35:31.035 --> 35:33.653
Hmm. Okay.

35:34.706 --> 35:35.905
I'm... I'm sorry.

35:35.957 --> 35:37.740
Don't be sorry.

35:37.792 --> 35:39.992
I know I'm giving mixed signals.

35:42.914 --> 35:44.747
I want to make sure you're okay with this.

35:45.950 --> 35:47.583
I am.

35:49.671 --> 35:51.888
Because, well, if you regret it later...

35:53.007 --> 35:55.591
I am not going to regret it.

35:58.646 --> 36:01.731
<i>♪ There's too much smoke to see it ♪</i>

36:01.766 --> 36:03.766
We got about an hour before
he's back from trumpet.

36:04.936 --> 36:06.652
Wanna go upstairs?

36:06.688 --> 36:09.522
Oh, I merit going upstairs now?

36:09.574 --> 36:11.607
I didn't want to lose momentum last time.

36:11.609 --> 36:13.576
But you're feeling a little more confident?

36:13.611 --> 36:14.944
Mm, you want to go upstairs or not?

36:14.996 --> 36:16.696
(Laughing)

36:16.748 --> 36:17.997
I do.

36:25.757 --> 36:27.790
- It wasn't like that.
- Then why is she saying it?

36:27.842 --> 36:31.677
She has a boyfriend, and she wants to
rewrite history so she doesn't feel bad.

36:31.713 --> 36:32.962
Bay wouldn't do that.

36:32.997 --> 36:34.881
Obviously something happened
that she's not cool with.

36:34.933 --> 36:37.033
What? Do you think I forced myself on her?

36:37.068 --> 36:38.851
I don't know what's going on.

36:38.887 --> 36:41.804
All I know is that my sister just
ran out of here looking really upset.

36:41.806 --> 36:44.891
Well, talk to the 20 other people at
that party who saw her flirting with me.

36:44.943 --> 36:46.859
I don't want to talk to
them. I'm talking to you.

36:46.895 --> 36:50.646
And I'm telling you what happened
between us last night was consensual.

36:52.784 --> 36:54.700
- You don't believe me?
- I don't know.

36:56.788 --> 36:57.787
You don't believe me.

36:59.791 --> 37:01.624
Toby...

37:01.659 --> 37:02.625
It's me.

37:03.995 --> 37:05.745
She's my sister.

37:07.916 --> 37:09.832
I see whose side you're gonna be on.

37:09.884 --> 37:10.967
Look, there's no sides.

37:11.002 --> 37:12.668
I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.

37:13.755 --> 37:15.671
I can't believe she's doing this.

37:15.673 --> 37:17.640
I cannot believe this is happening.

37:17.675 --> 37:18.925
It's like I'm in a nightmare!

37:20.562 --> 37:21.577
(Door slams)

37:23.795 --> 37:27.180
So, I guess if we managed to
fight our way into science,

37:27.182 --> 37:30.433
we, too, could someday have a
welcome mat of the periodic table.

37:31.570 --> 37:34.270
<i>I was just relieved there
wasn't anything Star Trek.</i>

37:35.323 --> 37:37.440
R2-D2 soap dispenser in the bathroom.

37:37.442 --> 37:39.275
(Laughing)

37:39.327 --> 37:40.410
Seriously?

37:41.446 --> 37:43.363
She's pretty cool, though.

37:43.415 --> 37:47.167
Yeah, at first I thought she was
just a hard-ass for the fun of it.

37:49.588 --> 37:51.504
My mom wanted to be a physicist,

37:51.540 --> 37:54.157
but her dad shut it down.

37:54.192 --> 37:56.342
Probably why she pushed me so hard.

37:56.378 --> 37:58.461
- Wow.
- Yeah.

37:58.463 --> 38:00.430
Total tiger mom.

38:00.465 --> 38:02.182
You don't want to know.

38:02.217 --> 38:03.349
My mom pushed me, too.

38:03.385 --> 38:05.351
The deaf thing? Never let it hold you back.

38:07.189 --> 38:08.471
I shouldn't have said
what I said back there.

38:09.524 --> 38:11.140
That was really crappy.

38:12.310 --> 38:15.777
I know it looks like I get
a lot of extra help, but...

38:15.780 --> 38:19.148
Can we just pretend it never happened?

38:20.285 --> 38:21.551
- Sure.
- Thank you.

38:24.155 --> 38:26.489
So, is it okay if I work
with Josh tomorrow night?

38:26.541 --> 38:29.125
You don't have to ask my permission.

38:30.161 --> 38:32.245
I thought maybe you two had plans.

38:32.297 --> 38:34.414
I just need him three nights
a week, if that's okay.

38:34.466 --> 38:37.250
I'm sure we can work out
a custody arrangement.

38:38.420 --> 38:40.303
(Laughing)

38:40.338 --> 38:41.304
Well, I'd better go.

38:42.340 --> 38:44.307
- See you in class?
- I'll be there.

38:51.433 --> 38:52.565
(Knocking)

38:52.601 --> 38:54.317
Toby: Thanks for coming down.

38:54.352 --> 38:56.352
I thought we agreed to talk tomorrow.

38:56.404 --> 38:58.221
It's not about that.

38:58.256 --> 38:59.422
Tonight was dumb.

38:59.457 --> 39:00.523
We're totally right for each other.

39:00.525 --> 39:02.125
I don't want us to break up.

39:02.160 --> 39:03.493
I was thinking the same thing.

39:03.528 --> 39:05.094
Good.

39:08.283 --> 39:11.200
Something happened to Bay, and, um...

39:11.253 --> 39:13.202
I need to figure out
what to do. Can we talk?

39:13.204 --> 39:15.204
Of course. What is it?

39:23.181 --> 39:24.213
Hey!

39:25.517 --> 39:26.549
Hey.

39:28.436 --> 39:29.452
You okay?

39:30.555 --> 39:32.472
Yeah, totally.

39:37.445 --> 39:39.279
Bay, what's going on?

39:45.570 --> 39:47.153
I was drunk.

39:48.239 --> 39:49.572
So what?

39:49.574 --> 39:52.125
Really drunk. We both were.

39:54.412 --> 39:58.381
Okay, but that doesn't mean
that he can do whatever he wants.

39:59.417 --> 40:01.584
But neither of us were thinking straight.

40:05.173 --> 40:06.306
Daphne, what if...

40:08.259 --> 40:11.260
I said, "yes," but I don't remember it?

40:14.265 --> 40:15.348
Could you have?

40:17.435 --> 40:18.434
I don't know.

40:20.438 --> 40:22.488
I don't know what happened exactly.

40:25.493 --> 40:27.443
All I know...

40:27.445 --> 40:30.330
is that when I woke up, I felt...

40:30.365 --> 40:31.614
like something was wrong.

40:38.206 --> 40:40.206
But is that crazy,

40:40.258 --> 40:41.357
going on intuition?

40:43.695 --> 40:45.211
No.

40:46.297 --> 40:47.630
You have to trust yourself.

40:49.384 --> 40:50.350
I guess.

40:51.386 --> 40:52.468
Yeah.

40:59.527 --> 41:01.344
So, what do you want to do?

41:02.480 --> 41:05.198
Just tell me what you want
to do, and we'll do it.

41:05.233 --> 41:07.316
I don't want to do anything.

41:08.486 --> 41:10.570
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

41:12.157 --> 41:13.623
I just want to forget about it.

41:15.326 --> 41:16.459
Are you sure?

41:19.330 --> 41:20.596
Then that's what we'll do.

41:22.634 --> 41:25.168
(Sighs) Okay, that's what we'll do.

41:26.504 --> 41:27.553
It's over.
