WEBVTT

00:17.642 --> 00:19.935
ANNOUNCER: Escape from
a Separatist prison!

00:19.978 --> 00:21.729
Carrying information about secret routes

00:21.813 --> 00:24.732
into the heart of the Republic
and Separatist home worlds,

00:24.816 --> 00:26.775
Jedi Master Even Piell was captured,

00:26.860 --> 00:29.737
and imprisoned in a fortress
known as the Citadel.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.488
Leading an elite strike team,

00:31.573 --> 00:36.035
Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker
rescued Master Piell and his officers.

00:36.494 --> 00:39.538
Now the Jedi have split up
to evade Separatist forces

00:39.622 --> 00:42.041
as they attempt to escape the Citadel...

00:50.467 --> 00:53.052
Artoo, are you and your battle droids
ready to go?

00:53.136 --> 00:54.678
(R2-D2 BEEPING)

00:56.139 --> 00:57.681
All right, get the ship fired up,

00:57.766 --> 01:00.642
we'll meet you at the pipeline exit
after you've picked Obi-Wan,

01:00.727 --> 01:02.519
assuming he's still on schedule.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.313
(R2-D2 BEEPING EXCITEDLY)

01:15.658 --> 01:17.367
(R2-D2 CHIRPING)

01:40.350 --> 01:42.643
OBI-WAN: This passage will
get us near the landing pad.

02:03.373 --> 02:05.874
Artoo, send the shuttle to
the rear landing platform.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.084
(R2-D2 BEEPING)

02:07.168 --> 02:10.671
We've already been given the go-ahead
by General Skywalker, sir.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.382
Assuming you are still on schedule.

02:13.716 --> 02:16.468
The trick will be if Anakin arrives on time.

02:19.722 --> 02:20.764
A probe!

02:26.354 --> 02:27.729
(WHOOSHING)

02:29.440 --> 02:30.524
Did you get it?

02:34.904 --> 02:37.406
Security doors!
Move or you'll be cut in half!

02:41.369 --> 02:42.661
I can't!

02:42.745 --> 02:44.037
(GROANS)

02:50.628 --> 02:54.548
We lost one.
Looks like we've got some cutting to do.

02:58.928 --> 03:02.681
Count Dooku insists that you
speak with him, Commander.

03:02.765 --> 03:05.225
Well, let's not keep him waiting.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.436
He's already waiting, sir.

03:12.233 --> 03:16.361
Count Dooku, my lord. How unexpected.

03:16.738 --> 03:19.615
You may cease the propriety,
Commander Sobeck.

03:19.699 --> 03:23.035
I understand there is a problem
with the Jedi prisoner.

03:23.411 --> 03:28.874
An incursion team attempted a rescue,
but the situation is taken care of.

03:28.958 --> 03:32.961
Are you in possession of the information
the prisoner is carrying?

03:33.046 --> 03:36.798
Not yet. But we will soon have it.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.967
You are aware that this information will

03:39.052 --> 03:42.554
tip the scale of the war to
the side that controls it.

03:42.972 --> 03:47.142
Perhaps, this is a matter that
requires my presence?

03:47.393 --> 03:49.394
No, my lord.

03:49.646 --> 03:54.149
Find them, Commander.
Get the information,

03:54.484 --> 03:57.110
then kill them all.

03:59.322 --> 04:04.076
Don't ever surprise me with
a transmission from Count Dooku!

04:04.160 --> 04:06.119
I need time to prepare!

04:06.454 --> 04:08.163
Yes, Commander.

04:23.846 --> 04:25.389
(BEEPING)

04:27.725 --> 04:29.268
(LIGHTSABER WHOOSHING)

04:35.358 --> 04:38.694
I am beginning to admire
the design of this fortress.

04:38.736 --> 04:40.862
It's rather formidable to evade.

04:40.905 --> 04:44.074
How can you admire such a horrible place?

04:44.200 --> 04:46.410
Ah, you reveal your short-sightedness.

04:46.536 --> 04:50.872
This ordeal only demonstrates
how effective facilities like the Citadel are.

04:50.999 --> 04:55.168
Pity it ended up in Separatist hands
and not ours.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.505
He has a point.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.010
All right, Snips,
I need you to lead the group.

05:03.052 --> 05:05.387
Keep following the tunnel. I'll catch up.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.180
Hey, where are you going?

05:07.348 --> 05:10.559
Obi-Wan's not here,
so someone has to protect our flank.

05:11.728 --> 05:14.771
I guess it's a good thing I came along
after all.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.697
We've received a coded transmission.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.575
Apparently they've split up
into two groups.

05:26.743 --> 05:30.120
The rendezvous points are
the landing field behind the tower

05:30.246 --> 05:33.248
where Artoo will pick up Obi-Wan Kenobi,

05:33.374 --> 05:37.461
and the pipeline exit
where they'll find Anakin Skywalker.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.464
And what if things
don't go according to plan?

05:40.631 --> 05:45.093
Then we would have to send an entire fleet
to get them out of there.

05:47.930 --> 05:53.143
I am concerned that the Jedi have
elected this child to lead the group.

05:53.561 --> 05:56.855
I've served with her many times
and I trust her, Captain.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.233
Uh-oh.

06:01.986 --> 06:03.195
REX: Dead end.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.535
It looks like
there are security guards there.

06:10.620 --> 06:11.661
(R2-D2 BEEPING)

06:11.746 --> 06:15.040
Okay, boss, we'll land and wait
for General Kenobi.

06:32.975 --> 06:36.520
Uh-oh. That doesn't look like
General Kenobi.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.772
We'll have to improvise.

06:39.941 --> 06:44.444
Your arrival is long overdue,
where have you been?

06:44.529 --> 06:46.071
(R2-D2 BEEPING)

06:46.447 --> 06:51.993
Even so, the odds are 3-to-1
that you are a traitor.

06:52.078 --> 06:55.080
We will take you to interrogation below.

06:55.456 --> 06:58.041
Yes, sir. Move it!

06:58.126 --> 06:59.668
(R2-D2 BEEPING)

07:03.172 --> 07:06.591
Don't talk back to me, droid. I'm in charge.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.387
We have captured the shuttle

07:10.513 --> 07:12.848
that infiltrated our defenses.

07:13.683 --> 07:18.520
Good, guard the shuttle
and we'll lure the Jedi into a trap.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.613
(R2-D2 BEEPING)

07:31.534 --> 07:35.370
Sorry, Commander. Just wanted to
fool them. What are your orders?

07:35.538 --> 07:37.622
(BEEPING EXCITEDLY)

07:37.915 --> 07:40.542
You're right! If we're not at the shuttle,

07:40.626 --> 07:43.378
General Kenobi could be
walking into a trap!

07:43.421 --> 07:45.797
We'll try to locate them
if they get captured.

07:53.389 --> 07:54.681
-(FIRING)
-Look out!

07:57.935 --> 07:59.853
(LIGHTSABER WHOOSHING)

08:07.862 --> 08:09.738
What happened?
Why didn't you blow the wall?

08:10.198 --> 08:12.073
That part of the plan was your job!

08:17.413 --> 08:19.623
I thought it was a dead end.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.417
If Master Plo really assigned you
to this mission,

08:22.460 --> 08:23.919
he would have briefed you on the plan.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.012
(BEEPING)

08:55.576 --> 08:58.620
CODY: The shuttle's there
but there's no sign of Artoo.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.248
Something might have happened.

09:01.290 --> 09:02.457
We'll have to make our way around to

09:02.583 --> 09:04.876
the other side and get a different view.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.628
This could be a trap.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.144
-(COMLINK BEEPS)
-Anakin?

10:04.228 --> 10:07.522
I must commend you on
your escape tactics,

10:07.857 --> 10:10.317
but in the end it was easy to

10:10.401 --> 10:12.110
predict your every move.

10:12.194 --> 10:13.445
(WHIRRING)

10:22.705 --> 10:24.456
(LAUGHING)

10:38.262 --> 10:40.680
This pipe leads up to the top of the ridge,

10:40.765 --> 10:42.849
where Artoo will pick us up
and get us out of here.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.644
There's the hatch.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.986
Let's go! Let's go! Everyone in.
Don't use your lights,

10:55.071 --> 10:56.821
and make sure your weapons are locked.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.658
The slightest electronic pulse could
ignite this whole tube.

10:59.950 --> 11:02.744
I hope somebody tells the droids that.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.101
Welcome back.

11:29.355 --> 11:34.109
I must say, you're not at all what I pictured
for someone who has such a soft voice.

11:35.903 --> 11:39.114
(GROWLS) I want your half
of the information.

11:39.198 --> 11:43.201
Give it to me now,
or I'll start executing your men.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.747
This is war, Sobeck.

11:47.832 --> 11:51.126
They're all prepared to die
to protect that intel.

11:51.252 --> 11:52.502

11:52.878 --> 11:54.129
Really?

Sir, we have located the other group
and our droids are closing in on them.

12:09.311 --> 12:13.356
Your Jedi resolve
only delays the inevitable.

12:13.441 --> 12:17.944
Take them to Interrogation.
Torture them slowly.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.370
(R2-D2 BEEPING)

12:28.664 --> 12:30.957
So they were captured, huh?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.168
And now they're moving them to
the prison block?

12:33.252 --> 12:34.377
(R2-D2 BEEPING EXCITEDLY)

12:34.462 --> 12:37.964
Yes, sir! We will move to intercept them.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.674
(BLEEPING)

12:43.596 --> 12:45.346
We'll take them from here.

Uh, I think we have a...

12:47.016 --> 12:48.433
We'll handle it.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.310
Yes, sir!

13:03.741 --> 13:05.033
(BEEPING)

13:06.786 --> 13:09.370
Good to see you, Artoo.
I wondered where you've been.

13:09.455 --> 13:10.747
(BEEPING)

13:11.499 --> 13:13.875
The Commander is pleased to
see you as well, sir,

13:13.959 --> 13:16.628
but would like to return to the shuttle
as soon as possible.

13:16.712 --> 13:18.129
Yes, I couldn't agree more.

13:18.714 --> 13:20.381
CODY: What about General Skywalker, sir?

13:20.466 --> 13:23.051
Not to worry, he'll switch to plan B.

13:40.361 --> 13:44.697
(SIGHS) How much longer are we going to
wander through this tunnel in the dark?

13:44.740 --> 13:47.242
Captain Tarkin,
haven't you learned to trust me by now?

13:47.660 --> 13:50.370
You may have earned my trust,
General Skywalker,

13:50.412 --> 13:53.081
but my faith in your comrades
is still lacking.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.667
You lack faith in the Jedi.

13:55.876 --> 13:58.211
I find their tactics ineffective.

13:58.254 --> 14:02.048
The Jedi code prevents them from
going far enough to achieve victory.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.217
To do whatever it takes to win.

14:04.260 --> 14:07.887
The very reason why
peace keepers should not be leading a war.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.766
Have I offended you?

14:11.892 --> 14:14.519
No. I've also found that

14:14.603 --> 14:18.022
we sometimes fall short of victory
because of our methods.

14:18.107 --> 14:20.775
Well, I see we agree on something.

14:27.283 --> 14:28.950
I think I found a way out.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.001
What do you see, Snips?

14:38.460 --> 14:39.836
The coast is clear.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.796
Any sign of Obi-Wan and the shuttle?

14:42.131 --> 14:45.133
No, I don't see him or Artoo anywhere.

14:56.186 --> 14:58.938
There could be
a whole battalion of droids out there!

14:58.981 --> 15:01.524
Better than hiding in a fuel line.

15:23.005 --> 15:26.549
The plan's been compromised.
The shuttle's not coming.

15:47.696 --> 15:49.238
There's a plan B?

15:49.823 --> 15:54.202
There's always a backup plan.
We'll meet Artoo at Obi-Wan's position.

15:57.331 --> 15:59.540
Based on their recent position,

15:59.583 --> 16:03.336
we believe they're traveling
along this cave system.

16:05.255 --> 16:09.592
Uh, sir, the prisoners did not make it to
the interrogation level.

16:09.718 --> 16:13.888
What did you just say?

16:14.181 --> 16:16.391
Um, we think they might have...

16:16.517 --> 16:21.187
Sir, Count Dooku commands you to
contact him immediately.

16:28.570 --> 16:33.199
Inform Count Dooku that I am unreachable.
Send all units to the airfield.

16:35.786 --> 16:38.287
It's their only possible way of escape.

16:47.548 --> 16:50.425
Hold it!
Where are you going with these prisoners?

16:50.759 --> 16:52.427
We're transferring them
aboard the shuttle.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.095
From Citadel to Point Tarron.

16:54.555 --> 16:57.765
Point Tarron? There's no outpost there.

We need to launch a full-forward assault
and take that vessel!

We may have a bigger problem.
Those turrets. If we don't take them out,

18:05.626 --> 18:08.669
they will use them to destroy the shuttle
and prevent our escape.

18:08.796 --> 18:11.589
Which is precisely why
we should get aboard that shuttle,

18:11.673 --> 18:14.509
and use the weapon systems to
decimate those droids.

18:15.344 --> 18:18.346

we better do it fast.

a droid is manning one of those turrets.

They're going to blow up the shuttle, sir.

This is our only chance.
We've got to stop him.

I'm afraid we've had a situation
with the shuttle.

20:31.980 --> 20:34.815
By "situation," he means big explosion.

20:35.192 --> 20:36.400
We're going to need a rescue.

20:36.693 --> 20:39.570
It will be done.
I'm sending our cruisers now.

We'll need to hold out
until the Council sends a ship.

21:01.051 --> 21:05.429
Not a problem. We've beat them once,
we'll beat them again.

It was designed so it would be
almost impossible

21:18.485 --> 21:20.653
