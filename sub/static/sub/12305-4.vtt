00:30.482 --> 00:31.692
I feel safe with you, Brandon.

00:32.276 --> 00:34.403
You are the only one that understands.

00:34.820 --> 00:36.488
Tell me again it's gonna be okay.

00:37.531 --> 00:38.907
It's gonna be fine.

00:39.408 --> 00:41.285
Jess, it's all gonna be fine now.

01:42.846 --> 01:44.640
Jess... Jess, get up.

01:44.681 --> 01:46.016
Jess, please, baby, please,

01:46.517 --> 01:47.810
Jess, get up.

01:48.268 --> 01:49.103
Jess, get up.

01:49.728 --> 01:50.979
Jess, get up!

02:07.496 --> 02:09.497
Jess, Jess, I can't breathe.

02:17.047 --> 02:18.298
Help!

02:19.258 --> 02:20.592
Help!

02:27.266 --> 02:29.101
Help!

02:44.742 --> 02:46.910
First responders found
her outside of the car.

02:46.994 --> 02:48.412
Get an I.D. on the girl?

02:49.955 --> 02:51.707
Her name's Jessica Taylor.

02:52.499 --> 02:54.084
She was only 19 years old.

03:00.174 --> 03:01.800
And it appears...

03:05.596 --> 03:06.889
...that our victim...

03:10.726 --> 03:12.186
...wasn't alone.

03:13.729 --> 03:15.481
He's alive Let's call rescue.

03:16.607 --> 03:17.816
Send over the stretcher.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.276
Let's get him to the hospital.

04:14.942 --> 04:17.361
You'll be okay. We'll
get you to the hospital.

04:27.246 --> 04:28.539
Wow, this burned-out crime scene,

04:28.580 --> 04:29.832
it's gonna be tough to get evidence.

04:29.873 --> 04:32.376
Maybe not- I've got what
appears to be an accelerant.

04:33.043 --> 04:33.961
See that?

04:35.379 --> 04:36.130
It's reddish.

04:36.171 --> 04:38.173
My guess, it's a
petroleum-based substance.

04:38.340 --> 04:40.008
Well, mass spec'll be
able to tell us for sure,

04:40.050 --> 04:41.093
so I'll get it to the lab.

04:46.348 --> 04:47.391
Will you catch me up?

04:48.684 --> 04:50.853
Yeah. We got one dead, one in critical.

04:52.020 --> 04:53.856
Will you take a couple
of pictures of the crowd?

04:53.897 --> 04:55.691
I want to have their faces
on record just in case.

04:55.732 --> 04:57.276
You got it, CSI Duquesne.

04:57.568 --> 04:59.820
Thanks. Think we should
probably go ahead and get

04:59.862 --> 05:02.364
the car out of here as soon as
possible. I already called it in...

05:02.906 --> 05:04.074
CSI Duquesne.

05:20.924 --> 05:22.092
Are you okay?

05:23.677 --> 05:25.262
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

05:25.721 --> 05:26.889
You don't look fine.

05:28.682 --> 05:30.184
I just stood up too fast, that's all.

05:31.685 --> 05:32.770
All right.

06:01.840 --> 06:02.883
Hi, Alexx.

06:03.133 --> 06:06.678
Well, look at you,
with a nice, new suit.

06:07.137 --> 06:09.556
Okay, so you're either getting married,

06:10.015 --> 06:11.767
or you have a job interview.

06:12.017 --> 06:13.477
I got a job interview, actually.

06:13.519 --> 06:14.186
Um...

06:16.146 --> 06:17.189
hopefully, with you.

06:18.690 --> 06:20.067
I mean, look- I
shaved and everything.

06:20.359 --> 06:21.693
I thought you were working.

06:22.027 --> 06:23.278
At the gun range.

06:23.570 --> 06:25.197
At least until your review is over.

06:25.239 --> 06:28.367
Yeah, the money sucks, and I don't
want to be living off my credit cards.

06:29.243 --> 06:31.954
So now you want to be
an M.E. investigator.

06:32.704 --> 06:34.456
Well, I'm qualified, and, uh,

06:34.915 --> 06:36.667
your guys are stretched a little thin.

06:37.126 --> 06:40.462
You know, Ryan, I'm all
for you making a living,

06:40.796 --> 06:42.881
but I just don't have it in my budget.

06:44.800 --> 06:45.717
Alexx,

06:45.759 --> 06:46.885
I miss the job.

06:49.680 --> 06:50.973
I miss the team.

06:51.265 --> 06:52.766
We miss you, too, Ryan.

06:53.475 --> 06:55.018
Well, promise me you'll think about it.

06:55.060 --> 06:56.562
I'll think about it.

07:05.362 --> 07:06.280
Ryan...

07:07.156 --> 07:08.365
you have to go.

07:08.699 --> 07:10.659
Right now. Why? What's going on here?

07:10.909 --> 07:12.202
I can't share that with you.

07:12.244 --> 07:13.662
You're not a part of this investigation.

07:13.704 --> 07:14.663
I need you to leave.

07:22.796 --> 07:24.423
Somebody's got to get ahold of Horatio.

07:24.465 --> 07:26.467
Tell him to get down
here as soon as he can.

07:27.134 --> 07:28.677
I think I found something big.

07:30.053 --> 07:31.805
This was an inferno
when these kids died.

07:31.847 --> 07:32.556
How's the boy?

07:33.140 --> 07:34.266
He's in the hospital.

07:36.018 --> 07:38.771
So, I ran your mystery
substance from under the car.

07:39.229 --> 07:40.439
It's a little cocktail

07:40.481 --> 07:43.275
of glycol, ether and polyethylene.

07:43.901 --> 07:44.526
Brake fluid.

07:44.568 --> 07:45.986
So someone cut the brake line.

07:49.573 --> 07:50.282
Yeah.

07:54.244 --> 07:55.954
This was cut to cause a slow leak.

07:55.996 --> 07:57.998
So that means that it was
cut somewhere else, and they

07:58.040 --> 07:59.958
actually made it to the beach
before the brakes went out?

08:00.000 --> 08:02.169
Yeah. The fluid pooled
underneath the car.

08:04.922 --> 08:07.090
The catalytic converters on
these things run hot, don't they?

08:07.257 --> 08:09.176
Yeah, over 600 degrees.

08:09.468 --> 08:11.261
That's more than enough
to ignite brake fluid.

08:11.303 --> 08:12.763
The flash point's about 400.

08:13.013 --> 08:14.681
Perfect way to start a car fire.

08:22.940 --> 08:24.066
Whoever cut the brake line

08:24.149 --> 08:26.360
had to touch the master cylinder.

08:26.693 --> 08:29.154
And the car's burned so badly
you'll never get a print.

08:30.239 --> 08:32.157
Never say never.

09:00.686 --> 09:01.770
We get a print?

09:04.481 --> 09:05.566
Yep. Now...

09:06.483 --> 09:08.485
just need to connect it with a face.

09:08.527 --> 09:10.487
CSI Duquesne? You can call me Calleigh.

09:10.696 --> 09:12.030
Oh, right, uh, got it.

09:12.072 --> 09:13.657
Uh, have those pictures you asked for.

09:13.699 --> 09:14.658
Thank you, Mike.

09:17.703 --> 09:18.662
What'd he get?

09:21.248 --> 09:24.585
You. I thought you looked
like you saw a ghost out there.

09:26.253 --> 09:27.379
Don't worry about me.

09:28.380 --> 09:29.631
You don't have to be embarrassed.

09:29.673 --> 09:30.841
The doctor said after your injury

09:30.883 --> 09:32.968
that you might be up and
down, possibly for years.

09:33.927 --> 09:35.053
I guess I'm right on target.

09:35.471 --> 09:37.264
Come on, Eric, it's me.

09:38.015 --> 09:39.266
What'd you see out there?

09:44.271 --> 09:45.689
I saw evidence of arson.

09:55.240 --> 09:56.366
Andrew Hillman.

09:56.492 --> 09:57.367
Great.

10:01.038 --> 10:02.581
So you're adding murder

10:04.249 --> 10:06.001
to grand theft auto.

10:06.043 --> 10:07.753
Murder? Who died?

10:08.712 --> 10:10.088
Jessica Taylor.

10:10.672 --> 10:11.757
Jess?

10:12.257 --> 10:13.091
Yes.

10:13.133 --> 10:14.593
She's my girlfriend-
what happened?

10:14.802 --> 10:18.138
She burned to death this
morning in Brandon Fox's SUV,

10:18.180 --> 10:19.973
but then again, you know that,

10:20.808 --> 10:22.768
because you cut his brake line.

10:28.816 --> 10:29.983
I'm a mechanic.

10:30.692 --> 10:32.820
Jess asked me to work on
Brandon's SUV as a favor.

10:32.861 --> 10:34.071
He's a friend of hers from college.

10:34.113 --> 10:35.280
They've been hanging out a lot.

10:35.697 --> 10:38.659
In an attempt to kill off
the competition, my friend,

10:39.118 --> 10:41.286
you killed your own girlfriend, Jessica.

10:41.370 --> 10:42.913
You said she died in a fire.

10:42.955 --> 10:44.456
She did- a
fire started

10:44.790 --> 10:47.960
by the brake fluid from
the line that you cut.

10:48.710 --> 10:50.587
The only thing you have to prove that

10:51.171 --> 10:53.257
is my prints on a burnt piece of metal.

10:54.466 --> 10:55.968
And that's all I need.

11:03.684 --> 11:05.561
Alexx, do you have news for me?

11:05.644 --> 11:07.479
I didn't notice at first, Horatio,

11:07.521 --> 11:08.689
because of the soot.

11:09.022 --> 11:10.691
But take a look at her skin.

11:10.816 --> 11:12.568
It's cherry red.

11:13.026 --> 11:14.736
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

11:14.778 --> 11:18.365
Which causes the skin to take
on an almost healthy appearance.

11:24.037 --> 11:25.539
Soon as I noticed,

11:25.581 --> 11:27.082
I ran her tox screen.

11:29.668 --> 11:33.672
So you have 12,000 parts
per million CO in her blood.

11:34.006 --> 11:38.010
At those levels, that SUV had
to be full of carbon monoxide.

11:38.093 --> 11:40.554
She was deadbefore it started.

11:40.679 --> 11:41.889
Mmm. What about him?

11:42.014 --> 11:43.474
The boy in the car? Yeah.

11:43.682 --> 11:45.309
His tox popped close to 10,000,

11:45.392 --> 11:46.977
but he's still unconscious.

11:49.021 --> 11:50.439
So the question becomes,

11:50.481 --> 11:53.484
why did she die and he didn't?

11:53.901 --> 11:56.361
Look, Horatio, I know you
have someone you like for this,

11:56.570 --> 11:57.654
but I think

11:57.905 --> 12:00.282
we're looking at a
botched double suicide.

12:00.324 --> 12:02.659
Alexx, we missed something at the scene.

12:02.701 --> 12:04.077
Eric has to go back.

12:28.018 --> 12:29.186
Tim.

12:30.562 --> 12:31.688
That was you this morning.

12:33.565 --> 12:34.691
It's been a long time.

12:35.692 --> 12:36.860
Yes, it has.

12:39.029 --> 12:39.988
Why are you here?

12:40.823 --> 12:42.574
Well, I figured you could use my help.

12:43.242 --> 12:45.786
I mean, you always did, right?

12:50.457 --> 12:52.668
All right, then help.

12:53.710 --> 12:54.586
What am I missing?

12:56.338 --> 12:58.382
What's the first thing
you learn on the job?

12:58.423 --> 12:59.758
How to pad your time card.

13:00.008 --> 13:01.093
Second thing.

13:01.260 --> 13:02.886
Every person who enters a crime scene

13:03.262 --> 13:05.264
brings something in and
takes something away.

13:05.681 --> 13:07.558
Even before we call it a scene.

13:07.808 --> 13:08.434
What are you saying?

13:08.475 --> 13:10.269
Someone took evidence
before we even arrived?

13:12.020 --> 13:13.981
How do I find something
that's not even here?

13:14.815 --> 13:16.358
Just because you can't see something

13:16.400 --> 13:17.484
doesn't mean it's not there.

13:45.929 --> 13:47.055
Piece of tubing.

13:50.809 --> 13:52.352
It's got to be part of the crime scene.

13:53.353 --> 13:54.688
Speedle?

14:04.281 --> 14:05.574
Thanks for the help.

14:16.019 --> 14:17.938
Our dead girl was living large.

14:18.146 --> 14:19.439
That's a nice laptop.

14:19.689 --> 14:21.817
Expensive item for a college student.

14:22.150 --> 14:23.193
And, judging

14:23.235 --> 14:25.237
by her wardrobe, she's
never met a designer

14:25.278 --> 14:26.238
that shedidn't like.

14:26.363 --> 14:28.907
Hey, you know what? I know
that this is a complete sidebar,

14:28.949 --> 14:30.909
but this is the coffee
machine that I want.

14:31.159 --> 14:32.369
It makes espressos,

14:32.411 --> 14:33.078
macchiatos,

14:33.120 --> 14:34.371
cappuccinos. Everything.

14:34.413 --> 14:36.623
When would I ever make a macchiato?

14:36.915 --> 14:38.542
Well, you would make one every morning,

14:38.917 --> 14:40.210
after we buy the machine.

14:44.381 --> 14:47.217
Now, there's the dorm
room that I rember.

14:48.385 --> 14:49.678
And there's the rest of it.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.638
I'll pick it up. There
could be a name attached.

14:52.139 --> 14:53.098
Well, if you're gonna pick that up,

14:53.140 --> 14:55.016
you're gonna need to put
on a second pair of gloves.

14:55.142 --> 14:55.767
Well, you know what?

14:55.809 --> 14:57.811
How about this? Cooper
wants to be a CSI.

14:57.853 --> 14:59.146
I'll have him come in and pick it up.

15:01.690 --> 15:03.233
Jessica got a phone message.

15:04.693 --> 15:05.610
Hi, Jessica.

15:05.694 --> 15:08.321
It's Liberty Coast credit calling again.

15:08.488 --> 15:09.740
You're three months behind.

15:10.157 --> 15:12.117
You're in the red. You have relatives.

15:12.242 --> 15:13.243
Borrow from them.

15:14.703 --> 15:15.662
Li-Co again.

15:15.704 --> 15:18.749
Jessica, you can charge all
the expensive makeup you want

15:18.790 --> 15:20.167
to look hot for the college guys.

15:20.208 --> 15:22.711
You're still nothing
but trailer park trash.

15:23.462 --> 15:25.130
Jessica, this is South Beach Media.

15:25.338 --> 15:27.716
We received a disturbing call
from Liberty Coast Credit.

15:27.924 --> 15:29.134
Apparently, you're not the type

15:29.176 --> 15:30.343
of young woman we thought you were.

15:31.136 --> 15:32.429
Were rescinding our job offer.

15:33.138 --> 15:34.139
That's pretty harsh.

15:35.140 --> 15:38.518
Yeah. She bought all
this stuff on credit.

15:39.144 --> 15:42.147
Sounds like she was in over her head.

15:43.148 --> 15:44.316
And I'll bet she was terrified.

15:44.691 --> 15:46.443
That could cause a girl
to take her own life.

15:47.569 --> 15:48.779
You know what? I'm going to call Tripp

15:48.820 --> 15:50.822
and have him go over to
the office at Liberty Coast.

15:53.617 --> 15:56.244
All right, well, you know
where to send the check.

15:56.286 --> 15:57.704
If you don't make a payment right now,

15:57.746 --> 15:59.122
I'm going after your parents' house.

15:59.498 --> 16:00.207
Cry all you want.

16:00.248 --> 16:01.917
It's not my problem you
don't have the money.

16:01.958 --> 16:02.709
Can I help you, Officer?

16:03.460 --> 16:04.544
Who's in charge here?

16:04.920 --> 16:06.129
Well, I guess that would be me.

16:06.805 --> 16:08.640
Keith Reynolds. I'm the credit manager.

16:09.099 --> 16:09.891
Is there a problem?

16:09.933 --> 16:12.143
Yeah. One of your
clients. Jessica Taylor.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.229
What about her?

16:14.771 --> 16:15.939
The lady is dead.

16:17.440 --> 16:18.817
What does that have to do with Li-Co?

16:18.900 --> 16:19.984
Someone from this office

16:20.026 --> 16:21.820
made threatening phone calls to her.

16:21.986 --> 16:25.657
Yeah. That's their job. Look,
I got to get to Dade U, so if...?

16:25.699 --> 16:27.617
I want to know who handled her account.

16:28.451 --> 16:29.327
You got a warrant?

16:30.120 --> 16:31.538
We will in one phone call.

16:32.664 --> 16:33.415
Good.

16:33.540 --> 16:34.916
Place is loaded with phones.

16:39.879 --> 16:41.339
Is that the tubing you
found at the crime scene?

16:42.007 --> 16:42.924
Yeah.

16:43.675 --> 16:45.135
So, how did you miss that
the first time around?

16:45.218 --> 16:46.845
It was outside of our tape perimeter.

16:47.762 --> 16:49.639
So, you know, what made
you look there this time?

16:51.224 --> 16:52.142
Just a hunch.

16:54.561 --> 16:56.521
Think it's connected to the SUV fire?

16:57.105 --> 16:58.231
Seems likely.

16:58.565 --> 17:01.234
See the rag on the end?
That's how you seal a tube

17:01.276 --> 17:02.527
into the exhaust of a running car.

17:02.777 --> 17:04.738
Shove the other end
through a car window,

17:04.779 --> 17:05.821
and that's how you pump carbon

17:05.864 --> 17:07.031
monoxide into a car.

17:17.459 --> 17:19.836
Jess, please, baby, please get up!

17:20.462 --> 17:22.339
Prints should tell us
who put the other end

17:22.380 --> 17:23.339
in the exhaust pipe.

17:24.549 --> 17:26.509
Wait. I thought this was a suicide.

17:27.218 --> 17:29.012
Wouldn't that belong to
one of the kids in the SUV?

17:29.429 --> 17:30.638
You're assuming, Cooper.

17:31.014 --> 17:32.015
Let the evidence tell us.

17:34.434 --> 17:36.436
So, uh... what's it telling us?

17:37.437 --> 17:38.730
Well, it's telling us

17:40.023 --> 17:42.734
that this is a murder, and
we're looking at a killer.

17:46.988 --> 17:49.616
H, yeah, I just got a
shortcut to your warrant.

17:53.195 --> 17:55.572
I don't care if it was
your husband's funeral.

17:55.614 --> 17:57.949
If I don't have a payment
on my desk in a week,

17:57.991 --> 17:59.034
it'll be your funeral!

18:00.619 --> 18:01.828
Or yours.

18:03.705 --> 18:05.123
I can see why you have a long list

18:05.165 --> 18:06.333
of TROs, Mr. Hardwick.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.876
Come on. This is a contact sport.

18:07.918 --> 18:09.419
And sometimes you got
to get a little rough.

18:10.128 --> 18:11.088
It's all part of the game.

18:11.129 --> 18:13.840
Was part of the game
killing Jessica Taylor?

18:14.591 --> 18:15.342
What are you talking about?

18:15.467 --> 18:16.927
We found your fingerprints

18:16.968 --> 18:17.928
on the murder weapon.

18:18.387 --> 18:20.639
The tube that fed the
carbon monoxide to the SUV.

18:21.139 --> 18:23.141
You tried to make it look
like a suicide gone bad.

18:23.183 --> 18:24.351
Why would I kill my own client?

18:24.393 --> 18:26.645
I don't know. Maybe she
wasn't making payments.

18:27.145 --> 18:28.522
Maybe better business to get rid of her.

18:29.147 --> 18:30.148
You don't get it.

18:30.357 --> 18:31.942
The longer they stay in debt,

18:32.025 --> 18:33.110
the more money we make.

18:33.360 --> 18:35.737
And a dead client means
no more prime-plus-20.

18:36.613 --> 18:40.033
Ah, Horatio, Brandon Fox just woke up.

18:40.826 --> 18:41.535
What does that mean?

18:41.910 --> 18:43.328
That means we have an eyewitness.

18:43.704 --> 18:44.538
That's what it means.

18:57.718 --> 18:59.010
Brandon, I'm Calleigh Duquesne.

18:59.261 --> 19:00.095
This is Eric Delko.

19:00.137 --> 19:01.430
We're with Miami-Dade PD.

19:02.264 --> 19:03.014
How you doing?

19:03.598 --> 19:04.850
I got a burn on my arm.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.144
And they're making
sure my lungs are okay.

19:08.353 --> 19:09.646
How's Jess? Is she okay?

19:10.689 --> 19:12.524
I'm so sorry for your loss.

19:15.152 --> 19:17.029
Brandon, can you tell us what happened?

19:20.699 --> 19:21.825
We were at the beach.

19:22.367 --> 19:23.243
We were going to...

19:23.910 --> 19:25.620
you know... have sex.

19:25.954 --> 19:28.248
And the next thing I
knew, the car was on fire.

19:35.255 --> 19:37.924
Jess, please, baby, please get up!

19:39.134 --> 19:40.135
I'll get help!

19:47.142 --> 19:50.228
I tried to save her, I swear,
but she wouldn't wake up.

19:50.687 --> 19:52.022
That's because she was already dead.

19:53.148 --> 19:54.107
What... what are you talking about?

19:54.149 --> 19:56.318
Jessica died from carbon
monoxide poisoning.

19:57.903 --> 20:00.322
There was a piece of tubing we found

20:00.906 --> 20:02.532
that pumped exhaust into your SUV.

20:03.241 --> 20:04.409
Someone tried to kill us?

20:04.701 --> 20:06.745
Do you have any idea
how that tube got there?

20:07.120 --> 20:09.331
No. No, I don't.

20:11.375 --> 20:14.336
My God. Who would want to kill Jess?

20:15.128 --> 20:16.421
That's what we're going to find out.

20:29.267 --> 20:30.143
Buckle up.

20:30.185 --> 20:31.019
I'm trying.

20:32.729 --> 20:33.939
What, are you digging for change?

20:34.481 --> 20:36.733
Ooh! I think I found
something even better.

20:43.156 --> 20:44.032
Oh, my God.

20:44.157 --> 20:45.325
What, is it a Platinum card?

20:46.159 --> 20:47.828
This is Speedle's credit card.

20:48.704 --> 20:49.329
I knew it.

20:50.038 --> 20:51.039
What is going on?

20:53.709 --> 20:55.127
Nothing. Look...

20:55.919 --> 20:57.254
Eric, if we are gonna
be working together,

20:57.295 --> 20:58.630
you have to talk to me.

20:59.131 --> 21:00.132
Look, I said it's nothing.

21:00.465 --> 21:01.925
Does it have something
to do with me and Jake?

21:01.967 --> 21:02.884
Is there a problem?

21:02.926 --> 21:04.511
No, Calleigh. Don't be ridiculous.

21:04.803 --> 21:07.139
Well, you've been acting
strange with me all day,

21:07.472 --> 21:09.349
so what else am I supposed to think?

21:12.602 --> 21:13.645
Let's just forget about it.

21:14.479 --> 21:16.148
Can I have Speedle's card, please?

21:29.494 --> 21:30.829
Yeah, this is Tim Speedle.

21:30.954 --> 21:32.914
I'm calling to check
the status of my account.

21:33.915 --> 21:36.043
My card number-
yeah, it's

21:36.084 --> 21:40.047
007-214-29.

21:44.801 --> 21:45.844
Active?

21:47.512 --> 21:48.513
For how long?

21:50.140 --> 21:51.016
Two weeks?

21:51.266 --> 21:52.309
Are you sure?

21:57.147 --> 21:59.149
What was the date of
my last transaction?

22:01.818 --> 22:04.029
No, I don't... I don't
remember my password right now.

22:04.071 --> 22:05.447
I'll have to call you back.

22:07.574 --> 22:08.575
No, I don't want to make a payment

22:08.617 --> 22:09.826
over the phone, thank you.

22:15.499 --> 22:16.708
Hey, where's Valera?

22:17.167 --> 22:18.710
Last time I saw her she
was in the locker room.

22:19.378 --> 22:22.005
Oh. She was going to run some DNA for me

22:22.047 --> 22:24.132
of the condom that we found
in Jessica Taylor's dorm room.

22:24.466 --> 22:25.717
You have got great timing, missy,

22:25.759 --> 22:26.927
'cause I'm just getting the results.

22:27.386 --> 22:28.345
Oh, great.

22:30.589 --> 22:31.715
Is it Brandon Fox?

22:31.881 --> 22:33.049
Keith Reynolds.

22:33.133 --> 22:34.593
Off an old sexual assault charge.

22:34.634 --> 22:36.011
Is he even one of our players?

22:36.469 --> 22:38.847
He's a manager at Liberty Coast Credit.

22:39.889 --> 22:42.684
In fact, Tripp said that he was
on his was up to Dade University

22:42.726 --> 22:43.727
to sign up more students.

22:44.019 --> 22:45.645
Well, that's where
Jessica was signed up.

22:46.021 --> 22:48.315
Do you think she was trying
to sleep her way out of debt

22:48.356 --> 22:49.316
and she crossed the wrong guy?

22:49.566 --> 22:50.942
There's only one way to find out.

22:58.575 --> 23:00.243
Hi. Would you like a credit card?

23:00.368 --> 23:01.620
Free Frisbee if you sign up today.

23:03.038 --> 23:05.332
Really, that was the lamest
sales pitch I've ever heard.

23:06.124 --> 23:07.334
What? The guy wasn't interested.

23:07.792 --> 23:09.210
You've got to make him interested.

23:09.461 --> 23:10.545
Use your assets.

23:11.463 --> 23:13.423
All these kids, they're running
out of their parents' money.

23:13.590 --> 23:14.549
They're ripe.

23:14.591 --> 23:15.508
Go after them.

23:17.552 --> 23:18.428
Watch this.

23:19.554 --> 23:20.513
Excuse me. How you doing?

23:20.597 --> 23:22.140
Hey, beautiful. Hi.

23:22.557 --> 23:24.434
My name is Keith. How would you like to

23:24.476 --> 23:25.644
buy a new wardrobe today?

23:25.810 --> 23:27.395
You're pre-approved for $2,000.

23:27.437 --> 23:29.648
Your minimum payment is $17 a month.

23:29.689 --> 23:31.316
I don't know, does your card offer

23:31.358 --> 23:32.984
a sexual favor payment plan,

23:33.026 --> 23:35.237
or is that just a side business, Keith?

23:35.695 --> 23:37.530
We're with the Miami-Dade
Police Department.

23:38.031 --> 23:38.782
What were you doing

23:38.823 --> 23:40.617
in Jessica Taylor's
dorm room last night?

23:40.659 --> 23:42.035
I wasn't in her dorm room last night.

23:42.327 --> 23:43.620
Your DNA says otherwise.

23:43.912 --> 23:47.123
We have evidence says you had
sex with her, Mr. Reynolds.

23:48.583 --> 23:50.126
If that's the case,
I'm not talking to you.

23:51.002 --> 23:51.878
How about I have my lawyer

23:51.920 --> 23:52.629
give you two a call?

23:52.671 --> 23:54.631
Do that, 'cause you
couldn't look more guilty

23:54.673 --> 23:55.548
than you do right now.

24:00.553 --> 24:02.681
Looks like we just found
ourselves a prime suspect.

24:02.722 --> 24:04.015
Yeah, looks like it.

24:13.692 --> 24:14.943
get down

24:18.446 --> 24:19.823
got you,come on,i got you

24:22.117 --> 24:23.034
Calleigh, you all right?

24:23.326 --> 24:24.035
Yeah, fine.

24:25.120 --> 24:26.288
Calleigh Duquesne, CSI Miami.

24:26.329 --> 24:28.832
We've got shots fired. We need
assistance. Dade University.

24:29.374 --> 24:30.333
It stopped.

24:32.127 --> 24:33.044
Ma'am, are you okay?

24:33.336 --> 24:34.129
Are you hurt, are you shot?

24:34.170 --> 24:34.713
I don't know.

24:36.673 --> 24:37.424
Is she shot?

24:37.549 --> 24:39.718
No. There's blood, though.
I didn't see anything.

24:39.759 --> 24:41.845
Did you see where the
shooting was coming from?

24:41.886 --> 24:43.346
No, but I know who
they were shooting at.

24:44.681 --> 24:46.433
Prime suspect just became a victim.

24:56.194 --> 25:00.031
All right, guys. He's yours.

25:01.199 --> 25:03.660
Preserve his head for any
ballistic evidence, all right?

25:07.497 --> 25:08.206
None of these kids

25:08.248 --> 25:09.958
saw or heard where the shots came from.

25:10.166 --> 25:11.251
I was here when it happened, Frank.

25:11.292 --> 25:12.627
I couldn't tell you
where they came from.

25:13.503 --> 25:15.630
Calleigh said the rounds
were from a 30-ought-six.

25:15.672 --> 25:17.757
She took the casings
back to the lab. I got...

25:18.758 --> 25:21.928
guys on the perimeter if
you, uh... need anything.

25:22.971 --> 25:23.930
You're welcome.

25:24.973 --> 25:25.932
Speed.

25:29.644 --> 25:30.520
What's going on?

25:32.522 --> 25:33.523
Eric.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.443
What's going on?

25:37.944 --> 25:39.237
I'm just reading the crime scene.

25:42.657 --> 25:43.324
Yeah.

25:48.955 --> 25:49.998
You see this?

25:50.039 --> 25:51.040
This is, uh...

25:51.458 --> 25:52.959
this is a bullet hole.

25:57.630 --> 26:00.049
Yeah, that's what he meant.

26:02.260 --> 26:03.553
Who, baby?

26:07.223 --> 26:07.682
The shooter,

26:07.724 --> 26:09.434
he hid behind these bushes here.

26:09.476 --> 26:11.061
That's why nobody saw him.

26:11.102 --> 26:12.145
Uh-huh.

26:14.022 --> 26:15.732
Whatever it is...

26:16.024 --> 26:19.527
you want to talk, you find me.

26:20.445 --> 26:21.154
Okay?

26:35.126 --> 26:36.544
Hmm. Here's something.

26:37.545 --> 26:38.338
Look at that.

26:42.050 --> 26:43.760
Looks like dried perspiration.

26:48.431 --> 26:51.434
Whatever little bit of
DNA might have been there,

26:51.476 --> 26:53.103
in the sweat evaporated.

26:53.144 --> 26:55.230
What about the DNA that
soaked into the leaf?

26:55.271 --> 26:56.940
It's impossible to find it.

26:57.023 --> 27:00.151
My friend, you've not
seen our newest toy.

27:00.360 --> 27:02.112
The Maxwell 16.

27:02.153 --> 27:03.238
It dissolves everything

27:03.279 --> 27:04.948
but the DNA.

27:22.924 --> 27:24.551
Matches one of our elimination samples

27:24.592 --> 27:26.136
from the Jessica Taylor murder.

27:26.719 --> 27:28.138
Gary Hardwick.

27:31.850 --> 27:33.727
Why would I shoot a guy I work with?

27:33.768 --> 27:35.687
Because he was your competion.

27:35.729 --> 27:37.856
I was at the campus today,
but you don't know why

27:37.897 --> 27:39.315
Why don't you enlighten me?

27:39.357 --> 27:41.025
I was trying to catch Keith in the act.

27:41.067 --> 27:43.111
He likes working these
collegiate accounts

27:43.153 --> 27:45.155
because it gives him
access to the coeds.

27:45.196 --> 27:46.197
You know what I mean. Yes.

27:46.239 --> 27:48.450
I do know what you mean.
Like Jessica Taylor.

27:48.491 --> 27:49.617
And she wasn't the only one.

27:49.659 --> 27:51.953
He promises these young girls
who get in over their heads

27:51.995 --> 27:54.456
that he'll erase their
debt for a few favors.

27:54.831 --> 27:57.333
You told me I'd always be
able to meet the minimums.

27:58.960 --> 28:00.545
Connie, can't you get any

28:00.587 --> 28:02.130
more money from your sister?

28:02.172 --> 28:03.631
She's tapped out.

28:04.257 --> 28:06.843
Well, there might be
one way you can erase

28:06.885 --> 28:08.136
this month's debt.

28:10.346 --> 28:11.639
That's why you should be looking

28:11.681 --> 28:12.932
at his client list and not at me.

28:12.974 --> 28:14.017
I'm the good guy here.

28:14.059 --> 28:16.644
Why were you at both of
my crime scenes, then?

28:16.686 --> 28:18.229
I didn't kill Keith Reynolds.

28:18.271 --> 28:19.522
I have your fingerprints

28:19.564 --> 28:20.690
at the car fire.

28:20.732 --> 28:23.151
I don't know how my
fingerprints got there.

28:23.193 --> 28:24.736
I don't know what you want me to say.

28:25.528 --> 28:26.821
I'll let you know.

28:31.451 --> 28:32.744
Calleigh, you got to see this.

28:32.786 --> 28:33.995
I'll swing back around, okay?

28:34.037 --> 28:36.915
It can't wait. All right, what you got?

28:36.956 --> 28:38.958
I was going through Liberty
Coast's collection accounts

28:39.000 --> 28:41.336
to see who had motive
to kill Keith Reynolds.

28:42.045 --> 28:44.547
And I found this instead.

28:44.839 --> 28:46.049
Isn't that the kid in the hospital?

28:46.091 --> 28:47.759
Brandon Fox, yeah.

28:48.134 --> 28:50.720
He never told us he had a
credit card with Liberty Coast.

28:51.429 --> 28:53.223
Take a look at his account balance.

28:55.225 --> 28:56.142
Wow.

28:56.643 --> 29:00.021
All right, well, that's more
than twice what Jessica owed.

29:00.063 --> 29:02.107
I mean, he's barely making
his minimum payments.

29:02.148 --> 29:04.150
Yeah, at 20% it would
take him an entire lifetime

29:04.192 --> 29:05.610
to pay it off.

29:05.652 --> 29:07.237
Let's see who signed him up.

29:10.448 --> 29:11.658
Gary Hardwick.

29:11.741 --> 29:13.326
Isn't that the other credit card guy?

29:13.660 --> 29:16.037
Yeah. It says here that he gave him

29:16.079 --> 29:18.164
a free gift when he signed up.

29:18.206 --> 29:20.250
It's a party drink dispenser.

29:20.750 --> 29:22.001
What is that? Oh, come on,

29:22.043 --> 29:23.837
you forgot your college days already?

29:23.878 --> 29:25.130
It's a beer bong.

29:27.757 --> 29:29.342
That's what the tubing is.

29:32.637 --> 29:34.139
Now that you got our card...

29:34.639 --> 29:36.057
use it to buy some beer.

29:38.852 --> 29:40.186
That explains why
Hardwick's prints were on it.

29:40.228 --> 29:42.522
He gave the bong to Brandon.
It was Brandon's all along.

29:42.564 --> 29:43.648
So what does this mean?

29:43.857 --> 29:45.525
It means Alexx is right.

29:45.859 --> 29:47.110
It was a double suicide,

29:47.152 --> 29:49.320
except only Jessica was successful.

29:58.455 --> 29:59.622
Everything went wrong.

29:59.831 --> 30:03.543
So you and Jessica had a
pact to kill yourselves.

30:03.585 --> 30:04.586
Not that it mattered.

30:04.669 --> 30:05.628
We were already dead.

30:06.546 --> 30:09.549
Liberty Coast killed us the
day we signed up for that card.

30:09.632 --> 30:11.092
Are you sure you want to do this, Jess?

30:11.134 --> 30:14.137
These credit card people
have destroyed our lives.

30:14.179 --> 30:16.389
He told me he'd take my parents' house.

30:16.431 --> 30:19.851
And they toldyouyou wouldn't
pay this off till you're 52.

30:20.060 --> 30:21.728
It's our only way out.

30:21.936 --> 30:22.937
Okay.

30:25.732 --> 30:27.192
They kept raising my credit limit,

30:27.233 --> 30:29.360
so I figured it was
okay to buy more stuff.

30:29.527 --> 30:31.654
Pretty soon, I was using
my tuition to pay it down.

30:33.031 --> 30:34.741
I had to drop out of school.

30:36.659 --> 30:39.621
How am I going to make
money without a degree?

30:41.039 --> 30:43.333
And Hardwick told me it was
fine to make minimum payments.

30:43.374 --> 30:44.959
But what he didn't tell
me is the interest fees

30:45.001 --> 30:46.753
compounded into the stratosphere.

30:48.129 --> 30:49.422
If I had Paris Hilton's money

30:50.048 --> 30:52.050
I still wouldn't be able to pay it off.

30:53.051 --> 30:54.135
Look...

30:54.552 --> 30:56.137
we were just supposed to fall asleep

30:56.179 --> 30:57.722
and let the carbon monoxide do the rest.

31:00.141 --> 31:01.726
We thought it would be painless.

31:02.936 --> 31:06.147
When I was in the fire,
I thought I was dead.

31:07.023 --> 31:10.235
And all I wanted was to be
back here with Jess alive.

31:29.129 --> 31:31.423
I mean... Jess should
be here instead of me.

31:33.925 --> 31:36.428
Did she mention Keith Reynolds to you?

31:37.554 --> 31:39.139
The other credit guy? Mm-hmm.

31:40.432 --> 31:41.933
No. Why?

31:42.142 --> 31:43.935
He was killed this afternoon.

31:44.352 --> 31:45.353
Really?

31:47.021 --> 31:49.649
That's the first piece of
good news I've heard all day.

31:50.442 --> 31:52.235
I'm happy for you.

31:58.533 --> 32:01.745
Calleigh, dispatch told me
you came back to the scene.

32:01.786 --> 32:02.412
What's up?

32:02.454 --> 32:04.330
Yeah, you know the
leaves you brought in?

32:04.372 --> 32:06.249
They didn't have any gunpowder on them.

32:06.291 --> 32:07.083
You sure?

32:07.125 --> 32:09.335
That means that the shooter
wasn't behind the bushes.

32:09.377 --> 32:11.296
I know, but he had to be somewhere,

32:11.337 --> 32:13.339
so I came back, because
I think our best bet

32:13.381 --> 32:15.049
is to recreate the scene.

32:25.811 --> 32:26.604
All right.

32:26.812 --> 32:29.190
The shooting started, we were, uh...

32:30.608 --> 32:31.650
we were right there.

32:31.692 --> 32:33.694
The first shot was the lamppost.

32:34.612 --> 32:36.197
The second shot hit here.

32:36.822 --> 32:37.823
Could have figured out direction then if

32:37.865 --> 32:39.200
we had seen it.

32:39.325 --> 32:41.202
And then everybody started panicking.

32:43.120 --> 32:44.705
And then came the kill shot.

32:46.999 --> 32:47.875
When Reynolds got hit

32:47.917 --> 32:50.169
he spun around, making it impossible

32:50.211 --> 32:52.713
to tell which direction
the bullet came from.

32:53.297 --> 32:55.591
I think we should walk
the action in reverse.

32:58.010 --> 32:59.887
Now we know the direction of the shot.

33:00.012 --> 33:01.597
We have two points on the bullet's path.

33:01.639 --> 33:03.849
The entrance wound and the bushes.

33:03.891 --> 33:05.726
And if the shot didn't
come from the bushes,

33:05.768 --> 33:08.187
that means that it would've come from...

33:09.313 --> 33:10.272
the restaurant.

33:10.314 --> 33:12.358
It's not possible. Tripp checked it out.

33:12.400 --> 33:14.402
It's being remodeled.
It's crawling with workers.

33:14.443 --> 33:15.611
There's no way the shooter

33:15.653 --> 33:16.821
wouldn't have been seen.

33:20.616 --> 33:22.493
We forgot about Kentucky Windage.

33:23.994 --> 33:25.162
The path the bullet was traveling

33:25.204 --> 33:26.789
didn't travel in a
straight line. Exactly.

33:26.914 --> 33:28.624
I mean, it's just a
guess, but I would say that

33:28.666 --> 33:29.250
at the time of the shooting

33:29.291 --> 33:32.586
the wind was gusting at
about... 20 miles per hour.

33:32.628 --> 33:35.923
You said these rounds were
fired from a 30.06, right?

33:35.965 --> 33:38.426
Given that, I can calculate
the minute of angle.

33:38.592 --> 33:39.802
The minute of angle?

33:40.094 --> 33:40.845
Minute of angle

33:40.886 --> 33:42.388
is the amount the path of the bullet

33:42.430 --> 33:43.848
was altered by the wind.

33:43.889 --> 33:45.391
And that'll tell us the real direction

33:45.433 --> 33:46.767
that the bullet was fired from.

33:46.809 --> 33:49.895
In this case, there was
about five minutes of angle.

33:50.688 --> 33:51.897
Which means...

33:52.189 --> 33:54.316
the shot didn't come
from the restaurant.

33:55.025 --> 33:57.111
That's what Speedle was talking about.

33:57.194 --> 33:57.987
What?

33:59.697 --> 34:00.614
Nothing.

34:01.323 --> 34:03.325
Uh, the bullet was fired
from over the water.

34:03.492 --> 34:05.494
Means that the shooter was on a boat.

34:12.293 --> 34:14.920
The ferry traverses the
bay every 45 minutes,

34:14.962 --> 34:17.505
which meant it would've
been 100 yards off campus

34:17.547 --> 34:19.007
at the time of the shooting.

34:19.592 --> 34:21.510
At mid-day, this place
must've been loaded

34:21.552 --> 34:22.803
with passengers.

34:23.012 --> 34:24.304
Except up here.

34:24.889 --> 34:25.556
What do you mean?

34:25.598 --> 34:27.725
Well, this is the observation deck.

34:28.309 --> 34:29.810
It was closed for maintenance.

34:30.018 --> 34:31.270
Boat was traveling northeast,

34:31.312 --> 34:33.105
the shooter had to be
on the starboard side.

34:33.147 --> 34:35.274
No one reported seeing anything unusual.

34:35.315 --> 34:38.527
30.06, he would've had to
have supported the barrel

34:38.569 --> 34:39.862
to get off a clean shot.

34:39.904 --> 34:41.822
Then there should be burnt
gunshot residue on the ground.

34:41.864 --> 34:42.822
I'll test for it.

34:53.626 --> 34:54.710
It's blue.

34:58.422 --> 34:59.715
Shooter stood here.

35:10.726 --> 35:12.311
Got some kind of odd trace here.

35:12.353 --> 35:13.687
Looks like iodine.

35:13.896 --> 35:15.189
It's creamy.

35:15.314 --> 35:17.108
It's povidone, it's an
iodine-based antiseptic

35:17.149 --> 35:19.151
used to treat burns. And who do we

35:19.193 --> 35:21.695
know that's in the hospital
being treated for burns?

35:23.197 --> 35:24.407
So, Brandon...

35:24.698 --> 35:27.910
your nurse tells me that you
went missing this afternoon.

35:28.411 --> 35:29.995
I went for a walk down the hall...

35:31.205 --> 35:32.706
...to test my lungs out.

35:38.587 --> 35:39.547
Positive.

35:39.588 --> 35:40.923
Gunshot residue.

35:41.298 --> 35:45.511
Please don't continue to insult me.

35:46.512 --> 35:47.513
What happened?

35:49.014 --> 35:50.015
When...

35:50.808 --> 35:52.017
when Jess called me last night,

35:52.059 --> 35:53.853
she was crying so hard.

35:53.894 --> 35:55.813
Was that after she had
sex with Keith Reynolds?

35:55.855 --> 35:57.398
He went back on his deal.

35:58.816 --> 35:59.525
When he left her,

35:59.567 --> 36:00.860
he laughed.

36:00.901 --> 36:01.819
He didn't reduce her debt

36:01.861 --> 36:02.611
a penny.

36:02.695 --> 36:05.698
So you're saying that
Keith drove her to suicide.

36:06.323 --> 36:07.700
That's why I did it.

36:08.117 --> 36:09.827
I killed him for her.

36:21.422 --> 36:22.965
He deserved to die.

36:23.007 --> 36:24.800
On the contrary, Brandon...

36:25.301 --> 36:28.012
no one deserves to die.

36:40.107 --> 36:42.610
You're looking in Speed's locker, Eric.

36:47.698 --> 36:50.409
Out of respect, I haven't
touched it since he was shot.

36:50.826 --> 36:52.411
Now his wallet's missing.

36:52.703 --> 36:54.121
What do you think happened?

36:55.915 --> 36:57.374
Maybe he took it.

36:57.416 --> 36:59.710
There's been some activity
on his credit card.

37:00.503 --> 37:01.504
Eric...

37:04.507 --> 37:09.011
when someone that is
important to us leaves us,

37:09.095 --> 37:12.390
it can be difficult
to accept they're gone.

37:13.307 --> 37:14.600
No, this is different.

37:15.017 --> 37:16.185
I know this sounds crazy,

37:16.227 --> 37:18.687
but he pointed me in the
direction of that tube.

37:19.522 --> 37:21.023
He solved this case.

37:21.399 --> 37:23.192
You solved that case.

37:23.692 --> 37:24.693
You did.

37:27.405 --> 37:28.197
Eric...

37:29.198 --> 37:30.616
Speed is gone.

37:32.326 --> 37:33.494
He's gone.

37:34.912 --> 37:36.622
What if I told you I talked to him?

37:37.790 --> 37:39.291
I'd say...

37:40.501 --> 37:42.795
I'd say that it's time to get some help.

37:50.594 --> 37:52.179
As I said, Lieutenant,

37:52.221 --> 37:54.014
I'm sorry you drove all this way to our

37:54.056 --> 37:55.266
Naples branch.

37:55.307 --> 37:57.518
But without a warrant,
I'm not at liberty

37:57.560 --> 37:59.687
to discuss our customers' accounts.

38:04.400 --> 38:06.861
The customer's name is Tim Speedle,

38:06.902 --> 38:10.114
and I'm interested in
any account activity.

38:10.322 --> 38:11.824
First of all, this account has

38:11.866 --> 38:13.325
been dormant for three years.

38:13.826 --> 38:16.120
I stand corrected. It was...

38:16.620 --> 38:18.205
up until two weeks ago.

38:18.247 --> 38:19.707
Two weeks ago.

38:19.915 --> 38:22.001
Since a duplicate was requested.

38:22.209 --> 38:24.003
I have purchases at the Coastliner,

38:25.504 --> 38:27.047
several at the Zoba Cafe,

38:27.089 --> 38:29.550
and a number of
transactions at Club Fate.

38:29.592 --> 38:32.386
And if I'm not mistaken,
there's some activity right now

38:32.595 --> 38:34.096
Purchases just made.

38:34.138 --> 38:35.598
Do you have a location?

38:35.681 --> 38:37.099
McKenna's on the Bay.

38:40.311 --> 38:41.812
Thank you very much.

38:42.897 --> 38:44.356
Eric, go to McKenna's.

38:44.398 --> 38:46.901
Somebody is using Speed's card.

38:59.121 --> 39:00.706
You know what, I'm going to
go check with the bartender,

39:00.748 --> 39:02.416
see if I can get some receipts.

39:02.917 --> 39:03.626
All right.

39:21.727 --> 39:22.603
Speed.

39:26.190 --> 39:28.025
Sorry, man. Thought
you were someone else.

39:28.067 --> 39:29.110
No problem.

39:33.489 --> 39:34.824
Look.

39:42.415 --> 39:43.416
Hey, Coop.

39:44.500 --> 39:46.001
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

39:47.211 --> 39:48.295
I think that we would like

39:48.337 --> 39:49.422
to ask you the same question.

39:49.463 --> 39:50.798
Let me see your wallet.

39:52.216 --> 39:53.801
Show him your wallet, Dan.

39:55.720 --> 39:57.388
I don't... I don't know what's going on.

40:02.393 --> 40:04.145
Your name's not Tim Speedle.

40:04.186 --> 40:06.689
Eric, listen to me, okay?
It's not what you think.

40:06.731 --> 40:08.607
Your name is not Tim Speedle.

40:14.488 --> 40:15.072
You know what,

40:15.114 --> 40:16.574
I would ask you for an explanation,

40:16.615 --> 40:17.992
but I just don't think I'd get one.

40:19.910 --> 40:22.413
You know I want to be a CSI.

40:23.497 --> 40:26.625
And you guys, you speak
so highly of the guy.

40:26.792 --> 40:28.919
I just thought I'd check
out Speedle's locker,

40:28.961 --> 40:30.921
see what he was all about and...

40:33.215 --> 40:36.010
I saw the credit card and it just...

40:36.052 --> 40:37.511
it's not like he'd miss it.

40:37.595 --> 40:38.804
Why'd you use it?

40:39.305 --> 40:41.390
There was $200 credit
on there. It was free...

40:41.432 --> 40:43.476
Dan... It's free money.

40:43.517 --> 40:45.478
You've charged over $2,300.

40:45.519 --> 40:47.688
I know, it got... it got out of hand.

40:47.730 --> 40:48.981
It's fraud.

40:49.023 --> 40:50.399
No, it was a mistake.

40:50.524 --> 40:52.026
Calleigh, it was a big mistake.

40:52.068 --> 40:53.694
It won't happen again.

40:53.736 --> 40:55.279
I know. It's over.

40:55.321 --> 40:56.280
Wait, what are you saying?

40:56.322 --> 40:58.699
The-The lab, they gave
Ryan another chance.

40:58.741 --> 41:00.576
Ryan broke protocol.

41:00.618 --> 41:02.411
You have broken the law.

41:02.620 --> 41:04.497
But Calleigh, Speedle's dead.

41:05.790 --> 41:08.709
I mean, no one got hurt.

41:10.127 --> 41:12.004
You don't think Eric got hurt?

41:12.713 --> 41:14.298
You don't think I'm hurt?

41:15.299 --> 41:18.094
What about the people that
Speedle gave his life for?

41:19.220 --> 41:20.471
You have until tomorrow
morning to turn yourself in.

41:20.513 --> 41:23.224
After that, I'm going to put
out a warrant for your arrest.

42:08.102 --> 42:09.395
Eric.

42:14.191 --> 42:15.401
Took your advice.

42:15.609 --> 42:16.819
I went to go see someone.

42:17.319 --> 42:18.696
What'd he tell you?

42:19.405 --> 42:21.907
That I'm having
transitory hallucinations.

42:22.116 --> 42:24.160
Brain's building new pathways

42:24.201 --> 42:26.287
around the fragment
that's still in there.

42:26.412 --> 42:27.455
Chemistry's all shook up.

42:27.496 --> 42:29.790
And that your condition
would be ongoing.

42:30.291 --> 42:32.501
Yeah, as long as the
fragment's still in there.

42:33.502 --> 42:34.920
He gave me some medication.

42:35.421 --> 42:36.714
I should be okay.

42:37.923 --> 42:39.800
Eric, come to me next time.

42:40.301 --> 42:41.093
Okay?

42:42.094 --> 42:43.095
I will.

42:54.398 --> 42:55.816
It's just, uh...

42:56.692 --> 42:58.194
I thought Speedle was back.

43:00.905 --> 43:02.907
Now I'm saying good-bye all over again.

43:03.199 --> 43:04.992
Never gets any easier, does it?

43:06.494 --> 43:07.328
No.

43:13.793 --> 43:15.211
You ever see him, H?

43:16.504 --> 43:17.588
Every day.

43:19.799 --> 43:21.008
Every day.
