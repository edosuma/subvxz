00:11.011 --> 00:15.882
MARTIN (over radio):
Rappy Rirfday, Rasier.

00:20.687 --> 00:24.424
Why, Eddie, you can talk.

00:24.424 --> 00:27.227
I've always been
able to talk.

00:27.227 --> 00:29.696
I just save it
for special occasions

00:29.696 --> 00:32.698
like somebody's rirfday.

00:32.698 --> 00:34.200
Yes, yes, Eddie,
thank you very much.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.202
But listen, I'd like
to talk about Dad.

00:36.202 --> 00:39.139
I think his mind
may be slipping.

00:39.139 --> 00:41.174
Hey, don't say stuff
like that to him.

00:41.174 --> 00:42.675
He's a dog-- he might
not know you're joking.

00:43.176 --> 00:45.178
Why, Dad, I didn't even
know you were here.

00:45.178 --> 00:47.147
(chuckles):
 Yes.

00:47.147 --> 00:48.581
Well, just give me
a couple more minutes

00:48.581 --> 00:50.617
and I'll have your birthday
breakfast all ready.

00:50.617 --> 00:51.885
Come on, Eddie.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.788
Right behind you.

00:59.426 --> 01:02.328
Oh, well,
that's very nice, Dad.

01:02.328 --> 01:03.196
Yes.

01:03.196 --> 01:04.563
Oh, and look what I got.

01:04.563 --> 01:06.900
A newspaper from the day
you were born.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.301
I keep telling you
to clean out

01:08.301 --> 01:09.803
that closet of yours.

01:09.803 --> 01:10.804
I ordered it.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.806
Yes, well,
let's just see

01:12.806 --> 01:16.276
what other wonders
occurred on that day.

01:16.276 --> 01:18.278
(chuckles)

01:18.278 --> 01:23.650
"Suspected pinko ousted
from crossing guard post."

01:23.650 --> 01:26.986
What a jolly world
I was born in to.

01:26.986 --> 01:28.488
Now, I know tonight's
your party...

01:28.488 --> 01:29.489
Oh...

01:29.989 --> 01:30.990
...but here.

01:30.990 --> 01:32.459
Happy Birthday.

01:32.459 --> 01:34.260
Make a wish.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.028
Dad, thank you.

01:35.528 --> 01:37.831
(both chuckling)

01:37.831 --> 01:39.132
What's the matter?

01:39.132 --> 01:40.600
My back...

01:40.600 --> 01:42.102
Oh.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.603
...it's completely
seized up.

01:43.603 --> 01:44.604
Oh, okay.
Well, come on.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.106
Now just take it easy.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.107
There you go.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.108
Real slow.
I-I...

01:48.108 --> 01:50.043
There you go.
(grunts)

01:50.043 --> 01:51.010
Oh, my God.

01:51.511 --> 01:53.012
It's been
a little tender lately.

01:53.012 --> 01:55.014
I-I went to see
the doctor last week.

01:55.014 --> 01:57.383
He told me there was absolutely
nothing wrong with it.

01:57.383 --> 01:58.718
Doctors never tell you anything.

01:58.718 --> 02:00.120
They're just a bunch
of overpaid quacks.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.888
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:01.888 --> 02:02.755
I don't mean you.

02:02.755 --> 02:05.225
I mean, I'm talking
about real doctors.

02:06.159 --> 02:07.660
How could this be
happening to me?

02:07.660 --> 02:10.163
I'm always so conscientious
about back safety.

02:10.163 --> 02:11.164
Why, just the other day,

02:11.164 --> 02:13.166
you know, when I needed
that large, heavy stack of books

02:13.166 --> 02:14.667
from down in the storage room

02:14.667 --> 02:16.669
I insisted that Daphne
make three trips.

02:16.669 --> 02:18.438
Well, you know what,

02:18.438 --> 02:20.707
I've got that old
girdle in my bedroom.

02:20.707 --> 02:21.708
Let me go get it.

02:21.708 --> 02:23.042
That should do it.
Dad, please.

02:23.042 --> 02:24.844
I'm not wearing anything
called a girdle.

02:24.844 --> 02:27.213
What if I called it
a back brace?

02:27.213 --> 02:28.948
Get it!

02:31.751 --> 02:34.154
(doorbell rings)

02:38.358 --> 02:40.693
Daphne?

02:40.693 --> 02:43.062
(doorbell rings)

02:43.062 --> 02:44.564
Good God!

02:48.067 --> 02:51.538
Coming!

02:51.538 --> 02:52.472
Oh!

02:54.407 --> 02:57.911
This wouldn't be taking me
so long

02:57.911 --> 03:00.813
if my housekeeper were here.

03:03.816 --> 03:06.052
I'm a physical therapist.

03:06.052 --> 03:08.321
Perhaps you could get me
into a chair.

03:08.321 --> 03:09.255
Oh, goodness!

03:09.255 --> 03:10.757
Is your back
bothering you again?

03:10.757 --> 03:11.758
Thank you.
Thank you, Daph.

03:11.758 --> 03:12.759
Oh, I'm sorry
I made you get up.

03:12.759 --> 03:14.260
I forgot my key.

03:14.260 --> 03:15.261
You know, perhaps
you should get

03:15.261 --> 03:16.763
a spare set made just
to keep at Donny's.

03:16.763 --> 03:18.765
For God's sake, you're practically
living there as it is.

03:18.765 --> 03:21.267
Oh, now, Dr. Crane, you
better get used to it.

03:21.267 --> 03:23.269
Once I'm married, I
will be living there.

03:23.269 --> 03:24.771
I know what'll
help that back;

03:24.771 --> 03:25.772
a nice massage.

03:25.772 --> 03:26.739
Here you go.

03:26.739 --> 03:28.074
Oh, the girdle.

03:28.074 --> 03:29.642
That'll help.

03:29.642 --> 03:30.877
Now, listen,

03:30.877 --> 03:32.378
it's kind of hard
to put on by yourself,

03:32.378 --> 03:34.380
but if Daphne holds one end
and I hold the other

03:34.380 --> 03:36.382
you can kind of spin
into it.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.251
Please, Dad, this is
humiliating enough as it is.

03:38.251 --> 03:39.652
What's humiliating about it?

03:39.652 --> 03:40.653
Now, you just hook it
in the back, like a bra.

03:40.653 --> 03:42.655
Just give me that!

03:45.425 --> 03:49.596
Mr. Crane, does it bother you
when I stay over at Donny's?

03:49.596 --> 03:50.830
No.

03:50.830 --> 03:52.599
Well, it seems
to bother Dr. Crane.

03:52.599 --> 03:54.901
Oh, he's just cranky
because of his back.

03:54.901 --> 03:55.902
Good Lord!

03:55.902 --> 03:58.271
Queen Elizabeth
had another baby.

03:59.939 --> 04:01.741
I don't care
what science can do.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.209
It's just not right.

04:09.382 --> 04:12.151
Yes. Oh, that'll be
just fine right there.

04:12.151 --> 04:14.921
Be sure to thank the gang
for the flowers, Connie.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.923
You're welcome,
Dr. Crane.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.291
Happy Birthday.

04:18.291 --> 04:19.591
Birthday?

04:21.427 --> 04:23.129
Happy Birthday, Frasier.

04:23.129 --> 04:24.464
Thank you, Roz.

04:24.464 --> 04:27.967
It's not off
to the best start, though.

04:27.967 --> 04:29.769
My back is out.

04:29.769 --> 04:30.503
Why don't you go home?

04:30.503 --> 04:32.038
We'll just air
The Best of Crane.

04:32.038 --> 04:33.306
I'll drop your gift by later.

04:33.306 --> 04:34.607
No, no, Roz.

04:34.607 --> 04:35.608
Couldn't do that.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.110
I promised my listeners

04:37.110 --> 04:39.612
that I'd read
a birthday address.

04:39.612 --> 04:42.115
Well, uh, people might
have forgotten.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.617
People do have busy
lives, you know?

04:44.617 --> 04:46.619
No, Roz,
I announced it twice.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.621
Anyone paying even
the slightest attention

04:48.621 --> 04:49.922
would know.

04:49.922 --> 04:52.525
Say, what are you
doing over there?

04:52.525 --> 04:56.696
Just, uh, wondering
when to surprise you

04:56.696 --> 04:58.364
with your present!

04:58.364 --> 05:00.166
Oh, Roz. Oh...

05:00.166 --> 05:01.567
Guess now is as good
a time as any.

05:01.567 --> 05:03.069
You know, we keep
promising each other

05:03.069 --> 05:04.070
we're not going
to do this.

05:04.070 --> 05:06.072
We have to stop
spoiling one another.

05:06.072 --> 05:07.073
What am I
supposed to do,

05:07.073 --> 05:08.574
just forget
your birthday?

05:08.574 --> 05:09.575
Oh...

05:09.575 --> 05:11.077
Oh, good Lord, Roz.

05:11.077 --> 05:12.078
You know, I read

05:12.078 --> 05:14.580
the most wonderful review
of this recently.

05:14.580 --> 05:15.581
I hope you like it.

05:15.581 --> 05:17.583
Oh, look,
you've inscribed it.

05:17.583 --> 05:19.552
I did?

05:19.552 --> 05:22.522
"You'll always be my baby."

05:22.522 --> 05:25.458
I must have had a glass of wine
when I wrote that.

05:25.458 --> 05:26.459
Mm-hmm.

05:26.959 --> 05:28.461
"Love, Mom."

05:31.264 --> 05:34.167
Well, there's our bent
and broken birthday boy.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.168
Hi, Niles.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.136
I brought you
a little gift.

05:37.136 --> 05:38.938
Say hello
to sweet salvation--

05:38.938 --> 05:41.307
the lumbar log.

05:41.307 --> 05:42.308
Oh, thank you, Niles.

05:42.809 --> 05:43.676
Yes, yes.
You're welcome.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.579
I think the whole thing is
probably stress-related.

05:46.579 --> 05:48.081
Well, that's very possible.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.883
You know, birthdays
can be anxiety-provoking,

05:50.883 --> 05:54.187
especially for people
of a certain age.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.155
I am not of a certain age,
Niles.

05:56.155 --> 05:58.624
I am smack-dab in the middle
of "not a kid anymore."

05:58.624 --> 06:00.560
I won't be of a certain age
for another ten years.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.962
You know, if your back
pain is stress-related,

06:02.962 --> 06:04.464
I read a magazine
article

06:04.464 --> 06:06.332
with an exercise
that might help.

06:06.332 --> 06:08.701
You just go someplace
where nobody can hear you

06:08.701 --> 06:10.670
and list all the things
that bug you.

06:10.670 --> 06:12.105
And in what
esteemed medical journal

06:12.105 --> 06:14.974
did you find
this little tidbit, Cosmo?

06:16.142 --> 06:17.910
No. Glamour.

06:17.910 --> 06:20.646
Oh, that's priceless.

06:20.646 --> 06:22.415
"I can't find
he right shade of lipstick.

06:22.415 --> 06:23.916
"I look terrible in a bikini.

06:23.916 --> 06:26.686
He can't find my G-spot."

06:28.354 --> 06:30.656
I said do it someplace private.

06:31.524 --> 06:33.025
You know, it couldn't hurt,
Frasier.

06:33.025 --> 06:34.527
Oh, Niles,
it's absurd.

06:34.527 --> 06:35.862
Hmm. The more you resist

06:35.862 --> 06:38.131
the more I'm wondering
if there's something

06:38.131 --> 06:39.465
you're trying to avoid.

06:40.600 --> 06:41.934
Thanks for backing
me up, Niles.

06:41.934 --> 06:43.436
You know,
the same article said,

06:43.436 --> 06:44.904
"If you rub
a raw potato..."

06:44.904 --> 06:47.306
if we're to sell him on this,
you should drop out now.

06:48.608 --> 06:50.476
No one's going to
sell me on anything.

06:50.476 --> 06:51.978
That sort of exercise
only helps people

06:51.978 --> 06:53.479
that lack self-awareness.

06:53.479 --> 06:55.481
I, for one, am...

06:55.982 --> 06:57.850
God Almighty!

06:57.850 --> 06:59.685
Well, no wonder
you're stressed.

06:59.685 --> 07:02.121
You've got
a whole universe to run.

07:03.923 --> 07:04.791
30 seconds, Frasier.

07:04.791 --> 07:06.092
All right.
I'm going to be off.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.794
You take care of yourself.
I'll see you tonight.

07:07.794 --> 07:08.628
All right.

07:08.628 --> 07:09.695
Are you sure you're
up to this?

07:09.695 --> 07:11.697
Oh, I'll be fine, Roz.

07:11.697 --> 07:13.699
I'm not as delicate as all that.

07:13.699 --> 07:14.667
How'd you do
it, anyway?

07:14.667 --> 07:16.936
Blowing out a cupcake.

07:20.039 --> 07:20.807
You know, Frasier,

07:20.807 --> 07:23.209
we can always put
in a Best of Crane.

07:23.209 --> 07:24.143
No, no, Roz.

07:24.143 --> 07:26.446
Now just have
a little bit of faith in me.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.814
I'm a lot tougher
than that.

07:27.814 --> 07:29.282
I tell you what.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.751
If I feel like I need help
toward the end of the show,

07:31.751 --> 07:34.720
I'll give you
a little signal, all right?

07:34.720 --> 07:36.189
All right.
Five seconds.

07:36.189 --> 07:37.690
(inhales deeply)

07:37.690 --> 07:41.627
Gosh, you know these flowers
really are beautiful.

07:41.627 --> 07:45.031
Good afternoon, Seattle.

07:45.031 --> 07:46.032
(sneezes)

07:46.032 --> 07:47.033
(cries out)

07:47.033 --> 07:48.000
(sneezes)

07:48.000 --> 07:49.702
(cries out)

07:49.702 --> 07:50.970
(sneezes, cries out)

07:57.243 --> 08:00.313
(Frasier groaning)

08:00.313 --> 08:02.815
Hello? Anyone here?

08:05.117 --> 08:06.619
I guess they're all out.

08:06.619 --> 08:08.488
Okay. Well,
let's just get you settled.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.889
Niles, Niles, slow down.

08:09.889 --> 08:11.390
For God's sakes,

08:11.390 --> 08:12.892
we're not running
a three-legged race.

08:12.892 --> 08:14.393
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Oh, oh, oh. Ow. Okay.

08:14.393 --> 08:16.362
Do you have somewhere to be?

08:16.362 --> 08:17.830
Well, since you
bring it up,

08:17.830 --> 08:19.332
I do actually have a luncheon
with my new lady love.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.833
Oh, well, gosh,
I'd hate to let

08:20.833 --> 08:22.335
my pain stand in
the way of that.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.836
How could that
orthopedist of yours

08:23.836 --> 08:25.338
tell me there was
nothing wrong?

08:25.338 --> 08:26.839
Frasier, I looked
at the X rays myself.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.274
This is not
a skeletal problem.

08:28.274 --> 08:29.675
All right, there.
Now, you're all fine,

08:29.675 --> 08:31.177
and I'm sure
Dad will be by soon.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.945
No, wait.

08:32.945 --> 08:35.715
This couch has
absolutely no support.

08:35.715 --> 08:38.650
Let's try the chair
over there, please?

08:38.650 --> 08:40.086
All right.

08:40.086 --> 08:41.554
You're not heavy.

08:41.554 --> 08:43.589
You're my brother.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.993
Ow! Ow!

08:46.993 --> 08:48.995
God, how could you even take me
to that unprofessional hack?

08:48.995 --> 08:51.497
All he did was give me a bottle
full of horse tranquilizers.

08:51.497 --> 08:53.499
He didn't care about getting
to the root of the problem.

08:53.499 --> 08:55.501
He just wanted to shut me up.

08:55.501 --> 09:00.006
I think it might be time
for one of those pills.

09:02.508 --> 09:04.010
(groans)

09:04.010 --> 09:06.012
All comfy?

09:07.780 --> 09:09.549
Niles, uh, this won't do.

09:10.082 --> 09:12.485
It's even harder than
a seat on a public bus.

09:12.485 --> 09:15.187
Oh, when were you
ever on a bus?

09:15.187 --> 09:18.324
At a cocktail party once,
for "The Friends of Transit."

09:18.324 --> 09:20.593
I wasn't invited
to that.

09:20.593 --> 09:22.895
Will you just help me up,
for God's sake?!

09:22.895 --> 09:24.330
All right, all right.
Hold on, hold on.

09:24.330 --> 09:25.831
Ow. Oh. Ow.
Okay?

09:25.831 --> 09:27.333
Ow. Ow. Ow.
Shh, shh.

09:27.333 --> 09:28.834
Ow, God, you know,

09:28.834 --> 09:30.836
maybe I should take
another one of those pills.

09:30.836 --> 09:32.171
All right.
All right.

09:32.171 --> 09:33.506
I'll get you
a glass of water, okay?

09:33.506 --> 09:35.007
All right.
Let go, let go.

09:35.007 --> 09:38.511
You know, things really
are going well with Mel.

09:38.511 --> 09:40.980
I've been out with her
almost every night.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.515
I don't want
to jinx things,

09:42.515 --> 09:44.016
but I daresay we're
well on our way

09:44.016 --> 09:48.521
to becoming what might
almost pass for an item.

09:51.023 --> 09:52.525
(grunts)

09:52.525 --> 09:53.993
I mean it, Frasier,

09:53.993 --> 09:55.962
she was just the...

09:59.165 --> 10:00.633
Oh, my God!

10:00.633 --> 10:02.134
Did you fall?

10:02.134 --> 10:03.135
No.

10:03.135 --> 10:06.405
No, I'm actually
quite comfortable, Niles.

10:06.405 --> 10:07.707
Look...

10:07.707 --> 10:10.543
there's no glare
on the television

10:10.543 --> 10:14.780
and here's a lovely place
to set your drink.

10:14.780 --> 10:15.615
Just give me your hand

10:16.115 --> 10:18.117
and whatever the chair's
telling you, don't listen.

10:18.117 --> 10:19.018
No, Niles, no.

10:19.018 --> 10:21.354
It's helping my back,
actually, you know,

10:21.354 --> 10:24.790
and when you sit in it,
you don't have to look at it.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.058
(chuckling)

10:26.058 --> 10:27.460
If you're really
interested

10:27.460 --> 10:29.462
in correcting this problem
and not just medicating it,

10:29.462 --> 10:31.464
you should consider that
technique Roz mentioned--

10:31.464 --> 10:32.732
listing your
problems aloud.

10:32.732 --> 10:34.066
Oh, give me a break.

10:34.066 --> 10:35.501
Well, it's perfectly possible

10:35.501 --> 10:37.870
this is connected
to some submerged anxiety.

10:37.870 --> 10:38.738
What's bothering you?

10:38.738 --> 10:39.739
Oh, yes, Niles.

10:39.739 --> 10:41.240
Do you really expect me

10:41.240 --> 10:42.241
to sit here all alone
in this apartment

10:42.241 --> 10:43.743
prattling on endlessly
about my problems

10:43.743 --> 10:45.111
like some sort
of a lunatic?

10:45.111 --> 10:46.479
If you think
I'm going to do that,

10:46.479 --> 10:49.815
you're the one that needs
to get his head examined.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.654
Oh, oh, good God!

10:54.654 --> 10:55.655
Oh, Eddie.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.156
Please, just shoo.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.158
Get off of me,
get off of me.

10:59.158 --> 11:01.160
(sighing)

11:06.499 --> 11:08.467
What?

11:08.467 --> 11:10.236
Oh, do you
want to know

11:10.236 --> 11:11.937
what's bothering me, too?

11:11.937 --> 11:13.739
All right, well,
here's a start.

11:13.739 --> 11:18.110
I'm talking to a dog--
that bothers me.

11:18.110 --> 11:19.612
I'm another year older today.

11:19.612 --> 11:21.447
I suppose that bothers me.

11:21.447 --> 11:24.283
(whimpers)

11:24.283 --> 11:26.786
Though not as much as
people seem to think.

11:26.786 --> 11:28.788
(sighs)

11:31.257 --> 11:33.192
I'm still single.

11:33.192 --> 11:36.696
That's a big one...

11:36.696 --> 11:40.700
not having a woman
to share my life with.

11:40.700 --> 11:44.637
The only women in my life
are friends-- Roz and Daphne.

11:44.637 --> 11:46.572
Daphne's not even
here anymore.

11:46.572 --> 11:48.074
She'll be married soon.

11:48.074 --> 11:50.509
That's going to
be tough on Dad.

11:50.509 --> 11:52.945
Who am I kidding?

11:52.945 --> 11:56.449
It's going to be tough on me.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.785
It's been nice having her here.

11:59.785 --> 12:01.987
Even when my love life
isn't going so well,

12:01.987 --> 12:06.726
I can always come home to a...
a warm and considerate woman.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.594
You know, that's-
that's probably why

12:08.594 --> 12:11.397
I've been so brusque
with her lately.

12:11.397 --> 12:14.233
I know that once she's gone...

12:14.233 --> 12:17.236
I'll probably be
twice as lonely.

12:19.205 --> 12:21.240
Well...

12:21.240 --> 12:23.442
it's quite a realization,
isn't it?

12:23.442 --> 12:26.645
I really do
love Daphne...

12:29.915 --> 12:33.886
...and, now,
I'm about to lose her.

12:33.886 --> 12:35.888
I've got to show her
how I feel about her

12:35.888 --> 12:37.790
while I still have a chance.

12:43.095 --> 12:44.597
Well, I don't know

12:44.597 --> 12:47.099
if it was the therapy
or the-the painkillers,

12:47.099 --> 12:49.602
but I actually feel
a bit better.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.603
Let's try this.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.104
(grunts)

12:52.104 --> 12:53.105
Ah...

12:53.105 --> 12:53.939
(chuckles)

12:57.143 --> 12:59.145
You know, there are subtler ways

12:59.145 --> 13:00.913
to let the patient know
his hour is up.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.182
(door closing)

13:03.182 --> 13:04.583
DAPHNE:
Oh!

13:04.583 --> 13:07.319
Dr. Crane,
I didn't know you were here.

13:07.319 --> 13:08.454
Daphne.
Can't hear anything

13:08.454 --> 13:09.822
in that shower of mine.

13:09.822 --> 13:12.124
It's like a
soundproof vault.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.893
Daphne, I-I wanted to apologize

13:13.893 --> 13:16.695
for being so short
with you this morning.

13:16.695 --> 13:17.496
Oh, it's fine.

13:17.496 --> 13:18.764
No, it's not.

13:18.764 --> 13:20.032
It's never fine.

13:20.032 --> 13:21.801
Listen, come here, please.

13:29.074 --> 13:30.075
Give me a hug.

13:32.511 --> 13:33.913
Oh, Daphne...

13:33.913 --> 13:36.081
do you know how much
you mean to me?

13:36.081 --> 13:37.983
I'm getting an idea.

13:42.688 --> 13:44.657
(door opening)

13:45.558 --> 13:46.826
Hey, Daph.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.928
(door closes)

13:48.928 --> 13:50.262
What's wrong?

13:50.262 --> 13:51.197
You all right?

13:51.197 --> 13:53.132
Well, actually, no.

13:53.132 --> 13:57.136
I overheard something
I wasn't supposed to hear.

13:57.136 --> 14:00.072
It's about
Dr. Crane.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.043
I overhead him say
he's in love with me.

14:04.043 --> 14:05.544
What?

14:05.544 --> 14:08.047
Yeah, and he wants to show
me how much he loves me

14:08.047 --> 14:09.415
while he still
has the chance.

14:09.415 --> 14:11.684
Oh, geez, not this.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.385
You knew about this?

14:13.385 --> 14:15.054
I'm not getting
in the middle of this.

14:15.054 --> 14:16.288
Then it's true.

14:16.288 --> 14:17.790
Look, I kept my mouth shut
for six years.

14:18.290 --> 14:20.226
I'm not saying
anything now.

14:20.226 --> 14:21.794
Six years?!

14:21.794 --> 14:23.796
He's felt this way
for six years?

14:23.796 --> 14:25.231
You didn't hear that from me.

14:27.233 --> 14:27.733
Daphne...

14:28.234 --> 14:32.071
Daphne, I...
can't lower myself into the tub.

14:32.071 --> 14:34.306
Well, don't look at me.

14:34.306 --> 14:35.741
No, I thought I'd skip the bath

14:35.741 --> 14:37.743
and take you up
on that massage you offered.

14:37.743 --> 14:39.245
Those expert hands of yours

14:39.245 --> 14:41.747
might be
just what the doctor ordered.

14:41.747 --> 14:44.149
Let's do it in my bedroom,
shall we?

14:46.000 --> 14:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:53.559 --> 14:54.560
Oh.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.494
What kept you?

14:55.494 --> 14:56.462
Daphne, here,

14:56.462 --> 14:58.397
just help me
out of this robe, please.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.766
I nearly killed myself
putting it on.

15:00.766 --> 15:02.635
(sighing)

15:05.671 --> 15:07.172
(sighs)

15:09.642 --> 15:11.176
All right.

15:11.176 --> 15:14.013
(sighs)

15:15.247 --> 15:16.749
Here we go.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.187
Now...

15:22.187 --> 15:26.659
remember, your
back's very tender.

15:26.659 --> 15:29.662
So... no sudden
movements.

15:29.662 --> 15:30.963
(grunts)

15:37.303 --> 15:38.304
(groans ecstatically)

15:38.304 --> 15:39.805
Oh.

15:41.307 --> 15:44.209
You know, I'm catching a draft
in this robe.

15:44.209 --> 15:46.145
Perhaps I better change.

15:46.145 --> 15:47.646
I'll be waiting.

15:54.153 --> 15:55.354
Hey, Fras...

15:55.354 --> 15:56.622
Yes, Dad?

15:56.622 --> 15:57.990
Did Daphne tell you?

15:57.990 --> 15:58.991
Tell me what?

15:58.991 --> 16:01.393
She found out Niles
has a thing for her.

16:01.393 --> 16:03.162
What?
Yes. How?

16:03.162 --> 16:05.064
Well, she said
she overheard him earlier

16:05.064 --> 16:06.065
saying how much he loves her.

16:06.065 --> 16:07.066
Oh, dear God.

16:07.066 --> 16:09.068
No wonder
she's been so distracted.

16:09.068 --> 16:10.536
And what did you say?

16:10.536 --> 16:11.570
Did you confirm it?

16:11.570 --> 16:13.439
Well, yes, I said
I knew about it.

16:13.439 --> 16:14.273
Oh, Dad...

16:14.273 --> 16:15.741
Well, come on, what else
was I going to say?

16:15.741 --> 16:17.209
Then I told her it was
none of my business,

16:17.209 --> 16:19.044
and I took off out of there.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.914
Wait a minute.

16:21.914 --> 16:24.917
How did she even
see Niles today?

16:24.917 --> 16:26.418
I don't know, but she said

16:26.418 --> 16:27.920
she overheard him
saying he loves her

16:27.920 --> 16:30.389
and that he wanted to tell her
while he still has a chance.

16:31.357 --> 16:32.858
Oh, no.

16:32.858 --> 16:34.827
What?

16:34.827 --> 16:36.161
I said that.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.563
Oh, not you now.

16:37.563 --> 16:40.399
No, no, no, Dad,
not that.

16:40.399 --> 16:42.735
I was just doing a little
exercise to try to help my back,

16:42.735 --> 16:44.236
and I was talking out loud

16:44.236 --> 16:45.738
about how much I was going
to miss Daphne.

16:45.738 --> 16:48.574
She must have overheard me
and misunderstood.

16:48.574 --> 16:50.242
Who were you talking to?

16:54.580 --> 16:57.483
If you must know,
I was talking to Eddie.

16:58.384 --> 17:00.319
Helps, doesn't it?

17:00.319 --> 17:03.222
Oh, stop it.

17:03.222 --> 17:04.223
Thanks to you,

17:04.223 --> 17:06.191
now Daphne thinks
I'm in love with her,

17:06.191 --> 17:08.127
and here I am
asking her for a massage.

17:08.127 --> 17:10.061
How is she expected
to interpret that?

17:11.964 --> 17:13.464
Hard to say.

17:13.464 --> 17:14.465
Huh?

17:14.465 --> 17:15.968
Oh, boy.

17:15.968 --> 17:17.970
Just take a deep breath
and try to relax.

17:17.970 --> 17:18.971
Daphne...

17:18.971 --> 17:20.973
Let's both do that, shall we?

17:20.973 --> 17:21.874
Daphne...

17:21.874 --> 17:23.809
Dad told me
that you overheard me.

17:23.809 --> 17:24.810
He did?

17:24.810 --> 17:26.045
Yes.

17:26.045 --> 17:26.878
Well, I certainly picked

17:27.378 --> 17:28.380
the wrong person to confide in.

17:28.380 --> 17:29.648
No, no, no.

17:29.648 --> 17:30.949
I-I'm glad he told me

17:30.949 --> 17:33.952
because the truth is
you misunderstood.

17:33.952 --> 17:36.955
You see, when I said
how much I cared about you,

17:36.955 --> 17:39.425
I didn't mean it
in a romantic sense.

17:39.425 --> 17:41.727
Then you don't love me?

17:41.727 --> 17:44.096
Oh, no, of course,
I love you, Daphne,

17:44.096 --> 17:46.432
but... as a friend, that's all.

17:46.432 --> 17:47.232
Oh...

17:47.232 --> 17:48.567
Oh, thank God!

17:48.567 --> 17:50.869
Oh, what a relief!

17:50.869 --> 17:53.338
I mean, I was flattered, but,
oh... yes, yes, all right.

17:53.338 --> 17:54.740
All right, okay,
fine, fine, Daphne.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.241
That's fine. Off you go.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.242
Go ahead.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.744
Oh...

17:58.744 --> 18:00.245
Oh, my, my head.

18:00.245 --> 18:01.680
Oh, it must be
those pills.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.682
Come on, let me give
you that massage

18:03.682 --> 18:05.184
while you can
still feel it.

18:05.184 --> 18:06.185
All right.

18:06.185 --> 18:07.186
Come on, then.

18:07.186 --> 18:08.687
Well...

18:08.687 --> 18:11.190
(sighing and chuckling)

18:11.190 --> 18:12.191
Oh, dear...

18:12.191 --> 18:15.627
(sighing and moaning)

18:15.627 --> 18:16.562
You know, Daph,

18:16.562 --> 18:19.431
we really are going
to miss you around here.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.300
Oh, it's going to be hard
for me, too.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.235
It's something
I haven't even wanted

18:23.235 --> 18:24.736
to think about, leaving.

18:24.736 --> 18:28.107
I know I grumble
a bit, but...

18:28.107 --> 18:32.478
I do love you
and your father.

18:32.478 --> 18:33.979
I'll still come
around, though.

18:33.979 --> 18:36.482
We'll all see
each other.

18:36.482 --> 18:37.483
You know what?

18:37.483 --> 18:39.318
What's that,
Dr. Crane?

18:39.318 --> 18:41.019
Dad's chair.

18:41.019 --> 18:45.824
I'm not taking it with me,
if that's where you're headed.

18:45.824 --> 18:48.594
It felt comfortable.

18:48.594 --> 18:52.364
You took quite a few of
those pills, didn't you?

18:53.599 --> 18:55.467
You know what's curious, though?

18:56.401 --> 18:57.836
Cats?

19:00.239 --> 19:01.240
Yes...

19:01.740 --> 19:04.243
(chuckles)

19:04.743 --> 19:07.646
But I'm talking about
our little mix-up.

19:07.646 --> 19:12.017
When I said to your father,
"Dr. Crane's in love with me,"

19:12.017 --> 19:15.053
he said it's been going on
for six years now.

19:15.053 --> 19:16.989
What did he mean by that?

19:16.989 --> 19:18.924
Oh, that.

19:18.924 --> 19:21.827
He meant Niles.

19:23.762 --> 19:25.063
What?

19:25.063 --> 19:26.365
Niles.

19:26.365 --> 19:28.901
He's crazy about you.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.672
Dr. Crane?

19:35.574 --> 19:36.975
Dr. Crane...

19:42.748 --> 19:45.651
MARTIN (over radio):
Come on, rirfday boy.

19:45.651 --> 19:46.952
Wakey, wakey.

19:46.952 --> 19:49.454
Time for cakey.

19:49.454 --> 19:51.456
Dear God,

19:51.456 --> 19:54.459
has a year passed already?

19:54.459 --> 19:55.794
(barks)

19:55.794 --> 19:57.996
Please, the elastic's pinching
behind my ears.

19:57.996 --> 20:00.365
Oh, come on, it's just
for a couple of hours.

20:00.365 --> 20:01.366
But it's pulling my hair.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.368
Well, you don't hear Eddie
complaining, do you?

20:03.368 --> 20:06.371
I ruv my hat.

20:06.371 --> 20:07.873
You know, I'm this close

20:07.873 --> 20:10.375
to breaking that thing
into a million pieces.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.377
Well, isn't this festive?

20:12.377 --> 20:13.879
Oh, Daphne,
by the way,

20:13.879 --> 20:15.347
thank you for the massage.

20:15.347 --> 20:16.381
I think it did
just the trick.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.382
Anytime, Dr. Crane.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.650
Listen, uh...

20:18.650 --> 20:20.719
just before
I drifted off,

20:20.719 --> 20:21.987
I-I'm afraid
I might have said something

20:21.987 --> 20:23.855
I wish I hadn't.

20:23.855 --> 20:26.024
Yes?

20:26.024 --> 20:28.727
It's about Dad's chair.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.562
I mean,
it may be comfortable,

20:30.562 --> 20:32.998
but I still want
to get it out of here.

20:32.998 --> 20:34.900
Oh, that.
Right.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.301
Why?

20:36.301 --> 20:39.204
I didn't say anything else
I shouldn't have said, did I?

20:39.204 --> 20:42.107
Well, um...

20:42.107 --> 20:43.475
no.

20:43.475 --> 20:45.277
Ah.
No, no...

20:45.277 --> 20:46.345
and don't worry.

20:46.345 --> 20:47.779
Mum's the word.

20:47.779 --> 20:48.847
(doorbell rings)

20:48.847 --> 20:49.848
I'll get it.

20:49.848 --> 20:51.783
Thank you.

20:51.783 --> 20:53.352
You straighten
things out with Daphne?

20:53.352 --> 20:54.219
Yes, I did.

20:54.219 --> 20:55.587
Boy, that was a close one.

20:55.587 --> 20:56.989
I almost blew Niles' secret.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.357
In the future, will you try
to be more discreet?

20:58.357 --> 21:00.759
I can't pull your chestnuts
out of the fire every time.

21:00.759 --> 21:03.128
Good evening, Daphne.

21:03.128 --> 21:06.131
Dr. Crane.

21:06.131 --> 21:07.633
You look different somehow.

21:07.633 --> 21:10.502
Have you done something new
with your hair?

21:11.903 --> 21:12.904
Oh.

21:12.904 --> 21:13.739
Oh...

21:13.739 --> 21:14.673
That must be it.

21:14.673 --> 21:15.674
Well, hello.

21:15.674 --> 21:16.675
FRASIER:
Niles.

21:16.675 --> 21:18.176
NILES:
Feeling better?

21:18.176 --> 21:20.679
FRASIER: I'm feeling much
better, thank you.

21:20.679 --> 21:23.081
Oh, that must be
a present for me.
