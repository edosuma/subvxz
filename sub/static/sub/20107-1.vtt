02:42.000 --> 02:43.206
Son of a bitch!

03:52.080 --> 03:53.730
No, we can't touch the munis.

03:53.920 --> 03:56.411
We'll use them as collateral for
a leveraged equity position in Cisco.

03:57.680 --> 03:59.801
Then I want you to take everything out of
First National and move it over to Banyon.

03:59.960 --> 04:01.450
Wait, you mean Delaware?
I thought that was dead.

04:01.600 --> 04:02.601
That's resurrected.

04:02.720 --> 04:03.720
We need to clean up the
Reynolds account...

04:03.800 --> 04:05.768
in case those fucks at AML
decide to do their job.

04:05.920 --> 04:06.960
Are you sure about this?

04:07.040 --> 04:08.121
Nothing on email.

04:08.280 --> 04:09.850
Move everything back on Monday.

04:10.560 --> 04:11.561
You paying attention?

04:11.720 --> 04:12.926
Yeah, yeah, I am.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.684
- Tickets?
- I don't know if...

04:15.760 --> 04:17.569
I'm sending the numbers through now.

04:17.720 --> 04:18.959
What about Green?

04:19.120 --> 04:20.120
Uh, stall him. I don't give a shit.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.201
Call in sick if you have to.

04:21.399 --> 04:22.765
Business or pleasure?

04:22.920 --> 04:24.604
I don't know. I just...

04:24.760 --> 04:25.886
Seriously?

04:26.040 --> 04:27.644
Look, I don't know
if I feel comfortable...

04:27.800 --> 04:30.087
Josh! Josh! Stop being such a pussy.

04:30.240 --> 04:32.720
Just do what I tell you to do,
and call me when it's done.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.923
To my fellow members of the board.

04:58.240 --> 05:00.971
A man cannot unsee the truth.

05:01.120 --> 05:03.521
He cannot willingly return to darkness...

05:03.680 --> 05:06.650
or go blind once he has
the gift of sight...

05:07.760 --> 05:10.286
any more than he can be unborn.

05:13.520 --> 05:17.241
We are the only species
capable of self-reflection.

05:18.800 --> 05:21.800
The only species
with the toxin of self-doubt

05:21.880 --> 05:23.882
written into our genetic code.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.640
Unequal to our gifts, we build,

05:28.720 --> 05:31.644
we buy, we consume.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.404
We wrap ourselves in the illusion
of material success.

05:42.640 --> 05:45.484
We cheat and deceive as we claw our way...

05:45.640 --> 05:48.883
to the pinnacle of what
we define as achievement.

05:52.480 --> 05:55.484
Superiority to other men.

05:59.480 --> 06:01.005
Corner office.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.400
Who'd you have to blow?

06:02.560 --> 06:05.609
I heard he closed the Reynolds account.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.245
How exactly did you do that?

06:07.400 --> 06:08.606
Just that good, I guess.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.290
Don't forget about us little people.

06:10.640 --> 06:11.926
Oh, how could I?

06:12.640 --> 06:14.290
You know how I take my coffee.

06:15.240 --> 06:18.525
Excuse me, but they wanna see you
upstairs in the partners boardroom.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.970
Tell them I'll be right there.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.202
Oh, and tomorrow
is your mother's birthday.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.050
Get her something for me, would you?

06:26.200 --> 06:27.611
Of course.

06:29.320 --> 06:31.926
There is a sickness inside us.

06:33.480 --> 06:37.763
Rising like the bile that leaves that
bitter taste at the back of our throats.

06:43.280 --> 06:46.523
It's there in every one of you
seated around the table.

06:47.840 --> 06:52.203
We deny its existence until one day
the body rebels against the mind...

06:52.360 --> 06:53.760
and screams out,

06:53.840 --> 06:55.171
"I am not a well man."

06:57.960 --> 07:00.281
No doubt you will think
only of the merger.

07:01.680 --> 07:06.208
That unclean melding of two
equally diseased institutions.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.843
But the truth cannot be ignored.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.402
For only when we know what ails us
can we hope to find the cure.

07:15.240 --> 07:16.844
I will not return.

07:17.040 --> 07:19.088
Do not attempt to contact me again.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.402
Sincerely, Roland E. Pembroke.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.525
Well, Mr. Lockhart...

07:26.960 --> 07:28.849
what do you make of that?

07:30.760 --> 07:33.889
Clearly, he's lost his mind.

07:34.040 --> 07:35.451
Our thoughts exactly.

07:35.640 --> 07:39.769
Man goes for a two-week spa vacation,
and has a complete mental breakdown.

07:39.920 --> 07:43.561
Who the hell takes the waters
in the 21 st century anyway?

07:43.720 --> 07:46.246
I trust you understand the sensitivity

07:46.360 --> 07:48.522
of some of the information in that letter.

07:49.160 --> 07:50.605
So it's true.

07:51.080 --> 07:52.923
A merger of this kind will make us...

07:53.080 --> 07:56.171
one of the biggest financial service firms
on the Eastern Seaboard.

07:56.320 --> 07:58.926
Something that stands to
enrich everyone in this room.

07:59.120 --> 08:00.246
Including you.

08:00.400 --> 08:01.731
We hear good things.

08:01.880 --> 08:04.690
Your work on the Reynolds
account was inspired.

08:04.880 --> 08:07.240
Of course, the SEC will want

08:07.320 --> 08:09.891
unfettered access to our books.

08:10.040 --> 08:13.044
Any irregularities are sure to come out.

08:17.160 --> 08:19.606
You didn't really think
we wouldn't find out?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.809
I don't know what you're talking about.

08:26.480 --> 08:29.484
You think there's a trick
you can pull we haven't tried?

08:32.280 --> 08:33.486
This is amateur.

08:34.799 --> 08:36.722
Can I ask you something, Mr. Lockhart?

08:38.360 --> 08:41.727
You ever have a 12-inch
black dick in your ass?

08:43.600 --> 08:45.921
Prison, Mr. Lockhart.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.411
You're in a lot of trouble.

08:51.760 --> 08:55.282
If that were the case,
you would have already turned me in.

08:57.640 --> 09:01.809
So, my guess is the SEC
is after someone a little more senior.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.489
Someone on the board, perhaps.

09:12.480 --> 09:16.644
Or someone who's clearly unstable.

09:19.320 --> 09:23.288
We'd like you to go to Switzerland
and bring Mr. Pembroke back to us.

09:23.440 --> 09:24.487
You see...

09:24.840 --> 09:29.001
the merger cannot go through
without Mr. Pembroke signing off...

09:29.160 --> 09:32.960
on certain legal matters.

09:33.120 --> 09:35.771
I don't have the relationship
with Mr. Pembroke that Morris had.

09:35.920 --> 09:36.960
Fuck Morris.

09:37.040 --> 09:39.167
Now, Morris was a good salesman,
dependable family man.

09:39.280 --> 09:40.725
God rest his soul.

09:42.960 --> 09:44.086
But he didn't have vision.

09:45.240 --> 09:47.925
Someone has to take responsibility.

10:30.560 --> 10:32.005
Josh, it's me again.

10:32.160 --> 10:33.764
In an hour and a half, the Nikkei closes.

10:33.920 --> 10:36.047
When it does, I want you to empty
Banyon and buy puts in Glenco.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.400
I'm sending the details over now.

10:37.480 --> 10:38.527
And fucking call me back.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.682
I don't like leaving messages like this.

10:45.280 --> 10:47.044
You're here for the cure?

10:48.440 --> 10:50.249
No, I'm just visiting.

10:51.680 --> 10:52.761
You mind?

10:54.440 --> 10:55.441
Go ahead.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.448
You're younger than most of my passengers.

11:03.720 --> 11:05.882
Do a lot of driving for the sanitarium?

11:06.040 --> 11:07.326
All the driving.

11:07.520 --> 11:09.887
Every week, I pick up
rich people from the train...

11:10.040 --> 11:11.769
and take them up the mountain.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.922
Only rich people, huh?

11:14.080 --> 11:15.809
Must be expensive.

11:15.960 --> 11:18.361
Well, wealthy people
have wealthy problems.

11:18.520 --> 11:20.522
Me, I'm happy with a simple life.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.682
That's it? No ambition?

11:22.840 --> 11:24.888
Just drive people
up and down the mountain?

11:26.520 --> 11:28.204
Most people tend to stay.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.647
Why's that?

11:30.720 --> 11:32.085
I guess they like it there.

11:32.240 --> 11:33.241
Oh, shit.

11:34.280 --> 11:35.327
I don't go in for spas
and that kind of thing.

11:36.280 --> 11:39.204
I work for a living,
like my father before me.

11:39.360 --> 11:42.080
A son learns what it is to
be a man from his father.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.321
Am I right?

11:44.240 --> 11:45.446
I wouldn't know.

11:48.440 --> 11:50.681
I didn't grow up with my father.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.962
How long will you be gone?

11:54.120 --> 11:55.880
Just a few days. It's business.

11:57.080 --> 11:58.969
You don't look well.

11:59.800 --> 12:02.883
I'm fine. I just haven't been
sleeping much.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.883
You need to rest.

12:05.920 --> 12:08.605
You know, I always
told your father to rest...

12:10.560 --> 12:11.721
but he wouldn't listen.

12:11.880 --> 12:13.120
He was weak.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.126
You didn't know him.

12:15.280 --> 12:16.770
And whose fault is that?

12:23.080 --> 12:24.605
So, are you happy here?

12:24.800 --> 12:26.245
Are they taking good care of you?

12:26.400 --> 12:29.961
People come here to die.
Why would I be happy?

12:31.200 --> 12:33.043
I'm getting a promotion.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.291
So, when I get back

12:35.400 --> 12:37.129
I'll be able to move you
to somewhere better.

12:37.280 --> 12:39.328
Somewhere near the beach or something.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.360
You won't come back.

12:47.640 --> 12:49.130
Of course I will.

12:52.760 --> 12:54.205
Another ballerina?

12:55.320 --> 12:57.209
She's not like the others.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.646
Why's that?

12:59.840 --> 13:01.922
She lives in a dream.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.724
But she's dancing.

13:11.200 --> 13:14.682
That's because she doesn't
know she's dreaming.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.164
Friendly bunch.

13:38.480 --> 13:39.606
Yeah.

13:40.560 --> 13:42.360
There's always been bad blood

13:42.440 --> 13:44.920
between the villagers
and the people on the hill.

13:46.400 --> 13:47.401
Why's that?

13:51.080 --> 13:52.286
History.

14:23.240 --> 14:25.163
How old is this place?

14:25.320 --> 14:27.607
Foundations date back
to the time of the barons.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.367
For centuries, all this land
and everyone in it...

14:31.520 --> 14:33.010
belonged to one family.

14:33.680 --> 14:35.648
The Von Reichmerls.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.325
What happened to them?

14:37.720 --> 14:40.690
Hmm. Interesting story.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.840
Apparently, the last baron

14:43.920 --> 14:46.764
was so obsessed with
the purity of his bloodline...

14:46.920 --> 14:48.480
he decided only his sister

14:48.560 --> 14:50.688
was clean enough to carry his child.

14:51.920 --> 14:54.844
When the church forbade
the union, he renounced God.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.440
That must have gone over well.

14:56.520 --> 14:57.567
No shit.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.244
So on his wedding night...

15:00.400 --> 15:01.970
the villagers came up the hill...

15:02.640 --> 15:06.122
chased the Baron and his bride
into the catacombs...

15:06.280 --> 15:08.931
and made him watch
while they burned her alive.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.321
Then they burned
the whole place to the ground.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.642
That's a hell of a story.

15:22.240 --> 15:23.321
Yeah.

15:24.160 --> 15:25.889
But that was 200 years ago.

15:26.040 --> 15:28.168
A lot's changed since then.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.565
20 minutes max.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.165
No hurry.

16:03.440 --> 16:04.726
Welcome!

16:13.960 --> 16:14.961
May I help you?

16:15.160 --> 16:17.970
I'm here to see a guest.
Mr. Roland Pembroke.

16:18.160 --> 16:19.889
I'm sorry, but visiting hours
are over for the day.

16:27.720 --> 16:28.926
I've come a long way.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.287
Maybe you could make an exception.

16:31.440 --> 16:33.090
There are no exceptions.

16:35.320 --> 16:36.526
Is there a manager I could speak to?

16:39.560 --> 16:41.130
Sign here.

16:41.280 --> 16:42.281
Please.

16:44.880 --> 16:48.089
Thank you, Mr. Lockhart.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.969
I'll see what I can do.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.602
You won't get any service here.

16:59.760 --> 17:01.091
Part of the treatment.

17:01.240 --> 17:02.526
You get used to it.

17:02.680 --> 17:05.330
What's a ten-letter word for amnesty?

17:05.480 --> 17:06.481
No idea.

17:06.640 --> 17:07.766
Exemption.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.723
Nope. That's only nine.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.251
Absolution.

17:13.280 --> 17:14.361
Yes!

17:15.680 --> 17:17.329
You like puzzles?

17:17.920 --> 17:18.921
Not really.

17:29.960 --> 17:31.007
You mind?

17:59.480 --> 18:00.481
Thank you.

18:14.280 --> 18:16.647
I believe the reception nurse explained...

18:16.800 --> 18:20.009
that visiting hours end
at 3:00 p.m. precisely.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.728
She did. But as I'm sure you're aware...

18:22.880 --> 18:24.560
Mr. Pembroke remains the CEO

18:24.640 --> 18:26.449
of a major financial institution.

18:27.560 --> 18:28.800
Under the circumstances,

18:28.920 --> 18:30.410
I was hoping you can make an...

18:31.920 --> 18:33.365
exception.

18:34.920 --> 18:35.921
Vitamins.

18:36.760 --> 18:39.604
If we are to help the people
that come here...

18:39.800 --> 18:41.802
we must keep up our strength.

18:42.880 --> 18:46.009
May one ask what it is concerning?

18:46.160 --> 18:47.605
It's a business matter.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.884
I'm not at liberty to say
any more than that.

18:51.040 --> 18:53.200
Of course. And I hope you understand

18:53.280 --> 18:55.089
that we also have our rules.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.561
Our treatments here are most effective...

18:57.720 --> 18:59.240
when exposure to the stresses

18:59.320 --> 19:00.810
of the modern world is strictly limited.

19:00.960 --> 19:02.689
Director Volmer is quite firm on that.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.001
Hydrotherapy?

19:05.160 --> 19:06.161
That is correct.

19:06.320 --> 19:08.482
That's a long way to come just for water.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.482
The sanitarium is built
over an ancient aquifer...

19:12.640 --> 19:16.531
that offers uniquely
rejuvenating qualities.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.241
Rebuilt.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.929
After the fire.

19:29.680 --> 19:30.761
Yes.

19:32.120 --> 19:34.282
History is full of darkness.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.722
If you would like to leave a note...

19:37.880 --> 19:40.770
I'd happily pass it along to Mr. Pembroke.

19:40.920 --> 19:43.571
Mr. Pieterson?

19:44.240 --> 19:47.210
I understand the work
you do here is important...

19:47.360 --> 19:50.250
and you're obviously a very busy man.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.680
But if you wouldn't mind
finding time between

19:53.760 --> 19:55.569
administering aqua aerobics
and Jacuzzis...

19:55.720 --> 19:57.688
to inform Mr. Pembroke he has a visitor...

19:57.880 --> 20:01.168
with information of the utmost
urgency to him personally...

20:01.320 --> 20:02.685
I'd be grateful.

20:04.760 --> 20:06.440
On the other hand, if you
want me to write a note...

20:06.520 --> 20:08.640
so you can slip it under his door
with his breakfast tray...

20:08.720 --> 20:11.281
on the off-chance he notices it
before his morning rubdown...

20:11.480 --> 20:13.209
I'm afraid that's not gonna cut it.

20:13.360 --> 20:15.761
You see, I just traveled
4,000 miles to get here.

20:15.920 --> 20:17.649
There's a red-eye going back
to New York tonight...

20:17.800 --> 20:20.531
and I intend Mr. Pembroke
and I to be on it.

20:25.080 --> 20:28.129
You plan to take Mr. Pembroke
back to New York with you?

20:28.280 --> 20:29.645
Is that a problem?

20:29.800 --> 20:33.282
Of course, it is entirely
up to Mr. Pembroke.

20:33.440 --> 20:36.410
He's a patient, not a prisoner.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.207
He'll be in treatment until after 7:00.

20:42.360 --> 20:44.880
If you'd like to come back then,
I'll make sure he's available.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.049
Thank you for your understanding.

20:58.560 --> 20:59.925
Leaving already?

21:00.080 --> 21:01.840
What a nice-looking young man.

21:01.920 --> 21:03.040
Where's your friend?

21:03.120 --> 21:04.121
What time's the last train to Zurich?

21:04.240 --> 21:05.240
Not till 10:00.

21:05.320 --> 21:07.288
Get me to a hotel. I gotta make a call.

22:48.760 --> 22:49.761
Pretty girl.

22:57.800 --> 22:58.881
What the fuck!

23:42.320 --> 23:44.243
How long will you be gone?

23:45.080 --> 23:46.730
Just a few days.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.002
Are we waiting for someone else?

23:54.680 --> 23:56.523
There is no one else.

25:10.960 --> 25:12.450
Sleep well?

25:12.840 --> 25:13.841
Uh...

25:17.840 --> 25:21.447
I can't remember having slept better.

25:21.600 --> 25:22.601
It's the mountain air.

25:24.720 --> 25:25.767
Mr. Lockhart...

25:27.800 --> 25:29.450
my name is Henrich Volmer.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.443
I am the director of the sanitarium here.

25:32.360 --> 25:33.850
How long have I been here?

25:34.000 --> 25:35.047
Three days.

25:35.640 --> 25:36.801
Oh, Jesus!

25:39.000 --> 25:42.288
You can count yourself lucky.
It was a clean break.

25:42.440 --> 25:44.841
Although I do feel partly responsible.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.321
The locals tell me I should hunt
the deer on the property...

25:47.520 --> 25:51.120
but I can't bring myself to harm
the innocent creatures.

25:51.320 --> 25:53.891
After all, they were here long before us.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.205
I need to call New York.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.920
I took the liberty
of informing your office

26:00.000 --> 26:02.082
of the accident, if that's your concern.

26:02.240 --> 26:04.163
They agreed with me...

26:04.320 --> 26:07.927
that business can wait
and your health cannot.

26:08.520 --> 26:10.727
Hank Green said that?

26:10.920 --> 26:12.280
Even the acting head

26:12.360 --> 26:14.044
of a major Wall Street finance firm...

26:14.200 --> 26:18.002
can't argue with the consequences
of a serious car accident.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.685
We don't get many visitors here.

26:21.680 --> 26:24.843
Most of my patients have done
extraordinary things.

26:25.320 --> 26:27.163
Built vast fortunes...

26:27.320 --> 26:29.243
commanded great empires...

26:30.160 --> 26:31.889
but at a terrible cost.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.522
They have no one who cares for them.

26:38.920 --> 26:40.684
Mr. Pembroke is lucky.

26:40.840 --> 26:42.126
He has you.

26:42.720 --> 26:44.722
So, do your best to relax.

26:46.040 --> 26:47.201
Enjoy yourself.

26:47.960 --> 26:49.769
You are at the foot of the Swiss Alps...

26:49.960 --> 26:52.281
one of the most
beautiful places in the world.

26:52.440 --> 26:55.205
Think of it as an enforced vacation.

26:55.360 --> 26:56.440
Although I know you Americans

26:56.520 --> 26:58.727
are not so good at vacations, are you?

26:59.440 --> 27:01.363
And remember, you're at altitude.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.124
It can take a while to acclimatize...

27:03.280 --> 27:06.250
so please make sure
you drink plenty of water.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.885
Believe me, you're in good hands.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.081
Are you lost?

30:16.960 --> 30:19.088
Uh... Yeah.

30:20.320 --> 30:21.606
I guess so.

30:21.760 --> 30:23.410
Where is it you're supposed to be?

30:24.400 --> 30:25.606
I don't know.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.081
Name?

30:28.320 --> 30:29.560
Pembroke.

30:31.920 --> 30:34.605
Roland Pembroke.

30:34.760 --> 30:35.841
Here it is.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.641
Pembroke. Room 609. Steam bath.

30:42.840 --> 30:44.444
Of course.

30:47.080 --> 30:48.764
Mr. Pembroke...

30:48.920 --> 30:50.922
the steam baths are in that direction.

31:04.440 --> 31:06.124
You can't go in there.

31:10.600 --> 31:11.965
Not like that.

34:22.679 --> 34:24.205
Pembroke?

34:29.000 --> 34:31.367
It is Mr. Pembroke, isn't it?

34:32.159 --> 34:33.525
Do I know you?

34:33.679 --> 34:36.411
My name is Lockhart. Mr. Green sent me.

34:37.760 --> 34:39.489
I thought they'd send Morris.

34:39.679 --> 34:41.091
Morris is dead.

34:42.320 --> 34:43.560
Heart attack.

34:50.320 --> 34:52.766
Mr. Pembroke, I've come to
bring you back to New York.

34:56.440 --> 34:57.680
You want me to leave here?

34:57.840 --> 34:59.251
Just for a few days.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.240
I'm afraid I can't do that.

35:01.400 --> 35:02.401
Why not?

35:03.200 --> 35:04.361
I'm not well.

35:05.280 --> 35:06.691
You look all right to me.

35:06.840 --> 35:08.251
That's because you are blind.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.611
As I was.

35:12.400 --> 35:14.209
But soon you'll see.

35:14.360 --> 35:17.204
Rest assured,
they'll take good care of you here.

35:18.400 --> 35:20.243
I'm not a patient.

35:20.400 --> 35:22.129
What happened to your leg?

35:23.920 --> 35:25.490
Mr. Pembroke, the situation in New York

35:25.600 --> 35:26.647
is really quite serious.

35:26.800 --> 35:28.404
No longer my concern.

35:29.200 --> 35:31.601
The director says
I must not involve myself

35:31.720 --> 35:33.085
in business matters.

35:33.880 --> 35:35.484
Have you met Director Volmer?

35:36.560 --> 35:37.561
This morning.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.643
He is a great man.

35:41.040 --> 35:42.451
Kind man.

35:42.600 --> 35:44.568
Not like other doctors.

35:44.720 --> 35:45.721
Mr. Pembroke...

35:45.880 --> 35:47.928
This obsession with blood.

35:48.400 --> 35:49.890
You see, they have it all wrong.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.082
Do you know the body is 65% water?

35:52.240 --> 35:54.083
It's our fluids that must be purified.

35:54.240 --> 35:56.402
Word that the merger
is in trouble has leaked.

35:56.560 --> 35:57.721
The share price is in free fall.

35:57.840 --> 35:58.966
Lockhart?

36:00.240 --> 36:02.811
You're not any relation
to Henry Lockhart, are you?

36:03.920 --> 36:05.081
My father.

36:06.440 --> 36:08.090
You knew him?

36:08.440 --> 36:10.249
We started out together.

36:12.440 --> 36:14.442
Terrible, what happened to him.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.605
They said there was a boy left in the car.

36:24.280 --> 36:26.487
I don't remember much, to be honest.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.002
He didn't deserve what we did to him.

36:33.040 --> 36:34.451
What do you mean?

36:34.600 --> 36:36.284
He was an honest man.

36:36.760 --> 36:38.967
And we destroyed him for it.

36:39.120 --> 36:42.124
Well, people get fucked over every day.

36:42.280 --> 36:44.965
Either you have what it takes
to survive, or you don't.

36:45.480 --> 36:46.811
And I suppose you do.

36:48.280 --> 36:50.328
Is that why you came all this way?

36:50.520 --> 36:51.851
Ambition?

36:54.000 --> 36:56.526
Then you have it worse than any of us.

36:57.480 --> 36:58.845
What's that?

36:59.960 --> 37:01.121
The sickness.

37:03.120 --> 37:06.841
Your father saw the truth
long before the rest of us.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.970
The pointlessness of the entire endeavor.

37:11.160 --> 37:13.481
We've all done terrible things.

37:14.680 --> 37:16.808
So many terrible things.

37:47.240 --> 37:48.446
What's it trading at?

37:49.880 --> 37:51.006
What?

37:51.200 --> 37:53.202
The stock! What's it trading at?

37:54.680 --> 37:56.091
Eight and a half at close on Friday.

37:56.200 --> 37:57.201
Parasites.

37:57.360 --> 37:59.362
It'll be lower by now.

37:59.520 --> 38:01.807
We're all concerned for your
well-being, Mr. Pembroke.

38:02.040 --> 38:03.120
Mmm.

38:03.200 --> 38:05.043
Just a few days.

38:05.720 --> 38:08.000
There are certain irregularities
in some of the accounts...

38:08.080 --> 38:09.525
that need to be clarified before

38:09.640 --> 38:10.801
the merger can be completed.

38:11.880 --> 38:14.929
And I suppose someone
has to take responsibility.

38:16.640 --> 38:18.051
Something like that.

38:20.080 --> 38:22.048
Then I better get my things.

38:26.720 --> 38:29.041
I need a car to take me to the station.

38:31.720 --> 38:33.404
Will you call one for me, please?

38:33.560 --> 38:35.130
I'll see what I can do.

39:13.920 --> 39:16.048
That's where the baron hung the priest.

39:16.200 --> 39:18.043
- What's that?
- See?

39:19.640 --> 39:22.325
The church would have been
right over there...

39:23.280 --> 39:24.400
where that funny little building is now.

39:24.480 --> 39:25.527
I'm sure of it.

39:26.360 --> 39:28.044
People used to come from miles around...

39:28.200 --> 39:30.168
for the miracles attributed
to the holy water.

39:30.320 --> 39:32.641
Guess some things don't change.

39:32.800 --> 39:33.801
How marvelous.

39:34.840 --> 39:37.207
Terrible thing, though. Such violence.

39:37.360 --> 39:39.647
That's what you get
for marrying your sister.

39:40.720 --> 39:42.051
Sister?

39:42.200 --> 39:44.282
Yeah, it was all about
a pure bloodline, wasn't it?

39:45.160 --> 39:46.685
How fascinating!

39:46.840 --> 39:47.841
I must look into that.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.126
Glad to see you're back on your feet!

39:50.120 --> 39:51.804
We heard about the accident.

39:52.720 --> 39:55.166
You're American, aren't you, Mister...

39:55.320 --> 39:56.401
Lockhart.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.528
Frank Hill. Stockholm.

39:58.680 --> 40:00.682
And this is Mr. Nair from London.

40:00.840 --> 40:02.171
Bombay, originally.

40:02.640 --> 40:05.484
I see you've met Mrs. Watkins,
our amateur historian.

40:05.640 --> 40:06.926
Yes, of course. How rude.

40:07.080 --> 40:09.003
Victoria Watkins. 40 years at Xerox.

40:09.160 --> 40:10.400
Why don't you pull up a chair?

40:10.560 --> 40:12.005
We need a fourth.

40:13.160 --> 40:15.083
Careful. Like most Brahmins, he cheats.

40:15.240 --> 40:17.208
Coming from a venture capitalist,

40:17.320 --> 40:18.606
I take that as a compliment.

40:18.760 --> 40:20.160
Actually, I was just on my way back

40:20.240 --> 40:21.401
to New York with Mr. Pembroke.

40:25.680 --> 40:26.841
Then he's...

40:27.840 --> 40:28.921
He's feeling better?

40:30.520 --> 40:32.045
Well enough.

40:32.720 --> 40:35.371
I suppose that's wonderful news.

40:36.120 --> 40:37.849
Isn't that right, Mr. Nair?

40:38.720 --> 40:40.210
Wonderful news.

40:41.280 --> 40:42.566
Mrs. Watkins...

40:43.080 --> 40:44.127
time for your treatment.

40:44.280 --> 40:45.361
Yes, of course.

40:46.040 --> 40:48.247
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Lockhart.

40:48.400 --> 40:49.606
Safe travels.

41:34.720 --> 41:36.529
Something in the water?

41:38.600 --> 41:40.204
At the bottom.

41:47.280 --> 41:48.441
I don't see anything.

41:52.640 --> 41:53.880
Did it hurt?

41:55.200 --> 41:56.611
Can't remember.

41:59.200 --> 42:00.611
Better that way.

42:03.560 --> 42:05.005
I saw you.

42:05.800 --> 42:07.290
Before.

42:09.800 --> 42:11.450
Are you a patient here?

42:13.360 --> 42:15.000
It's just, you're so much younger

42:15.080 --> 42:16.286
than everyone else.

42:18.360 --> 42:21.204
Director Volmer says I'm a special case.

42:23.680 --> 42:25.125
What about you?

42:28.240 --> 42:29.605
Are you here for the cure?

42:31.960 --> 42:33.246
No.

42:33.440 --> 42:34.965
Actually, I was just leaving.

42:35.120 --> 42:36.565
No one ever leaves.

42:38.920 --> 42:40.570
What are you talking about?

42:42.680 --> 42:44.523
Why would anyone want to?

42:51.320 --> 42:53.163
Yeah, I see your point.

42:56.880 --> 42:58.962
Did you get what you came for?

43:01.880 --> 43:05.521
Well, I came to bring
someone back to New York.

43:07.120 --> 43:08.645
So, yeah. I did.

43:10.760 --> 43:12.410
Does he want to go?

43:15.640 --> 43:16.926
Not really.

43:23.560 --> 43:25.403
That song you were singing.

43:26.800 --> 43:28.006
Where did you learn that?

43:37.520 --> 43:38.885
I have to go now.

43:44.360 --> 43:46.283
What's your name?

43:48.840 --> 43:50.126
Hannah.

44:31.080 --> 44:32.525
Mr. Pembroke?

44:36.720 --> 44:38.643
Where's Pembroke?

44:39.720 --> 44:42.610
The patient that was
in this room, where is he?

44:44.080 --> 44:45.923
I thought you were Pembroke.

45:01.960 --> 45:04.040
Do you know what they used to recommend

45:04.120 --> 45:05.804
for the common stomach ailment?

45:05.960 --> 45:08.042
The application of leeches.

45:08.200 --> 45:11.682
Based on the diagnosis,
I always pitied the leech.

45:15.400 --> 45:17.562
Mmm. Mr. Lockhart...

45:17.720 --> 45:19.245
please, won't you join us?

45:19.440 --> 45:20.760
The sturgeon is excellent,

45:20.840 --> 45:22.808
unless of course you prefer the venison.

45:22.960 --> 45:24.724
I couldn't let it go to waste.

45:25.320 --> 45:26.970
Where's Pembroke?

45:27.160 --> 45:30.448
Mr. Pembroke has unfortunately
taken a turn for the worse.

45:30.600 --> 45:33.046
I fear your conversation
about business matters...

45:33.200 --> 45:34.964
has set him back somewhat.

45:35.120 --> 45:36.960
But, no matter. We have moved him on

45:37.040 --> 45:38.201
to the next stage of treatment.

45:38.360 --> 45:39.646
He looked all right to me.

45:39.840 --> 45:41.126
But you're not a doctor.

45:41.280 --> 45:43.282
Maybe it's time for a second opinion.

45:43.440 --> 45:45.602
That, of course, is up to Mr. Pembroke.

45:45.800 --> 45:47.404
And he's not available.

45:47.560 --> 45:49.244
Ever since I got here...

45:49.400 --> 45:51.448
you people have been
giving me the runaround.

45:51.640 --> 45:53.449
I would ask you please
to keep your voice down.

45:53.640 --> 45:55.961
We wouldn't wanna upset
the clientele, would we?

45:56.120 --> 45:57.960
Mr. Lockhart, giving you the runaround

45:58.040 --> 45:59.724
is the furthest thing from my mind.

45:59.880 --> 46:03.168
My sole concern is for
the welfare of my patients.

46:03.360 --> 46:05.806
It's bad for business if
people start getting better.

46:05.960 --> 46:07.530
Am I right?

46:07.680 --> 46:09.523
What are you implying, Mr. Lockhart?

46:09.680 --> 46:12.160
Old people paying through
the teeth for what? Water?

46:12.320 --> 46:13.810
What's your overhead anyway?

46:14.000 --> 46:15.570
That is not your concern.

46:15.720 --> 46:17.609
I don't wanna have to
get lawyers involved...

46:17.760 --> 46:19.603
but I came to get Pembroke
back to New York...

46:19.760 --> 46:22.240
and that's what I'm gonna do,
if I have to hit him over his head...

46:22.400 --> 46:24.368
and drag him out by his hair.

46:24.920 --> 46:27.844
Are you feeling all right,
Mr. Lockhart? You seem pale.

46:29.400 --> 46:30.845
I'm fine.

46:33.240 --> 46:34.321
You're bleeding.

46:35.600 --> 46:36.681
What?

46:57.720 --> 46:59.370
Perhaps you should sit down.

47:18.680 --> 47:20.682
No signs of concussion.

47:21.480 --> 47:23.403
Any headaches, hallucinations?

47:24.880 --> 47:26.006
No.

47:26.880 --> 47:28.041
You may dress.

47:29.800 --> 47:31.609
Are you drinking the water?

47:32.440 --> 47:33.441
Yes.

47:34.600 --> 47:35.840
Good.

47:36.040 --> 47:37.246
Make sure you do.

47:39.480 --> 47:41.801
I took the liberty of running a few tests

47:41.920 --> 47:43.046
after the accident.

47:43.160 --> 47:44.161
Hannah.

47:45.080 --> 47:46.161
Isn't it?

47:46.880 --> 47:47.881
Yes.

47:48.560 --> 47:50.210
She's a very special case.

47:50.360 --> 47:52.328
What does that mean exactly?

47:52.960 --> 47:55.400
She was exposed to serious trauma

47:55.480 --> 47:56.641
when she was very young.

47:56.800 --> 47:58.643
Her development was delayed.

47:59.360 --> 48:02.603
Hannah did not utter a word
until she was 11 years old.

48:04.680 --> 48:06.364
Please understand...

48:06.520 --> 48:07.931
Mr. Lockhart...

48:09.880 --> 48:12.565
she is like a daughter to me.

48:15.480 --> 48:18.563
But we're here to discuss you.

48:20.240 --> 48:22.402
An imbalance in your fluids.

48:22.560 --> 48:24.562
Strain to the major organs.

48:24.720 --> 48:26.484
Depleted immune system.

48:26.640 --> 48:28.520
Many indicators that you have in common

48:28.600 --> 48:29.840
with most of my patients...

48:30.600 --> 48:32.409
but I will confess
I have never seen a case...

48:32.560 --> 48:34.961
as advanced as this...

48:35.720 --> 48:37.848
in someone so young.

48:39.160 --> 48:40.605
Is that right?

48:44.440 --> 48:46.169
Tell me, Mr. Lockhart...

48:46.360 --> 48:50.285
when was the last time
that you actually felt well?

48:51.040 --> 48:53.247
Before you came here,
when was the last time...

48:53.400 --> 48:55.767
that you even slept through the night?

48:56.320 --> 48:58.641
The mind may lie...

48:59.040 --> 49:00.644
but the body cannot.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.162
I should like to help you.

49:04.320 --> 49:05.321
What we offer here...

49:05.480 --> 49:08.484
is a simple process of purification.

49:09.280 --> 49:12.090
Away from pressures of the modern world.

49:12.720 --> 49:15.041
A return to a simpler time.

49:15.200 --> 49:17.851
Mr. Pembroke will not be ready
to travel for a day or two.

49:18.640 --> 49:19.926
And if you're willing...

49:20.080 --> 49:22.606
I would like to recommend a treatment.

49:23.320 --> 49:24.924
I can speak to the duty nurse...

49:25.080 --> 49:27.651
and we may be able to start
as early as this evening.

49:29.720 --> 49:31.768
If you think it's necessary.

49:32.160 --> 49:33.161
Good.

49:35.880 --> 49:36.881
Greta?

49:37.880 --> 49:38.927
Greta?

49:53.040 --> 49:55.042
You're in luck, Mr. Lockhart.

49:55.960 --> 49:57.883
We can get you in right away.

49:58.440 --> 49:59.646
"VR."

50:03.720 --> 50:04.721
Von Reichmerl.

50:05.960 --> 50:08.201
It was found during the reconstruction.

50:09.960 --> 50:12.008
Then it belong to the baron?

50:12.160 --> 50:14.447
The baroness, actually.

50:14.600 --> 50:16.568
Vanessa Von Reichmerl.

50:16.720 --> 50:18.404
She was sickly.

50:21.120 --> 50:23.248
The Baron was obsessed
with finding a cure.

50:23.720 --> 50:25.960
It was he, in fact, who first discovered

50:26.040 --> 50:28.042
the medicinal properties of our water.

50:31.480 --> 50:33.608
He sacrificed everything.

50:34.120 --> 50:36.202
He must have loved her very much.

50:37.720 --> 50:38.846
Yes.

50:39.680 --> 50:41.091
Like a sister.

50:46.040 --> 50:49.681
History is right, of course,
to judge him on moral grounds.

50:50.880 --> 50:53.121
But, as a man of science...

50:53.320 --> 50:55.209
I can't help but admire him.

50:57.480 --> 51:00.848
The duty nurse will escort you
to our isolation wing.

51:02.360 --> 51:03.361
Thank you.

51:05.520 --> 51:06.521
Mr. Lockhart...

51:10.080 --> 51:11.730
If you wouldn't mind.

51:12.440 --> 51:15.330
Just so we can keep an eye
on your progress.

52:21.760 --> 52:23.285
Are you ready, Mr. Lockhart?

52:31.680 --> 52:33.330
Then let us begin.

52:34.280 --> 52:37.602
Life on this planet first came from water.

52:41.240 --> 52:45.484
We spend the first nine months
of our existence submerged...

52:45.680 --> 52:48.047
our bodies mostly liquid.

52:48.200 --> 52:50.800
This sensory deprivation chamber

52:50.880 --> 52:52.166
simulates a return...

52:52.320 --> 52:54.322
to that embryonic state.

52:55.640 --> 52:58.484
Think of it as a cleansing of the mind...

52:58.640 --> 53:00.290
as much as the body.

53:02.920 --> 53:06.481
Some patients experience
increased heart rate...

53:07.640 --> 53:09.130
visions...

53:09.760 --> 53:11.250
even primal memories.

53:12.480 --> 53:13.480
But rest assured,

53:13.560 --> 53:16.131
it's just the toxins leaving the system.

53:18.400 --> 53:21.290
Give yourself over completely
to the process...

53:22.280 --> 53:24.601
and you will see the results.

53:26.720 --> 53:27.846
Keep a close eye on him.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.001
Yes, sir.

53:34.960 --> 53:35.961
Mr. Lockhart...

53:36.120 --> 53:38.282
the treatment lasts 30 minutes.

53:38.480 --> 53:39.480
I'll be monitoring you from here.

53:39.560 --> 53:40.560
If you have any issues...

53:40.640 --> 53:42.404
just tap on the side of the tank.

54:20.680 --> 54:21.727
Get back!

57:25.160 --> 57:28.046
In the last five days, a total collapse.

57:28.200 --> 57:31.044
The Dow plunging over 508 points...

57:31.200 --> 57:33.521
as panic spread throughout Wall Street...

57:33.720 --> 57:36.126
wiping out more than
one-third of the gains...

57:36.280 --> 57:38.044
from this rare, five-year bull market.

57:38.200 --> 57:40.851
More than half of that
in a single trading day.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.810
Chairman of New York
Stock Exchange, John Phelan...

57:43.960 --> 57:45.962
tried to reassure investors.

57:57.200 --> 57:58.281
Dad?

58:03.920 --> 58:04.967
Dad!

58:11.720 --> 58:13.449
Mr. Lockhart, are you all right?

58:13.600 --> 58:14.601
Get off me.

58:14.800 --> 58:15.881
Try to stay calm.

58:16.040 --> 58:17.080
I'm terribly sorry.

58:17.160 --> 58:18.321
Something must have
gone wrong with the machine.

58:18.480 --> 58:19.880
There's something in the water.

58:22.080 --> 58:23.923
There's something in the fucking water.

58:43.120 --> 58:45.646
There is nothing in the water,
Mr. Lockhart.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.729
But I saw them.

58:58.880 --> 59:00.120
As the Director explained...

59:00.280 --> 59:02.000
some patients experience visions

59:02.080 --> 59:03.411
with this particular treatment.

59:03.600 --> 59:06.001
Just the toxins leaving the body.

59:06.160 --> 59:08.162
It's all part of the cure.

59:09.520 --> 59:11.682
You need to rest now.

59:11.840 --> 59:13.524
I will help you to your room.

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.360
Got you.

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:38.201
Morning, Lockhart.

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:40.161
Feeling better?

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.210
Joining us for breakfast?

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.850
The kedgeree is excellent.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.411
I'm not hungry.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.210
You must keep up your strength.

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:57.727
Mrs. Watkins?

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:02.082
That building where the church
used to be...

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.011
What's it used for now?

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:05.971
I couldn't say.

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:10.202
You were right about
the baron and his sister.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.289
But that's not the reason
the villagers burned the place down.

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:15.408
It was on account of the experiments.

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.401
Some sort of medical experiments.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.163
Apparently performed on his own peasants.

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:23.970
People went missing.

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.201
And then...

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:28.762
Im Jahre 1814...

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:33.244
farmers, tilling their fields,
stumbled on human bodies...

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.607
disfigured and emaciated.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:39.528
Dried up like the mummies of Egypt.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:43.604
He was looking for a cure.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.603
- A cure?
- For the baroness.

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.205
She was sick.

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.210
Oh, I see.

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:53.086
I knew you liked puzzles.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.531
Of course.

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:01.361
Mrs. Watkins...

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:03.485
time for your treatment.

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:05.681
Are you certain?

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.723
I just had one this morning.
I'm sure of it.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.963
I have you on the schedule.

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.644
I must not be feeling myself today.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.122
There is a terrible darkness here.

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:51.166
What is this place?

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:57.167
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.845
I thought I saw you with a patient.

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:03.482
No. Patient.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.361
Okay.

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.521
Thank you.

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:25.441
Going for a swim?

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.203
I'm not supposed to.

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:32.681
Why's that?

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:35.047
On the account of my condition.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.809
Thought the water made you better.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.841
Told you. I'm a special case.

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:43.841
Right.

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:47.530
How far is it to town?

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:50.723
A few miles, I think.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.403
Are you going to walk all the way?

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.768
Unless you wanna lend me your bike.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.604
What will you give me?

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:29.050
It was my mother's.

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.004
Her eyes are closed.

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:41.285
Yeah, she's dreaming.
She just doesn't know it.

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:46.401
What happens if she wakes up?

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:49.846
I don't know.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.848
My mother never finished the story.

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.886
So, we got a deal?

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.527
How will you ride it?

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:06.043
Maybe you could come along.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.808
I'm not supposed to.

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.771
You always do what you're supposed to do?

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:22.967
It's okay.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:05.361
Coming?

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:20.604
Want a beer or something?

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.886
I don't know. Do I?

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.325
I don't know what you want.

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.247
All right. If you're having one.

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:39.961
Still here?

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.447
Thought you were just visiting.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.243
You've looked better.

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.451
Same to you.

01:08:48.319 --> 01:08:49.446
How's the car?

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.563
That car was a piece of shit.

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:55.805
Sanitarium offered me enough
to buy a new one.

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:57.325
So, gracias a Dios.

01:08:57.479 --> 01:08:59.642
Everything happens for a reason, right?

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.126
You drink too much.

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:06.042
I hope you're not driving.

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:09.602
You two are from up on the hill?

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:11.680
That's right.

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:14.040
We don't get many patients down here.

01:09:23.399 --> 01:09:25.004
Good kids at heart.

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:26.571
Just weren't raised properly.

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:29.682
No respect for tradition.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.923
Know if there's a doctor in town?

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.723
All the doctors are up on the hill.

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.404
A pharmacist?

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.085
Something like that?

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.720
There's Pieter. Over the road.

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:43.930
He a doctor?

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.769
Close enough.

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:13.046
Don't you like it?

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.205
No.

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:18.408
What, you never had a beer before?

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:28.728
How long have you been at the sanitarium?

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:31.167
Since I can remember.

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.845
What about your family?

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.486
My mother died in a fire when I was young.

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:38.480
Director Volmer says that
my father will come for me

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:39.800
when I'm better.

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:42.811
Does he visit?

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.929
He'll come when I'm better.

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:54.848
- Vitamins?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.365
Can I try?

01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:57.481
Um...

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:00.287
Okay.

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:08.320
Ugh.

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:13.407
Tastes like sweaty seafood.

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:17.123
You get used to it. Eventually.

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.849
Will you be okay here for a few minutes?

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:26.960
I just have to go see about something.

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:28.883
But I won't be long.

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:33.368
Uh... Yeah. Okay.

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:00.406
Hello?

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:15.003
Do you know if there's a doctor here?

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:23.291
What's that you're drawing?

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:25.970
He won't talk to you.

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:30.169
Doesn't know how.

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:33.927
That's the castle...

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.843
when they burned it down.

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:41.442
My grandson, Wilmosh.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.887
He likes ghost stories.

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:45.644
What can I do for you?

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.846
Could you take a look at this,
tell me what it says?

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:52.481
Human?

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:53.886
That's right.

01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:55.121
Not my line.

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.406
I'll pay you.

01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:02.126
How much is this?

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:06.281
Not much.

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:10.571
But enough.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.041
Got a tampon?

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.689
My friend's time of the month.

01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:58.961
Freak.

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.685
So is he fit to travel?

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:03.568
He's not a well man.

01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:05.802
Some of those are
dental records, aren't they?

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:08.170
- That's right.
- What do they mean?

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:11.288
His teeth are falling out.

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:14.770
What could cause something like that?

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.007
Barring any pre-existing
condition, I'd say...

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.003
chronic dehydration.

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.530
Dehydration?

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:28.528
All they do up there is drink water.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.889
I'm not a doctor.

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:34.326
Now, if you'll excuse me...

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.005
Wait a second.

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.883
The baron's experiments.

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.724
They found bodies in the fields, right?

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:42.803
Dried up like mummies.

01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:44.883
Maybe there's some kind of connection.

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:47.240
The baron was burned alive

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:48.765
on his wedding night 200 years ago.

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:51.611
Yeah, but this is happening now.

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.046
People come here for the cure.

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.160
That's what the baron was looking for.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.241
His wife was sick.

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:56.805
She wasn't sick.

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:00.049
She was infertile.

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:56.803
They tried for years.

01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:59.681
But the baroness could not
carry a child to term.

01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:02.360
They say her body rejected the fetuses

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:03.680
because they were deformed.

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:08.322
Now, you must excuse me.

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:11.811
I have to put this animal
out of its misery.

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:17.083
What's wrong with it?

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:20.369
Wandered off where
it wasn't supposed to be.

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:21.965
Broke its leg.

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:24.121
Like you.

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:28.361
Found it trapped in a drainage ditch...

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:31.565
drinking sewage water.

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:19.928
I need to make a phone call.
Long distance.

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.320
Your credit card.

01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.450
Lockhart.

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:38.681
Mr. Green.

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.205
Where the hell have you been?

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:41.686
I have a question.

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.808
Did Pembroke have
any pre-existing conditions?

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:44.961
What are you talking about?

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:46.240
Before he got here.

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.641
Any medical conditions? Was he sick?

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.640
No. The guy is a fucking health nut.

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:52.643
Drank kale for Christ's sake.

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:53.800
Now what the fuck is going on?

01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:55.211
You were supposed to be here
four days ago.

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:56.850
Yeah. But there was an accident.

01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:58.641
What accident?

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:00.727
What?

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:03.602
I don't understand.
They said they called you.

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:05.445
Nobody called.

01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:13.324
Are you sure about that?

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:15.403
Lockhart, do I have to reiterate to you...

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:17.523
the importance of what
you've been sent there to do?

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.968
Get Pembroke on a plane
within the next 24 hours...

01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:22.282
or this whole place goes ass over tits.

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:23.766
And you with it. Understand me?

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:28.841
Lockhart?

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:31.201
Lockhart!

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:36.610
- I need to speak with you
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.280
You said no one ever leaves.
What does that mean?

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:39.407
You're hurting me.

01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:41.369
- What happens to them?
- Please let me go.

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:42.965
Why won't they let me see Pembroke?

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:44.120
You know something, don't you?

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:45.247
No.

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:48.728
What is this stuff?
What makes you special?

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:50.330
Fuck off, Adolf!

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:54.121
Hey!

01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:55.486
- Come on.
- No!

01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:57.411
- I paid for this dance.
- No!

01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:58.640
Let her go!

01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:00.768
Go back to the sanitarium, cripple.

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:02.247
No!

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:04.769
No! Please, stop!

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:07.366
I am not a patient.

01:20:58.760 --> 01:20:59.886
Hannah.

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:16.041
Hannah.

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:18.283
She may look like a woman...

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.251
but she's just a child.

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:25.409
Ignorance, Mr. Lockhart...

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:30.731
is the great enemy of science.

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.849
I wanna see Pembroke.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:35.800
And you will.

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:48.890
Coming, Mr. Lockhart?

01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:53.241
Nothing happened.

01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:55.004
That's because I arrived when I did.

01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:57.330
Lockhart was there.

01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:59.289
With a knife to his throat.

01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:00.566
Hannah...

01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:02.449
Mr. Lockhart is not able
to look after himself,

01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:03.641
let alone you.

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:05.609
He can't protect you the way I can.

01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:07.000
I don't need protecting.

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:08.360
Of course you do.

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:11.530
We were just having fun.

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:14.044
He's not like the others.

01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:16.491
He's young.

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:22.601
What?

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:24.444
- What is it?
- Nothing.

01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:25.601
- Let me see.
- No.

01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:26.841
I'm your doctor. Come here.

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:28.166
No! Don't touch me!

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:37.884
When will I be ready?

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:40.207
Soon.

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:46.761
When?

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:48.680
Patience.

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:52.886
Come here.

01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:56.730
I said, come here.

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:06.850
Now, haven't I always looked after you?

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:10.927
Soon, I will make you better.

01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:13.405
And you will thank me.

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:18.410
And my father will come?

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:22.366
Yes.

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:29.082
Get some rest, my little lamb.

01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:31.801
Bitte?

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:36.410
I have a problem with my...

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:39.005
May I?

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:45.165
I'll just pop it in some milk, shall I?

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:11.481
There we are.

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:11.401
Mrs. Watkins?

01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:18.600
Where's Pembroke?

01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:21.365
You took him.

01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:24.080
Back to New York.

01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:26.129
What? No.

01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:28.442
They moved him. He's down here somewhere.

01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:32.360
You told me about
the experiments, remember?

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.045
Your puzzle?

01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:36.043
I like puzzles.

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:37.281
Yeah.

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:39.886
I left it for you.

01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:41.610
You'll see.

01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:43.640
Listen to me.

01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:46.050
The experiments...

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:47.929
I think they're happening again.

01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:49.764
The baroness was infertile.

01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:51.604
Not experiments.

01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:54.446
A cure.

01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:58.246
She was pregnant the night of the wedding.

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:01.046
Before they burned her...

01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:04.487
the villagers cut out the fetus...

01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:06.483
and threw it in the aquifer.

01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:09.768
The child survived.

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:14.250
She doesn't know.

01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:15.243
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:19.121
Take it easy.

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:21.250
Marcus!

01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:23.124
It's all right.

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:24.966
Mr. Lockhart...

01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:26.400
every time I turn around,

01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:28.130
you're somewhere
you're not supposed to be.

01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:30.163
I guess I'm lost.

01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:33.361
I'm just trying to find
my way back to my room.

01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:34.880
This is a restricted floor.

01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:36.121
There are signs everywhere.

01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:39.204
Surely you didn't just wander
down here by accident?

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.880
What is it exactly that
you are looking for?

01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:47.003
I had a problem with my tooth.

01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:49.000
Your tooth?

01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:52.005
Actually, it's feeling much better.

01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:54.606
If you could just point me
in the direction of my room.

01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:56.171
Nonsense.

01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:58.846
We can't let you get an infection.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.321
You must let us take care of you.

01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:02.521
After all...

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.162
that's why you're here.

01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:13.971
Doctor Brennan takes care

01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:16.208
of all our patients' dental needs.

01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:37.041
I'm sorry.

01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:38.520
Hmm?

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:39.647
About Hannah.

01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:43.326
It won't happen again.

01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:44.441
Hmm.

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:48.326
Tell me...

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:51.125
what were you doing in town?

01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:55.045
Just having a beer.

01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:56.321
Ah. Hmm.

01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:02.731
What are you doing?

01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:04.321
Get your hands off me!

01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:07.241
It's all for your own safety,
Mr. Lockhart.

01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:11.402
We don't believe in chemical
anesthesia at the institute.

01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:14.485
The impurities inhibit the cure.

01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:17.809
But, you will find that
with a proper focus...

01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:21.646
the mind can overcome any amount of pain.

01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:29.924
Trust, Mr. Lockhart. Hmm?

01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:36.441
I mean, if we can't trust each other...

01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:39.200
then how can I help you?

01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:57.966
Mrs. Abramov...

01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:00.731
so glad that you are here.

01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:02.644
How long do we have you with us?

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:04.211
Just two weeks.

01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:05.646
I probably overpacked.

01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:06.847
Nonsense.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.400
You'll be surprised
how time just slips away

01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:11.811
here at the institute.

01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:21.800
Drive!

01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:22.881
What happened to your face?

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.001
Just drive!

01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:33.210
They held me down and pulled my tooth out.

01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:35.362
They threatened me.

01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:37.170
Why would they do that?

01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:40.605
Because I know what they've done.

01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:45.842
There is a room full of bodies
floating in tanks like specimens.

01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:51.011
These are very serious allegations.

01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:52.561
No shit.

01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:56.081
Director Volmer is a well-respected man.

01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:59.407
The sanatorium is of great importance
for the local economy.

01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:02.040
Take me up there,
and I'll show you what I saw.

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.690
Do you have any identification on you?

01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:09.528
No, they have everything.

01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:11.887
Well, then, is there someone
I could speak to...

01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:14.884
who might confirm you are
who you say you are? Family?

01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:18.371
I hope you understand the need
to verify your identity.

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:20.769
You can call my office.

01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:24.725
All right.

01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:27.722
Can I get you coffee or tea?

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:32.608
You got anything stronger?

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:34.121
Of course.

01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:39.241
Rest assured...

01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:43.563
we will get to the bottom of this.

01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:46.401
Thank you.

01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:49.808
Mr. Lockhart,
we've been worried about you.

01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:51.325
Stay away from me!

01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:52.521
Is this man a patient of yours?

01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:53.681
Yes, that's right.

01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:56.366
I'm not a patient. I was in an accident.

01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:59.888
You signed the admission form.
I have it right here.

01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:01.121
That's bullshit.

01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:04.563
I did warn you about
possible delusions, remember?

01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:06.688
A side effect of the toxins
leaving the body.

01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:08.729
And my leg, is that a delusion?

01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:11.400
Mr. Lockhart has been a disruptive element

01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:12.561
since he arrived.

01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:14.927
He stole confidential medical files...

01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:17.321
assaulted a member of our Dental staff...

01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:18.845
and threatened Mr. Pembroke.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.321
I didn't threaten anybody!

01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:24.723
I believe your exact words were...

01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:28.240
"If I have to, I'll hit him over the head

01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:30.163
"and drag him out by his hair."

01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:34.245
I was sent here to bring
Pembroke back to New York!

01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:37.842
According to your employer, a Mr. Green...

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.206
you're being investigated

01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:41.169
by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:43.601
You're one of them.

01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:45.569
Listen to yourself, Mr. Lockhart.

01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:46.846
You're not a well man.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.367
Stop saying that!

01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:51.204
- Let us help you.
- Get back!

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:54.526
I know about the experiments.

01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:56.205
The baron and his wife.

01:41:56.360 --> 01:42:00.410
He has been spending time
with Mrs. Watkins.

01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:01.521
Who is Watkins?

01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:04.923
She was institutionalized
before she came to us.

01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:06.525
The others humor her...

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:08.927
but clearly Mr. Lockhart's condition

01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:11.202
has made him susceptible
to her conspiracies.

01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:13.761
I know what you're
trying to do. All of you.

01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:16.207
You're trying to make me think I'm insane.

01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:18.289
I have seen this before.

01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:19.970
It's not uncommon.

01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:23.727
Some deep-seated childhood
trauma rises to the surface...

01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:25.840
something a patient has been running from

01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:27.160
their entire life.

01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:29.770
In your case...

01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:33.322
I would say misplaced guilt...

01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:36.401
over the death of your father.

01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:40.131
How do you know about that?
I never told you that.

01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:42.251
You didn't have to.

01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:45.163
That's why you came to us, isn't it?

01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:49.002
I saw him.

01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:51.242
Pembroke is dead.

01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:54.006
That's what this is all about?

01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:57.767
The evil doctor killing off his patients?

01:42:57.920 --> 01:42:58.967
That's right.

01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:03.091
All right. Perhaps we should
consult Mr. Pembroke.

01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:09.010
Do you know this man?

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.367
He tried to take me back against my will.

01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:15.605
Pembroke?

01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:16.966
Please keep him away from me.

01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:19.489
You were dead.

01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:22.286
- Do you wish press charges?
- That won't be necessary.

01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:24.602
Mr. Lockhart is not a criminal.

01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:30.290
He is a patient.

01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:30.761
To the members of the board...

01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:34.041
You sent me here for a purpose.

01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:38.607
To retrieve a man against his will...

01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:43.090
and bring him back to your world.

01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:46.451
But I realize now...

01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:51.086
that is not the reason I am here.

01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:56.440
There is a sickness inside each of us.

01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:59.126
We do our best to deny its existence...

01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:00.930
dealing in lies...

01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:03.490
and distraction.

01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:08.005
Until one day the body
rebels against the mind

01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:09.246
and screams out...

01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:14.565
"I am not a well man."

01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:19.120
A man cannot unsee the truth.

01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:29.685
A man cannot unsee the truth.

01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:44.008
He cannot willingly return to darkness...

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:49.644
or go blind once he has
the gift of sight...

01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:57.531
any more than he can be unborn.

01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:50.361
Fuck.

01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:19.681
Hannah!

01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:23.927
Stay away from me.

01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:25.726
- Hannah.
- Stay away from me.

01:56:25.880 --> 01:56:27.564
- We need to go.
- I said stay away!

01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:34.000
There. Everything is all right.

01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:35.286
Please enjoy your meal.

01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:38.721
Hannah?

01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:41.249
What have you done?

01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:47.764
What's happening to me?

01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:51.083
Here, here, here.

01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:52.969
It's all right. You're safe now.

01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:54.081
Leave her alone.

01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:56.129
Haven't you upset her enough,
Mr. Lockhart?

01:56:56.320 --> 01:56:57.890
Please, escort the patient
back to his room.

01:56:58.040 --> 01:56:59.280
I am not a fucking patient!

01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:06.641
Come on!

01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:08.761
Come on!

01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:10.969
Had enough of cripples and old people?

01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:12.127
Try it with me!

01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:14.726
That's enough! Mr. Lockhart...

01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:16.445
I can see you're extremely upset.

01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:18.329
Why don't you come with me to my office...

01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:20.448
and we can discuss
whatever's on your mind.

01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:21.921
No.

01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:24.443
We're gonna talk about it right here.

01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:29.281
In front of everybody.

01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:30.771
I don't think that's a good idea.

01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:32.843
He's making you sick.

01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:37.529
This place is making you sick!

01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:44.965
It's in the water.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:48.161
Mr. Lockhart.

01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:50.766
I saw the bodies dried up like mummies!

01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:53.801
Look at you people!

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.490
Your teeth are falling out!

01:57:57.200 --> 01:57:59.123
You're dying, and you can't even see it.

01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:00.691
But I'm here for the cure.

01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:02.080
There is no cure!

01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:05.885
Don't you see?

01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:09.324
He's the one that is making you sick!

01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:11.323
There's nothing wrong with you people!

01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:13.841
I wouldn't do that, if I were you.

01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:16.884
There's nothing wrong with you.

01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:24.481
Yes.

01:58:25.720 --> 01:58:26.721
Yes!

01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:30.847
That's it!

01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:32.326
Stand up!

01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:37.806
Come on!

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:39.001
Yes!

01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:40.687
Stand up!

01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:43.530
He is making you sick!

01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:46.764
Yes, that's it. Come on.

01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:49.526
That's it!

01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:53.007
There's nothing wrong with you!

01:58:54.080 --> 01:58:57.004
I am not well.

01:58:57.160 --> 01:58:58.571
I am not well.

01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:00.886
What are you doing?

01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:03.401
What are you doing?

01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:09.361
Get the fuck off me!

01:59:09.520 --> 01:59:11.443
No. No, no!

01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:13.087
Get off me.

01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:15.250
Help me! Help!

01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:55.125
Pembroke.

01:59:55.760 --> 01:59:57.125
Pembroke.

02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:03.569
What have they done to you?

02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:05.930
Done to me?

02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:09.482
I've never felt better.

02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:15.529
Relax, Mr. Lockhart.

02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:17.125
It'll all be over soon.

02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:21.804
Ah, yes. Remarkable creatures.

02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:26.961
Anywhere else on the planet,

02:00:27.080 --> 02:00:29.811
this species lives a dozen years, at most.

02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:32.167
Here, in our aquifer...

02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:34.166
they can live 300.

02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:38.129
For the human physiology...

02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:40.851
the effect of the water can be quite toxic

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:42.525
as you have discovered.

02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:46.684
Unless, of course,
it is properly filtered.

02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:52.049
The baron devised the process.

02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:57.530
Using the bodies of peasants
that belonged to his land...

02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:01.000
he managed to distill the water...

02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:03.722
to its life-giving essence.

02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:07.166
Of course, he paid

02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:09.402
a terrible price for his ingenuity.

02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:11.121
His only mistake...

02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:14.521
was to use subjects who were unwilling.

02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:18.250
Luckily, times have changed.

02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:22.206
The last 200 years

02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:24.322
have been the most
productive in human history.

02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:26.847
Man rid himself of God...

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:30.049
of hierarchy, of everything
that gave him meaning...

02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:31.725
until he was left worshiping

02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:34.047
the empty altar of his own ambition.

02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:42.210
That is why they come.

02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:44.166
Men like you.

02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:49.364
You're quite right, Mr. Lockhart.

02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:50.885
No one ever leaves.

02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:54.921
What you fail to understand
is that no one wants to.

02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:17.249
Do you know what the cure
for the human condition is?

02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:21.081
Disease.

02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:25.321
Because only then
is there hope for a cure.

02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:17.284
I don't understand.

02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:20.650
For so many years,
I've tried to protect you...

02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:23.804
from the impurities of the outside world.

02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:27.165
But ironically, it is
your friend Mr. Lockhart

02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:28.486
who we have to thank.

02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:33.005
You're a woman now.

02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:36.485
But I'm not well.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:45.005
And I will always be here
to take care of you.

02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:20.851
She's awake now.

02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:30.404
You made me believe
I could leave here one day.

02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:38.248
Why would anybody wanna leave?

02:07:24.280 --> 02:07:25.441
What is it?

02:07:26.560 --> 02:07:27.561
Come.

02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:41.004
What is this place?

02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:47.728
This is where you began.

02:08:09.360 --> 02:08:10.771
I don't want to.

02:08:17.240 --> 02:08:18.765
You know...

02:08:18.960 --> 02:08:22.362
you look just like she did
on her wedding night.

02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:32.089
The night they took her from me.

02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:41.720
The villagers cut out the fetus

02:08:41.800 --> 02:08:43.404
and threw it in the aquifer.

02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:46.728
The child survived.

02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:19.201
Please don't.

02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:20.481
Don't be frightened.

02:09:20.640 --> 02:09:22.688
Soon we'll be a family again.

02:09:23.760 --> 02:09:25.444
The way we were always meant to be.

02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:42.531
It's all right.

02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:46.207
My sister was also
somewhat resistant, at first.

02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:50.365
But after a while, she grew to like it.

02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:57.849
We tried so many times
to make something pure.

02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:06.008
That something was you, my love.

02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:11.407
And now...

02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:14.481
we can begin again.

02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:47.927
I've waited so long.

02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:06.771
So long.

02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:22.607
He will have you. Yes?

02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:24.046
Yes.

02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:40.967
You can't keep her here forever.

02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:43.927
No?

02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:50.843
And what do you think would
become of her in your world?

02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:54.320
People like you come to me in droves

02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:56.004
with your disposable lives.

02:11:56.840 --> 02:11:58.285
She's your daughter.

02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:05.841
And what have you ever loved, hmm?

02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:09.241
What have you ever sacrificed?

02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:16.321
This is what the outside world has to offer.

02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:34.806
You're right.

02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:39.121
No.

02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:24.401
No.

02:14:06.520 --> 02:14:08.363
Fire. Fire!

02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:15.207
Everything I have built has been for her.

02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:23.684
You think I would let someone
like you destroy that?

02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:25.041
Dad?

02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:35.201
Hannah.

02:17:55.680 --> 02:17:57.762
Magnificent, isn't it?

02:18:08.360 --> 02:18:09.361
Lockhart!

02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:14.450
It's time to go.

02:18:32.879 --> 02:18:34.882
- Are you okay?
- Jesus Christ.

02:18:36.680 --> 02:18:39.001
Easy, easy.

02:18:39.559 --> 02:18:40.846
Lockhart?

02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:42.405
My God.

02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:44.365
What have you done?

02:18:46.520 --> 02:18:48.329
Where's Pembroke?

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:51.161
He's gone.

02:18:51.320 --> 02:18:52.924
What do you mean "gone"?

02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:55.245
Get in the car.

02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:03.321
You came here to perform a task, remember?

02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:05.682
Now get in the car.

02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:11.041
Did you hear what I said?

02:19:22.559 --> 02:19:24.289
Have you lost your mind?

02:19:27.760 --> 02:19:29.250
Actually...

02:19:31.440 --> 02:19:33.522
I'm feeling much better.

02:19:38.559 --> 02:19:40.528
Where the hell are you going?

02:19:40.719 --> 02:19:44.121
Lockhart! Lockhart!
