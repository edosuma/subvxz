Anyone watching
thinking we know fuck all

00:03.020 --> 00:06.779
about knowing fuck all about owt,
needs to watch their backs... Oh!

00:06.780 --> 00:10.779
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,
sending prices sky-high.

00:12.580 --> 00:16.579
Literally - literally - taking
the grass from its own roots!

00:17.140 --> 00:19.299
And now
you've got your Con-Dem-Nation.

00:19.300 --> 00:23.059
Liberals noshing Tories
like altar boys picking dimps up!

00:23.060 --> 00:26.539
Have we had a national
fucking stroke... or what?

00:26.540 --> 00:30.419
Is revolution a word...
or was it never?

00:30.420 --> 00:32.939
Anybody watching needs to know,

00:32.940 --> 00:36.379
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:36.380 --> 00:39.699
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester...

00:39.700 --> 00:42.579
and they charge us for water?!

00:42.580 --> 00:46.579
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found

00:47.260 --> 00:50.979
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times

00:50.980 --> 00:53.579
Yak! Yak! Yak! Yak! Yak! Yak!

00:53.580 --> 00:56.859
It's not theirs any more.

00:56.860 --> 00:58.299
This is our England now.

00:59.340 --> 01:01.179
Paaaarty!

01:11.860 --> 01:15.859
What would it be like
to have peace of mind?

01:20.620 --> 01:24.619
Proper calm?

01:27.700 --> 01:31.419
Where good things lap gently
again and again,

01:31.420 --> 01:35.419
like eventide
on the banks of a life?

01:55.500 --> 01:57.899
Instead of this...

01:57.900 --> 02:01.899
one death, one murder...

02:02.420 --> 02:05.899
hostage-taking...

02:05.900 --> 02:08.459
inconvenient truths,

02:08.460 --> 02:11.819
scurrilous lies...

02:11.820 --> 02:15.819
deviant sex.

02:16.780 --> 02:20.779
And it's not even Wednesday!

02:24.100 --> 02:28.099
What a week!

02:39.700 --> 02:43.699
That's excellent. Cheers.

02:46.020 --> 02:47.499
Just gonna go the bank, yeah?

02:47.500 --> 02:50.039
It's all right. I'll do it later,
after I've been to your mum's.

02:50.083 --> 02:51.882
You have to allow me something.

02:51.883 --> 02:54.522
I will... in time.

02:54.523 --> 02:57.842
But there was years, I didn't even
know the combination to the safe,

02:57.843 --> 03:00.682
let alone how much money we had,
or what accounts.

03:00.683 --> 03:04.682
You were all,
"It's better that you don't know."

03:04.803 --> 03:07.402
Well, it's the same now,
except I'm the one that knows.

03:07.403 --> 03:08.682
Don't worry about it.

03:08.683 --> 03:10.242
It's not easy.

03:10.243 --> 03:14.242
Think about it like...
the remote control for the telly,

03:14.643 --> 03:18.642
learn to let go.

03:27.363 --> 03:28.882
I've hardly slept.

03:28.883 --> 03:32.882
I'm not surprised, what a fuck-up!

03:33.243 --> 03:34.242
That's a big help.

03:34.243 --> 03:36.322
Patricia Finola?!

03:36.323 --> 03:38.162
Fuck off, Finola?

03:38.163 --> 03:41.842
She a trainee assistant pharmacist
and she's diagnosing people?

03:41.843 --> 03:44.282
What next, get the cleaner
to do the heart transplants?

03:44.283 --> 03:47.202
She's trying to be helpful.

03:47.203 --> 03:50.282
You know what she's like,
Little Miss Point-to-Prove.

03:50.283 --> 03:52.362
She meant well.

03:52.363 --> 03:56.362
This doesn't say she's terminal.
You've got to get a second opinion.

03:57.163 --> 04:00.082
Or a first. You are so fucked.

04:00.083 --> 04:01.802
Say that again
and I'll fucking hit ya!

04:01.803 --> 04:05.802
The problem we have is that
she thinks her bloods are clear.

04:08.563 --> 04:12.562
Somebody has to tell
the woman she's dying!

04:13.203 --> 04:15.322
I can't.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.762
I can't!

04:16.762 --> 04:18.041
No way! Fuck off!

04:18.043 --> 04:20.962
She'd never take it
off us young 'uns.

04:20.963 --> 04:22.322
She'll think we're taking the piss.

04:22.323 --> 04:23.762
What was it she called you?

04:23.763 --> 04:26.762
A yappy terrier in lip-stick
and a Wonderbra.

04:26.763 --> 04:28.562
Something like that.

04:28.563 --> 04:31.842
An under-sexed
petty criminal's moll,

04:31.843 --> 04:34.242
who really ought to wax more often

04:34.243 --> 04:36.602
if she wants to get away
with skirts that short.

04:36.603 --> 04:37.962
Patty never said that!

04:37.963 --> 04:40.282
Oh, no, that was me.

04:40.283 --> 04:44.282
And referring to yourselves as "the
young ones", is stretching it a bit.

04:44.763 --> 04:47.242
The pair of you could be
grandmothers round here.

04:47.243 --> 04:50.282
Have fun with the insults, Frank,
the woman is dying!

04:50.283 --> 04:54.282
We need your help.

04:55.203 --> 04:57.802
What's in it for me?

05:18.163 --> 05:20.922
Any Kola Nuts?

05:20.923 --> 05:22.602
Kola Nuts?

05:22.603 --> 05:26.202
I dunno.

05:26.203 --> 05:27.762
I had chin-chin in here as well.

05:27.763 --> 05:31.762
I had 'em last night, after tea.

05:31.843 --> 05:35.842
Let me know if you touch my stuff,
all right?

05:41.523 --> 05:43.562
'Are you sure you want to do this?'

05:43.563 --> 05:47.522
You keep stuff like this
for sentimental value,

05:47.523 --> 05:50.322
to hold onto a memory.

05:50.323 --> 05:54.122
I wanna make new memories with you,
baby.

05:54.123 --> 05:57.042
It'll take some time,
but you don't have to stay.

05:57.043 --> 06:00.002
Mint! There's a Killer tourney
on at the pub.

06:00.003 --> 06:01.322
D'you ever do any work?

06:01.323 --> 06:05.322
Why would I? We've got you.

06:08.003 --> 06:10.362
It's our first anniversary.

06:10.363 --> 06:14.362
Me and Billy
are gonna renew our vows, re-commit.

06:16.123 --> 06:20.122
I feel it's the right time
to... get shot of the past.

06:22.123 --> 06:26.122
I think it matters to you more
than it does to him.

06:33.243 --> 06:34.682
What you doing?

06:34.683 --> 06:36.882
Have you seen this?

06:36.883 --> 06:38.642
It's a flower.

06:38.643 --> 06:41.722
It's a fucking orchid!

06:41.723 --> 06:45.722
How does an orchid flourish
in a concrete shit-hole like this?!

06:50.283 --> 06:52.242
No!

06:52.243 --> 06:55.722
Aw, look at ya. Speechless.

06:55.723 --> 06:59.722
You're welcome.

07:00.603 --> 07:02.482
This was growing out the back.

07:02.483 --> 07:06.482
Never mind that weed,
come and have a gander at these.

07:11.403 --> 07:15.042
My dad!

07:15.043 --> 07:18.082
Check me!
Looking up at him like, "My hero!"

07:19.963 --> 07:21.282
I've never seen these.

07:21.283 --> 07:23.082
Keep them.

07:23.083 --> 07:25.602
Tragic waste, your father.

07:25.603 --> 07:29.122
Could've been anything, that lad,
but he threw it all away.

07:29.123 --> 07:31.922
He was a weak person, you know?

07:31.923 --> 07:35.082
Every family has one, he was ours.

07:35.083 --> 07:37.442
I don't think that's fair.

07:37.443 --> 07:39.522
You weren't born,
you weren't there!

07:39.523 --> 07:43.122
He had every opportunity in life,
our Kenny,

07:43.123 --> 07:46.882
but he was
as weak as that fucking weed.

07:46.883 --> 07:50.882
Aw!

07:57.803 --> 08:00.922
Every house in the fecking street
is getting one!

08:00.923 --> 08:04.922
I am fed up of cleaning dog dirt
from my wheels.

08:08.243 --> 08:11.402
You know, in Holland,

08:11.403 --> 08:15.402
it is considered a breach
of human rights to leave dog shit
on the public highway.

08:16.803 --> 08:18.722
A civilised country.

08:18.723 --> 08:22.722
And I can understand
why they acquiesced to the Nazis,

08:23.883 --> 08:25.802
you know, the Dutch.

08:25.803 --> 08:28.762
Why fight,
when you've no chance of winning.

08:28.763 --> 08:32.761
You're dying!

08:40.722 --> 08:44.722
The blood tests
and all that... bollocks,

08:47.363 --> 08:51.362
it's real.

08:52.603 --> 08:54.802
I know that.

08:54.803 --> 08:57.122
I'm no fool.

08:57.123 --> 09:01.122
I've felt it in me a long while.
Only question was when.

09:01.963 --> 09:04.562
Why didn't you go and see a doctor,
you daft old bint!

09:04.563 --> 09:08.122
You've got God's Own Pharmacist next
door feeling personally responsible.

09:08.123 --> 09:10.842
Why would that woman matter to me?!

09:10.843 --> 09:14.362
This is the best use of the time
you have left, is it? Dog shit?!

09:14.363 --> 09:16.082
Well, what would you have me do?!

09:16.083 --> 09:20.082
Sit here and consider
my imminent death?

09:20.083 --> 09:24.082
Or consider my many faults
and failings?

09:26.803 --> 09:30.802
Physically, things already have
begun to get more difficult.

09:35.683 --> 09:39.682
Yeah, well, you know,
if there's anything we can do...

09:40.243 --> 09:42.962
getting you more comfortable
and all that.

09:44.843 --> 09:48.842
I'm not good
with colostomies though.

09:52.523 --> 09:56.522
There is only one final request
I would make.

09:58.563 --> 10:03.931
I would like to see Ireland
one last time.

10:08.338 --> 10:10.337
I wouldn't. Having detested
the place her whole life,

10:10.381 --> 10:14.380
she now wants to return,
kiss the soil.

10:16.741 --> 10:19.780
Well, I would dip
into my savings, you know,

10:19.781 --> 10:23.780
but they are conspicuous in the
sense that they don't fucking exist.

10:24.141 --> 10:28.140
What if something happened
over there? We'd need to pay
to repatriate the body.

10:28.861 --> 10:32.540
Not like she's family.

10:32.541 --> 10:34.620
We really are strapped.

10:34.621 --> 10:38.180
A guilty conscience
only stretches so far, it seems.

10:39.741 --> 10:43.740
No, not this boy. Not any more.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.220
I'm financing Marty
at the moment, Frank.

10:49.312 --> 10:50.511
50 quid.

10:50.512 --> 10:52.311
That's not gonna
get you to Ireland.

10:52.312 --> 10:56.311
It's all I need.

11:00.192 --> 11:03.471
Right, get your hat and coat.
We leave in 20 minutes.

11:03.480 --> 11:04.959
I haven't packed.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.719
You won't need to.
And bring your bus pass.

11:07.720 --> 11:09.799
Where are you going?

11:09.801 --> 11:11.640
To get drugs.

11:11.641 --> 11:15.440
A bus to Ireland...
I will not go to Holyhead!

11:15.441 --> 11:19.440
I fecking hate the Welsh.

11:20.841 --> 11:24.840
Jesus Christ!
I nearly filled my thong.

11:25.321 --> 11:29.320
You all right?

11:29.881 --> 11:31.960
Karen?

11:31.961 --> 11:34.120
What do I do, G?

11:34.121 --> 11:38.120
A woman in my situation.

11:38.441 --> 11:41.600
What do I do?

11:41.601 --> 11:43.520
Look, keep your head, please.

11:43.521 --> 11:45.800
For what it's worth,
it was a mistake.

11:45.801 --> 11:48.600
Yeah.

11:48.601 --> 11:52.600
It was.

12:17.921 --> 12:21.480
This is getting old, you know.

12:21.481 --> 12:23.680
Flirty, hard to get,
flirty, hard to get.

12:23.681 --> 12:26.720
It's too high maintenance.

12:26.721 --> 12:30.720
What's going on?

12:35.161 --> 12:39.160
'One time.'

12:39.761 --> 12:43.760
I had sex with him, one time.

12:46.761 --> 12:50.760
A couple of months ago.
We were both drunk.

12:54.201 --> 12:56.040
It was just a stupid flirtation.

12:56.041 --> 12:58.440
I need to put a lid on it.

12:58.441 --> 13:00.960
I will.

13:00.961 --> 13:04.960
Me and your dad...

13:05.201 --> 13:08.440
are a bit lost.

13:08.441 --> 13:12.440
He doesn't know anything about this.

13:13.921 --> 13:16.560
Please don't say anything.

13:16.561 --> 13:20.560
You're going to lose him.

13:23.561 --> 13:27.560
Humiliating. Travelling
with the whole bunch of beggars.

13:27.681 --> 13:30.480
Just because they travel by bus
doesn't make them beggars,

13:30.481 --> 13:32.360
you miserable fucking crone.

13:32.361 --> 13:36.360
So, the fact that I don't like
the stench of urine makes me a snob?

13:36.961 --> 13:40.560
Why have you brought me
to this Godforsaken, dreary...

13:40.561 --> 13:43.800
Shut up and pay attention.

13:43.801 --> 13:47.800
To the left, Birkenhead.
To the right it's the... you know.

13:48.801 --> 13:52.800
Three legs, Isle of Man. Don't look
back, it's the House of Scouse.

13:53.081 --> 13:56.720
Steal your eyeballs
if you look directly at them.

13:56.721 --> 14:00.340
But there, straight ahead,
as the crow flies...

14:00.407 --> 14:02.406
Ireland.

14:02.449 --> 14:06.448
As I live and breathe.

14:15.169 --> 14:17.608
Something I could never work
out about your dad.

14:17.609 --> 14:21.608
Honestly, don't bother.
I thought I locked the door...?

14:22.769 --> 14:26.768
Always running away,
from Liverpool to London, to here,

14:27.529 --> 14:29.808
to Jockland, Australia,
New Zealand

14:29.809 --> 14:33.808
Yeah. Fresh starts,
trying to do the best by his family.

14:35.409 --> 14:38.608
You are aware
of the concept of privacy?

14:38.609 --> 14:40.888
Couldn't flee himself,
though, could he?

14:40.889 --> 14:44.088
Couldn't shake his own
inadequacies everywhere he went.

14:44.089 --> 14:46.728
He just needed a break.

14:46.729 --> 14:48.368
Broke our hearts, that's for sure.

14:48.369 --> 14:49.408
Addiction's an illness.

14:49.409 --> 14:52.408
It's indulgence
gone too far, then "boo-hoo-hoo"

14:52.409 --> 14:55.288
when the time comes to pay the price.

14:55.289 --> 14:58.368
Do you mind?
I'd like to get out now.

14:58.369 --> 14:59.888
Go ahead.

14:59.889 --> 15:01.328
What?!

15:01.329 --> 15:04.548
See, this is the legacy
from your dad.

15:04.592 --> 15:05.751
What is?

15:05.752 --> 15:08.351
This insecurity about your looks.

15:08.352 --> 15:12.111
You might be an ugly duckling,
but you'll blossom, mark me.

15:12.112 --> 15:16.111
Might not soon, but it'll come.

15:42.672 --> 15:43.951
Shall we go somewhere else?

15:43.952 --> 15:47.951
No, here's good.

15:55.112 --> 15:56.951
I was in a bad place.

15:56.952 --> 16:00.311
It never should've happened.
I'm sorry. Truly.

16:00.312 --> 16:03.831
It's not so much fucking my man,
cos men are stupid.

16:03.832 --> 16:06.711
But my little boy gets to see Mummy
and Daddy under different roofs,

16:06.712 --> 16:10.671
because some slapper
dangled her arse in his face?

16:10.672 --> 16:12.671
I'd have never split your family up.

16:12.672 --> 16:13.751
Why?

16:13.752 --> 16:17.751
Because Jamie didn't matter to you?
That's even more insulting.

16:17.952 --> 16:19.751
I cared about him.

16:19.752 --> 16:23.751
But...?

16:24.272 --> 16:27.831
There's someone else who matters
very much. It's complicated.

16:27.832 --> 16:28.871
Bollocks.

16:28.872 --> 16:29.991
Why would I lie?

16:29.992 --> 16:32.311
For sympathy, you scheming cow.

16:32.312 --> 16:35.951
You're like the star
of your own little tragedy, Gloria,

16:35.952 --> 16:39.951
you always have been.

16:44.712 --> 16:47.351
I'm sitting here...

16:47.352 --> 16:51.351
trying to think of the single
most perfect moment of my life.

16:54.472 --> 16:58.471
There's something more perfect
than a bag of chips by the seaside?

17:03.392 --> 17:07.391
Was it a moment with my daddy?

17:08.791 --> 17:12.550
Was it a lover, or a child?

17:12.551 --> 17:15.031
Or a beautiful place,

17:15.031 --> 17:19.031
or a wonderful evening?

17:19.791 --> 17:23.111
We used to measure enjoyment
by what you couldn't remember.

17:23.112 --> 17:27.111
Blacking out equalled a good night,
a direct correlation.

17:29.872 --> 17:31.791
What a fucking waste.

17:31.792 --> 17:35.791
Ah, now. No regrets.

17:35.872 --> 17:39.471
That really is a fecking waste.

17:39.472 --> 17:40.871
I think...

17:40.872 --> 17:44.871
it was the first time
I laid my naked breast

17:45.792 --> 17:49.791
against the bare flesh of a boy.

17:50.272 --> 17:54.271
It was so... exhilarating.

17:54.392 --> 17:55.831
You dark horse.

17:55.832 --> 17:57.791
Ah, no, not at all.

17:57.792 --> 18:01.511
There was no... clumsy groping,
no fumbling onwards,

18:01.512 --> 18:05.351
it was just that.

18:05.352 --> 18:06.591
15 years old, I was,

18:06.592 --> 18:10.351
with far too much
dreaming in my soul.

18:10.352 --> 18:14.351
It was absolutely pure.

18:16.032 --> 18:18.631
It was perfect.

18:18.632 --> 18:22.631
For me was when our Fiona was born.

18:27.472 --> 18:31.471
I went on a five-day bender,
straight from hospital.

18:32.632 --> 18:35.031
Ended up in Brighton.

18:35.032 --> 18:39.031
First time I ever took GBH.

18:41.832 --> 18:45.831
Best five days of my life.

18:49.592 --> 18:52.791
Could you...

18:52.792 --> 18:56.791
wheel me down, a bit closer?

19:19.752 --> 19:21.911
I can see it.

19:21.912 --> 19:23.471
It's 120 miles away.

19:23.472 --> 19:26.751
Superman couldn't see
Ireland from here.

19:26.752 --> 19:29.671
I can see it...

19:29.672 --> 19:33.671
smell it, taste it.

19:36.552 --> 19:40.311
Could you give me some time, please?

19:40.312 --> 19:43.951
Just an hour would be wonderful.

19:43.952 --> 19:47.631
Yeah.

19:47.632 --> 19:49.311
Thank you, Frank.

19:49.312 --> 19:51.511
Yeah, well, you know, whatever.

19:59.752 --> 20:02.831
Know what this is?

20:02.832 --> 20:06.111
Nope. I don't wanna know.

20:06.112 --> 20:08.991
What're are you being so cranky for?

20:08.992 --> 20:11.911
Nothing.

20:11.912 --> 20:15.871
I could just do without
the constant history lessons,

20:15.872 --> 20:18.071
all right?

20:18.072 --> 20:22.071
You can't just brush these things
under the carpet. It's unhealthy.

20:24.632 --> 20:28.631
I thought you were flinging
Paddy's things out...

20:28.872 --> 20:32.871
so that you and Billy can recommit
to your freak-show marriage.

20:34.432 --> 20:36.231
Say what you see, kiddo.

20:36.232 --> 20:39.711
Oh, I fucking will.

20:39.712 --> 20:43.471
You do.

20:43.472 --> 20:45.831
This is the journal

20:45.832 --> 20:49.831
they made your dad keep
during his third spell in rehab.

20:50.272 --> 20:52.191
I don't want to know.

20:52.192 --> 20:56.071
Where he talks about
how much he loves you.

20:56.072 --> 20:57.231
Pack it in.

20:57.232 --> 21:00.671
But not as much as
he loves the smack.

21:00.672 --> 21:03.191
Stop.

21:03.192 --> 21:07.191
He was a weak man,
who put my mother in an early grave.

21:08.152 --> 21:10.831
That is a fucking lie.

21:10.832 --> 21:14.831
Hard to think he had the same
genes as me and our Bobbi.

21:15.152 --> 21:19.151
It was you. It's your fucking fault.

21:19.592 --> 21:22.471
You were the reason that
his life went down the toilet.

21:22.472 --> 21:23.671
Bullshit.

21:23.672 --> 21:27.671
You got him on the drugs,
you took his livelihood off him...

21:27.752 --> 21:29.791
Livelihood? What livelihood?

21:29.792 --> 21:33.191
Everything that was Paddy Maguire's
was supposed to be my dad's.

21:33.192 --> 21:36.751
It was my dad's right,
it was his inheritance.

21:36.752 --> 21:39.591
And you gave it
to some scummy Irish fuck.

21:39.592 --> 21:42.511
Oh, you're deluded, kid.

21:42.512 --> 21:46.511
No, you're deluded, if you think you
can talk about my dad like that.

21:49.712 --> 21:52.431
You just can't keep
your mouth shut, can you?

21:52.432 --> 21:56.431
I practically beg you,
and you can't fucking stop.

21:56.952 --> 22:00.951
I have hated you my whole life...

22:03.432 --> 22:06.231
you fat, thieving,

22:06.232 --> 22:08.271
drug-dealing,

22:08.272 --> 22:11.391
murdering,

22:11.392 --> 22:15.391
abusive... Scouse... slag.

22:16.672 --> 22:20.671
I'm not fat. I'm a size 10.

22:25.392 --> 22:28.511
What's going on?

22:28.512 --> 22:32.511
You're weak. Just like your father.

22:32.672 --> 22:34.711
Up the stairs. Now.

22:34.712 --> 22:37.751
Please, please be careful.
We've got a party tomorrow.

22:37.752 --> 22:41.551
It's our anniversary.
Don't move.

22:41.552 --> 22:42.911
Up. Up!

22:42.912 --> 22:44.184
OK.

22:50.561 --> 22:52.000
Mam?

22:52.001 --> 22:53.280
See, I told you.

22:53.281 --> 22:57.280
If they take one step in this room,
I'll slice your carotid artery...

22:58.321 --> 23:00.080
that's the one
you don't recover from.

23:01.281 --> 23:02.680
Ruby, what's going on?

23:02.681 --> 23:05.400
I'm going to kill your mother,
as it happens.

23:05.401 --> 23:07.800
I don't have time
for this today, Ruby!

23:07.801 --> 23:11.280
I want to speak to her.
Well, you can't. She's indisposed.

23:11.281 --> 23:14.480
Send out an item of clothing,
so we know she's alive.

23:14.481 --> 23:18.280
How the fuck is an item of clothing
going to show us she's alive?

23:42.081 --> 23:43.960
Pint of lager, and two...

23:43.961 --> 23:47.960
Just a pint.

23:52.201 --> 23:54.120
I am, I'm at me Mam's.

23:54.121 --> 23:55.360
Let me speak to her, then.

23:55.361 --> 23:56.720
I can't, she's indisposed.

23:56.721 --> 23:58.000
Who else is there?

23:58.001 --> 24:00.840
Ruby, Billy...

24:00.841 --> 24:02.600
Well, let me speak to Ruby, then.

24:02.601 --> 24:03.880
I can't.

24:03.881 --> 24:05.120
What the fuck is going on?

24:05.121 --> 24:07.080
It's hard to explain.

24:07.081 --> 24:07.920
Don't lie.

24:07.921 --> 24:09.640
'I'm telling the truth.'

24:09.641 --> 24:11.920
This is ridiculous,
you've got to trust me.

24:13.841 --> 24:17.840
Listen, babe, I need to go.
I'll call you later, yeah?

24:23.001 --> 24:24.480
I know what I'm going to do.

24:24.481 --> 24:26.920
I'm going to ask your dad
to marry me.

24:26.921 --> 24:29.040
I can't take any more secrets.

24:29.041 --> 24:31.720
No, we're already married,
dummy, I'm going to ask him

24:31.721 --> 24:32.920
to renew our vows.

24:32.921 --> 24:36.640
And I'm going to do it properly -
down on one knee, propose, the lot.

24:36.641 --> 24:39.600
Maybe we can go on honeymoon, as
we didn't get the first time around.

24:39.601 --> 24:41.560
How are you going to pay for it all?

24:41.561 --> 24:44.680
We're doing all right,
between him and me.

24:44.681 --> 24:48.680
At least it's something.

24:53.361 --> 24:55.080
What's all this about, Ruby?

24:55.081 --> 24:58.520
It's about putting right
30 years of lies.

24:58.521 --> 25:02.240
About finally being free
to get on with my life.

25:02.241 --> 25:04.560
You're not going kill her.

25:04.561 --> 25:08.560
Come on,
you'd have done it already.

25:12.441 --> 25:15.880
This little bitch has cut my face,
Jamie! I want her hurt!

25:15.881 --> 25:19.880
You're not helping, Mam!

25:23.121 --> 25:25.160
You all right, babe?
I spoke to the priest.

25:25.161 --> 25:29.160
He's scared shitless,
but he is coming.

25:29.561 --> 25:32.520
You know, I don't think
they're taking me seriously.

25:32.521 --> 25:36.520
Why would they?

25:37.761 --> 25:41.280
Fair point.

25:42.561 --> 25:43.880
Mam!

25:51.601 --> 25:53.960
Unusual to see you out
the pub at this time of day.

25:53.961 --> 25:56.040
Well, I had a horse.

25:56.041 --> 25:59.960
I spoke to Karen,
told her I had someone else

25:59.961 --> 26:02.840
in my life,
but she didn't buy it.

26:02.841 --> 26:05.480
Why would she?

26:05.481 --> 26:07.960
Would it help the equilibrium
if I go and ride Karen?

26:07.961 --> 26:09.600
Even things up a bit?

26:09.601 --> 26:11.720
It's not funny.

26:11.721 --> 26:14.920
She really frightened me.

26:14.921 --> 26:18.360
Are you coming home later?

26:18.361 --> 26:22.360
Maybe.

26:41.521 --> 26:45.520
Ruby, talk to me.

26:51.801 --> 26:55.800
Time for another quick one.

28:40.321 --> 28:44.320
Our granddad did a bit of local
lending, some money on the streets

28:44.361 --> 28:46.080
in Toxteth, looked after some doors,

28:46.081 --> 28:49.520
did a bit of security -
small stuff, in the '70s.

28:49.521 --> 28:52.440
I know the legend,
me mam's told me often enough.

28:52.441 --> 28:55.440
Yeah, well, it should have gone
to my dad, he was the oldest.

28:55.441 --> 28:58.880
But no, no, Paddy and your ma
introduced him to smack,

28:58.881 --> 29:01.760
and he never shook it.
So they just took what was his.

29:01.761 --> 29:05.320
That was another time, another city.

29:05.321 --> 29:09.280
Well it's here
and fucking now, for me!

29:09.281 --> 29:10.720
I had this all down

29:10.721 --> 29:14.720
to some female pre-menstrual thing.
I see I was wrong. What's your
master plan, then, eh?

29:15.841 --> 29:19.200
What's your exit strategy?

29:19.201 --> 29:20.640
I just lost my temper.

29:20.641 --> 29:24.200
Jamie, get a lick on.

29:24.201 --> 29:28.200
This idiot stabbed me in the leg
and I've lost a lot of blood.

29:30.241 --> 29:32.040
You haven't got the fucking balls.

29:32.041 --> 29:35.200
I have nothing to lose.

29:35.201 --> 29:37.560
Is she talking? I heard her talking.

29:37.561 --> 29:40.160
Don't go leaping off tall buildings
just yet. Calm down.

29:40.161 --> 29:44.160
I heard you, babe. Everything's set
for tomorrow. I got the cup-cakes.

29:44.241 --> 29:46.440
Cup cakes?

29:46.441 --> 29:50.440
Important anniversary - the first.

29:52.081 --> 29:53.560
Congratulations.

29:54.601 --> 29:56.520
Mimi, talk to me, babe!

29:56.521 --> 30:00.520
Mimi!

30:03.041 --> 30:05.120
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

30:05.121 --> 30:07.040
I needed a word in private.

30:07.041 --> 30:11.040
You've crossed the line.

30:11.441 --> 30:15.440
If it makes you feel any better,
you and me could fuck right now...

30:19.241 --> 30:21.680
even the score up with your husband.

30:21.681 --> 30:24.680
Dream on.

30:24.681 --> 30:27.800
The human heart, physical desire,

30:27.801 --> 30:31.680
takes us all to places
that we didn't think we'd go.

30:31.681 --> 30:34.880
That's the beauty of it,
the wonder of it.

30:34.881 --> 30:38.720
Oh, that's very handy - a 'get out
of jail free' card. "It's not me,

30:38.721 --> 30:40.480
"it's my fucking libido."

30:40.481 --> 30:43.960
Come on, Karen, you're not
lily-white, none of us are.

30:43.961 --> 30:47.800
My dark heart takes me places
it shouldn't, on a daily basis.

30:47.801 --> 30:51.800
Like my bedroom?

30:55.681 --> 30:59.320
You need to get off
my sister's back.

30:59.321 --> 31:03.320
She's trying to make a future.

31:04.601 --> 31:07.200
I need you to leave.

31:07.201 --> 31:11.200
Now!

31:31.641 --> 31:35.640
All right, all right! Give me
50 grand and I'll let her go.

31:35.801 --> 31:37.840
We don't have 50 grand!
Just come out!

31:37.841 --> 31:40.800
Your dad was a rotten,
fucking junkie,

31:40.801 --> 31:43.120
long before Paddy
came on the scene.

31:43.121 --> 31:46.560
Bullshit.

31:46.561 --> 31:48.640
That's why your granddad
didn't pass his shit on.

31:48.641 --> 31:50.080
He'd have smoked it all away.

31:50.081 --> 31:54.080
Paddy Maguire might be an arse,
in many ways,

31:55.361 --> 31:58.200
but he did everything
he could for our Kenny.

31:58.201 --> 32:01.720
That is a fucking lie!

32:01.721 --> 32:04.880
Your dad was on the brown
since his teens.

32:04.881 --> 32:08.880
Mam, we'll have you
out there in no time, yeah?

32:09.041 --> 32:13.040
I can't stay here.

32:18.121 --> 32:20.760
Ruby!!!

32:31.081 --> 32:35.080
Do you think she's faking it?

32:42.641 --> 32:46.640
I said to Karen, "My dark heart
takes me places it shouldn't."

32:46.641 --> 32:47.920
Shut up!

32:47.921 --> 32:49.720
I fucking did!

32:49.721 --> 32:51.520
You sound like a pirate.

32:51.521 --> 32:54.280
Might've thought you were going to
make her walk the plank.

32:54.281 --> 32:56.240
Never heard it called that before.

32:56.241 --> 32:57.320
Fuck off!

32:57.321 --> 32:58.640
You fuck off!

33:00.481 --> 33:04.480
You can't go barging into women's
bedrooms, defending my honour,

33:04.881 --> 33:07.120
just cos someone casts a glance.

33:07.121 --> 33:11.120
Thank you.

33:13.521 --> 33:17.240
I also said that you're trying
to build yourself a future.

33:17.241 --> 33:19.720
Are you?

33:19.721 --> 33:23.720
Is it love? Proper love?

33:26.801 --> 33:30.800
I'm absolutely,
completely sure it is.

33:30.841 --> 33:34.400
It's not a mistake?

33:34.401 --> 33:38.400
No.

33:40.881 --> 33:42.475
Then, carry on.

34:09.253 --> 34:13.252
I've shut up shop.
Wanted a lock-in, but...

34:14.406 --> 34:17.284
I can't get used to that.

34:17.286 --> 34:19.844
She looks really peaceful.

34:19.846 --> 34:21.245
She's fucking dead.

34:21.246 --> 34:23.205
It was an accident.

34:23.206 --> 34:26.925
Maybe for the best - troubled girl.

34:26.926 --> 34:29.005
I could've made her happy.

34:29.005 --> 34:31.324
Not enough she's your cousin -
now it's necrophilia?

34:31.326 --> 34:33.005
Uh, "could've" - past tense.

34:33.005 --> 34:35.245
She can still make you happy.

34:35.246 --> 34:36.844
Enough!

34:36.846 --> 34:40.844
Mam, what's the plan?

34:42.326 --> 34:45.364
Could be the loss of blood,
but I'm fucking starving.

34:45.366 --> 34:46.725
I can make you a cheese toastie.

34:46.726 --> 34:49.165
Nah, not dairy products, mate -
not with that wound.

34:49.166 --> 34:51.485
Could turn her stomach,
and if she starts puking up,

34:51.485 --> 34:53.245
as well as her blood loss...

34:53.246 --> 34:55.885
I meant,
what's the plan with the body...

34:55.886 --> 34:58.445
the corpse of the cousin
sitting on the chair?

34:58.446 --> 35:01.925
She's run away with her boyfriend,
hasn't she?

35:01.926 --> 35:05.325
Shallow grave -
somewhere joggers won't go,

35:05.326 --> 35:09.325
but foxes and badgers will,
once they catch the scent.

35:31.846 --> 35:35.845
Don't.

35:55.086 --> 35:58.445
Did you sleep all right?

35:58.446 --> 36:02.445
Mm.

36:02.646 --> 36:06.085
I need to get started.

36:06.086 --> 36:10.085
I've got clients to see.

36:42.246 --> 36:45.245
What's with all the cloak and dagger
at this time in the morning?

36:45.246 --> 36:46.965
See for yourself.

36:46.966 --> 36:48.645
If this is a joke...

36:48.646 --> 36:52.645
No joke.

36:55.126 --> 36:59.125
JESUS CHRIST!

37:00.326 --> 37:01.365
You murdered her?

37:01.366 --> 37:03.885
No, I didn't.

37:03.886 --> 37:07.885
She stabbed Mam,
took a tumble out the window.

37:09.086 --> 37:10.885
Three witnesses, swear to God.

37:10.886 --> 37:13.445
And since you're making
all the decisions now,

37:13.446 --> 37:17.445
I thought you might have a plan.

37:22.486 --> 37:26.485
I think we're a better team when we
share responsibility, don't you?

37:40.486 --> 37:44.485
Oh, fuck.

37:44.926 --> 37:46.805
Oh...

37:46.806 --> 37:50.805
Oh, fuck.

38:22.526 --> 38:25.125
Patty!

38:25.126 --> 38:27.045
Patty?

38:27.046 --> 38:31.045
Patty!

38:31.206 --> 38:35.205
Patty!

38:37.686 --> 38:41.685
Pa...

38:41.726 --> 38:45.725
Oh, fuck. No.

39:05.406 --> 39:07.965
Fucking...

39:07.966 --> 39:11.965
Scouse tide.

39:29.726 --> 39:32.925
Well, I hope you made it.

39:32.926 --> 39:34.885
You mad...

39:34.886 --> 39:38.885
fucking crone.

39:52.326 --> 39:54.485
Just like that - up and gone?

39:54.486 --> 39:57.765
Yeah. Her and the fella,
ne'er so much as a backward glance.

39:57.766 --> 39:59.365
Yeah, but who was he?

39:59.366 --> 40:01.605
Seemed to know her from long ago...

40:01.606 --> 40:05.525
come over to take her back
to the old Emerald thing.

40:05.526 --> 40:09.285
To think of the minutes and seconds
I've wasted feeling sorry for her.

40:09.286 --> 40:12.245
Though not so sorry you'd
stump up for a ferry trip.

40:12.246 --> 40:15.045
Oh... How long are you
going to milk this?

40:15.046 --> 40:18.765
As long as I can.

40:18.766 --> 40:20.725
To Patty.

40:20.726 --> 40:22.645
I've got a frock to get into.

40:22.646 --> 40:24.965
You're not still
going ahead with that?

40:24.966 --> 40:28.965
After the 48 hours I've had -
bet your fucking life.

40:30.126 --> 40:34.125
About the frock...

40:38.446 --> 40:40.685
You lying cunt.

40:40.686 --> 40:44.245
It's how she would have wanted it.

40:44.246 --> 40:45.565
Tell me she's all right.

40:45.566 --> 40:49.565
She's all right.

40:50.926 --> 40:53.965
I'll miss her, you know.

40:53.966 --> 40:57.965
Nice to have the living room back.

41:11.406 --> 41:15.405
Hello?

41:17.166 --> 41:20.365
They have to leave you
one light per room - by law.

41:20.366 --> 41:24.365
Who has?

41:32.086 --> 41:36.085
Court-appointed bailiffs.

41:36.526 --> 41:38.285
How much?

41:38.286 --> 41:42.285
Everything - house included.

41:42.686 --> 41:46.485
We have to vacate by tomorrow.

41:46.486 --> 41:49.085
You should've told me.

41:49.086 --> 41:53.085
You were too busy fucking
your little pharmacy pal.

41:53.086 --> 41:56.405
Calum, is it?

41:56.406 --> 41:58.005
Our time's up, baby...

41:58.006 --> 42:00.285
you don't want me,
I don't want you...

42:00.286 --> 42:01.525
this is just a symptom.

42:01.526 --> 42:02.765
Please don't...

42:02.766 --> 42:05.205
It's a good thing.

42:05.206 --> 42:08.885
Don't fight it.

42:08.886 --> 42:12.885
Sorted the admin,
so it's on me, mostly.

42:12.966 --> 42:16.965
Where are you going?

42:17.566 --> 42:21.565
I'm leaving, baby.

42:23.286 --> 42:25.565
I've got a lady.

42:25.566 --> 42:29.565
Her and me, we've got a chance.

42:31.086 --> 42:35.085
Who is she?

42:45.486 --> 42:49.485
I'll be in touch.

43:29.006 --> 43:30.805
I'm not sure about this.

43:30.806 --> 43:33.965
This is how much I love you -
I want to inhabit your skin.

43:33.966 --> 43:36.285
No, I mean...

43:36.286 --> 43:39.605
you've got a better figure than me
in that fucking dress.

43:39.606 --> 43:40.805
Can you see me black eye?

43:40.806 --> 43:41.885
No.

43:41.886 --> 43:43.845
See the cut on my cheek?

43:43.846 --> 43:46.005
It looks perfect.

43:46.006 --> 43:50.005
Ah well -
two out of three isn't bad.

43:51.246 --> 43:53.205
Better get this done quick.

43:53.206 --> 43:58.085
Same as the last year, Father.
But with a few modifications.

43:59.886 --> 44:02.765
I, William Tutton, take you...

44:02.766 --> 44:06.525
Katherine Mimi
Harmonica Joy Maguire...

44:06.526 --> 44:08.365
you taught me, nurtured me...

44:08.366 --> 44:12.165
I will respect and treasure you
with every atom of my being.

44:12.166 --> 44:16.165
Trust and love will ensure
we walk towards our futures

44:17.046 --> 44:19.205
together, as one...

44:19.206 --> 44:20.165
I will fuck no-one else.

44:21.806 --> 44:23.605
Nor will I.

44:23.606 --> 44:26.005
And should my jizz
ever dry up again...

44:27.486 --> 44:30.725
only I will milk you
back to health.

44:32.566 --> 44:36.565
I, again, pronounce you,
husband and wife.

44:38.526 --> 44:42.525
You may kiss the bride.

44:43.486 --> 44:47.485
Mimi! Mimi, are you all right?

44:49.486 --> 44:53.485
What would it be like
to have peace of mind?

44:57.846 --> 44:59.805
'Instead of this.

44:59.806 --> 45:03.765
'Death. Deviant sex.
Inconvenient truths.

45:03.766 --> 45:06.485
'One murder.
Vows exchanged and broken.

45:06.486 --> 45:10.485
'Scurrilous lies.
Hostage-taking.

45:12.086 --> 45:16.085
'What a week.

45:20.766 --> 45:22.565
'I'll miss the old place.

45:22.566 --> 45:26.565
'Underfed, unwashed, inbred,
skiving, scrounging,

45:28.686 --> 45:32.685
'leeching gobshites that they are,
every last one.

45:36.246 --> 45:40.245
'But then, they're our gobshites.
Are they not?'

46:38.366 --> 46:42.365
It's against the law, you know.

46:43.086 --> 46:45.165
Shagging dead people
is against the law.

46:45.166 --> 46:47.885
I wasn't going to... shag her. Jesus.

46:47.886 --> 46:48.925
No?

46:48.926 --> 46:51.885
Just...

46:51.886 --> 46:53.885
making sure
she was all right, wasn't I?

46:53.886 --> 46:56.232
Yeah. Sure you were.

46:56.726 --> 46:58.525
Now go on - get the fuck home.

46:58.526 --> 47:01.789
Come on, you dirty bastard.
She's your cousin.
