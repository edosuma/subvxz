<i>Everyone, have your money
ready. We only have so much time.</i>

00:47.013 --> 00:49.481
Okay, say, "Cheers!"
Cheers.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.141
Say, "Beer!"
Beer!

00:51.217 --> 00:52.616
Say, "Cheers!"

00:54.421 --> 00:56.082
Glen, you got to take
that shirt off, pal.

00:56.156 --> 00:57.180
Why?

00:57.257 --> 00:59.782
Hands, you wanna
field this one?

00:59.859 --> 01:01.588
Uh, dude, you're getting
a fake ID...

01:01.661 --> 01:03.595
...and you're wearing a shirt
that says you're in high school.

01:03.663 --> 01:04.822
So?

01:04.897 --> 01:07.025
Okay, whatever.
I'll fix it later.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.226
Just do
what you were doing.

01:08.301 --> 01:10.132
Give me
some nice cat things.

01:10.270 --> 01:11.737
<i>- B!
- Oh, hey, Schrader.</i>

01:11.805 --> 01:13.534
What the hell
is going on here?

01:13.606 --> 01:14.766
Relax, pal.

01:14.841 --> 01:16.069
Five percent goes
to your favorite charity.

01:16.142 --> 01:17.769
Uh, I forgot to tell you,
I borrowed your keys.

01:17.844 --> 01:19.812
You borrowed my keys?
Come on.

01:19.879 --> 01:21.107
Well, I needed them.
Ow.

01:21.181 --> 01:22.808
We're providing a vital
service to America's youth here.

01:22.882 --> 01:25.180
Could we get the next in line,
please? No, we're not. Stay there!

01:25.251 --> 01:27.219
We're contributing to
the delinquency of minors, B.

01:27.287 --> 01:29.255
<i>Do you know what will
happen to me if I get caught?</i>

01:29.322 --> 01:30.983
<i>Every day
after eighth period...</i>

01:31.057 --> 01:32.615
Vice Principal Matthews
comes in here.

01:32.692 --> 01:34.421
<i>He picks up
the women's fitness magazine...</i>

01:34.494 --> 01:36.485
<i>...and he snaps one off!</i>

01:36.563 --> 01:37.962
Are you serious?
Yes.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.020
That is a problem.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.124
Uh, okay, well, we still have
the rest of eighth period, right?

01:41.201 --> 01:42.793
So, we'll just pack everybody
up and get out of here.

01:42.869 --> 01:43.858
Okay, let's go!

01:45.405 --> 01:46.531
Shit!

01:51.144 --> 01:53.271
Gaines! Gaines! Gaines!

01:53.813 --> 01:55.075
Okay, good, good.

01:55.148 --> 01:57.548
Ah, wonderful!
Vice Principal Matthews!

01:57.617 --> 01:58.709
So glad you could join us!

01:58.785 --> 02:00.412
What the hell is this?

02:00.553 --> 02:01.884
It's Glee Club
practice, sir.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.822
We're just gettin' ready for
Memorial Day. It's a big one for us.

02:04.891 --> 02:06.586
We don't have
a Glee Club.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.018
Not yet,
we don't, sir.

02:08.094 --> 02:10.187
But as the graduating class,
we wanted to leave behind...

02:10.263 --> 02:12.254
...a legacy that inspires
future students...

02:12.332 --> 02:14.926
...to take initiative
rather than spend their time...

02:15.001 --> 02:17.902
I don't know, privately defacing
women's fitness magazines.

02:18.605 --> 02:19.799
I mean, I went
to read an article...

02:19.873 --> 02:21.932
...about no carbs and higher reps
the other day...

02:22.008 --> 02:23.339
...and the pages were...
You are a rotten egg.

02:23.409 --> 02:25.707
...as if by some natural
adhesive. That'll be enough.

02:25.778 --> 02:27.370
I need to cut
the pounds...

02:27.447 --> 02:28.846
...and I can't open the...
Stop it!

02:28.915 --> 02:30.815
Whatever does it for...
Stop it!

02:30.884 --> 02:32.476
That's all
I'm gonna say.

02:32.552 --> 02:34.383
Thank God
you're graduating.

02:36.122 --> 02:37.680
I'm the fourth-generation Schrader... Sorry.

02:37.757 --> 02:39.622
...to go to Harmon College, okay? Yeah.

02:39.692 --> 02:41.353
I can't do anything
to screw that up.

02:41.427 --> 02:44.021
You know, like, I don't know,
getting busted for identity fraud.

02:44.097 --> 02:46.429
Look at you.
Would you stop, man? Relax.

02:46.499 --> 02:47.898
We're all goin'
to college, okay?

02:47.967 --> 02:49.935
This is said by the guy
who's been rejected... Hey, B.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.027
...by seven schools.

02:51.104 --> 02:52.696
Hey, I'm creating
dramatic tension.

02:52.772 --> 02:54.569
I got a good feeling
about number eight! Ugh.

02:55.275 --> 02:59.302
I got in! I got in!
I got into Princeton!

02:59.379 --> 03:01.370
Yeah! Yeah!

03:02.749 --> 03:04.546
Hey, I think that guy
got into Princeton.

03:04.617 --> 03:05.845
Oh, what makes you say that?

03:05.919 --> 03:06.943
I don't know.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.180
Bartleby! Hey.

03:08.254 --> 03:10.085
Hey, how are you, Monica? Hey, how are you?

03:10.156 --> 03:12.056
Good. Do you know Schrader?

03:12.125 --> 03:14.559
No, I don't think so. Oh!
Yes! We...

03:15.328 --> 03:17.023
I actually...
We had a class.

03:17.096 --> 03:18.120
Oh, yeah.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.393
My shit was all crazy.
I sat way behind you.

03:20.466 --> 03:22.696
Yeah. Sorry. I don't remember you, either.

03:22.769 --> 03:23.895
Sorry.
It's all right.

03:23.970 --> 03:26.336
Um, anyway, I really wanted
to ask you something.

03:26.406 --> 03:27.464
Sure, anything.

03:27.540 --> 03:28.598
Um, you know,
I know it's really late...

03:28.675 --> 03:29.972
...but, um, last minute
and everything...

03:30.043 --> 03:31.772
...but prom is coming up soon,
you know? It's okay. Yes.

03:31.844 --> 03:34.677
And I'm actually having a
party at my house beforehand.

03:34.747 --> 03:36.442
Awesome!
And I was wondering...

03:36.516 --> 03:39.349
...if you'd like to, um...
If you could, um...

03:39.419 --> 03:41.387
I'd love to.
... Mow our lawn.

03:42.555 --> 03:44.614
Mow your lawn?
Yeah.

03:44.691 --> 03:46.682
Oh.
I'm sorry.

03:47.460 --> 03:49.860
Yeah. I'm really embarrassed,
but, you know...

03:49.929 --> 03:52.056
...our mower's broken and my mom
was just, like, "Ask Bartleby!"

03:52.131 --> 03:53.155
That's cool!

03:53.233 --> 03:55.360
I... Yeah. Tell your mother I
would love to mow the lawn. Really?

03:55.435 --> 03:56.561
Of course.

03:56.636 --> 03:57.625
Thank you so much.
Yeah, sure.

03:57.704 --> 03:59.695
Thank you. Hey, babe!
Hey, yo, Monica! Come on!

03:59.772 --> 04:01.239
Sorry, I got to go.

04:01.307 --> 04:02.865
But thank you, again.
Yeah, s-sure.

04:02.942 --> 04:04.773
You're really helping us out.
Oh, great to see you.

04:04.844 --> 04:06.436
And, hey, it was nice to meet,
um, see you. Talk to you.

04:06.512 --> 04:08.173
Yes, yes. It was... It was
so nice catching up with you.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.045
Yeah. Okay. Bye-bye.
B- Bye, Monica.

04:10.116 --> 04:11.583
Hey, I'm sorry
to keep you waiting, baby.

04:11.651 --> 04:13.812
Hoyt Ambrose. Hoyt!

04:13.886 --> 04:16.753
Hoyt Ambrose. What's that
guy got that I don't have?

04:16.822 --> 04:18.517
I just need to get a car.

04:19.892 --> 04:21.223
And classic good looks.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.802
"I regret... "

04:49.122 --> 04:51.488
I can't believe
I didn't get into State!

04:51.557 --> 04:52.922
I wasn't even aiming high
with that one.

04:52.992 --> 04:54.050
That was my fallback!

04:54.127 --> 04:56.152
It was my safety school,
my fail-safe!

04:56.229 --> 04:59.027
Maybe you're just
too average.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.258
Hey, time out.

05:00.333 --> 05:01.493
Too average?

05:01.868 --> 05:04.393
Okay. Okay.
Excuse me, Lizzie.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.028
R- R-Remember who
you're talkin' to here.

05:06.105 --> 05:07.402
I didn't have to go to gym class
for a whole year...

05:07.473 --> 05:08.906
'cause I claimed
to be allergic to sweat.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.569
Or what about the time I got the note
from my doctor saying I was nocturnal...

05:11.644 --> 05:13.236
...and I was allowed
to study in my dreams?

05:13.313 --> 05:15.907
I got the school bully, Frank
Daley, kicked out for two years...

05:15.982 --> 05:17.813
...because he was
sexually harassing me...

05:17.884 --> 05:20.318
...by pushing me up against the
locker and I said I felt something.

05:20.386 --> 05:22.217
I mean, come on.
That was pure genius.

05:22.288 --> 05:25.587
Maybe if you didn't write an essay
called "I Don't Have a Clue. "

05:25.658 --> 05:26.852
Well, it's true. You know?

05:26.926 --> 05:28.894
I don't have a clue what I want
to do with the rest of my life.

05:28.961 --> 05:30.622
Mom and Dad
are gonna kill you.

05:30.697 --> 05:32.130
O ye of little faith.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.425
They're not gonna kill me.
Uh-huh.

05:34.634 --> 05:35.692
I just have to spin it...

05:35.768 --> 05:37.759
...and put it in terms
they can understand.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.168
I don't understand.

05:39.238 --> 05:41.035
I don't understand, either.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.899
Okay, I figure it
like this.

05:42.975 --> 05:45.603
The average cost of college
is, what, $20,000 a year?

05:45.678 --> 05:47.578
Now, according to these estimates
that I got off the Web...

05:47.647 --> 05:49.012
You can pass those around.

05:49.082 --> 05:50.572
Someone with no education
beyond high school...

05:50.650 --> 05:53.642
...can expect to make about $20,000
a year in the current job market.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.779
Now, that being said,
over the next four years...

05:55.855 --> 05:58.881
...you could either
spend $80,000

05:58.958 --> 06:01.426
...or I could make $80,000.

06:02.628 --> 06:04.823
Are you saying
you don't want to go to college?

06:04.897 --> 06:07.263
No. I'm saying that
it is fiscally irresponsible...

06:07.333 --> 06:09.426
...for me to go
to college. You know?

06:09.635 --> 06:11.728
Are you huffing?
Oh, God. No.

06:11.804 --> 06:13.704
Are you high?
You're huffing grass?

06:13.773 --> 06:16.264
No. I'm not huffing, Mom. I'm
not stoned. I'm completely fine.

06:16.342 --> 06:18.936
In fact, I'm more clear and
level-headed than I've ever been.

06:19.011 --> 06:21.104
Okay, cut the crap,
Bartleby.

06:21.180 --> 06:22.579
Society has rules.

06:22.882 --> 06:25.646
And the first rule is
you go to college. Mmm-hmm.

06:25.718 --> 06:28.346
You want to have a happy and
successful life? You go to college.

06:28.421 --> 06:30.412
If you want to be somebody,
you go to college.

06:30.490 --> 06:32.651
If you want to fit in,
you go to college.

06:32.725 --> 06:35.250
Well, you know what? Maybe
I didn't get into college.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.294
What do you mean?

06:47.173 --> 06:49.107
I didn't get accepted
anywhere.

06:49.609 --> 06:51.201
Oh, Bartleby.

06:51.277 --> 06:52.266
Damn it.

06:52.345 --> 06:55.872
I knew he should've started
preparing for college in junior high...

06:55.948 --> 06:57.245
...like his sister.

06:57.316 --> 06:59.443
Now, she's got a shot.
I've got a shot.

06:59.519 --> 07:00.781
She's got a shot.
Listen, guys.

07:00.853 --> 07:03.014
There are plenty of successful
people who didn't go to college.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.886
Albert Einstein,
you know.

07:04.957 --> 07:07.016
Pocahontas never
went to college.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.890
Corey Feldman
and Corey Haim.

07:08.961 --> 07:10.087
They had a great run.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.721
Both Lewis and Clark.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.660
Suzanne Somers. Bono.

07:14.867 --> 07:16.960
I need to go
check on the cobbler.

07:19.005 --> 07:20.905
"Check the cobbler. "
Glug, glug, glug.

07:21.240 --> 07:24.641
You know, I really don't care
what Sonny Bono did or didn't do.

07:25.144 --> 07:26.577
You're goin' to college.

07:30.983 --> 07:32.450
I told you so.

07:32.518 --> 07:33.815
You were adopted.

07:35.755 --> 07:36.949
Everyone...

07:37.023 --> 07:40.049
I would like to propose
a toast to our graduates.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.787
To the Class of 2006...

07:41.861 --> 07:44.056
...may the next four years
of college...

07:44.130 --> 07:46.030
...be the best years
of your life.

07:46.098 --> 07:47.497
Hear, hear.
Mom.

07:48.901 --> 07:50.835
Hey.
Hey, man, what's up?

07:50.903 --> 07:53.201
What's up, B? How you doin'? What's up?

07:53.372 --> 07:55.169
Dude, I swear,
if one more person tells me...

07:55.241 --> 07:57.505
...how excited they are to go
to college, I'm gonna lose it.

07:57.577 --> 07:58.976
Oh, man, I heard about the scholarship.

07:59.045 --> 08:01.536
That's insane. You're one of
the best receivers in the state.

08:01.614 --> 08:04.242
Uh, the best. And, uh,
no knee, no football, man.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.285
That sucks.
What are you gonna do now?

08:06.552 --> 08:08.543
I have no idea.

08:09.055 --> 08:10.545
That makes two of us, pal.

08:10.623 --> 08:12.648
It's fine, it's fine, it's
fine, it's fine, it's fine.

08:12.725 --> 08:15.660
Hey, Rory. What's goin' on?
Oh, hey. What? Fine. Nothing.

08:15.728 --> 08:17.992
Um, I... I didn't get into Yale.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.927
I did... I didn't,
I didn't get into Yale.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.626
I didn't...
I didn't get into Yale.

08:21.701 --> 08:23.498
What? I can't
believe that!

08:23.569 --> 08:25.901
Well, there's no room
for Rory at Yale.

08:25.972 --> 08:27.769
Too many rich kids
with mediocre grades...

08:27.840 --> 08:30.001
...and well-connected parents
this year, I guess.

08:30.076 --> 08:31.634
No room for Rory,
who's been working...

08:31.711 --> 08:33.303
...since first grade
to get into Yale.

08:33.379 --> 08:35.539
Rory, who only applied
to Yale and nowhere else.

08:35.615 --> 08:36.808
I had it all planned!

08:36.883 --> 08:39.283
It was perfect, B!
Perfect!

08:39.852 --> 08:41.979
<i>And now
it's nothing! Nada!</i>

08:42.355 --> 08:43.720
It's a goose egg!

08:44.155 --> 08:45.851
Okay. Well.

08:46.425 --> 08:48.120
God, Rory! Rory!

08:49.929 --> 08:51.521
She's handling that
really well.

08:51.597 --> 08:53.462
College
is for pussies!

08:53.599 --> 08:55.464
All right. I got to get out of here, pal.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.968
Hang in there.
All right, man. You, too.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.732
Bartleby! Hey! Oh, hey, Mr.
Schrader. I was actually just...

08:59.805 --> 09:00.829
Did you have any cake?

09:00.907 --> 09:02.397
No, you know, I'm not much of a cake guy.

09:02.475 --> 09:03.533
Oh, it is a hell
of a cake.

09:03.609 --> 09:06.578
It is the same cake we got for Scotty
and Seth when they got into Harmon.

09:06.646 --> 09:08.170
Oh, ah, everything
comes full circle.

09:08.247 --> 09:10.272
Jay! How are ya, bud?
Oh, I really don't...

09:10.349 --> 09:11.646
Hey, Stu.
Hey.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.480
I can't imagine your pride,
knowing your youngest...

09:13.553 --> 09:15.953
...is headed off to a good
college. Must take a load off.

09:16.022 --> 09:17.250
Yeah, well, not to mention...

09:17.323 --> 09:19.587
...the load it takes off
my bank account.

09:21.794 --> 09:22.783
Dad.

09:22.862 --> 09:24.625
Nothin' like gettin'
a load off!

09:26.966 --> 09:28.399
What about you,
Bartleby?

09:28.935 --> 09:30.903
That's a good question,
Mr. Harkin.

09:31.971 --> 09:34.201
What's with the questions,
Mr. Trebek?

09:34.941 --> 09:36.568
Where you goin'?

09:38.144 --> 09:40.442
Um, I... I., well...

09:41.514 --> 09:43.038
I didn't really, uh...

09:43.115 --> 09:45.675
Bartleby screwed around and
now he's not goin' to college.

09:45.751 --> 09:47.412
He's thrown his life away.

09:53.693 --> 09:56.161
Yeah, that's... That's what
I was gonna say. Thanks, Dad.

10:45.511 --> 10:48.412
Wait. South Harmon
Institute of Technology?

10:48.481 --> 10:51.507
Yeah. B, you realize that
makes it S.H.I.T., right?

10:51.851 --> 10:54.251
S.H.I.T.?
I was wingin' it. Whatever.

10:54.353 --> 10:56.014
Just finish building
the website, please.

10:56.088 --> 10:59.785
This is the act of a desperate,
wildly unrealistic person.

10:59.859 --> 11:02.589
Yo, B, you have to hook me up with
one of these acceptance letters, bro.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.721
Are you kidding me? No way.
Why not?

11:04.797 --> 11:07.527
Oh, come on. The only way this is
gonna work is if we keep it quiet.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.090
And even then,
it's still a long shot.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.295
Dude, I don't care.
I have to do somethin'.

11:11.370 --> 11:12.428
The minute
I lost my scholarship...

11:12.505 --> 11:15.133
...my pop started talkin' about
me getting my own bus route.

11:15.207 --> 11:16.640
Help me. Please?
Mmm.

11:18.177 --> 11:19.667
You know something?

11:19.745 --> 11:22.373
For the safety of the public,
I can't let you drive a bus.

11:22.448 --> 11:23.642
Sweet.
But listen to me.

11:23.716 --> 11:25.513
This is just a temporary
stopgap measure, okay?

11:25.584 --> 11:27.108
Nothing more.
Gotcha.

11:27.186 --> 11:29.654
Bravo, guys. Great.
Both of you guys.

11:29.722 --> 11:32.782
Let's start this fake college. And then
we'll go start a meth lab somewhere.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.792
Come on. It's a gateway crime. What?

11:34.860 --> 11:35.884
That's how these things start.

11:35.961 --> 11:37.292
You know something, Schrader...

11:37.363 --> 11:38.830
...you got into
a great college.

11:38.898 --> 11:40.263
And your future's
lookin' really good...

11:40.332 --> 11:43.062
...and I'm psyched for you, pal, 'cause
you're my best friend and I love you.

11:43.135 --> 11:46.764
I'm talking about me coming
to you, asking for your help.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.703
Just finish
the damn website.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.364
Please.

11:53.179 --> 11:54.339
What do you say?

11:54.413 --> 11:56.108
There he is!
Fine.

11:56.182 --> 11:57.911
Get off me,
you idiot.

11:57.983 --> 12:00.247
But we need some sort of, like,
mission statement or something.

12:00.319 --> 12:02.913
Your dad's gonna want to see
that. I know him, he's a hard-ass.

12:03.756 --> 12:04.984
Hey, kids. Honey!

12:05.057 --> 12:06.957
Hey. Hi. How are you? Hey.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.084
What's this?

12:09.161 --> 12:11.595
South Harmon Institute of Technology?
What's that?

12:11.664 --> 12:13.291
Mmm? What's that?

12:13.365 --> 12:16.232
One of the most respected schools
in the area, that's what that is.

12:16.302 --> 12:17.394
Well, what's it say?

12:17.470 --> 12:18.869
I gotta open it first.

12:18.938 --> 12:20.303
Come on, hurry.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.400
Oh. I'm nervous.

12:26.879 --> 12:28.437
"Dear Bartleby...

12:29.915 --> 12:32.315
"congratulations,
you've been accepted!"

12:32.384 --> 12:33.612
I got in!

12:33.686 --> 12:36.154
Aw, thank God. Thank God.
I got in!

12:36.255 --> 12:37.586
Hey-o!
Oh! God!

12:37.656 --> 12:38.816
Honey.
I'm okay.

12:38.891 --> 12:41.223
Hey, this is great!

12:41.293 --> 12:42.317
It's so exciting!

12:42.394 --> 12:45.158
What the hell is South Harmon
Institute of Technology? Yeah.

12:45.231 --> 12:46.630
Oh, it's one of
Harmon College's sister schools.

12:46.699 --> 12:48.599
I've never heard of it.

12:49.135 --> 12:50.796
Well, because
it's the baby sister.

12:50.870 --> 12:53.737
It's the most discreet and
unharmed of the sister schools.

12:53.806 --> 12:55.364
You got any literature
on this place?

12:55.441 --> 12:57.807
Yeah, there's a website,
I'll show you the link.

12:58.477 --> 13:00.502
You did it.
You're a college boy.

13:00.646 --> 13:01.874
Wow.

13:02.014 --> 13:04.346
So you guys want to eat?
Yeah.

13:10.923 --> 13:13.289
Hey! I hate my life.

13:13.359 --> 13:15.088
I'm a huge tool.

13:15.161 --> 13:16.355
Have fun being hot.

13:16.428 --> 13:17.417
Bartleby!

13:18.297 --> 13:20.060
Hey, Dad, what's up?

13:20.766 --> 13:21.994
I took a look
at that website.

13:22.067 --> 13:23.261
Oh.

13:23.469 --> 13:24.527
Cool.

13:24.603 --> 13:25.661
It looks unreal.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.171
Unreal?

13:27.239 --> 13:29.673
Yeah, it looks
pretty unbelievable, huh?

13:30.376 --> 13:31.741
It seems
like a solid place.

13:31.811 --> 13:32.800
Really?

13:32.878 --> 13:34.175
Here you go.

13:37.216 --> 13:39.616
First semester's tuition.
Paid in full.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.283
That's great.

13:42.354 --> 13:44.254
Wow, thank you, Dad.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.122
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.158
Thanks, Dad.

13:49.862 --> 13:52.126
Your mother and I
can't wait to drop you off.

13:57.136 --> 13:59.104
What we need to do
is lease a place near Harmon...

13:59.171 --> 14:00.604
...so we can fool our parents.
Yeah.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.836
Hey, Schrad, do you know any
places up near Harmon we can rent?

14:03.909 --> 14:05.103
Oh, yeah, I do,
actually.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.804
I carry around a list
with me at all times...

14:06.879 --> 14:08.710
...of abandoned buildings
for fake colleges.

14:08.914 --> 14:10.677
Dude, I started you guys
a bank account already.

14:10.749 --> 14:11.909
What do you want me to be,
your realtor?

14:11.984 --> 14:13.713
Oh, hey, guys.
What's up?

14:13.786 --> 14:14.810
Hey, what's up, Glen?

14:14.887 --> 14:15.876
Hey.
Hey, Glen...

14:15.955 --> 14:17.889
...when did you start working
at the Kwik 'N Stop?

14:17.957 --> 14:22.326
Since I got boned, hard,
by every college I applied to.

14:22.394 --> 14:23.554
Why, what happened?

14:23.662 --> 14:25.289
Some political crap.

14:25.497 --> 14:27.624
I got a zero on my SATs.

14:28.133 --> 14:29.760
You know
you get 600 points...

14:29.835 --> 14:31.359
...just for signing
your name, right?

14:36.275 --> 14:37.765
All right,
let's get serious, man.

14:37.843 --> 14:40.277
Now, where we gonna find a
place to pass off as a college?

14:40.346 --> 14:43.406
Hey, guys! I know a place.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.078
How'd you know
about this place?

14:47.152 --> 14:48.710
I used to do
volunteer work here.

14:48.787 --> 14:49.845
This
place is awesome.

14:49.922 --> 14:51.719
'Cause now I can
finally get hepatitis.

14:51.790 --> 14:54.088
A bird in the hand, dude.
A bird in the hand.

14:54.159 --> 14:55.649
That doesn't
make any sense.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.127
It's a saying.
What?

14:57.196 --> 14:58.823
A diamond in the rough.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.492
Hope you guys
have hobo-stab insurance.

15:03.769 --> 15:05.896
Great.
The birthplace of crack.

15:09.942 --> 15:11.671
Hello, beautiful.

15:14.847 --> 15:16.610
Hey! Hey, guys,
don't go in there.

15:16.682 --> 15:17.706
This is breaking
and entering.

15:17.783 --> 15:19.978
Schrader, come on.
Don't be scared.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.188
Who's scared? I'm not scared. You're scared.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.951
Schrader, you were scared to
try the new flavor of Dr. Pepper.

15:26.025 --> 15:28.391
I told you that
in confidence, Hands.

15:28.727 --> 15:30.354
Schrader, you were afraid
when your tooth fell out...

15:30.429 --> 15:31.953
...because you were terrified
of the tooth fairy.

15:32.031 --> 15:33.396
That's actually
a legitimate fear.

15:33.465 --> 15:35.023
She was rifling
through my shit.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.931
Okay, Fine, whatever, dude, stay here.

15:37.002 --> 15:38.526
Fine. I will.

15:39.705 --> 15:40.967
Okay, guys, seriously...

15:41.040 --> 15:43.406
I don't want to be here alone
when the walls start to bleed.

15:43.475 --> 15:44.999
We don't have
to renovate the whole place.

15:45.077 --> 15:46.408
We just have to focus
on essential areas.

15:46.478 --> 15:48.503
We got the... The main lobby.
Hallway.

15:48.580 --> 15:50.514
Dorm rooms.
Dorm rooms, exactly.

15:50.582 --> 15:52.743
I think this could really work.
Huh? It's awesome!

15:52.818 --> 15:54.251
Can you hold that?
Yeah.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.083
Guys, a little can-do
attitude, some elbow grease...

15:56.155 --> 15:57.452
...maybe a smile from Schrader.

15:57.523 --> 15:59.548
It's like cleaning up
your room, you know?

15:59.625 --> 16:02.492
Welcome to the South Harmon
Institute of Technology.

16:02.561 --> 16:04.324
Atta baby.
The beginning of good things.

16:04.396 --> 16:05.420
Yeah.

16:14.506 --> 16:16.838
Schrader,
what the hell was that?

16:16.909 --> 16:19.469
Um, this is embarrassing.

16:19.545 --> 16:20.534
Are you kidding?

16:20.612 --> 16:21.636
It would be really cool...

16:21.714 --> 16:24.182
...if you guys wouldn't tell
people I scream like that.

16:42.801 --> 16:44.928
Ready, set, go.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.370
Whoo!
All right.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.598
Uh, whoa, Glen.

16:50.042 --> 16:51.134
Oh, hey, B.

16:51.210 --> 16:52.404
What are you doing here,
buddy?

16:52.478 --> 16:54.173
Rory told me about it.

16:54.246 --> 16:56.680
What are you doing? We were gonna
keep this place a big secret.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.307
But he didn't have
any place to go.

16:58.384 --> 16:59.749
He got fired
from the Kwik 'N Stop.

16:59.818 --> 17:02.048
Is that true? Why'd you...
Why'd you get fired?

17:02.121 --> 17:04.146
I got fired
for making a shrimp slushee.

17:05.223 --> 17:06.281
That's disgusting.
See?

17:06.358 --> 17:07.586
Why would you
do that, pal?

17:07.659 --> 17:09.854
'Cause I was hungry
and thirsty.

17:09.928 --> 17:10.916
Oh, God.

17:35.421 --> 17:38.982
This kitchen is bitchin'!

17:39.525 --> 17:41.220
And this'll be the bath...

17:44.096 --> 17:45.495
Close the door.
Shit!

17:45.564 --> 17:46.929
Close it!

18:17.229 --> 18:20.892
It takes 10,000 steps
to get from here to greatness.

18:20.966 --> 18:22.456
And this right here...

18:22.701 --> 18:24.464
...this is step one.

18:24.670 --> 18:25.830
Good luck, Son.

18:29.508 --> 18:32.602
<i>Mister Ambrose, do you know what
makes Harmon a great college?</i>

18:32.678 --> 18:33.702
<i>Rejection.</i>

18:34.880 --> 18:36.848
The exclusivity
of any university...

18:36.915 --> 18:39.008
...is judged primarily
by the amount of students...

18:39.084 --> 18:40.381
...it rejects.

18:41.019 --> 18:42.680
Unfortunately,
for the last few years...

18:42.754 --> 18:44.813
...we have been unable to
match the amount of students...

18:44.890 --> 18:47.688
...that Yale, Princeton,
or even Stanford rejects...

18:47.759 --> 18:49.727
...primarily because
of our physical limitations.

18:49.795 --> 18:52.059
But all that
is about to change.

18:52.498 --> 18:54.557
Yale has one,
Princeton has one.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.100
And now Harmon College
will have...

18:56.168 --> 18:58.329
...the prestigious entranceway
it deserves.

18:58.403 --> 18:59.961
A verdant buffer zone...

19:00.038 --> 19:02.472
...to keep knowledge in,
and ignorance out.

19:02.574 --> 19:05.236
That is a great idea, sir.
Yes, it is.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.971
Now, you, Mr. Ambrose,
are chairman...

19:07.045 --> 19:08.774
...of the Student Community
Outreach Committee.

19:08.847 --> 19:13.580
I need you to secure
all these decrepit properties...

19:13.652 --> 19:15.279
...in the neighboring community.

19:15.354 --> 19:17.754
So that we can demolish them
to make room...

19:17.823 --> 19:19.882
...for the Van Horne Gateway.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.188
You know what?

19:23.262 --> 19:24.786
This actually looks
like the real deal.

19:24.863 --> 19:27.058
Guys, I don't want to be
too overly optimistic...

19:27.132 --> 19:28.622
...but I think
this could work.

19:29.468 --> 19:31.459
It really looks
professional. Hello.

19:31.537 --> 19:33.027
Hey, kid,
where the hell are you?

19:33.105 --> 19:34.231
<i>Oh, I'm, uh...
Listen.</i>

19:34.306 --> 19:35.705
<i>I took another look
at that website.</i>

19:35.774 --> 19:37.537
What's all this "be
what you want to be" crap?

19:37.609 --> 19:39.770
No, no, Dad, they just... They
just have to say stuff like that...

19:39.845 --> 19:40.937
...just to keep
from being sued.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.072
Yeah, well, sounds like
a bunch of crap to me.

19:43.148 --> 19:45.241
Glen, go long.
Set up a meeting with the dean.

19:46.418 --> 19:48.249
The dean? Jesus.
Mother of hell!

19:48.320 --> 19:50.185
Your college does
have a dean, doesn't it?

19:50.255 --> 19:52.587
I'm good! Yes, of course
the college has a dean.

19:52.658 --> 19:53.920
Dad, you know, he's a busy guy,
though, you know...

19:53.992 --> 19:55.721
...he can't just, uh,
set up a meeting with parents.

19:55.794 --> 19:57.887
<i>Listen. If I'm paying for
it, I'm meeting with the dean.</i>

19:58.096 --> 20:01.156
I want to make sure you have the same
education I did. A real education.

20:01.233 --> 20:05.101
<i>Dinner's at 8:00. Wait, Dad, Dad,
Dad, I can't... I can't... Aw, shit.</i>

20:05.170 --> 20:07.229
I gotta trim this corner right
here. I think I got poisoned.

20:07.306 --> 20:09.399
What's up, B?
We got a little problem.

20:09.474 --> 20:11.339
What?
Who was that, Bartleby?

20:12.511 --> 20:14.035
We gotta find a dean.

20:14.646 --> 20:18.446
In life, it's important to
distinguish between need and want.

20:18.617 --> 20:22.383
You think you want something because
you've been conditioned to want it.

20:22.454 --> 20:24.319
I want the Pump!

20:24.389 --> 20:26.186
I don't got the Pump.

20:26.258 --> 20:30.592
Look, oh, I got the
Tim Duncan Adidas Cool-D's.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.198
I want the Pump!

20:33.398 --> 20:35.389
Listen,
you insolent little snot...

20:35.467 --> 20:39.198
...there are kids right now in Asia who
are sewing your stupid shoes together...

20:39.271 --> 20:41.899
...so that their family can have
a bowl of rice to eat tonight!

20:41.974 --> 20:44.067
This is the worst idea
of all time.

20:44.142 --> 20:45.973
Your Uncle Ben
used to be a genius.

20:46.044 --> 20:47.272
He'll be fine.
Mom!

20:47.346 --> 20:48.335
What did you do?

20:48.413 --> 20:49.971
You're the one who
emotionally crippled the kid.

20:50.048 --> 20:52.278
You know what?
Maybe he's retarded.

20:52.651 --> 20:54.278
I'm glad my mother's dead.

20:54.353 --> 20:55.581
He's just having a bad day.

20:55.654 --> 20:57.019
Oh, my gosh.

20:57.456 --> 20:59.321
You want me to be the dean
of your college?

20:59.391 --> 21:01.154
No, I want you
to pretend to be the dean.

21:01.226 --> 21:02.250
It's just for one day.

21:02.327 --> 21:04.921
Uh, perhaps young Sherman
didn't share this with you.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.864
I've retired, I'm no longer
a shaper of young minds.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.025
Oh, really?

21:09.101 --> 21:10.363
Yeah, well, technically,
he was fired.

21:10.435 --> 21:13.598
That's not true. I got fed up
with the education racket.

21:13.672 --> 21:14.764
So I quit.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.432
I did send in my resignation...

21:16.508 --> 21:18.408
...in a rather
unorthodox fashion.

21:18.477 --> 21:21.469
You sent the dean of the
university a bag of dog shit.

21:21.747 --> 21:23.442
It was a metaphor.
For what?

21:23.515 --> 21:25.039
For "You're full of shit!"
Oh.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.846
That's not a metaphor.
That's a metaphor.

21:26.918 --> 21:28.408
Oh, semantics, schmantics.

21:28.487 --> 21:30.421
Three years from now,
I'm finished with this crap.

21:30.489 --> 21:32.514
I'm goin' to Papua New Guinea.
I'm outta here.

21:32.591 --> 21:34.218
Wh-Where...
Where you going?

21:34.293 --> 21:35.692
I'm going off the grid.

21:35.761 --> 21:38.389
No more, uh, franchises,
no more Botox...

21:38.463 --> 21:41.523
...no more "Eh, oh,
let's clone another goat. "

21:41.600 --> 21:43.761
And certainly no more
sexual harassment suits.

21:43.835 --> 21:46.770
What's wrong with saying,
"Hey! Nice tits. "

21:46.838 --> 21:48.237
When did that
go out the window?

21:48.307 --> 21:50.002
Okay, Ben,
all I'm asking you...

21:50.075 --> 21:52.373
...is just shake a couple hands
with some parents...

21:52.444 --> 21:54.571
...say, "Hi, I'm the dean,"
whatever.

21:54.646 --> 21:55.806
What if we pay you?

21:55.881 --> 21:58.543
Don't sully my dignity
with your cash.

21:58.617 --> 22:01.142
There you are!
Did you make another child cry?

22:02.120 --> 22:05.089
It's not my fault the kid's
a crybaby! Little dipshit.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.057
You're an asshole!
You're an asshole.

22:07.125 --> 22:09.218
You are an asshole.
And you're fired.

22:11.229 --> 22:13.720
Perhaps it is time to move on.

22:13.799 --> 22:15.323
But I get to bring my house.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.526
Deal.

22:16.635 --> 22:18.330
Right or left?
Right.

22:18.403 --> 22:20.132
Whose right?
Your call.

22:20.205 --> 22:22.503
You're an idiot!
You're upset.

22:22.574 --> 22:23.836
Go with what you feel.

22:23.909 --> 22:25.467
You got about 12 feet.

22:27.879 --> 22:29.039
Perfect.

22:29.214 --> 22:30.511
Asshole.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.113
Okay, smiles, everyone.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.709
First day at college.

22:34.786 --> 22:36.447
What's up with these colors?
Shit brown? Really?

22:36.521 --> 22:38.352
Glen picked 'em.
Of course he did.

22:38.423 --> 22:39.720
Where'd you find
all these people?

22:39.791 --> 22:42.692
Uh, I volunteer at an
English-as-a-second-language program.

22:42.761 --> 22:45.025
These are my students. I told
them if they wanted to pass...

22:45.097 --> 22:46.155
...they'd have to
successfully assimilate...

22:46.231 --> 22:47.664
...into the American
college environment.

22:47.733 --> 22:49.928
Whoa! The parents are here!

22:50.535 --> 22:52.469
Okay!
We're on, guys!

22:52.537 --> 22:54.471
Okay, people,
it's showtime!

22:55.440 --> 22:56.464
Wow.

22:56.541 --> 22:58.475
No frills around here. Oh, none at all.

22:58.543 --> 23:03.742
None of that, uh, that ivy, or gargoyles,
or mahogany, it's the real deal.

23:04.483 --> 23:05.745
The real deal, huh?

23:05.817 --> 23:06.909
This is it, kid.
This is it.

23:06.985 --> 23:08.816
The big moment. Take this in.
Ah.

23:08.887 --> 23:10.354
It's exciting, it's scary.

23:10.422 --> 23:13.721
It's really scary.
Oh, look! Oh, it looks great.

23:14.126 --> 23:15.115
Okay.

23:15.727 --> 23:16.785
What's going on here?

23:16.862 --> 23:18.352
Okay, we lost
one of the campers.

23:18.430 --> 23:19.658
Curious campers.

23:19.731 --> 23:21.562
What are you doing?
Don't do that. Don't do that.

23:21.633 --> 23:24.363
Honey.

23:24.436 --> 23:26.734
Take it easy.
Okay, here we are. Let's...

23:27.973 --> 23:28.997
What the devil is that?
Oh.

23:29.074 --> 23:31.770
That's just a surge
of collegiate energy.

23:31.843 --> 23:33.105
It's college for you.

23:33.178 --> 23:35.009
Take a left up here
for the dorm room, Dad.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.638
Oh, uh, can you
hang on a second?

23:36.715 --> 23:39.240
I just really gotta go to the
bathroom a minute, you know.

23:39.317 --> 23:40.841
Oh, Jesus Christ.
I just wanna...

23:40.919 --> 23:42.409
No, no, no, no, no!

23:42.754 --> 23:45.120
Uh, it's, that's,
it's the men's room.

23:45.190 --> 23:46.589
You can't go in there.

23:46.658 --> 23:47.989
Well, can't you just
stand outside...

23:48.059 --> 23:49.856
Diane, can't you wait
till we get to the restaurant?

23:49.928 --> 23:52.260
Hey, I'll see you, Rasheed.
I'll see you in math class.

23:52.330 --> 23:53.627
You owe me 30 bucks,
by the way.

23:53.698 --> 23:54.926
You jokester.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.968
Here we are. You remember Hands.
Hey, Mrs. Gaines.

23:57.035 --> 23:58.502
Hey, hi.
The fam.

23:58.570 --> 24:00.060
You look great.
Well, thank you.

24:00.138 --> 24:01.765
When I first saw it, I was
like, I gotta live here?

24:01.840 --> 24:03.102
I can't believe this.
But it's a dorm room.

24:03.208 --> 24:05.108
Mr. Gaines.
Daryl, how are you, partner?

24:05.177 --> 24:06.337
Oh, thunder grip.

24:06.411 --> 24:08.811
Why are there bars
on the window?

24:09.681 --> 24:13.412
Oh, that's so nobody
accidentally gets thrown out.

24:13.485 --> 24:15.248
It's fine. It's a good learning environment.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.311
Not a lot of extras.
You'll study harder.

24:17.389 --> 24:20.290
Yes. We will, because of the
blue and the sparse walls.

24:20.358 --> 24:21.347
I agree with you, sir.

24:21.426 --> 24:22.415
What are these?

24:22.494 --> 24:24.894
That's in case
of an earthquake.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.897
Uh, never mind that.
Hey, let's go meet the dean.

24:26.965 --> 24:28.193
Huh?
The dean.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.196
Come here, honey.
Come on.

24:32.504 --> 24:34.267
Which way?
Take a right there, Mom.

24:34.339 --> 24:36.466
It's gonna be fun.

24:36.541 --> 24:38.133
You know,
a lot of people say...

24:38.210 --> 24:41.236
...that college is the time
when young men and women...

24:41.446 --> 24:44.438
...expand the way
that they look at their world...

24:44.516 --> 24:48.043
...when they open their minds
to new ideas and experiences...

24:48.119 --> 24:50.610
...and when they begin
that long journey...

24:50.689 --> 24:52.714
...from the innocence of youth...

24:52.824 --> 24:55.019
...to the responsibilities
of adulthood.

24:56.294 --> 24:58.785
Now isn't that
a load of horseshit?

25:05.971 --> 25:07.029
W- What?

25:07.105 --> 25:09.232
Could you explain that
to us a little more?

25:09.307 --> 25:11.468
Uh, Dean Lewis,
why don't you tell them...

25:11.543 --> 25:13.841
...a little bit about the
philosophy here at South Harmon?

25:13.912 --> 25:17.643
Look, we throw a lot of fancy
words in front of these kids...

25:17.716 --> 25:19.980
...in order to attract them
to going to school...

25:20.051 --> 25:22.212
...in the belief that they're
gonna have a better life.

25:22.287 --> 25:24.517
And we all know
that all we're doing...

25:24.589 --> 25:26.489
...is breeding
a whole new generation...

25:26.558 --> 25:27.923
...of buyers and sellers.

25:27.993 --> 25:29.392
Buyers and sellers!

25:29.461 --> 25:31.793
Pimps and whores.
Pimps and whores!

25:32.097 --> 25:36.932
And indoctrinating them into a
life-long hell of debt and indecision.

25:38.637 --> 25:40.502
I...
Um...

25:41.106 --> 25:42.573
I... I just don't understand.

25:42.641 --> 25:45.075
Do I have
to spoon-feed it to you?

25:45.210 --> 25:47.804
Look, there's only one reason...

25:47.879 --> 25:50.370
...that kids
want to go to school.

25:50.448 --> 25:51.540
Holy shit.

25:59.925 --> 26:00.914
Which is?

26:04.763 --> 26:06.162
To get a good job.

26:09.467 --> 26:13.369
To get a good job,
with a great starting salary.

26:21.313 --> 26:22.712
I couldn't agree more.

26:25.383 --> 26:28.352
It is so refreshing
to have somebody...

26:28.420 --> 26:30.684
...approach education
so rationally.

26:31.189 --> 26:32.213
Fuckin' A!

26:33.692 --> 26:35.683
Well, Dad. Ow.

26:39.931 --> 26:40.920
Oh, Mom.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.167
You make us proud, kiddo.

26:43.234 --> 26:44.496
I'll try, Dad.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.098
Don't worry about
anything, okay?

26:47.172 --> 26:48.935
Bye, honey.
Seat belts.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.371
Spread your wings.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.706
I'm gonna fly.
You gotta let me fly.

26:52.777 --> 26:54.301
Bye, Lizzie.
Bye!

26:56.247 --> 26:57.236
Bye!

27:01.987 --> 27:03.579
So what do we do now?

27:03.888 --> 27:05.856
Well, my friend,
we're in college now.

27:05.924 --> 27:07.152
We can do whatever we want.

27:07.826 --> 27:09.623
Gotta hand it to you, B.

27:09.694 --> 27:11.855
Kids everywhere are busting
their ass in the classroom...

27:11.930 --> 27:13.227
...and we're killing
aliens, dude.

27:13.298 --> 27:15.528
This is way better than learning.
We are learning here, pal.

27:15.600 --> 27:19.036
We're learning the dire cost to
civilization when diplomacy fails.

27:19.104 --> 27:20.799
We're learning political science right now.

27:22.240 --> 27:24.504
What the...
What the hell is that?

27:28.480 --> 27:29.572
Who is it?

27:29.814 --> 27:31.782
Abernathy
Darwin Dunlap, sir.

27:33.752 --> 27:34.912
Hi, there!

27:34.986 --> 27:35.975
What's your name?

27:36.054 --> 27:37.783
My name's
Abernathy Darwin Dunlap.

27:37.856 --> 27:39.289
But you could call me A.D.D...

27:39.357 --> 27:41.621
...on account of the fact
that I have A.D.D...

27:41.693 --> 27:43.285
...which is Attention Deficit Disorder
and you know...

27:43.361 --> 27:46.159
...everyone used to think it was just
an addiction to sugar when I was six...

27:46.231 --> 27:48.825
...and my mom used to cry because
she thought I would never be...

27:48.900 --> 27:50.424
...like, a fully functioning
member of society...

27:50.502 --> 27:52.902
...like my neighbor
who has Legionnaire's Disease.

27:53.905 --> 27:54.894
Oh...

27:55.907 --> 27:58.102
This is no longer
a mental health facility.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.734
I'm so sorry
we can't help you.

27:59.811 --> 28:02.371
Good luck to you, pal.
I don't need a hospital!

28:02.447 --> 28:04.813
Okay, okay, wh-wh-what
are you doing here, then?

28:04.883 --> 28:06.316
Well, unless
I misread the website...

28:06.384 --> 28:08.318
I'm here for orientation!

28:09.320 --> 28:13.381
Oh, you scared me for a
second. In more ways than one.

28:13.458 --> 28:15.323
Uh, you're looking
for Harmon College...

28:15.393 --> 28:16.451
...it's just right on
up the hill.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.086
But good luck, have fun.
Go, Harmon.

28:18.163 --> 28:21.326
No! I'm looking for South
Harmon Institute of Technology...

28:21.399 --> 28:23.629
...because, well,
it's the only place I got accepted...

28:23.702 --> 28:25.966
...and I'm looking
to pursue my degree in English...

28:26.037 --> 28:29.564
...or law or animal husbandry
or anything really!

28:29.808 --> 28:31.969
Did you just say
you got accepted here?

28:32.043 --> 28:34.011
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah,
we all did.

28:34.079 --> 28:35.068
What?

28:52.330 --> 28:53.820
Thank you so much!

28:59.104 --> 29:01.834
Oh, God.
Holy balls.

29:03.007 --> 29:04.099
I'm sorry.

29:04.342 --> 29:05.604
Move, fool.

29:06.945 --> 29:09.812
Oh, look, there's
my old girlfriend, Sara Pelfan.

29:11.416 --> 29:13.145
You broke my heart!

29:16.387 --> 29:17.547
Please.

29:19.958 --> 29:22.688
Oh, uh, sorry, sorry. No
parents allowed past this point.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.695
It's part of our philosophy
here at South Harmon.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.094
We need to mold
your kids into individuals...

29:26.164 --> 29:27.256
...and the first step is to...

29:27.332 --> 29:29.425
...sever the ties of
the parent-child relationship.

29:29.501 --> 29:30.798
Take him.

29:30.869 --> 29:32.427
We're just glad
Larry got in someplace.

29:32.504 --> 29:33.835
He's your problem now.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.271
Bye, hon. No biting!

29:37.342 --> 29:38.468
Hey, Larry.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.540
Okay, good talk.
Go on in there.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.239
You're gonna fit right in,
Larry. Unfortunately.

29:42.313 --> 29:43.405
What are we gonna do?

29:43.481 --> 29:44.812
This is supposed
to be a secret.

29:44.883 --> 29:46.043
Yeah, well, I guess
the secret's out.

29:46.117 --> 29:48.551
You go check the P.O. Box, I'm
gonna go find Schrader, okay?

29:56.861 --> 29:59.853
Hey, pledge guy,
welcome to B.K.E. House.

29:59.931 --> 30:01.660
Can I take
your blazer for you?

30:01.733 --> 30:03.360
Get in there, your future
is right in there.

30:03.434 --> 30:05.197
Thank you.
All right.

30:11.843 --> 30:12.867
Oh, shit.

30:12.944 --> 30:15.276
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry. Sorry.

30:15.780 --> 30:18.374
Bartleby. Hey, how are you?
Hey, how you doing?

30:18.449 --> 30:19.677
Good. I'm so sorry
about your jacket.

30:19.751 --> 30:22.219
Dude, don't worry about it.
It's... It's not even my jacket.

30:22.287 --> 30:24.482
Perfect. So, what are you doing here?

30:24.556 --> 30:26.786
I'm, I'm looking for Schrader,
actually. Have you seen him?

30:26.891 --> 30:28.791
Uh, no, I haven't.

30:28.860 --> 30:30.691
Hey, I'm Sherman Schrader.

30:32.597 --> 30:34.224
I'll catch up with you.

30:36.501 --> 30:37.490
Hey.

30:38.570 --> 30:41.539
I'm Sherman Schrader. Okay.

30:43.942 --> 30:45.807
This is fun.
I'm just gonna hang back...

30:45.877 --> 30:48.175
...while you guys shoot around
and stuff, you know.

30:48.246 --> 30:49.713
Oh, shit.

30:49.781 --> 30:50.770
I got it.

30:57.288 --> 31:00.086
Oh.
That's a... It's a G chord.

31:00.625 --> 31:03.287
I used to play
in a Cranberries tribute band.

31:03.494 --> 31:05.325
Uh, we disbanded.

31:05.396 --> 31:07.956
Hey, you're Sherman Schrader.
Yeah.

31:08.032 --> 31:09.966
Hoyt Ambrose.
Yes, right. I know.

31:10.034 --> 31:12.969
Yes. You are the president
of this whole fraternity.

31:13.037 --> 31:15.005
That's right. Right.
You date Monica Moreland.

31:15.073 --> 31:16.335
That I do.
Right.

31:16.407 --> 31:18.136
I think about her
when I masturbate.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.307
What?
What?

31:27.752 --> 31:30.118
I didn't mean to say that.

31:30.355 --> 31:34.257
Yeah. So, uh, Sherman's father pledged
alongside my father back in the day.

31:34.325 --> 31:35.553
Oh, so you're the legacy.

31:35.627 --> 31:37.595
That's right. Legacy!

31:40.465 --> 31:42.524
You need... You probably
need this to play, actually.

31:42.600 --> 31:44.067
Was it here?

31:44.135 --> 31:45.864
Uh, was it there? Was it...

31:45.937 --> 31:48.371
So... So do you go
to school here now, or...

31:48.439 --> 31:50.839
I don't. Uh,
I go to South Harmon.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.103
Did you say South Harmon?

31:52.176 --> 31:53.438
Yes, I did.

31:53.511 --> 31:54.671
Oh, what's that?
Hmm?

31:54.746 --> 31:56.441
Wha-What's South Harmon?

31:56.514 --> 31:58.539
South Harmon is...
It's a college...

31:58.616 --> 32:01.016
...just a very small college.
Teeny, tiny college.

32:01.085 --> 32:02.814
That's great. Well,
congratulations to you. Thank you.

32:02.887 --> 32:04.684
Hey, sweetie.
Hey!

32:04.756 --> 32:06.189
Oh, my gosh,
I was so excited for you...

32:06.257 --> 32:08.384
Actually, can you just give me
just one sec, okay? Thanks.

32:08.459 --> 32:11.121
Hey, winner, Hoyt Ambrose.

32:11.462 --> 32:13.191
Floyd Pambrose.

32:13.264 --> 32:15.664
That's weird.
Our names rhyme.

32:15.733 --> 32:17.200
Yeah, that is
pretty weird.

32:17.268 --> 32:18.895
That's kind of crazy.
Welcome to B.K.E.

32:18.970 --> 32:20.995
Thanks. It's great.
I love it here.

32:21.072 --> 32:22.903
All the sexually repressed energy. Oh.

32:22.974 --> 32:25.340
I love it. A lot of anti-Semitism,
but under the rug, you know.

32:25.410 --> 32:27.401
I like it, I like the way
you handle your business.

32:27.478 --> 32:28.638
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

32:28.713 --> 32:30.874
Well, hey, why don't you just
hang around and meet some guys?

32:30.949 --> 32:32.541
Oh, no, thanks, man,
I'm not into guys.

32:32.617 --> 32:35.711
I totally respect your lifestyle
choice, though. And good luck with it.

32:35.887 --> 32:37.752
Your parents probably
don't get it, but I do.

32:37.822 --> 32:40.791
I'll see you later, Monica.
Bye. It was good to see you.

32:40.858 --> 32:42.917
I'll see you later, Thor.
I mean Dirk.

32:42.994 --> 32:45.121
Uh, I mean Trent.
Sorry, Troy.

32:45.863 --> 32:47.626
Whoop, sorry, Goldie.

32:50.168 --> 32:52.193
Schrader, where you been? I've
been calling you for half an hour.

32:52.270 --> 32:54.135
What the hell, man?
I'm in the middle of rush.

32:54.205 --> 32:56.435
I don't care, man.
I got a situation goin' on.

32:56.507 --> 32:57.997
This is huge for me,
all right?

32:58.076 --> 32:59.976
You can't be here right now.
Okay, okay, okay.

33:00.044 --> 33:02.205
Remember that time we had to
steal my mom's birth control pills?

33:02.280 --> 33:04.771
Yeah, and then Lizzie was
born. It's worse than that.

33:05.316 --> 33:06.248
Where did these people
come from?

33:06.317 --> 33:09.047
Oh, from the chaos catalog.
They were going out of business.

33:09.120 --> 33:10.747
What is happening?
I'll tell you what's happening.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.689
I told you to make the website
look legitimate, not functional.

33:13.758 --> 33:16.090
Hey, you wanted to fool your
dad. And the guy's not an idiot.

33:16.160 --> 33:19.391
And, also, it was your idea to put
"Acceptance is just one click away. "

33:19.464 --> 33:22.831
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Put it as one click
away, you don't make it clickable.

33:23.768 --> 33:25.895
Oh, my...
Holy shit.

33:26.004 --> 33:26.993
Yeah.

33:27.071 --> 33:29.164
They all paid
first semester's tuition?

33:29.240 --> 33:31.071
Oh, yeah.
10,000 bucks apiece.

33:31.142 --> 33:33.372
I stopped counting
after the first 100 checks.

33:33.444 --> 33:35.469
That's $74,000,000.

33:36.647 --> 33:38.274
It's $1,000,000, Glen.

33:38.349 --> 33:40.214
Yeah. In human dollars.

33:40.284 --> 33:42.752
Okay, okay, okay.
We gotta do something.

33:42.820 --> 33:45.482
Hey, don't look at me. Ask
one of the founding fathers.

33:45.556 --> 33:46.545
B?

33:47.091 --> 33:48.786
This isn't my deal, man.

33:48.860 --> 33:52.057
I told you this was a bad idea
from the get-go.

33:52.130 --> 33:53.119
True.

33:54.098 --> 33:56.259
We could have
a Battle Royale.

33:57.769 --> 33:59.498
Wow.
What is that?

34:00.505 --> 34:04.305
B, you gotta
tell these people to go home.

34:04.542 --> 34:06.032
You are absolutely right,
my friend.

34:06.110 --> 34:07.543
I started this,
I'm gonna finish it.

34:07.612 --> 34:08.704
Thank you.

34:15.686 --> 34:16.675
Go.

34:23.661 --> 34:25.492
Hey. Hey, Glen!

34:27.565 --> 34:28.759
All right.

34:33.938 --> 34:35.735
Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

34:35.973 --> 34:37.940
Excuse me. I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, everybody.

34:38.009 --> 34:39.909
Can I... Can I just get your
attention for one minute?

34:39.976 --> 34:42.377
Um, yeah, I'll be taking
questions in a minute.

34:42.447 --> 34:44.277
Just give me one second,
please. Hold on. All right.

34:44.348 --> 34:45.871
Who the hell are you?

34:47.418 --> 34:49.351
Ah-ah. Okay.

34:49.420 --> 34:50.784
That's a good question.
Thank you.

34:50.855 --> 34:52.755
My name's Bartleby. Hello.

34:52.824 --> 34:55.088
Um, Gaines,
for what it's worth.

34:55.159 --> 34:57.127
And, um, you know
on the website how it said...

34:57.195 --> 34:59.254
"Acceptance is just
one click away"?

34:59.330 --> 35:00.422
Do you remember that?

35:00.498 --> 35:01.795
We had intended...
Hold on.

35:01.866 --> 35:04.596
We added that because we were... Aw, shit.

35:05.136 --> 35:08.003
Yeah, okay, what... I'm sorry.
What... What... What do you want?

35:08.072 --> 35:09.903
When I got accepted here...

35:09.974 --> 35:13.102
...it was the first time my parents
ever said they were proud of me!

35:26.357 --> 35:29.190
That's cool.
Um, that's cool, man.

35:34.132 --> 35:37.932
Hey, uh, just show of hands, how
many people applied to other colleges?

35:39.270 --> 35:41.170
Everybody. Uh, okay.

35:41.372 --> 35:44.466
And how many of you got in to
the other places you applied to?

35:52.183 --> 35:53.241
Nobody.

35:53.317 --> 35:55.046
Nobody got in anywhere else?

35:57.388 --> 36:00.050
And you know what?
I didn't, either.

36:00.124 --> 36:01.682
I didn't get into
a real college.

36:01.759 --> 36:03.624
A really, really good college.

36:04.829 --> 36:07.161
I know what it's like
to be rejected. It sucks.

36:07.231 --> 36:09.028
Rejection blows.
Being said no to.

36:09.100 --> 36:10.829
You know what, I'm sorry, you're
just not quite good enough.

36:10.902 --> 36:12.130
You didn't have
enough extracurriculars.

36:12.203 --> 36:13.295
You didn't play enough tennis.

36:13.371 --> 36:15.896
You didn't study hard enough for your
scores. So you're not gonna make it.

36:15.973 --> 36:17.770
You know what? Screw that!

36:17.842 --> 36:18.934
What's he doing?

36:19.010 --> 36:20.136
I think
he's winging it.

36:20.211 --> 36:22.771
Shouldn't we all have
the chance to be said yes to?

36:22.847 --> 36:26.112
At South Harmon,
we say yes to you!

36:26.184 --> 36:28.277
We say yes to your hopes.

36:28.352 --> 36:30.252
We say yes to your dreams.

36:30.321 --> 36:32.983
We say yes to your flaws!
So welcome!

36:33.057 --> 36:34.490
Grab a room, grab a friend...

36:34.559 --> 36:36.083
...grab yourself,
we don't give a shit.

36:36.160 --> 36:38.890
Welcome to South Harmon
Institute of Technology!

36:42.333 --> 36:43.493
Oh, man.

36:43.568 --> 36:45.297
And welcome to S.H.I.T.!

36:45.469 --> 36:47.300
You! I love you!

37:03.921 --> 37:04.945
What are you doing?

37:05.423 --> 37:07.118
Do you realize
how stupid this is?

37:07.191 --> 37:09.250
You invited everyone to a
college that doesn't exist.

37:09.327 --> 37:11.887
I... I just couldn't do it,
okay? You saw their faces.

37:11.963 --> 37:13.191
They got rejected
from everywhere.

37:13.264 --> 37:16.062
What... What kind of message does that
send if I reject them from my college?

37:16.133 --> 37:17.760
You don't have a college!

37:17.835 --> 37:19.097
Hey, hey, hey,
where's the bookstore?

37:19.170 --> 37:20.159
Oh, we have a deal
with Amazon.

37:20.238 --> 37:21.535
You just buy 'em
with a credit card.

37:21.606 --> 37:22.698
When do we sign up
for classes?

37:22.773 --> 37:24.240
Uh, we extended orientation.
You're fine.

37:24.308 --> 37:26.208
Hey, man, where the heck
do we eat around here?

37:26.277 --> 37:28.006
Uh, Glen, uh, 300 pizzas.
Order them.

37:28.079 --> 37:30.070
18 pizza pockets.
What? No, no, no. 3...

37:30.147 --> 37:32.707
Hey, who do I give
my intuition money to?

37:33.084 --> 37:36.576
Who? What?
Me, I guess.

37:37.188 --> 37:39.884
I'm done fishing singles
out of my G-string.

37:39.957 --> 37:42.391
I'm a college girl now!
Aw, yeah.

37:42.460 --> 37:43.620
Wow.

37:43.794 --> 37:47.230
Uh, B, hey, uh, you just
started a fictional college.

37:47.298 --> 37:48.663
Oh, God. Yeah, yeah, okay.

37:48.733 --> 37:49.961
Hey, do you guys have
a swim team here?

37:50.034 --> 37:52.332
Yes, you know what? This is Hands
Holloway. He's the Athletic Director.

37:52.403 --> 37:54.928
He can help you with anything you
need to know. I can't do it right now.

37:55.006 --> 37:56.303
Thank you, though, thank you,
I'm sorry.

37:56.374 --> 37:59.366
Uh, you guys, what are we gonna do
now? I just need a minute to think.

38:00.211 --> 38:02.270
What? What the...
Holy shit!

38:07.184 --> 38:09.982
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Tex!

38:10.054 --> 38:11.783
What the hell
are you guys doing?

38:11.856 --> 38:13.721
What do you mean?
We're makin' the room bigger!

38:13.791 --> 38:16.521
Yeah, Thorgeous,
but this is my room.

38:16.594 --> 38:19.563
Who's in charge of room
assignments around here, anyway?

38:19.630 --> 38:21.222
Guys, I'd like you
to meet Rory.

38:21.299 --> 38:24.234
She is the resident S.H.I.T.
room assignmenter.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.202
And she'll be more than happy
to help you out with that. Okay?

38:26.270 --> 38:29.398
Okay, uh, I... I guess
I'll show you your rooms.

38:29.473 --> 38:30.770
Follow me.
Thanks.

38:30.841 --> 38:32.138
Sorry about the wall.

38:32.209 --> 38:33.301
Oh, it's fine.
Don't worry about it, man.

38:33.377 --> 38:34.901
It happens all the time.
No problem.

38:34.979 --> 38:36.571
Yeah, well, we actually
do have a problem...

38:36.647 --> 38:38.114
...because you don't know
how to run a college.

38:38.182 --> 38:39.410
It's fine. It's okay.
It's fine.

38:39.483 --> 38:41.974
We'll just relax, get some sleep,
we'll regroup tomorrow morning.

38:42.053 --> 38:43.350
It will be totally calm.

38:53.064 --> 38:56.465
Ahoy! Scallywags
and scally-ladies.

39:02.073 --> 39:04.371
Okay, dude, B, I'm with you
on this, I am.

39:04.442 --> 39:07.206
But we need a plan, dude.
We need a plan now.

39:07.278 --> 39:09.337
I know. I know.
I... I... I... I'm processing.

39:12.850 --> 39:14.147
You're gonna need
to process faster.

39:15.753 --> 39:18.688
What is... Why are the...
Find out what's going on.

39:18.856 --> 39:20.983
<i>- Yo!
- Ah, there's my college man.</i>

39:21.058 --> 39:22.355
<i>How you doin', kid?</i>

39:22.426 --> 39:24.587
Dad, now is not the... The...
the best time to talk.

39:24.662 --> 39:25.686
<i>Hang on,
let me get your mother.</i>

39:25.763 --> 39:27.196
Can I have this?
Come here, let me talk to you.

39:27.264 --> 39:30.461
Diane, pick up!
Honey! Is it you?

39:30.534 --> 39:31.796
Stop yellin'
in the damn phone.

39:31.869 --> 39:34.633
Oh, it feels like ages
since we've spoken to you.

39:34.739 --> 39:36.172
How's school so far?

39:36.240 --> 39:38.265
Oh, it's going great.
It's going really...

39:38.342 --> 39:40.435
Hey, someone here
order two dozen kegs?

39:40.511 --> 39:43.207
The... The... The old guy
with the hat, playing craps.

39:43.280 --> 39:44.508
<i>What the hell
was that?</i>

39:44.582 --> 39:46.379
Sounded like he said
something about two dozen kegs.

39:46.450 --> 39:48.281
Bartleby, are you
experimenting with alcohol?

39:48.352 --> 39:49.944
<i>Aw, no, no, no.
He said two dozen eggs, Mom.</i>

39:50.020 --> 39:51.851
You misunderstood.
Two dozen eggs.

39:51.922 --> 39:53.150
What took you so long?

39:53.224 --> 39:55.089
I've been building
a thirst over there!

39:55.159 --> 39:57.753
Hey, listen, I'm not paying for
you to be making omelets up there.

39:57.828 --> 39:59.420
<i>Tell me what classes
you're taking.</i>

39:59.497 --> 40:00.486
Classes?

40:00.798 --> 40:02.595
Uh, right. I'm taking...

40:04.034 --> 40:05.160
Statistics.

40:05.369 --> 40:07.530
And, uh, business...

40:08.606 --> 40:10.267
...and anatomy.

40:10.341 --> 40:12.138
<i>- Anatomy?
- Anatomy?</i>

40:12.243 --> 40:13.471
Thanks, dude.

40:13.644 --> 40:14.770
<i>Bartleby, Bartleby!</i>

40:14.845 --> 40:15.834
Yeah!

40:19.350 --> 40:21.944
Hey. I always wanted
to go to college.

40:22.019 --> 40:23.680
Couldn't get in
anywhere, though...

40:23.754 --> 40:24.982
'cause I was in the military.

40:25.055 --> 40:26.079
Oh.
Beverage ops.

40:26.157 --> 40:28.318
I was snooping around,
saw something secretive.

40:28.392 --> 40:30.053
Next thing I know
CIA swoops in...

40:30.127 --> 40:31.958
...does this whole
brain-scramble thing.

40:32.029 --> 40:33.018
Now I can't remember anything.

40:33.097 --> 40:34.689
So do you have room
at the college for me?

40:34.765 --> 40:37.791
You know what, we already
started the semester, I'm sorry.

40:37.868 --> 40:39.529
That's cool, man.
Yeah.

40:39.603 --> 40:41.503
It's just I... I got
my GI Bill...

40:41.572 --> 40:43.836
...and I can pay you
all four years in advance.

40:43.908 --> 40:46.536
Okay, you're in.
Yeah!

40:46.610 --> 40:48.601
Yeah, welcome
to South Harmon. Whoo-hoo!

40:50.114 --> 40:51.342
How's the processing?

40:52.716 --> 40:55.184
I just have to figure
this whole college thing out.

41:00.658 --> 41:03.786
Here at Harmon College,
we offer a highly structured...

41:03.861 --> 41:07.854
...time-tested curriculum carefully
designed to stimulate the young mind.

41:07.965 --> 41:11.128
So, Mr. Gaines, you're
thinking about transferring?

41:11.202 --> 41:12.362
I don't know
about transferring.

41:12.436 --> 41:14.028
My life is kind of, like,
a little weird right now.

41:14.104 --> 41:15.628
But I just kind of
want to figure out...

41:15.706 --> 41:17.264
...what all this
is all about.

41:17.341 --> 41:18.433
Sorry.

41:18.509 --> 41:21.774
A- And what college are you
attending right now? Sorry?

41:21.846 --> 41:24.440
The college that you're... Oh,
it's down there. By the thing.

41:24.515 --> 41:25.573
Pardon me?

41:25.649 --> 41:28.482
I'd like to look around, if
that's okay. Uh, that's fine.

41:28.552 --> 41:29.678
If that's what
you'd like to do.

41:29.753 --> 41:32.244
Thank you. It was... It was,
uh, it was great to meet you.

41:32.323 --> 41:33.312
Oh, shit. Sorry.

41:33.390 --> 41:36.120
That's all right. No. You know
what? Leave them, leave them alone.

41:36.193 --> 41:38.058
Leave it,
leave them alone.

41:38.128 --> 41:39.527
And go on and take
your tour, okay?

41:41.098 --> 41:44.431
A single rate of income tax
eliminates loopholes...

41:44.502 --> 41:46.493
...allowances and exemptions...

41:46.570 --> 41:48.731
...as well as
encourages payments...

41:48.806 --> 41:50.865
...through use of
low interest rates...

41:50.941 --> 41:52.499
...which theoretically
would cause...

41:52.576 --> 41:53.668
...an economic boom.

41:53.744 --> 41:57.043
Now if you would refer
back... Aw, shit. I'm sorry.

42:00.718 --> 42:02.447
So theoretically
what I was saying was...

42:02.520 --> 42:03.578
This guy's pretty boring.

42:03.654 --> 42:05.485
Don't talk to me, man! Right,
this is gonna be on the midterm.

42:05.556 --> 42:07.114
And my whole life is riding
on an A in this class.

42:12.429 --> 42:13.794
This guy's...
EBITA!

42:13.864 --> 42:14.922
What?

42:14.999 --> 42:17.797
Earnings Before Interest,
Taxes and Amortization.

42:20.838 --> 42:22.169
<i>Good afternoon, students...</i>

42:22.239 --> 42:24.173
<i>...and welcome, everyone
in the spillover class.</i>

42:24.241 --> 42:25.401
What the... What is this?

42:25.476 --> 42:28.240
<i>We'll begin today's lecture...</i>

42:34.218 --> 42:36.686
Okay, great, yeah. I'll see
you in the library at 8:00.

42:36.754 --> 42:38.779
And I'll bring my notes.
Okay, see you then.

42:38.856 --> 42:40.323
Bye, Monica.

42:45.896 --> 42:48.262
Monica. Hey.

42:48.332 --> 42:51.096
Bartleby. Hey, what, are you
stalking me or something?

42:51.168 --> 42:52.157
Stalking's an ugly word.

42:52.236 --> 42:54.932
I like to think of it more
like obsessively shadowing. Oh.

42:55.005 --> 42:57.303
I'm thinking about going here,
so I'm checking out the classes.

42:57.374 --> 42:59.706
Really? Yeah. Do you like all your classes?

42:59.777 --> 43:01.802
Yeah. I mean, well,
I'm taking a bunch of classes...

43:01.879 --> 43:03.278
...that I don't
really care about.

43:03.347 --> 43:05.338
There was this one, though,
that I was dying to take.

43:05.416 --> 43:07.714
But, um, I ended up not being
able to. But, you know, it's okay.

43:07.785 --> 43:09.218
What was that one
that you wanted to take?

43:09.286 --> 43:12.744
Uh, ph-photography. It's...
Really? That's cool.

43:13.090 --> 43:14.682
Yeah.
What was the problem?

43:14.758 --> 43:17.386
Well, see, there's this,
um, photojournalism class...

43:17.461 --> 43:19.258
...but they said it's only
for journalism majors.

43:19.330 --> 43:20.991
And then there's this
art photography class...

43:21.065 --> 43:22.657
...but they said
it's for fine arts majors.

43:22.733 --> 43:26.066
So my advisor said it would be best
not to take either one, or something...

43:26.136 --> 43:28.036
...because certain
photography classes...

43:28.105 --> 43:30.437
...don't apply
to a degree in photography.

43:30.808 --> 43:32.776
Wow, that makes,
that makes no sense at all.

43:32.843 --> 43:35.243
I know.
Um, but I'm really sorry.

43:35.312 --> 43:37.803
I gotta go, I'm gonna be late for
my Ancient Roman History class.

43:37.881 --> 43:40.679
It was good seeing you. Bye.
Okay. Bye.

43:41.819 --> 43:43.218
Hey, uh...

43:48.125 --> 43:50.616
I'm... I'm just saying, I
mean, is that what college is?

43:50.694 --> 43:53.322
What were you expecting? A
renaissance of the human spirit?

43:53.397 --> 43:55.695
American education
is in the shitter.

43:55.766 --> 43:56.926
You know why?

43:57.001 --> 44:00.095
Because people forget
the most important rule.

44:00.337 --> 44:02.999
College is
a service industry.

44:03.340 --> 44:04.398
A service industry?

44:04.475 --> 44:08.206
As in "serve us," as opposed
to the other way around.

44:08.278 --> 44:10.337
Look, you see
all these kids out here?

44:10.414 --> 44:11.938
They all paid
to come here.

44:12.016 --> 44:13.779
Right. They all paid for an experience.

44:13.851 --> 44:15.318
What kind of experience?

44:15.386 --> 44:17.877
The hell if I know.
I'm not a goddamn mind reader.

44:18.555 --> 44:20.250
Well, maybe
I should just ask them.

44:20.391 --> 44:22.256
Welcome to the conversation.

44:22.326 --> 44:24.055
What do I want to learn?

44:25.229 --> 44:26.628
Why are you asking me?

44:26.697 --> 44:28.756
Well, I'm asking you, Glen,
because I have a hunch...

44:28.832 --> 44:30.663
...that no one's ever really
asked you that before. Yeah?

44:30.734 --> 44:33.931
Well, I like pancakes and
alfalfa sprouts and lemonade.

44:34.038 --> 44:36.529
Okay, you know what, let's appropriate
the bulk of this man's tuition...

44:36.607 --> 44:38.074
...to learning more
about the culinary arts.

44:38.142 --> 44:39.302
Huh?
Food.

44:39.376 --> 44:40.638
All right.
All right.

44:40.711 --> 44:41.939
Rory. What about you?

44:42.012 --> 44:44.640
Ever since nursery school,
every single waking moment...

44:44.715 --> 44:46.706
...of every single day
has been scheduled.

44:46.784 --> 44:48.479
So what do I want to do?

44:49.353 --> 44:50.342
Nothing.

44:50.688 --> 44:53.486
Cheap, zen, beautiful. I like
it. Hands, what about you?

44:53.557 --> 44:56.082
Summer camp I made a paperweight
and won Camp Nagachewy's...

44:56.160 --> 44:59.152
...coveted woodcarving award
and next day...

44:59.229 --> 45:01.322
...ran a 4.6 forty and it's
been football ever since.

45:01.398 --> 45:04.162
Mmm. Woodcarving, sculpting.
Good, something with your hands.

45:04.234 --> 45:05.292
Well, there may be
something in there.

45:05.369 --> 45:08.429
You can think about that, and
then get back to me. All right?

45:08.505 --> 45:11.235
Schrader, what about you? Well,
B, I'm glad you asked, actually.

45:11.308 --> 45:12.673
'Cause since
we're going to prison...

45:12.743 --> 45:15.109
I'm gonna learn how to carve
a shank out of my toothbrush.

45:15.179 --> 45:17.113
Okay, ha-ha. I'll tell you
something, though.

45:17.181 --> 45:19.046
All our lives we've been told what to learn.

45:19.116 --> 45:21.311
Well, today the tide
is gonna turn, my friend.

45:21.385 --> 45:23.114
Because today
we're gonna ask the customer.

45:23.187 --> 45:25.246
What do I want to learn?
What do I want to learn?

45:25.322 --> 45:26.653
What am I interested
in studying?

45:26.724 --> 45:27.713
Huh?
What?

45:27.791 --> 45:29.349
W- What?
Come again.

45:29.426 --> 45:31.189
That's a good question.
No, really, come again.

45:31.261 --> 45:33.092
I thought you were
supposed to tell us.

45:33.163 --> 45:34.721
Please come again!

45:34.965 --> 45:36.023
I want to meet girls.

45:36.100 --> 45:37.124
Girls.
Girls.

45:37.201 --> 45:40.261
Some girls!
Uh, girls.

45:40.337 --> 45:41.497
I wanna rock!

45:42.639 --> 45:43.731
You know, and roll.

45:43.807 --> 45:45.638
Well, as you can probably
tell at this point...

45:45.709 --> 45:47.506
...is that I really want to learn
how to slow things down.

45:47.578 --> 45:49.273
More speed.
More vert.

45:49.346 --> 45:51.246
Maybe something
with clothes, you know?

45:51.315 --> 45:52.748
Putting them on,
taking them off.

45:52.816 --> 45:55.182
I'm really good at that part.
You wanna see?

45:55.252 --> 45:58.244
I want to learn
how to blow shit up with my mind.

45:59.623 --> 46:02.558
Okay. Well, write it on the board.

46:04.128 --> 46:05.117
Go ahead.

46:08.699 --> 46:11.691
Okay, thanks. Okay.

46:13.403 --> 46:15.098
All right.
Thank you, smiley.

46:15.172 --> 46:17.106
Pleasure doing business
with you.

46:17.174 --> 46:18.334
Yeah, buddy.

46:25.282 --> 46:27.750
Taxes? I'll tell you
about that nonsense.

46:27.818 --> 46:29.752
If you're rich,
the government'll protect...

46:29.820 --> 46:31.651
...every buck you make
and every shit you take.

46:34.558 --> 46:36.958
Kiki Dee.
Got a job for you, kid.

46:37.027 --> 46:39.052
New school colors and logo.
You're in charge.

46:39.129 --> 46:40.824
Really?
Don't screw it up.

46:40.898 --> 46:44.265
I won't screw it up,
I... I won't screw anything...

47:09.326 --> 47:10.486
What are you?

47:41.592 --> 47:44.652
Health insurance, my ass.
They don't pay for shit!

47:44.728 --> 47:48.255
You get sick on a Friday, they only
pay for Monday through Thursday.

47:48.332 --> 47:51.495
You go to Dr. A,
they only pay for Dr. B.

47:51.568 --> 47:54.503
You break your penis,
they only fix vaginas.

47:54.738 --> 47:56.638
You mind if I join you?

48:00.043 --> 48:03.137
Ah, cool. Awesome.
Thank you, that was great!

48:03.213 --> 48:04.771
I'll see you guys later.
Okay, bye.

48:05.082 --> 48:06.913
That's pretty, uh...

48:07.351 --> 48:08.682
I know, right?

48:08.752 --> 48:10.879
That's African
fertility sculpture.

48:10.954 --> 48:12.751
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful.

48:16.226 --> 48:17.386
The wood speaks to me.

48:17.461 --> 48:19.520
The wood speaks to you?

48:25.736 --> 48:28.933
Ladies and gentlemen,
the new S.H.I.T. Line.

48:35.479 --> 48:36.571
Thank you.

48:37.814 --> 48:39.805
What is learning?
It's paying attention!

48:39.883 --> 48:44.547
It's opening yourself up to this great
big ball of shit that we call life!

48:44.621 --> 48:47.988
And what's the worst thing that
can happen? You get bit in the ass!

48:48.058 --> 48:51.494
Well, let me tell you, my
ass looks like hamburger meat...

48:51.561 --> 48:53.620
...but I can still sit down!

48:57.968 --> 48:59.663
I can't believe
this is a class.

48:59.736 --> 49:00.725
Yeah.

49:10.814 --> 49:12.008
Look what I did.

49:12.683 --> 49:14.344
Ugh. What are those?

49:14.418 --> 49:15.783
I call 'em GlenWads.

49:15.852 --> 49:18.821
They contain every delicious flavor
in every single bite. Try one.

49:18.889 --> 49:20.584
I'm not gonna lie to you.
They look disgusting.

49:20.657 --> 49:22.818
This shit will get you high
on flavor alone.

49:22.893 --> 49:25.555
Glen, I love
your Wads. Hmm.

49:25.629 --> 49:26.618
Glen.

49:26.697 --> 49:29.860
This is like the most... Literally the
most incredible thing I've ever eaten.

49:30.334 --> 49:31.892
Heads up, bro.

49:32.069 --> 49:33.058
Whoa.

49:33.570 --> 49:37.734
And it's so easy to swallow. Mmm. Wow, Glen.

49:37.808 --> 49:39.639
Uh, excuse me. Thanks, buddy.
Sure.

49:40.277 --> 49:41.642
Hey, how's it going?
Hey.

49:41.712 --> 49:43.304
Can I help you with something?

49:43.380 --> 49:45.143
Aren't you that guy?

49:45.549 --> 49:47.039
No, I don't think so.

49:47.117 --> 49:49.085
You're not?
I'm not what?

49:49.152 --> 49:51.177
I saw you at rush.
What are you doing here?

49:51.254 --> 49:53.586
I'm eating a Wad, man.
What are you doing here?

49:54.224 --> 49:55.384
Wait... wait, let me guess.

49:55.459 --> 49:57.552
You want me
to sign your petition...

49:57.627 --> 50:00.460
...banning minorities
from your yacht club. No?

50:00.864 --> 50:02.354
I am the chairman,
actually...

50:02.432 --> 50:04.696
...of the Student Community Outreach
Committee at Harmon College.

50:04.768 --> 50:06.827
Ah! That was my next guess.
My next guess.

50:06.903 --> 50:08.097
That sounds very important.

50:08.171 --> 50:09.934
As a matter of fact, it is!
That's why I said it.

50:10.007 --> 50:11.304
And Harmon wants
to buy this property...

50:11.375 --> 50:14.435
...so do you know where I
could find the lease holder?

50:14.511 --> 50:15.671
I do.

50:19.449 --> 50:21.007
Well, could you tell me?

50:21.084 --> 50:23.416
Oh, yeah, I could.
I could, Gunther.

50:23.487 --> 50:25.011
Okay, well,
are you going to tell me?

50:25.088 --> 50:27.022
No. I'm not gonna tell you.
I will tell you this.

50:27.090 --> 50:29.581
The lease holder's not interested
in relocating at any point.

50:29.659 --> 50:31.786
So thanks for asking,
and have a good day.

50:31.862 --> 50:34.057
And enjoy the game show
that you host. Bye-bye.

50:34.131 --> 50:35.428
Oh, look out.

50:35.499 --> 50:36.898
Open it.

50:36.967 --> 50:39.458
Ah. Thank you for coming by.

50:39.536 --> 50:42.403
Have a good day.
I'm gonna go enjoy my Wad.

50:44.841 --> 50:47.207
Hey! What the hell
is this place?

50:47.911 --> 50:51.039
South Harmon Institute of
Technology. The best college ever.

51:02.626 --> 51:03.820
Is this a test?

51:08.598 --> 51:10.259
Hey, Sperminator.

51:15.005 --> 51:16.336
South Harmon?

51:16.406 --> 51:17.634
Knock, knock.

51:18.842 --> 51:19.866
Oh, hey, Gwynn.

51:19.943 --> 51:22.411
Hey. Hey, what are you doing
up here all by your lonesome?

51:22.479 --> 51:24.379
You know, you're
missing the whole party.

51:24.448 --> 51:27.940
Hey, have you ever heard of the
South Harmon Institute of Technology?

51:28.018 --> 51:29.576
No. How come?

51:30.720 --> 51:31.778
No reason.

51:31.855 --> 51:33.755
Hey, pledge.

51:34.057 --> 51:36.150
Hello, knights of freedom.

51:36.226 --> 51:39.059
Sperman, do you know
why you're dressed like this?

51:39.129 --> 51:41.188
Because it's required
for brotherhood.

51:41.832 --> 51:43.697
Drink this.
Okay.

51:43.767 --> 51:45.064
No, wait.

51:48.738 --> 51:49.932
There you go.

51:50.140 --> 51:51.903
Good addition, sir.

52:02.552 --> 52:05.112
Hey, Hoyt.
Hey, what are you doin'?

52:06.690 --> 52:08.180
Oh-oh. Hoyt.

52:09.759 --> 52:11.590
Monica. Hold on. Shit!

52:17.467 --> 52:20.265
Harmon Gateway, my ass.
Let me tell you something.

52:20.337 --> 52:24.296
That's the kind of group-think mob
mentality that's dumbing down America...

52:24.374 --> 52:26.205
...and flushing your brains
down the toilet.

52:26.276 --> 52:29.074
B! We have a problem.

52:32.549 --> 52:33.709
Virgin daiquiri.

52:33.783 --> 52:35.876
And easy on the lime there,
Eraserhead.

52:35.952 --> 52:37.146
Comin' right up.

52:37.220 --> 52:39.518
Lizzie.
What are you doing here?

52:39.589 --> 52:43.184
You mean I can't swing by and
visit my big brother at college?

52:43.260 --> 52:45.490
You are in college,
aren't you?

52:46.029 --> 52:47.121
What is that
supposed to mean?

52:47.197 --> 52:49.324
Come on, Bartleby.
The jig's up.

52:49.399 --> 52:51.264
I'm telling Mom and Dad.

52:51.334 --> 52:53.199
Uh, listen,
w- w-what do you want?

52:53.270 --> 52:54.430
$20,000.

52:54.504 --> 52:57.029
What? No way!
That's insane. Come on.

52:57.107 --> 52:58.506
I'm not gonna
play your little game.

52:58.575 --> 52:59.803
I'm not gonna
give you a cent.

52:59.876 --> 53:02.208
How do you like that? How
do you like them apples, huh?

53:02.279 --> 53:04.247
Fortunately, Mom and Dad
are on speed dial.

53:04.314 --> 53:06.043
Oh. I'll ask them to pick me up here.

53:06.116 --> 53:08.584
Okay, you're gonna call
Mom and Dad, sure. Ringing.

53:08.652 --> 53:09.846
You are bluffing
with the best.

53:09.920 --> 53:11.581
You're very good, though.
I gotta give it to you.

53:11.655 --> 53:12.781
Hi, Mom.
Okay, stop it.

53:12.856 --> 53:14.118
Anything you want,
not money-related.

53:14.191 --> 53:15.215
Your Razor scooter.
Done.

53:15.292 --> 53:17.157
And a fake ID.
No! That's ridiculous.

53:17.227 --> 53:18.626
I'm not gonna let you drink.

53:18.695 --> 53:20.720
It's so I can vote, dumbass.

53:21.431 --> 53:23.331
Oh. Okay, deal.

53:25.569 --> 53:27.537
You need a Razor scooter
to vote?

53:29.072 --> 53:30.505
What do you mean,
they're a college?

53:30.574 --> 53:32.701
They're called the South
Harmon Institute of Technology.

53:32.776 --> 53:34.801
The South Harmon
Institute of Technology?

53:34.878 --> 53:36.743
What is this,
some kind of joke?

53:36.813 --> 53:38.405
No, I don't think it is, sir.

53:38.481 --> 53:40.210
Mr. Ambrose,
that is the one building...

53:40.283 --> 53:42.444
...standing between me
and the Van Horne Gateway.

53:42.519 --> 53:44.077
Well, I don't know
what to tell you, sir.

53:44.154 --> 53:45.781
Tell me that
you're not that naive.

53:45.855 --> 53:48.847
Colleges don't just spring up
out of the ground overnight.

53:48.925 --> 53:50.051
You're right.
You're right, sir.

53:50.126 --> 53:51.787
I know I'm right!

53:52.262 --> 53:54.822
All right, don't worry. I'll... I'll
figure a way to get them out of there.

53:54.898 --> 53:56.889
What an excellent idea,
Mr. Ambrose.

53:56.967 --> 53:59.936
That's the kind of thinking that
will get you into law school.

54:27.397 --> 54:29.058
Coming through!

54:29.132 --> 54:30.156
Ow!

54:44.681 --> 54:45.739
Hey, what are you
doing here?

54:45.815 --> 54:48.283
I just came to thank you
so much for my camera, B.

54:48.351 --> 54:50.012
It was so sweet, thank you.

54:50.086 --> 54:53.180
Come on. Please, I figured, who
needs a life's savings, right?

54:53.256 --> 54:55.622
Actually, I had a really
hard time finding this place.

54:55.692 --> 54:57.182
You... You guys aren't listed
in the phone book...

54:57.260 --> 54:59.125
...and nobody really seems
to know about you guys.

54:59.195 --> 55:01.663
Yeah, yeah, we're... we're
a pretty well-kept secret.

55:01.731 --> 55:03.824
Well, let me... Let me show
you the rest of the place.

55:03.900 --> 55:04.958
Sure. Really?

55:05.035 --> 55:06.127
Yeah, of course.
Okay.

55:06.202 --> 55:07.260
Great.
Great.

55:07.337 --> 55:09.396
Let's, let's go.
All right.

55:10.407 --> 55:12.068
Two lava flows.
Thank you.

55:12.142 --> 55:13.507
And keep your voice down.
People are playing.

55:13.576 --> 55:16.272
Okay. Thanks, buddy. Mmm.
Oh, okay. Thank you.

55:16.346 --> 55:18.143
He makes a mean drink.
Yeah. It's great.

55:18.214 --> 55:19.579
All right. Hello.

55:19.649 --> 55:21.139
<i>How do you like your drink?</i>

55:21.217 --> 55:23.276
Yeah, it's really good, Glen.
Thanks.

55:23.353 --> 55:24.377
<i>Does she like hers?</i>

55:24.454 --> 55:25.785
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, she...

55:25.855 --> 55:26.981
Yeah, it's great.
Thank you.

55:27.057 --> 55:28.319
<i>Okay, great, thanks.
Okay, pal. Okay.</i>

55:28.391 --> 55:29.756
Ah, Glen.

55:30.026 --> 55:31.789
Wait. So this is
your course guide?

55:31.861 --> 55:33.055
Yeah, this is
a new pilot program.

55:33.129 --> 55:34.994
See, the administration wanted
us to create our own classes...

55:35.065 --> 55:37.226
...so we just, uh,
write 'em on the board.

55:37.300 --> 55:38.460
Really?
Yeah.

55:38.535 --> 55:39.729
Wow, that's so cool, B.

55:39.803 --> 55:41.065
Hey, why don't you sign up for one? No, no.

55:41.137 --> 55:42.661
Come on. Sign up for one.
No. No, Bartleby, no.

55:42.739 --> 55:44.331
It... It's painless. I insist.
Oh, really?

55:44.407 --> 55:46.341
Even if you don't sign up for
one you'll go on a fun ride.

55:46.409 --> 55:47.706
Okay.

55:47.777 --> 55:49.472
Just stop me when you see
something that you like.

55:49.546 --> 55:52.572
Okay. Oh, I like this one.
"Men: The Weaker Sex. "

55:52.649 --> 55:53.980
Give me a pen.
Oh.

55:54.050 --> 55:57.508
B, there can't honestly be a
class called "Bullshitting 236."

55:57.887 --> 56:00.720
What about "The Decline
and Fall of Chevy Chase"?

56:00.824 --> 56:02.086
There's a wait list
for that one.

56:07.263 --> 56:08.355
What?

56:09.432 --> 56:10.660
Are... Are you okay?

56:10.734 --> 56:11.860
What?

56:12.268 --> 56:13.667
What the hell happened?

56:13.737 --> 56:15.227
An explosion of flavor!

56:15.305 --> 56:17.739
I'm working with some
very unstable herbs!

56:18.808 --> 56:20.469
Wait, wait, wait.
So you're telling me...

56:20.543 --> 56:22.977
...that there are no tests,
or essays...

56:23.546 --> 56:25.946
...or required reading,
or any of that nonsense?

56:26.015 --> 56:28.006
That's what I'm sayin'. Wow. Ever?

56:28.084 --> 56:29.278
Yeah. Never ever.

56:29.352 --> 56:31.115
Ask me about my wiener!
That's amazing.

56:31.187 --> 56:32.814
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

56:33.356 --> 56:34.846
Oh, no.

56:34.924 --> 56:36.824
Ask me about my wiener!

56:38.328 --> 56:39.659
What the...

56:39.729 --> 56:42.425
Ask me about my wiener!

56:44.567 --> 56:45.659
Schrader?

56:45.735 --> 56:46.963
Oh, hey, B. Hi.

56:47.036 --> 56:48.128
And Monica.

56:48.371 --> 56:50.430
Hey. Why... Why are you wearing this?

56:50.507 --> 56:53.408
Every single brother in my
fraternity has worn this suit.

56:53.476 --> 56:55.910
President James Garfield wore
this suit like a gentleman.

56:55.979 --> 56:57.207
Oh, yeah,
and look what happened to him.

56:57.280 --> 56:59.578
He got assassinated
by Charles Guiteau.

56:59.649 --> 57:01.617
Don't ask me
how I know that.

57:01.684 --> 57:03.811
Do me a favor, ask me about
my wiener really quickly.

57:03.887 --> 57:05.184
Schrader, no.

57:05.255 --> 57:07.018
Guys, my brothers could be
watching me right now.

57:07.090 --> 57:08.614
Just ask me
about my wiener, please.

57:09.692 --> 57:11.683
Why are you doing this? What do you mean?

57:11.761 --> 57:13.228
Come on. You're...
This...

57:13.563 --> 57:15.087
You're humiliating
yourself, buddy.

57:15.165 --> 57:17.326
You know what, B.
Don't mess with me!

57:17.400 --> 57:19.425
These are the happiest times
of my life, all right?

57:19.502 --> 57:22.130
Schrader. I'm so happy, I'm the happiest.

57:22.205 --> 57:23.331
I'm happy!

57:24.674 --> 57:26.835
Hey! Ask me about my wiener!

57:27.677 --> 57:29.144
<i>S.H.I.T. Rag.
Hot off the presses.</i>

57:30.246 --> 57:31.804
Here you go, B.
Thanks, Boner.

57:31.881 --> 57:32.939
<i>The S.H.I.T. Rag?</i>

57:33.016 --> 57:34.415
Yeah, come on, every school's
gotta have a paper.

57:34.484 --> 57:37.112
There's a great op-ed piece in there
about not believing everything you read.

57:37.220 --> 57:38.312
It's really provocative.

57:38.388 --> 57:42.222
As your de facto consigliere my advice
to you is to shut this down immediately.

57:42.292 --> 57:44.021
And my advice to you
is to stop worrying...

57:44.093 --> 57:45.526
...before you
spontaneously combust.

57:45.595 --> 57:46.926
Yes, but you can't
just do this.

57:46.996 --> 57:48.190
To be a real college...

57:48.264 --> 57:50.027
...you have to go through the
appropriate legal channels.

57:50.099 --> 57:51.191
You need to be accredited.

57:51.267 --> 57:52.894
Well, yeah,
could you take care of that?

57:52.969 --> 57:55.904
Hey, B.
Pancho, looking good, pal.

57:56.206 --> 57:57.230
Who's that?
Spank me.

57:57.307 --> 57:58.774
That's, uh, the mascot.

57:59.042 --> 58:00.407
Oh, it's the mascot?
Yeah.

58:00.477 --> 58:01.705
A sandwich?
Yes.

58:01.778 --> 58:04.338
You're the S.H.I.T. Sandwiches? Yes, we are.

58:04.414 --> 58:06.507
You are taking this
way too far.

58:06.583 --> 58:08.642
How so?
Oh, I don't know, man.

58:08.718 --> 58:10.913
Maybe it's the pool,
or the half-pipe.

58:11.020 --> 58:13.580
That's not in the budget. I'm
re-investing in their education.

58:13.656 --> 58:15.556
Those are South Harmon
cornerstones there.

58:15.625 --> 58:17.490
Yes, but you're overlooking
zoning requirements...

58:17.560 --> 58:19.551
...noise permits,
there are insurance issues.

58:19.629 --> 58:22.393
Come on. Insurance?
What's gonna happen?

58:30.340 --> 58:31.898
Oh, shit.

58:35.345 --> 58:36.369
Wow.

58:36.813 --> 58:38.144
Yeah!

58:38.381 --> 58:39.712
Aw, shit.

58:40.316 --> 58:43.251
We gotta do it again, dudes.
Left the lens cap on.

58:43.319 --> 58:45.253
No, you didn't!
Damn!

58:46.756 --> 58:49.122
You know what? You're absolutely
right. This has gone way too far.

58:49.192 --> 58:52.184
And I think we need to do
something about it ASAP.

58:52.262 --> 58:54.059
Thank you.
Thank you.

59:13.216 --> 59:14.683
Is this great
or is this great?

59:14.751 --> 59:16.480
It's pretty cool, man,
but I gotta go.

59:16.553 --> 59:19.681
The Roaring '20s is B.K.E.'s
biggest party of the year.

59:19.756 --> 59:21.690
<i>And we're recreating the
scene from The Untouchables...</i>

59:21.758 --> 59:23.885
...where Roy,
as Bobby De Niro...

59:23.960 --> 59:25.860
...crushes my skull
with a baseball bat.

59:25.929 --> 59:27.692
Wow, what an
incredible honor.

59:27.764 --> 59:29.857
Could you sign a copy
of your book for me?

59:29.933 --> 59:32.663
I got it on eBay.
They sell my shit on eBay?

59:32.735 --> 59:34.293
You wrote a book?
Yeah.

59:34.370 --> 59:36.099
But that was back
when I was drinking.

59:36.172 --> 59:39.573
Come on, Glen, you can't
keep stringing us along.

59:39.642 --> 59:41.974
Which one of us
is it going to be?

59:55.258 --> 59:58.125
<i>Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Quiet, shh!</i>

59:58.261 --> 01:00:01.162
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, let's give
it up for your fearless leader...</i>

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:03.255
<i>Bartleby Gaines.
Come on up here, buddy!</i>

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.962
Aw, man.

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:06.797
<i>Thanks. Thank you.
Get up here!</i>

01:00:06.869 --> 01:00:08.666
<i>Come on up!
I know you know this one!</i>

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:11.434
Go. Go up there right now.
Go, man, go!

01:00:14.177 --> 01:00:16.577
How you doin'?
Yeah! You the man.

01:00:50.747 --> 01:00:52.681
I'm going
to have that.

01:00:53.016 --> 01:00:54.142
Shut up.

01:00:54.217 --> 01:00:56.208
Look, where the hell
is everybody at?

01:00:56.285 --> 01:00:57.650
You! Hey.

01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.415
Hey.
How are you?

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:02.481
Aw, God, look,
where the hell is everybody?

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:04.692
This is the biggest
party of the year, guys.

01:01:06.129 --> 01:01:07.255
Band, hey!

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:09.798
Ah, you want to start
playing some music, please?

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.262
Hey.
Hoyt, hey.

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:14.997
There's, like, some big party
down the hill.

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:17.999
Oh, that son of a...

01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:40.356
Hey! B, oh, my gosh, that was fantastic.

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:41.761
Aw, my God, you saw that.
I'm embarrassed.

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:42.855
I don't know
what happened to me.

01:01:42.932 --> 01:01:46.265
Someone possessed me, and... And it was
the spirit of Johnny Ramone, I think.

01:01:46.335 --> 01:01:49.065
B, is there anything that
you're not incredibly amazing at?

01:01:49.138 --> 01:01:50.162
Yeah, it's funny
you should ask.

01:01:50.239 --> 01:01:51.968
There are very few things
I'm not very good at.

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:55.067
Off the top of my head I can think
of spelunking, uh, telekinesis...

01:01:55.144 --> 01:01:56.771
<i>...not crying at
the end of My Girl.</i>

01:01:56.846 --> 01:01:59.007
It gets me.
And dairy products.

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:01.209
Which is good, because you
know I'm not really in the mood...

01:02:01.284 --> 01:02:03.047
...for any
dairy products tonight.

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:05.877
Well, let's see if we can
get you something else then.

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:07.752
Let's see.
All right.

01:02:09.325 --> 01:02:10.986
This is my... Oh!
Ooh!

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:13.221
I'm okay, I'm okay. I keep
forgetting this opens out.

01:02:13.296 --> 01:02:14.854
It happens all the time,
I gotta get used to it.

01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:16.091
Oh, no.

01:02:16.332 --> 01:02:17.594
And this is...

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:20.097
<i>Mi casa.</i>

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:24.262
Bartleby, uh, oh, my God,
this is amazing!

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:25.671
Huh? It's fine.

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:28.074
I mean, I like it 'cause
it's simple, and functional.

01:02:28.144 --> 01:02:30.840
Provides a good safe workspace
for me to focus on my studies.

01:02:34.117 --> 01:02:38.747
B, this is so cheesy,
in the greatest way.

01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:41.883
There is nothing cheesy
about a clap-on disco ball.

01:02:43.059 --> 01:02:44.117
Maybe it's a little bit much.

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:46.218
I've wanted one
since I was a kid, though.

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:49.128
Wait, is everybody's room at
South Harmon this incredible?

01:02:49.198 --> 01:02:50.460
Well, at South Harmon
you're free...

01:02:50.533 --> 01:02:51.830
...to kind of design
your own rooms, you know?

01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:53.266
Whatever you're thinking,
whatever you're...

01:02:53.336 --> 01:02:55.133
And I was thinking
clap-on disco ball.

01:02:55.371 --> 01:02:57.339
How about that drink?
Can I get you a drink?

01:02:57.406 --> 01:02:59.374
I would love a drink.
All right.

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:03.510
Ah, touché.
Ahh.

01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:23.489
This party's
off the hook!

01:03:23.566 --> 01:03:24.624
Hey, hey, hey, shut up!

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:26.167
All right.
Where is that asshole?

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:29.471
Co-Come on, Bartleby,
that was 7th grade.

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:31.302
Yeah, exactly,
that was my point.

01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:33.467
Well, I will have you know... Oh, now...

01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:36.068
...now I can't go back to your
past, but you can go back to mine.

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:38.875
That Christina Aguilera look did
very well for me, thank you very much.

01:03:38.948 --> 01:03:40.176
Yeah, you did great,
you did great. I know.

01:03:40.249 --> 01:03:42.717
I remember you making out with Pete
Goochman in Julie Posner's basement.

01:03:42.785 --> 01:03:43.843
You were at that party?

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.512
Oh, even if I wasn't there,
I would have known about it.

01:03:45.588 --> 01:03:47.055
It made headline news
at school.

01:03:47.123 --> 01:03:49.284
And... And... And that day
something happened in my life...

01:03:49.358 --> 01:03:51.223
...that I never thought
would happen.

01:03:51.294 --> 01:03:54.354
I became envious of Pete
"The Gooch" Goochman.

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:55.895
Never thought
it would happen.

01:03:55.965 --> 01:03:58.593
But I was like, "He got to
make out with Monica Moreland. "

01:03:58.668 --> 01:04:01.762
Well, if you wanted to kiss me so
bad in the basement, why didn't you?

01:04:01.838 --> 01:04:03.806
Well, 'cause the Gooch
beat me to it...

01:04:03.873 --> 01:04:06.569
...and I was a little shy,
and, uh...

01:04:06.809 --> 01:04:10.040
Well, you want to
kiss me now, don't you?

01:04:20.156 --> 01:04:22.181
You look like Carly Simon!

01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:25.618
If I could bang one woman in
the world it'd be Carly Simon...

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:27.253
...and you look like her!

01:04:27.763 --> 01:04:29.526
Are you having fun?

01:04:29.966 --> 01:04:31.661
I'm having so much fun.

01:04:31.734 --> 01:04:33.463
Let's go find him.
Oh!

01:04:38.207 --> 01:04:40.437
Oh, shit, oh, shit,
oh, shit, oh, shit.

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.938
Sorry. One sec.

01:04:49.785 --> 01:04:52.219
Oh, shit.
Uh, I got a situation.

01:04:52.989 --> 01:04:54.650
Come, come with me.
Okay.

01:05:02.698 --> 01:05:04.666
Hey, have you
seen Schrader?

01:05:05.601 --> 01:05:06.693
Excuse me.

01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:09.531
Shit.

01:05:10.273 --> 01:05:12.571
Monica?
What are you doing here?

01:05:12.642 --> 01:05:15.907
Oh, you know, just picking up
my application for transfer.

01:05:16.646 --> 01:05:18.511
You're telling me that
you're with this guy now?

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:20.708
Actually, Hoyt, um...

01:05:21.784 --> 01:05:24.014
I'm telling you
it's none of your business.

01:05:24.954 --> 01:05:26.444
It's none of my business? Yeah.

01:05:26.522 --> 01:05:28.114
Oh, snap!

01:05:29.091 --> 01:05:31.355
Hey, Hoyt, let me introduce
you to an old friend of mine.

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:34.362
The word "rejection. "
She can be a real bitch.

01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:36.159
But you don't have
to give her roofies.

01:05:36.232 --> 01:05:38.166
So you're not gonna like her. Ooh.

01:05:38.234 --> 01:05:39.997
You want me to give you
something funny to laugh about?

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:42.401
You mean something funnier
than your future alcohol abuse?

01:05:42.471 --> 01:05:43.995
Battle Royale!

01:05:47.743 --> 01:05:49.768
Uh, shit.
Let's go, guys.

01:05:50.446 --> 01:05:52.937
All right, come on, guys.
Let's get out of here.

01:05:53.316 --> 01:05:56.114
Wow, Monica, you really know
how to pick 'em, don't you?

01:05:56.185 --> 01:05:57.516
Have fun with these idiots!

01:05:57.586 --> 01:05:58.746
Bye-bye.
Bye.

01:05:58.821 --> 01:06:00.254
Thank you for comin'.

01:06:00.323 --> 01:06:02.223
Guys, let's get
the music back up! Come on!

01:06:28.684 --> 01:06:30.811
<i>Wet T-shirt party!</i>

01:06:48.871 --> 01:06:49.667
Mom? Dad?

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:57.008
Gwynn.
Hi, there.

01:06:57.913 --> 01:06:59.141
What are you doing here?

01:06:59.215 --> 01:07:00.546
I'm your escort.

01:07:00.616 --> 01:07:02.641
Induction night,
big guy.

01:07:03.052 --> 01:07:06.510
B.K.E., B.K.E., brotherhood,
brotherhood, you and me!

01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:09.888
B.K.E., B.K.E. Brotherhood,
brotherhood, you and me!

01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:11.756
Sherman Schrader, you rock!

01:07:11.827 --> 01:07:13.727
Aw, no! You guys rock!

01:07:13.796 --> 01:07:15.889
Get ready to be inducted into
the brotherhood, you winner!

01:07:15.965 --> 01:07:19.162
Yes! I want it! I want
everything you guys have. Whoo!

01:07:19.235 --> 01:07:21.669
I want lilac shirts!
I want visors...

01:07:21.737 --> 01:07:25.104
...kind of tilted to the side,
with hair gel coming out of it.

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:27.142
I want to have sex with girls
that look like this!

01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:29.234
You rock!
I know I do!

01:07:29.311 --> 01:07:31.541
You do, yeah, you do.

01:07:32.515 --> 01:07:35.643
Do I get hair gel now, or do
I have to go and buy my own?

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:36.844
Did you crack him?

01:07:36.919 --> 01:07:37.977
No.

01:07:38.921 --> 01:07:40.354
We'll crack him.

01:07:41.323 --> 01:07:44.622
Sherman, do you know how long
that this fraternity has survived?

01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:46.020
Yes, sir.

01:07:46.095 --> 01:07:48.586
153 majestic years, sir.

01:07:48.664 --> 01:07:51.724
That is correct. Because it's
based on the most sacred principle...

01:07:51.801 --> 01:07:53.962
...that brothers can share.

01:07:54.036 --> 01:07:55.230
Trust.

01:07:57.406 --> 01:07:59.374
And seriously, bro, I'm...
I'm beginning to question...

01:07:59.442 --> 01:08:00.739
...whether or not
I can trust you.

01:08:00.843 --> 01:08:03.437
'Cause we know you been hanging out
with those freaks down at the loony bin.

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:05.673
So with your allegiance
being called into question...

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:08.216
I just wanted
to ask you just one thing.

01:08:09.218 --> 01:08:10.480
Paddle.

01:08:10.553 --> 01:08:12.885
That's actually not a question. Shut up!

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:15.383
Are you with them...

01:08:17.893 --> 01:08:19.121
...or are you with us?

01:08:35.411 --> 01:08:36.673
Decent party.

01:08:41.783 --> 01:08:43.649
Okay, I'll give you decent.

01:08:54.697 --> 01:08:57.359
Hey, where is Schrader?
He should be here for this.

01:08:57.433 --> 01:08:58.866
I don't know. I haven't
seen him in a couple of days.

01:08:58.934 --> 01:09:00.196
I hope he's not sick.

01:09:00.368 --> 01:09:02.529
Okay. Quick, quick, quick,
everybody say "Cheers"!

01:09:02.604 --> 01:09:04.232
Hey, "quick, quick, quick,"
get up in here.

01:09:04.305 --> 01:09:05.500
No.
Oh, yes.

01:09:05.573 --> 01:09:08.099
Yes, yes, yes. Come over here. Okay.

01:09:09.712 --> 01:09:11.475
Gotta up
the gorgeous quotient.

01:09:12.113 --> 01:09:14.877
Okay. Get ready and now.

01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:16.917
Cheers!

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.417
Schrader.

01:09:21.624 --> 01:09:23.148
Schrader, come on, open up.

01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:25.451
What are you...

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:27.920
What the hell happened to you?

01:09:30.432 --> 01:09:33.731
Nothing. Just a little ritual
bonding over at the B.K.E. House.

01:09:33.903 --> 01:09:35.564
What?
What are you talking about?

01:09:35.638 --> 01:09:38.300
They kicked my ass, until I
told them all about South Harmon.

01:09:39.041 --> 01:09:40.337
Oh, shit.

01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:43.337
They took my laptop,
the mailing list, everything.

01:09:44.813 --> 01:09:46.609
Shit. Man, I'm sorry.

01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:49.707
All I ever wanted was a
run-of-the-mill college experience.

01:09:49.785 --> 01:09:51.649
But not me, right?
I can't have that.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:52.778
Not me!

01:09:52.854 --> 01:09:54.584
'Cause I'm too busy getting
the shit kicked out of me...

01:09:54.657 --> 01:09:55.988
...and being an accomplice
to fraud!

01:09:56.058 --> 01:09:57.616
Does the run-of-the-mill
college experience...

01:09:57.693 --> 01:09:59.183
...include stripping you
of your dignity?

01:09:59.261 --> 01:10:02.389
Totally humiliating you, making you
wear a... A... A frigging hot dog suit?

01:10:02.464 --> 01:10:03.988
It's a tradition.
A tradition?

01:10:04.066 --> 01:10:05.658
Yes. I got a tradition for you.

01:10:05.734 --> 01:10:08.999
Schrader, you've been my best
friend since we were 5 years old.

01:10:09.071 --> 01:10:10.800
That's the only tradition
I know.

01:10:20.816 --> 01:10:23.011
I just messed up.
I really messed up.

01:10:23.085 --> 01:10:24.848
How? What happened?

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:26.248
With Schrader.

01:10:26.322 --> 01:10:28.085
I know Bartleby
is by the pool.

01:10:28.157 --> 01:10:29.249
Oh, my God.

01:10:29.425 --> 01:10:30.585
What is it? Cops?

01:10:30.659 --> 01:10:32.559
Worse. Parents.

01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:36.830
Mom! Dad! Great!

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:38.590
Hey, guys.

01:10:38.667 --> 01:10:40.464
Bartleby! Hiya, kid!

01:10:40.769 --> 01:10:42.794
Hey, oh, it's so good
to see you!

01:10:42.871 --> 01:10:45.305
Oh, it's great to see you.
Ow. You look thin.

01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:47.774
There's five good ones right
there for my college boy, huh?

01:10:47.843 --> 01:10:49.174
Hey, hey, Dad.

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:51.907
Wha... What... What... What
are you doing here?

01:10:52.014 --> 01:10:53.038
Well, Parents' Day.

01:10:53.449 --> 01:10:55.508
What a wonderful idea on the
part of the college, you know?

01:10:55.584 --> 01:10:57.211
Yeah.
Oh, right.

01:10:57.353 --> 01:10:59.446
Parents' Day.
Of course.

01:10:59.521 --> 01:11:02.285
Hello, everyone.
Now, welcome to Parents' Day.

01:11:02.358 --> 01:11:04.553
And, uh, we're very glad
you could be here.

01:11:04.627 --> 01:11:07.528
Um, we have a wonderful
guided tour planned...

01:11:07.596 --> 01:11:09.325
...a- Around the grounds
and the campus...

01:11:09.398 --> 01:11:11.059
Show you what we've been
working on all year.

01:11:11.133 --> 01:11:12.760
So, welcome one and all.
Excuse me, everyone.

01:11:12.835 --> 01:11:13.961
May I have
your attention, please?

01:11:14.036 --> 01:11:15.264
Oh, shit.

01:11:15.337 --> 01:11:16.668
I knew I smelled bacon.

01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:18.736
My name is Richard Van Horne.

01:11:18.807 --> 01:11:19.831
Oh, Van Horne, yes.

01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:22.433
The... The dean of Harmon
College, our big sister school.

01:11:22.511 --> 01:11:24.479
Give him a round of applause.
He's earned it.

01:11:24.546 --> 01:11:26.571
Thank you for comin' by.
Great to see him here.

01:11:26.649 --> 01:11:28.116
They are our
big sister school...

01:11:28.183 --> 01:11:30.413
...and we are honored
by their presence.

01:11:30.486 --> 01:11:34.149
Thank you for that nice introduction,
young man, but the joke is over.

01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:35.918
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:11:35.991 --> 01:11:38.255
South Harmon
Institute of Technology...

01:11:38.327 --> 01:11:40.852
...is not the sister school
of Harmon...

01:11:41.063 --> 01:11:42.655
...or of anything else,
for that matter.

01:11:42.731 --> 01:11:44.494
More like cousins.
Thank you for coming.

01:11:44.566 --> 01:11:46.966
It is not accredited.
Any...

01:11:47.102 --> 01:11:50.071
Nor is it truly
an educational institution.

01:11:52.474 --> 01:11:53.907
Is this true, Bartleby?

01:11:55.177 --> 01:11:57.668
It is a sham, a fraud...

01:11:57.946 --> 01:12:00.642
...that undermines the efforts
of real colleges everywhere...

01:12:00.716 --> 01:12:02.343
...and I invite you
to confirm that...

01:12:02.418 --> 01:12:04.750
...with the State Board
of Accreditation.

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:07.084
To all those students
who have been duped...

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:09.488
...good luck applying
to schools next year.

01:12:09.558 --> 01:12:13.790
And to Mr. Gaines I say you will
be hearing from our attorneys.

01:12:17.066 --> 01:12:20.399
Wow, Parents' Day. Man, I wish
I would have thought of that.

01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:23.228
Oh, that's right, I did.

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:24.830
Oh, and by the way...

01:12:24.907 --> 01:12:26.568
...if you, uh, if you see
that lease holder of yours...

01:12:26.642 --> 01:12:28.234
...will you tell him that his
lease automatically breaks...

01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:30.278
...when he's found
guilty of fraud?

01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:31.643
Cool. Thanks, D.

01:12:31.714 --> 01:12:33.204
Er, was it G?

01:12:33.649 --> 01:12:35.514
That's right, it's F.
See you, F.

01:12:38.387 --> 01:12:40.116
Guys, I can explain.
Mmm-mmm.

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:43.681
You have done some stupid
things in your life, Bartleby...

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:45.492
...but this...

01:12:45.961 --> 01:12:48.828
You get your stuff together.
You meet us in the car.

01:12:49.164 --> 01:12:50.722
This is unconscionable.

01:12:53.502 --> 01:12:54.491
Ridiculous.

01:12:56.905 --> 01:12:57.997
Hey.

01:13:00.442 --> 01:13:01.602
So...

01:13:03.312 --> 01:13:04.973
...none of this was real?

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:06.344
That's not true.

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:10.282
Wait, Monica. Monica, wait.

01:13:10.652 --> 01:13:11.880
Monica.

01:13:15.657 --> 01:13:17.022
Sorry, man.

01:13:17.092 --> 01:13:18.889
It's cool. We tried.

01:15:12.841 --> 01:15:14.240
Have you completely
lost your mind?

01:15:14.309 --> 01:15:17.073
Guys, the state defines
a college as a body of people...

01:15:17.145 --> 01:15:19.511
...with a shared common purpose
of a higher education.

01:15:19.581 --> 01:15:20.707
Well that's us, isn't it?

01:15:20.782 --> 01:15:23.148
I mean, you know, with the word
"higher" kind of loosely defined.

01:15:23.218 --> 01:15:25.982
Uh, yeah.
He's completely lost his mind.

01:15:26.054 --> 01:15:27.749
No, no. Listen,
all we have to do...

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:29.450
...is go before
the state accrediting board...

01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:31.720
...with a licensed administrator,
and just present our case.

01:15:31.793 --> 01:15:34.284
B, look, let's just cut
our losses, okay?

01:15:34.897 --> 01:15:36.421
What are we
talking about here, huh?

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:37.829
We're talking about
a stupid piece of paper.

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.197
I mean,
if a stupid piece of paper...

01:15:39.268 --> 01:15:41.168
...is what's gonna
make us acceptable...

01:15:41.236 --> 01:15:43.033
...then let's go for it.
Why not?

01:15:43.105 --> 01:15:45.573
'Cause you gotta remember, it's
not just about us anymore, okay?

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:47.700
It's about everyone
who went to South Harmon.

01:15:49.311 --> 01:15:51.006
Ah, great speech.

01:15:51.346 --> 01:15:53.439
I was inspired,
I felt inspired by it.

01:15:53.615 --> 01:15:55.549
Thanks a lot,
I'm... I'm taking it on tour.

01:15:55.617 --> 01:15:56.709
What are you doing here?

01:15:56.785 --> 01:15:59.447
Aw, I don't know. I had...
I had to pick up some stuff.

01:15:59.521 --> 01:16:02.820
Some sage. Eggplant.
Olive oil. Some Funyuns.

01:16:04.192 --> 01:16:05.386
Wait a minute.

01:16:05.494 --> 01:16:06.756
Come on!

01:16:06.828 --> 01:16:09.058
You're the one that applied
for accreditation, aren't you?

01:16:09.131 --> 01:16:11.395
Well, someone had
to do it, you know?

01:16:11.466 --> 01:16:13.491
We all can't live
with our heads up our asses.

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:15.730
I disagree.
I... I don't get it, man.

01:16:15.804 --> 01:16:17.362
You said you didn't wanna
be a part of this thing.

01:16:17.439 --> 01:16:19.304
I didn't want to have
anything to do with it.

01:16:19.374 --> 01:16:22.571
I wanted to be the fourth generation
of Schrader to go to Harmon.

01:16:22.644 --> 01:16:23.736
But then I realized...

01:16:23.812 --> 01:16:26.337
I would much rather be the
first generation of Schrader...

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:29.009
...to go to the South Harmon
Institute of Technology.

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:30.483
I said it, okay?
I said it.

01:16:30.552 --> 01:16:32.110
So you're saying...

01:16:32.187 --> 01:16:33.916
...you're saying
you want to be a S.H.I.T. Head?

01:16:34.389 --> 01:16:36.721
I'm sayin' I want to be
a S.H.I.T. Head.

01:16:36.792 --> 01:16:37.816
I wanna be a S.H.I.T. Head.

01:16:37.893 --> 01:16:39.918
Yeah, man, well, it's good
to have you back, buddy.

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:42.124
Yes.
Yeah!

01:16:42.197 --> 01:16:43.255
Yay!

01:16:43.332 --> 01:16:44.526
All right,
so we're doing it.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:47.228
Thanks to this S.H.I.T. Head,
we got a hearing set for Friday.

01:16:54.209 --> 01:16:55.369
Don't sweat it, kid.
I'm all over it.

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:57.173
All right, please remember,
Ben, this is serious, all right?

01:16:57.245 --> 01:16:58.405
If this doesn't work,
I'm going to prison.

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.675
Oh, don't worry, you're
young. Your butt can take it.

01:17:00.749 --> 01:17:02.842
Hello, sir. Um,
we're from South Harmon.

01:17:02.918 --> 01:17:05.011
We have a 3:00
in Hearing Room A.

01:17:05.087 --> 01:17:08.386
Okay, actually your meeting room's
been changed to the Grand Hall.

01:17:08.457 --> 01:17:10.618
Why the change?
It's bigger.

01:17:16.999 --> 01:17:18.796
How did they...
Rory called them.

01:17:18.867 --> 01:17:19.925
The whole school?

01:17:20.002 --> 01:17:21.469
I had to do something.

01:17:23.672 --> 01:17:26.334
This meeting of the State Board
of Education will come to order.

01:17:26.408 --> 01:17:29.468
Today we'll be hearing
the case for accreditation...

01:17:29.544 --> 01:17:32.240
...for the South Harmon
Institute of Technology.

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:35.147
Your case for accreditation
is being contested...

01:17:35.217 --> 01:17:36.946
...by Dean Richard Van Horne...

01:17:37.019 --> 01:17:38.577
...representing Harmon College.

01:17:43.325 --> 01:17:44.758
Loser. Loser.

01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:47.727
In order to become accredited...

01:17:48.163 --> 01:17:50.723
...a school must meet
three requirements.

01:17:50.799 --> 01:17:54.257
You must have a facility,
a curriculum and a faculty.

01:17:55.103 --> 01:17:56.536
Please state your case.

01:17:56.872 --> 01:17:58.430
You're on, kid.

01:17:59.007 --> 01:18:01.441
What? Wha... I thought you were
gonna handle this. What are you doing?

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:03.705
Rule number one,
lead with your star witness.

01:18:03.779 --> 01:18:06.873
Nobody knows South Harmon and
these kids better than you.

01:18:06.948 --> 01:18:08.643
So, it's showtime.

01:18:08.717 --> 01:18:10.275
Let's kick some ass.

01:18:10.652 --> 01:18:13.177
You're gonna be great, man.
Just go do your thing.

01:18:13.555 --> 01:18:15.147
Sling some bull.

01:18:15.991 --> 01:18:17.253
Oh, God.

01:18:17.793 --> 01:18:18.919
Okay.

01:18:19.861 --> 01:18:21.089
Uh...

01:18:22.097 --> 01:18:24.588
...ladies and gentlemen of the panel,
thank you for meeting with us.

01:18:24.666 --> 01:18:27.965
Um, my name's Bartleby Gaines
and I'm the co-founder of...

01:18:28.036 --> 01:18:29.765
South Harmon
Institute of Technology.

01:18:41.116 --> 01:18:43.175
Sorry. Friends of mine.

01:18:43.952 --> 01:18:45.749
Um, I'm... I'm sorry,
first of all...

01:18:45.821 --> 01:18:47.345
...w- what were those
three things that you listed?

01:18:47.422 --> 01:18:50.186
A facility, a curriculum
and a faculty.

01:18:50.258 --> 01:18:51.350
Facility, right.

01:18:51.426 --> 01:18:53.291
Okay, well,
we definitely have a facility.

01:18:53.361 --> 01:18:56.421
Uh, we have a common room,
we have dorm rooms.

01:18:56.798 --> 01:18:58.527
Uh, we have
a skateboard ramp.

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.090
We got a tiki bar. Umm...

01:19:00.168 --> 01:19:02.830
They have leased
an old mental hospital.

01:19:02.938 --> 01:19:05.133
They have none of the
traditional support facilities...

01:19:05.207 --> 01:19:06.299
...or resources.

01:19:06.374 --> 01:19:09.775
Mr. Gaines, do you have a
formal athletic facility?

01:19:09.845 --> 01:19:12.109
Okay, uh,
by formal you mean...

01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:16.317
No. No, we don't.

01:19:16.384 --> 01:19:17.749
A library?

01:19:19.688 --> 01:19:20.746
No.

01:19:20.822 --> 01:19:23.017
A health services center?
No.

01:19:24.025 --> 01:19:25.083
No.

01:19:27.529 --> 01:19:28.928
Your curriculum?

01:19:28.997 --> 01:19:30.225
Our curriculum?
Yes.

01:19:30.298 --> 01:19:34.200
Do you have a course book? A comprehensive
list of your available classes?

01:19:34.269 --> 01:19:37.295
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Uh, Sunshine. Can you...

01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:50.716
What is this?

01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:53.619
Our curriculum. These are the
courses we offer at South Harmon.

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:57.717
This is a joke.
"Slacking 101"?

01:19:57.793 --> 01:20:00.057
Uh, tell me, Mr. Gaines...

01:20:00.128 --> 01:20:02.323
...how does one major
in bumper stickers?

01:20:02.998 --> 01:20:04.022
Sir, um...

01:20:04.099 --> 01:20:05.191
I'm sorry, Mr. Gaines.

01:20:05.267 --> 01:20:07.497
I fail to see any merit...

01:20:07.569 --> 01:20:11.027
...or scholastic value in
anything listed on that board.

01:20:11.506 --> 01:20:13.906
Okay, uh, guys,
you want to help me out here?

01:20:13.975 --> 01:20:16.000
In "Taking A Walk
and Thinking About Stuff,"

01:20:16.077 --> 01:20:18.102
...we get to think about what
we want to do with our lives...

01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:19.875
...in a stress-free environment.

01:20:20.348 --> 01:20:23.806
"Let It Speak To You 202" is an art
class in which we discover our talents...

01:20:23.885 --> 01:20:26.183
...by examining our
personal life experiences.

01:20:26.254 --> 01:20:29.519
In "Skateboarding 234" we built a ramp
that teaches us about engineering...

01:20:29.591 --> 01:20:31.252
And physics.
And aerodynamics.

01:20:31.326 --> 01:20:33.226
In "Rock Our Faces Off 222"

01:20:33.295 --> 01:20:36.662
...we listen to the music and
lyrical angst of a lost generation.

01:20:36.965 --> 01:20:38.330
And we rock our faces off.

01:20:43.471 --> 01:20:44.665
They do.

01:20:47.042 --> 01:20:49.374
Do you have
faculty present?

01:20:49.811 --> 01:20:50.937
Yes, we do, sir.

01:20:51.913 --> 01:20:53.471
Faculty, stand.

01:20:57.385 --> 01:20:58.784
What is the meaning
of this?

01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:00.947
See, at South Harmon, sir,
the students are the teachers.

01:21:01.022 --> 01:21:02.887
Aw, this is preposterous.

01:21:02.958 --> 01:21:05.984
Students are not
and cannot be teachers.

01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:07.423
Dean Van Horne
is right.

01:21:07.495 --> 01:21:11.693
You must have a faculty as defined by
the state, or you cannot be accredited.

01:21:15.937 --> 01:21:19.964
Mr. Gaines, have you
employed a faculty or not?

01:21:23.945 --> 01:21:25.071
Um...

01:21:28.283 --> 01:21:29.580
Present and accounted for.

01:21:29.651 --> 01:21:30.709
Oh, for God's sake.

01:21:30.785 --> 01:21:34.585
Dr. Alexander, this man has not been
a part of academia for three decades.

01:21:34.656 --> 01:21:37.090
We were on the faculty together
at Harmon in our late 20s...

01:21:37.158 --> 01:21:38.386
...and he washed out.

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:41.452
He's a drunk, he's a degenerate,
and he's looney tunes.

01:21:41.529 --> 01:21:44.089
Hey, asshole! You're talking
about my mom's brother!

01:21:44.165 --> 01:21:46.156
Oh, sit down!
Okay.

01:21:46.234 --> 01:21:50.034
Hey! Why don't you take your
PhD and shove it up your A-S-S?

01:21:55.944 --> 01:21:58.606
Settle down
right this minute!

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:01.547
Dean Lewis! Sit down.

01:22:02.517 --> 01:22:03.711
Order!

01:22:05.387 --> 01:22:06.411
Couldn't help myself.

01:22:06.488 --> 01:22:08.513
So, is that it,
Mr. Gaines?

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:12.720
You have one formal teacher
for upwards of 300 students?

01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:16.629
Mr. Gaines.

01:22:17.866 --> 01:22:19.390
Answer the question.

01:22:19.467 --> 01:22:21.059
Nah, I'm not gonna
answer your question...

01:22:21.136 --> 01:22:22.831
'cause you guys have
already made up your minds.

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:23.996
I'm an expert in rejection...

01:22:24.072 --> 01:22:25.733
...and I can see it
on your faces.

01:22:25.807 --> 01:22:28.173
And it's too bad that you
judge us by the way we look...

01:22:28.243 --> 01:22:30.006
...and not by who we are.

01:22:30.078 --> 01:22:31.978
Just because you want us
to be more like them...

01:22:32.047 --> 01:22:33.537
...when the truth is
we're not like them.

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:35.879
And I am damn proud
of that fact.

01:22:38.153 --> 01:22:39.552
Rock on!

01:22:41.089 --> 01:22:42.283
I mean...

01:22:43.191 --> 01:22:46.683
Harmon College and their... And
their 100 years of tradition.

01:22:46.761 --> 01:22:48.251
But tradition of what?

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:49.854
Of hazing kids...

01:22:50.598 --> 01:22:53.192
...and humiliating anyone
who's a little bit different?

01:22:53.268 --> 01:22:54.360
Of putting
so much pressure on kids...

01:22:54.436 --> 01:22:56.666
...they turn into these... These
stress freaks and caffeine addicts.

01:22:56.738 --> 01:22:59.935
Your phony school demeans
real colleges everywhere!

01:23:00.008 --> 01:23:02.875
Why? Why can't
we both exist? Huh?

01:23:02.944 --> 01:23:04.605
You can have your grades,
and your rules...

01:23:04.679 --> 01:23:06.510
...and your structure,
and your ivory towers...

01:23:06.581 --> 01:23:07.707
...and then we'll do things
our way.

01:23:07.782 --> 01:23:09.773
Why do we have to conform
to what you want?

01:23:09.851 --> 01:23:13.082
Your curriculum is a joke,
and you, sir, are a criminal.

01:23:13.154 --> 01:23:14.416
You know what?
You're a criminal.

01:23:14.489 --> 01:23:16.821
'Cause you rob these kids of
their creativity and their passion.

01:23:16.891 --> 01:23:18.756
That's the real crime!

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:20.419
Yeah.
Maybe he's right.

01:23:23.298 --> 01:23:24.356
Well, what about you parents?

01:23:24.432 --> 01:23:26.627
Did... Did the system
really work out for you?

01:23:26.701 --> 01:23:28.293
Did it teach you
to follow your heart...

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:30.634
...or to just play it safe,
roll over?

01:23:30.705 --> 01:23:32.195
What about you guys?

01:23:32.273 --> 01:23:34.104
Did you always want to be
school administrators?

01:23:34.175 --> 01:23:35.608
Dr. Alexander,
was that your dream?

01:23:35.677 --> 01:23:38.077
Or maybe no,
maybe you wanted to be a poet.

01:23:38.613 --> 01:23:40.638
Maybe you wanted to be
a magician or an artist.

01:23:40.715 --> 01:23:42.842
Maybe you just wanted
to travel the world.

01:23:42.917 --> 01:23:45.147
Look, I... I... I... I lied to you.

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:46.753
I lied to all of you,
and I'm sorry.

01:23:46.821 --> 01:23:48.311
Dad, especially to you.

01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:51.848
But out of that desperation,
something happened that was so amazing.

01:23:51.926 --> 01:23:53.223
Life was full
of possibilities.

01:23:53.294 --> 01:23:55.455
A- A-And isn't that what you
ultimately want for us?

01:23:55.530 --> 01:23:58.761
As parents, I mean, is...
is that, is possibilities.

01:24:01.369 --> 01:24:03.166
Well, we came here today
to ask for your approval...

01:24:03.238 --> 01:24:05.331
...and something
just occurred to me.

01:24:05.407 --> 01:24:07.204
I don't give a shit!

01:24:07.609 --> 01:24:09.042
Who cares about your approval?

01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:11.908
We don't need your approval to
tell us that what we did was real.

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:13.641
'Cause there are so few truths
in this world...

01:24:13.715 --> 01:24:15.342
...that when you see one,
you know it.

01:24:15.417 --> 01:24:17.112
And I know that it is a truth...

01:24:17.185 --> 01:24:19.016
...that real learning
took place at South Harmon.

01:24:19.087 --> 01:24:20.816
Whether you like it or not,
it did.

01:24:20.889 --> 01:24:23.153
'Cause you don't need teachers
or classrooms...

01:24:23.224 --> 01:24:25.715
...or... Or fancy highbrow traditions
or money to really learn.

01:24:25.794 --> 01:24:27.921
You just need people with a
desire to better themselves...

01:24:27.996 --> 01:24:30.829
...and we got that
by the shitload at South Harmon.

01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:33.299
So you can go ahead,
sign your forms...

01:24:33.368 --> 01:24:36.030
...reject us and shoot us down,
and do whatever you gotta do.

01:24:36.104 --> 01:24:37.833
It doesn't really matter
at this point.

01:24:37.906 --> 01:24:39.203
Because we'll never
stop learning...

01:24:39.274 --> 01:24:40.536
...and we'll never stop growing...

01:24:40.608 --> 01:24:42.872
...and we'll never forget the
ideals that were instilled in us...

01:24:42.944 --> 01:24:44.172
...at our place.

01:24:44.245 --> 01:24:45.712
'Cause we are
S.H.I.T. Heads now...

01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:47.304
...and we'll be
S.H.I.T. Heads forever...

01:24:47.382 --> 01:24:49.441
...and nothing you can say
or do or stamp...

01:24:49.517 --> 01:24:51.417
...can take that away from us!
So go!

01:24:57.759 --> 01:24:59.090
Go ahead!

01:25:04.032 --> 01:25:05.226
Everyone...

01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:07.131
...please, quiet down.

01:25:07.569 --> 01:25:09.332
Everyone, please
quiet down.

01:25:09.671 --> 01:25:11.298
Quiet down. Please.

01:25:13.274 --> 01:25:14.605
Thank you.

01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:30.389
Mr. Gaines...

01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:34.254
...your presentation
was unorthodox...

01:25:34.462 --> 01:25:35.759
...to say the least...

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:37.457
...and your methodology is...

01:25:37.532 --> 01:25:39.329
questionable at best.

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:40.492
However...

01:25:40.568 --> 01:25:44.595
...the true purpose of education
is to stimulate the creativity...

01:25:44.672 --> 01:25:47.004
...and the passions
of the student body.

01:25:47.075 --> 01:25:49.976
And in that regard
you have certainly succeeded.

01:25:51.212 --> 01:25:54.704
This board does not
reject innovation...

01:25:54.782 --> 01:25:56.909
...but it must be
watched carefully.

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:58.316
Therefore...

01:25:58.987 --> 01:26:01.114
...the South Harmon
Institute of Technology...

01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:04.352
...will be granted a one-year
probationary period...

01:26:04.425 --> 01:26:07.861
...in which to continue
its experimental programs.

01:26:09.164 --> 01:26:12.361
Don't be so quick to judge
us by the way we look.

01:26:13.101 --> 01:26:14.398
Congratulations.

01:26:29.551 --> 01:26:30.950
Mr. Gaines?

01:26:31.886 --> 01:26:33.012
Trombone.

01:26:33.087 --> 01:26:34.179
What?

01:26:34.255 --> 01:26:36.382
I wanted to play
jazz trombone.

01:26:37.692 --> 01:26:39.660
It's never too late, sir.

01:26:39.727 --> 01:26:41.092
Thank you.

01:26:50.405 --> 01:26:51.565
Hey.
Hey.

01:26:51.639 --> 01:26:53.163
What are you doing here?

01:26:53.241 --> 01:26:55.709
I don't know. There were just
a lot of things in my life...

01:26:55.777 --> 01:26:58.507
...that I thought were real
that ended up being fake.

01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:01.208
So, why can't the opposite
be true?

01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:19.633
This is not your orientation.
This is your disorientation.

01:27:19.701 --> 01:27:22.329
You have been orientated
for years.

01:27:22.403 --> 01:27:24.530
Don't come up to me, go
"Where am I gonna get that?"

01:27:24.606 --> 01:27:27.268
I'm not interested!
You figure it out.

01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:29.336
I only wanted big things for you, Bartleby.

01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:30.843
I'd say this is pretty big.

01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:32.539
Thanks, Dad.
Ah!

01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:34.439
Thanks, Pop.

01:27:34.515 --> 01:27:36.483
Okay, honey, I want you
to have a good semester.

01:27:36.551 --> 01:27:38.917
Okay, I will. I love you.
Lizzie, up top.

01:27:40.755 --> 01:27:42.279
Wasn't enthusiastic,
but I'll take it.

01:27:42.357 --> 01:27:43.949
And I appreciate the smile.

01:27:44.025 --> 01:27:46.391
Schrads! Hey, no time for
chit-chat, my friend.

01:27:46.461 --> 01:27:49.157
I'm teaching "Skepticism 401."
Sha-mon!

01:27:49.297 --> 01:27:51.356
At South Harmon,
we like to begin each semester...

01:27:51.432 --> 01:27:54.799
...by clearing our minds
and doing some deep breathing.

01:27:55.703 --> 01:27:59.434
I got 85 pork tenderloins with
balsamic vinegar demiglaze. Ka-blam!

01:27:59.674 --> 01:28:02.108
Eddie, we gotta pack these
paninis for Rory's nature walk.

01:28:02.176 --> 01:28:03.370
Pronto!

01:28:03.745 --> 01:28:06.236
And someone get a rabbi down
here to bless this chicken.

01:28:06.314 --> 01:28:08.407
Tomorrow we're gonna
go kosher.

01:28:09.017 --> 01:28:11.110
South Harmon actually
allowed me the opportunity...

01:28:11.185 --> 01:28:12.743
...to rediscover my passion
for the arts.

01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:15.186
So I urge you guys to do the
same. Let it come from the heart.

01:28:15.256 --> 01:28:18.020
Let it come from inside. And...
And let the art speak for itself.

01:28:18.092 --> 01:28:19.616
You agree?
Watch... Watch the tip.

01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:21.091
Excuse me.

01:28:21.162 --> 01:28:22.322
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:28:22.397 --> 01:28:25.093
If you're gonna take my picture,
you gotta take it from my good side.

01:28:25.166 --> 01:28:26.997
Um, so there wouldn't
happen to be anybody around...

01:28:27.068 --> 01:28:29.332
...that could show me to my
new dorm room, would there?

01:28:29.404 --> 01:28:32.396
As fate would have it, I recall
your room being right next to mine.

01:28:32.507 --> 01:28:34.031
Really? They're not adjoining
though, right?

01:28:34.108 --> 01:28:36.133
Oh, no, no, no. That would
be totally unacceptable.

01:28:37.111 --> 01:28:39.511
And do me a favor.
Enjoy your time here.

01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:42.276
You got four years, these are
the best years of your life.

01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:44.113
And then, you're.

01:29:04.605 --> 01:29:06.038
I told you.
