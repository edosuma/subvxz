00:01.550 --> 00:02.866
Previously on Castle...

00:02.985 --> 00:04.291
Who killed my mother?

00:04.292 --> 00:05.265
You know I can't give you a name.

00:05.266 --> 00:06.717
You'll run straight at him.

00:06.718 --> 00:08.118
I might as well just shoot you
where you're staying.

00:08.119 --> 00:09.199
They're coming to kill you

00:09.200 --> 00:11.240
and I'm not gonna let them.
I'm gonna end this.

00:11.360 --> 00:13.643
When Montgomery went into that hangar

00:13.644 --> 00:16.344
he sent a package to someone
he trusted.

00:16.346 --> 00:17.898
It contained information damaging

00:18.018 --> 00:21.585
to the person behind all this.
If they let you alone, the package

00:21.586 --> 00:24.193
and the information inside would never
see the light of day.

00:24.194 --> 00:25.490
How do you know this?

00:25.491 --> 00:28.984
In order for it to work, someone had
to make sure you weren't pursuing it.

00:28.985 --> 00:30.690
How the hell could you do this?

00:30.691 --> 00:31.599
Because I love you.

00:31.600 --> 00:33.429
You couldn't deal for my life

00:33.430 --> 00:35.337
like I was some kind of a child.

00:35.457 --> 00:37.109
They went after Montgomery's files.

00:37.110 --> 00:38.893
Did they break in into Montogmery's place?

00:38.894 --> 00:41.129
- He grabbed Montgomery's wedding album.
- Why?

00:41.130 --> 00:42.534
They're looking for someone that he knew.

00:42.535 --> 00:44.427
You keep going with this,

00:44.428 --> 00:45.972
they're gonna come for you, Kate.

00:45.973 --> 00:47.485
Let them come.

00:49.802 --> 00:50.628
Help!

00:50.629 --> 00:52.172
You have no idea what you're up against.

00:52.173 --> 00:53.549
Castle!

00:53.788 --> 00:54.527
Beckett!

00:54.528 --> 00:56.308
I'm putting you both
on administrative leave,

00:56.309 --> 00:57.773
effective immediately.

00:57.936 --> 00:59.008
Keep it.

00:59.313 --> 01:00.514
I resign.

01:01.882 --> 01:02.961
Beckett, what do you want?

01:02.962 --> 01:04.202
You.

01:04.763 --> 01:06.800
You're a very hard man to find.

01:06.801 --> 01:09.104
You're going to tell me where
all that information is,

01:09.105 --> 01:10.217
and after you do,

01:10.218 --> 01:13.076
I'm gonna put Kate Beckett in
the ground once and for all.

01:30.416 --> 01:31.479
Made you a coffee.

01:32.409 --> 01:33.993
So it wasn't a dream.

01:34.188 --> 01:35.044
No.

01:35.055 --> 01:37.576
You definitely... weren't dreaming.

01:39.828 --> 01:40.996
Uh, you were right.

01:41.748 --> 01:43.053
I had no idea.

01:43.434 --> 01:43.981
So you liked it?

01:43.982 --> 01:45.727
Yeah. Even the part where I--

01:45.728 --> 01:47.514
Especially that part. I loved that.

01:47.515 --> 01:49.115
Good. Me too.

01:52.187 --> 01:53.299
So...

01:53.564 --> 01:55.800
You're on-- on board with this, right?

01:55.801 --> 01:56.906
It's not some

01:57.031 --> 01:59.472
"Oh, I-I quit my job, I almost died,

01:59.473 --> 02:00.865
I'm in crisis" thing?

02:02.414 --> 02:03.670
Uh, no. Not for me.

02:03.671 --> 02:04.945
Okay. Me neither.

02:06.551 --> 02:07.511
Okay.

02:07.740 --> 02:08.723
Good.

02:09.812 --> 02:10.812
Good.

02:12.485 --> 02:13.581
But I, uh...

02:14.943 --> 02:16.335
I did just quit my job.

02:17.146 --> 02:19.554
And I do have the day off.

02:21.188 --> 02:23.996
I-I do... too.

02:24.529 --> 02:25.784
Oh, really?

02:25.785 --> 02:26.780
- Yes.
- Huh.

02:27.574 --> 02:28.838
So what would you, um...

02:30.437 --> 02:31.596
Like to do today?

02:32.708 --> 02:34.224
Um, I don't know. We could read.

02:34.225 --> 02:35.301
We could watch TV.

02:35.302 --> 02:37.102
Yeah. We could get something to eat.

02:37.842 --> 02:39.354
We could do that, yeah.

02:40.664 --> 02:42.431
Richard, I'm home!

02:42.432 --> 02:43.516
- Oh, my God.
- Aah!

02:45.944 --> 02:46.944
Oh, God.

02:46.995 --> 02:47.948
You said she was at the Hamptons.

02:47.949 --> 02:49.372
She was in the Hamptons.

02:49.373 --> 02:50.361
She's not supposed to be here.

02:50.362 --> 02:52.559
Darling, we need to talk.

02:52.560 --> 02:53.577
Hide.

02:53.648 --> 02:55.068
- What?
- Hide.

02:55.069 --> 02:56.219
- Are you serious?
- Get in the closet.

02:56.220 --> 02:57.332
No, I'm not going in the closet.

02:57.333 --> 02:58.481
- Get in the closet!
- Oh!

03:00.270 --> 03:01.105
What's going on?

03:01.106 --> 03:02.193
I'm just...

03:02.541 --> 03:03.894
making the bed.

03:03.956 --> 03:05.359
Oh. What are you doing here?

03:05.360 --> 03:07.845
Well, I wanted to talk to you about

03:07.846 --> 03:09.935
your daughter's many fine qualities...

03:09.936 --> 03:10.940
Do we have to do this now?

03:10.941 --> 03:12.567
And to remind you

03:12.568 --> 03:14.920
that our Alexis is a paragon of--

03:14.921 --> 03:17.136
of grace and good sense and maturity,

03:17.137 --> 03:19.954
although where she got those
qualities, I do not know.

03:20.240 --> 03:21.161
Right.

03:21.393 --> 03:22.942
I would just be so much more comfortable

03:22.943 --> 03:25.022
having this conversation
with my clothes on.

03:25.058 --> 03:27.113
Oh. Well, yes.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.708
We'll meet you in the kitchen.

03:29.155 --> 03:31.250
"We"? Alexis is here, too?

03:35.798 --> 03:37.485
How about some tea?

03:37.486 --> 03:39.063
Tea can be very soothing.

03:39.064 --> 03:39.947
Hmm? Oh, no. No tea.

03:39.948 --> 03:41.014
No tea. No tea.

03:41.015 --> 03:42.683
All right. Alexis, are you hungover?

03:43.594 --> 03:46.756
Well, the graduation festivities
got a tad out of hand,

03:46.757 --> 03:48.091
and Alexis called me from the party.

03:48.092 --> 03:49.538
I drove into town, I picked her up.

03:49.539 --> 03:50.772
So please don't get angry, darling.

03:50.773 --> 03:52.178
Well, why didn't you call me?

03:52.280 --> 03:54.144
I tried. You didn't pick up.

03:56.095 --> 03:57.111
Right.

03:57.720 --> 03:59.764
And... that's on me.

03:59.765 --> 04:00.933
That's my bad.

04:01.436 --> 04:05.906
Well, Alexis, as your father,
I have to say, that I am...

04:07.304 --> 04:10.065
deeply disappointed in
you, and yet, oddly proud.

04:10.506 --> 04:12.081
Mm-hmm. Oh, my head is pounding.

04:12.254 --> 04:14.214
Oh, honey, I'll get you
a couple of aspirin.

04:14.215 --> 04:15.359
Oh, no! Aah.

04:16.596 --> 04:17.344
Ooh. No aspirin.

04:17.345 --> 04:18.164
What do you mean? Why not?

04:18.165 --> 04:20.149
It's her first hangover.

04:20.149 --> 04:22.792
I mean, this is a milestone.
It's a rite of passage.

04:22.793 --> 04:25.388
Don't you want to experience this in its--

04:25.566 --> 04:28.645
in its fullness, un--
untrammeled by the--the relief

04:28.646 --> 04:30.870
of over-the counter pain relievers?

04:31.821 --> 04:32.765
No.

04:32.949 --> 04:35.277
No. Okay. Aspirin it is, sweetheart.
I'm sorry.

04:39.046 --> 04:41.702
So...any progress on Beckett's shooter?

04:41.703 --> 04:42.916
We searched his rental car.

04:42.917 --> 04:44.500
We still have no idea where he was going

04:44.501 --> 04:45.949
or even what his real name was.

04:45.950 --> 04:49.238
But we did find out what he stole
from captain Montgomery's house.

04:49.381 --> 04:51.005
The Montgomery's' wedding album?

04:51.125 --> 04:52.441
Why did Maddox want this?

04:52.442 --> 04:55.120
I'm guessing he wanted
this missing photograph.

04:55.135 --> 04:57.473
It's possible he was
after whoever was in it.

04:57.474 --> 04:58.918
Have you been able to track it down?

04:58.919 --> 05:01.285
Well, I've got Evelyn Montgomery
bringing the negatives in.

05:01.286 --> 05:03.622
But truth is, I'm a one-man band here.

05:03.623 --> 05:05.208
I could use a few more investigators.

05:05.209 --> 05:07.169
Well, you can take it up
with the vice president.

05:07.332 --> 05:10.116
I've already lost half my people
to his security detail...

05:10.117 --> 05:12.047
And about to lose the
rest to traffic control.

05:12.048 --> 05:14.767
So for right now, you're on your own.

05:16.000 --> 05:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:23.857 --> 05:26.860
You're putting yourself through
this for nothing, Mr. Smith.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.338
We both know how it will end.

05:29.732 --> 05:32.129
Don't make me take this to the next level.

05:32.899 --> 05:34.859
Tell me where the file is.

05:36.776 --> 05:37.744
Go to hell.

05:52.058 --> 05:54.395
So you here to apologize for
hiding me in your closet?

05:54.423 --> 05:55.760
Look, let me explain.

05:55.761 --> 05:57.345
When I heard her voice,

05:57.760 --> 05:59.193
I reacted by instinct.

05:59.194 --> 06:02.026
Yeah, like the instinct of a
sophomore in high school.

06:02.027 --> 06:02.979
Right.

06:03.630 --> 06:04.790
No. Look, I--

06:04.791 --> 06:05.446
Wait a minute.

06:05.447 --> 06:07.300
You're embarrassed about
being seen with me.

06:07.301 --> 06:08.953
Now that is not true.

06:08.954 --> 06:10.484
Look, I--this--I--

06:10.485 --> 06:14.180
Okay...
This is all just still very new to me,

06:14.181 --> 06:15.431
and call me selfish,

06:15.432 --> 06:18.424
but I want to keep what we have together

06:19.085 --> 06:20.958
to ourselves a bit longer.

06:23.743 --> 06:25.575
Still, it wasn't your finest hour.

06:25.580 --> 06:26.508
No.

06:27.229 --> 06:28.349
But maybe I could...

06:29.870 --> 06:32.046
make it up to you... somehow.

06:34.044 --> 06:36.166
I suppose since we know that your
mom's not gonna be barging in,

06:36.167 --> 06:38.211
we could go for round two.

06:38.218 --> 06:40.194
Well, technically, it would
be round four, but--

06:42.000 --> 06:43.320
She's stalking us. She knows.

06:43.321 --> 06:44.188
Who is it?

06:44.189 --> 06:45.685
Beckett, it's Ryan.

06:47.440 --> 06:48.221
Hide.

06:48.222 --> 06:49.329
Quick. In the closet over there.

06:49.330 --> 06:50.475
Yeah, I'm not getting in there.

06:50.476 --> 06:53.013
Why? I hid in your closet.
Why can't you hide in mine?

06:53.014 --> 06:54.097
Why should I?
Because--

06:54.098 --> 06:56.138
- Beckett, is everything okay?
- Fine.

06:56.156 --> 06:58.650
Okay, maybe I'm not ready
for anyone to know yet...

06:59.097 --> 06:59.985
right now.

06:59.990 --> 07:00.926
Come on. How's he gonna know?

07:00.927 --> 07:02.633
You're here, just like I was there.

07:02.634 --> 07:04.301
Yes, yes, the difference being,

07:04.302 --> 07:05.752
I have my pants on.

07:06.343 --> 07:09.716
Or... or are you embarrassed
to be seen with me?

07:10.738 --> 07:12.522
Okay. Fine.

07:13.308 --> 07:14.532
Just act normal...

07:14.717 --> 07:16.597
If that's even possible for you.

07:17.429 --> 07:18.341
It's me.

07:29.905 --> 07:30.913
Hey, Castle.

07:31.031 --> 07:32.065
What are you doing here?

07:32.066 --> 07:33.735
Well, I was just walking by

07:33.736 --> 07:35.576
the neighbor... hood.

07:35.901 --> 07:37.247
I only live 20...

07:38.153 --> 07:39.400
Uh, what are you doing here?

07:39.401 --> 07:40.905
I need to talk to you about the case.

07:43.293 --> 07:44.294
Uh, Ryan.

07:44.913 --> 07:46.593
Uh, no, Ryan.

07:46.888 --> 07:48.977
I've resigned. I'm done.

07:48.978 --> 07:49.881
Look...

07:50.169 --> 07:52.037
I hope this isn't because of Gates

07:52.258 --> 07:54.512
or... because of what I did.

07:54.513 --> 07:57.277
No. No, look, I get it.

07:57.278 --> 07:58.902
You were just trying to keep us safe.

07:58.903 --> 08:00.063
I still am.

08:00.148 --> 08:01.900
And this guy that threw you off the roof,

08:02.307 --> 08:03.604
he's still out there.

08:03.904 --> 08:04.896
Hey...

08:06.101 --> 08:06.697
Ryan--

08:06.698 --> 08:09.448
I know what this case has done to you.

08:10.299 --> 08:12.203
I'm not asking you to jump back in.

08:13.221 --> 08:14.627
I just want to show you something.

08:14.628 --> 08:15.564
That's all.

08:18.420 --> 08:21.343
We found a copy of the photo Maddox
took from the wedding album.

08:21.616 --> 08:24.155
You're familiar with the guys that
Roy ran with back in the day.

08:24.156 --> 08:24.919
Is he one of them?

08:24.920 --> 08:26.320
I've never seen him before.

08:27.743 --> 08:28.783
I have.

08:30.376 --> 08:31.790
This is the man I told you about,

08:31.791 --> 08:33.679
the one who's been keeping you safe.

08:35.566 --> 08:36.477
Are you sure?

08:36.479 --> 08:38.527
He's older now, but it's definitely him.

08:38.528 --> 08:39.851
What--what are we talking about here?

08:39.852 --> 08:42.419
Whatever information
Montgomery gave to him,

08:42.613 --> 08:44.429
he's been using it to protect you.

08:44.742 --> 08:46.214
But now they've sent...

08:46.696 --> 08:48.797
Maddox to hunt him down and get it back.

08:50.757 --> 08:52.447
If we don't get to him before Maddox does,

08:52.448 --> 08:54.056
you'll never be safe again.

09:09.077 --> 09:10.663
This guy who Maddox is looking for,

09:10.664 --> 09:11.662
he's the key.

09:11.663 --> 09:13.711
We find him, we find Montgomery's file.

09:13.752 --> 09:15.364
Which could lead to who's
behind this whole thing,

09:15.365 --> 09:17.317
including your mother's murder.

09:17.948 --> 09:18.964
And all the times you talked,

09:18.965 --> 09:21.225
he never gave you a name, even a fake one?

09:21.623 --> 09:22.681
No. Or where he worked?

09:22.682 --> 09:23.262
No. Where he lived?

09:23.263 --> 09:24.364
No, nothing like that.

09:25.702 --> 09:26.898
He, um, he called my cell phone.

09:27.125 --> 09:28.256
Uh, two nights ago. Uh, uh...

09:28.655 --> 09:30.048
But from a blocked number.

09:30.066 --> 09:30.956
I'll run your phone records,

09:30.957 --> 09:32.794
see if I can trace the
number that he called from.

09:48.987 --> 09:50.707
This was supposed to be over.

09:51.677 --> 09:53.837
I can't go back again. Not now.

09:56.980 --> 09:58.276
Well, now we don't have a choice.

09:58.277 --> 09:59.861
If Maddox gets to him before we do--

09:59.862 --> 10:01.486
But I don't know how to do this.

10:02.179 --> 10:03.811
I'm not even a cop anymore.

10:04.985 --> 10:06.985
I'll tell you exactly what we do.

10:07.448 --> 10:09.073
We figure out who this is.

10:09.238 --> 10:11.753
We've done it before,
and with less to go on.

10:12.270 --> 10:14.748
And when we do, we lay all of this to rest,

10:14.749 --> 10:16.508
and we go back to where we were.

10:17.805 --> 10:19.076
This is what you're great at.

10:19.752 --> 10:21.272
And I'm not so bad myself.

10:22.331 --> 10:23.331
So...

10:24.500 --> 10:25.233
What do we know?

10:25.234 --> 10:28.481
We know this guy is about 60,
he's a long-time New Yorker,

10:29.044 --> 10:29.883
uh, friends with Montgomery,

10:29.884 --> 10:32.097
so he may have connections
to law enforcement.

10:35.549 --> 10:36.748
He, um...

10:38.525 --> 10:39.965
He seems prominent,

10:40.651 --> 10:41.755
wealthy.

10:42.833 --> 10:44.017
That's right.

10:45.213 --> 10:46.542
And he has been that way

10:46.543 --> 10:48.325
ever since this photo was taken.

10:49.134 --> 10:50.030
How do you know that?

10:50.031 --> 10:51.207
Look at his wrist.

10:51.913 --> 10:53.722
That's a Nautilus 3800.

10:53.732 --> 10:56.373
It was 10 grand when it came out in 1981.

10:56.374 --> 10:57.558
And...

10:58.233 --> 11:00.849
That's the year Montgomery was married--
May of 1981.

11:02.433 --> 11:03.726
How many of these watches

11:03.727 --> 11:06.415
could possibly have been
sold in five months?

11:34.886 --> 11:36.454
Javi, I can't do what you're asking.

11:37.511 --> 11:38.973
I took a bullet for you, Cass.

11:39.043 --> 11:39.926
You forget that?

11:39.927 --> 11:41.846
I can't tap into the D.O.D. database

11:41.847 --> 11:43.255
without authorization.

11:44.195 --> 11:45.588
I'll lose everything, man.

11:48.312 --> 11:49.768
Only if you get caught.

11:51.462 --> 11:52.566
And you won't.

11:54.426 --> 11:56.687
I bought this from a liquidator, cash.

11:56.761 --> 11:59.134
Soon as we're done, I'll wipe the drive,

11:59.135 --> 12:01.319
ditch the box.
It'll never come back to you.

12:01.944 --> 12:03.015
He's former army.

12:03.150 --> 12:04.798
Special Forces, Delta-- I don't know.

12:08.362 --> 12:10.844
This guy shot a friend of mine,
almost killed her.

12:11.139 --> 12:13.539
He's gonna keep coming unless he's stopped.

12:13.984 --> 12:15.528
I need to I.D. him.

12:16.351 --> 12:17.518
You need to help me.

12:20.249 --> 12:22.570
- Okay. Yes.
- Thank you.

12:22.693 --> 12:26.373
All right, the watch company
says that 17 of the 3800s...

12:26.374 --> 12:28.228
were sold in New York in 1981

12:28.389 --> 12:29.988
between January and may.

12:29.989 --> 12:31.900
And did they give you names
of any of these clients?

12:31.901 --> 12:34.628
No, but 9 of the 17 watches

12:34.629 --> 12:36.669
were given as gifts to a legal team

12:36.718 --> 12:38.495
at the law firm of P.P.C.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.613
after they won a civil
suit against Big Tobacco.

12:40.614 --> 12:43.575
Winning a tobacco lawsuit
would get a lot of publicity.

12:43.576 --> 12:44.497
With any luck, we'll I.D.

12:44.498 --> 12:46.608
this guy before Ryan even traces that call.

12:47.109 --> 12:48.178
What do you mean you can't trace the call?

12:48.179 --> 12:49.284
Why the hell not?

12:50.638 --> 12:52.059
Look, I'm on the clock here.

12:52.060 --> 12:53.859
I need to know who made that call. Now.

12:54.674 --> 12:56.837
But--yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just put Officer Hoben on.

12:56.838 --> 12:58.359
He's the guy I usually
deal with over there.

13:03.555 --> 13:05.367
Okay, so this is the P.P.C. legal team

13:05.368 --> 13:08.843
that won the suit, but I...don't see him.

13:08.844 --> 13:10.324
It was a 9-man team.

13:10.477 --> 13:12.947
There's only eight here. He
must be the missing lawyer.

13:12.948 --> 13:14.715
Or he's not a lawyer at all.

13:14.716 --> 13:17.754
Or he is a lawyer, but he operates...

13:18.401 --> 13:19.285
behind the scenes.

13:19.286 --> 13:20.466
He would be, um,

13:21.065 --> 13:23.251
"of counsel," like Michael Clayton.

13:23.252 --> 13:26.010
Castle, this photo is 30 years old.

13:26.011 --> 13:29.043
We have no idea if this guy
still works at that law firm

13:29.044 --> 13:30.979
or if he ever worked there at all.

13:31.513 --> 13:32.970
Beckett. Bad news.

13:32.971 --> 13:35.713
The number the guy called Castle
from came from a burner phone,

13:35.756 --> 13:37.047
and it's out of service.

13:37.048 --> 13:39.617
Whoever this guy is, he covered his tracks.

13:39.717 --> 13:41.854
Look, we put out alerts for Maddox.

13:41.855 --> 13:43.731
We circulated his photo all over the state.

13:43.732 --> 13:45.383
Someone will spot him.

13:45.384 --> 13:46.974
Well, we can't wait for that.

13:47.031 --> 13:48.255
Did you get anything?

13:48.887 --> 13:51.564
Well, there is one thing,
but it's a long shot.

13:51.565 --> 13:53.106
The guy used voice-over-Internet

13:53.107 --> 13:55.007
instead of normal cell service,

13:55.008 --> 13:57.616
but he made a call in a bad signal area

13:57.617 --> 13:59.517
that got routed through a wireless network.

13:59.518 --> 14:01.582
Well, if it's a network,
it'll have an I.P. address.

14:01.665 --> 14:03.865
Yeah, and we traced it.

14:04.895 --> 14:06.216
Um, uh, it's not even in New York.

14:06.217 --> 14:08.313
- Then where is it?
- The call

14:08.618 --> 14:11.294
went through a wireless
network that's registered

14:11.295 --> 14:13.487
to the Magellan Yacht Club
in Westport, Connecticut.

14:13.741 --> 14:15.005
Thanks, Ryan.

14:17.161 --> 14:18.449
He must be a member of this club.

14:18.450 --> 14:21.465
Maybe there's a picture of him
somewhere posted on the site?

14:27.209 --> 14:28.105
Castle.

14:28.527 --> 14:29.415
Look.

14:29.905 --> 14:31.701
On the "of counsel" attorney list.

14:32.481 --> 14:33.860
Now look at the board of directors.

14:33.861 --> 14:36.285
Michael Smith. That's him.

14:44.736 --> 14:46.112
Looks like Maddox found him first.

14:53.945 --> 14:55.026
The file.

14:55.956 --> 14:56.916
Castle.

14:58.752 --> 14:59.831
He's still alive.

15:07.013 --> 15:08.372
Sir, I'm asking you to step away.

15:10.081 --> 15:11.022
The file...

15:12.303 --> 15:13.425
She's not safe.

15:15.038 --> 15:16.068
86...

15:16.563 --> 15:17.820
- 86? What does that mean?
- 86...

15:17.821 --> 15:18.951
I don't know what that means.
86 M--

15:18.952 --> 15:20.579
- Sir, we need to get him to the E.R.
- I don't understand. Wait.

15:20.580 --> 15:22.466
- No, we have to get him to the E.R.
- What does that mean?

15:22.467 --> 15:23.471
Watch your back.

15:26.369 --> 15:27.030
If Smith makes it,

15:27.031 --> 15:29.134
Ryan's gonna put him under police guard,

15:29.403 --> 15:30.731
make sure that Maddox doesn't come back

15:30.732 --> 15:31.922
and finish off the job.

15:32.244 --> 15:34.578
Smith just gave me a message. He said "86."

15:34.808 --> 15:36.459
It has to be a clue to where the file is.

15:36.460 --> 15:38.301
We know where the file is.
It's right there.

15:38.302 --> 15:39.427
It's burnt to a crisp.

15:39.428 --> 15:41.391
No, Smith is too smart
to only keep one copy

15:41.392 --> 15:42.320
in--in his apartment.

15:42.321 --> 15:43.855
He's too careful for that. He's...

15:45.409 --> 15:46.354
It's a code.

15:46.511 --> 15:47.891
The answer's here somewhere.

16:02.319 --> 16:03.212
We need to go.

16:03.355 --> 16:04.443
Well, the answer's got to be here.

16:04.444 --> 16:05.624
It's somewhere here.

16:05.625 --> 16:07.181
Castle, there's nothing left to find.

16:07.182 --> 16:08.398
86 could mean anything.

16:08.399 --> 16:09.826
You're just grasping at straws.

16:09.827 --> 16:11.681
Yes, I'm grasping at straws,

16:11.682 --> 16:13.199
because if that file is gone,

16:14.079 --> 16:15.133
that means they're coming after you,

16:15.134 --> 16:16.707
and there's absolutely nothing I can do.

16:16.708 --> 16:18.884
So, yes, if there is a straw, I'm--

16:18.961 --> 16:19.936
I'm grasping.

16:21.591 --> 16:23.124
Castle, we're not even supposed to be here.

16:23.125 --> 16:25.287
When uniforms come here,
they're gonna arrest us

16:25.288 --> 16:27.002
for breaking and entering.

16:27.003 --> 16:28.178
We're running out of time.

16:31.128 --> 16:32.757
Smith owns property in Lower Manhattan.

16:32.773 --> 16:35.314
This one--
86 Markwell Street.

16:35.836 --> 16:36.577
That's what Smith said.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.411
He said "86" and then "Ma-ma-ma,"

16:38.412 --> 16:40.006
like something started with "M."

16:40.007 --> 16:42.463
This building, this is where the file is.

16:50.049 --> 16:51.257
All right, so...

16:51.710 --> 16:52.826
The building is ten stories.

16:52.827 --> 16:54.759
How hard can it be to find a file, right?

16:54.760 --> 16:56.018
He would've hid it in a place

16:56.019 --> 16:57.724
that was safe from the demolition crew.

16:57.725 --> 17:00.158
Yes, which suggests that Mr. Smith

17:00.159 --> 17:01.723
not only owns this building,

17:01.724 --> 17:03.444
but he knows it inside and out.

17:04.443 --> 17:05.287
Hey.

17:06.016 --> 17:06.873
Thanks.

17:07.335 --> 17:08.820
For what? We haven't found it yet.

17:08.965 --> 17:11.258
Just I-I-I know I never
would've gotten this far

17:11.259 --> 17:12.392
if it wasn't for you.

17:14.099 --> 17:16.454
Hey, we're gonna get this done, you and me.

17:16.992 --> 17:19.574
And we're gonna start by ruling
out all the interior walls.

17:19.575 --> 17:20.832
Smith wouldn't risk hiding it there

17:20.833 --> 17:22.482
with all the Sheetrock getting torn down.

17:22.483 --> 17:23.836
Ceilings are no good either.

17:23.837 --> 17:24.780
Castle.

17:34.159 --> 17:35.612
Michael Smith. 523.

17:35.613 --> 17:37.192
He didn't just own the building.

17:37.193 --> 17:38.836
He had an office on the fifth floor.

17:41.693 --> 17:43.235
Well, that's some helpful information.

17:43.999 --> 17:45.411
Turn around. Hands behind your back.

17:52.944 --> 17:55.719
You just don't know when to quit, do you?

17:56.645 --> 17:57.822
So you convinced Smith

17:57.823 --> 17:59.337
to tell you where the file was.

17:59.392 --> 18:01.429
He told me it was hidden in a floor safe,

18:01.435 --> 18:03.164
but he didn't tell me exactly where.

18:03.729 --> 18:05.482
Good thing you guys cleared that up.

18:08.210 --> 18:08.872
You didn't kill him

18:08.873 --> 18:10.722
in case you couldn't find the file.

18:11.790 --> 18:15.131
And once I do, I'm finally
gonna settle our account.

18:22.220 --> 18:23.184
See you soon.

18:26.477 --> 18:27.612
Okay, we've got a minute, maybe two

18:27.613 --> 18:28.607
to get the hell out of here.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.078
Castle, how tight are your zip ties?

18:30.079 --> 18:32.068
- Can you move your hands at all?
- No, just barely.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.604
Do you have anything
sharp in your pocket...

18:33.605 --> 18:35.058
- Uh, no.
- Like a knife,

18:35.175 --> 18:37.521
- nail clippers?
- No. Who carries nail clippers?

18:37.522 --> 18:39.616
- Do you have keys?
- No, it's a fob. It's a remote.

18:39.617 --> 18:42.337
- There's--there's--there's
a-a drywall screw. - Perfect.

18:42.338 --> 18:43.661
That's--that's not gonna help.

18:43.662 --> 18:44.827
Ah, I beg to differ.

18:44.828 --> 18:47.642
All I have to do is grab the zip tie

18:47.854 --> 18:51.514
and... saw through.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.697
I am barely making a dent in this thing.

19:14.958 --> 19:16.929
Castle, I hear footsteps. He's coming.

19:19.051 --> 19:19.892
Hurry.

19:19.985 --> 19:22.334
If we got murdered right
now, I'd feel so ripped off.

19:22.335 --> 19:24.039
Yeah, me too.

19:24.594 --> 19:25.472
At least...

19:26.467 --> 19:27.574
At least we had last night.

19:27.751 --> 19:29.396
We should've done that four years ago.

19:32.505 --> 19:33.880
Done what four years ago?

19:36.881 --> 19:39.560
Maddox's real name is Cedric Marks.

19:39.561 --> 19:40.982
Once he finished his tour,

19:40.992 --> 19:43.255
he got a job at a place
called Arantus Solutions,

19:43.256 --> 19:45.361
a kind of black-ops military contractor.

19:45.362 --> 19:46.715
How'd all that lead you here?

19:46.716 --> 19:49.277
Well, once I got his name, I
put a BOLO out on his car.

19:49.278 --> 19:51.317
A uniform spotted it outside this building.

19:51.318 --> 19:53.038
When I came to check on it,
that's when I saw your car.

19:53.039 --> 19:54.077
Wait, wait, Espo.

19:54.274 --> 19:56.483
523 is around the corner.
You got an extra piece?

19:56.484 --> 19:57.528
Yeah.

19:59.650 --> 20:01.103
Nice. What about for me?

20:02.329 --> 20:04.116
Oh, you mean an extra extra piece?

20:46.492 --> 20:47.422
Don't move.

20:48.143 --> 20:49.348
Don't even breathe.

20:51.321 --> 20:53.388
Reach for it, and I'll blow your head off.

20:55.701 --> 20:58.073
Okay, detective. You're in charge.

20:59.198 --> 21:02.673
Now slowly reach down and hand me the file.

21:28.659 --> 21:29.540
He's gone.

21:29.582 --> 21:31.044
Thanks for the warning, Smith.

21:31.322 --> 21:33.415
He knew that Maddox would
show up here first.

21:35.170 --> 21:36.027
What the...

21:38.081 --> 21:39.046
The file.

21:46.456 --> 21:48.570
So let me see if I understand.

21:48.854 --> 21:50.168
As luck would have it, you three

21:50.169 --> 21:52.543
were in the neighborhood taking a walk?

21:52.772 --> 21:55.236
Well, many people consider that
the best form of exercise.

21:55.237 --> 21:56.783
It's low impact, it has--

21:56.784 --> 21:58.335
Then you heard an explosion,

21:58.336 --> 22:00.199
and as concerned private citizens,

22:00.200 --> 22:02.004
you rushed inside to check it out?

22:02.048 --> 22:03.198
Yeah. That's right.

22:05.719 --> 22:07.077
Is that how you remember it?

22:07.191 --> 22:08.039
Yes, sir.

22:08.438 --> 22:09.760
Captain Gates, I can personally
vouch for that--

22:09.761 --> 22:11.104
I am not interested, Mr. Castle,

22:11.105 --> 22:13.109
as you specialize in fiction.

22:13.902 --> 22:16.221
Let's say you happened to be in the area.

22:16.301 --> 22:18.755
How do you explain the fact that Maddox,

22:18.756 --> 22:20.298
the killer we're searching for

22:20.299 --> 22:21.884
and the man who shot you last year,

22:21.885 --> 22:23.304
is the one lying there dead?

22:23.623 --> 22:24.620
Bad karma.

22:26.998 --> 22:28.185
Detective Ryan.

22:30.930 --> 22:32.474
Do you know anything about this?

22:32.707 --> 22:34.446
Just that it appears the safe was rigged

22:34.447 --> 22:35.890
to blow when Maddox opened it.

22:36.499 --> 22:37.719
And what was in that safe?

22:37.790 --> 22:38.682
Hard to say.

22:38.890 --> 22:40.018
Papers of some kind.

22:40.975 --> 22:42.292
And I don't suppose you know

22:42.293 --> 22:45.058
what was in those papers
and why Maddox was here.

22:45.941 --> 22:48.261
Like I said, we were just walking by.

22:51.642 --> 22:53.048
We were so close.

22:53.049 --> 22:55.430
That file would've told us
who's at the center of this

22:55.431 --> 22:56.583
and who killed my mom.

22:56.801 --> 22:58.479
Well, at least Maddox won't
be coming after you.

22:58.480 --> 22:59.925
They'll just send somebody else.

23:00.144 --> 23:01.155
Unless whoever's behind all this

23:01.156 --> 23:02.842
doesn't know the file's been destroyed.

23:03.028 --> 23:04.371
Maybe he thinks it's still in play.

23:04.618 --> 23:05.516
I wouldn't bet on that.

23:05.517 --> 23:06.398
Would you?

23:25.095 --> 23:26.345
You want to put that thing away?

23:26.542 --> 23:27.461
Well, if it isn't Judas.

23:27.462 --> 23:29.070
Yeah, okay, pal. You
want to give it a break?

23:29.071 --> 23:30.307
Guys, come on.

23:32.915 --> 23:33.846
What are you doing here?

23:35.332 --> 23:36.241
I came to bring you this.

23:38.653 --> 23:39.716
Paper from the safe?

23:41.798 --> 23:42.825
Now what are we looking for?

23:42.928 --> 23:45.093
Names, places, dates--

23:45.317 --> 23:46.950
anything that tells us
what was in these files

23:46.951 --> 23:49.312
and why someone is so
desperate to keep it hidden.

24:06.901 --> 24:07.844
Five hours,

24:08.542 --> 24:10.587
and all I got is something
the size of a playing card.

24:10.588 --> 24:11.823
And not only that, it's blank.

24:11.824 --> 24:13.636
Yeah, well, I got "ending balance" here.

24:13.805 --> 24:15.661
I think it's some kind of bank statement.

24:17.308 --> 24:20.566
Not just a bank statement.

24:22.233 --> 24:24.146
This is part of a money
order made out to cash.

24:24.147 --> 24:25.013
That could be a payoff.

24:25.014 --> 24:26.925
And whoever it went to is probably our guy.

24:26.926 --> 24:28.109
Well, that would make sense.

24:28.125 --> 24:28.818
Yeah? In what way?

24:28.819 --> 24:29.673
Well, all of this started

24:29.674 --> 24:31.204
when Montgomery and his cop buddies

24:31.205 --> 24:33.461
started kidnapping
mobsters for ransom money.

24:33.462 --> 24:34.651
And we know that someone found out

24:34.652 --> 24:36.554
and demanded a cut of that money.

24:36.555 --> 24:38.560
And whoever that is, there's
something in this file

24:38.561 --> 24:39.978
he does not want to get out.

24:40.338 --> 24:42.607
Whoa, this-- this has numbers on it.

24:43.405 --> 24:44.354
And it's machine printed.

24:44.355 --> 24:47.111
It's an 8-digit string, so
it's not a phone number.

24:47.354 --> 24:49.355
Wait a minute. Oh, that's the--

24:49.356 --> 24:51.123
This is the back of that money order.

24:51.224 --> 24:52.068
And these digits,

24:52.069 --> 24:53.876
0-8-6-7-2-2-4-1,

24:53.877 --> 24:55.890
that's the account it was deposited in.

24:55.891 --> 24:57.463
If we figure out whose account that is,

24:57.464 --> 24:58.709
that should give us a name.

24:58.710 --> 24:59.676
And I think I know a way.

24:59.677 --> 25:01.254
Uh, do you remember when we were checking

25:01.255 --> 25:03.218
banking accounts for the
dirty bomb investigation?

25:03.219 --> 25:05.174
We used the federal banking database.

25:05.725 --> 25:07.229
And I still remember the password.

25:11.282 --> 25:13.788
I'm not sure they even track
accounts going back this far.

25:14.003 --> 25:16.291
Whoever owns that account

25:16.292 --> 25:18.572
is the person that killed my mom.

25:19.507 --> 25:20.426
Run it.

25:31.267 --> 25:32.893
The account was closed 19 years ago.

25:33.318 --> 25:35.469
It belonged to a guy named
William H. Bracken.

25:41.285 --> 25:43.389
You mean Senator William Bracken?

25:57.926 --> 25:59.909
According to the bio on
his campaign web site,

25:59.910 --> 26:02.042
Senator Bracken was
Assistant District Attorney

26:02.043 --> 26:04.086
for New York from '88 till '92.

26:05.625 --> 26:06.469
Kate?

26:07.437 --> 26:08.474
I'm fine, Castle.

26:09.033 --> 26:10.329
Bracken's timeline fits.

26:10.330 --> 26:12.209
That's when Montgomery was
kidnapping gangsters.

26:12.210 --> 26:13.546
Bracken must have heard
about what they were doing

26:13.547 --> 26:14.423
through the grapevine.

26:14.424 --> 26:17.137
And then he realized that
he couldn't charge mobsters

26:17.138 --> 26:19.523
because they wouldn't testify
and then the cops would walk.

26:19.524 --> 26:21.949
So instead he decided to
get in on the action.

26:21.950 --> 26:23.909
If they were collecting
ransom from mob guys,

26:23.910 --> 26:26.613
he wanted a taste in the
form of cash money orders.

26:26.614 --> 26:28.495
Right, but as his political star rose

26:28.496 --> 26:30.403
from congressman to senator, he realized...

26:30.404 --> 26:31.985
he had to make sure the
scandal never came to light.

26:31.986 --> 26:33.469
So then people started dying.

26:33.470 --> 26:34.735
- This would explain...
- Ryan.

26:34.736 --> 26:36.039
Why he's coming after you right now.

26:36.040 --> 26:38.361
Word is, Bracken's being
groomed to run for president.

26:38.412 --> 26:40.308
He's trying to clean
house, and you're next.

26:40.309 --> 26:41.392
We need to take him down.

26:41.393 --> 26:43.480
How? All we have are a bunch of numbers

26:43.481 --> 26:45.768
that are meaningless to anyone but us.

26:45.769 --> 26:48.613
We have absolutely no hard
evidence against him.

26:48.614 --> 26:51.137
Uh, I may have the next best thing.

26:51.138 --> 26:53.602
I just got word that Michael
Smith is out of surgery,

26:53.845 --> 26:54.838
and he's awake.

26:56.052 --> 26:57.105
Smith is the key.

26:57.431 --> 26:58.846
He can connect all this to Bracken.

26:58.847 --> 27:00.511
Okay, Castle and I are
gonna go talk to him.

27:00.512 --> 27:01.681
You guys see if you can find the link

27:01.682 --> 27:03.193
between Maddox and Bracken.

27:08.773 --> 27:09.567
Ryan call you?

27:09.568 --> 27:10.551
Yeah, yeah.

27:13.635 --> 27:14.669
You're alive.

27:15.560 --> 27:16.595
Join the club.

27:16.907 --> 27:18.296
What about the other file?

27:20.395 --> 27:21.893
Maddox opened the safe.

27:22.710 --> 27:23.853
We put enough of it together

27:23.854 --> 27:25.735
to know that Bracken took dirty money.

27:29.254 --> 27:30.240
Close the door.

27:32.817 --> 27:34.826
The irony is, he used that money to finance

27:34.827 --> 27:36.678
his first congressional campaign.

27:37.065 --> 27:38.362
We need proof of that,

27:38.967 --> 27:40.638
along with anything else that he did.

27:41.088 --> 27:42.285
There is no proof.

27:44.416 --> 27:45.877
Well, there's you. You can testify.

27:45.878 --> 27:47.140
That will never happen.

27:48.279 --> 27:51.526
You see, Roy Montgomery
once did me a favor.

27:51.634 --> 27:54.763
So I kept that file and I protected you

27:54.923 --> 27:56.486
at great personal cost

27:57.062 --> 27:58.536
because I owed Roy.

28:00.185 --> 28:01.423
But I don't owe you.

28:02.998 --> 28:04.897
So you're just gonna let him

28:04.898 --> 28:06.026
g-get away with murder?

28:06.027 --> 28:07.644
You don't understand, detective.

28:08.595 --> 28:10.825
He's protected, untouchable.

28:10.891 --> 28:12.362
You're just gonna end up dead,

28:14.668 --> 28:15.685
and so am I.

28:18.104 --> 28:19.375
Now as it is,

28:19.376 --> 28:21.018
my best bet is to just...

28:23.193 --> 28:24.253
disappear.

28:26.368 --> 28:27.875
I suggest you do the same.

28:29.364 --> 28:31.003
You know that you know too much,

28:31.763 --> 28:33.178
just like Roy and my mom did.

28:33.179 --> 28:35.583
They found you once. They
will find you again.

28:35.584 --> 28:38.210
And your only bet is to work with me.

28:48.232 --> 28:49.285
I'm tired.

28:49.573 --> 28:50.594
You need to go.

29:04.429 --> 29:05.377
Okay. Thank you.

29:05.930 --> 29:07.876
Yeah, you just let me know
if you figure anything out.

29:08.372 --> 29:09.986
All right. That was Ryan.

29:10.329 --> 29:11.020
He said they found

29:11.021 --> 29:13.050
no concrete connection
between Maddox and Bracken.

29:13.051 --> 29:14.450
Yeah, and we won't find one.

29:14.484 --> 29:15.487
He's too careful.

29:15.575 --> 29:16.954
Smith is the connection.

29:16.955 --> 29:18.604
Yeah, but he won't cooperate, Castle.

29:18.605 --> 29:19.992
He's already made that clear.

29:19.993 --> 29:22.500
This is his only play. He's
smart enough to know that.

29:22.501 --> 29:24.504
He just needs a little
bit of encouragement.

29:27.896 --> 29:28.681
Okay.

29:32.453 --> 29:34.639
Hey. Wait. Why aren't you with Smith?

29:34.640 --> 29:36.473
Dispatch called and told me to stand down.

29:47.420 --> 29:49.333
Wait. Wait. What happened?

29:49.543 --> 29:51.908
Looks like a heart attack.
We did everything we could.

29:54.282 --> 29:55.501
Ladies and gentlemen,

29:55.502 --> 29:57.544
I am proud to introduce to you

29:57.949 --> 29:59.415
the Vice President of the United States--

29:59.416 --> 30:01.021
Mr. John Russell.

30:01.196 --> 30:03.204
Thank you, Senator Bracken.

30:11.756 --> 30:14.500
I finally figured out who he is--

30:14.501 --> 30:16.024
the guy that killed my mom--

30:16.025 --> 30:18.030
and there's nothing I can do about it.

30:19.963 --> 30:21.113
Did Ryan talk to you?

30:21.114 --> 30:22.577
Did he check those security cameras

30:22.578 --> 30:23.903
around Smith's room?

30:24.216 --> 30:25.263
Yes.

30:26.663 --> 30:27.829
And?

30:29.060 --> 30:30.856
The cameras were disabled.

30:32.663 --> 30:34.937
Okay. So they're coming for me.

30:34.938 --> 30:37.241
Ryan's got two teams stationed outside.

30:37.242 --> 30:39.027
And what about tomorrow

30:40.154 --> 30:42.158
and the day after that?

30:42.807 --> 30:45.011
Let me take you someplace, Kate,

30:45.629 --> 30:47.137
someplace you'll be safe.

30:56.492 --> 30:59.038
I'll never be safe.

31:46.754 --> 31:48.016
What do you mean, she's not here?

31:48.017 --> 31:50.116
I mean, she's not here and
she's not answering her cell.

31:50.117 --> 31:51.409
I thought you had a detail on her.

31:51.410 --> 31:52.762
I did. I do.

31:52.763 --> 31:54.034
If she would've left this building,

31:54.035 --> 31:54.999
they would've seen her.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.721
Not if she didn't want them to.

31:57.762 --> 31:59.318
Where is Senator Bracken right now?

31:59.438 --> 32:00.934
Oh, man, you don't think that she--
Just...

32:01.445 --> 32:03.433
Yeah, it's detective Kevin Ryan,

32:03.434 --> 32:04.697
badge number 4-2-3-4-4.

32:04.698 --> 32:06.948
Can I get a 20 on Senator Bracken?

32:08.196 --> 32:09.982
He's hosting a fund-raiser
at the Widmark Hotel.

32:09.983 --> 32:11.572
Ask if anyone else has
called to check on him.

32:11.573 --> 32:14.084
Did anyone call to check on him?

32:15.449 --> 32:17.070
Okay. Thanks.

32:17.655 --> 32:19.564
Beckett phoned 'em an hour ago.

32:20.700 --> 32:22.839
She's gonna kill Senator Bracken.

32:49.064 --> 32:50.118
Hey, Hastings.

32:50.119 --> 32:51.290
Hey, Detective Beckett.

32:51.291 --> 32:52.790
They got you on security detail, too?

32:52.791 --> 32:54.284
Yeah. You know, I need
to speak with someone.

32:54.285 --> 32:56.082
You think I could jump this line?

32:59.939 --> 33:01.806
For you? Of course.

33:01.807 --> 33:02.608
Thank you.

33:08.909 --> 33:09.747
Good to see you.

33:09.748 --> 33:11.195
Are you with me on that?

33:11.478 --> 33:13.290
I'm supposed to be kissing babies.

33:21.664 --> 33:23.699
You're wasting your time, detective.

33:24.604 --> 33:27.278
You have no idea what you're up against.

33:28.388 --> 33:30.591
You woke the dragon.

33:30.592 --> 33:34.332
And this is so much
bigger than you realize.

33:34.333 --> 33:36.189
This is my spot, Kate.

33:36.606 --> 33:38.674
This is where I stand.

34:04.914 --> 34:06.437
Are you with me on that?

34:06.599 --> 34:08.107
- Yeah!
- Thank you.

34:18.219 --> 34:20.793
Please excuse me just--just--
just for one minute.

34:20.971 --> 34:22.154
Please. Just...

34:25.603 --> 34:26.969
Hello.

34:28.063 --> 34:31.431
This is Kate Beckett.

34:31.500 --> 34:35.002
I can see you know the name.

34:35.070 --> 34:39.206
That's right. I'm watching.

34:39.274 --> 34:40.674
I don't know what this is about,

34:40.742 --> 34:43.511
but I am not interested in playing games.

34:43.578 --> 34:46.213
Well, you better get interested.

34:46.281 --> 34:49.049
I have information that
will destroy your career

34:49.117 --> 34:52.953
and I will use it unless
you do exactly as I say.

35:00.321 --> 35:01.820
We need to talk to Senator Bracken.

35:01.821 --> 35:03.105
He's in meeting with a donor.

35:03.251 --> 35:04.384
What donor? Where is he?

35:04.385 --> 35:05.832
He didn't say.

35:08.755 --> 35:10.392
Who are you calling?

35:10.554 --> 35:11.348
Gates?

35:11.349 --> 35:12.154
Um...

35:12.971 --> 35:14.735
Put that phone away or I'm
gonna break your friggin' arm.

35:14.736 --> 35:16.940
Javi, we can't let her throw her life away.

35:16.941 --> 35:18.843
- We don't know she's doing that.
- What do you mean?

35:18.844 --> 35:20.327
You're the one who said she
was gonna kill the guy.

35:20.328 --> 35:23.278
Okay, I know. Okay, yes,
that's right, but...

35:24.350 --> 35:26.570
But she hasn't done that yet, right?

35:26.980 --> 35:29.189
Look, you make that call, you're
labeling her an assassin.

35:29.190 --> 35:31.523
That's a bell you can't unring.

35:31.524 --> 35:33.993
So let's not make that call, not yet.

35:40.395 --> 35:41.378
All right.

35:48.568 --> 35:50.252
That's far enough.

35:54.700 --> 35:56.352
What do you want, Ms. Beckett?

35:56.353 --> 35:57.978
The truth.

35:59.258 --> 36:02.043
Never expect that from a politician.

36:02.388 --> 36:04.424
Besides, if you really had information,

36:04.425 --> 36:06.812
wouldn't you already know the truth?

36:07.967 --> 36:10.620
Roy Montgomery, McCallister,

36:10.621 --> 36:12.812
John Raglan, my mother--

36:12.813 --> 36:15.769
everyone that you've ever had killed,

36:15.770 --> 36:17.568
I want you to admit to it.

36:17.569 --> 36:21.366
Your mother's death was a tragedy...

36:21.513 --> 36:25.096
And I am deeply sorry for your loss.

36:26.798 --> 36:29.161
But I can't give you what you want.

36:32.890 --> 36:34.622
When I was 14,

36:35.176 --> 36:38.242
I got to be friends with this
boy in the neighborhood--

36:38.388 --> 36:39.801
Lamar Dokes.

36:39.802 --> 36:41.219
Sweet kid.

36:41.220 --> 36:43.673
I used to help him with his
homework after school.

36:43.819 --> 36:45.974
Well, one day, he doesn't come to school.

36:46.225 --> 36:49.337
So I went by his apartment

36:49.492 --> 36:51.272
and the door was open.

36:52.671 --> 36:54.284
I walked in

36:54.853 --> 36:56.562
and...

36:57.442 --> 37:01.759
I found Lamar lying on
his mattress... dead,

37:01.946 --> 37:03.956
his little sister the same way.

37:03.957 --> 37:06.254
His mother was in the bedroom.

37:06.255 --> 37:08.499
She had hanged herself.

37:08.657 --> 37:10.760
Now she left a note. She'd lost her job.

37:10.761 --> 37:12.668
She was being evicted.

37:12.669 --> 37:13.940
And I thought, how could a woman

37:13.941 --> 37:16.166
be so desperate, so without hope,

37:16.167 --> 37:17.887
that she could crush up pills,

37:17.888 --> 37:19.918
put them in hot chocolate,

37:20.104 --> 37:22.419
and give them to her kids?

37:24.065 --> 37:25.989
And that was the moment...

37:26.543 --> 37:28.139
The moment I knew I wanted to help

37:28.140 --> 37:30.702
make people's lives better.

37:30.703 --> 37:32.143
And I have.

37:32.144 --> 37:35.173
I strengthened the safety net
to protect kids like Lamar.

37:35.174 --> 37:37.140
I created jobs in those neighborhoods.

37:37.141 --> 37:39.457
I've done great things...

37:39.899 --> 37:42.717
Just as you've done great things.

37:51.440 --> 37:54.410
Who do you think you're talking to?

37:57.268 --> 38:02.352
How can you justify yourself to me?

38:04.047 --> 38:06.943
My mother was stabbed in an alley

38:06.944 --> 38:08.693
because of you.

38:08.694 --> 38:11.647
She bled to death alone

38:12.273 --> 38:13.709
in a pile of garbage!

38:13.710 --> 38:16.194
So save me your campaign speeches

38:16.195 --> 38:17.910
about the great things.

38:17.911 --> 38:21.419
You sound a bit delusional, you know?

38:21.572 --> 38:22.737
But then again, who are you?

38:22.738 --> 38:24.131
You're a disgraced cop,

38:24.132 --> 38:26.131
obsessed with her mother's murder.

38:26.132 --> 38:27.451
And who am I?

38:27.452 --> 38:29.961
I'm a decent man looking
out for the little guy.

38:29.962 --> 38:33.584
That's who the public sees.

38:33.585 --> 38:35.920
And every time they elect me,

38:36.129 --> 38:37.607
I'm humbled.

38:37.762 --> 38:39.891
I strive harder to live up to that ideal.

38:39.892 --> 38:42.142
I want to be that man.

38:43.829 --> 38:47.290
And I won't let you or anyone else

38:47.291 --> 38:49.016
get in my way.

38:50.509 --> 38:51.890
I don't think you're in a position

38:51.891 --> 38:54.299
to threaten, senator.

38:54.300 --> 38:56.714
See, here's what you don't understand--

38:57.244 --> 38:59.135
it's not who has the gun,

38:59.362 --> 39:01.677
it's who has the power.

39:02.646 --> 39:05.304
Do you really think that's you?

39:19.859 --> 39:21.950
I have the file.

39:23.728 --> 39:26.154
Smith had another copy.

39:32.376 --> 39:36.183
0-8-6-7-2-2-4-1.

39:36.184 --> 39:37.886
That's the number of the bank account

39:37.887 --> 39:40.565
where you deposited the money orders.

39:41.158 --> 39:42.986
So you're right.

39:43.157 --> 39:46.006
It is about who holds the power.

39:46.360 --> 39:49.704
Now I could release that
file and destroy you,

39:49.705 --> 39:52.552
but what would that mean
for my life expectancy?

39:53.042 --> 39:55.015
So here's how it is--

39:56.468 --> 39:59.127
the deal that you had with Smith,

39:59.639 --> 40:01.907
that's our deal now.

40:02.732 --> 40:05.890
And if anything happens to me

40:05.891 --> 40:08.257
or anyone that I care about,

40:08.258 --> 40:09.472
that file goes public.

40:09.473 --> 40:11.242
Am I clear?

40:15.505 --> 40:17.780
That's a yes-or-no question.

40:19.322 --> 40:21.015
Yes.

40:22.111 --> 40:24.186
And one more thing.

40:25.258 --> 40:28.236
Whoever it is you think I am,

40:28.237 --> 40:31.645
whatever it is you think you know about me,

40:32.478 --> 40:36.188
you have no idea what I'm capable of

40:36.189 --> 40:38.882
or how far I will go.

40:38.999 --> 40:42.964
I am done being afraid.

40:43.119 --> 40:44.899
It's your turn now.

40:45.118 --> 40:46.698
Oh!

40:50.536 --> 40:53.171
That's gonna leave a nasty scar.

40:54.977 --> 40:56.844
Every time you see it,

40:56.845 --> 40:59.089
think of me.

41:12.667 --> 41:14.229
Kate, tell me you didn't...

41:20.192 --> 41:22.210
We reached an understanding.

41:22.211 --> 41:23.640
What about your mom?

41:23.641 --> 41:25.419
I'll get justice for her.

41:25.605 --> 41:27.457
Just not today.

41:27.635 --> 41:29.048
Until then,

41:29.049 --> 41:30.914
I'll get it for others.

41:34.924 --> 41:37.070
Your resignation has been accepted.

41:37.071 --> 41:38.247
The matter is settled.

41:38.248 --> 41:39.493
Sir, I have

41:39.494 --> 41:43.051
the top case-closure rate in the precinct.

41:43.052 --> 41:44.764
And now that the man that shot me is dead,

41:44.765 --> 41:47.012
that particular case will
no longer be an issue.

41:47.013 --> 41:48.045
Really?

41:48.046 --> 41:51.129
Because it seems to be the
gift that keeps on giving.

41:51.348 --> 41:55.035
I'm told we put a Michael Smith
under guard at the hospital.

41:55.036 --> 41:57.027
What was his role in this?

41:58.185 --> 42:00.069
I-I don't know.

42:00.070 --> 42:02.051
I don't believe you.

42:02.644 --> 42:06.484
You're covering for someone,
and I know who it is.

42:08.385 --> 42:10.339
But I don't intend to dig up the past

42:10.340 --> 42:13.366
and tarnish Roy Montgomery's reputation.

42:13.367 --> 42:15.167
The fact is, I...

42:15.329 --> 42:17.395
I admire your loyalty.

42:17.396 --> 42:20.157
I hope you feel that for me someday.

42:21.947 --> 42:24.884
Does that mean I can show
up for duty tomorrow?

42:25.853 --> 42:28.103
No? What does she mean, no?

42:28.104 --> 42:30.191
Well, I have to serve out my suspension,

42:30.192 --> 42:32.055
same as Esposito.

42:32.056 --> 42:33.479
What are you gonna do in the meantime?

42:33.480 --> 42:35.056
Oh, I'm pretty sure I'll
think of something.
