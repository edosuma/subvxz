[clank, man groans]

00:37.950 --> 00:39.691
Hm.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.567
Mmm!

00:45.610 --> 00:46.916
Mm...

00:46.959 --> 00:48.831
[dog barks in distance]

01:15.771 --> 01:18.295
[heavy breathing,
footsteps on video]

01:47.455 --> 01:50.197
[door quietly creaks]

02:15.178 --> 02:17.006
Oh, my God.

02:50.779 --> 02:51.823
Okay, so...

02:51.867 --> 02:53.434
So, Gibbs was there.

02:53.477 --> 02:54.478
Uh-huh.
You were there, too.

02:54.522 --> 02:56.437
But Gibbs was speaking

02:56.480 --> 02:57.960
with an
Israeli accent.
[laughs]

02:58.003 --> 02:59.614
You sounded like
Jimmy Palmer.

02:59.657 --> 03:00.919
I'm not completely
comfortable

03:00.963 --> 03:03.008
with the fact that you
had a dream about me.

03:03.052 --> 03:04.314
Well, it's not like
I can control it.

03:04.358 --> 03:05.881
You're not making me
feel any better.

03:05.924 --> 03:07.578
Get these down
to archives ASAP.

03:07.622 --> 03:09.493
They've been asking for them
for three months.
Okay.

03:09.537 --> 03:11.495
Agent McGee--
probationary agent to be--

03:11.539 --> 03:12.496
good morning.

03:12.540 --> 03:13.889
Looks like Tony.

03:13.932 --> 03:15.586
Doesn't sound like him.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.240
What are you up to, Tony?

03:17.284 --> 03:19.111
Just catching up on
some old paperwork.

03:19.155 --> 03:20.722
I think we're being
set up for something.

03:20.765 --> 03:23.333
Then we should
just ignore him.

03:23.377 --> 03:25.379
Old paperwork, huh?

03:25.422 --> 03:27.294
Boy, that sounds fun.

03:27.337 --> 03:29.687
Hey, maybe you can do
some of my expense reports

03:29.731 --> 03:30.775
for my Canadian trip, huh?

03:30.819 --> 03:32.560
Got in early.
Had some time to kill.

03:32.603 --> 03:34.649
Also, there's
a get-well card

03:34.692 --> 03:36.085
for Director Vance
in there.

03:36.128 --> 03:37.521
You can sign it
when you get the chance.

03:37.565 --> 03:39.784
McGEE: Huh? Last
time you did

03:39.828 --> 03:41.133
an expense report for me,

03:41.177 --> 03:43.266
you reclassified my meals
as livestock feed.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.399
Well, that was
a little childish.

03:45.442 --> 03:46.791
Yeah, I was audited.

03:46.835 --> 03:47.705
Well, I guess that
makes us even.

03:47.749 --> 03:49.141
GIBBS:
Great. Then I don't

03:49.185 --> 03:50.534
need to hear about it,
whatever it is.

03:50.578 --> 03:51.579
Get moving. We got

03:51.622 --> 03:52.971
a missing petty officer.

03:53.015 --> 03:54.886
ZIVA: There were no
hits on the NCIC.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.105
Has he been missing 30 days?

03:56.148 --> 03:57.149
We're not waiting 30 days.

03:58.673 --> 04:01.023
ZIVA:
Petty Officer Jerry Neisler.

04:01.066 --> 04:04.156
Gail Walsh, District
Attorney out of Arlington.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.854
It's only been a day, but
the missing petty officer's

04:05.897 --> 04:07.203
a witness in a capital
murder trial.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.161
GIBBS:
The only witness.Any idea where he is?

04:11.512 --> 04:13.688
Right. That is what
we're going to find out.

04:13.731 --> 04:14.863
He's Navy, so I hoped

04:14.906 --> 04:16.517
NCIS might be able to help.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.040
My department is
stretched thin as it is,

04:18.083 --> 04:19.694
and... I'm almost out of time.

04:19.737 --> 04:21.261
The trial starts
in two days.

04:21.304 --> 04:23.567
My entire case rests on
Jerry's testimony.

04:23.611 --> 04:25.439
Without it,
the killer will walk.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.319
WALSH: This is the
last place I saw Jerry.

04:36.363 --> 04:38.756
I dropped him off here
six days ago and he was

04:38.800 --> 04:40.105
supposed to check
in every day.

04:40.149 --> 04:41.324
ZIVA: He does not
live here?

04:41.368 --> 04:42.847
No. He said he was
going on a hunting trip

04:42.891 --> 04:45.502
with a friend who was about
to deploy to Afghanistan;

04:45.546 --> 04:47.287
that he was going to stay
and water the plants.

04:47.330 --> 04:48.810
Did you check the
petty officer's place?

04:48.853 --> 04:50.333
With a fine-toothed comb.

04:50.377 --> 04:52.335
After a credit card
purchase for gas,

04:52.379 --> 04:53.554
he disappeared without a trace.

04:53.597 --> 04:54.903
We spoke to the friend.

04:54.946 --> 04:56.426
He didn't even know
Jerry was staying here.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.907
The hunting trip appears
to have been successful.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.169
Wherever the
petty officer

05:00.212 --> 05:02.214
has gone to, it appears
he left in a hurry.

05:02.258 --> 05:03.520
This holiday turkey's

05:03.564 --> 05:04.956
not going to
last very long.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.568
Did his testimony
put him at risk?

05:07.611 --> 05:09.613
If this was a Mafia
trial, I'd say "yeah,"

05:09.657 --> 05:10.788
but not this case.

05:14.662 --> 05:16.577
You think different.

05:19.014 --> 05:20.755
I think there's
a lot of baseball bats

05:20.798 --> 05:21.799
lying around this place.

05:22.974 --> 05:24.585
Trust me, no one's going to care

05:24.628 --> 05:25.803
when the jury says guilty.

05:25.847 --> 05:28.240
There is another bat
in the guest bedroom.

05:29.285 --> 05:30.765
McGEE:
Boss...

05:30.808 --> 05:33.420
Spoke to the neighbors.

05:33.463 --> 05:35.639
If there was someone staying
here, they didn't know about it.

05:35.683 --> 05:37.728
I suggest we canvass
the local takeouts.

05:37.772 --> 05:39.774
It looks like the petty
officer was eating in a lot.

05:39.817 --> 05:40.992
Good idea.It was actually

05:41.036 --> 05:41.993
Agent McGee's
suggestion.

05:42.037 --> 05:43.125
Good idea.

05:45.432 --> 05:47.651
Agent Gibbs seems like a
capable investigator.

05:47.695 --> 05:48.652
There's none better.

05:48.696 --> 05:51.612
And, um, Agent DiNozzo?

05:51.655 --> 05:53.614
He's, um...

05:53.657 --> 05:55.703
also capable.

06:00.925 --> 06:03.145
And, uh... single.

06:03.188 --> 06:04.668
Excuse me?

06:04.712 --> 06:05.800
No, I just,
I noticed

06:05.843 --> 06:06.888
that he wasn't
wearing a ring.

06:08.019 --> 06:09.717
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

06:09.760 --> 06:10.631
Are you and he... ?

06:10.674 --> 06:11.893
No!

06:11.936 --> 06:13.851
No! My relationship with him

06:13.895 --> 06:15.418
is strictly professional,

06:15.462 --> 06:16.985
and barely that.

06:17.028 --> 06:18.465
Mm. Then you...

06:18.508 --> 06:19.770
you wouldn't
mind if I, uh...

06:21.990 --> 06:23.426
We're in the middle
of an investigation,

06:23.470 --> 06:24.558
and you, a trial.

06:24.601 --> 06:25.863
I know, I just...

06:25.907 --> 06:27.256
like to keep
my options open.

06:29.171 --> 06:31.042
Did you know
that the majority

06:31.086 --> 06:32.609
of people meet their
spouses at work?

06:32.653 --> 06:35.220
Huh. Uh...

06:35.264 --> 06:39.007
Not something I have
high hopes for.

06:41.749 --> 06:42.793
Let's bag it.

06:43.968 --> 06:45.927
Really.

06:45.970 --> 06:46.884
There's a giant
feathered turkey

06:46.928 --> 06:48.973
laying in the fridge, and

06:49.017 --> 06:50.018
that's all you're
going to say?

06:50.061 --> 06:51.498
What am I supposed to say?

06:51.541 --> 06:53.195
Well, I don't know.

06:53.238 --> 06:54.892
Maybe something like...

06:54.936 --> 06:57.721
"What do turkeys
eat on Christmas?

06:57.765 --> 06:59.375
"Nothing-- because
they're already stuffed."

06:59.419 --> 07:01.551
You feeling all right?Yeah. Are you?

07:01.595 --> 07:03.074
Fine.

07:03.118 --> 07:04.859
PO Neisler may
have forgotten

07:04.902 --> 07:06.338
his Christmas
turkey, but, uh,

07:06.382 --> 07:08.079
he took
his shotgun.

07:08.123 --> 07:09.254
Yeah, we're going to need to

07:09.298 --> 07:11.169
look at your case files.Of course.

07:11.213 --> 07:13.171
Of course, yeah.
Um... Agent DiNozzo,

07:13.215 --> 07:16.044
did you want to accompany me
back to my office?

07:16.087 --> 07:18.742
The files are heavy and I need
someone with strong arms.

07:22.398 --> 07:24.574
So long,
Mr. Professional.
Hm!

07:24.618 --> 07:26.315
You know, I think I'm just
going to stay here. I'm sure...

07:26.358 --> 07:27.142
Agent McGee can help you.

07:28.535 --> 07:31.102
Baseball bats
and a shotgun...

07:31.146 --> 07:32.756
That petty officer
was worried about something.

07:44.768 --> 07:45.943
Petty Officer Jerry Neisler.

07:45.987 --> 07:47.815
Born and raised in
Charlottesville.

07:47.858 --> 07:49.077
He served two
tours in Iraq

07:49.120 --> 07:50.731
before being reassigned
to the States.

07:50.774 --> 07:53.864
His, uh, record is, um,
hmm, interesting.

07:53.908 --> 07:55.039
Define interesting.

07:55.083 --> 07:58.434
Despite good reports
from his COs,

07:58.478 --> 07:59.870
he was repeatedly
transferred.

07:59.914 --> 08:01.306
TONY: Administration
communications.

08:01.350 --> 08:03.091
He doesn't play
well with others.

08:03.134 --> 08:05.310
Uh, actually, no,
it's nothing like that.

08:05.354 --> 08:06.834
Jerry's parents were
both psychologists,

08:06.877 --> 08:08.096
and he was an only child.

08:08.139 --> 08:09.880
Which means
what, exactly?

08:09.924 --> 08:11.665
Well, you kind of
have to meet him
to understand.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.276
Working on it.

08:14.319 --> 08:16.278
Along those lines,
I took the liberty of making

08:16.321 --> 08:19.499
a list of possible reasons
Jerry Neisler lost contact.

08:21.152 --> 08:23.111
Number one:

08:23.154 --> 08:25.243
witnesses with a personal
relation to the accused

08:25.287 --> 08:27.550
are sometimes
reluctant to testify.Yes.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.509
Yes, kind of like...

08:30.640 --> 08:31.989
...you know.

08:34.426 --> 08:37.125
Kind of like Robert
De Niro in Sleepers.
Yes.

08:37.168 --> 08:38.692
The movie, Tony.

08:41.172 --> 08:42.957
Number two:

08:43.000 --> 08:44.524
Someone is threatening
the witness.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.484
Well, why wouldn't Jerry call me
if he were threatened?

08:48.528 --> 08:49.616
Maybe he can't.

08:49.659 --> 08:50.921
[sighs]
Okay.

08:50.965 --> 08:52.401
This is everything that we have

08:52.444 --> 08:53.576
on the murder trial.

08:53.620 --> 08:54.577
The killer's name
is Samuel Hayes,

08:54.621 --> 08:55.839
but he doesn't exactly have

08:55.883 --> 08:57.493
a lot of friends that
would go to bat for him.

08:58.886 --> 09:00.278
His wife is dead,
and his daughter's

09:00.322 --> 09:01.802
a ward of the state.ZIVA:
Okay, this is

09:01.845 --> 09:02.759
getting really irritating.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.369
He's making
us look bad.

09:04.413 --> 09:05.806
McGee, do you have something?

09:07.982 --> 09:09.723
Uh, well,
I was just...

09:09.766 --> 09:12.334
I was saying how
it's also possible

09:12.377 --> 09:14.728
that the, um...
uh, disappearance

09:14.771 --> 09:16.468
has nothing to do
with the trial at all.

09:16.512 --> 09:19.167
Or... does.

09:22.387 --> 09:24.302
Uh, how do you want
to divide things up?

09:24.346 --> 09:25.434
My investigators can

09:25.477 --> 09:26.870
handle the BOLOs and
check the hospitals.

09:26.914 --> 09:28.350
We'll trace the petty
officer's prior movements,

09:28.393 --> 09:30.178
starting with his
hunting trip.ZIVA: Okay.

09:32.659 --> 09:33.573
Etymology,

09:33.616 --> 09:35.183
archaeology...

09:35.226 --> 09:36.401
Oh! Sociology,

09:36.445 --> 09:37.925
fluviomorphology...

09:37.968 --> 09:38.795
Fl-fluvio...
Fl-fluvio...

09:38.839 --> 09:40.492
...morphology.

09:40.536 --> 09:43.017
It's the study of the formation
of river channels.

09:43.060 --> 09:44.627
Fascinating.
I think.

09:44.671 --> 09:45.628
Yes. It's almost
as fascinating

09:45.672 --> 09:47.325
as hymenopterology

09:49.719 --> 09:51.068
Um, uh, hy-hym...

09:51.112 --> 09:53.027
uh, the, that is
the study of...

09:53.070 --> 09:54.028
Insects, Mr. Palmer.

09:54.071 --> 09:55.246
And specifically those

09:55.290 --> 09:58.162
with four diaphanous wings.

09:58.206 --> 10:01.296
Okay. Well, we may
have to prune this
list down just a...

10:01.339 --> 10:02.819
little bit, Doctor.
I think that

10:02.863 --> 10:03.820
Facebook has a limit

10:03.864 --> 10:04.734
to the number
of interests.

10:04.778 --> 10:05.648
Facebook?

10:06.954 --> 10:08.346
Yes, Jethro,
Facebook.

10:08.390 --> 10:10.218
Uh, that's that thing that...

10:10.261 --> 10:12.263
some people do things with.

10:12.307 --> 10:16.006
The term is
"social networking."

10:16.050 --> 10:17.399
Mm-hmm.
Uh, if I'm

10:17.442 --> 10:19.357
to maintain my proficiency
when I'm doing

10:19.401 --> 10:21.011
psychological autopsies,

10:21.055 --> 10:22.883
I have to keep up
with the latest

10:22.926 --> 10:24.493
cultural developments.

10:24.536 --> 10:26.147
As long as you keep
current on this case, Duck.Fear not.

10:26.190 --> 10:28.540
I may be new
to social networking,

10:28.584 --> 10:31.326
but the Mallards
invented multitasking.

10:31.369 --> 10:32.936
Mr. Palmer!

10:41.249 --> 10:43.468
Yes. Given your
interest in

10:43.512 --> 10:44.905
the petty officer's
hunting trip,

10:44.948 --> 10:46.646
and the lack of a human victim,

10:46.689 --> 10:48.778
I took the liberty of, uh...

10:50.606 --> 10:51.912
Oh, trust me, Jethro.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.609
You'll be glad I did.

10:53.653 --> 10:57.091
Cause of death was a shotgun
blast to the breastbone.

10:57.134 --> 10:58.179
As expected.

10:58.222 --> 11:00.311
What is not
expected, however,

11:00.355 --> 11:03.314
are these yellow-
and-tan tail feathers.

11:03.358 --> 11:05.055
That it?

11:05.099 --> 11:08.102
Well, the subspecies of turkey
on the East coast

11:08.145 --> 11:09.973
all have brown tail feathers.

11:10.017 --> 11:13.020
Duck, help me out here,
will you?

11:13.063 --> 11:15.979
Well, this is a Rio Grande
turkey, Jethro.

11:16.023 --> 11:17.677
And they are found almo...

11:17.720 --> 11:21.376
Ooh, add ornithology
to the list.

11:21.419 --> 11:24.422
They are found almost
exclusively in Kansas,

11:24.466 --> 11:26.424
Oklahoma or Texas.

11:26.468 --> 11:27.948
So, where did
Petty Officer Neisler

11:27.991 --> 11:29.863
get this one?

11:29.906 --> 11:31.125
He could've taken

11:31.168 --> 11:32.474
a cross-country
hunting trip.

11:32.517 --> 11:33.736
His CO ordered him

11:33.780 --> 11:35.607
not to leave the state
before the trial.

11:35.651 --> 11:36.870
Then if you want to find out

11:36.913 --> 11:38.741
where the petty officer
has been,

11:38.785 --> 11:40.874
I suggest that you determine
from whence

11:40.917 --> 11:41.918
this turkey came.

11:41.962 --> 11:43.833
[gobbling]

11:43.877 --> 11:45.792
[Jimmy snickers]

11:47.794 --> 11:49.534
[chuckles]

11:51.145 --> 11:53.060
Five, six, seven, eight...

11:53.103 --> 11:54.757
[lively instrumental playing]

11:58.805 --> 12:00.023
Hi, Gibbs.

12:00.067 --> 12:01.590
I betch you don't know
what this is called.

12:01.633 --> 12:03.157
Turkey trot.I'm impressed.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.898
You want to join?

12:04.941 --> 12:07.552
Not really.Well, can I finish?

12:10.294 --> 12:12.688
All right.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.168
[music stops]

12:14.211 --> 12:15.647
I can see that you're here
to talk turkey.

12:15.691 --> 12:16.648
Get it?

12:16.692 --> 12:18.085
Abbs...

12:18.128 --> 12:19.390
Sorry, I'm just,
I'm excited, Gibbs.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.566
because I think that
I already figured out

12:21.610 --> 12:23.960
what I figured out you
came down here to ask me.

12:24.004 --> 12:25.614
Where'd this come from?

12:25.657 --> 12:29.574
I ran the turkey's DNA through
the NWTFDNAD.

12:29.618 --> 12:33.187
It's the National Wild Turkey
Federation DNA Database.

12:33.230 --> 12:35.667
They really need
a new acronym.

12:35.711 --> 12:38.540
Turkey DNA database?I know.

12:38.583 --> 12:40.672
It's a wonderful
time to be alive, Gibbs.

12:40.716 --> 12:41.891
And with it,

12:41.935 --> 12:43.153
I can tell you why

12:43.197 --> 12:44.807
there was a
Rio Grande turkey in

12:44.851 --> 12:46.635
Petty Officer Neisler's
refrigerator.
Why?

12:46.678 --> 12:48.158
Well, it turns out,

12:48.202 --> 12:50.857
if a state has a turkey
overpopulation problem,

12:50.900 --> 12:52.684
they'll catch and release

12:52.728 --> 12:54.991
to other states
that need a boost.

12:55.035 --> 12:56.210
They keep records?

12:56.253 --> 12:57.341
Good ones.

12:57.385 --> 12:59.691
So there was a
pre-Christmas release

12:59.735 --> 13:01.041
two weeks ago,
out of Virginia.

13:01.084 --> 13:02.085
All the DNA is stored.

13:02.129 --> 13:04.131
So, if a bird is
in the system,

13:04.174 --> 13:06.655
we can pinpoint exactly
which hunting ground

13:06.698 --> 13:08.004
it was released to.

13:08.048 --> 13:09.049
Which I did.

13:10.267 --> 13:12.487
And here it is.
Look familiar?

13:12.530 --> 13:14.837
The last hit on our missing
guy's credit card

13:14.881 --> 13:16.839
is ten miles from here.

13:16.883 --> 13:19.407
Yeah, so I figure
maybe he's hiding out
in a familiar woods.

13:19.450 --> 13:21.931
Which is what I would do
if I were him...

13:21.975 --> 13:23.367
without the hunting part.

13:23.411 --> 13:24.978
Which means that
I wouldn't be him.

13:25.021 --> 13:26.414
I would still be me then.

13:32.724 --> 13:34.814
[lively music resumes]

13:44.171 --> 13:47.304
[gunfire in distance]

13:47.348 --> 13:49.263
[sighs]

13:49.306 --> 13:51.918
Oh! If I never see another
dead turkey again,

13:51.961 --> 13:53.658
it will be too soon.

13:53.702 --> 13:55.486
Well, you're probably
gonna see one Christmas day.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.880
Ha! Not this year.
I'm going skiing.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.534
Really? With who?

13:59.577 --> 14:02.711
With, uh, my friend
from Miami.

14:02.754 --> 14:04.582
He lived in the French Alps
for a while.

14:04.626 --> 14:06.236
And he says he
misses the snow.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.759
Uh-huh.

14:07.803 --> 14:11.241
Hey. Excuse me. NCIS.

14:11.285 --> 14:12.721
You seen this guy?

14:14.854 --> 14:15.811
Nope.

14:15.855 --> 14:16.943
No. How about you?
Mm-mm.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.205
No.

14:18.248 --> 14:20.729
We have been to
three parks already.

14:20.772 --> 14:22.644
The lead was thin
enough to begin with.

14:22.687 --> 14:24.037
Perhaps Abby's sending
us on a wild...

14:26.213 --> 14:27.562
Oh, never mind.

14:32.828 --> 14:34.177
He's here.

14:34.221 --> 14:35.787
How do you know?MAN:
That's the guy!

14:35.831 --> 14:37.354
Hey! Don't move!
Whoa, whoa!
Easy.

14:37.398 --> 14:38.834
Found him!

14:38.878 --> 14:40.096
Don't shoot.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.706
I won't testify.
I promise.

14:41.750 --> 14:42.707
NCIS.

14:42.751 --> 14:43.883
Nobody's gonna kill you.

14:43.926 --> 14:44.927
Thank God.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.494
We got it from here.

14:46.537 --> 14:48.409
When I saw you
flashing my photo.

14:48.452 --> 14:50.759
She's got the eyes
of a killer.

14:50.802 --> 14:53.370
And you with that suit on?
Figured I was dead.

14:55.242 --> 14:57.722
Somebody threatening you?
Is that why you're running?

14:57.766 --> 15:00.377
I got these badly
worded e-mails warning
me not to testify.

15:00.421 --> 15:02.553
Said if I told anyone,
they'd kill me.

15:02.597 --> 15:04.816
So I decided to lay low
until the trial.

15:04.860 --> 15:06.949
Stayed at a buddy's.
But they found me.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.342
The second warning said

15:08.385 --> 15:10.300
they weren't hugged enough
as a child.

15:10.344 --> 15:12.389
Then I got this.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.087
It is District
Attorney Walsh.

15:14.130 --> 15:15.436
No.
Don't answer that.
Why not?

15:15.479 --> 15:16.263
She's the only one who knew
where I was staying.

15:16.306 --> 15:18.004
I didn't tell anyone else.

15:18.047 --> 15:19.483
She has to be in on it.The DA?

15:19.527 --> 15:21.050
Yeah.

15:21.094 --> 15:23.574
[ringing continues]

15:23.618 --> 15:25.011
Yeah, this is Gibbs.

15:25.054 --> 15:27.752
This is Walsh.
Any luck finding Jerry?Uh-uh.

15:27.796 --> 15:30.190
Nothing.No.

15:30.233 --> 15:31.452
We still haven't
found him yet.

15:38.589 --> 15:39.373
The original is
down with Abby.

15:39.416 --> 15:40.940
So is Jerry.

15:40.983 --> 15:43.638
They're working on I.D.'ing
the guy who made it.

15:43.681 --> 15:45.727
The old knife to the neck.

15:45.770 --> 15:46.902
Reminds me of...

15:46.946 --> 15:48.121
Reminds you of what?

15:48.164 --> 15:51.080
Reminds you of an
old fraternity prank?

15:51.124 --> 15:52.299
A Halloween movie?

15:52.342 --> 15:53.691
I know what you're doing.

15:53.735 --> 15:55.128
And I know what you're doing.What am I doing?

15:55.171 --> 15:56.999
I don't know.
But it's bugging me

15:57.043 --> 15:58.174
to such a degree...

15:58.218 --> 15:59.480
I know what
we're not doing.

15:59.523 --> 16:01.090
Did a complete background
check on the DA.

16:01.134 --> 16:02.526
Nothing jumps out.

16:02.570 --> 16:04.702
Well, she may not be the source
of the leak,

16:04.746 --> 16:06.313
but she could've told someone
where Jerry was staying.

16:06.356 --> 16:07.705
She did not tell
her assistant.

16:07.749 --> 16:10.360
Per your request,
I made inquiries.

16:10.404 --> 16:11.535
Discreet inquiries.

16:11.579 --> 16:14.799
It appears the DA
was the only person

16:14.843 --> 16:16.410
who knew Jerry's location.

16:16.453 --> 16:17.454
Shall I arrange
a safe house?

16:17.498 --> 16:18.978
He stays with us.

16:19.021 --> 16:21.893
I wasn't able to trace
the e-mails that Jerry was sent,

16:21.937 --> 16:23.156
but the intent
was very clear.

16:23.199 --> 16:24.244
To stop him
from testifying.

16:24.287 --> 16:25.593
Which means
our killer walks.

16:25.636 --> 16:28.291
No, I think the answer is
in the trial somewhere.

16:28.335 --> 16:30.119
I suggest we divide up
the case files by...

16:30.163 --> 16:32.600
The trial centers
around accused killer
Samuel Hayes, 41.

16:32.643 --> 16:35.603
Worked as a private
investigator for years,

16:35.646 --> 16:37.387
digging up dirt on
bigwigs for bigwigs.

16:37.431 --> 16:40.434
However, despite
his somewhat grimy job,

16:40.477 --> 16:42.305
he was a family man.

16:42.349 --> 16:44.655
Had a reputation
as a stand-up guy.

16:44.699 --> 16:46.483
Then his world fell apart:
His wife was killed

16:46.527 --> 16:48.268
in a car accident;
he started drinking.

16:48.311 --> 16:50.096
His daughter ended up
a ward of the state.

16:50.139 --> 16:51.314
He ended up in the street.

16:51.358 --> 16:52.489
That's right, boss.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.752
Hayes made a living
working as muscle

16:54.796 --> 16:56.972
for whoever would hire him.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.714
Then, one night, he mugged a
brother and sister in an alley.

16:59.757 --> 17:02.717
Shot and killed the sister.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.110
Katie Gray.

17:04.153 --> 17:05.807
TONY: And our petty officer
saw the whole thing.

17:05.850 --> 17:08.375
DiNozzo, find out who
the killer worked for. Ziva.

17:08.418 --> 17:10.203
I will stay on the DA.

17:10.246 --> 17:11.943
McGee, I want to talk
to the brother.
Got it.

17:13.728 --> 17:15.556
MAN:
Katie had just taken me out

17:15.599 --> 17:17.079
for my birthday.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.341
Benihana.

17:18.385 --> 17:20.952
It was a
family tradition.

17:22.345 --> 17:25.087
Used to be a Polaroid.

17:25.131 --> 17:27.089
It's not really the same now.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.526
But nothing was the same
after our parents died.

17:29.570 --> 17:31.354
Your sister got custody of you?

17:31.398 --> 17:32.442
That was my big sister.

17:32.486 --> 17:34.488
Always looking out for me.

17:34.531 --> 17:36.620
Even on the night
she was killed.

17:39.319 --> 17:41.364
We took a shortcut home.

17:43.497 --> 17:46.413
And this... this guy
pulled a gun on us.

17:46.456 --> 17:48.415
Katie didn't
even hesitate.

17:48.458 --> 17:50.025
She jumped right in front.

17:50.069 --> 17:53.028
I don't remember
what happened next.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.812
Just the blood.

17:54.856 --> 17:56.597
You weren't able
to identify the killer.

17:56.640 --> 17:57.859
I couldn't be sure.

17:57.902 --> 18:00.688
Made the mistake of telling
the police that.

18:00.731 --> 18:03.604
Not a mistake. You just want
the right guy to pay for this.

18:03.647 --> 18:05.127
But we know who
the right guy is!

18:05.171 --> 18:06.520
There's a witness!

18:06.563 --> 18:10.045
Or there was.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.047
The DA told me
he's missing.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.570
She say anything else?

18:13.614 --> 18:14.832
That you're
looking for him.

18:14.876 --> 18:16.443
But you need to look harder.

18:16.486 --> 18:19.010
That witness
saw everything.

18:22.013 --> 18:27.845
You know, my-my parents raised
us to forgive and forget.

18:27.889 --> 18:29.760
But all I want right now...

18:29.804 --> 18:31.893
Payback.

18:31.936 --> 18:33.895
Justice.

18:33.938 --> 18:36.724
You have to find that
witness, Agent Gibbs.

18:39.944 --> 18:41.685
[holiday music playing]

18:41.729 --> 18:43.644
You have very symmetric
zygomatic arches.

18:43.687 --> 18:45.863
As long as they help you
catch whoever's after me.

18:45.907 --> 18:47.648
Well, taking precise
measurements of your face,

18:47.691 --> 18:50.433
I can extrapolate
the exact dimensions

18:50.477 --> 18:52.392
of the knife-holding hand.

18:52.435 --> 18:54.350
It'll be useful
when we get a suspect.

18:54.394 --> 18:56.178
Hmm. Smart.
I can see why

18:56.222 --> 18:58.137
Agent McGee was
interested in you.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.660
Excuse me?

18:59.703 --> 19:01.531
When he brought me down here

19:01.575 --> 19:04.055
he didn't seem too comfortable
leaving me alone.

19:04.099 --> 19:05.187
I love this song.

19:05.231 --> 19:07.798
I've had, um,

19:07.842 --> 19:10.497
problems with visitors.

19:10.540 --> 19:13.326
So, he was just being
overprotective.

19:13.369 --> 19:14.805
Of what? Your butt?

19:14.849 --> 19:16.894
He couldn't stop
checking it out

19:16.938 --> 19:19.375
when your back was turned.Really?

19:19.419 --> 19:22.030
But I can see why you probably
wanted to keep things casual.

19:22.073 --> 19:23.727
And why is that?

19:23.771 --> 19:25.555
What if he was the one?

19:25.599 --> 19:26.861
You're obviously married
to your work.

19:26.904 --> 19:28.428
It's too soon
to meet the one.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.170
Are we done?

19:31.213 --> 19:32.258
Yes, very.

19:32.301 --> 19:33.563
Gibbs,

19:33.607 --> 19:35.130
can you make him
go away, please?

19:35.174 --> 19:36.740
Go with him.
Take a look at some photos.

19:36.784 --> 19:38.786
Sure.
Hey, I'm Jerry.

19:38.829 --> 19:39.700
Forensics from
the murder trial.

19:39.743 --> 19:41.005
You take a look yet?

19:41.049 --> 19:43.573
Oh, yeah.
All they got is

19:43.617 --> 19:45.836
a positive GSR test on
the alleged killer's shirt.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.273
It means he
fired a weapon.

19:47.316 --> 19:49.057
Not who he fired at.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.799
Yeah. The case is gonna
hinge on Jerry's testimony.

19:51.842 --> 19:53.627
I'm sure he has
a lot to say.

19:53.670 --> 19:55.237
TONY: I know someone
else who might.

19:55.281 --> 19:57.631
I got that list of people
the killer was working for.

19:57.674 --> 19:58.980
Drug dealers,
loan sharks.

19:59.023 --> 20:00.938
They gotta be hoping
he beats the murder rap.

20:00.982 --> 20:02.244
Hayes gets convicted,
he could cop a plea.

20:02.288 --> 20:03.811
Rat any of them out.

20:03.854 --> 20:06.030
Gives them all motive
to try and shut Jerry up.

20:06.074 --> 20:07.423
This guy's interesting.

20:07.467 --> 20:10.905
Smitty Brown. Dealing in
black-market weapons, drugs.

20:10.948 --> 20:12.820
Been making a lot of visits
to Hayes in the joint.

20:12.863 --> 20:14.343
Pick him up.

20:14.387 --> 20:15.823
Can't find him.

20:15.866 --> 20:18.565
He disappeared the day
Jerry received the DVD.

20:18.608 --> 20:19.740
I want to talk to Hayes.

20:19.783 --> 20:20.828
Already made arrangements.

20:20.871 --> 20:21.959
Good job.

20:24.048 --> 20:25.224
Again.

20:25.267 --> 20:27.226
Thanks, boss.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.445
You feeling okay, DiNozzo?

20:29.489 --> 20:30.968
Never felt better.

20:32.405 --> 20:33.275
Hmm.

20:35.146 --> 20:40.891
Um, I would stay away from
that Jerry, if I were you.

20:43.416 --> 20:46.114
GUARD: Holler when
you're done, sir.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.683
What did I do now?

20:51.250 --> 20:52.338
GUARD:
Close six!

20:52.381 --> 20:53.295
[lock buzzes]

20:56.255 --> 20:59.823
You know this guy?

20:59.867 --> 21:03.000
Yeah, I know him.
I helped with collections

21:03.044 --> 21:04.567
when customers were behind
in their payments.

21:04.611 --> 21:05.699
You know where he is?

21:05.742 --> 21:07.918
Now how would I know that?

21:07.962 --> 21:09.920
He's your
number-one visitor.

21:09.964 --> 21:13.184
Actually, he's
your only visitor.

21:13.228 --> 21:15.404
Sorry, can't help you.

21:15.448 --> 21:17.624
What'd you guys
talk about?

21:17.667 --> 21:21.454
Keynesian economics,
Paleolithic migrations.

21:21.497 --> 21:22.846
You know, guy stuff.

21:22.890 --> 21:25.806
Don't remember.

21:27.590 --> 21:28.591
Before.

21:30.114 --> 21:31.290
After.

21:34.162 --> 21:35.816
You remember this?

21:35.859 --> 21:38.993
Your old boss tell you that
if you kept your mouth shut,

21:39.036 --> 21:40.734
he'd take care of your
witness for you?

21:40.777 --> 21:42.257
I don't have to answer you.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.346
Where is he?

21:44.390 --> 21:46.217
What're you
gonna do, hmm?

21:46.261 --> 21:49.090
The D.A.'s already
asking for the death penalty.

21:49.133 --> 21:50.744
Yeah?

21:50.787 --> 21:52.963
It's an airtight case.

21:54.835 --> 21:56.576
Officer.

21:56.619 --> 21:57.664
GUARD:
Open six!

21:57.707 --> 21:58.882
[lock buzzes]

22:13.549 --> 22:15.334
Should I take
my shoes off?

22:15.377 --> 22:16.552
I wish your wouldn't.

22:16.596 --> 22:18.337
Never stayed at
a safe house before.

22:18.380 --> 22:19.599
What's for dinner?

22:19.642 --> 22:22.471
Beans.

22:24.299 --> 22:25.779
Hmm.

22:25.822 --> 22:28.042
So you met with the killer.

22:28.085 --> 22:30.610
Think he was after me?

22:30.653 --> 22:32.655
I think he knew something.

22:32.699 --> 22:34.657
I saw him at a hearing.

22:34.701 --> 22:37.617
Seems like a sad,
sorry guy.

22:37.660 --> 22:40.707
Kind of reminds
me of you.

22:40.750 --> 22:42.578
Both live alone, no family.

22:42.622 --> 22:44.145
Hey.Just saying.

22:44.188 --> 22:45.407
Look at her.

22:45.451 --> 22:47.627
You can tell she's
got good taste.

22:47.670 --> 22:50.543
Never let you get away
with this lumpy couch
if she was still here.

22:50.586 --> 22:53.589
But seems like you're
trying to make some changes.

22:53.633 --> 22:54.982
Some kind of
home makeover.

22:55.025 --> 22:57.332
Finally cleaning up
these magazines.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.378
All right.

22:59.421 --> 23:01.467
There's a cot down in the
basement, right through there.

23:01.510 --> 23:03.164
Can I use the phone?

23:03.207 --> 23:05.471
I told my CO I'd let him know
where I'm staying tonight.

23:08.604 --> 23:09.953
You spoke to your CO?

23:09.997 --> 23:11.390
I called him
this afternoon.

23:11.433 --> 23:13.566
Felt bad about
not giving him a heads up.

23:13.609 --> 23:15.916
Get down in the basement.

23:15.959 --> 23:17.874
What's wrong?Get in the basement!
Go! Go! Go!

23:17.918 --> 23:19.354
All right. Okay.

23:33.934 --> 23:36.458
[door opens]

23:36.502 --> 23:37.764
Where is he?

23:37.807 --> 23:40.288
He's downstairs
in the basement.

23:40.331 --> 23:42.333
You have no right
to withhold my witness from me.

23:42.377 --> 23:43.465
This is my case.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.249
It's our case.

23:46.860 --> 23:49.558
We need to talk.
Sit down.

23:49.602 --> 23:51.342
You've done enough talking.

23:51.386 --> 23:53.867
Who gave you permission to visit
Hayes in prison today?

23:55.869 --> 23:58.262
I don't need your permission.

23:58.306 --> 23:59.742
You sure about that?

23:59.786 --> 24:01.396
Did you know that after
you spoke to him

24:01.440 --> 24:02.789
there was an attempt
on his life?

24:02.832 --> 24:05.095
He'll live, but the trial
has been postponed.

24:05.139 --> 24:07.446
Which just puts
Jerry in more jeopardy.

24:07.489 --> 24:09.448
You're not helping my case.
You're going to ruin it.

24:17.194 --> 24:19.153
I demand that you hand over
custody of Jerry.

24:19.196 --> 24:20.850
He is my witness.That's not going to happen.

24:20.894 --> 24:22.156
Not until I find out
who's trying

24:22.199 --> 24:23.200
to stop him
from testifying.

24:23.244 --> 24:24.550
Yeah, we want
the same thing.

24:24.593 --> 24:25.855
Really now? Do we?

24:25.899 --> 24:26.900
WALSH:
What are you suggesting?

24:26.943 --> 24:28.771
Jerry said you
were the only one

24:28.815 --> 24:30.251
who knew where he
was staying.

24:30.294 --> 24:32.166
You think I'm trying
to sabotage my own trial?

24:32.209 --> 24:35.996
I didn't tell a soul
where Jerry was.

24:36.039 --> 24:37.780
Whoever was threatening him
must have been following him.

24:39.869 --> 24:41.697
What else aren't you telling me?

24:41.741 --> 24:44.352
Withholding information

24:44.395 --> 24:45.745
just further
jeopardizes this case.

24:49.749 --> 24:51.620
We think we know
who's after Jerry.

24:51.664 --> 24:53.143
The accused murderer...

24:53.187 --> 24:54.710
TONY:
Has been visited
several times

24:54.754 --> 24:55.581
in prison by this man.

24:58.366 --> 25:00.281
Who is he?

25:00.324 --> 25:02.196
Former employer Smitty Brown.

25:02.239 --> 25:03.502
McGEE:
We think he's worried
that your killer's

25:03.545 --> 25:04.764
going to rat him out
if convicted.

25:04.807 --> 25:06.853
Cut him some kind of deal.

25:06.896 --> 25:08.898
But if Jerry does not testify,
no deals to cut.

25:08.942 --> 25:10.030
And why haven't
you picked him up?

25:10.073 --> 25:12.119
Can't find him.

25:12.162 --> 25:14.556
Well, I may be able
to help with that.

25:14.600 --> 25:17.603
My office has a number
of active informants
in the street.

25:17.646 --> 25:19.779
Fine. But Jerry's
staying here.

25:19.822 --> 25:22.433
Only on the condition
that you keep me apprised
of any new information.

25:26.481 --> 25:28.222
[e-mail chimes]

25:28.265 --> 25:31.138
Hey, boss, I just
got an e-mail from Abby.

25:31.181 --> 25:33.488
Says she has some
new information.

25:33.532 --> 25:36.883
Should I go after
the District Attorney?

25:36.926 --> 25:38.711
No.

25:38.754 --> 25:39.929
MAN: Okay, dude.
Here you go.

25:39.973 --> 25:41.061
20 bucks.
20 bucks!

25:41.104 --> 25:42.584
Just to drink
a gallon of eggnog?

25:42.628 --> 25:44.238
MAN: Without puking, though.
All right?

25:44.281 --> 25:46.196
DRINKER:
Deal.

25:46.240 --> 25:49.243
MAN:
Chug, chug, chug...

25:49.286 --> 25:50.592
Bet you can't wait to see
how that ends.

25:50.636 --> 25:51.941
Mm.

25:51.985 --> 25:53.508
Badly.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.163
But I think I'm going
to be able to use this

25:56.206 --> 25:57.947
to track down the guy
that made Jerry's DVD.

25:57.991 --> 25:59.862
Of course you can, Abbs.

25:59.906 --> 26:01.777
Well, I've been hitting
a lot of brick walls.

26:01.821 --> 26:03.257
There's no fingerprints,

26:03.300 --> 26:05.955
and this product is sold in,
like, a thousand places.

26:05.999 --> 26:07.609
But then I
noticed something.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.437
Two dead pixels.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.526
There and there.

26:11.570 --> 26:16.096
The dead pixels have to be
from the camera that was
used to shoot the video.

26:16.139 --> 26:17.532
So it's sort of like
a fingerprint.

26:17.576 --> 26:18.881
I started scanning

26:18.925 --> 26:21.144
other video upload sites
like CyberVid and YouTube

26:21.188 --> 26:24.626
to try to find other
videos that had the
same missing pixels.

26:24.670 --> 26:26.236
That's enough
to make an I.D.?

26:26.280 --> 26:28.848
Well, with all the
possible combinations,

26:28.891 --> 26:31.415
the odds of a match
being a coincidence

26:31.459 --> 26:32.852
is extremely remote.

26:32.895 --> 26:35.376
[typing]

26:35.419 --> 26:36.595
You got a match.

26:36.638 --> 26:39.336
Actually, I got four.

26:39.380 --> 26:42.122
And all I needed to do
to narrow them down

26:42.165 --> 26:44.341
was to measure the
hands in the video,

26:44.385 --> 26:46.474
and then to compare them
to the hand in Jerry's video.

26:46.517 --> 26:48.824
If I get a match,
we got our guy.

26:48.868 --> 26:50.130
And I got a match.

26:51.305 --> 26:54.613
This video was uploaded
four years ago.

26:54.656 --> 26:57.311
The profile belongs
to a guy named Joe Casey.

26:57.354 --> 26:59.879
He is our cameraman.Send it up to McGee.
We're gonna need a BOLO.

26:59.922 --> 27:02.969
Actually, no, you're not.

27:03.012 --> 27:05.014
Joe Casey has been a guest

27:05.058 --> 27:06.973
in the county morgue
since this morning.

27:07.016 --> 27:09.758
Joe Casey.
23 years old.

27:09.802 --> 27:13.501
Already had a record
for B&E, larceny,
grand theft auto.

27:13.544 --> 27:15.764
Had a rep as
a gun for hire.

27:15.808 --> 27:18.158
We're thinking that
Smitty Brown hired him
to scare the witness.

27:18.201 --> 27:19.812
Then took him out
when he was done.

27:19.855 --> 27:21.596
DUCKY:
Our local M.E. disagrees.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.817
When I picked Casey up,
he told me that he believed

27:24.860 --> 27:27.341
that the cause of death
was an animal mauling.

27:27.384 --> 27:29.386
And you don't, Duck?

27:32.912 --> 27:34.130
Duck?

27:34.174 --> 27:36.045
Uh, I'm sorry.

27:36.089 --> 27:41.268
Uh, well, this liver doesn't
seem so much mauled as inflated.

27:41.311 --> 27:42.922
Inflated?

27:42.965 --> 27:45.011
Yes. literally to the
point of exploding.

27:45.054 --> 27:47.056
And look here.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.667
A number of these organs--

27:48.710 --> 27:50.843
well, they appear to have
freezer burn,

27:50.886 --> 27:54.107
and yet the rest of the body
shows no signs of...

27:55.369 --> 27:56.718
Duck.

27:56.762 --> 27:57.980
Why are you
so distracted?

27:58.024 --> 27:59.721
I apologize.

27:59.765 --> 28:01.462
JIMMY:
Dr. Mallard has received
several e-mails

28:01.505 --> 28:05.074
from various, uh,
lady friends

28:05.118 --> 28:07.686
since posting
his online account.

28:09.470 --> 28:12.081
Well, some of them
are quite provocative.

28:12.125 --> 28:14.388
I'm having difficulty
concentrating.

28:16.172 --> 28:17.130
[chuckles]

28:17.173 --> 28:20.133
Freezer burn?

28:20.176 --> 28:22.831
Yes, freezer burns
throughout the thoracic

28:22.875 --> 28:24.267
and abdominal regions.

28:24.311 --> 28:26.879
I mean, I'm simply
at a loss to explain it.

28:26.922 --> 28:28.184
However, Mr. Palmer

28:28.228 --> 28:30.273
may be able to
help you narrow

28:30.317 --> 28:32.493
the search parameters
for this man's killer.

28:32.536 --> 28:34.016
He made an astute discovery.

28:34.060 --> 28:35.583
JIMMY:
This tattoo right here,

28:35.626 --> 28:36.802
it's new.

28:36.845 --> 28:38.978
The micropunctures
had barely begun to heal

28:39.021 --> 28:41.154
when he was murdered.

28:41.197 --> 28:43.373
I would say that this man
was killed within minutes

28:43.417 --> 28:45.027
of this tattoo
being completed.

28:45.071 --> 28:47.247
So if you can find
the parlor...

28:47.290 --> 28:49.292
Somebody may have seen
something.

28:50.598 --> 28:51.947
Good work, Duck.

28:51.991 --> 28:53.732
Actually, I'm the one

28:53.775 --> 28:55.734
who-who did...

28:57.736 --> 28:59.215
Good work, Dr. Mallard.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.219
ZIVA: The Dumpster where
they found Joe Casey's body

29:03.263 --> 29:05.874
is behind this
building, and that

29:05.918 --> 29:08.616
is the only tattoo parlor

29:08.659 --> 29:10.836
within a five mile radius.

29:10.879 --> 29:12.272
You got Casey's photos?

29:12.315 --> 29:14.883
Yeah. Tony had them
waiting for me on my desk.

29:14.927 --> 29:18.191
And, um, he also
had updated

29:18.234 --> 29:20.149
all of my BOLOs
on Smitty Brown.

29:21.585 --> 29:22.848
Well...

29:24.719 --> 29:27.069
...the joke's getting
kind of old, isn't it?

29:27.113 --> 29:29.680
I no longer think
he's joking.

29:29.724 --> 29:32.596
Look, Tony is a
great investigator,

29:32.640 --> 29:34.294
don't get me wrong,
but the closest he likes

29:34.337 --> 29:36.209
coming to filling out paperwork

29:36.252 --> 29:38.385
is renewing his Maxim
subscription.

29:38.428 --> 29:40.996
I know. Which is why
I'm growing so concerned.

29:41.040 --> 29:43.085
You know what,
actually I am, too.

29:43.129 --> 29:45.000
He gave me half his
French fries at lunch.

29:45.044 --> 29:47.394
One of us has to confront him.

29:47.437 --> 29:48.874
And tell him what?

29:48.917 --> 29:50.701
Why aren't you acting like
a 14-year-old anymore?

29:50.745 --> 29:53.443
I was going to say more
like a 12-year-old, but yes.

29:56.707 --> 29:58.274
Is that Smitty?

29:58.318 --> 30:00.015
I believe so.

30:00.059 --> 30:03.062
Smitty!

30:03.105 --> 30:04.846
Who wants to know?

30:04.890 --> 30:07.501
I'll make you a list.

30:15.857 --> 30:18.425
Don't I get a phone call
or something?

30:24.039 --> 30:25.998
I'm gonna want that back.

30:29.349 --> 30:31.699
You want that back, too?

30:31.742 --> 30:33.483
It's called
a wasp knife, right?

30:33.527 --> 30:36.225
Used by hunters
to take down big game.

30:36.269 --> 30:37.313
Injects compressed gas--

30:37.357 --> 30:38.837
freezing and exploding
internal organs.

30:38.880 --> 30:39.925
Found it in your car.

30:39.968 --> 30:41.361
It's a murder weapon.

30:41.404 --> 30:42.884
[laughs] I don't even
know this guy.

30:42.928 --> 30:45.234
Why would I want
to kill him?Tying up loose ends.

30:45.278 --> 30:47.062
I don't have any loose ends.

30:47.106 --> 30:48.759
TONY:
Samuel Hayes.

30:48.803 --> 30:50.544
On trial for murder.
Going to get the chair.

30:50.587 --> 30:52.241
You were afraid that
if he gets convicted,

30:52.285 --> 30:54.504
he'll turn you in
for a lighter sentence.

30:54.548 --> 30:55.941
GIBBS:
He had you on dealing,

30:55.984 --> 30:57.290
gun running.

30:57.333 --> 30:59.161
TONY: Then you hired
this punk, Joe Casey,

30:59.205 --> 30:59.901
to intimidate
the witness.

30:59.945 --> 31:01.250
Then you killed him.

31:01.294 --> 31:02.556
You guys got this all wrong.

31:02.599 --> 31:04.079
TONY: And when you
couldn't stop the trial,

31:04.123 --> 31:06.299
you tried to have
Hayes whacked in prison.

31:06.342 --> 31:07.430
I didn't try and kill anybody.

31:07.474 --> 31:10.216
Casey tried to kill me.

31:10.259 --> 31:12.609
I heard somebody was
messing with a witness

31:12.653 --> 31:14.046
in the Hayes trial,
same as you.

31:14.089 --> 31:15.656
So I put the word out
on the street--

31:15.699 --> 31:17.919
see if I could find out
who it was. You ask anybody.

31:17.963 --> 31:19.878
That's where I met
this Casey guy.

31:19.921 --> 31:24.752
I don't know who
he was working for,
but it wasn't me.

31:24.795 --> 31:26.972
I told him to back off
the witness.

31:27.015 --> 31:28.843
He made a move.

31:28.887 --> 31:29.931
It was self-defense.

31:29.975 --> 31:32.151
End of story.

31:32.194 --> 31:34.327
You told him to back off?Well, that's the
part you're not getting.

31:34.370 --> 31:35.937
I don't want Hayes
out of prison.

31:35.981 --> 31:37.243
I need him in prison.

31:37.286 --> 31:40.159
I needed a guy
inside the joint

31:40.202 --> 31:42.291
to help me out...

31:43.727 --> 31:47.122
...in this little
side business I had going.

31:47.166 --> 31:49.429
My last dealer
got executed.

31:49.472 --> 31:52.127
Hayes agreed
to be my new guy.

31:52.171 --> 31:55.348
What'd he get out of it?

31:55.391 --> 31:57.916
Just kept asking me
to make deposits

31:57.959 --> 32:00.222
to some life insurance
policy he had.

32:00.266 --> 32:02.964
TONY:
Life insurance?

32:03.008 --> 32:04.966
For a guy about to get
the death penalty?

32:05.010 --> 32:06.881
I don't know what
his deal is, all right?

32:06.925 --> 32:09.623
I just know what the deal was.

32:09.666 --> 32:11.581
And I can prove it.

32:19.024 --> 32:20.155
But you and Tony...

32:20.199 --> 32:21.504
Enough! We're just friends.

32:21.548 --> 32:22.810
There's nothing
different about him.

32:22.853 --> 32:24.594
All right.
Hey.

32:24.638 --> 32:27.467
You recognize him?No.

32:27.510 --> 32:29.338
TONY: But the rest of
Smitty's story checks out.

32:29.382 --> 32:31.732
He did have an inside guy in
prison who was dealing for him

32:31.775 --> 32:32.994
recently executed.

32:33.038 --> 32:34.300
McGEE:
I was also able

32:34.343 --> 32:36.955
to confirm that
he was making Hayes'

32:36.998 --> 32:38.521
insurance policy payments.

32:38.565 --> 32:40.915
ZIVA:
In fact, Hayes

32:40.959 --> 32:42.308
recently placed a call
to his broker

32:42.351 --> 32:43.744
to confirm the policy pays,

32:43.787 --> 32:45.267
even if he is executed.

32:45.311 --> 32:46.312
Who's the beneficiary?

32:46.355 --> 32:48.096
Well...

32:48.140 --> 32:49.445
Thank you.

32:51.360 --> 32:53.884
His daughter.

32:53.928 --> 32:56.191
Still no leads on whoever tried
to kill Hayes in prison, though.

32:56.235 --> 32:57.584
DUCKY:
Because no one did.

32:57.627 --> 32:59.020
I just got off the phone
with the prison doctor.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.761
He now believes

33:00.804 --> 33:02.241
Hayes' wounds were
self-inflicted.

33:04.634 --> 33:07.159
He disguised
his suicide attempt.

33:07.202 --> 33:09.204
McGEE: But the guy thought
he was going to walk.

33:09.248 --> 33:10.249
Why try and kill himself?

33:10.292 --> 33:12.425
Seems pretty obvious to me.

33:15.906 --> 33:17.821
I'm sure you guys would've
figured it out eventually.

33:17.865 --> 33:21.042
Hayes doesn't want to
beat the murder rap.

33:21.086 --> 33:22.609
He's given up.

33:22.652 --> 33:25.438
He just wants to die and leave
one last gift to his daughter.

33:25.481 --> 33:26.613
But... he thought
I was missing.

33:26.656 --> 33:28.093
Which meant
he'd go free, so

33:28.136 --> 33:29.746
he tried to kill himself.

33:29.790 --> 33:31.574
[sighs deeply]

33:31.618 --> 33:33.054
Another sad guy.

33:35.578 --> 33:38.538
Then, uh, who has been
intimidating the witness?

33:38.581 --> 33:41.193
ZIVA: Somebody is trying to
get this guy out of prison.

33:41.236 --> 33:42.498
McGEE:
Hey, boss, I think

33:42.542 --> 33:44.761
I found something here.

33:44.805 --> 33:47.068
Take a look at the call log
from Smitty's burn phone.

33:47.112 --> 33:49.201
There are several calls
from this number.

33:51.899 --> 33:53.335
Look familiar?

33:53.379 --> 33:55.598
District Attorney Walsh.

33:55.642 --> 33:57.644
Same DA who said she
didn't know who Smitty was?

34:02.997 --> 34:04.303
WALSH [over speaker]:
This is ridiculous.

34:04.346 --> 34:06.087
You have no right
to treat me like a criminal.

34:06.131 --> 34:07.741
And I have a date
in two hours!

34:07.784 --> 34:08.872
[switch clicks,
turns off speaker]

34:08.916 --> 34:11.092
Thanks.

34:11.136 --> 34:13.268
I was getting
a headache.

34:13.312 --> 34:15.270
Really?

34:15.314 --> 34:17.098
This is usually
your favorite part.

34:17.142 --> 34:20.145
Getting to watch reality TV
at work, as you call it.

34:20.188 --> 34:21.363
Well, people change, Ziva.

34:21.407 --> 34:22.799
Yes.

34:22.843 --> 34:24.627
But...

34:24.671 --> 34:25.628
not that quickly.

34:27.717 --> 34:30.981
And yet, here
we have this...

34:31.025 --> 34:33.114
New Tony,

34:33.158 --> 34:35.464
who arrives early, stays late,

34:35.508 --> 34:37.205
turns down advances
from beautiful women,

34:37.249 --> 34:41.122
and has not made a single
joke in the past...

34:41.166 --> 34:43.124
What? Two days.

34:43.168 --> 34:44.473
I haven't?
Hmph!

34:44.517 --> 34:45.474
Are you sure?

34:45.518 --> 34:47.259
Hah.

34:47.302 --> 34:49.696
Well, we are in
the middle of a case.Has not stopped you before.

34:49.739 --> 34:51.393
Well, it's stopping me now!
And I'm sorry if

34:51.437 --> 34:53.308
you're losing sleep over it,
but I can't be responsible

34:53.352 --> 34:55.093
for everyone's feelings.

34:55.136 --> 34:56.268
Everyone.

34:56.311 --> 34:57.356
For example...

34:57.399 --> 34:58.792
You. And McGee.

34:58.835 --> 35:00.663
And the Brenda Bittners
of the world-- everyone!

35:05.059 --> 35:06.104
Brenda.

35:06.147 --> 35:08.497
Yeah. Bittner.

35:08.541 --> 35:10.717
The girl who posted online

35:10.760 --> 35:13.111
that we were in a "committed
relationship" last year.

35:13.154 --> 35:15.809
Yes.

35:15.852 --> 35:18.507
Yes, but if I remember
correctly, the only thing

35:18.551 --> 35:20.118
you were committed to
was a one-night stand.

35:20.161 --> 35:21.423
That's right.
Huh.

35:21.467 --> 35:24.165
[clears throat]

35:24.209 --> 35:27.603
I just found out that
she checked herself into

35:27.647 --> 35:29.257
a depression treatment
facility or something,

35:29.301 --> 35:31.172
after she wrapped her car
around a tree.

35:31.216 --> 35:32.304
Nice one, huh?

35:32.347 --> 35:34.393
And do you feel responsible?

35:34.436 --> 35:36.569
No. I mean,
I barely knew the girl.

35:36.612 --> 35:38.005
I'm just saying.

35:38.048 --> 35:39.528
Well, clearly she was
a troubled woman.

35:39.572 --> 35:41.835
That's clear now, isn't it?Mm.

35:41.878 --> 35:45.665
Still, it must be, um...
unsettling to think

35:45.708 --> 35:47.057
that you didn't
notice at the time.

35:47.101 --> 35:49.059
Especially since
your job is to help

35:49.103 --> 35:50.931
people who are in trouble.

35:50.974 --> 35:52.933
I don't know why this has
gotten under my skin like this.

35:52.976 --> 35:55.022
I mean, of all things.

35:55.065 --> 35:57.067
Maybe instead of having
a mid-life crisis,

35:57.111 --> 35:58.373
I'm having a mid-life crazy.

35:58.417 --> 36:00.375
Look, you are not crazy.

36:00.419 --> 36:02.377
Okay? You are just...

36:02.421 --> 36:04.162
growing up.

36:04.205 --> 36:08.209
And some lessons are more
painful as we grow older,

36:08.253 --> 36:09.558
when the stakes are higher.

36:09.602 --> 36:11.908
But...

36:11.952 --> 36:16.391
you need to find balance.

36:16.435 --> 36:18.219
And yes, yes, yes,

36:18.263 --> 36:20.656
yes, you need to treat people
more respectfully,

36:20.700 --> 36:24.225
especially when it comes
to matters... of the heart.

36:25.444 --> 36:29.230
But you...
need to be...

36:29.274 --> 36:32.233
who you are.

36:32.277 --> 36:35.845
Who am I?

36:35.889 --> 36:39.980
You are...
Tony DiNozzo,

36:40.023 --> 36:42.722
the class clown.

36:45.377 --> 36:47.030
That is why we love you.

36:48.206 --> 36:50.338
[door opens]

36:56.953 --> 36:58.303
[switch clicks,
speaker crackles on]

36:58.346 --> 36:59.608
WALSH:
I'm going to have your badge.

36:59.652 --> 37:01.349
GIBBS:
You lied to me.

37:01.393 --> 37:03.786
You withheld crucial
information.Look who's talking.

37:03.830 --> 37:05.875
Said you didn't know
our prime suspect.

37:05.919 --> 37:08.878
His cell phone
sure knows you.

37:08.922 --> 37:11.011
In the last month alone,

37:11.054 --> 37:12.926
there's half a dozen
calls there from you.

37:12.969 --> 37:14.362
And you knew about
his prison visits.
Okay.

37:14.406 --> 37:15.798
Look, I had a good reason.

37:15.842 --> 37:17.235
What? To destroy
your own case?

37:17.278 --> 37:18.975
No, no!

37:19.019 --> 37:21.282
I withheld my relationship
with Smitty to protect my case.

37:21.326 --> 37:22.718
Your relationship?!

37:22.762 --> 37:25.330
Look... Smitty was an
informant for my office,

37:25.373 --> 37:27.897
and then things
got a little...

37:27.941 --> 37:28.985
complicated.

37:29.029 --> 37:30.509
What?

37:30.552 --> 37:31.858
He's a good-looking guy.

37:35.731 --> 37:37.733
If the killer's
defense team found out

37:37.777 --> 37:39.735
that I was sleeping with the
subject of the investigation,

37:39.779 --> 37:41.171
they could argue that

37:41.215 --> 37:43.304
the entire chain of evidence
had been tainted.

37:43.348 --> 37:45.045
My case would be over.

37:45.088 --> 37:46.699
Maybe.

37:49.354 --> 37:50.833
Maybe if you had said
something earlier...

37:50.877 --> 37:54.272
Please, please, you do not
have to tell the judge.

37:54.315 --> 37:56.883
Yeah, actually, I do.

37:58.450 --> 38:00.408
McGEE:
It's unbelievable, isn't it?

38:00.452 --> 38:02.410
After all this,
the killer could still walk.

38:02.454 --> 38:04.499
We'll know as soon as
the hearing's over.

38:04.543 --> 38:07.197
Listen... Tony...

38:07.241 --> 38:09.330
Not you, too.

38:09.374 --> 38:10.940
Ziva talk to you already?

38:10.984 --> 38:13.595
And?

38:13.639 --> 38:16.685
And I think the hearing's over.

38:17.947 --> 38:19.079
Doesn't look good.

38:19.122 --> 38:20.689
How bad?

38:20.733 --> 38:23.475
ZIVA:
The judge threw the case out.

38:23.518 --> 38:25.303
The interim DA is
looking at his options,

38:25.346 --> 38:26.391
but as of now...

38:26.434 --> 38:28.349
Hayes walks.

38:28.393 --> 38:30.960
Plus, we never even got to find
out who was threatening Jerry.

38:31.004 --> 38:32.571
How'd the victim's
brother take it?

38:32.614 --> 38:34.486
He wasn't there.
Really?

38:34.529 --> 38:36.749
Trial notes says he's been
to every single hearing.

38:36.792 --> 38:38.751
Yeah, I read that one, too.

38:40.753 --> 38:42.320
[holiday music playing,
Santa ringing bell]

38:42.363 --> 38:44.844
SANTA:
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!

38:55.811 --> 38:58.031
There you go.Merry Christmas.

38:58.074 --> 38:59.380
SANTA: Thank you.
Merry Christmas.

39:02.992 --> 39:04.777
SANTA:
Ho, ho, ho!

39:04.820 --> 39:06.822
Move. The alley.

39:12.828 --> 39:15.004
You have anything to say to me?

39:15.048 --> 39:17.616
They know what you did.

39:17.659 --> 39:19.269
Excuse me?

39:19.313 --> 39:20.880
You hired the guy

39:20.923 --> 39:22.272
to try to stop my trial.

39:22.316 --> 39:23.578
They know what you did.

39:23.622 --> 39:25.493
We found the wire transfer
you used to pay him.

39:25.537 --> 39:28.322
TONY: You wanted to scare
Jerry out of testifying.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.802
We just don't know why.

39:29.845 --> 39:31.717
Why don't you put the gun
down and explain it to us?

39:31.760 --> 39:34.415
No. He has to pay
for what he did.

39:34.459 --> 39:35.851
GIBBS:
He was about to.

39:35.895 --> 39:37.810
The DA was asking
for the death penalty.

39:40.073 --> 39:42.380
Do you know how long
the average convicted killer

39:42.423 --> 39:45.034
spends on death row
before being executed?

39:45.078 --> 39:48.734
13 years.
Assuming it happens at all.

39:50.518 --> 39:52.564
That just wasn't
going to cut it.

39:52.607 --> 39:54.653
McGEE: So you tried to get
Hayes out onto the streets,

39:54.696 --> 39:56.132
where you could get payback.

39:56.176 --> 39:57.482
Where I'm going
to get payback.

39:57.525 --> 39:58.918
GIBBS:
Matt...

39:58.961 --> 40:01.399
it's not worth
throwing your life away.

40:01.442 --> 40:03.575
And what about my sister's life?

40:03.618 --> 40:04.924
She was the only
family I had left.

40:09.015 --> 40:10.146
And you took her.

40:11.844 --> 40:14.150
I can't give you her life back.

40:14.194 --> 40:17.415
Okay? But maybe I can
give you yours.

40:17.458 --> 40:19.808
Well, Merry Christmas to me.

40:19.852 --> 40:21.375
Look, I'd supply the bullets
myself, if I thought

40:21.419 --> 40:23.116
killing me would make you
feel better, but it won't.

40:23.159 --> 40:25.118
You don't know
anything about me.

40:25.161 --> 40:26.946
I've spent more time
thinking about you

40:26.989 --> 40:29.296
than I have anything
else in my entire life.

40:29.339 --> 40:31.472
And I'm clean now,

40:31.516 --> 40:32.865
and I barely remember
what I did,

40:32.908 --> 40:34.040
but I understand it now.

40:34.083 --> 40:37.260
I took your sister's life.

40:37.304 --> 40:39.219
I wasted mine.

40:39.262 --> 40:41.439
Are you really going to
let me destroy yours as well?

40:42.962 --> 40:44.790
Put the gun down.

40:44.833 --> 40:47.357
And what, he just goes free?

40:49.359 --> 40:51.884
Look, it's just a matter
of time before the new DA

40:51.927 --> 40:53.538
refiles the charges and
I'm back in court again.

40:55.191 --> 40:56.845
And you know what?

40:56.889 --> 40:59.108
I'll just save everyone the
trouble and I'll plead guilty.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.069
Hell, I'll even sign
the confession right now...

41:05.288 --> 41:08.161
...and maybe we can
just... pretend that
this never happened.

41:10.642 --> 41:11.860
We may have to settle for

41:11.904 --> 41:13.601
pretending someof
it never happened.

41:13.645 --> 41:15.124
I can talk to the DA.

41:29.356 --> 41:30.966
I miss her so much.

41:41.063 --> 41:42.978
Another dream
about work, McGee?

41:43.022 --> 41:44.806
Please tell me
I was not in it.

41:44.850 --> 41:46.199
You weren't,
but your knives were.

41:46.242 --> 41:47.592
What do you think
that means?

41:47.635 --> 41:49.289
Well, I do not
want to speculate.

41:50.377 --> 41:53.032
[sniffling]

41:53.075 --> 41:54.468
Palmer, what's wrong?

41:55.643 --> 41:57.297
JIMMY:
Jerry.

41:57.340 --> 41:59.255
McGEE: Oh....because you really
saved my life...

41:59.299 --> 42:00.909
Told Palmer not to
talk to him.

42:02.476 --> 42:04.826
Why is Jerry still here?

42:04.870 --> 42:06.045
He wanted to
thank Gibbs personally.

42:08.917 --> 42:10.179
So, uh...

42:10.223 --> 42:13.443
Gibbs tell the DA, yet,
about Matthew Gray?

42:13.487 --> 42:16.229
Yeah. He's willing to drop
the witness intimidation charge

42:16.272 --> 42:18.144
if Gray pleads guilty
to the weapons charge.

42:18.187 --> 42:19.624
He won't do any time.

42:21.626 --> 42:25.543
Looks like you're going to have
to have another talk with him.

42:25.586 --> 42:26.848
Mm-hmm.

42:31.374 --> 42:33.246
[sighs]

42:37.293 --> 42:39.905
[explosive popping,
people screaming]

42:41.515 --> 42:45.954
[jaunty holiday music playing]

42:45.998 --> 42:47.042
[explosive popping stops]

42:47.086 --> 42:49.610
[holiday music continues]

42:55.181 --> 42:57.052
You.

42:59.925 --> 43:02.188
Too much?
