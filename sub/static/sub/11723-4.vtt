<i>Previously on</i>
Penny Dreadful...

00:08.832 --> 00:09.862
Do you believe me?

00:10.027 --> 00:11.615
What are you asking
me to believe?

00:11.640 --> 00:13.367
<i>That you were
hunted by vampires?</i>

00:13.429 --> 00:15.147
That you commune
with Satan?

00:15.172 --> 00:17.014
I've lost the immortal
part of myself.

00:17.039 --> 00:19.445
No matter how far you have
walked from God,

00:19.470 --> 00:21.411
He is still waiting ahead.

00:21.665 --> 00:23.219
Vanessa:
Where is your master?

00:23.410 --> 00:25.609
Soon you'll meet him again.

00:25.634 --> 00:26.219
Again?

00:26.370 --> 00:27.770
Don't you remember, my lady?

00:27.783 --> 00:28.929
When was this?

00:28.999 --> 00:30.742
In the white room.

00:30.767 --> 00:31.787
Why do you think
he was talking

00:31.812 --> 00:32.892
about the Banning Clinic?

00:32.917 --> 00:35.336
This has to be the room where
I met the Master in the past!

00:35.449 --> 00:36.590
I know what I'm asking.

00:36.630 --> 00:37.660
I don't think you do.

00:37.685 --> 00:40.344
<i>Hypnotism can be
extremely traumatic.</i>

00:40.387 --> 00:41.427
Are you alone?

00:41.452 --> 00:43.195
- Always.
- No one comes in?

00:43.220 --> 00:45.402
An orderly with the food.

00:52.885 --> 00:54.285
I've brought your food,
Miss Ives.

02:26.593 --> 02:28.364
Dr. Seward:
Tell me about him.

02:28.365 --> 02:29.465
The orderly?

02:29.466 --> 02:30.866
Yes.

02:35.553 --> 02:36.953
We barely spoke.

02:37.616 --> 02:39.598
When you did,
what did you talk about?

02:41.050 --> 02:42.450
I don't remember.

02:42.735 --> 02:44.135
Nothing.

02:45.689 --> 02:47.591
How long were you
in that room?

02:49.280 --> 02:50.680
Five months.

02:54.443 --> 02:55.513
And he was the only person

02:55.538 --> 02:58.381
who came into your room
all that time?

02:58.390 --> 02:59.790
Yes.

03:03.351 --> 03:05.264
Describe him,
the orderly.

03:06.579 --> 03:07.979
Nondescript.

03:09.572 --> 03:11.183
Look at his face now.

03:11.595 --> 03:14.508
Let your eyes move over it.
What do you see?

03:16.071 --> 03:18.198
Round sort of face.

03:19.706 --> 03:21.106
Pleasant.

03:22.507 --> 03:23.907
- Good complexion.
- Eyes?

03:24.650 --> 03:26.411
Blue.

03:26.412 --> 03:28.524
Go on. What else?

03:29.406 --> 03:31.368
Let your eyes move.

03:31.393 --> 03:32.793
He's tall.

03:34.231 --> 03:37.675
Strong hands
without veins or age to them.

03:39.657 --> 03:41.619
Very closely cropped hair.

04:05.156 --> 04:06.556
Food, Miss Ives.

05:40.806 --> 05:42.618
Creature:
You have to eat, Miss.

05:45.802 --> 05:47.202
Please eat.

06:03.408 --> 06:04.808
Why didn't you eat?

06:08.738 --> 06:09.869
Why are you here?

06:09.870 --> 06:11.751
What... Why can I see you?

06:11.752 --> 06:13.823
Your mind is between
both worlds now.

06:13.824 --> 06:16.430
You're in my office,
and here in the cell.

06:16.455 --> 06:17.855
Why didn't you eat?

06:18.730 --> 06:19.870
I wanted to die.

06:19.871 --> 06:21.712
You were trying
to starve yourself?

06:21.713 --> 06:23.645
- Yes.
- Why did you want to die?

06:24.387 --> 06:26.047
I had betrayed
my friend Mina.

06:26.072 --> 06:27.472
I was ill.

06:30.794 --> 06:32.194
No,

06:32.846 --> 06:34.628
I was evil.

06:34.653 --> 06:37.445
Satan had touched me.

06:37.661 --> 06:39.061
- And...
- Yes?

06:39.854 --> 06:41.305
There was another.

06:41.330 --> 06:42.872
- Another demon? Who?
- Yes.

06:43.155 --> 06:45.187
- I don't remember.
- Try.

06:55.593 --> 06:56.993
If you don't eat...

06:58.766 --> 07:00.166
there'll be consequences.

09:37.506 --> 09:38.906
Bring it to me.

09:39.437 --> 09:40.837
No.

09:44.006 --> 09:45.406
It's three feet away.

09:48.010 --> 09:49.410
I'm tired.

09:49.972 --> 09:51.924
They tortured me today.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.926
I'm not to engage
in conversation, Miss.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.327
Are they listening?

09:57.000 --> 09:58.400
No.

10:01.670 --> 10:03.026
They didn't torture you.

10:03.027 --> 10:04.342
You weren't there!

10:04.423 --> 10:05.823
They're making you well.

10:08.163 --> 10:09.974
Bring me the food.

10:09.975 --> 10:11.375
No.

10:11.594 --> 10:13.526
How are they making me well?

10:14.160 --> 10:16.161
The injections never end.

10:16.162 --> 10:18.095
And the questions.

10:21.018 --> 10:23.040
You're to begin
other treatments tomorrow.

10:26.134 --> 10:27.916
What are they?

10:35.830 --> 10:37.671
Bring me the food.

10:37.696 --> 10:39.096
No.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.962
Is it day or night?

10:43.194 --> 10:44.447
Sorry?

10:44.565 --> 10:46.696
The light's never off
and there's no window!

10:46.853 --> 10:48.714
Is it day or night?

10:48.739 --> 10:50.139
Which would you prefer
it to be?

10:53.661 --> 10:54.721
Night.

10:54.847 --> 10:56.247
Then it's night.

10:57.647 --> 10:59.047
Bring me the food.

11:00.854 --> 11:02.254
No.

11:20.502 --> 11:22.078
I'll collapse.

11:23.337 --> 11:24.737
No, you won't.

11:25.092 --> 11:26.822
Bring me the food.
Help me!

11:26.847 --> 11:28.247
No.

11:32.140 --> 11:34.062
You think I'm a spoiled bitch.

11:37.477 --> 11:39.580
We're not to engage
in conversation, Miss.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.724
What's the treatment tomorrow?

11:49.836 --> 11:51.749
They call it hydrotherapy.

13:15.268 --> 13:16.668
I need the blanket.

13:17.371 --> 13:19.133
What?

13:19.261 --> 13:21.103
Hand me the blanket, Miss.

13:21.690 --> 13:23.090
Why?

13:25.182 --> 13:27.074
You're not supposed
to have it.

13:29.087 --> 13:30.919
Hand me the blanket, Miss.

13:32.434 --> 13:33.834
No.

13:34.246 --> 13:36.207
- Miss.
- I'll die.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.080
You won't.
No one does.

13:38.105 --> 13:39.967
Why can't I have the blanket?

13:42.139 --> 13:43.239
You're not supposed
to have it

13:43.240 --> 13:44.311
in case you hang yourself.

13:44.312 --> 13:45.362
Please.

13:45.363 --> 13:47.125
I'm sorry, Miss.

13:50.947 --> 13:52.347
You're not sorry.

13:52.873 --> 13:54.273
Not at all.

15:11.028 --> 15:13.121
How long do I...
have to wear this?

15:14.059 --> 15:16.110
Until Dr. Banning decides.

15:16.392 --> 15:17.792
Decides what?

15:18.470 --> 15:20.282
If you're dangerous.

15:21.063 --> 15:22.975
I am.

15:24.222 --> 15:26.174
Don't you think
I'm dangerous?

15:27.075 --> 15:29.206
- I think you're ill.
- I'm not ill!

15:29.278 --> 15:31.090
Then what are you?

15:35.176 --> 15:36.724
I'm sorry about your face.

15:38.453 --> 15:39.911
Well, we'll have
no more of that.

15:39.954 --> 15:41.354
No more of that.

15:42.547 --> 15:44.122
No fight left in me.

15:44.147 --> 15:46.229
You'd all like to see that.

15:46.254 --> 15:49.067
Yes, Miss.
Safer that way.

15:57.434 --> 15:59.356
It's not torture
what they're doing.

15:59.357 --> 16:00.757
It's science.

16:01.979 --> 16:03.109
It's meant to
make you better.

16:03.243 --> 16:05.335
It's meant to
make me normal.

16:05.524 --> 16:07.456
Like all the other women
you know.

16:08.007 --> 16:10.108
Compliant, obedient.

16:10.133 --> 16:12.986
A cog in an intricate
social machine...

16:13.011 --> 16:14.411
and no more.

16:14.926 --> 16:16.326
I couldn't say, Miss.

16:16.418 --> 16:17.818
Couldn't you?

16:18.919 --> 16:20.387
Not all the women
I know are cogs.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.522
Then they're freaks.

16:22.523 --> 16:25.407
My wife's not a freak
and she's not a cog.

16:25.913 --> 16:27.995
You should think
better of your sex.

16:32.479 --> 16:34.431
God has forgotten me here.

16:35.634 --> 16:38.518
He can't find me here.

16:39.083 --> 16:40.153
That's not true.

16:40.178 --> 16:42.149
I'm not Vanessa Ives here.

16:42.486 --> 16:43.886
I am no one.

16:44.341 --> 16:47.314
I have no name,
no purpose.

16:48.185 --> 16:49.305
Do you want a purpose?

16:49.501 --> 16:51.423
Don't you?

16:51.487 --> 16:52.887
I'm doing it.

17:09.507 --> 17:10.906
Is it day or night?

17:12.441 --> 17:14.502
Which do you prefer now?

17:14.502 --> 17:15.903
Day.

17:17.148 --> 17:18.549
Then it's day.

17:26.577 --> 17:28.499
What's your name?

17:30.642 --> 17:32.534
Against regulations, Miss.

17:33.916 --> 17:35.316
You know my name.

17:35.941 --> 17:37.606
You just told me
you don't have a name.

17:38.651 --> 17:41.573
Oh, I was being poetic.

17:41.574 --> 17:42.974
Oh.

17:43.656 --> 17:45.549
Don't you like poetry?

17:46.520 --> 17:47.920
Uh, no.

17:48.642 --> 17:51.516
All the men I grew up with
liked poetry.

17:53.183 --> 17:54.583
I don't.

17:55.560 --> 17:56.960
What do you like?

17:59.415 --> 18:01.287
Not being attacked at work.

18:11.377 --> 18:13.259
You must get better, Miss.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.514
They don't get easier,
the treatments.

18:18.663 --> 18:20.595
What do you mean?

18:23.122 --> 18:25.023
They get worse.

18:25.313 --> 18:26.713
How?

18:31.355 --> 18:32.755
Just get better, eh?

18:37.292 --> 18:38.692
If I'm not truly ill,

18:38.730 --> 18:40.682
then how can I get better?

18:41.502 --> 18:43.583
If you're not ill,
then what are you?

18:43.678 --> 18:45.630
You wouldn't believe me.

18:45.655 --> 18:48.578
Dr. Banning doesn't.
My parents don't.

18:50.447 --> 18:51.847
And why should they?

18:55.288 --> 18:57.280
I have been touched...

18:58.248 --> 18:59.648
by Satan.

19:01.123 --> 19:03.044
My weakness allowed it.

19:03.372 --> 19:04.961
My faith was
not strong enough

19:04.986 --> 19:06.868
and Lucifer came to me.

19:07.713 --> 19:09.735
I didn't fight him
strongly enough.

19:11.341 --> 19:13.324
I don't know that
I fought him at all.

19:31.563 --> 19:34.376
I did this for my son
when he was a baby.

19:36.427 --> 19:37.888
He's eight now.

19:40.268 --> 19:41.668
He's not well.

19:42.481 --> 19:43.881
Cough, he has.

19:46.758 --> 19:49.550
We used a metal spoon at first
but it hurt his mouth

19:49.551 --> 19:50.951
so we switched
to a wooden one.

19:51.774 --> 19:54.617
I'm surprised they have
wooden spoons here.

19:55.678 --> 19:56.708
Oh.

19:56.709 --> 19:58.611
I brought this one
from home.

20:04.849 --> 20:06.751
What's your son's name?

20:08.853 --> 20:10.528
Um, that's...

20:10.553 --> 20:12.666
Against regulations.

20:13.352 --> 20:14.752
Yes, Miss.

20:22.829 --> 20:24.661
You must get better.

20:26.704 --> 20:27.874
Please.

20:36.705 --> 20:38.728
And I do believe
what you say about Lucifer.

20:39.614 --> 20:42.642
After all... I was there.

20:47.336 --> 20:48.406
Oh, my dear.

20:48.689 --> 20:51.712
We have so much to
catch up on, do we not?

21:02.875 --> 21:04.666
Dr. Seward:
What did you see?

21:05.829 --> 21:07.910
His eyes...
The eyes of the Demon.

21:07.911 --> 21:09.935
- Lucifer?
- Yes.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.121
It was the orderly.

21:11.320 --> 21:13.221
And not!

21:13.246 --> 21:15.450
You're manifesting Lucifer
through the orderly.

21:15.475 --> 21:16.875
The only person you saw.

21:17.497 --> 21:18.873
Were there more episodes
like this?

21:18.874 --> 21:20.356
- I don't remember.
- Try.

21:20.381 --> 21:21.800
- I am!
- Try harder!

21:21.825 --> 21:24.255
Stop this!
Take me out of this state!

21:24.280 --> 21:25.311
I can't.

21:26.391 --> 21:28.944
Doctor Seward,
stop this session now!

21:28.969 --> 21:31.114
I can't, Vanessa!
I've been trying!

21:32.323 --> 21:33.403
You won't come out.

21:33.647 --> 21:34.717
You won't wake up.

21:34.742 --> 21:36.442
I burned your hand
with a cigarette.

21:36.467 --> 21:37.537
It didn't work.

21:37.845 --> 21:39.245
You've apparently
gone into

21:39.264 --> 21:41.271
something called
a fugue state.

21:41.651 --> 21:43.582
Look at me, Vanessa.

21:43.607 --> 21:45.091
I'm not going
to lie to you.

21:45.232 --> 21:47.763
There's a lot
we don't understand.

21:49.812 --> 21:51.864
It's a mental
and physical break,

21:51.889 --> 21:54.419
a disassociation with
your bodily functions,

21:54.643 --> 21:56.043
something like a coma.

21:57.055 --> 21:58.455
When will it end?

21:58.791 --> 21:59.871
I don't know.

21:59.951 --> 22:01.560
Do people die like this?

22:01.585 --> 22:02.985
Yes. But you won't.

22:03.302 --> 22:04.388
How do you know that?

22:04.413 --> 22:05.434
I just do.

22:05.459 --> 22:06.864
That's ridiculous!
You just do!

22:06.889 --> 22:08.289
I know you.

22:08.438 --> 22:11.062
And from what you say,
I've known you a long time.

22:14.371 --> 22:16.272
My ancestor,
the old woman,

22:16.297 --> 22:17.697
Joan Clayton,

22:17.897 --> 22:19.789
what would
she say to you?

22:27.993 --> 22:29.755
"Be true."

22:31.978 --> 22:33.378
Be true.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.570
You will come out of it.

22:35.817 --> 22:37.830
When you're at the heart
of your trauma,

22:38.885 --> 22:40.877
when you've found
what you're here for.

22:42.428 --> 22:44.611
I'm not leaving you
for anything in this world.

22:49.978 --> 22:51.378
What do I do?

22:54.842 --> 22:56.683
Keep going.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.108
What happened next?

22:59.523 --> 23:01.937
I don't remember.
I was drugged.

23:01.962 --> 23:03.854
What do you see?

23:05.850 --> 23:07.250
The same room.

23:07.979 --> 23:09.390
Nothing changed.

23:10.203 --> 23:11.934
The treatments continued.

23:12.935 --> 23:14.335
Escalated.

23:15.138 --> 23:16.867
I can't move my arms.

23:17.858 --> 23:19.258
I can't speak.

23:29.774 --> 23:31.596
Miss Ives?

23:33.819 --> 23:35.691
Can you hear me?

24:47.356 --> 24:49.268
I'm not good at this.

24:50.415 --> 24:52.338
My wife's got short hair...

24:52.897 --> 24:54.729
and I have no sisters.

24:58.882 --> 25:00.754
I'm sick to see you
like this.

25:02.314 --> 25:03.789
I can't stop
thinking about it.

25:07.697 --> 25:09.097
It is torture.

25:14.806 --> 25:17.062
I'll have to undo
it all before morning.

25:19.090 --> 25:20.150
They can't know.

25:20.151 --> 25:21.993
They'd sack me
if they knew.

25:22.803 --> 25:24.203
And then who'd
attend to you?

25:26.030 --> 25:27.892
It'll be our secret, eh?

25:44.136 --> 25:46.029
Uh, this is my wife's.

25:46.691 --> 25:48.613
She told me what to do.

25:50.587 --> 25:51.987
I tell her about you.

25:52.708 --> 25:53.908
That's against
regulations too.

25:57.398 --> 25:59.235
She said to use
a light hand

25:59.236 --> 26:01.198
and spare the heavy
for the lips.

26:13.801 --> 26:15.813
She's got beautiful lips,
my wife.

26:19.730 --> 26:21.130
Her name's Marjorie.

26:33.859 --> 26:35.951
I would leave this place,
but I need the work.

26:37.564 --> 26:39.576
Jobs are scarce and...

26:39.601 --> 26:41.563
I've to feed the family,
you understand.

26:44.267 --> 26:46.290
And I wouldn't leave you
in any case.

26:47.584 --> 26:48.984
Not until you're better.

26:50.206 --> 26:52.188
And maybe we'll walk out
of here together.

26:52.213 --> 26:54.045
Wouldn't that be a day?

27:41.074 --> 27:42.966
Will you take a look,
Miss Ives?

27:45.358 --> 27:47.090
Go on.

27:48.251 --> 27:49.651
Please.

28:02.669 --> 28:04.069
This is who you are.

28:05.875 --> 28:07.717
Please don't forget that.

28:19.347 --> 28:21.539
I'm really
not very good at this.

28:23.866 --> 28:25.908
Ah. It's the only one
we had.

28:26.064 --> 28:28.096
Someone gave it to us
when our son was born.

28:30.986 --> 28:32.386
"I have a little shadow

28:33.413 --> 28:35.375
that goes in and out
with me.

28:37.174 --> 28:40.137
And what can be
the use of him...

28:40.162 --> 28:42.054
is more than I can see.

28:43.625 --> 28:45.397
He is very, very like me

28:47.242 --> 28:49.204
from the heels up
to the head.

28:51.217 --> 28:53.340
And I see him
jump before me,

28:54.750 --> 28:56.419
when I jump into my bed.

29:03.467 --> 29:06.390
The funniest thing
about him..."

29:06.391 --> 29:08.393
"I never can get back
by day,

29:10.027 --> 29:14.632
nor can remember
plain and clear,

29:15.972 --> 29:18.312
the curious music
that I hear."

29:24.341 --> 29:27.146
I've got to go, before the
day fellows get here.

29:56.414 --> 29:57.814
I'm sorry.

30:00.766 --> 30:02.700
One day soon,
no one will touch you

30:02.725 --> 30:04.707
when you don't want
to be touched.

30:05.792 --> 30:08.200
Or put makeup on you,
or take it off.

30:09.523 --> 30:11.385
Ever, ever again.

30:50.380 --> 30:53.364
If I'm honest, I don't really
believe in God, but...

30:54.576 --> 30:55.976
I'll pray for you.

31:15.992 --> 31:17.392
It's Christmas today.

31:51.661 --> 31:53.473
<i>I'm so lonely.</i>

31:55.376 --> 31:56.476
Your parents?

31:56.540 --> 31:58.492
Vanessa:
They stopped coming.

32:01.169 --> 32:03.200
I'm never getting
out of here.

32:03.662 --> 32:05.464
Of course you are.

32:05.969 --> 32:09.341
What happened before is all
that will ever happen to me.

32:10.041 --> 32:11.441
Every dance...

32:12.199 --> 32:14.112
was my last dance.

32:15.181 --> 32:19.692
Every flower I smelled
was my last flower.

32:21.318 --> 32:23.140
Every kiss...

32:27.458 --> 32:29.420
I've only been
with one man.

33:46.380 --> 33:48.434
I should have died a virgin...

33:49.547 --> 33:51.379
like Joan of Arc.

33:51.937 --> 33:53.536
Be true. Be strong.

33:53.561 --> 33:55.473
Sing on the funeral pyre.

33:58.303 --> 34:00.366
Did you know she sang
as she burned?

34:01.968 --> 34:03.368
No.

34:04.058 --> 34:05.739
None of us are heroes.

34:10.110 --> 34:11.511
I suppose not.

34:21.235 --> 34:23.527
Miss Ives, if you don't show
signs of improvement,

34:24.302 --> 34:25.793
he'll turn to surgery.

34:25.946 --> 34:27.411
Let him.

34:27.436 --> 34:28.835
You don't know
what you're saying.

34:28.842 --> 34:30.862
I'll sing as he
cuts me open.

34:30.888 --> 34:32.288
Listen to me!

34:33.793 --> 34:37.400
They'll start by cutting your
hair off and shaving your head.

34:37.425 --> 34:39.407
Then they'll sedate you.

34:39.431 --> 34:41.523
Then they'll strap you
to a table.

34:41.632 --> 34:45.505
Then he'll use a drill
to open your skull.

34:45.530 --> 34:48.672
It's not a medical thing,
it's a drill for woodwork.

34:48.697 --> 34:50.739
Then he'll put
a clamp on your skull...

34:50.764 --> 34:52.576
and crack it open.

34:53.290 --> 34:55.312
And then he'll start
cutting things out.

34:56.998 --> 34:58.684
I see the results.

34:58.976 --> 35:00.676
That's where
my job starts again.

35:01.643 --> 35:04.566
You'll have lost your ability
to control your body.

35:05.083 --> 35:07.015
You'll shit and piss
on yourself

35:07.040 --> 35:08.440
and I'll clean it up.

35:08.787 --> 35:09.847
If you're lucky,

35:09.848 --> 35:11.583
that part will
come back to you.

35:11.608 --> 35:13.008
But not much else,
if I'm honest.

35:13.391 --> 35:14.441
It varies.

35:14.724 --> 35:17.697
But they are never the same
when they come out.

35:19.950 --> 35:21.941
Sometimes they can't walk.

35:21.966 --> 35:24.007
Sometimes they can't speak.

35:24.032 --> 35:27.136
Sometimes they can't
open their eyes or hear.

35:29.394 --> 35:30.524
Do you know what they are?

35:30.713 --> 35:32.485
All of them?

35:33.919 --> 35:35.583
A broken thing.

35:37.490 --> 35:38.890
Not a tiger.

35:39.195 --> 35:40.595
Not a flower.

35:40.747 --> 35:42.479
Not a clump of earth.

35:42.637 --> 35:44.911
Not even a blade of grass.

35:47.229 --> 35:50.182
Miss Ives,
you have to get better.

35:53.262 --> 35:54.662
Then pretend to be cured!

35:54.819 --> 35:56.426
Be like everyone else.

35:56.882 --> 35:58.551
Do what he wants you to do!

35:58.576 --> 35:59.976
I've tried.

36:05.503 --> 36:07.445
Is it so important?

36:07.626 --> 36:09.026
To be different?

36:10.217 --> 36:12.339
To have such
specialness?

36:12.684 --> 36:14.475
Would you want
your son to be

36:14.500 --> 36:15.900
anything but what he is?

36:17.247 --> 36:18.755
I want him to be happy.

36:18.790 --> 36:20.473
But what if he's not?

36:20.498 --> 36:22.410
Would you want
him to pretend?

36:28.367 --> 36:29.487
No.

36:29.737 --> 36:31.689
Then don't ask it of me.

36:38.170 --> 36:39.570
Let me help you.

36:45.662 --> 36:48.505
You're not ill,
so you tell me.

36:48.791 --> 36:50.191
So... what are you?

36:50.603 --> 36:52.405
I've told you.

36:53.309 --> 36:54.359
And you don't
believe in God

36:54.384 --> 36:56.336
so you don't believe
in Satan either.

36:57.622 --> 37:00.460
I'm a stupid man.

37:01.464 --> 37:03.515
Very bad at my lettering
and my figures,

37:03.789 --> 37:05.206
no gift for words.

37:05.231 --> 37:06.631
But I'm here now.

37:06.987 --> 37:08.759
And I'll listen.

37:09.864 --> 37:11.775
So.

37:11.800 --> 37:14.356
Why would the Devil
be interested in you?

37:14.381 --> 37:15.781
I don't know.

37:16.825 --> 37:17.865
If you were Lucifer,

37:17.890 --> 37:19.833
why would you be
interested in someone?

37:21.090 --> 37:22.490
Oh, that's easy.

37:24.856 --> 37:26.689
Because I love you.

37:35.188 --> 37:36.588
Where you gonna go,
Vanessa?

37:37.351 --> 37:38.751
Door's locked.

37:40.939 --> 37:44.130
No day, no night,
just perpetual twilight

37:44.169 --> 37:45.583
before they cut open
your skull

37:45.608 --> 37:47.521
and try to let
the demons out.

37:48.450 --> 37:50.041
That's where trephining
began, you know,

37:50.042 --> 37:51.442
in the Dark Ages.

37:51.974 --> 37:54.066
In an attempt to
release me

37:54.067 --> 37:57.019
and send me
into the ether.

37:57.020 --> 37:59.032
Didn't work then...

37:59.033 --> 38:00.433
won't work now.

38:01.489 --> 38:03.898
For too long
I have been afraid.

38:05.632 --> 38:07.032
No longer.

38:08.875 --> 38:10.807
I don't want you
to fear me.

38:12.707 --> 38:14.609
I want you to
embrace me.

38:15.486 --> 38:16.886
Of your own volition.

38:17.968 --> 38:19.368
Give me your name.

38:20.027 --> 38:22.960
Your favorite is Lucifer.

38:28.016 --> 38:29.958
The Fallen Angel.

38:30.794 --> 38:33.101
Defeated in that
mighty battle

38:33.102 --> 38:35.124
with your Heavenly Father.

38:36.595 --> 38:37.995
God have mercy.

38:40.351 --> 38:41.751
Has He up to now?

38:42.980 --> 38:45.442
Look at this sad old world.

38:45.644 --> 38:48.104
Children begging for
a crust of rotting food

38:48.129 --> 38:49.825
a mile from where we stand.

38:49.850 --> 38:51.027
In the shadow of this,

38:51.052 --> 38:52.452
the wealthiest city
on the globe.

38:53.263 --> 38:54.663
Look at you.

38:55.769 --> 38:57.856
Has His mercy
touched your life?

38:58.137 --> 38:59.692
My God is merciful

39:00.686 --> 39:02.767
and He will not
abandon me.

39:03.058 --> 39:04.910
He already has.

39:05.681 --> 39:08.605
You're not even
a blade of grass to Him.

39:12.008 --> 39:13.891
Let us be as we were.

39:14.806 --> 39:19.450
Before there was time,
there was thee and me.

39:19.475 --> 39:23.470
Before the scorpion crawled
and the adder hissed.

39:24.626 --> 39:27.580
Back to the time when
the Old Gods sang

39:29.021 --> 39:32.055
and there was only thee
and there was only me.

39:34.992 --> 39:36.974
Give yourself
to me freely.

39:38.269 --> 39:41.352
Be what you are
and always were.

39:41.891 --> 39:43.291
And then?

39:43.424 --> 39:46.161
We stand at the fire
as it consumes

39:46.186 --> 39:47.692
all men and all women

39:47.717 --> 39:49.578
and all the beasts
of the Earth

39:49.603 --> 39:51.665
until only we are left.

39:52.547 --> 39:54.699
And then we shall
turn our eyes heavenward.

39:54.739 --> 39:56.630
Yes.

39:56.655 --> 39:59.817
And we shall smite
the Heavenly Father

39:59.981 --> 40:02.763
from his bloody throne.

40:48.117 --> 40:50.122
I've long dreamt
of this moment,

40:50.244 --> 40:52.723
to stand at your side,
close enough to touch,

40:53.063 --> 40:54.637
to smell, to feel.

40:54.743 --> 40:56.255
Give me your name.

40:56.457 --> 40:58.200
You can read it on my tomb.

40:58.436 --> 40:59.836
Who are you?

41:00.013 --> 41:01.833
Who do you want me to be?

41:02.207 --> 41:03.607
Call him what he is.

41:04.926 --> 41:06.799
The Father of Beasts,

41:07.360 --> 41:09.551
king of the
maggot-crawling flesh.

41:12.395 --> 41:14.388
So long it's been, brother.

41:15.032 --> 41:16.874
Not long enough, brother.

41:17.562 --> 41:19.784
And your existence in
the dark netherworld?

41:20.216 --> 41:23.109
And yours
on this filthy earth?

41:24.090 --> 41:25.676
Perpetual.

41:25.775 --> 41:27.887
And the
eating of flesh,

41:27.912 --> 41:29.764
and the drinking of blood?

41:30.479 --> 41:32.614
More beast than spirit
you are.

41:33.373 --> 41:35.934
Such a need you have
of the earthly powers.

41:36.717 --> 41:38.668
And so I am made
strong and potent

41:38.693 --> 41:40.695
by the spoils of my domain.

41:40.720 --> 41:42.488
While you, anemic,

41:42.513 --> 41:44.926
feed on dust and superstition.

41:45.790 --> 41:49.279
The abject supplication of
the weak and the ignorant.

41:49.679 --> 41:52.953
If they cease to believe
in you, do you even exist?

41:55.203 --> 41:57.155
They won't believe
forever, brother.

41:58.194 --> 42:01.762
We live in a mighty age of
science and faithlessness.

42:03.286 --> 42:05.057
You're fading
to insignificance

42:05.082 --> 42:06.482
even as I look at you.

42:07.425 --> 42:09.587
I'm only concerned
with the faith of one.

42:12.675 --> 42:14.688
But you're not a thing
of the spirit, Vanessa.

42:16.345 --> 42:20.020
You are a thing of
the flesh... like me.

42:21.944 --> 42:23.344
You're the wolf.

42:24.523 --> 42:25.923
You are the scorpion.

42:27.445 --> 42:30.036
You are all those things
that slip and soar

42:30.061 --> 42:33.388
and stalk through the deep
forest and the dark night.

42:35.298 --> 42:36.698
You are powerful.

42:37.680 --> 42:39.703
You feel it coiling
within you.

42:42.296 --> 42:44.177
Become the wolf...

42:44.202 --> 42:46.315
and the bat
and the scorpion.

42:47.896 --> 42:49.818
Be truly who you are.

42:51.284 --> 42:54.377
He appeals to
your lust, your appetites.

42:54.402 --> 42:55.802
You're more than that.

42:56.543 --> 42:58.747
You're spirit and soul.

42:59.260 --> 43:01.052
You want her soul.

43:01.289 --> 43:02.689
I don't need it.

43:06.038 --> 43:07.920
Give me your flesh.

43:10.011 --> 43:11.853
Give me your blood.

43:13.116 --> 43:15.097
Be my bride.

43:15.191 --> 43:17.042
And then
all light will end

43:17.067 --> 43:18.700
and the world
will live in darkness.

43:20.303 --> 43:23.497
The very air will be
pestilence to mankind.

43:25.300 --> 43:27.402
And then our brethren,

43:27.450 --> 43:31.341
the Night Creatures,
will emerge and feed.

43:33.133 --> 43:34.995
Such is our power...

43:35.950 --> 43:38.001
such is our kingdom,

43:38.299 --> 43:40.162
such is my kiss.

43:40.922 --> 43:42.322
Yes.

43:42.903 --> 43:46.858
<i>One kiss and
you're free of all this.</i>

43:49.773 --> 43:52.775
<i>In this mortal world
you'll always be shunned</i>

43:52.800 --> 43:54.200
<i>for your uniqueness...</i>

43:55.370 --> 43:57.172
but not with me.

43:58.730 --> 44:01.403
They will lock you away
in rooms like this.

44:02.185 --> 44:04.056
They will brand you
a freak

44:04.081 --> 44:06.163
<i>and a sorceresses,
but I won't.</i>

44:07.651 --> 44:09.880
<i>I love you for
who you are, Vanessa.</i>

44:11.336 --> 44:15.380
And what name do I
whisper to you, beloved?

44:18.895 --> 44:20.295
I am the Demon.

44:22.246 --> 44:24.068
I am the Dragon.

44:25.855 --> 44:27.255
My name...

44:30.848 --> 44:32.248
is Dracula.

44:45.707 --> 44:47.650
So I see you clear now.

44:48.301 --> 44:51.153
Two brothers
fallen from grace.

44:51.325 --> 44:52.725
The spirit...

44:53.122 --> 44:54.522
and the animal.

44:54.880 --> 44:56.280
You seek my soul.

44:57.245 --> 44:58.997
You my body.

44:59.022 --> 45:01.255
But both are promised
to another.

45:01.394 --> 45:03.465
He who vanquished you.

45:03.764 --> 45:05.517
He who is my protector

45:05.542 --> 45:08.216
and who stands with me
even now.

45:09.890 --> 45:12.101
Child, you have
no sense of the terrors

45:12.126 --> 45:13.739
I will bring unto you.

45:13.764 --> 45:15.164
Then do it.

45:15.219 --> 45:19.243
And no hint of the horrors
I can unleash unto you.

45:19.369 --> 45:20.973
Unleash them.

45:20.998 --> 45:24.000
No step you take
will be safe.

45:24.269 --> 45:26.036
No dream untroubled.

45:26.061 --> 45:28.073
Battles I shall plan.

45:28.098 --> 45:30.109
Prophesies I shall unveil.

45:30.246 --> 45:32.708
Who are you to defy me?

45:33.930 --> 45:35.330
I am nothing.

45:36.153 --> 45:38.544
I am no more than
a blade of grass.

45:40.289 --> 45:42.171
But I am.

45:42.814 --> 45:44.826
You think you know evil?

45:45.670 --> 45:47.823
Here it stands.

46:37.488 --> 46:39.230
Well?

46:39.549 --> 46:41.581
Why would the Devil
be interested in you?

46:47.215 --> 46:48.615
I'm...

46:50.240 --> 46:52.807
May I sleep?
I'm very tired.

46:54.641 --> 46:56.503
Oh, yes, of course.

46:57.001 --> 46:58.401
You should sleep.

47:04.389 --> 47:06.280
I wish I could
turn the light off.

47:06.434 --> 47:07.834
What?

47:08.201 --> 47:11.024
No, don't worry.
Good night.

47:18.888 --> 47:20.288
Dr. Seward:
<i>Vanessa, look at me.</i>

47:20.923 --> 47:22.325
<i>You can come out now.</i>

47:24.096 --> 47:25.958
Come back to me
gently now.

47:26.954 --> 47:28.956
Listen to the sound
of the gramophone.

47:29.803 --> 47:31.705
The stylus cutting
into the wax.

47:32.383 --> 47:33.783
No.

47:34.106 --> 47:35.506
No.

47:36.648 --> 47:38.380
I'm not done here.

47:59.106 --> 48:00.506
Miss Ives?

48:09.184 --> 48:10.976
Will you look at me?

48:23.491 --> 48:24.891
I'm so sorry.

48:25.762 --> 48:29.547
I didn't counterfeit
normality well enough.

48:32.113 --> 48:33.513
I tried.

48:35.013 --> 48:36.413
I spoke lowly.

48:36.976 --> 48:38.376
I bent my head.

48:39.130 --> 48:42.063
I was a submissive dog.

48:42.190 --> 48:44.392
I was the woman
he wanted me to be.

48:45.378 --> 48:47.271
I almost succeeded.

48:49.416 --> 48:54.252
But then... he asked me
to speak about my faith.

48:55.199 --> 48:56.739
I told him the truth,

48:57.975 --> 49:01.038
that God's immortal
glory lives in me

49:01.063 --> 49:02.505
as in all of us.

49:05.588 --> 49:07.550
How can that be
anything but lunacy

49:07.551 --> 49:09.493
to a man like
Dr. Banning?

49:12.381 --> 49:13.781
Will you eat?

49:15.939 --> 49:17.339
Why bother?

49:18.700 --> 49:20.663
You'll need your
strength tomorrow.

49:24.700 --> 49:26.663
It's to be tomorrow?

49:30.587 --> 49:31.987
Yes.

49:33.572 --> 49:35.524
Will there be
anything left of me?

49:48.548 --> 49:50.340
Will it take long?

49:51.466 --> 49:52.866
A few hours.

49:54.421 --> 49:56.352
Will I feel pain?

49:56.377 --> 49:58.319
No, no,
you'll be sedated.

50:09.389 --> 50:11.221
Does your wife
cook for you?

50:11.869 --> 50:13.481
Yes.

50:14.077 --> 50:15.614
Yeah, she's a good cook.

50:16.699 --> 50:18.671
I'd make a horrible wife.

50:20.079 --> 50:21.479
Well, that's not true.

50:21.908 --> 50:23.833
And you're a horrible liar.

50:28.640 --> 50:30.040
I'll miss your hair.

50:30.679 --> 50:32.079
So will I.

50:33.662 --> 50:36.535
No, I mean,
I'm leaving tomorrow.

50:37.609 --> 50:39.009
What?

50:40.100 --> 50:41.500
This job.

50:41.985 --> 50:43.385
Oh.

50:45.120 --> 50:47.012
You have another?

50:48.217 --> 50:49.617
No.

50:50.041 --> 50:51.441
It's no great matter.

50:55.646 --> 50:57.488
I'll tell you
what happened.

50:59.173 --> 51:01.305
I was at home,
yesterday night past.

51:01.330 --> 51:04.243
And I was helping my son
with a wooden ship model.

51:05.842 --> 51:07.242
That's something we do.

51:08.264 --> 51:10.176
And he asked me
about the ship.

51:14.247 --> 51:15.287
I said it was
the kind of ship

51:15.312 --> 51:17.294
used for exploring
the seas.

51:18.323 --> 51:20.295
And he said, "Where do
they explore, Father?"

51:20.680 --> 51:22.671
And I told him,
"Everywhere.

51:22.696 --> 51:25.372
The Orient, Peru,

51:25.397 --> 51:27.269
and even the frozen North."

51:29.271 --> 51:30.671
And he says,

51:30.724 --> 51:32.526
"What's that, Father?"

51:33.865 --> 51:35.586
And so I told him

51:35.587 --> 51:37.658
it was the places
all covered with snow.

51:39.930 --> 51:42.043
North of Scotland
and even beyond that.

51:47.620 --> 51:49.632
And he said,
"Do people live there?"

51:53.892 --> 51:55.497
And I said, um...

51:57.808 --> 52:01.091
"No. It's too cold
and lonely all the time.

52:01.373 --> 52:02.773
No one lives there."

52:06.398 --> 52:08.271
And I started to cry.

52:10.581 --> 52:12.200
And I couldn't stop.

52:13.467 --> 52:15.418
My son took my hand.

52:15.443 --> 52:16.843
I...

52:18.315 --> 52:19.895
I couldn't stop crying.

52:21.668 --> 52:23.068
Why?

52:25.037 --> 52:26.473
Because I realized
I was wrong.

52:30.981 --> 52:32.886
One person does live there,

52:33.258 --> 52:35.311
where it's cold
and lonely all the time.

52:51.261 --> 52:54.305
So I, uh, tendered
my resignation.

52:57.390 --> 52:59.452
I'll stay on long enough
to see you tomorrow.

53:03.385 --> 53:06.469
The last person you see
before the surgery

53:08.270 --> 53:10.004
will be someone
who loves you.

53:34.199 --> 53:35.599
Good-bye, Miss Ives.

54:50.403 --> 54:52.331
I'll get you something
for that burn.

54:52.356 --> 54:53.756
Sorry.

54:59.837 --> 55:01.237
Ah.

55:01.454 --> 55:03.314
What do you remember?

55:04.336 --> 55:05.435
Everything.

55:05.436 --> 55:07.255
Images.
Like a dream, yes?

55:07.256 --> 55:09.346
- No.
- Everything.

55:14.346 --> 55:16.255
You once said
we name things

55:16.256 --> 55:17.656
so they don't frighten us.

55:20.286 --> 55:21.769
I'm not frightened.

55:24.756 --> 55:26.666
His name is Dracula.
