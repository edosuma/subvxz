00:02.769 --> 00:03.802
>> mac: A reading from the holy

00:03.804 --> 00:04.803
Bible.

00:04.805 --> 00:06.205
Genesis, chapter one.

00:06.207 --> 00:07.206
"god created the heaven and the

00:07.208 --> 00:08.207
Earth, and the earth was without

00:08.209 --> 00:09.208
Form and void, and darkness was

00:09.210 --> 00:10.209
Upon the face of the deep..."

00:10.211 --> 00:11.210
>> dennis: Hey, buddy, do we

00:11.212 --> 00:12.211
Have to be kneeling this entire

00:12.213 --> 00:13.445
Time?

00:13.447 --> 00:14.446
>> dee: Yeah, this is not

00:14.448 --> 00:15.614
Comfortable.

00:15.616 --> 00:16.482
>> I mean, it's gonna get

00:16.484 --> 00:17.549
Uncomfortable.

00:17.551 --> 00:18.517
>> yes, you need to be kneeling.

00:18.519 --> 00:19.651
It's 11:58, and mac day's about

00:19.653 --> 00:20.652
To officially start.

00:20.654 --> 00:21.653
I want there to be ceremony.

00:21.655 --> 00:22.654
>> frank: Are we gonna be in the

00:22.656 --> 00:23.655
Dark the whole time?

00:23.657 --> 00:24.656
>> my goodness, this is a lot of

00:24.658 --> 00:25.858
Complaining.

00:25.860 --> 00:26.859
Charlie, can you please remind

00:26.861 --> 00:27.860
Everyone of the rules?

00:27.862 --> 00:28.861
>> charlie: We are about to

00:28.863 --> 00:29.862
Officially begin mac day.

00:29.864 --> 00:30.863
For the entirety of this day, we

00:30.865 --> 00:31.864
Will forced to do everything mac

00:31.866 --> 00:32.865
Wants us to do.

00:32.867 --> 00:33.866
>> and if anyone is caught

00:33.868 --> 00:35.067
Complaining?

00:35.069 --> 00:36.068
>> an extra day is added to mac

00:36.070 --> 00:37.302
Day.

00:37.304 --> 00:38.303
If you cannot resist the urge to

00:38.305 --> 00:39.304
Complain, you are allowed one

00:39.306 --> 00:40.305
Scream a day to the ceremonial

00:40.307 --> 00:41.507
Screaming pillow.

00:41.509 --> 00:42.508
>> that's right.

00:42.510 --> 00:43.509
Charlie, when it was your day,

00:43.511 --> 00:44.510
Did I complain about searching

00:44.512 --> 00:45.511
For goblins for ten hours

00:45.513 --> 00:46.712
Straight?

00:46.714 --> 00:47.646
>> well, ghouls, and, no, they

00:47.648 --> 00:48.714
Didn't complain, 'cause we found

00:48.716 --> 00:49.715
Three. It was pretty sweet.

00:49.717 --> 00:50.716
>> we found none.

00:50.718 --> 00:51.717
>> yeah?

00:51.719 --> 00:52.718
>> we found no ghouls, we found

00:52.720 --> 00:53.719
No goblins, we found no

00:53.721 --> 00:54.720
Gremlins, because they don't

00:54.722 --> 00:55.721
Exist.

00:55.723 --> 00:56.922
>> well...

00:56.924 --> 00:57.923
>> guys, this whole thing was

00:57.925 --> 00:58.924
Meant to bring us closer

00:58.926 --> 00:59.925
Together, and by the end of it,

00:59.927 --> 01:00.926
You're gonna feel a little bit

01:00.928 --> 01:01.927
Closer to me, and if I've done

01:01.929 --> 01:02.928
My job right, a little bit

01:02.930 --> 01:04.163
Closer to god.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.364
>> yes.

01:05.366 --> 01:06.365
>> because I've modeled my day

01:06.367 --> 01:07.366
After the seven days of god's

01:07.368 --> 01:08.534
Creation, making my one day feel

01:08.536 --> 01:09.735
Like an entire week.

01:09.737 --> 01:10.936
>> oh!

01:10.938 --> 01:11.937
>> come on, man. Really?

01:11.939 --> 01:12.938
>> oh, come on, will you?

01:12.940 --> 01:13.939
For crying out loud, my knees

01:13.941 --> 01:15.174
Are...

01:15.176 --> 01:16.375
(overlapping chatter)

01:16.377 --> 01:17.543
>> three, two, one, begin!

01:17.545 --> 01:19.411
On the first day, god said, "let

01:19.413 --> 01:22.915
There be...

01:22.917 --> 01:25.350
Mac."

01:48.241 --> 01:49.608
>> seven straight hours of

01:49.610 --> 01:50.809
Lecturing?

01:50.811 --> 01:51.810
>> yeah, and five hours alone

01:51.812 --> 01:52.811
Dedicated to the evils of

01:52.813 --> 01:53.812
Homosexuality... From him?

01:53.814 --> 01:54.746
>> did anyone else notice that

01:54.748 --> 01:55.647
He had an erection the entire

01:55.649 --> 01:56.448
Time?

01:56.450 --> 01:57.883
>> how could you miss it?

01:57.885 --> 01:58.650
>> I mean, it was, like,

01:58.652 --> 01:59.952
>> it was right there.

01:59.954 --> 02:00.886
Shh, shh, shh-- here he comes.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.421
Introduce a new theme to the

02:02.423 --> 02:03.589
Day.

02:03.591 --> 02:04.590
So I'd like to infuse the

02:04.592 --> 02:05.591
Religious angle with the theme

02:05.593 --> 02:07.426
Of badass.

02:07.428 --> 02:08.961
And I quote once again from

02:08.963 --> 02:10.162
Genesis.

02:10.164 --> 02:11.163
"and god said, 'let there be a

02:11.165 --> 02:12.164
Firmament in the midst of the

02:12.166 --> 02:13.165
Waters, and let it divide the

02:13.167 --> 02:14.166
Waters from the waters.'

02:14.168 --> 02:15.167
And god made the firmament and

02:15.169 --> 02:16.168
Divided the waters which were

02:16.170 --> 02:17.169
Under the firmament from the

02:17.171 --> 02:18.437
Waters which were above the

02:18.439 --> 02:19.605
Firmament.

02:19.607 --> 02:20.772
And it was so."

02:20.774 --> 02:21.974
There you have it.

02:21.976 --> 02:23.175
>> there we have what?

02:23.177 --> 02:24.443
Uh, the what...?

02:24.445 --> 02:25.611
What are you saying?

02:25.613 --> 02:26.778
>> it's water.

02:26.780 --> 02:27.779
I'm saying "water," 'cause it

02:27.781 --> 02:28.780
Said water, like, eight times.

02:28.782 --> 02:29.948
So, it's water.

02:29.950 --> 02:30.983
That's what the whole thing is--

02:30.985 --> 02:32.184
Water.

02:32.186 --> 02:33.452
>> water what?

02:33.454 --> 02:34.453
>> water and badass, badass

02:34.455 --> 02:35.621
And water.

02:35.623 --> 02:36.788
>> ah.

02:36.790 --> 02:37.956
>> yes!

02:37.958 --> 02:38.991
>> we're doing a <i>project badass</i>

02:38.993 --> 02:40.192
Video over the schuylkill river.

02:40.194 --> 02:41.460
>> yes! Yes!

02:41.462 --> 02:42.628
>> ah!

02:42.630 --> 02:43.795
>> yes!

02:43.797 --> 02:44.997
>> ah.

02:44.999 --> 02:46.198
>> all right! Hey!

02:46.200 --> 02:47.199
>> do you guys hear the

02:47.201 --> 02:48.467
Motorcycle?

02:48.469 --> 02:49.468
I have another special surprise.

02:49.470 --> 02:50.469
We will be joined by my cousin

02:50.471 --> 02:51.637
All day!

02:51.639 --> 02:52.804
>> your cousin?

02:52.806 --> 02:53.805
>> yeah, my cousin from the

02:53.807 --> 02:55.007
Country.

02:55.009 --> 02:56.008
I haven't seen him in, like,

02:56.010 --> 02:57.009
Forever, but, guys, trust me.

02:57.011 --> 02:58.010
He's, like, the second biggest

02:58.012 --> 02:59.011
Badass I know, so, it's gonna

02:59.013 --> 03:00.212
Be awesome.

03:00.214 --> 03:01.213
Country mac coming to the big

03:01.215 --> 03:02.481
City.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.783
(frank groans)

03:04.785 --> 03:05.951
Country mac!

03:05.953 --> 03:07.152
>> country mac: Hey, city mac!

03:07.154 --> 03:08.353
(laughter)

03:08.355 --> 03:11.056
(both make wind-whipping sounds)

03:14.527 --> 03:16.962
(wind-whipping sounds continue)

03:21.801 --> 03:22.801
>> holy shit, there's two of

03:22.803 --> 03:24.536
Them.

03:27.073 --> 03:27.973
>> okay, I think I like this

03:27.975 --> 03:29.174
Framing.

03:29.176 --> 03:30.175
>> I don't even know what it is

03:30.177 --> 03:31.310
You want us to do.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.344
>> well, I'm gonna jump from the

03:32.346 --> 03:33.245
Strawberry mansion bridge.

03:33.247 --> 03:34.479
>> what?!

03:34.481 --> 03:35.647
>> yes!

03:35.649 --> 03:36.815
>> holy shit!

03:36.817 --> 03:37.816
>> what do you mean, from it?

03:37.818 --> 03:39.017
To the water?

03:39.019 --> 03:40.252
>> what?!

03:40.254 --> 03:41.320
>> yeah, I'm gonna jump from the

03:41.322 --> 03:42.254
Top of the bridge to the water.

03:42.256 --> 03:43.155
Okay, I need you to act like

03:43.157 --> 03:44.056
Concerned citizens, but I need

03:44.058 --> 03:44.990
This to feel real, okay, guys?

03:44.992 --> 03:45.924
So, I need you to be neutral

03:45.926 --> 03:46.858
About the jumper prior to the

03:46.860 --> 03:47.993
Jump, 'cause you don't know me.

03:47.995 --> 03:48.827
You don't know this man.

03:48.829 --> 03:49.761
But I need you to react at the

03:49.763 --> 03:50.729
Same time because I need to draw

03:50.731 --> 03:51.697
The jump in later to match your

03:51.699 --> 03:52.864
Reaction.

03:52.866 --> 03:53.732
>> you lost me there.

03:53.734 --> 03:54.600
What do you mean, "draw the

03:54.602 --> 03:55.200
Jump?"

03:55.202 --> 03:56.001
You're not jumping?

03:56.003 --> 03:57.002
>> no, I'm not gonna jump.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.003
Of course I wouldn't jump.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.004
I draw it in later because it's

03:59.006 --> 04:00.205
Like a post effect.

04:00.207 --> 04:01.206
>> well, what's badass about

04:01.208 --> 04:02.441
That?

04:02.443 --> 04:03.442
>> your reaction is badass, you

04:03.444 --> 04:04.610
Know?

04:04.612 --> 04:05.611
I want you to scream, "badass!

04:05.613 --> 04:06.612
You know, that dude is badass!

04:06.614 --> 04:07.613
I've never seen anything as

04:07.615 --> 04:08.614
Badass as that." you know?

04:08.616 --> 04:09.514
>> oh...

04:09.516 --> 04:10.682
>> but don't say my name, 'cause

04:10.684 --> 04:11.850
You don't know this man.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.018
That's why it feels real, you

04:13.020 --> 04:14.219
Know?

04:14.221 --> 04:15.220
Now, later, if you want to do,

04:15.222 --> 04:16.221
Like, a rudy-type situation

04:16.223 --> 04:17.222
Where you carry me through the

04:17.224 --> 04:18.223
Streets of philadelphia, you

04:18.225 --> 04:19.458
Know, that's cool.

04:19.460 --> 04:20.626
>> we won't.

04:20.628 --> 04:21.860
>> I can put that in the

04:21.862 --> 04:23.028
Schedule.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.229
>> it's not a post effect?

04:24.231 --> 04:25.230
>> no, that's a practical

04:25.232 --> 04:26.231
Effect, that would happen real,

04:26.233 --> 04:27.232
But only if it's organic, you

04:27.234 --> 04:28.467
Know?

04:28.469 --> 04:29.434
>> this is a goddamn mess, this

04:29.436 --> 04:30.369
Whole thing's a goddamn mess.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.370
>> I'm lost, I'm lost.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.404
You guys lost?

04:32.406 --> 04:33.538
>> you're not gonna be badass,

04:33.540 --> 04:34.439
But you're gonna...

04:34.441 --> 04:35.440
>> and we're not gonna react?

04:35.442 --> 04:36.441
>> this is all sounding a little

04:36.443 --> 04:37.376
Bit like a complaint from you

04:37.378 --> 04:38.543
Guys.

04:38.545 --> 04:39.578
>> who's complaining?!

04:39.580 --> 04:40.612
We don't know what's going on!

04:40.614 --> 04:41.613
>> we don't know you.

04:41.615 --> 04:42.614
>> (chanting): Mac! Mac! Mac!

04:42.616 --> 04:43.615
Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac!

04:43.617 --> 04:44.616
>> badass! Badass! Badass!

04:44.618 --> 04:45.617
>> all: Badass! Badass!

04:45.619 --> 04:46.652
>> all right, country mac, let's

04:46.654 --> 04:47.786
Do...

04:47.788 --> 04:48.787
Keep it going. Keep it going.

04:48.789 --> 04:49.788
>> all right.

04:49.790 --> 04:50.922
>> let's do this! Let's do this!

04:50.924 --> 04:51.990
>> badass.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.325
>> badass.

04:53.327 --> 04:55.827
(dennis screams)

04:57.897 --> 04:58.897
>> it's pretty high, it's good.

04:58.899 --> 04:59.898
It's excellent, it's gonna be

04:59.900 --> 05:00.899
Great.

05:00.901 --> 05:01.833
>> you better jump quick before

05:01.835 --> 05:02.801
Somebody tries to stop you.

05:02.803 --> 05:03.769
>> trust me, no one's gonna try

05:03.771 --> 05:04.970
And stop me.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.238
>> jump, asshole!

05:06.240 --> 05:07.139
>> yep. See, in the big city,

05:07.141 --> 05:08.106
Nobody cares whether you live or

05:08.108 --> 05:09.308
Die.

05:09.310 --> 05:10.575
>> jump, you pussy!

05:10.577 --> 05:11.743
>> all right, have a nice day.

05:11.745 --> 05:12.911
Okay, so, I'm gonna run to the

05:12.913 --> 05:14.646
End, book as fast as I can to

05:14.648 --> 05:16.581
The fence, climb up to the top,

05:16.583 --> 05:18.417
Stop, climb back down to safety.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.584
That's it.

05:19.586 --> 05:24.423
>> so, you're not gonna jump?

05:24.425 --> 05:25.424
>> I don't jump, okay?

05:25.426 --> 05:26.425
Why does everybody think I jump?

05:26.427 --> 05:27.626
Nobody jumps.

05:27.628 --> 05:28.627
Evel knievel didn't jump.

05:28.629 --> 05:29.628
Johnny knoxville doesn't jump.

05:29.630 --> 05:30.629
Okay, this is big hollywood

05:30.631 --> 05:31.830
Stuff, okay? Just stand back.

05:31.832 --> 05:32.831
I don't want you to get hurt.

05:32.833 --> 05:37.269
Let me handle it.

05:37.271 --> 05:38.270
>> oh, wow! Oh, there's a man

05:38.272 --> 05:39.271
Standing on the bridge.

05:39.273 --> 05:40.439
>> what?!

05:40.441 --> 05:41.606
>> yes, he looks like...

05:41.608 --> 05:42.808
Look at that.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.009
>> his name is mac.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.010
>> no, we don't know his name.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.278
>> we don't know it.

05:46.280 --> 05:47.446

05:47.448 --> 05:48.447

You guys.

05:49.616 --> 05:50.615
>> that's what it was-- rudy.

05:50.617 --> 05:51.616
>> we don't know what his

05:51.618 --> 05:52.617
Name is, and that's okay, but we

05:52.619 --> 05:53.518
Don't know each other. Hi.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.786
>> how are you?

05:54.788 --> 05:55.954
>> nice to meet you.

05:55.956 --> 05:56.955
>> oh, hi, hi, but it looks like

05:56.957 --> 05:58.123
He may commit suicide.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.124
>> ah!

05:59.126 --> 06:00.325
>> suicide is badass.

06:00.327 --> 06:01.727
>> no, no, no, no, rudy's not

06:01.729 --> 06:02.627
Trying to kill himself.

06:02.629 --> 06:03.462
>> we don't know his name.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.296
>> he just likes to jump,

06:04.298 --> 06:06.164
Mac is the one who's the

06:06.166 --> 06:06.898
Badass, remember that.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.400
>> no, we don't... Will you

06:08.402 --> 06:10.035
Everybody stop. Come on, guys.

06:10.037 --> 06:10.702
What are we doing?

06:10.704 --> 06:11.536
>> I don't know what we're

06:11.538 --> 06:12.838
>> we got to get on the same

06:12.840 --> 06:17.175
To get on the same page.

06:17.177 --> 06:18.810
Do it over and over and over...

06:18.812 --> 06:19.478
(water splashing)

06:19.480 --> 06:20.312
Did someone just go plop?

06:20.314 --> 06:20.912
>> looked like it.

06:20.914 --> 06:21.747
>> someone just jumped.

06:21.749 --> 06:22.981
Someone jumped.

06:22.983 --> 06:23.815
>> he jumped! That's it!

06:23.817 --> 06:24.816
He jumped, guys! He jumped!

06:24.818 --> 06:27.152
The day's over, the day's over.

06:27.154 --> 06:28.186
Country mac is gone, he's dead.

06:28.188 --> 06:29.020
Let's get out of here.

06:29.022 --> 06:29.921
>> look! Look, look, look!

06:29.923 --> 06:30.922

06:36.930 --> 06:37.929
>> oh, amazing! All right!

06:37.931 --> 06:38.864
>> how did it look?

06:38.866 --> 06:39.831
>> how'd it look? Badass!

06:39.833 --> 06:40.832
>> it looked badass, dude.

06:40.834 --> 06:41.833
I cannot believe you jumped.

06:41.835 --> 06:42.834
>> whoa!

06:42.836 --> 06:43.769
>> no, that's not really

06:43.771 --> 06:44.770
Badass, guys. That's dangerous.

06:44.772 --> 06:45.771
>> um, can we put him on our

06:45.773 --> 06:46.772
Shoulders and parade him around

06:46.774 --> 06:47.939
Like rudy?

06:47.941 --> 06:48.874
>> I'm feeling that now.

06:48.876 --> 06:49.875
I want to do that.

06:49.877 --> 06:50.876
>> I'm feeling that now.

06:50.878 --> 06:52.010
Yeah, yeah...

06:52.012 --> 06:52.878
(overlapping chatter)

06:52.880 --> 06:53.879
>> no, no, no, no, no, I don't

06:53.881 --> 06:54.913
Think that's gonna work anymore.

06:54.915 --> 06:55.881
That's not gonna fit into our

06:55.883 --> 06:56.848
Schedule, you know? I mean...

06:56.850 --> 06:57.849
>> I mean, it was your idea...

06:57.851 --> 06:58.750
(overlapping chatter)

06:58.752 --> 06:59.684
>> no, we're very full.

06:59.686 --> 07:00.519
We're very full now.

07:00.521 --> 07:01.453
This is not gonna play.

07:01.455 --> 07:02.521
We're gonna move on to day four

07:02.523 --> 07:03.622
Now.

07:03.624 --> 07:04.623
>> well, wait, wait, wait, wait.

07:04.625 --> 07:05.524
You skipped day three.

07:05.526 --> 07:06.458
>> uh, day three is when god

07:06.460 --> 07:07.459
Created trees and grass and

07:07.461 --> 07:08.693
Nature.

07:08.695 --> 07:09.628
You know, kind of a bullshit

07:09.630 --> 07:10.629
Day, so we're gonna move on to

07:10.631 --> 07:11.596
Day four where god created the

07:11.598 --> 07:15.367
Stars.

07:19.038 --> 07:20.205
>> if you look at the orion

07:20.207 --> 07:21.406
Constellation and then track

07:21.408 --> 07:22.874
Across to the big dipper, you'll

07:22.876 --> 07:25.076
See a gaseous, cloud-like area.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.144
>> (quietly): Okay, I'm gonna

07:26.146 --> 07:27.712
Need you guys to go ahead and

07:27.714 --> 07:29.281
Ignore everything that this

07:29.283 --> 07:30.982
Clown is saying.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.751
God created the stars 5,000

07:32.753 --> 07:33.752
Years ago.

07:33.754 --> 07:34.753
>> uh, who has the pillow?

07:34.755 --> 07:35.754
I need a pillow.

07:35.756 --> 07:36.755
(can clicks open)

07:36.757 --> 07:38.156
>> I think I thought of a way

07:38.158 --> 07:39.157
That we can work day three into

07:39.159 --> 07:40.225
This experience.

07:40.227 --> 07:42.060
>> no, we're on day four.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.228
And, besides, there's no trees

07:43.230 --> 07:44.629
Or herbs in the planetarium.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.897
>> but there's herb.

07:45.899 --> 07:46.898
>> hmm?

07:46.900 --> 07:48.300
>> who wants to smoke a "j"?

07:48.302 --> 07:49.901
>> oh, shit. You brought weed?

07:49.903 --> 07:51.136
>> no, no, no, we're not smoking

07:51.138 --> 07:52.237
Weed, okay?

07:52.239 --> 07:53.238
It's still illegal in the state

07:53.240 --> 07:54.239
Of pennsylvania.

07:54.241 --> 07:55.240
>> puff, puff, pass, bitches.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.241
>> yeah.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.242
>> yeah, come on, mac, shut up.

07:57.244 --> 07:58.477
I thought you were a badass.

07:58.479 --> 07:59.578
>> (sighs) there's nothing

07:59.580 --> 08:00.779
Badass about breaking the law,

08:00.781 --> 08:01.813
Charlie.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.415
>> (coughs) this is gonna make

08:03.417 --> 08:04.649
It way more fun, dude.

08:04.651 --> 08:05.784
>> this isn't about fun.

08:05.786 --> 08:08.019
It's about fearing god, okay?

08:08.021 --> 08:09.020
I'm trying to convert you guys.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.021
>> oh, my god, is that what this

08:10.023 --> 08:11.022
Is about?

08:11.024 --> 08:12.023
You're not gonna convert me in

08:12.025 --> 08:13.024
One day.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.025
I don't believe in god.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.093
>> well, you should.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.161
Because if you don't, god will

08:16.163 --> 08:18.830
Make a flood or a famine, okay?

08:18.832 --> 08:19.965
He will destroy you with

08:19.967 --> 08:21.466
Tornadoes and earthquakes and

08:21.468 --> 08:22.634
Aids.

08:22.636 --> 08:23.635
Where do you think aids came

08:23.637 --> 08:24.636
From?

08:24.638 --> 08:25.637
Uh, hello, god's gift to the

08:25.639 --> 08:26.638
Gays.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.639
>> oh...

08:27.641 --> 08:28.640
>> oh, my god.

08:28.642 --> 08:29.641
>> you're gonna ruin this high,

08:29.643 --> 08:30.642
Dude.

08:30.644 --> 08:31.643
>> mac, I think you're a little

08:31.645 --> 08:32.844
Confused there.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.013
I mean, yeah, sure, bad things

08:35.015 --> 08:36.047
Do happen.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.183
But what about sunsets?

08:38.185 --> 08:39.851
>> oh...

08:39.853 --> 08:41.119
>> french kisses.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.187
>> oh...

08:42.189 --> 08:43.288
>> the smell of rain.

08:43.290 --> 08:44.523
>> yeah.

08:44.525 --> 08:45.857
>> that's why I believe in god.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.059
>> yeah.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.661
>> not because of the things

08:49.663 --> 08:51.229
That he takes away from us but

08:51.231 --> 08:52.230
Because of the things that he

08:52.232 --> 08:53.565
Gives to us.

08:53.567 --> 08:54.566
>> oh... Dude.

08:54.568 --> 08:55.901
>> shit, dude.

08:55.903 --> 08:56.902
>> you just ripped a hole in my

08:56.904 --> 08:57.903
Mind.

08:57.905 --> 08:58.904
>> see, that's the god I l...

08:58.906 --> 08:59.905
I like that.

08:59.907 --> 09:00.805
>> I'm choosing that one.

09:00.807 --> 09:01.806
>> excuse me, who's talking back

09:01.808 --> 09:02.807
There?

09:02.809 --> 09:04.476

09:12.219 --> 09:13.051
He just said it.

09:13.053 --> 09:16.521
>> he just did it.

09:16.523 --> 09:19.691
(whirring)

09:19.693 --> 09:23.929
>> oh. What the hell?

09:23.931 --> 09:25.196
(machine bangs)

09:25.198 --> 09:27.198
>> carbs-wise, this is gonna set

09:27.200 --> 09:28.233
Me back, but I don't even give a

09:28.235 --> 09:29.234
Shit.

>> yes.

09:31.338 --> 09:32.337

Awesome.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.009
>> yes.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.411
>> yeah.

09:39.413 --> 09:40.679
>> all these years I've been

09:40.681 --> 09:43.715
Feeling like I hate karate.

And, like, I hate <i>project</i>

09:45.218 --> 09:49.888
Badass and, like... I hate god.

Not only is he, like,

10:05.872 --> 10:08.406
Rui... Ning my life...

10:08.408 --> 10:10.108
But with all this god shit that

10:10.110 --> 10:11.876
He's into...

10:11.878 --> 10:12.978
He could be ruining my

10:12.980 --> 10:14.212
Afterlife.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.381
>> yes.

10:16.383 --> 10:17.549
(mac grunts)

10:17.551 --> 10:18.550
>> I thought that one was

10:18.552 --> 10:19.551

So...

10:39.339 --> 10:40.338
Little bit off the rails back

10:40.340 --> 10:41.406
There, but I'm ready to get back

10:41.408 --> 10:42.240
On.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.241
>> dude, did you guys see the

10:43.243 --> 10:44.242
Way country mac was riding his

10:44.244 --> 10:45.243
Motorcycle?

10:45.245 --> 10:46.077
Badass, dude!

10:46.079 --> 10:47.078
>> no, it was reckless once

10:47.080 --> 10:48.079
Again.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.080
>> I thought it was awesome!

10:49.082 --> 10:49.948
>> he was like batman, just

10:49.950 --> 10:50.915
Zipping through the cars.

10:50.917 --> 10:51.916
>> he beat us here by, like, an

10:51.918 --> 10:52.751
Hour.

10:52.753 --> 10:53.752

10:53.754 --> 10:54.753
Motorcycle, man.

10:57.591 --> 10:58.423
Enough about country mac.

>> yeah.

11:00.427 --> 11:01.259
>> thank you.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.193
On the fifth day, god made fish,

11:02.195 --> 11:03.261
So we'll just skip right past

11:03.263 --> 11:04.095
That.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.096
>> yeah, we'll skip that.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.097
You're skipping a lot of days,

11:06.099 --> 11:06.931
Dude.

11:06.933 --> 11:07.932
>> well, you can't fit it all

11:07.934 --> 11:08.933
Into one day.

11:08.935 --> 11:09.768
That's preposterous.

11:09.770 --> 11:10.769
>> you're the one who came up

11:10.771 --> 11:11.970
With the structure, so... That's

11:11.972 --> 11:12.971
Preposterous.

11:12.973 --> 11:13.972
>> all right, on the sixth day,

11:13.974 --> 11:15.807
God created the beasts of the

11:15.809 --> 11:18.109
Earth and he made man in his own

11:18.111 --> 11:19.678
Image.

16:47.374 --> 16:48.940
Admit it to us right now.

16:48.942 --> 16:49.941
>> get on your knees!

16:49.943 --> 16:51.009
>> you are not a badass!

16:51.011 --> 16:52.010
>> oh, my god!

16:52.012 --> 16:53.011
>> hey, what's wrong with you,

16:53.013 --> 16:54.012
Guy?

16:54.014 --> 16:55.346
>> you got a problem?

16:55.348 --> 16:56.981
>> you got the problem, asshole.

16:56.983 --> 16:57.982
>> look out!

16:57.984 --> 16:59.150
(dee gasps)

16:59.152 --> 17:00.151
>> shit.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.619
>> you bring a knife to a fight,

17:01.621 --> 17:02.553
You better be ready to use it,

17:02.555 --> 17:04.489
You jabroni.

17:04.491 --> 17:06.224
>> just... Don't come back here,

17:06.226 --> 17:07.792
You punks.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.227
>> aw, you made him look like a

17:09.229 --> 17:10.228
Bitch!

17:10.230 --> 17:11.062
>> holy shit.

17:11.064 --> 17:11.896
>> nice... Very nice.

17:11.898 --> 17:13.364
>> oh, you are badass, dude.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.399
>> how'd you know he had a knife

17:14.401 --> 17:15.400
On him?

17:15.402 --> 17:16.834
>> I gave him an ocular patdown.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.202
Assessed the threat level.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.004
Clocked a knife in his boot.

17:20.006 --> 17:21.706
>> huh! Holy shit.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.042
(charlie whoops and chuckles)

17:24.044 --> 17:25.076
>> guys, I may have had a little

17:25.078 --> 17:26.077
Bit of an accident in my pants,

17:26.079 --> 17:27.078
So I think I got to change out

17:27.080 --> 17:28.079
Of this <i>gi.</i>

17:28.081 --> 17:29.080
>> he just gave that guy an

17:29.082 --> 17:30.081
Ocular patdown, and it actually

17:30.083 --> 17:31.082
Worked.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.083
>> it worked.

17:32.085 --> 17:33.184
>> he made a lucky guess, and he

17:33.186 --> 17:34.719
Put us all in danger.

17:34.721 --> 17:35.586
>> you made a poopy in your

17:35.588 --> 17:37.188
Did anybody else do a poopoo in

17:37.190 --> 17:37.722
Their pants?

17:37.724 --> 17:39.824
>> this is our head of security!

17:39.826 --> 17:40.825
>> I don't need to listen to

17:40.827 --> 17:41.826
This, okay?

17:41.828 --> 17:42.860
I'm gonna change out of this <i>gi</i>

17:42.862 --> 17:43.861
And then we're gonna keep going

17:43.863 --> 17:44.762
With the day, okay?

17:44.764 --> 17:45.863
I have a series of lectures that

17:45.865 --> 17:46.697
We're gonna get to.

17:46.699 --> 17:47.765
>> go get the poop out of your

17:47.767 --> 17:48.766
Pants.

17:48.768 --> 17:49.767
>> I can't wait for the

17:49.769 --> 17:50.768
Lectures.

17:50.770 --> 17:51.769
Goddamn, man.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.204
>> the guy is in complete denial

17:53.206 --> 17:54.272
About absolutely every aspect of

17:54.274 --> 17:55.273
His life.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.274
And there is nothing we can do

17:56.276 --> 17:57.275
About it.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.543
>> I say we switch him out.

17:58.545 --> 17:59.610
>> huh?

17:59.612 --> 18:00.845
>> country mac for paddy's mac.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.080
>> we send mac to the country,

18:02.082 --> 18:02.947
Bring country mac here.

18:02.949 --> 18:03.748
>> yeah, to the bar.

18:03.750 --> 18:04.682
>> that's not a bad idea.

18:04.684 --> 18:05.716
I mean, look, we'd be safer with

18:05.718 --> 18:06.717
An actual badass in the bar.

18:06.719 --> 18:07.718
>> we might actually become a

18:07.720 --> 18:08.719
Little bit more badass

18:08.721 --> 18:09.554
Ourselves.

18:09.556 --> 18:10.555
>> we would become more like

18:10.557 --> 18:11.556
Country mac, which'd be great.

18:11.558 --> 18:12.557
>> we have a lot to learn from

18:12.559 --> 18:13.391
Him.

18:13.393 --> 18:14.392
We should all get motorcycles.

18:14.394 --> 18:15.259
>> and drink much more beer.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.127
>> and smoke more weed, you

18:16.129 --> 18:17.595
>> and get in fights and do all

18:17.597 --> 18:19.030
>> can we make this happen

18:19.032 --> 18:20.598
>> let's talk to him, let's talk

18:20.600 --> 18:21.365
To him.

18:21.367 --> 18:22.533
Hey, um... Hey, country mac, can

18:22.535 --> 18:23.601
We just talk to you for one

18:23.603 --> 18:24.602
Quick second, buddy?

18:24.604 --> 18:25.603
Um, listen, we were just talking

18:25.605 --> 18:27.572
And, man, we sure would like for

18:27.574 --> 18:28.773
You to stay with us.

18:28.775 --> 18:29.974
I mean, like-like, stay with us

18:29.976 --> 18:31.075
Forever.

18:31.077 --> 18:32.310
Will you be part of our gang?

18:32.312 --> 18:33.611
>> yep.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.813
>> uh... Just "yep"?

18:35.815 --> 18:36.814
Just, like... That's it?

18:36.816 --> 18:37.815
You're not gonna give a speech

18:37.817 --> 18:38.816
Or lecture us or anything like

18:38.818 --> 18:39.817
That?

18:39.819 --> 18:40.818
>> no bossiness?

18:40.820 --> 18:41.919
>> no pontificating?

18:41.921 --> 18:44.222
>> it's not my style.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.157
I just go with the flow.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.158
Let the wind blow through my

18:47.160 --> 18:48.159
Hair.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.160
>> yeah.

18:49.162 --> 18:50.328
>> oh.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.395
(starts engine)

18:51.397 --> 18:52.930
>> oh, wow.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.398
>> I love that guy.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.934
>> aw, look at him go.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.469
>> where's he even going?

18:58.471 --> 18:59.470
>> I mean, the fact that we

18:59.472 --> 19:00.471
Don't know where he's going

19:00.473 --> 19:02.140
Makes him all the more badass.

19:02.142 --> 19:03.141
>> uh-oh. Whoops.

19:03.143 --> 19:04.142
>> whoopsie.

19:04.144 --> 19:05.143
>> he fell, huh?

19:05.145 --> 19:06.144
>> tipped over a little bit.

19:06.146 --> 19:06.978
>> ooh.

19:06.980 --> 19:07.979
>> he's probably okay, though,

19:07.981 --> 19:08.980
Right?

19:08.982 --> 19:09.981
>> well, yeah, he just... Popped

19:09.983 --> 19:10.982
Over.

19:10.984 --> 19:11.983
>> a little-little bump.

19:11.985 --> 19:13.251
He's fine. He's good, he's good,

19:13.253 --> 19:14.252
He's good, he's good.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.254
(bagpipes playing)

19:18.757 --> 19:20.024
>> country mac lived a reckless

19:20.026 --> 19:22.326
Life.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.495
He wasn't the kind of guy that

19:24.497 --> 19:27.498
Could score a point in a black

19:27.500 --> 19:29.500
Belt karate contest.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.536
And it turns out, he was totally

19:31.538 --> 19:33.171
Queer.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.840
Which, as we all know, is a sin.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.275
And that, coupled with his

19:37.277 --> 19:38.543
Radical religious beliefs, has

19:38.545 --> 19:42.146
Most likely landed him in hell,

19:42.148 --> 19:44.315
Where he will burn for all

19:44.317 --> 19:45.783
Eternity.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.518
So I will ask for a moment of

19:47.520 --> 19:49.320
Silence, in which I will beg

19:49.322 --> 19:52.123
God's forgiveness for country

19:52.125 --> 19:55.826
Mac's evil, homo ways, while

19:55.828 --> 19:57.895
Simultaneously doing a series of

19:57.897 --> 19:59.463
Karate moves that I know country

19:59.465 --> 20:04.302
Mac would've enjoyed so much.

20:04.304 --> 20:07.205
(exhaling)

20:07.207 --> 20:08.206
>> well, guys, I think the real

20:08.208 --> 20:09.207
Lesson here is that there's

20:09.209 --> 20:10.208
Nothing badass about riding a

20:10.210 --> 20:11.209
Motorcycle without a helmet.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.210
>> right.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.211
>> plus, he was drunk all the

20:13.213 --> 20:14.212
Time.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.213
>> yeah.

20:15.215 --> 20:16.214
>> you know what's badass?

20:16.216 --> 20:17.215
Being alive.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.216
>> yeah.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.550
So, uh, what do we do about this

20:19.552 --> 20:21.586
Guy?

20:22.554 --> 20:25.356
(mac exhaling)

20:25.358 --> 20:28.059
>>   <i>namaste. Namaste.</i>

20:28.061 --> 20:29.427
Okay, we will now pile into the

20:29.429 --> 20:30.995
Car, where we will go to the

20:30.997 --> 20:32.230
Countryside to leave country

20:32.232 --> 20:33.898
Mac's ashes in a place that he

20:33.900 --> 20:35.399
Loved so well.

20:35.401 --> 20:36.567
>> actually, we won't.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.169
Because it's officially frank

20:38.171 --> 20:41.405
Day, so...

20:41.407 --> 20:44.609
(toilet flushing)

20:44.611 --> 20:48.446
All right, pee country mac.
