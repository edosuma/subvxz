Let's go to Freddy's and get

I'd love to, but I'm

Monica's been riding my ass,

Fuck, Joel.

No, I'm good.
We're just in different places.

01:27.253 --> 01:29.130
You know, things happen.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.591
-I don't want to
talk about it right here.
-Sam: Fuck this.

01:31.674 --> 01:33.676
Let's go to Freddy's.
We can talk about it there.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.261
Sam, I need
to talk to you.

01:35.345 --> 01:37.931
-We were actually just about--
-Small conference room?

01:38.014 --> 01:39.098
(sighs)

01:41.768 --> 01:43.728
(whispers):
Fucking twat.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.149
Are you ready
for the Sam Plan?

01:48.233 --> 01:49.484
-Yeah...
-Okay.

01:49.567 --> 01:52.987
So, this is your
essays per hour,

01:53.071 --> 01:54.572
trending over time.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.492
And then, this is
your performance

01:57.575 --> 01:59.327
versus the other
team members. So,

01:59.410 --> 02:01.788
as you can see, you're
in the top 10 percentile.

02:01.871 --> 02:03.206
Wha...

02:04.249 --> 02:05.792
I'm in the-- I'm in the top?

02:07.669 --> 02:09.462
So, I'm not in
trouble right now?

02:09.546 --> 02:12.298
No, you've been killing it
since you became my mentee,

02:12.382 --> 02:15.885
and, like, you get a lot
of the credit for that.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.720
Okay... Great.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.889
Okay. I've got two
separate tracks for you.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.307
So one,
you stay in testing,

02:21.391 --> 02:22.684
and if you keep
these numbers up,

02:22.767 --> 02:25.144
you could be team leader
in, like, three years,

02:25.228 --> 02:28.231
or, if you're interested,
we move you into IT.

02:28.314 --> 02:29.566
It's a lateral move for now,

02:29.649 --> 02:31.693
but it does have
opportunities for growth.

02:31.776 --> 02:34.362
(echoing):
And so, assuming that you want
to be here super long-term,

02:34.445 --> 02:36.281
(fading out):
I really think that is
gonna be the place

02:36.364 --> 02:38.241
where you're going
to have the most, uh...

02:38.324 --> 02:41.578
(fades to silence)

02:41.661 --> 02:43.913
-(normal voice): Sorry, Sam?
-Hm?

02:45.123 --> 02:46.875
Um, what do you think?

02:46.958 --> 02:49.252
Oh, um...

02:49.335 --> 02:51.170
Well, Monica...

02:52.839 --> 02:55.049
I think I wanna quit. (laughs)

02:56.342 --> 02:58.428
Yeah. I quit.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.184
Thank you!

03:05.268 --> 03:07.103
-Thank you. Thank you...
-Sam: Thank you!

03:10.565 --> 03:13.067
It's gonna be so
bleak here without you.
What am I gonna do?

03:13.151 --> 03:15.069
Who am I gonna
go to lunch with?

03:15.153 --> 03:16.237
You know, Chase,

03:16.321 --> 03:19.741
who thinks dinosaurs are
super-cool at 30 years old?

03:19.824 --> 03:22.201
Or-or Lydia, whose nose pops

03:22.285 --> 03:23.995
every time she chews?

03:24.078 --> 03:25.204
Look at these
giant thumbtacks.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.414
I don't like
any of these people!

03:26.497 --> 03:27.916
They're all so
fucking boring!

03:27.999 --> 03:30.460
Joel? You may want to
keep your voice down.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.378
Joann, butt out!

03:32.462 --> 03:33.796
Sam: (laughs) Joel.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.632
It's gonna be okay.

03:35.715 --> 03:39.719
Look, this is
good, right?

03:39.802 --> 03:42.931
I gotta go to my mom's thing,
but I'm gonna text you later.

03:43.014 --> 03:45.642
Okay? I'm texting you.

be the first.
-(Sam laughs)

04:06.788 --> 04:09.499
They give you a hard time
about gettin' out of work early?

04:09.582 --> 04:12.585
-Um, no, not really.
-(sighs)

04:12.669 --> 04:15.505
-You hear anything
from Tricia?
-No.

04:15.588 --> 04:16.798
-Why?
-Oh, nothing.

04:16.881 --> 04:18.967
-I'll just shoot
her a quick text.
-Hm.

04:19.050 --> 04:21.010

-Oh.

a couple sips in there.

04:33.898 --> 04:35.650

-Hey.

04:35.733 --> 04:37.819
-Sam: Hey, Trish.
-Hey, Dad.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.821
-Hey.
-What are we just...

04:39.904 --> 04:42.407
We're just waiting.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.325
Great. Alright.

04:44.409 --> 04:47.286
-Dad just spilled
a little coffee.
-You did?

04:47.370 --> 04:50.331
-Yeah, but it's free coffee.
-On her?

04:53.251 --> 04:55.086
You got a drunk
in your family, too?

04:55.169 --> 04:56.629
(sighs)

04:56.713 --> 04:58.298
You know, I would never
really spend this much,

04:58.381 --> 05:00.717
but I've been listening to
Brené Brown "Dare to Lead,"

05:00.800 --> 05:02.593
and I feel like it--
it sends messages.

05:02.677 --> 05:05.638

05:45.678 --> 05:47.638
Uh, please.

05:47.722 --> 05:49.348
Have a homemade caramel.

05:49.432 --> 05:52.602
The wife got me
a candy thermometer
for my birthday, so.

05:52.685 --> 05:55.146
-Thanks.
-Doctor: You're welcome.

05:55.229 --> 05:57.899
So, you're all here
because of how hard

05:57.982 --> 06:00.193
Mary Jo's been working.

06:00.276 --> 06:02.153
She's really been opening up,

06:02.236 --> 06:04.363
and we think she's ready
for this next step.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.866
An honest family dialogue.

06:06.949 --> 06:08.201
So, who wants to start?

06:09.077 --> 06:12.413
(unwrapping caramel)

06:17.627 --> 06:20.213
Um, why don't we start
off with you, Ed?

06:20.296 --> 06:21.923
How do you feel being here?

06:22.006 --> 06:25.134
Well, who cares about how
I feel? I mean... (laughs)

06:25.218 --> 06:28.096
Sometimes, you have to just
put your head down and, uh,

06:28.971 --> 06:30.348
get on with things.

06:30.431 --> 06:31.724
I hear you, Ed,

06:31.808 --> 06:34.227
but if we don't share
how we're feeling,

06:34.310 --> 06:37.063
over time, that can
just fester and build.

06:37.146 --> 06:38.940
You know,
like a pressure cooker?

06:39.023 --> 06:42.610
If you open it without
releasing some of the pressure,

06:42.693 --> 06:45.404
then... boom!

06:45.488 --> 06:46.864
You know, takes practice,

06:46.948 --> 06:49.325
but if we can share just
a little bit of the load,

06:49.408 --> 06:50.785
it's gonna help,
alright?

06:50.868 --> 06:52.703
Thanks for getting
us started, Ed.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.080
Oh.

06:54.163 --> 06:55.957
I didn't know that counted.
(laughs)

06:56.040 --> 06:57.625
So, how's it for you?

06:57.708 --> 07:01.045
Being here, seeing
your mom's progress?

07:03.589 --> 07:04.841
Either of you.

07:04.924 --> 07:08.177
This will go a lot quicker
if you just pick one of us.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.888
-Okay. Um, Tricia, right?
-Tricia: Mm-hmm.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.640
She's the pretty one.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.144
Tricia:
Um... (clears throat)

07:16.227 --> 07:17.812
To be really honest with you,

07:17.895 --> 07:20.648
I don't feel much of anything.

07:20.731 --> 07:23.025
-Pretty numb.
-(Mary Jo laughs)

07:23.109 --> 07:24.277
Also, the dramatic one.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.404
-(continues laughing)
-Oh.

07:26.487 --> 07:27.572
Oh no, fine. That's good.

07:27.655 --> 07:28.990
You wanna do drama?
That's fine.

07:29.073 --> 07:30.950
Let's do drama.
I used to dread

07:31.033 --> 07:33.161
coming home from school
every single day

07:33.244 --> 07:34.704
because I never knew
what I was going to find

07:34.787 --> 07:36.330
when I walked through
those doors. Ever.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.082
Didn't know which one
you were gonna be that day.

07:38.166 --> 07:41.627
If it snows in January,
it's all my fault, right, Ed?

07:41.711 --> 07:43.004
-Well, it snows
quite a bit--
-Tricia: Of course

07:43.087 --> 07:44.714
Dad's gonna
agree with you!
He always does!

07:44.797 --> 07:46.757
-I mean... (laughs)
-Doctor: Okay, yes.

07:46.841 --> 07:49.510
yes, yes. Um, Sam,

07:49.594 --> 07:51.554
is there anything you'd like
to add to this conversation?

07:51.637 --> 07:53.931
(chewing)
Well, the caramels are...

07:54.015 --> 07:55.391
fucking delicious. (laughs)

07:55.975 --> 07:57.351
Thank you.

08:01.689 --> 08:03.357
-Sorry.
-Doctor: Mm.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.611
(chewing)

08:06.694 --> 08:07.862
Look, I'm glad she's here.

08:10.114 --> 08:11.282
And I'm glad she's working hard,

08:11.365 --> 08:13.159
but I really don't think
she's gonna change.

08:13.242 --> 08:15.203
Okay. Can you talk about
that a little more?

08:15.286 --> 08:16.871
Sam:
Yeah.

08:16.954 --> 08:18.206
She's gotten sober before,

08:18.289 --> 08:22.001
and then something happens,
and she's right back at it.

08:22.084 --> 08:23.920
Like when Holly died,
it was like she just--

08:24.003 --> 08:26.631
Sorry, I need to stop
you for one second.
Who's Holly?

08:28.341 --> 08:29.592
-Who's Holly?!
-Doctor: Yeah.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.260
Holly is our sister!

08:31.344 --> 08:34.055
-How the fuck could you
not tell him about Holly?!
-Mother? (yelling)

08:34.138 --> 08:36.224
If you think you
had a bad mother,

08:36.307 --> 08:37.850
you try having
a mother like mine!

08:37.934 --> 08:39.060
Tricia:
You cannot feel sorry
for yourself right now!

08:39.143 --> 08:40.603
Mary Jo:
You do anything, just don't--

08:40.686 --> 08:42.271
Don't-don't blame me

08:42.355 --> 08:44.440
for everything that
happens in your damn life!

08:44.524 --> 08:46.817
Alright?! Alright?!
Goddammit!

08:46.901 --> 08:48.027
Get outta here!

08:48.110 --> 08:49.779
-(door shuts)
-There you go.

08:49.862 --> 08:53.241
Did that work out like
you thought it would?

08:53.324 --> 08:54.825
-(Sam laughs)
-Okay.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.744
Ed:
You know, I, uh...

08:58.955 --> 09:02.541
I just think...
we gotta keep trying.

09:04.085 --> 09:06.212
What choice do we have?

09:08.631 --> 09:10.466
No, I just need to take
a little bit closer look

09:10.549 --> 09:12.969
-at the assessment rubric.
-(opens drawer)

09:13.052 --> 09:15.596
-Okay, let's try to look
at this one from last week.
-Okay.

09:15.680 --> 09:16.973
If you just use this--

09:17.056 --> 09:18.224
(clang, grunt)

09:18.307 --> 09:19.684
(Joel gasps, laughs)

09:19.767 --> 09:22.019
Oh my gosh, Todd,
are you okay?

09:22.103 --> 09:23.646
(drawer closes)

09:23.729 --> 09:25.856
(indistinct murmuring)

09:27.191 --> 09:30.194
What is funny about
a man falling down?

09:31.404 --> 09:33.239
Everyone,
back to work.

09:33.322 --> 09:35.449
(indistinct murmuring)

09:36.742 --> 09:38.202
-You okay?
-Yeah.

09:38.286 --> 09:39.328
(stifling laughter):
Oh good!

09:39.412 --> 09:42.957
(Sam and Joel laughing)

09:43.040 --> 09:44.458
And they were like,
"Why are you laughing?

09:44.542 --> 09:46.669
Why are you laughing?"
I was like, why are you not?

09:46.752 --> 09:48.421
-Because it's funny!
-Oh my god.

09:48.504 --> 09:50.256
See, this is why I need
you at work with me.

09:50.339 --> 09:52.842
-Yeah. (laughs)
-Are you gonna eat that bacon?

09:52.925 --> 09:55.011
Yes. Alright...

09:56.470 --> 09:59.348
-So, you're a little
shunned, you know.
-Just a little shunned.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.810
-Just a little shunned!
It's no big deal. It's like...
-(laughs)

10:05.146 --> 10:06.856
Pick one person,

10:06.939 --> 10:08.816
and be super nice to him,

10:08.899 --> 10:10.276
and everything will be okay.

10:11.736 --> 10:14.488
That could maybe work.
But, like, who?

10:14.572 --> 10:16.615
Oh god, I don't know
any of their names.

10:16.699 --> 10:18.743
(laughs)
Yeah, really.

10:18.826 --> 10:21.662
Oh, so what are you gonna do
with your first day of freedom?

10:21.746 --> 10:23.914
-Oh...
-Gonna just lay around,

10:23.998 --> 10:26.125
watching television,
drinking wine...

10:26.208 --> 10:27.835
No, I'm gonna sit down,

10:27.918 --> 10:29.837
and I'm gonna write out
my five-year plan.

10:29.920 --> 10:33.549
(laughing)

10:35.092 --> 10:37.136
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you... Really?

10:37.219 --> 10:39.513
-Really. I'm totally
fucking serious.
-Oh.

10:39.597 --> 10:42.141
-You know what the first
thing you should write on it?
-What?

10:42.224 --> 10:44.018
"Be more generous
with my bacon."

10:44.101 --> 10:46.228
-Fuck you.
-(laughs)

10:46.312 --> 10:48.814
I actually don't
care for bacon.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.816
Well then, why won't
you give it to me?

10:50.900 --> 10:52.360
I'm a complicated woman.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.695
(laughing)

10:54.779 --> 10:57.281
(wind blowing)

10:57.365 --> 11:00.242
I think if you'd consider
planting cover crops on,

11:00.326 --> 11:02.036
uh, this quarter here...

11:02.119 --> 11:04.872
I can't do it.
With all the planting now

11:04.955 --> 11:06.874
and the, the tilling
in the spring,

11:06.957 --> 11:09.418
you know, for something
I can't even sell.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.046
I hear that, but you'll
be buying less herbicide,

11:12.129 --> 11:14.090
and we can talk about
no-till options.

11:14.173 --> 11:16.759
Your yields will increase
over time and, you know,

11:16.842 --> 11:19.220
it is a good investment
in your future.

11:19.303 --> 11:20.888
It's hard to get excited
about the future

11:20.971 --> 11:22.681
when you're just sort of,

11:22.765 --> 11:24.892
you know, hanging
on to the present.

11:24.975 --> 11:27.937
-(sighs) It's just
something to think about.
-Yeah.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.147
I know we don't know
each other well, but

11:30.231 --> 11:32.066
you're a real good
steward of your land.

11:32.149 --> 11:33.484
Uh-huh.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.570
I... Thank you.

11:38.155 --> 11:40.658
(clears throat)

11:40.741 --> 11:42.868
You know, I'm sorry that
I left early yesterday,

11:42.952 --> 11:44.286
but it was a, uh,

11:44.370 --> 11:47.206
personal, you know,
family matter.

11:47.289 --> 11:50.626
It's alright.
Family first, you know?

11:50.709 --> 11:52.586
I-I'm not sure I always
put 'em first.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.297
I-I thought I was,
but I think I might have...

11:55.381 --> 11:56.465
messed up.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.592
See, I'm not the type
of fellow that can, uh,

11:58.676 --> 12:00.636
just talk about stuff,

12:00.719 --> 12:03.597
and so, I hold things in.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.100
I just...

12:06.934 --> 12:09.520
Keep things to myself.

12:09.603 --> 12:12.022
I realize that that's
all gotta change.

12:12.106 --> 12:14.733
Well, you know,
think of it this way.

12:14.817 --> 12:17.528
You can only start
from where you are.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.282
(grunt)

12:21.365 --> 12:23.909
(inhales, exhales)

12:26.662 --> 12:28.247
My wife...

12:29.290 --> 12:30.875
Mary Jo...

12:31.667 --> 12:33.919
is in one of those...

12:34.003 --> 12:35.629
rehab-type places.

12:38.132 --> 12:39.758
For the drinking.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.597
(sighs) Sorry.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.265
It's tough for both of you.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.726
It's tougher on her.

12:57.735 --> 13:00.154
It's gonna be okay.

13:00.237 --> 13:03.491
-(bright music playing)
-(Tricia humming)

13:07.369 --> 13:09.788
The Linens and Lemons Order
came in missing a few items,

13:09.872 --> 13:12.541
but I went ahead and called
and had it all sorted out.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.336
Oh, and one of the new
ginger jar lamps that came in,

13:15.419 --> 13:17.379
one of them has a short.

13:17.463 --> 13:18.881
-(door bell ringing)
-I'll take a look.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.341
Wonderful.

13:20.424 --> 13:23.260
-Hi! Good morning.
-Hi! Good morning.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.387
-My god, I love that top.
-Thank you!

13:25.471 --> 13:27.097
-Poppy's. (laughs)
-Oh!

13:27.181 --> 13:29.850
-I have a return.
-Okay, let me see this.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.478
Oh my goodness.
Is that for sale?

13:32.561 --> 13:34.021
(paper crinkling)

13:35.564 --> 13:37.024
Charity:
Oh. Um,

13:37.107 --> 13:38.817
you kn-- uh, we just got--

13:38.901 --> 13:40.486
The answer is yes!

13:40.569 --> 13:42.863
Yeah, I can-- you can
wrap that up. Like,

13:42.947 --> 13:45.449
-I'll take it.
-Okay! Let's get this rung up.

13:46.575 --> 13:49.787
-(bag crinkling)
-(birds chirping)

13:58.837 --> 14:00.422
(knocking)

14:01.632 --> 14:03.133
I dropped this chip
on the floor,

14:03.217 --> 14:06.804
so I had to go down
and get it, so I got it.

14:06.887 --> 14:09.431
Oh, okay. Um...

14:10.641 --> 14:12.768
I have some of your,
uh, your stuff.

14:12.851 --> 14:15.604
-Oh. Okay!
-Okay?

14:25.406 --> 14:26.991
I was looking for
that sweatshirt.

14:27.074 --> 14:29.118
-Oh, okay.
-(laughs)

14:30.494 --> 14:34.456
Look, I know this
is all super... hard.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.083
The timing.
Like, I had no idea
Sam was gonna quit.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.501
I wouldn't have
broken up with you--

14:37.585 --> 14:40.379
No, it's fine. It's okay.
It's no biggie.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.841
Oh, I got you,
uh, the Vitamix

14:43.924 --> 14:46.969
for Christmas. Uh...

14:47.052 --> 14:48.929
I thought,
maybe I should...

14:49.013 --> 14:50.764
uh, give it to you now.

14:52.558 --> 14:56.979
It's, uh,
it's refurbished, but...

14:57.062 --> 15:00.399
Can I open it now? Or is
that taking things too fast?

15:00.482 --> 15:02.610
-(laughs)
-Ouch. (laughs)

15:03.694 --> 15:05.279
(Joel laughs)

15:08.157 --> 15:09.283
You can...

15:09.366 --> 15:12.119
pull up a chair at our table
if you... if you want.

15:12.202 --> 15:14.371
No, I'm listening to music.

15:20.628 --> 15:23.839
Well, Merry, uh...
Christmas. (laughs)

15:26.091 --> 15:28.260
-Merry Christmas.
-(laughs)

15:31.013 --> 15:32.765
Charity:
So, Tricia, um,

15:32.848 --> 15:34.642
you know, I know this is
a little uncomfortable--

15:34.725 --> 15:36.435
You know, it is. It-it's
a little bit uncomfortable.

15:36.518 --> 15:38.937
Sure, but you know what?
We're both adults,

15:39.021 --> 15:42.066
and we have a business to run
and a fiscal responsibility--

15:42.149 --> 15:43.734
No, I think your
fiscal responsibilities

15:43.817 --> 15:46.320
are to your clients because
you're a hooker and a whore.

15:46.403 --> 15:47.529
Okay, well, insults
aren't gonna help.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.323
It's funny because
they're helping me.

15:49.406 --> 15:50.991
You realize that you were
my best friend, right?

15:51.075 --> 15:52.493
I don't have a lot of friends,

15:52.576 --> 15:55.996
so I don't understand how
someone does what you just did.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.832
I'd like for you to
leave my store, please.

15:58.916 --> 16:01.001
Okay, well, that's...
This isn't your store.

16:01.085 --> 16:04.004
-It is now.
-No, no, no, no, no.
I know you're upset,

16:04.088 --> 16:05.756
but this is my store.

16:05.839 --> 16:08.008
When Shannon was little,
you wanted

16:08.092 --> 16:09.635
to stay home, and who
went to the trade shows?

16:09.718 --> 16:12.680
-I did. And who negotiated
the lease and got it down?
-Mm-hmm.

16:12.763 --> 16:13.972
-I did that. And--
-Mm-hmm.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.266
Who slept with my husband?
You did that.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.352
-I'm gonna buy you out.
You're done.
-(knocking on door)

16:18.435 --> 16:19.895
-That's it.
-(banging)

16:19.978 --> 16:23.107
Just wait, okay?
Nobody's buying anybody out.

16:23.190 --> 16:24.608
-(door bell ringing)
-Hey, hey.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.026
Uh, not right now, Coop.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.570
Oh no, I just had a chili dog,
gonna go do a BM, okay?

16:28.654 --> 16:30.906
-Oh. Okay--
-Hey, Tricia, what up?

16:32.408 --> 16:34.076
(bathroom door opens)

16:34.159 --> 16:35.661
(door shuts)

16:35.744 --> 16:37.621
Oh my god.

16:37.705 --> 16:40.374
-He doesn't know?
-Just wait.

16:40.457 --> 16:42.084
You have nothing to
gain by telling him.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.545
-What do I have to lose?
-You don't have...

16:44.628 --> 16:47.840
He didn't do anything, okay?
Tricia, you love Coop.

16:48.924 --> 16:50.092
He would be crushed.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.927
Should you maybe have
thought about that before?

16:52.010 --> 16:53.929
-I can't believe
you're crying now.
-Just...

16:54.012 --> 16:55.681
I can't believe
you're crying now.

16:55.764 --> 16:57.057
(whispers):
He comes out of that bathroom,

16:57.141 --> 17:00.686
Charity,
I am telling him everything.

17:00.769 --> 17:02.771
Unless you agree
to be a silent partner.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.440
(toilet flushes)

17:06.483 --> 17:08.902
-That's extortion.
-(door opens)

17:08.986 --> 17:10.821
Hoo! Flag on the play,
hunners.

17:10.904 --> 17:12.489
-Give it 10 or 15 in there.
-Hey, baby!

17:12.573 --> 17:13.532
(forced laugh)

17:13.615 --> 17:15.409
-Cooper: I know.
-Hey, Coop?

17:15.492 --> 17:17.077
-Yeah, what up?
-Oh, it's nothing.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.621
Do you wanna hear
something really amazing?

17:19.705 --> 17:20.831
Yeah.

17:23.083 --> 17:25.919
It was just Tricia
was gonna tell you...

17:26.003 --> 17:28.213
that we got some cedar
closet spray,

17:28.297 --> 17:30.382
and she knows how
much you love cedar.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.676
-Oh my god, I love my cedar.
-Know it.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.219
Thanks, Tricia!

17:34.303 --> 17:36.138
-See you at home, baby.
-Coop: Yeah, you will.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.598
-(door bell rings)
-(laughs)

17:39.475 --> 17:41.769
(inhales, sighs)

17:41.852 --> 17:42.978

17:45.481 --> 17:46.565
Take it.

17:47.775 --> 17:50.027
It's all yours.

17:50.110 --> 17:51.779
(laughs) Unbelievable.

17:51.862 --> 17:55.282

22:34.811 --> 22:37.189
God. (laughs) Alright.

22:37.731 --> 22:39.066
(blows)

22:39.149 --> 22:42.402
A little titty rub
will fix it. (laughs)

22:42.486 --> 22:45.238
-(puts in CD, closes player)
-(laughs)

22:45.989 --> 22:48.241
(sighs) Hey!

22:48.325 --> 22:50.285
-Do you work here?
-Yeah.

22:50.368 --> 22:53.455
Well, where is her headstone?
We paid for it like a year ago!

22:53.538 --> 22:56.333
Listen, I've been trying to
get that mother to finalize

22:56.416 --> 22:58.085
the order
for months now.

22:58.168 --> 23:01.880
I call, I send e-mails.
She doesn't answer me.

23:01.963 --> 23:03.381
(sighs)

23:03.465 --> 23:05.801
Goddammit, Mom.

23:05.884 --> 23:08.470
(panting)

23:11.389 --> 23:13.558
You deserve more than this.

23:16.019 --> 23:18.146
You deserve more than this.

23:19.439 --> 23:20.524
(sighs)

23:23.610 --> 23:25.487
I'm so sorry.

23:25.570 --> 23:27.697
I'm so fucking sorry.

23:32.494 --> 23:33.620
Sam:
Alright, come on.

23:33.703 --> 23:34.955
Grab your shit,

23:35.038 --> 23:36.706
and let's go.

23:36.790 --> 23:38.834
You being here is
a waste of time and money.

23:38.917 --> 23:42.003
What do you care? You only
come home to dump me in here.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.381
Oh my god, Mom, if you
don't even wanna try, fine!

23:44.464 --> 23:45.757
But you're not gonna
lay around here

23:45.841 --> 23:47.676
eating cookies
and hemorrhaging cash,

23:47.759 --> 23:49.803
while Dad is at home,
falling apart.

23:49.886 --> 23:51.638
-I am trying.
-(slams drawer)

23:51.721 --> 23:52.973
Really?! Really?!

23:53.056 --> 23:56.309
You didn't even tell Doctor
What's-His-Face about Holly!

23:57.435 --> 24:00.063
You can't just erase her, Mom!

24:00.147 --> 24:01.648
You haven't paid
for her headstone,

24:01.731 --> 24:04.151
and now, she's out there,
alone in a cemetery,

24:04.234 --> 24:06.194
under a fucking plastic
peg in the ground!

24:06.278 --> 24:08.530
I can't talk about her.
It's too hard!

24:08.613 --> 24:10.240
I know it's hard!

24:11.449 --> 24:13.451
It's hard for all of us!

24:13.535 --> 24:14.661
(Mary Jo sniffles)

24:15.370 --> 24:16.663
I...

24:16.746 --> 24:19.916
I... All I do is sit
around here, thinking

24:20.000 --> 24:22.419
about how I-I...

24:24.212 --> 24:27.215
I-I messed up
with all you girls,

24:27.299 --> 24:29.968
with Holly, too.
I just messed up.

24:31.803 --> 24:32.888
(sighs)

24:43.481 --> 24:45.650
(sighs)

24:45.734 --> 24:47.527
You remember
when we were little
and we would be upset,

24:47.611 --> 24:50.906
and then he would sing to us,
and you'd make us feel better?
