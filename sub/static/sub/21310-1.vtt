00:57.401 --> 00:59.772
How could you let that happen?
You were supposed to short it.

00:59.872 --> 01:02.975
- I don't care what the indicators said.
- Hey, Bobby, can you bring the car around?

01:03.075 --> 01:06.578
We're gonna be ready to go
in like 10 minutes. Thank you.

01:06.678 --> 01:11.165
Well, I operate on information,
not market trends. You know that.

01:12.517 --> 01:14.587
- <i>This is Pierre.</i>
- Come on.

01:14.687 --> 01:18.157
- <i>How may I help you?</i>
- Hello, Pierre, this is Mrs. Dutchman.

01:18.257 --> 01:21.961
We're running about an hour behind so
I'm gonna need to push our reservation.

01:22.061 --> 01:24.074
- Is that all right?
- <i>Not a problem.</i>

01:24.174 --> 01:27.143
<i>Your table will be ready for you
whenever you arrive.</i>

01:31.870 --> 01:33.421
Gorgeous.

01:33.772 --> 01:37.791
- It's okay.
- Absolutely gorgeous.

01:38.576 --> 01:41.596
But... there's something missing.

01:44.216 --> 01:46.067
Close your eyes.

01:48.086 --> 01:50.088
Happy 19th, baby.

01:54.225 --> 01:55.976
Mark.

01:57.862 --> 02:01.349
- It's... it's stunning.
- Just like you.

02:16.281 --> 02:18.367
Only the best for my girl.

02:20.385 --> 02:23.055
- I love you.
- Love you.

02:23.155 --> 02:24.972
Let's go.

02:27.229 --> 02:29.473
Welcome to the Boom Boom Room.

02:31.630 --> 02:33.279
One drink and we're out.

02:33.599 --> 02:35.701
We can raise whatever you need.

02:35.801 --> 02:39.059
You believe that you Italians invented sex
whereas everyone knows...

02:39.159 --> 02:42.342
- We could have a little private party.
- ...that we Greeks did.

02:43.602 --> 02:44.744
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:44.844 --> 02:48.414
So that cryptic message on the phone,
what are we talking about?

02:48.514 --> 02:51.872
- Bronson and Jennings.
- The pharmaceutical company.

02:51.972 --> 02:54.584
It's selling at 25,
come Monday, it's half that.

02:54.684 --> 02:58.407
Their new cancer drug is shit.
It's getting squashed next week.

02:58.507 --> 03:01.392
So we short B & J?

03:01.493 --> 03:03.396
And buy up what's left with the profit.

03:03.496 --> 03:06.932
- I didn't see you at the conservancy lunch.
- I know, I'm sorry, I couldn't make it.

03:07.032 --> 03:10.903
- You know, there's an opening on the board.
- I know, but my plate is so full...

03:11.003 --> 03:14.607
...and I was thinking
that Deanna would be perfect.

03:14.707 --> 03:17.076
- I'd be honored to help out.
- We should talk.

03:17.176 --> 03:22.046
- Positiv.
- What the fuck is Positiv?

03:22.146 --> 03:25.551
The most successful female Viagra
the world has ever seen.

03:25.651 --> 03:27.669
B & J holds the patent.

03:28.920 --> 03:30.740
Now you have my attention.

03:30.840 --> 03:34.260
Ladies, you know
it's my anniversary, so I am...

03:34.360 --> 03:37.530
- Happy anniversary.
- Yes, say goodnight.

03:37.630 --> 03:39.699
Well, in that case, I'll wire the funds.

03:39.799 --> 03:42.235
- Use the...
- Yeah, yeah, the family account.

03:42.335 --> 03:44.737
I know about the family account.

03:44.837 --> 03:48.241
Family account? What are you boys plotting?

03:48.341 --> 03:50.576
Our new summer house in South Hampton.

03:50.676 --> 03:53.446
- Suzanne.
- Ladies and gentlemen.

03:53.546 --> 03:55.197
Miss Sasha Lazard.

04:09.594 --> 04:11.664
Taxi for you, Mr. Dutchman?

04:11.964 --> 04:14.415
My driver's here, thanks.

04:18.002 --> 04:19.271
How do you know my name?

04:19.370 --> 04:21.374
I've seen you on Mad Money and The Crunch.

04:21.474 --> 04:25.478
"Put your drive at the top of the list
and you become an unstoppable force."

04:25.578 --> 04:28.782
- Not bad.
- Your words really hit home with me.

04:29.682 --> 04:31.350
Keep watching, kid.

04:31.450 --> 04:35.688
Sir, any chance a hard working guy
who's ready to put the job first...

04:35.788 --> 04:38.424
...could catch a break and come work for you?

04:38.524 --> 04:40.359
Why the hell would I give you a job?

04:40.459 --> 04:43.546
How else is a guy from the outside
supposed to get in?

04:48.083 --> 04:51.690
Give my office a call tomorrow.
We'll see if we can use you.

04:52.871 --> 04:55.789
Now that is what I'm talking about.

04:56.409 --> 04:59.879
What was that business with Howard
about the family account?

04:59.979 --> 05:02.882
It's just an opportunity
that shouldn't be missed.

05:02.982 --> 05:06.619
I know, but what did it have to do
with the family account?

05:06.719 --> 05:08.821
Just tax reasons, baby.

05:08.921 --> 05:11.557
Let me worry about the business, okay?

05:11.657 --> 05:14.938
- I've done well so far, right?
- Excellent.

05:15.458 --> 05:17.463
Did I tell you who called me the other day?

05:17.563 --> 05:18.597
Who?

05:18.697 --> 05:21.180
- Aaron.
- Steele?

05:21.980 --> 05:23.502
- Your old boss, huh?
- Yes.

05:23.602 --> 05:25.037
For what?

05:25.137 --> 05:28.607
That they're looking for an executive editor
and he was wanting me to come back.

05:28.707 --> 05:32.911
For what, 120 K a year plus dental?
Why bother?

05:33.011 --> 05:36.487
Well, it's not really
about the money and it's...

05:36.587 --> 05:39.652
Baby, between India and China
and this new deal with Howard...

05:39.752 --> 05:44.273
...I need... I need all your attention
on me right now. All of it.

05:44.373 --> 05:46.407
It's too important.

05:48.493 --> 05:50.311
I love you so much.

05:53.465 --> 05:56.168
Stop wasting my time, Lewis.
I don't want to hear it.

05:56.268 --> 06:00.341
Yeah, don't call me again
until it's done. All right?

06:00.441 --> 06:03.859
We're only interested in alpha projects
with outsized returns.

06:04.209 --> 06:06.078
Stop nodding when you
don't understand something.

06:06.178 --> 06:07.646
- It's your worst tell.
- Tell?

06:07.746 --> 06:09.849
Pick up a copy of Doyle Brunsen's
Super System.

06:09.949 --> 06:12.318
Read it cover to cover by next week
or don't bother coming back.

06:12.418 --> 06:14.253
- What's it about?
- Power poker.

06:14.353 --> 06:17.056
- Got it.
- Don't say got it.

06:17.456 --> 06:21.141
Faster than I would have given you
credit for, Lewis. Let's hear it.

06:22.426 --> 06:26.231
You just earned your Hanukah bonus.
Congratulations.

06:26.331 --> 06:28.067
- You play golf?
- Not well.

06:28.167 --> 06:31.003
Learn. You only play the
Deep Dale Cub in Long Island.

06:31.103 --> 06:33.107
Why the Deep Dale Cub?

06:34.372 --> 06:37.978
You don't know something, act like
you do until you've figured it out.

06:39.578 --> 06:41.854
And what if I can't figure it out, boss?

06:41.954 --> 06:44.517
You can't figure it out,
join the fucking peace corps...

06:44.617 --> 06:46.837
...'cause that means
you're not cut out for this game.

06:54.492 --> 06:58.145
I should have my own show. Fuck Trump.

06:59.564 --> 07:01.535
Fuck me.

07:08.640 --> 07:10.676
That's a true story.

07:10.776 --> 07:12.493
Oh, hold on.

07:14.479 --> 07:17.763
My, my, my, I like this place. Indeed I do.

07:19.240 --> 07:22.745
Excuse me, I have to go
speak to my concierge.

07:22.845 --> 07:24.906
Yeah, give me that leg.

07:27.759 --> 07:30.163
Are you sure you have enough?

07:31.263 --> 07:33.906
My dear woman, I'm an aristocrat.

07:34.006 --> 07:36.280
We always have enough.

07:38.903 --> 07:41.306
You're facing real time, Howard.

07:41.406 --> 07:44.370
And believe me, we would love
to see you do that time.

07:44.470 --> 07:47.329
But there's something we'd love even more.

07:52.887 --> 07:57.389
Inhale, the right leg up. Exhale, step
the right foot in between your hands.

07:57.489 --> 08:01.293
Inhale, open up your chest. Exhale and
pop the left knee behind the right ankle...

08:01.393 --> 08:05.431
...sit down seated, final twist.
Inhale, the right hand down, the left arm up.

08:05.531 --> 08:08.200
Exhale, twist, look over your right shoulder.

08:08.300 --> 08:10.247
Suzanne Dutchman?

08:12.203 --> 08:13.546
Yes?

08:13.646 --> 08:17.124
I'm gonna need you to come with me. Let's go.

08:46.337 --> 08:48.340
What the hell is going on?

08:48.440 --> 08:52.177
This is all Howard.
We are not guilty in any way.

08:52.277 --> 08:54.756
Without his testimony, they ain't got shit.

08:56.415 --> 08:58.655
Why are they holding you without bail?

08:59.616 --> 09:01.353
You know they're saying
they're gonna charge me.

09:01.453 --> 09:04.540
No, no, no, no. The lawyers
are going to straighten this out.

09:07.091 --> 09:11.345
Listen to me. Nothing is gonna happen to you.

09:12.296 --> 09:13.881
Okay?

09:37.388 --> 09:39.525
- Is this your first time?
- Yeah.

09:39.625 --> 09:42.728
- What made you come?
- Sorry?

09:42.828 --> 09:44.763
Why did you volunteer?

09:44.863 --> 09:48.094
I wanted to do something good
for the community.

09:49.034 --> 09:52.361
When people see a blind man start to get
up, their instinct is to grab his arm.

09:52.461 --> 09:54.172
- Big mistake with Bill.
- Got it.

09:54.272 --> 09:57.476
Don't use hand signals.
Bill can still see some shapes and light...

09:57.576 --> 10:00.612
...but he won't be able to discern
any waving or pointing.

10:00.712 --> 10:02.596
No gesticulation.

10:03.047 --> 10:04.903
I'll take two.

10:05.003 --> 10:07.434
I'll take one.

10:08.853 --> 10:10.455
Flush, jack high.

10:10.555 --> 10:14.108
Sorry, Sonny, straight flush to the king.

10:14.808 --> 10:15.793
Damn.

10:15.893 --> 10:20.065
When you speak to a blind person,
don't omit words like see or look.

10:20.165 --> 10:22.901
No one wants to be asked if they've
heard any good movies lately.

10:23.001 --> 10:24.736
Got it.

10:24.836 --> 10:29.775
Remember, he's a person. His disability
is only one feature of his personality.

10:29.875 --> 10:33.112
- I know who he is.
- He doesn't like fans, either.

10:33.212 --> 10:36.615
No, no, no, what are you doing
with that fucking thing?

10:36.715 --> 10:40.352
If the luddites had persevered,
we'd all be a hell of a lot happier.

10:40.452 --> 10:43.657
- I'll give this shit something to worry about!
- Becca, what's wrong?

10:43.757 --> 10:46.024
I was trying to teach him
about the new GPS app...

10:46.124 --> 10:50.195
...and he started screaming saying that
technology was gonna rob us of our humanity.

10:50.829 --> 10:52.646
Good luck.

10:58.836 --> 11:03.508
Gavin O'Connor, meet Bill Oakland,
our very own Indominus Rex.

11:03.608 --> 11:06.111
You know I prefer the sound
of a lady's voice, Ella.

11:06.211 --> 11:08.981
- Well, he's pretty like a lady.
- When are you going to run away with me?

11:09.081 --> 11:10.816
When are you going to shave?

11:10.916 --> 11:15.705
Everybody keeps talking about how beautiful
you are, Ella. But to me, it's your spice.

11:15.805 --> 11:17.473
Gets me every time.

11:17.573 --> 11:21.350
I'll see you in two hours,
you blind son of a bitch.

11:25.429 --> 11:27.918
Hello, young man, come in, sit down.

11:28.967 --> 11:30.784
Thank you.

11:32.069 --> 11:34.273
- Speak.
- Excuse me?

11:34.373 --> 11:36.575
I'm gonna need a little bit more than that.

11:36.675 --> 11:38.811
- Sorry, I don't understand.
- Keep going.

11:38.911 --> 11:42.514
- Keep going with what?
- For the love of God...

11:42.614 --> 11:46.485
...would you connect three sentences together
so I'll have some sense of whether or not...

11:46.585 --> 11:50.486
...the next two hours of my bleak
and blind life will be bearable...

11:50.586 --> 11:54.023
- ...or torture to my ears. Could you do that?
- Yeah, I...

11:54.123 --> 11:55.995
You're not doing community service, are you?

11:56.095 --> 11:58.130
I volunteered.

11:58.630 --> 12:01.967
Why? You got a hard-on for blind men?

12:02.067 --> 12:05.510
- No, I couldn't get into your class.
- You're an undergrad.

12:05.610 --> 12:08.140
- Sophomore.
- You couldn't get into my class...

12:08.240 --> 12:11.510
...so you found out where I go to have
my students' stories read to me?

12:11.610 --> 12:15.480
- Pretty much.
- I don't appreciate stalkers, O'Connor.

12:15.580 --> 12:17.430
I'm not.

12:21.719 --> 12:26.431
- Seen any good movies lately?
- Are you fucking kidding me?

12:26.531 --> 12:29.615
- Why are you here?
- I want to learn how to write.

12:29.715 --> 12:32.092
- I don't teach people how to write.
- What about your students?

12:32.192 --> 12:33.732
I teach them what not to write.

12:33.832 --> 12:36.535
If they learn something from that,
that's their business.

12:36.635 --> 12:38.560
Sorry I bothered you.

12:38.660 --> 12:41.605
Jesus Christ! O'Connor...

12:41.705 --> 12:44.990
...you're never going to get anywhere
in this world if you give up so easily.

12:45.246 --> 12:48.334
- I mean...
- So you don't want me go?

12:48.434 --> 12:51.987
Well, I don't particularly want you
to stay, you creepy fucking kid...

12:52.087 --> 12:55.420
...but as you can see, there wasn't a line
of people begging to come in here and...

12:55.520 --> 12:59.877
...read my students' mediocre stories
to me, now is there? So...

13:00.992 --> 13:02.543
...proceed.

13:14.605 --> 13:18.242
How To Love A Woman by Joseph Epstein.

13:18.342 --> 13:20.226
Joey Epstein.

13:20.578 --> 13:23.515
Jewish kid from the Bronx who thinks
he knows all the ins and outs...

13:23.615 --> 13:26.685
- ...of how to love a woman.
- Well, does he?

13:26.785 --> 13:29.187
- No.
- Does anyone?

13:29.287 --> 13:30.856
One or two.

13:30.956 --> 13:32.806
Do you?

13:34.358 --> 13:35.549
Read.

13:38.095 --> 13:41.633
Far, far away, behind the word mountains...

13:41.733 --> 13:45.704
...far from the countries,
there lived the blind texts.

13:45.804 --> 13:49.091
Separated, they lived in Bookmarks Groove.

13:49.441 --> 13:53.056
<i>Right at the coast of a large language ocean.</i>

14:01.652 --> 14:05.223
I guess sometimes people get in a rut
and can't see how to get out.

14:05.323 --> 14:09.269
But what Momma must have forgot is,
there's always a way out.

14:14.031 --> 14:18.171
Suzanne Dutchman, while your name
is on the account associated...

14:18.271 --> 14:21.640
...with your husband's
alleged illegal activities...

14:21.740 --> 14:25.444
...and while you did stand to profit
from your husband's actions...

14:25.544 --> 14:29.181
...I do believe that you were not
fully aware of those activities.

14:29.281 --> 14:35.302
Therefore I endorse your plea to 100 hours
of community service effective immediately.

14:44.028 --> 14:45.846
Hey, Ella.

14:46.730 --> 14:48.500
You platza?

14:48.600 --> 14:51.836
- Excuse me?
- The Russian baths out in Brighton Beach.

14:51.936 --> 14:54.573
- Platza.
- I'm still not following you.

14:54.673 --> 14:59.010
They lay you down in a sauna and then
a big fat hairy Russian guy comes in...

14:59.110 --> 15:02.055
...with an oil-dipped oak-leaf brush
and just beats the stress...

15:02.155 --> 15:04.483
...right out of your back and shoulders.

15:04.583 --> 15:06.845
Wow, people pay for this?

15:06.945 --> 15:09.221
They say it keeps you young.

15:09.421 --> 15:12.024
<i>I'm going this Saturday if you're curious.</i>

15:12.524 --> 15:14.726
<i>Back to work, Jimmy.</i>

15:14.926 --> 15:16.810
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

15:24.835 --> 15:28.656
Thank you so much.
I'll see you soon, have a good one.

15:33.611 --> 15:35.280
Hello.

15:35.380 --> 15:37.182
I'm Suzanne Dutchman.

15:37.282 --> 15:39.901
I think I'm supposed to report here.

15:41.919 --> 15:43.821
Dutchman.

15:43.921 --> 15:46.239
Docket number 2564.

15:53.297 --> 15:55.968
Welcome to the Beacon for the Blind.

15:56.068 --> 15:57.951
Right this way.

15:58.435 --> 16:02.642
Always keep in mind his disability
is only one aspect of his personality.

16:03.742 --> 16:07.612
Yeah, you'll get used to it. Use his name
when addressing him in a group setting.

16:07.712 --> 16:09.096
Oh, hey, Janice.

16:09.196 --> 16:13.409
- Don't ever push, poke or shove him.
- Of course not. Why would I do that?

16:13.509 --> 16:17.122
Well, when people see a blind person start
to get up their instinct is to help him.

16:17.222 --> 16:19.595
But with Bill, if he ever needs
any help, he'll let you know.

16:19.695 --> 16:23.061
He can still see shapes and light,
but don't use any hand signals or gestures.

16:23.161 --> 16:25.675
He won't be able to make them out.
And then one last thing...

16:25.775 --> 16:28.833
...for the visually impaired,
feeling is seeing.

16:28.933 --> 16:31.456
- So don't be alarmed if he touches you.
- Touches?

16:31.936 --> 16:34.963
Just give me one minute. Bill?

16:36.140 --> 16:37.642
- Bill.
- Yes?

16:37.742 --> 16:41.313
Good news for you today.
We finally have a female reader for you.

16:41.413 --> 16:43.462
- What does she look like?
- What do you care?

16:43.562 --> 16:45.412
Well, I wasn't always blind.

16:47.852 --> 16:49.402
Suzanne?

16:51.122 --> 16:54.556
Suzanne Dutchman, meet Bill Oakland.

16:54.656 --> 16:56.729
How do you do, Mr. Oakland?

16:57.129 --> 16:59.864
Tough name to carry around
these days, I'm sorry.

16:59.964 --> 17:02.467
- Excuse me?
- Dutchman.

17:02.567 --> 17:07.939
The guy who wanted to lay off 3,000 workers
to make a buck that he didn't really need.

17:08.039 --> 17:10.442
You must have heard of this sociopath.

17:11.142 --> 17:14.027
Yes, I have.

17:15.512 --> 17:17.513
He's my husband.

17:19.733 --> 17:22.755
Well, I'm sure he's nice
once you get to know him.

17:23.255 --> 17:25.723
I'll be leaving you two alone then.

17:26.924 --> 17:29.342
Just... just one minute.

17:31.144 --> 17:33.298
You're not leaving me
alone with him, are you?

17:33.398 --> 17:36.705
- Yes.
- But are you sure that he's stable?

17:36.805 --> 17:38.336
Stable?

17:38.836 --> 17:42.741
He's not the one here because of
a court order, Mrs. Dutchman, you are.

17:42.841 --> 17:46.672
And please keep in mind that if I report
one violation of your agreement...

17:46.772 --> 17:49.681
...you will be remanded to prison.

17:49.781 --> 17:54.449
- I... look, I don't want trouble. I just...
- Then don't commit any violations.

17:55.186 --> 17:56.736
Okay.

18:06.420 --> 18:08.265
Won't you sit down?

18:12.419 --> 18:15.457
What would you like me to read first?

18:15.557 --> 18:19.662
Before we get to that,
I'm just curious, why are you here?

18:20.362 --> 18:22.964
I was given 100 hours of community service.

18:23.064 --> 18:25.934
No, I mean, how did a nice girl like you...

18:26.034 --> 18:29.718
...end up married to an asshole
like Mark Dutchman?

18:30.238 --> 18:32.106
I don't have to explain myself to you.

18:32.206 --> 18:34.222
Well, I already know
everything I need to know.

18:34.322 --> 18:36.211
- Do you?
- Oh, my dear.

18:36.311 --> 18:40.148
Even a visually impaired man
can see what you're all about.

18:40.248 --> 18:42.667
- And what am I all about?
- I know your type.

18:42.767 --> 18:45.066
- And what type is that?
- The type who loves...

18:45.166 --> 18:49.824
...her enormous penthouse and her
ridiculously oversized diamond ring...

18:49.924 --> 18:53.495
...enough to cast a blind eye
to all the heartless acts...

18:53.595 --> 18:56.598
...her husband had to commit
in order to get her these things.

18:56.698 --> 18:58.900
I don't have to tolerate this.

18:59.200 --> 19:04.865
You know, it's actually my civic duty
perhaps to punish you just a little.

19:04.965 --> 19:08.643
Your civic duty to punish me
for a crime I didn't commit...

19:08.743 --> 19:10.679
...and something that you know nothing about.

19:10.779 --> 19:13.782
You know what, go fuck yourself, Mr. Oakland.

19:14.482 --> 19:16.900
It's go fuck yourself, Bill.

19:21.154 --> 19:24.893
- I'd like to request a transfer.
- You're not allowed to leave the room.

19:24.993 --> 19:28.863
Well, I did and I am not spending the next,
I don't know, however many months...

19:28.963 --> 19:33.668
...reading to that cretin in a prison cell
of a room. He's absolutely repugnant.

19:33.768 --> 19:36.602
Did someone tell you
this is supposed to be fun?

19:37.172 --> 19:39.607
You have an hour and 40 minutes left.

19:39.707 --> 19:41.459
And remember, one violation.

19:41.559 --> 19:43.979
So I suggest you get back there.

19:44.979 --> 19:46.529
Now.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.191
Oh, my God.

19:57.157 --> 19:58.526
Can we just start reading?

19:58.626 --> 20:01.463
You know, it's rude to leave
the room without telling me.

20:01.563 --> 20:04.733
I was sitting here talking
to you and now I don't know...

20:04.833 --> 20:07.251
...what you heard and what you missed.

20:09.036 --> 20:11.054
You could be nicer to me.

20:14.908 --> 20:19.526
Look, we got off on the wrong foot.
Could we start over again?

20:20.148 --> 20:21.698
No.

20:22.215 --> 20:23.766
Why not?

20:24.618 --> 20:26.449
Because I don't want to.

20:35.162 --> 20:37.232
Why don't we begin with...

20:38.132 --> 20:41.585
Margie Thompson, Jeannie Lost Her Way.

20:43.186 --> 20:46.039
So, what's the latest with Mark?

20:47.541 --> 20:49.393
When's he getting out?

20:50.544 --> 20:53.197
He just keeps telling me not to worry.

20:54.748 --> 20:56.599
But I'm worried.

20:58.652 --> 21:01.489
Well, he's going to get out, right?

21:01.789 --> 21:05.076
It's Mark, I'm sure
he's gonna figure out a way.

21:10.764 --> 21:14.002
Can you believe that he
hasn't even apologized to me?

21:14.802 --> 21:18.573
I don't know whatever this crap is
that he and Howard got into.

21:18.673 --> 21:21.743
Using the family account, what an idiot.

21:23.410 --> 21:26.849
- Everyone makes mistakes.
- Yeah, well, this is a big one.

21:27.749 --> 21:29.818
At least you're not the one in prison.

21:30.418 --> 21:33.856
After all, how bad could reading
to a blind man really be?

21:34.556 --> 21:36.157
You try it.

21:36.257 --> 21:38.393
- If it were me.
- Yeah?

21:38.493 --> 21:41.996
I'd make the most of it. Have a little fun.

21:42.096 --> 21:45.550
Why not? Try something outrageous...

21:45.650 --> 21:49.304
...that you can only get away with
if you're stuck in a room with a blind man.

21:50.404 --> 21:52.489
I mean, is he good looking?

21:54.107 --> 21:58.796
Believe me, there is nothing fun
about spending time with this man.

22:02.183 --> 22:05.119
<i>Hey, it's me calling, I just want to
let you know that I went to the store...</i>

22:05.219 --> 22:08.857
<i>...and I'm gonna cook you
one hell of a sexy dinner.</i>

22:09.757 --> 22:11.842
<i>So work up an appetite.</i>

22:13.795 --> 22:17.246
<i>Hey, it's me calling.</i>

22:18.064 --> 22:21.235
<i>Have I told you lately
how brilliant and bold...</i>

22:21.335 --> 22:24.972
<i>...and how beautiful, and brave,
and all the other b-words...</i>

22:25.072 --> 22:28.691
<i>...that mean perfect man, that you are?</i>

22:29.743 --> 22:32.781
<i>In case you don't know
who's calling, this is your wife.</i>

22:33.481 --> 22:35.898
<i>Anyway, I love you.</i>

22:41.021 --> 22:44.792
- Hey, how it's going, Ella?
- Oh, Gaelin, how are you?

22:44.892 --> 22:46.909
No, it's Gavin.

22:47.394 --> 22:49.464
- Oh, sorry.
- That's all right.

22:49.564 --> 22:51.911
We tried to call you but the number
you gave us didn't work.

22:52.011 --> 22:54.669
Yeah, I'm sorry, I had to switch my service.

22:54.769 --> 22:59.190
Bill's been assigned a court ordered reader
so he won't be needing you anymore.

23:02.836 --> 23:05.094
Can I go up and say goodbye?

23:05.512 --> 23:07.029
Please.

23:08.315 --> 23:10.200
Pretty please.

23:12.219 --> 23:14.070
Five minutes.

23:14.621 --> 23:16.439
Thank you.

23:23.296 --> 23:26.267
So I hear you finally got a woman's voice.

23:26.367 --> 23:30.104
- Is that you, Gavin?
- The one and only.

23:30.204 --> 23:32.450
Come in for a minute, sit down.

23:35.777 --> 23:38.300
I just wanted to come by and say that...

23:38.400 --> 23:40.682
...it's been real fun hanging out with you.

23:40.782 --> 23:42.917
You are a true masochist, Gavin.

23:43.017 --> 23:46.921
Well, the truth is my father
ran out on me when I was two.

23:47.021 --> 23:51.283
- Hold on, let me get out my violin.
- Would you just listen to me for a second?

23:52.460 --> 23:54.462
I got into a lot of fights as a kid.

23:54.562 --> 23:57.065
- Good for you.
- My mother was great to me.

23:57.165 --> 24:00.200
She... she was really lonely.

24:00.300 --> 24:04.372
Ended up with a really nice guy
and I should be thankful, but...

24:04.472 --> 24:07.175
He wasn't a man, you know what I mean?

24:07.275 --> 24:08.776
I might.

24:08.876 --> 24:11.513
When I read "Throw it
on the Line for Venus..."

24:12.113 --> 24:14.796
...for the first time in my life,
Bill, it was like...

24:14.896 --> 24:17.785
...someone taught me
what it meant to be a man.

24:17.885 --> 24:19.887
When did I tell you you could call me Bill?

24:19.987 --> 24:23.191
- Seriously.
- What is it you want to say, Gavin?

24:23.291 --> 24:25.042
You still live up to your book.

24:27.260 --> 24:30.331
And I lied to you. I'm not enrolled at NYU.

24:30.431 --> 24:33.234
I moved to New York two months ago
with 700 bucks in my pocket.

24:33.334 --> 24:35.137
And you know what, Bill?

24:36.037 --> 24:37.887
It was worth it.

24:44.110 --> 24:46.129
Are you handy, Gavin?

24:47.814 --> 24:49.417
What do you mean?

24:49.517 --> 24:51.539
I have some projects I'm working on at home.

24:51.639 --> 24:54.925
Maybe you could come by
and give me a hand this weekend.

24:57.524 --> 24:59.342
Call me on Friday.

25:00.493 --> 25:02.044
Cool.

25:03.530 --> 25:07.334
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you.

25:07.434 --> 25:09.452
No, not at all.

25:09.836 --> 25:11.606
You're just in time to meet my protege.

25:11.706 --> 25:15.176
The only kid crazy enough
to volunteer to read for me.

25:15.276 --> 25:17.912
Gavin O'Connor, meet Suzanne Dutchman.

25:18.012 --> 25:20.665
- How do you do?
- Fascinated to meet you.

25:20.765 --> 25:24.133
- Oh, why is that?
- I just can't imagine anyone...

25:24.233 --> 25:26.888
...volunteering to spend time with this man.

25:26.988 --> 25:31.659
Well, he's an acquired taste,
but he's worth it.

25:31.759 --> 25:34.028
All right, Gavin, I'll talk to you on Friday.

25:34.128 --> 25:38.181
- Thanks, Bill. It was nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.

25:42.569 --> 25:47.770
I'm sorry I talked to you that way.
I had no call to treat you like that.

25:51.111 --> 25:54.182
Thank you. I appreciate your apology.

25:54.982 --> 25:56.833
How was your day off?

25:58.451 --> 26:00.336
It was fine.

26:01.721 --> 26:03.606
That's good.

26:06.092 --> 26:08.096
You still don't like me, do you?

26:08.496 --> 26:10.431
Am I supposed to like you?

26:10.531 --> 26:12.382
You might try.

26:13.734 --> 26:18.596
I'm sure that you were self-centered
and narcissistic before your accident.

26:19.006 --> 26:22.689
And now you're self-centered,
narcissistic and blind.

26:25.445 --> 26:27.484
I brought you a present.

26:29.883 --> 26:32.153
Is it a green tea candle?

26:32.453 --> 26:34.337
It might be.

26:34.921 --> 26:38.924
- Why, can you smell it?
- Yes. It stinks.

26:40.460 --> 26:43.037
- You don't like green tea?
- No.

26:43.137 --> 26:46.504
But I'll tell you what I do like.
I like your perfume.

26:47.867 --> 26:49.846
Muguet de Bois.

26:51.072 --> 26:53.521
How do you know Muguet de Bois?

26:53.941 --> 26:56.143
They don't make it anymore.

26:56.243 --> 26:58.728
My stepmother used to wear it.

26:59.780 --> 27:03.032
Well, she's got good taste.

27:03.616 --> 27:07.470
Yes. In everything except men.

27:10.090 --> 27:12.593
So do I just take one
from the top of the stack?

27:12.693 --> 27:17.031
Yes, and please get rid
of that foul smelling candle.

27:17.131 --> 27:20.883
- It really does stink in here.
- You'll get used to it.

27:34.514 --> 27:36.350
So where are we?

27:36.450 --> 27:39.260
The grand jury's being sworn and they're
gonna start to hear evidence soon.

27:39.360 --> 27:41.756
- How long?
- It's impossible to say at this time...

27:41.856 --> 27:44.659
- ...but you know, maybe 3 or 4 weeks.
- Not good enough.

27:44.759 --> 27:49.863
Mark... I need you to take
an honest look at what you're facing.

27:49.963 --> 27:53.284
There's a possibility of you
doing substantial time.

27:53.384 --> 27:56.603
Your associate is testifying against you.

27:58.638 --> 28:00.643
Arnold, let me ask you something.

28:02.842 --> 28:07.063
Why the fuck am I paying you
$1200 an hour for?

28:07.947 --> 28:10.451
- To represent your interests.
- Tell me again?

28:10.551 --> 28:14.388
- To represent your interests.
- So why are you telling me the obvious?

28:14.488 --> 28:18.359
Do your job, stop dicking around
and get me the fuck out of here.

28:18.459 --> 28:19.909
Okay.

28:21.561 --> 28:23.534
Thank you, my beautiful wife is here.

28:23.634 --> 28:26.301
- Hello, Arnold.
- Mrs. Dutchman.

28:26.901 --> 28:29.585
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

28:32.829 --> 28:34.657
Any progress?

28:36.209 --> 28:38.246
I have faith in the legal system.

28:39.346 --> 28:41.515
Is he saying how long?

28:41.615 --> 28:44.467
Soon. Soon.

28:47.520 --> 28:51.972
- Are you doing okay in here?
- It's not a situation I can't handle.

28:54.094 --> 28:55.926
Where's your ring?

28:56.026 --> 28:59.039
I didn't think it was a good time
to be flaunting what we have.

28:59.139 --> 29:02.218
I want that ring on your finger. You hear me?

29:03.604 --> 29:06.280
- Mark...
- There's nothing to be ashamed of.

29:06.707 --> 29:09.326
It's just a little uncomfortable.

29:11.844 --> 29:15.731
- Tell me about the community service.
- It's fine.

29:16.215 --> 29:18.185
What do you want to know?

29:18.285 --> 29:21.844
This blind man you read to.

29:22.512 --> 29:24.380
What's he do?

29:24.791 --> 29:27.595
He was a novelist and now he teaches.

29:28.195 --> 29:29.696
Teaches.

29:29.796 --> 29:32.233
- What's his name?
- Bill Oakland.

29:32.333 --> 29:35.503
He wrote that book,
"Throw it on the Line for Venus."

29:35.603 --> 29:39.707
- It made a lot of money.
- He doesn't have a lot of money now.

29:39.807 --> 29:41.408
What'd you think?

29:41.508 --> 29:44.193
- Of the book?
- Yeah.

29:45.411 --> 29:46.929
I never read it.

29:48.815 --> 29:52.553
"She put down her book, leaned back and
clasped the paper knife tightly in both hands.

29:52.653 --> 29:56.690
"There was nothing to be ashamed of.
She called up all her Moscow memories.

29:56.790 --> 29:59.254
"She recalled the ball, and Vronsky
and his humble, enamored gaze...

29:59.354 --> 30:03.038
"...and their relations with one another.
There was nothing to be ashamed of."

30:03.138 --> 30:06.340
Hold on. Hold on.
Why are you reading it that way?

30:06.440 --> 30:08.920
- What way?
- As if it has no meaning.

30:09.020 --> 30:11.405
This is the most
important moment in the book.

30:11.505 --> 30:15.687
This is the moment that Anna realizes
that she can no longer go on...

30:15.787 --> 30:19.213
...bullshitting herself
that she's happy with her life.

30:20.013 --> 30:22.006
- Okay.
- And once you cross that line...

30:22.106 --> 30:25.506
...you either have to make the terrifying
change that will alter your life...

30:25.606 --> 30:27.832
...in ways you can't imagine...

30:28.757 --> 30:30.458
- ...or.
- Or?

30:30.558 --> 30:32.159
You take the safe route.

30:32.259 --> 30:36.330
To live out the rest of your days
drowning in that familiar security...

30:36.430 --> 30:40.108
...while at night your dreams are filled
with feasts you never touched...

30:40.968 --> 30:43.052
...and love you never tasted.

30:47.006 --> 30:49.009
Why aren't you saying anything?

30:49.458 --> 30:52.313
I thought I was supposed to be
reading your students' stories.

30:52.413 --> 30:56.363
I'm teaching Karenina next semester.
I wanted to get reacquainted.

30:56.463 --> 30:58.200
Okay, sorry, I'm...

30:58.985 --> 31:01.689
- Where were we?
- "Nothing to be ashamed of."

31:01.789 --> 31:04.825
Right. "There's nothing to be ashamed of.

31:04.925 --> 31:06.752
"And yet...

31:06.852 --> 31:10.231
"...at this very point
of her recollections...

31:10.331 --> 31:12.269
"...the feeling of shame was intensified...

31:12.369 --> 31:15.336
<i>"...just as though when she
was thinking about Vronsky...</i>

31:15.436 --> 31:19.488
<i>"...some inner voice said to her,
warm, very warm, hot.</i>

31:19.940 --> 31:24.044
<i>"While she said to herself resolutely
changing her position on the seat...</i>

31:24.144 --> 31:27.014
<i>"...what about it? What does it mean?</i>

31:27.114 --> 31:30.984
<i>"Am I really afraid to look straight
at what passed between us?</i>

31:31.084 --> 31:34.420
<i>"Well, what did pass between us,
is there really...</i>

31:34.520 --> 31:37.491
<i>"...can there be anything more
between myself and that boy officer...</i>

31:37.591 --> 31:41.678
<i>"...than there is between me
and every one of my acquaintances?"</i>

32:52.498 --> 32:57.118
Oh, honey pot, you like your Chanel No. 5.

33:15.988 --> 33:18.426
<i>"Something in my blood was screaming out...</i>

33:18.526 --> 33:22.029
"...at the top of his lungs,
can we still save the big easy?"

33:22.429 --> 33:24.330
Can we open the window?

33:26.199 --> 33:30.787
- I'm sorry, would you repeat that?
- Can we open... open the window?

33:32.772 --> 33:37.044
If I may, please don't break
the rhythm of a sentence...

33:37.144 --> 33:39.313
...to ask some question.

33:39.413 --> 33:42.750
I mean, the kid was getting close
to writing a halfway decent line...

33:42.850 --> 33:44.918
...and now the rhythm is lost to me.

33:45.018 --> 33:47.890
It's just really uncomfortably hot in here.

33:49.590 --> 33:52.541
- What is going on with you today?
- Nothing.

33:52.992 --> 33:54.577
Is everything okay?

33:55.395 --> 33:57.665
Everything's fine, it's just...

33:58.265 --> 34:00.149
...it's just hot.

34:02.769 --> 34:06.740
Look, it isn't easy to edit
when you can't look at the words.

34:06.840 --> 34:09.846
I'm sure you understand.
We can't open the window...

34:09.946 --> 34:13.512
...because the noise from outside
makes it hard for me to...

34:13.612 --> 34:16.882
...follow the rhythm of each sentence...

34:16.983 --> 34:20.000
...paragraph, page, so...

34:21.654 --> 34:23.505
...can you help me?

34:23.989 --> 34:26.286
Yes, yes.

34:27.527 --> 34:29.396
"The snake...

34:30.715 --> 34:32.339
"...of the river below...

34:32.438 --> 34:36.469
"...as you fly into the city
is a good portent for the balance...

34:36.570 --> 34:41.255
"...between sweet and sinister
one encounters in New Orleans.

34:42.241 --> 34:46.047
"The winding river works
his way through her center...

34:46.547 --> 34:50.292
"...providing the city with life
knowing all the time...

34:50.391 --> 34:53.319
"...he can take it away on a whim.

34:53.418 --> 34:57.424
"Down by the river, in the heart of
the quarter, there stands a statue.

34:57.524 --> 35:00.761
"Old man river, a man with a past.

35:00.861 --> 35:03.530
"Arms reach empty handed...

35:03.630 --> 35:05.632
"...God to a city in love with..."

35:05.732 --> 35:07.433
Wait.

35:07.533 --> 35:10.704
- What just happened?
- I don't know, he kinda lost me here.

35:10.804 --> 35:12.855
No, I mean with you.

35:14.407 --> 35:18.022
- Nothing.
- Your scent just changed.

35:18.122 --> 35:22.165
- What do you mean my scent?
- Your pheromones got stronger.

35:24.750 --> 35:26.604
Hey, Bill, just getting the...

35:27.454 --> 35:30.223
- ...trash.
- Hey, Joey.

35:30.323 --> 35:32.693
How's that Shakespeare workshop coming?

35:32.793 --> 35:34.662
Just great, Bill.

35:35.162 --> 35:38.726
- In fact, it's fan-fucking-tastic.
- That's good to hear.

35:39.266 --> 35:42.904
Okay, then... you two have a good time.

35:45.771 --> 35:47.623
Where were we?

35:49.275 --> 35:52.761
"God to a city in love with water."

35:56.383 --> 35:57.598
Hi.

35:57.698 --> 36:00.453
It was just really,
really hot in there today.

36:01.680 --> 36:03.241
What?

36:06.292 --> 36:08.911
I feel like I'm going crazy.

36:09.662 --> 36:12.125
Like I'm... like I'm losing my shit.

36:12.225 --> 36:14.835
I don't even know what's real anymore.

36:14.935 --> 36:18.338
I don't even know if I know
who Mark is anymore.

36:18.438 --> 36:21.108
I don't even know if I know who I am.

36:21.208 --> 36:24.811
Well, I know who you are
and I think you're fucking fabulous.

36:24.911 --> 36:26.728
That's real.

36:27.513 --> 36:29.983
Do you think Mark's a good guy?

36:30.083 --> 36:33.903
What? I mean, yeah, of course.

36:34.887 --> 36:37.692
Do you really think that he's a good man?

36:38.492 --> 36:40.794
Yes. Why would you ask me that?

36:40.894 --> 36:43.018
He's having an affair.

36:44.697 --> 36:46.548
My God.

36:47.033 --> 36:48.535
Are you sure?

36:48.635 --> 36:50.603
I'm sure.

36:50.703 --> 36:52.706
Do you know who she is?

36:52.806 --> 36:54.656
Not yet.

36:55.174 --> 36:57.044
God, I feel so stupid.

36:57.144 --> 37:00.547
- You're not stupid.
- No, I really, I feel so stupid.

37:00.647 --> 37:02.684
Like such an idiot.

37:07.253 --> 37:10.506
Fuck him. What are you gonna do?

37:12.224 --> 37:15.028
I don't know,
it feels like it's all falling apart.

37:15.128 --> 37:17.330
- Suze.
- Literally everything...

37:17.430 --> 37:19.871
...everything is falling apart.

37:21.333 --> 37:23.786
But something has to change...

37:27.506 --> 37:29.992
...'cause this isn't working.

37:49.467 --> 37:50.946
What you looking for?

37:51.046 --> 37:53.215
I was just checking to make sure
this is the right place.

37:53.315 --> 37:55.836
- The right place for what?
- I'm looking for a friend of mine.

37:55.936 --> 37:57.671
- Papi, who?
- Bill Oakland.

37:57.771 --> 38:00.607
Yeah, this is the right place.
I'm the super, he expecting you?

38:00.707 --> 38:02.809
- Yeah.
- Hey, you want a beer?

38:02.909 --> 38:05.213
Thanks, but it's a little early for me.

38:06.613 --> 38:09.240
Don't ever let people tell you how to live.

38:10.784 --> 38:12.818
Bill's on the second floor.

38:14.220 --> 38:16.873
- Thanks, man.
- You got it, buddy.

38:41.514 --> 38:43.065
Bill?

38:44.183 --> 38:46.034
I'm back here.

38:48.754 --> 38:50.305
Hey.

38:57.763 --> 39:00.018
Welcome, Gavin, make yourself at home.

39:01.768 --> 39:03.372
Gee, thanks.

39:06.105 --> 39:07.506
So...

39:08.574 --> 39:10.916
...what's this project you're talking about?

39:21.554 --> 39:25.192
You know this wasn't really what I had
in mind when you said projects.

39:26.192 --> 39:27.742
Scrub.

39:40.472 --> 39:42.540
You don't have a vacuum cleaner?

39:43.744 --> 39:45.073
No.

39:47.012 --> 39:50.254
- Bill.
- I don't entertain much.

39:51.284 --> 39:53.485
So what are you having me do all of this for?

39:54.521 --> 39:56.490
You ever see the Karate Kid?

39:57.190 --> 39:58.471
Yeah.

40:32.458 --> 40:34.531
You're awfully quiet, Gavin.

40:35.195 --> 40:37.816
I just had an idea for a short story.

40:39.266 --> 40:41.869
See, there's a method to my madness.

40:42.269 --> 40:43.749
Right.

40:58.183 --> 41:00.353
I'll be out soon, baby.

41:00.453 --> 41:04.067
Best assured you won't be doing
community service any longer.

41:06.325 --> 41:08.744
It's not that bad, actually.

41:10.095 --> 41:11.947
Not that bad?

41:15.984 --> 41:19.067
What, you like reading to this guy?

41:20.039 --> 41:21.942
No, it's not that.

41:22.042 --> 41:26.061
It just feels good to be productive again.

41:27.779 --> 41:29.616
What's that supposed to mean?

41:29.716 --> 41:32.968
I need stability outside of you.

41:35.527 --> 41:37.408
Why would you say that?

41:38.258 --> 41:39.808
Why?

41:40.092 --> 41:42.462
Because you made choices.

41:42.562 --> 41:44.732
Choices that you didn't consult me on.

41:45.532 --> 41:49.002
You know how many choices I make in a day?

41:49.602 --> 41:51.705
Am I supposed to consult you on every one?

41:51.805 --> 41:54.441
I don't care how many decisions
you have to make.

41:54.541 --> 41:57.611
I care about this decision
which landed you here...

41:57.711 --> 41:59.912
...and implicated me.

42:00.012 --> 42:01.882
We're not guilty!

42:01.982 --> 42:06.019
Howard is. You'll understand that
when I'm out of this hellhole...

42:06.119 --> 42:09.205
...and you won't have to read
to any fucking cripple anymore.

42:12.958 --> 42:15.595
I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry.

42:15.695 --> 42:17.865
Just this place is getting to me.

42:18.465 --> 42:20.882
You can... listen to me.

42:21.600 --> 42:24.285
I got your back, huh?

42:25.004 --> 42:26.974
You can depend on me.

42:27.574 --> 42:29.458
I promise you.

42:34.747 --> 42:37.050
So how come you never finished
your second book?

42:37.150 --> 42:41.254
- How come you never finished your first?
- I'm building life experience.

42:41.354 --> 42:44.758
What's your story, Gavin? You got a girl?

42:45.058 --> 42:48.715
There's a girl. I'm just waiting
for the moment to present itself.

42:48.815 --> 42:52.464
- What's she like?
- Well, you know her.

42:54.666 --> 42:56.436
You mean Ella?

42:56.536 --> 42:58.939
- Yeah.
- Forget it.

42:59.039 --> 43:02.775
- What?
- Don't stop cleaning, by the way.

43:02.875 --> 43:05.945
You are definitely not ready
for a girl like that.

43:06.045 --> 43:10.066
You might not know this, Bill,
but I am a very good-looking guy.

43:10.166 --> 43:13.353
That's so funny, because you
don't come across like one.

43:13.453 --> 43:15.989
Well, I was voted best
looking guy in high school.

43:16.089 --> 43:20.775
Not enough for a quality woman,
a keeper like Ella.

43:21.060 --> 43:23.944
And besides, your looks are
only one part of the equation.

43:24.364 --> 43:26.199
So what's the rest?

43:26.499 --> 43:30.369
Smarts, humor, money.

43:30.469 --> 43:33.106
The ability to make her feel safe.

43:33.206 --> 43:37.291
The... the unpredictability of a great lover.

43:38.143 --> 43:40.981
So I got four out of five,
with potential for money.

43:41.081 --> 43:43.784
- How you gonna make money?
- Writing.

43:44.184 --> 43:45.733
What?

43:47.386 --> 43:50.657
One day, you're gonna meet a girl.

43:50.957 --> 43:53.560
And she's gonna be
lying in your arms in bed...

43:53.660 --> 43:56.104
...and everything is just...

43:56.504 --> 43:58.364
...going to make sense.

43:58.797 --> 44:03.020
Jesus, Bill. You're getting me
all hot and bothered over here.

44:03.470 --> 44:07.107
No, but seriously, when was the last time?

44:07.207 --> 44:10.277
You know, the last time
you were with a woman?

44:10.877 --> 44:12.579
Not since my wife.

44:12.679 --> 44:15.916
- Jesus!
- Your sympathy is much appreciated.

44:16.416 --> 44:18.518
I'd lose my fucking mind.

44:18.618 --> 44:22.261
- How do you know I haven't already?
- Oh, that explains a lot.

44:27.759 --> 44:29.780
Hey, Bill, I'm leaving.

44:36.502 --> 44:38.052
Bill.

44:43.275 --> 44:44.826
Gavin!

44:45.226 --> 44:46.749
What?

44:47.446 --> 44:51.296
I didn't expect you to work
for the privilege of my company.

44:51.884 --> 44:53.553
I don't want to take your money, Bill.

44:53.653 --> 44:57.090
I'm not offering you money,
you presumptive little shit.

44:57.190 --> 44:59.912
I'm inviting you to sit in on my class.

45:01.794 --> 45:05.165
- You mean that?
- Consider it a token of my appreciation.

45:05.765 --> 45:07.582
Thank you, Bill.

45:08.367 --> 45:10.703
You're all right, O'Connor.

45:10.803 --> 45:15.074
- Not the worst you ever met, right?
- You're quoting my book.

45:15.174 --> 45:16.992
Get the fuck out of here.

45:34.927 --> 45:37.097
What's your problem, Michelle?

45:37.197 --> 45:40.651
I don't know how many more
of these parties I can do.

45:42.668 --> 45:47.837
Well, the party is in my honor.
It would be rude not to show up.

45:50.342 --> 45:55.730
Rude? How about how rude it is
that you're never home anymore?

46:11.897 --> 46:14.634
Our strong readers
could come in three hours early.

46:14.734 --> 46:18.338
And then you can do the rounds
I would normally be doing...

46:18.438 --> 46:22.065
...when I'm talking to the volunteers that
first come here. That would be helpful.

46:22.165 --> 46:25.878
And then there was one other thing
that I wanted to ask you.

46:25.978 --> 46:28.681
Oh, hey, Bill. You're here early.

46:28.781 --> 46:31.551
I just thought I'd do a little cleaning
before she gets here.

46:31.651 --> 46:34.716
Oh, my. You do windows too?

46:36.555 --> 46:39.140
Anyway, where was I?

46:50.836 --> 46:55.069
I must be in the wrong room.
I was looking for Bill Oakland.

46:56.642 --> 46:58.660
You inspired me.

46:59.211 --> 47:01.062
I inspired you?

47:01.713 --> 47:03.950
Every time you walk in this room...

47:04.050 --> 47:07.754
...you make me feel something
I thought I never would again.

47:07.854 --> 47:09.592
And what's that?

47:10.322 --> 47:11.839
Possibilities.

47:18.164 --> 47:21.916
- Do you need to get that?
- Yes, I'm sorry.

47:31.176 --> 47:33.013
Is everything okay?

47:33.713 --> 47:36.434
Yes. Great.

47:39.384 --> 47:41.654
May I ask you to do something for me?

47:42.254 --> 47:43.804
Sure.

47:45.525 --> 47:49.155
It's a lot to ask, but you'd
really be doing me a big favor.

47:55.364 --> 47:57.467
I used to love the smell of this.

47:58.137 --> 48:00.407
Reminds me of when I was a kid.

48:01.107 --> 48:04.277
My father injured himself
in a grilling accident...

48:04.377 --> 48:07.080
...and I had to shave him for two weeks.

48:07.580 --> 48:10.383
That sounds so naughty, but I love it.

48:10.483 --> 48:12.367
Don't be obscene.

48:13.084 --> 48:15.600
We're all just trying to get home, I suppose.

48:17.457 --> 48:22.028
I'm about to put an extremely
sharp razor against your neck.

48:22.128 --> 48:24.931
I would choose my next words carefully.

48:25.031 --> 48:27.248
They could be your last.

48:28.333 --> 48:30.018
I'm in your hands.

48:48.253 --> 48:49.805
Nice.

48:51.990 --> 48:55.024
How many times did you say
you shaved your father?

48:55.124 --> 48:56.917
I was a kid.

48:57.997 --> 49:02.068
Look, I need to get your chin.
There you go, stretch it out.

49:02.168 --> 49:03.718
Sexy.

49:06.538 --> 49:08.389
How do I look?

49:12.043 --> 49:13.895
Very handsome.

49:21.220 --> 49:23.105
<i>Suzanne Dutchman.</i>

49:50.682 --> 49:52.503
What's up, homes?

49:54.052 --> 49:57.972
What's the matter? You got ass-burgers?

49:59.758 --> 50:03.421
- What?
- Ass-burgers.

50:04.762 --> 50:06.766
You anti-social or something, hey?

50:07.366 --> 50:09.135
You mean Asperger's?

50:09.835 --> 50:14.675
No, I don't. I just don't particularly
want to talk right now, okay?

50:15.675 --> 50:18.361
Listen to this particular motherfucker.

50:21.480 --> 50:23.296
From now on, you don't eat.

50:23.396 --> 50:27.068
You bring your food, you put it on a tray
and you bring it to me.

50:27.919 --> 50:31.681
Big Ricky G. <i>Entiendes?</i> You understand?

50:34.359 --> 50:37.365
Didn't your mother teach you
not to touch another man's brownie?

50:38.965 --> 50:41.121
What the fuck did you say about my mother?

50:54.613 --> 50:56.636
Break it up, break it up!

51:12.848 --> 51:14.928
<i>Now exiting subway.</i>

51:17.202 --> 51:20.365
<i>Your destination is 200 feet straight ahead.</i>

51:23.008 --> 51:25.047
<i>Beacon for the Blind.</i>

51:25.778 --> 51:28.162
<i>Approaching 50 feet.</i>

51:30.215 --> 51:32.685
<i>You've now arrived at your destination.</i>

51:32.785 --> 51:34.635
<i>Turn right.</i>

51:49.000 --> 51:50.551
Hello.

51:50.969 --> 51:53.618
- Oh, you're here early.
- I am.

51:54.139 --> 51:56.157
How are you today?

51:56.641 --> 52:00.260
Well... I'm doing okay.

52:01.179 --> 52:04.532
- How are you doing?
- I'm pretty good.

52:05.283 --> 52:08.736
What would you like to
start with today? Maybe...

52:09.454 --> 52:12.151
Margie Thompson? "Get her out of the way."

52:13.775 --> 52:17.795
I want to go to the park.
I want you to take me to the park.

52:20.031 --> 52:21.967
I'm not allowed to leave the room.

52:22.067 --> 52:24.851
I know, so...

52:25.570 --> 52:27.522
...we'd better not get caught.

52:35.214 --> 52:38.084
- I want to hold onto you.
- But I don't know if I know how to do this.

52:38.184 --> 52:40.268
It's okay, I'll show you.

52:42.520 --> 52:45.725
- How you doing, boss?
- What'd you find?

52:45.825 --> 52:49.896
She reads to him two hours, three times
a week and then she goes home.

52:50.796 --> 52:51.982
That it?

52:52.082 --> 52:55.067
Yeah, I don't think you got
anything to worry about there.

52:55.167 --> 52:57.670
Have you seen what my wife looks like?

52:57.770 --> 53:01.189
Yes, boss, but he's blind.

53:02.674 --> 53:05.088
That doesn't make him a eunuch.

53:06.344 --> 53:10.230
I'm on it, Mr. Dutchman. Take care.

53:13.719 --> 53:17.624
I feel like we're the bad kids
ditching school to go smoke.

53:17.724 --> 53:20.427
- What's wrong with that?
- You were one of the bad kids.

53:20.527 --> 53:23.062
I was as a matter of fact,
but that's a long time ago.

53:23.162 --> 53:25.698
Isn't this pond just beautiful?

53:25.798 --> 53:28.901
And that rock face over there,
its just exquisite. Don't you think?

53:29.001 --> 53:33.606
Yes, I do. It's stunning.
Do you still remember what it looks like?

53:33.706 --> 53:35.775
Oh, yes, yes, I do.

53:35.875 --> 53:39.178
I have to reimagine it over
and over again so I don't forget.

53:39.278 --> 53:43.716
No, it's the other things
that are hard about going blind.

53:43.816 --> 53:45.975
- Like what things?
- You have to...

53:46.075 --> 53:48.676
...relearn everything like a child.

53:49.021 --> 53:52.789
How to wash yourself.
How to boil water. How to function.

53:52.889 --> 53:56.726
It took me a year just to get up the nerve
to step outside my apartment.

53:59.230 --> 54:02.335
Well, and now look at you,
escorting me to the park.

54:02.435 --> 54:04.319
What are the chances?

54:08.641 --> 54:10.543
- Is this the ball field?
- Yes.

54:10.643 --> 54:13.448
- You know what I like about this ball field?
- What's that?

54:13.548 --> 54:16.883
Is that I can walk around here
without my hands in front of my face.

54:16.983 --> 54:19.523
You don't walk around
with your hands in front of your face.

54:19.623 --> 54:22.489
That doesn't mean I live without that fear.

54:23.189 --> 54:27.193
You know, I played football on this field
every weekend until I was 40.

54:27.593 --> 54:29.895
- Are there kids on the field right now?
- No, we're...

54:29.995 --> 54:32.413
Okay, then hit me long!

54:33.231 --> 54:34.699
Bill!

54:35.366 --> 54:36.669
Oh, shit.

54:36.769 --> 54:38.137
Bill!

54:38.237 --> 54:40.005
Bill!

54:40.105 --> 54:42.475
Bill, are you okay?

54:42.575 --> 54:45.645
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

54:45.745 --> 54:47.580
Don't ever do that again.

54:47.680 --> 54:49.886
- Wait.
- What?

54:49.986 --> 54:52.200
I think I can see.

54:53.818 --> 54:57.523
Shit, we're gonna be late.
Get... get up, come on.

54:57.623 --> 54:59.907
Get up, get up.

55:09.868 --> 55:12.004
- She's there.
- Let's take the stairs.

55:12.104 --> 55:14.040
10 o'clock, 10 o'clock.

55:14.140 --> 55:16.191
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

55:18.543 --> 55:20.980
"When she read how Lady Mary
rode to the hounds...

55:21.080 --> 55:22.782
"...teased the bride and astonished...

55:22.882 --> 55:25.818
- "...everybody by her boldness..."
- It's 4:04."

55:25.918 --> 55:28.788
Ella, if I could have another moment
with Mrs. Dutchman.

55:28.888 --> 55:31.994
- I want to hear the end of this chapter.
- Yeah, well, that's up to her.

55:32.094 --> 55:35.776
Oh, it's a page and a half. It's fine.

55:38.162 --> 55:40.395
Okay, suit yourself.

55:47.739 --> 55:50.591
- What is it?
- It's a leaf.

55:55.147 --> 55:56.697
Hi.

56:44.729 --> 56:48.601
Okay, okay, now you all know I respect
y'all's opinions, but I'm sorry.

56:48.701 --> 56:50.536
Can we please just talk about...

56:50.636 --> 56:55.608
...the obvious latent homosexuality
rampant throughout this chapter?

56:55.708 --> 56:58.044
I mean, the blood, the flesh...

56:58.144 --> 57:00.413
...and the 11 Greeks
piling out of Camille's house...

57:00.513 --> 57:04.250
...and Dean stays in bed for three days.

57:04.350 --> 57:09.755
Hello? Is there any question that Sal
wants to stick it up Dean's ass?

57:09.855 --> 57:12.458
Hey, come on. A little respect, please.

57:12.558 --> 57:16.162
Oh, I'm sorry, did you have another
interpretation, homophobe?

57:16.262 --> 57:18.364
I see on the road as being a little deeper...

57:18.464 --> 57:21.567
...than Sal just wanting
to stick it up Dean's ass, yes.

57:21.667 --> 57:24.770
Darling, you can go as deep as you like.

57:24.870 --> 57:27.807
I think Kerouac's saying Dean is Christ.

57:27.907 --> 57:31.527
- Closeted!
- All right, enough of this shit.

57:33.244 --> 57:36.182
A writer is always entitled
to his intention just as the reader...

57:36.282 --> 57:40.386
...is always entitled to his
interpretation of the work.

57:40.486 --> 57:44.073
A lot of people think that Kerouac
was, as Kyle put it, closeted.

57:44.173 --> 57:47.451
But when it comes to on the road
I tend to agree with O'Connor...

57:47.551 --> 57:49.929
...in terms of Kerouac's intention.

57:50.029 --> 57:54.246
Page 185, Dean says "they came into
the room and found me lying on the bed...

57:54.346 --> 58:00.381
"...my arms stretched out forever."
This is after three days, page 186.

58:00.481 --> 58:02.742
"They unwrapped the bandages and showed me.

58:02.842 --> 58:06.378
"The flesh, about half an inch,
was missing under the nail..."

58:06.478 --> 58:10.931
...which could be an interpretation
of a stake going through the hand.

58:11.319 --> 58:13.208
The 11 greeks?

58:13.985 --> 58:17.022
How about the 11 apostles,
Sal being the 12th...

58:17.122 --> 58:19.773
...which makes Dean...

58:25.330 --> 58:28.597
All right now, get the hell out of here
and go get some experience.

58:37.175 --> 58:40.660
Bill, thanks for letting me sit in.

58:41.346 --> 58:43.583
You're better than the rest of them.

58:44.383 --> 58:48.435
- You mean that?
- I told you not to ask me stupid questions.

58:50.054 --> 58:52.106
See you later, Bill.

59:02.233 --> 59:05.571
"I think about that night every day,
but still he haunts me.

59:05.671 --> 59:10.358
"He hovers over my bed at night
and whispers in my dreams.

59:10.942 --> 59:14.762
"I still have integrity.
What are you left with?"

59:15.481 --> 59:16.716
The end.

59:16.816 --> 59:20.019
I'd say that's a step up for Joey Epstein.

59:20.686 --> 59:23.552
I'd hate to see his early works.

59:24.856 --> 59:26.726
What are you reading now?

59:26.826 --> 59:30.161
Franzen. Although I...

59:30.261 --> 59:34.884
...did just come across
this really interesting writer...

59:35.534 --> 59:36.985
...Bill Oakland.

59:39.871 --> 59:41.403
So...

59:42.446 --> 59:47.460
- ...what did you think?
- I was pleasantly surprised.

59:47.979 --> 59:50.883
It certainly wasn't the worst I've ever read.

59:50.983 --> 59:54.286
You... know what this means, don't you?

59:54.386 --> 59:58.357
- No, what does this mean?
- You must have dinner with me tonight.

59:58.457 --> 59:59.825
What?

59:59.925 --> 01:00:03.496
Come with me to Brooklyn,
and I'll take you to Paris.

01:00:04.696 --> 01:00:05.831
Paris?

01:00:05.931 --> 01:00:08.934
Everybody knows that Brooklyn
is the new Paris.

01:00:09.034 --> 01:00:11.551
- Really?
- <i>Bien sur.</i>

01:00:11.651 --> 01:00:14.373
Well, it's been a long time
since I've been to Paris.

01:00:14.473 --> 01:00:16.507
- So?
- So.

01:00:17.108 --> 01:00:18.486
What do you say?

01:00:21.079 --> 01:00:23.131
Brooklyn it is then.

01:00:34.959 --> 01:00:36.428
Hello.

01:00:36.528 --> 01:00:38.345
Allow me.

01:00:41.866 --> 01:00:44.467
Chivalry is not dead among the blind.

01:00:46.604 --> 01:00:48.305
Milla...

01:00:48.506 --> 01:00:52.660
...may I have a vodka
on the rocks, and for you?

01:00:54.078 --> 01:00:57.365
- Just a glass of red wine. Thank you.
- Red wine.

01:01:00.752 --> 01:01:02.603
Thank you for coming.

01:01:03.488 --> 01:01:05.257
Thank you for inviting me.

01:01:05.357 --> 01:01:08.047
You're probably wondering
why I asked you to come to dinner.

01:01:08.147 --> 01:01:11.797
No, I was actually asking
myself why I said yes.

01:01:12.297 --> 01:01:15.634
Well, I am guilty of a crime...

01:01:15.734 --> 01:01:19.238
...that I would never forgive
someone else for committing.

01:01:19.338 --> 01:01:24.124
I judged a book by its cover
and I misjudged you.

01:01:24.675 --> 01:01:29.481
And in spite of your ridiculously
oversized diamond ring...

01:01:29.581 --> 01:01:31.253
...I was wrong about you.

01:01:31.353 --> 01:01:33.649
You're not at all...

01:01:33.749 --> 01:01:35.824
...what I thought you were.

01:01:37.622 --> 01:01:42.628
Well, I actually misjudged you as well.

01:01:43.228 --> 01:01:47.717
I said that you were self-centered,
narcissistic and blind...

01:01:48.017 --> 01:01:52.706
...and I realized that you're
self-centered, narcissistic, blind...

01:01:52.806 --> 01:01:54.655
...and a little charming.

01:01:56.741 --> 01:01:58.592
Thank you.

01:02:01.781 --> 01:02:03.850
Thank you, Wes.

01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:07.992
So maybe we can start over.

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:10.872
To starting over.

01:02:15.126 --> 01:02:18.164
Do you like to travel?
I love Paris. Do you love Paris?

01:02:18.264 --> 01:02:23.702
I do love Paris, in fact,
it's my favorite place in the whole world.

01:02:23.802 --> 01:02:28.389
I begged my father to take me
on my 13th birthday.

01:02:29.874 --> 01:02:33.879
And I got there and it felt
like this was home.

01:02:33.979 --> 01:02:37.182
And I was determined to live there.

01:02:37.282 --> 01:02:39.284
That was my plan.

01:02:39.384 --> 01:02:42.187
I was gonna go there, write poetry...

01:02:42.287 --> 01:02:45.133
...sit in cafes and smoke cigarettes.

01:02:46.090 --> 01:02:49.028
- Did you end up living there?
- No.

01:02:49.128 --> 01:02:50.978
Why not?

01:02:51.629 --> 01:02:54.430
Just... just life and...

01:02:55.129 --> 01:02:58.804
...you know, it just seemed
like it was a romantic notion...

01:02:58.904 --> 01:03:01.388
...of a teenage girl and...

01:03:03.173 --> 01:03:05.744
...and, you know, it didn't fit Mark's...

01:03:05.844 --> 01:03:08.414
...agenda of building an empire.

01:03:08.514 --> 01:03:12.332
'Cause for him, business is pleasure.

01:03:12.917 --> 01:03:14.721
And that's pretty much it.

01:03:15.421 --> 01:03:18.706
The cage with the golden bars.
I know it well.

01:03:20.625 --> 01:03:22.962
I never planned to stay in New York.

01:03:23.062 --> 01:03:27.029
I always thought I would end up
in Paris like the lost generation...

01:03:27.129 --> 01:03:31.618
...or better yet in some seaside
town in the south of France.

01:03:32.570 --> 01:03:37.079
And once I learned that you don't
need a lot of money to travel...

01:03:37.179 --> 01:03:38.810
...I was hooked.

01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:42.140
I went all over Europe
with very little in my pocket.

01:03:43.148 --> 01:03:47.820
Who cared if the bed was lumpy
or the bathroom was down the hall.

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:52.058
The cheese was splendid and the wine
was out of this world, so...

01:03:52.158 --> 01:03:54.008
...what more do you need?

01:03:55.226 --> 01:03:58.396
That truly sounds heavenly.

01:03:58.496 --> 01:04:00.515
Except for the lumpy bed.

01:04:08.106 --> 01:04:10.142
And here we are.

01:04:10.342 --> 01:04:14.713
How do you know this is where it's at?
That's amazing. Really impressive.

01:04:14.813 --> 01:04:17.783
- Hey, Bill, how ya doing?
- Well, hey, Frank.

01:04:17.883 --> 01:04:22.154
Frank, this is Suzanne. Suzanne, this is
Frank. Frank's the super of our building.

01:04:22.254 --> 01:04:24.256
How do you do?

01:04:26.457 --> 01:04:28.825
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.

01:04:28.925 --> 01:04:32.431
I tell people like it is
and you are a beautiful woman.

01:04:32.531 --> 01:04:36.035
In fact, the two of you look pretty
freaking beautiful together.

01:04:36.135 --> 01:04:39.204
Bill, what'd you do? The Botox.

01:04:40.605 --> 01:04:43.375
No, Frank, it's just a shave,
but I appreciate the thought.

01:04:43.475 --> 01:04:46.812
- Hey, no problem.
- Nice to meet you.

01:04:50.047 --> 01:04:52.866
- Quite a colorful character.
- Yes.

01:04:53.884 --> 01:04:58.089
Thank you for a really lovely evening.

01:04:58.189 --> 01:05:00.088
Where are you going?

01:05:00.759 --> 01:05:04.363
I'm... I'm gonna go home.

01:05:04.463 --> 01:05:07.324
Wait a minute, you came all this way,
and you're not at least curious...

01:05:07.424 --> 01:05:10.402
...to see what a blind man's
apartment looks like?

01:05:10.502 --> 01:05:13.625
Well, I didn't realize that it was different.

01:05:15.539 --> 01:05:17.390
Come on.

01:05:20.344 --> 01:05:22.162
Thank you.

01:05:22.847 --> 01:05:26.986
Can I get you something to drink?
Would you like a glass of wine?

01:05:27.086 --> 01:05:28.854
- Sure, that sounds lovely.
- White or red?

01:05:28.954 --> 01:05:32.372
- Red is perfect.
- Good, because all I have is red.

01:05:34.892 --> 01:05:37.562
Is this your office?

01:05:37.662 --> 01:05:39.212
Yes.

01:05:47.606 --> 01:05:49.742
You look good on the track.

01:05:49.942 --> 01:05:54.179
Well, it's how I put myself through school.

01:05:54.279 --> 01:05:56.748
Is this postcard from the south of France?

01:05:56.848 --> 01:05:59.818
Yes, it's from the Cote d'Azur,
my favorite place in the world.

01:05:59.918 --> 01:06:01.953
The town is called Eze.

01:06:05.223 --> 01:06:07.293
Your wife is very pretty.

01:06:07.993 --> 01:06:09.561
Thank you.

01:06:09.661 --> 01:06:11.317
No kids?

01:06:12.297 --> 01:06:14.063
No, I...

01:06:14.163 --> 01:06:16.426
...I realized that I...

01:06:16.526 --> 01:06:20.788
...couldn't be a good father
and good writer, so no kids.

01:06:22.206 --> 01:06:26.680
- How about yourself?
- We tried for a long time, but...

01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:30.230
...it didn't work.

01:06:34.919 --> 01:06:36.803
Here you are.

01:06:37.655 --> 01:06:39.557
Straight, 12 o'clock.

01:06:41.542 --> 01:06:43.393
Thank you.

01:06:44.162 --> 01:06:48.861
So tell me, dinner at the French
restaurant, the stroll...

01:06:50.268 --> 01:06:52.161
...the wine...

01:06:52.261 --> 01:06:56.864
...I don't know, is this part
of the normal Bill Oakland routine?

01:06:59.377 --> 01:07:04.231
Actually, I haven't had a woman
up to this apartment in...

01:07:05.712 --> 01:07:07.517
...five years.

01:07:09.453 --> 01:07:12.083
Well, I guess then I should be honored.

01:07:13.824 --> 01:07:16.628
- May I ask you a question?
- Sure.

01:07:16.728 --> 01:07:18.597
I can see shapes.

01:07:18.697 --> 01:07:21.935
I can make out your skin tone, but...

01:07:23.835 --> 01:07:25.704
...what do you look like?

01:07:26.204 --> 01:07:29.308
I have brown hair, hazel eyes.

01:07:29.408 --> 01:07:32.859
No, what do you look like?

01:07:40.482 --> 01:07:43.570
Why don't you see for yourself?

01:08:11.732 --> 01:08:13.954
I can see that you're beautiful.

01:08:17.254 --> 01:08:19.856
And I can see that you're fragile.

01:08:24.194 --> 01:08:26.835
I wanna see the way that you see.

01:08:28.098 --> 01:08:29.983
How you see me.

01:09:02.198 --> 01:09:04.844
I can see that you're fragile too.

01:10:02.493 --> 01:10:04.044
Suzanne?

01:10:10.368 --> 01:10:11.918
Suzanne?

01:10:23.547 --> 01:10:25.098
Hello?

01:10:28.185 --> 01:10:29.755
Okay.

01:10:30.303 --> 01:10:32.498
Yeah, okay.

01:10:33.491 --> 01:10:36.528
I have a reservation at Versailles at 7:00.
You think I'll make that?

01:10:36.628 --> 01:10:39.814
- Yes.
- All rise.

01:10:53.577 --> 01:10:58.934
Due to the untimely death of our key
witness, the government has no choice...

01:10:59.034 --> 01:11:02.706
...but to drop all charges
against Mark Dutchman.

01:11:21.337 --> 01:11:22.901
Mr. Dutchman, excuse me!

01:11:23.001 --> 01:11:27.346
Mr. Dutchman, what do you think happened
to your former associate Howard Cunningham?

01:11:27.446 --> 01:11:30.281
Howard Cunningham told lies
about me and I'll never know why.

01:11:30.381 --> 01:11:33.206
But let's get one thing straight. I am...

01:11:34.706 --> 01:11:38.941
...I am still grieving over the freak
accident that took my friend's life.

01:11:39.041 --> 01:11:40.884
That's all I have to say.

01:11:43.161 --> 01:11:45.199
Sir, did you have any comments?

01:11:49.066 --> 01:11:51.359
Didn't I tell you that
it was going to work out?

01:11:52.401 --> 01:11:54.220
You did.

01:11:56.607 --> 01:11:58.425
Home sweet home.

01:12:08.018 --> 01:12:09.903
What's wrong?

01:12:12.523 --> 01:12:14.998
What really happened to Howard?

01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:18.112
He got hit by a bus.

01:12:21.131 --> 01:12:22.782
Karma's a bitch.

01:12:27.171 --> 01:12:30.824
I had nothing to do with Howard's death.

01:12:41.018 --> 01:12:42.829
How is your blind man?

01:12:47.391 --> 01:12:50.560
I guess he'll be sad now he
doesn't get to sit in his little room...

01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:52.877
...jerking off about my wife.

01:12:58.502 --> 01:13:00.589
Thought you'd be happy about that.

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:04.891
Of course I am.

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.795
I'm gonna take a bath.

01:13:31.716 --> 01:13:32.703
Yeah.

01:13:35.042 --> 01:13:37.464
So they dropped all the charges.

01:13:40.327 --> 01:13:44.213
So this is it? This is your last session?

01:13:46.616 --> 01:13:49.427
I don't know how I could justify coming.

01:13:51.188 --> 01:13:54.829
Well, you could volunteer.
You do charity work all the time.

01:13:59.163 --> 01:14:01.180
You're not a charity case.

01:14:17.981 --> 01:14:20.201
You're not coming back, are you?

01:14:20.852 --> 01:14:22.669
Please come back.

01:14:28.025 --> 01:14:30.443
- Please come back.
- No.

01:14:36.066 --> 01:14:37.917
Oh, yeah.

01:14:41.809 --> 01:14:43.803
You're welcome, Mr. Dutchman.

01:15:03.694 --> 01:15:06.865
- What are you doing here?
- Just in the neighborhood.

01:15:06.965 --> 01:15:08.466
Did Mark have you follow me?

01:15:08.566 --> 01:15:10.869
I don't know what you're talking about,
Mrs. Dutchman.

01:15:10.969 --> 01:15:13.397
What, you feeling guilty or something?

01:15:16.673 --> 01:15:20.178
- What's it gonna take?
- Not to tell him?

01:15:20.278 --> 01:15:22.382
I don't know if I can put a price on that.

01:15:23.982 --> 01:15:25.262
Try.

01:15:42.466 --> 01:15:44.284
Not tonight.

01:15:46.103 --> 01:15:48.111
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:15:50.274 --> 01:15:52.091
I'm tired.

01:16:12.763 --> 01:16:14.299
Hey.

01:16:14.599 --> 01:16:17.502
- What'd you find?
- Nothing.

01:16:20.003 --> 01:16:23.424
- Nothing?
- I mean, she reads to him.

01:16:25.575 --> 01:16:28.128
- That's it?
- That's it, boss.

01:16:32.549 --> 01:16:34.867
Are you lying to me, Landry?

01:16:35.787 --> 01:16:37.217
No.

01:16:40.190 --> 01:16:41.893
You're fired.

01:16:41.993 --> 01:16:43.243
Fired?

01:16:44.695 --> 01:16:46.447
You got a hearing problem?

01:16:48.532 --> 01:16:50.569
You sure that's a good idea?

01:16:51.269 --> 01:16:52.637
I'm sorry?

01:16:52.773 --> 01:16:56.026
Well, considering everything I know about
you and given your current standing...

01:16:56.126 --> 01:16:59.301
...with the US attorney,
are you sure that's a good idea?

01:17:00.810 --> 01:17:03.748
Now, that's the kind of spirit
I like to see in my team.

01:17:03.848 --> 01:17:07.245
Maybe you're not such a pussy after all.
There may be hope for you yet.

01:17:07.345 --> 01:17:09.087
Thank you, Mr....

01:17:09.187 --> 01:17:12.523
Fuck, fuck.

01:17:14.625 --> 01:17:16.657
No, boss.

01:17:16.757 --> 01:17:19.364
If I even dream, you ratted me out...

01:17:19.464 --> 01:17:23.478
...I'll take your fucking head off
with this golf club. You hear me?

01:17:23.578 --> 01:17:25.223
- Are we clear?
- Yes, sir.

01:17:25.323 --> 01:17:29.155
Now I'm gonna ask you one more time.

01:17:30.107 --> 01:17:34.281
Is my wife having an affair
with the blind man?

01:17:36.079 --> 01:17:38.385
- Is she?
- Yes!

01:17:40.183 --> 01:17:42.436
Yeah, yes!

01:17:48.759 --> 01:17:50.310
Fuck.

01:17:54.398 --> 01:17:57.869
"He soaked in the intoxication
of her scent...

01:17:57.969 --> 01:18:01.539
"...before diving headfirst
into her holiness.

01:18:01.639 --> 01:18:04.542
"Sending her into a paroxysm of pleasure...

01:18:04.642 --> 01:18:06.882
"...she did not know existed...

01:18:06.982 --> 01:18:10.849
"...before his gentle touch."

01:18:13.784 --> 01:18:15.988
You fuck as good as you write?

01:18:17.088 --> 01:18:19.325
Who do I have the pleasure of addressing?

01:18:20.725 --> 01:18:22.614
Mark Dutchman.

01:18:22.714 --> 01:18:24.611
Suzanne's my wife.

01:18:25.195 --> 01:18:28.032
Dutchman's not your real last name, is it?

01:18:28.332 --> 01:18:32.036
- What makes you say that?
- Your voice has a ring of Queens to it.

01:18:32.136 --> 01:18:37.035
Polished, but you can never take all the
Far Rockaway out of there, now can you?

01:18:38.009 --> 01:18:41.060
- And where are you from?
- Brooklyn.

01:18:42.646 --> 01:18:44.883
You got balls for a blind man.

01:18:45.783 --> 01:18:47.377
I'll give you that.

01:18:53.957 --> 01:18:56.728
What is it you do for my wife?

01:18:56.828 --> 01:19:00.431
- I don't wanna fight with you, Mark.
- No, I wanna know.

01:19:00.531 --> 01:19:03.961
I need to know. What is it you do?

01:19:05.452 --> 01:19:07.830
You really need me to spell that out for you?

01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:13.325
I'm gonna say once, only once.

01:19:14.478 --> 01:19:17.296
Do not see Suzanne again.

01:19:17.914 --> 01:19:19.799
That's fine.

01:19:20.517 --> 01:19:23.021
Just don't ask me to keep my hands off her.

01:19:27.090 --> 01:19:29.594
You think you can say that shit to my face...

01:19:29.694 --> 01:19:32.961
...and I'm gonna give you a pass
because you're blind?

01:19:34.232 --> 01:19:35.786
No.

01:19:36.213 --> 01:19:38.336
No, Mark, no.

01:19:38.436 --> 01:19:40.862
I... I want you to...

01:19:41.334 --> 01:19:44.374
...treat me just like any other guy
that's banging your wife.

01:19:46.743 --> 01:19:48.779
What the fuck is going on in here?

01:19:49.257 --> 01:19:51.097
Get your hands off me.

01:19:52.582 --> 01:19:54.586
What's wrong with you?

01:19:55.406 --> 01:19:57.236
Get out of here.

01:20:03.493 --> 01:20:05.512
Remember what I said.

01:20:10.767 --> 01:20:13.052
You alright, Bill? Hey.

01:20:21.378 --> 01:20:23.263
You remember this?

01:20:29.386 --> 01:20:33.410
I had never been as happy in my life
as I was in that moment.

01:20:39.096 --> 01:20:40.831
You love him?

01:20:40.931 --> 01:20:43.810
- Mark.
- Tell me.

01:20:46.803 --> 01:20:48.688
I don't know.

01:20:53.210 --> 01:20:55.151
I forgive you.

01:20:56.279 --> 01:20:58.762
Just end this thing with him.

01:20:59.350 --> 01:21:01.223
Oh, I don't know if I forgive you.

01:21:02.586 --> 01:21:04.409
I've made mistakes.

01:21:04.989 --> 01:21:07.640
Everyone makes mistakes. Even you.

01:21:08.925 --> 01:21:10.762
But we can change.

01:21:11.162 --> 01:21:12.979
I've changed.

01:21:18.401 --> 01:21:21.872
You know what I thought of
when I was in prison?

01:21:21.972 --> 01:21:24.039
You know what got me through?

01:21:25.575 --> 01:21:27.126
You.

01:21:27.611 --> 01:21:30.299
The thought of coming home and holding you.

01:21:31.182 --> 01:21:33.033
That's the only thing that held me together.

01:21:33.133 --> 01:21:35.405
Is that why you had me followed?

01:21:40.407 --> 01:21:45.883
What do I have to do to keep the one
uncorrupted thing left in my life?

01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:50.034
Just tell me what you need, Suzanne. Tell me.

01:21:50.134 --> 01:21:52.739
And I swear to God I'll give it to you.

01:21:53.638 --> 01:21:55.707
You're my everything, baby.

01:21:56.207 --> 01:21:59.226
You know that, everything.

01:22:02.178 --> 01:22:04.034
I know...

01:22:04.134 --> 01:22:06.972
...I know you think you love him...

01:22:07.072 --> 01:22:09.120
...but let me tell you something.

01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:11.732
Bill...

01:22:12.882 --> 01:22:14.938
...Bill's a short story.

01:22:15.722 --> 01:22:17.576
I'm your novel.

01:22:18.128 --> 01:22:20.205
Novels are work sometimes...

01:22:20.305 --> 01:22:23.201
...but the short story,
it doesn't go on to the next day.

01:22:23.501 --> 01:22:25.418
It doesn't endure.

01:22:25.902 --> 01:22:29.273
It's fun for a while, but then fun runs out.

01:22:29.373 --> 01:22:33.446
Then you realize,
there's no new chapter to turn to.

01:22:36.012 --> 01:22:38.595
I don't know what this is anymore.

01:22:39.450 --> 01:22:41.267
I don't know you.

01:22:45.321 --> 01:22:47.140
Don't leave me.

01:22:47.791 --> 01:22:51.224
Don't, I can't live without you.

01:22:53.062 --> 01:22:54.913
I can't.

01:22:56.666 --> 01:22:58.706
Please don't leave me.

01:23:00.137 --> 01:23:03.874
Please don't leave me. Not when
my whole fucking world is falling apart.

01:23:03.974 --> 01:23:05.688
Baby, please.

01:23:06.075 --> 01:23:07.960
Please, baby.

01:23:09.713 --> 01:23:11.598
I need you so much.

01:23:14.751 --> 01:23:18.208
And I need you. I need you.

01:23:20.089 --> 01:23:21.940
I need you.

01:23:43.346 --> 01:23:47.232
- Suzanne, is that you?
- Yes, yes, it is.

01:23:48.418 --> 01:23:50.139
Please come in.

01:23:53.423 --> 01:23:57.928
You are not going to believe
the kind of day I've had.

01:23:58.028 --> 01:24:01.747
I actually was inspired to write.

01:24:02.665 --> 01:24:04.517
That's great.

01:24:05.134 --> 01:24:07.305
What happened to your face?

01:24:07.405 --> 01:24:13.460
Nothing, I... I bumped into something
when I was doing something.

01:24:15.845 --> 01:24:18.090
May I offer you...

01:24:19.532 --> 01:24:21.137
...a glass of champagne?

01:24:21.752 --> 01:24:26.591
I'm sorry, Bill, I... I can't do this.

01:24:26.691 --> 01:24:29.594
You can't drink champagne
in the middle of the day?

01:24:29.694 --> 01:24:32.530
No, I... this can't go any further.

01:24:32.630 --> 01:24:35.691
I'm married. It's...

01:24:36.417 --> 01:24:38.500
...it's not right, it's...

01:24:39.203 --> 01:24:41.221
It's only wrong...

01:24:41.321 --> 01:24:43.212
...if you stay with him.

01:24:44.741 --> 01:24:46.811
Do you still love him?

01:24:46.911 --> 01:24:49.327
- He's my husband.
- That's not an answer...

01:24:50.627 --> 01:24:52.125
...Suzanne.

01:24:54.551 --> 01:24:56.778
Yes, I still love him.

01:25:03.827 --> 01:25:05.279
I don't believe you.

01:25:10.567 --> 01:25:14.620
I am sorry, Bill. I have to... I have to go.

01:25:26.116 --> 01:25:27.632
Suzanne...

01:25:28.302 --> 01:25:30.119
...good to see you.

01:25:31.855 --> 01:25:33.673
Nice to have you around.

01:25:39.629 --> 01:25:41.232
- Frank!
- Yeah?

01:25:41.332 --> 01:25:44.017
- Which way did she go?
- To the left.

01:25:46.636 --> 01:25:48.187
Suzanne!

01:25:56.513 --> 01:25:58.164
Suzanne!

01:26:00.917 --> 01:26:02.388
Suzanne!

01:26:08.925 --> 01:26:13.445
Jesus. Buddy? Buddy? Buddy, are you okay?

01:26:13.643 --> 01:26:16.663
- You okay? Hey, come on.
- Come on, come on. Come on, come on.

01:26:18.301 --> 01:26:20.170
Hey, you're looking to get yourself killed?

01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:23.441
- You got him, you got him?
- Yeah, I got him. Breathe, okay.

01:26:23.541 --> 01:26:26.934
- Frank? Is that you, Frank?
- Yes, it's me. It's me, Bill, I'm right here.

01:26:27.034 --> 01:26:29.713
I'm right here. You got hit by a cabbie.

01:26:29.913 --> 01:26:32.315
- My stick?
- I got your stick right here.

01:26:32.415 --> 01:26:35.101
- Don't move, don't move. I'm right here, yeah.
- Buddy, you okay?

01:27:13.957 --> 01:27:15.520
<i>Hey.</i>

01:27:15.941 --> 01:27:17.744
<i>It's me calling.</i>

01:27:17.995 --> 01:27:22.281
<i>I just wanted to tell you to be nice tonight.</i>

01:27:23.232 --> 01:27:27.100
<i>You've been a grouch
for the last three nights and...</i>

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:30.045
<i>...I'm feeling kinda fragile, so...</i>

01:27:30.445 --> 01:27:34.660
<i>...please just be nice tonight, okay?</i>

01:27:35.712 --> 01:27:37.529
<i>I love you.</i>

01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:45.155
Michelle, this cannot come
as a surprise to you...

01:27:45.255 --> 01:27:47.287
...but I want a...

01:28:38.525 --> 01:28:40.412
What's going on here?

01:28:41.812 --> 01:28:43.629
I lost something.

01:28:45.648 --> 01:28:47.184
I took it.

01:28:47.284 --> 01:28:48.934
What?

01:28:50.186 --> 01:28:51.737
Here.

01:28:55.191 --> 01:28:58.362
Nothing Left To Win Or Lose.
When I was cleaning your apartment.

01:28:58.462 --> 01:29:01.732
I would have told you, but I knew
you wouldn't let me read it.

01:29:01.832 --> 01:29:04.902
- That's because it's not finished.
- But it's not far.

01:29:05.002 --> 01:29:06.819
Goddammit!

01:29:07.637 --> 01:29:10.948
- How dare you?
- Are you gonna finish it?

01:29:11.508 --> 01:29:14.560
Yeah, I'm gonna finish it.

01:29:14.977 --> 01:29:17.314
- I'm gonna finish it.
- What are you, what are you...

01:29:17.414 --> 01:29:19.665
No, stop!

01:29:20.282 --> 01:29:21.986
- Let it burn, Gavin!
- No!

01:29:22.086 --> 01:29:23.919
Let it burn!

01:29:31.828 --> 01:29:34.678
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Why don't you mind your own business?

01:29:34.778 --> 01:29:38.602
Why don't you get off your ass and do
what you were put on this earth to do?

01:29:38.702 --> 01:29:41.505
It's time to move on.
Enough with the self pity shit!

01:29:41.605 --> 01:29:43.974
You're blocked. Change up the scenery.

01:29:44.074 --> 01:29:45.876
I'm blind, Gavin.

01:29:46.476 --> 01:29:49.762
The scenery doesn't change... ever.

01:29:50.313 --> 01:29:53.463
- Everyone makes their excuses.
- Come on.

01:29:53.563 --> 01:29:56.720
But it's only the losers
who quit because it's not fair.

01:29:56.820 --> 01:29:59.624
- Please.
- Nobody said it had to be fair.

01:30:00.424 --> 01:30:03.694
- All right, so?
- Well, you wrote that.

01:30:05.328 --> 01:30:08.533
If you wanna give up, that's your business.

01:30:09.333 --> 01:30:13.144
But if you need help in getting your
life together, then you give me a call.

01:30:46.235 --> 01:30:48.706
<i>Do we all cave eventually?</i>

01:30:49.106 --> 01:30:52.442
<i>Convince ourselves
not to take the final leap?</i>

01:30:52.542 --> 01:30:55.147
<i>Just when our dreams are within reach.</i>

01:30:58.381 --> 01:31:03.075
<i>The opposite of love
is not hate, but indifference.</i>

01:31:04.087 --> 01:31:07.706
"He saw that the spring had sprung...

01:31:07.806 --> 01:31:13.081
"...the food was gone. But no mouse.

01:31:13.663 --> 01:31:15.966
"You see, the mouse would come
in the middle of the night.

01:31:16.066 --> 01:31:19.937
"She called for my grandfather. "Papa," he
came quickly! "What's the matter?" He asked.

01:31:20.037 --> 01:31:22.873
"There's a mouse in our house," she yelled.
"But the mouse was gone.

01:31:22.973 --> 01:31:26.165
"Don't worry," said papa. The next morning...

01:31:26.265 --> 01:31:29.562
<i>However the Nemesis of love is fear.</i>

01:31:33.015 --> 01:31:35.501
<i>Fear creeps into you.</i>

01:31:36.052 --> 01:31:38.003
<i>Builds up walls.</i>

01:31:38.588 --> 01:31:40.841
<i>Traps you inside yourself.</i>

01:31:42.558 --> 01:31:45.995
<i>Fear strangles you, slowly...</i>

01:31:46.095 --> 01:31:47.598
<i>...subtly...</i>

01:31:47.698 --> 01:31:51.984
<i>...until one day there's
nothing left to win or lose.</i>

01:32:00.242 --> 01:32:03.073
<i>Nothing left but the thirst...</i>

01:32:03.173 --> 01:32:05.664
<i>...for the one drink you don't have.</i>

01:32:09.051 --> 01:32:11.557
<i>Nothing left, but the memory...</i>

01:32:11.657 --> 01:32:15.459
<i>...of the one pair of lips
that could have saved your soul.</i>

01:32:15.759 --> 01:32:19.814
<i>If only fear hadn't kept you
from taking the leap.</i>

01:32:31.874 --> 01:32:35.112
Okay, that's great. Thank you so much.

01:32:35.212 --> 01:32:38.282
- All right, bye.
- How are you?

01:32:38.382 --> 01:32:40.918
Oh, Mrs. Dutchman.
I didn't know you were reading today.

01:32:41.018 --> 01:32:43.220
No, no, I'm not.

01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:45.823
And please call me Suzanne.

01:32:45.923 --> 01:32:48.173
Okay, Suzanne.

01:32:48.591 --> 01:32:52.244
Do you know where he is, Ella?

01:32:52.929 --> 01:32:57.021
Bill? No, not a clue, he just vanished.

01:32:58.935 --> 01:33:03.986
But by the way, it was really nice
to see you reading to those kids.

01:33:04.674 --> 01:33:06.725
They really loved you.

01:33:16.485 --> 01:33:18.036
Hey.

01:33:19.055 --> 01:33:22.192
- Suze, hi.
- What are you doing here?

01:33:22.292 --> 01:33:23.754
I...

01:33:23.854 --> 01:33:28.266
...I was just in the neighborhood
and I thought I'd drop by to...

01:33:28.528 --> 01:33:30.532
...see if you want to have lunch.

01:33:34.003 --> 01:33:36.288
That Chanel No. 5?

01:33:37.039 --> 01:33:39.258
Every now and then it's fun.

01:33:55.021 --> 01:33:56.885
Honey pot.

01:34:02.999 --> 01:34:06.018
He likes five minute eggs, not three.

01:34:14.410 --> 01:34:17.753
Hey, I was just gonna call you.

01:34:17.853 --> 01:34:19.883
Wanna grab some lunch?

01:34:20.083 --> 01:34:22.334
Don't... don't do that.

01:34:22.752 --> 01:34:25.971
- What's wrong?
- I'm done.

01:34:27.289 --> 01:34:29.128
I am...

01:34:30.897 --> 01:34:32.280
...really done.

01:34:35.031 --> 01:34:39.084
- Are we really gonna go through this again?
- No, we're not.

01:34:42.038 --> 01:34:44.089
Deanna will love that.

01:34:48.044 --> 01:34:49.933
All I ever wanted...

01:34:50.565 --> 01:34:52.393
...was for you to be happy.

01:35:37.952 --> 01:35:40.713
- Hello, Bill.
- <i>Bonjour,</i> Jean.

01:36:17.333 --> 01:36:19.302
Hello, Bill. How are you today?

01:36:19.402 --> 01:36:22.559
<i>Ã‡a va Marie, et vous?</i> How is your little dog?

01:36:22.659 --> 01:36:25.222
Still peeing on the sofa,
but what can you do?

01:36:25.322 --> 01:36:28.556
Well, either kill him
or learn to live with it.

01:36:28.656 --> 01:36:31.314
- Like men?
- Well, not all men.

01:36:31.414 --> 01:36:33.450
All of them.

01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:37.169
- The usual?
- The usual, Marie. <i>S'il vous plait.</i>

01:37:11.854 --> 01:37:14.024
You think today is the day?

01:37:14.524 --> 01:37:16.842
Today is as good as any day.

01:37:17.643 --> 01:37:20.129
That's what you say every day.

01:37:24.803 --> 01:37:26.313
Bill...

01:37:26.757 --> 01:37:29.581
...why do you never offer a glass to me?

01:37:33.042 --> 01:37:35.693
Because it's for me.
