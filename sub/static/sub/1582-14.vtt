00:45.990 --> 00:47.257
D'oh!

00:59.737 --> 01:00.770
D'oh!

01:12.650 --> 01:13.950
- Whoa!
- What the...?

01:20.024 --> 01:21.157
Mmm, mail.

01:21.191 --> 01:22.959
Oh, "urgent notice." Hmm.

01:22.993 --> 01:24.994
If it's not final,
who cares?

01:28.165 --> 01:29.299
Donkey!

01:30.367 --> 01:32.302
There you go.

01:42.112 --> 01:43.846
If it's important,
they'll call back.

01:45.215 --> 01:46.749
Mom! Dad!

01:46.784 --> 01:48.818
The retirement home
lost its license

01:48.852 --> 01:50.186
and Grampa has
nowhere to live!

01:50.220 --> 01:52.021
D'oh!

01:52.056 --> 01:55.725
Oh! That man can't remember
anything except our number!

01:59.330 --> 02:01.364
Get in
the car, Dad.

02:01.398 --> 02:03.366
Look who's here,
the big dummy!

02:03.400 --> 02:05.501
You do know
I'm a doctor now.

02:05.536 --> 02:08.104
Yeah! M.D.!
Major Dummy!

02:08.138 --> 02:09.771
Grampa, what happened?

02:09.806 --> 02:11.708
This place
is unlivable.

02:11.742 --> 02:15.678
My contract clearly promised
"barely livable."

02:15.713 --> 02:18.181
Yeah, well, we're closing down
Codger Stadium here

02:18.215 --> 02:19.849
until they fix up
their violations.

02:19.883 --> 02:21.684
And there
are a lot of 'em.

02:27.091 --> 02:28.825
Mannequin nurses.

02:33.197 --> 02:35.865
Like I said,
lot of violations.

02:35.899 --> 02:39.335
Oh! I guess Grampa's
coming home with us.

02:39.370 --> 02:40.837
Unless...

02:40.871 --> 02:43.706
what about that nice
dog boarding place?

02:43.741 --> 02:45.041
The really good one,

02:45.075 --> 02:46.876
where they each have
their own dog partner.

02:46.910 --> 02:48.845
No kennels!
You're right.

02:48.879 --> 02:50.213
Bad idea, bad idea.

02:50.247 --> 02:52.048
Should we just,
you know, drive by

02:52.082 --> 02:54.217
and take a look
at the place...?

02:55.252 --> 02:56.919
Bad idea. Bad.

03:01.058 --> 03:03.760
When are your relatives
going to be here?

03:03.794 --> 03:06.863
Can I be honest with you?
They're not.

03:06.897 --> 03:09.198
We're all alone
in this world.

03:09.233 --> 03:12.568
All I have left is a phone
message from my late wife.

03:12.603 --> 03:16.372
Pick up the phone, big shot!
I know you're there!

03:18.242 --> 03:20.877
You're both coming home with us.

03:20.911 --> 03:21.911
You mean it?

03:21.945 --> 03:23.012
Mm-hmm.

03:23.046 --> 03:24.947
Ah, just let me
say good-bye

03:24.982 --> 03:26.883
to my girlfriend.

03:26.917 --> 03:28.951
Don't get fat.

03:30.988 --> 03:33.656
Honey, Grampa
is the closest thing I have

03:33.690 --> 03:37.693
to a father, and I love him,
but three octogenorous?

03:37.728 --> 03:40.463
Homie, Homie,
we'll be old someday.

03:40.497 --> 03:41.931
Speak for yourself.

03:41.965 --> 03:44.467
Glug-glug-glug.
Chomp-chomp-chomp.

03:44.501 --> 03:47.470
Beep...

03:49.072 --> 03:51.908
My lifestyle
is my retirement plan.

03:51.942 --> 03:53.176
Oh!

03:55.679 --> 03:57.313
And don't
forget my ripple.

03:57.347 --> 03:58.915
You're not taking your ripple.

03:58.949 --> 04:00.983
Without ripple,
I never would have had you.

04:01.018 --> 04:02.285
Ripple's your real daddy.

04:05.689 --> 04:08.291
This is gonna be a swell
flophouse, sister.

04:08.325 --> 04:10.293
So, where should we
park our pills?

04:10.327 --> 04:11.661
What pills?

04:19.503 --> 04:21.070
Aah!

04:21.103 --> 04:23.439
Don't worry, Marge.
It's childproof.

04:28.879 --> 04:30.279
Oh, oh...

04:30.314 --> 04:33.182
Homer, how are we
doing with those cots?

04:33.217 --> 04:35.251
Uh... come on, boy.

04:35.285 --> 04:37.086
Your job is to guide me.

04:37.120 --> 04:39.689
Well, I really think you
should watch your temper.

04:39.723 --> 04:41.858
I mean down the stairs,
you stupid kid!

04:41.892 --> 04:43.659
Stupid kid?
Do you really think

04:43.694 --> 04:45.328
that's the way
we should communicate?

04:45.362 --> 04:47.597
You just want to see
your old man trip and fall.

04:47.631 --> 04:50.633
Well, sorry to
disappoint you, lad, but...

04:50.667 --> 04:53.102
What the...?
D'oh! D'oh! Ooh!

04:53.136 --> 04:55.338
Not what I was hoping
for, but it'll do.

04:58.675 --> 05:00.109
Okay, boys, shower up.

05:00.143 --> 05:02.144
And I better hear
some towels snapping.

05:03.747 --> 05:05.281
Muntz, what is wrong
with you?

05:05.315 --> 05:07.149
Now, you get undressed
in front of everyone

05:07.184 --> 05:08.351
that's staring at you.

05:11.154 --> 05:14.123
Is that
women's underwear?

05:14.157 --> 05:16.492
My mom can't afford
to buy me clothes,

05:16.527 --> 05:19.028
so I wear her hand-me-downs.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.835
Muntz, there's a kind of poverty
that toughens you up,

05:25.869 --> 05:28.304
but this... is sad.

05:30.407 --> 05:32.375
Hey, leave him alone.

05:32.409 --> 05:34.944
I, too, know the pain
of hand-me-down underwear.

05:34.978 --> 05:37.013
My dad buys
the underpants gorillas wear

05:37.047 --> 05:38.814
during monkey shows.

05:38.849 --> 05:42.184
So if you're gonna laugh
at Nelson, laugh at me, too.

05:45.589 --> 05:47.657
Simpson, I won't
forget this.

05:47.691 --> 05:51.928
From now on, you and I
are as tight as whiteys.

07:00.330 --> 07:03.065
I've had it up to here with
those freeloading wrinkle bags.

07:03.100 --> 07:05.801
They pee all night,
they cry all day,

07:05.836 --> 07:08.971
and every time they use
the computer, the font is huge.

07:09.006 --> 07:10.573
Aah!

07:10.607 --> 07:13.075
Dad, did it ever occur to
you that we're learning

07:13.110 --> 07:15.478
how to take care of you
when you're older

07:15.512 --> 07:17.647
by watching the way
you treat Grampa?

07:17.681 --> 07:19.982
Have you seen how he
treats my grampa?

07:20.017 --> 07:21.250
Never visits him.

07:21.284 --> 07:23.586
Never even acknowledges
his existence.

07:23.620 --> 07:25.655
Your grampa's alive?

07:25.689 --> 07:26.822
Oh, yeah.

07:26.857 --> 07:28.758
Okay...

07:28.792 --> 07:32.762
Well, can you please
be nicer to our grampa?

07:32.796 --> 07:35.164
For me? I love Grampa.

07:35.198 --> 07:38.100
You may not realize it,
but he's a treasure.

07:38.135 --> 07:41.303
Keep it down in there,
you jabbermouths!

07:41.338 --> 07:43.305
I'm trying
to watch C-SPAN2.

07:43.340 --> 07:44.607
Please?

07:44.641 --> 07:46.275
Okay.

07:46.309 --> 07:47.877
You know, I love him, too.

07:47.911 --> 07:49.145
In a manly way.

07:49.179 --> 07:50.413
That never shows itself.

07:51.815 --> 07:53.215
Now, we're
going to need

07:53.250 --> 07:55.184
three hearing aid
batteries,

07:55.218 --> 07:57.386
all different
and hard to get.

07:57.421 --> 08:00.823
And this has to be in the
fridge, next to the butter.

08:00.857 --> 08:02.391
And the butter has to be open.

08:02.426 --> 08:04.393
Oh, I'll see what I can do.

08:04.428 --> 08:06.696
I can handle them
from now on, Marge.

08:06.730 --> 08:08.297
Gentlemen,
I've been thinking.

08:08.331 --> 08:11.033
My glorious youth and beauty
won't last forever.

08:11.068 --> 08:12.735
Someday, when the leaves
have turned

08:12.769 --> 08:15.805
and the moon has broken apart
into chunks of floating cheese,

08:15.839 --> 08:17.707
I will be old.

08:17.741 --> 08:19.542
What's your point, pound cake?

08:19.576 --> 08:23.145
I'm hoping we can
find a way to coexist.

08:23.180 --> 08:24.213
What did he say?

08:24.247 --> 08:26.348
He wants to see if ghosts exist.

08:26.383 --> 08:27.650
Ooh, they do.

08:27.684 --> 08:29.552
My Uncle Bill is here right now.

08:29.586 --> 08:31.721
Oh, Bill, Bill, I'm so sorry

08:31.755 --> 08:34.323
I wasn't a very good
ladder holder.

08:34.357 --> 08:36.225
That's all right.
Enough about that.

08:36.259 --> 08:38.527
Did the clock ever get wound?

08:41.264 --> 08:43.799
This can only be good.

08:48.271 --> 08:51.340
This family's had a lot of hoods
put over their heads.

08:52.542 --> 08:55.077
Uh, Chief, something
about that looks fishy.

08:55.112 --> 08:56.946
Aw, Lou, you got a
suspicious mind, you know?

08:56.980 --> 08:59.014
You remind me of
that Elvis song.

08:59.049 --> 09:00.216
Uh, uh, "Clambake."

09:00.250 --> 09:01.917
You know, 'cause
you open your yap

09:01.952 --> 09:03.686
when things get hot.
"Clambake."

09:06.882 --> 09:09.831
All right, take off his hood.

09:09.832 --> 09:12.066
Where am I?
Our secret place.

09:12.101 --> 09:14.135
The empty swimming pool
from the country club

09:14.170 --> 09:15.870
that closed down rather
than let women in.

09:17.640 --> 09:21.910
Now, enter the stolen
bicycle graveyard.

09:29.251 --> 09:32.954
We've decided to make you
an honorary bully.

09:32.988 --> 09:34.722
Bestow upon him

09:34.757 --> 09:37.992
the necklace
of unknown retainers.

09:39.428 --> 09:41.329
Um... thanks,

09:41.363 --> 09:43.932
but I'm not sure
I want to be a bully.

09:43.966 --> 09:45.166
It's too late.

09:45.201 --> 09:46.835
You've seen our faces.

09:49.939 --> 09:53.575
Wow, never had breakfast
at 6:00 in the morning before.

09:53.609 --> 09:55.977
I love yakking
at the manager

09:56.011 --> 09:57.745
while he's trying
to unlock the door.

09:57.780 --> 10:00.582
Now we'll talk about
dead people you never met

10:00.616 --> 10:03.484
while we get
a little exercise.

10:04.720 --> 10:05.987
When does
the exercise start?

10:06.021 --> 10:08.590
This is it.
Yeah, we're mall-walking.

10:08.624 --> 10:10.291
Oh, my God.

10:10.326 --> 10:11.960
This counts as exercise?

10:11.994 --> 10:15.263
I'm barely moving
and I'm smelling Cinnebun.

10:15.297 --> 10:17.966
Sometimes you have to
wait till you're 38

10:18.000 --> 10:19.767
to discover
who you really are.

10:19.802 --> 10:23.271
I'm a 79-year-old man.

10:23.305 --> 10:25.840
Son, welcome to the club.

10:29.511 --> 10:32.146
Now, say something
pathetic.

10:32.181 --> 10:34.515
Uh, okay, um...

10:34.550 --> 10:36.351
Oh, I can't.

10:36.385 --> 10:38.386
That's my boy.

10:41.056 --> 10:42.891
I-25.

10:42.925 --> 10:44.826
What letter?
"I."

10:44.860 --> 10:46.861
What number?
25.

10:46.896 --> 10:47.862
What game?

10:47.897 --> 10:48.863
Bingo!

10:48.898 --> 10:50.265
Damn it!

10:51.533 --> 10:54.168
Who's the icebox
pie, Abe?

10:54.203 --> 10:55.970
Your younger
brother?

10:56.005 --> 10:57.572
My son--
but he's taken.

10:57.606 --> 10:59.507
Well, I'm not
surprised--

10:59.541 --> 11:02.243
the way he tears
into corn on the cob.

11:02.278 --> 11:04.979
Now, Mildred,
he's a married man.

11:05.014 --> 11:08.483
You can't see the ring
because his finger's too fat.

11:08.517 --> 11:13.121
Join the party, Abe-- there's
plenty of room in my bed...

11:13.155 --> 11:16.491
once they take
the railings down.

11:16.525 --> 11:19.928
I said beat it!
For the time being.

11:19.962 --> 11:23.097
Now, Homer, you stay away
from those red-door hoochies.

11:23.132 --> 11:25.900
They're just trying to get a
chicken dinner out of you.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.368
Hmm.

11:27.403 --> 11:28.903
Well, thanks for
the chicken dinner.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.872
How did you know
I wanted one?

11:30.906 --> 11:32.941
All you gals

11:32.975 --> 11:35.076
like chicken dinners, Marge.

11:35.110 --> 11:36.377
Don't call me a gal.

11:36.412 --> 11:38.379
Makes me feel like
I'm your mother.

11:38.414 --> 11:40.548
I better turn up the heat.

11:40.582 --> 11:42.450
It's 82 degrees.

11:42.484 --> 11:44.118
Huh?

11:44.153 --> 11:46.120
Are you wearing sock garters?

11:46.155 --> 11:47.789
Young lady, in my day...

11:47.823 --> 11:49.390
Your day is my day!

11:49.425 --> 11:51.025
We're the same age!

11:51.060 --> 11:54.395
You're turning
into your father.

11:56.565 --> 11:58.466
You won't feel
so bollixed

11:58.500 --> 12:01.202
once my Social Security
checks start coming!

12:01.236 --> 12:03.905
They're not coming
for another 29 years.

12:03.939 --> 12:07.041
Did your ear lobes get longer?

12:07.076 --> 12:08.843
Falsies.

12:16.752 --> 12:18.753
Whoa.
A tweet from Chester!

12:18.787 --> 12:20.154
Who's Chester?

12:20.189 --> 12:21.622
"Who's Chester"?

12:21.657 --> 12:23.992
Just the most legendary
bully of all.

12:24.026 --> 12:27.662
They say he once
wedgied a kid in half.

12:27.696 --> 12:29.230
Whoa.

12:29.264 --> 12:30.565
He's calling a
bully summit

12:30.599 --> 12:31.599
for next
Saturday night.

12:31.633 --> 12:33.001
Hey, isn't that
the same night

12:33.035 --> 12:35.269
the U.S. figure skating
finals are on?

12:36.405 --> 12:38.773
They've been promoting it
like hell!

12:39.808 --> 12:42.076
Excuse us, we're
looking for owls.

12:42.111 --> 12:43.244
Screech or hoot?

12:43.278 --> 12:44.412
Either one's fine.

12:44.446 --> 12:45.780
That was an order!

12:45.814 --> 12:47.682
Screech!
Screech!

12:48.884 --> 12:51.085
Where's the Lord
of the Fries?

12:51.120 --> 12:54.756
Actually, Homer got up early
to count and sort pills.

12:54.790 --> 12:57.658
Then he called the police when
a Frisbee landed on our lawn.

12:57.693 --> 13:00.194
Then he went to the drugstore
for an egg cream,

13:00.229 --> 13:01.863
but he only
brought a nickel.

13:03.165 --> 13:04.999
I didn't mind that he grew bald.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.868
I didn't mind that he got fat.

13:06.902 --> 13:08.703
I didn't mind
that he got fatter.

13:08.737 --> 13:12.306
But no one told me
he'd get older than me.

13:12.341 --> 13:13.941
Oh...

13:13.976 --> 13:15.276
Say it, honey--

13:15.310 --> 13:17.512
you're no longer
attracted to him.

13:22.818 --> 13:24.752
Maybe.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.561
It's on tonight,
and everyone who ever took

13:33.595 --> 13:36.164
anyone's lunch money is there.

14:04.093 --> 14:06.561
All you boppers
going to the park tonight,

14:06.595 --> 14:08.996
make sure you're not packin'.

14:09.031 --> 14:11.466
We don't want any...
"accidents."

14:13.202 --> 14:15.470
<i>Ay, caramba.</i>

14:16.538 --> 14:19.507
How'd you babies
get here?

14:19.541 --> 14:22.510
Did your mommy bring you?

14:22.544 --> 14:23.544
Yes.

14:23.579 --> 14:24.779
Nelson!

14:24.813 --> 14:26.681
I might have to move
the trailer house

14:26.715 --> 14:28.516
while you're gone.
Look for me downhill.

14:28.550 --> 14:30.451
I ain't got much gas.

14:30.486 --> 14:32.153
Smell you later.

14:33.222 --> 14:35.223
Hey, my old weasels!

14:35.257 --> 14:37.425
How's Shelbyville Elementary?

14:37.459 --> 14:39.026
Not bad, not bad.

14:39.061 --> 14:41.662
We've ruined picture day
three years in a row.

14:42.998 --> 14:44.966
Chester! Chester!

14:45.000 --> 14:48.336
They say the day
of the bully is over.

14:48.370 --> 14:50.371
Popular music condemns us.

14:50.405 --> 14:54.408
Documentary filmmakers
expose our craft.

14:54.443 --> 14:57.111
And cyber-bullying
has taken away

14:57.146 --> 14:59.814
the warmth
of human punching.

14:59.848 --> 15:04.819
But I say to you, the day
of the bully has just begun!

15:04.853 --> 15:06.621
Can you dig it?!

15:06.655 --> 15:08.723
Hey, why are you
doing this?

15:08.757 --> 15:10.958
Because I don't want
to sit around

15:10.993 --> 15:15.129
like Prince Charles waiting
for the queen to die!

15:15.797 --> 15:16.764
Can...

15:16.798 --> 15:19.133
you... dig... it?!

15:20.235 --> 15:21.435
Ooh, I can
totally dig it.

15:22.471 --> 15:24.405
Chester's been shot!

15:27.276 --> 15:29.243
This kid did it!

15:29.278 --> 15:31.679
His sling is still warm!

15:32.781 --> 15:34.415
Get that boy!

15:34.449 --> 15:37.351
And his friend, the kid
with the lady's underpants!

15:37.386 --> 15:39.220
How does everyone know?

15:42.811 --> 15:45.580
To all you boppers out there,
be on the lookout

15:45.614 --> 15:49.924
for a sling-daddy who
took down our main man Chester.

15:49.925 --> 15:53.128
This is KBLY,
your source for bully news,

15:53.162 --> 15:54.863
weather and sports.

15:54.897 --> 15:58.266
100% supported
by money taken from nerds.

15:58.300 --> 16:00.201
I can't believe
you did that, Bart.

16:00.236 --> 16:01.736
I don't even
want to sit

16:01.771 --> 16:03.972
on the same side
of this car with you.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.540
I'm just doing it
for balance.

16:05.574 --> 16:07.075
I didn't shoot him!

16:07.109 --> 16:09.411
Oh, yeah? Well, why'd
you bring your slingshot?

16:09.445 --> 16:11.413
I don't know. I feel
naked without it.

16:11.447 --> 16:12.814
Yeah, I get that.

16:12.848 --> 16:14.816
That's how I feel
about my eyebrow ring.

16:16.685 --> 16:18.553
The only way out
is on the subway,

16:18.587 --> 16:20.288
past everyone
else's territory.

16:20.322 --> 16:22.857
We'll just have to wait
it out here until we...

16:26.295 --> 16:27.662
We're gonna have to jump for it!

16:29.298 --> 16:32.734
No! I lost my flip-flop!

16:32.768 --> 16:34.102
Just keep moving!

16:39.108 --> 16:41.075
Oh. Well, well, well.

16:41.110 --> 16:44.446
Looks like youse and me may be
up here for a while, huh?

16:45.881 --> 16:48.216
There.

16:50.953 --> 16:52.454
Yippee!

16:52.488 --> 16:55.190
Aw, damn it! I just had
to get her parkour lessons

16:55.224 --> 16:56.458
for her birthday.

16:59.695 --> 17:02.764
You'll have to get past
the S.A.T. Preppers!

17:02.798 --> 17:06.367
790 assault, 780 battery.

17:06.402 --> 17:09.671
I didn't say to begin.

17:13.909 --> 17:17.779
<i>Word on the street</i>
<i>is that the S.A.T. Preppers</i>

17:17.813 --> 17:19.180
<i>failed the test.</i>

17:19.214 --> 17:21.950
The Springfield bullies
are still at large.

17:21.983 --> 17:24.385
That's right, yeah, so,
uh, give yourselves up.

17:24.420 --> 17:27.121
Um, if I put on the radio,
can I hear myself?

17:28.557 --> 17:30.525
Wow.

17:30.559 --> 17:32.527
That's crazy.

17:32.561 --> 17:34.329
Whoo, whoo.

17:34.363 --> 17:36.197
Hello, Lou.

17:42.671 --> 17:45.306
I only have a-pennies.

17:45.341 --> 17:46.574
<i>Uno... due...</i>

18:05.394 --> 18:06.861
For Springfield!

18:11.033 --> 18:12.567
Save yourselves...!

18:12.601 --> 18:15.870
Today we are all
Nelson Muntz.

18:15.905 --> 18:18.439
Haw, haw.

18:26.882 --> 18:29.217
Springfield. We're safe.

18:29.251 --> 18:31.019
I'm gonna kiss
the ground.

18:31.053 --> 18:32.120
Loser!

18:32.154 --> 18:34.055
You're gay for the ground.

18:34.089 --> 18:36.124
Well, you're gay
for homophobia.

18:36.158 --> 18:40.094
Wow. You just made me
gay for tolerance.

18:47.069 --> 18:49.237
Bul-lies...

18:49.271 --> 18:52.540
come out to play-ay...

18:52.575 --> 18:54.409
Bul-lies...

18:54.443 --> 18:57.879
come out to play-ay...

18:57.913 --> 19:00.348
Oh, no!
He's got three bottles!

19:00.382 --> 19:05.119
Clinky, clinky...

19:05.154 --> 19:08.957
I know a place that serves an
<i>early</i> early bird breakfast.

19:08.991 --> 19:10.992
Steak and eggs for 50 cents,

19:11.026 --> 19:13.728
<i>and</i> it was 40 years ago.

19:13.762 --> 19:15.730
Oh, boy.
Yeah. Ah...

19:15.764 --> 19:17.298
Oh, my God!
I know that kid!

19:17.333 --> 19:18.666
We got to help him.

19:18.701 --> 19:21.169
Oh, I'd love to,
but, uh, I'm sure

19:21.203 --> 19:24.238
that it's some sort
of a holiday for me.

19:24.273 --> 19:27.308
Fine! Your generation did its
part when it won World War II

19:27.343 --> 19:30.011
and created <i>The Rockford Files.</i>
I t th one.

19:31.246 --> 19:34.182
It's so hard running in sand.

19:34.216 --> 19:35.950
No! No!

19:35.985 --> 19:39.020
I can't be old yet.
I won't let the ravages of time

19:39.054 --> 19:41.956
catch up with me till I'm 52!

19:42.992 --> 19:44.592
Ow! Ow!

19:44.627 --> 19:46.361
No!

19:46.395 --> 19:48.997
Um, I've never
really been in a fight.

19:51.233 --> 19:53.534
Now, let's
go home, son.

20:02.511 --> 20:05.480
How did I get here?

20:11.714 --> 20:13.915
Ooh, what's your hurry?

20:13.949 --> 20:16.150
We got ten minutes between
the kids falling asleep

20:16.185 --> 20:17.485
and the old guys waking up.

20:17.519 --> 20:19.253
Go, go, go!

20:19.288 --> 20:21.155
I hear smooching!
