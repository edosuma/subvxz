00:04.500 --> 00:06.860
- Do you know who that man is?
- I can't help you.

00:06.900 --> 00:09.060
- Do you have his name?
- Wang Pengfei.

00:09.100 --> 00:13.180
- What do you think was in his shopping bags?
- If I find out, you'll be the first to know.

00:13.220 --> 00:16.379
Do you have a personal number for
Maria Dubiecki? - Why? What's going on?

00:16.420 --> 00:18.420
It was fraud on a massive scale.

00:28.020 --> 00:30.636
- Hey, your girlfriend's on TV.
- "This is not just a Native issue."

00:30.660 --> 00:33.076
- "It's an American issue."
- She's not my girlfriend anymore.

00:33.100 --> 00:36.140
- I just need to borrow your phone.
- OK.

00:36.180 --> 00:39.540
- How did you get this number?
- I need to know where he is.

00:39.580 --> 00:43.220
Do you have any idea what we're waking up
to tomorrow? I mean, do you get that?!

00:43.260 --> 00:46.180
"Donald Trump
is now the president elect

00:46.220 --> 00:49.300
of the United States of America!"

00:49.340 --> 00:51.580
Lee, you have to find him
before they do.

00:51.620 --> 00:54.100
Is he in danger?
Mr Tang?

00:54.140 --> 00:55.140
Argh!

00:55.180 --> 00:58.020
I need to hear from you
by tomorrow night.

00:59.820 --> 01:00.700
Hi.

01:00.740 --> 01:02.940
Hey. Did you read the article yet?

01:02.980 --> 01:07.140
"Er... I'm sorry. I... I just...
Things are crazy right now."

01:07.180 --> 01:10.580
- I'll read it right away, OK?
- "I need you to get it in a newspaper."

01:10.620 --> 01:12.620
OK? It's already been
firewalled here,

01:12.660 --> 01:15.580
- but the Western press...
- "Zhang Lin, I've been fired."

01:15.620 --> 01:18.500
So I can send it on,
but right now I can't... - "What?"

01:18.540 --> 01:21.060
- Why didn't you tell me?
- "Er, it's OK."

01:21.100 --> 01:22.900
It's temporary.

01:22.910 --> 01:26.100
Listen, I got another call coming in.
I'm gonna call you right back, OK?

01:29.900 --> 01:33.220
- Hi, Senator. How are you?
- "Oh, I'm just wonderful, Lee."

01:33.650 --> 01:36.820
I found what you're looking for.
My assistant will meet you today,

01:36.860 --> 01:39.380
3:00 PM,
the Quik Park, East 98th Street.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.420
"If you're late, he won't wait."

02:23.580 --> 02:26.020
- Oh, good. You're still here.
- Where else would I be?

02:26.060 --> 02:29.220
- You've got my phone.
- Oh. Sorry.

02:30.220 --> 02:32.740
Thank you.
I just picked up a new one.

02:32.780 --> 02:36.260
Listen, I'm getting the address
at three. I need you to come with me.

02:36.300 --> 02:38.540
I'm gonna spook him
if I go on my own.

02:41.860 --> 02:44.580
- The Tank Man?
- I have a presentation in two hours.

02:44.620 --> 02:46.780
- Where were you last night?
- I told you.

02:46.820 --> 02:49.020
Oh, emergency babysitting.
Don't let me be that woman.

02:49.060 --> 02:51.636
Why would you want me to be that
fucking woman? She is so annoying.

02:51.660 --> 02:53.660
Yeah, OK, OK.

02:53.700 --> 02:57.500
- I... I went to see Senator Dubiecki.
- OK. And you lied because...

02:57.540 --> 02:59.740
Because it wasn't, like,
my finest hour,

02:59.780 --> 03:03.420
and I don't need a moral lecture now,
especially not from you. - Excuse me?

03:03.460 --> 03:07.390
No, I didn't mean - Go on.
- Oh, please! This is so stupid,

03:07.400 --> 03:09.880
you know? I mean, this is just
not important. We have to go!

03:09.890 --> 03:13.860
- How am I not important?
- No, you are! You are important!

03:13.900 --> 03:15.940
It's just that I need you
to come with me right now,

03:15.980 --> 03:18.220
and instead you're gonna be spending
the rest of the day,

03:18.260 --> 03:20.540
like, photoshopping
Martin Luther King into car ads!

03:23.220 --> 03:27.260
Wait. I'm sorry.
Tess, I didn't mean that. I'm sorry.

03:27.300 --> 03:29.500
I cannot believe
I fell for your shit.

03:29.540 --> 03:33.380
Wait. - Skipping down Broadway
like some prick in a musical!

03:33.420 --> 03:35.556
- What is wrong with me?
- He's in danger, and I... I...

03:35.580 --> 03:37.996
- I didn't mean that. I just...
- Let me know. I hope you find him.

03:38.020 --> 03:41.740
Really, really do. - Please!
- I am not insignificant

03:41.780 --> 03:45.220
because I never stepped in front of
a fucking tank. - Please don't go.

03:45.260 --> 03:47.780
Please. Please don't go.

05:16.590 --> 05:18.460
I have Wang Pengfei's address.

05:20.260 --> 05:23.420
- I don't have it yet, but I will.
- How?

05:23.460 --> 05:25.700
Maria.

05:26.440 --> 05:28.600
She decided to help me out.

05:28.640 --> 05:30.440
OK.

05:31.460 --> 05:34.860
So, what do you want? - I want you
there with me when I find him.

05:34.900 --> 05:36.916
- I don't want him to freak out again.
- Lee, come on!

05:36.940 --> 05:39.620
It is the morning after
the apocalypse. I can't go AWOL.

05:39.660 --> 05:43.100
Please. Please. I don't have the...

05:44.100 --> 05:47.540
...you know, the bedside manner.
He's already scared.

05:47.580 --> 05:49.860
- Well, how about tomorrow?
- I think he's in danger.

05:49.900 --> 05:52.020
- It'll be too late, Mel.
- I can't do it.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.460
I have got 800 words to write,

05:54.500 --> 05:57.100
and they can't all be,
"Move to Canada."

05:57.140 --> 05:58.940
"I was very lucky."

06:12.540 --> 06:15.380
"You've reached
the Melania Trump Euthanasia Fund."

06:15.420 --> 06:18.420
"How may we murder you?"
- Hey. This is Lee Berger.

06:18.460 --> 06:20.900
I'm looking for Alex Sguerra.

06:22.940 --> 06:24.220
Hey, what do you want?

06:26.840 --> 06:30.400
I know where he is.
You got a car, right?

06:59.180 --> 07:02.620
Let's go, Liuli! Go!

10:43.200 --> 10:45.640
Can I point out...

10:45.680 --> 10:47.640
They LOVE to shop.

10:49.480 --> 10:51.280
They love to SHOP.

10:51.320 --> 10:53.320
They love... to shop!

10:56.160 --> 10:58.240
Are we all set?

10:58.280 --> 11:02.200
I think so.
Got my, er, clicker, so...

11:02.240 --> 11:04.800
I wanted to tell you what a pleasure
it's been working with you

11:04.840 --> 11:07.880
over the last months.
- Oh, thanks, Zhao! You, too.

11:07.920 --> 11:11.320
Other collaborations we have had,
we have felt very... pestered.

11:11.360 --> 11:13.600
- Too much noise.
- Right.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.920
- Sorry. What kind of...
- Oh, you know.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.240
Human rights, democracy,
blah-blah-blah.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.920
Everyone wants to tell you
what's wrong with China.

11:21.960 --> 11:25.080
No-one wants to hold the mirror up
to themselves.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.120
I wanted to commend you.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.080
Thanks.

11:33.080 --> 11:35.560
OK. So, we are late to the party.

11:35.600 --> 11:38.480
Um, the road to the Chinese market
is already well trodden,

11:38.520 --> 11:41.240
and it is littered with
the companies who have failed.

11:41.280 --> 11:46.280
Uber, Mattel, eBay, Best Buy. These
are not mom-and-pop operations.

11:46.320 --> 11:48.320
But they made the mistake
of thinking

11:48.360 --> 11:51.520
that China was looking over
the fence, wanting to BE America,

11:51.560 --> 11:54.440
when nothing could be further
from the truth.

11:55.440 --> 11:58.440
OK. So, I am gonna show you
a portfolio

11:58.480 --> 12:01.920
of seven customer segments.

12:01.960 --> 12:04.520
And they are united by one thing.

12:05.520 --> 12:08.000
They love to shop.

12:08.040 --> 12:10.640
We only have to look at this picture
to know that.

12:10.680 --> 12:13.760
What's this an image of? Protest.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.960
But more than that,
this is the moment

12:16.000 --> 12:19.080
when China exchanged
the dream of democracy

12:19.120 --> 12:22.840
for an economic miracle.
And, by the way, can I point out,

12:22.880 --> 12:25.280
the Tank Man has been...

12:25.320 --> 12:27.520
shopping!

12:27.560 --> 12:30.440
Er, the most iconic image
to come out of China,

12:30.480 --> 12:34.560
and at its heart is a man
who has just been to the store.

12:34.600 --> 12:38.640
To buy what? I mean, rice,
a newspaper, dry... dry...

12:40.920 --> 12:43.680
...duck tongue.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.800
OK, let's look at the segments.

12:45.840 --> 12:49.240
Um, the first I am calling
the rural dreamer,

12:49.280 --> 12:51.600
in their 30s... Sorry. Er...

12:51.640 --> 12:55.640
Late teens to mid-20s. They have,
um, a high brand awareness,

12:55.680 --> 12:57.960
er, minimal free time.
Lots of their money is sent home.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.080
Um, a high brand awareness. They...
Oh.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.760
Er...

13:05.040 --> 13:06.960
Dedique?

13:08.880 --> 13:11.280
Excuse us for one moment.

13:15.160 --> 13:17.360
- I'll get the other...
- OK. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.040
She's just gone to, um...
Actually, you know,

13:23.080 --> 13:26.880
while we're waiting...
let's talk about...

13:26.920 --> 13:29.080
the Luddite shopper,
seeing as we're...

13:29.120 --> 13:33.480
Mm. The Luddite shopper.
The Luddite shopper is, er...

13:33.520 --> 13:35.520
Um... It's a...

13:37.160 --> 13:39.120
I'm sorry. Just, I, um...

13:46.440 --> 13:49.200
Well, for a start,
it takes me five years

13:49.240 --> 13:51.720
to build an accurate segmentation,
and you have me on a...

13:51.760 --> 13:54.560
on a six-month contract,
and China is moving faster

13:54.600 --> 13:56.696
than we can collect the data.
I mean, this is a nation

13:56.720 --> 13:59.680
that's gone from famine to SlimFast
in one generation,

13:59.720 --> 14:02.040
which is amazing.
But also, that's... It's...

14:02.080 --> 14:04.800
It's not a safe speed
to be moving at, cos...

14:04.840 --> 14:07.240
We're gonna be selling into a...
into a market

14:07.280 --> 14:11.080
where we can't see the data, where
none of our customer information

14:11.120 --> 14:14.200
is protected from the state,
and every single purchase made

14:14.240 --> 14:18.480
on one of our cards will be recorded
by the government, which...

14:18.520 --> 14:21.840
I'm sorry, but I do...
I do find that... scary.

14:21.880 --> 14:24.160
Because you're gonna be getting
into bed with someone

14:24.200 --> 14:26.280
that you don't understand.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.960
Which... It just seems a bit...

14:29.000 --> 14:31.480
lunatic. Because,
you know, this is the future.

14:33.160 --> 14:36.160
It's the next hundred years,
and we don't understand, and...

14:37.160 --> 14:40.880
I think... that might be a problem.

14:42.280 --> 14:43.920
Right?

15:11.320 --> 15:13.400
OK. Here we go.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.920
- Hello.
- "It's David Barker. Where are you?"

15:58.960 --> 16:01.040
Get out of the car.
I'm right behind you.

16:01.080 --> 16:03.400
"I'm not driving.
I'll be there in one minute."

16:19.560 --> 16:21.600
Fuck off!

16:21.640 --> 16:23.720
Hey.

16:23.760 --> 16:25.760
Jesus. Come on.

16:33.560 --> 16:37.440
You're 40 minutes late.
Do you have it? - You first.

16:45.440 --> 16:49.680
- How do I know this is the only copy?
- You're just gonna have to trust me.

16:51.520 --> 16:54.520
Well, look,
Maria is not a perfect woman.

16:54.560 --> 16:57.720
She was born to a pair of immigrants
in the back of a Ford sedan,

16:57.760 --> 17:00.160
and now she's a senator.
And she represents the interests

17:00.200 --> 17:02.960
of nearly 20 million people,
and she represents them very well

17:03.000 --> 17:06.040
for the most part. She has the right
for this to be forgotten. - I agree.

17:06.079 --> 17:10.920
- Are you finished, cos...
- 1062 Stetson Avenue, Edison.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.640
Wait!

17:12.680 --> 17:14.720
Edison, New Jersey?

17:20.920 --> 17:22.960
I thought you'd been kidnapped!
You OK?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.640
Yeah.

17:28.540 --> 17:29.700
Go.

17:51.840 --> 17:53.840
This friend who gave you
the tip-off...

17:53.880 --> 17:55.960
He was, er, a protester

17:56.000 --> 17:58.160
who's lost his wife in the massacre.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.440
You think the numbers are right
on that?

18:00.480 --> 18:03.200
I heard some stuff about how
the Western press inflated them.

18:03.240 --> 18:07.120
I was there. It was a government
murdering its own citizens.

18:07.160 --> 18:10.160
- At least we're not there yet.
- Sure, we are.

18:10.200 --> 18:13.240
We just don't round 'em all up
in one place, is all.

18:13.280 --> 18:16.480
.."in this country
that have to go out."

18:16.520 --> 18:18.800
"We'll get them out.
We're going to secure the border"...

18:18.840 --> 18:21.200
Sguerra... Is that Mexican?

18:22.680 --> 18:24.000
Uh-huh.

18:38.080 --> 18:40.640
- That's our man.
- Wang Penfei.

18:40.680 --> 18:41.920
Ready?

18:43.560 --> 18:45.280
Mm-hm.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.400
- Hey. Can I get a manicure?
- Yes, sure.

19:06.440 --> 19:08.720
Er, can I go with this lady?

19:08.760 --> 19:10.320
Sure.

19:11.320 --> 19:13.480
Pick your colour.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.400
Can I talk to you about something?

19:29.440 --> 19:31.760
- Your boyfriend?
- No, not...

19:31.800 --> 19:33.960
I mean, we can get into that,
but, um...

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
First up, I just wanna tell you
I'm not a cop.

19:37.040 --> 19:39.320
I'm not with immigration.
I'm a journalist.

19:39.360 --> 19:41.960
I'm not gonna do anything to harm
you or your husband.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.560
I just wanna ask you about
Wang Penfei.

19:44.600 --> 19:48.000
Your hands are so dry.
I need lotion.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.680
You know,
if Wang Penfei was your husband,

20:13.720 --> 20:15.760
you'd be entitled to asylum
in the US.

20:15.800 --> 20:18.960
He'd be a political refugee.
It'd be a better life for you.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.040
I don't know
who you're talking about.

20:40.720 --> 20:42.640
Hey! Hey!

20:55.040 --> 20:56.560
Hey.

20:57.560 --> 21:00.120
Excuse me. Wang Penfei?

21:00.160 --> 21:02.400
Don't worry, don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

21:02.440 --> 21:05.680
Is your name Wang Penfei? It's OK!
I just wanna talk to you!

21:08.880 --> 21:12.280
- The man in this picture... Is it you?
- We call the police. You get out!

21:12.320 --> 21:15.160
You're illegal. You're not gonna call
the police. Listen to me.

21:15.200 --> 21:18.480
You're in danger.
I'm trying to help you. - No. Stop.

21:18.520 --> 21:20.440
No filming!

21:22.600 --> 21:26.120
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey! I'm not
gonna... I'm not gonna hurt you.

21:26.160 --> 21:29.080
- This is getting out of control.
- This man in the photo. Alex, shut up!

21:29.120 --> 21:31.400
Not me, not me!

21:31.440 --> 21:33.360
My brother!

21:33.400 --> 21:34.960
What?

21:37.000 --> 21:39.480
The Tank Man?

21:39.520 --> 21:41.920
Are you sure?

21:41.960 --> 21:46.240
- Look. Look. Look, this man.
- I don't know about this man.

21:47.240 --> 21:51.320
- But you just said...
- Not my brother, this man.

21:51.360 --> 21:55.280
No, this man here.
The soldier in the tank.

21:55.320 --> 21:59.400
He was my brother. Unknown hero.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.320
Argh!

22:18.160 --> 22:20.400
Are you OK?

22:22.560 --> 22:25.000
Where's your brother now?

22:25.040 --> 22:27.920
He was executed.

22:27.960 --> 22:30.120
But... But he was a soldier.

22:30.160 --> 22:32.160
He wouldn't run him over.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.680
The Party were angry.

22:34.720 --> 22:37.160
Everyone looks at the man
with the shopping bag.

22:37.200 --> 22:40.080
Nobody ever remembers
the man in the tank.

22:40.120 --> 22:42.400
That man was my brother,

22:42.440 --> 22:45.440
and he was very brave.

22:50.640 --> 22:51.840
OK.

22:55.900 --> 22:58.600
Wait, wait, wait. Don't run.

22:58.640 --> 23:00.840
Don't run!

23:01.280 --> 23:02.880
Don't run, don't run!

23:02.920 --> 23:05.480
Don't run!
- Get on the floor! - OK.

23:05.520 --> 23:07.840
Not armed! Not armed! Not armed!
It's a camera.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.880
Put it down on the ground.
Do what they say.

23:09.920 --> 23:12.000
Get down! Get on the floor.
DON'T RUN!

23:12.040 --> 23:14.480
DO NOT RUN! NO!

23:16.360 --> 23:20.640
Don't run! Let go of him!
He didn't do anything. Let him go!

23:20.680 --> 23:23.200
Let go! Let him go! Argh!

23:37.360 --> 23:40.000
This is my country, you asshole!

23:42.280 --> 23:44.640
No!

23:56.800 --> 23:59.040
Was he legal?

23:59.440 --> 24:02.920
- I can't discuss that.
- No, but... will he be deported?

24:05.080 --> 24:07.600
- I would say so.
- Because he's in danger, you know?

24:07.640 --> 24:09.840
- People looking for him.
- Don't worry.

24:09.880 --> 24:13.040
We're not gonna let him out of our
sight until he gets on that plane.

24:13.080 --> 24:15.680
Wanna follow me, please?

24:15.720 --> 24:18.280
Got some people who wanna ask you
a few more questions.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.120
What's she doing here?

24:23.160 --> 24:26.280
This woman's been following me. She's
working for the Chinese government!

24:26.320 --> 24:29.000
Lee...
we're not interested in Mr Wang.

24:29.040 --> 24:32.000
We're looking for you.
I'm Agent Patterson.

24:32.040 --> 24:35.720
This is Agent Hodgkiss.
Department of Homeland Security.

24:35.760 --> 24:39.560
- So... you think I'm a terrorist?
- You're a domestic terrorist, yes.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.680
Excuse me?!

24:44.200 --> 24:46.840
We'd like to know what
you can tell us about this person.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.960
Leila? She's my ex-girlfriend.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.080
We understand she's planning
a major protest next year.

24:53.080 --> 24:55.080
What do you know about that?

24:57.280 --> 24:59.680
- I don't know anything.
- Well, then, we'd like to know

24:59.720 --> 25:02.080
what kind of deal you wanna make.
- What do you mean, deal?

25:02.120 --> 25:05.120
Aside from any charges the owner of
the salon may wish to bring,

25:05.160 --> 25:08.240
we have historic evidence
of inciting a riot, rioting,

25:08.280 --> 25:10.600
conspiracy to riot,
and destruction of property.

25:10.640 --> 25:13.800
Wait. What? When?

25:13.840 --> 25:18.000
That was a year ago!
I was covering the protest!

25:18.040 --> 25:23.120
I even identified myself to
the police officers as a journalist!

25:23.160 --> 25:25.680
A civilised society can't allow
vandalism to be permitted

25:25.720 --> 25:27.720
under the guise of
civil disobedience.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.120
It's not a crime to be on the street.

25:30.160 --> 25:32.600
It's not a crime to raise your voice.

25:32.640 --> 25:36.800
You've visited a website promoting
anti-capitalist protest 12 times,

25:36.840 --> 25:39.920
and liked two pages
belonging to known agitators.

25:39.960 --> 25:42.840
You're Facebook friends with
six people we've already charged.

25:42.880 --> 25:45.600
How did you know that?

25:46.600 --> 25:49.240
You know what? Fine. Charge me.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.840
- I'll pay the fine.
- The total sentence for these charges

25:52.880 --> 25:55.000
is 60 years in jail.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.680
Or... there's the other way.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.720
- What?
- You're a photographer.

26:00.760 --> 26:04.280
- We just want you to...
- Document from the inside.

26:04.320 --> 26:06.560
Anything big,
we'd appreciate a heads-up.

26:06.600 --> 26:11.160
- To inform, you mean?
- You can use whatever word you like.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.320
What do you wanna do?

26:19.200 --> 26:21.240
Charge me.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.400
- I'm sorry?
- Charge me!

26:24.400 --> 26:26.520
Bail's been posted.
You're free to go right now.

26:26.560 --> 26:29.080
You'll get a letter
with your court date soon.

26:29.120 --> 26:32.240
You need to let us know
if you intend to leave the country.

26:32.480 --> 26:33.800
OK.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.400
Thanks.

26:36.740 --> 26:39.220
Wait. Who posted it?

26:43.960 --> 26:46.120
Nice nose-job.

26:46.360 --> 26:48.600
You posted my bail?

26:49.600 --> 26:51.600
I did.

26:54.840 --> 26:57.440
You wanna tell me...

26:57.480 --> 27:00.000
why Senator Dubiecki's office
cancelled my access

27:00.040 --> 27:02.160
to the Clinton press conference
today?

27:07.560 --> 27:09.680
Why would I know anything about that?

27:09.720 --> 27:12.520
Cos after Maria's office called,
I called Maria.

27:13.720 --> 27:15.800
Maria put me on hold.

27:16.800 --> 27:19.600
She had me listening to
Handel's fucking Water Music

27:19.640 --> 27:22.760
for a full nine minutes,
and when I finally got through,

27:22.800 --> 27:25.240
she was awful frosty with me.

27:26.240 --> 27:29.440
So I say to her, "What's this
with the Clinton conference?"

27:29.480 --> 27:31.480
"Why am I in
the fucking ejector seat?"

27:31.520 --> 27:35.120
Except I didn't curse.
I was very calm, very breezy.

27:36.120 --> 27:38.120
But she wasn't.

27:38.160 --> 27:40.240
She was not breezy.

27:40.280 --> 27:43.520
Fucking Arctic wind
coming down the line.

27:43.560 --> 27:45.680
And you know what she said to me?

27:45.720 --> 27:50.760
She said, "Ask...
your fuckweasel photographer."

27:51.760 --> 27:55.160
One of the... the most eloquent
orators of her generation

27:55.200 --> 27:58.960
uses the word "fuckweasel",
and hangs up on me.

28:00.520 --> 28:02.720
What did you do to her, Lee?!

28:03.720 --> 28:05.720
- What the hell did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

28:05.760 --> 28:08.600
I... I... I just greased the...

28:10.960 --> 28:14.880
I mean, whatever. I... - Well, I hope
your greasy whatever was worth it!

28:14.920 --> 28:19.080
How dare you come into my home
and lie to my face?!

28:19.120 --> 28:22.800
How dare you treat the truth
as an inconvenience?

28:22.840 --> 28:24.840
How many times have I defended you?!

28:24.880 --> 28:27.000
How many times
have I tried to scrape

28:27.040 --> 28:29.040
some off the mud off your name?

28:29.080 --> 28:33.000
Now, two days after an election,
you fuck me in the ass!

28:33.040 --> 28:35.120
I'm sorry, Mel.

28:39.040 --> 28:41.120
- I was just trying to...
- No!

28:41.160 --> 28:43.600
Your intentions are irrelevant.

28:43.640 --> 28:46.120
This happened.

28:46.160 --> 28:51.400
And now I am in the middle of
a shit-show of your making.

28:52.760 --> 28:55.760
Lee, I'm serious.
This is not a drill.

28:57.160 --> 29:01.040
You and I... we're done.

29:02.360 --> 29:04.680
I hope you go fuckin' blind.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.600
Just one second.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.800
"They have been marching
from Union Square."

29:32.840 --> 29:35.360
.."all these people.
They're really"...

29:35.400 --> 29:37.440
Take your possessions from the box,
sir.

29:37.480 --> 29:39.760
.."Union Square, and they've walked
up Fifth Avenue."

29:39.800 --> 29:44.080
"Maybe 40 blocks is how far
we've marched with them,

29:44.120 --> 29:46.520
up to here."

29:59.980 --> 30:02.540
- I need to call Leila.
- I called her already.

30:02.580 --> 30:05.220
They charged her too.
- What she say? Is she all right?

30:05.260 --> 30:08.100
She said you're a middle-class white
guy. You're probably gonna be OK.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.100
So that's good.

30:10.140 --> 30:12.740
I think I'm gonna need a lawyer,
Frank.

30:16.100 --> 30:18.180
I think that's true.

30:25.100 --> 30:30.340
"That name that you gave me...
Wang Penfei was a soldier."

30:30.380 --> 30:32.500
He was driving the tank.

30:32.540 --> 30:34.820
Yes, I know.

30:34.860 --> 30:38.060
You knew that? All along?

30:38.100 --> 30:41.020
I wanted to know if he was all
right. "Well, he's not all right."

30:41.060 --> 30:43.580
"He's dead. They shot him."

30:43.620 --> 30:47.340
And you just made
a whole fucking mess for me here.

30:47.380 --> 30:50.900
"I didn't do this, Lee. You did."

30:50.940 --> 30:53.420
"You know how the Party used
your photo?"

30:53.460 --> 30:56.020
As a portrait of their humanity.

30:56.060 --> 30:58.260
Look, we went around him.

30:58.300 --> 31:01.060
Did you know you make
Communist propaganda?

31:01.100 --> 31:03.900
"But it wasn't them."

31:03.940 --> 31:06.380
It was Wang Penfei.

31:07.380 --> 31:10.460
"We've known each other
for nearly 30 years."

31:11.860 --> 31:13.940
But we only ever speak
in your language.

31:15.380 --> 31:17.380
I'm sorry.

31:30.620 --> 31:32.860
Right here.

31:44.540 --> 31:47.980
"And I feel like my neck doesn't
HAVE those folds in real life."

31:49.060 --> 31:52.860
"Hello? Lee? Are you there?"
- Yeah, yeah. I'm here.

31:52.900 --> 31:55.580
No, that's just a shadow.
I can take care of that.

31:57.700 --> 32:01.020
Not our president!
Not our president!

32:01.060 --> 32:05.180
Tell me what democracy looks like!
This is what democracy looks like!

32:05.220 --> 32:09.980
Tell me what democracy looks like!
This is what democracy looks like!

32:18.260 --> 32:20.500
I know you're a vegan, Drishani.
It's, like, 90 percent

32:20.540 --> 32:22.620
of your conversation.
But my ex is arriving

32:22.660 --> 32:25.260
in, like, 15 minutes, and I feel
like I've still got pepper spray

32:25.300 --> 32:27.300
in my eyes. I'd like to wash it out,

32:27.340 --> 32:30.300
so can you just be a sister
and get me some fucking milk?!

32:30.340 --> 32:32.860
- "Please".
- Please! Yes. Please.

32:32.900 --> 32:34.940
Of course. Please.

32:34.980 --> 32:36.660
Hey.

32:40.060 --> 32:42.380
Bollocks!

32:44.500 --> 32:47.340
Well, thank you for coming!

32:47.380 --> 32:49.900
I thought you...
you went back to England.

32:49.940 --> 32:52.020
I landed this contract with Tesco.

32:52.060 --> 32:55.860
This is a... side project, pro bono.
I'm helping improve their outreach.

32:55.900 --> 32:58.740
So, you're working for
a multinational corporation

32:58.780 --> 33:03.060
and an anti-capitalist protest?
It's kind of schizophrenic, isn't it?

33:03.100 --> 33:06.020
Isn't it?! They can't work me out.
It's hilarious.

33:10.260 --> 33:12.060
So...

33:12.100 --> 33:13.900
congratulations.

33:13.940 --> 33:16.660
Who's the...

33:18.780 --> 33:21.820
Oh!
- You changed your number.

33:22.820 --> 33:26.020
It's took me ages.
- I-I would've let you know,

33:26.060 --> 33:29.740
but I just... I thought you didn't
wanna speak to me again, so...

33:29.780 --> 33:32.540
- You don't have to...
- Sorry. I just need to tell you...

33:32.580 --> 33:35.860
- You don't have to.
- I was not kind to you.

33:35.900 --> 33:37.380
But...

33:38.380 --> 33:40.700
...it's our lives, isn't it?

33:42.380 --> 33:45.260
It's our lives, so...
- Lee?

33:45.300 --> 33:47.380
I know, I know. - Because...
- I miss you.

33:54.100 --> 33:55.260
No.

33:59.300 --> 34:01.300
So, did you, um...

34:01.340 --> 34:03.660
Did you ever find him?

34:03.700 --> 34:07.020
Er, no.
He doesn't wanna be found, Tess.

34:09.300 --> 34:12.739
Ohhh! Thank you, Drishani!

34:12.780 --> 34:14.780
Hold that.

34:18.139 --> 34:20.380
OK!

34:28.100 --> 34:29.940
Oh!

34:30.940 --> 34:33.260
Did you just take a picture?!

35:01.500 --> 35:04.900
Hey, man! Long time, no see!

35:04.940 --> 35:07.140
Google tells me you moved into
wedding photography.

35:07.180 --> 35:09.620
Yeah, well.
You know, I'm just paying the bills.

35:09.660 --> 35:12.940
Er, do you accept
international commissions?

35:15.140 --> 35:18.340
Well, I'll have to ask my bail agent.

35:20.420 --> 35:22.580
Heyyyy!

35:43.420 --> 35:45.420
Ahhh!

35:48.980 --> 35:52.860
Ahhh!
Ohhh!

36:04.140 --> 36:08.060
Hey. Hey. She's so great. I'm so
happy this worked out for you two.

36:11.580 --> 36:13.580
The flower that blooms in adversity

36:13.620 --> 36:16.660
is the most rare and beautiful
of all.

36:16.700 --> 36:19.500
- Ah, that's wonderful.
- Yes.

36:20.500 --> 36:23.460
- It's from Mulan.
- Oh, come on!

36:23.500 --> 36:25.940
Hey, how's Tess?

36:26.940 --> 36:28.940
Yeah, she's...

36:29.940 --> 36:33.780
She's good, I think.
- And when's the trial?

36:33.820 --> 36:36.460
Um... three weeks.

36:37.660 --> 36:39.660
Look on the bright side.

36:39.700 --> 36:41.780
At least you GET a trial.

36:42.780 --> 36:45.140
God bless America.

36:47.380 --> 36:50.140
I'll show you how
this little thing works.

37:48.200 --> 37:50.040
Hey, Zhang Lin.

37:53.320 --> 37:56.840
You've been studying! Very good.

37:56.880 --> 38:00.360
What else did you hear?
- "My teeth are too white."

38:00.400 --> 38:05.720
Hey. I'm in Tiananmen, looking up at
the hotel where I was staying.

38:05.760 --> 38:08.520
I know you took that photo, Lee.

38:09.520 --> 38:12.160
But you never understood it.

38:44.880 --> 38:47.800
Hey...

39:04.320 --> 39:07.280
Let's go, Liuli! Go!

39:15.080 --> 39:17.440
Liuli! Liuli!

39:22.740 --> 39:25.500
Liuli! Liuli!

39:30.400 --> 39:31.640
Liuli!

39:31.680 --> 39:33.560
Liuli!

39:46.760 --> 39:48.360
Liuli! Liuli!

39:50.840 --> 39:52.760
Liuli!

39:52.800 --> 39:54.560
Liuli!

43:14.840 --> 43:17.880
'It wasn't a photograph
of protest, Lee.

43:17.920 --> 43:20.520
'It was a photograph of surrender.'

43:20.560 --> 43:23.240
That man wasn't important.
Liuli was important.

43:23.280 --> 43:25.640
The others were important.

43:25.680 --> 43:30.000
A million people speaking in
one voice!

43:30.040 --> 43:33.800
- There's so much that... that I want...
- "Some other time, maybe."

43:53.700 --> 43:55.700
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

44:06.680 --> 44:09.040
They've taken him!
They've taken him!
