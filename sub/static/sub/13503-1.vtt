You made a wrong turn, mister

03:16.655 --> 03:20.117
Honey, can you <i>pass</i> the scanner?

03:20.242 --> 03:21.327
Scanner?

03:27.208 --> 03:29.168
I crushed a spider

03:33.172 --> 03:34.965
Can you hurry UP?

03:45.142 --> 03:49.939
Maybe you should ask Mundo
to come tomorrow instead

03:50.272 --> 03:51.565
But why?

03:51.774 --> 03:57.071
They say killing a spider in the morning
brings bad luck to your guests

03:57.571 --> 04:02.743
He hasn't visited us in years
Besides, he's no guest to us

04:03.118 --> 04:05.788
He's right I'm no guest to you

04:06.038 --> 04:06.579
Mundo!

04:06.580 --> 04:07.748
Hola!

04:09.667 --> 04:11.167
How you have been, man?

04:11.168 --> 04:14.922
It's been so long Jeongyeon?

04:15.047 --> 04:16.423
Long time

04:20.052 --> 04:22.721
This is the real stuff

04:22.763 --> 04:25.974
So, Suriname's where you've been
for the last 3 years?

04:25.975 --> 04:29.435
That's right Did you
really find gold?

04:29.436 --> 04:31.020
It's nothing big yet

04:31.021 --> 04:33.106
A friggin' gold mine!
That's incredible

04:33.107 --> 04:34.691
Where exactly is Suriname?

04:34.692 --> 04:37.319
Between the US and South America

04:37.403 --> 04:42.156
Once I'm settled down,
I'll send you airline tickets

04:42.157 --> 04:43.616
Get outta here

04:43.617 --> 04:47.121
We finally get to travel abroad
thanks to Mundo?

04:48.831 --> 04:51.542
That's the least I can do
for you two

04:51.583 --> 04:55.461
You need to get away from work
from time to time

04:55.462 --> 04:58.882
And you will let me tag along
when you go, right?

05:00.676 --> 05:03.971
Hey, over here What
smells so good?

05:04.096 --> 05:06.140
Come and sit down, Sujae

05:06.390 --> 05:10.352
Man, I thought you were dead

05:10.477 --> 05:12.813
It's a long story

05:12.896 --> 05:15.107
What happened to you?
You look terrible

05:15.190 --> 05:20.988
It would have been a long story, too
if it wasn't for Jongbae

05:21.155 --> 05:23.906
I swear, until the day I die,
I'll never forget...

05:23.907 --> 05:27.118
Just pour me a drink What?

05:27.119 --> 05:28.454
Let's drink. Salud!

05:32.583 --> 05:35.502
Cheers Help yourselves

05:38.339 --> 05:40.674
<i>6 months later</i>

05:42.134 --> 05:43.844
Ow!

05:44.970 --> 05:47.222
Keep still
I'm trying to make you pretty

05:47.306 --> 05:50.559
But my skull hurts
if you pull too hard

05:51.060 --> 05:52.227
Skull?

05:53.354 --> 05:55.355
Where did you learn such a word?

05:55.356 --> 05:56.774
From daddy

06:00.069 --> 06:02.780
Did you say your skull hurts
in front of Hyerin?

06:02.863 --> 06:04.864
What are you talking about?

06:04.865 --> 06:07.242
You're acting funny

06:07.910 --> 06:10.704
Don't be silly

06:13.040 --> 06:14.374
Didn't Sujae call?

06:14.375 --> 06:16.043
No. Why?

06:16.877 --> 06:18.379
He's not returning my calls

06:19.963 --> 06:22.840
See you later, honey Bye bye.
Mommy

06:22.841 --> 06:25.886
I'll come in
right after I clean up

06:42.069 --> 06:43.611
ls everything alright?

06:43.612 --> 06:45.739
You look as if
you haven't eaten in days

06:45.906 --> 06:53.205
I was in the neighborhood and
had a sudden craving for your food

06:56.583 --> 07:00.629
Sorry...
I just stopped by for a bite

07:03.924 --> 07:06.802
<i>22:40, a male body found</i>

07:06.885 --> 07:11.140
<i>hanging from a tree
with a suicide note and a bag</i>

07:11.390 --> 07:12.933
<i>Request identification</i>

07:16.228 --> 07:21.274
The private loan that the deceased
owed amounted to $600,000

07:21.275 --> 07:26.905
$200,000 of which you
stood <i>as</i> a guarantor

07:27.114 --> 07:30.951
200 grand? That's bullshit

07:32.953 --> 07:36.331
I stood surety for just 50,000

07:37.166 --> 07:41.628
He said he needed it for 3 months
How was I supposed to say no?

07:41.795 --> 07:43.713
You stood surety for 200 grand?

07:43.714 --> 07:45.799
No, for 50,000

07:46.508 --> 07:51.013
How can interest pile up so quickly?

08:02.816 --> 08:04.651
I hate you, mommy

08:06.111 --> 08:08.030
Don't throw her stuff out

08:08.947 --> 08:10.407
Where are we gonna put them?

08:11.366 --> 08:14.495
It's no use crying over it
There's nothing you can do

08:32.261 --> 08:34.054
Hey What's up?

08:34.056 --> 08:35.014
Hey, Mundo

08:35.015 --> 08:38.351
- Did you have trouble finding your way here?
- No, the bus stopped right in front

08:38.352 --> 08:42.022
This is the man I look up to
like a big brother and his wife

08:43.148 --> 08:46.193
And this is mi amor, my girlfriend

08:46.568 --> 08:48.862
Hi, I'm Lee Suji

08:49.238 --> 08:50.364
4,000 bucks?

08:51.406 --> 08:56.035
So, all I gotta do is to bring in
the rough stones you excavate

08:56.036 --> 08:57.287
That's right

08:57.329 --> 09:00.790
4 grand for just 3 days
going back and forth to Paris?

09:00.791 --> 09:02.417
What do you say?

09:04.628 --> 09:08.340
I'm in. All you gotta do is
to bring back a bag

09:08.465 --> 09:11.802
Mundo has great connections
with the customs people

09:12.052 --> 09:14.720
Something doesn't smell right

09:14.721 --> 09:18.641
If you get caught,
you just pay customs

09:18.642 --> 09:21.061
If not, it's 'gracias'

09:21.853 --> 09:25.274
Why do customs a favor?

09:25.983 --> 09:27.858
You just have to pay customs
if you get caught?

09:27.859 --> 09:30.236
That's right Honey

09:30.237 --> 09:34.283
Can't you see that Mundo
is trying to help us out?

09:36.326 --> 09:37.911
Don't

09:38.662 --> 09:40.872
Don't you even think about it

09:41.957 --> 09:44.500
I said I'd give it a thought
not that I'd do it

09:44.501 --> 09:46.294
What's the difference?

09:46.295 --> 09:48.254
Listening to your friends
never did you any good

09:48.255 --> 09:51.300
Just drop it, will you?

10:02.227 --> 10:03.770
Perfect

10:04.021 --> 10:05.272
Are you home?

10:05.606 --> 10:06.773
Yes

10:11.069 --> 10:14.156
You're really trying my patience

10:14.281 --> 10:15.782
I'll pay you real soon

10:15.824 --> 10:19.995
When? You've been living off
your rent deposit for months

10:20.454 --> 10:24.958
Just a few days more, I'm so sorry
It won't happen again

10:25.500 --> 10:29.337
I've been sticking it out
because I felt sorry for you

10:29.338 --> 10:33.842
This house will find
a new tenant in no time

10:41.475 --> 10:44.144
Are you a little kid?
Did you commit a crime?

10:44.478 --> 10:46.313
'This'll never happen again?'

10:46.938 --> 10:50.984
It's not like we ran off with her money
We said we'd pay her

10:51.026 --> 10:52.653
With what money?

10:54.237 --> 10:55.739
What money?

11:03.955 --> 11:07.000
Hey, Mundo! It's me

11:07.334 --> 11:08.502
Honey

11:10.087 --> 11:13.215
Let's do this When do we start?

11:15.384 --> 11:21.223
What? You should've told me
that it was a job for a woman

11:21.473 --> 11:24.016
My wife? Forget it

11:24.017 --> 11:25.811
She doesn't even have a passport

11:26.728 --> 11:28.855
What's the matter with you?

11:28.939 --> 11:30.231
I said I'd take care of it, alright?

11:30.232 --> 11:33.109
If only you discussed
things with me...

11:33.110 --> 11:36.029
Would you have said yes?

11:39.449 --> 11:41.535
God damn it

11:43.370 --> 11:48.165
I'm such a fucking loser that
I dragged you into this shit hole

11:48.166 --> 11:52.002
I'm such a stupid fuck that
lost everything you saved up

11:52.003 --> 11:56.216
and got you humiliated
by the fucking landlady

12:02.514 --> 12:05.267
I can't believe you're still
trying to prove you're right

12:06.268 --> 12:11.565
Sujae's dead
You think he wanted to do this to me?

12:28.582 --> 12:30.292
Where are you going?

12:30.584 --> 12:37.716
It's okay, honey
Mommy and daddy aren't fighting

12:40.594 --> 12:41.636
Here

12:46.641 --> 12:49.936
Mommy, how come
daddy hasn't come home?

12:49.978 --> 12:54.733
He didn't come home
yesterday and yesterday

12:54.900 --> 12:57.986
I didn't get to see Seungah

13:01.531 --> 13:07.078
You miss your friend and
want to go back to kindergarten?

13:07.120 --> 13:08.413
Yeah

13:09.289 --> 13:11.958
Okay
But only if you eat your breakfast

13:59.840 --> 14:01.091
Mundo?

14:02.217 --> 14:04.135
It's me, Jongbae's wife

14:19.276 --> 14:22.320
Mommy This one's nice Come here

14:23.405 --> 14:26.032
It's a pink bunny, your favorite

14:27.284 --> 14:30.245
Hi. Here's 2 dollars

14:31.872 --> 14:32.998
Hyefin

14:37.168 --> 14:40.296
Mommy, when are
you coming home?

14:40.297 --> 14:43.048
Just three nights and mommy will
come home with a lot of money

14:43.049 --> 14:46.052
I'll buy you the doll
you wanted Really?

14:46.344 --> 14:50.891
Yes! So, be a good girl
and don't fight with Seungah

14:51.224 --> 14:52.434
Promise?

14:55.395 --> 14:57.521
Princess, your hands are
<i>as</i> cold as ice

14:57.522 --> 15:00.066
Mommy, I'm cold

15:03.904 --> 15:07.574
Why didn't you say so?
I'll give a piggy back ride

15:13.371 --> 15:15.457
Shall we sing the Tomato song?

15:15.999 --> 15:19.210
Wonderfully plump body

15:19.586 --> 15:22.964
Dressed in red

15:23.214 --> 15:26.384
Letting off a sweet and sour scent

15:26.593 --> 15:29.971
Here comes the
magnificent Mr. Tomato

15:30.221 --> 15:34.099
I will turn myself into juice!
Gulp!

15:34.100 --> 15:38.062
I will turn myself into ketchup!
Squirt!

15:38.063 --> 15:41.775
I will dance all day long! Hey!

15:42.150 --> 15:43.735
Hyerin, dad's home

15:58.291 --> 16:00.501
<i>Going away for a few days
Don't look for me</i>

16:00.502 --> 16:02.295
<i>I left Hyerin at Seungah's place</i>

16:07.884 --> 16:09.344
Going away?

16:12.305 --> 16:14.849
<i>30-Oct-04</i>

Ma'am

16:35.036 --> 16:37.163
Yes

16:38.331 --> 16:40.125
From Guyana?

16:40.834 --> 16:45.213
<i>We have a suspicious Asian female
traveling from Guyana</i>

17:15.285 --> 17:16.911
Wait here

17:31.468 --> 17:32.594

17:34.721 --> 17:36.056
Thank you

17:48.234 --> 17:50.904
Go ahead I'll meet you outside

18:04.751 --> 18:07.754
Excuse me, ma'am
May I see your passport?

18:09.672 --> 18:11.466
Your passport, please

18:13.218 --> 18:15.470
Your passport, ma'am

18:17.180 --> 18:19.974
Sangcheoﬂ

18:33.279 --> 18:35.615
Give me the keys I don't... know

18:35.698 --> 18:38.326
Give me the key to open the luggage

18:38.952 --> 18:40.537
It's not mine

18:41.663 --> 18:43.081
No... No!

18:53.133 --> 18:55.426
What's this? Cocaine?

18:57.262 --> 18:58.596
Cocaine?

18:59.139 --> 19:02.809
No... No cocaine

19:05.812 --> 19:09.440
You see? Cocaine No

19:13.153 --> 19:16.698
There are people waiting for me outside
Also in Guyana

19:16.990 --> 19:21.661
People... Guyana... No, please!

19:23.288 --> 19:24.455
People...

19:25.373 --> 19:27.083
Outside the airport...

19:44.184 --> 19:45.393
Suji!

19:48.021 --> 19:50.356
What happened to Mundo?

19:50.607 --> 19:52.358
He ran off on his own

19:54.527 --> 19:56.070
Did you give us up?

19:58.031 --> 20:02.410
I had no choice
They said it was all cocaine

20:02.535 --> 20:07.039
So, she was carrying 120 million dollar
worth of cocaine on your behalf?

20:07.040 --> 20:08.332
You've got it all wrong

20:08.333 --> 20:15.506
It was supposed to be rough stones
Seo Mundo said it was just stones

20:16.507 --> 20:19.886
So we just gotta catch
this Seo Mundo

20:20.178 --> 20:24.223
and he'll testify that your wife
was just an accessory

20:24.224 --> 20:29.854
But I can't get hold of him

20:31.481 --> 20:34.234
Where the hell is my wife now?

20:34.692 --> 20:37.320
You should inquire at
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

20:39.739 --> 20:41.449
We need a urine sample

20:41.783 --> 20:42.783
Sorry?

20:42.784 --> 20:48.331
A housewife from Korea
was caught trafficking drugs

20:48.623 --> 20:52.752
for the international
'Cali Cartel' drug ring

20:53.002 --> 20:55.255
And you're the husband

21:05.515 --> 21:07.725
Daddy's going to the toilet
real quick

21:08.351 --> 21:10.061
Hey!

21:11.354 --> 21:13.313
Do it here Excuse me?

21:13.314 --> 21:15.315
Do it here where we can see

21:15.316 --> 21:17.819
It's no use if you
put water in it

21:19.195 --> 21:21.614
But how can I...?

21:21.781 --> 21:25.535
Use that corner over there

21:25.618 --> 21:28.329
A sample of your hair, too

21:42.093 --> 21:44.595
Daddy, what are you doing?

21:45.930 --> 21:47.265
Get back to your seat

21:47.307 --> 21:51.435
- What are you doing?
- Go away But why?

21:51.436 --> 21:53.021
I said go away

21:54.981 --> 21:56.816
Mommy

21:57.984 --> 22:01.404
Mommy

22:10.913 --> 22:13.958
Ms. Lee must leave
France immediately

22:15.001 --> 22:16.544
What about me?

22:16.669 --> 22:20.465
As a suspect in flagrante delicto,
you'll face trial

22:21.924 --> 22:24.844
Sorry for leaving
without you Suji

22:24.927 --> 22:29.473
Please...
I had no idea it was drugs

22:29.474 --> 22:32.810
I'm just a housewife
and I have a little girl

22:32.977 --> 22:36.688
Can I make a call to Korea?
My husband doesn't know that I'm here

22:36.689 --> 22:38.690
Narcotics offenders are prohibited
from making calls

22:38.691 --> 22:43.446
Then, can you
call my husband for me?

22:43.529 --> 22:46.157
I gotta at least let him know
that I'm here

22:46.240 --> 22:49.535
As a fellow Korean,
I am begging you

22:49.619 --> 22:52.037
I work for the French
Public Prosecutors' Office

22:52.038 --> 22:54.624
Write a letter when you get to prison

22:54.707 --> 22:57.043
What a disgrace!

23:07.261 --> 23:09.847
Hyeﬂn". What's mommy gonna do?

23:12.392 --> 23:14.435
Honey, what am I gonna do?

23:16.854 --> 23:19.148

23:19.482 --> 23:22.568
How can she not have known?

23:27.490 --> 23:30.660
Alright... Ciao

23:34.163 --> 23:35.331
What do they say?

23:35.415 --> 23:39.210
The Embassy is looking into it
as we speak

23:41.879 --> 23:44.006
Give them a call after a few days

23:48.469 --> 23:52.180
These ignorant fools who
know nothing about diplomacy

23:52.181 --> 23:54.182

Absolutely right

24:01.441 --> 24:04.693
About the woman arrested
at Orly for smuggling drugs...

24:04.694 --> 24:08.448
Drugs? At Orly?
When did that happen?

24:09.115 --> 24:14.203
I thought you might like to
pay her a visit

24:14.287 --> 24:18.291
Can't you deal with that
sort of stuff?

24:18.374 --> 24:20.126
Yes, sir

How long will I be held here?

24:51.282 --> 24:53.409
You see,
I don't know any French...

24:56.787 --> 25:00.415
Shameful as I am to say this
but I am innocent

25:00.416 --> 25:03.543
If I knew it was drugs,
I never would've done it

25:03.544 --> 25:08.966
Yes, I'm sure
This is from the Embassy

25:13.971 --> 25:14.764
Alright then

25:14.847 --> 25:19.936

can you let me make a call?

25:20.061 --> 25:22.229
I've been here more than
twenty days now

26:33.259 --> 26:36.012
Is that... you?

26:36.971 --> 26:39.973
Where are you?
What the hell happened?

26:39.974 --> 26:41.517
<i>You're asking me?</i>

26:41.601 --> 26:44.395
How can you have gone there
without telling me?

26:44.437 --> 26:46.271
Where's Hyerin?
Ls she asking for me?

26:46.272 --> 26:47.647
<i>Is she with you?</i>

26:47.648 --> 26:50.108
Hold on She's in the car

26:50.109 --> 26:52.945
<i>How can you leave a 4-year-old
alone in the car?</i>

26:52.987 --> 26:55.406
What's wrong with you?

26:57.908 --> 27:02.913
Honey, please hurry
I'm almost there

27:03.456 --> 27:07.084
Suji is deported to Korea

27:07.168 --> 27:09.170
What? She's released?

27:09.253 --> 27:12.589
Yeah... and I have to wait
4 months to get trial

27:12.590 --> 27:15.258
Why the hell did you go there
without telling me?

27:15.259 --> 27:17.970
Why did you guarantee a loan
without telling me?

27:18.012 --> 27:19.597
<i>Honey?</i>

27:23.100 --> 27:24.977
Ma'am, your 3 minute's up

27:26.771 --> 27:28.356

27:28.481 --> 27:30.483
- <i>Please! Just 10 seconds more

27:30.524 --> 27:33.319
Hyerin! It's mommy

27:34.153 --> 27:36.988
- Hyerin? Please just a second

27:36.989 --> 27:40.284
It's mommy, baby Mommy?

27:41.535 --> 27:42.285
Honey?

27:42.286 --> 27:44.038
Wait! Honey?

27:46.457 --> 27:49.418
Please help me!

27:50.002 --> 27:53.506
Hello? Are you there?

27:54.340 --> 27:56.008
Song Jeongyeon!

28:06.352 --> 28:08.354
You have Lee Suji?

28:12.149 --> 28:15.695
Look at me
You know me, don't you?

28:15.903 --> 28:20.824
How come you're here when
my wife's still held in France?

28:20.825 --> 28:23.911
We're in the middle of interrogation
Please step outside

28:24.203 --> 28:27.664
Where is Mundo?
That fucking bastard

28:27.665 --> 28:30.917
Hey, I said we're in the middle
of interrogation

28:30.918 --> 28:32.335
Get out of here

28:32.336 --> 28:35.922
You gotta catch that bastard
to clear my wife of her charges

28:35.923 --> 28:40.010
He tricked her into committing a felony.
Can't you see that, damn it?

28:40.344 --> 28:41.971
Kim Jongbae!

28:42.638 --> 28:45.640
Who do you think you are
to run amok here?

28:45.641 --> 28:47.810
You're married to a felon

28:48.018 --> 28:51.396
Fly your ass over to Suriname
and nab the bastard yourself

28:51.397 --> 28:54.233
If you have a goddamn problem
with the judicial system

28:55.234 --> 28:59.196
I'm terribly sorry
I'm just so frustrated...

28:59.363 --> 29:05.411
I'll wait for you to finish
Then, have a chat with her

29:05.786 --> 29:10.374
Seo Mundo is wanted for
pulling a pyramid scam

29:10.458 --> 29:12.209
The detectives told me

29:12.460 --> 29:15.300
I thought you've been friends for years
Shouldn't you have known better?

29:16.756 --> 29:18.090
I know

29:19.091 --> 29:22.178
Do you know a guy called
Ha Taegwang?

29:22.428 --> 29:23.888
Ha Taegwang?

29:24.263 --> 29:28.642
They're like best buddies
Think they were in pyramid scam, too

29:29.351 --> 29:32.229
Yes, I met Ms Song in person
She seemed to be doing okay

29:32.271 --> 29:37.568
This is an advanced country
Prison facility is <i>as</i> good as hotel

29:37.610 --> 29:41.030
<i>But it takes 4 months
to be tried in court?</i>

29:41.113 --> 29:44.658
You know how slow the French are
Or don't you?

29:44.742 --> 29:47.620
What should I be doing here?

29:47.661 --> 29:50.955
Get a lawyer
That'll definitely speed things up

29:50.956 --> 29:52.792
and affect the decision positively

29:52.958 --> 29:57.838
<i>We'll continue our communication
with the prison</i>

30:00.716 --> 30:02.802
Focus on getting the money
for the lawyer

30:03.344 --> 30:05.679
How much should I be looking at?

30:05.763 --> 30:08.849
Perhaps around 10,000 ~ 20,000?

30:09.517 --> 30:11.726
<i>It could be more
if the trial drags on</i>

30:11.727 --> 30:15.814
if you can't afford one, France has
an excellent public defence system

30:15.815 --> 30:19.902
I'll call you back

30:24.532 --> 30:26.033
Was that her husband?

30:26.367 --> 30:30.162
He must be pretty agitated
with the wife locked up in prison

30:30.746 --> 30:35.960
Why did he make her do such a thing?
What a loser!

30:38.003 --> 30:44.801
If we present a petition and
the ambassador gets involved,

30:44.802 --> 30:47.220
we may be able to get her
indictment without detention

30:47.221 --> 30:51.350
Shouldn't we report this
to the ambassador?

30:51.642 --> 30:53.060
To the ambassador?

30:53.686 --> 30:57.648
If she gets indictment
without detention,

30:57.940 --> 31:01.569
she becomes our responsibility

31:02.236 --> 31:05.155
We mustn't waste
taxpayers' money like that

31:05.739 --> 31:11.036
She did carry drugs for a fact

31:11.370 --> 31:14.832
I guess she's in for a rough ride

31:26.886 --> 31:29.763
Hey! Excuse me

31:35.728 --> 31:36.896
Hey!

31:39.064 --> 31:42.192
Come out here for a second

31:42.902 --> 31:44.945
ls this a fucking joke?

31:49.116 --> 31:51.744
- <i>The number you have dialed...</i>
- <i>Damn you</i>

31:53.579 --> 31:54.914
Sweetie

32:07.217 --> 32:07.926
<i>3 months later</i>

32:07.927 --> 32:09.761
<i>3 months later Hi honey, hope
you're well I'm doing okay</i>

32:09.762 --> 32:12.681
<i>Hi honey, hope you're well
I'm doing okay</i>

32:13.015 --> 32:18.437
<i>It must be pretty cold in Seoul by now
Didn't Hyerin catch a cold?</i>

32:19.688 --> 32:23.359
<i>Please write me, honey
And don't worry about me</i>

32:34.036 --> 32:35.371
Get up

32:35.621 --> 32:37.122
You're being transferred

32:44.797 --> 32:50.636
I... go home? Korea?

32:50.719 --> 32:53.597
You're not going back to Korea

32:53.639 --> 32:55.808
You're going to another prison

33:11.323 --> 33:15.285
I... go home? Korea?
Korea... No?

33:15.452 --> 33:18.497
Where? Where?

33:18.747 --> 33:20.374
Stop asking

33:21.542 --> 33:23.961
You don't understand anything I say anyway

33:51.864 --> 33:55.492

What are you doing? I'm pregnant.

35:48.021 --> 35:48.896
You're pregnant?

35:48.897 --> 35:50.482
I'm telling you the truth

35:51.150 --> 35:52.651
Pregnant, eh?

36:04.788 --> 36:06.707
The cocaine must have burst inside

36:09.626 --> 36:11.003
Call an ambulance

36:39.323 --> 36:42.951
Don't you know how to say hello?

36:47.372 --> 36:48.999
Come here, Momo

37:03.013 --> 37:04.223
Swallow it

37:05.224 --> 37:06.183

Swallow it and go to sleep

Why are you doing this?

38:03.740 --> 38:07.786
Where is Seo Mundo? Answer me

38:09.037 --> 38:11.164
Should I believe you or not?

38:13.959 --> 38:17.128
Fucking morons!
Why go beat up a civilian

38:17.129 --> 38:19.298
instead of nabbing Mundo?

38:19.423 --> 38:20.716
Sorry

38:21.008 --> 38:26.346
I'm not the kind to bash
people up for no reason

38:26.763 --> 38:29.599
I hear your wife's in prison

38:59.838 --> 39:04.176
Yeah You're hilarious
Go wipe your own ass

I can't let them not smoke here

39:23.987 --> 39:27.741
I stopped by your house
and picked up your mail

39:27.824 --> 39:30.702
You must've written

39:31.495 --> 39:34.372
Just tell her the truth and
give her my address here

39:34.373 --> 39:36.040

43:57.469 --> 43:58.553
Yes

43:59.596 --> 44:01.181
You're a friend of Mundo's?

44:03.975 --> 44:05.477
Made in Suriname?

44:14.110 --> 44:16.571
5, 7, 9... Difference is
the weight in grams

44:16.988 --> 44:18.156
Pardon me?

44:20.659 --> 44:25.997
Lighter watches are more expensive
Which one do you want?

44:34.714 --> 44:39.260
Do you know a man
called Ha Taegwang?

44:40.595 --> 44:43.390
You're looking for Mr. Ha?

44:44.307 --> 44:48.353
He's out of office
Why don't you wait here?

44:51.356 --> 44:54.776
I'm telling you, he said
'Seo Mundo, made in Suriname'

44:55.068 --> 44:58.278
And I saw the same brand of cigars
that Mundo gave me

44:58.279 --> 45:01.991
Bring in Ha Taegwang
and you'll get a lead

45:02.158 --> 45:03.660
<i>Just hear me out</i>

45:08.123 --> 45:11.376
They watch too many movies

45:11.793 --> 45:13.670
What's the matter?

45:14.003 --> 45:16.715
He wants to tip me off about

45:16.756 --> 45:20.051
some Ha Taegwang character
playing detective

45:20.552 --> 45:24.347
Did you say Ha Taegwang?
He's on the wanted list

45:24.431 --> 45:25.515
What?

45:25.724 --> 45:28.476
That's right For fraud

46:55.939 --> 46:57.314
Get away from me, damn niggers!

46:57.315 --> 47:00.151
You called me a nigger, bitch?

47:00.360 --> 47:03.780
I said fuck you!

47:04.364 --> 47:07.200
You, Hellboy-cunt-licking whore

47:07.367 --> 47:10.078
What's going on? Move along

47:23.883 --> 47:25.760
Yalka...

47:28.179 --> 47:29.514
Thank you

47:34.477 --> 47:37.313
You out of your fucking mind, bitch?

47:45.029 --> 47:46.698
What have we got here?

47:46.906 --> 47:48.491
Give it back

47:54.539 --> 47:55.915
I'll kill you

48:01.337 --> 48:02.922
Help... Please...

48:32.660 --> 48:34.370
- Yalka
- Don't touch me

48:38.625 --> 48:40.877
Yalka... This

48:47.884 --> 48:49.385
Mama!

48:50.595 --> 48:52.263
It's my mom

48:52.764 --> 48:54.432
Sorry, mama

48:54.807 --> 48:59.062
I'm sorry...
The picture got wet

49:00.271 --> 49:05.777
I'm a mommy, too My baby...

49:08.696 --> 49:10.573
She's far away

49:14.035 --> 49:20.124
I miss my daughter, too
So, don't cry

49:22.251 --> 49:26.172
If you cry,
you mama will be sad

49:26.422 --> 49:29.050
Thank you, Song

49:34.806 --> 49:37.934
Something does smell
fishy It does, right?

49:37.976 --> 49:40.143
And the place was shut down?

49:40.144 --> 49:42.355
I checked it myself

49:42.438 --> 49:44.440
- Put out the word on him
- Yes, boss

49:44.524 --> 49:45.525
Let's go

49:46.484 --> 49:47.819
You're coming with us?

49:50.321 --> 49:51.489
Of course, I am

49:58.162 --> 49:59.372
Hello?

50:02.500 --> 50:07.296
I haven't heard from you in a while
You said these were important

50:15.722 --> 50:18.933
<i>Hi, darling How is everything?</i>

50:19.058 --> 50:21.019
<i>How is my little girl?</i>

50:21.769 --> 50:25.523
<i>I've been transferred to
an island called Martinique</i>

50:25.565 --> 50:29.192
<i>They said I would get
my trial in 4 months</i>

50:29.193 --> 50:31.820
<i>I don't understand
how I ended up here</i>

50:31.821 --> 50:35.867
<i>It was so cold in Paris
but this is a tropical island</i>

50:35.950 --> 50:39.537
<i>It's so hot and humid
that I can't sleep or eat</i>

50:39.871 --> 50:42.540
<i>All I can do is think about
you and Hyerin</i>

50:42.999 --> 50:44.360
Aren't you on night shift tonight?

50:47.462 --> 50:50.339
Hey, can you
find this Martin... place?

50:50.423 --> 50:52.884
Martinique... Ducos?
This is from your wife?

50:53.009 --> 50:54.761
So, find it

50:57.555 --> 51:02.643
<i>The Embassy people came once
and haven't replied to my letters</i>

51:03.603 --> 51:06.814
<i>In Paris,
they gave me work to do</i>

51:08.399 --> 51:11.277
<i>but there is nothing to do here</i>

51:13.571 --> 51:15.990
<i>And the days go terribly slowly</i>

51:22.121 --> 51:25.415
<i>You need money for everything here
even for some salt</i>

51:25.416 --> 51:30.713
<i>I have to buy stamps to send letters
I feel terrible asking you this</i>

51:31.422 --> 51:36.260
<i>but I really need some money
I know you're struggling as you are</i>

51:38.805 --> 51:44.644
<i>Can you send me a picture of Hyerin?
Some summer clothes and underwear, too?</i>

51:44.727 --> 51:47.271
<i>Don't forget the French dictionary</i>

51:47.772 --> 51:51.149
<i>And please show Hyerin
my pictures</i>

51:51.150 --> 51:53.694
<i>so she won't forget my face</i>

51:53.778 --> 51:57.740
<i>Show her the video from our wedding
Please do, honey</i>

52:07.166 --> 52:12.588
It's on the opposite side
of the planet from us

52:13.297 --> 52:16.425
It's an island in
the middle of the Caribbean

52:16.551 --> 52:17.760
It's far

52:24.600 --> 52:26.393
Super express, please

52:26.394 --> 52:30.148
Martinique... Ducos Prison?

52:31.107 --> 52:32.150
Yes

52:32.275 --> 52:36.820
International postal money order
take more than 20 days

52:36.821 --> 52:39.490
If you go through the Embassy,
they can process it directly

52:46.080 --> 52:53.504
<i>Thank you for calling the Korean Embassy
The office is now close</i>

52:53.796 --> 52:58.467
<i>Operating hours are from
9 am to 5 pm...</i>

53:05.266 --> 53:08.311
Who called in that joker?

53:10.855 --> 53:15.193
He was begging so badly
and I felt sorry

53:17.695 --> 53:20.698
I'm more sorry
for your sorry ass

53:25.536 --> 53:26.621
Chief?

53:28.873 --> 53:30.875
Is that... Kim Jongbae?

53:44.138 --> 53:45.765
Where is Mundo?

53:47.308 --> 53:49.435
Calm down, man

53:50.770 --> 53:52.688
Who the hell are you,
motherfuckers?

53:52.897 --> 53:55.733
Motherfuckers?
Did you call me a motherfucker?

53:55.858 --> 53:58.152
How dare you,
you fucking bastard!

53:59.070 --> 54:00.655
Don't move

54:01.822 --> 54:02.949
Get out of there

54:05.993 --> 54:08.246
Who the hell are you?

54:08.913 --> 54:10.289
Get him out of here

54:10.581 --> 54:12.792
Where is Mundo?

54:13.084 --> 54:17.880
How did you know this was
Seo Mundo's hideout?

54:17.964 --> 54:20.048
You told me to bring in Seo

54:20.049 --> 54:22.343
It was me that gave you information
about Ha Taegwang

54:23.302 --> 54:26.097
We've been keeping a tap
on it all along

54:29.308 --> 54:30.768
Who the hell are you?

54:34.063 --> 54:38.985
I'm a friend of
his from hometown

54:39.402 --> 54:41.237
I tagged along to
give him support

54:42.113 --> 54:48.119
Civilians shouldn't interfere with
police business like this

54:49.245 --> 54:54.792
Since this is classified information
Bear with us for a while longer

54:57.837 --> 55:00.965
Classified Information, my <i>ass</i>

55:01.424 --> 55:03.634
That's fucking classic

55:04.468 --> 55:05.761
Go fuck yourself

55:06.137 --> 55:08.222
I guess this is it for us

55:09.390 --> 55:11.475
I wish you wealth and happiness

55:13.644 --> 55:20.317
It always rains when the Indians
perform a rain dance.

55:20.318 --> 55:21.652
You know why?

55:23.654 --> 55:25.990
Because they don't fucking stop
until the rain falls

55:26.657 --> 55:29.660
like fucking bullheads

55:33.706 --> 55:35.124
<i>Martinique</i>

55:36.250 --> 55:38.294
How did she end up there?

55:38.669 --> 55:41.797
<i>I have no idea
She doesn't understand either</i>

55:41.881 --> 55:43.923
I'll look into it
and get back to you

55:43.924 --> 55:45.009
<i>Wait!</i>

55:45.426 --> 55:48.262
Shouldn't you know about it
before anyone?

55:48.387 --> 55:51.849
How are we supposed to
know details like that?

55:52.266 --> 55:57.438
Fine... Can I at least ask you to
process a money wire to the prison?

55:57.521 --> 55:59.522
They tell me it's faster
if I go through the Embassy

55:59.523 --> 56:03.026
You think our job is to provide
convenience for criminals?

56:03.027 --> 56:05.321
What would taxpayers say
if they found out?

56:05.363 --> 56:08.157
She can't do anything
without money

56:08.449 --> 56:09.783
<i>Please show leniency</i>

56:09.784 --> 56:13.788
You think a public servant is there
to run personal errands?

56:14.997 --> 56:18.709
Still on the phone?
Where's assemblymen's schedule?

56:21.295 --> 56:26.008
How many Michelin stars
is this place rated by?

56:26.300 --> 56:28.094
Oh, that one?

56:30.054 --> 56:32.098
It's a popular place

56:33.057 --> 56:35.726
What if they ask?

56:35.810 --> 56:39.062
They might think it's a restaurant
with no Michelin stars

56:39.063 --> 56:40.898
I'll check right away, sir

56:41.023 --> 56:45.111
This could be a big break
For you and I, you know?

56:46.987 --> 56:49.447
Given that the principal offender
Seo Mundo has yet to be arrested

56:49.448 --> 56:53.285
for this court to be able to proceed
with the trial of the defendant

56:53.661 --> 56:58.415
I hereby extend the provisional
detention of Song Jeongyeon

56:58.416 --> 57:00.709
by another 4 months

57:03.796 --> 57:06.799
Does the Korean Embassy have
any intention to provide an interpreter?

57:06.882 --> 57:10.386
Apologies, your honor. I placed
a request but they haven't responded

57:13.597 --> 57:14.765
Excuse me

57:15.766 --> 57:16.809
Hello?

57:18.978 --> 57:20.062
Yes?

57:26.944 --> 57:29.613
Why... I, here?

57:30.114 --> 57:35.786
I... Paris...
now, Martinique... Why?

57:36.454 --> 57:39.248
It's because the jurisdiction
is in Martinique

57:40.749 --> 57:43.751
Before we are able to
have a proper trial,

57:43.752 --> 57:46.504
we'll receive a review of legality
of confinement every 4 months

57:46.505 --> 57:49.383
Drug-related offenses can
get up to 24 months without trial

57:57.141 --> 57:59.477
<i>Kim, we got Sea Mundo</i>

58:08.486 --> 58:12.740
How can you do this to me
and call yourself a human being?

58:14.325 --> 58:16.327
Get off me for Christ's sake!

58:16.660 --> 58:18.829
What's your problem?

58:19.330 --> 58:23.125
She asked me to give
her the job What?

58:24.460 --> 58:28.964
She's in deep shit because of you
Do right by her

58:29.048 --> 58:34.136
Come here, you fucking bastard

58:34.261 --> 58:36.722
- Kim Jongbae!
- You, son of a bitch!

58:37.598 --> 58:39.725
Calm down
This is obstruction of justice

58:41.477 --> 58:44.355
Don't mess with
him until the trial ends

58:44.563 --> 58:47.608
You need a favorable testimony from him
to get your wife off the hook

58:56.242 --> 59:01.163
I'm so sorry, Mundo

59:01.789 --> 59:05.751
Please help me save Jeongyeon

59:06.085 --> 59:10.381
My daughter hasn't seen her mom
in 6 months

59:10.631 --> 59:17.346
Just tell them that she had
no knowledge of the drugs

59:17.429 --> 59:20.849
I beg you, please

59:21.559 --> 59:23.143
Please, Mundo

59:23.602 --> 59:25.396
Dear Mr. Consul

59:25.437 --> 59:29.691
I finally met the judge after
getting transferred to Martinique

59:29.692 --> 59:34.572
but I couldn't understand anything
because there was no interpreter

59:34.697 --> 59:37.240
I know this is a far
and remote place

59:37.241 --> 59:39.660
but is there any way
you can find an interpreter?

59:41.287 --> 59:42.580
Yellow face

59:50.796 --> 59:54.508
I thought your Embassy didn't have
anyone who spoke your language

59:54.592 --> 59:56.051
You wrote them again?

01:00:00.889 --> 01:00:05.519
This is against the rules
I'm confiscating them

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:10.399
I have no panties
Give me please

01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:12.067
Confiscated

01:00:12.092 --> 01:00:14.092
Subedit By: SharePirate.Com

01:00:30.294 --> 01:00:32.254
Hello, baby?

01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:48.187
<i>My darling, Jeongyeon</i>

01:00:48.729 --> 01:00:52.733
<i>Hyerin and I are doing great
She is well, too</i>

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:55.151
<i>Things are going well</i>

01:00:55.152 --> 01:00:58.113
<i>You have nothing to
worry about but yourself</i>

01:00:59.073 --> 01:01:04.286
<i>You go through so much for
meeting a foolish husband</i>

01:01:04.662 --> 01:01:08.666
<i>I blame myself for everything
that happened</i>

01:01:09.583 --> 01:01:11.502
<i>It's all my fault</i>

01:01:13.962 --> 01:01:18.676
<i>Let's not give up and believe
that it'll work out</i>

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:21.804
<i>You trust me, don't you?</i>

01:01:24.932 --> 01:01:28.435
<i>I couldn't find your underwear
so, I bought some new ones</i>

01:01:33.524 --> 01:01:36.026
<i>I suppose Hyerin has grown a lot</i>

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:41.573
<i>I can't ever pay her back
for what I've done to her and you</i>

01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:46.120
<i>Please send me some
recent pictures of Hyerin</i>

01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:49.707
Get moving, will ya?

01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:57.214
<i>If I... don't make it back
for her birthday</i>

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:00.551
<i>Please take care of it for me</i>

01:02:00.884 --> 01:02:04.137
<i>Take her to an amusement park
if you can afford it</i>

01:02:04.138 --> 01:02:05.305
Daddy

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:07.641
My baby

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:13.021
<i>Hyerin, it's me, mommy
Are you being a good girl?</i>

01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:18.569
Mommy is studying hard
so that she can come home sooner

01:02:19.319 --> 01:02:23.240
Can you promise
to be a good girl?

01:02:24.408 --> 01:02:27.745
Be happy and strong for me

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:31.915
I'm so sorry
I had to come so far

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.877
I'm really sorry

01:02:36.712 --> 01:02:38.422
One, two...

01:02:38.714 --> 01:02:42.050
Come on, give me a smile

01:02:44.386 --> 01:02:46.053
I'm the drug-trafficker's husband

01:02:46.054 --> 01:02:49.433
<i>Martinique! I looked into it</i>

01:02:50.476 --> 01:02:54.605
Your wife loaded
the drugs at Guyana

01:02:54.772 --> 01:02:57.440
That's why the jurisdiction
is in Martinique

01:02:57.441 --> 01:02:59.443
I already know that

01:02:59.485 --> 01:03:01.444
<i>Can you provide an interpreter?</i>

01:03:01.445 --> 01:03:02.905
An interpreter?

01:03:05.365 --> 01:03:08.786
There isn't a single Korean
living there

01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:11.955
<i>Should we send one from Paris?
It's 9 hours away</i>

01:03:12.039 --> 01:03:14.958
<i>And who's gonna
cover the expenses?</i>

01:03:15.751 --> 01:03:18.629
Ls there any way that
the Embassy can cover it?

01:03:18.712 --> 01:03:22.049
It's your responsibility
We don't have the budget for that

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:27.095
What is it that
the Embassy does, then?

01:03:27.429 --> 01:03:32.518
It's not my job
to explain that to you

01:03:32.893 --> 01:03:34.311
<i>I've really got to go</i>

01:03:43.487 --> 01:03:44.655
What did he say?

01:03:44.947 --> 01:03:47.741
He says there isn't a single Korean
living there

01:03:48.534 --> 01:03:51.161
How the hell did she end up
in a place like that?

01:03:51.203 --> 01:03:53.664
Shall I look up on the internet?

01:03:53.747 --> 01:03:57.584
The Embassy already said
there's no Korean living there

01:03:59.628 --> 01:04:04.090
<i>Do you know about a Korean housewife
looked away in prison</i>

01:04:04.091 --> 01:04:07.009
<i>in a remote island
in the middle of the Atlantic?</i>

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:10.806
<i>The lives of her family are ruined</i>

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:14.475
<I? July29, 2005 Seoul District Court
Park Sangcheol, Lee Suji and Song Jeongyeon

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:17.813
have all denied connection to the drugs
at the time of their arrest

01:04:17.896 --> 01:04:22.568
Were they aware of the drugs
when departing from Guyana?

01:04:22.943 --> 01:04:25.028
Sangcheol knew about it,
your honor

01:04:25.153 --> 01:04:27.364
What about Song Jeongyeon
and Lee Suji?

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.540
They had no idea

01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:49.803
Mr. Prosecutor

01:04:50.888 --> 01:04:52.890
I'm Song Jeongyeon's husband

01:04:53.932 --> 01:04:56.310
What is going to happen to
my wife now?

01:04:56.435 --> 01:04:58.312
Ask the Korean Embassy in France

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:04.151
But they don't make a habit of
explaining things

01:05:04.943 --> 01:05:07.321
Mr. Prosecutor

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:12.700
The trial records will be sent over
to the Korean Embassy in France

01:05:12.701 --> 01:05:16.246
Once they translate and notarize it
and submit it to the French court

01:05:16.371 --> 01:05:18.749
your wife will be able to get
an official trial

01:05:19.917 --> 01:05:21.793
I see... Thank you

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:25.338
Since Seo testified that
it was a simple participation

01:05:25.339 --> 01:05:27.341
her sentence won't be that long

01:05:27.799 --> 01:05:29.217
Thank you so much

01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:34.056

01:05:56.620 --> 01:06:00.456
Please have them well translated

and submit them safely
to the court

01:06:03.627 --> 01:06:05.963
I'll be calling you again

01:06:09.257 --> 01:06:14.554

Just sorting the outgoing mail, sir

01:06:35.283 --> 01:06:37.201
The assembly men will arrive

01:06:37.202 --> 01:06:40.497

01:06:40.706 --> 01:06:42.124
We'll clean it up right away

a three Michelin starred restaurant

01:07:02.602 --> 01:07:05.312
Only three?
It should be at least seven

01:07:05.313 --> 01:07:07.858
Three is the highest rating

01:07:08.692 --> 01:07:10.652
I was only joking

01:07:10.861 --> 01:07:14.531
You have such
a great sense of humor

01:07:24.624 --> 01:07:25.792
What's this?

01:07:26.084 --> 01:07:28.879
That's the pile from earlier

01:07:29.004 --> 01:07:32.758
These shouldn't be
lying around here

Documents to be shredded
from this quarter, please

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:22.515
Given that the principal offender
Seo Mundo has yet to be arrested

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:26.352
and neither the government of
Republic of Korea nor the Embassy

01:08:26.353 --> 01:08:29.647
submitted any relevant documents
for this court to be able to

01:08:29.648 --> 01:08:32.609
proceed with the trial
of the defendant,

01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:36.571
I hereby extend the provisional detention

My trial is possible

01:08:50.127 --> 01:08:51.627
Because

01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:55.881

01:08:56.133 --> 01:08:58.051

01:09:09.187 --> 01:09:12.482
Your Embassy is bad

01:09:12.774 --> 01:09:15.359
Your Embassy has no responsibility

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:21.158

<i>As ashamed I am, I, too, am

You talk as if I did a sloppy job
taking care of your daughter

01:10:33.104 --> 01:10:35.397

your trial under my supervision

01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:39.413
in a non-detainment capacity

01:22:39.497 --> 01:22:44.543
There are a few very important rules
to bear in mind

01:22:44.710 --> 01:22:47.253
You must be back at your apartment
by no later than 7 pm

01:22:47.254 --> 01:22:49.966
and may not stray away
from your living quarters

01:22:50.299 --> 01:22:52.634
You must always respond
to the convocations

01:22:52.635 --> 01:22:54.971
and come into this office
once a week to sign in

01:23:05.314 --> 01:23:08.985
Sorry. It's not great
This is for you

01:23:10.945 --> 01:23:13.155
See you next week. Okay?

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.862
<i>She's out on parole</i>

01:24:35.237 --> 01:24:37.573
Congratulations

01:24:37.615 --> 01:24:41.619
<i>It's worse than being in prison</i>

01:24:41.786 --> 01:24:43.579
<i>Now she has to pay the rent
and food?</i>

01:24:43.662 --> 01:24:45.831
You should ask the French court

01:24:45.915 --> 01:24:50.335
<i>How can I when
I don't speak French?</i>

01:24:50.336 --> 01:24:53.255
We advised you
to get an interpreter

01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:57.927
Complain to the French court directly
instead of bothering us

01:24:58.761 --> 01:25:01.514
<i>French Embassy in Korea</i>

01:25:02.598 --> 01:25:05.476
<i>My child's mother is being held
in French prison without trial</i>

01:25:05.559 --> 01:25:09.146
<i>Let my wife come home
from prison in Martinique</i>

01:25:19.573 --> 01:25:20.657
Who is that man?

01:25:20.658 --> 01:25:21.742
One moment

01:25:22.159 --> 01:25:24.954
Everyone is logged in on
'Supporters of Song Jeongyeon'?

01:25:25.246 --> 01:25:28.457
You may not understand
the significance of your work now

01:25:28.499 --> 01:25:32.294
Take pride in what you're doing
and keep posting comments

01:25:32.336 --> 01:25:35.630
By doing this, you're saving a family
and eventually the world

01:25:35.631 --> 01:25:38.134
Add more exclamation points
Use four!

01:25:39.969 --> 01:25:43.430
Where did you learn to do that?
Great job

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:47.143
Look at this, Mr. Ambassador

01:25:47.518 --> 01:25:49.645
It's on our website, too

01:25:51.939 --> 01:25:53.690
This is the public reaction?

01:25:53.691 --> 01:25:57.820
Yes, sir We're doing
the best we can

01:25:58.112 --> 01:26:01.031
but as you know, the French
are slow with everything

01:26:01.907 --> 01:26:07.413
Yes, it's our duty to protect the interests
of Korean citizens overseas

01:26:07.663 --> 01:26:09.748
Okay... Bye

01:26:11.333 --> 01:26:15.462
The problem is the French
who take forever to do anything

01:26:15.921 --> 01:26:17.755
When did we send off
those documents?

01:26:17.756 --> 01:26:20.551
Everything's a mess because
they didn't proceed with the trial

01:26:21.927 --> 01:26:24.346
What's with
all this fuss on the net?

01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:25.973
Mr. Consul

01:26:26.932 --> 01:26:31.187
How about taking a trip to Martinique?

01:26:31.770 --> 01:26:36.859
In case they hold you responsible
for not following the procedure

01:26:37.693 --> 01:26:39.695
Besides, it's the Caribbean

01:26:40.321 --> 01:26:42.198
People go there for vacation

01:26:44.867 --> 01:26:46.118
Vacation?

01:27:36.001 --> 01:27:38.045
I have nothing else to offer you

01:27:48.264 --> 01:27:51.725
Please contain yourself
in front of the Consul

01:27:51.976 --> 01:27:56.855
Everything else is fine but
because of the language problem

01:27:57.773 --> 01:28:00.901
it's hard to understand
what's going on

01:28:02.945 --> 01:28:05.948
and no one is
explaining things to me

01:28:06.156 --> 01:28:11.453
It must be hard being incarcerated
far from home

01:28:12.288 --> 01:28:16.125
But they say 'An evil may turn out
a blessing in disguise'

01:28:16.417 --> 01:28:20.295
People spend a lot of money
to come here for vacation

01:28:20.296 --> 01:28:23.799
Consider yourself lucky
Positive thinking, you know?

01:28:23.841 --> 01:28:26.385
When will I get my trial?

01:28:26.719 --> 01:28:29.888
It's no good feeling so anxious

01:28:30.806 --> 01:28:34.267
You won't be leaving
any time soon anyway

01:28:34.268 --> 01:28:35.102
Excuse me?

01:28:35.144 --> 01:28:37.146
Didn't you know?

01:28:37.730 --> 01:28:41.734
Drug offenses are
taken very seriously

01:28:41.817 --> 01:28:46.321
Simple carrying can get you
up to 1O years in prison

01:28:46.322 --> 01:28:48.324
And that's getting it easy

01:28:48.365 --> 01:28:55.205
1O years?
But I didn't know it was drugs

01:28:55.331 --> 01:29:00.209
That's the law here
Any way Ms. Song...

01:29:00.210 --> 01:29:01.419
It's Song Jeongyeon

01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:06.175
It's important to find
peace of mind, Ms. Song

01:29:08.969 --> 01:29:11.722
Have you ever tried meditation?

01:29:12.056 --> 01:29:14.350
These walls are perfect

01:29:14.475 --> 01:29:19.146
Sit facing the wall
with your legs crossed

01:29:19.188 --> 01:29:21.523
Try it It'll do wonders

01:29:22.024 --> 01:29:24.860
You can't just leave like this

01:29:28.572 --> 01:29:33.535
I am sorry
I committed a terrible crime

01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:37.872
I'll repent till the day I die
for bringing disgrace to my country

01:29:37.873 --> 01:29:39.541
So, please

01:29:41.710 --> 01:29:46.214
Mr. Consul, please send me
to a prison in Korea

01:29:46.215 --> 01:29:48.216
I'm not asking to be released

01:29:48.217 --> 01:29:50.969
You should try to find inner peace

01:29:51.053 --> 01:29:54.889
That way your husband can
focus on paying off his debt

01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:56.850
and getting a place to live

01:29:57.559 --> 01:29:59.728
What do you mean
'a place to live?'

01:29:59.812 --> 01:30:01.563
Your husband told me

01:30:01.605 --> 01:30:03.649
that he got kicked out
of the house

01:30:03.732 --> 01:30:07.319
Why don't you get yourself
something to drink?

01:30:21.333 --> 01:30:23.292
Please let me meet the judge

01:30:23.293 --> 01:30:25.129
Please one question!

01:30:25.254 --> 01:30:26.672
What does she want?

01:30:26.755 --> 01:30:28.674
Trial... Trial...

01:30:28.966 --> 01:30:32.052
Ten years? Really ten years?

01:30:32.302 --> 01:30:33.511
This is the court house

01:30:33.512 --> 01:30:36.264
You are only permitted to see me
in presence of a parole officer

01:30:36.265 --> 01:30:38.725
Am I really getting ten years?

01:30:39.059 --> 01:30:40.351
Is it true?

01:30:40.352 --> 01:30:44.356
Tell me, please

01:30:44.606 --> 01:30:46.150
Please!

01:30:55.576 --> 01:30:57.785
<i>Dear Mr. Consul, thank you for
coming all the way to meet me</i>

01:30:57.786 --> 01:30:59.872
<i>but I cannot accept the money
you gave me</i>

01:31:14.678 --> 01:31:18.348
<i>FA 0: Korean Embassy in France
FA 0: Mn Kim Jongbae</i>

01:31:24.021 --> 01:31:28.942
<i>My beloved Mr. Kim Jongbae,
It's your wife, Song Jeongyeon</i>

01:31:33.363 --> 01:31:36.158
<i>I remember the day we first met</i>

01:31:36.658 --> 01:31:38.577
<i>Our first night together</i>

01:31:38.827 --> 01:31:42.247
<i>and the moment we held Hyerin
in our arms for the first time</i>

01:31:44.166 --> 01:31:47.711
<i>These were the most brilliant
moments of my life</i>

01:31:48.545 --> 01:31:54.134
<i>I can clearly remember
the entire 8 years we spent together</i>

01:32:07.147 --> 01:32:08.524
Yalka

01:32:10.359 --> 01:32:11.693
Yalka

01:32:13.987 --> 01:32:15.155
Song?

01:32:15.614 --> 01:32:16.949
Song!

01:32:22.037 --> 01:32:23.789
Are you okay?

01:32:25.541 --> 01:32:27.042
Are you okay?

01:32:27.209 --> 01:32:32.089
Yes, I'm okay Are you?

01:32:34.299 --> 01:32:35.968
I'm okay

01:32:37.553 --> 01:32:39.388
I'm okay

01:32:39.805 --> 01:32:42.599
<i>I only realized after
I got released on parole</i>

01:32:42.724 --> 01:32:45.394
<i>that this was the Caribbean</i>

01:32:45.602 --> 01:32:49.064
<i>the place we promised to come
for our tenth wedding anniversary</i>

01:32:49.314 --> 01:32:50.983
<i>And I realized</i>

01:32:51.275 --> 01:32:53.902
<i>that I've been living in my nightmare</i>

01:32:54.945 --> 01:32:59.408
<i>I don't want you to struggle
in my nightmare any more</i>

01:32:59.616 --> 01:33:02.619
<i>You deserve to be happy</i>

01:33:02.911 --> 01:33:06.957
<i>As long as I endure this,
it'll only make you suffer more</i>

01:33:07.082 --> 01:33:12.420
<i>And that's the worst nightmare
I can imagine</i>

01:33:12.421 --> 01:33:15.215
Jeongyeon Open the
door, Jeongyeon

01:33:21.722 --> 01:33:23.598
<i>If it wasn't for you,</i>

01:33:23.599 --> 01:33:29.021
<i>I couldn't have survived the year
and a half in this deserted place</i>

01:33:29.688 --> 01:33:31.481
<i>So, I thank you</i>

01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:33.775
<i>and I regret</i>

01:33:35.277 --> 01:33:38.405
<i>I could have loved you more
I truly could have.</i>

01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:42.951
<i>Please tell Hyerin that I love her</i>

01:33:43.452 --> 01:33:44.870
<i>that I'm so sorry</i>

01:33:57.090 --> 01:33:58.383
It's my wife

01:33:58.550 --> 01:34:01.428
Something's not right
and I can't reach the Embassy

01:34:02.679 --> 01:34:04.138
Please look at this letter

01:34:04.139 --> 01:34:05.306
Can you come back later?

01:34:05.307 --> 01:34:10.437
Please check if she's
alive Come back later

01:34:16.485 --> 01:34:17.819
Later?

01:34:19.738 --> 01:34:21.490
When?

01:34:28.121 --> 01:34:31.333
A woman who carried drugs
deserves to die?

01:34:33.001 --> 01:34:35.003
She's not a Korean citizen?

01:34:37.506 --> 01:34:42.260
Is it so damn hard to check
if she's alive or dead?

01:34:51.019 --> 01:34:53.230
What are you doing?
Put that down

01:34:57.192 --> 01:34:59.695
Get off of me

01:35:01.321 --> 01:35:05.867
ls it so hard to find out
if she's alive or dead?

01:35:13.667 --> 01:35:17.337
Hang in there,
Jeongyeon Jeongyeon

01:35:26.430 --> 01:35:29.141
Wait for me, Jeongyeon

01:35:33.478 --> 01:35:34.896
Kim Jongbae

01:35:38.859 --> 01:35:39.943
Come out!

01:35:43.113 --> 01:35:46.032
Jeez, look at you
Not now, let's go

01:35:46.116 --> 01:35:50.203
This is a producer from KBC
He wants to do a story on Jeongyeon

01:35:50.412 --> 01:35:54.541
My name is Shin Cheolho
You must've been through a lot

01:35:55.584 --> 01:35:57.544
I have good news for you

01:35:57.836 --> 01:36:01.798
Netizens have found a Korean
living in Martinique

01:36:01.965 --> 01:36:07.512
But the Embassy told me
there were no Koreans living there

01:36:08.889 --> 01:36:13.769
Did this person meet Jeongyeon?

01:36:13.852 --> 01:36:16.020
Is she okay?

01:36:16.021 --> 01:36:20.984
She's stable now but she's suffering
from a severe malnutrition

01:36:22.944 --> 01:36:26.364
We are planning to fly over to Martinique
Are you coming with us?

01:36:27.574 --> 01:36:28.658
Pardon?

01:36:43.632 --> 01:36:44.758
Pardon?

01:36:47.135 --> 01:36:48.720
I see... Okay

01:36:48.970 --> 01:36:52.265
We'll go straight to her parole house

01:36:52.641 --> 01:36:53.975
What do they say?

01:36:54.476 --> 01:36:56.394
She was discharged this morning

01:36:59.064 --> 01:37:03.985
She is really fragile
I don't know how she managed until now

01:37:06.446 --> 01:37:07.739
This is it

01:37:17.332 --> 01:37:18.667
Honey

01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:24.339
Jeongyeon, are you there?

01:37:25.507 --> 01:37:27.050
Jeongyeon

01:37:33.265 --> 01:37:34.516
Honey

01:37:35.475 --> 01:37:39.020
It's me Open the door

01:37:42.148 --> 01:37:43.525
Jeongyeon

01:37:54.619 --> 01:38:00.542
Why are you crying? Don't cry

01:38:06.548 --> 01:38:09.009
Open this door

01:38:10.385 --> 01:38:11.636
Open the door

01:38:28.862 --> 01:38:31.489
Look at you
What happened to you?

01:38:33.909 --> 01:38:36.244
Is that really you?

01:38:36.578 --> 01:38:39.956
You came all this way here?

01:39:01.645 --> 01:39:03.313
Look at you

01:39:05.815 --> 01:39:10.111
Let me show you Hyerin

01:39:17.452 --> 01:39:20.121
<i>Hyerin, do you have something
you want to tell mommy?</i>

01:39:20.163 --> 01:39:21.414
<i>I do</i>

01:39:24.292 --> 01:39:25.919
<i>What is it?</i>

01:39:27.796 --> 01:39:35.637
<i>Mommy, I can't remember your face</i>

01:39:36.137 --> 01:39:42.477
<i>My skull hurts because of that
Hurry back home, mommy</i>

01:39:43.103 --> 01:39:45.981
<i>I love you</i>

01:39:47.983 --> 01:39:49.484
<i>Anything else?</i>

01:39:49.818 --> 01:39:55.657
I will... Mommy is coming home soon
I love you and miss you, too

01:40:18.430 --> 01:40:20.431
Are you sure you never received
the documents?

01:40:20.432 --> 01:40:24.019
Tell them to send the documents right away
if they have them

01:40:24.269 --> 01:40:26.103
Ms Song's case is
pretty straightforward

01:40:26.104 --> 01:40:27.688
Was she deceived or not?

01:40:27.689 --> 01:40:32.109
Without evidence to contrary, we have
no choice but to assume criminal intent

01:40:32.110 --> 01:40:36.531
If such documents exist,
that assumption can be changed

01:40:36.573 --> 01:40:38.283
But where are the documents?

01:40:40.035 --> 01:40:42.787
What challenges did you encounter
while defending Ms Song?

01:40:43.872 --> 01:40:50.754
Listen! What can I do when I can't
even communicate with my client?

01:40:50.962 --> 01:40:54.132
There was nothing I
could do Stop filming

01:40:54.591 --> 01:40:58.052
How come the Embassy didn't know
that you were here?

01:40:58.053 --> 01:40:59.679
I'm puzzled myself

01:40:59.846 --> 01:41:03.725
I sent my documents to Paris last year
to have my passport renewed

01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:35.006
Here we are in the Carribean
after all

01:41:44.891 --> 01:41:47.102
How come they're still up?

01:41:49.354 --> 01:41:52.440
I guess they can't sleep either

01:41:56.986 --> 01:41:58.321
Honey

01:42:03.535 --> 01:42:06.913
can I go home instead of you?

01:42:09.958 --> 01:42:11.793
I want to go

01:42:24.722 --> 01:42:28.184
Okay, let's do that

01:42:30.395 --> 01:42:32.230
Let's do that, Jeongyeon

01:42:47.829 --> 01:42:49.372
Your wife isn't coming?

01:42:49.497 --> 01:42:51.457
She can't come to the airport

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.962
She's afraid she couldn't bear
to come back here

01:42:56.504 --> 01:42:58.089
I understand Let's go

01:43:16.274 --> 01:43:18.985
Our hearts go out to her
regarding the situation

01:43:19.027 --> 01:43:22.070
It must be so hard
being away from her child

01:43:22.071 --> 01:43:24.991
and face loneliness and hardship

01:43:25.033 --> 01:43:27.660
It seemed that your hearts
didn't go out that far

01:43:28.286 --> 01:43:30.955
You told her there were
no Koreans living there

01:43:31.539 --> 01:43:34.250
but there was a Korean woman
who's been studying there for 3 years

01:43:34.375 --> 01:43:40.506
We did the best we could with
the given manpower and budget

01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:42.299
We absolutely regret the situation

01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:45.886
What about the trial records?
According to the judge and prosecutor...

01:43:45.887 --> 01:43:47.888
That's what I wanted to talk about

01:43:47.889 --> 01:43:52.267
We put a lot of time and effort
into translating and notarizing it

01:43:52.268 --> 01:43:54.604
and sent it out by registered mail

01:43:54.729 --> 01:43:58.233
This is the outgoing mail book

01:43:58.566 --> 01:44:02.069
As you can see, the documents
were posted on November 24

01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:04.155
We also have a copy

01:44:04.239 --> 01:44:07.532
France may seem like an advanced country
but there's always strikes

01:44:07.533 --> 01:44:10.453
and they're not
as precise as we are

01:44:11.246 --> 01:44:13.248
You said you sent them out
by registered mail?

01:44:13.581 --> 01:44:15.750
It's mandatory for official documents

01:44:15.875 --> 01:44:17.919
Then, you must have the receipt

01:44:19.420 --> 01:44:21.589
Are you being serious?

01:44:21.839 --> 01:44:27.345
We're civil servants hired by
the Korean government

01:44:27.595 --> 01:44:30.848
Are you accusing us of lying?

01:44:31.391 --> 01:44:33.643
Mr. Chu, bring them the receipt

01:44:34.978 --> 01:44:36.688
Excuse me for a moment

01:44:42.777 --> 01:44:43.444
ls this all?

01:44:43.611 --> 01:44:44.821
Wait

01:44:46.614 --> 01:44:48.116
This is from last year, too?

01:44:50.618 --> 01:44:55.123
Just a minute How
well did you hide it?

01:44:55.707 --> 01:44:58.042
- Move over
- I'm still looking, sir

01:45:00.712 --> 01:45:02.088
Here it is

01:45:05.174 --> 01:45:06.759
No, this isn't it

01:45:07.135 --> 01:45:10.513
It's not some old receipt
that's important

01:45:11.139 --> 01:45:15.643
We have sent the documents
That's what matters, right?

01:45:18.855 --> 01:45:22.525
How many times
did I ask you to check it?

01:45:22.817 --> 01:45:24.985
Do you know who
you're talking to?

01:45:24.986 --> 01:45:27.697
Get that camera off my face

01:45:27.947 --> 01:45:29.365
Stop filming

01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:40.667
What's the matter with him?

01:45:40.668 --> 01:45:42.170
Somebody stop him

01:45:42.337 --> 01:45:43.795
You talked to me on the phone

01:45:43.796 --> 01:45:45.339
Why get all violent?

01:45:45.340 --> 01:45:47.717
- Calm down
- Stop him

01:45:48.384 --> 01:45:52.764
You got my calls, didn't you?
Didn't you?

01:45:53.389 --> 01:45:56.017
Do you have any idea what
an awkward situation you put us in?

01:45:56.100 --> 01:46:00.229
Your husband barged in
with a TV camera

01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:03.733
We're not criminals

01:46:04.484 --> 01:46:06.902
What ungrateful people you are!

01:46:06.903 --> 01:46:10.530
Calm down. You're acting as if
we did something wrong

01:46:10.531 --> 01:46:12.658
Explain it kindly

01:46:13.743 --> 01:46:15.870
I don't understand

01:46:16.162 --> 01:46:23.002
I'll be honest with you
You are making a huge mistake

01:46:23.294 --> 01:46:28.508
You think these television people
can help solve your problem?

01:46:28.966 --> 01:46:31.677
You are currently on parole

01:46:31.761 --> 01:46:35.890
Pulling something like this
is breaking French law

01:46:35.973 --> 01:46:37.850
What are you telling me?

01:46:37.892 --> 01:46:39.977
You could be going to back to jail

01:46:40.103 --> 01:46:43.898
You keep poking around at
the French judicial system

01:46:44.023 --> 01:46:46.567
How would that make them feel?

01:46:47.235 --> 01:46:53.074
And the trial records...
they're not <i>as</i> important as you think

01:46:53.366 --> 01:46:55.701
They can't expedite
the process either

01:46:55.785 --> 01:47:00.706
Stop being so stubborn about
something that's of little importance

01:47:01.416 --> 01:47:06.129
We're acting stubborn?

01:47:06.546 --> 01:47:09.799
Take what I just said to heart
and tell your husband

01:47:09.882 --> 01:47:12.927
that he'll ruin everything
if he continues like that

01:47:13.928 --> 01:47:15.179
Wait

01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:19.350
Let's go Wait! Please

01:47:21.519 --> 01:47:22.603
What now?

01:47:22.687 --> 01:47:23.938
Let's go

01:47:28.234 --> 01:47:29.610
This is from France

01:47:30.445 --> 01:47:31.696
Here

01:47:42.290 --> 01:47:44.959
recommend that
you hold off the broadcast?

01:47:45.793 --> 01:47:48.296
What the fuck is wrong
with these people?

01:47:49.046 --> 01:47:51.548
This won't affect us
broadcasting the program

01:47:51.549 --> 01:47:54.009
but since this concerns you also,
I thought I should let you know

01:47:54.010 --> 01:47:57.221
It's just blackmail
There is nothing they can do

01:47:57.972 --> 01:47:59.307
Excuse me

01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:01.017
Hello, Jihye

01:48:03.144 --> 01:48:04.729
What?

01:48:06.314 --> 01:48:11.611
How can it not be important?

01:48:13.112 --> 01:48:17.116
How can they say
we're being stubborn?

01:48:17.158 --> 01:48:20.828
Don't believe a word they say
It's just blackmail

01:48:21.078 --> 01:48:24.790
I never said I wouldn't pay
for what I've done

01:48:24.999 --> 01:48:29.504
All I wanted was a little attention

01:48:29.587 --> 01:48:32.173
<i>I know... Stop crying
It'll make you weaker</i>

01:48:32.381 --> 01:48:34.217
<i>This isn't over yet</i>

01:48:35.551 --> 01:48:37.011
Jongbae, it's on

01:48:37.094 --> 01:48:42.225
<i>Martinique, a remote Caribbean island
22 hours away by plane</i>

01:48:42.266 --> 01:48:45.560
<i>There is a Korean woman locked away
in prison here for over a year</i>

01:48:45.561 --> 01:48:50.107
<i>I never imagined it could be drugs
I thought it was rough gemstones</i>

01:48:50.233 --> 01:48:52.108
<i>Ms Song's case is
pretty straightforward</i>

01:48:52.109 --> 01:48:53.861
<i>Was she deceived or not</i>

01:48:57.365 --> 01:48:58.616
Jeongyeon

01:48:59.659 --> 01:49:01.035
Take a look at this

01:49:05.873 --> 01:49:07.707
<i>"How much she
must miss her daughter?"</i>

01:49:07.708 --> 01:49:10.126
<i>"It's not just the Embassy but a problem
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs"</i>

01:49:10.127 --> 01:49:11.504
<i>"Be strong, Jeongyeon"</i>

01:49:11.546 --> 01:49:15.967
This is creating a huge stir
on the net

01:49:16.634 --> 01:49:19.553
If America has nuclear bombs
we have netizens

01:49:19.554 --> 01:49:21.681
We're an Internet nation

01:49:27.228 --> 01:49:30.188
<i>"Scandalous!
Waste of taxpayer money"</i>

01:49:30.189 --> 01:49:32.692
<i>"I'm sending you support as a mother
Never give up hope "</i>

01:49:35.861 --> 01:49:38.781
<i>"Hang in there, Song's family
We have your backs!"</i>

01:49:43.995 --> 01:49:47.456
<i>"How can the lost time
be compensated?"</i>

01:50:03.931 --> 01:50:08.644
<i>I'm Song Jeongyeon's husband</i>

01:50:10.021 --> 01:50:16.402
<i>My wife has been held in prison
in Martinique without trial</i>

01:50:17.612 --> 01:50:23.075
<i>but, no one cared
to listen to my story</i>

01:50:25.244 --> 01:50:29.081
<i>I blamed the man who
put my wife in this situation</i>

01:50:29.415 --> 01:50:32.376
<i>I blamed my country
that did nothing for her</i>

01:50:33.252 --> 01:50:36.756
<i>and I blamed my wife for
getting herself in this mess</i>

01:50:39.175 --> 01:50:43.512
<i>But, I'm the one that drove her
to go so far away</i>

01:50:45.473 --> 01:50:47.016
<i>It was me</i>

01:50:55.608 --> 01:51:00.863
<i>I failed to keep my promise
to always keep her happy</i>

01:51:01.447 --> 01:51:04.158
<i>and keep the smile
on my daughter's face</i>

01:51:04.950 --> 01:51:09.538
<i>But' this new hope
you have given me</i>

01:51:11.832 --> 01:51:13.668
<i>I will never let it go</i>

01:51:19.173 --> 01:51:21.973
<i>"Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
we'll be watching how you deal with this"</i>

01:51:22.426 --> 01:51:24.512
<i>What if Song was from
a powerful family?</i>

01:51:26.180 --> 01:51:29.392
<i>"Citizens are watching you"
"Do not delete this post again!"</i>

01:51:31.727 --> 01:51:33.979
<i>"Please share this post
so that more people can see"</i>

01:51:41.862 --> 01:51:45.616
<i>"We're sending Song a parcel"
"Raising funds to help Song's family"</i>

01:51:48.285 --> 01:51:50.496
<i>Give Song your hope</i>

01:51:56.001 --> 01:51:57.712
I knew it would lead to this

01:51:57.962 --> 01:52:00.923
<i>"Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
do you really work for this country?"</i>

01:52:07.722 --> 01:52:10.516
It's all over the TV and the Internet

01:52:10.558 --> 01:52:13.769
I heard they've been reassigned
somewhere in Central Asia

01:52:13.853 --> 01:52:15.229
Uzebekistan?

01:52:15.479 --> 01:52:16.939
Kazakhstan?

01:52:24.739 --> 01:52:28.367
<i>08-Nov-06</i>

01:52:30.244 --> 01:52:31.411
<i>24 months in detention</i>

01:52:31.412 --> 01:52:33.747
<i>24</i> ' <i>months in detention
This</i> is <i>Bekhor. Your new</i> lawyer

01:52:33.748 --> 01:52:35.541
Bonjour, Olivier Bekhor

01:52:36.500 --> 01:52:37.835
Bonjour, nice to meet you

01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:43.840
He says not to worry
Everything will be fine

01:52:43.841 --> 01:52:48.304
Feel free to doze off
it usually gets boring in the court

01:52:49.305 --> 01:52:51.307
And someone's come
from the Embassy

01:52:55.561 --> 01:52:56.771
Shall we?

01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:27.885
Please sit here

01:53:38.729 --> 01:53:46.487
The 37 kilos of cocaine, the defendant
tried to smuggle into the country

01:53:46.987 --> 01:53:51.742
is an enormous quantity
worth over 85 million Euro

01:53:52.159 --> 01:53:56.497
This fact alone makes it impossible
to avoid severe punishment

01:53:57.206 --> 01:53:58.707
Your Honor,

01:53:59.333 --> 01:54:04.088
I believe you have examined
Seo Mundo's trial records

01:54:04.296 --> 01:54:07.507
He testified in court that in order to
to get the defendant involved

01:54:07.508 --> 01:54:09.676
in his cocaine smuggling scheme

01:54:09.677 --> 01:54:14.849
he tricked her into believing
that she was carrying gemstones

01:54:15.641 --> 01:54:18.435
Until now, the defendant,
Song Jeongyeon,

01:54:18.561 --> 01:54:21.063
has never been
involved in any crime

01:54:21.397 --> 01:54:26.902
including drug-related offenses
or faced criminal indictment

01:54:27.778 --> 01:54:33.784
Despite this, she was forced
to spend 2 years in prison

01:54:34.577 --> 01:54:40.124
in a country she is completely
unfamiliar with

01:54:44.295 --> 01:54:46.005
Does the defendant

01:54:46.463 --> 01:54:48.257
have any last words to say?

01:54:54.847 --> 01:55:00.769
In that case, sentencing will be
delivered after 10 minutes...

01:55:04.565 --> 01:55:05.900
I...

01:55:09.653 --> 01:55:13.824
I committed a crime

01:55:20.831 --> 01:55:28.831
I committed a crime because of
my foolish desire to earn money

01:55:36.513 --> 01:55:38.599
I'm a criminal

01:55:40.517 --> 01:55:42.853
And for the past 2 years

01:55:45.856 --> 01:55:51.362
I've been repenting for my sin

01:55:55.157 --> 01:56:02.665
But there are others
I must beg for forgiveness

01:56:07.753 --> 01:56:09.463
My family

01:56:12.091 --> 01:56:14.259
My husband who lost his wife

01:56:16.887 --> 01:56:20.224
My daughter who grew up
without her mother

01:56:22.643 --> 01:56:30.067
She's six years old now

01:56:32.069 --> 01:56:36.907
She was barely four when I left

01:56:38.492 --> 01:56:43.872
She has turned five
and then six

01:56:49.086 --> 01:56:57.086
I have caused her so much pain
that cannot be undone

01:57:02.433 --> 01:57:05.477
I want to go back home
pay for the wrong I've done

01:57:10.858 --> 01:57:14.361
Please let my family have

01:57:16.613 --> 01:57:20.075
the wife and mother back

01:57:27.291 --> 01:57:29.877
I want to go back home

01:57:39.428 --> 01:57:40.888
I...

01:57:43.599 --> 01:57:45.726
want to go back home

01:57:49.438 --> 01:57:52.149
I want to go back home

01:58:24.473 --> 01:58:28.101
The court sentences the defendant,
Song Jeongyeon

01:58:28.102 --> 01:58:32.439
for the charges of violation
of Drug Control Law,

01:58:32.773 --> 01:58:37.027
the Customs Act and the Aviation Act

01:58:39.613 --> 01:58:41.615
one year of imprisonment

01:58:42.491 --> 01:58:46.452
He said one year
You've already served two years in prison

01:58:46.453 --> 01:58:48.705
That means you can go home now

01:58:51.667 --> 01:58:55.295
Wait, you have
already served 2 years

01:58:56.839 --> 01:58:58.632
What about the year already spent?

01:58:58.674 --> 01:59:02.678
If you file a lawsuit, you'll be able
to claim compensation

01:59:02.886 --> 01:59:07.349
You can claim compensation
for the extra year you served

01:59:09.143 --> 01:59:11.937
No... I just want to go home

01:59:30.330 --> 01:59:33.834
<i>Welcome home
Song Jeongyeon supporters</i>

01:59:45.929 --> 01:59:49.390
