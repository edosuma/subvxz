WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.671
Previously on The Originals...
A thousand years ago,

00:03.713 --> 00:06.549
we three made an eternal vow,
always and forever.

00:06.590 --> 00:07.800
Well, that vow
now includes my daughter.

00:07.842 --> 00:09.760
VINCENT: Hope’s gone.
You said there was
a way to save her.

00:09.802 --> 00:11.721
If we pull the Hollow
out of Hope, then I need a place

00:11.762 --> 00:13.764
that’s connected to Hope
to put it.

00:13.806 --> 00:15.433
When this spell is over, you’ve
got to get away from each other

00:15.474 --> 00:16.976
and you have
to stay away from Hope.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.644
Nik, you have pushed it
too far this time.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.354
VINCENT: If the Mikaelsons
come together,

00:20.396 --> 00:23.190
it will signal darkness
like we’ve never known.

00:23.232 --> 00:24.900
Yes, it does appear
to be escalating.

00:24.942 --> 00:26.360
REBEKAH: It is bloody biblical
is what it is.

00:26.402 --> 00:28.696
Declan sent these
to tide you over

00:28.738 --> 00:29.989
until your date tomorrow.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.907
If you don’t marry
that guy, I will.

00:31.949 --> 00:32.992
Rebekah Mikaelson,

00:33.033 --> 00:34.493
the love of all my lives,

00:34.535 --> 00:35.911
will you marry me?

00:38.372 --> 00:40.040
You going somewhere?
I got suspended.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.751
Hope Marshall got suspended?

00:41.792 --> 00:43.669
FREYA: Hope gave a Crescent pack
boy at her school

00:43.711 --> 00:44.879
some of her blood

00:44.920 --> 00:46.547
so he could...
Become a hybrid?

00:46.589 --> 00:48.382
:
I made a mistake.

00:48.424 --> 00:49.675
GRETA: No one wants
any trouble, Hayley.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.177
We just want the hybrid.

00:51.218 --> 00:53.137
They want to kill me now...
Henry, feel better.

00:53.179 --> 00:54.346
That’s weird.
I actually feel better.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.681
Because you’re sired to me.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.308
Where’s your mom?
I don’t know.

00:57.349 --> 00:58.893
She said she’d only be gone
a few minutes,

00:58.934 --> 01:00.394
but then she never came back.

01:00.436 --> 01:01.896
Dad?
I was looking for your mother.

01:01.937 --> 01:05.858
She’s missing.

than it is coffee.

07:09.012 --> 07:10.347

07:54.600 --> 07:56.643
after she reads your palm,

09:35.284 --> 09:39.705

09:39.746 --> 09:41.581

I know. Okay?

09:43.875 --> 09:46.503

Henry jump from the turret.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.675
A werewolf wouldn’t
survive that kind of fall.

10:33.717 --> 10:36.345
Yeah. Well, Lizzie also said

10:36.386 --> 10:40.474
that I exploded an orphanage
with my brain when I was eight.

10:41.892 --> 10:44.853
You can,
uh, look now.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.815
Yeah, I-I heard that one.

10:48.857 --> 10:52.861
I also heard you’re
a long-lost Romanian princess.

10:57.532 --> 10:59.993
So...

11:00.035 --> 11:02.579
what is your secret, Marshall?

11:04.039 --> 11:06.416

could you maybe wait here?

11:08.627 --> 11:10.420
Yeah.

11:10.462 --> 11:13.215
They’ve got me all wrong,
you know.

11:13.256 --> 11:14.758
Truth is,

11:14.800 --> 11:17.803
I exploded an orphaned
Romanian princess with my brain.

11:19.971 --> 11:22.516

11:38.365 --> 11:40.158
you’re awfully chipper.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.161
You might avoid sneaking up on a

11:43.203 --> 11:45.247
Where’s Hayley Marshall?

11:45.288 --> 11:47.999
Best guess: roaming
about her giant house

11:48.041 --> 11:50.836
sorting out inspired new ways
to be emotionally unavailable.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.838
Who the hell’s asking?

11:52.879 --> 11:54.714
My name

11:54.756 --> 11:56.216
is Klaus Mikaelson.

11:56.258 --> 11:58.718
Doesn’t ring a bell.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.637
Does Hayley have any enemies?

12:00.679 --> 12:01.721
Enemies?

12:01.763 --> 12:03.348
Nah.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.350
She’s a single mother,
not a supervillain.

12:07.018 --> 12:08.687
You’re Hope’s father,
aren’t you?

12:08.728 --> 12:10.856
You look like her,
round the eyes.

12:10.897 --> 12:13.859
If you don’t
cooperate, Declan,

12:13.900 --> 12:16.069
"round the eyes" is
where I’m gonna start

12:16.111 --> 12:18.447
carving off pieces of you.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.991
Hayley stood me up, okay?

12:21.032 --> 12:22.826
It’s not exactly rare.

12:22.868 --> 12:26.037
I figured, hell, Hope’s dad
must have done a number on her.

12:26.079 --> 12:29.040
Well,
since you’re obviously
a right ray of sunshine,

12:29.082 --> 12:32.335
it must have been someone else
broke her heart-- and Hope’s.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.921
Don’t say my
daughter’s name.
Really?

12:34.963 --> 12:36.047
Look around.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.635
I’m here...

12:40.677 --> 12:42.012
birthdays, holidays.

12:42.053 --> 12:44.598
We’ve been teaching
her to drive.

12:44.639 --> 12:46.016
Where the hell were you?

12:47.309 --> 12:50.145
You are utterly
disposable.

12:54.608 --> 12:55.650
Seriously, Dad?

13:11.708 --> 13:13.376
Looks like you need

13:13.418 --> 13:15.003
to go back to the butcher’s
immediately.

13:15.045 --> 13:16.922
You won’t remember

13:16.963 --> 13:18.715
meeting me today.

13:20.091 --> 13:21.551
Ah.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.637
Mornin’, kid.
Um...

13:23.678 --> 13:24.846
I’ll be back.

13:24.888 --> 13:26.890
I forgot to stop
by the Shank.

13:26.932 --> 13:29.851
But saved you a bread
pudding in the fridge.

13:29.893 --> 13:31.478
Your favorite.

13:37.776 --> 13:39.569
Go home, Hope.

13:39.611 --> 13:42.405
: You’re
not even gonna look at me?

13:44.783 --> 13:46.660
Mom’s missing, Dad.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.121
I’m scared.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.964
We’re too close.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.341
I can hear the whispers:
you must, too.

14:01.383 --> 14:04.010
Let me help you find her.
If you don’t do as I say,

14:04.052 --> 14:06.263
I’ll have Freya bind you
to the compound with a spell.

14:07.639 --> 14:10.559
I don’t want it to come to that.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.561
Go home.

14:31.955 --> 14:33.748
Oh, guys, behave.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.584
We’re not looking for trouble.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.377
We’re here for answers.

14:37.419 --> 14:40.755
Yeah, sorry about the,
uh, beeramid, though.

14:40.797 --> 14:41.923
Where’s your alpha?

14:43.925 --> 14:45.719
We were wondering
the same thing.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.554
Hayley made a whole bunch
of promises

14:47.596 --> 14:50.473
before she locked herself up
in her castle with her daughter.

14:50.515 --> 14:52.642
Now, I hear she was planning
on giving that hybrid

14:52.684 --> 14:54.102
some lessons in
self-control.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.520
Is there any chance that he, uh,

14:55.562 --> 14:56.646
didn’t like the sound of that?

15:00.817 --> 15:05.238
I’m guessing that racing
heartbeat in the cabin is his.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.448
Doesn’t matter.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.199
You’re not invited in.

15:09.534 --> 15:11.661
Yeah?

15:11.703 --> 15:13.413
Well...

15:13.455 --> 15:15.999
I will happily smoke him out.

15:16.041 --> 15:19.836
The king of the city
doesn’t require an invitation.

15:19.878 --> 15:21.504
The king?

15:21.546 --> 15:24.841
Well, feel free
to put a tariff on my tea.

15:24.883 --> 15:28.637
You’re not getting your hands
on that boy.

15:40.815 --> 15:43.026
Vincent, what
can I do for you?

15:43.068 --> 15:46.655
Well... you can do for me
the exact same thing

15:46.696 --> 15:48.406
you do for
everybody else--

15:48.448 --> 15:50.075
look into the future
and reassure me

15:50.116 --> 15:52.494
that the sky ain’t gonna fall
on top of my head.

15:52.535 --> 15:54.079
I’m sorry, I can’t.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.163
I mean, I got money.

15:55.205 --> 15:56.456
It’s not that.

15:56.498 --> 15:58.375
You’re not asking
about a new job

15:58.416 --> 16:00.210
or whether you dump
a girlfriend.

16:00.251 --> 16:01.961
You have greater questions.

16:02.003 --> 16:04.089
I don’t believe in that.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.383
Now, you are known
to be the greatest seer

16:06.424 --> 16:08.635
in New Orleans,
and you mean to tell me

16:08.677 --> 16:10.804
that you don’t believe
in the future?

16:10.845 --> 16:14.683
I don’t believe in looking
further than one ought to.

16:14.724 --> 16:17.310
I don’t believe that endings
are written in advance.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.604
That’s what you’re
here for, isn’t it?

16:19.646 --> 16:21.856
You want to know
about the end.

16:21.898 --> 16:24.442
I cannot get through my day

16:24.484 --> 16:26.444
without having the feeling
that the world

16:26.486 --> 16:28.113
might crack open at any moment.

16:28.154 --> 16:31.366
Now, if I’m the only person
who is feeling that way,

16:31.408 --> 16:34.160
then maybe I’m the only person
who can do something about it.

16:34.202 --> 16:35.704
So what I’m looking for

16:35.745 --> 16:37.497
is some kind
of guidance.

16:38.623 --> 16:40.291
Please.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.679
Come on, Klaus.

16:52.721 --> 16:55.890
A little good news
would go a long way.

16:55.932 --> 16:59.561
Maybe I can help with that.

16:59.602 --> 17:02.063
You’re early.
I’m early.

17:02.105 --> 17:03.440
You’re here.
I’m here.

17:03.481 --> 17:05.233
You’re here. Oh...
Yes, baby.

17:06.735 --> 17:08.153
Hi.
Hi.

17:11.239 --> 17:13.783
:
I don’t feel well.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.827
I’m so hungry.

17:15.869 --> 17:19.289
You should stay away from me.
No.

17:19.330 --> 17:20.832
The Crescents
won’t protect me now that...

17:20.874 --> 17:23.251
Now that you’re a hybrid?

17:23.293 --> 17:24.586
They will, Henry.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.546
Hayley’s like you.
She’s been busy

17:26.588 --> 17:27.797
with Hope, but
she stood up

17:27.839 --> 17:28.965
for you.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.675
She won’t do
that again.

17:33.011 --> 17:34.053
What do you mean?

17:34.095 --> 17:35.472
Henry...

17:35.513 --> 17:36.639
what did you do?

17:36.681 --> 17:38.016
Just trust me.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.934
I have to run.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.895
JOSH:
That wouldn’t
end well.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.530
You invited me in
last summer.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.282
Aiden’s brother’s birthday,
remember?

17:55.658 --> 17:57.577
We were friends once, Lisina.

17:59.162 --> 18:00.663
Don’t let him take me.

18:02.624 --> 18:05.376
Look, Henry killed a cool person
who didn’t deserve to die.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.378
He can’t just go back
to geometry class,

18:07.420 --> 18:09.005
and I think you know that.

18:10.632 --> 18:13.343
Marcel has two rules.

18:13.384 --> 18:16.262
First, he doesn’t
kill vampires.

18:16.304 --> 18:18.473
Henry will be punished,
but he’ll survive.

18:18.515 --> 18:19.933
What’s the sentence?

18:19.974 --> 18:22.769
200 years in the
head garden? No.

18:22.811 --> 18:25.104
Look, my second rule is:
nobody hurts kids.

18:25.146 --> 18:27.649
I won’t ruin his life;
he’ll just do a few years.

18:27.690 --> 18:28.942
Look at him.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.319
He’s a nice kid.

18:31.361 --> 18:32.821
Not when he’s wracked
by bloodlust.

18:32.862 --> 18:35.031
He needs to dry out,
take his punishment.

18:35.073 --> 18:37.200
When he gets out,
he’ll be one of my guys, okay?

18:37.242 --> 18:39.786
I don’t care if he’s
half werewolf or half mermaid--

18:39.828 --> 18:41.371
I protect my guys.

18:48.294 --> 18:49.796
Henry,

18:49.838 --> 18:52.298
this is the only way
I know how to protect you.

18:52.340 --> 18:53.591
I’ll be right here

18:53.633 --> 18:55.218
waiting for you after.

18:55.260 --> 18:56.886
No. Please.

18:56.928 --> 18:58.555
Marcel.

18:58.596 --> 18:59.681
No.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.769
You can come in.

19:18.700 --> 19:19.742
Oh.

19:19.784 --> 19:20.910
Uh...

19:20.952 --> 19:22.370
you weren’t in my room--

19:22.412 --> 19:23.913
I thought you left.

19:23.955 --> 19:25.707
Still here.

19:28.960 --> 19:32.046
You weren’t scared someone
would catch you sniffing around?

19:33.339 --> 19:35.300
Well, according
to my school files,

19:35.341 --> 19:37.010
I have a rebellious nature

19:37.051 --> 19:38.803
and a callous disregard
for authority.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.097
So... no.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.604
Just ask.

19:47.645 --> 19:50.440
Okay? I-I know
you want to.

19:52.066 --> 19:54.027
This is like
a house of horrors.

19:54.068 --> 19:55.403
Viking grimoires.

19:55.445 --> 19:57.614
A million
weird knives.

19:57.655 --> 20:00.366
And did you know you have a dead
redhead wrapped in a sheet

20:00.408 --> 20:01.993
in your parlor?

20:02.035 --> 20:03.912
Yeah. That’s my dad’s crazy ex.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.663
It’s a sleeping spell.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.082
Just no one really knows
what to do with her.

20:08.124 --> 20:09.459
Normal.

20:11.169 --> 20:12.420
Hey.

20:13.504 --> 20:15.131
Look, I can keep a secret.

20:15.173 --> 20:16.841
I got plenty of my own.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.718
So, what are you?

20:21.471 --> 20:23.640
My name is...

20:23.681 --> 20:25.642
Hope Mikaelson.

20:28.144 --> 20:32.023
My grandmother practically
invented dark magic.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.776
My mom is the Crescent alpha.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.235
And...

20:36.277 --> 20:38.529
my dad is...

20:38.571 --> 20:40.823
Niklaus Mikaelson.

20:43.701 --> 20:46.120
So that makes you...

20:46.162 --> 20:48.998
The mythical tribrid freak show.

20:54.462 --> 20:57.006
Okay, uh, underage
hybrid chained up

20:57.048 --> 21:00.093
in my house-- to be clear, the
optics on this are not awesome.

21:00.134 --> 21:02.136
I thought you
were gonna bury me alive.

21:02.178 --> 21:03.429
Well, first we got
a few questions.

21:03.471 --> 21:04.847
Let’s call it
a fair trial.

21:04.889 --> 21:06.891
All right, we heard
what you said to Lisina.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.434
Why don’t you think
Hayley Marshall’s

21:08.476 --> 21:09.644
gonna keep protecting you?

21:12.730 --> 21:13.690
Where is she?

21:13.731 --> 21:14.774
I don’t know.

21:14.816 --> 21:16.693
What did you do to her?
Nothing.

21:16.734 --> 21:19.195
I don’t...
I don’t know where she is.

21:19.237 --> 21:21.823
Just please don’t ask me
any more questions.

21:24.617 --> 21:27.662
I mean, look at him.
He’s a gnat.

21:27.704 --> 21:30.623
I mean, there’s no way you took
on Hayley Marshall by yourself.

21:30.665 --> 21:32.291
Henry.

21:34.127 --> 21:36.004
Who are you protecting?

21:45.430 --> 21:47.765
His sire.

21:53.187 --> 21:55.565
So...

21:55.606 --> 21:58.234
your blood turns
werewolves into...

21:58.276 --> 21:59.861
vampire hybrids.

22:01.404 --> 22:05.491
And my kiss turns princes
into frogs.

22:05.533 --> 22:08.327
Maybe. The theory
remains untested.

22:16.502 --> 22:19.130
♪ ♪

22:20.798 --> 22:22.800
It must have
been so lonely,

22:22.842 --> 22:24.761
keeping your life a
secret all this time.

22:25.887 --> 22:27.138
KLAUS :
Hope!

22:27.180 --> 22:29.891
You have to go.

22:29.932 --> 22:32.852
He will literally wear
your spine as a necklace. Leave.

22:37.648 --> 22:39.442
Please tell me it isn’t true.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.864
What have you done
with your mother?

22:54.999 --> 22:57.960
Well, it’s not the
botanical gardens,

22:58.002 --> 23:01.130
but I guess it’ll do
for a reading.

23:01.172 --> 23:02.757
This is where
you were gonna take me

23:02.799 --> 23:04.217
on a first date, isn’t it?

23:04.258 --> 23:05.676
I suppose it’s kind of pointless

23:05.718 --> 23:08.054
to try to hide anything
from a mind reader, huh?

23:08.096 --> 23:09.347
I don’t read minds.

23:17.146 --> 23:18.940
When I ask the earth a question,

23:18.981 --> 23:21.609
I can taste its truth
on my tongue.

23:24.987 --> 23:27.073
So...

23:29.784 --> 23:32.495
Ask your question.

23:32.537 --> 23:34.330
Now, if there’s anybody
who can cause the collapse

23:34.372 --> 23:36.332
of New Orleans
the way we know it,

23:36.374 --> 23:38.334
it’s Klaus Mikaelson, so...

23:38.376 --> 23:41.254
go ahead and ask about him.

24:01.399 --> 24:04.735
It’s the empress.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.946
Oh, Vincent.

24:06.988 --> 24:08.948
This isn’t about Klaus at all.

24:08.990 --> 24:10.533
It’s about his daughter.

24:15.204 --> 24:16.873
KLAUS:
Do you have any idea
what you’ve done?

24:16.914 --> 24:19.167
I knew it would take
something big to bring you home.

24:19.208 --> 24:21.377
So you had your
little hybrid friend
attack your mother?

24:21.419 --> 24:22.920
Henry just did
the heavy lifting.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.964
And "attack" is a
really strong word.

24:25.006 --> 24:26.299
Mom’s fine.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.136
In a really nice coffin,
sleeping.

24:30.178 --> 24:33.514
I cloaked her in a sleeping
spell that I wrote myself.

24:33.556 --> 24:35.224
Oh, well, in that case,
I’ve never been prouder.

24:35.266 --> 24:36.642
Where is she?

You’re just gonna
go disappear again

Hope, you are in danger
when we’re in proximity.

24:41.856 --> 24:43.441
I know you feel that.

24:50.907 --> 24:53.409
The dark magic
inside us

24:53.451 --> 24:55.453
manifests itself in ugly ways.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.496
We could be putting others
in danger, too.

I can’t believe Hope did this.

25:11.302 --> 25:15.640
Oh, no, she’s, uh,
right on schedule.

25:15.681 --> 25:17.642
My teenage temper tantrums

25:17.683 --> 25:19.644

Mm-hmm.
It’s all really
mushy and gross.

25:36.285 --> 25:37.870
Yeah?

25:37.912 --> 25:40.414
I just didn’t realize
how much this city suffocated me

25:40.456 --> 25:41.791

25:44.919 --> 25:46.420
Keelin?
Mm

25:46.462 --> 25:48.714

Okay?

Good-bye, Hope.

Uh...

the symptom, not the disease.

27:40.868 --> 27:42.370
It’s not my business.

But New Orleans is.

27:44.872 --> 27:47.083
You were gone;

all of this is just

to be that spark

I mean, she’s just got
to change her course.

34:34.865 --> 34:38.660
That was really nice,

34:38.702 --> 34:41.288
Great. I’ll give myself a point.

34:41.330 --> 34:43.373
What?

something nice, follow rules.

If I, uh,
have a bad thought, or...

34:55.052 --> 34:58.013
lose my temper,
then I lose a point.

34:58.055 --> 35:01.517
Oh, honey, you can’t put that
kind of pressure on yourself.

everything to save me.

Um...

35:26.375 --> 35:29.378
I don’t think that, um...

And... you are good.

35:49.523 --> 35:51.608
Period.

Show me anybody
who says otherwise,

38:36.815 --> 38:39.526
I’ll get the werewolves.

No, Keelin.
I need you to leave New Orleans.

38:44.865 --> 38:47.075
I need you to go on your trip.

38:47.117 --> 38:49.453
See the world.

38:49.494 --> 38:51.872
Save people.

38:51.913 --> 38:53.331
Breathe.

38:53.373 --> 38:56.460
Stop.

38:56.501 --> 38:57.836
Okay, we’re not doing this
again.

38:57.878 --> 39:00.756
Okay? I can’t let you
stay here, Freya.

39:00.797 --> 39:02.466
It is not an option.

39:02.507 --> 39:06.303
I can’t be the reason
your whole life is on hold.

39:06.344 --> 39:10.390
And I can’t be of any
use to my family--

39:10.432 --> 39:14.144
to Hope-- with that burden.

39:14.186 --> 39:17.189
Look, I love you, Freya.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.400
I have loved you
through everything.

39:20.442 --> 39:22.652
Let me be here for you.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.991
I can’t, Keelin. I can’t.

39:32.037 --> 39:36.416
I can’t love you and my
family at the same time.

39:38.585 --> 39:41.004
I don’t want you to stay.

39:48.220 --> 39:50.555
♪ Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh ♪

39:50.597 --> 39:52.724
You did the right thing.

39:52.766 --> 39:54.101
♪ Come on, come on,
let’s go... ♪

39:54.142 --> 39:56.728
Henry’ll be okay, I promise.

40:00.482 --> 40:02.609
Daywalkers,

40:02.651 --> 40:04.444
nightwalkers,

40:04.486 --> 40:07.405
witches and wolves.

40:07.447 --> 40:09.366
I invited you here tonight

40:09.407 --> 40:12.035
from all the corners
of this city to celebrate.

40:12.077 --> 40:16.248
Tonight, justice was served.

40:16.289 --> 40:18.834
HENRY:
♪ Do you know what it means ♪

40:18.875 --> 40:21.294
♪ To miss New Orleans ♪

40:21.336 --> 40:25.382
♪ And miss it
each night and day? ♪

40:25.423 --> 40:28.260
The hybrid Henry will suffer his
punishment, and when he emerges,

40:28.301 --> 40:31.221
New Orleans will open her arms
to him again.

40:31.263 --> 40:34.683
Henry is a symbol
of the peace that we enjoy

40:34.724 --> 40:39.020
when we serve New Orleans
first, and ourselves second.

40:39.062 --> 40:41.189
♪ Do you know what it means... ♪
So dance,

40:41.231 --> 40:44.985
drink, romance this city
as she deserves.

40:45.026 --> 40:47.571
Tomorrow...

40:47.612 --> 40:50.532
we do it again.

40:55.787 --> 40:58.582
Hey, thanks for the ride
back to school.

40:58.623 --> 41:00.208
Oh. Sure.

41:03.587 --> 41:06.423
Hey...

41:06.464 --> 41:08.633
is everything okay, Marshall?

41:08.675 --> 41:10.385
My name’s not Marshall.

41:10.427 --> 41:12.762
Right.

41:15.682 --> 41:19.019
Hope.

41:19.060 --> 41:21.938
(footsteps running,
people screaming)

41:21.980 --> 41:26.610
MAN:
Somebody help him!

41:26.651 --> 41:29.404
(indistinct,
overlapping shouting)

41:34.868 --> 41:37.412
Oh, my God.

41:37.454 --> 41:40.832
HOPE:
Henry.

41:50.759 --> 41:53.428
:
No. No.
