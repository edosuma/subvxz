00:13.380 --> 00:15.280
I like what I'm seeing here!

00:15.348 --> 00:17.782
- I like what you're doing right now!
- I like what you're doing!

00:17.851 --> 00:19.944
- I like what you're doing!
- I like what we're all doing!

00:20.020 --> 00:22.648
- I like this guy!
- This is insane!

00:22.722 --> 00:25.350
- I know!
- This is good! This is a good scene!

00:25.425 --> 00:28.326
- I've never seen so many beautiful people in my life!
- Hey, check it out!

00:28.395 --> 00:30.920
Even Sweet Dee's getting lucky!

00:30.997 --> 00:34.194
That dude's gonna bang your sister, bro.

00:34.267 --> 00:37.100
- This is good, man. I feel good.
- You look good, brother.

00:37.170 --> 00:39.502
No, no, no, no.
I feel better than good.

00:39.572 --> 00:43.770
- You know, I feel like, um... I feel like dancing.
- Whoa, it feels good, man!

00:43.843 --> 00:45.834
- You should.
- I feel like dancing!

00:45.912 --> 00:48.710
- Get out there, buddy. Make it happen. Nice.
- I feel like dancing!

00:51.451 --> 00:53.385
<i>I love that little man.</i>

00:53.453 --> 00:55.444
This is great.
I mean, what's going on?

00:55.522 --> 00:58.286
- This is, like, the greatest night Paddy's has ever seen.
- I know!

01:00.026 --> 01:03.018
<i>- Kind of a young crowd, right?
- Yeah!</i>

01:03.096 --> 01:05.223
- Really, really young.
- Mm-hmm.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.460
<i>What, do you think these kids
are in college or what?</i>

01:09.536 --> 01:13.563
I don't know.
Hey. You. How old are you?

01:13.640 --> 01:15.699
Twenty-one?

01:18.945 --> 01:21.379
Everybody, out!

01:48.441 --> 01:50.602
But I don't understand
how you guys could let this happen.

01:50.677 --> 01:52.702
It was not my fault.
I was working behind the bar.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.270
Come on, Dennis. You remember
what it was like in high school.

01:55.348 --> 01:57.441
The minute we caught word
that a bar wasn't carding...

01:57.517 --> 01:59.815
we would just pack the place
the following weekend.

01:59.886 --> 02:02.377
They probably had a recon crew
come in last week.

02:02.455 --> 02:05.015
- They definitely had...
- Why, you guys? Why were we not carding?

02:05.091 --> 02:06.820
- Not my job.
- Not my job either.

02:06.893 --> 02:10.090
It's all of our jobs. We could get
into a lot of trouble for this.

02:10.163 --> 02:14.327
And we also have a social responsibility
to keep teenagers from drinking.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.391
I guess.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.830
- I don't know about that though.
- Oh, Mac!

02:20.907 --> 02:23.740
- Mac, don't.
- Hold on a second. Hear me out.

02:23.810 --> 02:28.372
It wasn't that long ago that we were in
the same position as these youngsters, right?

02:28.448 --> 02:31.611
<i>I mean, we'd get kicked out of some bar,
and what did we do, Den?</i>

02:31.684 --> 02:34.209
We would get a bunch of 40s
from a homeless guy...

02:34.287 --> 02:36.221
and we'd go sit in some park, right?

02:36.289 --> 02:38.519
- That is true. That is absolutely true.
- And what would happen?

02:38.591 --> 02:42.891
We would almost get raped and/or murdered
and/or stabbed by crackheads in Fairmount Park.

02:42.962 --> 02:45.123
You wanna know what else
what would happen?

02:45.198 --> 02:48.690
We drove Nicky Potnik's car
into a tree on Kelly Drive.

02:48.768 --> 02:53.467
With Sweet Dee in the backseat puking because
some guy talked to her that she liked, remember?

02:53.540 --> 02:55.701
Every time some guy
talks to you that you like...

02:55.775 --> 02:58.005
you get so nervous
you drink yourself into oblivion.

02:58.077 --> 03:00.045
- I had bad potato salad.
- You drink yourself crazy.

03:00.113 --> 03:02.104
You abused alcohol, and that's okay.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.844
But it's very dangerous, right?
Right? Okay.

03:04.918 --> 03:08.979
Well, maybe we should look at this
whole thing from a different angle.

03:09.055 --> 03:13.856
Maybe we have "a social responsibility"
to provide a safe haven...

03:13.927 --> 03:16.623
for these kids to be kids.

03:16.696 --> 03:19.221
- You know, experiment.
- No. I don't like where this is heading.

03:19.299 --> 03:21.790
- We would have to set up ground rules.
- Okay.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.302
No drinking and driving.
No one's gonna crash Nicky Potnik's car.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.338
- Right.
- Everyone has to take a cab.

03:26.406 --> 03:29.807
Four drink maximum. Like, that's it.
You know what I mean?

03:29.876 --> 03:33.334
Yeah, yeah. That's it.
Anyone causing trouble can't come.

03:33.413 --> 03:36.143
- If you're gonna be here, you gotta be cool.
- He's gone! He's gone!

03:36.216 --> 03:38.707
Listen, we water down the drinks,
jack up the prices.

03:38.785 --> 03:41.583
- Oh, my... Come on!
- We could make a serious profit off these kids.

03:41.654 --> 03:43.918
And they'd have no idea
what the hell's going on.

03:43.990 --> 03:47.323
- We would actually be doing something good.
- Great. I say we do it.

03:47.393 --> 03:50.726
- Yeah.
- I don't know how you guys live with yourselves.

03:50.797 --> 03:54.198
- One day at a time.
- One day at a time.

03:54.267 --> 03:57.065
<i>Yeah, I know, Mom.
I heard you the first time.</i>

03:57.136 --> 04:00.537
I'm perfectly aware of what time it is.
Thank you, Mom.

04:00.607 --> 04:03.075
Do we have to do this right now?

04:03.142 --> 04:07.101
Yeah, I know how old I am. Did you think
that I forgot, maybe, how old... That's...

04:07.180 --> 04:10.775
As a matter of fact, I have a date
this afternoon with my friend Steven.

04:10.850 --> 04:13.910
So I should probably go,
'cause I gotta get ready for that.

04:13.987 --> 04:17.478
Mm-hmm.
All right. Yeah, you too. Bye.

04:23.229 --> 04:25.163
Hello, Steven.

04:28.234 --> 04:30.429
Hello.

04:30.503 --> 04:32.403
- Dee?
- Yeah.

04:32.472 --> 04:34.906
- This is Trey from last night.
- Oh, hey, Trey.

04:34.974 --> 04:37.408
You know what? I don't think
I should be talking with you.

04:37.477 --> 04:42.346
I think you're the most beautiful woman
I've ever met in my entire life.

04:42.415 --> 04:44.349
Really?

04:44.417 --> 04:47.477
I can't believe that someone as gorgeous
as you can be so down to earth.

04:47.553 --> 04:51.011
Well, you know, I've always tried to
keep both feet on the ground, so...

04:51.090 --> 04:53.115
Yeah. So, listen,
I have a lacrosse game...

04:53.192 --> 04:56.628
but I was wondering if you wanted to meet me
and my friends at Lemon Hill afterwards.

04:56.696 --> 04:59.563
Lemon Hill?
That's where all the cool kids used to go.

04:59.632 --> 05:02.965
- Good. So you've been there.
- Oh! Come on.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.163
I've been there, like, 200 times.

05:05.238 --> 05:09.231
Why don't you stop by? I mean, unless
you got something better to do today.

05:17.350 --> 05:20.012
Wow. You can really put 'em back,
can't you?

05:20.086 --> 05:23.146
The trick is to
just kind of open your throat.

05:23.222 --> 05:26.248
You are so much cooler
than all the other girls I know.

05:26.326 --> 05:30.092
You are so sweet.
Can you get me another one of these?

05:30.163 --> 05:32.461
<i>Whoo!</i>

05:32.532 --> 05:35.194
<i>- All right. There you go.
- Look how much fun they're having, man.</i>

05:35.268 --> 05:37.759
Of course they are. They haven't
realized how much life sucks yet.

05:37.837 --> 05:41.136
Remember how great high school was?
All those parties, no responsibilities.

05:41.207 --> 05:44.199
- High school was the best.
- Do you guys even remember high school?

05:44.277 --> 05:46.973
- I don't think it happened the way you think.
- What do you mean?

05:47.046 --> 05:50.607
The only reason you got to hang out
with me and the other cool kids...

05:50.683 --> 05:52.617
is 'cause you sold us all weed.

05:52.685 --> 05:55.415
- Everybody thought you were an asshole.
- I was popular!

05:55.488 --> 05:58.787
Mac was very popular. And I like to think
I was pretty popular myself.

05:58.858 --> 06:02.692
<i>- You were.
- No, he was. You were popular like a clown is popular.</i>

06:02.762 --> 06:04.753
- What?
- Yeah, you made us all laugh.

06:04.831 --> 06:06.958
All the guys knew you couldn't sleep
with their girlfriends.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.695
Whatever, dude. The only reason
you got laid is 'cause you dated freshmen.

06:09.769 --> 06:11.964
Yeah. You've always had
that creepy thing with younger girls.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.734
- I do not.
- You're not in high school anymore, pal.

06:14.807 --> 06:17.401
You better keep it in the pants,
'cause it's kind of creepy.

06:17.477 --> 06:19.411
You want to talk about creepy?

06:19.479 --> 06:22.414
You guys sniffing glue in your mom's
basement. That's creepy.

06:25.485 --> 06:27.476
Tim Murphy slept with your prom date.

06:27.553 --> 06:30.317
<i>Tim Murphy slept with your prom date!</i>

06:30.390 --> 06:32.381
- Tim Murphy had sex with your prom date!
- That's right.

06:33.893 --> 06:37.556
<i>- Oh. He's getting sad now.
- Oh, no.</i>

06:37.630 --> 06:39.723
- There's, like, watering in the eyes.
- Now he's running away.

06:39.799 --> 06:42.393
<i>Oh, is he gonna cry?</i>

06:42.468 --> 06:47.167
Did you see that? He was totally gonna cry.

06:49.742 --> 06:52.302
Oh, Trey, that is so sad.

06:52.378 --> 06:55.506
It was a really bad breakup.

06:55.581 --> 06:59.073
I mean, Tammy's great and all.
I just wasn't feeling it, you know?

06:59.152 --> 07:02.485
Oh, yeah. Well, you gotta feel it.

07:02.555 --> 07:05.615
Don't get me wrong.
Tammy's, like, the prettiest girl in school...

07:05.691 --> 07:07.682
so it was a perfect match.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.456
- It just wasn't working.
- Hmm.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.464
She's not as pretty as you though.

07:12.532 --> 07:16.332
Oh! Thank you.

07:19.639 --> 07:23.837
Wait! I can't do this.

07:23.910 --> 07:27.869
- What?
- I never statutory raped anyone before.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.939
Oh. Okay. I'll tell you what.

07:31.017 --> 07:34.282
Let's, uh, just take it slow.

07:34.353 --> 07:36.913
You are so sweet.

07:36.989 --> 07:39.651
Where were you
when I was in high school?

07:39.725 --> 07:41.659
I was eight.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.454
Right.

07:45.531 --> 07:47.897
Yeah.

07:50.002 --> 07:52.732
These kids are wasted, bro.
I thought we were cuttin' 'em off.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.638
I am cuttin' 'em off. These kids haven't
had more than three drinks each.

07:55.708 --> 07:58.939
Plus, there's so much water, they're probably
more hydrated than they ever have been.

07:59.011 --> 08:01.571
- Are they fakin' it?
- I guess.

08:01.647 --> 08:05.242
<i>- Just stay away from me, Billy!
- No, Sara! I saw you flirting with him!</i>

08:05.318 --> 08:07.650
<i>No, I know it.
You were throwing yourself on him!</i>

08:07.720 --> 08:10.553
Hey, hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

08:10.623 --> 08:13.456
Give me some eyes!
Look at me! Cool your jets!

08:13.526 --> 08:16.324
- I'm sorry.
- All right, beat it!

08:16.395 --> 08:18.590
- Are you okay?
- He's such a player.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.155
- Is he a player?
- Big time.

08:21.234 --> 08:24.863
I hate players. All right. I'm sorry.
I'm getting fired up here.

08:24.937 --> 08:27.428
Charlie, that was the coolest thing
you've ever done!

08:27.507 --> 08:29.475
I know. I'm gonna be sick.

08:37.316 --> 08:40.774
- Oh, shit.
- You Dennis Reynolds?

08:40.852 --> 08:43.754
- Yeah.
- You like what you see?

08:43.823 --> 08:46.018
Uh, I don't know.

08:46.092 --> 08:49.323
Dude, relax. I'm 18.

08:49.395 --> 08:51.454
- Are you in high school?
- Yes.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.091
- Then take a hike.
- Doesn't seem to bother your sister.

08:54.166 --> 08:56.066
What?

08:56.135 --> 08:59.832
She was all over this one boy
in my class today.

08:59.906 --> 09:01.840
Really?

09:01.908 --> 09:04.069
Listen, dude, I'm legal...

09:04.143 --> 09:06.475
and I love to party.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.106
So if you're looking for
the ride of your life...

09:09.181 --> 09:11.945
give me a call.

09:16.856 --> 09:19.125
Goddamn it.

09:19.258 --> 09:22.091
<i>Hang on. I'm coming!</i>

09:22.161 --> 09:24.391
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- What?

09:24.463 --> 09:27.261
I know you were hanging out with
that high school kid from the bar.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.858
Okay. You know what?
We're just friends, all right?

09:29.935 --> 09:34.031
He went through a really bad breakup,
and he just needed me to be there for him.

09:34.106 --> 09:36.131
What you're doing is sick and wrong.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.199
Are you living out
some sad fantasy of yours?

09:38.277 --> 09:41.542
- Going out with the most popular kid in high school.
- Why would that be a fantasy?

09:41.614 --> 09:43.605
I went out with tons of guys
in high school.

09:43.682 --> 09:46.150
You wore that scoliosis back brace
until you were 20 years old.

09:46.218 --> 09:48.209
- Everyone was afraid of you.
- No, they weren't.

09:48.287 --> 09:51.848
- You looked like a monster! Do you all have amnesia?
- What is that supposed to mean?

09:51.924 --> 09:54.654
Oh, my God. You're as delusional
as Mac and Charlie.

09:54.727 --> 09:57.560
Do not compare me to Mac and Charlie.

09:57.630 --> 10:00.394
I'm telling you,
this is the wrong kind of glue, Charlie.

10:00.466 --> 10:03.458
- No, it's not.
- This is made for, like, kindergartners or something.

10:03.536 --> 10:06.699
- No, this will work.
- No, look. "Nontoxic and safe."

10:06.772 --> 10:09.104
We don't want safe. We want toxic.

10:09.175 --> 10:11.735
- Something's happening.
- Nothing is gonna happen.

10:11.810 --> 10:14.278
- Something's happening.
- Nothing's gonna happen.

10:14.346 --> 10:16.337
No, you're right. This isn't working.

10:19.485 --> 10:22.977
Y'ello. Yeah.

10:23.055 --> 10:25.546
Oh, hey. How are you?

10:27.059 --> 10:30.825
Really? That's cool.

10:30.896 --> 10:33.888
Yeah. Okay.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.900
Bye.

10:35.968 --> 10:38.960
Dude. That was that girl Sara,
the one from the bar the other night...

10:39.038 --> 10:41.029
who I rescued from that kid.

10:41.106 --> 10:45.065
Well, her parents are out of town,
and she's totally having a party.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.738
What do you think?

10:54.853 --> 10:57.219
Kind of a lame party, bro.

10:57.289 --> 10:59.519
Uh, what do you think?
Should we jet?

10:59.592 --> 11:01.583
Yeah. This doesn't feel right.

11:01.660 --> 11:04.891
<i>Hey, guys!</i>

11:04.964 --> 11:07.023
- Hi, Sara.
- Hey.

11:07.099 --> 11:09.260
I'm so glad you guys came.

11:09.335 --> 11:12.168
Well, uh, we ran into
a little bit of a problem.

11:12.238 --> 11:16.231
My brother, he was supposed to
pick up the keg, but he bailed on me.

11:16.308 --> 11:19.869
- Oh, that sucks.
- Yeah. Yeah, it totally sucks.

11:19.945 --> 11:23.574
So, um, we were wondering
if maybe you guys could help us out.

11:25.384 --> 11:27.750
- Oh, you mean... No, I don't...
- Ooh, no.

11:27.820 --> 11:30.050
Geez, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

11:30.122 --> 11:33.353
Listen, it's one thing at the bar, you know,
where we have control over you guys.

11:33.425 --> 11:36.417
- It's another thing...
- Ah, come on, please? Please.

11:36.495 --> 11:40.329
- You guys have been so cool.
- Yeah, we were just talking about how cool you guys were.

11:40.399 --> 11:43.061
- Really?
- You were?

11:43.135 --> 11:46.127
Mm-hmm. This would be the coolest thing
that anyone's ever done for us.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.139
- Ever.
- Ever.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.470
Who wants to do a keg stand?

12:04.556 --> 12:07.821
<i>Um, I'm kind ofhaving
second thoughts a little bit.</i>

12:07.893 --> 12:10.521
Oh, come on. It'll be a blast.

12:10.596 --> 12:14.657
Yeah, well, I don't think
your friends like me that much.

12:14.733 --> 12:18.430
<i>Let's go get a beer.</i>

12:18.504 --> 12:20.404
Twenty-five, 26...

12:20.472 --> 12:23.703
27, 28, 29!

12:30.683 --> 12:33.880
- Hey, Dee.
- Hi, guys.

12:37.056 --> 12:40.457
- What's going on?
- Just hanging out, you know?

12:40.526 --> 12:42.494
Yeah.

12:42.561 --> 12:45.359
Wanna do a keg stand?

12:45.431 --> 12:49.424
Seventy-five, 76, 77!

12:52.638 --> 12:56.540
- Seventy-seven seconds! That is a
new record, baby! - I did it. I did it.

12:56.608 --> 12:59.372
So, Ben is, like,
"I don't care what Kevin said, Sara.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.936
I was only going out with Rachel
to get closer to you."

13:02.014 --> 13:05.745
Oh, my... Oh, my God.
What did you say to that?

13:05.818 --> 13:09.549
"Whatever, Ben. I heard from Caitlin
that you were totally into her."

13:09.621 --> 13:13.751
Um, he's so full of shit.

13:15.127 --> 13:18.494
<i>Goddamn!</i>

13:18.564 --> 13:21.124
Come on. Oh, come on.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.438
Yeah! What do you think
about that, bitches?

13:26.505 --> 13:29.406
<i>Load 'em up, losers!
What do you think about this, huh?</i>

13:29.475 --> 13:32.501
How I embarrassed your boyfriend
in front of everybody? You like that?

13:32.578 --> 13:34.944
- You like what you see?
- What's with this guy?

13:35.013 --> 13:38.107
I know. What is he, like, 40?

13:38.183 --> 13:41.152
Get me some more! Get me some more!
Let's go! Load 'em up!

13:41.220 --> 13:44.986
- I'm gonna put on a goddamn clinic!
- What an asshole.

13:56.268 --> 14:01.205
Come on, guys. Hey.
Let's go. Let's go!

14:01.273 --> 14:04.140
- Oh, get off me, dude!
- Get off me!

14:04.209 --> 14:06.677
Can we please get out of here?
Let's go.

14:06.745 --> 14:08.372
Why?

14:08.447 --> 14:12.076
Trey asked me to prom last night.
This is getting really weird.

14:12.151 --> 14:14.619
- That girl Sara asked me too.
- You're kidding!

14:14.686 --> 14:17.814
What? No, we can't go to the prom.
That's pathetic.

14:17.890 --> 14:20.051
What do you mean "we"?
Who asked you?

14:23.061 --> 14:25.052
Let's just go. Let's just go.

14:27.065 --> 14:27.861
All right, all right. I'm coming.

14:30.002 --> 14:33.369
- Hi, sexy.
- What are you doing here? You gotta get out of here.

14:33.439 --> 14:36.636
I need a date for the prom,
and I want you to take me.

14:36.708 --> 14:39.905
Are you kidding me?
I can't do that, okay?

14:39.978 --> 14:44.039
- You gotta go.
- Isn't there anything I can do to change your mind?

14:46.018 --> 14:49.078
No. No, no, no. No.
Leave. Leave. Go.

14:49.154 --> 14:51.714
Okay. You can either
take me to the prom...

14:51.790 --> 14:54.623
or I can tell the police
that you're serving underage kids.

14:54.693 --> 14:57.059
- Are you serious?
- Try me.

15:02.468 --> 15:04.459
Goddamn it.

15:04.536 --> 15:07.027
You know what? I don't think we
should be serving minors anymore.

15:07.105 --> 15:10.666
- Oh, no. Somebody's jealous.
- I'm not jealous. I just think it's dangerous.

15:10.742 --> 15:13.870
<i>- You're jealous you didn't get asked to the prom.
- I don't care about that.</i>

15:13.946 --> 15:17.006
- Ah, you're gonna cry?
- Shut up!

15:17.082 --> 15:21.314
Yo, you guys?
No more kids in the bar, seriously.

15:21.386 --> 15:24.480
- Okay! Now we're talking some sense.
- What the hell?

15:24.556 --> 15:27.320
- This girl asked me to the prom.
- What?

15:27.392 --> 15:29.917
Yeah. This girl
comes over to my house...

15:29.995 --> 15:34.125
tells me that if I don't go to the prom with her,
she's gonna rat us out to the cops.

15:34.199 --> 15:37.293
Wait a second. Hold on.
So all of you guys got asked to the prom?

15:37.369 --> 15:40.338
You guys got asked to the prom?

15:40.405 --> 15:42.270
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

15:42.341 --> 15:44.502
Oh, this is so lame!

15:44.576 --> 15:47.204
At least you don't actually have to go.

15:47.279 --> 15:50.214
- Are you going?
- Yeah. I have to.

15:50.282 --> 15:53.342
Oh, well, if you're going,
I'm going then, I guess.

15:53.418 --> 15:55.352
- So you...
- What?

15:55.420 --> 15:58.719
I didn't get to go when I was in high school.
It might actually be fun.

15:58.790 --> 16:01.122
<i>If you guys are going, I'm going.
I'm not staying here.</i>

16:01.193 --> 16:03.127
- Are you gonna go?
- I'm gonna go.

16:03.195 --> 16:05.060
- I have to go, so...
- You guys are pathetic!

16:05.130 --> 16:07.496
Maybe if you weren't such a jerk,
someone might have asked you.

16:07.566 --> 16:11.161
Because Sara told me that Maureen told her
that Regina McGinley thought you were cute.

16:11.236 --> 16:14.262
- Then Ray Rafferty comes up to you at the party, and you're...
- Charlie, shut up!

16:14.339 --> 16:18.435
The only reason that Sara asked you in the
first place is because you're the only idiot...

16:18.510 --> 16:21.968
dumb enough to listen to her bitch
about her ex-boyfriend all night!

16:22.047 --> 16:24.208
Whatever.

16:25.717 --> 16:28.584
Hey, we should have a pre-prom party.

16:30.522 --> 16:32.513
You know what, Charlie?

16:32.591 --> 16:34.821
I think this is actually
gonna be pretty great.

16:34.893 --> 16:37.225
Oh, dude, are you kidding me?
This is gonna be awesome.

16:37.296 --> 16:40.322
- I can't wait to just get out there and start dancing.
- I'm gonna dance too.

16:40.399 --> 16:43.425
- Are you gonna dance, baby? You gonna dance with me?
- I'm gonna dance like this.

16:43.502 --> 16:47.438
Oh, Dee! Come here.
Let me take a look at you.

16:47.506 --> 16:50.600
Wow. You look... You look... Yeah.

16:50.676 --> 16:55.340
I know. I feel so lucky
that this thing even fits still.

16:55.414 --> 16:59.475
- Is that your dress from high school?
- Yup.

16:59.551 --> 17:03.009
- You didn't go to the prom in high school, Dee.
- No, I know.

17:03.088 --> 17:06.751
My back brace was under the dress,
and Mom called me fat.

17:06.825 --> 17:08.917
So I stayed home and cried instead.

17:08.993 --> 17:11.394
Take... Take it slow. Take it slow.

17:11.463 --> 17:14.454
<i>I know, you guys,
but I just am so nervous.</i>

17:14.532 --> 17:17.023
I just want this whole night
to be so special.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.570
That dude is going to
bang your sister, bro.

17:21.640 --> 17:24.632
- What's up, bitches? Mmm!
- What is this? What are you doing?

17:24.710 --> 17:27.906
You assholes aren't gonna be the only ones
having fun. I'm going to the prom.

17:27.980 --> 17:32.576
- Dork! You cannot crash a high school prom.
- I'm going stag, bro.

17:32.651 --> 17:34.778
Mac, you are so pathetic.

17:34.853 --> 17:37.617
Yes, and your eyebrows
are drawn on, so...

17:37.689 --> 17:40.055
Whoa. Well, you know what?

17:40.125 --> 17:42.252
How 'bout this?

17:42.327 --> 17:44.352
Say it, don't spray it.

17:44.429 --> 17:47.057
<i>Trey's here. Oh, my God.</i>

17:47.132 --> 17:51.796
Hello. Excuse me, Mac.
My date has arrived.

17:51.870 --> 17:55.101
Trey is so cool.

17:55.173 --> 17:57.698
He's totally gonna bang your sister.

17:58.944 --> 18:01.606
Hello, sweet prince.

18:01.680 --> 18:05.411
Wow! You look... good.

18:05.484 --> 18:07.952
I know! Like a princess.

18:08.020 --> 18:11.319
- Can I tell you a little secret?
- Sure.

18:11.390 --> 18:13.324
Beat it.

18:15.527 --> 18:19.759
- I always wanted to have sex on prom.
- Ah.

18:19.831 --> 18:22.493
All right. So what's the plan?
Do we have a limo or what?

18:22.567 --> 18:25.297
- The plan is, you're not coming with us.
- Yeah.

18:25.370 --> 18:27.838
- Why not?
- You weren't invited and you don't have a date.

18:27.906 --> 18:29.897
- You totally suck.
- I totally suck?

18:29.975 --> 18:31.966
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Oh, Jesus.

18:34.379 --> 18:36.677
Oh, who is that?

18:36.748 --> 18:39.308
- That's my prom date.
- Mm-hmm.

18:39.384 --> 18:41.909
She's unbelievable.
How old is she?

18:41.987 --> 18:43.887
- She's 18.
- Eighteen?

18:43.955 --> 18:46.446
- You are a lucky man. You are a lucky man.
- Oh, you dick!

18:46.525 --> 18:49.756
Wait a second. You guys called me creepy
for liking young chicks.

18:49.828 --> 18:52.388
Eighteen's legal, bro.
This isn't a morality contest.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.523
Eighteen's not young, brother.

18:54.599 --> 18:58.000
- So you guys are giving me the
go-ahead? I mean, can I... - Go ahead.

18:58.070 --> 19:00.334
- Hi, Dennis.
- Hi.

19:00.405 --> 19:03.897
- You look...
- Yeah, I know.

19:03.975 --> 19:06.944
- Do ya?
- Mm-hmm.

19:07.012 --> 19:11.449
- I can't zip it up. Your hair's all caught.
- All right. Just pull it.

19:11.516 --> 19:13.814
Oh.

19:15.620 --> 19:18.088
- Tammy?
- Mm-mmm. No. What?

19:18.156 --> 19:21.057
Hold on one minute.

19:21.126 --> 19:23.651
- Can I get you a drink?
- Maybe.

19:23.729 --> 19:26.061
- What would you like?
- Anything you want.

19:26.131 --> 19:29.931
- Tammy, what are you doing here?
- I'm picking up my date.

19:30.001 --> 19:32.162
You're going to prom with this guy?

19:32.237 --> 19:34.899
Yes.

19:34.973 --> 19:37.271
Can I talk to you for a second?

19:37.342 --> 19:39.606
What the hell is going on?

19:39.678 --> 19:42.203
That's Tammy, Trey's ex-girlfriend.

19:42.280 --> 19:44.510
This is classic Tammy.

19:44.583 --> 19:46.915
Trey broke up with Tammy
because Maureen Kinallen said...

19:46.985 --> 19:49.419
that she saw Tammy flirting
with Walt Timby at a party.

19:49.488 --> 19:52.184
But she was only doing it
to make Trey jealous because, you know...

19:52.257 --> 19:54.248
she thought that Trey
secretly liked Erin Hannabry.

19:54.326 --> 19:56.954
But Trey didn't like Erin Hannabry.
It was all a bunch of bull.

19:57.028 --> 19:59.861
- What is happening?
- That's Tammy, Trey's ex-girlfriend.

19:59.931 --> 20:02.866
This is classic Tammy.
Trey broke up with Tammy...

20:02.934 --> 20:05.528
Charlie, you gotta stop, honestly.

20:05.604 --> 20:08.573
<i>- What are they talking about?
- Whoa!</i>

20:10.041 --> 20:13.033
<i>- Where are they going?
- What the hell is this?</i>

20:13.111 --> 20:16.774
Oh, man! Ah, they did it.
They got what they wanted.

20:16.848 --> 20:19.840
- This is bullshit.
- So wait a second.

20:19.918 --> 20:21.909
They were actually using you two...

20:21.987 --> 20:24.012
to make each other jealous.

20:24.089 --> 20:27.547
I always knew that they'd wind up together,
'cause they're, like, so perfect for each other.

20:27.626 --> 20:30.117
- Shut up, Charlie!
- They're one of those perfect matches.

20:30.195 --> 20:33.028
- That dude's gonna bang your prom date, bro.
- Stop saying it!

20:33.098 --> 20:35.931
- It's not funny!
- Hey, why are you such an asshole all the time?

20:36.001 --> 20:39.232
I'm not the asshole. You guys are the ones
that just got dumped on prom night.

20:39.304 --> 20:41.738
- You got dumped on prom night!
- You were gonna go stag.

20:41.807 --> 20:44.207
- Yes, I was. Absolutely.
- How old are you, dude?

20:44.276 --> 20:46.506
- I am 28 years old.
- You're a piece of crap!

20:46.578 --> 20:49.570
- I'm not a piece of crap! You're a piece of crap.
- I have to pee.

20:49.648 --> 20:51.775
Stop it. Go pee.

20:53.952 --> 20:55.886
I hate you, Charlie.

20:57.522 --> 20:59.513
Just like high school.
