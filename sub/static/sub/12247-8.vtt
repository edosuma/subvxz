WEBVTT

00:03.859 --> 00:05.851
I think they're trying to
pull a surprise witness.

00:05.857 --> 00:07.464
- I don't know who it is.
- I do.

00:07.469 --> 00:10.134
We'd like you to submit
a written statement

00:10.140 --> 00:12.918
and to appear in court
for cross-examination.

00:12.924 --> 00:14.124
Okay.

00:14.130 --> 00:16.675
I know that wasn't the
sentence you were hoping for.

00:16.681 --> 00:20.011
You will have 12 long
years with Bea Smith.

00:20.017 --> 00:23.086
Fuck you! Fuck!

00:23.381 --> 00:26.046
I'm angry at the fucker
who put me in here.

00:26.052 --> 00:28.185
I've decided to have the operation.

00:28.509 --> 00:30.965
You take care of
Jesper, I'll handle her.

00:30.971 --> 00:33.506
- What are you gonna do?
- Kill Bea Smith.

00:33.512 --> 00:34.885
I'm not gay.

00:35.141 --> 00:36.696
I don't care what you are.

00:36.930 --> 00:38.383
You care about me.

00:38.857 --> 00:40.445
We should get back for the count.

02:10.466 --> 02:11.776
I'm done.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.674
Hey, thank you!

02:13.680 --> 02:15.031
Thank you! You're the

02:15.037 --> 02:17.256
- best. Thank you.
- You're a legend!

02:18.176 --> 02:19.377
Thanks!

02:19.855 --> 02:21.549
Thanks, babe.

02:26.670 --> 02:28.013
Look at Dors.

02:28.019 --> 02:30.052
I bet you she's real bored.

02:30.193 --> 02:32.810
- She looks bored, eh?
- Yeah, she does.

02:32.816 --> 02:36.397
Well, I hear Kaz makes 20
minute speeches, every day.

02:36.403 --> 02:39.334
- What about? Mm.
- Power and oppression.

02:39.825 --> 02:42.674
You reckon Dors has got
post-natal oppression or somethin'?

02:44.968 --> 02:49.563
No, mate, its post-natal
de-pression, not op-pression.

02:49.569 --> 02:52.102
- Well, has she got it or what?
- No, no.

03:26.806 --> 03:30.209
So, uh, you can see I made the
equipment room real nice for ya.

03:30.215 --> 03:31.482
You shouldn't have.

03:45.947 --> 03:47.483
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

03:47.488 --> 03:49.281
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

03:50.036 --> 03:52.422
It's too soon for that.
I... I... I got it.

03:52.428 --> 03:55.122
No, no, no, no, it-it's
not too soon. I... ah...

03:57.315 --> 03:59.034
But I don't know what to do.

04:00.588 --> 04:01.788
Okay.

04:03.588 --> 04:06.387
Well, do you wanna, just
um, sit down for a bit?

04:06.393 --> 04:07.593
Yeah.

04:08.065 --> 04:09.639
Yeah. That'd be good.

04:17.994 --> 04:19.798
So, how's your day been?

04:20.853 --> 04:22.552
Dispense any justice?

04:23.596 --> 04:25.371
If-if I wanna just talk,

04:25.377 --> 04:27.592
- that's gonna to be okay?
- No, no, it is, it is.

04:27.598 --> 04:28.981
It is, of course it is.

04:35.165 --> 04:38.940
So, what were you into, before all this?

04:38.946 --> 04:42.219
Mmmm, what do you mean?

04:43.126 --> 04:44.745
What do you think I mean?

04:44.751 --> 04:45.951
I don't know.

04:46.622 --> 04:49.028
- What were you into?
- I was into you.

04:57.315 --> 05:00.290
Ahh. All of a sudden I feel
like I've got two left hands.

05:00.296 --> 05:02.783
- Like I've...
- Okay. All right. Let's cut a deal.

05:03.588 --> 05:04.788
Just kissing.

05:05.113 --> 05:07.137
No hands, left or right.

05:10.027 --> 05:11.227
Okay.

05:20.544 --> 05:22.185
- My God.
- _

05:22.191 --> 05:23.796
- I can't believe we're doing this.
- _

05:23.802 --> 05:26.299
I know, I spent the whole of
lunch trying not to look at you.

05:31.585 --> 05:32.918
That's out.

05:32.924 --> 05:34.124
Fucking get it.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.231
Pass. Pass!

05:44.755 --> 05:46.752
I know now, how to do it.

05:48.068 --> 05:49.269
Bea?

05:49.275 --> 05:51.495
It's better if you don't
know too many details.

05:51.715 --> 05:55.095
When the time comes I may need
you to perform certain functions.

05:55.905 --> 05:57.105
Like what?

05:57.372 --> 06:02.269
The Red Right Hand have never actually
killed someone. It's not what we do.

06:02.560 --> 06:04.061
We agreed on this.

06:09.263 --> 06:11.090
She's taken 12 years from you.

06:11.095 --> 06:12.829
And for your women, that's
their child bearing years.

06:12.834 --> 06:15.522
That's just... just
gone. Their lives stolen.

06:15.528 --> 06:18.446
If it were not for her, none
of us would be in prison at all.

06:21.708 --> 06:23.324
Don't you want justice for them?

06:28.958 --> 06:30.425
Oh, play it, play it, play it!

06:30.430 --> 06:31.954
Yeah! Throw it!

06:33.359 --> 06:35.399
Fuck, oh fuck.

06:37.953 --> 06:40.820
- What do you want?
- I'd like a word, please.

06:40.824 --> 06:43.024
Piss off, you long piece of shit.

06:43.029 --> 06:44.762
I would like to make an enquiry.

06:44.768 --> 06:47.213
I'm interested in your uh, service.

06:47.219 --> 06:49.046
Well, we don't deal with governors.

06:49.052 --> 06:50.532
Well, I'm not a governor anymore.

06:50.538 --> 06:52.224
Doesn't matter. Fuck off!

06:52.673 --> 06:54.764
Wait. Wait.

06:55.943 --> 06:57.143
Stand there.

06:58.298 --> 07:02.079
Consider it a goodwill gesture.
And know I'm prepared to triple it.

07:02.274 --> 07:03.798
That's three times.

07:04.028 --> 07:07.449
- What do you want?
- Rohypnol. Preferably six tablets.

07:09.152 --> 07:10.355
It's technically known as

07:10.361 --> 07:11.934
- Flunitrazepam.
- Roofies?

07:12.147 --> 07:14.728
- You want roofies?
- Is that something you can access?

07:14.734 --> 07:15.934
Maybe.

07:16.218 --> 07:18.218
But that would be quadruple.

07:18.706 --> 07:20.695
That's four...

07:20.947 --> 07:22.274
times.

07:23.924 --> 07:25.124
Ha.

07:25.130 --> 07:27.359
Speak tomorrow. Maybe.

07:27.365 --> 07:28.641
No maybe. We will.

07:30.006 --> 07:32.030
And as Maxie's, um....

07:32.506 --> 07:33.721
oh...

07:35.575 --> 07:37.874
- support person...
- Mmm-hm.

07:37.888 --> 07:40.668
I would help the nurses at the hospital

07:40.674 --> 07:43.368
and the screws... and the... oh...

07:43.374 --> 07:44.766
- officers.
- Mmm-hm.

07:44.772 --> 07:48.128
And, ah, but really, I'd just
be wanting to hold Maxie's hand

07:48.134 --> 07:51.742
and, you know, just...
just bein' strong.

07:52.158 --> 07:55.395
But you-you wouldn't want to
be alone with this kinda stuff.

07:55.401 --> 07:56.847
Maxie wouldn't deserve that.

07:58.150 --> 07:59.796
- Okay.
- Okay.

07:59.802 --> 08:01.100
- Thank you, Jenkins.
- Yeah.

08:01.104 --> 08:03.215
- That was very sincere.
- Yes.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.934
- Yeah, yeah.
- And considered. And I will contact

08:06.940 --> 08:09.086
- the regional director immediately.
- Oh!

08:09.092 --> 08:10.758
- Yeah.
- Okay? But I...

08:10.764 --> 08:13.484
I'm just suggesting you keep
your expectation's in check.

08:13.490 --> 08:15.310
- That's all.
- Yep.

08:16.011 --> 08:18.445
Okay. Well, um, uh, thank you...

08:18.451 --> 08:22.178
Thank you for listening to... and
thinking about everything I said....

08:22.184 --> 08:25.756
Oh no! I had more stuff.
Um, it's... it's stuff that

08:25.762 --> 08:27.222
- Lizzie told me. And it's...
- Yeah, no, thanks.

08:27.227 --> 08:29.622
No, you conveyed your point perfectly.

08:29.628 --> 08:32.106
Y... yeah?

08:34.182 --> 08:36.486
- Yeah. Should I...?
- Yep.

08:47.070 --> 08:49.241
Is it really that unlikely?

08:50.053 --> 08:53.648
The history of Wentworth
inmates in public hospitals is,

08:53.654 --> 08:56.046
to put it mildly, unfortunate.

08:56.052 --> 08:57.427
Did they say anything?

08:57.433 --> 08:58.897
Yeah, they said... oh, they said

08:58.903 --> 09:00.498
- they gotta talk to Channing.
- Okay.

09:00.503 --> 09:02.065
But, is that even real Bea? Like,

09:02.071 --> 09:04.454
- or is that just somethin' they say?
- No, no, it's...

09:04.460 --> 09:06.048
- it's probably real, Booms.
- Yeah.

09:06.053 --> 09:08.137
- Yeah. Well I didn't cry,
- Yeah.

09:08.143 --> 09:10.466
- so that's good. Yeah.
- That is good, love.

09:10.472 --> 09:12.571
- Yeah.
- Even if they say no,

09:13.142 --> 09:15.366
I'll remember how hard you tried.

09:16.127 --> 09:18.230
Okay? It means the world to me.

09:19.057 --> 09:21.090
- Oh.
- Shit.

09:21.174 --> 09:23.332
- Oh. Oh, no.
- Oh, honey.

09:23.338 --> 09:25.217
- Oh, darlin'.
- It's okay! I'm okay!

09:25.223 --> 09:26.519
Come on, let's pack bags.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.500
It's still two days away, Booms.

09:28.506 --> 09:29.889
Yeah, we're gonna
practice-pack. Come on.

09:29.894 --> 09:31.394
Yeah, yeah. That's a good idea.

09:31.735 --> 09:32.941
Go on.

09:45.357 --> 09:47.825
- You all right, Sonia?
- I'm fine.

09:49.028 --> 09:51.186
- Thank you.
- It can get a little bit upsetting

09:51.192 --> 09:53.654
can't it, all that talk
about cancer, and....

09:53.660 --> 09:55.488
But you know what, don't be embarrassed,

09:55.494 --> 09:58.374
because you are lookin' at
the biggest sook in the prison.

09:59.193 --> 10:01.265
I lost my husband to cancer.

10:01.271 --> 10:05.426
Oh God. I'm sorry I... I had no idea.

10:08.104 --> 10:09.864
- How long ago?
- Seven years!

10:09.870 --> 10:11.214
Seven years this August.

10:11.793 --> 10:14.108
- How old was he?
- Fifty-seven.

10:14.356 --> 10:15.561
That's awful.

10:15.567 --> 10:19.655
The hardest part was that he disappeared
so I never got a chance to say goodbye.

10:20.773 --> 10:22.234
Disappeared?

10:22.240 --> 10:24.515
He didn't want me to see him suffer.

10:26.889 --> 10:29.649
Anyway, you should be
back with the ladies.

10:29.655 --> 10:33.070
Yeah. If ever you wanna
have a chat with a sook...

10:54.669 --> 10:56.629
Yeah, I'd take anything you can give.

10:57.192 --> 10:58.584
I know you would.

11:06.351 --> 11:07.630
Got the money?

11:08.232 --> 11:10.413
I'd like to see the tablets first.

11:11.537 --> 11:13.888
Money... first.

11:37.375 --> 11:39.281
Mmm, don't, don't, don't, don't.

11:39.287 --> 11:41.208
Don't, no, I need to go. I need to...

11:42.310 --> 11:43.631
I have to go.

11:44.068 --> 11:46.194
And this time it's not an
excuse. I really do have to go.

11:46.199 --> 11:48.134
Just 20 more seconds.

11:48.347 --> 11:50.227
Okay. Okay, 10.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.060
You actually working
towards telling anyone?

11:54.570 --> 11:56.949
Or did you think we were
going to stay in here forever,

11:57.519 --> 11:59.005
making out in the closet?

12:01.378 --> 12:02.986
It's difficult for me.

12:04.011 --> 12:06.345
Well, it's not exactly easy for me.

12:06.351 --> 12:10.071
I'd be telling my entire crew I'm
with the person that shopped us, so...

12:10.077 --> 12:12.493
What? What?

12:14.465 --> 12:15.665
What?

12:15.824 --> 12:17.624
Kaz reckons you shopped us.

12:17.630 --> 12:21.607
Okay. I don't give a fuck about
what she thinks, what do you think?

12:21.613 --> 12:22.857
I dunno.

12:23.293 --> 12:26.501
- But if you didn't, who did?
- Well, I've got no idea.

12:27.387 --> 12:29.720
- Anyway, it doesn't matter to me...
- Oh, no, hang on.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.051
I don't know anything about it, okay?

12:32.057 --> 12:33.284
Okay.

12:33.289 --> 12:34.956
No, you don't believe me.

12:35.118 --> 12:37.087
Bea, it doesn't matter to me.

12:37.093 --> 12:38.626
Well, it matters to me.

12:39.015 --> 12:40.350
I didn't do it.

12:40.955 --> 12:43.704
Okay. Fine.

12:50.098 --> 12:51.298
Hey.

12:53.043 --> 12:54.737
Same time tomorrow?

12:56.717 --> 12:59.324
- Come on.
- I'll think about it.

13:01.275 --> 13:03.022
You're so gonna be here.

13:03.558 --> 13:06.731
You'll see I've made a
couple of small edits.

13:06.737 --> 13:09.200
Some of your comments about Ferguson,

13:09.206 --> 13:12.369
I mean, they were
technically speculation, so...

13:12.373 --> 13:15.076
It's still a very clear
and strong statement.

13:15.083 --> 13:17.553
It is 100% certain that...

13:18.007 --> 13:21.233
that once I'm identified as a
witness, she goes back into protection?

13:21.239 --> 13:23.571
As requested. It's in writing.

13:31.095 --> 13:33.394
I need you to do something else for me.

13:35.002 --> 13:36.202
But what?

13:36.208 --> 13:38.141
I need you to track
down some information.

13:38.147 --> 13:40.588
You can't keep cutting deals.

13:40.594 --> 13:42.211
That's how it tends to work around here.

13:42.217 --> 13:43.531
Look, look, look, I'm sorry.

13:43.537 --> 13:46.549
I really can not facilitate
your requests like this.

13:51.185 --> 13:53.891
Okay. Fine.

13:55.252 --> 13:56.455
Ah, yeah...

13:58.575 --> 14:00.674
just tell me it's not a helicopter.

14:01.603 --> 14:03.291
Any light-headedness?

14:04.439 --> 14:07.035
Not currently. No, it
seems to come and go.

14:13.846 --> 14:15.046
_

15:22.222 --> 15:23.611
One, two, three...

15:23.617 --> 15:25.087
One, two... one, two three...

15:25.092 --> 15:26.359
One, two, three.

15:26.365 --> 15:27.565
One, two, three.

15:27.571 --> 15:30.411
one, two... one, two, three...

15:50.725 --> 15:52.655
_

16:02.198 --> 16:04.410
Attention compound. Attention compound.

16:04.416 --> 16:06.349
Prisoners may now leave their units.

16:06.355 --> 16:08.295
Oh, here. I've been stockpilin'.

16:10.025 --> 16:13.128
- Booms, they do feed you in hospital.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:13.134 --> 16:15.080
You can have treats, though.
I checked with Nurse Ratshit.

16:15.085 --> 16:17.135
I even got Monte Carlos, yep, four.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.109
- Best wishes Maxine.
- Fuck off.

16:19.115 --> 16:21.113
Just wanted to convey my best wishes.

16:21.119 --> 16:22.396
Now, fuck off.

16:22.402 --> 16:26.856
- Hey, Booms, you been approved yet?
- I will be. Fuck off!

16:27.034 --> 16:29.826
Oh, I see.

16:29.832 --> 16:33.850
I haven't heard back yet, but it is
gonna happen, all right! So, fuck off!

16:33.856 --> 16:35.500
Come on, Booms. Ignore her.

16:35.506 --> 16:37.510
I wouldn't be terribly
optimistic I'm afraid.

16:37.516 --> 16:39.961
It takes a certain amount of backbone
to negotiate with Mr. Channing.

16:39.966 --> 16:41.640
It's fine Booms, ignore her.

16:41.646 --> 16:44.647
I'm not so sure that Governor
Bennett is up to the task.

16:45.773 --> 16:48.134
Hope I'm wrong. Sincerely.

16:48.140 --> 16:50.273
Just let it go, Booms, let it go.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.477
Yep.

16:53.977 --> 16:55.177
Fuck off!

17:00.002 --> 17:01.202
Hey!

17:03.179 --> 17:05.998
Maxine Conway is departing
for treatment. It's confirmed.

17:06.003 --> 17:08.608
If I can get Jenkins out of the
picture, it'll happen after lunch.

17:09.993 --> 17:11.724
- Today?
- Mm.

17:12.373 --> 17:15.193
Bea Smith'll be dead by... 3pm.

17:18.685 --> 17:20.005
What's the matter?

17:21.986 --> 17:25.498
Think now is perhaps not the best time
to be having a crisis of conscience.

17:32.897 --> 17:34.424
I can't kill a woman.

17:34.429 --> 17:36.891
You're not. You won't
be anywhere near it.

17:36.896 --> 17:38.915
You're just creating a
distraction, that's all.

17:42.279 --> 17:46.853
One day, it will come
down to just you and her.

17:46.859 --> 17:49.885
And one of you will
die. It's inevitable.

17:52.451 --> 17:54.697
What we're doing is just
making sure it's not you.

18:05.848 --> 18:07.230
What do you need?

18:09.977 --> 18:13.071
Uh, sorry, I have a migraine coming on!

18:13.350 --> 18:15.168
Ah, Bridget Westfall.

18:15.545 --> 18:16.884
Ah.

18:20.128 --> 18:22.731
- Come in. Come in.
- Thank you.

18:24.557 --> 18:25.836
Sit, please.

18:25.920 --> 18:27.748
Excuse the smell. I don't know if it's

18:27.754 --> 18:30.498
urine or wet towels but I
can't seem to get rid of it.

18:30.504 --> 18:32.357
And they confiscated my perfume.

18:32.363 --> 18:34.162
Oh yes, the alcohol in it.

18:34.168 --> 18:35.629
Oh, I'm hardly gonna drink it.

18:35.635 --> 18:36.835
No, not you.

18:37.121 --> 18:40.654
Now I'm just checking in
to see how you're settling.

18:41.026 --> 18:42.950
Well, look at me, I'm a wreck.

18:43.264 --> 18:46.131
Actually I think you...
you seem, quite composed.

18:46.136 --> 18:47.953
- Oh, please.
- No, no, really.

18:47.959 --> 18:50.266
A lot of prisoners find it
very difficult to adjust.

18:50.272 --> 18:52.851
Well, I'm not planning on adjusting.
I'm not planning on being here long.

18:52.856 --> 18:54.234
I have a company to run.

18:54.240 --> 18:57.880
That might be a
tad difficult from in here.

19:00.994 --> 19:03.353
There are two kinds of
women in this world, Bridget.

19:03.358 --> 19:05.204
- Mmm?
- There are the hammers...

19:05.210 --> 19:06.819
and there are the anvils.

19:07.014 --> 19:10.236
I have never seen myself as an anvil.

19:10.428 --> 19:12.851
I'd bear in mind that
you might be spending

19:12.857 --> 19:14.691
quite a lot of time with these women.

19:14.697 --> 19:18.731
Hopefully not, but it,
uh... it is a possibility.

19:20.275 --> 19:21.475
Fuck.

19:23.283 --> 19:24.918
Well...

19:25.298 --> 19:26.854
I like Liz.

19:27.189 --> 19:30.669
She's personable, like a sort of

19:31.207 --> 19:33.975
nice tea lady you might
stop and have a chat with.

19:33.981 --> 19:35.181
Yeah.

19:35.187 --> 19:37.472
She's probably my best
friend in here, I think.

19:37.792 --> 19:38.999
God.

19:39.621 --> 19:41.482
Sad statement, isn't it.

19:42.192 --> 19:43.832
Governor says you're going well.

19:44.331 --> 19:45.824
- Really?
- Mmm.

19:45.830 --> 19:47.987
Says Sonia's really latched onto you.

19:47.993 --> 19:51.495
Um, oh well, she sticks close
to me but I think that's just

19:51.501 --> 19:54.516
because I'm a bit less scary
than some of the other women.

19:55.738 --> 19:57.515
Oh, she said something
about her husband.

19:57.521 --> 19:59.089
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

19:59.095 --> 20:01.502
It wasn't much but she
said he disappeared.

20:01.508 --> 20:04.297
Right, he got cancer
and then he disappeared.

20:04.303 --> 20:06.449
- Right.
- Yeah, she didn't go into any detail.

20:06.454 --> 20:07.711
Did she mention that, er,

20:07.717 --> 20:10.399
it was a murder investigation and
that she was one of the suspects?

20:10.405 --> 20:12.523
- Nah.
- We suspect her involvement.

20:12.597 --> 20:15.315
There was no cancer
diagnosis ever recorded.

20:15.321 --> 20:17.083
- It was just Sonia's testimony.
- Oh.

20:17.089 --> 20:18.625
And no body was ever found.

20:18.631 --> 20:20.862
And then she got off
because her friend Helen,

20:20.868 --> 20:22.456
provided her with a false alibi.

20:22.584 --> 20:23.848
Helen, who's missing?

20:23.854 --> 20:27.758
We suspect, that over time Sonia got
paranoid that Helen might confess, so...

20:27.764 --> 20:30.303
- So she had to get rid of her too.
- Mm-hm.

20:31.217 --> 20:32.417
Wow.

20:34.013 --> 20:36.565
- Serial killer?
- Mmm.

20:38.388 --> 20:40.144
I hope this isn't too unnerving for you,

20:40.150 --> 20:42.019
I'd hate to undermine
your progress here.

20:43.147 --> 20:46.252
No. No. No, it's... it's all good, yeah.

20:46.468 --> 20:47.679
No, Sonia's...

20:47.685 --> 20:51.172
she's fine. Like, you know, she's a
bit sniffy and she comes across stuck up

20:51.178 --> 20:52.607
but once you get to know her...

20:52.613 --> 20:55.033
- she's actually great. Yeah.
- Mmm.

20:57.740 --> 20:59.967
What's your cover story
for these meetings?

21:01.351 --> 21:03.778
"Oh, I've just seen the prison psych,

21:03.784 --> 21:06.674
"and she's got a new rehab
program, but don't get me started

21:06.680 --> 21:10.720
"'cause she yabbers on and on about my
deep anxiety, and my low self-esteem.

21:10.726 --> 21:13.808
"Oh God, she's such a bore,
she's got to get out more."

21:13.814 --> 21:15.527
- That is excellent.
- Yeah.

21:24.856 --> 21:27.198
Mate, should have cooled off
before gettin' in the shower,

21:27.204 --> 21:28.404
I'm still sweatin'.

21:28.410 --> 21:31.278
Mate, you do realise the women
use the staff room too, eh?

21:31.283 --> 21:33.005
Yeah, I know that.

21:33.154 --> 21:34.727
There's no one here except you and me.

21:36.209 --> 21:37.409
Mm.

21:38.302 --> 21:39.502
So...

21:40.756 --> 21:43.016
Governor Bennett.
What's the dealio there?

21:43.335 --> 21:44.676
The dealio?

21:44.890 --> 21:46.518
Yeah. She single?

21:46.656 --> 21:47.994
Married to the job.

21:48.694 --> 21:51.500
- She like guys or girls?
- Men, as far as I'm aware.

21:52.170 --> 21:53.370
You sure?

21:53.468 --> 21:55.794
She, ah, had a thing with an officer...

21:56.327 --> 21:57.646
male officer.

21:57.944 --> 21:59.261
She seems...

21:59.647 --> 22:01.826
I dunno, a bit sort of
stitched up for all that.

22:02.514 --> 22:04.691
Mate, she's the governor,
show some respect, eh?

22:04.697 --> 22:06.940
Yeah, no, I mean no
disrespect of course.

22:07.228 --> 22:08.480
I'm just...

22:08.728 --> 22:10.030
intrigued.

22:11.574 --> 22:12.914
Put some pants on, eh?

22:13.119 --> 22:14.319
Yes, Mum.

22:18.686 --> 22:19.886
Hey.

22:23.454 --> 22:24.654
You ready, Conway?

22:27.850 --> 22:30.811
Ah, unfortunately, Jenkins,
your application wasn't approved.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.017
I'm so sorry.

22:32.787 --> 22:33.987
Oh, fuck.

22:34.796 --> 22:37.369
The security concerns were too great.

22:37.496 --> 22:41.313
I know this is disappointing.
I am, really sorry.

22:41.976 --> 22:43.378
I am really sorry.

22:46.405 --> 22:47.605
Yeah.

22:50.322 --> 22:52.073
- Here y'are. No,
- Oh, no, Booms. They're your biscuits.

22:52.078 --> 22:53.097
- take 'em.
- Honey, I don't need them.

22:53.103 --> 22:54.346
- Take them.
- I don't need them.

22:54.351 --> 22:56.683
I love you. I love you,
Maxie, all right. I...

22:57.296 --> 22:59.396
- I love you.
- Oh, honey.

23:00.705 --> 23:02.961
- Hey, Booms, Booms. Hey.
- Yeah.

23:02.967 --> 23:05.681
- Call me, okay. And you remember...
- Yeah.

23:05.688 --> 23:07.984
remember what I said,
okay, "tough and brave".

23:07.990 --> 23:10.104
Tough and brave, yeah.

23:12.240 --> 23:13.647
She'll be right.

23:13.717 --> 23:15.272
Okay, hon, I've gotta go.

23:15.871 --> 23:18.089
Okay. Okay.

23:19.653 --> 23:21.800
Well, good luck, my darlin'.

23:25.186 --> 23:26.386
Oh!

23:27.314 --> 23:28.514
Oh.

23:29.340 --> 23:31.216
Thank you. Thanks, Sonia.

23:38.021 --> 23:39.396
You're doin' the right thing.

23:40.967 --> 23:43.670
Now, darling. You go for it!

23:44.418 --> 23:47.465
Am I allowed to carry Maxie's
bag, is that approved of?

23:47.471 --> 23:48.750
Of course, Jenkins.

23:50.751 --> 23:52.118
Maxine! Oh...

23:52.124 --> 23:53.463
Oh, Dors!

23:54.095 --> 23:55.942
Thought you forgot about me.

23:56.040 --> 23:57.618
You stay strong, okay.

23:57.805 --> 23:59.274
Thanks, Dors.

24:01.595 --> 24:02.795
Bag.

24:02.801 --> 24:04.607
There you go, there you go.

24:04.832 --> 24:06.039
Yep.

24:18.405 --> 24:21.170
- Bye, love!
- We love you, Maxine!

24:21.176 --> 24:23.136
- Bye!
- I just...

24:23.142 --> 24:25.694
- Oh, love. Oh, darlin'.
- Oh, my God.

24:25.700 --> 24:27.490
Come on. It's all right.

24:27.809 --> 24:29.014
Do you want a cuppa tea?

24:29.238 --> 24:31.075
I fucked up!

24:34.785 --> 24:36.718
I really am sorry, Booms.

24:37.457 --> 24:40.240
Did the Governor blame
it on security concerns?

24:40.246 --> 24:42.197
- Yeah, yeah.
- Jeez, pathetic!

24:42.414 --> 24:45.748
Channing would never have said
that. Doubt she even asked him.

24:45.961 --> 24:48.058
- What?
- Takes real strength

24:48.064 --> 24:49.981
to make a case to the regional director.

24:49.987 --> 24:52.772
But she'd rather abandon
Maxine, than do that.

24:57.229 --> 24:59.827
You're weak as piss, Vinegar Tits!

25:00.179 --> 25:01.689
Weak as piss!

25:03.688 --> 25:04.888
Slot her.

25:06.765 --> 25:08.116
Okay, Jenkins...

25:08.122 --> 25:09.802
No, no.

25:09.808 --> 25:11.496
- Come on.
- Fuck off! I should...

25:11.501 --> 25:13.625
She didn't even ask!

25:13.823 --> 25:16.554
- She didn't even ask!
- All right, all right.

25:17.203 --> 25:20.058
I've got to ask... "Vinegar Tits"?

25:21.289 --> 25:23.796
It's just a stupid
nickname. We all get names.

25:23.968 --> 25:26.035
But Linda's is "Smiles".

25:27.265 --> 25:30.393
It just seems so... you know, at odds...

25:30.843 --> 25:32.043
with you.

25:37.009 --> 25:38.306
Hey, love.

25:41.439 --> 25:42.710
Ridiculous.

25:43.788 --> 25:45.360
I barely know Maxine.

25:48.787 --> 25:51.706
Do you want a biscuit?
Got plenty of Monte Carlos.

25:57.717 --> 26:00.364
Must be bloody awful,
not knowin' what happened.

26:01.788 --> 26:03.120
With your husband.

26:04.936 --> 26:08.419
Oh... sorry, love. You... you
don't have to talk about it.

26:08.424 --> 26:12.188
You know the day he told me, he
was just so matter of fact about it.

26:13.354 --> 26:14.663
Oh, God.

26:14.760 --> 26:16.610
Mm, I fell to pieces, of course.

26:16.616 --> 26:19.775
But then he kept saying,
"Let's not get hysterical".

26:19.781 --> 26:21.584
Of course you did, love.

26:24.826 --> 26:26.026
And then...

26:26.389 --> 26:28.430
in the early hours of the morning...

26:29.452 --> 26:32.123
I took some sleeping pills,
we both did. I thought we just

26:32.129 --> 26:33.899
needed to lose consciousness.

26:33.905 --> 26:35.253
And I woke up...

26:35.796 --> 26:37.025
at dawn...

26:38.118 --> 26:40.631
and the bed was empty. He was gone.

26:42.128 --> 26:44.526
- And that was it.
- Jesus!

26:49.859 --> 26:52.386
You know in my worst moments, I think...

26:53.351 --> 26:55.401
was it even true?

26:56.116 --> 26:59.667
Mm, did he just want to end the
marriage? Was it just some...

27:00.952 --> 27:03.289
elaborate plan to get rid of me?

27:04.300 --> 27:06.409
Oh, God, I'm sure it wasn't.

27:07.690 --> 27:09.346
And then, of course, I feel this...

27:09.761 --> 27:12.291
hideous guilt for even considering that.

27:25.055 --> 27:26.959
Bea, you called for this session,

27:27.890 --> 27:29.636
- perhaps you'd like to start...
- You're...

27:30.363 --> 27:32.729
you have relationships
with women, right?

27:32.734 --> 27:35.216
- I think you know that answer to that.
- Have you always...

27:35.703 --> 27:36.903
with women?

27:36.909 --> 27:39.627
No. In my 20's I...

27:39.633 --> 27:42.273
I did date men.

27:42.279 --> 27:43.657
Do you call yourself...

27:45.044 --> 27:46.277
bi or whatever?

27:46.333 --> 27:48.595
Well, it doesn't matter
what I call myself.

27:48.934 --> 27:52.940
But I will say this, I think, uh,
a lot of women who identify

27:52.946 --> 27:57.482
as lesbian, have had relationships
with men, at some point.

28:01.041 --> 28:02.327
What about...

28:02.955 --> 28:04.249
"gate gay"...

28:04.501 --> 28:07.314
- do you think it's real?
- What do you mean real?

28:09.196 --> 28:10.401
Bea, we've not

28:10.407 --> 28:13.390
discussed your perspectives
on love and relationships...

28:14.241 --> 28:15.968
you know, looking into the future,

28:16.387 --> 28:18.884
it's actually conceivable that, um...

28:21.356 --> 28:22.556
Bea?

28:27.323 --> 28:28.656
Where are you going?

28:30.871 --> 28:32.234
I think I'm done here.

28:32.465 --> 28:35.719
You know, I have, I've
known a lot of women

28:35.997 --> 28:41.704
who identified as, ah, straight and who
fell in love with a woman and panicked.

28:41.710 --> 28:45.879
And to those women, I always
said "Forget the terminology.

28:46.070 --> 28:48.416
"Just be in the moment
and see how you feel."

28:48.904 --> 28:50.841
'Cause if you've fallen for
someone then...

28:51.842 --> 28:53.264
fuck the labels.

29:04.874 --> 29:08.435
She's just gotta stop
bein' such a bloody hothead.

29:09.051 --> 29:11.643
She can't even ring Maxine now.

29:11.745 --> 29:13.063
Bloody idiot.

29:13.069 --> 29:16.122
Every time I ask him in he
keeps makin' these excuses.

29:16.128 --> 29:19.200
Just cried herself to sleep. Poor thing.

29:20.304 --> 29:22.702
I think sometimes you
have to tell the truth.

29:24.503 --> 29:27.727
How could you do that? She
was just too hysterical.

29:29.971 --> 29:32.072
...stupid system of punishing...

30:00.756 --> 30:02.758
Nuh, we have to pay for 'em.

30:03.087 --> 30:04.298
No, it's concealed...

30:04.304 --> 30:05.935
...it's a really big backyard.

30:07.280 --> 30:11.432
It is. Anyways... and Nash says
she's really good with the kids.

30:11.438 --> 30:15.675
And of course my mind's racing and...
and Nash will obviously see that.

30:15.681 --> 30:16.884
Just give us a sec.

30:18.923 --> 30:21.089
Well, see you just gave
up on Maxine, did you?

30:22.532 --> 30:23.874
Not worth the effort?

30:24.713 --> 30:26.361
- What?
- Don't listen to her, love.

30:26.367 --> 30:28.179
You let a woman leave this prison

30:28.185 --> 30:31.142
for a double mastectomy
with no fuckin' support!

30:31.344 --> 30:32.544
What kind of leader are you?

30:32.675 --> 30:34.277
Why don't you just go back and sit down?

30:34.282 --> 30:35.568
Or maybe it was deliberate.

30:35.830 --> 30:39.193
Everyone here would rather have
Maxine as Top Dog, we all know that.

30:40.033 --> 30:41.788
Maybe you'd be happier if she was dead.

30:41.794 --> 30:43.505
- Will you fuck off!
- Bea, Bea, Bea!

30:43.511 --> 30:44.711
Hey, hey!

30:46.220 --> 30:48.510
Fuck you, bitch!

30:48.516 --> 30:51.357
All right! Calm down!

30:52.539 --> 30:54.066
Settle down, Smith!

30:54.072 --> 30:55.338
- You let her go!
- Cunt!

30:55.343 --> 30:56.723
- That's enough!
- Come on then!

30:56.728 --> 30:58.800
- Back off, Proctor!
- Yeah, fuckin' protect her

30:58.806 --> 31:00.397
why don't you, you screw lover.

31:00.403 --> 31:01.930
Oh yeah, heard that one before.

31:01.936 --> 31:04.345
Sit down, Smith. Sit down!

31:07.673 --> 31:09.039
Sit down, ladies.

31:15.445 --> 31:16.660
What was that?

31:16.895 --> 31:20.432
Just making a point. About Maxine.

31:21.864 --> 31:24.440
Bea, she's not worth it, love.

31:24.446 --> 31:26.054
Yeah, but she's asking for it.

31:26.207 --> 31:29.324
Look love, I don't want to
tell you what to do but please,

31:29.330 --> 31:31.440
don't end up in the slot like Boomer.

31:31.756 --> 31:35.794
Then I'd be in charge, and
then we'd be really fucked.

31:36.479 --> 31:37.679
Wouldn't we?

31:41.034 --> 31:43.876
- Come on, let's go.
- Bloody hell.

32:31.960 --> 32:35.944
That Kaz woman. Personally, I can't
see why anyone would follow her.

32:35.949 --> 32:38.483
Seems completely deranged to me.

32:39.678 --> 32:41.794
Perhaps in private she's more engaging.

32:41.800 --> 32:45.311
Hey, uh, I just gotta
check on something, okay?

32:47.949 --> 32:49.563
You gonna be all right?

32:50.433 --> 32:51.831
I suppose.

32:59.365 --> 33:01.031
Allie. Come with us, now.

33:02.214 --> 33:03.489
Why? What's going on.

33:03.495 --> 33:04.889
Put that down. Come with us.

33:04.895 --> 33:07.437
We're making a stand for Maxine.
All of us united. Come on.

33:07.715 --> 33:09.515
Come on. Hurry up!

33:28.218 --> 33:29.851
Hey, leave that, come with us.

33:29.857 --> 33:31.491
- What?
- We're all making a stand.

33:31.497 --> 33:34.073
Protesting for Maxine having to
go through her operation alone.

33:34.079 --> 33:35.459
Uh, I don't think so, love.

33:35.465 --> 33:36.961
It's not about crews or anything.

33:36.966 --> 33:38.187
It's for Maxine.

33:38.193 --> 33:39.589
No, I've gotta ring Soph.

33:39.595 --> 33:43.404
And quite frankly, I don't like
the way Kaz is using Maxine, love.

34:00.244 --> 34:02.391
Sierra 5, this is Sierra 2.

34:02.397 --> 34:03.661
Come in Sierra 2.

34:03.667 --> 34:06.914
Proctor's on the warpath again. There's
a posse of women heading your way.

34:07.392 --> 34:09.574
Oh, copy that. I'm seeing it now.

34:10.120 --> 34:11.815
_

34:32.855 --> 34:34.210
Allie?

34:38.605 --> 34:39.804
Allie?

34:44.324 --> 34:46.782
Hey, I'm in here!

34:46.788 --> 34:48.456
Hey, I'm in here!

34:52.617 --> 34:54.859
Allie...

34:54.864 --> 34:56.773
- All right, Proctor.
- We're here in unity.

34:56.779 --> 34:59.489
Maxine Conway, already
a victim of abuse,

34:59.495 --> 35:04.165
was today sent away for a
double mastectomy, alone.

35:04.171 --> 35:05.371
Okay.

35:05.625 --> 35:07.359
Help!

35:07.365 --> 35:10.263
Hey! I'm in here!

35:11.805 --> 35:13.005
Shit.

35:14.354 --> 35:16.276
Come on!

35:16.635 --> 35:18.016
Help!

35:20.471 --> 35:22.240
Hey!

35:23.217 --> 35:26.476
It's just another example
of the inhumane treatment

35:26.482 --> 35:28.870
- of the women.
- Yeah! It sucks!

35:36.064 --> 35:37.957
Look we've got a lot of women
here waiting patiently for...

35:37.962 --> 35:42.031
If you wanna support Maxine,
sit with us, demand respect.

35:42.204 --> 35:44.193
Whatcha gonna do about it, Stewie?

35:47.276 --> 35:48.950
Hey!

35:52.978 --> 35:54.404
Oh.

35:54.713 --> 35:58.761
Well, Mr. Stewart. It looks
like we're all in agreement.

36:06.759 --> 36:07.959
Ah!

36:09.072 --> 36:12.354
Help!

36:12.360 --> 36:15.936
Help!

36:19.249 --> 36:20.633
Maxine's hardly alone.

36:20.639 --> 36:23.419
She's got the support of a nurse.
She's got the support of an officer.

36:23.425 --> 36:25.539
Yeah, real comfort that is.

36:26.368 --> 36:27.696
He's not getting anywhere.

36:27.701 --> 36:29.850
She's stopping the women
from taking their medication.

36:29.856 --> 36:32.039
That's more than enough
justification for the slot.

36:32.045 --> 36:34.201
- No, you wait here.
- Look, if we break this up as...

36:34.207 --> 36:37.015
I would rather not inflame
things between you and Proctor.

36:37.021 --> 36:38.929
Sierra 5, this is Sierra 2.

36:38.935 --> 36:40.156
- Come in Sierra 2.
- It's not right.

36:40.161 --> 36:41.428
I'm on my way down.

36:41.434 --> 36:43.851
- Ooh, freakin' Vinegar Tits!
- Oooh!

36:43.857 --> 36:45.057
Here we go!

36:47.264 --> 36:48.467
No!

37:09.348 --> 37:13.095
- Argh!
- No, come on. Don't, don't, don't.

37:14.174 --> 37:15.374
It's pointless.

37:16.922 --> 37:20.814
You can't overpower me, your system is
flooding with a heavy dose of Rohypnol.

37:22.735 --> 37:23.935
No.

37:24.166 --> 37:27.479
It's not a poison. It
won't cause you pain.

37:28.691 --> 37:30.293
It's a sedative.

37:31.647 --> 37:33.761
It's a very potent sedative.

37:35.418 --> 37:40.833
You imbibed it, oh, about
half an hour ago now.

37:40.839 --> 37:46.569
So, this is in solidarity
with Conway, is it, Proctor?

37:46.989 --> 37:48.284
Absolutely!

37:48.826 --> 37:53.023
You can't speak, can you? The muscles
around your throat and your jaw,

37:53.029 --> 37:55.868
in fact, all your muscles
will be heavily affected now.

37:56.141 --> 37:59.450
Maxine Conway, who right
now would be being prepped

37:59.456 --> 38:01.721
- for a double mastectomy...
- Mmm.

38:01.727 --> 38:03.984
- totally alone.
- Mmm.

38:04.331 --> 38:07.041
Your central nervous
system will be slowing.

38:07.047 --> 38:08.724
Your heart rate falling.

38:08.730 --> 38:10.909
So, to support Conway...

38:11.042 --> 38:14.249
you're disrupting other women's
access to their medication?

38:15.120 --> 38:18.143
You know, Bea, if you stop fighting me,

38:18.414 --> 38:22.905
then all the tension and anxiety just

38:22.911 --> 38:24.568
ebbs away.

38:28.271 --> 38:29.615
Unbelievable.

38:31.532 --> 38:36.670
You begin to feel a...
a magnificent calm.

38:38.619 --> 38:41.203
Shhh.

38:46.722 --> 38:49.122
That's it. Just let yourself succumb.

38:56.584 --> 38:58.496
This should only take a minute or two.

38:58.501 --> 39:00.680
Right, ah, sorry the
Governor's occupied...

39:00.686 --> 39:03.763
I really just need to get Bea
Smith's signature on her statement.

39:03.769 --> 39:06.302
And, ah, I have something she was after.

39:19.758 --> 39:20.958
Ah!

39:22.260 --> 39:25.228
You must be so afraid.
You're still struggling.

39:27.047 --> 39:29.009
Governor, if you leave
it much longer the

39:29.015 --> 39:31.069
Methadone girls are
gonna start flippin' out.

39:32.467 --> 39:35.750
There are only two ways
to die in prison, Bea:

39:36.937 --> 39:39.222
you could fall victim to an attack,

39:39.228 --> 39:41.333
be left to bleed in some...

39:42.538 --> 39:44.186
filthy corner;

39:45.323 --> 39:46.926
or far worse...

39:47.680 --> 39:49.644
you could grow old.

39:50.635 --> 39:52.980
We'll call the women needing
medication up to the desk,

39:52.986 --> 39:54.518
- one by one.
- Well I don't think you should

39:54.523 --> 39:56.784
- be working around her.
- Okay, where are we up to

39:56.789 --> 39:58.067
- on the medical list?
- "L".

40:00.978 --> 40:03.627
Sit and watch everyone you love,

40:03.633 --> 40:06.143
Liz and Maxine and...

40:07.094 --> 40:08.955
even young Allie,

40:09.565 --> 40:12.060
watching them all leave you one by one.

40:12.754 --> 40:15.616
I just need one minute with Bea Smith.

40:15.622 --> 40:17.582
Well, if you'd like to
leave the paperwork, I'm...

40:17.588 --> 40:18.968
I can't just leave it.

40:18.974 --> 40:20.614
You delude yourself that...

40:21.067 --> 40:23.334
the relationships might endure, but...

40:23.933 --> 40:26.526
you become a tiresome
obligation to them,

40:27.823 --> 40:29.662
and then a painful memory.

40:30.742 --> 40:32.485
Then, nothing at all.

40:32.491 --> 40:35.719
She asked me to source
something, a call recording.

40:35.725 --> 40:37.333
- What's the call?
- It's the call that put

40:37.338 --> 40:38.823
Karen Proctor away.

40:39.139 --> 40:42.450
And then, after a painful
eternity, you would...

40:42.809 --> 40:45.478
fall prey to cancer, or...

40:45.721 --> 40:47.225
heart disease perhaps?

40:47.231 --> 40:48.605
And then...

40:49.830 --> 40:52.547
You would die an old wretch.

40:53.519 --> 40:54.976
Yes, Western Crimes Division.

40:54.981 --> 40:56.581
I'm calling to report a crime.

40:56.586 --> 40:58.450
- Who am I talking to?
- I'm an inmate,

40:58.455 --> 41:01.236
at Wentworth Prison. I-I have
some relevant information.

41:01.242 --> 41:03.114
Your legacy forgotten.

41:04.143 --> 41:08.424
Just, vomiting yourself
to death in a barren cell.

41:11.066 --> 41:13.347
This group, the Red Right Hand...

41:13.360 --> 41:15.788
I'm calling to report the
identity of their leader.

41:15.793 --> 41:18.413
It's a... it's a woman
called Karen Proctor.

41:19.693 --> 41:22.378
I have so much more respect for you now.

41:22.790 --> 41:24.456
- Can I borrow this?
- Karen...

41:24.462 --> 41:26.882
- What are you doing?
- Look just... just stay right here.

41:27.579 --> 41:29.494
I hope that you can see this...

41:29.675 --> 41:31.111
this peaceful,

41:31.395 --> 41:35.209
silent passing as a...
as a victory for you.

41:35.417 --> 41:37.493
But she's already doing that, so...

41:38.518 --> 41:41.440
Have you been let out of
the playpen, Mr. Jackson?

41:43.364 --> 41:44.564
Ladies, listen...

41:48.550 --> 41:50.114
This is my gift.

41:52.248 --> 41:54.292
Would you like to hear
the call that put you away?

42:40.678 --> 42:42.638
You're a fucking bitch!

42:42.644 --> 42:45.361
Lying traitor! Liar!

42:45.367 --> 42:46.671
Fuck! No!

42:46.977 --> 42:48.254
Push the panic button!

42:48.462 --> 42:50.237
Push the panic button!

42:50.242 --> 42:52.105
No! Help! Help!

42:52.111 --> 42:53.816
It's fucking jail!

42:55.109 --> 42:56.309
Fuck!

42:59.437 --> 43:00.882
Oof! Ugh!

43:00.888 --> 43:02.593
- You shopped us!
- Aww!

43:02.599 --> 43:03.799
Bea!

43:03.805 --> 43:05.729
Fuck, she's not breathing!

43:05.735 --> 43:07.724
Someone call for help!

43:07.730 --> 43:09.672
You shopped us all!

43:09.678 --> 43:10.878
- Ugh!
- Argh!

43:10.884 --> 43:14.781
You fucking... psychotic... bitch!

43:14.787 --> 43:16.116
No, no! I...

43:16.117 --> 43:18.688
I don't know what to do! I
don't know what I'm doing!

43:18.694 --> 43:19.895
Fuck!

43:19.900 --> 43:22.704
No, no. I didn't do
it! I didn't... argh!

43:26.993 --> 43:28.933
Somebody help!

43:28.939 --> 43:30.393
She's not breathing.

43:31.998 --> 43:34.274
- Argh, argh!
- Oi, Proctor!

43:34.936 --> 43:37.170
- Hey, settle!
- Fuck off!

43:37.176 --> 43:38.380
Calm down, Proctor

43:38.386 --> 43:39.962
Go, go, go, go,
go! There. Allie, get her up.

43:39.967 --> 43:41.741
- Come on, come on.
- Just help us, please.

43:41.746 --> 43:43.218
- She's not breathing.
- Bea, can you hear me?

43:43.223 --> 43:44.424
Bea, can you...?

44:04.332 --> 44:06.652
_

44:06.658 --> 44:09.878
If you can remember
something, anything, that's it.

44:09.884 --> 44:11.375
- Liar!
- Argh!

44:14.880 --> 44:19.108
I think Joan Ferguson was trying to
kill Bea Smith, and I think you knew.

44:19.864 --> 44:22.832
There's a rumour going around
that we were trying to murder Bea.

44:25.386 --> 44:26.593
Don't!

44:26.599 --> 44:28.800
You're supposed to be my friend!

44:28.806 --> 44:30.736
I am the only one!

44:31.347 --> 44:32.923
It's all over.

44:33.035 --> 44:34.235
It's fate...

44:34.241 --> 44:36.147
What a limited imagination you have.

44:37.147 --> 44:39.467
_

44:39.474 --> 44:42.622
Ferguson is still making plans,
okay. She's meeting contacts.

44:42.669 --> 44:44.925
You must be proud of
yourself, engineering this.

44:44.974 --> 44:47.272
Outsmarting you would
be a rather insignificant

44:47.278 --> 44:48.529
achievement, don't you think?

44:48.535 --> 44:50.089
Don't let her get in your head.

44:53.759 --> 44:54.959
You got a visitor.

44:56.105 --> 44:59.154
- _
- The new season of Wentworth.

44:59.160 --> 45:02.693
- _
- 08:30 next Tuesday, on SoHo.
