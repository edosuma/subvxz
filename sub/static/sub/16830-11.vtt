_

01:42.677 --> 01:44.558
_

01:44.583 --> 01:47.632
Wallace, is that yours?

01:51.944 --> 01:55.173
_

01:55.869 --> 01:58.678
_

02:05.885 --> 02:08.519
- Hayes, thanks for coming down.
- I was hoping for brunch,

02:08.622 --> 02:11.021
but an active crime scene
is a close second.

02:11.124 --> 02:12.557
Missed you this morning.

02:12.659 --> 02:15.593
Believe me, I'd rather
still be in bed with you.

02:15.695 --> 02:18.039
- Remember the Black Orchid Killer?
- Serial killer... yeah.

02:18.064 --> 02:19.897
It was national news.
Terrified the city.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.866
It was like Summer of Sam
all over again.

02:21.968 --> 02:23.601
And for a damn good reason.

02:23.703 --> 02:25.336
All three female victims

02:25.438 --> 02:27.138
brutally beaten to death in their homes.

02:27.240 --> 02:28.840
Killer became known as B.O.K.

02:28.942 --> 02:31.442
'cause he liked to smear lipstick
on their faces afterwards,

02:31.544 --> 02:33.678
specifically Black Orchid #4.

02:33.780 --> 02:35.947
Hayes Morrison, Detective Nick Cestero.

02:36.049 --> 02:38.283
He worked the original case back in '06.

02:38.385 --> 02:39.584
Helped put the guy away.

02:39.686 --> 02:41.185
Clark Sims will be spending

02:41.288 --> 02:43.121
the rest of his days in Dannemora.

02:43.223 --> 02:44.088
Or maybe not.

02:44.190 --> 02:45.390
If D.A. Wallace asked me here,

02:45.492 --> 02:47.692
I'm guessing that you think that
B.O.K. is back at it.

02:47.794 --> 02:50.161
Marla Higgins, 38, schoolteacher.

02:50.263 --> 02:52.196
Died last night
from apparent bludgeoning.

02:52.299 --> 02:55.199
Dark hair, blue eyes just like
all the other B.O.K. victims,

02:55.302 --> 02:57.835
and wearing the distinctive
shade of lipstick...

02:57.937 --> 03:00.138
Not that we'll be sharing
that detail with the media.

03:00.240 --> 03:03.341
Whoever killed Marla Higgins,
it wasn't Clark Sims.

03:03.443 --> 03:04.642
Probably a copycat.

03:04.744 --> 03:06.044
Or maybe you put the wrong guy
away in the first place.

03:06.146 --> 03:08.980
Look, you'll each get to work
your own angle.

03:09.082 --> 03:10.982
CIU will look at Clark Sims' conviction

03:11.084 --> 03:13.451
while the NYPD goes after
whoever killed Marla Higgins,

03:13.553 --> 03:15.186
whether that's the original B.O.K...

03:15.322 --> 03:16.621
- It's not.
- ...or a copycat.

03:17.624 --> 03:19.624
- And play nicely.
- Don't I always?

03:20.627 --> 03:22.360
- Keep CIU in the loop.
- Mm-hmm.

03:22.429 --> 03:25.763
Try not to step on NYPD's toes
during an active investigation.

03:25.832 --> 03:28.099
Because one way or another...

03:28.201 --> 03:29.734
we've got a murderer on the loose.

03:34.507 --> 03:39.903
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

03:53.059 --> 03:55.693
Someone took a deep dive
on the Black Orchid Killer.

03:55.795 --> 03:57.228
How did you dig this up so fast?

03:57.297 --> 03:59.664
Some of it's from the files,
some is my own personal research.

03:59.766 --> 04:02.400
- Personal research?
- I'm kind of into serial killers.

04:02.535 --> 04:04.035
- Wow.
- I've read a lot about them.

04:04.170 --> 04:06.637
Note to self... do not stay late
in the office with blondie.

04:06.740 --> 04:08.439
I got interested
after my aunt was murdered.

04:08.541 --> 04:10.375
I wanted to understand...

04:10.477 --> 04:12.577
how people could do
such terrible things.

04:12.679 --> 04:14.512
Anyway, I've always
had my doubts about Clark Sims

04:14.614 --> 04:15.813
being the Black Orchid Killer.

04:15.915 --> 04:17.714
- Based on what?
- Among other things,

04:17.784 --> 04:20.084
he continues to insist he's innocent.

04:20.185 --> 04:21.786
Serial killers generally want credit.

04:21.887 --> 04:25.089
Beyond that, Sims fits
the FBI profile to a "T".

04:25.191 --> 04:26.724
His mother, who had a similar appearance

04:26.826 --> 04:28.126
to the victims, was an alcoholic.

04:28.228 --> 04:30.161
His father abandoned the family
when Clark was six.

04:30.296 --> 04:31.662
At the risk of bringing up evidence

04:31.765 --> 04:33.898
instead of this profiling nonsense,

04:34.000 --> 04:37.068
Sims lived near
victim number one, Hannah Lund,

04:37.170 --> 04:39.103
and went to the bank
where victim number three,

04:39.205 --> 04:40.304
Caitlin O'Brien, was a teller.

04:40.407 --> 04:41.539
How do you know all this?

04:41.641 --> 04:43.408
I was just made detective
when B.O.K. got started.

04:43.510 --> 04:45.209
I must have run 1,000 leads
on the tip line.

04:45.311 --> 04:46.444
Sims also left a fingerprint

04:46.546 --> 04:47.912
on the inside of the bedroom window

04:48.014 --> 04:49.313
of victim three, Caitlin O'Brien.

04:49.416 --> 04:50.615
Well, that's pretty damning.

04:50.717 --> 04:52.150
His fingerprints were in the system

04:52.252 --> 04:53.284
because of a trespassing charge

04:53.420 --> 04:55.119
when he stalked his ex-girlfriend.

04:55.221 --> 04:56.354
What about victim number two?

04:56.456 --> 04:57.655
May DeFranco.

04:57.757 --> 04:59.757
She was savagely beaten but survived.

04:59.859 --> 05:01.793
Clark Sims had no connection to her.

05:01.895 --> 05:03.327
And besides the fingerprint,

05:03.430 --> 05:05.663
the case against Sims
was circumstantial.

05:05.765 --> 05:07.565
But people wanted
the killer off the street,

05:07.667 --> 05:09.033
and, apparently, he's an odd guy.

05:09.135 --> 05:10.401
Yeah, but his oddness doesn't explain

05:10.503 --> 05:12.537
why the killings stopped
when Sims was locked up.

05:12.639 --> 05:14.372
Could be a coincidence.

05:14.474 --> 05:16.274
I'd like to talk to him.

05:16.376 --> 05:19.644
Sure, and I'm not just saying that
because I am now scared of you.

05:19.746 --> 05:20.945
Sam, go with her.

05:21.047 --> 05:24.215
Maxine, go get the files
on the previous NYPD investigation.

05:24.317 --> 05:26.251
Frankie, let's go and notify
the surviving victim.

05:35.361 --> 05:36.360
You're pretty.

05:36.463 --> 05:38.729
Thank you.

05:38.832 --> 05:40.131
I shouldn't have said that.

05:40.233 --> 05:42.867
Did I make you uncomfortable?

05:42.969 --> 05:44.769
A little.

05:44.871 --> 05:45.803
I'm sorry.

05:45.905 --> 05:47.972
I have this habit

05:48.074 --> 05:51.876
of saying the first thing
that pops into my head.

05:55.482 --> 05:58.382
Why is the CIU taking my case?

05:58.485 --> 06:00.017
I didn't file an appeal.

06:00.119 --> 06:02.987
The district attorney asked us
to review your conviction.

06:03.089 --> 06:05.323
I heard there was another killing.

06:05.425 --> 06:07.358
Like the others?

06:07.460 --> 06:09.160
There were similarities.

06:09.262 --> 06:12.730
I wonder where he's been
all these years.

06:14.934 --> 06:16.667
The Black Orchid Killer.

06:16.769 --> 06:18.436
Well, right now, that's you.

06:18.538 --> 06:20.571
But maybe you inspired a copycat.

06:20.707 --> 06:22.507
I didn't inspire anything.

06:22.609 --> 06:25.843
I didn't kill those women.

06:25.945 --> 06:27.411
Why are you checking the clock?

06:27.547 --> 06:29.747
I don't want to miss lunch.

06:29.849 --> 06:31.682
We have 37 minutes.

06:31.784 --> 06:34.819
My cellblock gets to go first
because we're the neatest.

06:34.921 --> 06:37.488
Tell me about when you stalked
your ex-girlfriend.

06:37.624 --> 06:38.689
You were 25.

06:38.791 --> 06:40.691
I wasn't stalking her.

06:40.793 --> 06:42.627
She broke up with me.

06:42.729 --> 06:45.730
But she had one
of my John Grisham books.

06:45.832 --> 06:47.265
I went to get it.

06:47.367 --> 06:50.001
Clark, how were your fingerprints

06:50.103 --> 06:52.069
on the inside
of Caitlin O'Brien's window

06:52.171 --> 06:53.905
if you had never met her?

06:53.930 --> 06:56.263
I don't know.

07:00.213 --> 07:02.179
You're... different

07:02.248 --> 07:05.483
than the cops and the FBI.

07:05.585 --> 07:09.587
They asked a lot of questions
about when I was a kid.

07:09.689 --> 07:10.721
Weird.

07:12.625 --> 07:15.560
They were evaluating you
for the Macdonald Triad.

07:15.662 --> 07:16.994
What's that?

07:17.096 --> 07:20.998
A fascination with fire,
some form of animal torture,

07:21.100 --> 07:23.568
and chronic bed-wetting
after the age of 12.

07:23.670 --> 07:25.736
Most serial killers have
at least two of the three.

07:25.838 --> 07:26.971
And according to your file,

07:27.073 --> 07:28.573
you were suspended in
high school for setting a fire.

07:28.675 --> 07:31.008
And the bed-wetting.

07:31.110 --> 07:35.913
So that's why people think I'm guilty.

07:36.015 --> 07:38.316
I check all those boxes.

07:38.418 --> 07:41.285
And I know I'm strange.

07:43.289 --> 07:46.624
I wonder how many boxes
the real killer will check...

07:46.726 --> 07:48.426
if they catch him.

08:00.506 --> 08:02.440
What's CIU doing here?

08:02.542 --> 08:04.842
This is an NYPD crime scene.

08:04.944 --> 08:07.044
Well, I'm not here officially.

08:07.146 --> 08:09.046
Just checking up on an old friend.

08:09.148 --> 08:11.148
- How you been, Nick?
- Good.

08:11.250 --> 08:13.084
Still breathing, still single.

08:13.186 --> 08:14.585
What about you?

08:14.687 --> 08:16.020
Ashton and Bobby doing okay?

08:16.122 --> 08:17.888
Ashton's great.

08:17.991 --> 08:19.590
Bobby and I got divorced.

08:19.659 --> 08:21.092
That's too bad.

08:21.194 --> 08:22.827
I just wanted to make sure
things weren't gonna be weird,

08:22.929 --> 08:24.195
given our history.

08:24.297 --> 08:27.365
Not as long as you steer clear
of my investigation.

08:27.467 --> 08:30.167
I'll do my job, you do yours.

08:30.269 --> 08:32.669
Thing is, your job
is to make it look like

08:32.772 --> 08:34.839
I screwed up the first time around.

08:34.941 --> 08:36.941
All I'm after is the truth.

08:38.144 --> 08:41.479
If you didn't make a mistake,
then there's nothing to worry about.

08:46.819 --> 08:49.053
Who's there?

08:49.155 --> 08:50.721
Uh, Ms. DeFranco, I'm Hayes Morrison.

08:50.823 --> 08:52.757
This is Franklin Cruz from the CIU.

08:52.892 --> 08:55.660
We would like to talk to you
about Clark Sims.

08:55.762 --> 08:57.595
I need to see your credentials.

09:00.033 --> 09:01.198
Now his.

09:14.347 --> 09:15.680
Please hurry.

09:29.829 --> 09:32.229
Ms. DeFranco, we're here
to inform you that...

09:32.331 --> 09:36.167
I called Cestero
as soon as I saw the news.

09:36.269 --> 09:38.202
That woman who was killed
looks just like me.

09:38.304 --> 09:39.603
There is a resemblance, yes, but we...

09:39.672 --> 09:40.838
Cestero said not to worry,

09:40.940 --> 09:42.073
that Clark Sims is locked up tight.

09:42.208 --> 09:43.240
That's true, but Mr. Sims...

09:43.342 --> 09:44.975
But there's a chance
the B.O.K. is still out there.

09:45.078 --> 09:46.177
There's a chance.

09:47.714 --> 09:49.780
I mean, if the CIU is looking
into Clark Sims' case,

09:49.882 --> 09:51.215
he might not be guilty.

09:51.350 --> 09:52.750
You know, why don't
we have a seat so we can...

09:52.852 --> 09:54.719
- Please.
- I'm sorry.

09:56.856 --> 09:59.657
I have been doing
so much better this past year.

10:00.993 --> 10:04.361
Finally feeling less afraid,
like I can take care of myself.

10:07.066 --> 10:09.066
This news really threw me.

10:09.168 --> 10:10.901
I can only imagine.

10:11.003 --> 10:13.637
May, I know this is difficult for you,

10:13.740 --> 10:16.373
but can you tell us about the attack?

10:20.012 --> 10:24.381
Um... I came home that night.

10:24.484 --> 10:27.852
I was in school
to be a physical therapist.

10:28.426 --> 10:30.335
Exams were the next day.

10:31.858 --> 10:36.293
I was... home alone reading a textbook.

10:38.231 --> 10:40.765
He came up behind me
and grabbed me by the neck.

10:40.867 --> 10:43.200
Police report said you didn't
get a look at him.

10:43.302 --> 10:44.502
I didn't.

10:44.604 --> 10:47.338
All I remember before he hit me

10:47.440 --> 10:50.040
was the sleeve of his coveralls
scratching my face.

10:50.143 --> 10:52.367
I was in a coma for almost a year.

10:52.512 --> 10:54.695
Couldn't even testify at the trial.

11:04.991 --> 11:08.659
May said B.O.K. was wearing
coveralls when he attacked her.

11:08.728 --> 11:10.795
Look at Clark's booking photo.

11:10.897 --> 11:12.630
He's wearing coveralls.

11:12.732 --> 11:16.206
Maybe May doesn't have anything
to worry about after all.

11:27.780 --> 11:30.014
It's interesting about the coveralls.

11:30.116 --> 11:32.183
That wasn't in the court record, was it?

11:32.285 --> 11:34.585
May DeFranco never had
a chance to testify.

11:34.687 --> 11:36.921
She was in a coma
during Clark Sims' trial.

11:37.023 --> 11:39.390
Is there any update
from Detective Cestero?

11:39.492 --> 11:40.524
No.

11:40.626 --> 11:41.592
Want me to check in?

11:41.694 --> 11:42.660
Sure.

11:46.833 --> 11:49.600
Actually, no. This is our time.

11:49.702 --> 11:52.503
We're gonna focus on something
other than work.

11:55.374 --> 11:56.941
Okay.

11:57.043 --> 11:58.242
Like what?

11:58.344 --> 12:00.945
We're gonna have a conversation

12:01.047 --> 12:03.614
like people do in a relationship.

12:03.716 --> 12:05.382
Okay.

12:05.484 --> 12:07.751
- But work is off-limits?
- Right.

12:18.631 --> 12:20.130
There's always not talking.

12:20.199 --> 12:22.700
No.

12:25.404 --> 12:27.238
Okay.

12:27.340 --> 12:29.640
I've taken up boxing.

12:29.742 --> 12:30.741
Competitively?

12:30.843 --> 12:33.210
No, for exercise. It's great cardio.

12:33.346 --> 12:34.578
Interesting.

12:34.680 --> 12:38.582
It's really... reinvigorated
my interest in the sport.

12:38.684 --> 12:39.783
And I'm boring you.

12:39.886 --> 12:42.720
No! You're not at all.

12:44.423 --> 12:46.957
Yes, you are. You are.

12:51.998 --> 12:53.731
It's the office.

12:59.338 --> 13:00.471
Yes.

13:00.573 --> 13:03.908
Clark Sims is giving
a phone interview on WABC.

13:04.010 --> 13:06.277
Turn on WABC. What's he saying?

13:06.379 --> 13:09.146
While convicted in 2006

13:09.282 --> 13:11.415
of being the Black Orchid Killer,

13:11.484 --> 13:14.151
he has always maintained his innocence.

13:14.253 --> 13:17.621
Mr. Sims, you have
an exclusive announcement

13:17.723 --> 13:18.789
for our audience?

13:18.891 --> 13:20.491
That's right.

13:20.593 --> 13:23.661
I've decided it's time
for me to come clean

13:23.763 --> 13:26.196
and finally admit the truth.

13:26.299 --> 13:29.133
I am the Black Orchid Killer.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.557
_

13:38.582 --> 13:40.182
Why did you lie to that reporter?

13:40.284 --> 13:42.317
I didn't lie. I'm a killer.

13:42.419 --> 13:44.853
I deserve to be behind bars
for the rest of my life.

13:44.955 --> 13:47.355
Three hours and two minutes
till lunchtime.

13:50.694 --> 13:51.693
You like the food here?

13:51.762 --> 13:54.429
It's not bad.

13:54.531 --> 13:55.797
You get to choose what you eat?

13:55.899 --> 13:57.699
No, but that's okay.

13:57.801 --> 13:59.548
- How's your cellmate?
- He's nice.

13:59.636 --> 14:01.970
He lets me clean the cell.

14:02.039 --> 14:04.906
What about the guards?
They treat you all right?

14:05.008 --> 14:06.641
If you stay in line, they do.

14:06.743 --> 14:09.477
- Do you stay in line?
- Always have, always will.

14:09.613 --> 14:11.646
And where does killing women
fit into that?

14:12.850 --> 14:16.351
- Lunch is in three hours and...
- It's in three hours and one minute.

14:18.555 --> 14:21.523
I want to tell you a story.

14:24.528 --> 14:26.628
I was a witness to a murder,

14:26.730 --> 14:30.799
and my testimony put
the wrong man in prison.

14:30.901 --> 14:32.400
But you didn't mean
to do the wrong thing.

14:32.502 --> 14:33.602
No, I didn't.

14:33.670 --> 14:35.737
And recently...

14:35.839 --> 14:37.806
he forgave me.

14:37.908 --> 14:39.641
That's nice.

14:39.743 --> 14:40.742
It is.

14:40.878 --> 14:43.345
He moved on with his life.

14:43.447 --> 14:44.813
But...

14:44.948 --> 14:48.483
I can't seem to.

14:51.121 --> 14:53.989
I got comfortable feeling bad
about what I did.

14:55.525 --> 14:59.194
Comfortable constantly worrying
about whether he was okay.

14:59.296 --> 15:02.597
And those feelings...

15:02.699 --> 15:05.267
defined me and everything I did.

15:05.369 --> 15:09.537
And now it's like there's
this hole where that used to be.

15:13.377 --> 15:18.346
You're comfortable in here.

15:19.249 --> 15:21.583
Aren't you, Clark?

15:21.685 --> 15:22.918
Lunch is in three hours.

15:23.020 --> 15:26.521
It feels safe for you
because of the routines.

15:33.297 --> 15:35.263
I think you're innocent.

15:37.167 --> 15:39.567
But you're afraid
if we prove it and you get out,

15:39.670 --> 15:42.037
you won't know how to cope.

15:44.608 --> 15:48.109
I'm not a normal person.

15:48.211 --> 15:49.711
I've never really fit in.

15:51.949 --> 15:53.848
I know the feeling.

15:56.987 --> 15:58.153
If you get out,

15:58.255 --> 16:00.755
we'll get you into a program
to help you adjust.

16:00.857 --> 16:03.825
We'll find a new routine for you.

16:03.927 --> 16:05.026
Okay?

16:07.130 --> 16:08.196
Please.

16:10.867 --> 16:12.934
Tell me the truth.

16:18.008 --> 16:19.808
I didn't kill anybody.

16:26.249 --> 16:28.316
I visited Clark again this morning.

16:28.418 --> 16:29.884
He isn't a killer.

16:29.987 --> 16:31.519
You got to admit, he's a pretty odd guy.

16:31.621 --> 16:34.356
He's got OCD and probably
a touch of Asperger's.

16:34.424 --> 16:36.191
And thanks to the past 10 years,

16:36.326 --> 16:38.326
he's gotten so used to being in prison,

16:38.428 --> 16:40.161
he can't imagine life any other way.

16:40.263 --> 16:41.830
I used to know guys like that inside.

16:41.932 --> 16:44.165
Clark is scared of getting out.

16:44.267 --> 16:46.701
And you think that's why he confessed?
You believe him?

16:46.803 --> 16:48.136
I really do.

16:48.238 --> 16:49.971
Well, unfortunately, your faith in him

16:50.073 --> 16:51.573
doesn't equal actual innocence.

16:51.675 --> 16:54.809
But lack of opportunity
on Clark's part might.

16:54.911 --> 16:58.646
Clark worked at Algron Supply Company
on the Lower East Side.

16:58.749 --> 17:01.316
On the day Caitlin O'Brien,
the third victim, was murdered,

17:01.418 --> 17:03.351
he didn't clock out until 5:30.

17:03.453 --> 17:08.323
But the coroner put her time of death
at no later than 6:00.

17:08.425 --> 17:10.090
Did he even have time
to commit the murder?

17:10.160 --> 17:12.460
According to Cestero's case notes, yes.

17:12.561 --> 17:14.362
He had the uniforms run
the route from the warehouse.

17:14.464 --> 17:16.330
Maybe someone else punched Clark out?

17:16.433 --> 17:18.566
Or the time clock
was calibrated improperly.

17:18.667 --> 17:21.236
No, if Clark didn't kill O'Brien,

17:21.338 --> 17:23.304
how did his fingerprint
end up on her window?

17:23.406 --> 17:25.173
I can re-run the print.

17:25.275 --> 17:27.008
See how many minutiae points match up.

17:27.109 --> 17:28.076
Great.

17:28.178 --> 17:29.411
Grab Maxine, go to the warehouse,

17:29.513 --> 17:31.980
find out if Cestero was
using the correct timeline.

17:41.425 --> 17:42.457
I'm the manager now,

17:42.559 --> 17:44.926
but I used to work the floor
with Clark Sims.

17:45.028 --> 17:46.594
He was a good man.

17:46.696 --> 17:48.496
You must have been surprised
when he was arrested.

17:48.598 --> 17:49.931
Oh, more than surprised.

17:50.033 --> 17:52.200
Now I'm not saying that Clark
wasn't an odd duck,

17:52.302 --> 17:54.769
but he was funny and hardworking.

17:54.871 --> 17:57.205
I liked doing deliveries with him.

17:57.307 --> 17:59.941
Ah, time clock stubs are in the office.

18:00.010 --> 18:03.144
Clark was a real stickler for time.

18:03.246 --> 18:05.713
He never would have let anyone
punch in and out for him.

18:05.816 --> 18:06.881
And the clock's accurate?

18:06.983 --> 18:07.882
To the minute.

18:07.984 --> 18:09.918
The boss is a real penny-pincher.

18:10.020 --> 18:12.153
And you guys deliver to
contractors all over the city?

18:12.255 --> 18:13.521
That's right.

18:13.623 --> 18:15.990
Roofing, plumbing, electrical,
pretty much everything.

18:16.093 --> 18:17.292
Do you guys ever deliver windows?

18:17.360 --> 18:19.127
Of course.

18:20.864 --> 18:23.598
Any chance you've got records of
your deliveries from 10 years ago?

18:25.102 --> 18:26.634
Yeah.

18:29.689 --> 18:30.738
We going to dinner?

18:30.841 --> 18:32.874
Yes, we are.

18:35.112 --> 18:36.811
Where we will not talk about work.

18:36.913 --> 18:38.880
Absolutely not.

18:38.982 --> 18:41.516
So I will not tell you about the
big break in the B.O.K. case.

18:41.618 --> 18:42.917
We're not at dinner yet.

18:43.053 --> 18:46.121
Sam and Maxine uncovered that in '06,

18:46.189 --> 18:48.089
Clark Sims delivered double-pane windows

18:48.191 --> 18:49.958
to a contractor in Queens,

18:50.060 --> 18:54.062
who then installed them
in 2236-01 East 61st Street,

18:54.131 --> 18:57.832
also known as
Caitlin O'Brien's townhouse,

18:57.934 --> 18:59.534
five months before the murder.

18:59.636 --> 19:01.503
Which would explain
why Clark Sims' fingerprint

19:01.605 --> 19:03.838
was inside the crime scene
even though he never was.

19:03.907 --> 19:05.707
Clark Sims may not be the B.O.K.

19:05.809 --> 19:07.642
And that is the end of shop talk.

19:07.744 --> 19:09.344
Indeed.

19:09.446 --> 19:11.846
Of course, this does mean that there's
a serial killer on the loose.

19:11.948 --> 19:13.515
Or maybe not.

19:13.617 --> 19:15.316
Detective Cestero
just picked up a suspect

19:15.418 --> 19:16.951
in the Marla Higgins murder.

19:26.484 --> 19:28.236
_

19:28.269 --> 19:31.938
You'll get Cestero to let us
interview his suspect.

19:33.742 --> 19:35.308
And I am talking about work.

19:35.410 --> 19:37.910
Good morning.

19:42.450 --> 19:44.517
Go ahead. I know you want to.

19:44.619 --> 19:47.153
We need to clear Sims of any
involvement with the B.O.K. murders.

19:47.255 --> 19:48.521
Best way to do that...

19:48.623 --> 19:51.157
Pin them on the guy Cestero's
already got in custody.

19:51.259 --> 19:52.525
That's fine.

19:52.627 --> 19:53.659
Just let him take the lead

19:53.762 --> 19:55.361
on tying his suspect to the B.O.K.

19:55.463 --> 19:56.462
Right.

19:56.564 --> 19:57.897
It is his case.

19:57.999 --> 19:59.532
Which he screwed up
the first time around.

19:59.634 --> 20:00.867
That hasn't been proven.

20:00.969 --> 20:03.970
That's the only reason why
Clark Sims isn't a free man yet.

20:04.072 --> 20:06.305
Might as well have your team at CIU

20:06.407 --> 20:08.541
make sure that the NYPD,
this time, get it right.

20:08.643 --> 20:09.876
That's a little rough.

20:09.978 --> 20:11.844
Not compared to me making an application

20:11.946 --> 20:14.680
to get Clark Sims released based
on the new evidence we found.

20:14.783 --> 20:16.082
The application goes public,

20:16.184 --> 20:18.684
and the citizens
of this great city are in panic

20:18.787 --> 20:21.654
because a self-professed
serial killer is on the streets.

20:21.756 --> 20:24.023
You wouldn't do that.

20:28.029 --> 20:30.997
I'll get you access to the suspect.

20:31.099 --> 20:33.800
It's Tess... again.

20:34.769 --> 20:35.935
The sun is barely up.

20:36.037 --> 20:37.170
It's 9:00 a.m.

20:37.272 --> 20:38.538
What's going on?

20:38.640 --> 20:40.673
I spent the night doing
my own profile of the B.O.K.

20:40.775 --> 20:42.275
with no reference to Clark Sims.

20:42.377 --> 20:43.476
You know, totally objective...

20:43.578 --> 20:45.545
Uh, okay, great. When I get

20:45.647 --> 20:46.946
- to the office, we'll...
- The B.O.K. is what the FBI

20:47.015 --> 20:48.915
refers to as "an organized killer."

20:49.017 --> 20:51.417
He plans every detail of his attacks.

20:51.486 --> 20:54.520
He's intelligent, patient,
takes pride in his work,

20:54.622 --> 20:56.689
enjoys stumping law enforcement.

20:56.791 --> 20:59.625
Clark has OCD, but he's shy.
He's not an alpha.

20:59.727 --> 21:00.927
Well, I've arranged...

21:00.995 --> 21:02.962
I need to meet with this
new suspect, talk with him.

21:03.064 --> 21:04.530
- Tess...
- Please. This is important.

21:04.632 --> 21:05.865
Get me in with him. I can help.

21:05.967 --> 21:08.134
Be quiet. Take yes for an answer.

21:08.236 --> 21:10.837
Call Maxine, get down to the 4th.

21:10.939 --> 21:12.171
Oh.

21:12.273 --> 21:13.973
Great.

21:14.075 --> 21:15.041
Thanks.

21:18.780 --> 21:21.147
I mean, how many times
I got to say this?

21:21.216 --> 21:23.516
I had lunch in my truck.

21:23.618 --> 21:25.351
I went back to work reading meters.

21:25.453 --> 21:27.653
Then I saw that poor lady
through the window.

21:27.755 --> 21:29.155
There was blood everywhere.

21:29.257 --> 21:31.157
So you broke in?

21:31.259 --> 21:32.425
I wanted to help her.

21:32.527 --> 21:34.627
But she was already dead,
so I figured I would...

21:34.729 --> 21:36.562
You're such a Good Samaritan, Joe.

21:36.664 --> 21:38.731
Why'd you do all that and you take off?

21:38.833 --> 21:42.001
You call 911 anonymously.

21:42.103 --> 21:44.503
I got a bunch of unpaid parking tickets.

21:44.606 --> 21:46.274
I was worried if I got involved,
it may be some...

21:46.299 --> 21:48.474
Involved? Or caught, Joe?

21:48.610 --> 21:51.611
Guys like him...
it's why I didn't stick around.

21:51.679 --> 21:54.380
Detective Cestero is just doing his job.

21:54.482 --> 21:55.848
By railroading innocent people?

21:55.950 --> 21:58.150
Sure. Why not?

21:58.253 --> 21:59.919
Just a couple more questions.

22:00.021 --> 22:02.188
Were you living in the city in 2006?

22:02.257 --> 22:03.890
I was born and bred in Queens,

22:03.958 --> 22:07.560
been working for the utility
company since 2005.

22:07.629 --> 22:12.298
Do you remember where you were August
24th and September 3rd of '06?

22:12.400 --> 22:14.967
Probably on my yacht in South Hampton.

22:15.069 --> 22:17.803
You'd have to ask my butler
to know for sure.

22:17.906 --> 22:20.306
Maybe you kept a calendar.

22:20.375 --> 22:23.075
Best I can do is
have you check with dispatch.

22:23.144 --> 22:25.044
Did you ever hear about
the Black Orchid Killer, Joe?

22:25.113 --> 22:25.945
Detective Cestero.

22:26.814 --> 22:29.215
What?

22:29.317 --> 22:31.717
No way. I'm not him.

22:31.819 --> 22:34.153
I didn't kill anyone now or then.

22:34.255 --> 22:36.489
Three witnesses saw you
running from the crime scene.

22:36.591 --> 22:38.124
They saw wrong.

22:38.226 --> 22:39.792
You were covered in blood.

22:39.894 --> 22:43.029
Best thing you can do is come clean.

22:43.131 --> 22:46.699
Ask me any question you want,
take my DNA, whatever.

22:46.801 --> 22:48.334
I didn't do anything.

22:48.436 --> 22:50.269
Sorry. So sorry.

22:50.371 --> 22:52.471
Stop talking. Ask for a lawyer...

22:52.573 --> 22:53.506
now.

22:55.276 --> 22:56.876
I'm done talking.

22:56.978 --> 22:58.611
I want a lawyer.

23:00.815 --> 23:04.350
I let you speak to my suspect
and you push him to lawyer up?

23:04.452 --> 23:05.918
She did you a favor.

23:06.020 --> 23:06.986
You should have read him his rights

23:07.088 --> 23:08.321
before you started accusing him.

23:08.423 --> 23:10.656
Everything he said
would have been inadmissible.

23:10.758 --> 23:12.124
It's a close call on that.

23:12.193 --> 23:14.193
- Yeah, well, you made the wrong one.
- It doesn't matter.

23:14.295 --> 23:16.662
Joe Kaplan isn't
the Black Orchid Killer.

23:16.764 --> 23:18.197
And you know this how?

23:18.299 --> 23:19.498
I've studied serial killers.

23:19.600 --> 23:20.733
You read a couple of books.

23:20.835 --> 23:22.101
More than a couple.

23:22.203 --> 23:24.837
Kaplan's comments about having
a butler and a yacht...

23:24.939 --> 23:26.806
those were self-deprecating jokes.

23:26.908 --> 23:29.108
A real serial killer would have
too grandiose a self-image

23:29.177 --> 23:30.576
to make those kinds of comments.

23:30.678 --> 23:31.744
You think I'm wrong,

23:31.846 --> 23:34.013
go speak to the three witnesses
that saw him.

23:34.115 --> 23:36.048
And then you'll see.

23:38.510 --> 23:40.510
You did good.

23:42.357 --> 23:44.924
Yeah, this is the guy I saw.

23:45.026 --> 23:46.425
Near the victim's apartment?

23:46.527 --> 23:47.660
Uh-huh.

23:47.762 --> 23:48.894
He was covered in blood.

23:48.997 --> 23:50.429
All over his hands.

23:50.498 --> 23:52.298
The blood soaked through his uniform.

23:52.400 --> 23:53.532
What kind of uniform?

23:53.634 --> 23:54.700
Some kind of coverall.

23:54.836 --> 23:56.068
What were you doing
in that neighborhood?

23:56.170 --> 23:58.571
Picking up my favorite
cheese Danish at Du Bois.

23:58.673 --> 24:00.139
I had a clear view from my apartment.

24:00.241 --> 24:01.440
I live across the street.

24:01.542 --> 24:02.908
I was walking my dog.

24:02.977 --> 24:05.745
I saw him sitting there
in his truck, all alone.

24:05.847 --> 24:07.613
How long did you see him sitting there?

24:07.715 --> 24:10.149
He was parked when I stopped
for coffee, so...

24:10.251 --> 24:11.150
It's hard to say.

24:11.252 --> 24:13.219
45 minutes, an hour maybe?

24:13.321 --> 24:15.821
I passed his truck when I got home,

24:15.890 --> 24:18.124
and he was just staring at me.

24:18.226 --> 24:19.725
Kind of creeped me out.

24:19.827 --> 24:23.229
Something felt
weird about him, you know?

24:23.331 --> 24:25.464
I would have called the cops,
but my phone died.

24:25.566 --> 24:27.166
And then he got out of his truck.

24:27.268 --> 24:28.234
He got out of his truck,

24:28.302 --> 24:29.502
headed straight for her building.

24:29.604 --> 24:30.636
I could see him looking.

24:30.738 --> 24:32.538
I could see him looking in her window.

24:32.640 --> 24:34.407
She was in a ground-floor apartment.

24:34.509 --> 24:35.908
I almost confronted him.

24:36.010 --> 24:37.410
Told him to get away from the window,

24:37.512 --> 24:39.979
but I decided
better mind my own business.

24:40.081 --> 24:41.814
Didn't want to start a fight.

24:41.916 --> 24:45.484
And you're certain that this
is the man you saw?

24:45.586 --> 24:48.087
Yes. Definitely.

24:48.189 --> 24:49.321
No doubt about it.

24:49.424 --> 24:52.425
It was him. I'd bet my life on it.

24:54.695 --> 24:56.662
Like Joe said, he's been working

24:56.764 --> 24:58.864
with the utility company since 2005,

24:58.966 --> 25:00.866
and, according to dispatch logs,

25:00.968 --> 25:02.468
he was working in Manhattan

25:02.570 --> 25:04.136
on the days of the B.O.K. killings.

25:04.238 --> 25:05.037
That sounds promising.

25:05.139 --> 25:06.238
Except there's no record

25:06.340 --> 25:08.607
of exactly where he was in the city.

25:08.709 --> 25:10.676
Did they have GPS tracking
on trucks back then?

25:10.778 --> 25:13.345
No, didn't start that until 2011.

25:13.448 --> 25:15.381
That doesn't alibi him out, either.

25:15.483 --> 25:18.117
Sometimes textbook theories
don't pan out, Tess.

25:18.219 --> 25:21.220
I know, but Joe...
he just doesn't fit the profile.

25:21.322 --> 25:23.122
He's not B.O.K.

25:24.926 --> 25:25.758
What?

25:25.860 --> 25:26.959
Just got an e-mail...

25:27.095 --> 25:28.694
Joe's sealed juvenile records.

25:28.796 --> 25:30.062
How'd you get it?

25:31.365 --> 25:32.865
When you're on the hunt
for a serial killer,

25:32.967 --> 25:34.733
sometimes seals loosen up.

25:37.271 --> 25:39.805
We couldn't use this in court.

25:39.907 --> 25:41.340
But...

25:41.476 --> 25:43.042
She looks like the other victims.

25:43.144 --> 25:45.611
- Who is she?
- She's Joe's sister.

25:45.713 --> 25:48.547
He was accused of molesting her
when they were kids.

25:58.572 --> 26:00.446
_

26:00.471 --> 26:01.870
As you both know,

26:01.972 --> 26:04.339
a sealed juvenile record
is inadmissible in court.

26:04.441 --> 26:05.841
We won't need it
with multiple murder charges

26:05.943 --> 26:07.042
against your client.

26:07.144 --> 26:09.311
I was only 12 years old
when all this went down.

26:09.413 --> 26:10.612
Joe.

26:10.714 --> 26:12.848
And I didn't molest my sister.
It was all a big mix-up.

26:12.950 --> 26:14.149
Joe, let me handle this.

26:14.251 --> 26:15.684
Those women you killed,
they didn't matter to you.

26:15.786 --> 26:17.819
- They just looked like your sister.
- No.

26:17.921 --> 26:20.122
Yeah, those women look like
Sonya, but I didn't hurt...

26:20.224 --> 26:21.823
What my client is trying to say

26:21.925 --> 26:24.326
is that this matter
was adjudicated years ago

26:24.428 --> 26:27.262
and has no bearing on this
witch hunt you're engaged in.

26:27.364 --> 26:31.166
I didn't hurt those women,
and I didn't hurt Sonya.

26:31.268 --> 26:34.569
You don't... You don't even know
what sex is at that age.

26:34.671 --> 26:39.474
Our stepdad just saw
what he wanted to see.

26:39.576 --> 26:40.742
What about your sister?

26:40.844 --> 26:43.378
What's she gonna say about all this?

26:43.447 --> 26:45.480
My brother's not a murderer.

26:45.582 --> 26:46.548
How can you be so sure?

26:46.650 --> 26:48.116
Joe and I used to be close.

26:48.218 --> 26:50.619
We grew up in the same house
for 18 years.

26:50.721 --> 26:51.887
You get to know a person.

26:52.022 --> 26:53.855
It's been a long time
since you guys were kids.

26:53.957 --> 26:55.323
When was the last time you spoke?

26:55.426 --> 26:56.925
It's been a few years.

26:57.027 --> 26:59.194
Is that because
he molested you as a child?

26:59.296 --> 27:01.396
No, that was nothing.

27:01.498 --> 27:03.565
A stupid game.

27:03.667 --> 27:05.767
We were playing doctor,

27:05.869 --> 27:10.105
and our stepdad just... snapped.

27:10.207 --> 27:11.540
He grabbed Joe so hard,

27:11.675 --> 27:13.275
he nearly tore his arm
out of its socket.

27:13.343 --> 27:16.211
Gave him permanent nerve damage.

27:16.313 --> 27:17.712
I know he's your brother,

27:17.815 --> 27:19.414
but you shouldn't cover for him.

27:19.516 --> 27:21.750
Nobody wants to believe
that their loved ones

27:21.819 --> 27:23.418
are capable of terrible things.

27:23.520 --> 27:26.955
I don't believe it
because Joe wouldn't do that.

27:27.024 --> 27:29.357
Then why the estrangement
if you two are so close?

27:31.929 --> 27:35.363
My husband doesn't get along with Joe.

27:35.466 --> 27:39.201
Joe's a drinker.
My husband's in recovery.

27:39.303 --> 27:42.104
And...

27:42.206 --> 27:45.240
I made a choice for my family.

27:45.342 --> 27:47.676
But Joe never hurt me.

27:47.778 --> 27:50.545
And he didn't hurt those other women.

27:52.749 --> 27:55.250
Detective Cestero, thanks for coming by.

27:55.352 --> 27:57.452
I was surprised to hear from you
after yesterday.

27:57.554 --> 27:59.554
We may not agree about Joe Kaplan,

27:59.656 --> 28:01.890
but I figure we're both
after the same thing.

28:01.992 --> 28:03.225
The truth, yes.

28:03.327 --> 28:05.727
No matter who it points to.

28:12.536 --> 28:14.536
So what's all this?

28:14.638 --> 28:15.470
Hey.

28:15.572 --> 28:17.139
What's up, man? Frankie.

28:17.207 --> 28:19.274
Cestero.

28:19.343 --> 28:21.676
So these test dummies
are fitted with sensors

28:21.778 --> 28:23.945
that measure velocity
and force of impact.

28:24.047 --> 28:26.148
We're gonna see if Joe could
have killed any of these women.

28:26.250 --> 28:27.182
Of course he could have.

28:27.284 --> 28:29.017
His sister said Joe suffered

28:29.119 --> 28:30.685
a serious shoulder injury
when he was a child.

28:30.754 --> 28:32.554
We need to compare the amount of force

28:32.656 --> 28:34.689
B.O.K. used to kill his victims

28:34.791 --> 28:37.192
to the amount of force Joe was
actually capable of exerting.

28:37.227 --> 28:39.628
The latest victim was Marla Higgins.

28:52.242 --> 28:54.276
Autopsy shows she was hit
multiple times.

28:54.378 --> 28:57.112
But the first blow delivered
enough force to kill her.

29:12.596 --> 29:15.897
73 Newtons is what's required
to fracture the human skull.

29:15.999 --> 29:18.700
I just swung 78.

29:19.903 --> 29:22.204
See, bone is stronger
than concrete and steel.

29:22.306 --> 29:24.940
So the kind of damage found
in B.O.K.'s victims

29:25.042 --> 29:27.375
would have been 80 to 100 Newtons.

29:28.111 --> 29:30.111
Medical records show
Joe's childhood injury

29:30.214 --> 29:32.447
left him unable to raise
his right dominant hand

29:32.549 --> 29:34.249
above his head.

29:44.361 --> 29:47.095
Looks like the lower angle
only generates 50 Newtons.

29:47.197 --> 29:48.930
That's not enough.

29:49.032 --> 29:50.899
Whoever murdered these women
hit with more force

29:51.001 --> 29:52.567
than Joe was capable of.

29:52.669 --> 29:53.868
So he couldn't have killed Marla.

29:53.971 --> 29:55.470
Or any of the other women.

29:55.572 --> 29:56.972
And there's real doubts
about Clark's guilt

29:57.074 --> 29:58.573
in the original killings.

30:08.619 --> 30:10.919
The Black Orchid Killer
is still out there.

30:14.791 --> 30:16.691
Joe Kaplan should not be
in police custody.

30:16.793 --> 30:18.059
He should be released immediately.

30:18.161 --> 30:19.561
We can't do that.

30:19.663 --> 30:22.831
Frankie proved that Joe was physically
incapable of bludgeoning those women.

30:22.933 --> 30:24.933
- He's not B.O.K.
- Your team's experiments

30:25.035 --> 30:26.434
are not incontrovertible proof.

30:26.536 --> 30:28.069
Please, you don't want to let Kaplan go.

30:28.171 --> 30:29.237
He's still a suspect.

30:29.339 --> 30:30.739
Detective Cestero doesn't think so.

30:30.841 --> 30:32.774
The public needs reassurance.

30:32.876 --> 30:35.143
Not at the expense
of an innocent man's freedom.

30:35.245 --> 30:37.579
My job is to keep the city safe.

30:37.681 --> 30:40.982
If a couple of guys have
to spend an extra night or two

30:41.051 --> 30:43.785
as guests of the state
so the public stays calm

30:43.887 --> 30:45.887
while the NYPD continues to investigate

30:45.989 --> 30:47.722
these horrible crimes,

30:47.824 --> 30:49.457
it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

30:49.559 --> 30:52.594
That's not the only sacrifice
you'll be making.

30:52.696 --> 30:54.996
Oh, come on. Don't do this.

30:55.098 --> 30:57.666
Have fun tonight, alone.

30:57.768 --> 30:59.701
I've got two innocent men to exonerate.

31:07.292 --> 31:09.105
_

31:09.130 --> 31:10.863
Since there are
significant doubts that either

31:10.965 --> 31:13.432
Clark Sims or Joe Kaplan
are actually the B.O.K.,

31:13.501 --> 31:15.067
you two are gonna work together.

31:15.092 --> 31:16.081
- I don't need her.
- My team's got this.

31:16.106 --> 31:18.604
Shut up, both of you.

31:18.706 --> 31:20.840
Hayes and her team are well-versed
in the B.O.K. murders.

31:20.942 --> 31:21.907
That should be useful,

31:22.009 --> 31:23.376
considering you're trying to catch him.

31:23.478 --> 31:25.411
And catching the actual B.O.K.

31:25.446 --> 31:27.113
means that Clark Sims gets out of prison

31:27.215 --> 31:28.514
and Joe Kaplan gets released.

31:28.616 --> 31:30.483
It's a win-win.

31:31.619 --> 31:33.419
Way to get on board.

31:39.360 --> 31:42.061
We've been over both the files
from the previous B.O.K. attacks

31:42.163 --> 31:43.562
and the new case... dead end.

31:43.664 --> 31:45.731
Then we get inside the psycho's head,

31:45.833 --> 31:47.867
try and see it from his perspective.

31:47.969 --> 31:49.368
You do crazies... what's our next step?

31:49.470 --> 31:51.203
I think we should look at
the 10-year hiatus

31:51.305 --> 31:52.805
between Marla Higgins
and Caitlin O'Brien.

31:52.907 --> 31:54.273
Why did he stop killing?

31:54.375 --> 31:57.343
Some serial killers stop because
they get married or divorced,

31:57.445 --> 31:58.644
relocate for a new job.

31:58.746 --> 32:01.747
So we track every lonely man
in the tri-state area?

32:01.849 --> 32:05.084
Or maybe he was sick or moved away

32:05.186 --> 32:06.552
and just came back to New York.

32:06.654 --> 32:08.154
What if he didn't get sick?

32:08.256 --> 32:12.258
Or maybe he was incarcerated?

32:12.326 --> 32:15.761
Score one for the ex-con.

32:15.863 --> 32:17.997
Get the names of everyone
who went to prison in New York

32:18.099 --> 32:20.399
shortly after Caitlin O'Brien was killed

32:20.501 --> 32:22.468
and released just prior
to Marla's death.

32:22.537 --> 32:23.769
That could be hundreds of people.

32:23.871 --> 32:24.737
Try thousands.

32:24.839 --> 32:26.572
Better get started.

32:28.843 --> 32:32.111
Department of Corrections gave
us access to their online files,

32:32.213 --> 32:34.313
but, uh... this

32:34.449 --> 32:36.749
hasn't been scanned through
the system yet.

32:36.851 --> 32:38.851
We're looking for a needle
in a haystack.

32:38.953 --> 32:40.686
Based on what May DeFranco said

32:40.788 --> 32:42.755
and a profile of the killer
I've mocked up,

32:42.857 --> 32:44.356
I think we're looking for a white male

32:44.425 --> 32:47.293
between 5'5" and 6'
with a violent criminal history.

32:47.395 --> 32:49.261
Oh, so a needle in a huge haystack.

32:49.363 --> 32:51.397
Divide and conquer?

33:43.384 --> 33:45.484
- I need a break.
- Me too.

33:45.586 --> 33:47.386
I'm gonna make an
executive decision we take 20.

33:47.488 --> 33:48.787
Good by me.

33:48.978 --> 33:50.173
Calm down.

33:50.291 --> 33:52.291
Donald Cutler was one of the witnesses

33:52.393 --> 33:54.660
who saw Joe outside of
Marla Higgins' apartment, right?

33:54.762 --> 33:56.061
Yeah, I interviewed him.

33:56.130 --> 33:58.297
Yeah, he was one of the guys
who called the tip line. Why?

33:58.399 --> 34:00.599
He was arrested
for beating up his girlfriend

34:00.701 --> 34:02.635
three weeks after
Caitlin O'Brien was killed.

34:02.703 --> 34:05.437
15-year sentence,
got out in 10 for good behavior,

34:05.540 --> 34:07.006
was released two months ago.

34:07.108 --> 34:11.377
And, get this, he was abused
as a child by his foster mom.

34:11.478 --> 34:13.112
This woman.

34:13.214 --> 34:14.914
Oh, she's a ringer
for the other victims,

34:15.016 --> 34:16.415
right down to the color of her lipstick.

34:16.516 --> 34:18.284
- Did he kill her, too?
- Didn't get the chance.

34:18.386 --> 34:20.686
- She died of natural causes in her sleep.
- When?

34:20.788 --> 34:23.455
Three weeks before
the first B.O.K. killing.

34:23.558 --> 34:26.058
He must have been so frustrated
he couldn't punish her

34:26.159 --> 34:27.793
in the way that he thought
that she deserved.

34:27.895 --> 34:30.629
So he exorcised his demons
on all those women instead.

34:30.731 --> 34:31.931
I'll get a location on Don.

34:32.033 --> 34:33.666
Get us the address.
We'll get eyes on it.

34:33.734 --> 34:34.900
Yeah, I'll arrange for warrants.

35:12.340 --> 35:14.206
There's nothing hinky over here.

35:22.283 --> 35:24.717
He's got a lock-picking gun.

35:26.087 --> 35:27.386
Look at this.

35:27.488 --> 35:28.687
It's the layout for an apartment,

35:28.823 --> 35:30.089
but not this one.

35:31.759 --> 35:33.158
Whose address is that?

35:34.195 --> 35:35.898
May DeFranco.

35:36.093 --> 35:38.789
Looks like Don's planning to finish
what he started.

35:52.903 --> 35:54.736
They must be inside.

36:12.222 --> 36:14.155
He was like that when we got here.

36:14.258 --> 36:15.757
Seems he got in through the back door.

36:15.893 --> 36:17.292
She shot him.

36:19.963 --> 36:21.563
It's okay, May.

36:21.665 --> 36:23.665
He's dead.

36:23.767 --> 36:25.267
You sure?

36:26.436 --> 36:28.937
He will never hurt you again.

36:42.753 --> 36:45.987
May DeFranco killed Don Cutler.

36:46.089 --> 36:48.223
Good for her.

36:49.159 --> 36:50.539
Why didn't Don go after May

36:50.602 --> 36:53.094
the first time
he was released from prison?

36:53.196 --> 36:54.829
Maybe Marla Higgins was a test run?

36:54.932 --> 36:57.299
Don was out of practice,
he wanted to get the kinks out

36:57.401 --> 37:00.001
before he went back
to finish what he started.

37:00.103 --> 37:02.470
You are into some dark stuff, Tess.

37:03.740 --> 37:05.440
Could be useful around here.

37:11.915 --> 37:13.315
Felt good.

37:13.417 --> 37:14.582
Yeah, I bet.

37:21.491 --> 37:23.892
Hey, you forget something?

37:23.994 --> 37:25.060
Uh, no.

37:27.397 --> 37:31.599
I just wanted to say I did make
a mistake on Clark Sims.

37:32.970 --> 37:34.836
Thanks for helping me fix it.

37:34.938 --> 37:37.172
Just doing my job.

37:39.176 --> 37:41.509
Don't forget about Joe Kaplan.

37:41.611 --> 37:43.945
Kind of screwed up there, too.

37:44.047 --> 37:46.915
Still the same ball buster, huh?

37:47.017 --> 37:48.950
You know it.

38:39.202 --> 38:41.102
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:41.204 --> 38:43.505
So...

38:43.607 --> 38:45.006
are we over it?

38:45.108 --> 38:47.208
- Our fight?
- Yeah.

38:47.310 --> 38:48.676
I think so.

38:48.779 --> 38:50.812
Good.

39:00.557 --> 39:03.458
Did you know they found
Amelia Earhart's skeleton?

39:03.527 --> 39:05.026
Yeah, on some island.

39:05.128 --> 39:07.429
Nikumaroro, Kiribati.

39:07.531 --> 39:09.464
They think she was a castaway,

39:09.566 --> 39:10.965
didn't die in the crash.

39:11.034 --> 39:13.268
Interesting. Did they find the plane?

39:17.007 --> 39:19.307
This is stupid.

39:19.409 --> 39:21.309
She was the first woman
to fly solo around the world.

39:21.411 --> 39:22.610
We should just talk about work.

39:22.712 --> 39:23.878
I thought this was our time.

39:23.980 --> 39:25.346
It is, but let's face it...

39:25.449 --> 39:27.882
- Our jobs are a big deal for both of us.
- You're welcome.

39:27.984 --> 39:30.485
Of course we're gonna talk about it.

39:30.587 --> 39:32.387
Couple knuckleheads like us?

39:32.456 --> 39:33.955
We talk about it,

39:34.057 --> 39:35.623
we're gonna fight about it, too.

39:35.759 --> 39:39.127
I wouldn't have it any other way.
