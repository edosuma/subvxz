WEBVTT

00:00.013 --> 00:02.610
We discovered a serious breach
of security.

00:02.613 --> 00:05.681
The information contained
within the walls of this building

00:05.683 --> 00:09.522
is of a highly sensitive nature.
Trying to obtain it is a crime.

00:09.524 --> 00:11.683
That nice house you clean in Dulwich.

00:11.684 --> 00:13.683
Would it be so terrible
if you forgot to lock up

00:13.684 --> 00:15.723
- after yourself tomorrow?
- I'm not letting you steal from people

00:15.724 --> 00:17.683
who trust me with their homes.

00:17.684 --> 00:18.684
You're stealing from us.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.683
Then it's bailiffs, court hearings,
God knows what else.

00:20.684 --> 00:23.052
I found this in Blake's office.

00:23.053 --> 00:25.333
That's the phone he's been using
to call his contact - Swanny.

00:25.334 --> 00:27.683
There'll be all kinds of deals
we don't know about in there.

00:27.684 --> 00:29.363
- So, who are you?
- I'm a friend of Blake's.

00:29.364 --> 00:31.704
- You got a name?
- Nancy.

00:31.729 --> 00:32.799
I think you should meet with Graham.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.683
Think about the girls. What would
they do if something happens to you?

00:35.684 --> 00:37.683
- Pleased to meet you.
- Yeah.

00:37.684 --> 00:39.683
Pleased to meet you, too.

00:39.684 --> 00:41.883
So, we're just waiting for one more.

00:41.884 --> 00:45.237
Sorry, I'm late. I had a nightmare
getting away from work.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:21.884 --> 01:23.683
Frances, this is Nancy.

01:23.684 --> 01:26.283
She's been helping Blake
with the investments.

01:26.284 --> 01:27.683
Really?

01:27.684 --> 01:30.684
This is the first I've heard
of this. Since when?

01:31.164 --> 01:32.683
For quite a while.

01:32.684 --> 01:33.684
Nice to meet you.

01:34.164 --> 01:35.683
Have we met before?

01:35.684 --> 01:36.684
I... I recognise your face.

01:36.685 --> 01:39.683
No, I don't think so.
Maybe Blake introduced us.

01:39.684 --> 01:41.193
Yeah, maybe.

01:41.194 --> 01:44.140
Whatever. Look,
what is the latest with Blake?

01:44.141 --> 01:47.016
Well, he's been suspended.
Pending an investigation.

01:47.017 --> 01:49.016
So you should definitely
steer well clear.

01:49.017 --> 01:52.016
But don't worry.
The FCA are not going to find out.

01:52.017 --> 01:54.016
- I'm making sure of that.
- I am worried.

01:54.017 --> 01:56.016
And if this turns out
to be a problem for me,

01:56.017 --> 01:59.017
then I will take care of it myself.
Understood?

02:00.017 --> 02:02.503
Look, why don't we just order some food,

02:02.504 --> 02:04.446
then we can get down to business?

02:11.017 --> 02:13.017
Thanks.

02:24.017 --> 02:26.016
Right. As Blake probably told you,

02:26.017 --> 02:29.016
the Health Trust are selling off
Southwark General Hospital.

02:29.017 --> 02:30.297
What are they going to do with it?

02:30.298 --> 02:32.056
Well, that's what we'd like to know.

02:32.057 --> 02:34.017
Blake didn't mention this to you?

02:34.604 --> 02:38.016
Sorry, he did. He just didn't say
which hospital it was.

02:38.017 --> 02:41.016
As you know, there are three leading
contenders bidding for the contract.

02:41.017 --> 02:42.229
We don't know which way it's going to go.

02:42.230 --> 02:44.463
Walker Steens are the ones
that peaked our interest.

02:44.464 --> 02:47.376
Small cap firm,
trading around £4, £5 a share.

02:47.377 --> 02:49.345
They've got plans to convert it

02:49.346 --> 02:52.016
- into this five-star hotel.
- We think something like this

02:52.017 --> 02:53.567
could triple their current share price.

02:53.568 --> 02:56.006
If we move quickly, that is.

02:56.007 --> 02:58.306
What's the decline line, did you check?

02:58.307 --> 02:59.542
No, I didn't.

02:59.543 --> 03:01.411
Nancy?

03:01.436 --> 03:03.260
The advance, was it up or down?

03:04.004 --> 03:05.542
It was up.

03:05.543 --> 03:07.542
Shit. See?

03:07.543 --> 03:10.132
Room bills already starting to spin.

03:10.157 --> 03:11.898
If we block trade on this,

03:11.899 --> 03:13.542
what kind of exposure are we looking at?

03:13.543 --> 03:16.443
Well, without Blake,
it could be quite substantial.

03:16.444 --> 03:18.316
How much can you get away with?

03:19.243 --> 03:21.382
Well, that depends.
How much were you thinking?

03:21.383 --> 03:23.084
Er, 20,000 at least.

03:24.778 --> 03:27.367
That's a lot of money,
but I think that's OK.

03:27.638 --> 03:29.777
20,000 shares.

03:29.778 --> 03:32.777
I'm looking to invest
a quarter of a million on this.

03:32.778 --> 03:35.032
Yes, I know. Of course.

03:38.457 --> 03:40.062
How do you know Blake again?

03:40.063 --> 03:41.777
We used to work together.

03:41.778 --> 03:43.777
So Blake's been at Kramer & Lowe now
for what?

03:43.778 --> 03:46.777
About eight years? Is that where you met?

03:46.778 --> 03:49.249
Yeah, I worked there
a couple of years ago.

03:49.684 --> 03:51.457
Must have been before my time.

03:51.458 --> 03:52.978
I guess so.

03:54.778 --> 03:56.777
So, the hospital board are meeting
this week

03:56.778 --> 03:58.137
to vote on which firm they're going with.

03:58.138 --> 03:59.777
Blake had a contact on the inside.

03:59.778 --> 04:01.331
He was going to let us know the decision

04:01.332 --> 04:02.831
before it went public.

04:02.832 --> 04:04.977
- Do you know who that is?
- I don't.

04:04.978 --> 04:08.777
But I do have some people of my own.

04:08.778 --> 04:10.778
Maybe I could try and find out.

04:11.284 --> 04:13.932
I'd have to make it worth
their while, though.

04:15.351 --> 04:16.711
How much?

04:18.444 --> 04:19.777
50,000.

04:19.778 --> 04:22.682
Absolutely not.

04:22.683 --> 04:23.996
50,000?

04:24.029 --> 04:26.778
- No, I'm not interested.
- Would they take 30?

04:27.718 --> 04:29.777
Since when do we pay more than ten?

04:29.778 --> 04:33.073
It's a lot of money,
but I think this deal could be huge.

04:35.778 --> 04:37.457
I'm keen to move on this independently,

04:37.458 --> 04:39.811
- if you're not interested.
- Your money.

04:41.778 --> 04:44.778
- I could ask.
- I'd need some evidence, of course.

04:45.778 --> 04:48.778
- I hope you don't mind.
- No, of course not.

05:03.778 --> 05:06.777
Nancy! Where are you going now?

05:06.778 --> 05:09.272
I was just going home.
It was nice to meet you.

05:09.273 --> 05:11.777
- Where do you live?
- I'm in Dulwich.

05:11.778 --> 05:13.693
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

05:13.718 --> 05:14.777
Me too.

05:14.778 --> 05:16.297
Whereabouts?
Do you want to split this cab?

05:16.298 --> 05:18.777
No, no, no. I'm by the gallery.

05:18.778 --> 05:21.249
Very nice! That's not far from me.
Jump in!

05:22.404 --> 05:23.778
Thank you.

05:25.044 --> 05:26.778
That's kind of you.

05:31.298 --> 05:32.777
I really feel like I've met you before.

05:32.778 --> 05:35.778
- I just can't place it.
- No, I don't think so.

05:37.778 --> 05:39.777
- So you worked at Kramer & Lowe?
- That's right, yeah.

05:39.778 --> 05:41.777
And what year did you start?

05:41.778 --> 05:44.777
Erm, well, can't think.

05:44.778 --> 05:48.777
Well, it was before Blake,
so nine years ago?

05:48.778 --> 05:51.778
- How long were you there?
- Couple of years.

05:52.924 --> 05:54.777
Where are you now?

05:54.778 --> 05:58.778
Now I do a lot of consultancy work
for individual clients.

06:03.164 --> 06:05.457
So how did you get involved
with Swanny and Graham?

06:05.458 --> 06:07.777
Working in compliance,
a lot of things pass your way

06:07.778 --> 06:09.777
and I just...

06:09.778 --> 06:11.777
Well, I just discovered it was far easier

06:11.778 --> 06:14.777
to act dumb and turn a blind eye

06:14.778 --> 06:16.778
than give myself a headache.

06:17.364 --> 06:18.778
For a price, obviously.

06:20.778 --> 06:22.777
So, you married? Kids?

06:22.778 --> 06:24.777
Married. Two boys.

06:24.778 --> 06:27.618
- How about you?
- No. To both.

06:28.778 --> 06:30.777
I enjoy my own space too much.

06:32.778 --> 06:35.603
Nancy what, by the way?
I didn't catch your surname.

06:35.604 --> 06:36.778
Oliver.

06:51.778 --> 06:53.778
- Nice house!
- Thank you.

06:54.124 --> 06:57.777
- Erm, sorry. I've only got £10.
- That's OK.

06:57.778 --> 06:59.124
I'll pay the rest.

07:00.044 --> 07:02.152
OK. Thank you.

07:02.153 --> 07:04.132
- Great meeting you.
- You too.

07:04.133 --> 07:05.777
I'll just wait for you to get in.

07:05.778 --> 07:07.778
No! No, no. That's fine.

07:08.364 --> 07:09.777
You don't have to do that.

07:09.778 --> 07:12.249
No, no, no, don't be silly.
I'll wait here.

07:16.778 --> 07:18.778
- Goodnight.
- Night.

08:52.932 --> 08:56.931
So, they are selling off
Southwark General Hospital.

08:56.932 --> 08:57.932
- What?
- Getting rid of it.

08:57.933 --> 08:59.471
Turning it into a hotel or something.

08:59.472 --> 09:00.631
You were born there too, right?

09:00.632 --> 09:03.433
- Yeah. God, that's a shame.
- I know.

09:03.434 --> 09:06.057
But you got through OK?
Nobody was suspicious?

09:06.058 --> 09:07.185
Nope.

09:07.186 --> 09:09.363
Imagine they knew you were a cleaner.

09:09.794 --> 09:11.434
So, who was there?

09:12.004 --> 09:14.103
Just Graham and Swanny.

09:14.104 --> 09:15.583
Hey, you all right?

09:15.584 --> 09:17.583
Did you find out anything?

09:17.584 --> 09:19.584
Look, let's er...

09:20.044 --> 09:21.418
Let's not talk here.

09:21.419 --> 09:22.564
Come on.

09:23.584 --> 09:26.623
There are three property firms
bidding for the contract.

09:26.624 --> 09:29.423
One of them is a firm
called Walker Steens.

09:29.424 --> 09:32.162
If they win, their share price
could triple in value.

09:32.163 --> 09:33.583
They're meeting this week to vote on it.

09:33.584 --> 09:35.583
So, when are they going to find out?

09:35.584 --> 09:37.263
They're not.

09:37.264 --> 09:39.423
- We are.
- We are?

09:39.424 --> 09:40.973
What? Why?

09:40.974 --> 09:42.263
Because if we do,

09:42.264 --> 09:45.584
Swanny is going to pay us £30,000.

09:46.584 --> 09:48.190
30,000?

09:48.191 --> 09:49.583
Exactly! And just think.

09:49.584 --> 09:51.330
If we invest that and it triples,

09:51.331 --> 09:52.583
that's 30,000 each.

09:52.584 --> 09:55.027
So we get inside the Health Trust

09:55.028 --> 09:56.583
and bug the meeting room,
is that what you're thinking?

09:56.584 --> 09:58.584
How?

09:59.084 --> 10:00.583
I'm not sure yet.

10:00.584 --> 10:02.338
I haven't figured that bit out.

10:02.339 --> 10:04.584
Speak later. I have to go.

10:06.584 --> 10:08.943
I don't know.

10:08.944 --> 10:10.943
Look, it's one thing
bugging the office here,

10:10.944 --> 10:13.003
but breaking into another building.

10:13.004 --> 10:15.149
What? But I thought we agreed.

10:15.150 --> 10:17.806
This is our way to beat the system
and to pay for your van.

10:17.807 --> 10:19.583
Yeah, but this is like an actual crime.

10:19.584 --> 10:21.584
No, we're not hurting anyone.

10:23.584 --> 10:27.584
Look, I probably should have
told you this before.

10:29.784 --> 10:32.549
But Dave's stopped paying the rent
on the house.

10:33.204 --> 10:34.583
I can't afford it on my own.

10:34.584 --> 10:36.004
What?

10:36.584 --> 10:38.615
Look, I really need this, OK?

10:38.616 --> 10:41.148
30,000 is a life-changing amount
of money for me.

10:41.149 --> 10:42.679
I know it is for you, too.

10:43.124 --> 10:45.124
I don't want to do it without you.

10:47.584 --> 10:48.584
OK.

11:31.829 --> 11:34.583
No, erm, I'm his PA.

11:34.584 --> 11:37.263
He's written that he has a meeting
this week

11:37.264 --> 11:40.583
with the Health Trust to talk about
Southwark General Hospital,

11:40.584 --> 11:44.055
but he hasn't written down when
and I can't get hold of him.

11:44.624 --> 11:46.583
5pm tomorrow.

11:46.584 --> 11:47.584
OK. Perfect.

11:47.585 --> 11:49.303
Thank you so much for your help.

11:49.304 --> 11:50.584
Goodbye.

11:53.584 --> 11:56.272
You know, the largest mushrooms
in the world

11:56.273 --> 11:57.583
are two and a half miles long

11:57.584 --> 11:59.583
and they grow
on the Blue Mountains of Oregon.

11:59.584 --> 12:00.928
It's actually more of a fungus,

12:00.929 --> 12:03.583
but just the thought of it
is enough to turn my stomach.

12:03.584 --> 12:04.623
Why's that?

12:04.624 --> 12:07.583
Yeah, I don't think I told you,
but I've got mycophobia.

12:07.584 --> 12:09.583
It's a morbid fear of mushrooms.

12:09.584 --> 12:13.008
Watching you eat them right now
is actually making my stomach

12:13.009 --> 12:14.584
feel very queasy.

12:30.584 --> 12:33.804
Thought I'd drop this round.
Lily left it at ours.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.583
- Right, well, thanks.
- Actually, Sam,

12:37.584 --> 12:40.584
I wanted to talk to you
about Lily's party.

12:41.044 --> 12:44.583
Beth and me were talking
and she was wondering

12:44.584 --> 12:47.583
if Lily might like to go
to Jump Zero or something this year.

12:47.584 --> 12:48.584
Trampoline park.

12:48.585 --> 12:50.583
We always have a house party
for Lily's birthday.

12:50.584 --> 12:55.583
Yeah, I know, but maybe I and Beth
could take her, some friends...

12:55.584 --> 12:56.783
You can't afford the rent on this place,

12:56.784 --> 12:59.583
but big, fancy parties
at trampoline parks, they're OK?

12:59.584 --> 13:01.584
It's not quite the same, is it?

13:03.584 --> 13:05.783
I'd really like it if you came as well.

13:05.784 --> 13:07.584
Would you?

13:09.284 --> 13:11.103
'Sam!'

13:11.104 --> 13:13.583
Yeah, well, I've got to go, OK?

13:13.584 --> 13:15.584
I'll let you know what she says.

13:32.784 --> 13:34.265
Isn't she one of the cleaners
we interviewed

13:34.266 --> 13:35.512
from the trading floor?

13:35.513 --> 13:37.583
Where did you say you found
this USB stick?

13:37.584 --> 13:39.583
It was on my desk.

13:39.584 --> 13:42.265
She could have left it there
by mistake, I guess.

13:42.266 --> 13:43.583
But she doesn't clean on your floor.

13:43.584 --> 13:46.515
I reckon we speak to that
cleaning supervisor. Hang on.

13:46.516 --> 13:48.583
The CCTV footage you watched,
didn't you say there were cleaners

13:48.584 --> 13:51.820
hanging out outside your room
before the alarm went off?

13:52.004 --> 13:54.104
- Frances?
- What?

13:54.724 --> 13:57.008
Yes. Yeah.

13:57.009 --> 13:58.583
You don't think they set
the alarm off on purpose

13:58.584 --> 13:59.943
so they could get onto the floor?

13:59.944 --> 14:02.583
Erm, listen,
I've got a meeting now with HR.

14:02.584 --> 14:05.244
But I'll see you back here later. OK?

14:37.127 --> 14:38.579
I was talking to your dad earlier.

14:38.580 --> 14:41.038
He was wondering
if you'd like a Jump Zero party

14:41.039 --> 14:42.292
this year for your birthday?

14:42.293 --> 14:44.583
Really? A trampoline party?

14:44.584 --> 14:45.928
Yeah! If that's what you want.

14:45.929 --> 14:47.583
My God, it's going to be so amazing.

14:47.584 --> 14:49.056
Jump Zero will be lots of fun,

14:49.057 --> 14:51.852
but how about we have a little
house party? Like we always do.

14:51.853 --> 14:53.583
No, I'm OK.

14:53.584 --> 14:55.158
You wouldn't want
a big fancy-dress party?

14:55.159 --> 14:56.583
Harry Potter theme maybe?

14:56.584 --> 14:58.044
Well, I'm not sure yet.

14:58.624 --> 15:00.408
How many people can I invite?

15:00.409 --> 15:01.875
As many as you want.

15:01.876 --> 15:04.154
You can dress the house up
with giant spider webs and pumpkins

15:04.155 --> 15:06.021
- and all sorts.
- OK.

15:06.022 --> 15:07.583
That sounds great.

15:07.584 --> 15:09.583
Can I invite Dad and Beth?

15:09.584 --> 15:12.084
Er, yeah! I can ask them.

15:18.264 --> 15:19.583
Mum!

15:19.584 --> 15:21.263
This is Jake.

15:21.264 --> 15:22.623
What's going on here, then?

15:22.624 --> 15:24.333
Hi, Mrs Cook.

15:24.334 --> 15:26.583
Nice to meet you. You must be Lily.

15:26.584 --> 15:28.583
I like your dance costume.

15:28.584 --> 15:30.583
I hope you haven't been sitting
on my sofa like that.

15:30.584 --> 15:32.583
Sorry. I've just finished work...

15:32.584 --> 15:34.583
Er, Jake's just started training
to be a mechanic.

15:34.584 --> 15:36.583
Has he now? Right.

15:36.584 --> 15:37.584
Well, good for you.

15:37.585 --> 15:39.583
Yep.

15:39.584 --> 15:42.263
Anyway, erm, I should go.

15:42.264 --> 15:44.583
I need to get out of these dirty clothes.

15:44.584 --> 15:45.833
Nice to meet you.

15:45.834 --> 15:47.698
Come on, Lily. Let's get
these bags unpacked.

15:47.699 --> 15:48.699
Bye.

15:50.076 --> 15:51.841
'Maybe I'll see you tomorrow?'

15:52.164 --> 15:54.583
Mum? Can I have my sweets?

15:54.584 --> 15:55.944
Mum?

16:04.104 --> 16:05.583
He's nice.

16:05.584 --> 16:06.844
I like him.

16:07.924 --> 16:11.583
- What was he doing here?
- What? Nothing.

16:11.584 --> 16:13.583
Just thought it would be nice
to show him where I lived.

16:13.584 --> 16:15.583
Well, you should ask next time.

16:15.584 --> 16:18.583
I'm sorry, I didn't realise
it would be such a problem.

16:18.584 --> 16:19.584
Isn't it nicer this way?

16:19.585 --> 16:21.783
Rather than me sneaking around,
trying to hide things from you?

16:21.784 --> 16:23.138
Hiding what things?

16:23.139 --> 16:24.583
Nothing.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.761
It's not me who has anything to hide.

16:28.044 --> 16:30.878
By the way, some woman came round
looking for you.

16:30.879 --> 16:31.991
Said she was a friend of yours.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.118
What woman?

16:33.119 --> 16:34.770
She was asking what you're up to now.

16:34.771 --> 16:36.583
Said her name was Frances.

16:36.584 --> 16:38.623
What did you tell her?

16:38.624 --> 16:41.584
That you worked as a cleaner
in Canary Wharf.

16:43.584 --> 16:44.584
What's the problem?

16:44.585 --> 16:47.583
Erm, look, I need to get ready for work.

16:47.584 --> 16:49.526
Can you finish unpacking, please?

16:50.584 --> 16:52.444
What's wrong with Mum?

16:53.584 --> 16:55.583
Nothing. She's fine.

16:55.584 --> 16:58.584
Why don't you help me unpack some things?

17:51.137 --> 17:53.137
We need to talk.

18:02.091 --> 18:05.327
It's been quite a trek
from Dulwich to the Isle of Dogs.

18:07.043 --> 18:08.543
So whose house was it?

18:13.043 --> 18:14.532
I know who you are.

18:14.533 --> 18:15.752
I know you're cleaner. OK?

18:15.753 --> 18:18.165
So let's just get that straight
right now.

18:18.749 --> 18:21.429
- Am I, though? I could be anybody.
- No.

18:21.723 --> 18:24.242
I ran some checks on you with HR
and I know where you live

18:24.243 --> 18:27.042
and I know that you've worked here
for the past five months.

18:27.043 --> 18:31.042
I know you've got two daughters,
Alice and Lily.

18:31.043 --> 18:35.042
You've got a background in dance
and musical theatre.

18:35.043 --> 18:38.042
I know that Alice went roller-skating

18:38.043 --> 18:40.042
for her 13th birthday,
and last year, you got Lily

18:40.043 --> 18:42.043
a disco ball for Christmas.

18:43.450 --> 18:45.450
I know that because I have this.

18:48.576 --> 18:49.776
OK, so what?

18:50.243 --> 18:51.718
Maybe I am a cleaner.

18:51.719 --> 18:54.671
You're a crooked compliance officer
taking backhanders from clients.

18:54.672 --> 18:56.042
Where's your proof?

18:56.043 --> 18:57.383
Why should I tell you?

18:58.043 --> 19:00.303
The listening device. That was you.

19:01.463 --> 19:04.042
That's how I know about you,
Graham and Swanny.

19:04.043 --> 19:06.042
And that's how I was able
to meet with them last night.

19:06.043 --> 19:07.402
You haven't got anything on me.

19:07.403 --> 19:10.042
- And I know you're involved now.
- So what?

19:10.043 --> 19:11.082
You're not going to go to the police

19:11.083 --> 19:13.495
because it wouldn't benefit you to do so.

19:15.043 --> 19:17.338
Neither am I, for the very same reason.

19:18.596 --> 19:20.963
That info on the Health Trust,

19:20.988 --> 19:22.988
you promised to get Swanny,

19:23.043 --> 19:25.042
how would you do that exactly?

19:25.043 --> 19:26.559
Well, the same way I found out about you.

19:26.560 --> 19:29.043
I'm a cleaner. I'm invisible.

19:29.562 --> 19:30.562
OK.

19:31.043 --> 19:33.042
Well, assuming you can do as you say

19:33.043 --> 19:36.042
and assuming that Swanny pays you
for that information,

19:36.043 --> 19:37.082
you'll give me half.

19:37.083 --> 19:39.465
And why would I do that?

19:39.466 --> 19:42.503
Because you need me
to protect you from this.

19:43.043 --> 19:44.596
My colleague John.

19:44.597 --> 19:46.562
He seems to think this is connected

19:46.563 --> 19:48.606
to the fire alarm incident
from the other day.

19:48.607 --> 19:50.779
He thinks the cleaners
triggered it on purpose

19:50.780 --> 19:52.598
to gain access
to the research department.

19:52.599 --> 19:54.284
So, if you want me
to convince him otherwise,

19:54.285 --> 19:56.403
you'll pay me half the finder's fee.

19:57.043 --> 19:58.043
Understood?

20:04.043 --> 20:05.732
Hey. Where have you been?

20:05.733 --> 20:09.042
Erm, I was a little late
leaving the house this morning.

20:09.043 --> 20:10.520
Yeah, well, Viktor's in there with Mina

20:10.521 --> 20:12.707
and he's waiting for you.

20:12.708 --> 20:14.082
Why were these photos found

20:14.083 --> 20:16.043
on a computer in the research department?

20:16.044 --> 20:20.042
Erm, this is really easy
to explain, actually.

20:20.043 --> 20:22.597
You see, Mina was violently ill that day.

20:22.598 --> 20:23.987
Coming out both ends, it was.

20:23.988 --> 20:25.687
Isn't that right?

20:25.688 --> 20:27.333
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:27.334 --> 20:30.042
I mean, she tried to battle on, but...

20:30.043 --> 20:33.402
Well, she got caught a little
short and she... you know.

20:33.403 --> 20:35.412
Yeah, yeah,
I don't need to hear the details.

20:35.413 --> 20:37.079
How did this
get into the research office?

20:37.080 --> 20:40.242
Mina rang me to get her
some clean clothes, you know?

20:40.243 --> 20:42.582
And I was in the area anyway,
getting some photos printed.

20:42.583 --> 20:44.088
That's why I had my USB stick.

20:44.089 --> 20:46.558
I think it's nice to have pictures
hanging on the wall, you know?

20:46.559 --> 20:48.391
Anyway, so I said
I'd finish her shift for her.

20:48.392 --> 20:50.043
I must have left it behind.

20:50.623 --> 20:52.692
I mean, she was so embarrassed
about the whole thing.

20:52.693 --> 20:54.785
That's why I didn't want
to say anything before.

20:54.786 --> 20:56.642
Is it true?

20:56.643 --> 20:58.879
Did you make a mess in your underwear?

21:02.643 --> 21:05.642
- Did you really have to say that?
- What else was I supposed to say?

21:05.643 --> 21:06.943
- Well, what happened?
- Nothing.

21:06.944 --> 21:08.957
- What are you doing?
- Just scanning the mood board.

21:08.958 --> 21:10.497
- For my van.
- Wow!

21:10.498 --> 21:13.254
Well, I thought, you know,
if you're going to get 30,000,

21:13.255 --> 21:14.534
then I should think a little bigger.

21:14.535 --> 21:16.103
Yeah, erm,

21:17.050 --> 21:19.370
about the 30,000.

21:19.643 --> 21:20.682
I spoke to Swanny earlier

21:20.683 --> 21:23.642
and he might have changed his mind
slightly.

21:23.643 --> 21:25.642
He's only going to give us 15 now.

21:25.643 --> 21:27.347
He can't do that.

21:27.348 --> 21:29.111
He thinks it's too much money
for something

21:29.112 --> 21:30.177
that's not a sure thing.

21:30.178 --> 21:32.642
Look, come on.
15 grand is still really good.

21:32.643 --> 21:33.842
If we invest that,

21:33.843 --> 21:36.301
- we're looking at maybe 45.
- Yeah, you're right.

21:36.302 --> 21:38.181
15 grand is still a lot of money.

21:38.182 --> 21:39.417
Where is this meeting?

21:39.418 --> 21:41.642
Yeah, so I spoke
to the Health Trust earlier.

21:41.643 --> 21:44.138
The meeting is happening at five
tomorrow at their offices.

21:44.139 --> 21:45.642
In conference room three.

21:45.643 --> 21:48.401
- OK, so... What's the plan?
- I was thinking

21:48.402 --> 21:50.461
we could turn up sometime
in the afternoon

21:50.462 --> 21:51.642
and say we're the cleaners.

21:51.643 --> 21:54.088
I'm sure they're going to know
who their cleaners are, babe.

21:54.089 --> 21:55.642
Well, they might not.

21:55.643 --> 21:57.614
See, that's the problem with you.
You're always trying to wing it.

21:57.615 --> 22:00.088
- We need to have a proper plan.
- Go on, then.

22:00.089 --> 22:01.642
I don't know.

22:01.643 --> 22:03.642
I think it needs
to be something where, you know,

22:03.643 --> 22:05.642
there'll invite us in because

22:05.643 --> 22:07.642
we're offering some kind of service.

22:07.643 --> 22:09.023
Like what?

22:27.643 --> 22:28.682
Mum, can I talk to you?

22:28.683 --> 22:30.642
I haven't got time right now. I'm sorry.

22:30.643 --> 22:33.642
Me and Jess have got a big job on
and I need to leave.

22:33.643 --> 22:35.114
What you doing with that?

22:36.023 --> 22:37.642
Ladies Night Casino,

22:37.643 --> 22:39.642
Ladies Night Casino, Bet You Can Casino,

22:39.643 --> 22:42.002
Lucky Lina Casino and on and on and on.

22:42.003 --> 22:43.642
Every day for months.

22:43.643 --> 22:46.322
- How did you get on my laptop?
- I know your password.

22:46.323 --> 22:49.642
Mum, I'm only trying to help you.
Jake's uncle's an alcoholic

22:49.643 --> 22:51.642
and he says accepting you have
a problem's one of the first steps

22:51.643 --> 22:54.289
- towards tackling it.
- That's who put you up to this?

22:54.290 --> 22:55.642
Jake told you to go on my laptop?

22:55.643 --> 22:58.169
- No! Of course not.
- I don't have a gambling problem, OK?

22:58.170 --> 22:59.642
I have a little flutter now and again.

22:59.643 --> 23:01.642
I'm certainly not addicted,
if that's what you think?

23:01.643 --> 23:03.006
I just go on when I'm bored.

23:03.007 --> 23:05.596
Mum, sometimes you go on
over 30 times a day.

23:05.863 --> 23:07.642
And betting on the stock market
as well now.

23:07.643 --> 23:09.642
That's what it looks like anyway.

23:09.643 --> 23:10.843
And so what?

23:12.239 --> 23:13.642
OK. Maybe you're right.

23:13.643 --> 23:16.322
Just a harmless hobby.
Something you do to kill time.

23:16.323 --> 23:17.642
Yeah, that's right.

23:17.643 --> 23:20.178
The cleaning isn't very fulfilling
and this is like a distraction.

23:20.179 --> 23:21.266
Yeah.

23:21.291 --> 23:22.938
That's how a lot of women start gambling.

23:22.939 --> 23:24.642
I'll get it!

23:24.643 --> 23:27.642
They do it because it's escaping
from the stress of their own lives.

23:27.643 --> 23:30.076
- Jess!
- Little Lily pad!

23:33.683 --> 23:35.642
- Where's Glynn with the car?
- He's not back yet,

23:35.643 --> 23:38.526
but he'll be here any minute.
Can we wait outside?

23:38.728 --> 23:39.799
Yeah, sure.

23:39.800 --> 23:42.046
Where you going?
I thought it was your night off.

23:42.047 --> 23:43.854
It was...

23:43.855 --> 23:46.642
but I have to work now, darling.
I'm sorry. Come here.

23:46.643 --> 23:48.938
You be a good girl for your sister. OK?

23:51.252 --> 23:52.642
Mum.

23:52.643 --> 23:54.017
I'd really like it

23:54.018 --> 23:55.430
if we went to a group.

23:55.431 --> 23:57.483
One where family members can go, too.

23:57.484 --> 24:00.642
It might be a waste of time,
but can we do it for me?

24:00.643 --> 24:03.112
Look, darling, I don't need to go.

24:03.113 --> 24:06.642
But if it will stop this nonsense
and make you happy, then, maybe.

24:06.643 --> 24:08.702
There's one on Friday at 6 o'clock.

24:09.383 --> 24:10.643
OK.

24:12.849 --> 24:14.303
I love you.

24:16.643 --> 24:18.642
Where the hell is he?

24:20.643 --> 24:23.642
Here he comes. Come on!

24:31.483 --> 24:33.205
- Hey, Jess.
- Yeah, hey, Glynn.

24:33.206 --> 24:35.642
Where have you been? We were
supposed to leave half an hour ago.

24:35.643 --> 24:36.643
Sorry.

24:36.644 --> 24:38.642
I had to speak to my tutor and then...

24:38.643 --> 24:40.642
Well, I went to Nando's. Sorry.

24:40.643 --> 24:42.930
OK.

24:42.931 --> 24:45.344
Well, I've got to run.

24:45.345 --> 24:47.875
I'll make sure I bring it back
in one piece.

24:56.643 --> 24:59.162
It's gone five.
Hasn't the meeting started already?

24:59.163 --> 25:00.703
Let's hope not.

25:03.163 --> 25:05.102
How we getting in?

25:05.103 --> 25:06.743
Go home, finished.

25:09.843 --> 25:12.642
- Try one, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four?

25:39.336 --> 25:40.642
Can I help you, ladies?

25:40.643 --> 25:42.482
Well, she's certainly a beast.

25:42.483 --> 25:44.162
Surprised you girls
ain't done your backs in,

25:44.163 --> 25:45.642
lugging this around all day.

25:45.643 --> 25:46.643
Well, we're stronger than we look.

25:46.644 --> 25:48.642
And we should probably get going.

25:48.643 --> 25:50.002
Maybe we could start in the main office.

25:50.003 --> 25:51.642
What do you mean?

25:51.643 --> 25:53.642
That's why we're here.
To polish the marble flooring.

25:53.643 --> 25:57.642
But there ain't any marble floors
in the main offices.

25:57.643 --> 25:58.643
Just here.

25:58.644 --> 26:00.642
Well, guess we'll do out here, then.

26:00.643 --> 26:01.683
Great.

26:02.383 --> 26:04.842
Look, I'm interested to see
this thing in action.

26:04.843 --> 26:06.643
Er, yeah.

26:07.063 --> 26:08.642
Do you know? I just remembered.

26:08.643 --> 26:10.642
I forgot to bring an extension cable.

26:10.643 --> 26:13.643
You don't have a spare one,
do you, please?

26:14.143 --> 26:15.642
No problem.

26:15.643 --> 26:17.189
I'll be back in a minute.

26:17.190 --> 26:18.643
Thank you!

26:22.643 --> 26:24.642
Sam, what are you doing?

26:24.643 --> 26:26.291
I'm going to go find the meeting room.

26:26.292 --> 26:29.116
When he comes back,
just say I needed the toilet.

26:38.643 --> 26:40.643
No.

26:46.643 --> 26:48.483
Shit.

26:50.643 --> 26:52.642
There.

26:52.643 --> 26:54.323
- Can I?
- No.

26:56.507 --> 26:59.026
Here you go. Here's one extension cable.

26:59.027 --> 27:00.643
Thank you.

27:01.103 --> 27:03.045
Wasn't there three of you before?

27:04.063 --> 27:05.643
Toilet.

27:26.643 --> 27:28.643
Shit.

27:35.323 --> 27:38.112
- Erm, was this the hospital meeting?
- Er, yeah.

27:38.113 --> 27:40.642
- Do you know what they said?
- No.

27:40.643 --> 27:42.642
How would I know?

28:05.163 --> 28:07.642
- You all right there?
- Erm, yeah, sorry.

28:07.643 --> 28:11.642
- Didn't know where I was.
- All right, well, come on, then.

28:11.643 --> 28:13.643
Yes, thanks.

28:19.323 --> 28:20.900
So, you're just in there, yeah?

28:20.901 --> 28:22.667
- Thanks.
- All right.

28:32.643 --> 28:34.482
- Did you do it?
- Were we too late?

28:34.483 --> 28:36.642
No. We weren't too late.

28:36.643 --> 28:38.642
- Did you get your phone in there?
- No, I didn't need to.

28:38.643 --> 28:40.187
I could hear them talking
from outside the room.

28:40.188 --> 28:42.642
Really? So... what's happening?

28:42.643 --> 28:46.173
Who's getting planning permission?
Is it Walker Steens, yeah?

28:46.343 --> 28:48.642
Yeah. It's them.

28:48.643 --> 28:50.103
We're on!

29:39.683 --> 29:41.643
How about this one?

29:41.943 --> 29:43.682
What? It's the best I can do.

29:43.683 --> 29:45.642
We have to hurry up
if we want to get this done

29:45.643 --> 29:47.879
before the Gamblers Anonymous meeting.

29:48.884 --> 29:52.783
I need to, erm, pop out
for a little while.

29:53.118 --> 29:55.042
We have to be at the Community
Centre at six.

29:55.043 --> 29:57.642
Yeah... Well, I'll tell you what.
Glynn can watch Lily

29:57.643 --> 29:59.127
and I'll meet you there. OK?

29:59.128 --> 30:00.463
Mum!

30:52.643 --> 30:54.643
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:55.452 --> 30:56.524
Where have you been?

30:56.525 --> 30:58.157
I've been waiting here
for, like, half an hour.

30:58.158 --> 31:00.003
Have you got an answer?

31:07.163 --> 31:08.903
How did you get this?

31:09.136 --> 31:10.863
I can't reveal my sources.

31:18.643 --> 31:20.643
I could only get 15,000.

31:21.543 --> 31:22.543
What?

31:22.643 --> 31:24.002
Yeah, I'm sorry to spring this on you

31:24.003 --> 31:26.322
but circumstances have changed.

31:26.323 --> 31:28.107
I do hope it's not going to be a problem.

31:28.108 --> 31:30.520
Well, it doesn't look very good, does it?

31:30.643 --> 31:32.078
No, it doesn't.

31:32.079 --> 31:34.643
Please extend my sincerest apologies.

31:35.183 --> 31:38.007
I'm sure someone like you
can smooth things over.

31:38.223 --> 31:39.642
I'll see what I can do.

31:39.643 --> 31:40.943
Thank you.

31:42.423 --> 31:44.163
I'll be in touch.

32:13.003 --> 32:15.642
Look, I'm really sorry, OK?
I really wanted to go.

32:15.643 --> 32:17.682
I had a job on this evening
that I'd forgotten about.

32:17.683 --> 32:19.465
Lily! Sorry.

32:20.970 --> 32:22.339
Go and get the dustpan and brush, please.

32:22.340 --> 32:24.046
I think it's in Glynn's room.

32:24.297 --> 32:27.003
I'll go to the next one, though,
I promise. OK?

32:27.223 --> 32:30.341
Did you get that happy birthday sign
finished earlier?

32:32.070 --> 32:35.483
Alice!

33:03.369 --> 33:05.369
Mum.

33:05.643 --> 33:07.327
Hey. No!

33:07.328 --> 33:09.081
I'm not clearing it up.

33:09.082 --> 33:11.257
I do enough of that at work, come on.

33:11.258 --> 33:13.223
It's your mess.

33:26.369 --> 33:28.383
I'll get it!

33:32.616 --> 33:35.616
Hello, love! Here we are!

33:36.666 --> 33:38.666
- Not late, are we?
- No!

33:42.236 --> 33:44.235
Mary, I can't believe
you're up and about.

33:44.236 --> 33:45.848
- You look great!
- Thanks, love.

33:45.849 --> 33:49.235
- Where's the birthday girl?
- Well, I think she's...

33:49.236 --> 33:51.236
- There she is!
- There she is!

33:53.703 --> 33:56.703
- Are you excited about your party?
- Yeah!

33:56.728 --> 33:57.768
Come here, you.

33:57.793 --> 33:59.953
Look at this place!

34:00.302 --> 34:03.435
Your mum's spoilt you again!

34:03.460 --> 34:06.235
Did she get you something
for being a clever girl at school?

34:06.236 --> 34:09.235
Yeah, a troll doll.

34:09.235 --> 34:11.235
Right!

34:12.297 --> 34:15.235
Well, here's a little something
for your birthday.

34:15.235 --> 34:18.873
Your dad says he'll pay that
into your savings account for me.

34:18.875 --> 34:20.649
- What do you say, darling?
- Thank you.

34:20.650 --> 34:23.235
Here, Lily.
Beth's got you summat as well.

34:23.235 --> 34:25.235
Here you go.

34:34.376 --> 34:36.020
I hope you don't already have that book.

34:36.021 --> 34:38.039
It's got some really great artists
and painters in there.

34:38.040 --> 34:40.906
Maybe we can look through it
together sometime.

34:41.235 --> 34:44.235
Thank you. Mum, look!

34:44.235 --> 34:46.822
Wow! That's nice, isn't it?

34:48.203 --> 34:51.203
OK, we excited?

34:51.228 --> 34:53.228
Are you ready?

34:53.253 --> 34:55.929
- What's it supposed to be?
- I've no idea.

34:55.955 --> 34:57.565
Mary, darling,
there should be a broom handle

34:57.566 --> 34:58.680
behind your chair there.

34:58.681 --> 35:01.328
Have I sat on it? No, there it is!

35:02.056 --> 35:04.639
Do you think that's a good idea,
to get Lily waving that around

35:04.640 --> 35:05.707
while she's blindfolded?

35:05.708 --> 35:07.595
She'll be all right.

35:07.596 --> 35:09.995
OK, come on, then. We're all going
to help. On the count of three!

35:09.996 --> 35:12.115
- You ready, Lily?
- Mum. Mum!

35:12.116 --> 35:14.901
There's a man called Wonder Wizard
on the phone.

35:15.523 --> 35:18.935
- It's all right. I've got this.
- OK, be careful, you lot!

35:19.596 --> 35:21.595
Thanks, darling.

35:21.596 --> 35:23.436
Hello?

35:24.547 --> 35:26.595
No, no. You've got to be kidding me.

35:26.596 --> 35:31.383
You can't cancel at the last minute
on a nine-year-old girl.

35:31.523 --> 35:33.523
What am I supposed to do now?

35:33.596 --> 35:36.118
I've got you that money.
I'll give it to you later.

35:36.119 --> 35:38.595
Well, that's absolutely no use
to me now, is it?

35:38.596 --> 35:41.137
OK, whatever. Bye-bye.

35:41.138 --> 35:43.727
- What's wrong?
- Magician's cancelled on me.

35:44.463 --> 35:46.463
Is there anyone else you can call?

35:48.727 --> 35:50.596
- Glynn?
- Come in.

35:51.259 --> 35:54.612
Sorry to disturb you,
but I need your help with something.

35:55.122 --> 35:56.807
First of all, and I probably should have

35:56.808 --> 35:58.081
said something about this before,

35:58.082 --> 35:59.595
but my husband's downstairs

35:59.596 --> 36:02.435
and he doesn't know anything
about you living here.

36:02.436 --> 36:05.787
You're not supposed to be...
It's complicated.

36:05.788 --> 36:08.587
So, if I see him,
then why should I say I'm here?

36:08.588 --> 36:10.941
Well, that brings me to my second point.

36:11.158 --> 36:13.217
My magician's just cancelled on me.

36:13.303 --> 36:16.186
And I wondered if you knew
any of your old tricks.

36:16.423 --> 36:18.769
Well, just a few.

36:18.770 --> 36:20.990
It's just... Lily was so excited.

36:22.436 --> 36:23.642
OK.

36:23.643 --> 36:26.521
Great! Thank you!
You're a life-saver!

36:26.522 --> 36:30.623
We just need to dress you up
a little bit.

36:44.796 --> 36:48.595
I wonder who that could be!

36:48.596 --> 36:51.070
Afternoon, Sam.

36:51.071 --> 36:53.264
We're just here to collect
a few of your things.

36:53.265 --> 36:54.471
No.

36:56.315 --> 36:57.913
I told you this would happen.

36:57.914 --> 36:59.595
Now, you need to let us in
so that we can do our job.

36:59.596 --> 37:02.725
I'm right in the middle
of my daughter's birthday party.

37:02.726 --> 37:04.218
- Please.
- Bad timing, I guess.

37:04.219 --> 37:06.140
But we're coming in, unless you want
us to call the police.

37:06.141 --> 37:08.363
- No, please don't do this.
- Sorry.

37:08.476 --> 37:09.476
No, wait, wait!

37:09.477 --> 37:11.929
Wait, I've got some money I can give you.

37:11.930 --> 37:15.460
If you just send your people away,
I'll bring it out. Please.

37:15.463 --> 37:17.543
I'll be right back.

37:23.476 --> 37:26.476
Sam. There's juice spilt on the carpet.

37:27.129 --> 37:29.129
Here. There you go.

37:33.516 --> 37:36.475
- Where's this money?
- I told you to wait outside.

37:36.476 --> 37:39.475
Look, there's five grand there, OK?

37:39.476 --> 37:41.835
You happy now?
Please, just leave me in peace.

37:41.836 --> 37:43.475
You still owe me 12.

37:43.476 --> 37:47.006
Have a think about how you're
going to sort that out. Lively.

37:49.476 --> 37:51.475
Should be fine.

37:51.476 --> 37:52.476
Who was that?

37:52.477 --> 37:55.475
Just one of the dads from school.

37:55.476 --> 37:57.359
Dropping off a present for Lily.

38:07.476 --> 38:09.475
OK, Lily, I want you to take
these marbles

38:09.476 --> 38:11.475
and drop them in
on the count of three, OK?

38:11.476 --> 38:13.475
One, two, three, drop.

38:13.476 --> 38:16.475
Shake them around. Say the magic word.

38:16.476 --> 38:18.995
- Alakazeembra.
- Alakazeembra!

38:18.996 --> 38:21.155
Wow!

38:22.476 --> 38:25.475
Where are the marbles? Where did they go?

38:25.476 --> 38:27.835
Behind Lily's ear! There we go!

38:31.476 --> 38:33.676
Mum. Are you OK?

38:34.543 --> 38:36.475
Is it about yesterday?

38:36.476 --> 38:38.475
Not going to the group?

38:38.476 --> 38:40.675
It's OK if you got scared.

38:40.676 --> 38:43.996
I guess it's a big step
to do something like that.

38:45.476 --> 38:47.476
I'm so proud of you.

38:48.476 --> 38:50.476
I hope you know that.

38:53.836 --> 38:57.475
- Should we go back in?
- Come on, then.

39:11.476 --> 39:14.985
Er, sorry, Glynn.
Didn't realise you were in here.

39:14.986 --> 39:17.621
I'm just having trouble with this beard.

39:17.622 --> 39:19.503
Well, let me see.

39:19.883 --> 39:20.883
It's just there.

39:21.476 --> 39:24.475
Yeah, that is stuck on pretty tight.

39:24.476 --> 39:26.996
Why don't you take a seat?

39:29.476 --> 39:31.475
Maybe if we just pull it slowly?

39:33.052 --> 39:35.078
Mum, we're going now.

39:35.079 --> 39:38.475
You can't go out like that,
with all chocolate round your mouth.

39:38.476 --> 39:40.475
Come here!

39:40.476 --> 39:43.475
You have a good time.
Thanks for my party.

39:43.476 --> 39:45.973
Did you enjoy it, yeah? I'm so happy.

39:45.974 --> 39:48.186
Now, you have a good time, you hear?

39:48.187 --> 39:49.906
Be careful on those trampolines, though.

39:49.907 --> 39:51.315
See you later.

39:51.316 --> 39:52.475
Love you.

39:52.476 --> 39:54.156
See you in the car, yeah?

39:54.663 --> 39:55.835
Come on, guys.

39:55.836 --> 39:57.475
Sure you don't want to come?

39:57.476 --> 39:59.515
No, it's OK.

39:59.516 --> 40:01.475
I've got to clear all this up.

40:01.476 --> 40:03.475
By the way,

40:03.476 --> 40:07.065
I was working on some one-bedroom
flats just round the corner.

40:07.316 --> 40:08.703
It'd be ideal for...

40:09.823 --> 40:11.476
you know, when...

40:11.743 --> 40:13.743
What would I need one of them for?

40:13.823 --> 40:16.706
I'm staying right where I am,
thank you very much.

40:19.476 --> 40:22.475
Right. We'll, er, we'll drop her off
around seven, yeah?

40:22.476 --> 40:23.783
Yeah.

40:28.476 --> 40:30.675
Sam told me that you're saving
to buy a van.

40:30.676 --> 40:32.475
It's going to take a while.

40:32.476 --> 40:35.475
The conversion costs
are a lot more than I thought.

40:36.676 --> 40:38.475
Well, you know, er,

40:38.476 --> 40:41.475
if you wanted,
I could help you find a van,

40:41.476 --> 40:44.475
maybe even convert it for you?

40:44.476 --> 40:46.186
Seriously?

40:46.187 --> 40:47.675
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:47.676 --> 40:50.515
I'm good with electrics,
welding, bits of plumbing.

40:50.516 --> 40:52.475
I wouldn't charge you, of course.

40:52.476 --> 40:54.835
You just need to get
the bits and pieces together

40:54.836 --> 40:56.476
and I can do the rest.

40:58.476 --> 40:59.476
Yeah.

40:59.477 --> 41:01.475
Thank you.

41:01.476 --> 41:03.475
That would actually be amazing.

41:03.476 --> 41:05.516
Great.

41:08.476 --> 41:10.475
- Where should we put these?
- Just leave them there.

41:10.476 --> 41:13.475
I'll take them out in a bit.

41:13.476 --> 41:15.475
- Has everyone gone?
- Yeah.

41:15.476 --> 41:18.155
So... where's the money?

41:28.476 --> 41:31.156
- Where's yours?
- Upstairs.

41:34.043 --> 41:36.962
We should invest this in
Walker Steens as soon as possible.

41:36.963 --> 41:38.475
I'm going to set up a separate account.

41:38.476 --> 41:40.515
- Mina, you should do the same.
- Maybe you should just use it

41:40.516 --> 41:42.475
for things you want.
Like your van and what not?

41:42.476 --> 41:45.475
You said we could triple our money
if the deal goes through.

41:45.476 --> 41:47.475
- If the deal gets announced.
- What do you mean if?

41:47.476 --> 41:49.475
- You said you heard them.
- I did, yeah.

41:49.476 --> 41:52.475
- But, I mean, things could change.
- Why would they change?

41:52.476 --> 41:55.476
No, no, you're right.
Everything's going to be fine.

41:58.476 --> 42:00.475
Hey.

42:00.476 --> 42:04.475
So, I've just been talking with Max
from IT about that USB incident.

42:04.476 --> 42:05.476
What? What for?

42:06.183 --> 42:07.475
I didn't tell you to do that.

42:07.476 --> 42:09.515
Well, no, but I thought
with that fire alarm, you know?

42:09.516 --> 42:11.555
Maybe there was a data
breach, something like that.

42:11.556 --> 42:12.476
And?

42:12.477 --> 42:14.911
He checked the logs from
when the fire alarm was activated.

42:14.912 --> 42:16.475
Someone went back into the office,

42:16.476 --> 42:19.300
printed out Christine's
entire research document.

42:19.476 --> 42:23.182
Maybe we should have another chat
with that cleaning supervisor.

42:29.869 --> 42:30.869
Hey, babe.

42:35.242 --> 42:36.442
You all right?

42:37.476 --> 42:38.476
Yeah.

42:38.477 --> 42:40.475
Hey, so listen.

42:40.476 --> 42:43.155
I was just chatting with, er, Pete.

42:43.156 --> 42:44.475
From down the pub.

42:44.476 --> 42:47.475
And he said he'd sell me his van
for 1,500 quid.

42:47.476 --> 42:50.995
But he needs some money, cash in hand.

42:50.996 --> 42:52.702
So, I was thinking, you know,

42:53.476 --> 42:55.475
maybe you could transfer me the money

42:55.476 --> 42:57.476
from your savings.

43:00.142 --> 43:02.142
This could be good for us.

43:03.082 --> 43:05.082
No.

43:06.476 --> 43:09.086
You're not still thinking
about that coffee shop on wheels?

43:09.087 --> 43:10.832
Yeah.

43:10.833 --> 43:14.676
It's my money and I'm going to do
whatever I want with it.

43:47.516 --> 43:49.515
Spin again.

44:27.476 --> 44:30.475
Jess! Jess, babe!

44:30.476 --> 44:32.823
It's been announced! It's Walker Steen!

44:34.476 --> 44:36.155
God!

44:36.156 --> 44:38.475
- So, how much have we made?
- I don't know. The market's closed.

44:38.476 --> 44:40.995
We'll have to wait and see
in the morning, but it's happened.

44:40.996 --> 44:42.475
- I can't believe it.
- I know, neither can I!

44:42.476 --> 44:43.476
Even though you heard it

44:43.477 --> 44:44.769
and we knew it was going to happen!

44:44.770 --> 44:47.475
- Yeah.
- I still can't believe it!

45:07.476 --> 45:09.475
Hey, Viktor.

45:09.476 --> 45:12.475
Did you do something different
with your hair?

45:12.476 --> 45:14.475
It looks good.

45:14.476 --> 45:17.475
Compliance thinks Sam Cook
bring documents in this department

45:17.476 --> 45:19.476
and you help her.

45:21.476 --> 45:23.476
You will tell me what you know.

45:23.903 --> 45:25.476
Or you will be out.
