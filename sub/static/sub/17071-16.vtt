I don't know
what else to do!

I've got
a less violent plan.

Carol-Joan, I love your shirt.
Are those horses?

17:55.142 --> 17:57.744
Yes.
Wild ones.

[ Whispering ]
This is going perfectly.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.218
Initiate phase two.

18:05.252 --> 18:07.454
Uh, so, what game
should we play first?

18:07.487 --> 18:09.989
How about charades?
I love charades.

18:10.022 --> 18:12.325
That could be fun.
Charades it is.

18:12.359 --> 18:14.261
Couple teams.

there?

That famous scene

18:53.200 --> 18:56.135
when John Dunbar and Two Socks
romp together,

18:56.169 --> 18:58.471
causing the Sioux
to name him...

[ Chuckles ] Of course.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.719
I totally
should've gotten that.

It was a really good Two Socks
impression.

Hmm.

Deidre: Okay. Well,
Richard and I will go next.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.730
CJ,
if you're keeping time,

19:23.763 --> 19:25.665
can you make sure and give us
the extra 10 seconds

19:25.698 --> 19:26.699
that Richard gave Jessica?

19:26.733 --> 19:29.168

not an hourglass.

Oh, look who's suddenly
Mother Time.

I wish you had
that attitude

ice-cream cones.

Drip, drip, drip
all over my Volvo.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.413
I do not have ice cream.
Oh, please.

19:40.447 --> 19:41.748
I don't eat ice cream.
I have frozen yogurt.
No, for "Dances With Wolves,"
you should've used that

19:41.781 --> 19:43.082
tomahawk-chop gesture.

19:43.115 --> 19:46.319
Ooh. N-No. Marvin,
we've talked about this.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.421
That gesture might not seem
like a big deal

19:48.455 --> 19:49.889
to people
of your generation,

19:49.922 --> 19:52.359
but it is offensive
to Native Americans.

19:52.392 --> 19:55.228
I've asked you never to use
that term "my generation."

19:55.262 --> 19:57.530
It's offensive
to "me-Americans."

19:57.564 --> 19:59.732
Okay, but
if you're gonna say it...
Why would you tell them
that I eat ice cream?

19:59.766 --> 20:01.434
I don't eat ice cream.
I'm just asking you
not to use it.

20:01.468 --> 20:03.035
Why is that the focus?

wedge from behind the credenza.

each other right in front of us.

Carol-Joan telling us

in pandas?

I get now
why you were upset

20:22.455 --> 20:24.724
that I complained to Honey
about you.
