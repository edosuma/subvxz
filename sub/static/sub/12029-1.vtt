I don't know what you're talking about

30:04.849 --> 30:07.757

31:03.227 --> 31:06.951
They gave me a shot.
They save my life

31:08.034 --> 31:10.677
Why would they do that?
I do not understand

31:10.678 --> 31:11.338
Look

31:12.952 --> 31:15.283
if we going to find out
what's going on here

31:15.284 --> 31:17.225
I want to know
everything you know

31:18.135 --> 31:21.586
All I know is that this is something
to do about Roulette

31:26.186 --> 31:28.286
What do you know about that?

31:29.590 --> 31:30.700
I know its an underground bunker with

the President and Vice President
and National Security Adviser are all

31:33.957 --> 31:35.960
taken if there ever were
an attack on Washington

31:35.960 --> 31:38.238
after 9/11 they built
a series of bunkers

31:38.238 --> 31:40.501
Go to the bunkers changes
randomly without notices

31:40.501 --> 31:44.716
Only a hand full of people ever know
which one of this on an any given day

31:44.716 --> 31:46.458
That's why they call them Roulette

31:47.392 --> 31:48.781
How do you know that?

31:49.485 --> 31:52.695
I told you earlier I'm with the
State Department Jeremy

31:52.695 --> 31:56.278
- No, you never mention that to me
- Yes, I did

31:56.278 --> 31:58.363
I assigned the National Security
Council at the center of operations

31:58.363 --> 32:00.334
I worked in the White House

at the United Nations

32:01.541 --> 32:03.952

32:18.981 --> 32:21.473
Brian Nolan replaced him in the
center of operations two years ago

32:21.473 --> 32:24.639
Dave Lau went to the Pentagon,
the Minister of Defense office

32:27.146 --> 32:29.206

the operations center

32:29.206 --> 32:31.770
I want to know what painting
hanging on in the conference room

32:33.235 --> 32:34.642
That's a trick question

32:34.642 --> 32:36.795
There are no paintings there

32:36.795 --> 32:39.987

32:45.910 --> 32:48.188
best thing you can is be quiet

32:50.369 --> 32:53.081
They know where my family lives

32:53.081 --> 32:55.475
Do you think that I'm going to lay
here and fucking give up? No way

32:55.475 --> 32:57.067
Look I'm not going to do that

32:57.068 --> 32:59.264
Yes you are.
Because that is your duty

32:59.264 --> 33:01.084
Your duty is to keep your mouth shut

33:02.474 --> 33:04.436
When you joined the State,
you took an oath

33:05.760 --> 33:07.580
Don't forget that

33:13.922 --> 33:15.742
Do you have any kids, Jeremy?

33:20.525 --> 33:25.112
No. No I don't... we are

33:45.383 --> 33:47.483
I was just trying to make
things right between us

33:48.470 --> 33:51.170
That's why I was in New York.
That's why I went there

33:51.170 --> 33:54.581
to set things straight with this
guy who I owed money to

33:57.694 --> 33:59.514
How many kids you got, Henry?

34:01.559 --> 34:05.225
I have two, 7 and 9, boys

34:05.225 --> 34:06.544

weeks to Disney World

34:08.440 --> 34:10.056

34:10.056 --> 34:12.792
I can't stand roller-coasters

34:12.792 --> 34:15.081

2 big boom right near the road

52:49.030 --> 52:51.916
I thought it was an
earthquake of something

52:51.916 --> 52:55.179
When I looked over it was a smoke cloud

52:55.179 --> 52:56.759

55:07.264 --> 55:09.132
One just detonated outside of Langley

55:09.132 --> 55:12.479
Jeremy, I have to go. We're last ones
in the building, we're evacuating

55:12.479 --> 55:13.958
We could hit next

55:13.958 --> 55:15.971
Whoa

55:15.971 --> 55:19.086
Detonated?
What're you talking about?

55:20.142 --> 55:24.537
Bombs, car bombs
and you're lying inside one

55:25.872 --> 55:28.772
I'm sorry, Jeremy. I have to go
I call you back at this number

55:28.772 --> 55:31.958
Hey, Ben I need your cell

55:42.404 --> 55:45.143
Ben. I need your cell.
Hello?

55:45.143 --> 55:46.263
Jeremy

55:46.913 --> 55:48.033
Molly?

55:48.033 --> 55:50.589
Oh my God I'm in a trunk of a car

55:50.589 --> 55:52.323
- it's moving
- What?

55:52.323 --> 55:57.148
- I can't get out
- What? No, no, no, no. Fuck

55:57.148 --> 55:58.007
I'm so scared

55:58.008 --> 56:00.717
Tell me where you are.
What's going on?

56:00.717 --> 56:05.607
I'm in a car, and it's moving
and don't know what to do

56:06.446 --> 56:10.173
- Alright. Just stay with me, alright
- Okay

56:10.173 --> 56:14.234
I'm here, I'm here. Let think with
each other for a minute, okay?

56:14.235 --> 56:15.249
Okay

56:15.249 --> 56:17.039
Did you see who put you in the car?

56:18.034 --> 56:21.005
I don't know. It's happen so fast

56:21.005 --> 56:25.273
Okay, alright. I need you to stay calm
alright babe? We need to think

56:25.954 --> 56:28.500
Stay calm, just try to relax, okay?

56:30.515 --> 56:33.501
Why is this happening to us?
What do they want?

56:33.501 --> 56:35.468
This all part of the terrorist attack

56:36.373 --> 56:39.020
They want information
about The President Bunker

56:39.020 --> 56:41.149
I got the information
they're trying to get out of it

56:41.149 --> 56:44.574
Oh my God this can't be happening

56:47.398 --> 56:49.589
- Jeremy
- Listen to me, Molly

56:50.725 --> 56:54.800
- Molly, can you hear me
- Yes

56:54.800 --> 56:59.380
- Jeremy, I'm so scared
- I know, I know

56:59.380 --> 57:01.762
I'm going to get you out of there I'm
going to get you out in one piece.

57:01.763 --> 57:02.357
I promise you

57:03.721 --> 57:07.991
- You believe me?
- Yes

57:08.901 --> 57:11.246
Listen, there's something
I want to tell you

57:13.215 --> 57:16.015
Something I been meaning
to tell you for a long time

57:21.862 --> 57:23.702
I'm sorry

57:26.219 --> 57:27.339
I'm sorry

57:29.879 --> 57:31.979
For anything I did with Morgan

57:33.797 --> 57:35.584

57:38.072 --> 57:40.081
and for let you down honey

57:42.372 --> 57:43.772
I'm sorry

Thank you, thank you

59:09.483 --> 59:13.607

59:22.886 --> 59:26.161
- Who's this?
- I'm looking for a Mrs Shaw

59:26.161 --> 59:28.305

59:51.498 --> 59:53.598

Agent Raines

59:53.598 --> 59:55.559
Give us the location
of Roulette,

59:55.560 --> 59:58.213
or I start executing
these people, one by one

59:58.213 --> 01:00:00.245
Tell me, now

01:00:05.703 --> 01:00:07.132
No

01:00:17.561 --> 01:00:19.017

01:00:19.017 --> 01:00:22.255
Jeremy, help
Help me, something's happening

01:00:22.255 --> 01:00:23.512
What's going on, Henry?
What's wrong?

01:00:23.512 --> 01:00:26.288
Jeremy, the trunk is filled
with some kind of liquid.

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:27.492
I don't know what it is

01:00:28.936 --> 01:00:30.056
Liquid? What?

01:00:31.843 --> 01:00:36.719
Just keep talking to me, Henry
Just don't stop, keep talking to me

01:00:36.719 --> 01:00:39.874
Jeremy, it's filling
I-I think I'm gonna drown

01:00:39.874 --> 01:00:42.417
There is no time left
on the clock

01:00:42.417 --> 01:00:46.460
What's going happen to me, Jeremy?
Are they really going to let me drawn

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:50.301
Jeremy, please.
Give them what they want

01:00:50.301 --> 01:00:54.479
This is my life, man
Just tell them.

01:00:58.382 --> 01:01:00.202
I'm sorry, Henry

01:01:03.067 --> 01:01:05.167
But I can't do that

01:01:08.377 --> 01:01:10.197
I'm so sorry

01:01:18.556 --> 01:01:21.847
Our Father lord of heaven
hallowed be by name

01:01:21.847 --> 01:01:25.431
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be
done on earth as in the sky

01:01:25.431 --> 01:01:28.216
Give us today our daily bread
and forgive us for trespasses

01:01:28.216 --> 01:01:30.776
We forgive those trespass against us

01:01:30.776 --> 01:01:33.879
lead us not into temptation...
but deliver us from evil

01:01:55.311 --> 01:01:58.154
Henry?
Henry, are still with me?

01:01:59.413 --> 01:02:02.184
Henry.
Fuck!

01:02:18.081 --> 01:02:21.115
We are experiencing an
unusually high call volume

01:02:21.115 --> 01:02:23.860
- Please try call again later
- Shit

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.118
This is not a test

01:02:38.118 --> 01:02:40.969
The state and federal
authorities has

01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:44.121
activated the Emergency
Broadcast System

01:02:44.121 --> 01:02:46.314
Please do not use your telephone

01:02:46.314 --> 01:02:50.094
Stay tuned to this station for
news and official information

01:02:50.094 --> 01:02:53.339
I repeat this is not a test

01:02:53.898 --> 01:02:56.679
we are standing by for an announcement
from The President with

01:02:56.679 --> 01:02:59.105
the additional bombing at
Andrews Air Force Base and

01:02:59.105 --> 01:03:03.469
other locations around the capital
it is clear, we are under attacked

01:03:03.469 --> 01:03:06.562
The President and first family
has been taken to a secure location

01:03:06.562 --> 01:03:08.661
Air Force One touch down at
Andrews Air Force Base

01:03:08.661 --> 01:03:11.466
just minutes before the
three bombs exploded there

01:03:11.466 --> 01:03:14.444
Smoke can now be seen from
miles all around Washington

01:03:14.444 --> 01:03:16.599
and more explosions
may be imminent

01:03:16.599 --> 01:03:18.835
Please, stay off the
highways and roads

01:03:18.836 --> 01:03:21.015
emergency vehicles
need to get through

01:03:21.015 --> 01:03:24.342
Stay in your home. We're waiting
for the president address

01:03:24.342 --> 01:03:27.266
as soon as that happens
we will go directly to it

01:03:27.266 --> 01:03:30.398
Right now though, lets go to
Susan Gibbs in the capital

01:03:30.398 --> 01:03:33.181
and Susan, you've got a front row
seat to see what's going on there

01:03:33.181 --> 01:03:35.240
as long as....street

01:03:36.766 --> 01:03:39.837
- Hello?
- Jeremy, It's Ben. You there?

01:03:39.837 --> 01:03:44.743
Ben. Ben, what do you know?
What's going on?

01:03:44.743 --> 01:03:46.632
Car bombs are going off
all over the district, if we can't

01:03:46.632 --> 01:03:49.150
locate them before they detonate

01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:51.536
There got us at a god damn time

01:03:53.716 --> 01:03:55.103
Ben they have Molly

01:03:56.449 --> 01:03:59.268
They have her in the trunk of a car
I talked to her

01:03:59.268 --> 01:04:03.008
- Oh Jesus, Jeremy. I'm sorry
- Listen to me...

01:04:03.008 --> 01:04:04.675
They're targeting the President

01:04:05.948 --> 01:04:08.882
Well I'm getting this all second hand
but the Vice President safe

01:04:08.882 --> 01:04:10.769
I don't know about POTUS
and the first family

01:04:10.770 --> 01:04:12.738
my guess is they're already
off to locate them

01:04:12.738 --> 01:04:14.311
But I can't get confirmation

01:04:14.311 --> 01:04:16.697
I out of the loop when I took over
the loop since I took over recruitment

01:04:16.697 --> 01:04:18.517
That's what the terrorists wants

01:04:19.194 --> 01:04:21.042
They want everything to go underground

01:04:21.943 --> 01:04:23.431
What are you talking about?

01:04:24.639 --> 01:04:26.758
How the bombing has there been?

01:04:26.758 --> 01:04:29.866
Five confirmed
Andrews, Langley

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:32.265
Toll station on 395,
Reagan National

01:04:32.265 --> 01:04:33.948
and now the 14 Street Bridge

01:04:33.948 --> 01:04:36.252
that's the mass, the district
is completely paralyze

01:04:36.252 --> 01:04:37.652
That's what they're doing

01:04:39.395 --> 01:04:41.602
They've taken away all the avenues

01:04:41.602 --> 01:04:44.356
They taken away all our sources
They're contain the fucking city

01:04:44.356 --> 01:04:46.253
So nobody could get in or out

01:04:46.253 --> 01:04:49.898
- Even The President
- He's definitely been secured

01:04:49.898 --> 01:04:51.018
Yeah, Roulette

01:04:51.774 --> 01:04:53.344
That's why I'm in here

01:04:53.344 --> 01:04:54.747
They want to
location of Roulette

01:04:54.748 --> 01:04:56.562
That's what they're
trying to get out of me

01:04:56.562 --> 01:04:58.079
Jeremy, listen to me

01:04:58.079 --> 01:05:00.493
They may already have them
from one of the other captive

01:05:00.493 --> 01:05:02.562
We have to warn the protection detail

01:05:02.562 --> 01:05:05.362
No, it won't work man.
He's already in the bunker

01:05:06.126 --> 01:05:07.074
God Damn it, Jeremy

01:05:07.075 --> 01:05:09.320
There's an imminent
threat to the President

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:11.140
His location may have been compromise

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:14.109
I'll go myself just tell me where

01:05:15.288 --> 01:05:17.388
Why you asked me that Ben?

01:05:19.002 --> 01:05:20.948
You know I can't say anything

01:05:20.948 --> 01:05:22.768
They're listening to me

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:26.628
What about Molly? You never
told her anything, do you?

01:05:26.628 --> 01:05:29.660
No. No, nothing
she's know nothing

01:05:30.553 --> 01:05:32.635
They are using her as
leverage against me

01:05:32.635 --> 01:05:34.408
Jeremy, just trust me on this

01:05:34.408 --> 01:05:37.131
We're tracking the cell number,
we will find you

01:05:37.131 --> 01:05:40.119
.. Listen to me, you find Molly first

01:05:40.797 --> 01:05:44.012
You track her phone
and you find her

01:05:44.012 --> 01:05:47.551
I'm begging you man,
you do this for me, okay?

01:05:48.243 --> 01:05:50.336
Do not even think about coming for me

01:05:50.336 --> 01:05:53.103
- You find Molly
- Hey somebody get on that other line

01:05:53.103 --> 01:05:56.392
Jeremy, is there anything else you can
tell me? Anything at all?

01:05:57.431 --> 01:05:58.831
You're running out of time

01:05:59.730 --> 01:06:02.532
We're doing what we can as
fastest we can and now listen

01:06:02.532 --> 01:06:04.934
You going to have time reaching me
because we're on the move

01:06:04.934 --> 01:06:08.077
But I promise, I call you
back as soon as I can

01:06:08.077 --> 01:06:10.301
- Hanging there
- Yeah

01:06:11.584 --> 01:06:12.984
Okay, Ben

01:06:23.229 --> 01:06:24.611
For those who just joining us now

01:06:24.611 --> 01:06:26.965
We are on the line with
someone calling himself Jeremy

01:06:26.965 --> 01:06:29.057
That maybe involved in this attack

01:06:29.057 --> 01:06:30.908
- Sir, this is Real Time Morning News
- What the fuck?

01:06:30.908 --> 01:06:32.308
Are you still with us?

01:06:32.917 --> 01:06:34.639
Hang up the god damn phone

01:06:35.274 --> 01:06:38.665
Okay, can you confirm what's
taking place? Are you one of them?

01:06:38.665 --> 01:06:42.972
I said hang up the god damn phone
You're doing exactly what they want

01:06:42.972 --> 01:06:44.587
You're live on the air, sir

01:06:44.588 --> 01:06:47.637
I don't give a shit, you
know what you're doing?

01:06:47.637 --> 01:06:49.672
So, I want to repeat our
viewers right now

01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:53.029
Can you confirm whether
or not you're involved in this?

01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:55.074
No. I'm not a terrorist

01:06:55.074 --> 01:06:56.864
Then are you a hostage?
We have report

01:06:56.865 --> 01:06:58.654
that they're taking
hostages as well

01:06:58.654 --> 01:07:00.980
Who's this? What's your name?

01:07:01.944 --> 01:07:05.543
This is Jack Stern anchor
for Real Time Morning News

01:07:05.543 --> 01:07:09.019
Okay, Jack. Let's have a
little conversation. Alright?

01:07:11.168 --> 01:07:13.268
The best thing you can do for everyone

01:07:14.393 --> 01:07:17.713
is to disconnect this call. To hang up

01:07:17.713 --> 01:07:20.682
because right now you're
doing everything to their plan

01:07:20.682 --> 01:07:22.703
They want to install fear and panic

01:07:22.703 --> 01:07:25.569
You're doing that. They want paranoia

01:07:25.569 --> 01:07:28.866
You helping the bad guys man. So stop

01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:32.343
Can you tell us anything?
Anything at all about this attack?

01:07:32.343 --> 01:07:34.869
You know what, you're an asshole
you fuck-head

01:07:34.869 --> 01:07:37.497
How much do I have to
tell you to turn me off

01:09:02.696 --> 01:09:04.986
Stop this please

01:09:04.986 --> 01:09:06.738
Had enough?

01:09:06.738 --> 01:09:09.502
If you want out, give us Roulette

01:09:09.502 --> 01:09:11.973
Go fuck yourself

01:09:18.001 --> 01:09:19.401
You know

01:09:20.255 --> 01:09:22.075
I'm sorry. Alright?

01:09:25.997 --> 01:09:30.171
I'm sorry! I'll tell you, I'll tell
you what you want to know

01:09:37.581 --> 01:09:38.701
I'm sorry

01:09:45.457 --> 01:09:47.277
Listen, I'm sorry. Alright?

01:09:48.736 --> 01:09:51.536
I'm ready to talk
I'm ready to deal

01:09:53.412 --> 01:09:55.512
I know you can hear
me in there, alright?

01:09:58.379 --> 01:09:59.779
I'm listening

01:10:03.049 --> 01:10:04.869
You're an American, man

01:10:06.693 --> 01:10:09.841
You're fucking American,
Why you doing this?

01:10:10.624 --> 01:10:13.034
Why are you part of this?

01:10:13.034 --> 01:10:17.501
Just tell us where Roulette is
or this conversation is over

01:10:24.233 --> 01:10:26.962
No, It's not because you
need me, remember?

01:10:26.962 --> 01:10:30.322
You need me!
not the other way around

01:10:37.262 --> 01:10:38.662
I'm ain't telling you shit

01:10:41.161 --> 01:10:42.981
You fucking fail man

01:10:45.625 --> 01:10:47.695
You fucking fail miserably

01:10:47.695 --> 01:10:51.963
You do all of this, all this
effort and you got nothing

01:10:51.963 --> 01:10:55.390
You got nothing out of me
How about that huh?

01:10:58.119 --> 01:10:59.939
You fucking idiots

01:11:01.699 --> 01:11:05.065
5 minutes huh, 5 minutes till
what motherfucker?

01:11:05.065 --> 01:11:08.336
Until you die
Goodbye, Jeremy

01:11:08.336 --> 01:11:12.396
No. I said when this is over. I do

01:11:13.293 --> 01:11:17.037
You don't turn me off,
I turn you off!

01:11:17.037 --> 01:11:19.284
Get it?

01:11:19.284 --> 01:11:20.684
Fuck you

01:11:33.351 --> 01:11:34.593
Hello? Hello?

01:11:34.593 --> 01:11:36.577
- Jeremy
- Oh thank god, Molly

01:11:36.577 --> 01:11:39.452
- I was trying to reach you
- Well baby

01:11:39.452 --> 01:11:41.108
What is happening?
Where are you now?

01:11:41.108 --> 01:11:43.435
Emergency broadcast system in effect

01:11:43.435 --> 01:11:47.489
I've been calling you, babe
I can't reach you, are you okay?

01:11:47.489 --> 01:11:51.215
Jeremy, I think I know where I am
I think I'm in an ambulance

01:11:51.215 --> 01:11:52.264
How do you know that?

01:11:52.264 --> 01:11:55.963
It's dark in here, but I can hear the
siren, it sound like it's on top of me

01:11:55.963 --> 01:11:57.196
Hold on

01:11:57.196 --> 01:11:58.996
- What?
- Something happening

01:11:58.996 --> 01:12:00.116
Okay

01:12:01.966 --> 01:12:05.215
We're stopping, of traffic
Are you moving, Molly?

01:12:05.215 --> 01:12:06.487
Barely

01:12:06.487 --> 01:12:08.397
Please, Jeremy.
this time should get us out of here

01:12:08.397 --> 01:12:10.893
I promise you, baby
I got the whole team on this

01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:12.872
The whole office is looking for you

01:12:12.872 --> 01:12:15.672
They're going to find you
I promise you baby. I promise

01:12:15.672 --> 01:12:17.466
Okay. Good

01:12:22.195 --> 01:12:24.056
- What?
- Molly, talk louder

01:12:24.056 --> 01:12:26.156
What happening? Jeremy,
Are you okay?

01:12:28.091 --> 01:12:29.211
Holy fuck

01:12:29.964 --> 01:12:32.633
you're right.
You're in an ambulance and

01:12:32.634 --> 01:12:35.302
I'm in the back of a
fucking police car

01:12:36.145 --> 01:12:37.705
- Jeremy?
- Molly, Mol

01:12:37.705 --> 01:12:40.118
Jeremy, I can't, I can't,
can you hear me?

01:12:40.119 --> 01:12:40.721
Molly

01:12:42.522 --> 01:12:43.642
Molly

01:12:45.333 --> 01:12:46.789
Fuck

01:13:23.231 --> 01:13:25.106
Come on, hold on

01:13:29.209 --> 01:13:29.888
- Hello?
- Ben?

01:13:29.889 --> 01:13:32.290
Hold that and get to her
as fast as possible

01:13:32.290 --> 01:13:35.095
Jeremy, listen. We've located Molly
and we are on our the way

01:13:35.095 --> 01:13:37.033
Where is she?

01:13:37.033 --> 01:13:39.803
- DuPont Circle
- DuPont Circle?

01:13:41.308 --> 01:13:43.187
It is a mile from
the White House

01:13:43.188 --> 01:13:45.896
I know, I know.
We're working as fast as we can

01:13:45.896 --> 01:13:48.903
- Well work faster
- We're trying, it's chaos out here

01:13:48.903 --> 01:13:51.616
Road are grid lock, I don't even
know how they're transporting her

01:13:51.616 --> 01:13:54.959
Look, she's inside of an ambulance
and I at the back of a police car

01:13:54.959 --> 01:13:56.681
That's how they take
us through traffic

01:13:56.681 --> 01:13:57.871
Jesus

01:13:57.871 --> 01:14:00.497
Guys, she's inside of an ambulance
Let's go, let's go

01:14:01.392 --> 01:14:03.319
I'm not moving right now

01:14:03.319 --> 01:14:05.413
As far as I know, she's not either

01:14:06.625 --> 01:14:10.150
- You're running out of time, man
- How much time?

01:14:10.727 --> 01:14:12.759
You got about 3 minutes

01:14:12.759 --> 01:14:15.223
You need to clear the area

01:14:15.223 --> 01:14:18.405
and keep the roadblocks in
place, don't let any cars through

01:14:18.405 --> 01:14:20.719
Not even emergency
vehicles, you hear me?

01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:21.821
I'll do what I can

01:14:21.821 --> 01:14:24.417
Now, you promise you don't
let any cars through

01:14:24.417 --> 01:14:26.515
Look, Jeremy. I can't promise anything

01:14:26.515 --> 01:14:27.915
Ben? Ben?!

01:14:29.917 --> 01:14:31.037
Ben?

01:14:38.724 --> 01:14:39.549
Ben?

01:14:39.549 --> 01:14:40.911
One last chance, Jeremy

01:14:40.912 --> 01:14:43.399
Give us the fucking
location of Roulette

01:14:43.399 --> 01:14:47.222
I'm not giving you anything
I'm not giving you a god damn thing

01:14:47.222 --> 01:14:51.430
Then good luck to you, Agent Raines
I'll tell Molly, good bye for you

01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:54.243
You lay one hand on her,
I'm going to fucking kill you

01:15:08.912 --> 01:15:10.032
Oh come on

01:15:10.625 --> 01:15:13.749
Please pick up
Please. Please pick up

01:15:17.246 --> 01:15:19.368
- Jeremy?
- Hello, Molly

01:15:19.368 --> 01:15:23.822
- Oh thank god. Are you okay?
- I'm moving again

01:15:23.822 --> 01:15:26.763
God fucking roadblocks. I told them
to keep them in place

01:15:26.763 --> 01:15:29.811
What roadblocks?
Jeremy, what the hell is going on?

01:15:29.812 --> 01:15:30.731
What's happening?

01:15:30.731 --> 01:15:34.581
- Listen to me. Do you trust me?
- Jeremy

01:15:34.581 --> 01:15:38.568
- Do you trust me?
- Yes, I trust you

01:15:40.337 --> 01:15:41.457
Okay

01:15:43.125 --> 01:15:46.456
- We're together, baby
- What

01:15:46.456 --> 01:15:48.696
We're traveling right
next to each other

01:15:49.890 --> 01:15:54.131
What? Do you tell them
what they wanted to know?

01:15:54.131 --> 01:15:58.664
No. I can't do that

01:16:01.612 --> 01:16:03.432
I took an oath, Molly

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:07.558
Jeremy, Please

01:16:07.558 --> 01:16:11.536
I don't want to
die today, please

01:16:11.537 --> 01:16:16.765
Just give them what they want.
Please, for me

01:16:18.834 --> 01:16:21.540
I never want to do anything
to let you down there

01:16:22.688 --> 01:16:24.742
I know that I done things to you

01:16:26.758 --> 01:16:28.842
I never wanted to in my life

01:16:29.839 --> 01:16:31.239
Jeremy

01:16:32.553 --> 01:16:34.873
I hurt you and I'm sorry

01:16:37.335 --> 01:16:40.494
I can't think about those things now
I can't do anything about it

01:16:42.427 --> 01:16:45.065
but I ask you now to accept me

01:16:47.763 --> 01:16:49.163
to accept me for who I am

01:16:51.459 --> 01:16:55.982
Of course, of course baby
I accept your

01:16:55.982 --> 01:16:59.149
I love you, no matter what

01:16:59.149 --> 01:17:03.634
- I love you so much
- ... I love you

01:17:05.022 --> 01:17:06.834
I love you so much

01:17:09.835 --> 01:17:10.955
Molly

01:17:13.824 --> 01:17:15.861
... It filled up. Molly

01:17:16.633 --> 01:17:17.753
What the fuck?

01:17:51.904 --> 01:17:53.247
- Hello?
- Jeremy, it’s Ben

01:17:53.247 --> 01:17:55.105
Ben

01:17:55.105 --> 01:17:57.897
Bin, it almost fill up to the top man

01:17:57.897 --> 01:18:01.573
I know, it's binary
explosive, liquid bomb

01:18:01.573 --> 01:18:04.626
and you're dead either way
but I can save Molly

01:18:04.626 --> 01:18:07.183
So tell us what we want to know

01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:08.303
We?

01:18:09.508 --> 01:18:11.295
You're part of this, Ben?

01:18:12.224 --> 01:18:15.255
- It's just business my friend
- It's not business

01:18:15.255 --> 01:18:17.624
Give us the location of Roulette

01:18:17.624 --> 01:18:22.156
You're a coward, man
You're a fucking traitor

01:18:22.156 --> 01:18:23.204
You were my friend

01:18:23.204 --> 01:18:27.683
- Enough, give us Roulette
- You were my friend man

01:18:27.683 --> 01:18:29.503
Goodbye, Jeremy

01:19:07.367 --> 01:19:08.487
Molly

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:22.905
breathe, Jeremy
breathe, take it easy

01:20:29.093 --> 01:20:30.817
Jeremy

01:20:30.817 --> 01:20:33.599
Whoa. Easy, easy
You're safe now

01:20:34.192 --> 01:20:35.571
Jeremy

01:20:35.571 --> 01:20:39.974
It's Henry
... I'm Henry. It's Henry

01:20:39.974 --> 01:20:43.383
Put the gun down. Okay?
everything is cool. Alright?

01:20:43.383 --> 01:20:46.580
Jeremy? Jeremy, I'm here

01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:48.584
- Molly
- I'm okay

01:21:01.799 --> 01:21:03.619
You did good, real good

01:21:04.294 --> 01:21:06.808
Are you kidding, boss?
He did fucking great

01:21:06.808 --> 01:21:08.945
This guy is fucking hardcore

01:21:08.945 --> 01:21:11.528
Ben, don't fucking moves

01:21:11.528 --> 01:21:15.288
Jeremy. Stop! It is over

01:21:15.288 --> 01:21:18.800
Stop what? What's over?
What the fuck is this?

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:21.928
It was merely and exercise
and you pass, Jeremy

01:21:21.928 --> 01:21:23.328
You pass with flying colours

01:21:24.318 --> 01:21:25.718
I don't understand

01:21:27.575 --> 01:21:28.975
Stay back

01:21:29.628 --> 01:21:32.886
I didn't transfer to
recruitment last year

01:21:32.886 --> 01:21:38.011
I'm the protection detail training
coordinator, and you're in Towns ville

01:21:39.269 --> 01:21:41.393
This is AOP training ground

01:21:56.303 --> 01:21:57.423
You did all this?

01:22:00.498 --> 01:22:02.706
You set all this up? Why?

01:22:02.706 --> 01:22:05.562
Yeah, we have done a lot of
stress tests since 9/11

01:22:05.562 --> 01:22:08.353
It sure beat a hell out of
polygraph don't you think?

01:22:08.353 --> 01:22:10.073
and it was important, Jeremy

01:22:10.073 --> 01:22:13.525
It was crucial for your transfer
to the presidential detail

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:17.088
starting next month
you're on the asian trip

01:22:18.186 --> 01:22:21.126
Congratulations, you're on
your way to the show

01:22:22.687 --> 01:22:25.125
- Keep it up, Agent Raines
- Nice work, man

01:22:25.658 --> 01:22:26.778
Congratulations

01:22:27.346 --> 01:22:29.166
- Nice job
- Awesome

01:22:32.464 --> 01:22:34.657
911, what is your emergency?

01:22:34.657 --> 01:22:37.603
My outer ego, great great
work Agent Raines

01:22:38.507 --> 01:22:42.662
Heading the I-95
Agent Danielle Wade, retired

01:22:42.662 --> 01:22:43.782
Great job

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:53.089
I had to, you can know my inner
actress in my high school drama dates

01:22:54.328 --> 01:22:57.700
We told her about the
importance of this exercise,

01:22:57.701 --> 01:22:59.617
and Molly agreed to help us

01:23:02.219 --> 01:23:04.563
- I'm so sorry
- No

01:23:05.501 --> 01:23:08.261
This guy has lost a lot of blood,
we got to get this leg patch up

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:11.767
Sorry about that hot weld ammunition

01:23:11.767 --> 01:23:14.390
We probably made it way too much

01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:16.415
We visit that in the next exercise

01:23:16.415 --> 01:23:19.284
Yeah, that'll be a good idea

01:23:20.827 --> 01:23:22.902
Meet you at the hospital
for debriefing

01:23:23.559 --> 01:23:24.679
Hey Ben

01:23:27.251 --> 01:23:29.351
You really had me man

01:23:30.918 --> 01:23:32.038
Yeah

01:23:33.410 --> 01:23:35.293
That was the idea

01:23:36.998 --> 01:23:38.537
Alright, ladies and gentlemen.

01:23:38.538 --> 01:23:40.589
Great job, let wrap
it up and go home

01:23:44.564 --> 01:23:47.322
Give us the location of Roulette

01:23:58.652 --> 01:24:03.011
Hey. Hey, hey, it's okay. I'm here

01:24:04.685 --> 01:24:06.025
- Where am I?
- Better be careful

01:24:06.025 --> 01:24:09.058
you going to wreck this
thing out of your arm

01:24:09.058 --> 01:24:10.763
You're in an ambulance

01:24:11.604 --> 01:24:15.726
You pass out, they gave you
a sedative and a new IV

01:24:15.726 --> 01:24:17.680
- Hi
- Hi

01:24:21.133 --> 01:24:25.043
- How long have I been out?
- About half an hour

01:24:25.043 --> 01:24:27.386
We pull out into Walter
Reed in about 15 minutes
