10:14.570 --> 10:16.470

10:16.505 --> 10:18.472
So, Gordon,
you have three cooks each.

10:18.507 --> 10:20.807
How would you divide the labor

10:20.843 --> 10:23.210
(Gordon) Three talented

You're going to have to
divide and conquer.

10:26.048 --> 10:27.492
Four, four, and five.
So they just focus on

10:27.516 --> 10:28.915
four portions each.
Yeah.

10:28.951 --> 10:30.929

18:15.573 --> 18:18.006
Look at that compared
to that right there.

18:18.042 --> 18:19.842
Yep. But your scallop's
got color.

18:19.877 --> 18:22.177
- Yeah.
- My scallop looks boiled.

18:22.213 --> 18:24.357
How are you enjoying your
red snapper from the Red Team?

18:24.381 --> 18:25.848
I like it, I like it.

18:25.883 --> 18:29.184
The skin's nice and crisp
and the fish is nice and soft.

18:29.220 --> 18:31.920
So, Brian, you've got the
red snapper from the Blue Team.

18:31.956 --> 18:33.121
- Yes, I do.
- How is that?

18:33.157 --> 18:36.058
I'm gonna say that
the searing...

18:36.093 --> 18:37.693
maybe another 30 seconds.

18:37.728 --> 18:40.362
But other than that,
I thought it was a home run.

18:40.397 --> 18:42.209
Unfortunately, the Blue Team
was somewhat lagging,

18:42.233 --> 18:43.765
and they've forgotten my fish.

18:43.801 --> 18:45.901
Would you like some of
my fish from the Red Team?

18:45.936 --> 18:47.803
I'm fine, thank you, darling.
Thank you.

18:47.838 --> 18:51.707
Loved the sear that was on
the snapper itself.

18:51.742 --> 18:54.142
Nice and crispy. I loved it.
And the broth was great.

18:54.178 --> 18:57.179
Right, Red Team, Blue Team,
listen up, please.

this competition?

19:51.602 --> 19:54.069
- No, Chef.
- We had a slow start.

We always say
the most important thing

20:14.858 --> 20:16.569
is how you finish,
so what do you think that

20:16.593 --> 20:19.294
each of these teams has learned
from doing that appetizer?

20:19.330 --> 20:22.331
I mean, each team understands
that communication is pivotal,

20:22.366 --> 20:24.032

Yeah.

20:24.068 --> 20:25.801
Just watch these like a hawk.

20:25.836 --> 20:28.370
(Gordon) Searing that venison
has gotta be done gently.

20:28.405 --> 20:29.605
You gotta cook that with love.

20:29.640 --> 20:30.917
Almost more delicately
than you do with a filet mignon.

20:30.941 --> 20:34.376
There's no fat on there,
so if they sear it too heavy,

20:34.411 --> 20:36.011
it's dry on the outside.

20:36.046 --> 20:38.180
And then baste.
Baste, baste, baste.

20:38.215 --> 20:39.693
Remember, it's gonna cook
a little bit

20:39.717 --> 20:40.994
while you're basting it
especially,

20:41.018 --> 20:43.885

No, Chef.

these entrees, let's go.

Come on, JJ, you better be
cooking that fast.

27:28.210 --> 27:30.010
It's in the oven, guys.

27:30.045 --> 27:32.913
JJ, you are gonna cut
and put the meat on, okay?

27:32.948 --> 27:36.316
Go, go.
JJ, if you mess up that venison,

27:36.352 --> 27:37.751
it's all on you right now.

27:37.786 --> 27:39.219
<i>(JJ) I feel like I
let my team down,</i>

27:39.254 --> 27:41.121

27:44.727 --> 27:45.993

27:46.028 --> 27:47.761
Someone slices.
Avery, can you slice?

27:47.796 --> 27:50.397
I'll slice it.
Avery's doing stuff.

27:50.432 --> 27:52.532
- I'll do it.
- Zac, if you need to,

27:52.568 --> 27:54.368
you gotta relinquish
the slicing duty.

27:54.403 --> 27:57.504
All right, very thin.
See how small that is, okay?

27:57.539 --> 28:00.307
And then you need five pieces,
so about there.

28:00.342 --> 28:03.043
See, look, like that, okay?
It has to be thin.

28:03.078 --> 28:05.834
It's gotta be perfect, guys.
This isn't like chopping onions.

28:05.914 --> 28:07.381

28:07.416 --> 28:09.516
<i>(Zac) Slicing the meat
right is really crucial</i>

28:09.551 --> 28:12.352

a three-Michelin Star dish.

Amaya knows what she's doing,</i>

just pack it up.

Two minutes, guys. Let's go.
Red Team, Blue Team, please.

Amaya, that's way too thin.

Look how thin that is.
Zac, I need your help.

28:39.280 --> 28:42.748
Avery, Amaya's not slicing
the meat right.

28:42.784 --> 28:45.685
I am the oldest, and I have to
step up to the plate...

28:45.720 --> 28:47.653
I'm gonna try for the parsnip.

28:47.689 --> 28:50.089
Otherwise we're not gonna
win this challenge,

28:50.124 --> 28:51.724

- Good. They're looking good.

28:53.928 --> 28:55.172

I'm impressed with Zac.

28:55.196 --> 28:56.929
He seems to be
composed and calm.

28:56.965 --> 28:58.631
He's a multitasker,
that's for sure.

28:58.666 --> 28:59.799

28:59.834 --> 29:01.245

and be able to recover.

29:01.269 --> 29:03.669

prepared by kids?

No. They got no idea
that these guys

No idea.

30:13.041 --> 30:15.608

31:38.693 --> 31:43.262
the Blue Team's venison
was slightly overcooked.

was incredible.

needed a touch more seasoning.

37:36.002 --> 37:41.806
Two of you will see your
MasterChef journey end here.

37:41.841 --> 37:44.509
(Gordon) Trust me, it's been a
very difficult decision to make.

37:44.544 --> 37:46.622
Probably the hardest one
we've ever had to make so far

37:46.646 --> 37:49.347
in this competition.

37:49.382 --> 37:53.151
The young cook that we
are going to be saving,

37:53.186 --> 37:56.087
the one who will join Zac,
Amaya, and Avery on the balcony

37:56.122 --> 37:59.357
and move into the semifinals
of <i> MasterChef Junior,</i>

37:59.392 --> 38:02.393
that person is...

38:07.300 --> 38:08.533
Addison.

38:08.568 --> 38:10.601
Oh, my God.

38:10.637 --> 38:14.572
Addison, when your team
got in the trenches,

38:14.607 --> 38:16.941
you hung in there,
you motivated,

38:16.976 --> 38:20.044
but more importantly,
you maintained the standards.

38:20.079 --> 38:21.445
Great job.

38:21.481 --> 38:23.281
How are you feeling?

38:23.316 --> 38:26.884
I'm very proud of myself
to get to the semifinals,

38:26.920 --> 38:31.022
but also I'm very disappointed
to see Kya and JJ go.

38:31.057 --> 38:36.093
Please say good-bye
to JJ and Kya and head upstairs.

38:36.129 --> 38:38.229
Kya.

38:38.264 --> 38:40.064
Bye, guys.
Bye.

38:40.099 --> 38:42.099
Keep cooking.

38:46.773 --> 38:48.539
(Gordon)
Oh, dear, Kya and JJ,

38:48.575 --> 38:50.975
this doesn't get easy
for any of us.

38:51.010 --> 38:55.179
Kya, from your sous vide
poached chicken breast

38:55.215 --> 38:58.349
and red wine to some of
the most amazing dishes,

38:58.384 --> 39:00.218
you have literally
blown us away.

39:00.253 --> 39:01.430
How are you feeling, my darling?

39:01.454 --> 39:03.821
Even though
I'm a little disappointed

39:03.856 --> 39:08.059
that I got eliminated, but I'm
happy that I made it this far.

39:08.094 --> 39:12.263
JJ, I can see you having
an amazing Texas steakhouse.

39:12.298 --> 39:16.467
And when you get that open,
call me.

39:16.502 --> 39:17.902
- Yes, Chef.
- I'll be there first.

39:17.937 --> 39:19.237
Yes, Chef.

39:19.272 --> 39:22.640
Both of you come up
and say good-bye.

39:22.675 --> 39:25.443
Take care, my darling.
Oh, man.

39:25.478 --> 39:28.412
Come here, "Mr. Hunter."
Good to see you, bud.

39:28.448 --> 39:32.083
- Great job.
- I'm gonna miss you.

39:32.118 --> 39:35.953
Right, JJ, four left.
You know them inside out.

39:35.989 --> 39:37.521
In your mind, who's gonna become

39:37.557 --> 39:39.190
America's next
MasterChef Junior?

39:39.225 --> 39:42.360
- Zac.
- Wow, interesting. Kya?

39:42.395 --> 39:43.861
I think Addison's
going to become

39:43.896 --> 39:46.430
the next MasterChef Junior.

39:46.466 --> 39:48.299
Guys, safe trip home.

39:48.334 --> 39:50.801
Take care.

39:50.837 --> 39:52.169
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

39:52.205 --> 39:54.272
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, JJ.

39:54.307 --> 39:57.174
<i>(JJ) I'm only 12 years
old, but I did my best,</i>

39:57.210 --> 40:00.611
and I'm going back to Texas
a much stronger cook

40:00.647 --> 40:02.213
than I was ever before.

40:02.248 --> 40:05.216
So much soul in the flavor
of that enchilada sauce.

40:05.251 --> 40:07.451
That is delicious.

40:07.487 --> 40:10.054
<i>Even though I didn't win
the MasterChef Junior trophy,</i>

40:10.089 --> 40:12.123
I still feel
really proud of myself.

40:12.158 --> 40:13.924
Whether you like it or not,

40:13.960 --> 40:16.827
at eight years of age,
you are a freak.

40:16.863 --> 40:18.062
[laughing]

40:18.097 --> 40:21.198
And I'll never, ever forget
when I get to

40:21.234 --> 40:24.969
put the marshmallow bomb,
and... boom!

40:25.004 --> 40:27.571
[all screaming]

40:27.607 --> 40:29.740
(Gordon)
Marshmallows!

40:29.776 --> 40:31.208
[laughing]

40:31.244 --> 40:34.745
My journey in the MasterChef
Junior kitchen was amazing.

40:34.781 --> 40:36.847
<i>I'll never forget it.</i>

40:36.883 --> 40:38.182
All right, JJ.

40:38.217 --> 40:41.319
It is the leaning tower
of croque-en-bouche.

40:41.354 --> 40:43.988
Gordon, sorry for burning
your leg.

40:44.023 --> 40:45.723
- Ah!
- Are you okay?

40:45.758 --> 40:47.825
But thank you
for giving a chance

40:47.860 --> 40:50.928
to a small town kid from Texas.
Well done.

40:50.963 --> 40:53.397
<i>The one thing I learned
in the MasterChef kitchen</i>

40:53.433 --> 40:56.100
is you just got to feel happy
and proud of yourself

40:56.135 --> 40:57.568
<i>for everything you did.</i>

40:57.603 --> 41:00.237
<i>It's not the end,
it's just the beginning.</i>

41:00.273 --> 41:02.773
I can't imagine what I'm going
to do when I'm 18.

41:07.714 --> 41:08.913
<i>(narrator)
Next week...</i>

41:08.948 --> 41:13.284
This is the semifinals
of <i> MasterChef Junior.</i>

41:13.319 --> 41:16.387
<i>(narrator) The final four compete
for a spot in the finale.</i>

41:16.422 --> 41:17.588
Bake, bake, bake.

41:17.623 --> 41:19.156
<i>(narrator)
Only two will rise</i>

41:19.192 --> 41:22.460
<i>and earn the chance of winning
$100,000...</i>

41:22.495 --> 41:23.961
Holy guacamole.

41:23.996 --> 41:27.465
<i>And the title of America's
MasterChef Junior.</i>

41:27.500 --> 41:29.633
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- You are the four best

41:29.669 --> 41:31.135
left in this competition.

41:31.170 --> 41:33.650
<i>(Addison) This is the
most intense thing...</i>

41:33.730 --> 41:34.929
Ever!

41:35.009 --> 41:37.234
- This is gonna be a hard one.
- Very hard.
