00:35.705 --> 00:38.634
Episode Title :
<font color=#FFFF00>"Goodbye and Goodwill"</font>

00:40.107 --> 00:43.172
I can't express
just how much

00:43.259 --> 00:45.487
this time in Vardaros
has meant to us.

00:45.574 --> 00:48.001
We may have come here
as strangers,

00:48.088 --> 00:51.854
but I like to think
we're leaving as friends.

00:52.009 --> 00:54.024
So, in the spirit of that friendship,

00:54.111 --> 00:57.673
we would like to share
a Corona tradition with all of you.

00:57.760 --> 00:59.597
I am proud to announce

00:59.688 --> 01:05.307
the First Annual Vardaros
Goodwill Festival!

01:06.939 --> 01:08.528
Boo!

01:09.087 --> 01:11.803
Yeah, I got booed
at last year's festival, too.

01:11.890 --> 01:14.807
Don't worry.
This is gonna be fantastic.

01:19.806 --> 01:21.748
It's great that
you wanna do this, Raps,

01:21.835 --> 01:23.696
but this town isn't like
Corona.

01:23.783 --> 01:27.639
They don't feel the need to celebrate
something every six seconds.

01:27.726 --> 01:29.631
You should really listen to Cass.

01:29.718 --> 01:33.065
Vardarans aren't really
the "goodwill" kind of crowd.

01:33.152 --> 01:35.768
I hate goodwill, ya clod!

01:36.087 --> 01:39.407
I know people here are a little
rougher around the edges,

01:39.494 --> 01:41.860
but they deserve
to have a good time.

01:41.947 --> 01:43.821
Are you sure
everyone shares your idea

01:43.908 --> 01:45.650
of what makes a good time?

01:45.737 --> 01:46.978
Look.

01:47.361 --> 01:49.995
Not one person has signed up
for the Gopher Grab.

01:50.095 --> 01:53.815
Which might not be a bad thing,
since we don't have a gopher.

01:53.970 --> 01:55.915
Hey, hey,
don't worry about that.

01:56.002 --> 01:59.157
I've got my two best
gopher hunters on the job.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.469
Ow! Oh! Aah! You're pulling.
You're pulling.

02:01.556 --> 02:04.438
You know how much I...
Aah! Aah! You're pulling!

02:04.525 --> 02:07.821
I'm sure they're out there
snaggin' a gopher as we speak.

02:07.970 --> 02:09.180
Probably.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.654
You know, we may actually
wanna cancel the Gopher Grab?

02:11.741 --> 02:14.040
It'll be tough
finding a gopher out here.

02:14.127 --> 02:15.702
This is sneezeweasel country.

02:15.789 --> 02:17.461
I'm so sorry.
What's a sneezeweasel?

02:17.548 --> 02:20.633
It's a mammalian omnivore,
indigenous to this region,

02:20.720 --> 02:23.589
whose primary diet
is gophers, foxes...

02:23.986 --> 02:25.000
and voles.

02:25.087 --> 02:29.261
Um, Shorty, how do you know
so much about sneezeweasels?

02:30.134 --> 02:31.807
I used to be one.

02:31.900 --> 02:33.834
Oh. That's better.

02:34.009 --> 02:38.120
Look! Someone's signing
up for the Gopher Grab!

02:38.611 --> 02:41.313
And you thought the good cheer
wouldn't catch on.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.518
Actually,
he's stealing your quill.

02:44.439 --> 02:45.509
Hey!

02:45.596 --> 02:46.697
Huh?

02:51.172 --> 02:53.345
You want the pen so bad...

02:53.970 --> 02:55.110
then sign up.

02:55.197 --> 02:58.330
Okay, okay,
I'll sign up!

02:58.805 --> 03:00.408
What is this?

03:01.786 --> 03:04.810
Uh, Cass,
we're celebrating goodwill?

03:04.897 --> 03:06.157
Remember?

03:07.767 --> 03:10.383
Anyone else wanna wrestle me
for the pen?

03:10.572 --> 03:12.752
You lose, you sign up!

03:12.839 --> 03:15.052
Me!

03:15.283 --> 03:17.323
- Let's do this!
- Okay, then.

03:17.964 --> 03:19.643
Who's next?

03:21.000 --> 03:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:28.244 --> 03:30.709
Captain, I know
why you wanna see us,

03:30.796 --> 03:35.180
and I'm sure it wasn't Cass'
intention to injure 16 people...

03:35.267 --> 03:37.904
- Uh, it was 23.
- It's just that...

03:37.991 --> 03:42.110
Rapunzel, I haven't seen folks
that excited in years.

03:42.197 --> 03:43.494
Nice job.

03:44.048 --> 03:46.583
When you told me
about this goodwill nonsense,

03:46.670 --> 03:50.594
I thought there's no way that this
feel-good garbage is gonna fly here.

03:50.681 --> 03:55.167
But that's before I saw
what Cass had up her sleeve.

03:55.470 --> 03:56.641
To be clear,

03:56.728 --> 03:59.180
that wasn't
an official festival event.

03:59.267 --> 04:00.461
Well, it should've been!

04:00.548 --> 04:02.550
You should have Cass plan
all of your events.

04:02.637 --> 04:05.530
Huh. Actually,
that's not such a bad idea.

04:05.617 --> 04:08.527
I mean, I know this party stuff
isn't your strong suit,

04:08.614 --> 04:11.230
but it would be fun
to work together.

04:11.317 --> 04:12.503
What do you say?

04:12.590 --> 04:14.259
You wanna be my co-planner?

04:14.346 --> 04:18.300
Ha! Me?
Co-planning a festival?

04:18.430 --> 04:20.891
- Hmm, why not?
- Great!

04:20.978 --> 04:24.065
- Can I help?
- Of course you can.

04:24.275 --> 04:26.659
I was actually asking Cass.

04:30.943 --> 04:32.909
Here, gophy-gophy!

04:33.025 --> 04:35.073
Here, gophy!

04:37.322 --> 04:39.837
Gophy!

04:40.611 --> 04:42.581
Aah! This is pointless!

04:42.668 --> 04:46.137
Listen. We promised to find a gopher,

04:46.224 --> 04:48.034
and I don't like breaking promises.

04:48.121 --> 04:51.688
Oh, come on, you break
promises all the time!

04:51.775 --> 04:54.055
I do it, I just don't like it.

04:57.017 --> 04:58.283
What is it?

04:58.603 --> 05:00.018
I'm not scared.

05:02.940 --> 05:05.423
Hey, yo, Foot, is this a gopher?

05:05.510 --> 05:07.144
I don't know.
Check the picture.

05:14.489 --> 05:16.092
Nope, too cute.

05:16.208 --> 05:19.936
I can't believe I
thought that was a gopher.

05:20.106 --> 05:23.858
Much too fancy.
Such a knucklehead.

05:24.091 --> 05:27.746
Okay, partner,
here is the list of events.

05:27.833 --> 05:31.514
It's a fifth draft, so it should
be pretty close to final.

05:31.601 --> 05:33.691
Hmm,
okay, let's see.

05:33.778 --> 05:37.456
Bobbing for apples...
ring toss... juggling?

05:37.543 --> 05:41.356
Raps, are you sure people here
are into... pony rides?

05:41.443 --> 05:43.020
Who doesn't love pony rides?

05:43.107 --> 05:45.173
I hate pony rides!

05:45.260 --> 05:46.747
Ya clod!

05:47.036 --> 05:50.196
Like I said... not final.

05:50.388 --> 05:54.280
Okay. Um, did you have
any ideas for events?

05:57.462 --> 05:58.486
Hmm.

05:58.573 --> 06:01.952
Human Piñata?
Spit Target Practice?

06:02.122 --> 06:04.916
Okay, I-I don't even
know what this is!

06:05.003 --> 06:08.033
That would be
Piranha Dunk Tank, Rapunzel.

06:08.120 --> 06:11.491
Um, I'm not quite sure
these scream goodwill.

06:11.935 --> 06:14.574
Goodwill Scream Contest!
Great idea!

06:14.661 --> 06:16.889
We can see who can scream the loudest!

06:16.976 --> 06:18.089
Outta my way!

06:18.176 --> 06:20.866
And there's the guy to beat!

06:22.193 --> 06:24.129
Cass, uh,
don't get me wrong,

06:24.216 --> 06:25.916
I love your ideas,

06:26.003 --> 06:28.983
but event planning
takes a certain...

06:29.224 --> 06:30.513
skill set.

06:30.708 --> 06:31.767
Skill set?

06:31.854 --> 06:35.309
Are you suggesting I don't know
how to help people have fun?

06:35.396 --> 06:38.943
No! No, no, no, no...

06:39.030 --> 06:40.247
No!

06:40.606 --> 06:41.818
Maybe?

06:42.541 --> 06:45.866
Well, I don't want you to take
this the wrong way, Rapunzel,

06:45.982 --> 06:49.040
but maybe the reason
Vex suggested I be co-planner

06:49.127 --> 06:51.789
is because
you lack a certain skill set.

06:53.593 --> 06:56.201
Well, then, Cassandra,
if that's the case,

06:56.288 --> 07:00.287
maybe you should host your own
events for the Goodwill Festival.

07:00.374 --> 07:02.274
Maybe I should!
Thank you!

07:02.361 --> 07:06.628
After all, twice as many events
means twice as much festival!

07:06.715 --> 07:10.949
I agree! That way,
everybody wins!

07:11.036 --> 07:12.577
Well, then it's settled.

07:12.664 --> 07:16.829
I'm glad we could work this
disagreement out without arguing!

07:16.969 --> 07:20.683
It's what friends do!

07:23.714 --> 07:25.490
Hey, Blondie.
Everything all right?

07:25.577 --> 07:29.641
Yes! My friend and I were just
making polite conversation!

07:38.122 --> 07:40.804
Here we go.
Festival time.

07:40.891 --> 07:45.039
Yep! Let's cram some goodwill
down this town's throat!

07:45.204 --> 07:46.954
Uh, sure.

07:47.041 --> 07:50.820
Now, remember, Cass, if people don't
like your events, don't get upset.

07:50.942 --> 07:51.986
I'm not worried about it.

07:52.073 --> 07:54.303
Good! And I really hope
your events go well.

07:54.390 --> 07:57.641
After all, if this Goodwill
Festival is a success,

07:57.896 --> 08:00.264
- we all win.
- Totally.

08:00.351 --> 08:04.256
And besides, it's not like it's
a competition or anything.

08:04.343 --> 08:07.080
Right. Right, of course.
It's about showing the Vardarans

08:07.167 --> 08:10.188
as much fun as possible.

08:16.935 --> 08:21.161
Whew!
That's 65 apples for me.

08:21.304 --> 08:22.663
Whew!

08:30.521 --> 08:32.131
Yes! Yes!

08:34.027 --> 08:35.866
Excuse me.

08:40.857 --> 08:42.357
Hmm?

08:48.849 --> 08:51.810
Well, at least you got your looks.

08:51.897 --> 08:53.758
Oops! No, you don't!

08:54.132 --> 08:55.554
Whoa!

08:55.779 --> 08:56.827
Hmm?

09:08.132 --> 09:09.133
Hmm!

09:12.423 --> 09:14.159
Boo!

09:15.693 --> 09:19.371
Honey Wall! Honey Wall!

09:19.458 --> 09:21.593
Honey Wall!

09:21.680 --> 09:23.289
All right,
whoever makes Shorty stick

09:23.376 --> 09:24.615
to Captain Quaid's Honey Wall

09:24.702 --> 09:27.377
the longest is our winner!

09:28.679 --> 09:30.146
Ready?

09:31.370 --> 09:34.396
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

09:36.347 --> 09:41.426
It's been a long time since I've been
thrown into a good wall of honey.

09:41.513 --> 09:47.049
Honey Wall!
Honey Wall! Honey Wall!

09:48.270 --> 09:50.636
Okay, so her events are
getting a lot more attention.

09:50.723 --> 09:52.888
But that doesn't mean
mine are bad, right?

09:54.196 --> 09:57.209
Eugene, are Cassandra's
events more fun than mine?

09:57.296 --> 10:00.885
Are Cassandra's events
more fun than yours?

10:03.102 --> 10:06.267
Uh, uh. Are Cassandra's
events more fun...

10:06.422 --> 10:08.947
than... yours?

10:10.208 --> 10:11.434
Hmm.

10:14.100 --> 10:15.338
You know what?

10:15.425 --> 10:17.818
The important thing here is,
uh, is that... that people

10:17.905 --> 10:19.467
are having fun,
yeah, you know,

10:19.554 --> 10:22.716
and isn't that the whole point
of a Goodwill Festival?

10:22.803 --> 10:26.170
And that Gopher Grab tomorrow is
gonna make everything even better,

10:26.257 --> 10:27.371
so, maybe the two of you

10:27.458 --> 10:30.609
should just get together
and work it out, huh?

10:31.150 --> 10:33.638
Yeah.
You're right.

10:36.527 --> 10:39.231
Well, Max, I hope you learned
something there.

10:42.903 --> 10:46.513
Well, uh,
it might be time to admit defeat.

10:47.520 --> 10:49.009
Shh! Wait!

10:49.114 --> 10:50.848
Hmm...

11:04.439 --> 11:08.823
Foot, old buddy.
I think we've got our gopher.

11:10.228 --> 11:11.383
Hey, Cass?

11:11.470 --> 11:13.432
I just wanted to say...

11:13.892 --> 11:14.900
Cass?

11:21.579 --> 11:22.725
Cass?

11:25.164 --> 11:28.479
Yeesh! What is Cass
planning to do with that?

11:28.609 --> 11:33.487
Wow. Nothing says goodwill
like nunchucks, I guess.

11:37.175 --> 11:39.774
Whew! Okay, looks like
she's got the, uh,

11:39.861 --> 11:42.163
creepy clown events covered too, huh?

11:43.259 --> 11:44.341
Oof!

11:44.461 --> 11:46.825
Oh. Cass, hi. You're here.

11:46.912 --> 11:50.369
Of course I'm here. This is my tent.
What are you...

11:50.540 --> 11:53.563
Wait a minute.
I know what this is about.

11:53.650 --> 11:56.594
- You're here to steal my event ideas.
- No, I'm not.

11:56.681 --> 11:57.863
Why would I do that?

11:57.950 --> 12:01.201
I just figured, since yours
were so... disastrous.

12:01.288 --> 12:04.750
Uh, well,
they weren't disastrous, Cass,

12:04.837 --> 12:08.414
and I don't need to steal your
bad ideas, thank you very much.

12:08.501 --> 12:10.346
I have plenty of my own.

12:10.798 --> 12:13.174
Okay, you have
plenty of bad ideas?

12:14.072 --> 12:15.779
What? No.

12:15.866 --> 12:17.422
You know what I mean!

12:17.509 --> 12:21.518
Look, Raps, I'm sorry if people
like my events better than yours.

12:21.626 --> 12:26.171
What are you talking about?
People love my events!

12:26.306 --> 12:28.674
I hate your events!

12:28.834 --> 12:30.039
Ya clod!

12:30.126 --> 12:32.064
Is she just following me around?

12:32.151 --> 12:35.053
I tried telling you,
these people are edgy.

12:35.140 --> 12:38.303
And sadly, you have no edge.

12:38.390 --> 12:39.427
No edge?

12:39.514 --> 12:42.271
No edge?
Oh, ho, ho.

12:42.358 --> 12:45.606
I have got edge, sister.
I've got so much edge,

12:45.693 --> 12:47.895
that, well,
you would fall off of me,

12:47.982 --> 12:49.572
if you're not careful.

12:52.881 --> 12:55.922
Because I'm edgy, you'd fall...
Trust me, it adds up.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.046
You'll get it.

12:57.133 --> 13:00.908
Look, can we just keep
this argument focused, please?

13:01.313 --> 13:02.453
What argument?

13:02.540 --> 13:04.729
My events are
just plain awesome,

13:04.816 --> 13:07.949
and yours are just... plain.

13:08.595 --> 13:11.160
Really? Really?
Well, you know what?

13:11.247 --> 13:13.405
Let me handle
the Gopher Grab tomorrow,

13:13.492 --> 13:19.194
because I am gonna hold
the craziest, edgiest grab ever!

13:23.508 --> 13:25.277
Boo!

13:37.655 --> 13:41.282
Whew! Boy, is it ever frosty
between those two.

13:42.864 --> 13:45.350
Well, you're right,
I should do something about it.

13:45.872 --> 13:47.660
The problem is,
when people don't get along,

13:47.747 --> 13:49.641
Blondie's the one
who normally fixes it,

13:49.728 --> 13:53.467
and she usually does it
in some unique and artful way.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.450
That's it!

13:55.568 --> 13:58.014
Max! Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

13:58.872 --> 14:00.305
Ha-ha! Perfect!

14:00.392 --> 14:04.577
Oh, Eugene, you unique
and artful devil, you!

14:16.724 --> 14:19.163
What? Not edgy enough?

14:21.499 --> 14:26.288
I just wanted to say...
I'm impressed.

14:27.716 --> 14:29.419
But...

14:30.372 --> 14:33.631
Well, well, well, looks
like you two are partners!

14:33.724 --> 14:36.006
Now you have
to work things out.

14:36.611 --> 14:40.834
- You're welcome.
- Eugene, we can't do this!

14:42.853 --> 14:45.068
Are you damaged, Fitzherbert?

14:45.155 --> 14:47.785
Well, if by that, you mean,
this is a brilliant way

14:47.872 --> 14:50.903
to force you two to work it out,
then, yes, color me damaged.

14:50.990 --> 14:54.092
If not,
this was clearly Max's idea.

14:55.349 --> 14:57.757
What do you boys
got in there?

14:57.950 --> 15:00.250
A gopher, obviously!

15:00.337 --> 15:01.580
I've named him Snoozy,

15:01.667 --> 15:05.194
because he's been sleepin'
ever since we caught him.

15:05.281 --> 15:06.767
Isn't that right?

15:09.638 --> 15:12.267
You better get it outta here
before you wake it up.

15:12.354 --> 15:14.118
Why? What is it?

15:22.726 --> 15:25.569
Grab that gopher.

15:30.575 --> 15:33.532
- What... What is it?
- It's a gopher!

15:33.696 --> 15:36.280
Mm, this is bad.

15:38.419 --> 15:39.881
We should probably run.

15:42.302 --> 15:44.051
Uh-oh.

15:49.319 --> 15:51.950
So,
that's a sneezeweasel.

15:52.037 --> 15:53.804
Well, it ain't a gopher.

16:00.621 --> 16:02.520
We gotta do something!

16:13.745 --> 16:17.105
Oh! That's why it's called
a sneezeweasel, huh?

16:18.750 --> 16:20.485
Whoa!

16:23.995 --> 16:26.615
Oh! Quick! That wall!

16:34.298 --> 16:37.958
You guys really undersold
this Gopher Grab thing.

16:38.045 --> 16:41.092
No! We didn't!
Because that is not a gopher!

16:41.179 --> 16:42.325
- Huh?
- Say what?

16:42.412 --> 16:45.070
You brought us the wrong animal!
Come on!

16:48.111 --> 16:50.193
Oh! Oh! Oh!

16:50.280 --> 16:52.306
Pointy! Pointy! All the points!

16:52.912 --> 16:54.147
Snoozy!

16:54.293 --> 16:55.698
Why?

17:04.127 --> 17:06.221
Get 'em girls!

17:07.065 --> 17:08.310
All right, ugly!

17:08.397 --> 17:09.890
Prepare to eat rope!

17:13.002 --> 17:14.005
Quaid!

17:25.778 --> 17:28.704
- We have to stop the sneezeweasel!
- We've gotta save Captain Quaid!

17:29.648 --> 17:31.497
All right, this is ridiculous.

17:31.584 --> 17:32.970
We have to work together.

17:33.057 --> 17:37.079
Eugene, you guys get Quaid,
we'll get the sneezeweasel.

17:39.531 --> 17:41.681
Come on, the sheriff needs us!

17:42.767 --> 17:45.593
Don't worry, kid!
We got this!

17:50.708 --> 17:54.095
Okay, we may not...
actually have this.

18:00.383 --> 18:02.275
You thought that was a gopher?

18:02.362 --> 18:05.590
Me... Me?
You drew him as big as a tree!

18:05.677 --> 18:08.533
Oh, it's called perspective.
Those trees are in the background!

18:08.620 --> 18:10.751
Uh... Eugene!

18:13.263 --> 18:14.265
Oh, boy.

18:18.259 --> 18:20.542
Hey! Pricklepuss!

18:22.773 --> 18:24.549
His name's Snoozy!

18:25.264 --> 18:27.221
You ready to run?

18:28.712 --> 18:29.815
Now!

18:35.953 --> 18:40.195
Okay, I'm sort of regretting my
whole edgy thing right about now.

18:40.282 --> 18:42.117
I know
how we can get across.

18:43.683 --> 18:45.204
Cass, no.

18:46.998 --> 18:51.982
Cass, this might not be the
best time, but... I'm sorry.

18:52.069 --> 18:55.720
- I was acting like a...
- Sore loser? Crybaby? Jerk?

18:55.807 --> 18:59.099
Wow! Okay. You had those
at the ready, didn't you?

19:00.243 --> 19:01.679
Jump!

19:04.447 --> 19:07.632
But you're right!
This is all my fault!

19:07.719 --> 19:10.862
Okay, well, Lance and Hook
Foot had a part in it, too.

19:10.949 --> 19:12.069
In fairness,

19:12.156 --> 19:15.337
you let Eugene assign them
the task of getting the gophers.

19:17.627 --> 19:20.205
But, hey, I could have
done things differently, too.

19:20.292 --> 19:22.243
I'm sorry I got so competitive.

19:22.507 --> 19:23.766
And mean.

19:26.937 --> 19:29.196
- Come on!
- Whoa!

19:41.271 --> 19:43.316
Cass, look.

20:11.883 --> 20:16.399
Next time, the princess
draws the picture.

20:17.821 --> 20:19.452
Don't worry, big fella.

20:19.539 --> 20:21.946
I'll make sure you get back
into the woods.

20:22.034 --> 20:23.428
Nice plan, Raps.

20:23.515 --> 20:25.649
You came up
with the Shorty Toss.

20:25.736 --> 20:28.423
I just stole
your bad idea.

20:29.031 --> 20:33.311
Cass, I couldn't have asked for a
better person to be chained to.

20:33.398 --> 20:34.587
Me neither.

20:34.929 --> 20:36.799
Eugene, where's the key?

20:36.886 --> 20:40.556
Whoa! Unchain us now,
Fitzherbert!

20:44.640 --> 20:47.413
So, you're really leaving us, huh?

20:47.500 --> 20:51.897
Yeah! I'm sure people around here
are gonna be sad to see me go.

20:51.984 --> 20:56.101
Oh, I don't know, I think they were
startin' to take a shine to you.

20:56.188 --> 21:00.255
- Really?
- No. They still don't like you.

21:01.820 --> 21:03.361
But that doesn't matter.

21:03.448 --> 21:07.540
Vardaros is a better town
because you came through it.

21:08.824 --> 21:10.649
Thank you, Princess.

21:12.076 --> 21:14.032
I wanna hug you, but...

21:14.119 --> 21:17.366
Eww! No, no, no.
We're not hugging.

21:17.453 --> 21:20.319
Well, Rapunzel, I don't know
what you're going to find

21:20.406 --> 21:22.645
at the end of this path
you've set out on,

21:22.732 --> 21:26.306
but whatever it is,
I hope it's what you're lookin' for.

21:26.393 --> 21:28.017
Thanks, Cap.

21:28.301 --> 21:29.441
And who knows?

21:29.528 --> 21:31.984
Maybe I'll come back
and visit someday.

21:32.071 --> 21:35.672
I hate you,
and everything you stand for!

21:35.759 --> 21:37.102
