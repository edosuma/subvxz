and then 159 others
seemed to catch it.

And the school couldn't
control it. In fact,

12:31.925 --> 12:33.883

the worse it got.

12:33.927 --> 12:35.842
It spread to three villages

12:35.885 --> 12:37.800
Why?

12:37.844 --> 12:39.019
There were a lot of theories.

12:39.062 --> 12:40.498
Emotions are contagious,

12:40.542 --> 12:43.023
so many believe it to be
an extreme emotional contagion.

Nothing.

I mean, nothing
in Western medicine.

Well, there was
a dancing plague in 1518.

12:56.863 --> 12:59.213
400 people in France
could not stop dancing.

12:59.256 --> 13:02.782

they're forcing me to shut down

Even if they could
force you to take it down,

37:35.818 --> 37:38.473
And now how many do you have?
Two million.

37:38.517 --> 37:40.388
Let's not lose track of that.

37:40.432 --> 37:41.824
I won't.
Good.

37:41.868 --> 37:43.522
Now, here's what you're
going to do.

37:43.565 --> 37:45.437
Take down the site
and apologize.

37:45.480 --> 37:47.221
What? But that's what they want.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.353
And that's what they'll get.

37:50.485 --> 37:52.661
[chuckles]

37:52.705 --> 37:55.273
In 1785,
the king of France found

37:55.316 --> 37:57.187
that potatoes were
the most economical way

37:57.231 --> 37:58.493
to feed the peasantry.

37:58.537 --> 38:02.454
The problem was
peasants hated potatoes.

38:02.497 --> 38:05.283
So the king has his servants
build a big brick wall,

38:05.326 --> 38:10.244
and behind it he plants potatoes
in his secret garden.

38:10.288 --> 38:14.640
The peasants grow curious
and then upset.

38:14.683 --> 38:16.381
They climb over the wall
and steal

38:16.424 --> 38:19.122
all the food planted there.

38:19.166 --> 38:21.647
And that's how potatoes
became a staple

38:21.690 --> 38:24.040
of the French peasantry.

38:26.956 --> 38:28.697
What does that mean?

38:31.309 --> 38:35.574
The forbidden is
always desirable.

I'm better than this.

One of my producers
uploaded my challenge online

38:54.027 --> 38:57.465
and added something.

38:57.509 --> 39:00.947
Something that can
make it dangerous.

39:00.990 --> 39:03.732
I don't want any trouble
with the police or anything,

39:03.776 --> 39:07.040
so I'm gonna take it down
by the end of the day.

39:07.083 --> 39:11.174

don't share this video.

39:48.908 --> 39:51.301

tell you everything.

39:51.345 --> 39:52.607
Okay.

39:54.653 --> 39:57.612

I slept with a woman...

anything anymore.
