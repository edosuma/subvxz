Be good.

I was with the Secretary
since he's been Governor of Connecticut.

10:56.613 --> 10:58.241
I came to Washington with him.

10:58.824 --> 11:01.286
I moved here
because I was dedicated to his career.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.579
I trusted the man.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.165
And then he fucked me.

11:06.708 --> 11:07.625
He what?

11:07.876 --> 11:09.169
No, I didn't have sex with him.

11:09.252 --> 11:11.920
I should say, <i>I </i>didn't have sex with him,

11:12.005 --> 11:13.173
but somebody sure did.

11:13.589 --> 11:15.884
It was about to come out,
so he resigned.

11:16.425 --> 11:19.512
But because I was hired
from outside the government pool,

11:19.846 --> 11:21.848
I don't get conveyed
to the next secretary,

11:21.930 --> 11:23.057
so now I'm out a job.

11:24.934 --> 11:27.270
Because he couldn't
keep his hands off women.

11:29.606 --> 11:30.814
Do you have proof?

11:30.982 --> 11:32.942
He thinks he was being so clever.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.237
He had a private phone line
installed in his office.

11:36.695 --> 11:38.363
Nobody else could answer it.

11:38.615 --> 11:39.781
I picked it up once.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.702
Said hello, and it's nobody home.

11:43.286 --> 11:45.038
It rings, he shuts the door.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.040
Why not hang a sign?

11:47.915 --> 11:49.041
Do you have a name?

for talking to the press.

11:55.339 --> 11:57.634
I can feel it. I can feel it.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.637
I name a name
and get someone into trouble.

12:00.762 --> 12:01.846
So you do have a name.

12:02.262 --> 12:03.180
Just a first name.

12:03.264 --> 12:05.391
Oh, my God. I'm going to say it.

12:05.934 --> 12:07.017
Ellie.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.563
Ellie. Nothing else?

12:11.146 --> 12:13.483
I think the President knows about it too.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.901
Overheard the Secretary
talking to him about her.

13:01.781 --> 13:02.991
How you doing?

13:03.616 --> 13:04.742
Can I help you?

13:05.367 --> 13:07.120
Well, actually,
we're looking for your mom.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.621
Is she around?

13:09.038 --> 13:10.747
My mom's sick. She's not here.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.002
Gosh, I love boats.
Are you going on a trip?

13:15.545 --> 13:16.629
Yeah.

13:17.255 --> 13:19.132
That's exciting. Looks like a...

13:20.049 --> 13:21.884
Like a long trip, huh?

13:23.553 --> 13:25.346
So, listen, do you know
where you're going?

13:25.637 --> 13:27.348
[Rittenhouse]
She's going back to the house.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.559
Hey, you want to stop that?

13:30.267 --> 13:31.728
Lily, please?

13:32.270 --> 13:33.646
Lily, that's a pretty name.

13:35.064 --> 13:38.276
Lily. Do as I say. Go on.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.069
If we could just get
a minute of your time.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.697
What do you want from me?

13:42.947 --> 13:45.241
We'd like to talk about your resignation.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.577
My wife is sick. She's in the hospital.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.911
That's why I resigned.
Everybody knows this.

13:50.413 --> 13:53.833
We could talk about your wife,
or we could just talk about Ellie.

14:07.512 --> 14:08.890
Turn the camera off.

14:09.598 --> 14:11.601
If you want to talk to me, turn it off.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.019
[softly] Cut it.

14:14.728 --> 14:16.064
We know everything.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.939
Nobody knows everything.

14:18.565 --> 14:21.736
Well, we know about
the secret phone lines

14:21.819 --> 14:24.322
and the whispered calls to the President,

14:24.655 --> 14:26.240
and about a Secretary of the Treasury

14:26.324 --> 14:28.575
who's kept his entire
department in the dark

14:28.700 --> 14:30.036
about what he's really doing,

14:30.118 --> 14:33.539
about a cover story about his resignation
that just fell through.

14:33.622 --> 14:35.833
I mean, sir, you want me to go on?

14:36.751 --> 14:38.461
And you're just gonna break it?

14:39.837 --> 14:41.923
Well, that's what we do for a living.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.092
Well, congratulations.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.011
You now have
the biggest story in history.

14:47.469 --> 14:48.762
Good luck to you.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.183
Personally, I think it's a mistake
to run the story,

14:52.266 --> 14:53.642
but, hey, what the hell?

14:54.435 --> 14:55.520
Why not?

14:57.146 --> 14:59.314
What difference
does anything make anymore?

15:05.780 --> 15:06.738
Look.

15:07.949 --> 15:09.659
I know you're just a reporter,

15:10.742 --> 15:13.579
but you used to be a person, right?

15:19.544 --> 15:21.795
I wanted to be with my family.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.259
Can you understand that?

15:47.447 --> 15:50.574
Okay, Secretary of the Treasury
Alan Rittenhouse

15:50.657 --> 15:53.202
resigns because of a mistress named Ellie.

15:53.743 --> 15:55.913
The biggest story in history?

15:55.997 --> 15:58.290
[scoffs] What an ego.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.793
Now, if it was the President...

16:01.461 --> 16:02.377
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.131
Okay, the President
has a mistress named Ellie,

16:05.214 --> 16:07.257
and Rittenhouse pretends
that he's having the affair

16:07.341 --> 16:08.968
and takes the fall and resigns,

16:09.050 --> 16:12.180
and the President buys him a yacht?

16:12.472 --> 16:13.430
[groans]

16:13.514 --> 16:15.141
Son of a bitch.

16:21.731 --> 16:22.689
Oh, shit.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.942
Oh, shit.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.527
Right! Okay, okay!

16:28.069 --> 16:30.363
Oh, God. No, God.

16:51.968 --> 16:53.471
FBI. If you would, please, ma'am.

16:53.554 --> 16:55.389
-What do I do with my car?
-We'll take care of your car.

16:55.473 --> 16:56.681
Just step back to my car.

16:56.973 --> 16:58.476
-Get her car here.
-Got it.

17:05.816 --> 17:06.900
[FBI agent] Let's go.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.029
[tires screeching]

17:20.623 --> 17:22.124
Would you come this way please?

17:36.222 --> 17:38.224
Morton Entrekin, Miss Lerner.

17:39.767 --> 17:42.520
I'm expected back at MSNBC at 6:00.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.106
I think I should be there.

17:45.313 --> 17:47.483
People knew about
the Manhattan Project, you know,

17:47.858 --> 17:49.360
and they kept it a secret.

17:51.028 --> 17:53.739
That was just the creation
of the atom bomb.

17:54.115 --> 17:55.323
[chuckles nervously]

18:02.956 --> 18:04.041
Hmm.

18:09.046 --> 18:11.257
[door opening]

18:22.101 --> 18:24.020
Miss Lerner, Tom Beck.

18:24.352 --> 18:26.522
I understand you've come
into some information.

18:26.813 --> 18:29.358
Miss Lerner was just expressing
her lack of enthusiasm

18:29.442 --> 18:30.943
for matters of national security

18:31.027 --> 18:33.863
where journalistic competitiveness
is at stake.

18:35.197 --> 18:39.409
Mr. President, I'm not interested
in using Ellie to further my career.

18:39.994 --> 18:41.495
What do you know about E.L.E.?

18:44.415 --> 18:47.960
I know you should have picked
a better cover story than a sick wife.

18:48.336 --> 18:50.588
See? What did I tell you?

18:53.174 --> 18:55.216
We'd always thought
the deadline for going public

18:55.342 --> 18:56.719
was the publication of the budget,

18:56.802 --> 18:59.429
since we've spent
more money than we can hide.

18:59.764 --> 19:01.599
The budget comes out in two weeks.

19:02.308 --> 19:05.519
I don't suppose I could convince you
to sit on this for two weeks.

19:07.521 --> 19:10.483
No such thing as two weeks
in the news business.

19:10.608 --> 19:13.903
And I can't appeal to your sense of
what's in the nation's best interest?

19:15.196 --> 19:18.658
I always thought the truth
was in the nation's best interest.

19:21.869 --> 19:23.204
[Entrekin] You want to hold her?

19:25.873 --> 19:28.084
[President Beck]
What if we go public in 48 hours?

19:28.376 --> 19:29.668
Now, that's doable, isn't it?

19:30.336 --> 19:32.171
[Entrekin] That would be
very difficult, Mr. President.

19:32.254 --> 19:35.466
[President Beck] Morton,
if she knows, how long can it be

19:35.549 --> 19:38.010
before CNN or <i>The Post</i> breaks the story?

19:39.011 --> 19:42.556
This was never gonna be a secret
as long as you wanted it to be.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.101
Give us two days, Miss Lerner.

19:46.185 --> 19:49.688
You'll get second-row center
at the White House press conference.

19:49.772 --> 19:51.857
Now, from what I know of your career,
that's a promotion.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.109
I want exclusivity.

19:53.525 --> 19:54.944
Now, listen, young lady.

19:55.903 --> 19:57.905
This is a presidential favor.

19:58.572 --> 20:01.200
I'm letting you go
because I don't want another headache.

20:01.617 --> 20:04.870
And I'm trusting you because I know
what this can do for your career.

20:05.995 --> 20:08.999
It might seem that we have each other
over the same barrel, Miss Lerner,

20:09.082 --> 20:11.460
but it just seems that way.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.634
-I want the--
-"Want"?

20:22.053 --> 20:23.097
May I...

20:24.223 --> 20:25.975
May I have the first question?

20:27.851 --> 20:29.562
We'll see you Tuesday, Miss Lerner.

20:35.650 --> 20:36.902
[sighs]

20:53.418 --> 20:55.713
Come on, come on.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.428
[sighs]

21:07.308 --> 21:10.351
E.L.E., E.L.E. E...

21:17.485 --> 21:18.819
Paleontology.

21:18.903 --> 21:22.114
Paleontology. What's paleontology
have to do with anything?

21:23.072 --> 21:26.202
Come on. Come on, come on.

21:45.929 --> 21:47.598
-[Beth] Hey.
-Hey.

21:47.681 --> 21:49.265
-Look who's working late.
-Yep.

21:49.642 --> 21:50.810
How's Rittenhouse going?

21:51.018 --> 21:52.645
Uh, no sign of the wife yet.

21:52.937 --> 21:55.397
-Is she missing?
-No. We're still working on it.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.191
-We'll get there.
-I know, it's a dull story.

21:57.274 --> 21:59.693
I promise you, next time
we'll get you something more exciting.

22:01.110 --> 22:02.029
Great.

22:02.612 --> 22:04.072
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

22:04.447 --> 22:05.741
Want to come to dinner with us?

22:05.825 --> 22:08.369
I can't, I can't. I got... I have plans.

22:08.619 --> 22:10.245
Oh, okay. Well, we'll see you tomorrow.

22:20.798 --> 22:22.591
-[man] This is your table.
-[Jenny] Thank you.

22:22.716 --> 22:24.426
[piano playing]

22:26.553 --> 22:27.972
[Jason] Ah, here she is.

22:29.098 --> 22:30.515
Jenny.

22:33.769 --> 22:34.770
Hi, Chloe.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.563
[waiter] Would you like
some champagne, miss?

22:36.647 --> 22:37.898
Martini, up.

22:38.566 --> 22:39.567
Big.

22:40.525 --> 22:41.652
[waiter] Good.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.196
I missed you.

22:44.487 --> 22:46.698
I mean, we missed you yesterday.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.451
I must say, I'm...

22:50.828 --> 22:53.371
I'm disturbed that
you didn't come to our wedding.

22:53.455 --> 22:55.331
Jason, you promised.

22:55.456 --> 22:56.917
I know I promised,

22:57.001 --> 22:59.336
but it was a beautiful event,
and I missed her.

22:59.962 --> 23:00.879
You should have been there.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.173
The twins, they were
running around like mad

23:03.256 --> 23:04.800
and throwing flowers.

23:05.301 --> 23:07.093
It was wonderful, especially Emma.

23:07.177 --> 23:09.638
You know, the little one.
She loves you.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.432
-It was beautiful.
-She adores you. Yes.

23:11.514 --> 23:13.016
-She missed you too.
-All right.

23:15.226 --> 23:16.937
This is from us for you.

23:22.150 --> 23:23.819
Are you not going to open it?

23:36.248 --> 23:37.917
[breathing heavily]

23:42.254 --> 23:44.048
[whispering] I knew she wouldn't...

23:44.298 --> 23:46.800
You can exchange them
if you don't like them.

23:48.260 --> 23:51.179
Jenny, I know this is hard.
I just want you to be happy.

23:51.639 --> 23:52.723
Happy.

23:53.599 --> 23:54.725
Well...

23:54.808 --> 23:57.645
I would like to propose
a toast to happiness,

23:58.395 --> 23:59.562
and to...

24:05.778 --> 24:07.696
Mmm. Mmm.

24:11.783 --> 24:14.119
Well, are we going to have
an evening or not?

24:14.912 --> 24:16.664
Jenny, I know that you hate me.

24:17.206 --> 24:20.167
I know that you have terrible things
that you want to say to me.

24:21.001 --> 24:22.211
You have to get over it.

24:22.543 --> 24:24.004
Life goes on.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.130
Life goes on? Okay.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.300
[laughing]

24:29.927 --> 24:31.095
What's so funny?

24:31.637 --> 24:32.721
Life...

24:35.349 --> 24:37.184
[laughing] We'll see.

24:38.101 --> 24:39.645
What's so funny about "life goes on"?

24:41.562 --> 24:43.524
What? Life going on?

24:43.607 --> 24:45.484
I don't think it's funny
that life goes on.

24:45.859 --> 24:49.112
Dad, you need
to get back together with Mom.

24:50.322 --> 24:53.450
She's all alone in the world,
and she needs you right now.

24:53.533 --> 24:54.743
Okay?

24:56.995 --> 24:58.121
Jenny.

24:58.871 --> 24:59.999
I just got married.

25:00.081 --> 25:01.375
I know, I know, and I'm sorry.

25:01.457 --> 25:03.460
Chloe, this has nothing to do with you.

25:03.752 --> 25:06.922
[Jason] Well, it has to do something
for me, for Christ's sake.

25:07.505 --> 25:09.174
This is insane.

25:09.258 --> 25:11.843
I have to apologize for my daughter.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.345
-[laughing]
-It's not your fault.

25:14.221 --> 25:15.806
All right, I have to go.

25:16.557 --> 25:18.851
I know you think
I'm a bad person. I'm really not.

25:19.309 --> 25:21.102
And I don't hate you.

25:21.186 --> 25:23.605
I gotta... I just... I gotta go.

25:27.192 --> 25:31.362
[reporters speaking in foreign language]

25:38.412 --> 25:40.164
[people chattering]

25:47.420 --> 25:49.505
[Beth] She's done exactly
what we want her to do.

25:49.590 --> 25:51.716
She signed the release,
and so you have no problem.

25:51.884 --> 25:54.636
Because for her, it does... Excuse me.

25:55.095 --> 25:57.181
-Jenny.
-Hey. How are you?

25:57.264 --> 25:59.265
-What are you doing here?
-Excuse me. Sorry.

25:59.600 --> 26:00.516
Uh, yeah.

26:00.601 --> 26:02.226
Did Stuart send you here
without telling me?

26:02.311 --> 26:04.312
No. Beth. I was gonna talk to you...

26:04.396 --> 26:06.857
If Stuart thinks he can push me
out of the White House...

26:06.939 --> 26:08.649
Miss Lerner. Hi, Beth.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.904
Right this way.
I've got you right down here.

26:18.202 --> 26:19.495
Excuse me, please.

26:21.830 --> 26:22.915
Okay.

26:23.331 --> 26:25.958
He'll find you for the first question.
Then you're on your own.

26:27.961 --> 26:29.420
Hey, how are you? Yeah.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.758
[press secretary] Ladies and gentlemen.

26:33.050 --> 26:35.177
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

26:36.345 --> 26:38.931
The President will begin
by addressing the nation.

26:39.389 --> 26:41.766
Please hold your questions
until he's finished his remarks.

26:42.476 --> 26:45.312
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

26:49.566 --> 26:50.525
Hello, everybody.

26:50.609 --> 26:51.944
[reporters] Hello, Mr. President.

26:52.026 --> 26:53.736
[man] Ten seconds, Mr. President.

26:56.072 --> 26:57.616
Five, four.

27:00.494 --> 27:01.495
Good evening.

27:03.121 --> 27:04.289
A few minutes ago,

27:04.372 --> 27:06.875
the United States' ambassadors
to every country in the world

27:07.000 --> 27:10.212
told the leaders of those nations
what I am about to tell you.

27:10.838 --> 27:13.423
It's a bit complicated,
so it will take some time.

27:13.506 --> 27:15.259
So I hope you will bear with me,

27:15.466 --> 27:16.717
hear what I have to say.

27:18.387 --> 27:20.179
A little over a year ago,

27:20.930 --> 27:24.893
two American astronomers,
Marcus Wolf and Leo Biederman,

27:25.310 --> 27:27.562
working on a mountain top in Arizona,

27:27.646 --> 27:29.982
-Shh. Nobody say anything.
<i>-saw something in the night sky</i>

27:30.107 --> 27:31.649
<i>that caused them great concern.</i>

27:33.025 --> 27:34.319
<i>A comet.</i>

27:35.736 --> 27:39.032
<i>But the comet was, well...</i>

27:39.408 --> 27:42.910
There was a remote possibility
that the comet was on a path

27:42.995 --> 27:46.372
that could bring it into
direct contact with the Earth.

27:46.456 --> 27:48.250
[crowd murmuring]

27:49.001 --> 27:53.088
Now, we get hit all the time
by rocks and meteors,

27:53.172 --> 27:55.966
some of them the size of cars,
some no bigger than your hand.

27:56.550 --> 27:59.595
But the comet we discovered
is the size of New York City.

27:59.970 --> 28:02.973
From the north side
of Central Park to the Battery.

28:03.639 --> 28:05.475
About seven miles long.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.436
Put another way,

28:08.352 --> 28:10.313
this comet is larger than Mount Everest.

28:11.398 --> 28:14.818
It weighs 500 billion tons.

28:15.276 --> 28:16.485
<i>Now, chances are...</i>

28:17.361 --> 28:20.948
Astrophysicists, geologists
and climatologists.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.576
Where the hell is science?

28:22.658 --> 28:25.537
Paris, London, Tokyo, Tel Aviv.
I want it everywhere.

28:25.620 --> 28:27.121
Get the Hale-Bopp stand-ups.

28:27.496 --> 28:29.666
And graphics! I need graphics!

28:29.750 --> 28:32.084
[President Beck]
<i>Comets begin far out in space.</i>

28:32.418 --> 28:33.754
<i>They're what's left over</i>

28:33.837 --> 28:35.589
<i>from the creation of the solar system</i>

28:35.672 --> 28:38.591
<i>after the planets were formed</i>
<i>billions of years ago.</i>

28:38.675 --> 28:40.552
<i>Now, these chunks of space debris</i>

28:40.636 --> 28:43.138
<i>are in an elongated orbit around our sun.</i>

28:43.222 --> 28:44.889
<i>But every now and then</i>

28:44.973 --> 28:46.308
one of them gets bumped,

28:46.390 --> 28:49.227
sort of like a billiard ball
on a pool table,

28:49.311 --> 28:51.230
and is knocked into a different orbit.

28:51.312 --> 28:54.566
Now, if this comet continues
on its path around the sun

28:54.649 --> 28:56.485
and keeps its present course,

28:56.860 --> 28:59.905
sometime on August 16th,
roughly a year from now,

29:00.155 --> 29:02.241
there's a chance
that we might have impact.

29:04.033 --> 29:07.245
So for the past eight months,
the United States and Russia

29:07.579 --> 29:10.874
have been building the largest
spaceship ever constructed.

29:11.792 --> 29:13.918
It's being built in orbit
around the Earth.

29:14.336 --> 29:16.463
And we call it the <i>Messiah.</i>

29:17.172 --> 29:20.007
And right now, a team
of American astronauts and one Russian

29:20.091 --> 29:21.885
are at Cape Canaveral in Florida.

29:21.968 --> 29:25.304
In two months, they will leave
on the shuttle Atlantis

29:25.472 --> 29:26.764
to board the<i> Messiah.</i>

29:27.432 --> 29:31.061
This is the crew that will stop the comet.

29:32.521 --> 29:34.563
<i>I'd like the world to meet</i>
<i>some extraordinary people.</i>

29:34.856 --> 29:37.359
<i>First is Mission Commander Oren Monash.</i>

29:37.442 --> 29:39.903
<i>Commander, would you</i>
<i>introduce us to your team?</i>

29:40.236 --> 29:41.571
I'd be honored, sir.

29:42.697 --> 29:44.241
Pilot Andrea Baker.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.119
Medical officer Gus Partenza.

29:47.577 --> 29:52.124
From Russia, nuclear specialist
Colonel Mikhail Tulchinsky.

29:52.666 --> 29:54.126
Navigator Mark Simon,

29:54.208 --> 29:56.837
and rendezvous pilot
Spurgeon Tanner.

29:57.087 --> 29:59.548
[all] Hello, Mr. President.

29:59.923 --> 30:03.510
<i>Captain Tanner,</i>
<i>you flew six shuttle missions.</i>

30:03.592 --> 30:05.846
<i>You were the last man to walk</i>
<i>on the moon, weren't you, sir?</i>

30:05.928 --> 30:07.347
Yes, sir, but...

30:07.680 --> 30:09.725
<i>Oren here will be doing</i>
<i>most of the flying on this one.</i>

30:09.808 --> 30:12.936
<i>I'll just be taking us down</i>
<i>to the comet's surface.</i>

30:13.020 --> 30:14.562
Well, it's good to know
we're going to have

30:14.646 --> 30:16.523
your kind of experience up there, Captain.

30:16.648 --> 30:17.524
[Tanner] <i>Thank you, sir.</i>

30:17.607 --> 30:20.401
<i>Godspeed to you all.</i>
<i>We're counting on you.</i>

30:21.069 --> 30:22.029
Thank you, sir.

30:22.111 --> 30:24.947
Got Beijing, Rome,
Sao Paulo, Cairo, Berlin!

30:25.032 --> 30:27.576
Does anyone know how big the one was
that killed all the dinosaurs?

30:27.658 --> 30:30.245
Something majestic, mysterious,
with a fanfare for the intro

30:30.370 --> 30:31.620
and a theme to the longer promos.

30:31.705 --> 30:33.415
It's hitting the goddamn Earth?

30:33.497 --> 30:34.957
That's what he's saying.
Bring that up again.

30:35.042 --> 30:36.709
He'll scare the shit out of everybody.

30:36.793 --> 30:39.129
[President Beck] <i>We will not tolerate</i>
<i>any disruption of our way of life.</i>

30:39.212 --> 30:41.630
Our society will continue as normal.

30:41.881 --> 30:43.507
Work will go on.

30:44.091 --> 30:45.217
You will pay your bills.

30:45.302 --> 30:46.636
[reporters chuckling]

30:48.929 --> 30:50.389
There will be no hoarding.

30:51.558 --> 30:53.518
There will be no sudden profiteering.

30:53.894 --> 30:57.356
I'm freezing all wages, all prices.

30:57.647 --> 31:00.274
What a bottle of water cost you yesterday,

31:01.485 --> 31:03.028
It will cost you tomorrow.

31:04.111 --> 31:05.488
Now we'll take a few questions.

31:05.572 --> 31:06.990
[reporters clamoring]

31:07.366 --> 31:09.076
-Miss Lerner.
-[clears throat]

31:09.909 --> 31:12.870
[clears throat] Uh, Jenny Lerner, MSNBC.

31:12.954 --> 31:14.206
Jenny Lerner?

31:14.289 --> 31:15.831
Son of a bitch.

31:15.916 --> 31:19.086
<i>Um, Mr. President,</i>

31:19.168 --> 31:21.504
<i>why wasn't this announcement</i>
<i>made sooner?</i>

31:21.922 --> 31:24.341
Well, until we knew
we could build the rocket

31:24.424 --> 31:26.717
and the comet could be intercepted,

31:26.802 --> 31:28.887
we saw no reason to alarm the planet.

31:28.970 --> 31:30.930
[reporters clamoring]

31:32.057 --> 31:33.683
Do you have another question, Miss Lerner?

31:34.141 --> 31:35.435
Yeah. Um...

31:36.019 --> 31:39.106
<i>Is...is there a connection</i>
<i>between the comet</i>

31:39.188 --> 31:42.067
<i>and the recall of American</i>
<i>troops from abroad?</i>

31:42.149 --> 31:44.110
[President Beck] <i>Our fighting men</i>
<i>and women are coming home</i>

31:44.194 --> 31:45.654
<i>because we felt it prudent,</i>

31:45.736 --> 31:47.488
<i>in light of domestic security concerns,</i>

31:47.613 --> 31:49.198
<i>to have them available.</i>

31:49.282 --> 31:51.201
<i>Although I certainly hope</i>
<i>we don't need to use them.</i>

31:51.283 --> 31:52.744
<i>-Next question.</i>
-[reporters clamoring]

31:53.453 --> 31:55.205
Actually, Mr. President, if...

31:55.455 --> 31:58.291
Just one final question, sir. Um...

31:59.000 --> 32:02.963
MSNBC has learned
that Secretary Rittenhouse

32:03.045 --> 32:06.341
did not leave for the reasons
announced by your administration.

32:06.966 --> 32:09.511
In fact, isn't it true, sir,

32:09.928 --> 32:11.972
that not everyone
in your administration

32:12.054 --> 32:15.015
is convinced
that the <i>Messiah </i>will save us?

32:24.067 --> 32:26.778
Secretary Rittenhouse
served his country with full devotion.

32:28.196 --> 32:30.197
He resigned for personal reasons.

32:30.740 --> 32:34.034
Now, I can promise you this,
Miss Lerner, all of you,

32:34.535 --> 32:36.913
everyone in this room
and everyone listening to my voice,

32:36.996 --> 32:39.374
that at some point
over the next ten months,

32:40.458 --> 32:44.295
all of us will entertain
our worst fears and concerns.

32:45.589 --> 32:47.631
But I can also promise you this.

32:48.966 --> 32:50.342
Life will go on.

32:52.303 --> 32:53.472
We will prevail.

32:54.305 --> 32:55.932
-Mr. President! Please!
-[reporters shouting]

32:56.015 --> 32:57.184
-[President Beck] Sally.
-Sir.

32:57.266 --> 32:59.269
Sir, what is the comet's name?

32:59.351 --> 33:01.062
The two scientists who found the comet

33:01.146 --> 33:02.355
were killed in a car crash

33:02.438 --> 33:05.524
while racing from their observatory
to alert the world.

33:05.609 --> 33:06.943
<i>So we named it for them.</i>

33:07.235 --> 33:08.570
<i>Wolf-Biederman.</i>

33:08.977 --> 33:11.572
[chuckles] Leo Biederman,
they said it again.

33:11.697 --> 33:13.199
-Shh!
-Leo, is he talking about you?

33:13.283 --> 33:14.658
-He is, isn't he?
-I'm trying to listen.

33:14.743 --> 33:16.660
-[phone rings]
<i>-Why were the Russians brought...</i>

33:16.745 --> 33:18.288
-[doorbell rings]
-Can you get that, please?

33:18.370 --> 33:19.497
Janie, get the door.

33:20.456 --> 33:22.751
[President Beck] <i>Well, we have</i>
<i>the technology to build the ship.</i>

33:23.834 --> 33:25.837
<i>They have the technology to make it go.</i>

33:25.920 --> 33:27.923
There's someone at the door for you, Leo.

33:28.005 --> 33:30.466

33:31.717 --> 33:34.763
[newscaster] <i>You've been watching</i>
<i>live coverage of President Tom Beck...</i>

33:34.846 --> 33:37.432
I can't believe this. This is so weird.

33:37.515 --> 33:39.141
Dr. Wolf from astronomy club?

33:39.226 --> 33:40.476
Yeah, I guess so.

33:40.894 --> 33:42.270
I think it's really neat.

33:42.395 --> 33:44.773
Nobody on our block discovered
the world was gonna end before.

33:44.898 --> 33:46.399
[Don] He's still very much alive.

33:46.483 --> 33:47.984
He's still alive, everyone.

33:48.068 --> 33:49.819
He's right here, and he's still alive.

33:49.903 --> 33:51.237
[chuckles] Okay?

33:51.530 --> 33:53.072
[boy] Hey, Leo, cool!

33:53.156 --> 33:54.658
[Leo] <i>As far as we know,</i>

33:54.741 --> 33:58.078
what happened was that Dr. Wolf
saw the comet in my photograph,

33:58.160 --> 34:00.205
so he shared the discovery with me.

34:00.705 --> 34:02.666
And then he was killed in that crash

34:02.748 --> 34:05.084
and everything got
mixed up in Washington,

34:05.168 --> 34:07.003
so the President thought I was dead too.

34:09.172 --> 34:10.089
Jasmine.

34:11.549 --> 34:13.676
How does it feel
having your name on it?

34:15.094 --> 34:16.221
I don't want anyone to think

34:16.304 --> 34:18.931
that I'm trying to take
something away from Dr. Wolf,

34:19.181 --> 34:20.391
because I'm not.

34:20.933 --> 34:22.351
But it's kind of cool.

34:24.395 --> 34:25.355
Jason.

34:27.315 --> 34:30.150
You know, you're gonna have sex
a lot more now

34:30.235 --> 34:31.527

-Don't listen. Don't.

34:40.245 --> 34:41.161
<i>Really?</i>

34:42.371 --> 34:45.292
Thank you for your sexual
insight, Mr. Thurman.

34:45.375 --> 34:46.418
You can sit down now.

34:46.500 --> 34:48.795
Famous people always get sex, Mr. Perry.

34:49.045 --> 34:51.297
That's the main reason
it's good to be famous.

34:51.380 --> 34:53.257
[crowd applauding]

35:00.098 --> 35:02.726
Fruit, a reactor. Bottle, a rocket, okay?

35:02.808 --> 35:05.103
-A nuclear reactor in space?
-Yes.

35:05.228 --> 35:06.479
Isn't that dangerous?

35:06.563 --> 35:08.815
No, no, no. This is all
Russian design. Russian science.

35:08.897 --> 35:10.942
Uh, the same people
who designed Chernobyl.

35:11.610 --> 35:12.777
[woman] Chernobyl?

35:12.861 --> 35:15.322
-Chernobyl almost worked.
-[laughing]

35:16.031 --> 35:18.533
So, what happens
after you plant the bomb?

35:18.616 --> 35:19.784
Well, we have seven hours.

35:19.868 --> 35:21.493
We're gonna put the bombs
inside the comet.

35:21.578 --> 35:23.830
I'm gonna follow these two.
I don't trust that combination.

35:23.913 --> 35:28.293
After seven hours, the 14-hour
rotational cycle of the comet spins.

35:28.375 --> 35:31.421
We're gonna get married.
God knows I want to marry you.

35:31.546 --> 35:32.881
But the day I get back,

35:33.006 --> 35:34.799
the last thing I'm gonna do
is step inside a church.

35:34.924 --> 35:36.051
I don't do churches well.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.761
'Cause there's only
seven hours of darkness.

35:37.844 --> 35:39.929
Then the sun starts hitting the surface
of the planet and it causes...

35:40.013 --> 35:41.681
-[Oren] These are your orders.
-[woman chuckles]

35:41.765 --> 35:44.768
Upon first entering
Earth's atmosphere,

35:45.060 --> 35:48.980
proceed immediately
up the exterior of the mother ship.

35:49.064 --> 35:51.024
When the sun hits the surface,

35:51.107 --> 35:53.817
there's gonna be explosive outgassings
that are very dangerous...

35:53.902 --> 35:55.987
-Gus, he's seven.
-Brittany.

35:56.446 --> 35:57.697
You boys were, what,

35:57.989 --> 36:00.033
four and six when I went to the moon?

36:00.533 --> 36:01.493
Yeah.

36:01.910 --> 36:04.245
Now, you saw me go into space
seven times, didn't ya?

36:04.788 --> 36:07.290
I came back every time, didn't I?

36:07.582 --> 36:08.708
Yeah.

36:09.417 --> 36:10.377
[Tanner chuckles]

36:10.460 --> 36:12.754
Your mother and I used to play a game
when she was still alive.

36:12.837 --> 36:14.464
Now, the game was,

36:14.547 --> 36:17.049
if there was a chance
I might not be coming back,

36:17.592 --> 36:19.551
she wouldn't say it,
and I wouldn't say it.

36:20.303 --> 36:21.429
Okay?

36:21.513 --> 36:22.806
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

36:22.889 --> 36:25.141
-[Mitch] Hey, Fish. How about a beer?
-[Tanner] Hey, Mitch.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.185
You remember my boys, don't you?

36:27.477 --> 36:29.604
-Steve and Dwight.
-Of course I do.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.272
Gentlemen, welcome to Houston.

36:31.940 --> 36:33.566
Let me steal your old man for a second.

36:34.817 --> 36:37.278
-[girl] Can I take your picture, please?
-Okay.

36:37.362 --> 36:38.404
[camera clicks]

36:38.529 --> 36:39.781
-Thank you.
-[chuckles]

36:41.866 --> 36:43.952
So, what do you think of the crew?

36:44.993 --> 36:46.121
Heroes all.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.915
That's the finest group
I ever had the privilege of working with.

36:48.998 --> 36:50.165
Yeah, yeah.

36:50.542 --> 36:51.835
Off the record, huh?

36:52.377 --> 36:54.962
Well, they've been trained
in ways I'll never understand.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.924
They're smarter and in better shape
than we ever were in the old days.

36:58.007 --> 36:59.843
They're sober, serious.

36:59.926 --> 37:02.261
I guess I'd be a little happier
about this whole thing

37:02.345 --> 37:04.848
if I thought that any of them
were as scared as I am.

37:06.266 --> 37:07.851
Well, they're not scared of dyin'.

37:08.308 --> 37:10.437
They're just scared
of looking bad on TV.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.774
Now, look, I wish I'd been to the moon.

37:14.857 --> 37:17.026
I got respect for everybody
who's gone to the moon.

37:17.109 --> 37:18.694
But this mission ain't going to the moon.

37:18.778 --> 37:19.654
That's right.

37:19.738 --> 37:22.323
Frank Gifford, he was a great
football player in his time,

37:22.406 --> 37:24.491
but if he played now,
he'd get his ass busted.

37:24.576 --> 37:25.618
[Mark] That's right.

37:26.368 --> 37:28.413
[country music playing]

37:29.163 --> 37:31.458
[people chattering]

37:33.793 --> 37:36.379
All I'm saying is, the moon did not have

37:36.462 --> 37:39.674
a rotational cycle of 14 hours.

37:39.758 --> 37:42.301
I mean, this is...
We only have seven hours of dark

37:42.384 --> 37:43.928
when the sun's not up
to land on this thing.

37:44.011 --> 37:46.139
It was light when he landed.
This is gonna be dark.

37:46.221 --> 37:47.390
We're not gonna be able to see.

37:47.473 --> 37:48.808
You can't see now, Gus.

37:48.892 --> 37:50.101
[Mikhail] Don't worry.

37:50.185 --> 37:51.352
[Mikhail speaking in Russian]

37:51.435 --> 37:53.188
-We what?
-We can do it.

37:53.270 --> 37:54.522
[speaking in Russian]

37:56.065 --> 37:57.442
No, no, no. Sit down.

37:59.359 --> 38:02.654
I woke up this morning, and I realized

38:03.239 --> 38:04.824
none of you want me here.

38:05.991 --> 38:08.036
You don't even really know
who I am, which is okay.

38:08.453 --> 38:09.871
I walked on the moon.

38:09.953 --> 38:11.955
But I didn't belong to you.
I belonged to your daddies.

38:12.332 --> 38:15.752
Now, if I ask you to ask your daddies
what I meant to them,

38:15.835 --> 38:17.337
to explain to you what I'm doing here,

38:17.796 --> 38:19.464
that's only gonna make things worse.

38:19.589 --> 38:20.464
So...

38:21.633 --> 38:22.634
What do we do?

38:30.892 --> 38:32.852
You haven't trained for this mission.

38:33.770 --> 38:34.813
We respect you.

38:35.438 --> 38:36.689
I appreciate that.

38:36.772 --> 38:38.149
But you're here...

38:38.732 --> 38:40.484
You're here because the powers that be

38:40.609 --> 38:42.904
think we need
a familiar face on this trip.

38:43.363 --> 38:44.989
You're here for public relations.

38:45.073 --> 38:47.325
No, no. I'm here

Good evening.

44:10.940 --> 44:12.607
Sometime in the next hour,

44:12.692 --> 44:15.486
the <i>Messiah</i> mission
will enter its most critical phase:

44:15.569 --> 44:17.488
the interception of Wolf-Biederman

44:17.571 --> 44:19.656
and the setting of the nuclear devices

44:19.740 --> 44:22.243
that will deflect it off
its collision course with Earth.

44:23.578 --> 44:25.872

[Tanner] <i>The Mississippi River</i>
<i>In Mark Twain's time,</i>

44:53.107 --> 44:56.194
there were riverboat pilots
who only knew a few miles of the river.

44:56.611 --> 45:00.239
I mean, conditions changed so much,
you couldn't know the whole trip.

45:00.656 --> 45:03.116
Floods, sandbars, fallen logs.

45:03.491 --> 45:05.118
It was all a riverboat pilot could do,

45:05.203 --> 45:08.455
was to know
his little piece of the puzzle.

45:09.248 --> 45:11.709
So for the next few hours,
this is my ship.

45:13.127 --> 45:14.712

What happens if they do not get off
the comet's surface in time?

50:15.261 --> 50:17.556
The sun striking the comet

Get your visor down!

54:14.667 --> 54:16.170
[Oren screaming]

54:16.670 --> 54:18.046
<i>My eyes!</i>

54:18.379 --> 54:20.007
[screaming]

54:21.759 --> 54:23.719
-[Mark] All right, we got him.
-[Oren] Oh, God!

54:24.178 --> 54:25.471
My eyes!

54:25.803 --> 54:27.973
[Oren groaning]

54:44.656 --> 54:48.786

55:06.678 --> 55:07.971
[Andrea] <i>Oh, God, we're losing one.</i>

55:08.180 --> 55:10.390
He's got escape velocity,
1,000 feet and climbing.

55:12.058 --> 55:14.353
[screaming]

55:14.435 --> 55:17.314
Mark, Mikhail, get the hell out of there!

55:38.125 --> 55:39.419
[Tanner] Firing primary thrusters.

55:39.502 --> 55:41.754
-Payload doors still open.
-Close 'em as we go.

55:50.221 --> 55:52.057
[static crackling]

56:01.732 --> 56:03.986
[Tanner on TV]
<i>Houston, all moles are at depth.</i>

56:04.486 --> 56:05.946
<i>Nukes hot and ready.</i>

56:07.281 --> 56:09.324
<i>We lost Partenza</i>
<i>to explosive outgassing.</i>

56:11.201 --> 56:12.870
<i>And Monash is injured.</i>

56:14.413 --> 56:16.330
[breathes heavily]

56:18.207 --> 56:19.542
We have to go get Gus.

56:19.625 --> 56:20.961
[Tanner] There's no time for that.

56:21.044 --> 56:22.796
Repressurize the cargo bay.

56:22.879 --> 56:24.298
He's going to die out there!

56:24.381 --> 56:25.966
We can still find him. He has a beacon.

56:26.049 --> 56:27.509
[Tanner] I don't have time
to argue with you.

56:27.593 --> 56:29.386
Just sit down, be quiet.

56:29.511 --> 56:30.721
Turn on the fuckin' locator!

56:30.846 --> 56:33.223
We've used most of our propellant
to get us out of the coma.

56:33.307 --> 56:34.850
We can't just leave him.
We have to go back.

56:34.933 --> 56:36.475
If we go back for Gus, we all die.

56:36.602 --> 56:38.395
We can't just leave him in space!

56:39.312 --> 56:41.356
[whispering]
Sit down, Mick. Sit down.

56:41.899 --> 56:43.066
It's okay.

56:54.786 --> 56:58.080
[Jenny] <i>The</i> Messiah<i> has safely</i>
<i>lifted off the comet.</i>

56:58.165 --> 57:01.627
<i>But sadly,</i>
<i>Gus Partenza has been lost.</i>

57:01.710 --> 57:05.212
Gus Partenza, a native
of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,

57:05.297 --> 57:07.966
and graduate
of Carnegie-Mellon University,

57:08.299 --> 57:10.259
joined the NASA space program

57:10.384 --> 57:14.306
shortly after completing his
medical training at Duke University.

57:15.307 --> 57:18.477
Dr. Partenza was selected
specifically for this mission,

57:18.560 --> 57:20.937
not only for his medical expertise,

57:21.312 --> 57:22.981
but also for his dedication

57:23.065 --> 57:25.859
to the advancement
of space technology.

57:28.694 --> 57:29.904
Yeah.

57:40.040 --> 57:43.752
With the loss of Dr. Gus Partenza
and with Oren Monash injured,

57:43.877 --> 57:47.464
<i>Captain Spurgeon Tanner</i>
<i>is now in charge of the mission.</i>

57:47.547 --> 57:49.466
<i>The </i>Messiah<i> has successfully docked</i>

57:49.549 --> 57:51.509
<i>with the Orion-powered boosters</i>

57:51.634 --> 57:55.430

58:03.730 --> 58:07.267
<i>Once again, let me remind you,</i>
<i>there is a 20-second delay,</i>

58:07.484 --> 58:09.736
<i>so when the picture comes back to us,</i>

58:10.028 --> 58:13.281
<i>the comet should already</i>
<i>have been knocked off its present course.</i>

58:22.915 --> 58:25.210
[Tanner] Prepare to remove

58:28.504 --> 58:30.048
[Mikhail] Safeties removed.

58:38.056 --> 58:39.307
Weapons armed.

58:48.734 --> 58:50.192
[beeping]

58:50.902 --> 58:52.654
Three, two, one...

58:52.988 --> 58:53.904
Now.

58:59.703 --> 59:02.788
[Jenny] <i>So now we're just waiting</i>
<i>for the picture to come back.</i>

59:14.926 --> 59:16.344
Decompression in area six.

59:17.053 --> 59:20.098
[alarm beeping]

59:27.397 --> 59:29.399
[Mark] Mick! I'll get the halon!

59:30.734 --> 59:31.817

59:32.444 --> 59:34.029

59:46.415 --> 59:48.460

59:51.797 --> 59:53.799
[man] Yes. I'm still here.

1:00:00.638 --> 1:00:01.515
[sighs]

1:00:18.990 --> 1:00:21.993
[softly] ...even larger.
We've lost contact with the <i>Messiah.</i>

1:00:32.587 --> 1:00:34.214
[man] We're live in ten seconds.

1:00:35.382 --> 1:00:36.549
Cue the President.

1:00:37.424 --> 1:00:40.971
Mr. President, five, four, three...

1:00:45.308 --> 1:00:46.810
Hello, America.

1:00:47.727 --> 1:00:49.980
<i>It is my unhappy duty to report to you</i>

1:00:50.062 --> 1:00:52.107
<i>that the </i>Messiah<i> has failed.</i>

1:00:52.190 --> 1:00:54.692
<i>This computer-enhanced radar</i>
<i>image from Houston</i>

1:00:54.776 --> 1:00:56.736
<i>shows how the detonation succeeded,</i>

1:00:57.279 --> 1:00:59.573
<i>however, did not destroy the comet.</i>

1:00:59.990 --> 1:01:01.408
<i>There are now two pieces.</i>

1:01:01.575 --> 1:01:03.033
<i>One six miles wide,</i>

1:01:03.326 --> 1:01:04.828
<i>the other, a mile and a half.</i>

1:01:05.537 --> 1:01:07.705
<i>Both are still on a path towards Earth.</i>

1:01:08.957 --> 1:01:11.625
<i>We've lost communication</i>
<i>with the </i>Messiah<i> spacecraft,</i>

1:01:11.710 --> 1:01:14.254
<i>although we continue</i>
<i>to track it visually.</i>

1:01:14.337 --> 1:01:15.212
[Caitlin humming]

1:01:15.379 --> 1:01:17.549
<i>We don't know how many are alive.</i>

1:01:17.631 --> 1:01:19.466
<i>We don't know their condition.</i>

1:01:21.011 --> 1:01:23.263
Now we have to make
some decisions together.

1:01:24.431 --> 1:01:25.682
What do we do?

1:01:26.473 --> 1:01:29.227
You have a choice. We have a choice.

1:01:29.685 --> 1:01:30.937
Right now.

1:01:32.272 --> 1:01:33.940
Ever since the comet was discovered,

1:01:34.024 --> 1:01:36.151
we've been hoping
and working for the best,

1:01:36.526 --> 1:01:39.111
but we've also been
planning for the worst.

1:01:39.696 --> 1:01:41.781
Our strategy has been twofold.

1:01:42.698 --> 1:01:45.243
First, our Strategic Missile Command

1:01:45.327 --> 1:01:47.037
<i>is preparing to coordinate</i>
<i>with the Russians</i>

1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:50.457
<i>a massive strike of Titan missiles</i>
<i>to intercept the comets.</i>

1:01:51.415 --> 1:01:53.835
<i>If we can deflect these comets enough,</i>

1:01:54.544 --> 1:01:57.464
<i>they will bounce harmlessly</i>
<i>off our atmosphere</i>

1:01:58.589 --> 1:02:00.716
<i>and head on out into space.</i>

1:02:01.384 --> 1:02:04.346
<i>Unfortunately, the Titans</i>
<i>cannot be launched</i>

1:02:04.428 --> 1:02:06.848
<i>until the comets</i>
<i>are only a few hours away.</i>

1:02:06.932 --> 1:02:09.935
<i>And while we are confident</i>
<i>the missile attack will succeed,</i>

1:02:10.810 --> 1:02:13.355
<i>it is only prudent</i>
<i>that we now take cautionary steps</i>

1:02:13.437 --> 1:02:16.274
<i>to ensure the continuation</i>
<i>of our way of life.</i>

1:02:16.357 --> 1:02:19.527
<i>To guarantee that</i>
<i>there will be enough of us left</i>

1:02:19.611 --> 1:02:21.488
to rebuild a new world

1:02:21.571 --> 1:02:24.950
in the unlikely event
that the comets do strike the Earth.

1:02:25.700 --> 1:02:29.495
So in the soft limestone of Missouri,

1:02:29.578 --> 1:02:32.290
we've been preparing
a network of immense caves,

1:02:32.374 --> 1:02:33.917
and they're almost finished.

1:02:34.584 --> 1:02:36.544
And we can put
a million people in them.

1:02:37.294 --> 1:02:40.173
And that million people
can survive there, underground,

1:02:40.256 --> 1:02:41.383
for two years,

1:02:41.674 --> 1:02:44.970
until the air clears
and the dust settles.

1:02:45.886 --> 1:02:48.098
Now, the cave is more than a dormitory.

1:02:48.431 --> 1:02:50.267
It's our new Noah's Ark.

1:02:50.475 --> 1:02:52.560
We're storing seeds and seedlings,

1:02:52.685 --> 1:02:55.647
plants, animals, enough to start over.

1:02:56.356 --> 1:03:01.319
<i>On August 10th, a computer</i>
<i>will randomly select 800,000 Americans</i>

1:03:01.653 --> 1:03:05.573
<i>to join the 200,000</i>
<i>scientists, doctors, engineers,</i>

1:03:05.656 --> 1:03:06.991
teachers, soldiers, and artists

1:03:07.075 --> 1:03:08.660
who have already been chosen.

1:03:08.952 --> 1:03:10.995
Other countries
are preparing similar caves

1:03:11.078 --> 1:03:14.665
along whatever lines they feel are best
to preserve their way of life.

1:03:15.500 --> 1:03:16.667
This is ours.

1:03:17.752 --> 1:03:20.879
<i>Beginning tonight</i>
<i>and continuing until the crisis passes,</i>

1:03:21.339 --> 1:03:23.674
<i>I am declaring a state of martial law.</i>

1:03:24.466 --> 1:03:26.303
<i>The armed forces and the national guard</i>

1:03:26.428 --> 1:03:28.513
<i>are working with local law enforcement.</i>

1:03:29.180 --> 1:03:31.558
<i>A national curfew begins</i>
<i>at midnight tonight.</i>

1:03:31.890 --> 1:03:34.810
<i>Now, wherever you are, go home.</i>

1:03:35.770 --> 1:03:37.814
<i>Stay off the roads after sunset.</i>

1:03:38.606 --> 1:03:40.399
<i>Crimes against persons or property</i>

1:03:40.524 --> 1:03:43.653
<i>will be dealt with swiftly and harshly.</i>

1:03:44.863 --> 1:03:47.531
<i>News stations around the nation</i>
<i>are being faxed copies</i>

1:03:47.615 --> 1:03:49.451
<i>of the lottery procedure as we speak,</i>

1:03:49.616 --> 1:03:52.495
<i>and they'll be broadcasting</i>
<i>the details to you in a few moments.</i>

1:03:55.790 --> 1:03:56.957
[sighs]

1:04:00.837 --> 1:04:02.047
I wish...

1:04:05.174 --> 1:04:06.176
No.

1:04:08.053 --> 1:04:09.428
Wishing is wrong.

1:04:10.430 --> 1:04:11.890
It's the wrong word right now.

1:04:11.973 --> 1:04:13.390
That's not what I mean.

1:04:15.727 --> 1:04:17.145
What I mean is...

1:04:19.272 --> 1:04:21.107
I believe in God.

1:04:22.232 --> 1:04:23.192
Relax.

1:04:24.069 --> 1:04:25.779
[President Beck]
<i>I know a lot of you don't,</i>

1:04:26.779 --> 1:04:28.865
<i>but I still want to offer a prayer,</i>

1:04:29.616 --> 1:04:30.950
<i>for our survival.</i>

1:04:32.952 --> 1:04:34.370
<i>Mine included.</i>

1:04:35.330 --> 1:04:37.957
<i>Because I believe that God,</i>

1:04:38.582 --> 1:04:40.542
<i>whomever you hold that to be,</i>

1:04:40.960 --> 1:04:42.629
hears all prayers,

1:04:43.797 --> 1:04:46.006
even if sometimes the answer is no.

1:04:47.966 --> 1:04:49.676
So may the Lord bless you.

1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:52.263
May the Lord keep you.

1:04:53.473 --> 1:04:56.600
May the Lord lift up
his divine countenance upon you,

1:04:58.352 --> 1:05:00.145
and give you peace.

1:05:05.276 --> 1:05:09.614
[woman] And in five, four, three, two...

1:05:18.540 --> 1:05:21.875

That's it.

That's all there is.

1:07:25.165 --> 1:07:27.835
[Tanner] The interior
camera circuitry is shot.

1:07:27.919 --> 1:07:29.796
So, Andy, can we get back
into the cargo bay

1:07:29.879 --> 1:07:31.297
to reroute the video functions?

1:07:31.589 --> 1:07:33.466
[Andrea] Starboard cargo porthole's blown.

1:07:33.883 --> 1:07:35.218
We could go in with the EVAs,

1:07:35.301 --> 1:07:37.261
but there's not much left
in the life-support packs.

1:07:37.345 --> 1:07:39.221
[Mark] We should be able
to raise Houston on the low band

1:07:39.806 --> 1:07:41.057
once we get closer.

1:07:42.058 --> 1:07:43.850
And the Orion is still functioning?

1:07:43.935 --> 1:07:45.060
System check was okay,

1:07:45.144 --> 1:07:47.312
but I don't know about
the radiation shielding.

1:07:47.605 --> 1:07:50.232
So if we fire it up,
we beat the comet back to Earth,

1:07:50.524 --> 1:07:53.444
but we may end up glowing in the dark.

1:07:53.569 --> 1:07:54.861
[laughing] Right?

1:07:57.115 --> 1:07:59.283
Okay, so, uh...

1:08:01.410 --> 1:08:02.453
Anybody?

1:08:11.712 --> 1:08:13.006
Let's go home.

1:08:19.470 --> 1:08:20.596
Okay.

1:08:30.773 --> 1:08:32.608
[Robin] I have to say it's liberating

1:08:32.692 --> 1:08:34.777
knowing that I'm not going to be called.

1:08:35.111 --> 1:08:37.071
I don't think I've ever been happier.

1:08:37.654 --> 1:08:39.323
I've even stopped smoking.

1:08:40.282 --> 1:08:43.077
What are you gonna do
with all that extra money you save?

1:08:46.456 --> 1:08:48.707
Do you know the National Gallery
is saving all of the art?

1:08:48.791 --> 1:08:50.751
They're shipping it to the caves.

1:08:51.336 --> 1:08:55.130
I've given them my beautiful
18th century desk from New England

1:08:55.255 --> 1:08:56.924
and all the Sheraton silver.

1:08:57.258 --> 1:08:59.885
I really feel like
I'd protected something

1:09:00.595 --> 1:09:02.138
when I gave them.

1:09:04.640 --> 1:09:06.517
[chuckles] You should see my apartment.

1:09:06.684 --> 1:09:07.934
There's nothing there.

1:09:08.394 --> 1:09:10.354
It's practically Japanese.

1:09:13.523 --> 1:09:15.818
Seems kind of unfair that I got picked.

1:09:15.902 --> 1:09:18.696
You know, I'm not a doctor or a scientist.

1:09:20.822 --> 1:09:22.575
People need continuity.

1:09:22.658 --> 1:09:24.160
Everyone knows you.

1:09:24.827 --> 1:09:26.412
And they trust you.

1:09:27.705 --> 1:09:30.375
But I can't help you.

1:09:31.250 --> 1:09:32.710
Don't worry about me.

1:09:33.711 --> 1:09:36.421
I'm gonna be happy
as long as I know you're going to live.

1:09:41.385 --> 1:09:44.346

1:09:56.901 --> 1:09:57.985
Mr. Hotchner?

1:09:58.277 --> 1:10:01.197
Who did I think I was going to be
when I bought that bike?

1:10:01.280 --> 1:10:03.991
Well, every kid on the block
wants one now.

1:10:04.075 --> 1:10:06.327
Every parent on the block
hates you for it.

1:10:06.411 --> 1:10:08.663
Thank you, Leo.
That's the best news I've had in years.

1:10:08.746 --> 1:10:09.871
Um, sir?

1:10:09.956 --> 1:10:11.666
Could you give me a hand
over here for a second?

1:10:11.749 --> 1:10:14.251
-Yes, sir.
-I just want to get these bars up.

1:10:14.335 --> 1:10:15.628
-Hello, Mrs. Hotchner.
-Hi, Leo.

[Chuck] Same old crap on the TV.

1:10:25.346 --> 1:10:27.098
I'm really sick of it, you know?

1:10:27.557 --> 1:10:29.058
-Mrs. Hotchner?
-Sarah's on the hill.

1:10:29.142 --> 1:10:30.393
Thank you.

1:10:30.476 --> 1:10:32.353
[helicopter whirring]

1:10:38.276 --> 1:10:39.652
Where were you today?

1:10:41.028 --> 1:10:42.739
I've been looking all over for you.

1:10:43.531 --> 1:10:44.866
Why weren't you at school?

1:10:45.199 --> 1:10:47.285
My dad said I didn't have to go.

1:10:47.367 --> 1:10:48.911
He said there's no point.

1:10:55.626 --> 1:10:56.711
I talked to civil defense.

1:10:56.794 --> 1:10:58.212
They said if you and I got married

1:10:58.295 --> 1:11:00.380
we'd be family, and I could get you in.

1:11:01.715 --> 1:11:04.594
Well, what about my parents?
They're not your family.

1:11:04.927 --> 1:11:07.096
-I don't want to go without my parents.
-You don't have to.

1:11:07.804 --> 1:11:09.514
I'm the famous Leo Biederman,

1:11:09.599 --> 1:11:11.726
and I haven't used my fame for anything.

1:11:11.809 --> 1:11:13.769
But I got them to let your family go too.

1:11:19.400 --> 1:11:22.695
You... This is your
only chance to survive.

I thought like a child,

from this day forward,

1:14:52.487 --> 1:14:53.822
I'll get it.

1:14:56.826 --> 1:14:59.036
Yeah. How you feeling?

1:15:01.330 --> 1:15:03.249
-Fine.
-I want to tell you something.

1:15:03.541 --> 1:15:05.459
You children didn't bring
any real books to read,

1:15:05.543 --> 1:15:06.751
did you know that?

1:15:07.253 --> 1:15:09.588
I brought <i>Moby Dick </i>and <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>

1:15:09.672 --> 1:15:12.090
and Baker and Simon had never read them.

1:15:12.800 --> 1:15:14.635
Now, I'm afraid to ask you,

1:15:14.760 --> 1:15:17.722
have you ever read Melville or Twain?

1:15:18.639 --> 1:15:19.807
Hmm?

1:15:20.182 --> 1:15:23.477
Hey, I'm a child of the movies, Fish.

1:15:24.061 --> 1:15:26.105
Okay, I see.

1:15:26.522 --> 1:15:27.606
So...

1:15:29.150 --> 1:15:31.360
You got a shitty deal, Oren,
you know that?

1:15:32.318 --> 1:15:33.404
You truly did.

1:15:33.529 --> 1:15:35.822
-Don't worry about me.
-Yeah.

1:15:36.699 --> 1:15:38.159
I mean that. Really.

1:15:39.242 --> 1:15:40.702
Don't worry about me.

1:15:42.746 --> 1:15:44.206
My whole life I...

1:15:47.626 --> 1:15:49.587
You know how it is for guys like us.

1:15:51.047 --> 1:15:53.715
You... you and I, we're the same.

1:15:54.340 --> 1:15:56.469
What do you mean by that? [chuckles]

1:15:56.552 --> 1:15:58.137
Gotta be the best.

1:15:58.219 --> 1:16:00.014
Oh, I see.

1:16:00.806 --> 1:16:03.099
Be the best.

1:16:04.809 --> 1:16:06.728
[sighs]

1:16:15.946 --> 1:16:19.366
Sometimes I see flashes of light.

1:16:19.950 --> 1:16:22.995
You know, like colors.

1:16:24.121 --> 1:16:25.039
Yeah.

1:16:25.748 --> 1:16:27.500
I fall asleep.

1:16:28.751 --> 1:16:30.001
And I dream.

1:16:31.128 --> 1:16:33.672
But there's a part of me
that's always awake.

1:16:34.380 --> 1:16:36.550
And I can see myself dreaming.

1:16:42.223 --> 1:16:44.934
I'm seeing things differently, Fish.

1:16:45.017 --> 1:16:47.019
That's good. That's good.

1:16:48.228 --> 1:16:49.230
Fish...

1:16:52.441 --> 1:16:54.527
Why the hell do they call you "Fish"?

1:16:54.610 --> 1:16:57.279

1:17:00.282 --> 1:17:03.327
I mean, it took about 15 minutes
of my first day at the naval academy.

1:17:03.410 --> 1:17:04.495
Yeah.

1:17:05.955 --> 1:17:07.331
Your kids go there?

1:17:08.624 --> 1:17:11.085
Yeah, they did. They did.

1:17:11.168 --> 1:17:12.962
And they're good men, both of them.

1:17:13.504 --> 1:17:15.880
I don't see as much of them as I used to

1:17:15.965 --> 1:17:17.258
when Mary was alive.

1:17:18.425 --> 1:17:20.135
You don't have to talk about it.
It's okay.

1:17:20.469 --> 1:17:22.721
No, it's okay. It's okay.

1:17:23.054 --> 1:17:24.557
You're a married man.
You know what it's like.

1:17:24.639 --> 1:17:27.809
I mean, every marriage
has its good years and its bad years.

1:17:28.519 --> 1:17:30.437
We ended on a great year.

1:17:34.441 --> 1:17:35.608
Yeah.

We have a marriage license.

Um, I have it right here.

1:18:45.929 --> 1:18:46.889
Okay.

All right. Let's go. Let's move it out!

Mom. Wait.
Sir, my parents are coming too.

No, no. It has to be there.

-[Don] Leo, give me your bag.
-[Ellen] They must be there.

-I'm sorry. Let's go! We have to go!

1:19:12.039 --> 1:19:13.958
-[Ellen] You don't understand.
-Can you check it one more time?

1:19:14.041 --> 1:19:17.126
I put you on the list.
They said your names were on the list.

1:19:17.503 --> 1:19:19.630

-No, no, no. We have to go.

[Sarah] Yes, I need to stay with you.

1:19:30.683 --> 1:19:33.059
Sarah! Sarah, you need to go.

1:19:33.143 --> 1:19:34.436
No. I have to stay with you, Dad.

This is she.

Uh, 61.

1:20:38.584 --> 1:20:40.878
I'll come down there then. Thank you.

1:20:42.338 --> 1:20:43.714
Thank you very much.

Jenny, do you want us to do something?

1:21:54.326 --> 1:21:57.830
You're too late.
I already took care of everything.

1:22:00.249 --> 1:22:03.710
Come, come. Inside the car.
You're getting sick. Please.

1:22:04.044 --> 1:22:05.504
I want to talk to you.

1:22:07.505 --> 1:22:08.882
Please, come.

1:22:11.260 --> 1:22:12.553
I don't give a shit.

1:22:12.928 --> 1:22:14.596
Go home and tell it to Chloe.

1:22:14.679 --> 1:22:16.389
I can't. She left me.

1:22:16.807 --> 1:22:19.434
She's with her mother.
They both got scared.

1:22:19.934 --> 1:22:21.769
Come. I want to talk to you.

1:22:21.853 --> 1:22:23.147
I need you.

1:22:24.648 --> 1:22:25.941
How does it feel?

1:22:30.320 --> 1:22:32.239
I feel like an orphan.

1:22:35.242 --> 1:22:37.494
Jenny! Jenny!

1:22:40.998 --> 1:22:42.166
Stop.

Welcome to the Ark.
I'm section leader for Orange 254.

1:24:00.202 --> 1:24:02.913
Remember that. That's where
you'll be calling home the next two years.

1:24:02.996 --> 1:24:05.749
So gather your things
and follow me to the orientation gallery.

1:24:34.152 --> 1:24:36.321
Leo, come with us right now.

1:24:36.405 --> 1:24:38.365
I have to go back for Sarah.

-[Ellen] Leo
-Mom, I'm going.

1:24:47.374 --> 1:24:48.584
[Ellen] Don, what are you doing?

1:24:48.666 --> 1:24:50.544
I'm giving him something to trade.
That's what I'm doing.

1:24:51.460 --> 1:24:53.797
-I want you to take this.
-Dad, that's enough.

1:24:59.428 --> 1:25:01.722
[crying] Goddamn it.

1:25:02.054 --> 1:25:03.599
You take care of yourself, okay?

1:25:07.477 --> 1:25:08.644
I'm gonna make it.

1:25:19.322 --> 1:25:20.616
What about Entrekin?

1:25:20.949 --> 1:25:23.535
I don't know. He hasn't returned
my call in over two weeks.

1:25:23.619 --> 1:25:25.245
-Excuse me, Jenny?
-Yeah?

1:25:25.329 --> 1:25:26.663
Your father's here.

1:25:32.335 --> 1:25:33.337
Hello.

1:25:34.087 --> 1:25:35.047
Hello.

1:25:35.380 --> 1:25:37.174
I can't stay long. I'm leaving the city,

1:25:37.299 --> 1:25:39.009
but I wanted to show you something.

1:25:40.135 --> 1:25:42.804
I wanted to show you
that you're not an orphan.

1:25:46.974 --> 1:25:49.728
I have proof that you're not an orphan.

1:25:49.853 --> 1:25:50.812
Here.

1:25:54.441 --> 1:25:55.442
Look.

1:26:05.326 --> 1:26:06.452
Where's Mom?

1:26:07.788 --> 1:26:09.206
Behind the camera.

1:26:10.916 --> 1:26:12.709
-She took this?
-Mmm-hmm.

1:26:13.210 --> 1:26:14.419
And this one too.

1:26:16.338 --> 1:26:18.590
She was such an artist,
don't you think so?

1:26:21.009 --> 1:26:22.844
You don't remember
when we take them, hmm?

1:26:22.928 --> 1:26:25.222
I'm five years old.
How would I remember that?

1:26:26.514 --> 1:26:30.686
Some people do remember
when they were five years old.

1:26:33.146 --> 1:26:34.898
It was such a beautiful day.

1:26:35.482 --> 1:26:37.567
All alone on the beach.

1:26:39.777 --> 1:26:42.239
And, of course,
she would have been in the picture,

1:26:42.697 --> 1:26:46.410
but there was no one else
to hold the camera,

1:26:46.992 --> 1:26:49.955
and she insisted.

1:26:50.706 --> 1:26:52.165
You know how she is.

1:26:53.458 --> 1:26:54.835
How she was.

1:26:56.920 --> 1:26:58.004
Jenny...

1:27:03.218 --> 1:27:06.929
It was such a good day for all of us.

1:27:07.889 --> 1:27:09.474
Don't you remember?

1:27:16.773 --> 1:27:17.816
Keep them.

1:27:21.445 --> 1:27:22.612
Goodbye.

1:27:39.337 --> 1:27:40.589
[sniffles]

1:27:56.271 --> 1:27:59.273
[man on radio] <i>We have now confirmed</i>
<i>the launch of all the Titan missiles</i>

1:27:59.357 --> 1:28:01.985
<i>from their positions</i>
<i>in North Dakota and Wyoming.</i>

1:28:02.693 --> 1:28:05.237
<i>The comets are now</i>
<i>approximately 14 hours</i>

1:28:05.322 --> 1:28:07.365
<i>outside of Earth's atmosphere,</i>

1:28:07.949 --> 1:28:09.951
<i>and we are told</i>
<i>it should take these missiles</i>

1:28:10.035 --> 1:28:12.704
<i>less than 20 minutes</i>
<i>to reach their target.</i>

1:28:13.705 --> 1:28:15.499
Okay, here's what we're looking at.

1:28:15.791 --> 1:28:18.126
All of the Titans have been launched.

1:28:18.210 --> 1:28:20.920
We still won't know
if they've made a difference.

1:28:21.630 --> 1:28:23.715
The comets have to travel for a while

1:28:23.799 --> 1:28:26.218
before the radar tracking stations can see

1:28:26.300 --> 1:28:28.178
if they've been pushed to a safe course

1:28:28.344 --> 1:28:30.054
that'll bypass the Earth.

1:28:30.263 --> 1:28:33.892
So one more time, we have to wait.

1:28:53.745 --> 1:28:54.704
Are we on?

1:28:55.080 --> 1:28:56.748
[man] We're on, Mr. President.

1:29:06.800 --> 1:29:08.718
Our missiles have failed.

1:29:10.469 --> 1:29:13.223
The comets are still headed for Earth

1:29:15.934 --> 1:29:17.768
and there's nothing
we can do to stop them.

1:29:21.606 --> 1:29:23.066
So this is it.

1:29:24.442 --> 1:29:26.152
If the world does go on,

1:29:27.195 --> 1:29:28.989
it will not go on for everyone.

1:29:30.949 --> 1:29:32.867
[President Beck on TV]
<i>We have now been able to calculate</i>

1:29:32.951 --> 1:29:34.952
<i>the comets' final trajectories,</i>

1:29:35.036 --> 1:29:37.539
<i>and we have determined</i>
<i>where they're going to strike.</i>

1:29:38.748 --> 1:29:42.001
The smaller of the two comets,
Biederman, will hit first,

1:29:42.251 --> 1:29:43.920
somewhere along
the Atlantic seaboard

1:29:44.004 --> 1:29:46.798
probably in the waters
off the coast of Cape Hatteras

1:29:47.132 --> 1:29:50.969
in just under 12 hours
at 4:35 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.

1:29:51.887 --> 1:29:54.389
The impact of the comet
is going to be...

1:29:55.432 --> 1:29:57.267
well, disastrous.

1:29:58.309 --> 1:30:00.519
<i>There will be a very large tidal wave</i>

1:30:00.644 --> 1:30:02.563
<i>moving quickly through the Atlantic Ocean.</i>

1:30:02.647 --> 1:30:04.648
<i>It will be 100 feet high,</i>

1:30:04.733 --> 1:30:06.860
<i>traveling at 1100 miles an hour.</i>

1:30:06.942 --> 1:30:09.029
<i>That's faster than the speed of sound.</i>

1:30:09.779 --> 1:30:12.365
<i>As the wave reaches shallow water</i>
<i>it's going to slow down,</i>

1:30:12.532 --> 1:30:13.742
<i>but the wave height,</i>

1:30:13.825 --> 1:30:16.494
<i>depending on the depth</i>
<i>of the shelf off the coast,</i>

1:30:16.827 --> 1:30:21.206
<i>will be anywhere from 1,000</i>
<i>to 3500 feet high.</i>

1:30:22.709 --> 1:30:24.085
<i>Where the land is flat,</i>

1:30:24.169 --> 1:30:28.255
<i>the wave will wash inland</i>
<i>600 to 700 miles.</i>

1:30:29.340 --> 1:30:33.594
<i>The wave will hit our nation's capital</i>
<i>40 minutes after impact.</i>

1:30:35.054 --> 1:30:39.893
<i>New York City, Boston,</i>
<i>Atlanta, Philadelphia...</i>

1:30:41.186 --> 1:30:42.812
<i>All will be destroyed.</i>

1:30:43.480 --> 1:30:47.067
<i>If you have any means of getting away</i>
<i>from the path of this wave,</i>

1:30:47.358 --> 1:30:48.567
<i>leave now.</i>

1:30:49.402 --> 1:30:51.696
The impact of the larger comet

1:30:51.987 --> 1:30:55.157
will be nothing less
than an extinction-level event.

1:30:55.742 --> 1:30:58.036
It will strike land in Western Canada

1:30:58.119 --> 1:30:59.996
three hours after Biederman.

1:31:01.246 --> 1:31:04.209
Within a week, the skies will be dark
with dust from the impact

1:31:04.334 --> 1:31:06.251
and they will stay dark for two years.

1:31:07.545 --> 1:31:09.965
All plant life will be dead within...

1:31:11.758 --> 1:31:13.134
four weeks.

1:31:14.385 --> 1:31:16.096
Animal life within...

1:31:17.973 --> 1:31:19.432
a few months.

1:31:23.061 --> 1:31:24.353
So that's it.

1:31:25.938 --> 1:31:27.398
Good luck to us all.

1:31:54.050 --> 1:31:56.344
[Tanner] Could I bother
everyone for a minute?

1:31:56.428 --> 1:31:58.221
Let's take a look at the big one.

1:31:58.679 --> 1:32:01.182
Now, the outgassing
has created a vent

1:32:01.266 --> 1:32:03.684
a half mile wide
and at least two miles deep.

1:32:04.018 --> 1:32:06.021
Comet gets closer to the sun,
sun melts the ice,

1:32:06.103 --> 1:32:09.441
ice turns to steam,
we get a big hole, okay?

1:32:10.108 --> 1:32:11.192
So...

1:32:12.527 --> 1:32:14.029
how many nukes we have left in the back?

1:32:14.112 --> 1:32:15.071
Four.

1:32:16.447 --> 1:32:20.994
Okay. If we can get
the remaining bombs in that vent,

1:32:22.077 --> 1:32:25.081
there shouldn't be anything left
of that comet bigger than a suitcase.

1:32:25.290 --> 1:32:26.916
Now, we can't do anything
about the little one,

1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:30.754
but, you know,
it just might give them a chance.

1:32:32.630 --> 1:32:33.757
Now, without the arming codes,

1:32:33.840 --> 1:32:35.717
we're gonna have to wait
to set the bomb timers

1:32:35.842 --> 1:32:38.053
until we get closer to Earth
to raise Houston.

1:32:38.135 --> 1:32:40.263
[Mikhail] We may not have
enough life support left

1:32:40.429 --> 1:32:43.058
to get back into the cargo bay
for the nukes,

1:32:43.391 --> 1:32:45.226
much less to go down to the comet.

1:32:45.309 --> 1:32:47.812
And we sure as hell don't have
enough propellant left in the <i>Messiah</i>

1:32:47.896 --> 1:32:49.688
to maneuver with.

1:32:51.066 --> 1:32:53.108
How are we supposed to get back
off the surface once we've...

1:32:54.193 --> 1:32:55.527
once we've gotten down there?

1:33:01.076 --> 1:33:02.201
We don't.

1:33:08.791 --> 1:33:10.919
[sighs]

1:33:11.251 --> 1:33:12.754
Well, look at the bright side.

1:33:14.589 --> 1:33:16.840
We'll all have high schools
named after us.

1:33:38.780 --> 1:33:40.490
[Tanner on radio]
<i>Houston, this is </i>Messiah.

1:33:41.907 --> 1:33:44.119
<i>Houston, this is </i>Messiah.

1:33:56.965 --> 1:33:58.842
[Mitch] Nice of you to call, <i>Messiah.</i>

1:33:59.259 --> 1:34:01.427
We were beginning to wonder
what the hell you were doing up there.

1:34:01.510 --> 1:34:02.762
[Tanner] <i>Admiring the view, Houston.</i>

1:34:02.846 --> 1:34:04.429
Fish, is that you?

1:34:04.806 --> 1:34:06.683
Yep. We don't have time to talk, Houston.

1:34:07.308 --> 1:34:09.018
There's nothing we can do
about the smaller one,

1:34:09.102 --> 1:34:10.478
but we do have a plan.

1:34:10.562 --> 1:34:13.022
<i>We need the arming codes</i>
<i>for the last four nukes.</i>

1:34:13.148 --> 1:34:14.691
Arming codes? What the hell for?

1:34:14.816 --> 1:34:17.442
Mitch, we can do or we can teach.
What's your pleasure?

1:34:18.152 --> 1:34:19.320
[sighs]

1:34:19.404 --> 1:34:21.697
Get the arming codes!
Get the goddamn codes!

1:34:22.240 --> 1:34:24.534
[Jeff] We have one helicopter.
Holds seven people.

1:34:24.617 --> 1:34:26.661
We can ferry six people
to high ground in West Virginia

1:34:26.744 --> 1:34:28.036
and take Jenny to the Ark.

1:34:28.454 --> 1:34:29.706
Short stick goes.

1:34:30.790 --> 1:34:32.666
I always thought
it was women and children first.

1:34:32.750 --> 1:34:34.919
If you get the short one,
you can give up your seat.

1:34:38.005 --> 1:34:39.174
[Tim] Thank God.

1:34:46.889 --> 1:34:48.516
Well, that makes sense.

1:34:51.311 --> 1:34:53.730
I got a stick. I got a stick.

1:35:02.197 --> 1:35:03.114
[Jeff] I'm sorry, Beth.

1:35:03.656 --> 1:35:05.366
[Beth] Okay, honey, here we go.

1:35:06.242 --> 1:35:07.619
Let's go now.

1:35:09.621 --> 1:35:12.498
-Beth...
-There's always the road. We'll be okay.

1:35:12.581 --> 1:35:15.250
Come on. Ah, that's my girl.

1:35:17.754 --> 1:35:19.380
Okay, that's it.

1:35:20.882 --> 1:35:22.425

1:35:36.105 --> 1:35:37.648
[barking]

1:35:48.534 --> 1:35:49.701
Where's that key?

1:35:50.702 --> 1:35:52.080
Where's the key?

1:36:15.311 --> 1:36:16.853
[engine starting]

1:36:26.239 --> 1:36:29.617
[cars honking]

1:36:54.892 --> 1:36:56.311
Come on! Hurry up! Come on!

1:36:57.269 --> 1:36:59.272
-No, wait.
-What are you doing?

1:37:00.023 --> 1:37:01.273
[people chattering]

1:37:01.398 --> 1:37:03.735
Come on, Jenny, we have to go now.
We have to go now.

1:37:03.817 --> 1:37:05.152
Come on. Come on!

1:37:10.867 --> 1:37:12.785
-Beth, what are you doing?
-[Eric] Jenny, we have to go!

1:37:12.869 --> 1:37:15.204
The road was so crowded,
it was obvious we weren't gonna make it.

1:37:15.288 --> 1:37:18.416
so I thought, well, if the wave does come,
that we should be here

1:37:18.499 --> 1:37:20.668
because she likes it here,
and... I mean...

1:37:20.751 --> 1:37:24.255
We're on the 15th floor,
so maybe we'll be okay.

1:37:24.339 --> 1:37:26.215
Say goodbye to Jenny--
What are you doing?

1:37:26.299 --> 1:37:28.550
-Move! Come on! Go!
-Jenny, what are you doing? Caitlin!

When you were a baby,

1:42:06.786 --> 1:42:09.581
I once dropped you on your head.

When you came to the studio
and you brought those pictures,

1:42:20.259 --> 1:42:22.385

I remember that we were right over there,

1:42:29.643 --> 1:42:32.355
and that's when Mom
got that picture of the house.

1:42:35.483 --> 1:42:38.443
It was a perfect, happy day.
