[chanting in Latin]
Ad lucem gloria mea.

01:57.909 --> 02:02.664
Ad lucem gloria mea.

02:03.331 --> 02:06.960
Ad lucem gloria mea.

02:07.418 --> 02:11.673
To find Merlin's tomb, the Trollhunter
must destroy the Amulet.

02:11.756 --> 02:13.007
-That's--
-You really think

02:13.091 --> 02:16.803
-it was Merlin making the Amulet?
-I wasn't finished. That's deranged!

02:16.886 --> 02:20.223
I saw vague memories in my head
left over from Morgana.

02:20.306 --> 02:22.559
You're saying Jim should
destroy his Amulet

02:22.642 --> 02:26.312
'cause you think you saw
some old man put a map inside of it?

02:26.396 --> 02:27.397
It was Merlin.

02:27.480 --> 02:32.110
The key to finding his tomb, to finding
his staff, is inside his Amulet.

02:32.193 --> 02:36.823
The girl-child may be on to something.
The Amulet and the staff are connected.

02:36.906 --> 02:38.992
Both fueled by the magic of Merlin.

02:39.075 --> 02:42.412
If Jim breaks open his Amulet,
he can't armor up! And if he can't,

02:42.495 --> 02:45.206
"Goodbye, Eclipse Blade!"
How's he supposed to kill Gunmar?

02:45.290 --> 02:48.459
If we don't get the staff first,
none of that will matter anyway.

02:49.043 --> 02:53.756
Maybe I don't have to destroy the Amulet.
You said Gunmar has Aaarrrgghh!!! captive?

02:54.048 --> 02:56.718
And Aaarrrgghh!!! could be used
as an emotional anchor.

02:56.801 --> 02:59.429
-We'd portal-jump right to him.
-The plan is set.

02:59.512 --> 03:02.849
We save Aaarrrgghh!!! and stop Gunmar
by any means necessary

03:02.932 --> 03:05.184
before he acquires the staff.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.770
I can't say we approve
of all your life choices,

03:07.854 --> 03:10.940
but if you're going to run off,
you're going prepared.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.610
It's got a poncho in there,
waterproof matches,

03:13.693 --> 03:15.737
a flashlight, chorizo--

03:15.820 --> 03:19.407
Dad, Jim's got a sword made of Daylight.
You give me chorizo?

03:20.825 --> 03:23.036
It'll be a little taste of home.

03:23.119 --> 03:27.290
I packed your favorite,
Diablo Maximus breakfast burrito.

03:27.373 --> 03:30.043
Along with an extra pair of undies.

03:30.126 --> 03:33.129
Uh... thank you, Nana.

03:33.212 --> 03:36.758
I will take these two things
that are completely unrelated.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.676
No underwear for me?

03:39.969 --> 03:42.805
Just call, okay?
Text every once in a while.

03:42.889 --> 03:46.935
-And take pictures to know you're safe.
-[chuckles]

03:47.769 --> 03:51.189
Stay here. You're my brother.
And I still don't trust you.

03:51.272 --> 03:52.190
[chuckles]

03:52.273 --> 03:54.317
[clinks]

03:54.400 --> 03:55.235
You guys ready?

03:55.318 --> 03:58.780
For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command.

04:04.452 --> 04:06.246
-Let's get our friend back.
-[crackles]

04:09.791 --> 04:13.211
-Stay alert. Gunmar could be anywhere.
-Where are we?

04:14.087 --> 04:15.421
-[rat squeaking]
-[gasps]

04:17.798 --> 04:19.132
[sizzles]

04:20.843 --> 04:21.928
[grunts]

04:22.011 --> 04:23.805
-Aaarrrgghh!!!
-[gasps] Wingman!

04:23.888 --> 04:25.974
No, stop! It's a trap!

04:26.057 --> 04:27.767
[gasping, grunting]

04:28.977 --> 04:32.897
-[Toby gasps] A stasis trap! That's...
-The work of Angor Rot.

04:32.981 --> 04:36.109
-And he's upgraded it!
-Um, those are Dwarkstones.

04:36.192 --> 04:39.153
If we deactivate the stasis,
this place is gonna blow.

04:39.237 --> 04:42.782
Aaarrrgghh!!!, my friend,
they've used you as bait to kill us.

04:42.865 --> 04:45.326
-[groans]
-We gotta get him out of there!

04:45.410 --> 04:49.372
[straining] No, Wingman. You leave.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.666
-No, we're not giving up.
-[gasps]

04:51.749 --> 04:53.084
[rats squeaking]

04:55.211 --> 04:57.422
Guys, I got an idea.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.927
[grunting]

05:03.011 --> 05:04.220
[metal jingling]

05:04.304 --> 05:07.098
We should be witnessing
the Trollhunter's death.

05:07.181 --> 05:13.021
Agreed, but our Eldritch Queen
demands the Staff of Avalon. Lead on.

05:17.358 --> 05:18.359
[splashing]

05:20.236 --> 05:21.237
[grunts]

05:23.323 --> 05:24.532
[panting]

05:25.908 --> 05:31.456
"In this place of my final rest,
no magics here may enter."

05:31.539 --> 05:33.541
[panting, grunting]

05:36.627 --> 05:37.712
[growls]

05:39.547 --> 05:40.965
[growls]

05:42.008 --> 05:42.842
[gasps]

05:44.052 --> 05:48.431
You took my mind! [yelling]

05:49.348 --> 05:50.183
[both grunting]

05:50.767 --> 05:54.228
I will not be enslaved again!

05:55.480 --> 05:57.190
[both grunting]

06:01.944 --> 06:05.531
You are a dog and this is your leash.

06:05.990 --> 06:09.410
You are a dog and this is your leash.

06:11.662 --> 06:12.705
-[grunts]
-Stop!

06:12.789 --> 06:16.667
He can be useful to us.
We do not know what lies up ahead.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.587
-[snarling] Chain him up!
-[rattles]

06:20.963 --> 06:27.011
You won't make it out of this cave alive.
[growls]

06:27.637 --> 06:28.679
[Aaarrrgghh!!! groans]

06:28.763 --> 06:31.891
Toby drops the hammer,
we drop into the room below.

06:31.974 --> 06:35.728
The hammer's power and weight
might be enough to override the trap.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.815
Or it'll fail, Toby will disintegrate
into nothingness,

06:38.898 --> 06:41.984
-and we'll die with the explosion.
-Cool beans.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.862
Even if it works,
what if we drop into something worse?

06:44.946 --> 06:48.074
Than this? I'll take my chances.
Tobes, are you ready?

06:48.157 --> 06:53.704
Ready to possibly kill us all and die
in failure? Yeah. For Aaarrrgghh!!!!

06:55.414 --> 06:56.249
[yells]

06:56.791 --> 06:57.708
[screams]

06:57.792 --> 06:58.918
[rumbling]

06:59.001 --> 07:01.003
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

07:02.338 --> 07:03.172
Agh!

07:06.217 --> 07:07.802
[screaming]

07:10.596 --> 07:12.432
-[Aaarrrgghh!!! grunts]
-[Toby shrieks]

07:12.515 --> 07:15.184
[stones rumbling]

07:15.268 --> 07:17.437
-Is everyone all right?
-[coughing]

07:17.520 --> 07:19.021
-Wingman!
-Wingman.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.690
[Claire chuckles]

07:20.773 --> 07:25.194
-What is this place?
-[sniffs] Smells old.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.112
[yelps]

07:26.821 --> 07:28.197
[Toby gasps]

07:28.281 --> 07:31.534
[Blinky] Remarkable. An ancient gyre.

07:33.619 --> 07:38.166
-[Jim] Why would there be a gyre here?
-[Blinky] It doesn't even have controls.

07:38.249 --> 07:41.461
[gasps] Master Jim, your Amulet!

07:43.921 --> 07:47.216
-It won't fit.
-No, but the blue stone inside will.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.886
Claire, it's what you saw
in your visions.

07:49.969 --> 07:53.556
If I break the Amulet,
it will lead us to Merlin's tomb.

07:55.641 --> 07:58.811
[Blinky] Master Jim,
are you sure you want to do this?

07:58.895 --> 08:02.607
-The Amulet is your sacred charge.
-I know.

08:02.690 --> 08:07.570
-If you destroy the Amulet, it is forever.
-Forever and ever. I get it!

08:07.653 --> 08:09.322
Just making certain.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.199
[sighs] Thank you.

08:11.282 --> 08:15.369
If we want to catch up with Gunmar
and Angor Rot, we have to find the tomb.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.246
And the staff.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.088
For the glory of Merlin. [grunts]

08:28.049 --> 08:28.925
[whirrs]

08:37.600 --> 08:39.184
No turning back now.

08:43.606 --> 08:47.485
Whoa! The map! Claire, you were right!

08:52.323 --> 08:53.407
[rattling]

08:56.953 --> 09:00.248
If this is fate,
I really hope we're not destined to die.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.583
Only one way to find out! [screams]

09:04.001 --> 09:05.336
[Mr. NuÃ±ez, Strickler laugh]

09:05.419 --> 09:08.673
So there Jim was, sword to my throat,

09:08.756 --> 09:13.511
then Barbara comes out of the kitchen
[gulps] with a pie!

09:13.594 --> 09:15.972
-[laughter]
-Oh! What kind of pie?

09:16.055 --> 09:20.643
Jim and I looked at each other,
and I say, "Where is that contact lens?"

09:22.103 --> 09:25.314
-How'd you let this one go, Barbara?
-He tried to kill my son.

09:25.690 --> 09:26.524
Oh.

09:26.607 --> 09:28.276
-Oh, that's unfortunate.
-Right.

09:28.359 --> 09:32.154
-[phone vibrates]
-I got a text. It's Jim! [chuckles]

09:32.238 --> 09:34.490
- Well, what does it say?
-"We're okay!"

09:34.574 --> 09:38.035
Ha! They're okay! They're okay!
Have they tried the chorizo?

09:38.119 --> 09:42.623
"On way to Merlin's tomb, we'll let you
know if we make it out alive."

09:42.707 --> 09:47.086
-Winking smiley face?
-[gasps, chuckles] That was a joke, right?

09:48.379 --> 09:51.132
-[Toby retches]
-[Aaarrrgghh!!!] Hate gyre.

09:51.215 --> 09:54.093
-[Jim] Whoa, a hidden entrance.
-Yeah, but to where?

09:54.176 --> 09:56.137
Gunmar must've come through here.

09:56.220 --> 09:59.181
[Toby grunts, yelps]

10:00.016 --> 10:03.311
-Why no war hammer magic?
-No magics here.

10:03.394 --> 10:06.897
It appears this hallowed tomb
is warded against sorcery.

10:07.648 --> 10:11.527
[grunting] My Shadow Staff
doesn't work either.

10:13.029 --> 10:19.160
-These claw marks look fresh.
-Hmm. Yes, yes. As if... a struggle.

10:19.493 --> 10:20.661
[grunts]

10:20.828 --> 10:23.247
-[gasps] Draal.
-Draal is free?

10:23.331 --> 10:26.917
If there's no magic here,
maybe Gunmar's hold on him wore off.

10:27.001 --> 10:27.877
-[gasps]
-[grunts]

10:27.960 --> 10:31.589
Then we're not just here for the staff.
We can save Draal.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.072
[Aaarrrgghh!!! groans]

10:56.155 --> 10:58.032
[Jim] No way we can climb that.

10:58.115 --> 11:01.952
There must be some apparatus we can use.
A ladder, perhaps.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.037
-[fly buzzing]
-Ah.

11:03.704 --> 11:10.294
[sniffs, coughs] Ugh! What is this?
A tomb for Merlin's extra junk?

11:10.378 --> 11:11.796
-[Toby grunts]
-[rattling]

11:12.963 --> 11:15.049
Wait! Wow! Wow!

11:15.508 --> 11:16.384
[Toby stammering]

11:16.467 --> 11:17.301
Ah!

11:20.721 --> 11:22.390
[stammers] What was that?

11:22.473 --> 11:26.102
[gasps] By Gorgus!
Tobias, press that stone again!

11:29.021 --> 11:29.897
[rattling]

11:30.398 --> 11:33.484
[Toby]
Awesome-sauce. This feels super weird.

11:33.567 --> 11:36.404
Wait. The switch makes everything new.

11:37.238 --> 11:42.076
Or it's somehow jumping to the past.
That's crazy, though. Right?

11:42.159 --> 11:46.080
You're onto something, Master Jim.
We do seem somehow flung into the past.

11:46.163 --> 11:48.290
Or, at least, the room has.

11:48.374 --> 11:52.002
By wear patterns on the rocks,
I'd say this is hundreds of years ago.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.714
Ooh! Olden times. Today!

11:55.798 --> 11:58.592
-Olden times. Today!
-[Blinky] Tobias...? Tobias!

11:58.676 --> 11:59.969
Oh, sorry.

12:03.264 --> 12:06.016
Seeds. I know how to get out!

12:09.979 --> 12:12.773
Okay. Toby, take the bag off the tile.

12:16.735 --> 12:18.362
-[Blinky chuckling]
-[Toby] Whoa!

12:19.488 --> 12:20.489
Let's climb.

12:21.157 --> 12:24.076
-[Jim] Claire, you're a genius!
-[Toby] Good work, Claire!

12:24.160 --> 12:27.538
"And hey, good job, Toby,
for finding that bag of seeds."

12:27.621 --> 12:30.749
[Claire chuckling]
Yeah. Good job, everyone.

12:33.294 --> 12:36.422
-[grunts] Wish we had a light.
-Oh, wait.

12:36.505 --> 12:39.133
Ugh. I hate it when my parents are right.

12:39.758 --> 12:40.593
[gasps]

12:40.968 --> 12:43.387
-[Toby] Whoa!
-[Blinky] Great Gorgus!

12:43.471 --> 12:47.224
This appears to be a depiction of history.
A timeline.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.309
[sighs]

12:49.477 --> 12:53.272
-[Jim] The Staff of Avalon.
-[Blinky] Merlin's most powerful relic.

12:53.355 --> 12:57.568
He built it to channel the arcane energies
of the universe itself.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.403
Wow!

13:04.700 --> 13:07.870
[Blinky]
Merlin's sacrifice to banish Morgana.

13:08.746 --> 13:12.750
His cause carried on
by the champions he left behind.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.376
The Trollhunters.

13:18.881 --> 13:23.135
Whoa! Check this out!
Freaky. This looks just like us.

13:23.427 --> 13:26.263
[Claire] Whoa! That's us. Here.

13:26.347 --> 13:30.059
Impossible! The timeline appears
to continue beyond the present.

13:30.142 --> 13:33.896
-No, no, it can't be.
-Whoa!

13:33.979 --> 13:35.814
Forgot how gross this guy is.

13:35.898 --> 13:39.902
-Can I smash him again?
-Guys, if this is a timeline...

13:39.985 --> 13:42.696
[snarling]

13:43.155 --> 13:46.784
We meet again, Trollhunter.

13:46.867 --> 13:49.286
-[all scream]
-[roars]

13:49.370 --> 13:51.247
[both grunting]

13:51.956 --> 13:52.873
[Claire] Run!

13:53.374 --> 13:54.667
[Blinky] Run for your life!

13:57.127 --> 13:58.671
[grunting]

14:00.339 --> 14:01.340
Over here!

14:01.423 --> 14:02.424
[Claire] There!

14:03.926 --> 14:04.760
Trollhunter!

14:04.843 --> 14:06.470
-[grunts]
-[rumbling]

-[gasps]

14:10.808 --> 14:11.767
[Toby laughs, yelps]

14:17.523 --> 14:18.524
Draal.

14:19.567 --> 14:20.943
Jim! Look out!

14:22.278 --> 14:23.445
[rattling]

14:25.072 --> 14:27.533
-It's a dead end.
-[Angor Rot yelling]

14:28.284 --> 14:30.828
Plan! Plan! Plan? Anyone? We need a plan!

14:30.911 --> 14:33.831
Draal's arm.
Gunmar must've used it to halt the blades.

14:33.914 --> 14:35.374
Here goes something!

14:36.333 --> 14:37.877
-[growls]
-Go, go, go!

14:37.960 --> 14:39.545
I'll kill you!

14:43.883 --> 14:45.134
Jim!

14:45.384 --> 14:46.844
-Wingman!
-[Claire] Toby!

14:46.927 --> 14:48.137
[Aaarrrgghh!!! yells]

14:51.473 --> 14:53.934
-Gotcha!
-[Toby screams]

14:54.810 --> 14:57.813
I never thought I'd enjoy a wedgie
so much!

14:59.231 --> 15:03.986
[panting] Oh, Nana was right.
Gonna need those extra undies.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.070
Toby! [chuckles]

15:05.154 --> 15:07.031
[Blinky] By Deya's Grace.

15:07.114 --> 15:09.992
It appears we're in the innermost sanctum.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.912
The heart of Merlin's tomb.

15:12.995 --> 15:16.415
If this is the heart,
I bet Merlin's staff is somewhere close.

15:16.498 --> 15:18.292
[Angor Rot screaming]

15:18.375 --> 15:21.629
Draal can't be far.
Look for the staff, I'll get him back.

15:21.712 --> 15:24.173
There's only one way to go. Down.

15:25.215 --> 15:27.051
[Angor Rot screaming]

15:34.099 --> 15:36.101
Almost there. Agh!

15:37.603 --> 15:38.437
[sighs]

15:39.104 --> 15:40.606
[grunts]

15:40.689 --> 15:41.982
Spot anything, Wingman?

15:42.066 --> 15:46.487
Crystals and more crystals.

15:49.156 --> 15:52.993
Nothing yet over here. This place feels
like it goes on forever. [echoing]

15:53.744 --> 15:54.578
[faint sighing]

15:57.957 --> 15:59.041
[gasps]

15:59.124 --> 16:00.209
[grunts]

16:00.292 --> 16:01.293
Draal?

16:02.795 --> 16:03.629
[panting]

16:05.965 --> 16:08.217
-[growls]
-[panting]

16:10.469 --> 16:12.388
Trollhunter.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.556
Guys, I found Draal! [echoing]

16:16.225 --> 16:19.770
-Awesome-sauce!
-Hurry! We should regroup.

16:19.853 --> 16:21.647
[Toby] We're on our way, Jimbo!

16:22.815 --> 16:23.816
[growls]

16:24.400 --> 16:29.738
I made an oath to protect you.
I have broken that oath.

16:29.822 --> 16:33.117
I remember attacking you.

16:33.200 --> 16:38.872
-I have lost my honor, failed you all!
-No. It's not your fault.

16:38.956 --> 16:42.209
Gunmar forced you to do things
you would never have done yourself.

16:42.292 --> 16:46.797
You were under his control.
You're not just my protector, Draal.

16:47.589 --> 16:48.632
You're my friend.

16:49.091 --> 16:49.925
[gasps]

16:52.845 --> 16:53.679
[sighs]

16:54.680 --> 16:56.140
[Gunmar] Where is it?

16:56.223 --> 16:59.309
Gunmar. We gotta beat him to the staff.
Come on, Draal!

16:59.393 --> 17:04.857
By my father's name,
he will taste vengeance!

17:04.940 --> 17:06.858
[both laugh]

17:08.234 --> 17:09.236
[grunts]

17:15.784 --> 17:16.868
[squeaks]

17:16.952 --> 17:17.953
I see it!

17:19.997 --> 17:22.750
-Gunmar's almost got the staff.
-You get to the staff!

17:22.833 --> 17:26.587
I'll take care of Gunmar.
Hang on, Trollhunter!

17:27.046 --> 17:28.005
[Jim grunts]

17:29.590 --> 17:31.133
[grunts]

17:34.511 --> 17:35.929
[grunting]

17:40.350 --> 17:42.061
[yells]

17:43.604 --> 17:46.023
-[Draal laughs]
-[Gunmar] No!

17:46.106 --> 17:47.691
[rumbling]

17:47.775 --> 17:49.359
Trollhunter!

17:53.405 --> 17:56.408
[grunting, panting]

17:57.409 --> 17:58.786
Not so fast!

18:01.413 --> 18:04.083
Give me the staff, Trollhunter!

18:06.543 --> 18:09.755
-Gotcha! [grunts]
-[Jim grunts, screams]

18:12.424 --> 18:13.342
[screams]

18:14.676 --> 18:16.261
[roaring]

18:18.055 --> 18:19.014
[grunts]

18:23.143 --> 18:24.103
[Angor Rot roaring]

18:24.186 --> 18:26.188
[both grunting]

18:32.820 --> 18:36.031
I was given a last chance.
I will not fail!

18:36.115 --> 18:38.575
[growling] You are nothing!

18:40.702 --> 18:43.330
I'm the sworn guardian
of the Trollhunter.

18:44.206 --> 18:46.875
And here I honor my oath!

18:50.879 --> 18:51.713
[Jim] Draal!

18:54.967 --> 18:56.135
Rule number three!

18:56.218 --> 18:57.719
[groans] Not again.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.055
-[grunts]
-[Draal roars]

19:04.977 --> 19:07.688
-[chuckles]
-Great to have you back, Draal.

19:07.771 --> 19:08.605
[thumps]

19:10.023 --> 19:13.610
-Race to the top?
-Challenge accepted, fleshbag.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.333
[howls]

19:28.417 --> 19:30.002
Sorry. Bit close.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.422
-Take it. Don't make it weird.
-[chuckles]

19:34.256 --> 19:35.507
[panting]

19:37.843 --> 19:39.178
Draal, look out!

19:40.220 --> 19:41.680
[Gunmar growling]

19:42.514 --> 19:43.682
-[grunts]
-[gasps]

19:43.765 --> 19:46.894
[screaming]

19:51.607 --> 19:52.816
[Draal groaning]

19:53.275 --> 19:55.194
[grunts, panting] Draal!

19:56.570 --> 19:58.572
[Gunmar] Some protector.

19:58.655 --> 20:03.493
This is all there is underneath
that metal shell of yours? [sniffs]

20:03.577 --> 20:06.079
[grunts] You're not even a meal.

20:06.246 --> 20:08.916
[Jim grunting]

20:08.999 --> 20:12.669
[gasps] We're too late.
Gunmar has the staff!

20:13.462 --> 20:14.296
[Jim grunts]

20:18.967 --> 20:20.510
[laughing]

20:24.264 --> 20:25.474
The staff!

20:29.728 --> 20:31.271
[growls]

20:33.148 --> 20:34.358
[groaning]

20:35.734 --> 20:36.944
-[growls]
-Draal!

20:37.152 --> 20:38.695
[Draal grunting]

20:40.030 --> 20:44.243
You would give your life for a human? Why?

20:44.326 --> 20:49.039
[grunting] Because he's my friend!

20:49.706 --> 20:50.540
Draal!

20:50.624 --> 20:52.626
[Draal grunting]

20:53.460 --> 20:58.090
It has been my honor, fleshbag. [grunts]

20:59.424 --> 21:00.509
Draal!

21:12.020 --> 21:13.021
[Jim] Draal!

21:15.148 --> 21:17.067
[rumbling]

21:19.403 --> 21:20.737
[growls]

21:22.239 --> 21:24.741
You've served your purpose.

21:25.617 --> 21:26.702
Gunmar!

21:27.744 --> 21:28.745
Gunmar!

21:30.330 --> 21:31.415
Draal!

21:31.498 --> 21:33.125
He's gone, Master Jim.

21:33.208 --> 21:36.211
And without the magic of the staff,
the cave is collapsing.

21:39.548 --> 21:40.632
Go!

21:41.300 --> 21:42.301
Come on! Come on!

21:50.309 --> 21:51.518
[grunts]

21:54.771 --> 21:55.772
[sighs]

21:55.856 --> 21:57.774
