WEBVTT

00:02.403 --> 00:06.171
It was this or a Porsche!

00:09.577 --> 00:11.610
(exclaiming)

00:16.083 --> 00:18.250
(school bell ringing)

00:20.521 --> 00:21.520
(Barney belches)

00:21.522 --> 00:23.655
(whistle blows)

00:23.657 --> 00:26.692
(yells)

00:29.463 --> 00:32.998
(playing the blues)

00:35.169 --> 00:36.702
(tires screech)

00:38.506 --> 00:40.506
D'oh!

00:40.508 --> 00:42.341
(grunts)

00:56.223 --> 00:58.357
I love your low prices,

00:58.359 --> 01:00.325
but why did these weddings
get canceled?

01:00.327 --> 01:02.828
Returned because of a
fight over the prenup.

01:02.830 --> 01:03.796
Aw...

01:03.798 --> 01:07.299
That one there-- bride's dad
made a racist toast.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.333
(clicking tongue)

01:08.335 --> 01:10.235
She wanted a cake
with blue rosettes,

01:10.237 --> 01:12.237
he slept with her sister.

01:12.239 --> 01:16.308
Cake, will you do me the honor
of making my stomach

01:16.310 --> 01:19.144
the happiest bag of acid
in the world?

01:19.146 --> 01:20.179
You will?!

01:20.181 --> 01:23.549
(horns honking)

01:23.551 --> 01:26.118
Time for a shortcut.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.719
(tires screeching)

01:27.721 --> 01:29.221
Woo-hoo!

01:34.428 --> 01:35.794
Dad, the cake!

01:41.535 --> 01:43.602
Dad, our lives!

01:43.604 --> 01:45.537
Fine.

01:48.509 --> 01:50.342
(bleating)

01:56.317 --> 01:59.084
Uh-oh, they've got
the right-of-way!

02:02.490 --> 02:04.790
Morning.
Guten Tag.

02:06.594 --> 02:09.161
(all sigh)

02:09.730 --> 02:11.296
(humming)

02:11.298 --> 02:13.565
(tapping)

02:14.468 --> 02:17.870
Who's alone in the vehicle?

02:19.473 --> 02:21.173
Maggie's locked in!

02:21.175 --> 02:22.174
With the keys!

02:22.176 --> 02:23.242
HOMER:
Oh!

02:23.244 --> 02:24.510
What's wrong?

02:24.512 --> 02:25.644
Uh, first the good news.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.881
Two of your kids are not
locked in the car.

02:28.883 --> 02:30.315
Maggie!

02:30.317 --> 02:32.618
(screams)

02:32.620 --> 02:34.219
(sighs)

02:34.221 --> 02:35.687
(yawns)

02:35.689 --> 02:37.222
We've got to get
her out of there!

02:37.224 --> 02:40.392
Babies aren't supposed to sleep
on their stomach on a cake.

02:40.394 --> 02:45.464
Okay, okay, the spare key
is somewhere in here.

02:46.433 --> 02:49.801
What's this key
with the plastic skull for?

02:49.803 --> 02:54.373
That's the key to my box
with the real skull.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.440
(both gasp)

02:55.442 --> 02:57.743
Maggie!

03:03.384 --> 03:05.284
So how come we have
all these other keys?

03:05.286 --> 03:09.354
Well, if you live long enough,
you start to accumulate things.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.223
This is from a gas
station men's room.

03:11.225 --> 03:14.927
They put the block of wood on it
so you don't walk away with it.

03:14.929 --> 03:17.563
These are from a
key party we went to

03:17.565 --> 03:19.831
before we realized
what a key party was.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.901
We got out of there
just in time.

03:22.903 --> 03:25.737
(disco music playing)

03:25.739 --> 03:26.772
Aw, come on.

03:26.774 --> 03:28.307
You'll miss all the sex.

03:28.309 --> 03:31.410
Uh, this key opens
your parrot cage.

03:31.412 --> 03:32.844
Rules are rules.

03:32.846 --> 03:33.545
(groans)

03:33.547 --> 03:36.548
And these keys
are from all my jobs.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.516
MARGE:
At some point,

03:37.518 --> 03:39.718
we should try
to return these keys

03:39.720 --> 03:41.220
to their
rightful owners.

03:41.222 --> 03:42.287
Are you nuts?

03:42.289 --> 03:43.488
Let's have some fun!

03:43.490 --> 03:44.456
Homer, stop him!

03:44.458 --> 03:47.392
Stop who, Marge?
Be specific.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.995
Time to get my mischief on.

03:49.997 --> 03:50.729
(chuckles)

03:50.731 --> 03:53.799
Let's start with
a little federal crime.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.867
(laughs)

03:55.869 --> 03:56.935
Oh, thank God!

03:56.937 --> 03:59.605
I can get back the angry letter
I wrote to my boss.

03:59.607 --> 04:03.675
I really didn't want that
subscription to<i> The Atlantic.</i>

04:04.278 --> 04:07.846
Yes, and this patent
application for a robot dog

04:07.848 --> 04:09.481
could use a bit
more tinkering.

04:09.483 --> 04:12.618
With the biting and the
chewing on my tuchus.

04:12.620 --> 04:13.852
Oh, the laser eyes!

04:13.854 --> 04:15.721
Why did I give
it to him?

04:15.723 --> 04:16.755
What the...?

04:16.757 --> 04:18.924
I tried to do bad
and I did good.

04:18.926 --> 04:19.958
Haw-haw.

04:19.960 --> 04:22.027
Keys to the
Duff Brewery?

04:22.029 --> 04:23.362
Where'd you
get those?

04:23.364 --> 04:26.832
Well, it might have been
the time when...

04:31.472 --> 04:35.007
Duffman doesn't need
Duff to have fun.

04:35.009 --> 04:36.842
Seriously, you
got any beer?
No.

04:36.844 --> 04:40.879
I heard drowning makes you
feel like you're drunk.

04:44.852 --> 04:47.619
Or maybe I just
found them on the ground.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.622
(whistle blows)

04:51.792 --> 04:56.395
Wow! The guys at the AA meeting
will never believe this.

04:56.397 --> 05:00.999
Oh, my God,
there's the fire brewer.

05:02.603 --> 05:05.737
The beech wood ager!

05:06.974 --> 05:08.940
The rat filter!

05:08.942 --> 05:10.842
(rats squeaking)

05:10.844 --> 05:13.045
The Duff blimp!

05:13.047 --> 05:16.481
Oh, how I'd love
to drive that thing!

05:17.318 --> 05:19.351
(gasps)

05:19.353 --> 05:20.552
Really, Duff blimp?

05:20.554 --> 05:22.354
You really want me to?

05:25.392 --> 05:26.558
Oh, what the hell.

05:26.560 --> 05:27.759
Life is made to be lived.

05:27.761 --> 05:30.362
I've been buttoned down
too long!

05:30.364 --> 05:31.029
(laughs)

05:31.031 --> 05:32.798
(laughs)
Hey, Homer,

05:32.800 --> 05:35.100
I really had you
going there, huh?

05:35.102 --> 05:35.934
Homer?

05:35.936 --> 05:38.070
When we see each
other again,

05:38.072 --> 05:40.739
you'll be an old man
and I'll be a baby!

05:40.741 --> 05:43.942
And these are from sardine
cans your father opened.

05:43.944 --> 05:47.045
He saved them
out of sentimental value.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.547
Oh.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.615
I'll return this to the school.

05:50.617 --> 05:53.418
Well, Maggie, one
key left for us.

05:53.420 --> 05:57.556
Hmm. This looks like
it's from a windup toy.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.660
(humming)

06:01.662 --> 06:06.932
Hmm, I hope I haven't stumbled
onto my anniversary present.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.842
(toy farting)

06:16.844 --> 06:18.844
(phone ringing)

06:18.846 --> 06:20.145
Homer? Oh.

06:20.147 --> 06:23.648
Could you please turn
down those blimp engines

06:23.650 --> 06:25.751
and tell me
where you are?!

06:25.753 --> 06:27.419
(farting)

06:27.421 --> 06:29.020
I'll call you back.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.489
Come back, Pooter Toot!

06:30.491 --> 06:33.992
People might be offended
by your mild tastelessness!

06:33.994 --> 06:34.926
(chuckles)

06:34.928 --> 06:37.596
Oh, isn't that a cute
little choo-choo...

06:37.598 --> 06:38.764
(screams)

06:38.766 --> 06:39.831
(sighs):
Oh.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.133
Daddy, did you make

06:41.135 --> 06:42.567
that devil's music?

06:42.569 --> 06:43.802
It wasn't me, boys.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.003
It was the train.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.505
What train, Daddy?

06:46.507 --> 06:47.672
It-It was
right there.

06:47.674 --> 06:50.175
With the... and the...
you know, the...

06:50.177 --> 06:53.678
Jesus cries blood
every time you lie.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.747
(groans):
Oh.

06:57.618 --> 06:58.817
Hey, Lisa.

06:58.819 --> 06:59.818
What you doing?

06:59.820 --> 07:01.887
Returning this lost key
to Principal Skinner.

07:01.889 --> 07:04.689
But that key could open
any door in the school.

07:04.691 --> 07:05.757
Aren't you curious?

07:05.759 --> 07:07.459
Well, maybe a little.

07:07.461 --> 07:08.994
But I'd never break the rules.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.862
Little Miss Play-It-Safe.

07:10.864 --> 07:11.797
Have a nice day.

07:11.799 --> 07:14.966
Just like yesterday
and the day before that

07:14.968 --> 07:19.171
and the day before that
and the day before that

07:19.173 --> 07:23.442
and the day before that and
the day before that...

07:23.444 --> 07:25.477
(over P.A.):
...and the day before that

07:25.479 --> 07:26.711
and the day before that...

07:26.713 --> 07:29.714
SKINNER:
Nelson, either tell them
what they're having for lunch

07:29.716 --> 07:30.982
or get off the P.A.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.050
NELSON:
Sloppy Joes!

07:32.052 --> 07:34.019
...and the day before that...

07:34.021 --> 07:35.053
Tater tots!

07:35.055 --> 07:37.055
...and the day before that...

07:38.525 --> 07:41.526
Ooh, banned books!

07:41.528 --> 07:42.194
(gasps)

07:42.196 --> 07:44.229
Band books!

07:44.231 --> 07:44.963
(gasps)

07:44.965 --> 07:48.066
Could this key open...?

07:48.068 --> 07:50.702
Get thee behind me Namuche!

07:50.704 --> 07:53.071
That's the
Buddhist Satan.

07:53.073 --> 07:55.207
Let's give it a shot.

07:59.179 --> 08:02.547
No problem; just some cobwebs.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.685
(screams)

08:11.992 --> 08:12.991
(gasps)

08:12.993 --> 08:15.160
I've discovered a mystery
wrapped in a riddle

08:15.162 --> 08:18.563
in the basement
of a lousy school!

08:20.868 --> 08:23.101
It's like five classrooms
in one.

08:23.103 --> 08:26.705
A science room, student lounge,
mathnasium.

08:26.707 --> 08:27.239
(gasps)

08:27.241 --> 08:29.307
An experimental theater
all set for

08:29.309 --> 08:32.577
a production of
Samuel Beckett's<i> Endgame.</i>

08:32.579 --> 08:33.578
(gasps)

08:33.580 --> 08:36.715
A pull-down map of...

08:36.717 --> 08:37.883
nothing?

08:37.885 --> 08:40.185
And this ruler is unmarked,

08:40.187 --> 08:43.655
and the tabs on this pop-up book
have no effect.

08:43.657 --> 08:47.058
And this tooth has no dentin!

08:47.060 --> 08:48.760
Everything is fake.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.829
What is going on?!

08:51.265 --> 08:55.100
Mother, it is<i> my</i> birthday,
not our anniversary.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.134
Principal Skinner,

08:56.136 --> 08:59.571
do you know anything about
a bizarre hidden classroom

08:59.573 --> 09:00.672
underneath the school?

09:00.674 --> 09:02.073
Mother, I have
work to do.

09:02.075 --> 09:05.010
Well, it's work
if they pay you.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.711
They say they're
going to.

09:06.713 --> 09:10.649
Lisa, I know every moldy inch
of this unaccredited school,

09:10.651 --> 09:14.219
but I have never seen
such a thing as you describe.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.320
It's real!

09:15.322 --> 09:16.221
I can show you.

09:16.223 --> 09:19.024
Well, I have a very busy
schedule, but...

09:19.026 --> 09:20.892
Myra, cancel all
my appointments.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.128
You're just pressing a Mento.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.897
Very true.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.999
Okay, let's go.

09:31.171 --> 09:35.273
Hmm. Is it drinking and driving
if you're flying a blimp?

09:35.275 --> 09:38.243
Maybe I can find the answer
by texting.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.344
Yo, Lenny,

09:39.346 --> 09:43.214
do you know anything about

09:43.216 --> 09:48.019
driving a blimp
while intoxica...

09:55.329 --> 09:56.995
What was that?

09:56.997 --> 09:59.297
(toy farting)

10:01.234 --> 10:02.233
Uh-oh.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.769
(farting continues)

10:04.771 --> 10:07.939
This train is mocking
our intestinal distress!

10:07.941 --> 10:09.941
I don't think I've ever felt
this irritable.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.344
Excuse me.
Has anyone seen my toy?

10:12.346 --> 10:15.213
You mean your
windup hate crime?

10:15.215 --> 10:16.348
Ooh!

10:16.350 --> 10:17.248
(panting)

10:17.250 --> 10:22.387
And now, without further
ado, I give you this.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.856
(camera clicks)

10:26.126 --> 10:27.759
(gasps):
What?!

10:27.761 --> 10:29.160
<i>"One Thousand and One</i>

10:29.162 --> 10:32.130
<i>Vulgar Marching Band</i>
<i>Formations."</i>

10:32.132 --> 10:33.098
(scoffs)

10:33.100 --> 10:36.401
Truly these band books
deserve to be banned.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.336
I swear, there
was a room here.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.905
Lisa, Lisa, go home, relax.

10:40.907 --> 10:42.307
Try to do some kid things.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.775
You know,
with a ball or something.

10:43.777 --> 10:47.012
Or decorate your sneakers
with a Magic-brand marker.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.847
(groans):
Oh.

10:48.849 --> 10:49.881
(camera clicks)

10:54.921 --> 10:55.887
(laughs)

10:55.889 --> 10:59.157
Maybe this key will be the key

10:59.159 --> 11:02.227
to putting the "key" in anarchy.

11:02.429 --> 11:06.164
Last place anybody would
expect to see a moon: the sky.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.132
(chuckles)

11:07.134 --> 11:09.968
(people gasping)

11:09.970 --> 11:11.269
Ow!

11:11.271 --> 11:12.037
(howling)

11:12.039 --> 11:14.139
MATRONS:
Why, we never!

11:14.141 --> 11:15.206
(sighs)

11:15.208 --> 11:17.475
Good-bye, cruel world!

11:17.477 --> 11:18.443
(grunts)

11:18.445 --> 11:20.145
I'm alive!

11:20.147 --> 11:22.280
And you're my naked
fairy-god-boy.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.949
Aw, geez, I hope no one
heard you say that.

11:24.951 --> 11:27.886
And so, to this naked
fairy-god-boy,

11:27.888 --> 11:29.688
I present the key to the city.

11:29.690 --> 11:34.192
Now do us a favor and lower
your pants for the picture.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.060
Oh!

11:35.062 --> 11:36.961
Lisa Simpson
may be onto us.

11:36.963 --> 11:38.763
I oversee 14 schools,
Seymour,

11:38.765 --> 11:41.700
and for some reason, I always
find myself talking to you

11:41.702 --> 11:42.967
about one of
the Simpsons kids!

11:42.969 --> 11:44.769
Now... Oh, my God,
there she is.

11:44.771 --> 11:46.838
Act natural.
Act natural!

11:46.840 --> 11:49.274
Oh. Oh, hello, student.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.342
Um, we were just
standing here

11:51.344 --> 11:53.912
discussing how we have
no, uh, secrets.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.280
And nothing to hide.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.816
I'll just take that
key back now.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.818
What? No!
Give me that!

11:59.820 --> 12:01.352
(both grunting)

12:01.354 --> 12:02.420
Ah!

12:02.422 --> 12:06.057
Backing away from
something, Lisa?

12:07.094 --> 12:10.028
(Homer screaming)

12:11.331 --> 12:13.331
I've got to get back in
that room,

12:13.333 --> 12:15.500
but Skinner took away
the only key.

12:15.502 --> 12:18.470
What would Nancy Drew do?

12:18.472 --> 12:19.471
Oh, don't you worry.

12:19.473 --> 12:22.474
I'll get my friends
The Hardy Boys to help.

12:22.476 --> 12:23.441
(gasps)

12:23.443 --> 12:26.010
Extra!
Read all about it!

12:26.012 --> 12:29.881
Lisa's a liar!
Pants on fire!

12:29.883 --> 12:31.816
(Lisa groans)

12:32.285 --> 12:34.953
(siren wailing)

12:34.955 --> 12:38.723
Pull over before
somebody gets hurt!

12:40.961 --> 12:43.828
HOMER:
So long, suckers!

12:43.830 --> 12:46.798
Oh! Oh, the Zoomanity!

12:49.002 --> 12:51.269
Aha!

12:52.773 --> 12:54.973
Hi, my name is Lisa Simpson.

12:54.975 --> 12:57.776
Ah, yes, the Simpsons:
a notch and a bump,

12:57.778 --> 12:59.177
two notches and a bump.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.044
That's us.

13:00.046 --> 13:03.114
Do you think you could reproduce
the key in this photo?

13:03.116 --> 13:05.884
Yeah, but it's gonna cost ya.

13:05.886 --> 13:06.518
How much?

13:06.520 --> 13:08.853
$1.85. If you want

13:08.855 --> 13:10.155
that little plastic ring
around it,

13:10.157 --> 13:13.057
now that's gonna cost you
another seven cents.

13:13.059 --> 13:15.226
Keep the change.

13:15.228 --> 13:16.795
Yes, ma'am!

13:16.797 --> 13:17.896
(school bell rings)

13:17.898 --> 13:20.098
(kids chattering excitedly)

13:26.173 --> 13:29.941
How did this bookshelf
get here so fast?

13:29.943 --> 13:32.010
I bet it's shoddy.

13:33.380 --> 13:37.148
What do you think
of that, Nancy Drew?

13:37.150 --> 13:40.485
Geez, they're dropping
like flies.

13:46.193 --> 13:50.628
"The children
are on bus 23."

13:50.630 --> 13:52.063
(screams)

13:53.266 --> 13:55.533
(gasps)

13:56.436 --> 13:57.569
(groans)
I'm so sick of keys.

13:57.571 --> 14:01.239
They've brought nothing
but good luck since I got them.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.807
(grunts)

14:03.343 --> 14:06.611
Brandine, I think we finally
gots us something

14:06.613 --> 14:09.113
to cut off that umbrilical cord.

14:09.115 --> 14:12.150
Well, then you got
one more mouth to feed.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.519
Y'all want some chocolate milk?

14:14.521 --> 14:16.087
Yes, Mama.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.922
You got it, Embry-Joe.

14:20.126 --> 14:22.093
Mmm!

14:24.197 --> 14:28.333
That wisenheimer windup toy
could be anywhere.

14:28.335 --> 14:29.467
(toy farting)

14:29.469 --> 14:31.202
Hmm?

14:31.204 --> 14:32.270
(gasps)

14:32.272 --> 14:36.474
Chief Wiggum,
stop that train!

14:36.476 --> 14:37.542
(grunting)

14:37.544 --> 14:42.013
Things on the ground
are out of my jurisdiction.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.281
Oh, not through my legs.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.450
Oh, that's really rubbin' it in.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.018
(laughs)

14:47.020 --> 14:50.622
Ah. Maybe if I use a pen.

14:50.624 --> 14:51.990
(grunts)

14:51.992 --> 14:56.094
Aw, geez, here comes that girl
I always liked in high school.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.662
Clancy, is that you?

14:57.664 --> 14:59.898
Oh, uh, hey, Maryann!

14:59.900 --> 15:03.434
Uh, how are you at getting
pants off the ground?

15:03.436 --> 15:06.271
Skinner's involved
in this, deep.

15:06.273 --> 15:09.474
Crazy classroom, bus
full of missing kids...

15:09.476 --> 15:11.109
I know who'd
have some answers.

15:11.111 --> 15:15.213
Someone who's been here
a long, long time.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.617
Yeah, I've been held back
more times than I can count.

15:19.619 --> 15:22.687
Which I guess is why
I keep getting held back.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.389
You know anything about

15:24.391 --> 15:26.324
Bus 23?

15:26.326 --> 15:27.492
Whoa, Goldilocks!

15:27.494 --> 15:30.695
You best be leaving
those bowls of porridge alone.

15:30.697 --> 15:33.398
There's only one bed
that's just right for me,

15:33.400 --> 15:34.966
the bed with
the truth in it.

15:34.968 --> 15:37.368
Which is probably
the third one.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.671
All right, I'll tell you.

15:39.673 --> 15:44.375
I'll tell you about Bus 23.

15:45.011 --> 15:48.513
<i>It was a cold winter--</i>
<i>two-vest cold.</i>

15:48.515 --> 15:51.349
<i>A bus was loaded with kids</i>
<i>for a field trip.</i>

15:51.351 --> 15:54.018
<i>I was gonna shake 'em down</i>
<i>for field trip money,</i>

15:54.020 --> 15:58.156
<i>but what I heard shook me worse</i>
<i>than my dad when I was a baby.</i>

15:58.158 --> 16:00.191
Sir, this bus
is too heavy

16:00.193 --> 16:01.259
to cross
the ice bridge.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.494
They'll have to take
a more circuitous route.

16:03.496 --> 16:04.696
There's no time
to be safe!

16:04.698 --> 16:06.731
Now bang the side
of that bus!

16:06.733 --> 16:08.533
Bang it twice!

16:09.669 --> 16:12.437
NELSON:
<i>That bus never came back.</i>

16:12.439 --> 16:14.605
So the answer
to our mystery lies on

16:14.607 --> 16:16.708
the other side of
that ice bridge.

16:16.710 --> 16:17.709
But it's summertime.

16:17.711 --> 16:20.244
The ice bridge will be
a water nothing.

16:20.246 --> 16:22.180
Hey, kids!
If I tossed you guys

16:22.182 --> 16:23.715
a bucket full
of something,

16:23.717 --> 16:27.618
could you pour it out and
toss the bucket back up?

16:27.620 --> 16:29.387
Don't drink it!

16:30.056 --> 16:32.223
That's where the ice bridge
would be.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.291
Go down!

16:33.293 --> 16:35.326
(nervous grunting)

16:35.328 --> 16:36.728
(Homer screams)

16:36.730 --> 16:37.762
Dad, stop!

16:37.764 --> 16:40.665
But, oh, there's
so many buttons!

16:44.270 --> 16:45.470
(grunts)

16:45.472 --> 16:47.705
(screaming)

16:47.707 --> 16:50.308
Ooh!

16:54.481 --> 16:56.214
(screaming)

17:01.121 --> 17:03.321
(screams)

17:04.224 --> 17:05.289
Bart, take the controls!

17:05.291 --> 17:06.791
What video game
is this like?

17:06.793 --> 17:08.426
Blimp Assassin 3.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.595
For Wii or Xbox?
Xbox.

17:10.597 --> 17:11.829
Original or 360?

17:11.831 --> 17:14.365
Fly the blimp,
you spoiled kid!

17:14.367 --> 17:16.234
(gasps)

17:17.103 --> 17:18.803
I'll save you, honey!

17:18.805 --> 17:20.471
Boy, stomp on my head!

17:20.473 --> 17:23.374
Yes! And I've got
gum on my shoe!

17:26.646 --> 17:30.114
You're a real jerk...!

17:36.689 --> 17:38.356
(panting)

17:39.492 --> 17:41.592
Why you undead little...!

17:41.594 --> 17:44.162
That's not a real arm,
it's plastic.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.764
That doesn't mean you're any
better than him, young lady.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.199
He could be a war hero.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.501
No, I mean they're mannequins.

17:57.277 --> 18:01.079
Oh, there's nothing I can do
to save my sister,

18:01.081 --> 18:03.748
the blimp or this airship.

18:08.688 --> 18:11.055
(farting)

18:19.232 --> 18:21.799
(both gasping)

18:23.169 --> 18:25.136
(toy farting)

18:25.138 --> 18:27.538
(laughing)

18:27.540 --> 18:30.374
(sobbing)

18:30.376 --> 18:32.710
It's all pooted out.

18:32.712 --> 18:35.446
Oh, I'm sorry, Homie.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.581
It's worse
than you think.

18:36.583 --> 18:40.685
I have to buy you
a new anniversary present!

18:40.687 --> 18:41.352
(groans)

18:41.354 --> 18:45.857
Skinner and Chalmers loaded
that bus with those kids.

18:45.859 --> 18:47.458
But why?

18:47.460 --> 18:49.193
I can tell you why.

18:49.195 --> 18:50.361
(gasps)
Otto?

18:50.363 --> 18:53.664
Are you the one who left
the message on the blackboard?

18:53.666 --> 18:54.465
Yeah, it was me.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.668
I was the bus driver
when those sweet young angels

18:57.670 --> 18:59.770
were swallowed up
by the river.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.272
(sobbing)

19:01.274 --> 19:02.640
Now I'm gonna join them!

19:02.642 --> 19:04.742
Otto, they're just mannequins!

19:04.744 --> 19:08.179
Then... I'm not responsible
for a horrible tragedy.

19:08.181 --> 19:10.281
And I didn't do anything wrong
by fleeing the scene

19:10.283 --> 19:14.652
and not reporting it and killing
that hobo with the big mouth.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.521
I might have imagined
that last part.

19:16.523 --> 19:19.790
Skinner! When I say
"Drive us to Bolivia,"

19:19.792 --> 19:22.927
that is your cue
to start the damn car!

19:22.929 --> 19:25.663
I can't find the key!

19:25.665 --> 19:27.532
Looking for something?

19:27.534 --> 19:28.699
Yes, my car key.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.601
Does it look like this?

19:30.603 --> 19:31.702
Yes, quite a bit.

19:31.704 --> 19:34.238
He's got your key,
Seymour.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.674
I suppose you'll want to know
why this all happened.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.777
Picture what I'm describing
in your minds.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.812
<i>Years ago, we received</i>
<i>a government grant</i>

19:41.814 --> 19:42.847
<i>to improve the school.</i>

19:42.849 --> 19:44.815
<i>Unfortunately, I cashed it,</i>

19:44.817 --> 19:49.353
<i>and the money was in my pants</i>
<i>when Mother did the laundry.</i>

19:51.658 --> 19:54.492
But these pants were
good for another day.

19:54.494 --> 19:55.860
That's not your decision.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.795
I'm the boss of
my own laundry.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.398
Well, you don't have to sleep
next to you!

20:00.400 --> 20:02.867
CHALMERS:
<i>To keep the feds</i>
<i>from coming after us,</i>

20:02.869 --> 20:05.937
<i>we built the phony schoolrooms</i>
<i>that you saw.</i>

20:06.606 --> 20:08.406
LISA:
<i>So all you had to do was fill</i>

20:08.408 --> 20:10.675
<i>the class with mannequins</i>
<i>and take a few pictures.</i>

20:10.677 --> 20:12.510
CHALMERS:
<i>Yes, except for</i>
<i>one small glitch:</i>

20:12.512 --> 20:15.613
<i>we could only afford</i>
<i>to rent the mannequins.</i>

20:15.615 --> 20:16.514
(Homer gasps)

20:16.516 --> 20:18.849
SKINNER:
<i>If we didn't get them back</i>
<i>by 5:00,</i>

20:18.851 --> 20:21.319
<i>we'd be charged</i>
<i>for the extra day.</i>

20:21.321 --> 20:23.788
CHALMERS:
<i>And they didn't prorate.</i>

20:23.790 --> 20:24.755
(Homer gasps)

20:24.757 --> 20:28.559
Otto, maybe it was wrong of us
to let you think

20:28.561 --> 20:31.729
you killed 24 children.
Who can say?

20:31.731 --> 20:33.998
Well, there's two things
you didn't count on:

20:34.000 --> 20:35.600
my dad getting
a giant wedding cake

20:35.602 --> 20:37.702
and my sister
locking herself in the car.

20:37.704 --> 20:39.003
We planned for
the wedding cake,

20:39.005 --> 20:40.838
we just didn't see
the baby thing coming.

20:40.840 --> 20:41.973
Well, you
should've.

20:41.975 --> 20:44.508
How could I?
She wasn't even born yet.

20:44.510 --> 20:46.677
People have
babies!

20:51.651 --> 20:53.284
(tires screeching)

20:53.286 --> 20:56.587
Not to worry.
They're just mannequins.

20:56.589 --> 20:57.588
No, we're not!

20:57.590 --> 21:02.426
OTTO:
<i>Maybe we'll fall real slow</i>
<i>like</i> Inception.

21:03.396 --> 21:05.763
<i>Oop, guess not.</i>

21:05.765 --> 21:09.000
(keys jingling)

21:51.444 --> 21:52.977
Shh!
