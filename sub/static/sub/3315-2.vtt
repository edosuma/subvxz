‐So you can get her to validate

12:49.515 --> 12:51.352
‐your insane ghost fantasies?
‐I didn't book
the session, Troy.

12:51.385 --> 12:53.122
‐You did.
‐Jesus Christ, Michael.

12:53.155 --> 12:54.926
She was here when I got home
from the hardware store.

12:54.959 --> 12:56.863
That's all the time we have
for today, but I'd like

12:56.896 --> 12:58.366
for all of us to meet again
next week.

12:58.399 --> 13:00.838
I'll see myself out.

13:00.871 --> 13:02.207
(Troy sighs)

13:07.417 --> 13:10.023
You know,
it's not perfect, but...

13:10.056 --> 13:11.960
I like it here.

13:11.993 --> 13:14.097
I like how it feels
to be in this house.

13:14.131 --> 13:18.239
Honey, you don't feel all the
pain that's been inflicted here?

13:18.272 --> 13:20.476
Of course I do.

13:21.513 --> 13:23.850
That's what I like about it.

13:35.306 --> 13:36.408
(Adam sighs)

13:36.442 --> 13:38.412
So, who's your contractor?

13:38.446 --> 13:40.116
‐Uh, YouTube.
‐Hmm.

13:40.149 --> 13:42.187
Yeah, we've‐we've been
sort of DIY'ing it.

13:42.220 --> 13:44.291
There are some
really informative videos online

13:44.324 --> 13:45.861
for all kinds of stuff.

13:45.894 --> 13:49.134
Wiring. Installing drywall.

13:49.167 --> 13:51.205
Want to go upstairs?

14:00.490 --> 14:02.327
Second bedroom.

14:02.360 --> 14:03.563
ADAM:
Ooh.

14:03.597 --> 14:06.468
Okay. Wow.

14:06.503 --> 14:09.274
Yeah. Our, uh, daughter
actually finished that off.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.546
Is she blind?
Or have some kind

14:11.579 --> 14:13.349
of learning disability
that makes her not be able

14:13.382 --> 14:15.019
to know if something's level?

14:15.053 --> 14:17.424
Uh, no, not as far as I know.

14:17.457 --> 14:20.029
You ever hear the saying, "A man
who defends himself in court

14:20.063 --> 14:22.467
‐has an idiot for a client"?
‐Sure.

14:22.501 --> 14:25.173
(sighs)
Do you know what a man who
hires himself as a contractor

14:25.206 --> 14:26.543
to fix his own house is?

14:27.477 --> 14:28.479
Broke.

14:28.513 --> 14:30.316
Usually divorced.

14:30.349 --> 14:32.320
You're not saving any money
if you have to end up

14:32.353 --> 14:34.224
doing all the work again
because you fucked it up

14:34.257 --> 14:36.228
‐the first time.
‐I know, I know.

14:36.261 --> 14:38.466
I just, I...
We bit off too much.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.203
And I haven't told
my husband this,

14:40.236 --> 14:41.940
but I have been dipping
into our daughter's college fund

14:41.973 --> 14:43.476
to keep things moving.
I know.

14:43.510 --> 14:45.046
I figure we'll get it all back,

14:45.079 --> 14:47.083
but only if we finish
the job quickly.

14:47.117 --> 14:49.054
Which is why I called you.

14:49.087 --> 14:52.060
We are overwhelmed. Please just
tell me you'll take this job on.

14:52.093 --> 14:55.968
I will drop to my knees
and I will beg, if I have to.

14:56.001 --> 14:58.072
How'd you find me?

14:58.105 --> 15:00.209
You were the only contractor
who had a shirtless photo

15:00.243 --> 15:02.180
of himself on Angie's List.

15:02.213 --> 15:04.986
‐It's hard to stand out
these days.
‐Ah. Well, mission accomplished.

15:05.019 --> 15:06.355
(Adam and Troy chuckle)

15:08.259 --> 15:09.962
(loud clattering)

15:09.996 --> 15:10.964
Oh. Michael.

15:10.998 --> 15:12.367
This is, uh, Adam.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.371
He is a contractor,
and his initial bid

15:14.404 --> 15:16.442
was much lower than the others.

15:17.545 --> 15:19.982
Unless it's free, we don't have
the money to pay him.

15:20.016 --> 15:21.986
We have almost no extra cash.

15:22.020 --> 15:23.990
And while you may be great
at sucking dick,

15:24.024 --> 15:25.961
with all the work
we have left to do,

15:25.994 --> 15:27.998
a couple BJs aren't
gonna make up the difference.

15:28.032 --> 15:31.138
Listen, this,
it's a high‐profile gig.

15:31.171 --> 15:33.142
"I remodeled the haunted house
and survived"

15:33.175 --> 15:35.146
is a pretty good selling point
for new clients.

15:35.179 --> 15:38.219
Why don't I come back,
I'll take a look around,

15:38.252 --> 15:40.223
and I'll give you
a rough estimate

15:40.256 --> 15:43.229
of how many BJs it would take
for me to do the job.

15:43.262 --> 15:45.133
I'm kidding.

15:45.166 --> 15:48.139
I know I can find a way
to make this work for all of us.

15:48.172 --> 15:51.679
‐Tomorrow a. m. cool?
‐Yes. That is wonderful.

15:51.713 --> 15:53.182
‐Thank you.
‐Sure.

15:53.215 --> 15:55.253
Thanks.

15:59.595 --> 16:01.298
You're cruel.

16:01.331 --> 16:02.968
What?

16:03.002 --> 16:06.175
You kind of get off
on hurting people.

16:06.208 --> 16:07.678
It's subtle,
like the joy you take

16:07.711 --> 16:09.549
in not returning a phone call,

16:09.582 --> 16:11.385
or being the first
to tell someone

16:11.418 --> 16:12.688
that their partner is cheating,

16:12.721 --> 16:14.659
or that you just came
from a party

16:14.692 --> 16:16.696
they weren't invited to‐‐
it's so subtle, Troy.

16:16.729 --> 16:19.000
It just looks like a little bit
of naughty fun.

16:19.034 --> 16:21.338
But I know
it's more than that to you.

16:21.371 --> 16:23.577
Wait, you're just now
realizing this about me?

16:23.610 --> 16:26.448
‐After 20 years?
‐No, I've always known.

16:26.481 --> 16:29.354
I guess I liked it.
Or I didn't care.

16:29.387 --> 16:33.128
But that was because you never
turned your cruelty toward me.

16:33.162 --> 16:35.601
Oh, he is a contractor, Michael;
he's not a weapon.

16:35.634 --> 16:38.138
And I don't even think he's gay.

16:38.172 --> 16:39.441
That's not the point.

16:39.474 --> 16:41.044
We don't have
an open relationship,

16:41.078 --> 16:43.182
and you flirting with him
like that, in our house,

16:43.215 --> 16:45.186
in front of me,
that was an act of violence

16:45.219 --> 16:46.421
‐towards our marriage.
‐Michael,

16:46.455 --> 16:47.725
you are losing your mind.

16:47.758 --> 16:50.296
Flirting is not fucking, okay?

16:50.329 --> 16:53.570
I'm‐I'm sorry if I needed
a little bit of life and fun,

16:53.603 --> 16:55.339

consorting with the dead.

16:55.373 --> 16:58.078
We're in trouble, Troy.

16:58.112 --> 17:00.216
We need to get out
of this fucking house.

17:00.249 --> 17:01.753
No. No. Michael,

about what we want to do next.

Our finances are not the issue;
