01:51.277 --> 01:53.245
<i>Joining me now to talk more about that,</i>

01:53.346 --> 01:57.146
<i>Lieutenant Solomon Goff from</i>
<i>the Esmeralda County Sheriff's Department.</i>

01:57.250 --> 02:00.777
<i>Lieutenant Goff, at this hour,</i>
<i>what is going on up at the fire line?</i>

02:00.887 --> 02:03.287
<i>Well, they're just doing</i>
<i>the best they can to put it out.</i>

02:03.389 --> 02:07.086
<i>There's about 450 fire personnel up there</i>

02:07.193 --> 02:10.856
<i>and the fire is going</i>
<i>in all different directions. We're...</i>

02:43.263 --> 02:45.527
- You alive in there?
- Almost.

02:45.632 --> 02:47.463
All right. Shake a leg.

02:48.501 --> 02:48.601
<i>Thank you, Spencer.</i>

02:48.601 --> 02:49.499
<i>Thank you, Spencer.</i>

02:49.602 --> 02:53.003
<i>Well, the beach cities today</i>
<i>are gonna be in the mid-90s.</i>

02:53.106 --> 02:54.971
<i>What a great day to hit the surf.</i>

02:55.074 --> 02:59.477
<i>And downtown Los Angeles,</i>
<i>I'm forecasting a cool 102 degrees.</i>

02:59.579 --> 03:04.983
<i>And hey, you folks out in the valleys,</i>
<i>get ready for a record-breaking May high...</i>

03:05.084 --> 03:06.415
Stand up.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.546
<i>What'd</i> I tell you about that jersey?

03:10.657 --> 03:11.988
<i>It's</i> clean.

03:13.226 --> 03:16.423
- We're not advertising that guy, okay?
- Why not?

03:16.529 --> 03:17.894
<i>'Cause he don't</i> approve of him.

03:17.997 --> 03:22.559
- He's, like, 47ยบ% from the floor.
- Marcus. Another shirt, please.

03:23.736 --> 03:26.364
Look, Son. We talked about this, right?

03:26.472 --> 03:29.032
We decided to make the jump to Shaq.

03:34.581 --> 03:36.105
<i>Doesn't</i> approve.

03:37.250 --> 03:38.308
What?

03:40.653 --> 03:42.211
<i>What's</i> the rule?

03:42.789 --> 03:43.949
I <i>don't</i> know, you got so many.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.389
Have. I have so many.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.958
And let me remind you, not at the table.

03:50.630 --> 03:52.325
<i>It's</i> disrespectful.

03:52.799 --> 03:56.496
One, two, three strikes. <i>It's</i> out.

03:56.603 --> 04:00.130
- But Aunt Dorrie gave me this.
- I'll give it back to her.

04:11.184 --> 04:14.312
- <i>I'm</i> changing my name.
- How come?

04:14.420 --> 04:16.684
<i>'Cause I don't</i> wanna be
from this family no more.

04:16.789 --> 04:18.346
Anymore.

04:18.458 --> 04:19.925
What about me?

04:20.726 --> 04:22.058
You're on your own.

04:22.161 --> 04:24.595
So you're not going to Aunt <i>Dorrie's</i>
this summer?

04:24.697 --> 04:25.891
<i>I'm</i> going.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.433
Am I coming back, is the question.

04:31.404 --> 04:32.803
<i>Who's</i> this?

04:47.520 --> 04:50.387
You think they'll let us swim in their pool?

04:57.664 --> 04:59.131
Never this hot in Oakland.

04:59.232 --> 05:00.927
Oh, stop complaining.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.501
- Come on. Hurry up.
- I'll start unloading.

05:02.602 --> 05:05.298
- Coming.
- Okay, yeah. <i>That's</i> great. We're here.

05:09.575 --> 05:12.043
Well, I really like this...

05:13.613 --> 05:14.773
All right.

05:15.715 --> 05:19.014
I <i>can't</i> believe how imprudent you are.

05:36.502 --> 05:38.163
Did an inspector take a look at that?

05:38.271 --> 05:40.865
Yes. <i>It's</i> totally stable.

05:40.973 --> 05:43.771
They're building townhouses
there next year.

05:46.512 --> 05:50.949
Can you not be such a grump?
Can you not be such a grump?

05:53.152 --> 05:55.177
You made this possible.

05:56.622 --> 05:58.783
You helped a lot.

05:58.891 --> 06:01.985
This is so great. I love you.

06:25.918 --> 06:28.853
Johnny, my man. How you doing?

06:28.955 --> 06:31.719
- New neighbors?
- Yeah, looks like it.

06:32.358 --> 06:33.757
Did you meet them yet?

06:33.860 --> 06:36.294
You wanna give people a chance
to settle in, you know?

06:36.396 --> 06:38.660
I'll wait till the movers leave.

06:39.665 --> 06:41.963
How much you think they paid?

06:42.969 --> 06:46.803
I <i>don't</i> know, man.
Hell of a lot more than I did 20 years ago.

06:47.607 --> 06:50.542
Still the best investment. Up, up, up.

06:50.643 --> 06:52.907
When you're right, you're right.

06:53.479 --> 06:55.037
Have a good one.

08:12.091 --> 08:13.649
You'll make it, you have plenty of time.

08:13.759 --> 08:15.693
Well, the <i>pilot's</i> already checked in.

08:15.795 --> 08:18.389
And I <i>don't</i> mind driving you to the airport.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.762
You might look good in a Prius.

08:20.867 --> 08:24.826
That man <i>won't</i> mind driving me either,
and <i>I'm</i> willing to tip him.

08:24.937 --> 08:26.768
- Okay.
- Bye.

08:28.140 --> 08:29.698
- Chris.
- Harold.

08:30.309 --> 08:32.470
- Always a pleasure.
- Yeah.

08:33.546 --> 08:34.740
- You check in.
- Okay.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.315
Let us know how things are going.

08:37.416 --> 08:39.611
You know how your mother gets.

08:42.621 --> 08:45.318
What a shame he lives 400 miles away.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.335
- It makes me sad.
- Yeah. Yeah.

08:56.435 --> 08:59.165
- You gonna cry?
- Can he move in?

09:00.206 --> 09:02.231
Come on. Come, come, come.

09:15.621 --> 09:17.020
What the...

09:18.558 --> 09:20.025
What is that?

09:21.327 --> 09:22.726
I <i>don't</i> know.

09:27.133 --> 09:30.500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
<i>That's</i> my only Prada.

09:31.637 --> 09:32.729
What?

09:39.445 --> 09:41.003
<i>That's</i> better.

09:41.113 --> 09:44.105
- <i>He's</i> got security lights.
- Who does?

09:44.216 --> 09:46.013
Whoever, next door.

09:48.020 --> 09:50.511
<i>He's</i> got one on a pole in the back.

09:50.623 --> 09:53.649
I told you we should've
put sheets on the windows.

09:53.759 --> 09:56.523
Sheets? We need bricks.

09:59.131 --> 10:01.292
- Hey, babe?
- Yeah?

10:03.402 --> 10:04.835
I look okay?

10:04.937 --> 10:06.802
<i>It's</i> gonna be a hundred
and something degrees.

10:06.906 --> 10:11.002
I know, but I <i>can't</i> do this in just a shirt.
They'll think <i>it's</i> rude.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.839
Oh, is that where you're gonna put the...

10:12.945 --> 10:17.712
Yes, it is, because I like this space
and <i>I'm</i> the one <i>that's</i> here all day long.

10:18.484 --> 10:20.145
- Okay?
- Perfect.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.948
So I'll call you, like, 2:00-ish.

10:24.056 --> 10:25.455
You're okay driving the truck back?

10:25.558 --> 10:27.389
Oh, gosh, I <i>don't</i> know.

10:27.493 --> 10:30.155
Maybe if you showed me
where the key goes in the little...

10:30.262 --> 10:32.958
I'll show you where the key in the...

10:37.303 --> 10:39.794
- I gotta go.
- Okay. Break legs.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.168
- Hey.
- Yeah.

10:42.274 --> 10:43.935
We're homeowners.

10:47.847 --> 10:49.542
Sweetie, your bag.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.541
Babe?

10:52.018 --> 10:53.451
What the...

10:54.620 --> 10:56.383
- Here you go.
- I got a ticket.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.684
Yeah, well, you are hanging out a little bit.

10:58.791 --> 11:01.658
Well... So what?
Are we living in Bel Air or something?

11:01.761 --> 11:04.195
Sweetheart, <i>it's</i> not filled out. Look.

11:04.296 --> 11:07.788
<i>"Welcome to Lakeview, neighbor.
Observe all parking <i>regulations."</i></i>

11:07.900 --> 11:08.992
<i>"A. T."</i>

11:19.311 --> 11:21.245
Look at you, making nice-nice.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.645
Oh, gosh. A little cop humor.

11:24.283 --> 11:26.649
<i>He's</i> here to protect and serve us.

11:28.154 --> 11:30.554
Maybe we can borrow his handcuffs.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.012
I like that.

11:32.124 --> 11:34.649
- Hey, we can go over tonight and say hello.
- Okay.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.955
- <i>Don't</i> work too hard.
- Never.

11:47.073 --> 11:49.166
Out of here. Yo, chief!

11:49.275 --> 11:51.402
<i>Let's</i> roll, man. Five-O. Come on!

11:51.510 --> 11:53.603
<i>Let's</i> get out of here, man.

12:01.487 --> 12:04.820
Clarence Darlington, hold! <i>Don't</i> run.
Hey, hey! <i>Don't</i> make us chase you.

12:04.924 --> 12:06.915
Nobody say nothing.

12:07.026 --> 12:08.015
Shit!

12:08.127 --> 12:11.290
Come here. Front and center, <i>let's</i> go.
Right here.

12:12.765 --> 12:14.528
Some <i>French Connection</i> bullshit.

12:14.633 --> 12:17.227
Watch your mouth. Come on, on the car.

12:18.671 --> 12:21.799
Pulling this shit on me?
In front of my people?

12:21.907 --> 12:24.842
- I would never do that to you, dawg.
- This is for your benefit, man.

12:24.944 --> 12:27.742
Now it looks like you fought
the law and the law won.

12:27.847 --> 12:29.041
You can go back and be the man,

12:29.148 --> 12:30.775
instead of the crack-dealing
little snitch that you are.

12:30.883 --> 12:34.046
Forget the circumstance.
<i>Shit's</i> disrespectful to a brother.

12:34.153 --> 12:35.984
Brother? Clarence, we <i>ain't</i> brothers.

12:36.088 --> 12:38.386
We <i>didn't</i> even crawl out of
the same evolutionary pool.

12:38.491 --> 12:41.153
What are you, anyway?
You know, I always wondered about that.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.751
You a Euro-Mexi-Japa-Chine-stani or what?

12:43.863 --> 12:45.922
You <i>don't</i> even know, do you?
<i>Ain't</i> got a clue.

12:46.031 --> 12:47.521
- Watch yourself.
- You're a weed, <i>that's</i> what you are.

12:47.633 --> 12:49.533
A junkyard weed.

12:49.635 --> 12:51.159
Spray your ass with some Roundup.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.897
<i>I'm</i> 1l7th Cherokee, bitch!

12:53.005 --> 12:56.634
Yeah, and the other 93ยบ% wigger.
Can you do the math on that, dumb ass?

12:56.742 --> 13:01.202
You got problems, man. Seriously.
This shit aside, you <i>don't</i> see straight.

13:02.381 --> 13:04.042
What you got for me, Clarence?

13:04.150 --> 13:08.211
Give me something other than
this fake-ass Vanilla Ice impression.

13:09.388 --> 13:12.482
I know who popped that kid on Palm Grove.
Leontro Wilson.

13:12.591 --> 13:14.491
<i>He's</i> running with a crew up
in the Baldwin Village.

13:14.593 --> 13:16.720
- You got an address?
- What?

13:16.829 --> 13:20.094
You're the sworn officer.
Go knock on some doors and shit.

13:20.199 --> 13:22.394
- Are we done? I got quotas, too.
- Hold, hold, hold, hold.

13:22.501 --> 13:23.661
One thing. One thing.

13:23.769 --> 13:27.535
You get to stay in business
as long as you're useful, okay?

13:28.007 --> 13:30.908
- All right, man, you told me.
- Oh, and one other thing.

13:31.010 --> 13:33.535
No more little girls.
I <i>don't</i> wanna see that shit.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.273
Baby <i>ain't</i> too little for me.

13:35.381 --> 13:40.011
Just 'cause they <i>don't</i> scream when you
use them <i>doesn't</i> mean they're not little.

13:40.119 --> 13:41.780
You understand me?

13:42.354 --> 13:43.821
Now bounce.

13:45.324 --> 13:46.484
Prick.

13:47.259 --> 13:49.227
Watch your ass, big guy.

14:54.927 --> 14:57.418
Give me your wallet.
Give up the wallet, man. Give it up!

14:57.529 --> 14:59.360
- Oh, shit.
- Come on, hurry up! Give it up!

14:59.465 --> 15:01.433
And turn that shit down!

15:02.935 --> 15:04.493
God damn it.

15:04.603 --> 15:06.867
Boy, you got a lot to learn.

15:06.972 --> 15:08.030
What?

15:10.175 --> 15:13.144
Never roll your window down
when somebody does that.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.907
No matter where you are, Chris.

15:17.650 --> 15:21.586
- You scared the hell out of me.
- Well, how else you gonna learn?

15:21.720 --> 15:24.553
- Abel Turner.
- Hey. Yeah, Chris...

15:24.657 --> 15:25.646
Mattson.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.988
Yeah. I was meaning to come over.

15:28.093 --> 15:31.494
- You got a lot on your hands.
- Yeah, well, you know, moving and...

15:31.597 --> 15:33.497
- <i>It's</i> very stressful, you know?
- Yeah.

15:33.599 --> 15:37.797
But you got your mad beats
and your blunt here to help you chill out.

15:38.437 --> 15:41.702
Oh, <i>it's</i> just a cigarette. Organic.

15:41.807 --> 15:44.435
Okay. Not against the law yet.

15:44.543 --> 15:47.569
Well, it is in my house.

15:48.380 --> 15:49.711
I hear you.

15:50.382 --> 15:52.748
So are you a SoCal boy, Chris?

15:52.851 --> 15:54.045
Chicago.

15:54.153 --> 15:58.886
Went to Berkeley on a lacrosse scholarship.
Stayed there after college.

15:58.991 --> 16:01.619
- Doing what?
- I work for Good.

16:01.727 --> 16:05.686
Oh, the enemy of evil.
You a superhero there, Chris?

16:06.398 --> 16:09.390
No, the supermarket chain. Yeah.

16:09.501 --> 16:12.197
They're expanding down here,
so we talked it over...

16:12.304 --> 16:13.862
- You and your wife?
- Yeah, Lisa.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.567
- Is she from Chicago, too?
- No, <i>she's</i> from up there.

16:16.675 --> 16:18.233
- Berkeley.
- Oakland.

16:18.344 --> 16:20.608
Oak-town girl, all right!

16:20.713 --> 16:22.340
Kind of, like, opposites attract.

16:22.448 --> 16:25.611
Well, no, not exactly.
We actually have a lot in common.

16:25.718 --> 16:27.345
Yeah? Like what?

16:28.821 --> 16:29.845
Well...

16:29.955 --> 16:31.286
Rap music.

16:31.390 --> 16:33.358
Well, I like it, she doesn't.

16:33.459 --> 16:34.892
Imagine that.

16:35.794 --> 16:36.852
Yeah.

16:36.962 --> 16:38.691
Yeah, well, <i>I'm</i> going to finish my rounds.

16:38.797 --> 16:41.357
You know, I do a little neighborhood patrol
every night, you know?

16:41.467 --> 16:42.456
Oh. Cool.

16:42.568 --> 16:45.560
- Welcome. Good to have you.
- Thanks, yeah. Nice to meet you.

16:45.671 --> 16:46.899
All right.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.974
Say, you know,

16:49.942 --> 16:52.604
you can listen to that noise all night long,

16:52.711 --> 16:56.477
but when you wake up in the morning,
you'll still be white.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.705
- There you are.
- Hi.

17:55.707 --> 17:57.038
<i>How's</i> the water?

17:57.576 --> 17:59.100
Amazing.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.638
- How was your day?
- Awesome.

18:03.148 --> 18:05.139
So I met our new neighbor.

18:05.250 --> 18:08.219
A.T. Abel Turner.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.514
And?

18:10.756 --> 18:13.884
He has a very special brand of humor.

18:13.992 --> 18:15.823
So he was joking.

18:17.262 --> 18:20.095
- Yeah.
- Did you ask him about the lights?

18:20.899 --> 18:22.628
<i>Wasn't</i> the best time.

18:25.370 --> 18:26.962
- I always wanted to say this.
- What?

18:27.072 --> 18:29.267
<i>"Honey, I'm homeowner."</i>

18:29.374 --> 18:31.865
- No, <i>that's</i> really bad.
- No, <i>it's</i> good.

18:31.977 --> 18:33.239
No, <i>it's</i> bad.

18:33.345 --> 18:36.314
But <i>I'm</i> gonna kiss you and make it better.

18:43.989 --> 18:46.287
- What are you doing?
- Move over.

18:47.493 --> 18:49.484
Time to christen the pool.

18:49.728 --> 18:52.094
- We can't.
- Come on.

18:53.398 --> 18:54.922
<i>It's</i> our house.

18:57.536 --> 18:59.766
Hurry up and get in the pool.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.737
You're gonna go to hell.

19:07.846 --> 19:09.814
- I am not.
- Yes, you are.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.751
<i>God's</i> gonna send you down there
with a stiffy and <i>everyone's</i> gonna laugh.

19:20.859 --> 19:22.349
Man, you told me to look.

19:22.461 --> 19:24.656
You were dumb enough to do it.

19:26.398 --> 19:28.059
Get off me!

19:28.167 --> 19:29.794
Marcus? Celia?

19:33.105 --> 19:34.766
<i>Don't</i> say anything.

19:34.873 --> 19:37.967
What the hell is going on up here?
You're supposed to be looking out for him.

19:38.076 --> 19:39.907
I <i>wasn't</i> doing nothing.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.809
Marcus, hey, hey, hey.

19:42.247 --> 19:43.976
I <i>wasn't</i> doing what?

19:44.082 --> 19:46.607
Anything. I <i>wasn't</i> doing anything.

19:47.252 --> 19:49.777
What the hell are you fighting...

20:18.050 --> 20:20.484
Look, why <i>don't</i> you guys wash up?

20:21.253 --> 20:25.212
<i>Let's</i> go downstairs and have some
big bowls of ice cream. Okay?

20:42.608 --> 20:43.905
Babe?

20:44.943 --> 20:47.070
Can I ask you a question?

20:49.748 --> 20:52.615
This house has three bedrooms, right?

20:54.953 --> 20:57.478
And <i>there's</i> two of us.

20:57.589 --> 21:00.285
So, you know, like,

21:00.392 --> 21:04.021
how many offices or dens,

21:04.162 --> 21:08.462
whatever-type rooms,
does one need, really?

21:08.567 --> 21:10.228
Well, we could...

21:11.670 --> 21:16.232
I always wanted a sewing room for me.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.171
Sewing.

21:20.178 --> 21:23.045
Come on, we'll, you know...

21:23.148 --> 21:24.342
No.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.611
No, I <i>don't</i> know.

21:28.353 --> 21:32.221
I mean, I know that we could turn one
of those rooms into a nursery...

21:32.324 --> 21:34.349
- No.
...if we wanted to.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.326
Or not.

21:37.429 --> 21:42.162
Lis, come on, we've talked about this.
We'll get around to it. <i>It's</i> just...

21:42.934 --> 21:48.236
Right now, we <i>don't</i> know
how any of this is gonna play out.

21:49.741 --> 21:54.144
Okay. I just think that there are
really good reasons to not wait.

21:54.246 --> 21:56.680
- No, you're right.
- In fact, to do this right now.

21:56.782 --> 21:58.682
- No, I...
- You know?

21:58.784 --> 22:03.153
Like, <i>I'm</i> not only thinking about us.
<i>I'm</i> thinking about our families.

22:03.255 --> 22:07.021
I think that our families
would really benefit from...

22:07.125 --> 22:09.525
I know, I know, I know, I know.

22:13.765 --> 22:15.323
Are you hot?

22:16.201 --> 22:18.169
No. Are you kidding?

22:20.238 --> 22:21.398
No.

22:25.410 --> 22:26.638
No.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.680
It <i>isn't</i> working.

22:39.491 --> 22:41.015
Here you go.

22:41.126 --> 22:42.855
Why is it so loose?

22:43.995 --> 22:46.520
Probably forgot to screw it back in.

22:54.840 --> 22:57.070
The joys of home ownership.

22:58.744 --> 23:00.143
<i>What's</i> that?

23:09.688 --> 23:13.488
<i>It's</i> a good image for
an antismoking campaign.

23:19.498 --> 23:21.557
You've gotta be kidding me.

23:24.870 --> 23:26.861
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

24:09.481 --> 24:10.948
Mr. Turner.

24:12.017 --> 24:13.814
You can call me Abel.

24:14.686 --> 24:15.812
Morning.

24:16.655 --> 24:18.384
Getting your miles in?

24:18.490 --> 24:19.752
Before it gets too hot.

24:19.858 --> 24:22.292
Or before I talk myself out of it.

24:22.694 --> 24:24.685
Yeah, I hear you on that.

24:26.998 --> 24:28.431
Need a hand?

24:29.568 --> 24:31.331
Matter of fact, I do.

24:34.706 --> 24:36.697
Trying to reach this bolt down
here behind the battery.

24:36.808 --> 24:39.709
I need you to hold it this way, just pull it.

24:39.811 --> 24:40.800
There you go.

24:40.912 --> 24:42.345
- Come on.
- I got it.

24:43.648 --> 24:45.081
You all right?

24:46.518 --> 24:48.509
- Yeah, just...
- <i>Let's</i> see.

24:49.120 --> 24:51.111
Oh, yeah, you're not bleeding too bad.

24:51.223 --> 24:53.191
- <i>It's</i> all right.
- You're a tough guy.

24:53.291 --> 24:55.452
Must have some Irish in you.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.357
Black Irish, probably.

25:01.733 --> 25:06.295
Hey, you <i>didn't</i> see anyone around
the side of our house last night, did you?

25:07.272 --> 25:08.933
Something happen?

25:10.842 --> 25:12.776
<i>Lisa's</i> a little paranoid.

25:13.044 --> 25:15.035
Got an alarm system, right?

25:15.146 --> 25:18.343
Yeah, <i>it's</i> kind of wonky.

25:18.450 --> 25:19.576
You might want to get that fixed.

25:19.684 --> 25:22.983
You know, you got a woman
you wanna try and protect.

25:23.555 --> 25:26.786
Well, you know, this is stupid,

25:28.360 --> 25:30.828
but your outside lights over here...

25:31.930 --> 25:33.454
What about them?

25:34.266 --> 25:36.928
They're shining right into our upstairs.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.095
I see how that could be annoying.

25:40.205 --> 25:42.730
Just till we get some curtains up.

25:45.110 --> 25:49.240
You know the arroyo back here
that runs along <i>everybody's</i> house?

25:49.347 --> 25:51.975
<i>There's</i> some
unsavory characters down there.

25:52.083 --> 25:56.884
You know, kids with nothing to do.
They tag stuff, vandalize.

25:56.988 --> 25:58.683
- Been some break-ins.
- Is that right?

25:58.790 --> 26:01.953
I got a teenage daughter who likes to
sneak out at night if I <i>don't</i> stay on top of it.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.755
- You know what I mean?
- I hear you.

26:03.862 --> 26:08.322
I bet you <i>don't</i> want them shining down
on your pool deck at night, either.

26:09.301 --> 26:10.461
I guess not.

26:10.569 --> 26:13.094
Celia, Marcus.

26:13.204 --> 26:17.038
This is Mr. Mattson.
<i>He's</i> the man on the other side of the fence.

26:17.142 --> 26:18.575
- Say hi.
- Hi.

26:20.078 --> 26:23.138
- All right. See you, guys.
- Bye, Dad.

26:27.953 --> 26:29.716
Thanks for your time.

26:40.498 --> 26:42.693
- Okay, get out of the way. Move.
- No, <i>don't</i> kick the ball.

26:42.801 --> 26:43.893
Move!

26:45.337 --> 26:48.238
You're stupid! <i>What'd</i> you do that for?

26:48.340 --> 26:50.137
Now the <i>lady's</i> coming.

26:53.345 --> 26:54.676
Hello?

26:55.480 --> 26:56.606
Hey.

27:00.185 --> 27:01.652
She did it.

27:03.822 --> 27:05.289
Come get it.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.391
- Dad never let us over here.
- Why not?

27:12.163 --> 27:13.755
He <i>don't</i> want us being freeloaders.

27:13.865 --> 27:15.696
<i>That's</i> a good thing to not be.

27:15.800 --> 27:18.268
You <i>don't</i> even know what a freeloader is.

27:18.370 --> 27:20.304
Somebody that can swim in this pool.

27:20.405 --> 27:23.101
Well, you guys can swim here
anytime you want.

27:23.208 --> 27:25.699
- You just need to ask your parents.
- Parent.

27:25.810 --> 27:27.277
Our mom died.

27:29.648 --> 27:30.979
<i>I'm</i> sorry.

27:31.983 --> 27:35.009
- So <i>it's</i> just you guys and your dad?
- Yeah.

27:35.120 --> 27:37.350
But he has enough rules for two people.

27:37.455 --> 27:40.947
Yeah, well, <i>that's</i> how dads are.
It'll get better as you get older.

27:41.059 --> 27:43.186
No. He will never change his mind.

27:43.294 --> 27:46.786
What he says is what goes,
and the more you argue, the more <i>he's</i> like,

27:46.898 --> 27:49.128
<i>"Excuse me? I am the law."</i>

27:51.069 --> 27:53.367
Anyways, I like your hair.

27:54.773 --> 27:56.741
Thank you. <i>I'm</i> Lisa.

27:57.308 --> 27:58.332
Celia.

27:58.443 --> 28:00.536
- And you are?
- <i>I'm</i> Marcus.

28:00.645 --> 28:01.976
Nice to meet you.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.844
- So, Celia, can you do me a favor?
- Sure.

28:04.949 --> 28:07.440
My husband and I are having
a housewarming party here on Friday

28:07.552 --> 28:11.545
and I would love it if you and your dad
and Marcus all came over

28:11.656 --> 28:13.214
so we could kind of get acquainted.

28:13.324 --> 28:15.383
You <i>don't</i> have to invite Marcus.

28:15.493 --> 28:17.154
She already did.

28:18.963 --> 28:20.828
So I'll see you Friday.

28:20.932 --> 28:22.399
- Okay.
- Yes.

28:22.500 --> 28:23.626
Okay.

28:24.169 --> 28:25.568
Nice to meet you guys.

28:25.670 --> 28:26.762
- Bye.
- Bye.

28:26.871 --> 28:27.963
Bye.

28:48.693 --> 28:51.321
Okay, okay, okay.

28:54.899 --> 28:56.560
- Hey.
- Hello there.

28:56.668 --> 28:57.726
Late night?

28:57.836 --> 29:01.431
Well, you know, big town.
A lot of people to suck up to.

29:02.607 --> 29:04.598
So, honey, these are...

29:06.044 --> 29:08.410
Did you talk to him about the lights?

29:08.513 --> 29:12.210
Yeah. <i>He's</i> gonna take care of it.

29:14.185 --> 29:16.915
- <i>I'm</i> gonna go talk to him.
- No, I'll do it. Here, let me.

29:17.021 --> 29:20.115
- No, because you...
- Let me handle it. Please.

29:21.993 --> 29:23.620
- Okay.
- All right.

29:24.896 --> 29:26.124
Be nice.

29:27.198 --> 29:29.462
- I am nice.
- And <i>don't</i> be all...

29:30.168 --> 29:32.102
You know, 'cause he's...

29:32.203 --> 29:33.397
What?

29:34.806 --> 29:36.774
<i>'Cause he's</i> a brother.

29:36.875 --> 29:39.469
<i>He's</i> your brother? I <i>didn't</i> know that.

29:41.546 --> 29:42.638
Chris.

29:56.528 --> 29:57.688
Jesus.

30:10.809 --> 30:11.798
Chris, <i>what's</i> up?

30:11.910 --> 30:13.207
Hey, Abel.

30:14.212 --> 30:15.679
Your lights?

30:16.815 --> 30:19.511
You know, I did not get to that today.

30:20.952 --> 30:22.681
<i>Can't</i> you just turn them off?

30:22.787 --> 30:24.687
No. You know, they're on a master timer

30:24.789 --> 30:27.417
with the rest of the outdoor lights,
sprinklers.

30:27.525 --> 30:31.393
<i>I'd</i> have to do that whole instruction
manual thing, you know?

30:32.397 --> 30:33.887
- Right.
- <i>There's</i> no excuse, you know.

30:33.998 --> 30:36.057
I just had a hell of a day.

30:36.167 --> 30:37.759
No, I know what you mean.

30:37.869 --> 30:39.393
Want a beer?

30:39.504 --> 30:40.994
No. Thanks.

30:41.639 --> 30:42.799
But...

30:44.576 --> 30:45.907
You'll...

30:50.515 --> 30:51.914
Thanks.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.153
Chris, wait. Hold it.

30:56.254 --> 30:59.155
Be right with you, wait a minute. All right?

31:16.541 --> 31:20.033
Let me take you on patrol with me,
show you the neighborhood.

31:20.144 --> 31:21.270
Okay.

31:25.350 --> 31:26.908
Sure the neighbors appreciate this.

31:27.018 --> 31:30.784
Well, not everybody up <i>here's</i>
somebody you wanna live next to.

31:30.889 --> 31:31.913
Like who?

31:32.023 --> 31:33.285
This guy here, for instance.

31:33.391 --> 31:36.656
Sakorsky, Sakwasky, whatever.
Beats on his wife.

31:37.996 --> 31:40.191
I told her to come straight to me, but...

31:40.298 --> 31:42.630
You know, she <i>didn't</i> have to live that way.

31:42.734 --> 31:43.758
Did she...

31:43.868 --> 31:46.200
Well, other <i>people's</i> relationships.

31:46.304 --> 31:48.238
You think somebody
<i>shouldn't</i> be with somebody,

31:48.339 --> 31:51.604
but you <i>can't</i> say that to their face,
now can you?

31:53.211 --> 31:54.200
Yup.

31:54.312 --> 31:58.942
Over here, now, got some dealing going on,
I think, you know?

31:59.050 --> 32:03.453
Pills, weed, maybe a little coke, meth.
A lot of coming and going.

32:04.355 --> 32:06.585
Interesting thing is

32:06.691 --> 32:10.787
<i>guy's</i> got a different car
in the driveway every week.

32:11.996 --> 32:13.987
Maybe <i>he's</i> a car dealer.

32:20.672 --> 32:23.232
So <i>what'd</i> they tell you about the hillside?

32:23.341 --> 32:25.002
Behind the house?

32:25.777 --> 32:28.143
Said there was a slide 10 years ago,

32:28.246 --> 32:32.706
county reinforced it, and now they're
clearing it out for condos or whatever.

32:32.817 --> 32:35.718
Yeah. Hope they knew what they were doing.

32:36.888 --> 32:40.380
Look, Abel, we're here. Okay?

32:41.359 --> 32:43.020
And we're counting
on being here a few years.

32:43.127 --> 32:45.721
We really want this to be our home.

32:46.731 --> 32:48.858
- Raise your family?
- Yeah, eventually.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.060
<i>Don't</i> wanna rush it, though, right?

32:51.169 --> 32:53.137
Whenever we decide, <i>that's</i> our choice.

32:53.237 --> 32:54.898
You and your wife?

32:55.006 --> 32:56.837
Who <i>else's</i> would it be?

32:59.310 --> 33:01.175
<i>It's</i> a brave new world.

33:01.679 --> 33:03.044
<i>How's</i> that?

33:04.182 --> 33:07.083
You know, I got nothing against you. Or her.

33:07.352 --> 33:11.846
LAPD. I work with all kinds.
<i>I'd</i> lay my life down for those guys.

33:11.956 --> 33:14.686
- "All <i>kinds?"</i>
- But <i>that's</i> where I work.

33:14.792 --> 33:16.851
This is where I live.

33:18.262 --> 33:21.231
<i>I'm</i> trying to raise these kids by myself.

33:21.332 --> 33:24.495
Teach them to respect themselves
and the people they come from.

33:24.602 --> 33:26.069
So I <i>don't</i> need you or your lady

33:26.170 --> 33:29.071
putting your bedroom scenes
out here for them to see.

33:29.173 --> 33:34.236
I <i>don't</i> think they're ever going to forget that
little synchronized swimming exhibition.

33:34.345 --> 33:35.710
Me, either.

33:36.047 --> 33:37.605
Look, Abel, <i>I'm</i> sorry. I...

33:37.715 --> 33:40.513
Maybe <i>there's</i> places where <i>that's</i> okay.

33:40.618 --> 33:43.348
And maybe <i>that's</i> where you ought to live.

34:02.840 --> 34:04.034
Hey.

34:07.211 --> 34:09.202
They saw us. Last night.

34:10.447 --> 34:13.110
- What do you mean?
- In the pool.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.275
Him, the kids...

34:15.953 --> 34:18.751
Oh, my God. <i>I'm</i> mortified.

34:20.257 --> 34:22.748
Well, I <i>don't</i> think he likes us anyway.

34:22.860 --> 34:24.953
Well, honey,
<i>it's</i> not the best first impression.

34:25.063 --> 34:30.000
No, I mean, I <i>don't</i> think he likes
the idea of us together as a couple.

34:31.768 --> 34:33.396
Did he say that?

34:34.505 --> 34:36.199
In so many words.

34:36.808 --> 34:40.072
- Then why would you say that?
- Because I just know.

34:42.813 --> 34:45.647
<i>It's</i> not like your <i>dad's</i> my biggest fan.

34:46.617 --> 34:48.608
Okay. <i>There's</i> a leap.

34:48.719 --> 34:52.382
No, I... Just something I picked up on.

34:52.489 --> 34:55.425
- Because your parents are perfect.
- My parents love you.

34:55.525 --> 34:59.986
Oh, yeah, they must, because they say it
to my face every time they see me.

35:00.331 --> 35:02.322
<i>That's</i> a little harsh.

35:02.834 --> 35:04.631
Come on, we said we <i>wouldn't</i> do this,
remember?

35:04.735 --> 35:06.965
You are making assumptions about this guy.
You <i>don't</i> even know him.

35:07.071 --> 35:09.562
I just walked around
the entire neighborhood with the guy.

35:09.674 --> 35:11.005
I think I know him better than you do.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.100
Chris, you <i>don't</i> know him.

35:13.511 --> 35:15.479
- Oh, come on.
- You don't.

35:15.580 --> 35:16.706
- You're right.
- Whatever.

35:16.814 --> 35:19.476
No, look. You're right.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.648
I <i>don't</i> know him.

35:24.689 --> 35:26.281
Guess I never will.

35:29.160 --> 35:31.025
- <i>I'm</i> off to bed.
- Okay.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.894
<i>He's</i> still not gonna shut off the lights.

35:59.724 --> 36:00.782
Lis, <i>where's</i> your bathroom?

36:00.892 --> 36:03.053
Down the hall, to the right.

36:06.330 --> 36:07.797
I'll get it.

36:12.503 --> 36:13.731
- Abel.
- Chris, hey.

36:13.838 --> 36:16.170
Welcome. Nice jacket.

36:16.274 --> 36:18.105
Yeah, I like it.

36:18.209 --> 36:20.769
Mr. Turner, <i>I'm</i> Lisa, <i>Chris'</i> wife.

36:20.878 --> 36:22.368
Abel, please.

36:24.782 --> 36:25.908
And where are your kids?

36:26.017 --> 36:27.814
They could not come.

36:28.386 --> 36:30.479
- I'll take a drink, though.
- Okay.

36:30.588 --> 36:32.579
Right this way. What are you having?

36:32.690 --> 36:33.714
Anything wet.

36:33.824 --> 36:35.155
Well, we have a lot of that.

36:35.259 --> 36:37.250
- Wet and cold.
- Okay.

36:39.363 --> 36:41.331
- Hey, Chris.
- What?

36:41.432 --> 36:43.195
You hit the total jackpot, man.

36:43.301 --> 36:45.326
I so want to date a black girl.

36:45.436 --> 36:48.496
<i>I'm</i> working my way up, though,
doing the Pacific Rim thing right now,

36:48.606 --> 36:50.904
if you get what I mean.

36:51.008 --> 36:52.999
Well, good luck with that.

36:57.348 --> 37:00.283
You know, I heard something
on the news about fires.

37:00.384 --> 37:03.046
- Where?
- Around Santa Clarita.

37:03.588 --> 37:06.079
- <i>It's</i> global warming.
- Totally. This is not even normal.

37:06.190 --> 37:07.623
Yeah. We gotta study the problem further.

37:07.725 --> 37:10.159
<i>Don't</i> wanna jump to conclusions.
<i>Wouldn't</i> be right.

37:10.261 --> 37:12.559
<i>He's</i> right. It <i>wouldn't</i> be right.

37:12.663 --> 37:14.062
Code red. Blue state.

37:14.165 --> 37:16.326
A hundred-something degrees?

37:16.834 --> 37:18.665
<i>It's</i> snowing at the South Pole.

37:18.769 --> 37:20.737
And <i>it's</i> hot in Africa.

37:22.506 --> 37:25.304
What? I just mean <i>that's</i> normal, right?

37:28.646 --> 37:32.343
Anyway, there is an awful lot of
evidence piling up, so...

37:32.450 --> 37:34.850
That something you studied up
at Berkeley, Chris?

37:34.952 --> 37:37.284
No, Abel, just something <i>I'm</i> interested in.

37:37.388 --> 37:38.685
Oh, so you're not an expert?

37:38.789 --> 37:41.383
I mean, you work for, like,
a grocery store chain

37:41.492 --> 37:43.653
or something like that, right?

37:43.761 --> 37:47.219
Yeah, with a pretty strong
environmental agenda.

37:47.331 --> 37:50.960
Timeout. Debate over.
I <i>don't</i> even know what that means.

37:55.806 --> 37:58.536
- Well, what do you do, Abel?
- I am a police officer.

37:58.643 --> 38:00.508
- Oh, you are?
- Yes, sir.

38:00.611 --> 38:02.636
Well, Chris, hide the pot.

38:03.614 --> 38:05.377
Not the pot <i>I'm</i> worried about.

38:05.483 --> 38:10.352
<i>It's</i> those cigarette butts he keeps
flicking over the fence so the wife <i>won't</i> see.

38:11.489 --> 38:13.548
Dude, you're so busted.

38:14.992 --> 38:16.152
Really?

38:18.329 --> 38:19.921
Where do you patrol, Abel?

38:20.031 --> 38:23.159
<i>I'm</i> assigned to
the Valley Bureau of the LAPD,

38:23.267 --> 38:24.859
over near Panorama City.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.766
You know where that is?

38:26.871 --> 38:28.236
Yes. I think.

38:28.339 --> 38:29.670
Been there?

38:30.408 --> 38:32.171
- Never been.
- Come on down.

38:32.276 --> 38:34.039
We'll show you some things.

38:34.145 --> 38:35.612
Like how to be an asshole.

38:35.713 --> 38:38.739
<i>I'm</i> sorry,
is there something you wanna say?

38:38.849 --> 38:39.838
No.

38:39.950 --> 38:42.544
But you seem to have an opinion about
law enforcement. <i>I'd</i> like to hear it.

38:42.653 --> 38:44.553
- Oh, <i>let's</i> talk about something else.
- Oh, no, no, no.

38:44.655 --> 38:45.781
We could talk about something else,

38:45.890 --> 38:49.121
but I think your friends
wanna talk about this.

38:51.329 --> 38:54.093
I just find that <i>there's</i> an attitude.

38:56.467 --> 39:01.404
You know, a kind of aggressiveness
when you deal with them.

39:01.505 --> 39:03.097
Which I can certainly understand.

39:03.207 --> 39:04.834
<i>I'm</i> sorry, Miss...

39:04.942 --> 39:06.534
- Eden.
- Eden.

39:07.645 --> 39:10.580
Well, Eden, when you're getting
jacked outside your loft

39:10.681 --> 39:13.616
and Dubya here <i>doesn't</i> have

39:14.852 --> 39:17.116
the energy to stop it,

39:17.221 --> 39:20.088
we'll see about sending
the nice police over to help you.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.386
<i>That's</i> if <i>it's</i> not too late.

39:24.428 --> 39:27.158
- Oh, what is this?
- White zinfandel.

39:27.698 --> 39:30.394
- <i>It's</i> very refreshing.
- Oh, good.

39:30.501 --> 39:33.436
Well, <i>it's</i> getting late.

39:33.537 --> 39:35.903
Chris, Lisa, thanks for inviting me.

39:36.006 --> 39:37.940
<i>It's</i> been enlightening.

39:38.909 --> 39:40.308
Night, all.

39:42.446 --> 39:44.277
<i>Don't</i> drink and drive.

39:49.987 --> 39:51.545
What time is it?

39:53.724 --> 39:55.123
Yeah, <i>let's</i> go.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.887
<i>That's</i> fresh dill.

39:58.229 --> 39:59.787
Abel, hold on.

40:00.364 --> 40:05.233
Look, the cigarettes, <i>I'm</i> sorry.
I <i>wasn't</i> thinking. I apologize.

40:05.336 --> 40:07.634
But in front of my wife?

40:07.738 --> 40:10.229
<i>That's</i> really not cool.

40:10.808 --> 40:12.400
You <i>didn't</i> like that?

40:12.510 --> 40:13.943
No, I didn't.

40:14.345 --> 40:17.439
And whatever it is about me,
or us, that bothers you,

40:17.548 --> 40:20.312
we gotta figure out a way to deal with this.
All right?

40:20.418 --> 40:22.511
So, what do you propose?

40:23.387 --> 40:25.617
- What?
- <i>What's</i> your agenda?

40:26.357 --> 40:27.915
My agenda is...

40:29.293 --> 40:30.692
<i>Can't</i> we all just get along?

40:30.795 --> 40:33.855
Oh, not Rodney King.
You playing the race card?

40:34.932 --> 40:38.333
Come on, man, this is getting a little
out of hand, I mean...

40:38.436 --> 40:39.835
I need you to back off.

40:39.937 --> 40:41.199
Back off?

40:42.139 --> 40:43.663
Yeah, a little.

40:44.742 --> 40:46.232
Or what?

40:47.812 --> 40:49.245
See, you keep saying stuff like that.

40:49.346 --> 40:52.577
Like we're not welcome here,
we should move.

40:52.683 --> 40:54.173
But we're fitting in just fine.

40:54.285 --> 40:55.718
Says who?

40:57.688 --> 40:59.280
Maybe you're the one with the problem.

40:59.390 --> 41:01.881
- I <i>don't</i> smoke.
- You know what?

41:01.992 --> 41:04.927
I said I was sorry. Just stay out of my life.

41:05.629 --> 41:07.460
Stay out of your life?

41:19.310 --> 41:21.608
You have a good night, Chris.

41:47.071 --> 41:48.663
Jesus...

41:49.139 --> 41:51.471
What is it with this neighborhood?

41:51.976 --> 41:55.707
<i>It's</i> like they hate us.

41:59.917 --> 42:02.977
Oh, honey? Is that the Prius?

42:06.924 --> 42:08.448
Honey, do you see anything?

42:08.559 --> 42:10.459
No. Hit the lights.

42:10.561 --> 42:11.721
Okay.

42:12.830 --> 42:15.663
Hey, babe? Did you leave this door open?

42:17.334 --> 42:18.460
No.

42:22.006 --> 42:23.473
Oh, shit.

42:23.574 --> 42:25.337
The tires are flat.

42:26.677 --> 42:28.269
They're slashed.

42:29.113 --> 42:30.239
Shit.

42:31.448 --> 42:33.780
- What are you...
- Move, move.

42:36.120 --> 42:38.748
Chris! Chris, what are you doing?

42:39.490 --> 42:40.855
God damn it.

42:43.994 --> 42:45.985
Well, whoever it is, they're gone.

42:46.096 --> 42:48.121
Everything okay over there?

42:50.834 --> 42:54.201
I thought I heard somebody moving
around over there.

42:54.738 --> 42:56.365
Did you see anyone?

42:56.707 --> 42:57.833
No.

42:58.475 --> 43:00.102
I just see you.

43:03.047 --> 43:05.572
So you're just not gonna
do anything about it?

43:05.683 --> 43:08.652
<i>I'm</i> sorry, ma'am,
<i>there's</i> just not much we can do.

43:08.752 --> 43:12.210
Abel, Officer Turner,
he said he heard some noises.

43:12.323 --> 43:14.587
Sounded like somebody moving
along the side of your house.

43:14.692 --> 43:15.852
<i>I'm</i> sure he did.

43:15.960 --> 43:18.861
Well, you get some late-night traffic
from the arroyo back there.

43:18.963 --> 43:21.989
Bunch of kids with nothing better to do
than make other <i>people's</i> lives miserable.

43:22.099 --> 43:24.499
Yeah, I keep hearing about them.

43:25.369 --> 43:28.770
<i>That's</i> not much
of a lock on that door there.

43:28.872 --> 43:31.534
But we'll take a swing around,
you know, see what we see.

43:31.642 --> 43:33.769
It <i>wasn't</i> kids in the arroyo.

43:34.745 --> 43:36.440
Then what was it?

43:40.117 --> 43:44.451
Well, if you hear any other noises, ma'am,
<i>I'm</i> sorry, just give us a call, okay?

43:44.555 --> 43:47.956
You guys are lucky.
You have a cop living next door.

43:48.626 --> 43:52.221
Thank you, Officer.
Thank you for all your help.

43:53.564 --> 43:55.759
- Thanks, guys, for coming out.
- Hey, we can come on back.

43:55.866 --> 43:57.333
Stay alert out there, all right?

43:57.434 --> 43:59.834
I guess we could dust for prints.

44:12.216 --> 44:14.741
Honey, next time, use an ashtray.

44:17.354 --> 44:19.720
How do you even know <i>it's</i> mine?

44:26.964 --> 44:29.797
- Do you have any proof?
- Not exactly.

44:29.900 --> 44:32.892
But he told us we <i>weren't</i> welcome in
the neighborhood. <i>That's</i> what he told me.

44:33.003 --> 44:34.334
He refused to turn off his floodlights,

44:34.438 --> 44:37.669
<i>he's</i> made these implications
about Lisa and me,

44:37.775 --> 44:41.108
and he was standing right there
after the whole car tire thing, just waiting.

44:41.211 --> 44:43.543
Honey, do you have any proof?

44:46.083 --> 44:50.417
Chris just answered that, Daddy.
No. No, not exactly, but...

44:50.521 --> 44:52.614
The way it seems to me,

44:52.723 --> 44:56.022
the man never made an actual threat
against your life or property.

44:56.126 --> 44:57.821
So <i>it's</i> his word against yours.

44:57.928 --> 45:01.193
And he has, <i>let's</i> say,
the color issue on his side.

45:02.166 --> 45:04.828
And that color happens to be blue.

45:05.936 --> 45:09.064
As for the lights, you could file a civil suit.

45:09.173 --> 45:10.697
I <i>wouldn't</i> advise it.

45:10.808 --> 45:13.538
These things have a knack
for turning out badly.

45:13.644 --> 45:14.941
Yeah, but why do we
have to be the ones to...

45:15.045 --> 45:17.513
That was my professional opinion.

45:18.115 --> 45:19.912
<i>What's</i> the point of carrying on with this?

45:20.017 --> 45:23.350
You bought this as a starter home.
Fine, you started.

45:23.754 --> 45:27.053
Put it back on the market.
You take a loss, so what?

45:27.991 --> 45:32.155
Then you can do what we wanted you to do,
which is let us help you.

45:32.262 --> 45:33.991
Harold, do you think you
could just have the courtesy

45:34.098 --> 45:36.760
of including me in the conversation?

45:42.973 --> 45:45.339
Are you going to have children?

45:46.276 --> 45:47.265
What?

45:47.377 --> 45:50.574
Daddy, <i>that's</i> not what we came here
to talk to you about.

45:50.681 --> 45:54.310
Chris wants me to address him.
This is <i>what's</i> on my mind.

45:56.153 --> 45:59.281
You plan to have children
with my daughter?

45:59.389 --> 46:00.686
Yes, I do.

46:00.791 --> 46:02.418
We do. I do. Yes.

46:03.093 --> 46:05.561
How do you intend to protect them?

46:06.063 --> 46:08.395
How am I going to protect them?

46:12.803 --> 46:15.135
Well, <i>I'm</i> gonna get a gun, Harold.

46:15.706 --> 46:19.301
<i>I'm</i> going to amass an arsenal.
A lot of firepower.

46:20.210 --> 46:22.201
<i>How's</i> that work for you?

46:24.047 --> 46:25.981
Excuse me for a moment.

46:38.095 --> 46:40.063
Wow, look at that.

46:42.232 --> 46:45.258
- <i>It's</i> worse than this morning.
- Yeah, I know.

46:47.538 --> 46:50.029
Are we gonna talk about this at all?

46:50.674 --> 46:51.868
What?

46:52.676 --> 46:57.204
Oh, well.
<i>There's</i> a 10-day grace period on firearms,

46:57.314 --> 46:59.077
so I got lights.

47:01.752 --> 47:06.587
And do we think that this is the right thing
to do to solve the problem?

47:06.690 --> 47:09.090
Oh, I <i>don't</i> think <i>it's</i> gonna solve anything.

47:09.193 --> 47:11.855
But <i>I'm</i> gonna enjoy the shit out of it.

47:12.830 --> 47:15.594
Okay. Let me know if you need any help.

47:15.699 --> 47:16.757
Okay.

47:52.436 --> 47:54.631
Man, I am so totally burnt right now.

47:54.738 --> 47:57.400
- Late night?
- Yeah, Connie kept me up.

47:57.507 --> 48:00.340
Yeah, I seem to remember
something like that.

48:00.444 --> 48:03.572
No, <i>it's</i> she wants out of Boyle Heights.

48:04.348 --> 48:05.440
You know, <i>she's</i> right, man.

48:05.549 --> 48:09.383
You <i>can't</i> be living around
the people you got to be arresting.

48:09.920 --> 48:12.013
Wife ever bust your chops
about moving up?

48:12.122 --> 48:13.180
- Jocelyn?
- Yeah.

48:13.290 --> 48:17.226
Never gave her a chance, man.
I was busting my hump for her.

48:18.195 --> 48:23.132
Eight years of double shifts,
all the overtime I could drag down,

48:23.233 --> 48:27.329
extra security jobs, taking all the shit details
nobody else wanted.

48:28.505 --> 48:30.097
I grew up in South Central.

48:30.207 --> 48:32.607
<i>There's</i> no way
I was gonna raise my kids there.

48:32.709 --> 48:36.406
<i>Now's</i> the time to get out, you know.
They'll be gone before you know it.

48:36.513 --> 48:38.743
<i>It's</i> the perfect opportunity.

48:39.182 --> 48:42.151
- <i>That's</i> why <i>I'm</i> taking the exam.
- What <i>exam's</i> that?

48:42.252 --> 48:43.844
Detective exam.

48:44.354 --> 48:48.620
Get off the street, bump up a pay grade.
About 15 years, and <i>I'm</i> out.

48:48.725 --> 48:52.354
<i>'Cause I don't</i> really wanna be
doing this stuff when I'm...

48:52.729 --> 48:55.425
I just <i>don't</i> love the job the way you do.

48:57.868 --> 49:02.066
<i>Unit 51, we have a 4-15 in progress.</i>
<i>Male suspect, possible shots fired.</i>

49:02.172 --> 49:04.470
<i>137 South Oxford Street.</i>

49:04.574 --> 49:07.042
Pop the siren, detective sergeant.

49:07.144 --> 49:09.009
Unit 51, 10-4.

49:10.814 --> 49:12.281
About time.

49:15.852 --> 49:16.978
Who called the cops?

49:17.087 --> 49:20.614
<i>He's</i> got his wife and his little girl in there,
yelling about how he gonna kill them both.

49:20.724 --> 49:23.352
- Have any weapons?
- Yeah, yeah, I think <i>he's</i> got a gun.

49:23.460 --> 49:25.985
He <i>didn't</i> open the door
and I <i>wasn't</i> staying to find out.

49:26.096 --> 49:28.587
Okay, what apartment number is it?

49:29.166 --> 49:31.657
Apartment seven.
Straight back in the corner.

49:31.768 --> 49:33.292
- Left?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right.

49:33.403 --> 49:35.928
- <i>What's</i> his name?
- Damon Richards.

49:37.474 --> 49:39.942
- Keep these people back.
- All right.

49:47.250 --> 49:48.649
Get inside.

49:54.358 --> 49:56.383
What? <i>I'm</i> poor, okay! What? Look at me!

49:56.493 --> 49:58.393
Trying to say you're better than me now?

49:58.495 --> 49:59.928
<i>I'm</i> not talking about my baby!

50:00.030 --> 50:03.124
- You know what? Forget him and you!
- Please hurry.

50:03.233 --> 50:06.464
You can take this damn baby away!
I <i>don't</i> need it!

50:07.170 --> 50:10.298
Both of you!
You're just a strain on my finances.

50:10.407 --> 50:12.307
LAPD, Mr. Richards.

50:12.442 --> 50:15.104
- Man, get away from my door!
- Listen, my name is Abel.

50:15.212 --> 50:18.238
I wanna know if your wife
and child are safe, okay?

50:18.348 --> 50:21.146
Man, <i>don't</i> worry about them!
Get away from my door!

50:21.251 --> 50:23.583
Listen, Damon, <i>let's</i> talk about this.

50:23.687 --> 50:25.416
Man, we <i>ain't</i> gonna talk about nothing!

50:25.522 --> 50:28.320
We can play this any way you want, okay?

50:28.825 --> 50:30.622
<i>Let's</i> just keep talking, all right?

50:30.727 --> 50:32.922
Make sure everything is cool inside,
all right?

50:33.030 --> 50:34.156
Gun!

50:36.933 --> 50:38.662
- Oh, my baby.
- You okay?

50:38.769 --> 50:39.827
No!

50:40.437 --> 50:41.597
- Damon! Stop!
- <i>Everything's</i> gonna be okay.

50:41.705 --> 50:43.366
- Just stay there.
- Officer, wait! Please <i>don't</i> hurt him!

50:43.473 --> 50:45.100
- Stop!
- <i>He's</i> a good guy!

50:45.208 --> 50:46.800
Our <i>guy's</i> on the ground!
<i>He's</i> out the window!

50:46.910 --> 50:49.879
- Call for backup!
- Hey! Stay back! Sit down!

50:49.980 --> 50:51.277
- No! No!
- Stay back!

50:51.381 --> 50:53.906
- Please! Please, just let him go, Officer.
- Unit 51 requesting assistance.

50:54.017 --> 50:55.177
Man with a gun.

51:13.270 --> 51:15.932
Give it up, Damon! Come on, give it up!

51:16.973 --> 51:21.376
Stop, Damon! Stop right there!
Put the gun down! End of the line! Hold it!

51:21.478 --> 51:24.174
<i>Don't</i> come closer! <i>Don't</i> come closer!

51:24.281 --> 51:25.578
I swear to God I'll do it!

51:25.682 --> 51:27.149
Okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay.

51:27.250 --> 51:28.683
- <i>Don't</i> come closer!
- <i>Let's</i> talk about this, all right?

51:28.785 --> 51:29.979
- Calm down, calm down, calm down.
- I'll do it!

51:30.087 --> 51:31.748
- Take it easy. Take it easy, okay?
- I'll do it. I'll do it!

51:31.855 --> 51:35.086
We can talk about this. All right?
There you go.

51:35.992 --> 51:37.584
- What are you doing?
- Now stop bullshitting.

51:37.694 --> 51:38.661
You wanna do this, do it.

51:38.762 --> 51:42.198
Come on, stop playing. Stop bullshitting.
Go ahead, do it! Do it!

51:42.299 --> 51:44.096
Come on! What, you need some help?

51:44.201 --> 51:46.396
- Move your finger. Move your finger!
- No! No!

51:46.503 --> 51:48.562
Give me the goddamn gun then!

51:48.672 --> 51:50.196
Up! Get up!

51:52.275 --> 51:54.709
Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes!

51:55.212 --> 51:56.907
Is this gonna happen again?

51:57.013 --> 51:58.037
- No!
- What?

51:58.148 --> 52:00.639
No, sir! No! I swear to God, no!

52:00.750 --> 52:02.342
God <i>ain't</i> here, you swear to me.

52:02.452 --> 52:04.283
I swear. I swear to you, sir!

52:04.387 --> 52:08.585
Now, you be a man, understand?
You take your responsibility.

52:08.692 --> 52:13.254
I <i>don't</i> give a shit what your situation is!
You be a father to that baby, you got me?

52:13.363 --> 52:14.489
Abel!

52:14.998 --> 52:16.124
If I have to come back here,

52:16.233 --> 52:18.258
<i>I'm</i> gonna be the one doing the shooting,
you understand?

52:18.368 --> 52:19.596
Yes, sir.

52:19.703 --> 52:21.466
- Detective Villareal.
- Yes, sir.

52:21.571 --> 52:24.165
Put some restraints on this young man.

52:24.808 --> 52:27.606
- But do it gently, please.
- Absolutely.

52:31.715 --> 52:35.378
You heard him. Come on.
<i>Let's</i> go. Come on!

53:04.214 --> 53:05.238
Hey.

53:06.550 --> 53:07.676
What are you doing?

53:07.784 --> 53:09.081
You said any time.

53:09.186 --> 53:13.418
Yeah, if your dad said it was okay, Celia.
I have a feeling he didn't.

53:21.565 --> 53:24.125
- How old are you?
- Fifteen.

53:24.234 --> 53:26.464
You're a very brave girl.

53:26.570 --> 53:28.936
Make sure you ask
your dad next time, okay?

53:29.039 --> 53:30.631
Yeah. Right.

53:33.577 --> 53:35.943
Hey, can I ask you a question?

53:37.247 --> 53:38.271
Sure.

53:38.381 --> 53:41.009
- You got me.
- So, in school <i>there's</i> a lot of hooking up.

53:41.117 --> 53:42.277
Okay.

53:42.385 --> 53:45.149
And if a black guy goes out
with a white girl,

53:45.255 --> 53:47.485
his boys are like, "Dawg, you the <i>shit."</i>

53:47.591 --> 53:48.580
Right.

53:48.692 --> 53:52.788
But other way around and they're on you.
<i>"Sister"</i> this, "sister" that.

53:52.896 --> 53:55.797
- Is that <i>what's</i> going on with you?
- <i>There's</i> this guy.

53:55.899 --> 53:57.127
And you like him?

53:57.234 --> 54:00.362
Well, it depends.
How much do I have to like him?

54:02.439 --> 54:07.399
Well, if <i>he's</i> gonna be your boyfriend
you should probably really like him.

54:07.510 --> 54:10.877
Especially if <i>he's</i> white,
because it may not be easy.

54:12.983 --> 54:16.714
But you like who you like, right?

54:16.820 --> 54:18.583
- Yeah.
- All right.

54:19.422 --> 54:21.982
- Hey, what is this?
- <i>Destiny's</i> Child.

54:24.160 --> 54:26.958
- Okay. I think I've heard this.
- You think?

54:28.698 --> 54:30.495
<i>It's</i> nice. I like it.

54:31.368 --> 54:34.269
No, I think I gotta move to this. Wait.

54:34.371 --> 54:37.499
Oh, my gosh! I feel so old.

54:48.184 --> 54:49.811
- Come on, take it.
- No!

54:49.919 --> 54:52.547
You can shuffle around a little bit.

54:52.656 --> 54:53.850
Sure.

54:53.957 --> 54:57.324
Come on. You're not old.
You'll get it. Come on.

54:57.427 --> 55:00.294
No. No, no, no.
You are doing fine for the both of us.

55:00.397 --> 55:01.625
Come on!

55:01.731 --> 55:05.633
Oh, my gosh, you're a great dancer.

55:05.735 --> 55:07.532
- Come on, get down to it. Come on.
- No way!

55:07.637 --> 55:11.038
No! No. Absolutely not. <i>I'm</i> not doing that.

55:12.575 --> 55:14.600
- Remember this one?
- Who taught you that?

55:14.711 --> 55:17.077
- What do you know about that?
- My mom did. My mom taught me that.

55:17.180 --> 55:20.081
- Oh, my God. I feel so old.
- Come on!

55:20.183 --> 55:23.050
Did I give you permission
to come over here?

55:24.087 --> 55:25.281
Abel.

55:25.388 --> 55:27.253
Answer me, young lady.

55:30.560 --> 55:31.584
No, <i>I'm</i> just...

55:31.695 --> 55:35.187
No, I did not give you, my daughter,
permission to come over here

55:35.298 --> 55:37.289
because it matters to me
what you're learning

55:37.400 --> 55:38.594
and who you're learning it from.

55:38.702 --> 55:40.363
Okay, I told her she could come over

55:40.470 --> 55:42.700
- and swim whenever she wanted to.
- Oh, so what I say <i>doesn't</i> matter.

55:42.806 --> 55:44.034
<i>That's</i> not what I meant, Abel.

55:44.140 --> 55:46.335
No, no, no, no, no.
I understand where you're coming from.

55:46.443 --> 55:50.539
I need to be fresh and liberal

55:50.647 --> 55:53.138
and open to what other people think and do,
is that right, Lisa?

55:53.249 --> 55:55.513
- <i>That's</i> right.
- Okay. All right, then.

55:55.618 --> 55:58.553
Well, <i>let's</i> all get crazy.
<i>Let's</i> just get down then, huh?

55:58.655 --> 55:59.986
- What are you doing?
- Forget the rules, huh?

56:00.090 --> 56:01.557
- There are no rules.
- Abel...

56:01.658 --> 56:04.684
We make them up as we go along,
is that right, Lisa? I am right, <i>aren't</i> I?

56:04.794 --> 56:06.056
You've made your point, Abel.

56:06.162 --> 56:08.289
Whatever we wanna do,
<i>that's</i> all right, right?

56:08.398 --> 56:10.195
- <i>That's</i> enough.
- How you say it, baby girl?

56:10.300 --> 56:12.359
- Listen, you made your point.
- <i>Let's</i> get ill! This is sick!

56:12.469 --> 56:16.064
- Okay, Dad! All right!
- This is dope! <i>Let's</i> keep it gangsta! Holla!

56:16.172 --> 56:17.332
What?

56:18.041 --> 56:21.533
<i>It's</i> okay for you to parade around
in your underwear, but not me, huh?

56:21.644 --> 56:22.941
You know what that is?

56:23.046 --> 56:24.946
<i>That's</i> hypocrisy. <i>That's</i> a double standard.

56:25.048 --> 56:27.107
<i>There's</i> no room
in this world for that anymore.

56:27.217 --> 56:28.275
<i>Didn't</i> you teach her that, Lisa?

56:28.385 --> 56:29.750
I mean, you did teach her everything
you know, right?

56:29.853 --> 56:31.980
- No.
- She knows a shitload more than you do.

56:32.088 --> 56:33.919
- Okay, Celia...
- I beg your pardon?

56:34.023 --> 56:35.684
Stop messing with my life!

56:35.792 --> 56:38.386
Telling me what to do,
what to say, what to wear!

56:38.495 --> 56:41.225
You <i>don't</i> know anything about me,
who I am or what I think.

56:41.331 --> 56:44.926
You're just an old man with a badge on
and his pants off.

56:48.238 --> 56:51.765
Okay, Abel, that is not okay.

56:51.875 --> 56:53.274
<i>I'm</i> sorry.

56:53.777 --> 56:58.237
<i>I'm</i> not myself these days.
You know, <i>I'm</i> not sleeping very well.

56:58.348 --> 56:59.713
You have no right to hit her.

56:59.816 --> 57:04.810
Oh, <i>let's</i> you and me have a long discussion
about my parental rights, why <i>don't</i> we?

57:04.921 --> 57:06.548
Get off my property.

57:06.656 --> 57:08.089
Or what?

57:09.826 --> 57:11.589
You wanna call the cops?

57:11.694 --> 57:14.162
Here. I'll tell you <i>who's</i> on duty.

58:04.047 --> 58:06.174
You okay? You're not eating.

58:07.317 --> 58:09.512
My <i>stomach's</i> been funny all day.

58:09.619 --> 58:11.416
You getting the flu?

58:14.023 --> 58:15.581
Just tension.

58:22.031 --> 58:26.092
Maybe he finally got the message.
No lights tonight.

58:28.438 --> 58:30.167
<i>It's</i> nice out here.

58:31.140 --> 58:34.576
This place is gonna look really sweet
by the time we're done with it.

58:34.677 --> 58:38.238
Just about when we're ready
to put it back on the market.

58:42.151 --> 58:44.142
<i>I'm</i> sensing a theme here.

58:45.555 --> 58:48.524
Be honest with me.
You wanna sell this place?

58:48.625 --> 58:50.149
Do you?

58:50.260 --> 58:54.196
Why, I certainly <i>don't</i> want
anyone else deciding that for us.

58:55.198 --> 58:58.361
Not the guy next door. Not your father.

58:58.468 --> 59:00.800
They're not the same person, Chris.

59:00.904 --> 59:03.031
And you <i>don't</i> have to prove anything
to either one of them.

59:03.139 --> 59:04.663
Come on, I know that. Why <i>wouldn't</i> I...

59:04.774 --> 59:07.800
Okay, we'll just let that be your own
little transference deal.

59:07.911 --> 59:11.142
- We <i>won't</i> actually talk about that, I guess.
- What?

59:11.247 --> 59:12.271
<i>That's</i> what you think this is?

59:12.382 --> 59:14.373
Oh, <i>don't</i> get all <i>"I know..."</i>

59:14.484 --> 59:18.079
Come on, you know exactly
what <i>I'm</i> talking about. <i>Don't</i> do this.

59:18.187 --> 59:21.850
I am constantly taking shit from
black guys about our relationship.

59:21.958 --> 59:23.585
<i>"Constantly."</i>

59:24.694 --> 59:26.321
Constantly?

59:26.429 --> 59:28.454
Okay. Whatever. Lisa...

59:29.966 --> 59:33.834
It just gets exhausting
being on the front lines all the time.

59:39.309 --> 59:41.300
You have no idea.

59:41.411 --> 59:43.003
What does that mean?

59:43.112 --> 59:47.048
<i>I'm</i> just gonna go upstairs
and lie down and read my book, okay?

01:00:20.216 --> 01:00:21.706
Everything meet with your approval?

01:00:21.818 --> 01:00:24.082
You always did keep the place neat.

01:00:24.187 --> 01:00:27.054
Just <i>don't</i> seem to enjoy it much anymore.

01:00:28.057 --> 01:00:31.891
You just said something nice to me, right?
I mean, sort of?

01:00:32.996 --> 01:00:34.657
Hey, baby. You got everything?

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:37.528
Yup. <i>I'm</i> gonna ride
the horse this year, Aunt Dorrie.

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:40.660
- Are you asking or telling?
- Asking.

01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:43.603
Well, then I think we can manage that.

01:00:43.706 --> 01:00:47.107
- Giddyup, partner. And have fun, okay?
- Okay.

01:00:50.713 --> 01:00:52.544
<i>Don't</i> I get a goodbye?

01:00:53.049 --> 01:00:54.277
See you.

01:00:54.617 --> 01:00:56.050
Can we go?

01:01:02.558 --> 01:01:04.185
So, what was all that about?

01:01:04.293 --> 01:01:07.558
I <i>don't</i> know. <i>She's</i> 15 and female.
You tell me.

01:01:08.564 --> 01:01:09.531
Here.

01:01:09.632 --> 01:01:10.599
You can give this back to her

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:14.101
if you want her walking around
like a zombie child for the next two weeks.

01:01:14.203 --> 01:01:17.036
What is going on with you, Abel?
I mean, you seemed like you were fine.

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:19.938
Now all of a sudden, I <i>don't</i> know,
you seem different.

01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:23.911
I am fine, and I've always been different.
Never been better.

01:01:25.448 --> 01:01:27.575
See you, guys. Have fun.

01:01:36.592 --> 01:01:38.219
You okay in there?

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:50.699
<i>I'm</i> pregnant.

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:56.140
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:01:57.847 --> 01:01:59.542
I did three of them.

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:03.576
Should we call, or...

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:06.919
What about your pills?

01:02:07.023 --> 01:02:10.186
I might have missed a few. Maybe.

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:12.818
Well, either you did or you didn't.

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:15.490
I did. Okay?

01:02:16.265 --> 01:02:18.529
So... I did.

01:02:18.634 --> 01:02:20.431
I thought we were gonna wait.

01:02:20.536 --> 01:02:22.504
You <i>don't</i> always get
to choose this kind of thing, Chris.

01:02:22.605 --> 01:02:24.038
Yeah, you do, <i>that's</i> sort of the point.

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:27.769
Come on, you choose to take birth control,

01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:29.174
you can read the label and...

01:02:29.278 --> 01:02:31.838
- Come on, we had a plan.
- Our plan was to start a family.

01:02:31.948 --> 01:02:34.815
I <i>can't</i> believe you're not even
just a little bit happy about this.

01:02:34.917 --> 01:02:37.511
- Oh, come on, <i>that's</i> not fair.
- Well, you know, I didn't...

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.019
This is not some sort of sneak attack.

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:41.613
Right now,
you want to start a family right now?

01:02:41.724 --> 01:02:42.986
Right now? We just moved in!

01:02:43.092 --> 01:02:46.926
- <i>I'm</i> sorry. Is it not convenient for you?
- Oh, God! No, come on!

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:49.759
<i>It's</i> not about convenience.
<i>It's</i> a whole different life, you know?

01:02:49.866 --> 01:02:53.927
And what life is that, Chris?
The one where you're not married to me?

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:56.129
Come on, Lisa, <i>that's</i> not...

01:03:03.346 --> 01:03:05.541
I gotta go to work. <i>I'm</i> late.

01:03:08.684 --> 01:03:09.742
Bye.

01:03:21.998 --> 01:03:23.260
<i>What's</i> going on, Captain?

01:03:23.366 --> 01:03:25.891
Damon Richards. You know him?

01:03:26.002 --> 01:03:27.469
And you are?

01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:31.663
This is Bronson and Morgada. They're...

01:03:31.774 --> 01:03:33.298
Internal Affairs.

01:03:33.409 --> 01:03:36.845
Yeah. <i>It's</i> just a procedural thing, Abel.

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.277
So, what about Richards?

01:03:39.382 --> 01:03:43.443
We arrested him last week.
He took two shots at me and my partner.

01:03:43.953 --> 01:03:45.853
<i>He's</i> bringing a suit against the department.

01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:48.355
Brutality charges, violation of civil rights,

01:03:48.457 --> 01:03:50.288
as well as a personnel complaint
against you.

01:03:50.393 --> 01:03:53.760
<i>"Officer Turner used excessive force,
made threats <i>against..."</i></i>

01:03:53.863 --> 01:03:56.297
I gave that asshole a pass, Cap.
He took two shots at us.

01:03:56.399 --> 01:03:59.493
You were verbally abusive
and you left him with three broken ribs.

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:01.160
Not to mention shoving a gun in his face.

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:02.931
That is not accurate.

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:06.669
I talked to him.
I tried to educate the individual.

01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:08.505
I never struck him.

01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:11.876
If he was injured, that happened
when he was out of our custody.

01:04:11.981 --> 01:04:15.212
Look, this is all bullshit, Abel.

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:20.346
But this is what
we have to deal with now, right?

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:24.282
So finish your tour today,

01:04:24.393 --> 01:04:28.159
then take some time off
in lieu of disciplinary action.

01:04:28.264 --> 01:04:29.526
All right?

01:04:29.832 --> 01:04:32.665
- How much time?
- Until we tell you otherwise.

01:04:32.768 --> 01:04:34.998
Because, you know, frankly,
over the last few years,

01:04:35.104 --> 01:04:37.538
you have a number of question marks
on your record.

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:38.800
So I <i>wouldn't</i> push it.

01:04:38.908 --> 01:04:42.503
You should be thinking retirement.
<i>It's</i> about that time.

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:47.448
28 years. 28 years and this is what I get?

01:04:48.784 --> 01:04:51.014
What do you think you deserve?

01:05:09.805 --> 01:05:11.500
Heads up, heads up.

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:15.310
- <i>Don't</i> stop on my account.
- You <i>don't</i> wanna hear it, Abel.

01:05:15.411 --> 01:05:18.812
- I heard nigger jokes before.
- No, <i>it's</i> not that.

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:22.715
We're throwing a bachelor party
for Davis tonight.

01:05:22.818 --> 01:05:24.718
- And <i>I'm</i> not invited?
- Yeah, sure you are.

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:27.288
We just thought that, you know, it wasn't...

01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:29.654
We thought <i>it's</i> not your thing.

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:38.924
Tell you what,
why <i>don't</i> you bring it to my house, okay?

01:05:39.035 --> 01:05:41.503
No civilians, you can cut loose all night.

01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:42.935
What about the kids?

01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:46.805
They're doing their two-week bit
with my sister-in-law out in Lancaster.

01:05:46.909 --> 01:05:48.672
- Perfect timing.
- You really want to?

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:52.976
My <i>reputation's</i> on the line here.
Besides, I need a good lap dance.

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:56.650
- All right, <i>let's</i> do it.
- Now we got a place.

01:05:56.752 --> 01:05:57.878
We got a place.

01:06:46.802 --> 01:06:48.497
<i>What's</i> going on?

01:06:50.906 --> 01:06:53.431
- Nothing.
- Babe, do you hear this?

01:07:11.394 --> 01:07:14.158
- I <i>don't</i> believe this.
- What time is it?

01:07:20.669 --> 01:07:23.331
It's, like, 3:00 in the morning.

01:07:23.439 --> 01:07:25.907
- Where are you going?
- To tell them to shut up!

01:07:26.008 --> 01:07:28.704
No, you're not... Lisa, wait. Wait!

01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:30.073
No.

01:07:30.179 --> 01:07:32.409
- Wait! Wait, wait.
- No.

01:07:32.515 --> 01:07:34.779
- Look, please.
- Hey, let go of me.

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:36.511
I'll deal with it.

01:07:37.019 --> 01:07:38.714
Oh, this you wanna deal with, right?

01:07:38.821 --> 01:07:41.449
The macho bullshit. This you can handle.

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:42.990
<i>Don't</i> start.

01:07:50.599 --> 01:07:53.693
- Open the front door, man. Open it!
- I got it.

01:07:53.803 --> 01:07:54.792
Yeah?

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:57.168
Hey, can you ask Abel to come to the door?

01:07:57.273 --> 01:08:00.731
- <i>What's</i> the problem?
- Well, we're trying to sleep.

01:08:00.843 --> 01:08:03.573
We're trying to get hammered, asshole.

01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:20.692
- Hey, man!
- <i>What's</i> up?

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:27.162
Hey, there you guys are, man.
What happened to you?

01:08:29.904 --> 01:08:32.703
Hey! Who put you on the VIP list?

01:08:32.808 --> 01:08:33.774
Abel, what are you doing?

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:35.366
<i>It's</i> 3:00 in the morning,
we're trying to sleep.

01:08:35.478 --> 01:08:38.174
Come on, Chris. <i>I'm</i> glad you came over,
we can bury the hatchet.

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:39.269
<i>Let's</i> get you a drink.

01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:42.578
Fellows!
This is my next door neighbor, Chris.

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:46.484
As you can see, he is a Democrat.

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:49.654
Hey, we're not biased here.

01:08:49.758 --> 01:08:54.286
You can hug as many
and any tree you want. All right?

01:08:54.395 --> 01:08:55.886
Here you go.

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:04.834
Fellow <i>cop's</i> getting hitched.

01:09:04.939 --> 01:09:07.670
Condemned <i>man's</i> last meal,
you know the deal, right?

01:09:07.776 --> 01:09:08.834
Oh, hey, congratulations.

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:11.640
Now can you just turn
the goddamn music down?

01:09:11.747 --> 01:09:13.180
Is it disturbing you?

01:09:13.282 --> 01:09:15.273
Come on, <i>it's</i> practically
breaking the fricking windows.

01:09:15.384 --> 01:09:18.444
I bet you <i>can't</i> even
hear yourselves screw, huh?

01:09:20.221 --> 01:09:24.090
Chris here got himself a little dark
meat over there, you know?

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:26.221
You know, you need to be careful, neighbor.

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:29.194
You might not be enough man for her.

01:09:30.265 --> 01:09:32.166
Just busting your balls.

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:35.663
You know what they say,
<i>"Once you go black..."</i>

01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:38.331
- "You never go <i>back."</i>
- There you go!

01:09:38.941 --> 01:09:42.809
Besides, you <i>don't</i> wanna
piss these guys off, do you?

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.647
Look at that! <i>That's</i> something, <i>isn't</i> it?

01:09:45.747 --> 01:09:47.238
<i>I'm</i> massively aroused.

01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:49.943
Oh, see, there you go.
You're doing that Berkeley thing again.

01:09:50.051 --> 01:09:52.542
You're saying one thing,
but you mean another.

01:09:52.654 --> 01:09:54.748
<i>That's</i> irony, right?

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:56.119
I <i>don't</i> know. I <i>don't</i> know.

01:09:56.225 --> 01:09:59.490
You <i>don't</i> know?
If you went to Stanford <i>you'd</i> know.

01:10:00.496 --> 01:10:02.088
Oh, come on, man, lighten up.

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:05.099
Look, look.
As soon as we get through with the groom,

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:07.669
we'll turn the music down, you go home,
you get some sleep, all right?

01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:09.499
Bring him in here, yeah!

01:10:10.673 --> 01:10:12.664
Bring him in here, guys!

01:10:16.679 --> 01:10:20.137
- Put it on him, put it on him, put it on him!
- Show these cops.

01:10:20.816 --> 01:10:22.010
Come on, now!

01:10:22.117 --> 01:10:24.950
Hit him in the face with them!
Beat him in the face with those things!

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:26.578
Come on, now!

01:10:27.256 --> 01:10:28.416
Kim!

01:10:30.092 --> 01:10:32.253
Come on, now, give it up!

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:40.835
- Thank you.
- Oh, shut up. Come with me.

01:10:42.771 --> 01:10:45.069
- Are you bad?
- Take it down!

01:10:45.174 --> 01:10:46.471
Now, look...

01:10:50.346 --> 01:10:52.143
<i>Don't</i> let him get away! No, no!

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:53.647
Now we talking! Now we talking!

01:10:53.749 --> 01:10:54.807
Get off me!

01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:58.216
Grind it on him, baby. Put it on him!
Put it on him!

01:11:06.061 --> 01:11:08.256
Be careful now, <i>he's</i> a married man!

01:11:08.364 --> 01:11:10.423
He <i>doesn't</i> look so married to me.

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:15.669
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Let him up, let him up! Let him up!

01:11:19.608 --> 01:11:23.977
Nice pair, huh, Chris?
Little bit better than Lisa's, though, right?

01:11:24.913 --> 01:11:27.575
You do not wanna do that. Believe me.

01:11:27.683 --> 01:11:29.241
- Get him out of here.
- Get off me.

01:11:29.351 --> 01:11:32.115
<i>It's</i> a grown <i>man's</i>
playground over here, Chris.

01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:33.415
Tell the wife good night!

01:11:33.522 --> 01:11:35.490
Oh, shit! Bring those strippers back here.

01:11:35.591 --> 01:11:36.785
Come on, <i>don't</i> let her stop!

01:11:36.892 --> 01:11:41.295
No, <i>now's</i> the time. Put them titties out.
Break those titties out on him, baby!

01:11:42.164 --> 01:11:44.462
Yeah, right there! Right there.

01:11:47.169 --> 01:11:48.227
Hey.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:52.930
Babe, what are you doing?

01:11:53.042 --> 01:11:54.669
<i>Where's</i> my goddamn camcorder?

01:11:54.777 --> 01:11:55.869
Why?

01:11:57.646 --> 01:12:02.743
I've gotta record everything
that bastard does.

01:12:02.851 --> 01:12:03.977
Chris.

01:12:04.086 --> 01:12:05.576
<i>I'm</i> gonna take away his job...

01:12:05.688 --> 01:12:06.916
Honey.

01:12:07.523 --> 01:12:08.581
Pension...

01:12:09.358 --> 01:12:12.452
- His house...
- Honey, what happened over there?

01:12:13.462 --> 01:12:15.430
God. You <i>didn't</i> forget.

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:18.459
- What?
- You <i>didn't</i> forget!

01:12:19.201 --> 01:12:20.793
- You stopped taking them!
- What are you talking about?

01:12:20.903 --> 01:12:22.700
Your pills! What, you had to trick me?

01:12:22.805 --> 01:12:25.239
<i>That's</i> the kind of marriage you want? Fine!

01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:29.004
I <i>didn't</i> stop taking them,
I just missed a few days, and then I...

01:12:29.111 --> 01:12:30.203
I <i>didn't</i> do it on purpose!

01:12:30.312 --> 01:12:33.543
Oh, really?
<i>'Cause I find that hard to believe!</i>

01:12:35.818 --> 01:12:38.412
- I <i>don't</i> even know who you are.
- <i>I'm</i> your wife.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:42.388
Are you?
<i>'Cause I don't</i> even recognize you anymore!

01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:49.831
Where is that damn thing?

01:12:56.438 --> 01:12:59.771
<i>A number of wildfires</i>
<i>are raging out of control</i>

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:02.343
<i>and have so far burned 2500 acres</i>

01:13:02.444 --> 01:13:07.541
<i>and destroyed 185 homes</i>
<i>and businesses all around the Southland.</i>

01:13:07.649 --> 01:13:10.174
<i>The governor has declared</i>
<i>a state of emergency</i>

01:13:10.285 --> 01:13:12.685
<i>in six counties in Southern California.</i>

01:13:12.788 --> 01:13:16.121
<i>Forty thousand people have been</i>
<i>evacuated in the declared areas.</i>

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:17.590
<i>Everything is just so hard.</i>

01:13:17.693 --> 01:13:20.821
<i>I mean, no one want to lose any houses,</i>
<i>much less their own.</i>

01:13:20.929 --> 01:13:25.298
<i>Right now two additional fire teams</i>
<i>are gearing up to hit the lines tonight.</i>

01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:28.564
<i>We are joined right now</i>
<i>by Metro fire chief Greg Malio.</i>

01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:32.367
<i>- Greg, thanks for being with us.</i>
<i>- You're welcome, Pamela.</i>

01:14:22.724 --> 01:14:24.851
<i>Be careful now, he's a married man!</i>

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:27.360
<i>He doesn't look so married to me.</i>

01:14:28.797 --> 01:14:32.927
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey!</i>
<i>Let him up, let him up! Let him up!</i>

01:15:04.867 --> 01:15:08.462
<i>That's</i> great, guys.
Just put them all along the wall.

01:15:09.438 --> 01:15:11.372
Why are we doing this?

01:15:12.641 --> 01:15:14.973
<i>It's</i> good for the environment.

01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:19.674
Trees make oxygen.

01:15:36.999 --> 01:15:39.729
Well, you certainly <i>don't</i> look pregnant.

01:15:43.939 --> 01:15:46.032
That must make you happy.

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:50.509
<i>What's</i> going on, Lis?

01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:53.806
<i>I'm</i> sorry.

01:15:55.751 --> 01:15:57.514
I just <i>can't</i> stand this.

01:15:57.619 --> 01:16:01.555
I hate my job. <i>I'm</i> not even getting paid.

01:16:01.657 --> 01:16:03.955
- Then quit.
- And do what?

01:16:06.028 --> 01:16:08.690
I hate this neighborhood. I miss my family.

01:16:08.797 --> 01:16:11.265
Look, we knew it was gonna be hard.

01:16:11.366 --> 01:16:13.857
Maybe not this hard.
But we agreed that we'd...

01:16:13.969 --> 01:16:17.200
No, I agreed to do whatever you wanted

01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:20.207
because I thought that we were
moving toward something.

01:16:20.309 --> 01:16:21.298
We are.

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:25.005
<i>It's</i> your idea about what all this
is supposed to look like.

01:16:25.113 --> 01:16:29.516
- We just need to get used to this.
- <i>"We"</i> are now all three of us.

01:16:33.455 --> 01:16:36.515
I really need you to start thinking that way.

01:16:44.366 --> 01:16:47.233
I'll do whatever it takes to make you happy.

01:16:47.569 --> 01:16:50.129
That is all I have ever wanted.

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:58.345
Hey. Hey!

01:16:59.314 --> 01:17:00.747
Hey!

01:17:00.849 --> 01:17:04.945
Hey! What are you...
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

01:17:05.654 --> 01:17:08.248
- What? I <i>can't</i> hear you!
- Turn that goddamn thing off!

01:17:08.357 --> 01:17:10.917
- Abel, <i>what's</i> wrong with you?
- Turn it off and put it down!

01:17:11.026 --> 01:17:13.654
Now, you <i>didn't</i> ask my permission
to plant these trees.

01:17:13.762 --> 01:17:15.320
But they're hanging over on my property,

01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:17.921
so I <i>don't</i> need your permission
to cut them down.

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:19.466
Oh, come on!

01:17:19.568 --> 01:17:21.365
Turn that goddamn thing off!

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:23.438
You wanna shut
that mouthy bitch of yours up?

01:17:23.538 --> 01:17:25.005
She can say whatever she wants, asshole.

01:17:25.107 --> 01:17:27.701
Or what? You wanna come over here
and get busy, Chris? Come on!

01:17:27.809 --> 01:17:29.470
Come on over. <i>Let's</i> do something.

01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:31.170
Abel, come on, turn it off!

01:17:31.279 --> 01:17:32.769
Shut it off, my ass.

01:17:32.881 --> 01:17:34.109
What is wrong with you?

01:17:34.216 --> 01:17:36.980
Come on over.
Oh, you want her to be the man now?

01:17:37.085 --> 01:17:39.815
- Shut up!
- Come on. Bring it on over here. Come on.

01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:41.912
Come on, player, come on! Come on!
Come on, then.

01:17:42.024 --> 01:17:44.925
- <i>That's</i> what you want? Think you're bad?
- Yeah, yeah! Yeah, <i>that's</i> right, <i>I'm</i> bad!

01:17:45.027 --> 01:17:47.427
Yeah, put your little saw down!
What do you got now, buddy?

01:17:47.529 --> 01:17:50.987
Stop it. Honey. Honey! Honey! Hey! Stop it!

01:17:51.867 --> 01:17:53.232
Stop it!

01:17:53.335 --> 01:17:55.769
You like that, huh? Lisa, back up!

01:17:55.871 --> 01:17:58.135
- Have you lost your mind, Chris?
- Lisa, get off.

01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:59.867
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Get off of me!

01:17:59.975 --> 01:18:01.067
Come on!

01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:04.304
Chris, stop it! Have you lost your mind?

01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:06.574
Real tough now, huh?

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:08.980
Oh, shut up. Put the saw down and <i>let's</i> see.
<i>Let's</i> go! Come on!

01:18:09.084 --> 01:18:11.279
Come on over here. Come on!

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.947
There you go.

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:19.991
Run on in the house. Pussy. Sugar britches.

01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:21.892
- Prick.
- <i>That's</i> right!

01:18:22.764 --> 01:18:26.860
Plant something else over there,
see if I <i>don't</i> cut that down, too!

01:18:36.745 --> 01:18:36.778
<i>The flames are advancing quickly</i>
<i>in the hills surrounding</i>

01:18:36.778 --> 01:18:39.303
<i>The flames are advancing quickly</i>
<i>in the hills surrounding</i>

01:18:39.414 --> 01:18:41.575
<i>four counties in Southern California.</i>

01:18:41.683 --> 01:18:43.150
<i>In a moment, we're gonna talk about</i>

01:18:43.251 --> 01:18:45.742
<i>the drought conditions</i>
<i>across much of the country.</i>

01:18:45.854 --> 01:18:47.719
<i>But first, we're gonna go</i>
<i>to where they're paying</i>

01:18:47.823 --> 01:18:50.553
<i>a big price for tinderbox conditions.</i>

01:18:51.626 --> 01:18:53.389
Hot enough for you?

01:18:53.495 --> 01:18:55.622
I could use another 50 degrees.

01:18:55.731 --> 01:18:57.892
- Anything else?
- No, <i>I'm</i> good. Thanks.

01:18:57.999 --> 01:19:01.093
- Well, welcome to the neighborhood.
- Thank you.

01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:06.807
<i>People here are describing</i>
<i>the harrowing scene</i>

01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:08.273
<i>as they grabbed whatever they could</i>

01:19:08.376 --> 01:19:11.834
<i>of their precious possessions</i>
<i>and fled for their lives.</i>

01:19:11.947 --> 01:19:14.006
<i>As the fires roared out of control,</i>

01:19:14.116 --> 01:19:17.517
<i>fanned by 65-mile-per-hour</i>
<i>Santa Ana winds...</i>

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:22.284
Damn. I was trying to get away from you.

01:19:26.027 --> 01:19:27.426
Hey, hey, hey, hey. <i>It's</i> okay.

01:19:27.529 --> 01:19:30.191
<i>She's</i> got a big old 12-gauge back there.
<i>Nothing's</i> gonna jump off.

01:19:30.298 --> 01:19:31.856
Nope. Had my drink.

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:35.232
<i>There's</i> no need in you rushing home.
<i>Lisa's</i> not back yet.

01:19:35.337 --> 01:19:37.271
That kind of woman,
you gotta let her cool off for a while.

01:19:37.372 --> 01:19:40.864
Abel, Abel. Abel.
I <i>don't</i> care what you have to say.

01:19:40.976 --> 01:19:43.274
I <i>don't</i> care what you think.

01:19:43.378 --> 01:19:47.610
Just save it, all right?
All your poisonous race crap.

01:19:48.817 --> 01:19:50.614
Okay. You know what?

01:19:52.387 --> 01:19:56.346
<i>Wasn't</i> a good day for me.
Shit got a little out of hand. My bad.

01:19:58.393 --> 01:20:00.020
Sweetheart, bring me my regular

01:20:00.128 --> 01:20:02.221
and give him another
whatever it was he was having on me.

01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:04.127
Okay? All right?

01:20:13.542 --> 01:20:15.942
- There you go, darling.
- Thank you, baby.

01:20:16.044 --> 01:20:17.011
Here you go.

01:20:17.112 --> 01:20:20.138
Look at that shit. Headed right for us, huh?

01:20:24.886 --> 01:20:26.786
You know what today is?

01:20:28.156 --> 01:20:30.090
No, how would you know?

01:20:34.029 --> 01:20:37.396
<i>Today's</i> the third anniversary
of my <i>wife's</i> death.

01:20:42.737 --> 01:20:47.765
When Marcus went back to school,
she became a home-care aide.

01:20:48.243 --> 01:20:49.835
Mostly old people.

01:20:50.345 --> 01:20:53.405
<i>Alzheimer's</i> patients, stroke victims.

01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:57.748
I <i>don't</i> know how in the hell she did it,

01:20:59.254 --> 01:21:03.418
but it made me kind of glad that
<i>that's</i> what she did, you know?

01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:07.986
Sort of, you know, balanced things out,
you know?

01:21:09.231 --> 01:21:10.255
<i>How's</i> that?

01:21:10.365 --> 01:21:13.596
Well, you know,
because of what I do on my job.

01:21:20.508 --> 01:21:22.669
Three years ago to the day,

01:21:23.678 --> 01:21:25.202
I get a phone call.

01:21:26.214 --> 01:21:28.648
My <i>wife's</i> been in a head-on collision.

01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:31.878
Some guy high off his ass,

01:21:31.987 --> 01:21:35.787
going 90 miles an hour
the wrong way on the 101 just...

01:21:41.696 --> 01:21:44.563
They took her to Hollywood Memorial.

01:21:44.666 --> 01:21:46.930
She died on a gurney in the hall

01:21:47.035 --> 01:21:52.473
because somebody forgot to tell them
she was the wife of a police officer,

01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:55.134
so they treated her by pigmentation.

01:21:57.012 --> 01:22:00.072
- How do you know that?
- Because I know things.

01:22:02.951 --> 01:22:04.578
Well, <i>I'm</i> sorry.

01:22:07.055 --> 01:22:08.488
Thing is,

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:15.491
what I been trying to figure out
for three years to this day

01:22:16.064 --> 01:22:18.999
is why she was with her employer,

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:22.900
who took a steering column
through the chest, by the way.

01:22:23.004 --> 01:22:26.405
Where were they going
or coming from, Chris?

01:22:27.275 --> 01:22:29.835
My wife and her white boss?

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:32.937
In the middle of the afternoon on the 101

01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:37.644
when she should have been changing
some old <i>Jew's</i> Depends down on Fairfax.

01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:41.514
That really what
you wanna think about today?

01:22:41.623 --> 01:22:44.683
- <i>Wouldn't</i> you?
- No, I wouldn't.

01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:48.695
And why you telling me this?
What does this have to do with me?

01:22:49.197 --> 01:22:50.323
Nothing.

01:22:50.432 --> 01:22:52.957
Except you and your little chocolate drop

01:22:53.068 --> 01:22:56.526
picked the wrong time to move
and the wrong place.

01:23:00.408 --> 01:23:01.602
Whatever, Abel.

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:05.305
See, there you go.
You white boys always say <i>that.</i> "Whatever."

01:23:05.413 --> 01:23:09.474
And then you go ahead
and just do your shit anyway.

01:23:09.584 --> 01:23:11.814
<i>What's</i> that supposed to mean?

01:23:12.387 --> 01:23:16.949
That you think you can take
whatever you want.

01:23:17.759 --> 01:23:21.195
And I hate that. I hate it!
<i>That's</i> what it means!

01:23:25.633 --> 01:23:26.998
Hey, sorry, sweetheart.

01:23:27.102 --> 01:23:30.367
We just having a heart-to-heart here.
Right, Chris?

01:23:34.109 --> 01:23:35.906
You know what, Abel?

01:23:36.711 --> 01:23:38.042
Fuck you.

01:23:38.813 --> 01:23:41.407
Is that a "we are the <i>world"</i> fuck you?

01:23:41.983 --> 01:23:45.214
No. <i>It's</i> a special one, just for you.

01:23:46.621 --> 01:23:48.179
You've earned it.

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:51.450
We're not moving.

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:53.759
<i>"Whatever."</i>

01:24:25.994 --> 01:24:28.155
They said <i>it's</i> under control.

01:24:30.632 --> 01:24:33.226
Yeah, well, <i>let's</i> get this over with.

01:24:34.936 --> 01:24:37.131
- Then what?
- I <i>don't</i> know.

01:25:00.795 --> 01:25:03.320
We feel safe with Abel across the street

01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:05.991
because there are very bad people out there.

01:25:06.101 --> 01:25:08.092
People who steal and shoot you.

01:25:08.203 --> 01:25:10.933
But we have a black policeman living here.

01:25:11.039 --> 01:25:14.167
- Yes, <i>it's</i> very comforting.
- Annabelle, you leaving?

01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:16.971
Hey, hey, hey. <i>Abel's</i> famous cornbread.

01:25:18.079 --> 01:25:19.376
<i>Where's</i> Celia and Marcus?

01:25:19.481 --> 01:25:21.711
<i>It's</i> their week to spend
with my sister-in-law.

01:25:21.816 --> 01:25:24.011
Hi, Lisa. How are you?

01:25:25.086 --> 01:25:29.045
They're probably out there sharing tales
about what a hard-ass their dad is.

01:25:29.157 --> 01:25:31.887
They're gonna be grateful
for the rules one day.

01:25:31.993 --> 01:25:36.020
Yeah, I keep telling them that,
but I <i>don't</i> think they believe me.

01:25:58.286 --> 01:25:59.412
Fellows.

01:25:59.521 --> 01:26:03.013
Hey, <i>what's</i> the word, Abel?
Are we gonna be okay down here?

01:26:03.124 --> 01:26:05.854
Yeah. You know,
they'll stop it at the firebreak.

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.087
Never get through the pass.

01:26:08.730 --> 01:26:10.527
Chris, how you doing?

01:26:10.965 --> 01:26:12.330
Good.

01:26:12.433 --> 01:26:14.993
Got his game face on. <i>Who's</i> winning?

01:26:15.103 --> 01:26:16.695
Johnny and Chris right now.

01:26:16.804 --> 01:26:18.965
All right, well, I got next.

01:26:19.474 --> 01:26:20.532
Great.

01:26:40.728 --> 01:26:42.753
Hope this is not Division.

01:26:44.132 --> 01:26:45.759
- Turner here.
<i>- It's Darlington.</i>

01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:48.062
- Yeah.
<i>- I'm in the crib, homey.</i>

01:26:50.305 --> 01:26:51.829
Nice shot.

01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:53.908
All right, do your thing.

01:26:55.843 --> 01:26:57.208
Nice shot.

01:27:10.091 --> 01:27:12.423
<i>Ain't</i> nobody bitch, you prick!

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:22.135
Babe, <i>I'm</i> just really... I think I should go.

01:27:22.237 --> 01:27:24.728
You sure? You want me to go?

01:27:24.839 --> 01:27:26.238
No, <i>it's</i> fine.

01:27:26.674 --> 01:27:29.541
You accepted the invite, you should stay.

01:27:29.644 --> 01:27:31.043
All right.

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:34.708
- I'll be home in a bit.
- All right.

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:00.998
Come on. Pick up.

01:28:12.253 --> 01:28:15.188
- <i>What's</i> up?
- Get out of the house now.

01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:16.917
<i>The wife is on the way home.</i>

01:28:17.025 --> 01:28:18.014
You said they were away.

01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:20.822
Bail your big ass out of there right now.

01:28:24.966 --> 01:28:26.058
Shit.

01:28:58.566 --> 01:28:59.897
Chris?

01:29:02.503 --> 01:29:03.834
Be nice.

01:29:03.938 --> 01:29:05.803
- Calm down.
- Jesus.

01:29:07.709 --> 01:29:09.438
No! Stop!

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:14.708
What is that? Is that mine?

01:29:14.816 --> 01:29:17.148
I'll check on it. Wait. Wait.

01:29:24.492 --> 01:29:26.153
That is mine.

01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:27.557
Calm down.

01:29:29.163 --> 01:29:30.892
Just hold still!

01:29:33.234 --> 01:29:34.394
No! No!

01:29:34.502 --> 01:29:36.561
Will you just calm down?

01:29:40.108 --> 01:29:42.008
- Chris. Wait!
- Shit!

01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:43.543
- Chris!
- What?

01:29:43.644 --> 01:29:45.805
- Stay there!
- <i>It's</i> my wife!

01:29:51.352 --> 01:29:52.580
Lisa?

01:29:53.654 --> 01:29:54.780
Lisa?

01:29:55.490 --> 01:29:56.957
Yo, playa!

01:29:57.458 --> 01:29:58.720
<i>What's</i> up, man?

01:29:59.394 --> 01:30:01.259
What the hell, dude? Come on.

01:30:01.362 --> 01:30:03.353
Hey, what are you...

01:30:16.077 --> 01:30:17.101
Lisa?

01:30:17.478 --> 01:30:18.638
Lisa?

01:30:21.549 --> 01:30:23.039
God damn it.

01:30:23.718 --> 01:30:25.982
Oh, shit. No, no, no, no. Baby.

01:30:26.087 --> 01:30:27.486
<i>Don't</i> touch her.

01:30:27.588 --> 01:30:29.715
This is Officer Abel Turner
with the Valley Bureau.

01:30:29.824 --> 01:30:33.123
I need a black and white and an
ambulance at 1100 Lakeview Circle.

01:30:33.227 --> 01:30:35.422
10-53, possible head trauma.

01:30:35.997 --> 01:30:37.726
- <i>Don't</i> move her!
- Look, <i>I'm</i> trying to see if <i>she's</i> alive!

01:30:37.832 --> 01:30:41.461
Just talk to her.
Keep her calm till the paramedics come.

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:47.237
Oh, Jesus.

01:30:47.341 --> 01:30:50.799
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God, you're okay.

01:30:51.479 --> 01:30:55.006
You're okay. You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:58.678
Come on.
Shit, <i>where's</i> your goddamn phone?

01:30:58.786 --> 01:31:01.254
- Abel.
- Jesus Christ!

01:31:05.693 --> 01:31:08.526
<i>Everything's</i> under control.
The ambulance is on its way.

01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:10.494
- You all right?
- Fine.

01:31:17.305 --> 01:31:17.371
<i>Dr. Cohen, 6931. Dr. Cohen, 6931.</i>

01:31:17.371 --> 01:31:22.331
<i>Dr. Cohen, 6931. Dr. Cohen, 6931.</i>

01:31:25.012 --> 01:31:27.503
Mr. Mattson? The doctor will see you now.

01:31:27.615 --> 01:31:29.207
Okay, thanks.

01:31:40.094 --> 01:31:41.322
Hey.

01:31:43.464 --> 01:31:44.988
How you doing?

01:31:45.733 --> 01:31:48.600
About three degrees south of awful.

01:31:49.937 --> 01:31:52.337
I <i>don't</i> even know what that means.

01:31:53.875 --> 01:31:57.333
So they checked you out and you're okay.
<i>Baby's</i> okay.

01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:03.778
Honey, that guy...

01:32:05.019 --> 01:32:07.510
What happened? Did they catch him?

01:32:11.459 --> 01:32:13.450
Abel took care of him.

01:32:13.561 --> 01:32:14.721
Abel?

01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:17.589
- Shot him.
- In our house?

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.491
What was Abel doing in our house?

01:32:24.839 --> 01:32:27.103
We heard the alarm. Ran over.

01:32:29.143 --> 01:32:30.371
Right.

01:32:34.448 --> 01:32:37.315
- Hey, you need to rest, okay?
- Yeah.

01:32:37.418 --> 01:32:41.855
They're just gonna do a few more tests
and we'll get out of here soon.

01:33:02.843 --> 01:33:03.867
Yeah, Turner here.

01:33:03.978 --> 01:33:05.809
<i>Hey, my man. How's it going?</i>

01:33:05.913 --> 01:33:07.778
Detective. How goes it with you?

01:33:07.882 --> 01:33:09.144
Hey, man, I just wanted you to know,

01:33:09.250 --> 01:33:11.718
I told them you never
laid a finger on that guy.

01:33:11.819 --> 01:33:13.309
Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.

01:33:13.421 --> 01:33:15.389
So when you coming back?

01:33:16.090 --> 01:33:17.648
You know, <i>it's</i> hard to say. I <i>don't</i> know.

01:33:17.758 --> 01:33:18.918
Baby.

01:33:20.094 --> 01:33:22.460
Yeah, well, we still got
some fine times ahead of us, man.

01:33:22.563 --> 01:33:25.327
<i>I'm not taking that test for,</i>
<i>like, probably a year, or whatever.</i>

01:33:25.433 --> 01:33:26.730
<i>That's</i> great.

01:33:26.834 --> 01:33:30.361
Anyway, I just thought <i>I'd</i> call
and check up on you, man.

01:33:30.471 --> 01:33:31.802
I saw your neighborhood on the news

01:33:31.906 --> 01:33:35.364
and you pour that whole reservoir
on it if you have to, okay?

01:33:35.476 --> 01:33:37.501
You know I will. Thanks for calling.

01:33:37.612 --> 01:33:38.772
<i>All right.</i>

01:33:38.879 --> 01:33:39.971
Bye.

01:33:43.317 --> 01:33:44.284
Hey.

01:33:58.599 --> 01:34:02.330
Go on through. Right on through.
Keep going.

01:34:09.610 --> 01:34:12.636
- <i>He's</i> right. They've been notified!
- <i>It's</i> closed off.

01:34:12.747 --> 01:34:14.305
Hey. Can we go up?

01:34:14.415 --> 01:34:16.315
Only fire crew and homeowners, sir.

01:34:16.417 --> 01:34:18.476
We live on Lakeview Circle.

01:34:18.986 --> 01:34:20.385
Hold on.

01:34:23.557 --> 01:34:24.956
<i>That's</i> us. <i>That's</i> our address.

01:34:25.059 --> 01:34:27.721
I strongly suggest you pack
what you can quickly and evacuate.

01:34:27.828 --> 01:34:29.455
Nobody knows where
this <i>thing's</i> headed right now.

01:34:29.563 --> 01:34:31.656
- Okay. Thanks.
- Thank you.

01:34:31.766 --> 01:34:34.064
All right, clear a lane here!

01:34:40.374 --> 01:34:42.672
No problem. Let them through.

01:34:49.316 --> 01:34:50.374
Hey.

01:34:51.152 --> 01:34:54.087
You better think about getting out of here.

01:34:54.188 --> 01:34:55.815
I'll tough it out.

01:35:51.645 --> 01:35:54.341
<i>Yo, what's up? This is Clarence. Leave it.</i>

01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:04.715
Oh, God.

01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:18.430
This is unbelievable.

01:37:19.166 --> 01:37:20.599
Oh, my God.

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:27.907
Honey, we should start packing.

01:37:28.008 --> 01:37:31.102
I know. I know, I know, I know.
<i>Let's</i> get going.

01:37:34.114 --> 01:37:37.083
You know what?
Go on inside, <i>I'm</i> gonna go talk to Abel.

01:37:37.184 --> 01:37:39.846
- Baby...
- No, I wanna thank him.

01:37:43.924 --> 01:37:45.084
Right.

01:37:51.966 --> 01:37:53.228
Abel.

01:37:53.734 --> 01:37:54.996
Hey, <i>how's</i> your wife?

01:37:55.102 --> 01:37:57.627
<i>She's</i> okay. Thanks to you.

01:38:00.074 --> 01:38:03.066
Look, that guy who broke in,

01:38:06.213 --> 01:38:08.078
he deserved what he got.

01:38:09.483 --> 01:38:11.508
And I'll tell anyone that.

01:38:17.358 --> 01:38:20.088
You know, you better get on this
or get on back down the hill.

01:38:20.194 --> 01:38:23.254
Yeah, we're just gonna
grab some things and...

01:38:24.798 --> 01:38:26.629
Just wanna say thanks.

01:38:38.345 --> 01:38:39.573
Okay.

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:42.410
Babe, what can I get from downstairs?

01:38:44.084 --> 01:38:45.984
Just the photo albums.

01:38:55.496 --> 01:38:58.158
Okay. I'll be right back up.

01:39:22.723 --> 01:39:23.917
<i>Turner.</i>

Chris?

01:40:09.837 --> 01:40:11.828
You got this all wrong.

01:40:12.639 --> 01:40:14.607
Yeah, <i>that's</i> the bad <i>guy's</i> phone.

01:40:14.708 --> 01:40:18.576
<i>He's</i> been calling me, threatening me,
saying <i>he's</i> gonna hurt Celia.

Came to your place by mistake.

01:40:21.515 --> 01:40:24.245
You said yourself I did the right thing.

01:40:25.019 --> 01:40:27.613
And you were good with that, right?

01:40:34.361 --> 01:40:35.328
Chris!

01:40:35.896 --> 01:40:37.295
Oh, God!

Stay down! Stay down!
<i>Don't</i> move, you son of a bitch!

01:40:46.573 --> 01:40:48.006
Stay down!

01:40:48.475 --> 01:40:52.275
Take the keys, take the car, take this phone,
go down the hill and get the police.

01:40:52.379 --> 01:40:54.370
- What do you mean?
- He lied about everything!

01:40:54.481 --> 01:40:56.574
He got the guy to break into the house!

01:40:56.683 --> 01:40:58.878
Just go, honey, go! Go!

01:40:58.986 --> 01:41:00.977
Okay, okay! Okay, okay.

Neither one of you!

01:42:12.826 --> 01:42:14.851
- Stay back!
- Give it up, Chris!

01:42:14.962 --> 01:42:16.554
Get away from us!

01:42:16.663 --> 01:42:19.063
- You made your stand!
- Chris!

01:42:19.166 --> 01:42:21.532
- Get back!
- Come on!

01:42:21.635 --> 01:42:22.863
Help me!

01:42:28.976 --> 01:42:31.274
Please, no, no, no, no!

01:42:35.482 --> 01:42:37.347
- Put down your weapon! Do it!
- Jesus Christ.

01:42:37.451 --> 01:42:39.544
- Put down your weapon!
- <i>He's</i> trying to kill us!

01:42:39.653 --> 01:42:42.986
I got it under control, fellows.
<i>It's</i> all right, okay?

01:42:43.857 --> 01:42:44.915
<i>He's</i> my neighbor.

01:42:45.025 --> 01:42:47.858
<i>He's</i> having a bad day, you know?
<i>He's</i> under a lot of stress.

01:42:47.961 --> 01:42:50.156
<i>He's</i> lying!
<i>Don't</i> listen to him, <i>he's</i> got a gun!

01:42:50.264 --> 01:42:53.700
- I do not have a weapon! Look!
- No, <i>he's</i> lying.

01:42:54.668 --> 01:42:58.035
His wife was attacked today.
I took the guy down.

01:42:58.138 --> 01:42:59.935
You can call in and check that out.
All right?

01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:01.507
Do not move any further!

01:43:01.608 --> 01:43:03.098
<i>He's</i> just a little demented.

01:43:03.210 --> 01:43:06.373
He went off and attacked me,
but <i>he's</i> okay. All right?

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:08.414
<i>He's</i> got a gun, <i>it's</i> right behind his back!

01:43:08.515 --> 01:43:11.279
Listen, <i>I'm</i> LAPD, guys!
<i>I'm</i> law enforcement like you!

01:43:11.385 --> 01:43:13.410
I <i>don't</i> give a damn
if you're the Pope, asshole!

01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:15.454
Do not move any further!

01:43:15.556 --> 01:43:16.716
<i>It's</i> true, <i>he's</i> a cop!

01:43:16.823 --> 01:43:18.916
See, Chris? <i>I'm</i> the police!

01:43:19.693 --> 01:43:24.096
You have to do what I say, okay?
Put down the gun, all right?

01:43:24.198 --> 01:43:25.324
Sir, put the weapon down!

01:43:25.432 --> 01:43:28.060
No, I will not! Not till he puts his down!

01:43:28.168 --> 01:43:29.465
- <i>He's</i> got a gun, God damn it!
- Chris, get down.

01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:30.696
I do not have a gun.

01:43:30.804 --> 01:43:32.169
Then turn around, Abel! Then turn around!

01:43:32.272 --> 01:43:33.933
Sir, drop the weapon!

01:43:34.041 --> 01:43:35.906
Please. Please get down.

01:43:36.009 --> 01:43:36.998
Come on!

01:43:37.110 --> 01:43:40.307
If you point that thing at me, Chris,
you better be willing to use it.

01:43:40.414 --> 01:43:42.439
- Stay where you are!
- This is what you want, huh, Abel?

01:43:42.549 --> 01:43:44.312
- Sir, drop it!
- This is what you want?

01:43:44.418 --> 01:43:45.885
Chris, listen to me! Stop it!

01:43:45.986 --> 01:43:48.216
Listen to your wife, asshole!

01:43:49.656 --> 01:43:51.123
Chris, please stop!

01:43:52.226 --> 01:43:53.454
Chris.

01:43:57.931 --> 01:44:00.866
- Did you listen to your wife?
- What?

01:44:00.968 --> 01:44:02.731
- Did you?
- Chris, stop!

01:44:02.836 --> 01:44:04.804
Maybe you should've listened to your wife.
Did you see it coming?

01:44:04.905 --> 01:44:07.305
- Shut up! You <i>don't</i> bring my wife into this!
- When she ran off on you?

01:44:07.407 --> 01:44:09.170
- You leave my wife out of this!
- Did you see it coming?

01:44:09.276 --> 01:44:12.177
- <i>Don't</i> let her name come out of your mouth!
- Did you see it coming, Abel?

01:44:12.279 --> 01:44:15.442
- <i>He's</i> got a gun! <i>He's</i> got a gun!
- Just shut up!

01:44:44.811 --> 01:44:47.302
Ma'am, can you come with me please?

01:44:48.849 --> 01:44:51.215
Just take your time. Here we go.

01:44:55.322 --> 01:44:57.984
<i>Let's</i> get you up in here to see someone.

01:44:59.526 --> 01:45:01.118
Watch your step.

01:45:07.367 --> 01:45:08.493
Hey.

01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:13.262
We're gonna move him to the hospital now.
We've stopped the bleeding.

01:45:13.373 --> 01:45:14.806
You should let me take a look at you, miss.

01:45:14.908 --> 01:45:16.432
No, <i>I'm</i> fine.

01:45:16.543 --> 01:45:18.238
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:45:25.419 --> 01:45:26.784
How are you?

01:45:30.090 --> 01:45:32.115
Three degrees south of...

01:45:42.502 --> 01:45:43.833
I love you.

01:45:45.772 --> 01:45:47.171
I know.

01:45:49.810 --> 01:45:51.402
I love you, too.

01:45:54.748 --> 01:45:56.579
The rest <i>isn't</i> important.

01:46:02.456 --> 01:46:04.390
We're gonna have a family.
