[siren blares]

01:27.755 --> 01:30.589
[Rupert exhales]

01:31.392 --> 01:33.258
- [Man] And action.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.833
- Jesus Christ,
that's a suicide vest.

01:43.104 --> 01:44.837
He's wearing enough
plastic explosives

01:44.839 --> 01:47.106
to vaporize the plane.

01:47.708 --> 01:48.574
Fuck.

01:49.477 --> 01:50.342
Fuck.

01:51.212 --> 01:51.877
Fuck.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.413
What do we do?

01:59.220 --> 02:00.220
Can I try that again?

02:00.221 --> 02:01.653
- No.

02:01.655 --> 02:02.721
That's okay.

02:04.258 --> 02:05.858
I've got what I need.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.294
Thanks for coming in.

02:12.133 --> 02:14.900
[melancholy music]

02:53.207 --> 02:55.607
[siren blares]

03:50.764 --> 03:54.566
- I'm Dr. Dale Rumsfield,
veterinary surgeon.

03:59.006 --> 04:02.574
I'm Dr. Dale Rumsfield,
veterinary surgeon.

04:03.944 --> 04:07.312
I'm a man who loves animals,
but I've seen so many die

04:07.314 --> 04:11.450
that my love has become
trapped deep in my chest.

04:18.459 --> 04:21.360
There's a broken
marriage behind me

04:21.362 --> 04:26.431
and a childhood wound that
haunts me in the small hours.

04:27.768 --> 04:31.303
But I won't permit such
distractions to enter my surgery.

04:31.305 --> 04:35.774
They remain outside the door,
lurking just beyond view,

04:39.480 --> 04:42.047
where such things always lurk.

04:46.053 --> 04:49.054
[melancholy music]

05:05.539 --> 05:08.640
- [Recording] You
have a new message.

05:08.642 --> 05:09.875
First message.

05:11.345 --> 05:13.578
- [Dolores] Rupert,
it's Dolores.

05:13.580 --> 05:14.846
You won't be surprised to hear

05:14.848 --> 05:18.684
you didn't get the part
in Death at 30,000 feet.

05:18.686 --> 05:21.053
Somehow, I'm managed
to get you an audition

05:21.055 --> 05:23.322
for another small
role this afternoon.

05:23.324 --> 05:26.325
They liked you in
the pizza commercial.

05:26.327 --> 05:28.527
I'm emailing you the script.

05:56.423 --> 05:58.824
- She left me, Patty.

05:58.826 --> 06:03.829
She packed her bags last
night and walked out the door.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.665
When the latch clicked
shut, my life ended.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.367
My love was gone.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.042
She left me, Patty.

06:17.044 --> 06:21.580
She packed her bags last
night and walked out the door.

06:34.395 --> 06:35.827
She left me, Patty.

06:37.131 --> 06:42.100
She packed her bags last
night and walked out the door.

06:43.604 --> 06:46.171
And when the latch clicked
shut, my life ended.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.041
My love was gone.

06:51.879 --> 06:54.679
[dramatic music]

07:21.475 --> 07:22.908
- That's your mark.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.511
Uh, lose the hat.

07:27.681 --> 07:28.613
- But it's part of
my character's--

07:28.615 --> 07:30.649
- Just lose the hat, buddy.

07:36.190 --> 07:39.090
And action.

07:43.564 --> 07:45.597
- She left me, Patty.

07:46.700 --> 07:51.503
She packed her bags last
night and walked out the door.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.540
And when the latch clicked
shut, my life ended!

07:56.677 --> 07:59.110
The fucking bitch was gone now!

08:03.584 --> 08:06.218
How was that for
you, cocksucker?

08:08.655 --> 08:10.989
- Uh, thanks for coming in.

08:55.736 --> 08:58.803
- [Recording] You
have a new message.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.288
- [Dolores] I've
had it with you.

09:00.289 --> 09:01.772
If they want sadness,
you give them rage.

09:01.775 --> 09:04.643
And if they want rage,
you give them eroticism?

09:04.645 --> 09:06.077
You haven't managed
a proper performance

09:06.079 --> 09:08.880
since you played a chef
in that pizza commercial,

09:08.882 --> 09:10.782
and that was 18 months ago.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.984
You are not commercially viable.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.053
Consider yourself fired.

09:30.804 --> 09:31.804
- I know.

09:38.645 --> 09:40.712
I've gotta do something.

09:47.621 --> 09:48.920
Angus McFadden.

10:11.979 --> 10:14.646
Dr. Dale Rumsfield recommends

10:14.648 --> 10:18.617
against strenuous activity
whilst convalescing.

10:24.091 --> 10:28.393
If you want to fly again,
you must avoid agitation.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.385
It dulls you, doesn't it,

10:54.821 --> 10:59.157
putting a lid on all
things, good and bad.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.661
[phone rings]

11:10.170 --> 11:13.071
- [Angus] Angus McFadden.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.073
- How are ya, Angus?

11:15.075 --> 11:17.242
I was wondering if
you could help me out.

11:17.244 --> 11:20.111
A pal of mine suffers
from bouts of amnesia

11:20.113 --> 11:22.947
which can last for
anything up to a few hours.

11:22.949 --> 11:27.452
The only problem is he often
misbehaves during those periods

11:27.454 --> 11:31.423
and then has absolutely no
memory at all of what he's done.

11:31.425 --> 11:33.958
He's getting it all arse ways,

11:33.960 --> 11:37.028
and I'm hoping you can help
put the poor fellow straight.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.296
- [Angus] Well,
sure, I can help.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.998
What's your friend's name?

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
- Rupert.

11:42.436 --> 11:45.236
- [Angus] Would you like to
make an appointment for him?

11:45.238 --> 11:46.871
When's a good time?

11:46.873 --> 11:49.107
- [mumbles] How
soon can you manage?

11:49.109 --> 11:51.076
- [Angus] Tomorrow
afternoon at three.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.377
- That soon?

11:52.379 --> 11:53.845
- [Angus] Too early?

11:53.847 --> 11:54.813
- No, no.

11:54.815 --> 11:57.148
No, tomorrow afternoon's grand.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.050
- [Angus] Rupert.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.118
- Yes?

12:01.488 --> 12:04.322
- Looking forward
to meeting you.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.201
Olga!

12:15.936 --> 12:17.502
[baby cries]

12:17.504 --> 12:21.339
Yeah, I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know.

12:22.809 --> 12:25.276
- Stand on the garbage truck.

12:26.146 --> 12:29.514
- Olga, I really have
to go to work now.

12:51.171 --> 12:55.273
So what sort of misbehavior
are we talking about?

12:58.512 --> 13:00.912
- It's hard to say really.

13:03.216 --> 13:06.317
- Because of the
bouts of amnesia?

13:10.257 --> 13:11.489
But if you can't remember,

13:11.491 --> 13:13.858
how do you know
there's a problem?

13:13.860 --> 13:15.994
- It's ruining my career.

13:18.565 --> 13:21.132
- Are you aware of
anything you've done

13:21.134 --> 13:22.934
during these moments?

13:28.975 --> 13:31.476
- Well, I know I
punch walls sometimes

13:31.478 --> 13:34.078
and break things in my flat.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.848
I see the damage afterwards

13:36.850 --> 13:40.318
and know no one
else has been there.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.388
- That must be
pretty scary for you.

13:49.095 --> 13:52.397
Are you aware you're
rubbing your lips?

13:57.037 --> 13:58.203
- So I'm rubbing my lips.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.370
So fucking what?

14:04.411 --> 14:07.212
- So I was wondering if
you're feeling anxious

14:07.214 --> 14:09.347
about having said too much.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.558
What happened there?

14:23.396 --> 14:27.165
- Lips, lips, lips.

14:31.872 --> 14:32.570
Lips.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.472
Lips.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.108
Lips.

15:03.503 --> 15:06.070
- [Angus] What happened there?

15:07.474 --> 15:09.574
- What happened where?

15:35.568 --> 15:37.468
[phone rings]

15:37.470 --> 15:39.270
- [Dolores] Dolores Joe.

15:39.272 --> 15:40.104
- Hi.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.039
Hi, Dolores.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.541
It's Rupert Lindsay here.

15:43.543 --> 15:46.077
Now listen, I got
your voicemail.

15:46.079 --> 15:49.614
And the thing is I
was actually mugged

15:49.616 --> 15:52.583
on the way to the audition.

15:52.585 --> 15:56.020
Yeah, two huge Russian men.

15:56.022 --> 15:57.722
It was, it was brutal.

15:59.025 --> 16:01.326
So not surprisingly, I
was a little distraught

16:01.328 --> 16:02.694
when I went to casting--

16:02.696 --> 16:04.696
- Oh, fuck off, Rupert!

16:23.516 --> 16:26.184
[phone buzzes]

16:44.671 --> 16:47.672
- [Recording] You
have a new message.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.107
First message.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.711
- [Dolores] I was just
about to delete your file,

16:53.713 --> 16:57.081
but for some strange reason,
Trudy at Britannia Casting

16:57.083 --> 16:59.550
has specifically asked to
see you for the title role

16:59.552 --> 17:03.321
of The Fatal Blasphemy of
Jeremiah Ulysses's Boundless Rage,

17:03.323 --> 17:06.357
a previously undiscovered
Christopher Marlowe play.

17:06.358 --> 17:09.327
It's about a puritan who's
always furiously angry,

17:09.329 --> 17:11.128
so right up your street.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.797
Duncan Barnes has
just pulled out,

17:12.799 --> 17:16.166
so looking for someone to go
straight into dress rehearsals.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.102
Whoever gets the part
will be co-starring

17:18.104 --> 17:22.272
with Tamsin Hollonby,
the queen of method.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.375
This is the chance
of a lifetime.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.243
Tamsin is huge.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.744
Fuck it up like
your last audition

17:27.747 --> 17:30.681
and you might just get the role.

17:31.551 --> 17:32.617
- Fuck it up?

17:32.619 --> 17:35.253
I'll fuck you up, you old bent!

17:41.161 --> 17:42.161
Fuck!

17:47.100 --> 17:49.267
[grunts]

17:50.770 --> 17:53.204
[screams]

17:55.842 --> 17:59.677
Thou scorns sweet
innocence and chastity.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.729
[knocking on wall]

18:01.730 --> 18:03.780
Thou art wholly wanton
and lascivious--

18:04.651 --> 18:06.651
- [Neighbor] Shut up.

18:06.653 --> 18:11.522
- I have to listen to thy
drum and bass at all hours,

18:11.524 --> 18:16.194
so thou can fucking well
listen to a bit of literature!

18:22.168 --> 18:26.871
Marriage is a sacrament
to our divine father

18:26.873 --> 18:30.708
and gives thee not
permission for wantonness!

18:30.710 --> 18:33.711
[melancholy music]

19:17.157 --> 19:20.858
- Marriage is a sacrament
to our divine father

19:21.928 --> 19:24.829
and gives thee not
permission for wantonness!

19:24.831 --> 19:27.215
Thou are corrupted.

19:27.216 --> 19:29.600
- I'm seeing anger
and I'm hearing anger,

19:30.403 --> 19:32.603
but I'm not feeling anger.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.540
There's nothing here to
hold a flickering candle

19:35.542 --> 19:37.808
to Tamsin's artistry.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.244
- Thanks for coming in, Jack.

19:40.246 --> 19:43.181
Uh, David Myers.

19:43.183 --> 19:44.749
- [Rupert] I was here first!

19:44.751 --> 19:46.217
- [Trudy] He's next on my list.

19:46.219 --> 19:47.852
- [Rupert] I don't give
a fuck about your list!

19:47.854 --> 19:49.420
First come, first served.

19:49.422 --> 19:50.755
- This isn't a restaurant.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.924
- Let's see what
he's got, Trudy.

19:52.926 --> 19:56.861
I'm Geoffrey Morton, director
of Queen of the Commons.

19:56.863 --> 20:00.631
- I'd keep quiet about
that if I were you.

20:04.971 --> 20:07.271
What do you want me to say?

20:08.374 --> 20:10.708
- Well, what do you
feel like saying?

20:10.710 --> 20:13.945
- You wouldn't wanna hear
what I feel like saying.

20:13.947 --> 20:15.980
- Well, actually, I would.

20:17.784 --> 20:18.984
Go for it.

20:20.620 --> 20:23.788
- I detest auditions.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.256
I fuckin' hate them!

20:25.258 --> 20:26.490
It's not the acting.

20:26.492 --> 20:27.992
That's not a problem,
no, no, no, no.

20:27.994 --> 20:31.829
What I can't stand
are all the pompous,

20:31.831 --> 20:35.433
arrogant, small-minded
cocksuckers

20:35.435 --> 20:39.337
who sit in their fat
asses and judge my art!

20:41.341 --> 20:44.976
Is that the sort of
thing you had in mind?

20:44.978 --> 20:47.612
- How long did it take
you to work up the rage?

20:47.614 --> 20:49.480
- About half a second.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.415
- And what did you
use to provoke it?

20:51.417 --> 20:52.450
- Your face.

20:54.821 --> 20:56.287
- Can you say a
line from the play?

20:56.289 --> 20:59.690
- Marriage is a sacrament
to our divine father

20:59.692 --> 21:03.027
and gives thee not
permission for wantonness.

21:03.029 --> 21:06.564
Thou are corrupted
by thy vain fancies.

21:06.566 --> 21:10.001
The God thy service
is thy own appetite.

21:10.003 --> 21:13.971
Thou scorns sweet
innocence and chastity.

21:13.973 --> 21:18.342
Thou art wholly
wanton and lascivious!

21:23.716 --> 21:26.534
What else do you want?

21:26.535 --> 21:29.353
- I think I'd want you to sign
a contract and come to lunch.

21:29.355 --> 21:31.922
We've got a lot to talk about.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.393
- Let's go to the office

21:35.395 --> 21:39.397
and check we've got all
your contact details.

21:41.367 --> 21:42.633
- [Oliver] Are you
sure about this?

21:42.635 --> 21:44.869
He seems slightly
unhinged to me.

21:44.871 --> 21:49.807
- It was authentic, Oliver,
still resonating in me.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.409
- Everything is riding on him--

21:51.411 --> 21:54.011
- We're gonna knock this
out of the ballpark.

21:54.013 --> 21:56.047
- Curtain goes up in 10 days.

21:56.049 --> 21:58.349
- He's got enough anger
to hit the ground running.

21:58.351 --> 22:00.351
I can feel it.

22:00.353 --> 22:02.620
Look, will you sort
out the contracts,

22:02.622 --> 22:06.457
talk to the press while
I take him to lunch?

22:06.459 --> 22:08.492
Thanks, Oliver.

22:08.494 --> 22:10.728
I appreciate your support.

22:21.374 --> 22:23.708
- What do you think?

22:23.710 --> 22:26.477
- Multiple personality disorder.

22:26.479 --> 22:27.545
- Seriously?

22:28.815 --> 22:29.680
- He's an actor.

22:29.682 --> 22:32.516
[animal screeches]

22:32.518 --> 22:33.918
[boar growls]

22:33.920 --> 22:36.921
[soft piano music]

22:40.026 --> 22:42.760
- So was it the Cambridge
[mumbles] on to the BBC?

22:42.762 --> 22:45.863
- Have you been reading my biog?

22:45.865 --> 22:48.499
- It's written all over you.

22:48.501 --> 22:50.701
- I spent six wonderful
years at the Beeb

22:50.703 --> 22:55.039
before leaving to direct
Queen of the Commons,

22:55.041 --> 22:58.376
which took $42
million at box office.

22:58.378 --> 22:59.577
I was only 28.

23:02.849 --> 23:03.849
- Prick.

23:05.485 --> 23:08.386
- And now, here we are
with The Fatal Blasphemy

23:08.388 --> 23:11.689
of Jeremiah Ulysses's
Boundless Rage.

23:11.691 --> 23:14.658
The dialogue was impenetrable.

23:14.660 --> 23:17.161
Some of the stage directions
are very confusing,

23:17.163 --> 23:19.997
but I think we've
knocked it into shape.

23:19.999 --> 23:22.533
- Does the BBC breed
that kind of arrogance,

23:22.535 --> 23:23.968
or was that there
from prep school?

23:23.970 --> 23:25.569
- Look, I studied
Marlowe at Trinity,

23:25.571 --> 23:28.439
and the fact is none of his
original scripts survived.

23:28.441 --> 23:30.474
Most of them were
copied down from memory.

23:30.476 --> 23:31.675
So who's...

23:35.148 --> 23:39.517
So who's to say what was
actually on the page.

23:39.519 --> 23:40.618
- You?

23:40.620 --> 23:46.924
- How many of us admit to
being really angry with God?

23:47.960 --> 23:49.560
That's what Marlowe
was exploring.

23:49.562 --> 23:54.465
To rage against God in 16th
England was great blasphemy.

23:54.467 --> 23:58.002
It may well be the reason
why he was murdered.

23:58.004 --> 24:00.571
In any case, it's
a hell of a part.

24:00.573 --> 24:02.873
Jeremiah Ulysses is the
method actor's dream.

24:02.875 --> 24:05.075
- I don't do method.

24:05.077 --> 24:07.978
- [Geoffrey] What would
you call your approach?

24:07.980 --> 24:08.980
- Anger.

24:11.717 --> 24:15.820
- So why have you and
Morton switched to theater?

24:15.822 --> 24:20.591
- Who could resist a lost
play by Christopher Marlowe?

24:21.527 --> 24:24.929
- Your last two films
sank without a trace.

24:26.566 --> 24:30.968
- Kit Marlowe was the
foremost tragedian of his age.

24:32.672 --> 24:36.607
Some say his death was faked
and that he is the main author

24:36.609 --> 24:38.642
of all the poems and the plays

24:38.644 --> 24:41.612
attributed to William
Shakespeare, who only came

24:41.614 --> 24:45.683
into preeminence after
Marlowe's supposed passing.

24:45.685 --> 24:50.521
- And Hollywood's treating
you like you have wet leprosy.

24:53.059 --> 24:57.127
- Shortly before his
recorded death, 1593,

24:57.129 --> 25:00.631
Marlowe is arrested in
connection with a manuscript

25:00.633 --> 25:04.068
he had written said to contain
vile heretical conceit.

25:04.070 --> 25:08.739
We are staging that manuscript
for the first time ever.

25:11.911 --> 25:14.578
- You're very good to Morton.

25:25.958 --> 25:29.026
- So did daddy fund
the tranny film?

25:29.028 --> 25:31.562
- My father's in hospital,

25:31.564 --> 25:33.831
so it's a bit of a sensitive
subject for me right now.

25:33.833 --> 25:36.634
- Did he get pissed
and fall over again?

25:36.636 --> 25:38.202
- He has stage four cancer.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.838
[Rupert burps]

25:42.642 --> 25:45.943
- So he fund the
fag film or not?

25:45.945 --> 25:47.678
- I'm not getting this.

25:47.680 --> 25:50.214
Is this unpleasantness
part of your preparation,

25:50.216 --> 25:53.183
or is this just how you are?

25:53.185 --> 25:55.719
- I'm just trying to
make conversation.

25:55.721 --> 25:58.289
- What, so you immerse
yourself in your rage,

25:58.291 --> 26:00.257
and your malice,
and your bitterness,

26:00.259 --> 26:01.759
and you don't mind
if other people--

26:01.761 --> 26:02.893
- We haven't talked money.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.128
I'm gonna need quite a lot

26:04.130 --> 26:06.864
to put up with this
kind of bullshit.

26:06.866 --> 26:09.733
- Look, I want you
to be as furious

26:09.735 --> 26:11.869
as you possibly can
be for the role.

26:11.871 --> 26:13.137
I really do.

26:13.139 --> 26:14.872
And I know that when
you go that deep,

26:14.874 --> 26:17.608
there's gonna be some spillover.

26:17.610 --> 26:19.810
But as your director,

26:19.812 --> 26:23.280
I'm gonna need a
little bit of respect.

26:23.282 --> 26:25.182
Is that okay with you?

26:26.218 --> 26:27.313
- How much?

26:29.855 --> 26:32.289
- I'm aware we're asking a lot.

26:32.291 --> 26:35.859
Duncan pulling out meant we
had to cancel our previews.

26:35.861 --> 26:38.596
That means you'll have to learn
the lines over the weekend

26:38.598 --> 26:39.997
and then go into a
week of dress rehearsal

26:39.999 --> 26:41.865
starting on Monday.

26:41.867 --> 26:45.636
You get the Sunday off,
and then the last rehearsal

26:45.638 --> 26:49.106
is on the Monday, with the
press performance that night.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.875
It's a tall order, which is why

26:51.877 --> 26:55.346
we're paying you 30,000
pounds for the rehearsals

26:55.348 --> 26:57.948
and the press night performance.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.184
Conditional on good reviews,

27:00.186 --> 27:03.153
we're guaranteed a speedy
transfer to the West End.

27:03.155 --> 27:08.225
And obviously, there'll be more
money for you at that point.

27:15.001 --> 27:17.968
[soft piano music]

28:10.322 --> 28:12.923
[dove coos]

28:17.963 --> 28:21.131
[melancholy music]

29:12.885 --> 29:13.951
- He's evil.

29:15.154 --> 29:17.154
- See, I didn't notice that.

29:17.156 --> 29:19.289
Angry, yes, but not evil.

29:20.860 --> 29:23.127
- [Rupert] He's a freak.

29:23.129 --> 29:24.129
- A freak?

29:28.234 --> 29:31.802
Have you ever been
called a freak, Rupert?

29:35.074 --> 29:36.240
- Fuck you!

29:37.109 --> 29:39.076
- Welcome back.

29:39.078 --> 29:41.178
That question a little
too close to the bone?

29:41.180 --> 29:44.081
Do you feel you need
to protect him from it?

29:44.083 --> 29:47.851
- You're just as fucked
up as everyone else.

29:47.853 --> 29:49.553
- You're mostly right.

29:53.192 --> 29:55.559
- So what's your story, Angus?

29:57.229 --> 29:59.029
- I'm not sure my story

29:59.030 --> 30:00.830
would get a fair
hearing at the moment.

30:00.833 --> 30:02.966
- [mumbles] Keep it secret.

30:02.968 --> 30:05.969
- Speaking of
secrets, what's yours?

30:05.971 --> 30:10.140
- The brilliant psychotherapist
turns the tables.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.342
In a moment of
blinding inspiration,

30:12.344 --> 30:14.411
he sees that what the
client has said about him

30:14.413 --> 30:16.547
must in fact be about,

30:16.549 --> 30:18.215
wait for it, folks,

30:18.217 --> 30:22.386
yes, it must in fact be
about the client himself.

30:30.196 --> 30:31.495
- Must be hard.

30:31.497 --> 30:35.199
- What, being a successful
psychotherapist?

30:35.201 --> 30:38.335
- Finding love when
nobody likes you.

30:40.239 --> 30:43.173
[melancholy music]

30:52.985 --> 30:55.953
- Just seen it in the papers,

30:55.955 --> 31:00.290
The Blasphemy of Ulysses
with Tamsin Hollonby no less.

31:04.563 --> 31:09.266
You've hit the big time,
just what you always wanted.

31:14.506 --> 31:15.639
- Hello, dad.

31:31.957 --> 31:34.024
- Any chance of a drink?

31:36.195 --> 31:37.094
- Tea?

31:38.397 --> 31:40.130
- Anything stronger?

31:41.000 --> 31:42.366
- [Rupert] Coffee?

31:45.304 --> 31:48.071
[dove coos]

31:48.073 --> 31:49.339
- [Dad] What's that?

31:49.341 --> 31:51.541
- You know what, now's
not really a good time.

31:51.543 --> 31:56.213
I need to study my script and
prepare myself for the role.

31:56.215 --> 31:59.316
- I should have
brought champagne,

31:59.318 --> 32:01.518
be the first to celebrate.

32:01.520 --> 32:02.653
Tell you what.

32:03.622 --> 32:06.390
When I get my giro,

32:07.393 --> 32:09.993
I'll buy a bottle,

32:09.995 --> 32:13.297
bring it down, raise a glass.

32:19.171 --> 32:20.604
Next week sometime.

32:26.111 --> 32:28.946
- Let me know when
you're coming.

32:47.733 --> 32:51.568
Dare thee speak of
morals, thou common hussy.

32:57.242 --> 33:01.678
Is thy persona entirely
barren of abashment?

33:11.490 --> 33:14.558
Whence stem these
shameless desires?

33:16.695 --> 33:20.697
Surely, thou art fallen
into the serpent's pit.

33:27.339 --> 33:30.340
How am I gonna do
this without him?

33:35.447 --> 33:37.581
Ideas, please?

33:51.296 --> 33:52.296
Fuck!

33:55.334 --> 33:56.566
Fucking table!

34:13.552 --> 34:14.751
- Drunkard!

34:24.496 --> 34:27.297
Harlot! [winces]

34:31.770 --> 34:32.864
Wanton whore!

34:48.520 --> 34:51.621
[phone buzzes]

34:51.623 --> 34:52.789
- What?

34:52.791 --> 34:54.224
- [Driver] Good
morning, Mr. Lindsay.

34:54.226 --> 34:55.458
This is your car service.

34:55.460 --> 34:59.296
I'm waiting outside to
take you to the theater.

35:07.739 --> 35:09.372
- [Stevie.] Tamsin.

35:09.374 --> 35:10.207
- Tamsin?

35:10.209 --> 35:12.209
No, I'm Meghan Ulysses.

35:13.278 --> 35:14.311
- Pleased to meet you, Meghan.

35:14.313 --> 35:15.413
I'm Stevie.

35:16.782 --> 35:17.881
Okay.

35:20.752 --> 35:21.952
Is it sore?

35:23.322 --> 35:24.254
- Don't worry about that.

35:24.256 --> 35:26.456
Just glue the scars on top.

35:27.626 --> 35:28.758
Make me suffer.

35:36.869 --> 35:37.767
- Sorry.

36:08.767 --> 36:09.666
- Oh.

36:10.802 --> 36:13.904
[chuckles] I'm sorry to
put you through makeup

36:13.906 --> 36:18.208
for rehearsals, but I
think it's important.

36:18.210 --> 36:20.243
- You behold them as
the scarred tracks

36:20.245 --> 36:22.879
of my husband's oft used
whip, but I beseech you

36:22.881 --> 36:27.184
to look again for truly,
they are open wounds.

36:28.353 --> 36:29.419
- Brilliant.

36:30.889 --> 36:32.189
I love it.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.918
Ah, I thought
you'd gone missing.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.788
Your driver couldn't
track you down.

37:04.790 --> 37:07.324
- Much better chance and
faith in public transport.

37:07.326 --> 37:10.393
- Now, as I told you,
everything is minimal

37:10.395 --> 37:15.465
with this production, simple
set design and simple costumes,

37:16.635 --> 37:19.002
all of which will focus
the audience's attention

37:19.004 --> 37:20.804
on the physical manifestations

37:20.806 --> 37:24.708
of Jeremiah and
Meghan's inner lives.

37:24.710 --> 37:25.842
Look at this.

37:30.749 --> 37:33.250
- Good day, Jeremiah.

37:33.252 --> 37:35.018
How fare thee?

37:35.020 --> 37:38.021
- Has she fuckin'
lost it already?

37:38.023 --> 37:40.757
- There's method to her madness.

37:42.961 --> 37:44.056
- Wankers.

37:53.972 --> 37:56.873
- You don't remember me, do you?

37:56.875 --> 37:59.943
- No.

37:59.944 --> 38:03.012
- I'm Stevie, the hair and
makeup on the pizza commercial.

38:03.015 --> 38:05.015
Oh, it was only a bit
of lipstick and powder,

38:05.017 --> 38:05.849
less than five minutes.

38:05.851 --> 38:07.317
- Yeah, whatever.

38:09.021 --> 38:10.654
- Is that alright?

38:10.656 --> 38:13.490
Just let me know if it hurts.

38:13.492 --> 38:16.359
- It's more humiliating
than painful.

38:16.361 --> 38:17.627
- [Stevie] Oh, don't worry.

38:17.629 --> 38:21.298
Your natural good looks
will shine through.

38:26.004 --> 38:28.305
- According to Orson
Welles out there,

38:28.307 --> 38:30.473
the warts are the
symbols of the guilt

38:30.475 --> 38:32.909
beneath Jeremiah Ulysses's rage,

38:32.911 --> 38:36.479
the outgrowth of the shame
he tries to make others feel.

38:36.481 --> 38:40.717
What a load of bollocks!

38:40.719 --> 38:44.454
- Poor Jeremiah. [chuckles]

39:15.053 --> 39:17.787
[Rupert grunts]

39:19.458 --> 39:20.357
- Ah.

39:21.993 --> 39:24.361
That is just a little reminder

39:24.363 --> 39:27.530
that our time here is limited.

39:27.532 --> 39:31.901
Now Tamsin, we need you
to get down on your knees.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.970
- Don't tell us you haven't
really don't that before.

39:33.972 --> 39:36.539
- And Rupert, if you just
stand in front of her there.

39:36.541 --> 39:37.374
That's it.

39:37.376 --> 39:38.408
That's great.

39:38.410 --> 39:39.576
That's great.

39:41.146 --> 39:45.081
Tamsin, feel your scars.

39:46.518 --> 39:50.387
Feel the history of
abuse on your skin.

39:50.389 --> 39:54.524
Rupert, become aware of
the ugliness of your warts.

39:58.463 --> 39:59.463
Action!

40:00.832 --> 40:02.732
- What are you doing,
you filthy slut?

40:02.734 --> 40:03.933
What are you--

40:03.935 --> 40:04.968
- [Geoffrey] Rupert,
it's what vile practice

40:04.970 --> 40:06.503
doth now endeavor.

40:06.505 --> 40:08.071
- Whence stem these
shameless desires?

40:08.073 --> 40:09.472
Surely, thou art fallen into--

40:09.474 --> 40:12.108
- What vile endeavor
doth thou now practice?

40:12.110 --> 40:15.545
Whence stem these
shameless desires?

40:15.547 --> 40:18.782
Surely, thou art fallen
into the serpent's pit

40:18.784 --> 40:21.818
for thou manifest the
manners of a harlot!

40:21.820 --> 40:23.720
- 'Tis but the day of
the groom's matrimony,

40:23.722 --> 40:27.557
which hath in store
the bride's maidenhood.

40:27.559 --> 40:30.860
- Marriage is a sacrament
to our divine father

40:30.862 --> 40:32.896
and gives thee not
permission for wantonness.

40:32.898 --> 40:35.598
- [Tamsin] [mumbles]
I meant to please.

40:35.600 --> 40:38.034
- [Rupert] Thou pleases me
better with thy modesty.

40:38.036 --> 40:38.968
- Cut, cut.

40:40.539 --> 40:43.506
Now I think we're going in
slightly the wrong direction.

40:43.508 --> 40:46.109
Jeremiah Ulysses is
always a volcano.

40:46.111 --> 40:49.546
He's either erupting
or he's about to erupt.

40:49.548 --> 40:53.616
Wrath, annoyance, vexation,
exasperation, crossness,

40:53.618 --> 40:58.588
irritation, outrage,
indignation, resentment and fury,

40:58.590 --> 41:00.657
that's your palette, buddy.

41:03.028 --> 41:05.895
- What vile endeavor
doth thou now practice?

41:05.897 --> 41:09.732
Whence stem these
shameless desires?

41:09.734 --> 41:13.670
Surely, thou art fallen
into the serpent's pit

41:13.672 --> 41:16.673
for thou manifest the
manners of a harlot!

41:16.675 --> 41:18.908
- 'Tis but the day of
the groom's matrimony,

41:18.910 --> 41:21.578
which hath in store
the bride's maidenhood.

41:21.580 --> 41:24.581
- Marriage is a sacrament
to our divine father

41:24.583 --> 41:26.716
and gives thee not
permission for wantonness!

41:26.718 --> 41:29.185
- [mumbles] I meant to please.

41:29.187 --> 41:32.555
- Thou pleases me
better with thy modesty!

41:32.557 --> 41:34.924
[Tamsin sobs]

41:47.272 --> 41:49.739
- You seem different today.

41:51.643 --> 41:54.611
- [Rupert] Sex is in the air.

41:54.613 --> 41:55.912
I can smell it.

41:58.083 --> 42:00.783
- Where does it smell strongest?

42:03.588 --> 42:05.154
- The makeup room.

42:06.625 --> 42:07.924
- Who's in there?

42:09.694 --> 42:10.793
- Stevie.

42:12.163 --> 42:15.131
- [Angus] And you like Stevie?

42:15.133 --> 42:18.701
- She certainly put a
spring in my shorts.

42:22.007 --> 42:23.740
- Oh, I'm so sorry, Angus.

42:23.742 --> 42:26.809
- You mustn't come
in here, Olga.

42:26.811 --> 42:28.945
You have to leave immediately.

42:28.947 --> 42:30.780
- Vilim has soaked me
with his water pistol,

42:30.782 --> 42:34.117
and now I have nothing to wear.

42:34.119 --> 42:35.285
- Look at my wife's wardrobe.

42:35.287 --> 42:36.786
Now please leave.

42:44.930 --> 42:46.696
I'm sorry about that.

42:46.698 --> 42:48.998
- My pleasure entirely.

42:49.000 --> 42:53.202
Absolutely terrific
pair of tits.

42:53.204 --> 42:55.638
I bet you have some fun with
them when the kids are asleep.

42:55.640 --> 42:56.739
- I'm happily married.

42:56.741 --> 42:57.974
- Nothing wrong
with a threesome.

42:57.976 --> 42:59.742
- [Angus] Would you
like threesomes?

42:59.744 --> 43:01.778
- Is that an invitation?

43:03.048 --> 43:06.583
- When was your first
sexual encounter?

43:08.720 --> 43:13.356
- Blowjob behind the cricket
pavilion when I was 19.

43:13.358 --> 43:15.191
- Nothing before that?

43:15.193 --> 43:16.125
- No, no, no, no.

43:16.127 --> 43:17.594
She got right down to it.

43:17.596 --> 43:21.297
- No, I meant no sexual
experiences before that?

43:22.701 --> 43:24.601
I just thought someone
as sexual as you

43:24.603 --> 43:28.071
would have been active
from an earlier age.

43:34.746 --> 43:36.879
- And how old were you, Angus?

43:36.881 --> 43:39.849
And sex with relatives
doesn't count.

43:41.920 --> 43:43.286
- What are you
angry about, Rupert?

43:43.288 --> 43:45.154
- You trying to make
out that I couldn't--

43:45.156 --> 43:47.657
- [Angus] Couldn't what,
couldn't get a girl?

43:47.659 --> 43:52.228
- I can get any fucking girl
I want, including yours.

43:52.230 --> 43:54.931
- Who are you competing with?

43:58.103 --> 44:00.970
Who was it who
called you a freak?

45:04.936 --> 45:07.370
[phone buzzes]

45:08.440 --> 45:10.306
- [Oliver] Harvey is
flying in from New York

45:10.308 --> 45:12.041
for the press night.

45:16.381 --> 45:17.313
- [Jackie] I'm Jackie.

45:17.315 --> 45:19.982
Stevie's got stuck in traffic.

45:21.052 --> 45:22.118
- That's a shame.

45:22.120 --> 45:25.354
I was hoping to get
stuck into Stevie.

45:29.994 --> 45:32.395
You've got a lovely touch.

45:32.397 --> 45:34.130
- [Jackie] Not too hard?

45:34.132 --> 45:36.432
- No, but I'll tell you what is.

45:36.434 --> 45:38.768
- [Jackie] I'm going to
pretend you didn't say that.

45:38.770 --> 45:42.004
- Okay, and I'll pretend
you're not giving me a boner.

45:42.006 --> 45:43.072
- [Jackie] They have
sexual harassment laws

45:43.074 --> 45:44.841
in the theater too, you know.

45:44.843 --> 45:46.075
- Well, that's good.

45:46.077 --> 45:47.510
Everyone should get a
chance to experience it.

45:47.512 --> 45:49.512
- [Jackie] I'm serious.

45:50.381 --> 45:51.381
- I know.

45:52.417 --> 45:54.484
Suddenly things aren't
so hard anymore.

45:54.486 --> 45:58.488
I'm gonna close my eyes
and think about Stevie.

46:07.966 --> 46:10.399
[Rupert moans]

46:18.343 --> 46:19.242
Yeah.

46:22.113 --> 46:25.047
You have lovely eyes.

46:27.252 --> 46:29.552
Do you like my warts?

46:29.554 --> 46:32.455
- Very becoming, my lord.

46:32.457 --> 46:35.091
- That dress really suits you.

46:35.093 --> 46:38.194
It makes you look
like a wanton whore.

46:38.196 --> 46:39.428
- Thou knows very well

46:39.430 --> 46:43.065
that thou disapproves of
such things, Jeremiah.

46:43.067 --> 46:45.935
- Me disapprove of that?

46:45.937 --> 46:49.305
- Thou was disapproving
on our wedding night.

46:49.307 --> 46:51.140
- Well, give me another chance.

46:51.142 --> 46:54.177
I beseech ye, give
me another chance.

46:54.179 --> 46:57.180
- Nice improv, but
wrong direction.

46:58.249 --> 47:01.184
Let's just take it from the top.

47:03.288 --> 47:05.388
And action.

47:06.825 --> 47:11.894
- Thou art corrupted
by thy vain fancies.

47:13.031 --> 47:17.133
The god thy service
is thy own appetite.

47:18.169 --> 47:22.371
Thou scorns sweet
innocence and chastity.

47:23.208 --> 47:28.277
Thou art wholly
wanton and lascivious.

47:30.148 --> 47:31.080
- Cut.

47:31.081 --> 47:32.013
Are you still on the improv?

47:32.016 --> 47:34.050
What's with the big sex thing?

47:34.052 --> 47:35.952
I'm sorry, it's wrong.

47:40.992 --> 47:41.924
- What's wrong?

47:41.926 --> 47:44.460
- It's completely inappropriate.

47:46.197 --> 47:48.264
Where's the anger?

47:48.266 --> 47:50.366
Wake up, Rupert.

47:50.368 --> 47:51.267
Wake up.

47:52.303 --> 47:54.003
Wake up!

47:54.005 --> 47:55.371
- Touch me again and I'll
take your fucking head off!

47:55.373 --> 47:56.472
- That's it, that's it.

47:56.474 --> 47:58.474
Keep it there.

47:58.476 --> 47:59.976
- Fuck you!

47:59.978 --> 48:01.377
- Action.

48:01.379 --> 48:03.613
- Thou carnal transgression
goes not unnoticed.

48:03.615 --> 48:06.582
Thy heap God's heavy
wrath upon thy head.

48:06.584 --> 48:10.286
Thou art corrupted
by thy vain fancies.

48:10.288 --> 48:14.223
The god thy service
is thine own appetite!

48:14.225 --> 48:18.361
Thou scorns sweet
innocence and chastity.

48:18.363 --> 48:23.132
Thou art wholly
wanton and lascivious!

48:23.134 --> 48:24.033
- Oh!

48:27.071 --> 48:29.372
Rupert, that was brilliant.

48:30.441 --> 48:34.143
Tamsin, I love the blinking.

48:35.046 --> 48:36.279
It's inspired.

48:52.931 --> 48:56.399
- He thinks me corrupted
by vain fancies.

48:57.435 --> 48:59.168
- The old man getting
you down again?

48:59.170 --> 49:02.138
- I've been known to scorn
sweet innocence and chastity.

49:02.140 --> 49:05.341
I sought nothing but
love and companionship.

49:05.343 --> 49:07.343
- [Stevie] He's just angry.

49:07.345 --> 49:09.145
If it wasn't you,
it'd be someone else.

49:09.147 --> 49:11.314
Don't take it personally.

49:12.517 --> 49:15.184
- And what of God's heavy
wrath I heap upon myself?

49:15.186 --> 49:17.586
- I'm not sure you do
heap it upon yourself.

49:17.588 --> 49:22.191
Maybe that's what he does and
he wants to put it on you.

49:22.193 --> 49:23.726
- Thou art too kind.

49:25.029 --> 49:26.696
- People can be like that.

49:26.698 --> 49:28.397
- No, I mean it.

49:28.399 --> 49:32.401
Thou threatens to undermine
my guilt and shame.

49:34.105 --> 49:38.474
- Ooh, let's talk about your
journey to the new world.

49:49.420 --> 49:51.554
- You've never
seen warts before?

49:51.556 --> 49:54.123
Here, have one.

49:57.562 --> 50:01.764
If that fucking asshole even
thinks about slapping me again,

50:01.766 --> 50:05.434
I'm gonna break every
bone in his fuckin' hand!

50:05.436 --> 50:07.036
- [Stevie] Or perhaps
you could heap

50:07.038 --> 50:09.338
God's heavy wrath upon him.

50:12.610 --> 50:15.144
- For fuck's sake [mumbles]!

50:15.146 --> 50:16.479
- I'm so sorry.

50:18.116 --> 50:19.448
- Only kidding.

50:40.605 --> 50:41.470
Hey.

50:42.640 --> 50:43.640
I'm sorry.

50:45.176 --> 50:46.642
I'm really sorry.

50:48.780 --> 50:50.613
- It's alright, don't worry.

50:50.615 --> 50:54.583
I know you have to be
angry for your character.

50:59.057 --> 51:01.791
[melancholy music]

51:14.639 --> 51:16.305
- It has to stop.

51:16.307 --> 51:18.074
- You became aware
of what was happening

51:18.076 --> 51:20.342
almost while it was happening.

51:20.344 --> 51:22.645
Isn't that unusual for you?

51:24.649 --> 51:27.583
- I have to get
rid of him somehow.

51:27.585 --> 51:29.685
- [Angus] Your anger?

51:29.687 --> 51:30.786
- Yes.

51:31.689 --> 51:34.190
- No other parts of yourself?

51:35.393 --> 51:36.792
- No, him.

51:36.794 --> 51:41.664
- [Angus] But without him,
you wouldn't be in the play.

51:42.733 --> 51:44.767
- I'm an actor.

51:44.769 --> 51:46.836
I can build a character.

51:51.476 --> 51:54.810
I can't have him being
horrible to Stevie.

51:56.414 --> 52:00.549
- So you want him dead,
right, got rid of.

52:00.551 --> 52:01.450
- Yes.

52:01.452 --> 52:03.285
- You want him killed.

52:04.222 --> 52:05.454
- Whatever it takes.

52:05.456 --> 52:08.257
- So it's not just
him who's angry.

52:10.428 --> 52:11.627
I mean, you said
you want him dead.

52:11.629 --> 52:13.162
I've not heard him
wish the same for you.

52:13.164 --> 52:14.763
- He wants to ruin my life.

52:14.765 --> 52:15.865
He's a f...

52:16.834 --> 52:18.200
- [Angus] He's a what, Rupert?

52:18.202 --> 52:18.834
- It doesn't matter.

52:18.836 --> 52:20.503
- [Angus] He's a freak?

52:20.505 --> 52:25.174
Are you sure he's a freak,
Rupert, or is that really you?

52:29.680 --> 52:34.550
- [Rupert] What
is this bullshit?

52:34.552 --> 52:35.784
- No bullshit.

52:36.721 --> 52:38.821
- You were bullying him.

52:38.823 --> 52:41.557
What the fuck is that all about?

52:42.793 --> 52:45.294
- Have you been
bullied in the past?

52:45.295 --> 52:47.796
- [Rupert] Don't try and turn
the tables, you fuckin' prick!

52:47.798 --> 52:49.899
You were bullying him.

52:54.805 --> 52:57.773
- I'm surprised you're
so sensitive to her name.

52:57.775 --> 53:02.211
- I don't give a fuck
about it, but he does.

53:02.213 --> 53:03.746
- So you jumped in.

53:06.217 --> 53:08.651
- You were bullying him.

53:08.653 --> 53:12.388
- He became vulnerable
and you protected him.

53:12.390 --> 53:15.391
He does vulnerability,
you do anger.

53:15.393 --> 53:19.695
- More penetrating insights
from the great psychotherapist.

53:19.697 --> 53:23.599
- You hate vulnerability
and he hates anger.

53:23.601 --> 53:24.900
- Why does the great
psychotherapist

53:24.902 --> 53:26.735
have to bully his client?

53:26.737 --> 53:28.837
- [Angus] You two need
each other's help, badly!

53:28.839 --> 53:30.639
- Maybe it's you who needs help.

53:30.641 --> 53:31.774
We're doing just fine.

53:31.776 --> 53:32.975
- Oh, you're doing brilliantly.

53:32.977 --> 53:35.778
Why can't you admit
you need help?

53:35.780 --> 53:37.446
- What, the kind of help
you've been offering?

53:37.448 --> 53:39.615
- Well, you need somebody's.

53:39.617 --> 53:43.819
Without your anger,
he will never survive.

53:43.821 --> 53:46.388
And without his vulnerability,

53:47.925 --> 53:49.992
you'll never feel loved.

54:16.254 --> 54:19.388
- It's okay to feel vulnerable.

54:19.390 --> 54:20.990
Taking risks and feeling exposed

54:20.992 --> 54:25.327
are an important part
of a healthy lifestyle.

54:25.329 --> 54:28.597
Protect yourself if you need to,

54:28.599 --> 54:31.600
but you should take
the risk first.

54:37.408 --> 54:40.042
It's easier said than done, eh.

54:43.781 --> 54:46.348
[phone rings]

54:51.055 --> 54:52.721
- [Stevie] Hello?

54:52.723 --> 54:54.056
- Hi, Stevie.

54:54.058 --> 54:57.326
It's Rupert, from the play.

54:57.328 --> 55:01.063
Listen, I just wanted
to say I'm really sorry

55:01.065 --> 55:03.899
about the way I was
with you this afternoon.

55:03.901 --> 55:05.734
It's an acting thing.

55:06.804 --> 55:08.070
The part I play
has all this anger,

55:08.072 --> 55:10.739
and sometimes it spills over.

55:12.743 --> 55:16.312
I know it's hurtful
and deeply unpleasant,

55:18.049 --> 55:20.049
but I really didn't mean it.

55:20.051 --> 55:22.051
- [Stevie] It's okay.

55:23.354 --> 55:25.988
I was worried you
didn't like me.

55:33.931 --> 55:37.366
- Oh, you don't need
to worry about that.

55:37.368 --> 55:38.567
- [Stevie] Good.

55:40.604 --> 55:42.671
- Can I buy you a drink?

55:47.345 --> 55:48.944
- You seem different.

55:50.381 --> 55:53.349
- It's the electrifying
effect you have on me.

55:53.351 --> 55:56.385
- Is this another
role you're playing?

55:58.489 --> 56:00.989
- What's that gorgeous smell?

56:02.426 --> 56:03.359
Are you wearing perfume?

56:03.361 --> 56:05.728
- I put a little on my neck.

56:06.764 --> 56:07.859
- May I?

56:18.642 --> 56:21.110
[Stevie giggles]

56:21.112 --> 56:24.012
Why, you smell
good enough to eat.

56:25.750 --> 56:27.149
- Rupert.

56:27.151 --> 56:28.150
Not here.

56:28.152 --> 56:29.151
- Back to yours?

56:29.153 --> 56:30.919
- You need to go
a little slower.

56:30.921 --> 56:33.055
- We can do that.

56:33.057 --> 56:34.123
- Generally.

56:35.960 --> 56:37.693
- You don't want me.

56:38.496 --> 56:40.963
- That's not what I'm saying.

56:44.802 --> 56:46.535
- You don't want me.

56:53.043 --> 56:55.944
- We both have Sunday off.

56:55.946 --> 56:57.980
Why don't you come
over to my house.

56:57.982 --> 57:00.949
My parents are having
this barbecue lunch thing,

57:00.951 --> 57:03.719
you know, burgers,
hotdogs, beer.

57:06.424 --> 57:08.457
You could meet the family.

57:09.860 --> 57:11.627
What do you think?

57:14.698 --> 57:19.768
- I think I feel a bit
uncomfortable about what I just did.

57:20.438 --> 57:23.138
- Oh, no, please don't.

57:23.140 --> 57:25.507
You were just
being affectionate.

57:25.509 --> 57:27.543
I like that in men.

57:27.545 --> 57:29.611
Anyway, I was flattered.

57:45.529 --> 57:48.130
[Stevie giggles]

57:50.968 --> 57:53.635
So will you come?

57:56.841 --> 57:59.842
To the party at my
house on Sunday.

58:02.079 --> 58:02.978
- Yeah.

58:03.914 --> 58:06.048
Yeah, I'd really love to.

58:09.620 --> 58:12.788
- Just so you know, my
mom likes younger men.

58:12.790 --> 58:14.056
So does my dad.

58:14.058 --> 58:17.860
But they won't bother
you if you're with me.

58:17.862 --> 58:18.994
Are you okay?

58:19.864 --> 58:21.763
- Yeah, I'm fine.

58:21.765 --> 58:23.065
- Are you sure?

58:25.636 --> 58:29.638
- I just need to go to
the little boys' room.

58:37.681 --> 58:39.648
My name is Rupert Lindsay.

58:39.650 --> 58:40.816
My name is Rupert Lindsay.

58:40.818 --> 58:42.851
My name is Rupert Lindsay.

58:42.853 --> 58:45.087
I'm 33 years old.

58:45.089 --> 58:46.855
I'm playing the lead role

58:46.857 --> 58:50.559
in The Fatal Blasphemy of
Jeremiah Ulysses's Boundless Rage,

58:50.561 --> 58:53.896
soon to have a West
End run, hopefully.

58:55.299 --> 58:58.967
I'm having a nice evening with
Stevie, who's just invited me

58:58.969 --> 59:03.272
to a barbecue with her mom
and dad who both like...

59:09.647 --> 59:13.215
I wonder how many tiles
there are in here.

59:25.729 --> 59:26.862
- Are you okay?

59:27.798 --> 59:29.765
You look a bit ill.

59:29.767 --> 59:32.200
- Something didn't
agree with me,

59:32.202 --> 59:34.603
but I'm fine now.

59:34.605 --> 59:36.772
I feel like myself again.

59:38.208 --> 59:39.875
- Have you had enough?

59:39.877 --> 59:41.277
Do you wanna leave?

59:41.279 --> 59:42.278
- I don't wanna
spoil the evening.

59:42.279 --> 59:43.245
- Oh, it's okay.

59:43.247 --> 59:44.580
I understand.

59:59.263 --> 01:00:01.597
I had a really lovely evening.

01:00:01.599 --> 01:00:02.599
Thank you.

01:00:11.175 --> 01:00:15.277
Oh, you can be angry tomorrow,

01:00:15.279 --> 01:00:19.881
but please don't be angry
on Sunday at the barbecue.

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:25.387
[melancholy music]

01:01:49.406 --> 01:01:53.008
- Which fucking idiot
left the window open?

01:01:57.448 --> 01:01:59.848
Fucking table!

01:02:00.718 --> 01:02:04.753
[grunts] Fucking bastard!

01:02:04.755 --> 01:02:06.988
[screams]

01:02:26.176 --> 01:02:31.246
- [Boxing Commentator]
[mumbles] Another right,

01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:33.381
another left.

01:02:33.383 --> 01:02:37.986
The ref's gonna have to
stop it somehow. [mumbles]

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.968
[melancholy music]

01:03:05.983 --> 01:03:06.983
- Animals.

01:03:22.432 --> 01:03:25.500
[suspenseful music]

01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:46.154
- I'm telling you,
this guy has got it.

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:47.389
Yeah.

01:03:47.391 --> 01:03:49.257
Do you remember Tamsin,
first time we saw her?

01:03:49.259 --> 01:03:50.458
Same thing, raw.

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:51.393
There he is.

01:03:51.395 --> 01:03:55.163
There's my boy. [chuckles]

01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:00.368
- Twat.

01:04:05.242 --> 01:04:07.175
- Did you hear that?

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:09.211
Yeah, that was him.

01:04:09.213 --> 01:04:10.212
Oh, he calls me all
sorts of things.

01:04:10.214 --> 01:04:11.446
I don't care.

01:04:11.448 --> 01:04:12.881
Well, it's part of it.

01:04:12.883 --> 01:04:15.083
Listen, he's amazing,
and I'm molding him.

01:04:15.085 --> 01:04:18.520
He's like clay, fresh
clay, and I'm molding it.

01:04:18.522 --> 01:04:20.121
And I'm creating something,

01:04:20.123 --> 01:04:22.290
and I'm creating
something wonderful.

01:04:22.292 --> 01:04:24.059
It's beautiful.

01:04:24.061 --> 01:04:27.062
About six-foot-two, buzz cut,

01:04:27.064 --> 01:04:30.165
mean eyes, Scottish, obviously.

01:04:30.167 --> 01:04:31.266
Alright, mother, I've gotta go.

01:04:31.268 --> 01:04:33.034
I'm in there in five minutes.

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:34.269
- Thanks, Harry.

01:04:34.271 --> 01:04:36.304
Anything that you can
do to drum up publicity

01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:39.040
will be greatly appreciated.

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:42.344
I'm betting the farm on
this one, and the house,

01:04:42.346 --> 01:04:46.581
and the outbuildings
and 125 acres.

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.287
- Good morning, handsome.

01:04:52.289 --> 01:04:54.122
- What's so fucking
good about it?

01:04:54.124 --> 01:04:56.925
[dramatic music]

01:05:05.969 --> 01:05:08.370
- Harvey's not gonna
be able to make it.

01:05:08.372 --> 01:05:10.639
- Has anyone seen my pencils?

01:05:17.948 --> 01:05:19.414
- [Man On Radio]
Well, of course,

01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:21.283
we're approaching the
climax of the rehearsals.

01:05:21.284 --> 01:05:23.151
This is always a very interesting
time and time, I think,

01:05:23.153 --> 01:05:27.222
when the director really,
really shows his work.

01:05:28.358 --> 01:05:30.492
- Get off my fucking ear!

01:05:34.665 --> 01:05:37.332
- Harvey is back on!

01:05:47.144 --> 01:05:51.112
I wish to Christ Harvey
would make up his mind!

01:05:54.384 --> 01:05:56.217
- That's it.

01:05:56.219 --> 01:05:58.219
All ready, Mr. Ulysses.

01:06:01.591 --> 01:06:04.092
[chuckles]

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:21.609
- [Geoffrey] Okay, let's pick
it up from where we left off.

01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:24.212
And action!

01:06:26.116 --> 01:06:30.118
- Thy solace fulfills
thy foul desires.

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:32.454
I'm afraid that which
I have long suspected.

01:06:32.456 --> 01:06:36.191
Thou art a wild drunkard
and a wanton whore.

01:06:37.561 --> 01:06:40.762
Thou hath concealed
thy shameless passions.

01:06:40.764 --> 01:06:42.197
- No.

01:06:42.199 --> 01:06:45.133
- Obscured them with
thy fraudulent masks.

01:06:45.135 --> 01:06:48.770
Thy veneer of chastity
and veil of rectitude,

01:06:50.073 --> 01:06:53.475
thy fallacious facade
of religious propriety.

01:06:58.548 --> 01:07:03.051
- I respect your instincts,
Rupert, I really do,

01:07:03.053 --> 01:07:06.454
but we are going to
have to step this up.

01:07:07.424 --> 01:07:11.493
Now as I've said,
Ulysses is always angry.

01:07:11.495 --> 01:07:13.461
His rage is infinite
and inexhaustible,

01:07:13.463 --> 01:07:15.563
and it builds right through

01:07:15.565 --> 01:07:17.465
until the last scene
of the third act,

01:07:17.467 --> 01:07:20.502
on the prow of the ship when
he finally directs his anger

01:07:20.504 --> 01:07:24.372
at God and experiences
God's wrath for him.

01:07:32.282 --> 01:07:34.616
- Who said God was
angry with him?

01:07:34.618 --> 01:07:37.719
- Well, what other
reaction can there be, hmm?

01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:41.556
This raging man
is never redeemed.

01:07:42.659 --> 01:07:47.228
There's no character arc
for Jeremiah Ulysses.

01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:51.533
And surely, this
is Marlowe's point,

01:07:51.535 --> 01:07:54.803
the theme beneath the premise.

01:07:54.805 --> 01:07:57.572
Ulysses can rage all he likes.

01:07:57.574 --> 01:08:00.608
It only brings forth
more of God's wrath.

01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:03.478
And this is why the ship sinks.

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:07.148
Ultimately, his rage damns him.

01:08:15.692 --> 01:08:19.194
Well, let's leave it
there for the day.

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:29.737
I'm very happy with
the first two acts.

01:08:29.738 --> 01:08:31.272
The third needs a little work,

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:34.109
but we can tackle
that on Monday.

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:39.613
- Monday is press night.

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:42.783
- Not until the evening.

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:49.424
Enjoy your Sunday off.

01:08:49.426 --> 01:08:52.694
Relax, unwind, let
it all sink in.

01:08:52.696 --> 01:08:55.229
Monday night's gonna be awesome.

01:08:55.232 --> 01:08:56.731
Hmm, okay, buddy.

01:09:04.207 --> 01:09:05.640
Yeah.

01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:08.443
- I've had this with all
this therapy bullshit!

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:09.410
It's not going anywhere.

01:09:09.412 --> 01:09:10.645
- Where do you want it to go?

01:09:10.647 --> 01:09:11.779
- I want it to go away.

01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:13.548
- And yet, here you
are paid upfront

01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:14.749
and hanging on my every word.

01:09:14.751 --> 01:09:15.817
- In your fucking dreams.

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:17.318
- On my every word, Rupert.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:18.752
You wait eagerly for it,

01:09:18.755 --> 01:09:20.587
cease it as soon as it
emerges and try and turn it

01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:22.424
into something you
could be angry about.

01:09:22.425 --> 01:09:24.259
You say you don't wanna be
here, so why the fuck are you?

01:09:24.261 --> 01:09:26.594
- Is this a new
psychotherapeutic tack,

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:29.531
swear at me and shock me
into a different response?

01:09:29.533 --> 01:09:32.233
Or is this the real
Angus emerging,

01:09:32.234 --> 01:09:33.902
the frustrated, the uptight--

01:09:33.904 --> 01:09:34.836
- Whatever.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.270
You want to be here, Rupert!

01:09:36.273 --> 01:09:37.337
Just admit it to yourself!

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.706
No one made you come here today,

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:39.941
and no one's making you stay!

01:09:39.943 --> 01:09:41.943
What do you want from therapy?

01:09:41.944 --> 01:09:44.511
- I'm sure you've got some
penetrating insights about that.

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:45.779
- That's all pretty
obvious, really.

01:09:45.782 --> 01:09:47.682
You're not exactly the
hardest book to read.

01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:49.017
You're wondering if perhaps

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:50.350
you might be in line
for a second chance.

01:09:50.353 --> 01:09:51.286
- At what?

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:52.687
- I don't know, happiness maybe,

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:54.889
a life where you can
react to bad situations

01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:57.425
if they happen rather than
always anticipating them.

01:09:57.427 --> 01:09:58.793
Or maybe it's love.

01:09:58.795 --> 01:10:02.697
Why else would you be
so unpleasant to Stevie?

01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:10.738
- You are such a fuckin' loser.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:11.870
- Say that again.

01:10:11.875 --> 01:10:12.807
- Fuck off!

01:10:12.809 --> 01:10:13.741
- Tell me I'm a fucking loser.

01:10:13.743 --> 01:10:14.609
- I'm sure you know that by now.

01:10:14.611 --> 01:10:15.877
- Just do it!

01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:16.811
Why is everything so
difficult with you?

01:10:16.813 --> 01:10:18.346
Tell me I'm a fucking loser!

01:10:18.348 --> 01:10:19.280
- Fuck you!

01:10:19.282 --> 01:10:19.948
- Protecting my feelings?

01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:20.782
- Yeah, right.

01:10:20.784 --> 01:10:22.584
- Digging your heels in.

01:10:22.586 --> 01:10:23.518
Just kidding.

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.719
- Oh, that's fuckin' hilarious.

01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:25.954
- Thank you.

01:10:25.956 --> 01:10:27.488
So who was it who called
you a fucking loser?

01:10:27.490 --> 01:10:28.423
- Jesus Christ, don't you
have ever fuckin' let up?

01:10:28.425 --> 01:10:29.357
- Say that to me again.

01:10:29.359 --> 01:10:30.558
Don't you ever fucking let up?

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:31.826
- You're not big
enough to bully me--

01:10:31.828 --> 01:10:33.995
- Who are you
talking to, Rupert?

01:10:33.997 --> 01:10:35.930
Freak, fucking loser.

01:10:35.932 --> 01:10:36.798
Don't you ever let up.

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:37.632
Leave me alone.

01:10:37.634 --> 01:10:38.633
He or a she?

01:10:38.635 --> 01:10:39.467
- He!

01:10:39.469 --> 01:10:40.401
- An older brother.

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:43.238
- I don't have an older brother!

01:10:44.674 --> 01:10:45.873
- Father then.

01:11:22.946 --> 01:11:25.680
[ominous music]

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.895
[Rupert groans]

01:12:27.644 --> 01:12:30.712
[suspenseful music]

01:12:52.068 --> 01:12:55.636
[knocking on door]

01:12:55.638 --> 01:12:57.138
[Stevie giggles]

01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:58.106
- Hi, sexy.

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:08.082
My mom likes younger men.

01:13:08.084 --> 01:13:09.384
So does my dad.

01:13:14.591 --> 01:13:18.126
Rupert, this is my mom, Sheila.

01:13:18.128 --> 01:13:21.396
- I feel like I
know you already.

01:13:21.398 --> 01:13:24.031
A star of the
stage in my garden.

01:13:25.402 --> 01:13:26.434
- [Rupert] Hi,
how are you doing?

01:13:26.436 --> 01:13:27.101
- This is my dad, Frank.

01:13:27.103 --> 01:13:29.137
- Ah, hello, mate.

01:13:29.139 --> 01:13:30.505
- [Rupert] Pleased to meet you.

01:13:30.507 --> 01:13:31.439
- Nice to meet you.

01:13:31.441 --> 01:13:33.508
- Let's get you a drink.

01:13:47.123 --> 01:13:49.490
[Stevie giggles]

01:13:49.492 --> 01:13:51.159
You obviously needed that.

01:13:51.161 --> 01:13:53.461
I just have to go check
on my Auntie Josie.

01:13:53.463 --> 01:13:54.996
Be back in a moment.

01:14:02.505 --> 01:14:03.638
- [Woman] Look at him.

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:07.475
Isn't he handsome? [laughs]

01:14:23.126 --> 01:14:24.859
- Oh, messy boy.

01:14:24.861 --> 01:14:27.628
You spilled ketchup
all down you.

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:30.164
Would you like me to take
that off and wash it for you?

01:14:30.166 --> 01:14:30.998
- [Rupert] No, it's okay.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:31.833
I'm fine.

01:14:31.835 --> 01:14:32.667
- No trouble.

01:14:32.669 --> 01:14:34.602
- [Rupert] I'm fine.

01:14:37.941 --> 01:14:39.173
What?

01:14:39.175 --> 01:14:40.675
Oh, oh, sorry, sorry.

01:14:40.677 --> 01:14:42.176
- Oh. [laughs]

01:14:42.178 --> 01:14:43.611
I see you've met Jake then.

01:14:43.613 --> 01:14:44.745
Go on then.

01:14:44.747 --> 01:14:45.880
Show him your muscles.

01:14:45.882 --> 01:14:47.482
Whoa, look at them biceps.

01:14:47.484 --> 01:14:48.115
Look at that.

01:14:48.117 --> 01:14:49.851
Go on. [laughs]

01:14:49.853 --> 01:14:52.220
He's shaping up very nicely.

01:14:52.222 --> 01:14:53.621
- [Rupert] Fuck!

01:14:58.561 --> 01:14:59.660
- Sorry.

01:15:00.563 --> 01:15:02.129
I got [mumbles] by
my cousin Jacob.

01:15:02.131 --> 01:15:04.565
He keeps on talking about
how he's been made a cavalier

01:15:04.567 --> 01:15:07.201
in his battle
reenactment society.

01:15:08.605 --> 01:15:10.037
Are you alright?

01:15:10.039 --> 01:15:10.938
- [Rupert] I'm fine.

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:12.573
- Come on.

01:15:12.575 --> 01:15:14.509
Let's go to my room.

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:19.680
- [Man] Hey, has anyone
seen Jack's bloody pants?

01:15:20.783 --> 01:15:23.651
[upbeat music]

01:16:08.097 --> 01:16:10.831
- I've gotta go to the bathroom.

01:16:11.634 --> 01:16:13.034
- Don't be long.

01:16:48.071 --> 01:16:50.805
[Rupert grunts]

01:16:54.043 --> 01:16:56.110
Anyone want kiddie porn?

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:01.882
You fucking pedophiles!

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:04.952
- What's going on?

01:17:04.954 --> 01:17:06.354
- Ask the child molesters!

01:17:06.356 --> 01:17:07.722
- [Stevie] What are
you talking about?

01:17:07.724 --> 01:17:08.623
- Fuck you!

01:17:08.625 --> 01:17:09.256
- What's happened?

01:17:09.258 --> 01:17:10.825
- Fuck all of you!

01:17:13.329 --> 01:17:16.397
[suspenseful music]

01:18:28.404 --> 01:18:32.306
Time to put us all out
of our misery for good.

01:18:45.154 --> 01:18:47.221
[knocking on door]

01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:48.456
- [Dad] Rupie!

01:18:50.026 --> 01:18:51.058
It's your dad.

01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:55.996
Are you hiding in there?

01:18:58.034 --> 01:18:59.433
I'm sorry.

01:18:59.435 --> 01:19:02.069
I haven't got the champagne.

01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:04.105
Check never came.

01:19:04.107 --> 01:19:06.841
Someone probably nicked it.

01:19:06.843 --> 01:19:08.943
So I'm wondering
if you can lend me

01:19:08.945 --> 01:19:10.911
a couple of hundred quid.

01:19:10.913 --> 01:19:12.446
Not for your booze, no, no.

01:19:12.448 --> 01:19:16.817
Just essentials, getting
by, surviving, you know.

01:19:19.922 --> 01:19:21.021
Rupie.

01:19:23.059 --> 01:19:24.759
Are you in there?

01:19:41.544 --> 01:19:44.278
[Rupert grunts]

01:19:46.349 --> 01:19:47.414
[phone buzzes]

01:19:47.416 --> 01:19:49.116
- What the fuck do you want?

01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:50.985
- [Dolores] Oh, Rupert.

01:19:50.987 --> 01:19:53.020
I thought you'd like to
know the word's got out

01:19:53.022 --> 01:19:55.289
that you're playing
opposite Tamsin Hollonby.

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:57.491
There's quite a buzz around you.

01:19:57.493 --> 01:19:59.026
People are asking for your reel

01:19:59.028 --> 01:20:01.495
and checking your availability.

01:20:01.497 --> 01:20:03.864
If you can get good
reviews for this,

01:20:03.866 --> 01:20:06.867
it's all going to
take off for you.

01:20:10.406 --> 01:20:11.906
Rupert?

01:20:11.908 --> 01:20:13.107
Rupert?

01:20:13.109 --> 01:20:17.178
Are you still there? [chuckles]

01:20:29.058 --> 01:20:32.893
- How am I supposed
to pull this off?

01:20:32.895 --> 01:20:35.496
Rehearsals were
a complete blank.

01:20:36.966 --> 01:20:39.567
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:20:39.569 --> 01:20:42.837
[suspenseful music]

01:21:07.263 --> 01:21:09.263
- [Oliver] Are you okay?

01:21:09.265 --> 01:21:11.031
You look terrible.

01:21:12.101 --> 01:21:14.168
- Dad died in the night.

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:18.939
- You poor thing.

01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:24.478
- [Geoffrey] Cancel
today's rehearsals.

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:27.181
- What about the third act?

01:21:27.183 --> 01:21:29.216
- [Geoffrey] It'll be fine.

01:21:29.218 --> 01:21:30.317
- Yes.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:32.887
Of course it will.

01:21:32.889 --> 01:21:35.356
There's nothing to worry about.

01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:57.044
- Maybe I can ramp up my
character's motivation.

01:21:57.046 --> 01:22:00.180
Marlowe let himself
down a bit there.

01:22:07.556 --> 01:22:10.991
Father was a pastor
who was angry with God

01:22:10.993 --> 01:22:13.294
but too devout to admit it.

01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:17.965
So he fathered a son to
absorb the father's rage.

01:22:17.967 --> 01:22:22.036
Papa was always bullying
and manipulative.

01:22:22.038 --> 01:22:26.407
He twisted everything 'round
to make his problems my fault.

01:22:26.409 --> 01:22:28.042
I must be wrong

01:22:28.044 --> 01:22:31.712
because papa was possessed
of a great fondness

01:22:31.714 --> 01:22:36.317
for lashing my bare
buttocks with his belt.

01:22:36.319 --> 01:22:39.620
The lashes stung terribly.

01:22:43.459 --> 01:22:46.060
I can feel their bite still.

01:22:49.398 --> 01:22:51.999
But there was worse to come.

01:22:54.570 --> 01:22:59.640
Papa was aroused by
the beatings sexually.

01:23:02.745 --> 01:23:05.412
And then one day, it happened.

01:23:06.382 --> 01:23:10.050
After a fierce belting,

01:23:10.052 --> 01:23:15.122
papa could no longer
contain his vile urges!

01:23:17.126 --> 01:23:22.196
He bent me over a bale of straw
and raped me in the cowshed,

01:23:23.366 --> 01:23:25.733
the low moans of the cattle

01:23:25.735 --> 01:23:30.471
merging with my own
strangled cries of anguish!

01:23:30.473 --> 01:23:33.240
For shame, for shame!

01:23:33.242 --> 01:23:35.542
He was a man of God!

01:23:35.544 --> 01:23:38.479
You bullying, manipulative
piece of shit!

01:23:38.481 --> 01:23:41.382
You utter fucking
scumbag bastard!

01:23:44.553 --> 01:23:46.553
- Rupert, how are you?

01:23:46.555 --> 01:23:48.489
- I'm angry, dickhead.

01:23:48.491 --> 01:23:49.423
- [Oliver] Excellent.

01:23:49.425 --> 01:23:50.457
- [Rupert] Faggot.

01:23:50.459 --> 01:23:51.291
- [Oliver] Nice one.

01:23:51.293 --> 01:23:52.126
- Ass bandit!

01:23:52.128 --> 01:23:53.660
- That's the spirit.

01:23:56.532 --> 01:24:01.435
- Jackie, will you do this
actor's makeup for me, please?

01:24:01.437 --> 01:24:03.170
- What's her fuckin' problem?

01:24:03.172 --> 01:24:05.706
[dramatic music]

01:24:36.105 --> 01:24:39.073
- The critics are
in the front row.

01:24:51.587 --> 01:24:54.321
Let's see if we can pull it off.

01:24:55.291 --> 01:24:57.357
- It's gonna be awesome.

01:25:06.535 --> 01:25:09.870
- What vile endeavor
doth thou now practice?

01:25:09.872 --> 01:25:12.673
Whence stem these
shameless desires?

01:25:12.675 --> 01:25:16.810
Surely, thou art fallen
into the serpent's pit

01:25:16.812 --> 01:25:19.413
for thou manifest the
manners of a harlot!

01:25:19.415 --> 01:25:21.281
- 'Tis but the day of
the groom's matrimony,

01:25:21.283 --> 01:25:23.617
which hath in store
the bride's maidenhood.

01:25:23.619 --> 01:25:27.387
- Marriage is a sacrament
to our divine father

01:25:27.389 --> 01:25:29.756
and gives thee not
permission for wantonness.

01:25:29.758 --> 01:25:32.659
- [Tamsin] [mumbles]
I meant to please.

01:25:32.661 --> 01:25:35.896
- [Rupert] Thou pleases me
better with thy modesty!

01:25:35.898 --> 01:25:38.699
[dramatic music]

01:26:02.758 --> 01:26:05.759
[audience applauds]

01:26:08.497 --> 01:26:10.397
- One down, two to go.

01:26:15.771 --> 01:26:18.805
- [mumbles] laughed
in the street,

01:26:18.807 --> 01:26:22.676
but thy scorn no joy
with men [mumbles].

01:26:22.678 --> 01:26:25.879
- These were thy dear
friends, my lord,

01:26:25.881 --> 01:26:28.749
John Clayton, Henry
Cuthbert and Darby.

01:26:28.751 --> 01:26:31.785
- Thou dares to answer
thy husband back!

01:26:31.787 --> 01:26:33.287
- [Tamsin] I beg thy kind
forgiveness, my lord.

01:26:33.289 --> 01:26:34.521
I merely thought--

01:26:34.523 --> 01:26:36.790
- You'd go into the
tavern with these men?

01:26:36.792 --> 01:26:39.693
- I but supped the ale
With thy kindred friends.

01:26:39.695 --> 01:26:43.463
- Thou shalt taste the
leather of my whip!

01:26:43.465 --> 01:26:46.233
- [Tamsin] Henceforth I deny
mirth and ale in public.

01:26:46.235 --> 01:26:48.869
- As indeed thou shall
deny them in private!

01:26:48.871 --> 01:26:53.941
Ale is the devil's brew,
and mirth, his work.

01:26:55.244 --> 01:26:57.511
- Has there yet to
be no solace for me?

01:26:57.513 --> 01:27:01.548
- Thy solace fulfills
thy foul desires.

01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:05.786
I fear that which I
have long suspected.

01:27:05.788 --> 01:27:10.290
Thou art a wild drunkard
and a wanton whore!

01:27:10.292 --> 01:27:11.192
- No.

01:27:19.535 --> 01:27:20.735
- Oh, fuck.

01:27:26.442 --> 01:27:31.511
- Thy wicked carnal
desires consume me.

01:27:32.848 --> 01:27:33.914
- what's he doing?

01:27:33.916 --> 01:27:35.549
- I don't know.

01:27:35.551 --> 01:27:40.020
- As they devour the
sanctity of our marriage,

01:27:41.557 --> 01:27:46.627
why thou hath conceal
thy shameful passions.

01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:49.896
- What's he looking at?

01:27:49.898 --> 01:27:54.468
- Obscured them with
my fraudulent masks.

01:27:55.871 --> 01:27:59.806
- Am I so base, thou cannot
cast thy gaze upon me?

01:27:59.808 --> 01:28:01.575
- What's she saying?

01:28:01.577 --> 01:28:04.011
- Good girl, Tamsin, good girl.

01:28:05.948 --> 01:28:09.583
- Thine eyes should
follow thy castigation.

01:28:17.059 --> 01:28:18.558
[Tamsin sobs]

01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:23.630
- Thy veneer of chastity
and veil of rectitude,

01:28:27.736 --> 01:28:32.806
thy fallacious facade
of religious propriety.

01:28:34.376 --> 01:28:35.942
- Come on, Rupert.

01:28:37.446 --> 01:28:42.449
- Disguised as thy
prurience and cupidity,

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:49.589
dost have torment
my afflicted soul.

01:29:10.079 --> 01:29:11.645
- Wake up, Rupert!

01:29:13.849 --> 01:29:15.682
You can do it, buddy!

01:29:20.089 --> 01:29:22.823
- You cunt!

01:29:27.062 --> 01:29:28.062
- Yes.

01:29:28.764 --> 01:29:29.764
Yes.

01:29:33.402 --> 01:29:36.036
It's gonna be alright.

01:29:36.038 --> 01:29:38.038
- Moment of truth.

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:40.674
- And the truth will out.

01:29:40.676 --> 01:29:45.746
- The book of Hebrew
admonishes us still.

01:29:46.849 --> 01:29:50.984
Let matrimony be held
in honor among all.

01:29:51.954 --> 01:29:54.688
Permit not the
marriage bed be defiled

01:29:54.690 --> 01:29:59.760
lest the wrath of God be
thy judge of immorality!

01:30:03.065 --> 01:30:08.135
Yet, thou judge not
my marriage bed!

01:30:11.039 --> 01:30:16.109
Virtue, righteousness,
morality were mine.

01:30:20.082 --> 01:30:24.518
Thou bounteous rewards
were covenanted me.

01:30:25.587 --> 01:30:29.556
Yet, thou hath recompensed
me with betrayal.

01:30:34.129 --> 01:30:39.199
Treachery and scorn
are my sorry return.

01:30:47.209 --> 01:30:52.446
I settled thy score
with bitter wages.

01:30:56.452 --> 01:31:01.488
From the divine father
came divine scorn.

01:31:03.859 --> 01:31:07.661
Thou rent from me free
companions [mumbles]

01:31:07.663 --> 01:31:10.597
nor was fortunes to be withheld.

01:31:12.167 --> 01:31:17.170
Thou let my lying wife
lie with [mumbles].

01:31:33.021 --> 01:31:38.091
Thou hath brought ruin
to my pure marriage.

01:31:39.895 --> 01:31:43.597
I shat upon thine own sacrament.

01:31:44.733 --> 01:31:49.536
I am glutted with loathing
of all that is divine!

01:31:57.613 --> 01:32:02.649
Thou forsook me, and I
forsake thee in return.

01:32:09.558 --> 01:32:14.628
Send forth thy four
apocalyptic horsemen.

01:32:19.568 --> 01:32:23.570
Ride me into the deep
for my blasphemy.

01:32:27.576 --> 01:32:32.646
[mumbles] wretched husband

01:32:35.217 --> 01:32:39.219
take her wretched soul. [sobs]

01:32:50.232 --> 01:32:55.068
I only wanted to be
close to you. [sobs]

01:33:14.656 --> 01:33:17.757
- He's expressing the
deep spiritual longing

01:33:17.759 --> 01:33:19.659
beneath his blasphemy.

01:33:29.071 --> 01:33:32.238
He reinterpreted the whole play.

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:35.609
Only by allowing himself
to rage at his God

01:33:35.611 --> 01:33:37.711
could Ulysses hope to reconnect

01:33:37.713 --> 01:33:41.147
with his authentic love for him.

01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:43.717
There is redemption after all.

01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:47.887
[audience applauds]

01:34:25.661 --> 01:34:28.028
[Rupert sobs]

01:34:41.843 --> 01:34:43.009
- Here we go.

01:34:44.746 --> 01:34:49.115
Oh, this one says, "Tamsin
Hollonby was convincing

01:34:49.117 --> 01:34:52.352
"as the abused wife, but
newcomer Rupert Lindsay's

01:34:52.354 --> 01:34:57.290
"tour de force performance
was the only real highlight

01:34:57.292 --> 01:34:59.192
"in an otherwise
dismal production."

01:34:59.194 --> 01:35:00.794
What?

01:35:00.796 --> 01:35:04.264
- Remember the early reviews
for Queen of the Commons?

01:35:04.266 --> 01:35:05.832
They called it a gay pantomime.

01:35:05.834 --> 01:35:08.268
It went on to make $42 million.

01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:10.103
- They've savaged it.

01:35:11.707 --> 01:35:14.774
- The trade of the critic in
music, literature and drama

01:35:14.776 --> 01:35:17.711
is the most degraded
of all trades.

01:35:17.713 --> 01:35:18.344
Mark Twain.

01:35:18.346 --> 01:35:19.813
- It gets worse.

01:35:19.815 --> 01:35:21.948
This was an impressive
diatribe by Rupert Lindsay

01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:24.984
but with no purpose
or consequence.

01:35:24.986 --> 01:35:27.087
If Christopher Marlowe
had a hand in this,

01:35:27.089 --> 01:35:28.722
which I very much doubt,

01:35:28.724 --> 01:35:33.026
then it was not a lost
Marlowe but a discarded one.

01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:36.196
- We're a limited company.

01:35:36.198 --> 01:35:38.732
They can't take our houses.

01:35:39.334 --> 01:35:41.301
Well, not yours anyway.

01:35:47.476 --> 01:35:48.476
- Hello.

01:35:51.012 --> 01:35:54.147
[knocking on window]

01:35:59.387 --> 01:36:02.222
- [Rupert] Do you have to go?

01:36:02.224 --> 01:36:07.093
- What you did at the barbecue
was really, really weird.

01:36:07.929 --> 01:36:09.028
- I know.

01:36:14.770 --> 01:36:17.036
I want you with my sexuality.

01:36:17.038 --> 01:36:19.806
I push you away with my anger,

01:36:22.210 --> 01:36:26.846
and me, stuck in the middle,

01:36:26.848 --> 01:36:31.117
trying to hold it all together
and failing miserably.

01:36:34.156 --> 01:36:36.089
- I'm sorry, Rupert.

01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:41.060
You're just too weird for me.

01:36:44.199 --> 01:36:45.298
Look, it's my fault.

01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:47.100
I should have known.

01:36:47.102 --> 01:36:51.204
I've been out with actors before,
and they're all a bit odd.

01:36:52.073 --> 01:36:54.941
I need someone to love, Rupert,

01:36:56.845 --> 01:36:59.312
and it's hard to love a method.

01:37:06.855 --> 01:37:07.855
Thank you.

01:37:17.165 --> 01:37:19.566
- I don't do fuckin' method.

01:37:19.568 --> 01:37:22.435
[dramatic music]
