1x06 Aunt Irma Visits

00:43.994 --> 00:45.468
I know you won a party!

00:45.734 --> 00:47.562
But I have to say thank you
to a few people

00:47.569 --> 00:49.900
after what has been
a momentous week for this company.

00:50.988 --> 00:54.105
Project Iccarus has increased
our productivity... 10 folds.

00:54.581 --> 00:57.783
Every department is working
at three times usual speed...

00:57.812 --> 00:59.898
due to the increased interconnectivity

00:59.980 --> 01:01.172
of our...

01:01.281 --> 01:03.216
computer system!

01:03.602 --> 01:05.107
Computers! Computers!

01:09.416 --> 01:12.145
How could I talk about
all that computer stuff,

01:12.252 --> 01:14.920
all... of that computer gobbledegook,

01:15.010 --> 01:17.692
without... saying a word about...

01:17.789 --> 01:18.846
the lawyers!

01:19.318 --> 01:20.608
They cut the red tape!

01:20.636 --> 01:22.888
They cut the red tape!
They cut the red tape!

01:22.954 --> 01:24.762
- Come on!
- Yes!

01:30.015 --> 01:31.716
That's enough!

01:31.802 --> 01:33.595
And when you're talking about computers,

01:33.681 --> 01:36.101
how can you fail to mention...

01:36.149 --> 01:37.432
Accounts!

01:38.954 --> 01:40.329
He's building up to us!

01:40.567 --> 01:41.728
He must be!

01:42.453 --> 01:44.466
And finally, last but not least...

01:44.705 --> 01:45.710
Champagne...

01:46.792 --> 01:50.013
These three people proved,
time and again,

01:50.505 --> 01:52.167
that they have...

01:52.168 --> 01:53.927
the right stuff!

01:55.292 --> 01:57.102
The toilet cleaners!

01:59.318 --> 02:00.787
They said we couldn't do it!

02:01.311 --> 02:03.229
They said outsourcing
our toilet cleaning

02:03.256 --> 02:04.535
would be inefficient!

02:04.677 --> 02:08.030
Derk, Banhead and Doodles
proved them wrong!

02:08.501 --> 02:09.622
Toilets!

02:09.717 --> 02:11.527
That's right Doodles!

02:15.583 --> 02:16.736
Where are you going?

02:17.103 --> 02:18.334
They do this every time.

02:18.835 --> 02:20.353
They never remember us!

02:20.822 --> 02:22.703
But... you did the work!

02:23.816 --> 02:25.774
You did all the work!

02:26.857 --> 02:29.652
So does this mean we're not going
to the "thank you" party?

02:29.666 --> 02:31.605
Of course we're not going
to the "thank you" party!

02:31.608 --> 02:32.211
Why would we go?

02:32.215 --> 02:33.352
We weren't thanked!

02:35.634 --> 02:36.744
Hello? I.T.,

02:36.753 --> 02:38.552
have you tried turning it off
and on again?

02:39.474 --> 02:41.649
Have you tried
sticking it up your arse?

02:45.292 --> 02:47.359
I just realised that was my mother.

02:48.363 --> 02:51.408
God! I was really looking forward
to that, you know.

02:51.632 --> 02:53.019
Fancy to dance.

02:53.205 --> 02:55.438
I'm glad the toilet guys
got the note, though.

02:55.659 --> 02:58.541
They do good work.
Have you been to the toilets on 12th?

02:58.774 --> 03:00.500
It's like going on holiday!

03:00.668 --> 03:02.149
I now try not to go at home, now.

03:02.260 --> 03:03.207
I save it up!

03:04.802 --> 03:08.016
Oh Jesus! Will you please
do something about that poster?

03:08.049 --> 03:09.075
What poster?

03:10.214 --> 03:11.219
Bloody drawer!

03:11.257 --> 03:13.592
That one! The one with the monkey!
It's horrible!

03:13.820 --> 03:15.597
The monkey?
What's wrong with that monkey?

03:15.673 --> 03:18.396
He's not horrible, he's lovely!
He's a lovely little monkey!

03:19.358 --> 03:20.904
What's he doing! A goal!

03:21.851 --> 03:23.378
Not that monkey!

03:23.671 --> 03:25.069
That monkey...

03:26.808 --> 03:28.537
Oh right. That is a bit frightening!

03:29.969 --> 03:31.929
Anyway! I'd better fix this drawer.

03:32.069 --> 03:34.024
Moss! Do you have the hammer?

03:34.557 --> 03:36.376
You're not listening to me!

03:36.427 --> 03:38.918
I hate it when people
don't listen to me!

03:39.370 --> 03:41.694
- Oh God!
- Hey, that much!

03:41.765 --> 03:43.081
Hyena screeching!

03:43.095 --> 03:44.975
It's like someone's killing a cat
in here!

03:45.025 --> 03:46.578
Some kind of shouty cat!

03:46.603 --> 03:47.980
- What's going on?
- God!

03:48.017 --> 03:49.419
Bring it down! Just bring it down.

03:49.454 --> 03:51.868
I'm so, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm just...

03:52.280 --> 03:53.497
I'm just a little bit...

03:53.623 --> 03:54.627
You know...

03:54.666 --> 03:56.242
- You know...
- What?

03:56.440 --> 03:58.297
- What?
- Well, I've got...

03:58.834 --> 04:01.140
- ...you know... at the moment so...
- What?

04:02.407 --> 04:04.932
I've got Aunt Irma visiting.

04:06.423 --> 04:08.342
I Do not like aunt Irma... I've got...

04:08.945 --> 04:10.604
I've got an aunt like that!

04:10.783 --> 04:12.290
It's my term for...

04:13.061 --> 04:15.027
my time of the month...

04:16.562 --> 04:18.204
What time of the month?
The week end?

04:18.406 --> 04:19.310
No.

04:19.327 --> 04:21.254
Does Aunt Irma visit on the week end?

04:21.290 --> 04:22.303
- Moss!
- You know, it...

04:22.319 --> 04:23.881
it's high tide...

04:24.053 --> 04:25.728
-  But we're not on the coast.
- Moss!

04:25.805 --> 04:27.794
I'm closed for maintenance.

04:27.863 --> 04:29.595
- Closed for maintenance?
- Moss!

04:29.672 --> 04:31.939
I've fallen to the Communists!

04:33.559 --> 04:35.568
Well, they do have
some strong arguments.

04:36.681 --> 04:39.978
"Carrie", Moss,
first scene in "Carrie".

04:51.350 --> 04:52.644
Yeah. You know, I...

04:52.903 --> 04:55.564
People tell me I'm not great
during this time, so...

04:55.597 --> 04:57.112
I felt I should warn you.

04:57.291 --> 04:58.672
Right. "Not great" what way?

04:58.796 --> 05:02.262
Just... I'm really...
not great to be around, so

05:02.457 --> 05:04.492
- try not to get on my nerves.
- Oh yeah.

05:04.516 --> 05:07.226
Hey, I've had a few girlfriends.
I'm not completely oblivious!

05:07.319 --> 05:09.351
- You won't even know I'm here.
- Okay.

05:11.571 --> 05:14.896
Oh! This is working right...
The afternoon is so great!

05:15.104 --> 05:17.528
Look at that! So smooth!

05:17.605 --> 05:19.119
Stop doing that!

05:20.045 --> 05:21.051
Oh my God!

05:21.122 --> 05:23.433
Sorry! Sorry, but you see what I mean!

05:23.453 --> 05:24.623
You have to be careful.

05:24.721 --> 05:25.910
Yeah! I'll be careful!

05:27.982 --> 05:29.855
- Has she gone yet?
- Yeah.

05:30.448 --> 05:31.919
What  was all that about?

05:32.169 --> 05:34.180
Goddamme! Ladies!

05:34.449 --> 05:37.453
God bless them!
What would we do without though?

05:37.609 --> 05:39.314
With their ways...

05:39.516 --> 05:42.057
Their mysterious seasons!

05:42.523 --> 05:43.503
The moon!

05:43.873 --> 05:45.985
Glenn Close! Sheila Riston!

05:46.012 --> 05:48.811
All the different kinds of women.

05:49.296 --> 05:50.375
Smashing!

05:52.224 --> 05:54.901
Oh my appointment.
I've got to go and see the psychiatrist.

05:54.956 --> 05:57.445
I can't believe there's a psychiatrist
in the building.

05:57.517 --> 05:59.239
All because those two from accounts

05:59.258 --> 06:02.198
just had enough of everything
and wanted to go to the seaside.

06:02.261 --> 06:03.340
The seaside?

06:03.518 --> 06:05.254
They committed suicide, Roy!

06:08.102 --> 06:10.021
That's right! Yes, of course.

06:10.149 --> 06:11.722
Why do you have to go and see her?

06:12.194 --> 06:13.896
Because I said Jen was dead, that time.

06:13.975 --> 06:15.812
Oh yeah. Yeah. That'll be it.

06:15.915 --> 06:20.231
She said it was something only
a severely disturbed person would do.

06:20.482 --> 06:23.314
And that now, I have to spend
a lot of time in therapy.

06:23.522 --> 06:24.513
Isn't that great?

06:24.681 --> 06:26.859
Oh well, yes, that's...
That's clearly terrific.

06:26.953 --> 06:28.019
No! No, that's bad!

06:28.082 --> 06:29.696
Why do you think that's great?

06:29.755 --> 06:33.480
The psychiatrist is a very...
attractive lady?

06:33.789 --> 06:38.296
- I see... She's of the female...
- Genre? Yes.

06:38.351 --> 06:40.796
A Dr. Melfi to your Tony Soprano?

06:40.841 --> 06:42.866
She's a glamorous old woman.

06:42.892 --> 06:45.307
Oh, the things you could learn
from her...

06:45.386 --> 06:46.665
Or from any woman.

06:48.438 --> 06:49.392
Is Jen is her office?

06:49.404 --> 06:51.422
- I need to get her to sign something.
- Yeah.

06:53.042 --> 06:54.490
Don't get on her nerves.

06:54.762 --> 06:56.304
How would I get on her nerves?

07:06.452 --> 07:07.522
Hello!

07:18.061 --> 07:20.092
Shouldn't I be on the couch?

07:20.755 --> 07:22.329
No, Maurice. Not today.

07:22.778 --> 07:24.198
I've got some good news.

07:24.414 --> 07:25.783
I think you've downed the corner.

07:26.073 --> 07:27.433
I'm not going on the couch?

07:27.794 --> 07:29.471
You don't need me any more, Moss.

07:29.592 --> 07:30.462
What?

07:30.533 --> 07:32.564
Well, there's obviously
nothing wrong with you.

07:32.769 --> 07:35.522
And I think you're ready now
to do without our sessions.

07:39.052 --> 07:40.890
But I've been feeling depressed!

07:41.844 --> 07:43.777
Oh really? Why?

07:47.470 --> 07:49.001
Because I'm pregnant.

07:49.734 --> 07:50.662
What?

07:50.739 --> 07:53.455
I mean...
I had a dream that I was pregnant.

07:55.372 --> 07:56.376
Well...

07:56.553 --> 07:58.574
There's nothing unusual about that.

07:58.721 --> 08:00.160
But when I have the baby,

08:00.215 --> 08:02.858
I looked down
and saw that it was my father!

08:06.524 --> 08:08.901
- That's normal, Moss.
- Really?

08:09.012 --> 08:10.880
That's the maddest thing
I could think of!

08:11.556 --> 08:13.602
My mother? What if it had two heads?

08:14.150 --> 08:15.997
Moss!  Listen, I think you're fine

08:16.033 --> 08:18.520
and there are other people here
who need me more.

08:18.634 --> 08:19.561
But...

08:19.619 --> 08:21.479
I've been having dark thoughts.

08:22.814 --> 08:23.926
Dark thoughts?

08:24.064 --> 08:26.566
Yes. Thoughts about dark things...

08:26.954 --> 08:28.598
What sort of dark things?

08:28.881 --> 08:30.497
Things that are dark...

08:32.143 --> 08:33.220
Like what?

08:33.759 --> 08:36.331
Darkness... night...

08:37.029 --> 08:38.517
Things of the night...

08:40.065 --> 08:41.116
Dracula...

08:43.341 --> 08:45.783
You haven't been thinking
about self-harm?

08:45.854 --> 08:47.686
Self-harm, yes! Harm!

08:48.946 --> 08:50.042
Harm with the self.

08:51.780 --> 08:52.895
Suicide...

08:52.969 --> 08:54.718
For starters, yes.

08:55.958 --> 08:56.982
Moss,

08:57.098 --> 08:59.940
I do not think that you are suicidal.

09:00.399 --> 09:02.067
Why? Why not? I tell you,

09:02.126 --> 09:03.795
I'm at the end of my flipping tether!

09:03.853 --> 09:07.488
Moss! It's not like you
to use that sort of language!

09:07.556 --> 09:09.033
- Flip off!
- Moss!

09:31.177 --> 09:33.317
For God's sake!

09:36.051 --> 09:38.263
- Yes!
- Roy!

09:38.380 --> 09:40.550
Sorry Roy! I may be speaking louder
at the moment

09:40.571 --> 09:42.501
because I'm wearing ear-plugs.

09:43.608 --> 09:45.262
Why are you wearing ear-plugs?

09:45.305 --> 09:46.341
That's right!

09:48.420 --> 09:50.135
- What?
- What's this contraption?

09:52.553 --> 09:55.998
I'm... I'm stealing food
from this machine.

09:57.267 --> 09:58.888
- Yeah!
- You know I do!

10:00.449 --> 10:03.328
Oh, by the way, Roy, your work
on Project Iccarus was very good.

10:03.355 --> 10:05.193
Well done, you did a great job! Thanks!

10:05.903 --> 10:07.502
Yep? I can't hear you!

10:23.138 --> 10:24.671
What's wrong with you?

10:25.220 --> 10:26.601
Oh my God, you're crying?

10:26.615 --> 10:28.128
I'm not crying! You're crying!

10:28.435 --> 10:30.480
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong!

10:30.485 --> 10:33.114
I'm fine! Will you stop getting at me?
You're always getting at me!

10:33.153 --> 10:36.090
I'm not getting at you!
Stop shouting at me!

10:36.441 --> 10:39.031
Why are these things
always so hard to open?!

10:40.600 --> 10:42.340
Oh my God!

10:42.978 --> 10:45.516
Wow, calm down, everybody!

10:47.898 --> 10:50.247
What on Earth is going on?!

10:50.369 --> 10:52.003
I don't know, I feel weird.

10:52.093 --> 10:54.968
I've... I've been swearing
like a flipping docker!

10:56.862 --> 10:59.005
Denholm's just thanked me
for Project Iccarus

10:59.035 --> 11:01.140
and I started crying like an actress!

11:01.514 --> 11:02.723
What's going on?!

11:03.011 --> 11:06.363
Maybe it's all this stuff
that you both eat.

11:06.420 --> 11:08.725
- Oh will you get off that?
- No, honestly, it's true!

11:08.764 --> 11:11.069
Okay, Moss, what did you have
for breakfast this morning?

11:11.127 --> 11:13.118
- Smarties cereals.
- Oh my God!

11:13.480 --> 11:16.440
I  didn't even know
Smarties made a cereal.

11:16.562 --> 11:18.874
They don't.
It's just Smarties in a bowl with milk.

11:20.814 --> 11:22.137
Case closed!

11:22.176 --> 11:24.328
It's too much sugar, that's all!

11:24.497 --> 11:25.982
No no! Hold on now!

11:25.992 --> 11:27.750
I basically live on sugar

11:27.808 --> 11:29.971
and we've never had
these problems before.

11:31.031 --> 11:33.236
The only other explanation is...

11:34.715 --> 11:36.009
No,  no. It's silly.

11:36.161 --> 11:37.165
What?

11:37.880 --> 11:38.891
Well...

11:39.599 --> 11:42.236
I feel ridiculous even saying it but...

11:42.758 --> 11:44.025
Where I worked before,

11:44.064 --> 11:46.979
there was me and a few other girls,
Liz and Susan and

11:47.045 --> 11:49.865
whenever Aunt Irma was visiting me,

11:50.737 --> 11:52.112
we all kind of...

11:53.616 --> 11:54.882
synchronized.

11:56.058 --> 11:57.523
What's that got to do with us?

11:58.274 --> 11:59.201
Well...

11:59.259 --> 12:00.836
- You think...
- Well maybe...

12:00.858 --> 12:02.959
- You're not saying...
- I know it sounds crazy.

12:02.998 --> 12:05.742
Wow! You don't think
that Aunt Irma is visiting us?

12:06.502 --> 12:08.029
The symptoms, Roy!

12:08.067 --> 12:10.251
I am a man! He's a man! We're men!

12:10.289 --> 12:13.137
Okay, okay! Tell me how you're feeling?

12:15.561 --> 12:16.759
I feel delicate.

12:21.017 --> 12:23.039
And... annoyed...

12:23.834 --> 12:25.096
And...

12:26.170 --> 12:27.468
I think I'm ugly.

12:29.861 --> 12:31.477
That's her!

12:31.564 --> 12:32.737
This is ridiculous!

12:32.776 --> 12:34.926
I've never heard anything so...

12:34.971 --> 12:36.247
bizarre in my life!

12:36.285 --> 12:38.572
Oh stop shouting at her!
You're always shouting at her

12:38.592 --> 12:40.285
and it's not fair! It's not fair!

12:52.388 --> 12:54.656
You don't believe this theory, do you?

12:54.742 --> 12:56.401
- No!
- No.

12:56.802 --> 12:59.275
- It's non sense, isn't it?
- She's so silly!

12:59.634 --> 13:01.346
- Sugar!
- Yeah...

13:03.051 --> 13:04.181
What?

13:04.239 --> 13:05.746
That's not what's causing it.

13:05.842 --> 13:07.135
You think it's Irma?

13:07.481 --> 13:08.641
Yes. Don't you?

13:08.718 --> 13:09.792
No!

13:10.640 --> 13:12.325
I'm a man! We're men!

13:12.476 --> 13:13.297
Well, if it's true,

13:13.336 --> 13:15.389
it's the scientific breakthrough
of the afternoon.

13:16.521 --> 13:17.680
It's not true!

13:17.728 --> 13:19.418
Don't worry,
I wasn't about to look foolish

13:19.446 --> 13:21.633
by jumping to conclusions,
so I've sent an e-mail out

13:21.654 --> 13:22.999
asking everyone's opinions.

13:23.847 --> 13:25.478
Right. Well, that's a good idea.

13:26.460 --> 13:28.395
No, sorry.
Could you run that part to me again?

13:29.138 --> 13:30.906
I've sent it to everyone
in my address book.

13:30.964 --> 13:32.046
You should have one.

13:32.294 --> 13:33.286
What?

13:34.341 --> 13:36.525
Do we have PMT?

13:37.465 --> 13:39.055
You sent this out?!

13:39.116 --> 13:40.539
Oh you signed it from both of us!

13:40.574 --> 13:42.188
You signed it from both of us!

13:43.802 --> 13:46.025
Yes. Along with a list of symptoms.

13:46.157 --> 13:47.990
"Headachy", "Weakened",

13:48.002 --> 13:49.854
"Irritability, anxiety!"

13:50.335 --> 13:51.765
"Breast tenderness!"

13:51.892 --> 13:53.343
I get that, don't you?

13:53.434 --> 13:54.337
Yes!

13:54.367 --> 13:57.060
But you cannot tell
the entire I.T. community

13:57.081 --> 13:58.511
that we have PMT!

13:58.768 --> 14:01.321
Come on! No one would use
that sort of information against us.

14:01.333 --> 14:03.599
Now, wait a second!
They would, wouldn't they? Oh no!

14:05.048 --> 14:07.903
There's probably a whole website
devoted to us already!

14:07.920 --> 14:09.729
Oh I only posted it about an hour ago.

14:09.746 --> 14:10.958
Google our names!

14:11.760 --> 14:12.810
Oh no!

14:16.460 --> 14:17.743
What do we gotta do?

14:17.814 --> 14:19.019
I don't know!

14:19.714 --> 14:22.163
Come on! It's my turn with the bottle.

14:31.481 --> 14:34.143
God, sorry Richmond, sorry.
I always forget you work here.

14:35.169 --> 14:38.034
Yeah. I seldom normally come out
this far, only

14:38.166 --> 14:39.961
could you have a word with Moss and Roy?

14:40.222 --> 14:43.008
Ever since they got famous,
they've been at each other's throats.

14:43.198 --> 14:46.100
- Famous?
- Yes. Google their names.

14:49.665 --> 14:52.171
Oh my God!
How many entries do they have?

14:52.320 --> 14:53.478
Thousands...

14:53.627 --> 14:56.123
Mosse's e-mail's spreading
like a virus!

14:56.329 --> 14:59.065
You've unleashed a monster
with that aunt Irma business.

14:59.154 --> 15:03.641
Yes Richmond. Tell me,
how come Aunt Irma isn't affecting you?

15:04.010 --> 15:06.674
Of course it is!
I've been feeling very gloomy all day!

15:08.189 --> 15:10.754
Not my usual cheery self at all!

15:10.871 --> 15:12.604
Yeah. I guess it's
just difficult to tell

15:12.605 --> 15:13.800
underneath all that make-up.

15:14.689 --> 15:16.055
I'm not wearing make-up!

15:17.940 --> 15:19.099
Could you have a word?

15:19.118 --> 15:21.618
They're driving me out
of my tiny little mind.

15:26.463 --> 15:28.147
Guys! You gonna have to...

15:28.186 --> 15:30.323
Oh my goodness!
What happened to your face?

15:31.549 --> 15:33.182
We had an argument.

15:37.676 --> 15:39.993
Oh God, have you seen this?
What's happening?

15:40.054 --> 15:41.878
<i>The rioting has been going</i>

15:41.879 --> 15:43.183
<i>on all night.</i>

15:43.279 --> 15:46.158
<i>The men involved are young, angry and</i>

15:46.173 --> 15:48.916
<i>almost all of them work with computers.</i>

15:50.433 --> 15:52.911
This is insane! What's going on?!

15:52.975 --> 15:55.641
<i>In Tokyo, two games designers</i>

15:55.660 --> 15:58.184
<i>went on the rampage in a shopping centre</i>

15:58.197 --> 16:00.004
<i>and frightened a dog!</i>

16:00.479 --> 16:03.465
<i>In Hamburg, a group
of software developers</i>

16:03.491 --> 16:05.100
<i>shouted at a bus.</i>

16:05.712 --> 16:08.698
<i>The situation is completely
out of cont...</i>

16:09.021 --> 16:11.092
And it's all because of Aunt Irma.

16:11.162 --> 16:12.200
But how?

16:12.351 --> 16:15.473
You shouldn't have sent out this e-mail
detailing the symptoms.

16:15.540 --> 16:18.550
You know how suggestible
and easily swayed I.T. people are...

16:18.604 --> 16:20.425
- That's not true!
- Yes it is!

16:20.501 --> 16:21.896
No you're right. Of course it is.

16:22.790 --> 16:24.484
You shouldn't have sent that e-mail,
Moss!

16:24.527 --> 16:25.511
Oh don't blame me!

16:25.777 --> 16:27.613
- It's your fault!
- Guys!

16:27.784 --> 16:29.661
Guys, come on! You're fighting!

16:29.694 --> 16:31.342
It's like you're in a trance!

16:31.375 --> 16:33.139
No, you're right!
We shouldn't be doing this!

16:33.148 --> 16:34.733
This is enough! We never fight!

16:35.366 --> 16:36.684
We have to do something.

16:36.961 --> 16:37.962
Yeah, whatever.

16:41.465 --> 16:42.547
I'm going in.

16:42.629 --> 16:45.031
Damn it Roy! I never thought
it would come to this!

16:45.115 --> 16:46.539
The hell it has!

16:46.582 --> 16:49.102
She's the only one that's had
direct contact with Irma.

16:49.305 --> 16:50.986
If we can just calm her down then...

16:51.461 --> 16:54.089
We can hope and pray
that everybody else calms down too.

16:54.818 --> 16:56.311
You've got big balls, Roy!

16:59.906 --> 17:00.967
Thanks.

17:02.196 --> 17:03.303
You're very welcome.

17:07.030 --> 17:07.925
Hiya!

17:08.103 --> 17:10.632
Can't even find a bloody pen in here!

17:11.506 --> 17:13.008
How is my soldier?

17:13.227 --> 17:14.361
What do you want?!

17:14.415 --> 17:16.227
I just came in for a little chat.

17:17.194 --> 17:18.743
You  are looking good today!

17:18.824 --> 17:20.771
- Ah, thank you.
- So slim!

17:21.002 --> 17:22.853
Yeah, I'm trying to stay in shape,
you know...

17:22.931 --> 17:24.700
Oh your hair looks great!

17:24.767 --> 17:26.039
Yeah. Hair conditioner.

17:27.146 --> 17:28.955
The action on this is great!

17:32.590 --> 17:33.575
Hello!

17:34.296 --> 17:35.463
Hello Maurice.

17:36.040 --> 17:38.377
I have to tell you
I've a little confession to make.

17:38.819 --> 17:41.447
As you may or may not know,
for ethical reasons,

17:41.489 --> 17:43.218
I'm required not to have any...

17:43.383 --> 17:45.955
relations with any of my patients.

17:49.929 --> 17:51.572
But for the last few months,

17:52.189 --> 17:54.131
I've been developing some

17:55.101 --> 17:56.183
warm...

17:56.293 --> 17:58.022
feelings towards you.

17:58.600 --> 18:01.488
And the real reason
I terminated your therapy

18:02.213 --> 18:04.246
was so that I could explore...

18:05.117 --> 18:06.900
some of these feelings...

18:11.320 --> 18:12.535
I see...

18:15.884 --> 18:16.861
Jen,

18:17.193 --> 18:18.727
I was just wondering,

18:19.267 --> 18:21.875
when you were working
in your old job, with the girls,

18:21.989 --> 18:24.343
if things ever got on top of you,

18:24.718 --> 18:26.979
what would you do to...

18:28.880 --> 18:30.327
relax?

18:31.741 --> 18:33.545
We'd have a big girls' night out.

18:34.601 --> 18:36.053
I'd love that actually.

18:36.733 --> 18:38.645
A big girly night out!

18:39.375 --> 18:41.185
There aren't chances of that round here.

18:41.400 --> 18:42.540
Not necessarily.

18:48.173 --> 18:49.178
Mom?!

18:55.442 --> 18:57.238
This is my psychiatrist.

18:57.248 --> 18:59.124
Oh! No. No, I'm... I'm sorry.

18:59.142 --> 19:00.443
It's just that you...

19:00.485 --> 19:03.338
You look exactly like my mother.

19:03.687 --> 19:05.986
No, no! But that... that...
don't be offended by that.

19:06.025 --> 19:08.529
She's... she's a very sexy woman.

19:09.547 --> 19:12.865
Not not... not that I would want
to have sex with her...

19:14.282 --> 19:16.787
I know that that's what
you psychiatrists think!

19:17.017 --> 19:20.946
But I swear to God
that there's nothing to it in my case!

19:21.875 --> 19:26.238
You know my mother wouldn't stand
for any of that kind of nonsense!

19:27.465 --> 19:29.343
I can just hear her now...

19:30.081 --> 19:31.611
"What are you doing Roy?"

19:31.911 --> 19:33.257
"What are you doing?!"

19:37.211 --> 19:38.741
You handled that well!

19:39.977 --> 19:41.864
That's the psychiatrist!

19:42.064 --> 19:43.165
Yes, I...

19:43.204 --> 19:45.169
I think she's my girlfriend now.

19:45.912 --> 19:47.517
No, Moss! Listen to me.

19:47.536 --> 19:49.320
You can never see that woman again.

19:49.334 --> 19:51.080
She looks exactly like my mother.

19:51.104 --> 19:52.605
Oh stop it. You're exaggerating.

19:52.640 --> 19:53.896
She's the spit of her!

19:53.983 --> 19:55.684
Oh come on. What went on in there?

19:56.116 --> 19:57.547
All right. Okay.

19:58.556 --> 20:00.085
What would you say...

20:00.220 --> 20:02.111
to a big girls' night out?

20:03.889 --> 20:05.174
How big are the girls?

20:18.577 --> 20:22.008
I can't believe I'd never seen
"Steel Magnolias"!

20:23.752 --> 20:25.240
Oh my God! It's good, isn't it?

20:27.052 --> 20:29.485
- I know what we could watch next!
- Yeah!

20:29.945 --> 20:32.723
- Your really liked that film?
- Yes. Didn't you?

20:32.789 --> 20:34.968
No! It was heart-warming!

20:35.134 --> 20:37.070
Well I feel like a princess, Roy!

20:37.098 --> 20:39.152
And don't tell me
you don't feel the same!

20:41.649 --> 20:43.394
Well, my breast-tenderness has gone.

20:44.822 --> 20:47.255
No! What am I talking about?!
I'm a man! We're men!

20:47.330 --> 20:48.644
It's the worst night of my life!

20:48.702 --> 20:49.990
Hiya!

20:50.125 --> 20:51.127
Okay!

20:51.877 --> 20:55.116
Beaches... or... Dirty Dancing!

20:55.163 --> 20:57.307
Oh, Beaches! No! Dirty Dancing!

20:57.351 --> 20:58.896
- Oh I can't decide!
- Do!

20:58.922 --> 21:00.458
God! Dear God!

21:00.477 --> 21:02.317
I don't know which one to watch either!

21:03.306 --> 21:05.018
Oh hey! But you know what we should do?

21:05.043 --> 21:07.118
- What?
- Something else!

21:08.189 --> 21:09.450
Oh! I know!

21:09.504 --> 21:12.053
Why don't we go to the thank you party?

21:12.069 --> 21:13.712
But I thought you didn't want to go.

21:14.048 --> 21:15.284
Well, you know...

21:15.701 --> 21:17.796
Everybody else is there,
and they did nothing

21:17.852 --> 21:20.082
- and we did all the work!
- Yeah...

21:20.225 --> 21:22.682
- Screw them!
- Yeah! Screw them!

21:23.373 --> 21:25.440
- Ok, come on! Let's go girls!
- Yeah!

21:26.065 --> 21:27.077
Ok but first,

21:27.095 --> 21:28.468
10 minutes of Beaches!

21:39.480 --> 21:42.319
<i>www.ladiesproblem.com</i>

22:07.071 --> 22:08.271
Oh Lord!

22:10.100 --> 22:13.604
Oh yes, I suggest
I ask Dr. Mendall to join us.

22:13.943 --> 22:14.926
What?

22:15.003 --> 22:16.888
Moss! Over here!

22:22.394 --> 22:23.603
What shall we do?

22:26.076 --> 22:27.080
Nothing...

22:27.378 --> 22:29.272
I just... I really need to get drunk.

22:29.349 --> 22:31.363
Yeah, I'd like to get drunk.

22:33.795 --> 22:36.210
- We should get drunk together then.
- Okay, yeah.

22:37.911 --> 22:40.975
We should get so drunk
that we don't know what's going on.

22:42.232 --> 22:43.272
All right.

22:48.469 --> 22:52.874
...and, turned out,
4 dead cyclists on my fault!

22:54.222 --> 22:55.675
Brilliant! Same thing I...

22:55.733 --> 22:57.665
I.T. guys! Can we?!

23:37.829 --> 23:39.057
Oh dear.

23:47.203 --> 23:49.830
Oh my God! I didn't!

23:50.854 --> 23:52.614
I didn't!

23:55.546 --> 23:56.976
Good morning!

24:05.949 --> 24:07.661
I've made you a cup of tea.

24:08.281 --> 24:09.584
Ah, thanks mom.

24:09.984 --> 24:10.954
Mom?

24:11.543 --> 24:13.010
That's interesting!
