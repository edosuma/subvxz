00:04.270 --> 00:05.419
Francis (distorted):
Nobody approaches us.

00:05.430 --> 00:07.125
The house is rigged to explode.

00:07.140 --> 00:10.029
Any trespass results
in detonation.

00:10.040 --> 00:11.462
I just checked on him.

00:11.470 --> 00:12.835
Woman:
Then Check on him again.

00:12.840 --> 00:14.159
I'm real sick.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.875
I know.

00:15.880 --> 00:18.178
Widener: This is coming to
an end; it's gonna be over soon.

00:18.180 --> 00:19.499
You need to think about
what's going to happen next.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.215
I thought that was you
going to jail.

00:21.220 --> 00:23.541
You need to listen
to your lawyer's adVIce, meg.

00:23.550 --> 00:26.280
Take the fifth. We can help each
other or we can hurt each other.

00:26.290 --> 00:28.110
I just want my daughter back.

00:28.120 --> 00:29.781
No I.D. On him?
Finley: No, sir.

00:29.790 --> 00:31.655
We're looking for a white male,
nicknamed buddy.

00:31.660 --> 00:33.878
Olsen:
Get with security
and have them run

00:33.900 --> 00:35.629
E very man here
through that filter.

00:35.630 --> 00:36.699
Finley, right there.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.793
Kyle, I'm sick.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.028
You can have him now.

00:42.870 --> 00:45.703
(machines beeping)

00:45.710 --> 00:47.200
Man:
Who ’5 here from transport?

00:48.010 --> 00:49.637
That'd be me.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.709
Francis: You can have five kids
right now.

00:51.710 --> 00:53.575
We only need one thing from you:

00:53.580 --> 00:56.378
Secret service agent
marcus finley.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.448
He's here.

01:09.860 --> 01:13.398
(indistinct radio transmission)

01:15.600 --> 01:18.034
The minefield will
have a kill switch.

01:18.040 --> 01:20.929
If you stay alive long enough
to do anything, get to that.

01:20.940 --> 01:23.500
Good luck, sir.

01:24.550 --> 01:25.847
When do we see the kids?

01:25.850 --> 01:28.717
When finley is 25 yards
from the house,

01:28.720 --> 01:30.210
(distorted):
We will send them.

01:30.220 --> 01:33.212
Olsen :1
Come on, g/hson.

01:33.220 --> 01:34.687
What are you doing?

01:36.930 --> 01:40.752
Koz:
Stop there, please.

01:42.930 --> 01:44.898
Send the kids. I'm here.

01:44.900 --> 01:46.094
Send the kids now.

01:46.100 --> 01:48.898
Olsen:
Who has eyes on that door?

01:48.900 --> 01:50.299
I want_to see in there
right now.

01:50.310 --> 01:51.368
This is assault 3.

01:51.370 --> 01:52.701
You have the image.

01:52.710 --> 01:54.268
Dunn:
7'here.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.804
That's gibson there
with the hostages.

01:55.810 --> 01:57.277
He's not the one
doing the talking.

01:58.480 --> 02:01.813
Koz:
Please advance towards the door.

02:04.490 --> 02:06.617
When do the kids start walking?

02:06.620 --> 02:09.316
Send them. Send them now.

02:11.830 --> 02:14.492
Just keep going.
Don't look back.

02:16.460 --> 02:19.463
Thank you.

02:19.470 --> 02:22.564
Wayne carter, mao’ison a/va,
ryan carson,

02:22.570 --> 02:24.731
Zoe richmond, ty harper.

02:24.740 --> 02:27.664
Five, as promised, but not
the one you're looking for.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.272
Not the president's son,
because today

02:29.280 --> 02:30.975
We have a message
for president devore.

02:30.980 --> 02:34.143
Turn around,
put your hands on your head.

02:34.150 --> 02:36.744
Mr. President,
how far will you go,

02:36.750 --> 02:39.742
What would you do
for your child?

02:39.760 --> 02:42.809
These are our demands
if you call off the fbi:

02:42.830 --> 02:44.752
A plane to the country
of our choosing,

02:44.760 --> 02:47.854
Presidential pardons for all
of us, including the parents

02:47.860 --> 02:50.249
Of the children
that have committed crimes.

02:50.270 --> 02:53.694
You do this in the next three
hours, and your son comes home.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.876
Refuse, mr. President...

03:04.780 --> 03:06.873
...Or fail...

03:09.780 --> 03:12.044
...And your son dies.

03:23.300 --> 03:25.325
I have no idea
what this is.

03:25.330 --> 03:28.663
What did they do
to him in there?

03:28.670 --> 03:30.365
Devore: It's better
if I don't come out there.

03:30.370 --> 03:31.803
I understand.

03:31.810 --> 03:33.129
Whatever you decide,
you'll have my support.

03:33.140 --> 03:34.334
Of course.

03:34.340 --> 03:35.876
Devo re :
I’// be monitoring

03:35.880 --> 03:37.177
The situation from here.

03:37.180 --> 03:38.977
I understand, mr. President.

03:41.480 --> 03:42.947
Hey, hey.

03:45.150 --> 03:46.412
They are surrounded.

03:46.420 --> 03:48.650
We will get them out.

03:48.660 --> 03:51.379
We will use everything.

03:51.390 --> 03:53.381
It won't be enough.

03:55.030 --> 03:58.397
They took those kids.
They've done what they wanted.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.265
They killed that boy.

04:00.270 --> 04:01.737
They're gonna kill ours.

04:01.740 --> 04:04.265
You know I can't do it.

04:04.270 --> 04:06.909
You're the most
powerful man in the world.

04:06.910 --> 04:10.107
Give them what
they want, please.

04:10.110 --> 04:12.578
I can't.

04:12.580 --> 04:16.209
What does any of this
matter if kyle is dead?

04:16.220 --> 04:18.916
I can't negotiate
with kidnappers!

04:22.520 --> 04:24.488
(sobs)

04:38.770 --> 04:40.704
(groans)

04:42.240 --> 04:44.606
(finley panting)

04:50.450 --> 04:53.112
Hey, secret service.

04:53.120 --> 04:54.542
You remember me?

04:54.560 --> 04:56.983
Yeah.

04:56.990 --> 04:58.457
How you doing?

04:58.460 --> 05:01.327
Better than you.

05:04.270 --> 05:05.999
Take him to the hole.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.922
It's almost over.

05:07.940 --> 05:09.737
The world knows
where you guys are.

05:09.740 --> 05:11.298
We'll get you home!

05:11.310 --> 05:13.767
And take him back to
the kitchen; it's question time.

05:13.780 --> 05:15.509
No! No, no, no!
Please, please!

05:15.510 --> 05:16.977
No, no, no, please, no!

05:16.980 --> 05:19.005
No, stop, no more!
Hey, hey, hey, hey,

05:19.010 --> 05:20.841
He said they're
gonna save us, okay?

05:20.850 --> 05:23.273
They're right outside.
They're right outside.

05:23.290 --> 05:25.485
Shh, shh, shh.
We're gonna be okay.

05:25.490 --> 05:27.879
He's gonna be okay.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.258
If the house is rigged
to explode

05:31.260 --> 05:32.989
And the kidnappers
are ready to die,

05:33.000 --> 05:35.298
We can't breach without
major loss of hostage life.

05:35.300 --> 05:37.325
That wasn't gibson
we were just talking to.

05:37.330 --> 05:40.026
No, it wasn't, but that doesn't
mean that he's not in control.

05:40.040 --> 05:43.339
Whoever was in control
back there IS usmg two parents:

05:43.340 --> 05:45.001
The president
and a white supremacist.

05:45.010 --> 05:47.103
I want to know
what they have In common.

05:47.110 --> 05:49.772
So exactly where is our aryan
brother, mr. Delman birch, now?

05:49.780 --> 05:51.509
Man: We don't
have him, Sir.

05:51.510 --> 05:53.273
What?
No, I I.D.'d him

05:53.280 --> 05:54.975
At _that work station
right over there.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.538
That wasn't delman birch.

05:56.550 --> 05:59.280
That was landon green,
a 20-year fbi agent.

05:59.290 --> 06:01.815
Someone got into our system
and switched their I.D.S, sir.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.118
We're increasing
our cyber security,

06:04.130 --> 06:05.950
But this is
delman "buddy" birch.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.985
And, sir, he's been here.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.888
In the icc?

06:09.900 --> 06:12.289
This is the
surveillance footage.

06:12.300 --> 06:14.325
Once we got the correct I.D.,
we use facial recognition,

06:14.340 --> 06:16.331
And, well,
I've isolated it for you.

06:16.340 --> 06:18.501
That's delman "buddy" birch.

06:18.510 --> 06:19.829
What's he holding?

06:19.840 --> 06:21.876
That looks like
a container, Sir.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.472
Full of the sick
boy's blood.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.846
Okay, I've got the president
about to lose his kid,

06:25.850 --> 06:29.217
And I've got a neo-nazi
with a cooler full of blood

06:29.220 --> 06:30.710
And half a brick of c-4.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.415
You find buddy
and you find out

06:32.420 --> 06:34.217
What the hell he's up to.
Yes, sir.

06:34.220 --> 06:36.359
Sir, what about finley?

06:36.360 --> 06:40.387
For now,
he's on his own.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.664
(grunting)

06:58.550 --> 07:00.745
Gibson...

07:00.750 --> 07:02.877
I know what widener did
to your daughter.

07:02.890 --> 07:05.450
I know he threatened
to kill beth ann.

07:05.450 --> 07:08.351
Jonas, I'm assuming
you told agent finley

07:08.360 --> 07:12.126
That widener had threatened
the life of my daughter.

07:12.130 --> 07:13.757
Francis...
It's okay.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.523
It's the truth.

07:15.530 --> 07:19.421
You want to keep her safe,
this is not the place for her.

07:19.440 --> 07:22.193
End this! We can keep her safe.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.930
Open a secure line.

07:32.150 --> 07:33.708
Can you hear me?

07:33.720 --> 07:35.244
Copy.

07:35.250 --> 07:36.774
We're gonna be making
some calls.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.382
Copy that.

07:39.490 --> 07:40.809
Agent dunn.
Yeah?

07:40.820 --> 07:42.253
National guard
found the medevac van

07:42.260 --> 07:43.659
Delman birch left
here in, abandoned.

07:43.660 --> 07:44.979
He switched cars.

07:44.990 --> 07:46.480
What surveillance
do we have in that area?

07:46.500 --> 07:48.252
None. It's outside
the search grid.

07:48.260 --> 07:50.091
We have a bolo out
for him now.

07:50.100 --> 07:52.728
Go.

07:52.730 --> 07:55.233
He's on a mission for gibson.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.834
Every attack has been
against the cia.

07:57.840 --> 08:00.604
You, can you get me the senate
hearings schedule for today?

08:00.610 --> 08:01.907
When is widener there?

08:01.910 --> 08:04.333
One moment, ma'am.

08:05.810 --> 08:08.278
Director widener was there
all day yesterday,

08:08.280 --> 08:10.316
He'll be there all day today.
Anything else you need?

08:10.320 --> 08:11.810
No.

08:17.590 --> 08:20.150
Reporter: Demand was issued by
the ballard kidnappers

08:20.160 --> 08:21.752
To the president
of the United States today.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.455
With the fbi just outside
of where the kidnappers

08:23.470 --> 08:25.324
Are holding those hostages,
(phone ringing)

08:25.330 --> 08:28.595
It seems that...
(engine stops)

08:29.470 --> 08:31.438
Been listening to the news.

08:31.440 --> 08:34.136
You got me and the US.
President working for you today.

08:34.140 --> 08:37.029
You just worry about
what you need to do.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.472
You just think about your son.

08:38.480 --> 08:41.608
(distorted):
Did you do as I instructed?

08:41.620 --> 08:44.646
I have the blood,
bought the suit and the c-4.

08:44.650 --> 08:46.345
Are you where you need to be?

08:47.890 --> 08:49.016
Right out front.

08:49.020 --> 08:50.885
I do this, I get my son, right?

08:50.890 --> 08:52.687
Yes.

08:52.690 --> 08:54.851
What happened to your kid?

08:57.000 --> 08:58.627
Something must have happened
to your kid

08:58.630 --> 09:00.029
Make you hate like this.

09:02.540 --> 09:05.566
Go now, buddy. Save your son.

09:18.190 --> 09:21.409
(sighs)

09:30.500 --> 09:33.799
(horn honking)

09:42.740 --> 09:44.776
Now who the hell is this?

09:44.780 --> 09:46.247
Who the hell is who?

09:50.280 --> 09:51.645
Get down!

09:59.630 --> 10:02.758
Find out right now who leaked
that video call to the press.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.398
Excuse me, ma'am.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.721
We have some information
on delman birch for you.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.389
Did you find his son?

10:08.400 --> 10:09.867
No, something else.

10:24.990 --> 10:26.742
(panﬁng)

10:26.760 --> 10:28.387
Wait, what are you doing?

10:32.560 --> 10:36.997
We found out his son uses his
mother's maiden name, not birch.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.888
His mother's maiden name is
hawkIns, so he's delman...

10:38.900 --> 10:41.869
Delman hawkins,
missing in action.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.335
(beep)

10:46.770 --> 10:48.977
(panﬁng)

10:54.680 --> 10:56.375
Dad.

10:58.620 --> 11:00.281
Is it really you?

11:00.290 --> 11:03.259
Yeah.

11:03.260 --> 11:04.818
It's me.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.821
(panﬁng)

11:06.830 --> 11:08.593
I'm sick, dad.

11:08.600 --> 11:11.194
I brought something for that.

11:13.630 --> 11:15.359
(bag unzipping)

11:20.610 --> 11:22.532
How does he seem?

11:22.540 --> 11:24.872
Well, he's not shaking
anymore, but...

11:24.880 --> 11:26.279
But what?

11:26.280 --> 11:28.339
But, uh, he's got
this look in his eyes.

11:28.350 --> 11:29.772
I've never seen it before.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.781
What's been going on in here?

11:31.790 --> 11:33.815
Now, give your son the phone.

11:33.820 --> 11:35.959
They told me
he was missing in action.

11:35.960 --> 11:37.985
I'm-I'm not giving him the
phone until you tell me

11:37.990 --> 11:39.787
What they've done
to my son in here.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.428
Give me the phone.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.622
This is hawkins.

11:45.630 --> 11:48.861
Hawkins, we met a long time ago

11:48.870 --> 11:50.997
When you were first selected
for the program.

11:51.010 --> 11:52.466
I'm sorry, I don't remember you.

11:52.470 --> 11:54.734
A lot's happened since then.

11:54.740 --> 11:56.879
Are you ready to receive orders?

11:56.880 --> 11:59.371
Yes. Please authenticate
that you have

11:59.380 --> 12:01.712
The authority to give them.

12:01.720 --> 12:05.918
Francis... You've never
spoken these words.

12:05.920 --> 12:09.549
And once you say them,
once he hears them,

12:09.560 --> 12:12.085
There's no going back.

12:14.060 --> 12:15.948
There
/5
no going back.

12:20.870 --> 12:23.338
Lawn chair.

12:23.340 --> 12:25.535
Griffin. Broken stick.

12:25.540 --> 12:28.202
Harbor.

12:28.210 --> 12:30.770
Rusty chain. Smoke.

12:30.780 --> 12:33.578
Lawn chair. Griffin.
Broken stick.

12:33.580 --> 12:35.844
Harbor. Rusty chain. Smoke.

12:39.520 --> 12:42.353
Who do I have to kill?

12:42.360 --> 12:43.918
Buddy's son is
delman hawkins.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.023
One of the soldiers
you and finley pulled

12:46.030 --> 12:47.122
From the pakistani embassy?

12:47.130 --> 12:48.597
One of widener's hit squad,

12:48.600 --> 12:50.522
And widener is testifying
on the hill right now.

12:50.530 --> 12:52.259
All right, I'll increase
security on the hill.

12:52.270 --> 12:54.397
You get out there.
I need to make a stop
in alexandria first.

12:54.400 --> 12:55.731
The bulletin we put out

12:55.740 --> 12:57.765
For signs of c-4 usage
came back a hit.

12:57.770 --> 12:59.761
An explosion at a
store in alexandria

12:59.780 --> 13:01.304
With armored doors
and wmdows.

13:01.310 --> 13:02.732
What kind of store?

13:02.740 --> 13:04.298
Business forms.

13:04.310 --> 13:05.971
With armored doors
and windows?
I know. Black site.

13:05.980 --> 13:08.813
The blood they took from
that boy-- any sign of it yet?

13:08.820 --> 13:10.811
This just happened; they haven't
processed the scene yet.

13:10.820 --> 13:14.278
Go find out
what our father-son team

13:14.290 --> 13:15.780
Was doing at that black site.

13:15.790 --> 13:17.553
Yes, sir.

13:20.490 --> 13:23.050
(phone ringing)

13:25.300 --> 13:26.995
Yeah.

13:28.770 --> 13:31.034
It's for you, miss fitch.

13:32.740 --> 13:34.298
Yes?

13:34.310 --> 13:35.937
Francis (distorted):
Last time we spoke,

13:35.940 --> 13:38.101
_ I said _we were
just getting started.

13:38.110 --> 13:41.443
Do something for me today,

13:41.450 --> 13:42.644
Your daughter walks out of here.

13:42.650 --> 13:44.242
Why should I believe you
this time?

13:44.250 --> 13:46.445
The only thing
you need to believe

13:46.450 --> 13:48.657
Is that there was a dead boy
in a barn,

13:48.660 --> 13:51.413
And a mother who put him there.

13:51.430 --> 13:53.751
I know who you are, francis.

13:53.760 --> 13:55.250
We all do.

13:56.700 --> 13:58.827
You are going to testify
against widener today.

13:58.830 --> 14:01.526
I need you to take a weapon
into that senate hearing.

14:01.540 --> 14:03.599
How?

14:03.610 --> 14:06.204
You've been counseled
to plead the fifth.

14:06.210 --> 14:08.269
You will change
your legal strategy.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.771
You have retained new counsel.

14:10.780 --> 14:13.601
And who is that?

14:26.960 --> 14:28.450
Hey.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.893
How long do you think it's been?

14:32.900 --> 14:34.561
Since...

14:34.570 --> 14:36.663
They gave your dad
that demand?

14:36.670 --> 14:38.900
An hour.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.201
He won't give
in to them.

14:48.550 --> 14:51.883
That secret service agent said
they're coming in for us.

14:51.890 --> 14:53.642
They're gonna get us out.
If they were gonna

14:53.660 --> 14:54.809
Come in, they
would've come.

14:54.820 --> 14:55.980
These people here,

14:55.990 --> 14:57.355
They're smarter than the fbi.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.248
But not smarter
than your father.

15:00.660 --> 15:01.991
He knew the fbi
would be here soon.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.991
He said he had a plan
to get us out

15:04.000 --> 15:05.194
When that happened.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.191
If my dad says
he has a plan,

15:07.200 --> 15:09.361
Then he has a plan.

15:09.370 --> 15:11.861
It'll be okay.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.406
Koz:
Hey.

15:16.510 --> 15:17.534
What do you want?

15:17.550 --> 15:20.075
Him.

15:33.260 --> 15:35.626
Finley:
Kyle.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.723
Stand closer to him.

15:37.730 --> 15:40.790
Put your arm
around him, son.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.438
Proof of life.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.863
They all just saw me outside,
so they know I'm better

15:44.870 --> 15:46.633
Than any newspaper
you could hold.

15:46.640 --> 15:49.438
Yeah, you're quick.

15:49.440 --> 15:51.305
Put your head down.

15:51.310 --> 15:53.198
Lower your head.

15:53.210 --> 15:54.905
Y_our_ dad won't
give In to them.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.649
I know.

15:57.420 --> 16:00.014
Show me your face.

16:01.060 --> 16:02.652
Hey, I said show me...

16:02.660 --> 16:04.810
(grunts)

16:05.990 --> 16:08.823
Get his gun, lqle!
Get his gun!

16:08.830 --> 16:10.058
Hey!

16:10.070 --> 16:11.128
Whoa! Whoa.

16:11.130 --> 16:13.860
Now you stand
next to him.

16:15.670 --> 16:18.138
I can't shoot you yet,

16:18.140 --> 16:20.734
But I will break
your knees.

16:29.150 --> 16:31.311
(shutter clicks)

16:31.320 --> 16:33.288
Man:
Sir?

16:33.290 --> 16:34.985
We need you in the control room.

16:34.990 --> 16:36.059
Sir?

16:37.260 --> 16:40.252
I know you're not
running this show.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.752
You're not smart enough.

16:46.630 --> 16:49.190
You're lucky
I still need you.

17:04.890 --> 17:06.846
We'll get him next time.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.782
It's okay, lqle;
we'll get him next time.

17:08.790 --> 17:10.382
Devo re :
Agent finley.

17:10.390 --> 17:11.880
What's his status?

17:11.890 --> 17:13.323
We don't know, sir.

17:13.330 --> 17:14.627
Mrs. Devore:
What about luke?

17:14.630 --> 17:16.655
The hostage they released.
How is he?

17:16.660 --> 17:18.799
Not good, ma'am.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.825
They don't know
what's wrong with him.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.865
He's... He's dying.

17:22.870 --> 17:25.964
The doctors don't
expect him to make the day.

17:25.970 --> 17:27.506
You find out
what they did to him.

17:27.510 --> 17:29.637
You can't let him die.

17:29.640 --> 17:31.904
Yes, ma'am.

17:31.910 --> 17:33.207
(clears throat)

17:33.210 --> 17:36.145
IfI may ask, sir,
about your boy...

17:37.680 --> 17:40.683
If you've...

17:40.690 --> 17:43.614
Decided to make_a statement
of any kInd?

17:44.430 --> 17:46.318
Widener's on the hill today.

17:46.330 --> 17:48.184
Cia hearings have started.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.794
I assume that's why gibson
is making this demand on me.

17:54.900 --> 17:56.959
But you know that I can't.

17:58.610 --> 18:01.659
This office can't give in
to any demand.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.604
I understand.

18:06.050 --> 18:08.075
Director olsen...

18:08.080 --> 18:09.570
When the kidnappers call you

18:09.580 --> 18:12.185
To tell you that
they're going to... Do it...

18:13.590 --> 18:16.855
...I want you to put that call
through to us.

18:16.860 --> 18:18.418
I want to be there.

18:18.430 --> 18:21.820
Yes, ma'am.

18:43.980 --> 18:45.789
Reporter:
Ms. Fitch,
are the allegations true?

18:45.790 --> 18:47.087
Ms. Fitch, is your
company involved

18:47.090 --> 18:48.216
In illegal cia programs?

18:48.220 --> 18:49.482
Did you know
about the soldiers

18:49.490 --> 18:50.889
Held under
the pakistani embassy?

18:50.890 --> 18:52.426
Do you know
who took your daughter?

18:52.430 --> 18:54.625
Will you testify
or take the fifth?

18:54.630 --> 18:55.824
That man will be joining us.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.127
What do you mean,
joining us?

18:57.130 --> 18:58.427
Meg:
As outside counsel.

18:58.430 --> 18:59.761
Clayton: What are
you talking about?

18:59.770 --> 19:01.624
I use _him for
certain cna matters,

19:01.640 --> 19:04.894
To keep a firewall between you
and that part of the business.

19:04.910 --> 19:06.969
You had outside counsel
that I didn't know about?

19:06.980 --> 19:08.459
Yes.
Who is he really, meg?

19:08.480 --> 19:09.833
Just do your job,
clayton, and remember

19:09.840 --> 19:11.979
Who you work for.
Ms. Fitch.

19:11.980 --> 19:14.574
This is kurt heller.

19:14.580 --> 19:16.810
He'll be joining our
team as outside counsel.

19:16.820 --> 19:19.641
He needs to be cleared to enter
the senate hearing with us.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.253
We put his name in the system;
I'm sure it's come up

19:23.260 --> 19:25.012
On the list by now.
I'll just check that out.

19:25.030 --> 19:27.225
I.D., please?

19:33.700 --> 19:35.258
They're running it now.

19:35.270 --> 19:37.864
Copy that.

19:41.010 --> 19:43.035
Mr. Heller, you are clear.

19:43.040 --> 19:46.476
I'll need a room_ where I_can
speak With ms. Fitch in private.

19:46.480 --> 19:48.448
Clayton:
I'm sure we can find a room

19:48.450 --> 19:50.270
_ Where these _
fbi agents won't mind

19:50.290 --> 19:51.609
Waiting outside
while we spoke.

19:51.620 --> 19:54.111
I think mr. Heller wants
to talk to me alone.

19:55.390 --> 19:57.051
Isn't that right?

19:57.060 --> 19:59.722
Yes. That's right.

20:08.140 --> 20:10.358
Can I ask if you've
seen my daughter?

20:10.370 --> 20:11.530
No.

20:11.540 --> 20:13.269
But I have
something for you.

20:20.980 --> 20:22.641
A two-way transmitter?

20:22.650 --> 20:25.073
When we go in,
you'll wear it.

20:25.090 --> 20:27.012
So gibson can
be in my head.

20:27.020 --> 20:29.318
I wouldn't know, ma'am.

20:29.320 --> 20:32.084
Let me look at you.

20:33.690 --> 20:37.319
I just want to
see your eyes.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.236
Pharmaceuticals.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.558
My pharmaceuticals.

20:47.110 --> 20:50.329
You're one of them.

20:52.380 --> 20:54.473
Can I ask your real name?

20:56.420 --> 20:58.069
Hawkins.

20:59.720 --> 21:02.609
I'm supposed to
bring in a weapon.

21:02.620 --> 21:06.078
And it's you,
isn't it, hawkins?

21:06.090 --> 21:07.978
You're the weapon.

21:19.710 --> 21:21.132
(indistinct radio transmission)

21:21.140 --> 21:22.732
Daugherty: Trace comes back
positive for c-4.

21:22.740 --> 21:25.231
Took out _the i_ro_n-barred window
along With Victim number one.

21:25.250 --> 21:26.478
Where's victim
number two?

21:26.480 --> 21:28.141
This way.

21:28.150 --> 21:30.948
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

21:32.920 --> 21:35.218
Actually, yeah.
Yeah, I have.

21:39.290 --> 21:40.484
Empty.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.127
Yeah, there were
blood vials in it,

21:42.130 --> 21:45.054
But they're empty,
too. Over here.

21:48.300 --> 21:50.632
Waiting for an ID.
On that one.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.062
That's delman birch.

21:52.070 --> 21:54.436
Blast didn't kill him.
Strangled.

21:54.440 --> 21:56.670
Someone used his hands.

21:56.680 --> 21:58.739
Suspect for this one
is delman hawkins.

21:58.750 --> 22:00.274
That's mr. Birch's son.

22:00.280 --> 22:01.599
What was going on in here?

22:01.620 --> 22:04.077
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

22:08.020 --> 22:10.250
Dunn:
I found the vials, but no blood.

22:10.260 --> 22:11.784
Doctor: _
We're running out of time.

22:11.790 --> 22:13.485
Something in his bloodstream
is causing him

22:13.490 --> 22:15.287
To deteriorate rapidly.

22:15.300 --> 22:17.621
Whatever's in luke's blood
was injected into another man.

22:17.630 --> 22:18.995
I need to know exactly what.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.467
If it's what I think it is

22:20.470 --> 22:21.789
It's an advanced_cocktail
of amphetamines.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.267
I need the exact ingredients.

22:23.270 --> 22:26.137
His organs are beginning
to shut down.

22:26.140 --> 22:28.358
He was strangled.
There are no bullet wounds.

22:28.380 --> 22:29.779
So, whose blood is this?

22:29.780 --> 22:32.169
The only survivor.
From shrapnel wounds.

22:32.180 --> 22:33.807
We didn't find him right away
because he had managed

22:33.820 --> 22:35.173
To drag himself
into that closet.

22:35.180 --> 22:36.374
Another agent
like the woman out there?

22:36.380 --> 22:38.109
This one had on
a white lab coat.

22:38.120 --> 22:40.441
Where is he?
Bus took him five minutes

22:40.460 --> 22:41.518
Before you got here.
Stop that ambulance

22:41.520 --> 22:43.681
So I can get to him.

22:47.960 --> 22:49.552
Agent finley?

22:49.560 --> 22:52.222
(grunts)

22:54.370 --> 22:56.361
I killed hurst.

22:58.540 --> 23:00.235
I know.

23:00.240 --> 23:03.937
Do my parents know what I did?

23:04.980 --> 23:07.540
Yes, lqle, they do.

23:07.550 --> 23:10.269
I had to.

23:12.250 --> 23:13.911
Hurst was gonna kill mr. Gibson.

23:13.920 --> 23:17.253
You did what you had
to do, kyle.

23:17.260 --> 23:19.285
Your parents are proud of you.

23:21.030 --> 23:24.522
Kyle, why exactly was hurst
trying to kill mr. Gibson?

23:24.530 --> 23:27.067
It was during the attack.

23:27.070 --> 23:28.594
They were calling my name.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.397
They were trying
to get to me.

23:30.410 --> 23:31.763
Hurst had a gun

23:31.770 --> 23:33.067
To mr. Gibson's head.

23:33.070 --> 23:35.061
I had to...

23:35.080 --> 23:36.832
Hurst shot you, ﬁnley.

23:38.510 --> 23:40.603
He's bad, right?

23:41.950 --> 23:43.770
He's one of them.

23:46.120 --> 23:49.112
Kyle, you did the right thing.

23:49.120 --> 23:50.587
(grunts)

23:53.730 --> 23:54.788
Okay.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.529
Okay, lqle, I'm free.

23:56.530 --> 23:57.792
Someone's coming.

23:57.800 --> 23:59.119
Come here.

23:59.130 --> 24:02.190
You let them in,
and I take them out.

24:02.200 --> 24:03.565
I get to the command center,

24:03.570 --> 24:05.458
I turn off the mines,
and we go home, okay?

24:05.470 --> 24:08.064
No, they are going
to kill me today.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.105
No, they're not.

24:10.110 --> 24:12.305
(keys jingling)

24:12.310 --> 24:15.302
Nice move with the pipe.

24:15.320 --> 24:18.369
You don't think
we have cameras?

24:18.390 --> 24:20.881
I'm not getting
anywhere near you.

24:20.890 --> 24:21.948
Let's go, finley.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.315
I'll put one through
both of you.

24:34.470 --> 24:37.598
(gate closes)

24:37.610 --> 24:40.807
(siren wailing)

24:46.350 --> 24:47.840
This man needs to be moved.

24:47.850 --> 24:49.340
This man needs _
to answer some questions,

24:49.350 --> 24:50.578
And then he can go.

24:50.590 --> 24:51.739
Where's hawkins?

24:51.750 --> 24:53.615
I don't know.

24:53.620 --> 24:55.110
But he walked out of here.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.610
He's operational again.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.588
He was injected with blood
taken from a dying boy.

24:58.590 --> 25:01.024
Is that how they got
the cocktail into hawkins?

25:01.030 --> 25:02.827
It must be.

25:02.830 --> 25:04.650
Well, it's killing that boy,
and I don't want to see

25:04.670 --> 25:06.592
Any more dead kids,
so this is what's gonna happen.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.295
You're gonna talk to the doctor
and you're gonna tell him

25:08.300 --> 25:09.597
Exactly what was in it

25:09.600 --> 25:11.488
So we can save his life;
are we clear?

25:11.510 --> 25:13.603
Only clarenbach
knows exactly.

25:13.610 --> 25:15.066
I'll do my best.

25:16.280 --> 25:19.101
Agent dunn, patch me
through to quarantine.

25:26.450 --> 25:27.747
(guard grunts)

25:29.220 --> 25:31.211
Agent finley, they're
going to question you.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.686
Like they questioned me.

25:32.690 --> 25:34.555
Do I get dinner with this show?

25:34.560 --> 25:35.857
No, listen to me.

25:35.860 --> 25:37.225
They set up
hurst, they...

25:37.230 --> 25:38.595
(groans)

25:40.470 --> 25:42.222
Koz:
It's his turn to talk now.

25:46.310 --> 25:48.870
I want to know
every piece of eqUIpment.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.201
Every law
enforcement agency.

25:51.210 --> 25:53.576
How many agents,
how many soldiers,

25:53.580 --> 25:55.047
Where they are now.

25:55.050 --> 25:57.075
You should ask somebody else.

26:01.190 --> 26:02.919
Is this where hurst shot you?

26:02.920 --> 26:05.309
(groans)

26:07.560 --> 26:09.323
The minefield will
have a kill switch.

26:09.330 --> 26:10.695
Get to that.

26:10.700 --> 26:12.588
They will keep beating
you, agent finley!

26:12.600 --> 26:14.022
What's the count matter?
Just tell them!

26:14.040 --> 26:15.496
Just-just tell them!

26:15.500 --> 26:19.504
I'm not buying it, gibson.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.102
What are you looking for?

26:23.110 --> 26:26.341
Someone who knows how to hit.

26:29.080 --> 26:31.116
Take him back to the hole.

26:31.120 --> 26:34.112
Take that one
back to gen pop.

26:35.060 --> 26:37.949
(grunting)

26:41.960 --> 26:44.849
Unlock these.
I've got work to do.

26:47.570 --> 26:50.733
We've already warned capitol
police to be on the lookout,

26:50.740 --> 26:52.435
But you should be, too.

26:52.440 --> 26:54.362
Hawkins, one of widener's
hit squad is unaccounted for.

26:54.380 --> 26:56.598
You think hawkins
is coming here?

26:56.610 --> 26:58.237
Widener's about to testify.

26:58.250 --> 27:01.549
If gibson follows his pattern,
then the target is cia.

27:01.550 --> 27:03.643
Thank you for warning me, susie.

27:03.650 --> 27:06.539
I'll see you when you get here.

27:06.550 --> 27:08.916
She'll be here in 15 minutes.

27:08.920 --> 27:11.218
She'll recognize me.
Delay her.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.653
No, if I do anything,
she'll know something's wrong.

27:13.660 --> 27:17.790
If we fail,
your daughter dies.

27:32.650 --> 27:34.971
Meg:
Can you hear me?

27:43.420 --> 27:45.183
You were told not to use
this transmitter

27:45.190 --> 27:47.454
Until you were
inside the hearing.

27:47.460 --> 27:50.429
We won't get inside the hearing.

27:50.430 --> 27:52.557
Not without your help.

28:03.210 --> 28:04.529
Agent dunn

28:04.550 --> 28:06.677
Cannot get into
that hearing room.

28:06.680 --> 28:09.103
Copy that.

28:09.120 --> 28:10.212
Man:
Capitol police dispatch,

28:10.220 --> 28:11.869
Zero-18, go ahead.

28:11.890 --> 28:14.347
This is fbi incident command,
baker three alpha.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.715
Be advised, you have
an inbound security threat.

28:16.720 --> 28:20.053
Suspect is a white female, 30,
impersonating an fbi agent.

28:20.060 --> 28:22.221
Sending you her photo now.

28:24.700 --> 28:27.965
Ms. Fitch,
you've been called.

28:29.740 --> 28:32.391
Fbi agent dunn.
Which way is the hearing?

28:36.740 --> 28:38.537
(shutters clicking)

28:39.880 --> 28:43.179
Widener: Chairman,
this so-called "massacre video"

28:43.180 --> 28:44.408
That was released online

28:44.420 --> 28:47.014
Was not a part
of a cia operation.

28:47.020 --> 28:50.888
Nor do we have any records that
the individuals involved have

28:50.890 --> 28:54.018
Ever worked for our agency.

28:54.030 --> 28:55.657
She got hawkins in.

28:55.660 --> 28:57.389
We can't even find the records
of the victims, which...

28:57.400 --> 28:59.027
You will abandon the statement

28:59.030 --> 29:00.497
Your lawyers have
prepared for you.

29:00.500 --> 29:02.229
You will say
what I tell you to say.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.561
If you obey, I will release
amber immediately.

29:04.570 --> 29:06.834
If you disobey,
I will kill amber.

29:06.840 --> 29:08.068
Tell me you understand.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.502
I understand.

29:09.510 --> 29:11.000
And my sister is unharmed?

29:11.010 --> 29:12.272
Thank you, director widener.

29:17.220 --> 29:19.279
At this time,
the committee would like to call

29:19.290 --> 29:21.588
Porter pearce ceo
meg fitch.

29:26.130 --> 29:28.553
Ms. Fitch,
you've been called today

29:28.560 --> 29:30.790
To answer allegations

29:30.800 --> 29:32.859
That your company is linked
to that horrible video

29:32.870 --> 29:36.237
Showing american servicemen
shooting innocent civilians.

29:36.240 --> 29:37.969
Francis_: I welcome_ the
opportunity, mr. Chairman.

29:37.970 --> 29:39.961
I welcome the opportunity,
mr. Chairman.

29:39.970 --> 29:42.131
Please raise your right hand.

29:42.140 --> 29:44.028
Do you swear
that the testimony

29:44.040 --> 29:45.769
You give before
this senate committee today

29:45.780 --> 29:47.441
Will be the truth,
the whole truth

29:47.450 --> 29:48.644
And nothing but the truth?

29:48.650 --> 29:50.413
I do.

29:50.420 --> 29:53.947
I understand that you'd like
to read an opening statement.

30:00.330 --> 30:02.150
Ms. Fitch?

30:02.160 --> 30:03.821
(whispers):
Meg?

30:03.830 --> 30:05.650
(indistinct chatter
through earpiece)

30:05.670 --> 30:09.390
Mr. Chairman, it was
my intention to make a statement

30:09.400 --> 30:11.960
And then to assert
my fifth amendment right

30:11.970 --> 30:14.359
Against self-incrimination.

30:15.410 --> 30:18.106
But the truth is...

30:18.110 --> 30:22.001
But the truth is
that my company designed

30:22.020 --> 30:25.512
And manufactured a drug
for a secret cia program

30:25.520 --> 30:27.340
Run by director widener.

30:27.350 --> 30:29.238
The drug chemically

30:29.260 --> 30:31.854
Suppresses the user's
sense of morality

30:31.860 --> 30:33.452
And self-preservation.

30:33.460 --> 30:35.348
Director widener administered

30:35.360 --> 30:37.499
Our drug to unsuspecting
u.S. Special forces...

30:37.500 --> 30:39.923
Director widener administered

30:39.930 --> 30:42.694
Our drug to unsuspecting
u.S. Special forces soldiers

30:42.700 --> 30:45.032
Selected to be a part
of a special cia unit.

30:45.040 --> 30:46.632
Mr. Chairman,
I'd like to respond...

30:46.640 --> 30:48.835
An illegal

30:48.840 --> 30:50.432
And unsanctioned unit

30:50.440 --> 30:52.670
With a mission_to
assassmate americans

30:52.680 --> 30:55.001
Whom director widener
designated

30:55.020 --> 30:56.544
As enemies of the state.

30:56.550 --> 30:57.619
Mr. Chairman!

30:57.620 --> 31:00.418
That's got to hurt.

31:01.820 --> 31:04.118
Now ask them to show the tape.

31:04.120 --> 31:07.783
Tell them you can
shed some light on it.

31:07.800 --> 31:10.519
_ Olsen:
You Will release agent dunn

31:10.530 --> 31:12.828
Immediately
and put her on the phone.

31:12.830 --> 31:15.060
Yes, sir.

31:15.070 --> 31:18.392
Sir, this wasn't
a misunderstanding.

31:18.410 --> 31:19.729
This was gibson.

31:19.740 --> 31:22.231
He's got a mole in our system.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.832
We're on that here.

31:23.840 --> 31:26.843
Dunn, there's only one reason
he'd delay you.

31:26.850 --> 31:30.411
Hawkins must be here.

31:30.420 --> 31:33.014
(gunfire playing over video)

31:33.020 --> 31:35.113
(child screaming over video)

31:40.360 --> 31:44.148
This video wasn't recorded
in a foreign country.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.821
It was taken in
gaithersburg, maryland.

31:45.830 --> 31:47.718
Meg: This video wasn't recorded
in a foreign country.

31:47.740 --> 31:51.733
It was taken in
gaithersburg, maryland,

31:51.740 --> 31:55.005
At the home of human rights
activist stanley travis.

31:55.010 --> 31:58.332
When mr. Travis discovered
What we were domg

31:58.350 --> 31:59.840
And threatened
to go to the press...

31:59.850 --> 32:01.408
Man (over video): You're shot?
Man 2: What?

32:01.420 --> 32:02.944
You got a hole
right through you;

32:02.950 --> 32:04.372
You can't feel that?

32:04.390 --> 32:06.540
Director Widener sent
his death squad

32:06.550 --> 32:09.917
To make mr. Travis
and his family disappear.

32:09.920 --> 32:12.753
...Director Widener sent
his death squad

32:12.760 --> 32:15.251
To make mr. Travis
and his family disappear.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.692
Man:
We're killing kids?

32:17.700 --> 32:20.965
No, we're killing everybody.

32:20.970 --> 32:22.460
(gunfire)

32:23.900 --> 32:27.199
There was no death squad.

32:27.210 --> 32:29.269
The first time
I saw this video

32:29.280 --> 32:31.236
Is when it appeared
on the internet.

32:31.250 --> 32:34.947
A drug that inhibits morality
that we give to soldiers

32:34.950 --> 32:36.315
That makes them kill

32:36.320 --> 32:38.538
Women and children,
to kill each other?

32:42.420 --> 32:44.308
Say nothing, meg.

32:44.330 --> 32:46.355
Ms. Fitch...

32:50.930 --> 32:54.058
That was the only time
that ever happened.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.761
The only time
we killed each other.

32:57.770 --> 32:59.704
(people murmuring,
cameras clicking)

33:01.740 --> 33:04.971
The first generation of
the drug was unstable.

33:04.980 --> 33:07.141
They smoothed it out
after that.

33:07.150 --> 33:09.243
It works real well now.

33:09.250 --> 33:11.343
Get away from my Wife.

33:13.090 --> 33:14.341
Sir, exactly who are you?

33:14.360 --> 33:16.419
Hawkins, del.
Sergeant first class.

33:16.420 --> 33:18.456
You're the man in that video.

33:18.460 --> 33:20.519
Yes, sir, I am.

33:20.530 --> 33:22.088
(people murmuring)

33:24.830 --> 33:26.764
Hawkins: You ordered us
to kill innocents.

33:26.770 --> 33:28.761
Is he gonna kill her?

33:28.770 --> 33:31.398
That is entirely up to Widener.

33:32.940 --> 33:35.738
Why are you afraid of me, sir...

33:38.510 --> 33:40.341
...If there is no death squad?

33:40.350 --> 33:42.102
IfI didn't kill those people,

33:42.120 --> 33:44.008
Why are you
afraid of me?

33:44.020 --> 33:46.113
Please, just step away
from my Wife.

33:46.120 --> 33:49.851
You're going to have
to order me to do it.

33:49.860 --> 33:51.816
I order you to step away
from my Wife.

33:51.830 --> 33:54.685
Authenticate it.

34:06.340 --> 34:08.604
Authenticate it, sir.

34:17.020 --> 34:18.749
Authenticating.

34:18.750 --> 34:21.241
Lawn chair. Griffin.

34:21.260 --> 34:24.388
Broken stick. Harbor.

34:24.390 --> 34:26.881
Rusty chain.

34:26.890 --> 34:29.324
Smoke.

34:29.330 --> 34:32.219
Authenticated.

34:33.930 --> 34:35.363
What are my orders?

34:35.370 --> 34:38.396
Stand down.

34:38.410 --> 34:40.059
(people murmuring)

34:44.440 --> 34:47.978
Fbi! Hands behind your head!
On your knees now!

34:50.950 --> 34:52.941
(gavel pounding)

34:52.950 --> 34:55.145
It's over, francis.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.150
You got him.

35:02.360 --> 35:04.521
Destroy my notebooks.

35:13.310 --> 35:16.837
Sergeant hawkins,
on your knees now!

35:42.600 --> 35:43.794
In a surprise development today,

35:43.800 --> 35:45.631
The head of the cia
all but admitted

35:45.640 --> 35:47.062
To using illegal death squads

35:47.070 --> 35:48.662
To assassinate innocent
american CIVIlians.

35:51.740 --> 35:54.607
Delman hawkins,
you're under arrest.

35:54.620 --> 35:56.269
I have no more orders.

35:56.280 --> 36:00.284
Del, you killed
your father today.

36:00.290 --> 36:02.645
Why did you do that?

36:02.660 --> 36:05.982
He wanted me to go with him.

36:05.990 --> 36:08.424
Kept calling me "son,"
said he was going to help me.

36:08.430 --> 36:11.456
And you don't feel anything
about that?

36:11.470 --> 36:15.429
I don't feel anything
about any of them...

36:15.440 --> 36:17.089
Until this wears off.

36:19.670 --> 36:21.365
Agent dunn, I'd appreciate it

36:21.380 --> 36:23.769
If you'd put a bullet
in my head.

36:26.050 --> 36:28.177
Let's go. Come on.

36:38.990 --> 36:40.218
You remember
the questions?

36:40.230 --> 36:42.323
I remember a play
my niece was in.

36:42.330 --> 36:43.490
She gave a better performance.

36:43.500 --> 36:45.127
Koz:
How many agents?

36:45.130 --> 36:46.495
(taser crackles, finley grunts)

36:46.500 --> 36:47.626
How many soldiers?

36:47.630 --> 36:48.665
(yells)

36:48.670 --> 36:49.796
What's the plan?!

36:49.800 --> 36:51.961
(grunting)

36:51.970 --> 36:53.198
(panﬁng)

36:53.210 --> 36:55.633
You don't want to talk? Fine.

36:55.640 --> 36:58.074
I'll let you sit back and watch.

36:58.080 --> 37:01.345
You're gonna love
this next part.

37:01.350 --> 37:03.272
Bring him in.

37:04.420 --> 37:06.308
Mr. Gibson? Finley?

37:06.320 --> 37:07.389
Devore,

37:07.390 --> 37:08.709
Your parents need to know

37:08.720 --> 37:10.256
What happens if they fail.

37:11.660 --> 37:13.150
Set it up!

37:14.430 --> 37:15.920
Mr. Gibson?

37:15.930 --> 37:18.091
(stutters)
finley?

37:18.100 --> 37:20.091
Whatever you're gonna do to him,
do it to me!

37:20.100 --> 37:21.897
No one cares about you.

37:21.900 --> 37:23.891
Turn the feed on!

37:23.900 --> 37:25.868
No,no,no!

37:25.870 --> 37:27.838
Please, you don't
have to do this.

37:27.840 --> 37:29.398
Finley: Do it to me!
You hear me?!

37:29.410 --> 37:32.231
We asked a question of
the president earlier today.

37:32.250 --> 37:36.107
We're waiting
for our answer now.

37:36.120 --> 37:38.372
Look, we have your plane
fueled and ready for takeoff.

37:38.390 --> 37:39.743
Turn off the mines,

37:39.750 --> 37:41.411
And we'll bring the bus
right to your door.

37:41.420 --> 37:43.957
Thing is, if you're
complying with our demands,

37:43.960 --> 37:45.848
Why are you still here?

37:47.090 --> 37:49.524
The first lady asked
to be patched in on this.

37:49.530 --> 37:51.919
Should I do that?

37:53.230 --> 37:56.358
Mom, someone,
do something, please.

37:56.370 --> 37:58.133
Oh, my god.

37:58.140 --> 37:59.732
Help me, please.
Kyle.

37:59.740 --> 38:02.436
Sir, we can go,
but if the place

38:02.440 --> 38:04.931
Is rigged to explode,
they'll all die.

38:04.950 --> 38:06.030
I know.

38:06.050 --> 38:07.574
Please, I don't want to die.

38:07.580 --> 38:10.515
We're ready for our pardons,
mr. President.

38:13.090 --> 38:15.285
Kyle:
Dad, please, do-do something!
Kyle.

38:15.290 --> 38:18.453
I_Want an answer
in ten seconds!

38:18.460 --> 38:21.588
Ten, nine...

38:21.600 --> 38:23.227
You don't want to do this.
...Eight,

38:23.230 --> 38:27.098
Seven, six,

38:27.100 --> 38:28.260
Five...

38:28.270 --> 38:29.726
I'm sorry.
...Four,

38:29.740 --> 38:30.764
Three...

38:30.770 --> 38:32.135
I don't want to die.

38:32.140 --> 38:33.630
Two...

38:35.510 --> 38:36.636
This is What happens When

38:36.640 --> 38:37.629
You say no to our demands,

38:37.640 --> 38:39.505
Mr. President!

38:39.510 --> 38:41.148
(gunshot)

38:41.150 --> 38:43.243
(francis gasping)

38:47.120 --> 38:49.281
(groans)

38:49.290 --> 38:51.281
(static crackling)

38:51.290 --> 38:53.349
Kyle...
What happened?

38:53.360 --> 38:55.954
(static crackling)

38:55.960 --> 38:58.394
You think I only have
one bullet?

38:59.200 --> 39:00.462
No, please.

39:00.470 --> 39:01.926
There's no sense in shooting him

39:01.940 --> 39:04.431
When you don't have
an audience.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.396
Please.

39:07.210 --> 39:08.507
Please.

39:17.220 --> 39:19.643
(gasping)

39:22.320 --> 39:24.049
They're still
gonna kill him.

39:26.530 --> 39:28.452
They shot you.

39:29.660 --> 39:31.855
I'm aware of that.

39:31.870 --> 39:34.964
(groaning)

39:34.970 --> 39:37.234
You son of a bitch,
they shot you.

39:38.970 --> 39:40.506
You shot him
with a real bullet.

39:40.510 --> 39:42.364
Why would I shoot him
with a fake one?

39:42.380 --> 39:44.735
Why would you shoot
him at all?
He told me to.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.479
No, he told you
to shoot kyle.

39:46.480 --> 39:47.799
Then he risked his life

39:47.810 --> 39:49.539
Trying to stop you
from shooting kyle.

39:49.550 --> 39:51.142
I was never
gonna shoot kyle.

39:51.150 --> 39:54.813
But the president said no
to the miss... Mission.

39:54.820 --> 39:57.584
Saying no
was _
the missmn.

39:57.590 --> 40:00.184
We force the president
to say no,

40:00.190 --> 40:02.329
The world knows
that means we kill his son.

40:02.330 --> 40:05.254
As soon as they see gibson
take a bullet for him...

40:05.270 --> 40:06.521
(liquid hissing)

40:06.530 --> 40:09.658
...Mr. Gibson--
all-american hero.

40:09.670 --> 40:12.264
So that's Why
finley's really here.

40:12.270 --> 40:15.398
As an eyewitness
to the shooting.

40:15.410 --> 40:17.776
We need him to swear
it really happened.

40:17.780 --> 40:19.873
That all makes sense
except for the part

40:19.880 --> 40:22.440
Where gibson dies
from a gunshot wound.

40:22.450 --> 40:25.078
We'll be long gone
before he bleeds out.

40:25.090 --> 40:27.615
And how exactly
do we get out?

40:34.360 --> 40:36.248
Doctor:
I have good news, agent dunn.

40:36.260 --> 40:39.718
We isolated What was
in the boy's blood.

40:39.730 --> 40:40.924
He's gonna be fine.

40:40.930 --> 40:43.125
Thank you, doctor.

40:47.710 --> 40:49.905
You snuck hawkins
into that room.

40:49.910 --> 40:51.775
For amber.

40:51.780 --> 40:54.203
You had me delayed.

40:54.210 --> 40:56.917
For amber...

40:56.920 --> 40:59.309
And for you.

40:59.320 --> 41:02.187
I didn't know What was gonna
happen in that room, susie.

41:05.420 --> 41:09.550
But if she gets out,
I want her to know you.

41:11.300 --> 41:13.564
(phone ringing)

41:13.570 --> 41:15.128
(sighs)

41:15.140 --> 41:17.495
Answer it.

41:17.500 --> 41:19.161
Dunn.

41:19.170 --> 41:21.365
A hostage was just released.

41:22.940 --> 41:25.477
I'm standing here
with amber fitch.

41:27.580 --> 41:30.970
She'd very much like
to speak to her mother.

41:33.950 --> 41:35.747
It's for you.

41:38.190 --> 41:40.329
Amber:
Mom?

41:40.330 --> 41:43.493
