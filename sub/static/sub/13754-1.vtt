01:02.400 --> 01:04.631
August, 1944.

01:05.245 --> 01:07.466
The outcome
of the Second World War appeared

01:07.586 --> 01:09.507
to be no longer in doubt.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.471
Paris was liberated.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.500
After four years of fighting,

01:17.700 --> 01:20.700
victory against
the Germans seemed assured.

01:21.900 --> 01:24.200
Since the Normandy landings in June,

01:24.600 --> 01:29.100
American and Allied forces had battled
their way across Northern Europe,

01:29.400 --> 01:33.400
and pushed the German enemy
to within its own homeland.

02:01.600 --> 02:05.700
The City of Light rejoiced as
it welcomed the troops.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.600
Marching down the Champs Elysees,

02:17.900 --> 02:22.754
officers and men believed that Berlin
was within their reach.

02:23.500 --> 02:24.902
And the word was that

02:25.022 --> 02:27.500
they would be home in time
for Christmas.

02:33.200 --> 02:36.500
But when the soldiers left Paris
for the German border,

02:37.200 --> 02:39.420
their hopes began to fade.

02:53.959 --> 02:56.184
- I'm gonna make it.
- You're gonna make it.

02:56.553 --> 02:58.800
- I'm gonna make it.
- You're gonna make it.

02:59.500 --> 03:00.500
My lucky day.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.213
- It's your lucky day.
- I got the luck.

03:02.333 --> 03:03.600
You got it, Bobby.

03:04.991 --> 03:06.142
This is nothin'!

03:06.262 --> 03:07.500
It's walk in the park!

03:08.300 --> 03:10.399
- Oh!
- What's that, partner?

03:10.400 --> 03:11.600
I get to go home.

03:11.596 --> 03:12.533
You're goin' home, Bobby!

03:12.653 --> 03:13.868
I'm goin' home!

03:14.113 --> 03:15.049
Goddamn right!

03:15.402 --> 03:16.446
I'm goin' home!

03:16.566 --> 03:18.026
You know it, Bob!

03:19.070 --> 03:20.451
Hang in there, Bobby.

03:20.972 --> 03:22.400
Hang in there.

03:22.600 --> 03:23.800
You can do this.

03:24.000 --> 03:24.800
I can do this.

03:24.920 --> 03:26.065
You're tough as nails.

03:27.062 --> 03:27.937
Nails.

03:28.275 --> 03:29.518
Not good enough, Bobby.

03:29.917 --> 03:30.960
Nails!

03:31.712 --> 03:33.001
What about nails?

03:33.538 --> 03:34.398
Tough!

03:34.704 --> 03:36.800
That's right, they're fuckin' tough!

03:40.272 --> 03:43.479
God damn you! Stick with it, Bobby!

03:44.661 --> 03:47.376
Fuckin' dig in, Bobby!
Come on, who's tough as nails?

03:47.496 --> 03:48.374
Me's tough.

03:48.494 --> 03:50.798
That's right, you tough. Tough as what?

03:50.918 --> 03:51.719
Nails.

03:51.839 --> 03:53.039
That's right, now say it!

03:53.284 --> 03:54.251
Tough as nails!

03:54.371 --> 03:56.891
You're goddamned right,
you're tough as nails!

03:59.369 --> 04:01.502
Come on, stay with us, Bobby.

04:01.870 --> 04:02.745
It hurts!

04:03.266 --> 04:04.755
I know, it's less than a mile.

04:05.200 --> 04:06.458
Less than a mile to go.

04:06.578 --> 04:07.317
It's too far.

04:07.437 --> 04:09.066
No, it ain't, it ain't too far.

04:09.186 --> 04:10.324
Not gonna make it.

04:10.570 --> 04:11.567
Can that shit!

04:11.687 --> 04:12.764
Gonna die!

04:13.025 --> 04:14.222
Cut it, you're gonna make it!

04:15.081 --> 04:15.971
I'm gonna...

04:16.091 --> 04:17.368
You're gonna make it.

04:17.488 --> 04:18.534
Make it.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.062
You're damn right!

04:28.514 --> 04:35.281
Listen, Bobby, I gotta rest for a minute.
Okay? Okay, Bob?

04:37.700 --> 04:38.565
Shit!

04:44.258 --> 04:48.550
Bobby! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

04:48.670 --> 04:52.446
Stop it! Bobby, stop it! Bobby! Bobby!

04:58.600 --> 05:00.513
Welcome back, motherfucker!

05:34.808 --> 05:37.525
Promise me you won't pick me up no more.

05:39.300 --> 05:43.607
It hurts.
Don't... don't pick me up any more.

05:46.476 --> 05:51.400
Listen Bob, if I leave you,
ain't nobody gonna find you.

05:52.226 --> 05:53.868
You're gonna die out here.

05:54.251 --> 05:55.985
Just sit here for a bit.

06:02.351 --> 06:03.977
I am dying.

06:09.410 --> 06:11.052
Bob, we can't sit here.

06:11.850 --> 06:14.048
So, I gotta pick you up,
and I gotta get you out of here.

06:14.168 --> 06:14.858
No.

06:15.165 --> 06:16.600
- Come on.
- No! No!

06:16.800 --> 06:18.543
- No more! No more! No more, please.
- Let's go. Let's go, Bob.

06:18.663 --> 06:19.740
All right, all right!
All right, all right, all right!

06:19.860 --> 06:22.349
- Relax! Relax! Relax!
- No more. Please, no more.

06:22.594 --> 06:23.944
Fine, I'm not. I'm not gonna touch ya'.

06:24.282 --> 06:27.879
Okay, just relax. Just relax.

06:33.705 --> 06:34.779
Just relax.

06:41.982 --> 06:49.808
No more. No more. No more.

07:11.721 --> 07:13.544
You're not gonna leave, are ya?

07:30.990 --> 07:32.878
Got no choice, Bob.

07:35.300 --> 07:36.852
Okay.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.355
D..., David...

08:27.611 --> 08:29.621
Don't leave me here like this.

08:31.248 --> 08:33.736
Please don't leave me here like this.

08:34.457 --> 08:36.130
Don't you leave me here!

08:37.900 --> 08:43.701
David!
David, don't leave me here like this!

08:45.895 --> 08:46.770
Stop it!

08:48.120 --> 08:50.268
Don't leave me here!

08:53.421 --> 08:54.802
David...

08:55.200 --> 08:56.700
All right, get outta here!

08:59.467 --> 09:01.308
Grab my hand, buddy. There you go.

09:06.052 --> 09:09.121
1,2,3, push!

09:17.393 --> 09:19.449
More bandages, hurry it up!

09:22.277 --> 09:23.535
Come on, get up!

09:27.421 --> 09:28.833
Move that truck outta there!

09:29.577 --> 09:30.623
Where's C Company?

09:30.743 --> 09:31.695
...You kidding?

09:38.600 --> 09:41.100
Easy there, buddy. Hang in there.

09:42.725 --> 09:43.800
Chamberlain!

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Grab an end!

09:50.301 --> 09:52.664
Captain Pritchett's been lookin'
for anybody from your platoon.

09:53.907 --> 09:54.800
Where is he?

09:55.000 --> 09:56.100
Back at HQ.

09:56.715 --> 09:58.692
I'm headin' that direction
if you want a lift.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.574
Get down!

10:09.689 --> 10:10.700
Shit!

10:11.653 --> 10:12.896
You all right?

10:13.786 --> 10:15.950
Oh, my God! Oh God! Oh...

10:16.700 --> 10:18.300
Why do they leave them there like that?

10:18.500 --> 10:19.400
Fuckin' brass!

10:19.500 --> 10:21.100
They don't wanna waste
the trucks on the dead.

10:21.300 --> 10:23.400
They still got more guys to haul in
for the slaughter.

10:23.900 --> 10:25.500
No more room in hell!

10:26.072 --> 10:28.800
What'rya talkin' about?
There's plenty of room.

10:29.270 --> 10:30.900
All they gotta do is stack 'em higher.

10:31.510 --> 10:32.800
How many do you think?

10:33.244 --> 10:35.900
Hundreds.
That's just in the last five days.

10:36.344 --> 10:39.000
How can they let this happen
and still pretend to be human beings?!

10:40.476 --> 10:42.200
I haven't seen one of those sick fucks
over the rank

10:42.300 --> 10:43.800
of Captain here since I been up here.

10:44.420 --> 10:45.600
They're lookin' at points on a map!

10:46.526 --> 10:49.200
Not one of them has a fuckin' clue
what's goin' on up here.

10:50.914 --> 10:52.000
Shit flows down.

10:52.549 --> 10:55.449
Goddamned right! Regiment wipes
its ass with Battalion,

10:55.772 --> 10:57.432
Battalion wipes
its ass clean with Company,

10:57.552 --> 10:59.009
and we're left
to lick the shit off of them!

11:01.861 --> 11:02.705
Mark my words,

11:03.979 --> 11:06.894
they're gonna keep sendin' us in until
the whole fuckin' division is gone!

11:09.626 --> 11:11.100
Not me, Bedpan.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.400
Captain Pritchett, sir?
You have a Private Manning here.

11:41.673 --> 11:42.717
All right.

11:47.763 --> 11:48.760
...You Manning?

11:49.681 --> 11:50.740
I think so.

11:51.231 --> 11:52.369
Give him a straight answer, Private.

11:52.489 --> 11:53.625
Relax!

11:57.414 --> 12:00.130
You can stop looking for your platoon.
They didn't make it.

12:02.095 --> 12:03.000
What?

12:03.307 --> 12:05.072
Looks like you're the only one
who made it out.

12:05.500 --> 12:06.800
Your lucky day.

12:08.358 --> 12:09.400
Lucky day?

12:09.600 --> 12:10.600
You're alive!

12:10.921 --> 12:11.700
Am I?

12:11.800 --> 12:13.100
If you don't put a sock in it,
Private...

12:13.200 --> 12:18.133
You're gonna, what? - Can it!
Both of you! Lukas, take a walk!

12:21.700 --> 12:22.905
Fuckin' greenie!

12:24.716 --> 12:26.800
You better get used to him,
he's your new platoon leader.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.100
He'll be dead in a week.

12:29.900 --> 12:31.300
Tell me somethin'...

12:32.559 --> 12:33.802
You got your shit together?

12:34.094 --> 12:35.300
Sometimes.

12:35.598 --> 12:36.700
What's that mean?

12:37.608 --> 12:39.937
It means that sometimes
I've got it together.

12:40.057 --> 12:41.100
On the line?

12:41.806 --> 12:44.900
What do you want... Captain?

12:45.213 --> 12:47.054
The entire battalion took
a beating last night.

12:47.020 --> 12:50.475
I've heard seventy percent casualties,
but that's just talk.

12:50.844 --> 12:52.700
Whatever it is,
it must've crippled us bad.

12:53.207 --> 12:55.800
We've been pulled back without reaching
a single objective.

12:56.153 --> 12:57.900
What has this got to do with me?

12:58.301 --> 13:00.067
We're getting replacements
in from the Channel,

13:00.187 --> 13:02.213
tonight you'll be fit in with
a new squad.

13:03.532 --> 13:06.100
Congratulations, Private,
you're a Sergeant now.

13:09.886 --> 13:10.800
I don't want it.

13:11.098 --> 13:13.800
You'll get used to it.
- I don't wanna get used to it!

13:14.367 --> 13:17.500
I don't give a damn what you want!

13:18.786 --> 13:20.388
I'll put up with that mouth of yours,

13:20.508 --> 13:23.200
because I figure after surviving
a week up here,

13:23.300 --> 13:24.700
you've earned that right.

13:24.800 --> 13:27.700
You have not earned the right
to question my orders!

13:27.800 --> 13:30.000
I am absolutely the wrong man!

13:30.200 --> 13:32.900
That may be your opinion, Sergeant,
but it's not mine.

13:33.238 --> 13:35.200
You've managed to stay alive for a week.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.400
That's something the rest
of your platoon couldn't do.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.687
Call me crazy,
but from where I'm standin',

13:39.807 --> 13:41.940
that makes you qualified for the job.

13:43.100 --> 13:44.500
You're making a mistake.

13:44.800 --> 13:49.400
Your opinion is duly noted, Sergeant.
Dismissed.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.810
Sir... I've... in the woods,
I've done things...

14:00.071 --> 14:01.400
Sergeant.
- Yes?

14:01.500 --> 14:02.500
Dismissed.

14:07.256 --> 14:09.500
Request permission for a Section 8.

14:11.200 --> 14:15.100
I'm fucked up, I can't do this,
I, I, I'm no good.

14:15.300 --> 14:22.156
Listen to me, soldier, a week ago,
I had a company of almost 200 men.

14:22.276 --> 14:23.933
Now I've got 50.

14:24.731 --> 14:27.312
As hard as this may
be for you to swallow,

14:27.432 --> 14:30.000
your efforts
to stay alive hold very little value

14:30.120 --> 14:31.995
at this particular time and place.

14:32.115 --> 14:34.000
What does hold value are the objectives.

14:34.325 --> 14:35.500
The longer it takes to obtain them,

14:35.600 --> 14:38.000
the more dead we'll be stockpilin'
at the side of the road.

14:38.607 --> 14:40.543
Now it's my job
to obtain those objectives,

14:40.663 --> 14:43.134
and I will utilize anybody
at my disposal to do so.

14:43.379 --> 14:44.945
That includes you, Sergeant.

14:46.602 --> 14:49.138
Now I'm just as sorry as hell
about your bruised nerves,

14:49.258 --> 14:50.300
but you are out of your skull

14:50.400 --> 14:53.580
if you think I'm gonna let you bail on
a Section 8. Is that clear?

14:53.700 --> 14:54.900
Yes, Sir.

14:55.181 --> 14:58.195
At 1400 hours, you will rendezvous
with your new squad.

14:58.594 --> 15:00.200
You've got until
then to get your shit together.

15:00.320 --> 15:01.100
Is that clear?

15:01.300 --> 15:02.800
Yes, Sir.

15:03.121 --> 15:05.800
Good... Now, get out of my sight.

15:15.371 --> 15:20.300
Captain... when I fuck this up,
is it your fault or mine?

15:33.967 --> 15:35.100
Mind if I tag along?

15:35.977 --> 15:36.800
Suppose not.

15:37.128 --> 15:38.400
I heard about your promotion.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.300
Yeah? Where'd you hear that?

15:42.307 --> 15:44.600
Pays to have friends, man.

15:44.800 --> 15:45.600
Got a smoke?

15:45.882 --> 15:46.800
Yeah.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.900
You know, it's amazing really,
when you stop to think about it.

16:06.479 --> 16:09.800
Whole platoon fingers its way
into the Factory and...

16:09.920 --> 16:11.500
one guy makes it out to talk about it.

16:13.231 --> 16:14.697
You got twenty-five or thirty guys dead

16:14.817 --> 16:17.200
or dyin' and you walk out without
a scratch on ya.

16:17.600 --> 16:18.800
It's my lucky day.

16:19.600 --> 16:23.100
Yeah, lucky.
Well, that's one way of lookin' at it.

16:23.929 --> 16:27.000
But not the only way... Right, Talbot?

16:28.256 --> 16:30.635
There isn't anything sacred with you,
is there, Manning?

16:31.000 --> 16:32.400
Warm, dry feet.

16:41.900 --> 16:43.400
How'd you manage to get out, Manning?

16:44.400 --> 16:46.368
Did you get cut off from
the rest of the platoon?

16:47.000 --> 16:49.600
Trees get pretty thick out there?
Did you get lost?

16:51.862 --> 16:53.100
Come on, what happened?

16:53.826 --> 16:56.300
You got somethin' in that vat of yours,
just spill it.

16:57.336 --> 16:59.280
All right. Look, it's like this.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.894
See, your routine
isn't as seamless as you think it is.

17:02.139 --> 17:05.599
Always hangin' back a little bit,
never volunteering.

17:06.099 --> 17:10.700
Doing just enough to keep outta trouble,
but never enough to really help out.

17:12.099 --> 17:14.200
I'm kind of an emotional guy.

17:15.728 --> 17:19.721
Get one thing fuckin' straight, man.
There is no hangback now.

17:20.534 --> 17:23.099
You got a glob of greenies lookin'
at you to keep 'em alive,

17:23.300 --> 17:26.400
and if i find out that one
of them answers the last muster 'cause

17:26.520 --> 17:27.900
of your yellow streak,

17:28.249 --> 17:30.750
I will personally put a bullet
in your brain.

17:57.451 --> 17:58.648
Hey, Sandy!

18:00.200 --> 18:02.376
Hey, hey, hey! There he is!
- Hey!

18:02.496 --> 18:05.100
All right! You made it!

18:05.300 --> 18:07.000
Where the hell'd you go,
I looked for you.

18:07.100 --> 18:07.950
I got lost.

18:08.196 --> 18:09.162
I thought you chickened out.

18:09.282 --> 18:10.267
You thought he chickened out. Me,

18:10.387 --> 18:12.784
I know he's just a dumb fuck farmer
from Wisconsin.

18:13.900 --> 18:15.000
Am I in trouble?

18:15.200 --> 18:16.700
Hell no, we're still waitin'
for the sergeant.

18:16.800 --> 18:17.600
How'd you get here?

18:17.800 --> 18:21.325
Guy about a mile back in a jeep
just told me to follow the road.

18:21.632 --> 18:22.568
Still don't know why
they sent us in here,

18:22.688 --> 18:24.655
I hear the war's gonna
be over by Christmas.

18:24.901 --> 18:26.742
Who told you that shit?
- It's talk.

18:27.034 --> 18:29.800
I heard the Krauts got nothin'
but old men and children on the line.

18:30.100 --> 18:31.100
And you believe that?

18:31.500 --> 18:32.600
I'd like to.

18:33.500 --> 18:34.400
How 'bout you, Sandy,

18:34.520 --> 18:35.699
you believe that shit
about old men and kids?

18:35.819 --> 18:37.500
I will if you will.

18:38.907 --> 18:40.700
What are these?

18:41.976 --> 18:43.434
How the fuck should we know?

18:46.400 --> 18:52.500
They're called Dragon's Teeth.
Krauts use 'em to stop our tanks.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.567
You're standing on the Siegfried line.

18:57.100 --> 19:01.500
Over there is Germany.
I suggest your remember that.

19:07.539 --> 19:10.393
Let's go. You're with me.

19:11.175 --> 19:13.063
We're goin' to the front.

20:37.200 --> 20:40.900
All right, listen up.
Right over that hill is the front line.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.400
When you're in your foxholes,

20:44.600 --> 20:47.000
the Krauts are gonna be less
than fifty yards away.

20:47.300 --> 20:49.400
This is a thin line.

20:49.800 --> 20:52.000
Which means
we're gonna be spaced far apart.

20:52.600 --> 20:56.600
Because in this fog,
you might not see the guy nearest you.

20:57.300 --> 20:59.261
The Krauts are gonna hear us moving
into position,

20:59.381 --> 21:01.300
and they know that you're replacements.

21:01.400 --> 21:02.349
How?

21:02.800 --> 21:04.514
This company lost over
a hundred men last night.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.600
They know we're hurtin' bad,

21:06.800 --> 21:09.500
and they know that we have to try
to bring in replacements today.

21:10.700 --> 21:12.300
The only reason
they're not makin' a push,

21:12.500 --> 21:14.300
is because they're hurtin' too.

21:14.700 --> 21:18.417
They know you guys don't know shit.
They're gonna try to use it.

21:19.600 --> 21:23.282
They'll call out to you in English,
they'll try to spook ya.

21:24.200 --> 21:27.931
The main thing you need to do
is keep your shit together.

21:29.182 --> 21:31.468
This is the real fuckin' deal.

21:34.061 --> 21:34.982
Name.

21:35.102 --> 21:36.056
Huh?

21:36.176 --> 21:37.990
Your name.
- Warren.

21:38.110 --> 21:39.200
Last name.

21:39.500 --> 21:40.712
Sanderson.

21:41.400 --> 21:47.000
Sanderson, you're first.
You stay right behind me.

21:47.120 --> 21:47.986
Okay.

21:48.278 --> 21:50.300
I'll be back for each of you,
one at time.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.700
Don't go wandering off now.

21:54.800 --> 21:57.635
I mean it. Stay right in my back pocket.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.000
Let's go.

22:43.122 --> 22:44.887
Keep your fuckin' head down!

22:57.149 --> 22:58.485
Move him out.

23:04.531 --> 23:06.418
Sure took your sweet time gettin' here.

23:08.255 --> 23:09.866
Anything notable?

23:10.633 --> 23:11.953
Those fucking tanks again.

23:12.628 --> 23:14.187
They've been jammin'
their barrels down our throat

23:14.307 --> 23:16.500
from that fuckin' high ground
for a week now.

23:17.017 --> 23:19.260
Air Corps can't see 'em,
artillery can't hit 'em.

23:19.380 --> 23:20.181
They better find some way

23:20.301 --> 23:22.421
of knockin' those fuckers out
and I mean fast.

23:23.112 --> 23:24.278
What about the 88s?

23:24.554 --> 23:25.736
They're still out there.

23:26.025 --> 23:30.400
Tanks on our right side, 88
millimeter cannons on our left side.

23:32.635 --> 23:33.709
Fuckin' Army.

23:35.209 --> 23:36.513
Fuckin' Army.

23:39.997 --> 23:42.490
I'll be back, in the morning,
for patrol.

23:54.311 --> 23:55.661
Scared?
- Huh?

23:57.200 --> 23:58.086
Scared?

23:59.359 --> 24:00.648
Yeah.

24:02.543 --> 24:04.262
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

24:06.410 --> 24:09.004
Want me to tell ya?
- Okay.

24:09.525 --> 24:11.981
Basically, you're a lookout.

24:12.242 --> 24:13.223
When you're down in here,

24:13.499 --> 24:16.722
you're responsible for holding
this section of the line. Okay?

24:16.842 --> 24:19.775
You got a machine gun nest protecting
you on your right flank,

24:19.895 --> 24:21.218
twenty-five yards away.

24:21.338 --> 24:24.082
You got another rifleman protecting
you on your left flank,

24:24.202 --> 24:27.735
a little closer, maybe fifteen,
twenty yards, okay? - Okay.

24:28.011 --> 24:30.236
Now, in front of you,
you got your Krauts.

24:31.233 --> 24:34.594
They're close.
Thirty yards, maybe a little more.

24:34.993 --> 24:36.773
The challenge is ''Hershey.''

24:36.893 --> 24:39.404
The password is ''apple.'' Okay?

24:39.772 --> 24:41.570
You say ''Hershey''
and you don't hear ''apple,''

24:41.690 --> 24:43.378
you open fire, you understand?

24:43.498 --> 24:45.281
You don't think about it,
you don't hesitate,

24:45.401 --> 24:47.123
you just do it, you understand?

24:47.414 --> 24:50.342
Otherwise, you're gonna go home
to your mama in a box, all right?

24:51.110 --> 24:53.611
Now them Krauts make a push,
you use your grenade.

24:53.949 --> 24:55.759
Okay, how do I know
if they're makin' a push?

24:57.980 --> 24:59.376
You hear a whole bunch
of shootin' and screamin',

24:59.496 --> 25:01.233
and a bunch of guys runnin' at ya...

25:01.586 --> 25:02.645
Yeah?

25:03.851 --> 25:05.646
Then you know they're makin' a push.

25:07.088 --> 25:08.393
Oh, yeah.

25:09.850 --> 25:12.229
Oh, yeah, you wanna light up
a cigarette at night,

25:12.349 --> 25:13.779
lay on your back at the bottom
of the hole.

25:13.899 --> 25:15.359
I don't smoke.
- Huh?

25:15.681 --> 25:16.587
I don't smoke.

25:18.493 --> 25:19.798
You still got your issues?

25:20.151 --> 25:20.995
Yeah?

25:21.562 --> 25:22.683
You will.

25:30.700 --> 25:31.746
What's your name?

25:32.360 --> 25:33.557
Warren.

25:34.431 --> 25:36.518
Welcome to Death Factory, Warren.

27:37.343 --> 27:40.043
You got point.
I've got you on a straight line course.

27:40.163 --> 27:42.726
I know this is your first patrol.

27:43.312 --> 27:45.227
You've had time
to watch what I've been doin'.

27:45.549 --> 27:46.271
Yeah.

27:47.130 --> 27:48.051
Be alert.

27:48.678 --> 27:51.671
You've been behind Kraut lines
for the last thirty yards or so.

27:52.469 --> 27:53.804
You got no friends here.

27:54.233 --> 27:57.285
Our job is to scout the enemy positions.

27:59.955 --> 28:03.101
Ease up on the trigger finger.

28:03.899 --> 28:04.865
Yeah, right.

28:05.249 --> 28:06.483
This is your first big chance
to stay alive,

28:06.603 --> 28:08.171
don't fuck it up.

28:09.796 --> 28:11.072
Let's go.

29:00.570 --> 29:02.473
Slow down, Sandy, slow down.

29:04.473 --> 29:05.455
Slow down.

29:07.113 --> 29:08.018
Sandy!

29:29.959 --> 29:32.000
What's goin' on?
- I lost Sandy!

29:39.932 --> 29:41.344
Get down, get down!

29:49.301 --> 29:50.344
What's goin' on?

29:50.667 --> 29:51.548
We lost Sanderson.

29:51.668 --> 29:52.539
What's this ''we'' crap?

29:52.659 --> 29:53.475
Shut up!

29:55.408 --> 29:56.160
What do we do, Sarge?

29:56.498 --> 29:57.465
We wait.

29:59.513 --> 30:01.415
I hope he's got brains enough
to come straight back.

30:01.661 --> 30:03.533
What if he doesn't know he's alone?

30:04.392 --> 30:05.574
He knows.

32:32.644 --> 32:34.179
All right, we're headin' back.

32:34.762 --> 32:36.020
We're just gonna leave him out here?

32:36.419 --> 32:38.475
Can't afford to risk the entire squad.

32:38.767 --> 32:39.695
Yeah, but...

32:40.002 --> 32:41.030
What is your name?

32:41.951 --> 32:44.176
Doug... Despin.

32:44.974 --> 32:46.278
Well, Doug Despin,

32:46.398 --> 32:49.184
this is the second time
I'm tellin' you to shut up.

32:50.182 --> 32:51.256
You follow me?

32:51.747 --> 32:54.497
Yeah.
- Then, let's go.

33:03.327 --> 33:04.310
Warren!

33:45.291 --> 33:48.836
Afternoon, gentlemen.
We're gonna make another push.

33:49.281 --> 33:50.978
The objective is to retake the town

33:51.098 --> 33:53.323
of Schmidt four miles east
of our present position.

33:53.645 --> 33:55.057
Not that that's a surprise.

33:55.656 --> 33:59.859
To get there, we have got to secure
the river crossing on the Kall Trail.

34:00.427 --> 34:03.066
Now we'll approach the river through
this part of the forest.

34:03.787 --> 34:06.810
Roy, your boys are gonna take
the Kall Trail again.

34:07.102 --> 34:10.014
You have got to take
and hold Arbaley Bridge.

34:11.764 --> 34:12.777
Yes, sir.

34:13.176 --> 34:17.105
Now G-2 said it'll be clear sailing up
to the bridge, but once you get there...

34:17.857 --> 34:19.203
it's gonna get pretty hot.

34:19.601 --> 34:20.281
With all due respect, sir,

34:20.400 --> 34:21.864
did G-2 forget about the tanks

34:21.984 --> 34:23.761
the Jerries
have been clobbering us with?

34:24.022 --> 34:26.462
No. The artillery's gonna take care
of the tanks.

34:26.723 --> 34:28.027
They've been saying that for a week.

34:28.303 --> 34:30.753
Well, they're saying it again,
and this time they're right.

34:30.873 --> 34:31.699
Bunch of chickenshits...

34:31.800 --> 34:33.116
Do you have a problem, Captain?

34:33.235 --> 34:35.170
What if those tanks
are still firing, sir?

34:35.690 --> 34:37.025
Then we'll deal with it.

34:37.364 --> 34:38.510
No problem.

34:39.154 --> 34:39.725
Captain Pritchett,

34:39.844 --> 34:42.530
if you feel you're unable
to carry out your orders, you let me know.

34:42.868 --> 34:45.722
And I'll relieve you of your command
and find somebody who can.

34:49.011 --> 34:51.054
Now the jumping off point's
the Siegfried line here,

34:51.175 --> 34:52.157
here and here.

34:52.556 --> 34:53.893
There's not gonna be
an opening barrage this time,

34:54.014 --> 34:55.349
I want surprise.

34:56.391 --> 34:58.802
You men will take
and hold your objectives.

34:59.308 --> 35:01.564
We've been screwing
around too damn long up here.

35:01.901 --> 35:03.000
Any questions?

35:07.196 --> 35:08.838
Any questions, Captain?

35:10.096 --> 35:10.848
No, sir.

35:12.291 --> 35:13.303
Thank you.

35:14.470 --> 35:15.820
Good day, gentlemen.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.569
Hey, Sandy, you gonna eat that?

35:49.579 --> 35:50.600
Leave it alone!

35:51.644 --> 35:53.600
You want more, you go wait in line.

35:56.861 --> 35:58.304
Sanderson, eat your food!

35:59.178 --> 36:00.268
I'm not hungry.

36:01.502 --> 36:02.760
That's not the point.

36:03.514 --> 36:04.833
I'm not hungry.

36:13.816 --> 36:16.041
Last time I had
a hot meal was five days ago.

36:17.377 --> 36:19.712
Since then,
my entire platoon has been wiped out.

36:21.400 --> 36:22.750
That's why you're here.

36:23.867 --> 36:25.816
You're just a bunch of guys
in line to get shot,

36:26.215 --> 36:27.900
so they can bring in a bunch
of other guys.

36:29.100 --> 36:30.400
See how that works?

36:32.460 --> 36:34.580
Now, once you get
that through your fuckin' head,

36:35.241 --> 36:37.573
maybe you'll realize how important
a hot meal could be.

36:41.487 --> 36:43.036
Don't go anywhere.

36:47.068 --> 36:49.005
Stay where I can find you,
we're makin' a push.

36:49.125 --> 36:50.229
We get orders, Sarge?

36:51.166 --> 36:52.600
We will.

36:53.790 --> 36:55.800
Well, if we didn't get orders,
how do you know we're makin' a push?

36:58.487 --> 37:04.625
Hot food, coffee, cigarettes.
We're making a push, sure as shit.

37:12.825 --> 37:13.914
He's full of it!

37:16.492 --> 37:17.944
Do you think he's full of it?

37:22.947 --> 37:24.100
He's full of it!

37:26.031 --> 37:27.600
When'd you start smokin'?

37:28.100 --> 37:29.400
What's it to you?

37:29.600 --> 37:31.000
Sorry I blew up.

37:32.300 --> 37:33.100
Shut up.

37:33.472 --> 37:34.672
Come on, Baxter, relax.

37:34.792 --> 37:37.293
Last night for me.
I bet you lit up, Warren.

37:39.173 --> 37:40.699
My first day.
- Me, too.

37:41.091 --> 37:42.488
I was freezing.

37:45.112 --> 37:48.450
Hey... check this out.

37:48.570 --> 37:49.890
What the fuck you doin', Lonnie?

37:50.780 --> 37:53.097
You fart, I'm gonna blow your ass off.

37:58.189 --> 38:00.015
Only assholes smoke.

38:03.667 --> 38:04.600
Cigarette?

38:09.971 --> 38:12.058
Problem with these issues,
they taste like shit.

38:17.633 --> 38:19.000
Hey, Sanderson.

38:21.653 --> 38:26.410
Out there in the woods with the Krauts,
what was it like?

38:32.149 --> 38:37.053
It was like... drowning.

38:46.837 --> 38:48.000
You wanted to speak to me?

38:49.937 --> 38:50.900
Lieutenant?!

38:56.031 --> 38:59.100
I wanna know what happened out
on that patrol yesterday.

39:01.744 --> 39:05.100
I heard your point man got separated
from the squad.

39:05.503 --> 39:06.580
They're still learning.

39:06.700 --> 39:07.667
No shit.

39:08.127 --> 39:11.061
What the fuck are you thinkin'
putting replacement at point

39:11.181 --> 39:12.400
on his first patrol?!

39:12.757 --> 39:14.463
I've got nothing but replacements.

39:14.583 --> 39:16.700
You shoulda stayed at point, Sergeant.

39:18.551 --> 39:19.748
Sergeant!

39:21.743 --> 39:24.400
I thought it would be a perfect chance
for at least one

39:24.500 --> 39:26.241
of them to get some experience.

39:26.361 --> 39:27.300
Bullshit!

39:27.420 --> 39:29.453
You're still trying
to save your own ass!

39:29.573 --> 39:31.000
These kids don't know anything!

39:31.445 --> 39:32.519
And you do?

39:33.609 --> 39:37.100
No. I don't.

39:39.074 --> 39:40.010
For four days...

39:40.563 --> 39:44.000
I've been watching these mangled
bodies being carried out of the woods,

39:44.120 --> 39:48.500
knowing real soon I'm gonna be expected
to lead a platoon in there.

39:48.949 --> 39:50.837
Nobody's telling me a goddamned thing.

39:50.957 --> 39:53.261
I just walk around,
trying to look like a lieutenant,

39:53.507 --> 39:54.500
so, you're right.

39:55.011 --> 39:56.300
I don't know anything.

39:56.760 --> 39:57.700
In fact,

39:58.417 --> 40:02.700
the only one in this platoon
who does... is you.

40:04.824 --> 40:08.875
Do you get it now?
Is it starting to sink in?

40:09.919 --> 40:11.100
What do you want?

40:11.466 --> 40:13.845
I want your help!

40:17.712 --> 40:22.680
Look, if I can help you in any way
without endangering my own life,

40:22.800 --> 40:24.100
I won't hesitate.

40:24.459 --> 40:26.899
If you want my opinion,
I'll give it to ya.

40:27.190 --> 40:29.400
But I'm not takin' a bullet for anybody.

40:30.382 --> 40:32.000
That's not good enough.

40:32.285 --> 40:33.700
That's as good as it gets.

40:42.400 --> 40:43.900
I'll tell ya what, Dave.

40:44.448 --> 40:46.700
You find yourself out there
in the middle of a fire fight...

40:47.042 --> 40:50.100
with your guts hangin' out,
screamin' for a medic.

40:51.093 --> 40:54.162
If I can help you in any way
without endangering my own life,

40:55.220 --> 40:56.600
I won't hesitate.

41:05.717 --> 41:06.900
So what do ya think?

41:08.725 --> 41:09.589
About what?

41:11.538 --> 41:15.400
This push that Manning's talking about.
You think we're really gonna do it?

41:16.157 --> 41:17.100
Yeah.

41:20.999 --> 41:22.150
We just got here.

41:23.178 --> 41:24.406
Yeah.

41:29.109 --> 41:36.500
Hey, Sandy... Yesterday out in the woods,
Manning was just gonna leave you there.

41:44.500 --> 41:46.500
I think we're all gonna die out here.

42:12.300 --> 42:17.581
Lord of my salvation,
that saves me... for He is my shield.

42:21.528 --> 42:26.883
Saves me from my enemies
and inequities...

42:29.036 --> 42:30.084
We'll go in two minutes.

42:30.816 --> 42:31.542
Sir.

42:37.431 --> 42:38.582
Two minutes.

42:44.543 --> 42:45.500
Two minutes.

42:49.177 --> 42:52.000
Two minutes, and nobody dies.

42:53.900 --> 42:55.900
Two minutes. Nobody dies.

42:58.590 --> 43:00.804
Two minutes. Nobody dies.

43:01.064 --> 43:02.952
Say it, Lonnie, you gotta say it!

43:03.320 --> 43:04.287
Nobody dies.

43:04.671 --> 43:05.683
Nobody dies.

43:07.571 --> 43:09.000
Nobody dies.

45:50.604 --> 45:53.965
Fire!... Fire!

45:55.622 --> 45:57.880
Move! Go! Keep moving!

45:58.000 --> 45:59.730
Spread out!... Spread out!

46:00.865 --> 46:02.016
Don't bunch!

46:02.446 --> 46:05.116
Don't bunch!
- Don't bunch!

46:06.391 --> 46:07.250
Sergeant!

46:07.756 --> 46:08.846
Move it! Move it!

46:11.014 --> 46:12.303
Ahh!

46:21.704 --> 46:23.592
Spread out! Spread out!

46:24.129 --> 46:25.157
Don't bunch.

46:39.726 --> 46:47.419
Get off me! Get off me! Get off me!
Get off me! Get off me!

46:48.232 --> 46:49.322
Fire!

46:55.087 --> 47:00.643
No! No! Go back! Go back!
Back, back! Come on!

47:00.889 --> 47:02.945
Come on. Go, go, go, go!

47:03.259 --> 47:08.600
Go. Stay together! Back! Back! Back!

47:09.259 --> 47:10.400
Fire!

47:10.993 --> 47:12.800
Go back!

47:13.915 --> 47:17.076
Medic! Get back!

47:18.743 --> 47:21.500
Medic! Medic!

48:11.543 --> 48:12.325
What?

48:14.136 --> 48:15.394
We're makin' another push.

48:15.670 --> 48:17.128
You gotta be shittin' me.

48:17.481 --> 48:20.000
Our company is to try to take
the bridge on the Kall Trail again

48:20.200 --> 48:21.300
and hold it.

48:22.590 --> 48:23.974
Kraut 88's on the ridge
are gonna have us right

48:24.094 --> 48:25.110
on the chopping block.

48:25.230 --> 48:26.227
Fuckers.

48:27.884 --> 48:29.751
There's a road leadin' up the ridge
from the north side.

48:29.871 --> 48:31.316
I figure a single squad with a couple

48:31.436 --> 48:34.247
of flame throwers might
have a shot at takin' 'em out.

48:34.367 --> 48:35.978
Their gun crews'll be firing at us.

48:37.420 --> 48:39.032
What about their infantry support?

48:39.988 --> 48:42.735
Krauts are holding their manpower back
about a mile behind the bridge.

48:43.793 --> 48:45.098
Apparently they're havin'
trouble finding replacements,

48:45.218 --> 48:47.461
so they're relying on their 88s
to wipe us out.

48:49.425 --> 48:51.100
I need a squad to volunteer.

48:52.879 --> 48:54.981
Good luck.

48:56.408 --> 48:57.516
You take out those guns

48:57.636 --> 49:00.336
and I'll get you that Section 8
you were beggin' for.

49:11.532 --> 49:12.700
It's a deal.

49:21.843 --> 49:25.495
You smile at me again
and I'll kick your teeth out!

49:44.939 --> 49:46.919
Medic! Medic!

50:02.170 --> 50:03.398
Fire!

50:06.300 --> 50:07.173
Fire!

50:18.417 --> 50:19.491
Fire!

50:35.336 --> 50:36.580
This is Pritchett, sir.

50:36.700 --> 50:39.065
We've got the bridge,
but we're getting our asses reamed!

50:51.808 --> 50:52.837
Fire!

50:54.862 --> 50:56.373
Fire!

50:59.063 --> 51:00.000
Fire!

51:57.351 --> 51:58.471
Fire!

52:02.564 --> 52:03.730
Fire!

52:09.360 --> 52:11.400
Sir, request permission to pull back.

52:11.846 --> 52:14.000
Negative. Do not pull back.

52:14.271 --> 52:15.731
My men are getting cut
to pieces up here,

52:15.851 --> 52:16.910
we're pullin' back!

52:17.400 --> 52:20.500
You hold that bridge, Captain!
That's an order!

52:21.022 --> 52:23.400
I've already lost thirty men!

52:23.892 --> 52:27.700
This isn't a debate, Pritchett!
You hold that goddamn bridge!

52:28.000 --> 52:29.700
This is suicide!

52:38.700 --> 52:39.900
Lieutenant!

52:40.100 --> 52:41.700
We're dead meat here, Lieutenant!

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
God damn it, Lieutenant, fuckin' move!

52:49.357 --> 52:50.400
Fire!

52:52.000 --> 52:53.100
Fire!

53:13.100 --> 53:14.400
All right, listen up.

53:14.800 --> 53:17.000
As far as I can see
they have no infantry support.

53:17.500 --> 53:19.200
The gun crew's got its back to us.

53:22.400 --> 53:24.500
We're gonna run right up that road.

53:24.700 --> 53:30.179
Baxter, Sanderson,
you're gonna burn 'em out... Okay?

53:33.800 --> 53:34.900
Let's move.

53:37.500 --> 53:38.800
Fire!

53:43.800 --> 53:44.700
Fire!

53:48.500 --> 53:51.000
Boxcar 6, this is Boxcar 9, over!

53:51.500 --> 53:52.700
Boxcar 6, over.

53:53.100 --> 53:55.700
This is Sergeant Talbot.
Lieutenant Lukas has lost it!

54:00.000 --> 54:02.100
That puts you in charge over this,
Sergeant. Now listen up.

54:02.300 --> 54:04.500
You gotta pull your platoon back to
this side of the river!

54:04.900 --> 54:07.224
You expect me to get these guys
to leave cover in this shit?!

54:07.344 --> 54:08.728
If you don't get that platoon to move,

54:08.848 --> 54:10.324
you're all gonna be dead
in ten minutes.

54:10.444 --> 54:11.720
Now haul ass!

54:45.600 --> 54:47.000
Fire!

54:48.600 --> 54:49.900
Fire!

55:45.713 --> 55:47.033
Baxter!

55:47.739 --> 55:50.532
No, no, no, no fucking way,
no fucking way, no fucking way!

55:50.869 --> 55:51.805
Baxter!

55:53.072 --> 55:56.233
No! No fucking way! No fucking way!
No fucking way!

56:05.089 --> 56:06.623
No! No!

56:06.743 --> 56:08.357
Get up there, Baxter!

56:28.071 --> 56:30.680
Stay where you are! Hold your position!

56:32.184 --> 56:33.530
Baxter!

56:34.696 --> 56:35.924
God damn you.

56:38.487 --> 56:40.819
No! No! No!

56:44.658 --> 56:46.652
What the fuck are you doing?

56:51.747 --> 56:53.466
Jesus Christ!

57:00.445 --> 57:02.992
Warren! Get up there now!

57:15.985 --> 57:17.059
Back up!

57:17.780 --> 57:20.113
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

58:33.500 --> 58:34.517
He did it.

58:57.925 --> 58:59.858
I'll be a son of a bitch!

59:15.893 --> 59:18.686
Easy now... Easy.

59:28.291 --> 59:30.209
Hey, Lieutenant...

59:55.934 --> 59:57.530
Tank!

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:09.266
Take cover, get back!
Back to the trees, men! Pull back!

01:00:16.008 --> 01:00:17.189
Pull back!

01:01:02.604 --> 01:01:04.055
It's not over till we're out of here.

01:01:04.175 --> 01:01:05.006
Take the torch off!

01:01:07.308 --> 01:01:08.474
Go! Go!

01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:11.727
Go!

01:01:45.059 --> 01:01:46.026
Fuck!

01:01:57.651 --> 01:02:00.797
Lonnie! Lonnie!

01:02:05.231 --> 01:02:07.333
No! No!

01:02:33.897 --> 01:02:39.406
Come on! Come on! Keep movin'!
Come on! No! Fuck!

01:02:41.231 --> 01:02:43.487
Lonnie, come on, come on, come on!

01:02:43.779 --> 01:02:48.980
You gotta keep movin', keep movin',
keep movin'! Come on! Come on! Come on!

01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:54.499
He's dead! He's dead! Go! Go!

01:02:56.371 --> 01:02:57.630
Let's go!

01:04:43.330 --> 01:04:44.700
How you doin', Roy?

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:46.445
I'm fine, sir. I could stay.

01:04:46.752 --> 01:04:48.100
I think you need a rest.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Everybody here needs a rest, sir.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.783
Captain, this conversation was over
the first time we ever had it,

01:04:53.903 --> 01:04:55.300
and it's just as over now.

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:57.524
You're wounded, you need a rest.

01:04:58.107 --> 01:05:00.332
Fresh point of view may
help break things open here, Roy.

01:05:00.593 --> 01:05:01.759
Do I know you?

01:05:02.051 --> 01:05:03.324
Your people inside?

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:06.000
Yes, sir.

01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:09.486
Captain Zanuck, may I suggest
that you take this time to go in

01:05:09.606 --> 01:05:11.312
and acquaint yourself with your team.

01:05:11.432 --> 01:05:12.448
Sir.

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.410
I should be involved
with that briefing, sir.

01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:17.500
The Captain will need every bit
of advice he can get.

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:18.971
Negative.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:23.206
I don't want
the same mistakes as before.

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:25.500
What mistakes are those?

01:05:28.598 --> 01:05:29.657
You tell me.

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:36.613
Driver! This man needs a doctor.

01:06:07.872 --> 01:06:09.283
That was a rough one, huh?

01:06:11.248 --> 01:06:12.521
Rough one.

01:06:14.424 --> 01:06:15.805
Where's your squad?

01:06:18.811 --> 01:06:20.284
Over there.

01:06:26.668 --> 01:06:28.034
Was it worth it?

01:06:29.438 --> 01:06:30.497
What?

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:32.400
The Section 8.

01:06:35.898 --> 01:06:37.483
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

01:06:38.127 --> 01:06:40.874
You really are a fuckin' piece of shit,
aren't you, Manning?

01:06:42.009 --> 01:06:44.388
That's right, Talbot.
I'm a piece of shit.

01:06:45.201 --> 01:06:47.010
So you went up that ridge
with four other guys

01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:48.054
and came back with one, huh?

01:06:48.174 --> 01:06:49.542
You weren't fuckin' there.

01:06:50.939 --> 01:06:52.182
Yeah, lucky for me.

01:06:57.118 --> 01:06:58.959
I been keepin' an eye on you, Manning.

01:06:59.466 --> 01:07:00.647
Oh, yeah?

01:07:02.581 --> 01:07:05.558
We all know about that Section 8 deal
you cut with Pritchett.

01:07:08.869 --> 01:07:10.803
Anything to save your own ass.

01:07:11.278 --> 01:07:12.322
That's right.

01:07:16.304 --> 01:07:18.851
It's too bad he won't be around
to hold up his end of the deal.

01:07:23.885 --> 01:07:25.312
What are you talkin' about?

01:07:25.833 --> 01:07:28.794
He got wounded.
They took him off the line today.

01:07:35.274 --> 01:07:37.019
Life's a bitch, ain't it?

01:08:04.433 --> 01:08:05.983
Where's Lieutenant Lukas?

01:08:06.551 --> 01:08:09.098
Nobody knows, sir.
It's been pretty hard on him.

01:08:09.451 --> 01:08:10.571
Is that him?

01:08:12.082 --> 01:08:13.187
Yes, sir.

01:08:15.427 --> 01:08:17.421
What's the status of your platoon,
Lieutenant?

01:08:18.036 --> 01:08:18.926
Huh?

01:08:29.694 --> 01:08:33.223
Whatever your problem is, Lieutenant,
I suggest you get it under control!

01:08:39.354 --> 01:08:41.319
Pull it together, Lieutenant, now!

01:08:50.357 --> 01:08:51.140
Get off of me!

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:52.321
Let's go!

01:08:52.874 --> 01:08:54.117
Get him outta here!

01:08:57.584 --> 01:08:59.163
God damn it!

01:09:14.406 --> 01:09:16.693
You wanted to know
the status of his platoon?

01:09:19.424 --> 01:09:20.759
Just a minute, soldier...

01:09:21.787 --> 01:09:24.304
You're treadin' dangerously close
to a courtmartial!

01:09:24.956 --> 01:09:27.810
That gets me outta here, right... sir?

01:09:28.133 --> 01:09:29.299
You're Manning, aren't you?

01:09:29.591 --> 01:09:30.649
What do you care?

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:34.286
Report to my command post immediately.

01:09:51.206 --> 01:09:52.679
Sergeant David Manning.

01:09:53.231 --> 01:09:55.119
You have a sheet on everybody?

01:09:57.311 --> 01:09:59.858
Not right now, Sergeant, just you.

01:10:00.809 --> 01:10:03.300
Sergeant Manning has
an excellent innate understanding

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.000
of battlefield conditions.

01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:08.200
His ability to react
to aggressive situations

01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:10.451
is unmatched by anybody in the company.

01:10:10.571 --> 01:10:14.042
His disrespect for authority is unable
to hide his ability to lead.

01:10:14.456 --> 01:10:16.599
I strongly suggest that
he be considered

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:19.900
for the next platoon leader when
and if the situation presents itself.

01:10:22.366 --> 01:10:24.161
Captain Roy Pritchett.

01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:31.712
If I'm not mistaken, Sergeant,
the situation has presented itself.

01:10:37.207 --> 01:10:38.618
When was that written?

01:10:40.782 --> 01:10:42.531
The day you were made Sergeant.

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.600
Sir, I'm a non-com.

01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:51.900
I know what you are, Manning.

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.629
And I also know
what you capabilities are.

01:10:55.997 --> 01:10:59.358
I was a private three days ago.

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:05.900
This isn't up for discussion,
Lieutenant.

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:10.800
You've got no choice in this.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.546
And as it is... neither do I.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:33.576
At 0800 we're makin' another push.
Get your people together, Lieutenant.

01:11:34.666 --> 01:11:36.446
I got nothin' left.

01:11:38.657 --> 01:11:40.483
Dig a little deeper.

01:11:52.184 --> 01:11:57.064
He's over there! Manning?
- Hey!

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:03.000
We wanna talk to ya.
I said we wanna talk, asshole!

01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:06.200
Look, I wanna know the truth, Manning,
what the hell happened out there.

01:12:06.649 --> 01:12:08.276
Don't you fuckin' walk away from me.

01:12:08.905 --> 01:12:11.713
Hey... come on. Stop! Come on!

01:12:15.694 --> 01:12:17.290
You executed Baxter!

01:12:17.627 --> 01:12:18.610
You're damn right I did.

01:12:18.932 --> 01:12:20.700
He ran, you'd have done the same thing.

01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:21.786
Put the gun down, Talbot!

01:12:21.906 --> 01:12:22.900
Shut up!

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:28.800
Go ahead. We're all dead anyway.
Regiment's making a push tomorrow.

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:30.278
We're to take Schmidt at all costs.

01:12:30.539 --> 01:12:31.214
What?

01:12:31.334 --> 01:12:32.413
You heard me.

01:12:33.625 --> 01:12:35.052
Jesus!

01:12:44.856 --> 01:12:47.000
The way I see it, we've got two choices.

01:12:47.587 --> 01:12:50.380
We can settle for being slaughtered
in the push tomorrow,

01:12:51.485 --> 01:12:53.500
or we can take those tanks out tonight.

01:12:54.105 --> 01:12:56.300
There's no way
in hell Company'll approve that.

01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:59.998
This isn't about Company.
If we do it, it's just us.

01:13:01.149 --> 01:13:05.568
We'll slip past the lines unchecked.
Just another sorry-ass patrol.

01:13:05.829 --> 01:13:06.719
Let me get this straight.

01:13:06.839 --> 01:13:08.483
Yesterday you were pulling
for a Section 8.

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:12.158
Now, you wanna lead
some kind of renegade force

01:13:12.278 --> 01:13:13.631
against the German tanks.

01:13:14.721 --> 01:13:17.176
The question is,
''How do we stay alive?''

01:13:20.045 --> 01:13:22.102
What you think
of me doesn't really matter.

01:13:26.069 --> 01:13:27.496
What's your plan, Manning?

01:13:27.773 --> 01:13:29.399
You're not taking this shit seriously?

01:13:30.243 --> 01:13:31.563
Maybe.

01:13:31.962 --> 01:13:33.450
Well, who's to say
he's not gonna shoot you

01:13:33.570 --> 01:13:34.617
in the back like he did Baxter?

01:13:34.737 --> 01:13:36.090
He didn't have a choice.

01:13:41.511 --> 01:13:43.813
If he hadn't shot Baxter,
we all would've run.

01:13:44.687 --> 01:13:47.296
And we'd still be taking
the fire from those 88s.

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:54.455
I'll go with you.

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:05.000
I don't know, I don't know.

01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:07.183
Look, if anyone can do this,
I think it's him.

01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:12.800
I'm not thrilled about the odds.

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:14.832
But it's better than what
we got comin' at dawn.

01:14:16.213 --> 01:14:17.272
Manning.

01:14:17.732 --> 01:14:18.699
What?

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:21.752
Nobody dies.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.226
Nobody dies.

01:14:29.613 --> 01:14:31.132
Let's just get it done.

01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:34.664
All right.

01:14:34.784 --> 01:14:36.900
I'll clear the mine field
and cut the wire.

01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:41.800
We gotta hit the tanks at dawn,
before the push begins.

01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:55.985
All right... no turnin' back.

01:22:48.788 --> 01:22:49.831
Let's go.

01:23:14.502 --> 01:23:21.745
All right.
I'm goin' for the truck... Cover me.

01:24:59.618 --> 01:25:00.416
Go!

01:25:14.441 --> 01:25:15.362
Up!

01:25:56.352 --> 01:25:57.579
Manning!

01:25:59.942 --> 01:26:01.569
No!

01:26:06.387 --> 01:26:07.906
Chamberlain!

01:27:40.655 --> 01:27:43.604
I'm not gonna make it.
I'm losing too much blood.

01:27:43.724 --> 01:27:45.013
You're gonna make it!

01:27:45.741 --> 01:27:46.854
You're an idiot!

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.016
You're gonna owe me big, Lieutenant.

01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:55.800
I ain't gonna owe you shit!

01:27:56.793 --> 01:27:59.064
Less than a mile, okay?
Less than a mile!

01:27:59.939 --> 01:28:01.151
It's too far!

01:28:01.550 --> 01:28:02.800
It's not too far!

01:28:09.791 --> 01:28:11.157
What's so funny?

01:28:12.994 --> 01:28:13.900
You.

01:28:14.268 --> 01:28:15.388
Me, what?

01:28:16.999 --> 01:28:18.100
Forget it.

01:28:19.301 --> 01:28:20.928
I'm takin' you home, Dave.

01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:24.021
Sure.

01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:26.046
You're goin' home.
