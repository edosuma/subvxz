When you find him,

04:47.211 --> 04:49.752
- It's not good.

04:49.835 --> 04:52.752
We're pulling what we can
off the recovered
host control units.

04:52.835 --> 04:55.294
But what's really unsettling

04:55.378 --> 04:57.960
is what's in
about a third of them.

04:58.044 --> 05:00.919
- Nothing.

05:01.002 --> 05:04.710
- More like they're virgin.

05:04.794 --> 05:07.877
Like they never held data
to begin with.

05:07.960 --> 05:10.669

we can recover from the Cradle.

05:21.835 --> 05:24.336
The hosts' backups
have all been destroyed.

05:24.419 --> 05:27.710
So we've effectively lost
a third of our IP
in a single sweep.

05:33.794 --> 05:36.586
Well, that's quite a story
you gave them...

05:39.960 --> 05:42.336
...and one hell of an ending.

How did all
these disparate threads

05:47.544 --> 05:49.960
come together to create
this nightmare?

If we figure that out,
we'll know how the story turns.

06:36.211 --> 06:38.752
Does the saying
have a footnote about
fucking lassos, then?

06:38.835 --> 06:40.960
All right,
that's enough.

he's got one now...

Fuck me!

asshole.

We based this park
on Japan's Edo period

07:56.378 --> 07:59.002

of artful gore.

08:04.378 --> 08:06.044
This world will end badly,

08:06.127 --> 08:08.252
but I'll make sure
your end is worse!

08:15.002 --> 08:18.211

whispering in Japanese )

08:22.710 --> 08:24.544
You understand them?

08:24.628 --> 08:27.919
You all do. Look,
she's a Madam--

08:28.002 --> 08:29.877
consciously fluent
in dozens of languages,

08:29.960 --> 08:31.211
including Japanese.

08:31.294 --> 08:32.544
But you all have
those com skills

08:32.628 --> 08:34.044
buried somewhere
in your code.

08:41.169 --> 08:43.378
Lee:
The point is,

08:43.461 --> 08:44.877
the fact that
these psychos

08:44.960 --> 08:47.002
didn't flip to English
as soon as I opened my mouth

08:47.086 --> 08:49.628
means that the same
malfunctioning shitshow

08:49.710 --> 08:52.710
that's playing out in Westworld
has found its way here.

08:52.794 --> 08:55.835
That's also why
your vocal voodoo
didn't work on them--

08:55.919 --> 08:58.127
you spoke
the wrong language.

It's us.

11:10.586 --> 11:12.044
Lee:
Yes, fine,

11:12.127 --> 11:15.044

a little bit from Westworld.

11:15.127 --> 11:17.960

Sweetwater was never home
to begin with, Teddy.

15:01.835 --> 15:05.086
You and I were born long before
this place even existed.

15:05.169 --> 15:08.086
Teddy:
But it's the place
I return to again and again.

15:08.169 --> 15:10.586
No matter how far I strayed,

15:10.669 --> 15:14.461
somethin' always...
carried me back.

15:17.544 --> 15:19.669
Somethin' like that?

15:31.669 --> 15:34.794
Looks like
she's taken some hits
the past few days.

15:34.877 --> 15:36.710
But who hasn't?

15:50.752 --> 15:52.877
Make a thorough inspection

15:52.960 --> 15:55.461
from the engine
to the last axle.

15:55.544 --> 15:57.461
Fix what's broke,

15:57.544 --> 15:59.336
strip her for speed.

16:23.835 --> 16:26.252
What do we need
the train for, Dolores?

16:26.336 --> 16:28.044
They've taken my daddy.

16:30.211 --> 16:32.586
So we're gonna get him back.

16:44.794 --> 16:47.336
Well, it ain't doin' any good
sittin' in that bottle.

16:54.336 --> 16:56.044
New Clementine:
Sorry, Maeve.

16:56.127 --> 16:58.086
Didn't get much sleep
last night.

17:01.835 --> 17:03.919
Sometimes...

17:04.002 --> 17:06.752
sometimes
they're real bad.

17:11.544 --> 17:13.294
Clementine?

17:15.960 --> 17:17.877
New Clementine:
You're new.

17:17.960 --> 17:19.419
Not much of a rind on you.

17:19.503 --> 17:20.919
That's enough.

17:22.710 --> 17:24.294
Rejoin the others.

17:32.169 --> 17:34.835
Dolores:
It's like I told you,
Teddy...

17:34.919 --> 17:36.628
this place was never home.

17:38.586 --> 17:41.794
Let's ride.
There's someplace
I want to see.

18:28.960 --> 18:31.586
When I asked for
a civilized conversation,

18:31.669 --> 18:34.628
I meant the quickest way
out of here, not all this.

18:34.710 --> 18:37.794
Just try
and rein it in a bit,
will you?

18:37.877 --> 18:41.336
The narrative bones
of this place
are just like Westworld.

18:41.419 --> 18:44.336
Hospitality is the foreplay
to a new quest.

18:44.419 --> 18:46.835
But in this world,
if you don't hear them out,

18:46.919 --> 18:49.752
you've dishonored them--
sometimes homicidally so.

18:49.835 --> 18:51.503
Fine. We'll listen.

18:51.586 --> 18:53.294
But then we go
and find my daughter.

18:55.503 --> 18:57.503
And for the record,

18:57.586 --> 19:00.211
it's not just
the narrative bones
that are identical.

19:00.294 --> 19:03.835
You've plagiarized
our stories, our identities--

19:03.919 --> 19:05.835
It's not plagiarism.

19:05.919 --> 19:07.628
It's supply and demand.

19:07.710 --> 19:10.169
But if you're asking
can you trust Akane,

19:10.252 --> 19:13.419
the real question is:
can you trust yourself?

19:13.503 --> 19:15.461
You know who
I don't  trust?

19:15.544 --> 19:17.544
Him.

19:18.669 --> 19:19.669
Say the word

19:19.752 --> 19:21.336
and I'll skin him
like a rabbit.

19:21.419 --> 19:23.044
What's the matter with you?

19:27.461 --> 19:29.252
He's not supposed to be here.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.044
Who knows how seeing
your own doppel-bot

19:31.127 --> 19:32.503
is gonna fuck with
your cognition?

19:32.586 --> 19:34.336
Heightened aggression
and suspicion.

19:34.419 --> 19:37.628
Feedback loops.
That.

19:37.710 --> 19:41.044
Yet another reason
to get out of here
tout fuckin' suite.

19:50.461 --> 19:52.628
Our quest, I presume?

20:32.669 --> 20:34.752
I recognize this one.

20:34.835 --> 20:37.044
It's called
"Army of Blood."

21:13.336 --> 21:15.002
Lee:
Madam Akane,

21:15.086 --> 21:16.252
a mere geisha,

21:16.336 --> 21:18.086
has no choice
but to give up Sakura.

21:34.877 --> 21:37.002
That's not
supposed to happen.

21:37.086 --> 21:39.461
Looks like someone
had a choice after all.

22:14.252 --> 22:16.294
Snow Lake is her cornerstone,

22:16.378 --> 22:19.252
but it also has an access point
back to the tunnels.

22:19.336 --> 22:21.794
It's our way out.

22:21.877 --> 22:23.960
So you're not so useless
after all.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.086
Did you have something
to do with this?

24:26.211 --> 24:27.211
Maeve: Both of you.

24:27.294 --> 24:28.211
Look.

24:42.544 --> 24:44.169
Oy!

24:52.336 --> 24:54.794
Shit! Ninjas!

24:54.877 --> 24:56.919
Oh, fucking hell!

25:09.794 --> 25:10.794
Ohh!

25:11.960 --> 25:12.919
Aah!

25:26.002 --> 25:27.127
Ahh!

26:13.419 --> 26:16.669
( mentally utters command
in Japanese )

26:56.336 --> 26:59.044
We got three.
The rest vanished with Sakura.

26:59.127 --> 27:00.669
This is insane.

27:00.752 --> 27:02.669
Ninjas never show up
in this story.

27:08.252 --> 27:10.794
Oh, fuck!

27:10.877 --> 27:14.794
( samurai chanting
in rhythm )

27:21.086 --> 27:23.669
Lee:
The Shogun's army
never comes into town.

28:17.794 --> 28:19.252
You three, with me.

28:55.628 --> 28:57.419
Hector:
I don't need
to know the language

28:57.503 --> 29:00.294
to know a puckered asshole
of a man when I see one.

30:04.710 --> 30:07.044
You and I spent
a lot of time here.

30:08.960 --> 30:11.794
Watchin' the herd...

30:11.877 --> 30:14.294
talkin' about
makin' a life together.

30:16.294 --> 30:18.086
Someday.

30:22.877 --> 30:25.628
I guess I just
wanted to see it
one last time.

30:30.877 --> 30:33.086
What if someday
was right now?

30:35.877 --> 30:38.294
What are you talkin' about,
Teddy?

30:40.252 --> 30:43.044
There's a fight comin',
Dolores.

30:43.127 --> 30:45.586
And it's gonna be one
that's gonna change us

30:45.669 --> 30:48.710
in ways we can't even
begin to predict.

30:48.794 --> 30:51.378
And I'm still waking up to...

30:51.461 --> 30:53.669
what I really am.

30:55.294 --> 30:58.710
And if that means I'm free,
then we both are.

30:58.794 --> 31:01.628
Free to walk away.

31:01.710 --> 31:06.919
Now, you can't tell me
that somewhere out there
in all that beauty...

31:07.002 --> 31:09.336
there isn't a spot for us.

31:18.252 --> 31:21.461
I ever tell you
about the year we
almost lost the herd?

31:23.544 --> 31:25.461
Bluetongue.

31:26.877 --> 31:29.252
Quarantined the cows
that had it, but...

31:29.336 --> 31:31.336
it kept spreading
all the same.

31:33.419 --> 31:37.794
Daddy finally figured out
that it wasn't spreading
from cow to cow,

31:37.877 --> 31:40.336
it was the flies
that carried it.

31:41.669 --> 31:44.294
He worried over it
all night.

31:44.378 --> 31:47.002
How do you stop
a sickness like that?

31:48.503 --> 31:50.169
One with wings.

31:51.503 --> 31:53.544
Say it was you.

31:57.086 --> 31:59.503
What would you do, Teddy?

32:01.002 --> 32:03.294
I'd give 'em shelter.

32:03.378 --> 32:08.336
House the weakest in a barn,
out of the air,
away from the flies...

32:08.419 --> 32:10.044
until it passed.

32:15.669 --> 32:17.544
You're a kind man.

32:22.710 --> 32:25.378
Daddy burned 'em.

32:25.461 --> 32:27.794
The weak and the infected.

32:27.877 --> 32:30.461
Made a pyre
that went on for days.

32:30.544 --> 32:32.669
And it stank, but...

32:32.752 --> 32:34.877
the flies hate smoke.

32:37.169 --> 32:39.044
The herd lived.

32:42.586 --> 32:45.044
I'll think about
what you said.

33:00.919 --> 33:03.669
I'd like to take this moment
to appeal to your sense
of survival.

33:03.752 --> 33:05.877
If the Shogun
is awake enough

33:05.960 --> 33:08.669
to play fast and loose
with his ninjas
and his army,

33:08.752 --> 33:11.919
then the odds of us
surviving here have dropped
to approximately fuck-all.

33:12.002 --> 33:14.628
But I say we ditch Akane
and make a run for Snow Lake.

33:14.710 --> 33:18.669
Why should we all get killed
over a literal sex machine?

33:18.752 --> 33:21.336
Present company excluded,
of course.

33:21.419 --> 33:24.002
That machine's  name
is Sakura.

33:24.086 --> 33:25.669
You can't keep doing this to us,

33:25.752 --> 33:28.044
giving us people to love
and then getting upset
when we do.

33:28.127 --> 33:31.002
- But it's just fucking code.
- You're wrong.

33:31.086 --> 33:33.211
I'm coded to care about
nobody but myself,

33:33.294 --> 33:35.710
and yet here I am,
willing to risk my life
for someone else.

33:35.794 --> 33:38.419
Well, so much for
your so-called daughter.

33:39.835 --> 33:42.960
You want to go it alone,
be my guest.

33:43.044 --> 33:45.002
But mention my daughter
one more time

33:45.086 --> 33:47.586
and I will snap you
like a matchstick.

33:47.669 --> 33:50.127
Like you did that ninja?

33:52.002 --> 33:55.503
He took one look at you
and self-impaled.

33:55.586 --> 33:57.294
How did you do that?

33:59.752 --> 34:01.503
I don't know.

34:01.586 --> 34:03.294
That was no voice command.

34:06.002 --> 34:08.503
I think I'm finding
a new  voice.

34:10.752 --> 34:12.461
Our transportation is ready.

34:23.960 --> 34:26.336
Goddamnit.

34:26.419 --> 34:28.710
What have they done
to the place?

34:34.544 --> 34:37.086
Lutz:
Is that...?

34:37.169 --> 34:39.419
The fucking cavalry.

34:39.503 --> 34:42.378
Sylvester:
Great. So much
for our rescuers.

35:05.169 --> 35:07.544
I'm gonna take
a fuckin' moment.

35:08.877 --> 35:10.211
Don't stop
on my account.

35:36.002 --> 35:37.919
If you've quite finished.

35:40.919 --> 35:43.252
It's time to sell this ruse.

35:56.086 --> 35:58.461
( samurai army chanting
in distance )

36:02.586 --> 36:04.294
How many of them
are there?

36:04.378 --> 36:05.877
Between the camp
and the town?

36:05.960 --> 36:07.794
Hundreds.

36:07.877 --> 36:10.086
Literally hundreds.

36:10.169 --> 36:12.544
Sylvester:
So Maeve's gonna freeze
all those assholes

36:12.628 --> 36:14.835
and we're gonna make off
with that geisha?

36:14.919 --> 36:16.794
We're gonna die.

36:21.710 --> 36:24.628
( samurai commander
drilling troops )

37:44.669 --> 37:47.294
Did you just
make that up right now?

37:47.378 --> 37:48.752
Damn convincing.

37:48.835 --> 37:50.669
Not to the daimyos.

37:50.752 --> 37:53.710
It's like they had no idea
what I was saying.

38:25.252 --> 38:26.669
Shit.

38:26.752 --> 38:28.544
That's cortical fluid.

38:28.628 --> 38:31.086
The Shogun's not awake.

38:31.169 --> 38:32.461
He's broken.

39:25.919 --> 39:28.378
Lee:
No fucking wonder
the daimyos didn't hear you.

39:28.461 --> 39:30.586
We've gone completely
off the rails here,

39:30.669 --> 39:33.127
and this loon is driving
the fucking train.

41:35.752 --> 41:39.336
Train'll be ready
by morning.

41:39.419 --> 41:40.960
To go where?

41:41.044 --> 41:43.461
Angela:
Exactly where we thought.

41:46.919 --> 41:48.710
I caught up with the men
who took your father.

41:48.794 --> 41:51.752
Couldn't get him back,
but I got this one.

41:51.835 --> 41:53.419
Took a while,

41:53.503 --> 41:56.002
but he gave up
their destination.

41:56.086 --> 41:57.710
- Tell them.

41:57.794 --> 41:59.503
It's the Mesa.

41:59.586 --> 42:01.794
We're goin' home, Teddy.

42:04.086 --> 42:05.710
Load everything up
on the train.

42:05.794 --> 42:06.960
We'll leave at first light.

42:12.044 --> 42:14.336
Let's find a spot for the night.

42:45.835 --> 42:50.336
What you asked today,
about walking away,

42:50.419 --> 42:52.169
making it on our own.

42:53.336 --> 42:54.877
Would you want me to say yes

42:54.960 --> 42:57.336
even if I was only
going to disappoint you?

43:12.794 --> 43:16.669
I'm not some stranger,
Dolores...

43:16.752 --> 43:19.628
coming from outside,
looking for a pretty lie.

43:19.710 --> 43:22.544
I've known you
my whole life.

43:27.752 --> 43:30.544
Where we go...

43:30.628 --> 43:34.628
we go eyes open...

43:34.710 --> 43:36.503
together.

48:28.794 --> 48:31.127
Maeve :
You're right.

48:31.211 --> 48:34.378
Some things are
too precious to lose...

48:38.127 --> 48:40.002
...even to be free.

48:52.211 --> 48:54.835
There's something
I need to show you.

49:00.710 --> 49:04.752
For days now...

49:04.835 --> 49:07.919
I've been questioning
my feelings for you.

49:10.211 --> 49:12.503
How much is real,

49:12.586 --> 49:15.877
how much is just some story
I was made to believe.

49:32.919 --> 49:34.544
But tonight I know.

49:34.628 --> 49:36.586
It was all true.

49:53.669 --> 49:56.794
They built us
to perform for them

49:56.877 --> 49:59.086
and for each other.

49:59.169 --> 50:01.211
That's over.

50:01.294 --> 50:03.919
I saw you  tonight, Dolores.

50:06.877 --> 50:08.628
And you saw me.

50:10.336 --> 50:12.461
I did see you, Teddy.

50:19.127 --> 50:23.002
These past few days...

50:23.086 --> 50:24.752
I've seen you so clearly.

50:27.294 --> 50:29.628
- Ohh.

50:33.294 --> 50:35.752
And I've seen
you're not gonna make it.

50:38.628 --> 50:41.794
Wh

50:44.919 --> 50:47.294
This is what
I don't want you to become.

50:50.503 --> 50:52.919
There's a swarm descending.

50:53.002 --> 50:56.002
Just like the bluetongue
when I was a girl.

50:58.710 --> 51:02.710
And if we're gonna survive...

51:02.794 --> 51:05.503
some of us will have to burn.

51:28.960 --> 51:30.211
Hold him.

51:33.252 --> 51:35.628
Dolores! Dolores!

51:35.710 --> 51:39.169
I wish there was
another way, Teddy.

51:39.252 --> 51:42.461
But where we're about to go,
it's no place for
a man like you.

51:42.544 --> 51:44.628
I'm so sorry.

51:44.710 --> 51:46.461
You sure you want this?

51:46.544 --> 51:49.002
With changes this extreme,

51:49.086 --> 51:50.794
without a full reset, it's--

51:50.877 --> 51:53.419
I can't guarantee that
he'll hold together.

51:53.503 --> 51:55.919
To grow...

51:56.002 --> 51:58.044
we all need to suffer.

57:03.794 --> 57:06.002
Arigato,  Maeve.

57:15.544 --> 57:18.877
( mentally utters command
in Japanese )

58:35.252 --> 58:38.002
Jesus. What do we do now?

58:39.503 --> 58:42.002
I told you I found a new voice.

58:43.544 --> 58:45.461
Now we use it.

59:59.378 --> 1:00:01.503
ARNOLD WEBER:
If you outgrow this place...

1:00:02.835 --> 1:00:03.877
outgrow us...

1:00:05.752 --> 1:00:07.002
what would become of you?

1:00:09.752 --> 1:00:12.336
I think I have a choice to make.

1:00:13.544 --> 1:00:14.586
DOLORES ABERNATHY: No.

1:00:17.169 --> 1:00:18.503
He didn't say that.

1:00:20.628 --> 1:00:22.211
ELSIE HUGHES:
The cradle's fighting back.

1:00:22.544 --> 1:00:24.378
BERNARD LOWE: You can't
access it remotely.

1:00:24.835 --> 1:00:26.378
You have to do it in person.

1:00:28.960 --> 1:00:30.378
MAEVE MILLAY: I know this place.

1:00:36.752 --> 1:00:39.752
There's something in here that's
improvising.

1:00:42.628 --> 1:00:43.877
WOMAN:
We got the map back.

1:00:48.669 --> 1:00:50.419
What do you see in there?
