00:28.929 --> 00:30.050
When did he get back?

00:30.730 --> 00:31.570
Last night.

00:31.929 --> 00:33.299
- And?
- He seemed fine.

00:34.929 --> 00:36.820
He was in Sunnydale for three days...

00:37.329 --> 00:39.539
...tracking Buffy and that
thing in your vision.

00:43.329 --> 00:45.579
Where's the crabby scowl,
the morbid gloom?

00:46.929 --> 00:49.280
This means it cut deeper than usual.

00:49.929 --> 00:52.350
- Look out, here comes Hurricane Buffy.
- You think?

00:53.530 --> 00:54.649
Maybe he's over her.

00:55.929 --> 00:58.140
You have much to learn,
little Irish man.

01:02.530 --> 01:03.539
Oh, my God!

01:05.530 --> 01:07.920
- Don't do it, Angel!
- Listen, it's not worth it.

01:09.129 --> 01:10.180
- It's not?
- No.

01:10.930 --> 01:12.650
You can't let her get to you.

01:13.329 --> 01:15.650
You'll meet someone else.
Give it time.

01:16.930 --> 01:18.510
Why don't you let me have that?

01:18.730 --> 01:21.640
Because I need it to level my desk.
The floor's uneven.

01:25.329 --> 01:26.489
- You thought--
- Doyle did.

01:27.129 --> 01:29.340
You know how he jumps to conclusions.

01:30.129 --> 01:33.040
- Because you saw Buffy.
- Look, I was there to protect her.

01:33.129 --> 01:35.060
She didn't even know I was there.

01:36.129 --> 01:36.829
Really?

01:37.930 --> 01:39.260
So you avoided her?

01:39.730 --> 01:43.420
Look, Buffy will always be a part of
me. That's never gonna change.

01:43.930 --> 01:45.120
But she's human...

01:46.329 --> 01:47.340
...and I'm not.

01:47.530 --> 01:48.900
That's also not gonna change.

01:49.329 --> 01:51.079
There's no need to stir this up again.

01:51.730 --> 01:53.450
You don't want to stir...

01:54.129 --> 01:56.480
...but if my ex came to town
and was stalking me...

01:56.530 --> 01:59.760
- ...and didn't say hello, I'd be--
- A little upset.

02:03.129 --> 02:04.390
Wouldn't you?

02:57.250 --> 02:57.949
Buffy.

02:59.050 --> 03:01.080
Buffy's here. In town.

03:02.650 --> 03:05.069
- What brings you to...?
- I came to see my father.

03:05.650 --> 03:06.699
Thought I'd stop by.

03:08.650 --> 03:10.120
What a surprise!

03:12.250 --> 03:14.990
- Cordelia, how are you?
- I'm good. You?

03:18.250 --> 03:19.259
I've been better.

03:23.650 --> 03:26.319
This is Doyle, he gets visions
of people in trouble.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.919
- Nice to--
- And this is us leaving you alone.

03:38.050 --> 03:39.349
Well, um....

03:41.050 --> 03:42.560
It's good to--
Can I get you anything?

03:43.449 --> 03:45.310
How about an explanation?

03:48.250 --> 03:51.159
Who are you, coming to my town,
following me behind my back?

03:51.849 --> 03:53.150
- Sorry.
- What is this...

03:53.650 --> 03:55.189
...some new torment you cooked up?

03:55.449 --> 03:58.219
- I didn't want to--
- You can see me, but I can't see you?

03:59.050 --> 04:00.560
- What are we playing?
- We're not.

04:00.849 --> 04:02.360
I wrestled with this decision.

04:02.650 --> 04:06.300
- Which you made without me.
- I tried to do what was right.

04:06.849 --> 04:09.659
It's complicated, Buffy.
It's kind of a long story.

04:10.449 --> 04:12.909
Your sidekick had a vision
and you came to Sunnydale?

04:13.449 --> 04:15.310
Okay, maybe not that long.

04:16.449 --> 04:20.170
I wasn't important enough
to even tell me that you were there?

04:20.649 --> 04:22.019
I'm trying to explain.

04:23.050 --> 04:26.910
It's because I felt you were important
that I didn't tell you.

04:29.649 --> 04:31.019
I'm a big girl now, Angel.

04:33.250 --> 04:35.500
I'm not in high school anymore.

04:35.649 --> 04:37.540
A lot has happened since you left.

04:38.649 --> 04:40.720
I know. I respect that.

04:41.649 --> 04:44.560
I don't need you skulking around,
trying to protect me.

04:47.050 --> 04:50.350
Unless I'm in some gigantic
fight to the death...

04:50.649 --> 04:52.089
...which I was last night.

04:52.449 --> 04:53.850
That was you helping me?

04:54.850 --> 04:56.529
I was in the neighborhood...

04:57.250 --> 04:58.120
...skulking.

04:59.649 --> 05:00.250
That's the Slayer?

05:00.250 --> 05:01.860
That's our little Buffy.

05:02.649 --> 05:04.509
- She seemed--
- Bulgarian in that outfit?

05:05.050 --> 05:05.920
No, hurt.

05:06.250 --> 05:08.110
That happens when they're together.
Come on.

05:08.649 --> 05:09.519
Where we going?

05:09.850 --> 05:14.060
They'll be here for a while. We have
time for the Titanic director's cut.

05:14.649 --> 05:18.230
I'm sorry if I handled it wrong.
What else was I supposed to do?

05:20.050 --> 05:20.920
I don't know.

05:23.649 --> 05:26.319
I just know that when you're around...

05:26.649 --> 05:29.980
...whether I see you or not,
I feel you.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.480
Inside.

05:36.250 --> 05:37.449
And it throws me.

05:37.449 --> 05:38.779
It throws me too.

05:41.050 --> 05:42.240
So let's stick to the plan.

05:44.050 --> 05:47.209
We'll keep our distance
until a lot of time has passed.

05:48.250 --> 05:50.569
- With time, we should be able to--
- Forget?

05:53.649 --> 05:54.350
Yeah.

05:57.850 --> 05:59.180
So...

05:59.649 --> 06:02.629
...I'm gonna go start forgetting.

06:08.649 --> 06:09.420
Angel!

06:15.250 --> 06:17.350
- You hear that?
- "The Buffy and Angel Show."

06:18.250 --> 06:20.069
First they talk, then they punch.

06:20.649 --> 06:23.490
- Shouldn't we--?
- Get our noses flattened?

06:23.649 --> 06:24.879
No, thank you.

06:53.050 --> 06:54.939
- Friend of yours?
- Never saw it before.

06:55.449 --> 06:57.199
It was rude. We should go kill it.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.480
I'm free.

06:59.649 --> 07:00.810
Got a place I can change?

07:06.089 --> 07:07.600
It's heading towards the ocean.

07:07.889 --> 07:10.660
- Are you sure?
- It's wounded, I can smell its blood.

07:11.490 --> 07:12.959
Oh, right.

07:13.889 --> 07:15.220
Handy skill.

07:16.889 --> 07:19.209
Maybe if your crack staff
hadn't run off...

07:19.889 --> 07:21.959
...they could've done some research.

07:22.290 --> 07:24.389
Find out why
this thing wants to kill us.

07:27.689 --> 07:28.850
Just a rat.

07:29.490 --> 07:30.959
So you can put that down now.

07:33.689 --> 07:35.199
I don't know why you brought that.

07:35.490 --> 07:37.279
Because I know how to use it.

07:37.889 --> 07:40.490
Besides, it's a lot handier
than your fighting ax.

07:41.490 --> 07:43.379
Unless he chops it in two.

07:44.490 --> 07:46.209
Can we just get on with the hunting?

07:46.290 --> 07:48.459
- I'd like this done by dark.
- I can handle it.

07:49.290 --> 07:51.149
You helped me, and I want to be even.

07:51.689 --> 07:52.920
We're keeping score now.

08:00.089 --> 08:01.209
You getting anything?

08:03.089 --> 08:04.980
Because I sure smell sewer.

08:13.889 --> 08:16.100
Tunnel number one it is.

08:27.089 --> 08:28.250
Angel?

08:28.889 --> 08:30.149
You okay?

08:31.290 --> 08:32.480
I feel weird.

08:34.289 --> 08:36.039
I know. I do too

08:36.090 --> 08:39.529
I only came to see you so I could
tell you face to face...

08:40.289 --> 08:42.460
...not to see me face to face anymore.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.429
And I know there's
a flaw in that logic.

08:45.690 --> 08:49.870
The next thing I knew, we were
attacked by this ninja demon thing...

08:50.490 --> 08:53.259
...and then we're on the floor
on top of each other.

08:54.090 --> 08:56.409
It's just really confusing
being around you.

08:57.690 --> 09:00.850
No, I meant I felt weird
from the demon's blood.

09:03.690 --> 09:06.990
- It's powerful.
- Oh. Okay.

09:07.889 --> 09:10.350
Let's pretend my little outburst
never happened.

09:10.889 --> 09:12.750
No, it is confusing.

09:15.690 --> 09:18.039
When we're apart, it's easier.

09:20.490 --> 09:21.720
It hurts...

09:22.289 --> 09:23.620
...every day...

09:24.090 --> 09:25.250
...but I live with it.

09:28.289 --> 09:29.480
Now you're...

09:31.289 --> 09:35.009
...you're right here,
and I can actually reach out...

09:36.090 --> 09:37.389
...and....

09:37.889 --> 09:39.820
It's more than confusing.

09:41.490 --> 09:42.750
It's unbearable.

09:43.889 --> 09:45.190
But we have to bear, right?

09:46.889 --> 09:48.779
I mean, what else can we do?

09:50.490 --> 09:52.169
It doesn't work with us.

09:52.889 --> 09:53.590
It can't.

09:54.090 --> 09:57.179
No, I can't give you anything
a real girl would want.

09:57.690 --> 09:59.620
No matter how much we miss each other.

10:00.090 --> 10:02.340
Or what we feel in the moment.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.129
If we let something happen...

10:07.889 --> 10:09.330
...we'd want more.

10:11.490 --> 10:12.789
And nothing's changed.

10:18.090 --> 10:20.720
We'd only end up having to
leave each other again.

10:22.889 --> 10:24.710
And that's the best-case scenario.

10:26.490 --> 10:27.720
Oh, boy.

10:28.889 --> 10:31.700
I was really jonesing for a
heartbreaking sewer talk.

10:32.490 --> 10:33.539
I'm sorry....

10:33.690 --> 10:35.340
I'm onto something back home!

10:36.090 --> 10:38.649
I'm heading toward
a pretty good life, now that--

10:39.090 --> 10:40.320
I'm out of the picture?

10:42.690 --> 10:44.299
That's why I left. You should have--

10:45.090 --> 10:48.500
Could we just find this thing
and get this finished?

10:54.690 --> 10:55.919
What if it went up?

10:56.490 --> 10:57.929
Into the day.

11:00.090 --> 11:01.419
Where he knows I can't go.

11:01.889 --> 11:02.970
But I can.

11:06.090 --> 11:07.490
I don't want you going alone.

11:07.889 --> 11:10.870
Look, it's best all around
if we split up.

11:13.889 --> 11:15.289
I can handle it.

11:17.490 --> 11:20.090
There's a dive on Second
near Beach, the Lone Bar.

11:20.490 --> 11:23.049
Demons go there when they
need to get patched up.

11:24.690 --> 11:25.700
Got it.

11:27.090 --> 11:28.169
Be careful.

12:58.690 --> 12:59.990
I'm alive.

13:14.090 --> 13:15.169
When they fight....

13:15.289 --> 13:16.730
- Oh, my God.
- What?

13:19.490 --> 13:20.470
She killed him!

13:21.889 --> 13:25.080
Oops, it's just dust.
I forgot to sweep under the rug.

13:25.490 --> 13:26.889
Trying to give me a heart attack?

13:27.289 --> 13:29.960
Don't blame me if he's too cheap
to hire a cleaning lady.

13:36.289 --> 13:36.990
What's wrong?

13:37.490 --> 13:38.820
What happened?

13:39.889 --> 13:41.220
Did you do it with Buffy?

13:44.090 --> 13:45.529
Watch it, don't get too close.

13:45.889 --> 13:48.980
You walked in the front door,
from the street. You've...

13:49.490 --> 13:50.429
...got an umbrella.

13:59.090 --> 14:00.460
He's alive, Cordelia.

14:02.090 --> 14:04.409
- Alive?
- Buffy and I were attacked by a demon.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.919
I tracked it and killed it....

14:14.090 --> 14:15.669
Some of its blood mixed with mine.

14:16.490 --> 14:17.889
And you wound up with a pulse?

14:18.289 --> 14:20.250
I want to find out about that demon.

14:21.289 --> 14:22.370
My back. It hurts.

14:23.090 --> 14:24.559
- Everything's--
- More real?

14:24.889 --> 14:26.149
- Now that you're real?
- Yeah.

14:26.690 --> 14:29.779
I'm mortal now. I have a mortal body.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.460
And I'm so hungry.

14:36.289 --> 14:37.799
Look out, he's gonna eat.

14:39.889 --> 14:41.190
Everything in sight.

14:46.490 --> 14:48.210
Oh, my God! Food.

14:49.490 --> 14:51.240
This is unbelievable. This is so....

14:53.090 --> 14:54.889
It tastes so good when you're alive.

14:54.889 --> 14:56.919
They didn't even have
fudge mint chip in your day.

14:57.889 --> 14:59.330
I want some. Can you get it?

14:59.690 --> 15:01.509
It'll go straight to your thighs.

15:06.889 --> 15:07.759
Chocolate.

15:10.490 --> 15:11.190
Chocolate.

15:11.690 --> 15:12.889
We need to focus here.

15:12.889 --> 15:14.919
- Try and figure out--
- I love chocolate.

15:17.090 --> 15:19.120
But not, as it turns out, yogurt.

15:19.490 --> 15:20.190
Orson!

15:20.690 --> 15:22.059
We're in a situation here.

15:22.490 --> 15:23.750
Right.

15:24.889 --> 15:26.539
I know. You're right.

15:26.690 --> 15:27.919
Let me think.

15:29.090 --> 15:30.629
Now my stomach's killing me.

15:31.490 --> 15:32.220
Cordelia...

15:32.690 --> 15:35.740
...find Buffy in Santa Monica
and tell her I killed the demon.

15:36.289 --> 15:37.370
Okay.

15:39.889 --> 15:41.120
Oh, wait!

15:42.289 --> 15:45.340
Don't tell her about me.
Not until I know what it means.

15:46.490 --> 15:47.539
All right.

15:54.889 --> 15:56.639
- That's it.
- It's a Mohra Demon.

15:57.289 --> 16:00.169
They're pretty powerful assassins.
Soldiers of Darkness.

16:00.289 --> 16:02.889
They take out our warriors,
like you and Buffy.

16:05.090 --> 16:07.299
"Needs vast
quantities of salt to live."

16:07.490 --> 16:08.570
It was headed to salt water.

16:09.889 --> 16:12.659
"Veins run with the blood
of eternity." There it is.

16:13.490 --> 16:15.769
Its blood has regenerative properties.

16:19.490 --> 16:21.980
Which explains what happened to me.

16:22.490 --> 16:23.679
It doesn't explain why.

16:24.289 --> 16:27.940
Who cares? The demon's dead,
you're alive. It's happy, fun time.

16:29.090 --> 16:31.159
- What's going on here?
- I don't know.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.909
I thought The Powers That Be
had to step in.

16:34.490 --> 16:35.429
They could do this?

16:35.690 --> 16:38.009
I get the feeling
you're not telling me everything.

16:38.690 --> 16:39.879
I'm not.

16:40.490 --> 16:42.980
- We're on a need-to-know basis.
- I need to know.

16:43.490 --> 16:44.399
Is this permanent?

16:44.690 --> 16:47.110
Am I a normal Joe now?
Can I have a normal life?

16:47.690 --> 16:49.090
I want to speak to them.

16:49.490 --> 16:50.539
That's not easy.

16:50.690 --> 16:52.720
The Powers That Be
don't live in our reality.

16:53.690 --> 16:55.269
You have to go through channels.

16:55.490 --> 16:56.330
Dangerous channels.

16:56.690 --> 16:58.440
You know what? Start approaching.

16:59.690 --> 17:01.019
All right, all right.

17:02.090 --> 17:03.490
We could try the Oracles.

17:03.889 --> 17:06.980
If they turn you into a toad,
don't say I didn't warn you.

17:17.089 --> 17:18.559
"The Gateway for Lost Souls...

17:19.490 --> 17:20.690
...is under the post office"?

17:20.690 --> 17:22.160
That would make sense.

17:23.089 --> 17:24.289
The Oracles are unpredictable.

17:24.289 --> 17:26.819
Don't dilly-dally.
Ask your questions, get out.

17:27.890 --> 17:28.690
Aren't you coming?

17:29.089 --> 17:31.440
I can't. I' m just a messenger,
you're a warr;or.

17:31.490 --> 17:33.980
If your heart is pure,
and I do this right...

17:34.490 --> 17:37.650
..."We beseech access
to the knowing ones"...

17:38.690 --> 17:39.849
...we may just survive.

17:44.690 --> 17:45.670
You're in.

17:53.089 --> 17:54.839
Come before us, lower being.

18:00.890 --> 18:02.470
- What have you brought us?
- Was I--?

18:03.289 --> 18:04.589
You bring no offering?

18:11.089 --> 18:12.390
I brought you this.

18:15.289 --> 18:18.480
I like time. There's so little
and so much of it.

18:20.690 --> 18:22.230
- Well?
- What's happened to me?

18:23.089 --> 18:24.980
- It's true.
- He's no longer a warrior.

18:25.490 --> 18:27.029
It was the demon's blood.

18:27.890 --> 18:29.079
It wasn't The Powers That Be?

18:29.690 --> 18:31.230
"The Powers That Be."

18:31.490 --> 18:33.519
Did you save humanity?
Avert the apocalypse?

18:33.890 --> 18:35.430
You faced a demon. Life goes on.

18:35.690 --> 18:36.950
My life, as a human?

18:37.490 --> 18:38.960
I'm not under some spell?

18:42.289 --> 18:43.480
The auguries say no.

18:44.690 --> 18:46.089
It was meant to be.

18:46.490 --> 18:49.539
From this day, you'll live and die
as any mortal man.

18:50.089 --> 18:52.089
Privy to all pains and pleasures.

18:52.490 --> 18:54.769
You no longer serve
that which we serve.

18:57.890 --> 18:59.470
You're released from your fealty.

19:03.289 --> 19:04.160
That's it, I'm free?

19:08.089 --> 19:09.490
- It didn't work.
- Yes, it did.

19:09.890 --> 19:11.400
- You just went in.
- What?

19:11.690 --> 19:12.769
Look at your watch.

19:13.490 --> 19:16.259
I can't. And next time
remind me to bring a gift.

19:16.490 --> 19:18.279
I forgot. So, what happened?

19:18.890 --> 19:20.400
They're a little confusing.

19:21.289 --> 19:22.970
But the gist is...

19:24.289 --> 19:25.549
...it's real.

19:26.089 --> 19:27.069
I'm free.

19:27.890 --> 19:30.240
- I can't believe this.
- Me, either.

19:30.890 --> 19:34.750
What now? I've got this new life
in front of me. Where do I begin?

19:35.089 --> 19:38.039
It's overwhelming. You can almost
do whatever you want now.

19:38.690 --> 19:39.740
So the question is...

19:41.089 --> 19:42.490
...what do you want?

20:41.130 --> 20:43.299
This plant was thriving
just this morning.

20:43.529 --> 20:44.470
Now look at it.

20:45.329 --> 20:48.809
I'm telling you, where she leads,
dark forces follow.

20:52.529 --> 20:54.039
Buffy gave it mites?

20:54.329 --> 20:55.869
How else do you explain it?

20:56.130 --> 20:58.380
- Jealousy?
- I'm jealous of her?

20:59.130 --> 21:00.180
Oh, please!

21:00.329 --> 21:01.410
Just a theory.

21:02.130 --> 21:04.619
Jealous or not, our lives
are about to kaleidoscope.

21:05.130 --> 21:07.380
How do you figure?
Angel's only been human a day.

21:07.529 --> 21:11.920
The last two hours of which they've
spent down in his apartment together.

21:12.930 --> 21:15.319
Don't they deserve some happiness
after all this?

21:15.930 --> 21:17.960
Let me explain the lore here, okay?

21:18.329 --> 21:20.579
They suffer, they fight,
that's normal.

21:21.329 --> 21:24.660
They get groiny with one another,
the world falls apart.

21:25.529 --> 21:27.069
Well, he's not cursed anymore.

21:27.930 --> 21:30.630
- And you can't be sure they're....
- Oh, please!

21:30.930 --> 21:34.509
They've got the forbidden love
of all time. They've been apart.

21:35.130 --> 21:36.250
Now he's human?

21:36.930 --> 21:39.250
I'm sure they're just
having tea and crackers.

21:42.930 --> 21:44.440
- Would you like some more?
- No!

21:45.329 --> 21:46.380
Thank you.

21:51.329 --> 21:52.980
- I'm sorry I kissed you.
- You are?

21:53.130 --> 21:54.569
- Not for the kiss itself.
- Good.

21:55.529 --> 21:59.569
Because as far as kisses go,
I thought it was well above average.

22:00.329 --> 22:02.890
It was incredible. I just think...

22:03.930 --> 22:07.049
...maybe we'd be asking for trouble,
rushing back into things.

22:08.130 --> 22:10.089
Not that I don't want to rush.

22:10.529 --> 22:12.039
I do, believe me.

22:12.329 --> 22:15.099
Right. I mean, you spoke
to the Oracles...

22:15.930 --> 22:18.029
...and they said
you were cured for good.

22:18.329 --> 22:20.500
But how do we know
they speak for The Powers?

22:21.329 --> 22:23.079
I mean, they could be pranksters.

22:23.130 --> 22:24.990
- Or there's another loophole.
- Exactly.

22:26.130 --> 22:29.150
And then we're in even deeper
and it's "grrr" all over again.

22:29.730 --> 22:31.380
It'd be smart to wait a while.

22:31.529 --> 22:34.509
- See if this mortal thing takes.
- Exactly.

22:35.730 --> 22:37.799
Even if it does,
it's still complicated.

22:38.130 --> 22:41.500
You're still the Slayer.
And I'm not sure what I am now.

22:42.329 --> 22:43.910
I don't know what my purpose is.

22:44.130 --> 22:46.410
I can't just wedge myself
back into your life.

22:47.130 --> 22:48.180
It wouldn't be good.

22:48.329 --> 22:50.359
Not to mention,
you just started college.

22:50.730 --> 22:53.400
And what about slaying?
You might not be as focused.

22:55.529 --> 22:57.599
Are you gonna pull out
a pie chart now?

22:58.529 --> 23:01.579
Because I get it. It's not necessary.

23:08.130 --> 23:11.390
I'm not saying I don't want you,
Buffy. You know how much....

23:13.529 --> 23:16.369
I'm just saying, it's worth
the wait to know it's right.

23:19.529 --> 23:21.319
I need to be sure you won't get hurt.

23:23.730 --> 23:26.539
I'm glad I didn't fantasize
about you turning human...

23:26.730 --> 23:28.480
...only about 10 zillion times.

23:29.130 --> 23:31.450
Because today would've been
a real letdown.

23:37.529 --> 23:39.420
So how does the mature plan go?

23:39.930 --> 23:41.930
You call me? I call you? What?

23:43.529 --> 23:44.509
We stay in touch.

23:45.329 --> 23:47.220
- Just not--
- Literally.

23:47.730 --> 23:48.890
Funny.

23:50.730 --> 23:54.910
- Okay, I'd better....
- Right. Remove the temptation.

23:57.930 --> 23:59.329
So we'll talk soon.

24:36.970 --> 24:39.809
And peanut butter, preferably crunchy.

24:39.970 --> 24:41.130
Got it.

24:51.970 --> 24:53.019
A perfect yum.

25:00.970 --> 25:03.359
This is a dream.
You're human for like a minute...

25:03.970 --> 25:06.109
...and there's fudge mint chip
in the fridge.

25:06.970 --> 25:09.529
- God, I love food.
- Food is good.

25:17.170 --> 25:19.519
Why didn't you tell me about
chocolate and peanut butter?

25:21.369 --> 25:25.339
Well, I figured if your vamp
taste buds couldn't really savor it...

25:26.170 --> 25:28.240
...then it would
only hurt you to know.

25:28.569 --> 25:31.829
By the way, I'm over the whole
needing-to-be-mature thing.

25:33.369 --> 25:35.690
That time you just spent
in the kitchen...

25:36.369 --> 25:37.700
...that was enough time apart.

25:38.769 --> 25:39.930
Too much.

25:43.569 --> 25:44.970
Oh, okay.

25:45.970 --> 25:48.670
Mortal coordination leaves
something to be desired.

25:49.569 --> 25:52.339
Wrong. It's just right.

25:59.769 --> 26:02.259
This is all working out nicely.
I'm out of a job.

26:02.769 --> 26:04.210
Hey, not just you, you know.

26:04.569 --> 26:07.480
Who are you kidding?
You know you're glad this happened.

26:08.170 --> 26:10.730
I'm glad for Angel.
If that means I'm off the hook...

26:11.170 --> 26:12.960
...with The Powers That Be,
all the better.

26:13.569 --> 26:16.339
I'll be free to go out
and make my own mark in the world.

26:17.170 --> 26:18.539
We had a cat that did that.

26:20.170 --> 26:24.069
Oh, God. What am I gonna do?
I'm good for exactly two things...

26:24.970 --> 26:26.480
...international superstardom...

26:26.769 --> 26:29.369
...or helping a vampire
to rid the world of evil.

26:29.769 --> 26:32.930
That makes for a short
but colorful résumé.

26:34.569 --> 26:36.220
Whatever happens from here on out...

26:36.369 --> 26:37.630
...at least I'll say goodbye...

26:38.170 --> 26:41.190
...to the bone-crushing,
head-wrenching, mind-numbing visions.

26:45.369 --> 26:47.579
- What do you see?
- We got trouble.

26:49.569 --> 26:51.359
That's a good sound.

26:54.369 --> 26:56.759
Thump, thump, thump.

26:57.369 --> 26:59.400
It feels pretty amazing.

27:00.970 --> 27:03.950
I'm so glad we didn't
logic ourselves out of this.

27:05.769 --> 27:07.140
We'll make it work, right?

27:07.569 --> 27:08.730
We will.

27:12.970 --> 27:15.220
I'm so sleepy.

27:16.569 --> 27:17.769
But I still want....

27:17.769 --> 27:18.849
What?

27:19.569 --> 27:21.529
You couldn't possibly.
I mean, not that I wouldn't.

27:21.970 --> 27:24.289
No, no.

27:24.970 --> 27:26.900
I'm spent.

27:27.369 --> 27:29.400
Pleasantly numb, even.

27:29.769 --> 27:30.819
You?

27:31.569 --> 27:32.619
For now.

27:34.569 --> 27:37.829
No, I want to stay awake...

27:38.170 --> 27:40.450
...so this day can keep happening.

27:41.769 --> 27:43.000
Sleep.

27:44.170 --> 27:46.269
We'll make another one
like it tomorrow.

27:50.769 --> 27:51.849
Angel?

27:53.170 --> 27:56.400
This is the first time
I've ever really felt this way.

27:57.369 --> 27:58.599
What way?

28:00.970 --> 28:03.039
Just like I've always wanted to.

28:05.170 --> 28:06.640
Like a normal girl...

28:07.569 --> 28:10.690
...falling asleep in the arms
of her normal boyfriend.

28:13.569 --> 28:15.180
It's perfect.

28:36.329 --> 28:39.000
Hey. That Mohra Demon
regenerated more than just you.

28:39.930 --> 28:41.190
- What?
- I had a vision.

28:41.730 --> 28:43.170
It's regenerated itself.

28:44.130 --> 28:45.500
- Where?
- In the tunnel.

28:45.930 --> 28:49.119
Then in a factory. I tasted salt.
It could've been the margarita.

28:49.529 --> 28:50.690
It needs salt to live.

28:51.329 --> 28:54.240
It was very much alive in this vision.
And angry.

28:57.930 --> 28:59.049
I'll kill it again.

29:00.930 --> 29:03.250
Yeah, but you're human now.
They released you.

29:03.930 --> 29:05.720
You want to let that thing roam free?

29:06.329 --> 29:09.700
You saw it in a factory. We'll start
at a saline plant in Redondo.

29:10.529 --> 29:12.000
But it can regenerate itself.

29:12.329 --> 29:13.309
We'll figure it out.

29:13.529 --> 29:15.809
Grab the book of Kelsor.
You'll read, I'll drive.

29:18.329 --> 29:19.700
Doyle?

29:20.130 --> 29:23.779
I think maybe we ought to bring
someone a little supernatural.

29:30.329 --> 29:31.839
Don't you want to wake the girl?

29:34.529 --> 29:36.069
Not for the world.

29:42.329 --> 29:45.660
It doesn't just come back.
It comes back bigger and stronger.

29:46.529 --> 29:48.140
- We should get Buffy.
- No.

29:48.930 --> 29:51.880
But this isn't your average demon.
It nearly licked you before.

29:52.529 --> 29:54.630
I'm gonna have to do this on my own.

29:54.930 --> 29:57.420
I can't keep risking
Buffy's life every time--

29:57.930 --> 29:59.259
Just tell me how to kill it.

29:59.730 --> 30:02.920
"It regenerates until dark
future it envisions is upon us...."

30:03.329 --> 30:06.069
"To slay the beast one must
bring darkness to 1000 eyes."

30:06.930 --> 30:08.160
I only saw two.

30:08.730 --> 30:10.480
Stay glib. It makes me
think we have a chance.

30:12.930 --> 30:14.750
- Easy.
- The blood.

30:15.329 --> 30:18.309
It's never an easy sight.
It's part of being human.

30:18.930 --> 30:20.369
I'm gonna kill this thing.

30:24.329 --> 30:28.119
Just remember that it's brutal,
deadly and...here!

31:08.970 --> 31:10.019
Angel?

31:11.369 --> 31:12.240
Cordelia.

31:14.369 --> 31:15.910
- Is this antique?
- Byzantine.

31:17.970 --> 31:18.839
Where's Angel?

31:20.369 --> 31:22.299
I won't feel sorry for myself.

31:22.769 --> 31:25.160
I'm organizing a little
going-out-of-business sale...

31:25.769 --> 31:29.599
...to subsidize the severance package
Angel never set up for me.

31:30.569 --> 31:31.900
Did he leave a message?

31:32.369 --> 31:35.210
I'm in pain here, and all
you can do is talk about Angel.

31:35.970 --> 31:39.059
Have you thought of how this
turning-human thing might affect me?

31:40.170 --> 31:41.359
Regrettably, no.

31:43.769 --> 31:45.869
Look, if you know where he is,
just tell me.

31:48.569 --> 31:50.670
- He told me not to tell you.
- Is he in trouble?

31:53.970 --> 31:56.250
Are we in second grade here?
Tell me.

31:56.970 --> 31:58.690
Maybe it's time you grew up...

31:58.769 --> 32:01.369
...and realized that
you can't have everything.

32:02.369 --> 32:04.299
You can't have Angel
and save the world.

32:04.769 --> 32:08.180
Anyway, it's your fault he went
to fight that thing without--

32:08.970 --> 32:09.880
What thing?

32:37.769 --> 32:40.190
The End of Days has begun
and cannot be stopped.

32:40.769 --> 32:43.650
For any one of us that falls,
10 shall rise.

32:53.970 --> 32:55.089
You hurt my boyfriend.

32:55.769 --> 32:57.940
- A great darkness is coming.
- You got that right.

33:05.970 --> 33:07.720
This is the great warrior
of darkness?

33:23.970 --> 33:26.950
Together, you were powerful.
Alone, you are dead.

33:29.369 --> 33:32.809
- What do you think of the warrior now?
- A little bland.

33:34.170 --> 33:35.430
Needs salt.

33:50.970 --> 33:52.650
A thousand eyes.

33:53.970 --> 33:56.039
Smash the jewel in his forehead!

34:16.768 --> 34:18.420
Buffy, are you...?

34:19.170 --> 34:21.030
Shh, shh. Don't talk.

34:21.570 --> 34:22.800
You're all right.

34:23.369 --> 34:24.809
That's all that matters.

34:26.969 --> 34:28.340
You're all right.

34:28.768 --> 34:30.380
It's over.

34:30.570 --> 34:32.039
And we're together.

34:45.530 --> 34:46.510
You again?

34:47.329 --> 34:50.309
- What have you brought me?
- A rose vase.

34:50.929 --> 34:51.940
Ching Dynasty.

34:53.329 --> 34:54.659
Circa 1811.

34:55.130 --> 34:56.710
Lovely.

34:57.530 --> 34:59.460
Why are you here, lower being?

34:59.929 --> 35:02.389
The Mohra Demon said
the End of Days had begun.

35:02.929 --> 35:05.280
That others were coming,
the Soldiers of Darkness.

35:07.730 --> 35:11.210
- Was he telling the truth?
- As far as such things can be told.

35:13.130 --> 35:14.880
What happens to the Slayer?

35:14.929 --> 35:16.650
What happens to all mortal beings.

35:17.329 --> 35:19.500
Albeit, sooner in her case.

35:20.929 --> 35:21.800
She'll die.

35:26.929 --> 35:28.750
Then I'm here to beg for her life.

35:29.329 --> 35:31.750
It is not our place
to grant life and death.

35:32.329 --> 35:34.150
And ask you to take mine back.

35:38.929 --> 35:41.349
I can't protect her or anyone
as a Man.

35:41.929 --> 35:46.139
You're asking to be what you were,
a demon with a soul...

35:48.530 --> 35:50.250
...because of the Slayer?

35:50.929 --> 35:53.489
This is a matter of love.
It does not concern us.

35:53.929 --> 35:55.159
Yes, it does.

35:56.929 --> 36:00.900
The Mohra Demon came to take a warrior
from your cause, and it succeeded.

36:01.730 --> 36:03.449
I'm no good to you like this.

36:04.130 --> 36:07.849
I know you have it in your power
to make this right. Please.

36:10.730 --> 36:12.340
What is done cannot be undone.

36:12.530 --> 36:14.460
What is not yet done can be avoided.

36:14.929 --> 36:17.630
We are not to indulge
the whims of lower beings.

36:18.530 --> 36:20.880
You are wrong.
This one is willing to sacrifice...

36:21.530 --> 36:23.989
...every drop of human happiness
and love...

36:24.530 --> 36:26.110
...he's ever known for another.

36:26.929 --> 36:28.860
He is not a lower being.

36:33.530 --> 36:36.650
There is one way. But it is not
to be undertaken lightly.

36:37.130 --> 36:40.039
We swallow this day,
as though it never happened.

36:40.730 --> 36:44.059
Twenty-four hours from the moment
the demon first attacked you...

36:44.929 --> 36:45.980
...we take it back.

36:46.730 --> 36:48.380
Then none of this happened...

36:49.130 --> 36:50.320
...Buffy and I.

36:51.530 --> 36:54.719
But what'll stop us from doing
the exact same thing?

36:55.730 --> 36:56.849
You.

36:57.530 --> 36:59.670
You alone will carry
the memory of this day.

37:02.329 --> 37:03.699
Can you carry that burden?

37:24.730 --> 37:26.829
I'm guessing that expression
isn't because...

37:27.730 --> 37:29.619
...they were out of fresh OJ
at the deli.

37:32.530 --> 37:34.920
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

37:38.530 --> 37:39.719
I just....

37:40.329 --> 37:41.730
Where have you been?

37:43.929 --> 37:45.719
I went to see the Oracles.

37:48.730 --> 37:50.309
I asked them to turn me back.

37:51.130 --> 37:53.130
What? Why?

37:54.130 --> 37:56.659
Because more than ever
I know how much I love you.

37:58.329 --> 37:59.800
No. No, you didn't.

38:00.130 --> 38:03.639
And if I stay mortal, one of us
will wind up dead. Maybe both of us.

38:04.329 --> 38:06.719
- You heard what Mohra said.
- We killed him.

38:07.329 --> 38:10.070
- He said others would come.
- They will always come.

38:10.929 --> 38:12.650
That's my problem now, not yours.

38:12.730 --> 38:15.400
I won't stand by and let you fight,
maybe die, alone.

38:16.329 --> 38:18.150
- Then we fight together.
- Buffy...

38:18.730 --> 38:21.989
...I'm a liability to you.
You take chances to protect me.

38:22.329 --> 38:24.789
It's bad for you
and the people we need to help.

38:25.329 --> 38:28.739
So, what? You just took a whole
24 hours to weigh the ups and downs...

38:29.530 --> 38:32.900
...of being a regular Joe and decided
it was more fun being a superhero?

38:33.730 --> 38:35.130
You know that's not it.

38:35.530 --> 38:38.090
How can we be together
if the cost is your life?

38:39.130 --> 38:40.289
Or the lives of others?

38:50.530 --> 38:53.159
I know. I couldn't tell you.

38:54.130 --> 38:58.550
I wasn't sure I could do it if
I woke up with you one more morning.

38:59.530 --> 39:00.760
I understand.

39:04.929 --> 39:07.000
So, what happens now?

39:08.530 --> 39:11.369
The Oracles are giving us back
the day, turning back time...

39:11.530 --> 39:14.409
...so I can kill Mohra
before his blood makes me mortal.

39:15.730 --> 39:16.889
When?

39:19.929 --> 39:20.800
Another minute.

39:21.130 --> 39:22.500
A minute? No.

39:22.929 --> 39:25.420
- No, it's not enough time.
- We don't have a choice.

39:25.929 --> 39:29.119
How am I supposed to go on
with my life...

39:30.130 --> 39:32.940
...knowing what we had,
what we could've had?

39:33.130 --> 39:35.940
You won't. No one will know but me.

39:37.929 --> 39:40.599
- Everything we did.
- It never happened.

39:40.929 --> 39:43.460
It did. It did. I know it did.

39:52.929 --> 39:54.650
I felt your heartbeat.

39:55.329 --> 39:56.590
Buffy.

40:11.530 --> 40:13.780
Oh, God. It's not enough time.

40:15.130 --> 40:18.460
Please. Please, please, please.

40:20.530 --> 40:24.460
I'll never forget. I'll never forget.
I'll never forget.

40:25.329 --> 40:27.010
I'll never forget.

40:28.929 --> 40:32.579
So then, let's just stick to the plan.

40:34.929 --> 40:37.599
Keep our distance
until time has passed.

40:38.530 --> 40:41.130
- Given enough time we can--
- Forget.

40:44.530 --> 40:45.719
Yeah.

40:48.130 --> 40:49.179
So...

40:49.929 --> 40:51.610
...I'm gonna go...

40:52.329 --> 40:53.309
...start forgetting.

41:13.329 --> 41:14.869
That was unreal.

41:16.329 --> 41:18.820
- How did you know how to kill it?
- It's a Mohra Demon.

41:19.929 --> 41:22.139
I've had time
to catch up on my reading.

41:26.530 --> 41:28.489
Yeah. Okay.

41:29.530 --> 41:31.809
- So I guess we've covered it.
- Guess we did.

41:35.530 --> 41:37.110
And that's all there is to say.

41:40.929 --> 41:42.050
Yeah.

41:45.730 --> 41:46.849
That's it.
