00:09.043 --> 00:10.911
NARRATOR:
Imagine deep in the future,

00:10.944 --> 00:13.347
you and your loved ones
have carved out time

00:13.381 --> 00:15.683
to take in a concert.

00:15.716 --> 00:19.387
But this isn't just
your average jam session.

00:19.420 --> 00:23.724
Let me take you
behind the scenes.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.726
This is what's
actually happening.

00:25.759 --> 00:28.829
You and all your fellow
concert-goers,

00:28.862 --> 00:33.033
your brains are
hardwired together.

00:33.067 --> 00:34.368
Still not getting it?

00:34.402 --> 00:35.603
For the price of admission,

00:35.636 --> 00:37.771
when all of your brains
are connected,

00:37.805 --> 00:42.210
you can be the performer,
the audience, the orchestra,

00:42.243 --> 00:44.945
the vibrations
in the air itself.

00:47.581 --> 00:51.519
You hear a melody,
it sparks an emotion, a memory.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.955
Down the rabbit hole you go.

00:54.988 --> 00:58.726
Imagine literally teleporting
yourself to that moment in time

00:58.759 --> 01:03.464
and actually living
the experience.

01:03.497 --> 01:09.303
Welcome to your future,
in the hive mind.

01:18.412 --> 01:21.215
It's the deep future.

01:21.249 --> 01:23.384
Your body, gone.

01:23.417 --> 01:27.288
You're all computer,
all the time.

01:27.321 --> 01:29.423
Your brain is way more powerful

01:29.457 --> 01:32.993
than even a billion
supercomputers.

01:33.026 --> 01:38.432
Jobs, food, language, water,
even traditional thought,

01:38.466 --> 01:41.001
all of humanity's
building blocks,

01:41.034 --> 01:42.603
all that's done.

01:42.636 --> 01:45.639
And you are immortal.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.508
Squirming in your chair yet?

01:47.541 --> 01:48.976
You should be.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.678
This isn't science fiction.

01:50.711 --> 01:54.248
Today's visionary thinkers say
it's a strong probability

01:54.282 --> 01:57.651
that this is what your world
is going to look like.

01:57.685 --> 02:00.954
Tonight, they'll guide you
toward that spectacular future,

02:00.988 --> 02:03.924
and we'll see how
one family navigates it,

02:03.957 --> 02:06.194
one invention at a time.

02:06.227 --> 02:09.197
This is the story
of your future.

02:09.230 --> 02:13.301
This is the road
to Year Million.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.945
MICHAEL GRAZIANO: Human beings
are the cooperative species.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.480
I mean, that's what made us
so successful.

02:26.514 --> 02:27.715
There's no other
species on Earth

02:27.748 --> 02:29.817
that can come together
in such groups,

02:29.850 --> 02:33.721
instantly intuit what
everyone else is thinking,

02:33.754 --> 02:37.024
and cooperate
on large-scale projects.

02:37.057 --> 02:40.628
NARRATOR: That's right, folks,
communication is our superpower,

02:40.661 --> 02:44.865
whether it's through
the spoken or the written word.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.534
Ever since that
first Homo sapien

02:46.567 --> 02:49.470
turned a primal grunt
into an actual word,

02:49.503 --> 02:51.472
humans have used
word-based language

02:51.505 --> 02:56.977
to make us the alpha species
on this planet.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.846
CHUCK NICE: Communication
is going exactly

02:58.879 --> 03:04.552
where it's been going since the
first primates started talking.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.520
Men will say, 'I don't want
to talk about it,'

03:06.554 --> 03:08.489
and women will say, 'Why not?'

03:08.522 --> 03:10.190
Okay, okay, I had to do it.

03:10.224 --> 03:12.693
I'm sorry. I just had to do it.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.895
NARRATOR: We forgive you, Chuck,
but he does have a point.

03:14.928 --> 03:17.665
While word-based language may be
humanity's superpower,

03:17.698 --> 03:21.535
when communication breaks down,
it is also our kryptonite.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.637
Let's go back to scripture.

03:26.274 --> 03:27.575
CHARLES SOULE:
The Tower of Babel

03:27.608 --> 03:30.778
is one of those proto myths
in human society

03:30.811 --> 03:33.447
suggesting that there was a time

03:33.481 --> 03:36.450
when humans all spoke
the same language.

03:36.484 --> 03:37.785
They decided to get together

03:37.818 --> 03:40.288
and do the most incredible thing
that they could,

03:40.321 --> 03:42.623
which was to build
a tower so high

03:42.656 --> 03:44.858
that it would reach
all the way to heaven.

03:44.892 --> 03:48.396
And so they start building this
thing and it gets really tall.

03:48.429 --> 03:51.299
But then God looks over
the edge of heaven

03:51.332 --> 03:53.634
and says, uh, wait a minute,

03:53.667 --> 03:55.936
this is not what I want
to have happen.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.906
And so he does something clever,
because he is, he is God.

03:58.939 --> 04:01.775
And he, he makes it so that
none of those people

04:01.809 --> 04:03.210
who are building
the tower together

04:03.243 --> 04:04.612
speak the same language anymore.

04:04.645 --> 04:05.779
And so the minute
they stop being able

04:05.813 --> 04:07.214
to speak the same language,

04:07.247 --> 04:08.416
they can't work
together anymore.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.751
And so the Tower of Babel falls

04:10.784 --> 04:12.986
and, and never is able
to be built again.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.922
I think it's such
a brilliant explanation

04:14.955 --> 04:16.457
of the way that
human beings think.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.992
If you could just,
could talk to somebody

04:19.026 --> 04:21.495
and make sure that you were
understood in a clear way,

04:21.529 --> 04:23.130
I think we'd be able
to work together

04:23.163 --> 04:24.632
in a really beautiful way.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.634
I think that'd be incredible.

04:26.667 --> 04:30.304
NARRATOR: You know where
this is headed, right?

04:30.338 --> 04:32.673
PETER DIAMANDIS: We're about
to see this explosion

04:32.706 --> 04:34.408
in the way we communicate,

04:34.442 --> 04:36.810
and that it's these
next 20 or 30 years

04:36.844 --> 04:42.650
that we are really plugging
the brain into the Internet.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.319
NARRATOR: We're headed to
a future of pure, seamless,

04:45.353 --> 04:47.087
unadulterated communication

04:47.120 --> 04:49.990
that will enable levels of
cooperation and intelligence

04:50.023 --> 04:51.692
that will make
the Tower of Babel

04:51.725 --> 04:53.927
look like a Lego set.

04:53.961 --> 04:56.964
And the communication revolution
has already begun.

04:56.997 --> 05:00.167
Billions are spent every year
on communication apps.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.035
Twitter, emojis,
Google Translate

05:02.069 --> 05:04.472
are all breaking down
language barriers.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.507
But these are just
the first baby steps

05:06.540 --> 05:09.343
in the evolution
of communication.

05:09.377 --> 05:11.311
Flash forward
a few thousand years

05:11.345 --> 05:13.280
and traditional
word-based language

05:13.313 --> 05:14.615
will be ancient history.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.550
We'll be communicating
effortlessly

05:16.584 --> 05:18.018
and at the speed of light,

05:18.051 --> 05:20.320
and that will
seismically transform

05:20.354 --> 05:22.990
the very nature
of our existence.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.324
This is how we'll do it.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.660
First stage, telepathy.

05:26.694 --> 05:29.062
Using tiny nanochips
implanted in our brains

05:29.096 --> 05:31.532
connected to
an ultra-high-speed Internet,

05:31.565 --> 05:33.333
we will finally
realize the dream

05:33.367 --> 05:36.236
of actual brain-to-brain
communication.

05:36.269 --> 05:37.871
Opening our brains
to one another

05:37.905 --> 05:41.208
will be a transformational
moment in human communication,

05:41.241 --> 05:44.645
as well as the end of privacy
as we know it.

05:44.678 --> 05:48.682
But when we go there we will be
ready for the next step,

05:48.716 --> 05:51.385
swarm intelligence.

05:51.419 --> 05:53.353
Combining our
high-speed connectivity

05:53.387 --> 05:55.055
with our brain-to-brain
communication,

05:55.088 --> 05:57.357
we'll combine
our diverse outlooks

05:57.391 --> 05:59.226
to exponentially boost
our intelligence

05:59.259 --> 06:03.196
and work together in swarms
to solve problems in groups

06:03.230 --> 06:05.265
that we never could alone.

06:05.298 --> 06:10.203
We'll need it when we come face
to face with alien intelligence.

06:10.237 --> 06:11.539
Figuring out how to communicate

06:11.572 --> 06:13.607
will require
all of our ingenuity

06:13.641 --> 06:15.108
and will only be possible

06:15.142 --> 06:17.878
because of our
communication revolution.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.047
And when we've mastered
swarm intelligence

06:20.080 --> 06:22.716
and become
super-intelligent beings,

06:22.750 --> 06:24.918
the final step in
human communication will be

06:24.952 --> 06:28.889
when we merge our minds
into a single consciousness.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.725
Like that super-trippy concert
we just witnessed.

06:31.759 --> 06:34.628
We'll evolve beyond
individuality

06:34.662 --> 06:37.397
and shed our very sense of self.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.032
And when we've united humanity

06:39.066 --> 06:41.401
into an enormous
super intelligence,

06:41.435 --> 06:42.970
eliminating the barriers
between us,

06:43.003 --> 06:46.106
then we can finally build on
our limitless imagination,

06:46.139 --> 06:47.708
and everything will be possible.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.310
So, what will be our
Tower of Babel look like

06:50.343 --> 06:51.378
in the future?

06:51.411 --> 06:52.980
Stay with us and find out.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.782
But first let's roll
back the clock

06:54.815 --> 06:56.249
to witness the first stage,

06:56.283 --> 07:01.088
when we humans are just
beginning to embrace telepathy.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.100
[muffled chatter, laughter]

07:13.133 --> 07:18.506
This is what your future dinner
party might look and sound like.

07:18.539 --> 07:21.241
[muffled speech]

07:21.274 --> 07:23.276
Oops, I forgot. Since
our brains really do think

07:23.310 --> 07:27.481
faster than we speak, let me
slow it down so you can hear.

07:29.817 --> 07:32.786
Our brains work faster
than our mouths.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.455
EVA: Mm, it's good,
it's really good.

07:35.489 --> 07:36.524
MAN: Jess, your mom's
a lightweight.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.091
NARRATOR: How bizarre will it be

07:38.125 --> 07:42.630
when our mouths are used solely
for eating and breathing?

07:42.663 --> 07:44.965
In the future, a dinner party
will take place

07:44.998 --> 07:46.133
in total silence.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.969
Because words as we know them
will disappear.

07:49.002 --> 07:52.506
Tiny chips in our brains
will enable us to communicate

07:52.540 --> 07:54.942
telepathically via the Internet.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.444
WOMAN: So, Johnny, did you hear
about the tsunami in Morocco?

07:57.477 --> 07:59.647
WOMAN: The family that I saw
today were really interesting.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.649
WOMAN: The project on Europa,
it's amazing.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.283
NARRATOR: Some people,
like Oscar here,

08:03.316 --> 08:05.018
will resist the tech implants,

08:05.052 --> 08:07.855
because it also comes
with a risk for hacking,

08:07.888 --> 08:09.389
but we'll get into that later.

08:09.422 --> 08:12.860
OSCAR: So, how was your day?

08:14.261 --> 08:17.998
MAN: You still haven't
upgraded to telepathy?

08:20.233 --> 08:22.570
NARRATOR: So how do we get to
that telepathic dinner party

08:22.603 --> 08:25.606
in the future
from where we are today?

08:28.208 --> 08:30.210
The key will be to find
a common language

08:30.243 --> 08:32.746
that can connect
all of humanity.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.915
I wonder where we'd find
something like that.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.751
NICE: I will say this,
and I say it without compunction

08:37.785 --> 08:39.419
and with a great deal
of confidence--

08:39.452 --> 08:42.656
the Internet is
our universal language.

08:42.690 --> 08:44.057
It's already there.

08:44.091 --> 08:46.326
And you would think
that we would now have

08:46.359 --> 08:48.762
this incredible
exchange of ideas

08:48.796 --> 08:52.766
and exciting means
of transferring information,

08:52.800 --> 08:54.735
but instead what do we do?

08:54.768 --> 09:01.041
We send emojis that talk to us
in little faces.

09:01.074 --> 09:04.845
Why? 'Cause they're cute
and you can understand them.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.947
NARRATOR: Call them cute
or really irritating,

09:06.980 --> 09:10.117
truth is there's no denying the
emoji's part of a new grammar

09:10.150 --> 09:12.452
connecting people
all around the world

09:12.485 --> 09:14.622
in a way never before seen
in history.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.724
And it's just the beginning.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.792
RAY KURZWEIL: We're going to
connect our neocortex

09:18.826 --> 09:21.028
to a synthetic neocortex
in the cloud.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.596
And I'm thinking that
it will be a hybrid

09:22.630 --> 09:25.132
of our biological brains,

09:25.165 --> 09:28.435
with the non-biological
extension in the cloud.

09:28.468 --> 09:31.104
NARRATOR: When our brains are
directly linked to the cloud,

09:31.138 --> 09:32.906
then the dream
of telepathic communication

09:32.940 --> 09:35.308
will finally be realized.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.711
THOMAS WEBSTER: It's actually
not so far-fetched, I think,

09:37.745 --> 09:39.312
if you think about it.

09:39.346 --> 09:44.084
So if you're able to create
nano-implants or nano-sensors

09:44.117 --> 09:47.120
to put in the brain
of one person,

09:47.154 --> 09:49.456
and then put it in the brain
of another person.

09:49.489 --> 09:51.124
That's a way to communicate
in a way

09:51.158 --> 09:54.127
that we have never
really thought about

09:54.161 --> 09:56.864
in society so far.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.300
ANNALEE NEWITZ:
There are experiments now

10:00.333 --> 10:04.471
where we have
brain-computer interfaces,

10:04.504 --> 10:07.841
which really does suggest that

10:07.875 --> 10:11.611
something like telepathy
could exist.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.847
BARATUNDE THURSTON:
Oh, that's so dangerous.

10:13.881 --> 10:17.617
Oh, man, we're going to have
so many broken relationships.

10:17.651 --> 10:19.787
And look at what people tweet.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.822
That takes effort.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.991
You have to launch an app,
you know,

10:24.024 --> 10:27.327
open up the compose window, tap
out a message, and press send.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.830
And people still say things
they regret,

10:29.863 --> 10:32.632
and lose their jobs over it
and get divorced over it.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.367
Thinking to communication?

10:34.401 --> 10:36.269
That's, that's real sloppy.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.872
That's going to be a hot mess.

10:41.541 --> 10:42.843
NICE: You know, it's funny,

10:42.876 --> 10:44.712
because here's how telepathy
is awesome--

10:44.745 --> 10:47.180
when you're the only person
who has it.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.882
[laughs]

10:48.916 --> 10:50.784
When that's like your superpower

10:50.818 --> 10:53.353
and you're going around
reading everybody's mind,

10:53.386 --> 10:54.988
but nobody can read yours.

10:55.022 --> 10:57.825
That's when telepathy is great.

10:57.858 --> 11:00.560
NARRATOR: That's probably not
going to be how it works.

11:00.593 --> 11:02.462
Telepathy will be
accessible to everyone.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.665
But telepathy will definitely
require some adjustments,

11:05.699 --> 11:07.500
and there will be growing pains.

11:07.534 --> 11:12.472
It won't be all sitting around
the campfire singing Kumbaya.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.374
N.K. JEMISIN: Lord help us, what
if something like a Twitter mob

11:14.407 --> 11:16.043
existed for the mind?

11:16.076 --> 11:20.513
Um, no, I can't think
of anything more horrific.

11:20.547 --> 11:22.049
But if we could control it,

11:22.082 --> 11:24.017
if it was really just
another way of connecting,

11:24.051 --> 11:28.055
like AOL, but you know,
instead of 'You've got mail,'

11:28.088 --> 11:30.891
it's, you know,
'You've got thoughts.'

11:30.924 --> 11:32.359
THURSTON: On the other hand,

11:32.392 --> 11:36.830
it could lead to a more subtle
set of interactions,

11:36.864 --> 11:40.500
because you would feel the
weight not just of your words,

11:40.533 --> 11:42.936
but of your thoughts.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.671
NARRATOR: That will be amazing.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.440
Think of it,
instantaneous, immersive,

11:47.474 --> 11:49.209
empathic communication.

11:49.242 --> 11:52.012
Humanity will never be
the same again.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.713
But it's not going to be easy.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.849
Wireless devices are
manufactured to conform

11:55.883 --> 11:59.286
to an agreed-upon standard,
like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.688
But telepathy
involves human beings,

12:01.721 --> 12:03.757
and we can't agree on anything.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.392
ANDERS SANDBERG:
The fundamental problem

12:05.425 --> 12:09.729
of brain-to-brain communication
is that every brain is unique.

12:09.763 --> 12:12.800
When I think about the concept
of a mountain,

12:12.833 --> 12:15.068
I might envision something
like Matterhorn,

12:15.102 --> 12:17.771
because I was seeing that
as a child.

12:17.805 --> 12:20.473
And my neurons firing
when I think mountain,

12:20.507 --> 12:23.710
might be very different
from your neurons that fire.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.412
So I need to find a mapping,

12:25.445 --> 12:29.416
so when my mountain neurons fire
in a particular pattern,

12:29.449 --> 12:31.051
we can activate the right ones.

12:31.084 --> 12:34.054
That's a very tough
machine learning problem.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.223
NARRATOR: And it's not just
going to be a tough problem

12:36.256 --> 12:37.891
for machines to learn.

12:37.925 --> 12:40.794
It's also going to be a big
adjustment for humans as well.

12:40.828 --> 12:43.063
Not everyone is going to be
an early adopter.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.632
There will be those who don't
want their innermost thoughts

12:45.665 --> 12:46.967
accessible to others.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.236
Or those worried about hacking,
like Oscar,

12:49.269 --> 12:51.171
the patriarch
of our future family

12:51.204 --> 12:55.108
who hasn't yet bought into
this newfangled technology.

12:59.947 --> 13:02.515
JESS: Hey, did Sajani
tell you their news?

13:02.549 --> 13:03.583
EVA: No, what's up?

13:03.616 --> 13:05.285
NARRATOR: Oscar is old school,

13:05.318 --> 13:06.920
but how long can he hold out

13:06.954 --> 13:09.823
when everyone around him is
communicating telepathically?

13:09.857 --> 13:12.359
JESS: Damon wants to marry
another woman.

13:12.392 --> 13:13.861
EVA: What?

13:13.894 --> 13:15.495
Does he want a divorce?

13:15.528 --> 13:16.663
JESS: No, no, not at all.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.265
OSCAR: What?

13:18.298 --> 13:20.367
JESS: Apparently, they met
someone they both like and...

13:20.400 --> 13:21.701
OSCAR: What is it?

13:21.734 --> 13:24.071
EVA: Nothing.
JESS: Nothing.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.310
OSCAR: Okay, that's it.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.778
JESS: Dad.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.346
NARRATOR: At some point
he might have to give in,

13:33.380 --> 13:36.116
just to join the conversation.

13:36.149 --> 13:39.252
OSCAR: Telepathy upgrade,
dosage Oscar.

13:50.898 --> 13:53.934
So, what's for dessert?

14:03.510 --> 14:05.012
NARRATOR:
Telepathy is on its way.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.914
When we connect
our minds together

14:06.947 --> 14:09.582
it will be a singular moment
in human history

14:09.616 --> 14:12.319
sending human intelligence
into overdrive;

14:12.352 --> 14:16.256
a first step on our path
back to that Tower of Babel.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.325
But it won't come
without a sacrifice.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.760
Opening our innermost thoughts
to each other

14:20.793 --> 14:23.063
will begin to blur
the differences between us

14:23.096 --> 14:25.198
and will be
the beginning of the end

14:25.232 --> 14:30.103
to one of our most cherished
possessions: our privacy.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.413
NARRATOR: In the future
we're headed to a world

14:40.447 --> 14:42.115
where Internet-enabled telepathy

14:42.149 --> 14:45.752
will connect us all
brain-to-brain.

14:45.785 --> 14:47.854
This is going to catapult
humanity forward

14:47.887 --> 14:52.459
on our journey to that
future Tower of Babel.

14:52.492 --> 14:55.295
Just imagine the implications.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.767
GEORGE DVORSKY: You know, just
with the flick of a thought,

15:00.800 --> 15:02.802
start to engage in
a conversation with someone

15:02.835 --> 15:04.271
miles away,
and not even have to talk.

15:04.304 --> 15:05.772
That's going to change
a lot of things

15:05.805 --> 15:07.540
in terms of the level
of engagement

15:07.574 --> 15:08.775
that we have with others,

15:08.808 --> 15:09.943
and just even
the sense of intimacy

15:09.977 --> 15:13.313
that we will have with others.

15:13.346 --> 15:18.218
DAVID BYRNE: Ooh, that's
a risky place to go, I think.

15:18.251 --> 15:21.288
Sometimes it might be,
benefit both parties

15:21.321 --> 15:25.258
if you withhold
a little bit of information

15:25.292 --> 15:28.128
and give it some time.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.963
BRIAN BENDIS: Even as we're
sitting here talking,

15:29.997 --> 15:31.965
you're thinking other things
about me, right.

15:31.999 --> 15:34.067
You're lost in
the little bald spot.

15:34.101 --> 15:36.003
Would you want to share that?

15:36.036 --> 15:37.904
NARRATOR: Bald spot?
What bald spot?

15:37.937 --> 15:39.606
I totally didn't even notice.

15:39.639 --> 15:43.410
Okay, yes, it's true, I was
thinking about the bald spot.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.444
He has a point.

15:44.477 --> 15:45.778
There are definitely thoughts

15:45.812 --> 15:48.115
I would prefer not to share
with the world.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.917
But in this newly
highly connected world

15:50.950 --> 15:53.286
where we're communicating
mind-to-mind,

15:53.320 --> 15:55.322
we may not have a choice.

16:01.561 --> 16:04.797
DIAMANDIS: In 2010, we had
1.8 billion people connected.

16:04.831 --> 16:09.636
By 2020, 2025, that number
is expected to grow

16:09.669 --> 16:12.139
to all 8 billion humans
on the planet.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.774
So imagine a time
in the near future

16:14.807 --> 16:16.143
where every single person
on the planet

16:16.176 --> 16:19.046
is connected with Internet.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.014
And these 8 billion people
with a megabit connection

16:21.048 --> 16:25.285
now have access
at a brand-new level.

16:25.318 --> 16:28.121
MICHIO KAKU: The Internet
will evolve into brain-net.

16:28.155 --> 16:32.625
That is, we'll send emotions,
memories, feelings.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.694
And that's going
to change everything.

16:34.727 --> 16:38.131
NARRATOR: So if the signal is
coming from within our brain,

16:38.165 --> 16:41.468
how do we police what
we unconsciously send?

16:41.501 --> 16:43.903
Our deepest thoughts and
feelings could be hacked

16:43.936 --> 16:45.572
and littered
across the Internet.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.741
Who will have access
to these extremely personal

16:48.775 --> 16:51.044
and private parts of ourselves?

16:51.078 --> 16:54.814
How does that change
how we communicate?

16:54.847 --> 16:56.416
MORGAN MARQUIS-BOIRE:
Privacy is at the heart

16:56.449 --> 16:58.651
of many treasured parts
of the human experience,

16:58.685 --> 17:00.087
like love and like family.

17:00.120 --> 17:03.556
It is sort of
a basic right of humans.

17:03.590 --> 17:06.659
The worry, of course, about
the sort of erosion of privacy

17:06.693 --> 17:08.428
is that it changes, you know,

17:08.461 --> 17:10.430
sort of the nature
of who we are as humans,

17:10.463 --> 17:12.999
and the nature of
our relationship with others

17:13.032 --> 17:15.001
in ways that are not positive.

17:15.034 --> 17:18.171
We become afraid to think
certain thoughts,

17:18.205 --> 17:21.274
because we know that
we're constantly being watched.

17:21.308 --> 17:22.842
NARRATOR: You're worried
about the government

17:22.875 --> 17:24.744
monitoring your search history.

17:24.777 --> 17:28.581
Well, in the future it won't
just be your search history,

17:28.615 --> 17:30.683
it will be your entire history.

17:30.717 --> 17:34.521
And that raises
a serious question.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.257
ROSE EVELETH: Are we going to
have privacy in the future?

17:37.290 --> 17:38.591
No.

17:38.625 --> 17:41.361
It's just going to be
a different conversation.

17:41.394 --> 17:45.265
THURSTON: We've been sold
convenience and efficiency

17:45.298 --> 17:50.370
as a tradeoff for letting
essentially surveillance,

17:50.403 --> 17:52.105
at scale, into our lives.

17:52.139 --> 17:55.074
So we get
free information online,

17:55.108 --> 17:57.477
by giving up
our information online.

17:57.510 --> 18:02.715
And if every choice you make
is mediated by an algorithm,

18:02.749 --> 18:06.486
from what you eat, to who you
love, to where you go to lunch,

18:06.519 --> 18:08.388
then that's kind of
a destruction of self

18:08.421 --> 18:10.990
and a destruction of
independence and free will

18:11.023 --> 18:15.495
that gets very philosophical
at that point.

18:15.528 --> 18:18.064
EVELETH: In the sort of most
dystopian version of this,

18:18.097 --> 18:20.667
you're being surveyed
all the time.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.303
TREVOR PAGLEN: When you put
that picture on Facebook,

18:23.336 --> 18:27.340
it becomes a part
of a body of data

18:27.374 --> 18:33.646
attached to that specific person
and to the people around them.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.516
NARRATOR: And that's just
what's going on today.

18:36.549 --> 18:39.186
ADAM HARVEY: You begin to feel
very watched

18:39.219 --> 18:41.654
when you know how powerful
computer vision is,

18:41.688 --> 18:45.124
in terms of extracting knowledge
and building a narrative.

18:45.158 --> 18:48.261
NARRATOR: In the future, when
we communicate telepathically,

18:48.295 --> 18:50.997
technology might stop
tracking key words or faces,

18:51.030 --> 18:54.467
and start tracking your thoughts
and your feelings.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.636
THURSTON:
That's pretty terrifying.

18:56.669 --> 18:57.870
PAGLEN: It's a question
of freedom,

18:57.904 --> 19:00.340
and it's a question of rights.

19:00.373 --> 19:02.709
NARRATOR: We risk becoming
a kind of surveillance state

19:02.742 --> 19:03.776
in the future.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.545
Some say we already are.

19:05.578 --> 19:08.681
And as we spend more and more
of our time online,

19:08.715 --> 19:10.483
watching and learning
on the Internet,

19:10.517 --> 19:13.353
the Internet is also
watching and learning us.

19:13.386 --> 19:14.821
It's a two-way street.

19:14.854 --> 19:18.525
And that could be
a frightening proposition.

19:18.558 --> 19:24.997
*

19:25.031 --> 19:27.033
PAGLEN: For a number of years
in studio,

19:27.066 --> 19:32.038
we've been developing tools
to work with machine vision.

19:32.071 --> 19:34.874
NARRATOR: Trevor Paglen is
an artist in San Francisco.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.843
And he created
this performance piece

19:36.876 --> 19:39.246
with the famed Kronos Quartet.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.848
It looks like a normal concert,
right?

19:41.881 --> 19:43.850
Except it's anything but.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.818
These musicians
are being watched,

19:45.852 --> 19:47.420
and not just by the audience.

19:47.454 --> 19:50.089
Cameras project the performers
on the screen,

19:50.122 --> 19:55.362
and using algorithms,
interpret what they're seeing.

19:55.395 --> 19:58.097
PAGLEN: You start to see
a very sharp contrast

19:58.130 --> 19:59.932
between how you,
as a human audience,

19:59.966 --> 20:01.401
are perceiving the performance,

20:01.434 --> 20:03.736
and how these machinic
forms of seeing

20:03.770 --> 20:05.405
are perceiving the performance.

20:05.438 --> 20:08.541
NARRATOR: As you can tell, it's
not always completely accurate.

20:08.575 --> 20:11.210
But using facial recognition
software,

20:11.244 --> 20:13.079
Trevor is using this performance

20:13.112 --> 20:16.249
to demonstrate how computers
watch and record us.

20:16.283 --> 20:18.718
And just how easy would it be
for computers

20:18.751 --> 20:22.422
to build a digital profile of us
based on algorithms

20:22.455 --> 20:26.593
that may or may not have
our best interests in mind.

20:26.626 --> 20:32.231
PAGLEN: My concern is that this
very intimate quantification

20:32.265 --> 20:33.400
of everyday life

20:33.433 --> 20:38.070
adds up to an extremely
conformist society.

20:38.104 --> 20:39.739
It's very easy
to imagine a future

20:39.772 --> 20:43.543
in which you put a picture of
you drinking a beer on Facebook,

20:43.576 --> 20:45.144
that automatically translating

20:45.177 --> 20:48.415
into an increase
in your car insurance.

20:48.448 --> 20:52.319
NARRATOR: That's bad,
but it could get much worse.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.557
KAKU: Let's say a crime
is committed,

20:57.590 --> 21:02.228
and the CIA or the FBI wants
to have access to everyone

21:02.261 --> 21:04.964
who has an inclination
to do something

21:04.997 --> 21:07.900
like the crime
that was just committed.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.069
It scans a database
of everybody,

21:10.102 --> 21:11.638
and then just prints out
the names.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.072
And you could be
totally innocent

21:13.105 --> 21:15.742
and your name could be
picked out.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.611
NARRATOR: You might be thinking
of Edward Snowden right now.

21:18.645 --> 21:22.349
You can see how, unchecked,
this kind of access and power

21:22.382 --> 21:24.784
is wide open for abuse.

21:24.817 --> 21:27.119
NEWITZ: How do we make sure
that this kind of technology

21:27.153 --> 21:31.290
isn't being used to categorize
people unfairly?

21:31.324 --> 21:34.126
It leads right into issues
around racial profiling,

21:34.160 --> 21:35.462
it leads into issues

21:35.495 --> 21:38.197
around other kinds
of profiling as well.

21:38.230 --> 21:40.099
NARRATOR: And what about
identity theft?

21:40.132 --> 21:41.634
Sure, it's a problem today,

21:41.668 --> 21:44.103
but when the Internet
is a part of your brain,

21:44.136 --> 21:46.473
hackers might just not be able
to steal your data,

21:46.506 --> 21:49.542
they might also be able
to hack your mind!

21:49.576 --> 21:51.444
MARQUIS-BOIRE: As anyone
who's sat in a plane

21:51.478 --> 21:53.813
and worried about the hundreds
of thousands of lines of code

21:53.846 --> 21:57.350
that keep them
floating in the air,

21:57.384 --> 21:58.951
you know, similarly,

21:58.985 --> 22:01.788
the exploitability
of our digital lives

22:01.821 --> 22:05.024
is something that, you know,

22:05.057 --> 22:06.893
it's sort of like
an ever-pressing concern

22:06.926 --> 22:08.728
in the back of my mind.

22:08.761 --> 22:11.898
NARRATOR: These are serious
issues with major repercussions

22:11.931 --> 22:13.966
that our newly connected society

22:14.000 --> 22:15.568
is going to have
to grapple with,

22:15.602 --> 22:17.704
because the Internet
isn't going anywhere.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.406
BRYAN JOHNSON: In the history
of the human race,

22:19.439 --> 22:23.075
we have never stopped
the development of a technology.

22:23.109 --> 22:24.977
No matter how dangerous it is,

22:25.011 --> 22:27.146
we have never been able
to stop it.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.381
NARRATOR: The trend
of human history

22:28.415 --> 22:30.717
is greater and greater
connection.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.251
There's no turning back.

22:32.284 --> 22:35.221
We have opened
the Pandora's box.

22:35.254 --> 22:36.489
DIAMANDIS: I see us going,

22:36.523 --> 22:40.593
over the next 30, 40 years
at the outmost,

22:40.627 --> 22:43.162
from individuals, me and you,

22:43.195 --> 22:47.767
to a meta-intelligence, where
8 billion people are plugged in,

22:47.800 --> 22:51.704
through the cloud, knowing each
other's thoughts and feelings,

22:51.738 --> 22:55.608
and becoming conscious
at a brand-new level.

22:55.642 --> 22:59.178
NARRATOR: Our current notion of
privacy will be ancient history.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.247
But that is a sacrifice
we'll have to make,

23:01.280 --> 23:05.585
because we will gain so much
more in our new open society.

23:05.618 --> 23:07.454
SANDBERG:
One could imagine a world

23:07.487 --> 23:11.524
where thoughts are flowing
freely between different minds,

23:11.558 --> 23:13.760
but different minds
are solving problems

23:13.793 --> 23:17.229
or looking at things
from a different perspective.

23:17.263 --> 23:19.632
NARRATOR: When we master
telepathy and redefine privacy,

23:19.666 --> 23:22.735
we'll be on our way to that
shining tower of the future.

23:22.769 --> 23:23.936
What comes next?

23:23.970 --> 23:26.105
A revolutionary form
of communication

23:26.138 --> 23:27.940
that will unlock
the collective power

23:27.974 --> 23:29.576
of our supercharged brains.

23:29.609 --> 23:31.978
Nothing can stop us when
we launch human cooperation

23:32.011 --> 23:35.848
into overdrive
with swarm intelligence.

23:43.355 --> 23:46.493
NARRATOR: They say two heads
are better than one.

23:46.526 --> 23:50.162
Well, in the future we're not
going to settle for just two,

23:50.196 --> 23:55.802
try 200, 2,000, 2 million!

23:55.835 --> 24:00.006
Powered by high-speed Internet
connected directly to our brain,

24:00.039 --> 24:02.509
we'll all be communicating
telepathically

24:02.542 --> 24:07.279
and working together
at the speed of light.

24:07.313 --> 24:09.281
And that's going to
blow the walls

24:09.315 --> 24:12.418
off what humanity is capable of.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.320
And whom does
the hyper-connected,

24:14.353 --> 24:16.589
telepathic society
of Year Million

24:16.623 --> 24:19.125
have to thank
for their superpower?

24:19.158 --> 24:21.861
That's right, bees.

24:21.894 --> 24:25.264
Welcome to swarm intelligence.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.867
['Flight of the Bumblebee'

24:27.900 --> 24:29.268
LOUIS ROSENBERG: Bees go out,

24:29.301 --> 24:31.504
and every year
they have to find a new home.

24:31.538 --> 24:34.674
And so what they do is
they form a swarm.

24:34.707 --> 24:36.709
And that swarm will negotiate

24:36.743 --> 24:41.213
and find the best possible site
among all the options.

24:41.247 --> 24:43.550
And what's amazing is that
an individual bee can't conceive

24:43.583 --> 24:46.653
of the problem of finding
the best possible site.

24:46.686 --> 24:49.221
But when they work together
as a swarm,

24:49.255 --> 24:52.559
they converge
on that best answer.

24:54.727 --> 24:57.396
EVELETH: You might know a ton
about Chinese geography,

24:57.429 --> 24:58.965
which I don't know
anything about.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.233
And I might know a ton
about krill,

25:01.267 --> 25:03.035
and you might not know
anything about that.

25:03.069 --> 25:04.503
I actually do know
a lot about krill.

25:04.537 --> 25:06.205
And then together,
we're really good at Jeopardy,

25:06.238 --> 25:07.540
or whatever it is, you know.

25:07.574 --> 25:10.042
And that's kind of the idea,
right?

25:10.076 --> 25:13.379
THURSTON: Connectivity
breeds connection.

25:13.412 --> 25:15.214
I think that there's
something real powerful,

25:15.247 --> 25:17.349
if thought becomes
communication.

25:17.383 --> 25:19.151
ROSENBERG: 'Cause ultimately,

25:19.185 --> 25:24.090
it's about collecting input
from diverse groups.

25:26.726 --> 25:29.328
NARRATOR: For animals,
the key to swarm intelligence

25:29.361 --> 25:32.398
is rapid communication
within the group.

25:32.431 --> 25:34.200
One of the things
that's held back humans

25:34.233 --> 25:37.336
from tapping the full potential
of swarm intelligence

25:37.369 --> 25:40.039
is our traditional
word-based language.

25:40.072 --> 25:43.576
Powerful as it is,
it's just too slow.

25:43.610 --> 25:45.344
JOHNSON: Right now,
we communicate

25:45.377 --> 25:49.616
at something like 40 to 60
bits per second via voice.

25:49.649 --> 25:53.452
But our brains can process
information much faster.

25:55.554 --> 25:58.090

25:58.124 --> 25:59.892
we should find solutions
to problems

25:59.926 --> 26:02.895
that over time, as technology
becomes more seamless,

26:02.929 --> 26:05.364
they'll just think, and they'll
think together as a system,

26:05.397 --> 26:06.733
they'll think together
as a swarm,

26:06.766 --> 26:08.234

26:08.267 --> 26:13.272
that optimizes the satisfaction
of the whole population.

26:13.305 --> 26:15.041
SANDBERG: Once we figure out
the science

26:15.074 --> 26:17.610
of deliberately swarming people,

26:17.644 --> 26:19.078
we're going to unleash

26:19.111 --> 26:23.582
a tremendous form
of collective intelligence.

26:23.616 --> 26:26.085
NARRATOR: Swarm intelligence
could well be the only way

26:26.118 --> 26:27.419
in the far future

26:27.453 --> 26:31.758
that we can compete with
artificial intelligence.

26:31.791 --> 26:34.593
When we combine our collective
brain power together,

26:34.627 --> 26:37.596
it will be like millions
of incredibly powerful computers

26:37.630 --> 26:42.601
uniting to solve the world's
most pressing problems.

26:42.635 --> 26:46.739
Like how to house refugees whose
homes have been destroyed by war

an increasingly warming planet.

26:57.516 --> 26:59.285
[muffled voices]

26:59.318 --> 27:02.154
This is what swarm intelligence

27:08.795 --> 27:10.362
But where are my manners?

27:10.396 --> 27:13.766
Let me slow this down again

27:13.800 --> 27:17.103
Really, this conversation
happened in the blink of an eye.

27:17.136 --> 27:19.171

in less than a month.

27:19.205 --> 27:22.374
WOMAN: Not to mention
the hurricanes in North America.

27:22.408 --> 27:24.543
WOMAN: And the drought
in Central Asia.

27:24.576 --> 27:27.479
MAN: Climate change is
wreaking havoc in our cities.

27:27.513 --> 27:30.149
WOMAN: Millions of people
have been displaced.

JESS: We have to do something
to help them.

27:32.518 --> 27:34.620
MAN: Can we stabilize
the climate?

27:34.653 --> 27:38.224
WOMAN: Eventually, yes,
but in the meantime?

27:38.257 --> 27:40.827
JESS: These people need homes.
What can we do?

27:40.860 --> 27:42.862

they're able to come up with
a creative and fast solution

27:54.106 --> 27:55.341
to save the planet.

27:55.374 --> 27:56.642
MAN: We need mobility.

27:56.675 --> 27:57.676
JESS: Mobile.

27:57.710 --> 27:59.045
MAN: Inexpensive.

27:59.078 --> 28:00.980

28:12.725 --> 28:14.193
JEMISIN: We've got the potential
to harness

28:14.226 --> 28:16.595
a tremendously
democratizing force.

28:16.628 --> 28:18.597
A planet-wide e-democracy.

28:18.630 --> 28:20.166
Which would be awesome,

28:20.199 --> 28:22.534
if we can manage to do it
in a way that's safe.

28:22.568 --> 28:25.404
NARRATOR: Swarms of doctors
could find cures for diseases

28:25.437 --> 28:27.039
faster than they could alone.

28:27.073 --> 28:30.409
Swarms of engineers could invent
machines and build structures

28:30.442 --> 28:32.444

28:32.478 --> 28:34.847
The bigger and more connected
the swarm,

28:34.881 --> 28:38.084
the more powerful it could be.

28:38.117 --> 28:39.418
But like anything powerful,

28:39.451 --> 28:43.622
there is a dark side
to the swarm.

28:43.655 --> 28:45.457
NEWITZ: As we all know,
big groups of people

28:45.491 --> 28:49.929
sometimes get together and,
you know, do really dumb things.

28:49.962 --> 28:51.597
NARRATOR: The Internet
is already full

28:51.630 --> 28:52.799
of hackers and trolls.

28:52.832 --> 28:56.435
Now imagine a global swarm
of snooping hackers,

28:56.468 --> 28:59.071
connected directly
to your brain.

28:59.105 --> 29:00.773
AMY WEBB: As with everything,

29:00.807 --> 29:06.545
there is the technology and then
the way that we use technology.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.881
MARQUIS-BOIRE: Technology acts
as a power amplifier, right?

29:08.915 --> 29:12.651
And so it is neither sort of
inherently good nor bad.

29:12.684 --> 29:15.321
It's simply a tool that
amplifies the desires

29:15.354 --> 29:18.324
of the individual
or the institution.

29:18.357 --> 29:22.061
WEBB: Part of our obligations
as humans

29:22.094 --> 29:26.598
is to inject ourselves
in the process.

29:26.632 --> 29:28.300
THURSTON: We have to learn
from the mistakes we've made

29:28.334 --> 29:32.471
with past technologies
and with past human interaction.

29:32.504 --> 29:34.941
NARRATOR: Swarm intelligence
is powerful,

29:34.974 --> 29:36.408
and we'll have to make sure that

29:36.442 --> 29:38.811
we use our massive
new intelligence

29:38.845 --> 29:42.481
to unite humanity,
not to oppress others.

29:42.514 --> 29:45.517
But the true test of our
elevated ability to cooperate

29:45.551 --> 29:49.655
will come when we encounter
something other than ourselves.

29:49.688 --> 29:53.492
That's right. Aliens.

29:53.525 --> 29:56.195
KAKU: Let's say one day
we're scanning the heavens,

29:56.228 --> 29:58.697
and we pick up
a regular message.

29:58.730 --> 30:01.633
Not random noise,
but a regular message.

KAKU: That, of course,
is going to be earthshaking.

30:08.740 --> 30:10.542
NARRATOR: It certainly will be.

30:10.576 --> 30:13.279
How will we communicate
with them?

30:13.312 --> 30:15.814
Understanding what
extraterrestrials are doing

30:15.848 --> 30:19.118
in the skies above us
will be a major test

30:19.151 --> 30:22.221
of our newfound
communication skills.

30:22.254 --> 30:29.028
It may be the difference between
survival and extinction.

30:29.061 --> 30:36.068

30:50.749 --> 30:52.218
NARRATOR: As we trip
the light fantastic

30:52.251 --> 30:53.920
down the path to Year Million,

30:53.953 --> 30:55.187
toward a time when we can build

30:55.221 --> 30:57.323
our very own tower
to the heavens,

30:57.356 --> 31:00.759
communication will be
completely redefined.

31:00.792 --> 31:03.329
But let's be clear when
we talk about the Year Million.

31:03.362 --> 31:06.098
We're not really talking
about a specific year.

31:06.132 --> 31:10.069
It's our way of saying a future
so different, so transformative,

31:10.102 --> 31:13.172
that it's just a glimmer on
the horizon of our imagination.

31:13.205 --> 31:16.108
And only the boldest thinkers
are able to see

31:16.142 --> 31:17.543
where we're headed.

31:17.576 --> 31:20.046
We just might make
some astounding discoveries

31:20.079 --> 31:23.049
along the way.

31:23.082 --> 31:24.416
KAKU: I'm going
to stick my neck out

31:24.450 --> 31:27.586
and say that we will
probably make contact

31:27.619 --> 31:30.056
with an extraterrestrial
civilization.

31:30.089 --> 31:33.926
That's going to be one
of the greatest turning points

31:33.960 --> 31:35.794
in human history.

31:35.827 --> 31:41.533
Every single historical account
of the evolution of our species

31:41.567 --> 31:43.369
will have to take into account

31:43.402 --> 31:45.637
the fact that we have
finally made contact

31:45.671 --> 31:48.607
with another
intelligent life-form.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.809
NARRATOR: And when that day
finally arrives,

31:50.842 --> 31:53.545
the question is, what then?

31:53.579 --> 31:55.047
EVELETH:
You want to make sure that,

31:55.081 --> 31:56.415
like, they don't want
to kill you.

31:56.448 --> 31:58.117
Very quickly,
as quickly as you can,

31:58.150 --> 31:59.585
you want to make sure

31:59.618 --> 32:01.453
that they are not trying
to kill and eat you, right.

32:01.487 --> 32:03.789
NARRATOR: Yes, that would be
tops on the list,

32:03.822 --> 32:05.224
I would imagine.

32:05.257 --> 32:07.459
Assuming we get past that,
what next?

32:07.493 --> 32:10.796
It could be the greatest moment
in human history, or not.

32:10.829 --> 32:12.398
After all, first contact

32:12.431 --> 32:15.567
could be 'Arrival'
or 'Independence Day.'

32:15.601 --> 32:17.169
THURSTON: I loved 'Arrival.'

32:17.203 --> 32:19.738
It's about feelings
and communication.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.507
EVELETH: 'Arrival'
is a great example

32:21.540 --> 32:23.775
of that being patient and
trying to actually communicate,

32:23.809 --> 32:26.245
and trying to think
about things scientifically

32:26.278 --> 32:28.414
and not rush into anything.

32:28.447 --> 32:31.083
When we are looking at
these species or whatever,

32:31.117 --> 32:32.584
aliens that come,

32:32.618 --> 32:35.687
is a better method than just
trying to blow them up.

32:35.721 --> 32:39.258
NEGIN FARSAD: I like the idea
of aliens being like prettier

32:39.291 --> 32:41.293
than what we've thought of them.

32:41.327 --> 32:43.862
You know, we've kind of
made them ugly

32:43.895 --> 32:45.531
over the last several decades.

32:45.564 --> 32:47.099
There's no need for that.

32:47.133 --> 32:50.469
They can actually be quite
gorgeous, you know what I mean?

32:50.502 --> 32:52.104
NARRATOR: That's a good point,
Negin,

32:52.138 --> 32:53.439
but whatever they look like,

32:53.472 --> 32:55.207
let's just assume
for the sake of argument

32:55.241 --> 32:57.376
that first contact
with extraterrestrials

32:57.409 --> 32:59.545
goes more in the direction
of 'Arrival.'

32:59.578 --> 33:00.846
Then our greatest challenge,

33:00.879 --> 33:02.548
what all of our
super-charged intelligence

33:02.581 --> 33:05.884
will need to figure out,
is how to communicate with them.

33:05.917 --> 33:07.386
But it's not going to be easy.

33:07.419 --> 33:11.690
Without an Alien Dictionary,
where do we even begin?

33:13.059 --> 33:14.493
KAKU: There are three features

33:14.526 --> 33:16.728
that we think intelligent
alien life will have.

33:16.762 --> 33:19.398
First of all is vision,
some kind of stereovision,

33:19.431 --> 33:21.233
the vision of a hunter.

33:21.267 --> 33:24.070
Second is a thumb,
a grappling instrument,

33:24.103 --> 33:25.737
a tentacle of some sort.

33:25.771 --> 33:29.308
And third, a language by which
you can hand down information

33:29.341 --> 33:31.377
from generation to generation.

33:31.410 --> 33:33.245
But they're not going
to communicate

33:33.279 --> 33:34.880
using American English,

33:34.913 --> 33:37.349
and they're not going to have
subject, verb, predicate,

33:37.383 --> 33:39.885
the way we construct sentences.

33:39.918 --> 33:43.889
NICE: I hope, I can only hope

33:43.922 --> 33:49.228
that they all look something
like Selma Hayek.

33:49.261 --> 33:50.896
That would be really good.

33:50.929 --> 33:53.031
NARRATOR: We're talking about
communication here, Chuck,

33:53.065 --> 33:54.400
let's stick to the subject.

33:54.433 --> 33:55.767
EVELETH: What are
the linguistics of this?

33:55.801 --> 33:57.369
What does this
actually look like?

33:57.403 --> 33:58.870
How do we figure out,

33:58.904 --> 34:00.772
when they're painting
these weird circles,

34:00.806 --> 34:03.109
and we're using these
weird lines and sticks,

34:03.142 --> 34:05.577
how do we figure out
how to communicate with them?

34:05.611 --> 34:07.446
NARRATOR: How we figure out
the aliens' language

34:07.479 --> 34:09.348
will make or break us,

34:09.381 --> 34:11.783
and scientists are
already working on it.

34:11.817 --> 34:13.085
How, you might ask?

34:13.119 --> 34:15.921
Well, by taking a page
from Dr. Doolittle's book

34:15.954 --> 34:19.925
and starting right here
with the animals on Earth.

34:19.958 --> 34:22.361
Dolphins to be specific.

34:22.394 --> 34:24.296
At the National Aquarium
in Maryland,

34:24.330 --> 34:27.599
Dr. Diana Reiss and her team
are studying dolphins

34:27.633 --> 34:31.103
and how one day we might be able
to not just understand them,

34:31.137 --> 34:33.605
but communicate with them.

34:33.639 --> 34:34.806
DIANA REISS:
I got really interested

34:34.840 --> 34:36.775
in working with dolphins
particularly,

34:36.808 --> 34:39.111
because they were
so different from us.

34:39.145 --> 34:41.947
These animals are truly
non-terrestrials

34:41.980 --> 34:44.283
in every sense of the word.

34:44.316 --> 34:45.951
ANA HOCEVAR: We're trying
to understand

34:45.984 --> 34:49.488
how we could communicate to
a completely different species

34:49.521 --> 34:53.925
that is as close to an alien
as you can get, for a human.

34:53.959 --> 34:55.494
NARRATOR: 95 million years ago

34:55.527 --> 34:59.298
dolphins and primates parted
ways on the evolutionary chain.

34:59.331 --> 35:01.400
But like us,
dolphins have big brains

35:01.433 --> 35:03.935
and a sophisticated
social intelligence.

35:03.969 --> 35:06.838
So, as far as working with any
other animals on the planet,

35:06.872 --> 35:09.341
there is none better suited
to being a test case

35:09.375 --> 35:11.910
for learning to speak to aliens
than dolphins.

35:11.943 --> 35:16.248
REISS: What we did was we
created an underwater keyboard.

35:16.282 --> 35:18.150
It's like a big iPhone.

35:18.184 --> 35:20.486
And if you touch it,
something happens.

35:20.519 --> 35:23.489
I want to give us
this interface,

35:23.522 --> 35:26.458
a window where
we can exchange things.

35:26.492 --> 35:27.759
HOCEVAR: It really
opens the door

35:27.793 --> 35:29.861
to understanding
their vocalizations.

35:29.895 --> 35:32.664
NARRATOR: Of course!
An interspecies iPhone.

35:32.698 --> 35:34.333
Dr. Reiss and her team
are hopeful

35:34.366 --> 35:36.302
that this technology
will be a platform

35:36.335 --> 35:37.669
in which humans and dolphins

35:37.703 --> 35:40.872
can one day learn
to understand one another.

35:40.906 --> 35:43.108
REISS: Wouldn't it be amazing
when they hit a key,

35:43.141 --> 35:44.643
it translates to English?

35:44.676 --> 35:48.347
You can hear that
and you can respond.

35:48.380 --> 35:49.548
NARRATOR: Amazingly,
their efforts

35:49.581 --> 35:51.383
are already being rewarded.

35:51.417 --> 35:52.851
The dolphin have
already figured out

35:52.884 --> 35:54.886
that if they touch the screen
with their beaks,

35:54.920 --> 35:57.189
they get a reaction.

35:57.223 --> 35:59.991
MATT MIRA: What are dolphins
going to be talking about?

36:00.025 --> 36:03.962
Yeah, water's kind of
warm today, huh? Yep.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.164
SOULE: I hope that that's
basically what they're saying.

36:06.198 --> 36:09.668
These fish are great.
I love to swim. Let's jump.

36:09.701 --> 36:11.737
NARRATOR: Or maybe they're
discussing dolphin politics

36:11.770 --> 36:13.004
and dolphin philosophy.

36:13.038 --> 36:15.907
We just don't know,
but one day we might.

36:15.941 --> 36:19.578
REISS: In a way, the touchscreen
is a true window in itself,

36:19.611 --> 36:21.380
into the minds of these animals.

36:21.413 --> 36:25.083
I think technology can make
what's invisible to us

36:25.116 --> 36:26.518
perhaps more visible;

36:26.552 --> 36:29.688
what's inaudible to us
more audible.

36:29.721 --> 36:31.423
MARCELO MAGNASCO:
If we were to succeed,

36:31.457 --> 36:34.059
we would succeed in actually

36:34.092 --> 36:36.862
not being alone
in the universe anymore,

36:36.895 --> 36:38.997
which is a pretty sweet thought.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.599
NARRATOR: And that's why

36:40.632 --> 36:44.536
the Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence, or SETI Institute,

36:44.570 --> 36:46.272
has been tracking
her work with dolphins.

36:46.305 --> 36:49.441
The challenges she faces are
the same ones they anticipate

36:49.475 --> 36:52.511
they'll face
when aliens show up.

36:52.544 --> 36:53.845
We'll need a plan.

36:53.879 --> 36:57.549
And this technology
just may be the answer.

36:57.583 --> 37:00.452
REISS: The technology that we're
developing in these projects

37:00.486 --> 37:03.188
will enable us to see better,
to hear better,

37:03.221 --> 37:07.593
to understand better, and
to empathize more and care more,

37:07.626 --> 37:09.060
once we have that knowledge.

37:09.094 --> 37:12.964
You know, with knowledge
comes great responsibility.

37:12.998 --> 37:14.266
NARRATOR: It certainly does.

37:14.300 --> 37:16.402
I couldn't have said it
better myself.

37:16.435 --> 37:19.405
THURSTON: There is a potential
for a shared connection

37:19.438 --> 37:21.407
and a shared mindset.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.542
FARSAD:
With an interspecies Internet,

37:23.575 --> 37:25.043
we're sort of headed

37:25.076 --> 37:29.615
in this kind of universal
one-language scenario.

37:29.648 --> 37:33.752
So if you've ever wanted
to talk to a walrus,

37:33.785 --> 37:36.755
in the future,
you could do that.

37:36.788 --> 37:40.058
THURSTON: That could be
pretty magical.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.593
NARRATOR: Pretty magical indeed.

37:41.627 --> 37:44.129
In the future, we may not agree
with dolphins or aliens,

37:44.162 --> 37:46.665
or even walruses on anything.

37:46.698 --> 37:48.667
But as long as
we're communicating,

37:48.700 --> 37:52.237
there is always an opportunity
for greater understanding,

37:52.270 --> 37:54.673
greater empathy,
and greater connection.

37:54.706 --> 37:57.509
And as we travel deeper
and deeper into the future,

37:57.543 --> 37:59.411
we'll need to master
communication

37:59.445 --> 38:01.079
with all sentient beings

38:01.112 --> 38:06.184
if we ever hope to build our own
Tower of Babel in the future.

38:06.217 --> 38:07.686
But we're not there yet.

38:07.719 --> 38:10.021
We're going to connect
on a whole other level.

38:10.055 --> 38:12.624
If you thought losing
your privacy was a big deal,

38:12.658 --> 38:16.462
the final step is going to be
a big pill to swallow.

38:16.495 --> 38:18.664
DVORSKY: You're starting
to lose the individual,

38:18.697 --> 38:19.865
and you're starting to now gain

38:19.898 --> 38:22.167
in this kind of
massive collectivity,

38:22.200 --> 38:24.870
this, this entity that
kind of maybe even thinks

38:24.903 --> 38:28.173
and has impulses and tendencies
toward certain direction.

38:28.206 --> 38:30.442
The sum of its intelligence
would hopefully be greater

38:30.476 --> 38:32.811
than the sum of its parts.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.846
THURSTON: That's going
to change politics, right?

38:34.880 --> 38:37.182
That's going to change
relationships.

38:37.215 --> 38:39.618
Could you merge minds?

38:39.651 --> 38:41.553
NARRATOR: Oh, yes, we can,
and we will.

38:41.587 --> 38:44.022
In the Year Million era
we'll take the final plunge

38:44.055 --> 38:47.359
and shed our ego, our sense
of self, our individuality,

38:47.393 --> 38:49.795
and join together
in a single consciousness.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.730
It's a high-bandwidth
blending of our mind

38:51.763 --> 38:53.732
that creates its own
super intelligence,

38:53.765 --> 38:57.669
a consciousness of which each
person is just one small part.

38:57.703 --> 39:01.272
Say hello to your future
in the hive mind.

39:10.115 --> 39:11.883
NARRATOR: We're almost
at the end of our journey

39:11.917 --> 39:13.251
to Year Million

39:13.284 --> 39:17.723
and that future version of
a Tower of Babel to the heavens.

39:17.756 --> 39:20.225
And the final step in
our communication evolution

39:20.258 --> 39:21.893
is a doozy.

39:21.927 --> 39:23.161
Yep, you got it.

39:23.194 --> 39:25.196
In the Year Million we're not
just communicating

39:25.230 --> 39:26.998
telepathically mind-to-mind,

39:27.032 --> 39:29.601
using our hyper-connectivity
to swarm together

39:29.635 --> 39:32.203
and increase our intelligence
a thousand-fold.

39:32.237 --> 39:36.174
The final step will be when we
finally shed our sense of self

39:36.207 --> 39:37.743
and individuality

39:37.776 --> 39:42.914
and merge our minds together
into a single consciousness.

39:45.951 --> 39:47.753
DVORSKY: As we become
progressively interconnected

39:47.786 --> 39:49.054
with each other,

39:49.087 --> 39:51.423
lines that separate one brain
from another brain

39:51.457 --> 39:53.425
will become
increasingly blurred.

39:53.459 --> 39:54.893
And if you can imagine,
you know,

39:54.926 --> 39:57.362
hundreds or if not even
thousands of individuals,

39:57.395 --> 39:59.064
interlinked in this way,

39:59.097 --> 40:02.568
you're going to have what's
referred to as the hive mind.

40:02.601 --> 40:04.903
NARRATOR: Whoa, the hive mind.

40:04.936 --> 40:06.371
It sounds scary,

40:06.404 --> 40:09.741
and it just might be, and
we'll get to that in a minute.

40:09.775 --> 40:13.244
But it could also be
incredibly empowering.

40:13.278 --> 40:14.880
NEWITZ: Basically
like what we do

40:14.913 --> 40:16.648
when we create
a computer cluster,

40:16.682 --> 40:18.049
putting all the computers
together

40:18.083 --> 40:19.417
and having them work together

40:19.451 --> 40:22.488
allows them to do bigger
and tougher problems.

40:22.521 --> 40:23.922
NARRATOR: You might say
to yourself

40:23.955 --> 40:25.624
that sounds a lot like
the swarm intelligence

40:25.657 --> 40:28.059
we talked about,
but they are very different.

40:28.093 --> 40:30.629
Swarm intelligence
is decentralized.

40:30.662 --> 40:33.632
We will still have our own
identity, a sense of self.

40:33.665 --> 40:35.967
Hive mind is a paradigm shift.

40:36.001 --> 40:38.904
We will let go of our egos
and come together

40:38.937 --> 40:41.239
to create a centralized
consciousness.

40:41.272 --> 40:43.274
When you connect
to the hive mind,

40:43.308 --> 40:46.311
you will share everything.

40:49.981 --> 40:52.818
NEWITZ: It could be a really
great experience at a concert,

40:52.851 --> 40:54.953
where like all of us
are feeling the same thing

40:54.986 --> 40:58.456
as we listen to
an awesome guitar solo.

40:58.490 --> 41:01.760
NARRATOR: Exactly,
like a concert.

41:01.793 --> 41:04.596
Speaking of which, remember
that concert we saw earlier?

41:04.630 --> 41:07.332
Our future family has become
part of the hive mind,

41:07.365 --> 41:11.136
and is experiencing a concert
through a single consciousness.

41:11.169 --> 41:12.470
BRIAN GREENE: If all those minds

41:12.504 --> 41:16.041
are in some computer
digital environment

41:16.074 --> 41:18.844
that allows them to interface
in a more profound way

41:18.877 --> 41:21.947
than the biological means that
we have at our disposal now,

41:21.980 --> 41:24.650
I can't help but think that
that would be a greater level

41:24.683 --> 41:27.385
of collective communication.

41:27.418 --> 41:28.620
NARRATOR: It would be.

41:28.654 --> 41:30.556
And that's why
they can be any part

41:30.589 --> 41:32.524
of this little concert
they desire.

41:32.558 --> 41:33.892
Plugged in like they are,

41:33.925 --> 41:36.294
their minds will create
a larger intelligence,

41:36.327 --> 41:37.963
a larger consciousness.

41:37.996 --> 41:40.465
Our whole idea of what
it means to be human

41:40.498 --> 41:42.133
will change drastically,

41:42.167 --> 41:45.503
because when we let go of
the ego, the self-preservation,

41:45.537 --> 41:48.006
the competition involved
with having a sense of self

41:48.039 --> 41:51.677
and come together as one, well,
then everything is possible.

41:51.710 --> 41:53.478
GREENE: There is something
very powerful

41:53.511 --> 41:56.314
of all minds working together.

41:56.347 --> 41:59.084
Maybe we'll find,
in this domain,

41:59.117 --> 42:01.720
that the notion of decision

42:01.753 --> 42:05.991
is not where we find
our individual footprint.

42:06.024 --> 42:09.494
Maybe our individual footprint
comes with an outlook

42:09.527 --> 42:12.664
or a perspective
that we hold dear,

42:12.698 --> 42:16.334
and only we as individuals
are aware of it, or know it.

42:16.367 --> 42:19.605
Maybe that will be enough,
perhaps.

42:19.638 --> 42:22.173
NEWITZ: I definitely think
it will radically impact

42:22.207 --> 42:25.577
what we think of as a self.

42:25.611 --> 42:27.078
NARRATOR: Take a moment,
breathe.

42:27.112 --> 42:29.748
I know, it's a big idea
to wrap your head around.

42:29.781 --> 42:31.416
Everything we think
makes us human

42:31.449 --> 42:33.585
is tied to our sense of self.

42:33.619 --> 42:36.021
Hive mind won't come
without sacrifice.

42:36.054 --> 42:38.223
It will take
a complete redefinition

42:38.256 --> 42:39.557
of what it means to be human.

42:39.591 --> 42:43.595
The question is,
will it be worth it?

42:43.629 --> 42:45.030
FARSAD: What feels dangerous
about the hive mind

42:45.063 --> 42:47.132
is that we'll all, like,
just know the same things

42:47.165 --> 42:49.601
and then we won't have
anything to talk about.

42:49.635 --> 42:53.104
It'll be so sad, because like
the whole point of life

42:53.138 --> 42:55.040
is to just like hang out
with your friends.

42:55.073 --> 42:57.643
It's like, talk some smack,
you know what I mean,

42:57.676 --> 43:00.278
and if you all already know
the thing, you know,

43:00.311 --> 43:01.613
there's no smack to talk,

43:01.647 --> 43:03.782
and that would be
very frustrating.

43:03.815 --> 43:05.583
NARRATOR: Frustrating indeed.

43:05.617 --> 43:08.654
What's life without some
good old-fashioned trash talk?

43:08.687 --> 43:10.622
Well, we just might find out.

43:10.656 --> 43:12.490
But what about our autonomy?

43:12.523 --> 43:14.559
When we mingle our minds,
what happens?

43:14.592 --> 43:16.161
Are we still you and me?

43:16.194 --> 43:18.396
Or do we become the same thing?

43:18.429 --> 43:23.334
NEWITZ: Any technology that
we use to mingle our minds

43:23.368 --> 43:26.404
could have good or bad effects.

43:26.437 --> 43:28.740
So you want to be able
to step back

43:28.774 --> 43:31.810
and be a little bit skeptical
of any kind of groupthink.

43:31.843 --> 43:33.478
MARQUIS-BOIRE:
There is the worry

43:33.511 --> 43:38.016
that this connected hive mind
can be used in sinister ways,

43:38.049 --> 43:40.185
depending on who's
in charge of it.

43:40.218 --> 43:42.187
NARRATOR: That's right, when
you're part of the hive mind,

43:42.220 --> 43:44.756
your mind, at least
in the traditional sense,

43:44.790 --> 43:46.692
might not be yours alone.

43:46.725 --> 43:49.828
KAKU: You're like a worker bee
in a gigantic hive.

43:49.861 --> 43:54.265
You have no individuality
whatsoever.

43:54.299 --> 43:56.534
MIRA: You know, if you think
about the Borg from Star Trek,

43:56.567 --> 43:57.769
the Borg is the hive mind.

43:57.803 --> 43:59.537
The Borg are a collective,

43:59.570 --> 44:03.208
so they think as a whole
and not as an individual.

44:03.241 --> 44:07.312
And in many ways individuality
is what makes us feel human.

44:07.345 --> 44:12.317
To have that stripped away and
become part of a hive collective

44:12.350 --> 44:15.120
is one of the more terrifying
things you could do.

44:15.153 --> 44:16.955
It's like joining a cult.

44:16.988 --> 44:20.225
NEWITZ: The perfect way to get
a zombie army would be

44:20.258 --> 44:21.860
string all their brains
together,

44:21.893 --> 44:24.229
hook them up to somebody who
really knows what they're doing,

44:24.262 --> 44:25.731
and just blasts their brains

44:25.764 --> 44:28.499
with like whatever information
they want to give them.

44:28.533 --> 44:31.302
You know, now you must
do this labor

44:31.336 --> 44:34.205
in order to exalt the great one.

44:34.239 --> 44:36.007
NARRATOR: That doesn't
sound good at all.

44:36.041 --> 44:37.175
What if I want out?

44:37.208 --> 44:40.578
Is there some sort of
hive mind eject button?

44:40.611 --> 44:42.047
DVORSKY: One would hope,
for example,

44:42.080 --> 44:44.015
that you could perhaps
pull out of the hive mind,

44:44.049 --> 44:46.251
that you could remove
yourself from the grid.

44:46.284 --> 44:47.753
We struggle with this today,

44:47.786 --> 44:49.888
we turn off our phones
or go into airplane mode,

44:49.921 --> 44:51.656
and we feel like
we're naked somehow,

44:51.689 --> 44:53.358
or that somehow we're
disconnected from the world.

44:53.391 --> 44:55.393
Imagine how terrifying
or disconcerting it would be

44:55.426 --> 44:58.730
in the future, if we suddenly,
after engaging in a hive mind,

44:58.764 --> 45:01.366
we pulled our self out of it.

45:01.399 --> 45:02.667
NARRATOR: The hive mind
sounds like

45:02.700 --> 45:04.602
it could be
a deeply oppressive place,

45:04.635 --> 45:07.405
like North Korea
but on steroids.

45:07.438 --> 45:09.240
That's the worst-case scenario.

45:09.274 --> 45:12.744
KAKU: But another possibility
is that it is freedom,

45:12.778 --> 45:14.079
a world of enlightenment,

45:14.112 --> 45:17.182
a world of knowledge
and prosperity.

45:17.215 --> 45:19.250
NARRATOR: When we're all joined
together as one,

45:19.284 --> 45:23.088
could we finally eliminate
conflict, wars and suffering?

45:23.121 --> 45:25.623
THURSTON: And if you and I
are the same,

45:25.656 --> 45:28.894
then when I hurt you,
I literally hurt myself.

45:28.927 --> 45:33.064
That changes war, that changes
anger, that changes love.

45:33.098 --> 45:37.102
'Cause when I love you,
I love myself.

45:37.135 --> 45:38.403
ROSENBERG: We could evolve
into something

45:38.436 --> 45:39.971
that we can't even conceive,

45:40.005 --> 45:42.974
into a different
type of creature.

45:43.008 --> 45:44.876
This super-organism.

45:44.910 --> 45:47.078
NARRATOR: Might the hive mind
even be necessary

45:47.112 --> 45:48.479
for our survival?

45:48.513 --> 45:50.315
I mean, we've come
this far alone.

45:50.348 --> 45:51.817
But you know the old saying,

45:51.850 --> 45:54.986
divided we fall
and united we stand.

45:55.020 --> 45:58.089
GREENE: To my mind, the only way
that we survive

45:58.123 --> 45:59.257
into the far future,

45:59.290 --> 46:02.593
is to bring us all together
in some manner

46:02.627 --> 46:05.931
that leverages the whole
collective consciousness

46:05.964 --> 46:10.335
in a way that's more powerful
than the individual minds alone.

46:10.368 --> 46:11.736
THURSTON:
I think that's exciting.

46:11.769 --> 46:15.240
I think it's weird, though.

46:15.273 --> 46:18.109
SANDBERG: I imagine it
as a vast coral reef.

46:18.143 --> 46:21.346
Explosion of new forms,
new kinds of minds,

46:21.379 --> 46:23.614
new kind of consciousness.

46:23.648 --> 46:25.750
I can't imagine
any of the details.

46:25.783 --> 46:28.019
Because I think most of them
would be beyond

46:28.053 --> 46:29.921
my puny human brain.

46:29.955 --> 46:32.858
Just like an ant cannot
understand a city,

46:32.891 --> 46:36.127
we cannot understand
Year Million.

46:36.161 --> 46:40.698
But we can see something there,
beyond the clouds.

46:40.731 --> 46:42.467
NARRATOR: That is the future
we're barreling toward

46:42.500 --> 46:43.935
in Year Million.

46:43.969 --> 46:46.037
When we are one with animals,
extraterrestrials,

46:46.071 --> 46:47.873
and most importantly,
each other,

46:47.906 --> 46:51.376
then beyond the clouds may be
exactly where we find ourselves.

46:51.409 --> 46:55.680
That's right, we'll be building
a new future, our own tower,

46:55.713 --> 46:58.116
perhaps in a far-off
distant galaxy,

46:58.149 --> 46:59.217
a gleaming testament

46:59.250 --> 47:01.819
to our brilliant ingenuity
and creativity.

47:01.853 --> 47:03.354
We're headed for the stars.

47:03.388 --> 47:04.722
And that will be possible

47:04.755 --> 47:06.858
because of the coming
communication revolution

47:06.892 --> 47:08.626
that will take
human intelligence

47:08.659 --> 47:11.162
into the stratosphere.
