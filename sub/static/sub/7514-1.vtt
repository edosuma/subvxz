03:27.724 --> 03:32.457
Long ago, in the days
of the great ice mountains...

03:33.296 --> 03:38.233
...the first of our people followed
the herds of game into a new land.

03:40.470 --> 03:43.337
There was a girl child among them...

03:44.207 --> 03:47.301
...and she was called Ayla.

03:48.945 --> 03:51.971
The legends still speak of her.

04:23.546 --> 04:24.843
Ayla!

04:25.048 --> 04:27.482
Mama!

04:33.856 --> 04:35.346
Ayla!

04:52.809 --> 04:54.299
Mama!

06:04.080 --> 06:06.241
Before our people came...

06:06.649 --> 06:09.675
...this had been
the land of the old ones.

06:09.886 --> 06:12.753
The Clan of the Cave Bear.

06:18.561 --> 06:22.497
When the Earth shook,
they had lost their home.

06:23.266 --> 06:25.427
Many had died.

06:26.636 --> 06:30.538
But Brun, the leader,
still had with him Broud...

06:30.740 --> 06:33.834
...the son of his mate,
who would be leader after him.

06:35.378 --> 06:38.472
Then came Creb, the great Mog-ur...

06:38.681 --> 06:40.706
...the crippled holy man.

06:42.885 --> 06:46.912
And Iza, his sister,
the medicine woman.

06:48.458 --> 06:49.891
Without a cave...

06:50.093 --> 06:52.118
...the Clan was weak.

06:52.662 --> 06:56.325
They knew that soon the wind spirits
would bring snow.

06:56.532 --> 06:59.524
And snow would bring death.

09:52.375 --> 09:53.672
lza.

10:24.307 --> 10:25.535
Broud.

10:37.286 --> 10:38.548
lza.

11:14.590 --> 11:19.220
The child that Iza nursed
was one of us. The new people.

11:19.428 --> 11:22.920
The first the Clan of
the Cave Bear had ever seen.

11:23.132 --> 11:26.397
She was proof of the tales
they had long heard...

11:26.602 --> 11:28.092
...of "the Others."

11:28.304 --> 11:32.604
The strange ones who threatened
the world which had always been theirs.

11:34.310 --> 11:37.711
At sunset, they called
to the spirits to help them...

11:37.913 --> 11:39.881
...for they were afraid.

12:19.555 --> 12:20.385
Creb.

12:35.304 --> 12:36.566
Creb.

12:39.108 --> 12:40.132
Grub.

12:43.879 --> 12:45.312
Creb.

12:49.819 --> 12:51.081
lza.

12:57.726 --> 12:58.715
Ayla.

13:24.453 --> 13:25.750
Mog-ur.

13:53.449 --> 13:54.381
Broud.

13:55.751 --> 13:57.343
Broud!

14:22.478 --> 14:27.006
As the days passed, and still
they had not found a cave...

14:27.316 --> 14:30.149
...many were sure that some
dark spirit...

14:30.352 --> 14:33.719
...had put the child, Ayla,
in their path.

14:33.923 --> 14:38.360
She was of the Others
and should have been left to die.

14:38.561 --> 14:41.530
That was what the memories told them.

14:41.730 --> 14:43.925
It was the memories
that ruled the Clan.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.863
The ancient knowledge
that each was born with.

14:47.069 --> 14:51.938
The voices of the past that
could not be disobeyed or changed.

14:54.009 --> 14:56.910
Ayla did not have the memories.

14:57.479 --> 15:02.109
Iza knew the Clan would not
let her keep the child much longer.

19:00.756 --> 19:04.749
For many seasons, the Clan
lived in this new cave.

19:04.960 --> 19:07.986
And Ayla was allowed
to stay among them.

19:08.197 --> 19:10.131
Iza and Creb protected her...

19:10.332 --> 19:13.961
...and raised her with Iza's
own daughter, Uba.

19:14.169 --> 19:16.763
Ayla tried to be a child
of the Clan.

19:16.972 --> 19:20.237
But she knew that to Broud
and many others...

19:20.442 --> 19:24.242
...she was still a threat
to the Clan's unchanging ways.

19:25.614 --> 19:29.641
Even the spirits seemed
to have no place for her.

19:35.490 --> 19:36.388
Ayla.

19:37.392 --> 19:38.791
Ebra.

19:52.474 --> 19:53.498
Ayla!

25:08.490 --> 25:10.151
Iza was afraid.

25:10.358 --> 25:13.816
She knew that Broud would soon be made
a hunter of the Clan...

25:14.029 --> 25:17.590
...and Ayla would not be safe.

25:17.799 --> 25:20.859
She did not have
an animal totem to protect her...

25:21.069 --> 25:23.469
...as all Clan people did.

25:23.672 --> 25:28.609
And only Creb, the Mog-ur,
knew the magic to find her one.

25:30.145 --> 25:32.272
But as he climbed the mountain...

25:32.480 --> 25:35.745
...he was not sure the spirits
would grant a protector...

25:35.951 --> 25:38.511
...to this child of the Others.

32:58.960 --> 33:03.294
Iza knew that one day
she and Creb would be gone...

33:03.498 --> 33:07.298
...and that without them,
Ayla would be alone.

33:07.502 --> 33:10.562
And so she taught Ayla
the healing magic...

33:10.772 --> 33:15.505
...to give her a place in the Clan
when that day came.

41:33.340 --> 41:35.706
Ayla knew the punishment...

41:35.910 --> 41:39.243
...for a woman who touched
a hunting weapon...

41:39.446 --> 41:41.004
...was death.

42:35.169 --> 42:36.158
Brun!

46:26.233 --> 46:30.067
While gathering herbs for
Iza's medicine, Ayla had found...

46:30.270 --> 46:32.465
...a small cave in the forest.

46:33.507 --> 46:35.566
Now she went there whenever she could...

46:36.243 --> 46:40.270
...to escape from Broud, and be alone.

54:42.195 --> 54:44.629
Brac? Brac!

55:03.817 --> 55:04.943
Mama!

56:51.491 --> 56:53.152
Ayla had used the sling.

56:54.160 --> 56:58.688
And the memory said she should be
cursed with a silent death forever.

57:06.773 --> 57:08.968
But because she had saved
the child, Brac...

57:09.609 --> 57:13.568
...she would be sent away
for only one turning of the moon.

57:17.984 --> 57:19.349
In all the memories...

57:19.552 --> 57:23.352
...no one had ever returned
from the "land of the dead."

57:24.057 --> 57:27.424
And Ayla was a woman carrying a child.

57:32.632 --> 57:36.864
To the Clan, she was now a spirit.

57:37.070 --> 57:38.833
Even to look at her...

57:39.038 --> 57:40.801
...would bring evil among them.

01:08:03.362 --> 01:08:06.695
Ayla and the child were spared.

01:08:07.733 --> 01:08:09.826
Ayla was to be
a woman of the Clan...

01:08:10.035 --> 01:08:11.969
...in all ways but one.

01:08:13.139 --> 01:08:15.266
From that day on, she was...

01:08:15.474 --> 01:08:17.908
..."the woman who hunts."

01:08:36.462 --> 01:08:38.987
And Creb called the child Durc.

01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:41.189
And the Clan accepted him.

01:08:41.399 --> 01:08:42.731
For as time passed...

01:08:43.368 --> 01:08:47.897
...they saw he had the memories
and knew the Clan way.

01:08:55.447 --> 01:08:57.506
In Durc's fourth summer...

01:08:57.716 --> 01:09:00.879
...a call came for
a gathering of all the Clans.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:05.781
Many of the young men
had become hunters...

01:09:06.091 --> 01:09:08.354
...and the leaders were growing old.

01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:12.261
It was time for the change.

01:10:37.683 --> 01:10:41.016
The scattered Clans trekked
to the Great Gathering.

01:10:41.754 --> 01:10:43.688
It would be a time for trading...

01:10:43.889 --> 01:10:47.290
...for choosing new leaders,
for finding mates.

01:10:48.827 --> 01:10:53.161
And Ayla will be the medicine woman
of the Clan of the Cave Bear.

01:15:11.657 --> 01:15:15.252
The spirits were called to
the sacred Ceremony of the Bear.

01:15:16.862 --> 01:15:20.491
Broud and the other
young hunters were ready.

01:15:23.435 --> 01:15:25.596
If they survived...

01:15:26.271 --> 01:15:30.002
...the bear's spirit would carry
their names to the sky.

01:15:30.509 --> 01:15:33.069
And they would be the new leaders.

01:19:43.028 --> 01:19:46.828
With the Mog-urs' strongest magic,
Creb reached out to Ayla.

01:19:51.903 --> 01:19:54.838
The same image filled their minds.

01:20:05.984 --> 01:20:10.250
She saw two animals walk
from the smoke of the sacred fire.

01:20:10.455 --> 01:20:14.721
The great Cave Bear
and her own Lion Spirit.

01:20:25.136 --> 01:20:27.263
Then she saw Durc.

01:20:34.646 --> 01:20:36.341
The animals turned.

01:20:36.815 --> 01:20:39.079
And before the magic was gone...

01:20:39.518 --> 01:20:43.420
...she saw that
the lion walked alone.

01:21:03.041 --> 01:21:05.441
Ayla felt the lion's strength.

01:21:05.644 --> 01:21:10.377
She finally knew that, like him,
she must find her destiny on her own.

01:21:11.182 --> 01:21:15.312
But she could not take the lion's path
while Durc was still so young.

01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:17.784
He would not survive the journey.

01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:21.555
She would wait for a sign
from the spirits.

01:33:20.044 --> 01:33:21.511
Mama!

01:33:48.339 --> 01:33:52.002
She had spoken out for Creb
because she loved him.

01:33:52.209 --> 01:33:54.700
The sign had come.

01:33:55.813 --> 01:33:58.213
Finally, she understood the vision.

01:33:58.749 --> 01:34:00.307
Durc was of the Clan.

01:34:00.518 --> 01:34:03.112
And one day he would be their leader.

01:34:03.854 --> 01:34:06.084
She must find her own people.

01:34:06.290 --> 01:34:08.019
She must walk alone.

01:34:08.893 --> 01:34:13.023
Everything she had lived through
had prepared her for this journey.

01:34:13.230 --> 01:34:15.323
And she was not afraid.

01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:18.231
For the first time...

01:34:18.436 --> 01:34:22.202
...Ayla felt the strength
of her own spirit.
