<i>Previously on Banshee...</i>

00:01.655 --> 00:02.875
Let the girl go.

00:06.284 --> 00:07.662
The spirit horse
is coming for me.

00:08.271 --> 00:10.751
My son will fulfill my promises.

00:10.776 --> 00:13.255
But if he breaks it,
it won't be a good day for the tribe.

00:15.632 --> 00:17.199
Sorry. I've been
back in the ring.

00:17.224 --> 00:19.271
I've lost count
of the people I hurt.

00:19.296 --> 00:20.931
You have no idea what
that does to you.

00:20.956 --> 00:22.895
Why don't you just admit
that you like being bad?

00:23.119 --> 00:24.898
That accent,
where are you from?

00:24.923 --> 00:27.004
I'd rather talk about
where I am.

00:27.034 --> 00:28.632
Just get everything out
on the table?

00:28.655 --> 00:30.655
Tell me about the Sheriff.

Mama?

04:20.719 --> 04:23.621
No, no, no.
Mama!

04:23.655 --> 04:25.522
No.

04:25.557 --> 04:27.291
Don't let them
do this.

04:27.325 --> 04:30.360
Mama, please!
Please, Mama, please!

04:35.567 --> 04:37.401
Don't do this, Father.

04:40.372 --> 04:42.372
You did this.

04:45.276 --> 04:46.943
<i>Daddy!</i>

04:46.978 --> 04:48.544
You did this!

04:53.617 --> 04:55.985
Mama!

04:56.019 --> 04:58.755
<i>Mama,</i>
<i>don't do this to me!</i>

04:58.789 --> 05:01.691
Mama.

05:01.725 --> 05:04.060
Please.

05:49.506 --> 05:50.973
Don't go.

05:51.008 --> 05:52.809
Please don't.

05:54.211 --> 05:56.913
- Ana.
- Don't.

05:56.947 --> 05:58.614
We can leave.

05:58.648 --> 06:01.650
Ana, we-- we can
go anywhere.

06:03.120 --> 06:05.922
This <i>is</i> my anywhere.

06:09.293 --> 06:13.028
<i>Carrie Hopewell</i>
<i>is not real.</i>

06:13.063 --> 06:15.063
She's a hiding place.

06:15.131 --> 06:18.500
You have to let me go.

06:18.534 --> 06:20.869
There's nothing in this world
that makes sense

06:20.903 --> 06:23.138
if there's no you and me.

06:23.172 --> 06:25.206
Nothing.

06:25.240 --> 06:27.442
You know that,
the same way I do.

06:27.476 --> 06:30.244
You're still in there.
I know you are.

06:30.279 --> 06:32.213
<i>The whole time</i>
<i>I was in prison,</i>

06:32.247 --> 06:34.782
you know
what kept me alive?

06:34.817 --> 06:38.119
You, not Carrie Hopewell.

06:38.153 --> 06:40.388
Ana-- your Ana is dead.

06:40.422 --> 06:42.190
<i>What we had back then,</i>
<i>that's dead.</i>

06:42.224 --> 06:43.992
- <i>That's what's not real anymore.</i>
- <i>No.</i>

06:44.026 --> 06:46.127
- This is what's real.
- You're wrong!

06:46.161 --> 06:48.229
Things change.

06:48.263 --> 06:50.631
I changed.

06:50.665 --> 06:52.233
I know how much
you loved me.

06:52.267 --> 06:54.235
I loved you just like that,
but I don't anymore.

06:54.269 --> 06:56.404
- I'm not Ana anymore.
- Yes, you are!

06:56.438 --> 06:59.174
You were last night
and I fuckin' know that!

06:59.208 --> 07:01.643
Last night?

07:04.880 --> 07:08.617
You and I never got
a chance to say goodbye.

07:08.651 --> 07:10.919
That's what last night was--
it was goodbye.

07:10.954 --> 07:13.355
And now you have
to move on.

07:13.389 --> 07:15.356
What, just like that?

07:15.391 --> 07:16.691
I went to prison for you.

07:16.726 --> 07:18.893
<i>I know.</i>
<i>It's not fair.</i>

07:18.928 --> 07:21.395
I'm sorry, but I have
a family to protect.

07:21.429 --> 07:24.331
It's my family!

07:33.074 --> 07:36.210
I knew she was mine
the first moment I saw her.

07:39.781 --> 07:41.982
Say it.

07:44.452 --> 07:46.352
She's yours.

07:48.255 --> 07:50.189
<i>She is.</i>

07:50.223 --> 07:52.758
<i>She's yours.</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

07:57.229 --> 07:59.597
<i>What did you</i>
<i>tell Gordon?</i>

08:01.133 --> 08:04.269
<i>Well, he must have known</i>
<i>she wasn't his.</i>

08:07.040 --> 08:09.475
I told him
you were dead.

08:10.777 --> 08:13.212
- Perfect.
- Okay?

08:14.782 --> 08:17.850
I was broke and I was pregnant
and I was all alone.

08:17.884 --> 08:19.351
I couldn't fence
the diamonds.

08:19.386 --> 08:22.387
The minute they hit the street,
Rabbit would have been all over me.

08:22.422 --> 08:24.123
Job had given me Carrie,
but I had to find

08:24.157 --> 08:27.393
a safe place to stop.

08:27.427 --> 08:29.695
And Gordon--

08:29.730 --> 08:31.330
he just got out
of the Marines

08:31.365 --> 08:33.666
and I was a waitress and he
always came to my restaurant.

08:33.700 --> 08:35.134
I don't wanna hear
this shit.

08:35.168 --> 08:38.304
I had to find a safe home
for your daughter!

08:38.337 --> 08:41.240
<i>I didn't fall for him.</i>

08:41.274 --> 08:43.308
I was waiting for you.

08:47.414 --> 08:50.116
Deva came, this beautiful
little girl.

08:50.150 --> 08:52.018
My little girl.

08:53.221 --> 08:55.389
He raised her
like his own.

08:55.423 --> 08:57.791
She's not his.

08:57.826 --> 08:59.994
She's mine.

09:03.899 --> 09:06.367
<i>It's not about</i>
<i>you and me anymore.</i>

09:10.739 --> 09:12.407
How many lives
are you willing to destroy

09:12.441 --> 09:15.176
to take back
what you think is yours?

09:17.914 --> 09:20.415
Look...

09:22.251 --> 09:25.754
do you honestly think Deva
would be better off with you?

09:28.825 --> 09:32.060
I think she deserves
to know the truth.

09:32.095 --> 09:34.496
Look at you.

09:35.565 --> 09:38.201
Look at me.

09:38.235 --> 09:41.938
<i>The last thing any of us needs</i>
<i>is the truth.</i>

09:43.307 --> 09:45.241
<i>You say you love me.</i>

09:46.644 --> 09:48.645
<i>If that's true,</i>

09:48.679 --> 09:51.481
then the best thing
you could do is leave here

09:51.515 --> 09:53.283
and forget about
Deva and me.

09:58.657 --> 10:00.891
If I don't?

10:05.496 --> 10:07.497
Then what?

10:12.837 --> 10:14.838
You've already
turned me into Rabbit.

10:17.574 --> 10:20.109
If you don't,
I'll kill you myself.

10:42.031 --> 10:46.134
Stop following me, damn it.
You can't keep doing--

10:47.770 --> 10:49.470
Hello, Ana.

10:50.606 --> 10:52.573
Olek.

10:55.277 --> 10:58.512
Your father would like
to see you.

10:58.546 --> 11:00.247
But he did say

11:00.281 --> 11:02.248
I could kill you
if you became a problem.

11:02.283 --> 11:05.685
Are you going
to be a problem?

11:05.719 --> 11:07.720
No.

11:09.389 --> 11:12.658
You look good, Ana.

11:12.692 --> 11:15.160
- He has missed you terribly.
- He's insane.

11:15.195 --> 11:16.729
He loves his daughter.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.564
Olek, you can't
bring me to him.

11:18.598 --> 11:22.067
- Please.
- We'll take my car.

11:22.101 --> 11:23.802
- Get in.
- I'm not getting in there.

11:23.836 --> 11:25.437
- Olek--
- Yes, you are.

11:33.646 --> 11:35.580
Hey, Olek.

11:51.132 --> 11:53.701
You can stay here
as long as you like.

11:53.735 --> 11:55.136
Thank you.

11:55.170 --> 11:58.506
I really didn't have
anywhere else to go.

11:58.540 --> 12:01.875
I'd have been offended
if you went anywhere else.

12:08.515 --> 12:11.150
I was just 19
when I left.

12:11.184 --> 12:13.752
These men,
thugs, really,

12:13.786 --> 12:16.254
were preying on
our farmers' produce wagons.

12:16.289 --> 12:19.224
They wanted us
to pay protection money.

12:19.258 --> 12:21.960
But anyway, I got tired
of turning the other cheek,

12:21.994 --> 12:23.629
so one day, I didn't.

12:23.663 --> 12:28.033
I took three of them apart
with an old ball peen hammer.

12:28.067 --> 12:29.700
You should have seen
the looks on their faces

12:29.735 --> 12:31.969
when this Amish kid
came at them.

12:32.004 --> 12:34.138
Not what they expected.

12:34.173 --> 12:37.075
But the elders
condemned my actions,

12:37.109 --> 12:40.612
wanted me to show contrition
for defending them.

12:42.549 --> 12:44.750
I guess I wasn't built
for contrition.

12:51.892 --> 12:55.995
Whatever happens,
you'll always have a home here.

12:56.029 --> 12:58.731
Thank you.

12:58.765 --> 13:00.933
Why don't you get
yourself settled?

13:00.968 --> 13:02.568
I'll leave you
some lunch downstairs.

13:02.602 --> 13:04.069
I've got to run out
for a few hours.

13:04.104 --> 13:06.906
When I come back, we can
talk all this through.

13:06.940 --> 13:09.875
- Okay?
- Okay.

13:54.188 --> 13:56.255
He's going
to torture you.

13:56.290 --> 13:58.191
You will beg
to be killed.

13:58.225 --> 14:01.394
Why don't we skip
all the ominous threats

14:01.429 --> 14:05.165
and macho bullshit,
stick to the facts?

14:06.435 --> 14:08.169
<i>Good.</i>

14:08.203 --> 14:12.507
- Is Rabbit here?
- No, but he's coming.

14:15.278 --> 14:17.780
Well, he hasn't made
any calls today.

14:17.814 --> 14:20.483
No texts, nothing.

14:20.517 --> 14:22.251
He knows where I am.

14:34.198 --> 14:35.698
Okay, English, please.

14:35.732 --> 14:38.534
- Fuck you!
- That's better, thanks.

14:40.337 --> 14:41.771
Great.

14:41.805 --> 14:43.940
Now look what you've done.

15:52.444 --> 15:55.346
What the fuck
are you hiding?

15:59.619 --> 16:02.187
Bullshit!

16:17.906 --> 16:20.641
I asked you to leave.
I begged you.

16:20.675 --> 16:22.776
He's gonna kill all of us.

16:24.546 --> 16:27.015
- Not if I kill him first.
- Oh, please.

16:27.049 --> 16:28.850
Think about it.

16:28.884 --> 16:30.385
Olek-- he put you
in the trunk.

16:30.420 --> 16:32.421
He didn't kill you.
He was here to bring you back.

16:32.455 --> 16:34.256
Rabbit must want you
before me.

16:34.290 --> 16:36.325
Olek hasn't
checked in yet.

16:36.359 --> 16:38.893
- That buys us some time.
- Okay. Time for what?

16:38.928 --> 16:40.562
We go to New York,
we take him out.

16:40.596 --> 16:42.430
- Jesus Christ.
- We storm the castle.

16:42.465 --> 16:44.399
- <i>It's the last thing he's going to expect.</i>
- Because it's suicide.

16:44.433 --> 16:47.969
- So is staying here, Ana.
- He's gonna be waiting for us.

16:48.003 --> 16:52.607
Oh, my God,
my babies, Gordon--

16:55.611 --> 16:57.044
I've put them all
in danger.

16:57.079 --> 17:00.015
- Yeah, you have.
- Well, we were safe until you got here.

17:00.049 --> 17:02.550
How many other mothers
carry guns in their purse?

17:02.585 --> 17:04.419
Or fake license plates
in their car?

17:04.453 --> 17:06.054
You knew this day
was coming.

17:06.088 --> 17:08.056
You've known it every day
since the day you landed here.

17:08.089 --> 17:10.692
<i>And every one of those days</i>
<i>you lied to your family,</i>

17:10.726 --> 17:12.661
not me.

17:15.763 --> 17:18.031
<i>Carrie Hopewell</i>
<i>was never built to last.</i>

17:19.134 --> 17:20.601
You've been
on borrowed time

17:20.636 --> 17:23.805
since you got here
and you know it.

17:24.807 --> 17:27.308
I love my family.

17:27.343 --> 17:29.276
I'd die
to keep them safe.

17:29.311 --> 17:33.414
Hey, I won't let
anything happen.

17:33.448 --> 17:35.282
Promise.

17:41.923 --> 17:45.592
This room smells of sex.

17:45.626 --> 17:47.427
I wonder,

17:47.461 --> 17:51.898
is it still adultery
if your marriage is a lie?

17:51.932 --> 17:54.200
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:54.234 --> 17:57.069
Always sneaking around,
you two.

17:57.103 --> 18:00.906
Even back then,
always this forbidden love,

18:00.941 --> 18:02.575
like Shakespeare.

18:02.609 --> 18:04.676
- So romantic.
- We're getting off topic here.

18:04.711 --> 18:08.180
<i>I wonder, how do</i>
<i>you think he knew?</i>

18:08.214 --> 18:09.748
What?

18:09.782 --> 18:13.218
How did he find out?
Rabbit.

18:13.252 --> 18:16.554
You were so careful
all the time.

18:17.757 --> 18:19.891
The way you met
in his apartment,

18:19.925 --> 18:24.495
the hours you kept,
the special phones you had.

18:24.529 --> 18:28.932
Oh, yeah, I knew
about the phones.

18:28.966 --> 18:31.168
You're the one
who told him.

18:31.202 --> 18:33.570
Yes.

18:48.052 --> 18:50.386
Who's here?

18:50.421 --> 18:53.023
- Who's here?
- Uh-oh.

18:58.963 --> 19:00.730
- Who is it?
<i>- Shit.</i>

19:00.764 --> 19:02.466
Uh, it's no one.
It's no one.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.668
I'll take care of it.

19:04.703 --> 19:07.371
Keep an eye on him,
all right?

19:09.908 --> 19:12.544
- Hey.
- Hey. I was just coming to see you.

19:12.578 --> 19:15.347
Yeah, listen, um, I'm kind of
busy right now.

19:15.381 --> 19:18.083
- Can we do this later?
- I really need to talk to you.

19:18.118 --> 19:21.220
Okay, look, you just can't
be here right now.

19:21.254 --> 19:24.056
I've been hearing that
a lot today.

19:26.693 --> 19:29.227
Aw, shit.

19:32.565 --> 19:34.333
I'll-- I'll give
you a lift.

19:34.367 --> 19:37.135
- Come on.
- To where?

19:42.308 --> 19:44.609
I know it may not
seem this way,

19:44.643 --> 19:46.878
but your father
loves you very deeply.

19:48.614 --> 19:52.684
He will still
kill you, I think.

19:52.718 --> 19:55.887
But this is what
love does, right?

19:55.921 --> 19:58.856
- It kills us.
- It's gonna kill you.

19:58.890 --> 19:59.961
What?

19:59.986 --> 20:02.314
You think I don't remember
how you used to look at me?

20:03.962 --> 20:07.064
How you would hug and kiss me
every time you saw me?

20:11.335 --> 20:15.371
That's why you told
Rabbit about us.

20:15.405 --> 20:18.740
Because you thought it would
clear the field for you.

20:18.774 --> 20:21.542
And that's why
you came here alone.

20:21.577 --> 20:24.778
Because you wanted
to see me alone.

20:28.617 --> 20:30.551
You're crazy.

20:30.585 --> 20:34.819
Olek, it's okay.

20:35.687 --> 20:37.353
It is.

20:37.387 --> 20:40.269
I know you love me.

20:43.098 --> 20:45.294
I would have
been good to you.

20:53.677 --> 20:55.506
I should kill you
right here.

20:55.540 --> 20:57.769
Kill me.

20:57.803 --> 21:00.266
Help me.

21:05.857 --> 21:07.919
I can't.

21:11.048 --> 21:13.010
You should run.

21:16.337 --> 21:18.900
I've been running
my whole life.

21:18.934 --> 21:21.561
You should run now.

21:39.234 --> 21:41.196
You don't belong here.

21:42.359 --> 21:43.890
How is he?

21:43.925 --> 21:47.384
This is a sacred ritual.
It's not for outsiders.

21:49.481 --> 21:51.544
I just want
to say goodbye.

21:53.541 --> 21:55.871
Please?

22:51.879 --> 22:54.740
He was a great man

22:54.774 --> 22:57.004
and a good friend.

22:57.038 --> 22:59.932
I know you will
continue his work.

22:59.966 --> 23:02.393
Goodbye, Mr. Proctor.

23:49.976 --> 23:52.239
Fuck.

23:52.274 --> 23:54.536
You've been training.

23:54.571 --> 23:57.065
You knew you would have
to face me one day.

23:57.099 --> 23:59.729
Sure, make it
all about you.

24:03.656 --> 24:05.452
Your punches are sharp.

24:05.486 --> 24:07.515
You have speed
and your balance is good,

24:07.550 --> 24:09.545
<i>but you're still a woman.</i>

24:09.580 --> 24:14.070
So it's not dangerous,
not really.

24:14.104 --> 24:16.667
It's just cute.

24:19.961 --> 24:22.290
Cute enough for you?

24:31.244 --> 24:33.374
Why can't we talk
at your place?

24:33.409 --> 24:37.985
No, that's--
that's not a good idea.

24:38.020 --> 24:39.387
What, are you married?

24:39.421 --> 24:42.690
No, no.
It's, um...

24:42.725 --> 24:46.729
This is not a good time
to be around me.

24:46.763 --> 24:49.399
It was a good time
when you were fucking me.

24:56.306 --> 24:58.674
You, uh-- you got
enough money?

25:00.344 --> 25:02.345
I'm not a whore.

25:02.379 --> 25:04.447
No, no, no. No.
Hey, hey, hey.

25:39.251 --> 25:41.552
Oh!

26:52.259 --> 26:54.193
What the hell
is wrong with you?

27:04.170 --> 27:05.938
Do you know who I am?

27:05.972 --> 27:07.706
<i>I'm your uncle.</i>

27:07.741 --> 27:10.076
Your mother's my sister
just like Rebecca's yours.

27:10.110 --> 27:13.012
Your mother treats me
like trash, like a stranger.

27:13.046 --> 27:15.181
- Kai!
- Oh, shut up, Miriam.

27:15.215 --> 27:16.949
You haven't spoken
my name in 20 years.

27:16.984 --> 27:18.551
There's no reason
to start now.

27:21.221 --> 27:22.722
You asked me
to speak to her,

27:22.756 --> 27:24.490
and then you shunned her
before I could.

27:24.524 --> 27:25.992
When we spoke,
I did not know

27:26.026 --> 27:27.626
the full extent
of her transgression.

27:27.661 --> 27:29.896
What kind of father turns
his back on his daughter

27:29.930 --> 27:31.731
at the time
she most needs him?

27:31.765 --> 27:35.434
- Our church is very clear--
- Fuck your goddamn church!

27:35.502 --> 27:39.004
Kai.

27:40.406 --> 27:43.108
Suddenly, everyone
remembers my name.

27:43.142 --> 27:44.877
This is not
your business.

27:44.911 --> 27:48.547
- Take the girl back.
- She is not a girl.

27:48.582 --> 27:49.982
She is a woman.

27:50.017 --> 27:51.484
And we did not
reject her.

27:51.518 --> 27:53.853
<i>You should know</i>
<i>as well as anyone</i>

27:53.887 --> 27:56.956
that it was she
who rejected our ways,

27:56.990 --> 27:58.658
just as you did.

28:00.027 --> 28:01.994
Yeah.

28:03.297 --> 28:06.232
And now in the absence
of true contrition,

28:06.267 --> 28:08.668
you'll toss her out
like garbage.

28:08.703 --> 28:11.205
What about your own
contrition?

28:11.239 --> 28:14.308
Who calls you to account
for these inquisitions of yours?

28:21.016 --> 28:24.218
What do you feel
when you see me?

28:24.252 --> 28:26.053
Hmm?

28:26.088 --> 28:27.855
Does it even
hurt you at all?

28:27.889 --> 28:30.958
My son is dead.

28:32.193 --> 28:35.296
And I finished
mourning him years ago.

28:36.832 --> 28:40.468
You are a criminal
and a trespasser.

28:40.502 --> 28:44.405
I insist you leave
our land at once.

28:46.375 --> 28:47.775
Or what?

28:47.810 --> 28:50.745
Hmm?
Or what?

28:50.780 --> 28:52.781
Be careful, Father.

28:52.815 --> 28:55.550
I have swallowed
your insults for years,

28:55.585 --> 28:59.187
but don't mistake
my tolerance for weakness.

28:59.255 --> 29:01.022
You all live here

29:01.057 --> 29:03.491
because I choose
to allow it.

29:03.526 --> 29:07.662
Not God.
It's me, your dead son!

29:07.696 --> 29:09.563
I allow it!

29:09.598 --> 29:12.066
And if I decide I don't
want you here anymore,

29:12.100 --> 29:15.135
there's no God that'll be able
to protect you from me.

29:15.170 --> 29:18.505
I'll show you all what it feels like
to be cast out.

29:41.761 --> 29:43.396
Fuck.

29:56.644 --> 29:59.512
<i>Come on, Anastasia.</i>

29:59.546 --> 30:02.681
You were always
such a stubborn girl.

30:02.716 --> 30:04.350
You can't be finished yet.

30:04.384 --> 30:06.751
Yah!

30:22.334 --> 30:24.902
Sheriff.
I was just coming to see you.

30:26.738 --> 30:29.139
- Listen, I gotta go.
- Sheriff, I was hoping that we could talk.

30:29.174 --> 30:30.499
About what?

30:30.524 --> 30:32.276
My superiors are starting
to take an interest in you.

30:32.277 --> 30:34.278
And I just got official word
that's there's going to be

30:34.312 --> 30:36.379
a formal investigation
into yesterday's shooting.

30:36.414 --> 30:38.548
What, are you
fuckin' kidding me?

30:38.583 --> 30:40.383
They were career criminals.

30:40.418 --> 30:41.952
They're murderers.

30:41.986 --> 30:44.687
That's what you get for making
news during an election year.

30:44.722 --> 30:46.489
Politicians, they love
their hearings.

30:46.524 --> 30:48.191
But me-- I'm like you.

30:48.259 --> 30:50.494
- See, I like results.
- I really do have to go.

30:50.528 --> 30:51.995
I thought we might
combine our resources

30:52.029 --> 30:53.496
and try to figure out
what happened

30:53.531 --> 30:54.997
to that evidence
against Proctor,

30:55.032 --> 30:56.899
how it found its way
out of a locked room,

30:56.934 --> 30:59.368
- because that was a tough--
- Okay, listen.

30:59.403 --> 31:02.337
call Alma,
set something up, okay?

31:02.372 --> 31:05.541
- I can't do this right now.
- No, we're gonna talk right now.

31:05.575 --> 31:07.776
I'm starting
to wonder about you.

31:07.810 --> 31:10.512
Look, I keep coming up
against these walls everywhere I go,

31:10.546 --> 31:12.047
but I can feel them
starting to crumble.

31:12.081 --> 31:14.649
Something tells me
it's gonna be worth it

31:14.684 --> 31:18.554
to stick around and watch them all
come tumbling down.

31:30.801 --> 31:32.436
Nola.

31:35.640 --> 31:38.075
Hi, Mom.

31:41.179 --> 31:42.846
When did you
get back?

31:42.881 --> 31:45.082
Just now.

31:45.116 --> 31:47.351
There's still time.
You should go to him.

31:48.419 --> 31:51.554
I didn't come here
for him, brother.

31:53.157 --> 31:55.125
Well, he'd be glad
to know you're here.

31:55.159 --> 31:58.228
Which is why
I'm not gonna stay.

31:59.563 --> 32:01.864
I'll be crashing
at your place.

32:05.434 --> 32:07.502
Let me know
when he's dead.

32:52.981 --> 32:54.981
You look just like her.

32:55.016 --> 32:57.751
- What?
- <i>Your mother.</i>

33:00.321 --> 33:02.756
You have her face.

33:03.591 --> 33:05.559
<i>Almost exactly.</i>

33:05.593 --> 33:08.862
I was only a boy
when she died,

33:08.897 --> 33:11.165
but I remember her
very well.

33:11.199 --> 33:13.200
She was
a beautiful woman.

33:13.234 --> 33:16.336
So sad you never
got to meet her.

33:16.371 --> 33:19.106
He never got over
her death.

33:19.140 --> 33:21.442
When a woman dies
in childbirth--

33:21.476 --> 33:24.478
It wasn't my fault.

33:24.513 --> 33:27.415
You were all he had left.

33:28.850 --> 33:31.552
But you were also
the thing that killed her.

33:33.522 --> 33:35.189
Maybe he made mistakes,

33:35.223 --> 33:39.693
but everything he did,
he did out of love.

33:41.396 --> 33:43.998
- It breaks my heart to hit you.
- Then stop.

33:44.032 --> 33:46.200
I can't do it
anymore.

33:46.235 --> 33:49.804
Olek, he's gonna
kill me.

33:49.838 --> 33:52.407
- He's gonna kill me.
- No.

33:52.441 --> 33:56.678
He will kill you
and your family.

34:32.016 --> 34:34.018
You betrayed
your family.

34:34.052 --> 34:36.687
You don't deserve
to have another one.

34:41.393 --> 34:43.960
You're right--

34:43.995 --> 34:45.696
I did love you.

34:45.730 --> 34:47.764
Ah!

34:47.799 --> 34:51.369
But there are things
in life bigger than love.

34:51.402 --> 34:54.072
Ah!

34:57.410 --> 35:00.546
You fight with passion.

35:00.580 --> 35:03.182
Your father would have
been proud to see it.

35:03.216 --> 35:06.485
Don't worry,
I will tell him all about it.

35:07.988 --> 35:10.790
- Yah!
- Ah!

35:35.617 --> 35:37.084
<i>Daddy.</i>

35:37.118 --> 35:39.053
Hey.

35:40.822 --> 35:44.091
Hey, I thought that you and Max
were over at the Frears' pool.

35:44.126 --> 35:46.360
Yeah, I got bored.

35:46.395 --> 35:49.164
Max is fine.
He's playing with Sammy.

35:52.301 --> 35:54.068
Dad, what is going on?

35:54.103 --> 35:56.404
Well, that--

35:56.439 --> 35:58.907
that's not an easy
question to answer.

35:58.941 --> 36:01.677
Did you and Mom
have a fight?

36:01.711 --> 36:04.113
No, no, no, baby.

36:04.147 --> 36:07.516
No, no,
it's not like that.

36:07.551 --> 36:09.652
Jesus,
you're smoking pot?

36:09.686 --> 36:11.821
Yes, I am.

36:23.066 --> 36:26.301
You know, sometimes when the pain
in my shoulder gets bad,

36:26.336 --> 36:30.838
the only thing that works
is a little bit of really good weed.

36:33.042 --> 36:35.577
It's not something
that would help me get reelected,

36:35.611 --> 36:37.178
so I'm very careful
about it.

36:37.213 --> 36:40.314
Your Iraq wound?

36:40.349 --> 36:42.483
Yeah.

36:50.626 --> 36:52.426
Hey.

36:53.862 --> 36:56.463
Here's the thing--

36:58.366 --> 37:01.202
I don't want you
to lie to me...

37:03.438 --> 37:07.542
but I'm not really dying
for you to tell me the truth either.

37:10.980 --> 37:12.648
Just--

37:14.251 --> 37:18.421
just promise me that everything's
gonna be all right.

37:18.455 --> 37:20.456
Shh, shh, shh.

37:26.463 --> 37:29.565
Everything's gonna
be all right.

37:41.879 --> 37:44.113
<i>Mm.</i>

37:44.148 --> 37:46.883
Hey!

37:50.788 --> 37:53.123
Mwah!

37:57.461 --> 37:59.261
<i>What does that mean?</i>

37:59.296 --> 38:01.630
- It means "With God's help..."
- Mm-hmm.

38:01.665 --> 38:03.599
"...we will drink
together again."

38:03.633 --> 38:06.735
When will you learn
to speak Ukrainian? Eh?

38:06.770 --> 38:08.250
I'll speak Ukrainian
when you can sing

38:08.271 --> 38:09.551
the "Star-Spangled
Banner," okay?

38:09.573 --> 38:11.807
- Ooh.
- Eh, I can sing the "Star-Spangled Banner."

38:11.841 --> 38:13.709
- Listen to this. Okay, listen to this.
- Do it, do it.

38:13.744 --> 38:17.012
♪ Oh, beautiful America ♪

38:17.047 --> 38:20.549
<i>♪ God bless thee,</i>
<i>America... ♪</i>

38:20.584 --> 38:22.651
- The song "God Bless America."
- No, that's fuckin', um--

38:22.686 --> 38:24.486
that's like
"America the Beautiful."

38:24.521 --> 38:27.456
- You're not even trying to speak Ukrainian.
- <i>Listen. ♪ America... ♪</i>

38:27.490 --> 38:29.191
A toast.

38:29.225 --> 38:31.794
- Budmo.
- Hey.

38:32.696 --> 38:34.397
- Budmo.
- Hey!

38:34.431 --> 38:37.600
- Budmo!
- <i>Heeey!</i>

38:39.869 --> 38:43.539
Heeey!

38:43.573 --> 38:45.374
What does budmo
mean anyway?

38:45.408 --> 38:47.276
It means...

38:51.448 --> 38:53.549
"We shall live forever."

38:53.583 --> 38:55.284
I'll drink to that.

39:36.559 --> 39:38.693
Get out.

39:38.727 --> 39:40.227
Get dressed and get
the hell out of my house.

39:40.261 --> 39:42.429
- Why are you doing this? What's wrong?
- Get out.

39:42.464 --> 39:45.166
- Get the fuck out of my house.
- Stop it. You're hurting me!

39:45.200 --> 39:47.868
I'm hurting you?
You fuckin' whore.

39:47.902 --> 39:50.071
- I opened my house to you. I took you in.
- No.

39:50.105 --> 39:52.239
Why are you doing this?

39:52.274 --> 39:53.807
You're not here two hours

39:53.832 --> 39:55.667
and you're already out there
fucking someone.

39:56.077 --> 39:57.578
That's not
what happened.

39:57.612 --> 40:00.014
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not lying.

40:00.048 --> 40:03.050
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not lying!

40:49.266 --> 40:51.434
Uncle Kai, wait.
Please.

41:01.379 --> 41:03.881
I'm sorry.

41:03.916 --> 41:07.051
I lost my home today.

41:08.454 --> 41:11.189
I miss my family.

41:11.223 --> 41:15.193
I know I don't belong there anymore,
but still...

41:17.029 --> 41:20.198
I don't know where
I belong anymore.

41:22.335 --> 41:24.937
I know you know
how that felt.

41:28.275 --> 41:30.275
I do.

41:30.310 --> 41:34.212
And there's a part of you
that will never stop feeling like that.

41:38.351 --> 41:40.618
The sheriff--

41:40.653 --> 41:42.487
you can have nothing
to do with him.

41:42.521 --> 41:45.656
He's no one to me.

41:49.160 --> 41:51.328
I'm so sorry.

41:53.265 --> 41:57.068
I just-- I've never been
on my own before.

42:02.241 --> 42:04.008
You're not on your own.

42:27.666 --> 42:29.367
Hello, Anastasia.

42:29.401 --> 42:31.235
I've missed you.

42:34.572 --> 42:36.840
Leave me alone.

42:36.875 --> 42:38.876
You are alone.

42:38.910 --> 42:43.881
You have been alone
ever since you betrayed me.

42:45.450 --> 42:49.286
And now you have betrayed
your husband, your children.

42:49.321 --> 42:52.790
<i>Tell me, is there anyone in your life</i>
<i>you have not betrayed?</i>

42:52.824 --> 42:55.393
No, that's not true.
That's not...

42:55.427 --> 42:59.497
My sweet, lost daughter.

42:59.531 --> 43:01.499
You have been lying
for so long,

43:01.533 --> 43:05.035
you have no idea
what truth is anymore.

43:05.070 --> 43:09.039
<i>You've always been</i>
<i>such a stubborn child,</i>

43:09.074 --> 43:11.875
so certain you knew best.

43:11.910 --> 43:13.944
Yes?

43:14.011 --> 43:16.212
<i>And look at you now--</i>

43:16.246 --> 43:19.315
broken, bleeding, finished.

43:19.350 --> 43:21.217
No.

43:21.252 --> 43:23.120
<i>Even now you fight</i>

43:23.154 --> 43:27.358
<i>when the fight</i>
<i>is already lost.</i>

43:27.392 --> 43:31.262
My poor,
broken Anastasia.

43:32.431 --> 43:34.632
My name is Carrie.

43:34.666 --> 43:35.633
No!

44:05.764 --> 44:08.065
Olek.

44:12.036 --> 44:15.238
Ana.

44:16.974 --> 44:19.642
Budmo.

44:21.745 --> 44:24.881
Hey.

44:27.251 --> 44:29.852
Budmo.

44:29.887 --> 44:33.689
Hey.

44:35.591 --> 44:37.792
Budmo.

45:42.557 --> 45:44.859
Come on, Ana, pick up.

45:46.228 --> 45:49.164
God damn it.

45:57.907 --> 46:00.275
Ana!

46:03.513 --> 46:05.681
Ana.

46:05.716 --> 46:07.650
Ana.
Ana, baby.

46:07.684 --> 46:09.151
Open your eyes.

46:09.185 --> 46:10.686
No, no, no, no.

46:10.720 --> 46:13.121
Baby. Come on.
Come on.

46:13.156 --> 46:16.691
Fuck. Jesus.
Ana, open your eyes.

46:16.726 --> 46:20.395
Ana. Oh, Jesus Christ,
don't you fuckin' do this to me.

46:20.430 --> 46:23.932
No. You come back
to me now.

46:23.967 --> 46:25.367
You come back.

46:25.401 --> 46:27.903
Ana. Open your eyes.
Come on.

46:32.175 --> 46:34.277
Yes.

46:36.147 --> 46:38.582
Ana, Ana.

46:38.616 --> 46:41.451
- Ana.
- It's Carrie.

46:47.424 --> 46:49.225
You're okay.
You're okay.

46:49.259 --> 46:51.427
Come on.
Come on.

46:51.495 --> 46:54.163
Oh, Jesus.

46:59.970 --> 47:02.038
Okay, okay.

47:27.733 --> 47:29.900
<i>Just hold on, baby.</i>

47:34.473 --> 47:37.041
<i>We shall live forever.</i>
