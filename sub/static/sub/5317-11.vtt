WEBVTT

00:25.705 --> 00:27.273
Okay.

00:31.277 --> 00:33.346
Shh!

00:33.379 --> 00:34.780
Okay.

00:34.814 --> 00:36.216
Bye.

00:36.249 --> 00:38.218
I'll see you later.

00:39.051 --> 00:40.186
Ugh!

00:40.220 --> 00:41.687
Can you get rid of that?

00:41.721 --> 00:43.589
Guns freak me out.

00:43.623 --> 00:45.291
950 grams.

00:45.325 --> 00:48.128
They say the human soul
weighs 21 grams.

00:48.161 --> 00:49.662
Never mind. I'll do it.

00:51.097 --> 00:52.898
Hey, that's your best
garbage bag.

00:52.932 --> 00:54.134
You going somewhere?

00:54.167 --> 00:55.711
I'm just staying
at Lindsay's for a bit.

00:55.735 --> 00:57.370
She needs help with everything.

00:57.403 --> 00:58.504
See ya.

01:27.300 --> 01:28.401
Killer hook, Linds.

01:28.434 --> 01:29.435
Thanks.

01:29.469 --> 01:30.903
And guess what.

01:30.936 --> 01:32.080
We're going to Fire 103 today

01:32.104 --> 01:33.406
to drop the song

01:33.439 --> 01:35.475
on Trace's show. Nice!

01:35.508 --> 01:38.678
Well, I better get back to it.

01:38.711 --> 01:41.113
Oh, creating a human life.

01:41.147 --> 01:44.150
I got to tell you,
it is so fulfilling.

01:44.184 --> 01:46.186
But making a grammatical
nightmare of a song

01:46.219 --> 01:47.787
with Gretchen's
psychopath client,

01:47.820 --> 01:50.456
that's a really big deal,
you know, for you.

01:50.490 --> 01:52.258
Oh, hey.

01:52.292 --> 01:53.759
Tomorrow I'm eating runny cheese

01:53.793 --> 01:55.828
and going on
an inverted roller coaster.

01:55.861 --> 01:57.430
Want to come? Okay.

01:57.463 --> 01:59.332
Oh, sorry, I forgot.

01:59.365 --> 02:02.034
You can't ever do anything fun
because you're ruining your body

02:02.067 --> 02:03.869
with some
ginger-headed parasite.

02:03.903 --> 02:05.605
Ha! Whatever.

02:05.638 --> 02:08.674
In five months, I will be on
a Disney cruise with my family

02:08.708 --> 02:10.342
while you're at divorce court,

02:10.376 --> 02:12.712
looking back on the time
someone took pity on you

02:12.745 --> 02:15.014
and let you sing
on their stupid song.

02:16.382 --> 02:19.952
"New Phone Who 'Dis?"
is not a stupid song.

02:19.985 --> 02:22.021
It's about texting!

02:29.161 --> 02:30.563
"K"?

02:30.596 --> 02:32.698
Wow.

02:32.732 --> 02:34.166
You weren't lying.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.835
Was that 2010?

02:35.868 --> 02:38.170
Giant slalom.

02:38.204 --> 02:39.639
So what happened?

02:39.672 --> 02:41.974
Well, here was me
a couple of months later

02:42.007 --> 02:44.544
at the Winter X Games,
out of my gourd

02:44.577 --> 02:46.655
on a couple of bong loads of
Shaun White's sour diesel.

02:46.679 --> 02:48.147
Ah.

02:48.180 --> 02:50.516
Well, you are skiing
the general idea of the course.

02:50.550 --> 02:52.852
You're pole adjacent. Christ!

02:52.885 --> 02:54.220
Oh, God!

02:54.254 --> 02:55.421
Oh, that is... Oh, no!

02:55.455 --> 02:57.223
I broke my leg
in a dozen places.

02:57.257 --> 02:59.225
If you listen close,
you can hear Brent Musburger

02:59.259 --> 03:00.360
gag back a puke.

03:00.393 --> 03:03.028
So I hung it up,

03:03.062 --> 03:04.096
and then my grandpa died,

03:04.129 --> 03:05.831
and I took over his bar.

03:05.865 --> 03:07.066
Life is long.

03:07.099 --> 03:09.735
That it is, my gimpy friend.

03:11.871 --> 03:13.606
So, skiers.

03:13.639 --> 03:15.675
You guys must have large feet

03:15.708 --> 03:18.444
in order
to balance properly, right?

03:22.081 --> 03:24.917
My, what big, silly feet
you have.

03:26.085 --> 03:27.853
Fitting boots to those
would give

03:27.887 --> 03:29.355
Giles Kevinson a heart attack.

03:29.389 --> 03:31.056
Oh, a Buckle Your Shoes
deep cut.

03:31.090 --> 03:32.858
I'm so mad

03:32.892 --> 03:35.271
that we never got a happy ending
between Heathstead and Beatrix.

03:35.295 --> 03:36.472
You've not seen
the holiday special?

03:36.496 --> 03:38.063
There's a holiday special?

03:38.097 --> 03:39.565
Yes, I own a copy.

03:39.599 --> 03:40.642
What happens? Do they kiss?

03:40.666 --> 03:42.302
Well... Don't say anything.

03:42.335 --> 03:43.736
Go get it.
I have to watch it now.

03:43.769 --> 03:46.272
I doubt you have
an all-region DVD player.

03:46.306 --> 03:47.807
I don't even know what that is!

03:47.840 --> 03:48.908
Can I come over

03:48.941 --> 03:50.643
and watch?

03:50.676 --> 03:52.445
Come on, come on.

03:52.478 --> 03:54.146
Come on. Okay.

03:54.179 --> 03:55.915
Give me a second.

03:55.948 --> 03:57.583
Come on, come on.

03:57.617 --> 03:58.584
Come on, come on,

03:58.618 --> 04:00.219
come on, come on, come on.

04:00.252 --> 04:02.822
Come on! Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on,

04:02.855 --> 04:05.157
come on, come on.

04:05.190 --> 04:06.392
Come on, come on, come on.

04:06.426 --> 04:07.327
Okay, let's go.

04:24.944 --> 04:26.446
Okay, that was, uh,

04:26.479 --> 04:29.782
"New Phone Who 'Dis?"

04:29.815 --> 04:33.085
The first solo single
by my man Sam Dresden.

04:33.118 --> 04:34.454
Caller, you're on Fire 103.

04:34.487 --> 04:35.855
Tell me what you think.

04:36.522 --> 04:37.289
Wack.

04:37.323 --> 04:38.358
Hmm.

04:38.391 --> 04:39.468
Thoughts on Dresden's new song?

04:39.492 --> 04:41.260
Wack as hell.

04:41.293 --> 04:42.428
You're on with Trace. Go.

04:42.462 --> 04:43.696
A step back creatively.

04:43.729 --> 04:45.297
Without his
former collaborators,

04:45.331 --> 04:46.666
Dresden leans
on typewriter drums

04:46.699 --> 04:48.868
and almost unmotivated
tempo shifts.

04:48.901 --> 04:51.471
Not helped
by the thin female vocals.

04:51.504 --> 04:52.872
He said I sounded thin!

04:52.905 --> 04:55.140
Man, my tempo shifts
are unmotivated on purpose!

04:55.174 --> 04:57.176
Gretchen Cutler,

04:57.209 --> 04:58.444
Caliber Publicity.

04:58.478 --> 04:59.979
I think it's important
to consider

05:00.012 --> 05:01.523
side projects separate
from the main artists.

05:01.547 --> 05:04.016
Uh, Temple of the Dog,
Chris Gaines.

05:04.049 --> 05:05.985
These are really old references.

05:06.018 --> 05:08.421
I'll look stuff up.
Anyway, context!

05:10.022 --> 05:12.825
I went to commercial
as soon as you started talking,

05:12.858 --> 05:14.193
and your client bailed
on my show.

05:14.226 --> 05:15.395
Shit.

05:20.165 --> 05:23.803
Could you transfer some funds
from the account ending in 3278?

05:23.836 --> 05:25.371
I'm sorry, sir.

05:25.405 --> 05:27.840
That checking account
is overdrawn.

05:27.873 --> 05:28.708
Hey, babe!

05:28.741 --> 05:30.643
I can have one.

05:30.676 --> 05:32.244
I'm celebrating.

05:32.277 --> 05:34.747
Lindsay's song totally tanked
on the radio.

05:34.780 --> 05:37.417
I need you to get me some food.

05:37.450 --> 05:39.218
Write this down.

05:39.752 --> 05:41.421
Two...

05:41.454 --> 05:43.255
Two beef and cheddars
from Arby's,

05:43.288 --> 05:45.357
a birthday cake, Red Vines,

05:45.391 --> 05:47.593
Skinnylicious Salmon Rolls
from Cheesecake Factory,

05:47.627 --> 05:49.929
a large popcorn from AMC...
Just buy the ticket and leave.

05:49.962 --> 05:52.231
Oh, man, I don't have any cash.

05:52.264 --> 05:54.175
You never have cash lately.
Just put it on the card.

05:54.199 --> 05:56.068
We need the points
for the cruise anyway.

05:56.101 --> 05:57.503
Oh, yeah, doy.

05:57.537 --> 05:59.217
Thanks for the food, Daddy!

06:14.319 --> 06:15.521
Sam!

06:15.555 --> 06:16.698
Why would you let me
do that show?

06:16.722 --> 06:18.190
Because you wanted to.

06:18.223 --> 06:21.694
You said, and I quote,
"Get your negligent ass

06:21.727 --> 06:23.596
down to Fire 103.
We doin' a show."

06:23.629 --> 06:25.030
My blood sugar was low!

06:25.064 --> 06:26.575
You're supposed to give me
some goddamn almonds!

06:26.599 --> 06:29.101
I am doing the best I can, Sam!

06:29.134 --> 06:31.704
Then do someone else's best,
like Hillary Clinton

06:31.737 --> 06:33.473
or Tori Amos circa
Little Earthquakes.

06:33.506 --> 06:35.741
What are you on right now,
honestly?

06:35.775 --> 06:37.977
And don't lie to me. Adderall.

06:38.010 --> 06:39.612
And it's not even
working anymore.

06:39.645 --> 06:43.082
This entire feud is your fault,
and those dis tracks

06:43.115 --> 06:44.884
contain some shit that,
quite frankly,

06:44.917 --> 06:47.119
I'm having some problems
recovering from.

06:47.152 --> 06:49.455
Honey Nutz and Shitstain
literally haven't said anything

06:49.489 --> 06:50.756
about you that isn't true.

06:50.790 --> 06:52.492
They said your
grandma's a whore,

06:52.525 --> 06:54.503
you don't have the head shape
for a five-panel hat,

06:54.527 --> 06:56.496
your built-ins aren't original,

06:56.529 --> 06:58.230
you're not licensed
to teach Meisner...

06:58.263 --> 06:59.732
Hold up, hold up!

06:59.765 --> 07:02.367
They said my built-ins
aren't original?

07:03.268 --> 07:05.104
How did they know? I...

07:05.137 --> 07:06.572
Listen, they nailed shit
back then

07:06.606 --> 07:07.940
instead of using dowels,
Gretchen.

07:07.973 --> 07:09.074
There were no dowels!

07:09.108 --> 07:11.511
There were no dowels!

07:11.544 --> 07:12.512
Never!

07:12.545 --> 07:13.979
There were no dowels!

07:20.019 --> 07:23.689
Hey, you're still coming to my
improv grad performance, right?

07:23.723 --> 07:26.125
Oh, how could I squander
the opportunity

07:26.158 --> 07:30.262
to see the gifted thespians
of the Wednesday 3:00 p.m. show?

07:30.295 --> 07:32.765
So I'm going
to a barbecue tomorrow

07:32.798 --> 07:35.000
with Dorothy's old team.

07:35.034 --> 07:36.802
I'm a little nervous.

07:36.836 --> 07:41.841
Just mimic everything they do
like a rapidly mutating virus.

07:41.874 --> 07:43.543
I think I'm just gonna
be myself.

07:43.576 --> 07:46.011
That's the worst version of you.

07:47.813 --> 07:51.016
So, Gretchen told me
she's staying at Lindsay's.

07:52.317 --> 07:53.352
Something going on?

07:53.385 --> 07:55.187
We're fine. Go away.

08:00.693 --> 08:02.562
Go, go, go.

08:08.267 --> 08:11.203
Here's the last of the wellies.

08:11.236 --> 08:12.572
Oh, look.

08:12.605 --> 08:14.506
It's starting to snow.

08:16.075 --> 08:18.210
Is this it?

08:23.182 --> 08:26.552
Beatrix, can I
fetch you a pair of wellies?

08:26.586 --> 08:28.087
Oh, my God.

08:28.120 --> 08:31.724
Oh, Heathstead, I'm not here
for bleeding boots.

08:32.558 --> 08:34.092
Well, Beatrix,

08:34.126 --> 08:37.597
it's been a right pleasure

08:37.630 --> 08:39.431
buckling your shoes.

08:39.464 --> 08:41.601
What are you doing?!

08:51.210 --> 08:52.845
I forgot one thing.

08:52.878 --> 08:54.980
Do it. Do it!

08:56.916 --> 08:58.618
They're kissing!

08:58.651 --> 09:00.052
Jimmy, they're kissing!

09:00.085 --> 09:01.687
Oh, my God!

09:01.721 --> 09:03.088
Oh, finally.

09:03.122 --> 09:04.590
Okay!

09:04.624 --> 09:06.759
Look, the truth is,

09:06.792 --> 09:09.228
I have a girlfriend.

09:09.261 --> 09:10.696
Who?

09:10.730 --> 09:12.765
Greasy-hair Queen of Dragons?

09:12.798 --> 09:13.966
Yeah.

09:13.999 --> 09:15.300
Oh, Jesus.

09:16.468 --> 09:18.237
So, I'm gonna go.

09:18.270 --> 09:21.440
And I'm gonna take this DVD

09:21.473 --> 09:24.644
and this DVD player
and this HDMI cord.

09:41.260 --> 09:43.295
I don't know how
I let it go so far,

09:43.328 --> 09:46.732
but I am in big trouble, Paul,
with a girl from the Internet.

09:46.766 --> 09:48.868
What girl?

09:50.135 --> 09:52.838
Fun! Great shot, nerd!

09:54.874 --> 09:56.108
I'm a money slave.

09:56.141 --> 09:58.143
A money what? A money slave.

09:58.177 --> 10:00.155
I let a girl from the Internet
control my finances.

10:00.179 --> 10:02.447
It's like S and M,
but instead of physical pain,

10:02.481 --> 10:03.683
it's financial pain.

10:05.184 --> 10:07.853
Little pig boy,
pay for my Invisalign.

10:08.688 --> 10:10.155
Send money, loser!

10:10.189 --> 10:12.424
That's my goddess, Kasia.

10:12.457 --> 10:14.994
In the last four months,
I've given her, like, a hundo.

10:15.027 --> 10:17.229
$100,000?!

10:18.063 --> 10:19.699
Ha!

10:19.732 --> 10:21.500
Nice fart, Paul!

10:21.533 --> 10:22.968
Real poopy!

10:25.838 --> 10:27.873
I'm ending it.
Kasia's gone rogue.

10:27.907 --> 10:30.943
If I don't give her $15K,
she's gonna tell Becca.

10:30.976 --> 10:34.013
You got to help me.
We're family.

10:34.046 --> 10:36.481
Okay. Of course, Vernon.

10:36.515 --> 10:37.349
Oh, geez.

10:37.382 --> 10:39.018
Thanks, Paul.

10:41.754 --> 10:43.488
When I was 12,

10:43.522 --> 10:46.158
me and my buddy, Slider,
jacked off next to each other

10:46.191 --> 10:47.192
on a camping trip.

10:47.226 --> 10:48.961
Why are you telling me that?

10:48.994 --> 10:50.696
Nothing.

10:50.730 --> 10:52.431
Just memories.

11:04.443 --> 11:05.477
You're here!

11:05.510 --> 11:06.654
Hey, guys, you remember Edgar.

11:06.678 --> 11:07.913
Hey.

11:07.947 --> 11:09.314
Hey, man. Hey. Uh, hi.

11:09.348 --> 11:11.416
I, uh, I brought this.

11:11.450 --> 11:13.753
Oh, wine, thanks.

11:17.589 --> 11:18.724
Oh, damn it, my back!

11:18.758 --> 11:19.658
Are you okay?

11:19.691 --> 11:20.760
Oh, yeah, it just hurts

11:20.793 --> 11:22.061
'cause my dick's so big.

11:23.462 --> 11:25.230
Nah, he's always showing
us his tiny dick,

11:25.264 --> 11:27.566
and the bit is he pretends
like it's all big.

11:27.599 --> 11:29.234
So your back doesn't hurt?

11:29.268 --> 11:30.602
No, actually it does.

11:30.635 --> 11:31.913
Last week, my neighbor's
pit bull attacked me

11:31.937 --> 11:33.105
when I was carrying a pizza.

11:34.740 --> 11:36.408
That actually wasn't a bit.

11:36.441 --> 11:38.720
Yeah, it's really bad... I have
to sleep in a water brace.

11:38.744 --> 11:40.345
Probably end up in a wheelchair.

11:40.379 --> 11:41.881
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

11:41.914 --> 11:43.282
I'm just kidding, man.

11:43.315 --> 11:45.484
That was a bit.

11:47.386 --> 11:49.254
Oh, there's the team
that I coached...

11:49.288 --> 11:51.223
"Beverley Hills
with an Extra E."

11:51.256 --> 11:52.958
I should probably go say hi.

11:52.992 --> 11:54.193
You good?

11:54.226 --> 11:56.395
Oh, y-yeah, yeah, totally.

11:58.563 --> 11:59.464
Oh, hey.

11:59.498 --> 12:00.699
You know Edgar?

12:00.732 --> 12:01.910
He's the one putting
it in Dorothy

12:01.934 --> 12:03.402
and taking it back out again.

12:03.435 --> 12:05.905
Nah.
I usually just leave it in.

12:05.938 --> 12:07.940
Uh... So, anyway,

12:07.973 --> 12:09.951
I'm putting this packet together
for the new Hee Haw reboot.

12:09.975 --> 12:11.110
Man, that...

12:15.414 --> 12:17.249
Goddamn it!

12:17.282 --> 12:18.483
What?!

12:18.517 --> 12:20.352
Hello.

12:23.022 --> 12:25.724
Red licorice vodka?

12:25.757 --> 12:27.259
Were you expecting Chris Hansen?

12:27.292 --> 12:29.294
Why are you here?

12:29.328 --> 12:32.164
Last night, a certifiable
fox hit on me,

12:32.197 --> 12:33.632
and I did not respond.

12:33.665 --> 12:35.734
I masturbated furiously
afterwards,

12:35.767 --> 12:37.970
but only after I'd rejected her.

12:38.003 --> 12:39.638
You need to stop.

12:39.671 --> 12:41.140
It's like you have amnesia.

12:41.173 --> 12:43.575
Every day, you think
things are gonna be different,

12:43.608 --> 12:45.077
and I'll just be happy.

12:45.110 --> 12:47.512
Well, maybe you can

12:47.546 --> 12:50.015
understand this.

12:50.049 --> 12:52.751
I feel nothing.

12:52.784 --> 12:55.287
About anything.

12:55.320 --> 12:58.023
Dogs, candy,
old Blondie records,

12:58.057 --> 13:00.125
nachos, you, us... nothing.

13:01.626 --> 13:05.064
So for the last time, please go!

13:15.574 --> 13:17.076
Ugh.

13:29.221 --> 13:31.223
You're listening
to Clockin' Out with Trace

13:31.256 --> 13:32.791
on Fire 103.

13:32.824 --> 13:34.159
Yeah, welcome back now.

13:34.193 --> 13:37.029
Everybody's been
talking about what happened

13:37.062 --> 13:38.730
on yesterday's show.

13:38.763 --> 13:40.808
So when Sam called up, looking
to apologize, I was like,

13:40.832 --> 13:45.304
"You need to come down here,
man-to-man, face-to-Trace."

13:45.337 --> 13:47.339
I wasn't trying
to be disrespectful

13:47.372 --> 13:49.208
by walking out yesterday.

13:49.241 --> 13:50.342
Hold up, hold up.

13:50.375 --> 13:51.977
I got a surprise for you.

13:52.011 --> 13:56.015
In the building...
S-stain and Honey Nutz!

13:56.048 --> 13:58.250
Live on Fire 103, 'cause
we keeps it real here.

13:58.283 --> 14:00.419
Gentlemen.

14:01.686 --> 14:03.855
So, Sam,

14:03.889 --> 14:06.758
you had something to say?

14:06.791 --> 14:09.028
I feel bad for walking
out yesterday.

14:09.061 --> 14:11.763
But I'm happy that I'm here now,

14:11.796 --> 14:13.665
so I can tell you...

14:13.698 --> 14:16.235
what nasty mother
y'all are!

14:16.268 --> 14:17.702
you, Shitstain!

14:17.736 --> 14:20.739
you, Honey Nutz!

14:20.772 --> 14:22.674
And you, Trace! Ouch.

14:22.707 --> 14:25.227
Almonds, Sam, almonds, almonds.
I don't want no goddamn almonds.

14:26.045 --> 14:28.347
Well, caller,
you on with Trace. Go.

14:28.380 --> 14:31.951
I mean, Sam,
you coming off like a bitch.

14:31.984 --> 14:33.953
Who you calling a bitch?

14:33.986 --> 14:35.220
I will kill you!

14:35.254 --> 14:36.621
Come down to the station.

14:36.655 --> 14:38.590
Fine. What's the address?

14:38.623 --> 14:40.592
Oh, you don't have Google?

14:40.625 --> 14:42.561
Look it up, you poor-as-shit,

14:42.594 --> 14:46.131
no-search-engine-having
hand-job prostitute!

14:46.165 --> 14:48.767
I am a one in a generation.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.602
A disrupter.

14:50.635 --> 14:52.813
You know how in that Charlie
Chaplin movie, there's this ho

14:52.837 --> 14:54.273
walking and talking
on a cell phone

14:54.306 --> 14:56.708
even though it's 1928?

14:56.741 --> 14:58.543
I'm that future-ass
cell phone ho!

14:58.577 --> 15:00.479
Trace,

15:00.512 --> 15:02.314
I'm out here every day,

15:02.347 --> 15:04.749
changing the face
of everything...

15:04.783 --> 15:07.319
Music, art,

15:07.352 --> 15:09.088
amusement parks,

15:09.121 --> 15:11.790
farm-to-table, claymation,

15:11.823 --> 15:13.258
laser shows...

15:13.292 --> 15:16.128
Oh, whoa, careful, man,
that's medicinal.

15:17.596 --> 15:19.798
They call me Dr. Weed.

15:20.832 --> 15:23.902
They call me Dr. Weed...!

15:23.935 --> 15:26.005
Boy, I'm gonna
get you some water.

15:26.038 --> 15:28.440
They call me Dr. Weed, bitch!

15:32.011 --> 15:33.678
No way Dorothy
doesn't love this.

15:36.015 --> 15:39.451
Hey, come hang out.

15:39.484 --> 15:41.686
Look, I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have gotten so messed up.

15:41.720 --> 15:42.954
It happens. Let's go.

15:42.988 --> 15:44.589
I'm so over this party.
I'm sorry.

15:44.623 --> 15:47.026
I apologize.

15:47.059 --> 15:50.529
From the bottom of my...

15:51.696 --> 15:53.832
Jesus Christ, Edgar,
put those away!

15:53.865 --> 15:57.369
Dr. Weed... is going to live...

15:57.402 --> 15:59.804
forever!

15:59.838 --> 16:02.041
Cannonball!

16:04.309 --> 16:06.211
I only have one thing
to say to you fools,

16:06.245 --> 16:08.647
and it is this: How dare you?!

16:08.680 --> 16:10.115
You stopped coming to sessions.

16:10.149 --> 16:12.284
All of my success is for us.

16:12.317 --> 16:14.886
Because unlike you,
I'm loyal as shit.

16:14.919 --> 16:16.188
Then why didn't you show up

16:16.221 --> 16:17.661
to Jaclyn's dental school
graduation?

16:17.689 --> 16:19.691
I told you, I don't
like hanging out

16:19.724 --> 16:21.193
with those rich USC assholes.

16:21.226 --> 16:23.562
Your dad is a lawyer for CBS.

16:28.933 --> 16:30.335
Which one of y'all is Sam?

16:30.369 --> 16:32.171
Are you that bitch
that called the station?

16:32.837 --> 16:34.206
Oh! Oh, no!

16:34.239 --> 16:35.507
He got that Denzel face.

16:35.540 --> 16:37.376
Size her up, Stain.

16:37.409 --> 16:39.244
Stop it! Get up, Stain!

16:39.278 --> 16:40.812
Stop it! Aah!

16:40.845 --> 16:43.482
You got to fight,
Stain! Get up, Stain!

16:43.515 --> 16:44.583
Stain!

16:44.616 --> 16:46.418
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:47.852 --> 16:49.721
Oh, I'm ready for you now.

16:54.626 --> 16:56.495
"Can't afford a search engine."

16:56.528 --> 16:58.397
Talk about me. I got Google.

16:58.430 --> 16:59.398
Google that.

16:59.431 --> 17:00.499
Song is wack as hell.

17:00.532 --> 17:03.268
Pineapple! Pineapple!

17:06.238 --> 17:08.039
Run. Let's go!

17:17.281 --> 17:18.517
You okay, man?

17:18.550 --> 17:20.352
That was crazy.

17:20.385 --> 17:22.287
That little one was
kind of hot though.

17:23.321 --> 17:25.390
Guys, I'm sorry.

17:25.424 --> 17:27.392
Yeah, me, too, man.

17:27.425 --> 17:29.060
I'm sorry, too.

17:29.094 --> 17:31.263
Take me to my Volt.

17:33.898 --> 17:36.135
That little
one can swing, man.

17:43.775 --> 17:45.577
I mean, who does
Lindsay think she is?

17:45.610 --> 17:47.222
She's not even a trained singer.

17:47.246 --> 17:50.649
I'm the one who was almost
on Kids Incorporated.

17:56.321 --> 17:58.123
Ugh, that bitch.

17:58.157 --> 17:59.458
I know, right?!

17:59.491 --> 18:00.735
Can't even believe
we're sisters sometimes.

18:05.997 --> 18:07.966
Uh, uh, honey?

18:07.999 --> 18:09.000
Honey?

18:09.033 --> 18:11.670
Honey, if you could...?

18:14.273 --> 18:16.375
We're closed.

18:18.843 --> 18:20.479
Why are your lips all red?

18:20.512 --> 18:22.947
Oh, flavored vodka.

18:22.981 --> 18:23.948
Yikes.

18:23.982 --> 18:25.317
You want some coffee?

18:25.350 --> 18:26.985
Nah.

18:27.018 --> 18:28.187
How about some Scotch?

18:32.023 --> 18:34.326
Hey, wait, Dor...

18:34.359 --> 18:36.595
Dorothy, wait!

18:36.628 --> 18:38.963
Hey, I didn't do anything
your friends don't do,

18:38.997 --> 18:41.333
and you spent seven
years with them.

18:41.366 --> 18:43.335
No, I wasted
seven years on them.

18:43.368 --> 18:45.036
I woke up one day
in a rotting Victorian

18:45.069 --> 18:47.005
with three smelly dudes.

18:47.038 --> 18:49.007
And then you came along,
a new person,

18:49.040 --> 18:52.010
who's honest and sweet and rare.

18:52.043 --> 18:54.021
But you know what, maybe
I just make bad decisions.

18:54.045 --> 18:56.215
I mean, I bought a chocolate
fountain... who does that?

18:58.350 --> 19:00.452
I don't want to be
a bad decision.

19:00.485 --> 19:02.887
I'm 33; I need
my life to move forward.

19:02.921 --> 19:05.357
Uh, uh, Jimmy told me
that I shouldn't be...

19:05.390 --> 19:06.725
Okay, I should've known.

19:06.758 --> 19:08.135
Don't ever listen
to Jimmy's advice about me.

19:08.159 --> 19:09.828
Okay.

19:11.062 --> 19:13.232
Do you still like me?

19:13.265 --> 19:15.734
Of course I do.

19:15.767 --> 19:17.902
So much that it sucks.

19:31.350 --> 19:32.851
Oh.

19:35.287 --> 19:37.722
That fight really
scared me, Gretch.

19:37.756 --> 19:40.392
Lying in that trash,

19:40.425 --> 19:44.563
my life flashed before my eyes.

19:44.596 --> 19:46.030
Dick.

19:46.064 --> 19:49.033
Following Smash Mouth
around Europe.

19:49.067 --> 19:51.903
Negative after negative
customer service interaction.

19:51.936 --> 19:54.205
Divorce.

19:54.239 --> 19:55.874
More dick.

19:55.907 --> 19:58.410
I realized I really need
to get my shit together.

20:01.780 --> 20:05.116
Hey, are you okay?

20:05.149 --> 20:09.020
When I pulled a gun on that
girl, coked out of my face,

20:09.053 --> 20:12.591
I suddenly felt
this strange feeling.

20:12.624 --> 20:14.426
I was bored.

20:14.459 --> 20:19.063
You were bored almost getting
murdered by female gang ladies?

20:19.097 --> 20:21.633
That's really messed up,
isn't it?

20:22.834 --> 20:24.303
Yes.

20:27.171 --> 20:30.108
This isn't working anymore.

20:34.646 --> 20:36.981
I'm sorry you don't
feel anything, Gretchen.

20:37.015 --> 20:39.918
Me, too.

20:48.827 --> 20:51.162
Okay.

20:51.195 --> 20:53.965
Right, let's play...

20:53.998 --> 20:55.600
a hypothetical.

20:55.634 --> 20:59.904
All right, so let's say
I was your boyfriend.

20:59.938 --> 21:01.005
Okay.

21:01.039 --> 21:02.474
Could I drink here for free?

21:02.507 --> 21:03.842
Of course.

21:03.875 --> 21:05.344
Could I have my own stool?

21:05.377 --> 21:07.278
Sure.

21:07.312 --> 21:10.114
With a plaque
with my name on it.

21:10.148 --> 21:13.084
Wait, in this fantasy, you
get everything you want?

21:13.117 --> 21:15.019
Uh-huh. Free drinks,
your own stool.

21:15.053 --> 21:15.987
Uh-huh.

21:16.020 --> 21:18.089
What do I get?

21:18.122 --> 21:21.326
Well, you have to ask
for what you want.

21:21.360 --> 21:24.796
Would you dedicate
your book to me?

21:25.697 --> 21:27.098
Absolutely.

21:27.131 --> 21:30.034
Where would your plaque be?

21:30.068 --> 21:31.336
Well, here.

21:31.370 --> 21:33.171
Where?

21:33.204 --> 21:35.173
Here. Look close.

21:35.206 --> 21:37.509
Can you picture it?

21:37.542 --> 21:40.011
It'll be so beautiful.

21:49.053 --> 21:51.155
I should go.

21:51.189 --> 21:53.358
Yeah.

22:03.067 --> 22:04.736
Night, Nina.

22:04.769 --> 22:06.938
Night, Jimmy.

22:16.581 --> 22:18.750
I forgot one thing.

22:59.624 --> 23:01.760
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

23:16.475 --> 23:20.178
You know, if you lowered me
about three feet...

23:31.422 --> 23:34.493
When a thoroughbred is retired,
he's put out to stud.

23:34.526 --> 23:37.095
My only regret is that I cannot
inject my excellence into...

23:37.128 --> 23:38.663
Future generations,

23:38.697 --> 23:41.065
who will know that I
respected and admired...

23:41.099 --> 23:45.136
Boobs. Boobs do not make you
less of a fantasy player.

23:45.169 --> 23:48.673
I dominated these guys.
I stomped all over their...

23:48.707 --> 23:50.942
Sacks. Touchdowns.

23:50.975 --> 23:53.845
Doesn't matter how you score, as
long as you leave everything...

23:53.878 --> 23:55.614
In the toilet.

23:55.647 --> 23:58.349
Every year, my team inevitably
ends up in the crapper.

23:58.382 --> 23:59.951
Sometimes I feel like I...

23:59.984 --> 24:03.121
