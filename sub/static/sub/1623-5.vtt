WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.116
Previously on 12 Monkeys...

00:02.294 --> 00:03.830
- Do you know who we are?
- West 7.

00:06.590 --> 00:09.548
Leland Goines had a secret lab.
His daughter knows where it is.

00:09.676 --> 00:10.665
They want what's inside.

00:10.802 --> 00:13.544
MAN: Jennifer, your father is dead.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.296
JONES: Goines is in the hands
of the Army of the 12 Monkeys.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.515
Monkeys?

00:18.644 --> 00:20.054
Tell me the location of the Night Room.

00:20.187 --> 00:24.100
Their specialized equipment.
You find it, you find the Night Room.

00:26.485 --> 00:29.818
I found it. I found the Night Room.

00:55.806 --> 00:59.424
MAN: Markridge 1, landing team standing
by to receive package in Frost 2.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.551
What's your ETA to destination?

01:01.687 --> 01:03.552
- We're here.
- Copy that.

01:21.957 --> 01:24.118
Frost 2 and package delivered.
We're clear.

01:37.806 --> 01:40.468
Miss Goines, I'm Ivan.

01:41.810 --> 01:45.428
Your father, he speaks...
he speaks very, very highly of you.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.144
I doubt that.

01:50.277 --> 01:53.485
I'm sorry about all the security.
It's part of the new protocol.

01:53.614 --> 01:57.106
We don't know what's out there.
They don't know what's in here. It's...

01:57.242 --> 01:59.733
This... This way.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.887
Welcome to the Night Room.

02:22.017 --> 02:25.805
- Complete with evening stars.
- The Big Burn system?

02:25.937 --> 02:29.065
- Yeah, it's badass.
- It is badass.

02:30.942 --> 02:35.231
And the vault is like its own little
Fort Knox per Dr. Toussaint's specs.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.904
And obviously you're the only one here
who can open it.

02:42.746 --> 02:45.533
So if someone comes looking
for Daddy's little secret,

02:45.666 --> 02:48.282
they have to get though that...
and that and that?

02:48.502 --> 02:50.242
It's secure.

02:55.133 --> 02:57.875
You don't think
someone would try and steal this thing?

02:58.011 --> 02:59.296
It's happened before.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.145
- Failsafe activated.
- Sorry.

03:10.273 --> 03:13.185
- Couple more scary failsafes.
- Enter failsafe password.

03:13.318 --> 03:15.229
There we go.

03:21.410 --> 03:24.197
- This is a bad idea.
- Are you OK?

03:24.329 --> 03:26.945
This thing falls in the wrong hands,

03:27.082 --> 03:30.666
brimstone, horsemen, zombies,
crazy clowns, party's over.

03:30.794 --> 03:34.958
Um... For... For who? For Markridge?

03:35.924 --> 03:37.835
For everyone.

03:42.514 --> 03:46.098
MAN: Truly for the last time,
tell us how to find the Night Room.

04:01.450 --> 04:05.864
- COLE: It's in Westminster, Maryland.
- JONES: LeIand's black budget lab.

04:05.996 --> 04:09.079
Cassie found it
using records from the CDC.

04:09.207 --> 04:12.074
She needs to confirm it.
I'm supposed to meet her there.

04:12.210 --> 04:15.418
On a first-name basis
with Dr. Railly now?

04:15.589 --> 04:17.079
This is the only lab we found

04:17.215 --> 04:20.082
that uses that specific type
of containment system.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.626
It's gotta be
where Leland kept the virus.

04:22.763 --> 04:26.847
- And where you'll destroy it.
- Yep. The beast is ready?

04:26.975 --> 04:31.594
The damage from the West 7 attack
was substantial, but... she'll be ready.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.764
- You should get some rest.
- So should you.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.432
Yeah, I never really sleep
before a jump.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.567
Ramse and I usually knock a couple back.

04:39.696 --> 04:42.563
It's become
a kind of pre-splinter tradition.

04:42.699 --> 04:47.409
Now I know why our calculations are off.
It's the alcohol in your bloodstream.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.573
Hey, Katarina.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.326
- Hey, hey.
- There he is.

04:56.463 --> 04:59.876
- MAX: Oh.
- The last great hope for mankind.

05:01.593 --> 05:02.628
And...

05:02.761 --> 05:06.299
Hope I'm not disturbing
your farewell ceremony.

05:07.432 --> 05:10.640
No. Yeah, have a seat.

05:11.853 --> 05:16.847
- Mr. Cole said you were having a toast.
- Yeah, could be our last night here.

05:16.983 --> 05:22.728
If big boy here doesn't screw up
and he actually changes history.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.692
Best hangover cure ever.

05:26.910 --> 05:32.121
I've been saving this. But as they say,
no time like the present.

05:32.249 --> 05:33.659
- All right.
- To the present.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.999
- RAMSE: Now we're talking.
- JONES: Yeah.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.623
JONES: Boss.

05:39.798 --> 05:42.915
COLE: Did we ever tell you
about Donovan?

05:43.051 --> 05:44.291
JONES: Who?

05:45.136 --> 05:46.967
MAX: Ramse had a first shot.

05:47.097 --> 05:50.009
RAMSE: I know.
I swear to you on my life.

05:51.142 --> 05:52.222
MAX: You guys.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.801
It all goes back to Godel.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.564
- Continuum hypothesis.
- (ALL LAUGH)

05:59.734 --> 06:02.726
What?
The Godel metric closed timeline curves.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.728
Kurt Friederich Godel.

06:07.868 --> 06:13.659
The theory being,
if our timeline is reset... poof.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.576
And we're all just erased?

06:15.750 --> 06:20.870
This version of ourself will cease
to exist and our mission will be over.

06:21.006 --> 06:23.622
- Oh, God. She said mission.
- COLE: Drink.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.589
- RAMSE: She said mission.
- What?

06:25.760 --> 06:29.002
Another shot. Oh, man.

06:29.139 --> 06:32.097
I don't understand. Do I say that a lot?

06:33.059 --> 06:35.926
- I got a question for you.
- JONES: OK.

06:36.062 --> 06:40.681
Before we disappear,
something's been stumping me and Cole.

06:42.986 --> 06:44.396
Uh...

06:44.529 --> 06:45.985
BOTH: Jones.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.150
-Jones.
-Jones.

06:48.283 --> 06:51.571
It's not exactly German.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.910
No, it's not German.

06:55.040 --> 07:00.251
It's my husband, Jones.
My maiden name was Werner.

07:01.212 --> 07:02.793
You were married?

07:07.260 --> 07:09.342
Just for a few days.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.212
MAX: Uh-huh.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.065
I'm sorry. I...

07:26.446 --> 07:29.188
- ljust have still work to do.
- ALL: Yeah.

07:29.324 --> 07:31.440
JONES: Before you splinter tomorrow.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.781
Sleep well.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.460
(EXPLOSION)

07:44.631 --> 07:46.963
(SHOUTING)

07:47.092 --> 07:50.129
- MAN: Shut down the power source!
- What the hell's going on?

07:50.261 --> 07:52.798
We had a surge.
The core, it's completely unstable.

07:52.973 --> 07:57.057
There's damage to the emitter relays.
The reactor crossover is fried.

07:57.227 --> 07:58.967
I want it back online by morning!

08:00.522 --> 08:05.437
Jones, the core is running out ofjuice.
We didn't anticipate so many jumps.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.399
Splintering tomorrow is risky.

08:07.570 --> 08:09.947
- Works for me.
- Why are you in a hurry?

08:10.073 --> 08:14.316
Take a day to fix it. Take a week,
take a month. It's a time machine.

08:14.452 --> 08:18.070
Every day we wait, the core degrades
further. The virus could mutate.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.868
Deacon could come
knocking on the door again.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.083
- lt'll work.
- Hey.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.202
What the hell is wrong with you?

08:26.339 --> 08:29.172
Listen, | get that you're in a rush
to delete yourself.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.042
- Easy, man.
- That one's in a mad dash too.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.918
You guys are being reckless.

08:34.055 --> 08:36.262
We're getting close
to the end of this thing.

08:36.391 --> 08:40.384
- If she's right about tomorrow...
- It'd never have happened. I get it.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.057
And you won't be around
to hear me say I told you so.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.235
JONES: Initiate splinter sequence.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.338
CASSIE: Notice anything weird
about that place?

09:10.467 --> 09:14.005
I'm from the apocalypse.
Everything here looks weird to me.

09:15.847 --> 09:20.841
Check out the roof. The power cables,
generators, solar backup.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.935
Enough voltage to power the UV lights
Henri told you about.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.600
That's the Night Room.

09:25.774 --> 09:28.356
It ain't Mr. Bee's restaurant supply.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.487
Good work.

09:37.952 --> 09:41.160
- Whoa. What's our plan?
- We get a closer look.

09:41.289 --> 09:43.655
- Yeah, we need a plan.
- That is the plan.

09:43.792 --> 09:45.032
We get a closer look.

09:45.168 --> 09:49.207
I've seen that face before,
right before you shot Leland Goines.

09:50.381 --> 09:53.748
Look, Cassie, this is it.

09:53.968 --> 09:56.880
You found it, what we've been
looking for this whole time.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.137
This is the Night Room.

09:59.265 --> 10:03.884
I'm gonna be careful, OK, but one way
or another, I'm getting into that lab.

10:37.011 --> 10:39.548
- I don't like this.
- OK, I know what I'm doing.

10:45.019 --> 10:48.182
Hey. Who are you? Huh?

10:48.731 --> 10:52.474
Who are you? Where's the lab?

10:53.194 --> 10:56.402
It's... it's... it's downstairs.

10:56.531 --> 11:00.945
Who else is down there?
Any security? Are they armed?

11:01.077 --> 11:03.238
Answer me.

11:04.956 --> 11:08.574
I'm sorry.
They already know you're here.

11:44.078 --> 11:46.785
- When did they get here?
- A few hours before you.

11:46.915 --> 11:50.248
- Where's your security?
- They're all dead. They're all dead.

11:52.754 --> 11:55.712
All right, how many of them are there?
I count six down here.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.715
- Any of 'em yours?
- There's no one else. It's only me.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.083
Everyone else is gone.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.381
Markridge has gotta check up
on this place.

12:02.513 --> 12:05.676
They made security
call in the all-clear before they...

12:07.101 --> 12:09.387
All the outgoing alarms
have been disabled.

12:09.520 --> 12:14.514
The home office has no idea there's a
problem. I'm sorry, who... who are you?

12:14.692 --> 12:18.150
- Cassandra Railly. I'm a virologist.
- And the people down there?

12:18.279 --> 12:21.237
- What do they... What do they want?
- A virus.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.652
Something Leland Goines
was working on here.

12:23.785 --> 12:27.369
Frost's M510 strain. Yeah,
we keep the precursor in the vault.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.158
- Can you open it?
- The vault? No.

12:29.332 --> 12:31.698
No one stationed here can.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.251
(WHISTLING)

12:43.888 --> 12:45.970
The bird a nest.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.933
The spider a web.

12:57.068 --> 12:58.729
Here we give birth.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.524
Here it is born.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.361
- Bring down the Markridge man.
- CASSIE: What's that?

13:09.497 --> 13:12.330
- IVAN: We call it the Big Burn.
- Henri's lights.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.074
The wrong virus gets out,
you throw the switches

13:15.253 --> 13:18.290
and it burns up every bit
of biological material in the room.

13:18.423 --> 13:21.085
- Everything?
- At 1800 degrees, yes, everything.

13:21.217 --> 13:23.754
- Then let's use it.
- There's two switches.

13:23.886 --> 13:25.877
They've gotta both be thrown,
like a sub.

13:26.014 --> 13:29.427
And the other switch
is down there by the vault.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.675
But whoever throws that switch...

13:31.853 --> 13:34.469
Trust me, if you get exposed
to anything down there,

13:34.605 --> 13:36.641
the Big Burn is a better out.

13:38.526 --> 13:39.686
Don't move.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.901
Hey. Hey, what are you doing with him?

13:42.030 --> 13:45.193
- No, hey, leave him alone.
- Cassie, hey, hey, hey. Let him go.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.325
Let him go.

13:50.288 --> 13:52.370
Can't save everyone.

13:53.416 --> 13:55.498
I thought that was the point.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.208
- They're going to kill us.
- It doesn't matter.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.882
I don't care about living
through the next two hours.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.050
The plague is right down there.

14:10.224 --> 14:13.011
This is why I'm here.
This is what I came here for.

14:13.186 --> 14:16.770
We've gotten this far. We have to
get down there and destroy it.

14:23.988 --> 14:27.230
MAN: I 'm sorry about what happened
to your friends today.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.449
I know that was hard to see.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.736
And I don't expect you
to fully understand,

14:32.872 --> 14:34.954
but this...

14:37.668 --> 14:40.000
...this is an important moment.

14:40.713 --> 14:44.171
He broke Jennifer. She led 'em here.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.291
Do you think she's still alive?

14:47.720 --> 14:54.637
When you open that door for us,
we're gonna set things right.

14:57.188 --> 14:59.270
I don't know how to open it.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.561
- I swear to you, I don't.
- You what?

15:02.693 --> 15:04.684
I don't know how to open it,
I swear to you.

15:04.821 --> 15:09.406
I'll do whatever you ask.
ljust wanna see my wife again.

15:09.534 --> 15:12.071
Please, I don't know.

15:17.750 --> 15:18.865
I believe you.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.673
Your wife, is... is she pretty?

15:26.551 --> 15:28.633
Yeah, yes.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.841
Just close your eyes.

15:34.392 --> 15:35.928
Ooh.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.437
Close your eyes. Whoa.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.431
Imagine her face.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.063
Plan B.

16:08.718 --> 16:12.131
This is what being erased feels like?

16:12.305 --> 16:15.012
Mm-hm. Exactly.

16:18.352 --> 16:22.061
Excuse me. Pardon. Pardon me. Hi.

16:22.190 --> 16:26.183
I know you guys are hard at work,
but like ljust discovered something.

16:26.360 --> 16:30.729
Are these my hands?
Oh, my God! We're still here.

16:30.865 --> 16:35.859
- Sarcasm. I like it.
- Hey, he still alive?

16:35.995 --> 16:37.781
We got his tracer signal.

16:38.789 --> 16:40.575
You're not answering my question.

16:48.883 --> 16:52.375
- You see that look she gave me?
- Yeah, I saw that look she gave you.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.753
Why does Cole trust her?

16:54.889 --> 16:56.971
I don't know.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.676
- Doctor Grim.
- What?

17:01.854 --> 17:03.936
That's what they call her.

17:05.066 --> 17:08.558
- That's what who calls her?
- West 7.

17:09.487 --> 17:14.732
There are stories about a German doctor
who turns people inside out.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.404
- Experiments.
- That's scav ghost stories.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.620
- That's pretty specific, though.
- No, that's not Jones.

17:20.748 --> 17:22.989
No, must be the other German doctor.

17:24.460 --> 17:28.920
I always thought that Deacon just made
shit up to keep us from running off.

17:29.840 --> 17:33.708
But now... Shit, Ramse.

17:33.844 --> 17:37.632
You guys are running with a lady
who sends people through time.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.553
How well do you even know her?

17:51.612 --> 17:53.193
Jennifer?

17:53.364 --> 17:55.480
Jennifer!

17:55.658 --> 17:57.740
(MICE SQUEAK)

18:03.541 --> 18:05.577
- (WHISTLING)
- That's not good.

18:25.479 --> 18:29.643
Surely Henri told you how to get
into the vault in Haiti, right?

18:30.901 --> 18:32.937
Cos we can't ask him now.

18:34.655 --> 18:36.737
Or Leland Goines.

18:38.701 --> 18:40.407
You look nervous.

18:40.578 --> 18:42.660
Me?

18:48.628 --> 18:50.710
No.

18:54.717 --> 18:56.423
So this is bamboo.

18:57.511 --> 18:58.967
That's beautiful, isn't it?

18:59.096 --> 19:01.758
Jennifer didn't tell you
about the vault, did she?

19:02.850 --> 19:05.011
(YELLS)

19:05.144 --> 19:08.432
Stop! He can't tell you
how to get into the vault.

19:11.942 --> 19:17.232
No, I believe you.
This is not some kind of interrogation.

19:17.365 --> 19:20.983
Please stop. You're insane.

19:22.370 --> 19:25.783
No, insanity and rationality may be
on opposite sides of the animal,

19:25.915 --> 19:29.999
but lately, Doctor,
the snake is eating its own tail.

19:31.212 --> 19:34.704
And if you were to ask... him,

19:34.840 --> 19:39.254
he would tell you that 99.9%
of all species that have ever existed

19:39.387 --> 19:41.218
are now extinct.

19:41.347 --> 19:45.886
- The natural order.
- Him? You mean God?

19:48.229 --> 19:50.766
No, no, not God.

19:53.651 --> 19:55.232
The Witness.

19:56.654 --> 20:00.238
Is that your boss?
What exactly has this asshole witnessed?

20:00.366 --> 20:03.233
Enough to know the natural order
is no longer sufficient.

20:03.369 --> 20:06.782
Why don't you call him down here
and we can all have a chat?

20:06.914 --> 20:09.872
A chat? Have a chat?

20:12.837 --> 20:13.997
(YELLS)

20:15.881 --> 20:18.133
That's not your usual solution.

20:19.844 --> 20:22.551
Not with Leland.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.428
Or Henri in Haiti.

20:26.308 --> 20:28.560
Your answer was a bullet.

20:28.686 --> 20:32.929
How many more do you have to kill
before this is over?

20:34.775 --> 20:36.606
We're ready.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.101
Oh, OK.

20:38.279 --> 20:40.065
Excuse me.

20:40.197 --> 20:43.940
Um, bring 'em upstairs.
I want them to see this.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.709
CASSIE: Is it true?

20:54.712 --> 20:56.293
Did you kill Henri?

20:58.299 --> 21:00.381
Cole.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.468
- Answer me.
- I didn't have a choice.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.186
Jennifer?

21:14.315 --> 21:17.682
JENNIFER: I don't wanna see it.
Please don't make me see it.

21:17.818 --> 21:21.060
Jennifer. Jennifer, it's me, it's Cole.

21:46.722 --> 21:48.804
Hello.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.292
They're gonna open it.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.462
I don't want it to see me.

23:52.556 --> 23:54.296
How dare you!

23:55.184 --> 23:57.800
What the hell is this? Huh?

23:59.772 --> 24:01.353
What'd you do to these people?

24:05.611 --> 24:07.567
CoIe wasn't the first, was he?

24:09.573 --> 24:12.531
No. There were others.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.660
Others lost in time.

24:22.461 --> 24:23.962
What the hell is that thing?

24:28.384 --> 24:30.466
The origin...

24:32.429 --> 24:34.511
...of my father's virus.

24:38.936 --> 24:40.267
MAN: We're in.

24:40.396 --> 24:42.637
- Let's get the remains and get out.
- Yes, sir.

24:46.110 --> 24:48.852
(SCREAMS)

24:49.989 --> 24:55.234
Yes! Booyah, Tall Man! Failsafes!

24:56.412 --> 25:00.121
Boom! I got him, Otter Eyes. I got him.

25:01.291 --> 25:03.156
Attention, Night Room shoppers,

25:03.293 --> 25:05.204
Markridge commandos
are on the way.

25:05.337 --> 25:09.046
- Jennifer, what are you talking about?
- Monkeys can't get in the vault.

25:09.174 --> 25:12.382
I mean, they can,
not without melting like Raiders.

25:12.553 --> 25:13.963
Like... like...

25:14.096 --> 25:19.307
(BABBLES) I led 'em here.
I knew they'd crack the vault.

25:19.435 --> 25:23.178
But what they don't know,
the home office has just been pinged.

25:23.313 --> 25:25.304
Markridge security's on the way.

25:26.692 --> 25:29.900
- Quick question. Who's this bitch?
- I'm Dr. Railly, Jennifer.

25:30.029 --> 25:33.988
No more doctors. Always saying my name,
Jennifer, Jennifer.

25:34.116 --> 25:36.858
- But never specifying which one.
- OK, it's all right.

25:36.994 --> 25:38.950
Cassie helped me find you.

25:41.623 --> 25:43.488
Thank you. You can go now.

25:43.625 --> 25:47.368
OK, look, Markridge security's never
just gonna let us walk out of here.

25:47.504 --> 25:50.462
We need to figure a way out, OK?

25:50.591 --> 25:53.378
- Jennifer!
- (GROANS)

25:53.510 --> 25:57.594
You say it right. You say my name
and the voices stop to listen.

25:57.723 --> 26:00.385
- OK.
- Those otter eyes.

26:00.559 --> 26:03.346
Like two full moons
pulling back the tide.

26:11.403 --> 26:14.611
Jennifer Goines,
you're needed downstairs.

26:14.740 --> 26:18.608
Uh-oh. You're mad. I'm sorry.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.371
Ow!

26:28.003 --> 26:29.994
JONES: They were experiments,

26:30.130 --> 26:32.997
specimens sent through time.

26:33.133 --> 26:36.375
And completely necessary
to finish the project.

26:38.722 --> 26:42.715
Each one a little more progress
before we were ready to send Cole back.

26:44.228 --> 26:46.935
There's nothing
you wouldn't do for this?

26:49.399 --> 26:51.264
No.

26:51.401 --> 26:53.107
You better wake up, lady.

26:53.237 --> 26:58.106
In case you haven't noticed,
it's not working.

26:59.660 --> 27:01.742
Nothing's changed.

27:04.206 --> 27:05.491
We're still here.

27:07.084 --> 27:09.416
All you got is blood on your hands.

27:10.212 --> 27:12.328
Mr. Ramse...

27:13.924 --> 27:16.256
...have you ever heard Mozart?

27:17.302 --> 27:18.803
Or Beethoven?

27:22.099 --> 27:25.011
Debussy? Bach?

27:25.144 --> 27:27.556
He was my favorite.
You're too young to remember.

27:27.688 --> 27:29.553
I remember enough.

27:37.072 --> 27:41.156
It wasn't just the people.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.243
It was the ideas.

27:47.666 --> 27:48.781
The paintings.

27:50.752 --> 27:53.289
Rembrandt, Caravaggio.

27:55.299 --> 27:57.881
The books. Shakespeare.

27:58.969 --> 28:00.084
Tolstoy.

28:00.220 --> 28:02.836
And... the music.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.722
Oh, the music.

28:10.147 --> 28:12.388
Go. Go. Call me a monster.

28:17.571 --> 28:18.981
This is wrong.

28:19.114 --> 28:21.355
This was necessary.

28:24.244 --> 28:27.407
You don't think
I felt the pain of those men?

28:27.539 --> 28:29.530
You kept going.

28:29.708 --> 28:34.168
Because in a thousand generations
we could not rebuild what was lost!

28:38.675 --> 28:43.135
What is the lives of a few people...

28:44.765 --> 28:47.757
...compared to
the whole of human history?

28:50.520 --> 28:55.355
Without it... there's nothing.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.312
Nothing. No future.

28:58.445 --> 29:00.527
Just"

29:03.283 --> 29:08.653
Just drifting... in the ocean of time.

29:13.293 --> 29:15.375
No shore in sight.

29:16.880 --> 29:18.962
You tell me the truth.

29:24.972 --> 29:27.213
This gonna happen to Cole?

29:27.349 --> 29:30.056
I won't let it happen.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.854
It matters.

29:38.986 --> 29:41.102
It matters what we do here.

29:43.198 --> 29:44.984
This time.

29:55.294 --> 29:58.377
# AII them Markridge boys
are comin' with their guns

29:58.505 --> 30:01.713
# All them Markridge boys are comin'
with their clipboards and their guns #

30:01.842 --> 30:03.878
OK, Tall Man,
I got a suggestion, though.

30:04.011 --> 30:07.344
I really think
that we should do this hand again.

30:07.472 --> 30:09.258
You've already made inroads here

30:09.391 --> 30:13.600
and Daddy's tin soldiers got a 20-minute
turnaround, so... chop, chop.

30:14.938 --> 30:17.224
- Jennifer, you deceived us.
- Shit, no, son.

30:17.357 --> 30:19.814
I'm Honest Abe.
I'm chopping down cherry trees.

30:19.943 --> 30:25.108
Hey, I did not have sexual relations
with that woman.

30:25.240 --> 30:28.277
I cannot tell a lie,
so I told you half a truth.

30:28.410 --> 30:30.571
- And the other half?
- Buried.

30:30.704 --> 30:33.992
Desert island. Palm trees and coconuts.

30:34.124 --> 30:36.740
The answer's in that cage of yours.

30:36.918 --> 30:38.499
I am a cage, Tall Man.

30:38.628 --> 30:42.166
The things that scurry
behind the walls in my head...

30:42.299 --> 30:46.417
- Look in my eyes. Do you see them?
- Hold her! Please hold her.

30:48.805 --> 30:52.263
How many more things
can we fit inside that head of yours?

30:55.187 --> 30:57.018
The code to the failsafe, please.

30:57.189 --> 31:00.147
Wild eyes. Sharper teeth.

31:00.275 --> 31:02.186
Like Cole.

31:02.319 --> 31:05.311
I only tell my secrets to Cole.

31:08.658 --> 31:09.647
You care for Cole?

31:11.661 --> 31:15.495
And you don't realize that
he's a flytrap and you're just a fly.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.872
He spun a web for your father

31:22.005 --> 31:25.463
and pulled the trigger
and wrapped your father.

31:28.345 --> 31:29.676
Cole killed my daddy?

31:32.682 --> 31:34.764
Cole killed my daddy?

31:37.020 --> 31:38.260
Cole killed my daddy?

31:38.438 --> 31:41.100
See, that's a secret
the man forgot to tell you.

31:41.274 --> 31:43.651
Cole killed my daddy?

31:43.777 --> 31:46.519
Cole killed my daddy?

31:46.655 --> 31:48.816
(LAUGHS)

31:51.827 --> 31:53.192
We gotta get out of here.

31:56.123 --> 31:58.535
Henﬁ.

31:58.667 --> 32:02.376
- Just tell me why.
- They would have found him.

32:02.504 --> 32:04.870
I couldn't let that happen.

32:05.006 --> 32:07.497
They would have found him.
They would have...

32:08.260 --> 32:10.842
- They would have found him.
- The Night Room.

32:13.056 --> 32:15.138
I trusted you.

32:17.310 --> 32:21.349
I had a good life before I met you.

32:21.481 --> 32:23.563
A full life.

32:26.486 --> 32:29.319
Now there's just death.

32:31.575 --> 32:36.569
Ramse and I,
we, uh... we had rules for ourselves.

32:38.081 --> 32:42.074
Never kill in anger,
only for self-defense.

32:44.921 --> 32:47.708
Then that became food and shelter.

32:49.301 --> 32:52.543
This one day we raided this farmhouse

32:52.679 --> 32:57.093
and there was this... old couple.

32:59.269 --> 33:00.679
The husband went down easy.

33:01.813 --> 33:05.522
But the old lady, she... she was quick.

33:06.651 --> 33:08.733
She got a knife in me before I...

33:13.867 --> 33:18.907
And, uh... so I did it.

33:23.585 --> 33:30.332
She, uh... she looked up at me
and she smiled.

33:32.969 --> 33:35.051
Like she forgave me.

33:38.350 --> 33:44.141
And I never knew it before that moment,
but... that was what I wanted.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.060
Forgiveness?

33:50.153 --> 33:53.941
I don't deserve it. I know that.

33:56.076 --> 33:58.237
But that's what I've been
rushing towards,

33:58.411 --> 34:01.699
just trying to make everything
make sense.

34:03.750 --> 34:06.708
And that's what this is.

34:06.836 --> 34:11.125
You know, if I can... if I can fix this,

34:11.258 --> 34:13.374
if I can fix it...

34:15.679 --> 34:18.261
...then all of it
won't have been for nothing.

34:19.474 --> 34:21.430
Maybe if you found somebody else.

34:22.352 --> 34:25.970
You're willing to do what is needed
and I'm not.

34:26.773 --> 34:28.855
I can't.

34:29.818 --> 34:33.686
I just wanna heal people, fix things.

34:35.657 --> 34:37.739
That's good.

34:38.702 --> 34:40.693
You don't wanna be like me.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.661
No.

34:43.790 --> 34:46.702
(YELLING)

34:46.835 --> 34:49.622
Hey, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey. Hey.

34:52.507 --> 34:55.499
Oh, he told me, Cole.

34:57.053 --> 35:00.466
You. You did it.

35:01.474 --> 35:02.805
You killed Daddy.

35:07.564 --> 35:12.900
That... That is awesome.

35:17.866 --> 35:19.026
Cole, they're leaving.

35:19.159 --> 35:21.775
Monkeys don't wanna face off
against Daddy's commandos.

35:21.911 --> 35:23.822
Neither do we. We're fish in a barrel.

35:23.955 --> 35:26.071
If we don't get out of this room,
we're dead.

35:26.207 --> 35:28.619
Come on.

35:33.173 --> 35:35.789
Did you just unlock the door?

35:36.843 --> 35:39.755
- She has the code.
- First rule of growing up Goines.

35:39.888 --> 35:43.597
Don't trust Daddy. I have all the codes.

35:43.725 --> 35:45.340
Wait a minute. You have the codes.

35:45.560 --> 35:51.055
That means you can get us
into the vault... past the failsafe.

35:52.651 --> 35:55.142
Let's get what we came here for.

36:02.285 --> 36:03.821
Wait up.

36:07.082 --> 36:09.164
OK, come on.

36:14.381 --> 36:16.997
Wait. If we break the tank open
to destroy that thing,

36:17.133 --> 36:19.044
the pathogen could become airborne.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.759
- We all need masks.
- I'm immune.

36:21.888 --> 36:23.844
I'm not. She probably isn't.

36:23.973 --> 36:25.964
OK, take that one. I saw one upstairs.

36:26.142 --> 36:28.394
Hurry. Come on, open it.

36:33.608 --> 36:35.940
Come on.

36:36.069 --> 36:38.151
Come on.

36:40.115 --> 36:42.197
How about the failsafe?

36:44.202 --> 36:48.787
Jennifer, the virus in there is gonna
kill everyone. We need to destroy it.

36:48.915 --> 36:51.372
COMPUTER:
Please enter failsafe password.

36:51.543 --> 36:55.377
Come on, OK? You can do it. Open it.

36:57.590 --> 36:59.672
Good.

37:03.596 --> 37:05.882
I told them I'd never, ever open it.

37:07.183 --> 37:09.265
Only for you.

37:13.106 --> 37:16.189
- Only for me?
- I'd do anything for you.

37:16.317 --> 37:18.694
Wait a minute. They're still here. Stop!

37:30.832 --> 37:34.825
See, the thing about Jennifer is,
if you can cut through all that noise,

37:35.003 --> 37:38.916
she's always true to her word,
and hence our little exit show.

37:42.010 --> 37:44.467
You're almost done, Jennifer.
Please finish.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.969
Don't do it.

37:47.932 --> 37:49.968
- TALL MAN: Deactivate it.
- Don't.

37:51.895 --> 37:54.136
COMPUTER: Failsafe activated.

37:54.272 --> 37:57.435
- Please enter failsafe password.
- Don't do it.

38:05.408 --> 38:11.074
I was hoping for the M510 to be already
cultivated, but I can settle for this.

38:15.376 --> 38:19.836
Inside that old meat...
a centuries-old virus.

38:29.766 --> 38:31.848
There's something about its eyes.

39:22.277 --> 39:24.814
(SCREAMING)

39:44.299 --> 39:46.711
MAX: Ramse. You go in there?

39:46.843 --> 39:50.051
- Yeah.
- I was right, you found something.

39:50.179 --> 39:53.797
Like I said before,
bullshit ghost story.

39:53.933 --> 39:56.015
That's bullshit.

39:56.144 --> 39:59.557
- Right.
- Let it go.

40:01.107 --> 40:02.938
- You actually trust her?
- No.

40:03.109 --> 40:07.102
I don't trust her and I don't trust you.
Focus on the mission.

40:07.238 --> 40:09.980
- What about Cole?
- Due back any moment.

40:10.116 --> 40:12.573
(COUGHING)

40:27.258 --> 40:28.418
Why am I still here?

40:30.553 --> 40:32.839
- (GROANS)
- Cole.

40:37.310 --> 40:38.470
Something's wrong.

40:40.188 --> 40:41.394
Cassie.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.351
Come on.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.501
(GROANS)

41:05.672 --> 41:09.915
- No, not now.
- What?

41:13.429 --> 41:15.636
- Cassie!
- Cole!

41:19.352 --> 41:21.434
(GROANS)

41:24.107 --> 41:26.189
(TYRES SCREECH)

41:43.167 --> 41:45.249
Cassie!

42:10.820 --> 42:12.902
What the hell's going on?

42:14.824 --> 42:16.906
Jones?

42:18.619 --> 42:20.701
Ramse?

42:35.636 --> 42:36.716
West 7.
