WEBVTT

00:01.468 --> 00:04.357
We committed adultery!
Forgive me!

00:05.668 --> 00:07.739
You can stay with me
as long as you need.

00:07.852 --> 00:09.424
I've signed up for a
musical review,

00:09.517 --> 00:12.402
they assigned me to dream
the impossible dream.

00:12.492 --> 00:15.744
I come from a sperm donor.
I'm trying to find my father.

00:15.810 --> 00:18.812
Emily was attacked by
a homosexual tiger.

00:18.928 --> 00:20.676
I was rebuilding our
relationship and

00:20.774 --> 00:23.199
now I'm not a father any more!

00:23.283 --> 00:24.271
I'm a trigger!

00:24.361 --> 00:25.915
- Jonathan Ames?
- Yes?

00:26.011 --> 00:29.166
I have information about
your biological father.

01:26.930 --> 01:29.570
Do all detectives keep
white wine in their desks?

01:29.604 --> 01:31.477
No, most detectives
in literature have whiskey,

01:31.511 --> 01:33.886
but tend to black out and
throw up on the brown stuff.

01:33.921 --> 01:35.860
I used to be weak that way.

01:35.894 --> 01:38.100
Every time I would drink scotch,
I would lose my panties.

01:38.134 --> 01:40.040
It was always annoying
the next morning.

01:40.074 --> 01:42.917
So you said on the phone
that you had

01:42.951 --> 01:44.421
some information
about my father.

01:44.455 --> 01:46.428
About both our missing fathers.

01:46.463 --> 01:49.404
I also began life
at the Hudson sperm bank.

01:49.439 --> 01:51.811
Well, it's wonderful
to meet a fellow donation.

01:51.846 --> 01:53.983
- You know the place burned dow right?
- I know.

01:54.017 --> 01:56.255
And the owner Donald Stark
has gone off the grid.

01:56.289 --> 01:58.763
You know the owner's name?

01:58.798 --> 02:02.072
Well, without Stark
there are no records,

02:02.107 --> 02:03.744
so we've hit the same dead end.

02:03.779 --> 02:05.750
That's not true.

02:05.784 --> 02:08.524
- I found Fishman.
- Fishman?

02:08.558 --> 02:12.232
Fishman, who witnessed
the devastating fire.

02:12.266 --> 02:15.006
Fishman-- His face
blackened by smoke.

02:15.040 --> 02:17.679
Fishman--
His hair singed.

02:17.714 --> 02:20.419
The same man was at each fire?

02:20.454 --> 02:23.093
Oh my God.
Fishman must be a--

02:23.127 --> 02:26.601
A professional firebug.
He is.

02:27.705 --> 02:29.375
Stark hired him
to burn the bank.

02:29.410 --> 02:31.047
Fishman is our link
to the records.

02:31.081 --> 02:33.887
- And you need me to find him.
- I already have.

02:33.922 --> 02:35.457
Aw, come on!

02:35.492 --> 02:37.095
He's in Rikers.
He's doing eight to 10.

02:37.130 --> 02:38.565
I'm seeing him
tomorrow morning.

02:38.599 --> 02:40.035
You've practically
solved the case.

02:40.070 --> 02:42.173
- Why do you want to hire me?
- I don't.

02:42.207 --> 02:44.311
I felt sorry for you when I
saw you on the Cavett Show.

02:44.345 --> 02:47.350
You looked so lost
and disturbed.

02:47.385 --> 02:49.488
Is it because I went
crotch closed

02:49.523 --> 02:51.659
- instead of crotch open?
- Yes.

02:51.694 --> 02:53.832
I knew I should have
gone crotch open.

02:53.866 --> 02:57.039
My friend George told me
I should do crotch closed.

02:57.073 --> 02:59.376
His fault.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.585
Hey, leah, don't know why
you're not calling me back.

03:03.620 --> 03:05.523
I'm not sure if it's because
I cheated on you

03:05.558 --> 03:07.461
or because you lost
my phone number.

03:07.495 --> 03:09.432
But listen,
if it's the cheating,

03:09.466 --> 03:12.405
call me back, ok?
This is Ray.

03:12.439 --> 03:15.011
Hey, Emily.
Dad again-- Your father.

03:15.045 --> 03:17.581
Um, call me back
sometime, sweetie.

03:17.615 --> 03:19.284
( Chuckles )

03:19.319 --> 03:20.821
No luck.

03:20.856 --> 03:22.724
Me neither.

03:22.758 --> 03:24.495
I wish leah would go ahead
and forgive me already.

03:24.529 --> 03:26.065
I don't know
what's taking so long.

03:26.099 --> 03:28.470
You're just gonna have
to suffer for a while, Ray.

03:28.504 --> 03:31.776
That's all there is to it.
It's your penance.

03:31.811 --> 03:35.885
Well, the weird thing is I kind of
don't want the pain to be over.

03:35.920 --> 03:39.592
That's because when the
pain ends, the love ends.

03:39.626 --> 03:42.966
Come to bed, Ray.
Come on.

03:45.805 --> 03:48.677
So is that neck sling
helping at all?

03:48.711 --> 03:53.520
Well, I feel taller,
but my back still hurts.

03:53.555 --> 03:55.859
Well, I've got
something for you then.

03:55.894 --> 03:57.829
Oh, like a present?

03:57.864 --> 04:00.167
Well...

04:00.201 --> 04:02.001
Oh, it's a book.

04:02.035 --> 04:04.002
Great.

04:04.037 --> 04:07.038
"Healing back pain,
the mind-body connection."

04:07.073 --> 04:09.272
Dr. John E. Sarno.

04:09.306 --> 04:11.640
I hear that it works wonders.

04:11.674 --> 04:14.174
And here's another
gift for you.

04:14.209 --> 04:17.942
- What's this?
- Well, this is for your nose, Ray.

04:17.976 --> 04:20.077
Your snoring is starting
to unravel me.

04:20.111 --> 04:24.947
The revue is tomorrow night
and I need my rest.

04:26.917 --> 04:28.717
( Snoring )

04:30.720 --> 04:32.754
( Snores ) Yeah, I think
this thing's working.

04:32.788 --> 04:36.590
Sometimes you just irritate
the hell out of me.

04:36.624 --> 04:39.728
Hey, George, will you get me
a glass of juice, please?

04:39.762 --> 04:43.198
Half guava, half apple
with a splash of orange

04:43.232 --> 04:44.899
and a little hint of grapefruit

04:44.933 --> 04:48.035
d a segment of lime, quickly.

04:50.437 --> 04:53.138
We want Donald Stark.
Where is he?

04:53.172 --> 04:54.772
I've already told you

04:54.806 --> 04:57.707
I had nothing to do
with that sperm shop.

04:57.741 --> 04:59.674
I was out looking for my cat.

04:59.709 --> 05:02.810
I smelled smoke--
Piqued my interest.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.578
Liar!

05:04.613 --> 05:06.079
You seem like a dog person.

05:06.114 --> 05:07.714
- No.
- Really?

05:07.749 --> 05:09.583
Were you out looking for
your cat on this night?

05:09.617 --> 05:11.118
How about this night?

05:11.152 --> 05:13.286
Did you find your pussy
on this night?

05:13.320 --> 05:14.587
- Okay.
- What about that night?

05:14.622 --> 05:16.922
Yeah, seems like
a lot of nights.

05:16.990 --> 05:20.425
Great. Caught me
in a little lie, did ya?

05:20.459 --> 05:22.426
But I'm a pro, honey.

05:22.461 --> 05:24.594
You think I got where I am
by being a snitch?

05:24.629 --> 05:28.398
- Rikers? Ha.
- Okay, don't rub it in, girlie.

05:28.432 --> 05:31.867
I will rub it in.
I need to find my father.

05:31.902 --> 05:35.470
- Please, help me.
- ( Whimpers )

05:35.505 --> 05:38.573
Yeah, help us.

05:40.842 --> 05:46.345
You know, I grew up
in an orphanage.

05:46.379 --> 05:48.880
It's where I first
started lighting fires--

05:48.915 --> 05:50.415
For the attention.

05:50.450 --> 05:53.952
Who knew it would blossom
into a career, right?

05:53.987 --> 05:58.290
Well, then you know what it's
like to want to find your family.

05:58.324 --> 06:03.227
Yeah, I do.

06:08.532 --> 06:11.468
- Used to be Stark, want used to be a number
- Of other names too,

06:11.502 --> 06:14.671
but he burns a business
about once every year.

06:14.705 --> 06:18.207
- Where can we find him?
- He runs a cap store out on Coney Island--

06:18.241 --> 06:20.509
Susquehanna Hats
on Bagel Street.

06:20.543 --> 06:24.412
- Mr. Fishman, I could kick you.
- Really?

06:24.447 --> 06:25.947
Then what's
stopping you, honey?

06:25.981 --> 06:27.581
I got three more years
in this shitbox.

06:27.616 --> 06:30.316
- Come on, give it to me.
- ( Reaming )

06:30.351 --> 06:32.552
- Whoa whoa whoa! Fishman!
- ( Screaming continues )

06:32.586 --> 06:34.387
That's enough, buddy!

06:34.421 --> 06:38.057
Oh! Oh, man!
I was so close to that.

06:38.091 --> 06:40.158
<i>I almost had it</i> <i>in there.</i>

06:40.193 --> 06:42.126
Are you all right?

06:42.161 --> 06:44.261
Thank you.

06:47.866 --> 06:51.001
( Snoring )

07:04.680 --> 07:06.547
( Sighs )

07:16.357 --> 07:19.225
Hey, George?

07:19.260 --> 07:22.328
George, I'm healed!
Praise Sarno!

07:22.362 --> 07:24.196
George, George.

07:24.230 --> 07:27.132
George, wake up.
There's been a miracle.

07:27.166 --> 07:28.733
What's-- What's going--?

07:28.767 --> 07:31.201
It's bare--
It's barely 10:00.

07:31.236 --> 07:33.303
Was there a financial crisis?

07:33.338 --> 07:34.838
My back pain
is completely gone.

07:34.872 --> 07:37.707
- Your book healed my back.
- You read the whole thing?

07:37.741 --> 07:39.842
No, I read the whole back cover

07:39.877 --> 07:41.810
and then I slept on it,
and the combination worked.

07:41.845 --> 07:43.712
Well, that's wonderful.

07:43.746 --> 07:46.380
I mean, the book
must have seeped into you.

07:46.414 --> 07:47.981
Sarno said I invented
my back spasms

07:48.015 --> 07:49.582
so I wouldn't feel
anything else.

07:49.616 --> 07:51.083
You got that
from the back cover?

07:51.117 --> 07:52.817
Yeah.
Isn't that amazing?

07:52.851 --> 07:54.351
I'm in charge.

07:54.386 --> 07:56.353
I'm in charge!

07:56.387 --> 07:58.688
Ray Hueston is
in charge of his body.

07:58.722 --> 08:03.124
- Ray Hueston is in charge--
- Ooh ooh! Are you okay?

08:03.158 --> 08:05.959
I'm good.
I'm still in charge.

08:05.994 --> 08:07.828
( Bones cracking )

08:07.863 --> 08:10.431
I'll take the lead with Bergeron
since you were in charge

08:10.465 --> 08:11.965
of the Fishman
interrogation, okay?

08:12.000 --> 08:13.400
Okay. Are you sure
you're up for it?

08:13.434 --> 08:17.203
I <i>am</i> a detective, you know?
Ooh, I love Ferris wheels.

08:17.237 --> 08:18.638
<i>Me too.</i>

08:18.672 --> 08:22.708
- W-we need to stay on task.
- Right.

08:22.742 --> 08:24.776
There's our meat.

08:26.345 --> 08:30.215
- Are you Harry Bergeron?
- Depends who's asking.

08:30.249 --> 08:31.917
- We are.
- Who's we?

08:31.951 --> 08:33.719
- Depends who's asking.
- I am.

08:33.753 --> 08:35.520
- Who's I?
- Depends who's asking.

08:35.554 --> 08:39.489
- I'm ask--
- Ah. Okay, we know you're Harrison Bergeron,

08:39.524 --> 08:41.256
but are you also Donald Stark

08:41.291 --> 08:44.593
who once owned the Hudson sperm
bank in Fair Lawn, New Jersey?

08:44.627 --> 08:46.995
Inside.

08:47.029 --> 08:49.831
Wipe your feet.

08:53.736 --> 08:54.669
Are you the cops?

08:54.704 --> 08:56.805
You look le graduate students.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.209
No, but I am getting my PhD

08:59.243 --> 09:00.710
in library science
from Columbia.

09:02.779 --> 09:04.580
But I am an unlicensed
private detective.

09:04.614 --> 09:07.783
So you're a shamus.
How'd you find me?

09:07.817 --> 09:09.484
As arsonist named Fishman
led us here.

09:09.518 --> 09:11.619
- We saw him at Rikers.
- Oh yeah?

09:11.653 --> 09:13.420
I always liked Fishman.

09:13.454 --> 09:15.822
It convenient when you're a
smoker to he him around.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.390
He's always quick with a match.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.058
Nice Jewish boy.

09:20.093 --> 09:23.762
But let's get to the point.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.797
What do you want with me?

09:25.831 --> 09:27.498
Are you with
the insurance companies?

09:27.533 --> 09:30.568
No, we're not interested
in your smoky trail of arson.

09:30.602 --> 09:33.903
We just want to know about
the sperm bank because...

09:33.938 --> 09:35.738
Well, we come from it.

09:35.773 --> 09:37.440
Oh.

09:38.508 --> 09:39.975
Well, it's been a long time

09:40.010 --> 09:41.710
since I was
in the sperm business.

09:41.745 --> 09:44.313
After that it was laundromats,
then liquor stores.

09:44.347 --> 09:46.981
I always try to provide
what's essential.

09:47.016 --> 09:48.850
But did you keep
any of the records?

09:48.884 --> 09:50.852
All I know about
my dad is that,

09:50.886 --> 09:53.521
well, he was Greek and he had
a beautiful singing voice.

09:53.555 --> 09:56.189
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart.

09:56.224 --> 09:59.092
When the building burned dow
everything was lost.

09:59.126 --> 10:01.860
Oh no.

10:01.895 --> 10:04.696
You hadn't engaged
in fraud, this girl might have be

10:04.730 --> 10:06.998
to find her father with the
beautiful singing voice.

10:07.032 --> 10:09.367
I hope you realize
what you've robbed her of.

10:09.401 --> 10:11.535
I understand, kid.

10:11.570 --> 10:14.004
When I was your age,
I was the same way--

10:14.038 --> 10:15.905
All chip and no shoulders.

10:15.940 --> 10:18.441
I've got shoulders,
two of them.

10:20.878 --> 10:22.612
You remember anything,
let's get out of here.

10:23.981 --> 10:26.482
Look, I'm-- I'm sorry
I couldn't be of more help.

10:26.516 --> 10:31.386
Would you-- Would you like
some wonder hats?

10:31.421 --> 10:33.655
Huh?
Half-price.

10:33.689 --> 10:36.690
- I like the pink one--
- No.

10:36.724 --> 10:40.126
We don't want any hats.
And I didn't wipe my feet.

10:43.831 --> 10:46.667
I can't give these things away.

10:49.103 --> 10:50.936
George: <i>Hey, sweetie.</i> <i>Dad again.</i>

10:50.971 --> 10:52.938
Just wondering whether you got

10:52.972 --> 10:56.108
all seven invitations
to my performance tonight.

10:56.142 --> 10:58.009
Bring Bernard.
Call me back.

10:58.043 --> 11:00.444
Or don't.
Just show up-- 8:00 pm.

11:00.479 --> 11:02.179
- <i>( Beeps )</i>
- I love-- Ugh.

11:02.214 --> 11:04.681
- Cut off again?
- Yes.

11:04.716 --> 11:07.084
Even her voicemail
seems to know it's me.

11:07.118 --> 11:08.752
This will cheer you up.

11:08.786 --> 11:11.854
- Take a look at this.
- Oh.

11:11.889 --> 11:15.157
This is before Sarno
and this is after Sarno.

11:15.192 --> 11:17.159
- George: <i>Oh God,</i> <i>this is wonderful.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

11:17.193 --> 11:19.561
- A little bulge there and everything.
- <i>Yep.</i>

11:19.595 --> 11:22.864
Now who's the misshapen dwarf
on super Ray's shoulder?

11:22.898 --> 11:24.665
That's not a dwarf.
That's my son.

11:24.700 --> 11:27.768
- That's Ser Spencer.
- Oh yeah. No, of course. No, I see that.

11:27.802 --> 11:29.336
I'll tell you
something though--

11:29.370 --> 11:31.771
That Sarno seems to have had
a powerful effect on you.

11:31.806 --> 11:33.472
Yeah, not that I know
that my back spasms

11:33.507 --> 11:34.874
were caused
by repressed emotions,

11:34.908 --> 11:36.342
I find I can really draw again.

11:36.376 --> 11:38.810
So what feeling
were you not feeling?

11:41.514 --> 11:43.814
Oh shit, I forgot
that part of it.

11:43.848 --> 11:45.683
Oh, hey hey, look, don't
question it, you know.

11:45.717 --> 11:48.652
You've had a breakthrough.
That's enough for one day.

11:48.686 --> 11:51.154
I tell you I haven't had
a breakthrough in years.

11:51.188 --> 11:55.191
Oh, Ray-- Ray, I am so very proud of you.

11:55.225 --> 11:56.992
George, what are you doing?

11:57.027 --> 11:59.228
I'm a real artist. Dot do that.
I'm not a child.

11:59.262 --> 12:02.230
But I tuck you in every night.

12:02.265 --> 12:04.099
I bring you food
from the restaurant.

12:04.393 --> 12:08.903
- I thought you liked being infantilized.
- Yeah, a-at my bedtime.

12:08.937 --> 12:11.371
And at my mealtime.

12:11.406 --> 12:14.374
Okay, all right.
Mr. grumpy.

12:15.442 --> 12:18.244
- ( Burbling )
- ( Laughs ) Stop.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.446
<i>( Music playing )</i>

12:20.481 --> 12:22.481
Sorry I got angry
back there at Bergeron's.

12:22.516 --> 12:23.983
It's just that I s so angry

12:24.017 --> 12:26.552
which is why
I got so... angry.

12:26.586 --> 12:27.986
I'm angry too.

12:28.020 --> 12:30.688
Now we'll never know what
diseases we're prone to.

12:30.722 --> 12:32.456
Yeah. I mean
that pisses me off.

12:32.490 --> 12:35.525
- I would have liked to have known those diseases.
- Me too.

12:35.560 --> 12:38.261
On my mother's side I have balding,
but that's not an illness.

12:38.295 --> 12:39.863
I just really wanted
to find my dad.

12:39.897 --> 12:43.433
I feel like there's
a-- A book missing fro.

12:43.467 --> 12:46.368
- Hmm.
- Hey,

12:46.403 --> 12:49.738
I know what will make us feel
better about those diseases.

12:52.307 --> 12:54.875
( People screaming )

12:54.909 --> 12:57.577
You know, my parents' first
date was to Coney island.

12:57.612 --> 13:00.180
That's romantic.

13:00.181 --> 13:03.916
- It's a shame your dad was sterile.
- Yeah.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.685
I always thought
I came from Brooklyn, romantic.

13:05.719 --> 13:07.386
But I guess that's not true

13:07.420 --> 13:12.357
I'm half Brooklyn,
half mystery.

13:14.160 --> 13:17.094
And you're half sexy
in your own y.

13:17.128 --> 13:20.530
You do have really big eyes.

13:20.565 --> 13:23.733
You know, a therapist
recently told me that.

13:25.669 --> 13:27.169
That was an opening
for you to kiss me

13:27.203 --> 13:30.371
I-- I didn't really want
to hear about therapy, but...

13:38.213 --> 13:41.715
I am the knight
of the mournful countenance.

13:41.749 --> 13:43.216
Giddy-up, Rocinante!

13:43.250 --> 13:45.918
Whoa, easy, boy.

13:45.952 --> 13:49.488
Ah, my beautiful don quixote.

13:49.522 --> 13:52.257
Josephine, thank god you came early.

13:55.094 --> 13:56.594
I need a warm-up.

13:56.628 --> 13:59.129
Not a problem.
I'm not wearing any panties.

13:59.164 --> 14:01.265
What? Really?

14:01.299 --> 14:05.302
No no, I-- I meant, you know,
maybe scales or something.

14:05.336 --> 14:09.071
I mean I'm happy that we made
love every lesson, but...

14:09.105 --> 14:11.973
I'm a little nervous now
about actually singing.

14:12.008 --> 14:14.442
- It is too late for that now.
- What?

14:14.477 --> 14:17.578
This is the only lesson
you'll need.

14:19.647 --> 14:22.948
Now don't you feel
ready to sing?

14:22.982 --> 14:25.584
We, not exactly.

- Whoo.

14:34.359 --> 14:36.660
- Sorry I'm a screamer.
- That was amazing.

14:36.694 --> 14:39.829
I felt the room
and the bed move.

14:39.864 --> 14:42.198
I know I was
pretty good just now,

14:42.232 --> 14:44.133
better than usual actually,

14:44.167 --> 14:47.135
but the room a bed did move.

14:47.170 --> 14:51.439
The clock outside my window has
a nervous twitch once an hour.

14:51.473 --> 14:55.342
Oh. Oh right.

14:55.376 --> 14:58.345
Would you ever
consider solving cases

14:58.379 --> 15:01.314
on a more professional level?

15:01.348 --> 15:03.248
I've always been
a lone operator, but--

15:03.283 --> 15:06.384
I'll-- I'll give it
some thought.

15:06.419 --> 15:08.386
I could use a sidekick.

15:08.420 --> 15:10.621
Okay.

15:10.656 --> 15:13.357
And would you like to come

15:13.391 --> 15:15.859
to my friend's recital
with me tonight?

15:15.893 --> 15:18.328
It could be
our first official date.

15:18.362 --> 15:19.829
Oh, I can't.

15:19.863 --> 15:22.298
I have a night class
in parchment restoration.

15:23.767 --> 15:25.133
But do you think
the clock could twitch

15:25.168 --> 15:26.702
one more time before we leave?

15:26.736 --> 15:28.703
No, it only does that
once an hour.

15:28.738 --> 15:32.206
How did you solve any cases
before you met me?

15:34.175 --> 15:37.477
- Oh.

- Don quixote texting again?
- Yeah yeah.

16:01.734 --> 16:04.134
For a message from Emily
that's never gonna come.

16:04.169 --> 16:06.569
You know, George, you do look
a lot like Samuel Beckett.

16:06.604 --> 16:09.672
I know.
I've heard that before.

16:09.706 --> 16:13.041
It's depressing to look like
the most depressed writer ever.

16:13.076 --> 16:15.443
- Can I have one of these?
- Oh yeah, please.

16:15.477 --> 16:17.477
You know, Josephine
brought those to me.

16:17.511 --> 16:21.111
They're pot cookies
for after the show.

16:21.146 --> 16:23.714
- You want one?
- No, I'm on a natural high.

16:23.748 --> 16:26.650
I just had transcendent sex
with a girl named Rose.

16:26.684 --> 16:29.318
She's smart, pretty
and a great detective.

16:29.353 --> 16:31.620
- Wow.
- You only get stoned when you're unhappy?

16:31.655 --> 16:34.422
- That's not healthy.
- You're right.

16:36.025 --> 16:39.360
Oh my God.
That is so good.

16:39.394 --> 16:41.262
These chocolate chips
are very melty.

16:41.296 --> 16:44.197
Oh, I want melty chocolate.

16:44.232 --> 16:47.066
That's our cue.
Let's go.

16:48.335 --> 16:50.703
Oh oh, fellas,

16:50.738 --> 16:53.905
if Emily does show up,
put her stage left

16:53.940 --> 16:55.740
so she can see
my better cheekbone.

16:55.775 --> 16:58.242
I want her to be impressed
by her father tonight.

16:58.276 --> 16:59.643

son-in-law, I've missed you!

23:32.545 --> 23:36.415
- Come on.
- I'll be right there. ( Giggling )

23:36.449 --> 23:39.751
Ray, I love you, I do.

23:39.785 --> 23:41.550
And I know that you love me,

23:41.584 --> 23:44.051
but we don't make
each other happy.

23:44.085 --> 23:47.020
Well, that's gonna change.
I healed my back with my mind.

23:47.054 --> 23:51.158
- I can heal us.
- Ray, please.

23:51.193 --> 23:54.461
I know there's more good
than bad in our relationship,

23:54.495 --> 23:58.431
but what's bad has become
unbearable for me.

23:58.466 --> 23:59.932
Don't say that.

23:59.967 --> 24:02.034
I just think that
the kindest thing

24:02.068 --> 24:06.605
we can do for each other
is let each other go.

24:14.112 --> 24:16.647
( Sighs )

24:17.715 --> 24:19.649
I'm gonna miss you.

24:24.921 --> 24:28.189
Psst. Hey, Mr. shamus,
over here.

24:29.491 --> 24:32.327
Why are you whispering?

24:32.361 --> 24:34.462
All these fish make me nervous.

24:34.496 --> 24:36.430
I can't swim.

24:36.465 --> 24:39.766
I like herring in cream sauce.
That's about it.

24:39.801 --> 24:41.401
Forget the herring.
Why'd you want to see me?

24:41.435 --> 24:43.136
Are you familiar with St. Francis?

24:43.170 --> 24:45.871
Yes, sometimes he's an answer
in "the times" crossword.

24:45.905 --> 24:47.172
But do you know his prayer?

24:47.206 --> 24:49.975
"Better to forgive
than be forgiven."

24:50.009 --> 24:52.710
Better to understand
than be understood.

24:52.745 --> 24:55.279
"Better to love
than be loved."

24:55.313 --> 24:58.214
- Yes, I know it.
- Good. Keep it in mind.

24:59.883 --> 25:01.950
There were no records
at the sperm bank

25:01.985 --> 25:04.319
- because I didn't keep any.
- Why?

25:04.353 --> 25:06.787
Because I provided
all the spunk myself.

25:06.821 --> 25:08.288
It was a way to save money.

25:08.322 --> 25:11.223
I didn't have to pay
for donors or stroke books

25:11.257 --> 25:13.224
or tissues--
No overhead.

25:13.259 --> 25:15.660
- W-what?
- I also have good genes.

25:15.694 --> 25:17.728
I mean, there's a lot
of throat cancer

25:17.763 --> 25:20.297
and colitis in my family,
but that's about it.

25:20.331 --> 25:22.632
So my conscience was clear...

25:22.667 --> 25:26.770
Until I met you, my son.

25:26.805 --> 25:28.440
Oh my God.

25:28.474 --> 25:31.609
It was so beautiful
to meet you both today.

25:31.643 --> 25:34.711
Just to look at you--
You and your sister.

25:36.146 --> 25:39.015
I just ate a marijuana
cookie a little while ago

25:39.049 --> 25:41.083
and my hearing may be off.

25:41.117 --> 25:43.418
Did you just say
thar Rose is my sister?

25:43.453 --> 25:46.120
Yes, and she's gorgeous.

25:46.155 --> 25:48.723
She looks just like my mother.

25:49.591 --> 25:51.525
