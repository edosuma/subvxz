01:42.726 --> 01:43.727
Identify.

01:44.228 --> 01:46.480
Victor Rovner, requesting
permission to transmit.

01:46.680 --> 01:47.548
Log in.

01:58.375 --> 01:59.827
Permission granted.

02:22.900 --> 02:26.403
Excuse me a moment.
Let me catch up with you.

02:28.405 --> 02:30.908
- This is Walsh.
- Sir, we just heard from Rovner

02:31.108 --> 02:32.876
He confirmed there will be an attempt today.

02:33.076 --> 02:34.845
Did he find out who the target is?

02:35.045 --> 02:37.398
Senator David Palmer.

02:37.598 --> 02:40.492
As soon as the polls open, we'll be there

02:40.692 --> 02:43.587
Senator Palmer seems poised for victory.

02:45.089 --> 02:48.242
All right. "On this historic occasion"?

02:48.442 --> 02:51.595
Well, it is an historic occasion, sir.

02:51.795 --> 02:53.597
It's self-serving to say it.

02:54.598 --> 02:57.101
- I want to stay low-key
- Wrong.

02:57.601 --> 02:59.603
Play it up, inspire people.

03:00.604 --> 03:04.108
- Honey, what do you think?
- I agree with Patty.

03:07.111 --> 03:10.881
Okay, but not "occasion."
It sounds like we're having brunch.

03:11.081 --> 03:12.866
"On this historic day"?

03:13.317 --> 03:14.919
Deal.

03:15.119 --> 03:17.421
- You going to bed?
- How can I sleep?

03:17.621 --> 03:20.707
No, I'm going to write a few thank-you's.
Call me if you need me.

03:21.708 --> 03:23.210
Thank you, angel.

03:24.878 --> 03:26.647
You're in trouble, Dad.

03:28.048 --> 03:29.383
Really?

03:29.817 --> 03:30.767
Yeah.

03:34.788 --> 03:36.590
So...

03:36.790 --> 03:39.693
...is she still giving you
the cold shoulder?

03:41.695 --> 03:43.697
If by "she," you're referring
to your mother...

03:44.198 --> 03:48.068
...I'd appreciate it if you'd call
her by her name... Mom.

03:48.268 --> 03:51.054
- And no, she's just busy.
- She's busy a lot.

03:52.206 --> 03:55.542
And it's a school night for you,
so time for bed.

03:59.613 --> 04:02.583
I love you.

04:09.173 --> 04:11.725
I'm glad you moved back in, Daddy.

04:14.728 --> 04:16.230
Me, too, sweet.

04:16.730 --> 04:18.065
Have a good sleep.

04:23.620 --> 04:26.123
- Good night, sweet pea.
- Yeah.

04:34.131 --> 04:36.441
She still giving you a hard time?

04:36.641 --> 04:38.923
I don't know when I became the enemy.

04:39.123 --> 04:41.306
I think she blames me for you moving out.

04:41.506 --> 04:43.690
Well, I never gave her any reason to.

04:44.491 --> 04:45.492
Maybe not.

04:48.495 --> 04:51.765
But I think you let her
manipulate you, Jack.

04:51.965 --> 04:53.191
No, I don't.

04:53.391 --> 04:54.418
Let me guess.

04:54.618 --> 04:56.211
Just now she was sweetness and light, right

04:56.411 --> 04:58.005
Then she said something nasty about me?

04:58.505 --> 04:59.807
And I just busted her on it.

05:00.007 --> 05:01.141
Why you're taking this so personally?

05:01.341 --> 05:03.827
It's just that mother-teenage
daughter thing.

05:05.779 --> 05:06.780
Hey.

05:11.018 --> 05:12.019
Maybe you're right.

05:12.519 --> 05:14.171
Maybe we should talk to her right now.

05:14.371 --> 05:15.823
Tell her not to play us off each other...

05:16.023 --> 05:18.825
...and that if she's insulting you,
she's insulting me, too.

05:21.061 --> 05:22.062
Okay.

05:22.563 --> 05:23.564
Good.

05:24.064 --> 05:26.066
I really appreciate that.

05:31.572 --> 05:33.574
So, you just said that you appreciate that.

05:34.074 --> 05:35.576
Do you mean you kind of appreciate it?

05:35.776 --> 05:36.944
I really appreciate it.

05:37.144 --> 05:39.146
Do you really, really appreciate it?

05:41.148 --> 05:43.650
- How much do you appreciate it?
- Jack.

05:46.653 --> 05:47.654
Kim?

05:52.659 --> 05:53.660
Kim?

05:56.663 --> 05:57.664
Honey?

06:06.540 --> 06:07.457
Kim!

06:09.876 --> 06:11.812
She snuck out.

06:12.012 --> 06:16.016
That's it. She's grounded for
two months, no exceptions.

06:16.216 --> 06:18.535
She can forget about getting
a driver's license.

06:23.073 --> 06:25.075
- Hello?
- Hey, Teri, is Jack there?

06:25.275 --> 06:26.576
Yeah, he's right here.

06:26.776 --> 06:28.028
It's Nina.

06:28.528 --> 06:29.329
What?

06:29.529 --> 06:31.031
Hey, Nina.

06:31.365 --> 06:34.318
Now? No, I can't.

06:36.370 --> 06:37.371
Yeah

06:39.373 --> 06:42.409
Okay, fine. Get a hold of the others
and bring them in.

06:42.609 --> 06:44.411
Yeah, okay. Bye.

06:44.911 --> 06:46.763
It's Walsh. He's coming into the office.

06:46.963 --> 06:48.615
He wants everybody in as soon as possible.

06:48.815 --> 06:51.585
It's only a briefing. I should be
back within an hour.

06:51.785 --> 06:53.336
If she's not here when I get back...

06:53.536 --> 06:54.888
...we'll call all her friends...

06:55.088 --> 06:58.258
...everyone we know until we find
out where she's gone, okay?

06:58.458 --> 06:59.259
Okay.

06:59.760 --> 07:00.761
I'm sorry.

07:02.763 --> 07:04.264
I'll call you from the road.

07:17.944 --> 07:21.315
- What?
- Vincent. Jack Bauer.

07:21.515 --> 07:23.316
Are you planning on seeing Kimberly tonight?

07:23.516 --> 07:25.519
No, man, we broke up. You know that.

07:25.719 --> 07:28.121
Yeah, I just wanted to make
sure you know that.

07:28.622 --> 07:30.424
Snuck out on you, huh?

07:30.624 --> 07:33.126
- Don't screw with me, Vincent.
- Chill, man, look...

07:33.326 --> 07:35.596
I don't know where she's at.
You got my word.

07:35.796 --> 07:39.950
That's a real comfort, Vincent,
knowing that I've got your word.

07:52.162 --> 07:54.164
Why are we meeting the guys at
a furniture store?

07:54.364 --> 07:56.466
Dan works there.

07:56.666 --> 07:58.001
When are we supposed to be there?

07:58.201 --> 07:59.844
Midnight. We're late.

08:00.044 --> 08:01.533
Yeah, they'll wait.

08:01.733 --> 08:03.223
You're sure about that?

08:03.724 --> 08:07.811
Well, you told them I'm hot, right?
And you're hot, so they'll wait.

08:08.011 --> 08:10.814
Dan's a sophomore at San Diego State.

08:11.014 --> 08:12.682
Yeah, you told me that.

08:13.166 --> 08:14.751
And so is Rick.

08:14.951 --> 08:19.072
I mean, they're not just, you know,
a bunch of high-school idiots.

08:19.272 --> 08:23.543
- And your point is?
- They're men, not boys.

08:23.743 --> 08:26.179
- Good, I'm glad to hear it.
- Really?

08:26.980 --> 08:28.482
Yeah!

08:35.255 --> 08:37.057
CTU, this is Myers.

08:37.256 --> 08:39.259
This is Jack. What exactly did Walsh say?

08:39.458 --> 08:41.510
Just bring everyone in. No details.

08:41.711 --> 08:43.764
Why does this have to be tonight?

08:43.964 --> 08:45.065
Problems at home?

08:45.265 --> 08:47.601
I'm almost there. I'll see you in a few.

08:53.073 --> 08:54.841
How long is this going to take?

08:55.041 --> 08:57.477
Why? Are we interrupting your social life?

08:57.677 --> 08:59.312
At least I have one.

08:59.679 --> 09:00.680
Funny.

09:02.182 --> 09:03.350
Have you called Langley?

09:03.550 --> 09:05.035
I sure did. I called the Bureau, too.

09:05.535 --> 09:07.504
Nobody knows anything. Jack on his way?

09:07.704 --> 09:10.924
Yeah, unfortunately for us,
the mood he's in.

09:23.203 --> 09:25.322
- Hello?
- Hey.

09:25.822 --> 09:28.742
- Did you hear from Kim yet?
- No.

09:28.942 --> 09:30.344
We should try and remember..

09:30.544 --> 09:33.547
...what it was like when we were
kids, you know?

09:33.747 --> 09:35.549
It's a different world now, Jack.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.351
Yeah, I know.

09:37.551 --> 09:39.853
- Evening, Jack.
- Hey, Paul.

09:40.053 --> 09:42.472
Listen, I was talking to Denise
the other day...

09:42.672 --> 09:45.675
...and they took Nicki to a therapist
and they said it helped.

09:45.875 --> 09:46.676
Maybe we should think about that.

09:47.177 --> 09:47.978
Yeah, well, maybe.

09:48.178 --> 09:50.063
We can talk about it when I get home.

09:52.065 --> 09:53.867
Honey, I'm already here.

09:54.067 --> 09:56.584
Let me give you a call back
in a little while.

09:58.138 --> 09:58.939
Who's here?

09:59.139 --> 10:01.141
Everyone. We're just waiting for Walsh.

10:01.341 --> 10:02.642
I've activated a satellite uplink.

10:02.842 --> 10:04.227
Good.

10:04.427 --> 10:07.480
Tony, I need detailed background on
everyone on David Palmer's staff, now.

10:07.680 --> 10:08.849
Why?

10:09.049 --> 10:11.251
'Cause I think this is about him.
I want us to be prepared.

10:11.451 --> 10:13.053
Bad time to play a hunch.

10:13.253 --> 10:17.157
If it leaks out that we're screening him,
people might think it's 'cause he's black.

10:17.357 --> 10:18.959
It is because he's black.

10:19.159 --> 10:20.794
It makes him the most likely target.

10:20.994 --> 10:23.597
It might not be interpreted that
way on the outside.

10:23.797 --> 10:25.165
I don't care how it's interpreted.

10:25.365 --> 10:28.418
I just gave you an order and I'd
like you to follow it, please.

10:28.618 --> 10:29.920
Good. Thank you.

10:30.420 --> 10:33.423
Let me know as soon as Walsh gets here.
I've got to make a phone call.

11:04.471 --> 11:05.272
Hey.

11:05.472 --> 11:07.974
- How are you?
- Good.

11:13.613 --> 11:15.115
Come on, let's go in.

11:20.987 --> 11:21.988
Hi.

11:24.708 --> 11:26.393
You must be Rick.

11:26.593 --> 11:27.661
I must be.

11:27.861 --> 11:29.863
Janet said you guys like to party.

11:30.063 --> 11:31.981
As a matter of fact, yeah.

11:32.181 --> 11:34.100
As a matter of fact, me, too.

11:35.085 --> 11:36.586
Glad to hear it.

11:38.905 --> 11:41.675
Let's get this party started.

11:45.178 --> 11:46.179
Follow me.

12:12.906 --> 12:14.107
Come on!

12:14.307 --> 12:16.810
No, I'm not going up there.

12:18.311 --> 12:21.181
- You smoke?
- Yeah.

12:25.185 --> 12:28.621
Polls open in less than seven hours here
in California...

12:28.821 --> 12:30.623
Detective Castolano, please.

12:32.125 --> 12:33.560
Yeah.

12:33.760 --> 12:36.796
Senator Palmer arrived
in Los Angeles this morning...

12:36.996 --> 12:39.757
...and showed a young group of fans...

12:39.957 --> 12:42.519
Frank, it's Jack Bauer, over at CTU.

12:42.719 --> 12:45.705
This is embarrassing, but my daughter
snuck out of the house...

12:46.206 --> 12:49.025
...and she's not back yet.
If we sent her vitals over...

12:49.526 --> 12:51.328
...could you guys keep
an eye out for her?

12:51.528 --> 12:54.647
Yeah, no, I'm sure she's okay.
No, that'd be great.

12:54.847 --> 12:56.149
Thanks a lot. I owe you. Bye.

12:56.649 --> 12:58.151
Richard. Everybody's inside. Come on.

12:58.351 --> 12:59.152
Good.

12:59.652 --> 13:00.253
- Mr. Walsh.
- Hello, Nina

13:00.453 --> 13:01.988
- Shall we get started?
- Please.

13:05.358 --> 13:07.878
We believe that by the end
of the day...

13:08.078 --> 13:10.630
...an attempt will be made on
David Palmer's life.

13:12.165 --> 13:13.950
- How good's his security?
- Very good.

13:14.150 --> 13:16.836
Maybe not good enough to
handle what's coming today...

13:17.337 --> 13:19.122
...a shooter, well-funded, from overseas.

13:19.322 --> 13:21.107
What foreign power wants Palmer dead?

13:21.307 --> 13:22.742
Probably none.

13:22.942 --> 13:25.945
Most likely a domestic hate-group
hired someone from out of the country.

13:26.145 --> 13:27.247
It's harder to trace.

13:27.447 --> 13:29.899
Check the background of everyone
around Palmer.

13:30.099 --> 13:31.201
Cross it with terrorist databases.

13:31.401 --> 13:34.404
- Start now.
- Okay, we're on it. Let's go.

13:34.604 --> 13:35.438
Jack.

13:39.442 --> 13:41.444
I'll be right with you.

13:42.912 --> 13:44.297
How you doing?

13:45.782 --> 13:47.358
I can't complain.

13:47.558 --> 13:49.135
Can't or won't?

13:50.637 --> 13:52.639
Things better at home?

13:53.640 --> 13:55.442
Yeah. We're trying.

13:58.261 --> 14:01.247
What I'm about to tell you doesn't
leave this room.

14:02.248 --> 14:03.116
Fine.

14:10.640 --> 14:13.143
There may be an element inside the Agency...

14:13.343 --> 14:15.028
- ...involved with this hit.
- What?

14:15.228 --> 14:17.347
For the next 24 hours,
I want you all over this.

14:17.547 --> 14:19.683
You'll be interfacing with every
division in the region.

14:19.883 --> 14:23.703
I am the last person on this planet
you want to bring something like this to.

14:23.903 --> 14:26.373
- I don't agree.
- Richard.

14:26.573 --> 14:30.660
I built a case against three of our own
agents and busted them for taking bribes.

14:30.860 --> 14:34.948
If there's a conspiracy in the Agency to
kill Palmer, I'll never get near it.

14:35.381 --> 14:37.350
Well, you'll have to, Jack...

14:38.852 --> 14:41.855
...'cause you're the only guy
that I can trust.

14:51.197 --> 14:52.732
If Palmer gets hit...

14:52.932 --> 14:56.886
...the first African-American with
a real shot at the White House...

14:57.086 --> 14:59.339
...it'll tear this country apart.

15:09.749 --> 15:11.751
I'll look into it. I'll do the best I can.

15:11.951 --> 15:13.920
Good.

15:14.120 --> 15:17.924
George Mason is coming from Division
to give you a detailed briefing on Palmer.

15:18.124 --> 15:20.076
You think I should trust George Mason?

15:20.276 --> 15:22.228
Until we get a better handle on things...

15:22.712 --> 15:24.214
...don't trust anybody.

15:27.217 --> 15:29.035
Not even your own people.

15:31.037 --> 15:32.872
We got to find the shooter, Jack.

15:34.374 --> 15:36.492
Whatever it takes.

15:40.997 --> 15:42.298
Excuse me.

15:42.498 --> 15:45.151
How much longer till we land in Los Angeles?

15:45.351 --> 15:48.004
Let's see. It's 12:20. Just over an hour.

15:48.504 --> 15:49.505
Thank you.

16:02.569 --> 16:04.938
- You want to hit the road?
- Yeah, sure.

16:09.025 --> 16:10.827
Brooks here.

16:11.027 --> 16:13.992
Hey, Martin, how you doing?
It's the photographer.

16:17.784 --> 16:19.085
Are we still on for breakfast?

16:19.285 --> 16:22.455
Meet Secret Service in the lobby at
7:00 and they'll take care of you.

16:22.655 --> 16:24.958
Will Senator Palmer be at the breakfast?

16:25.158 --> 16:26.292
You bet.

16:26.593 --> 16:27.894
Good.

16:28.094 --> 16:30.597
- I'll see you then.
- Fly safe.

16:32.599 --> 16:36.811
Excuse me. You know David Palmer?

16:37.011 --> 16:41.224
Not yet. I am meeting him tomorrow.

16:41.424 --> 16:43.109
We have been sitting here...

16:43.610 --> 16:47.113
...this whole time making small-talk
and you never even mentioned it.

16:48.615 --> 16:51.618
I'm going to be taking a
few pictures of him.

16:52.118 --> 16:54.621
You're a photographer?

16:56.122 --> 16:59.125
Have I ever seen one of your photographs?

17:02.028 --> 17:03.329
What's next?

17:03.529 --> 17:07.032
George Mason will be here in a few
minutes and then he's going to brief me.

17:08.034 --> 17:09.035
You, not us?

17:13.373 --> 17:16.409
You can't shut me out, Jack. Not here.

17:16.608 --> 17:18.810
It's Walsh. He wants me to meet Mason alone.

17:19.011 --> 17:20.813
- Why?
- He didn't say.

17:21.814 --> 17:22.815
You're lying.

17:24.317 --> 17:27.545
Yes, I am, but you're still going
to have to trust me.

17:27.744 --> 17:30.974
One of these days you're going to
ask for too much.

17:32.475 --> 17:35.478
I'm terribly afraid that today's
going to be that day.

17:35.695 --> 17:37.781
- Yeah?
- Hi, it's me.

17:37.981 --> 17:40.867
- Did you hear anything?
- No.

17:41.868 --> 17:43.169
What's wrong?

17:43.369 --> 17:44.904
I found three joints in her desk.

17:45.104 --> 17:46.206
Terrific.

17:46.406 --> 17:48.741
I know it's not the end of the
world, but I don't like it.

17:48.941 --> 17:50.627
I don't either.

17:50.827 --> 17:52.712
Maybe you can get into her e-mail...

17:52.912 --> 17:54.597
...check her messages or something.

17:54.797 --> 17:58.368
We gave her her own password to show
that we trusted her, remember?

17:58.868 --> 17:59.869
Yeah.

18:00.870 --> 18:02.872
Honey, I...

18:03.373 --> 18:05.704
I'm so sorry that I can't
be there with you right now.

18:10.229 --> 18:11.731
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

18:15.268 --> 18:17.770
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

18:22.592 --> 18:25.094
When I got into San Diego State I
figured, "What the hell?"

18:25.294 --> 18:27.096
"Give college a try."

18:29.098 --> 18:31.100
- Do you live near the beach?
- Yeah.

18:33.102 --> 18:34.404
Do you surf?

18:34.604 --> 18:36.105
No. Surfing's way too motivated.

18:36.606 --> 18:38.975
You got to get wet, there's sharks...

18:39.175 --> 18:41.544
...you got to call everybody "dude."

18:43.046 --> 18:46.049
- Why?
- No reason.

18:46.249 --> 18:47.550
My dad surfs.

18:47.750 --> 18:48.535
Surfed.

18:48.735 --> 18:50.470
He doesn't anymore? He's too old?

18:51.788 --> 18:53.289
My father's dead.

18:55.108 --> 18:56.943
Hey, my bad.

18:58.811 --> 19:01.314
It's okay. He was this...

19:01.814 --> 19:04.617
...really great guy, and then...

19:04.817 --> 19:07.320
- ...six months ago, he..
- I'm sorry.

19:08.821 --> 19:10.323
Yeah. I'm over it.

19:11.324 --> 19:14.293
Getting over it. It's hard but I am.

19:17.380 --> 19:18.881
Hey.

19:23.569 --> 19:25.571
Mason's on his way up.

19:39.952 --> 19:42.455
- George.
- Jack. How's it going?

19:42.655 --> 19:43.956
Good to see you. Come on in.

19:45.458 --> 19:47.493
How much did Walsh tell you down there?

19:47.693 --> 19:48.761
Not much.

19:48.961 --> 19:51.964
Palmer's the target,
shooter's the real deal.

19:52.164 --> 19:53.349
That's about it.

19:53.850 --> 19:55.701
I can narrow it down
for you a bit, if you like.

19:55.901 --> 19:57.186
Please do.

19:58.771 --> 20:01.941
We think the shooter's
European, probably German...

20:02.141 --> 20:05.795
...and that he's either here
already or he's coming today.

20:05.995 --> 20:08.039
This will get you into secured
data nationwide.

20:08.239 --> 20:10.283
See if it clicks with anything
you already have.

20:10.483 --> 20:12.218
Who's the source on this?

20:12.418 --> 20:13.953
That I can't give you.

20:14.153 --> 20:17.457
- Because?
- Because I'm not authorized to.

20:18.374 --> 20:20.176
How can I cross-check the data...

20:20.376 --> 20:23.646
...if I don't know where the original
information's coming from?

20:25.148 --> 20:27.934
What do you know about Palmer's politics?

20:30.169 --> 20:32.004
You know he's no friend
to the Agency, right?

20:32.505 --> 20:35.608
And if he gets elected,
this place gets gutted.

20:35.808 --> 20:38.761
- What are you trying to say?
- I'm not saying anything.

20:38.961 --> 20:42.281
Saying do your job, and stay out of
what doesn't concern you.

20:43.282 --> 20:44.384
Fair enough.

20:44.584 --> 20:46.569
Good. Then we're done.

20:49.522 --> 20:50.840
George.

20:51.841 --> 20:53.142
I need a favor.

20:53.342 --> 20:54.844
I need you to call your boss...

20:55.094 --> 20:57.830
...and ask him to give me clearance
on the ID of this source.

20:58.030 --> 20:59.632
I thought we agreed that it
didn't matter.

20:59.832 --> 21:03.336
But I still got to call Walsh and
tell him that I did everything I could.

21:03.536 --> 21:05.438
I would like to cover my own ass.

21:05.905 --> 21:08.908
Jack, you're finally learning
how to play the game.

21:09.408 --> 21:11.285
Sure, I'll call Chappelle for you.

21:11.485 --> 21:13.362
- Use your phone?
- Please do.

21:13.562 --> 21:14.947
You want a cup of coffee?

21:15.147 --> 21:16.449
No, I'm good.

21:16.816 --> 21:18.718
Thanks.

21:26.092 --> 21:27.894
I want to hear Mason's call.

21:34.901 --> 21:39.188
At the sound of the tone,
the time will be 12:29...

21:39.388 --> 21:40.690
...and 30 seconds.

21:48.331 --> 21:50.733
At the sound of the tone, the time...

21:50.933 --> 21:53.336
Yeah, I'm talking to my boss, Jack.

21:53.536 --> 21:55.922
Right, you stupid chump.

22:00.910 --> 22:03.879
- What are you doing?
- He's screwing with us.

22:04.079 --> 22:05.131
Get me that binder.

22:05.464 --> 22:07.400
- What?
- The binder. Get me the binder

22:07.600 --> 22:09.435
At the sound of the tone...

22:11.704 --> 22:13.406
We need to talk about this?

22:25.201 --> 22:26.202
Nina?

22:40.232 --> 22:43.703
You can consider your ass
officially covered. Chappelle said no.

22:57.283 --> 22:59.118
You are out of your mind.

23:00.503 --> 23:03.506
Mason's holding something back
I need some bargaining power.

23:03.706 --> 23:05.508
How are you going to get it?

23:06.008 --> 23:07.801
Remember Phillipe Darcet?

23:08.001 --> 23:09.795
Heroin dealer, Barcelona?

23:10.296 --> 23:11.080
Yeah.

23:11.280 --> 23:14.083
Mason was the point man on his
bust last August.

23:14.283 --> 23:17.787
When they rolled up Darcet's assets,
$200,000 was missing.

23:17.987 --> 23:20.790
I always thought it fell into
Mason's pockets.

23:20.990 --> 23:22.241
Now I need proof.

23:23.743 --> 23:27.246
You're going to blackmail
a District director?

23:27.446 --> 23:29.749
I want you to check Darcet's accounts.

23:30.249 --> 23:33.986
You can access them through the
secured files. Use this.

23:34.186 --> 23:37.923
Nina, he's going to wake up in a
half an hour or less.

24:08.187 --> 24:09.805
Senator Palmer, blending intelligence...

24:10.005 --> 24:12.341
...political courage,
hard work, and luck...

24:15.378 --> 24:17.263
Damn it! Hello?

24:17.463 --> 24:20.466
I'm sorry to bother you at this hour.
My name is Alan York.

24:20.666 --> 24:24.136
I found this number in my
daughter's calendar.

24:24.336 --> 24:26.439
- Who's your daughter?
- Janet York.

24:26.639 --> 24:30.142
- Do you have a son or a...
- Daughter... Kimberly.

24:30.643 --> 24:32.945
She snuck out of the house.
Is Janet gone, too?

24:33.145 --> 24:36.449
Yes, I bet they're together. Any idea
where they might be?

24:36.716 --> 24:38.751
None. Did Janet say anything?

24:38.951 --> 24:41.587
She was gone when I came home from work.

24:41.787 --> 24:44.490
Can I give you my number in case
you hear anything?

24:44.690 --> 24:45.775
Yeah, of course.

24:49.545 --> 24:51.430
I've got Darcet's account number.

24:51.630 --> 24:52.214
Good.

24:52.598 --> 24:54.650
It's encrypted. I can't get around it.

24:55.651 --> 24:59.121
- Ask Tony to do it.
- He'll need a reason.

24:59.321 --> 25:03.542
If he thinks he's doing it for me.
Not if he's doing it for you.

25:05.544 --> 25:07.613
I'm surprised you noticed.

25:08.114 --> 25:09.615
I noticed.

25:11.083 --> 25:12.952
Well, you shouldn't have.

25:28.017 --> 25:29.018
- Tony.
- Yeah.

25:29.518 --> 25:30.936
I need you to do something for me.

25:31.136 --> 25:31.937
For you or for Jack?

25:33.939 --> 25:35.908
I need you to get into this account.

25:37.893 --> 25:40.880
What does Phillipe Darcet's
bank account have to do with Palmer?

25:41.080 --> 25:42.164
We don't know yet.

25:42.364 --> 25:44.150
We're trying to pick up a thread.

25:45.134 --> 25:46.635
That's interesting, because...

25:47.136 --> 25:48.704
...I've been trying to pick up
a thread of my own.

25:48.904 --> 25:50.456
About what?

25:50.656 --> 25:52.625
Whether you're still sleeping with Jack.

25:54.610 --> 25:56.162
Who says I ever did?

25:58.147 --> 25:59.949
What do you see in him?

26:00.149 --> 26:02.935
- He turned in his own people.
- They were dirty.

26:03.936 --> 26:06.238
And he's Mr. Clean?

26:06.438 --> 26:08.307
Yes, he is.

26:08.774 --> 26:11.844
Look, we don't have a lot of time.
Will you help me out here?

26:12.311 --> 26:13.813
Please?

26:15.815 --> 26:17.817
I'll see what I can find.

26:19.768 --> 26:21.770
I'll see what I can find!

26:33.415 --> 26:36.218
Jamey, if I give you a phone number...

26:36.418 --> 26:39.421
...could you hack in and get
all the passwords connected to it?

26:39.621 --> 26:41.581
Sure, if you have a warrant.

26:41.781 --> 26:43.742
And if I didn't have a warrant?

26:44.727 --> 26:46.028
It's important?

26:46.228 --> 26:47.730
It's very important.

26:52.434 --> 26:53.435
Go.

27:16.075 --> 27:18.861
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

27:19.061 --> 27:19.862
I got her password.

27:20.346 --> 27:21.647
What is it?

27:22.081 --> 27:23.916
"Lifesucks," one word.

27:24.116 --> 27:25.484
Perfect.

27:25.684 --> 27:29.138
So, are you going to be around this weekend?

27:29.338 --> 27:30.639
I could be.

27:32.291 --> 27:33.292
Be.

27:43.719 --> 27:46.989
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

27:55.681 --> 27:58.150
Did you ever meet Princess Di?

27:58.350 --> 27:59.151
Yeah.

27:59.351 --> 28:01.353
But I never took her picture.

28:02.688 --> 28:03.956
What was she like?

28:04.873 --> 28:06.375
She was cool.

28:10.346 --> 28:11.847
Can I...

28:14.850 --> 28:16.652
Can I see one of your photographs?

28:19.054 --> 28:21.056
- My photographs?
- Yeah.

28:22.057 --> 28:23.192
Yeah.

28:28.197 --> 28:30.699
How about this one right here?

28:39.208 --> 28:40.709
That's very beautiful.

28:43.712 --> 28:45.714
- Munich?
- Yeah.

28:54.556 --> 28:56.041
Finish the speech?

28:56.992 --> 28:58.294
Taking a break.

28:58.494 --> 29:00.446
The guys got tired of me yelling at them.

29:00.946 --> 29:02.965
Big, old, grumpy bear.

29:11.223 --> 29:12.525
How you doing?

29:12.725 --> 29:15.377
Fine, just a few dozen more to go.

29:15.577 --> 29:18.230
You don't have to do these yourself.

29:18.430 --> 29:19.932
The personal touch never hurts.

29:20.432 --> 29:21.934
- Sure doesn't.
- Yes.

29:22.134 --> 29:23.435
Yes.

29:24.937 --> 29:26.739
Sir?

29:26.939 --> 29:31.293
Phone call, Senator. It's Maureen
Kingsley from the network.

29:31.493 --> 29:33.178
Come on, Patty, it's after midnight.

29:33.378 --> 29:35.414
She says it's urgent.

29:41.170 --> 29:44.123
Maureen, this better be good.

29:44.506 --> 29:46.291
Can I get you some coffee or anything?

29:46.492 --> 29:47.359
Thank you, Patty.

29:47.826 --> 29:48.794
My response?

29:50.295 --> 29:51.597
Here's my response.

29:51.797 --> 29:54.783
You air that allegation, or anything
remotely like it...

30:00.606 --> 30:03.108
This conversation is over, Maureen.

30:11.617 --> 30:13.452
That'll be all, Patty.

30:15.771 --> 30:17.022
Sweetheart?

30:17.322 --> 30:18.991
What was it?

30:19.491 --> 30:22.528
Just more media nonsense. Not important.

30:24.763 --> 30:26.882
It didn't sound not important.

30:29.501 --> 30:32.387
Since when don't we talk about things?

31:08.941 --> 31:11.952
This is Richard Walsh.
At the tone, leave a message.

31:12.152 --> 31:15.164
Richard, it's Jack.
Call me back. It's important.

31:23.172 --> 31:25.674
I thought you wanted to get your
life back together.

31:25.874 --> 31:28.177
Make things right with your family.

31:28.377 --> 31:30.479
You think this is helping?

31:30.679 --> 31:32.681
He's got information that I need.

31:32.881 --> 31:34.183
What information?

31:36.185 --> 31:37.486
Never mind.

31:37.686 --> 31:38.988
You can't tell me, fine.

31:39.188 --> 31:42.691
But, Jack, if Tony doesn't find
anything, you could end up in jail.

31:42.891 --> 31:44.493
Probably.

31:44.693 --> 31:46.478
Then what are you doing?

31:51.884 --> 31:52.885
Jack.

31:54.386 --> 31:56.388
Answer me.

31:57.890 --> 32:01.794
Nina, you can look the other way once
and it's no big deal.

32:01.994 --> 32:05.097
It makes it easier for you to
compromise the next time...

32:05.297 --> 32:08.400
...and soon that's all you're
doing is compromising...

32:08.600 --> 32:10.903
...because that's how you think
things are done.

32:14.089 --> 32:17.593
You know those guys I blew the whistle on?
You think they were the bad guys?

32:18.093 --> 32:19.595
'Cause they weren't. They weren't bad guys.

32:19.795 --> 32:22.155
They were just like you and me.

32:22.355 --> 32:24.716
Except they compromised... once.

32:36.478 --> 32:39.231
I'll see how Tony's coming along.

32:40.032 --> 32:40.899
Thank you.

32:56.615 --> 32:58.533
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Teri Bauer.

32:58.733 --> 33:00.652
Hi, have you heard anything?

33:01.019 --> 33:04.022
Yeah, I broke into Kim's e-mail.
Janet sent her one this morning.

33:04.222 --> 33:05.857
They're meeting two guys in the Valley.

33:06.358 --> 33:07.659
Did you get an address?

33:07.859 --> 33:08.961
Yep, I'm going right now.

33:09.161 --> 33:13.532
Would you mind if I came along I'm getting
stir-crazy sitting around here.

33:13.732 --> 33:14.533
All right.

33:15.033 --> 33:17.703
I'm leaving right now. Tell me
where you live.

33:22.741 --> 33:24.043
Where are we going now?

33:24.243 --> 33:26.778
Wasn't there supposed to be
a party at Lacy's?

33:26.978 --> 33:28.280
Anybody got a phone?
I'll call.

33:28.480 --> 33:29.781
Yeah, I do.

33:34.786 --> 33:36.788
I got to go home.

33:36.988 --> 33:38.257
Why?

33:38.457 --> 33:40.296
My mother left five messages.

33:40.496 --> 33:41.760
Run home to Mommy.

33:41.960 --> 33:44.045
Her father just died, okay?

33:44.245 --> 33:46.331
Maybe her mother needs her.

33:46.531 --> 33:47.633
Your father?

33:48.367 --> 33:49.710
Shut up.

33:49.910 --> 33:51.253
Whatever.

33:52.154 --> 33:53.972
I don't want to go home.

33:54.172 --> 33:55.474
But...

33:56.708 --> 33:58.076
We'll drop you off, okay?

34:09.054 --> 34:10.554
Yeah.

34:32.327 --> 34:33.829
What's your name?

34:34.830 --> 34:36.014
Martin.

34:36.998 --> 34:38.000
I'm Mandy.

34:39.501 --> 34:41.902
Hey, maybe we can get together...

34:42.103 --> 34:44.505
...when we're in LA, or something.

34:46.007 --> 34:48.510
I'm going to be pretty busy.

34:51.513 --> 34:52.514
See you.

34:56.851 --> 34:59.021
- Yeah?
- I got into the Darcet account.

34:59.521 --> 35:00.322
Nina said you wanted it.

35:00.522 --> 35:02.524
Thank you. Send it to my screen.

35:02.724 --> 35:04.026
All right.

35:18.874 --> 35:20.375
Wake up.

35:26.681 --> 35:27.966
Sit down.

35:28.767 --> 35:30.369
Who's the source?

35:30.569 --> 35:33.055
Who tipped us on the Palmer hit?

35:36.842 --> 35:41.029
Last August when you led the
take-down of Phillipe Darcet...

35:41.229 --> 35:45.550
...all his assets were transferred to a
custodial account in Langley, Virginia.

35:45.750 --> 35:48.537
$200,000 fell out along the way.

35:48.737 --> 35:50.021
I traced that money...

35:50.522 --> 35:52.891
...to an offshore account in Aruba.

35:53.091 --> 35:56.094
I got a funny feeling about that
account, George.

35:56.294 --> 35:57.429
I think it's yours.

35:57.863 --> 35:59.931
Yeah, well, that's a lie.

36:00.899 --> 36:02.701
Good.

36:02.901 --> 36:06.838
Then you won't mind if I send
Chappelle the information.

36:12.310 --> 36:13.779
The source, George.

36:18.283 --> 36:20.752
You have no idea what you're getting
yourself into here.

36:20.952 --> 36:22.954
Why don't you explain it to me?

36:24.790 --> 36:26.608
You've got five seconds.

36:30.345 --> 36:31.246
Wait.

36:38.386 --> 36:40.038
There's your source.

36:48.046 --> 36:49.631
Thanks for your help, George.

36:49.831 --> 36:52.334
You'll live to regret this, Bauer.

36:52.534 --> 36:53.835
I promise you that.

37:09.184 --> 37:10.519
Excuse me.

37:11.019 --> 37:13.071
Ma'am, we're about to land.
If you could please...

38:20.222 --> 38:21.890
Please remain in your seat.

38:22.090 --> 38:23.174
I lost my wallet.

39:22.150 --> 39:24.152
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

39:24.653 --> 39:25.654
Turn left at the light.

39:26.154 --> 39:26.772
What?

39:26.972 --> 39:28.723
I'm in a car with Alan York.

39:28.923 --> 39:31.426
He's the father of one
of Kimberly's friends.

39:31.626 --> 39:32.310
What are you talking about?

39:32.510 --> 39:35.013
Kim got an e-mail this
morning from Janet York...

39:35.213 --> 39:36.815
...and they might be out together.

39:37.015 --> 39:38.083
Where?

39:38.283 --> 39:41.086
I don't know yet. They were
meeting some guys in the Valley.

39:41.286 --> 39:45.040
Wait a second. You're going to the
Valley with this guy, Alan York?

39:45.540 --> 39:47.225
What are you going to do
if she's not there?

39:47.425 --> 39:51.930
Well, we haven't thought that far
ahead yet. I'll call.

39:53.498 --> 39:54.482
Hello?

39:54.983 --> 39:56.484
Teri?

40:08.296 --> 40:10.098
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:10.298 --> 40:12.801
Would you do me a favor? Could
you cover for me?

40:13.001 --> 40:13.585
Sure.

40:13.785 --> 40:15.787
Forward all my calls to my cell phone.

40:15.987 --> 40:18.039
I'll be back as soon as I can.

40:19.557 --> 40:20.658
Jack.

40:20.858 --> 40:21.960
What?

40:23.528 --> 40:26.031
A 747 just blew up over the
Mojave desert.

40:26.531 --> 40:29.100
Preliminary reports make it sound like
it was a bomb.

40:32.220 --> 40:35.724
The passenger list. Get me Walsh
on the phone now.

40:50.555 --> 40:51.539
Janet?

41:01.883 --> 41:03.718
Turn here. I live on 10th.

41:06.504 --> 41:09.007
- Dan, I just told you...
- Why don't you just relax?

41:13.194 --> 41:15.196
Can you please tell him that he
missed the turn?

41:15.396 --> 41:17.999
You heard him. Relax.

41:18.199 --> 41:20.702
The night's just getting started.
