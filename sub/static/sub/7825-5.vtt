Here's good news.

00:52.900 --> 00:54.500
According to this
eye-catching article

00:54.570 --> 00:57.110
S.A.T. Scores are declining
at a slower rate.

00:57.170 --> 00:59.840
Dad, I think this paper
is a flimsy hodge-podge

00:59.910 --> 01:02.440
of pie graphs, factoids
and Larry King.

01:02.510 --> 01:04.650
Hey, this is the only paper
in America

01:04.709 --> 01:06.550
that's not afraid
to tell the truth--

01:06.610 --> 01:08.150
that everything is just fine.

01:08.210 --> 01:10.710
"to me bestest bud Milhouse.

01:10.780 --> 01:12.580
Happy birthday, Bart."

01:12.650 --> 01:14.160
Bart,
that's so sweet.

01:14.220 --> 01:16.090
May I see the card?

"Hey there 10 year-old.
I couldn't afford
to get you a new drum..."

01:23.360 --> 01:24.170
Eww.

01:24.800 --> 01:25.770
<i>Come on.</i>

Open it! Open it!

01:26.970 --> 01:28.670
Uh... maybe
a little later, Bart.

01:28.730 --> 01:30.730
Aw Milhouse, just 'cause
your Mom didn't let you
have a party

01:30.800 --> 01:32.060
doesn't mean you
can't get a present.

01:32.140 --> 01:34.910
We had a lovely time
on Saturday, Milhouse.

01:34.970 --> 01:36.400
I liked
the balloons.

01:36.480 --> 01:38.280
I liked the party hats.

01:38.340 --> 01:39.340
What are you girls
talking about?

01:39.410 --> 01:40.650
Nothing.

They're official
Krusty the clown

01:49.790 --> 01:51.730
I'll keep one
and you keep one.

01:51.790 --> 01:52.560
Now whenever you want
to talk to me

01:52.620 --> 01:54.050
just call me on the phone

01:54.130 --> 01:56.400
and tell me to turn on
my walkie-talkie.

01:56.460 --> 01:59.400
Milhouse, I'd like to express my
appreciation for Saturday--

01:59.470 --> 02:02.740
jelly bean baskets,
personalized noisemakers--

02:02.800 --> 02:06.470
but the little touches
are what made it enduring.

02:06.540 --> 02:08.139
What's he talking about?

02:08.210 --> 02:09.740
Hey, look at that dog.

02:09.810 --> 02:11.280
Isn't that something?

02:11.340 --> 02:14.410
Wow! Brown.

02:14.480 --> 02:17.350
Whoa! Springfield Elementary,

02:17.420 --> 02:19.250
And by the way,
I'd like to say thanks

to birthday boy Milhouse

02:21.920 --> 02:23.790

02:23.860 --> 02:25.360
on Saturday!

02:25.420 --> 02:27.190
( <i>cheering )</i>

02:27.260 --> 02:30.530
Milhouse, I think I left
my pants on your roof.

02:30.600 --> 02:31.870
You <i>did have a party.</i>

02:31.930 --> 02:33.400
You didn't invite me.

02:33.470 --> 02:35.500
And I thought
we were best friends.

02:35.570 --> 02:37.110
Sorry, Bart.

02:38.940 --> 02:40.340
Bye, little dudes.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.080
Don't learn anything
I wouldn't learn.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.200
Ah, Monday morning.

02:46.280 --> 02:47.620
Time to pay

02:47.680 --> 02:49.780

of debauchery

02:49.850 --> 02:51.120
you hung-over drones.

02:51.180 --> 02:52.510
T.G.I.M., Sir.

02:52.580 --> 02:54.850
What did you do
this weekend, Smithers?

02:54.920 --> 02:56.790
Well, I caught up
on my laundry

02:56.860 --> 02:58.860
wrote a letter
to my mother.

02:58.920 --> 03:01.050
Here's the kicker:
I took Hercules out
to be clipped.

03:01.130 --> 03:02.800
Who the devil is Hercules?

03:02.860 --> 03:04.130
He's my Yorkshire Terrier, Sir.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.230
He's kind of tiny, so..

03:05.300 --> 03:06.730
You know, it's a joke.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.470
Here's a picture of Hurky.

03:08.530 --> 03:10.260
Wheww.

03:10.340 --> 03:13.340
Well, Smithers,
don't you know how
to paint the town red.

03:13.410 --> 03:15.180
May I ask about <i>your weekend?</i>

03:15.240 --> 03:16.880
A bit overly familiar,
but I'll allow it.

03:16.940 --> 03:19.200
I took in a movie.

03:19.280 --> 03:22.450
An appalling little piece
of filth. It's 'leading lady'
was a blonde harlot

03:22.510 --> 03:25.440
who spent half the film
strolling around naked as a
Jaybird.

03:25.520 --> 03:26.820
( gasps )
No, just give
the great unwashed

03:26.890 --> 03:29.890
a pair of oversized breasts
and a happy ending

03:29.960 --> 03:31.290
and they'll oink
for more every time.

03:31.360 --> 03:32.990
What a movie!

03:33.060 --> 03:35.200
And that blond cutie--
does she have assets!
( oinks )

03:35.260 --> 03:36.130

03:36.200 --> 03:37.100
Heh-heh-heh!

03:37.160 --> 03:39.560

03:39.630 --> 03:40.370

Apu, hey.

04:09.030 --> 04:11.630
Got a bad case
of the munchies, man.

04:11.700 --> 04:13.600
Time for a heat lamp dog.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.339
Otto, did you know there's
a child inside your bus?

04:16.399 --> 04:17.959
<i>Woah, good thing you warned me.</i>

04:18.019 --> 04:19.320

to Mexico.

04:25.960 --> 04:28.700
Call me old-fashioned,
but movies were sexier

when the actors kept
their clothes on.

04:31.130 --> 04:33.530
Vilma Banky could do more
for me with one raised eyebrow

Uh, Homer Simpson, Sir.

Simpson, eh?

04:44.280 --> 04:45.680

Okay, okay. Don't panic.

Otto-man.

05:19.980 --> 05:21.490
Sure, you will.

05:21.550 --> 05:23.990
Once, my old lady ran off
and married my brother.

05:24.050 --> 05:28.850
Well, it hurt, but here it is
a month later, and I'm sleeping
on their couch.

Mr. Burns?

Oh, hello, Kent.

Right now, skilled nuclear

Mr. Burns, people are calling
this a meltdown.</i>

<i>Burns:
Oh, meltdown. That's one of

06:32.450 --> 06:35.750
<i>We prefer to call it an

06:35.820 --> 06:37.850
Homey, please, be all right.

06:37.930 --> 06:38.860
Got to think!

06:38.930 --> 06:40.530
Okay, somewhere there's a thingy

06:40.600 --> 06:42.770
that tells you
how to work this stuff.

06:42.830 --> 06:44.100
The, um... manual!

06:44.170 --> 06:45.540
The manual, right.

06:45.600 --> 06:46.600
Aha!

06:46.670 --> 06:47.670
( <i>screaming )</i>

06:47.740 --> 06:50.010

D-ohhh! Get to the point, man.

06:58.610 --> 07:00.310
Ooh, what's this?

07:00.380 --> 07:02.890
D-ohh! Who'd have thought
a nuclear reactor

07:02.950 --> 07:04.460
would be so complicated?

07:04.520 --> 07:06.360

07:06.420 --> 07:09.460
Sir, there may never be

I love you, sir.

Oh, hot dog.

07:10.930 --> 07:13.230
Thank you for making

07:14.560 --> 07:17.290
Looks like this is the end.

07:17.370 --> 07:18.640
That's all right.

07:18.700 --> 07:20.770
I couldn't have led
a richer life.

<i>After the meltdown,
we can expect roving bands...</i>

07:23.110 --> 07:24.580

07:32.710 --> 07:35.580
When they look up "stupid"
in a dictionary

07:35.650 --> 07:37.520
there will be a picture of me.

if you spare this town

07:47.700 --> 07:50.770
from becoming a smoking hole
in the ground

07:50.830 --> 07:53.030
I'll try
to be a better Christian.

07:53.100 --> 07:55.440
I don't know what I can do.

07:55.500 --> 07:59.130
Um... oh, the next time
there's a canned food drive

07:59.210 --> 08:01.780
I'll give the poor something
they'd actually like

08:01.840 --> 08:04.340
instead of old lima beans
and pumpkin mix.

09:19.320 --> 09:20.420
...moe.

<i>Have a nice day.</i>

09:30.670 --> 09:32.040
Whew.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.610
( <i>cheering )</i>

09:44.350 --> 09:45.550
Will I ever
see you again?

09:45.610 --> 09:46.610
Sure, baby.

09:46.680 --> 09:48.350
Next meltdown. Heh.

Burns:
Yes, we've isolated the problem.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.840
Wouldn't you know-- false alarm.

10:04.900 --> 10:07.510
It seems a single wayward crow

10:07.570 --> 10:09.340
- flew into our
warning system.
- Very Good.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.370
Well Sir, your point
about nuclear hysteria

10:11.440 --> 10:12.380
is well-taken.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.980
This reporter promises

10:14.040 --> 10:16.070
to be more trusting,
and less vigilant in the future.

10:16.140 --> 10:17.240
Excellent.

10:17.310 --> 10:18.680
Well, ta.

10:18.750 --> 10:21.620
Smithers, I can still
sell them snake oil.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.640
Now, bring me
a wine spritzer

10:23.720 --> 10:26.160
and don't be stingy
with the <i>vino.</i>

10:26.220 --> 10:27.560
Yes, Sir.

10:27.620 --> 10:28.950
So, Smithers

10:29.020 --> 10:32.150
it seems you've underestimated
one Homer Simpson

10:32.230 --> 10:35.300
our next
Employee of the Month.
( glass crashing )

10:37.700 --> 10:39.600
Bart:
Milhouse,
a little salt?

10:39.670 --> 10:40.440
Sure.

10:42.170 --> 10:43.110
Ohh!

10:43.170 --> 10:44.180
Ha-ha-ha.

10:44.240 --> 10:45.210
Now we're even
for your party.

10:45.270 --> 10:46.500
Come on,
let's go play.

10:46.580 --> 10:50.880
Bart, my Mom won't let me
be your friend anymore.

10:50.950 --> 10:52.520
That's why you
couldn't come to the party.

10:52.580 --> 10:54.250
What's she got against me?

10:54.320 --> 10:56.250
She says you're a bad influence.

10:56.320 --> 10:58.020
Bad influence, my butt!

10:58.090 --> 11:00.190
How many times have I told you?
Never listen to your mother.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.730
But Bart, she threatened
to cut off my allowance.

11:02.790 --> 11:03.590
Whatever
she's paying you

11:03.660 --> 11:04.460
I'll double it.

11:04.530 --> 11:07.100
I'm really sorry, Bart.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.700
( <i>groaning )</i>

11:08.760 --> 11:11.390
Sir, about Employee of the
Month. If you'll recall

11:11.470 --> 11:13.500
I'm the one who put
a five-percent ceiling

11:13.570 --> 11:14.910
on the Keogh Plan which saved
this company..

11:14.970 --> 11:17.140
Smithers, you bean counter,
give it up.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.680
Simpson's my man.

11:18.740 --> 11:19.910
( <i>slurps loudly )</i>

11:19.980 --> 11:21.750
Hey, way to save
our lives.

11:21.810 --> 11:23.210
Yeah,
we owe you one.

11:23.280 --> 11:24.680
Well, you know, boys

11:24.750 --> 11:27.490
a nuclear reactor
is a lot like a woman--

11:27.550 --> 11:31.260
you just read the manual
and press the right button.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.460
( <i>slurps loudly )</i>

11:33.520 --> 11:34.430
Simpson?

11:34.490 --> 11:35.260
Monty Burns.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.550
Come with me.

11:36.630 --> 11:38.960
( <i>all chanting: )
Homer! Homer! Homer!...</i>

11:39.030 --> 11:41.630
Now, now... that will do.

11:41.700 --> 11:45.170
Homer, for your bravery
and skill

11:45.230 --> 11:46.460
we award you

11:56.710 --> 11:57.750
Ahh!

11:57.810 --> 11:58.740
Hah!

11:58.810 --> 12:01.080
And to ensure your immortality

12:01.150 --> 12:03.250
your heroic visage
will be added

12:03.320 --> 12:05.260
to our wall of fame.

12:05.320 --> 12:06.890
Oh, and what's this?

12:06.960 --> 12:11.230
A congratulatory phone call
from Earvin "Magic" Johnson?

12:11.290 --> 12:12.550
( <i>gasps )</i>

12:12.630 --> 12:13.730
Magic Johnson?!

12:13.800 --> 12:14.930
Yello.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.570
Is this really
Homer Simpson?

12:16.630 --> 12:17.870
Yeah.

12:17.930 --> 12:20.160
Wow. Homer, I just used
our last time out

12:20.240 --> 12:22.340
to call and congratulate you

12:22.400 --> 12:23.930
<i>on averting that
nuclear holocaust.</i>

12:24.010 --> 12:25.580
Well, thank you.

12:25.640 --> 12:28.280
Magic, if you play on that
ankle, you'll be in
incredible pain.

12:28.340 --> 12:29.440
I don't care.

12:29.510 --> 12:32.350
Magic, what if people think
a guy's a hero

12:32.410 --> 12:34.480
<i>but he was really just lucky?</i>

12:34.550 --> 12:38.460
Don't worry. Sooner or later,
people like that are exposed
as the frauds they are.

12:38.520 --> 12:41.160
Thanks, Magic.

in my very own home.

Look, I get enough admiration
and respect at work.

I don't need it
here at home.

your ham, Homey?

it's like ashes in my mouth.

It's actually more
of a honey glaze.

Maybe you ate a clove.

14:04.410 --> 14:06.380
What's <i>your problem, boy?</i>

14:06.440 --> 14:08.380
I had a fight
with Milhouse.

Ah, Simpson,
there's someone

15:01.260 --> 15:03.860
I want you to meet--
Aristotle Ametdopolous

15:03.930 --> 15:06.670
owner of the Shelbyville
nuclear power facility.

15:08.470 --> 15:10.270
Huh? What?

15:10.340 --> 15:12.880
It seems Ari's been having
terrible worker problems
at Shelbyville.

15:12.940 --> 15:14.710
They've lost
their zest for work.

15:14.780 --> 15:17.310
You must help them find their
<i>eanae-eharatou-nah-duleve.</i>

- Their <i>eanae
haratou doolawhat?
- Yes.</i>

15:19.150 --> 15:21.320
We want you to give them
a pep talk

15:21.380 --> 15:24.080
that turns them
from donut-eating goof-offs

15:24.150 --> 15:25.490
into a pack of
Homer Simpsons.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.450
I really can't
tell them anything.

15:27.520 --> 15:30.060
Oh, cut the false modesty!
It's getting tiresome.

15:30.120 --> 15:33.850
Besides, it's your duty.
Employee of the Month
isn't all ham and plaques.

15:33.930 --> 15:36.200
( <i>Smithers panting )</i>

15:36.260 --> 15:37.520
Well, Smithers.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.800
How kind of you
to pay us a visit.

15:39.870 --> 15:41.140
Couldn't help it, Sir.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.600
The parking here is terrible.

15:42.670 --> 15:43.270

15:43.340 --> 15:44.710
This man has no love

Be gone from my sight.

15:49.180 --> 15:50.750
That one's
always been a problem.

15:56.850 --> 15:57.860
Nah.

15:57.920 --> 15:58.890
Nah.

15:58.950 --> 16:00.180
Ah!

16:00.260 --> 16:02.530
I've won second prize
in a beauty contest.

16:02.590 --> 16:03.590
Collect ten bucks.

16:03.660 --> 16:05.660
Ha, ha!
You're losing.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.000
Bart, don't feed
your sister

16:10.500 --> 16:12.470
Don't worry Mom.
There's tons of these things.

16:12.530 --> 16:14.700
I think that game
is too old for her.

16:14.770 --> 16:16.270
Why don't you go
play with Milhouse?

16:16.340 --> 16:17.840
I don't want to
play with Milhouse.

16:17.910 --> 16:19.510
You mean you still haven't
made up with him?

16:19.570 --> 16:21.770
It's his mom. She says
I'm a bad influence.

16:21.840 --> 16:24.640
C'mon Maggie, let's go
throw rocks at that
hornets' nest.

16:24.710 --> 16:26.370
( <i>growls )</i>

16:28.880 --> 16:31.780
Mrs. Van Houten,
I'm Bart's mother.

16:31.850 --> 16:34.250
We met in the
Emergency Room when
the boys drank paint.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.990
I remember.
Please come in.

16:36.060 --> 16:37.130
Marge, I'm sorry

16:37.190 --> 16:39.130
but I think
it would be better

16:39.190 --> 16:41.260
if Milhouse
didn't see your son.

16:41.330 --> 16:44.300
Look, I know Bart
can be a handful

16:44.370 --> 16:47.600
but I also know
what he's like inside.

16:47.670 --> 16:49.140
He's got a spark.

16:49.200 --> 16:50.830
It's not a bad thing.

16:50.910 --> 16:53.110
Of course,
it makes him do bad things.

16:53.170 --> 16:54.900
Well, Marge, the other day

16:54.980 --> 16:57.250
Milhouse told me
my meat loaf sucks.

16:57.310 --> 17:00.180
He must have gotten that
from your little boy

17:00.250 --> 17:03.420
because they certainly
don't say that word on TV.

17:03.480 --> 17:06.280
Well, I can't defend
everything he does

17:06.349 --> 17:07.609
but let's face it.

17:07.690 --> 17:10.460
All Bart and Milhouse have
is each other.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.300
They're too young
for girls

17:12.359 --> 17:13.930
and they're a popular target
for bullies

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
and in the Christmas Pageant,
they're always sheep.

17:17.069 --> 17:20.670
Please, <i>please,
let them be friends.</i>

17:25.940 --> 17:28.410
( <i>sighing: )
I'll think about it, Marge.</i>

17:30.010 --> 17:32.250
So the next time
somebody tells you

17:32.310 --> 17:34.540
carny folk are good,
honest people,

17:34.620 --> 17:36.920
you can spit
in their faces for me.

17:36.990 --> 17:39.490
I will, Mr. Gumble.
But if you'll excuse me

17:39.550 --> 17:42.120
I'm profiling my Dad
for the school paper.

17:42.190 --> 17:43.660
I thought it'd be neat
to follow him around
for a day

17:43.730 --> 17:45.560
to see what makes him tick.

17:45.630 --> 17:46.800
Aw, that's sweet.

17:46.860 --> 17:48.870
I used to follow my Dad
to a lot of bars too.

17:48.930 --> 17:50.430

Here you go.
One beer, one chocolate milk.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.670
Excuse me,
I have the chocolate milk.

17:54.740 --> 17:55.840
Oh.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.160
( <i>groans )</i>

17:57.240 --> 17:58.640
What's the matter,
Homer?

17:58.710 --> 18:00.310
The depressing effects
of alcohol

18:00.380 --> 18:02.180
usually don't kick in
till closing time.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.700
He's just
a little nervous.

18:03.780 --> 18:07.120
He has to give a speech tomorrow
on how to keep cool in a crisis.

18:07.180 --> 18:08.590
What am I gonna do?!
What am I gonna do?!

18:08.650 --> 18:09.920
Barney:
I had to give a speech once.

18:09.980 --> 18:12.710
I was pretty nervous,
so I used a little trick.

18:12.790 --> 18:15.830
I pictured everyone
in their underwear--

18:15.890 --> 18:19.060
the judge, the jury, my lawyer--
everybody.

18:19.130 --> 18:19.900
Did it work?

18:19.960 --> 18:21.700
I'm a free man, ain't I?

18:21.760 --> 18:23.260
Milhouse to Bart.

18:23.330 --> 18:25.300
Do you want
to come over and play?

18:25.370 --> 18:27.540
Really?
We can be friends again?

18:27.600 --> 18:29.210
Did your mom die?

18:29.270 --> 18:30.840
Uh... I don't think so.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.010
Well, who cares?

18:32.070 --> 18:33.430
Milhouse, I'll be right there.

18:33.510 --> 18:34.710
Sorry, Maggie.
Game's over.

18:36.680 --> 18:37.980
Hey, mom!

18:38.050 --> 18:39.650
I'm friends
with Milhouse again.

18:39.710 --> 18:42.740
Well I knew his mother
would come to her senses.

18:42.820 --> 18:45.260
Thanks for sticking up
for me.

18:45.320 --> 18:46.420
What makes you think
I did it?

18:46.490 --> 18:47.390
Who else would?

18:49.760 --> 18:51.060
Aw...

18:51.130 --> 18:52.230
You be good.

18:52.290 --> 18:53.350
I will.

18:57.530 --> 18:59.100
( gun cocks repeatedly )

19:00.500 --> 19:03.440
As I look out into this sea
of smiling faces

19:03.500 --> 19:06.730
I am filled with a sense
of loathing and revulsion.

19:06.810 --> 19:08.110
You are not workers.

19:08.180 --> 19:09.710
You are a pack

19:09.780 --> 19:12.080
of mangy, cud-chewing,
ugly goats.

19:12.150 --> 19:14.150
Well, you're in for a treat.

19:14.220 --> 19:16.220
We have with us today
a real man.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.980
Behold the glory
that is Homer Simpson.

19:19.050 --> 19:19.780
( <i>cheers )</i>

19:22.220 --> 19:23.280
( <i>clears throat )</i>

19:23.360 --> 19:24.230
Uh...

19:24.290 --> 19:26.860
"Ladies and...

19:26.930 --> 19:28.070
gentlemen."

19:30.030 --> 19:34.300
Just picture them
in their underwear...

19:37.640 --> 19:39.080
Whew!

19:39.140 --> 19:41.140
Ahh!

19:41.210 --> 19:45.620
( <i>voice cracking: )
"Grace under pressure...
is no..."</i>

19:45.680 --> 19:48.290
<i>Three minutes to meltdown.</i>

19:48.350 --> 19:49.290
( <i>screaming )</i>

19:50.650 --> 19:53.090
Whew! Saved by the bell.

19:53.150 --> 19:56.120
15 seconds to core meltdown.

19:56.190 --> 19:58.060
Just do what
you did before.

19:58.130 --> 19:59.360
All right.

20:01.500 --> 20:04.170
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe

20:04.230 --> 20:06.600
catch a tiger by the toe

20:06.670 --> 20:07.970
if he hollers let him go

20:08.040 --> 20:11.280
eeny, meeny, miny... moe.

20:11.340 --> 20:13.810
Crisis has been averted.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.180
Everything is super.

20:17.450 --> 20:20.050
Thank you, Homer,
for saving my plant

20:20.110 --> 20:21.980
with that idiotic rhyming!

20:22.050 --> 20:24.620
Do you even know
what button you pushed?!

20:24.690 --> 20:26.660
Sure-- moe.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.660
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.280
Is Homer a hero?

20:30.360 --> 20:32.130
The answer is no.

20:32.190 --> 20:35.720
I'm Kent Brockman
and that was "My Two Cents."

20:35.800 --> 20:38.000
Now, back to Scott Christian
with "Laugh and a Half."

20:38.070 --> 20:39.170
Thanks, Kent.

20:39.230 --> 20:41.460
There was more dumb luck
in the news today

20:41.540 --> 20:44.370
when our own Police Chief
Wiggum foiled a bank holdup

20:44.440 --> 20:45.740
without even trying.

20:45.810 --> 20:48.880
It seems the chief
had gone to the bank

20:48.940 --> 20:50.740
to cash in his penny jar.

20:50.810 --> 20:52.380
...48, 49, 50.

20:52.450 --> 20:53.550
What the..?

20:53.610 --> 20:54.610
Ooh!

20:54.680 --> 20:55.740
Good work, Chief.

20:55.820 --> 20:57.290
Just doing my job.

20:57.350 --> 21:01.590
Yes, it seems the chief pulled
a Homer Simpson of his own.

21:01.660 --> 21:03.830
( <i>men laughing )</i>

21:03.890 --> 21:05.460
Whoa!

21:05.530 --> 21:07.960
Huh?

21:08.030 --> 21:08.530
A pretzel?

21:09.800 --> 21:12.740
Wow! Looks like
I pulled a Homer.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.200
<i>Chick Hearn:
The Lakers have the ball.</i>

21:14.270 --> 21:16.440
<i>Magic Johnson coming down the
floor on a fast break.</i>

21:16.500 --> 21:18.370
<i>Magic stops.
His feet slip out
from under him!</i>

21:18.440 --> 21:21.010
<i>The ball flies out
of his hands, hits the
referee in the head</i>

21:21.080 --> 21:22.610
<i>goes in the basket!</i>

21:22.680 --> 21:23.850
It's a three-point play!

21:23.910 --> 21:24.980
The Lakers win!

21:25.050 --> 21:26.580
Looks like I pulled a Homer.

21:30.180 --> 21:31.650
Lisa:
Our Dad!

21:31.720 --> 21:33.890
Now he belongs to the ages.
