WEBVTT

00:02.670 --> 00:05.525
I'm an American._
My parents were American.

00:05.570 --> 00:07.060
My children are American.

00:07.100 --> 00:11.730
And in 2007, you were a
translator in Afghanistan?

00:11.770 --> 00:13.328
Yes, during
the Marja offensive.

00:13.380 --> 00:15.473
I worked
for a military contractor.

00:15.510 --> 00:17.808
And it was after this offensive
that you were arrested?

00:17.850 --> 00:19.613
Objection.

00:19.650 --> 00:21.777
This testimony may infringe
on the Classified Information

00:21.820 --> 00:23.640
Procedures Act...
Your Honor,
the government is

00:23.690 --> 00:25.544
denying this arrest
even took place.

00:25.590 --> 00:28.787
How can it be divulging a state
secret if it never happened?

00:28.820 --> 00:30.219
Yes, Counselor, in a day

00:30.260 --> 00:32.228
bursting with catch-22s,
this one seems

00:32.260 --> 00:34.228
particularly egregious.
Overruled.

00:34.260 --> 00:36.296
You may answer.

00:36.330 --> 00:39.060
The day after the offensive,
four men showed up in my camp.

00:39.100 --> 00:40.294
(door opening)

00:40.340 --> 00:43.605
I was hooded, placed in a van,
and taken to Camp Whitcomb.

00:43.640 --> 00:46.074
I beg your pardon, Your Honor.

00:46.110 --> 00:47.702
I'm AUSA Glenn Childs,
and I ask leave

00:47.740 --> 00:49.401
of court to join my co-counsel
on the defense.

00:49.450 --> 00:50.769
JUDGE:
My goodness, I thought you Feds

00:50.810 --> 00:52.209
were going through some sort
of budget crunch,

00:52.250 --> 00:53.342
and I get two of you.

00:53.380 --> 00:55.439
I'm merely here to supervise.

00:55.480 --> 00:57.186
Mr. Marwat is suing us
for $6 million

00:57.220 --> 00:58.778
for a torture
that never happened.

00:58.820 --> 01:00.617
We take this very seriously.

01:00.660 --> 01:02.685
Well, pull up a chair.
The fun's just beginning,

01:02.730 --> 01:04.379
Supervisor.
Ms. Lockhart.

01:04.430 --> 01:05.522
DIANE:
And what happened

01:05.560 --> 01:08.222
at Camp Whitcomb, Danny?
Well,

01:08.260 --> 01:10.490
over the next six months,

01:10.530 --> 01:12.634
I was...

01:12.670 --> 01:16.128
forced into stress positions,

01:16.170 --> 01:19.799
punched, kicked and,
um, water boarded.

01:19.840 --> 01:22.206
DIANE:
Why? What did they want to know?

01:22.250 --> 01:23.569
IfI had ever met

01:23.610 --> 01:24.804
Satar Yusuf-Khel,

01:24.850 --> 01:27.148
_ a tribal leader
With connections to al-Qaeda.

01:27.180 --> 01:28.545
And had you?
Ever met him?

01:28.580 --> 01:31.413
No, and I told them that,
but they didn't believe me.

01:31.450 --> 01:32.656
(laughs)

01:32.690 --> 01:34.578
They didn't even believe
I was an American.

01:34.620 --> 01:36.326
And why are you suing now?

01:36.360 --> 01:38.282
My government tortured me.

01:38.330 --> 01:40.651
They won't even acknowledge
that they did this to me.

01:40.700 --> 01:43.168
I don't want this
to happen to anyone else.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.758
This isn't about the money.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.199
GLENN:
Good.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.662
Then let's all go home.

01:47.700 --> 01:50.134
Mr. Childs, let's hold the
editorializing, please.

01:50.170 --> 01:51.569
DIANE:
Nothing further, Your Honor.

01:51.610 --> 01:52.838
Mr. Childs, Mr. Zschau?

01:52.880 --> 01:54.575
No questions, Your Honor.

01:54.610 --> 01:57.147
But we ask that the case
be dismissed with prejudice.

01:57.180 --> 01:58.738
On what grounds?
GLENN:
Danny's attorneys have not

01:58.780 --> 02:00.213
intro_duced_
corroborating eVIdence

02:00.250 --> 02:02.241
that he was even
ever at Camp Whitcomb.

02:02.290 --> 02:04.315
Because the government
has rejected every request

02:04.350 --> 02:07.558
for access to their secret court
proceedings Into Danny's arrest.

02:07.590 --> 02:08.784
But I don't understand why

02:08.820 --> 02:11.618
the evidentiary bar
must now be lowered.

02:13.760 --> 02:16.558
It's just belt tightening.
It's not punitive.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.261
We're reviewing all
of my predecessor's

02:18.300 --> 02:19.938
long-term investigations.

02:19.970 --> 02:21.437
If it's not about drugs

02:21.470 --> 02:23.301
or homeland security,
we're cutting them.

02:23.340 --> 02:24.807
Sorry.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.478
DANA:
Well, should we just

02:26.510 --> 02:28.535
skip the preliminaries
and get right to the pass?

02:28.580 --> 02:30.172
(laughter)

02:30.210 --> 02:32.246
Ah, Dana, Dana, Dana,
is it really your last day?

02:32.280 --> 02:33.212
Tomorrow.

02:33.250 --> 02:35.377
Although, I could go home early
if you want.

02:35.420 --> 02:36.785
And miss the pleasure
of your company?

02:36.820 --> 02:39.186
My question is, why

02:39.220 --> 02:40.414
are you here arguing

02:40.460 --> 02:41.757
an investigation
that you're gonna

02:41.790 --> 02:42.882
have nothing
to do with?

02:42.930 --> 02:44.227
Pride of authorship.

02:44.260 --> 02:45.887
I spent two years
on it with Matan,

02:45.930 --> 02:47.420
and we're finally
getting somewhere.

02:47.460 --> 02:48.893
It's an investigation
into your wife's law firm.

02:48.930 --> 02:50.227
Actually, Mr. Agos,

02:50.270 --> 02:51.419
it's a RICO investigation

02:51.470 --> 02:52.789
into corrupt defense

02:52.840 --> 02:53.966
lawyer practices.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.503
Sounds like my wife's firm.
(laughter)

02:56.540 --> 02:58.861
We had a tip earlier this year
from a walk-in--

02:58.910 --> 03:01.629
a private investigator
named Blake Calamar.

03:01.680 --> 03:03.773
He said that one of
the partners at Lockhart/Gardner

03:03.810 --> 03:04.902
had a gambling problem.

03:04.950 --> 03:07.271
He took $45,000
from a client's account

03:07.320 --> 03:08.742
to pay off a bad bet.

03:08.780 --> 03:09.781
Which partner?

03:09.820 --> 03:10.809
Will Gardner.

03:13.260 --> 03:16.525
Will Gardner took $45,000
from a client's account?

03:16.560 --> 03:18.687
Well, he intended to put it back
after a long weekend,

03:18.730 --> 03:19.719
but it was discovered missing.

03:19.760 --> 03:22.228
This Blake Calamar was tasked
with covering it up.

03:22.270 --> 03:24.397
How long ago was this?

03:24.430 --> 03:26.864
15 years.

03:26.900 --> 03:28.538
It's not our jurisdiction.

03:28.570 --> 03:31.334
Correct. It was at his first
law firm in Baltimore, but

03:31.370 --> 03:32.530
we believe that it points

03:32.580 --> 03:34.377
to a pattern of abuse
at Lockhart/Gardner.

03:34.410 --> 03:36.799
Wow. Well, uh,

03:36.850 --> 03:38.249
I need

03:38.280 --> 03:39.474
to think on this one.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.317
DIANE:
You're on your way back?

03:41.350 --> 03:42.840
WILL:
In about 30 minutes. Why?

03:42.890 --> 03:44.016
Kalinda thinks we might have

03:44.050 --> 03:45.483
a possibility
on this torture case.

03:45.520 --> 03:46.418
Really?

03:46.460 --> 03:47.711
I thought everything
was top-top secret.

03:47.760 --> 03:51.025
KALINDA:
Well, there might be a way
to find evidence of Danny

03:51.060 --> 03:52.618
at the camp through
not-top-secret means.

03:52.660 --> 03:55.026
But it'll mean taking the case
to the next level--

03:55.060 --> 03:56.561
confrontationally.

03:56.600 --> 03:57.692
And you're wondering
if I'm all right

03:57.730 --> 03:58.822
with poking the bear
even harder?

03:58.870 --> 04:00.394
Yes... so to speak.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.408
This is not some corrupt
oil company

04:02.440 --> 04:04.260
that we can pressure
to settle, Diane.

04:04.310 --> 04:05.436
This is the government.

04:05.470 --> 04:07.529
They can make life hard for us.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.901
GRACE (ringtone):
Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.
Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.339
Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.
(gasps)

04:14.350 --> 04:16.284
I...

04:16.320 --> 04:17.617
Where are you, Will?

04:18.620 --> 04:20.713
Lunch.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.954
(gasps)

04:21.990 --> 04:24.720
Grace. Hi. What's up?

04:24.760 --> 04:26.728
Okay, I'll, uh... I'll see you
back here in a half an hour?

04:26.760 --> 04:27.897
WILL:
Right.

04:27.930 --> 04:29.727
Yeah, I'll be there
in about half hour.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.761
Bye.

04:34.500 --> 04:35.728
(beep)

04:35.770 --> 04:38.034
Lisa, could you get Alicia
for me?

04:38.070 --> 04:40.277
Sure.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.747
She's at lunch.

04:43.780 --> 04:46.340
Her assistant said
she'll be back in a half hour.

04:50.050 --> 04:51.347
Sorry. What?

04:51.390 --> 04:53.756
Um, I want to go to Bible study.

04:53.790 --> 04:55.610
You want to go
to a Bible study?

04:55.660 --> 04:56.684
Yes. Can I go?

04:56.730 --> 04:58.459
Um, let me think
about it, okay?

04:58.490 --> 05:00.390
I'm at a lunch. I'll
call you afterward.

05:00.430 --> 05:02.057
It's kind of late for lunch.

05:02.100 --> 05:04.364
Yes, it is. Thank you.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.766
I'll call you back.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.336
(sighs)

05:08.370 --> 05:10.338
MAN: _
How many times

05:10.370 --> 05:13.737
does Jesus condemn gays
in the Bible? (clicks tongue)

05:13.780 --> 05:16.874
How many times does Jesus
condemn divorce?

05:16.910 --> 05:18.104
Six times.

05:18.150 --> 05:19.708
But listen

05:19.750 --> 05:22.389
to any preacher, and who
do they say is going to hell?

05:22.420 --> 05:25.583
Gays, not your divorced parents.

05:25.620 --> 05:28.111
MAN:
2,000 meals a day.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.128
We contract with the military

05:30.160 --> 05:33.721
for breakfast, lunch and dinner,
and during Ramadan, one large

05:33.760 --> 05:34.795
meal at night.

05:34.830 --> 05:36.969
And these were for the inmates
at Camp Whitcomb?

05:37.000 --> 05:39.662
Yes. People don't think about
making meals in a war zone,

05:39.700 --> 05:40.860
but people have to eat.

05:40.900 --> 05:41.832
Um, was there
anything unusual

05:41.870 --> 05:43.906
about these meals?
Well, they had to conform

05:43.940 --> 05:45.828
with Muslim
dietary restrictions.

05:45.870 --> 05:49.772
You should have seen the books
our chefs had to read.

05:49.810 --> 05:51.675
ALICIA:
Did you prepare any meals
for food allergies?

05:51.710 --> 05:52.813
ZSCHAU:
Objection, Your Honor.

05:52.850 --> 05:54.078
This testimony infringes

05:54.120 --> 05:55.610
on the Classified Information
Procedures Act.

05:55.650 --> 05:57.447
The composition of a meal does?

05:57.490 --> 05:59.685
Yes, it could disclose
the identity of fighters

05:59.720 --> 06:01.415
housed there.

06:01.460 --> 06:03.587
Well, Mr. Zschau, unfortunately,
the US. will just have to stand

06:03.630 --> 06:05.621
tall in the face of their
meals being exposed.

06:05.660 --> 06:06.729
You may answer.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.923
Yes, we get requests for special
meals, but not many.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.824
Our client, Mr. Marwat,

06:11.870 --> 06:15.067
not only required
the usual Muslim

06:15.100 --> 06:17.466
dietary requirements,
but he was also diagnosed

06:17.510 --> 06:19.831
as lactose intolerant
at the age of five.

06:19.880 --> 06:24.442
This is a food order form
that was sent to your company

06:24.480 --> 06:27.449
dated September 20, 2007,

06:27.480 --> 06:31.439
the same day our client
was sent to Camp Whitcomb.

06:31.490 --> 06:32.809
Can you please read

06:32.860 --> 06:34.054
the left-hand column?

06:34.090 --> 06:36.979
"Ramadan fasting meal.
Quantity: one."

06:37.030 --> 06:37.951
And underneath it?

06:37.990 --> 06:39.628
"Lactose free."

06:40.900 --> 06:42.151
(sighs)

06:42.200 --> 06:44.168
JUDGE:
So here's the thing.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.861
I look at these issues simply.

06:45.900 --> 06:48.994
I think there is now convincing
corroborative evidence

06:49.040 --> 06:51.008
that Mr. Marwat was
at Camp Whitcomb,

06:51.040 --> 06:54.601
so I'm going to allow
this lawsuit to go forward.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.608
Mr. Childs, please instruct

06:56.650 --> 06:58.470
the Defense Department
to turn over all

06:58.510 --> 07:00.148
the secret court transcripts
requested

07:00.180 --> 07:01.545
by the plaintiff's attorneys.

07:01.580 --> 07:02.842
GLENN:
We would also request

07:02.890 --> 07:04.778
Executive Order 13224.

07:06.250 --> 07:09.720
Excuse me, Your Honor,
13224 is intended

07:09.760 --> 07:12.149
to _ferret out_ fake charities
funding terrorist organizations.

07:12.190 --> 07:14.158
This is a lawsuit
Danny has brought

07:14.200 --> 07:15.849
against the United States
government.

07:15.900 --> 07:18.198
Yes, but 13224 also
has broad application

07:18.230 --> 07:19.959
when a terrorist
hires a lawyer...

07:20.000 --> 07:21.160
What?
Danny is not
a terrorist.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.758
Or suspected terrorist.

07:22.810 --> 07:25.506
That lavwer must make available
for inspection

07:25.540 --> 07:27.770
"any relevant information,
reports or records

07:27.810 --> 07:30.745
requested by the Secretary
of the Treasury."

07:30.780 --> 07:32.475
Your Honor,
this is an egregious violation

07:32.520 --> 07:33.612
of attorney-client privilege.

07:33.650 --> 07:36.016
I would agree,

07:36.050 --> 07:38.018
and yet, it's the law.

07:38.050 --> 07:39.210
So make an attorney available

07:39.250 --> 07:42.629
to meet with a duly-appointed
official of the Treasury.

07:42.660 --> 07:45.549
(bangs gavel)

07:45.590 --> 07:46.750
You meet with him.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.859
I've never done this
before.
No one has.

07:48.900 --> 07:51.926
We're in a strange,
new post-9/11 world.

07:51.970 --> 07:53.961
None of the
rules apply.

08:12.190 --> 08:14.078
I've become obsessed
with cupcakes.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.052
No, thank you.

08:15.090 --> 08:16.250
Mm. Smart.

08:16.290 --> 08:18.281
They're 497 calories each.

08:18.330 --> 08:21.754
So, this is the official
part, Mrs. Florrick.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.689
It'll be painless, don't worry.

08:24.730 --> 08:26.129
Uh, "I'm Gordon Higgs,

08:26.170 --> 08:28.263
"the designated Treasury
Secretary monitor

08:28.300 --> 08:30.837
"for trial case #670-3.

08:30.870 --> 08:32.599
"Your firm, Lockhart/Gardner,

08:32.640 --> 08:35.632
"has been granted a license
to represent Mr. Marwat

08:35.680 --> 08:38.046
"in his lawsuit against the
United States of America,

08:38.080 --> 08:40.219
which requires periodic
reporting to my office."

08:40.250 --> 08:43.845
Are you...

08:43.890 --> 08:46.586
Alicia Florrick,

08:46.620 --> 08:48.315
the lavwer designated
by your firm to report?

08:48.360 --> 08:49.850
I am.
Good.

08:49.890 --> 08:51.221
So how's it going?

08:51.260 --> 08:52.955
How's it going?

08:53.000 --> 08:54.251
Fine.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.598
Good. First questions first.

08:56.630 --> 09:01.897
_Is Mr. Daniel Marwat involved
in your trial strategy sessmns?

09:03.370 --> 09:05.736
Don't worry.
I'm with Treasury.

09:05.770 --> 09:06.805
There is no contact

09:06.840 --> 09:08.979
between my office
and the Department of Justice.

09:09.010 --> 09:11.945
They won't hear an inkling
of what we say here today.

09:11.980 --> 09:14.619
So, is Mr. Marwat involved
in strategy?

09:14.650 --> 09:16.345
Yes.

09:16.380 --> 09:17.745
Good.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.587
Has anybody else been involved?

09:19.620 --> 09:22.157
I mean, anybody else
other than your firm lawyers

09:22.190 --> 09:24.329
_ involved _
in these strategy sessmns?

09:24.360 --> 09:25.987
No.

09:26.030 --> 09:28.658
Uh, no one of Middle
Eastern descent?

09:28.700 --> 09:30.065
No.

09:30.100 --> 09:33.934
Uh, who is...
uh, Kalinda Sharma?

09:35.070 --> 09:37.300
She's an investigator
with our firm.

09:37.340 --> 09:38.637
But she's not...

09:38.670 --> 09:39.705
She's an employee.

09:39.740 --> 09:41.708
Mm, I know, but she's not
a firm lawyer, right?

09:41.740 --> 09:42.843
That was my question.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.246
Look, we're not, uh...

09:45.280 --> 09:47.111
You're not getting anybody
in trouble here.

09:47.150 --> 09:48.378
This is not naming names.

09:48.420 --> 09:52.049
And I'm just trying to figure
out the cast of characters, so,

09:52.090 --> 09:54.650
has Mr. _Marwat mentioned
receivmg remuneration

09:54.690 --> 09:56.317
of any kind from overseas?

09:56.360 --> 09:57.987
No, not to my knowledge.

09:58.030 --> 10:00.328
Have you ever observed him
making calls overseas?

10:00.360 --> 10:03.067
No.
But you have seen
him make calls?

10:03.100 --> 10:05.091
I...

10:06.100 --> 10:07.965
Yes.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.160
On how many occasions?

10:09.200 --> 10:10.406
Um,

10:10.440 --> 10:12.670
well, he's been with our firm

10:12.710 --> 10:14.007
for six months now,

10:14.040 --> 10:17.100
so, after witness prep,

10:17.150 --> 10:18.640
I-I think twice.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.671
Was he speaking
EngHsh?

10:21.680 --> 10:24.080
I-I don't remember. I mean,

10:24.120 --> 10:25.678
I...

10:25.720 --> 10:27.381
I was... wasn't
close enough to tell.

10:27.420 --> 10:30.253
Was anybody at your firm
close enough to say?

10:32.160 --> 10:34.151
No.

10:36.030 --> 10:37.827
Have you ever heard
Mr. Marwat mention

10:37.870 --> 10:39.360
the Afghan region
of Badula Qulp?

10:39.400 --> 10:41.391
I-I think
I pronounced that correctly.

10:41.440 --> 10:42.839
No.

10:42.870 --> 10:44.132
He never mentioned

10:44.170 --> 10:46.730
Badula... Badula...

10:46.780 --> 10:48.179
It's so hard to say this word.

10:48.210 --> 10:49.302
Badula Qulp?

10:49.340 --> 10:51.376
No, not to my knowledge.

10:51.410 --> 10:53.970
Could you please make a note
if he ever does in the future?

10:54.020 --> 10:57.842
Mr. Higgs,
I'm not an investigator

10:57.890 --> 10:59.778
for the Treasury Department.

10:59.820 --> 11:01.856
I'm a lawyer representing
Mr. Marwat.

11:01.890 --> 11:03.687
I know, I know, my apologies.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.880
I... I put that inelegantly.

11:05.930 --> 11:08.728
So let's get another meeting
on the books

11:08.760 --> 11:09.556
and we'll
talk then.

11:09.600 --> 11:12.068
_ I'm _not here
to investigate for you.

11:12.100 --> 11:13.761
I know.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.860
We'll just meet and talk.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.716
DIANE: _
The good news is,

11:34.760 --> 11:36.387
they complied
with our subpoenas.

11:36.420 --> 11:37.421
The bad news is,

11:37.460 --> 11:39.758
they depo
dumped us.

11:39.800 --> 11:40.926
These are
transcripts

11:40.960 --> 11:45.420
of hundreds of secret court
proceedings, all redacted.

11:45.470 --> 11:46.266
(groaning)

11:46.300 --> 11:49.167
And yet we have
to scour every page.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.202
Sometimes the censors miss
something.

11:51.240 --> 11:52.400
And Danny is here to help.

11:52.440 --> 11:54.305
You find any name
in this transcript

11:54.340 --> 11:55.477
you don't
understand,

11:55.510 --> 11:57.899
run it by Danny--
any region, anything.

11:57.950 --> 12:00.111
If he recognizes it, it means
we're on the right track.

12:00.150 --> 12:01.219
WILL:
The right track to what?

12:01.250 --> 12:02.444
To finding a
governmental official

12:02.480 --> 12:04.948
who ordered Danny's
arrest and torture.

12:04.990 --> 12:06.446
That's what we need to win.

12:06.490 --> 12:08.014
Kalinda,
what do you have?

12:08.060 --> 12:09.357
Well, at the moment,
nothing.

12:09.390 --> 12:10.254
I've been trying

12:10.290 --> 12:12.087
to locate army personnel
at Camp Whitcomb,

12:12.130 --> 12:13.392
but no one wants
to talk.

12:13.430 --> 12:14.920
What about retired officers?

12:14.960 --> 12:15.927
I'm looking into it.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.359
Okay, go run with it.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.766
Diane, can we talk?

12:19.800 --> 12:21.336
My meeting
with the monitor.

12:21.370 --> 12:22.359
Oh, sure, in a minute.

12:24.370 --> 12:26.065
WILL:
Why are we doing this?

12:26.110 --> 12:27.771
Government's not going
to cough up $6 million,

12:27.810 --> 12:29.209
and you know it, so
why are we doing this?

12:29.240 --> 12:31.947
Because it's
the right thing to do.

12:31.980 --> 12:34.039
No, you think
it's the right thing to do.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.115
I was in DC. on 9/11.

12:35.150 --> 12:37.118
Oh, please, what does that
have to do with anything?

12:37.150 --> 12:39.983
Our government took steps
to prevent another 9/11.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.351
I saw the smoke
from the Pentagon.

12:41.390 --> 12:42.482
Danny is innocent.

12:42.520 --> 12:43.953
Which is why he's free.

12:43.990 --> 12:45.423
After he was tortured.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.496
Wait, do you think
anybody's being tortured now

12:47.530 --> 12:48.849
under your friend Obama?

12:48.900 --> 12:50.822
Do you think anybody's
being tortured?

12:50.870 --> 12:51.768
I don't know.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.893
No, you're trying to
fight an old war, Diane.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.134
Rumsfeld and
Cheney are gone.

12:55.170 --> 12:56.137
They're writing books.

12:56.170 --> 12:57.137
(knocking)

12:57.170 --> 12:58.307
Come on in, Bob.

12:58.340 --> 13:01.104
Oh, I don't want to interrupt,
but you called me.
Yes.

13:01.140 --> 13:04.371
Will, this is Bob Lachness,
our insurance agent.

13:04.410 --> 13:07.140
We need to re-up
our insurance for next year,

13:07.180 --> 13:09.045
and Mr. Lachness has a question
or two for us.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.012
You said
you might want

13:10.050 --> 13:12.382
to raise your workplace
insurance amount.

13:12.420 --> 13:13.887
Am I really needed for this?

13:13.920 --> 13:15.387
We usually decide this together.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.980
Uh, workplace insurance is...?

13:18.030 --> 13:19.520
It's suits from employees--

13:19.560 --> 13:22.393
sexual harassment,
coworkers or bosses

13:22.430 --> 13:24.364
sleeping with underlings,
you know, that stuff.

13:24.400 --> 13:25.526
And you were saying
about savings?

13:25.570 --> 13:28.437
Yeah, I can keep your cost low

13:28.470 --> 13:30.904
if you have everybody here take
a sexual harassment class.

13:30.940 --> 13:33.909
Hmm.

13:35.580 --> 13:38.003
What do
you think, Will?

13:38.050 --> 13:42.578
I think I trust your judgment,
Diane, as you trust mine.

13:42.620 --> 13:44.815
You have my proxy.

13:47.420 --> 13:50.287
CAITLIN:
Wow, this is just...

13:50.330 --> 13:53.219
WOW.

13:53.260 --> 13:54.420
Yep.

13:54.460 --> 13:57.167
They're like
reading a puzzle.

13:57.200 --> 14:00.169
"Question: Is this wiretap
really necessary, Counselor?

14:00.200 --> 14:01.394
Answer.. "

14:01.440 --> 14:03.101
It is, Your Honor.
CAITLIN:
"Question..."

14:03.140 --> 14:04.107
JUDGE:
Could you please
extrapolate,

14:04.140 --> 14:06.028
Counselor?
Certainly.

14:06.070 --> 14:09.528
If you'd please refer
to page 18 of the (bleep)...

14:09.580 --> 14:11.400
...before emigrating
to the US.

14:11.450 --> 14:15.318
And did Dr. (bleep) accused?

14:15.350 --> 14:16.317
We intend

14:16.350 --> 14:18.318
no disrespect, Your Honor.

14:18.350 --> 14:21.615
(bleep) of this clan,

14:21.660 --> 14:25.118
and not (bleep) through
his mother.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.651
Wow, it's impossible.

14:27.700 --> 14:28.689
Wait, listen.

14:28.730 --> 14:31.563
"Question: And in these
sessions at Camp 'blank,‘

14:31.600 --> 14:32.669
"who was _
your medical authority?

14:32.700 --> 14:33.837
Answer.. "

14:33.870 --> 14:37.499
As required by the court,
we had on call Dr. (bleep).

14:37.540 --> 14:40.236
And did Dr. (bleep) any comment

14:40.280 --> 14:42.578
regarding the accused?

14:42.610 --> 14:44.168
Look how long
the blacked-out name is.

14:45.980 --> 14:47.971
We might have found something
in the transcripts.

14:49.550 --> 14:51.518
What?

14:51.550 --> 14:53.154
The secret court
transcripts refer

14:53.190 --> 14:55.579
to an army medical doctor
who was there to observe

14:55.620 --> 14:56.928
_the enhanced
interrogations.

14:56.960 --> 14:59.053
His_ name is referenced
in several places.

14:59.090 --> 15:00.591
There, there, and there.

15:00.630 --> 15:01.597
Yes,

15:01.630 --> 15:02.528
redacted.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.699
But look at the length
of the redacted name.

15:04.730 --> 15:06.664
The length of the redaction,
if measured out,

15:06.700 --> 15:09.965
is approximately
12 letters long.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.238
My guess--
if we cross-reference it

15:11.270 --> 15:13.670
with army
medical doctors,

15:13.710 --> 15:16.178
we'll find only a few
with a name of that length.

15:16.210 --> 15:17.279
I'll get Kalinda on it.

15:17.310 --> 15:18.299
Good job.

15:20.080 --> 15:23.243
Diane, about my meeting
with the monitor,

15:23.290 --> 15:25.508
he asked if Danny had spoken
to anyone overseas.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.017
What did you say?

15:27.060 --> 15:28.254
I said I didn't know.

15:28.290 --> 15:29.416
(sighs)
This is so bizarre.

15:29.460 --> 15:31.155
Where is attorney-
client privilege?

15:31.190 --> 15:34.023
He also asked if Danny had
ever mentioned Badula Qulp,

15:34.060 --> 15:35.527
a region
in Afghanistan.

15:35.560 --> 15:36.629
Why did he ask that?

15:36.660 --> 15:37.661
I have no idea,

15:37.700 --> 15:39.292
but I have
to report back tomorrow.

15:39.330 --> 15:41.537
He's trying to make
you his eyes and ears.

15:41.570 --> 15:43.231
There's a Chinese wall
between Justice and Treasury,

15:43.270 --> 15:47.070
but obviously
this makes me uncomfortable.

15:47.110 --> 15:48.702
Obviously.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.139
Okay, thank
you, Alicia.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.548
PETER:
So, uh...

15:58.590 --> 16:02.048
this Wi|_| Gardner
investigation--

16:02.090 --> 16:03.182
you're against it?

16:03.230 --> 16:07.018
I'm...

16:07.060 --> 16:08.425
Yes.

16:08.460 --> 16:10.564
I think it's too fraught.

16:10.600 --> 16:13.569
He's my old boss,
your wife is his new...

16:13.600 --> 16:15.534
employee.

16:15.570 --> 16:17.561
So you think we
should dump it?

16:19.610 --> 16:22.329
I think if Will Gardner
were anybody else,

16:22.380 --> 16:24.541
we wouldn't go forward,

16:24.580 --> 16:26.275
and that's the_rule
you've used until now.

16:26.310 --> 16:29.518
I know, which is why we have
to go fonNard, unfortunately.

16:29.550 --> 16:31.438
If it were just anyone
else, we'd pursue it.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.445
I disagree.

16:32.490 --> 16:35.118
There's no drugs here
and no homeland security.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.048
There is drugs.

16:37.090 --> 16:40.253
We'd use Will Gardner to go
after his drug dealer client

16:40.300 --> 16:42.393
Lemond Bishop.

16:42.430 --> 16:44.762
So you want
to pursue it?

16:46.800 --> 16:49.496
I want you
to pursue it.

16:49.540 --> 16:51.201
Dana's out the door.

16:51.240 --> 16:52.434
You've worked
at Lockhart/Gardner before.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.233
(phone ringing)

16:54.280 --> 16:57.602
I need you to pick up
the reins on this.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.049
Then I will.

17:01.620 --> 17:03.611
Hello.

17:03.650 --> 17:04.719
It's Mom.

17:04.750 --> 17:06.513
I'm so sorry
to bother you at work,

17:06.550 --> 17:08.484
but I just have
a quick question.

17:08.520 --> 17:09.714
You can pick the kids up, right?

17:09.760 --> 17:11.352
'Cause I can't get
out of here till 7:00.

17:11.390 --> 17:13.199
Oh, yes, I'm there now,
it'sjust, um...

17:13.230 --> 17:15.551
Grace wants to go
to a Bible study.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.522
Mom already
said I could.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.492
JACKIE:
I just want to be sure
it's fine with you.

17:19.530 --> 17:21.066
W-Where is it?

17:21.100 --> 17:22.089
That's the thing.

17:22.140 --> 17:23.835
It's at a nightclub.

17:23.870 --> 17:25.132
It's not at
a nightclub.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.706
They're just
borrowing the space.

17:26.740 --> 17:29.379
A-A-Alicia said it was fine,
but I don't know.

17:29.410 --> 17:30.741
To me, it sounds a bit cockeyed.

17:30.780 --> 17:34.511
What kind of Bible study
is at a nightclub?

17:34.550 --> 17:36.472
Uh, if Grace wants to go,
it's fine with me.

17:36.520 --> 17:38.078
My name is Dr. Val Phouayvongsa.

17:38.120 --> 17:40.088
JUDGE:
Could you spell that, please?

17:40.120 --> 17:42.156
P-H-O-U-A-

17:42.190 --> 17:45.580
Y-V-O-N-G-S-A.

17:45.630 --> 17:46.688
Thank you, Doctor.

17:46.730 --> 17:48.459
What was your job in 2007?

17:48.500 --> 17:50.320
I advised officers on advanced
interrogation methods.

17:50.370 --> 17:51.598
ALICIA:
Such as?

17:51.630 --> 17:52.858
Abdomen strikes.

17:52.900 --> 17:56.688
I explained how an open-handed
slap was preferable to a punch,

17:56.740 --> 17:58.731
which could cause
internal damage

17:58.770 --> 18:01.170
and thus be considered,
uh, torture.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.098
ALICIA:
And did you supervise the
interrogation of Danny Marwat

18:03.150 --> 18:05.141
on November 12?

18:05.180 --> 18:06.340
No.
Strike that.

18:06.380 --> 18:08.848
Were you asked to examine
an inmate after an interrogation

18:08.880 --> 18:10.108
on November 12?

18:10.150 --> 18:11.344
I was, but,
but I didn't see him.

18:11.390 --> 18:12.345
He was hooded.

18:12.390 --> 18:13.414
I understand,
but did you hear

18:13.460 --> 18:15.212
the officers refer
to him by name?

18:15.260 --> 18:16.352
I did.
And what was
that name?

18:16.390 --> 18:17.584
Danny.

18:17.630 --> 18:20.428
ALICIA:
Thank you, no
further questions.

18:20.460 --> 18:21.791
Mr. Zschau, anything?
No, Your Honor,

18:21.830 --> 18:24.128
but we do have
a rebuttal witness.

18:24.170 --> 18:24.864
Do you need a subpoena?

18:24.900 --> 18:26.822
No, he's here, Your Honor.

18:26.870 --> 18:28.132
Danny Marwat.

18:29.940 --> 18:32.238
Good morning,
Mr. Marwat.

18:32.270 --> 18:33.271
Good morning.

18:33.310 --> 18:34.868
Who is that?

18:34.910 --> 18:36.207
DANNY:
That?

18:36.240 --> 18:38.549
Um, it looks like me.

18:38.580 --> 18:39.547
In Afghanistan?

18:39.580 --> 18:41.639
Yes, before my arrest.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.911
Actually, a week
before your arrest.

18:44.950 --> 18:46.508
I was thinner then.

18:46.550 --> 18:47.687
We all were.

18:47.720 --> 18:48.687
ZSCHAU:
Can you, uh,

18:48.720 --> 18:52.258
zoom out
on the photo, please?

18:52.290 --> 18:53.393
Who's that?

18:53.430 --> 18:55.853
I don't know.

18:55.900 --> 18:57.527
ZSCHAU :
Really?

18:57.570 --> 18:58.923
You seem
to be chatting with him.

18:58.970 --> 19:01.734
I...

19:01.770 --> 19:03.328
(sighs)

19:03.370 --> 19:04.928
He looks familiar,

19:04.970 --> 19:05.834
but...

19:05.870 --> 19:07.929
Would you be surprised
to know that that is

19:07.980 --> 19:09.470
Satar Yusuf—Khel?
DIANE:
Your Honor,

19:09.510 --> 19:10.943
we ask for a recess.
The tribal leader that you swore

19:10.980 --> 19:12.800
to this court
you never met.
We need to consult with our...

19:12.850 --> 19:15.239
A man connected to al-Qaeda.
Your Honor, please.

19:15.280 --> 19:19.239
WILL:
Okay, you did know
this tribal leader?

19:19.290 --> 19:20.359
(sighs)

19:20.390 --> 19:21.789
It's not what they're saying.

19:22.820 --> 19:25.687
But you lied--
you knew him.

19:25.730 --> 19:28.790
No, no, his daughter was
dying from dysentery.

19:28.830 --> 19:30.821
I brought him medicine,
that's all.

19:30.870 --> 19:32.223
I took it to his home

19:32.270 --> 19:33.237
in Badula Qulp.

19:33.270 --> 19:35.693
Okay, wait,
stop right there.

19:35.740 --> 19:38.709
Alicia, could you
please step out?

19:38.740 --> 19:40.276
Why?
Alicia's meeting

19:40.310 --> 19:43.575
with the monitor--
he asked about Badula Qulp.

19:43.610 --> 19:47.979
But-- wait, what?

19:48.020 --> 19:50.215
She has to tell the monitor
what Danny just said

19:50.250 --> 19:54.459
according to the terms
of our 13224 license.

19:54.490 --> 19:55.650
Yes, but if
that's true,

19:55.690 --> 19:59.649
she'll also have to tell him
we asked her to step outside.

19:59.690 --> 20:01.328
This is crazy.

20:01.360 --> 20:05.399
Okay, so you didn't ask
Alicia to step outside.

20:05.430 --> 20:08.467
No, I did, but then
I thought better of it.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.559
Okay.

20:11.610 --> 20:13.976
We're going to stop
this meeting

20:14.010 --> 20:16.604
for a minute.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.608
You poked the bear, I asked
you not to poke the bear.

20:18.650 --> 20:20.345
Would you stop
with the bear talk?

20:20.380 --> 20:21.608
They've been right
since day one--

20:21.650 --> 20:22.617
our client did it.

20:22.650 --> 20:23.810
To save a girl's life.

20:23.850 --> 20:26.011
Oh, he's a real
humanitarian, Diane.
Stop.

20:26.050 --> 20:27.415
Alicia can see

20:27.460 --> 20:28.688
that we're arguing,
so just calm down.

20:31.460 --> 20:33.018
We drop the suit.

20:33.060 --> 20:34.857
I don't care
if he was tortured.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.322
He lied to us.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.429
I agree.

20:37.470 --> 20:38.425
(knocking)

20:38.470 --> 20:39.391
Sorry to interrupt.

20:39.430 --> 20:41.432
Will, there's a call
for you from Cary Agos.

20:41.470 --> 20:42.437
He says
it's important.

20:42.470 --> 20:43.437
Maybe this is good news.

20:43.470 --> 20:44.767
Maybe he wants to give me money.

20:44.810 --> 20:46.300
What's up, Cary?

20:46.340 --> 20:48.501
Well, a lot of things.

20:48.540 --> 20:51.873
Um, do you have
some time to talk today?

20:51.910 --> 20:53.844
About what?
We have an ongoing

20:53.880 --> 20:55.040
investigation, and...

20:55.080 --> 20:57.048
we...

20:57.080 --> 20:58.911
we need to have
some questions answered.

20:58.950 --> 20:59.917
(chuckles)

20:59.950 --> 21:01.588
Am I under indictment?

21:01.620 --> 21:03.349
(laughs)

21:03.390 --> 21:05.381
No, not yet.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.990
H, I just-- I think it's
just the name-- red velvet--

21:08.030 --> 21:10.624
it just makes it
so desirable.

21:10.670 --> 21:11.659
Just so you know,

21:11.700 --> 21:13.793
Mr. Higgs, there'll be
no more need for monitoring.

21:13.840 --> 21:14.989
We're dropping
the civil case.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.838
No, no, um, actually, there
is need for monitoring,

21:17.870 --> 21:19.838
so please sit down.
No, thank you.

21:19.870 --> 21:22.373
No, you don't understand.

21:22.410 --> 21:25.299
Justice has brought criminal
charges against Mr. Marwat.

21:25.350 --> 21:29.013
They're...
what criminal charges?

21:29.050 --> 21:31.416
My guess is aiding and
abetting a terrorist,

21:31.450 --> 21:34.988
but again, we have a Chinese
wall, so I'm just guessing,

21:35.020 --> 21:37.488
but please sit down.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.885
Even if you're not going
to be the attorneys,

21:39.930 --> 21:43.388
I need you
to sit down.

21:43.430 --> 21:44.397
Good.

21:44.430 --> 21:45.522
Now,

21:45.570 --> 21:50.439
since we last talked,
did Mr. Marwat mention anything

21:50.470 --> 21:52.938
about the Badula Qulp region?

21:57.010 --> 22:00.446
A-Alicia, do you want me
to repeat the question?

22:00.480 --> 22:01.674
No.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.515
Do you mind answering it?

22:05.550 --> 22:07.450
I do.

22:07.490 --> 22:10.425
I'm sorry, Alicia, but you have
to answer the question.

22:10.460 --> 22:11.552
I can't.

22:11.590 --> 22:12.682
Actually, you can.

22:12.730 --> 22:15.654
The penalty for not answering
is eight years in prison

22:15.700 --> 22:18.396
and a fine
of $250,000.

22:18.430 --> 22:21.467
So again, did Mr. Marwat

22:21.500 --> 22:23.502
mention Badula Qulp?

22:25.510 --> 22:28.434
Is it my right
to consult a lawyer?

22:31.710 --> 22:33.974
But I wouldn't advise it.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.409
I want to consult with a lawyer.

22:41.460 --> 22:43.428
(door opens)

22:43.460 --> 22:45.018
(door closes)

22:50.930 --> 22:51.919
And what did
he say then?

22:51.970 --> 22:53.699
He said he advised
against me getting a lawyer.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.162
Of course he did.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.997
DIANE:
You did the right thing.

22:57.040 --> 22:58.803
Danny talked
about meeting this tribal leader

22:58.840 --> 23:00.774
expecting attorney-client
privilege.

23:00.810 --> 23:03.074
But if you tell the monitor,
he'll be arrested.

23:03.110 --> 23:04.407
The penalty

23:04.450 --> 23:06.907
for my not answering
is a $250,000 fine

23:06.950 --> 23:09.373
and eight years in prison.

23:12.120 --> 23:14.657
Did he say anything
about the firm?

23:14.690 --> 23:16.658
The firm?

23:16.690 --> 23:21.696
Did the monitor ask
about what we said to you?

23:21.730 --> 23:22.822
No.

23:22.860 --> 23:24.566
DIANE:
They could still come after us.

23:24.600 --> 23:25.760
The whole firm.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.199
WILL:
Okay.

23:27.230 --> 23:30.802
We've talked to Nick Cotella
about representing you.

23:30.840 --> 23:34.139
And Nick is good, and he knows
this area inside and out.

23:34.180 --> 23:36.432
And we'll cover
the cost.

23:37.910 --> 23:39.878
Okay.

23:39.910 --> 23:42.140
I'll think about it.

23:42.180 --> 23:43.681
Think about what?

23:43.720 --> 23:45.210
Representation.

23:45.250 --> 23:47.559
Well, you need a
lawyer, Alicia.
I know.

23:47.590 --> 23:49.012
I just want
to explore my options.

23:49.060 --> 23:50.152
WILL:
Nick is good, Alicia.

23:50.190 --> 23:52.021
He's handled
these things before.

23:52.060 --> 23:54.028
Okay.

23:54.060 --> 23:56.051
Thanks.

24:12.080 --> 24:14.071
(elevator bell dings)

24:17.620 --> 24:20.248
Hello. Uh, Cary Agos
and Dana Lodge

24:20.290 --> 24:22.212
for Will Gardner.

24:22.260 --> 24:24.228
So Cary in his natural habitat?

24:24.260 --> 24:25.750
I could see you here.

24:25.790 --> 24:27.052
Aren't you supposed to be

24:27.090 --> 24:28.990
at your high-paying
defense attorney job?

24:29.030 --> 24:30.827
They delayed me a week.

24:30.870 --> 24:33.589
Yeah. I don't even _think
you have a new job.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.164
You're just like
one of those moms

24:35.200 --> 24:37.737
who lie about
being pregnant.

24:37.770 --> 24:40.637
That happens a lot
in your experience?

24:40.680 --> 24:42.568
(intercom beeps)
Hello? Hello?

24:42.610 --> 24:44.703
ALICIA:
It's okay.
I don't need any water.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.604
It'll just take a minute.

24:46.650 --> 24:49.676
Hello? Fantasia,
bottled water, please.

24:49.720 --> 24:50.789
MAN:
Who is this?

24:50.820 --> 24:53.709
Elsbeth Tascioni.

24:53.760 --> 24:54.749
Who's this?

24:54.790 --> 24:55.688
Get off my intercom.

24:55.720 --> 24:58.951
This is my intercom.
Ms. Tascioni, I'm fine.

24:58.990 --> 25:01.026
Sorry. It's just,
we had this wired yesterday

25:01.060 --> 25:02.857
to make life easier,
and now it's...

25:02.900 --> 25:04.492
(man growls)

25:05.900 --> 25:08.869
Aanay. . .

25:08.900 --> 25:12.131
I do understand the impossible
position 13224 puts you in.

25:12.170 --> 25:13.706
If you reveal what you know

25:13.740 --> 25:15.276
about your client,
he'll go to prison.

25:15.310 --> 25:18.040
If you refuse to talk,
you'll go.

25:18.080 --> 25:20.298
So, now you see
why I need a lawyer.
Oh, yes.

25:20.350 --> 25:22.875
I just don't see
why it needs to be me.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.808
Especially if your firm
is offering a hitter

25:24.850 --> 25:25.817
like Nick Cotella.

25:25.850 --> 25:29.809
I think I need a little distance
from my firm.

25:29.860 --> 25:31.680
Their issues aren't yours?

25:31.730 --> 25:33.152
They want to protect
their firm?

25:33.190 --> 25:35.556
And I saw how hard
you fought for Peter.

25:35.600 --> 25:36.919
If you hadn't gotten him
acquitted,

25:36.960 --> 25:38.063
he wouldn't be sitting

25:38.100 --> 25:39.965
in the State's
Attorney's office.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.934
Now you've got me blushing.

25:41.970 --> 25:44.564
MAN:
Who is this?
Who is on my intercom?

25:46.240 --> 25:48.800
Is your firm being aggressive
with this criminal case?

25:48.840 --> 25:50.239
We're trying.

25:50.280 --> 25:52.976
We want to have it quashed
in pretrial motions.

25:53.010 --> 25:54.978
Good. That's our strategy.

25:55.020 --> 25:57.011
We need to stall
your Treasury guy

25:57.050 --> 25:58.688
until the criminal case
goes away.

25:58.720 --> 26:01.314
They can't hold you
to 13224 if there's no case.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.850
Good.

26:02.890 --> 26:04.027
How?

26:04.060 --> 26:05.823
I don't know,
but it's a strategy.

26:05.860 --> 26:07.623
And a strategy
is better than none.

26:07.660 --> 26:09.719
You just don't worry, okay?

26:09.760 --> 26:12.228
I like that color on you.

26:12.270 --> 26:13.965
Deputy
State's Attorney? Wow.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.889
Peter Florrick better watch
his salt intake.

26:16.940 --> 26:18.601
Thanks.

26:18.640 --> 26:22.337
Um... I think you know
my colleague, Dana Lodge.

26:22.380 --> 26:24.109
Hawkins murder case last year.

26:24.150 --> 26:26.607
I like your office.
It's-It's big.

26:26.650 --> 26:28.049
Thank you.

26:28.080 --> 26:30.310
So what can I help you with?
Well, um,

26:30.350 --> 26:32.147
this is a bit awkward.
I don't know how to start.

26:32.190 --> 26:33.282
45,000.

26:33.320 --> 26:34.856
What was that?

26:34.890 --> 26:36.209
The attendance _
at the Bears game last night?

26:36.260 --> 26:38.387
Not unl_ess_the Bears were
playing in Baltimore.

26:38.430 --> 26:41.058
You took $45,000 from
a client's account

26:41.100 --> 26:42.192
to make up for a bad bet.

26:45.700 --> 26:47.395
Where are you getting
your information from?

26:47.430 --> 26:49.034
Someplace dependable.

26:49.070 --> 26:50.731
We're not after you,
Mr. Gardner.

26:50.770 --> 26:52.738
Even if we wanted
to be after you,

26:52.770 --> 26:54.135
it's not our jurisdiction.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.136
We're after your client,
Lemond Bishop.

26:56.180 --> 26:57.738
What's going on, Cary?

26:57.780 --> 27:00.669
Crystal meth
is a nationwide problem

27:00.720 --> 27:03.177
that has hit Cook County
particularly hard.

27:03.220 --> 27:05.688
Lemond Bishop is ground zero
for meth.

27:06.950 --> 27:08.178
And we represent

27:08.220 --> 27:10.313
his legitimate
business interests.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.157
You mean, his money laundering
interests?

27:16.060 --> 27:18.324
Let's get this on the record,
shall we?

27:22.470 --> 27:24.768
Did you need something,
Mr. Gardner?

27:24.810 --> 27:28.803
Yes. These two ASAs are from
the State's Attorney's office.

27:28.840 --> 27:32.742
Excuse me, one ASA and a deputy.

27:32.780 --> 27:34.077
And unless I'm mistaken,

27:34.120 --> 27:35.974
they're committing
a criminal act,

27:36.020 --> 27:37.317
using intimidation
to coerce me

27:37.350 --> 27:39.011
into breaking
attorney-client privilege.

27:39.050 --> 27:40.915
You are mistaken.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.416
Good. Then, please clarify.

27:42.460 --> 27:44.678
There is no privilege
if the attorney becomes aware

27:44.730 --> 27:45.685
of any illegal activities

27:45.730 --> 27:47.823
that his client intends
to commit in the future.

27:47.860 --> 27:49.452
Ah, so this was just an attempt

27:49.500 --> 27:51.798
to remind me __ _
of my legal responSIbilities?

27:51.830 --> 27:54.333
Yes, a reminder with teeth.

27:54.370 --> 27:57.191
Even if something may not land
in our jurisdiction,

27:57.240 --> 27:58.434
it's still
disbarrable.

27:58.470 --> 27:59.835
Thank you.

27:59.870 --> 28:01.132
I think the meeting's over now.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.356
How you doing?

28:18.390 --> 28:19.926
You liking it here?

28:19.960 --> 28:23.259
It's... exciting.

28:23.300 --> 28:25.495
And it'll only get more so.

28:25.530 --> 28:28.738
No. Let's just let
the moment resonate.

28:28.770 --> 28:31.364
Ms. Lockhart, you asked
to sue the government.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.162
I said, "Yes."

28:33.210 --> 28:35.371
Now you're dropping the suit,
and you,

28:35.410 --> 28:38.243
Mr. Childs, are taking
up a criminal case.

28:38.280 --> 28:41.272
And here we all are--
the same people,

28:41.320 --> 28:43.788
one week closer to the grave.

28:43.820 --> 28:46.414
GLENN:
New information has arisen
from Mr. Marwat's testimony

28:46.450 --> 28:48.259
in the civil case, Your Honor.

28:48.290 --> 28:50.850
That is why we have indicted
Mr. Marwat

28:50.890 --> 28:52.528
for perjury and for conspiracy

28:52.560 --> 28:53.754
to aid and_abet
a terrorist.

28:53.800 --> 28:56.849
I imagine you would like me
to consider a motion to dismiss,

28:56.900 --> 28:58.527
Ms. Lockhart.
Of course, Your Honor.

28:58.570 --> 28:59.468
On what grounds?

28:59.500 --> 29:01.536
On the grounds
that how else will I spend

29:01.570 --> 29:03.765
my Thursday afternoons if
the three of you aren't here?

29:03.810 --> 29:06.005
I will consider motions
at 10:00 tomorrow.

29:07.810 --> 29:09.801
(distant siren wailing)

29:17.120 --> 29:19.315
May I help you?

29:19.350 --> 29:24.049
Oh, um, my name is Elsbeth
Tascioni, and I represent...

29:24.090 --> 29:25.421
Oh, my gosh.

29:25.460 --> 29:28.258
That is the prettiest
cupcake I've ever seen.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.427
I represent Alicia Florrick.

29:30.460 --> 29:32.462
She's someone
you met With,

29:32.500 --> 29:35.162
and advised not
to get an attorney.

29:37.070 --> 29:39.038
Really? Well,
I would dispute that.

29:39.070 --> 29:41.209
Yes, I know you would.

29:41.240 --> 29:43.504
It's not great for a
Treasury Department official

29:43.540 --> 29:44.939
to advise that, is it?

29:44.980 --> 29:46.800
(laughs)
Is she bringing charges?

29:46.850 --> 29:48.477
No, she's much
too nice for that.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.476
That's why she has me.

29:50.520 --> 29:55.457
Well, you see, I...
I have office hours.

29:55.490 --> 29:58.220
Up in my office. Up there.

29:58.260 --> 30:01.423
And, um, this
is my lunch break.

30:01.460 --> 30:04.918
Oh, okay. I'll just, um...

30:04.970 --> 30:06.961
I'll just sit here then.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.208
Your client has a duty
as an American

30:11.240 --> 30:12.935
to help us
weed out terrorists.

30:12.970 --> 30:15.404
And-And even if that weren't
the case,

30:15.440 --> 30:18.375
she's under penalty of law
to answer all of my questions.

30:18.410 --> 30:21.573
Which my client is willing to do
in the presence of an attorney

30:21.620 --> 30:23.918
and with a grant
of transactional immunity.

30:23.950 --> 30:25.986
Your client_
wants immunity?
No.

30:26.020 --> 30:27.908
She doesn't. I do.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.882
You're trying to delay.

30:30.930 --> 30:32.420
Of course I am.

30:32.460 --> 30:34.451
Call me when you get the grant.

30:38.630 --> 30:41.269
Do you know where I can
get my parking validated?

30:41.300 --> 30:42.460
No.

30:42.500 --> 30:44.365
Okay. Sorry.

30:44.410 --> 30:47.129
You want me to... What?

30:47.170 --> 30:48.979
Yeah, I was thinking
about it all night.

30:49.010 --> 30:50.329
And I know you must be busy--

30:50.380 --> 30:52.348
I like that jacket,
by the way--

30:52.380 --> 30:54.211
but I need help with
one of my clients.

30:54.250 --> 30:56.639
Do you have any experience
with insurance companies?

30:56.680 --> 30:59.148
Do I? No.

30:59.190 --> 31:00.384
That's okay.

31:00.420 --> 31:02.411
It's, um... it's
much more interesting

31:02.460 --> 31:03.654
than you might think.

31:03.690 --> 31:06.329
If you could just
read these...

31:06.360 --> 31:09.249
No, not these.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.527
Hmm.

31:12.570 --> 31:13.992
These.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.065
And I'm doing this, uh, because?

31:16.100 --> 31:19.467
Well, Mr. Higgs, your
monitor, is going to ask you

31:19.510 --> 31:22.274
what I said here when I
handed over these files.

31:22.310 --> 31:25.302
And I just want you to be
clear about what I'm saying.

31:25.350 --> 31:27.147
Okay.

31:27.180 --> 31:30.547
I need your help on
this insurance case

31:30.580 --> 31:33.242
because I'm swamped.

31:33.290 --> 31:34.518
Look at all this paper.

31:34.560 --> 31:35.549
Phew.

31:35.590 --> 31:37.251
I need help.

31:37.290 --> 31:39.349
That's what you want me
to tell him?

31:39.390 --> 31:40.994
No, that's what
you will tell him

31:41.030 --> 31:42.452
because that's what
you heard me say.

31:43.460 --> 31:46.566
I'm...

31:46.600 --> 31:48.261
Okay.

31:57.040 --> 31:59.042
No, that's okay.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.547
Bye.

32:09.660 --> 32:11.525
(crowd chatter, horn honking)

32:12.660 --> 32:15.220
Go ahead.

32:16.230 --> 32:18.289
You're coming after me?

32:18.330 --> 32:20.195
Mr. Clean now.

32:20.230 --> 32:21.595
You're coming after me.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.335
If you're referring
to our task force,

32:23.370 --> 32:25.031
it's not about
coming after you.

32:25.070 --> 32:27.607
And if my ASAs gave you
that impression, I apologize.

32:27.640 --> 32:29.198
You sent them
to my office,

32:29.240 --> 32:31.105
trying to turn me
with this old B.S.

32:31.150 --> 32:33.971
Are you insane?
I think
you should calm down.

32:34.020 --> 32:35.476
I think you
should go to hell.

32:35.520 --> 32:36.748
You're not
above it, Peter.

32:36.780 --> 32:38.281
I don't care what conversion
you had in prison.

32:38.320 --> 32:39.742
You're in the mud just
like the rest of us.

32:39.790 --> 32:43.556
I'm not the one who's...

32:43.590 --> 32:46.229
Go ahead.
You're not the what? What?

32:46.260 --> 32:48.251
You're not the what?

32:49.660 --> 32:52.299
I have not gone there.

32:52.330 --> 32:55.538
Anything I've ever said
to you or done to you.

32:55.570 --> 32:56.559
I haven't gone there.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.363
Gone where?
Go ahead, say it.

32:58.410 --> 33:01.038
No.

33:03.140 --> 33:05.040
That's what this
is about, huh?

33:05.080 --> 33:07.640
Alicia. That's why you
tried to audit us,

33:07.680 --> 33:09.648
that's why you're
going for RICO.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.682
Oh, man, you're pitiful.

33:11.720 --> 33:14.154
Get a pair of balls
and throw a punch.

33:16.820 --> 33:20.278
I don't give a rat's ass
what you think it's about.

33:20.330 --> 33:23.026
You steal $45,000,
you go to jail.

33:23.060 --> 33:24.391
There's two of us here.

33:24.430 --> 33:27.297
Only one of us has seen
the inside of a cell.

33:27.330 --> 33:29.264
Have a good day, Counselor.

33:29.300 --> 33:30.528
You come after me,

33:30.570 --> 33:33.437
Peter, that's not where
this ends, you know it.

33:34.740 --> 33:37.106
I see you brought your lawyer,
Mrs. Florrick.
Yes.

33:37.140 --> 33:38.801
Mr. Higgs and I
met yesterday.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.408
Hello again.
Hello.

33:40.450 --> 33:41.519
Uh, are you ready?

33:41.550 --> 33:43.575
I... think
we are.
Good.

33:43.620 --> 33:44.746
So, Mrs. Florrick,

33:44.790 --> 33:47.042
did your client ever
mention Badula Qulp?

33:47.090 --> 33:49.558
Actually, I'm gonna ask
my client not to answer that

33:49.590 --> 33:51.785
until she has a grant
of transactional immunity.

33:51.830 --> 33:54.196
This is a grant
of limited immunity

33:54.230 --> 33:55.299
tied to your client's answers.

33:55.330 --> 33:57.798
As long as Mrs. Florrick
is forthcoming and truthful,

33:57.830 --> 33:59.525
she cannot be charged for any

33:59.570 --> 34:02.061
of her actions.
Okay. Let me read it.

34:02.100 --> 34:03.567
I sent a copy to your office.
Yes.

34:03.600 --> 34:06.728
Ijust... want to make sure
you haven't changed anything.

34:06.770 --> 34:08.806
It'll, um...

34:08.840 --> 34:11.570
it'll take about
30 minutes or so.

34:11.610 --> 34:14.317
This is a delaying tactic.
If you keep interrupting,

34:14.350 --> 34:16.739
I keep having
to go back to the top.

34:22.390 --> 34:26.224
JUDGE:
This arrest warrant, it
will be served in Afghanistan?

34:26.260 --> 34:28.194
Yes, Your Honor.
And this is based

34:28.230 --> 34:30.289
on the testimony
of Army intelligence officer

34:30.330 --> 34:31.524
Lieutenant (bleep)?

34:31.570 --> 34:34.198
Yes, Your Honor.
Lieutenant (bleep) complied

34:34.240 --> 34:36.629
with all necessary (bleep).

34:36.670 --> 34:38.865
His answers were (bleep),
Your Honor.
How do you mean

34:38.910 --> 34:40.798
(bleep), unresponsive?

34:40.840 --> 34:42.398
COUNSELOR:
No. Brief.

34:47.410 --> 34:49.844
CAITLIN:
I'm sorry to interrupt,
Ms. Lockhart.

34:49.880 --> 34:53.247
I'm Caitlin,
down in...
I know. What is it?

34:53.290 --> 34:54.416
Well, I normally
would go to Alicia

34:54.460 --> 34:57.111
with this first,
but I can't find her.
Yes. What is it?

34:57.160 --> 34:58.286
In the court
transcripts,

34:58.330 --> 34:59.888
the reason for the arrest is

34:59.930 --> 35:02.353
an Army intelligence officer,
but the name is redacted.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.163
Yes, I know.
But how they redact

35:04.200 --> 35:06.395
these transcripts is through a
program that searches for words.

35:06.430 --> 35:10.491
They double-check
by eye afterward...
Okay, Caitlin, I'm heading

35:10.540 --> 35:11.802
to court.
Oh, right, sorry.

35:11.840 --> 35:15.401
Here. "His answers were 'blank,‘
Your Honor."

35:15.440 --> 35:17.431
And here. "The suspect
was uncooperative.

35:17.480 --> 35:19.744
_His tone was 'blank'
With one-word answers."

35:22.250 --> 35:24.218
They redacted
the adjective.

35:24.250 --> 35:28.880
My guess is, their
redaction program
mistook it for a name.

35:28.920 --> 35:30.808
Cu rt?
Yes.

35:30.860 --> 35:32.851
"His answers were curt,

35:32.890 --> 35:34.289
"Your Honor.

35:34.330 --> 35:37.151
His tone was curt with
one-word answers."

35:37.200 --> 35:39.566
Or at least
that's my guess.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.591
Did you check?

35:42.640 --> 35:44.198
Lieutenant
Matthew Curt,

35:44.240 --> 35:46.458
Army.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.232
Nicely done, Caitlin.

35:50.280 --> 35:52.271
Thank you, Ms. Lockhart.

35:56.220 --> 35:58.711
O...kay.

35:58.750 --> 36:01.412
It looks hunky-dory.
Great. Thanks.

36:01.460 --> 36:04.179
So, Mrs. Florrick,
did Mr. Marwat mention

36:04.230 --> 36:07.188
Badula Qulp
since you last talked?
Actually, I'm gonna ask

36:07.230 --> 36:08.299
Mrs. Florrick

36:08.330 --> 36:10.696
not to answer that.

36:10.730 --> 36:13.198
I know, and I'm sorry
for frustrating you.

36:13.230 --> 36:16.199
It's just that, um, it
turns out, since we last spoke,

36:16.240 --> 36:18.265
uh, there's
a conflict of interest

36:18.310 --> 36:20.460
with regard to
Mrs. Florrick's representation.

36:23.740 --> 36:25.742
What conflict of interest?

36:25.780 --> 36:30.479
Your voice gets very intense
when you get quiet.

36:30.520 --> 36:33.318
It rattles me. Um...

36:33.350 --> 36:35.614
What was that?

36:35.660 --> 36:36.615
My conflict of interest.

36:36.660 --> 36:38.457
Right.

36:38.490 --> 36:41.994
Mrs. Florrick now represents
North Guard Insurance,

36:42.030 --> 36:44.328
the company that provides
liability coverage

36:44.370 --> 36:45.621
to employees

36:45.670 --> 36:47.797
of Martinel Security
working in Afghanistan,

36:47.830 --> 36:49.764
including Danny Marwat.

36:49.800 --> 36:51.461
You'll find it
in their...

36:51.510 --> 36:53.603
annual report.
It's that company

36:53.640 --> 36:55.505
that has the alligator

36:55.540 --> 36:57.599
in their commercials.

36:57.640 --> 37:00.006
Have you seen those?
They're so funny.

37:00.050 --> 37:02.939
Mrs. Florrick can't
answer your questions

37:02.980 --> 37:05.813
about her client, Mr. Marwat,
Without breaking

37:05.850 --> 37:08.956
attorney-client privilege
with North Guard.

37:08.990 --> 37:10.912
You see our problem here?

37:14.630 --> 37:17.793
When did you take North Guard
as a client, Mrs. Florrick?

37:17.830 --> 37:18.819
Yesterday.

37:18.870 --> 37:22.863
And, uh, did Ms. Tascioni
bring you this client?

37:24.570 --> 37:29.007
Yes. She told me
she needed help on the case.

37:29.040 --> 37:30.337
Do you know the penalty

37:30.380 --> 37:32.268
for lying,
Mrs. Florrick?
I do.

37:32.310 --> 37:35.313
What did Ms. Tascioni
tell you exactly

37:35.350 --> 37:37.545
when she brought you
this account?

37:37.580 --> 37:39.719
She said...

37:39.750 --> 37:43.288
"I need help
on this insurance case.

37:43.320 --> 37:45.288
"I'm swamped.

37:45.330 --> 37:47.025
Look at all this paper."

37:48.030 --> 37:50.954
I'm taking this to court.
Good.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.968
I think the courts
have shown a certain,

37:53.000 --> 37:55.434
let's say, affinity
to corporations

37:55.470 --> 37:57.495
like North Guard
and their rights.

37:57.540 --> 37:58.404
The Supreme Court

37:58.440 --> 38:00.465
has even insisted
on their personhood.

38:00.510 --> 38:02.705
My guess is, they
won't look kindly

38:02.740 --> 38:05.675
on your attempt to infringe on
their attorney-client privilege.

38:05.710 --> 38:07.075
(door opens, closes)

38:07.110 --> 38:08.748
(laughs softly)

38:08.780 --> 38:10.771
I want to learn from you.

38:10.820 --> 38:14.017
(laughs)
There's nothing
you can learn from me.

38:14.050 --> 38:16.883
I mean, I'm just, um...

38:21.090 --> 38:22.751
Let's go.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.961
Lieutenant Matthew Curt,
Army intelligence officer.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.900
Are you the officer
who authorized the use

38:32.940 --> 38:35.602
of enhanced interrogation
techniques on my client?

38:35.640 --> 38:37.005
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.

38:37.040 --> 38:38.598
_Mr. Marwat's civil
swt has been dropped.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.606
The circumstances
of his detention

38:40.650 --> 38:42.618
have nothing to do
with these charges.

38:42.650 --> 38:45.813
The prosecution obviously
has evidence against my client.

38:45.850 --> 38:47.989
We're simply trying to determine
how they came up

38:48.020 --> 38:49.954
with this evidence.
I'm thinking, thinking.

38:49.990 --> 38:51.014
Overruled.

38:51.060 --> 38:52.550
You may answer.

38:52.590 --> 38:54.023
I'm prohibited
from answering that

38:54.060 --> 38:55.789
under the Classified
Information Procedures Act.

38:55.830 --> 38:57.627
Your Honor,
the prosecution

38:57.660 --> 39:00.891
is basing its new conspiracy
charge against my client

39:00.930 --> 39:03.694
upon the interrogation
from the first arrest.

39:03.740 --> 39:04.900
But without

39:04.940 --> 39:07.909
Lieutenant Curt offering any
reason for this interrogation,

39:07.940 --> 39:10.773
the arrest and its
ensumg interrogation

39:10.810 --> 39:12.539
should be considered
inadmissible.

39:14.480 --> 39:17.779
Mr. Zschau, I've overruled
your objection.

39:17.820 --> 39:19.947
Lieutenant Curt may answer.

39:23.590 --> 39:25.820
Again, I'm prohibited
from answering that

39:25.860 --> 39:28.829
under the Classified
Information Procedures Act.
Then I'm sorry,

39:28.860 --> 39:32.091
Mr. Zschau, but the defense's
motion to dismiss is granted.

39:34.100 --> 39:35.089
Thank you, Your Honor.

39:38.540 --> 39:39.837
Thank you.

39:42.740 --> 39:45.675
(groans softly)

39:45.710 --> 39:47.541
(sighs)

39:47.580 --> 39:49.673
Are you getting divorced, Dad?

39:51.690 --> 39:53.817
I don't know. Why?

39:53.850 --> 39:56.114
I just don't know if you should.

39:56.160 --> 39:59.152
I_don't think it's
just up to me.

39:59.190 --> 40:02.091
You think Mom wants
to get a divorce?

40:02.130 --> 40:04.121
I don't know what
your mom wants.

40:05.170 --> 40:07.991
Mm. I think she just
wants to be happy.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.139
Yeah. I know.

40:11.170 --> 40:12.706
So do I.

40:12.740 --> 40:14.605
You're not?

40:14.640 --> 40:15.902
Well...

40:15.940 --> 40:17.999
I want to do the right thing,

40:18.040 --> 40:21.646
but sometimes it's hard
to know what the right thing is.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.443
Well, you should just ask me.

40:23.480 --> 40:25.619
(both laugh)

40:28.520 --> 40:30.511
Ask you.

40:34.630 --> 40:37.121
Um, I'm gonna be right back.
You okay?

40:37.160 --> 40:39.628
Yeah.
And then
we'll go home.

40:39.670 --> 40:41.661
Okay. I love you.

40:41.700 --> 40:44.863
And I love you.

40:44.910 --> 40:46.138
They just toyed with me.

40:46.170 --> 40:47.262
You don't know that.

40:47.310 --> 40:50.177
No, I do know that.
They used me like
a stalking horse

40:50.210 --> 40:51.871
to get the lawyer
they wanted, okay?

40:51.910 --> 40:55.744
You know, I... I told my mom
I was going to a new firm.

40:55.780 --> 40:57.042
Oh, God.

40:57.080 --> 41:01.756
(sighs) You want me
to call her and tell
her you screwed up?

41:01.790 --> 41:04.725
Don't try to cheer me up.

41:04.760 --> 41:05.727
Look”.

41:05.760 --> 41:08.558
I was working at a law firm
and they fired me...

41:08.600 --> 41:10.158
and you know what I did?

41:10.200 --> 41:13.988
Hm?
I decided to make them
regret that day.

41:14.030 --> 41:16.760
You work twice as hard
and you beat them.

41:16.800 --> 41:18.233
You beat every
defense attorney...

41:21.810 --> 41:23.801
Am I interrupting something?

41:23.840 --> 41:26.843
No, no, we're good.
We were just... just talking.

41:26.880 --> 41:28.575
Okay.

41:28.620 --> 41:30.838
I'm absenting myself from
the Lockhart/Gardner case.

41:30.880 --> 41:34.657
You want us to drop it?
No. It's a good case.

41:34.690 --> 41:37.579
I want you to report to
a special prosecutor;
I'll assign one.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.588
I have too
many conflicts

41:39.630 --> 41:40.927
of interest.

41:40.960 --> 41:41.699
Okay, we'll get on it.

41:42.930 --> 41:45.990
"We"? I thought
you were going.

41:46.030 --> 41:48.737
No. I was misled
by a law firm,

41:48.770 --> 41:50.590
so... I'm staying,

41:50.640 --> 41:52.039
and I'm pissed.

41:53.070 --> 41:55.174
Good. Pissed is good.

41:55.210 --> 41:57.303
It'll make you
a better lawyer.

41:57.340 --> 41:59.205
Then I'm gonna make
a pretty great lawyer.

41:59.250 --> 42:01.718
I blew it, Doug.

42:01.750 --> 42:04.116
No, Jan, you did
the best you could.

42:04.150 --> 42:05.811
Don't worry.

42:05.850 --> 42:07.681
Here.

42:07.720 --> 42:09.153
ANNOUNCER:
Sexuality--

42:09.190 --> 42:11.681
it's a significant part
of our culture,

42:11.730 --> 42:14.949
depicted in movies,
magazines and TV.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.697
But in the workplace,
sexuality can easily become...

42:18.730 --> 42:20.869
sexual harassment.

42:20.900 --> 42:22.265
*

42:25.840 --> 42:27.728
MAN:
It's not fair.

42:27.770 --> 42:29.829
Megan only got that promotion

42:29.880 --> 42:31.973
because she's sleeping
with the boss.

42:32.010 --> 42:34.342
ANNOUNCER:
When an authority figure

42:34.380 --> 42:36.712
becomes involved
With a subordinate,

42:36.750 --> 42:38.069
is that sexual harassment?

42:38.120 --> 42:39.246
Workplace dynamics...

42:39.290 --> 42:42.111
How you doing?

42:42.160 --> 42:44.287
Well, I'm not
going to jail.

42:44.320 --> 42:45.821
That's good.

42:45.860 --> 42:47.623
ANNOUNCER:
...can suddenly become

42:47.660 --> 42:49.799
upsetting, even hostile.

42:50.860 --> 42:52.066
What about you?

42:52.100 --> 42:53.761
You haven't been
around much?

42:53.800 --> 42:56.030
I've had a weird
few days.

42:56.070 --> 42:57.264
With what?

42:57.300 --> 42:58.608
Nothing. It's stupid.

42:58.640 --> 43:00.267
Something I thought was over.

43:00.310 --> 43:01.902
What?

43:01.940 --> 43:03.100
ANNOUNCER:
...sexual in nature,

43:03.140 --> 43:04.698
it could be misinterpreted
as such.

43:04.750 --> 43:05.842
Nothing.

43:05.880 --> 43:08.917
But unwelcome sexual conduct
can also be verbal.

43:08.950 --> 43:11.817
Good morning,
gorgeous.

43:11.850 --> 43:13.909
Even an intended compliment

43:13.950 --> 43:15.952
can create an uncomfortable
work enVIronment.
