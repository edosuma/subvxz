WEBVTT

02:19.572 --> 02:20.839
- It's a sunny day.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.175
Our summer countdown
continues as always,

02:23.177 --> 02:25.978
right here on Middleland Radio.

02:25.980 --> 02:29.014
Here's Kiss Me Fatboy,
with hot summer fun.

02:29.016 --> 02:32.084
But first, a quick
message from our sponsors.

02:34.654 --> 02:37.189
- Good morning, Teddy.

02:37.191 --> 02:39.825
OK, I know what you're thinking.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.327
Who's that grinning idiot?

02:42.329 --> 02:44.329
It's me, Pelle Nohrmann.

02:44.331 --> 02:46.064
Some people know me
as a ninth grader

02:46.066 --> 02:47.533
at Middleland High School.

02:47.535 --> 02:49.902
Others as the superhero Antboy,

02:49.904 --> 02:51.637
who protects the
innocent and cracks down

02:51.639 --> 02:54.006
on criminals.

02:54.008 --> 02:54.907
Good morning.

02:54.909 --> 02:57.176
- Good morning.

02:57.178 --> 02:58.710
How come you're in
such a good mood?

02:58.712 --> 03:00.345
- I just am.

03:00.347 --> 03:01.647
- Middleland crime rate has seen

03:01.649 --> 03:03.282
a rapid decrease
since the appearance

03:03.284 --> 03:05.784
of the superhero
Antboy, who came to town

03:05.786 --> 03:07.753
three years ago.

03:07.755 --> 03:09.955
Therefore, the township
has officially joined

03:09.957 --> 03:12.257
together with Exofarm,
in order to honor

03:12.259 --> 03:14.526
Antboy, by erecting
a statue of him.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.727
- A statue?

03:15.729 --> 03:17.529
- Well, that's a waste
of taxpayer money.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.331
- Oh, Antboy deserves
it for all his help

03:19.333 --> 03:20.866
around this city.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.568
- That's right.

03:22.570 --> 03:26.305
Three years ago, the
Flea's Hercules serum

03:26.307 --> 03:29.308
gave me superpowers.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.777
If you told me then
where I'd be today,

03:31.779 --> 03:34.046
I would have never believed you.

03:34.048 --> 03:36.582
But if there's one thing
I've learned in life,

03:36.584 --> 03:38.951
that is this.

03:38.953 --> 03:42.187
Everything can change.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.387
- Pelle, wake up.

04:15.389 --> 04:18.690
Pelle.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.963
Pelle?

04:24.965 --> 04:27.065
Are you OK?

04:27.067 --> 04:28.734
- Yeah, I think so.

04:28.736 --> 04:31.036
- You could use the door
once in a while, you know.

04:31.038 --> 04:34.239
- Did you hear about my statue?

04:36.709 --> 04:40.646
Thanks.

04:48.254 --> 04:50.088
Here.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.891
Sugar's not good for me, anyway.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.128
- Want to share mine?

04:56.130 --> 04:57.062
- What flavor?

04:57.064 --> 04:59.331
- Strawberry and rhubarb kiss.

04:59.333 --> 05:00.399
Want to try?

05:00.401 --> 05:03.135
- Thanks.

05:03.137 --> 05:05.337
Mm.

05:05.339 --> 05:07.806
- So, did you hear from
the boarding school yet?

05:07.808 --> 05:10.942
- No, not yet.

05:10.944 --> 05:11.943
And you?

05:11.945 --> 05:13.111
- Got my letter today.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.179
- What did it say?

05:14.181 --> 05:15.914
- Practical info.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.517
We're going skiing in
the second semester.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.552
Without parents.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.425
- Oh, it's just William.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.093
I bet you he just
wants me to change

05:28.095 --> 05:31.963
the batteries on the Ant Com,
I'll call him back later.

05:33.032 --> 05:35.233
- Did you tell him
about boarding school?

05:35.235 --> 05:36.268
- No.

05:36.270 --> 05:38.870
Not yet, no.

05:40.206 --> 05:41.807
- Here.

05:41.809 --> 05:42.941
- Thanks.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.376
- You're welcome.

05:44.378 --> 05:45.444
- But I already have a watch.

05:45.446 --> 05:46.878
- That's more than just a watch.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.847
It's a police radio
frequency scanner.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.682
It alerts you if
Antboy is needed.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.918
Press twice on the side
in case of emergency.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.020
Like this.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.597
That way we can always get
in touch with each other.

06:01.894 --> 06:04.830
- What is it?

06:04.832 --> 06:08.233
- It's Maria, she sent
a pic from Germany.

06:08.235 --> 06:09.534
- Bummer she had to leave, huh?

06:09.536 --> 06:11.069
- Yeah.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.338
I mean, that the Fury can't
help us catch villians here

06:13.340 --> 06:14.606
in Middleland.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.675
- Hmm.

06:18.444 --> 06:21.213
There aren't many
super villains left.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.849
Maybe there's no
need for a superhero.

06:27.820 --> 06:30.956
Ida's going away
for boarding school.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.758
- Hmm.

06:38.865 --> 06:41.800
- I've been giving
it a lot of thought.

06:41.802 --> 06:44.169
And I'm going with her.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.404
- What?

06:45.406 --> 06:47.439
- Yeah, I went to the
entry day with her,

06:47.441 --> 06:50.842
and it was super cool.

06:50.844 --> 06:54.112
You can do film, photography,
work in so many workshops,

06:54.114 --> 06:59.184
take up kayaking, fencing,
or become a glass blower.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.319
- You want to become
a glass blower?

07:01.321 --> 07:03.321
- No, I don't know what I want.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.656
I don't know what I'm good at.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.691
I really have no idea.

07:06.693 --> 07:11.763
I mean, come on, being
Antboy is all I know.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.565
I'll be back next year.

07:13.567 --> 07:14.533
- I'm going to
boarding school, too.

07:14.535 --> 07:15.901
- Huh?

07:15.903 --> 07:17.169
You never said anything.

07:17.171 --> 07:19.037
- The admission criteria
are pretty tough.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.106
So I wasn't sure I'd get in.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.442
- What school is it?

07:23.444 --> 07:27.345
- Xavier Academy, for
gifted youngsters.

07:27.347 --> 07:29.181
- That's really cool.

07:29.183 --> 07:31.750
- Yeah.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.721
Well, I gotta go.

07:36.723 --> 07:37.923
- To do what?

07:37.925 --> 07:39.357
- I have to study.

07:39.359 --> 07:40.926
- It's summer break.

07:40.928 --> 07:43.562
- I'm studying in advance.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.371
- Burglary in progress on

07:53.373 --> 07:54.706
A10 Harold Road.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.675
Any cars nearby?

08:09.155 --> 08:11.990
- All right, let's
get a move on.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.861
Hurry up.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.571
Hurry.

08:28.140 --> 08:31.142
- Monkeying around, are we?

08:33.613 --> 08:36.548
- Antboy?

08:39.385 --> 08:42.220
You better get out of here,
or face the consequences.

08:42.222 --> 08:45.423
- You couldn't find
a better costume?

08:45.425 --> 08:47.092
It's incredible that
people are still stupid

08:47.094 --> 08:48.927
enough to break the
law around here.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.662
You know I'm gonna catch you.

08:50.664 --> 08:53.365
- Let's wipe out
this little bug.

08:58.638 --> 09:00.939
What the?

09:01.841 --> 09:04.509
Huh?

09:26.399 --> 09:28.300
What?

09:43.482 --> 09:46.952
- You're too slow, Antboy.

09:49.722 --> 09:53.224
It's my turn now.

09:53.226 --> 09:56.227
- Who are you?

10:16.115 --> 10:19.517
Sweat and lemons?

10:20.920 --> 10:22.554
- Antboy seems
to be challenged by a new,

10:22.556 --> 10:24.556
unknown crime fighter.

10:24.558 --> 10:27.459
Just last night, the
unnamed hero stopped

10:27.461 --> 10:29.661
a crime from being
committed in Middleland,

10:29.663 --> 10:33.632
Vimmelstrop, and Hassleborough.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.237
- Albert Gilmalkra.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.473
You were admitted to
Dragonsport two years ago,

10:41.475 --> 10:44.476
convicted of theft, breach
of Danish air space,

10:44.478 --> 10:46.645
the abduction of
Amanda Summerstead,

10:46.647 --> 10:49.047
and William Theson.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.449
Also the extortion of
Henreich Summerstead,

10:51.451 --> 10:54.252
CEO of Exofarm and
damage to municipal

10:54.254 --> 10:56.988
property amounting
to several million.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.324
Criminal acts all
perpetrated under the alias

10:59.326 --> 11:02.527
the Flea.

11:02.529 --> 11:04.362
This committee was
assembled with the purpose

11:04.364 --> 11:08.667
to assess whether you are
ready to be discharged.

11:08.669 --> 11:11.803
What do you intend to do,
should you be released?

11:11.805 --> 11:14.606
- I've always been
very fond of plants.

11:14.608 --> 11:17.942
There is a beautiful
botanical garden in Vimstrop,

11:17.944 --> 11:20.812
maybe I could apply
for a job there.

11:20.814 --> 11:23.615
- How about your
scientific career, sir?

11:23.617 --> 11:25.483
Do you intend to finish
the research begun before

11:25.485 --> 11:27.318
your incarceration?

11:27.320 --> 11:29.654
- No, that chapter is
closed for me, sir.

11:29.656 --> 11:31.122
- How about Antboy?

11:31.124 --> 11:33.258
Do you still harbor the
same intense hatred for him

11:33.260 --> 11:34.759
as when you came here?

11:34.761 --> 11:37.162
- My dismissal from Exofarm,
and the grief over my

11:37.164 --> 11:39.397
mother's death led me astray.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.266
I've done terrible things.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.301
Things I regret bitterly today.

11:50.176 --> 11:52.243
And I don't hate Antboy.

11:52.245 --> 11:55.080
On the contrary, I'm
grateful to him for

11:55.082 --> 11:59.017
stopping me before the
Flea hurt anyone seriously.

11:59.019 --> 12:00.652
Were it not for Antboy,
I may never have

12:00.654 --> 12:03.588
mended my ways, Doctor.

12:09.829 --> 12:11.096
- So, what do you think?

12:11.098 --> 12:12.030
OK.

12:12.032 --> 12:12.897
- I think we're good to go.

12:12.899 --> 12:13.998
Do you agree?

12:14.000 --> 12:16.234
I think we are.

12:23.609 --> 12:25.276
- The committee,
hereby, finds you to be

12:25.278 --> 12:28.012
100 percent rehabilitated
and that you no longer

12:28.014 --> 12:31.449
pose a threat to Middleland.

13:21.333 --> 13:23.601
- Mr.
Albert Gilmakra?

13:23.603 --> 13:27.272
The CEO of Exofarm
wants to see you.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.207
- Tell Summerstead
I'm not interested.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.509
- Henrick
Summerstead is no longer the CEO

13:31.511 --> 13:34.112
of Exofarm.

13:38.150 --> 13:42.253
Henrick Summerstead.

13:59.805 --> 14:01.139
- Dr. Gilmakra.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.640
Welcome.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.943
My name is John Tomison, and
I am the head of security.

14:04.945 --> 14:08.313
The CEO is waiting
for you, Doctor.

14:45.284 --> 14:47.385
- Dr. Gilmakra.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.120
Welcome to Exofarm.

14:49.122 --> 14:51.756
Or rather, welcome back.

14:51.758 --> 14:56.094
I'm Alicia Duforte, the
newly appointed CEO.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.862
- And somewhat of a
globetrotter, I see.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.198
- Yes.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.967
To travel is to
live, isn't that so?

15:04.069 --> 15:08.106
- What happened to
Henrick Summerstead?

15:08.108 --> 15:09.707
- My father, Charles
Richard Duforte,

15:09.709 --> 15:12.410
bought the company while
you were in Dragonsport.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.913
And had me replace Summerstead.

15:14.915 --> 15:16.714
Summerstead tried to make
money for the company,

15:16.716 --> 15:21.786
which was important, but
money isn't everything, is it?

15:22.821 --> 15:25.056
Exofarm has a far
greater responsibility.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.025
- Which is what?

15:27.027 --> 15:29.427
- I'll show you now.

15:34.767 --> 15:39.837
This, right here, is our
new research facility.

15:41.106 --> 15:45.843
And this here is our
very latest addition.

15:49.882 --> 15:51.816
- The exoskeleton.

15:51.818 --> 15:53.484
- Yes.

15:53.486 --> 15:56.621
- It was on the drawing
board when I worked here.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.256
But Summerstead scrapped it.

15:58.258 --> 16:02.327
- Just like he did with
your Hercules serum.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.228
- Professor, Grumwinkle,
please, give our guest

16:04.230 --> 16:06.798
a demonstration.

16:10.036 --> 16:11.936
- This suit is
made from titanium,

16:11.938 --> 16:14.138
and it's controlled by
impulses from the brain

16:14.140 --> 16:15.773
to the nervous system.

16:15.775 --> 16:18.776
It's an external skeleton.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.945
- Just like in the
insect world, right?

16:20.947 --> 16:23.481
- Yes, precisely.

16:25.184 --> 16:27.418
- We can use the
exoskeleton to rehabilitate

16:27.420 --> 16:28.786
those that are disabled.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.321
It's quite helpful.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.190
People who are paralyzed
can walk again,

16:32.192 --> 16:34.926
thanks to this suit.

16:43.268 --> 16:45.670
The suit magnifies the
carrier's strength,

16:45.672 --> 16:47.872
and can be worn by
firefighters and relief workers

16:47.874 --> 16:50.208
in disaster areas.

16:51.310 --> 16:52.143
- Impressive.

16:52.145 --> 16:54.479
- It has huge potential.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.777
- I sincerely
apologize, Miss Duforte.

17:25.779 --> 17:27.979
Remote controlled receiver
is extremely sensitive

17:27.981 --> 17:31.049
to disturbances from channels
like, well, for example,

17:31.051 --> 17:33.751
mobile phones.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.319
- As long as you learn
from your mistakes,

17:35.321 --> 17:38.056
am
I right, Dr. Gilmakra?

17:38.058 --> 17:40.792
- What does all this have
to do with me, though?

17:40.794 --> 17:42.493
- Just think how many people
you could have helped,

17:42.495 --> 17:45.329
had Summerstead not
stood in your way.

17:45.331 --> 17:46.397
Hundreds.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.067
Thousands.

17:49.069 --> 17:51.335
Your mother might
have been alive today.

17:51.337 --> 17:54.172
Have you thought about that?

17:54.174 --> 17:55.540
I won't stand in
your way, Doctor.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.875
If only you'll come
back to Exofarm

17:57.877 --> 18:00.211
and recreate the
Hercules serum, which

18:00.213 --> 18:03.014
gave the Flea his powers.

18:03.016 --> 18:05.850
- And if I do, what do
you intend to use it for?

18:05.852 --> 18:07.919
- The same as you.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.755
To save the world.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.924
- Thank you for the offer,
but the Hercules serum

18:12.926 --> 18:15.860
has done far too much damage.

18:16.728 --> 18:18.963
- Please consider it, OK?

18:18.965 --> 18:22.900
I'm sure you and I could
do great things together.

18:33.245 --> 18:36.981
- Over here, over
here, pass it to me.

18:36.983 --> 18:39.150
Come on.

18:43.523 --> 18:46.390
- Hey, did you hear
about the unnamed hero?

18:46.392 --> 18:47.792
- I sure did.

18:47.794 --> 18:50.928
- I heard he was half
man and half cyborg.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.997
The government made
him, and he's got

18:52.999 --> 18:57.768
more weapons than Cable
and Deadpool combined.

18:57.770 --> 19:00.171
- OK, dude, you've
read way too many

19:00.173 --> 19:01.639
Rob Liefield comics.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.241
The unnamed hero isn't a robot.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.476
How do we even know it's a guy?

19:05.478 --> 19:08.012
It might be just a
super cool skater chick,

19:08.014 --> 19:13.084
with ninja skills like
Katana, or Electra,

19:14.219 --> 19:16.220
who's going around
wasting bad guys.

19:16.222 --> 19:18.389
- A skater chick
with ninja skills?

19:18.391 --> 19:21.325
Yeah, I don't think so,
because the crazy thing is,

19:21.327 --> 19:24.562
I saw him last night at the bog.

19:24.564 --> 19:28.666
He had horns on his head
and huge glowing eyes

19:28.668 --> 19:32.036
like Echkin the demon.

19:32.038 --> 19:33.037
- Oh, come on.

19:33.039 --> 19:34.272
Get a grip, Couisin It.

19:34.274 --> 19:38.109
He's a superhero,
not some goth demon.

19:38.111 --> 19:39.310
- He's not a superhero
if he doesn't have

19:39.312 --> 19:40.578
any super powers.

19:40.580 --> 19:41.812
- So, then Batman.

19:41.814 --> 19:42.880
He hasn't gotten
any super powers.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.048
So, what, he's not a superhero?

19:44.050 --> 19:46.050
- Don't compare him to Batman.

19:46.052 --> 19:47.685
He doesn't even have a name.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.954
How hard is it to
come up with a name?

19:49.956 --> 19:51.422
- The unnamed hero is his name.

19:51.424 --> 19:52.490
- Or hers.

19:52.492 --> 19:53.457
- What?

19:53.459 --> 19:54.792
What kind of name is that?

19:54.794 --> 19:57.662
- It's better than Antboy.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.297
- He's pathetic.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.832
- And now, please
welcome our lovely CEO,

20:01.834 --> 20:03.201
Alicia Duforte.

20:09.074 --> 20:11.475
- Thank you so, ooh.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.277
Thank you very much.

20:13.279 --> 20:16.013
It's really great to
see such a big crowd.

20:16.015 --> 20:18.416
Antboy is a symbol
of self sacrifice,

20:18.418 --> 20:19.884
and heroism.

20:19.886 --> 20:24.889
He made this town of ours
a safer place to live.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.692
Today, Exofarm would
like to give this statue

20:27.694 --> 20:31.028
in humble gratitude
for his courage.

20:31.030 --> 20:34.699
With this, we honor
Middleland's protector, Antboy.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.417
My, oh my.

20:58.790 --> 21:01.158
Yes, art has many expressions.

21:21.179 --> 21:22.280
- You've reached the voice

21:22.282 --> 21:24.081
mailbox of William Theson.

21:24.083 --> 21:27.385
Please leave a message
after the beep.

21:27.387 --> 21:29.253
- William.

21:29.255 --> 21:31.522
I have to talk to you.

21:31.524 --> 21:33.991
It's important.

21:33.993 --> 21:36.560
Call me back.

21:45.203 --> 21:47.104
William.

21:47.106 --> 21:49.840
Wait for me.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.475
Did you get my message?

21:51.477 --> 21:53.611
- I'm busy Pelle.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.079
- But we have to
find out who he is.

21:55.081 --> 21:56.347
- Who?

21:56.349 --> 21:58.416
- That idiot with
the skateboard.

21:58.418 --> 21:59.750
Doesn't he seem sketchy?

21:59.752 --> 22:02.086
- Not particularly.

22:02.088 --> 22:04.455
- You haven't seen him up close.

22:04.457 --> 22:07.224
He's really spooky.

22:07.226 --> 22:09.760
And he always
smells really weird.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.595
- Weird in what way?

22:11.597 --> 22:14.699
- Like sweat and lemons.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.133
- Sweat and lemons?

22:16.135 --> 22:18.269
- Yeah.

22:21.740 --> 22:23.574
- Use your sense of
smell to find him, then.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.976
- Come on, William, I have
to find out who he is.

22:25.978 --> 22:28.546
I really can't leave unless
I know the town is safe.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.014
- Do it.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.082
- You're the one that always
says we have to protect

22:31.084 --> 22:32.016
Middleland.

22:32.018 --> 22:32.950
- Not against other superheroes.

22:32.952 --> 22:34.518
- He's not a superhero.

22:34.520 --> 22:35.586
No super powers.

22:35.588 --> 22:36.921
No superhero.

22:36.923 --> 22:38.255
Why is it that so
hard to understand?

22:38.257 --> 22:39.957
- Oh, I get what's
going on here.

22:39.959 --> 22:42.059
You're just jealous.

22:44.497 --> 22:46.297
- Get lost, kiddies.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.900
William, my young Padawan.

22:49.902 --> 22:52.203
The new Mr. Mystic
18 inch just arrived.

22:52.205 --> 22:53.571
I put one aside for you.

22:53.573 --> 22:54.505
It's awesome.

22:54.507 --> 22:56.440
- I'm not buying today.

22:57.609 --> 23:00.111
I'm selling.

23:00.113 --> 23:02.012
- Hmm.

23:11.456 --> 23:12.757
Mm.

23:12.759 --> 23:14.625
- A comic book?

23:16.095 --> 23:19.363
- This, my ignorant friend,
isn't just a comic book.

23:19.365 --> 23:22.833
This is the first
edition Commander Combat.

23:22.835 --> 23:25.703
- I've never heard of him.

23:26.805 --> 23:28.506
- He was an American
Marine who was captured

23:28.508 --> 23:30.608
during World War Two.

23:30.610 --> 23:33.477
He befriended a Japanese
solider who trained him

23:33.479 --> 23:36.113
in the martial art, Bushido.

23:36.115 --> 23:39.850
He escaped from the POW
camp and defeated the enemy.

23:39.852 --> 23:42.887
- Only 14 issues of this
were ever published.

23:42.889 --> 23:46.223
This is number one from 1942.

23:46.225 --> 23:48.659
Extremely rare.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.795
Glowing colors.

23:50.797 --> 23:53.431
Sharp corners.

23:53.433 --> 23:57.868
And the staples are still shiny.

23:57.870 --> 24:00.271
It's in near mint condition.

24:00.273 --> 24:02.706
William, I can absolutely
find a buyer for this.

24:02.708 --> 24:06.644
But are you sure
you want to sell it?

24:06.646 --> 24:10.948
Yeah, and I want to sell the
rest of my collection, too.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.349
- What's going on?

24:12.351 --> 24:14.652
What do you want to sell
your comic books for?

24:14.654 --> 24:16.387
Is there a reason why
you won't help me find

24:16.389 --> 24:17.855
the skater geek?

24:17.857 --> 24:21.559
- I guess I've grown
too old for superheroes.

24:21.561 --> 24:25.429
- Fine, I'll find
him on my own, then.

24:30.035 --> 24:31.469
- Hmm.

24:31.471 --> 24:33.938
Beautiful.

24:35.474 --> 24:40.010
- I will find out who you
are, Tony Hawk wannabe.

24:40.012 --> 24:41.946
He smells just like my grandma.

24:41.948 --> 24:44.815
It can't be too
hard to track down.

24:46.384 --> 24:49.954
Your stench will be
easy to recognize.

24:55.894 --> 24:58.896
- Who is Middleland's
new superhero, and where

24:58.898 --> 25:00.130
did he come from?

25:00.132 --> 25:01.866
- If you aren't one of
the buff pansies that's

25:01.868 --> 25:04.168
always at the gym, then
you must be fooling around

25:04.170 --> 25:08.205
on your stupid
skateboard in the park.

25:08.207 --> 25:11.575
- Sure, some might
agree, now go away.

25:11.577 --> 25:13.477
- One thing's
definitely for sure.

25:13.479 --> 25:17.047
He must be a giant nerd.

25:20.686 --> 25:22.453
- One, two, three, four, kick.

25:22.455 --> 25:24.522
Again, and kick.

25:24.524 --> 25:27.057
- You could be anyone.

25:27.059 --> 25:28.792
But you can't hide from me.

25:28.794 --> 25:31.762
Boy or girl.

25:31.764 --> 25:35.132
Or my nose.

25:43.109 --> 25:44.642
Hi.

25:44.644 --> 25:46.176
- Hey, Pelle, I
have to buy bags for school.

25:46.178 --> 25:47.878
Let's go together.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.580
- I can't talk now.
- Why?

25:49.582 --> 25:51.849
- I can't talk.

25:51.851 --> 25:54.618
- Hello?

25:55.487 --> 25:57.288
Hello?

25:57.290 --> 25:58.622
Are you there?

25:58.624 --> 26:01.625
- I gotta go right now.

26:04.764 --> 26:06.864
- And in local
news, Albert Gilmakra,

26:06.866 --> 26:10.367
AKA the Flea, has been
released after all these years.

26:10.369 --> 26:13.237
Gilmakra used to be a
scientist at the drug company

26:13.239 --> 26:17.374
Exofarm, and was released
from psychiatric care.

26:30.121 --> 26:31.855
- How could they release him?

26:31.857 --> 26:33.223
He's insane.

26:33.225 --> 26:36.160
- My dad Gilmakra's been
to a meeting at Exofarm.

26:36.162 --> 26:38.495
But he doesn't know why.

26:38.497 --> 26:40.531
- The Flea kidnapped me
and held me captive against

26:40.533 --> 26:43.267
my will in his
disgusting basement.

26:43.269 --> 26:46.036
He's a lunatic, and he
should be locked up forever.

26:46.038 --> 26:49.039
The experience took its toll
on me and my loved ones,

26:49.041 --> 26:51.442
but I want to thank all
my followers out there.

26:51.444 --> 26:52.977
I want them to all
know that I love them,

26:52.979 --> 26:55.646
and their support
means the world to me.

26:57.949 --> 26:59.683
- Lunatic.

27:00.518 --> 27:02.920
- There he is, get him.

27:07.293 --> 27:09.827
- Lunatic.

27:12.330 --> 27:15.165
- Stop, you idiots.

27:35.520 --> 27:39.523
- Lucky for you,
it's only tomatoes.

27:43.161 --> 27:45.129
- Oh yeah?

27:45.131 --> 27:49.099
Well, lucky for you
I'm no longer the...

27:55.674 --> 27:57.107
What do you want?

27:57.109 --> 27:58.876
- To make sure the Flea doesn't
have anymore evil schemes

27:58.878 --> 27:59.810
in store.

27:59.812 --> 28:02.913
- My name is Albert Gilmakra.

28:02.915 --> 28:05.182
The Flea doesn't exist anymore.

28:05.184 --> 28:07.017
I left him behind to die
in the dark cell that you

28:07.019 --> 28:10.120
put him in, I don't want
to see either of you again.

28:10.122 --> 28:11.288
I'm rehabilitated.

28:11.290 --> 28:12.890
The doctors say so.

28:12.892 --> 28:14.725
- You may have fooled them,

28:14.727 --> 28:17.294
but you can't fool me.

28:17.296 --> 28:19.430
Why did you go to Exofarm?

28:19.432 --> 28:22.332
- None of your business.

28:22.334 --> 28:24.902
Pesky ant.

28:25.770 --> 28:27.771
Stop it.

28:27.773 --> 28:31.208
Why won't you just
leave me alone?

28:33.011 --> 28:35.312
- I'll be watching you, Flea.

28:35.314 --> 28:36.246
Careful.

28:36.248 --> 28:39.349
- That's not my name.

28:45.323 --> 28:48.392
You pesky bug.

29:11.783 --> 29:13.484
- Dr. Gilmakra.

29:13.486 --> 29:17.988
- I have decided to
accept your offer.

29:17.990 --> 29:20.524
- Great, when can you start?

29:36.609 --> 29:38.308
- He doesn't even have a name.

29:38.310 --> 29:40.310
- The unnamed hero is his name.

29:40.312 --> 29:43.046
- You're too slow, Antboy.

29:56.227 --> 29:57.961
- Is there a reason
why you won't help me find

29:57.963 --> 30:00.097
the skater geek?

30:00.099 --> 30:03.300
- I guess I've grown
too old for superheroes.

30:04.469 --> 30:05.936
- What do you want?

30:05.938 --> 30:06.970
- To make sure
the Flea doesn't have anymore

30:06.972 --> 30:08.972
evil schemes in store.

30:08.974 --> 30:11.875
- My name is Albert Gilmakra.

30:11.877 --> 30:15.112
The Flea doesn't exist anymore.

30:27.058 --> 30:32.129
You have mocked me for
the last time, pesky ant.

30:33.698 --> 30:37.134
Now I'm going to fill up my tank

30:37.136 --> 30:40.637
with your blood.

31:33.024 --> 31:36.260
- Hi, Pelle, I'm busy right now.

31:51.476 --> 31:53.977
I am the Red Fury.

31:53.979 --> 31:56.546
- Oh my God.

31:56.548 --> 31:57.781
- Hi, Pelle.

31:57.783 --> 31:59.049
- Hey.

31:59.051 --> 31:59.917
How are you?

31:59.919 --> 32:01.151
- I'm kind of busy.

32:01.153 --> 32:03.053
This place has more bad
guys than Middleland.

32:03.055 --> 32:05.055
- Oh, wow.

32:05.057 --> 32:06.957
Maria.

32:06.959 --> 32:09.026
I've been thinking.

32:09.028 --> 32:10.427
When are you coming home?

32:10.429 --> 32:12.930
- My dad's getting
tenure at the university,

32:12.932 --> 32:14.364
so I'm staying here
a while longer.

32:14.366 --> 32:15.766
- Oh.

32:15.768 --> 32:17.234
OK.

32:17.236 --> 32:18.769
- Why, what's up?

32:18.771 --> 32:23.840
- It's just, it's just...

32:24.976 --> 32:26.543
- Pelle, I've got
to run right now.

32:39.057 --> 32:41.258
- Nobody home.

32:41.260 --> 32:44.194
- William, why are you
dressed as Harry Potter?

32:44.196 --> 32:46.596
- Why are you dressed
up as your mom?

32:48.366 --> 32:49.866
And you call me a nerd.

32:49.868 --> 32:52.402
- You've got to dress
up for Halloween.

32:52.404 --> 32:56.106
We talked Maria into
dressing up as Hermoine.

33:01.045 --> 33:02.713
- No, what?

33:02.715 --> 33:03.547
Come here.

33:03.549 --> 33:05.449
- You can't catch me.

33:05.451 --> 33:07.684
- Pelle?

33:07.686 --> 33:09.152
OK.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.755
We've got sleeping bags,
alarm clocks, running shoes,

33:11.757 --> 33:12.990
and protractors.

33:12.992 --> 33:15.225
I'll buy batteries
and sticky tack.

33:15.227 --> 33:16.526
Anything else we need?

33:16.528 --> 33:18.362
- The Antboy statue
has turned out

33:18.364 --> 33:20.831
not to be so popular
among the citizens

33:20.833 --> 33:22.099
of Middleland.

33:22.101 --> 33:24.968
A group of citizens has
started a petition drive

33:24.970 --> 33:29.072
against the sculpture, which
they call an absolute disgrace.

33:29.074 --> 33:31.608
We asked the citizens of
Middleland what they think of

33:31.610 --> 33:33.110
the work of art.

33:33.112 --> 33:34.778
- It's an abomination.

33:34.780 --> 33:38.148
Quite frankly, my own
grandchild could make a much

33:38.150 --> 33:41.051
better statue than
that piece of junk.

33:41.053 --> 33:42.619
- It's ugly as hell.

33:42.621 --> 33:46.089
- I prefer a statue of the
skater, he's much cooler.

33:46.091 --> 33:47.724
- So much cooler.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.893
- It's the ugliest
thing I've ever seen.

33:49.895 --> 33:54.131
It's a disgrace,
in my opinion, yes.

33:54.133 --> 33:55.532
- Why does it matter
to you so much what

33:55.534 --> 33:58.001
other people think?

34:00.004 --> 34:02.272
They aren't talking
about you, Pelle.

34:02.274 --> 34:04.541
Just Antboy.

34:06.010 --> 34:08.612
- No, but

34:08.614 --> 34:10.480
I am Antboy, after all.

34:10.482 --> 34:12.549
- Sure, and a stupid statue.

34:12.551 --> 34:16.186
And a bunch of idiots
on TV can't change that.

34:19.424 --> 34:22.059
- No.

34:22.061 --> 34:24.428
- I can't believe we're
starting on Monday.

34:24.429 --> 34:26.862
Aren't you excited?

34:26.864 --> 34:28.431
- Yep.

34:28.434 --> 34:30.801
It will be great.

34:37.141 --> 34:38.375
- Vandal spotted at the center,

34:38.377 --> 34:41.378
will be there in
15 minutes, over.

34:56.295 --> 35:01.298
- It may be ugly, but
vandalism is still a crime.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.234
- Antboy, thank
God it's just you.

35:04.236 --> 35:05.635
- What do you mean?

35:05.637 --> 35:08.105
- I thought it was
the skater hero.

35:08.107 --> 35:10.807
- Oh, you think he's
scarier than me or what?

35:10.809 --> 35:13.543
- No, Antboy, I didn't
mean it like that at all.

35:13.545 --> 35:15.245
- You could have fooled me.

35:15.247 --> 35:18.615
- No way, you're so much
more, you're much more

35:18.617 --> 35:20.450
scary than him, for sure.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.185
And more awesome, totally.

35:22.187 --> 35:23.720
He's just so fast.

35:23.722 --> 35:25.055
And a mean fighter.

35:25.057 --> 35:26.823
I mean, he comes out of nowhere,

35:26.825 --> 35:29.459
wearing that suit of body armor.

35:29.461 --> 35:32.162
There's no way to
tell if he's a human

35:32.164 --> 35:32.863
or a robot...

35:32.865 --> 35:34.431
- OK.

35:34.433 --> 35:36.032
I get it.

35:36.034 --> 35:38.068
Just get lost before
I change my mind.

35:38.070 --> 35:40.937
- OK, thanks, see ya.

35:53.351 --> 35:58.188
- They like him better
than us, you know that?

35:59.857 --> 36:04.461
I'm Middleland's protector,
not that skater bum.

36:07.598 --> 36:11.535
But what if he isn't a villain?

36:11.537 --> 36:15.705
What if he's better
than me, and everybody

36:15.707 --> 36:18.542
forgets about Antboy?

36:24.016 --> 36:25.215
- All points
bulletin to all available

36:25.217 --> 36:27.050
units in the area, make
your way to Exofarm.

36:27.052 --> 36:29.819
There's an emergency.

36:29.821 --> 36:31.855
- Duty's calling.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.623
Thanks for the chat.

37:19.270 --> 37:22.973
- Antboy, Antboy, Antboy.

37:22.975 --> 37:24.941
We meet again.

37:24.943 --> 37:26.476
- I don't know what
you're playing at,

37:26.478 --> 37:28.278
but it ends right here.

37:28.280 --> 37:31.881
- Butt out, Antboy, and
maybe you won't get hurt.

37:31.883 --> 37:36.653
Or are you looking for
trouble, antsy pants?

37:36.655 --> 37:39.189
So, come.

37:39.191 --> 37:42.459
Show me what you've got.

38:22.266 --> 38:23.900
- Why didn't you catch them?

38:23.902 --> 38:26.169
We were this close, and
you let them get away,

38:26.171 --> 38:27.470
you stupid little fool.

38:27.472 --> 38:29.139
- It's hardly Antboy's
fault that your men

38:29.141 --> 38:30.840
have failed you.

38:30.842 --> 38:32.242
Thank you for coming.

38:32.244 --> 38:33.977
- Why were you after Gilmakra?

38:33.979 --> 38:35.445
- Because he broke
in and stole a serum

38:35.447 --> 38:37.981
that could potentially help
save thousands of lives.

38:37.983 --> 38:39.749
The Hercules serum.

38:39.751 --> 38:41.151
- Hercules?

38:41.153 --> 38:43.186
- Yes, I believed in
Gilmakra and wanted to give

38:43.188 --> 38:45.889
him a second chance,
but it turns out,

38:45.891 --> 38:49.292
I was just a pawn
in his master plan.

38:49.294 --> 38:51.127
- That serum can give
him super strength

38:51.129 --> 38:52.395
if he drinks it.

38:52.397 --> 38:53.797
- And correct.

38:53.799 --> 38:56.132
And that's why we
need you to help us.

38:56.134 --> 38:57.867
You and I,

38:57.869 --> 39:00.770
Middleland and the
entire human race,

39:00.772 --> 39:02.539
are in need of your help.

39:02.541 --> 39:05.108
You have to stop Gilmakra,
before he turns into

39:05.110 --> 39:08.211
the Flea.

39:50.755 --> 39:54.624
- Come out now, Flea.

39:54.626 --> 39:57.660
I know you're in here.

39:57.662 --> 40:00.497
- Why, of course.

40:00.499 --> 40:03.166
Of course you know that.

40:03.168 --> 40:07.737
Because you know everything
about me, don't you?

40:07.739 --> 40:11.808
But I know something
about you, too, Antboy.

40:11.810 --> 40:15.745
You aren't as
brave as you think.

40:15.747 --> 40:18.181
- I knew you hadn't changed.

40:18.183 --> 40:19.482
- Oh, but I tried to stick

40:19.484 --> 40:21.851
to the straight and narrow.

40:21.853 --> 40:24.354
Although, it's hard to be good.

40:24.356 --> 40:26.556
When everyone treats
you like you're evil.

40:26.558 --> 40:28.391
- You can't keep hiding here.

40:28.393 --> 40:30.994
- They'll never find me here.

40:30.996 --> 40:35.398
My family built this place
more than 100 years ago.

40:35.400 --> 40:40.470
It's full of secrets
that only I know of.

40:41.038 --> 40:42.472
- Where are you?

40:42.474 --> 40:45.875
- Why, I'm here.

40:45.877 --> 40:48.111
And here.

40:48.113 --> 40:50.413
And here.

40:50.415 --> 40:54.851
Where else should I be?

40:54.853 --> 40:59.022
- Dragonsborg, where you belong.

41:01.358 --> 41:05.228
Where is the Hercules serum?

41:10.067 --> 41:11.134
Give it to me.

41:11.136 --> 41:13.036
- This is the only batch.

41:13.038 --> 41:16.906
And the formula
only exists in here.

41:16.908 --> 41:19.642
I didn't take the serum
to get my powers back.

41:19.644 --> 41:20.977
I took it to ensure
that it didn't

41:20.979 --> 41:23.746
fall into the wrong hands.

41:23.748 --> 41:25.415
- What happened at Exofarm?

41:25.417 --> 41:27.250
- I had brought
Hercules back to life,

41:27.252 --> 41:30.887
and was going to inform the CEO.

41:30.889 --> 41:34.257
But then I saw something
I shouldn't have seen.

41:35.559 --> 41:38.661
- Our customers are
getting impatient, Elisha.

41:38.663 --> 41:41.030
General Barackus has
ordered 1,000 exosuits

41:41.032 --> 41:42.632
for his soldiers.

41:42.634 --> 41:44.267
Why haven't they been delivered?

41:44.269 --> 41:46.469
- The suits have a minor glitch.

41:46.471 --> 41:47.971
A very minor thing.

41:47.973 --> 41:52.008
They're a tad more expensive
than I had anticipated.

41:52.010 --> 41:53.309
- How much more expensive?

41:53.311 --> 41:54.577
- Not a whole lot.

41:54.579 --> 41:57.714
Just 3,000,000 a piece.

41:57.716 --> 41:58.715
- Danish krone?

41:58.717 --> 41:59.549
- Euros.

41:59.551 --> 42:01.251
- 3,000,000 Euros?

42:01.253 --> 42:03.386
But that's absolutely
catastrophic.

42:03.388 --> 42:04.921
I'm going to be ruined.

42:04.923 --> 42:06.155
- No, no, you're not, Father,

42:06.157 --> 42:08.057
you are not ruined,
I have something much

42:08.059 --> 42:09.792
better than the exosuits.

42:09.794 --> 42:11.828
Our customers will love it.

42:11.830 --> 42:14.264
It will make their
soldiers invincible.

42:14.266 --> 42:16.766
- You don't understand that
this company isn't just

42:16.768 --> 42:19.369
another one of
your toys, Elisha.

42:19.371 --> 42:20.603
Millions are at stake here.

42:20.605 --> 42:22.605
- Can you listen to
me, please, Dad, huh?

42:22.607 --> 42:24.574
Please, give me a chance here.

42:24.576 --> 42:27.277
- All right, fine,
go right ahead.

42:27.279 --> 42:29.679
- I hired Albert
Gilmakra to produce the

42:29.681 --> 42:33.016
Hercules serum, which
empowered the Flea.

42:33.018 --> 42:35.118
Of course, he thinks he's
going to save the world.

42:35.120 --> 42:36.419
But he isn't.

42:36.421 --> 42:38.354
He's going to make
us very, very rich.

42:40.992 --> 42:42.425
- Great, my darling.

42:42.427 --> 42:45.161
But you've got two
days, two days.

42:45.163 --> 42:48.131
If the serum isn't
ready by then, Elisha,

42:48.133 --> 42:51.267
I'll take complete
control of Exofarm.

42:51.269 --> 42:52.268
And this time I mean it.

42:52.270 --> 42:53.369
- That's fine.

42:53.371 --> 42:54.971
Fine by me.

42:54.973 --> 42:58.308
- Would you like to
speak to your mother?

42:58.310 --> 42:59.108
- Mom?

42:59.110 --> 43:00.410
Oh, no, I can't.

43:00.412 --> 43:03.146
I've got appointments
back to back today,

43:03.148 --> 43:06.316
so I'm just a little bit,
you know, busy right now.

43:06.318 --> 43:07.850
- No.

43:07.852 --> 43:09.252
Very well.

43:09.254 --> 43:12.255
- All right, see you later.

43:13.390 --> 43:15.224
- You want to use the
Hercules for warfare?

43:15.226 --> 43:16.593
- Dr. Gilmakra.

43:17.829 --> 43:20.063
Every product developed
at Exofarm can be used

43:20.065 --> 43:23.333
for warfare, including
your Hercules serum.

43:23.335 --> 43:24.968
- Hercules isn't a weapon.

43:24.970 --> 43:27.036
- I think Mr. Flea
would disagree.

43:27.872 --> 43:29.138
Where is he, anyway?

43:29.140 --> 43:31.507
He must be in there
somewhere, Mr. Flea.

43:33.211 --> 43:34.377
- You'll never get my serum.

43:34.379 --> 43:35.545
- It's not your serum.

43:35.547 --> 43:36.846
It's my serum.

43:36.848 --> 43:38.381
It belongs to Exofarm.

43:38.383 --> 43:40.149
Hand it over now,
or I'll make sure

43:40.151 --> 43:44.087
you rot your way in a
padded cell in Dragonsborg.

43:44.089 --> 43:45.888
- Never.

43:45.890 --> 43:47.256
- As you wish.

43:47.258 --> 43:49.626
Tobison.

43:51.462 --> 43:53.429
Mr. Gilmakra has something
that belongs to me

43:53.431 --> 43:55.064
or rather, to Exofarm.

43:55.066 --> 43:55.865
It's very valuable.

43:55.867 --> 43:56.799
Get it now.

43:56.801 --> 43:58.835
- With pleasure.

44:11.750 --> 44:13.616
- Were it not for
my unnamed savior,

44:13.618 --> 44:15.918
I'd have never made
it out of there alive.

44:15.920 --> 44:17.153
- Where is he now?

44:17.155 --> 44:21.691
- The unnamed hero
is long gone by now.

44:22.760 --> 44:23.960
- What was he doing there?

44:23.962 --> 44:26.129
- Looking for evidence
against Exofarm.

44:26.131 --> 44:28.865
And against me, with no doubt.

44:28.867 --> 44:31.200
- Why should I believe you?

44:31.202 --> 44:34.337
- Humans secrete certain
pheromones when they lie.

44:34.339 --> 44:37.573
Other humans can't
smell, but you can.

44:37.575 --> 44:41.044
If I were lying, your sense
of smell would tell you.

44:41.046 --> 44:44.380
- All I can smell in this
moment, is garlic and your

44:44.382 --> 44:46.449
dirty, stinky socks.

44:46.451 --> 44:49.285
That doesn't mean
you're being honest.

44:49.287 --> 44:50.920
- But what if I am?

44:50.922 --> 44:54.290
Are you willing to
take that chance?

45:11.642 --> 45:14.010
You want to use the
Hercules for warfare?

45:14.012 --> 45:15.244
- Dr. Gilmakra.

45:15.246 --> 45:18.047
Every product developed
at Exofarm can be

45:18.049 --> 45:21.050
used for warfare, including
your Hercules serum.

45:21.052 --> 45:22.585
It's not your serum.
- You'll never get

45:22.587 --> 45:23.619
my serum.

45:23.621 --> 45:24.620
- It's my serum.

45:24.622 --> 45:27.056
It belongs to Exofarm.

45:44.241 --> 45:45.875
- William?

45:45.877 --> 45:47.777
Are you there? Over.

45:47.779 --> 45:50.646
Hello?

45:50.648 --> 45:52.081
William?

45:52.083 --> 45:53.850
Answer me.

45:53.852 --> 45:57.353
I really need your help, over.

46:18.742 --> 46:20.710
William.

46:22.813 --> 46:24.046
- I know, man.

46:24.048 --> 46:26.015
I smell bad.

46:27.084 --> 46:29.819
- I've got to show
you something.

46:31.121 --> 46:32.955
- Hand it over now, or
I'll make sure you rot

46:32.957 --> 46:35.725
your life away in a padded
cell in Dragonsborg.

46:35.727 --> 46:37.326
- Never.

46:37.328 --> 46:38.561
- As you wish.

46:38.563 --> 46:41.164
Tobison.

46:41.166 --> 46:43.499
- It's a recording from
the other guy's camera.

46:43.501 --> 46:44.801
He dropped it outside Exofarm.

46:44.803 --> 46:46.335
- The other guy?

46:46.337 --> 46:49.338
You're still unable
to say his name.

46:53.043 --> 46:55.678
- What if the
recording is genuine?

46:55.680 --> 46:58.247
- Team up with the other guy.

46:58.249 --> 47:00.082
Two superheroes against
one super villain.

47:00.084 --> 47:01.784
- What super villain is that?

47:01.786 --> 47:03.119
Duforte or the Flea?

47:03.121 --> 47:04.821
- Clearly it isn't Gilmakra.

47:04.823 --> 47:06.022
People can change, you know.

47:06.024 --> 47:07.323
- I don't trust him.

47:07.325 --> 47:09.258
I don't trust that blood sucker.

47:09.260 --> 47:11.494
- The Unnamed Hero
exposed Exofarm and

47:11.496 --> 47:13.262
served the evidence on
a platter, what more

47:13.264 --> 47:14.430
do you want?

47:14.432 --> 47:17.934
- What if it's a
trick to trap me, huh?

47:17.936 --> 47:19.936
- Why don't you just
leave the criminals to him

47:19.938 --> 47:21.604
from now on?

47:21.606 --> 47:23.673
You don't want to
be Antboy, anyway.

47:23.675 --> 47:26.108
- William, I never said that.

47:26.110 --> 47:31.180
I just, I just need
to do something else.

47:31.715 --> 47:32.648
- So what?

47:32.650 --> 47:33.916
Now you're just gonna take off?

47:33.918 --> 47:36.552
- You're going away
to school, too.

47:36.554 --> 47:38.955
- No, I'm not.

47:40.023 --> 47:41.224
- What about...

47:41.226 --> 47:43.693
- Xavier's Academy
for Gifted Youngsters?

47:43.695 --> 47:45.127
- You're saying
you made it all up?

47:45.129 --> 47:46.596
- Actually, Marvel comics did.

47:46.598 --> 47:49.232
In X-Men number one.

47:51.468 --> 47:54.203
See you, Pelle.

47:54.205 --> 47:56.639
Oh, and good luck with
the glass blowing.

48:11.922 --> 48:14.357
- I know he's here.

48:17.895 --> 48:20.162
Come on, move it.

48:31.541 --> 48:33.075
We have searched the
house and scoured

48:33.077 --> 48:34.777
the entire town.

48:34.779 --> 48:36.679
Dr. Gilmakra has
simply disappeared...

48:36.681 --> 48:39.682
- I had the serum, I had it.

48:39.684 --> 48:41.083
Right here.

48:41.085 --> 48:44.220
And I want it back, understood?

48:47.325 --> 48:50.293
You idiots.

48:50.295 --> 48:53.195
Antboy said he'd find it.

48:55.098 --> 48:56.465
If you want
something done right,

48:56.467 --> 48:58.467
you have to do it yourself.

48:58.469 --> 49:00.836
Prepare the exosuit.

49:00.838 --> 49:02.238
Now.

49:02.240 --> 49:04.440
- But it isn't fully
functional yet, miss.

49:04.442 --> 49:07.743
- Do it now.

49:08.879 --> 49:12.581
It's time to lure the
heroes out of hiding.

49:41.112 --> 49:43.546
- Duforte.

49:54.691 --> 49:57.493
- I don't believe it.

50:00.063 --> 50:01.497
- Admit it, antsy pants.

50:01.499 --> 50:02.598
You're happy to see me.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.066
- You better leave this to me.

50:04.068 --> 50:06.002
It's too dangerous for amateurs.

50:06.004 --> 50:06.802
- OK.

50:06.804 --> 50:08.004
Suit yourself.

50:08.006 --> 50:09.805
- Antboy, are you in
cahoots with that crook?

50:09.807 --> 50:13.309
- I'm not in
cahoots with anyone.

50:13.311 --> 50:14.610
Especially not you.

50:14.612 --> 50:17.046
- Always the smart ass.

50:18.148 --> 50:20.783
- Who's the smart ass here?

50:20.785 --> 50:22.184
You're the smart ass.

50:22.186 --> 50:23.686
- You're the smart ass.

50:23.688 --> 50:25.855
- Wow, very mature.

50:25.857 --> 50:28.657
- Wow, very mature of you?

50:28.659 --> 50:29.925
- Seriously?

50:29.927 --> 50:31.160
- Seriously.

50:31.162 --> 50:33.062
- You're a copycat.

50:33.064 --> 50:34.563
That's all you know how to do.

50:34.565 --> 50:37.666
- Sorry, Stan Lee, I didn't
know you invented superheroes.

50:37.668 --> 50:40.269
- Hey.

50:40.271 --> 50:43.339
Hand over Gilmakra, and the
Hercules serum right now.

50:43.341 --> 50:44.874
Or I'll take this town apart.

50:44.876 --> 50:45.841
Where is it?

50:45.843 --> 50:47.676
- You won't take anything apart.

50:47.678 --> 50:49.378
It's my town.

50:49.380 --> 50:51.514
Get it?

51:04.895 --> 51:06.095
- Hello?

51:06.097 --> 51:08.397
Are you OK?

51:09.399 --> 51:11.534
Pelle?

51:28.852 --> 51:32.788
- No, don't do it.

51:35.126 --> 51:40.029
- Give me Gilmakra, or else
I'll wipe out all of Middleland.

51:40.031 --> 51:42.431
It's up to you.

51:58.882 --> 52:01.817
- William?

52:15.732 --> 52:18.534
- Shattered knee cap.

52:23.306 --> 52:25.007
Hey.

52:25.009 --> 52:26.242
- Hey.

52:26.244 --> 52:28.144
- Did you tell my mom
that I fell off my bike?

52:28.146 --> 52:30.012
- Yeah.

52:30.014 --> 52:33.215
- Good, she fusses
enough over me as it is.

52:33.217 --> 52:34.850
She can't handle the
thought of her son fighting

52:34.852 --> 52:37.987
criminals in his spare time.

52:40.090 --> 52:41.991
- Here.

52:41.993 --> 52:45.561
I told him you
changed your mind.

52:47.364 --> 52:49.665
- I did change it.

52:49.667 --> 52:51.667
- I should have recognized you.

52:51.669 --> 52:53.936
- My suit has scent
capsules that excrete

52:53.938 --> 52:55.538
a mixture of ammonia and citrus.

52:55.540 --> 52:57.039
- Sweat and lemons.

52:57.041 --> 53:01.343
- They masked my scent so
you couldn't smell it was me.

53:02.579 --> 53:06.849
- But why would you want
to keep it a secret?

53:06.851 --> 53:09.251
- That's the idea of
a secret identity.

53:09.253 --> 53:12.188
- William.

53:12.190 --> 53:15.457
- I was fed up with
being your assistant.

53:15.459 --> 53:17.927
I wanted to try myself.

53:17.929 --> 53:20.696
- Try what?

53:21.765 --> 53:24.567
- Being a real superhero.

53:26.203 --> 53:29.805
It all began long ago, on
my way home from school.

53:29.807 --> 53:32.975
Some of the big boys were
bullying a little kid.

53:32.977 --> 53:36.011
Just like when the
terror twins bullied me.

53:36.013 --> 53:37.813
I had to do something.

53:37.815 --> 53:40.749
Stop, leave him alone.

53:40.751 --> 53:42.418
But I wasn't Antboy.

53:42.420 --> 53:45.221
So I did the only thing I could.

53:45.223 --> 53:48.090
I ran.

54:03.240 --> 54:08.310
- Don't let fear get the
better of you, William.

54:18.288 --> 54:21.690
- Commander Combat?

54:21.692 --> 54:25.094
- Don't let injustice prevail.

54:25.096 --> 54:27.062
- I'm nothing like you.

54:27.064 --> 54:29.098
I can't even see properly.

54:29.100 --> 54:31.267
- To be a hero doesn't
mean not having

54:31.269 --> 54:32.935
weaknesses.

54:32.937 --> 54:36.505
But overcoming them
to help others.

54:36.507 --> 54:38.574
- Pelle's the one
with the superpowers.

54:38.576 --> 54:40.075
Not me.

54:40.077 --> 54:43.212
- Not all heroes were gifted
with their superpowers,

54:43.214 --> 54:46.915
some of us, a few of us,
became who we are through

54:46.917 --> 54:50.586
dedication and willpower.

54:52.689 --> 54:55.624
You, too, can become
a real superhero,

54:55.626 --> 54:57.526
if you really want to.

54:57.528 --> 54:59.928
You have the courage
and the heart.

54:59.930 --> 55:04.033
All you need is the rest.

55:09.072 --> 55:11.807
- From that day on, I was
through running and hiding.

55:11.809 --> 55:14.810
That day, I decided
to become the hero I'd

55:14.812 --> 55:16.545
always wanted to be.

55:16.547 --> 55:19.982
And I dedicated all my
time to becoming him.

56:38.194 --> 56:42.898
I thought I could be
like you, but I couldn't.

56:42.900 --> 56:46.201
- No, you couldn't.

56:46.203 --> 56:47.603
You were better.

56:47.605 --> 56:49.104
- I was?

56:49.106 --> 56:52.941
- Listen, if anyone asks
me, I'll deny everything.

56:52.943 --> 56:54.443
OK?

56:54.445 --> 56:57.513
But that skeeter geek was
pretty cool, even if he did

56:57.515 --> 56:58.814
have a lame name.

56:58.816 --> 56:59.882
- I know.

56:59.884 --> 57:01.350
All the good names were taken.

57:01.352 --> 57:03.719
I couldn't think of one.

57:06.423 --> 57:08.924
- How about,

57:08.926 --> 57:12.060
how about Sidekick?

57:12.062 --> 57:13.996
- Sidekick as in assistant?

57:13.998 --> 57:16.865
- No, Sidekick as
in kicking sideways,

57:16.867 --> 57:20.636
you know, like,
karate or something.

57:24.841 --> 57:26.942
Sidekick.

57:37.687 --> 57:41.223
- It doesn't matter now.

57:41.225 --> 57:43.492
- I'll make Elisia Duforte pay.

57:43.494 --> 57:45.093
- She's too strong, Pelle.

57:45.095 --> 57:47.429
Even for Antboy.

57:47.431 --> 57:51.166
If you try to stop her,
you'll end up like me.

57:51.168 --> 57:53.335
Go to boarding school with Ida.

57:53.337 --> 57:57.406
Go as far away from
Exofarm as you can.

57:59.843 --> 58:02.144
- Time is running out, Elisha.

58:02.146 --> 58:04.313
We have to act
before it's too late.

58:04.315 --> 58:06.482
Where is Dr. Gilmakra?

58:06.484 --> 58:08.317
- I'll find him, Dad.

58:08.319 --> 58:10.118
We're watching his house,
I'll have him soon.

58:10.120 --> 58:11.954
- And if you don't find him?

58:11.956 --> 58:15.157
How will you get
hold of the serum?

58:15.159 --> 58:16.692
- I said I will find him, Dad.

58:16.694 --> 58:18.227
- I hope so, my darling.

58:18.229 --> 58:21.430
Otherwise I will have
to take over Exofarm.

58:21.432 --> 58:24.967
- You won't take over
anything, old man.

58:24.969 --> 58:26.835
Exofarm is mine now.

58:26.837 --> 58:28.070
Understand?

58:28.072 --> 58:30.939
I am Exofarm.

58:30.941 --> 58:32.307
- What are you saying?

58:32.309 --> 58:33.742
- You know how I'm
going to find the serum?

58:33.744 --> 58:35.344
I'll tell you, Dad.

58:35.346 --> 58:39.348
I'm going hunting.

58:39.350 --> 58:41.283
I've hunted lions
on the Savannah.

58:41.285 --> 58:45.354
And killer whales in
the icy Disco Bay.

58:45.356 --> 58:49.658
I can track down
and kill any prey.

58:49.660 --> 58:52.494
Gilmakra is no exception.

58:52.496 --> 58:54.897
If the cripple refuses
to give me the serum,

58:54.899 --> 58:58.400
like the Flea, I'll suck
it out of his blood.

58:58.402 --> 59:02.504
Hercules will give me
unimaginable strength.

59:02.506 --> 59:05.407
That, combined with
a powerful exosuit,

59:05.409 --> 59:08.810
will make me invincible.

59:08.812 --> 59:11.813
After I've wiped out the
Antboy, and Middleland,

59:11.815 --> 59:14.316
no one, no one can stop me.

59:14.318 --> 59:18.020
Nothing, nothing can
prevent Exofarm from

59:18.022 --> 59:22.124
conquering the world
and everyone will

59:22.126 --> 59:24.259
kneel before me.

59:24.261 --> 59:27.195
- Have you gone
completely insane, child?

59:27.197 --> 59:28.430
- Goodbye, Father.

59:28.432 --> 59:31.033
- Elisha, Elisha
don't, please, Elisha.

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:07.669
- Boarding school.

01:00:07.671 --> 01:00:10.005
- I can't believe
we're starting on Monday.

01:00:10.007 --> 01:00:13.976
Aren't you excited?

01:00:13.978 --> 01:00:15.677
- You're my best
friend, William.

01:00:15.679 --> 01:00:20.282
I couldn't have done
this without you.

01:00:20.284 --> 01:00:22.217
- Team up with the other guy.

01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:25.487
Two superheros against
one super villain.

01:00:26.856 --> 01:00:29.491
- I didn't take the
serum to get my powers back.

01:00:29.493 --> 01:00:33.595
I took it to ensure it didn't
fall into the wrong hands.

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:48.810
- Hey.

01:00:54.217 --> 01:00:56.718
You aren't coming.

01:00:58.721 --> 01:01:03.725
- I have to stay and
stop Duforte, before
she hurts anyone.

01:01:15.471 --> 01:01:18.807
- Take care, and be careful.

01:01:19.942 --> 01:01:22.844
I'll wait for you.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:34.022
- Thank you so much, Ida.

01:02:40.022 --> 01:02:42.624
- So, you walked straight
into the trap, huh?

01:02:42.626 --> 01:02:44.860
Gilmakra.

01:02:50.133 --> 01:02:54.402
- On the contrary,
you walked into ours.

01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:04.980
- Duforte.

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:09.584
I've got Gilmakra, let me in.

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:23.098
- What is it?

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:24.566
Giving up already?

01:03:24.568 --> 01:03:25.867
- What do you mean, already?

01:03:25.869 --> 01:03:27.569
I can't walk.

01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:29.871
Remember what I said.

01:03:29.873 --> 01:03:33.475
Being a hero doesn't mean
having no weaknesses.

01:03:33.477 --> 01:03:34.876
- I'm no hero.

01:03:34.878 --> 01:03:36.211
- Sure you are.

01:03:36.213 --> 01:03:38.680
You're the villain's
worst nightmare.

01:03:38.682 --> 01:03:42.217
And when you get done
whining, Middleland needs you.

01:03:42.219 --> 01:03:45.520
And so does Pelle.

01:04:16.086 --> 01:04:18.420
- The mating song of
the humpback whales.

01:04:18.422 --> 01:04:22.390
I recorded it last summer
in Alaska on an expedition.

01:04:22.392 --> 01:04:25.961
Just before I harpooned them.

01:04:25.963 --> 01:04:30.799
I find it to be extremely
soothing, don't you?

01:04:30.801 --> 01:04:33.535
- Not really.

01:04:33.537 --> 01:04:35.270
- I'm sorry about
your little friend.

01:04:35.272 --> 01:04:37.305
But all's well that
ends well, right?

01:04:37.307 --> 01:04:39.341
I promise you that when I'm
finished with the doctor,

01:04:39.343 --> 01:04:44.379
he's off to Dragonsborg
for a very long time.

01:04:49.519 --> 01:04:52.387
Get him.

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:46.968
- Hello, William.

01:06:54.377 --> 01:06:56.411
This syringe is a
concentrated dose

01:06:56.413 --> 01:06:58.179
of the Hercules serum.

01:06:58.181 --> 01:07:01.182
It will work in your
body within minutes.

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:05.053
Antboy sent me in
here to give you this.

01:07:05.055 --> 01:07:07.589
He's got a plan.

01:07:07.591 --> 01:07:10.325
But he's going to need our help.

01:07:10.327 --> 01:07:11.726
- What?

01:07:11.728 --> 01:07:14.129
- I hate Antboy.

01:07:14.131 --> 01:07:16.898
But I hate Duforte even more.

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:19.601
And right now, that
pesky little ant is the

01:07:19.603 --> 01:07:22.971
only one who can stop her.

01:07:42.793 --> 01:07:44.759
- I saved a place
for you, Antboy.

01:07:44.761 --> 01:07:46.628
A place in my office.

01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:50.165
I'll put you among all
of my other trophies.

01:08:08.317 --> 01:08:11.686
- Come on, come on.

01:08:11.688 --> 01:08:14.722
- Think you can escape?

01:08:46.188 --> 01:08:50.591
- I'll take the next one.

01:09:17.118 --> 01:09:19.587
- A scrawny, pesky ant
like you doesn't stand

01:09:19.589 --> 01:09:22.557
a chance against me.

01:09:35.069 --> 01:09:37.604
- Whoa.

01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:43.745
Hello, Top Gear, slow down.

01:09:43.747 --> 01:09:46.413
This isn't Grand Theft Auto.

01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:49.617
OK, fine, go faster then.

01:10:26.589 --> 01:10:29.457
- Do you seriously
think you can escape me?

01:10:29.459 --> 01:10:32.460
- I'm not trying to escape.

01:10:32.462 --> 01:10:34.662
I'm waiting.

01:10:34.664 --> 01:10:36.397
- For what?

01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:38.600
- Do it.

01:10:42.504 --> 01:10:45.006
- Backup.

01:10:50.279 --> 01:10:51.946
- The Unnamed Hero?

01:10:51.948 --> 01:10:53.014
- I've got a name.

01:10:53.016 --> 01:10:54.349
Sidekick.

01:10:56.052 --> 01:10:59.287
- That's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:28.182
- Duforte.

01:11:40.696 --> 01:11:41.963
- Antboy.

01:11:41.965 --> 01:11:44.198
- Gilmakra, I don't
want to rush you,

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:47.435
but she's too strong.

01:11:47.437 --> 01:11:48.736
- I'm thinking.

01:11:48.738 --> 01:11:51.572
- OK, don't let me
disturb you, then.

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:55.610
- Disturb, that's it.

01:11:55.612 --> 01:11:57.078
- What's it?

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.781
- The armor's control
system can't handle any form

01:11:59.783 --> 01:12:02.016
of disturbance
from other signal.

01:12:02.018 --> 01:12:05.753
The receiver is located
right around the neck.

01:12:05.755 --> 01:12:07.422
If you turn it off,
we might gain control.

01:12:07.424 --> 01:12:09.490
- OK.

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:24.505
- Pelle, help.

01:12:33.849 --> 01:12:35.983
- Change the remote frequency.

01:12:35.985 --> 01:12:39.020
- OK, I got it.

01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:57.905
- Stop it, stop it.

01:12:57.907 --> 01:13:00.475
- She's doing the robot.

01:13:00.477 --> 01:13:01.776
- This is annoying.

01:13:01.778 --> 01:13:05.046
Stop it.

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:10.017
- OK.

01:13:10.019 --> 01:13:13.488
- Stop it.

01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:17.325
I said stop that now or else.

01:13:19.461 --> 01:13:22.029
Let go of me.

01:13:24.867 --> 01:13:28.803
I'm Elisha Duforte, let go.

01:13:30.639 --> 01:13:32.807
Let go of me.

01:13:32.809 --> 01:13:33.775
- Ida.

01:13:33.777 --> 01:13:35.243
Everyone's looking.

01:13:35.245 --> 01:13:36.911
- Oh, that's right.

01:13:36.913 --> 01:13:37.979
- Antboy.

01:13:37.981 --> 01:13:41.582
Where's the Flea now?

01:13:41.584 --> 01:13:43.284
- His name isn't the Flea.

01:13:43.286 --> 01:13:44.986
It's Albert Gilmakra.

01:13:44.988 --> 01:13:47.355
And without him, we'd
never have stopped

01:13:47.357 --> 01:13:48.589
Elisha Duforte.

01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:50.825
We owe him all our gratitude.

01:13:50.827 --> 01:13:53.361
And not only him.

01:13:54.696 --> 01:13:58.032
- Antboy, Antboy, how did
the Flea stop Duforte?

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:02.403
- The Unnamed Hero.

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:52.053
- Pelle Norman and
William Theson.

01:14:52.055 --> 01:14:54.021
To what do I owe
this dubious honor?

01:14:54.023 --> 01:14:56.924
- I just came to say
goodbye before I leave.

01:14:56.926 --> 01:14:58.326
- To where?

01:14:58.328 --> 01:15:00.361
- For boarding school.

01:15:00.363 --> 01:15:02.797
- And what about Antboy, hmm?

01:15:02.799 --> 01:15:04.699
Who's going to protect
the town, now that

01:15:04.701 --> 01:15:05.900
the Flea's on the loose?

01:15:05.902 --> 01:15:07.134
- Sidekick will take
good care of Middleland,

01:15:07.136 --> 01:15:08.236
don't you worry.

01:15:08.238 --> 01:15:11.572
Until Antboy returns.

01:15:11.574 --> 01:15:14.141
- I heard what you
said outside Exofarm.

01:15:14.143 --> 01:15:16.244
- You deserve a second chance.

01:15:16.246 --> 01:15:18.479
- That's kind of you, but
I doubt that'll happen.

01:15:18.481 --> 01:15:20.081
This town will never be
able to forgive me for

01:15:20.083 --> 01:15:22.149
what I've done.

01:15:22.151 --> 01:15:23.818
- Don't be so sure about that.

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:27.121
- Exofarm hired Ida's once
again Dad to be the new CEO.

01:15:27.123 --> 01:15:29.056
- Yeah, and the first item
on the agenda is to get

01:15:29.058 --> 01:15:31.592
Albert Gilmakra back on board.

01:15:31.594 --> 01:15:33.928
- Well, how about that?

01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:35.897
A couple of days ago
I'd have sworn I'd never

01:15:35.899 --> 01:15:38.366
work for Summerstead again.

01:15:38.368 --> 01:15:40.535
And now, maybe, it
can be a new beginning

01:15:40.537 --> 01:15:42.336
for both of us.

01:15:42.338 --> 01:15:44.672
- For all of us.

01:15:50.412 --> 01:15:52.914
It looks different than before.

01:15:52.916 --> 01:15:55.016
- Yes.

01:15:55.018 --> 01:15:58.219
I got a little bit of help.

01:16:05.894 --> 01:16:07.562
- Better late than never.

01:16:07.564 --> 01:16:10.064
- Maria.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.668
What are you doing here?

01:16:13.670 --> 01:16:15.202
- Summerstead hired my dad,

01:16:15.204 --> 01:16:18.339
we're moving back to Middleland.

01:16:26.014 --> 01:16:29.817
- Well, I guess I
better get going.

01:16:29.819 --> 01:16:32.219
- Before you go, I want
to show you all something.

01:16:32.221 --> 01:16:35.556
That will always be
here when you need it.

01:16:36.692 --> 01:16:40.094
As I said, this place is
full of little secrets.

01:16:40.096 --> 01:16:44.065
And it would be foolish of me
not to take advantage of them.

01:16:58.947 --> 01:17:01.616
- What is this place?

01:17:01.618 --> 01:17:03.217
- I've been told
that all superheroes

01:17:03.219 --> 01:17:06.520
need a secret headquarters.

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:19.300
Welcome to the anthill.

01:17:28.043 --> 01:17:32.513
We'll protect Middleland for
you while you're away, Pelle.

01:18:07.916 --> 01:18:11.318
- I know what you're thinking.

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:15.022
Is this really the way it ends?

01:18:15.024 --> 01:18:19.193
Heroes and villains,
side by side?

01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:22.329
If you told me a week ago,

01:18:22.331 --> 01:18:24.932
I probably wouldn't believe it.

01:18:24.934 --> 01:18:26.934
But if there's one
thing I've learned,

01:18:26.936 --> 01:18:31.205
it's that everything can change.

01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:33.607
People, too.

01:18:33.609 --> 01:18:37.878
If you let them, they
can surprise you.

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:41.415
And themselves.

01:18:59.334 --> 01:19:03.504
Besides, this isn't
exactly the end.

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:07.508
It's actually the beginning.
