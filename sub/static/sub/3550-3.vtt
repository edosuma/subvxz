WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:05.136
I'M GETTING MARRIED,
AND I DON'T WANNA SCREW IT UP,

00:05.136 --> 00:08.779
'CAUSE ENOUGH OF THOSE SCREWUPS,
AND YOU JUST END UP ALONE.

00:08.779 --> 00:10.781
GABY DISCOVERED
THAT OLD FLAMES...

00:10.781 --> 00:12.283
YEAH, THAT CAN HAPPEN.

00:12.283 --> 00:14.585
CAN LEAVE EMBERS.

00:14.585 --> 00:16.787
DO YOU AT LEAST KNOW
 WHY HE STEALS?

00:16.787 --> 00:20.020
I STEAL TO HURT YOU.
 BREE'S TORTURED MARRIAGE...

00:20.020 --> 00:22.593
I'M NOT YOUR WIFE ANYMORE,
ORSON. I'M YOUR CAPTIVE.

00:22.593 --> 00:24.495
DON'T YOU FEEL ANY REMORSE
AT ALL OVER THAT?

00:24.495 --> 00:27.128
GUILT IS A SMALL PRICE
TO PAY FOR HAPPINESS.

00:27.128 --> 00:29.760
LED HER INTO AN AFFAIR
WITH KARL.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.762
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE GOOD GIRL?

00:31.762 --> 00:34.565
SHE DECIDED GUILT'S A SMALL
PRICE TO PAY FOR HAPPINESS.

00:34.565 --> 00:37.268
LYNETTE REVEALED
A CLOSELY GUARDED SECRET.

00:37.268 --> 00:39.270
NO ONE ELSE CAN KNOW
ABOUT THIS.

00:39.270 --> 00:40.671
I'M PREGNANT.

00:40.671 --> 00:43.043
YOU ARE?

00:43.043 --> 00:44.675
SOMETHING'S HAPPENED TO JULIE.

00:44.675 --> 00:46.577
AND WHEN A CRIME
WAS COMMITTED...

00:46.577 --> 00:48.779
HOW DOES A FISH GET CAUGHT?
 HE OPENS HIS MOUTH.

00:48.779 --> 00:52.083
A SUSPECT EMERGED.

01:00.561 --> 01:03.063
(Mary Alice)
THERE'S A CERTAIN KIND OF WOMAN

01:03.063 --> 01:05.296
YOU SEE IN THE SUBURBS.

01:05.296 --> 01:09.470
SHE WAITS FOR THE SCHOOL BUS
IN HER BATHROBE.

01:09.470 --> 01:15.406
SHE STOPS BY THE POST OFFICE
WITH CURLERS IN HER HAIR.

01:15.406 --> 01:20.851
SHE GOES TO THE MARKET
IN SWEATPANTS AND A T-SHIRT.

01:20.851 --> 01:23.614
THIS WOMAN IS A HOUSEWIFE,

01:23.614 --> 01:26.717
AND SHE DOESN'T BOTHER
TRYING TO BE BEAUTIFUL

01:26.717 --> 01:27.818
BECAUSE...

01:27.818 --> 01:29.360
(gasps)

01:29.360 --> 01:31.262
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.

01:31.262 --> 01:33.364
I WAS TRYING TO HIT CELIA.

01:33.364 --> 01:35.526
WELL, GET BETTER AIM!

01:35.526 --> 01:38.799
ANA, HELP ME
CLEAN THIS MESS.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.502
(sighs) DON'T UP YOUR VOLUME
ON ME.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.174
JUANITA,
FINISH THOSE VEGETABLES.

01:43.174 --> 01:45.176
DON'T MAKE ME COUNT TO THREE.

01:47.238 --> 01:49.710
OH, DON'T GIVE ME THAT LOOK,
YOU SAWED OFF LITTLE--

01:49.710 --> 01:51.712
GABY?

01:53.714 --> 01:55.586
OH, MY GOD.

01:55.586 --> 01:57.418
JOHN. HI.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.690
WOW. WHAT A SURPRISE.

01:59.690 --> 02:01.792
I WAS SO BUSY
BACK IN THE KITCHEN

02:01.792 --> 02:03.794
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU GUYS WERE HERE.

02:03.794 --> 02:05.896
HOW ARE YOU?
 WELL, I'M USUALLY BETTER

02:05.896 --> 02:08.729
WHEN I DON'T HAVE
CREAMED SPINACH ALL OVER ME.

02:08.729 --> 02:11.562
UH, SO...
ARE YOU WORKING HERE?

02:11.562 --> 02:14.235
HEY, NOTHING WRONG
WITH WAITIN' TABLES.

02:14.235 --> 02:16.237
COULD YOU GET US
SOME MORE BREAD?

02:16.237 --> 02:19.240
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I COULD BRING
YOU SOME DESSERT ON THE HOUSE.

02:19.240 --> 02:22.513
I'LL JUST GO ASK THE OWNER.
OH, WAIT. THAT'S ME.

02:24.215 --> 02:26.317
HONESTLY?
YOU OWN THIS PLACE?

02:26.317 --> 02:29.250
I BOUGHT IT WITH THE MONEY I GOT
IN MY DIVORCE SETTLEMENT.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.582
REALLY? YOU'RE DIVORCED?

02:31.582 --> 02:34.185
YEP. ALMOST A YEAR NOW.

02:34.185 --> 02:36.727
OH, MY GOD.
ARE--ARE THESE YOUR KIDS?

02:36.727 --> 02:40.261
YEAH. THIS IS CELIA AND JUANITA,
AND THIS IS OUR NIECE ANA.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.692
HELLO.

02:41.692 --> 02:43.394
HI.

02:43.394 --> 02:45.666
I CAN SEE
THE FAMILY RESEMBLANCE.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.738
SHE'S MY NIECE.

02:47.738 --> 02:49.270
WOW.

02:49.270 --> 02:53.344
IT MUST'VE BEEN A WINDY DAY WHEN
THE APPLE FELL FROM THAT TREE.

02:55.206 --> 02:57.848
WELL, IT WAS--IT WAS GREAT
SEEING YOU AGAIN.

02:57.848 --> 02:59.710
YOU, TOO. (chuckles)

02:59.710 --> 03:02.553
STILL DON'T SEE
ANY BREAD HERE.

03:02.553 --> 03:04.655
(sighs)

03:04.655 --> 03:08.219
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

03:08.219 --> 03:09.590
YES,

03:09.590 --> 03:13.964
THERE'S A CERTAIN KIND OF WOMAN
YOU ONLY MEET IN THE SUBURBS.

03:13.964 --> 03:16.797
SHE WILL TRY TO LOOK BEAUTIFUL

03:16.797 --> 03:20.501
IF SHE HAS SOMEONE
TO LOOK BEAUTIFUL FOR.

03:31.782 --> 03:34.445
(coffee gurgling)

03:34.445 --> 03:35.916
ON THIS STREET,

03:35.916 --> 03:39.590
THE DAY BEGINS
WITH A CUP OF COFFEE.

03:39.590 --> 03:42.453
MOST NEED IT TO WAKE UP.

03:42.453 --> 03:47.358
SOME CAN'T READ
THEIR MORNING PAPER WITHOUT IT.

03:47.358 --> 03:51.632
A FEW LIKE TO DRINK IT
ON THEIR WAY TO WORK.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.634
THEN THERE ARE THOSE

03:53.634 --> 03:56.407
WHO JUST WANT SOMETHING
TO HOLD IN THEIR HANDS

03:56.407 --> 03:58.469
WHILE THEY DISCUSS
THE NEIGHBORS.

03:58.469 --> 04:00.541
WELL, DANNY HAD ME FOOLED.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.543
HE SEEMED LIKE
A PRETTY NICE KID.

04:02.543 --> 04:05.446
YEAH, EXCEPT FOR THE STRANGLING.
(chuckles)

04:05.446 --> 04:09.280
SORRY.
 OH, IT'S OKAY. I'M JUST HAPPY
THAT JULIE'S SAFE

04:09.280 --> 04:10.921
AND THEY CAUGHT THE GUY.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.786
UH, SUSAN.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.762
(speaking inaudibly)

04:26.767 --> 04:28.599
BOB.

04:28.599 --> 04:30.571
GO INSIDE.

04:30.571 --> 04:31.872
GO INSIDE.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.876
HEY, SUSAN.
 I'M CONFUSED.
THE--THE LAST I HEARD,

04:35.876 --> 04:39.310
THE POLICE HAD DANNY BOLEN
IN CUSTODY.
 DANNY WAS NEVER UNDER ARREST.

04:39.310 --> 04:41.552
THE POLICE
WERE QUESTIONING HIM,

04:41.552 --> 04:44.785
BUT THEY HAD NO GROUNDS
TO HOLD HIM.
 OKAY, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
HIS LAWYER TALKING.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.588
ARE YOU HIS LAWYER?
 SUSAN, YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I LOVE JULIE,

04:47.588 --> 04:50.461
BUT THEY HAVE NO EVIDENCE
AGAINST THIS KID,

04:50.461 --> 04:53.524
AND I COULDN'T JUST
LET HIM SIT THERE.
 IF HE DIDN'T DO IT, WHY WOULD
NEED TO FAKE HIS ALIBI?

04:53.524 --> 04:56.527
BECAUSE HE'S A KID
AND HE WAS SCARED.
 ANGIE, THIS IS NOT
A GOOD IDEA.

04:56.527 --> 04:59.299
I-I JUST GOTTA SAY THIS.
SUSAN, PLEASE.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.672
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH.

05:01.672 --> 05:04.575
I AM BEGGING YOU,
AS MY FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR,

05:04.575 --> 05:06.907
DON'T DEFEND HIM.

05:06.907 --> 05:09.910
SUSAN, IT'S MY JOB.

05:09.910 --> 05:13.614
THEN I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.315
SUSAN, WAIT.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.488
COME ON. CAN--CAN WE PLEASE
JUST TALK ABOUT THIS?

05:17.488 --> 05:19.490
WE CAN GO INSIDE,
JUST THE TWO OF US.

05:19.490 --> 05:20.651
NO.

05:20.651 --> 05:23.494
YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT THIS?

05:23.494 --> 05:26.326
LET'S DO IT OUT HERE
IN THE OPEN. HEY, EVERYBODY!

05:26.326 --> 05:29.099
HER SON TRIED TO KILL
MY DAUGHTER.

05:29.099 --> 05:32.332
AND WHILE HE'S HERE,
NOBODY ON THIS STREET IS SAFE.

05:42.913 --> 05:44.415
WHAT IS THIS?

05:44.415 --> 05:45.946
BACON AND CHEESE BURRITO.

05:47.448 --> 05:50.120
YOU COULDN'T FIND ANY CROISSANTS
OR PAIN AU CHOCOLAT?

05:50.120 --> 05:52.923
SWEETIE, WE'RE AT A MOTOR LODGE
ON THE INTERSTATE.

05:52.923 --> 05:54.925
I WAS LUCKY TO FIND
A BURRITO.

05:54.925 --> 05:57.388
PEOPLE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT
THE MORAL HAZARDS OF CHEATING.

05:57.388 --> 06:00.090
NO ONE WARNS YOU
ABOUT THE FOOD.

06:00.090 --> 06:01.562
(laughs)

06:01.562 --> 06:03.564
(chuckles)

06:03.564 --> 06:05.065
MMM.
 MMM.

06:05.065 --> 06:09.570
SO YOU WANT ME TO BOOK
THIS PLACE FOR TOMORROW?
 MM, SORRY, I HAVE AN EVENT.

06:09.570 --> 06:12.072
OH, WAIT. YOU KNOW,
I THINK I DO, TOO.
 (chuckles)

06:12.072 --> 06:15.846
HOW'S THIS THEN? WE'LL GO
TO VEGAS FOR THE WEEKEND?

06:15.846 --> 06:17.147
LAS VEGAS?

06:17.147 --> 06:18.479
WHY NOT?

06:18.479 --> 06:20.481
I'LL LOSE MY SHIRT
IN THE CASINO,

06:20.481 --> 06:23.984
AND THEN WE'LL HEAD UPSTAIRS,
AND YOU CAN LOSE YOURS.

06:23.984 --> 06:26.487
I CAN'T DISAPPEAR
FOR A WHOLE WEEKEND.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.919
MY HUSBAND WOULD NOTICE.
 SAY YOU'RE VISITING FAMILY.

06:28.919 --> 06:29.920
(giggles) KARL!
 (chuckles)

06:32.523 --> 06:36.467
I'M SORRY, BUT I DON'T SEE US
HAVING ROMANTIC GETAWAYS.

06:39.029 --> 06:41.031
THAT'S THE SORT OF THING

06:41.031 --> 06:44.034
A WOMAN DOES
WITH A MAN SHE'S IN LOVE WITH.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.909
AND WE DON'T HAVE THOSE KINDS
OF FEELINGS. I GET IT.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.911
BUT YOU ARE
A DELIGHTFUL DIVERSION.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.913
AND IN ORDER
TO KEEP THINGS DELIGHTFUL,

06:52.913 --> 06:54.585
I THINK IT'S BEST

06:54.585 --> 06:56.647
WE NOT PUT UNREASONABLE DEMANDS
ON EACH OTHER.

06:56.647 --> 06:58.118
OKAY. FINE.

07:01.822 --> 07:04.194
YOU COULD'VE SAID,
"PASS THE SUGAR."

07:04.194 --> 07:08.128
I DIDN'T WANT
TO MAKE A DEMAND.

07:09.860 --> 07:12.102
SO... I KNOW YOU GUYS
HAVE BEEN CONCERNED

07:12.102 --> 07:14.104
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN SO SICK
IN THE MORNINGS.

07:14.104 --> 07:17.538
WELL, I WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW WHY.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.640
I'M PREGNANT WITH TWINS.

07:24.475 --> 07:28.048
WELL, NOW THAT THE CELEBRATION'S
OVER, ANY QUESTIONS?

07:28.048 --> 07:31.482
YEAH. AREN'T YOU GONNA BE,
LIKE, THE WORLD'S OLDEST MOM?

07:31.482 --> 07:35.025
NO. THERE'S A WOMAN IN MONGOLIA
WHO'S GOT ME BEAT.

07:35.025 --> 07:36.887
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

07:36.887 --> 07:39.960
I HAVE MORE OF A STATEMENT.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.163
YOU TWO ARE SO IRRESPONSIBLE.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.866
YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN
USING BIRTH CONTROL.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.868
YOU'RE IN COLLEGE.

07:47.868 --> 07:50.701
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE ODDS
ARE NOW THAT YOU'LL GRADUATE?

07:50.701 --> 07:53.003
LIKE, ZERO.

07:53.003 --> 07:55.906
YOU--YOU HAVE A NEW JOB,
ONE THAT YOU'LL HAVE TO QUIT

07:55.906 --> 07:58.649
ONCE THE BABY COMES.
SO I HOPE YOU'RE BOTH HAPPY.

07:58.649 --> 08:00.681
YOU'VE JUST DESTROYED
YOUR FUTURES

08:00.681 --> 08:02.713
FOR A FEW MINUTES OF PLEASURE.

08:05.516 --> 08:09.620
NOT TO MENTION, IT'S SO GROSS
YOU'RE STILL DOING IT.

08:13.794 --> 08:16.627
PENNY, YOU'RE EXCITED
ABOUT THIS, RIGHT?

08:16.627 --> 08:19.530
YEAH, GETTING TWO LITTLE BABIES
TO PLAY WITH.

08:19.530 --> 08:24.104
IF THEY'RE BOYS,
I'M OUTTA HERE.

08:27.838 --> 08:29.840
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,

08:29.840 --> 08:31.842
EVEN THOUGH
THEY'VE RELEASED DANNY,

08:31.842 --> 08:34.144
IT DOESN'T MEAN
HE'S NOT STILL A SUSPECT.

08:34.144 --> 08:35.816
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

08:35.816 --> 08:38.849
WELL, THE POLICE ARE GONNA START
DIGGING INTO YOUR BACKGROUND,

08:38.849 --> 08:41.552
SO I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA FIND.

08:41.552 --> 08:43.823
YOU'RE FROM NEW YORK, RIGHT?

08:43.823 --> 08:45.055
YEAH.

08:45.055 --> 08:48.058
BUT INSTEAD OF WASTING YOUR TIME
POKING AROUND IN THE PAST,

08:48.058 --> 08:50.060
YOU JUST NEED
TO BACK UP DANNY'S STORY.

08:50.060 --> 08:53.604
RIGHT, JUST CHECK OUT THE LIQUOR
STORES, SEE IF ANYONE SAW HIM.
 I WILL,

08:53.604 --> 08:55.766
BUT THE POLICE ARE GONNA TALK TO
PEOPLE IN YOUR OLD NEIGHBORHOOD,

08:55.766 --> 08:58.839
SEE IF HE'S GOT ANY RUN-INS
WITH THE LAW, WITH GIRLS.

08:58.839 --> 09:02.312
IS THERE ANYTHING
I NEED TO KNOW, DANNY?
 (Nick) NOPE.

09:02.312 --> 09:03.974
NOT A THING.

09:05.946 --> 09:09.950
OKAY... BUT I STILL NEED
TO ESTABLISH CHARACTER.

09:09.950 --> 09:13.123
SO I'LL NEED TO GET IN TOUCH
WITH SOME OLD TEACHERS, FRIENDS.

09:13.123 --> 09:16.827
NAH, YOU DON'T NEED
TO DO ALL THAT.

09:16.827 --> 09:19.329
LOOK,
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

09:19.329 --> 09:21.832
I CAN'T DEFEND A CLIENT
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.

09:21.832 --> 09:24.334
WHY CAN'T YOU ANSWER
JUST A FEW SIMPLE QUESTIONS?

09:24.334 --> 09:26.837
YOU WANNA KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE THIS FAMILY HAS SECRETS!

09:26.837 --> 09:27.938
DANNY.

09:27.938 --> 09:29.940
BIG DARK SECRETS
THAT WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT,

09:29.940 --> 09:31.942
NOT EVEN TO OUR LAWYER.

09:31.942 --> 09:36.647
YOU KNOW, WHO CARES IF IT MAKES
ME LOOK GUILTY, EVEN IF I'M NOT?
 KNOCK IT OFF!

09:36.647 --> 09:38.248
(door closes)

09:40.751 --> 09:43.614
THIS CONVERSATION
WAS PRIVILEGED, RIGHT?

09:58.929 --> 10:00.931
(Susan) SO I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU HEARD,

10:00.931 --> 10:02.933
BUT THIS MORNING
THE POLICE RELEASED DANNY BOLEN.

10:02.933 --> 10:06.376
I HEARD.
YOU MUST BE WORRIED SICK.
 I AM.

10:06.376 --> 10:08.879
(sighs) CLEARLY, HE'S UNSTABLE.
WHO KNOWS WHAT HE MIGHT DO NEXT?

10:08.879 --> 10:11.041
SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA
DO ABOUT IT?

10:11.041 --> 10:13.744
YOU EVER HEAR ABOUT
THAT OLD MAN ON MAPLE DRIVE?

10:13.744 --> 10:16.747
PEOPLE FOUND OUT HE USED TO BE
AN ACCOUNTANT FOR THE NAZIS,

10:16.747 --> 10:19.249
AND THEY THREW GARBAGE
ALL OVER HIS YARD.

10:19.249 --> 10:21.852
THAT'S RIGHT. AND HE MOVED.

10:21.852 --> 10:23.694
BUT THEN IT WAS BOUGHT

10:23.694 --> 10:25.726
BY SOME EX-HIPPIE
WHO PAINTED THE HOUSE PINK,

10:25.726 --> 10:27.728
SO IT WAS A PYRRHIC VICTORY
AT BEST.

10:27.728 --> 10:30.030
WELL, LOOK,
I'M JUST BRINGING THIS UP

10:30.030 --> 10:32.362
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT PEOPLE
ON THIS STREET

10:32.362 --> 10:34.835
THINKING THAT THEY'RE SAFE
WHEN THEY'RE NOT.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.366
SUSAN.

10:36.366 --> 10:39.139
HEY, UH, COULD YOU
GIVE ME A HAND FOR A SEC?

10:42.642 --> 10:45.716
(lowered voice)
HONEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:45.716 --> 10:48.819
MONA CLARKE'S GOT A BIG MOUTH.
IF YOU GET HER WORKED UP,

10:48.819 --> 10:51.281
SHE'S GONNA TALK ABOUT DANNY TO
EVERYBODY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

10:51.281 --> 10:55.125
SO?
 SO WE DON'T WANT AN ANGRY MOB
SHOWING UP AT THE BOLENS' HOUSE,

10:55.125 --> 10:57.127
ESPECIALLY IF
WE AREN'T EVEN SURE

10:57.127 --> 10:59.189
DANNY'S THE ONE
THAT ATTACKED JULIE.

10:59.189 --> 11:01.161
HE LIED ABOUT HIS ALIBI.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.363

11:03.363 --> 11:04.865
WELL...

11:04.865 --> 11:06.336

GETS ATTACKED,

11:10.340 --> 11:13.043

 OKAY. OKAY, I GET IT.

BUT GIVEN OUR HISTORY,

11:58.418 --> 12:01.992

UNCOMFORTABLE.

"GIVEN OUR HISTORY"

12:15.836 --> 12:18.108

"I BANGED YOUR WIFE"?

12:19.970 --> 12:22.742

I HAVEN'T FORGIVEN YOU.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.245

14:59.399 --> 15:02.402

 OH, SO YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE

WITH HIS MEETING YET?

22:11.931 --> 22:13.903
I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

22:13.903 --> 22:15.405
GOT A SEC?

22:15.405 --> 22:17.537
NEVER MIND.

22:21.441 --> 22:22.912
SOMETHING WRONG?

22:22.912 --> 22:24.414
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE

22:24.414 --> 22:26.916
A PARKING SPACE
CLOSER TO THE ENTRANCE?

22:26.916 --> 22:30.380
I'D LOVE IT.
YOU CLOSED THE DOOR FOR THAT?
 NO, I CLOSED THE DOOR

22:30.380 --> 22:33.383
TO ASK IF YOU WOULD LIKE
TO BE MY NEW SENIOR V.P.

22:33.383 --> 22:36.355
SERIOUSLY?

22:36.355 --> 22:39.829
OH... GOD.

22:39.829 --> 22:42.962
CARLOS, I AM...
SO FLATTERED.

22:42.962 --> 22:45.965
AND I WOULD LOVE TO SAY YES.
IT'S JUST--

22:45.965 --> 22:48.668
I KNOW. MORE RESPONSIBILITY,
MORE HOURS AWAY FROM HOME.

22:48.668 --> 22:51.370
BUT YOU GET A COMPANY CAR
AND AN EXPENSE ACCOUNT.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.804
WHICH IS VERY GENEROUS, BUT I
STILL CAN'T ACCEPT BECAUSE...

22:54.804 --> 22:56.145
AND A 50% SALARY BUMP.

22:56.145 --> 22:59.879
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE
A 50% SALARY BUMP.

22:59.879 --> 23:02.381
BUT NOW THAT IT DOES,
I'M IN.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.853
WHEN DO I START?
 TONIGHT.

23:03.853 --> 23:06.115
WE'RE HAVING DINNER
WITH A BIG POTENTIAL CLIENT.

23:06.115 --> 23:08.818
HE IS BRINGING HIS WIFE,
SO PLEASE BRING TOM.

23:08.818 --> 23:09.919
SURE.

23:12.061 --> 23:14.694
WAIT.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.796
WEREN'T YOU GONNA
GIVE THIS PROMOTION TO JUDY?

23:16.796 --> 23:18.828
(inhales deeply) I WAS.

23:18.828 --> 23:20.970
(exhales deeply)
BUT BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

23:20.970 --> 23:22.972
I FOUND OUT SHE'S PREGNANT.

23:22.972 --> 23:25.074
OVERHEARD HER ON THE PHONE.

23:25.074 --> 23:27.076
I SAW WHAT WAS COMING--

23:27.076 --> 23:29.979
DOCTOR'S VISITS, SICK DAYS,
MATERNITY LEAVE.

23:29.979 --> 23:32.942
YEAH, THAT CAN BE ANNOYING.

23:32.942 --> 23:35.445
BUT ISN'T DENYING A WOMAN
A PROMOTION

23:35.445 --> 23:38.147
BECAUSE SHE'S PREGNANT
A TINY BIT ILLEGAL?

23:38.147 --> 23:40.720
ONLY IF SHE FINDS OUT.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.793
AND, I MEAN, WHO'S GONNA
TELL HER--MY NEW SENIOR V.P.?

23:43.793 --> 23:45.054
HELL, NO.

23:45.054 --> 23:48.798
SHE'S TOO BUSY THINKING ABOUT
THAT BIG BUMP SHE'S GOT COMING.

23:48.798 --> 23:50.700
(chuckles)

23:57.206 --> 23:58.738
(types)

23:58.738 --> 24:00.439
YES?

24:02.672 --> 24:04.674
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT LAST NIGHT,

24:04.674 --> 24:07.777
AND YOU, KARL, CANDY...

24:07.777 --> 24:10.780
AND IT FINALLY HIT ME
WHAT WAS REALLY GOING ON.

24:10.780 --> 24:13.483
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

24:13.483 --> 24:15.755
THE OIL
ON THE DANCE FLOOR--

24:15.755 --> 24:18.457
THAT WAS NO ACCIDENT.
YOU PUT IT THERE.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.790
YOU WANTED CANDY TO FALL.

24:20.790 --> 24:22.662
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

24:22.662 --> 24:23.993
ADMIT IT.

24:23.993 --> 24:25.995
YOU WERE JEALOUS OF THAT GIRL

24:25.995 --> 24:29.699
FROM THE MOMENT
KARL WALKED IN WITH HER.
 ORSON, YOU'RE NOT MAKING
ANY SENSE.

24:29.699 --> 24:32.001
WHY WOULD I BE JEALOUS
OF KARL'S DATE?

24:32.001 --> 24:34.243
BECAUSE SHE WAS
DANCING WITH ME, OF COURSE.

24:37.076 --> 24:39.779
I-I SUPPOSE
I SHOULD BE MAD AT YOU

24:39.779 --> 24:42.481
FOR NEARLY BREAKING MY NECK,
BUT I'M TOO RELIEVED.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.153
RELIEVED?

24:44.153 --> 24:46.656
YES, IF WATCHING ME
DANCE WITH A PRETTY GIRL

24:46.656 --> 24:48.688
CAN MAKE YOU THAT CRAZY,

24:48.688 --> 24:50.690
THEN YOU OBVIOUSLY
STILL CARE FOR ME.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.692
THERE'S STILL HOPE FOR US.

24:52.692 --> 24:55.765
ORSON, YOU ARE READING WAY
TOO MUCH INTO ONE IMPULSIVE ACT.

24:55.765 --> 24:57.827
OHH, ARGUE ALL YOU LIKE.

24:57.827 --> 25:00.530
A WOMAN DOESN'T
PULL A STUNT LIKE THAT

25:00.530 --> 25:04.203
OVER A MAN
SHE'S NOT IN LOVE WITH.

25:06.205 --> 25:07.877
(door closes)

25:19.649 --> 25:21.520
KARL? HI, IT'S BREE.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.253
UM, I AM THINKING...

25:24.253 --> 25:27.927
MAYBE I'M READY
FOR THAT WEEKEND IN LAS VEGAS.

25:29.999 --> 25:32.562
(beep)

25:32.562 --> 25:34.063
(exhales deeply)

25:34.063 --> 25:36.205
(doorbell rings)

25:38.207 --> 25:39.939
HI, MRS. BOLEN.

25:39.939 --> 25:42.171
I'M A FRIEND OF DANNY'S
FROM SCHOOL. IS HE IN?

25:42.171 --> 25:44.914
YOU GOT A NAME?
 SORRY. EDDIE.

25:44.914 --> 25:47.747
DANNY! THERE'S AN EDDIE HERE.

25:54.624 --> 25:57.026
IT'S A NICE HOUSE.

25:57.026 --> 25:59.028
YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED HERE, RIGHT?

25:59.028 --> 26:00.730
HUH? OH, YEAH.

26:00.730 --> 26:02.031
(imitates gunshot)

26:02.031 --> 26:04.093
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

26:04.093 --> 26:06.636
HEY. WHAT'S UP?
 HEY. MY BRAKES ARE SHOT.

26:06.636 --> 26:08.798
IS THERE ANY CHANCE
YOU COULD TAKE A LOOK AT 'EM?

26:08.798 --> 26:12.041
NAH. I-I DON'T
FEEL LIKE IT, EDDIE.

26:12.041 --> 26:14.744
COME ON. YOU'VE BEEN MOPING
AROUND THE HOUSE ALL DAY.

26:14.744 --> 26:16.245
GO. HELP YOUR BUDDY.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.279
(Eddie) OKAY.

26:20.279 --> 26:23.112
(door closes)

26:23.112 --> 26:25.615
(sighs) I'M GLAD ONE OF US
HAS A FRIEND.

26:25.615 --> 26:26.986
(chuckles)

26:26.986 --> 26:28.988
I WAS AT THE SUPERMARKET
EARLIER.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.990
EVERYBODY WAS LOOKING AT ME

26:30.990 --> 26:33.022
LIKE I HAD THEIR GRANDMOTHER
IN MY TRUNK.

26:33.022 --> 26:37.627
YEAH. WHILE YOU WERE OUT,
THREE HATE CALLS IN ONE HOUR.

26:37.627 --> 26:39.629
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M STARTIN' TO THINK

26:39.629 --> 26:41.931
IT'S TIME TO GET OUT
OF THE BOLEN BUSINESS.

26:44.073 --> 26:46.375
(speaks inaudibly)

26:46.375 --> 26:48.607
NO.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.609
WE CANNOT
CHANGE OUR NAMES AND RUN

26:50.609 --> 26:52.611
EVERY TIME
THERE'S A LITTLE TROUBLE.

26:52.611 --> 26:55.384
THIS IS MORE
THAN A LITTLE TROUBLE, BABE.

26:55.384 --> 26:58.848
I DON'T CARE.

26:58.848 --> 27:02.291
WE ARE NOT PUTTING DANNY
THROUGH ALL THAT AGAIN.

27:02.291 --> 27:05.755
AND MAYBE THIS HASN'T WORKED OUT
THEY WAY WE'D HOPE.

27:05.755 --> 27:09.929
BUT UNTIL I SAY OTHERWISE,
WE ARE NICK AND ANGIE BOLEN.

27:56.245 --> 27:59.809
THANKS. ACTUALLY, THAT'S WHAT
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

27:59.809 --> 28:02.982
I DIDN'T HURT HER,
MRS. DELFINO.

28:02.982 --> 28:06.285
BUT YOU DID FIGHT WITH HER.
I MEAN, MRS. McCLUSKEY SAW YOU.

28:08.988 --> 28:12.191
WHAT WERE YOU FIGHTING
WITH HER ABOUT?

28:12.191 --> 28:14.263
I'M SORRY.

 UM, I DIDN'T KNOW.

28:36.245 --> 28:39.749
IS THAT WHY

 NO, I-I DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW THAT.

28:39.749 --> 28:42.822

(mirror shatters and clanks)
 MA! CAREFUL!

29:23.362 --> 29:26.035
YOU COME NEAR HIM AGAIN,
I SWEAR I WILL KILL YOU.

29:26.035 --> 29:28.037
YOU CAN'T PROTECT HIM
FOREVER.

29:28.037 --> 29:32.001
PEOPLE KNOW WHAT HE IS NOW,
AND HE'S GONNA BE PUNISHED.

30:02.501 --> 30:05.804

I PUT HIM AT OUR BEST TABLE.
 THANK YOU, SWEETIE.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.536
LYNETTE?
 YEAH?

30:07.536 --> 30:10.039
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

30:10.039 --> 30:13.082
ABOUT BEING SENIOR V.P.
WITH A 50% SALARY BUMP?

30:13.082 --> 30:16.215
UH, YEAH.
 BUT DID YOU HEAR THE WAY
HE DESCRIBED THE JOB IN THE CAR?

30:16.215 --> 30:18.918
I MEAN, IT SOUNDS LIKE
A KILLER SCHEDULE.

30:18.918 --> 30:22.121
I CAN HANDLE IT.
AND YOU GET TO STAY IN SCHOOL.

30:22.121 --> 30:24.123
REMEMBER YOUR BIG DREAM?
OUR FUTURE?

30:24.123 --> 30:26.856
OF COURSE. BUT HOW ARE WE
GONNA KEEP IT A SECRET?

30:26.856 --> 30:29.158
CARLOS IS GONNA FIND OUT
ABOUT THIS THING EVENTUALLY.

30:29.158 --> 30:33.002
BY THEN, I WILL HAVE PROVED
I CAN DO THE JOB,

30:33.002 --> 30:35.104
PREGNANT OR NOT.

30:35.104 --> 30:37.006
PLEASE?

30:37.006 --> 30:38.467
OKAY. I'M IN.

30:38.467 --> 30:40.870
BUT YOU GOTTA PROVE IT FAST.

30:40.870 --> 30:42.972
REMEMBER LAST TIME YOU WERE
PREGNANT WITH TWINS?

30:42.972 --> 30:44.974
EVERY PART OF YOU
SWELLED UP.

30:44.974 --> 30:46.976
IT WAS LIKE
SLEEPING NEXT TO A BODY

30:46.976 --> 30:49.178
THEY DRAGGED OUT
OF THE RIVER.

30:49.178 --> 30:51.150
YOU SAID I WAS BEAUTIFUL.

30:51.150 --> 30:54.253
I HAD TO.
YOU WERE TWICE MY SIZE.

30:54.253 --> 30:56.585
THIS IS A 2004 BAROLO

30:56.585 --> 30:58.587
FROM MY VINEYARD
IN PIEDMONT.

30:58.587 --> 31:00.189
YOUR VINEYARD?

31:00.189 --> 31:02.892
YEAH. THAT'S WHY I INSISTED
ON THIS RESTAURANT.

31:02.892 --> 31:05.034
THEY, UH, CARRY MY LABEL.
(chuckles)

31:05.034 --> 31:08.367
I LOVE BUSINESS,
BUT WINE IS MY PASSION.

31:08.367 --> 31:11.240
OH, NONE FOR ME TONIGHT.

31:11.240 --> 31:13.402
WHY NOT?

31:13.402 --> 31:16.976
WELL... I WANNA KEEP
MY HEAD CLEAR FOR BUSINESS.

31:16.976 --> 31:18.647
NO. NO BUSINESS TALK.

31:18.647 --> 31:20.649
TONIGHT IS ABOUT
GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER

31:20.649 --> 31:23.212
OVER GOOD FOOD
AND FINE WINE.

31:23.212 --> 31:25.284
YEAH, LYNETTE, HIS WINE.

31:25.284 --> 31:27.886
SO DRINK UP.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.559
WELL, I GUESS A LITTLE
WOULDN'T HURT.

31:30.559 --> 31:31.921
THERE.

31:33.963 --> 31:35.594
YEAH. VERY NICE.

31:37.666 --> 31:39.969
SO... (clears throat)

31:39.969 --> 31:41.600
VIC...

31:41.600 --> 31:44.173
WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST
TO GO WITH YOUR WINE?

31:44.173 --> 31:46.335
LET ME SEE.

31:49.578 --> 31:51.240
OH...

31:51.240 --> 31:53.983
THE CARPACCIO SOUNDS
LIKE A NICE STARTER.

31:53.983 --> 31:56.245
WOW.

31:56.245 --> 31:59.148
LYNETTE. YOU LIKED IT, HUH?

31:59.148 --> 32:01.190
IT WAS DELICIOUS.

32:01.190 --> 32:03.322
LUCKY FOR YOU,
IT'S A BIG VINEYARD.

32:03.322 --> 32:05.694
OH.
 (laughs)

32:05.694 --> 32:07.926
(Lynette) THANK YOU.
 (chuckles)

32:09.598 --> 32:13.402
OH, LOOK!
ONE OF THE POINTER SISTERS!

32:18.637 --> 32:20.569
SORRY.

32:20.569 --> 32:22.711
IT WAS, UM, JUST A NUN.

32:29.318 --> 32:30.619
(sighs)

32:30.619 --> 32:32.951
EXCUSE ME. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

32:34.984 --> 32:37.486
(sighs) GABY, WHAT THE HELL?

32:37.486 --> 32:40.629
I KNOW. I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

32:40.629 --> 32:42.561
I MEAN YOUR CLOTHES.

32:42.561 --> 32:45.564
DIDN'T I SEE THAT SHIRT
IN THE HAMPER THIS MORNING?

32:45.564 --> 32:48.337
I GAVE IT A SNIFF.
IT HAS ANOTHER DAY IN IT.

32:48.337 --> 32:50.569
GABY, THIS IS
AN IMPORTANT BUSINESS DINNER.

32:50.569 --> 32:52.571
YEAH, BUT IT'S ALSO
JOHN ROWLAND'S RESTAURANT.

32:52.571 --> 32:54.573
IF I MADE MYSELF PRETTY,

32:54.573 --> 32:57.306
YOU MIGHT THINK I WAS
DOING IT JUST FOR HIM.

32:57.306 --> 33:00.609
OH, GOD HELP ME.
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?
 WELL, I DIDN'T WANT
TO RUN THE RISK

33:00.609 --> 33:03.612
OF FAILING ANOTHER TEST.
 OKAY, GABY, GO CHANGE.
YOU MADE YOUR POINT.

33:03.612 --> 33:05.684
NOT QUITE.

33:05.684 --> 33:08.687
FOR THE PAST 11 YEARS,
I HAVE STOOD BESIDE YOU

33:08.687 --> 33:11.690
WHEN YOU WERE POOR AND BLIND
AND KNOCKED ME UP TWICE.

33:11.690 --> 33:13.622
AT THIS POINT
IN OUR MARRIAGE,

33:13.622 --> 33:15.624
IF YOU STILL FEEL THE NEED
TO TEST ME,

33:15.624 --> 33:17.726
THEN YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S FAILED.

33:20.199 --> 33:21.500
YOU'RE RIGHT.

33:23.272 --> 33:25.234
I'M SORRY.

33:25.234 --> 33:27.576
THANK YOU.
AND FOR THE RECORD,

33:27.576 --> 33:30.579
I ONLY TOOK MY CLIP OFF
AND SHOOK OUT MY HAIR

33:30.579 --> 33:32.641
BECAUSE I RAN INTO SOMEBODY
I KNEW.

33:32.641 --> 33:35.584
I WOULD'VE DONE IT
IF IT WAS LYNETTE SCAVO, OKAY?

33:35.584 --> 33:37.486
OKAY.

33:37.486 --> 33:39.448
SO DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN GO HOME AND...

33:39.448 --> 33:42.491
OH, DON'T WORRY. I HAVE CLOTHES
AND MAKEUP IN THE CAR.

33:42.491 --> 33:46.525
GOOD, BECAUSE THAT SHIRT
DID NOT HAVE ANOTHER DAY IN IT.

33:49.498 --> 33:52.431
(telephone rings)

33:52.431 --> 33:54.103
(beep)

33:54.103 --> 33:56.805
HELLO?

33:56.805 --> 33:58.567
WHO IS THIS?

33:58.567 --> 34:01.210
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

34:01.210 --> 34:03.642
OH, YOU GOT A BIG MOUTH
FOR A GUY WITH NO NAME.

34:03.642 --> 34:06.715
NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, YOU LISTEN TO ME.

34:06.715 --> 34:08.717
YOU COME ANYWHERE
NEAR MY FAMILY,

34:08.717 --> 34:11.380
I WILL PERSONALLY
BASH YOUR BRAINS IN--

34:11.380 --> 34:15.324
ASSUMING YOU HAVE ANY!
 (beep)

34:15.324 --> 34:16.725
YOU OKAY?

34:16.725 --> 34:21.260
I'M FINE. JUST ANOTHER MORON
WITH SOME EMPTY THREATS.

34:23.161 --> 34:25.534
AND WHAT IF
THEY'RE NOT EMPTY?

34:31.500 --> 34:34.503
DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR FATHER
AND I KEEP THE GUN?

34:34.503 --> 34:36.445
MA...

34:36.445 --> 34:38.746
NO, LOOK, YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH
TO KNOW THIS STUFF.

34:38.746 --> 34:42.781
JUST IN CASE SOMEONE SHOULD TRY
TO COME IN HERE AND HURT YOU...
 I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

34:42.781 --> 34:47.386
WELL, JUST IN CASE YOU CAN'T
 TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF...

34:49.318 --> 34:53.262
THERE IS A LOADED
.38 SMITH & WESSON IN A BOX

34:53.262 --> 34:55.563
IN THE SECOND DRAWER
IN MY DRESSER.

34:55.563 --> 34:57.396
YOU GOT THAT?

35:00.699 --> 35:03.872
WHAT ARE YOU SMILING AT?

35:03.872 --> 35:06.475
IT'S JUST...

35:06.475 --> 35:09.838
IT'S NOT YOUR TYPICAL
MOTHER/SON CONVERSATION.

35:09.838 --> 35:12.541
YOU KNOW
I'VE ALWAYS FELT BAD

35:12.541 --> 35:15.244
ABOUT THE WAY
WE'VE HAD TO RAISE YOU,

35:15.244 --> 35:17.246
BEING ON THE RUN AND ALL.

35:17.246 --> 35:19.188
(sighs)
IF IT WEREN'T FOR ME,

35:19.188 --> 35:21.390
YOU COULDA HAD
A NORMAL CHILDHOOD.

35:21.390 --> 35:25.594
MA, YOU DON'T EVER HAVE
TO APOLOGIZE TO ME.

35:27.426 --> 35:30.559
I'M GLAD YOU'RE NOT LIKE
OTHER MOMS.

35:30.559 --> 35:33.432
THANKS, BABY.

35:33.432 --> 35:36.305
I JUST WANNA BE A GOOD ONE.

35:40.569 --> 35:42.271
REMEMBER...

35:42.271 --> 35:45.814
AIM FOR THE HEAD,
NOT THE LEGS.

35:48.417 --> 35:49.918
SO PATTI COMES DOWNSTAIRS,

35:49.918 --> 35:51.920
AND SITTING
UNDER THE CHRISTMAS TREE

35:51.920 --> 35:56.485
IS THE CUTEST GOLDEN RETRIEVER
PUPPY YOU EVER SAW.

35:56.485 --> 35:59.528
OH, IT WAS
THE BEST PRESENT I EVER GOT.
 AW.

35:59.528 --> 36:01.790
DO YOU LIKE DOGS, LYNETTE?

36:01.790 --> 36:03.562
OOH, I LOVE 'EM!

36:03.562 --> 36:05.564
(slurring)
BUT PENNY IS ALLERGIC,

36:05.564 --> 36:07.696
SO WE GOT FISH.
(chuckles)

36:07.696 --> 36:10.168
FISH SUCK.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.170
SWIM, DIE, FLUSH--NEW ONE.
(chuckles)

36:12.170 --> 36:14.203
SWIM, DIE, FLUSH--NEW ONE.

36:14.203 --> 36:17.246
YOU KNOW, WHAT DOG I'D REALLY
LIKE IS THE REIMA-WANER.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.210
WEIMARANER.

36:21.210 --> 36:22.381
A WINDOW-HAMMER.

36:22.381 --> 36:23.912
WEIMARANER.

36:23.912 --> 36:25.214
RAMMERJAMMER.

36:25.214 --> 36:26.485
LYNETTE, MAKE HIM STOP.

36:26.485 --> 36:29.858
GABY, YOU KNOW, I...
I WANNA TELL YOU SOMETHING,

36:29.858 --> 36:33.322
BUT I'M AFRAID
IT'S GONNA COME OUT WRONG.

36:33.322 --> 36:36.695
YOUR BOOBS LOOK GREAT
 IN THAT DRESS.

36:36.695 --> 36:41.500
WELL, TOM, HOW COULD THAT
POSSIBLY COME OUT WRONG?

36:41.500 --> 36:43.802
(chuckles)
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

36:43.802 --> 36:48.577
WELL, YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE TOM.
HE'S A BIT OF A LIGHTWEIGHT.

36:48.577 --> 36:51.810
AND YOUR WINE IS SO DELICIOUS,
HE COULDN'T RESIST.

36:51.810 --> 36:54.783
BUT LOOK AT YOU.
YOU HAD AT LEAST A BOTTLE,

36:54.783 --> 36:58.447
AND YOU'D NEVER KNOW.
MIGHT AS WELL FINISH THIS OFF.
 NO, NO, NO!

36:58.447 --> 37:01.950
IF SHE HAS ONE MORE GLASS,
I'M GONNA PUKE.

37:19.938 --> 37:21.810
(door opens)

37:29.978 --> 37:31.920
I JUST TALKED TO BOB.

37:31.920 --> 37:33.922
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

37:33.922 --> 37:36.655
HE ASKED ME TO STOP BY...

37:36.655 --> 37:38.957
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO TELL ME
THAT THE POLICE

37:38.957 --> 37:43.732
HAVE EVIDENCE THAT CLEARS
DANNY BOLEN.

37:43.732 --> 37:46.465
WHAT?

37:46.465 --> 37:47.966
THEY'VE GOT A SHOT

37:47.966 --> 37:49.968
FROM A SECURITY CAMERA
AT FAIRVIEW LIQUORS

37:49.968 --> 37:52.541
THAT PUTS HIM THERE
AT THE TIME JULIE WAS ATTACKED.
 HOW WOULD THEY KNOW THAT?

37:52.541 --> 37:56.375
THERE WAS A TIME STAMP.
 THEY DON'T KNOW
THE EXACT TIME OF THE ATTACK.

37:56.375 --> 37:59.678
THE CAMERA SHOWS HIM SITTING
IN THE PARKING LOT DRINKING BEER

37:59.678 --> 38:01.049
FOR OVER AN HOUR.

38:02.811 --> 38:04.783
HE COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT.

38:07.616 --> 38:09.958
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

38:13.822 --> 38:17.926
THAT MEANS THAT JULIE'S ATTACKER
IS STILL OUT THERE.

38:17.926 --> 38:20.429
AND I'VE BEEN GOING
UP AND DOWN THE STREET

38:20.429 --> 38:22.931
TELLING EVERYBODY
THAT DANNY BOLEN DID IT.

38:22.931 --> 38:26.705
YOUR DAUGHTER WAS HURT.
YOU WANTED SOMEBODY TO BLAME.

38:26.705 --> 38:28.407
PEOPLE GET THAT.

38:28.407 --> 38:31.780
OH, GOD. I'M...
I'M SO SORRY.

38:31.780 --> 38:34.643
WELL, I'M SURE
THE BOLENS WILL UNDERSTAND.

38:34.643 --> 38:37.416
NO, NOT JUST TO THEM.

38:37.416 --> 38:38.747
TO YOU.

38:38.747 --> 38:41.750
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

38:41.750 --> 38:45.724
WELL, YOU WOKE UP
THE MORNING AFTER YOUR WEDDING

38:45.724 --> 38:49.528
AND FOUND YOURSELF
MARRIED TO A MADWOMAN.

38:49.528 --> 38:52.561
I HAVE BEEN...

38:52.561 --> 38:56.535
JUST TOTALLY OBSESSED WITH
FINDING JULIE'S ATTACKER, AND...

38:56.535 --> 38:59.868
I SAID,
"FOR BETTER OR WORSE."

39:02.110 --> 39:06.715
SO WE START WITH THE WORSE.

39:15.924 --> 39:19.658
WOW, GLAD THIS NIGHT'S OVER.
I'M EXHAUSTED.

39:19.658 --> 39:22.461
YEAH, ME, TOO.

39:22.461 --> 39:23.762
YOU COMING TO BED?

39:23.762 --> 39:26.795
I'LL BE UP IN A SEC.
I'M GONNA TURN OFF SOME LIGHTS.

39:29.768 --> 39:31.770
(sighs)

40:19.988 --> 40:24.893
ON THIS STREET, THE DAY BEGINS
WITH A CUP OF COFFEE.

40:27.996 --> 40:32.601
SOME DRINK IT WHILE RECALLING
A LOVER THEY ONCE CARED FOR.

40:34.102 --> 40:39.568
SOME POUR IT, THINKING OF
THE BOSS THEY MUST LIE TO.

40:39.568 --> 40:42.541
OTHERS SIP IT,

40:42.541 --> 40:46.444
CONTEMPLATING A MAN
THEY MIGHT BE IN LOVE WITH.

40:48.577 --> 40:52.481
BUT FOR ONE WOMAN,
ON THIS PARTICULAR MORNING,

40:52.481 --> 40:56.024
THAT CUP OF COFFEE
HAS TO WAIT...

40:57.826 --> 41:02.460
BECAUSE SHE DISCOVERS
A NEIGHBOR IN TROUBLE.

41:03.592 --> 41:05.093
SHE GOES TO HELP,

41:05.093 --> 41:09.968
NOT ONLY BECAUSE
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO,

41:09.968 --> 41:14.102
BUT BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY WAY
SHE CAN THINK OF...

41:14.102 --> 41:17.075
TO ASK FOR FORGIVENESS.

41:18.547 --> 41:21.810
AND ONCE IT IS GIVEN...

41:21.810 --> 41:24.613
THE DAY BEGINS.
