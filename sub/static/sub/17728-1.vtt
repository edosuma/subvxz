01:24.992 --> 01:28.362
- Nothin', nothin' at all.
- Send it again.

01:28.862 --> 01:30.864
I've been sendin' it up and down the
coast from Sarasota to the everglades.

01:31.365 --> 01:32.866
It's still getting back
the same day it aired.

01:33.367 --> 01:37.871
There's nothing. There's nobody,
or at least nobody with a radio.

01:37.906 --> 01:40.516
All right then. Let's set
down. We'll use the bullhorn.

01:40.551 --> 01:43.091
Set down? Wait a minute.
That's not in our contract.

01:43.126 --> 01:46.630
It's the biggest city within 150
miles. We're gonna give it every chance.

01:46.665 --> 01:50.133
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Set down, John.

01:50.634 --> 01:54.638
I'll set us down, but I won't leave my
seat, and I値l keep the engine running.

01:55.138 --> 01:58.607
Now, the first sign
of trouble, I知 going up.

01:58.642 --> 02:03.647
If you ain't on board when that happens,
you're likely to have a lousy afternoon.

03:07.844 --> 03:10.597
Calling anybody
on this frequency.

03:10.632 --> 03:13.565
This is
helicopter 4-0-alpha.

03:13.600 --> 03:16.603
If you can hear me,
please listen carefully.

03:41.995 --> 03:43.997
Hello?

03:45.999 --> 03:52.005
Hello?
Is anyone there?

03:52.255 --> 03:54.257
Hello?

03:57.260 --> 03:59.262
Hello?

04:00.397 --> 04:02.899
Is anyone there?

04:05.902 --> 04:10.907
Hello?
Is anyone there?

04:13.910 --> 04:17.414
Is anyone there?

04:22.419 --> 04:24.921
Hello?

04:26.923 --> 04:30.176
Is there anyone there?

04:42.055 --> 04:44.558
Hello?

04:52.899 --> 04:55.285
Hello?

04:56.786 --> 04:59.789
Is there anyone there?

05:00.290 --> 05:06.162
Hello?

05:08.164 --> 05:10.667
Is anyone there?

05:17.173 --> 05:20.176
Hello?

05:37.827 --> 05:43.333
We can lift you out to safety. Please
answer my call if you can hear me.

05:43.368 --> 05:48.338
Forget it, Billy boy.
It's a dead place.

05:48.373 --> 05:51.841
They got the others,
you know.

05:51.876 --> 05:55.345
Listen.

05:56.346 --> 05:58.848
You can hear it
over the engine.

05:59.849 --> 06:03.353
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

07:09.285 --> 07:12.253
Hey, you find anything?

07:12.288 --> 07:17.177
Yeah. A bunch of real estate
for sale at closeout prices, man.

07:17.212 --> 07:19.644
Gas up the machine.
She's down to fumes.

07:19.679 --> 07:23.299
No. Wait till it's dark. There
are too many of them out there.

07:23.800 --> 07:26.401
Yeah-hey, it's no good to
leave the gas tank empty.

07:26.436 --> 07:30.440
- Suppose we need to get out of here in a hurry.
- Then we're shit out of luck.

07:30.475 --> 07:34.444
They're getting too riled up. Do
it tonight when they can't see you.

07:34.694 --> 07:39.315
They know we're in here even if they can't see
us. What good is it to leave the gas tank emp...

07:39.449 --> 07:43.202
the activity excites them. There are too
many of them. And more and more every day.

07:43.237 --> 07:46.956
If we get a lot more, come out and shoot
some. Otherwise, stay inside the building.

07:46.991 --> 07:49.959
Stay out of sight. Be thankful
you live in the suburbs, Johnson.

07:49.994 --> 07:53.463
You oughta see how congested
the city's gettin' to be.

07:59.219 --> 08:02.687
Miguel, come on.
Let's get below.

08:02.722 --> 08:07.692
Miguel, what can I
do? You... you... what?

08:07.727 --> 08:11.231
Let me help. No. I... I don't
need help. I don't need help.

08:11.266 --> 08:13.698
Come on. Give me this. I'm
all right. I'm just tired.

08:13.733 --> 08:17.237
You're not. You're collapsing from stress.
Now, let me help... collapsing from stress?

08:17.737 --> 08:20.240
We're all collapsing. This whole
fucking unit is collapsing...

08:20.275 --> 08:22.242
everybody except you.

08:22.742 --> 08:24.744
I know you're strong,
all right? So what?

08:25.245 --> 08:28.248
Stronger than me. Stronger
than everyone. So what?

08:28.283 --> 08:31.251
So fucking what?

08:49.385 --> 08:54.390
- That's a new grave.
- Major cooper. He died this morning.

08:55.892 --> 08:58.359
And then there were 12.

08:58.394 --> 09:00.995
A burial this morning. That's
why there are so many of them.

09:01.030 --> 09:04.534
What's gonna bring them tomorrow, Sarah?
And the next day and the next day after?

09:04.569 --> 09:10.505
There are hundreds of 'em over
there, thousands. A million of them!

09:10.540 --> 09:15.294
You stick your head in the sun, they're gonna
come up behind you and bite off your ass!

09:15.329 --> 09:20.049
This is bullshit. Crazy. If you've got an
alternative, we'd be happy to listen to it.

09:20.550 --> 09:23.017
I got an alternative. Yeah,
yeah. I got an alternative.

09:23.052 --> 09:27.056
Let's get in that whirlybird, find us
an island someplace, get juiced up...

09:27.557 --> 09:31.060
and spend what time we got left
soakin' up some sunshine.

09:31.095 --> 09:33.528
How's that? You could
do that, couldn't you?

09:33.563 --> 09:36.065
With all that's going on, you could
do that without a second thought?

09:36.566 --> 09:41.070
Right. I could do that even
if all this wasn't goin' on.

10:12.218 --> 10:15.722
Another waste of time,
right? Got that right, man.

10:27.617 --> 10:30.585
What'd you find?
Nothin'.

10:30.620 --> 10:34.490
Nothin'? How far
up the coast did you go?

10:34.991 --> 10:37.592
A hundred miles each way.

10:37.627 --> 10:41.130
Jump in here, soldier. We gotta bring
in two more dumb fucks. Let's go.

10:41.631 --> 10:44.634
- Two more? What's Logan doing to them in there?
- Get in here.

10:44.669 --> 10:47.136
He's been awake for 24 hours.
Can't you get anyone else?

10:47.637 --> 10:50.605
What "anyone else"? There
isn't anyone else. We're it.

10:50.640 --> 10:54.143
The two of you can't go in
there alone. It's too dangerous.

10:56.145 --> 10:59.614
Christ. I'll go!

10:59.649 --> 11:03.152
- What's the matter with your friend there?
- There's nothing the matter.

11:03.187 --> 11:06.022
All right. Let's go.

11:11.027 --> 11:13.529
You got it, Steel.

11:42.558 --> 11:46.562
Let's kick it out.
Come on. Step forward.

12:15.475 --> 12:18.559
This shows the 15th as the
last time you took any out.

12:18.594 --> 12:22.598
That can't be right. Oh, yeah. We
forget to write 'em up sometimes.

12:22.633 --> 12:25.368
You've got to write them up.
It's essential.

12:25.403 --> 12:28.069
Can't you get that
through your thick skull?

12:28.104 --> 12:32.108
How the hell are we supposed to
keep track of how many we got left?

12:38.748 --> 12:41.751
Let's go, you dumb fucks!
Get over here!

12:42.001 --> 12:45.470
Hey! Here we are!

12:45.505 --> 12:48.574
Come on!

12:52.211 --> 12:54.712
Come on, you dumb fucks.
Come on. Come on.

12:54.747 --> 13:00.219
- Come on, you fish brains. What
the hell's the matter with ya?

13:00.254 --> 13:03.106
They're scared.

13:03.606 --> 13:07.335
They know what'll happen
when Frankenstein gets 'em.

13:07.370 --> 13:11.064
If you're right, Rickles,
then they're learning.

13:11.099 --> 13:14.532
They're actually learning. Come on!

13:14.567 --> 13:19.455
Come and see what I got for
you! Come on, you dick faces!

13:19.490 --> 13:23.374
Here's a nice one hangin'.
Come on. Come and get it.

13:23.409 --> 13:28.164
- Come and try to bite it off!
- That's it. Whip it out. That'll bring 'em on.

13:28.664 --> 13:32.633
Fuckin' "a. " Biggest
piece of meat in the cave.

13:32.668 --> 13:37.138
I don't wanna excite the lady
though. Not with her boyfriend around.

13:37.173 --> 13:41.811
You're incapable of exciting me, Steel,
except as an anthropological curiosity.

13:41.928 --> 13:46.030
- What the hell's that mean, Rickles?
- It means you're a caveman.

13:46.065 --> 13:51.571
You're a fuckin' throwback. You've been
spendin' too much time underground, huh?

13:51.606 --> 13:57.076
It's okay, Steel.
Throwbacks all got big dicks.

13:57.111 --> 14:00.545
Oh!

14:00.580 --> 14:04.083
All right, you dumb fucks!
Get over here, you scumbags!

14:04.118 --> 14:08.204
Your old pal Steel
wants to see ya.

14:10.206 --> 14:12.173
- Shit.
- I'm coming up.

14:12.208 --> 14:15.711
You're not strong enough for up here. Send
up the pole. I'll watch out for lover boy.

14:15.746 --> 14:18.679
Don't worry. I'm not strong enough?
I've done it dozens of times.

14:18.714 --> 14:22.718
I don't want you up here, lady. Send
up the pole. They're gettin' closer.

14:22.753 --> 14:25.221
He's clamping. Look at
'im. Let go of the pole.

14:25.721 --> 14:29.190
Listen to me.
Let go of the goddamn pole.

14:29.225 --> 14:31.727
Here they come! Let's go!

14:31.978 --> 14:36.948
Dumb fucks.
Pus-breeding bags of shit.

14:36.983 --> 14:41.487
You dumb-fucking bags of shit, I値l
kick your fuckin' asses. Come on!

14:47.376 --> 14:50.880
Come here, scumbag.

15:03.759 --> 15:07.763
Hook her up, will ya? Hook her.

15:10.266 --> 15:13.152
Hey, nice hat,
asshole.

15:16.656 --> 15:18.658
Come on! Get the other one out of there!

15:46.969 --> 15:50.473
Steel, Steel, Steel,
cover! Cover!

15:50.508 --> 15:53.941
I got it.
- Geez.

15:53.976 --> 15:57.980
That's it. That's it. That's
it. I got it. I got it. Come on.

15:58.015 --> 16:01.984
Come on. Come here.
Come here.

16:09.625 --> 16:15.131
You almost killed Rickles.
Yeah. You almost killed Rickles.

16:15.166 --> 16:18.599
Let 'im go, Steel.

16:18.634 --> 16:21.504
- He shouldn't have been
up there in the first place.

16:22.004 --> 16:25.473
Steel, stop it!

16:25.508 --> 16:30.012
You dirty son of a bitch!
Let him go! Let him go,

16:30.047 --> 16:33.015
goddamn it,
or I値l cut you in half.

17:01.377 --> 17:04.380
Shut up, you dumb fucks. I hope
they chop you up for dog meat.

17:04.880 --> 17:07.383
Come on, Rickles.
Let's get out of here.

17:07.417 --> 17:11.887
I hope you fuckin' rot!
Fuck you!

17:24.282 --> 17:27.787
I am not gonna let you
dope me up.

17:30.790 --> 17:34.759
You need a sedative.
You're behaving dangerously.

17:34.794 --> 17:39.799
- I'm just trying to help you, Miguel.
- Well, I don't need your help.

17:46.806 --> 17:49.809
You made me look like
an asshole out there.

17:50.309 --> 17:53.312
You made me feel
like a piece of shit.

17:56.816 --> 17:59.819
You stay away from me
with that, Sarah.

18:00.319 --> 18:04.824
You stay away from me.

18:15.334 --> 18:18.838
Ohh.

18:32.351 --> 18:35.354
You bitch.

18:57.877 --> 19:00.379
We've got to have sterile
conditions. Half the work we do...

19:00.880 --> 19:02.847
goes down the toilet
due to contamination.

19:02.882 --> 19:06.886
You'll work with what you
got, Fisher. But it's madness!

19:07.386 --> 19:13.342
- Can't you understand...
- I understand this: You and your playmates,

19:13.377 --> 19:15.845
you're running out of friends
fast around here.

19:21.434 --> 19:26.439
Look, major cooper
promised that...

19:26.474 --> 19:28.941
major cooper is dead.

19:30.443 --> 19:33.946
I'm in command now,
and I知 telling you...

19:33.981 --> 19:36.914
that you work
with what you got.

19:36.949 --> 19:39.452
And you'd better
start showing me some results...

19:39.952 --> 19:41.454
or you won't have that
very much longer.

19:41.954 --> 19:44.957
How can we show you results when we
don't have the proper working conditions?

19:45.458 --> 19:48.926
We're in a desperate situation
here. We need each other.

19:48.961 --> 19:51.964
Can't we just get along? You
need us, the way I see it, lady.

19:51.999 --> 19:56.469
I'm not sure we need you at all.
Fuckin' "a. "

19:56.936 --> 20:01.440
I'm not even sure what the hell
it is you're doin' in there,

20:01.475 --> 20:04.909
just what the hell my men
are riskin' their asses for.

20:04.944 --> 20:10.449
If there was more cooperation, your men
wouldn't have to risk their asses as often.

20:14.820 --> 20:18.172
- Miguel Salazar痴 in bad shape.
- No shit.

20:18.207 --> 20:24.079
I want him pulled off active duty for a
while until we can evaluate his condition.

20:24.114 --> 20:27.967
- Can't spare 'im. - He's over
the edge. He's turning into jell-o.

20:28.002 --> 20:33.938
- Jell-o? - That's the way the
spicks say "yellow": Jell-o!

20:33.973 --> 20:37.977
Miguel is seriously disturbed.
He's close to the breaking point,

20:38.012 --> 20:40.444
and that's dangerous
for all of us.

20:40.479 --> 20:43.983
He can't handle
any more stress right now.

20:44.483 --> 20:48.988
Well, maybe I should cut off
his extracurricular activities.

20:50.489 --> 20:53.457
Maybe you're
keepin' him too busy at night.

20:53.492 --> 20:57.997
We're talking about a man's
life here, you son of a bitch,

20:58.032 --> 21:01.715
and the lives of others
he might put in jeopardy.

21:01.750 --> 21:05.754
Maybe I should put him in
quarantine. How 'bout it, Steel?

21:05.789 --> 21:09.650
You call it, Captain.
I'll build him a cage.

21:09.685 --> 21:13.477
Yeah. Might not
be a bad idea...

21:13.512 --> 21:16.015
give some of the rest
of us a shot at some lovin'.

21:16.050 --> 21:20.519
Hey, it's gonna
be a long winter.

21:23.522 --> 21:26.607
Come on, Ted.
Let's get out of here.

21:26.642 --> 21:29.645
I'm callin' a meeting
for 7:00 tonight.

21:30.145 --> 21:33.614
I want everybody present.
Everybody, lady,

21:33.649 --> 21:37.117
including dr. Frankenstein
and including your boyfriend.

21:37.152 --> 21:40.539
- I gave him a sedative. He won't be awake.
- Look here, woman.

21:40.574 --> 21:43.542
I'm short on man power.
I won't have you goin' around...

21:43.577 --> 21:46.045
dopin' up any of my men
without orders from me.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.163
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir!

21:48.198 --> 21:50.666
Fuck you, sir!

21:54.403 --> 21:57.471
Out of the frying pan,
into the fire.

21:57.506 --> 22:01.475
I thought cooper was an asshole, but
he was a sweetheart next to Rhodes.

22:01.510 --> 22:06.015
We could be in real trouble. You'd better watch
yourself... I mean, physically watch yourself.

22:06.050 --> 22:09.518
I can handle it. Don't worry.
It's not going to come to that.

22:10.019 --> 22:13.022
We've just gotta pound some logic
into their heads. Impossible.

22:13.057 --> 22:15.524
Where's dr. Logan?

22:16.025 --> 22:18.527
Frankenstein? He's in his
laboratory. Where else?

22:21.363 --> 22:26.001
There's a loss of initiative, caution,
many of the human cognitive functions.

22:26.036 --> 22:30.005
Apparently the result of
decay in the frontal, parietal,

22:30.040 --> 22:32.723
temporal
and occipital lobes.

22:32.758 --> 22:37.513
On revival, the rate of
decomposition slows substantially.

22:37.548 --> 22:40.382
Indications are
that these beings...

22:40.883 --> 22:43.350
could function
over a period of years...

22:43.385 --> 22:48.641
in cases of early revival, 10 to 12 years
before decay would threaten mobility.

22:57.900 --> 23:01.787
The brain is the engine, Sarah,
the motor that drives them.

23:01.904 --> 23:04.406
They don't need any blood flow, don't
need any of their internal organs.

23:04.540 --> 23:08.509
Now, I致e severed all
the vital organs in this one.

23:08.544 --> 23:12.047
There's nothing left of the corpse but
brain and limbs, and still it functions.

23:12.548 --> 23:16.517
Oh, look, Sarah. Look.

23:16.552 --> 23:20.923
See, it wants me. It wants
food, but it has no stomach.

23:20.958 --> 23:23.891
It can take no nourishment
from what it ingests.

23:23.926 --> 23:28.372
It's working on instinct, a
deep, dark, primordial instinct.

23:28.407 --> 23:32.818
Decomposition occurs first in
the frontal lobes, the neocortex,

23:32.853 --> 23:35.821
and next in the limbic
system, the middle brain.

23:36.322 --> 23:41.076
But the core... the core is the last
thing to be attacked by the decay.

23:41.577 --> 23:45.581
It's the "r" complex, Sarah... that
central bit of prehistoric jelly...

23:46.081 --> 23:48.584
that we inherited
from the reptiles.

23:49.084 --> 23:53.205
Here. I've gone into the center here
and attacked the "r" complex discretely.

23:53.240 --> 23:55.806
I've removed it from the
equation... this corpse.

23:55.841 --> 24:00.346
I believe this creature would be benign even
if it had its eyesight and its other senses.

24:00.381 --> 24:03.349
Its primitive instincts
have been erased.

24:12.858 --> 24:17.980
It still has motor function, probably
still has powers of deliberation.

24:19.365 --> 24:22.333
It can be domesticated,
Sarah, don't you see?

24:22.368 --> 24:26.372
It can be conditioned to behave
the way we want it to behave.

24:26.407 --> 24:30.242
And all that's required
is 15 hours of fancy surgery...

24:30.743 --> 24:33.210
that only a handful of people
are trained to do.

24:33.245 --> 24:37.249
We were going to stop work on the neurophysical,
concentrate on something more practical.

24:37.750 --> 24:40.886
These finds are central to the
condition. I will not stop work...

24:41.387 --> 24:45.699
that might lead to an answer, let alone in
an area that is central to the condition.

24:45.734 --> 24:50.012
But you're just proving theories
that were advanced months ago.

24:50.512 --> 24:54.016
And you're not even proving them correctly.
You're making a lot of assumptions.

24:54.051 --> 24:58.520
You're wasting time trying
to define what's happening...

24:58.555 --> 25:01.488
instead of looking
for what's making it happen.

25:01.523 --> 25:05.027
And just slicing up too many
specimens. It's extremely dangerous...

25:05.062 --> 25:06.994
to go up on top
and round them up in the wild.

25:07.029 --> 25:10.998
Well, we can't control them.
What happened to this one?

25:11.033 --> 25:14.536
It was too unruly. I couldn't
handle it. I had to destroy it.

25:15.037 --> 25:19.041
- We can still get information from it.
- Dr. Logan,

25:19.076 --> 25:21.543
we are losing
the cooperation of the men.

25:22.044 --> 25:25.547
I'm not even sure they'll go up top
when we run out of the specimens we have.

25:25.582 --> 25:29.301
I'm not sure they won't just
try to shut us down completely.

25:29.336 --> 25:33.771
Well, I値l show them results.
I'll show them results.

25:33.806 --> 25:38.811
I'll show them that these creatures can
be domesticated even without the surgery.

25:38.846 --> 25:43.315
Knowing what they are, we can
begin to approach them properly,

25:43.350 --> 25:45.783
condition them,
control them.

25:45.818 --> 25:49.705
We've got to do this, Sarah.
It's our only hope.

26:00.466 --> 26:05.185
Yes, this is major cooper.

26:05.220 --> 26:10.342
I needed him, Sarah. He's helping us more
now than he ever did when he was alive.

26:10.843 --> 26:16.231
- But I saw the grave.
- They buried one of the specimens.

26:16.266 --> 26:19.450
Jesus. God, Logan.

26:19.485 --> 26:22.953
Do you know what they'll do to
you if they find out about this?

26:22.988 --> 26:26.992
- Do you know what they'll do to all of us?
- They'll never find out.

26:27.493 --> 26:30.746
He can't be recognized.

26:55.771 --> 26:59.708
Not a peep. Long-range or short,
high-band or low, I can't raise anybody.

26:59.743 --> 27:03.696
How can that be, McDermott? There
must be other groups like us.

27:03.731 --> 27:07.649
Somebody else must be tryin' to
radio. Yeah. What the hell is this?

27:07.684 --> 27:10.617
Maybe we are the only ones left.
I'm sure there's others.

27:10.652 --> 27:14.156
This is not the best place to be sending
from, and a lot of the equipment I知 using...

27:14.656 --> 27:17.159
has been rotting down here
since the second world war.

27:17.194 --> 27:20.377
Well, it's up to you
to get it workin' right.

27:20.412 --> 27:23.916
Lay off the fuckin' booze
for a while, why don't ya?

27:23.951 --> 27:26.919
And get somebody
on that fuckin' horn, pronto.

27:27.419 --> 27:31.924
Well, if we stay down here long enough, I値l
have to lay off the fuckin' booze, Steel,

27:31.959 --> 27:35.893
'cause there won't fuckin'
be any of it fuckin' left.

27:35.928 --> 27:41.433
In the meanwhile, I will continue to indulge
myself, and I will continue doing my best...

27:41.468 --> 27:44.401
in the good fight
against dry rot and rust.

27:44.436 --> 27:48.941
Yeah? Well, your best
ain't good enough, asshole.

27:49.441 --> 27:53.445
You think I知 not aware of our situation?
You think I want to stay isolated down here?

27:53.480 --> 27:55.965
You know, I壇 make a desperate
effort to raise somebody...

27:56.000 --> 27:58.450
just in the hope of gettin' away
from your nasty mouth, Steel.

27:58.485 --> 28:00.953
The fact is...

28:03.455 --> 28:06.008
the fact is...

28:07.042 --> 28:11.011
either we are
the only ones left...

28:11.046 --> 28:15.050
or there's nobody within range of my
puny little second world war signals.

28:15.085 --> 28:17.552
We used to talk to Washington all
the time. They could hear us then.

28:18.053 --> 28:20.520
We were on relays then.
We weren't over the air.

28:20.555 --> 28:23.558
You know, the power's off on the
mainland now, in case you haven't heard.

28:23.593 --> 28:29.529
All the shopping malls are closed.
We don't appreciate your jokes.

28:29.564 --> 28:33.568
Keep it up, and I値l shove that
bottle of yours right up your wise ass.

28:33.952 --> 28:37.456
I've got better things to do than listen
to this kindergarten. Are we finished?

28:37.491 --> 28:40.924
No, we ain't
finished here, lady. Sit down.

28:40.959 --> 28:44.428
What else do you want? We've given
you the reports for this week.

28:44.463 --> 28:47.950
We've given you everything you've
asked for. You've given us greek salad.

28:48.467 --> 28:53.472
Formulas, equations, a lot of
fancy terms that don't mean a thing.

28:53.972 --> 28:59.511
I wanna know if you're doin' something that's
gonna help us out of this deep shit we're in,

28:59.546 --> 29:03.981
or if you're all in there
just jerkin' each other off.

29:04.016 --> 29:08.487
She doesn't have to jerk off like the rest of
us, Captain. She got an honest-to-god dick...

29:08.522 --> 29:11.757
to get off on, huh?

29:11.792 --> 29:14.993
It may be yellow,
but it's still a dick!

29:17.612 --> 29:21.116
I said we ain't
finished here, lady.

29:21.151 --> 29:24.119
Sit down.

29:24.369 --> 29:27.372
Sit down, or so help me,
god, I値l have you shot.

29:29.875 --> 29:32.878
- You'll what?
- I said,

29:32.913 --> 29:35.846
"I値l have you shot. "

29:35.881 --> 29:39.384
Have you lost your mind?
No, ma'am.

29:41.887 --> 29:47.809
Have you? I just told you I was willing to
kill you if you didn't get back in your chair.

29:47.844 --> 29:50.744
You didn't get back
in your chair.

29:50.779 --> 29:53.965
Goddamn it! You can't
shove us around like this.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.152
Since when did this
become a military operation?

29:57.187 --> 30:02.657
Since I took over.
Steel, shoot that woman.

30:02.692 --> 30:06.161
Bang! You're dead.

30:13.802 --> 30:16.304
Shoot that woman
or you're dead.

30:16.805 --> 30:19.758
You think
I知 fuckin' around, Steel?

30:19.793 --> 30:23.226
You're wrong.

30:23.261 --> 30:27.399
Now, you got till a count of
five, and that's two you wasted.

30:27.434 --> 30:30.478
That's three.

30:30.513 --> 30:33.487
- Four.
- Sit down, Sarah.

30:33.522 --> 30:36.490
What is this?
Shut up and sit down.

30:36.525 --> 30:40.028
That's five, Steel.
All right.

30:40.063 --> 30:43.532
All right.

30:51.423 --> 30:55.177
No!

31:09.441 --> 31:15.447
Anybody else have any questions about the way
things are gonna run around here from now on?

31:28.210 --> 31:33.215
This ain't
a goddamn field trip, people.

31:33.250 --> 31:36.718
This is a fuckin' war!

31:36.968 --> 31:41.222
I'm not down in this cave for my
health. I'm down here on orders.

31:41.257 --> 31:45.442
Your orders are to facilitate
the job of this scientific team.

31:45.477 --> 31:50.482
This is a civilian team, and we don't
have to be subjected to your tyranny.

31:50.849 --> 31:54.602
Who's being subjected
to what, Fisher?

31:54.637 --> 31:57.998
You've lost one man.
Yeah. Right.

31:58.033 --> 32:01.324
We've lost five.

32:01.359 --> 32:06.364
Where does it say we gotta keep those
dumb fucks next door to where we sleep?

32:06.399 --> 32:11.369
Where does it say we should do any one
thing but shoot the mothers in the head?

32:11.404 --> 32:16.875
We don't have enough ammunition
to shoot them all in the head.

32:16.910 --> 32:19.845
The time to have done that
would've been at the beginning.

32:20.345 --> 32:25.350
No. We let them overrun us.
They have overrun us, you know.

32:26.351 --> 32:28.854
We're in the minority now.

32:29.354 --> 32:32.357
Something like 400,000
to one, by my calculations.

32:32.858 --> 32:35.325
I haven't eaten.
Is there food?

32:35.360 --> 32:39.329
You were supposed to be
here at 7:00 sharp, mister.

32:39.364 --> 32:42.617
I know. Sarah told me. I'm sorry. I
couldn't break away. Is there food?

32:42.652 --> 32:45.871
Listen, egghead, let me bring you
up to date on what's... excuse me.

32:45.906 --> 32:47.838
Let me...
excuse me!

32:47.873 --> 32:52.494
- Is there food?
- I'm runnin' this monkey farm now, Frankenstein,

32:52.529 --> 32:57.499
and I wanna know what the fuck
you're doin' with my time!

33:02.003 --> 33:04.697
'Cause if we're just
jerkin' off here,

33:04.732 --> 33:07.357
I知 gonna have my men
blow the piss...

33:07.392 --> 33:10.360
out of those precious specimens
of yours,

33:10.395 --> 33:15.767
And we're gonna get the hell out of here and
leave you and your highfalutin asshole friends...

33:15.802 --> 33:18.270
to rot
in this stinkin' sewer!

33:18.770 --> 33:21.273
Is that food enough for ya?

33:21.406 --> 33:27.244
Where will you go, Captain?
You can destroy my specimens,

33:27.279 --> 33:30.415
but what about the millions more
that are waiting to greet you outside?

33:30.450 --> 33:33.884
Do you really think you can
"blow the piss" out of them?

33:33.919 --> 33:38.924
All of them? They have you in a
hopeless situation, strategically.

33:38.959 --> 33:43.504
You're lost. Well,
you're lost unless...

33:43.539 --> 33:48.014
unless what? Unless what, Frankenstein?

33:48.049 --> 33:50.517
- Unless you can
make them behave.

33:50.552 --> 33:54.556
This is a fuckin' loony bin! I ain't bein'
paid enough to work in a fuckin' loony bin!

33:54.591 --> 33:58.944
- I ain't bein' paid at all!
- Paid? What the hell are they payin' him for?

33:58.979 --> 34:03.448
All right. Shut up!
Just shut up!

34:05.951 --> 34:09.454
What the hell are you
talkin' about, Frankenstein?

34:09.489 --> 34:12.922
I'll be able to show you
soon enough. Sarah knows.

34:12.958 --> 34:16.962
She's seen the progress I致e been
making. Isn't that right, Sarah?

34:16.996 --> 34:19.965
Yes. There's been some progress.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.433
What kind of progress?

34:23.467 --> 34:26.972
What are you talkin' about, "make
them behave"? What does that mean?

34:27.007 --> 34:30.225
It means keeping them from
wanting to eat us, for one thing.

34:30.342 --> 34:34.846
It means keeping them in
check, controlling them.

34:34.980 --> 34:39.484
- Controlling them.
- When are you gonna show us something we can understand?

34:39.985 --> 34:42.103
Very close. Very close.
I think in a matter of weeks...

34:42.603 --> 34:46.072
I don't think there's any way you can
tell how long anything is going to take.

34:46.107 --> 34:50.110
It could be months; it could be years before
we know exactly what we're dealing with.

34:50.146 --> 34:53.079
Sarah's research...

34:53.114 --> 34:58.585
Sarah's research
is more esoteric than mine.

34:58.620 --> 35:03.625
She's looking for a way to reverse the
process, a way to eradicate the problem.

35:03.660 --> 35:06.895
That could take a long time,
a very long time.

35:06.930 --> 35:09.782
She may never find
what she's looking for.

35:09.817 --> 35:12.634
We have a limited supply
of chemical agents.

35:13.134 --> 35:15.637
Our equipment
is hopelessly inadequate.

35:16.137 --> 35:21.276
McDermott doesn't
have decent radio gear.

35:21.776 --> 35:25.745
Now you're tellin' me that you
don't have the shit you need?

35:25.780 --> 35:30.034
We're runnin' low on ammunition. We're
runnin' low on men, for chrissakes!

35:30.069 --> 35:34.289
It was very rushed. This operation
was put together in a matter of days.

35:34.324 --> 35:38.560
Yeah, well, it can all be taken
apart in a matter of minutes, lady,

35:38.595 --> 35:42.797
and I知 here to tell you that
I知 ready to do that little thing.

35:42.832 --> 35:45.265
I'm ready to
take the next train outta here!

35:45.300 --> 35:48.268
I ask you again, Captain:
Where will you go?

35:48.303 --> 35:51.806
You have no choices. You'll have to
give us the weeks that we've asked for.

35:51.841 --> 35:55.775
You have to give us
however long it takes. Look.

35:55.810 --> 35:58.278
There have to be survivors
in Washington. My ass.

35:58.313 --> 36:00.780
They have more sophisticated
shelters than this one. Bullshit.

36:00.815 --> 36:04.819
There have to be people in those shelters
who know about us, who know where we are.

36:04.854 --> 36:07.322
With no radio contact,
they'll come looking for us.

36:07.357 --> 36:10.325
I said shut up!

36:23.838 --> 36:27.842
You got
a little more time.

36:28.343 --> 36:31.346
A little more.
I ain't sayin' how much.

36:33.848 --> 36:39.354
But you'd better start showin' me some
results, and you'd better not piss me off.

36:39.389 --> 36:44.859
You understand? Nothin' happens around
here without my knowin' about it!

36:46.861 --> 36:51.948
And anybody fucks
with my command,

36:51.983 --> 36:57.989
they get court-martialed,
they get executed.

37:02.494 --> 37:06.498
You'd better know
I mean it, too, people.

37:16.124 --> 37:20.845
He wouldn't have done it.
I can't believe he would've.

37:20.880 --> 37:24.814
No, he wouldn't
have done it.

37:24.849 --> 37:29.354
- He would've had Steel do it.
- He can't be that inhuman.

37:29.389 --> 37:34.324
No. He's human. That's
what scares me, you know.

37:34.359 --> 37:39.864
He won't shoot Billy 'cause he doesn't
have anybody else who knows electronics.

37:39.899 --> 37:43.833
He won't shoot me,
'cause I知 his ride.

37:43.868 --> 37:49.374
He probably won't shoot old Frankenstein,
'cause the old doc can talk him silly.

37:50.375 --> 37:52.842
But the rest of you...

37:52.877 --> 37:56.381
better start worrying,
you know.

38:02.637 --> 38:06.641
Maybe if we tried working together,
we could ease some of the tensions.

38:06.676 --> 38:10.645
- We're all pulling in different directions.
- That's the trouble, Sarah.

38:11.145 --> 38:15.149
People got different ideas
concerning what they want out of life.

38:57.325 --> 39:01.329
You are afraid,
aren't you?

39:02.413 --> 39:05.984
Just as afraid as I am.

39:08.503 --> 39:10.972
Why don't you take a sedative,
Sarah, so you can sleep?

39:13.541 --> 39:18.463
You're full of shit, Sarah, you know
that? You're really full of shit.

39:18.498 --> 39:22.276
I'm through with you.

39:22.311 --> 39:26.054
Fine then. Get out.

39:26.089 --> 39:29.057
Just get out!

40:33.287 --> 40:37.792
- Hey, guys! Come on, man!
- For goodness sake!

40:46.551 --> 40:50.555
I'm all right.
Thanks, bill.

40:51.055 --> 40:54.524
I'm all right.
Here.

40:54.559 --> 40:57.061
I've just filled it up.
Got a refill as well.

40:57.096 --> 40:59.831
No, thanks.
I'm all right. Really.

40:59.866 --> 41:02.567
It's just brandy.
Good for the heart.

41:03.067 --> 41:06.070
It's shit for your heart,
and it eats up your liver.

41:55.837 --> 41:59.841
We don't get a lot of visitors
out here, and we like it that way.

42:01.342 --> 42:04.846
Here it is: The Ritz.

42:04.881 --> 42:06.848
Madam.

42:14.222 --> 42:17.225
John's probably
out the back.

42:27.368 --> 42:30.996
Hey! Well,
what do you know.

42:31.031 --> 42:35.080
Welcome
to civilization, Sarah.

42:35.115 --> 42:39.130
The last holdout.
It's pretty nice.

42:40.131 --> 42:43.134
Nicer than we got inside.

42:44.635 --> 42:49.105
- Not a bad idea.
- It's a little safer where you are.

42:49.140 --> 42:51.642
But we like to live dangerously,
Billy boy and me, you know.

42:52.143 --> 42:57.148
That's a laugh. I haven't seen you do
anything dangerous since we got here.

42:57.183 --> 43:01.652
We stickin' around.
That's gettin' a bit dangerous,

43:01.687 --> 43:05.156
as I hope you noticed
this evening.

43:08.142 --> 43:10.661
You're a mystery to me.

43:11.662 --> 43:13.664
You really are.

43:15.166 --> 43:18.669
Not like
those other goons in there.

43:18.704 --> 43:23.191
You have a sense of...

43:23.226 --> 43:27.643
Of what?
Never mind.

43:27.678 --> 43:30.646
No, no, no. Come on.
Let's talk about it.

43:30.681 --> 43:33.149
I came down here to get
drunk. I don't have the energy.

43:33.184 --> 43:39.190
Hey, hey. It takes more energy to keep
quiet than it does to speak the mind.

43:39.225 --> 43:42.693
Go ahead. Let go of what you got, now.

43:44.695 --> 43:47.163
You were sent down here
to do a job.

43:47.198 --> 43:51.702
My job is to fly the whirlybird.
I've been doin' that job just fine.

43:52.203 --> 43:55.206
You have the protection of this facility.
You eat our food. You drink our water.

43:55.241 --> 43:59.210
And you don't lift a finger
to help. Neither one of you.

44:14.225 --> 44:18.194
We don't believe in what
you're doin' here, Sarah.

44:18.229 --> 44:22.198
Hey, you know what all they
keep down here in this cave?

44:22.233 --> 44:27.738
Man, they got the books and the
records of the top 500 companies.

44:27.773 --> 44:31.207
They got the defense department
budget down here.

44:31.242 --> 44:34.245
And they got the negative
for all your favorite movies.

44:34.745 --> 44:39.617
They got microfilm with tax
return and newspaper stories.

44:39.652 --> 44:42.620
They got immigration records,
census reports,

44:43.120 --> 44:45.623
and they got official accounts of
all the wars and plane crashes...

44:45.658 --> 44:49.592
and volcano eruptions and
earthquakes and fires and floods...

44:49.627 --> 44:53.130
and all the other disasters that
interrupted the flow of things...

44:53.165 --> 44:56.599
in the good old U.S. Of A.

44:56.634 --> 45:00.137
Now, what does it matter,
Sarah darling?

45:00.638 --> 45:03.189
All this filing
and record keeping?

45:03.224 --> 45:08.479
We ever gonna give a shit? We even
gonna get a chance to see it all?

45:10.364 --> 45:14.869
This is a great big
14-mile tombstone!

45:14.986 --> 45:17.536
Tombstone!

45:17.571 --> 45:21.742
With an epitaph on it that
nobody gonna bother to read.

45:22.126 --> 45:25.630
Now, here you come... here you come
with a whole new set of charts...

45:25.665 --> 45:28.097
and graphs and records.

45:28.132 --> 45:32.136
What you gonna do? Bury them down
here with all the other relics...

45:32.171 --> 45:34.138
of what once was?

45:36.624 --> 45:40.561
Let me tell you what else. Yeah,
I知 gonna tell you what else.

45:41.062 --> 45:46.567
You ain't never gonna figure it out,
just like they never figured out...

45:46.602 --> 45:49.535
why the stars
are where they're at.

45:49.570 --> 45:54.058
It ain't mankind's job
to figure that stuff out.

45:54.575 --> 45:57.695
So what you're doin'
is a waste of time, Sarah.

45:58.195 --> 46:00.698
And time is all
we got left, you know.

46:02.083 --> 46:07.588
What I知 doing...
is all there's left to do.

46:07.623 --> 46:10.541
Shame on you.
There's plenty to do.

46:11.042 --> 46:16.180
Plenty to do. So long as there's you
and me and maybe some other people,

46:16.681 --> 46:21.150
we could start over, start
fresh, get some babies.

46:21.185 --> 46:25.690
And teach 'em, Sarah, teach
'em never to come over here...

46:25.725 --> 46:30.061
and dig these records out.

46:33.531 --> 46:35.498
Hey.

46:35.533 --> 46:41.038
You want to put some kind
of explanation...

46:41.073 --> 46:44.757
down here
before you leave?

46:44.792 --> 46:48.796
Here's one as good as
any you're likely to find.

46:51.499 --> 46:55.002
We're being punished
by the creator.

46:56.504 --> 46:59.507
He visited a curse
on us...

47:00.508 --> 47:04.011
so we man could look at...

47:10.518 --> 47:13.020
what hell was like.

47:16.023 --> 47:20.027
Maybe didn't want to see us
blow ourselves up...

47:20.062 --> 47:23.996
and put a big hole
in his sky.

47:24.031 --> 47:29.536
Maybe he just wanted to show
us he was still the boss man.

47:29.571 --> 47:35.042
Maybe he figure... we was getting
too big for our britches...

47:36.043 --> 47:40.047
trying to
figure his shit out.

48:30.264 --> 48:33.767
You son of a bitch!

48:36.270 --> 48:39.273
Damn it!

48:40.274 --> 48:43.242
It's no good.

48:43.277 --> 48:47.781
It's no fuckin' good.
What is that stuff?

48:48.282 --> 48:50.284
It's something called beef treats,
which the army provides us with...

48:50.784 --> 48:52.286
so generously.

48:52.786 --> 48:55.289
- He won't touch it.
- Shit. I wouldn't either.

48:55.324 --> 48:58.257
Sorry. We're fresh out
of filet mignon.

48:58.292 --> 49:01.679
- What is this?
Part of Logan's plan...

49:01.714 --> 49:05.182
to try
and socialize these things?

49:05.299 --> 49:09.803
He told me himself they don't eat for
nourishment. What are we hoping for here?

49:09.838 --> 49:14.058
Hoping to satisfy the urge.
You see, Sarah, they're...

49:14.093 --> 49:17.526
they are us. They are
the extensions of us.

49:17.561 --> 49:23.165
They are the same animal, simply
functioning less perfectly.

49:23.200 --> 49:27.821
They can be fooled, you see? They can be
tricked into being good little girls and boys,

49:27.856 --> 49:32.826
the same way we were tricked into it
on the promise of some reward to come.

49:32.861 --> 49:35.294
They have to be rewarded.

49:35.329 --> 49:38.832
Reward is the key.
I'm convinced of that now.

49:38.867 --> 49:40.968
Come. I've got something
to show you.

49:49.593 --> 49:54.098
That wasn't very nice, you know.
That wasn't very nice at all.

49:54.598 --> 49:57.066
Let's go.

49:57.101 --> 50:02.856
And you can just sit there in the
dark and think about what you've done.

50:03.240 --> 50:06.243
Think about it.
Think.

50:18.756 --> 50:22.725
I call him Bub.

50:22.760 --> 50:28.132
That's what the club fellas used to call my
father. Can you imagine a surgeon called Bub?

50:28.167 --> 50:31.518
Nobody seemed to mind,
though. He was rich.

50:31.553 --> 50:34.486
My father was rich.

50:34.521 --> 50:39.026
He used to say I壇 never
be rich doing pure research.

50:39.061 --> 50:42.029
I'd never be rich.

50:42.529 --> 50:46.533
Uh, Bub's been responding so
well lately, I致e let him live.

50:48.535 --> 50:53.540
Well, is he alive or dead? Well, that's
the question these days, isn't it?

50:53.575 --> 50:58.045
Well, let's say that I
let him continue to exist.

50:58.080 --> 51:01.513
Hello, Bub!

51:01.548 --> 51:05.802
Here are some toys for you.

51:05.837 --> 51:10.057
Some nice things
for you to play with.

51:12.059 --> 51:16.313
You remember them from
before? From before.

51:22.069 --> 51:25.439
Well, he's seen the other things
before, but the book is new.

51:36.083 --> 51:39.086
Look, look, look.

52:11.735 --> 52:16.240
I thought he'd do that.

52:26.884 --> 52:29.887
Open it up.

52:32.389 --> 52:35.392
He remembers. He remembers
everything that he used to.

52:39.930 --> 52:44.935
Bub, I知 very pleased.
Very pleased.

52:44.970 --> 52:47.903
What's he trying
to prove?

52:47.938 --> 52:50.441
I saw one of those things
sittin' in a car in d. C...

52:50.941 --> 52:53.909
tryin' to drive
down independence avenue.

52:53.944 --> 52:56.947
It didn't make me wanna be
its friend. No. It's amazing.

52:56.982 --> 52:59.450
It's not what this one does,
but what he doesn't do.

52:59.485 --> 53:01.917
What do you mean?
He doesn't get excited...

53:01.952 --> 53:05.456
and doesn't get agitated
when Logan walks in the room.

53:05.491 --> 53:09.960
He doesn't see Logan as... lunch.

53:10.461 --> 53:13.929
Dinner.
Breakfast.

53:13.964 --> 53:19.937
Having fun? What's he doin' in there?

53:21.555 --> 53:23.557
No need for that, Captain.
He's quite docile.

53:24.558 --> 53:28.061
Come in.
You can all come in.

53:28.096 --> 53:30.063
Bub won't mind.

53:56.340 --> 53:59.843
Extraordinary,
isn't it?

54:10.854 --> 54:13.822
That's right, Bub.
Say hello.

54:13.857 --> 54:16.360
Come on, Captain. Give
me a break, will ya?

54:16.395 --> 54:20.364
Say hello
to your aunt Alicia.

54:20.399 --> 54:22.866
Say, "hello, aunt Alicia. "

54:23.367 --> 54:26.835
"Hello, aunt Alicia. "

54:26.870 --> 54:31.875
Hel-lo, aunt Alicia.
"Hello. "

54:47.391 --> 54:52.396
Apparently, he was in the military.
Return the salute and see what he does.

54:52.431 --> 54:56.900
You want me to salute
that pile of walking pus?

54:56.935 --> 54:59.368
Salute my ass.

54:59.403 --> 55:03.372
Your ignorance is exceeded
only by your charm, Captain.

55:03.407 --> 55:08.412
How are we going to set an example
for them if we behave barbarically?

55:08.545 --> 55:11.548
Take the bullets out, please, and
let me have your pistol, Sarah.

55:45.699 --> 55:49.167
It's empty, Captain. We
saw the bullets come out.

55:49.202 --> 55:53.173
Let's see what he does. Let's see
what Bub does in this situation.

56:04.685 --> 56:08.522
Jesus... Christ.

56:23.036 --> 56:28.041
What are we supposed to do?
Teach 'em tricks?

56:28.542 --> 56:32.796
What the fuck is wrong with
you people? They're dead!

56:32.831 --> 56:37.050
They're fucking dead, and
you wanna teach 'em tricks?

56:37.551 --> 56:42.556
They have to be rewarded, Captain. Why
else will they do what we want them to do?

56:42.591 --> 56:44.773
I don't want 'em
to do anything but drop over!

56:44.808 --> 56:47.811
Yes, well, apparently they're not
inclined to do that for you, Captain.

56:47.846 --> 56:51.530
Is this your progress?

56:51.565 --> 56:55.033
Is this the shit that's
supposed to knock our socks off?

56:55.068 --> 57:00.574
It's the beginning, yes. It's the
bare beginning of social behavior.

57:01.575 --> 57:04.543
Of civilized behavior.

57:04.578 --> 57:08.582
Civil behavior is what distinguishes
us from the lower forms.

57:08.617 --> 57:13.051
It's what enables us
to communicate,

57:13.086 --> 57:18.342
to go about things in an orderly fashion,
without attacking each other like beasts.

57:18.709 --> 57:22.713
Civility must be rewarded,
Captain.

57:23.714 --> 57:26.967
If it isn't rewarded,

57:27.002 --> 57:30.185
there's no use for it.

57:30.220 --> 57:33.724
There's just no use
for it at all.

57:43.734 --> 57:47.237
'Possum ready?

57:48.739 --> 57:51.742
Come on. Grab it.
Come on.

57:51.777 --> 57:53.709
You got it?

57:53.744 --> 57:57.247
Hey. You got it?

58:08.508 --> 58:11.511
No!

58:18.518 --> 58:22.487
No! No!

58:22.522 --> 58:25.025
Miller! Miller!

58:33.417 --> 58:39.388
I can't do it.
I can't do it!

58:39.423 --> 58:43.543
I can't do it.

59:05.315 --> 59:08.784
Don't let this happen.

59:08.819 --> 59:13.707
Don't let this happen to me.
I don't wanna be one of them.

59:13.742 --> 59:18.712
Take me. Please. Take me.

01:00:13.016 --> 01:00:16.019
I need fire.

01:01:10.574 --> 01:01:13.076
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

01:01:23.587 --> 01:01:26.089
Get out of the way, lady.

01:01:26.456 --> 01:01:30.961
No. I amputated the infected
area. I think I caught it in time.

01:01:31.461 --> 01:01:34.429
Yeah?
But what if you didn't?

01:01:34.464 --> 01:01:37.350
If I didn't,
I値l shoot him myself.

01:01:37.385 --> 01:01:39.684
It's the spick.

01:01:39.719 --> 01:01:44.224
The yellow son of a bitch. It's his fault
this happened. It's his yellow fuckin' fault.

01:01:44.259 --> 01:01:48.228
Get out of the way, bitch, or I値l
go right through you with this.

01:01:52.732 --> 01:01:58.238
We're getting to make this a habit, man...
pointing guns at each other, you know.

01:01:58.488 --> 01:02:00.991
We just lost two men
'cause of this motherfucker.

01:02:01.124 --> 01:02:05.093
Weli... that kinda evens
the odds between us then.

01:02:05.128 --> 01:02:08.632
The spick's been bit, Captain.
We gotta blast him.

01:02:08.667 --> 01:02:12.002
He's been bit! I got
the infection in time.

01:02:12.037 --> 01:02:14.603
That's bullshit, lady.

01:02:14.638 --> 01:02:18.591
I seen a thousand of 'em.
He's gonna die.

01:02:18.626 --> 01:02:22.095
If he dies,
I値l destroy him myself.

01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:25.098
Unless he gets you first.

01:02:27.484 --> 01:02:30.487
You may still want to sleep
with him.

01:02:30.522 --> 01:02:33.132
I don't want him
inside the complex.

01:02:33.167 --> 01:02:35.742
We'll keep him out here,
with us.

01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:40.363
We gotta blast him,
Captain.

01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:52.092
That'd be doin' 'im a favor,
Steel.

01:02:53.343 --> 01:02:56.346
You think he wants
to walk around after he's dead?

01:02:56.381 --> 01:02:59.349
You think he wants to be
one of those things?

01:03:00.583 --> 01:03:03.518
Think about it, lady.

01:03:03.553 --> 01:03:06.521
And think about this,
all of ya...

01:03:06.556 --> 01:03:09.524
from now on, you ain't gettin'
shit from me and my men.

01:03:09.559 --> 01:03:13.563
Tomorrow morning, we're going inside
that corral, and we ain't comin' out...

01:03:13.598 --> 01:03:18.018
till every one of those rotten
piles of garbage has been wasted.

01:03:23.039 --> 01:03:25.542
Come on, Steel.

01:03:34.050 --> 01:03:38.054
Get out of there, Steel!
We got better things to do!

01:03:42.559 --> 01:03:45.562
You're on my shit list,
flyboy.

01:04:03.079 --> 01:04:05.081
Thank you.

01:04:06.583 --> 01:04:09.586
Let's take him inside,
clean him up.

01:04:09.621 --> 01:04:11.588
Think you can move him?

01:04:14.090 --> 01:04:16.092
I- I think so.

01:04:35.612 --> 01:04:39.115
It's all right.
It's okay.

01:04:40.617 --> 01:04:42.619
Shh, shh, shh.

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:46.122
Shh, shh.

01:05:06.509 --> 01:05:10.513
- It's a man's sweater. Try it on.
- Thanks.

01:05:15.518 --> 01:05:18.021
I have to go to the lab.

01:05:19.522 --> 01:05:21.524
He's going to need
some morphine...

01:05:22.025 --> 01:05:23.992
along with
some other supplies.

01:05:24.027 --> 01:05:29.532
I'd better go along. I'm sure those
boys haven't calmed themselves down yet.

01:05:32.669 --> 01:05:34.671
I'm sorry I said
those things about you.

01:05:35.171 --> 01:05:38.174
I'm sorry too. Really.

01:05:38.209 --> 01:05:40.694
Well, what do you know?

01:05:40.729 --> 01:05:43.179
We are heroes after all.

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:45.682
What a relief.

01:05:58.695 --> 01:06:00.697
Sarah.

01:06:01.197 --> 01:06:04.200
He might not make it,
you know.

01:06:04.235 --> 01:06:06.703
I know it.

01:06:08.204 --> 01:06:10.206
At least we gave him
a chance.

01:06:10.241 --> 01:06:13.209
I'll keep an eye on him.

01:06:13.244 --> 01:06:15.176
Hey.

01:06:15.211 --> 01:06:19.716
You guys be careful. You're not back in
half an hour, I知 coming out to look for you.

01:06:19.751 --> 01:06:22.218
They'll leave us alone.

01:06:24.721 --> 01:06:26.973
Half an hour.

01:06:27.008 --> 01:06:29.225
We'll be back.

01:06:51.748 --> 01:06:54.215
Jesus god almighty.

01:06:54.250 --> 01:06:58.755
The resident surgeon has been
burning the midnight oils.

01:07:05.511 --> 01:07:08.514
What the hell has he been doin'
down here, slaughtering cattle?

01:07:09.015 --> 01:07:12.018
In his mind, that's probably
not far from the truth.

01:07:33.656 --> 01:07:36.124
Grandfather's talking.
His mind's talking.

01:07:36.159 --> 01:07:41.414
There. I've put it away. I've put
it away, mother. I've put it away.

01:07:43.416 --> 01:07:47.920
- Bastard. Be civilized!
Be civil.

01:07:47.955 --> 01:07:50.923
Christ! Take that off.

01:07:51.424 --> 01:07:56.429
Take that off! Take that off!

01:07:56.464 --> 01:08:00.066
Five minutes, mother.
Just five minutes.

01:08:01.818 --> 01:08:08.825
Oh, my god.

01:08:12.238 --> 01:08:15.296
No, Sarah! Don't!

01:08:15.331 --> 01:08:17.834
It'll just bring out
Rhodes and the men.

01:08:17.868 --> 01:08:20.336
Leave it be,
leave it be.

01:08:22.337 --> 01:08:25.807
Let's go.
Let's get outta here.

01:08:25.841 --> 01:08:30.846
I'm beginning to think we should take
that helicopter before somebody else does.

01:08:52.019 --> 01:08:53.986
Hello, Bub.

01:09:00.743 --> 01:09:03.246
Mother is very proud
of you.

01:09:03.281 --> 01:09:06.015
Very, very proud indeed.

01:09:06.051 --> 01:09:08.751
You did quite nicely today.

01:10:36.339 --> 01:10:40.593
I don't believe it.
Logan's star pupil.

01:10:42.845 --> 01:10:47.099
- Now, tomorrow, we can play
with these things again.

01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:51.103
Now it's time
for your reward.

01:10:52.989 --> 01:10:54.991
I brought you
something good.

01:11:11.624 --> 01:11:13.876
What is that?

01:11:13.911 --> 01:11:16.128
Is that...

01:11:20.016 --> 01:11:22.385
it can't be.

01:11:23.386 --> 01:11:27.890
Oh, god. I can't look.
Can't...

01:11:34.146 --> 01:11:39.151
Good night, Bub.

01:11:39.652 --> 01:11:43.155
What are you givin' him in
there, Frankenstein? What?

01:11:43.190 --> 01:11:46.542
- What is it, huh?

01:11:49.045 --> 01:11:51.047
What do you give him?

01:12:03.059 --> 01:12:05.526
Scum!

01:12:05.561 --> 01:12:10.066
No, you... you must listen to me,
Captain. You must listen.

01:12:10.101 --> 01:12:12.068
Listen to this.

01:12:19.692 --> 01:12:22.194
Hold it, Fisher.

01:12:22.229 --> 01:12:24.714
Torrez, get his gun.

01:12:24.749 --> 01:12:27.164
Take all the guns.

01:12:27.199 --> 01:12:31.704
All of 'em.
All their fucking guns!

01:12:31.739 --> 01:12:33.589
Take all their guns.

01:12:34.090 --> 01:12:36.092
All their guns!

01:12:37.093 --> 01:12:40.061
Those are my men in there.

01:12:40.096 --> 01:12:44.100
My men.
Those are my men in there!

01:13:40.523 --> 01:13:43.159
Hold it right there.

01:13:45.661 --> 01:13:48.129
Frankenstein's dead.

01:13:48.164 --> 01:13:52.668
This scum gets it next unless you
throw your weapons out right now.

01:13:52.703 --> 01:13:55.171
He means it, Johnny. He
killed Logan in cold blood.

01:13:55.206 --> 01:13:59.140
I killed Logan
because he was a butcher.

01:13:59.175 --> 01:14:03.679
I'll kill the rest of them one at a time,
unless you get your black ass out here, flyboy.

01:14:21.447 --> 01:14:26.452
- Let him go, Rhodes.
- Torrez, get his machete.

01:14:29.455 --> 01:14:31.922
We're gettin' outta here
right now.

01:14:31.957 --> 01:14:34.960
You give me any shit about it,
I blow his head off.

01:14:34.995 --> 01:14:37.428
Whirlybird can't
hold us all.

01:14:37.463 --> 01:14:42.468
"Us all" ain't going.
Me, my men, you. That's it.

01:14:42.585 --> 01:14:44.587
You'll never get me to do that,
Rhodes.

01:14:47.973 --> 01:14:50.441
No!
Hey!

01:14:50.476 --> 01:14:55.981
Rickles, open the gates.
Steel, shove 'em in there.

01:15:03.105 --> 01:15:05.608
Have a nice visit
with McDermott, huh?

01:15:10.613 --> 01:15:16.118
Rhodes...
don't do this, please.

01:15:16.619 --> 01:15:19.086
Gonna give us a ride,
flyboy?

01:15:19.121 --> 01:15:23.125
I'll do whatever you say, man.
Let her go now.

01:15:30.132 --> 01:15:33.100
Rhodes. Let 'em off.

01:15:33.135 --> 01:15:37.139
I'll take you...
wherever you want to go.

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:41.644
Like you said,
chopper can't hold us all.

01:15:45.648 --> 01:15:47.650
Rhodes, don't do it.

01:15:49.151 --> 01:15:51.619
You do it, and I won't fly.

01:15:51.654 --> 01:15:55.658
I swear, you got to kill me
before I fly.

01:15:59.662 --> 01:16:04.166
Let 'em out.
That's the deal.

01:16:06.669 --> 01:16:10.638
I make the deals around here,
not you.

01:16:10.673 --> 01:16:14.677
Now you get your shit together,
whatever you need.

01:16:14.712 --> 01:16:17.144
Isn't there
an old silo back there?

01:16:17.179 --> 01:16:19.647
No. We can't go back there
without guns.

01:16:19.682 --> 01:16:23.185
- We can't stay here. They'll tear us apart.
- Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

01:16:25.938 --> 01:16:27.940
Don't shoot 'im!

01:16:29.441 --> 01:16:32.444
We need his ass.

01:16:34.697 --> 01:16:36.699
Steel, kick him around
a little bit.

01:16:38.701 --> 01:16:42.705
Might knock some sense
into that jungle-bunny head.

01:16:52.798 --> 01:16:57.303
- Captain!
- That's it.

01:16:57.338 --> 01:16:59.305
Run, you fuckin' lunatics.

01:17:02.343 --> 01:17:04.577
Oh!

01:17:28.584 --> 01:17:33.589
They're gone, flyboy.
Let's go.

01:17:33.624 --> 01:17:37.057
Not a chance.

01:17:41.096 --> 01:17:44.099
- Jesus Christ. That's the elevator.
- Check it out.

01:18:34.650 --> 01:18:37.117
Aw, Jesus.

01:18:37.152 --> 01:18:39.655
Rock slide.
We can't get through.

01:18:41.156 --> 01:18:44.159
This way.
We can try and get around.

01:19:31.206 --> 01:19:33.709
Oh, it's you.
This way.

01:19:43.469 --> 01:19:45.971
Let's go, Torrez. Get up.

01:20:27.429 --> 01:20:30.647
Aw, shit!
Somebody took this apart.

01:20:30.682 --> 01:20:34.686
The only other control's up on
the platform with a hand box.

01:20:34.721 --> 01:20:37.404
Stuck.

01:20:37.439 --> 01:20:42.444
- Rickles, we can't get out of here.
- Fix it. Can't you fix it?

01:20:42.479 --> 01:20:46.949
It's that fuckin' spick
that did this! Fix it!

01:20:46.984 --> 01:20:49.416
Come on, man!
Fix what?

01:20:49.451 --> 01:20:54.456
Fix the box, man! Come on!
Fix it! They tore the guts out!

01:20:54.491 --> 01:20:56.959
I can't fix it! We got the
book here! We can fix it!

01:21:09.605 --> 01:21:11.590
The bastard.

01:21:24.319 --> 01:21:26.455
Sarah!

01:21:27.656 --> 01:21:29.908
Willie!

01:21:31.410 --> 01:21:33.912
John!

01:21:59.438 --> 01:22:01.440
Let's keep moving.

01:23:19.436 --> 01:23:21.904
Hold down. Aw, fuck!

01:23:22.404 --> 01:23:25.372
What's goin' on?
That spick.

01:23:25.407 --> 01:23:27.659
He ripped these controls out,
the little yellow bastard.

01:23:27.694 --> 01:23:31.995
The little shit.

01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:34.498
The little fuckin' shit.

01:23:34.533 --> 01:23:37.536
You tried to make
a run for it.

01:24:12.204 --> 01:24:14.206
Holy shit.

01:24:14.706 --> 01:24:17.709
Holy fuckin' shit.

01:24:43.986 --> 01:24:46.989
Rhodes!

01:24:47.024 --> 01:24:49.992
Rhodes, you bastard!

01:27:17.088 --> 01:27:18.723
Oh, shit!

01:27:23.845 --> 01:27:26.848
Shit!

01:27:30.485 --> 01:27:32.487
Fuck!

01:27:36.858 --> 01:27:39.494
Ha, ha!

01:27:43.498 --> 01:27:47.502
Holy shit!

01:28:31.413 --> 01:28:33.415
Shit!

01:28:34.916 --> 01:28:37.384
Rhodes! Goddamn, Rhodes!

01:28:37.419 --> 01:28:40.422
Open the door,
you son of a bitch!

01:28:42.674 --> 01:28:44.809
Rhodes!

01:29:34.359 --> 01:29:36.861
Shit!

01:29:45.236 --> 01:29:47.704
Come on, Bub.

01:29:47.739 --> 01:29:51.242
Come on, you pus-brained
bag of shit.

01:29:51.743 --> 01:29:56.247
You wanna learn how to shoot,
Bub? I'll teach you how to shoot.

01:29:56.381 --> 01:29:58.883
Come on, you bag of...

01:30:39.708 --> 01:30:43.712
Oh!

01:30:57.859 --> 01:31:00.862
Let's go. Follow the red lights.

01:31:13.992 --> 01:31:18.880
- It's temporarily out of service.
- The ladder! Go ahead. Up, up.

01:31:18.915 --> 01:31:20.882
Up!

01:31:52.530 --> 01:31:54.998
Come along, Johnny.

01:31:55.033 --> 01:31:59.537
We're countin' on ya
to fly us to the promised land.

01:32:36.324 --> 01:32:39.711
Come on, come on.
Come on!

01:32:39.746 --> 01:32:42.714
Oh, shit!

01:32:55.727 --> 01:32:57.979
You fuck.

01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:12.494
You pus fuck! You fuck!

01:33:14.996 --> 01:33:19.000
You pus fuck! You pus fuck!

01:33:28.009 --> 01:33:30.512
You f...

01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:44.142
Come on!

01:33:45.143 --> 01:33:48.646
Come on! Come o-o-on!

01:33:51.282 --> 01:33:54.285
Come o-o-on!

01:33:55.286 --> 01:33:57.288
Come o-o-on!

01:34:00.291 --> 01:34:02.794
Come o-o-on!

01:34:03.795 --> 01:34:05.762
Come o-o-on!

01:34:50.842 --> 01:34:58.850
Salazar!

01:36:15.293 --> 01:36:18.796
Let's hope they filled up the
gas tank from the other night.

01:36:19.931 --> 01:36:22.934
Oh, my god.
Come on, come on!

01:36:37.565 --> 01:36:40.068
Get in, get in!
