WEBVTT

00:07.378 --> 00:09.380
OH, I LOVE HISTORY CLASS!

00:09.380 --> 00:12.643
SOMEONE IS ALWAYS LEAVING ME
A LITTLE PIECE OF GUM
STUCK UNDER MY DESK.

00:12.643 --> 00:14.615
ADAM, PLEASE TELL ME
YOU DIDN'T.

00:16.547 --> 00:17.588
( bubble pops )

00:17.588 --> 00:19.490
HE DID. HE TOTALLY DID.
 MM-HMM.

00:20.791 --> 00:22.323
OH. GUYS, DON'T LOOK NOW,

00:22.323 --> 00:24.695
BUT HERE COMES THAT GUY
NONE OF US LIKE. MARCUS.

00:24.695 --> 00:27.298
All: M-DOG!
 HEY, HEY!

00:27.298 --> 00:28.699
WHAT'S UP!

00:28.699 --> 00:30.661
WAIT. HOLD THE PHONE.

00:30.661 --> 00:31.602
HOLD THE PHONE,

00:31.602 --> 00:34.805
HOLD THE FREAKY-DEAKY PHONE.

00:34.805 --> 00:37.168
"M-DOG"?
 YEAH.

00:37.168 --> 00:39.340
BRO'S CALL EACH OTHER
BY NICKNAMES.

00:39.340 --> 00:43.344
WELL, I'M YOUR ACTUAL BRO
AND YOU DON'T CALL ME
BY A NICKNAME.

00:43.344 --> 00:47.047
ACTUALLY, WE DO.
WE JUST CHOOSE NOT TO
DO IT IN YOUR PRESENCE.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.820
MR. TINY McLITTLESTEIN.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.655
HEY, MARCUS, WHAT ARE YOU
UP TO THIS WEEKEND?

00:54.655 --> 00:58.589
MY DAD'S OUT OF TOWN
SO I'LL BE STUCK HOME ALONE
WITH MY GRANDMA.

00:58.589 --> 00:59.730
AHA!

00:59.730 --> 01:02.693
YOU SAID YOUR GRANDMA WAS DEAD.

01:03.694 --> 01:05.636
THE OTHER GRANDMA.

01:05.636 --> 01:08.369
BUT THANKS FOR REMINDING ME.

01:08.369 --> 01:10.601
OOH.

01:10.601 --> 01:12.703
I WISH I COULD
STAY WITH YOU GUYS
FOR THE WEEKEND.

01:12.703 --> 01:16.747
AND I WISH YOU WEREN'T
A SPASTIC SOCIOPATH WITH
ABANDONMENT ISSUES.

01:18.579 --> 01:21.612
LEO, GIVE IT A REST.

01:21.612 --> 01:24.385
CHASE, NONE OF US ARE SAFE
UNTIL THE FBI RESPONDS

01:24.385 --> 01:27.818
TO MY REQUEST
FOR A BACKGROUND CHECK
ON THIS "M-DOG."

01:29.660 --> 01:32.563
LOOK, MARCUS, I'M SURE
YOU CAN STAY WITH US.

01:32.563 --> 01:34.365
I'LL JUST CHECK
WITH MR. DAVENPORT.

01:34.365 --> 01:36.727
YOU CALL YOUR DAD
"MR. DAVENPORT"?

01:36.727 --> 01:39.400
UH, NO. PSSH. NO.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.802
BUT YOU DO,
 AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE

01:41.802 --> 01:45.376
YOU KNEW WHO I WAS
 TALKING ABOUT.

01:45.376 --> 01:48.709
OKAY. COOL.
THANKS, GUYS.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.541
( bell rings )
 BREE, WATCH OUT!

01:52.483 --> 01:55.346
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
 DID YOU JUST...?

01:55.346 --> 01:57.618
I THINK I JUST MOVED
THAT BALL WITH MY MIND.

01:57.618 --> 02:01.222
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU COULD DO THAT.
 NEITHER DID I.

02:01.222 --> 02:04.695
MAN, IF YOU CAN DO THAT
WITH YOUR MIND, I WONDER
WHAT I CAN DO WITH MINE.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.759
WE'VE BEEN WONDERING THAT
FOR YEARS.

02:11.562 --> 02:14.665
THE WORLD'S FIRST
BIONIC SUPERHUMANS.

02:14.665 --> 02:18.469
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,
FASTER, SMARTER.

02:18.469 --> 02:21.312
THE NEXT GENERATION
OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

02:21.312 --> 02:23.574
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?!

02:23.574 --> 02:25.646
♪♪

02:28.249 --> 02:29.620
WHOO-HOO!

02:31.882 --> 02:33.654
( all screaming )

03:02.583 --> 03:04.355
CHASE, THIS IS AMAZING.

03:04.355 --> 03:05.886
YOU CAN MOVE THINGS
WITH YOUR MIND!

03:05.886 --> 03:07.888
YOU'RE LIKE
A REALLY COOL MAGICIAN.

03:07.888 --> 03:10.961
YOU KNOW, IF THERE WAS
 SUCH A THING AS
A REALLY COOL MAGICIAN.

03:10.961 --> 03:15.496
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
IT WAS PROBABLY JUST A FLUKE.

03:15.496 --> 03:18.369
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
EVERYTHING AROUND ME

03:18.369 --> 03:20.601
IS GONNA SUDDENLY START
FLYING THROUGH THE AIR.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.736
UH-OH.

03:25.736 --> 03:28.979
I'M GONNA GO TELL
MR. DAVENPORT ABOUT THIS.

03:28.979 --> 03:30.241
WHAT? NO, WAIT!

03:30.241 --> 03:31.642
IF THIS IS A GLITCH,

03:31.642 --> 03:33.584
AND MR. DAVENPORT
FINDS OUT ABOUT IT,

03:33.584 --> 03:35.386
HE WON'T LET ME
GO TO SCHOOL ANYMORE.

03:35.386 --> 03:39.750
LET ME TAP INTO HIS CYBERNET,
SEE IF I CAN FIND OUT ANYTHING.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.824
OKAY...

03:47.698 --> 03:49.560
OOH.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.302
WHOA.

03:51.302 --> 03:53.604
GUYS, THIS ISN'T A GLITCH.

03:53.604 --> 03:57.768
I CAN MOVE OBJECTS
BY MANIPULATING THE ENERGY
AROUND THEM.

03:57.768 --> 04:01.872
I'VE UNLOCKED
A HIDDEN BIONIC ABILITY
CALLED MOLECULAR KINESIS.

04:01.872 --> 04:07.318
CHASE, I'M ALSO GONNA NEED YOU
TO UNLOCK YOUR ABILITY
TO USE SMALLER WORDS.

04:07.318 --> 04:09.920
ACCORDING TO THIS,
WE ALL HAVE HIDDEN ABILITIES.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.822
WHAT?!
 WHAT ARE THEY?

04:11.822 --> 04:13.554
I DON'T KNOW, LET ME SEE.

04:13.554 --> 04:16.327
OH, NO. IT'S SHUTTING US OUT.

04:16.327 --> 04:20.029
MR. DAVENPORT MUST HAVE PUT
A SECURITY LOCK ON IT.

04:20.029 --> 04:21.531
I'M SORRY, GUYS,

04:21.531 --> 04:24.365
I GUESS WE'LL JUST HAVE TO
DISCOVER THEM ON OUR OWN.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.866
FINE.
 OOH!

04:25.866 --> 04:28.899
MAYBE MY NEW ABILITY
IS THAT I CAN SPEAK RUSSIAN.

04:28.899 --> 04:31.672
TESTING, TESTING...

04:31.672 --> 04:33.374
IS THIS RUSSIAN?

04:35.306 --> 04:37.348
KEEP LOOKIN'.

04:40.351 --> 04:41.812
HEY, MR. DAVENPORT.

04:41.812 --> 04:44.355
IS IT OKAY IF MARCUS
SPENDS THE WEEKEND HERE?

04:44.355 --> 04:47.388
HIS DAD IS AWAY
AND HE DOESN'T WANT TO SPEND IT
WITH HIS NOT-DEAD GRANDMA.

04:49.820 --> 04:53.293
NO. DON'T DO IT.
MARCUS IS AN EVIL,
TWO-FACED LIAR.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.327
AND ALSO...A SAGITTARIUS.

04:56.327 --> 04:58.399
THEY'RE SHIFTY.

04:58.399 --> 05:00.931
I AM A SAGITTARIUS.

05:00.931 --> 05:03.474
I REST MY CASE.
 ( doorbell rings )

05:03.474 --> 05:06.306
YOU KNOW, GUYS, THIS IS
REALLY NOT A GREAT WEEKEND...

05:06.306 --> 05:08.739
...FOR VISITORS.
I GOT A LOT OF STUFF...
 MARCUS.

05:08.739 --> 05:10.511
WHAT A SURPRISE.

05:12.413 --> 05:13.814
WE WERE JUST
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

05:15.386 --> 05:17.087
YEAH, LET ME
CATCH YOU UP TO SPEED.

05:17.087 --> 05:20.090
YOU'RE TWO-FACED
AND NO ONE LIKES YOU.
GOODBYE.

05:22.353 --> 05:26.527
I LOVE THIS LITTLE GUY.
HE'S SO FULL OF FIRE!

05:26.527 --> 05:30.330
MR. DAVENPORT, MY DAD LEFT
BEFORE MY GRANDMA GOT THERE

05:30.330 --> 05:31.832
AND I WAS ALL ALONE

05:31.832 --> 05:35.606
AND THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE
THAT I FEEL SAFE AND...

05:35.606 --> 05:37.468
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME LEAVE!

05:40.411 --> 05:42.573
YEAH, OKAY, OKAY.
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

05:42.573 --> 05:44.645
YOU CAN STAY.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.046
( beeping )
 OH.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.479
WHAT IS THAT?
 UH, THAT?

05:48.479 --> 05:50.681
THAT MEANS IT'S, UH--
IT'S HAPPY TIME.

05:50.681 --> 05:53.083
HOW ABOUT YOU STAY HERE
AND BE HAPPY,

05:53.083 --> 05:55.526
AND WE'LL BE HAPPY OVER THERE.

05:55.526 --> 05:57.127
GUYS, THAT IS THE MISSION ALARM.

05:57.127 --> 05:58.959
WE HAVE TO GET DOWN
TO THE LAB IMMEDIATELY.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.361
LEO, DISTRACT MARCUS.
 WHAT?!

06:01.361 --> 06:03.494
NO-- NO. NO.

06:03.494 --> 06:05.536
UH, MARCUS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

06:05.536 --> 06:08.499
WE GOTTA GO...
PICK UP A PIZZA.

06:08.499 --> 06:12.473
ALL OF YOU?
 IT'S AN...EXTRA-LARGE.

06:18.549 --> 06:19.510
OKAY.

06:19.510 --> 06:23.013
SO THEY'RE BUSY,
I HATE YOU, AND YOU HATE ME.

06:23.013 --> 06:26.687
SO WHY DON'T WE
KILL SOME TIME

06:26.687 --> 06:31.692
AND BRUSH UP ON
THE LATEST ISSUE OF...

06:31.692 --> 06:34.394
LADIES LIFE MONTHLY.

06:37.468 --> 06:40.571
( alarm blaring )
 THERE'S A CRISIS
AT MY SPACE STATION.

06:40.571 --> 06:42.973
YOU HAVE A SPACE STATION?
 YEAH.

06:42.973 --> 06:45.536
I'M BUILDING THE WORLD'S
FIRST INTERGALACTIC

06:45.536 --> 06:47.037
TOURIST DESTINATION.

06:47.037 --> 06:50.410
KEY WORDS: "FIRST"
AND "TOURIST." KA-CHING!

06:50.410 --> 06:53.083
WATCH THE EARTH RISE
FROM YOUR HOTEL ROOM

06:53.083 --> 06:54.785
AS YOU ENJOY
ALL THE COMFORT OF HOME,

06:54.785 --> 06:58.048
LIKE OXYGEN AND GRAVITY.

06:58.048 --> 07:00.551
MAN, I HAVE ALWAYS
WANTED TO GO TO SPACE.

07:00.551 --> 07:02.593
YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE
ABOUT TO GET YOUR WISH.

07:02.593 --> 07:04.455
A METEOR SHOWER
STRUCK THE STATION,

07:04.455 --> 07:06.557
AND AN ASTEROID
BREACHED THE HULL.

07:06.557 --> 07:08.529
IT'S GASSING OUT.
IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING QUICK,

07:08.529 --> 07:10.461
IT'S GONNA RE-ENTER
THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE
AND DISINTEGRATE

07:10.461 --> 07:12.463
WITH ALL MY CREW MEMBERS
ONBOARD.

07:12.463 --> 07:15.766
OH! OUR FIRST RESCUE MISSION--
IN SPACE!

07:15.766 --> 07:18.569
WAIT. FROM NOW ON,
I'M GONNA NEED YOU ALL
TO REFER TO ME

07:18.569 --> 07:21.472
BY MY CODE NAME "SPACE CADET."

07:23.574 --> 07:25.215
GOT NEWS FOR YOU, BUDDY.

07:25.215 --> 07:28.479
WE'VE BEEN CALLING YOU
BY YOUR CODE NAME FOR YEARS.

07:28.479 --> 07:31.522
OKAY, YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE
MUCH TRAINING FOR SPACE,

07:31.522 --> 07:33.453
BUT PEOPLE'S LIVES
ARE IN DANGER,

07:33.453 --> 07:35.025
SO I WILL TALK YOU
THROUGH IT.

07:35.025 --> 07:37.688
CHASE, AS USUAL,
YOU ARE OUR MISSION LEADER.

07:37.688 --> 07:41.031
NOW, YOUR MISSION SUITS ARE NOT
EQUIPPED FOR ZERO GRAVITY,

07:41.031 --> 07:43.494
SO THERE ARE THREE SPACE SUITS
IN THE SHUTTLE.

07:43.494 --> 07:46.567
LIFT-OFF IS IN TEN MINUTES.
 WHAT ABOUT MARCUS?

07:46.567 --> 07:49.970
I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS
I'M GONNA HAVE TO CALL
HIS NOT-DEAD GRANDMOTHER.

07:52.042 --> 07:54.074
CHASE, IF YOU'RE GONNA
LEAD THIS MISSION,

07:54.074 --> 07:56.647
YOU HAVE TO TELL DAVENPORT
ABOUT YOUR MOLECULAR KINESIS.

07:56.647 --> 07:59.550
IF YOU CAN'T CONTROL IT,
YOU'RE PUTTING US ALL AT RISK.

07:59.550 --> 08:02.553
DON'T WORRY, OKAY?
I ALREADY TALKED
TO HIM ABOUT IT,

08:02.553 --> 08:03.954
AND HE DEACTIVATED IT.

08:03.954 --> 08:06.717
SO I'M GOOD TO BE
YOUR MISSION LEADER--
AS ALWAYS.

08:06.717 --> 08:09.620
(mocking)
 "I'M YOUR MISSION LEADER."

08:09.620 --> 08:12.492
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
PUT IT ON A T-SHIRT

08:12.492 --> 08:14.725
SO EVERYONE KNOWS
WHEN YOU WALK INTO A ROOM?

08:15.896 --> 08:17.227
I DID.

08:19.670 --> 08:23.103
FINE.
WHEN THE MARTIANS SHOW UP,
YOU'RE GETTIN' PROBED FIRST.

08:27.177 --> 08:30.741
OKAY. SO, WHEN YOU ARE ON
A ROMANTIC CANDLELIGHT DINNER,

08:30.741 --> 08:34.514
DO YOU PREFER DESSERT TO BE
A) A RELAXING FOOT RUB,

08:34.514 --> 08:38.087
B) A NIGHT AWAY FROM THE KIDS,
OR C) CHOCOLATE MOUSSE?

08:38.087 --> 08:42.852
HOW ABOUT D)
FINDING CLEVER NEW WAYS
TO RUIN YOUR LIFE?

08:45.896 --> 08:49.099
HEY, MARCUS. EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE TO BORROW LEO
FOR A SECOND.

08:49.099 --> 08:52.102
SOMETHING WENT HORRIBLY WRONG
WITH THE PIZZA. EXCUSE ME.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.237
HOW'S IT GOING?
 OH, FINE.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.840
I'M DISTRACTING HIM WITH
MY MOM'S LADY MAGAZINES.

08:59.840 --> 09:03.644
TURNS OUT THE CHICAS
 ACTUALLY PREFER A MAN
WITH INSECURITIES.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.676
WHO KNEW?

09:05.676 --> 09:07.547
LOOK, THIS MISSION
IS VERY COMPLICATED.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.881
I HAD TO SEND
ADAM, BREE AND CHASE
INTO SPACE.

09:10.881 --> 09:13.584
THEY'RE IN SPACE?!

09:13.584 --> 09:16.126
AND I'M STUCK HERE
MAKING SMALL TALK

09:16.126 --> 09:18.228
WITH A NARCISSISTIC
COMMITMENT-PHOBE

09:18.228 --> 09:21.131
WHO NINE OUT OF TEN WOMEN
WOULDN'T TAKE HOME
TO MEET THEIR MOTHER?

09:22.793 --> 09:25.736
I EXPECT COMBAT PAY
FOR THIS.

09:30.671 --> 09:33.704
WHERE'D HE GO?
 HE'S PROBABLY UP
ON THE SECOND FLOOR

09:33.704 --> 09:36.647
DANGLING MY HAMSTER
OUT OF THE WINDOW.

09:36.647 --> 09:39.680
JUST FIND HIM
AND GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.682
AHEM!

09:44.955 --> 09:47.818
FINE. COMBAT PAY.

09:47.818 --> 09:50.320
THANK YOU.
BUT JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR,

09:50.320 --> 09:53.624
THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE
MY GAS, MILEAGE, MEALS--

09:53.624 --> 09:55.766
JUST GO!!!

10:00.671 --> 10:02.602
HEY, MR. DAVENPORT!
 HEY, MARCUS.

10:02.602 --> 10:03.934
MARCUS!!!

10:05.275 --> 10:07.908
I COULDN'T FIND MARCUS ANY--
OH, BOY.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.789
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

10:18.789 --> 10:20.220
WHAT ARE THESE?

10:20.220 --> 10:23.153
UH, THOSE--
THOSE ARE...

10:23.153 --> 10:25.055
LEO, TELL HIM
WHAT THOSE ARE.

10:25.055 --> 10:26.997
OH. UM, THEY ARE...

10:26.997 --> 10:28.999
WASHING MACHINES.
 YES!

10:28.999 --> 10:32.703
THESE ARE MY NEW
HIGH-TECH INDUSTRIAL
WASHING MACHINES.

10:32.703 --> 10:35.065
EACH LOAD COSTS
150 QUARTERS.

10:35.065 --> 10:39.069
OKAY, BACK UPSTAIRS,
YOU LITTLE WEIRDO.

10:39.069 --> 10:41.071
BUT I WANT TO WATCH YOU WORK.

10:41.071 --> 10:42.642
NO!
 NO!

10:42.642 --> 10:44.214
UM, ACTUALLY,
YOU KNOW WHAT,

10:44.214 --> 10:46.076
MAYBE SOME OTHER TIME.

10:46.076 --> 10:49.920
BUT LEO, I WILL BE BACK
BEFORE THE RINSE CYCLE

10:49.920 --> 10:53.223
HAS ENOUGH SPACE TO LAND.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.326
GOT IT. OKAY.

10:56.326 --> 10:59.059
UNTIL YOU'RE BACK,
I WILL MAKE IT MY MISSION

10:59.059 --> 11:01.932
TO CONTROL THE RINSE CYCLE.

11:01.932 --> 11:06.036
BUT I THINK THE RINSE CYCLE
MIGHT NEED MORE...

11:06.036 --> 11:07.868
OF A PAYLOAD.

11:17.247 --> 11:19.449
GREETINGS, SPACE PEOPLE!

11:19.449 --> 11:22.883
WE COME IN PEACE
FROM A PLANET CALLED EARTH.

11:24.254 --> 11:26.356
ADAM, THEY'RE
FROM EARTH TOO.
 NO, NO.

11:26.356 --> 11:28.058
THAT'S WHAT THEY
WANT YOU TO THINK.

11:28.058 --> 11:29.019
BUT YOU SEE HER
OVER THERE?

11:29.019 --> 11:30.420
SHE'S ABOUT TO
PULL HER HEAD OFF

11:30.420 --> 11:33.463
AND BECOME QUEEN OF
THE ALIEN SQUID PEOPLE.

11:33.463 --> 11:36.126
WAIT FOR IT,
WAIT FOR IT...

11:39.199 --> 11:41.071
WAIT FOR IT...

11:42.272 --> 11:44.905
HELLO, EVERYONE.
SORRY WE'RE LATE.

11:44.905 --> 11:48.208
THE MILKY WAY IS A BEAR
THIS TIME OF NIGHT.

11:49.940 --> 11:52.112
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE,
YOU'RE SAFE NOW,

11:52.112 --> 11:54.114
SO SINGLE FILE TO
THE BACK OF THE SHUTTLE.

11:54.114 --> 11:58.388
OH, AND YOUR IN-FLIGHT MOVIE
IS ME TALKING ABOUT
MY BOY PROBLEMS. WHOO!

12:06.957 --> 12:09.299
WAIT FOR IT...

12:12.933 --> 12:14.734
UH-UH-UH-UH. OKAY.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.037
I'M ONLY GONNA HAVE TIME
TO COME TO A ROLLING STOP,

12:17.037 --> 12:19.009
SO WHEN WE GET TO YOUR HOUSE,

12:19.009 --> 12:20.841
AIM FOR GRASS.

12:22.913 --> 12:24.314
M-MR. DAVENPORT,

12:24.314 --> 12:26.046
I'M SORRY IT I DID
ANYTHING WRONG,

12:26.046 --> 12:28.979
IT'S JUST YOU'VE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH I LOOK UP TO YOU.

12:28.979 --> 12:31.421
MY DREAM IS TO SOMEDAY
FOLLOW IN YOUR FOOTSTEPS

12:31.421 --> 12:35.155
AND MAYBE, JUST MAYBE,
GET A SLIVER OF YOUR SUCCESS.

12:35.155 --> 12:39.329
AIMING KIND OF HIGH,
AREN'T YOU THERE, KID?

12:39.329 --> 12:42.232
TELL YOU WHAT.
YOU COME OVER
SOME OTHER TIME,

12:42.232 --> 12:46.296
AND I WILL ENLIGHTEN YOU
WITH A LITTLE LESSON
IN DAVENPORTOLOGY.

12:46.296 --> 12:49.769
COOL! AND MAYBE I COULD SHARE
SOME OF MY OWN THEORIES
WITH YOU.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.973
YEAH, I'M PRETTY SURE
THIS IS GONNA BE
ALL ABOUT ME.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.480
THERE ISN'T MUCH TIME.

13:00.480 --> 13:04.184
THE HULL BREACH IS COMPROMISING
THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY
OF THE STATION.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.817
AND THERE'S AN ASTEROID SHOWER
HEADING OUR WAY!

13:06.817 --> 13:09.419
OKAY, I'VE GOT THE TOOL WE NEED
TO FIX THE HULL.

13:09.419 --> 13:11.992
ADAM, BE CAREFUL WITH THAT.
IT'S NOT A TOY.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.524
NOT UNLESS YOU GIVE IT
ITS OWN VOICE.

13:14.524 --> 13:17.127
(falsetto)
HEY, LOOK AT ME!
I'M A TOY!

13:20.300 --> 13:23.103
OKAY, WE HAVE TO
CONTACT MR. DAVENPORT

13:23.103 --> 13:24.474
SO HE CAN GUIDE US
THROUGH THIS.

13:26.376 --> 13:28.909
EARTH HERE.
COMMANDER DOOLEY SPEAKING.

13:28.909 --> 13:31.181
LEO?! WHERE IS
MR. DAVENPORT?

13:31.181 --> 13:34.184
HE HAD TO TAKE MARCUS HOME.
BUT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
BACK BY NOW.

13:34.184 --> 13:36.086
OH, ALSO, BEFORE I FORGET,

13:36.086 --> 13:38.488
I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO BRING ME BACK
A LOT OF SOUVENIRS.

13:38.488 --> 13:40.520
A SPACE HELMET, SPACE ROCKS,

13:40.520 --> 13:42.953
SPACE SOAP, A SPACE TOWEL,

13:42.953 --> 13:44.424
THOSE TINY LITTLE
SPACE SHAMPOOS--

13:44.424 --> 13:46.226
SHAMPOOS, NOT CONDITIONERS--

13:47.827 --> 13:49.399
HOW IS ADAM SUPPOSED
TO GO OUT INTO SPACE

13:49.399 --> 13:51.161
AND FIX THE BREACHED HULL

13:51.161 --> 13:53.403
IF WE DON'T HAVE
MR. DAVENPORT HERE
TO TELL HIM HOW TO DO IT!

13:53.403 --> 13:55.235
( clatter )

13:57.868 --> 13:59.970
CHASE...

13:59.970 --> 14:03.573
DID YOUR DEACTIVATED
MOLECULAR KINESIS

14:03.573 --> 14:06.316
JUST DESTROY THE TOOL WE NEED
TO FIX THE DAMAGED HULL?

14:06.316 --> 14:08.448
NO.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.180
YOU LIED TO US!

14:10.180 --> 14:13.123
YOU NEVER EVEN TOLD DAVENPORT
ABOUT IT, DID YOU?

14:13.123 --> 14:16.126
IF I HAD TOLD HIM ABOUT IT,
HE NEVER WOULD HAVE LET ME
COME INTO SPACE.

14:16.126 --> 14:20.260
WAIT. SO OUR MISSION LEADER
JUST MESSED UP THE MISSION.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.362
WHOO-HOO! FOR ONCE
IT WASN'T ME!

14:24.394 --> 14:27.537
WE HAVE TO TALK
TO MR. DAVENPORT.
HE'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.171
...SPACE CHOCOLATE,
SPACE TAFFY,

14:31.171 --> 14:32.372
A MARTIAN...

14:34.004 --> 14:36.276
MOON CHEESE, SPACE PIZZA...

14:38.108 --> 14:40.050
WELL, DAVENPORT'S NOT THERE,

14:40.050 --> 14:44.054
BUT AT LEAST WE KNOW WHAT
LEO WANTS FROM THE GIFT SHOP!

14:44.054 --> 14:46.416
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?!

14:46.416 --> 14:48.458
WAIT. WHAT IF I USE
MY HEAT VISION

14:48.458 --> 14:50.460
TO SEAL THE PIECES
OF THE HULL BACK TOGETHER?

14:50.460 --> 14:52.522
ADAM! THAT'S A GREAT IDEA!

14:54.264 --> 14:56.666
CHASE,
HAND OVER YOUR T-SHIRT.

14:56.666 --> 14:58.668
UNH-UNH.

14:58.668 --> 15:00.630
LET'S JUST GO.
COME ON. GO.

15:06.306 --> 15:09.209
OKAY, THE VISOR IS DESIGNED
TO LET YOUR HEAT VISION THROUGH.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.540
SO WHATEVER YOU DO,

15:10.540 --> 15:14.214
DON'T OPEN IT
OR YOUR FACE WILL EXPLODE.

15:14.214 --> 15:17.287
ADAM, I'M CONNECTING
THIS TETHER TO YOU.

15:17.287 --> 15:19.349
( laughing )
 IT'LL KEEP YOU CONNECTED
TO THE STATION

15:19.349 --> 15:21.921
SO YOU DON'T DRIFT OFF.
 THAT'S A FUNNY WORD: "TETHER."

15:21.921 --> 15:24.354
TETHER. TETHER. TE-TE--
T-T-T-T- TETHER.

15:24.354 --> 15:26.356
TETHERRRRRR.

15:26.356 --> 15:28.028
TETHER. T-T-T-T-T--

15:28.028 --> 15:29.559
TETHER. TETHER. TETHER.

15:36.336 --> 15:37.567
Adam: TETHER.

15:37.567 --> 15:40.240
TETHER TETHER
TETHER TETHER TETHER.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.072
TETHER. TETHER TETHER TETHER.

15:42.072 --> 15:44.174
ADAM, JUST FIND THE PANEL.

15:45.275 --> 15:47.077
OH, I SEE IT!

16:12.472 --> 16:15.205
I DID IT. I DID IT!

16:15.205 --> 16:17.547
( sizzling )
 UH-OH.

16:17.547 --> 16:19.009
ADAM, WHAT'S WRONG?

16:22.052 --> 16:24.314
OH, NO. HIS HEAT VISION
SEVERED THE TETHER.

16:24.314 --> 16:26.356
HE'S DRIFTING OUT
INTO SPACE!

16:26.356 --> 16:29.289
UH, BREE, WE HAVE
ANOTHER PROBLEM.

16:29.289 --> 16:30.490
ADAM! BEHIND YOU!

16:33.163 --> 16:36.226
( Adam screaming )

16:37.627 --> 16:40.230
JUST USE YOUR SUPER-STRENGTH
TO PUNCH IT APART!

16:43.433 --> 16:44.634
OW!!!

16:49.779 --> 16:51.411
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:51.411 --> 16:54.144
I GOTTA GO SAVE HIM.
THERE'S ANOTHER TETHER.

16:54.144 --> 16:57.547
HELP ME PUT THIS ON.
I CAN FLOAT OUT TO HIM
AND PULL HIM IN.

16:57.547 --> 16:59.119
ALL RIGHT.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.721
LOOK, JUST BE SAFE
OUT THERE, OKAY?

17:05.395 --> 17:07.457
( door closing )

17:11.560 --> 17:14.364
ADAM, HOLD ON.
I'M COMING!

17:14.364 --> 17:16.736
HOLD ON TO WHAT?

17:16.736 --> 17:19.469
I CAN'T REACH!
THE TETHER'S TOO SHORT!

17:19.469 --> 17:22.442
DID YOU BRING A STICK?

17:22.442 --> 17:25.044
IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK!
I'M DRIFTING AWAY!

17:25.044 --> 17:28.218
WAIT! MAYBE I COULD USE
MY MOLECULAR KINESIS

17:28.218 --> 17:29.519
TO BRING HIM CLOSER TO YOU!

17:29.519 --> 17:31.381
CHASE, YOU CAN'T CONTROL IT.

17:31.381 --> 17:33.723
WHAT IF WE GO FLYING OFF
INTO SPACE?

17:33.723 --> 17:36.386
ALREADY DOING IT.
I SAY GO FOR IT.

17:39.489 --> 17:41.261
COME ON!

17:43.763 --> 17:45.365
IT'S NOT WORKING.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.467
MAYBE IT DOESN'T WORK ON PEOPLE.

17:47.467 --> 17:50.400
TRY HARDER!
IT'S OUR LAST HOPE!

17:54.404 --> 17:56.606
A LITTLE MORE...

17:56.606 --> 17:58.348
A LITTLE MORE...

17:58.348 --> 18:00.250
STRETCH!

18:02.152 --> 18:03.353
I GOT HIM!

18:03.353 --> 18:05.385
YES!

18:05.385 --> 18:08.518
WHO'S THE MOLECULAR
KINESIS MASTER!

18:11.591 --> 18:13.363
CHASE!
 CHASE!

18:19.799 --> 18:22.502
ON MY WAY HOME
I DISCOVERED WHAT
THAT LITTLE RED LIGHT

18:22.502 --> 18:24.874
ON MY DASHBOARD
OF MY HYDROGEN CAR MEANS.

18:24.874 --> 18:28.508
IT MEANS
"YOU'RE OUT OF HYDROGEN
AND YOU'RE WALKING HOME."

18:30.410 --> 18:32.282
HOW'S THE MISSION GOING?

18:32.282 --> 18:34.614
GUYS? GUYS? WHAT'S THE STATUS
OF THE SPACE STATION?

18:34.614 --> 18:35.645
ARE YOU THERE?

18:35.645 --> 18:37.817
YUP, RIGHT HERE.

18:37.817 --> 18:40.520
OH. HELLO.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.892
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

18:42.892 --> 18:44.594
YOU TOTALLY
ABANDONED US!

18:44.594 --> 18:46.456
AND THE ENTIRE MISSION!

18:46.456 --> 18:48.198
ADAM FLOATED OUT INTO SPACE

18:48.198 --> 18:50.800
AND ALMOST BECAME
THE WORLD'S DUMBEST SATELLITE.

18:50.800 --> 18:56.406
AND HE WOULD HAVE
IF I HADN'T HAVE STUMBLED ACROSS
MY MOLECULAR KINESIS.

18:56.406 --> 19:02.412
OH...ALSO I STUMBLED UPON
MY MOLECULAR KINESIS.

19:02.412 --> 19:04.674
HOW DID YOU
FIND OUT ABOUT THAT?

19:04.674 --> 19:06.876
I THINK THE MORE
IMPORTANT QUESTION IS

19:06.876 --> 19:09.919
HOW COULD YOU NOT
HAVE TOLD ME SOONER?

19:09.919 --> 19:12.922
UH, MR. DAVENPORT,
WHAT OTHER ABILITIES DO I HAVE?

19:12.922 --> 19:15.625
BECAUSE I VOTE FOR THE ABILITY
TO LOOK INTO THE FUTURE

19:15.625 --> 19:18.558
AND SEE MYSELF FAR, FAR AWAY

19:18.558 --> 19:21.361
FROM ALL OF...THIS.

19:25.265 --> 19:28.498
YES, IT'S--IT'S TRUE,
YOU ALL HAVE ABILITIES
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

19:28.498 --> 19:31.701
BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT THEY ARE
OR WHEN THEY'LL APPEAR.

19:31.701 --> 19:33.643
WHY NOT?

19:33.643 --> 19:37.747
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY ALL ARE
OR WHEN THEY'LL APPEAR.

19:37.747 --> 19:40.510
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU DON'T KNOW?

19:40.510 --> 19:42.882
LOOK, THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS
I CAN'T TELL YOU RIGHT NOW,

19:42.882 --> 19:44.584
BUT IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.956
STRANGE THINGS
WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN,

19:46.956 --> 19:50.520
AND I PROMISE EVENTUALLY
I WILL GIVE YOU THE ANSWERS
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

19:50.520 --> 19:53.493
BUT FOR NOW,
YOU JUST HAVE TO TRUST ME.

19:53.493 --> 19:56.526
BUT MR. DAVENPORT--
 PLEASE, I NEED YOU
TO TRUST ME.

19:56.526 --> 19:59.529
AND YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
WHO YOU ALLOW INTO YOUR LIVES.

19:59.529 --> 20:02.732
WE HAD A CLOSE CALL TODAY.
MARCUS FOUND THE LAB.

20:02.732 --> 20:04.934
WHAT?
 HMM...

20:04.934 --> 20:07.707
WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED
THAT MARCUS COMING HERE

20:07.707 --> 20:10.480
WOULD LEAD TO BAD THINGS?

20:11.611 --> 20:15.485
I'LL TELL YOU.
IT'S MR. TINY McLITTLESTEIN!

20:15.485 --> 20:17.287
RIGHT HERE!

20:17.287 --> 20:19.819
WE'RE JUST LUCKY
I CAME DOWN WHEN I DID,

20:19.819 --> 20:23.253
OR HE COULD HAVE DISCOVERED
ALL OF OUR SECRETS.

20:26.696 --> 20:29.499
EVERYTHING WENT
EXACTLY AS PLANNED.

20:29.499 --> 20:31.761
DAVENPORT'S LAB WAS
RIGHT WHERE YOU SAID
IT WOULD BE,

20:31.761 --> 20:34.664
AND THE MICROSCOPIC SPYCAM
IS UP AND RUNNING.

20:43.012 --> 20:45.875
WE'VE GOT THEM
RIGHT WHERE WE WANT 'EM.

20:53.923 --> 20:55.425
THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING.

20:55.425 --> 20:57.657
I HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT
ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.

20:57.657 --> 21:00.560
I HAVE DISCOVERED
MY HIDDEN ABILITY!

21:00.560 --> 21:02.532
WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

21:02.532 --> 21:04.764
CHECK IT OUT.
( clears throat )

21:06.296 --> 21:09.599
( belching loudly )

21:10.670 --> 21:12.842
SUPER-BURPS!

21:14.444 --> 21:16.576
OKAY, IS THIS
REALLY HAPPENING?

21:16.576 --> 21:19.679
ALL RIGHT, SUPER-BURPS IT IS.

21:21.381 --> 21:24.814
AND HOW DO YOU PLAN ON USING
THIS AMAZING NEW ABILITY?

21:24.814 --> 21:26.916
WATCH AND I'LL SHOW YOU.

21:26.916 --> 21:29.359
HEY, GUYS,
WHAT'S UP?

21:30.790 --> 21:33.763
( belches )

21:35.565 --> 21:38.368
THAT IS NOT BAD.
 YEAH, YOU MIGHT
HAVE SOMETHING THERE.
