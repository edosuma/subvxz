CITY A – HERO ASSOCIATION HQ

00:10.010 --> 00:11.070
Then it is decided that Mumen Rider

00:11.070 --> 00:14.030
will remain the top-ranked class C hero.

00:14.030 --> 00:17.063
Understood. I will let him know.

00:17.063 --> 00:18.099
I simply cannot understand

00:18.099 --> 00:22.021
why he has no desire
to move up to class B...

00:22.021 --> 00:29.025
Our next agenda item is
the 55th Hero Certification Exam.

00:29.025 --> 00:31.059
For this exam,
the total number of candidates is...

00:31.059 --> 00:36.023
11,684, with the exam offered
at six different venues.

00:36.023 --> 00:39.097
That is an increase of more than
22% over the previous exam.

00:41.069 --> 00:44.063
We mustn't be happy
with simple quantity.

00:44.063 --> 00:46.045
Even with more candidates,

00:46.045 --> 00:48.094
if the quality of the heroes
is reduced,

00:48.094 --> 00:51.011
the numbers are meaningless.

00:53.041 --> 00:57.032
Therefore, we ought to be even more
critical during evaluations.

00:57.062 --> 01:00.008
Also, I hear that
a certain person of interest

01:00.008 --> 01:03.054
is taking the exam this time.

01:03.054 --> 01:06.029
Yes, it hasn't been confirmed yet,

01:06.080 --> 01:10.029
but it seems very likely
that he will.

01:39.028 --> 01:40.078

01:40.078 --> 01:44.091

01:44.091 --> 01:48.054

Power, get power

Hero

01:56.055 --> 01:59.071

01:59.071 --> 02:02.076

01:59.071 --> 02:02.076

Hero

02:04.001 --> 02:08.077
dakara hitoshirezu aku to tatakau

02:04.001 --> 02:08.077
So he just fight evil without end

02:08.077 --> 02:10.023
Nobody knows who he is

02:10.023 --> 02:14.040
sora ooi oshiyoseru teki

Side-to-side jumps for 30 seconds!

Next, the 1500-meter run. Go!

03:39.099 --> 03:42.049
Next, weightlifting!

03:44.000 --> 03:46.049
Next, shot put!

03:48.063 --> 03:50.037

Punching machine!

04:04.077 --> 04:06.001
I'm going home...

04:06.001 --> 04:10.052
THE ULTIMATE MASTER

04:14.082 --> 04:17.067
Finally done with all the tests.

04:17.067 --> 04:20.011
Now I just wait for the results.

04:21.053 --> 04:24.032
Oh, you done, too?

04:24.032 --> 04:25.075
Yes.

04:25.075 --> 04:28.074
Hey, is there a point in you
taking fitness tests?

04:28.074 --> 04:29.091
Huh?

04:29.091 --> 04:34.012
I mean, can't you just give them
the data on your specs?

04:34.076 --> 04:37.083
Well, whatever. So how was it?

04:37.083 --> 04:42.006
Both the written and fitness tests
were far too simple.

04:42.006 --> 04:46.088
Right? Is that really all there is
to becoming a hero?

04:46.088 --> 04:48.090
We should get our results soon.

04:48.090 --> 04:51.034
70 points is a passing grade.

04:51.034 --> 04:55.074
The written test was so easy
anyone could get full points on it.

04:55.074 --> 04:58.015
That just leaves the fitness test,

04:58.015 --> 05:00.041
which for us should not have
posed any problems.

05:00.057 --> 05:03.036
— ONE HOUR LATER

05:03.076 --> 05:05.032
I got 100 points.

05:05.032 --> 05:06.053
Seriously?

05:06.053 --> 05:07.090
Yes.

05:09.025 --> 05:12.095
It says I'm certified as
a class S hero.

05:12.095 --> 05:15.041
Class S? What's that?

05:15.041 --> 05:19.009
I am sure these rankings
mean little.

05:19.009 --> 05:20.059
How did you do, Master?

05:20.059 --> 05:22.009
Huh?

05:23.051 --> 05:25.088
Oh! The letter says I'm also...

05:25.088 --> 05:27.023
Class S.

05:27.023 --> 05:29.009
I am not surprised.

05:29.090 --> 05:33.014
On top of that, the font size
is bigger than mine.

05:34.032 --> 05:36.034
I expected nothing less, Master.

05:36.034 --> 05:39.050
By the way, what did they
ask you at the interview?

05:39.050 --> 05:40.078
Interview?

05:40.078 --> 05:42.027
Yes.

05:42.074 --> 05:46.094
Just one final question, Genos.

05:47.058 --> 05:49.091
Does this building
look familiar to you?

05:50.046 --> 05:54.091
We've been secretly investigating
a group of troublemakers

05:54.091 --> 05:57.066
that call themselves
the “House of Evolution.”

05:57.066 --> 06:00.038
Just when we identified
its center of operations,

06:00.038 --> 06:04.021
we found the building had been
mysteriously destroyed.

06:05.006 --> 06:08.013
And with overwhelmingly
intense firepower.

06:10.044 --> 06:13.089
Are you responsible for this?

06:14.023 --> 06:15.057
I am.

06:15.057 --> 06:17.006
Why?

06:21.061 --> 06:24.082
certified S class

06:25.016 --> 06:26.069
I see...

06:26.069 --> 06:27.095
I suppose it must be that

06:27.095 --> 06:31.049
they felt no need to go through
the trouble of interviewing you.

06:33.071 --> 06:35.020
Master?

06:36.071 --> 06:38.046
Yeah, after all...

06:38.046 --> 06:42.096
I'm just a class C hero
with a score of 71 points.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.034
I see.

06:45.076 --> 06:50.051
So I mistakenly thought the top half
of the “C” was part an “S.”

06:50.051 --> 06:52.018
Stop analyzing it!

06:52.018 --> 06:54.015
It must be a mistake.

06:54.015 --> 06:56.014
I will talk to
the person in charge.

06:56.014 --> 06:59.006
No, don't!
You'll just embarrass me!

06:59.082 --> 07:02.026
Mr. Genos, Mr. Saitama,

07:02.026 --> 07:05.054
there will be a seminar for
successful candidates at 4:00 PM.

07:05.054 --> 07:07.048
Please come to lecture hall #3.

07:08.008 --> 07:09.091
All right, come on.

07:09.091 --> 07:13.067
All that really matters
is we passed.

07:13.067 --> 07:16.003
Let's get it over with and go home.

07:18.017 --> 07:21.029
We finally found the cyborg
we've been looking for.

07:21.029 --> 07:23.029
So I've heard.

07:23.063 --> 07:25.059
In consideration of
his past accomplishments,

07:25.059 --> 07:29.009
we made an exception and
certified him as a Class S hero.

07:29.047 --> 07:33.044
I just wanted to make sure
you were notified of this.

07:33.044 --> 07:36.014
Yes, I approve.

07:41.082 --> 07:43.064
Genos, huh?

07:44.027 --> 07:46.027
Lecture Hall 3

07:46.078 --> 07:49.019
First, congratulations on passing.

07:52.066 --> 07:55.079
Now one of you
only made it on a fluke,

07:55.079 --> 07:58.013
so unless you want your luck
to go to waste,

07:58.013 --> 08:00.074
I better see you
giving it your all.

08:01.071 --> 08:03.067
And don't get all puffed up!

08:03.067 --> 08:08.076
From here on, keep your hero status
in mind and act modestly!

08:08.076 --> 08:14.026
After all, your faces will be placed
on the Hero Association website.

08:16.031 --> 08:18.031
Did you hear me?

08:18.031 --> 08:21.069
That goofball head of yours is
gonna be shown to the whole world.

08:21.069 --> 08:24.018
If you don't want to
humiliate yourselves...

08:30.008 --> 08:33.019
Aspire to be a fine hero like me!

08:37.078 --> 08:39.028
Master!

08:41.020 --> 08:45.046
As a class A hero, I have some
influence over the Association.

08:45.046 --> 08:47.068
I'll make sure those who
behave irresponsibly...

08:47.068 --> 08:50.000
lose points and get demoted.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.092
Don't you forget it!

08:52.068 --> 08:54.092
What should I have for dinner?

08:57.010 --> 09:01.039
Apparently, the Hero Association
was formed about three years ago.

09:02.073 --> 09:04.078
So it's only been three years?

09:04.078 --> 09:06.094
It was after the grandchild of
a millionaire called Agoni

09:06.094 --> 09:08.074
was attacked by a monster.

09:08.074 --> 09:11.073
The child was saved by a passerby.

09:11.073 --> 09:13.090
When Agoni heard
what had happened,

09:13.090 --> 09:16.095
he came up with this system
and used his fortune

09:16.095 --> 09:19.053
to establish the Hero Association.

09:19.053 --> 09:22.037
Well, they put on
some pretty boring seminars.

09:22.067 --> 09:28.082
In any case, as new heroes,
we'll be known around the world.

09:28.082 --> 09:32.021
Now we can work with
our heads held high.

09:34.006 --> 09:35.055
Master...

09:38.060 --> 09:41.005
I guess I'm now officially
your disciple.

09:42.036 --> 09:45.083
Please continue to guide me
as my mentor.

09:45.083 --> 09:47.006
Yeah...

09:47.006 --> 09:49.023
All right, Master. Good night.

09:49.023 --> 09:51.090
Yeah, see you.

09:54.066 --> 09:56.012
Crap...

09:56.012 --> 09:59.078
Maybe I shouldn't have been so quick
to say I'd take a disciple.

10:01.013 --> 10:03.021
Especially this guy...

10:03.021 --> 10:07.046
m 50 28 l 522 40 522 210 79 153

10:03.021 --> 10:07.046
OFFICE

10:03.021 --> 10:07.039
Those two newcomers today—
did they really pass the exam?

10:07.039 --> 10:09.033
Their attitudes were awful!

10:09.033 --> 10:14.076
I'm Class A, rank 38 damn it,
and they had no idea who I was.

10:14.076 --> 10:17.035
Plus they don't know the first thing
about how the world works.

10:17.035 --> 10:19.009
Damn amateurs!

10:19.009 --> 10:20.093
They'll be dirt-napping in no time.

10:20.093 --> 10:22.030
No.

10:22.098 --> 10:26.069
Genos got perfect scores on both
the written and physical exams.

10:26.069 --> 10:28.014
He's a phenomenal rookie

10:28.014 --> 10:30.057
who gained a class S ranking
right off the bat.

10:30.057 --> 10:35.003
The other one, Saitama,
had terrible scores on the essay,

10:35.003 --> 10:37.064
but scored a perfect 50
on the physical.

10:37.064 --> 10:40.057
That's how he was able to
pass at all.

10:40.087 --> 10:43.073
But in practically every activity
on the fitness exam,

10:43.073 --> 10:48.054
he broke the Hero Association's test
records by inconceivable margins.

10:51.005 --> 10:55.021
It's as if there's a god
residing in that body.

10:57.006 --> 11:01.094
Snek, you've already been
outranked by Genos.

11:01.094 --> 11:05.080
And Saitama may catch up
with you soon enough.

11:08.040 --> 11:10.014
That jackass?

11:11.078 --> 11:16.046
If I get to the top of class C,
then I'll get promoted to class B...

11:16.046 --> 11:21.065
And class A is above that,
with class S even above that...

11:22.083 --> 11:25.082
I guess Genos is
actually pretty amazing.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.016
I don't know...

11:30.084 --> 11:34.033
...but maybe this isn't
the kind of hero I wanted to be.

11:37.043 --> 11:40.043
The newcomer seminar
isn't over yet!

11:40.043 --> 11:43.093
In this business, there's a thing
called rookie crushing.

11:43.093 --> 11:47.090
A lot of us heroes
hate to be outranked.

11:47.090 --> 11:52.023
So we crush newbies early on...
like this!

12:27.094 --> 12:29.076
Hero Registry?

12:29.076 --> 12:34.090
Yes, I am a class S hero and you
are a class C hero.

12:34.090 --> 12:37.025
We are both ranked last
in our classes.

12:37.025 --> 12:41.048
Right now, we are still listed
as Genos and Saitama,

12:41.095 --> 12:45.053
but as we perform more heroic acts,
we will acquire hero names.

12:45.083 --> 12:48.051
Hero names? What are those?

12:48.051 --> 12:53.090
I believe they are like nicknames
that capture a hero's characteristics.

12:53.090 --> 12:56.067
For example,
I might be the “Blond Cyborg.”

12:56.067 --> 13:01.034
Wait, if that's how it works,
won't I be like the “Caped Baldy?”

13:02.014 --> 13:04.009
Aside from being ranked by ability,

13:04.009 --> 13:06.079
you can also be
ranked by popularity.

13:06.079 --> 13:09.001
There are some heroes
that have fan clubs.

13:09.056 --> 13:12.010
Well, no one cares about that.

13:13.015 --> 13:17.078
Thank you for agreeing to
my unreasonable request today.

13:17.078 --> 13:22.027
Yeah, well I did promise
to make you my disciple...

13:22.074 --> 13:24.055
Is right here good?

13:24.055 --> 13:25.040
Yes...

13:26.016 --> 13:28.011
So we're just having
a practice bout, right?

13:28.011 --> 13:29.049
Not fighting for real?

13:29.092 --> 13:31.062
Yes, that's what I have in mind.

13:32.013 --> 13:37.025
But I want you to go all out,
so I too will give it my all.

13:43.076 --> 13:45.038
Please grant my request.

14:21.013 --> 14:22.018
That was close...

14:22.018 --> 14:24.084
My clothes could have got
burnt up again.

14:30.081 --> 14:32.055
I need more speed!

14:55.079 --> 14:57.025
He's gone?

14:57.025 --> 15:00.016
Have I been chasing
his afterimage this whole time?

15:05.093 --> 15:07.034
There!

15:13.098 --> 15:15.022
Incinerate!

15:17.065 --> 15:19.027
I got him this time.

15:19.027 --> 15:21.078
Master will have to take me
more seriously now...

15:21.078 --> 15:23.035
Behind—

15:23.091 --> 15:25.036
Okay, I win.

15:30.025 --> 15:31.020
Master...

15:31.020 --> 15:32.036
Yah?

15:32.036 --> 15:35.041
Have you forgotten
the rules of the bout?

15:35.096 --> 15:39.057
Dodge any attack
you are able to dodge.

15:39.057 --> 15:41.096
Take it seriously
and no fooling around.

15:41.096 --> 15:43.096
Do not hold back.

15:43.096 --> 15:45.017
And...

15:45.076 --> 15:49.038
keep fighting until
I am no longer able to fight.

15:50.047 --> 15:53.001
Even Master Saitama himself
cannot explain.

15:53.001 --> 15:55.097
The secret to his power...

15:56.077 --> 15:59.076
This fight may give me
some insight into it.

16:00.073 --> 16:02.064
Show me no mercy.

16:07.024 --> 16:09.028
Those were the rules, Master—

16:13.000 --> 16:14.008
What the—?!

16:14.016 --> 16:15.066
DEATH

16:27.064 --> 16:30.039
I'm starving. Time for lunch.

16:30.039 --> 16:32.021
Let's grab some udon noodles.

16:35.006 --> 16:36.051
Okay...

16:39.015 --> 16:43.035
I am prepared to do anything
in order to become stronger.

16:43.086 --> 16:44.093
But...

16:45.074 --> 16:48.086
I can't picture myself
even approaching Master's power.

16:50.087 --> 16:52.040
Not at all...

16:57.046 --> 16:58.099
He's on a different level.

17:01.017 --> 17:04.003
What's the matter?
You don't like udon?

17:07.063 --> 17:12.034
I see, that's his location?
Thanks, I'll head there now.

17:13.047 --> 17:15.080
No, don't worry.

17:15.080 --> 17:19.013
I'm just going to let him know
what the industry expects of him.

17:21.069 --> 17:23.098
I'm glad you like udon.

17:23.098 --> 17:27.002
Yes, I'm not very picky.

17:27.002 --> 17:30.052
Well, I'm also kinda
low on funds right now...

17:31.049 --> 17:34.015
Hey, how about
another match, Genos?

17:35.020 --> 17:39.087
SUPER-SPICY MEGA-MONSTER UDON CHALLENGE
PRIZE: ¥50,000, FAILURE: ¥10,000

17:40.039 --> 17:41.091
That's insane!

17:41.091 --> 17:43.028
No way!

17:47.013 --> 17:48.037
I give up...

17:53.089 --> 17:55.034
Is that it?

17:57.048 --> 17:59.026
Man, you're awesome!

18:01.073 --> 18:03.018
Welcome?!

18:07.074 --> 18:09.044
You must be Genos.

18:10.082 --> 18:13.027
I'm Amai Mask, class A rank 1.

18:13.070 --> 18:15.036
I'd like to talk to you.

18:15.079 --> 18:17.086
Class A, rank 1?

18:17.086 --> 18:18.099
It's Amai Mask!

18:18.099 --> 18:20.082
He's so gorgeous!

18:21.063 --> 18:22.087
Talk?

18:23.038 --> 18:25.062
He might be a rookie crusher...

18:25.062 --> 18:27.050
Be careful, Genos!

18:27.050 --> 18:31.033
I see. Please wait here, Master.

18:31.097 --> 18:33.017
Very well.

18:33.017 --> 18:36.030
I was just thinking about taking
a walk to digest my food.

18:41.077 --> 18:44.052
I hear you were certified class S
by special exception.

18:44.052 --> 18:45.097
What of it?

18:52.003 --> 18:54.036
I wonder if he's all right...

19:03.092 --> 19:05.066
Done already?

19:05.066 --> 19:06.062
Yes.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.065
You really are class S.

19:08.065 --> 19:12.000
To have the top-ranked class A hero
come to personally crush you...

19:12.000 --> 19:13.008
That's not it.

19:13.097 --> 19:17.095
So he wasn't here to fight?
Then what gives?

19:17.095 --> 19:19.046
In short...

19:20.014 --> 19:21.076
He came to welcome me.

19:22.019 --> 19:25.041
Huh? What's that mean?

19:25.041 --> 19:26.081
Excuse me!

19:26.081 --> 19:29.089
You're friends with
Amai Mask, right?

19:29.089 --> 19:31.077
May I shake your hand?

19:34.057 --> 19:35.094
Thank you very much!

19:35.094 --> 19:37.023
Shake mine too!

19:41.096 --> 19:46.032
Class S and class C heroes
sure get treated differently.

19:46.067 --> 19:49.041
If you think about it, though,
isn't that like fraud money?

19:49.041 --> 19:52.042
WELCOME GIFT

19:49.091 --> 19:51.083
I mean, you're a cyborg, right?

19:51.083 --> 19:52.084
Yes...

19:52.084 --> 19:57.050
Never mind. In any case, now we're
even with a win and a loss apiece.

19:57.093 --> 20:01.018
Starting today
we're professional heroes.

20:01.018 --> 20:03.049
Let's do our best, okay?

20:03.049 --> 20:04.051
Yes.

20:06.073 --> 20:12.043
A professional hero must always be
a beautiful symbol of justice.

20:13.003 --> 20:15.048
That is my philosophy.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.061
It's especially true
if you're a class S hero.

20:19.028 --> 20:22.043
Come on,
there's no need to glare at me.

20:22.043 --> 20:25.032
I came all the way here
just to see you.

20:26.029 --> 20:28.012
How was the Certification Exam?

20:28.012 --> 20:32.004
It was nothing but rubbish.
An exam like that is a waste of time.

20:34.051 --> 20:38.071
If you came to fight, get on with it.
This, too, is a waste of time.

20:41.014 --> 20:45.047
Being hot-blooded is fine,
but if you take it too far...

20:46.044 --> 20:47.097
...you'll get burnt.

20:51.036 --> 20:54.084
I'll forget your criticism
of the Association.

20:54.084 --> 20:56.060
Thank you for your time.

20:57.003 --> 20:59.011
I welcome you to the team.

20:59.082 --> 21:01.023
We expect great things
from you...

21:01.083 --> 21:03.044
Genos.

21:15.080 --> 21:16.075
Master...

21:20.039 --> 21:22.046
I will be back later.

21:24.002 --> 21:26.005
Oh, okay...

21:26.005 --> 21:27.051
I'll see you.

21:27.081 --> 21:30.022
Yes, goodbye.

21:57.088 --> 22:00.017
A waste of time?

22:01.089 --> 22:04.042

Uh...

23:40.028 --> 23:42.023
So when you said,
“I'll be back...”

23:42.023 --> 23:44.010
This is what you meant?

23:44.010 --> 23:47.078
Yes. I went home
to gather my things.

23:49.036 --> 23:51.028
May I live here?

23:52.016 --> 23:53.074
Absolutely not.

23:54.075 --> 23:56.024
I have rent money.

24:00.059 --> 24:02.051
Did you bring a toothbrush?

24:02.051 --> 24:03.071
Yes!

NEXT EPISODE

24:05.004 --> 24:25.002
THE TERRIFYING CITY

24:05.066 --> 24:08.048
I am Snek, 
Class A, rank 38!

24:08.048 --> 24:12.005
A lot of guys think
my name is “Snake,”

24:12.005 --> 24:13.059
but it's Snek, 
so don't forget it!

24:13.059 --> 24:16.068
Next on One-Punch Man
is episode 6, 
The Terrifying City

24:16.068 --> 24:20.035
There's time left?
Well, I'm fully 
aware of that.

24:20.035 --> 24:21.085
That's right! 
In this industry,

24:21.085 --> 24:24.069
there's such a thing 
as killing time with 
episode previews!
