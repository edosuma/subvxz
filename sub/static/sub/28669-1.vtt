00:18.028 --> 00:21.496
The battle was all but over.

00:21.498 --> 00:23.631
The forces of good, the living

00:23.633 --> 00:26.767
had fallen by the thousands.

00:26.769 --> 00:30.904
The risen dead
swept over them in a vile,

00:30.906 --> 00:35.942
and cankerous wave
that knew not when to break.

00:35.944 --> 00:39.379
But as long as
their fearless leader,

00:39.381 --> 00:42.815
the mighty
Casimir the Destroyer,

00:42.817 --> 00:47.486
battle mage, warrior,
and renowned tactician

00:47.488 --> 00:50.122
still drew breath,

00:50.124 --> 00:53.926
there was yet some hope.

00:53.928 --> 00:58.562
And as the horde
of hell's spawn dead,

00:58.564 --> 01:01.866
raised by the evil necromancer.

01:01.868 --> 01:05.937
Morana, grew
closer, unwittingly lured

01:05.939 --> 01:07.972
into a fatal pincer movement,

01:07.974 --> 01:12.910
through the otherwise impassable
sulphur swamps of Sagra,

01:12.912 --> 01:17.915
Casimir knew he had
them in the palm of his hand.

01:17.917 --> 01:20.650
Knew that a historic victory

01:20.652 --> 01:24.154
was but a single blow away.

01:24.156 --> 01:26.923
There was no
escaping the fury

01:26.925 --> 01:30.559
of Casimir's blazing damnation.

01:30.561 --> 01:35.164
The magically conjured
flames burned hard and fast

01:35.166 --> 01:38.869
devouring the
undead in a matter of seconds.

01:40.704 --> 01:44.171
And for the first
of many times to come,

01:44.173 --> 01:47.708
Casimir looked down triumphant

01:47.710 --> 01:50.010
upon the carnage he had wrought.

01:50.012 --> 01:54.181
Upon the victory he had
single-handedly wretched

01:54.183 --> 01:59.086
from the rotten jaws
of almost certain defeat.

02:33.952 --> 02:38.088
Casimir would not rest
until his nemesis Morana had fallen.

02:40.926 --> 02:44.928
Along with her scurrilous lapdog
of a so-called swordsman,

02:44.930 --> 02:46.932
Sir Brandt.

02:50.735 --> 02:52.436
Fuck sake.

02:53.938 --> 02:56.605
Oh! Mr. Parsons.

02:56.607 --> 02:59.742
Afternoon. Trevor isn't it?

02:59.744 --> 03:01.612
Last time I checked!

03:03.047 --> 03:05.246
Right. I've been
meaning to have a word.

03:05.248 --> 03:07.951
See the thing is
that some of us here.

03:11.487 --> 03:12.488
Sorry!

03:14.157 --> 03:18.259
Fundamentally,
some of us here.

03:18.261 --> 03:21.261
W-we take pride.

03:21.263 --> 03:23.797
I'm not sure how to-

03:23.799 --> 03:25.866
your plot's a disgrace.

03:28.803 --> 03:30.670
Well, it's a little
on the barren side but

03:30.672 --> 03:32.605
it's got some
post-apocalyptic charm.

03:32.607 --> 03:33.739
Clearly.

03:33.741 --> 03:36.008
Disgrace is a very strong word.

03:36.010 --> 03:39.911
But it's
accurate. Look around you.

03:39.913 --> 03:43.915
Do you see anything out of
place in my plot? No, nothing.

03:43.917 --> 03:44.983
It's beauty.

03:44.985 --> 03:48.687
Ted and Irene may be
slow, but they're methodical.

03:48.689 --> 03:50.822
Even Birch keeps his end up.

03:50.824 --> 03:53.624
Peter, almost as
annoying as you are,

03:53.626 --> 03:55.859
but at least he
knows what he's doing.

03:55.861 --> 03:58.762
And Doc doesn't do
anything at all, but he's tidy.

03:58.764 --> 04:00.731
Now you, on the other hand,

04:00.733 --> 04:03.300
you are more than
letting the side down.

04:03.302 --> 04:05.636
To be honest
gardening isn't really my thing.

04:05.638 --> 04:08.237
Jesus Christ! Why do
you have an allotment then?

04:08.239 --> 04:11.007
Why do you come here
and spoil it for the rest of us?

04:11.009 --> 04:12.675
I'd be willing
to put up a fence.

04:12.677 --> 04:15.680
Look, we've gotten
together and signed a petition.

04:17.716 --> 04:20.750
We're giving it to the
landlord tomorrow morning.

04:20.752 --> 04:24.953
And I sincerely hope
he decides to evict you,

04:24.955 --> 04:26.687
and your terrible
hair-do. Good day!

04:26.689 --> 04:29.557
What? No! No, no,
no, no, no, no! I'll tidy up.

04:29.559 --> 04:33.063
I'll, I'll plant some seeds!
I'll, I'll, plant the crap fu...

04:35.933 --> 04:36.934
God.

04:48.610 --> 04:49.611
Oh!

05:01.922 --> 05:03.257
Oooh!

05:10.598 --> 05:12.330
Woo!

06:13.155 --> 06:15.222
Harriet, why don't you
come round to mine after work?

06:15.224 --> 06:16.956
I've got some pear vodka.

06:16.958 --> 06:18.791
Oh, yes, please!

06:18.793 --> 06:21.327
Funny innit like, us
sitting here doing nothing,

06:21.329 --> 06:24.964
makes you more tired
than when you're busy, eh?

06:24.966 --> 06:26.899
You're not wrong Bobbi.

06:26.901 --> 06:30.002
It's a bit like
shagging, if you think about it.

06:30.004 --> 06:32.304
The more you do
it, the more you want it.

06:32.306 --> 06:35.309
It only makes you more
horny. It's really annoying.

06:36.410 --> 06:38.178
I wouldn't know.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.679
When are you going to be done?

06:41.681 --> 06:45.817
Oh, it's just my Derek
now. A little quick half hour.

06:45.819 --> 06:49.019
But I'll do him
quick today, yeah?

06:51.023 --> 06:53.424
There she blows.

06:53.426 --> 06:55.128
Hi darling!

06:56.895 --> 07:01.332
Aww, I love presents. Thank you.

07:01.334 --> 07:03.300
Do you want a little shower?

07:03.302 --> 07:07.069
- I'm clean as a whistle.
- Mmm.

07:07.071 --> 07:10.373
Well, I'll have to
blow you to find out won't I?

07:10.375 --> 07:11.376
Yes!

07:14.178 --> 07:15.179
Hmm.

07:20.317 --> 07:21.851
Trevor?

07:24.421 --> 07:25.422
Doc!

07:27.056 --> 07:29.959
I didn t sign the
petition by the way.

07:31.895 --> 07:33.861
Thanks.

07:33.863 --> 07:38.265
My motto is,
"Live and let live".

07:38.267 --> 07:39.801
I appreciate that.

07:51.246 --> 07:53.179
Don't come in here
asking where your dinner is.

07:53.181 --> 07:56.182
While you've been flouncing
around at your allotment,

07:56.184 --> 07:59.784
I've been at work all day.
So, no. I haven't cooked yet.

07:59.786 --> 08:04.756
Oh, hi Trev!
Nice T-shirt! Mmm.

08:05.825 --> 08:09.260
Trevor!
I didn't say I was hungry.

08:09.262 --> 08:11.028
I heard you think it.

08:11.030 --> 08:13.032
No, well, we left you some.

08:14.434 --> 08:17.034
Thanks.

08:17.036 --> 08:19.038
That's very generous of you!

08:20.973 --> 08:23.773
I'm the one bringing the
money in while you're indulging

08:23.775 --> 08:26.310
in some pathetic male fantasy.

08:26.312 --> 08:29.379
Well, as Harriet can attest,
it is possible to do both.

08:29.381 --> 08:31.481
You know, maybe you should just
embrace the dual nature of your

08:31.483 --> 08:33.950
business, and call
the salon, "Hand Job".

08:33.952 --> 08:36.219
Oooh! You're looking
very pretty today Harriet.

08:36.221 --> 08:38.154
Would you mind if I, umm?

08:40.390 --> 08:43.124
I'm going off to
Graham's. Help me, God!

08:45.796 --> 08:50.098
He's not the sharpest tool in
the shed, is he, your husband?

09:04.413 --> 09:06.146
Yeah, well,
you know what I think?

09:06.148 --> 09:08.482
I think you should
unleash some of that old

09:08.484 --> 09:10.251
Casimir vengeance on him.

09:10.253 --> 09:12.151
Graham, I'm not
going to kill someone

09:12.153 --> 09:14.387
for trying to evict me
from my bloody allotment.

09:14.389 --> 09:17.357
Or you could get that guy
you think's a serial killer to

09:17.359 --> 09:19.492
dissolve him in a
vat of acid or something.

09:19.494 --> 09:22.027
I didn't say he was a serial
killer. I said he was creepy,

09:22.029 --> 09:23.929
and it's weird
his plot is bare earth.

09:23.931 --> 09:26.599
Or maybe you could put
pesticide in his Horlicks,

09:26.601 --> 09:29.834
dress him up as a scarecrow,
and hide him in plain sight?

09:29.836 --> 09:32.604
What is wrong with you?
I'm not going to kill anyone.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.205
Yeah, well you weren't
this squeamish when you were

09:34.207 --> 09:37.208
fire-bombing my zombies earlier.

09:37.210 --> 09:40.412
You really have no grip
on the real world do you?

09:40.414 --> 09:43.116
Well I guess you
could learn how to garden.

09:50.255 --> 09:52.289
Oh, I got that picture
of Harriet you wanted.

09:52.291 --> 09:53.490
But this is the
last time, alright?

09:53.492 --> 09:56.192
Everybody's starting
to think I'm a weirdo.

09:56.194 --> 10:00.195
My sweet Lady Harriet Morana.

10:00.197 --> 10:04.266
Sir Brandt at your service!

10:04.268 --> 10:07.336
I can't believe
you're basing Morana on her.

10:07.338 --> 10:10.406
Oh, yes! She's fit!

10:10.408 --> 10:13.575
Plus, Sir Brandt
gets to bed her!

10:13.577 --> 10:16.411
Only because no one
else in her army has a pulse.

10:16.413 --> 10:19.514
Yes, she has a whole legion
of skeletons at her command,

10:19.516 --> 10:21.915
yet it is I, Sir Brandt,

10:21.917 --> 10:24.452
who gets to bone her! Haha.

10:24.454 --> 10:26.521
You know, there are far
hotter women on the internet,

10:26.523 --> 10:27.921
some wearing a lot less?

10:27.923 --> 10:29.290
Arrrgh, aargh,
no, no, no, no, n...

10:29.292 --> 10:31.225
What is your
problem with the internet?

10:31.227 --> 10:33.460
Online Gamers.

10:33.462 --> 10:37.364
Heathens. Heathens, man!

10:37.366 --> 10:40.334
Oh, go on, send me
that picture would you?!

10:40.336 --> 10:42.068
I don't even know why
you have a mobile phone.

10:42.070 --> 10:43.537
You never
bloody leave the house!

10:43.539 --> 10:46.406
Hey, don't knock my Agoraphobia.

10:46.408 --> 10:50.175
Plus, I need a way to
get my DLA you know. My er...

10:50.177 --> 10:52.977
Dragon Living
Allowance. Yes, very good.

10:52.979 --> 10:54.446
Why can't I have a dragon?

10:54.448 --> 10:57.150
Well, firstly
Morana is a necromancer.

10:58.352 --> 11:01.453
Well, why can't I
have an undead dragon?

11:01.455 --> 11:04.288
- Sending.
- No, no, wait! Wait!

11:04.290 --> 11:06.623
- Ahhh!
- Ahahaha.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.058
Whoops!

11:08.060 --> 11:09.161
You cheat!

11:10.162 --> 11:12.296
When they're down, they're down!

11:12.298 --> 11:14.298
Shouldn't leave your
phone on the battlefield!

11:14.300 --> 11:16.433
Curse you Casimir!

11:16.435 --> 11:20.503
The dead shall rise,
and tear your world asunder!

11:20.505 --> 11:22.638
Tell that to a couple of D8's.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.173
Boom!

11:28.546 --> 11:30.548
Arrrggh.

11:39.956 --> 11:41.458
Arrrgh.

11:58.708 --> 12:00.409
Bobbi?

12:06.682 --> 12:10.482
Ssstupid, bloody whale.

12:10.484 --> 12:13.252
Bobbi, d...

12:17.291 --> 12:18.993
I'll be on the sofa.

12:26.666 --> 12:28.533
Hello and welcome back. Ah,

12:28.535 --> 12:29.767
Right, coming up
'you are what you eat'

12:29.769 --> 12:34.138
we look at the pitfalls and
benefits of a protein only diet.

12:34.140 --> 12:37.208
But first, Dick. What do we
make of this macabre business?

12:37.210 --> 12:39.243
Oh ho. Just in case you're
tuning in for the first time

12:39.245 --> 12:41.144
folks, what Dave is
referring to is the apparent

12:41.146 --> 12:43.012
grave robbing in
Nunhead cemetery.

12:43.014 --> 12:45.482
Hahaha. I think,
I think grave robbing is a bit strong...

12:45.484 --> 12:47.350
No, no, no.
We-well, what would you call it then?

12:47.352 --> 12:49.519
Ahh-uhh, prrff,
Halloween pranks?

12:49.521 --> 12:51.488
Haha, Well it's not like
the corpses just got up and

12:51.490 --> 12:52.722
walked off is it? Hahaha!

12:52.724 --> 12:55.090
Hahaha I'd like to see!

12:55.092 --> 12:58.561
So Dave, what's in store for
us today in terms of the weather?

12:58.563 --> 13:01.129
Well Dick, it's a proper
Autumnal day out there today,

13:01.131 --> 13:04.600
but you can expect a lot of
heavy low lying fog tonight.

13:04.602 --> 13:06.669
So, do be careful
if you're out and about.

13:06.671 --> 13:09.137
Trevor?

13:09.139 --> 13:10.140
Trevor!

13:11.575 --> 13:14.276
Trevor you planning
on sleeping all day?!

13:15.745 --> 13:18.245
- TREVOR!?
- Whaa!

13:18.247 --> 13:20.447
Ow! What, Jesus?

13:20.449 --> 13:21.648
Just because
you're between jobs,

13:21.650 --> 13:23.450
doesn't mean you can lay
around doing fuck all every day!

13:23.452 --> 13:25.185
You should
be out looking for a job!

13:25.187 --> 13:27.087
And pick your dirty
clothes up from the floor.

13:27.089 --> 13:28.221
Is that for me?

13:28.223 --> 13:29.422
No, you make your own.

13:29.424 --> 13:31.457
And your dad's golf clubs are
over there, so take 'em to the

13:31.459 --> 13:33.292
charity shop because it's
not like you play, is it?

13:33.294 --> 13:34.660
I might have to start.

13:34.662 --> 13:35.695
You know what Trevor,

13:35.697 --> 13:38.666
you know better than
to fucking argue with me!

13:40.101 --> 13:42.103
- Pfftt.
- Oh!

13:46.707 --> 13:49.241
God, I swear you only started
smoking to aggravate my asthma!

13:49.243 --> 13:52.377
You ungrateful sod! I'm doing
it to lose weight, for you!

13:52.379 --> 13:54.144
Yeah, is that why you
didn t eat all the extra large

13:54.146 --> 13:55.112
pizza as well?

13:55.114 --> 13:57.649
Do you know what
Trevor? I'm going to work.

13:57.651 --> 14:01.219
You know, remember
work?! You fucking lazy sod!

14:03.823 --> 14:08.124
Ahhh! Fuck.

14:08.126 --> 14:10.427
Oh, Christ.

14:10.429 --> 14:12.128
Kill me!

14:12.130 --> 14:14.130
Come on, boy!

14:14.132 --> 14:17.534
I am a very, very bad horse.

14:17.536 --> 14:20.737
Horses don't talk!

14:20.739 --> 14:22.538
Quiet!

14:22.540 --> 14:25.675
Horses just buck!

14:26.678 --> 14:28.410
Stop.

14:30.481 --> 14:31.479
Haha!

14:44.294 --> 14:46.663
Giddy up!

14:49.231 --> 14:52.699
Come on! Oh, woah! Derek?

14:52.701 --> 14:54.901
Dereeeek?

14:54.903 --> 14:57.104
Come on. T-t-t-t-t.

14:58.707 --> 14:59.708
To-oot?

15:01.175 --> 15:02.678
Darling?

15:04.679 --> 15:07.178
Remember the safe word!

15:08.316 --> 15:11.684
Well, that's not it!
Come on, it's banana.

15:11.686 --> 15:13.852
Derek?

15:13.854 --> 15:15.186
DEREK?

15:17.324 --> 15:19.757
Dark cow!

15:19.759 --> 15:22.527
Oh, yeah. I gave you some pizza!

15:22.529 --> 15:24.361
Stupid bloody friend.

15:24.363 --> 15:28.600
Little ho. Little pfft. Fucking
stupid! Gosh, she's such a lit...

15:28.602 --> 15:31.568
Bloody wha... I'm stupid. Must
have she grab my cock in the

15:31.570 --> 15:33.303
night club. Next thing I know,

15:33.305 --> 15:35.638
I'm bloody
married to her for life.

15:35.640 --> 15:37.342
Poor Derek!

15:38.242 --> 15:40.543
All he wanted was an
early morning ride, wasn't it?

15:40.545 --> 15:44.313
It's alright. Go on.

15:44.315 --> 15:46.215
Well, you know, he wanted
to play his favorite game,

15:46.217 --> 15:47.650
you know, that.

15:47.652 --> 15:49.819
Horsey play.

15:49.821 --> 15:52.754
He loved that!

15:52.756 --> 15:55.890
No, but I just kept on
really pushing it, and saying,

15:55.892 --> 15:58.893
"giddy up, giddy up,
faster" spanking his ass!

15:58.895 --> 16:01.296
And I was getting
really into it, and-

16:01.298 --> 16:05.900
It just uh, it got too much for
him. And he collapsed on me.

16:05.902 --> 16:07.101
Oh, he didn't?!

16:07.103 --> 16:09.236
And there was nothing I could
do, and I was saying, "Say the

16:09.238 --> 16:11.772
safe word, say the safe word".

16:11.774 --> 16:13.874
And he didn't. He just
kept on going, " Pfffft"

16:13.876 --> 16:16.644
And I forgot, he's got
such a delicate little heart.

16:16.646 --> 16:17.845
Oh, his little heart!

16:17.847 --> 16:19.245
And that's why
I really liked him,

16:19.247 --> 16:21.717
cause he was
actually a real gent.

16:24.251 --> 16:26.819
Poor Derek.

16:26.821 --> 16:29.354
Oh, God.

16:29.356 --> 16:33.593
Oh, Bobbi.
Oh, do you know what?

16:33.595 --> 16:35.597
He's still wearing my buttplug.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.767
He is. He's still wearing my
buttplug. They're gonna find

16:41.769 --> 16:43.802
my buttplug up
there. That's not dignified.

16:43.804 --> 16:45.269
He wouldn't have want that.

16:45.271 --> 16:47.304
Nope. Nope.

16:47.306 --> 16:48.641
That's awkward.

16:49.877 --> 16:51.742
Stupid cow.

16:51.744 --> 16:54.311
Stupid. I might as well
just put a bloody bed in here

16:54.313 --> 16:55.578
and be done with it.

16:55.580 --> 16:57.315
...Bloody.

17:00.619 --> 17:02.320
Parsons!

17:04.356 --> 17:05.922
What?

17:05.924 --> 17:08.758
Is it true?
Are you distilling vodka?

17:08.760 --> 17:09.626
What's it to you?

17:09.627 --> 17:11.827
What's it to me,
you little cock head?!

17:11.829 --> 17:13.529
Not that you'd
be affected by it,

17:13.531 --> 17:15.396
but a number of us
had our potato crops

17:15.398 --> 17:16.665
plundered last year.

17:16.666 --> 17:18.967
- Aww!
- And I'd be willing to bet

17:18.969 --> 17:21.637
that if you are
indeed distilling vodka,

17:21.638 --> 17:23.872
then you're
probably the plunderer.

17:23.874 --> 17:26.809
Hahahaha.
I'm the potato plunderer?

17:26.810 --> 17:29.309
Me? Whose allotment
looks like a pile of shit?!

17:29.311 --> 17:31.779
Do you think I could be
bothered to dig up potatoes?

17:31.781 --> 17:33.881
Look at my hands.
Look how clean they are.

17:33.883 --> 17:35.983
You think I could be bothered
to muddy them up to get your

17:35.985 --> 17:39.519
dirty ass potatoes because this
is a little bit of "newsflash",

17:39.521 --> 17:41.689
they're available in
a fucking supermarket,

17:41.691 --> 17:43.657
and they're a pound! But then
you probably didn't know that

17:43.659 --> 17:46.358
did you? You bloody
wanna be English moron.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.527
You watch your
tone, you little twat!

17:48.529 --> 17:50.596
Twat?! Hahahaha.

17:50.598 --> 17:52.465
Twoa! Twat! What
are you gonna do now?

17:52.467 --> 17:54.500
Bludgeon me with
that spade? Give it to me!

17:54.502 --> 17:56.302
'Cause if there's gonna be any
bludgeoning happening today,

17:56.304 --> 17:57.770
I will not be on
the receiving end!

17:57.772 --> 17:58.671
You are mad!

17:58.673 --> 18:01.372
You don't know the
fucking half of it!

18:01.374 --> 18:03.808
Yeah, run!
Run little American boy!

18:03.810 --> 18:06.578
It's pronounced,
"twot" You bloody American!

18:06.580 --> 18:08.446
I'm Canadian!

18:13.019 --> 18:16.722
Mr. Parsons? Mr. Parsons?

18:18.891 --> 18:21.425
Mr. Parsons?!

18:27.333 --> 18:28.799
Bobbi! Bobbi,
something terrible has happened!

18:28.801 --> 18:29.933
Get out!

18:29.935 --> 18:31.934
What the hell are you doing?

18:31.936 --> 18:33.369
- What are y...
- Go away!

18:33.371 --> 18:36.407
Oh! Oh! Oh! God! Oh!

18:36.975 --> 18:39.407
Well, on that note, I don t
think he'll be coming back!

18:39.409 --> 18:42.845
Mm mmm. Oooh, that's nice!

18:42.847 --> 18:45.480
For a moment, I
actually felt like Casimir!

18:45.482 --> 18:48.083
I was like moving towards him,
and he was like, stepping back.

18:48.085 --> 18:52.386
I could see the
fear in his eyes. It was...

18:52.388 --> 18:56.892
- What?
- What is that, on your shoulder?

18:56.894 --> 19:00.095
Oooh! Oh, God! Christ!

19:00.097 --> 19:04.299
Oh, God. Bobbi was giving
Harriet a wax on her lady bits.

19:04.766 --> 19:06.599
- Hand it over!
- What?

19:06.601 --> 19:07.767
- Give it.
- No!

19:07.769 --> 19:09.636
- Yes. Yes!
- No.

19:09.638 --> 19:11.138
No way!

19:11.140 --> 19:12.639
- Come on, now.
- That's sick man.

19:12.641 --> 19:13.773
I'm not doing it.

19:13.775 --> 19:16.778
I'll give you one
sword of Chronos.

19:18.713 --> 19:21.513
Sword of Chronos and an
extra D8 on my combat roles?

19:21.515 --> 19:24.018
Ahhh, D4?

19:26.053 --> 19:27.519
Just don't do
anything disgusting with it.

19:27.521 --> 19:28.522
Ah.

19:30.024 --> 19:32.624
I can smell her Labia.

19:32.626 --> 19:34.760
You are a revolting man!

19:34.762 --> 19:36.093
I know.

19:36.095 --> 19:38.462
So, you were saying?

19:38.464 --> 19:40.798
Right. Yeah, so he
kinda hobbles off, falls over,

19:40.800 --> 19:43.568
and doesn't
bloody get up again.

19:57.448 --> 19:59.117
Oh, fuck.

20:01.586 --> 20:03.088
Oh, God.

20:07.758 --> 20:10.592
Bloody hippie leaving his
bloody tools laying around.

20:10.594 --> 20:12.560
So that's the serial killer?

20:12.562 --> 20:14.462
A hippie serial killer, really?

20:14.464 --> 20:15.797
Oh, it's a great cover.

20:15.799 --> 20:18.600
No. Birch is the
hippie. Doc is th...

20:18.602 --> 20:19.901
Serial killer!

20:19.903 --> 20:20.902
Creepy cowboy guy.

20:20.904 --> 20:22.104
Anyway, you're meant to
tread on the rake and

20:22.106 --> 20:24.705
have it hit you in the face.
You're not meant to fall on it

20:24.707 --> 20:26.540
and have it brain
you. It's just not funny!

20:26.542 --> 20:29.077
Oh. It kinda is.

20:29.079 --> 20:31.445
Well, and convenient!

20:31.447 --> 20:33.147
So, what'd you do next?

20:33.149 --> 20:34.815
I managed to drag
him back to my shed.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.516
Ahh!

20:37.853 --> 20:39.854
Nearly bloody killed me.

20:46.661 --> 20:47.994
I'm gonna have
to go to the Police.

20:47.996 --> 20:49.795
No way, man!
You'll look guilty as hell.

20:49.797 --> 20:50.730
It was an accident.

20:50.732 --> 20:52.832
Well, so why did
you move the body then?

20:52.834 --> 20:54.133
I don't know.

20:54.135 --> 20:56.501
What if somebody
heard or saw the argument?

20:56.503 --> 20:57.569
I don't know!

20:57.571 --> 20:59.804
Well, you should definitely
dispose of the corpse.

20:59.806 --> 21:02.473
Graham, you really have
no grip on the real world.

21:02.475 --> 21:04.910
Oh, spoken like
a true hypocrite.

21:04.912 --> 21:07.913
Why don't you just bury it
in the serial killer's plot?

21:07.915 --> 21:09.915
Oh, that's at the
other end of the allotment.

21:09.917 --> 21:12.116
Finish me off
dragging his fat ass back there.

21:12.118 --> 21:14.785
Well, bury it in yours then. I
mean if it's as messy as you say

21:14.787 --> 21:16.719
then nobody will ever find it.

21:16.721 --> 21:19.123
Christ! Even the thought
of dragging him another foot

21:19.125 --> 21:21.524
gives me a bloody asthma attack.

21:21.526 --> 21:23.559
Arrffff.

21:49.218 --> 21:50.753
Ohh.

21:57.226 --> 21:59.793
I'll think of something.

21:59.795 --> 22:01.928
Maybe.

22:33.625 --> 22:35.892
I think you should
unleash some of that old

22:35.894 --> 22:38.530
Casimir vengeance on him.

22:47.772 --> 22:50.039
Some imagination you've got?!

22:50.041 --> 22:51.640
It's my fantasy.

22:51.642 --> 22:54.643
Ha! You could've given
me some armor or something.

22:54.645 --> 22:56.645
And I mean, what the
hell's that supposed to be?

22:56.647 --> 22:58.647
Like I said, it's my fantasy.

22:58.649 --> 23:00.151
Really?

23:03.887 --> 23:06.821
Suck on that, Potter!

23:06.823 --> 23:10.058
You can have her
Sir Brandt. Make the most of it.

23:10.060 --> 23:13.728
For she will soon be as dead as
the vile creatures she commands.

23:13.730 --> 23:18.632
Oh yeah? We'll see about that.

23:39.020 --> 23:43.024
Ha-ha! You cannot
defeat us both Wizard!

23:44.159 --> 23:45.224
Yield!

23:45.226 --> 23:48.660
The cold lure of this
grave-robbing vixen was enough

23:48.662 --> 23:51.296
to turn you
from faith, eh, Palladin?

23:51.298 --> 23:56.000
Ha. Do not mock my
new faith, Bumblebore!

23:56.002 --> 23:58.936
and you know nothing of the
heat that heat that lies between

23:58.938 --> 24:03.408
that Vixen's legs. But you will
feel the sting of her blade,

24:03.410 --> 24:07.143
When she cuts your
legs from beneath you.

24:14.986 --> 24:18.121
Sorry!
I thought you were one of them.

24:18.123 --> 24:21.827
Don't waste any time. Find
your sanctuary. Go to ground!

24:25.729 --> 24:26.995
What?

24:26.997 --> 24:30.000
It's the big one!
I must document everything!

26:20.436 --> 26:23.836
There remains a multitude
of unanswered questions first and

26:23.838 --> 26:27.273
forth most regarding the cause
of this horrible turn of events.

26:27.275 --> 26:29.175
I can't believe, but
when it comes down to it,

26:29.177 --> 26:32.110
the only fact that matters is
the one we can no longer ignore.

26:32.112 --> 26:35.480
And that is, that it seems, and
I still find it hard to put into

26:35.482 --> 26:38.217
words, despite having
seen evidence first hand.

26:38.219 --> 26:43.021
We're genuinely in the midst
of an actual zombie apocalypse.

26:43.023 --> 26:46.258
Now joining me in discussion
for these "end of days"

26:46.260 --> 26:48.459
is Kevin Bartlett. Now
Kevin, hello and welco...

26:48.461 --> 26:51.062
Yeah, yeah, hi John.
What I'd like to say I'm happy to be here

26:51.064 --> 26:54.498
Er quite! So,
er what's your take on this whole debacle?

26:54.500 --> 26:57.301
Well, first of all,
I could've predicted this would happen.

26:57.303 --> 27:00.204
I-I did it, I know, I know
but I-I look. I mean look,

27:00.206 --> 27:02.838
We've been obsessed forever,
with bloody zombie this and

27:02.840 --> 27:05.475
zombie that. Do you know how
many zombie films are churned

27:05.477 --> 27:06.809
- out each year.
- Quite a few I'm sure.

27:06.811 --> 27:10.413
Er yep, m-my theory,
and you mentioned earlier about not

27:10.415 --> 27:13.583
knowing the "how" of all this.
Well, I'll tell you exactly how

27:13.585 --> 27:17.254
this has all fucking happened.
Sorry, can I swear John? Well

27:17.256 --> 27:20.054
it doesn't matter now does it?
It's simple, and testament to

27:20.056 --> 27:23.224
the towering power of the media
and the public conscience.

27:23.226 --> 27:25.927
We've spent so long fawning over
these shuffling bags of bones,

27:25.929 --> 27:30.399
reveling in film after film, TV
shows, books, video games, and

27:30.401 --> 27:33.935
hoaxes, people have been
genuinely waiting for this day.

27:33.937 --> 27:37.337
And why? Because with this kind
of PR it would be rude to have

27:37.339 --> 27:39.373
a fucking zombie apocalypse.

27:39.375 --> 27:43.379
- Er Kevin, can I stop you there.
- Yeah, wha-what's going on bud?

27:46.915 --> 27:50.083
I think. I thi...

27:50.085 --> 27:51.786
No, no!

27:57.425 --> 27:59.058
Let's get to the roof!

27:59.060 --> 28:00.226
Well, to the helicopter!

28:00.228 --> 28:02.463
Fucking helicopter? What?

28:28.554 --> 28:30.256
Ohh!

28:55.378 --> 28:56.544
It's alright for you.

28:56.546 --> 28:59.647
You don t have to hack up
and bury the people you kill!

29:09.325 --> 29:11.193
Casmir the Cremator.

29:12.160 --> 29:14.862
That's got a
bit of a ring to it!

29:17.666 --> 29:19.534
Right, back to work.

29:26.574 --> 29:28.607
Ooh, oh!

29:28.609 --> 29:31.276
Ohh. Ugh.

29:35.048 --> 29:37.115
Alight Mr. Parsons.

29:37.117 --> 29:39.620
Let's not keep
your legs waiting!

29:42.188 --> 29:44.355
Unfortunately you're going to be
spending the rest of eternity in

29:44.357 --> 29:47.023
my disgrace of a plot.

29:47.025 --> 29:49.560
I'll try and tidy up for you.

29:49.562 --> 29:53.096
God, I'll be glad to
see the back of you.

29:53.098 --> 29:54.099
Ugh.

29:56.703 --> 29:59.904
God! You are one ugly bastard!

30:01.339 --> 30:04.041
Ahh! What the fuck?!

30:06.277 --> 30:08.279
Ahh! Ahh! Oh, God!

30:12.683 --> 30:15.383
Get off my crotch! Ahh!

30:15.385 --> 30:18.188
Ahh! Ahhh!

30:19.556 --> 30:21.558
Bloody open you.

30:23.427 --> 30:26.694
Ahh! Aahhh!

30:26.696 --> 30:31.030
Ugh! Help! Heeeelp!

30:31.032 --> 30:34.101
I've got half a gardner
in here! He's trying to kill me!

30:34.103 --> 30:36.605
Help me! Heeeelp!

30:41.710 --> 30:45.111
Please, help! He's got
my legs, he's got my legs!

30:45.113 --> 30:47.112
He's got, ohh god he's got!

30:47.114 --> 30:50.117
You fucking door! Ahhh!!!

30:52.454 --> 30:56.556
Pleeease! Ahh! Ahhhhh!

30:56.558 --> 30:59.124
Oh, God! Oh, God!

31:05.465 --> 31:10.401
Oh, God! Ahh! Ahh!
Ahhh! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh, God!

31:10.403 --> 31:12.303
Ahh, God!

31:31.656 --> 31:33.658
Ohh! Ohh!

31:37.495 --> 31:42.498
- You!
- Ahh. Ahhhh. Aghhhhh!

31:42.500 --> 31:44.166
The only thing is, you
were actually more annoying

31:44.168 --> 31:45.667
when you were alive.

31:48.639 --> 31:50.640
Help! Help!

31:54.744 --> 31:57.578
Heeeeelp! Agh!

31:57.580 --> 32:00.347
Aghh! Heeeeelp!

32:09.591 --> 32:13.192
I know a cry for
help when I hear one.

32:13.194 --> 32:15.196
Come on, Birchy boy!

32:18.366 --> 32:22.168
Ahh! Ahhh! Aaaaahhh!

32:28.408 --> 32:31.209
Four bars,
half battery! Booyahhhhh!

32:31.211 --> 32:33.411
Right, Bobbi.

32:33.413 --> 32:34.414
Right.

32:36.716 --> 32:38.782
Come on, Bobbi.
Come on. Answer, answer.

32:38.784 --> 32:40.551
Answer the phone.

32:51.230 --> 32:53.632
There's more of
them. They've got her.

32:55.199 --> 32:57.198
Aghhaaahh!

33:02.640 --> 33:05.343
I have to make another
call. Don't you ever get tired?

33:08.580 --> 33:10.579
Shhh!

33:13.483 --> 33:17.351
Thank you for calling 999,
the UK's leading emergency service.

33:17.353 --> 33:19.721
Your call is currently in a
queue and will be dealt with

33:19.723 --> 33:22.826
as soon as one of our
operators becomes available.

33:23.593 --> 33:26.159
For God's sake!

33:39.274 --> 33:42.474
Your call is important to us.
Thank you for your patience.

33:42.476 --> 33:44.276
- Please continue to ho...
- For God's sake!

33:55.756 --> 33:58.456
Oh, you like that do you? Ohhh!

34:05.565 --> 34:08.766
Who'll be at home, who'll
be at home, who'll be at home?

34:08.768 --> 34:11.838
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Graham

34:13.304 --> 34:15.839
Oooh, Mistress Morana!

34:15.841 --> 34:19.976
Oh! Oh, mistress!

34:19.978 --> 34:21.978
Oh! Ughh.

34:25.884 --> 34:29.318
Jesus, T! You scared
the crap out of me!

34:29.320 --> 34:31.386
Good thing I'm on the crapper.

34:31.388 --> 34:34.757
God, that is a disgusting image!
Look, look, I need your help.

34:34.759 --> 34:35.858
Kinda busy.

34:35.860 --> 34:37.692
Doing what?

34:37.694 --> 34:40.963
Umm, polishing my sword.

34:40.965 --> 34:43.630
Look, even though you've got a
sword, I know that means your

34:43.632 --> 34:46.233
penis! Can you just put it away
in your pants and fucking come

34:46.235 --> 34:49.237
and help me?
We've got a situation.

34:52.741 --> 34:54.341
What's that noise?

34:54.342 --> 34:59.246
That's the
situation. Mr. Parsons is now

34:59.248 --> 35:01.281
zombie Parsons!

35:01.283 --> 35:02.948
Hahaha! shut up.

35:02.950 --> 35:05.618
I'm serious Graham!
Look, I only called Bobbi.

35:05.620 --> 35:08.254
I think they already got her.

35:08.256 --> 35:12.024
Wait a minute. Am I on bloody
speaker phone? And who's they?

35:12.026 --> 35:15.730
Do you b...?
The bloody zombies that's who!

35:19.933 --> 35:21.900
I'm not the first
person you called?

35:21.902 --> 35:24.703
You're not the second either.
I've got bloody 999 on hold as

35:24.705 --> 35:25.704
we speak.

35:25.706 --> 35:28.573
Ha, you put 999 on hold?

35:28.575 --> 35:30.975
Well they put me on hold first!

35:30.977 --> 35:32.844
Yeah, I hate it
when they do that.

35:32.846 --> 35:35.378
It's bloody ridiculous. Anyway
look, I'm trapped in the shed

35:35.380 --> 35:37.413
somehow. I can't get out. And I
need you to come down here...

35:37.415 --> 35:39.515
Well, I can't.

35:39.517 --> 35:41.451
What? Something more pressing?

35:41.453 --> 35:44.387
Look, ughh. Just twat
the thing over the head and

35:44.389 --> 35:47.623
bash your way out. I mean, it's
a shed. I'm sure you'll manage.

35:47.625 --> 35:49.559
Are you, are you kidding me?

35:49.561 --> 35:52.461
Look, I've gotta go. I'll
see you tonight, alright?

35:52.463 --> 35:53.996
No.

35:53.998 --> 35:56.565
No! No.

35:56.567 --> 35:59.269
No! Ahhh!

35:59.870 --> 36:03.505
Fuuuuuck! Fuck! Idiot!

36:03.507 --> 36:05.640
Ahhhhhh!

36:05.642 --> 36:08.509
Ohhh.

36:08.511 --> 36:11.881
Ohhhhh, yessss!

36:12.315 --> 36:15.549
Is this call a
genuine emergency? If so...

36:31.066 --> 36:34.268
Ahh! Ahh! Ahhhh! Ahhh! Ahh!

36:42.943 --> 36:45.778
My shoe! My shoe!

36:45.780 --> 36:48.046
Ugh! Ahh!

36:48.048 --> 36:49.715
That's my bloody shoe!

36:49.717 --> 36:52.617
Give me my shoe!
Give me my bloody shoes!

36:52.619 --> 36:55.354
That was my last pair of Nike's!

36:55.554 --> 36:57.387
Please continue to hold.

36:57.389 --> 36:59.422
One of our operators
will be with you shortly.

36:59.424 --> 37:00.992
Now, a word from our sponsors.

37:00.994 --> 37:05.062
Are you suffering
from stabbing pain, headaches?

37:05.064 --> 37:08.765
The kind of stubborn pain
that sits right behind your eyes

37:08.767 --> 37:10.766
and won't go aw...

37:10.768 --> 37:12.470
Ahhh!

37:15.473 --> 37:19.510
No! no, no! Nooo! Not
now! Not now! Nooo! Nooo!

37:38.895 --> 37:40.862
Ahh! Ahhh!

37:50.973 --> 37:53.874
Hahahaha. Hahaha. Ahh.

38:07.521 --> 38:09.821
Oh, you wanna
get that roof fixed!

38:09.823 --> 38:10.824
You mind?

38:29.709 --> 38:32.577
By the way, I did
take your potatoes.

38:35.046 --> 38:37.180
Sorry mate, I seriously
thought you were joking earlier!

38:37.182 --> 38:39.515
It's fine.

38:39.517 --> 38:41.684
What, so you wore a helmet,
but you didn't bring a sword?

38:41.686 --> 38:43.853
Yeah, look, it's one thing
walking around town wearing

38:43.855 --> 38:45.921
this, which, by the way,
is a very clever move,

38:45.923 --> 38:48.790
but I can't be dragging
a sword around town.

38:48.792 --> 38:50.592
It's bloody heavy for starters.

38:50.594 --> 38:53.195
Well, at least you
got over your agoraphobia.

38:53.197 --> 38:55.529
Yeah, yeah alright,
I'm not agoraphobic. Fine.

38:55.531 --> 38:56.765
Surprise.

38:56.767 --> 39:00.102
Look, at least I came, yeah?
It's bloody dangerous out here!

39:00.104 --> 39:02.003
I saw two women
eating another woman.

39:02.005 --> 39:03.838
What, did you
watch it on your phone?

39:03.840 --> 39:06.207
Not like that!
And I saw some hippie

39:06.209 --> 39:08.675
chewing some blokes arm off!

39:08.677 --> 39:10.679
Oh, bloody vegans!

39:12.781 --> 39:14.614
I think we should
head to the coast.

39:14.616 --> 39:16.549
- What?
- Well, there might be boats.

39:16.551 --> 39:18.684
- That's a stupid fucking idea!
- No, it's not.

39:18.686 --> 39:20.819
Yes it is. Where's Bobbi?

39:20.821 --> 39:23.089
- I dunno. I think they got her.
- You think?

39:23.091 --> 39:24.224
Can't be sure.

39:24.226 --> 39:25.927
Harriet's with Bobbi.

39:27.862 --> 39:30.796
We need to save our women!

39:30.798 --> 39:33.731
We really, we, we really don't.

39:33.733 --> 39:35.934
I cou...

39:35.936 --> 39:39.103
So my thinking is, you
know what choice does she have?

39:39.105 --> 39:42.507
Suicide? Becoming a sex
slave for a heavily armed gang?

39:42.509 --> 39:44.609
Donating her
brain to the hungry?

39:44.611 --> 39:45.843
Well none of
that's likely to happen.

39:45.845 --> 39:48.146
I think it's more likely than
her shacking up with you in some

39:48.148 --> 39:50.614
post-apocalyptic wasteland.

39:50.616 --> 39:53.216
Hahahaha. You wait.

39:53.218 --> 39:56.186
Chicks dig a
knight in shining armor!

39:56.188 --> 39:57.988
What the hell?

39:57.990 --> 40:02.726
God! I think
it's Peter? Well, part of him.

40:02.728 --> 40:04.795
What, you can
tell just from his arm?

40:04.797 --> 40:06.195
No.

40:06.197 --> 40:07.732
The camera.

40:12.236 --> 40:16.571
My name is Peter Jones.
I'm a-well, I'm doing my masters in

40:16.573 --> 40:20.577
agriculture, but that's doesn't
matter right now. Start again.

40:22.212 --> 40:26.814
My name is Peter Jones,
and I'm a concerned citizen.

40:26.816 --> 40:29.783
If you're watching this these
could be the very last recorded

40:29.785 --> 40:33.154
thoughts of mankind. It's
not too late for you though.

40:33.156 --> 40:37.192
You can escape. These
things are slow and cumbersome.

40:37.194 --> 40:41.594
Ahh! Ahh-ahh! Ahhhh! ahhh!

40:41.596 --> 40:46.065
Ah-ahhaha!
Ahh-ha! Oohoohoo! Ahhh!

40:46.067 --> 40:48.601
Ahhh! Oh, God!

40:48.603 --> 40:51.804
Oh, Jesus! Oh, Christ!

40:51.806 --> 40:56.608
Ahh-haha! Aaaah! Ah-ha!

41:04.251 --> 41:05.917
Documenting the
zombie apocalypse?

41:05.919 --> 41:07.052
Who the hell's gonna
watch it?

41:07.054 --> 41:08.922
Us apparently!

41:10.223 --> 41:12.957
Oh, Christ! And now
they're best buddies. Great.

41:12.959 --> 41:14.792
Well, if you cant
eat 'em, join 'em.

41:14.794 --> 41:16.894
Right, I'll take
Peter, you take Ted!

41:16.896 --> 41:17.862
What about her?

41:17.864 --> 41:20.331
She's got a dodgy
leg. She'll be a while.

41:20.333 --> 41:23.067
Come on, you!

41:23.069 --> 41:25.071
Come ooon, youuu!

41:27.605 --> 41:29.738
Ahh! Take that you idiot!

41:29.740 --> 41:32.741
Ah! Yes! Ugh! Ug! h

41:32.743 --> 41:35.844
- Do they die this way?
- I'm not sure!

41:35.846 --> 41:39.850
- Take that! Take that!
- Ugh! Ugh!

41:40.751 --> 41:43.254
- Ahh!
- Oh, God. No!

41:53.096 --> 41:57.100
No, Doc. No, no,
It's, it's me. Ahh!

42:01.303 --> 42:03.737
Thank you?

42:03.739 --> 42:04.905
Yeah, thanks Doc.

42:04.907 --> 42:06.608
Don't mention it.

42:09.645 --> 42:11.978
You look like you've been busy.

42:11.980 --> 42:14.413
It's like fucking Christmas.

42:14.415 --> 42:17.183
I've got a more
traditional approach to

42:17.185 --> 42:19.187
Christmas myself but,

42:21.255 --> 42:24.890
You know I don't know why you're
looking so shocked Trevor.

42:24.892 --> 42:29.195
I saw what you did
to Parsons. Very impressive.

42:29.197 --> 42:30.727
Thank you.

42:30.729 --> 42:33.233
So, ugh, what's in the bag?

42:34.401 --> 42:37.770
- You don't want to know.
- Huh, I do. Hm.

42:40.173 --> 42:41.772
Oh!

42:41.774 --> 42:44.242
- Oh, heads!
- Heads?

42:44.244 --> 42:46.945
Yeah! hahaha.

42:49.814 --> 42:52.382
What's in the other bag?

42:52.384 --> 42:54.218
You really don't want to know.

42:54.220 --> 42:56.222
Hm. Pretty open-minded.

43:03.428 --> 43:06.630
Oh! Fu... ohh!

43:07.731 --> 43:08.997
Ohh!

43:08.999 --> 43:13.368
Lady parts. You know, If you
soak 'em in vinegar long enough,

43:13.370 --> 43:17.405
Just like calamari.

43:17.407 --> 43:20.174
We have to go!

43:20.176 --> 43:21.976
Ah, I've got to
go and see my wife.

43:21.978 --> 43:24.011
Yeah, and Harriet.

43:24.013 --> 43:26.313
Well, hasta la vista guys.

43:26.315 --> 43:27.848
Maybe see you around?

43:27.850 --> 43:29.717
Yeah, better hope not.

43:29.719 --> 43:32.153
Especially if
you're one of them.

43:32.155 --> 43:34.287
You know they're not human.

43:34.289 --> 43:38.825
Best thing to do is, you see
'em, kill 'em. Simple right?

43:38.827 --> 43:41.928
Noted. Thank you
very much. Very useful.

43:41.930 --> 43:43.363
I would hope you'd
do the same for me.

43:43.365 --> 43:45.864
- Yeah.
- You see me shuffling around,

43:45.866 --> 43:49.371
kill me. 'Cause I don't
wanna be one of the living dead.

43:52.206 --> 43:55.773
I wanna be one
of the dead, dead.

43:55.775 --> 43:57.777
Dead, dead. Got it.

44:02.015 --> 44:06.350
Well, don't worry.
I'll clean up your mess.

44:06.352 --> 44:07.884
Alright.

44:07.886 --> 44:09.353
Okay, thank you.

44:09.355 --> 44:12.255
I told you he
was a serial killer!

44:12.257 --> 44:15.093
Ahhaaahh!

44:19.465 --> 44:21.264
That's something
you don't see everyday.

44:21.266 --> 44:23.132
Yeah.

44:23.134 --> 44:25.167
This is your street isn't it?

44:25.169 --> 44:30.072
Yeah, alright, keep up with me.
Keep your eyes open. Let's go!

44:30.074 --> 44:32.474
Bollocks!

44:49.926 --> 44:51.428
Oh!

45:01.070 --> 45:04.036
Lie still, Sir Casimir!

45:04.038 --> 45:07.008
You are wounded.
But you will live.

45:08.076 --> 45:10.077
I'll make sure of it.

45:15.182 --> 45:18.451
So beautiful. Who are you?

45:18.453 --> 45:22.120
My name is Ophelia.
And these are my sisters,

45:22.122 --> 45:24.124
Iphelea and Upheleme.

45:29.563 --> 45:34.233
We are honored to tend to
someone so brave as you.

45:35.835 --> 45:39.436
We are humbled
by your presence.

45:39.438 --> 45:44.309
Yet, I would still
beg for one small favor.

45:45.977 --> 45:46.978
Anything.

45:49.948 --> 45:52.615
A kiss

45:52.617 --> 45:55.918
from your brave lips.

45:55.920 --> 45:58.922
Should you
have the strength, sire?

45:59.423 --> 46:00.424
Hmm.

46:20.008 --> 46:23.209
My sisters would
ask the same favor.

46:23.211 --> 46:25.914
should you have the strength?

46:30.951 --> 46:32.987
Think so.

46:35.657 --> 46:37.189
- Oh!
- Hahaha.

46:37.191 --> 46:38.357
Welcome back, T!

46:38.359 --> 46:41.661
Oh, Thanks.

46:41.663 --> 46:43.896
How long was I out?

46:43.898 --> 46:45.631
Oh, a couple of days.

46:45.633 --> 46:48.166
Oh, Christ!
What's it like out there?

46:48.168 --> 46:51.002
Hahaha. Just kidding!

46:51.004 --> 46:53.037
Before you start on me,

46:53.039 --> 46:56.107
you look like a bloody zombie
because you're covered in blood.

46:56.109 --> 46:59.344
If you'd come to the
front door. Oh, no sorry, wait.

46:59.346 --> 47:02.212
I suppose you lost your
keys as well as your inhaler.

47:02.214 --> 47:05.282
Do you know what Trevor? You
are so rubbish when it comes to

47:05.284 --> 47:08.352
crisis like this,
you really fucking are.

47:08.354 --> 47:11.455
Oh, come on Bobbi, he's
just woken up, give him a break.

47:11.457 --> 47:14.460
No, because he's a
lazy bastard, Harriet!

47:15.627 --> 47:17.660
Why's she wearing my shirt?

47:17.662 --> 47:20.864
I think that's
obvious. Hmhmmhmm.

47:21.932 --> 47:25.434
Well, faced with the
imminent prospect of death

47:25.436 --> 47:30.272
they, uh, finally gave
into their sapphic whims.

47:30.274 --> 47:32.073
What?

47:32.075 --> 47:34.076
I think they had sex!

47:37.447 --> 47:39.449
Now, that I'd like to see.

47:44.253 --> 47:46.188
Well, half of it anyway. Haha.

47:47.591 --> 47:49.723
Hey, don't stretch
that. That's my favorite.

47:49.725 --> 47:52.427
It was until you
"tittied" it up!

47:55.130 --> 47:59.031
Oh, Christ!
Oh, I need to take a shower.

47:59.033 --> 48:01.735
There's more pressing
things than you washing Trevor.

48:01.737 --> 48:04.704
Are there Bobbi? Are there
really? 'Cause let me tell you

48:04.706 --> 48:07.439
something. While you've been in
here munching on your friend,

48:07.441 --> 48:10.342
the world out there
has gone to absolute shit!

48:10.344 --> 48:13.011
So before this
apocalypse really kicks in,

48:13.013 --> 48:15.247
I'd like one last shot
at some hot water, okay?

48:15.249 --> 48:17.749
So my suggestion to you
is, shut your fucking mouth,

48:17.751 --> 48:20.152
and put the
immersion on! 'Cause right now,

48:20.154 --> 48:22.620
I really wanna wash
these fucking brains off me.

48:22.622 --> 48:24.755
I don't think there's
any need to swear at me

48:24.757 --> 48:27.558
Yes, there is actually!
There's every fucking need!

48:27.560 --> 48:29.326
And may I point
out that thus far,

48:29.328 --> 48:31.995
the only injury I've received
is from my fuckwit of a wife

48:31.997 --> 48:34.698
and not from a fucking zombie!

48:34.700 --> 48:39.669
- Trevor?
- Apology fucking accepted!

48:39.671 --> 48:43.005
Right, I'm now going
upstairs to take a shower.

48:43.007 --> 48:45.073
Stay away from the
doors and windows, alright?

48:45.075 --> 48:47.477
Just keep quiet,
everything will be fine,

48:47.479 --> 48:50.582
we'll sort everything
else out when I get back.

48:57.420 --> 48:59.422
Well, that was awkward. Err?

49:44.364 --> 49:47.064
So, you "Bi" then?

49:47.066 --> 49:48.833
Who said that?

49:48.835 --> 49:51.036
Well, you know, you and Bobbi?

49:52.806 --> 49:55.473
Maybe I'm a lesbian.

49:55.475 --> 49:57.741
Maybe? What, you don't know?

49:57.743 --> 50:00.677
No darling, you don't know.

50:00.679 --> 50:05.682
Nah, I don't buy it.
All that stuff at the salon.

50:05.684 --> 50:08.687
We all want a
happy ending Graham.

50:11.790 --> 50:14.523
Well,

50:14.525 --> 50:17.661
I guess we're never
going to get one now.

50:20.197 --> 50:21.198
Trevor?

50:23.835 --> 50:25.001
- What?
- Oh, for God's sake,

50:25.003 --> 50:28.703
I've seen that pathetic
excuse for a penis enough times.

50:28.705 --> 50:32.139
Well your vagina s.
rubbish. what do you want?

50:32.141 --> 50:34.642
Oh, for God's. Is that
any way to talk to your wife?

50:34.644 --> 50:38.379
Eh? Anyway, look,
I just wanted to say 'sorry'.

50:38.381 --> 50:40.648
You know, about,
about the old Harriet thing.

50:40.650 --> 50:42.683
And I know
you're pissed off.

50:42.685 --> 50:45.885
- I'm really not.
- But, if it's any consolation,

50:45.887 --> 50:48.588
it's 'cause she
wanted a threesome with us.

50:48.590 --> 50:49.422
She what?

50:49.424 --> 50:53.493
Ah. See,
I thought you'd like that.

50:53.495 --> 50:56.498
Just.

51:17.750 --> 51:20.818
How is he?

51:20.820 --> 51:21.821
Ugh.

51:23.221 --> 51:27.225
Ugh. Morana! Morana! Oh, God!

51:28.660 --> 51:32.796
Oh, yeah.
Morana. Oh, Morana.

51:32.798 --> 51:36.799
- Ohhhhh!
- Oh, Casimir!

51:36.801 --> 51:39.668
You're so HUGE!

51:39.670 --> 51:42.438
Much bigger than Sir Brandt.

51:42.440 --> 51:44.940
Oh, yes! Fill me!

51:44.942 --> 51:49.611
Morana you dirty
little temptress! Aghh, Ohh!

51:49.613 --> 51:53.715
Oh yes, I've never been
filled like this before!

51:53.717 --> 51:57.518
Feel my power Morana!
Feel my power inside you!

51:57.520 --> 52:00.521
Fill me with your staff
of power! It's so good!

52:00.523 --> 52:04.425
Oh, you're so huge! Oh, Casimir!

52:04.427 --> 52:06.693
- Feel my power!
- Oh! Oh! Give it to me!

52:06.695 --> 52:09.596
- Ohh! Ohh!
- Give it to me!

52:09.598 --> 52:11.531
- Ohh!
- Casimir!

52:11.533 --> 52:13.432
Alright, lover. Do you
mind if I sit of your face

52:13.434 --> 52:15.468
while you fuck my friend? Haha!

52:15.470 --> 52:19.575
Ooh! Oh! Oh, God! Oh!

52:22.242 --> 52:23.976
- What the hell?
- Zombies!

52:23.978 --> 52:27.512
- They've got in!
- My face!

52:27.514 --> 52:30.415
- It's Harriet's fault!
- Hey!

52:30.417 --> 52:31.919
You muppets!

53:17.260 --> 53:19.596
Feel my, feel my power!

53:21.565 --> 53:23.765
I could of sworn
I heard something.

53:23.767 --> 53:25.533
Like what?

53:25.535 --> 53:27.902
I dunno.

53:27.904 --> 53:32.773
Fucking Trevor. Why'd
he have to come back?

53:32.775 --> 53:37.444
I know, right. When we
were having so much fun!

53:37.446 --> 53:40.547
I'm wet just thinking about it.

53:40.549 --> 53:42.514
You're a very bad girl!

53:42.516 --> 53:46.520
There! Didn't you hear that?

53:59.799 --> 54:00.832
Ahh!

54:03.570 --> 54:06.573
Ah, Stop! Ah! Ohh!

54:08.675 --> 54:11.609
Oh, my God! Run! Zombies!

54:11.611 --> 54:13.312
Zombies!

54:22.721 --> 54:24.521
- What the hell?
- Zombies!

54:24.523 --> 54:27.858
- They've got in!
- My face!

54:27.860 --> 54:31.660
What did I say?
Tell me, what did I say?

54:31.662 --> 54:34.362
I said, stay away from
the doors and windows.

54:34.364 --> 54:37.032
These things. Anything but
advertise our presence.

54:37.034 --> 54:39.467
That's all you had to do.
Literally everything.

54:39.469 --> 54:42.637
And yet I get five minutes to
clean up and somehow you,

54:42.639 --> 54:46.540
mouth breathers, manage
to let in pervy Uncle Fester!

54:46.542 --> 54:48.109
It wasn't me T!

54:48.111 --> 54:51.345
I know Graham. I know.

54:51.347 --> 54:53.514
My face, it really hurts!

54:53.516 --> 54:55.849
I'm sorry about that
Harriet, I really am, although

54:55.851 --> 54:56.918
I could say, I told you so.

54:56.920 --> 54:59.686
Oh, don't be
so bloody smug Trevor.

54:59.688 --> 55:03.056
And why shouldn't I be smug,
Bobbi? For once something

55:03.058 --> 55:07.360
terrible has happened and it
isn't my bloody fault! Hahahaha!

55:07.362 --> 55:08.363
Ugh.

55:09.798 --> 55:10.799
Fuck.

55:27.548 --> 55:29.049
Ahhhhhh?

55:40.059 --> 55:41.060
Ohh.

55:46.431 --> 55:49.600
Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shh!

56:00.511 --> 56:01.512
Christ!

56:12.822 --> 56:15.558
Shh! Shhh! Shhh!

56:20.530 --> 56:23.964
Wait. Wait.

56:23.966 --> 56:25.966
I Think they've
headed to the bedroom.

56:25.968 --> 56:28.702
We need to make a break for it.

56:28.704 --> 56:30.170
Make a break for it?

56:30.172 --> 56:33.206
Ugh, yes!
The compound is breached!

56:33.208 --> 56:35.108
What we gonna do about her?

56:35.110 --> 56:36.642
Well, she comes too!

56:36.644 --> 56:40.813
No, she's been, uh...

56:40.815 --> 56:43.916
Listen, if we
go, we've gotta go now!

56:43.918 --> 56:45.517
I can't go out in just a towel!

56:45.519 --> 56:46.585
Oh, man up!

56:46.587 --> 56:47.786
I'll man up when you
give me your bloody clothes.

56:47.788 --> 56:50.089
Well, why don't you go to
the bedroom then, and slip into

56:50.091 --> 56:51.556
something a little
more comfortable,

56:51.558 --> 56:53.490
with dead fucking Derek?!

56:53.492 --> 56:55.059
- Shit!
- No, he's right.

56:55.061 --> 56:56.895
He needs clothes.

56:56.897 --> 56:58.897
Thank you, Graham.

56:58.899 --> 57:02.499
You're gonna have to kill Derek.

57:02.501 --> 57:06.503
You expect me to wrestle
a zombie in just a towel?

57:06.505 --> 57:09.472
That's really, that's
really supportive. Thank you.

57:09.474 --> 57:13.811
Fucking sake! Do
not leave me alone with him!

57:15.014 --> 57:17.014
I'm still here Bobbi!

57:17.016 --> 57:20.083
I know, I know
mate. I just meant...

57:20.085 --> 57:22.952
Bloody Derek!

57:22.954 --> 57:24.955
I gave him a discount even.

57:27.191 --> 57:28.558
I did!

57:30.694 --> 57:33.795
Fine. Fine.

57:33.797 --> 57:35.797
I'll do it.

57:35.799 --> 57:37.499
I'll deal with Derek.

57:37.501 --> 57:38.600
Oh, you don't
have to do that mate.

57:38.602 --> 57:41.902
No, no, no. No, no.
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

57:41.904 --> 57:45.572
Ugh, I'll distract him while
you go and get on a pair of

57:45.574 --> 57:47.576
bloody trousers and shit.

57:49.645 --> 57:52.212
You'd do that just for me?

57:52.214 --> 57:53.582
Yes, mate.

57:55.885 --> 57:58.284
Give us a hug!

57:58.286 --> 58:00.987
Uhh, okay. Enough of that.

58:00.989 --> 58:01.921
That's uhh...

58:01.923 --> 58:04.759
That, that was not,
not to do with that.

58:06.593 --> 58:09.862
Okay, ugh, we'll be right back.

58:25.279 --> 58:26.646
Ughhuhh.

58:36.755 --> 58:39.089
Harr-Harriet?

58:39.091 --> 58:42.625
What's happening to me?

58:42.627 --> 58:45.629
You're going to be okay,
alright? You're gonna be fine.

58:53.337 --> 58:55.039
Stay behind me.

59:03.279 --> 59:06.282
I can't believe
Derek actually bit me.

59:08.018 --> 59:11.788
He's usually so gentle with me.

59:14.991 --> 59:18.994
Yeah. I-I-I told Trevor that
you'd have a threesome with us.

59:22.663 --> 59:23.999
Oh, God.

59:29.071 --> 59:31.937
I really didn't,
I didn't mean it.

59:31.939 --> 59:33.905
This is for
fucking the lovely Morana!

59:33.907 --> 59:36.710
You festering
piece of offal! Ahh!

59:37.711 --> 59:38.712
Ahh!

59:50.222 --> 59:52.925
Go on, Trevor! I've got this!

59:59.832 --> 01:00:03.069
Ahhh! Ahha! Ahhhh!

01:00:09.174 --> 01:00:10.175
Ah!

01:00:17.415 --> 01:00:19.749
See! All those times you
bitched at me for leaving

01:00:19.751 --> 01:00:21.985
clothes on the
floor. And now it pays off!

01:00:24.922 --> 01:00:28.023
Is she turning?

01:00:28.025 --> 01:00:30.858
Oh, I think so, yeah.

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:33.195
Right so, that's you
fully dressed then?

01:00:33.197 --> 01:00:35.199
Well, it's a start isn't it?

01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:42.136
Harriet? I know seems
horribly inappropriate but

01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:44.371
do you think I could
possibly have my t-shirt now?

01:00:44.373 --> 01:00:46.072
Oh, for fucks
sake Trevor, come on!

01:00:46.074 --> 01:00:47.073
What?

01:00:47.075 --> 01:00:48.942
Just why don't you get
some dirty ones out the

01:00:48.944 --> 01:00:50.743
laundry basket
or something? Why?

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:54.880
You've got to be shitting me!

01:00:54.882 --> 01:00:56.915
Graham.

01:00:56.917 --> 01:00:59.284
Cheers mate!

01:00:59.286 --> 01:01:02.289
Hey, I told you I had it?

01:01:04.792 --> 01:01:06.293
Now I have!

01:01:08.428 --> 01:01:09.629
What?

01:01:15.702 --> 01:01:18.136
- What, I've got two.
- Ugh.

01:01:18.138 --> 01:01:20.173
I'd forgot it
was in there, alright?

01:01:25.410 --> 01:01:29.246
I have laid waste
to your enemy my lady!

01:01:29.248 --> 01:01:31.950
Vengeance is yours!

01:01:34.752 --> 01:01:36.353
We're fucked mate.

01:01:36.355 --> 01:01:37.954
You two should
probably get out,

01:01:37.956 --> 01:01:41.023
you know, before any of
the others find their way in.

01:01:41.025 --> 01:01:42.026
Yeah.

01:01:50.368 --> 01:01:52.867
I'll never forget this.

01:01:52.869 --> 01:01:55.373
Oh, right, Trev.
Come on, let's go.

01:01:59.942 --> 01:02:03.076
So long, Sir Brandt!

01:02:03.078 --> 01:02:05.346
Farewell, brave Casim...

01:02:05.348 --> 01:02:08.516
Oh, for fucks sake. Come
on, Sir Wankalot. Let's go.

01:02:08.518 --> 01:02:11.220
- Sorry.
- Bye, Bobbi.

01:02:17.392 --> 01:02:19.394
Thought you might need this.

01:02:22.197 --> 01:02:24.297
I didn't know you cared.

01:02:24.299 --> 01:02:26.000
Oh, don't be silly.

01:02:28.502 --> 01:02:30.704
Well, I'm sorry about Harriet.

01:02:31.772 --> 01:02:35.874
I'm sorry about.

01:02:35.876 --> 01:02:37.878
- Graham.
- Yeah.

01:02:56.529 --> 01:02:58.995
Graham?

01:02:58.997 --> 01:03:00.563
I know my love.

01:03:00.565 --> 01:03:04.101
This is the only
end I could of wished for too.

01:03:08.072 --> 01:03:10.939
I want

01:03:10.941 --> 01:03:15.877
to ea-eaaa...

01:03:15.879 --> 01:03:20.881
I, I want you.

01:03:20.883 --> 01:03:23.152
I want you.

01:03:31.227 --> 01:03:33.226
Come on, let's beat this thing.

01:03:35.998 --> 01:03:38.000
- Come on.
- We should get going.

01:03:39.268 --> 01:03:41.034
Were you serious about
that threesome by the way?

01:03:41.036 --> 01:03:42.469
Because, umm, if you were,

01:03:42.471 --> 01:03:44.571
there might still
be other people alive.

01:04:48.198 --> 01:04:49.199
Balls!

01:04:52.468 --> 01:04:54.470
- Double balls!
- Yeah!

01:04:56.172 --> 01:04:59.473
Hey, numb nuts!

01:04:59.475 --> 01:05:01.908
Say hello to my little friend!

01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:02.909
Ahh!

01:05:07.483 --> 01:05:09.184
Ahhhhh!

01:05:12.187 --> 01:05:14.522
Ain't no ice cream
in your fucking future!

01:05:16.157 --> 01:05:18.090
Doc! Thank God!

01:05:18.092 --> 01:05:21.394
Well, don't thank him. I'm the
one doing all the heavy lifting!

01:05:21.396 --> 01:05:23.995
- Is this the wife?
- Oh yeah, Bobbi.

01:05:23.997 --> 01:05:26.398
- Bobbi Doc, Doc Bobbi.
- Nice!

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.699
Hiya!

01:05:27.701 --> 01:05:29.200
Why don't you take the lady,

01:05:29.202 --> 01:05:32.169
and I will handle
the rest of these fuckers!

01:05:32.171 --> 01:05:34.071
Lady?

01:05:34.073 --> 01:05:36.641
Ah, it's just a figure of
speech, no offense intended.

01:05:36.643 --> 01:05:38.610
No, none taken at all.

01:05:38.612 --> 01:05:41.044
Wh-why don't you come with us?

01:05:41.046 --> 01:05:44.615
No, I'm having too much fun.

01:05:44.617 --> 01:05:47.550
But why don't you take
her some place nice and quiet

01:05:47.552 --> 01:05:49.986
and start to
work on repopulating.

01:05:49.988 --> 01:05:52.991
Looks like she's got
some child-bearing hips.

01:05:56.127 --> 01:05:58.527
I'll see you around.

01:05:58.529 --> 01:06:00.531
Haaaaaaa!

01:06:04.168 --> 01:06:06.301
So why can't you just
be like Doc then, Trevor?

01:06:06.303 --> 01:06:07.736
I'm not going to be
like him. He's a weirdo.

01:06:07.738 --> 01:06:10.038
Right. Well, you're
meant to be the fucking hero.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:12.073
Did you see him? He had,
he had a bag full of vaginas

01:06:12.075 --> 01:06:14.742
and who wears a cowboy hat
outside bloody East London?

01:06:14.744 --> 01:06:16.310
- Wel...
- I, I'm taking you somewhere.

01:06:16.312 --> 01:06:17.745
Alright?

01:06:17.747 --> 01:06:19.480
I'm taking you somewhere
safe, and things are going to be

01:06:19.482 --> 01:06:21.249
better. We're going to
be able to live off the land.

01:06:21.251 --> 01:06:23.116
We're going to be able to
start again. Everything's gonna

01:06:23.118 --> 01:06:24.285
be great,
alright? I promise you.

01:06:24.287 --> 01:06:27.223
Everything's going to be
incredibly, incredibly amazing.

01:06:33.762 --> 01:06:36.230
So, this is your
somewhere safe then?

01:06:42.103 --> 01:06:46.070
Well, I like
to say "get a life".

01:06:46.072 --> 01:06:48.139
Precious commodity now.

01:06:48.141 --> 01:06:51.144
Yeah, well maybe
you're a sad excuse for one.

01:06:54.247 --> 01:06:57.449
I'm glad you're
still alive Trev.

01:06:57.451 --> 01:06:58.452
Thanks.

01:07:00.186 --> 01:07:01.687
Wait here.

01:07:14.266 --> 01:07:15.434
Oh, Christ!

01:07:17.769 --> 01:07:20.472
Trev?

01:07:24.609 --> 01:07:25.610
Trevor?

01:07:27.445 --> 01:07:30.613
So?

01:07:30.615 --> 01:07:31.781
Come in!

01:07:31.783 --> 01:07:32.982
Cheers!

01:07:37.688 --> 01:07:40.691
Well, at least it's not raining.

01:07:41.692 --> 01:07:44.325
Well, only 'cau-cause
your toys would get wet.

01:07:44.327 --> 01:07:46.761
- They're not toys.
- No. Well, yeah they are.

01:07:46.763 --> 01:07:48.596
No, yo-you wouldn't understand.

01:07:48.598 --> 01:07:51.632
No, Trevor. I understand. I
understand that this is your

01:07:51.634 --> 01:07:54.400
hide-out, and that you'll do
anything else except prepare

01:07:54.402 --> 01:07:55.603
for the fucking world to end.

01:07:55.605 --> 01:07:58.171
But, yeah. I guess I should
of seen that coming should I?

01:07:58.173 --> 01:07:59.405
- Jesus!
- Trevor, Trevor?!

01:07:59.407 --> 01:08:02.442
How are we meant to survive if
all you're doing is playing with

01:08:02.444 --> 01:08:05.444
toys and brewing whatever
the fuck are in them bottles?

01:08:05.446 --> 01:08:08.113
It's not brewing, it's
distilling! And it-it's vodka!

01:08:08.115 --> 01:08:10.482
Right! Okay, then. Well,
I'll tell you what we'll do.

01:08:10.484 --> 01:08:13.820
We'll get really, really pissed
on your moonshine, yeah?

01:08:13.822 --> 01:08:16.688
And then with any luck,
hopefully, hopefully we'll be

01:08:16.689 --> 01:08:19.291
that fucking pissed we won't
feel a thing when the zombies

01:08:19.292 --> 01:08:22.359
come and fucking eat us!

01:08:22.362 --> 01:08:23.426
- What is that?
- Lea-leave it!

01:08:23.429 --> 01:08:24.694
- What Is that?
- Come on, I just came

01:08:24.697 --> 01:08:27.198
in here deliberately before you
so you wouldn't have to see it.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:30.435
You don't want to
see it. It's messy.

01:08:33.805 --> 01:08:35.305
Are you protecting me?

01:08:35.308 --> 01:08:36.840
No, I just don't want
you throwing up in my shed.

01:08:36.841 --> 01:08:39.843
- Are you being a gentleman?
- Hardly.

01:08:39.845 --> 01:08:42.345
Oh, Trevor!

01:08:42.346 --> 01:08:43.813
The one that
used to be so sweet.

01:08:43.814 --> 01:08:46.180
- Don't be ridiculous
- He's back!

01:08:46.183 --> 01:08:47.519
Shut up!

01:08:50.689 --> 01:08:54.557
Look Trevor, you know,
you know about Harriet?

01:08:54.559 --> 01:08:57.459
It's okay. I forgive you.

01:08:57.461 --> 01:09:00.796
Really? Because I-I
was afraid you were dead.

01:09:00.798 --> 01:09:03.866
You know, I just wanted
pleasure before I was too.

01:09:03.868 --> 01:09:06.267
Totally understandable.

01:09:06.269 --> 01:09:08.636
Ah, but, at least there
weren't any men involved.

01:09:08.638 --> 01:09:09.703
There is that.

01:09:09.706 --> 01:09:12.506
And you weren't dead.

01:09:12.508 --> 01:09:13.843
Not yet.

01:09:16.444 --> 01:09:18.813
You know we could.

01:09:18.814 --> 01:09:20.314
What?

01:09:20.316 --> 01:09:22.917
Well, it's been a
long time hasn't it?

01:09:22.919 --> 01:09:25.919
Jesus Bobbi, are you
trying to seduce me?

01:09:25.921 --> 01:09:30.124
Oh, Trevor. I remember the time
where you didn't need seducing.

01:09:31.359 --> 01:09:34.926
What was it that
you used to call it?

01:09:34.929 --> 01:09:36.631
Staff of power.

01:09:37.832 --> 01:09:39.599
- Oop!
- Oh!

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:44.169
- There it is! Eeheehee haha
- Oh. There it is!

01:09:44.171 --> 01:09:46.671
- Ugh. Mmm.
- Oh, Trevor.

01:09:46.673 --> 01:09:49.808
God, it feels
a bit cold you know.

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:53.179
Maybe I should get my
warm mouth over it, yeah?

01:09:56.916 --> 01:10:00.283
Ouch! For fucks sake!

01:10:00.285 --> 01:10:02.786
Bastard fucking.

01:10:02.788 --> 01:10:04.955
Christ almighty little shit!

01:10:04.957 --> 01:10:08.257
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no. Careful with him!

01:10:08.259 --> 01:10:10.861
- Careful with him? With him?
- Can I, can I just have him?

01:10:10.863 --> 01:10:14.196
It's a piece of metal you twat,
that went straight into my leg.

01:10:14.198 --> 01:10:16.766
Straight into my leg as I
was about to suck your dick.

01:10:16.768 --> 01:10:17.934
You ungrateful sod!

01:10:17.936 --> 01:10:19.969
Please, just, just, just,
just give him to me please.

01:10:19.971 --> 01:10:21.436
Just, just, just
let me have him.

01:10:21.438 --> 01:10:24.239
Oh God, Gandalf the fucking gay!

01:10:24.241 --> 01:10:25.242
Casimir.

01:10:29.445 --> 01:10:31.812
Cas-im-there, now!

01:10:37.787 --> 01:10:39.489
God damn it!

01:10:41.557 --> 01:10:42.725
Woman!

01:10:45.594 --> 01:10:47.894
- Shit!
- Oh, please Trevor!

01:10:47.896 --> 01:10:49.898
Man the fuck up!

01:10:54.236 --> 01:10:56.603
Oh, shhhit!

01:10:59.474 --> 01:11:02.341
They came back.

01:11:02.343 --> 01:11:04.242
Back? Wh-what do you mean back?

01:11:04.244 --> 01:11:05.746
Back here.

01:11:06.781 --> 01:11:08.783
They're the allotment tenants.

01:11:11.485 --> 01:11:14.953
Well, maybe they're
headed somewhere familiar?

01:11:14.955 --> 01:11:16.888
- Bit like yourself?
- It's dawn of the dead Bobbi.

01:11:16.890 --> 01:11:18.089
This isn't a
fucking shopping mall!

01:11:18.091 --> 01:11:21.291
Well, either way the gardeners
are back. You know, you know

01:11:21.293 --> 01:11:24.996
maybe the-they're
hungry for some fleshier shit

01:11:24.998 --> 01:11:26.563
than fucking cabbage.

01:11:26.565 --> 01:11:27.734
Yeah.

01:11:31.037 --> 01:11:32.236
Fuck.

01:11:33.271 --> 01:11:37.406
Trev, you reckon we
should shut the door lock?

01:11:37.408 --> 01:11:39.742
Trev?

01:11:39.744 --> 01:11:42.045
Fuck off.

01:11:42.047 --> 01:11:43.748
Fuck off!

01:11:56.059 --> 01:11:59.527
Shit, can't stop
making it fucking hurt.

01:11:59.529 --> 01:12:00.530
God.

01:12:12.808 --> 01:12:13.809
Fuck.

01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:27.887
I bet every shed on
this allotment has fucking

01:12:27.889 --> 01:12:32.392
built in super cool
zombie killing gun stuff.

01:12:37.765 --> 01:12:40.466
You could of at least
brought a golf club Trevor!

01:12:48.909 --> 01:12:52.442
Trevor?
Trevor say something.

01:12:52.444 --> 01:12:54.446
Ma-maybe I'm immune.

01:13:07.691 --> 01:13:12.094
Ah, come Casimir!

01:13:12.096 --> 01:13:16.365
We have been at odds for
as long as I can recall, and

01:13:16.367 --> 01:13:20.402
now I must offer
you an Olive branch

01:13:20.404 --> 01:13:22.704
in your time of need.

01:13:22.706 --> 01:13:24.839
Along with some sage advice

01:13:24.841 --> 01:13:27.875
to assist you in
your predicament.

01:13:27.877 --> 01:13:32.445
Thank you, Sir Brandt.
I appreciate your counsel.

01:13:32.447 --> 01:13:37.452
Do you recall the Autumn
campaign some five years past?

01:13:38.955 --> 01:13:43.890
Perhaps you can remind
me of the particulars.

01:13:43.892 --> 01:13:47.127
Hahaha. My Lady Morana,

01:13:47.129 --> 01:13:50.563
great strategist that she was,

01:13:50.565 --> 01:13:54.834
had ordered her main
force to assault your castle,

01:13:54.836 --> 01:13:58.536
whilst sending her seventh
battalion of zombie volunteers

01:13:58.538 --> 01:14:02.841
into the otherwise impenetrable
swamp of Sagra since they would

01:14:02.843 --> 01:14:06.845
be immune to the
poisonous fumes therein.

01:14:06.847 --> 01:14:10.448
Hahaha. Yes, I do recall.

01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:14.985
A glorious pincer movement.
Hahaha. She, uh, cleverly

01:14:14.987 --> 01:14:16.987
fed you the information

01:14:16.989 --> 01:14:20.123
by sacrificing her scouts

01:14:20.125 --> 01:14:22.125
A worthy opponent.

01:14:22.127 --> 01:14:25.095
Knowing that you would
have to divide your forces and

01:14:25.097 --> 01:14:29.465
fight a losing
battle on two fronts.

01:14:29.467 --> 01:14:30.900
But you,

01:14:30.902 --> 01:14:34.503
you brave Casimir,

01:14:34.505 --> 01:14:38.040
took it upon yourself to
take on the seventh alone,

01:14:38.042 --> 01:14:41.978
from a hillside overlooking
the swamp, by hurling balls

01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:44.980
of fire into the
combustible lowlands,

01:14:44.982 --> 01:14:48.717
incinerating the entire
battalion single-handed.

01:14:48.719 --> 01:14:50.785
Yes. Yes!

01:14:50.787 --> 01:14:53.654
before returning to your men and

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:56.157
successfully
repelling my attack.

01:14:56.159 --> 01:14:59.692
Yes, yo-you, you're
saying I should leave Bobbi.

01:14:59.694 --> 01:15:02.196
No you twat! Well
that as well probably.

01:15:02.198 --> 01:15:05.400
I'm saying you
should torch the fuckers!

01:15:08.237 --> 01:15:10.603
I've got it. I know
what we have to do.

01:15:10.605 --> 01:15:11.606
What?

01:15:13.541 --> 01:15:15.574
Right, they're all
round the front, yeah?

01:15:15.576 --> 01:15:16.742
And?

01:15:16.744 --> 01:15:18.810
We douse the shed in Trevoff.

01:15:18.812 --> 01:15:19.878
Trevoff? Fucking hell.

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:22.915
We douse the shed in
Trevoff, open the front door,

01:15:22.917 --> 01:15:25.717
climb out the back, make a
break for it, I'll make one into

01:15:25.719 --> 01:15:27.920
a molotov. We'll chuck
it in. Burn them to death.

01:15:27.922 --> 01:15:30.756
More death. You, you know.
Just, they won't do anything.

01:15:30.758 --> 01:15:31.758
Yeah.

01:16:04.554 --> 01:16:07.058
I'm saving one so
we can celebrate later.

01:16:27.810 --> 01:16:30.813
You know it only takes
one of us to open the door?

01:16:33.682 --> 01:16:35.948
I'm not leaving you.

01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:37.652
Yes, you are.

01:16:39.053 --> 01:16:41.821
Like you said you might be
immune. We can't know for sure.

01:16:41.823 --> 01:16:43.055
- Trevor?
- We can't assume.

01:16:43.057 --> 01:16:45.891
assume makes an ass out of you
and me. That's a famous phrase.

01:16:45.893 --> 01:16:47.026
Trevor?

01:16:47.028 --> 01:16:51.230
- Assumption is the mother of...
- Trevor!

01:16:51.232 --> 01:16:53.934
God, you know better
than to argue with me.

01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:59.639
Just don't let me
become one of them.

01:17:07.612 --> 01:17:11.283
And you were right. I did
start smoking to annoy you!

01:17:15.121 --> 01:17:17.123
Right, just go.
You'll be alright.

01:17:19.624 --> 01:17:22.627
Just don't make me ask
you again, alright? Now, go!

01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:28.233
I said, go! Go.

01:17:54.123 --> 01:17:57.223
You fucking bitches!

01:18:45.036 --> 01:18:49.439
In the months that passed,
Trevor learned to tend the land.

01:18:49.441 --> 01:18:53.876
To survive. He'd all
but forgotten Casimir.

01:18:53.878 --> 01:18:56.812
Hell, he'd become Casimir.

01:18:56.814 --> 01:18:58.948
A bloody hero, as much as any

01:18:58.950 --> 01:19:03.952
man alone can be.
The real heroes he often

01:19:03.954 --> 01:19:07.856
reflected as he worked,
were those that died so

01:19:07.858 --> 01:19:12.861
that he might live. Bobbi.
Graham. He would always

01:19:12.863 --> 01:19:14.865
remember their sacrifices.

01:19:22.704 --> 01:19:24.204
They're not human anymore.

01:19:24.206 --> 01:19:28.210
They're dead.
When you see 'em, you kill 'em.

01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:33.980
And I hope you'd
do the same for me?

01:19:33.982 --> 01:19:36.781
'Cause I don't wanna
be one of the living dead.

01:19:36.783 --> 01:19:39.254
I wanna be one
of the dead, dead.

01:19:42.123 --> 01:19:45.924
And he'd eventually
learn the most basic of lessons

01:19:45.926 --> 01:19:49.161
for surviving a
zombie apocalypse.

01:19:49.163 --> 01:19:54.165
When you find a good weapon,
you bloody well hold on to it!

01:20:00.742 --> 01:20:04.774
