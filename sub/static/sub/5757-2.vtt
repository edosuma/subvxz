WEBVTT

00:05.473 --> 00:08.709
( screams ) IF YOU LOVE
MY SISTER, YOU WON'T DO THIS!

00:08.742 --> 00:10.611
( grunts, screams )
( bell tolls )

00:10.644 --> 00:12.613
IS THIS SOME KIND OF A JOKE?

00:12.646 --> 00:14.648
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THERE'S NOBODY IN THERE.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.450
IF WE WANT ANN TO BELIEVE US,

00:16.484 --> 00:18.519
A PICTURE'S WORTH
 A THOUSAND WORDS.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.654
OH, I SEE YOU FOUND
THE GUEST BEDROOM.

00:20.688 --> 00:23.657
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE
A LOOK AT THE MASTER?

00:23.691 --> 00:25.526
...WE GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH YOUR THERAPIST.

00:25.559 --> 00:28.662
SHE IS RECOMMENDING
YOU SPEND SOME TIME APART.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.798
ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT
I CAN'T SEE MY FRIENDS?

00:30.831 --> 00:32.466
ARE YOU...?
SAMARA.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.668
I GO TO SHERATON PREP.
DID YOUR FRIEND TELL YOU?

00:34.702 --> 00:36.604
YEAH. S-SORRY.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.272
THEY EXTENDED
YOUR DAD'S ASSIGNMENT.

00:38.306 --> 00:39.807
HE WANTS US TO
COME TO TEXAS.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.343
YOU MEAN FOR A VISIT?
FOR A YEAR.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.545
MAKE SURE SHE GETS THIS.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.647
I KNOW ABOUT THE LETTER.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.183
YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO MAKE
THAT DECISION FOR ME.

00:49.217 --> 00:51.352
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I BARELY REMEMBER JASON.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.722
WE DIDN'T KNOW HIM,
HE WAS JUST ALI'S
OLDER BROTHER DOWN THE HALL.

00:54.755 --> 00:57.191
( cell phone dings )
 ANYONE COULD HAVE
 SENT THAT, SPENCE.

00:57.225 --> 00:59.760
IT COULD JUST BE SOME KOOK
 TRYING TO MESS WITH MELISSA.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.562
IT'S NOT SAFE?
 I CAN'T TELL YOU?

01:01.595 --> 01:03.464
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT?
WHERE HE IS.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.866
IAN IS DEAD.
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO KNOW FOR SURE.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.569
"HOW DO I KNOW THIS IS YOU?"

01:08.602 --> 01:10.871
( cell phone dings )
( gasps ) IT'S HIM!

01:10.904 --> 01:12.273
IAN'S ALIVE.

01:12.306 --> 01:13.741
( clatter )

01:19.647 --> 01:21.149
( clatter )

01:26.254 --> 01:29.157
DID THINGS JUST GET
INCREDIBLY WORSE?

01:29.190 --> 01:31.659
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
IAN'S DEAD.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.394
ZOMBIE'S DON'T TEXT!

01:33.427 --> 01:36.197
HE IS ALIVE SOMEWHERE.

01:36.230 --> 01:38.232
SPENCE...

01:38.266 --> 01:41.735
I HAVE TO GET THIS PHONE HOME
BEFORE MELISSA REALIZES
THAT IT'S GONE.

01:41.769 --> 01:44.172
OKAY, YOU PUT IT BACK,
AND THEN WHAT DO WE DO?

01:44.205 --> 01:48.176
DO WE CALL THE COPS?
OH, YEAH, BECAUSE THAT ALWAYS
WORKS OUT SO WELL FOR US.

01:48.209 --> 01:51.245
WHY IS IAN TEXTING MELISSA?
AND WHY IS MELISSA
ANSWERING HIM?

01:51.279 --> 01:54.448
IS SHE? I MEAN, WE DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON.

01:54.482 --> 01:58.186
SPENCER, LOOK,
YOU'VE GOTTA FIND OUT
WHAT IAN TOLD MELISSA.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.154
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN
FIND OUT WHAT HE WANTS.

02:00.188 --> 02:02.356
AND WHERE HE IS.
( clatter )

02:04.192 --> 02:05.159
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!

02:07.495 --> 02:09.530
LET'S FINISH THIS
IN THE MORNING, OKAY?

02:09.562 --> 02:11.832
I'M COLD, DAMP AND SCARED.
WE CAN TALK AT SCHOOL.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.734
WE CAN'T TALK
AT SCHOOL, REMEMBER?

02:13.767 --> 02:16.270
THE FOUR OF US ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE HAVING "SEPARATE TIME."

02:16.304 --> 02:19.373
DOCTOR'S ORDERS.
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO,
NOT TALK TO EACH OTHER?

02:19.407 --> 02:21.475
WE'RE IN THE SAME CLASSES.
WE JUST HAVE TO
PLAY IT COOL.

02:21.509 --> 02:24.478
( clatter )

02:24.512 --> 02:25.679
IT'S JASON.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.484
DID HE MOVE BACK IN?

02:30.518 --> 02:32.686
WHAT IS ALL THAT?
THAT'S ALL THAT STUFF

02:32.720 --> 02:34.188
THAT THOSE PEOPLE
LEFT ON MY CURB

02:34.222 --> 02:35.923
WHEN ALI WENT MISSING,
THOSE TRIBUTES.

02:35.956 --> 02:38.659
MAYA SAID HER FAMILY
KEPT THOSE THINGS
WHEN THEY MOVED IN.

02:38.692 --> 02:41.629
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE HEART
TO THROW THEM OUT.

02:41.662 --> 02:44.332
APPARENTLY
JASON'S MOVED ON.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.267
WHAT'S HE DOING
BACK IN THAT HOUSE?

02:51.939 --> 02:54.775
* GOT A SECRET,
 CAN YOU KEEP IT *

02:54.808 --> 02:57.445
* SWEAR THIS ONE
 YOU'LL SAVE *

02:57.478 --> 02:59.747
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

02:59.780 --> 03:02.483
* TAKIN' THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

03:02.516 --> 03:04.552
* IF I SHOW YOU
 THEN I KNOW YOU *

03:04.585 --> 03:07.388
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

03:07.421 --> 03:12.293
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET
 IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

03:14.762 --> 03:17.831
MOM, YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN
ANY OF THIS THERAPY STUFF,

03:17.865 --> 03:19.733
SO WHY DO I HAVE TO
PUT UP WITH IT?

03:19.767 --> 03:22.736
BECAUSE MOST OF LIFE CONSISTS
OF PUTTING UP WITH SOMETHING.

03:22.770 --> 03:25.473
WOW. WHAT A POSITIVE
OUTLOOK.

03:25.506 --> 03:28.676
THAT'S GONNA HAVE
A TERRIFIC IMPACT ON
MY FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.978
COULD WE NOT TALK ANY MORE
UNTIL WE'VE HAD COFFEE?

03:31.011 --> 03:33.647
AND WHY DID YOU HAVE TO
TURN ON THE "HANNA IN TROUBLE"
BAT-SIGNAL AND CALL DAD?

03:33.681 --> 03:36.617
I DIDN'T. WHEN DAUGHTERS
SHOW UP IN NEWS STORIES

03:36.650 --> 03:39.353
ABOUT A VANISHING CORPSE,
FATHERS CHECK IN.
WELL, HE CAN CHECK IN,

03:39.387 --> 03:42.022
BUT WHY DOES HE HAVE
TO COME HERE?
HE'S WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.658
HE IS.
I HEARD IT WHEN HE CALLED.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.663
LAST TIME HE CAME

03:49.697 --> 03:52.666
HE SPRANG A FIANCE
AND A STEP-DAUGHTER ON US.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.802
WONDER WHAT WE'LL GET
THIS TRIP.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.371
WELL, HE SENT YOU
THAT NICE PLANT WHEN
YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL.

03:57.405 --> 03:58.939
IT DIED, REMEMBER.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.475
YOU STILL HAVE THE POT.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.616
YOU CAN'T TAKE AWAY
MY PHONE.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.884
I'M NOT TAKING IT AWAY.
YOU CAN USE IT ALL YOU WANT.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.520
IT'S JUST WHEN YOU
GET HOME FROM SCHOOL

04:12.553 --> 04:14.288
YOU GOTTA LEAVE IT
ON THE DINING ROOM TABLE.

04:14.322 --> 04:16.524
YOU WANT TO CALL SOMEONE,
CALL FROM DOWNSTAIRS.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.892
SO YOU'LL KNOW IF I'M TRYING
TO TALK TO ARIA, SPENCER
AND HANNA?

04:18.926 --> 04:21.595
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LOOK AT IT LIKE
IT'S A PROJECT.

04:21.629 --> 04:24.064
YOU GET TO EXPERIENCE LIFE
THE WAY IT WAS

04:24.097 --> 04:26.334
BEFORE WE HAD ANYTHING
OTHER THAN LANDLINES.

04:26.367 --> 04:27.868
ARE WE GONNA START
MILKING OUR OWN COWS

04:27.901 --> 04:29.403
AND USING KEROSENE LAMPS, TOO?

04:29.437 --> 04:32.573
LOOK, EMILY,
I KNOW THIS IS HARD,

04:32.606 --> 04:35.409
BUT IT'S NOT MEAN.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.010
I THINK THIS IS
A GOOD IDEA.

04:39.046 --> 04:42.049
YOU BETTER START
THINKING ABOUT PACKING.

04:42.082 --> 04:45.386
SO THE REAL ESTATE PEOPLE
WON'T KNOW THERE WAS
ANYONE LIVING HERE

04:45.419 --> 04:47.020
WHEN THEY TRAMP
THROUGH OUR HOUSE?

04:47.054 --> 04:49.490
ACTUALLY,
NO MORE TRAMPING.

04:49.523 --> 04:52.460
WE HAVE A FAMILY WHO WANTS TO
LEASE THE PLACE FOR A YEAR.

05:15.483 --> 05:17.418
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "GONE"?

05:17.451 --> 05:20.020
I MEAN GONE. BLANK.
ZEROED OUT.

05:20.053 --> 05:22.856
SOMEBODY GOT IN HERE
AND ERASED THE WHOLE DRIVE.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.725
WHO?
 THE REAL ESTATE AGENT'S

05:24.758 --> 05:26.560
BEEN BRINGING PEOPLE IN HERE
 ALL THE TIME.

05:26.594 --> 05:28.729
THE LAPTOP'S BEEN
SITTING ON MY DESK.

05:28.762 --> 05:32.666
ARE YOU SAYING THAT "A" JUST
WALKED IN AND WIPED YOUR DRIVE?

05:32.700 --> 05:35.002
WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT?
OF COURSE THEY DID.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.570
IT'S GONE, SPENCE.

05:36.604 --> 05:38.138
ALL THE VIDEOS OF IAN ARE GONE.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.741
YEAH, EXCEPT FOR THE ONE
IAN HAD WHEN HE FELL.

05:40.774 --> 05:43.143
( door opens )
LOOK, WE'RE GONNA TALK
AT SCHOOL, OKAY?

05:43.176 --> 05:46.480
HOW?
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

05:46.514 --> 05:49.717
HEY. YOU GOT OUT EARLY
THIS MORNING. WHERE'D YOU GO?

05:53.421 --> 05:55.456
OH, WOW.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.526
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

05:58.559 --> 06:00.461
SO FAR.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.530
THEY WANT ME TO REST
AS MUCH AS I CAN.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.100
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO GO ALONE.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.802
I WOULD HAVE GONE WITH YOU.

06:08.836 --> 06:11.805
NEXT TIME.

06:11.839 --> 06:14.542
UM, ANY MORE
APPOINTMENTS TODAY?

06:14.575 --> 06:17.411
NO. I'M STAYING HOME.

06:17.445 --> 06:20.981
ARE YOU GONNA BE BACK
BEFORE MOM AND DAD LEAVE?

06:21.014 --> 06:23.651
THAT'S THE PLAN.

06:25.786 --> 06:26.920
YOU KNOW,

06:26.954 --> 06:29.623
I COULD STAY HOME
IF YOU WANTED ME TO.

06:29.657 --> 06:32.560
ANSWER YOUR PHONE,
TAKE MESSAGES.

06:32.593 --> 06:36.864
NO, UM...
I WANT MY PHONE.

06:36.897 --> 06:40.634
IN CASE THE POLICE CALL
ABOUT IAN.
YEAH.

06:44.772 --> 06:47.107
THANKS.
YEAH.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.142
( school bell rings )

06:49.176 --> 06:51.111
( students chatter )

06:54.682 --> 06:57.184
ARIA, CAN I SEE YOU
FOR A SECOND?

06:58.519 --> 07:00.454
SO...

07:00.488 --> 07:03.023
YOUR LAST DAY
IS FRIDAY.

07:03.056 --> 07:05.058
DAY AFTER TOMORROW.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.160
THANKS FOR THE WARNING.

07:07.194 --> 07:09.530
IT'S...NOT A WARNING.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.767
ALL OF A SUDDEN I FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE PICKING APART

07:13.801 --> 07:15.803
EVERYTHING I SAY
WITH A PAIR OF TWEEZERS.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.938
NO, I JUST...
WANT TO MAKE SURE

07:17.971 --> 07:20.474
THAT I'M NOT
MISUNDERSTANDING
ANYTHING.

07:20.508 --> 07:21.675
SUCH AS?

07:21.709 --> 07:25.613
SUCH AS WHAT
I CAN REALLY EXPECT

07:25.646 --> 07:28.181
ONCE YOU PACK UP
THAT DESK.

07:28.215 --> 07:31.685
I THINK I'VE BEEN
VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

07:31.719 --> 07:35.022
YEAH. I KNOW
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.224
I'M JUST NOT SO SURE.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.793
( hallway
chatter )

07:39.827 --> 07:43.531
WELL, WE'RE NOT GONNA
FIGURE THIS OUT
BEFORE THE NEXT BELL.

07:43.564 --> 07:46.066
YOU NEED TO COME BY
THE APARTMENT SO WE CAN TALK.

07:48.936 --> 07:50.270
I CAN'T TONIGHT.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.371
TOMORROW.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.277
( sighs )

07:57.310 --> 07:58.846
OKAY.

08:04.652 --> 08:07.621
HEY, BIG A!
WAIT UP.

08:07.655 --> 08:10.290
SO, THAT WAS A BOMBSHELL,
WASN'T IT?

08:10.323 --> 08:13.060
DID YOU SEE IT COMING
ABOUT HIM LEAVING?

08:13.093 --> 08:15.028
NO.
LISTEN,

08:15.062 --> 08:17.731
IF I BEND SOME ARMS,
WE COULD GET HIM A GIFT.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.933
AND I THOUGHT
YOU COULD PICK IT OUT.
WHY ME?

08:19.967 --> 08:22.603
WELL, YOU KNOW HIM BETTER.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.772
FROM THE PLAY.
RIGHT.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.674
UH, SURE.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.208
I'LL PICK
SOMETHING UP.

08:28.241 --> 08:32.111
PRIMO.
I'LL SHAKE PEOPLE DOWN.
I LOVE DOIN' THAT.

08:32.145 --> 08:35.783
UM, THERE IS THIS ONE OTHER
REALLY SMALL THING
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

08:35.816 --> 08:37.217
ANYTHING BETWEEN
YOU AND HANNA

08:37.250 --> 08:39.019
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
WORK OUT ON YOUR OWN.

08:39.052 --> 08:41.121
CAN'T YOU JUST
SAY SOMETHING TO HER?
MONA,

08:41.154 --> 08:43.857
HANNA AND I AREN'T
REALLY HANGING OUT
RIGHT NOW.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.594
WHY?
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

08:46.627 --> 08:48.829
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

08:48.862 --> 08:52.132
DON'T YOU READ THE PAPERS
OR LISTEN TO THE NEWS?

08:52.165 --> 08:53.901
NO.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.703
ALI'S KILLER?

08:55.736 --> 08:57.605
OH. RIGHT.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.239
YOU LYING TO THE COPS.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.974
OH, WE DIDN'T
LIE TO THE COPS.

09:01.008 --> 09:03.310
PEOPLE THINK THAT WE DID,
BUT WE DIDN'T.

09:03.343 --> 09:07.080
SO NOW OUR PARENTS
ARE THINKING THAT WE JUST
SHOULDN'T HANG OUT AS MUCH.

09:07.114 --> 09:09.917
OH. THAT'S SO UNFAIR.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.185
SO I'LL GET THE GIFT
FOR MR. FITZ,

09:12.219 --> 09:15.155
BUT I CAN'T HELP YOU
WITH HANNA.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.857
THAT'S OKAY.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.627
I'LL COME UP
WITH SOMETHING.

09:19.660 --> 09:22.062
Aria:
 SO THE VIDEOS ARE GONE?

09:22.095 --> 09:23.664
TOTALLY GONE.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.232
THAT WAS OUR
ONLY EVIDENCE.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.200
WELL, WE DON'T HAVE IT
ANYMORE.

09:27.234 --> 09:30.270
HAS IAN SENT MELISSA
ANY MORE MESSAGES?
I DON'T KNOW.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.806
SHE'S NOT LEAVING
HER PHONE SITTING AROUND.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.908
WHAT ABOUT JASON?
WHY IS HE BACK?

09:34.942 --> 09:36.343
AND WHAT IS HE DOING
IN THAT HOUSE?

09:36.376 --> 09:39.713
MAYBE HE'S JUST LOOKING
FOR CLOSURE OR SOMETHING.

09:39.747 --> 09:42.349
OKAY, NEW RULE:
NO ONE CAN SAY
THE WORD "CLOSURE."

09:42.382 --> 09:45.252
EVER.
DR. SULLIVAN
SAYS IT ALL THE TIME.

09:45.285 --> 09:48.288
I REST MY CASE.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.161
HAN.
WHAT?

09:54.194 --> 09:55.963
I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD
SIT TOGETHER.

09:55.996 --> 09:58.131
WE ALWAYS SIT TOGETHER.
WE HAVE TO MAKE IT
LOOK LIKE

09:58.165 --> 10:00.033
WE'RE GOING ALONG
WITH THIS.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.870
LOOKING LIKE WE'RE DOING IT
IS THE SAME THING AS DOING IT.

10:02.903 --> 10:05.673
IT MEANS WE'RE WRONG.
AND WE'RE NOT WRONG;
WE'RE RIGHT.

10:05.706 --> 10:08.642
ARE WE? WE DON'T EVEN
REALLY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

10:08.676 --> 10:10.277
HOW CAN WE BE SURE
IF WE'RE EVEN RIGHT?

10:10.310 --> 10:13.681
THAT'S EVEN MORE REASON
TO STICK TOGETHER.

10:27.427 --> 10:29.296
( chatter )

10:32.365 --> 10:35.936
( cell phones dings )

10:54.722 --> 10:56.256
YOU'RE HERE.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.358
I HAD TO GET SOME PAPERS
FROM THE OFFICE.

10:58.391 --> 11:01.161
YOU'RE COMING BACK
TO SCHOOL?
I HAVEN'T CHANGED MY MIND.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.697
THIS IS ABOUT
GETTING A G.E.D. ON MY OWN.

11:03.731 --> 11:08.435
LOOK, I'M THE ONE
WHO LOOKS GUILTY,
NOT YOU.

11:08.468 --> 11:11.438
YOU CAN COME BACK
IF YOU WANT TO.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.874
THE THING IS,
I DON'T WANT TO.

11:13.907 --> 11:17.010
YOU'RE THE ONE LOOKING FORWARD
TO CLASS REUNIONS, NOT ME.

11:17.044 --> 11:21.014
BESIDES, I GOT A JOB.
HMM?

11:21.048 --> 11:23.751
CHECK IT OUT.

11:23.784 --> 11:26.754
THEY NEEDED SOMEBODY FULL-TIME,
AND I'LL BE LEARNING
FROM THE BEST.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.256
I MEAN, SWEENEY PUT UP
HALF THE HOUSES IN THIS TOWN.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.691
HOW ARE YOUR PARENTS
ABOUT THIS?

11:33.060 --> 11:35.929
MY FAMILY IS THE REASON
WHY I'M DOING IT.

11:37.898 --> 11:41.468
THE SOONER I'VE GOT SOME MONEY
THE SOONER I'M OUT OF THERE.

11:41.501 --> 11:42.770
FOR GOOD.

11:44.772 --> 11:46.940
OUT OF ROSEWOOD?

11:46.974 --> 11:49.476
WELL, THAT DEPENDS.

11:49.509 --> 11:50.811
ON WHAT?

11:50.844 --> 11:52.813
DIFFERENT THINGS.

11:52.846 --> 11:55.082
WELL, NAME THREE.

11:55.115 --> 11:58.919
I CAN ONLY THINK
OF ONE RIGHT NOW.

12:02.289 --> 12:05.258
* ( female vocalist
 singing alternative pop ) *

12:12.265 --> 12:15.936
( chatter )

12:15.969 --> 12:19.472
WOW, YOU WERE
AT ONE WITH THE WATER.
THAT WAS AMAZING.

12:19.506 --> 12:20.507
I DID OKAY.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.075
OKAY ENOUGH TO WIN.

12:22.109 --> 12:24.244
YEAH, BUT I WAS OFF
MY PERSONAL TIME.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.213
SO, YOU WANT TO
GRAB SOMETHING TO EAT?

12:26.246 --> 12:29.049
I WOULD, BUT I PROMISED
MY MOM I'D HELP HER PACK.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.018
OKAY, HOW ABOUT
TOMORROW NIGHT?

12:31.051 --> 12:33.020
TOMORROW?

12:33.053 --> 12:35.989
YEAH. SOMETHING TO EAT,
MAYBE SEE A MOVIE.

12:38.325 --> 12:41.161
WHAT, YOU DON'T
LIKE MOVIES?

12:41.194 --> 12:43.263
NO, I EVEN LIKE
THE BLACK AND WHITE ONES.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.899
BUT I'M MOVING, SAMARA.

12:45.933 --> 12:50.203
I DON'T WANT TO START ANYTHING
THAT I CAN'T FINISH.

12:50.237 --> 12:54.007
OKAY, WELL, UM...
IT IS JUST A MOVIE,

12:54.041 --> 12:58.145
SO IF YOU DON'T A BIG
COMMITMENT, WE WON'T GET
THE LARGE POPCORN.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.412
( both laugh )

12:59.446 --> 13:01.849
OR AM I MISREADING THINGS?

13:01.882 --> 13:03.917
NO. YOU'RE NOT.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.789
LET'S DO TOMORROW.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.292
EXCUSE ME, EMILY.
YES?

13:12.325 --> 13:14.862
HI. COACH FULTON SAID
I COULD SAY HELLO.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.864
MY NAME'S KEN RAYMOND,
I'M OUT HERE FROM DANBY.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.899
DANBY U?
YEAH.

13:18.932 --> 13:21.001
WE LIKE TO CHECK IN
WITH THE TALENT THAT'S
GETTING READY FOR COLLEGE

13:21.034 --> 13:23.170
AND MAKE SURE THAT
THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT US.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.906
I DON'T KNOW A SWIMMER
WHO ISN'T THINKING
ABOUT DANBY.

13:25.939 --> 13:28.541
GOOD. WELL, I'D LIKE TO
TALK TO YOU ABOUT OUR PROGRAM.

13:28.575 --> 13:31.144
SO CALL ME.

13:31.178 --> 13:34.014
MAYBE WE CAN
SIT DOWN TOMORROW.
OKAY.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.383
GREAT.
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.424
SOMEBODY JUST
GOT SCOUTED.

13:44.457 --> 13:47.094
NO, HE...JUST
WANTS TO TALK.

13:47.127 --> 13:50.563
YEAH, FIRST A LITTLE TALK,
AND THEN A SCHOLARSHIP.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.309
YOU OKAY?

14:02.342 --> 14:05.512
I SHOULDN'T READ THAT.
THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING,
BUT THEY KEEP WRITING.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.916
YOU WANT TO SPLIT
ONE OF THESE?

14:08.949 --> 14:11.184
YES, I DO.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.254
( sighs )

14:16.256 --> 14:17.624
WHO ARE THESE FOR?

14:17.657 --> 14:20.327
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THEY'RE FOR ANYBODY?

14:20.360 --> 14:22.629
YOU'RE MOVING THEM
FROM THE BOX TO A PLATE

14:22.662 --> 14:25.365
SO YOU CAN PASS THEM OFF
AS HOMEMADE.

14:25.398 --> 14:28.468
DON'T WORRY.
I KNOW HOW TO KEEP A SECRET.

14:28.501 --> 14:32.405
UH, THEY'RE FOR
JASON DiLAURENTIS.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.274
WHY?

14:34.307 --> 14:36.243
WELL, HE'S BACK,
YOU KNOW?

14:36.276 --> 14:39.312
HE'S JUST DOWN THE LANE.
I THOUGHT I'D BE NEIGHBORLY.

14:41.614 --> 14:45.552
THEY WERE FRIENDS,
WEREN'T THEY?
JASON AND IAN?

14:45.585 --> 14:50.290
JASON...WASN'T SOMEBODY
YOU COULD DEPEND ON.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.325
DID IAN SAY THAT?

14:54.061 --> 14:56.463
I'M--JUST MAKING
CONVERSATION.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.298
THEN ASK ME ABOUT
THE WEATHER.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.567
OR THE DEFICIT.
OR GAS PRICES.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.603
YOU WANT TO HELP?
THEN DON'T ASK ME ABOUT IAN.

15:10.377 --> 15:12.946
Tom: DO YOU...

15:12.980 --> 15:15.348
UH...YOU LIKE
THIS THERAPIST?

15:15.382 --> 15:17.317
WOULD IT MAKE ANY
DIFFERENCE IF I DIDN'T?

15:17.350 --> 15:19.352
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

15:19.386 --> 15:22.489
I'VE ONLY TALKED TO HER
ON THE PHONE.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.958
SPENCER'S MOTHER
PUT THE WHOLE THING
TOGETHER.

15:24.992 --> 15:27.227
AND YOU'RE OKAY
WITH THAT?

15:27.260 --> 15:29.362
I DON'T THINK
IT'S DOING ANY HARM,

15:29.396 --> 15:32.132
AND RIGHT NOW
I DON'T HAVE A PLAN B.

15:32.165 --> 15:35.002
OKAY.
WELL, I HAVE A PLAN B--

15:35.035 --> 15:37.404
WHY DON'T WE JUST
TELL EVERYONE TO
MIND THEIR OWN BUSINESS?

15:37.437 --> 15:40.407
LET'S JUST PLAY THIS OUT
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.242
THESE ARE MY FRIENDS,

15:42.275 --> 15:45.012
THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE
IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW,

15:45.045 --> 15:47.014
AND THEY'RE TRYING
TO BREAK US APART.

15:47.047 --> 15:50.317
TELL HIM!
DON'T PUT YOUR MOTHER
ON THE SPOT LIKE THAT.

15:50.350 --> 15:54.121
HANNA, THIS IS NOT
A GOOD COP/BAD COP
SITUATION.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.056
WE'LL TAKE IT
A STEP AT A TIME,

15:56.089 --> 15:58.391
AND IF WE HAVE TO
MAKE ADJUSTMENTS
ALONG THE WAY,

15:58.425 --> 16:01.161
THEN WE CAN DO THAT.
YOU WANT US TO
EMAIL YOU ABOUT THAT?

16:01.194 --> 16:04.264
HOW ABOUT WE DO IT
FACE-TO-FACE?

16:04.297 --> 16:07.667
I THOUGHT
I'D STAY AROUND FOR
A COUPLE OF DAYS.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.039
CAN I GO NOW?

16:12.072 --> 16:13.440
YES.

16:15.308 --> 16:18.078
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU AGAIN, HANNA.

16:18.111 --> 16:22.282
( Hanna stomping )

16:22.315 --> 16:24.584
THAT SOUND
BRINGS BACK MEMORIES.

16:24.617 --> 16:28.788
WERE YOU PLANNING
TO STAY IN TOWN
BEFORE SHE SAID THAT?

16:28.821 --> 16:32.092
YES. YES, I WAS.

16:32.125 --> 16:36.229
IS THAT GONNA CAUSE
ANY PROBLEMS FOR YOU
WITH...OTHER PEOPLE?

16:36.263 --> 16:38.731
NOTHIN' I CAN'T HANDLE.

16:38.765 --> 16:41.468
WELL...

16:41.501 --> 16:43.103
THANKS FOR BACKING ME UP.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.638
I'M GONNA TAKE MY LEAD
FROM YOU ON THIS.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.740
I CAME HERE TO HELP.

16:47.774 --> 16:50.543
YOU WANT A GLASS OF WINE?

16:50.577 --> 16:53.580
UNLESS YOU WANT ME
TO MAKE YOU A MARTINI?

16:57.584 --> 17:00.320
I THINK WINE TONIGHT.

17:14.334 --> 17:17.436
HEY, EMILY, HAVE YOU BEEN
INTO YOUR DAD'S SIDE
OF THE GARAGE LATELY?

17:17.470 --> 17:19.739
THE LOCKERS? NO.

17:19.771 --> 17:21.473
BECAUSE ONE OF THEM WAS OPEN

17:21.508 --> 17:23.810
AND WE'RE MISSING
SOME WINTER GEAR,

17:23.843 --> 17:26.479
THE CAMP STOVE...
NO, I HAVEN'T BEEN IN THERE.

17:26.512 --> 17:30.250
JEAN WATSON SAID THAT
THEY HAD SOME STUFF MISSING
IN THEIR GARAGE AS WELL.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.219
SOMEBODY BROKE INTO
OUR GARAGE?

17:32.252 --> 17:34.621
DID THEY GET INTO THE HOUSE?
WAS ANYTHING ELSE MISSING?

17:34.654 --> 17:36.223
YOU KNOW WHAT, DON'T--
DON'T WORRY.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.824
I'LL CALL THE POLICE.

17:40.327 --> 17:43.763
AND DID YOU FORGET SOMETHING
AFTER SCHOOL?

17:49.802 --> 17:51.371
THANK YOU.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.282
( rings doorbell )

18:03.716 --> 18:06.819
( dog growling
in distance )

18:06.853 --> 18:09.556
HEY.
WHAT YOU DOIN', BUDDY?

18:09.589 --> 18:11.358
GET OUT OF HERE!

18:12.592 --> 18:14.194
( dog whimpering )

18:15.728 --> 18:17.664
HELLO, SPENCER.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.632
HI.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.701
SORRY. I SAW
THAT YOU WERE BACK,

18:21.734 --> 18:24.371
I THOUGHT I'D TRY TO
BEAT THE WELCOME WAGON.

18:24.404 --> 18:28.141
AH, THANKS.
THAT'S GREAT.

18:36.716 --> 18:39.719
ARE YOUR PARENTS
COMING BACK?
NO.

18:39.752 --> 18:43.756
IT'S JUST GONNA BE ME
FOR THE TIME BEING.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.428
I HEARD WHAT HAPPENED.
ARE YOU OKAY?

18:48.461 --> 18:50.663
I'M WORKING ON IT.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.634
SO YOU KNOW WHAT'S
BEEN GOING ON?

18:54.667 --> 18:56.436
JUST WHAT I GET
FROM THE NEWS.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.771
THE COPS IN THIS TOWN
DON'T REALLY TALK TO ME.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.873
I'M THE BROTHER
OF A MURDER VICTIM,

19:00.907 --> 19:04.377
BUT MOSTLY THEY SEE ME
AS A BIG PAIN IN THE ASS.

19:04.411 --> 19:06.279
I ASK TOO MANY QUESTIONS.

19:06.313 --> 19:10.250
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE BACK?
THE QUESTIONS?

19:11.951 --> 19:14.687
MAYBE I CAN HELP.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.556
OKAY.

19:17.790 --> 19:21.261
THE BELL TOWER.
WHAT ABOUT IT?

19:21.294 --> 19:23.763
I HEARD THAT
YOU TOLD THE POLICE

19:23.796 --> 19:26.666
THAT IAN CONFESSED
TO KILLING ALI.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.735
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?

19:31.271 --> 19:36.209
THAT'S BEING REFERRED TO
AS MY "VERSION" OF EVENTS.

19:36.243 --> 19:38.478
THE POLICE THINK
IAN RAN AWAY,

19:38.511 --> 19:42.249
BUT NOT BECAUSE
OF YOUR SISTER.

19:42.282 --> 19:44.617
DID HE CONFESS?

19:46.519 --> 19:48.921
YEAH, I THINK HE DID.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.592
YOU THINK HE DID?

19:52.625 --> 19:55.562
WELL, HE WANTED PEOPLE
TO BELIEVE THAT I KILLED HER.

19:55.595 --> 19:58.498
AND HOW DID YOU DO IT,
ACCORDING TO IAN?

19:58.531 --> 20:01.901
I PUSHED HER.
SHE FELL.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.704
AND IT WAS
AN ACCIDENT.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.773
JASON, I'M SORRY.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.975
I KNOW THAT YOU AND IAN
WERE ONCE CLOSE--

20:09.008 --> 20:12.445
DID HE SAY HE KILLED HER?
THAT'S WHAT HE MEANT.

20:12.479 --> 20:14.314
THAT'S WHAT HE MEANT,
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK---

20:14.347 --> 20:16.649
DID IAN SAY,
"I KILLED ALISON"?
NOT THOSE WORDS.

20:16.683 --> 20:19.519
NOT THOSE WORDS?
NO!

20:21.388 --> 20:23.823
IT'S GETTING LATE, AND...

20:23.856 --> 20:26.693
I'VE GOT A LOT TO DO INSIDE.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.628
CAN I HELP?

20:29.896 --> 20:32.965
YOU ALREADY HAVE.
GOOD NIGHT.

20:34.567 --> 20:38.004
GOOD NIGHT.
( door closes )

20:40.340 --> 20:43.343
Jason:
 ALISON! ALISON, HEY!

20:43.376 --> 20:44.911
DAMNIT, ALISON,
 COME HERE!

20:44.944 --> 20:47.514
COME HERE! HEY!
 STOP MESSIN' WITH MY STUFF!

20:47.547 --> 20:50.016
YOU AND THE POWERPUFF GIRLS
 JUST STAY OUT OF MY ROOM!

20:50.049 --> 20:52.419
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID
 I'D FIND IN THERE?

20:52.452 --> 20:54.287
LOOK, JUST STOP
 MESSIN' WITH PEOPLE.

20:54.321 --> 20:56.956
NO CHALLENGE WITH YOU
 AND YOUR LITTLE STONER BUDDIES.

20:56.989 --> 20:59.592
ALL YOU NEED IS
 SOMETHING SHINY
 ON A PIECE OF STRING.

20:59.626 --> 21:00.727
( girls snickering )

21:02.562 --> 21:04.331
WATCH HIM, LADIES.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.699
HE'S GOT TROUBLE
 WITH DOOR KNOBS.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.673
WHAT'S WRONG WITH JASON?

21:13.706 --> 21:17.677
HE JUST THINKS I STOLE
 ONE OF HIS JAPANESE
 CARTOON PORN BOOKS.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.679
DID YOU?
 OF COURSE I DID.

21:19.712 --> 21:22.315
AREN'T YOU AFRAID HE'S GONNA
 RIP APART YOUR ROOM?

21:22.349 --> 21:23.850
WOULDN'T DO HIM
 ANY GOOD.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.419
I HAVE HIDING PLACES
 ALL OVER THE HOUSE.

21:26.453 --> 21:27.854
IN THE YARD, TOO.

21:27.887 --> 21:31.090
WHEN I HIDE SOMETHING,
 IT STAYS HID...

21:31.123 --> 21:32.959
UNTIL I WANT IT FOUND.

21:32.992 --> 21:36.363
THAT'S WHY YOUR SECRETS
 ARE ALL SO SAFE WITH ME.

21:36.396 --> 21:39.466
( loud clatter
 from inside house )

22:03.122 --> 22:07.694
* EVEN WE, EVEN SO

22:07.727 --> 22:11.097
* HEY, HERE WE GO...

22:11.130 --> 22:13.600
Ken: EMILY,
 YOU'RE THE KIND OF STUDENT
 DANBY WOULD LOVE TO HAVE.

22:13.633 --> 22:16.769
YOU ALSO FIT THE PROFILE
FOR SCHOLARSHIP HELP.

22:16.803 --> 22:19.406
SO YOU THINK
I COULD GET
A SCHOLARSHIP?

22:19.439 --> 22:21.040
I THINK
YOU'RE IN GOOD SHAPE.

22:21.073 --> 22:23.643
BUT YOUR COACH SAID THAT
YOU WERE LEAVING THE DISTRICT.

22:23.676 --> 22:26.546
THAT WORRIES ME. I MEAN,
ROSEWOOD'S RATED SO HIGH,

22:26.579 --> 22:29.382
ANYWHERE ELSE YOU GO
IS GONNA BE A STEP DOWN.

22:29.416 --> 22:31.951
THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM.
DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE MOVING?

22:31.984 --> 22:33.753
THAT'S NOT DEFINITE.
OH, THE COACH SAID THAT--

22:33.786 --> 22:35.522
THERE WAS SOME TALK ABOUT IT,

22:35.555 --> 22:37.957
BUT I'M GONNA
FINISH SCHOOL HERE.

22:37.990 --> 22:40.693
GLAD TO HEAR IT.
CONTINUITY'S IMPORTANT
TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

22:40.727 --> 22:41.994
I KNOW.

22:44.063 --> 22:46.666
* ( male vocalist
 sings pop song ) *

23:31.944 --> 23:35.214
TOBY?
MR. SWEENEY LET ME GO.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.684
IT WAS YOUR FIRST DAY.

23:37.717 --> 23:39.986
THE OWNER OF THE HOUSE
SAW ME ON THE CREW

23:40.019 --> 23:42.822
AND TOLD MR. SWEENEY
THEY'D CANCEL THE JOB
IF HE DIDN'T GET RID OF ME.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.624
WHY?

23:44.657 --> 23:45.958
THEY'VE GOT A DAUGHTER.

23:45.992 --> 23:47.527
THEY DIDN'T WANT ME
IN THE HOUSE,

23:47.560 --> 23:50.530
SO MR. SWEENEY
PAID ME OFF FOR THE WEEK.

23:50.563 --> 23:53.500
HE CAN NOT DO THAT!
FORGET IT, SPENCER.

23:53.533 --> 23:56.002
IT'S JUST HOW
THIS TOWN WORKS.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.704
GET IN.

23:57.737 --> 24:00.640
TELL YOU WHAT, LET'S...
LET'S TALK LATER.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.649
THIS WAS YOUR IDEA.

24:09.682 --> 24:13.119
I KNOW. AND I PROMISE
I WILL BE THERE. BUT--

24:13.152 --> 24:15.655
THIS IS THE HEAD
OF THE DEPARTMENT.

24:15.688 --> 24:18.625
BUT YOU KNEW THAT
YOU HAD TO TALK TO HIM
WHEN YOU ASKED ME TO COME OVER.

24:18.658 --> 24:21.994
YES, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
THEY ONLY SPOKE IN PARAGRAPHS.

24:22.028 --> 24:25.998
LOOK, I WILL GET OUT OF HERE,
I WILL BE THERE, WE WILL TALK.

24:26.032 --> 24:28.067
( knocking )
ONE SECOND. SORRY.

24:29.602 --> 24:30.570
WAIT FOR ME.

24:30.603 --> 24:32.972
PLEASE.

24:33.005 --> 24:35.508
ARIA?
 OKAY.

24:35.542 --> 24:37.877
I'LL WAIT.

24:37.910 --> 24:39.946
BE THERE SOON.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.548
( exhales )

24:53.259 --> 24:55.094
Emily:
 MR. RAYMOND SAID

24:55.127 --> 24:57.096
I WAS THE KIND OF STUDENT
THEY WANT.

24:57.129 --> 25:00.199
I MEAN, HE JUST ABOUT
PROMISED ME A FULL SCHOLARSHIP.

25:00.232 --> 25:02.001
BUT HE SAID
HE COULDN'T DO IT
IF I MOVED,

25:02.034 --> 25:04.170
IF I ENDED UP AT ANOTHER SCHOOL
IN A DIFFERENT PROGRAM.

25:04.203 --> 25:07.540
IF I STAY HERE
AND GRADUATE FROM ROSEWOOD,

25:07.574 --> 25:10.109
I COULD HAVE
EVERYTHING I WANT AT DANBY.

25:10.142 --> 25:14.146
BUT IF WE MOVE,
IT'S ALL GONNA FALL APART.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.282
THIS IS A LOT
TO THINK ABOUT, EMILY.

25:16.315 --> 25:19.285
BUT YOU ARE
THINKING ABOUT IT?

25:19.318 --> 25:21.988
WELL, WE GOTTA
TALK TO YOUR DAD,

25:22.021 --> 25:26.158
BUT I THINK HE'D AGREE
THIS WOULD BE A REASON TO STAY.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.928
BUT...THIS FAMILY'S
NOT DOING ANYTHING

25:28.961 --> 25:31.864
BASED ON ONE CONVERSATION
WITH ONE SCOUT, OKAY?

25:31.898 --> 25:34.133
WE CAN'T JUST
DO THIS ON PROMISES.

25:34.166 --> 25:36.869
WE NEED SOME KIND
OF A COMMITMENT
FROM THE UNIVERSITY.

25:36.903 --> 25:41.007
NO PROBLEM.
I'LL TALK TO MR. RAYMOND.

25:41.040 --> 25:44.977
HOW DID IT GO WITH EZRA?
 OH, HE'S NOT HERE YET.

25:45.011 --> 25:47.013
HE'S AT HOLLIS,
STUCK IN A MEETING.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.948
HOW LONG HAVE
YOU BEEN WAITING?

25:48.981 --> 25:51.050
OVER AN HOUR.
( sighs )

25:51.083 --> 25:54.721
LOOK, THAT'S WHY
I WAS CALLING, SPENCE.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.956
HOW LONG SHOULD I WAIT?

25:56.989 --> 25:58.625
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME?

25:58.658 --> 26:01.360
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT
THIS GREAT INTERNAL CLOCK.

26:01.393 --> 26:05.364
LIKE YOU ALWAYS KNOW
 EXACTLY HOW LONG TO WAIT
 FOR A BOY TO CALL YOU,

26:05.397 --> 26:07.834
WHEN TO ASK YOUR PARENTS
FOR SOMETHING,

26:07.867 --> 26:10.703
HOW QUICKLY YOU SHOULD
MAKE UP WITH SOMEBODY...

26:10.737 --> 26:13.339
YOU ARE THE MASTER OF TIME.

26:13.372 --> 26:15.642
( knocking )

26:15.675 --> 26:18.010
UM, CAN I CALL YOU BACK
LATER?

26:18.044 --> 26:20.780
SURE.
SORRY. BYE.

26:23.149 --> 26:24.651
( sighs )

26:27.086 --> 26:28.755
HEY.

26:28.788 --> 26:31.157
CAN YOU GET OUT?

26:31.190 --> 26:33.292
UM...YEAH.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.127
LET ME JUST
GET MY COAT.

26:37.830 --> 26:40.032
* NOW YOU DO IT
 ON YOUR OWN *

26:40.066 --> 26:42.034
* BUT YOU FIND
 YOU'RE ALL ALONE *

26:42.068 --> 26:44.070
* WHAT CAN YOU DO

26:46.238 --> 26:50.042
* YOU AND ME

26:50.076 --> 26:52.979
* WALK ON, WALK ON,
 WALK ON *

26:53.012 --> 26:54.380
* 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T
 GO BACK NOW *

26:54.413 --> 26:56.348
( sighs angrily )

26:56.382 --> 26:58.050
( cell phone rings )

26:58.084 --> 27:00.219
* YOU KNOW
 THERE WILL BE DAYS *

27:00.252 --> 27:02.822
* WHEN YOU'RE SO TIRED THAT
 YOU CAN'T TAKE ANOTHER STEP *

27:02.855 --> 27:06.693
Voicemail:
 HEY, HANNA, IT'S MONA.

27:06.726 --> 27:09.696
I'VE BEEN TRYING
 YOUR PHONE A LOT.

27:09.729 --> 27:12.799
CALL ME. PLEASE, I MISS YOU.

27:12.832 --> 27:13.800
BYE.

27:13.833 --> 27:16.168
SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR PHONE?

27:16.202 --> 27:17.904
NO.

27:17.937 --> 27:19.171
YOU WANT SOME HELP
WITH THAT?

27:19.205 --> 27:20.940
NOPE.

27:20.973 --> 27:23.976
LOOK, I KNOW IT'S TOUGH
NOT SEEING YOUR FRIENDS.

27:24.010 --> 27:27.413
BUT IT'S A GOOD IDEA,
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

27:27.446 --> 27:30.917
DO YOU NOTICE HOW
I NEVER SEE YOU EXCEPT
WHEN I'M IN TROUBLE?

27:30.950 --> 27:33.986
DO YOU THINK
THAT'S SIGNIFICANT?

27:34.020 --> 27:37.123
I MEAN, SHOULD I
BRING IT UP IN THERAPY?

27:38.791 --> 27:40.392
I'M SORRY IT SEEMS THAT WAY.

27:40.426 --> 27:42.862
NO, DON'T APOLOGIZE,

27:42.895 --> 27:45.164
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T
MEAN ANYTHING.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.433
SO DON'T.

27:47.466 --> 27:49.969
IT DOES MEAN SOMETHING.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.705
MAYBE TO YOU,
BUT NOT TO ME.

27:55.942 --> 27:57.276
WHY NOT?

27:59.946 --> 28:01.914
WHEN YOU AND MOM
BROKE UP,

28:01.948 --> 28:04.016
YOU TOLD ME THAT

28:04.050 --> 28:06.786
EVEN THOUGH YOU WERE
GETTING A DIVORCE

28:06.819 --> 28:10.189
IT DIDN'T MEAN I WASN'T ALWAYS
GOING TO BE YOUR DAUGHTER..

28:13.092 --> 28:15.862
AND NOW...

28:15.895 --> 28:19.198
YOU'RE GETTING
A WHOLE NEW FAMILY.

28:19.231 --> 28:23.502
YOU LIED TO ME,
SO I DON'T TRUST YOU.

28:23.535 --> 28:28.174
NOBODY EVER MADE
A MISTAKE ON PURPOSE, HANNA.

28:28.207 --> 28:31.944
YOU ALWAYS THINK
YOU'RE DOING WHAT'S BEST...

28:31.978 --> 28:35.414
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT
YOU TELL YOURSELF
AFTER THE FACT.

28:35.447 --> 28:39.852
THE THING I CAN'T EXPLAIN,
THE THING I CAN'T FORGIVE,

28:39.886 --> 28:42.721
IS TALKING MYSELF
INTO LEAVING YOU BEHIND.

28:45.958 --> 28:47.827
IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH
DAMAGE CAN BE DONE

28:47.860 --> 28:49.996
WHEN YOU HAVE NOTHING
BUT GOOD INTENTIONS.

28:51.463 --> 28:54.233
* HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FEEL

28:54.266 --> 28:56.903
* YOU STRIKE AT
 MY ACHILLES HEEL *

28:56.936 --> 29:01.107
* WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG,
 I CAN'T REGRET *

29:01.140 --> 29:04.076
* IF I WAIT ANOTHER
 HUNDRED YEARS *

29:04.110 --> 29:06.779
* AND WHISPER
 AGAINST THE TEARS *

29:06.813 --> 29:10.950
* I'M NEVER GONNA BE
 THAT SHINY KNIGHT *

29:10.983 --> 29:13.953
* I FIND IT HARD

29:13.986 --> 29:16.288
* TO BE DOWN IN THIS HOLE

29:16.322 --> 29:21.060
* AND I FIND MYSELF
 TRYING TO MAKE A HARD CALL *

29:21.093 --> 29:24.030
* IF I CAN'T SAY IT

29:26.198 --> 29:30.002
* IF I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE

29:30.036 --> 29:32.404
* AND I NEVER WILL

29:36.542 --> 29:38.177
JUST SOMETHING IN WRITING,

29:38.210 --> 29:39.445
AND I WON'T HAVE TO MOVE.

29:39.478 --> 29:41.280
I CAN FINISH AT ROSEWOOD.

29:41.313 --> 29:43.282
AND YOU THINK YOU CAN
GET THAT FROM THE SCOUT?

29:43.315 --> 29:45.852
ABSOLUTELY.
THAT'S GREAT.

29:45.885 --> 29:47.553
IT'S BEYOND GREAT.

29:47.586 --> 29:49.788
I FEEL LIKE
I CAN BREATHE AGAIN.

29:54.193 --> 29:56.028
WHAT IS IT?

29:56.062 --> 29:58.297
YOU WENT SOMEWHERE
JUST NOW. WHAT WAS IT?

29:58.330 --> 30:01.033
NOTHING. I'M FINE.

30:01.067 --> 30:04.971
DID YOU COME HERE
WITH SOMEONE?

30:05.004 --> 30:06.572
MAYA.

30:06.605 --> 30:08.374
DO YOU WANT TO GO
SOMEPLACE ELSE?

30:08.407 --> 30:11.077
NO. NO, I'M FINE, REALLY.

30:11.110 --> 30:12.311
IF YOU'RE OKAY.

30:12.344 --> 30:14.046
I DON'T KNOW.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.548
GHOSTS OF FIRST GIRLFRIENDS
MAKE TOUGH COMPETITION.

30:19.085 --> 30:22.088
WHAT...SORT OF COMPETITION
WOULD I BE LOOKING AT?

30:22.121 --> 30:24.390
I MEAN,
FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT.

30:24.423 --> 30:27.994
WELL, I DON'T KISS AND TELL,
BUT I HAD A MAYA.

30:28.027 --> 30:29.929
EVERYBODY HAS A MAYA.

30:29.962 --> 30:31.497
IF THEY'RE LUCKY.

30:31.530 --> 30:34.333
WHO WAS SHE?

30:34.366 --> 30:37.003
HER NAME WAS
MARIANNE GINARI.

30:37.036 --> 30:38.404
SOPHOMORE ENGLISH,

30:38.437 --> 30:41.273
ONE ROW OVER,
TWO SEATS DOWN.

30:41.307 --> 30:43.876
SHE ALWAYS WORE HER HAIR UP,

30:43.910 --> 30:47.646
AND I KEPT LOOKING AT
THE BACK OF HER NECK.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.115
WHAT HAPPENED?

30:49.148 --> 30:51.918
WE HAD A STUDY DATE
ONE NIGHT,

30:51.951 --> 30:54.553
AND SHE LET HER HAIR DOWN.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.923
( movie starts )

31:10.202 --> 31:11.904
HI.

31:11.938 --> 31:13.139
HI.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.242
ARE YOU ALONE,

31:16.275 --> 31:18.310
OR IS NOEL KAHN LURKING
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE?

31:18.344 --> 31:21.180
ALL BY MY LONESOME.

31:21.213 --> 31:26.085
SO, ARE YOU GOING OUT WITH NOEL,
OR WAS THAT JUST A ONE-OFF?

31:26.118 --> 31:29.155
WELL, HE'S A MAJOR GET.

31:29.188 --> 31:32.224
NOW HE EVEN HAS
SOME BAD BOY CRED.

31:32.258 --> 31:36.162
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S BAD,
AND THEN THERE'S BAD.

31:36.195 --> 31:38.430
I WOULD JUST BE CAREFUL
AROUND HIM.

31:38.464 --> 31:41.700
SO, YOU WANT ME
TO BE CAREFUL?

31:41.733 --> 31:45.237
LIKE IT WOULD MAKE
A DIFFERENCE TO YOU?

31:47.106 --> 31:51.377
LOOK, I GUESS I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU DID WHAT YOU DID.

31:51.410 --> 31:54.346
YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT
YOU WERE DOING ME A FAVOR.

31:57.149 --> 31:59.018
REALLY, TRULY I DID.

31:59.051 --> 32:01.320
COULD WE JUST
FORGET ABOUT IT?

32:01.353 --> 32:03.522
OKAY.

32:05.191 --> 32:10.162
SO, DOES THIS MEAN THAT YOU,
LIKE, FORGIVE ME?

32:10.196 --> 32:14.033
YEAH...
I FORGIVE YOU.

32:15.134 --> 32:16.635
WOW.

32:16.668 --> 32:19.571
NO ONE'S EVER
FORGIVEN ME BEFORE.

32:19.605 --> 32:24.176
IT FEELS ALL, I DON'T KNOW,
SPIRITUAL OR SOMETHING.

32:25.344 --> 32:27.679
SIT WITH ME?

32:29.715 --> 32:32.751
SO, HAVE YOU, LIKE,
TALKED TO CALEB?

32:32.784 --> 32:36.422
YOU DON'T ASK ME ABOUT CALEB
AND I WON'T ASK YOU ABOUT NOEL.

32:36.455 --> 32:37.656
OKAY.

32:37.689 --> 32:39.391
Toby:
 WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

32:39.425 --> 32:41.660
I'M TELLING YOU NOW.
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME

32:41.693 --> 32:43.529
THE MINUTE YOU FOUND OUT
HE WAS TEXTING HER.

32:43.562 --> 32:45.364
WHY? WHAT COULD
YOU HAVE DONE?

32:45.397 --> 32:48.234
I'D HAVE DONE SOMETHING.
WHAT?

32:48.267 --> 32:49.735
I DON'T KNOW.

32:49.768 --> 32:52.738
WELL, WELCOME TO MY WORLD.

32:59.145 --> 33:02.281
IT'S NOT SO BAD
FROM UP HERE.

33:02.314 --> 33:05.017
JUST LOOKS LIKE A TOWN.

33:05.051 --> 33:08.120
THAT'S ALL IT IS.

33:08.154 --> 33:10.256
MORE THAN THAT.

33:10.289 --> 33:14.260
IT'S LIKE ONE OF THOSE
COLLECTIVE MIND CREATURES
IN THE MOVIES.

33:16.062 --> 33:18.630
ONE WITH A REALLY LONG MEMORY.

33:19.731 --> 33:22.801
IT'S NOT A MONSTER.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.237
IT'S GOT MONSTERS IN IT.

33:25.271 --> 33:29.241
YOU KNOW THAT.
SO DO I.

33:32.611 --> 33:35.447
I'LL DO WHAT YOU WANT ME TO.

33:35.481 --> 33:40.286
YOU WANT ME TO
TELL THE POLICE THAT
IAN'S BEEN TEXTING MELISSA?

33:40.319 --> 33:42.154
REMIND ME--

33:42.188 --> 33:46.358
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THE COPS
DID EITHER OF US ANY GOOD?

33:47.493 --> 33:49.228
SO?

33:49.261 --> 33:50.596
SO...

34:09.581 --> 34:10.748
SPENCE?

34:20.792 --> 34:22.393
SPENCE!

34:25.797 --> 34:27.565
SPENCER, ARE YOU HERE?

34:29.400 --> 34:31.069
SPENCER!

34:33.438 --> 34:34.572
AAAAH!

34:46.284 --> 34:48.687
EVERYTHING LOOKS ALL RIGHT
UPSTAIRS.

34:48.719 --> 34:51.322
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE OKAY?

34:51.357 --> 34:52.824
YEAH.

34:52.858 --> 34:55.393
MY DIGNITY
BROKE THE FALL.

34:56.495 --> 34:59.165
ARIA...

34:59.198 --> 35:01.567
HEY.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.802
ARE YOU SURE
THAT YOU'RE OKAY?

35:03.835 --> 35:07.406
YEAH. YEAH, I-I'M FINE.

35:07.439 --> 35:10.309
THE FACT THAT "A"
CAN JUST...

35:10.342 --> 35:13.445
BREAK INTO OUR HOUSES...

35:13.479 --> 35:15.581
SOMETIMES I THINK THAT'S
THE WORST PART OF THIS.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.817
EMILY SAID THAT SOMEBODY
BROKE INTO THEIR GARAGE

35:18.850 --> 35:21.353
AND STOLE
SOME CAMPING GEAR.

35:21.387 --> 35:23.789
AND HER MOM SAID THAT
THERE'S BEEN A WHOLE BUNCH
OF BREAK-INS AROUND TOWN.

35:23.822 --> 35:26.492
WHAT WOULD "A" WANT
WITH CAMPING GEAR?

35:26.525 --> 35:28.727
YOU TELL ME.

35:32.798 --> 35:35.467
WHAT IF IT'S NOT "A"?

35:35.501 --> 35:37.203
WHO ELSE WOULD IT BE?

35:37.236 --> 35:38.904
SOMEBODY WHO KNEW
WHAT WAS ON EMILY'S COMPUTER.

35:38.937 --> 35:41.773
SOMEBODY WHO NEEDS
CAMPING GEAR AND SURVIVAL STUFF,

35:41.807 --> 35:44.510
SOMEBODY WHO'S ON THE RUN.
IAN?

35:44.543 --> 35:46.245
WE THOUGH THAT "A"
WIPED EMILY'S HARD DRIVE

35:46.278 --> 35:48.314
BECAUSE THAT'S THE KIND OF THING
THAT "A" WOULD DO,

35:48.347 --> 35:51.250
BUT IAN IS THE ONLY OTHER PERSON
WHO WOULD WANT THOSE VIDEOS
DESTROYED.

35:51.283 --> 35:52.918
DO YOU THINK THAT
THAT WAS IAN UPSTAIRS?

35:52.951 --> 35:54.820
I DON'T KNOW.

35:54.853 --> 35:57.589
MELISSA'S OUT IN THE BARN.
WHAT WOULD HE WANT IN THE HOUSE?

35:59.258 --> 36:00.392
YOU?

36:03.262 --> 36:04.930
( tea kettle whistling )

36:07.799 --> 36:09.701
( thunder rumbles )

36:11.803 --> 36:13.305
THAT'S GREAT.

36:13.339 --> 36:14.806
MY MOM'S
REALLY EXCITED.

36:14.840 --> 36:18.277
SHE JUST WANTS A LETTER
TO SHOW MY DAD.
A LETTER.

36:18.310 --> 36:20.546
YOU KNOW, EXPLAINING
THE WHOLE OFFER.

36:20.579 --> 36:22.448
I'D BE HAPPY TO TALK TO
YOUR MOM AND DAD,

36:22.481 --> 36:23.949
BUT WE WERE DISCUSSING
WHAT COULD HAPPEN--

36:23.982 --> 36:25.984
I CAN'T OFFER YOU
ANYTHING IN WRITING.

36:26.017 --> 36:28.920
YOU SAID IF I KEPT UP
MY GRADES AND TIMES
AND GRADUATED ROSEWOOD

36:28.954 --> 36:31.357
I COULD GET INTO DANBY
ON A SCHOLARSHIP.

36:31.390 --> 36:32.758
YOU'RE A VERY STRONG
CONTENDER.

36:32.791 --> 36:34.626
I'D NEED MORE THAN THAT
FOR MY PARENTS.

36:34.660 --> 36:36.728
I NEED SOME SORT
OF COMMITMENT.

36:36.762 --> 36:39.365
I CAN WRITE DOWN SOMETHING
SAYING THAT WE'RE
INTERESTED IN YOU,

36:39.398 --> 36:41.267
BUT I CAN'T MAKE PROMISES.

36:41.300 --> 36:43.435
SO ALL I CAN GET
IS A "MAYBE" LETTER?

36:43.469 --> 36:46.838
THAT'S WHAT I CAN DO NOW.

36:46.872 --> 36:48.640
OKAY. THANK YOU.

36:48.674 --> 36:49.941
WE'LL TALK SOON.

37:00.386 --> 37:01.420
AW...

37:03.455 --> 37:04.790
THANK YOU.

37:04.823 --> 37:07.559
WASN'T EXPECTING THIS.

37:07.593 --> 37:11.430
TO BE HONEST, MOST OF
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME HERE
I DIDN'T...EXPECT.

37:11.463 --> 37:17.369
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO
CONNECT WITH YOU
THE WAY THAT I HAVE.

37:17.403 --> 37:21.907
I NEVER EXPECTED TO
FEEL THIS KIND OF LOSS
OVER LEAVING YOU.

37:21.940 --> 37:23.775
UM...

37:27.513 --> 37:29.481
STOP ME WHEN THIS
GETS TOO MAUDLIN,

37:29.515 --> 37:33.852
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO FORGET YOU.

37:33.885 --> 37:36.688
I WILL REMEMBER YOUR VOICES,

37:36.722 --> 37:40.359
YOUR QUESTIONS,
YOUR...FACES.

37:40.392 --> 37:42.761
I CHERISH THE TIME
THAT I'VE SPENT HERE,

37:42.794 --> 37:47.333
AND I'M MORE GRATEFUL THAN
I EVEN KNOW HOW TO SAY.

37:47.366 --> 37:50.836
THERE'S A QUOTE
BY JOSEPH CAMPBELL,

37:50.869 --> 37:52.771
AND IT GOES...

37:52.804 --> 37:56.508
"YOU MUST GIVE UP THE LIFE
YOU HAD PLANNED

37:56.542 --> 37:59.678
IN ORDER TO HAVE THE LIFE
THAT IS WAITING FOR YOU."

38:00.812 --> 38:02.914
I THOUGHT I KNEW
WHAT THAT MEANT.

38:02.948 --> 38:05.451
I DIDN'T.

38:05.484 --> 38:07.353
TILL I MET YOU.

38:07.386 --> 38:09.755
( bell rings )

38:09.788 --> 38:12.724
WELL, THERE IT IS.

38:12.758 --> 38:15.494
OH! OH. ALWAYS READ.
HAVE A GOOD LIFE.

38:15.527 --> 38:16.528
WE LOVE YOU,
MR. FITZ.

38:18.063 --> 38:19.698
GOOD LUCK.
THANKS, MR. FITZ.

38:22.534 --> 38:23.935
DORIS.
THANKS, MR. FITZ.

38:23.969 --> 38:27.806
* RUN US DOWN

38:33.044 --> 38:35.781
* RUN US DOWN

38:48.894 --> 38:51.563
* RUN US DOWN

38:57.969 --> 39:04.910
* AND ALL I WANT
 IS TO GET BETTER *

39:04.943 --> 39:11.783
* I SWEAR I'LL WORK
 TO MAKE IT BETTER *

39:11.817 --> 39:15.487
* SO PLEASE
 DON'T LEAVE CRYING *

39:19.791 --> 39:23.629
* SO PLEASE
 DON'T LEAVE CRYING *

39:27.699 --> 39:31.537
* OH, PLEASE
 DON'T LEAVE CRYING *

39:35.507 --> 39:36.842
EZRA.

39:39.611 --> 39:43.014
* PLEASE DON'T LEAVE CRYING

39:44.750 --> 39:47.686
* DON'T LEAVE

39:48.754 --> 39:50.556
* DON'T LEAVE

39:59.531 --> 40:03.101
* PLEASE DON'T LEAVE CRYING

40:12.978 --> 40:15.614
HEY. SORRY I'M LATE.

40:15.647 --> 40:17.148
DIDN'T NOTICE.

40:17.182 --> 40:18.650
YOU WANT SOMETHING TO EAT?

40:18.684 --> 40:19.785
I'M OKAY.

40:19.818 --> 40:21.186
DID YOU GET OUTSIDE TODAY?

40:21.219 --> 40:25.457
NOT IN THIS WEATHER.
I NEVER LEFT THE HOUSE.

40:50.048 --> 40:52.083
IT WAS IN THE POCKET
OF HER RAINCOAT.

40:52.117 --> 40:54.219
AND HER RAINCOAT WAS WET.
SO WERE HER BOOTS.

40:54.252 --> 40:55.954
SHE LIED TO YOU
ABOUT BEING OUT?

40:55.987 --> 40:57.856
WELL, SHE DIDN'T GO FAR.
I CHECKED THE DRIVEWAY

40:57.889 --> 41:00.626
AND IT WAS DRY UNDER HER CAR,
SO IT HADN'T BEEN MOVED ALL DAY.

41:00.659 --> 41:02.494
WHO WOULD SHE WANT
TO SHOW THIS TO?

41:02.528 --> 41:05.564
I CAN ONLY THINK OF ONE PERSON
WHO WOULD CARE.
IAN.

41:05.597 --> 41:08.667
IF SHE DIDN'T TAKE THE CAR,
THAT MEANS HE MUST BE CLOSE.

41:08.700 --> 41:12.604
YOU GUY'S HANNA'S RIGHT.
THIS IS THE WORST TIME
FOR US TO BE SPLITTING UP.

41:12.638 --> 41:16.174
WE HAVE GOT TO STAY TOGETHER.
YEAH, NO MATTER
HOW MUCH LYING IT TAKES.

41:22.914 --> 41:24.950
WHAT IS THAT?

41:27.085 --> 41:28.654
JASON?

41:28.687 --> 41:30.188
Jason: OH.

41:31.657 --> 41:32.991
IT'S YOU.

41:33.024 --> 41:35.694
YEAH, IT'S...ONLY US.

41:35.727 --> 41:38.664
UM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

41:38.697 --> 41:41.667
I'VE BEEN REPLANTING ALL DAY,
AND I'M PUTTING UP A FENCE.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.235
A FENCE? WHY? FOR WHAT?

41:44.269 --> 41:46.605
PRIVACY.
SECURITY.

41:46.638 --> 41:49.541
THERE'S A LOT
OF CURIOUS CREEPS
IN THE WORLD,

41:49.575 --> 41:54.079
AND ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,
PEOPLE ARE GONNA MIND
THEIR OWN BUSINESS.

41:54.112 --> 41:57.082
YOU GIRLS BETTER GO HOME.

42:06.758 --> 42:09.795
WHO'S HE TRYING TO KEEP OUT
WITH THAT FENCE?

42:09.828 --> 42:12.898
KEEP OUT OR...KEEP IN?

42:15.133 --> 42:16.868
( dog whimpering )

42:24.175 --> 42:26.144
( whistling )
