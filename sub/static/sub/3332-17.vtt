00:00.001 --> 00:04.370
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Okay, ready to roll? The</i>
<i>basics: Jane was artificially</i>

00:04.372 --> 00:06.271
<i>Inseminated</i>
<i>with rafael's sample,</i>

00:06.273 --> 00:08.273
<i>And from there,</i>
<i>a love story brewed</i>

00:08.275 --> 00:09.675
<i>And we even got a proposal!</i>

00:09.677 --> 00:11.276
<i>But jane said no,</i>

00:11.278 --> 00:13.212
<i>Which left rafael</i>
<i>pretty bummed.</i>

00:13.214 --> 00:15.614
<i>You know who was super psyched</i>
<i>she said no?</i>

00:15.616 --> 00:18.083
<i>Jane's ex-fiancÃ©, michael.</i>

00:18.085 --> 00:20.252
<i>Oh, by the way,</i>
<i>michael is a detective,</i>

00:20.254 --> 00:22.221
And when he took jane's father,
<i>rogelio,</i>

00:22.223 --> 00:24.289
<i>On a ride-along,</i>
<i>a bromance was born.</i>

00:24.291 --> 00:27.393
<i>And speaking of rogelio,</i>
<i>he and jane's mother had</i>

00:27.395 --> 00:29.094
<i>Gotten back together</i>
<i>and they decided to move in.</i>

00:29.096 --> 00:30.629
<i>But jane's grandmother</i>
<i>disapproved</i>

00:30.631 --> 00:33.098
<i>And so the women</i>
<i>were estranged.</i>

00:33.100 --> 00:34.266
<i>Oh, and jane had joined</i>

00:34.268 --> 00:35.300
<i>A romance writers' group</i>

00:35.302 --> 00:36.635
<i>And made a new friend, andie.</i>

00:36.637 --> 00:38.303
But zoinks! Turns out they have

00:38.305 --> 00:40.806
<i>Though jane</i>
<i>doesn't know that yet.</i>

00:40.808 --> 00:42.374
<i>Oh, and you remember</i>
<i>roman zazo?</i>

00:42.376 --> 00:43.709
<i>He was having an affair</i>

00:43.711 --> 00:45.310
<i>With petra, rafael's ex-wife,</i>

00:45.312 --> 00:47.112
<i>But alas, roman was impaled</i>

00:47.114 --> 00:49.314
<i>And now his twin brother aaron</i>
<i>is back in town</i>

00:49.316 --> 00:51.150
And is growing closer to petra.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.252
<i>Juicy stuff, folks.</i>

00:53.254 --> 00:55.554
<i>So let's see what happens next</i>
<i>with our star-crossed lovers.</i>

00:55.556 --> 00:57.456
<i>There are no hard</i>
<i>and fast rules</i>

00:57.458 --> 00:59.658
<i>When it comes</i>
<i>to becoming a parent.</i>

00:59.660 --> 01:01.827
(crying)
xiomara:
It's okay, jane, sweetie.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.328
Here.

01:08.668 --> 01:10.402
Latin lover narrator:
<i>There are, however, opinions.</i>

01:10.404 --> 01:12.638
<i>Lots and lots of opinions.</i>
<i>She needs it to sleep.</i>

01:15.575 --> 01:16.608
Back off. I'm her mother.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.211
<i>Ah, yes.</i>

01:19.213 --> 01:21.413
<i>The age-old struggle.</i>

01:21.415 --> 01:22.815
That doesn't
matter anymore.

01:22.817 --> 01:24.416
(baby jane coos)

01:24.418 --> 01:26.218
Jane:
<i>Pacifiers?</i>

01:26.220 --> 01:28.353
Not for now. Which is why
it's not on the list.

01:28.355 --> 01:29.855
Ah.
Stick to the list.

01:29.857 --> 01:32.291
Just tag what's on the list.
Uh, sorry!

01:32.293 --> 01:34.359
Hey, no, I'm sorry
that I can't be there

01:34.361 --> 01:36.228
To debate pacifiers in person.

01:36.230 --> 01:37.296
How's it going?

01:37.298 --> 01:39.431
Okay. I feel prepared.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.699
Did you take a look at the list?

01:40.701 --> 01:42.734
Uh, I didn't.

01:42.736 --> 01:45.571
I am sorry, but I am good
with everything that you picked.

01:45.573 --> 01:48.440
Okay.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.342
Hello. Cute, huh?

01:50.344 --> 01:51.577
Lina, take that off.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.846
I gotta go.
Okay. Love you.

01:53.848 --> 01:55.380
What is it for?

01:55.382 --> 01:57.583
You know, I'm not 100% sure.

01:57.585 --> 01:58.717
Pumping breast milk.

01:58.719 --> 02:01.253
Oh.
Sorry,
I overheard.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.222
I had mine six months ago.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.490
I remember being
totally lost

02:04.492 --> 02:05.858
When I was registering.

02:05.860 --> 02:07.459
No, no, I appreciate it.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.728
What is that, um... Thing

02:09.730 --> 02:11.330
That your baby's in?

02:11.332 --> 02:12.764
It's the wrap,
she loves the wrap.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.199
Are you going to wear your baby?

02:14.201 --> 02:15.601
Like an
accessory?

02:15.603 --> 02:17.202
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Is that legal?</i>

02:17.204 --> 02:18.637
I was going to get a carrier.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.205
This one's the best.

02:20.207 --> 02:21.473
Wearing baby
close to mommy's body

02:21.475 --> 02:23.142
Promotes a healthy attachment,

02:23.144 --> 02:24.610
Which leads to long-term
benefits in behavior,

02:24.612 --> 02:25.878
Intelligence,
self-esteem...

02:25.880 --> 02:27.412
Yes. Wow.

02:27.414 --> 02:28.647
I definitely want
all those things.

02:28.649 --> 02:29.882
But does it, like,

02:29.884 --> 02:31.350
Puke all
over you?

02:31.352 --> 02:32.484
Any other tips?

02:32.486 --> 02:33.886
Well... I guess
it kind of depends

02:33.888 --> 02:35.654
On your parenting philosophy.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.257
Is the baby going to sleep
in your room or in a nursery?

02:38.259 --> 02:39.358
Um, in a nursery.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.660
Okay, that's okay.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.395
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Doesn't sound okay.</i>
<i>Is it not?</i>

02:43.397 --> 02:45.831
It's a choice.
Everything's a choice.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.400
Uh-huh.
Are you planning on nursing?

02:48.402 --> 02:49.768
Yes. Definitely.

02:49.770 --> 02:52.504
Good.
It is the most important thing.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.706
Yeah, I did all the research.
I know all the health benefits.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.241
Did you sign up
for a lactation class?

02:56.243 --> 02:57.543
No.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.244
I didn't know that
they even had that.

02:59.246 --> 03:00.512
It's an absolute necessity.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.915
The lactation emporium
has the best ones.

03:02.917 --> 03:04.583
Are you working with a doula?

03:04.585 --> 03:06.919
No, I'm not.

03:06.921 --> 03:08.921
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Primarily because</i>
<i>she did not know what that was.</i>

03:08.923 --> 03:11.723
<i>But all that</i>
<i>was about to change.</i>

03:18.298 --> 03:19.598
Hey, so I just got the budget,

03:19.600 --> 03:21.800
And we did not agree
on this number.

03:21.802 --> 03:22.834
We have a lot of buzz coming off
the bisbal concert.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.803
We have to seize
that momentum.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.272
There's no reason why
we can't be a brand-name hotel,

03:27.274 --> 03:28.840
Like a fontainebleau
or a delano.

03:28.842 --> 03:31.944
We were making up
some deficits, rafael.

03:31.946 --> 03:33.445
Exactly.

03:33.447 --> 03:34.947
So now is the time
to reach a little.

03:34.949 --> 03:36.582
This party

03:36.584 --> 03:38.217
Is going to make the marbella

03:38.219 --> 03:39.751
A spring break destination.

03:40.987 --> 03:42.754
And you got
a special events permit?

03:42.756 --> 03:45.290
Applied for it two weeks ago.
Should be here any minute.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.760
Hey, come on.
Trust me.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.930
I got this.

03:56.502 --> 03:58.570
It's a baby wrap.
For baby-wearing.

04:06.879 --> 04:08.313
Seriously? How long are you guys

04:08.315 --> 04:09.781
Going to keep this up?

04:09.783 --> 04:11.450
Latin lover narrator:
<i>To recap: It has been one week</i>

04:11.452 --> 04:13.252
<i>Since xiomara</i>
<i>and alba last spoke.</i>

04:14.721 --> 04:17.856
You both said some
pretty hurtful things.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.660
And if she does, you'll move on?

04:28.468 --> 04:29.601
She's happy.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.869
In love...

04:33.039 --> 04:34.640
You know that's not true.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.942
Their connection
is not just physical.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.478
Latin lover narrator: <i>Well,</i>
<i>maybe not</i> just <i>physical...</i>

04:39.480 --> 04:41.913
But it definitely was <i>physical.</i>

04:41.915 --> 04:44.616
Michael:
So...

04:44.618 --> 04:46.652
I take it your answer
to my question is "yes."

04:46.654 --> 04:48.020
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And the question?</i>

04:49.756 --> 04:51.823
So, you two like
living together so far?

04:53.026 --> 04:54.293
It's amazing.

04:54.295 --> 04:55.761
You are amazing.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.296
No, you are.

04:57.298 --> 04:58.597
I know.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.037
The answer is yes.

05:05.039 --> 05:06.772
A thousand times yes.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.373
Happy to hear it!

05:08.375 --> 05:10.642
Anyway, here you go--

05:10.644 --> 05:12.511
Your "interstellar lieutenant"
badge.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.413
Thank you for dropping it off,
michael.

05:14.415 --> 05:15.714
The prop department
is all over me.

05:15.716 --> 05:18.684
Apparently these things
"take time to make."

05:18.686 --> 05:19.918
No worries.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.655
Oh, also... I brought you this.

05:23.657 --> 05:24.990
To commemorate
your time on the force.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.591
We usually give it to kids
on field trips,

05:26.593 --> 05:28.527
But...
I love it. Thank you.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.662
Hey, you know, jane's
actually on her way over...

05:30.664 --> 05:32.531
Jane:
Hey. Hi.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.533
I'm here.
We're here.

05:34.535 --> 05:35.701
Latin lover narrator:
<i>You thought it was awkward</i>
<i>when michael</i>

05:35.703 --> 05:37.069
<i>Stood there watching</i>

05:37.071 --> 05:39.571
I, I was actually
just on my way out.

05:39.573 --> 05:40.706
Just wanted to drop that off.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.441
I-I'll walk you out, brother.

05:45.044 --> 05:46.912
They went on
a ride-along.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.780
I had no idea
he'd be here.
I had no idea

05:48.782 --> 05:50.048
They were best friends.

05:50.050 --> 05:50.849
They're not.

05:52.919 --> 05:54.953
Why aren't you changed?
Go changed.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.822
It'll take me
two minutes.

05:56.824 --> 06:00.058
But can I just say
it seems silly

06:00.060 --> 06:02.527
To go to a breast-feeding class
before there's a baby?

06:02.529 --> 06:04.396
Then don't come.

06:04.398 --> 06:05.397
I'm coming.
I'm just saying,

06:05.399 --> 06:07.566
How is that a thing?

06:07.568 --> 06:08.834
You have no idea how many
"things" there are

06:08.836 --> 06:10.001
When you're having a baby.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.104
Hello, I have some idea.

06:12.106 --> 06:14.473
I mean nowadays.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.144
I wish you could come.
I know.

06:19.146 --> 06:22.414
But this party and the
budget we've sunk in...

06:22.416 --> 06:23.715
There's so
much to do.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.417
Less I can do at
a lactation class.

06:25.419 --> 06:26.685
No, I get it.

06:26.687 --> 06:27.953
(rogelio clears throat)

06:29.021 --> 06:30.122
Actually,

06:30.124 --> 06:31.556
You both should come,
you and xo.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.125
To the party.
Fine.

06:33.127 --> 06:35.093
I will provide
the celebrity presence.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.128
You don't have to keep hinting.

06:36.130 --> 06:38.430
I'm...

06:39.599 --> 06:41.733
...Eternally grateful.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.102
Good.
Want to take the grand tour?

06:44.104 --> 06:45.504
Follow me,
please.

06:49.442 --> 06:51.576
Your grandmother's going
to ask about the house.

06:51.578 --> 06:52.778
Don't tell her
anything.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.112
Ma.
Don't.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.114
Just mention how big it is.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.582
You have to
at least talk to her.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.850
Be the bigger person.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.185
And then what?

07:00.187 --> 07:02.120
Move back in with her?
I'm happy.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.855
I know.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.157
That's what I told her.

07:05.159 --> 07:06.525
That you're in love.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.461
Yeah.

07:09.463 --> 07:10.762
I really am.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.464
So who said it first,
by the way?

07:12.466 --> 07:13.765
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Interesting question, jane.</i>

07:13.767 --> 07:15.500
You know what?

07:15.502 --> 07:17.736
We haven't actually said it yet.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.604
Is that weird?

07:19.606 --> 07:21.139
That we live together,
but we haven't said I love you?

07:21.141 --> 07:23.742
Maybe slightly unconventional,

07:23.744 --> 07:25.477
But I'm not one to judge.

07:25.479 --> 07:27.512
Yeah, well, I'm not
going to dwell on it.

07:27.514 --> 07:29.481
Should I just go ahead
and say it?

07:29.483 --> 07:31.016
He shouldn't have to be
the first to say it

07:31.018 --> 07:32.484
Just 'cause he's
the guy, right?

07:32.486 --> 07:33.885
That's not, like,
feminist or whatever.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.187
Mom, shh.

07:35.189 --> 07:36.888
I'm trying to
listen to this.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.024
Sorry, sorry.
The cradle hold is
one that can be used

07:39.026 --> 07:40.158
Immediately after
baby's birth.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.493
Good job.

07:41.495 --> 07:42.828
And if you opt
for a hospital birth,

07:42.830 --> 07:44.062
Do not let those doctors

07:44.064 --> 07:45.163
Snatch that baby away

07:45.165 --> 07:46.698
Before you have
a chance to nurse.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.166
Snatch the baby away?

07:48.168 --> 07:50.569
Why would they snatch
the baby away?

07:50.571 --> 07:52.204
Just to weigh it
or give it a bath.

07:52.206 --> 07:54.539
Don't freak out,
this woman is a drama queen.

07:54.541 --> 07:56.041
...And this is the most
important thing to remember.

07:56.043 --> 07:57.242
Breastfeeding

07:57.244 --> 07:58.810
Isn't always easy.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.979
But if you decide
you will nurse, you will nurse.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.547
I had a new
mommy in here

08:02.549 --> 08:04.516
Just the other day,
and she was crying.

08:04.518 --> 08:05.817
She was painfully engorged,

08:05.819 --> 08:07.252
Her nipples
were so chafed,

08:07.254 --> 08:09.821
She was bleeding
and blistered.

08:09.823 --> 08:10.989
But she persevered.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.658
Bottle-feeding is not
the end of the world.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.227
Not the end of the world,
but it could be the end

08:15.229 --> 08:16.962
Of her baby's
proper immune function.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.930
You've got to
be kidding me.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.832
Mom, shh.
I'm just saying,

08:20.834 --> 08:22.968
I bottle-fed you
and you turned out great.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.669
Okay, well, it's 23 years later,

08:24.671 --> 08:25.937
And science says it's important.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.205
Now be quiet.
Okay.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.607
Let's see your cradle hold.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.543
Mm-hmm.

08:31.545 --> 08:32.944
Oh, and polly told me

08:32.946 --> 08:34.546
To ask you
for a doula recommendation?

08:34.548 --> 08:35.814
If we decided to go with one.

08:35.816 --> 08:37.682
When are you due?
June 1.

08:37.684 --> 08:40.085
Oh, dear, that's soon. The good
doulas are likely booked.

08:40.087 --> 08:42.020
All the good ones?
I'll have to dig around.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.255
Thank you.

08:43.257 --> 08:45.690
And are there other things
I should know?

08:45.692 --> 08:47.559
That I don't know I should know?

08:47.561 --> 08:49.127
Probably.
Which is why we have

08:49.129 --> 08:51.696
A wonderful online community
called the milky madres.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.565
Women who are going through
the same thing as you,

08:53.567 --> 08:55.567
Giving each other advice,
inside tips...

08:55.569 --> 08:57.302
Just lean forward a bit.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.770
Otherwise baby will
choke on the milk.

08:58.772 --> 08:59.838
We'll sign you up.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.706
Thank you.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.275
Jane...
Hmm?

09:03.277 --> 09:05.577
...Just don't panic.

09:05.579 --> 09:08.280
Latin lover narrator:
<i>But jane was,</i>
<i>indeed, panicking.</i>

09:08.282 --> 09:10.015
<i>And so she made a mistake</i>

09:10.017 --> 09:12.584
<i>We have all made</i>
<i>during moments of panic...</i>

09:12.586 --> 09:14.920
<i>She went down</i>
<i>the internet rabbit hole.</i>

09:14.922 --> 09:16.888
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>much of what jane found</i>

09:16.890 --> 09:18.123
<i>Seemed to be written</i>

09:18.125 --> 09:20.025
<i>In a secret code.</i>
<i>D.D.?</i>

09:20.027 --> 09:22.127
What's a d.D.?

09:22.129 --> 09:23.595
<i>Even more unfortunately,</i>
<i>the acronyms used</i>

09:23.597 --> 09:25.263
<i>In the online</i>
<i>parenting community</i>

09:25.265 --> 09:27.732
<i>Seem to number</i>
<i>in the thousands...</i>

09:27.734 --> 09:29.601
<i>As do the concerns</i>
<i>of the mothers online.</i>

09:29.603 --> 09:31.269
Mom: <i>My d.S. Got a pc</i>
<i>for his birthday.</i>

09:31.271 --> 09:33.305
<i>Should I be concerned</i>
<i>about adhd?</i>

09:33.307 --> 09:35.273
Mom 2:
<i>I'm scared that if I let</i>
<i>my baby cry herself to sleep,</i>

09:35.275 --> 09:37.075
<i>She will be traumatized.</i>
<i>What should I do?</i>

09:37.077 --> 09:39.277
Mom 3:
<i>I just read</i>
<i>about stress hormones</i>

09:39.279 --> 09:41.279
<i>In pregnant women</i>
<i>being terrible for baby,</i>

09:41.281 --> 09:43.281
<i>So now I'm stressed</i>
<i>about being stressed...</i>

09:43.283 --> 09:44.916
Girl:
Your stress hormones

09:44.918 --> 09:48.086
Are through the roof right now.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.822
Thanks to you,
I have anxiety problems.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.291
Who are you?
Your kid.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.060
You thought you were
prepared for this?

09:55.062 --> 09:56.628
Well, you thought wrong.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.229
You're a terrible mom.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.731
I hate you!
Oh!

10:04.203 --> 10:07.238
Latin lover narrator:
We all turn to different things
<i>in times of stress.</i>

10:07.240 --> 10:09.240
<i>Exercise.</i>
<i>A glass of wine.</i>

10:09.242 --> 10:10.875
<i>The</i> real housewives <i>franchise.</i>

10:10.877 --> 10:12.711
<i>For jane, it was studying.</i>

10:12.713 --> 10:14.779
(phone chimes)

10:21.721 --> 10:22.854
She's not here.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.322
Good.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.725
I've got a few more
boxes to pick up.

10:26.727 --> 10:27.726
Hello, jane.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.394
Hey, rogelio.
Dad.

10:29.396 --> 10:32.263
Hey, I wanted to talk to you,
actually, about michael.

10:32.265 --> 10:35.667
(laughs)
man, I love that guy!

10:35.669 --> 10:37.002
I know. I...

10:37.004 --> 10:38.737
You just need
to tone it down, okay?

10:38.739 --> 10:39.938
'cause it's uncomfortable.

10:39.940 --> 10:43.274
For me, for rafael.

10:43.276 --> 10:44.876
Who I'm having a baby with.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.945
I get what you're saying.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.013
Thanks.

10:49.915 --> 10:51.282
You okay?

10:51.284 --> 10:52.784
Yeah.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.419
It's nothing, I mean, I...

10:54.421 --> 10:57.155
I just like the guy.
Yeah, I get it.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.691
I mean, there's something,
you know? He-he-he gets me!

10:59.693 --> 11:01.760
He's funny, too...
Rogelio, please!

11:01.762 --> 11:04.162
Rogelio.
Look, I don't think it's good
for michael, either.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.797
You know? I mean, he...

11:05.799 --> 11:07.198
He needs to move on.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.434
Okay, I'll talk to him later.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.703
When we get mani-pedis.

11:11.705 --> 11:13.371
He agreed to mani-pedis?

11:13.373 --> 11:14.439
It was a surprise.

11:14.441 --> 11:15.440
Now?

11:15.442 --> 11:17.676
A parting gift.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.210
Can you take care of the boxes?
They're in my room.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.912
Yeah, sure.

11:22.715 --> 11:24.783
So...

11:24.785 --> 11:26.317
Did you drop the "l" bomb?

11:26.319 --> 11:27.719
No.

11:27.721 --> 11:29.187
I changed my mind.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.689
He should say it first.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.190
I suggested that
we move in together.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.425
It's his turn.

11:34.694 --> 11:35.960
So...

11:35.962 --> 11:37.462
I brought something to show you.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.864
Just to remind you that even
though I was only 16

11:39.866 --> 11:43.201
And mommy blogs and nursing
classes didn't exist...

11:43.203 --> 11:45.136
Mom.
I just don't want you

11:45.138 --> 11:48.740
To overthink this stuff.

11:50.142 --> 11:51.810
But I'm sleeping on my stomach.

11:51.812 --> 11:54.479
And the pacifier's probably
chock full of bpa.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.481
Plus there's
a blanket over me, mom.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.717
And there's a crib
bumper in there!

11:58.719 --> 12:01.820
Look, jane, all I'm saying
is, you turned out great.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.154
And-and you can read
all the books you want.

12:03.156 --> 12:04.956
But trust me,
with an actual baby,

12:04.958 --> 12:07.092
Everything's different.

12:07.094 --> 12:10.829
Aaron:
<i>My childhood wasn't great,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

12:10.831 --> 12:12.831
I mean, roman and I,
we were exposed

12:12.833 --> 12:14.899
To some tough stuff early on.

12:22.975 --> 12:26.845
Anyway, he went one way
and I went the other.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.847
Hmm. How'd you end up
in india?

12:28.849 --> 12:29.514
(both laugh)

12:29.516 --> 12:31.983
Uh, well, it started off

12:31.985 --> 12:34.753
As the usual post-college
soul searching.

12:34.755 --> 12:36.154
Mm.

12:36.156 --> 12:37.522
But the longer I stayed,

12:37.524 --> 12:39.324
I started to see
the world differently.

12:39.326 --> 12:42.527
Jainism isn't just
about nonviolence.

12:42.529 --> 12:45.530
It's about listening
to multiple views.

12:45.532 --> 12:48.933
It's about being
open and honest.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.468
Yeah.

12:50.470 --> 12:54.139
Well, well, I did
a-a little research actually.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.140
Did you?

12:55.142 --> 12:56.541
I was curious. Um...

12:56.543 --> 13:00.145
Do you mind
if I ask you a question?

13:00.147 --> 13:01.279
Mm-hmm.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.882
Are you a strict practitioner?

13:03.884 --> 13:05.350
In all areas?

13:05.352 --> 13:06.918
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It should be noted</i>

13:06.920 --> 13:09.821
<i>Petra was curious about</i>
<i>one area in particular.</i>

13:11.357 --> 13:12.791
No.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.559
Not in all areas.

13:14.561 --> 13:17.095
Oh.

13:17.097 --> 13:20.899
And, uh, which area
are-aren't you strict about?

13:20.901 --> 13:23.234
The one you're asking about.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.837
Or else I wouldn't be here.

13:36.582 --> 13:38.850
(phone buzzes)

13:39.585 --> 13:42.320
Rafael. I have to call him.

13:42.322 --> 13:46.191
So, what's it like
working with your ex-husband?

13:46.193 --> 13:48.193
Feels like a million years ago
that we were married.

13:48.195 --> 13:49.527
I'm over all that.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.264
Ah! Just put your feet in.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.933
Well, I, I feel silly.
Oh, come on.

13:54.935 --> 13:57.335
It's 2015.
Men get pedicures.

13:57.337 --> 14:01.005
Or what was all this
equal rights talk about?

14:01.007 --> 14:03.007
Thank you.
Anyway, speaking of women.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.009
Were we?
Why don't you come with me

14:05.011 --> 14:06.477
To the marbella party tomorrow

14:06.479 --> 14:07.879
And try to meet a few of them?

14:07.881 --> 14:09.848
Rogelio, what's going on?

14:09.850 --> 14:11.516
Listen.

14:11.518 --> 14:14.485
I know you still care
for jane very much.

14:14.487 --> 14:17.355
And between you and me,
I would like to declare myself

14:17.357 --> 14:19.524
#teammichael.

14:19.526 --> 14:23.394
But the first and foremost,
I must remain #teamjane.

14:23.396 --> 14:26.264
That means I must
encourage you

14:26.266 --> 14:29.634
To... #moveon.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.402
I've moved on.
Oh, have you?

14:31.404 --> 14:32.971
Well, I mean...

14:32.973 --> 14:35.173
I'm not dating anyone right now.

14:35.175 --> 14:37.408
But you are getting
busy... Knocking boots!

14:37.410 --> 14:39.577
Let's stop talking
about that immediately.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.980
Oh, come on! Just consider
coming out with me, please, bro.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.448
I mean, women will swarm.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.116
You will be lit by my glow.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.918
And perhaps, if you
get a girlfriend,

14:46.920 --> 14:48.920
That will make rafael
less uncomfortable...

14:48.922 --> 14:51.289
He's uncomfortable?

14:51.291 --> 14:54.192
You know, maybe I will come
with you to that party.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.995
No permit for the party?
I don't understand!
They said the city got

14:56.997 --> 15:00.031
Overwhelmed and our application
got lost in the shuffle.

15:00.033 --> 15:02.667
Okay, so expedite
a new application!

15:02.669 --> 15:04.202
We'll pay whatever fee...

15:04.204 --> 15:05.670
You don't think that
I tried that? They said no.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.005
So, what now?

15:07.007 --> 15:08.673
We go ahead as planned.

15:08.675 --> 15:11.676
We overextended ourselves
on all the deposits.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.912
So if we cancel now,
we're out the money

15:13.914 --> 15:14.679
With nothing to show for it.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.681
If we get caught...
We won't.

15:16.683 --> 15:19.350
You can't guarantee that!
Let's keep a low profile.

15:19.352 --> 15:22.153
Crowd control, no bonfires.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.222
Petra, I guarantee you

15:24.224 --> 15:26.324
That we are not the only
party happening tonight

15:26.326 --> 15:27.959
On south beach without
their ducks in a row.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.327
We're too far

15:29.329 --> 15:32.196
Down the road to back out now.

15:32.198 --> 15:34.032
So, have you talked
to your ex since calle ocho?

15:34.034 --> 15:37.068
No, but it was so weird
running into him like that.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.037
Latin lover narrator:
<i>You remember andie, right?</i>

15:39.039 --> 15:42.073
<i>Jane's new friend from her</i>
<i>romance writers' group.</i>

15:42.075 --> 15:45.977
<i>Turns out they have</i>
<i>a lot in common.</i>

15:45.979 --> 15:47.645
Okay, it sounds so silly.

15:47.647 --> 15:48.713
Mm-hmm.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.248
But I can't help but think,

15:50.250 --> 15:51.449
I don't know, that it's like...

15:51.451 --> 15:53.217
A sign?
(sighs)

15:53.219 --> 15:54.986
(laughs)
I get it, trust me.

15:54.988 --> 15:57.956
<i>Which is maybe why michael</i>
<i>dated both of them.</i>

15:57.958 --> 15:59.090
Just pour it into your writing.

15:59.092 --> 16:01.459
You're sharing next week, right?
Mm.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.961
I'm going to tell
amanda I can't.
Hmm?

16:02.963 --> 16:04.128
I just don't have the time.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.229
I promised my
sister I'd babysit.

16:05.231 --> 16:06.731
You're babysitting?

16:06.733 --> 16:08.733
A real baby?

16:08.735 --> 16:10.234
Um, yeah.

16:10.236 --> 16:12.136
I'll do it!

16:12.138 --> 16:13.204
I need the practice.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.340
Really? Are you sure?

16:15.342 --> 16:16.474
You'd be doing me a favor.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.076
I had no idea where I was gonna

16:18.078 --> 16:19.477
Get my hands on a real baby.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.745
That sounded weird.
Mm-hmm.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.747
But I'll take care of it.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.115
Her.
Her.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.351
Luna.

16:26.353 --> 16:27.352
That name is on my short list.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.754
See? Sign.
Aw.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.155
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And speaking of babies...</i>

16:31.157 --> 16:33.691
So, how do I look?

16:33.693 --> 16:35.093
Magnificent.

16:35.095 --> 16:37.762
My super fans can
eat their hearts out.

16:37.764 --> 16:40.765
I love making people jealous.

16:40.767 --> 16:43.534
Speaking of love, I was
unpacking and I-I found this.

16:43.536 --> 16:46.237
<i>Ah, a frame that says "love."</i>

16:46.239 --> 16:48.106
<i>Subtle, xiomara.</i>

16:48.108 --> 16:50.274
Do you like it or too cutesy?

16:50.276 --> 16:51.776
No. It's sweet.

16:51.778 --> 16:54.512
Maybe a picture of my mother?

16:54.514 --> 16:56.381
Another one?

16:56.383 --> 17:00.018
It should be noted that xiomara
<i>and rogelio's mother</i>

17:00.020 --> 17:02.653
<i>Met three times in 1991.</i>

17:02.655 --> 17:04.255
<i>All three times were</i>
<i>epic disasters.</i>

17:04.257 --> 17:05.790
So, you love the frame?

17:05.792 --> 17:07.125
Cool.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.693
What else do you love?

17:08.695 --> 17:10.328
Oh, are we playing a game?

17:12.398 --> 17:15.133
I'm just curious.
Hot chocolate!

17:15.135 --> 17:17.035
<i>Ah, so rogelio loves</i>
<i>hot chocolate.</i>

17:17.037 --> 17:19.037
With the mini-marshmallows.

17:19.039 --> 17:21.139
<i>With mini-marshmallows.</i>

17:21.141 --> 17:22.273
Got it.

17:22.275 --> 17:23.674
Anything else?

17:23.676 --> 17:26.144
Well, I love my fans, of course.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.478
The human kinds.

17:27.480 --> 17:31.149
And the ones that blow air.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.051
And mirrors!
I love mirrors...

17:33.053 --> 17:34.819
Enough!

17:34.821 --> 17:36.421
My turn.

17:36.423 --> 17:39.290
Hmm.
You know what I love?

17:39.292 --> 17:42.093
Sleeping on the left side
of the bed.

17:42.095 --> 17:44.829
But that's my side of the bed.
And you know
what else I don't love?

17:44.831 --> 17:48.099
I don't love the photos of
your mother around this house.

17:48.101 --> 17:49.734
Xiomara, that is very rude.

17:49.736 --> 17:53.337
As I mentioned before,
I love my mother very much.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.173
What is wrong with you?!

18:00.612 --> 18:03.181
Okay, I only have an hour
according to your assistant.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.715
You called rob?
Yup.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.317
And apparently,
you have a window.

18:06.319 --> 18:07.385
I do have a window.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.353
Good. Hey! Mm-mm!

18:09.355 --> 18:11.322
We have things to accomplish.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.591
Some things need to be decided.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.727
Let's do it.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.729
First, a doula.

18:18.731 --> 18:21.199
Should I have one?

18:21.201 --> 18:23.334
Um, refresh me
on what a doula is?

18:23.336 --> 18:24.735
You didn't read the e-mail?

18:24.737 --> 18:27.338
(sighs)

18:27.340 --> 18:28.806
She's there
to navigate the birth.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.541
She takes care of the mother
as far as I can tell.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.743
Like, pain management...

18:32.745 --> 18:34.245
Downside?
Expensive.

18:34.247 --> 18:37.215
Fine, it's no problem, I know.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.483
But it's a consideration.
Also there's another person

18:38.485 --> 18:40.885
In the room during the birth--
do you want that?

18:40.887 --> 18:42.820
Not really. Do you?

18:42.822 --> 18:45.656
I don't think so.

18:45.658 --> 18:48.292
Then why are we
even talking about it?

18:50.362 --> 18:53.764
Honestly?

18:53.766 --> 18:57.568
I just think I'm feeling
a little overwhelmed, you know?

18:57.570 --> 18:59.770
Hey.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.372
So...

19:01.374 --> 19:04.308
The thought of someone
in the room

19:04.310 --> 19:07.445
Who knows what's going on,
who's done this a lot is...

19:07.447 --> 19:09.780
(cell phone ringing)

19:09.782 --> 19:11.449
(groans)

19:11.451 --> 19:13.251
I am so sorry.

19:13.253 --> 19:14.285
Mm-hmm.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.287
It's-it's about the-the party.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.789
No, it's okay. I know.

19:18.791 --> 19:22.360
Please tell me this
is important, evan.

19:23.929 --> 19:25.863
No.

19:27.599 --> 19:29.333
Okay.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.668
All right.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.737
I'll handle it.

19:35.274 --> 19:36.774
Please don't kill me.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.242
I am sorry.

19:38.244 --> 19:39.911
Can't someone else handle it?

19:39.913 --> 19:42.446
They tried, they couldn't
and they called me.

19:44.917 --> 19:48.219
Hey, hey. Just... Come
back tonight, huh?

19:48.221 --> 19:49.754
After you babysit.

19:49.756 --> 19:52.423
Yeah, okay.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.292
Jane, look at me.

19:56.795 --> 19:59.297
We are in this together.

20:00.299 --> 20:02.433
And I love you.

20:04.636 --> 20:07.205
I love you, too.

20:13.245 --> 20:14.312
I come bearing babies.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.480
Or a baby. Luna.

20:22.287 --> 20:24.288
Oh.

20:24.290 --> 20:27.992
Is there anything sweeter
than a sleeping baby?

20:27.994 --> 20:30.328
So peaceful.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.597
â™ª

20:34.933 --> 20:36.534
Party's great, huh?

20:36.536 --> 20:39.503
Party's great.

20:42.674 --> 20:44.342
What the hell?

20:48.814 --> 20:51.515
Unbelievable.

20:55.020 --> 20:57.355
You see a girl you like?
Something better.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.890
I'm glad at least one of
us is having a good night.

20:59.892 --> 21:02.426
Hey, what's going on?
You okay?

21:02.428 --> 21:04.829
Xiomara's pissed at
me for no reason.

21:04.831 --> 21:06.597
Really?
Go back through it.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.566
Think of everything that
happened, anything you said...

21:08.568 --> 21:10.868
That's right,
you're a detective!

21:10.870 --> 21:12.603
You can help me
investigate what went wrong.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.705
Well, I don't know if
"investigate" is the right word.

21:14.707 --> 21:16.574
I will take you back
to the scene of the crime.

21:16.576 --> 21:17.975
Picture this:

21:17.977 --> 21:20.645
After a vigorous session
of lovemaking...

21:20.647 --> 21:22.446
Don't need to take me back
quite that far.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.482
Got it.
After lovemaking...

21:24.484 --> 21:27.885
Mm-hmm.
...We took a very
nice, long shower.

21:27.887 --> 21:30.054
No. Hmm-mm.

21:30.056 --> 21:32.323
Is she okay?
Easy.

21:32.325 --> 21:33.624
Still sleeping.
I need some action.

21:33.626 --> 21:34.892
How's it going in there?

21:34.894 --> 21:36.327
Oh, I got nothing.

21:36.329 --> 21:37.995
Really?
I heard so much typing...

21:37.997 --> 21:40.064
Oh, that was just me
internet-stalking the ex.

21:40.066 --> 21:41.499
You know,
instagram,

21:41.501 --> 21:42.900
Facebook, vine...

21:42.902 --> 21:44.669
I get it.
Should I text him?

21:44.671 --> 21:46.937
Maybe.
I mean, just to see.

21:46.939 --> 21:49.607
But I've worked so
hard to get over him.
Instagram,

21:49.609 --> 21:50.741
Facebook, vine...

21:50.743 --> 21:52.343
You know what?
I'll do it.

21:52.345 --> 21:53.611
Good. Yes.
I'll do it.

21:53.613 --> 21:56.480
(mock shudders)

21:56.482 --> 21:57.615
Okay, so...

21:57.617 --> 21:59.684
I'll just
say, like...

21:59.686 --> 22:02.353
Like... "hey."

22:02.355 --> 22:04.555
Okay.

22:04.557 --> 22:06.357
Hey...

22:06.359 --> 22:07.825
"hey."

22:07.827 --> 22:09.360
(laughs)
oh, come on,

22:09.362 --> 22:10.795
You're a way better writer
than me, let's go.

22:10.797 --> 22:13.431
Okay, let's see.
Um...

22:13.433 --> 22:14.632
"it was so good
running into you.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.033
"maybe we can grab some coffee

22:16.035 --> 22:17.068
Sometime and catch up."

22:17.070 --> 22:19.970
Dot dot dot.

22:19.972 --> 22:21.439
Maybe something else
will happen, too.

22:21.441 --> 22:24.809
Dot, dot, dot.

22:24.811 --> 22:26.510
Okay, send.

22:26.512 --> 22:29.046
(fussing)
okay. You wanted action.

22:29.048 --> 22:32.683
Oh.
Oh... Hi, luna.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.418
Oh, luna.

22:34.420 --> 22:35.686
Oh, it's okay.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.588
Oh, you're just all wet.

22:37.590 --> 22:38.823
We're gonna change your diaper.

22:38.825 --> 22:39.924
Here you go.

22:39.926 --> 22:42.093
Yeah.
What?

22:42.095 --> 22:44.061
No, no, no.

22:44.063 --> 22:45.963
How could I
forget diapers?

22:45.965 --> 22:47.431
Oh...

22:47.433 --> 22:49.667
Oh, my god. Um...

22:49.669 --> 22:51.836
I'll run out
and get some.

22:51.838 --> 22:53.838
Uh... Or I can stay
and give her her bottle.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.806
No, no, no.
You go, I'll be fine.

22:55.808 --> 22:57.875
I'll just get her
out of these wet clothes.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.877
(crying)
oh...

22:59.879 --> 23:01.011
Okay.

23:07.552 --> 23:08.886
Okay, okay.

23:08.888 --> 23:09.954
Okay.

23:09.956 --> 23:12.623
(crying loudly)

23:16.094 --> 23:18.562
Hey, uh, I know
abuela's at work.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.564
(crying continues)

23:20.566 --> 23:22.466
How's the
babysitting going?

23:22.468 --> 23:24.735
Not great!
What are you doing?

23:24.737 --> 23:26.837
Trying to figure out
this swaddle.
Just pick her up!

23:26.839 --> 23:29.974
No, mom, she needs
to be swaddled.
Honey...
The baby is crying.

23:29.976 --> 23:32.843
Yes, mom, I'm aware of that.
I didn't swaddle you...

23:32.845 --> 23:34.111
Don't you dare tell me
how great I turned out!

23:34.113 --> 23:35.146
I'm just trying to help you.

23:35.148 --> 23:36.847
Well, you're not helping!

23:36.849 --> 23:37.748
You're just doing
the opposite of helping!

23:37.750 --> 23:39.984
(luna fussing)

23:39.986 --> 23:42.720
(fussing stops)
oh, oh...

23:42.722 --> 23:44.789
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Oh, thank god!</i>

23:46.191 --> 23:47.925
Well, looks like
little miss perfect

23:47.927 --> 23:49.794
Has figured it out
all on her own.

23:49.796 --> 23:50.928
Good for you.

23:59.805 --> 24:01.038
(door slams)

24:01.040 --> 24:03.541
(crying loudly)

24:05.177 --> 24:07.611
Girl:
Worst.

24:07.613 --> 24:08.813
Mom.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.981
Ever.

24:16.555 --> 24:18.722
Peekaboo! (laughs)

24:18.724 --> 24:20.825
Latin lover narrator:
<i>You'll recall that when</i>
<i>we last saw jane and luna,</i>

24:20.827 --> 24:22.693
<i>Both were quite upset.</i>

24:22.695 --> 24:24.829
<i>But I'm happy to tell you</i>
<i>that things have improved.</i>

24:24.831 --> 24:26.730
<i>And it turns out</i>
<i>jane's got a knack for babies.</i>

24:26.732 --> 24:27.832
Peekaboo!

24:27.834 --> 24:30.701
(laughs)

24:30.703 --> 24:32.870
Peekaboo!

24:32.872 --> 24:33.971
<i>And she's actually having fun.</i>

24:33.973 --> 24:35.973
Peekaboo!

24:35.975 --> 24:38.042
<i>Perhaps it gets a bit</i>
<i>repetitive after awhile.</i>

24:38.044 --> 24:41.846
Are you sure
you don't want to do...
(cries)

24:41.848 --> 24:44.148
Peekaboo! (gasps)
<i>but really, how many times</i>

24:44.150 --> 24:46.183
<i>Can a baby want to hear</i>
<i>peekaboo anyway?</i>

24:48.987 --> 24:50.521
Peekaboo!

24:52.123 --> 24:53.591
(phone ringing)
is that the phone?

24:53.593 --> 24:55.860
(baby voice):
It's rafael!

24:55.862 --> 24:57.595
Rafael! Hello!

24:57.597 --> 24:59.597
Jane, are you okay?

24:59.599 --> 25:01.866
Yes. I'm just using
the baby voice

25:01.868 --> 25:03.868
So that the baby doesn't cry.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.069
How's it going?

25:05.071 --> 25:06.070
What?

25:06.072 --> 25:07.938
Jane, I said how's it going?

25:07.940 --> 25:09.206
Oh, it's great!

25:09.208 --> 25:12.276
What? Jane, I'm sorry,
I can't hear you.

25:12.278 --> 25:14.912
My grandmother is here,
and I can't hear a thing
that you're saying,

25:14.914 --> 25:16.647
So I'll be by later.

25:16.649 --> 25:18.582
Yes, yes, I'll see you later.

25:21.286 --> 25:23.020
It's going well.

25:23.022 --> 25:24.288
This is luna.

25:24.290 --> 25:25.689
That's abuela.

25:31.696 --> 25:33.531
(chuckles softly)

25:33.533 --> 25:35.132
(laughs)
ah?

25:40.539 --> 25:41.939
Yep.

25:41.941 --> 25:43.707
Mm.

25:49.047 --> 25:50.314
We got into a fight.

25:50.316 --> 25:51.982
I'm not in a forgiving mood.

25:51.984 --> 25:54.752
Ah.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.655
She was relentless.

25:57.657 --> 26:00.057
Telling me everything
I should be doing with the baby.

26:00.059 --> 26:03.060
Not to swaddle--
that she never swaddled me,

26:03.062 --> 26:04.562
And I turned out
just fine.

26:04.564 --> 26:07.331
â™ª
(continues
indistinctly)

26:07.333 --> 26:09.133
Back off.
I'm her mother.

26:10.068 --> 26:12.603
That doesn't
matter anymore.

26:23.114 --> 26:24.949
Bring me back to this game
that you and xo

26:24.951 --> 26:26.016
Were playing-- tell me about it.

26:26.018 --> 26:27.585
It was harmless.

26:27.587 --> 26:29.954
She was asking me
about things I liked...

26:29.956 --> 26:31.722
Or loved, I guess.

26:31.724 --> 26:32.723
Loved?

26:32.725 --> 26:33.891
Yes.

26:37.295 --> 26:39.830
I could crush some hunan wok.

26:39.832 --> 26:42.733
Or... Ooh!
Mansfield cafÃ©

26:42.735 --> 26:44.101
Is right near
their place, right?

26:44.103 --> 26:45.836
Or wait,
did deanna say

26:45.838 --> 26:47.738
That that was the place
that jacob hated?

26:47.740 --> 26:49.239
Doesn't jacob hate every place?

26:49.241 --> 26:52.109
What if we... Blew them off
and went to see a movie,

26:52.111 --> 26:54.845
Just the two of us--
is that terrible?

26:54.847 --> 26:56.180
I'd love to.

26:58.183 --> 26:59.883
(exhales)

26:59.885 --> 27:01.652
(gasps)

27:03.188 --> 27:05.889
(jane laughs)

27:05.891 --> 27:07.391
Mm...

27:08.860 --> 27:10.794
I love you, too.

27:11.796 --> 27:12.896
What?

27:12.898 --> 27:14.264
Nothing.

27:14.266 --> 27:16.000
We've just never...

27:16.002 --> 27:18.002
We've never said that
to each other.

27:18.004 --> 27:20.137
You just did.

27:21.339 --> 27:24.008
Actually, I said "I'd love to."

27:25.010 --> 27:26.744
O-oh.

27:26.746 --> 27:28.412
But... I do.

27:28.414 --> 27:30.147
I love you.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.181
Yeah?

27:31.183 --> 27:32.416
Of course I do.
I just...

27:32.418 --> 27:34.284
I-I... I thought
it was too soon.

27:34.286 --> 27:35.352
Too soon?!

27:35.354 --> 27:37.287
I've been waiting forever.

27:37.289 --> 27:38.656
You have?
Mm-hmm.

27:38.658 --> 27:39.890
Dropping hints all week.

27:39.892 --> 27:40.791
"what do you love about soccer,
ronaldo?"

27:45.764 --> 27:49.900
I'm pretty sure xo wants you
to say "I love you."

27:49.902 --> 27:51.769
(soft gasp)

27:51.771 --> 27:52.936
Of course.

27:52.938 --> 27:54.304
Yes, you are right!

27:54.306 --> 27:56.173
I don't know how
I missed it.

27:56.175 --> 27:57.908
Thank you.

27:57.910 --> 27:59.877
You are a true friend.

28:01.212 --> 28:03.981
So, can I ask you a question?

28:03.983 --> 28:05.182
Of course.

28:05.184 --> 28:07.051
Do you think they'll last?

28:07.053 --> 28:08.952
Jane and rafael?

28:08.954 --> 28:11.055
'cause I don't think
they will.

28:11.057 --> 28:12.990
Deep down, I-I don't.

28:12.992 --> 28:15.826
So, yeah, that's...
Why I haven't moved on.

28:15.828 --> 28:17.928
'cause I think
she's gonna wake up,

28:17.930 --> 28:20.230
She's gonna realize
he's wrong for her.

28:20.232 --> 28:23.067
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And even though</i>
<i>he wasn't sure at all,</i>

28:23.069 --> 28:25.836
<i>Rogelio knew what</i>
<i>his true friend needed to hear.</i>

28:25.838 --> 28:27.871
I think they will last,

28:27.873 --> 28:30.074
Michael.
And I think

28:30.076 --> 28:34.144
You need to #moveon.

28:36.815 --> 28:38.482
<i>Speaking of moving on...</i>

28:42.954 --> 28:44.021
See?

28:44.023 --> 28:46.023
I don't believe you.

28:46.025 --> 28:48.726
What?
That you're over rafael.

28:48.728 --> 28:51.895
Because I've been
watching you...

28:51.897 --> 28:54.064
And you've been
watching him.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.241
Excuse me for a minute.

29:04.243 --> 29:07.778
Man:
Found a whole bunch
of underage drinkers

29:07.780 --> 29:10.114
Out on your beach.
Oh. I am so sorry,
officer.

29:10.116 --> 29:12.015
It must have been fake ids.

29:12.017 --> 29:13.784
We try to be vigilant, but...

29:13.786 --> 29:15.519
We'll talk to our bartenders
right away.

29:15.521 --> 29:17.387
Pretty big party, though.

29:17.389 --> 29:19.022
You get the permits for this?

29:19.024 --> 29:21.258
We... We did send them in,

29:21.260 --> 29:24.061
But the office...
Misplaced them.

29:25.263 --> 29:26.897
You know, it is my understanding

29:26.899 --> 29:28.198
That you have the ability

29:28.200 --> 29:30.534
To overlook a mistake like this.

29:30.536 --> 29:33.003
Are you trying to bribe
a uniformed officer, mr. Solano?

29:33.005 --> 29:34.271
Oh, no...
'cause if you are,

29:34.273 --> 29:38.008
That would make a very bad
situation even worse.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.543
No. No, no, no.
Sir, I'm-I'm sorry.

29:39.545 --> 29:41.478
You know, we'll shut
the party down right now.

29:41.480 --> 29:42.880
Yeah, you will.

29:42.882 --> 29:44.014
Or trust me...

29:44.016 --> 29:46.083
That's the least
of your problems.

29:53.057 --> 29:55.058
Thank you again.
You were amazing.

29:55.060 --> 29:56.226
No. Of course.

29:56.228 --> 29:57.327
(phone ringing)

29:57.329 --> 29:59.096
It's him.

29:59.098 --> 30:01.031
Your ex?
Uh-huh.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.066
Go. Go outside-- I'll take
care of luna a little longer.

30:03.068 --> 30:05.169
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And I'll remind you now</i>

30:05.171 --> 30:06.904
<i>That andie and jane</i>
<i>share an ex.</i>

30:06.906 --> 30:08.038
Michael. Hi.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.573
<i>A fact jane did not know.</i>

30:09.575 --> 30:12.342
Hi. So, I just got
your text, and I...

30:12.344 --> 30:14.912
I thought, you know,
why not give you a call?

30:14.914 --> 30:16.046
I'm glad you did.

30:16.048 --> 30:17.915
How have you been?

30:17.917 --> 30:19.449
Oh, it's, it's been
a tough couple of months,

30:19.451 --> 30:20.517
To tell you the truth.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.252
Oh, I'm sorry.

30:22.254 --> 30:24.588
I heard you and jane broke up.

30:24.590 --> 30:27.391
<i>But andie, apparently,</i>
<i>did</i> <i>know.</i>

30:29.060 --> 30:31.128
(knocking)

30:34.098 --> 30:36.033
Can I come in?

30:39.070 --> 30:41.972
So, is it bad?

30:41.974 --> 30:44.107
We'll lose our liquor license.

30:44.109 --> 30:46.243
The question is, for how long?

30:46.245 --> 30:50.214
We'll lose weddings,
conventions.

30:51.883 --> 30:54.484
And it's my fault.

30:54.486 --> 30:57.221
Because I let my feelings
get in the way of business.

30:57.223 --> 30:59.256
(wry laugh)

30:59.258 --> 31:04.428
(laughs): I knew we
shouldn't go this big
without a permit.

31:06.130 --> 31:08.165
But I gave in.

31:09.634 --> 31:12.369
Because I'm not over him.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.438
Like you said.

31:18.176 --> 31:19.910
But I want to be.

31:19.912 --> 31:21.311
<i>There is a famous saying:</i>

31:21.313 --> 31:23.647
<i>If you can't be</i>
<i>with the one you love,</i>

31:23.649 --> 31:26.617
<i>Love the identical twin of</i>
<i>the guy you were cheating with.</i>

31:29.254 --> 31:31.388
(softly): Sorry.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.657
I'm sorry, I-I
shouldn't have...

31:33.659 --> 31:35.025
Come here tonight.

31:35.027 --> 31:36.460
I've had too
much to drink.

31:40.398 --> 31:42.132
(exhales)

31:42.134 --> 31:43.267
(door closes)

31:48.273 --> 31:50.474
So how was the party?

31:50.476 --> 31:53.210
Not good.

31:54.178 --> 31:55.279
Why? What happened?

31:55.281 --> 31:56.213
Whoa.

31:56.215 --> 31:58.682
We were shut down.

31:58.684 --> 32:01.184
Our liquor license
is going to be suspended.

32:01.186 --> 32:03.520
And we are facing
a huge fine.

32:04.489 --> 32:06.156
What?

32:06.158 --> 32:08.325
The cops came,

32:08.327 --> 32:12.329
And we didn't have the permits
that we needed for the party.

32:12.331 --> 32:14.164
Oh, no.

32:14.166 --> 32:15.165
Why not?

32:15.167 --> 32:16.633
'cause I screwed up.

32:18.169 --> 32:20.170
Sorry,
I was just asking.

32:20.172 --> 32:22.572
I really don't need any
judgment right now, okay?

32:24.175 --> 32:26.510
It's not what
I meant at all.

32:29.113 --> 32:31.114
Latin lover narrator: <i>Maybe</i>
<i>you should slow down, buddy.</i>

32:31.116 --> 32:33.116
Listen, I-I'm sorry
about tonight.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.319
We can talk
about the baby stuff tomorrow.

32:35.321 --> 32:37.988
Tomorrow I have to deal
with the liquor license, jane.

32:37.990 --> 32:40.624
Okay, so when can we?

32:40.626 --> 32:42.492
I don't know--
this stuff's time-sensitive.

32:42.494 --> 32:44.361
Yeah, and there's
a timeline here, too.

32:44.363 --> 32:46.196
Don't make me feel
guilty right now.

32:46.198 --> 32:48.332
I'm not.
Well, you're
clearly upset.

32:48.334 --> 32:50.133
Well, I'm allowed
to be upset.

32:50.135 --> 32:52.636
I-I shouldn't be judged for
working hard-- it's important.

32:52.638 --> 32:55.072
And so is our baby.

32:55.074 --> 32:57.207
Who I'm trying
to provide for.

32:57.209 --> 33:00.210
And I get that, but there are
other stuff, too, okay?

33:00.212 --> 33:01.611
I'm starting
to get really frustrated

33:01.613 --> 33:03.513
That I have to do
all of this on my own.

33:03.515 --> 33:06.383
Well, you know what I'm
frustrated about? Huh?

33:06.385 --> 33:09.219
Michael.
What does michael have
to do with this?

33:09.221 --> 33:10.554
Nothing.

33:10.556 --> 33:12.155
That's the point.

33:12.157 --> 33:14.291
He should have
nothing to do

33:14.293 --> 33:15.759
With our lives
right now,

33:15.761 --> 33:19.429
But yet here he is at my
party with your father.

33:19.431 --> 33:21.698
(scoffs)

33:21.700 --> 33:23.367
He's trying to get
you back, jane.

33:23.369 --> 33:27.004
And you are too naive
to even realize it.

33:27.006 --> 33:29.006
I'm not naive.

33:29.008 --> 33:30.240
But you're drunk.

33:30.242 --> 33:32.209
And I don't want
to be here anymore.

33:33.311 --> 33:34.611
(door slams)

33:41.152 --> 33:42.386
(groans)

33:42.388 --> 33:43.453
(cell phone chimes)

33:44.555 --> 33:46.223
(yawns)

33:50.194 --> 33:53.397
It's not good for children to
grow up with parents who fight.

33:53.399 --> 33:56.266
We tend to become aggressive.

33:56.268 --> 33:57.367
(grunts)
(moans)

34:11.582 --> 34:13.483
Rogelio:
Can we talk?

34:16.154 --> 34:19.689
Uh, mike helped me figure
out why you were mad.

34:19.691 --> 34:20.724
Who's mike?

34:20.726 --> 34:23.360
Michael cordero.

34:23.362 --> 34:26.296
Anyway, he thought you wanted
to know if I love you.

34:26.298 --> 34:28.665
Is he right?

34:31.702 --> 34:33.770
Yes.

34:35.373 --> 34:36.740
He's so smart.

34:36.742 --> 34:38.341
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Stay focused, rogelio.</i>

34:38.343 --> 34:40.377
(clears throat)

34:40.379 --> 34:43.780
Anyway, I feel silly I
didn't understand, xiomara.

34:43.782 --> 34:46.216
Though I wish
you'd just told me.

34:46.218 --> 34:47.851
Yeah, I know.

34:47.853 --> 34:51.121
I just got it in my head that
I wanted you to say it first.

34:52.790 --> 34:54.524
But what the hell?

34:57.395 --> 35:00.464
I do.

35:00.466 --> 35:02.466
I love you.

35:02.468 --> 35:05.402
And I...

35:05.404 --> 35:07.404
Am getting there
with you, as well.

35:07.406 --> 35:09.239
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Got to be honest--</i>

35:09.241 --> 35:10.574
<i>Not the answer</i>
<i>she was looking for.</i>

35:13.211 --> 35:16.379
And "getting there" was enough
for you to move in with me?

35:16.381 --> 35:18.381
To uproot
both our lives?

35:18.383 --> 35:20.383
Well, it seemed
sensible.

35:20.385 --> 35:22.385
I mean, you needed to get
out of your mother's house,

35:22.387 --> 35:24.421
And I needed to
make love to you

35:24.423 --> 35:26.223
Somewhere that didn't
feel like a convent.

35:26.225 --> 35:27.491
Unbelievable.

35:27.493 --> 35:29.259
No, no, don't
be angry.

35:29.261 --> 35:30.494
What I mean is
that, you know,

35:30.496 --> 35:32.529
I lived with
women before.

35:32.531 --> 35:33.897
Many women.

35:33.899 --> 35:35.499
Is this supposed
to be helping?

35:35.501 --> 35:37.367
No, I'm sorry, that
did not come out right.

35:37.369 --> 35:38.368
Please sit down.

35:38.370 --> 35:39.369
Please.

35:39.371 --> 35:41.171
(clears throat)

35:41.173 --> 35:42.806
What I mean is
that... (sighs)

35:42.808 --> 35:45.408
I-I've only said "I love you"
to three women in my life.

35:45.410 --> 35:47.377
You know, my two
ex-wives and my mother.

35:47.379 --> 35:49.679
Those words mean
a lot to me.

35:49.681 --> 35:52.415
And, if I'm honest,

35:52.417 --> 35:54.417
There is one thing
holding me back.

35:54.419 --> 35:56.386
What's that?

35:56.388 --> 36:00.357
The animosity that exists
between you and my mother.

36:01.392 --> 36:04.294
Her approval,
it means a lot.

36:04.296 --> 36:06.563
So I have invited her to visit.

36:06.565 --> 36:08.532
She arrives

36:08.534 --> 36:09.599
Next week,

36:09.601 --> 36:11.535
And you two can mend fences.

36:12.537 --> 36:13.937
Great.

36:13.939 --> 36:15.872
I can't wait.

36:17.842 --> 36:20.544
(chuckles)

36:22.947 --> 36:25.949
<i>And speaking</i>
<i>of mending fences...</i>

36:25.951 --> 36:27.817
Jane, about last night...

36:29.453 --> 36:31.454
I was drunk

36:31.456 --> 36:34.457
And pissed off and...

36:34.459 --> 36:36.459
I took it out on you.

36:36.461 --> 36:38.495
And I am so sorry.

36:38.497 --> 36:41.464
Everything that I said
came out wrong.

36:41.466 --> 36:43.300
It came out wrong,

36:43.302 --> 36:46.203
But you meant what you said,
right?
No.

36:46.205 --> 36:48.205
I was lashing out because I...

36:48.207 --> 36:50.440
Felt guilty, like you said.

36:50.442 --> 36:53.476
Like I was... Letting you down.

36:53.478 --> 36:55.245
Look, I-I understand
that you're mad,

36:55.247 --> 36:57.314
And you have every right to be.

36:57.316 --> 36:59.549
I'm not mad, rafael.

37:00.718 --> 37:03.453
I'm scared.

37:03.455 --> 37:06.456
When this baby comes,

37:06.458 --> 37:08.758
I'm scared
it's gonna all be on me,

37:08.760 --> 37:10.493
All the child care.

37:10.495 --> 37:11.728
No, it won't. We won't let it.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.597
What does that mean?

37:13.599 --> 37:15.498
Work is always gonna come up
for you.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.500
<i>It should be noted</i>
<i>that at this moment,</i>

37:17.502 --> 37:21.338
<i>All jane needed was for rafael</i>
<i>to say, "I'll pitch in."</i>

37:21.340 --> 37:23.940
So we'll get a nanny to help.

37:23.942 --> 37:26.743
That's your answer?
So that
you can do

37:26.745 --> 37:28.812
What you need to do,
and I can run the hotel.

37:28.814 --> 37:31.615
Will you be taking any time off
to take care of the baby?

37:31.617 --> 37:33.950
Come on. My job
is different.

37:33.952 --> 37:36.419
We have
different responsibilities.
So no?

37:36.421 --> 37:38.922
So I don't know. In
an ideal world, yes, of course.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.357
Come on.
You know how much

37:40.359 --> 37:41.625
This means to me.

37:41.627 --> 37:42.759
Jane, please,

37:42.761 --> 37:43.927
Let's not fight.

37:43.929 --> 37:45.629
I... Don't want to.

37:45.631 --> 37:46.896
Good.

37:46.898 --> 37:49.499
I promise you
we will figure it out.

37:49.501 --> 37:50.834
We will make this work.

37:52.503 --> 37:54.671
'cause I love you.

37:54.673 --> 37:56.506
Yeah.

37:56.508 --> 37:58.508
I love you, too.

37:58.510 --> 38:01.044
<i>But suddenly,</i>
<i>for the first time,</i>

38:01.046 --> 38:04.981
<i>She wasn't sure</i>
<i>that was enough.</i>

38:06.517 --> 38:08.985
(crickets chirping)

38:11.856 --> 38:14.591
Oh. I thought you
were at church.

38:15.526 --> 38:18.328
I came to see jane.

38:30.541 --> 38:32.342
(sighs)

38:35.846 --> 38:38.348
Seriously, ma, I am not
in the mood for a lecture.

39:06.711 --> 39:08.645
Thanks.

39:10.981 --> 39:13.850
(sniffles)
and the same goes for you, okay?

39:13.852 --> 39:15.118
What I do...

39:23.594 --> 39:24.661
Hey.

39:25.996 --> 39:27.464
What's happening here?

39:27.466 --> 39:28.665
(sniffles)

39:28.667 --> 39:30.700
Just working
things out.

39:31.736 --> 39:32.669
You okay?

39:32.671 --> 39:34.604
Eh.

39:35.806 --> 39:38.375
Look, I'm sorry
I snapped at you.

39:38.377 --> 39:40.610
No, I-I need to let you
do things your own way

39:40.612 --> 39:43.012
With the baby and not feel
like you think I'm a bad mom

39:43.014 --> 39:45.382
If you don't
take my advice.

39:45.384 --> 39:46.883
Mom, are you kidding?

39:46.885 --> 39:49.085
That's the last thing...

39:57.027 --> 39:59.629
What if I don't like it?

39:59.631 --> 40:01.030
The baby?

40:01.032 --> 40:02.766
All of it.

40:02.768 --> 40:04.768
Being a mom.

40:04.770 --> 40:07.771
I mean, babysitting
and playing peekaboo--

40:07.773 --> 40:10.840
It was one night, and I was
crawling out of my skin.

40:12.910 --> 40:15.712
That's what everybody says,
but what if it isn't?

40:15.714 --> 40:18.081
What if I can't handle it?

40:18.083 --> 40:22.652
And what if rafael is busy,
working all the time?

40:22.654 --> 40:26.723
Then we'll
pitch in.

40:26.725 --> 40:29.058
We're in
this together.

40:29.060 --> 40:30.860
All of us.

40:30.862 --> 40:32.996
Thanks.

40:36.066 --> 40:38.435
(sniffles, clears throat)
<i>excuse me.</i>

40:38.437 --> 40:39.969
<i>I seem to have something</i>
<i>in my eye.</i>

40:39.971 --> 40:42.472
<i>Just give me a moment.</i>

40:47.611 --> 40:51.047
Keep it up.

40:55.953 --> 40:57.554
Hey.

40:57.556 --> 40:59.155
Come in.

41:00.124 --> 41:02.559
Thank you so much for coming.

41:02.561 --> 41:03.893
I wasn't sure you would.

41:03.895 --> 41:06.162
Petra...
I just want...

41:06.164 --> 41:07.831
I-I...
(chuckles)

41:07.833 --> 41:09.966
I just wanted to
apologize for last night.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.768
I thought I was
ready for more,

41:11.770 --> 41:13.603
But I...

41:13.605 --> 41:16.139
Well, I guess
I'm just not there yet.

41:16.141 --> 41:18.708
Can we
just...

41:18.710 --> 41:20.043
Stick to friendship?

41:20.045 --> 41:22.512
Of course.

41:22.514 --> 41:25.682
Sorry. Thank you.

41:29.153 --> 41:31.754
We have a problem.

41:31.756 --> 41:33.256
A big problem.

41:33.258 --> 41:35.725
<i>Ah, yes. Let's rewind a bit.</i>

41:35.727 --> 41:37.760
<i>I'm sure you thought</i>
<i>petra was falling for aaron,</i>

41:37.762 --> 41:40.029
<i>But the truth</i>
<i>was a little more complicated.</i>

41:40.031 --> 41:41.731
<i>Remember that moment?</i>

41:41.733 --> 41:44.033
<i>See, it felt very familiar</i>
<i>to petra.</i>

41:44.035 --> 41:47.136
<i>And that kiss?</i>
<i>Also strangely familiar.</i>

41:47.138 --> 41:49.272
<i>And now... The clincher.</i>

41:49.274 --> 41:52.742
<i>You guessed it: Also familiar.</i>

41:52.744 --> 41:54.911
I don't know why,
I don't know how,

41:54.913 --> 41:57.080
But I do know that is not aaron.

41:58.215 --> 42:00.083
It's roman.
