WEBVTT

02:31.151 --> 02:32.778
Last night, in the hotel,

02:32.861 --> 02:37.282
I was-- I heard Good Ma
talking to Dandy Dave,

02:37.366 --> 02:40.953
and she said, "You're gonna be
supporting that useless son of a bitch

02:41.036 --> 02:43.455
-for the rest of your life!"
-What did Dad say?

02:44.206 --> 02:45.457
Said that the two of you were in love

02:45.541 --> 02:47.000
-and that was good enough for him.
-Okay.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.838
Good Ma thinks he's weird,
as well as useless.

02:51.547 --> 02:53.757
Scott and I talked. A lot.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.885
And you could say that
we speak the same language.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.349
Did you know he was a cutter too?

03:05.352 --> 03:06.478
Yeah.

03:07.354 --> 03:10.858
This is why loving him
isn't enough, Lisey.

03:10.941 --> 03:11.942
You're gonna have--

03:12.568 --> 03:16.613
Just, not-- Not for him. He's so fragile.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.240
You are gonna have to protect him

03:18.323 --> 03:20.617
and you are gonna have to keep him
connected to the world.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.286
You know, you just-- Do not--

03:22.911 --> 03:24.538
Do not let him leave it.

03:54.026 --> 03:56.236
Guys, it must be an adventure.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.616
Not everything is an adventure, Amanda!

04:03.535 --> 04:05.871
You know, guys,
I really have no idea where we're going.

04:05.954 --> 04:08.081
I know, ask Amanda.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.845
Look at the island!

04:24.306 --> 04:25.933
Okay, that's the sand dunes.

04:28.352 --> 04:30.812
-It's a little scary.
-We should go there!

04:32.314 --> 04:36.193
Darla, Lisey, get over here.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.945
Boyfriends and gold!

04:38.028 --> 04:40.906
Boyfriends and gold!
Boyfriends and gold!

04:40.989 --> 04:46.119
Boyfriends and gold! Boyfriends and gold!
Boyfriends and gold!

04:46.745 --> 04:47.829
Boyfriend.

04:50.499 --> 04:51.625
Gold.

05:05.264 --> 05:06.265
Hey.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.685
Amanda.

05:11.228 --> 05:12.437
Honey?

05:19.069 --> 05:20.195
Amanda, are you in there?

05:24.366 --> 05:26.368
It's me. It's Darla.

05:27.119 --> 05:31.331
Quiet, quiet. Be quiet. Come on,
I wanna watch the Hollyhocks.

05:32.416 --> 05:34.209
Where are you, honey? Is that where you--

05:34.293 --> 05:36.503
The long boy could hear us.

05:44.219 --> 05:45.429
Who's that?

05:56.565 --> 05:59.568
It's hun-- hungry. It's very hungry.

06:00.736 --> 06:02.988
-It's very hungry.
-Okay.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.824
It takes the bodies,
it keeps the souls. It's--

06:07.075 --> 06:08.285
Okay, honey.

06:09.995 --> 06:11.580
The-- The long...

06:11.663 --> 06:15.584
I'm a double. That's why you can see me.
That's why I'm still here.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.294
That's why. Yeah.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.058
-Hello?
-Hello.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.060
Is that you, Dashmiel?

07:15.143 --> 07:18.230
It is indeed. What a pleasant surprise,
Mrs. Landon.

07:18.772 --> 07:22.234
No, no, it's not gonna be pleasant.
It's not gonna be pleasant at all.

07:22.317 --> 07:26.864
I was gonna chalk it up to the usual
academic craziness and let it go.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.866
But that was before your friend called me.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.159
Oh, Mrs. Landon,
I don't know what you're talking about.

07:31.243 --> 07:32.244
Oh, you don't know?

07:32.327 --> 07:34.371
You don't know that your friend called
and threatened to hurt me

07:34.454 --> 07:37.791
unless I turned Scott's papers over to him
so he could give them to you?

07:37.875 --> 07:38.876
Miss Landon, I--

07:38.959 --> 07:41.044
You don't know
that he threatened to hurt me?

07:41.128 --> 07:44.882
Well, I didn't authorize--
Is his name Dooley?

07:46.216 --> 07:50.220
Well, he called himself Jim Dandy.
But I'm gonna assume that's an alias.

07:50.304 --> 07:52.681
I assure you, I told him I--

07:53.724 --> 07:56.894
He said-- I met him
at a bar near the campus.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.687
He said he was a big fan of your husband's

07:58.770 --> 08:01.231
and said he could persuade you
to give them up.

08:01.315 --> 08:05.736
The papers and unpublished fiction.
But I specifically said no violence.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.947
Did it occur to you that just having to
say that might've told you something?

08:09.031 --> 08:11.366
You know, I've dealt with
a lot of crazies since Scott died,

08:11.450 --> 08:13.285
and the academics
put the collectors to shame,

08:13.368 --> 08:14.786
but you really take the cake.

08:14.870 --> 08:16.955
Miss Landon,
if you'd just let me explain--

08:17.039 --> 08:20.667
Spare me. Just please spare me
the explanations. Just call your guy off.

08:20.751 --> 08:22.211
Now, I'm gonna go
to the local police again--

08:22.294 --> 08:23.962
Oh, no, no, no, please,
Miss Landon, don't do that.

08:24.046 --> 08:28.383
Now look, just take a breath
and let's just discuss this rational-like.

08:28.467 --> 08:32.304
I am gonna suggest to them that they
not contact the Tennessee State Police yet

08:32.386 --> 08:33.597
to have you arrested for harassment.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.767
But if I don't hear from you
that your guy is standing down...

08:36.850 --> 08:38.434
-Look, I--
-...then that's exactly what I'll do.

08:38.519 --> 08:43.315
He was just supposed to persuade you.
I specifically said no violence.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.234
Yeah, I don't think he heard you.

08:45.984 --> 08:50.197
So call him off. Or a police visit
will be the last of your problems.

08:56.078 --> 08:57.287
Fuck.

09:02.793 --> 09:03.794
We're sorry.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.671
You have reached a number
that has been disconnected--

09:05.754 --> 09:07.422
Are you kidding me? Sh--

09:27.526 --> 09:28.819
Professor Dashmiel.

09:30.821 --> 09:32.030
Mr. Dooley.

09:33.615 --> 09:35.117
You look just like your picture.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.161
-Do I?
-Same smart face.

09:40.163 --> 09:42.165
-Really?
-Really. Same smart face.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.755
Would you like some fried chicken?

09:50.883 --> 09:51.884
White meat.

09:53.635 --> 09:54.887
I beg your pardon.

09:54.970 --> 09:57.014
White meat is the best.
It's noncontentious.

09:58.390 --> 09:59.391
Really?

10:00.058 --> 10:03.061
Pork is the other white meat,
but I don't eat pork.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.856
Too much like human flesh.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.193
I read that someplace.

10:12.487 --> 10:14.865
Would you mind
if I record our conversation?

10:14.948 --> 10:16.783
"Everything is recorded."

10:20.871 --> 10:24.708
Battle Flags. Lieutenant Clark says
"Everything is recorded," remember?

10:26.084 --> 10:28.253
Right, yes, yes, right.

10:36.053 --> 10:37.346
To Scott Landon.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.265
May he never be forgotten.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.601
Amen.

10:43.894 --> 10:48.357
Your comments on Landon's fan site,
your insights, extraordinary.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.692
Especially for someone
who's not an academic.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.111
And yet you see Landon for what he was.

10:53.195 --> 10:55.989
What he still is, the greatest fiction
writer of all time.

10:56.073 --> 10:57.658
Taken from us too soon.

10:58.242 --> 10:59.243
Amen.

11:01.954 --> 11:06.250
I thought if I interviewed you, it would
add some texture to my forthcoming book.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.794
A certain feel
for what Scott Landon meant to--

11:08.877 --> 11:13.048
and I hope you don't find this offensive--
the common man.

11:15.801 --> 11:19.972
There's rumors he left behind a bunch
of material, stories and books and such.

11:20.055 --> 11:21.056
Any truth to that?

11:21.139 --> 11:23.559
Yes, I fear there is.

11:24.560 --> 11:28.146
His wife, she won't let them go.

11:32.526 --> 11:36.029
-Is that so?
-She has stonewalled my best efforts.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.743
We could do something about that.

11:46.164 --> 11:49.710
If you have any ideas, Mr. Dooley,
I'd be glad to hear 'em.

11:55.924 --> 11:57.134
You got a wife?

11:59.761 --> 12:01.096
I do.

12:03.015 --> 12:04.016
Be careful.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.779
-So she spoke to you?
-Didn't really make sense.

12:17.863 --> 12:20.699
She said she was a double
and that's why I could see her.

12:20.782 --> 12:23.911
And that she
wanted to watch the Hollyhocks?

12:23.994 --> 12:26.830
That I understood.
It's a game we played when we were kids.

12:26.914 --> 12:29.875
We used to pretend to be pirates.
Our ship was the Hollyhocks.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.794
We'd set sail from this big elm
in our backyard,

12:32.878 --> 12:34.254
searching for pirates and gold.

12:34.338 --> 12:35.881
I know how silly it sounds.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.967
Not at all.
That's how imagination develops.

12:39.051 --> 12:42.429
Do you think Amanda's reverted back
to childhood because Charlie dumped her?

12:43.096 --> 12:45.182
That she spoke at all is a good sign.

12:45.265 --> 12:49.895
What about the other thing
she talked about? This long boy.

12:50.521 --> 12:53.941
No clue. She looked scared.

12:56.652 --> 12:58.278
Lost and afraid.

12:59.988 --> 13:02.157
Scott used to look like that sometimes.

13:02.241 --> 13:04.910
She used to say,
"He's my brother from another mother."

13:04.993 --> 13:07.663
Well, did Scott ever talk to Amanda
about his childhood?

13:07.746 --> 13:12.084
Well, if the Hollyhocks came from hers,
maybe this long boy came from his.

13:12.167 --> 13:14.878
The only person Scott talked to
about his childhood was Lisey.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.171
And what does she say about it?

13:16.255 --> 13:17.965
She doesn't.
I don't wanna talk about Scott.

13:18.757 --> 13:19.758
Okay.

13:22.094 --> 13:24.805
But Scott and Amanda were close.

13:25.514 --> 13:29.977
Yes, they were close.
Not close like Scott and Lisey, but close.

13:33.647 --> 13:34.731
She may come back.

13:36.650 --> 13:40.237
Or she may sail away, on the Hollyhocks.

14:21.904 --> 14:22.988
Hi, campers.

15:36.186 --> 15:38.897
Lisey, I sold The Coaster's Daughter.

15:38.981 --> 15:43.485
I mean, the advance isn't much, it's just
$2,500, but it's gonna be published.

15:43.569 --> 15:47.573
We're going out to dinner.
No pizza. Real food, real wine.

15:47.656 --> 15:50.784
I sold it! I love you, honey.

16:14.391 --> 16:19.062
But once they're on
the attack, the spotted hyenas are rem--

16:23.984 --> 16:25.319
Hey, Scott.

16:25.402 --> 16:28.697
No, just your boring old sister.

16:28.780 --> 16:31.909
Oh, hey, Darl, what's up?
I'm just getting ready to go out.

16:31.992 --> 16:34.870
Oh, yeah? Young Hemingway
picking you up in his limo?

16:34.953 --> 16:38.999
No limo, but he sold his book.

16:39.082 --> 16:44.129
Oh, my God. Sold a book. That's amazing.
Amazing! How much did he get?

16:44.213 --> 16:46.715
$2,500. I mean, he says it's not much,

16:46.798 --> 16:49.635
but, my God, that's--
that's more than I make in three months.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.265
They must not think
it's gonna sell very well.

16:55.766 --> 16:57.142
Did you want something?

16:57.226 --> 16:59.645
Oh, yeah. Just to tell you
that you forgot Amanda's birthday.

16:59.728 --> 17:02.940
Yeah, yeah.
I know, and-- and-- and I told her,

17:03.023 --> 17:06.818
I-- I didn't trust my car as far
as Waterville, let alone Harlow.

17:06.902 --> 17:09.404
You think maybe one
of those "Sorry I'm late" cards--

17:09.488 --> 17:11.323
Do you think you can manage that?

17:12.031 --> 17:13.367
Well, she's not ten.

17:13.450 --> 17:15.827
Oh, my God. It's always about you.

17:15.911 --> 17:17.454
You know, you have a family,

17:17.538 --> 17:19.998
aside from this writer boyfriend
you are so besotted with.

17:20.082 --> 17:24.044
Would it kill you to spend a buck on
a damn Hallmark card for your sister?

17:24.127 --> 17:27.297
No, no, no, please, please. Don't-- Don't
start with me about this family stuff.

17:27.381 --> 17:30.300
-I gave up a scholarship to UMass...
-A partial scholarship.

17:30.384 --> 17:31.844
-A partial scholarship!
-...to take care of Good Ma...

17:31.927 --> 17:33.595
-because she had a stroke.
-And I did my part with Mom!

17:33.679 --> 17:36.723
Stop with that. Oh, oh, wait.
I think that's Scott. I gotta go.

17:36.807 --> 17:39.476
-Hey. No, no. Don't hang up on me. Lisey!
-Bye, bye, bye. Goodbye.

18:31.904 --> 18:35.032
Hey, Lisey. Sorry I'm late.

18:36.074 --> 18:37.159
I...

18:38.035 --> 18:42.539
I stopped by the English department
and I ran into Mort Tolliver.

18:43.290 --> 18:48.587
I, I told him the news, and he
strong-armed me for a couple of beers.

18:48.670 --> 18:50.047
Just a couple?

18:50.631 --> 18:52.549
Well, four or five.

18:54.259 --> 18:57.638
We got to talking.
I kinda lost track of time.

19:00.557 --> 19:01.934
I-- I'm really sorry.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.771
But we'll do dinner tomorrow night.

19:08.148 --> 19:09.149
Did you eat?

19:09.233 --> 19:11.527
No, 'cause I was waiting for you.

19:13.153 --> 19:18.534
And in the meantime, I got treated
to a guilt trip from my sister, Darla.

19:19.117 --> 19:23.038
And I watched a hyena eat a gopher on TV.

19:23.622 --> 19:25.123
That looked pretty tough.

19:26.792 --> 19:28.335
Oh, God, you smell.

19:28.961 --> 19:30.420
Oh, come on.
I-I'll take you out for a burger.

19:30.504 --> 19:32.130
No, do-- do you not get it?

19:32.214 --> 19:36.844
I spent the whole day on my feet, followed
by a night in this shitty apartment

19:36.927 --> 19:40.055
while you celebrated your news
with someone I don't know.

19:40.138 --> 19:43.058
Don't do that! I hate it
when you fucking bite your nails!

19:43.141 --> 19:45.352
You look like a rat
chewing a piece of cheese.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.939
Just-- Clean yourself up
and sleep on the couch,

19:49.022 --> 19:51.191
'cause I don't need this.

19:52.150 --> 19:56.113
I don't need a creative drunk in my life,
because I have enough problems as it is.

20:02.619 --> 20:03.620
Wait.

20:05.789 --> 20:07.040
Wait for what?

20:08.292 --> 20:11.211
Two minutes. I can fix this.

20:15.632 --> 20:19.344
Oh. Look,
I'm happy you sold your book. And...

20:21.221 --> 20:24.808
I'm glad you got home without getting
into an accident or-- or getting arrested.

20:24.892 --> 20:27.060
Look, I'm just mad, I'm just mad!

20:27.144 --> 20:28.478
Two minutes.

20:44.828 --> 20:49.333
Long as I got my plastic Jesus

20:49.416 --> 20:51.502
Jesus Christ. I hear people take...

20:51.585 --> 20:57.424
Sitting on the dashboard of my car

20:58.133 --> 21:03.138
I could go a hundred miles per hour

21:04.515 --> 21:10.187
Long as I got the almighty power

21:10.270 --> 21:12.356
The devil delights
in the sins of the flesh

21:12.439 --> 21:14.066
the way pig delights in the wallow!

21:14.149 --> 21:16.235
-Can I get a hallelujah?
-Hallelujah!

21:16.318 --> 21:18.070
-Can I get an amen?
-Amen!

21:18.153 --> 21:19.446
Thank you.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.326
Scott!

21:30.958 --> 21:34.211
What is that place?
Some place you can hide?

21:36.088 --> 21:37.381
I know you're gonna leave me.

21:38.423 --> 21:41.468
I made you boys.
I made you what you are.

21:41.552 --> 21:45.055
...your entire body, but for all eternity.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.348
I love you.

21:46.431 --> 21:47.808
Let me go!

21:48.767 --> 21:52.729
But the devil says,
"No! Not now. Not in a thousand years.

21:52.813 --> 21:54.398
Not in a million years. Not ever."

21:54.481 --> 21:56.900
You are burning, brothers and sisters,

21:56.984 --> 21:59.278
and you could be walking
the halls of heaven

21:59.361 --> 22:01.446
hand in hand with Jesus Christ.

22:01.530 --> 22:02.614
Can I get a hallelujah?

22:02.698 --> 22:04.116
Hallelujah!

22:04.199 --> 22:05.701
Scooter.

22:05.784 --> 22:08.620
Ask Jesus into your heart.
That's all you need to do.

22:08.704 --> 22:10.497
Fucking look at me!

22:12.165 --> 22:14.168
You're just like your mother.

22:14.251 --> 22:17.379
Go to Booya Moon
or whatever that is you call it.

22:23.635 --> 22:26.013
They just don't shut up.
They just don't shut up.

22:26.096 --> 22:28.599
They just don't shut up.
They never stop.

22:28.682 --> 22:29.933
You think I like it?

22:30.017 --> 22:31.935
I don't like it,
I don't like it, I don't like it.

22:50.037 --> 22:52.372
No, no, no!

22:52.456 --> 22:55.459
No, no! God, no!

23:01.256 --> 23:02.674
My brave boy.

23:03.550 --> 23:05.969
My brave, brave, brave boy.

23:22.903 --> 23:24.112
I fixed it.

23:26.740 --> 23:27.950
It's okay now.

23:32.704 --> 23:34.373
It's for you, Lisey.

23:37.334 --> 23:39.837
To say I'm sorry I forgot.

23:42.631 --> 23:46.385
And it won't happen again.

24:00.023 --> 24:03.569
It's a blood-bool. These are special.

24:05.529 --> 24:09.533
They're mostly for letting out the bad
but also for sorry. Will you take it?

24:10.701 --> 24:13.453
Because if you take a bool,
especially a blood-bool,

24:13.537 --> 24:15.038
then-- then sorry's okay.

24:15.122 --> 24:17.040
-Please take it.
-Okay, okay, I'll take it.

24:17.124 --> 24:20.335
I don't-- I don't understand
what you're talking about.

24:23.213 --> 24:26.925
I wouldn't have been able to eat anyway.
Darla took my appetite.

24:27.509 --> 24:30.762
I get it. Families suck.

24:30.846 --> 24:32.222
Yeah, they do.

24:33.182 --> 24:37.019
Sometimes I suck. Just ask my family.

24:37.102 --> 24:40.981
Well, you don't suck to me.
You never will.

24:42.441 --> 24:44.193
You're my heart, kiddo.

24:45.569 --> 24:46.778
And listen.

24:47.696 --> 24:51.241
This is our time now. You and me.

24:51.325 --> 24:52.367
Okay.

24:53.410 --> 24:56.163
Okay. Look, you're--
you're gonna need stitches,

24:56.246 --> 24:57.873
so we're gonna have to go to the ER,

24:57.956 --> 25:02.127
and if you're worried about what they
might say, you can just make up a story.

25:02.211 --> 25:04.213
That's what you do, right?
You make up stories.

25:04.296 --> 25:08.425
No. No, because the bleeding's
almost stopped already.

25:10.761 --> 25:13.555
And besides, all Landons are fast healers.

25:15.474 --> 25:16.558
We had to be.

25:18.519 --> 25:19.811
Should have seen Paul.

25:20.562 --> 25:24.900
Paul's-- Paul's your brother, right?
Where-- Where does Paul live?

25:24.983 --> 25:26.068
Paul's dead.

25:28.153 --> 25:29.154
Long time.

25:32.324 --> 25:36.203
Okay. Let's go to the ER now.

25:40.832 --> 25:42.292
Oh, no, no, no, don't do that!
Don't, don't--

25:42.376 --> 25:44.711
I have to make sure
it's clean before I go.

25:45.879 --> 25:50.551
You know, Coaster's Daughter
might not sell a lot of copies,

25:50.634 --> 25:53.011
but the one I'm working on now
is a firecracker.

25:53.095 --> 25:55.264
It's best-seller stuff.
Do you believe that?

25:55.848 --> 25:58.141
Yeah. Actually, I do.

25:58.225 --> 26:02.646
-Good. Cigarette me, babyluv.
-No, no.

26:02.729 --> 26:05.357
You shouldn't be smoking
with your arm-- arm like that.

26:05.440 --> 26:06.900
No, it's fine. It's fine.

26:10.028 --> 26:11.029
Okay.

26:17.661 --> 26:19.454
They're hard memories.

26:20.998 --> 26:22.332
Are you crazy?

26:24.334 --> 26:26.503
Am I living with a crazy person?

26:28.922 --> 26:30.048
Lisey.

26:32.384 --> 26:34.720
We can't go on living like this.

26:35.387 --> 26:36.555
Why?

26:38.390 --> 26:39.850
We ought to get married.

26:42.102 --> 26:47.900
If-- If my book sells like I think it
will, we should buy a new house.

26:52.613 --> 26:54.781
-Lisey?
-Yeah, I'm thinking.

26:56.533 --> 26:57.534
I love you.

26:57.618 --> 27:01.705
Oh, I love you too. I love you.

27:03.207 --> 27:04.666
That's not the point.

27:05.459 --> 27:06.585
It might be.

27:08.420 --> 27:11.381
See, nobody's ever loved me since Paul.

27:13.467 --> 27:15.594
And Daddy, I guess.

27:16.845 --> 27:18.847
A lot of people are gonna love you.

27:19.973 --> 27:21.683
You are so talented.

27:23.477 --> 27:25.479
You're gonna be so successful.

27:27.147 --> 27:29.983
The issue is whether or not
you'll still love me.

27:32.069 --> 27:36.073
Yeah, but you care about my stories,
but you also care if I brush my teeth

27:36.156 --> 27:39.326
or if I bite my fingernails

27:39.409 --> 27:42.871
like a rat chewing
on a piece of cheese.

27:42.955 --> 27:46.583
-Okay, that was mean.
-No, Lisey, it's true. I'm gonna stop.

27:47.876 --> 27:52.840
When you look at me,
you see me top to bottom, side to side.

27:52.923 --> 27:54.466
Everything weighs the same.

27:56.802 --> 27:59.137
When the door closes, we're eye to eye.

28:00.889 --> 28:02.641
It's just you and me, Lisey.

28:52.566 --> 28:54.401
Hey, babe. I gotta get in there.

29:12.169 --> 29:13.170
Scott?

30:28.787 --> 30:29.997
Where'd you go?

31:00.736 --> 31:01.987
Oh, my God.

31:04.114 --> 31:07.743
Still think I need to go to
the emergency room? Because I don't.

31:10.495 --> 31:11.663
Looks good, huh?

31:13.457 --> 31:14.625
One egg or two?

31:16.168 --> 31:17.169
Two, I guess.

31:17.252 --> 31:20.047
Over easy or want 'em looking at you?

31:21.673 --> 31:22.883
Over easy.

31:27.095 --> 31:28.096
So...

31:30.516 --> 31:31.767
will we marry?

31:35.562 --> 31:36.772
Are you sure?

31:37.773 --> 31:39.107
Sure shot.

31:40.859 --> 31:42.277
What do you think, babyluv?

31:45.405 --> 31:47.407
Babyluv thinks it's a plan.

31:52.412 --> 31:53.705
Good.

31:55.040 --> 31:56.667
That's good.

32:10.472 --> 32:12.641
Did you get up in the middle
of the night last night?

32:12.724 --> 32:13.767
No.

32:16.854 --> 32:18.355
I must have dreamt it.

32:27.072 --> 32:29.783
That's 5:30. Okay, right this way.

32:50.012 --> 32:51.805
All right, you two. Stay close.

32:55.475 --> 32:58.854
Scott, hold up that check
from the publisher so we can see it.

33:39.895 --> 33:41.563
I said Doctor

33:42.439 --> 33:43.899
Mr. M.D.

33:45.234 --> 33:48.111
Tell me what's wrong with me

33:49.321 --> 33:51.031
I said Doctor

33:52.866 --> 33:54.576
Mrs. Landon. Lisey.

33:54.660 --> 33:56.328
Your sister's condition
hasn't changed,

33:56.411 --> 33:58.622
but I do think a visit from you
would help things.

33:58.705 --> 34:02.376
Oh, I'm-- I'm-- I'm coming in tomorrow,
but that-- that's not why I'm calling.

34:02.459 --> 34:06.797
I, I wanted to,
I wanted to ask you about something.

34:06.880 --> 34:11.552
You said that when-- when Scott came--
came in to talk about Amanda

34:11.635 --> 34:13.178
that he-- that he signed your books?

34:14.304 --> 34:16.389
Yes. It was very kind of him.

34:16.473 --> 34:17.474
Did you...

34:18.600 --> 34:20.435
Did you tell him that you had a favorite?

34:21.228 --> 34:22.353
As a matter of fact, I did.

34:22.437 --> 34:26.149
Battle Flags. I've always been partial
to stories of love and--

34:26.233 --> 34:28.944
Would you--
Would you do me a favor and look inside?

34:29.027 --> 34:32.489
Because I think Scott
may have left me, um, a message.

34:33.197 --> 34:34.992
Would-- would you-- would you check?

34:35.742 --> 34:36.743
If you like.

35:11.486 --> 35:13.655
Lisey, there is something.

35:13.739 --> 35:14.948
What does it say?

35:15.824 --> 35:19.953
"Cedar box," "Fourth clue" and "Bool."

35:21.580 --> 35:24.958
Remarkable. But, you know,
he was a remarkable man.

35:25.042 --> 35:27.336
He keeps... pushing me.

35:27.419 --> 35:31.924
I mean, he's-- he's dead, but he just--
He keeps pushing me.

35:33.091 --> 35:34.968
Toward what, Lisey?

35:35.052 --> 35:39.848
-My past. Family. Memories. Anyway.
-But...

35:39.932 --> 35:41.850
Thank you. Thank you so much.

35:41.934 --> 35:45.145
Thank you for your help, and I'll see you
tomorrow. Thanks. Bye.

35:47.606 --> 35:49.441
Stop pushing me, Scott.

35:51.818 --> 35:53.570
You're dead, so stop.

36:28.814 --> 36:30.190
Is this your house?

36:30.274 --> 36:31.358
Excuse me?

36:32.484 --> 36:34.611
Just Scott Landon used to live here.

36:36.905 --> 36:37.906
Who?

36:38.490 --> 36:40.450
Scott Landon, famous writer.

36:40.534 --> 36:43.120
Battle Flags, Empty Devils,
Coaster's Daughter.

36:44.288 --> 36:47.457
I don't read books. I watch TV.

36:48.041 --> 36:50.878
Oh. TV, do you?

36:51.795 --> 36:54.631
Yeah. Not that it's any business of yours.

36:54.715 --> 36:58.343
Okay. Yeah, TV, sure.
The great electronic tit.

36:59.970 --> 37:01.054
The what?

37:02.347 --> 37:07.311
I should've known. You got TV eyes.
You got a little TV in each one.

37:08.353 --> 37:10.063
What are you talkin' about?

37:10.147 --> 37:11.190
When you open your mouth,

37:11.273 --> 37:16.570
I can see TV light shining down through
your eyes and coming out from your teeth.

37:20.991 --> 37:22.326
Why don't you get out of here?

37:26.246 --> 37:27.581
I'm tellin' you to get out of here.

37:27.664 --> 37:31.210
Why don't you go to the library and read
about Scott Landon and leave the TV eyes?

37:33.712 --> 37:35.714
I think that's what you should do,
don't you?

37:41.345 --> 37:43.305
You're living in the cradle of greatness.

37:45.682 --> 37:46.683
You got a wife?

37:49.353 --> 37:51.104
-No.
-Good.

37:52.397 --> 37:55.400
Why don't you go microwave yourself
a TV dinner or somethin'?

37:59.655 --> 38:00.822
No wife.

38:02.991 --> 38:03.992
Stay single.

39:11.768 --> 39:12.853
Lisey?

39:12.936 --> 39:14.146
Yeah?

39:14.229 --> 39:16.190
Hi. Chief's expecting you.

39:18.692 --> 39:19.943
Come with me.

39:21.111 --> 39:24.990
The professor claims he tried to get in
touch with Dooley right after you called

39:25.073 --> 39:27.659
but got a message saying Dooley's phone
had been disconnected.

39:27.743 --> 39:30.662
My husband would have called that
an ominous plot twist.

39:31.330 --> 39:33.582
He says Dooley's email address
worked until today,

39:33.665 --> 39:35.626
but now his emails just bounce back.

39:36.502 --> 39:38.587
Like he doesn't want to be called off.

39:39.338 --> 39:43.592
Dashmiel says Dooley drives
a Toyota sedan with Tennessee plates.

39:44.259 --> 39:47.596
An old bumper sticker on the back
that says, "Scott Landon for President."

39:47.679 --> 39:51.558
You know what a small force this is, but
all my guys have a description of the car.

39:51.642 --> 39:53.185
-State police too.
-Good.

39:53.936 --> 39:57.773
I'll have an officer swing by every hour
or two starting at 5:00 this afternoon.

39:57.856 --> 40:01.276
And there'll be a unit parked down the
road tonight, unless there's a callout.

40:01.360 --> 40:04.905
This-- This seems above and beyond.
I don't know. I'm...

40:04.988 --> 40:07.616
This is what we call a credible threat.

40:08.408 --> 40:10.827
Besides, the library, the rec,

40:11.662 --> 40:14.998
rebuilding the town square bandstand
after the fire, that was you guys.

40:15.082 --> 40:16.083
This town owes you.

40:18.335 --> 40:21.338
Do you think that there's any
way that Scott could have

40:21.421 --> 40:25.926
foreseen someone like Dooley,
try to warn me in advance?

40:26.426 --> 40:28.512
Scott almost got killed by a lunatic.

40:29.221 --> 40:30.764
If not for you, he would've been killed.

40:30.848 --> 40:32.891
Course he'd wanna return the favor.

40:32.975 --> 40:34.643
Yeah, that's-- that's true.

40:34.726 --> 40:36.562
Not that even Scott Landon
could see the future.

40:38.230 --> 40:40.399
He was talented, but not that talented.

40:42.776 --> 40:43.777
Right.

40:44.987 --> 40:47.531
You know, Dashmiel isn't gonna
show up at your place again.

40:47.614 --> 40:51.118
He's learned his lesson.
But Dooley's worrisome.

40:51.618 --> 40:54.496
If we spot him, he'll be arrested
for criminal threatening.

40:54.580 --> 40:58.292
Usually these guys are just
puff and blow, but stay alert.

40:58.917 --> 41:00.419
And all doors locked, right?

41:00.961 --> 41:01.962
Right.

41:02.796 --> 41:05.132
-Do you have a firearm?
-I hate guns.

41:06.466 --> 41:08.844
But I do have something
that worked before.

44:52.818 --> 44:53.819
Fuck.

45:06.206 --> 45:08.000
Oh, fucking fuckwad fuck!

45:27.811 --> 45:30.814
"Missus, wasn't nice
the way you yelled on the phone.

45:31.398 --> 45:34.776
Yelling is easy. It's being nice
that's tough. I love animals.

45:36.111 --> 45:38.113
My mama would say I love them too much.

45:38.780 --> 45:40.282
Well, she loved me too much.

45:40.782 --> 45:44.661
Everything deserves to be hurt sometimes.
Guess it was the bird's turn.

45:45.329 --> 45:47.372
Scott Landon's papers don't belong to you.

45:47.456 --> 45:50.501
You need to call The Man and tell him
you're turning over those papers.

45:50.584 --> 45:52.044
You have sat on them long enough.

45:52.127 --> 45:55.547
You are a bad woman.
I'd like to put you in the microwave.

45:56.048 --> 46:00.010
But let's not let any grass grow
under our feet so no one gets hurt.

46:00.093 --> 46:01.094
Except your pet."

46:04.097 --> 46:05.432
"Your friend, Jim."

46:07.392 --> 46:09.853
You were right
to put it in the freezer, Miss Landon.

46:09.937 --> 46:11.104
That was smart.

46:11.188 --> 46:16.068
There's signs of strangulation
and it smells like it was cooked.

46:16.902 --> 46:20.155
Relocating temporarily
might not be a bad idea.

46:21.031 --> 46:25.827
There's that hotel in Lewiston.
It looks nice. You'd be close to Amanda.

46:25.911 --> 46:27.037
Nah.

46:27.120 --> 46:29.039
If he shows up, I'll clock him.

46:29.122 --> 46:30.999
Don't be ridiculous, Lisa.

46:31.083 --> 46:33.085
If you really mean to stay,

46:33.168 --> 46:35.254
I'd feel more comfortable
if you had a firearm.

46:37.172 --> 46:38.465
You might. I wouldn't.

46:39.091 --> 46:41.552
-Oh, Ama-- Amanda has a gun.
-What?

46:42.261 --> 46:44.304
Yeah, she's got that little .22.
She's had it for years.

46:44.388 --> 46:46.765
Our suicidal sister has a gun
and you didn't tell me?

46:46.849 --> 46:48.725
Well, she's a cutter. She's not a shooter.

46:48.809 --> 46:49.810
There's a first time for everything.

46:49.893 --> 46:53.188
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You're
the expert. Ugh, what was I thinking?

46:53.272 --> 46:54.606
She-- She knows everything. She does.

46:54.690 --> 46:58.652
I mean, she learned most of it
after she got rich. Sad.

47:03.323 --> 47:04.867
Where is your sister?

47:04.950 --> 47:08.203
She's-- I'm sorry,
she's not in the area, Chief Richards--

47:08.287 --> 47:09.872
She's in Lewiston.

47:10.497 --> 47:12.666
Greenlawn. It's a hospital.

47:13.375 --> 47:15.002
Yeah, I-I know what it is.

47:15.752 --> 47:18.380
Guess she's safe enough there.

47:20.174 --> 47:23.635
Have you ever shot anyone?
Seen anyone shot?

47:27.014 --> 47:28.265
Fortunately, no.

47:28.849 --> 47:31.643
I have. Up close.

47:31.727 --> 47:34.104
So, no gun.

47:35.522 --> 47:37.482
There'll be a unit parked
outside your house tonight

47:37.566 --> 47:39.735
and every night till we nail this guy.

47:41.195 --> 47:42.321
Thank you.

47:43.864 --> 47:45.532
Is he gonna stand guard all night?

47:45.616 --> 47:49.411
-I don't know. Probably.
-Probably? That's not good enough.

47:49.870 --> 47:51.246
I'm gonna go to that hotel.

47:51.330 --> 47:53.999
Okay, get something nice.
Book yourself a suite.

47:54.082 --> 47:55.459
Oh, yeah? You payin'?

47:55.542 --> 47:57.085
Yes, I will.

47:57.169 --> 47:59.963
Well, you can certainly afford it.
How much money have you got?

48:00.047 --> 48:01.048
A lot.

48:01.632 --> 48:05.552
Okay. You're crazy to stay here.

48:07.429 --> 48:09.598
He's not gonna come back tonight.
I can feel it.

48:09.681 --> 48:11.016
Oh, you can feel it?

48:11.099 --> 48:14.645
Well, yeah. Keep talking like that,
you're gonna end up like Amanda.

48:18.232 --> 48:21.527
Hey, do you know if Amanda
has Ma's cedar box?

48:22.194 --> 48:24.446
Wasn't that one of the things
that she took

48:24.530 --> 48:26.490
when we cleaned out the house
after the funeral?

48:26.573 --> 48:29.243
Jesus, what made you think of that?

48:29.326 --> 48:31.787
I don't know, I liked it.
I was just thinking about it.

48:31.870 --> 48:35.123
Like, I liked how it smelled.
Will you ask her about it?

48:35.207 --> 48:36.458
Yeah.

48:36.542 --> 48:39.586
Yeah, that's the first thing I'm gonna
ask her about tomorrow when I see her.

48:39.670 --> 48:41.880
-Are you coming?
-Yeah, I'm coming. Will you ask her?

48:41.964 --> 48:43.549
-Are you coming?
-Yes, I'm coming.

48:43.632 --> 48:45.509
-Yes, I'll ask her.
-Thank you.

48:48.595 --> 48:49.596
Be careful.

49:55.245 --> 49:56.413
It's not real.

49:58.582 --> 49:59.583
It's not real.

50:01.293 --> 50:02.503
It's not real.

50:08.717 --> 50:12.304
-What is that?
-It will hear you.

50:16.642 --> 50:17.935
I don't-- I don't wanna be here.

50:18.018 --> 50:20.479
I don't-- I don't like this place.
I don't wanna be here.

50:22.189 --> 50:24.650
It will hear you.

50:31.323 --> 50:32.533
I don't wanna be here.

50:33.575 --> 50:38.914
Be quiet.
I need to think about why I did it.

50:38.997 --> 50:40.874
I don't wanna be here.

50:40.958 --> 50:44.086
I need to think about why I killed them.

50:45.170 --> 50:46.547
I killed them all.
