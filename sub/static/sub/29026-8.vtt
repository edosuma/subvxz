24:38.287 --> 24:39.874
It was a nightmare finding good weed.

‐ That is weird.

25:12.648 --> 25:14.025
MATTY: <i>Gets weirder.</i>

25:14.025 --> 25:16.196
<i>There's one missing carbon</i>

MATTY: <i>It had to be Penn. Right?</i>

25:26.509 --> 25:28.638

26:24.792 --> 26:27.421
He wrote
a suicide note‐slash‐confession.

26:27.421 --> 26:29.718
And before you ask,
yes, it's a limerick.

26:29.718 --> 26:32.766
‐ The receipt that showed Don made
the delivery that night wasn't sequential.

26:32.766 --> 26:34.185
It came from a different ticket book.

26:35.229 --> 26:37.191
‐ Like the ticket was put there later.

26:38.778 --> 26:42.076
After I mentioned the frat boys
at Murderheads, you planted it.

You wanna help me finish that?

27:02.199 --> 27:04.203
Why rhymes with "lethal injection"?

27:04.203 --> 27:06.291

27:16.019 --> 27:17.021
KEITH: Fourteen.
PENN: Okay.

27:17.021 --> 27:20.402
Guys, on any given night at Cho's,
we had multiple ticket books running.

27:20.402 --> 27:22.866
The fact that they're out of sequence
is not that strange.

27:22.866 --> 27:25.287
‐ We'll call Matty.
See if she finds other orders

27:25.287 --> 27:26.957

‐ Sure.

27:26.957 --> 27:28.920

27:30.965 --> 27:33.011

‐ What?

27:33.011 --> 27:34.848
‐ The bomb threat.

27:34.848 --> 27:37.019
"I'll be gloating. Bodies exploding.

27:37.019 --> 27:39.190
The heroes upon whom we're doting."

27:40.192 --> 27:41.862
It's the ceremony honoring Jake Kane.

27:41.862 --> 27:44.450
‐ What about the Fiji business?
‐ I don't know, maybe it was put there

27:44.450 --> 27:46.287
to get us looking
in the wrong direction?

27:46.287 --> 27:48.208
All right, we're ten minutes
from the school.

27:48.208 --> 27:49.586
Thirteen minutes

28:27.621 --> 28:30.250
I had planned on retiring this year

28:30.250 --> 28:34.091
after 15 years as principal
at Neptune High.

28:34.091 --> 28:38.809
But when Superintendent Dillawitz
showed me the blueprints for Kane High

28:38.809 --> 28:42.776

I said, "You know what? I'm in!"

28:45.948 --> 28:48.453
What Neptune is today

28:48.453 --> 28:53.547

who revolutionized the high‐tech industry:

Ah, and thanks particularly

29:10.832 --> 29:15.675
to the band director,
to the National Honor Society sponsor,

‐ And for those dedicated students

29:22.564 --> 29:25.945
who came out today entirely
of their own volition

29:25.945 --> 29:29.703
to see a 60‐year‐old man

Get a life, nerds.

you're doing?

You can either argue with me
or you can help get kids out of here!

30:26.859 --> 30:29.614

We can all die together.

30:33.246 --> 30:34.958
