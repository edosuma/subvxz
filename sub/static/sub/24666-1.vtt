that our country provides

32:29.395 --> 32:30.362
and you have provided.

32:30.396 --> 32:32.364
- Amen.
- Amen.

32:32.398 --> 32:34.366
So everybody born
and bred here, or...

32:34.400 --> 32:36.782
- Lisa's from California.
- Mm-hmm.

32:36.816 --> 32:38.501
So when you came here,
that was the first time

32:38.508 --> 32:39.743
you shot a gun, wasn't it?
Yeah.

32:39.750 --> 32:41.994
Show him your arm.

32:42.029 --> 32:44.479
Yeah, show him your tat.
She got an AK tat.

32:44.514 --> 32:46.481
AK tattooed on her arm.

32:46.516 --> 32:48.345
I lived in Canada
for a long time.

32:48.380 --> 32:50.037
Stayed in England
for quite a while.

32:50.071 --> 32:51.624
Sweden for quite a while.

32:51.659 --> 32:53.695
No matter how long I'm gone,
I always come back.

32:53.730 --> 32:55.904
You can't just load the Jeep up
with a bunch of guns

32:55.939 --> 32:58.631
and stay out there
for seven days and, you know...

32:58.666 --> 33:00.668
You can't really do
that anywhere else.

33:00.702 --> 33:02.007
That's probably one of
the greatest things

33:02.014 --> 33:03.498
about West Virginia.

33:03.533 --> 33:06.743
You know, we can enjoy
whatever we want to enjoy.

33:06.777 --> 33:10.126
I'm not trying to force
my opinions on anybody else.

33:10.160 --> 33:12.059
That being said,
we will defend ours.

33:12.093 --> 33:14.647
- Yeah.
- I was guessing.

33:14.682 --> 33:16.235
Yeah.

33:16.270 --> 33:17.926
Look, I grew up
in an environment,

33:17.961 --> 33:21.240
you see somebody at the
supermarket carrying a handgun,

33:21.275 --> 33:24.726
that would be cause
for red alert.

33:24.761 --> 33:27.833
Do you think there can be
common ground between somebody

33:27.867 --> 33:30.939
who grew up absolutely
thinking guns are a bad thing?

33:30.974 --> 33:32.527
I say no.

33:32.562 --> 33:34.177
Okay, you're an honest man,
and I appreciate it.

33:34.184 --> 33:35.254
Why do you...

33:35.289 --> 33:37.360
I'm a responsible gun owner.

33:37.394 --> 33:40.673
Why should I be crippled
in what I'm able to do

33:40.708 --> 33:42.537
as far as protecting my family?

33:42.572 --> 33:45.264
Look, I hear you, but there's
a fair number of people

33:45.299 --> 33:47.611
in this world who are just,
you know,

33:47.646 --> 33:49.786
too dumb to pour piss
out of a boot.

33:49.820 --> 33:52.754
You know, 90-year-old
drivers in Florida,

33:52.789 --> 33:55.343
they still got their license,
but should they be driving?

33:55.378 --> 33:57.276
- Right.
- A few years ago,

33:57.311 --> 33:58.795
my father was involved
in a shooting

33:58.829 --> 34:00.969
at his pharmacy
that he works at.

34:01.004 --> 34:02.454
A man came in.
He had a weapon.

34:02.488 --> 34:03.696
My dad conceal carries.

34:03.731 --> 34:05.077
He has a license
to conceal carry.

34:05.112 --> 34:06.596
He drew his weapon and fired.

34:06.630 --> 34:08.804
If they take guns away
from law-abiding citizens,

34:08.839 --> 34:11.187
then it's just gonna be
the criminals that have it.

34:13.637 --> 34:15.087
It should be pointed out...

34:15.121 --> 34:18.297
It has to be pointed out,
faced head-on...

34:18.331 --> 34:20.299
That shortly after
we filmed here,

34:20.333 --> 34:23.784
a gunman in Las Vegas,
with a perfectly legal weapon,

34:23.820 --> 34:27.547
fired off 1,100 rounds
in ten minutes,

34:27.581 --> 34:32.967
wounding 422 people
and killing 58.

34:33.001 --> 34:35.418
Shortly after that, 17 students

34:35.452 --> 34:37.420
were murdered
in Parkland, Florida,

34:37.454 --> 34:41.009
with a legally purchased
semi-automatic rifle,

34:41.043 --> 34:43.804
and the list goes on,
with victims of mass shootings

34:43.840 --> 34:46.152
that have happened
since this conversation

34:46.187 --> 34:47.637
measured in the hundreds,

You know, the way
that Appalachian food

46:46.769 --> 46:47.943
has always worked

46:47.977 --> 46:49.289
is you work with
within your means,

46:49.323 --> 46:51.049
and you create something
pretty special

46:51.084 --> 46:52.844
out of what you have
at your disposal,

46:52.879 --> 46:55.467
and we've kind of suffered
from this in a way.

46:55.502 --> 46:58.229
It created this sort of rush
towards the middle class

46:58.263 --> 46:59.817
