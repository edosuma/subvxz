WEBVTT

00:06.197 --> 00:08.976
You found me.
Nothing else matters.

00:10.762 --> 00:13.743
This is Thomas Magnum. He's
with the security company.

00:13.865 --> 00:17.278
Nobody ever crosses Sam.
Nobody ever outsmarts him.

00:17.335 --> 00:21.613
Anybody tries to take something that
belongs to me, I take care of them myself.

00:22.406 --> 00:25.615
I am the only one who can link him to the deaths.
He'll have to kill me.

00:25.676 --> 00:27.383
You have to come over
right away.

00:27.445 --> 00:28.651
<i>You better bring your gun.</i>

01:39.884 --> 01:42.763
<i>There's something hypnotic
about the climate in Hawaii.</i>

01:42.820 --> 01:45.164
<i>Every day, it's sunny
and 80 degrees.</i>

01:45.389 --> 01:49.064
<i>Every day, there are gentle trade winds
to take the edge off the humidity.</i>

01:49.126 --> 01:50.127
<i>Every day-</i>

01:52.496 --> 01:54.305
<i>Until the Kona winds come up.</i>

02:02.073 --> 02:04.713
<i>The Kona winds
come from the south,</i>

02:04.775 --> 02:08.951
<i>from somewhere in the vastness of the Pacific Ocean.
And, as they travel toward the</i>

02:09.013 --> 02:12.961
<i>unprotected chain of islands sitting,
vulnerable, in the huge expanse of water,</i>

02:13.217 --> 02:16.755
<i>they pick up power
and speed and force,</i>

02:17.121 --> 02:20.330
<i>finally crashing into the
scattered bits of land.</i>

02:21.859 --> 02:25.204
<i>But the Kona winds do more than
whip the sea into a frenzy.</i>

02:25.329 --> 02:29.505
<i>They stir the blood and tear at the
emotions, thrusting even temperate men</i>

02:29.567 --> 02:31.808
<i>into destinies they
may later regret.</i>

02:32.970 --> 02:36.577
<i>I've always felt drawn to the land's
edge to watch the winds come in,</i>

02:37.508 --> 02:40.717
<i>as if I were somehow
part of the drama.</i>

04:42.466 --> 04:44.639
I'm not even sure
what happened.

04:46.737 --> 04:48.239
Do you think it was the wind?

04:48.339 --> 04:50.979
Of course it was the wind.
What else could it have been?

04:52.276 --> 04:53.983
I might have jumped.

04:56.414 --> 04:57.518
Did you?

04:58.349 --> 04:59.521
No.

05:00.651 --> 05:03.757
I don't know. I'm not sure
of anything anymore.

05:04.388 --> 05:06.629
I'm not even sure
you should have saved me.

05:06.857 --> 05:08.928
Don't ever say
something like that.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.205
My husband is
going to kill me.

05:22.006 --> 05:23.110
It's the wind.

05:24.875 --> 05:26.183
What you're saying is...

05:26.310 --> 05:28.221
Very serious. I know.

05:31.715 --> 05:33.194
You have some kind of proof?

05:36.854 --> 05:39.960
For some reason I woke up in the
middle of the night last night.

05:40.357 --> 05:42.837
There were voices
on the patio below.

05:42.893 --> 05:44.338
Angry voices.

05:44.995 --> 05:47.100
At first I thought
it must be the wind.

05:47.598 --> 05:50.807
But I went to the window
and I saw my husband.

05:51.969 --> 05:56.247
His face was distorted
with anger and Charlie was...

05:56.474 --> 05:57.612
Charlie?

05:57.942 --> 05:59.979
His partner, his best friend.

06:01.545 --> 06:05.357
Was yelling at him, something
about inspections and bribery,

06:05.816 --> 06:07.625
that Sam was to blame.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.597
And then Sam pulled the gun
out of his pocket,

06:13.257 --> 06:15.999
and he shot him.
He killed him.

06:17.761 --> 06:18.762
And you saw it?

06:20.264 --> 06:22.767
I might have screamed.
I don't remember.

06:23.767 --> 06:27.237
Since that moment, I've been numb.
Shock, I guess.

06:28.339 --> 06:29.841
Nothing seems quite real.

06:30.741 --> 06:32.049
What did the police say?

06:32.176 --> 06:34.622
I can't call them. What
if they don't believe me?

06:37.081 --> 06:40.426
When Sam came to bed,
I pretended I was asleep.

06:41.685 --> 06:44.859
But every time he looks at me,
I'm sure he knows.

06:45.456 --> 06:47.493
And I'm sure
he's going to kill me, too.

06:48.859 --> 06:50.065
Magnum!

06:52.796 --> 06:54.207
That's not the wind.

06:54.932 --> 06:57.208
It's Higgins. He lives here.

06:59.303 --> 07:00.748
You won't tell him about me.

07:00.838 --> 07:02.181
Magnum, where are you?

07:02.239 --> 07:05.777
If Sam didn't see me, I made a
terrible mistake in confiding in you.

07:05.843 --> 07:07.015
No, you haven't.

07:07.077 --> 07:10.251
Look, I'm just going to find out what
Higgins wants. I'll be right back.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.763
You're safe here.

07:28.532 --> 07:29.636
<i>With the
most extensive Higgins!</i>

07:29.700 --> 07:31.407
<i>damage on the outer islands,</i>

07:31.502 --> 07:34.346
<i>several resort hotels were
flooded by the storm surge,</i>

07:34.405 --> 07:35.941
<i>which smashed 30-foot waves...</i>

07:36.006 --> 07:37.144
We have 24 hours.

07:37.208 --> 07:40.985
<i>Meanwhile, tropical storm
Po'ipe is brewing less than 300 miles</i>

07:41.045 --> 07:42.922
<i>off the north shore of Oahu.</i>

07:43.013 --> 07:46.324
<i>It is expected that Po'ipe will unleash
four times the destructive force...</i>

07:46.383 --> 07:50.388
Put these on and follow me. We
don't have a moment to spare.

07:52.256 --> 07:53.257
But...

07:56.026 --> 07:57.027
Higgins!

07:57.094 --> 08:00.007
We'll need to put masking tape
on every window on the estate

08:00.064 --> 08:03.534
because in the event we're struck with
90-mile-an-hour winds, the glass will shatter.

08:03.601 --> 08:04.773
Well, yeah, but
before we do that...

08:04.835 --> 08:08.510
A drastic step, to be sure, but one far
preferable to having giant shards of glass

08:08.572 --> 08:12.110
flying throughout the house. I estimate
we'll need a dozen rolls, two-inch width,

08:12.176 --> 08:13.416
100-yard length.

08:13.477 --> 08:17.118
Additionally, we will need three or four
five-gallon containers of bottled water,

08:17.181 --> 08:21.561
four hurricane lamps, six dozen candles, an
assortment of batteries and a can opener.

08:21.719 --> 08:23.357
A can opener?

08:24.221 --> 08:26.497
Will you slow down?
I need to talk to you.

08:26.557 --> 08:29.401
Take a look at this. The engine
which operates the estate's

08:29.460 --> 08:33.033
generator system, our only source
of power should a blackout occur.

08:43.006 --> 08:44.987
It sounds like it needs a tune-up.
Precisely.

08:45.042 --> 08:47.784
If you don't have the skills to attend
to it personally, hire a mechanic.

08:47.845 --> 08:49.791
Everything must be in
top-notch condition

08:49.847 --> 08:51.952
if we're gonna have any chance
of beating the storm.

08:52.016 --> 08:53.859
You sound like you're
addressing the troops.

08:53.917 --> 08:55.726
There's only one way to
approach these matters, Magnum.

08:55.786 --> 08:59.427
Head on. Meet aggression with aggression.
Whether the enemy is man or nature,

08:59.490 --> 09:01.094
the battle goes to the one
who is prepared.

09:01.158 --> 09:02.762
I shall expect nothing
less from you

09:02.826 --> 09:04.828
than full-scale cooperation.

09:04.928 --> 09:06.999
Wait. Wait a second, will you?

09:07.498 --> 09:08.670
There's plenty of time.

09:08.732 --> 09:11.008
According to the weather
report, 23 hours and...

09:11.068 --> 09:12.513
Fifty-five minutes.
And counting.

09:12.569 --> 09:14.242
I just need a minute!

09:17.341 --> 09:18.820
Look, Higgins, earlier today

09:18.876 --> 09:21.982
I came across someone
who'd had an accident.

09:22.046 --> 09:23.650
It was a woman.

09:24.048 --> 09:26.153
Higgins, now...
She almost drowned.

09:26.216 --> 09:28.423
And she's in trouble
and she's scared.

09:28.652 --> 09:33.431
And I told her this would be
a safe place for her to stay.

09:38.095 --> 09:41.838
Then I suggest you set out
immediately to ensure that it is.

10:17.301 --> 10:19.440
<i>It's another
beautiful day in paradise.</i>

10:19.937 --> 10:23.350
<i>It's hard to imagine that with
such blue skies and clear water</i>

10:23.474 --> 10:27.786
<i>that tropical storm Po'ipe is brewing up
trouble only a couple of hundred miles away.</i>

10:28.078 --> 10:31.753
<i>Meantime, clean-up operations
have begun on the outer islands.</i>

10:31.815 --> 10:34.853
<i>Medical and food supplies are
being flown in by helicopter,</i>

10:34.918 --> 10:37.762
<i>and work will begin today
restoring electrical service...</i>

10:38.756 --> 10:40.702
She didn't even
tell you her name?

10:40.791 --> 10:44.398
Well, she's in trouble. She's scared.
Maybe she doesn't trust me.

10:45.129 --> 10:48.508
Now, I wouldn't be surprised if she
felt like she couldn't trust anybody.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.072
Boy!

10:52.903 --> 10:55.179
You should have seen
her yesterday, T.C.

10:56.640 --> 10:59.018
There's something about her,
I don't know.

11:00.611 --> 11:02.557
That makes you want to
take care of her?

11:02.613 --> 11:05.287
Makes you want to do whatever
you have to do to find her

11:05.349 --> 11:07.556
and make sure everything's
all right for her?

11:09.586 --> 11:13.966
Look, she's practically a prisoner in her own house.
She's married to a man

11:14.024 --> 11:16.868
who spends most of his time
building a real estate empire.

11:17.060 --> 11:20.974
His whole life is controlling
and manipulating other people.

11:21.031 --> 11:23.238
She's no match
for a guy like that.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.977
If he is going to do
something to hurt her,

11:25.035 --> 11:27.037
how's she going to
protect herself?

11:27.137 --> 11:29.515
I thought you said she didn't
even tell you her name.

11:29.740 --> 11:30.741
She didn't.

11:30.808 --> 11:33.982
You know all this stuff about someone
who doesn't even tell you her name?

11:34.044 --> 11:37.753
Well, I am a private investigator, T.C.
I did a little investigating.

11:38.115 --> 11:40.595
I ran a check on her license
plate from her car.

11:40.651 --> 11:42.255
You ran a check through DMV?

11:42.719 --> 11:43.959
Well, Rick did.

11:44.021 --> 11:46.729
But the point is, the car is
registered to Sam Henderson.

11:47.090 --> 11:48.364
Sam Henderson?

11:48.492 --> 11:50.369
Yeah, wife's name is Lauren.

11:50.527 --> 11:52.939
Yeah, he owns one of the hotels
that got wiped out in the storm

11:52.996 --> 11:54.737
last night in Kumulani Bay.

11:54.865 --> 11:57.038
He owns hotels
on all the islands, T.C.

11:57.501 --> 11:59.276
So where does
it all lead to?

12:00.971 --> 12:02.609
I don't know. She ran away.

12:05.576 --> 12:07.419
Maybe she doesn't
even want my help.

12:10.380 --> 12:12.257
But maybe she needs it anyway.

12:12.516 --> 12:15.224
Well, thanks a lot
for the blankets.

12:15.752 --> 12:19.131
There's people on that island who
will really be needing these tonight.

12:22.593 --> 12:25.631
You think that second storm's
going to turn and miss us?

12:25.729 --> 12:29.609
I don't know. But you can't
worry about that, Thomas.

12:29.666 --> 12:32.374
You sure can't change
the course of the storm.

12:33.237 --> 12:36.241
You sure can't get out of its way
if it's gonna roll over you.

12:36.473 --> 12:39.886
In fact, all you can do is,
kind of, roll along with it

12:39.943 --> 12:42.446
and hope you don't get too
banged up in the process.

12:44.648 --> 12:45.991
You know,

12:46.583 --> 12:48.221
that's the thing about nature.

12:48.285 --> 12:50.094
It doesn't set out to
intentionally hurt you.

12:50.153 --> 12:51.962
But you can't say the
same thing about people.

12:52.022 --> 12:53.092
T.C.

12:55.926 --> 12:57.132
All right,

12:57.661 --> 13:01.302
I'll see what I can find out about
Henderson while I'm over there.

14:23.380 --> 14:26.850
<i>Hello, you have reached Thomas Magnum.
Please wait for the tone...</i>

14:28.885 --> 14:30.193
You found me.

14:32.089 --> 14:34.035
My husband just left
for Kumulani Bay.

14:35.192 --> 14:37.638
The hotel he and Charlie
were arguing about,

14:38.328 --> 14:40.137
it's been
completely destroyed.

14:40.397 --> 14:41.535
I know.

14:41.832 --> 14:43.140
People were killed.

14:43.333 --> 14:46.109
Nobody knew about the deaths
until a couple of hours ago.

14:46.670 --> 14:48.513
If it wasn't the storm,

14:49.606 --> 14:52.951
if it was what Charlie said,
bad construction...

14:54.311 --> 14:56.313
He could be charged
with wrongful death.

14:59.149 --> 15:02.153
He's gone to make sure there
isn't any evidence left to...

15:02.219 --> 15:03.892
To implicate him.

15:08.392 --> 15:11.839
I don't want to drag you into this,
but I don't know where else to turn.

15:12.729 --> 15:14.470
Once Sam comes back,

15:14.998 --> 15:17.410
I am the only one who can
implicate him with the deaths.

15:18.935 --> 15:20.414
He'll have to kill me.

15:20.504 --> 15:21.778
No, he won't.

15:23.840 --> 15:27.253
It doesn't matter, now.
You came after me.

15:27.611 --> 15:31.024
You found me.
Nothing else matters.

15:46.863 --> 15:47.898
Lauren, wait...

15:53.170 --> 15:54.615
I'm sorry.

16:01.778 --> 16:03.587
I'm gonna take you
to the police.

16:03.714 --> 16:04.852
There's nothing they can do.

16:04.915 --> 16:07.122
I want you to tell them
what you told me.

16:07.184 --> 16:10.529
That my husband killed his partner,
but I don't know where the body is?

16:10.587 --> 16:12.396
No body, no crime.
Isn't that how that goes?

16:12.456 --> 16:14.902
He's missing.
It's a place to start.

16:14.958 --> 16:18.132
His secretary said he was on vacation,
but she doesn't know where.

16:18.195 --> 16:19.196
I called.

16:21.698 --> 16:22.699
Lauren,

16:25.102 --> 16:26.638
are you sure?

16:26.837 --> 16:28.441
If you don't believe me,
nobody will.

16:28.505 --> 16:30.746
I believe you.
I do. I believe you.

16:32.242 --> 16:33.880
Come here.
Sit down, sit down...

16:37.681 --> 16:40.753
The police are gonna believe you, too,
if we come up with enough evidence.

16:40.817 --> 16:43.991
Now, all we have to do is prove that
he had the motive and the opportunity.

16:44.054 --> 16:45.260
How do we do that?

16:46.490 --> 16:49.528
Well, we'll start with the
inspector that Sam bribed.

16:49.893 --> 16:51.930
If Sam finds out we're looking
into this, he'll kill us.

16:51.995 --> 16:54.407
That's a risk
we're gonna have to take.

16:56.566 --> 16:59.740
Now you can't just sit here
waiting for him to come back.

17:04.241 --> 17:06.084
What about his office?

17:06.877 --> 17:09.323
They close up the office
at 5:00 on the dot.

17:14.050 --> 17:16.997
Here's the connection.
Greg Frazier, the site inspector.

17:17.053 --> 17:20.728
He also inspected the grating, the cement
work, the framing, plumbing, electrical...

17:20.790 --> 17:22.134
How'd they
get away with this?

17:22.192 --> 17:23.364
Is that unusual?

17:23.425 --> 17:25.770
Well, unless he's an expert
in every one of these fields,

17:25.829 --> 17:27.330
which is highly unlikely.

17:27.396 --> 17:28.603
But not impossible.

17:28.665 --> 17:30.736
Well, I'm sure that's what
Mr. Frazier will tell us.

17:30.801 --> 17:34.044
Unless we can put this together
with a record of payment.

17:34.638 --> 17:36.914
That's not exactly something
Sam would keep on file.

17:38.108 --> 17:39.553
Put that light out.

17:46.950 --> 17:48.122
It's okay.

17:51.822 --> 17:55.326
Suppose you're Sam. You pay
this guy a lot of money,

17:55.392 --> 17:58.737
but you want to make sure he
doesn't blackmail you for more.

17:58.862 --> 18:00.808
I mean, wouldn't you want to
keep a record of it around

18:00.864 --> 18:02.502
to show this guy
that he's implicated?

18:03.066 --> 18:05.171
That's exactly how
Sam would think.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.671
Where does he keep
his check registers?

18:08.004 --> 18:11.281
Anything he'd want to keep
hidden would be in his office.

18:26.823 --> 18:29.269
He told me he kept his
private papers in here.

18:30.894 --> 18:32.271
But where?

18:32.596 --> 18:33.904
Is there a safe?

18:34.764 --> 18:36.243
Of course.

18:39.469 --> 18:42.245
How like Sam to use this
picture to hide the safe.

18:42.305 --> 18:44.876
Do you have any idea
what the combination might be?

18:44.941 --> 18:48.150
His Social Security number?
That's too many numbers.

18:49.279 --> 18:51.691
Try, 10-7-40,
that's his birthday.

18:54.184 --> 18:55.959
Well, that's one down
and two to go.

18:56.086 --> 18:58.498
What do you mean? Well, this
kind of electronic lock

18:58.555 --> 19:02.503
gives you three chances, then it freezes
for 24 hours and sets off an alarm.

19:02.792 --> 19:06.638
Try 6-18-81. The photograph.
Our wedding day.

19:23.847 --> 19:25.849
Here's something, $2,500.

19:25.916 --> 19:27.589
It's made out to cash.

19:28.317 --> 19:30.661
Yeah, but it was written

19:31.087 --> 19:33.863
the same date the first permit
was signed off.

19:34.390 --> 19:36.199
And it's endorsed by
Greg Frazier.

19:36.626 --> 19:40.506
If we can find more of these checks for
the same amount for these other dates...

19:43.466 --> 19:44.968
It's a security
guard.

19:45.034 --> 19:47.014
Must be time for rounds. ls
there another way out of here?

19:47.069 --> 19:48.070
That way.

19:48.304 --> 19:50.306
<i>The only
question that remains is,</i>

19:50.473 --> 19:53.545
<i>how soon will she hit and
how much damage will she do?</i>

19:53.609 --> 19:57.216
<i>Thanks, Bill, if there's
anything we don't need, it's a second storm.</i>

19:57.280 --> 19:58.918
<i>Let's all keep
our fingers crossed.</i>

19:58.981 --> 20:01.325
<i>On the lighter side,
the Honolulu...</i>

20:20.036 --> 20:21.777
Sam's going to
find out we broke in.

20:21.871 --> 20:23.350
No, the guard
didn't see us.

20:42.158 --> 20:43.865
We have to go over
the papers.

20:43.926 --> 20:45.371
Yeah, we'll go back
to my place.

20:45.428 --> 20:49.433
No! There are other people there. We can't
take another chance on being seen together.

20:49.499 --> 20:51.001
No one will have to see us.

20:51.067 --> 20:52.876
I think we should
go to my house.

20:52.935 --> 20:55.472
Sam won't be back until tomorrow
afternoon at the earliest,

20:55.538 --> 20:57.575
but if he should call
and I'm not there...

21:05.681 --> 21:09.458
Do you feel that? It almost
feels as if the air is alive.

21:10.386 --> 21:11.763
It's the Kona winds.

21:18.861 --> 21:21.603
Do you realize
what you're doing? You idiot.

21:40.082 --> 21:44.053
I was very sheltered and
protected all my life. An only child.

21:45.354 --> 21:47.527
My mother died
when I was three.

21:47.823 --> 21:50.667
My father was remote, distant.

21:51.994 --> 21:54.099
He passed away when I was in
college,

21:54.163 --> 21:56.871
leaving me no resources
to survive on my own.

21:58.968 --> 22:02.973
I guess, I saw the Islands as a
retreat from a frightening world.

22:05.007 --> 22:07.385
I started working in
one of Sam's hotels.

22:09.111 --> 22:13.116
The minute he saw me, he
started a campaign to own me.

22:14.584 --> 22:17.622
He never gave me a chance to
think about what was happening.

22:17.687 --> 22:20.634
He wanted an ornament.
He got one.

22:21.691 --> 22:24.035
My marriage ended
on our wedding day.

22:24.193 --> 22:27.265
He locked me away in this house and
made sure I could never leave.

22:29.432 --> 22:32.379
I had no money, no friends,
no family.

22:33.936 --> 22:36.940
The one time I told him I was
unhappy and wanted to leave,

22:37.073 --> 22:38.814
he knocked me
across the room.

22:40.610 --> 22:43.750
Nobody ever crosses Sam.
Nobody ever outsmarts him.

22:48.651 --> 22:50.153
Maybe they do.

22:58.461 --> 23:01.635
He left a pretty good trail between
him and Inspector Frazier.

23:02.465 --> 23:04.536
Not good enough
to take to the police?

23:05.167 --> 23:08.774
No, it's not good enough by itself.
But if he left that trail,

23:09.305 --> 23:11.785
he's bound to have left
something else somewhere.

23:13.909 --> 23:17.322
I want you to go to Robin's Nest.
You'll be safe there with Higgins.

23:18.114 --> 23:20.025
It's better that I stay here.

23:22.018 --> 23:24.658
Keep Sam thinking
I'm not onto him yet.

23:27.223 --> 23:29.294
You'll stay
right by the phone?

23:30.626 --> 23:33.004
I'll call you just as soon as
I find something out.

24:03.259 --> 24:06.934
Sam, you're home early.
Everything all right?

24:07.229 --> 24:09.607
No. Everything's a mess.

24:10.499 --> 24:13.537
This is Thomas Magnum. He's
with the security company.

24:13.602 --> 24:15.377
He's been out
to check the house.

24:21.644 --> 24:23.681
Nice car, Thomas Magnum.

24:23.846 --> 24:24.847
Thank you.

24:26.248 --> 24:27.522
Some kind of trouble?

24:28.784 --> 24:31.628
Well, the winds seem to have
knocked out some of the systems

24:31.687 --> 24:34.463
at your neighbors' houses, but
yours is working just fine.

24:35.024 --> 24:36.901
Well, can't be too careful.

24:40.129 --> 24:42.735
Well, I've got to
file my reports.

24:43.833 --> 24:45.972
You checked the
whole house, did you?

24:48.537 --> 24:50.448
I think we covered everything.

24:51.507 --> 24:52.542
Oh...

24:52.608 --> 24:54.053
That's very thoughtful
of you, dear.

24:54.376 --> 24:56.549
We have an elaborate
system here, Mr. Magnum.

24:57.246 --> 24:58.418
It's quite good.

24:58.481 --> 24:59.858
I'm real proud of it.

25:00.049 --> 25:02.655
I'd like to show you a special
feature of the system.

25:02.785 --> 25:05.265
It's something that
I added myself.

25:08.824 --> 25:09.996
Mr. Magnum.

25:15.631 --> 25:18.805
This is the heart
of the system, Mr. Magnum.

25:22.671 --> 25:26.346
But you've already
seen it, haven't you?

25:28.344 --> 25:30.381
I believe in strong security,
Mr. Magnum.

25:30.446 --> 25:34.258
But I also believe that you have to
let would-be intruders know that

25:34.950 --> 25:36.258
you mean business.

25:37.319 --> 25:39.230
I don't think you'll have
any trouble with that.

25:39.288 --> 25:41.290
Any system
can let you down.

25:41.357 --> 25:44.065
But I have a backup that's
absolutely foolproof.

25:45.327 --> 25:50.401
Anybody tries to take something that
belongs to me, I take care of them myself.

26:07.383 --> 26:09.385
Looks like the second
storm is coming.

26:14.754 --> 26:18.449
<i>The encounter with Sam Henderson
had left me with the sobering realization</i>

26:18.508 --> 26:21.887
<i>that events were happening too
quickly and I was losing control.</i>

26:22.145 --> 26:24.523
<i>I know, some people say we don't
really have anything more</i>

26:24.581 --> 26:28.529
<i>than the illusion of control, anyway.
But I was losing even that.</i>

26:29.853 --> 26:32.299
<i>And it was unsettling.</i>

26:34.992 --> 26:37.302
<i>For some reason, fixing
the generator gave me</i>

26:37.361 --> 26:40.934
<i>a feeling that I did have some
influence over my universe,</i>

26:40.998 --> 26:43.740
<i>at least until
the second storm arrived.</i>

26:43.800 --> 26:46.781
<i>Then, I knew, everything
would be up for grabs.</i>

27:07.024 --> 27:08.367
Higgins?

27:10.060 --> 27:11.164
Higgins!

27:16.500 --> 27:17.740
What are you doing?

27:17.801 --> 27:20.782
I am clearing away the last painful
remnants of a battle lost.

27:20.871 --> 27:21.872
Battle lost?

27:21.939 --> 27:24.886
A glaring reminder of previous
defeat is bad for morale.

27:25.008 --> 27:27.284
I admit the winds yesterday
caught me a bit off guard.

27:27.377 --> 27:29.357
The surprise element
left us wide open.

27:29.446 --> 27:31.926
The carefully maintained order
with which this estate is run

27:31.982 --> 27:33.461
was turned into utter
and complete chaos.

27:33.517 --> 27:37.021
That will not happen again If the storm
should attack this part of the island,

27:37.087 --> 27:39.693
we shall be ready to do
battle and we shall prevail.

27:39.756 --> 27:42.760
This isn't a war, you know. I mean,
once nature sets its course,

27:42.826 --> 27:44.305
you can't do anything
to stop it.

27:44.361 --> 27:45.931
You can if you're British!

27:48.598 --> 27:50.703
<i>If I had paid
attention to the way the storm</i>

27:50.767 --> 27:52.542
<i>was affecting
everyone around me,</i>

27:52.602 --> 27:56.573
<i>I might have noticed that it was brewing
up some intense feelings in me.</i>

27:56.640 --> 27:58.984
<i>Although T. C. seemed
philosophical enough about it,</i>

27:59.042 --> 28:01.579
<i>Higgins was flailing around
for control.</i>

28:02.012 --> 28:06.688
<i>And when I called Rick to ask for his help,
he sounded distracted, almost giddy.</i>

28:06.750 --> 28:09.822
<i>And if I'd really paid
attention, I would have noticed</i>

28:09.886 --> 28:12.890
<i>that I was being driven by
forces I couldn't quite identify</i>

28:14.057 --> 28:16.663
<i>and taking chances I wouldn't
ordinarily take.</i>

28:20.063 --> 28:22.669
<i>With winds
gusting up to 75 miles an hour,</i>

28:22.733 --> 28:25.907
<i>the Coast Guard has issued
small-craft advisories.</i>

28:26.136 --> 28:30.482
<i>The National Weather Service is predicting
that tropical storm Po'ipe will turn into...</i>

28:30.540 --> 28:31.814
Hi.

28:32.109 --> 28:33.645
I'm sorry.

28:34.745 --> 28:36.315
Henderson and Brandon?

28:36.913 --> 28:38.483
Yes. Hi.
Hi.

28:38.782 --> 28:41.160
I'm with the Superior Mutual
Insurance Group.

28:41.218 --> 28:43.755
We carry the coverage on the
Kumulani Bay operation.

28:44.254 --> 28:46.564
Oh, why does everything
always happen at once?

28:46.723 --> 28:49.226
Listen, Mr. Henderson,
he's not in right now.

28:49.292 --> 28:52.796
But he's supposed to be back pretty soon
because he needs to talk to the police,

28:52.863 --> 28:54.365
so you're welcome to
wait, if you like. What?

28:54.431 --> 28:56.968
The police are involved in
the Kumulani Bay problem?

28:57.034 --> 29:00.072
What? No, not at all. It's
about the break-in last night.

29:00.137 --> 29:01.138
What?

29:02.305 --> 29:05.411
You know what? I probably shouldn't
be telling you any of this.

29:05.509 --> 29:07.182
Why don't you just wait
for Mr. Henderson?

29:07.244 --> 29:10.350
That's a shame. I mean, I kind
of wanted to wrap all this up

29:10.414 --> 29:12.121
before the end of the
work day in LA.

29:12.182 --> 29:15.129
I mean, you know how slow they can be
in issuing checks from the home office.

29:15.185 --> 29:16.823
I'll tell you what?
ls Mr. Brandon around?

29:16.887 --> 29:18.889
No, I'm sorry,
but he's on vacation.

29:18.955 --> 29:20.229
Oh, gee!

29:20.524 --> 29:23.698
You know, I just don't need that
much to get my paperwork done.

29:23.927 --> 29:28.398
See, the home office wasn't able to telex
me my copy of the insurance policy,

29:28.465 --> 29:31.469
so it would really help me out
if I could take a look at yours.

29:36.073 --> 29:37.677
Well, I...

29:37.941 --> 29:40.148
Well, all right.
I guess that'd be okay.

29:40.243 --> 29:41.779
Great, great.

29:43.346 --> 29:46.725
I'll also need copies of the purchase
orders of all your building materials,

29:46.783 --> 29:49.263
you know, just to verify replacement
cost, that sort of thing.

29:49.319 --> 29:52.528
You want to know what I'm going to do as
soon as Mr. Henderson gets back here?

29:52.589 --> 29:53.659
What?
Leave.

29:53.723 --> 29:54.895
The last place
I want to be

29:54.958 --> 29:56.960
is in the 12th floor of this
building when that storm hits.

29:57.027 --> 29:58.062
Oh, yeah.

29:58.128 --> 30:00.267
I'll bet Mr. Brandon...
Charlie, is it? Yeah.

30:00.330 --> 30:02.139
Yeah, well, I'll bet you
he's glad he's on vacation,

30:02.199 --> 30:04.179
what with all the weather
trouble here and everything.

30:04.234 --> 30:06.771
Yeah, well, I really wouldn't know
because I haven't talked to him.

30:06.837 --> 30:08.248
Do you know where I can
reach him?

30:08.305 --> 30:10.444
I mean, in case I need his
signature for anything?

30:10.640 --> 30:13.814
No, I don't. Now, here are the copies
of those purchase orders you needed.

30:13.877 --> 30:16.016
Oh, I really appreciate this.

30:17.814 --> 30:18.849
Let's see...

30:18.915 --> 30:20.826
Oh, here it is.
This is the insurance...

30:21.051 --> 30:24.032
Yeah, this is it. This is the insurance
file on the Kumulani Bay Hotel.

30:24.121 --> 30:25.122
Thank you.

30:26.690 --> 30:30.661
You know confidentially, I
mean, just between you and me,

30:31.595 --> 30:34.542
I don't blame you for not
wanting to stay up here.

30:34.598 --> 30:36.635
I mean, the storm has got
everybody so nervous.

30:36.700 --> 30:38.680
Well, you know what?
It's not just that.

30:38.768 --> 30:41.214
It's just...
I don't know, but

30:41.371 --> 30:43.681
things are just so
weird around here lately.

30:43.773 --> 30:45.218
Yeah, I'd noticed that myself.

30:45.275 --> 30:46.583
You did?
Yes.

30:46.643 --> 30:48.316
No, really, did you know... Yes!

30:48.378 --> 30:51.882
Did you know that Charlie took off and
never even told me where he was going?

30:52.015 --> 30:53.016
I mean, I...

30:53.116 --> 30:56.393
I don't know what I'm supposed to do about
all his luncheon appointments this week.

30:56.453 --> 30:59.434
Plus, we have the inspection
on the Waverly Waikiki Hotel.

30:59.489 --> 31:01.935
And you know, Charlie, he always
meets with the inspectors.

31:01.992 --> 31:04.131
And Mr. Henderson...
Please!

31:04.194 --> 31:07.266
Mr. Henderson is not about
to meet with those inspectors.

31:07.330 --> 31:08.900
And then last night,
I don't know if you...

31:08.965 --> 31:10.205
Did you hear about this?

31:10.267 --> 31:12.213
We had a break-in in here
last night.

31:12.836 --> 31:16.215
Yeah, I hope he calls in.
I really do, because...

31:16.573 --> 31:19.076
I'm going to tell him.
I'm just going to tell him

31:19.142 --> 31:21.679
what I think of this little
disappearing act of his.

31:26.016 --> 31:30.055
Listen to me. I'm going on
and on about my problems,

31:30.120 --> 31:32.031
and those poor people
of the Kumulani...

31:32.189 --> 31:35.466
I'm sorry. You know what? Don't
pay any attention to me, okay?

31:36.092 --> 31:38.003
It's all right.
It's the storm.

31:38.929 --> 31:40.169
Yeah, oh well.

31:40.297 --> 31:41.298
Anyway, look it,

31:41.364 --> 31:44.038
here are those Social
Security Numbers, and...

31:44.467 --> 31:47.209
You know, I really think that's
just about everything you need.

31:47.270 --> 31:48.408
Your other hotel?

31:49.739 --> 31:51.218
Oh, yeah.

31:51.841 --> 31:52.979
These are...

31:54.911 --> 31:57.323
Well, if you need
anything else, really,

31:57.380 --> 31:59.121
Mr. Henderson should be
back this afternoon.

31:59.683 --> 32:00.991
Thanks, uh...

32:01.985 --> 32:04.659
Oh, Cindy.
My name is Cindy.

32:04.788 --> 32:06.165
Thank you.
You're welcome.

32:09.659 --> 32:11.002
<i>The National Weather Bureau</i>

32:11.061 --> 32:13.302
<i>has advised travelers
to stay off the roads.</i>

32:13.730 --> 32:15.232
<i>Stay tuned for emergency
centers...</i>

32:51.568 --> 32:55.311
<i>An uneasy feeling began
creeping around the back of my mind.</i>

32:55.372 --> 32:58.842
<i>If Charlie always met with the
inspectors, how was it he didn't know</i>

32:58.908 --> 33:00.717
<i>about Sam paying
one of them off?</i>

33:01.077 --> 33:03.023
<i>Was it possible,
that Sam was,</i>

33:03.480 --> 33:05.926
<i>for some reason I couldn't
quite put together,</i>

33:06.116 --> 33:08.926
<i>concocting some elaborate
scheme to terrify Lauren?</i>

33:51.594 --> 33:53.631
Is this something
or is this something?

33:53.697 --> 33:57.372
Hey look what the wind blew in.
How you doing?

33:57.434 --> 33:59.710
You know
Big Ed Kanakoa, right?

33:59.869 --> 34:01.439
You did work for him
on his third divorce.

34:01.504 --> 34:03.711
I know, he puts on luaus.
Right!

34:03.773 --> 34:06.515
So I figured, if I'm gonna throw
a blowout for all my friends,

34:06.576 --> 34:09.750
who better to call than Big Ed
Kanakoa, the king of the luaus, right?

34:09.879 --> 34:11.358
Why are you throwing a party?

34:11.414 --> 34:13.257
Well, there's a second
storm coming in.

34:13.315 --> 34:15.489
You do two things
when a storm comes in:

34:15.552 --> 34:18.431
One, you lock your windows.
Two, you lock your doors.

34:18.487 --> 34:21.297
Then you boogie, boogie,
boogie until you drop.

34:22.158 --> 34:24.502
Hey, Thomas, we got an extra
seat over here!

34:24.561 --> 34:25.699
Why don't you
come and join us?

34:27.864 --> 34:29.775
What do you want?
Blue Hawaii, Chi Chi?

34:29.899 --> 34:32.208
Did you get anything on that
building inspector for me?

34:32.268 --> 34:35.772
Yeah, I called a friend of mine
who's in the cement business.

34:35.839 --> 34:38.717
He called a cousin of his who
is an electrical contractor...

34:38.775 --> 34:42.279
Rick, I don't have a lot of time.
Now, is he on the up and up or not?

34:43.313 --> 34:45.485
Not. Does it
help you out any?

34:45.547 --> 34:48.824
I think so. But there's something
else that doesn't quite fit.

34:49.219 --> 34:51.130
Can I use your phone?
Sure.

34:53.156 --> 34:54.498
In your office?

34:54.791 --> 34:57.863
Oh, come on, Thomas, I just spent
a fortune for this blowout.

34:57.927 --> 34:59.565
Don't tell me you're
not going to stick around.

34:59.629 --> 35:02.473
I'm sorry, Rick. I'll catch
the next one. Honest.

35:21.151 --> 35:24.655
<i>I knew I was chasing down a
ghost trying to find Charlie Brandon.</i>

35:25.355 --> 35:29.030
<i>But I figured, while I went through
the paperwork, I might as well try.</i>

35:29.826 --> 35:33.638
<i>If I could even prove he was missing,
that would help the case against Sam.</i>

35:34.564 --> 35:37.602
<i>I figured the very least I could
do was call the hotels he owned.</i>

35:38.201 --> 35:40.875
<i>He wasn't at
the Waverly Hotel, Bora Bora,</i>

35:41.805 --> 35:44.115
<i>he wasn't at the
Waverly Hotel, Tokyo,</i>

35:45.141 --> 35:47.519
<i>and I was willing to bet
odds he wasn't at the...</i>

35:47.644 --> 35:49.351
<i>Waverly Hotel, Melbourne.</i>

35:49.446 --> 35:51.016
Charles Brandon, please.

35:51.080 --> 35:52.491
<i>One moment please.</i>

35:52.982 --> 35:56.828
<i>After Australia, I only
had three more hotels to go.</i>

35:57.921 --> 35:58.922
<i>BRANDON.' Yeah?</i>

36:00.190 --> 36:01.294
Charlie Brandon?

36:01.357 --> 36:02.563
<i>Who's calling?</i>

36:02.759 --> 36:06.297
I'm your claims adjustor with
Empire Fidelity Insurance.

36:06.362 --> 36:09.434
We were just trying to cut through the
paperwork on the Kumulani Bay thing.

36:09.499 --> 36:12.173
I was just wondering if I could ask you
a couple of quick questions, you know.

36:12.235 --> 36:13.646
Shouldn't take but a minute.

36:13.703 --> 36:15.148
<i>How'd you get this number?</i>

36:15.805 --> 36:18.342
You know, if I can get
this form in by tonight,

36:18.408 --> 36:20.684
you should have
the first installment

36:20.743 --> 36:25.590
on your $6,000,000 insurance
benefit by tomorrow in the mail.

36:25.648 --> 36:27.559
<i>You're paying off
on the hotel?</i>

36:27.617 --> 36:29.688
Yeah, just as soon
as I fill out this form.

36:29.752 --> 36:31.823
You heard about
the storm, I guess?

36:31.888 --> 36:32.889
<i>Yeah.</i>

36:33.857 --> 36:36.667
I was wondering if you could tell
me your Social Security Number.

36:36.726 --> 36:39.468
See, I think it has been
left off the application.

36:40.263 --> 36:44.541
<i>074-38-2628.</i>

36:46.536 --> 36:49.949
074-38-2628?

36:50.974 --> 36:52.180
<i>That's right.</i>

36:53.843 --> 36:56.380
<i>Which insurance company
did you say you were with?</i>

36:57.213 --> 37:01.821
That should take care of it for us, Mr. Brandon.
You just have a nice vacation.

37:13.263 --> 37:16.642
I figured, if you can't bring
Magnum to the party,

37:16.699 --> 37:19.908
then bring the party
to Magnum.

37:19.969 --> 37:21.107
No thanks, Ed.

37:21.804 --> 37:24.546
Hey, I couldn't let you get
away without knowing if you

37:24.841 --> 37:26.718
heard from my boss's wife?
What?

37:27.377 --> 37:28.947
Sam Henderson's wife.

37:29.479 --> 37:31.720
I mean, she told me, you know,
it was on the q.t.,

37:31.781 --> 37:33.488
that she was looking
for a private eye.

37:33.616 --> 37:35.857
Hey, naturally,
I turned her on to you.

37:37.420 --> 37:38.558
When?

37:38.621 --> 37:41.568
Oh, I think, must have been
about a week ago.

37:42.058 --> 37:43.469
You mean, you never heard
from her?

37:43.526 --> 37:44.596
<i>Hello ?</i>

37:47.063 --> 37:48.474
The party's waiting for you.

37:49.999 --> 37:51.000
<i>Hello ?</i>

37:53.836 --> 37:54.906
Hello.

37:55.438 --> 37:56.610
Thomas!

37:56.673 --> 37:59.779
I've been trying to reach you. Where are you?
It doesn't matter.

38:00.543 --> 38:02.318
You have to come over
right away.

38:02.579 --> 38:04.183
<i>Sam's gone to the office
and...</i>

38:05.415 --> 38:07.827
Thomas,
I found Charlie's body.

38:09.886 --> 38:11.229
<i>Thomas, are you there?</i>

38:13.022 --> 38:14.092
Yes.

38:14.190 --> 38:17.330
<i>I've called the police, but you
have to come over right away.</i>

38:17.927 --> 38:20.635
<i>I'm so afraid Sam will get
home before the police arrive.</i>

38:21.931 --> 38:23.103
<i>Thomas?</i>

38:24.400 --> 38:26.073
Are you sure it's Charlie?

38:26.135 --> 38:29.514
<i>Of course, I'm sure. You're not
gonna start doubting me now?</i>

38:29.572 --> 38:32.678
<i>I need you. Please.
Won't you come over?</i>

38:34.310 --> 38:35.550
Yes.

38:35.678 --> 38:38.784
<i>Please, hurry. And Thomas,
just in case,</i>

38:39.549 --> 38:41.051
<i>you better bring your gun.</i>

39:37.588 --> 39:38.999
Hello, Lauren.

39:40.658 --> 39:41.830
Thomas.

39:44.862 --> 39:46.671
I wasn't sure you were coming.

39:52.970 --> 39:54.711
You lied to me about Charlie.

39:54.906 --> 39:55.907
No.

39:57.542 --> 39:59.112
You didn't find his body.

40:02.079 --> 40:03.820
What else did you
lie to me about?

40:04.115 --> 40:05.219
Nothing.

40:06.717 --> 40:08.594
You must believe me.

40:11.389 --> 40:15.531
I did lie about seeing the body. But
I was afraid you wouldn't come over.

40:15.760 --> 40:18.969
I knew I had to tell you something...
How about the truth?

40:19.463 --> 40:23.411
The truth was too complicated. I
couldn't tell you over the phone. Look.

40:26.304 --> 40:28.181
A quarter of a
million dollars.

40:30.975 --> 40:33.478
You remember those checks
made out to cash?

40:33.945 --> 40:36.585
There must have been more
of them than we ever imagined.

40:38.382 --> 40:39.759
How'd it get here?

40:40.084 --> 40:44.055
I'm not sure. I've been thinking
about that ever since I found it.

40:44.555 --> 40:45.727
And I think...

40:47.058 --> 40:49.436
Charlie was always
having money troubles.

40:49.527 --> 40:53.942
He must've forged Sam's name on those checks
to get access to some ready cash, fast.

40:54.065 --> 40:57.603
When Sam found out some money was missing,
he probably called Charlie over here.

40:58.135 --> 41:02.447
They got into a fight over the money, then
Charlie brought up the building inspector.

41:02.506 --> 41:06.955
That's when I woke up. Their
fight got out of hand and

41:07.044 --> 41:08.751
Charlie was killed.

41:10.281 --> 41:12.659
From there I can
only guess that

41:13.184 --> 41:15.721
Sam went to Charlie's to get the
money, brought it back here,

41:15.853 --> 41:16.854
put it in the safe.

41:17.755 --> 41:20.361
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

41:25.529 --> 41:26.701
Bye, Lauren.

41:27.598 --> 41:29.874
Where are you going?
Thomas!

41:30.368 --> 41:31.574
Thomas!

41:34.372 --> 41:38.912
Until you pulled me out of the ocean, I
didn't care whether I lived or died.

41:40.378 --> 41:44.520
Today, when I found this money, I
knew I wanted to live. With you.

41:46.150 --> 41:48.596
We can take the money and
leave. Now.

41:48.786 --> 41:51.767
Before Sam comes back and
kills us like he did Charlie.

41:51.889 --> 41:53.061
Sam didn't kill Charlie.

41:53.124 --> 41:55.866
He did. I saw it!
You must believe me!

41:55.926 --> 41:57.803
What a charming scene.

41:59.697 --> 42:02.837
Are you here to check the security
system again, Mr. Magnum?

42:03.968 --> 42:07.347
Thomas, you must kill him.
It's our only chance.

42:07.405 --> 42:10.409
Hardly the loving words
of a devoted wife, my dear.

42:10.474 --> 42:11.714
We can go
anywhere you want.

42:11.776 --> 42:13.517
When you think about it,
it's not very gracious of you

42:13.577 --> 42:15.955
to insist that our guest
commit homicide.

42:16.280 --> 42:18.920
If you wanted me dead, you should
have purchased a gun yourself.

42:18.983 --> 42:21.520
We can't let him destroy us.
Not now.

42:21.686 --> 42:23.825
Not only would it have been
more hospitable,

42:25.089 --> 42:27.865
it would have been more pragmatic.
You see, your Mr. Magnum

42:28.059 --> 42:30.539
doesn't have
the killer instinct.

42:32.763 --> 42:35.004
Beach boys generally don't.

42:36.434 --> 42:40.849
That's why they stay on the beach,
living off of lonely, wealthy women.

42:42.339 --> 42:45.013
Is that the kind of life you
wanted for yourself, Lauren?

42:45.342 --> 42:46.719
Thomas, shoot him.

42:46.877 --> 42:49.483
Save your breath.
He doesn't have it in him.

43:39.864 --> 43:41.741
Charlie isn't dead.

43:43.501 --> 43:45.378
I talked to him.
He's in Australia.

43:45.636 --> 43:46.979
I know.

43:47.872 --> 43:50.546
But Sam is dead now.
That's the important thing.

43:55.980 --> 43:58.358
You're going to take the money
and run away with Charlie?

43:58.415 --> 44:02.124
Nothing nearly so obvious.
The money stays here with Sam

44:02.953 --> 44:04.023
and you.

44:06.824 --> 44:08.997
Somehow I don't think that's
going to do us much good.

44:09.059 --> 44:10.538
No. Probably not.

44:10.928 --> 44:12.999
But it will help my story
a great deal.

44:15.065 --> 44:17.102
The story you've been
saving for the police.

44:17.668 --> 44:19.170
You'd like it.

44:19.503 --> 44:21.210
It's all about a
down-on-his-luck Pl

44:21.272 --> 44:23.479
who stumbled across a
very wealthy contractor

44:23.541 --> 44:25.714
who'd been bribing
building inspectors.

44:26.410 --> 44:27.616
Sam.

44:28.078 --> 44:31.651
About a contractor who wouldn't allow
himself to be blackmailed by a

44:31.982 --> 44:33.290
second-rate Pl.

44:34.285 --> 44:35.355
That's where I come in.

44:35.452 --> 44:38.922
And about a terrible fight which
escalated into a shootout,

44:39.490 --> 44:41.993
both men dead,
by each other's weapons.

44:49.400 --> 44:52.904
A routine investigation, a
respectable time for mourning,

44:53.537 --> 44:57.007
and you and Charlie can live happily
ever after off the empire Sam built.

44:59.610 --> 45:02.614
I'm afraid the one thing I
can't stand is long good-byes.

45:15.626 --> 45:17.230
I emptied it

45:18.629 --> 45:20.734
before you came downstairs.

45:21.498 --> 45:22.772
I'm sorry

45:25.769 --> 45:28.909
to have done something
so obvious.

45:29.807 --> 45:32.879
You haven't changed anything. It's
still your word against mine.

45:33.844 --> 45:35.585
Your gun killed Sam.

45:35.713 --> 45:38.819
Nobody ever saw us together.
Nobody will ever believe you.

45:39.016 --> 45:40.256
<i>I will.</i>

45:42.119 --> 45:43.291
Sam.

45:44.054 --> 45:48.434
It turns out I am as big a fool as you must
have thought I was when you married me.

45:50.961 --> 45:51.939
Sam.

45:51.996 --> 45:52.997
Please!

45:53.163 --> 45:55.006
Don't say any more.

45:56.834 --> 45:58.609
Even a fool has limits.

46:05.442 --> 46:06.614
You okay?

46:08.045 --> 46:09.046
Yeah.

46:13.083 --> 46:17.498
Yeah, but I'm almost sorry you called
me at the office for that little chat.

46:19.990 --> 46:21.094
Almost.

46:47.184 --> 46:50.495
<i>Looks like the second
storm isn't gonna hit after all.</i>
