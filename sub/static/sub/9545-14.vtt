The countdown is under way here
at Edwards Air Force Base.

00:04.070 --> 00:08.734
The new experimental rocket plane,
which was developed
by Altman Aerodynamics,

00:08.808 --> 00:13.040
<i>is scheduled to launch tomorrow morning</i>
<i>at 7:30 Pacific Time.</i>

00:13.113 --> 00:16.047
The four-man crew will be led
by a familiar face,

00:16.116 --> 00:19.381
astronaut and civilian test pilot,
Steven Wagner.

00:19.452 --> 00:22.114
<i>Wagner became a national hero</i>
<i>four years ago,</i>

00:22.188 --> 00:26.147
<i>when he made</i>
<i>a courageous emergency landing</i>
<i>in the space shuttle during reentry.</i>

00:26.226 --> 00:29.423
A national hero
in my very own living room.

00:29.496 --> 00:32.465
- But I'll never be a hero to you, will I?
- You were once.

00:33.666 --> 00:35.600
<i>[Steven]</i>
<i>Is this it?</i>
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

00:35.668 --> 00:39.866
<i>Between the Sheets:</i>
<i>TheJoanne Raphelson Story.</i>

00:39.939 --> 00:43.375
You wanna read it?
You're Chapter Five.
How many chapters are there?

00:43.443 --> 00:46.276
Fifteen.
Wow.
You've been a busy girl, Joanne.

00:46.346 --> 00:49.679
[Laughs]
And that's only Volume One.

00:49.749 --> 00:51.774
You really went into detail?

00:51.851 --> 00:54.411
My editor insisted on it.
The juicier, the better.

00:54.487 --> 00:58.423
<i>That's why I called you, Steve.</i>
<i>I didn't want you to be surprised.</i>

00:58.491 --> 01:00.982
I appreciate that, Joanne.

01:04.164 --> 01:07.600
I really do.

01:07.667 --> 01:12.764
So, has anyone seen this
new version yet?
Not yet.

01:12.839 --> 01:16.468
When do you hand it in?
Next week.
I'm still proofreading it.

01:16.543 --> 01:19.011
Cheers.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.741
Oh.
[Laughs]

01:21.815 --> 01:24.340
An olive, a cherry and an onion?
What do you call this?

01:24.417 --> 01:26.544
A Spacewalk.
It's my own recipe.

01:26.619 --> 01:29.383
It's a good name.
I feel like I'm flying.

01:29.456 --> 01:31.515
Oh.

01:31.591 --> 01:35.118
So, do you wanna read it?
I plan to.
That's why I'm here.

01:35.195 --> 01:38.164
But... I've changed my mind.
Oh.

01:38.231 --> 01:40.529
Hell, I've been a test pilot
for 15 years.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.194
I once landed a space shuttle
in the ocean.

01:43.269 --> 01:45.965
I think I can handle
whatever's in Chapter Five.

01:46.039 --> 01:48.132
So hand it in.
Hit me with your best shot.

01:48.208 --> 01:50.438
Thank you, Steve.

01:53.046 --> 01:55.344

01:58.518 --> 02:01.282
- I don't know.
I've been to Washington.
- Look at you.

02:01.354 --> 02:04.812
- I think I'm a lot safer in outer space.
- Damn, you're cute.

02:04.891 --> 02:07.655
<i>After this mission,</i>
<i>I'm going to sit down</i>
<i>and review my options.</i>

02:07.727 --> 02:12.755
<i>But I will say this: If I choose</i>
<i>to run for public office,</i>
<i>I'll treat it like any other mission.</i>

02:12.832 --> 02:14.993
I will fully commit,
and I will win.

Yeah.

Come on, Mr. Monk.
It would mean so much toJulie.

Yeah. L-I can't do it.
I'm sorry.

03:54.267 --> 03:57.236
L-I can't speak in public.
[Stammers]
See, that's not true.

03:57.303 --> 04:01.467
Remember when I first started working
for you, and you made that list
of all your fears and phobias?

04:01.541 --> 04:04.942
There were 103 things.
Public speaking wasn't one of them.

04:05.011 --> 04:07.104
There were a couple of things
that I didn't mention.

04:07.180 --> 04:10.308
I didn't want you to think I was weird.
Why don't you ask the captain?

04:10.383 --> 04:14.251

She found the body right here
couple hours ago.

Her name is, uh,
Joanne Raphelson, 36.

04:27.200 --> 04:30.294
Former Vegas showgirl.
The coroner just took the body.

04:30.370 --> 04:33.897
Said she's been dead for five days.
So that makes it, uh-

04:33.973 --> 04:37.602
Two days-
Wednesday morning.
Wednesday?

04:37.677 --> 04:40.737
Excuse me.
Why are we here?
She killed herself, right?

04:40.813 --> 04:43.714
<i>Uh, maybe.</i>
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

04:43.783 --> 04:46.946

I wanted to run 'em by you.

<i>I found a letter from</i>

A memoir called

Oh, yeah, yeah.
I get it. I got it.

05:06.706 --> 05:10.574
And a check for 50 grand,
which she has not deposited.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.634
Pretty weird time
to hang yourself, huh?

05:12.712 --> 05:17.046
Good work, sir.
You don't have to sound
so surprised, Randy.

05:17.116 --> 05:20.984
Oh. I'm not surprised.
I'm awestruck.

05:22.722 --> 05:26.419
Awestruck.
Well, don't be.
And that's an order.

05:26.492 --> 05:30.053
You're ordering me not to be awestruck?
That's right. Stand over there,
and don't be awestruck.

05:30.129 --> 05:32.063
Yes, sir.

05:35.435 --> 05:39.098
Anything else?
Uh, yeah.
Looks like her computer's missing.

05:39.172 --> 05:43.199
There's a power strip
with a surge protector,
a printer and no computer.

05:43.276 --> 05:45.506
Excuse me, sir.

05:45.578 --> 05:49.446
Sorry. I've never disobeyed
an order in my life.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.449
It's really good work.
It's awesome.

05:51.517 --> 05:54.008
Randy, why don't you go outside
and talk to the neighbors?

05:54.087 --> 05:57.614
Yes, sir.
It's awesome.

05:59.258 --> 06:03.695
So, am I right?
Something's not kosher.

06:09.569 --> 06:12.037
It's her driver's license.

06:12.105 --> 06:14.039
How tall you think that stool is?

06:15.241 --> 06:19.405
Mmm, about 18 inches?

06:20.813 --> 06:22.747
The rope's 7'6".

06:24.317 --> 06:28.310
But according to her license,
she's only 5'5".

06:28.388 --> 06:31.380
I'm 5'5".

06:31.457 --> 06:33.391
Step up.

06:36.696 --> 06:38.721
You're right.

06:40.666 --> 06:43.134
It doesn't add up.

06:44.404 --> 06:47.532
So, how long have you lived here?
Fifteen years.

06:47.607 --> 06:49.871
Maybe 14.
You know what?
My old lady'd know that.

06:49.942 --> 06:53.343
You can ask her when she gets back.
If she's sober.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.041
Mmm. Hey, you want
one of these? Nectarines?

06:56.115 --> 06:58.515
They're the perfect fruit.
There you go.
Oh. Okay.

07:00.286 --> 07:03.119
Now, why is the garage door
open again?

07:03.189 --> 07:06.124
- Benny, what did I tell you about this?
- I didn't open it.

07:06.192 --> 07:08.752
- Really? Well, then, who did?
- Maybe Donna did it.

07:08.828 --> 07:11.592
You ever think of that?
Your sister couldn't open up
a box of crayons.

07:11.664 --> 07:13.928
She's six years old,
for cryin' out loud.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.594
Mr. Cain, I just have
a few more questions.

07:16.669 --> 07:18.603
How well did you know
Miss Raphelson?

07:18.671 --> 07:22.198
Not as well as I wanted to,
if you get my drift.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.472
Hey, she was hot.
What a waste.

07:25.545 --> 07:27.911
Did she have any visitors last week?

07:27.980 --> 07:31.347
Uh, say, Tuesday or Wednesday?
Mm-mmm. No.

07:31.417 --> 07:34.284
Nobody. Nobody.
Not as far as I recall anyway.

07:34.353 --> 07:37.288
Oh, for crying- Now the-
Hector's out!

07:37.356 --> 07:40.291
- Benny, could you go get
your dog, please?
- Why should I?

07:40.359 --> 07:42.293
Because you opened up the garage.

07:42.361 --> 07:46.593
<i>Hey, smart guy,</i>
<i>this is a police officer, right?</i>

07:46.666 --> 07:50.295
I could have him lock you up.
You think about that.

this is, uh, Darrell Cain.

07:54.574 --> 07:58.237

- <i>[Disher] Mr. Cain says he was home</i>
<i>last week, but he didn't see</i>- 

08:02.715 --> 08:06.811
Excuse me. That box
is addressed toJoanne Raphelson.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.821
Yeah.
It was on her porch.

08:12.124 --> 08:14.649
Well, I'd heard she died.
I figured it was up for grabs.

08:14.727 --> 08:17.059
You can't just take mail
from somebody's porch.

08:17.129 --> 08:19.893
Yeah, you can if it's fruit.

08:19.966 --> 08:22.662
The law doesn't apply to fruit
because it's perishable.

08:22.735 --> 08:25.932
Actually, sir,
the law does apply to fruit.

08:27.373 --> 08:29.341
Are you eating one?
No.

08:29.408 --> 08:33.071
- I was just putting that back.
- Captain, you wanted
to see her phone records.

08:33.145 --> 08:35.078
Yeah.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.910
No calls at all on Tuesday

It's sort of a tradition.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.621
Well, congratulations
on your flight.

09:17.690 --> 09:21.126
Oh, hey, and, uh, congratulations
on that crash landing four years ago.

09:21.193 --> 09:23.787
Oh, and, uh, marrying
a figure skater.

09:23.863 --> 09:25.956
Yeah. Congratulations

Hey.

09:30.469 --> 09:32.562
Monk. I know that name.

09:32.638 --> 09:36.574
You're the detective,
the one who quit.

09:36.642 --> 09:39.202
No, l-I didn't quit, uh, exactly.

09:39.278 --> 09:41.678
It was a- It was
a kind of a leave of absence.

09:41.747 --> 09:45.183
It's nothing to be ashamed of, Mr. Monk.
Some people just can't
handle the pressure.

09:45.251 --> 09:48.687
L-l-l-I didn't quit.
Mr. Wagner, I'm sorry.

09:48.754 --> 09:53.782
My daughter just wrote
a school paper about you.
Good. I need all the P.R. I can get.

09:53.859 --> 09:56.589
She's not gonna believe
that I met you.
Do you mind if I take a picture?

09:56.662 --> 09:58.755
Not at all.
Thank you.

09:58.831 --> 10:00.765
I'm-I'm not a quitter.
I didn't quit.

10:00.833 --> 10:03.529
There were
extenuating circumstances.
There always are.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.629
The trick is not to let them stop us.

10:08.007 --> 10:11.807
- Captain, you said it was important.
- Oh, yeah. Um-

10:11.877 --> 10:13.868
Do you know a woman
named Joanne Raphelson?

10:16.048 --> 10:18.608
She's dead, isn't she?

10:18.684 --> 10:20.618
She finally did it.

10:22.021 --> 10:24.819
- You're not surprised.
- [Sighs]

10:24.890 --> 10:27.825
Joanne's been depressed for months.
For years, really.

10:27.893 --> 10:31.192
Was about to have a book published,
but somehow that made it worse.

10:31.263 --> 10:34.426
Like I was saying to Mr. Monk,
some people just can't
handle the pressure.

10:34.500 --> 10:37.298
It was a psychological discharge,
for God's sake.
It's only temporary.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.304
I plan on being reinstated.
He's so much better.

10:39.372 --> 10:43.308
How well did you know her?
Intimately.

10:43.376 --> 10:46.971
- When was the last time
you saw her?
- Five years ago.

10:47.046 --> 10:51.380
No, wait. Uh, she called you
on the phone last week.
That's true.

10:51.450 --> 10:56.786
She calls me once or twice a year
when she's lonely, depressed or drunk,
and sometimes all three.

10:56.856 --> 10:59.324
Steven? Honey,
we're cutting the cake.

10:59.392 --> 11:02.452
Look, uh, we can talk
about this tomorrow, okay?

11:02.528 --> 11:04.723
That's all right, Captain.
I have no secrets from my wife.

11:04.797 --> 11:09.564
Honey, these gentlemen are detectives.
Joanne Raphelson is dead.

11:09.635 --> 11:13.537
Oh, no. Poor girl.
I made a mistake, Captain.

11:13.606 --> 11:17.167
Five years ago.
Nicole knows all about it.

11:17.243 --> 11:20.371
I don't deserve this woman.

11:20.446 --> 11:23.074
Excuse me, ma'am.
What is that you're drinking?

11:23.149 --> 11:25.583
It's called a Spacewalk.

11:25.651 --> 11:27.619
My husband invented it.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.917
Is-Is-Is that an olive?

11:29.989 --> 11:31.923
And an onion and a cherry.

11:31.991 --> 11:34.016
It's my claim to fame.
Would you like one?

11:34.093 --> 11:37.426
No, thank you. Mr. Wagner,
I was reading about your flight.

11:37.496 --> 11:39.657
They said they almost
had to cancel the liftoff.

11:39.732 --> 11:41.700
You were running late?
That's true.

11:41.767 --> 11:44.463
I got lost on my way to Edwards.
Can you believe it?

11:44.537 --> 11:47.267
You-You got lost?
I tried a different shortcut.

11:47.339 --> 11:51.867
L-l-I guess I'm a better navigator
in the sky than I am on the highways.

11:51.944 --> 11:54.913
Congressman,
glad you could make it.
Steve!

11:54.980 --> 11:59.440
Hey, when are we gonna have
that talk about your future?
The sooner, the better.

11:59.518 --> 12:01.850
Will you excuse us?
Uh, my friends are waiting.

12:01.921 --> 12:03.855
We can talk about this
some other time?
Absolutely.

12:03.923 --> 12:05.891
Great.
It was nice to meet you.

12:05.958 --> 12:08.449
Nice to meet you.

12:08.527 --> 12:10.518
He's the guy.

12:11.530 --> 12:15.159
Who's the guy?
The astronaut.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.168
He killed her.

12:17.236 --> 12:21.297
Somebody made that exact same drink
atJoanne Raphelson's house
before she died.

12:21.373 --> 12:24.274
Monk, it's not possible.
He was in space.

12:24.343 --> 12:28.370
He did it.
Outer space, Monk.

12:28.447 --> 12:31.314
He was on TV.
He was orbiting the Earth.

12:31.383 --> 12:34.318
You gotta admit
it's a pretty good alibi.

12:36.522 --> 12:39.958
He- He's the guy.

12:51.670 --> 12:55.231
Monk, 99 times out of a hundred,
I am in your corner.

12:55.307 --> 13:00.745
But I just can't see it.
Steve Wagner is a national hero.
It's true, Mr. Monk.

13:00.813 --> 13:03.839
He was on the cover
of <i>Time</i> magazine.
Actually, it was <i>Newsweek.</i>

13:03.916 --> 13:07.750
Actually, it was both. Now, look,
we need to tread carefully here.

13:07.820 --> 13:10.550
First off, there's no motive.
The wife knew about the affair.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.989
A lot of people did.
But it wasn't just the affair.

13:13.058 --> 13:16.027
We just talked toJoanne Raphelson's
editor in New York.

13:16.095 --> 13:18.188
She was about to hand in
her next draft,

13:18.264 --> 13:20.892
which contained a couple
of real bombshells.

13:20.966 --> 13:25.266
- Like?
- Like, which of her ex-boyfriends
beat her up five years ago.

13:25.337 --> 13:27.396
Somebody put her in the hospital.

13:27.473 --> 13:30.704
She had a concussion, right?
Mm-hmm.

13:30.776 --> 13:32.801
And you think Steve Wagner's involved?

13:34.480 --> 13:36.971
I just don't believe it.
I'm sorry, Mr. Monk.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.577
Look, Wagner wants
to run for office.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.145
A story like that would bury him.

13:44.223 --> 13:47.681
Okay. Maybe you found a motive.
Maybe.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.160
But it doesn't matter,
and I'll tell you why.

13:50.229 --> 13:53.323
Because your suspect, Monk,
was in outer space.

13:53.399 --> 13:55.663
He wasn't on this planet.
It's true.

13:55.734 --> 13:58.726
Julie and I watched it
on television.
The whole world was watching.

13:58.804 --> 14:01.500
He took off on Monday,
and he landed on Friday.

14:02.575 --> 14:06.443
Here's the case file.
Now, the coroner
is 100% sure.

14:06.512 --> 14:11.074
He is certain thatJoanne Raphelson
died of ligature strangulation
on Wednesday morning...

14:11.150 --> 14:13.243
while your man was in space.

14:14.987 --> 14:19.356
Now, maybe we should take a minute
and see if we can think
of a better alibi.

14:42.147 --> 14:46.379
It's a pretty good alibi.
Yep.

14:46.452 --> 14:48.647
She had drugs in her system?
Barbiturates.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.746
Yeah. Coroner said
she took some pills.

14:50.823 --> 14:54.589
They didn't work,
she went to Plan "B" and dangled herself.
It happens all the time.

14:54.660 --> 14:57.458
But you said yourself,
the crime scene didn't look kosher.

14:57.529 --> 15:02.660
Yeah, Monk,
what I'm saying is it might be murder,
but it wasn't him.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.930
Captain, I think Monk's right.

15:05.004 --> 15:07.063
Thank you!
Reinforcements.

15:07.139 --> 15:11.269
I think I know how Wagner did it.
Okay, this is the ship.

15:11.343 --> 15:13.334
And let's pretend this globe
represents the Earth.

15:13.412 --> 15:16.404
That's a globe.
It does represent the Earth.

15:16.482 --> 15:20.384
Right. Okay.

15:20.452 --> 15:23.910
Here's what happened.
The first part was easy.
He takes off.

15:23.989 --> 15:27.083
[Mimicking Engines Firing]

15:31.897 --> 15:36.994
As he passes over San Francisco,
he activates the escape pod.

15:37.069 --> 15:39.560
Well, wait. Uh, wait.

15:39.638 --> 15:43.267
Was there an escape pod
on the ship?
No, not officially.

15:43.342 --> 15:46.436
But I think he smuggled one on.
Mm-hmm. And where did he get it-
the escape pod?

15:46.512 --> 15:48.946
He built it.

15:49.014 --> 15:51.278
Yeah, out of a kit.
In his basement.

15:52.351 --> 15:57.448
He's resourceful.
Anyway, splashdown.

15:57.523 --> 15:59.889
Climbs out of the pod,
makes his way to her house,

15:59.959 --> 16:05.295
kills her,
climbs back onto the pod,
fires up the engines, back in space.

16:05.364 --> 16:09.232
- Thank you, Randy. That's-
- It's just a theory.

16:09.301 --> 16:12.930
I don't think so. No.
I've heard theories before,

16:13.005 --> 16:15.974
and, uh,
they don't sound like that.

16:16.041 --> 16:18.009
<i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

16:20.546 --> 16:22.537
It's him.
It's Steve Wagner.

16:24.149 --> 16:27.778
Hello? Yes.

16:29.221 --> 16:33.385

16:40.165 --> 16:42.565
Okay, great.
I'll see you then.

16:42.634 --> 16:46.365
Steve Wagner is speaking
atJulie's school for Career Day.

16:46.438 --> 16:50.738
Wait. You invited him?
Yeah, I met his P.R. Person
last night as we were leaving.

16:50.809 --> 16:53.972
Natalie, he killed his ex-girlfriend!

16:54.046 --> 16:56.537
Monk, maybe you should go too.

16:56.615 --> 17:00.016
You think the guy's involved?
It'll give you a chance to feel him out.

17:02.788 --> 17:05.018
Fine. Okay.
I'll do it.

17:07.492 --> 17:09.654
You're both coming?

17:09.728 --> 17:12.162
I'm gonna be class mom of the year!

17:13.165 --> 17:16.031
When I was your age,
I was a Boy Scout.

17:16.101 --> 17:18.035
Who here knows the Boy Scout motto?

17:18.103 --> 17:20.469
[All]
Be prepared!
That's right.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.632
<i>And that motto saved my life.</i>

17:22.708 --> 17:25.472
<i>Because when the landing gear</i>
<i>didn't come down, I was prepared.</i>

17:25.544 --> 17:27.603
I knew what I had to do.

17:28.714 --> 17:32.616
I went around Florida-
good-bye, Florida-

17:32.684 --> 17:37.553

And you weren't even scared?

17:39.792 --> 17:42.955
No, I wasn't scared.
I was terrified!

17:43.028 --> 17:46.623
- [Chuckling]
- People called me a hero.

17:46.698 --> 17:49.223
<i>But anybody</i>- 
<i>anybody could have done that.</i>

17:49.301 --> 17:54.261
You or you or you or you or...

17:56.141 --> 17:58.871
you or you.

18:00.012 --> 18:03.448
Being brave is being afraid of something,
but doing it anyway.

18:05.484 --> 18:07.918
What are you gonna do next?

18:07.986 --> 18:11.820
Tomorrow, I'm testing a brand-new jet
for the air force called the F% A-22 Raptor.

It's the most advanced fighter
in the world.

[Chuckling]
Before I go,

18:23.535 --> 18:27.301
I brought some official Steve Wagner
laser pointers for all you kids.

18:27.372 --> 18:29.932
There you go. Take one,
pass them back.

18:30.008 --> 18:35.002
Well, I had a great time. And remember,
what does Steve Wagner want you to do?

<i>Thank you so much, Mr. Wagner.</i>
<i>Wasn't he great?</i>
<i>Let's give him a hand.</i>

is Mr. Adrian Monk,

19:39.845 --> 19:41.836
I'm Adrian Monk.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.010
Who wants to be a detective
when they grow up?

19:51.990 --> 19:53.981
What about you?
No.

19:54.059 --> 19:56.425
No?

19:56.495 --> 20:00.625
Everybody in your row
has their hand up, so-

20:01.633 --> 20:07.367
If you put your hand up,
um, it would be a perfect row.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.468
Put your hand up!

20:19.117 --> 20:23.577
- Where's your gun?
- Um, I, uh-

20:23.655 --> 20:28.092
- I don't- I don't have one.
- You can't carry one
'cause you had a breakdown.

20:28.160 --> 20:31.721
<i>[Chuckling]</i>
Oh, well, uh-

20:31.797 --> 20:35.062
- <i>Julie said you're afraid of milk.</i>
- [Chuckling]

20:35.133 --> 20:39.069
Well, everybody's, uh-
everybody's afraid of something, right?

20:39.137 --> 20:43.733
- Julie said you're afraid of everything.
- Mr. Monk, l- I really-

20:43.809 --> 20:46.243
<i>Have you ever caught a</i> real <i>killer?</i>

20:46.311 --> 20:49.439
Oh, yes. Oh.

20:49.514 --> 20:52.950
Yes, I've caught a lot of killers.

20:53.018 --> 20:58.581
Some killers are very smart,
and some are very powerful.

20:58.657 --> 21:03.720
Some are even famous.
They don't think
they will ever be caught.

21:03.795 --> 21:07.026
But in the end,

21:07.099 --> 21:09.829
they- they are always caught.

21:09.901 --> 21:11.892
And I'll tell you why.

21:13.338 --> 21:19.299
Because the police
can make mistakes.

21:19.378 --> 21:23.178
I make mistakes all the time.

21:23.248 --> 21:26.217
But, uh- But-

21:26.285 --> 21:28.617
[Chuckling]

21:30.355 --> 21:36.089
See, a-a killer has to be,
uh- has to-

21:37.696 --> 21:40.961
[Chuckling]

21:42.334 --> 21:45.735
A killer has to be perfect,
and, uh,

21:48.073 --> 21:50.405
nobody's perfect.

21:56.048 --> 21:58.414
The first police officers appeared...

21:58.483 --> 22:02.817
in, an- in ancient Rome in 200 B.C.

22:02.888 --> 22:05.823
They were called centurions.

22:05.891 --> 22:08.758
In many ways,
they were like our modern police force.

22:08.827 --> 22:11.261
It was their job to- to-

22:11.330 --> 22:13.890
[Chuckling]
To enforce laws...

22:13.965 --> 22:17.560
and to- and to maintain order.

22:17.636 --> 22:21.197
Uh, they were, uh,
chosen for their-

22:21.273 --> 22:23.264
<i>[Chuckling Continues]</i>

22:36.988 --> 22:39.218
Here, Mr. Monk.
Drink that.

22:39.291 --> 22:43.193
Are you okay?
Oh.

22:43.261 --> 22:45.661
That was a good, good speech.

22:45.731 --> 22:48.097
I think the kids learned a lot.

22:48.166 --> 22:50.566
Yeah. They're-
They're still laughing.

22:50.635 --> 22:53.900
Well, they'll have to stop soon.
Period's almost over.

22:53.972 --> 22:57.669
Oh, I am such a-
What do you call it?

22:57.743 --> 23:01.770
Wuss. No, Mr. Monk,
you are not a wuss.

23:01.847 --> 23:04.475
Well, I'm not a man.
I know that.

23:04.549 --> 23:09.111
I'm a mutant.
I'm half man, half wuss.

23:09.187 --> 23:11.553
I'm a "muss."
Here you are,
our brave centurion.

23:11.623 --> 23:14.456
I liked your speech,
especially the little dance number
at the end.

23:14.526 --> 23:16.721
Those laser pointers
can be very dangerous.

23:16.795 --> 23:19.457
Yeah, they're a real menace.
I hear you've been checking up on me-

23:19.531 --> 23:22.022
calling Joanne's family,
her publisher,
turning over rocks.

23:22.100 --> 23:26.093
If you want to talk to me,
let's talk right now,
man to "muss."

23:30.642 --> 23:32.837
Did you hit her?
Hit who?

23:32.911 --> 23:36.813
Joanne. Did you hit her so hard
that she woke up in the hospital?

23:36.882 --> 23:38.975
I wouldn't repeat that, Mr. Monk.
That's slander.

23:39.050 --> 23:41.644
Besides, who would believe it?

23:41.720 --> 23:46.851
But that's why you killed her, isn't it?
Because she was about to go public.

23:46.925 --> 23:50.122
She was about to tell the truth
about you.

23:51.196 --> 23:54.654
You're a sad little man.
I can't believe you and I
breathe the same air.

23:54.733 --> 23:59.261
I was on a spaceship, Mr. Monk,
circling the Earth with my crew.

23:59.337 --> 24:02.033
Why doesn't that satisfy you?

24:02.107 --> 24:05.201
Am I making you nervous?

24:05.277 --> 24:08.713
Never. You know why?

24:08.780 --> 24:10.714
[Snaps Fingers]
See?

24:10.782 --> 24:13.376
You flinched.
See, you're a flincher.

24:15.253 --> 24:17.949
You'll never stop me,
because when the chips are down,

24:18.023 --> 24:21.891
when it really counts,
you are always going to flinch.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.485
<i>[Chattering]</i>

24:24.563 --> 24:26.997
Sir, sorry to interrupt.
We have to go.

24:34.673 --> 24:38.439
Oh, my God.
You were right.

24:38.510 --> 24:43.573
He killed her.
That was almost a confession.

24:43.648 --> 24:45.741
But how?

24:45.817 --> 24:47.944
How did he do it?

24:53.058 --> 24:56.653
I mean, they were just toys-
little red flashlights-

24:56.728 --> 24:59.458
but I was terrified.

25:00.465 --> 25:02.729
I wanted to scream.

25:02.801 --> 25:06.100
What-What did you do?

25:06.171 --> 25:08.162
I screamed.

25:09.875 --> 25:11.866
Least, I heard screaming.

25:11.943 --> 25:13.934
I'm pretty sure it was me.

25:14.012 --> 25:16.879
Adrian, you were giving a speech
in front of a group of people.

25:16.948 --> 25:20.907
That's real progress.
No, really, I'm very proud of you.

25:20.986 --> 25:23.284
Yeah.

25:23.355 --> 25:26.017
You're never going to be
completely free of fear.

25:26.091 --> 25:31.085
You can't expect that.
But real courage is being afraid
of something and doing it anyway.

25:31.162 --> 25:33.756
No.
What?

25:33.832 --> 25:37.893
Steve Wagner said
the exact same thing.

25:39.304 --> 25:42.899
Really?
The-The astronaut.

25:45.443 --> 25:47.877
Doctor-
Killed his girlfriend.

25:47.946 --> 25:51.074
Wh-Wh-Which I do not condone.
It's indefensible, of course.

25:53.118 --> 25:56.645
See, now I'm afraid all the time.

25:56.721 --> 26:00.919
I'm so tired of being afraid.

26:00.992 --> 26:03.483
Adrian, I'm anxious to talk
about your phobias.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.827
We talked about aversion therapy.
[Mutters]

26:06.898 --> 26:10.265
Okay. Let's- Let's- Let's do it.
Let's do it right now.

26:10.335 --> 26:12.667
Okay, okay, all right.
Here we go.

26:12.737 --> 26:15.638
Which of your fears
would you like to work on first?

26:16.641 --> 26:20.236
Glaciers.
Glaciers.

26:20.312 --> 26:23.145
No. Rodeos.

26:23.214 --> 26:25.148
Ah, glaciers.
Glaciers.

26:25.216 --> 26:29.778
W-W-Wait.
Why don't we just start
with a basic one- fear of heights?

26:29.854 --> 26:31.947
Ah, okay. Heights.
Heights.

26:32.023 --> 26:34.753
Let's do it.
Okay, good.
Let's get up on the roof right now.

26:34.826 --> 26:38.125
Okay, wait, wait.
All right. Wait. Sit.
I'll sit.

26:38.196 --> 26:42.530
Sit down.
Okay, I'm down.
I'm sitting down.

26:42.601 --> 26:47.868
I'm not- I'm not ready...
for that.

26:47.939 --> 26:51.204
Uh, let's-

26:51.276 --> 26:54.609
Let's just build up to it gradually.

26:55.680 --> 26:59.275
Here's what-
Why don't we sit here...

26:59.351 --> 27:04.345
and, uh, name really tall things?

27:04.422 --> 27:06.413
I'll go first.

27:07.959 --> 27:09.950
The Sears Tower.

27:11.596 --> 27:14.724
Mmm. Oh,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

27:14.799 --> 27:17.859
Mmm. No. That-
That's too tall.

27:17.936 --> 27:20.234
Uh, not- not the Sears Tower.

27:20.305 --> 27:22.500
Just a regular Sears, maybe.

27:23.842 --> 27:27.676
Just a regular Sears.
Mm-hmm.

27:27.746 --> 27:32.410
Department store.
Adrian, why don't we work on
your phobias another time, okay?

27:35.453 --> 27:37.444
Okay.

27:39.791 --> 27:41.725
[Sighs]

27:41.793 --> 27:44.990
When l-When I look at a man-

27:45.063 --> 27:48.794
a real man like Steve Wagner-

27:51.703 --> 27:54.001
I just feel weak.

27:54.072 --> 27:56.506
I just feel so inadequate.

27:58.076 --> 28:03.139
I know he's guilty,
but I'll never be able to prove it.

28:05.216 --> 28:08.982
Adrian, Steve Wagner
is a human being,

28:09.054 --> 28:14.014
and if he's guilty, I know something
he's very much afraid of.

28:14.092 --> 28:16.356
What's that?

28:16.428 --> 28:18.623
You.

28:35.647 --> 28:38.810
She's in the house.

28:38.883 --> 28:44.446
He is up there in space...

28:44.522 --> 28:46.820
circling the Earth.

28:46.891 --> 28:48.825
Maybe he had an accomplice.
No.

28:48.893 --> 28:50.952
We have statements
from all of the neighbors.

28:51.029 --> 28:53.725
There were no visitors, no cars.

28:53.798 --> 28:56.699
She was definitely alone.

28:56.768 --> 29:01.671
Somehow, he killed her
from up there.

29:01.740 --> 29:05.073
Well, she collected a lot of dolls.

29:05.143 --> 29:07.236
Lot of really ugly dolls.

29:07.312 --> 29:10.475
Natalie, holes.

29:10.548 --> 29:12.641
How did we miss that?

29:13.752 --> 29:15.743
They were drilled recently.

29:15.820 --> 29:19.586
<i>So? She wasn't killed out there.</i>
<i>She was killed in here.</i>

29:19.657 --> 29:24.287
She was <i>found</i> in there,

29:24.362 --> 29:27.923
but she could have been killed
someplace else.

29:27.999 --> 29:30.695
<i>[Clanging]</i>

29:38.877 --> 29:41.675
- Speak of the devil.
- Sorry. I didn't know anyone was here.

29:41.746 --> 29:44.613
Are you looking for something?

29:44.682 --> 29:48.174
I wanted a flower
from her garden.

29:48.253 --> 29:50.244
She loved this garden.

29:52.223 --> 29:54.214
I cared for the girl.
I won't deny that.

29:54.292 --> 29:58.160
You came a long way
to pick a flower.
<i>Actually, I was heading up here anyway.</i>

29:58.229 --> 30:00.561
I have a test flight at Paxton
in a couple of hours.

30:00.632 --> 30:04.068
Now it's your turn.
What are you doing here?
I'm investigating Joanne's murder.

30:04.135 --> 30:06.296
Her suicide.

30:06.371 --> 30:09.807
It was murder.
I think we both know that.

30:09.874 --> 30:14.675
<i>Come on, man.!</i>
<i>Are you deaf? Please,</i>
<i>Just close the damn garage door.!</i>

30:14.746 --> 30:16.737
Well, I did, three times!

30:16.815 --> 30:19.045
Right! Well, guess what?
It's open again!

30:19.117 --> 30:21.142
<i>Well, maybe it's broke.!</i>
<i>It ain't broke.!</i>

30:21.219 --> 30:25.053
It's brand-new!
Holy son of a- Look at this!

30:25.123 --> 30:27.648
<i>Look at him.!</i>
<i>He looks just like</i>- 

30:27.725 --> 30:29.716
Hey, you know what?
I think that is.
Who?

30:29.794 --> 30:32.854
The-Who? The-
He's the- the guy,
the- the spaceman from TV.

30:32.931 --> 30:36.526
He's famous!
Go get the camera, would ya?
Stay with your brother!

30:36.601 --> 30:39.331
Go get the camera!
Uh, excuse me.

30:39.404 --> 30:42.737
Excuse me.
[Stammering]
Excuse me.

30:42.807 --> 30:45.901
Uh, you're-
You're famous, right?

30:45.977 --> 30:49.538
You're that, uh, Steve Walenski?
Wagner. Steven Wagner.

30:49.614 --> 30:51.741
Wagner! That's-
I knew that.

30:51.816 --> 30:54.011
Wagner!
You're the space cowboy, right?

30:54.085 --> 30:58.021
Oh, man!
You're that dude that landed
the space shuttle when it was on fire!

30:58.089 --> 31:00.523
That's correct.
I lost 10 bucks on that.

31:00.592 --> 31:03.026
Sorry to disappoint you.
Would you excuse us?

31:03.094 --> 31:06.188
We're in the middle of something.
Could you excuse us, please?

31:09.300 --> 31:11.768
You folks live across the street?
Is that right?

31:11.836 --> 31:15.237
How-Yeah, that's us.
Right over here.

31:15.306 --> 31:17.536
That's right. How are you, man?
Hey, good to meet you.

31:17.609 --> 31:19.634
I'm- I'm Darrell.
This is my daughter Donna here,

31:19.711 --> 31:22.874
and, well, this is Benny.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

31:22.947 --> 31:25.575
What the hell are you doing here?
Would you-

31:25.650 --> 31:30.713
You're curious, aren't you?
That's the best thing a boy can have-
curiosity.

31:30.788 --> 31:33.382
I was friends with the lady
that lived here.

31:33.458 --> 31:35.619
Oh, man.
That's a shame.

31:35.693 --> 31:38.821
That's-That's heartbreaking.

31:38.897 --> 31:42.196
Could we get a picture?
I can do better than that.

31:42.267 --> 31:46.397
I'm flight-testing a brand-new jet
in a couple of hours.
How'd you like to come and watch?

31:47.472 --> 31:50.873
Bring the whole family.
Be my guests.
Are you-you kidding me?

31:50.942 --> 31:52.933
They wouldn't mind?
You have every right to be there.

31:53.011 --> 31:57.448
- You're a taxpayer, right?
- Yeah. Sales tax.

31:57.515 --> 32:02.418
Could we come too?
I'm a big aviation buff- fan.

32:02.487 --> 32:04.921
<i>[Natalie] So true.</i>
<i>[Monk]</i>
<i>Fan</i>- <i>Fan or buff.</i>

32:04.989 --> 32:06.957
Such a fanatic. Just-
I love airplanes.

32:07.025 --> 32:08.993
Crazy about the, uh-
Can't get enough of'em.

32:09.060 --> 32:12.257
- The-The takeoff.
- <i>[Monk] And the wings and all.</i>

32:12.330 --> 32:14.525
<i>[Natalie] And the landing.</i>
<i>[Monk]</i>
<i>What do you call it? The rudder.</i>

32:15.833 --> 32:17.767
You wouldn't mind if we come,
do you?

32:19.537 --> 32:22.529
<i>[Aircraft Passes Overhead]</i>

32:23.808 --> 32:26.299
<i>[Wagner]</i>
<i>We're talking about</i>
<i>state-of-the-art technology here.</i>

32:26.377 --> 32:28.777
The most advanced warplanes
ever built.

32:28.846 --> 32:32.839
Some of these planes are prototypes.
That means nobody's ever flown 'em.

32:32.917 --> 32:35.613
<i>[Darrell] It sounds dangerous.</i>
<i>[Wagner]</i>
<i>It can be dangerous.</i>

32:35.687 --> 32:39.020
Then why do you do it?
If I didn't do it, Benny,
somebody else would.

32:39.090 --> 32:41.058
And where's the fun in that?

32:41.125 --> 32:44.788
Now, you kids will love this.
This is a flight simulator.

32:44.862 --> 32:47.626
It's kind of like
a 30-million-dollar video game.
Cool!

32:47.699 --> 32:49.690
Want to check it out?
Okay.

32:49.767 --> 32:52.327
You grown-ups stay here.
We'll be right back.

32:52.403 --> 32:54.598
Captain Savo, you're in charge.

32:57.875 --> 33:01.675
He is good people.
Yeah, he's good people.

33:01.746 --> 33:03.714
Hey, how well you know him?

33:03.781 --> 33:07.012
Well enough to wonder
what he's doing.
Let's go in.

33:09.687 --> 33:12.485
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's a little dark in there.
No, just-

33:12.557 --> 33:14.889
Let's just wait out here
for a while.

33:16.794 --> 33:20.025
<i>Paulie, why is this garage door open?</i>

33:20.098 --> 33:22.931
Don't know, Sarge.
Opened by itself.
Maybe we installed it wrong.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.333
[Scoffs]
I got the same problem
with my garage.

33:25.403 --> 33:27.337
It's like an epidemic.

33:29.374 --> 33:32.673
Natalie, I know how he did it.

33:32.744 --> 33:36.441
I know how he killed her!
It's all about the garage doors!

33:36.514 --> 33:37.913
It is?
Yes!

33:37.982 --> 33:39.916
- Dad!
- Daddy!
[Crying]

33:39.984 --> 33:42.578
- Where's Mr. Wagner?
- He left. He said
he was late for something.

33:42.653 --> 33:44.587
What's wrong, sweetie?

33:44.655 --> 33:47.920
The astronaut took her doll.
He took her doll?

33:47.992 --> 33:51.894
That's it! Natalie,
it's all about the doll!

33:51.963 --> 33:56.866
You said it was all about
the garage door!
It's about the doll and the garage doors!

33:56.934 --> 33:58.925
It's about both!

34:03.274 --> 34:06.937
Mr. Cain, where did you
get that doll?

34:07.011 --> 34:09.741
L-
Come on.
You stole it, didn't you?

34:09.813 --> 34:11.940
It was in a box
sitting on Joanne's front porch,

34:12.016 --> 34:14.813
and you took it, just like you took
the Fruit of the Month box.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.978
It was sitting there
for three days, all right?

34:17.054 --> 34:19.489
I figured she wasn't home.
You're a horrible neighbor!

34:19.556 --> 34:22.424
<i>Daddy.!</i>
<i>[Sobbing Continues]</i>

34:22.493 --> 34:25.326
Honey, it's gonna be all right.

34:25.396 --> 34:27.455
<i>I wanna go home, Daddy.</i>
It's gonna be okay.

34:27.532 --> 34:30.295
It's gonna be all right.
Sweetie, come on.

34:30.368 --> 34:32.460
<i>Huh?</i>

34:35.139 --> 34:39.098
This is Captain Savo.
I just lost two of my civilians.
Notify the law enforcement desk.

34:40.645 --> 34:42.909
Okay, thank you.
Captain's on his way.

34:42.980 --> 34:45.972
We have to find Wagner
before he gets rid of that doll.

34:46.050 --> 34:48.643
Monk, I don't understand.

34:48.719 --> 34:51.152
Here's what happened.
Before he left,

34:51.222 --> 34:53.656
<i>Wagner must have</i>
<i>gone toJoanne's house.</i>

34:53.724 --> 34:55.658
<i>He drugged her,</i>
<i>but not enough to kill her.</i>

34:55.726 --> 34:58.695
<i>Just enough to knock her out</i>
<i>for a couple of days.</i>

34:58.763 --> 35:02.358
Then he built a machine-
a murder machine-

35:02.433 --> 35:06.028
<i>a machine that would hang her on Wednesday,</i>
<i>long after he was gone.</i>

35:06.104 --> 35:09.972
What kind of machine?
A garage door opener.

35:10.041 --> 35:12.509
<i>He left her there drugged,</i>
<i>probably tied up,</i>

35:12.577 --> 35:16.377
<i>and then took off into space</i>
<i>with the whole world watching.</i>

35:20.318 --> 35:23.583
Mr. Monk,
what are you doing?

35:23.654 --> 35:25.588
I don't know.

35:25.656 --> 35:28.056
<i>They're at Ramp Two.</i>
<i>He's handling the missile.</i>

35:28.126 --> 35:30.060
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Those are missiles!

35:30.128 --> 35:32.426
Th-Th-They could be nuclear weapons!

35:32.497 --> 35:34.624
Then stop me,
for the love of God.

35:34.699 --> 35:38.897
It's all right.
[Muttering]
<i>[Alarm Blaring]</i>

35:41.372 --> 35:44.933
I don't understand.
She died on Wednesday.
How did he activate the machine?

35:45.009 --> 35:49.571
It was so simple,
it was brilliant.
He used a remote control.

35:49.647 --> 35:52.810
<i>He taped it or glued it down</i>
<i>so it stayed on.</i>

35:52.884 --> 35:56.718
<i>Then he put the remote control</i>
<i>inside one of those dolls.</i>

35:56.787 --> 35:59.881
<i>Then he mailed it to her own house</i>
<i>second-day mail.</i>

35:59.957 --> 36:02.050
<i>Second-day mail.</i>
<i>Wednesday morning.!</i>

36:02.126 --> 36:04.060
Exactly.
It was like a time bomb.

36:04.128 --> 36:08.064
- <i>The mailman delivered the remote control,</i>
<i>put it on the front porch.</i>
- <i>[Beeps]</i>

36:08.132 --> 36:11.898
<i>On the other side of that door,</i>
<i>she was being strangled.</i>

36:11.969 --> 36:16.668
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>But they found her in the living room.</i>

36:16.741 --> 36:19.107
After he landed,
Wagner went back to her house.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.941
He dismantled the machine
and moved her body
into the other room.

36:22.013 --> 36:24.277
It was a perfect plan,
except for one thing.

36:24.348 --> 36:26.578
<i>The doll was missing.!</i>

36:26.651 --> 36:30.747
<i>He must have panicked.</i>
<i>He went back there again</i>
<i>today to find it.</i>

36:30.821 --> 36:33.881
<i>He knows that remote</i>
<i>can tie him to the murder.</i>

36:33.958 --> 36:37.519
His fingerprints are all over it.
Excuse me. Hi.

36:37.595 --> 36:40.257
Hey, nice ride.
Hi. Listen, we're looking
for Steve Wagner.

36:40.331 --> 36:43.425
He may be on the flight line.
I think they just cleared him
for takeoff.

36:43.501 --> 36:45.731
Great. We'd love to watch.
Which way?

36:45.803 --> 36:49.739
You can't miss him.
He's in a brand-new F% A-22.

36:49.807 --> 36:54.767
Oh. Uh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Hi. Hi. Hello again.

36:54.845 --> 36:58.440
Could you settle a bet?
My friend and I were wondering if, uh,

36:58.516 --> 37:03.180
somebody could drop anything
out of the cockpit of an F% A-22?

37:03.254 --> 37:05.950
Of course, uh, I say no way.
Of course you can!

37:06.023 --> 37:09.754
Like what?
Uh, you know, a Japanese doll.

37:09.827 --> 37:14.059
- About this big.
- Well, there's an air lock,
like a chute,

37:14.131 --> 37:16.065
to drop flares
and emergency transmitters.

37:16.133 --> 37:18.294
I owe you one. Go figure.
Thank you!

37:18.369 --> 37:20.564
<i>[Monk] That's unbelievable.</i>
<i>You win that one.</i>
Wait a second.

about Mr. Wagner...

41:04.929 --> 41:07.056
