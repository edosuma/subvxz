WEBVTT

00:26.860 --> 00:29.097
(door clanging)

00:29.130 --> 00:31.499
Double-double,
no cheese, grilled onions,

00:31.532 --> 00:32.666
fries and a shake.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.202
That's a hell of
a last supper.

00:34.235 --> 00:36.237
Well, Bledsoe,

00:36.270 --> 00:39.240
when it's your turn,
you'll get to pick.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.141
(door shuts)

00:50.118 --> 00:51.285
There a problem?

00:51.319 --> 00:53.354
There's no ketchup.

00:56.657 --> 00:59.093
They always forget the ketchup.

00:59.127 --> 01:00.528
I'll see what
I can do, John.

01:06.667 --> 01:09.570
(phone line ringing,
clock ticking)

01:10.771 --> 01:12.273
MAN:
FBI, Los Angeles.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.408
Yes, my name
is Dr. Henry Stanley.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.244
I'm a psychiatrist
in Los Angeles.

01:16.277 --> 01:18.112
I have important information.

01:18.146 --> 01:21.349
I believe John Curtis
may be innocent.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.418
(whistle blowing)

01:24.452 --> 01:25.486
Good energy, nice hustle!

01:26.620 --> 01:28.422
Is this tie
really necessary?

01:28.456 --> 01:29.890
All aspects of the
game are controlled

01:29.923 --> 01:32.160
by forces: look
sharp, play sharp.

01:32.193 --> 01:35.263
How about this annoying
athletic supporter?

01:35.296 --> 01:36.764
That's for the
players, Larry.

01:36.797 --> 01:37.765
Oh.

01:37.798 --> 01:38.799
(blowing whistle)

01:38.832 --> 01:39.867
All right,
keep it going!

01:39.900 --> 01:41.302
I want to see
you sweat!

01:41.335 --> 01:42.303
Just relax, now.

01:42.336 --> 01:43.171
What's the worst
that can happen?

01:43.204 --> 01:45.139
We lose for the
ten-to-the-23rd time?

01:45.173 --> 01:46.407
It's not losing
that worries me.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.275
- It's just...
- What?

01:47.308 --> 01:48.809
Nice form, Peter.

01:48.842 --> 01:51.645
I think there's something
I need to show you.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.581
A cautionary tale
about my coaching.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.883
In the interest of all candor...

01:57.451 --> 01:58.686
CHARLIE:
Oh, you never told me

01:58.719 --> 02:00.354
you coached collegiate
basketball before.

02:00.388 --> 02:02.423
Well, it was
intramural league.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.325
They did let us play in
the gym here for the finals.

02:04.358 --> 02:05.459
- What?!
- How'd that go?

02:05.493 --> 02:06.494
Are you nuts?!

02:06.527 --> 02:07.595
Uh... they called

02:07.628 --> 02:09.430
the game early
for a science fair.

02:09.463 --> 02:10.231
Yeah, elementary

02:10.264 --> 02:12.733
schoolkids
and their damn dreams.

02:12.766 --> 02:15.703
Are you nuts?!

02:15.736 --> 02:18.372
You're out of your head!

02:18.406 --> 02:20.841
(enraged screaming)

02:20.874 --> 02:21.809
- What are you staring at?!
- Ay.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.911
Guess I won't be leaving
you alone out there.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.313
(buzzer sounds)

02:25.346 --> 02:27.415
Come on in, guys.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.350
All right, gentlemen...
the journey

02:29.383 --> 02:32.520
of a thousand miles
starts with one breath.

02:32.553 --> 02:35.756
If you meet the
Buddha in the lane,

02:35.789 --> 02:37.425
feed him the ball.

02:37.458 --> 02:38.592
Never forget,

02:38.626 --> 02:40.528
you can't step
in the same river twice.

02:43.664 --> 02:44.498
- Pete.
- Coach,

02:44.532 --> 02:46.500
what the hell are
you talking about?

02:46.534 --> 02:47.768
LARRY: I think what Coach Eppes

02:47.801 --> 02:50.771
is trying to say is we all learn
to write in the second grade,

02:50.804 --> 02:52.940
but most of us go on
to do greater things,

02:52.973 --> 02:55.709
so get the hell out
there and decide

02:55.743 --> 02:59.313
if you want to matriculate
or be left behind.

02:59.913 --> 03:00.781
(team shouting)

03:00.814 --> 03:01.815
Get out of here!

03:01.849 --> 03:03.851
Come on!

03:03.884 --> 03:05.653
Phil Jackson?

03:05.686 --> 03:07.388
Bobby Knight.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.223
What are you talking about? That
was cheap.

03:09.257 --> 03:10.724
I just... I'm saying it was
cheap.

03:10.758 --> 03:11.592
I disagree.

03:11.625 --> 03:12.526
12% is fine--
that food was terrible.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.695
Okay, well, you don't
blame the waiter.

03:14.728 --> 03:15.729
You get mad
at the chef.

03:15.763 --> 03:18.232
Yeah, but he's got
all those knives back there

03:18.266 --> 03:19.567
and my gun's in the car.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.968
(phone ringing)
Oh.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.538
Yeah, Eppes.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.507
Did you check
his credentials?

03:26.540 --> 03:27.908
(whispering):
It's the Curtis case.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.477
That happens
every time

03:29.510 --> 03:30.611
a convict's about to get
executed.

03:30.644 --> 03:31.512
Uh-huh.

03:31.545 --> 03:32.580
Evidence surfaces
at the eleventh hour

03:32.613 --> 03:34.915
that's going to exonerate
him, but it never does.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.517
All right,
put him through.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.352
Yeah, this is Don Eppes.

03:38.386 --> 03:41.255
DR. STANLEY: I want you to know
I would not be making this call

03:41.289 --> 03:42.690
if I did not believe
in the validity

03:42.723 --> 03:45.025
of what I'm about to tell you.
(rattling)

03:45.058 --> 03:48.396
I have compelling reason to
believe John Curtis is innocent.

03:48.429 --> 03:49.563
All right, Doctor.

03:49.597 --> 03:50.364
Doctor, my ass.

03:50.398 --> 03:52.566
50 bucks says
Curtis hired him.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.801
(receiver clicks)
Hello?

03:53.834 --> 03:55.436
Hello, Dr. Stanley?

03:57.305 --> 03:58.339
He's gone.

03:58.372 --> 03:59.440
Yeah, he probably
got cold feet

03:59.473 --> 04:00.474
when he heard
your voice.

04:01.775 --> 04:04.445
John Curtis killed Roger Webster
four years ago.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.580
I helped to write his obit,
and I'm looking forward

04:06.614 --> 04:07.848
to reading Curtis's in the
morning.

04:07.881 --> 04:08.782
Yeah, but

04:08.816 --> 04:10.651
the guy's got a few hours
to live, right?

04:10.684 --> 04:12.486
Well, it's going
to take a lot more

04:12.520 --> 04:14.388
than a prank call to
set that guy free.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.590
(phone line ringing)

04:16.624 --> 04:18.492
Hey, David,
I need you to follow up

04:18.526 --> 04:20.394
on a call
that just came through.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.465
DAVID: So, uh, Attila the Hun or
Genghis Khan?

04:24.498 --> 04:25.466
NIKKI:
I don't understand.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.535
DAVID: It's a game that me and
Granger play.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.737
If you can go back in time,
kill any bad guy you want,

04:29.770 --> 04:31.872
- who would you take out?
- (sighs) Both.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.507
No, but you only
have one bullet.

04:33.541 --> 04:35.075
Yeah, but I got a time
machine, right?

04:35.108 --> 04:36.710
So I can just
go back and forth,

04:36.744 --> 04:38.546
you know, reload-- bop,
bop-- ghost 'em both.

04:38.579 --> 04:39.547
(sighs)

04:39.580 --> 04:40.981
I cannot wait for Granger

04:41.014 --> 04:42.816
to get back
from his fishing trip.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.585
(scoffs)

04:44.618 --> 04:45.786
It's a stupid game.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.438
(glass shards crunching)

05:16.850 --> 05:18.752
This blood's
still flowing.

05:18.786 --> 05:20.554
This just happened.

05:20.588 --> 05:21.722
Calling it in.
(cell phone beeping)

05:21.755 --> 05:24.625
Uh, rescue unit
to 10060 Beverly Drive.

05:24.658 --> 05:25.659
(clattering)

05:25.693 --> 05:26.660
Multiple
gunshot wounds.

05:26.694 --> 05:27.495
Victim is critical.

05:27.528 --> 05:28.696
Damn it.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.577
(tires screeching)

05:43.611 --> 05:45.613
Whoa.
(automatic gunfire)

05:47.581 --> 05:49.750
(gun firing)

05:49.783 --> 05:51.685
(automatic gunfire resumes)

05:51.719 --> 05:53.387
(tires screeching)

06:04.798 --> 06:07.901
(garbled radio transmission)

06:07.935 --> 06:08.936
ROBIN:
I'll catch up.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.604
- You okay?
- DAVID: Yeah.

06:10.638 --> 06:11.872
Opened up on me from over there.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.541
Engine block saved my life.

06:13.574 --> 06:14.542
- And the shrink?
- He was pronounced

06:14.575 --> 06:16.577
dead on the ride
to the hospital.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.579
Anything with
the security cameras?

06:18.612 --> 06:19.480
Back of a guy's head.

06:19.513 --> 06:20.914
DOT has nothing else
looking this way.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.716
Okay, a psychiatrist calls
to reveal a secret

06:22.750 --> 06:24.051
that might set
a killer free,

06:24.084 --> 06:25.619
but before he can,
he's shot to death.

06:25.653 --> 06:26.754
Yeah, I think I saw that movie.

06:26.787 --> 06:27.955
Yeah, how did it end?

06:27.988 --> 06:29.189
This guy gets off
of death row, right,

06:29.222 --> 06:31.091
and he goes on this
killing spree.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.962
Right, I'll go look
for tire tracks.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.764
(sighs)

06:36.797 --> 06:38.432
DON: Liz, what have we got?

06:38.466 --> 06:40.468
Uh, killer definitely
wasn't a junkie.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.202
I can tell you that much--
left the meds

06:42.235 --> 06:43.604
and the script pads.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.506
Must have cleaned
the desk off

06:45.539 --> 06:47.207
'cause there's no
appointment book,

06:47.240 --> 06:48.642
no laptop,

06:48.676 --> 06:50.143
and techs say oil residue
and smudge marks

06:50.177 --> 06:51.945
indicate files and papers
were taken.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.481
- You call the hospital?
- They sent over

06:53.514 --> 06:54.648
a partial list of patients.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.484
Doc also worked pro bono
for the city

06:56.517 --> 06:58.752
and saw a lot of ex-cons,
so I'm waiting on that list.

06:58.786 --> 07:01.188
Tell Nikki to call
if the DA drags his feet here,

07:01.221 --> 07:02.856
'cause we don't got
a lot of time.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.458
What have you got here?

07:04.492 --> 07:05.693
Forensics is trying to
pull hidden information

07:05.726 --> 07:07.528
off these blank sheets
of paper we found

07:07.561 --> 07:09.563
- on the doctor's desk.
- What, this is the thing

07:09.597 --> 07:11.131
the lab rats
have been bragging about?

07:11.164 --> 07:12.633
A molecule
attaches itself

07:12.666 --> 07:14.535
to the ink of the
underlying paper,

07:14.568 --> 07:16.770
and then I guess a bunch
of other molecules

07:16.804 --> 07:17.838
come join the party.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.573
What does it tell us?

07:19.607 --> 07:22.175
Okay, the papers that
were stolen were lying

07:22.209 --> 07:23.844
on top of this pad
and left

07:23.877 --> 07:26.246
traces of ink
that we can't see

07:26.279 --> 07:27.715
embedded in the fibers.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.049
Sounds more like
Charlie's world to me.

07:29.082 --> 07:30.551
Exactly.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.085
ROBIN:
John Curtis.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.721
Top of the LA food chain.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.556
Ran his own crime family.

07:35.589 --> 07:36.657
Never got
his hands dirty...

07:36.690 --> 07:38.091
till he decided
to put a bullet

07:38.125 --> 07:39.660
through Roger Webster's head.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.662
Seen around town:
best restaurants, fancy cars.

07:41.695 --> 07:44.264
Claimed to be a contractor
making 150 grand a year.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.033
Boss didn't like
being shown up.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.735
Made it a point
to go after him.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.603
And then, he went
after one of yours.

07:49.637 --> 07:50.704
Curtis killed Webster.

07:50.738 --> 07:53.641
We had wiretaps on him 24-7,
froze his bank accounts.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.576
Finally, he cracked,
made a full confession.

07:55.609 --> 07:56.744
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:56.777 --> 07:59.613
LAPD had a stiff hand in it,
but they got the job done.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.782
It says he never
asked for an appeal?

08:01.815 --> 08:04.585
Bunch of human rights groups
did it for him.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.019
Curtis bragged
about killing Webster.

08:06.053 --> 08:08.121
There's no way
this guy is innocent.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.623
The shrink died
for a reason.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.992
What, all of a sudden, you
don't want to work late?

08:12.025 --> 08:13.861
Well, only when it's a waste
of my time.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.529
LIZ:
Sorry to pull you

08:15.563 --> 08:16.864
- off the court.
- CHARLIE: Oh, it's okay.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.198
Tip-off's not
for a few more minutes.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.633
Techs could only get so far.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.202
Well, I can put the number 13
on my T-shirt.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.937
Doesn't make me Steve Nash.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.706
- Basketball analogy.
- I get it.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.708
I can clean this up--
it's just a question

08:27.741 --> 08:28.809
of Gaussian filtering and OCR.

08:28.842 --> 08:29.843
All right, Coach.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.011
Let's hear the play.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.180
Okay, imagine a rainbow
which is formed

08:33.213 --> 08:34.848
when a beam of white light

08:34.882 --> 08:37.150
passes through drops
of rainwater in the air

08:37.184 --> 08:38.686
and is refracted or bent.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.788
Each color is separated
into its components,

08:40.821 --> 08:42.155
but when the moisture
evaporates,

08:42.189 --> 08:43.557
so does the rainbow.

08:43.591 --> 08:45.559
My algorithm acts
like the raindrops

08:45.593 --> 08:47.160
by separating the ink
on this paper

08:47.194 --> 08:49.663
into its various components--
or shades of gray.

08:49.697 --> 08:51.999
Now, I can get going on this
right after the game.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.902
John Curtis is going
to be executed at midnight.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.737
This might help prove
his innocence.

08:56.770 --> 08:57.905
Or I, uh...

08:57.938 --> 08:59.006
I can do it now.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.574
ALAN:
Hey, sorry I'm late.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.610
I just got the scouting report
on our opponent's team.

09:02.643 --> 09:03.811
Now, the good news is,

09:03.844 --> 09:04.978
they're the worst team
in their conference.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.047
And... and the bad
news is that, uh,

09:07.080 --> 09:09.149
compared to us,
they're, uh, great.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.784
Uh...

09:10.818 --> 09:11.752
what are you doing now?

09:11.785 --> 09:13.587
Gaussian filtering.

09:13.621 --> 09:14.588
What play is that?

09:14.622 --> 09:15.823
It's kind of like a rainbow.

09:15.856 --> 09:16.724
- Rainbow?
- Mm-hmm.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.726
Oh... oh, you mean
the rainbow jumper?

09:18.759 --> 09:20.728
Larry Bird
used to shoot that way.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.963
Hey, listen, don't leave
Larry alone out there.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.564
All right.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.170
I don't think I've ever
seen you like this.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.839
Oh, please, you've
killed more people

09:31.872 --> 09:33.273
in the line of duty
than Wyatt Earp.

09:33.306 --> 09:34.675
Yeah, well, that's
a little different.

09:34.708 --> 09:35.609
How you doing?

09:35.643 --> 09:37.645
Oh, what, so it's okay
for you to decide,

09:37.678 --> 09:39.913
but not for 12 of your peers?
What are you talking about?

09:39.947 --> 09:40.981
Robin, I had no choice.

09:41.014 --> 09:43.651
"Choice" is the operative
word here-- I had to.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.719
So, Don Eppes knows better
than everyone else?

09:45.753 --> 09:47.755
No, look, one
is to save a life.

09:47.788 --> 09:48.989
The other is, uh...

09:49.022 --> 09:51.024
it's state-sponsored
revenge.

09:51.058 --> 09:53.627
Good Book says, "An
eye for an eye."

09:53.661 --> 09:54.862
Ask your rabbi
about that one.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.764
Well, it's funny--
I actually did.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.131
You know, there's
a misconception about that.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.333
It was about money;
it wasn't about punishment.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.736
I mean, I can have a car
take you home, if you want.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.004
(alarm blaring)
Man, I'm not carrying anything.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.973
Hey, don't
touch me, man.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.708
- We got a problem here?
- Do we...

10:07.741 --> 10:09.209
- Hey.
- Get your hands off me, man!

10:09.242 --> 10:10.310
(grunting)

10:10.343 --> 10:11.178
I'm cool.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.312
You don't seem very cool.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.281
Check this
out for me.

10:14.314 --> 10:15.315
You got anything
on you?

10:15.348 --> 10:16.349
- No.
- Really?

10:16.383 --> 10:18.986
Julien Curtis.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.822
John's son-- he doesn't
have a record.

10:21.855 --> 10:22.690
Yet.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.324
I'm here to say good-bye
to my dad, okay?

10:24.357 --> 10:25.392
I'm not carrying.

10:25.425 --> 10:26.326
All right, relax.

10:26.359 --> 10:29.697
I got three inches
of a knife blade in me.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.732
When I was 12,
a drug dealer came looking

10:31.765 --> 10:33.366
for my old man,
and I didn't give him up.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.868
DON:
All right, fine.

10:34.902 --> 10:36.269
Just take it easy.

10:40.007 --> 10:42.676
(whistle blows)

10:42.710 --> 10:43.844
(cheering)

10:43.877 --> 10:45.245
Hands up! Hands up!

10:45.278 --> 10:47.047
LARRY: Stop him now! Stop him!

10:47.080 --> 10:48.015
There you go!

10:48.048 --> 10:50.017
LARRY:
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

10:50.050 --> 10:51.418
Match up defense.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.787
CHARLIE: The computer's
processing my algorithm,

10:53.821 --> 10:55.322
but I've noticed
our model for the defense

10:55.355 --> 10:57.257
based on the Speedsters'
strength just isn't working,

10:57.290 --> 10:59.092
so I'm thinking
we have corrupt data, Lawrence.

10:59.126 --> 11:00.994
I don't think it's
the data, Charles.

11:01.028 --> 11:01.895
All right, we got it...

11:01.929 --> 11:03.130
We just need
to give it some more time.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.331
The match up defense works.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.166
Uh, apparently not too well.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.702
While I agree we are presently
getting our asteroids kicked,

11:08.736 --> 11:11.972
I think if you were here,
you'd see that-that panic

11:12.005 --> 11:13.473
is not the right course
of action!

11:13.506 --> 11:15.242
Oh, come on!

11:15.275 --> 11:16.309
Come on! Come on!

11:16.343 --> 11:17.845
Come on! Come on! Come on!

11:17.878 --> 11:19.246
Get back down here!
Get back down here!

11:19.279 --> 11:20.814
Larry, I-I need to call Liz.

11:20.848 --> 11:21.782
I'll be there in five.

11:21.815 --> 11:22.783
(Larry groans)

11:22.816 --> 11:23.984
(beep)

11:24.017 --> 11:26.019
NIKKI: There were no witnesses
to Roger Webster's murder.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.421
Forensics found skin
under his nails that

11:28.455 --> 11:29.790
didn't match Curtis's.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.024
Samples of blood
were A-positive.

11:31.058 --> 11:31.959
Curtis was O.

11:31.992 --> 11:33.326
According to this,
eyewitnesses disagreed

11:33.360 --> 11:35.095
on the color of the car

11:35.128 --> 11:36.296
seen near the reservoir

11:36.329 --> 11:38.866
where Webster's
body was found.

11:38.899 --> 11:41.869
One saw a black Rover,
one saw a navy Rover.

11:41.902 --> 11:42.970
And which color was Curtis's?

11:43.003 --> 11:44.371
He drove a green Escalade.

11:46.506 --> 11:49.009
So how did they convict
this guy?

11:49.042 --> 11:49.877
His confession.

11:49.910 --> 11:52.045
Webster was coming
out of work late.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.181
I waited in the garage.

11:54.214 --> 11:58.018
Oh, by the way,
your security over there sucks.

11:58.051 --> 12:02.422
Anyway, I took him at gunpoint
up to the Hollywood Reservoir.

12:02.455 --> 12:03.791
But you know that.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.225
That's where you found the body.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.094
When we got up there,

12:07.127 --> 12:09.029
I shot him in the back
of the head.

12:09.062 --> 12:12.165
He fell out of the car
onto the ground.

12:12.199 --> 12:15.235
He was still breathing, so I...

12:15.268 --> 12:18.038
I kicked him in the head
to keep him quiet.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.907
After that,
he was pretty much dead.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.111
NIKKI: Okay, I would have voted
guilty, too.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.246
It could be a 51-50?

12:26.279 --> 12:27.781
No, the shrink okayed him.

12:27.815 --> 12:28.982
He's right as rain.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.117
Yeah, still,

12:30.150 --> 12:31.451
with no real hard evidence

12:31.484 --> 12:33.053
linking Curtis
to the crime scene,

12:33.086 --> 12:35.455
if he didn't confess,
he would have walked.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.157
Yeah.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.994
LARRY:
Get the ball and shut up... now!

12:41.028 --> 12:42.562
Man open! Man open!

12:42.595 --> 12:44.064
(yells)
All right, easy.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.565
ALAN: Easy easy.
Defense, defense.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.068
Remember de...?
Pick him up! Pick him up! Ooh.

12:48.101 --> 12:51.972
Hey, Ref, call it
both ways, Zebra!

12:52.005 --> 12:53.506
What are you having,
an ocular eclipse?

12:53.540 --> 12:54.441
CHARLIE: Take it
easy, Larry.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.076
- Come on!
- Fill the lane! Fill the lane!

12:56.109 --> 12:57.077
You know what? Time out, Ref.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.012
(blows whistle)
Time out!

12:59.046 --> 13:00.180
Cal Sci.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.348
Come on, get in here, guys.

13:01.381 --> 13:02.883
All right,
now listen to me.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.117
We're still in this thing.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.819
We just need
to stick to the math.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.120
Now, Pete, the angle
of your jump shot

13:07.154 --> 13:08.121
is off the optimal
trajectory,

13:08.155 --> 13:10.390
so I need you to work on that,
and J.J., man,

13:10.423 --> 13:12.525
you're running the isosceles
set way too high.

13:12.559 --> 13:15.062
So, focus for me, all right?
Now, get out there!

13:15.095 --> 13:15.896
(whistle blows)

13:15.929 --> 13:18.165
Let's go! (sighs)

13:18.198 --> 13:20.300
Blue Eagle Motion
with relativity.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.534
Uh, no, no.
3-2 pi motion.

13:21.568 --> 13:22.970
No. They will
expect that.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.105
How can they expect it?
We just made it up.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.206
ALAN: Would you call something
already?

13:26.239 --> 13:28.308
Blue Eagle, uh,
uh, whatever.

13:29.576 --> 13:30.844
Bad time?

13:30.878 --> 13:32.012
Yeah. Uh, no. Here.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.313
This is as much
as I could do.

13:33.346 --> 13:34.882
All the information's there.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.183
You just need to sort
through it, all right?

13:36.216 --> 13:38.051
Now, show
some hustle.

13:38.085 --> 13:39.486
Grab the rebound! Ooh!

13:41.421 --> 13:42.990
MAN:
Nice legs, Counselor.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.225
Want to come
check out my briefs?

13:45.258 --> 13:45.926
(chuckles)

13:45.959 --> 13:47.160
Don't. It only encourages them.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.464
You're not used
to this, are you?

13:51.498 --> 13:52.966
I can handle it.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.902
(buzzer sounds)

14:03.010 --> 14:04.978
Agent Eppes.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.980
Miss Brooks.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.916
Welcome.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.298
DON: So, a man called me
tonight.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.000
Told me he could prove
you were innocent.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.168
And you believe him?

14:28.201 --> 14:30.003
Well, he died
before I could find out.

14:31.138 --> 14:33.340
But your gut tells you
otherwise.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.975
Your confession
told me otherwise.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.309
(sighs)

14:36.343 --> 14:38.478
U.S. Attorney's office.

14:38.511 --> 14:39.446
I get it.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.214
You and Webster.

14:41.248 --> 14:42.682
Long lunches at the Biltmore.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.052
The more you talk,
the closer to death you get.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.356
You know what four years
of solitary teaches a man?

14:49.389 --> 14:50.323
What's that?

14:50.357 --> 14:51.491
There are things

14:51.524 --> 14:53.026
far worse than death.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.363
So, this guy's name
was Dr. Henry Stanley.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.066
Means nothing to me.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.401
Would you like me
to tell you again?

15:01.434 --> 15:04.204
Maybe I can clear
your conscience?

15:04.237 --> 15:05.505
I did it.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.474
I killed Webster.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.542
Quicker 12:01
comes, the better.

15:09.576 --> 15:10.610
I agree.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.950
I regret nothing.

15:16.984 --> 15:19.419
I went home, took a bath

15:19.452 --> 15:21.621
and had a nice meal.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.356
There's something about
this confession...

15:23.390 --> 15:25.125
The results
of the tire tracks

15:25.158 --> 15:27.227
from outside Stanley's
office came back.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.262
Get a load of this.
That matches

15:29.296 --> 15:30.964
a Dodge Charger, '09,
just like you drive.

15:30.998 --> 15:32.199
I have an alibi.

15:32.232 --> 15:33.366
I was with you.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.303
You see,

15:36.336 --> 15:38.471
here-here's where Granger
would say something like,

15:38.505 --> 15:41.308
"Well, don't count on me
testifying for you in court."

15:41.341 --> 15:42.509
You talk about him a lot.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.511
Don't you have a girl you should
be talking about instead?

15:46.113 --> 15:47.414
Hey, thing is, this car--

15:47.447 --> 15:49.016
weight distribution,

15:49.049 --> 15:51.384
axle differential--
it really is a police model.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.453
You're saying a cop shot at me?

15:53.486 --> 15:55.522
No. I'm saying a cop was there
and left in a hurry.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.158
Hey, you guys.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.492
How was the game?

15:59.526 --> 16:01.228
As good as they are at math,

16:01.261 --> 16:03.196
that's how bad Larry
and Charlie are at hoops.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.497
(computer trills)

16:04.531 --> 16:06.399
LIZ: So, Charlie was able to
decipher it,

16:06.433 --> 16:08.535
but what a mess, huh?

16:08.568 --> 16:10.137
Some of these look like notes.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.338
Could be patient names.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.406
It's gonna take a while to
untangle them and run them all.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.376
"A while" is a luxury
Curtis does not have.

16:19.112 --> 16:20.547
LARRY:
Get the ball!

16:20.580 --> 16:22.015
All right, pack
line defense.

16:24.384 --> 16:25.052
- Oh!
- Hey!

16:25.085 --> 16:25.918
(whistle blows)

16:25.952 --> 16:28.221
Ref, that was flagrant.
(blows whistle)

16:28.255 --> 16:30.223
Get off the court, or I'm
giving you a technical.

16:30.257 --> 16:33.493
You are as dense
as a black hole.

16:33.526 --> 16:34.327
What did you call me?

16:34.361 --> 16:37.730
Your gravitational field
is so dense,

16:37.764 --> 16:40.767
electromagnetic radiation
could not possibly escape.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.569
(blows whistle)
(groans)

16:42.602 --> 16:44.137
Technical.
Cal Sci coach.

16:44.171 --> 16:45.505
- What did I say?
- Calm down.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.607
All I did was call
him a black hole.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.142
You called him a black hole?

16:51.178 --> 16:53.613
I thought
doctors played golf all day.

16:53.646 --> 16:56.216
This shrink must have seen
about 50 clients a week.

16:56.249 --> 16:58.085
All right, next.

16:58.118 --> 16:59.652
Uh, Steve Olin.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.621
(typing)

17:01.654 --> 17:02.622
(computer trills)

17:02.655 --> 17:03.790
Ooh.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.492
Not unless being ugly's
a crime.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.493
(laughs)

17:06.526 --> 17:07.460
Next.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.062
Uh, John Rho.

17:09.096 --> 17:09.929
(typing)

17:09.962 --> 17:12.332
How come everyone in LA
sees a shrink?

17:12.365 --> 17:14.067
Ever try finding a parking spot
at lunchtime?

17:14.101 --> 17:16.669
Good point.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.471
Okay, Charles Rollins.

17:18.505 --> 17:20.507
(typing)

17:20.540 --> 17:23.310
LIZ:
Hmm.

17:23.343 --> 17:24.344
Things just got
more interesting.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.578
Our doctor had
an appointment

17:25.612 --> 17:26.446
with Rollins the day he died.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.481
NIKKI:
Yeah. Assault, assault, assault.

17:28.515 --> 17:29.782
Manslaughter.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.084
Finally. How?

17:31.118 --> 17:32.152
Shot a man to death.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.820
Says he was released last week.

17:33.853 --> 17:36.589
Hey, what's that next
to Rollins' name up there?

17:38.558 --> 17:39.659
Uh, Danny Hill.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.328
(typing)

17:41.361 --> 17:42.595
Hey that's not on
the client list.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.533
(sighs)

17:46.566 --> 17:47.800
Hey, check this out.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.569
Arresting detective

17:49.602 --> 17:51.504
in the Curtis case
was Danielle Hill.

17:51.538 --> 17:54.541
(typing)

17:54.574 --> 17:56.209
Maybe she was the one outside

17:56.243 --> 17:57.510
the shrink's office.

17:57.544 --> 18:00.347
Stanley wanted to talk
to her about something.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.314
Let's find out what.

18:07.354 --> 18:08.621
That's Tony Wolf,

18:08.655 --> 18:09.789
Curtis's attorney.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.191
Hey, Tony.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.693
How you doing?
(mutters)

18:13.726 --> 18:15.395
- Ooh.
- Look, if Curtis is working

18:15.428 --> 18:17.297
some angle here,
I want to know about it.

18:17.330 --> 18:19.366
Look, I didn't ask
to come here, all right?

18:19.399 --> 18:20.667
And yet, here you are.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.202
Anti-capital punishment
groups...

18:22.235 --> 18:24.304
looking for that
last-minute reprieve.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.772
Put me on
retainer years ago.

18:25.805 --> 18:28.275
I should have said no
years ago, but, you know.

18:28.308 --> 18:29.075
DON:
And give up

18:29.108 --> 18:30.610
all those appeals,
all that money?

18:30.643 --> 18:32.345
(chuckles) Not enough for having
to deal with Curtis.

18:32.379 --> 18:33.680
I interviewed

18:33.713 --> 18:35.515
his family once
without his permission.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.884
I found a bullet in my mailbox
the next day.

18:37.917 --> 18:38.918
ROBIN:
Okay, look, I'm not

18:38.951 --> 18:41.454
asking you to break
any client-attorney oath,

18:41.488 --> 18:42.889
but did Curtis ever give you
any reason

18:42.922 --> 18:44.524
to believe that he was innocent?

18:44.557 --> 18:45.692
Screw the oath.

18:45.725 --> 18:48.928
Curtis is a killer, all right?

18:48.961 --> 18:50.930
He told me
about stuff he did.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.499
One time he put

18:52.532 --> 18:54.434
an ice pick through a guy's...

18:54.467 --> 18:57.637
Yeah. Everybody's better
with him gone.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.706
He did kill Roger?

18:59.739 --> 19:00.807
Well, you were there.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.209
He confessed, right?

19:02.242 --> 19:03.376
Textbook.

19:06.246 --> 19:08.848
(crowd chatter)

19:08.881 --> 19:11.751
(hip-hop plays)

19:11.784 --> 19:15.455
* I told 'em...
we was gettin' out *

19:15.488 --> 19:17.624
* Yeah, we be
riding and rolling *

19:17.657 --> 19:19.692
* Oh, baby, just got paid

19:19.726 --> 19:22.195
* Stand by
for the rolling roll *

19:22.229 --> 19:24.397
* Rolling in the USA

19:24.431 --> 19:26.866
* Ooh, yeah,
who cares where I'm going? *

19:26.899 --> 19:29.336
*

19:29.369 --> 19:31.671
* Stand by
for the rolling roll *

19:31.704 --> 19:33.406
* Rolling in the USA

19:33.440 --> 19:36.676
* Woke up, stretched
this morning like yeah, man *

19:36.709 --> 19:38.911
* Two-seater looking sleeker
than an airplane *

19:38.945 --> 19:41.581
* If you roll you roll,
and I don't care, man *

19:41.614 --> 19:43.616
*

19:43.650 --> 19:46.753
* Ooh, yeah,
who cares where I'm going? *

19:46.786 --> 19:47.987
*

19:48.020 --> 19:49.422
CHARLIE:
Swing around!

19:52.292 --> 19:53.693
(cheering)
CHARLIE: Call the double team.

19:53.726 --> 19:54.561
Is this the defense?

19:54.594 --> 19:56.263
Watch the elbow.
That's an elbow, Ref.

19:56.296 --> 19:57.897
- Charlie, I want to...
- No, not now.

19:57.930 --> 19:58.998
Hey, hands up!

19:59.031 --> 20:02.269
Terry? Terry,
increase your volume.

20:02.302 --> 20:03.970
Curtis's confession, okay--
it could prove his innocence,

20:04.003 --> 20:06.773
but FBI techs, they can't
make heads or tails of it.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.741
Okay, that's because your techs
are analyzing his confession

20:08.775 --> 20:09.976
for stress points
and inconsistencies.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.978
Hey, how many steps
you going to allow him?

20:12.011 --> 20:13.880
Five? Six?
N plus three?

20:13.913 --> 20:16.516
Okay. All right, and-and
they should be doing what?

20:16.549 --> 20:18.351
The key is to compare
Curtis's statement

20:18.385 --> 20:19.986
against other auditory
examples from his past

20:20.019 --> 20:22.289
to look for irregularities
in the speech pattern.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.656
That's a pentagon,

20:23.690 --> 20:25.692
and I'm asking for an
equilateral triangle.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.727
Imagine I'm a basketball player?

20:27.760 --> 20:29.829
All right. All right.

20:29.862 --> 20:32.732
In order for a shooter
to have an effective jump shot,

20:32.765 --> 20:34.567
you need three elements
to work as one--

20:34.601 --> 20:36.636
his arm needs to be
in an L position,

20:36.669 --> 20:37.637
his knees must bend,

20:37.670 --> 20:39.839
and the shooter's hand
has to follow through.

20:39.872 --> 20:41.741
All these components combine

20:41.774 --> 20:44.477
to put the proper arc
and rotation on the ball,

20:44.511 --> 20:46.779
ensuring it'll go through
the net if done correctly.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.748
But it one part fails,
the shot does, too.

20:48.781 --> 20:50.717
In a similar fashion,
our voice is made up

20:50.750 --> 20:51.618
of three
essential parts--

20:51.651 --> 20:53.420
cognitive, emotional
and physiological.

20:53.453 --> 20:54.721
When we tell the truth,

20:54.754 --> 20:56.689
they work in harmony,
but when we lie...

20:56.723 --> 20:58.024
- They break down.
- Exactly.

20:58.057 --> 21:00.693
I won't be able to determine
with 100% accuracy,

21:00.727 --> 21:02.995
but I should be able to
pinpoint irregularities

21:03.029 --> 21:04.464
in Curtis's speech pattern,

21:04.497 --> 21:05.698
if they exist.

21:05.732 --> 21:06.799
- Thanks.
- Hey!

21:06.833 --> 21:07.800
D up, Wang.

21:07.834 --> 21:10.503
(panting)

21:10.537 --> 21:12.772
(grunting)

21:12.805 --> 21:13.940
Ah...

21:13.973 --> 21:16.676
genuine imitation Gucci shoes
walking.

21:16.709 --> 21:19.479
Must be the marshals.

21:19.512 --> 21:21.448
FBI. But nice outfit.

21:21.481 --> 21:22.515
Hey, I remember
when I wasn't

21:22.549 --> 21:23.783
allowed to dress myself either.

21:23.816 --> 21:24.984
- That's funny.
- LIZ: So, you made a case

21:25.017 --> 21:26.886
against John Curtis
four years ago.

21:26.919 --> 21:28.655
I'm looking forward to tonight.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.791
Is that why you guys are here?

21:33.926 --> 21:35.895
Oh, brother.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.764
Don't tell me,
now that it's

21:37.797 --> 21:40.633
dying time, he's saying I forced
his confession.

21:40.667 --> 21:41.634
Tire tracks.

21:41.668 --> 21:44.504
Dodge Charger,
just like the model you drive.

21:44.537 --> 21:45.838
Yeah, we found
them outside

21:45.872 --> 21:47.974
of Dr. Henry Stanley's office
earlier.

21:48.007 --> 21:50.443
Don't you guys have
the same ride?

21:50.477 --> 21:51.611
LIZ: Our name
wasn't listed

21:51.644 --> 21:52.879
on a dead doctor's legal pad

21:52.912 --> 21:54.547
next to an ex-con named Rollins.

21:55.648 --> 21:56.649
Circled.

21:56.683 --> 21:59.118
Mm... I was after him.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.853
Who?

22:00.887 --> 22:01.888
Big Chucky Rollins.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.890
I just put that fat slob away

22:03.923 --> 22:06.092
and the judge overturned
his conviction two weeks ago.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.060
LIZ:
What'd the doc want with you?

22:08.094 --> 22:09.762
Chucky was probably
complaining about me.

22:09.796 --> 22:12.432
I've been all over his ass
since he got out of prison.

22:12.465 --> 22:13.633
Any idea where we can find him?

22:13.666 --> 22:16.636
McDonald's, Burger
King, a trough.

22:16.669 --> 22:20.740
I swear, that guy can't go
an hour without eating.

22:29.582 --> 22:32.051
LAPD got a tip Big Chucky's
been crashing here.

22:32.084 --> 22:34.954
This guy must be
350 pounds soaking wet.

22:34.987 --> 22:38.558
Hard to believe he could
fall off anyone's radar.

22:47.066 --> 22:48.768
Yeah.

22:48.801 --> 22:49.802
(giggles)
Oh, yeah.

22:49.836 --> 22:50.703
Ooh...

22:52.539 --> 22:54.507
FBI.

22:54.541 --> 22:57.477
Hands where I can see 'em.
I want to see some hands.

22:57.510 --> 22:58.445
(women gasping)

22:58.478 --> 22:59.712
Come and get me.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.584
Listen, big guy, don't make
me shoot you, okay?

23:04.617 --> 23:05.985
You can't shoot me, I'm unarmed.

23:06.018 --> 23:07.487
Good point.

23:07.520 --> 23:08.521
Cover me.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.790
(growls)

23:10.823 --> 23:12.992
(grunting)

23:18.731 --> 23:20.032
(chuckling):
Bring on the pain.

23:26.973 --> 23:28.174
Not so tough now, are you?

23:36.215 --> 23:38.785
I went to see the talking
doc like I'm supposed to--

23:38.818 --> 23:39.686
part of my parole agreement.

23:39.719 --> 23:40.753
And when you left him?

23:40.787 --> 23:42.822
He was most
definitely alive.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.691
You were the last patient
he saw today.

23:44.724 --> 23:46.526
Marge Simpson, let's get
something straight.

23:46.559 --> 23:48.194
I was there to save a life,
not take one.

23:48.227 --> 23:50.029
What are you talking about?

23:50.062 --> 23:51.931
John Curtis didn't kill
no lawyer.

23:51.964 --> 23:53.866
I was with him that night.

23:53.900 --> 23:54.834
That's a little
convenient--

23:54.867 --> 23:56.969
you coming in
at the bottom of the ninth.

23:57.003 --> 23:58.471
Where were you
at his trial?

23:58.505 --> 24:00.673
Boss told me to
get, so I did.

24:00.707 --> 24:02.108
He told you to let him dangle?

24:02.141 --> 24:03.676
Oh, Chucky, you're full of it.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.244
You know what Curtis
is capable of?

24:05.277 --> 24:07.614
You don't question
his orders.

24:07.647 --> 24:10.783
The man was not within a mile
of that lawyer that night.

24:10.817 --> 24:13.052
I can't figure
this out.

24:13.085 --> 24:14.053
I say scam.

24:14.086 --> 24:15.254
Curtis pulls
a murder,

24:15.287 --> 24:16.889
knows he's going
to get caught eventually,

24:16.923 --> 24:18.725
so he confesses,
does four years,

24:18.758 --> 24:20.192
and now he's planning
on skating.

24:20.226 --> 24:21.861
Small price to pay
for killing a man.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.696
That's a pretty
shaky game plan.

24:23.730 --> 24:26.699
Big Chucky can sign a sworn
statement, pass a polygraph,

24:26.733 --> 24:28.868
but as long as Curtis sticks
to his confession,

24:28.901 --> 24:32.104
no judge is going to give
a stay of execution.

24:32.138 --> 24:35.174
So do you think
his confession's legit?

24:35.207 --> 24:38.177
I think we have a murder
to solve-- Stanley's--

24:38.210 --> 24:40.680
and if the key to that is
Curtis's confession,

24:40.713 --> 24:42.515
then we have to keep on digging.

24:42.549 --> 24:44.884
(cheering and applause)

24:46.686 --> 24:48.120
LARRY:
Stop that guy.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.856
(exasperated laugh)

24:51.157 --> 24:53.059
(buzzer sounds)

24:56.028 --> 24:58.598
Oh, hey, hey, guys,
hey, smile, smile.

24:58.631 --> 25:00.132
It's going to be all right.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.268
Hey, Larry, I'm sorry.
It's just this case.

25:02.301 --> 25:04.203
No, listen, a man's life
hangs in the balance,

25:04.236 --> 25:06.238
and this was all just
an experiment of sorts.

25:06.272 --> 25:07.273
Well, thank you
for understanding.

25:07.306 --> 25:09.842
Um, listen, I know things
are rough out there,

25:09.876 --> 25:12.311
but I think in the second half,
we have a real good shot.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.080
- I mean, we just got to...
- Okay, sounds good.

25:14.113 --> 25:15.582
- Where are you going?
- Well,

25:15.615 --> 25:16.949
in the words
of Douglas MacArthur...

25:16.983 --> 25:19.218
- You shall return?
- ...Americans never quit.

25:20.687 --> 25:21.721
That's not
helpful.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.823
(speed-dials cell phone)

25:23.856 --> 25:26.626
Larry's never
abandoned me before.

25:26.659 --> 25:28.260
Well, you did leave him first,
you know.

25:28.294 --> 25:31.931
Um, so, so, what now?

25:31.964 --> 25:33.065
I got to get back to my office.

25:33.099 --> 25:33.933
Wait a minute.

25:33.966 --> 25:34.967
Who's going to coach the team,
Charlie?

25:37.269 --> 25:39.706
Nuh-uh. No.

25:39.739 --> 25:41.841
An innocent man may die tonight
unless you blow this whistle.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.743
(sighs)

25:49.215 --> 25:51.283
(sighs)

25:51.317 --> 25:52.919
(blows whistle)

25:52.952 --> 25:56.823
Okay, uh... who
among you is familiar

25:56.856 --> 25:59.592
with the old
Indiana weave?

25:59.626 --> 26:02.795
All right,
so what am I looking at here?

26:02.829 --> 26:03.796
CHARLIE:
All right, see those wavy lines?

26:03.830 --> 26:06.332
They indicate Curtis's
habitual speech pattern.

26:06.365 --> 26:08.601
Okay, so they're
all over the place.

26:08.635 --> 26:09.902
Meaning that he wasn't
completely honest

26:09.936 --> 26:10.903
in his confession.

26:10.937 --> 26:12.271
What, like it was forced?

26:12.304 --> 26:13.940
Not necessarily.
You see, these emotive factors

26:13.973 --> 26:15.875
are more indicative
of someone under duress.

26:15.908 --> 26:16.909
Like someone was beating him

26:16.943 --> 26:18.110
- with a phone book?
- No, no,

26:18.144 --> 26:20.046
if that were the case, there'd
be more internal pressure.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.181
Fear or anger would show up
on my results.

26:22.214 --> 26:23.182
All right.

26:23.215 --> 26:25.017
Thanks, Charlie.

26:26.152 --> 26:29.188
So?

26:29.221 --> 26:31.157
Well, I mean, you're
not going to like this,

26:31.190 --> 26:34.393
but he says the
confession is bull.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.295
Your brother doesn't use
the word "bull."

26:36.328 --> 26:37.830
You're right, he
was rambling on

26:37.864 --> 26:39.031
about emotive factors
or something,

26:39.065 --> 26:40.800
but that was the gist of it.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.001
He can prove this?

26:42.034 --> 26:43.402
Mathematically.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.037
I mean, is that
good enough for you?

26:45.071 --> 26:46.673
Forget me. How about
the Supreme Court, Don?

26:46.706 --> 26:47.874
Robin, look,

26:47.907 --> 26:50.810
it says right here the guy
was convicted on partial DNA.

26:50.843 --> 26:53.813
I was there, and with his
confession, it became 100%.

26:53.846 --> 26:54.847
If the confession is a lie...

26:54.881 --> 26:55.782
You're going
to need

26:55.815 --> 26:57.950
a lot more than the genius
of Charlie Eppes

26:57.984 --> 26:59.018
to set this guy free.

26:59.051 --> 26:59.952
You're going
to need hard evidence.

26:59.986 --> 27:01.921
You're that convinced
that he's guilty?

27:01.954 --> 27:05.391
You're that convinced
that he's innocent?

27:05.424 --> 27:08.194
How many times do I have
to tell you I killed the man?

27:08.227 --> 27:09.128
DON: What, you
couldn't

27:09.161 --> 27:11.063
put up with the nightmares
all of a sudden?

27:11.097 --> 27:13.165
I couldn't deal
with Webster's son

27:13.199 --> 27:16.168
on TV, begging for someone
to find his father.

27:16.202 --> 27:17.403
DON: And that's enough
for you to give up

27:17.436 --> 27:20.039
the whole life--
the babes, the cars, all that?

27:24.076 --> 27:26.045
You ever see
a James Cagney movie

27:26.078 --> 27:27.880
where he plays
an old gangster?

27:27.914 --> 27:29.015
You know why?

27:29.048 --> 27:31.050
There's no such thing.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.318
If I would've kept
going at the rate

27:32.351 --> 27:33.920
I was going,
I would have

27:33.953 --> 27:35.387
ended up in the street dead
somewhere.

27:35.421 --> 27:36.355
I've heard enough.

27:36.388 --> 27:38.190
Hey, Brooks, Brooks.

27:38.224 --> 27:39.959
Come here.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.361
I want to tell you something
about your friend Webster.

27:42.394 --> 27:45.264
You know, he died screaming
and begging for his life,

27:45.297 --> 27:48.367
and that's an image
I cannot silence in my head.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.870
- Robin, come on.
- No matter how hard I try.

27:50.903 --> 27:52.338
You know, the drugs
don't always work.

27:52.371 --> 27:53.940
- Robin.
- They say it feels like

27:53.973 --> 27:55.241
- you're suffocating.
- Let's go.

27:55.274 --> 27:58.044
I hope you suffer,
you son of a bitch.

27:58.077 --> 27:59.111
Come on.

27:59.145 --> 28:00.913
ROBIN:
I can't believe

28:00.947 --> 28:02.348
that you're fighting
to keep this guy alive.

28:02.381 --> 28:03.349
You want
to know why?

28:03.382 --> 28:04.350
I'll tell you.

28:04.383 --> 28:05.217
The first time I killed a man,

28:05.251 --> 28:07.186
I became
a very different person, okay?

28:10.056 --> 28:11.490
I was working fugitives.

28:11.523 --> 28:12.925
This lifer goes over the wall,

28:12.959 --> 28:14.360
kills a mother of three,

28:14.393 --> 28:16.328
steals her car.
We get a drop

28:16.362 --> 28:18.164
on the location
and we kick in the door,

28:18.197 --> 28:20.432
and the guy grabs a gun,
some hooker he's with.

28:20.466 --> 28:21.567
I was fourth
in line.

28:21.600 --> 28:24.003
Everyone else there had
enough experience to hesitate.

28:24.036 --> 28:26.138
I put two rounds
right in the guy's head.

28:26.172 --> 28:28.007
This where the value
of life comes in?

28:28.040 --> 28:30.977
That was the moment I knew
this was what I was meant to do,

28:31.010 --> 28:33.445
but I also knew
that if I were ever wrong,

28:33.479 --> 28:34.881
I'd probably blow
my own brains out.

28:37.016 --> 28:39.218
You really don't feel right
about Curtis?

28:39.251 --> 28:41.453
I don't have my finger
on the trigger here.

28:43.355 --> 28:45.157
All right, we can do it now,
we can do it now.

28:45.191 --> 28:46.425
Keep the
ball moving.

28:52.398 --> 28:53.199
- That's it!
- Hey, I don't

28:53.232 --> 28:54.934
recognize that
as one of our plays.

28:54.967 --> 28:57.103
Because it's not;
it's called the weave.

28:57.136 --> 28:59.972
Same way CCNY won the NCAA
and the NIT titles

29:00.006 --> 29:01.073
in the same year.

29:01.107 --> 29:03.075
- Didn't they cheat?
- Yeah, but they played hard.

29:03.109 --> 29:05.144
ALAN: I mean, blood and sweat
can't be replaced

29:05.177 --> 29:07.179
by, uh, statistics
and, and...

29:07.213 --> 29:08.480
- Bisects.
- Bisects, exactly.

29:08.514 --> 29:09.982
Bisects.

29:10.016 --> 29:11.784
Don't feel too badly;
we're still going to lose.

29:11.818 --> 29:13.452
- Come on, you guys!
- It's not the losing.

29:13.485 --> 29:14.987
It's the fact that
an innocent man could be put

29:15.021 --> 29:16.222
to death in 90 minutes.

29:16.255 --> 29:17.156
I said
stand your ground!

29:20.192 --> 29:21.093
(whistle blows)

29:23.595 --> 29:24.496
I have to go.

29:26.032 --> 29:28.367
I should have seen that coming.

29:34.540 --> 29:37.143
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

29:38.277 --> 29:40.446
My job.

29:40.479 --> 29:43.015
Guy's killed ten people,
probably more,

29:43.049 --> 29:44.984
we never had enough evidence
to convict him on.

29:45.017 --> 29:46.252
This time we did.

29:46.285 --> 29:49.121
(sighs) Listen, that might be
the way you interpret the rules.

29:49.155 --> 29:50.222
That doesn't work for me.

29:51.357 --> 29:53.525
Oh, brother,
Roger was like you.

29:53.559 --> 29:57.830
By the book, always thinking
everyone had a good side.

29:57.864 --> 30:01.033
The two of you.

30:01.067 --> 30:04.136
We were both married
at the time.

30:04.170 --> 30:06.305
I could never tell
anyone.

30:06.338 --> 30:08.107
I couldn't even go
to his funeral.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.209
His wife was
suspicious enough already.

30:10.242 --> 30:13.079
So this is a little
bit more than personal.

30:14.213 --> 30:16.148
You married?

30:17.483 --> 30:19.852
Yeah, so you don't know.

30:19.886 --> 30:22.454
Curtis is dying tonight,
and there's nothing

30:22.488 --> 30:25.291
you or anyone else
can do about it.

30:31.563 --> 30:32.598
So anyway, buddy,
I'm just calling

30:32.631 --> 30:33.499
to make sure everything is cool.

30:33.532 --> 30:35.501
All right,
give me a call when you can.

30:35.534 --> 30:38.037
Is that Colby?

30:38.070 --> 30:39.972
No.

30:43.409 --> 30:45.377
Wait, did you just
call him "baby"?

30:45.411 --> 30:46.612
I said "buddy,"
all right?

30:46.645 --> 30:48.247
I was just calling to
update him on the case.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.181
Is that okay?

30:49.215 --> 30:51.117
Maybe you should try
JDate or something.

30:51.150 --> 30:53.652
Is there a purpose
for you coming over here?

30:53.685 --> 30:55.521
Charlie got the results.

30:55.554 --> 30:57.589
CHARLIE: These are the photos
of Roger Webster

30:57.623 --> 31:00.092
after he was found at the bottom
of the Hollywood Reservoir.

31:00.126 --> 31:02.594
You'll notice the weights
to prevent his body from moving.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.931
Well, this isn't
exactly new, Charlie.

31:04.964 --> 31:07.199
All right, well, here are images
of the footprints...

31:07.233 --> 31:09.335
DAVID: That the FBI concluded
belonged to the killer.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.270
- Exactly.
- And this helps us...?

31:11.303 --> 31:12.538
It helps us because by looking

31:12.571 --> 31:15.374
at the various imprints and the
resting spot of Webster's body,

31:15.407 --> 31:17.443
I can determine the height
and weight of the killer--

31:17.476 --> 31:19.912
well over six feet, 200 pounds.

31:21.247 --> 31:24.183
Which is nowhere close in size
to Curtis's frame.

31:25.384 --> 31:26.485
DON:
So what's that?

31:26.518 --> 31:27.419
That's the depth of

31:27.453 --> 31:29.221
the left print,
which indicates the killer

31:29.255 --> 31:31.157
highly favored his left side.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.458
DON:
What, like he compensated?

31:32.491 --> 31:33.425
Yeah, my best guess is

31:33.459 --> 31:35.027
some kind of trauma
to his hand or his arm.

31:36.328 --> 31:39.131
I got three inches
of a knife blade in me.

31:39.165 --> 31:40.899
Or shoulder.

31:48.674 --> 31:50.142
LAPD kicked in
Julien's door.

31:50.176 --> 31:51.177
Place was
completely empty.

31:51.210 --> 31:52.078
"Leaving town" empty?

31:52.111 --> 31:54.080
He must have figured
we were on to him.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.282
No offense,
but the governor's still going

31:56.315 --> 31:58.250
to need more than a scar
and Don's gut.

31:58.284 --> 31:59.451
LIZ: Whoa, whoa, whoa, what
about

31:59.485 --> 32:01.387
a phone bill and Don's gut?
Check this out.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.355
Julien's phone records
next to his father's.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.225
NIKKI:
Calls his dad every night.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.060
Talks for a minimum
of five minutes.

32:08.094 --> 32:11.297
Except for on the 22nd.
They talked for 15 seconds.

32:11.330 --> 32:13.165
That's the night
that Webster was killed.

32:13.199 --> 32:15.301
Wait, look
at the time.

32:15.334 --> 32:17.569
Webster's approximate
time of death was 10:50.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.105
This call was ten minutes later.

32:19.138 --> 32:21.007
NIKKI:
Closest cell tower

32:21.040 --> 32:23.009
puts Julien near
Hollywood Reservoir.

32:23.042 --> 32:24.076
Maybe he called
to brag to Daddy.

32:24.110 --> 32:26.445
But Daddy was smart enough
to get him off the line.

32:26.478 --> 32:27.980
And then,
he takes the hit

32:28.014 --> 32:29.215
for the kid,
confesses so his son

32:29.248 --> 32:30.649
doesn't have to go to the chair.

32:30.682 --> 32:32.351
That's some kind
of family love.

32:32.384 --> 32:34.086
Calling the governor's office.

32:40.626 --> 32:43.662
Why don't you let me
die in peace?

32:43.695 --> 32:47.299
Human DNA has 48 markers.

32:47.333 --> 32:50.436
The blood on Webster
matched 24 of yours.

32:53.439 --> 32:55.041
You done?

32:55.074 --> 32:57.509
No, you see, a child
has exactly half

32:57.543 --> 32:59.478
the same DNA as
their parent.

32:59.511 --> 33:00.479
It was your kid who killed him.

33:02.614 --> 33:04.183
You got nothing.

33:04.216 --> 33:05.517
So, Angels With
Dirty Faces?

33:05.551 --> 33:06.785
Cagney goes yelling to the chair

33:06.818 --> 33:08.354
to prove a point
to the kids, right?

33:11.090 --> 33:14.426
You know...
I watched my father

33:14.460 --> 33:16.795
get gunned down
right in front of me.

33:16.828 --> 33:19.065
I couldn't even go
to his funeral and cry.

33:19.098 --> 33:20.466
You know why?

33:20.499 --> 33:23.435
Because I was too busy
fighting off three families

33:23.469 --> 33:25.404
that wanted to destroy mine.

33:25.437 --> 33:28.474
My grandfather shot
a police captain in the head

33:28.507 --> 33:31.610
during his promotion ceremony
in front of 200 officers.

33:33.379 --> 33:35.581
Now, that's what it means
to be a Curtis.

33:35.614 --> 33:36.715
And Julien...

33:38.484 --> 33:40.352
...he's no Curtis.

33:40.386 --> 33:42.154
Oh, so this is your
way of protecting him?

33:42.188 --> 33:43.555
Sixty-four.

33:45.324 --> 33:48.294
I've got 64 bodies on my hands,

33:48.327 --> 33:51.463
and tonight, it all ends.

33:52.598 --> 33:54.166
Now, if you
don't mind,

33:54.200 --> 33:56.468
I'd like to be alone.

34:10.416 --> 34:11.783
Any word from the governor?

34:11.817 --> 34:13.319
His man's reviewing
the evidence,

34:13.352 --> 34:14.586
but ballistics came
back on the gun

34:14.620 --> 34:16.255
that was used to
kill the shrink.

34:16.288 --> 34:19.125
It was used in a triple
murder five years ago.

34:20.859 --> 34:23.329
NIKKI: Oh, that's Che Ray--
I remember him.

34:23.362 --> 34:24.363
Real nasty dude.

34:24.396 --> 34:25.531
Used to shoot at cops.

34:25.564 --> 34:27.766
LIZ:
They recovered the gun.

34:27.799 --> 34:30.236
Put into LAPD evidence,
never destroyed.

34:31.337 --> 34:32.471
(typing)

34:32.504 --> 34:33.539
LIZ:
Arresting officer...

34:33.572 --> 34:35.707
was Danny Hill.

34:35.741 --> 34:38.277
Hill's case, she had access
to the evidence locker.

34:38.310 --> 34:39.445
Right. She follows Rollins,

34:39.478 --> 34:41.413
realizes he might
spring Curtis,

34:41.447 --> 34:43.249
the guy responsible for
her lover's murder.

34:43.282 --> 34:44.816
Love makes you
do crazy things.

34:49.488 --> 34:51.590
You stole the gun from Evidence.

34:51.623 --> 34:52.758
That the best you can do?

34:52.791 --> 34:54.426
No, no, no.

34:54.460 --> 34:55.694
We can do a whole
lot better.

34:55.727 --> 34:57.496
Stanley called
you five times

34:57.529 --> 34:59.598
and left you messages
you never returned.

34:59.631 --> 35:01.433
Told you about
the possibility

35:01.467 --> 35:04.203
that Curtis was innocent,
but you didn't want to hear it,

35:04.236 --> 35:05.537
so Stanley called us.

35:05.571 --> 35:07.139
And then, you called Julien.

35:07.173 --> 35:07.973
NIKKI: How long have you known

35:08.006 --> 35:09.508
that Julien
killed Roger Webster?

35:09.541 --> 35:13.212
(sighs)

35:13.245 --> 35:14.246
Three years ago,

35:14.280 --> 35:18.150
the ACLU brought up
Curtis's case for appeal.

35:18.184 --> 35:19.885
I looked through the files,

35:19.918 --> 35:23.489
I firmed up my testimony...

35:23.522 --> 35:24.790
when I had a suspicion

35:24.823 --> 35:26.425
that Julien
killed Webster

35:26.458 --> 35:28.194
to make his bones
with Daddy.

35:28.227 --> 35:29.528
I confronted Julien.

35:29.561 --> 35:31.897
I looked him right in the eye,

35:31.930 --> 35:34.400
and I got my answer that day.

35:34.433 --> 35:35.634
What about the dead shrink?

35:35.667 --> 35:37.269
All I did
was tell Julien

35:37.303 --> 35:40.506
to stall him
until after the execution.

35:40.539 --> 35:41.873
Killing Stanley,

35:41.907 --> 35:43.375
shooting
at you guys,

35:43.409 --> 35:45.177
was all Julien.

35:45.211 --> 35:48.280
And you're allowing the killer
of the man you love to go free?

35:48.314 --> 35:50.382
The kid is a symptom.

35:50.416 --> 35:54.486
John Curtis is the one
responsible for Roger's death.

35:54.520 --> 35:57.589
And trust me,
Julien is not going free.

35:57.623 --> 36:00.659
He is watching
his father get killed

36:00.692 --> 36:03.595
because he is too much of a
coward to do anything about it.

36:03.629 --> 36:04.930
And guess what?

36:04.963 --> 36:06.565
You guys have to go arrest him,

36:06.598 --> 36:08.234
because you have no choice.

36:10.869 --> 36:12.338
(crowd cheering)

36:12.371 --> 36:13.272
CHARLIE:
All right.

36:13.305 --> 36:14.306
ALAN:
Come on, come on.

36:14.340 --> 36:15.441
D up, D up.
Defense, defense.

36:15.474 --> 36:17.909
- Isosceles, isosceles.
- Keep your hands up-- hands up!

36:17.943 --> 36:20.546
- CHARLIE: Isosce...
- ALAN: Oh, no.

36:20.579 --> 36:22.514
CHARLIE: Four minutes to go, we
shouldn't be trading shots.

36:22.548 --> 36:23.549
We need tighter D.

36:23.582 --> 36:24.883
No, you know
what we need?

36:24.916 --> 36:26.452
- We need a miracle.
- Yeah.

36:30.622 --> 36:31.557
I think I see one.

36:31.590 --> 36:32.658
Huh?

36:33.792 --> 36:35.361
ALAN:
Maybe I've been

36:35.394 --> 36:36.495
drinking too much
Gatorade,

36:36.528 --> 36:37.796
but I think
I see it, too.

36:41.633 --> 36:43.702
(stammering):
But isn't that...

36:43.735 --> 36:45.771
I believe so.
Coach Eppes,

36:45.804 --> 36:47.873
I'd like you to meet
my two new TAs.

36:47.906 --> 36:50.276
That would be
Jordan Farmar

36:50.309 --> 36:51.543
- and Pau Gasol.
- How you doing?

36:51.577 --> 36:52.744
(stammers)

36:52.778 --> 36:54.513
Let me see this
real quick.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.248
CHARLIE: Um...
(clears throat)

36:56.282 --> 36:57.449
Hey, Larry,
you realize

36:57.483 --> 36:58.617
these guys play
for the Lakers?

36:58.650 --> 37:00.252
Yeah, do you think
any of them

37:00.286 --> 37:01.620
- are going to know that?
- Well, yeah.

37:01.653 --> 37:04.490
They're professional
basketball players.

37:06.725 --> 37:07.959
- Oh.
- FARMAR: Hey, yo, Coach,

37:07.993 --> 37:09.027
what's the
pi triangle?

37:09.060 --> 37:10.562
Ah, you like that?

37:10.596 --> 37:12.431
I, uh... I based it
on an algorithm...

37:12.464 --> 37:12.998
Nah, nah.

37:13.031 --> 37:14.065
Actually, looking at it,

37:14.099 --> 37:15.934
it's pretty much the dumbest
thing I've ever seen

37:15.967 --> 37:16.702
in my life.

37:17.869 --> 37:19.805
That's fine.

37:19.838 --> 37:21.607
Uh, what would you
recommend calling?

37:21.640 --> 37:23.675
Have the team run
to one side of the floor.

37:23.709 --> 37:25.711
Let Jordan and me
take care of the rest.

37:26.845 --> 37:28.314
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I like that.

37:28.347 --> 37:29.348
- Sure.
- Th-That's a great plan.

37:29.381 --> 37:30.382
Wh-Why don't
you check in?

37:30.416 --> 37:31.783
You're going to hook us up,
right, Professor?

37:31.817 --> 37:33.018
Absolutely, guys.

37:33.051 --> 37:34.320
All right.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.723
I met them at one
of Coach Jackson's

37:37.756 --> 37:39.691
mandatory
monastery retreats.

37:39.725 --> 37:41.727
Yeah, they must be in touch
with their inner Zen, huh?

37:41.760 --> 37:42.961
What exactly did
you promise them?

37:42.994 --> 37:44.863
- A ride in the space shuttle.
- What?

37:44.896 --> 37:46.064
You can do that?

37:46.097 --> 37:47.466
Are you kidding?

37:47.499 --> 37:48.734
They'll never pass
the height requirement.

37:48.767 --> 37:49.935
Most of us astronauts

37:49.968 --> 37:51.670
are actually very low
to the ground.

37:51.703 --> 37:52.871
(blowing whistle)

37:52.904 --> 37:54.640
All right, Chang,
Nichikawa...

37:54.673 --> 37:55.741
let's hit the bench.

37:55.774 --> 37:59.010
Get out of the game, off the
court. All right, guys.

38:04.015 --> 38:05.016
Here we go.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.422
Oh!

38:10.456 --> 38:11.590
Yeah, that's it.

38:11.623 --> 38:14.626
*

38:25.504 --> 38:32.944
* Cutting belts and magazines
and things you'll never need *

38:32.978 --> 38:35.747
* The mirrors in your room
at night *

38:35.781 --> 38:40.652
* The skies that never fold

38:40.686 --> 38:43.789
* You're sorry
that it matters more *

38:43.822 --> 38:46.792
* But who would ever tell?

38:48.794 --> 38:51.897
* I know you
need to stay above *

38:51.930 --> 38:56.868
* But I swore, I swore,
I swore *

38:56.902 --> 39:01.006
* It's all over your eyes

39:01.039 --> 39:04.943
* There's nothing you can do

39:04.976 --> 39:08.380
* I'm coming out my skin
tonight *

39:08.414 --> 39:13.452
* So tell me
if you're ready or not *

39:13.485 --> 39:16.154
* I'm tired of living
out a lie *

39:16.187 --> 39:20.459
* Sitting here watching
things flying by me *

39:20.492 --> 39:25.063
* And maybe, maybe

39:25.096 --> 39:28.066
* You're gonna save me

39:28.099 --> 39:31.770
* Maybe, maybe

39:31.803 --> 39:35.774
* But I don't know

39:35.807 --> 39:37.509
* I don't think so

39:52.591 --> 39:55.126
* Last night I woke up cold

39:55.160 --> 40:00.499
* And I walked right out
into the dark *

40:00.532 --> 40:08.507
* And 800 reasons why kept
flying into my eyes *

40:08.540 --> 40:11.109
* Wish I could say that I killed
'em dead *

40:11.142 --> 40:15.947
* But they're just much
bigger than I *

40:15.981 --> 40:20.619
* It's all over your eyes

40:20.652 --> 40:24.890
* There's nothing you can do

40:24.923 --> 40:28.994
* I'm coming out my skin
tonight *

40:29.027 --> 40:32.798
* So tell me
if you're ready or not *

40:32.831 --> 40:36.635
* I'm tired of living
out a lie *

40:36.668 --> 40:39.971
* Sitting here watching
things flying by me *

40:40.005 --> 40:45.210
* And maybe, maybe

40:45.243 --> 40:48.079
* You're gonna save me

40:48.113 --> 40:51.817
* Maybe, maybe

40:51.850 --> 40:55.654
* But I don't know

40:55.687 --> 40:58.456
* I don't think so

41:07.198 --> 41:09.801
*

41:11.236 --> 41:14.940
* It's all over your eyes

41:14.973 --> 41:19.711
* There's nothing you can do

41:19.745 --> 41:23.715
* I'm coming out my skin
tonight *

41:23.749 --> 41:27.252
* So tell me
if you're ready or not *

41:27.285 --> 41:31.623
* I'm tired of living
out a lie *

41:31.657 --> 41:34.960
* Sitting here watching
things flying by me *

41:34.993 --> 41:39.898
* And maybe, maybe

41:39.931 --> 41:42.834
* You're gonna save me

41:42.868 --> 41:46.171
* Maybe, maybe

41:46.204 --> 41:50.075
* But I don't know

41:50.108 --> 41:53.845
* I don't think so.
