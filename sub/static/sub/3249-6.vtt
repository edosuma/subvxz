MAN: Signora, your school offers
a chance for betterment, escape.

00:18.480 --> 00:19.759
My daughter...

00:24.240 --> 00:27.199
...Isabella is 1 7 now,

00:27.280 --> 00:30.759
but what prospects are there
for the daughter of a boat-builder?

00:30.840 --> 00:33.479
There's no future for us.
No future but you.

00:35.040 --> 00:37.479
I am moved by your concern
for your daughter.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.399
I believe protecting the future
of one's own

00:41.480 --> 00:44.399
- is a sacred duty.
- Signora...

00:46.480 --> 00:47.959
...she is my world.

00:56.760 --> 00:58.719
Then we will take your world.

FATHER: I knew it!

01:02.680 --> 01:05.359
- I knew it!

Say goodbye to your daughter.

01:11.240 --> 01:14.639
- Now, signora?
- Why wait?

01:14.720 --> 01:16.839
Time ticks.

01:21.440 --> 01:23.959
Be brave, my girl. Make me proud.

Do you like her?

01:47.440 --> 01:49.479
Oh, I do, Mother.

01:49.560 --> 01:51.479
I do.

01:54.880 --> 01:57.119
Hey...!

01:58.280 --> 02:00.719
It's me! Hello!

02:00.800 --> 02:02.759
How are you?

02:02.840 --> 02:04.919
The reason for this call is because

02:05.000 --> 02:08.359
I haven't told you for seven hours
that I love you, which is a scandal,

02:08.480 --> 02:12.359
and even if we weren't getting married
tomorrow, I'd ask you to marry me anyway.

02:12.440 --> 02:14.599
Yes, I would,

02:14.680 --> 02:16.559
because you are smashing!

02:41.080 --> 02:44.479
That's a relief. I thought
I'd burst out of the wrong cake...

02:44.560 --> 02:46.599
again. That reminds me,

02:46.720 --> 02:49.799
there's a girl outside in a bikini. Could
someone let her in and give her a jumper?

02:49.880 --> 02:52.799
Lucy. Lovely girl.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.359
Now, then. Rory.

02:57.440 --> 02:59.759
We need to talk about your fiancée.

03:02.520 --> 03:04.639
She tried to kiss me.

Funny how you can say something
in your head and it soundsfine...

04:02.040 --> 04:06.199
Oh! The life out there, it dazzles.

04:06.280 --> 04:10.279
I mean, it blinds you
to the things that are important.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.799
I've seen it devour relationships
and plans...

04:15.440 --> 04:17.599
It's meant to do that.

04:17.680 --> 04:22.519
...because for one person
to have seen all that,

04:22.600 --> 04:24.639
to taste the glory
and then go back,

04:24.720 --> 04:27.799
it willtear you apart.

04:27.880 --> 04:30.439
So...I'm sending you somewhere.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.959

04:34.200 --> 04:36.719
Anywhere you want, any time you want.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.799
One condition - it has to be amazing.

04:38.880 --> 04:41.479
The Moulin Rouge in 1 890!
The first Olympic Games!

04:41.560 --> 04:43.759
Think of it as a wedding present,
because, frankly,

04:43.840 --> 04:45.719
it's either this or tokens.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.959
It's a lot to take in, isn't it?

04:48.040 --> 04:50.599
Tiny box, huge room inside.
What's that about? Let me explain.

04:50.680 --> 04:54.039
- It's another dimension.
- It's basically another dimen... What?

04:54.120 --> 04:57.879
After Prisoner Zero, I've been reading up
on all the latest scientific theories -

04:57.960 --> 04:59.999
FTL travel, parallel universes.

05:00.080 --> 05:03.679
I like the bit when someone says,
"It's bigger on the inside!"

05:03.760 --> 05:06.519
I always look forward to that.

05:06.600 --> 05:11.199
So, this date. I'm kind of done
with running down corridors.

Impossible city. Preposterous city!

05:36.120 --> 05:39.239
Founded by refugees
running from Attila the Hun.

05:39.360 --> 05:43.199
It was just a collection of little
wooden huts in the middle of the marsh,

05:43.280 --> 05:47.719
but became one of
the most powerful cities in the world.

constantly flooding...

05:52.840 --> 05:56.359

05:56.440 --> 05:58.959
Ah, you've got to love Venice.

05:59.040 --> 06:03.199
And so many people did -
Byron, Napoleon, Casanova.

Ooh, that reminds me.

06:05.200 --> 06:08.439
1 580. That's all right.
Casanova doesn't get born for 1 45 years.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.919
Don't want to run into him.
I owe him a chicken.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.439
You owe Casanova a chicken?

06:13.520 --> 06:16.559
- Long story. We had a bet.

No worries.

- No, we're under quarantine here.

and all because of the grace and wisdom

No, Signora Calvierri has seen it

more than enough.

- Yeah, yeah, I know.

- Amy was just telling me.
- Yeah!

- The Doctor actually went to their house.
- Oh. Right. Well...

14:02.480 --> 14:04.879
OK, so...first we need
to get back in there somehow.

14:04.960 --> 14:07.079
- What?! Back in where?
- AMY: How do we do that?

14:07.160 --> 14:09.159
Come and meet my new friend.

there's no clear way in.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.839
The House of Calvierri is like a fortress.

But there's a tunnel underneath it,

14:19.400 --> 14:21.879
with a ladder and shaft
that leads up into the house.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.199
I tried to get in once myself,

14:24.280 --> 14:26.599
- but I hit a trapdoor.
- You need someone on the inside.

14:26.720 --> 14:29.279
- No.
- You don't know what I was going to say!

14:29.360 --> 14:32.519
That we pretend you're an applicant
for the school to get you inside,

14:32.600 --> 14:34.159
and tonight you come down

14:34.240 --> 14:36.119
- and open the trapdoor to let us in.
- Oh.

- So you do know what I was going to say.
- RORY: Are you insane?

14:38.640 --> 14:41.279
- We don't have another option.
- He said no, Amy.

14:41.360 --> 14:44.319
- Listen to him.
- FATHER: There is another option.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.159

Look, I have a thing about guns
and huge quantities of explosive.

15:02.960 --> 15:06.759
What do you suggest, then? We wait
until they turn her into an animal?

15:10.280 --> 15:12.759
I'll be there three, four hours tops.

15:15.040 --> 15:19.399
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It can't keep happening like this.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.439
This is how they go.

15:23.520 --> 15:27.159
But I have to know. We go together.
Say you're my daughter.

15:27.240 --> 15:30.719
- What?! Don't listen to him!
- Your daughter? You look about nine.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.039
Brother, then.

15:32.120 --> 15:33.719
Too weird. Fiancé.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.959
I'm not having him run around
telling people he's your fiancé!

15:37.040 --> 15:39.159
No. No, you're right.

15:39.240 --> 15:40.879
- Thank you.
- I mean,

15:40.960 --> 15:43.319
they've already seen the Doctor.
You should do it.

15:45.720 --> 15:47.999
- Me?
- Yeah! You can be my brother.

15:48.960 --> 15:52.999
Why is him being your brother weird,
but with me, it's OK?

15:53.080 --> 15:55.079
Actually, I thought you

15:55.160 --> 15:57.119
- were her fiancé.
- Yeah, that's not helping.

15:57.200 --> 16:00.879
This whole thing is mental!
They're vampires, for God's sake!

16:00.960 --> 16:02.399
We hope.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.479
So if they're not vampires...?

16:06.560 --> 16:09.159
Makes you wonder
what could be so bad

16:09.240 --> 16:13.079
it doesn't actually mind
us thinking it's a vampire.

16:13.160 --> 16:17.799
So, basically, both of our parents
are dead from getting the plague.

16:17.880 --> 16:21.159
I'm a gondola...driver...

16:21.240 --> 16:25.039
so...money's a bit tight...

16:26.200 --> 16:28.879
...so having my...sister

16:28.960 --> 16:34.079
go to your school for special people
would be brilliant.

16:35.680 --> 16:37.439
Cheers.

16:39.320 --> 16:41.879
- Have we met?
- I've just got one of those faces.

16:41.960 --> 16:45.559
- I wasn't talking to you.
- She's got the same face...

16:45.640 --> 16:48.919
- which is because she's my sister!
- Carlo, explain yourself.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.679
Why have you brought me this imbecile?

16:50.760 --> 16:53.639
Signora, they have references
from His Majesty the King of Sweden.

16:53.720 --> 16:55.359
What?

16:55.440 --> 16:56.679
Let me see.

17:05.600 --> 17:08.199
Well, now I see
what got my steward so excited.

17:08.280 --> 17:10.879
What say you, Francesco? Do you like her?

17:12.440 --> 17:13.959
Oh, I do, Mother.

17:15.160 --> 17:18.639
- I do.
- Then we'd be delighted to accept her.

17:18.720 --> 17:20.919
Say goodbye to your sister.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.599
Um...um...er...

17:24.680 --> 17:28.679
Tell Uncle...Doctor...
I'll see you both pretty soon, OK?

17:31.760 --> 17:32.919
I'll be fine.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.559

CARLO: There are clothes on the bed.
Get changed and wait here.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.079
Blimey!

18:02.160 --> 18:04.639
This is private education, then?

18:11.120 --> 18:12.239
Hey. Hello.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.279
I'm Amy.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.559
What's your name?

18:17.640 --> 18:19.559
Isabella.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.439
We're going to get you out of here,
but I need you to tell me what's going on.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.479
What is this place?
What are they doing?

18:27.560 --> 18:28.959
They, um...

18:29.040 --> 18:31.159
they come at night.

18:31.240 --> 18:35.639
They gather around my bed
and they take me to a room...

18:35.720 --> 18:39.439
with this green light
and a chair with...

18:39.520 --> 18:44.279
- with straps, as if for a surgeon.
- What happens in there?

18:46.280 --> 18:47.519
I wake up here.

18:49.160 --> 18:53.119
And the sunlight burns my skin
like candle wax.

(BELL TOLLS)

19:42.440 --> 19:44.239
We're here.

19:53.440 --> 19:56.439
Right. OK, I'll go first.
If anything happens to me, go back...

19:56.520 --> 19:58.039
What happened?

19:58.120 --> 19:59.519
Between you and Amy?

20:01.120 --> 20:02.799
- You said she kissed you.
- Now?!

20:02.880 --> 20:04.759
You want to do this now?!

20:06.280 --> 20:07.759
I have a right to know.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.919
I'm getting married in 430 years.

(WIND HOWLS)

20:25.400 --> 20:28.319
- (AMY SHRIEKS, GLASS BREAKS)
- She was frightened. Iwas frightened,

20:28.400 --> 20:31.959
but we survived, and the relief of it...
and so she kissed me.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.199
- And you kissed her back?
- No.

20:35.280 --> 20:36.879
I kissed her mouth.

20:36.960 --> 20:38.359
Funny(!)

20:38.440 --> 20:41.839
Rory...Rory, she kissed me because
I was there. It would have been you.

20:41.920 --> 20:43.399
- It should have been you.
- Yeah.

20:43.440 --> 20:46.039
- It should have been me.
- Exactly. That's why I brought you here.

- Control yourself, child.

20:53.600 --> 20:57.239
- Get your hands off me!
- Psychic paper.

20:57.320 --> 20:59.839
Did you really think
that would work on me?

21:10.560 --> 21:12.279
- Push!
- I'm pushing!

Come on. There we are.

21:23.680 --> 21:25.119
Amy!

21:27.520 --> 21:31.599
- I can't see a thing.
- Just as well I brought this, then.

21:33.400 --> 21:35.559
Ultraviolet. Portable sunlight.

21:35.640 --> 21:38.079
- Yours is bigger than mine.
- Let's not go there.

21:38.160 --> 21:42.359
Where are you from?
Did you fall through the chasm?

21:42.440 --> 21:44.359
Mother, this is pointless.
Let's just start the process.

21:44.440 --> 21:48.519
Hold your tongue, Francesco!
I need to know what this girl is doing

21:48.600 --> 21:52.239
in the world of savages
with psychic paper. Who are you with?

21:52.320 --> 21:54.639
I scarcely believe
your idiot brother sent you.

21:54.720 --> 21:59.119
And what are you doing in myschool?

22:00.600 --> 22:01.879
OK, I'll tell you.

22:01.960 --> 22:06.079
- I'm from Ofsted.

Tease me as if I were your dog?

22:35.840 --> 22:37.759
(WHISPERS) What happened to them?

They've had all the moisture
taken out of them.

22:54.400 --> 22:55.719
Mother...

22:55.800 --> 22:59.199
when you drink from her,
may we share?

22:59.280 --> 23:01.239
I'm so thirsty.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.439
Of course, darling.

23:04.520 --> 23:06.199
That's what vampires do, right?

23:06.280 --> 23:08.879
They drink your blood
and replace it with their own.

23:08.960 --> 23:09.999
Yeah, except these people

23:10.080 --> 23:13.199
haven't just had their blood taken,
but all the water in their bodies.

23:13.280 --> 23:14.839
Why did they die?

23:14.920 --> 23:16.999
Why aren't they like
the girls in the school?

23:19.320 --> 23:21.999
Maybe not everyone
survives the process.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.879
You know what's dangerous about you?

23:30.960 --> 23:33.119
It's not that you make people take risks.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.359
It's that you make them
want to impress you.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.679
You make it
so they don't want to let you down.

23:41.800 --> 23:46.719

people to themselves when you're around.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.959
Then...we fill you with our blood.

It rages through you like a fire,

24:14.600 --> 24:16.119
changing you,

24:16.200 --> 24:19.439
until one morning you awake

24:19.520 --> 24:22.479
and your humanity is a dream...

24:22.560 --> 24:24.039
now faded.

you're a refugee, like me.

28:33.040 --> 28:35.799
I'll make you a deal.
An answer for an answer.

28:37.360 --> 28:40.519
You're using a perception filter.
It doesn't change your features,

28:40.600 --> 28:44.359
but manipulates the brainwaves
of the person looking at you.

28:44.440 --> 28:48.599
But seeing one of you
for the first time in, say, a mirror,

28:48.680 --> 28:53.519
the brain doesn't know what to fill
the gap with, so leaves it blank...

28:54.880 --> 28:57.079
...hence no reflection.

Self-preservation overrides the mirage.

and tries to alert the conscious brain.

- You should be in a museum.

- Or in a mausoleum.
- Why are you here?

29:21.680 --> 29:24.239
We ran from the silence.

29:24.320 --> 29:28.359
- Why are you here?
- Wedding present. The silence?

29:31.000 --> 29:32.639
There were cracks.

29:34.360 --> 29:35.919
Some were tiny...

29:38.240 --> 29:40.359
...some were as big as the sky.

29:42.360 --> 29:44.999
Through some we saw worlds and people

29:45.080 --> 29:47.959
and through others we saw silence...

29:50.000 --> 29:52.079
...and the end of all things.

29:53.640 --> 29:59.159
We fled to an ocean like ours
and the crack snapped shut behind us...

30:00.720 --> 30:02.999
...and Saturnyne was lost.

30:04.920 --> 30:07.119
So Earth is to become
Saturnyne Mark II?

30:07.200 --> 30:09.239
And you can help me.

We can build a new society here,
as others have.
