WEBVTT

00:00.050 --> 00:01.227
<i>I promised
this friend of mine</i>

00:01.252 --> 00:03.254
that I'd visit him just as
soon as I got to London,

00:03.321 --> 00:05.858
and now I'm gonna get
a chance to see him...

00:06.157 --> 00:07.761
ls something wrong?

00:07.858 --> 00:09.201
Geoffrey's dead.

00:09.260 --> 00:11.365
Some say his soul
is still trapped in there

00:11.429 --> 00:13.875
waiting to take revenge
on the men who murdered him.

00:13.931 --> 00:17.538
<i>Geoff had this feeling he could
send me signals just by concentrating.</i>

00:18.970 --> 00:20.540
Stop!

00:20.905 --> 00:22.475
Let him go!

00:22.540 --> 00:25.680
<i>You're just like him.
You're just like Geoffrey.</i>

00:28.045 --> 00:29.217
Thomas!

00:29.847 --> 00:31.155
Maybe you should go away.

00:31.215 --> 00:33.855
<i>I just don't believe
in ghost stories.</i>

00:37.154 --> 00:38.633
I think you do.

03:52.552 --> 03:53.724
Jacob.

03:53.786 --> 03:55.493
I told you before and I'm
not gonna tell you again.

03:55.555 --> 03:58.035
When the seat belt light is
on, you have to sit down!

03:58.090 --> 03:59.467
I don't want to sit down!

03:59.525 --> 04:01.664
Well, you have to sit down!
I don't care what you want.

04:01.727 --> 04:03.764
You've been so naughty.
Now sit down.

04:03.829 --> 04:06.332
You really cannot go
running up and down...

04:06.532 --> 04:09.638
Deplorable how some mothers
cannot control their children.

04:09.702 --> 04:11.181
When I...

04:13.206 --> 04:14.651
Are you all right?

04:14.707 --> 04:16.846
I just had a weird dream.

04:16.909 --> 04:19.219
I hope you enjoyed it, because
you missed the movie,

04:19.278 --> 04:20.814
you missed
the steak flambÃ©,

04:20.880 --> 04:23.884
and the complimentary after-dinner
hot towel with lemon.

04:23.950 --> 04:25.122
But most importantly,

04:25.184 --> 04:26.788
you missed the entire
discussion we were having

04:26.852 --> 04:28.957
concerning our assignment
in England.

04:29.021 --> 04:31.194
I really wanted
to see that movie.

04:31.924 --> 04:34.370
Magnum, must I remind you that
this is not a pleasure trip?

04:34.427 --> 04:37.101
We are here on urgent business
for Robin Masters.

04:37.163 --> 04:39.109
And if I cannot have your
complete attention, Higgins.

04:39.165 --> 04:41.304
Perhaps I should telephone
Mr. Masters Higgins!

04:41.367 --> 04:43.210
And inform him that
he should hire someone else.

04:43.269 --> 04:46.011
Higgins, you have
my complete attention!

04:48.341 --> 04:49.513
Very well.

04:49.575 --> 04:50.918
Perhaps we have enough time

04:50.977 --> 04:53.617
to go over the bare
essentials before we land.

04:53.679 --> 04:54.953
We're preparing
to land now, sir.

04:55.014 --> 04:57.392
You'll have to stow your briefcase
underneath the seat in front of you

04:57.450 --> 05:00.260
and bring your seat
to the full upright position.

05:11.998 --> 05:13.602
<i>There's something
very unsettling</i>

05:13.666 --> 05:16.112
<i>about waking up
abruptly from a dream.</i>

05:16.168 --> 05:19.843
<i>It's almost as if part of you gets
trapped in that cloudy dream world</i>

05:19.905 --> 05:22.818
<i>leaving you feeling
vaguely lost and uneasy.</i>

05:24.710 --> 05:26.883
<i>I couldn't remember
all the images,</i>

05:26.946 --> 05:30.792
<i>but I had a feeling I had escaped
some terrible danger by waking up.</i>

05:31.284 --> 05:32.820
<i>And I also couldn't
shake the feeling</i>

05:32.885 --> 05:35.627
<i>that the danger
was still out there, lurking,</i>

05:35.688 --> 05:38.464
<i>waiting, just out of sight.</i>

05:40.359 --> 05:43.272
Higgins, that's it!
The castle!

05:44.263 --> 05:45.799
Yes, quite.

05:45.865 --> 05:48.141
Most impressive
from the air, isn't it?

05:48.200 --> 05:50.305
No, I mean,
I saw this castle.

05:50.369 --> 05:52.610
Well, of course you did. I was
showing you aerial photographs of it

05:52.672 --> 05:54.447
when you fell asleep.

06:00.413 --> 06:01.915
Ah! Here it is.

06:01.981 --> 06:05.258
We will be met at Robin's Keep
by Ian Mackerras.

06:05.318 --> 06:08.595
Although his credentials
are sparse, to say the least,

06:08.654 --> 06:10.998
Mr. Masters seems to feel
that he has the makings

06:11.057 --> 06:12.866
of a first-rate major-domo.

06:20.166 --> 06:22.669
Ian Mackerras
at your service, sir.

06:22.735 --> 06:24.442
I'm Jonathan Quayle Higgins
and this...

06:24.503 --> 06:25.709
I'm sorry?

06:25.771 --> 06:27.808
I said I am
Jonathan Quayle Higgins...

06:27.873 --> 06:29.284
Yes, of course, Mr. Higgins.

06:29.342 --> 06:30.878
Allow me to
take your luggage, sir.

06:30.943 --> 06:32.718
No, thank you,
I can manage myself.

06:32.778 --> 06:34.155
No, I've got it.

06:44.357 --> 06:46.359
I'm sure he's just
trying to do his job.

06:46.425 --> 06:48.371
Yes, well,

06:48.427 --> 06:51.499
he appears to be even less
qualified to run Robin's Keep

06:51.564 --> 06:53.373
than I had hoped.

06:53.432 --> 06:54.672
Here is another copy
of our schedule,

06:54.734 --> 06:56.873
beginning with this
afternoon's appointments.

06:56.936 --> 06:58.916
Try not to misplace
this one.

06:58.971 --> 07:00.917
Oh, about this afternoon,
Higgins,

07:00.973 --> 07:03.817
there's something I kind of
forgot to tell you about.

07:03.876 --> 07:05.549
Luggage all taken care of.

07:05.611 --> 07:08.182
I wager you'll be wanting a
full tour of the castle now,

07:08.247 --> 07:10.193
from the gate house
to the gloriettas.

07:10.249 --> 07:12.957
I think you'll find our
heraldry room fascinating.

07:13.018 --> 07:16.192
We have housekeeping records
dating back to 1422.

07:16.255 --> 07:18.701
Ian, perhaps it would be a
more efficient use of our time

07:18.758 --> 07:21.398
if we took the tour
with the security advisor.

07:21.460 --> 07:23.440
The security advisor.

07:23.496 --> 07:26.500
You have set an appointment to interview
a security advisor from Guardmor?

07:26.565 --> 07:28.909
Oh, certainly. Yes, indeed.
All taken care of.

07:28.968 --> 07:32.472
And he's meeting us here this afternoon
per our discussed itinerary?

07:32.538 --> 07:34.415
Not quite this afternoon.

07:35.541 --> 07:36.884
What do you mean,
not quite this afternoon?

07:36.942 --> 07:39.548
Either he is meeting us here
this afternoon or he isn't.

07:39.612 --> 07:41.182
He isn't.
That's great.

07:41.247 --> 07:42.590
What are you talking about?

07:42.648 --> 07:44.059
Well, I sort of
made other plans.

07:44.116 --> 07:45.720
You assured me you would
schedule an appointment.

07:45.785 --> 07:48.766
Well, I did, but he sent word
to say his sister's wedding

07:48.821 --> 07:52.132
had been unexpectedly
brought forward six months.

07:52.191 --> 07:54.330
What you Yanks call a
shotgun affair, I believe.

07:54.393 --> 07:57.203
Anyway, I didn't see any harm in
rescheduling it for tomorrow.

07:57.263 --> 07:58.901
No harm at all.

07:59.265 --> 08:01.768
Isn't that funny, how things have
a way of working out, Higgins?

08:01.834 --> 08:04.314
I mean, I sort of promised this
friend of mine, Geoffrey St. Clair...

08:04.370 --> 08:05.747
You remember,
I told you about him.

08:05.805 --> 08:08.081
...that I'd visit him just
as soon as I got to London,

08:08.140 --> 08:09.642
and now I'm gonna get
a chance to see him

08:09.708 --> 08:11.210
and everything's
gonna work out fine.

08:11.277 --> 08:12.654
And you get to
see your family.

08:12.711 --> 08:15.988
Oh, quite, you needn't be here
when they connect the phone.

08:16.682 --> 08:18.457
There are no phones?

08:18.717 --> 08:20.719
Well, there was
a long waiting list.

08:20.786 --> 08:23.995
Have you done nothing to prepare
for Mr. Master's arrival?

08:24.056 --> 08:25.694
Oh, yes. I...

08:26.058 --> 08:28.334
I scheduled the interviews
for the house staff.

08:28.394 --> 08:30.169
They should be
arriving any moment.

08:30.229 --> 08:31.731
But you go ahead
and see your family.

08:31.797 --> 08:33.902
I can conduct
the interviews myself.

08:33.966 --> 08:35.808
I think you'll find
I have a discerning eye

08:35.868 --> 08:37.643
and a keen sense of character.

08:37.703 --> 08:39.943
No, no, my family
will have to wait.

08:40.005 --> 08:42.451
Mr. Masters has entrusted me
with the responsibility

08:42.508 --> 08:44.181
of overseeing
all the preparations.

08:44.243 --> 08:47.554
That would certainly include the hiring
of household staff. I shall stay.

08:47.613 --> 08:49.024
I shall not.

08:49.715 --> 08:52.127
And how do you propose
to get into town?

08:52.785 --> 08:56.198
Well, I kind of thought
Robin might have a car.

08:56.255 --> 08:57.996
I'm afraid
they haven't arrived yet.

08:58.057 --> 09:00.537
Apart from an old one
that came with the castle.

09:00.593 --> 09:02.903
I'm sure that
will do just fine.

09:07.833 --> 09:09.642
You said old car.

09:09.702 --> 09:11.340
You didn't say classic.

09:11.403 --> 09:12.609
Magnum,
on second thought...

09:12.671 --> 09:14.480
Higgins, don't even say it.

09:14.540 --> 09:18.181
I'm a grown man, I've driven
everything from bicycles to tanks,

09:18.244 --> 09:19.746
and I am perfectly capable

09:19.812 --> 09:23.419
of driving this car into
London without any trouble.

09:27.620 --> 09:30.191
Would you like me to give
you directions? No, no.

09:30.256 --> 09:32.759
I have the address.
I'll find it.

09:40.332 --> 09:43.279
Don't forget! Left-hand
side of the road!

10:09.628 --> 10:11.369
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

10:11.430 --> 10:13.933
<i>Any reasonable person
would have gotten directions</i>

10:13.999 --> 10:16.070
<i>before driving off.</i>

10:16.135 --> 10:19.605
<i>But my friendship with Geoffrey
went a little beyond reason.</i>

10:21.407 --> 10:23.853
<i>There was this game
we used to play sometimes</i>

10:23.909 --> 10:26.355
<i>when we were on missions
together in Vietnam.</i>

10:26.412 --> 10:27.948
<i>A survival game.</i>

10:29.682 --> 10:32.663
<i>Anyway, Geoffrey had
a new variation on the game.</i>

10:32.718 --> 10:34.857
<i>He wanted to see if he could
get me to his neighborhood</i>

10:34.920 --> 10:36.763
<i>by "thinking meâ there.</i>

10:39.058 --> 10:42.301
<i>And I guess I was a little
curious to see if it could work.</i>

10:46.031 --> 10:49.410
<i>Obviously he hadn't
worked out all the kinks yet.</i>

10:49.468 --> 10:51.106
<i>I realized I was going
to have to find it</i>

10:51.170 --> 10:53.150
<i>by more
conventional methods.</i>

11:32.478 --> 11:33.752
Sorry.

11:36.949 --> 11:39.486
I was looking
for Geoffrey St. Clair.

11:39.952 --> 11:41.260
I knocked.

11:42.554 --> 11:44.397
Mr. Magnum?

11:44.456 --> 11:46.697
Thomas. I spoke to Geoff
last week.

11:47.593 --> 11:50.699
Yes, yes.
He was expecting you.

11:52.231 --> 11:53.733
But he's...

11:55.601 --> 11:59.378
He's been called out of town
unexpectedly.

12:00.305 --> 12:02.512
Well, I should've called.
I'm sorry.

12:04.476 --> 12:06.012
I'll come back later.

12:06.078 --> 12:07.955
No, please. I...

12:09.915 --> 12:11.690
How stupid of me.

12:12.051 --> 12:13.724
I'm Penelope.

12:14.086 --> 12:15.690
Geoffrey's wife.

12:16.088 --> 12:17.692
I've seen your paintings.

12:17.756 --> 12:20.464
I've really been looking
forward to meeting you.

12:21.060 --> 12:22.767
Is something wrong?

12:23.295 --> 12:24.740
He was...

12:26.265 --> 12:31.681
...so anxious
about your trip here.

12:33.539 --> 12:35.280
He said,

12:37.142 --> 12:39.315
when you got here,

12:39.978 --> 12:43.187
there were things he wanted
to talk to you about.

12:46.552 --> 12:48.031
Things

12:50.656 --> 12:53.227
no one else
would understand.

12:56.161 --> 12:58.767
He wanted your visit
to go just right.

12:59.298 --> 13:00.777
What's wrong?

13:03.102 --> 13:04.911
He isn't coming back.

13:07.406 --> 13:10.478
I've just had a phone call
from the police.

13:14.313 --> 13:16.259
Geoffrey's been
in an accident.

13:20.519 --> 13:23.056
He's dead.

13:34.299 --> 13:37.109
Is that your husband,
Mrs. St. Clair?

13:37.169 --> 13:39.649
Yes. That's Geoffrey.

13:40.572 --> 13:42.984
I'll need a signature
for the belongings.

13:43.375 --> 13:44.820
I---

13:45.644 --> 13:46.918
Is it very close in here?

13:46.979 --> 13:48.515
You want to sit down?

13:49.248 --> 13:53.321
No, I think I need
some fresh air.

13:53.385 --> 13:54.659
All right.

13:54.720 --> 13:57.064
Maybe you could sign
for his things.

13:57.823 --> 14:00.326
Of course. You okay?

14:01.226 --> 14:03.137
I'll wait for you downstairs.

14:05.798 --> 14:08.677
Looks like the bloke
was on his way to play squash.

14:08.734 --> 14:11.237
Crossing the street, bam!
Hit by a car.

14:14.173 --> 14:15.618
What kind of car?

14:16.742 --> 14:20.019
Black Jaguar, they said.
Never stopped.

14:23.582 --> 14:26.119
So, racket,

14:26.852 --> 14:30.766
shorts, shirts,
trainers, towel,

14:30.956 --> 14:32.958
and a hotel room key.

14:33.325 --> 14:36.135
Your friend was staying
at the Carlsboro.

14:36.728 --> 14:38.105
Sort of ironic, isn't it?

14:38.163 --> 14:39.665
Man's goes out
to play squash,

14:39.731 --> 14:42.371
keep himself fit,
gets killed.

14:45.637 --> 14:48.641
The Carlsboro in Paris?

14:48.707 --> 14:50.846
No, London.

15:16.201 --> 15:19.205
What the hell was he doing
crossing the road in London?

15:19.271 --> 15:20.807
He was supposed
to be in Paris!

15:20.873 --> 15:23.114
I took him
to the station myself.

15:23.408 --> 15:25.046
I'm sorry.

15:26.912 --> 15:29.916
I suppose I ought to get
in touch with his family.

15:31.216 --> 15:35.130
They'll want to come up to London and
make the arrangements themselves.

15:37.556 --> 15:41.436
I couldn't have got
through this without you.

15:41.493 --> 15:43.131
Thank you.

15:43.195 --> 15:44.435
Oh, I...

15:46.265 --> 15:47.801
It's odd.

15:48.767 --> 15:51.839
There was no other person
I could turn to.

15:54.006 --> 15:56.953
Perhaps that's why you
came along when you did.

15:57.009 --> 15:58.545
Maybe.

16:03.048 --> 16:06.427
Phone me before you leave.
I'd like to say goodbye.

16:11.423 --> 16:13.266
Don't you want me
to drive you home?

16:13.325 --> 16:16.135
Oh, no, thank you. I...

16:17.129 --> 16:19.609
I'd like to spend
a little time on my own.

16:24.303 --> 16:29.446
Well, I must say, it's been
lovely chatting to you two gentlemen.

16:29.508 --> 16:32.421
It certainly does set a girl's
mind at ease knowing that,

16:32.477 --> 16:34.354
you know, not everyone
who lives in a castle

16:34.413 --> 16:37.656
is as low-minded as Lord
Ashdale over at Dorking.

16:38.116 --> 16:40.756
I remember
one Sunday morning...

16:40.819 --> 16:43.823
Now, mind you,
all the family's at church,

16:43.889 --> 16:46.233
or at least they're
supposed to be.

16:46.758 --> 16:50.035
Well, I'm bending
over the fireplace,

16:50.095 --> 16:51.802
poking the embers,

16:52.731 --> 16:55.405
when all of a sudden
he came up right behind me,

16:55.467 --> 16:57.071
and would you believe what...
Miss Mumford.

16:57.135 --> 16:59.877
I'm afraid we don't really
have time for another story.

16:59.938 --> 17:01.645
Amusing as they are.

17:02.975 --> 17:04.420
Of course.

17:05.277 --> 17:08.416
So, when you gonna be
hiring people on, then?

17:08.480 --> 17:09.788
Oh, right away.

17:10.281 --> 17:11.589
We'll let you know.

17:11.650 --> 17:13.357
Thank you for coming by.

17:13.452 --> 17:16.022
Thank you.
Well, goodbye, then.

17:16.088 --> 17:17.362
Good day.

17:21.126 --> 17:24.232
Well, I think we can definitely
put Millicent in the...

17:24.296 --> 17:26.833
Miss Mumford
in the "hire" category.

17:26.897 --> 17:29.105
Shall we say,
upstairs maid?

17:33.939 --> 17:36.749
I could just pencil her in
on the kitchen staff.

17:39.511 --> 17:41.252
Oh, you didn't take
all that nonsense

17:41.313 --> 17:44.157
about the missing silver
service to heart, did you?

17:44.282 --> 17:48.196
Because I mean, well, everyone
makes a mistake or two in life.

17:48.253 --> 17:49.823
I thought
it was quite touching

17:49.888 --> 17:52.459
the way she even told us
about the incident.

17:52.524 --> 17:54.401
It sort of proves
she isn't a thief,

17:54.459 --> 17:56.439
in an odd sort of way.

17:56.762 --> 18:00.369
She spent four years
in prison.

18:02.434 --> 18:03.845
Well, there you are.

18:03.902 --> 18:06.439
She's paid her debt
to society, hasn't she?

18:10.008 --> 18:11.351
Tell me.

18:12.077 --> 18:16.992
What actually inspired you
to get into this line of work?

18:18.517 --> 18:19.996
Oh, I don't know.

18:20.519 --> 18:24.023
I suppose I just have
a natural inclination for it.

18:28.827 --> 18:30.636
My God! What is that?

18:31.029 --> 18:35.273
The front door chime.
It is a rather large castle.

18:46.845 --> 18:48.051
What a doorbell!

18:48.113 --> 18:50.787
It reminds me of one of those
old English movies!

18:54.386 --> 18:56.992
That has to be the loudest
noise in the world.

18:57.589 --> 19:00.968
Hey, Higgins!
Higgins, where are you?

19:01.026 --> 19:02.937
Second loudest.

19:03.328 --> 19:04.636
Rick?

19:04.696 --> 19:05.800
Here you are.

19:05.864 --> 19:08.242
What a place!
It's a castle!

19:08.300 --> 19:09.540
What are you doing here?

19:09.601 --> 19:11.274
You didn't think
I'd let you down, did you?

19:11.336 --> 19:13.907
Let me down?
Or Robin?

19:14.439 --> 19:16.544
What are you talking about?

19:16.942 --> 19:19.582
Who's running
the King Kamehameha Club?

19:20.612 --> 19:22.023
Not T.C.?

19:22.581 --> 19:24.083
No, he's right behind me.

19:24.149 --> 19:26.561
No, no. What I mean is,
he's on another flight.

19:26.618 --> 19:29.189
You see, he had some
last minute charters to fly.

19:29.254 --> 19:31.700
I got him a great deal
on a night flight.

19:31.756 --> 19:33.099
He saved
a ton of coconuts.

19:33.158 --> 19:36.071
I repeat.
What are you doing here?

19:36.495 --> 19:38.702
T.C. and I decided
to help you out, you know.

19:38.763 --> 19:40.470
No, I don't know!

19:40.632 --> 19:43.340
Well, we got to thinking that it
really wasn't fair for you and Thomas

19:43.401 --> 19:45.403
to do all the work
setting up Robin's Keep.

19:45.470 --> 19:47.711
So we jumped
a jet and here we are!

19:47.772 --> 19:49.445
Or rather here I am.

19:49.508 --> 19:50.851
Thomas said
there wouldn't be a problem.

19:50.909 --> 19:52.252
Where is he, anyway?

19:52.310 --> 19:55.689
Hey, Thomas! Thomas!

19:59.751 --> 20:03.426
<i>The first time I left
home, I had a terrible nightmare.</i>

20:03.488 --> 20:07.129
<i>I was lost in a strange city and
no matter how many turns I took,</i>

20:07.192 --> 20:08.899
<i>I couldn't get out.</i>

20:08.960 --> 20:12.407
<i>I kept getting drawn in
deeper and deeper.</i>

20:15.500 --> 20:17.639
<i>As I left the morgue,
I tried to convince myself</i>

20:17.702 --> 20:19.773
<i>that it was my idea
to go for a walk,</i>

20:19.838 --> 20:21.909
<i>to sort things out in my mind.</i>

20:28.280 --> 20:31.454
<i>But I realized as I came upon
the Carlsboro Hotel</i>

20:31.516 --> 20:34.122
<i>that the walk was never
my idea to begin with.</i>

20:34.186 --> 20:35.961
<i>Some force
had brought me there</i>

20:36.021 --> 20:38.399
<i>and it wasn't going to
let me walk away.</i>

20:59.144 --> 21:00.452
Help you?

21:08.486 --> 21:09.487
Sir?

21:11.022 --> 21:12.228
No, I'm fine.

21:17.262 --> 21:18.468
Reception.

22:26.798 --> 22:28.436
If you want to
make up the beds,

22:28.500 --> 22:30.537
I'm afraid
you're a little late.

22:37.676 --> 22:40.020
I'm a friend
of Geoffrey St. Clair.

22:40.845 --> 22:42.449
He gave you the key?

22:44.316 --> 22:45.886
Not exactly.

22:48.653 --> 22:50.030
Look,

22:50.522 --> 22:54.299
I don't know how to say this,
except just to say it.

22:54.359 --> 22:56.361
There's been an accident.

22:57.829 --> 22:59.274
Geoffrey's dead.

23:09.174 --> 23:10.551
You can't involve me!

23:10.608 --> 23:13.111
You can't!
It will ruin my marriage!

23:14.779 --> 23:17.055
My husband
wouldn't understand!

23:17.649 --> 23:19.060
Not many do.

23:19.117 --> 23:21.495
Oh, please,
I was lonely.

23:22.320 --> 23:24.527
Edward is an engineer.

23:24.589 --> 23:27.934
He travels a lot. He works seven days
a week and never even has time...

23:27.992 --> 23:31.462
You don't have to explain why
you and Geoff were here.

23:33.698 --> 23:38.204
I just don't want you to think I'm
some sort of a tramp, that's all.

23:42.207 --> 23:44.983
Geoff, how could you?

23:46.211 --> 23:48.248
I don't think
it was intentional.

23:49.114 --> 23:50.286
Of course not.

23:50.348 --> 23:53.329
I didn't mean he committed suicide.
I just meant...

23:56.554 --> 23:58.465
I don't know what I meant.

24:02.594 --> 24:05.006
His wife thinks
he went to Paris.

24:05.463 --> 24:06.908
I know.

24:11.403 --> 24:12.939
What do I tell her?

24:15.740 --> 24:17.879
You said it was an accident.

24:19.911 --> 24:22.448
Couldn't you tell her
he was back in London,

24:22.514 --> 24:23.993
coming home?

24:24.048 --> 24:26.494
Without his luggage
and in gym clothes?

24:30.054 --> 24:31.397
What is it?

24:32.123 --> 24:34.262
It's nothing.
It's just a splinter.

24:35.160 --> 24:39.040
This isn't the best of hotels,
I know, but it's... Well...

24:39.097 --> 24:40.508
Discreet.

24:49.140 --> 24:51.120
Are you going
to tell his wife?

26:05.283 --> 26:07.058
Oh, Thomas. I'm so glad to see you!
I...

26:07.118 --> 26:08.961
The police are here.

26:09.020 --> 26:11.091
They think
Geoffrey was murdered!

26:18.245 --> 26:20.987
She was told
it was a hit and run accident.

26:21.048 --> 26:23.688
Yes, well, that was
our initial reaction.

26:23.751 --> 26:25.992
But as I was saying
to Mrs. St. Clair here,

26:26.053 --> 26:28.329
the circumstances
of her husband's death,

26:28.389 --> 26:29.993
plus the fact that
she was telling me

26:30.057 --> 26:31.263
he was supposed to be
in Paris

26:31.325 --> 26:33.862
on a book signing tour,
was it?

26:33.928 --> 26:35.202
Yes.

26:35.262 --> 26:39.574
All point rather conclusively to
the possibility of foul play.

26:40.968 --> 26:43.915
You were going to look
for those papers for me?

26:43.971 --> 26:45.245
Oh, yes. Of course.

26:45.306 --> 26:46.808
I'll be right back.

26:49.710 --> 26:51.121
What papers?

26:51.245 --> 26:53.282
Correspondence,
address books,

26:53.347 --> 26:56.328
anything that might lead
to a suspect or a motive.

26:56.383 --> 26:57.657
Have you located
the car yet?

26:57.718 --> 26:58.788
Hmm?

26:58.852 --> 27:01.025
The black Jaguar.
Have you found it?

27:01.889 --> 27:03.129
Oh, no.

27:03.190 --> 27:04.931
No one actually
saw the number plate.

27:04.992 --> 27:06.801
It's going to be difficult.

27:11.031 --> 27:12.169
I...
Did you know that...

27:12.233 --> 27:13.610
Please, carry on.

27:15.035 --> 27:16.446
Well...

27:17.171 --> 27:18.275
There's something...

27:18.339 --> 27:21.752
It probably doesn't have anything
to do with Geoff's death.

27:22.042 --> 27:23.146
I'd say, at the moment,

27:23.210 --> 27:25.747
that almost anything could have
something to do with his death.

27:25.813 --> 27:27.850
Well, if it doesn't have
anything to do with his death,

27:27.915 --> 27:30.555
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't tell Penelope.

27:32.886 --> 27:35.765
He was carrying this
at the time of...

27:36.557 --> 27:38.161
When he was hit.

27:38.225 --> 27:40.728
It's to a room
at the Carlsboro.

27:43.530 --> 27:46.067
Geoff was having an affair.

27:47.635 --> 27:48.875
Oh, dear.

27:49.637 --> 27:52.743
And that's why he
didn't go to Paris.

27:53.841 --> 27:55.377
Do you know who with?

27:56.010 --> 27:57.853
Well, she was there.

27:57.911 --> 27:59.549
I didn't think it was
any of my business.

27:59.613 --> 28:02.321
I mean, having an affair
isn't exactly against the law.

28:02.383 --> 28:03.623
Quite.

28:03.684 --> 28:04.992
But you did see her?

28:05.052 --> 28:06.725
Yes, in that room.

28:06.787 --> 28:10.291
Here's his business card file
and personal address book.

28:12.793 --> 28:14.295
What is it?

28:15.229 --> 28:19.143
I was just telling Mr. Magnum,
I'm a big admirer of yours.

28:19.199 --> 28:21.509
I own one of your watercolors.

28:22.369 --> 28:24.576
A landscape.
The mill at Dempton.

28:24.638 --> 28:26.083
It's only a small one,

28:26.140 --> 28:29.019
but on a police inspector's
salary, all I can afford.

28:29.576 --> 28:31.419
How kind of you to say that.

28:31.478 --> 28:33.389
Yes, well... Thank you.

28:35.849 --> 28:38.455
Oh. If either of you should
come up with anything,

28:38.519 --> 28:40.294
even in the slightest bit
suspicious,

28:40.354 --> 28:42.698
please call me
on this number.

28:43.123 --> 28:44.568
Thank you. Goodbye.

28:44.625 --> 28:45.763
Goodbye.

28:46.393 --> 28:50.864
I don't think I can take
many more surprises.

29:02.409 --> 29:04.355
If you like,
I could pick up the menu

29:04.411 --> 29:05.788
while you visit the family.

29:05.846 --> 29:07.792
No, I...

29:14.188 --> 29:15.929
The phones have
been connected!

29:15.989 --> 29:17.468
I'll get it.

29:19.660 --> 29:21.139
Robin's Keep.

29:21.929 --> 29:24.569
Yeah, we'll accept the charges.
Charges?

29:24.798 --> 29:26.175
Hey, T.C.,
you at Gatwick?

29:26.233 --> 29:28.873
No, I am not
at Gatwick Airport!

29:29.803 --> 29:31.510
Jeez, you don't
have to be so hostile.

29:31.572 --> 29:35.349
Hostile? You have not yet
begun to see hostile.

29:35.476 --> 29:38.013
<i>You put me on a plane
that was supposed to fly</i>

29:38.078 --> 29:40.820
from Honolulu
to Rio to London.

29:40.881 --> 29:42.883
<i>Look, I flew the same route,
you know.</i>

29:42.950 --> 29:45.624
I mean, it was the only way
that we could fly half-price.

29:45.686 --> 29:46.960
It was a great deal.

29:47.020 --> 29:49.057
Yeah, if you want
to go to Morocco.

29:49.123 --> 29:50.602
Morocco?

29:50.657 --> 29:52.068
What are you
doing in Morocco?

29:52.126 --> 29:54.163
He's calling from Morocco?

29:54.528 --> 29:57.134
I suggest you find out!

29:57.197 --> 29:59.040
<i>Now, I have tickets to
the Royal Opera.</i>

29:59.099 --> 30:00.339
<i>I have tickets to the ballet.</i>

30:00.401 --> 30:02.608
I have the tickets
to Ntozake Shange's play.

30:02.669 --> 30:05.775
The only thing I don't have is
a ticket to Gatwick Airport

30:05.839 --> 30:09.685
and I can't get one because all the
flights out of here are booked!

30:09.843 --> 30:11.322
All right, look,
just don't worry about it.

30:11.378 --> 30:13.654
I'll call Tammy's Travel. I'll
take care of it right away.

30:13.714 --> 30:16.422
Well, you do that, because I
have been trying to reach her.

30:16.483 --> 30:18.326
And if I miss
the ballet tomorrow,

30:18.385 --> 30:22.527
you are going to truly understand
the meaning of the word hostile!

30:23.090 --> 30:24.296
T.C.?

30:30.030 --> 30:31.941
There's been a slight problem
with his travel arrangements.

30:31.999 --> 30:33.672
Nothing I can't
straighten out.

30:33.734 --> 30:36.180
How do you call Hawaii?
You don't.

30:36.236 --> 30:37.340
I'll charge it.

30:40.607 --> 30:43.087
I told you
to have that disconnected!

30:43.143 --> 30:45.783
The man's coming tomorrow
to change it.

30:59.293 --> 31:01.102
Don't ring it!

31:02.029 --> 31:03.975
Hi, Higgins.
Don't "Hi, Higgins" me.

31:04.031 --> 31:06.272
Rick has arrived.
Rick's here? That's great.

31:06.333 --> 31:09.405
I have a staff to train, food
to prepare, musicians to hire,

31:09.470 --> 31:11.677
an endless assortment
of odd jobs to complete

31:11.738 --> 31:13.046
before Mr. Masters' party

31:13.106 --> 31:15.279
and you've been out
cavorting about.

31:16.810 --> 31:19.086
What have you got
to say for yourself?

31:19.880 --> 31:22.087
Geoffrey St. Clair's
been killed.

31:45.405 --> 31:48.386
Higgins, you know that dream
I was telling you about?

31:48.509 --> 31:50.182
The one on the plane?

31:52.179 --> 31:55.626
There was this car,
it was coming straight at me.

31:58.619 --> 31:59.825
I don't know,

32:05.592 --> 32:08.198
but it seems from
what I can find out,

32:11.164 --> 32:14.043
that I was dreaming
about Geoffrey's accident

32:14.101 --> 32:16.206
at the same time
it was happening.

32:17.704 --> 32:19.377
How could that be possible?

32:19.439 --> 32:20.679
I don't know.

32:21.909 --> 32:24.014
I went to the hotel,
the Carlsboro.

32:25.345 --> 32:28.292
It's almost exactly like
it was in my dream.

32:30.384 --> 32:32.694
Well, don't you think
it more likely that,

32:32.753 --> 32:34.596
having seen the hotel,

32:34.855 --> 32:37.165
you now think it's like
the one in your dream?

32:37.224 --> 32:39.135
That's logical.

32:40.127 --> 32:41.765
That's very logical.

32:45.399 --> 32:46.878
No, you're right, Higgins.

32:46.934 --> 32:48.174
It's just...

32:52.339 --> 32:54.615
If someone did kill Geoff,

32:55.709 --> 32:57.916
I owe it to him
to try and find out.

33:00.180 --> 33:01.955
The funeral is tomorrow.

33:02.115 --> 33:03.856
So soon?

33:09.523 --> 33:11.935
I promised Penelope
I'd be there.

33:17.297 --> 33:20.176
...our Lord Jesus
Christ, and the love of God,

33:20.233 --> 33:24.238
and the fellowship of the Holy
Ghost, be with us all evermore.

33:24.304 --> 33:25.339
Amen.

33:25.405 --> 33:27.351
Amen.

33:27.407 --> 33:30.251
<i>I know what you're thinking.
And you're right.</i>

33:30.310 --> 33:32.221
<i>I mean, sure,
I believe in fate,</i>

33:32.279 --> 33:34.190
<i>even in my little voice,</i>

33:34.247 --> 33:36.591
<i>but to believe that
whatever was in Geoff's mind</i>

33:36.650 --> 33:39.927
<i>at the time of his death
somehow ended up in mine,</i>

33:39.987 --> 33:41.625
<i>I mean, that would be crazy.</i>

33:41.688 --> 33:43.690
<i>But what reasonable
explanation could there be</i>

33:43.757 --> 33:46.465
<i>for the feeling I'd had
ever since I came to London?</i>

33:46.526 --> 33:49.564
That, somehow,
<i>I</i> had been here before.

34:26.533 --> 34:28.444
I was leaving Geoff.

34:29.603 --> 34:31.378
The only thing that
makes me feel terrible

34:31.438 --> 34:35.351
was that I
wasn't going to tell him.

34:37.543 --> 34:40.991
I was going to slip away
while he was in Paris,

34:42.081 --> 34:44.221
like a thief in the night.

34:45.252 --> 34:47.822
That's why everything in
the flat was covered.

34:48.388 --> 34:50.664
I think there's a car
following us.

34:51.491 --> 34:53.300
A black Jaguar.

34:59.199 --> 35:00.234
Hold on.

35:16.183 --> 35:17.753
Thomas!

35:24.091 --> 35:26.298
Thomas, stop!

35:26.359 --> 35:27.963
Let him go!

35:45.746 --> 35:47.487
Thomas!

35:52.452 --> 35:54.022
Penelope!

35:58.225 --> 36:00.068
You're just like him.

36:00.994 --> 36:03.031
You're just like Geoffrey.

36:11.438 --> 36:14.817
I'm afraid I didn't get
the license number on the car.

36:15.308 --> 36:18.778
Well, at least we have a description
of the man you saw at the cemetery.

36:18.845 --> 36:21.086
I'll see what I can turn up.

36:21.148 --> 36:23.458
If you come across anything,
however unimportant it is...

36:23.517 --> 36:25.861
Yes. Yes, I'll ring you
right away.

36:25.919 --> 36:27.660
I'll see myself out.

36:31.158 --> 36:33.695
Well, I'd best be
on my way, as well.

36:34.394 --> 36:36.931
It was so thoughtful of you
to bring the basket of food.

36:36.997 --> 36:39.102
Are you sure you won't stay and share it?
There's plenty.

36:39.166 --> 36:40.338
No. No. Thank you.

36:40.400 --> 36:42.846
I just thought as long as I was
driving in this direction.

36:42.903 --> 36:44.211
Oh, the cars have arrived?

36:44.271 --> 36:46.251
Not yet. I rented one.

36:46.773 --> 36:50.778
Well, I'll say good day. And again, Mrs. St.
Clair, my deepest sympathies.

36:50.844 --> 36:51.982
Thank you.

36:52.212 --> 36:53.589
I'll walk you out.

37:11.832 --> 37:13.869
She's very beautiful,
isn't she?

37:16.469 --> 37:17.914
How's your family?

37:18.738 --> 37:22.379
Oh, I haven't had a chance
to ring them yet.

37:22.442 --> 37:25.514
I'm afraid the preparations
of Robin's Keep

37:25.579 --> 37:28.321
have kept me
rather occupied.

37:28.815 --> 37:31.728
I'm sure they'll understand,
duty before pleasure.

37:31.785 --> 37:35.494
I'll drop around when things
are a bit more organized.

37:35.956 --> 37:37.458
Well, I'm gonna stay here
for a while,

37:37.524 --> 37:39.401
help Penelope
go through Geoff's things.

37:39.459 --> 37:41.268
Maybe we can
find something.

37:41.595 --> 37:46.635
You said, driving the car before,
you felt it wasn't like you.

37:46.700 --> 37:50.671
No. Actually, I said
it wasn't me.

37:50.737 --> 37:52.512
Geoff had this feeling

37:52.572 --> 37:55.746
that he could send me signals
just by concentrating.

37:57.344 --> 37:59.051
Sort of mental telepathy?

37:59.112 --> 38:00.284
Yeah. I guess.

38:00.347 --> 38:02.520
I mean, I used to make
a big joke out of it, but...

38:02.582 --> 38:03.720
But it worked.

38:03.783 --> 38:04.921
Well, I don't know how else
to explain it,

38:04.985 --> 38:07.522
some of the close calls
we got out of.

38:09.422 --> 38:11.800
Higgins, I know
this sounds crazy,

38:16.363 --> 38:22.177
but I seem to be
acting like Geoff,

38:22.235 --> 38:24.442
and maybe
I'm thinking like him.

38:25.639 --> 38:27.084
But why?

38:28.375 --> 38:30.412
To track down
whoever killed him.

38:32.512 --> 38:34.549
You will be careful?

38:52.699 --> 38:54.906
Higgins, the left side!

40:36.436 --> 40:39.974
I don't think he had
a very happy childhood.

40:40.040 --> 40:42.646
You know, he didn't keep
any keepsakes.

40:43.176 --> 40:45.520
Had no report cards,

40:45.578 --> 40:48.184
photos with school chums,
that sort of thing.

40:49.249 --> 40:53.356
But he did start this
photo album in Vietnam.

40:55.188 --> 40:57.065
Yeah, I'd forgotten
about these.

40:57.123 --> 41:00.036
He liked to take a picture
of us before each mission.

41:02.295 --> 41:04.366
Here's one with you.
Oh, yeah.

41:06.199 --> 41:07.337
Oh, there's another one.

41:07.400 --> 41:09.505
There's one with Griff.

41:12.172 --> 41:13.742
Oh, Eddie.

41:16.142 --> 41:17.553
What is it?

41:18.378 --> 41:21.450
Eddie used to
do imitations. He...

41:22.615 --> 41:24.754
I mean, you couldn't believe
how good he was at it.

41:24.818 --> 41:27.230
He used to do Cagney,
you know, and Jimmy Stewart,

41:27.287 --> 41:31.099
the usual ones, but he also used to
do the guys in the unit, you know.

41:32.325 --> 41:34.271
He used to do our C.O.

41:37.430 --> 41:39.171
He didn't come back?

41:47.440 --> 41:49.511
Perhaps you'd like this.

41:53.613 --> 41:54.956
Thank you.

42:03.423 --> 42:05.733
That's odd.
What?

42:06.392 --> 42:08.736
There are some missing.

42:11.898 --> 42:14.037
You remember
what they were?

42:14.134 --> 42:15.738
Touristy stuff.

42:17.070 --> 42:19.550
Snaps of him
in front of the pyramids.

42:19.806 --> 42:23.686
His trip to Nicaragua. India.

42:27.747 --> 42:29.749
He used to send them to me

42:31.451 --> 42:33.954
with the place and dates
on the back,

42:37.490 --> 42:41.563
and I'd put them
in his album.

42:49.202 --> 42:52.411
When we were first married,
I traveled with him.

42:56.543 --> 42:59.114
But after a while,
he started making excuses.

43:01.915 --> 43:04.555
Seems he just wanted
to be alone.

43:10.523 --> 43:13.561
At first, I thought there was
something wrong with me,

43:14.594 --> 43:17.131
but I soon came to realize

43:18.898 --> 43:21.310
that I had one place
in his life,

43:23.336 --> 43:25.009
his work another.

43:27.106 --> 43:29.450
And there were
to be no overlaps.

43:30.877 --> 43:32.515
It was all right.

43:34.414 --> 43:36.587
It meant I had

43:37.483 --> 43:40.157
time to concentrate
on my painting.

43:44.324 --> 43:45.860
Sun,

43:48.161 --> 43:50.732
we grew so far apart.

43:55.735 --> 43:57.043
It's funny.

44:00.073 --> 44:01.279
What?

44:03.710 --> 44:05.280
Oh, nothing.
What?

44:05.345 --> 44:07.086
No, you'd think I was mad.

44:07.847 --> 44:09.588
What's so bad about that?

44:10.283 --> 44:12.490
What's bad about being mad?

44:12.885 --> 44:15.559
All my best friends are.
Ask Higgins.

44:16.756 --> 44:19.635
And I have been told
that I, myself, at times,

44:19.692 --> 44:21.797
lean towards madness.

44:24.631 --> 44:26.167
I think you do.

44:28.067 --> 44:29.978
So what have you got to lose?

44:32.772 --> 44:35.275
When you arrived
at the flat yesterday,

44:38.511 --> 44:40.684
I thought for just a second

44:40.747 --> 44:43.990
that Geoffrey had walked
into the room.

44:45.918 --> 44:48.558
The old Geoffrey.
The one I fell in love with.

44:49.355 --> 44:52.165
The one who made me laugh

44:52.225 --> 44:55.229
and feel alive and pretty.

44:56.062 --> 44:57.473
Pretty?

44:59.532 --> 45:02.445
How could you ever not think
you were pretty?

45:03.403 --> 45:05.041
I think you're the...

45:09.876 --> 45:11.947
I think you're beautiful.

45:15.682 --> 45:17.389
Then you're mad.

45:17.650 --> 45:18.890
Am I?

46:55.915 --> 46:57.223
Excuse me.

47:02.422 --> 47:04.732
I'm afraid my French
is a bit rusty.

47:04.791 --> 47:07.362
You wouldn't happen
to speak English, would you?

47:07.427 --> 47:08.735
Enough.

47:08.795 --> 47:10.069
Oh, good.

47:11.264 --> 47:13.175
Oh, thanks for the wine.

47:13.833 --> 47:16.074
I don't drink,

47:16.135 --> 47:17.739
but thanks, anyway.

47:47.066 --> 47:48.306
Hello.

47:48.534 --> 47:50.013
Oh, hello!

47:52.672 --> 47:54.515
You look like
you could use a friend,

47:54.574 --> 47:56.576
to show you around Morocco
while you're here.

47:56.642 --> 47:59.384
Oh, I'm only gonna be here
for one night.

47:59.445 --> 48:02.255
Well, in that case, you look
like you could use a friend

48:02.315 --> 48:04.352
to show you around
for one night.

48:08.020 --> 48:10.728
You don't know
where she went from Pacoima?

48:10.790 --> 48:12.098
Well, tell her
when you see her

48:12.158 --> 48:14.968
that I gotta talk to her
right away. It's urgent.

48:15.194 --> 48:16.696
Okay, thank you.

48:17.997 --> 48:19.840
Still can't locate
your travel agent?

48:19.899 --> 48:21.742
I must've made
a dozen phone calls.

48:21.801 --> 48:23.371
Perhaps you'll have
better luck in the morning.

48:23.436 --> 48:25.780
I sure hope so. I wanna see
a little bit of London.

48:25.838 --> 48:27.249
Well, if you don't need
anything else,

48:27.306 --> 48:29.013
I believe
I'll turn in, sir.

48:29.075 --> 48:31.316
Wait. I think
I'll hit the sack, too.

48:36.516 --> 48:38.257
Is your room
satisfactory?

48:38.317 --> 48:40.194
Great.
Oh, good.

48:40.987 --> 48:42.398
No, I only wondered

48:42.455 --> 48:45.368
because, well,
it has quite a history.

48:45.424 --> 48:47.836
It does?
Oh, yes.

48:47.894 --> 48:49.396
Yes, indeed.

48:49.962 --> 48:52.533
Lord Bartholomew
slept there.

48:52.598 --> 48:54.236
A lord actually
slept in that room?

48:54.300 --> 48:56.041
Mmm, for most of his life.

48:56.102 --> 48:57.445
No kidding.

48:59.572 --> 49:02.849
Until he was
murdered in his bed.

49:05.044 --> 49:06.717
In this room?

49:06.779 --> 49:10.056
Mmm. Some say his soul
is still trapped in there,

49:10.116 --> 49:13.563
waiting to take revenge
on the men who murdered him.

49:18.357 --> 49:20.530
Well, good night.

49:20.960 --> 49:22.337
Night.

49:24.130 --> 49:26.542
The revenge part
is just legend.

49:27.533 --> 49:29.479
I wouldn't let it frighten me.

49:30.937 --> 49:33.975
Me? Frightened?
You gotta be kidding.

49:36.108 --> 49:38.054
Well, good night, then.

49:41.380 --> 49:42.916
Good night.

49:59.498 --> 50:01.239
Somebody moving out?

50:01.300 --> 50:04.645
No. Somebody's
decided to stay.

50:04.704 --> 50:08.151
I found some instant coffee, if
you feel like taking a chance.

50:08.207 --> 50:09.652
Why not?

50:11.344 --> 50:12.755
You like it?

50:13.346 --> 50:15.587
Well, actually,
it's pretty terrible.

50:16.849 --> 50:18.260
Oh, no!

50:18.985 --> 50:21.556
I thought you meant
the coffee. No.

50:21.621 --> 50:22.861
The painting is wonderful.

50:22.922 --> 50:25.061
You should never ask me a question
before 10:00 in the morning.

50:25.124 --> 50:26.194
I love the painting.

50:26.258 --> 50:27.635
You don't have
to go overboard.

50:27.693 --> 50:28.933
It's one of the first
I ever did.

50:28.995 --> 50:30.497
No, really, it's very nice.

50:30.563 --> 50:32.236
Oh, you're
a terrible liar.

50:33.599 --> 50:35.135
How about some breakfast?

50:35.201 --> 50:37.306
I know a terrific little
place down the road, mmm?

50:37.370 --> 50:38.678
Sure.
Okay.

50:38.738 --> 50:39.876
Give me a minute to change.

50:39.939 --> 50:41.145
Is there some place
I can wash up?

50:41.207 --> 50:43.118
Yes, of course.

50:45.077 --> 50:47.523
After breakfast,
I was gonna stop by

50:47.613 --> 50:49.559
Geoff's office.
Geoff's office?

50:51.217 --> 50:52.992
I thought you might.

50:53.285 --> 50:54.764
Thank you.

50:54.820 --> 50:56.822
I want to come
with you, Thomas.

50:57.556 --> 50:59.729
I'm not so sure
that's such a good idea.

50:59.792 --> 51:01.271
Whoever is after...

51:01.327 --> 51:03.933
Whatever we're after
certainly isn't playing games.

51:03.996 --> 51:06.272
Now I have the background
and the training

51:06.332 --> 51:08.471
and the experience
to deal with them.

51:08.534 --> 51:10.309
But I have the key.

51:32.258 --> 51:34.636
<i>Since I had been acting and
thinking like Geoff up to now,</i>

51:34.694 --> 51:36.332
<i>I wasn't
particularly surprised</i>

51:36.395 --> 51:39.672
<i>that St. Clair Press looked
exactly like I thought it would.</i>

51:40.299 --> 51:42.040
<i>I felt like I'd come home.</i>

51:46.372 --> 51:48.181
He made
some good investments

51:48.240 --> 51:50.618
to subsidize a business
he loved.

51:53.112 --> 51:54.386
Thomas!

51:54.447 --> 51:56.791
Is there any other way
out of here?

51:56.849 --> 51:59.659
Why would anyone
want to do this?

51:59.819 --> 52:02.561
Obviously they were looking
for something.

52:05.925 --> 52:07.268
His collection.

52:08.561 --> 52:11.440
Oh, it's everything
he loved.

52:11.497 --> 52:12.942
His books?

52:17.670 --> 52:19.581
His special books.

52:20.906 --> 52:23.819
If you were Geoffrey, where
would you hide something?

52:26.879 --> 52:28.517
His books.

52:36.622 --> 52:39.262
Thomas!
What?

52:41.060 --> 52:43.666
<i>âPain tings of
Constantin Brancusi. "</i>

52:43.729 --> 52:45.140
What about it?

52:46.665 --> 52:48.702
Brancusi wasn't a painter.

52:50.402 --> 52:52.075
He was a sculptor.

52:52.371 --> 52:53.782
Let me see that.

53:11.490 --> 53:12.798
Penelope.

53:19.832 --> 53:22.039
He was at the funeral.
You know him?

53:22.368 --> 53:23.711
No.

53:31.243 --> 53:32.654
What do you think
it means?

53:32.711 --> 53:35.317
I don't know.
Let's ask Inspector Stokesay.

53:42.888 --> 53:44.196
Hey!

53:45.224 --> 53:48.228
Thomas! He's the man
in the photograph!

54:07.246 --> 54:08.384
Stay here!

55:07.339 --> 55:08.511
Thomas!

55:27.026 --> 55:28.232
Thanks.

55:28.294 --> 55:31.537
The little boy in your dream, led you
directly in front of the Jaguar?

55:31.597 --> 55:34.976
Yes, and stood there
smiling.

55:36.135 --> 55:38.012
What do you suppose
it means?

55:38.070 --> 55:39.481
I don't know.

55:39.538 --> 55:41.347
I thought that...

55:42.241 --> 55:43.447
Yes?

55:44.143 --> 55:46.555
Well, you know how
some people think

55:46.612 --> 55:49.786
that dreams can be
kind of symbolic.

55:50.382 --> 55:52.419
Well, I thought maybe
the little boy was Geoff

55:52.484 --> 55:54.930
trying to lead me
to whoever killed him.

55:56.255 --> 55:58.030
Or into jeopardy.

55:58.090 --> 55:59.501
Why?

56:01.794 --> 56:03.501
Because of us?

56:05.130 --> 56:06.404
No.

56:06.532 --> 56:08.978
That would be... That's...

56:09.802 --> 56:12.578
I just don't believe
in ghost stories.

56:13.739 --> 56:15.650
Maybe you should...

56:16.608 --> 56:18.212
Maybe you should go away.

56:18.277 --> 56:19.779
What good would that do?

56:19.845 --> 56:21.950
Stop looking for these men.

56:23.582 --> 56:25.823
It might put you
out of danger.

56:27.920 --> 56:30.457
I don't think they're going to
let me disappear that easily.

56:30.522 --> 56:34.402
And even if they would, I'm not gonna
walk away and leave you with this.

56:35.661 --> 56:37.766
It really isn't
your problem.

56:37.830 --> 56:39.537
Yes, it is.

56:43.302 --> 56:44.747
Thomas.

56:44.803 --> 56:46.146
It's all right.

56:46.405 --> 56:48.817
We just have to get that
photograph to Inspector Stokesay.

56:48.874 --> 56:51.582
Maybe he already knows
who our friends are.

56:52.978 --> 56:54.286
Okay?

57:17.870 --> 57:19.247
Morning.

57:22.241 --> 57:24.949
Breakfast will be served
by the pool.

57:32.885 --> 57:35.126
Breakfast by the pool?

57:39.925 --> 57:41.336
Ta-da!

57:43.495 --> 57:45.270
I'm still dreaming, right?

57:45.864 --> 57:47.844
Good morning.
How did you sleep?

57:47.900 --> 57:49.277
Great!

57:50.202 --> 57:51.738
What time is it?

57:52.271 --> 57:53.341
Half past one.

57:53.405 --> 57:55.851
Oh, you gotta be kidding.
I never sleep that late.

57:55.908 --> 57:58.479
It's a common malady.
It's called jet lag.

58:00.412 --> 58:02.824
Please sit down.
Thank you.

58:02.948 --> 58:04.450
You know,

58:04.516 --> 58:08.157
I think it's called
dancing the night away.

58:12.057 --> 58:14.401
Do you get lonely
being here all alone?

58:15.928 --> 58:18.135
No. Tea?

58:22.034 --> 58:23.570
I---

58:24.436 --> 58:26.211
About last night...

58:30.476 --> 58:33.013
Well, it's just something
I'll never forget.

58:34.480 --> 58:36.756
So you like our city?

58:36.949 --> 58:38.587
I like the people.

58:39.251 --> 58:40.730
You know, there's no
overwhelming reason

58:40.786 --> 58:43.130
why I have to go
to England.

58:43.655 --> 58:45.657
I think you'd like it.

58:45.724 --> 58:47.897
I went to boarding school
there when I was a child.

58:47.960 --> 58:49.940
I spent my summers here.

58:49.995 --> 58:52.601
I like to go back there
at least once a year.

58:54.133 --> 58:56.044
Is this
your family's house?

58:57.302 --> 58:58.838
Oh, no. My family
went through their money

58:58.904 --> 59:01.077
long before I was
old enough to leave home.

59:01.140 --> 59:02.778
I bought this house.

59:02.841 --> 59:04.252
Do you like it?

59:04.643 --> 59:06.987
You gotta be kidding!

59:07.046 --> 59:09.526
I mean, but, how do you...

59:10.682 --> 59:12.423
What time is your flight
to London?

59:12.484 --> 59:14.088
Oh, I don't know.

59:14.186 --> 59:17.258
I've been having trouble
getting a flight out of here.

59:17.856 --> 59:20.097
Maybe I can
help you with that.

59:20.325 --> 59:22.362
When you travel as
much as I do,

59:22.428 --> 59:24.908
you get to know the people
on the airlines.

59:24.963 --> 59:28.809
There's no reason why you couldn't
pack a bag and come along with me.

59:28.867 --> 59:30.210
Is there?

59:32.271 --> 59:33.477
Look...

59:33.539 --> 59:35.485
I don't want you to think

59:36.809 --> 59:40.723
that last night was anything
more than last night.

59:45.317 --> 59:46.625
Excuse me.

59:49.121 --> 59:51.931
<i>We will all look back
on this time with fond memories</i>

59:51.990 --> 59:55.699
<i>and the knowledge we were indeed
part of something special.</i>

59:55.761 --> 59:58.640
It will require
hard work, dedication,

59:58.697 --> 01:00:02.611
concentration and,
above all, discipline.

01:00:03.335 --> 01:00:05.406
However,
with the proper spirit,

01:00:05.471 --> 01:00:09.317
I'm quite certain that we can have
Robin's Keep in excellent shape

01:00:09.374 --> 01:00:11.854
in time for
the gala housewarming.

01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:14.117
Mr. Mackerras will be giving
you a tour of the grounds,

01:00:14.179 --> 01:00:17.092
after which we will go over
menus and schedules.

01:00:17.883 --> 01:00:19.590
Are there any questions?

01:00:22.187 --> 01:00:24.030
Mrs. Ridley, is it?

01:00:24.623 --> 01:00:26.000
What about the ghost?

01:00:28.494 --> 01:00:30.974
I beg your pardon?
The ghost.

01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:33.967
We'd heard that this castle
was haunted.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.537
I cannot work anywhere

01:00:36.602 --> 01:00:39.276
where we have
ghosts floating about.

01:00:39.905 --> 01:00:42.112
I don't know what
you heard,

01:00:42.174 --> 01:00:44.450
but you can rest assured
there are no ghosts

01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:47.047
- here at Robin's Keep.
- Higgins!

01:00:47.412 --> 01:00:48.755
Higgins, it's in my room!

01:00:48.814 --> 01:00:50.487
The ghost is in my bedroom!

01:00:50.549 --> 01:00:51.857
'Quit!

01:00:51.917 --> 01:00:55.228
So do I. What're you waiting for?
Do something about it.

01:01:04.830 --> 01:01:06.537
You'd better not go
any closer.

01:01:08.734 --> 01:01:10.111
There it is, Higgins.
Did you hear it?

01:01:10.169 --> 01:01:11.239
I heard it.

01:01:11.303 --> 01:01:14.284
There definitely is something
in the room, all right.

01:01:29.087 --> 01:01:32.125
Within 48 hours, over 200
very rich, very powerful

01:01:32.191 --> 01:01:33.795
and very visible people
will arrive,

01:01:33.859 --> 01:01:37.568
expecting not only the most sophisticated
security to insure their safety,

01:01:37.629 --> 01:01:40.337
but also the very finest
entertainment arrangements.

01:01:40.399 --> 01:01:42.436
It has taken a
Herculean effort on my part

01:01:42.501 --> 01:01:44.037
to assemble what could
only be considered

01:01:44.102 --> 01:01:45.706
the most rudimentary staff

01:01:45.771 --> 01:01:48.149
and now, thanks
to your astonishing behavior,

01:01:48.207 --> 01:01:49.845
they have all quit!

01:01:50.409 --> 01:01:52.446
Gee, Higgins, I'm sorry.

01:01:52.844 --> 01:01:54.152
Anybody can make a mistake.

01:01:54.213 --> 01:01:56.284
Not when we're on deadline!

01:01:56.348 --> 01:01:58.419
I haven't left you,
Mr. Higgins.

01:02:08.093 --> 01:02:10.801
- Hi, this is Thomas Magnum.
- Ah, Mr. Magnum.

01:02:10.862 --> 01:02:13.604
I think I found something
in the St. Clair case.

01:02:13.665 --> 01:02:16.009
<i>You have?
And I think it's important.</i>

01:02:16.235 --> 01:02:19.512
Somebody turned Geoff's office
upside down looking for it.

01:02:19.571 --> 01:02:20.572
<i>Indeed.</i>

01:02:20.639 --> 01:02:23.779
And the man in the black Jaguar
has been snooping around.

01:02:24.576 --> 01:02:27.182
What exactly have you found?

01:02:27.279 --> 01:02:29.725
It's a photograph.
Three men, a code name...

01:02:29.781 --> 01:02:31.954
I'll bring it by so
you can see it for yourself.

01:02:32.017 --> 01:02:34.019
<i>No, no. There's no need to come
all the way into the Yard.</i>

01:02:34.086 --> 01:02:35.622
I'd be happy to pick it up.

01:02:35.687 --> 01:02:37.257
No, it's okay,
I'm not far away.

01:02:37.322 --> 01:02:39.427
No, no, I insist.
Where are you?

01:02:43.562 --> 01:02:46.406
Well, to tell you the truth, I think
it'd be easier if I found you.

01:02:46.465 --> 01:02:47.944
I'll be there
in about five minutes.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.411
<i>No, wait, don't...</i>

01:02:51.069 --> 01:02:52.070
Sorry.

01:02:54.506 --> 01:02:57.715
<i>I was about to discover
that red tape and bureaucracy</i>

01:02:57.776 --> 01:03:00.552
<i>have no allegiance
or geographic boundaries.</i>

01:03:01.013 --> 01:03:04.620
<i>Although Inspector Stokesay seemed
very concerned about the photograph,</i>

01:03:04.683 --> 01:03:08.062
<i>getting past his legions of clerks
and aides was no easy task.</i>

01:03:08.587 --> 01:03:10.999
Sorry to have
kept you waiting for so long.

01:03:11.056 --> 01:03:13.229
Please. Sit down.

01:03:19.698 --> 01:03:21.041
Well, Mrs. St. Clair.

01:03:21.099 --> 01:03:23.170
I know this won't make up
for the terrible loss,

01:03:23.235 --> 01:03:25.943
but I'm sure you'll be pleased to
know that we have someone in custody

01:03:26.004 --> 01:03:29.178
in the hit and run accident
involving your husband.

01:03:29.241 --> 01:03:33.314
He has confessed, and I think we'll
be able to successfully prosecute

01:03:33.378 --> 01:03:35.619
under involuntary
manslaughter.

01:03:36.014 --> 01:03:38.051
Involuntary?
Exactly.

01:03:38.116 --> 01:03:39.959
It was, after all,
an accident.

01:03:40.018 --> 01:03:42.191
Excuse me, but we've been
dealing with Inspector Stokesay

01:03:42.254 --> 01:03:45.201
and he's investigating this
as a murder.

01:03:45.424 --> 01:03:47.131
I beg your pardon?

01:03:47.392 --> 01:03:49.770
We came here specifically
to see Inspector Stokesay,

01:03:49.828 --> 01:03:51.307
and we've been waiting
for over an hour.

01:03:51.363 --> 01:03:53.570
Well, I apologize
for the delay, but...

01:03:53.632 --> 01:03:55.873
Well, if you don't mind,
we'd like to talk to him.

01:03:55.934 --> 01:03:57.436
Yes, please.

01:03:58.670 --> 01:04:02.345
But I am Inspector Stokesay.

01:04:11.116 --> 01:04:14.791
Do you have any idea why he might
be impersonating a Scotland Yard detective?

01:04:14.853 --> 01:04:16.161
We know
he was after something.

01:04:16.221 --> 01:04:19.202
Something, obviously, he was
afraid we might turn over to you.

01:04:19.257 --> 01:04:20.827
Do you know what that might be?
No.

01:04:20.892 --> 01:04:24.669
Well, we found this photograph
in Geoffrey's office.

01:04:24.729 --> 01:04:27.505
Now that must be important. He went
to a lot of trouble to hide it.

01:04:27.565 --> 01:04:29.476
Excellent! Excellent!

01:04:30.568 --> 01:04:32.047
Who are they?

01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:33.972
We don't know.

01:04:34.606 --> 01:04:35.914
We were hoping you would.

01:04:35.974 --> 01:04:38.648
Does the name Scorpio 6
mean anything to you?

01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:40.155
I can't say that it does, no.

01:04:40.211 --> 01:04:41.690
I can tell you
what I can do, though.

01:04:41.746 --> 01:04:43.817
I can run the name and the
face through the computers,

01:04:43.882 --> 01:04:45.793
see what the boys there
turn up.

01:04:45.850 --> 01:04:47.625
Well, what do you think?

01:04:48.486 --> 01:04:49.863
That's him.

01:04:49.921 --> 01:04:51.662
It looks exactly like him.

01:04:53.291 --> 01:04:55.293
This is fantastic!

01:04:56.895 --> 01:04:58.670
A perfectly ordinary
hit and run case

01:04:58.730 --> 01:05:01.768
turns into, potentially
anyway, the sort of case...

01:05:02.901 --> 01:05:04.642
Oh, I do beg your pardon.

01:05:04.803 --> 01:05:07.010
Absolutely no excuse at all
for such rudeness.

01:05:07.071 --> 01:05:10.985
It's purely that the implications
in this case are staggering!

01:05:11.709 --> 01:05:13.814
I hope I didn't offend you.

01:05:13.878 --> 01:05:16.825
I just find it hard to believe
it was an accident.

01:05:17.549 --> 01:05:20.860
I mean, don't you think it's
an extraordinary coincidence

01:05:20.919 --> 01:05:23.297
that Geoff should be hit
by a black Jaguar,

01:05:23.354 --> 01:05:28.099
and then a black Jaguar is
pursuing us all over London?

01:05:28.159 --> 01:05:31.606
The car involved in your husband's
accident was a black Daimler.

01:05:34.532 --> 01:05:36.136
But it was a black Jaguar
in my dream.

01:05:36.201 --> 01:05:38.044
Maybe not, Thomas.

01:05:38.369 --> 01:05:40.508
You thought it was a Jaguar.

01:05:41.039 --> 01:05:44.953
It's the same body, but a different make.
They look exactly alike.

01:05:46.211 --> 01:05:47.781
And I told Stokesay,

01:05:47.846 --> 01:05:51.123
that Stokesay,
that it was a Jaguar.

01:05:51.182 --> 01:05:53.719
After which he
followed you around in one.

01:05:53.785 --> 01:05:56.391
The question
we have to ask is why.

01:05:56.454 --> 01:05:59.401
And what was your
husband's connection with him?

01:05:59.457 --> 01:06:01.494
And what's this guy after?

01:06:12.003 --> 01:06:13.710
I want you
to do me a favor.

01:06:13.771 --> 01:06:15.751
I have to check something
out, and while I do,

01:06:15.807 --> 01:06:18.720
I'd like you to come
stay at Robin's Keep.

01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:21.215
Why can't I
come with you?

01:06:21.279 --> 01:06:23.281
Well, I'm not sure
what I'm going to find

01:06:23.348 --> 01:06:25.828
and if it turns out to be dangerous,
I'd like to know you're safe.

01:06:25.884 --> 01:06:27.386
What could Geoffrey
be involved with

01:06:27.452 --> 01:06:29.398
that could
get dangerous?

01:06:31.155 --> 01:06:34.227
You know something about
Geoffrey you're not telling me.

01:06:34.325 --> 01:06:35.929
Look, my whole world
is upside down.

01:06:35.994 --> 01:06:37.667
If you know something...

01:06:37.729 --> 01:06:39.231
I'm not sure
of anything yet,

01:06:39.297 --> 01:06:41.243
but when I am,
I'll tell you.

01:06:41.299 --> 01:06:42.505
I promise.

01:07:07.558 --> 01:07:09.128
Calvin, Calvin.

01:07:10.061 --> 01:07:12.541
Ah, Theodore Calvin.
Here we are.

01:07:12.597 --> 01:07:15.771
I'm afraid it was all
a mistake in the paperwork.

01:07:15.833 --> 01:07:18.404
Somehow, Tawny's Travel Agency
in Jersey City

01:07:18.469 --> 01:07:21.416
canceled a Calvinist
church group,

01:07:21.472 --> 01:07:25.579
and the computer deleted all
reservations with the name Calvin.

01:07:25.643 --> 01:07:28.123
We're terribly
sorry about the mix up.

01:07:28.913 --> 01:07:30.358
Your travel agent
created quite a stir

01:07:30.415 --> 01:07:32.452
when she heard
what happened.

01:07:32.517 --> 01:07:34.554
Well, as long as
it's been taken care of.

01:07:34.619 --> 01:07:36.895
We've upgraded you
to first class.

01:07:36.955 --> 01:07:39.026
Your flight
leaves in one hour.

01:07:39.090 --> 01:07:42.401
You'll be leaving, gate number nine.
Have a nice trip.

01:07:43.227 --> 01:07:45.104
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot.

01:07:45.163 --> 01:07:46.540
Thank you.

01:07:58.843 --> 01:08:00.186
Hello, operator.

01:08:00.478 --> 01:08:02.958
I'd like to make
a person-to-person call

01:08:03.014 --> 01:08:06.655
to Rick Orville Wright at...

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:17.604
Sade!

01:08:28.906 --> 01:08:30.283
Sorry, operator.

01:08:30.341 --> 01:08:32.651
I have the number right here.

01:09:10.448 --> 01:09:13.986
Hey, that's great, T.C. I told
you Tammy'd come through.

01:09:14.118 --> 01:09:17.462
No, I can't.
I'm sorry, I just can't.

01:09:17.522 --> 01:09:18.626
Higgins won't let me
out of his sight.

01:09:18.689 --> 01:09:20.691
You're gonna have
to take a cab.

01:09:21.192 --> 01:09:24.696
I don't know. You take this freeway
M25 or something like that,

01:09:24.761 --> 01:09:27.072
then you go past this
old Roman villa.

01:09:27.131 --> 01:09:30.169
He can tell the cab driver
it's the Old Bailie estate.

01:09:30.301 --> 01:09:32.804
Tell the cab driver
it's the Old Bailie estate.

01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:34.577
Yeah. See you.

01:09:34.639 --> 01:09:36.050
Hey, T.C. got a flight?

01:09:36.107 --> 01:09:38.553
Yeah, he got a flight, but I'm
gonna be honest with you, Thomas.

01:09:38.609 --> 01:09:41.180
He's not gonna be too thrilled about
the deal you worked out with Higgins.

01:09:41.245 --> 01:09:42.349
What deal?

01:09:42.412 --> 01:09:45.484
Oh, come on. Don't act innocent
with me, Thomas. I know you.

01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:47.120
You just figured you had
better things to do... Rick...

01:09:47.185 --> 01:09:49.961
...so you'd con your two good old
buddies here into pulling K.P.

01:09:51.288 --> 01:09:52.666
You're the one who said
you wanted to come over.

01:09:52.723 --> 01:09:54.828
I just said it sounded
like a good idea.

01:09:54.892 --> 01:09:56.371
Well, I thought it was
a good idea, too,

01:09:56.427 --> 01:09:57.963
until I found out
about the work program

01:09:58.029 --> 01:10:00.134
that you and Higgins
concocted.

01:10:00.198 --> 01:10:01.836
I didn't concoct anything.

01:10:01.899 --> 01:10:03.537
And where is Higgins?

01:10:03.835 --> 01:10:05.542
Busy auditioning musicians.

01:10:05.603 --> 01:10:07.776
And until he gets back, you can
start peeling some potatoes.

01:10:07.839 --> 01:10:09.785
We've got about
50 more pounds to peel!

01:10:09.841 --> 01:10:11.252
I'll peel.

01:10:13.077 --> 01:10:15.023
Well, I mean,
it's a challenge.

01:10:37.068 --> 01:10:40.140
That was remarkable.

01:10:40.204 --> 01:10:42.206
Would you like
to hear Loch Lomond?

01:10:42.273 --> 01:10:44.310
I'm afraid we haven't
the time.

01:10:44.375 --> 01:10:45.479
Thank you.

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.751
Entertainment for the party?

01:10:52.984 --> 01:10:54.895
Honestly, Magnum,
I'm beginning to despair

01:10:54.952 --> 01:10:57.364
that we'll ever
be ready in time.

01:11:02.126 --> 01:11:04.970
What are you doing here? I thought you'd
still be working on the St. Clair case.

01:11:05.029 --> 01:11:07.009
I am. I wanted to talk
to you about something.

01:11:07.064 --> 01:11:09.635
Mr. Higgins! Mr. Higgins!

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:11.543
I don't suppose
you've seen Millicent...

01:11:11.602 --> 01:11:13.878
Miss Mumford recently,
have you?

01:11:13.938 --> 01:11:17.476
As a matter of fact I noticed her
leaving about an hour ago. Why?

01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:21.053
Oh, no reason, really.

01:11:22.647 --> 01:11:25.890
So, Higgins... Just a moment,
Magnum, let me get this down.

01:11:29.086 --> 01:11:30.724
I wonder,

01:11:30.922 --> 01:11:34.233
did you move the silver
service somewhere?

01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:43.778
You didn't leave Miss Mumford alone
in a room with Mr. Masters' silver?

01:11:44.936 --> 01:11:47.177
She offered to polish it.

01:11:47.238 --> 01:11:50.185
I have never known anyone with
your phenomenal lack of judgment.

01:11:50.241 --> 01:11:51.914
Higgins... How can you
possibly expect me

01:11:51.976 --> 01:11:54.354
to recommend that Mr. Masters...
Higgins!

01:11:55.179 --> 01:11:56.522
This is important.

01:11:56.581 --> 01:11:58.822
Can I talk to you
for just a minute?

01:12:01.752 --> 01:12:04.289
We have not
finished this discussion.

01:12:12.496 --> 01:12:15.306
For the life of me, I can't see what
potential Mr. Masters saw in Ian.

01:12:15.366 --> 01:12:16.504
Higgins, when you were...

01:12:16.567 --> 01:12:18.911
After all, the Empire was not built
on lollygagging and good intentions.

01:12:18.970 --> 01:12:21.507
It was built on a solid
foundation of self-sacrifice

01:12:21.572 --> 01:12:23.643
and an unwavering
commitment to...

01:12:26.210 --> 01:12:27.450
My God.

01:12:28.713 --> 01:12:30.420
I sound just like

01:12:32.617 --> 01:12:34.187
my father.

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:40.468
I always promised myself
that I would never...

01:12:41.993 --> 01:12:43.563
How is your father?

01:12:46.197 --> 01:12:47.232
Have you seen him?

01:12:47.298 --> 01:12:48.641
Well, no, I haven't
seen him yet.

01:12:48.699 --> 01:12:53.148
Higgins! How can you come all the way
to England and not see your father?

01:12:53.204 --> 01:12:55.912
Have you called him?
No, I haven't called him.

01:12:55.973 --> 01:12:57.782
Don't you want to see him?
Of course I want to see him.

01:12:57.842 --> 01:13:00.118
It's just that there's been
so much to do here.

01:13:00.177 --> 01:13:02.589
Stuff that Ian could do
if you'd let him.

01:13:02.647 --> 01:13:04.718
I mean, everything's not
gonna fall apart, you know,

01:13:04.782 --> 01:13:06.921
if you take the afternoon off
to see your family.

01:13:06.984 --> 01:13:09.260
How long's it been?
Five, seven years?

01:13:13.090 --> 01:13:14.398
Forty.

01:13:16.327 --> 01:13:17.465
What?

01:13:18.796 --> 01:13:21.800
Since the year I was
expelled from Sandhurst.

01:13:25.303 --> 01:13:29.183
I tried to explain to my father
that I was enlisting and why.

01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:31.377
He told me that if I did,

01:13:31.442 --> 01:13:33.581
I need never
enter his house again.

01:13:37.715 --> 01:13:39.956
I haven't seen
my family since.

01:13:41.085 --> 01:13:43.031
But you've seen your brothers,
at least.

01:13:43.087 --> 01:13:47.092
My illegitimate half-brothers, you mean?
Oh, yes, they've come to call.

01:13:47.158 --> 01:13:50.571
But the family has not
acknowledged me since that day.

01:13:51.662 --> 01:13:55.872
Of course, I have long since forgiven
my father his rash statements.

01:13:55.933 --> 01:13:59.881
Perhaps I even understand
why he felt the way he did.

01:13:59.937 --> 01:14:02.440
Unfortunately,
he's never been able

01:14:02.506 --> 01:14:05.817
to take the step to reconcile
the unhappiness between us.

01:14:05.976 --> 01:14:07.478
Have you?

01:14:11.415 --> 01:14:14.294
It's not that simple.
Maybe it is.

01:14:14.385 --> 01:14:16.331
Surely you didn't
ask to see me

01:14:16.387 --> 01:14:18.697
to discuss
my family situation.

01:14:19.090 --> 01:14:20.592
Well, no.

01:14:21.092 --> 01:14:24.164
I wanted to talk to you
about Geoffrey St. Clair.

01:14:24.261 --> 01:14:27.174
I just wondered
if during your days at MI6

01:14:27.231 --> 01:14:30.303
you ever came across
the name Scorpio 6?

01:14:30.634 --> 01:14:32.545
Does it mean
anything to you?

01:14:33.204 --> 01:14:36.242
Well, apart from its
astrological significance...

01:14:38.676 --> 01:14:40.417
There is something.

01:14:40.878 --> 01:14:42.824
Scorpio 6...

01:14:47.918 --> 01:14:49.920
No, I can't recall.

01:14:50.888 --> 01:14:53.391
Did you find
something on the murder?

01:14:53.457 --> 01:14:55.733
I think so.
A piece of puzzle.

01:15:01.332 --> 01:15:05.246
But I can't quite
put it together yet.

01:15:10.374 --> 01:15:12.376
I think it's a code name
for a group of people

01:15:12.443 --> 01:15:14.650
and I think I know who two of them are.
A man and a woman.

01:15:14.712 --> 01:15:16.817
You know them
from your dream?

01:15:18.416 --> 01:15:21.329
No, no. I met
the woman at the hotel.

01:15:21.385 --> 01:15:22.864
The Carlsboro.

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:25.423
That's right. I just can't
tell whether she's involved

01:15:25.489 --> 01:15:28.231
or her life's
in danger, too.

01:15:30.728 --> 01:15:32.674
If she is in danger...

01:15:32.730 --> 01:15:34.004
Unicorn.

01:15:34.198 --> 01:15:35.472
What?

01:15:35.699 --> 01:15:37.770
A wood unicorn.
At the hotel?

01:15:37.835 --> 01:15:40.873
No, no. In my dream
I saw a train and a unicorn.

01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:46.119
There is a carving
at Marylebone Station.

01:15:46.177 --> 01:15:48.214
Part of the old
watering trough.

01:15:50.548 --> 01:15:51.822
Thanks, Higgins.

01:15:51.882 --> 01:15:53.020
Shall I come with you?

01:15:53.083 --> 01:15:55.586
No, I think it's time
you saw your dad.

01:15:56.787 --> 01:15:58.164
But thanks.

01:16:19.009 --> 01:16:20.682
Mr. Higgins...
Ian,

01:16:21.579 --> 01:16:24.116
this is very difficult
for me to say, but...

01:16:24.181 --> 01:16:25.956
It's all right, sir.

01:16:26.584 --> 01:16:28.427
I know what you have to say.

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:31.490
You do?

01:16:31.555 --> 01:16:33.432
And I don't blame you.

01:16:34.058 --> 01:16:35.867
I've been a dunderhead.

01:16:40.097 --> 01:16:41.770
What is this?

01:16:41.832 --> 01:16:43.368
My resignation.

01:16:43.901 --> 01:16:46.177
It is the only
honorable thing to do.

01:16:51.041 --> 01:16:52.520
You know,
I've been trying to think

01:16:52.576 --> 01:16:54.419
who it is you remind me of.

01:16:54.745 --> 01:16:58.158
And it's just now
occurred to me.

01:16:58.716 --> 01:16:59.786
Sir?

01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:03.388
Someone I was very close to

01:17:03.454 --> 01:17:05.593
who, as a young man.

01:17:05.656 --> 01:17:07.795
Tried very hard to please.

01:17:08.359 --> 01:17:10.270
Sometimes too hard.

01:17:11.729 --> 01:17:14.232
Did you ever
attend military school?

01:17:14.965 --> 01:17:16.945
From the time I was six.

01:17:21.105 --> 01:17:23.745
In spite of an occasional
lapse in good judgment

01:17:23.807 --> 01:17:25.946
and a slight tendency
to indulge

01:17:26.010 --> 01:17:29.014
in whimsical reminiscences
about the castle,

01:17:29.079 --> 01:17:33.585
I believe you have all the makings
of a first-rate major-domo.

01:17:33.684 --> 01:17:37.461
Therefore I can't accept
your resignation.

01:17:40.357 --> 01:17:42.064
Now, if there's
nothing else to discuss,

01:17:42.126 --> 01:17:43.935
you have a quartet to hire.

01:17:44.728 --> 01:17:46.366
I?
Yes.

01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:48.967
Another important matter has come
up that I need to attend to.

01:17:49.033 --> 01:17:52.071
I'm going to leave the hiring
of the musicians to you.

01:17:52.269 --> 01:17:53.509
Yes, sir.

01:18:27.605 --> 01:18:29.516
<i>Higgins' Estate.</i>

01:18:31.275 --> 01:18:32.447
<i>Hello ?</i>

01:18:33.777 --> 01:18:34.983
<i>Hello ?</i>

01:18:53.764 --> 01:18:56.643
<i>Hello, Higgins.
All going well?</i>

01:18:56.700 --> 01:19:01.740
Oh, yes, Mr. Masters.
Everything's going quite nicely.

01:19:01.905 --> 01:19:03.179
Thank you.

01:19:47.851 --> 01:19:50.525
<i>1220 express
service to Edinburgh</i>

01:19:50.587 --> 01:19:53.227
<i>is now departing, track six.</i>

01:19:59.496 --> 01:20:01.942
Excuse me.
I'd like to talk to...

01:20:02.733 --> 01:20:04.110
I guess the owner.

01:20:04.168 --> 01:20:06.842
I'm the owner. Owner,
manager, chief bottle washer.

01:20:06.904 --> 01:20:08.349
What can I do for you?

01:20:08.405 --> 01:20:11.386
My name is Thomas Magnum.
I'm a private investigator.

01:20:11.442 --> 01:20:12.682
Thomas Magnum?

01:20:12.743 --> 01:20:13.949
Yes.

01:20:14.011 --> 01:20:16.514
We better go
someplace private to talk.

01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:19.390
I had a message for you
from Geoffrey St. Clair.

01:20:23.987 --> 01:20:26.490
I've known Geoffrey
since he was a little tyke.

01:20:26.557 --> 01:20:29.504
Hardly recognized him when
he came back after the war.

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:31.699
Anyway, last 10 or 12 years,

01:20:31.762 --> 01:20:36.211
every so often, maybe once a year,
maybe less, he'd show up at the stand.

01:20:36.266 --> 01:20:38.212
He had a letter
all sealed up in an envelope

01:20:38.268 --> 01:20:40.407
addressed to Thomas Magnum.

01:20:40.471 --> 01:20:42.917
He said if any harm came to
him, I was to mail it to you.

01:20:42.973 --> 01:20:44.646
He said
it was his insurance.

01:20:44.708 --> 01:20:48.417
And you were the only person in the
world who'd know what to do with it.

01:20:49.046 --> 01:20:51.890
Well, I'd appreciate it
if you'd give it to me.

01:20:51.949 --> 01:20:54.293
If he came to any harm,
he said.

01:20:54.384 --> 01:20:56.386
I read about his accident
in the paper.

01:20:56.453 --> 01:20:59.525
I mailed the letter
to Hawaii yesterday.

01:21:04.795 --> 01:21:07.002
Pieces of the <i>puzzle</i>
were coming together,

01:21:07.064 --> 01:21:11.410
<i>and it was revealing a picture of
Geoffrey I hadn't wanted to look at</i>

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:24.889
<i>He gave you the key?</i>

01:21:31.088 --> 01:21:32.533
<i>I would say
that almost anything</i>

01:21:32.589 --> 01:21:34.899
<i>had something
to do with his death.</i>

01:21:37.194 --> 01:21:38.764
<i>The danger I had felt
was real.</i>

01:21:38.829 --> 01:21:40.672
<i>Geoffrey knew what it was</i>

01:21:40.731 --> 01:21:42.404
<i>and I was afraid I did, too.</i>

01:21:42.466 --> 01:21:44.377
<i>I knew I had to
talk to Penelope.</i>

01:21:44.434 --> 01:21:46.710
<i>But I was thankful
for the long drive home,</i>

01:21:46.770 --> 01:21:49.512
<i>hoping that I would
find the words I had to say.</i>

01:21:50.207 --> 01:21:52.209
Were you ever stationed
with my husband Geoffrey?

01:21:52.276 --> 01:21:55.814
No, but I sure heard a lot about him.
He was legendary.

01:21:56.313 --> 01:21:57.417
What do you mean?

01:21:57.481 --> 01:21:59.654
Well, the way I heard it

01:21:59.716 --> 01:22:01.354
was that Geoff could
slip into a village,

01:22:01.418 --> 01:22:03.261
go behind enemy lines,

01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:06.790
and terminate the key
personnel just like that,

01:22:06.857 --> 01:22:08.234
and slip back out

01:22:08.292 --> 01:22:09.464
and never lose
one of his own men.

01:22:09.526 --> 01:22:11.267
Boy, he was gifted.

01:22:12.396 --> 01:22:13.602
Terminate?

01:22:13.664 --> 01:22:14.870
What?

01:22:17.034 --> 01:22:20.777
You mean...assassinate?

01:22:21.038 --> 01:22:22.449
Hi, guys.

01:22:25.475 --> 01:22:29.355
He was...an assassin?

01:22:31.281 --> 01:22:33.090
What are you talking about?

01:22:33.517 --> 01:22:36.726
I was telling her about Geoff,
how good he was.

01:22:41.658 --> 01:22:43.103
Thomas, I thought
she would've known.

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:45.902
It's all right.
I should've told her myself.

01:22:55.839 --> 01:22:58.012
You lied to me! I didn't.
I told you the truth.

01:22:58.075 --> 01:22:59.884
All right, well,
you withheld information

01:22:59.943 --> 01:23:03.288
and there's a certain point where
that is tantamount to lying.

01:23:03.347 --> 01:23:05.691
All that camaraderie
and male bonding.

01:23:05.749 --> 01:23:07.660
That was all true!

01:23:08.819 --> 01:23:10.492
And the murdering?

01:23:11.355 --> 01:23:13.062
It was a war,
for God's sake!

01:23:13.123 --> 01:23:15.467
You neglected to tell me
about that.

01:23:15.525 --> 01:23:18.631
Would it have made you feel better
if we'd dropped bombs from B-52's?

01:23:18.695 --> 01:23:21.301
I mean, from 50,000 feet we
couldn't have seen their faces.

01:23:21.365 --> 01:23:22.309
It would've made me
feel better

01:23:22.366 --> 01:23:24.039
if you'd told me the truth
from the beginning.

01:23:24.101 --> 01:23:26.012
Why am I trying
to justify this to you?

01:23:26.069 --> 01:23:27.514
It's a part of my life.

01:23:27.571 --> 01:23:30.211
A part that's over,
but I'm not ashamed of it.

01:23:38.415 --> 01:23:41.487
Look, I just couldn't see

01:23:41.551 --> 01:23:45.522
what good it would do to you to
find that out about Geoffrey now.

01:23:46.890 --> 01:23:49.871
And I thought it might be
hard for you to understand.

01:23:50.827 --> 01:23:51.999
It is.

01:23:53.597 --> 01:23:55.167
I'm sorry.

01:23:58.335 --> 01:24:01.111
Penelope, there's something
else I have to ask you,

01:24:01.171 --> 01:24:04.084
and it may be even harder
for you to understand.

01:24:05.275 --> 01:24:07.516
Those photos
that Geoffrey sent you,

01:24:07.611 --> 01:24:09.318
you know,
the ones that are missing,

01:24:09.379 --> 01:24:11.552
can you tell me
what they are again?

01:24:14.217 --> 01:24:15.719
Pyramids, Egypt-

01:24:15.786 --> 01:24:18.027
When? Can you remember when?

01:24:21.158 --> 01:24:23.968
'81. October '81.

01:24:25.696 --> 01:24:27.266
Sadat.

01:24:30.167 --> 01:24:31.407
Nicaragua.

01:24:32.169 --> 01:24:33.648
Somoza.

01:24:35.806 --> 01:24:37.149
India.

01:24:37.274 --> 01:24:40.346
You remember? I told you
before each mission...

01:24:40.410 --> 01:24:41.821
He took a picture.

01:24:44.381 --> 01:24:45.689
Oh, no.

01:24:47.918 --> 01:24:49.420
Geoff never got out.

01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:54.967
Magnum.

01:24:58.495 --> 01:25:01.169
<i>The London Dispatch,
March 13, 1962.</i>

01:25:01.231 --> 01:25:05.509
"Scorpio 6, a secret organization
of multinational businessmen,

01:25:05.569 --> 01:25:07.913
"assassination plot uncovered,"
etcetera, etcetera.

01:25:07.971 --> 01:25:10.008
I thought I remembered
something about this.

01:25:10.073 --> 01:25:13.020
A group of men who used
assassination as a business tool.

01:25:13.076 --> 01:25:14.521
If you can't deal
with one government,

01:25:14.578 --> 01:25:15.921
find a way to install another.

01:25:15.979 --> 01:25:18.118
Anyway, MI6 uncovered
their organization,

01:25:18.181 --> 01:25:19.683
and put most
of the leaders in jail.

01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:22.754
All except Duncan Scott, reputed
mastermind of the group.

01:25:22.819 --> 01:25:23.854
He got away.

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:25.627
It was rumored
he escaped to South America,

01:25:25.689 --> 01:25:28.533
and later died
in an airplane crash there.

01:25:29.693 --> 01:25:33.140
This must have something
to do with Geoffrey's letter.

01:25:34.064 --> 01:25:36.010
He's the man they hired.

01:25:46.076 --> 01:25:47.851
The Carlsboro Hotel.

01:27:10.427 --> 01:27:12.134
You must stop,
this is a private party!

01:27:12.195 --> 01:27:14.573
Out of the way,
out of the way.

01:27:15.232 --> 01:27:17.576
Police! Everybody stand
where they are!

01:27:23.573 --> 01:27:24.984
Oh, my God!

01:27:26.643 --> 01:27:28.145
Hi. Thomas Magnum.

01:27:34.351 --> 01:27:35.989
You're very good.

01:27:36.086 --> 01:27:38.123
You remind me of Geoffrey.

01:28:14.491 --> 01:28:16.596
I was hoping to see you.

01:28:17.294 --> 01:28:21.765
I didn't want
to just go away.

01:28:22.966 --> 01:28:25.674
Well, Higgins said
you'd decided to come home.

01:28:25.735 --> 01:28:27.271
Just to pack.

01:28:28.538 --> 01:28:30.745
I'm going to Paris.
To paint.

01:28:30.874 --> 01:28:32.717
To think things over.

01:28:39.216 --> 01:28:41.253
I don't know what to say.

01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:46.066
About the other night...

01:28:48.325 --> 01:28:53.070
Penelope, I just don't want
to be Geoffrey to you.

01:28:55.932 --> 01:28:58.173
I don't want you
to be, either.

01:29:01.938 --> 01:29:03.679
Can I help you with that?

01:29:08.712 --> 01:29:11.215
Well, I think this is
where you came in.

01:29:12.983 --> 01:29:14.121
Yeah.

01:29:20.090 --> 01:29:22.696
If you ever get
tired of Paris,

01:29:24.728 --> 01:29:27.766
I know a place where you can
paint incredible sunsets.

01:29:28.732 --> 01:29:30.177
Thank you.

01:29:32.636 --> 01:29:34.741
Thank you for everything.

01:30:05.302 --> 01:30:08.078
Nice party, Higgins.
Robin will be proud of you.

01:30:08.138 --> 01:30:09.344
And of Ian.

01:30:09.406 --> 01:30:11.044
Yeah, I know.

01:30:14.611 --> 01:30:16.420
Did you ever
reach your family?

01:30:16.479 --> 01:30:18.720
What? Oh, no.

01:30:19.349 --> 01:30:21.727
We appear to be
running low on wine.

01:30:21.785 --> 01:30:23.458
Excuse me, Magnum.

01:31:15.805 --> 01:31:17.614
This is an outrage!

01:31:17.741 --> 01:31:20.813
I demand to know who you are
and where you're taking me.

01:31:23.713 --> 01:31:24.919
Hi.

01:31:25.181 --> 01:31:27.525
Magnum? What is

01:31:30.019 --> 01:31:32.124
the meaning of this?

01:31:32.188 --> 01:31:35.067
I figured it was the only way
I could get you here.

01:31:36.593 --> 01:31:39.335
Magnum, I really can't.
Yes, you can.

01:31:41.131 --> 01:31:43.907
All you have to do
is take the first step.

01:32:46.062 --> 01:32:47.632
Jonathan,

01:32:51.067 --> 01:32:52.410
my son.

01:32:54.437 --> 01:32:55.973
You've come home.
