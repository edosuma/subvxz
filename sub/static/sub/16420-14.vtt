- Yeah yeah pick one!

07:52.542 --> 07:54.291

07:54.333 --> 07:58.917
I mean, this is

07:54.333 --> 07:58.917
a little awkward, but...

07:58.959 --> 08:01.625
I guess Jasper.

08:01.667 --> 08:03.250
- Yeah baby!

08:03.291 --> 08:05.417
A'chugga-chugga

08:03.291 --> 08:05.417
CHOOO CHEW ON THAT!

08:05.458 --> 08:07.458
- Oh, wait wait wait.

08:05.458 --> 08:07.458
Wait wait wait...

08:07.500 --> 08:09.750
This is...this is

08:07.500 --> 08:09.750
a classic mix-up heh...

08:09.792 --> 08:11.709
Ah, Noelle, I think

08:09.792 --> 08:11.709
you're confused.

08:11.750 --> 08:15.375
I'm Henry.

08:11.750 --> 08:15.375
That's Jasper.

08:15.417 --> 08:17.959
I'm...I'm this one.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.083
- I know.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.375
And you're very sweet but...

08:22.417 --> 08:23.875
Jasper, I'd love

08:22.417 --> 08:23.875
to go out with you

08:23.917 --> 08:25.125
on Saturday night.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.458
- What?!?

08:29.500 --> 08:31.417
- Yes! Hey Kale...

08:31.458 --> 08:32.667
you and me, Saturday night.

08:32.709 --> 08:35.667
Go buy a new shirt.

08:32.709 --> 08:35.667
- 'Kay-kay.

08:37.792 --> 08:39.750
- I...I don't,

08:37.792 --> 08:39.750
I don't mean to be...

08:39.792 --> 08:42.250
it's just...why him?

08:42.291 --> 08:45.875
- I dunno. I guess...

08:45.917 --> 08:48.125
I just like his smile.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.709
- Hey...

09:02.917 --> 09:05.709
What you doin'?

09:08.125 --> 09:09.667
- I don't wanna talk about it.

09:09.709 --> 09:12.667
- He's pouting because

09:09.709 --> 09:12.667
Noelle wanted to go out

09:12.709 --> 09:14.792
with the J-Train

09:12.709 --> 09:14.792
and not the H-Bomb.

09:14.834 --> 09:17.417
- I said I don't wanna

09:14.834 --> 09:17.417
talk about it,

09:17.458 --> 09:18.625
so let's not talk

09:17.458 --> 09:18.625
about it, all right?

09:18.667 --> 09:19.875
How 'bout that?

09:18.667 --> 09:19.875
Gahh...

09:22.291 --> 09:24.375
- Okay. Okay.

09:24.417 --> 09:25.792
So where'd Jasper

09:24.417 --> 09:25.792
take her for dinner?

09:25.834 --> 09:27.917
- Ulch! I don't know.

09:27.959 --> 09:29.458
- They went to some

09:27.959 --> 09:29.458
new restaurant

09:29.500 --> 09:30.750
called The Basement.

09:30.792 --> 09:31.834
- The Basement?

09:31.875 --> 09:33.083
- Where's that?

09:33.125 --> 09:34.625
- Noelle found it.

09:34.667 --> 09:36.542
She said it's supposed

09:34.667 --> 09:36.542
to have amazing seafood.

09:36.583 --> 09:39.125
- Ooo, wow, amazing seafood,

09:39.166 --> 09:41.458
I sure hope Jasper

09:39.166 --> 09:41.458
doesn't choke on a shrimp.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.333
- Hey, you know

09:43.375 --> 09:45.333
what'll cheer up

09:45.375 --> 09:47.750
a teenage pouty pants?

09:47.792 --> 09:50.458
Cleanin' the boss's bathroom.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.500
- I don't think that--

09:50.500 --> 09:52.500
- I'm serious.

09:57.417 --> 09:59.333
- Would you prefer

09:57.417 --> 09:59.333
this pink one?

10:00.583 --> 10:01.458
[ alarm rings ]

10:01.500 --> 10:03.000
- Uh-oh...

10:01.500 --> 10:03.000
- What's up?

10:03.041 --> 10:05.417
- Emergency. Looks like...

10:05.458 --> 10:06.834
it's a video from

10:05.458 --> 10:06.834
the Swellview police.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.542
- Captain Man, Kid Danger,

10:08.208 --> 10:10.542
listen.

10:10.583 --> 10:12.709
We just found a kid

10:10.583 --> 10:12.709
lying in this alley...

10:12.750 --> 10:16.458
and his teeth are all gone!

10:16.500 --> 10:18.041
But, uh, my partner and I

10:16.500 --> 10:18.041
need to go...

10:18.083 --> 10:19.583
'cuz we gotta take our wives

10:19.625 --> 10:21.959
to see that show, "Mamma Mia."

10:22.000 --> 10:23.375
So we're gonna leave

10:22.000 --> 10:23.375
the kid with no teeth

10:23.417 --> 10:26.250
here, lyin' in the alley.

10:26.291 --> 10:28.250
- What? Nooo nooo.

10:26.291 --> 10:28.250
What?

10:28.291 --> 10:30.709
- Bye.

10:30.750 --> 10:34.083
- Uh! Dahhhhh!

10:34.125 --> 10:36.041
Mamma Mia!

10:36.083 --> 10:37.375
Why do the Swellview cops

10:37.417 --> 10:38.583
always dump everything

10:37.417 --> 10:38.583
on me and Henry?

10:38.625 --> 10:39.375
That's not fair!

10:39.417 --> 10:40.875
- Oh let's just go.

10:40.917 --> 10:43.375
I mean, at least

10:40.917 --> 10:43.375
it's somethin' to do.

10:43.417 --> 10:44.875
- Fine, whatever.

10:44.917 --> 10:46.667
Charlotte,

10:44.917 --> 10:46.667
if you get bored here,

10:46.709 --> 10:48.875
there's a toilet

10:46.709 --> 10:48.875
up in my bathroom

10:48.917 --> 10:50.667
that could really

10:48.917 --> 10:50.667
use a good scrubbing.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.875
And now I don't have

10:53.000 --> 10:54.875
a pink toilet brush.

10:54.917 --> 10:56.792
Great...

11:15.250 --> 11:18.417
- Hey! Hey, over here.

11:22.959 --> 11:25.959
- Alright son, wake up.

11:22.959 --> 11:25.959
Come on. Hey. Hey.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.959
- Woah, woah, woah!

11:26.000 --> 11:28.959
- Hey. Hey. It's alright.

11:29.041 --> 11:31.125
- Can you get on your feet?

11:29.041 --> 11:31.125
There you go.

11:31.166 --> 11:32.542
I'm Captain Man.

11:32.583 --> 11:33.959
- You don't need

11:32.583 --> 11:33.959
to introduce yourself.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.000
- What's your name?

11:37.500 --> 11:39.000
- [ mumbles ]

11:40.083 --> 11:42.125
- [ mumbles ]

11:42.166 --> 11:43.875
- Son...what happened to you?

11:43.917 --> 11:48.250
- [ mumbling ]

11:50.959 --> 11:53.000
- Ahh...

11:53.041 --> 11:55.333
Okay, we're not gonna be

11:53.041 --> 11:55.333
able to understand this freak.

11:55.375 --> 11:56.792
- He has no teeth

11:56.834 --> 11:58.250
it's really hard to talk

11:56.834 --> 11:58.250
without teeth!

11:58.291 --> 11:59.875
- Yeah, you're probably right.

12:03.375 --> 12:05.834
Here hold this.

12:05.875 --> 12:08.917
- Gentlemen, ah,

12:05.875 --> 12:08.917
just a second fellas...

12:08.959 --> 12:11.792
- I noticed you're

12:08.959 --> 12:11.792
both old, so...

12:11.834 --> 12:14.125
by any chance do either of you

12:11.834 --> 12:14.125
have false teeth?

12:14.166 --> 12:15.792
- Ulch...

12:15.834 --> 12:17.375
- What? What?

12:15.834 --> 12:17.375
What'd I say?

12:17.417 --> 12:19.917
- Thinking that all old people

12:19.959 --> 12:23.375
have false teeth

12:19.959 --> 12:23.375
is a stereotype. Okay?

12:23.417 --> 12:25.333
And we don't like stereotypes.

12:25.375 --> 12:27.875
- Oh. But...

12:27.917 --> 12:31.208
do either of you

12:27.917 --> 12:31.208
wear false teeth?

12:31.250 --> 12:32.625
- Yes, we both do.

12:32.667 --> 12:34.834
- I see.

12:34.875 --> 12:36.500
Well, on my authority

12:34.875 --> 12:36.500
as Captain Man,

12:36.542 --> 12:39.083
I need to borrow

12:36.542 --> 12:39.083
your false teeth.

12:39.125 --> 12:40.750
- Okay.

12:44.542 --> 12:46.333
- Thanks.

12:44.542 --> 12:46.333
- Welcome.

12:48.291 --> 12:49.792
- Okay son, open your mouth

12:49.834 --> 12:52.208
and I'll try to...

12:49.834 --> 12:52.208
get these in there...

12:52.250 --> 12:55.000
Don't. Don't fight it.

12:55.041 --> 12:56.375
Just...there we go.

12:59.458 --> 13:00.834
- Alright.

13:00.875 --> 13:02.500
Now try to tell us your name.

13:02.542 --> 13:04.959
- I'm...I'm...Sebastian.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.959
- Sebastian!

13:05.000 --> 13:07.959
- Ohhh...Sebastian!

13:08.000 --> 13:09.333
- I thought he was

13:08.000 --> 13:09.333
saying Samantha!

13:09.375 --> 13:11.291
- That's--that's weird.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.125
- That's not even a boys name.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.125
- That's a girl's name.

13:13.166 --> 13:14.000
- Sebastian.

13:13.166 --> 13:14.000
- That's funny...

13:15.291 --> 13:17.500
- So what happened?

13:15.291 --> 13:17.500
- Yeah, what happened?

13:17.542 --> 13:20.709
- Well, uh...

13:17.542 --> 13:20.709
I met this girl...

13:20.750 --> 13:23.125
and she asked me out

13:20.750 --> 13:23.125
to dinner...

13:23.166 --> 13:25.333
but then she took me

13:23.166 --> 13:25.333
to this place called...

13:25.375 --> 13:27.041
The Basement.

13:27.083 --> 13:28.792
- The Basement?

13:28.834 --> 13:32.166
- Wait, wait, that's

13:28.834 --> 13:32.166
where Noelle took...

13:32.208 --> 13:33.959
took "you-know-who" to dinner!

13:34.041 --> 13:35.917
- Yeah! Noelle!

13:34.041 --> 13:35.917
That was the girl's name!

13:35.959 --> 13:37.583
- Son, do you

13:35.959 --> 13:37.583
remember anyone else

13:37.625 --> 13:39.458
from this, uh...

13:37.625 --> 13:39.458

13:39.500 --> 13:40.500
- No!

13:39.500 --> 13:40.500
- D'ah!

13:40.542 --> 13:41.542
-Wait, yeah!

Uh, there was a man...

13:43.583 --> 13:45.542

13:46.792 --> 13:48.792
- Drill Finger.

13:46.792 --> 13:48.792
- Oh my god.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.917

- Help us!

14:03.208 --> 14:04.959
- Shut up!

14:07.166 --> 14:10.375
- Noelle, why would you

14:07.166 --> 14:10.375
do this to me?

14:10.417 --> 14:11.583
- Because I want money,

14:11.625 --> 14:14.250
and 'cuz I don't care about you.

14:14.291 --> 14:16.917
- I appreciate your honesty.

14:19.083 --> 14:21.875
- Now, prepare to have

14:19.083 --> 14:21.875

14:46.000 --> 14:47.917
and pull out what's inside.

14:47.959 --> 14:49.375
- Okay.

14:58.041 --> 14:59.000
What is this?

14:59.041 --> 15:00.375
- My lip balm.

15:00.417 --> 15:01.750

15:01.792 --> 15:03.166
- Moisturize my lips.

15:03.208 --> 15:04.417
They're really chapped.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Here's the pipe.

15:17.041 --> 15:20.041
Those are elderlies.

15:20.083 --> 15:21.500
Elderlies with bad teeth.

15:26.750 --> 15:29.166
- And they want

15:26.750 --> 15:29.166
what you young people have.

15:29.208 --> 15:31.625
- You mean...a future?

15:31.667 --> 15:33.917
- Nooo.

15:33.959 --> 15:35.375
- They need teeth!

15:35.417 --> 15:40.667
- That's right...young, strong,

15:35.417 --> 15:40.667
healthy teeth.

15:40.709 --> 15:42.583
- And they're willing

See this? See the wad?

16:52.875 --> 16:54.500
was gonna happen?

16:54.542 --> 16:55.875
Kid, toss me that thing.

17:25.250 --> 17:28.041

17:25.250 --> 17:28.041

17:29.083 --> 17:30.917
- Go!

17:30.959 --> 17:33.583

17:30.959 --> 17:33.583

17:33.625 --> 17:35.333
- Stay right there

17:33.625 --> 17:35.333

17:35.375 --> 17:37.458
