03:14.594 --> 03:17.620
He say, "Good morning,"
and ask, "How is your hand?"

03:17.830 --> 03:21.288
It's-- It's better.

03:21.534 --> 03:22.728
What's left of it.

03:25.772 --> 03:27.205
Sorry.

03:27.473 --> 03:30.237
We would like to speak with you
if you feel well enough.

03:30.443 --> 03:32.570
Yeah, that's all right.

03:34.080 --> 03:37.174
- Coffee?
- No, thank you.

03:40.086 --> 03:43.453
Tell us about this place you mention,
in Slovakia.

03:44.757 --> 03:46.588
It's this... .

03:47.493 --> 03:49.358
It's some kind of factory...

03:49.929 --> 03:52.397
<i>... where these people,
these very rich people...</i>

03:52.599 --> 03:55.659
<i>... they pay to torture and kill kids.</i>

03:56.202 --> 03:57.897
<i>Mostly backpackers.</i>

04:00.640 --> 04:02.972
And they killed two of my friends.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.584
They take you from this hostel...

04:21.661 --> 04:24.289
<i>... and they bring you
to this factory and... .</i>

04:25.898 --> 04:28.662
<i>I went there looking for Josh.</i>

04:28.868 --> 04:33.305
He was one of my friends
and they took him there and... .

04:36.042 --> 04:37.873
<i>And they... .</i>

04:38.077 --> 04:39.044
<i>They killed him.</i>

04:42.715 --> 04:44.410
It was horrible.

04:56.195 --> 04:57.924
He ask how you survive.

05:02.435 --> 05:03.402
I... .

05:12.445 --> 05:14.345
I escaped.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.351
Who organize this place?

05:27.560 --> 05:32.930
I don't know.
It's some kind of hunting club. They... .

05:33.466 --> 05:36.526
They all have the same tattoo.

05:36.736 --> 05:37.828
<i>It's a dog.</i>

05:38.037 --> 05:39.561
<i>It's a bloodhound dog.</i>

05:54.320 --> 05:56.845
Strange that you mention this tattoo.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.249
Why?

06:07.900 --> 06:12.803
Because someone was found dead
in a train station bathroom in Vienna...

06:13.005 --> 06:15.405
...with this same bloodhound tattoo
you describe.

06:22.782 --> 06:26.912
Security tapes from this station
show him entering from a platform...

06:27.120 --> 06:31.250
...where a train arrive earlier that day
from Slovakia.

06:31.457 --> 06:33.948
It came through
the same station in Vienna.

06:38.464 --> 06:40.432
You were on that tape.

06:46.272 --> 06:50.072
Did his tattoo look something like this?

06:50.576 --> 06:52.203
What the fuck's going on?

06:52.412 --> 06:54.607
Help! Somebody help me!

07:07.360 --> 07:08.486
Jesus.

07:20.039 --> 07:21.597
You hungry?

07:22.074 --> 07:24.099
It's 3:15 in the morning.

07:24.310 --> 07:27.006
I have to take these with food.
I wanna know if you want anything.

07:27.246 --> 07:30.147
Yeah, I want you to talk to someone.

07:31.150 --> 07:33.243
When are you gonna tell
Josh's mother what happened?

07:33.453 --> 07:34.750
I'm not.

07:37.089 --> 07:38.920
She still thinks her son's in Europe.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.389
What the fuck
am I supposed to tell her?

07:41.594 --> 07:44.620
- She'll go straight to the police.
- Yeah, exactly. Someone should.

07:44.831 --> 07:48.961
No, no one should. You don't get it.
These people are tied into everyone.

07:49.168 --> 07:50.601
Somebody starts asking questions...

07:50.803 --> 07:52.668
...they're gonna come after me
and find me.

07:53.072 --> 07:56.906
At my grandmother's house? I've
been coming here since I was a kid.

07:57.109 --> 07:59.907
I can barely find the place.
I had to ask my sister for directions.

08:00.112 --> 08:02.137
- You told your sister we were here?
- Yeah. So?

08:02.348 --> 08:04.839
- Well, who else knows?
- No one!

08:05.051 --> 08:06.518
Jesus.

08:07.653 --> 08:10.144
I'm doing this for your protection too.
You know that, right?

08:10.356 --> 08:12.688
Oh, Paxton... .

08:15.027 --> 08:16.016
Look.

08:16.629 --> 08:19.029
I took you back because I felt bad.

08:19.565 --> 08:21.965
But you're going crazy.

08:22.168 --> 08:25.626
You wake up every night screaming,
and I can't sleep.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.430
Well, that won't
be a problem anymore.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.267
Paxton, that's not what l--

08:30.243 --> 08:32.609
Oh, fuck.

09:02.942 --> 09:04.603
Morning!

09:23.629 --> 09:25.460
Paxton?

09:34.640 --> 09:35.868
Hey.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.621
Lorna?

10:56.922 --> 10:58.480
Lorna?

11:00.793 --> 11:04.194
Sorry. I was trying to be
in the moment.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.365
Absorb.

11:11.737 --> 11:14.831
Do you think she ever saw a cock
before this class?

11:15.141 --> 11:17.336
If she did, it was in a Botticelli.

11:17.543 --> 11:18.805
Oh, my God.

11:19.011 --> 11:22.879
If I hear her talk about how emotional
the Botticelllis are one more time...

11:23.082 --> 11:25.846
...I swear to God,
I'm gonna choke the bitch to death.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.091
Until Tuesday.

11:36.295 --> 11:37.694
Are you all packed for Prague?

11:37.897 --> 11:40.297
- Jeans. No heels.
- Awesome.

11:40.499 --> 11:42.990
I can't do it on the cobblestone.
I don't know how you do it.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.295
I can teach you if you bring heels.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.175
Axelle.

12:00.820 --> 12:04.051
Hands on your pencils, boys.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.070
- Would he ever?
- Excuse me, girls.

12:21.273 --> 12:22.570
- Excuse me. Hi.
- Hi.

12:22.775 --> 12:25.471
- May I see?
- Oh, they're just rough.

12:25.678 --> 12:28.203
Show her. Don't be shy.

12:31.817 --> 12:33.114
That's the one of you.

12:33.352 --> 12:36.719
- Oh, wow, that's beautiful.
- Thanks.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.412
How much would you want for it?

12:38.624 --> 12:40.558
I wouldn't sell them.
You can have this one.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.250
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:42.461 --> 12:45.726
- Oh, my God, thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

12:45.931 --> 12:48.126
Can I buy you a drink or something?

12:48.334 --> 12:51.770
Oh, I'm actually late. We're
catching a train to Prague, but... .

12:51.971 --> 12:54.303
- I don't know. Maybe some other time.
- Okay.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.338
- Yeah! Okay.
- Okay.

12:56.542 --> 12:59.943
- I'll see you.
- All right. Bye. Thanks.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.619
No, Dad. It's Prague.
We're gonna be fine.

13:10.823 --> 13:12.688
It's not the Ukraine.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.594
No.

13:18.564 --> 13:20.896
No, Dad,
do not book the Four Seasons.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.533
Book it, bitch. Book it. Please!

13:22.735 --> 13:26.694
Because, Dad, no college students
are staying at the Four Seasons.

13:26.906 --> 13:31.502
And, you know, it's for old people.
So thank you, but please don't.

13:32.278 --> 13:33.643
What?

13:36.782 --> 13:39.182
Yeah. Yes, we have chaperones.

13:39.385 --> 13:41.216
Okay, love you. Bye.

13:41.687 --> 13:44.349
Jesus, I hate that he calls
every fucking five minutes.

13:44.557 --> 13:47.720
- All right, let's go.
- Hold on. We gotta wait for someone.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.658
Who?

13:52.765 --> 13:53.789
- Yeah.
- No.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.057
- Yeah.
- No.

13:55.267 --> 13:57.895
She cornered me in the apartment.
She's homesick, crying.

13:58.103 --> 13:59.730
I felt bad. What am I supposed to say?

13:59.939 --> 14:03.136
She's homesick for Baltimore?
We're in Rome, for fuck's sake.

14:03.342 --> 14:04.969
She's not that bad.

14:21.093 --> 14:23.186
Wow, is that a new journal
you got there?

14:24.063 --> 14:26.190
Yeah. It's a travel journal.

14:26.398 --> 14:27.922
For emotional callbacks.

14:28.901 --> 14:30.095
Of course.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.538
Lorna, we're gonna grab a drink.
You wanna go?

14:34.340 --> 14:35.705
I'm okay. Thank you.

14:36.609 --> 14:39.874
All right.
Well, we'll see you in a little bit. Okay.

14:41.447 --> 14:42.607
Knock yourself out, buddy.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.406
See you later.

14:56.328 --> 14:59.229
Excuse you. Asshole.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.571
She's like a 20-year-old grandmother.

15:12.778 --> 15:14.871
Whatever. She'll watch our stuff.
She's happy there.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.374
That's what she likes to do.

15:17.583 --> 15:18.982
Oh, we didn't order these.

15:19.184 --> 15:20.981
They're from girl.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.315
Whoa, your girlfriend's stalking us.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.622
Hey. What are you doing?

15:30.095 --> 15:32.256
You inspired me to take a trip.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.101
Watch this.

15:46.045 --> 15:48.036
You've got to be kidding me.

15:48.414 --> 15:49.676
Hello. What's your name?

15:57.723 --> 16:01.352
Do you know where we could score,
like, party favors?

16:01.994 --> 16:03.086
What do you need?

16:03.295 --> 16:06.458
I don't know.
Like, bud and ecstasy and, like... .

16:07.967 --> 16:09.298
PCP?

16:09.501 --> 16:11.799
Ice? Peyote? Crank?

16:12.004 --> 16:14.165
Okay, okay, bud and X are good.

16:16.575 --> 16:17.940
Sure.

16:19.011 --> 16:22.538
We go back to my car. I got some.

16:22.915 --> 16:24.143
Yeah?

16:25.484 --> 16:27.714
- Yeah?
- Okay.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.693
Fuck. You know what?

16:41.500 --> 16:45.231
I'm trying but I can't find them.
Just hang on, yeah?

16:50.175 --> 16:53.008
- You want drink?
- No, I'm fine.

17:03.155 --> 17:04.247
Hey, you know what?

17:04.455 --> 17:07.584
It's okay because we can just get
it at the club when we go to Prague.

17:07.792 --> 17:09.727
No, stay.

17:11.463 --> 17:13.988
I find them. Okay?

17:19.438 --> 17:21.429
You smell nice.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.337
- Whit, we gotta go. Lorna's waiting.
- Yeah, we have our friend.

17:26.545 --> 17:27.876
- You have friend?
- Yeah.

17:28.079 --> 17:31.413
<i>One, two, three, perfetto. Otherwise,
we have to take turns, huh?</i>

17:34.987 --> 17:36.750
You know, we're gonna go,
so never mind.

17:36.955 --> 17:41.255
Where you go? I knew you were
a tease, you fucking cunt.

17:41.460 --> 17:42.757
What the fuck did you call me?

17:42.961 --> 17:45.759
I called you
stupid fucking American cunt!

17:45.964 --> 17:47.124
- Fuck you!
- You know what?

17:47.332 --> 17:50.824
The train to fucking Prague
is long, you bitch.

17:51.036 --> 17:52.731
We'll come see you.

17:53.372 --> 17:54.805
Are you fucking insane?

17:55.007 --> 17:56.372
What? I fucking hate that word.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.907
"Oh, you stupid American cunt."
I fucking lost my temper.

17:59.111 --> 18:01.375
Okay, but it's not like
we're on campus and you can...

18:01.580 --> 18:04.174
...call the dean
and file a report or something.

18:09.188 --> 18:11.383
Oh, my God. Lorna, what happened?

18:11.824 --> 18:13.758
Some guy took my iPod.

18:13.959 --> 18:15.153
What?

18:15.360 --> 18:18.158
Is there, like, a police officer
on the train or something?

18:18.664 --> 18:20.859
- Yeah. I'll go check.
- Okay.

18:22.701 --> 18:23.963
It had everything.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.671
That's awful. I'm so sorry.

18:29.341 --> 18:31.036
I'm sorry.

18:35.080 --> 18:36.638
Here you go.

18:51.029 --> 18:52.587
It's those fucking guys.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.892
The fucking guys, the Italian guys
from the room down the hall.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.796
- What do we do?
- Just be quiet.

19:07.546 --> 19:08.570
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:08.780 --> 19:11.112
Excuse me.
Did one of you girls lose this?

19:11.450 --> 19:13.315
Oh, my God!

19:13.986 --> 19:15.749
How did you know this was mine?

19:15.954 --> 19:19.151
I saw some guy run out of your room.
He tried to take my bag.

19:19.558 --> 19:21.958
I fought him off
and this felled out of his pocket.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.894
I'm a little worried he might
come back looking for me.

19:25.097 --> 19:27.565
Well, do you wanna come in here
and hang out with us?

19:27.799 --> 19:29.630
- Really?
- Yeah, we have an extra seat.

19:29.835 --> 19:30.961
- Yeah, come in.
- Totally.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.330
Thank you.

19:35.307 --> 19:36.934
I think...

19:37.142 --> 19:39.007
...we all need a little of this.

19:39.978 --> 19:41.411
Oh, awesome.

19:42.814 --> 19:44.975
Oh, no, thanks. I don't drink.

19:45.517 --> 19:47.109
Thank you.

19:47.419 --> 19:49.819
As my father always says:

19:50.055 --> 19:52.250
<i>"Nazdrovia." To your health.</i>

20:05.704 --> 20:08.434
So are you going to Prague
for the football match?

20:08.640 --> 20:10.437
I kind of wanna go home.

20:10.642 --> 20:15.102
Oh, I don't blame you. I got
robbed twice on the overnight train.

20:15.314 --> 20:17.179
There are so few safe places
left in Europe.

20:17.816 --> 20:19.078
So where are you going?

20:20.185 --> 20:21.743
On a little spa vacation.

20:22.287 --> 20:23.254
Where?

20:23.789 --> 20:25.017
Slovakia.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.454
Wait, wasn't there, like,
some war in Slovakia?

20:28.560 --> 20:31.791
There hasn't been war in Slovakia
for 50 years.

20:31.997 --> 20:33.225
That's Bosnia, darling.

20:33.432 --> 20:35.730
- Oh, like you knew.
- I did so.

20:35.934 --> 20:37.458
What are the spas like there?

20:37.669 --> 20:41.298
They're the best natural hot springs
in the world.

20:41.506 --> 20:45.567
I go twice a year. It's great to get away
from the Italian guys.

20:45.777 --> 20:47.108
They get to be a bit much.

20:48.313 --> 20:50.304
Wow, hot springs?

20:50.515 --> 20:53.882
That sounds so therapeutic.
I wanna go.

20:54.086 --> 20:57.613
It's very easy. You just have to
switch trains in Prague.

20:58.790 --> 21:01.020
It could be nice.

21:01.326 --> 21:05.786
You know? I had enough gross guys
for one weekend.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.797
Okay, we'll go.

21:13.372 --> 21:14.964
Do you know of a good place to stay?

21:16.341 --> 21:21.335
- Smart move with the shoes.
- What? It's so easy. You have to try it.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.939
Hi. Can I help you?

21:52.144 --> 21:54.635
- I need a room for my friends, please.
- Yeah, cool.

21:54.846 --> 21:56.837
Your passports, please.

22:00.752 --> 22:02.845
American. Good.

22:03.055 --> 22:05.785
Yeah, cool. It's 10 Euros for night.

22:07.492 --> 22:09.050
No. I got this one.

22:09.261 --> 22:10.523
No. It's on me.

22:10.729 --> 22:12.993
- Thank you.
- Money.

22:13.365 --> 22:14.992
Thanks.

22:17.369 --> 22:18.734
Here are your keys.

22:20.305 --> 22:23.900
And this is a notice for
the harvest fair tonight, girls.

22:24.109 --> 22:26.942
Will be sexy good times. Come on.

22:27.145 --> 22:29.978
<i>It's Dožinky. I know that.
They have it every year.</i>

22:30.382 --> 22:33.874
- Yeah.
- Lots of music, dancing, costumes.

22:34.086 --> 22:36.145
Oh, my gosh! Could we go?

22:37.823 --> 22:40.314
- It sounds kind of gay.
- Excuse me.

22:46.665 --> 22:48.997
Oh, we are so going to
the harvest festival.

22:49.201 --> 22:52.534
- Come on. This way.
- Thank you.

22:53.105 --> 22:55.039
You're welcome.

22:57.943 --> 23:00.810
Do you think they have any frescoes
in the room?

23:22.601 --> 23:25.536
Wow, this room feels so timeless.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.637
Are you kidding right now?

23:30.842 --> 23:31.866
Oh, my God!

23:33.211 --> 23:34.974
Sexy.

23:36.314 --> 23:37.713
<i>Come here.</i>

25:48.380 --> 25:49.870
Yes! Yes!

25:50.215 --> 25:51.842
Yeah!

25:52.651 --> 25:54.278
That's what I'm talking about, huh?

26:16.875 --> 26:18.570
Todd, what's up?

26:19.945 --> 26:22.937
Yeah, nothing.
We're just finishing up breakfast.

26:25.483 --> 26:26.848
Really?

26:30.422 --> 26:32.322
Wow, I didn't think--

26:33.959 --> 26:36.359
Jesus. You sure?

26:37.462 --> 26:42.525
Yeah, yeah, okay. I can go right now.
I'll tell her I have to meet a client.

26:43.301 --> 26:44.893
Okay.

26:45.370 --> 26:46.997
See you.

26:56.247 --> 26:59.375
<i>No respect for me.
No respect for mother earth.</i>

26:59.584 --> 27:02.451
<i>Well, don't you have
anything to say for yourself?</i>

27:04.255 --> 27:06.723
<i>Well, that's just fine.
We can all ride home in silence.</i>

27:14.232 --> 27:17.963
Gosh! This village is so enchanting.

27:18.436 --> 27:20.802
Lorna, are you having a
"journal-gasm" right now?

27:21.006 --> 27:23.031
Actually, yes. Multiple ones.

27:23.241 --> 27:26.267
I get to write about
how beautiful this village is...

27:26.478 --> 27:28.969
...and I get to write about
what a raving bitch you are.

27:31.583 --> 27:33.551
She comes back swinging!

27:33.752 --> 27:36.448
- Well-played.
- Thank you.

27:39.724 --> 27:40.691
Dollar!

27:41.426 --> 27:42.484
Dollar!

27:42.927 --> 27:44.690
Do you guys have a dollar?

27:44.896 --> 27:47.296
- I got it.
- Oh, no, no, no.

27:47.499 --> 27:50.434
No, no, no. I got it. I got it.
Let me.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.974
I have Smints.

27:58.910 --> 28:00.639
Would you like a Smint?

28:13.224 --> 28:14.919
Bitches!

28:21.566 --> 28:23.693
Welcome to Slovakia.

28:31.743 --> 28:35.270
You both have corner suites
with views of the river.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.539
Here are your pagers.

28:37.749 --> 28:40.513
Perfect. Thank you.

28:42.687 --> 28:45.417
- You ready to do this?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

28:46.191 --> 28:47.590
Really?

28:47.792 --> 28:50.260
Because you look like
your dog just died.

28:50.462 --> 28:53.158
I'm just jet-lagged, man.
I'll take a shower and I'll feel better.

28:53.364 --> 28:55.594
- All right.
- Thanks.

28:59.404 --> 29:01.702
Oh, my God!

29:59.330 --> 30:00.695
Hey, guys!

30:01.166 --> 30:02.190
Yes?

30:02.667 --> 30:04.294
For the apartment.

30:04.602 --> 30:06.536
Awesome, dude.

30:06.738 --> 30:09.434
Those swords are like 1000 Euros.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.768
Trust me, she can afford it.

30:12.744 --> 30:15.645
Does she get, like,
a really big allowance?

30:15.947 --> 30:18.313
No, it's more like an inheritance.

30:19.350 --> 30:22.444
Her mom died when she was 12 and,
like, left her everything.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.519
And so she keeps her dad
on an allowance.

30:25.857 --> 30:27.449
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:28.626 --> 30:31.857
She could pretty much buy Slovakia
if she wanted to.

30:34.199 --> 30:36.759
Yeah. It's pretty rad.

31:03.828 --> 31:05.386
Yeah!

31:06.531 --> 31:08.396
Badass.

31:09.100 --> 31:11.660
Let me see this motherfucker.

31:16.741 --> 31:18.436
You're up, bro.

31:22.013 --> 31:24.948
I think I'm gonna pass on the tattoo.

31:25.183 --> 31:26.582
Come on, man, sit down.

31:26.784 --> 31:30.151
A tattoo's not really me.
It's not my style.

31:30.355 --> 31:34.155
I didn't know and I don't like needles.
I don't like needles very much.

31:34.359 --> 31:36.850
Dude, what are you doing? Sit down.

31:37.061 --> 31:39.962
Here's the problem. Linda. What
is she gonna say when she sees this?

31:40.164 --> 31:43.565
My wife is not gonna
really understand.

31:43.768 --> 31:46.236
Is there some other option?

31:47.005 --> 31:49.599
Everyone must get tattooed.
Part of contract.

31:49.974 --> 31:50.941
Yeah.

31:51.175 --> 31:52.369
Let's do it. Come on, man.

31:52.577 --> 31:54.602
Why don't you sit down?
These guys aren't playing.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.473
A tattoo is
a little difficult to explain, Todd.

31:57.682 --> 31:59.673
Didn't seem like you had
any problem explaining...

31:59.884 --> 32:02.216
...the gonorrhea you brought back
from Thailand.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.911
Can't believe you're bringing up
the gonorrhea. Every time--

32:05.924 --> 32:07.289
Is there any problem here?

32:07.492 --> 32:10.950
No, no. I just didn't know
that this was part of it.

32:14.565 --> 32:15.964
Stuart.

32:16.167 --> 32:20.968
This is not like going to a whorehouse.
You can't just back out.

32:26.844 --> 32:29.642
Get in the fucking chair.

32:36.321 --> 32:37.913
Yeah.

32:39.991 --> 32:42.585
Come on, man. Look at this.

32:43.027 --> 32:45.222
I'm fucking proud of mine.

33:02.280 --> 33:04.680
Look what I found!

33:05.216 --> 33:08.879
Okay, and before you say anything,
it's cider, it's non-alcoholic...

33:09.087 --> 33:11.248
...and those little kids right there
made it.

33:11.456 --> 33:13.117
- Oh, my gosh, really?
- Yeah.

33:13.324 --> 33:15.258
- I'm gonna go say thank you.
- Okay.

33:15.460 --> 33:17.860
They don't speak much English.

33:20.398 --> 33:24.767
This is quite possibly the most
alcoholic cider I've ever tasted.

33:25.069 --> 33:26.696
Come on, it's good for her.
She needs it.

33:26.904 --> 33:28.462
Thank you.

33:30.008 --> 33:30.975
Well, cheers.

33:36.414 --> 33:38.143
Oh, my God, my song! Let's go!

33:39.851 --> 33:41.045
Come!

33:45.757 --> 33:48.157
Come on, Borat.
Let's see what you got.

34:08.413 --> 34:09.937
There they are.

34:10.148 --> 34:11.274
Three o'clock.

34:11.783 --> 34:13.444
- Jesus.
- Right?

34:13.650 --> 34:15.880
It's fucking crazy, huh?
Dead ringer.

34:16.087 --> 34:18.487
Happy fucking birthday, bro.

34:22.126 --> 34:25.458
- Dude, where you going?
- In for a better look.

34:51.289 --> 34:52.255
Me?

35:33.764 --> 35:35.231
Hi.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.093
Hi.

35:37.335 --> 35:40.964
Would you like to dance with me?

35:42.507 --> 35:44.407
No, thank you. I'm--

35:44.609 --> 35:46.042
I'm not nearly drunk enough.

35:46.244 --> 35:47.734
Come on. I'll show you how.

35:47.945 --> 35:50.072
No, really. It's easy.

35:52.049 --> 35:56.349
No. Thank you, really, but my feet.
I'm tired.

35:59.423 --> 36:01.584
I could have helped you.

36:03.327 --> 36:05.124
Excuse me?

36:12.236 --> 36:13.203
Hey.

36:14.305 --> 36:15.533
Hey.

36:15.740 --> 36:18.368
That guy make you some troubles?

36:18.643 --> 36:21.043
No. He's fine.

36:22.747 --> 36:24.977
What he say to you?

36:26.484 --> 36:28.714
Nothing. He just wanted to dance.

36:30.588 --> 36:33.148
He won't bother you anymore.

36:34.091 --> 36:36.286
Oh, he wasn't bothering me.

36:40.431 --> 36:43.093
Here. Take a drink.

36:50.575 --> 36:53.772
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

37:00.518 --> 37:02.315
- Oh, I'm so sorry!
- Don't worry about it.

37:02.520 --> 37:04.488
I'm so, so sorry. I'm such an idiot.

37:04.689 --> 37:06.213
No, it's all right.

37:06.691 --> 37:09.387
- Here, let me get you a drink.
- No, you don't need to.

37:09.594 --> 37:10.925
- No, I insist.
- No, no.

37:11.128 --> 37:12.857
I insist.

37:21.939 --> 37:24.134
Beth! Beth!

37:24.342 --> 37:27.778
Beth! Oh, my God, Roman wants to
take me on a boat ride...

37:27.979 --> 37:29.913
...and he's just so suave
and he's amazing...

37:30.114 --> 37:32.844
...and he doesn't speak English,
but we understand each other.

37:33.050 --> 37:37.987
Yeah. Just promise me you won't
go on a boat ride with him, okay?

37:38.189 --> 37:39.486
Why not?

37:39.724 --> 37:41.555
What's the big deal?
You don't fancy him?

37:41.759 --> 37:45.354
Just because he's not "Whitney
approved" or "Beth approved" looking?

37:45.563 --> 37:48.862
No, I'm not saying that at all. I just
want you to stay here where it's safe...

37:49.066 --> 37:50.897
...we're all together,
we don't get separated.

37:51.102 --> 37:53.332
Just promise me
you won't go on a boat ride with him.

38:00.811 --> 38:05.271
Lorna, promise me
you won't go on a boat ride with him.

38:06.417 --> 38:10.148
Beth. It's okay.

38:10.354 --> 38:12.652
- Okay. You promise?
- Okay, okay, okay.

38:13.090 --> 38:14.489
Okay.

38:15.893 --> 38:17.588
Roman.

38:18.362 --> 38:20.330
Okay, two, please.

38:22.133 --> 38:25.762
- Here you go. I'm so sorry about that.
- It's okay.

38:25.970 --> 38:28.336
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Thanks.

38:33.010 --> 38:36.036
So, what brings you
to this corner of the world?

38:36.914 --> 38:39.644
Her. Firestarter.

38:40.851 --> 38:42.341
And you?

38:44.822 --> 38:46.983
I honestly don't know.

38:49.927 --> 38:52.521
I'm sorry, there's probably...

38:52.730 --> 38:55.665
...a small army of Slovak boys
all fighting over you.

38:55.866 --> 38:59.495
Why travel all this way
just to talk with an ugly American?

38:59.704 --> 39:01.695
You're not that ugly.

39:01.906 --> 39:03.430
Really?

39:04.675 --> 39:06.233
Well, cheers to that.

39:06.444 --> 39:07.934
Cheers.

39:08.846 --> 39:10.905
Hey, your friend looks like
she's having fun.

39:12.316 --> 39:13.476
Yeah.

39:13.684 --> 39:16.084
I get to listen to them have sex later.

39:17.788 --> 39:20.313
Can we switch?
I'm over at the Dvorzak hotel and...

39:20.691 --> 39:24.354
...it's probably been three centuries
since anybody's had sex over there.

39:25.563 --> 39:27.690
Oh, maybe your table's ready.

39:29.467 --> 39:32.732
That's-- That's a long story.

39:33.738 --> 39:35.569
Well, I'll have to hear about it
another time.

39:35.840 --> 39:37.774
I'm gonna take off,
but it's a small village...

39:37.975 --> 39:39.966
...l'm sure we'll meet again.
- I'm sure we will.

39:40.177 --> 39:41.940
All right. Good night.

39:42.413 --> 39:43.539
Good night, Beth.

39:45.149 --> 39:46.912
Did I tell you my name?

39:47.218 --> 39:49.379
No, no. I heard your friend use it.

39:49.820 --> 39:53.415
But I forgot to tell you mine. I'm Stuart.

39:53.691 --> 39:55.659
Good to meet you, Stuart.

39:56.193 --> 39:57.717
Good night.

40:08.839 --> 40:10.431
Lorna!

40:13.477 --> 40:14.967
Lorna!

40:21.819 --> 40:23.150
Lorna.

40:24.655 --> 40:26.646
Excuse me.

40:31.962 --> 40:33.224
Lorna!

40:35.633 --> 40:36.793
Lorna!

40:37.802 --> 40:39.963
Beth, I'm sorry!

40:41.038 --> 40:42.903
You promised.

40:43.507 --> 40:45.304
I know.

40:45.509 --> 40:47.500
I'm sorry!

41:26.283 --> 41:28.649
It's so peaceful.

41:29.520 --> 41:31.886
It's so secluded.

41:36.427 --> 41:39.021
Roman, what are you doing?

41:49.406 --> 41:50.373
Come to me.

41:59.183 --> 42:01.151
Close your eyes.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.512
Roman! Roman!

42:07.358 --> 42:10.350
Roman! Roman!

42:10.561 --> 42:12.893
Roman! Roman!

42:32.716 --> 42:34.843
- On a boat
and I have no idea where she is.

42:35.052 --> 42:38.419
- How does she get back from that?
- Beth, come on!

42:39.623 --> 42:41.488
Oh, fuck!

42:43.027 --> 42:44.756
Beth!

42:45.462 --> 42:47.794
I cannot leave her alone with this guy.

42:47.998 --> 42:51.434
You know, you just go ahead
and I'll wait for Lorna.

42:51.635 --> 42:53.603
- You go. Yeah.
- Yeah?

42:53.804 --> 42:55.669
- All right. Thank you so much.
- Okay.

42:55.873 --> 42:57.363
- Sure. Yeah.
- Thank you.

42:57.708 --> 42:59.005
Fuck!

42:59.209 --> 43:01.973
- Dude, are you coming?
- Are you okay?

43:02.179 --> 43:03.874
I'm good. I'm good. No, I'm fine.

43:04.081 --> 43:05.912
- Are you all right?
- Dude, I'm fine.

43:06.250 --> 43:08.275
Have another cocktail.

43:12.756 --> 43:14.621
All right, good night.

43:15.326 --> 43:17.487
No, Whit. We're going to sleep.

43:17.695 --> 43:18.957
- We are?
- Yeah.

43:19.163 --> 43:22.291
Okay, is he hot,
or is he too, like, eastern bloc?

43:22.499 --> 43:25.696
He's fine. But can we please go
get some rest? Come on.

43:25.903 --> 43:27.700
Oh, you're so sweet. No, I'm fine.

43:27.905 --> 43:29.873
It's okay. I'll take care of her.

43:30.274 --> 43:33.869
I'm sure you will, but not tonight,
all right? Good night, Miroslav.

43:34.078 --> 43:36.103
Good night, Miroslav!

43:43.020 --> 43:46.456
I'm sorry. He was just so shady.

43:46.991 --> 43:49.516
Whatever. I wanted to fuck him, but... .

43:49.860 --> 43:53.387
I know you did. I'll make it up to you.

43:54.131 --> 43:57.692
I guess Mr. Rabbit's gonna have to
go down the hole again tonight.

44:00.604 --> 44:02.128
Do you have a AA?

44:02.573 --> 44:04.302
Mr. Rabbit!

44:04.808 --> 44:06.799
Come here, Rabbit!

44:12.483 --> 44:15.111
Do you remember the first guy
in your high school to get laid?

44:15.319 --> 44:16.547
No, but I remember the last.

44:16.754 --> 44:18.915
Well, I do. This kid Greg.

44:19.123 --> 44:23.822
He came back from summer break,
something about him had changed.

44:24.028 --> 44:27.293
It wasn't anything he said or did, but
something was different. You knew it.

44:27.498 --> 44:31.457
I know what you mean. It's like you can
sense it the way an animal senses it.

44:31.669 --> 44:33.159
Exactly. Like an animal.

44:33.437 --> 44:36.895
Sometimes you meet a guy and there's
something fucking scary about him...

44:37.107 --> 44:39.905
...something that makes you think,
"This guy has killed somebody."

44:40.110 --> 44:43.238
He doesn't have to act tough.
He never has to say it.

44:43.447 --> 44:46.075
But like an animal, you can sense it.

44:46.550 --> 44:50.509
You know that this guy's got the balls
to do what few others can.

44:51.288 --> 44:53.313
And that's you after today, my friend.

44:53.524 --> 44:56.584
People are gonna fucking fear you.
Linda is gonna fucking fear you.

44:56.794 --> 45:01.595
What we do today is gonna pay off
every day for the rest of our lives.

45:02.199 --> 45:05.327
- Where's your pager?
- It's back in the room.

45:05.536 --> 45:07.800
- Come on. What the fuck?
- I just figured you had yours.

45:08.005 --> 45:10.803
Is it me? Because it feels like
you're, like, having second thoughts.

45:11.008 --> 45:13.943
You've never really been into this.
I feel like I'm talking you into it.

45:14.144 --> 45:16.704
I don't wanna be doing something
and keep talking about it--

45:16.914 --> 45:21.442
- It's different from taking on an image.
- I am so fucking tired of talking about it.

45:21.652 --> 45:23.950
It's time we fucking do it.

45:33.397 --> 45:34.864
To the next level.

45:35.065 --> 45:37.124
To the next level. No, wait.

45:37.334 --> 45:39.165
Isn't it bad luck to toast with water?

45:39.369 --> 45:43.237
Yeah. Bad luck
for whoever meets us today.

45:47.945 --> 45:50.436
Yeah. Let the games begin.

46:10.968 --> 46:12.526
Hard, hard, hard.

46:12.736 --> 46:14.397
Hey.

46:14.905 --> 46:18.341
- Hey, did she call?
- No. I just checked.

46:18.909 --> 46:21.776
I love that Lorna's the only one of us
that got any action last night.

46:21.979 --> 46:25.346
- Hey, I tried.
- Keep trying.

46:26.150 --> 46:28.675
Yeah, she'd say
this place is majestic.

46:28.886 --> 46:29.853
Sure.

46:30.053 --> 46:31.884
I bet she's making him
breakfast right now.

46:32.089 --> 46:33.613
No, I bet she's in a cum coma.

46:34.391 --> 46:36.086
Thank God.

46:37.394 --> 46:39.692
At least she has something
to write about in her journal.

50:45.575 --> 50:47.065
Please! Please!

50:47.277 --> 50:49.074
Please! Stop!

50:49.346 --> 50:50.472
No!

50:50.680 --> 50:53.274
Stop! Please! Please!

51:00.123 --> 51:01.647
Please! Please!

51:01.858 --> 51:04.554
Please, no!

52:32.582 --> 52:34.209
Relax.

52:38.421 --> 52:40.013
Come up here.

54:12.882 --> 54:14.440
Whit?

54:23.260 --> 54:25.057
Axelle?

54:45.982 --> 54:47.540
Fuck.

54:50.887 --> 54:52.411
Whit!

54:54.324 --> 54:56.121
Guys!

55:00.196 --> 55:02.721
Axelle! Whit!

55:46.810 --> 55:48.243
Stop. Please help me!

55:48.445 --> 55:49.935
- Go away.
- Please help me!

55:50.146 --> 55:51.579
- Just go away from me!
- No, no, no.

55:52.015 --> 55:53.949
Help me.
These men are chasing me. Please.

55:54.150 --> 55:57.950
I tried to help, but you don't listen.
Go away!

56:27.984 --> 56:29.747
Dollar, bitch!

56:38.061 --> 56:39.756
Stop!

57:11.895 --> 57:13.453
Get in.

57:13.696 --> 57:15.163
Yeah.

59:48.651 --> 59:51.211
The police will be here soon.

59:51.854 --> 59:53.913
They are looking for your friends.

59:54.657 --> 59:56.284
Thank-- Thank you.

59:56.893 --> 59:58.417
More tea?

59:58.828 --> 01:00:00.295
Please.

01:00:06.002 --> 01:00:07.435
Thank you.

01:00:22.585 --> 01:00:24.348
So, you and Sasha...

01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:28.222
...are you two...?
- Oh, no. God, no.

01:00:28.424 --> 01:00:30.153
He's old enough to be my dad.

01:00:32.428 --> 01:00:34.055
What does he do?

01:00:34.263 --> 01:00:36.094
He does auctions.

01:00:36.566 --> 01:00:38.966
Come. Let's get you some clothes.

01:01:08.031 --> 01:01:09.828
No!

01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:11.591
No!

01:01:13.636 --> 01:01:16.799
Help! No! No!

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:37.785
What did I do wrong?

01:01:40.663 --> 01:01:44.121
Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me. I'm sorry.

01:01:44.934 --> 01:01:46.731
Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me.

01:01:46.936 --> 01:01:49.131
I not hurt you.

01:01:49.472 --> 01:01:51.838
Okay. It's okay.

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:53.201
I clean you up.

01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:56.544
Please, please help me.

01:01:57.413 --> 01:01:59.404
You have a bruise.

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:04.009
What is that?

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:05.881
What are you doing?

01:02:07.623 --> 01:02:09.557
I make you pretty.

01:02:10.927 --> 01:02:12.360
Pretty for what?

01:02:13.296 --> 01:02:14.991
For the client.

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:17.458
Client? What client?

01:02:45.394 --> 01:02:46.725
Give me. No.

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:47.930
No.

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.158
We do...

01:02:53.035 --> 01:02:54.969
...nails.

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:18.518
No!

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:30.697
No! No!

01:03:36.979 --> 01:03:38.810
Oh, my God.

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:41.815
No!

01:03:51.794 --> 01:03:53.523
I'm worried about Whit.

01:03:55.898 --> 01:03:58.025
Whitney seems like a tough girl.

01:03:58.234 --> 01:04:00.202
She'll be okay.

01:04:03.706 --> 01:04:05.833
You have a scratch.

01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:09.209
Yeah.

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:21.881
- It's sore.
- I'm sorry.

01:04:22.892 --> 01:04:25.793
You have such beautiful skin.

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:27.519
Thank you.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:32.360
Who's that?

01:04:33.402 --> 01:04:35.370
Just some friends.

01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:37.835
Come. You should lie down.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.008
I'll wake you up when the police arrive.

01:06:40.529 --> 01:06:42.326
Do you think we're sick?

01:06:43.866 --> 01:06:45.026
Fuck, no.

01:06:45.768 --> 01:06:48.498
Dude, you look anywhere in the world
where there's no law...

01:06:49.171 --> 01:06:51.901
...whether it's fucking Chad
or New Orleans...

01:06:52.108 --> 01:06:54.133
...and this is the shit
people are doing, bro.

01:06:56.345 --> 01:06:58.279
We're the normal ones.

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:06.214
Any idea what
you're gonna do in there?

01:07:09.525 --> 01:07:11.584
You don't even wanna know.

01:07:13.295 --> 01:07:15.456
You don't even wanna know.

01:10:45.007 --> 01:10:46.565
Jesus.

01:11:56.912 --> 01:11:58.607
They're listening. They're listening.

01:12:00.115 --> 01:12:04.176
Beth, it's me. It's Stuart.
From the fair.

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:07.455
Don't talk loud. Okay?

01:12:07.656 --> 01:12:10.420
If they hear us talking like this...

01:12:10.759 --> 01:12:12.454
...they're gonna fucking kill us both.

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:14.354
You hear me?

01:12:14.897 --> 01:12:16.694
I need to know you're listening.

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:19.892
Okay?

01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:36.848
What the fuck are you doing?

01:12:37.286 --> 01:12:40.585
What is this place?
Where the fuck are we?

01:12:41.623 --> 01:12:43.318
Stuart!

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:48.793
Remember when I said that
I didn't know what I was doing here?

01:12:50.733 --> 01:12:52.257
Well...

01:12:54.136 --> 01:12:56.297
...this is what I'm doing here.

01:12:59.341 --> 01:13:00.808
What is this place?

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:04.808
This place... .

01:13:06.148 --> 01:13:07.945
People come here... .

01:13:09.718 --> 01:13:11.413
People come here to kill people.

01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:16.320
What? Who kills?

01:13:17.259 --> 01:13:19.227
Oh, my God, are they gonna kill us?

01:13:19.795 --> 01:13:20.989
Well...

01:13:22.464 --> 01:13:23.931
...not...

01:13:24.133 --> 01:13:25.361
...us.

01:13:26.668 --> 01:13:28.602
Oh, my God.

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:31.266
Oh, my God. Are you gonna kill me?

01:13:31.473 --> 01:13:34.636
- You're gonna kill me!
- No. No, no! No, no, no.

01:13:34.843 --> 01:13:37.937
No. Jesus, no. No.

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:40.545
Then what the fuck
are you doing here?

01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:42.307
What the fuck are you wearing?

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:44.509
Someone brought me here...

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.449
...the same as you.

01:13:47.389 --> 01:13:49.084
Someone I know.

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:51.859
Look...

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:53.823
...he wanted me to--

01:13:54.029 --> 01:13:56.691
To do this with him.

01:13:57.299 --> 01:13:58.857
What?

01:13:59.301 --> 01:14:00.495
Stuart, please.

01:14:01.203 --> 01:14:03.364
Please just let me go.
Help me get out of this chair.

01:14:03.572 --> 01:14:07.702
Please. Please help me get out of this
chair. Get me out of this chair, please!

01:14:30.265 --> 01:14:33.666
You probably used that face to get
whatever the fuck you wanted.

01:14:34.169 --> 01:14:36.137
Fucking skank.

01:14:49.618 --> 01:14:51.984
Oh, that's fucking rich.

01:14:52.788 --> 01:14:55.120
You should see your fucking face.

01:14:59.061 --> 01:15:02.326
- We gotta get out of here.
- We can't.

01:15:03.065 --> 01:15:05.363
They think you're gonna kill me?

01:15:05.868 --> 01:15:08.063
You're not some monster.

01:15:09.805 --> 01:15:12.103
- I'm not that guy.
- No.

01:15:12.307 --> 01:15:13.535
No, I know.

01:15:13.742 --> 01:15:16.302
- I know you're a good person.
- I'm not that guy.

01:15:17.045 --> 01:15:19.138
I know. Of course not.

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:21.111
I'm not that guy.

01:15:24.419 --> 01:15:27.718
- Okay. Okay.
- I'm not that guy.

01:15:30.626 --> 01:15:32.560
We're gonna get out of here.

01:15:39.434 --> 01:15:41.334
I'm not that guy.

01:15:45.941 --> 01:15:47.966
I'm not that guy.

01:15:50.979 --> 01:15:53.004
I'm not that guy.

01:15:54.116 --> 01:15:55.879
There must be a co--

01:16:18.707 --> 01:16:20.834
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

01:16:36.892 --> 01:16:39.554
Christ! Fuck!

01:16:40.362 --> 01:16:41.727
God!

01:16:43.832 --> 01:16:44.890
Fuck!

01:16:46.168 --> 01:16:49.467
Don't you have family?
Don't you have a wife?

01:16:50.339 --> 01:16:51.806
My wife?

01:16:52.007 --> 01:16:53.702
My wife?

01:16:55.944 --> 01:16:57.775
I'm not allowed to kill my wife.

01:17:18.233 --> 01:17:20.326
- Finish?
- Yeah, I'm finished, all right.

01:17:20.535 --> 01:17:23.402
Hey, hey! You cannot done.

01:17:23.605 --> 01:17:25.300
You go in room, finish.

01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:27.508
You know what? I am fucking done.

01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:30.177
If you don't like it, you can go in
and finish her yourself.

01:17:30.379 --> 01:17:32.973
You cannot leave unless
you complete. It's contract.

01:17:33.181 --> 01:17:34.808
I fucking paid!

01:17:35.017 --> 01:17:36.814
You have my money
and you can keep it!

01:17:37.019 --> 01:17:40.386
I am not going back in that room!
I'm done!

01:17:40.589 --> 01:17:42.454
Hey! Hey!

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:43.582
Hello. Special offer.

01:18:43.785 --> 01:18:47.186
But she's only available
for the next 20 minutes.

01:18:47.422 --> 01:18:49.014
Do you want her?

01:18:53.895 --> 01:18:55.522
We'll let you know.

01:19:36.104 --> 01:19:37.731
Six-fifty.

01:19:56.858 --> 01:19:57.825
Yes?

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:03.195
Apologies for interrupting you, but
we have special available right now.

01:20:03.398 --> 01:20:04.729
Very good price.

01:20:10.605 --> 01:20:12.402
Where's Todd?

01:20:24.719 --> 01:20:26.448
Problem with friend.

01:20:29.858 --> 01:20:32.156
May I borrow this
for a moment, please?

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.024
What do you think?

01:20:40.235 --> 01:20:41.930
Should I do it?

01:20:42.137 --> 01:20:44.367
I mean, I wouldn't pay
more than a grand for her...

01:20:44.573 --> 01:20:46.370
...in this kind of shape, but... .

01:20:46.575 --> 01:20:48.440
I mean, look at that.

01:20:48.643 --> 01:20:50.508
She's not gonna last that long, huh?

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:54.880
You should see
what she did to my friend.

01:21:00.222 --> 01:21:01.621
I'll take her.

01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:44.895
A souvenir from your friend.

01:21:55.043 --> 01:21:57.102
Notice anything different about me?

01:21:59.848 --> 01:22:01.907
I bet you fucking do.

01:22:02.984 --> 01:22:04.781
Fucking bitch.

01:22:09.557 --> 01:22:11.684
Fucking respect me now.

01:22:13.561 --> 01:22:15.961
I don't fucking work for you!

01:22:17.132 --> 01:22:20.260
I don't work all fucking day
for you to humiliate me.

01:22:23.972 --> 01:22:25.132
To tell me I'm shit.

01:22:29.477 --> 01:22:30.910
Never fuck me.

01:22:32.314 --> 01:22:33.872
Look at you.

01:22:34.416 --> 01:22:35.713
What?

01:22:35.917 --> 01:22:38.909
What, you got something to say?
Do you? You do, bitch?

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:42.521
Yeah? Oh, good.
Well, it better be fucking good.

01:22:42.958 --> 01:22:46.450
- Let's fucking hear it. What?
- I'm not your wife.

01:22:46.661 --> 01:22:50.427
I'm not your wife, Stuart.
I'm not your wife.

01:22:51.466 --> 01:22:56.130
She doesn't understand you.
She doesn't understand you like I do.

01:22:56.338 --> 01:22:59.501
- And I see how you're strong.
- I am strong.

01:22:59.708 --> 01:23:02.438
- I am fucking Hercules!
- I see.

01:23:03.378 --> 01:23:05.938
I know. I know. I see it. I see it.

01:23:06.314 --> 01:23:07.713
I saw it last night.

01:23:07.916 --> 01:23:11.477
I was hoping you would kiss me.
I wanted you to kiss me.

01:23:13.254 --> 01:23:15.620
I thought about you all night.

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:24.825
Get on the fucking floor.

01:23:34.809 --> 01:23:36.208
Are you scared?

01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:41.171
You fucking better be.

01:23:42.884 --> 01:23:44.442
I am.

01:23:45.353 --> 01:23:47.150
I like it.

01:24:01.269 --> 01:24:02.827
Look at me.

01:24:05.106 --> 01:24:06.471
Bitch.

01:24:07.842 --> 01:24:10.572
You fucking whore.

01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:37.401
Get in the chair!

01:24:37.605 --> 01:24:39.402
Get in the fucking chair!

01:24:43.611 --> 01:24:45.078
Fucker!

01:25:02.464 --> 01:25:03.431
What's the code?

01:25:03.765 --> 01:25:05.596
Fuck you!

01:25:09.704 --> 01:25:11.262
What's the fucking code?

01:25:14.909 --> 01:25:16.672
- Your birthday.
- What?

01:25:16.878 --> 01:25:18.675
What is your birthday?

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.814
December 12th.

01:25:22.484 --> 01:25:25.112
Oh, that is fucking sick.

01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:43.336
What the fuck? It's not opening.

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:47.836
It's not fucking opening!

01:25:48.042 --> 01:25:49.907
Oh, yes, it is.

01:25:51.179 --> 01:25:54.205
Do it! She's right up there
behind you! Kill her!

01:25:54.415 --> 01:25:57.213
Motherfucker! Shoot her!

01:25:57.552 --> 01:25:59.952
Kill her! Kill her!

01:26:03.224 --> 01:26:04.953
Don't shoot!
Be careful, for God's sakes!

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.151
She'll cut! She'll fucking cut!
Don't shoot!

01:26:07.362 --> 01:26:08.693
Fucking she'll cut! She'll cut!

01:26:09.931 --> 01:26:11.262
Get Sasha!

01:26:11.499 --> 01:26:15.367
You gotta do it! I'm the fucking
customer here! Do it, for fuck's sake.

01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:17.401
Jesus fucking Christ. Oh, shit!

01:26:17.605 --> 01:26:18.663
- Sasha!
- Get him!

01:26:36.524 --> 01:26:38.424
- Wait! I wanna buy my way out of here.
- Wait!

01:26:41.796 --> 01:26:44.788
- You can't afford it.
- Don't tell me what I can't afford.

01:26:44.999 --> 01:26:49.163
There's nothing I can't afford. I could
buy and sell everyone in this room.

01:26:50.305 --> 01:26:52.500
You going to call your parents
for money?

01:26:52.707 --> 01:26:54.800
No, motherfucker, it's my money.

01:26:55.009 --> 01:26:58.001
Just get me a PDA, a SWIFT number
and a recipient name.

01:26:58.213 --> 01:27:01.080
I have accounts in Switzerland,
Luxembourg and the Isle of Man.

01:27:01.282 --> 01:27:05.343
Just name your fucking price!
Trust me, I got it.

01:27:07.222 --> 01:27:08.746
Okay.

01:27:14.295 --> 01:27:15.421
We negotiate.

01:27:16.698 --> 01:27:19.531
- This is bullshit!
- This is business.

01:27:19.834 --> 01:27:20.892
I'll pay more!

01:27:21.336 --> 01:27:23.304
Not with a second mortgage
on your house...

01:27:23.504 --> 01:27:25.563
...and your daughter's
private-school tuition.

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:27.735
That's why your friend pay.

01:27:27.942 --> 01:27:29.807
What's the number?

01:27:30.945 --> 01:27:33.345
Money is not the only issue.

01:27:33.548 --> 01:27:35.175
We have contract here.

01:27:35.984 --> 01:27:37.417
What kind of contract?

01:27:38.886 --> 01:27:41.514
Anyone who come to this place...

01:27:41.723 --> 01:27:43.350
...cannot leave...

01:27:43.558 --> 01:27:45.116
...without killing.

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:49.587
They're still gonna kill you,
you fucking stupid cunt.

01:27:50.999 --> 01:27:52.728
What did you say to me?

01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:57.467
You're a stupid fucking cu--!

01:28:14.355 --> 01:28:15.720
Let him bleed to death.

01:28:17.492 --> 01:28:18.516
Misha, no!

01:28:59.133 --> 01:29:01.067
Isn't this great?

01:29:07.408 --> 01:29:09.672
Hey, get back here!

01:29:11.846 --> 01:29:13.040
Wait!

01:29:13.247 --> 01:29:15.147
Wait! Wait!

01:29:16.918 --> 01:29:18.010
Wait!

01:29:19.153 --> 01:29:20.120
Hey!

01:29:20.555 --> 01:29:23.149
You fucking shit! Wait!

01:34:25.226 --> 01:34:27.126
<i>Bitches!</i>
