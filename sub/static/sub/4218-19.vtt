WEBVTT

00:02.544 --> 00:03.670
Casey!

00:05.339 --> 00:07.382
Previously on
Chicago Fire...

00:07.549 --> 00:09.050
This house
is special.
Why?

00:09.218 --> 00:11.260
Because it has
a Rescue Squad.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.012
They're like,
the best of
the best.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.222
Why aren't
you with them?

00:14.390 --> 00:15.682
I mean, I plan to be.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.558
My father was
a member of
the Squad years ago.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.936
You know I've done
thorough research

00:20.104 --> 00:22.146
on this whole
insemination thing.

00:22.314 --> 00:25.233
Kelly, I wanna know
if you'd like to
have a baby with me.

00:25.401 --> 00:28.027
I wanted to hear,
you know?

00:28.195 --> 00:29.612
I need to know
how my dad died.

00:29.780 --> 00:33.324
In the middle of that fire,
your father panicked
and pulled off his mask.

00:33.492 --> 00:36.411
So I could not in good
faith reward someone for
demonstrating cowardice...

00:40.040 --> 00:41.416
Listen, I know
it's been on
your mind

00:41.583 --> 00:44.419
and I think you'd be
a really great addition
to the squad.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.421
Let's push it,
see what happens.

00:46.588 --> 00:47.755
Okay.

00:47.923 --> 00:49.257
We don't have
to be alone.

00:49.425 --> 00:50.633
Why can't we be happy?

00:50.801 --> 00:52.427
Andy was one of
my best friends.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.303
And he was your husband,
and...

00:54.471 --> 00:56.472
I think
we should honor that.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.436
Hey.

01:01.603 --> 01:03.438
I am so sorry.

01:03.605 --> 01:07.400
I completely zonked out.
No worries.
I didn't want to wake you.

01:07.568 --> 01:08.693
What time is it?

01:08.861 --> 01:10.445
Uh, 7:00.
Oops,

01:10.612 --> 01:12.155
I, uh...

01:12.322 --> 01:14.365
I have to pick up
the boys from Grandma's.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.909
Okay.
Uh, the baking dish
is still dirty,

01:17.077 --> 01:18.453
so I'm gonna wash it.

01:18.620 --> 01:19.829
I'll clean it.
Matt.

01:19.997 --> 01:23.458
I saw this swing set
fort type thing
at True Value.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.710
I've been meaning
to build it for
Griffin and Ben.

01:25.878 --> 01:28.713
I'll bring it
and the dish by
after shift.

01:28.881 --> 01:30.757
If that's cool
with you.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.634
Thank you,
you're...

01:34.636 --> 01:35.803
That's very sweet.

01:35.971 --> 01:37.305
Oh, come on.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.642
Mind if I use
your bathroom?
Of course.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.569
Hey.
Hey.

01:53.322 --> 01:55.198
My dad wanted me
to drop that off.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.492
His way of apologizing
for you catching
that elbow.

01:58.660 --> 01:59.494
Thanks.

01:59.661 --> 02:00.828
All right, well,
I'll see you
at the house.

02:00.996 --> 02:03.581
Do you
have any mouthwash?

02:05.375 --> 02:06.542
Uh...

02:06.710 --> 02:08.169
It's not what you...

02:12.007 --> 02:13.090
Hey.

02:14.676 --> 02:15.676
Hey!

02:17.679 --> 02:20.389
It's not what
you think!
Yeah.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.391
I'm sure you've got it
all figured out.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.528
Hey! Any of
you guys know
John Pritchard,

02:33.695 --> 02:35.530
or were you all
too young?

02:35.697 --> 02:38.533
He was gone before
I came on, but
I heard stories.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.243
Piece of work,
that one.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.453
What, he died
or something?
Yeah!

02:42.621 --> 02:45.540
You know, Boden, Mouch
and me, we all knew
him back in the day.

02:45.707 --> 02:49.043
He must have been
20 years older than Boden
if that tells you anything.

02:49.211 --> 02:50.711
What did he die of?

02:50.879 --> 02:53.130
Old man stuff.
I don't know.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.174
Funeral is tomorrow
up at Grayslake.

02:55.342 --> 02:56.259
Are you guys going?

02:56.426 --> 02:58.928
Yeah, I guess,
you know? We should
pay our respects.

03:00.389 --> 03:02.682
All right.
Hydrant's good
to go.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.730
Peter Mills,
you get to flush
the next one.

03:13.735 --> 03:17.697
By the way,

03:17.865 --> 03:18.781
What the hell's that?

03:18.949 --> 03:20.867
You bet me
I couldn't say
a sentence in Japanese.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.243
I just said one.

03:22.411 --> 03:23.452
You owe me 20 bucks.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.246
Okay. "A", I
don't remember that.

03:25.414 --> 03:26.956
And "B", how do
I know you're not just
speaking gibberish?

03:27.124 --> 03:29.208
It's a sentence.
What's it mean?

03:29.376 --> 03:30.710
Pay me 20 bucks,
I'll tell you.

03:30.878 --> 03:33.588
Ridiculous.
You tell me and...
Help!

03:33.755 --> 03:34.881
Help!

03:40.762 --> 03:41.804
He fell!

03:46.768 --> 03:49.562
We were playing
hide and seek upstairs.

03:55.110 --> 03:56.986
Hang on.
We're coming.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.417
This is 81.
I need a paramedic
across from our firehouse!

04:11.585 --> 04:14.170
What's
the address?
Look for our lights!

04:20.385 --> 04:23.429
Let's go, bro!
Hit it!

04:30.228 --> 04:33.147
His neck's twisted.
He can't breathe.

04:33.315 --> 04:35.858
I told Taye not to
go in the chute!
He knows better!

04:36.026 --> 04:37.610
Come with me.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.368
All right, we have
to get through
this block.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.682
61, we need you
on the second floor.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.266
It's a child.

05:14.523 --> 05:17.316
What's going on?
Kid hid in
the laundry chute.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.276
Mills, get in here.
Yeah!

05:24.616 --> 05:25.825
Dougie?

05:25.993 --> 05:29.203
I told him infinity
times not to hide
in there.

05:31.957 --> 05:34.500
CASEY Okay, let's
peel back the front.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.419
Okay...

05:37.671 --> 05:38.671
Taye?

05:40.882 --> 05:42.466
Ma'am.

05:42.634 --> 05:43.968
Ma'am, don't look.

05:44.136 --> 05:46.595
We'll get him out.
Let them work.
Get his head.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.931
Dougie...
Honey, go upstairs.

05:49.766 --> 05:50.933
Okay.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.393
Oh, God.

05:53.854 --> 05:54.812
Let's back him out.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.647
Don't look.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.692
Grab his legs.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.194
He's conscious,
but barely.
Taye!

06:02.362 --> 06:03.821
Okay, okay.

06:05.657 --> 06:06.699
Grab his legs.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.786
Let's
board him, quickly.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.247
Hold on to me.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.043
One, two, three.

06:20.297 --> 06:21.630
You the mother?
Yes.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.258
You can ride
in the back with me.
Let's go.

06:24.426 --> 06:25.634
Go on.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.563
I'll be right back.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.740
What have you heard?

06:47.908 --> 06:49.033
Um...

06:50.577 --> 06:52.745
The doctor says
it looks bad.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.206
It's a damaged windpipe,

06:55.373 --> 06:56.874
so his brain was

06:57.751 --> 06:58.918
without oxygen.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.756
Well, they've got
great surgeons here.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.049
They'll do
everything
they can.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.052
You know...

07:10.263 --> 07:12.473
Taye has been
to your firehouse.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.477
Oh, yeah?

07:16.645 --> 07:18.437
His whole class
went on a field trip

07:18.605 --> 07:21.690
last fall when
the school year
started.

07:21.858 --> 07:24.360
It was all
he could talk
about for days.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.784
He said he wants
to be a fireman,

07:32.786 --> 07:34.161
help people.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.789
That's...

07:37.791 --> 07:39.959
That's sweet.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.128
Gangs are always calling,

07:43.713 --> 07:45.297
but he won't bite.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.679
He's gonna be
straight and narrow,

07:51.847 --> 07:53.764
and I believe that.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.231
I'm sure he will.

08:04.860 --> 08:06.318
Thank you.

08:13.910 --> 08:14.994
You gotta be
kidding me.

08:15.162 --> 08:18.998
I don't know if I can
handle another season
like the last one.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.541
Hope springs eternal.

08:20.709 --> 08:22.751
Hope never met
a Sox September.

08:22.919 --> 08:26.380
Yeah, well at least you
guys have a series win
in the last century.

08:26.548 --> 08:27.673
Try being a Cubs fan.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.718
There's plenty of room
on the bandwagon if you want
to move to the south side.

08:30.886 --> 08:32.178
Yeah.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.471
What are you, Pouch?
You Cubs or Sox, huh?

08:34.639 --> 08:36.682
Look at her feet.
She's definitely
a White Sox fan.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.393
Guys, put a cork in it.
I'm trying to listen
to the Hawk.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.857
What does that mean?

08:45.025 --> 08:46.734
Hey, if they score,
come get me.

08:46.902 --> 08:48.360
Saikensha...

08:51.072 --> 08:52.406
Hey, Lieutenant.

08:52.574 --> 08:57.203
I wanted to bring you up
to speed on what Kelly's
just filled me in on.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.414
I'm gonna push
to fast-track
Peter Mills to Squad.

09:00.624 --> 09:03.584
The youngest
anyone's ever
made it was 23.

09:03.752 --> 09:04.585
You.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.045
I think Mills can
break the record.

09:06.213 --> 09:09.006
And I talked to
Chief Walker
over at District,

09:09.174 --> 09:11.383
and he thinks it
would be great
for CFD morale.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.430
Is that what
you think, Chief?
Great for morale?

09:17.307 --> 09:18.891
As long as
he qualifies.

09:19.851 --> 09:20.976
Well,

09:22.312 --> 09:24.980
sounds like
you guys have all
the answers.

09:31.655 --> 09:32.613
You wanted
to see me, Chief?

09:32.781 --> 09:35.241
As you're aware,
Lieutenant Severide

09:35.408 --> 09:38.869
thinks that you'll
make a strong addition
to Rescue Squad.

09:39.704 --> 09:41.163
Yes.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.415
I just want to hear
your take on it.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.376
I'm gonna bust
my ass to make
it happen.

09:46.461 --> 09:47.628
Why?

09:47.796 --> 09:49.255
I'm sorry?

09:49.422 --> 09:50.631
Why's it so
important to you?

09:50.799 --> 09:52.925
'Cause I want to be
an elite firefighter, sir.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.678
And this has got
nothing to do with
your father?

09:57.055 --> 09:58.347
No, sir.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.559
This has nothing
to do with what
my father did

10:02.727 --> 10:04.812
or did not do
with his time at CFD.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.483
This is about me.

10:11.903 --> 10:15.239
Well, since you've
been here you've
put on ten pounds.

10:16.408 --> 10:17.825
Which, from
where I sit,

10:19.577 --> 10:21.829
doesn't look like
a candidate willing
to bust his ass.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.552
Hey, how's it going?

10:36.720 --> 10:38.429
Been better.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.597
You need me to
take care of someone?
Give me a name.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.057
Not now.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.819
Heather Darden and me,

10:53.987 --> 10:55.362
we're just friends.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.489
She came over
to talk and fell
asleep on my couch.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.033
Right. Got it.

11:00.285 --> 11:02.578
I don't know
what you want me
to say here.

11:02.746 --> 11:04.538
I saw what
I saw, Casey.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.874
Sell your clean whistle
act to someone else,
'cause I ain't buying.

11:07.042 --> 11:09.001
You can't imagine you
might be wrong about
something, can you?

11:09.169 --> 11:11.837
I can imagine
a lot of things,

11:12.005 --> 11:13.839
just not the idea of
you rolling around
with Andy's widow.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.384
Come on.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.805
Explain to me
why Heather
barely talks to me,

11:21.973 --> 11:23.432
but she'll sleep with you,

11:23.600 --> 11:25.809
even though you're
the guy who put her
husband through that window?

11:25.977 --> 11:27.770
Get down!

11:28.772 --> 11:29.772
Get down!

11:30.982 --> 11:32.608
What the hell
is going on here?

11:32.776 --> 11:34.693
You okay?

11:35.779 --> 11:37.780
Casey, are you okay?
Yeah.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.620
What the hell
is going on here,
Detective?

11:44.788 --> 11:46.580
This has always been
a neighborhood house.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.290
You tell me.

11:48.458 --> 11:49.625
No run-ins recently?

11:49.793 --> 11:52.628
No fires where one
of your guys tried to
pop off to the local...

11:52.796 --> 11:54.630
No.
We're not cops.

11:54.798 --> 11:57.800
People are happy
to see a firefighter
show up.

11:58.802 --> 12:00.302
Could this be
Voight-related?

12:01.554 --> 12:02.471
Voight?

12:02.639 --> 12:05.557
When it comes
to gang violence,
the man has a long reach.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.518
He's got a dismissal
hearing soon.

12:13.483 --> 12:17.611
Not like Voight
to stir up the nest if
he's trying to free himself.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.071
Man, why don't
you pick up one
of these bangers

12:19.239 --> 12:21.698
for something small and trade
the bust for what they know
about the shooters?

12:21.866 --> 12:23.909
Corner boys in
this neighborhood
are good.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.787
We can't catch them
with the drugs
and make a bust stick.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.247
We'll keep
our ears to
the ground.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.499
In the meantime,
I'll make sure we
have a conspicuous

12:30.667 --> 12:31.792
police presence
around the station.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.127
Meaning what?

12:33.294 --> 12:36.713
Put a special
detail on it.
Squad outside.

12:36.881 --> 12:39.007
Officer posted
in the house.

12:43.847 --> 12:46.849
Well, that's fine.
So long as
the men are safe.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.150
What?

12:57.902 --> 13:00.154
Cops in the house
is a bad precedent.

13:00.321 --> 13:03.991
Sends a message
to the good residents
around here that

13:04.159 --> 13:05.576
we're not a safe haven.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.578
You rather have
one of us be killed?

13:07.745 --> 13:08.662
Of course not.

13:08.830 --> 13:12.124
We will let the police
handle their business,
and we...

13:13.376 --> 13:14.626
Will handle ours.

13:38.776 --> 13:40.402
Never seen anything
like this before.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.154
So much for being
the neighborhood's
house.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.873
Here you go.
Thanks.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.542
Thanks.
Yeah.

14:37.460 --> 14:40.546
Hey, any word on
that kid pulled out of
the laundry chute?

14:40.713 --> 14:42.673
I haven't heard
anything yet.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.216
Hey, what's going on
with you and Casey?

14:44.384 --> 14:45.467
It seemed like...
Oh, I don't...

14:45.635 --> 14:47.469
I don't want to
talk about Casey.

14:47.637 --> 14:48.679
Okay, fine.

14:48.846 --> 14:52.182
We'll just enjoy
watching you two mark
your territory.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.477
So what do
you want to
talk about?

14:57.105 --> 14:59.064
So how would
this work?

14:59.232 --> 15:01.567
With the, um...
Insemination?

15:03.152 --> 15:04.278
Well,

15:05.280 --> 15:07.906
basically, you know,
I'd get

15:08.074 --> 15:10.659
a hormone injection
once a day for 12 days

15:10.827 --> 15:12.703
to boost ovulation,
then we'd

15:12.870 --> 15:14.997
go to a clinic where

15:15.164 --> 15:18.041
they have rooms
set aside
for collection.

15:18.209 --> 15:21.253
Meaning, you know,
they give you magazines
or whatever,

15:21.421 --> 15:22.421
and you go in
and do your business.
I mean,

15:22.589 --> 15:24.673
I get that part.

15:26.759 --> 15:27.884
How much does it cost?

15:29.095 --> 15:31.930
Uh, all-in,
10 grandish.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.766
10 grand, are
you serious?

15:34.934 --> 15:35.934
Yeah.

15:37.645 --> 15:38.729
You have that
kind of cash?

15:38.896 --> 15:42.357
I'm gonna stretch
some card limits
and cobble it together.

16:01.336 --> 16:02.586
I'm in.

16:35.119 --> 16:36.161
What?

16:36.329 --> 16:38.205
You picked
him up first?

16:40.708 --> 16:41.625
Just get in.

16:41.793 --> 16:45.170
Now I gotta stare
at the back of your
head for an hour?

16:45.338 --> 16:46.672
Yeah.

16:46.839 --> 16:50.425
Guess it's better
than getting shot at
at the firehouse.

16:56.057 --> 17:00.227
So I come home,
try to climb in through
the window, but it's shut.

17:00.395 --> 17:02.979
It's locked.
I thought I got a clean
getaway, but no.

17:03.147 --> 17:06.191
Now I gotta go around
and ring on
the damn doorbell.

17:08.653 --> 17:10.487
My old man,
he's just sitting
in his chair.

17:10.655 --> 17:12.489
Waiting for me.
For hours.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.908
3:00 in the morning.
Alcohol on my breath.

17:15.076 --> 17:17.494
Ooh!
He just stares at me,
hard as nails.

17:17.662 --> 17:20.205
He says, "Boy, you got
four choices where
you're going to college...

17:20.373 --> 17:22.499
"Army, Navy, Air Force,
Marines... Pick one."

17:22.667 --> 17:24.084
Wow!

17:24.252 --> 17:26.128
At least your
old man gave a damn.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.505
Oh, Bill Herrmann
wasn't so bad.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.382
I'm friends with Chris's
older brother Larry.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.510
Your dad would throw
the ball with us
when he was home.

17:33.678 --> 17:37.013
Larry did not disappoint
him the way that I did.

17:37.181 --> 17:39.015
You never
told me about
your dad.

17:39.851 --> 17:43.353
Aw, sold luggage
to department stores
all over the Midwest.

17:43.521 --> 17:45.814
He was on the road
more than he was home.

17:45.982 --> 17:47.524
Is that right?

17:47.692 --> 17:49.025
He wanted me
to chase him into
the business

17:49.193 --> 17:50.527
like my brother Larry did,

17:50.695 --> 17:53.405
so naturally
I took the
fireman's test.

17:56.701 --> 17:59.202
They got this
whole thing...

17:59.370 --> 18:00.912
Larry and my dad.

18:05.626 --> 18:08.044
I don't talk to him
that much anymore.

18:10.882 --> 18:12.716
You should call him.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.262
I should.

18:18.139 --> 18:21.475
It'd be that much
worse when he didn't
call me back.

18:31.736 --> 18:32.861
What are you doing here?

18:33.029 --> 18:34.613
Maybe being quiet
and keeping to yourself

18:34.781 --> 18:36.406
is how it works
in the Mills family,

18:36.574 --> 18:38.241
but that's not how
the Dawsons do it.

18:38.409 --> 18:39.576
Is that so?

18:39.744 --> 18:42.579
Look, if you want
to fly solo,

18:42.747 --> 18:44.998
you better do it
in bed with your
eyes closed, okay?

18:45.166 --> 18:47.584
But you want to train
for Squad, you better get
ready to talk while you run,

18:47.752 --> 18:50.337
'cause I'm coming with you.

18:50.505 --> 18:51.588
Hey.

18:52.757 --> 18:54.966
I want to be a part
of whatever comes
your way.

19:03.267 --> 19:06.061
Well, then you better
tie your shoes first.

19:06.896 --> 19:08.897
Oh!

19:09.065 --> 19:10.816
Oh, I'm gonna
get you!

19:16.948 --> 19:19.950
This is the right
time, right?
Paper said 3:30.

19:25.706 --> 19:28.166
Excuse me, is this
the Pritchard funeral?
Yes. Yes.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.251
We're about to
get underway.

19:29.418 --> 19:30.836
Oh.
Have a seat.

19:32.547 --> 19:34.172
Thanks.
Thanks.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.149
Are you kidding
me with this?

19:54.360 --> 19:55.944
Didn't he have,
like, five sons?

19:56.112 --> 19:58.864
Yeah.
Where's his family?

19:59.031 --> 20:00.532
Welcome, friends.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.535
We're all here today
not to grieve

20:03.703 --> 20:05.912
but to celebrate
the life of...

20:07.415 --> 20:09.165
John Aaron Pritchard.

20:11.335 --> 20:15.338
Matthew 5:4 says,
"Blessed are they
who mourn,

20:15.506 --> 20:16.756
"for they shall be comforted."

20:17.800 --> 20:19.926
Let's get out of here.

20:20.094 --> 20:21.219
Amen.

20:23.347 --> 20:27.058
So, like, I mean,
that's it?

20:27.226 --> 20:29.102
I mean...

20:29.270 --> 20:31.354
Half a dozen people,

20:31.522 --> 20:33.231
and no family,

20:33.399 --> 20:36.568
and a preacher
who doesn't even
know his name

20:36.736 --> 20:38.695
without looking
at the program.

20:38.863 --> 20:41.448
I mean, where's
the truck with
a half-raised ladder

20:41.616 --> 20:43.158
and salute to
a fallen firefighter?

20:43.326 --> 20:45.285
Chris...
No, I'm serious.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.455
What's my funeral
gonna be like
when I kick it?

20:48.623 --> 20:51.583
Or yours, Mouch, huh?
Doubt I'll care.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.376
All the same,

20:53.544 --> 20:57.422
he deserved a funeral
with respect for
all of his service.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.592
And just because
he waited a dozen
years to die

21:00.760 --> 21:04.554
and moved out to
the sticks doesn't mean
he wasn't a hero.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.933
Let's go.
Shotgun!

21:08.893 --> 21:11.770
This...
This ain't right!

21:24.158 --> 21:26.451
Any words on
the shooters?
Nada.

21:31.374 --> 21:32.332
How was the funeral?

21:32.500 --> 21:35.043
What's worse
than terrible?
It was that.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.923
What?
Oven's busted.

21:40.091 --> 21:41.800
What?
Blender is, too.

21:51.811 --> 21:52.811
Bad news.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.897
Remember that kid
from last shift?

21:56.065 --> 21:57.649
Jumped in
the laundry chute?

21:57.817 --> 21:59.150
Yeah.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.777
Didn't make it.

22:10.204 --> 22:11.955
He came here,
this kid.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.500
He was here on
a class field trip.

22:19.213 --> 22:21.673
He told his mom he
wanted to be a fireman
when he got home.

22:23.217 --> 22:24.968
Wow, I recognize him.

22:25.845 --> 22:29.431
It was my first day.
You guys had me
give the tour.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.976
Man, I remember that.

22:33.144 --> 22:34.561
Funeral's on Friday.

22:44.155 --> 22:49.617
Hey, Pop,
it's Christopher.
Just checking in.

22:49.785 --> 22:52.537
I know it's been
a while, and...

22:52.705 --> 22:55.081
Anyway, just call
me back.

23:08.304 --> 23:10.680
You know what
the worst part is?

23:12.183 --> 23:13.975
What is the worst part, Kelly?

23:14.143 --> 23:17.729
That you don't have
enough sack to admit
you're sleeping with Heather.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.230
At least come clean.

23:19.398 --> 23:20.899
Keep walking.

23:21.901 --> 23:22.859
I'm done explaining myself.

23:23.027 --> 23:25.904
You haven't explained
a damn thing!
That's the point!

23:26.072 --> 23:27.906
'Cause you're wrong!

23:30.910 --> 23:32.744
Don't come up on me
again like this.
Really?

23:32.912 --> 23:35.038
What the hell
is going on here?

23:39.085 --> 23:40.919
In my office... Now.

23:52.389 --> 23:55.558
We've been here before.
Almost tore this house apart.

23:55.726 --> 23:56.810
This time, it's different.

23:56.977 --> 23:57.977
Tell me about it.

24:00.356 --> 24:02.732
Yeah, Casey,
tell him about it.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.741
No offense, Chief.

24:18.332 --> 24:20.625
So what do you think
about this whole
Casey/Heather thing?

24:20.793 --> 24:23.211
Uh...
I don't know.

24:23.379 --> 24:24.587
Hmm. You haven't
asked him?

24:24.755 --> 24:27.590
We've said like
two sentences to
each other in a month.

24:27.758 --> 24:30.593
Hey. What's your name?

24:30.761 --> 24:33.805
Phillip.
All right,
let's get you up, Phillip.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.390
Come on.

24:35.558 --> 24:37.267
Here we go.

24:38.769 --> 24:41.271
Whoa!
Phillip,

24:41.438 --> 24:44.607
that is not the kind
of full moon I was
expecting to see today.

24:44.775 --> 24:45.650
Come on.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.653
Here we go.
All right, keep
your pants up.

24:48.821 --> 24:51.614
Whew! So Severide's

24:51.782 --> 24:53.658
little swimmers, huh?

24:53.826 --> 24:56.202
Yeah.
And who's paying
for this?

24:57.121 --> 24:58.788
I don't know.

24:58.956 --> 25:02.208
You know,
there's another,
cheaper alternative.

25:02.376 --> 25:03.793
Oh, come on.
What?

25:03.961 --> 25:05.461
I'm just saying.
Oh, boy.

25:05.629 --> 25:09.382
Nature has already
worked out a lot
of these details.

25:13.679 --> 25:15.638
I need a 10-1 to
East Van Buren, now!

25:15.806 --> 25:16.639
What's
the nature of the call?

25:16.807 --> 25:18.808
Someone's stealing
our ambulance!

25:36.994 --> 25:38.328
Hey!

25:38.495 --> 25:40.288
What the hell?
Pull over!

25:40.456 --> 25:43.333
Shut up!
You can't steal
an ambulance!

25:43.500 --> 25:45.710
I said shut up!
Listen to me, moron.

25:45.878 --> 25:48.046
Quit talking to me!

25:55.095 --> 25:58.514
This ambulance has GPS!
They can track us in the city

25:58.682 --> 26:00.683
so they know where
we're at, at all times!

26:00.851 --> 26:03.686
When you hear the beep,
that means that they're about
to shut down the engine!

26:03.854 --> 26:04.812
What are you talking about?

26:04.980 --> 26:06.231
They're gonna
turn off the engine,

26:06.398 --> 26:07.690
lock up the tires,
and send your face

26:07.858 --> 26:09.067
flying through
the windshield!

26:09.235 --> 26:12.278
That ain't true!

26:16.492 --> 26:17.408
Here it comes!

26:19.161 --> 26:21.079
You should buckle up!

26:23.874 --> 26:25.875
Damn it!

26:45.229 --> 26:46.729
Somebody call for
an ambulance?

26:49.024 --> 26:50.733
Come on, Phillip.

26:55.531 --> 26:56.739
Hey.
Hey.

26:59.493 --> 27:02.537
I know this may not
be the best time,

27:02.705 --> 27:03.579
um...

27:03.747 --> 27:06.249
But I have
a new proposal.

27:06.417 --> 27:10.003
So please don't
say anything
or make any funny faces.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.587
Okay.
Okay.

27:12.715 --> 27:14.090
Uh...

27:14.258 --> 27:16.175
I can't afford
the insemination.

27:16.343 --> 27:18.761
So I've been
thinking about plan "B".

27:20.097 --> 27:22.307
And I propose...

27:23.600 --> 27:24.600
When the time is right,

27:24.768 --> 27:27.145
you go into
your room with
magazines or Skinemax

27:27.313 --> 27:29.856
or whatever you need
to get yourself ready.

27:30.024 --> 27:31.190
And then
with the lights out,

27:31.358 --> 27:33.776
you signal me
by calling out
my name once.

27:33.944 --> 27:36.279
You'll hear
your door open,

27:36.447 --> 27:37.405
footsteps.

27:37.573 --> 27:39.407
And then
you'll be mounted.

27:40.701 --> 27:44.412
You will finish your business
inside of me as quickly
and efficiently as possible.

27:44.580 --> 27:45.830
And then
I'll be out
the door,

27:45.998 --> 27:47.790
so you can clean up or
whatever you need to do.

27:47.958 --> 27:50.626
At which point,
I will need to be alone.

27:50.794 --> 27:52.628
Most likely to cry.

27:52.796 --> 27:56.549
And we will never speak
of this to anyone ever

27:57.801 --> 27:58.843
For the rest of our lives.

27:59.011 --> 28:02.138
And... I thank you
for listening.

28:02.306 --> 28:03.806
Just think about it.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.978
Here we go.
Here we go.

28:53.649 --> 28:55.233
What the hell
are you doing?

28:55.401 --> 28:57.735
I'm not standing near
any windows.

28:57.903 --> 29:01.948
Well, it ain't exactly easy
to watch the ballgame with
you staring back at me.

29:03.784 --> 29:07.203
You think the shooters
are going to text you
before they open fire?

29:07.371 --> 29:09.872
I broke down
and called
my old man.

29:12.167 --> 29:13.876
I got nothing back.

29:15.170 --> 29:17.839
Mills, what's for lunch?

29:18.006 --> 29:20.091
Oh, um,

29:20.259 --> 29:22.218
I was bringing in some
beef tips, but I don't

29:22.386 --> 29:23.719
think they're gonna taste
that good raw,

29:23.887 --> 29:28.057
so we can do
some pimento cheese
sandwiches...

29:28.225 --> 29:29.600
How about Al's Beef?

29:29.768 --> 29:30.977
Okay, all right.
We'll do Al's Beef.

29:31.145 --> 29:32.603
Call it in.
I will.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.814
Oh, Otis!
Yeah?

29:34.982 --> 29:37.984
Uh,

29:38.861 --> 29:41.737
Seriously,
up yours, Mouch.

29:41.905 --> 29:43.990
Hey, you know who knows
how to translate that?

29:44.158 --> 29:45.700
Andrew Jackson.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.705
Dawson, where's Shay?

29:50.873 --> 29:52.874
Uh, I don't know.
This is Tara Little.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.333
She's a candidate.

29:54.501 --> 29:58.254
She's gonna be riding along
with you guys for the next
few shifts for evaluation.

29:58.422 --> 30:00.673
Cool.
Hey, so nice
to meet you.

30:00.841 --> 30:01.841
I've heard
a lot about you.

30:02.009 --> 30:05.094
Oh, don't pay any
attention to what these
guys have to say.

30:05.262 --> 30:07.430
Especially Frick
and Frack over here.

30:07.598 --> 30:09.432
Oh, which one's Frick?

30:10.559 --> 30:11.893
Come on.

30:18.942 --> 30:20.026
What's that?

30:20.194 --> 30:23.946
Oh, it's... Yeah,
I keep the cooking club
cash hidden here.

30:25.908 --> 30:27.575
That's cool, right?

30:33.957 --> 30:34.916
Yeah.

30:35.083 --> 30:37.710
Yeah, it's fine.
I'll get the food.

30:37.878 --> 30:40.338
No, I don't mind.
I'll grab it.
I got it.

31:10.494 --> 31:11.994
I want to talk to
whoever's in charge.

31:12.162 --> 31:13.955
Nah, get back
in your truck.

31:14.122 --> 31:15.957
I'm not a cop.
I'm not armed.

31:16.124 --> 31:19.043
Nah, man, get back
in your truck.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.003
I just want to talk.

31:35.185 --> 31:36.852
You in charge?

31:37.020 --> 31:38.813
Who wants to know?

31:45.070 --> 31:46.320
My name's Casey,

31:46.488 --> 31:48.823
I'm the Lieutenant
at Firehouse 51
down the street.

31:50.450 --> 31:51.450
So?

31:56.832 --> 32:01.085
Someone tried to pop
a couple shots into our
house in broad daylight.

32:03.130 --> 32:05.673
Could have
killed someone.

32:05.841 --> 32:09.093
Someone who works
to protect this neighborhood
every single day.

32:10.053 --> 32:11.721
Now I know why.

32:12.681 --> 32:15.850
You guys hide your drugs
in the hydrants, don't you?

32:19.855 --> 32:22.898
Look, we
have to flush those
hydrants twice a year.

32:23.942 --> 32:27.570
Otherwise one of these
buildings is on fire...
Yours maybe.

32:27.738 --> 32:31.032
It burns down
because there's no
water in our hoses.

32:31.199 --> 32:32.158
You know,

32:32.326 --> 32:33.993
I'm not stupid enough
to think that

32:34.161 --> 32:36.495
you're gonna give up
selling your junk
because I come in here,

32:36.663 --> 32:39.790
but I'm telling you,
you hide it in
the hydrants,

32:40.834 --> 32:42.335
it's gonna get flushed.

32:46.798 --> 32:47.965
You done?

32:50.802 --> 32:51.802
No.

32:52.804 --> 32:55.640
Like it or not,
we all gotta
coexist here,

32:55.807 --> 32:56.807
right?

32:57.851 --> 32:59.852
This is our
neighborhood.

33:00.854 --> 33:02.730
You don't own it.

33:15.911 --> 33:18.204
Hey. Guess what?

33:18.372 --> 33:19.580
What's up?

33:19.748 --> 33:21.540
Well, my dad
just called.

33:21.708 --> 33:23.626
He's gonna pay for
the insemination.

33:26.088 --> 33:28.214
Says he was worried
that he'd never
be a grandpa.

33:29.716 --> 33:31.300
That's great.
Yeah.

33:31.468 --> 33:32.718
So you know,

33:33.804 --> 33:35.596
back to plan "A".

33:49.319 --> 33:51.153
You know what?

33:51.321 --> 33:52.321
Fine.

33:58.745 --> 34:01.664
"Creditors have better
memories than debtors."

34:18.432 --> 34:19.765
Hey, Lieutenant,

34:19.933 --> 34:21.976
okay if we make
a quick stop?

34:22.144 --> 34:23.811
Won't take long,
I promise.

34:23.979 --> 34:24.937
Sure.

34:25.105 --> 34:26.772
Cruz, take a right here.

34:31.778 --> 34:34.113
- This the right place?
- This is it.

34:36.783 --> 34:38.743
Aw, come on, Mouch.

34:40.912 --> 34:43.414
What is this?
Just wait.

34:43.582 --> 34:45.708
I want you
to see this.
Yeah.

34:48.211 --> 34:50.796
Randy! How are you?
What do you say, Larry?

34:52.799 --> 34:53.924
Chris.

34:54.801 --> 34:56.469
Hey, Larry,
how you been?

34:56.636 --> 34:58.971
You're not getting away
with a handshake.
Come here, little brother.

34:59.139 --> 35:00.806
Yeah, good
to see you.

35:00.974 --> 35:02.141
All right.
Hey.

35:02.309 --> 35:04.602
Wow, you guys
have grown.

35:05.645 --> 35:07.646
Yeah. How long has
it been since
you've been here?

35:07.814 --> 35:10.858
I don't remember.

35:11.026 --> 35:13.235
Is, uh, Dad around?

35:13.403 --> 35:15.154
No, he's in Boston.

35:15.322 --> 35:16.655
He's supposed
to be selling socks

35:16.823 --> 35:18.657
to Filene's Basement,
but he's probably
already in line

35:18.825 --> 35:20.451
for bleacher seats
at Fenway.

35:22.287 --> 35:24.663
Randy called
and said you were
down about Dad.

35:24.831 --> 35:26.665
So come on.

35:26.833 --> 35:29.251
There's something
you should see.

35:52.859 --> 35:56.362
You should
hear him talk about
his son the firefighter.

35:56.530 --> 35:58.864
I can't get him
to shut up about it.

36:49.624 --> 36:50.749
Okay.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.045
Mrs. Leppert.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.755
Chief.

37:03.388 --> 37:04.555
Hello.

37:06.349 --> 37:08.767
I'm sorry
to bother you.
No, not at all.

37:10.353 --> 37:12.313
We're all
very sorry about
your son.

37:13.773 --> 37:15.024
Thank you.

37:18.194 --> 37:20.446
You may know
he was here once.

37:22.449 --> 37:23.616
And...

37:23.783 --> 37:26.076
He wanted to be
a fireman ever since.

37:29.873 --> 37:34.001
Anyway, he would have
been happy to know
you guys were there...

37:34.169 --> 37:35.628
At the end.

37:38.840 --> 37:41.759
And he would
have wanted you
to have this.

37:49.434 --> 37:51.226
Thank you

37:51.394 --> 37:53.812
for what you do
in this neighborhood.

37:56.816 --> 37:58.108
Thank you.

38:19.756 --> 38:21.507
We owe this kid.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.304
We owe Taye
better than this.

38:34.604 --> 38:36.563
We are better than this.

39:18.523 --> 39:19.773
I have an idea.

40:01.066 --> 40:02.733
Ten-hut!

40:05.945 --> 40:08.280
Present arms!
