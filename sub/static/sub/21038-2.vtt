WEBVTT

00:49.360 --> 00:51.544
(Gulls crying)

01:30.720 --> 01:33.097
MINER: You settling well down here, Drake?

01:35.880 --> 01:37.745
SAM: Yet Jesus did also say,

01:37.920 --> 01:39.467
"Let he who is without sin

01:39.640 --> 01:41.585
cast the first stone."

01:41.760 --> 01:44.740
I speak to ye now as a fellow sinner.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.061
Will you rise with me
from the Slough of Despond?

01:50.640 --> 01:54.269
If he wished for an easy life, he'd do well
to keep his head down and his mouth shut.

01:54.440 --> 01:56.863
- ...having no claim to the...
- Is he giving you trouble?

01:57.040 --> 02:00.100
Nay, he do labour hard as any. More than most.

02:01.160 --> 02:05.620
Ah. Truth is, in time of war and famine, there's
plenty looking for something to believe in.

02:05.800 --> 02:10.180
...a living soul and stamped that soul
with the image of God.

02:10.360 --> 02:13.147
It's free grace that formed man of the dust...

02:15.840 --> 02:17.819
(Low chatter)

02:19.240 --> 02:21.026
(Low chatter continues)

02:22.560 --> 02:25.745
Did I mention that Verity will join us
for the christening?

02:25.920 --> 02:28.138
-Indeed.
- That's my aunt.

02:28.320 --> 02:30.424
She's a Poldark, like me and Aunt Agatha.

02:30.600 --> 02:33.865
Will the other Poldarks be coming?
The ones at Nampara?

02:35.080 --> 02:39.301
My clear, it is your good fortune to be
unacquainted with the Nampara Poldarks

02:39.480 --> 02:42.347
and long may you remain so blessed.

02:42.520 --> 02:47.457
Ross Poldark has chosen to sever all ties with
his Trenwith relations...

02:49.320 --> 02:53.745
...and we feel nothing but relief
at being spared his intrusions.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.740
(Clears throat)

03:19.440 --> 03:24.503
Thank 'ee, Lord, for sending us these gifts:
this food, this water...

03:24.680 --> 03:26.386
This house.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.221
By the grace of God.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.265
By the grace of Cap/7 R055.

03:31.640 --> 03:34.200
Yet 'tis the Lord have guided he
to offer such a thing.

03:34.360 --> 03:37.545
On the contrary.
It was the tip of your sister's foot did that.

03:38.360 --> 03:40.578
It will be a fine place to start our mission.

03:40.760 --> 03:43.422
And so we pray for new beams
to mend our broken roof

03:43.600 --> 03:47.787
and then we'll do everything in our power to
bring redemption to the dark places of Cornwall.

03:47.960 --> 03:49.985
PRUDIE: Good luck with that.

03:51.280 --> 03:53.259
Is Trenwith such a place?

03:55.600 --> 03:57.739
Why do you ask?

03:57.920 --> 04:01.697
I've heard tell 'twas once your family home,
but now it's fallen into unfriendly hands.

04:04.200 --> 04:09.263
It has...and you'll favour me
by never setting foot on Trenwith land...

04:11.880 --> 04:15.065
...or having dealings with any of the household.

04:20.320 --> 04:21.981
(Thunder rumbling, wind billowing)

04:30.360 --> 04:32.783
- (Sighs)
- Did you need to forbid them?

04:33.680 --> 04:35.784
They're unlike' to go looking for trouble.

04:35.960 --> 04:38.064
Knowing them, it'll find them anyway.

04:39.160 --> 04:41.469
- As it oft seems to find you.
- (Chuckles)

04:41.640 --> 04:43.619
Those days are done.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.140
I'm a respectable country squire now...

04:46.320 --> 04:49.699
- (Laughs)
- ..with a home, a mine...

04:51.000 --> 04:53.639
...a family, a wife.

04:54.880 --> 04:57.462
I shall make the most of what life has to offer.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.379
Including me?

05:01.440 --> 05:03.419
Especially you.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.098
- (Clatter)
- Alackaday!

05:32.280 --> 05:36.341
It is a fearful thing to be a poor maid
with no man to care for her.

05:36.520 --> 05:39.739
- Would 'ee like for I to help 'ee?
- 'Tis kindly thought.

05:39.920 --> 05:45.620
Since my old man did cart off, old Prudie
have had to tend to these needs herself.

05:47.600 --> 05:51.787
Not to mention...other needs a body might have.

05:59.760 --> 06:00.943
(Giggles)

06:18.600 --> 06:21.103
Seems a lifetime since I married Dwight...

06:22.520 --> 06:24.101
...yet it's barely been a month.

06:24.280 --> 06:25.861
He'll be home again soon.

06:30.680 --> 06:32.659
Won't he?

06:40.520 --> 06:44.297
My most be/o vea’ wife, Carol/he;
I write with some (“rep/damn.

06:45.360 --> 06:49.057
The French ﬂeet has been sighted not far from
our present position in the Channel.

06:49.240 --> 06:52.141
Though it is imposSIh/e to know
how soon we must engage with them,

06:52.320 --> 06:54.299
yet we know that attack is ine vitab/e.

06:55.080 --> 06:59.267
I beg you wiﬂ not distress yourse/Ij
for] have conﬁdence that we wﬂ/preva/Z

06:59.440 --> 07:02.420
that] wﬂi soon return home to you, my love.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.739
When will you announce your marriage?

07:05.640 --> 07:08.302
I've been thinking
it might seem disrespectful to Uncle Ray

07:08.480 --> 07:10.983
if it were known I'd married Dwight in secret.

07:11.720 --> 07:15.383
So, when he returns,
perhaps a small visit to the church.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.225
Where there will seem to be a wedding.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.743
Followed by a lavish celebration at Killewarren.

07:21.920 --> 07:24.377
- And no-One'll be any the wiser.
- (Ross chuckles)

07:24.560 --> 07:28.382
CAROLINE: It's the seemly thing to do,
out of respect for Uncle Ray.

07:29.120 --> 07:32.180
BASSE'I'I': Ray Penvenen's death
has been a great loss to the county.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.059
He was a gentleman of the first degree.

07:37.760 --> 07:41.423
Possessed a common touch, lived a simple life.

07:41.600 --> 07:46.469
We of less exalted _stock
would do well to follow hIs example.

07:48.280 --> 07:53.547
And yet you yourself have risen far, Sir Francis,

07:53.720 --> 07:56.302
- in wealth and status.
- As have you.

07:59.280 --> 08:03.501
Do you believe that we who have acquired
the privileges of wealth

08:03.680 --> 08:06.422
should enjoy superiority in all matters?

08:07.480 --> 08:14.101
I feel that power should always be in the hands
of those who know what to do with it.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.587
And justice?

08:16.760 --> 08:20.184
Superiority of intellect
will always ensure that justice is done...

08:21.120 --> 08:24.100
...as Ray Penvenen proved
when he served as Magistrate.

08:24.280 --> 08:26.066
Yes.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.026
However shall we replace him?

08:30.000 --> 08:32.457
I'm having a small gathering here next week.

08:32.640 --> 08:36.747
Perhaps you'd favour me with your company
and that of your charming wife?

08:37.960 --> 08:39.587
We'd be delighted.

08:48.080 --> 08:51.425
DRAKE: Do 'ee never go to church, sister?
- Once a year on Christmas Day.

08:52.480 --> 08:55.142
The rest of the year,
I try and behave like a good Christian.

08:55.320 --> 08:57.220
By avoiding sin?

08:57.400 --> 08:59.618
See, I'm not that convinced about sin, brother.

09:00.360 --> 09:05.627
I think more highly of love, my husband,
my child, my dog, my home.

09:05.800 --> 09:09.782
Those matter more to_ me than
a man sat on a throne In Heaven.

09:09.960 --> 09:14.147
But, sister, if you love Him first,
then all the rest will follow.

09:14.320 --> 09:19.303
I don't think I want it to follow, Drake.
I think I want it just as it is.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.219
Oh, well, I promised I'd try.

09:23.960 --> 09:25.302
What?

09:25.480 --> 09:27.903
He's set you on to try and convert me?

09:28.080 --> 09:30.719
He thinks you've more a taking for me
than for him.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.419
I have a taking for you both.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.219
And you've a beguiling way, Drake Came.

09:40.400 --> 09:43.142
I tremble for the young maids hereabouts.

09:44.440 --> 09:45.782
(Both laugh)

09:47.920 --> 09:49.387
(Elizabeth clears her throat)

09:49.560 --> 09:51.380
Is that a comical book, Morwenna?

09:51.560 --> 09:55.701
No, cousin. I believe it's the same one
you used to teach from.

09:55.880 --> 09:58.144
I don't recall it being so amusing.

09:58.320 --> 09:59.821
It never used to seem so.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.979
(Valentine cries)

10:09.800 --> 10:11.427
(Laughter resumes)

10:11.600 --> 10:13.147
(Stifled laughter)

10:15.920 --> 10:17.626
(Blows thudding)

10:18.720 --> 10:20.108
(Shouﬁng)

10:20.280 --> 10:21.861
Get away from here.

10:22.040 --> 10:23.905
- That's it.
- Go on, lad!

10:24.080 --> 10:25.661
(Shouﬁng)

10:26.720 --> 10:28.984
- What's amiss?
- An old friend of yours.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.617
Not been seen in these parts
since your father died.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.017
Tholly!

10:36.280 --> 10:38.419
Is it thee, young Cap'n?

10:38.600 --> 10:40.181
Ooh!

10:47.480 --> 10:48.742
(Groans)

10:48.920 --> 10:50.899
(Moans)

10:56.160 --> 10:58.219
(Chuckles) Well!

10:58.400 --> 11:00.027
(Coughs)

11:00.200 --> 11:01.827
(Splutters)

11:07.040 --> 11:08.780
- (Laughs)
- Tholly Tregirls.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.520
- I thought you were dead.
- Ah!

11:11.680 --> 11:16.379
Been nigh it oft enough, young Cap'n,
but cheated it by a whisker.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.346
Or a hand. (Chuckles)

11:18.520 --> 11:22.661
- I see Ned remembered you.
- As do half the husbands and fathers in Sawle.

11:22.840 --> 11:25.946
Is it my fault maidens can't resist I?

11:27.120 --> 11:30.260
Where I've been these 13 years?
What's my trade?

11:30.440 --> 11:34.467
Well, some do klep me "pirate",
some free trader".

11:34.640 --> 11:36.107
And some less flattering names?

11:36.280 --> 11:38.180
Fixer, fetcher, that's what I calls it.

11:38.360 --> 11:40.942
- You wants it, I ferrets it out.
- At a cost.

11:41.120 --> 11:44.021
Which my father used to say
was more than guineas.

11:44.200 --> 11:47.021
It didn't stop him from joining
my adventures though, did it?

11:47.200 --> 11:50.101
- Nor thee, young Cap'n.
- Well, I shan't be joining any more.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.862
Never say that, son.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.420
See this little pouch?

11:55.600 --> 11:58.387
In it, I carry the bones of my hand.

11:58.800 --> 11:59.983
(Rattling)

12:00.160 --> 12:01.821
(Chuckles)

12:02.000 --> 12:03.945
Remind I how fragile is life.

12:05.320 --> 12:08.027
Like in France now. Terrible state.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.623
Bloodshed and riot, murder and mayhem.

12:11.680 --> 12:13.659
Live for the moment, say I...

12:14.720 --> 12:17.462
...and be damned to the consequence.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.219
It's in the blood, son.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.027
Adventuring.

12:24.200 --> 12:27.340
Old Joshua could never resist.

12:28.160 --> 12:32.665
And I've suspicion t'will not be long afore
we'll be off on a jaunt again.

12:35.320 --> 12:36.901
(Softly) Not if I can help it.

12:38.880 --> 12:42.179
Sir Francis did not explicitly offer me
the position of Magistrate...

12:42.360 --> 12:45.818
- But you expect him to?
- On Monday, when we attend his gathering.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.821
I'll need robes, of course.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.342
A suitable wig.

12:50.520 --> 12:54.502
But I can see myself on the bench,
dispensing justice.

12:54.680 --> 12:57.740
I seem to recall Francis thought it
remarkably tedious.

12:57.920 --> 12:59.581
Francis took its benefits for granted.

12:59.760 --> 13:02.740
- I see it as a means to an end.
- Which is?

13:02.920 --> 13:08.222
To ensure that my son and heir
does not have to fight for his place in society.

13:11.360 --> 13:14.227
Francis and I used to play here
when we were boys.

13:16.480 --> 13:19.938
Perhaps Geoffrey Charles will do the same...
with Valentine.

13:22.280 --> 13:24.145
- You fear for him?
- Who?

13:24.320 --> 13:26.185
Geoffrey Charles.

13:26.360 --> 13:29.022
Left to the tender mercies of George,
how can I not?

13:30.360 --> 13:32.021
He was right.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.384
Now he has a son, everything will change.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.539
Not for us.

13:37.480 --> 13:41.064
Let us keep our distance and all will be well.

14:09.400 --> 14:10.867
Little Verity.

14:11.040 --> 14:13.702
Oh, Aunt, I'm so glad to see you.

14:13.880 --> 14:15.745
Comely little mite.

14:15.920 --> 14:18.980
- Take off after his father, do 'ee?
- I like to think so.

14:19.160 --> 14:23.540
Verity. So good of you to come.
We're quite the family gathering.

14:23.720 --> 14:25.187
Are Ross and Demelza here?

14:25.360 --> 14:28.864
- Oh, no, that
/s...
- They don't count as family now.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.387
Ross and George still have their differences.

14:32.560 --> 14:35.586
But what a cherub he is.

14:35.760 --> 14:39.309
Oh, and image of his papa.

14:39.480 --> 14:40.947
And Valentine, who does he favour?

14:41.120 --> 14:43.827
Aw! Shall we go inside?

14:45.360 --> 14:47.863
Let's see what's inside. (Chuckles)

15:04.360 --> 15:06.339
(Whinnyiflg)

15:15.080 --> 15:18.379
Lord have mercy on that poor Valentine,
christened this day a Warleggan.

15:21.160 --> 15:23.185
Little tacker giving you grief, is he?

15:24.360 --> 15:26.339
Who says it's a he?

15:32.120 --> 15:34.907
A crossbeam from a ship.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.627
There'll be many such timbers
before the war is over.

15:38.800 --> 15:42.304
Thank you, brother.
'Twill be just the thing to bolster the roof.

15:42.480 --> 15:45.301
And we shall pray for
the souls of those who perished.

15:45.480 --> 15:47.266
Which I daresay 'ee object to,

15:47.440 --> 15:50.500
since 'ee did bestow the cottage as a dwelling,
not a meeting house.

15:50.680 --> 15:54.980
I couldn't care less what you use it for, as long
as you don't stir up unrest in the village.

15:56.040 --> 15:59.498
We've had enough in recent years.
We're looking for a little peace.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.937
In the Lord shall ye find it.

16:03.120 --> 16:08.660
In truth, Sam's flock have so swelled already,
we must look out a larger house of worship.

16:10.320 --> 16:11.901
Preferably not on my land.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.779
(50th grunt)

16:21.200 --> 16:23.782
Valentine George, I baptise thee

16:23.960 --> 16:26.747
in the name of the Father and of the Son...

16:28.360 --> 16:30.544
...and of the Holy Ghost.

16:32.520 --> 16:33.908
(Bells pealing)

16:43.440 --> 16:46.819
Verity'll be there and Caroline...

16:47.880 --> 16:49.859
...at the christening.

16:59.280 --> 17:00.907
(Bells continue pealing)

17:02.160 --> 17:05.425
Yes, my son was most eager
to make his entrance into the world.

17:05.600 --> 17:07.977
- (Valentine cries)
- Already he's dictating terms.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.344
- His father's son.
- A true Warleggan.

17:11.400 --> 17:14.267
It's been a while since
you graced our humble house of prayer.

17:14.440 --> 17:16.624
- Do you find it much changed?
- In what regard?

17:16.800 --> 17:21.703
The roof no longer leaks, the west window
is repaired, new candlesticks adorn the altar.

17:21.880 --> 17:23.745
- Courtesy of yourself?
- Who else?

17:23.920 --> 17:28.107
As head of the premier family of the district,
I believe it's my duty to lead the way.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.617
Was this not lately the Poldark family church?

17:31.800 --> 17:34.064
George has a short memory.

17:37.080 --> 17:40.459
I wonder, brother,
whether this church might not suit us.

17:40.640 --> 17:43.985
They seem a goodly,
Christian set of folks hereabouts.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.067
Here you go.

17:51.240 --> 17:56.223
Dear Valentine. A robust little creature
and none the worse for coming a month early.

17:56.760 --> 17:59.581
- He's darker than his father.
- I think he favours his mother.

17:59.760 --> 18:01.307
(Coughs)

18:01.480 --> 18:04.142
And may we expect an announcement soon?

18:06.360 --> 18:08.737
’(our engagement to Lord Cowman’?

18:08.920 --> 18:14.142
Oh, no, I could not possibly consider it
so soon after my uncle's death.

18:14.320 --> 18:17.778
Do I understand that Dr Enys assisted
at Valentine's delivery?

18:17.960 --> 18:20.144
Mm, I'm sure we were much obliged to him.

18:20.320 --> 18:21.981
I assume he's now returned to the Navy.

18:22.160 --> 18:25.061
I believe he's in the Channel Patrol
with the Western Squadron.

18:25.240 --> 18:28.300
The Western? I trust they were not involved
in this latest skirmish.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.619
VERITY: Skirmish? We have not heard of any.

18:30.800 --> 18:34.463
Yes, we had it from one of our agents
in Falmouth, Ned Pellew's squadron, was it?

18:34.640 --> 18:37.586
Caught in a storm,
battled the French for over 12 hours.

18:37.760 --> 18:41.184
Three French ships lost, four of ours
and a merchant ship blown off course.

18:41.360 --> 18:43.737
- A merchant ship?
- Lost? You mean sunk?

18:44.800 --> 18:46.779
- As I understand it.
- Do you recall any names?

18:46.960 --> 18:49.986
Turmoil. Trident.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.822
GEORGE: As to the merchant ship, I've no idea.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.309
Please excuse us, Miss Penvenen is unwell.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.220
- Judas! Is it certain?
- Nothing's certain.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.300
I must send to Falmouth to the naval officers.

19:01.480 --> 19:04.040
As wife of Captain Blarney,
I'm well known in the town.

19:04.200 --> 19:08.625
- I hope someone can enlighten us.
- Ross is at the mine. Where's Prudie? Prudie?

19:09.680 --> 19:11.307
Prudie!

19:11.480 --> 19:13.266
(Panﬁng)

19:15.760 --> 19:18.740
The maid say you must get 'ee to Truro.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.939
(Whinnyiflg)

19:37.240 --> 19:38.628
(Grunts)

19:44.320 --> 19:46.185
This be the path,

19:46.360 --> 19:48.305
but now it goes across private land.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.620
Be this not the land
of which Cap'n Ross did speak?

19:53.240 --> 19:55.344
We must go round.

19:55.520 --> 19:59.297
'Twill add miles. My shoulder's fair cracking.

20:01.360 --> 20:03.021
I say we risk it.

20:05.760 --> 20:07.944
'Tis not as if we mean any harm.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.624
Lord, but christenings are dull!

20:28.160 --> 20:29.741
Thank heaven we escaped.

20:29.920 --> 20:31.899
Your mama may not be so pleased.

20:32.080 --> 20:33.741
Oh.

20:33.920 --> 20:35.262
Who's that?

20:35.440 --> 20:37.943
GEOFFREY CHARLES: This is private property!

20:41.360 --> 20:45.706
Sur,
we're just carrying this timber over to Sawle.

20:45.880 --> 20:48.440
'Tis some heavy
and we thought to take a shortcut.

20:48.600 --> 20:51.899
Perhaps you might assure young master...
Warleggan, is it?

20:52.080 --> 20:56.301
No, it is not. My name is Poldark
and this is Poldark land.

20:56.480 --> 21:01.702
Oh, 'tis you we seen by the path when
'ee did kindly direct us to my sister's house.

21:01.880 --> 21:03.620
Who's your sister?

21:03.800 --> 21:05.461
Demelza Poldark.

21:05.640 --> 21:07.426
That's my aunt.

21:07.880 --> 21:09.347
Does that mean we're related?

21:09.520 --> 21:11.420
Indirectly.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.465
I think we must be going.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.619
Your mama will wonder where we are.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.659
Mr Warleggan has men patrolling the grounds.

21:23.840 --> 21:26.502
If you make haste, you will avoid them.

21:26.680 --> 21:28.784
'Tis kind of 'ee, ma'am.

21:28.960 --> 21:30.541
We're much in your debt.

21:38.440 --> 21:42.319
I think, Geoffrey, it would be wise
to say nothing of meeting those young men.

21:42.480 --> 21:44.857
Your uncle is strict about trespass.

21:45.040 --> 21:47.099
We would not want to get them into trouble.

21:47.280 --> 21:49.737
Do you really think
they're related to Aunt Demelza?

21:49.920 --> 21:52.138
Seems unlikely. They seem very low-born.

21:53.360 --> 21:55.021
(Clears throat)

21:55.200 --> 21:59.421
You might have picked more
had you not wasted time talking to I,

21:59.600 --> 22:02.239
so I picked 'em for 'ee.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.379
(Approaching footsteps)

22:55.560 --> 22:59.860
A small token to celebrate this auspicious day...

23:01.440 --> 23:04.580
- ...which I trust will be the first of many.
- How thoughtful you are.

23:11.600 --> 23:16.822
I'm astonished at Verity, making off like that
and taking Caroline with her.

23:18.040 --> 23:20.019
What on earth could she mean?

23:23.800 --> 23:25.188
(Door closes)

23:28.000 --> 23:32.460
Truro yielded little news,
most of it vague and not to be relied upon.

23:32.640 --> 23:36.098
But there are rumours that
the merchant ship is the Esmeralda.

23:36.280 --> 23:38.987
- No.
- She appears to be missing.

23:39.160 --> 23:40.627
Oh, dear God.

23:40.800 --> 23:44.019
- And the Travail?
- Lost off the French coast.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.467
Oh, heavens!

23:46.640 --> 23:50.940
There's no way of knowing if any came ashore
or if she perished with all hands aboard.

23:51.120 --> 23:52.985
(Weeps)

23:54.840 --> 23:56.819
(SObs)

24:33.400 --> 24:35.459
I've looked for Tholly, but so far not a whisper.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.461
Mm. Typical.
Whenever he might be of use, he vanishes.

24:38.640 --> 24:41.700
Or doubtless he's found some credulous wench
to take him to bed.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.347
I'm not that sorry.

24:43.520 --> 24:46.466
Involvement with Tholly always comes at a price

24:46.640 --> 24:48.619
and I have my own connections.

24:49.640 --> 24:51.619
In the trade?

24:52.000 --> 24:54.343
I know I promised Demelza
my dealings there were over,

24:54.520 --> 24:58.627
but...this is for Dwight and my cousin Verity.

24:58.800 --> 25:01.109
So, we put the word out?

25:01.280 --> 25:03.145
All along the coast.

25:03.320 --> 25:05.902
Any who travel to the Scillies
and especially to France,

25:06.080 --> 25:07.866
tell them to keep their ear to the ground.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.827
Any rumour, chance remark...

25:11.000 --> 25:16.222
There again, we could always look to the power
of prayer to guide our search on this holy day.

25:18.800 --> 25:20.700
Hm.

25:20.880 --> 25:22.859
(Bell tolls)

25:35.400 --> 25:37.379
(indistinct chatter)

25:39.200 --> 25:41.020
(Chatter quietens)

25:49.440 --> 25:50.828
(Both giggle)

26:03.800 --> 26:05.984
'Tis now past the hour, sur.

26:06.440 --> 26:09.102
Our service begins when Mr Warleggan arrives.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.146
Warleggan?

26:14.200 --> 26:18.466
Then, let us while away the time
by praising the Lord in song.

26:22.160 --> 26:24.469
Has little Verity abandoned us?

26:24.640 --> 26:27.143
She sent for the baby
and said she'd return soon.

26:28.200 --> 26:31.784
Perhaps she finds her Nampara cousins
more congenial.

26:33.880 --> 26:36.337
George, are you ready?

26:36.520 --> 26:38.977
I dislike to keep the congregation waiting.

26:39.160 --> 26:41.264
Francis was never late...

26:42.560 --> 26:48.260
...but Francis did not assume Sunday worship
was conducted purely for his benefit.

26:55.800 --> 27:00.863
A pledge of liberty

27:01.040 --> 27:07.263
I find Him lifting up my head

27:07.440 --> 27:13.060
He brings salvation near

27:13.920 --> 27:16.229
His presence

27:16.400 --> 27:20.097
Makes me free indeed

27:20.280 --> 27:25.661
And He will soon appear

27:25.840 --> 27:27.705
Jesus, I hang...
- I can only apologise.

27:27.880 --> 27:31.304
Certain new members of our congregation
took matters into their own hands.

27:31.480 --> 27:33.220
..upon Thy word

27:33.400 --> 27:38.417
I steadfastly believe

27:38.600 --> 27:41.387
Thou wilt return

27:41.560 --> 27:45.508
And claim me, Lord

27:51.760 --> 27:53.739
ZACKY: Rumours aplenty, none of them good.

27:54.800 --> 27:58.224
A guinea for anyone with solid information.

27:59.240 --> 28:00.901
Eye-witnesses, names...

28:01.080 --> 28:03.059
You know where to find me.

28:06.800 --> 28:09.780
I think I must return to Killewarren.
There's little I can do here

28:09.960 --> 28:12.224
and Ross will bring me news
the minute he has any.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.379
Then I shall return to Trenwith.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.897
Elizabeth must think me unconscionably rude.

28:18.080 --> 28:21.379
The last thing we need is
more discord between our two houses.

28:22.480 --> 28:24.300
(indistinct chatter)

28:38.480 --> 28:40.459
God's grace go with 'ee, sur.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.345
The insolence of the man.

28:53.520 --> 28:55.385
That's Methodists for you.

28:55.560 --> 28:58.302
It disquiets me to see how
they set themselves apart,

28:58.480 --> 29:01.938
- as if thinking themselves superior.
- I must humbly agree, sir.

29:02.120 --> 29:07.262
In which case, can I suggest
you deal with them in an appropriate way?

29:07.440 --> 29:09.146
(Knocking on door)

29:16.000 --> 29:18.742
- (Door opens)
- Reverend Odgers. Come in.

29:24.520 --> 29:27.626
ROSS: That's all we need.
More conflict with George.

29:27.800 --> 29:33.067
But how dare Odgers forbid
decent, God-fearing Christians his church?

29:33.240 --> 29:37.427
Yet, with respect, brother, the Lord will surely
have some purpose in these ructions.

29:37.600 --> 29:40.979
I don't require the Lord's intervention
in my affairs, nor yours.

29:41.160 --> 29:42.627
Now, if you'll excuse me,

29:42.800 --> 29:46.907
the Lord has seen fit to consign
hundreds of souls to the bottom of the sea

29:47.080 --> 29:50.345
and I must try and discover if
my friends are amongst them.

30:11.920 --> 30:13.785
No news is better than ill news.

30:13.960 --> 30:16.383
Ross promised to send word
as soon as he had it.

30:16.560 --> 30:18.619
You may be sure he'll keep his word.

30:19.640 --> 30:21.505
'Tis the Poldark way.

30:21.680 --> 30:26.299
My clear, this feud between Ross and George,
can you find no way to end it?

30:26.480 --> 30:28.266
You were once a Poldark yourself.

30:30.720 --> 30:33.621
When you married Andrew,
against the wishes of your family,

30:33.800 --> 30:36.439
did you not vow to take his part in all things?

30:36.600 --> 30:38.067
Yes, of course, but...

30:38.240 --> 30:40.583
Well, I vowed likewise.

30:40.760 --> 30:44.639
I am Warleggan now
and must take my husband's part.

30:44.800 --> 30:47.701
- Even against Ross?
- Especially against Ross?

30:52.520 --> 30:53.703
(Door opens)

30:56.000 --> 30:57.342
Well?

30:57.520 --> 31:01.069
The Esmeralda seems to have disappeared
off the face of the earth.

31:01.240 --> 31:03.219
And the Travail?

31:05.640 --> 31:08.620
There was a ship smashed upon rocks.

31:09.680 --> 31:13.502
A handful of men came ashore,

31:13.680 --> 31:15.545
were met by a lawless rabble,

31:15.720 --> 31:17.984
rounded up, set upon.

31:19.160 --> 31:21.025
Where they were taken, God knows.

31:21.200 --> 31:23.760
Or indeed, if the ship was the Travail.

31:23.920 --> 31:25.899
And if it were...

31:26.960 --> 31:29.099
...how can we know if Dwight survived?

31:30.160 --> 31:32.139
We can't...

31:34.040 --> 31:35.621
...at this distance.

31:37.800 --> 31:41.941
Ross, you would not venture to France now,
in the midst of riot and bloodshed?

31:42.120 --> 31:43.985
How would you even get there?

31:44.160 --> 31:47.027
What would you have me do?
Abandon Dwight to his fate?

31:47.200 --> 31:50.180
No, but at least not be in such haste.

31:58.120 --> 31:59.542
As you wish.

32:00.240 --> 32:01.821
You agree?

32:03.640 --> 32:04.777
Why?

32:06.200 --> 32:09.784
We have an invitation from Sir Francis Basset.

32:09.960 --> 32:12.827
- Who's he?
- What George aspires to be.

32:13.000 --> 32:18.120
His family came from nothing, yet his wealth and
status now dwarf everyone else in the county.

32:18.280 --> 32:21.067
- Why would he invite us?
- No idea.

32:22.200 --> 32:24.384
Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't go...

32:26.120 --> 32:29.146
...especially as George and Elizabeth
will likely be there.

32:29.640 --> 32:32.063
But I'm told he has several
French nobles staying with him.

32:32.240 --> 32:35.027
- If they're lately from France...
- Might they have news of Dwight?

32:35.200 --> 32:39.785
Hardly. But the Travail, of its fate, who knows?

32:40.520 --> 32:43.421
So you won't go to France
before you speak with them?

32:44.720 --> 32:46.301
I won't go to France before that.

33:25.440 --> 33:27.419
(Cries)

33:35.080 --> 33:38.584
Forgive me, I heard crying
and thought Valentine was in distress.

33:38.760 --> 33:40.819
Yes, he often seems so.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.945
(Crying continues)

33:43.120 --> 33:45.099
Will you not pick him up?

33:47.000 --> 33:49.582
And have him think
he may always have hIS own way?

33:50.520 --> 33:53.341
- Geoffrey Charles never cried.
- Because you never left him to.

33:53.520 --> 33:57.183
All children are different.
If you have another, you'll realise that.

34:01.880 --> 34:03.507
Forgive me.

34:03.680 --> 34:06.342
I hope and pray you will have the chance.

34:09.640 --> 34:13.098
And that the child is as gentle
and amiable as Geoffrey Charles.

34:13.280 --> 34:16.340
Now, let us not be late for Sir Francis.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.306
(Cries)

34:19.360 --> 34:22.864
(Chuckles) This is the best beach in the world.

34:23.840 --> 34:26.400
And it belongs to my Uncle Ross.

34:26.560 --> 34:28.221
Oh!

34:28.400 --> 34:32.302
Then, should we really be venturing,
given the disagreement between your families?

34:32.480 --> 34:34.619
It's no disagreement of mine.

34:34.800 --> 34:37.940
Oh, but look! Is that not Aunt Demelza's brother?

34:38.120 --> 34:40.065
Master Geoffrey!

34:40.240 --> 34:42.219
Miss Morwenna!

34:43.000 --> 34:44.740
Proper waves, these, eh?

34:46.400 --> 34:50.302
Oh, 'twill not be new to you, young master,
but to I, the discoveries I've made!

34:51.360 --> 34:54.147
Course you'll know all about the Holy Well...

34:54.320 --> 34:56.265
No. What is it?

34:56.440 --> 35:00.820
'Tis a hollow in the rocks by the sea,
but the water's pure and sweet,

35:01.000 --> 35:04.549
on account of it was consecrated
a thousand year gone by Saint Sawle himself.

35:06.600 --> 35:08.977
Would 'ee care to see it?

35:09.160 --> 35:13.108
- Oh, no, I don't...l don't believe we...
- Of course she would.

35:16.440 --> 35:18.499
Lead on!

35:45.920 --> 35:47.547
ROSS: Far outshines Trenwith.

35:47.720 --> 35:49.460
Or Killewarren.

35:49.640 --> 35:51.505
And anything else in these parts.

35:51.680 --> 35:54.240
Was it not built on the proceeds of their mines?

35:54.400 --> 35:58.461
DEMELZA: Think of that, Ross,
if the lode did continue at Grace...

35:58.640 --> 36:01.620
In ten years,
I might be able to build us a small outhouse.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.379
(Classical music)

36:52.200 --> 36:53.667
We know our mission?

36:53.840 --> 36:57.344
Get news of the Travail and Esmeralda,
by any means necessary.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.739
(Water droplets splashing)

37:44.360 --> 37:45.941
'Tis sweet. Taste it!

37:54.080 --> 37:55.707
So it is.

38:04.040 --> 38:06.304
'Tis a wishin' well too, they say.

38:06.480 --> 38:09.267
What you do is, dip your right hand in the water,

38:09.440 --> 38:13.627
saying "Father, Son and Holy Spirit,"
and then your wish is granted.

38:13.800 --> 38:17.179
- That's sacrilege.
- 'Tisn't, though, begging your pardon.

38:17.360 --> 38:20.340
This be a holy place as much as any church.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.586
I suppose so.

38:25.280 --> 38:27.259
I'll go first.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.265
Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

38:43.600 --> 38:46.979
Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

38:49.320 --> 38:51.697
Now you, Miss Morwenna.

38:57.880 --> 39:02.101
(Whispers) Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

39:14.040 --> 39:18.386
I'm not sure St Sawle would approve of us,
making our frivolous wishes at his well.

39:19.640 --> 39:21.824
Mine wasn't frivolous.

39:23.160 --> 39:24.946
Nor mine.

39:26.800 --> 39:28.779
Nor mine.

39:32.400 --> 39:35.506
I must take Geoffrey home.
We've been gone for hours.

39:35.680 --> 39:37.261
Race me!

39:39.080 --> 39:40.661
Miss Morwenna.

39:47.760 --> 39:49.739
Just something I made.

39:59.440 --> 40:01.658
(Classical music continues)

40:02.720 --> 40:04.585
(Chatter)

40:10.280 --> 40:14.057
Sir Francis, may I introduce my wife Demelza?

40:14.240 --> 40:17.141
Is it you we have to thank for
your husband's presence here today?

40:17.320 --> 40:20.187
- He generally shuns society.
- I had much ado to persuade him.

40:20.360 --> 40:23.147
(Chuckles)
Do you not think we should stick together?

40:23.320 --> 40:25.902
After all, between us,
we provide work for much of the county.

40:26.080 --> 40:28.298
I wouldn't presume to compare
my enterprise with yours.

40:28.480 --> 40:30.107
But I trust we have things in common.

40:30.280 --> 40:33.909
_ _ A_concern for the conditions
In which mIners work, a WIsh to Improve them.

40:34.080 --> 40:36.867
Have a care, or you'll be called a Jacobin.

40:37.040 --> 40:39.383
Like yourself? (Chuckles)

40:40.160 --> 40:42.469
In truth, I'm no friend of revolution.

40:42.640 --> 40:47.225
To be governed by the mob is
to see the end of civil and religious liberties.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.180
As those gentlemen would tell you.

40:51.240 --> 40:54.061
- They've escaped from France?
- Within an inch of their lives.

40:55.400 --> 40:59.905
Terror and bloodshed,
that is not democracy, that is vengeance.

41:01.680 --> 41:05.946
And where it stalks, no-one is safe.
Let me introduce you.

41:10.920 --> 41:12.899
Ah, there is Sir Francis.

41:13.080 --> 41:15.640
Of course, it does not do to seem too eager.

41:16.680 --> 41:19.183
I can't imagine why Ross is here.

41:19.360 --> 41:21.624
The Poldarks and Bassets
have a long acquaIntance.

41:21.800 --> 41:24.382
The connection goes back generations.

41:25.840 --> 41:29.583
Of course, Sir Francis welcomes newer families,

41:36.280 --> 41:38.100
I must go and speak to Lady Whitworth.

41:41.440 --> 41:44.785
Drake's very common, isn't he?

41:44.960 --> 41:47.463
If by that you mean he's very low-born...

41:47.640 --> 41:49.619
Oh, I don't care that he is.

41:49.800 --> 41:53.429
To my mind, he has more wit and humour
than many of our class.

41:53.600 --> 41:56.103
I would not let your Uncle George
hear you say that.

41:56.280 --> 41:59.181
In fact, I would not mention these visits at all.

41:59.360 --> 42:01.544
Perhaps we shouldn't come again.

42:02.480 --> 42:05.938
Morvvenna, it's the best beach in Cornwall.

42:06.120 --> 42:10.705
It is Poldark land and Drake's a Poldark relative.

42:12.200 --> 42:14.862
(Sighs) I don't think any good could come of it.

42:16.720 --> 42:18.540
(Classical music continues)

42:23.400 --> 42:25.743
Mistress Poldark...

42:25.920 --> 42:29.105
- Are you impressed with Tehidy?
- Who could not be?

42:29.280 --> 42:32.977
You don't find it too intimidating,
in its size and splendour?

42:33.160 --> 42:38.507
But, of course, these days you glide with ease
through all of society, from lowest to high.

42:38.680 --> 42:42.377
Why, only now,
I saw you conversing with our French amis.

42:43.440 --> 42:46.182
They were speaking of plans
for a landing in Brittany.

42:46.360 --> 42:49.227
- British-funded, no doubt.
- To raise the Royalist flag.

42:49.400 --> 42:53.177
- The Bretons suffer fearfully.
- You seem very well-informed.

42:53.360 --> 42:57.137
Well, I wonder what advantage
we might take of such a landing?

42:57.320 --> 43:00.027
We? As in the British Navy?

43:00.200 --> 43:04.546
As in we who have friends or relatives,
lost on French shores.

43:04.720 --> 43:06.426
Dr Enys, for instance?

43:06.600 --> 43:09.819
And if such a landing might be
a means of locating such as survived,

43:10.000 --> 43:14.380
- and if it did, of later freeing them.
- Interesting thought.

43:14.560 --> 43:16.425
Though entirely fanciful.

43:16.600 --> 43:22.106
If such a landing were to be managed,
its aim would surely be the liberation of France,

43:22.280 --> 43:24.942
not the rescue of some minor English officers.

43:25.120 --> 43:28.146
Reverend Halse,
do you know Captain Poldark's wife?

43:28.320 --> 43:30.379
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.

43:30.560 --> 43:35.782
'Tis fortunate this is a large house, sir, then you
and my husband may avoid each other.

43:41.600 --> 43:43.739
Shall we try our luck at faro?

43:43.920 --> 43:47.060
By all means, sir. I'll join directly.

43:50.960 --> 43:54.623
It will certainly be a hazardous venture,
but I wish you all success.

43:54.800 --> 43:57.667
- Merci, monsieur. Merci.
- Mr Poldark.

43:57.840 --> 43:59.501
Reverend Halse.

43:59.680 --> 44:02.979
I wonder if you would favour me
with a moment of your time?

44:07.160 --> 44:08.343
As you wish.

44:15.680 --> 44:17.944
Ray Penvenen is a great loss.

44:18.120 --> 44:23.387
A man of his breeding, good sense,
not easily replaced.

44:24.520 --> 44:27.023
- On the bench, I mean.
- I couldn't say.

44:27.200 --> 44:29.065
I never came before him.

44:29.240 --> 44:31.902
A man of integrity, conviction.

44:32.080 --> 44:35.857
In a Justice of the Peace,
that is what one seeks.

44:36.040 --> 44:38.622
And so often fails to find.

44:39.320 --> 44:41.880
Your cousin was a magistrate.
Your uncle before him.

44:42.040 --> 44:45.817
There's been a Poldark on the bench
for the last hundred years.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.582
Then, you'll be glad to see
I've broken with tradition.

44:49.760 --> 44:51.819
Sir Francis Basset is not glad.

44:52.000 --> 44:57.267
He's asked me to intervene. To invite you
to step up and follow in their footsteps.

44:57.440 --> 45:02.423
He and you must know it's barely four years
since I was on trial for wrecking, riot and assault.

45:02.600 --> 45:07.105
On which charges you were,
miraculously, acquitted.

45:07.280 --> 45:10.465
And two years before that,
I broke into Bodmin Jail and freed a prisoner.

45:10.640 --> 45:15.020
Or do you and your fellow-justices regard this
as "youthful exuberance"?

45:15.200 --> 45:21.218
It's possible we espouse the principle
that a reformed sinner makes the best parson.

45:22.440 --> 45:25.307
It's not simply in the matter of justice
that one wields power.

45:25.480 --> 45:29.905
As a magistrate,
one has a say in the setting of rates, taxes,

45:30.080 --> 45:32.264
the use to which they are put.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.879
One's influence in many spheres
is considerable.

45:38.680 --> 45:41.262
Then I'd be required to judge my fellow men.

45:42.520 --> 45:44.499
Naturally.

45:46.720 --> 45:48.460
Therein lies the problem.

45:48.640 --> 45:54.499
You should be aware that, if you decline
this role, it will be offered elsewhere...

45:55.560 --> 45:58.540
Nevertheless, I do decline.

45:58.720 --> 46:00.904
...to Mr George Warleggan.

46:08.040 --> 46:10.019
An admirable choice.

46:11.600 --> 46:13.545
George has all the qualities I lack.

46:13.720 --> 46:16.359
And lacks many of the qualities you have.

46:36.480 --> 46:38.027
Do not lose heart.

46:38.200 --> 46:40.862
- I'm sure he's safe.
- Then, why have we not had word?

46:41.880 --> 46:43.347
I must prepare myself.

46:43.520 --> 46:46.023
- Verity...
- My dear, do not pity me.

46:46.200 --> 46:48.065
Pity Caroline.

46:48.240 --> 46:52.665
Her life with Dwight has barely begun
and I've had six years of happiness.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.343
I have our beloved child.

46:56.520 --> 46:58.704
I never expected such joy...

46:59.760 --> 47:02.137
...and if all is now lost... (Sniffs)

47:02.960 --> 47:05.064
I'll be forever grateful I had it so long.

47:06.240 --> 47:08.697
- You're too good.
- I'm not.

47:09.680 --> 47:11.102
I'm like you.

47:11.640 --> 47:15.383
You've learnt to make the best_and _
to be grateful for whatever you have In your lIfe.

47:29.800 --> 47:31.540
Even Elizabeth and George?

47:32.320 --> 47:33.742
I confess, that disquiets me.

47:33.920 --> 47:38.539
The Poldarks are quick to anger
and slow to forgive, but you...

47:38.720 --> 47:42.224
Have you become so like Ross
that you can no longer let go ill-will?

47:42.400 --> 47:47.747
Here we are, in the same room,
bound by ties of blood, yet unable to meet.

47:47.920 --> 47:50.138
Will you not let me bring you together?

47:50.320 --> 47:53.904
- 'Tis impossible.
- Why? What is the cause of this present feud?

47:54.080 --> 47:57.345
- My dear, your husband's ship, the Esmeralda...
- Yes?

47:57.520 --> 47:59.545
Captain Trevose has had word
from the Admiralty.

47:59.720 --> 48:04.339
She put into port in Lisbon two days ago,
weather-beaten but unharmed.

48:10.920 --> 48:12.501
(indistinct chatter)

48:12.680 --> 48:14.659
I must go to Lisbon.

48:15.360 --> 48:17.999
Most excellent news. I'm very glad.

48:19.960 --> 48:21.541
You refused the offer?

48:22.320 --> 48:23.901
'Twas a mistake.

48:24.080 --> 48:26.787
As Magistrate,
you could've done so much good.

48:26.960 --> 48:29.417
Common folk did need someone on their side.

48:29.600 --> 48:34.139
I wouldn't be permitted to be "on their side,"
I'd be obliged to be "fair.

48:34.320 --> 48:39.257
And would you not use your power wisely,
with justice and mercy, for all the right reasons?

48:39.440 --> 48:41.704
Unlike someone we know?

48:46.360 --> 48:48.339
(Softly) Yes.

49:02.600 --> 49:04.739
Did you glean anything from the Frenchmen?

49:04.920 --> 49:06.979
Nothing I didn't already know.

49:16.400 --> 49:17.537
(Whip cracks)

49:17.720 --> 49:19.506
(Whinnyiflg)

49:25.920 --> 49:27.660
ROSS: I didn't wish to distress Caroline,

49:27.840 --> 49:30.707
but the Comte de Sombreuil thinks
we should prepare for the worst.

49:30.880 --> 49:34.429
- Why?
- If there were survivors, there'd be names, lists,

49:34.600 --> 49:37.262
posted about the streets,
to boast of their capture.

49:38.520 --> 49:40.579
There are no lists.

49:41.840 --> 49:44.149
So no-one survived?

49:47.080 --> 49:50.823
Justice of the Peace. (Chuckles)

49:51.000 --> 49:53.025
The first Warleggan to be called to the bench.

49:56.640 --> 49:58.028
Are you not impressed?

49:59.920 --> 50:02.787
After all, what other candidate could there be?

50:02.960 --> 50:04.905
Ross?

50:06.040 --> 50:07.462
Ross?

50:09.040 --> 50:10.667
The obvious choice.

50:10.840 --> 50:12.580
And yet he was not offered it.

50:13.640 --> 50:16.017
Perhaps he was.

50:25.960 --> 50:27.939
(Gulls cry)

50:32.440 --> 50:36.740
Lisbon awaits us, sweetheart,
and Papa will be waiting for us.

50:41.520 --> 50:44.705
If we close our eyes,
we can imagine we're already there.

50:52.600 --> 50:54.579
(Both laugh)

51:11.480 --> 51:13.789
Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

51:16.680 --> 51:18.944
Morwenna.

51:42.360 --> 51:44.737
There is some consolation.

51:46.960 --> 51:49.099
I knew if it existed, you'd find it.

51:49.280 --> 51:53.785
Andrew is safe
and Verity will soon join him in Lisbon...

51:54.840 --> 51:56.341
...and Sam and Drake have settled.

51:57.160 --> 52:00.744
And we left Tehidy
without bad words 'twixt you and George.

52:02.560 --> 52:05.825
So perhaps we can hope for
a little peace in our lives.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.979
Peace, yes.

52:09.040 --> 52:11.065
I like the sound of that.

52:11.840 --> 52:13.819
(Knocking on door)

52:15.240 --> 52:17.026
(Knocking continues)

52:18.080 --> 52:19.866
(Groans)

52:24.320 --> 52:27.869
A guinea was the sum, I bela'?

52:28.720 --> 52:31.280
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

52:31.440 --> 52:34.386
The Travail ran aground
near a place called Quimper.

52:34.560 --> 52:37.700
An old convent turned into a prison.
Hundreds of prisoners are there.

52:37.880 --> 52:39.700
- Could Dwight be there?
- If he survived.

52:39.880 --> 52:42.303
An old friend of my father
has contacts in France.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.422
Smuggling contacts.

52:47.160 --> 52:50.744
There's a merchant in Roscoff,
a man called Clisson.

52:51.480 --> 52:56.497
He's known in the town and would be willing
to seek out information...f0r a price.

52:58.520 --> 53:00.499
And so?

53:02.680 --> 53:04.989
I think I must go.

53:21.600 --> 53:22.988
Little Verity.

53:23.160 --> 53:26.027
Will I ever see you again?

53:26.720 --> 53:29.587
You shall, dear Aunt, I promise you.

53:43.160 --> 53:45.139
(Whip cracks)

54:10.000 --> 54:11.979
Where are you, my love?

54:15.400 --> 54:17.379
Where are you?

54:36.720 --> 54:38.460
Un...

54:39.440 --> 54:42.659
...deux...trois!

54:54.040 --> 54:55.507
Arrte!

54:58.440 --> 55:00.180
Lve-toi maintenant!

55:03.280 --> 55:05.339
Lve-toi! J'ai dis lve-toi!

55:06.040 --> 55:07.621
(French officer shouts)

55:20.400 --> 55:24.587
Be ready and heave!

55:26.160 --> 55:27.707
Heave!

55:28.640 --> 55:31.620
(Tholly calls out)

55:32.960 --> 55:34.939
Heave!

55:36.320 --> 55:37.901
(Calls out)

55:41.160 --> 55:43.060
(Exhales deeply)

55:43.800 --> 55:48.021
See, I telled 'ee, young Cap'n,
we'd soon be off on anotherjaunt!

55:53.840 --> 55:55.819
Ready.

56:02.040 --> 56:05.020
Wait...for the Cap'n!

Ready!

56:07.560 --> 56:10.540
And heave!
