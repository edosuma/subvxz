WEBVTT

00:16.992 --> 00:18.992
Previously on APB...

00:19.017 --> 00:20.430
See that guy in the red flannel?

00:20.480 --> 00:23.211
That's Andre Coates, leader
of the Green Street Kings.

00:23.236 --> 00:25.083
End of the day, I got a bottom line.

00:25.118 --> 00:27.781
I can't let my people see me
taking and not giving it back.

00:27.806 --> 00:28.953
Ha, ha!

00:28.989 --> 00:30.976
Is this everything from my body-cam?

00:31.001 --> 00:32.531
It's pretty cool, right?

00:32.539 --> 00:34.834
Goss, I just got a call that I
need you and Brandt to check out...

00:34.859 --> 00:36.919
it's a hacker, goes by the name "DV8."

00:39.423 --> 00:40.917
I'm coming, Ada,

00:40.942 --> 00:42.237
and I'm going to destroy you

00:42.262 --> 00:44.612
and Gideon Reeves and
everyone in between.

00:44.637 --> 00:47.095
I have to quit this job
now. I can't explain it.

00:47.131 --> 00:48.997
Well, then I don't
accept your resignation.

00:49.033 --> 00:50.339
Ada?

01:01.886 --> 01:04.628
1309, we just heard from
a couple of ambo drivers

01:04.653 --> 01:05.853
in Garfield Park.

01:05.878 --> 01:08.550
They're in the middle of
treating a female assault victim,

01:08.575 --> 01:11.050
but according to them, the
beat-down is just beginning.

01:11.075 --> 01:12.174
Copy, squad.

01:12.199 --> 01:13.799
1309 responding.

01:23.993 --> 01:26.590
You didn't see nothing?
That's what you said?

01:26.615 --> 01:28.152
I found her like that.
It's the truth, man.

01:28.177 --> 01:29.910
Bitch, I know you lying.

01:30.269 --> 01:31.606
Nothing?

01:32.742 --> 01:34.542
Police! Back off now!

01:34.567 --> 01:37.167
Everybody move back now! Let him go!

01:38.983 --> 01:40.282
Andre?

01:40.307 --> 01:42.397
- What the hell's going on here?
- What's going on?

01:42.422 --> 01:43.888
A girl got raped in my hood.

01:43.913 --> 01:46.103
- And this guy?
- Lewis here found her.

01:46.128 --> 01:47.460
Now he acting like he ain't see nothing.

01:47.485 --> 01:49.574
- How is she?
- She's unconscious.

01:49.593 --> 01:50.780
Pulse is weak, but she's breathing.

01:50.805 --> 01:52.309
We're taking her to Mercy Hospital.

01:52.334 --> 01:53.981
Green Street take care of its own.

01:54.006 --> 01:56.085
Something like this
happens, I handle it.

01:56.110 --> 01:58.620
So you get your boys to beat
up some guy 'cause he found her?

01:58.645 --> 02:00.278
Malik, you beating up on somebody?

02:00.303 --> 02:02.356
Nah. We just talking.

02:02.381 --> 02:05.143
See? I'm just trying to
get a little information.

02:05.168 --> 02:06.685
Go home, Andre.

02:06.721 --> 02:08.496
This is my investigation now.

02:08.821 --> 02:10.503
We'll see about that.

02:18.490 --> 02:20.824
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font>
www.addic7ed.com

02:20.848 --> 02:22.848
In another day of
violence on the South Side,

02:22.873 --> 02:25.731
Chicago police departments
have called in off-duty officers

02:25.756 --> 02:27.213
for the second time this month.

02:27.238 --> 02:28.347
Multiple...

02:34.247 --> 02:35.454
Yes.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.198
So you don't return my calls?

02:37.223 --> 02:38.501
Yeah, I've been busy.

02:38.551 --> 02:39.925
Yeah? Doing what?

02:39.960 --> 02:42.612
Choosing between sour
cream and barbecue?

02:42.637 --> 02:44.862
Why don't you tell me
what is really going on,

02:44.887 --> 02:48.356
so I can figure out how to fix
it, bring you back to the 13th.

02:48.381 --> 02:50.591
Because you can't fix everything.

02:50.626 --> 02:54.194
Really? 'Cause I've actually fixed
an astonishing amount of things.

02:54.230 --> 02:55.887
- Just ask NASA.
- Oh, my God.

02:55.912 --> 02:57.507
Hey. Where'd we meet?

02:57.540 --> 03:00.242
That cozy holding cell in Cook County.

03:00.269 --> 03:02.484
If I can protect you from the FBI,

03:02.509 --> 03:04.259
don't you think I can
handle whatever this is?

03:04.284 --> 03:05.718
This is a personal thing, okay?

03:05.743 --> 03:07.641
So I have to just
deal with it on my own.

03:07.691 --> 03:08.991
No, you don't.

03:09.180 --> 03:11.111
'Cause I'm here... God.

03:12.727 --> 03:14.260
- I have to go.
- _

03:14.806 --> 03:17.251
This conversation is not over.

03:21.310 --> 03:22.923
Her name's Kayla Brawn.

03:22.948 --> 03:25.759
She just started her senior
year at Garfield Park High.

03:25.794 --> 03:27.935
She disappeared after the
neighborhood block party yesterday.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.229
I went to that school.

03:29.265 --> 03:31.029
Grew up two blocks from
where they found her.

03:31.054 --> 03:33.154
Well, that means you
grew up three blocks

03:33.179 --> 03:35.102
from where they found the other victim.

03:35.137 --> 03:37.538
This is not the first time
that this has happened.

03:37.573 --> 03:39.294
A month ago, they found a young woman,

03:39.319 --> 03:41.356
beaten and raped, in the same area.

03:41.381 --> 03:44.901
Are you telling me we have a
serial rapist in my district?

03:44.926 --> 03:46.426
Look at the ligature marks.

03:46.451 --> 03:48.317
It's the same as the ones on Kayla.

03:48.342 --> 03:49.441
Both markings came back

03:49.466 --> 03:51.051
as a match for some kind of...

03:51.086 --> 03:52.719
zip-tie around the girls' wrists.

03:52.755 --> 03:56.145
Unfortunately, serial
rapist sounds about right.

04:02.057 --> 04:03.423
What?

04:06.746 --> 04:09.102
Don't worry. Nothing
wrong's with your car.

04:09.135 --> 04:10.317
It's just me.

04:10.342 --> 04:12.411
Since you weren't
answering my phone calls,

04:12.436 --> 04:14.074
I found a back door
into your sound system.

04:14.109 --> 04:15.137
Danny!

04:15.162 --> 04:17.161
My name is DV8 now.

04:17.187 --> 04:19.178
And your name is clearly narc.

04:19.214 --> 04:21.125
Bet you're disappointed
you didn't get rid of me

04:21.151 --> 04:22.749
in that impromptu police raid.

04:22.785 --> 04:25.171
Taking a page out of Mein Kampf, I see.

04:25.196 --> 04:27.173
I was defending myself.

04:27.198 --> 04:29.500
No, you're defending
a corrupt police state

04:29.525 --> 04:31.563
run by that egomaniac you work for.

04:31.619 --> 04:34.353
Okay, well, thanks to you,
I don't work for him anymore,

04:34.388 --> 04:36.118
so we can just be done with this.

04:36.143 --> 04:38.152
No. It's too late for that.

04:38.177 --> 04:39.892
You know what happens
to people who fight

04:39.927 --> 04:41.394
for the wrong side, Ada?

04:49.387 --> 04:50.903
Open the door!

04:50.938 --> 04:52.885
You picked your friends.

04:52.910 --> 04:54.653
Now you've made your enemies.

05:15.961 --> 05:17.225
Gideon, we got a problem.

05:17.250 --> 05:18.998
Then I got solutions. Hit me.

05:19.033 --> 05:21.500
You remember Andre? Runs
the Green Street Kings?

05:21.536 --> 05:24.703
Chip on his shoulder and
dreads on his head. I do.

05:24.739 --> 05:26.005
We had a little run-in this morning,

05:26.030 --> 05:27.969
when I went out on the
call for the rape case.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.421
I thought he was just fronting,

05:29.446 --> 05:30.819
showing the neighborhood who's boss.

05:30.844 --> 05:33.212
Turns out, he's doing a full-on
investigation of his own.

05:33.247 --> 05:34.313
That's strange.

05:34.338 --> 05:36.482
I must have missed
Andre's academy graduation,

05:36.517 --> 05:38.051
'cause I'm pretty sure he's not a cop.

05:38.076 --> 05:39.770
Well, right now, we're
not getting anywhere

05:39.795 --> 05:42.333
unless we're talking
to Andre first. Look.

05:42.358 --> 05:45.559
So Pete's fed all the
information to the APB app.

05:45.584 --> 05:46.715
But in this whole area,

05:46.740 --> 05:48.774
only a couple people have downloaded it.

05:48.942 --> 05:51.163
I mean, I know some people
don't like technology,

05:51.199 --> 05:54.200
but you know what
everyone hates? Rapists.

05:54.235 --> 05:56.202
Seriously, that's a
well-documented fact.

05:56.237 --> 05:57.403
No doubt. But walking around

05:57.438 --> 05:58.938
with a crime-fighting app on your phone

05:58.973 --> 06:01.209
in an area that's dominated by gangs?

06:01.234 --> 06:02.667
It's not a great idea.

06:04.323 --> 06:05.811
Hey, 1312,

06:05.846 --> 06:07.425
how's it going out there?

06:10.073 --> 06:11.884
Do death stares count as intel?

06:11.919 --> 06:14.119
'Cause if that's the case,
I'm killing it out here.

06:14.144 --> 06:15.829
How about you, 1305?

06:16.155 --> 06:17.790
Oh, snap.

06:17.815 --> 06:19.291
Not too good, squad.

06:19.327 --> 06:20.993
We're getting iced out left and right.

06:21.028 --> 06:22.461
My ears are ringing from all the doors

06:22.496 --> 06:23.696
I've had slammed in my face.

06:23.721 --> 06:25.239
Yeah. Everybody we try to talk to

06:25.264 --> 06:27.333
has already talked to
the Green Street Kings.

06:27.693 --> 06:29.144
Hey, call me crazy,

06:29.169 --> 06:31.670
but I think that baby
banger is following us.

06:31.706 --> 06:33.083
Hey!

06:34.642 --> 06:36.508
We're just trying to do our job here.

06:36.544 --> 06:39.078
What you know, Andre knows.

06:39.113 --> 06:41.029
Green Street's got this.

06:44.388 --> 06:46.986
Every cop is running
into the same thing.

06:47.021 --> 06:49.855
Not to mention that Andre's boys
put two people in the hospital

06:49.880 --> 06:51.892
because he thought they were
holding out on information.

06:51.917 --> 06:54.445
All right, well, we still
have electronic surveillance.

06:54.470 --> 06:55.867
Right? We still got the drone.

06:55.892 --> 06:58.236
Well, actually, uh, about that...

06:58.833 --> 07:02.134
Turns out that the drone is not
that popular in Garfield Park.

07:02.169 --> 07:04.820
I've already had to
dodge half a dozen rocks,

07:04.845 --> 07:07.791
and one kid even took a swing
at it with a baseball bat.

07:07.816 --> 07:09.759
Whoa, whoa.

07:09.784 --> 07:10.809
What was that?

07:12.305 --> 07:13.611
Uh...

07:15.516 --> 07:17.745
That sounds like a .45 caliber message

07:17.770 --> 07:19.603
from the Green Street Kings.

07:19.638 --> 07:22.132
Well... guess we're gonna have to...

07:22.157 --> 07:24.259
send them a message of our own.

07:24.721 --> 07:26.553
Are you out of your minds?

07:26.588 --> 07:28.923
There's no way I'm bringing a
drug dealer in on a rape case.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.970
Well, the thing is, we have,

07:30.995 --> 07:34.719
what we call in engineering,
a single point of failure here.

07:34.744 --> 07:37.244
Which is why we're... you know, failing.

07:37.269 --> 07:38.501
Captain, you and I both know

07:38.526 --> 07:40.759
that the Green Street
Kings run those streets.

07:40.784 --> 07:42.216
We just need to talk to him.

07:42.241 --> 07:45.041
Which you know damn well
only gives Andre more power.

07:45.066 --> 07:46.650
Hell, he's already got his thugs dealing

07:46.675 --> 07:48.416
out of an abandoned police station.

07:48.463 --> 07:50.396
Every time we go to him,

07:50.432 --> 07:53.600
we send the message that Andre's
the one in charge, not us.

07:53.635 --> 07:56.583
Well, we don't want to
pin a badge on his chest.

07:56.608 --> 08:00.810
It's just about a temporary
strategic partnership.

08:00.835 --> 08:02.349
Cops and criminals.

08:02.374 --> 08:03.674
Natural born enemies, right?

08:03.699 --> 08:07.858
But when Steve Jobs almost
lost Apple in the '90s,

08:07.883 --> 08:09.808
you know who rode to his rescue?

08:09.833 --> 08:11.017
Bill Gates.

08:11.052 --> 08:14.270
This is a Chicago neighborhood
we're talking about, Gideon,

08:14.295 --> 08:16.222
not some fancy boardroom.

08:16.268 --> 08:18.835
Look, I got no problem
dealing with criminals

08:18.860 --> 08:20.989
when I think it can help
us solve a case faster.

08:21.014 --> 08:22.997
Hell, I deal with them every day!

08:23.022 --> 08:24.155
But Andre.

08:24.180 --> 08:26.180
Without Andre, we might not have a case.

08:26.205 --> 08:28.268
Look, I don't like this
idea any more than you do.

08:28.303 --> 08:30.803
But right now, Andre's
the best play that we have.

08:30.839 --> 08:32.705
We just want to have a conversation.

08:32.741 --> 08:36.643
No different than a billionaire
talking to a police captain.

08:37.458 --> 08:38.857
Except for the police captain part.

08:39.043 --> 08:40.876
Fine.

08:40.900 --> 08:42.301
Have a conversation.

08:42.517 --> 08:45.051
But I don't know what the
hell you'd even ask him for.

08:46.430 --> 08:48.273
I think I have an idea.

09:01.599 --> 09:03.356
Oh, y'all blazed before y'all got here.

09:03.381 --> 09:05.439
'Cause you must be high if
you think I'm helping you.

09:05.464 --> 09:08.402
Certainly getting a contact high.

09:08.895 --> 09:10.684
Andre, we're just asking for a favor.

09:10.709 --> 09:11.973
I'm handling this.

09:11.998 --> 09:13.715
Your boys knocked some guy's teeth out.

09:13.740 --> 09:15.006
You call that handling it?

09:15.029 --> 09:17.168
Cops got your way of
doing business, I got mine.

09:17.204 --> 09:19.335
Look, all we're asking is
that you convince your people

09:19.360 --> 09:20.855
to send us videos and
pictures of a block party.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.160
That way, I can stitch them together

09:22.185 --> 09:24.004
and maybe figure out
what happened to Kayla.

09:24.029 --> 09:26.723
Ain't nobody stupid enough
to send videos to the cops.

09:26.748 --> 09:28.410
Sorry, do I look like a cop to you?

09:28.435 --> 09:31.340
This is Dolce & Gabbana, not, uh,

09:31.621 --> 09:34.000
polyester-spandex, thank you very much.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.738
I'm a CEO like you.

09:35.763 --> 09:38.137
- Say what now?
- Oh, uh, you know, I'm...

09:38.162 --> 09:41.715
My business is more Gold Coast

09:41.740 --> 09:43.785
than Green Street, but
isn't protecting customers

09:43.810 --> 09:45.062
part of the job?

09:45.087 --> 09:46.920
If you work with us, we get this guy.

09:46.945 --> 09:50.566
If you don't, people
might start to turn on you.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.684
My Kings would never let that happen.

09:52.709 --> 09:54.285
I hope you're right,
I hope you're right.

09:54.310 --> 09:56.519
But you know, people
smell weakness, right?

09:56.544 --> 09:58.464
That's when the vultures come.

09:58.519 --> 09:59.785
Bottom line is:

09:59.820 --> 10:01.681
rapists are bad for your business.

10:01.706 --> 10:03.088
And we all know what happens

10:03.123 --> 10:05.090
when a CEO isn't getting the job done.

10:05.125 --> 10:07.826
He gets replaced by somebody that can.

10:07.861 --> 10:12.197
Now, with me, that's a
multimillion-dollar payout,

10:12.232 --> 10:13.632
retirement in the Maldives.

10:13.667 --> 10:17.269
In your world, I'm guessing
that, uh, "severance"

10:17.304 --> 10:18.704
takes on a very different meaning.

10:18.739 --> 10:21.340
You know how many times I
been dragged down to the 13th?

10:21.375 --> 10:23.508
Well, that was the old 13th.

10:23.613 --> 10:25.558
You're looking at the new one.

10:26.179 --> 10:29.258
One businessman to
another: don't blow this.

10:29.283 --> 10:31.817
This is the best call
that you could make

10:31.852 --> 10:34.089
for you and your neighborhood.

10:37.326 --> 10:39.305
I'll reach out to my people.

10:42.615 --> 10:44.102
Great.

10:52.451 --> 10:53.984
Professor Malkova.

10:54.009 --> 10:55.742
I wondered when I might be seeing you.

10:55.843 --> 10:57.109
Fancy a game?

10:57.144 --> 10:59.958
With you? Always.

11:02.513 --> 11:04.249
Heard about your troubles.

11:04.284 --> 11:06.778
Sounds like somebody's got bad blood

11:06.803 --> 11:08.420
with Danny Reghabi.

11:08.455 --> 11:10.622
Yeah, I hear he goes by DV8 now.

11:10.657 --> 11:12.253
Yeah, I know.

11:12.278 --> 11:14.459
But once a student, always a student.

11:14.495 --> 11:18.563
Word is he's very
angry with you, my dear.

11:18.599 --> 11:21.483
Tried to turn me into
road kill this morning.

11:21.668 --> 11:24.645
Any chance you want to help
me out, get him off my back?

11:24.670 --> 11:28.774
Danny's an unstable young man
with extreme political views.

11:28.998 --> 11:31.043
Not someone I want mad at me.

11:31.078 --> 11:33.412
Not even for your favorite student?

11:35.029 --> 11:38.255
We're not back in a
complexity theory class, Ada.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.963
This is the real world,
and it's dangerous.

11:40.988 --> 11:42.020
I know.

11:42.056 --> 11:44.396
He did try to kill me this morning.

11:45.411 --> 11:47.990
Come on, all I need is
a little information.

11:48.372 --> 11:50.862
I'm regretting this already, but...

11:50.898 --> 11:52.998
have you heard of a hacker collective

11:53.033 --> 11:55.099
by the name of CommandALT?

11:55.359 --> 11:58.083
- Yeah.
- I hear Danny's set up shop with them.

11:58.622 --> 12:00.247
CommandALT works out of the....

12:00.272 --> 12:02.706
old Peoria meatpacking plant.

12:02.763 --> 12:05.724
Get something they don't
want shared with the world.

12:06.747 --> 12:08.747
You might be able to use it to get Danny

12:08.772 --> 12:10.582
to keep his hands to himself.

12:10.617 --> 12:12.350
Really think that's gonna work?

12:12.386 --> 12:13.458
It might.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.717
Or, knowing Danny, it might not.

12:16.310 --> 12:19.231
Either way, be careful.

12:22.391 --> 12:24.329
- Okay.
- Aren't you gonna finish the game?

12:24.364 --> 12:25.836
I already did.

12:26.733 --> 12:28.329
Checkmate.

12:31.038 --> 12:32.671
Andre came through.

12:32.706 --> 12:34.773
Dameon here has all the
footage from the block party,

12:34.808 --> 12:36.942
- so hopefully Kayla's somewhere in it.
- Perfect.

12:36.977 --> 12:39.502
What do we got, flash drive, e-mail?

12:40.378 --> 12:41.977
Whoa, whoa.

12:44.518 --> 12:46.438
All right, that works, too.

12:46.778 --> 12:48.868
Andre ain't want to
leave nothing to chance.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.989
So he wanted to make
sure you had everything.

12:52.526 --> 12:55.660
What, what? That's called a
strategic partnership in action.

12:55.696 --> 12:57.863
Uh, Gideon, it's...

12:57.898 --> 13:00.125
it's gonna take a week to
go through all these phones.

13:00.150 --> 13:01.582
Maybe if Ada was here, I...

13:01.607 --> 13:03.859
Run a DPI compression protocol.

13:04.838 --> 13:06.953
Should make uploading faster.

13:08.467 --> 13:10.944
That's a great idea, actually,

13:10.969 --> 13:12.858
but it's still gonna take forever.

13:12.883 --> 13:15.984
Well, call in some
Reeves techs to help him.

13:16.019 --> 13:17.508
Help who?

13:17.821 --> 13:19.273
Dameon.

13:19.805 --> 13:21.266
You want a job at Reeves Industries?

13:21.291 --> 13:22.924
Thousand-dollar sign-on bonus

13:22.949 --> 13:26.273
if you can start, uh, now.

13:26.533 --> 13:28.234
Do I got to wear one of those ties?

13:28.259 --> 13:29.969
Never!

13:29.994 --> 13:31.234
Hell yeah.

13:31.259 --> 13:32.859
Okay.

13:32.909 --> 13:34.576
Would that go...?

13:34.601 --> 13:36.726
Pete, show him the ropes.

13:43.279 --> 13:44.689
Still don't get it.

13:44.714 --> 13:46.076
What's the point of
being out on the street

13:46.101 --> 13:47.727
if all you get is the silent treatment?

13:47.752 --> 13:49.718
People see Andre running
his investigation,

13:49.743 --> 13:51.084
they need to see us doing ours.

13:51.109 --> 13:53.276
Yeah, but we're supposed
to be catching a rapist.

13:53.301 --> 13:55.725
How is buddying up to a bunch
of bangers gonna get us anywhere?

13:55.750 --> 13:57.199
I'll tell you, when I was in Iraq...

13:57.224 --> 13:58.310
Oh, here we go.

13:58.335 --> 14:00.506
No, listen. No, when I was in Iraq,

14:00.531 --> 14:02.139
it was all about hearts and minds.

14:02.155 --> 14:03.455
You know, when you first touch down,

14:03.489 --> 14:05.295
all you can think about
is how everybody hates you.

14:05.320 --> 14:07.458
But, you know, you
stick around long enough,

14:07.493 --> 14:09.026
let people warm up to you,

14:09.061 --> 14:10.894
- they come around.
- Oh.

14:10.930 --> 14:13.030
So that's why Iraq is
such a beacon of peace

14:13.065 --> 14:14.607
in the world today.

14:14.632 --> 14:15.966
Look, over there.

14:16.002 --> 14:17.801
That's what I'm talking about.

14:17.837 --> 14:20.263
Couple of days ago, those guys
would have been running from us.

14:20.288 --> 14:22.688
But now that they know
we're not leaving...

14:22.908 --> 14:25.809
So you won over their hearts?
That's what you're saying?

14:25.845 --> 14:27.011
Yeah.

14:28.163 --> 14:29.695
Maybe I did.

14:31.169 --> 14:33.489
_

14:35.100 --> 14:37.548
Aw, Brandt, looks like your buddies

14:37.573 --> 14:39.665
wrote you a love letter.

14:46.404 --> 14:48.171
Do I even want to know
how you convinced Andre

14:48.196 --> 14:49.278
to send in this footage?

14:49.303 --> 14:50.855
Gideon kicked him in the ego.

14:50.880 --> 14:52.574
I don't think Andre's backing down.

14:52.599 --> 14:53.999
You realize this means more people

14:54.025 --> 14:55.424
winding up in the hospital, right?

14:55.460 --> 14:56.993
We really didn't have a choice.

14:57.028 --> 14:59.162
Murphy, this is basic detective work.

14:59.197 --> 15:01.063
You never give up something for nothing.

15:01.099 --> 15:03.060
If there was anything
suspicious in those videos,

15:03.085 --> 15:05.201
don't you think someone
would have said so by now?

15:05.236 --> 15:09.705
Why trust the fallibility
of human detection skills?

15:09.741 --> 15:10.973
The camera sees things

15:11.009 --> 15:12.608
that people don't even
realize they're seeing.

15:12.644 --> 15:14.410
So one of my drones..

15:14.445 --> 15:17.046
managed to avoid the
bats and the bullets

15:17.081 --> 15:19.260
long enough to...

15:21.354 --> 15:24.554
give us a 360 panorama of the park

15:24.589 --> 15:26.189
where the block party was held.

15:26.224 --> 15:28.958
And then the videos and the
pictures that Andre gave us

15:28.993 --> 15:32.860
were geo-located and
time-synced against it.

15:32.885 --> 15:34.063
I'll be damned.

15:34.098 --> 15:35.377
So what do we do now?

15:35.402 --> 15:36.732
We watch for Kayla's movements,

15:36.768 --> 15:38.534
see exactly when and
where she went missing,

15:38.570 --> 15:40.227
and if we can, see who took her.

15:40.252 --> 15:42.805
And then it's good-bye, block party;

15:42.840 --> 15:44.690
hello, cell block.

15:46.610 --> 15:48.476
You guys hate when I say
that kind of stuff, right?

15:48.501 --> 15:50.467
- Yes.
- Cool.

15:53.642 --> 15:57.235
Frame 60, scrub forward ten seconds.

15:57.283 --> 15:58.582
Find the edges.

15:58.617 --> 16:01.018
Gideon, are you sure
you're gonna find her?

16:01.053 --> 16:03.320
Our rape victim was at
the party 45 minutes.

16:03.355 --> 16:05.889
We've already seen
half an hour of video.

16:05.925 --> 16:07.591
There's a chance she might not be here.

16:07.626 --> 16:09.242
Between 30 phones,

16:09.267 --> 16:11.681
one of them definitely caught something.

16:13.839 --> 16:15.472
Wait.

16:15.507 --> 16:17.360
That pink dot.

16:20.643 --> 16:22.110
That's Kayla's jacket.

16:24.205 --> 16:26.619
Sample chroma in frame 55.

16:26.644 --> 16:28.314
Isolate target color.

16:29.855 --> 16:32.055
All right, so now that we
know what we're looking for...

16:32.090 --> 16:34.924
Play speed standard, smooth
interpolation, no blur.

16:36.995 --> 16:38.673
No, that's not it.

16:39.943 --> 16:41.475
No.

16:42.385 --> 16:44.945
Stop. There. At the end of the park.

16:44.970 --> 16:46.985
Frame 75, revert color isolation,

16:47.010 --> 16:49.077
play speed standard.

16:49.102 --> 16:51.007
Frame 75, enlarge three times.

16:51.650 --> 16:53.384
Come on, girl, I just want to talk.

16:53.409 --> 16:54.970
I said I got to go.

16:55.392 --> 16:56.746
Who's that?

16:56.781 --> 16:59.017
It's time-marked 3:36.

16:59.042 --> 17:01.528
If she left the party a minute later,

17:01.553 --> 17:04.453
then he's the last person
she talked to before she left.

17:04.478 --> 17:06.990
Well, that's not very
much to go on, so, uh,

17:07.025 --> 17:09.058
let me try to get a
different camera view.

17:09.094 --> 17:11.374
Play speed, minus one.

17:14.444 --> 17:17.010
Stop. Frame 93.

17:17.035 --> 17:19.102
Play speed standard, audio up.

17:19.137 --> 17:20.771
Hey, Los...

17:20.797 --> 17:23.606
Stop. Isolate frame 93. Crop edges.

17:23.642 --> 17:25.808
- What are you doing now?
- Pulling an image,

17:25.844 --> 17:28.122
so I can run it through
facial recognition.

17:28.146 --> 17:30.713
Do you see that on his neck?

17:30.749 --> 17:32.830
Frame 93, enlarge three times.

17:33.861 --> 17:35.985
That's a tat for an arena football team

17:36.021 --> 17:37.253
called the Vipers.

17:37.289 --> 17:39.322
Really? How do you know that?

17:39.357 --> 17:41.591
Well, while you were
in advanced calculus,

17:41.626 --> 17:44.423
I was in the playground
throwing long bombs.

17:45.819 --> 17:47.603
- Do you mind?
- Sure.

17:48.447 --> 17:51.267
So "Los" is probably
short for Carlos, right?

17:51.303 --> 17:53.836
And this guy definitely
looks like a running back.

17:53.872 --> 17:55.371
All right, I'm just
pulling up the team's roster

17:55.407 --> 17:56.783
from the past few years.

17:56.808 --> 17:57.907
There he is.

17:57.943 --> 17:59.842
Wells. Carlos Wells.

17:59.878 --> 18:02.178
Looks like he didn't keep
his aggression on the field.

18:02.214 --> 18:05.148
Carlos spent a couple years
in IDOC for aggravated battery.

18:05.183 --> 18:06.379
Murphy...

18:06.404 --> 18:07.670
home run!

18:08.717 --> 18:10.217
Or that's the...

18:10.696 --> 18:13.109
It's a touchdown, it's
a touchdown, isn't it?

18:55.533 --> 18:56.778
Okay.

19:47.839 --> 19:49.632
What the hell was that?

19:49.657 --> 19:52.270
Chill, it's just a glitch.

20:18.149 --> 20:21.118
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

20:30.261 --> 20:33.080
Cut the power! Shut down, now!

20:34.854 --> 20:36.425
_

20:59.635 --> 21:01.689
Any signs of Carlos Wells yet?

21:01.714 --> 21:03.197
We checked his house.

21:03.222 --> 21:05.395
Baby mama said he was
out getting liquored up

21:05.430 --> 21:06.662
at some bar on Halsted.

21:06.698 --> 21:08.831
Yeah, that's not a bad idea,

21:08.867 --> 21:10.965
considering he'll be
drinking prison hooch

21:10.990 --> 21:12.880
the rest of his life.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.537
Did you just say "hooch"?

21:14.606 --> 21:16.880
Yeah. Sorry.

21:17.880 --> 21:19.809
Are you sure Carlos is our guy?

21:19.844 --> 21:22.578
Hope so. He was the last
person seen with Kayla.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.888
Come on, bar's right up here.

21:25.067 --> 21:26.489
Seriously?

21:26.987 --> 21:29.487
Hey, yo. There he is.

21:29.701 --> 21:31.954
I got Carlos. You get our shadow.

21:32.802 --> 21:34.760
Yo, what's your problem?

21:34.785 --> 21:36.336
It ain't against the law to hang out.

21:36.361 --> 21:38.138
You got a mom?

21:38.163 --> 21:39.618
A sister?

21:39.643 --> 21:41.497
You know that's who we
trying to protect, right?

21:41.533 --> 21:42.999
Yeah? Since when?

21:43.034 --> 21:44.600
Seriously, kid?

21:44.636 --> 21:47.837
We're the good guys.
You think about that.

21:57.281 --> 21:59.198
Police! Don't move!

22:05.668 --> 22:06.963
Hey, get off me!

22:06.988 --> 22:09.231
- I didn't do anything.
- You're under arrest.

22:10.929 --> 22:13.275
I swear on my mama, I
didn't touch that girl.

22:13.300 --> 22:14.533
Do you see that?

22:16.073 --> 22:18.273
That's your hand on Kayla's arm.

22:18.298 --> 22:20.236
You were the last person
to be seen with her.

22:20.271 --> 22:21.370
Why is that?

22:21.406 --> 22:23.539
Before you answer, remember this:

22:23.575 --> 22:25.074
I'm the captain.

22:25.109 --> 22:26.909
This is my neighborhood.

22:26.945 --> 22:29.412
If you lie to us, you deal with me.

22:29.447 --> 22:31.113
But I don't know anything about it.

22:31.149 --> 22:33.520
- So why did you run?
- I got spooked.

22:33.545 --> 22:36.052
Andre put the word out: anyone
who touched Kayla's dead.

22:36.087 --> 22:38.588
- So you admit it?
- No, man, it's not like that.

22:38.623 --> 22:40.994
But Andre, he don't care.
He'd kill me just in case.

22:41.019 --> 22:43.359
You think that Andre's got
kids following the cops for fun?

22:43.394 --> 22:45.428
He's watching to see who
you've been talking to.

22:45.463 --> 22:48.367
If he reports back to Andre I
was talking to y'all, I'm dead.

22:48.392 --> 22:50.800
All right, Carlos,
let's go over this again.

22:50.835 --> 22:52.148
Now, you hit on Kayla.

22:52.173 --> 22:54.270
You were the last person
to be seen with her.

22:54.305 --> 22:56.304
Then you just run from
the cops just in case.

22:56.329 --> 22:57.707
Come on, you can do better than that.

22:57.742 --> 22:59.090
It's the truth!

22:59.115 --> 23:00.381
B-But the...

23:00.406 --> 23:01.611
I wasn't the last guy to make a move.

23:01.646 --> 23:03.679
She also talked to some
dude in a brown car.

23:03.715 --> 23:05.679
Okay? You should talk to that guy.

23:09.472 --> 23:11.888
We've already watched
every single second of this.

23:11.923 --> 23:13.589
I don't remember seeing a brown sedan.

23:13.625 --> 23:15.625
Something tells me Carlos
is yanking our chain

23:15.660 --> 23:17.367
just to save his own skin.

23:17.392 --> 23:18.628
Nada.

23:18.663 --> 23:20.563
Zilch, yeah.

23:20.598 --> 23:23.199
I'm not seeing...
Whoa, hold, hold, hold.

23:23.234 --> 23:25.034
Playback frame 62.

23:25.069 --> 23:26.117
Speed standard.

23:26.142 --> 23:27.208
Blow up five.

23:27.233 --> 23:29.750
Enhance three times.

23:31.863 --> 23:33.461
Huh.

23:33.511 --> 23:35.411
Well, Carlos might be a creep,

23:35.446 --> 23:38.147
but apparently he's not a liar.

23:41.633 --> 23:44.897
So Carlos said that Kayla was
talking to someone in that car.

23:44.922 --> 23:47.255
But without plates, it's gonna
be hard to identify who owns it.

23:47.324 --> 23:49.191
Well, how can the guy
drive around with no plates?

23:49.226 --> 23:50.748
Probably sticks to the neighborhood.

23:50.773 --> 23:51.860
Nobody asks questions there.

23:51.895 --> 23:54.139
I'm guessing '76, maybe '77.

23:54.164 --> 23:56.190
Maybe that'll narrow it down.

23:56.215 --> 23:59.034
All right, well, so, run
any matching registrations

23:59.069 --> 24:00.435
in the area.

24:01.244 --> 24:03.065
Um...

24:04.174 --> 24:05.150
You good?

24:05.175 --> 24:07.047
I mean, honestly, Ada's system

24:07.072 --> 24:09.144
is designed for Ada. I'm...

24:09.179 --> 24:11.713
I'm more of a hardware
than a software kind of guy,

24:11.748 --> 24:13.150
but I'll figure it out.

24:13.511 --> 24:14.922
Well, we do know somebody

24:14.947 --> 24:16.981
who might know who that car belongs to.

24:17.557 --> 24:19.221
You want to go back to Andre.

24:19.256 --> 24:20.782
He knows what everybody drives.

24:20.807 --> 24:22.424
I mean, he could I.D.
that car in five seconds.

24:22.459 --> 24:24.790
That's what we have databases for.

24:24.815 --> 24:26.493
Except they're not getting us anywhere.

24:26.518 --> 24:27.875
I know, I know,

24:27.900 --> 24:30.361
you're not president
of the Andre fan club.

24:30.409 --> 24:32.861
Because I know how this ends, Gideon.

24:33.446 --> 24:35.612
A few years back, I worked a case,

24:35.648 --> 24:38.782
eight-year-old kid killed in
crossfire on Andre's block.

24:38.818 --> 24:40.818
Andre said he'd help
us catch the shooter,

24:40.853 --> 24:43.554
said he wanted to get
justice for the little boy.

24:43.589 --> 24:44.922
You know what we got?

24:44.957 --> 24:48.058
Three suspects with
bullets through their heads.

24:48.093 --> 24:49.726
Andre went vigilante.

24:49.762 --> 24:51.361
Innocent people died.

24:51.397 --> 24:53.497
Now, that might be
Andre's version of justice,

24:53.532 --> 24:55.666
but it sure as hell isn't mine.

24:57.897 --> 24:59.170
You're right.

24:59.195 --> 25:00.528
You're right.

25:00.553 --> 25:02.616
Andre is a bad guy.

25:03.186 --> 25:05.453
But so was Joseph Stalin.

25:05.478 --> 25:07.556
And if we hadn't found
a way to work with him,

25:07.581 --> 25:09.348
we'd all be speaking German.

25:11.905 --> 25:13.417
Do what you got to do.

25:13.584 --> 25:16.569
Just remember what
this man is capable of.

25:21.722 --> 25:23.780
- Hello.
- Oh, my God!

25:25.186 --> 25:26.964
Think you're clever?

25:26.999 --> 25:29.500
Stealing my clients'
information like that?

25:29.535 --> 25:32.336
Well, I had to get
your attention somehow.

25:33.545 --> 25:36.624
Okay. I thought that, uh,
we would do this over coffee,

25:36.649 --> 25:39.409
but since you're already here...

25:39.445 --> 25:43.272
That's evidence of money
laundering and tax evasion.

25:43.655 --> 25:45.215
I just thought the
feds might want to hear

25:45.240 --> 25:46.819
what you've been up to.

25:47.241 --> 25:48.852
Best case scenario,

25:48.888 --> 25:52.263
you make a deal, you get put in WITSEC,

25:52.288 --> 25:54.191
and you spend the rest of
your life bussing tables

25:54.226 --> 25:56.600
at a greasy spoon in Springfield.

25:57.006 --> 25:59.209
Worst case scenario,

25:59.436 --> 26:01.532
your clients find out
that you turned snitch,

26:01.567 --> 26:03.667
and you end up at the
bottom of Lake Michigan.

26:03.702 --> 26:06.537
I'm fighting against a
totalitarian state here.

26:07.587 --> 26:09.709
Why don't I just kill you?

26:10.999 --> 26:13.744
Call it collateral damage
for the greater good.

26:13.779 --> 26:15.012
You could do that.

26:15.047 --> 26:18.991
But this information is
randomly set to auto-send.

26:20.064 --> 26:21.985
Unless I stop it.

26:22.021 --> 26:24.580
It'd be a huge gamble on your part.

26:25.244 --> 26:26.890
There is one other option.

26:26.926 --> 26:29.660
I could not send the information,

26:29.695 --> 26:31.987
and you could never,

26:32.012 --> 26:34.861
ever come near me again.

26:36.424 --> 26:38.001
How do I know that your police friends

26:38.037 --> 26:40.571
aren't gonna be paying me another visit?

26:40.606 --> 26:41.908
Because whether you like it or not,

26:41.933 --> 26:43.766
I have the power to stop it.

26:45.463 --> 26:47.244
Back off me.

26:47.279 --> 26:48.679
Back off the 13th.

26:48.714 --> 26:51.111
It's really that simple.

26:53.084 --> 26:54.517
Fine.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.596
But just know...

26:58.591 --> 27:00.324
this isn't over.

27:00.518 --> 27:02.225
It better be.

27:02.557 --> 27:06.299
Otherwise you'll be writing your
manifesto on a cell block wall.

27:18.367 --> 27:19.820
Call off the dogs, Andre.

27:19.845 --> 27:21.155
We have a suspect.

27:21.180 --> 27:22.512
- Give me a name.
- I don't have one.

27:22.548 --> 27:24.820
But we do have a car, and
that's where you come in.

27:24.845 --> 27:26.083
Send me what you got.

27:26.118 --> 27:27.451
My boys will go handle that.

27:27.486 --> 27:29.920
Uh, thing is, it'll be
pretty hard to press charges

27:29.955 --> 27:32.723
on a guy who's not,
you know, alive anymore.

27:32.748 --> 27:34.071
Oh, that's just the law of the streets.

27:34.096 --> 27:35.108
Come on, Andre.

27:35.133 --> 27:37.705
Let's just take a ride. Be
done with this once and for all.

27:37.730 --> 27:40.297
Fine. But my crew's still out tonight.

27:40.332 --> 27:41.565
Where we going?

27:41.600 --> 27:42.966
Okay, okay.

27:43.002 --> 27:44.134
Uh...

27:44.169 --> 27:46.003
see that car?

27:46.038 --> 27:48.014
That's the one we
pulled from the videos.

27:48.039 --> 27:49.773
- You recognize it?
- Yeah.

27:49.808 --> 27:51.241
That's Kevin Dodson's whip.

27:51.276 --> 27:53.532
Live off of, uh, 61st.

27:53.557 --> 27:55.351
Ah.

27:55.376 --> 27:57.376
Then that's where we're going.

28:00.219 --> 28:01.918
Yo, homey, Five-0.

28:01.954 --> 28:03.707
Yo, I'm out.

28:06.668 --> 28:08.418
Yo, Dodson.

28:09.668 --> 28:11.361
I don't want no trouble, Andre.

28:11.397 --> 28:13.830
Heard you rolled up on
Kayla at the block party.

28:13.866 --> 28:15.549
- Right before she got raped.
- What?

28:15.574 --> 28:18.393
Uh, this is your car at the block party.

28:18.418 --> 28:20.588
I checked the traffic cams in the area.

28:20.613 --> 28:22.739
It didn't leave till after the attack.

28:22.775 --> 28:25.346
- Do you want to explain?
- I wasn't at no block party.

28:25.371 --> 28:26.877
I ain't been driving that car neither.

28:26.912 --> 28:28.612
My probation officer took my car.

28:28.639 --> 28:30.548
He said he thought I was
using it for drug runs.

28:30.573 --> 28:32.151
I told him I wasn't,
but he took it anyway.

28:32.176 --> 28:33.442
You think I'm stupid?

28:33.486 --> 28:35.761
I ain't never heard of
no P.O. taking a car.

28:35.786 --> 28:37.972
You see a car around here anywhere?

28:38.327 --> 28:39.993
I've been taking the bus.

28:40.769 --> 28:42.066
What's your P.O.'s name?

28:42.102 --> 28:43.501
Vince Yardley, over at Cook County.

28:43.536 --> 28:44.746
He the one took my car.

28:44.771 --> 28:46.504
I ain't seen it since.

28:47.741 --> 28:49.373
Probation officer.

28:49.409 --> 28:50.705
How about that?

28:50.730 --> 28:52.543
All this time, you been
coming at my people,

28:52.579 --> 28:54.479
thinking one of them is the rapist.

28:54.514 --> 28:56.247
Turns out, it's one of yours.

29:01.570 --> 29:03.310
Let me get this straight.

29:03.335 --> 29:05.916
You're saying a Chicago
probation officer

29:05.941 --> 29:08.008
is the one who attacked those two girls.

29:08.043 --> 29:09.910
That is a serious accusation,

29:09.945 --> 29:13.146
especially just off the word
of some ex-con off the street.

29:13.182 --> 29:15.916
Well, I checked the
pod-cams, just in case,

29:15.984 --> 29:19.619
and it looks like the probation
officer really took the car.

29:19.655 --> 29:22.389
Dodson was on a bus headed crosstown

29:22.424 --> 29:24.570
when Kayla was attacked.

29:28.572 --> 29:30.497
District 21, this is Captain Wolf.

29:30.532 --> 29:32.599
Joe, Ned Conrad at the 13th.

29:32.634 --> 29:34.868
Listen, um, I'm
following up on a suspect

29:34.903 --> 29:37.639
assigned to one of your
guys, Vince Yardley?

29:37.664 --> 29:39.206
You mind grabbing him for me?

29:39.241 --> 29:41.174
Sorry, Ned, he's not around.

29:41.210 --> 29:44.277
I just tried calling,
phone's going to voice mail.

29:44.313 --> 29:46.242
The last I checked, he
was doing home visits

29:46.267 --> 29:47.594
in your neck of the woods.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.693
So Yardley's in Garfield Park.

29:49.718 --> 29:51.874
- Looks like it.
- Thanks.

29:52.305 --> 29:53.653
He's down here.

29:53.689 --> 29:55.722
That son of a bitch is down here

29:55.757 --> 29:57.991
in my neighborhood right now.

30:05.790 --> 30:08.579
All right, I want everyone
going in quiet and dark.

30:08.604 --> 30:10.504
We want to catch this
guy, not spook him.

30:10.538 --> 30:12.505
Copy that, squad, but we
got a lot of ground to cover.

30:12.541 --> 30:13.673
Even in stealth mode,

30:13.709 --> 30:15.475
there's a good chance
he might hear us coming.

30:15.511 --> 30:16.877
Yeah, I've been thinking about that.

30:16.912 --> 30:18.478
So...

30:18.514 --> 30:20.669
the best way to find Yardley...

30:20.694 --> 30:23.074
is to hear him before he hears us.

30:23.099 --> 30:24.138
What are you talking about?

30:24.163 --> 30:26.253
Well, all the District 13 cruisers

30:26.288 --> 30:28.522
are outfitted with microphones

30:28.557 --> 30:30.471
that have a frequency response range

30:30.496 --> 30:32.158
sharp enough to hear
a fly two blocks over.

30:32.194 --> 30:34.661
So, we know what Yardley's driving.

30:34.696 --> 30:37.597
We got the make, the model and the year.

30:37.633 --> 30:40.333
Whoa. Is that our garage?

30:40.369 --> 30:42.502
Yeah. Yeah. Found a sedan

30:42.538 --> 30:46.373
just like the one our suspect
stole at a used lot in Aurora.

30:46.408 --> 30:49.875
Smells like wet dog, but
it only cost me 700 bucks.

30:49.900 --> 30:51.645
Bobby, give it a little
bit of juice, please?

30:55.117 --> 30:57.891
So we extract the sound,

30:57.916 --> 31:00.010
create an audio file.

31:00.018 --> 31:01.580
Voila.

31:02.334 --> 31:04.000
We have a sound signature.

31:04.025 --> 31:06.225
Not bad. So, guys, I'm sending

31:06.250 --> 31:08.150
the sound signature from
our suspect's vehicle

31:08.175 --> 31:09.555
to your cruisers right now.

31:09.580 --> 31:11.985
I need everybody to
boost the on-board mics.

31:12.010 --> 31:14.664
Hey, boss, you know how much I love,

31:14.689 --> 31:17.200
uh, randomly pressing
your buttons, but, uh,

31:17.235 --> 31:18.862
how's does this work exactly?

31:18.887 --> 31:22.155
It's actually a pretty simple
acoustic identification method.

31:22.180 --> 31:25.371
The computer selects sounds
and sorts them by frequency.

31:32.805 --> 31:35.573
Hang on, are we listening
to the whole neighborhood?

31:35.598 --> 31:38.299
Yeah. Until we find the sound we need.

31:38.555 --> 31:40.889
We're also mapping the sources.

31:46.229 --> 31:48.329
Oh, yes. Oh, my...

31:48.354 --> 31:49.548
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:49.573 --> 31:50.735
We should see where this one goes.

31:50.760 --> 31:52.260
Um, try the Internet.

31:52.285 --> 31:53.785
After your shift.

32:00.665 --> 32:02.732
Gideon, I'm getting plenty of sounds,

32:02.768 --> 32:04.434
but none that's helping us find Yardley.

32:04.469 --> 32:05.769
All right. Give it a sec.

32:05.804 --> 32:09.139
Sound needs to hit the mics
at just the right angle.

32:14.667 --> 32:16.846
1309, squad, I think I got something.

32:18.016 --> 32:19.482
Stop struggling and shut up.

32:19.518 --> 32:21.628
Gideon, where's that sound coming from?

32:21.653 --> 32:22.917
We gonna have some fun.

32:22.942 --> 32:24.442
Info's coming through on your dash.

32:31.646 --> 32:33.403
You're gonna love it.

32:33.428 --> 32:35.365
We're gonna have so much fun, baby.

32:38.152 --> 32:40.591
- I don't see the car.
- Got to be somewhere.

32:40.616 --> 32:43.293
Engine sounds are coming
through loud and clear.

32:47.874 --> 32:49.307
Hold on.

32:57.198 --> 32:59.198
Police! Come out with your hands up!

32:59.738 --> 33:01.244
Don't move!

33:03.455 --> 33:04.521
Stop!

33:08.374 --> 33:09.506
Are you okay?

33:09.531 --> 33:11.487
He grabbed me. I-I couldn't get away.

33:11.512 --> 33:12.711
You're safe now.

33:15.393 --> 33:16.916
He went toward Dearborn!

33:18.386 --> 33:19.885
Can you track the car while it's moving?

33:19.910 --> 33:23.545
Yep. Uh, just give me
a second to triangulate.

33:23.676 --> 33:25.742
There. Yardley's the one on the left.

33:25.767 --> 33:26.995
Goss and Brandt are in the other one.

33:27.020 --> 33:28.286
Yardley is on Morgan.

33:28.311 --> 33:29.410
Take the next left.

33:40.107 --> 33:41.596
Whoa, whoa!

33:51.940 --> 33:53.327
What happened? How did we lose him?

33:53.352 --> 33:54.753
We're not picking up the engine sounds.

33:54.789 --> 33:56.152
Maybe the mics got wind damaged or...

33:56.177 --> 33:57.823
Maybe he cut the engine.

34:03.365 --> 34:05.402
I think I know what happened.

34:07.303 --> 34:09.357
Damn it, where the hell did he go?

34:09.670 --> 34:12.737
1305, squad be advised,
suspect fled on foot.

34:12.773 --> 34:15.364
You got a direction?
Any idea where he went?

34:15.732 --> 34:18.911
Sorry, squad, he's gone.

34:21.507 --> 34:24.708
All right, uh, we could
send more patrol down there,

34:24.733 --> 34:27.319
but we're talking about
all of Garfield Park.

34:27.355 --> 34:28.587
Yardley could be anywhere.

34:28.623 --> 34:30.222
By the time we get more cars down there,

34:30.257 --> 34:31.692
he'll be gone.

34:31.717 --> 34:33.492
We need to find him another way.

34:33.527 --> 34:35.127
I don't know what
that is, unless you got

34:35.161 --> 34:37.295
some secret cops lying around
that I don't know about.

34:37.331 --> 34:40.099
I'm not talking about more cops.

34:42.333 --> 34:44.458
I'm gonna talk to Andre.

34:53.592 --> 34:54.933
Nah.

34:55.007 --> 34:58.040
Look who just walked up in here.

34:58.064 --> 35:01.345
Captain Conrad, the damn
defender of the universe.

35:01.380 --> 35:02.798
Been a while.

35:02.823 --> 35:05.450
Last time we met, you
was trying to put me

35:05.484 --> 35:07.451
in Stateville for 25 to life.

35:07.486 --> 35:10.072
The past is the past.

35:10.697 --> 35:14.068
Right now, there's a serial
rapist in your neighborhood.

35:14.093 --> 35:16.593
He's on foot, so he can't have gone far.

35:16.629 --> 35:18.629
Let me guess. You want my help.

35:18.697 --> 35:20.964
You know what, since you
came all the way down here,

35:20.989 --> 35:23.523
how about we talk about you
reopening that spot on Aberdeen

35:23.548 --> 35:24.687
you and your cops shut down?

35:24.712 --> 35:26.103
This ain't no negotiation.

35:26.138 --> 35:28.905
You say you care about
the people in your hood.

35:28.941 --> 35:30.507
Then show it.

35:30.542 --> 35:31.986
I'm listening.

35:32.011 --> 35:33.944
Vince Yardley, that probation officer

35:33.979 --> 35:36.452
who we suspect raped those two girls...

35:36.477 --> 35:37.756
he's in Garfield Park.

35:37.781 --> 35:39.650
Now, I know you got boys on the street.

35:39.685 --> 35:42.986
I need you to get the
word out to find Yardley.

35:43.022 --> 35:45.055
Like that, uh, APB thing y'all got?

35:45.090 --> 35:47.695
You want that, uh, that Andre PB.

35:48.164 --> 35:49.626
Call it what you want,

35:49.662 --> 35:51.728
but we got to work
together on this, Andre.

35:51.764 --> 35:53.764
I'll send you what my cops get.

35:53.799 --> 35:55.365
Have your boys do the same.

35:55.401 --> 35:57.968
You asking or you telling?

35:59.238 --> 36:00.504
Both.

36:12.743 --> 36:14.651
_

36:18.959 --> 36:21.169
Andre says he checked
everything south of Garfield,

36:21.194 --> 36:22.459
and no one's seen Yardley yet.

36:22.494 --> 36:25.128
Let him know we have units
posted two blocks north.

36:25.164 --> 36:26.763
There he is.

36:26.799 --> 36:29.199
Uh, guys? I think Andre found him.

36:29.234 --> 36:31.168
Three corner boys just
took off down LaSalle.

36:31.203 --> 36:32.202
Get in there, now!

36:32.237 --> 36:33.637
On our way, Murph.

36:36.233 --> 36:38.405
- Pete, we need to launch the drone.
- I'm all over it.

36:43.184 --> 36:44.316
We got him now.

36:44.341 --> 36:46.193
There's only one way out this building.

36:48.253 --> 36:49.575
Come on!

37:06.910 --> 37:08.026
Where'd they go?

37:08.051 --> 37:09.699
It could be any one of these buildings.

37:09.724 --> 37:12.338
Okay, then, Cobb with me.
We'll take the north side.

37:12.363 --> 37:14.726
Brandt, Goss, you take the south.

37:14.751 --> 37:16.238
It's this way.

37:22.651 --> 37:24.921
Time to get a better
vantage point of our own.

37:24.957 --> 37:26.156
What do you say, Pete?

37:26.191 --> 37:27.354
Yep, I'm all over it.

37:27.379 --> 37:28.401
You thought you could run from me?

37:28.426 --> 37:29.792
- No, man, no!
- Huh?

37:29.817 --> 37:31.051
- Huh, Yardley?
- Please! Andre!

37:31.076 --> 37:32.609
Murphy, they're on the roof.

37:34.158 --> 37:36.057
- Please, man.
- Yardley, since we're already up here,

37:36.082 --> 37:37.648
- let's see if you can fly.
- No! Andre, Andre, Andre...

37:37.673 --> 37:39.239
Let him go, Andre!

37:39.264 --> 37:41.215
Please. Please, man.

37:41.240 --> 37:43.206
Tell your cops back off.

37:43.242 --> 37:44.708
I got this.

37:44.743 --> 37:45.909
No, we've got this.

37:45.944 --> 37:47.210
This isn't just about you.

37:47.246 --> 37:48.512
If you drop him,

37:48.547 --> 37:49.913
there's no coming back from it.

37:49.948 --> 37:51.381
Coming back from what?

37:51.417 --> 37:52.649
All I know is

37:52.684 --> 37:56.158
my Kings will gonna your
cops back down them stairs.

37:56.183 --> 37:58.393
And then clumsy over here gonna trip.

37:59.609 --> 38:01.008
- You got to help me.
- Damn it.

38:01.059 --> 38:02.192
He doesn't want any witnesses.

38:02.227 --> 38:03.627
We still have the drone.

38:03.662 --> 38:05.881
He already shot one out of the air.

38:05.906 --> 38:08.031
Okay. Hold on, hold on.

38:08.617 --> 38:11.001
Hey, Andre, listen to me.

38:11.036 --> 38:12.335
If you're behind bars,

38:12.371 --> 38:13.837
who's gonna take over that neighborhood?

38:13.872 --> 38:15.972
Who's gonna take care of your people?

38:16.206 --> 38:17.405
You let him go,

38:17.430 --> 38:19.843
you and your boys walk away from this,

38:19.878 --> 38:21.586
no questions asked.

38:25.289 --> 38:26.483
Look around.

38:26.518 --> 38:27.884
Okay?

38:27.911 --> 38:29.210
It's what Gideon said.

38:29.254 --> 38:30.654
It's a new 13th.

38:42.468 --> 38:44.828
Like I said, clumsy.

38:55.380 --> 38:56.627
Yes.

38:59.869 --> 39:02.297
On behalf of the 13th District,

39:02.322 --> 39:04.758
I'd would like to thank
you all for coming.

39:04.783 --> 39:06.823
Ah, okay.

39:09.307 --> 39:11.027
Who here likes cops?

39:11.063 --> 39:13.563
Just kidding, don't answer.
Don't answer, please.

39:13.674 --> 39:16.612
Let's face it, things
are not good right now,

39:16.637 --> 39:18.468
this neighborhood and the cops.

39:18.504 --> 39:20.504
We are not vibing.

39:21.707 --> 39:23.273
We actually need to come together.

39:23.308 --> 39:24.508
And I am here

39:24.543 --> 39:27.845
to make that first expensive step.

39:27.870 --> 39:29.012
Now, I know what you're thinking.

39:29.047 --> 39:33.089
Community center, linoleum floors,

39:33.323 --> 39:35.501
depressing folding chairs.

39:35.526 --> 39:37.020
Not here, no. Won't be any of that.

39:37.055 --> 39:39.490
Think bigger. New computers.

39:39.795 --> 39:41.491
Maybe some virtu...

39:41.527 --> 39:43.126
I don't want to give it away.

39:43.161 --> 39:44.327
All right, twist my arm.

39:44.352 --> 39:48.441
Three words: basketball
coach Scottie Pippen!

39:48.466 --> 39:50.734
That's four words. Expensive, yes.

39:50.769 --> 39:53.637
Guess what, you're
worth it. That's right.

39:55.207 --> 39:57.388
Thank you. Thank you.

39:57.439 --> 40:00.640
Uh... so a place like this

40:00.746 --> 40:02.579
deserves to be called something special,

40:02.614 --> 40:04.948
and that's why I'm naming it...

40:04.973 --> 40:07.725
after the person that
brought us all together.

40:08.353 --> 40:10.320
Welcome to Kayla's Place.

40:16.293 --> 40:18.209
Yeah.

40:19.131 --> 40:21.331
Look at that. Lasers.

40:21.366 --> 40:22.632
Cool.

40:22.668 --> 40:23.700
Okay.

40:23.735 --> 40:26.100
Thanks. Cool.

40:26.125 --> 40:29.026
What do you think, too
after-school special?

40:30.263 --> 40:31.653
Just enough.

40:32.459 --> 40:34.381
Kayla's mom's here.

40:34.947 --> 40:37.113
She says it's gonna be a long road,

40:37.149 --> 40:39.416
but she's expected to
have a full recovery.

40:39.451 --> 40:41.685
Well, that's the best
news I've heard all day.

40:41.720 --> 40:42.850
Somebody's not too happy

40:42.875 --> 40:44.908
about your new addition
to the neighborhood.

40:46.334 --> 40:49.025
I guess a new community center
is not good for drug sales.

40:49.061 --> 40:52.662
That's precisely why I didn't
consult him on the plans.

40:52.698 --> 40:53.863
Careful, Gideon.

40:53.899 --> 40:55.999
We might need Andre's
help again one day.

40:56.034 --> 40:58.635
No, let him sulk for a while.

40:58.670 --> 41:00.666
People need to know that we're here,

41:00.691 --> 41:02.525
we're part of this neighborhood.

41:02.550 --> 41:04.040
And he can be damn sure

41:04.076 --> 41:07.064
we're not going anywhere anytime soon.

41:24.471 --> 41:26.699
- Miss me?
- Yeah, actually, I did.

41:26.724 --> 41:28.245
Come in.

41:29.724 --> 41:31.027
Uh...

41:32.206 --> 41:34.404
So, I know that you, uh,

41:34.473 --> 41:36.876
wanted to know what was going on.

41:36.901 --> 41:38.742
Got into a little bit of trouble.

41:38.777 --> 41:42.173
Yeah. Those new locks
kind of tipped it off.

41:42.198 --> 41:45.120
Mm-hmm. This crazy thing
came back from my past,

41:45.159 --> 41:47.183
and I just had to deal with it.

41:47.252 --> 41:49.519
Okay. So do I want to know or...

41:49.588 --> 41:50.987
- No.
- Yeah.

41:51.056 --> 41:52.422
Okay. Is it over?

41:52.457 --> 41:53.723
I think so.

41:54.565 --> 41:58.561
Uh, look, I know that I
probably can't come back

41:58.630 --> 42:00.330
after bailing on you like that,

42:00.399 --> 42:02.499
and you probably aren't gonna

42:02.524 --> 42:05.268
trust me anymore...

42:06.385 --> 42:08.799
Yeah. Probably shouldn't.

42:09.167 --> 42:10.473
Here's the thing, though.

42:10.509 --> 42:12.242
Seven years ago, when
you hacked my company,

42:12.310 --> 42:14.245
I knew you had a past.

42:15.247 --> 42:17.714
This doesn't change that, right?

42:19.284 --> 42:21.220
Not great at, uh...

42:22.220 --> 42:25.798
displays of emotional
things, but, you know,

42:26.915 --> 42:29.103
I already lost a best friend this year.

42:29.128 --> 42:31.142
Can't lose another one, so...

42:32.597 --> 42:34.548
I'll see you on Monday.

42:37.775 --> 42:39.402
Okay.

42:41.073 --> 42:43.042
- Oh, for God's sakes.
- I'm sorry.

42:43.067 --> 42:44.972
Ah, just come here.

42:46.472 --> 42:48.909
See? This is the part I'm bad at.

42:50.382 --> 42:52.505
It's gonna be okay.

42:52.530 --> 42:54.925
Everything's gonna be okay.
