01:12.672 --> 01:13.832
Oh, God.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.740
Well, what the hell happened?

01:22.248 --> 01:24.307
- We're an old married couple.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:29.622 --> 01:31.089
Was it the pot?

01:34.127 --> 01:37.028
I don't think so, because we brought it
with us from New York.

01:37.130 --> 01:38.927
- Yeah.
- It's the same.

01:41.968 --> 01:43.401
What was that...

01:46.272 --> 01:49.173
What was that old movie?

01:51.711 --> 01:54.612
<i>You know, Blame it on Rio.</i>

01:57.817 --> 02:00.183
It has to be that, it has to be that.

02:05.091 --> 02:07.059
You got to feel my heart.

02:11.364 --> 02:14.162
Are you going to make it till dinnertime?

02:20.173 --> 02:21.765
After dinnertime.

02:29.649 --> 02:30.843
Oh, God.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.286
God, I'd love to live like this.

02:39.792 --> 02:40.850
Yeah.

02:42.295 --> 02:47.665
I'm willing, if you have enough money
to stay in Brazil for the rest of our lives.

02:53.273 --> 02:55.002
I'll think about it.

02:58.511 --> 02:59.569
Okay.

03:10.156 --> 03:12.522
Do you think that's it, being away?

03:16.596 --> 03:17.961
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:25.738 --> 03:27.035
Hey, babe.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.802
Where did you go?

03:34.914 --> 03:36.905
Don't do this to yourself.

03:39.686 --> 03:41.620
Everything is wonderful.

03:43.756 --> 03:45.690
Everything is wonderful.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.628
Mmm-hmm.

03:50.730 --> 03:51.788
Yeah.

03:55.902 --> 03:59.702
I don't feel like such a fuck-up
when I'm here, that's all.

04:40.980 --> 04:43.278
Good luck.
See you in a bit.

04:45.852 --> 04:47.217
I love you.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.498
Okay.

05:10.710 --> 05:13.838
Don't touch anything.
Don't say anything. Back up.

05:13.946 --> 05:16.414
Turn off the lights. Turn them off.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.045
Are you... Don't even think about the buzzer.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.714
Get in the corner.

05:28.261 --> 05:30.889
Is the cash in here? Open it up. Open it up!

05:30.997 --> 05:33.795
Quicker. Get over here. Get over here.
You want me to fucking shoot you?

05:33.900 --> 05:35.868
Open it up. Open it up.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.862
Get over in the corner. Get over
in the corner. Keep your hands down.

05:39.972 --> 05:42.133
Keep your fucking hands down.

05:43.443 --> 05:44.740
All right?

05:49.749 --> 05:52.115
Come over here.
Get over here so I can see you.

05:52.218 --> 05:55.346
Come over here. Stand at the corner.
Come over here.

05:55.455 --> 05:58.151
Put your hands down. Put your hands down.

06:01.461 --> 06:03.827
Oh, shit! Is this all you got in here?

06:05.231 --> 06:08.997
I'm watching...
Stay away from the fucking buzzer, all right.

06:10.336 --> 06:12.236
Fucking shit, it's all she...
Get back in your corner.

06:12.338 --> 06:15.603
Get back in your fucking...
Get back in your corner!

06:20.980 --> 06:25.076
All right, keep your hands down
by your side, all right. I'm watching you.

06:25.184 --> 06:29.018
I will shoot you, all right.
I'll fucking shoot you in a second.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.149
This is all shit.

06:34.026 --> 06:35.254
Diamonds.

06:38.030 --> 06:39.827
Where's the fucking keys for this case?

06:39.932 --> 06:41.661
Where's the...
Where are the keys for this case?

06:41.768 --> 06:44.236
- In the drawer.
- Shut up, all right.

06:45.671 --> 06:48.640
These are them?
Don't fucking move, all right.

06:49.008 --> 06:50.339
Don't move.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.969
What, are they all the same?

06:53.279 --> 06:54.507
Are they?

06:54.914 --> 06:56.643
Fucking stupid bitch.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.742
I'm watching you.

07:00.052 --> 07:03.488
Which fucking key... Which fucking...
This is bullshit!

07:05.491 --> 07:07.254
What the fuck is up...

07:07.593 --> 07:09.754
What type of glass is this...

07:10.530 --> 07:12.555
Fuck is up with this glass?

07:12.999 --> 07:14.330
Fuck this...

07:17.170 --> 07:18.398
Bullshit.

07:18.638 --> 07:20.003
Fuck this...

07:23.209 --> 07:24.403
Fuck, no.

07:28.181 --> 07:31.241
Fuck you, you motherfucking stupid fuck.

07:33.386 --> 07:34.410
Fuck.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.018
My gun.

08:31.377 --> 08:33.004
Fuck! Andy!

08:35.780 --> 08:37.645
Hank, you're so stupid!

08:44.690 --> 08:46.123
Fucking Andy!

08:49.695 --> 08:50.719
Shit.

09:19.926 --> 09:22.952
Hey, two for four. You're batting.500.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.290
No, Dad, the second one was an air...

09:24.397 --> 09:26.456
- No, no. It was a perfectly placed bunt.
- Good game, sweetheart.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.692
- Good game.
How many you got?

09:27.800 --> 09:29.131
Yeah, who's going to want seconds?

09:29.235 --> 09:31.032
Uncle Andy, can I have another hot dog?

09:31.137 --> 09:33.401
Yeah, the way you played today,
I'll buy you the whole stand.

09:33.506 --> 09:35.269
No, her mother doesn't want
her eating junk, all right?

09:35.374 --> 09:38.104
That's not junk, that's all right.
That's a hot dog, right, honey?

09:38.210 --> 09:39.199
What do I owe you?

09:39.312 --> 09:40.870
Hey, Hank,
your money is no good here.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.470
No, I got it, okay.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.311
- I got it.
- You sure?

09:49.989 --> 09:52.890
- That was a good game.
- Yeah.

09:52.992 --> 09:54.118
Hey, give me a kiss. Give me a kiss.

09:54.226 --> 09:55.716
- All right. I'll see you next weekend?
- I love you.

09:55.828 --> 09:58.296
All right, be good. Here's your ball.

09:58.397 --> 10:01.457
- You didn't feed her junk, did you?
- No, of course not.

10:01.567 --> 10:03.125
I don't want her to develop
bad eating habits.

10:03.235 --> 10:04.896
- She looks puffy.
- She doesn't look puffy, all right.

10:05.004 --> 10:06.995
- You look puffy.
- Fuck you.

10:07.139 --> 10:09.471
- She wore sun block?
- It was cloudy, Martha.

10:09.575 --> 10:12.271
There are rays, Hank.
Hey, you got my money?

10:12.378 --> 10:16.337
Oh, Christ, Martha. Do you have any idea
what that school is costing me?

10:16.449 --> 10:17.643
You're the one
who wanted to send her there.

10:17.750 --> 10:20.344
Yeah, because it is a damn good school
and she wanted to go there.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.785
- You owe me three months.
- I don't owe you.

10:22.888 --> 10:25.652
- I owe Danielle.
- Don't get semantic.

10:25.758 --> 10:28.022
- Bye.
- April, May and June.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.400
No, I promise, all right.

10:39.939 --> 10:41.497
What's up, Hank?

10:42.408 --> 10:43.875
Piece of shit!

10:47.380 --> 10:50.543
Fuck you. All right.
Can I borrow your cell phone?

10:51.384 --> 10:52.976
I don't have one.

10:53.285 --> 10:55.378
- Just...
- It's brain cancer. There's a pay phone

10:55.488 --> 10:58.457
- over there by the bathroom.
- No, it can wait.

10:59.558 --> 11:01.549
What's happening with you?

11:02.128 --> 11:03.390
I used to think you had
the world by the balls.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.090
Now, I'm not sure if you even got any.

11:06.198 --> 11:08.132
I got them when I need them, all right?

11:08.234 --> 11:09.292
Yeah.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.167
Yeah, smart and funny.

11:12.838 --> 11:15.636
What I always admired about you, your wit.

11:16.709 --> 11:19.678
- You're a prick, Andy.
- I always was.

11:22.748 --> 11:25.512
- So, let's see if there're any left.
- What?

11:27.486 --> 11:28.646
<i>Cojones.</i>

11:29.555 --> 11:32.023
Well, you need money. So do I.
Let's solve it.

11:32.124 --> 11:36.356
- What are you talking about?
- Well, there's a place we can knock off.

11:37.163 --> 11:40.963
Know it like the back of our hand.
Easiest money you'll ever get.

11:46.906 --> 11:48.601
What are you saying?

11:49.041 --> 11:51.373
It's worth about 600 grand.

11:52.578 --> 11:55.012
And it's insured, so it's a victimless crime.

11:55.114 --> 11:57.947
I offer that in case
your faggoty little conscience bothers you.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.712
I weigh it off on 20 cents on the dollar.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.583
That's 60 grand each.

12:03.823 --> 12:05.188
Give or take.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.354
I can't believe this is you that's talking.

12:10.463 --> 12:11.794
Believe it.

12:12.331 --> 12:16.961
So, it's safe, nobody gets hurt,
everybody wins. It's perfect.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.393
Why?

12:22.408 --> 12:23.807
What do...

12:24.210 --> 12:26.770
- Do you need money?
- Of course, I need money. But this is...

12:26.879 --> 12:29.848
This is serious crime, Andy. I'm not
a serious crime kind of a guy. I got a kid...

12:29.949 --> 12:31.507
You've got shit.

12:32.284 --> 12:34.548
You have a whole lot of shit.
You said so yourself.

12:34.653 --> 12:36.587
All the time. Every day.

12:41.193 --> 12:44.594
You know what?
It's not as serious as you might think.

12:45.998 --> 12:48.694
You're my little brother. Now, trust me.

12:53.672 --> 12:54.969
God, Andy.

12:57.643 --> 12:58.667
That's why you called me up?

12:58.778 --> 12:59.972
That's why you wanted
to spend the night together,

13:00.079 --> 13:02.411
- talk me into something crazy?
- That's why I called you up.

13:04.683 --> 13:06.776
Talk you into something crazy.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.987
Well, what's the place?

13:14.660 --> 13:17.220
No, not another word till you commit.

13:20.332 --> 13:21.390
Fuck.

13:22.635 --> 13:23.863
It's all right.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.832
So, how's the wife?

13:37.850 --> 13:39.112
Hey, Hank.

13:42.588 --> 13:44.522
Hey, I got an appointment.

13:44.623 --> 13:48.923
- I'll be back in a few, all right.
- Of course, you will. It's Thursday.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.537
- You're early.
- Well...

14:04.910 --> 14:08.437
You know my days are so busy.

14:15.154 --> 14:17.145
Just tell me that you'll think about it.

14:17.256 --> 14:20.282
But I thought about it already.
And I came to the conclusion

14:20.392 --> 14:22.053
that you're crazy.

14:22.761 --> 14:25.025
I'm going to go where with you?

14:25.831 --> 14:28.925
I mean, you've got child support.

14:29.568 --> 14:32.332
You've got Danielle's school,
you've got the rent...

14:34.373 --> 14:37.103
- The mortgage...
- Come on.

14:37.209 --> 14:41.043
...you're up to your ears in debt, Hank.
- I can solve all that. I know I can.

14:42.548 --> 14:45.039
When are you going to grow up, Hank?

14:45.918 --> 14:48.386
We have a really good thing going,

14:49.021 --> 14:50.818
and you should just enjoy it.

14:50.923 --> 14:54.654
We have a really good time in bed.
I don't ask for anything.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.251
I love you. I want more.

15:00.299 --> 15:03.393
So does Oliver Twist.

15:07.973 --> 15:09.998
Can I help you to seconds?

15:11.243 --> 15:14.906
Or do you really, really, really
have to get back?

15:20.219 --> 15:21.243
Huh?

15:23.088 --> 15:25.818
"The weight of this sad time we must obey.

15:25.925 --> 15:29.053
"Speak what we feel
and not what we ought to say.

15:33.198 --> 15:35.166
"The oldest hath borne most.

15:35.267 --> 15:37.599
"We that are young shall never see so much,

15:37.703 --> 15:39.398
"nor live so long."

15:45.811 --> 15:48.302
Bravo! Bravo!

15:54.386 --> 15:58.447
You were great. I'm so proud of you.

15:58.557 --> 16:00.320
You were wonderful.

16:00.426 --> 16:02.826
Grandpa and I thought you were wonderful.

16:02.928 --> 16:06.056
Excuse me, I'm sorry. It's just...
I have to have your autograph.

16:06.165 --> 16:07.632
- Dad. No.
- What, you were incredible.

16:07.733 --> 16:09.166
- No, stop it.
- What?

16:09.268 --> 16:11.793
- I messed up some of my lines.
- No, you didn't. I didn't notice.

16:11.904 --> 16:13.098
- Did you notice?
- I didn't notice at all.

16:13.205 --> 16:15.230
Honey, you were great. What?

16:15.341 --> 16:17.809
<i>Mom, can I go see The Lion King
this weekend?</i>

16:17.910 --> 16:21.437
- There's a class trip, everyone's going.
- Did you ask your father?

16:21.981 --> 16:24.347
- Can I, Dad?
- Yeah, sure. I got some money.

16:24.450 --> 16:26.475
Well, it's $130.

16:26.585 --> 16:30.681
But we're staying overnight
and that includes hotel and everything.

16:34.727 --> 16:35.751
Okay, great. Yeah.

16:59.051 --> 17:01.645
- Yeah.
- Hey, man. Can I talk to you?

17:01.754 --> 17:04.551
<i>Where are you?
- I'm down the hall, by the coffee.</i>

17:04.656 --> 17:07.557
<i>- How about my office, 30 seconds?
All right.</i>

17:10.295 --> 17:13.458
Hank, the super at 111 Riverside
says the boiler's really kaput.

17:13.565 --> 17:16.193
He needs you to... Hello?

17:35.087 --> 17:36.076
So?

17:39.625 --> 17:43.026
- That place that you were talking about.
- What place?

17:43.128 --> 17:45.858
- The one that we were going to...
- To knock off?

17:45.964 --> 17:47.022
Yeah.

17:47.332 --> 17:48.492
To rob?

17:49.201 --> 17:50.532
You say it.

17:51.603 --> 17:53.161
Tell me about it.

17:53.338 --> 17:54.999
I'm not going to tell you about it
until you say you're in

17:55.107 --> 17:57.803
and once you say it, there's no way out.

18:04.750 --> 18:05.876
I'm in.

18:08.954 --> 18:10.785
Let me see your hands.

18:12.991 --> 18:15.619
- Just say it again, "I'm in."
- What're you talking about?

18:15.727 --> 18:17.319
Just say it again, "I'm in."

18:17.429 --> 18:18.589
I'm in.

18:22.968 --> 18:24.060
What?

18:24.403 --> 18:26.803
I just wanted to see if you were pulling
any of that chickenshit baby stuff

18:26.905 --> 18:27.894
like when we were kids, you know,

18:28.006 --> 18:29.530
"It doesn't count.
I had my fingers crossed."

18:29.641 --> 18:32.007
I'm in. What're we doing?

18:32.111 --> 18:34.944
- And when?
- It's a jewelry store.

18:35.747 --> 18:37.510
- Does this ring a bell?
- No.

18:38.217 --> 18:40.185
What if I tell you it's got

18:40.285 --> 18:44.312
a Foot Locker on one side
and a Claire's Accessories on the other.

18:49.728 --> 18:52.697
Yeah, that's right. You got it. Now, listen.

18:54.399 --> 18:57.926
We don't want Tiffany's.
We want a Mom and Pop operation,

18:58.670 --> 19:00.262
in a busy place,

19:00.606 --> 19:03.871
on a Saturday
when the week's takes go in the safe.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.342
We both worked there.
We know the safe combinations.

19:06.445 --> 19:09.812
We know the burglar alarm signals.
We know where everything is.

19:09.915 --> 19:13.248
I figure, between the week's take,

19:13.352 --> 19:16.913
the jewelry and the cases,
the vault, there's a $500,000 haul.

19:17.022 --> 19:18.887
I figure probably six.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.551
That old dumb old lady that works there,
she's alone till noon.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.924
She's not going to be a problem.

19:27.032 --> 19:28.056
Andy.

19:28.867 --> 19:29.925
Yeah?

19:31.203 --> 19:33.262
That's Mom and Dad's store.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.335
That's what I said.

19:37.776 --> 19:39.710
A Mom and Pop operation.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.714
- You can't do that.
- Yeah, we can. Think about it.

19:44.816 --> 19:46.613
It's perfect. It's perfect.

19:46.718 --> 19:48.413
In and out in a minute.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.353
Insurance takes care of Mom and Dad,
so they're not hurt. Right?

19:51.456 --> 19:53.924
No one's going to give a shit.
After a week the cops

19:54.026 --> 19:58.053
- will put it in the back of the filing cabinet.
- Jesus, Andy. I...

19:58.263 --> 20:00.754
Why did you even want me in on this?

20:01.900 --> 20:05.028
Well, it'll solve everything for both of us.

20:05.237 --> 20:07.432
What has to be solved for you?

20:08.340 --> 20:10.535
Same as you. I need money.
I'm going to start over again.

20:10.642 --> 20:12.576
What do you mean?

20:12.678 --> 20:14.737
What the fuck kind of...
It's none of your business.

20:14.846 --> 20:17.440
I just want out. I just want to... That's all.

20:17.549 --> 20:20.712
I'm getting out,
I want to help my little brother.

20:21.853 --> 20:23.013
Come on.

20:24.890 --> 20:25.948
Yeah.

20:26.658 --> 20:28.853
No, I don't think I can do this.
I don't think I can...

20:28.961 --> 20:32.397
Yeah, you can. Yeah, you can.

20:33.031 --> 20:34.259
I just...

20:40.005 --> 20:41.438
That's $2,000.

20:46.945 --> 20:48.469
It's an advance.

20:49.648 --> 20:51.946
See what just that much does for you.

20:53.051 --> 20:54.040
And,

20:55.854 --> 20:57.446
imagine the rest.

21:08.600 --> 21:13.299
Five, six, seven, eight,
nine hundred dollars.

21:14.473 --> 21:15.565
You still owe me May and June.

21:15.674 --> 21:18.404
Yeah, Monday. All right.
Everything on Monday.

21:18.510 --> 21:19.772
- That's what I said.
- Such a loser.

21:19.878 --> 21:21.368
You're such a fucking loser.

21:21.480 --> 21:22.606
I come over here with $900.

21:22.714 --> 21:25.342
- Yeah, well, if it was for me, maybe.
- And I'm the fucking... All right.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.917
- May and June, asshole.
- Bye, bye, bye.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.008
Danielle, dinner.

21:28.954 --> 21:32.048
No, please don't put me on... Jesus.

21:32.157 --> 21:33.556
- Yo, Bobby.
- What's going on?

21:33.659 --> 21:35.627
- Hey, here, let me buy you a drink.
- I'm working.

21:35.727 --> 21:39.128
- I ain't loaning you no more money.
- No, come on, man. I'm flush.

21:39.231 --> 21:40.858
- You don't exactly...
- Yeah, something like that.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.490
Look, you just...
If you're free tomorrow morning,

21:42.601 --> 21:44.694
I got a proposition for you.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.764
- Later.
- All right.

21:51.576 --> 21:53.703
- What if there is a security guard?
- There isn't.

21:53.812 --> 21:57.475
- Why?
- No, it's a Mom and Pop place.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.445
Who ever heard
of a Mom and Pop jewelry store?

22:00.552 --> 22:02.747
- What the fuck is that?
- It's in the suburbs, all right.

22:02.888 --> 22:04.685
It's not in the city.

22:07.359 --> 22:08.758
I don't know.

22:10.228 --> 22:13.356
We drive out there, we check it out,
if anything looks off,

22:13.465 --> 22:15.626
you know, we just drive away.

22:16.234 --> 22:18.429
We say, "Fuck it,"
we drive our happy asses home

22:18.537 --> 22:20.630
and I keep the money anyway.

22:21.873 --> 22:23.204
Yeah, fine.

22:23.542 --> 22:25.533
You keep the money anyway.

22:30.449 --> 22:32.383
- Hanson?
- Yeah, that's me.

22:32.484 --> 22:33.746
All right.

22:57.242 --> 22:58.436
- Yeah.
- Bobby, for Christ's sakes,

22:58.543 --> 22:59.532
- Bobby, we got to go.
- Just come on in.

22:59.644 --> 23:01.635
I just got to throw on some clothes.
It'll only take a second.

23:01.747 --> 23:02.873
We got to go.

23:02.981 --> 23:05.211
- Just give me a second.
- God damn it.

23:06.651 --> 23:09.518
Jesus Christ, Bobby, it's so fucking early.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.982
Boo wakes up, you fucking sit up with him.

23:13.091 --> 23:16.618
- I told you it was work.
- I don't give a fuck what it is.

23:18.663 --> 23:21.427
Chris ain't used to getting up this early.

23:24.269 --> 23:25.600
Oh, Christ.

23:27.038 --> 23:29.302
Come on, babe. Here.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.535
- Thank you, baby.
- Yeah, just keep it down, okay?

23:31.643 --> 23:32.837
You wake Boo up, I'll kick your ass.

23:32.944 --> 23:34.809
- All right.
- Yours, too.

23:36.948 --> 23:38.347
All right.

23:41.820 --> 23:43.014
Come on.

23:47.559 --> 23:49.424
All right, let's do it.

24:37.075 --> 24:38.736
Are we there?
- No.

25:02.767 --> 25:04.064
All right.

25:06.304 --> 25:08.169
Who the fuck are you supposed to be?

25:08.273 --> 25:10.867
Look, I used to work there, all right.
I used to work there

25:10.976 --> 25:13.740
and I can't take a chance
on being recognized. Don't... Look...

25:15.380 --> 25:18.577
- You ain't never done this before, huh?
- Yeah, so?

25:18.683 --> 25:21.117
I got to tell you something,
you look like a fucking asshole.

25:21.219 --> 25:24.711
- Yeah, all right, look...
- I'm going to do this on my own.

25:24.823 --> 25:27.553
- Really?
- You do the driving, I do the thing, all right.

25:27.659 --> 25:30.890
- What if you need help?
- I got all the help I need.

25:32.397 --> 25:33.955
There's no shooting.

25:34.065 --> 25:36.158
- I ain't looking for it.
- There's no shooting.

25:36.268 --> 25:37.929
- You do the driving.
- Hey.

25:38.036 --> 25:39.298
- I do the thing.
- No shooting.

25:39.404 --> 25:41.634
You ain't got the balls to do the thing.
I got the balls

25:41.740 --> 25:43.901
- and I got a gun. That's the deal.
- Listen, no shooting.

25:44.009 --> 25:46.603
- Or else I'm leaving right now.
- Hey, no!

25:46.711 --> 25:48.542
Just no shooting, okay?

26:01.059 --> 26:02.959
Okay. Ten more minutes.

26:10.602 --> 26:12.263
What the fuck is this?

26:12.370 --> 26:14.133
You can listen to that faggoty shit
all the way home.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.867
Right now, I got to get into character.

26:16.975 --> 26:18.567
- Right?
- Okay.

27:11.496 --> 27:12.554
Okay.

27:13.264 --> 27:14.595
This is it.

27:15.600 --> 27:16.828
You ready?

27:18.870 --> 27:22.567
Car out front. Door open.
I jump back in. You take off.

27:22.674 --> 27:24.767
- Simple as a pimple, all right.
- Right.

27:24.876 --> 27:26.241
- Right?
- Right.

27:26.344 --> 27:28.278
- Let's do it.
- All right.

29:16.654 --> 29:20.215
Yes, hi, hello.
Is Andrew Hanson available, please?

29:23.128 --> 29:24.117
Uh...

29:26.798 --> 29:30.859
Mooney. Mooney.
Okay, yeah, tell him it's Mooney.

29:33.738 --> 29:35.501
<i>- Yeah.
There's a Mr. Mooney on line two.</i>

29:35.607 --> 29:37.302
<i>- He sounds like some nut case.
- Okay.</i>

29:37.408 --> 29:39.706
<i>- But...
- All right, I'll take it.</i>

29:43.348 --> 29:44.838
It just came apart, Andy.

29:45.884 --> 29:47.476
<i>Oh, my God, Andy.</i>

29:48.686 --> 29:50.779
<i>What the fuck am I gonna do?</i>

29:59.631 --> 30:02.498
No, honey, no, don't worry.
It's just some mistake.

30:04.035 --> 30:05.730
It's either the bank's or mine.

30:07.205 --> 30:10.572
Maybe I didn't put enough money
in the joint account.

30:11.743 --> 30:13.973
Yeah. No. Listen, don't worry.

30:14.078 --> 30:17.514
Of course, we have the cash.
I'll call, I'll take care of it. Okay?

30:19.250 --> 30:20.547
Yes, okay?

31:11.002 --> 31:12.162
- Andy?
- Yeah. Yeah.

31:12.270 --> 31:13.828
We're waiting for you
in the conference room.

31:13.938 --> 31:15.803
Okay, I'll be right in.

31:24.883 --> 31:25.850
Jesus.

31:27.652 --> 31:29.142
Okay, next.

31:29.254 --> 31:31.017
The auditors.

31:31.122 --> 31:34.819
Some of you guys might have heard,
we're getting hit with an IRS audit.

31:34.926 --> 31:37.224
The auditors will be here on Monday.

31:37.328 --> 31:40.092
They'll spend a day or two
with each department.

31:40.198 --> 31:44.157
On Monday, they'll start with payroll,
so you're up first, Andy.

31:47.538 --> 31:50.905
Great. Great. No problem.

32:25.176 --> 32:26.404
How are you doing today, sir?

32:27.879 --> 32:28.903
Thanks a lot.

33:12.857 --> 33:14.017
Hungry?

33:17.128 --> 33:18.527
Have a drink.

33:19.931 --> 33:21.626
Right, tonic water.

36:32.156 --> 36:33.145
You know,

36:35.826 --> 36:38.522
the thing about real estate accounting
is that you can,

36:40.097 --> 36:42.759
you can head down the page
or across the page,

36:42.867 --> 36:47.099
and everything works out.
So, every day, everything adds up.

36:50.341 --> 36:53.970
Well, the total is always the sum of its parts.

36:55.246 --> 36:57.942
It's clean, it's clear, neat, absolute.

37:06.624 --> 37:09.320
But my life, it...

37:11.429 --> 37:13.624
It doesn't add up. It's...

37:17.668 --> 37:20.660
Nothing connects to anything else. It's...

37:24.842 --> 37:27.072
I'm not the sum of my parts.

37:32.350 --> 37:35.046
All of my parts don't add up to one...

37:40.758 --> 37:42.453
To one me, I guess.

37:43.828 --> 37:45.693
Get a shrink or a wife.

37:48.132 --> 37:50.225
- I got a wife.
- Get a shrink.

38:06.550 --> 38:08.245
Excuse me. Sorry.

38:15.426 --> 38:17.053
Was it me, honey?

38:18.596 --> 38:20.723
What difference does it make?

38:21.065 --> 38:22.930
It's another strikeout.

38:24.935 --> 38:27.768
I swear it would make a lot of difference.

38:29.940 --> 38:32.238
- You're all I want.
- Yeah, well...

38:34.578 --> 38:37.138
I'm a lousy cook. The house looks like shit.

38:37.248 --> 38:40.547
I'm a lousy lay,
I don't know why you wanna keep me.

38:45.923 --> 38:47.618
You weren't in Rio.

38:49.427 --> 38:50.917
I wasn't what?

38:51.696 --> 38:52.993
Lousy lay.

39:00.204 --> 39:03.002
Well, like you said, just blame it on Rio.

39:10.314 --> 39:12.373
Suppose I could get us back there.

39:12.483 --> 39:13.541
What?

39:14.752 --> 39:15.776
Rio.

39:17.254 --> 39:19.222
- To live?
- Absolutely.

39:22.626 --> 39:25.459
- You're just crazy. Crazy.
- No. It's not crazy.

39:25.563 --> 39:29.055
The real estate market's booming in Rio.
There's a lot of new money.

39:29.734 --> 39:31.497
And they're going to want
the same as Europeans, Arabs,

39:31.602 --> 39:36.039
everybody wants real estate in New York,
in America and I know the market here.

39:36.140 --> 39:38.540
You don't even speak the language.

39:43.114 --> 39:46.675
I'll fucking learn it. Jesus Christ.

39:50.154 --> 39:51.587
You know when...

39:52.790 --> 39:57.853
When you met me, my biggest prospect
was inheriting a Mom and Pop jewelry store

39:57.962 --> 40:00.863
in a fucking shopping mall in Westchester.

40:02.333 --> 40:05.325
Now, I know it's not Trump Plaza, and...

40:06.837 --> 40:09.806
But just take a look at how we're living now.

40:10.441 --> 40:12.204
Now, I took that lousy job in that,

40:12.309 --> 40:15.369
that real estate office,
I was practically a fucking gofer,

40:15.479 --> 40:18.607
and I'm pulling down six figures now.
I'm smart.

40:21.085 --> 40:22.712
I know the angles.

40:23.988 --> 40:25.353
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

40:26.857 --> 40:28.188
I bet you do.

40:29.059 --> 40:30.720
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

40:30.828 --> 40:33.160
Well, because there is
no extradition agreement

40:33.264 --> 40:35.789
between Brazil and the United States.

40:37.334 --> 40:38.631
How the...

40:38.736 --> 40:40.761
How the hell do you know that?

40:40.871 --> 40:42.702
I saw it in a movie.

40:45.676 --> 40:48.167
Yeah, I guess I saw the same movie.

40:53.484 --> 40:55.748
So, what are you thinking?
What are you thinking?

40:55.853 --> 40:58.413
What are you thinking?
What are you thinking?

40:58.522 --> 41:00.353
Don't ask, don't tell.

41:03.027 --> 41:05.359
I just want us to get back there.

41:07.198 --> 41:10.827
I've seen Heaven, Gina,
it's a nice place to stay.

41:10.935 --> 41:13.768
- Okay? All right?
- Uh-huh.

41:21.512 --> 41:24.879
- What language do they speak there?
- Portuguese.

41:27.451 --> 41:29.817
I speak a little Spanish.

41:31.255 --> 41:35.055
That's... I'm sorry, sweetheart,
that's not the same language.

41:35.759 --> 41:37.556
- Yes, it is.
- I'm sorry, it's not.

41:37.661 --> 41:40.425
- Yes, it is. Yes, it is.
- No.

41:40.531 --> 41:42.431
<i>- Yes, it is.
- Cómo se llama?</i>

41:43.734 --> 41:45.861
<i>- Me llamo...
- Cómo? Me llamo...</i>

41:47.338 --> 41:48.430
Gina.

42:31.715 --> 42:33.478
Why'd you come to me?

42:33.817 --> 42:36.047
I know you from way back,
I know what you do.

42:36.153 --> 42:37.586
You're a cop.

42:38.155 --> 42:40.783
No, I'm not a cop,
I just want to make sure you're still around.

42:40.891 --> 42:43.451
I'll bring you what I've got soon,
either you take it or you don't.

42:43.561 --> 42:44.823
But I know you will.

42:44.929 --> 42:47.056
You could work for the cops.

42:47.965 --> 42:49.398
Check me out.

42:51.936 --> 42:53.369
I'll be back.

43:01.779 --> 43:03.269
That's $2,000.

43:09.253 --> 43:10.811
It's an advance.

43:12.790 --> 43:15.350
See what just that much does for you,

43:16.393 --> 43:18.884
and imagine the rest.

43:36.680 --> 43:39.808
- Yeah, so how do we start? Oh, fuck.
- It's

43:39.917 --> 43:41.544
not we, you.

43:41.652 --> 43:43.085
Me?

43:43.187 --> 43:46.953
What the hell do I know
about robbing a jewelry store?

43:47.057 --> 43:50.925
You'll learn it there.
On-the-job training, you know.

43:52.730 --> 43:54.288
Cut it out, man, this is serious.

43:54.398 --> 43:58.459
You know, I'm serious as a heart attack.
Listen, number one, I can't...

43:58.569 --> 44:01.037
- I can't go up to the mall.
- Why not?

44:01.138 --> 44:02.400
Oh God, three months ago,

44:02.506 --> 44:04.997
I had to walk the whole goddamn area
with a Home Depot representative,

44:05.109 --> 44:06.576
'cause they were thinking of buying up
a lot of space.

44:06.677 --> 44:08.008
We own a lot of land in the mall,

44:08.112 --> 44:10.637
and I'm getting a lot of big handshakes.
"Andy, baby, how are you?

44:10.748 --> 44:11.806
"I haven't seen you in so long
since you left."

44:11.915 --> 44:14.850
And telling me all that bullshit
because they figure I'm making a killing,

44:14.952 --> 44:17.284
because a big chain wants to buy them out.

44:17.388 --> 44:20.915
I'm saying someone's going to
just recognize me too easy.

44:21.859 --> 44:23.759
So we postpone, just...

44:24.428 --> 44:28.023
Yeah, we could, you know, wait a year.

44:31.535 --> 44:34.504
I mean, I don't know about you,
my problems are pressing.

44:34.605 --> 44:38.166
Jesus, Andy, I... Andy!

44:38.676 --> 44:41.645
- I wouldn't even know how to start, I mean.
- Well, you can stop being a baby.

44:41.745 --> 44:43.372
- I'm not being a...
- Yeah, you're being a baby.

44:43.480 --> 44:46.972
Get a gun.
You get a toy gun in a kid's store.

44:47.084 --> 44:50.019
Right, that old lady that works on Saturday,
what's her name?

44:50.120 --> 44:52.111
- Doris?
- Yeah, Doris, Mom's friend.

44:52.222 --> 44:55.953
She's what, 60, 70? She's blind as a bat?

44:56.060 --> 44:57.891
Look at me. Blind as a bat.

44:58.328 --> 45:01.354
All right, those toy guns,
they look so real, they fool cops all the time.

45:01.465 --> 45:03.126
All right, you go in at 8:00 a.m.,
just as she opens up.

45:03.233 --> 45:05.793
You put her old ass in the back room,
you empty the vault,

45:05.903 --> 45:09.361
the cash, the trays
and you dump it in a fucking sack.

45:09.707 --> 45:12.676
All right. You don't gotta be neat about it.

45:14.978 --> 45:19.574
Jesus, Andy, I don't know.
I don't know, I don't... I...

45:19.683 --> 45:21.116
I don't know.

45:27.257 --> 45:29.418
Okay. Come on.

45:34.298 --> 45:35.788
You can do it.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.490
You can do it.

45:39.136 --> 45:40.535
Anybody can.

45:42.306 --> 45:45.764
- I just think...
- I know, I know. It's too late to think.

45:47.845 --> 45:49.335
It's too late.

45:50.080 --> 45:52.878
This is our future.

46:01.024 --> 46:02.116
Okay.

46:18.075 --> 46:20.168
<i>- Yeah.
There's a Mr. Mooney on line two.</i>

46:20.277 --> 46:22.472
<i>He sounds like some nut case. But...</i>

46:22.579 --> 46:24.069
Okay, I got it.

46:27.217 --> 46:29.185
It just came apart, Andy.

46:31.021 --> 46:32.386
Oh, my God, Andy.

46:35.893 --> 46:37.986
<i>What the fuck am I gonna do?</i>

46:40.531 --> 46:41.555
Could he be in a different wing?

46:41.665 --> 46:44.293
If you just pipe down a second, sir,
I'm trying to help you.

46:44.401 --> 46:45.868
- What are you doing here?
- Keep quiet one minute.

46:45.969 --> 46:47.698
Dad called me, all right. I just got here.

46:47.805 --> 46:50.205
- This lady, she doesn't...
- Look, Miss, our father... I got it.

46:50.307 --> 46:53.902
- I got it. I know, but you might...
- I told him, we've got no Charles Hanson.

46:54.011 --> 46:56.605
Wait a minute, I got a Nanette Hanson.

46:57.881 --> 47:00.372
- What?
- There's a Nanette Hanson.

47:00.484 --> 47:03.180
- Brought in about three hours ago.
- What?

47:04.688 --> 47:06.178
Gunshot wounds.

47:07.524 --> 47:10.084
- Where is she?
- Emergency ICU.

47:10.194 --> 47:14.893
Hey. Now. Hey, hold it.
Wait, are you related? Sir? Are you?

47:20.337 --> 47:21.361
Dad?

47:29.680 --> 47:31.307
She's unconscious.

47:32.916 --> 47:34.247
And they...

47:35.552 --> 47:36.712
She's...

47:38.822 --> 47:39.914
They...

47:41.391 --> 47:42.722
They say...

48:00.010 --> 48:01.602
<i>So, how are you feeling?</i>

48:01.712 --> 48:03.304
Yeah, I feel old.

48:04.781 --> 48:07.716
I've been studying all week,
and I can't retain a thing.

48:07.818 --> 48:10.810
<i>Come on, you're going to pass
with flying colors, Dad.</i>

48:10.921 --> 48:15.119
That's how I'm going to spend my birthday,
taking that stupid test.

48:15.225 --> 48:16.453
Have you spoken to your brothers?

48:18.195 --> 48:19.492
Few weeks ago.

48:19.596 --> 48:21.757
<i>Yeah? How are they?</i>

48:24.067 --> 48:25.728
Busy.

48:25.836 --> 48:29.203
You know, Dad,
Hank is Hank and Andy's Andy.

48:31.475 --> 48:35.036
No more cramming, birthday boy.
It's the moment of truth.

48:36.647 --> 48:38.945
What time is Doris coming to the store?

48:39.049 --> 48:41.108
She said 12:00 at the latest.

48:41.218 --> 48:43.778
She has to baby-sit for her daughter.

48:44.421 --> 48:46.981
I'll pick you up right after my test.

48:49.226 --> 48:50.750
Come on, come on.

48:51.328 --> 48:53.660
All right, all right, all right.

49:09.513 --> 49:11.981
- Perfect score, Mr. Hanson.
- Bingo!

49:13.884 --> 49:15.442
Congratulations.

49:16.186 --> 49:18.586
If you'll take this to Window C,

49:19.823 --> 49:21.222
they'll give you the eye test.

49:21.925 --> 49:24.621
I might not do so well on that one.

49:24.728 --> 49:28.164
- I've been studying hard, of course. Thanks.
- All right.

49:59.429 --> 50:01.397
That's my store!

50:02.232 --> 50:04.257
- What happened? What's happening?
Let's go!

50:04.368 --> 50:06.165
- Sir, sir, just stay behind the yellow line.
- What's happening?

50:06.269 --> 50:07.964
- I want to know what's happening.
- Behind the yellow line.

50:08.071 --> 50:10.596
- Where's my wife? Where's my wife?
- Calm down. Please calm down.

50:46.376 --> 50:47.707
I love you.

50:56.953 --> 51:02.357
There are more tests we can do, but from
what we've seen so far, it's very unlikely.

51:03.493 --> 51:05.290
There's no brain activity.

51:05.395 --> 51:09.661
And statistically speaking,
there's very little chance for recovery.

51:15.405 --> 51:17.134
Why was Mom working?

51:18.408 --> 51:21.206
I thought she didn't work at the store
anymore, that's what Katherine told me.

51:21.311 --> 51:25.941
Doris had to baby-sit, I had to get down
to the DMV, get my eyes tested.

51:28.785 --> 51:30.548
Today's my birthday.

51:31.822 --> 51:33.551
Where's your brother?

51:38.528 --> 51:39.586
He...

51:41.765 --> 51:44.700
He says he can't take it. To let him know if...

51:44.801 --> 51:48.066
If he can help,
but he just can't see her like that.

52:32.115 --> 52:33.742
He's 28 years old.

52:34.718 --> 52:36.811
He's a goddamn punk from Red Hook.

52:36.920 --> 52:40.856
Red Hook. What was he doing up here?
What in the fucking world? What he...

52:40.957 --> 52:44.290
I mean, did he put a map on the wall
and throw a dart?

52:47.998 --> 52:51.866
It's so absurd. It's so goddamn arbitrary.

52:53.170 --> 52:54.762
Why me? Why her?

52:55.138 --> 52:57.698
What was this goddamn kid doing?

52:59.709 --> 53:01.404
You belong in hell.

53:03.580 --> 53:05.878
Yeah. I understand. All right. Thank you.

53:06.516 --> 53:09.144
Look, it might be better if you call,
make an appointment?

53:09.252 --> 53:11.083
Well, I'd rather wait.

53:12.622 --> 53:15.216
Please. Steve...

53:50.860 --> 53:51.884
Dad.

53:54.598 --> 53:56.964
You have to make a decision, Dad.

54:00.370 --> 54:01.735
The gun was bought in Texas.

54:01.838 --> 54:05.239
Stolen Texas driver's license, his ID, fake,

54:06.876 --> 54:10.141
the gun turns up in New York, a year later.

54:10.247 --> 54:13.045
- Mom needs you to make a decision, Dad.
- Andy, just leave him alone.

54:13.149 --> 54:15.014
Well, something has to be done,
he has to make a decision.

54:15.118 --> 54:16.745
Just leave him to his grief for one minute.

54:16.853 --> 54:20.311
- Mom is in the hands of Jesus.
- Now, will you cut it out with that crap?

54:20.423 --> 54:22.687
You shouldn't push Dad to make a decision
he doesn't wanna make.

54:22.792 --> 54:24.350
Well, he has to make a decision.

54:31.635 --> 54:33.125
Hey, Patrick.

55:28.525 --> 55:30.959
We know it's difficult, Mr. Hanson.

55:54.284 --> 55:55.615
Let her go.

56:01.925 --> 56:03.290
Let her go.

56:06.429 --> 56:07.828
Let her go.

56:12.936 --> 56:15.461
"Almighty and ever living God.

56:15.572 --> 56:20.669
"Remember the mercy with which you
graced your daughter, Nanette, in this life.

56:20.777 --> 56:25.578
"Receive her, we pray,
into the mansions of the saints.

56:25.682 --> 56:29.083
"As we make ready
our sister's resting place

56:29.185 --> 56:32.450
"Look also with favor on those who mourn.

56:32.889 --> 56:35.414
"And comfort them in their loss.

56:35.925 --> 56:40.055
"Because God has chosen
to call Nanette from this life,

56:40.797 --> 56:45.666
"commit her body to the earth,
for we are dust and to dust we shall return."

56:45.769 --> 56:48.670
I'm so sorry for your loss.
She was a wonderful person.

56:49.706 --> 56:50.866
- She was a wonderful woman.
- Yes.

56:50.974 --> 56:54.034
- I'm so sorry.
- You have my deepest condolences.

56:54.377 --> 56:56.038
She was a dear friend.

56:56.146 --> 56:57.841
So sorry for your loss,
your mother was a good person.

56:57.947 --> 56:59.414
I'm so sorry.

57:00.517 --> 57:01.984
God bless you.

57:03.186 --> 57:06.087
There's no way I can make this scene, Andy.

57:08.858 --> 57:10.849
He was always such a baby.

57:25.608 --> 57:26.597
Yeah.

57:31.114 --> 57:32.775
I can't really talk right now.

57:34.617 --> 57:35.948
I can't, I...

57:36.052 --> 57:38.077
I have to go. Andy needs me.

58:31.341 --> 58:32.603
<i>22nd precinct.</i>

58:32.709 --> 58:34.677
Detective Barrett, please.

58:34.811 --> 58:36.506
<i>Just a moment, sir.</i>

58:39.616 --> 58:40.981
<i>I'm sorry, he's not in right now.</i>

58:41.084 --> 58:45.851
Is there anyone down there that knows
anything about the Nanette Hanson case?

58:45.955 --> 58:48.981
<i>- Who's speaking, please?
- Charles Hanson, yeah.</i>

58:50.894 --> 58:52.623
<i>Just a moment, sir.</i>

58:57.300 --> 58:58.961
<i>Sergeant Sullivan.</i>

58:59.068 --> 59:00.592
Yeah, good morning, Sergeant.

59:00.703 --> 59:04.867
I've been trying to reach Detective Barrett
but he doesn't return my calls.

59:04.974 --> 59:06.407
<i>Would you like to leave a message, sir?</i>

59:06.509 --> 59:09.535
No, I wouldn't like to leave
another message.

59:09.646 --> 59:11.546
Doesn't anyone down there give a damn?

59:11.648 --> 59:13.513
Doesn't anyone down there
work for a living?

59:13.616 --> 59:15.914
<i>Would you like to leave a message, sir?</i>

01:00:21.718 --> 01:00:23.345
Don't you know
how important this is to me?

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:25.114
I know, I just...

01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:28.418
You know, I thought
I was going to be able to work it out, but...

01:00:28.524 --> 01:00:30.958
But I couldn't get
the money together, you know.

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:33.494
All my friends think I'm going to be there,
what am I going to tell them?

01:00:33.596 --> 01:00:36.156
You know, I mean,
there's going to be other field trips.

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:38.199
<i>Not to The Lion King, there won't.</i>

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:40.963
Look, Dad, if you weren't going to pay for it,
you should have just said so

01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:44.528
and saved me the humiliation of having
to tell all my friends that you're a loser.

01:01:17.106 --> 01:01:20.598
<i>Hey, this is Hank. I must
be out, so leave a message at the beep.</i>

01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:24.036
I know you're there. Pick up the phone.

01:01:26.282 --> 01:01:27.943
<i>Pick up the phone.</i>

01:01:28.818 --> 01:01:31.787
<i>Pick up the fucking phone,
you fucking faggot.</i>

01:01:34.057 --> 01:01:36.617
- Andy, I'm here.
- Where have you been?

01:01:37.894 --> 01:01:40.260
Here. I called in sick.

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:44.932
And what the fuck were you doing
with that fucking asshole?

01:01:46.135 --> 01:01:48.433
<i>- I was scared, all right? So I...
- I didn't say anything about</i>

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:50.529
a fucking gun, God damn it.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.335
But we got to talk.

01:01:52.575 --> 01:01:53.542
Andy.

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:55.906
<i>Meet me at Mooney's.</i>

01:01:56.145 --> 01:01:57.840
You still can't get by? To see Mom?

01:01:58.414 --> 01:02:01.645
- What am I going to say?
- Don't say anything. Fuck.

01:02:02.285 --> 01:02:03.547
- Who else knows?
- Nobody.

01:02:03.653 --> 01:02:05.553
- You didn't tell anyone?
- No.

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:07.850
- No one saw you talking with Bobby?
- No.

01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:09.252
All right. Nobody saw you here?

01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:12.589
No, come on, it was crowded, it was busy.
No, no.

01:02:12.695 --> 01:02:14.458
- Did he rent the car with you?
- Did he what?

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:16.589
- Did he rent the fucking car with you?
- No, no, no.

01:02:16.699 --> 01:02:18.257
All right, did you...

01:02:18.367 --> 01:02:19.664
- You picked him up?
- Yeah.

01:02:19.769 --> 01:02:22.431
- At his house.
- Did anyone see you there, at his house?

01:02:22.705 --> 01:02:24.366
- Did anyone see you at his house?
- No, no.

01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:26.840
- Nobody saw you at the house?
- No.

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:33.808
Did you clean the car?
Did you wipe the car down?

01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:36.976
- Did you wipe the floor?
- Yeah, I totally... Totally, totally.

01:02:38.888 --> 01:02:42.324
- Did you leave anything in the car?
- No, of course not.

01:02:54.904 --> 01:02:56.667
We're probably okay.

01:02:58.007 --> 01:03:01.534
If they don't connect the car to us,
we're probably okay.

01:03:02.478 --> 01:03:04.605
That's what I was thinking.

01:03:05.314 --> 01:03:07.976
- Go back to work, totally normal.
- Okay.

01:03:10.353 --> 01:03:12.548
I'm so sorry, Andy. I'm sorry.

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:19.891
I don't think I can get through this.

01:03:19.996 --> 01:03:21.122
Shut up.

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:24.165
- I loved her so much.
- Just shut the fuck up.

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:30.669
If he had to take somebody out,
why couldn't it have been him?

01:03:47.023 --> 01:03:48.854
<i>One new message.</i>

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:52.826
<i>This is Mike Steuben calling
from Auto Rent for Mr. Henry Hanson.</i>

01:03:53.196 --> 01:03:55.790
<i>Mr. Hanson, you returned a car
the other day.</i>

01:03:55.898 --> 01:03:58.093
<i>It seems you forgot
some personal items in it.</i>

01:03:58.201 --> 01:04:03.571
<i>Please give me a call at 555-2649
and ask for Mike Steuben.</i>

01:04:03.806 --> 01:04:08.004
<i>Again, that number is 555-2649. Thank you.</i>

01:04:10.613 --> 01:04:12.103
<i>End of messages.</i>

01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:16.581
Okay. God.

01:04:20.456 --> 01:04:21.548
Okay.

01:04:23.659 --> 01:04:27.459
<i>Hello, you've reached
Auto Rent. Our office is currently closed.</i>

01:04:27.563 --> 01:04:28.587
<i>- Our business hours...
- Fuck.</i>

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:29.892
Fuck!

01:04:32.168 --> 01:04:35.228
Okay. All right. It's okay, it's okay.

01:04:49.318 --> 01:04:50.410
Excuse me?

01:04:50.753 --> 01:04:53.313
That's right, sir. It's $255 plus tax.

01:04:53.422 --> 01:04:56.687
But for an additional $17,
I could upgrade you to a luxury.

01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:58.383
Or, for... Yes.

01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:01.922
No, that's right,
the mid-size is $255 plus tax.

01:05:02.365 --> 01:05:05.596
Unless you'd like to upgrade to an SUV,
which I could offer you for 29...

01:05:05.701 --> 01:05:08.329
Excuse me, is Mike Steuben here?
No, I know, I'm just looking for Mike.

01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:10.200
So, would you like to upgrade to the SUV?

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:13.170
No, no. No, mid-size is fine, sir.

01:05:13.709 --> 01:05:14.869
No.

01:05:14.977 --> 01:05:16.877
Thank you for calling.

01:05:16.979 --> 01:05:17.946
I'm sorry.

01:05:18.314 --> 01:05:19.542
Good morning, how can I help you, sir?

01:05:19.649 --> 01:05:22.812
Yeah, I got a message from Mike Steuben.

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:25.649
Apparently I left something in a vehicle

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:28.121
that I returned last Saturday.
I think it was a CD.

01:05:28.224 --> 01:05:30.988
Oh, well, you would talk
to Mr. Steuben, then. He's the manager.

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:33.152
Yeah, I know, so could I speak with him?

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:35.230
I'm sorry, he's not here.
You'll have to come back.

01:05:36.432 --> 01:05:38.423
- When will he be in?
- I don't...

01:05:38.534 --> 01:05:39.933
He won't be in at all today.

01:05:40.036 --> 01:05:42.402
Well then, maybe you can help me.

01:05:42.505 --> 01:05:43.972
Oh, no. Sorry, sir.

01:05:44.073 --> 01:05:45.540
I'm sorry, excuse me.

01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:46.972
- Do you think...
- I'm sorry.

01:05:47.076 --> 01:05:49.636
- Will he be in tomorrow?
- Yes, Auto Rent.

01:05:49.745 --> 01:05:50.871
No, I...

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:54.741
No, I didn't say that, sir.
That's not up to me.

01:05:55.051 --> 01:05:56.040
No.

01:05:56.152 --> 01:05:58.814
Excuse me, can I get a beer? Thanks.

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:06.553
That's the guy, that's him.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:15.134
Yo, buddy.

01:06:16.939 --> 01:06:18.907
- This guy?
- Yeah.

01:06:20.042 --> 01:06:22.772
You were with Bobby Lasorda, Saturday?

01:06:23.446 --> 01:06:25.971
- What?
- I asked you a fucking question.

01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:28.613
What? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:31.644
- What's your name?
- I'm Hank.

01:06:31.754 --> 01:06:33.346
- Hank what?
- You know what?

01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:35.788
Come. Why don't you... Let's go.

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:38.392
Follow me, we can talk over here.

01:06:43.432 --> 01:06:45.059
- Come on. Have a seat.
- Is this all right?

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:46.691
Yeah, this is perfect.

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:48.470
So...

01:06:52.775 --> 01:06:54.834
What's the deal, huh?

01:06:54.944 --> 01:06:58.744
- My sister is quite all of a sudden a widow.
- Yeah.

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:01.248
She says you and Bobby had some work.

01:07:01.584 --> 01:07:02.573
Bobby said it was work.

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:05.711
Work that involved him
getting shot and killed,

01:07:05.821 --> 01:07:07.982
but not you getting shot and killed.

01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:10.149
No, I just got him the car.

01:07:10.259 --> 01:07:12.625
- I'm so sorry.
- What the fuck does that mean?

01:07:12.728 --> 01:07:16.664
Well, Bobby said that he needed
to rent a car, but that he...

01:07:16.766 --> 01:07:20.258
This was Friday night

01:07:20.369 --> 01:07:24.135
and he didn't have a credit card,
so I told him that I would rent him a car.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:28.176
And I owed him some money.
You know. That's it, I swear. It's...

01:07:28.577 --> 01:07:30.010
I'm so sorry.

01:07:30.479 --> 01:07:32.606
- So what? You're lying.
- No, I'm not.

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:35.309
Because if Bobby wanted a car,
he would have fucking stolen one.

01:07:35.418 --> 01:07:38.512
Chris, go fucking wait outside.

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:40.316
Let me handle this.

01:07:48.798 --> 01:07:50.663
You got a driver's license?

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:53.259
- A what?
- You know, the...

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:56.133
The driver's license you show
when you rent a car?

01:07:56.238 --> 01:07:57.364
Yeah.

01:07:57.473 --> 01:07:59.134
- Let me see it.
- Yeah.

01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:01.801
All right, sure.

01:08:02.378 --> 01:08:03.436
Here.

01:08:06.782 --> 01:08:09.012
- Henry Hanson.
- Yeah.

01:08:09.785 --> 01:08:11.082
This is your address, right?

01:08:12.254 --> 01:08:13.983
Yeah, sure.

01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:16.555
<i>I'm going to be straight with you, chico.</i>

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:19.053
<i>You mind if I call you chico?</i>

01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:20.787
People call me Hank.

01:08:20.895 --> 01:08:23.023
Bobby was a piece of shit.

01:08:23.131 --> 01:08:25.566
I know it, you know it. That's not the point.

01:08:25.667 --> 01:08:30.571
The point is that piece of shit
was the father of my sister's child.

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:33.136
And he was paying the bills.

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:34.402
And now he's dead.

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:37.843
And I'm thinking,
who's going to pay all these bills?

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.176
I'm so sorry.

01:08:40.282 --> 01:08:42.307
<i>Sorry ain't going to pay the bills, chico.</i>

01:08:42.417 --> 01:08:43.908
I know, I know.

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:48.578
We need to negotiate a settlement,
so make me an offer.

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:52.826
Ten grand, done. It's 10 grand.
I consider us even.

01:08:52.928 --> 01:08:54.919
If you don't like 10, I can make it 15.

01:08:55.029 --> 01:08:57.520
- No.
- My sister wants me to kill you.

01:08:59.335 --> 01:09:01.326
Or I could call the cops.

01:09:02.203 --> 01:09:03.728
But I don't like cops.

01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:06.899
And the cops ain't going to pay
my sister's bills.

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:11.041
So, I think a settlement
is pretty fair all-around.

01:09:15.251 --> 01:09:18.049
<i>- Day after tomorrow, chico.
- Can I?</i>

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:19.984
Here. 8:00.

01:09:26.127 --> 01:09:27.788
You fucking crazy?

01:09:27.897 --> 01:09:31.924
I was hoping that you had
something left over from the settlement.

01:09:34.569 --> 01:09:37.595
Lend you money? You owe me $2,000.

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.867
Shocked to shit you'd even ask.

01:09:39.975 --> 01:09:41.135
Martha,

01:09:44.246 --> 01:09:46.111
I'm in serious trouble.

01:09:47.082 --> 01:09:49.140
I don't give a shit
what kind of trouble you're in.

01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:52.515
The next time you show up here,
better be to pay me.

01:09:57.193 --> 01:09:59.593
Listen, tell Danielle I love her.

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:03.430
If you loved her,
you'd pay her fucking child support.

01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:43.965
I'm so sorry for your loss.
She was a wonderful person.

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:45.938
Wonderful woman.

01:10:46.642 --> 01:10:48.075
She was a wonderful woman.

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:52.046
God bless you.

01:10:55.017 --> 01:10:57.884
There's no way I can make this scene, Andy.

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:05.083
He was always such a baby.

01:11:19.241 --> 01:11:20.230
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:11:20.342 --> 01:11:23.368
- Hey, Gina.
- I can't really talk right now.

01:11:23.646 --> 01:11:25.341
<i>Andy needs me. I got to go.</i>

01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:26.880
Gina, Gina.

01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:36.851
Excuse me, is Mike Steuben here?

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:39.393
- Not till noon, can I help you?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:11:39.495 --> 01:11:43.397
I returned a car last Saturday
and I guess I forgot something.

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:45.126
Hanson?

01:11:45.467 --> 01:11:49.062
That's right, Hanson.
Yeah, and I'm pretty sure it was a CD.

01:11:49.171 --> 01:11:50.365
Hang on.

01:11:54.043 --> 01:11:55.908
Here we go, Mr. Hanson.

01:11:56.912 --> 01:11:59.380
- Great.
- I just need to see some ID.

01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:04.443
Yeah, you know, I...

01:12:04.787 --> 01:12:07.119
I lost my license.

01:12:08.624 --> 01:12:12.560
You have a credit card,
the one you used to rent the car with?

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:15.463
Yeah.

01:12:16.799 --> 01:12:18.926
- Yeah, this one.
- All right.

01:12:20.102 --> 01:12:21.831
Okay, great.

01:12:22.438 --> 01:12:24.269
- Thank you.
- Take care.

01:13:03.846 --> 01:13:05.871
<i>- Hello?
It's me.</i>

01:13:05.981 --> 01:13:08.745
Andy, Jesus! Fuck, man, we got problems.

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:37.470
<i>Hi, Andy.
This is Jake at the office.</i>

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:41.574
Really sorry to bother you,
but the auditors are coming tomorrow.

01:13:42.317 --> 01:13:44.478
<i>They've noticed a few problems.</i>

01:13:44.586 --> 01:13:47.919
<i>It's pretty urgent,
so give a call when you get this.</i>

01:13:50.359 --> 01:13:53.453
You're going to have to get
some sleep tonight.

01:13:56.865 --> 01:13:59.561
Have you given any thought to the store?

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:09.939
I mean, you're going to have to give it
some consideration. It's just gonna...

01:14:13.348 --> 01:14:17.444
I could open it up for you, you know,
while you're at the hospital.

01:14:17.719 --> 01:14:19.346
A few hours a day.

01:14:19.922 --> 01:14:22.254
So people know you're still there.

01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:28.459
I should burn the goddamn place down.

01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:41.067
Andy, this is Jake.

01:14:41.176 --> 01:14:44.304
Now I hope you're checking your messages
because we have a real mess here.

01:14:45.414 --> 01:14:48.247
<i>The auditors say that
there's two terminated employees</i>

01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:50.284
<i>from your department still drawing checks.</i>

01:14:50.385 --> 01:14:53.377
<i>And there's something about
unpaid OASDI taxes.</i>

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:55.882
<i>Look, you need to call us...</i>

01:15:00.596 --> 01:15:02.791
I got to go to the office tomorrow.

01:15:02.898 --> 01:15:06.959
There's a problem.
I'll go in the morning. I should be back later.

01:15:07.135 --> 01:15:08.329
Okay?

01:15:08.437 --> 01:15:11.065
His mother's dying,
and he's going back to work.

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:12.197
Yes!

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:25.809
Pick up the phone.

01:15:25.921 --> 01:15:27.718
I know you're there,
pick up the phone, you fucking faggot.

01:15:29.791 --> 01:15:31.418
Andy, I'm here.

01:15:32.828 --> 01:15:35.126
What are you doing here?
You don't have an appointment.

01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:37.494
- You know the deal, you can't just show up.
- I know, I'm sorry.

01:15:37.599 --> 01:15:39.999
Come back in an hour, tonic water.

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:16.203
My mom's dying.

01:16:18.807 --> 01:16:19.967
Bummer.

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:24.675
Next time, make an appointment.

01:16:41.496 --> 01:16:42.690
Stupid piece of shit.

01:16:42.798 --> 01:16:45.358
Stop talking to me like that.

01:16:45.467 --> 01:16:48.630
What the fuck?

01:16:50.505 --> 01:16:52.564
Are you going to get tough?

01:16:53.342 --> 01:16:55.207
Are you going to hurt me?

01:16:58.246 --> 01:16:59.577
Why was there even a gun?

01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:01.842
Why was there even a fucking gun?

01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:05.317
I gave you all the information you needed.
Why was Bobby Lasorda even there?

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:08.719
- Why the fuck?
- I didn't think I could do it alone.

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:18.526
I should fucking kill you.

01:17:29.378 --> 01:17:33.508
How are we going to fix it
so your shit don't fall on my shoes?

01:17:36.284 --> 01:17:38.047
So, think now, who else knows?

01:17:39.221 --> 01:17:41.280
"Commit her body to the earth.

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:44.359
"For we are dust and to dust we shall return.

01:17:45.027 --> 01:17:49.555
"But the Lord Jesus will change
our mortal bodies to be like his in glory.

01:17:50.399 --> 01:17:53.129
"So let us commend our sister to the Lord."

01:18:13.221 --> 01:18:15.985
She hated it when I barbecued.

01:18:42.084 --> 01:18:46.214
I'm sorry I wasn't able to be
what you wanted me to be.

01:18:47.923 --> 01:18:50.915
I've never been very good
at talking about feelings

01:18:51.026 --> 01:18:54.860
or showing you
that kind of affection or support.

01:18:58.467 --> 01:18:59.729
I'm sorry.

01:19:01.436 --> 01:19:04.234
I wasn't able to be the father you wanted.

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:09.806
But I guess I wanted you
to be better than me.

01:19:10.512 --> 01:19:12.742
And I thought that if I push...

01:19:18.854 --> 01:19:22.449
It may not mean anything to you,
but I want you to know

01:19:24.025 --> 01:19:26.016
that I really do love you.

01:19:29.297 --> 01:19:31.322
And I'm... I'm sorry.

01:19:34.536 --> 01:19:35.628
I'm just so sorry.

01:19:35.737 --> 01:19:38.638
I'm sorry I wasn't able to be
the son you wanted.

01:19:41.476 --> 01:19:43.535
You did the best you could.

01:19:45.847 --> 01:19:47.280
Still, yeah.

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:50.111
Manage to seem to still like Hank.

01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:53.083
He was a lot more of a fuck-up than I was.

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:55.188
- He was the baby.
- Yeah.

01:19:56.124 --> 01:19:59.093
- He needed us more.
- Yeah, he needed you more.

01:19:59.327 --> 01:20:01.955
You sure it wasn't his cute looks
or his puppiness?

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.495
You were the first.

01:20:06.902 --> 01:20:08.961
The first always has it rougher.

01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:10.662
Yeah, so I'm told.

01:20:13.742 --> 01:20:17.940
You know, the four of you,
I never felt like I was part of the club.

01:20:19.915 --> 01:20:22.076
Beautiful birds of a feather.

01:20:24.886 --> 01:20:26.717
You sure I'm your son?

01:20:42.904 --> 01:20:45.805
Gina and I have got to get back to the city.

01:21:10.632 --> 01:21:11.792
Andy?

01:21:14.269 --> 01:21:15.566
My dad.

01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:18.339
Andy.

01:21:23.478 --> 01:21:24.536
Okay.

01:21:26.381 --> 01:21:28.246
Why don't we pull over?

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:46.928
My dad.

01:21:52.307 --> 01:21:53.467
Oh, God.

01:21:58.413 --> 01:22:01.610
It's not fair! It's not fair!

01:22:02.951 --> 01:22:06.785
All my life I've been afraid
of becoming like him. All my life!

01:22:06.888 --> 01:22:09.686
All my life with you, and it's not fair.

01:22:10.358 --> 01:22:13.191
He can't just say he's sorry
and make it all go away.

01:22:13.295 --> 01:22:14.284
It's too late.

01:22:14.396 --> 01:22:15.761
It's not that easy!

01:22:15.864 --> 01:22:19.231
It's not fair! It's not fucking fair!

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:25.304
No, Dad.

01:22:27.342 --> 01:22:28.900
Oh, God!

01:22:32.547 --> 01:22:34.242
He can't do that!

01:22:40.488 --> 01:22:41.580
Andy.

01:22:54.569 --> 01:22:55.536
Andy.

01:23:22.530 --> 01:23:25.431
- I'll be back in a bit.
- Where are you going?

01:23:26.434 --> 01:23:30.200
I'll be back soon, I just got to...
I got to deal with some stuff.

01:23:30.305 --> 01:23:31.863
What's going on?

01:23:37.312 --> 01:23:39.974
What if you come home and I'm not here?

01:23:42.217 --> 01:23:44.208
You got some place you got to be?

01:24:59.461 --> 01:25:02.988
Your boss called
and he wants you to call him right away.

01:25:06.734 --> 01:25:08.429
Are you in trouble?

01:25:13.007 --> 01:25:14.565
They just miss me.

01:25:17.178 --> 01:25:18.873
Where are you going?

01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:27.354
Something has to change.

01:25:29.157 --> 01:25:32.649
- What do you mean?
- I mean that this just isn't working.

01:25:33.695 --> 01:25:36.528
- What's not working?
- The life that we have.

01:25:37.732 --> 01:25:41.793
It was really bad before Rio
and now it's even worse.

01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:45.168
You never tell me anything
that's going on anymore.

01:25:45.273 --> 01:25:46.934
I don't understand.

01:25:50.044 --> 01:25:51.636
Neither do I.

01:25:51.913 --> 01:25:54.347
What was that in the car yesterday?

01:25:57.719 --> 01:25:59.118
I could help.

01:26:00.555 --> 01:26:02.352
I don't need any help.

01:26:31.085 --> 01:26:34.077
Do you realize
that I've been having an affair?

01:26:38.026 --> 01:26:40.187
What's that supposed to mean?

01:26:40.828 --> 01:26:43.353
Means I've been fucking another guy.

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:49.600
Every Thursday, me and your brother, Hank.
We get together and we fuck.

01:26:51.406 --> 01:26:53.431
Not only that, he loves me.

01:26:55.543 --> 01:26:57.909
And he still finds me attractive.

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:00.445
All the time.

01:27:01.816 --> 01:27:03.579
Not just on vacation.

01:27:07.322 --> 01:27:08.448
Hank?

01:27:12.727 --> 01:27:14.024
Yeah, Hank.

01:27:17.632 --> 01:27:19.827
Aren't you gonna say anything?

01:27:24.439 --> 01:27:26.407
Are you gonna get angry?

01:27:40.288 --> 01:27:44.019
- Where are you gonna go?
- I was just gonna go to my mother's.

01:27:44.826 --> 01:27:46.885
How're you gonna get there?

01:27:49.931 --> 01:27:51.796
I was gonna take a cab.

01:27:57.605 --> 01:28:00.870
I could really use some, some money.

01:28:07.448 --> 01:28:09.439
I'll go to the bank later.

01:28:10.385 --> 01:28:11.443
Here.

01:28:41.382 --> 01:28:44.510
<i>Hi, you've reached Gina and Andy.
Leave a message.</i>

01:29:53.688 --> 01:29:55.883
<i>Please hang up
and try your call...</i>

01:30:12.874 --> 01:30:14.842
Come on.

01:31:09.964 --> 01:31:13.730
Last person I ever thought I'd see again
as long as I lived.

01:31:13.835 --> 01:31:15.302
Charlie Hanson.

01:31:18.239 --> 01:31:20.070
You're still a crook?

01:31:20.408 --> 01:31:22.899
You come all this way to insult me?

01:31:25.446 --> 01:31:29.746
Did you hear anything about a holdup
at the Westchester Shopping Mall?

01:31:29.851 --> 01:31:32.012
What would I know about Westchester?

01:31:32.119 --> 01:31:36.556
That's just for upstanding citizens
such as yourself.

01:31:36.657 --> 01:31:37.783
Have you heard anything?

01:31:37.892 --> 01:31:41.293
Why would I hear anything about anything?
I sell diamonds.

01:31:41.395 --> 01:31:43.124
- And fence them.
- Never!

01:31:43.231 --> 01:31:49.067
Did you hear of a young guy
called Bobby Lasorda?

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:50.831
Wrong tree, Charlie.

01:31:51.405 --> 01:31:55.239
A couple of punks shot my wife in a holdup.
She's dead.

01:31:57.545 --> 01:31:58.807
I'm sorry.

01:31:58.913 --> 01:32:01.177
I don't give a shit
about your little side business,

01:32:01.282 --> 01:32:04.308
I don't care about anything anymore,

01:32:04.418 --> 01:32:07.114
except finding the guy who did this.

01:32:07.221 --> 01:32:09.018
Do you know anything?

01:32:10.791 --> 01:32:14.591
I remember when Charlie Hanson
started out on the streets.

01:32:14.695 --> 01:32:20.031
Young and cocky, good cutter.
A long time ago, Charlie.

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:24.399
You always hated my guts,
you called me a crook,

01:32:24.505 --> 01:32:27.133
but you didn't know shit
about how the world works,

01:32:27.241 --> 01:32:30.574
or what some people will do for money.

01:32:31.045 --> 01:32:32.273
I guess,

01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:36.012
now you know, Charlie.

01:32:42.957 --> 01:32:46.620
The world is an evil place, Charlie.

01:32:47.495 --> 01:32:53.229
Some of us make money off of that,
and others get destroyed.

01:32:55.169 --> 01:32:57.000
He walked in here,

01:32:57.104 --> 01:32:59.800
he looks a little bit like you, Charlie.

01:33:00.107 --> 01:33:04.510
He walked in here and I almost knew him,
right off the bat.

01:33:24.932 --> 01:33:26.092
<i>Hello.</i>

01:33:27.501 --> 01:33:28.490
It's me.

01:33:28.603 --> 01:33:31.731
<i>Andy, Jesus, man, we got problems.</i>

01:33:32.573 --> 01:33:34.268
What do you mean, problems?

01:33:34.375 --> 01:33:38.539
Bobby's girlfriend's
got a fucking brother, okay.

01:33:38.646 --> 01:33:40.011
And the guy is blackmailing me, all right.

01:33:40.948 --> 01:33:45.317
<i>He said he's gonna go to the cops, all right,
or kill me if I don't pay him $10,000.</i>

01:33:45.419 --> 01:33:48.445
All right, all right.

01:33:48.556 --> 01:33:51.024
Just stay there, I'll be right over,
I'll figure something out.

01:33:51.125 --> 01:33:55.027
<i>- Andy, this guy isn't fucking around.
- All right, I'll figure something out.</i>

01:35:26.487 --> 01:35:29.149
Andy, Jake needs to see you.

01:35:29.256 --> 01:35:30.951
They're all in the conference room
with the IRS guys.

01:35:31.058 --> 01:35:32.047
They're going all the way back

01:35:32.159 --> 01:35:34.252
- through your accounts.
- Just fuck 'em, I got to go to my dad's.

01:35:34.595 --> 01:35:36.426
I'm gonna have to tell them you were here.

01:36:29.884 --> 01:36:32.079
For God's sake, say something.

01:36:39.894 --> 01:36:40.918
Okay.

01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:44.591
We're in trouble.

01:36:46.667 --> 01:36:50.364
The worst trouble imaginable.
You're aware of that, right?

01:36:51.772 --> 01:36:54.570
So, why don't we try and fix it?

01:36:56.210 --> 01:37:00.078
There's almost no choice,
but you're gonna have to follow my lead.

01:37:00.181 --> 01:37:02.342
No questions, no hesitations.

01:37:02.716 --> 01:37:06.015
I've done that before, all right,
and that's how come I'm standing here,

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:07.951
with my life going down the fucking toilet.

01:37:08.055 --> 01:37:09.522
Fuck you, fuck you, I'll do it alone.

01:37:09.623 --> 01:37:11.887
You can sit here and wait till you go to jail

01:37:11.992 --> 01:37:13.857
and take it up the ass
for the rest of your fucking life.

01:37:13.961 --> 01:37:16.691
Let's do it already, what's your idea?

01:37:18.899 --> 01:37:20.890
Sorry, what's your idea?

01:37:27.241 --> 01:37:29.675
What's Bobby's girlfriend's name?

01:37:30.644 --> 01:37:32.612
Chris. Yeah, Chris.

01:37:32.713 --> 01:37:34.340
Chris.

01:37:34.448 --> 01:37:38.179
Call Chris, tell her to get her brother
over to her apartment.

01:37:38.319 --> 01:37:41.015
- What for?
- We'll meet him.

01:37:41.255 --> 01:37:44.986
He figures we owe him $10,000,
we have to resolve it.

01:37:45.092 --> 01:37:46.889
Resolve it how?

01:37:49.730 --> 01:37:52.426
Play it by ear, see what happens,
maybe we pay him.

01:37:52.533 --> 01:37:55.001
He's never gonna let us off the hook.

01:37:55.102 --> 01:37:59.198
All right, we're gonna be paying him back
for the rest of our lives.

01:38:01.308 --> 01:38:04.607
Hey, you finally figured out
something for yourself.

01:38:07.681 --> 01:38:10.548
Let's just get the money, see what happens.

01:38:12.019 --> 01:38:14.283
Where are we gonna get $10,000?

01:38:16.090 --> 01:38:18.388
No, that might be easier.

01:38:23.497 --> 01:38:24.828
Call Chris.

01:38:26.367 --> 01:38:27.493
Taxi!

01:39:27.094 --> 01:39:29.858
Andy, Jesus Christ! You're gonna kill him.

01:39:31.765 --> 01:39:32.959
Come on.

01:39:35.202 --> 01:39:36.169
Shit.

01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:57.789
Come on.

01:40:00.594 --> 01:40:03.062
Hold the bag. Hold out the fucking bag!

01:40:04.565 --> 01:40:07.227
Hold it open like this. Hold it open like that!

01:40:07.334 --> 01:40:09.063
I got it, I got it.

01:40:14.608 --> 01:40:17.076
- Oh, shit, do you want these?
- Just put it in the bag!

01:40:17.177 --> 01:40:18.974
Put it in the bag!

01:40:21.849 --> 01:40:23.316
- Out.
- Got it.

01:40:37.898 --> 01:40:39.695
Oh, my God, Andy.

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:41.290
- Did you touch anything?
- Did you go crazy?

01:40:41.402 --> 01:40:42.733
- Did you touch anything?
- Are you fucking nuts?

01:40:42.836 --> 01:40:45.771
- Did you touch anything?
- Wait, you didn't have to kill him, all right.

01:40:45.873 --> 01:40:48.706
He's not gonna go to the cops. All right?
He's a drug dealer.

01:40:48.842 --> 01:40:52.073
Yeah, I guess he'll just go
to some other dealers and suppliers

01:40:52.179 --> 01:40:54.773
and that's all we need,
is 10 South Americans chasing us

01:40:54.882 --> 01:40:57.908
for the rest of our lives.
Did you touch anything?

01:40:58.018 --> 01:40:59.645
I don't think so.

01:40:59.753 --> 01:41:02.119
- You don't think so?
- I don't think so, no!

01:41:02.222 --> 01:41:05.089
- No, I didn't touch anything!
- Think, God damn it, you think!

01:41:05.192 --> 01:41:07.092
- I don't... I don't like this, Andy!
- Did you touch anything?

01:41:07.194 --> 01:41:09.560
- I don't like...
- Shut up! Shut up!

01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:15.193
- Did you touch anything?
- No.

01:41:16.303 --> 01:41:17.668
Are we good?

01:41:18.872 --> 01:41:20.066
Let's go.

01:42:21.301 --> 01:42:23.166
<i>You got the money, chico?</i>

01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:25.204
I don't like wasted trips.

01:42:28.542 --> 01:42:30.533
You don't look happy.

01:42:30.644 --> 01:42:32.578
Mind if I call you groucho?

01:42:33.914 --> 01:42:35.506
No, I don't mind.

01:42:41.355 --> 01:42:44.017
Like what you're seeing?
- Yeah, a lot.

01:42:44.992 --> 01:42:47.460
- Stand up. Stand up!
- All right, all right.

01:42:47.561 --> 01:42:50.587
- Turn around.
- All right, all right, all right.

01:42:53.634 --> 01:42:55.568
So how we gonna do this?

01:42:56.837 --> 01:42:59.738
Gladly pay you the money, got plenty of it.

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:02.172
How do we know you're not gonna bleed us
for the next couple of months?

01:43:02.276 --> 01:43:04.676
I just want enough to take care of Chris.

01:43:04.778 --> 01:43:08.612
That's nice, my brother
wouldn't take care of me like that.

01:43:08.715 --> 01:43:11.946
Hey, what do you say, Chris,
should I trust this guy?

01:43:14.054 --> 01:43:15.578
- Yes.
- Speak up. What?

01:43:15.689 --> 01:43:17.122
Yes.

01:43:17.224 --> 01:43:18.816
I don't think so.

01:43:20.661 --> 01:43:23.425
No, Andy, don't, don't, don't...

01:43:24.765 --> 01:43:27.632
- What did you say?
- No, you can't do that, I won't let you.

01:43:27.734 --> 01:43:29.065
- You won't let me?
- No, no more,

01:43:29.169 --> 01:43:31.569
you kill her, you're gonna have to kill me.

01:43:31.672 --> 01:43:33.401
Not such a bad idea.

01:43:37.177 --> 01:43:39.372
You know, in fact, it's a pretty good one.

01:43:48.088 --> 01:43:49.988
You know I know.

01:43:52.192 --> 01:43:53.750
What do you know?

01:43:55.896 --> 01:43:57.056
I know.

01:44:03.103 --> 01:44:04.400
I'm sorry.

01:44:04.972 --> 01:44:06.667
I fucked it all up.

01:44:09.376 --> 01:44:10.707
Just do it.

01:44:11.545 --> 01:44:12.705
Do it.

01:44:14.748 --> 01:44:15.976
Go ahead.

01:44:17.484 --> 01:44:18.644
Come on.

01:44:20.254 --> 01:44:22.279
You'd be doing me a favor.

01:44:25.626 --> 01:44:26.820
Come on.

01:44:41.842 --> 01:44:43.810
Get the hell out of here.

01:44:57.491 --> 01:45:00.085
Get the hell out of here! Go!

01:45:00.193 --> 01:45:01.285
Go!

01:45:14.574 --> 01:45:17.270
Hank! Hank!

01:45:37.197 --> 01:45:39.995
<i>Move out of the way,
move out of the way.</i>

01:45:41.034 --> 01:45:44.401
<i>You'll have to move your vehicle.
Move out of the way.</i>

01:46:48.869 --> 01:46:50.131
Hi, Mr. Hanson.

01:46:50.237 --> 01:46:51.329
Stick your head in. If he's awake now,

01:46:51.438 --> 01:46:53.963
you can spend
a couple of minutes with him.

01:47:36.416 --> 01:47:37.383
Dad?

01:47:42.355 --> 01:47:44.346
I never meant to hurt her.

01:47:45.192 --> 01:47:46.921
I just needed money.

01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:52.564
There wasn't supposed to be any gun.

01:47:53.467 --> 01:47:57.563
She wasn't supposed to be in the store.
Everything just went wrong.

01:48:05.579 --> 01:48:07.570
It's okay, Andy.

01:48:15.355 --> 01:48:16.652
It's okay.

01:49:09.843 --> 01:49:13.404
Nurse, the heart monitor
cut out for a second.

01:49:13.513 --> 01:49:17.074
It does that, don't worry.
If it happens again, just press reset.

01:50:45.572 --> 01:50:46.539
Dad.

01:51:42.829 --> 01:51:43.921
Nurse!

01:51:49.736 --> 01:51:52.170
<i>Emergency personnel, code blue.</i>

01:51:52.272 --> 01:51:54.672
<i>Emergency personnel, code blue.</i>
