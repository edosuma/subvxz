00:02.336 --> 00:06.756
Tonight, a £65,000 car
for the people.

00:06.756 --> 00:10.556
A Range Rover at 45 degrees.

00:10.556 --> 00:14.765
And the new Bentley Coupe
comes to our studio.

00:16.416 --> 00:20.656
Hello, welcome to the last show
in the series.

00:20.656 --> 00:22.966
AUDIENCE: Aaah!

00:22.966 --> 00:28.279
We're going out with a grrr,
we've got the new TVR.

00:35.316 --> 00:42.856
We first came across this car
last year. Back then it was
a work-in-progress kind of thing.

00:42.856 --> 00:45.586
The Stig found it a handful.

00:46.776 --> 00:51.866
So here we are in 2003.
Summertime, obviously.

00:51.866 --> 00:54.616
and the 350C is finally ready.

00:54.616 --> 00:54.696
What we get is a £38,500 car,
3. 6-litre straight six engine

00:54.696 --> 00:59.804
with 350bhp.

01:02.416 --> 01:08.764
So it's not the full-on TVR
hurricane, more a strong storm.

01:12.006 --> 01:18.166
But don't think you can relax. Even
a small TVR can take your head off.

01:18.166 --> 01:22.396
It's a scary full-on kind of thing.

01:22.396 --> 01:27.948
It's what they're best at - great
if you like your cars full fat.

01:30.876 --> 01:38.260
But these days the TVR has to work
hard to keep up with the modern
competition. A bit like these.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074

01:58.096 --> 02:02.786
Like the TVR, the Harrier
is a great British institution.

02:02.786 --> 02:08.366
It's 42 years old and been updated
to keep up with modern demands.

02:08.366 --> 02:12.396
The new Harrier GR9 is cleverer,
faster, more comfortable

02:12.396 --> 02:15.366
and easier to fly.

02:15.366 --> 02:22.829
This jet has raised its game
but in a world of Porsche Boxters,
can the TVR do the same?

02:26.596 --> 02:33.226
Well, it's still a TVR. It's
raucous, raw, insane to look at,

02:33.226 --> 02:38.226
and it smells like a fibreglass
canoe factory in here.

02:38.226 --> 02:42.754
It's also loud.
Properly, properly loud.

02:47.166 --> 02:53.246
And along with the usual TVR noise,
you get the usual TVR interior -

02:53.246 --> 02:59.246
crazy hand-stitched leather, with
beautifully crafted switch gear.

02:59.246 --> 03:03.068
So far then,
it's same old, same old.

03:05.926 --> 03:09.646
However, there is a fundamental
difference here.

03:09.646 --> 03:12.966
The ride, it's just right.

03:12.966 --> 03:16.336
On A and B roads, fine.

03:16.336 --> 03:18.906
It feels more grown up.

03:18.906 --> 03:25.006
More like a proper car from a
sensible grown-up manufacturer.

03:25.006 --> 03:29.086
So finally, there's a TVR
that you really can use.

03:29.086 --> 03:31.668
It's almost an everyday car.

03:33.086 --> 03:36.046
I really like it, it works.

03:36.046 --> 03:42.849
It must have limits though. It's
not wise to find them on the road.
So let's be off to the track.

03:56.566 --> 03:59.416
Oh, this feels good.

03:59.416 --> 04:03.646
This feels good. It feels tight
and taut and together.

04:03.646 --> 04:06.797
It's these brakes though.

04:09.846 --> 04:12.736
I mean, I love accelerating...

04:12.736 --> 04:19.426
But for the first time in my life,
I'm looking forward to breaking
almost as much.

04:26.335 --> 04:30.885
Normally driving a TVR with
any kind of sense of purpose

04:30.885 --> 04:35.095
is like chatting to a bloke
in the pub.

04:35.095 --> 04:39.775
He says, "We went on holiday,
took the caravan. " Then boof!

04:39.775 --> 04:42.903
And then he punches you in the face.
No warning.

04:44.805 --> 04:48.815
This though, this has under steer.
It's telling me,

04:48.815 --> 04:52.888
"You're getting on my nerves a bit. "

04:54.055 --> 04:59.721
It hasn't lost the lairiness but
it's just been to anger management.

05:01.555 --> 05:07.045
And that makes it the most
user-friendly TVR I've ever been in.

05:07.045 --> 05:12.725
But it does still have TVR blood
in its veins.

05:12.725 --> 05:15.842
It's a big one.

05:17.535 --> 05:22.518
So if you push it and push it,
you can still make a hash of it.

05:30.535 --> 05:33.242
Ooh, BLEEP. Oh, that's a bad one.

05:35.735 --> 05:38.295
Did that on purpose.

05:38.295 --> 05:42.245
But you've really got to want
to provoke it.

05:42.245 --> 05:49.415
I mean, like walking through
the lion enclosure covered in
sausages and spilling their pints.

05:49.415 --> 05:52.175
I'm driving the TVR on a wet track

05:52.175 --> 05:56.615
and I don't feel like
I've got the Grim Reaper

05:56.615 --> 06:00.381
sitting next to me,
clearing his throat.

06:06.135 --> 06:11.695
So like the Harrier, the TVR 350C
keeps its character.

06:11.695 --> 06:15.279
But in a world of young guns,
it can still cut it.

06:18.095 --> 06:22.855
Wonderful. Great
car, best TVR I've ever driven.

06:22.855 --> 06:25.665
You could live with it. You could.

06:25.665 --> 06:28.295
However... Oh dear.

06:28.295 --> 06:31.545
If I were going to buy a British
sports car,

06:31.545 --> 06:34.495
I'd be tempted by this, the Noble.

06:34.495 --> 06:37.655
It came here last year
and did 1.33 in the wet.

06:37.655 --> 06:40.495
I think the TVR would thrash that.

06:40.495 --> 06:45.505
That was with the 2.5-litre engine.
It now has a three-litre engine.

06:45.505 --> 06:49.935
It has a three-litre Mondeo engine,
Ford Mondeo engine.

06:49.935 --> 06:57.595
Turbo-charged...
This has a proper straight six
configuration. It's a race car.

06:57.595 --> 07:01.975
That's a childish thing.
Top Trumps. Top Trumps, OK?

07:01.975 --> 07:04.615
Give me your 0-60 time.

07:04.615 --> 07:11.255
4.4 seconds. 4.1, thrashes you,
thrashes you. It's pathetic.

07:11.255 --> 07:16.135
Top speed. 175 miles an hour. Go
on, big fella, what have you got?

07:16.135 --> 07:18.979
175mph...

07:20.985 --> 07:24.175
167. Yes! Thank you.

07:24.175 --> 07:28.705
Tell you what, price.
Mine is £38,500.

07:28.705 --> 07:30.815
JEREMY MUMBLES

07:30.815 --> 07:34.745
That sounded like forty-something
to me.

07:34.745 --> 07:36.605
47.

07:36.605 --> 07:41.345
That's nearly nine...
That's made in Blackpool.

07:41.345 --> 07:47.825
Yours is nailed together in South
Africa and shipped into Leicester.

07:47.825 --> 07:53.695
We'll settle this. The track,
wheel out the Stig. This is a duel.

07:53.695 --> 07:57.265
A magnificent start! He's gone!

07:57.265 --> 07:59.825
Look at that. He's up to 30.

08:03.745 --> 08:07.575
It's a proud thing,
look at the control there.

08:07.575 --> 08:12.585
That's a record for the slowest on
that corner. It's under control!

08:12.585 --> 08:16.785
He nearly lost it
on the braking there.

08:16.785 --> 08:19.345
What a proper car!

08:19.345 --> 08:24.105
Look at that! Do you know,
is this lap ever going to end?

08:24.105 --> 08:28.025
Listen to that straight six!

08:28.025 --> 08:31.345
45mph. Don't be ridiculous,
look at the control.

08:31.345 --> 08:36.424
Little bit adrift. Oh, that was
moving, Jeremy. Has it finished?

08:36.424 --> 08:42.375
Let's see your ridiculous Mondeo
engine. Here's a real performance.

08:44.585 --> 08:47.185
It's gone already!

08:47.185 --> 08:50.105
That is fabulous, look.

08:50.105 --> 08:55.245
On the brakes. No understeer
in this, no understeer at all.

08:55.245 --> 08:59.145
It's dangerous!
Look at that, oversteer.

08:59.145 --> 09:05.025
No, we didn't lose it in braking
there. He's going to crash it!

09:05.025 --> 09:08.605
It's plainly ridiculous.
He will crash.

09:08.605 --> 09:12.985
No, he isn't.
Beautiful driving from the Stig.

09:12.985 --> 09:17.345
Noble Noble! And across the line,
there we are.

09:17.345 --> 09:22.745
I'll show you mine if you show me
yours. OK, one minute... One minute.

09:22.745 --> 09:27.185
20? 20. I'm surprised you did it
in a one twenty-something.

09:27.185 --> 09:31.665
One minute, 27! I thank you.
Which puts it up there.

09:31.665 --> 09:36.625
That is very fast. Let me give you
a hand. That's fantastic.

09:36.625 --> 09:39.235
Sadly though, one minute 25.

09:39.235 --> 09:42.025
No! No! Yes.

09:42.025 --> 09:44.705
APPLAUSE

09:44.705 --> 09:46.695
Yeah, but...

09:46.695 --> 09:51.045
Look at it! Loser!

09:51.045 --> 09:54.181
Loser! Loser!

09:54.181 --> 09:57.531
Loser, loser, loser, loser, loser!

09:57.531 --> 10:02.411
Look, it's a childish car.
Look what it brought out in you.

10:02.411 --> 10:07.781
Now you're just being childish, I'm
not going to get cross. You lost.

10:07.781 --> 10:11.535
I don't care! De-de-de-de-de-de!
I don't care!

10:17.491 --> 10:23.991
If you've got a lot of money to
spend on a big four-door saloon,

10:23.991 --> 10:26.611
there's already lots of choice.

10:26.611 --> 10:31.891
You've got the Audi A8,
the Mercedes S-Class,

10:31.891 --> 10:34.791
and the Jaguar XJ.

10:34.791 --> 10:40.071
Now, there's a new alternative.
Here it is in all its brownness.

10:40.071 --> 10:42.891
It's called the Phaeton,

10:42.891 --> 10:46.801
and it costs £65,000.

10:46.801 --> 10:53.661
Which is odd, cos it's
a Volkswagen, and Volkswagen
means "people's car". Right.

10:53.661 --> 10:56.676
TRADITIONAL AUSTRIAN WALTZ PLAYS

10:57.291 --> 11:01.621
When they found evidence
of life on Mars, it was big.

11:01.621 --> 11:07.301
This is bigger. This proves
there's humour in the fatherland.

11:07.301 --> 11:12.451
This is the first ever recorded
example of a German joke.

11:12.451 --> 11:17.371
A Volkswagen that costs £65,000!

11:17.371 --> 11:20.171
CANNED LAUGHTER

11:20.171 --> 11:24.291
But actually, it isn't funny.

11:24.291 --> 11:29.281
MUSIC: "Air on the G String"
by Bach

11:29.281 --> 11:34.551
The Phaeton was the swan song
for VW's boss, Ferdinand Piech.

11:34.551 --> 11:37.201
He wanted to retire with a bang.

11:37.201 --> 11:40.716
He wanted to make
the best car... ever.

11:42.801 --> 11:47.631
He laid down ten parameters,
which were so impossible,

11:47.631 --> 11:53.471
that half his engineers walked out.
They said it couldn't be done.

11:53.471 --> 12:01.391
I've tried to get VW to tell me
what these parameters are,
but they've only given me one.

12:01.391 --> 12:07.791
Piech insisted you should be
able to drive the Phaeton all day,

12:07.791 --> 12:14.041
at 186 miles an hour,
when it's 122 degrees outside,

12:14.041 --> 12:21.675
and the air conditioning must be
able to maintain an inside
temperature of 71. 6 degrees.

12:23.651 --> 12:27.041
My, I bet
he was fun to go out with!

12:30.151 --> 12:38.122
I know this looks like a boring car
from a boring man, on a boring
wet day, but stay with me.

12:38.122 --> 12:43.671
The attention to detail
in the Phaeton is staggering.

12:43.671 --> 12:47.801
Let's stick with
the air conditioning and heating.

12:47.802 --> 12:52.571
Most cars blow air through vents.
Look what happens.

12:52.571 --> 12:57.671
Push this button, and a panel
slides down and acts as a radiator.

12:57.671 --> 13:02.002
First car I've even been in
that's got central heating.

13:02.002 --> 13:07.002
There's a dehumidifier too,
so the windows can't steam up.

13:07.002 --> 13:10.403
No matter what you get up to.

13:11.442 --> 13:16.882
I can test that, by stepping into
the back with Danielle.

13:16.882 --> 13:21.091
Don't worry, it's all
in the name of science.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.922
There we are.

13:27.922 --> 13:30.527
SULTRY MUSIC

13:35.122 --> 13:38.202
That is extraordinary.

13:38.202 --> 13:43.662
We've made ourselves a lovely cup
of tea. The kettle's bubbling away.

13:43.662 --> 13:46.722
But, we can still see
out of the windows.

13:46.722 --> 13:49.382
Lovely view.

13:49.382 --> 13:53.125
Hey, in't it nice?

13:54.171 --> 13:57.602
There's more too.

13:57.602 --> 14:02.391
Look at these hinges.
No-one's ever going to see them,

14:02.391 --> 14:05.882
and yet they're
so beautifully machined.

14:05.882 --> 14:10.122
Round at the front,
things get even more... German.

14:10.122 --> 14:13.561
Normally,
when you use the headlamp washers,

14:13.561 --> 14:20.341
huge jets of water squirt
onto the glass and you can't
see where you're going.

14:20.341 --> 14:24.131
Look what happens.
This one fires first of all.

14:24.131 --> 14:30.171
And when it's done, this one fires.
So there's always illumination.

14:30.171 --> 14:36.171
Then there's the bonnet. Piech
insisted it had to stay level,

14:36.171 --> 14:40.441
with no vibration,
right up to 190 miles an hour.

14:40.441 --> 14:46.721
Which sounds like overkill really,
cos the Phaeton is limited to 155.

14:49.241 --> 14:53.451
I have driven one of these things
without a limiter.

14:53.451 --> 14:58.718
It went up to a smooth and
totally stable 201 miles an hour.

15:00.491 --> 15:04.541
Even at that speed,
I couldn't hear the engine.

15:05.571 --> 15:09.681
Its two three-litre V6s
glued together,

15:09.681 --> 15:13.131
so the cylinders
are in that sort of shape.

15:13.131 --> 15:16.089
It's a six-litre W12.

15:17.081 --> 15:21.711
It's an amazing engine.
It's an amazing car.

15:25.811 --> 15:31.041
It pains me to admit it, but if I
were gonna buy a four-door saloon,

15:31.041 --> 15:35.491
I would have that Phaeton.
Even with the VW badge?

15:35.491 --> 15:39.291
It's an amazing car, amazing.

15:39.291 --> 15:44.071
Interestingly, they're gonna
do a two-door version - kind of.

15:44.071 --> 15:48.351
It's all the technical stuff
in a different body.

15:48.351 --> 15:51.881
But with a much better badge.
It's this!

15:51.881 --> 15:58.071
The Bentley Continental GT. The
most anticipated car for decades.

15:58.071 --> 16:03.171
Designed by a Belgian, who's only
previous car was the Skoda Fabia.

16:03.171 --> 16:10.251
It's a career jump. Like an
architect designing a garage then
doing the Natural History Museum.

16:10.251 --> 16:16.051
But his mum can be proud. She can
be chuffed. Look at this interior!

16:16.051 --> 16:21.611
It's like the Aston Martin Vantage
with Phaeton stuff everywhere.

16:21.611 --> 16:27.061
But, there's a sense of absolute
luxury and absolute power.

16:27.061 --> 16:30.991
Bentley said we can't drive it
as it's not ready.

16:30.991 --> 16:36.531
It'll be ready by the end of the
year, for its launch at £120,000.

16:36.531 --> 16:41.541
Tell them how fast it goes.
This is a big car, remember.

16:41.541 --> 16:46.051
A big Bentley the size
of this building. 0-60? 4. 8!

16:46.051 --> 16:50.771
4.8 seconds! Top speed. Top speed.
Any ideas? I'll tell you.

16:50.771 --> 16:53.531
Want to guess? 200!

16:53.531 --> 16:57.131
LAUGHTER

16:57.131 --> 17:00.180
APPLAUSE

17:03.301 --> 17:06.771
Well, you get clever,
that's what you get.

17:06.771 --> 17:10.501
He's wrong.
It's 198 miles an hour.

17:10.501 --> 17:15.611
I won't do that again.
198 is phenomenally fast.

17:15.611 --> 17:20.211
Truth be told, we're not Bentley
owners, I'm certainly not.

17:20.211 --> 17:26.011
We could use the opinion of one.
You have a Bentley. Sort of.

17:26.011 --> 17:31.701
It's old, but it's a Bentley.
What do you think of this?

17:31.701 --> 17:37.021
The engine's good, and it's got two
turbo chargers. The Phaeton doesn't.

17:37.021 --> 17:42.571
It's got 550 brake horsepower.
50 more than a Ferrari 575.

17:42.571 --> 17:47.411
They put it on a machine
and it ripped the machine apart.

17:47.411 --> 17:51.501
It just roared off. So,
the engine's good. Just a bit!

17:51.501 --> 17:56.211
We like the shape? Yup.
Interior? Yup. Ashtray action.

17:56.211 --> 18:03.011
I haven't looked in the boot.
It's not stacking up to be
a disaster. It's looking good.

18:03.011 --> 18:08.301
I'm gonna be testing it in the next
series. I'm gonna be testing it.

18:08.301 --> 18:13.170
The opinion of a younger guy...
Heavy cars need heavy drivers.

18:15.401 --> 18:18.552
Ladies and gentleman, Alan Davies!

18:22.829 --> 18:25.912
How are you? Have a seat.

18:31.549 --> 18:35.329
What's erm...what's happened
to your locks?

18:35.329 --> 18:38.989
They're not as long?
I thought they were longer.

18:38.989 --> 18:45.169
They used to be long, but now you
can glue hair in if you need it.

18:45.169 --> 18:49.789
Is it glued on in Jonathan Creek?
Yep. It's hair extensions?

18:49.789 --> 18:54.229
For the last two series,
it's glued-in hair from Europe.

18:54.229 --> 18:59.169
You are a bit of a petrolhead
beneath the hair extensions?

18:59.169 --> 19:04.839
I like a car. What have you got?
I've got an Alfa 147.

19:04.839 --> 19:10.169
There, you see. Look at this.
She... Do that face again,

19:10.169 --> 19:15.989
that you just did? That knowing...
I think there's a reason for that.

19:15.989 --> 19:20.989
I've got a theory on Alfas. It's
not possible to be a petrolhead,

19:20.989 --> 19:25.099
unless you've owned an Alfa Romeo.
You think? Yeah.

19:25.099 --> 19:29.809
I'll take that as a compliment.
You had Cavaliers for a while.

19:29.809 --> 19:32.899
I had a Mini and then...

19:32.899 --> 19:38.529
I got a white Vauxhall Cavalier
in about 1984-85.

19:38.529 --> 19:41.119
Me dad got it for me.

19:41.119 --> 19:46.359
Harry Enfield had a Cavalier at one
time. Yes. Convertible. Did he?

19:46.359 --> 19:49.319
He was the only person with one.

19:49.319 --> 19:53.899
Is there a Cavalier thing running
through the stand-up?

19:53.899 --> 19:58.349
Mark Lamarr had one too.
We'd stand outside clubs going,

19:58.349 --> 20:04.429
"Good, aren't they?" Then Enfield
walks out with his convertible.

20:04.429 --> 20:09.499
Did you go round together?
When you do gigs out of town,

20:09.499 --> 20:14.439
you take three or four people,
and say, "Who's driving? "

20:14.439 --> 20:20.439
I was in the Cavalier driving one
night from Birmingham, down the M6.

20:20.439 --> 20:24.039
In the middle of the road
were two vast limos.

20:24.039 --> 20:29.719
I'm in the outside lane, with Harry
Hill next to me and two other guys.

20:29.719 --> 20:35.119
The first limo, it's a bloke in a
cap, the other one is Barry Manilow.

20:35.119 --> 20:40.829
Unmistakably Barry Manilow.
Remember, we're in profile.

20:40.829 --> 20:44.119
And Harry Hill immediately starts,

20:44.119 --> 20:48.999
# You write the songs
that make the whole world sing! #

20:48.999 --> 20:53.699
He looks across and there's
four blokes in a Cavalier going,

20:53.699 --> 20:57.659
# You write the songs
you write the songs! #

20:57.659 --> 21:02.519
He sped off at 90. Once, coming from
Birmingham, Lee Evans was driving,

21:02.519 --> 21:05.639
it was something similar
to a Cavalier.

21:05.639 --> 21:10.719
Four of us said, "Lee, we need
chips, we're really hungry. "

21:10.719 --> 21:12.799
He said, "All right!"

21:12.799 --> 21:18.259
We head off into Birmingham town
centre and we get pulled over.

21:18.259 --> 21:23.109
And the police get him out
and make him sit in their car.

21:23.109 --> 21:26.499
We're sat there thinking,
"This is bad. "

21:26.499 --> 21:32.768
The copper stuck his head in
and said, "So you's lot are
all comedians, are you?"

21:34.719 --> 21:38.239
We didn't speak,
we were just like...

21:38.239 --> 21:41.719
Coogan was a complete petrol nut.

21:41.719 --> 21:45.399
Coogan loves cars.
I only went in his car once.

21:45.399 --> 21:50.769
He had a left-hand drive MX5
with some nitroglycerin attachment.

21:52.129 --> 21:54.799
Turbo charger, probably.

21:54.799 --> 21:57.889
We were at Beverly Racecourse

21:57.889 --> 22:05.129
and having failed to get off
with anyone, he gave me a lift.
I was the closest thing to a girl.

22:05.129 --> 22:08.679
The others were in the minibus
that we went up in.

22:08.679 --> 22:15.979
We've shot off in this brrggghh!
He did what we would've done,
flipped the roof off at 80 mph.

22:15.979 --> 22:20.329
Clip. Clip. Ferboom! Like that.
One hand on the wheel.

22:20.329 --> 22:25.869
We're coming to a roundabout,
and the speedo's on 100.

22:25.869 --> 22:30.529
Then I realise it's kilometres.
It's still 62.

22:30.529 --> 22:35.629
We're near a country hotel with
a gate, a dark bit, then the hotel.

22:35.629 --> 22:40.489
You'd think the road goes straight,
Steve went into it.

22:40.489 --> 22:43.519
Straight off the road, into a field,

22:43.519 --> 22:47.489
Bouncing...
There's a fence, like that.

22:47.489 --> 22:51.346
The minibus is going,
achump, chiggum, chiggum.

22:52.359 --> 22:54.729
It's hare and tortoise stuff,

22:54.729 --> 22:59.559
he has to spin it back, it's hissing
and spitting, get into the car park,

22:59.559 --> 23:02.869
and leap out of a car caked in mud.

23:02.869 --> 23:05.399
Do you buy cars for material?

23:05.399 --> 23:08.469
No. I've never talked about cars.

23:08.469 --> 23:13.259
Stuff that happened when I was
younger was made for comedy.

23:13.259 --> 23:17.489
When I was 21, I was stopped
on the M25.

23:17.489 --> 23:20.759
They took me to court for speeding.

23:20.759 --> 23:25.409
They said, "He was doing
between 106 and 108mph. "

23:25.409 --> 23:31.075
I said, "That's 107, then. "
LAUGHTER

23:32.469 --> 23:37.729
It was fair. They banned me on
the spot. It was in Brentwood court.

23:37.729 --> 23:41.129
I said, "How do I get home? I drove. "

23:41.129 --> 23:48.069
They said, "Your problem. "
"Really, how do I get home?
Forget I'm a criminal.

23:48.069 --> 23:51.529
"Imagine I'm a passer-by.

23:51.529 --> 23:56.169
"How do I get back to Loughton
from here?" "Your problem. "

23:56.169 --> 24:00.989
So I got annoyed. I got in the car
and drove. "Nee-na, nee-na!"

24:00.989 --> 24:09.009
They were laughing. They arrested me,
took me back to the court,
in front of the same magistrate.

24:09.009 --> 24:14.169
I was in the public gallery. A guy
said, "There's four a day like that. "

24:14.169 --> 24:19.529
"Next time, park in the hospital
over the road - they won't see you. "

24:19.529 --> 24:22.229
LAUGHTER

24:22.229 --> 24:25.829
We'll see you now in a Suzuki Liana.

24:25.829 --> 24:30.899
OK. Was it raining out there?
It started to rain more and more.

24:30.899 --> 24:36.769
It was wet? It was all right at
first, but then it rained a lot.

24:36.769 --> 24:40.929
"Brake, brake, brake!"
the Stig kept saying.

24:40.929 --> 24:45.859
I was thinking, "Brake, brake,
windscreen wipers!"

24:45.859 --> 24:53.059
Who would you like to beat on the
board? Where do you want to be?
Michael Gambon did a wet lap.

24:53.059 --> 24:57.529
Ross Kemp, 1.54 - wet.
Coogan, 1.53 in the wet.

24:57.529 --> 25:02.129
That's respectable. Near Coogan.
Do you want to beat him?

25:02.129 --> 25:08.511
I've been in his MX5. It's doubtful.
Shall we find out?
Let's have a look.

25:10.849 --> 25:14.139
'What did you think of the car? OK. '

25:14.139 --> 25:16.629
I've burnt so far.

25:16.629 --> 25:19.439
TYRES SQUEAL

25:19.439 --> 25:24.429
Really, really, really BLEEP it.

25:24.429 --> 25:27.979
That's where Jodie Kidd was quick.

25:27.979 --> 25:32.129
She was on that line
all the way round.

25:32.129 --> 25:36.839
It's hard to stay on the line.
I know! My word.

25:36.839 --> 25:41.499
Coming up to Michael Gambon corner,
where he nearly rolled it.

25:41.499 --> 25:45.289
Are you OK? Yes! Across the line.

25:45.289 --> 25:47.905
APPLAUSE

25:52.629 --> 25:55.299
How did I do?

25:55.299 --> 25:57.659
One minute...

25:57.659 --> 26:02.779
Shall we call that wet or dry?
We need a new category - D for damp.

26:02.779 --> 26:06.039
Yeah. Mildly damp. It was damp.

26:06.039 --> 26:08.379
You did it...

26:08.379 --> 26:11.039
One minute...

26:11.039 --> 26:14.049
54 seconds!

26:14.049 --> 26:16.899
Oh, not too bad!

26:16.899 --> 26:20.938
So you're just behind...

26:25.379 --> 26:31.939
You're a second off Coogan, but he
did it in a monsoon and was 1.53.

26:31.939 --> 26:39.039
I believe that. You didn't have
a completely smooth practice,
did you? No.

26:39.039 --> 26:44.399
You broke our Liana. I did.
You broke our Liana. Look at this.

26:44.399 --> 26:47.209
TYRES SCREECH

26:49.689 --> 26:52.219
'Look at that!'

26:52.219 --> 26:57.599
'Look at that front wheel!
That wasn't from the spin. '

26:57.599 --> 27:02.499
It wouldn't go round the corner.
'You broke it!'

27:02.499 --> 27:08.539
You can see the ambulance
in the background!
I came round the corner...

27:08.539 --> 27:12.999
I thought that was my best lap.
Not with a puncture.

27:12.999 --> 27:16.339
It slows you down a bit.

27:16.339 --> 27:20.739
But a good time. Great to see you.
Alan Davies!

27:20.739 --> 27:24.004
APPLAUSE

27:26.299 --> 27:31.609
News came into the office the other
day that Cadillac was in trouble.

27:31.609 --> 27:36.539
So immediately,
Hammond and I went to lunch.

27:36.539 --> 27:41.499
But May said, "I'll see what's wrong
and how they're putting it right. "

27:41.499 --> 27:47.335
Over to you, Billy Bob
Jimmy May Junior III.

27:49.259 --> 27:52.219
Here's the problem.

27:52.219 --> 27:57.259
Cadillac's main customers are a lot
of doddery old biffers in Florida.

27:57.259 --> 28:02.699
People who like their suspensions
soft, like their sprouts.

28:02.699 --> 28:05.619
The situation's worse in Britain.

28:05.619 --> 28:10.459
They tried the STS, but no-one
bought one. Except Stuart Hall.

28:10.459 --> 28:13.429
Some drastic measures are necessary.

28:13.429 --> 28:18.423
MUSIC: "Shine On You Crazy Diamond
Part One" by Pink Floyd

28:21.669 --> 28:25.139
So how drastic is this?

28:25.139 --> 28:27.529
It's the Cadillac 16 -

28:27.529 --> 28:33.240
a car designed to show us that
Cadillac can lead the way in luxury.

28:36.229 --> 28:42.949
It's very big, which is good,
and it's rather clever -
let's look at the engine.

28:42.949 --> 28:49.869
That is a 13.5-litre V16 -
16 cylinders.

28:49.869 --> 28:53.139
Cruising uses four cylinders.

28:53.139 --> 28:56.149
If you overtake, you use eight.

28:56.149 --> 29:00.399
Only when you flatten it,
do you get 16.

29:00.399 --> 29:06.009
That means that this 2.5 tonne,
20-foot long car will do 20 mpg.

29:06.009 --> 29:08.819
That's very impressive.

29:08.819 --> 29:13.995
My old Bentley does 14 mpg,
and that's a small car.

29:15.259 --> 29:20.109
Inside is like a rich,
self-made American's house.

29:20.109 --> 29:25.029
The wood is too shiny, the leather
like a supermodel's buttocks.

29:25.029 --> 29:29.978
And the clock is too posh.
That's good.

29:36.829 --> 29:40.529
We are on the Goodwood circuit.

29:40.529 --> 29:45.229
It's where Stirling Moss nearly
died, and Bruce McLaren did.

29:45.229 --> 29:48.369
And this is a 1000 horsepower car.

29:48.369 --> 29:53.511
I thought I'd smoke this cigar
and talk about luxury.

29:53.969 --> 29:57.587
RELAXING PIANO MUSIC

30:01.229 --> 30:04.619
Luxury is the new performance.

30:11.599 --> 30:15.889
They've got it spot-on.
It's what a Cadillac should be.

30:15.889 --> 30:21.309
It's big and plush
and probably a bit vulgar.

30:21.309 --> 30:24.589
The Queen has a Bentley.

30:24.589 --> 30:29.589
Gerhard Schroeder won't have it -
he has a Mercedes-Benz.

30:29.589 --> 30:32.069
Elvis can't have it - he's dead.

30:32.069 --> 30:39.839
The real money these days
is with Elton John, David
and Victoria, Puff Diddly...

30:39.839 --> 30:44.014
or Duddly, whatever he's called...
Stuart Hall.

30:48.439 --> 30:52.296
This car is absolutely of its time.

30:55.989 --> 31:00.239
This is what I call shock and awe.
Hammer time!

31:00.239 --> 31:05.529
I've not liked a Cadillac since '57,
and I wasn't born then.

31:05.529 --> 31:09.219
But this is amazing. It's fabulous.

31:09.219 --> 31:16.939
It's stolen the show. It's walked
over the Bentley, which we thought
would be king of the hill.

31:16.939 --> 31:22.399
Can they make it? I didn't say it in
the film, but this is a prototype.

31:22.399 --> 31:29.139
They could make it. It's not pie in
the sky stuff. It's a proper engine.

31:29.139 --> 31:31.539
They could make it.

31:31.539 --> 31:38.439
Can I see the engine? I want to see
it in real life. It would be
powered on the real version.

31:38.439 --> 31:45.439
Americans might lose weight if they
had to do something themselves.
Whe-hey. Where's the propeller?!

31:45.439 --> 31:51.499
It needs one on the front or back.
That's huge - 13.5?

31:51.499 --> 31:54.289
It's 13. 6 litres. 1000bhp.

31:54.289 --> 31:58.559
What will it take for them
to put it into production?

31:58.559 --> 32:04.839
If the people I mentioned, like
Elton, Posh, you and Stuart Hall...

32:04.839 --> 32:11.099
If Stuart Hall... If you ring up
Cadillac and say, "Make that car! "

32:11.099 --> 32:15.239
Stuart, do it.
You'll be the talk of Cheshire.

32:15.239 --> 32:20.119
Usually, when there's anything
about disabled drivers on telly,

32:20.119 --> 32:26.739
it's about someone putting a chair
in their Maestro or it's about
parking close to things.

32:26.739 --> 32:32.799
Not on this show. A few weeks ago,
a guy came into the studio,
in his wheelchair,

32:32.799 --> 32:37.499
and he said he and his mates liked
hammering around a racetrack.

32:37.499 --> 32:40.399
That gave us an idea.

32:40.399 --> 32:44.839
We set out to find Britain's
fastest disabled driver.

32:44.839 --> 32:50.659
We found the drivers and a converted
Porsche 911, and we had a track...

32:50.659 --> 32:52.843
which was wet.

32:56.639 --> 33:02.248
Three, two, one, go!

33:07.319 --> 33:12.849
When you're used to the hand
controls... are you as quick?

33:12.849 --> 33:17.919
People have misconceptions. I think
so. I can brake harder and quicker.

33:17.919 --> 33:22.919
You're on there already, you have
an element of control already.

33:22.919 --> 33:26.389
You're there without moving
your foot.

33:40.409 --> 33:44.299
BEEP! Well held!

33:44.299 --> 33:49.919
"You did that on purpose," -
that's what he's going to say.

33:58.639 --> 34:04.119
I go round and I forget I've got no
lower back muscle - "Bloody hell! "

34:04.119 --> 34:07.930
He needn't worry about breaking
his back!

34:16.469 --> 34:22.032
He's giving it some! Yes. You could
almost take a boat out there now.

34:37.089 --> 34:39.809
ALL: Waaay!

34:39.809 --> 34:42.458
APPLAUSE

34:42.458 --> 34:43.869
Now...

34:43.869 --> 34:49.688
The results - they are as follows.
In sixth place...

34:49.688 --> 34:54.668
Peter, with 2.20. And he crashed
on the way home!

34:54.668 --> 35:01.529
He binned it on the way out.
Tim, you were fourth with 1.58. 08 -
respectable time.

35:01.529 --> 35:04.689
Despite your nearly monster crash!

35:04.689 --> 35:08.689
A proper crash. Rob - 1.55. 06.

35:08.689 --> 35:11.289
That makes you third.

35:11.289 --> 35:15.469
Colin's second with 1.54.08 -
good solid time.

35:15.469 --> 35:19.489
Then a leap to 1.47 -
Lee's first. Well done.

35:19.489 --> 35:22.569
Round of applause.

35:22.569 --> 35:27.017
Look at that. Cheers.

35:35.868 --> 35:39.258
This is the Range Rover 580S,

35:39.258 --> 35:43.348
which has been breathed on
by Overfinch.

35:43.348 --> 35:45.718
It's priced at £45,000,

35:45.718 --> 35:48.539
plus £60,000 for the original car.

35:56.668 --> 35:59.978
What they did
with the old Range Rover

35:59.978 --> 36:05.528
was replace the standard engine
with a 5.7-litre V8 from a Corvette.

36:05.528 --> 36:10.329
It were fun,
if your name was BP Esso McShell.

36:11.388 --> 36:14.138
With the new one, though,

36:14.138 --> 36:17.768
they've stuck
with the standard BMW engine,

36:17.768 --> 36:23.598
buoying it out to five litres and
fitting a very expensive crankshaft.

36:23.598 --> 36:26.829
Think of this as a Range Rover M5.

36:32.468 --> 36:35.338
You get 380 brake horsepower.

36:35.338 --> 36:38.208
That's 100 more than standard!

36:38.208 --> 36:42.568
380 brake horsepower
is what you got from a Ferrari 355.

36:42.568 --> 36:45.888
And they've fiddled
with the gearbox.

36:45.888 --> 36:51.349
When you floor it, it changes down
immediately and you're off.

36:56.288 --> 37:01.988
To demonstrate what all this power
means, I've organised a drag race.

37:07.548 --> 37:13.009
A Mercedes SLK
versus a two-and-a-half ton truck.

37:15.408 --> 37:17.568
And we're not cheating.

37:17.568 --> 37:22.888
This Mercedes has the big engine,
the 3.2-litre V6.

37:22.888 --> 37:28.349
Think of it as a race between
an athlete and someone who's fat.

37:30.468 --> 37:34.008
And to make
the fat man's job harder,

37:34.008 --> 37:36.748
he'll be racing off-road.

37:36.748 --> 37:39.854
ENGINE REVS
Sport mode.

37:42.488 --> 37:45.434
2,000 rpm and...

37:47.848 --> 37:51.008
I'm ahead.

37:51.008 --> 37:53.533
It's getting awfully bumpy!

37:57.428 --> 38:01.467
I'm in the lead.
I've got double vision!

38:04.928 --> 38:06.213
Yes!

38:07.908 --> 38:12.857
And I win! This thing's quick!

38:17.368 --> 38:21.768
On the road, the Overfinch
does 0-60 in 7.1 seconds

38:21.768 --> 38:25.208
and has a top speed of 140.

38:25.208 --> 38:31.078
The only problem is, the steering
and suspension haven't been changed.

38:36.058 --> 38:41.108
It's a bit like sliding down
a black run in a wardrobe.

38:41.108 --> 38:46.535
It's a giggle, but you've got no
real say in the direction of travel.

38:47.648 --> 38:50.178
Wa-hey!

38:50.178 --> 38:54.717
TYRES SCREECH
Wooo-haa!

38:59.978 --> 39:04.578
So, it's not a nimble sports car,
then. More of a Mach four bulldozer.

39:04.578 --> 39:09.768
But the best thing about this car
is not the engine or the gearbox,

39:09.768 --> 39:16.348
or the TV screens in the headrest,
or the hand-stitched leather,
or the fancy wheels.

39:16.348 --> 39:19.138
The best bit is in the boot.

39:19.138 --> 39:23.848
Land Rover say to get seven seats,
you have to buy a Discovery.

39:23.848 --> 39:28.318
It's a business practice
they got from Das Kapital.

39:28.318 --> 39:31.128
But Overfinch are different.

39:31.128 --> 39:35.378
Look! Two seats, with seatbelts,
that fold away.

39:35.378 --> 39:39.978
And some hay for the horses, look.
Isn't that terrific?

39:39.978 --> 39:44.328
The normal Range Rover
is a very good car,

39:44.328 --> 39:48.718
but this is a people-carrying,
Porsche-bashing,

39:48.718 --> 39:52.233
fuel-guzzling,
muscle-bound mountain goat.

40:01.718 --> 40:04.058
Know what this reminds me of?

40:04.058 --> 40:09.338
Remember that Carver we had on?
Yeah. That 45-degree lean thing.

40:09.338 --> 40:14.458
You have to be insane to try and
set a time round the track in this.

40:14.458 --> 40:17.918
Oh, mad!
That'll be a job for the Stig.

40:17.918 --> 40:22.878
Thundering off the line
like big V8 hippopotamus.

40:22.878 --> 40:28.418
The Overfinch has four-wheel drive.
Also weaves as much as a church.

40:28.418 --> 40:32.278
LOUNGE MUSIC

40:32.278 --> 40:38.298
Stig in a suave mood.
Look at the body roll
through Chicago. That is scary!

40:38.298 --> 40:41.348
He's lumbering up to the Hammerhead,

40:41.348 --> 40:44.385
Iooking a bit slow, it must be said.

40:51.078 --> 40:55.488
This thing
is immense in a straight line.

40:55.488 --> 40:58.478
Not so fond of bends, however.

40:58.478 --> 41:01.298
He's gone off-road! Cos he can!

41:01.298 --> 41:04.498
He's gone off-road! Into Gambon.

41:04.498 --> 41:07.478
And across the line

41:07.478 --> 41:12.618
in one minute 44 seconds,
despite the cheat.

41:12.618 --> 41:16.488
The slowest ever.
It sounded good, though.

41:16.488 --> 41:21.478
The Stig said that's the first time
he's been scared behind the wheel!

41:21.478 --> 41:23.908
Really? Marvellous!

41:23.908 --> 41:28.298
Now, the bit
we call the broken biscuit section.

41:28.298 --> 41:32.718
It's all the stuff we said we'd do
and we haven't.

41:32.718 --> 41:36.298
And actually,
since we're standing here,

41:36.298 --> 41:38.948
Iet's stick with the Range Rover.

41:38.948 --> 41:41.818
When it was launched last year,

41:41.818 --> 41:45.228
Land Rover said,
"We're building it properly. "

41:45.228 --> 41:48.578
We said,
"Lend us one for six months.

41:48.578 --> 41:52.748
"We'll run it
and see if anything goes wrong. "

41:52.748 --> 41:59.308
You then went on to say
if anything went wrong,
you'd shoot the MD's dog.

41:59.308 --> 42:04.158
We've had letters from people
who say theirs has gone wrong.

42:04.158 --> 42:07.488
A chap in the audience
just now said,

42:07.488 --> 42:12.108
"I've bought one. " I said, "Is it
here?" He said, "No, it's broken. "

42:12.108 --> 42:17.138
However, the deal was if THIS one
goes wrong, the one they lent us.

42:17.138 --> 42:22.308
We've used it as a Top Gear chase
car... It's disgusting! It is.

42:22.308 --> 42:27.088
Worst test of all, kids' school run.
They treat it like animals.

42:27.088 --> 42:31.998
And here we are, six months on.
And what's the news for the dog?

42:31.998 --> 42:34.788
Last week, it was good.

42:34.788 --> 42:40.188
But just the other day, this is the
electric steering wheel adjuster.

42:40.188 --> 42:43.288
It won't go up and down. Oh, dear!

42:43.288 --> 42:46.628
It's not the thing
you kill a dog over.

42:46.628 --> 42:49.199
We couldn't wound the dog for that.

42:50.908 --> 42:54.728
He didn't want us to show this,
but got a racing licence.

42:54.728 --> 43:01.468
He said, "I'm taking part
in a 24-hour motor race for 2CVs,
in Norfolk. "

43:01.468 --> 43:06.048
Right. Here's the race.
There's the team he assembled.

43:06.048 --> 43:09.188
There's Hammond, the fastest vicar,

43:09.188 --> 43:13.048
the fastest Rasta
and a professional driver.

43:13.048 --> 43:17.268
Beautifully prepared car,
loaned by a family.

43:17.268 --> 43:20.788
Beautifully crafted
so he could take part.

43:20.788 --> 43:25.948
Now, the thing is, as I said,
Hammond isn't a racing driver.

43:25.948 --> 43:28.788
Here he comes, look.

43:28.788 --> 43:33.548
He's got the suit, he's got
the helmet. He's got a romper suit!

43:33.548 --> 43:38.068
It turns out the only aspect
of racing he's good at

43:38.068 --> 43:40.708
is thinking up excuses.

43:40.708 --> 43:42.868
Watch this!

43:42.868 --> 43:47.708
He broke the car. It wasn't me.
He forgot to tell me. Nice one!

43:47.708 --> 43:52.988
Every time I braked, the gearbox
and lever was moving forward.

43:52.988 --> 43:55.978
It didn't half wobble.

43:55.978 --> 44:00.748
Blew the engine. I'd have been,
you know, a fast time. Blitzed!

44:00.748 --> 44:06.708
Probably a 1.45 was on the cards.
Now you've got the perfect excuse!

44:06.708 --> 44:11.478
He blamed just about everything
there! I don't think he...

44:11.478 --> 44:16.508
Here he is. Yeah, well,
it was tricky. Did the tyres go off?

44:16.508 --> 44:19.548
They were going to. You forgot them!

44:19.548 --> 44:24.678
Did you have a reliability problem?
Where did you come? 13th. 13th?

44:24.678 --> 44:28.668
About 14 or so...
You were second to last!

44:28.668 --> 44:33.448
You're useless! You're not being
allowed to do any more motor racing.

44:33.448 --> 44:36.788
We never thought
we'd have to do this.

44:36.788 --> 44:42.448
We thought Jay Kay would sit on top
of our celebrity board for ever.

44:42.448 --> 44:45.358
But two weeks ago, this happened.

44:45.358 --> 44:50.668
Jodie Kidd came here. I'm sure
you remember what the result was.

44:50.668 --> 44:53.705
CHEERING

44:56.548 --> 44:59.398
She beat Jay Kay by 0.3 of a second,

44:59.398 --> 45:02.198
making her the fastest person,

45:02.198 --> 45:06.416
the fastest
star in a reasonably priced car.

45:06.416 --> 45:09.276
Sadly, she can't be here tonight.

45:09.276 --> 45:12.106
We're going to a pub where she is.

45:12.106 --> 45:15.216
Thank you.

45:15.216 --> 45:18.826
This is gonna go high up
above my fire.

45:18.826 --> 45:21.776
It's gonna be there, looking at me.

45:21.776 --> 45:24.506
I'm very proud of it.

45:24.506 --> 45:27.596
This plasticness is beautiful!

45:27.596 --> 45:32.106
I'd just like to thank my agent,
my family...

45:32.106 --> 45:34.996
Oh, for God's sake, shut up!

45:34.996 --> 45:38.316
That is it for the end of the show,

45:38.316 --> 45:40.996
and, indeed, the end of the series.

45:40.996 --> 45:45.766
If you have any opinions about the
show, do keep them to yourselves!

45:45.766 --> 45:47.597
Good night.
