I mean, what's he doing up there?

03:50.440 --> 03:54.228

Anthea, what is he doing?!

03:54.320 --> 03:56.151

05:09.360 --> 05:10.315

Hi, Nips.

'It's a funny name.

05:14.320 --> 05:17.756
'I've seen a few nipples, Nips,

05:17.840 --> 05:19.432
My nipples are not funny, OK?

05:19.520 --> 05:22.557
'That's your opinion. Anyway, you said
you'd help out with Sid today? '

05:22.640 --> 05:23.595
What?!

05:23.680 --> 05:25.033
With Sid. The virgin thing.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.394
You weren't serious?

05:26.480 --> 05:29.950
He's got to pop his cherry and I've
nominated you to, you know, help out.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.998
God, Tony. Do I have to?

05:33.080 --> 05:36.072
You promised. Hang on,
I've got Chris on the line. Stay there.

05:36.160 --> 05:37.752
Whatever.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.273
Yeah, man. You rang?

05:39.360 --> 05:41.191
'Where the fuck is everyone?
It's nine o'clock.'

05:41.280 --> 05:42.838
Oh man, I'm in bed.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.478
Can't you go and get Sid?

05:44.560 --> 05:47.393
I can't. I'm busy.
Busy-busy, you remember?

05:47.480 --> 05:49.710
Ah, Buck Tooth?

05:49.800 --> 05:51.472
Yo!

05:51.560 --> 05:52.709
Give her a big hello from me, yeah?

05:52.800 --> 05:56.873
You already did that, didn't ya.
It's my turn now. All right, laters.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.190
Anyway,
it's not that much to ask, Nips.

05:59.280 --> 06:01.510
Sid's almost 17. He's gotta get laid

06:01.600 --> 06:04.273
before his birthday otherwise
he can't be my friend, obviously.

06:04.360 --> 06:07.352
- What the fuck are you talking about?!
- Sorry, Jal. Wrong call. Can you hold?

06:07.440 --> 06:10.079
- No.
- Perhaps you could help out with Sid's cherry.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.754
'I don't think so! You need someone deaf,
blind and stupid for that.'

06:12.840 --> 06:14.637
- That's unkind.
- Bye, Tony.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.039
Wanna come to a party?

06:16.120 --> 06:18.076
'Goodbye, Tony.
And stop calling Michelle Nips.'

06:18.160 --> 06:20.196
It's a funny name.
She's got a funny nipple...

06:24.240 --> 06:25.229
'You still there? '

06:25.320 --> 06:26.958
- All right.
- 'Huh? '

06:27.040 --> 06:29.554
I'll help Sid if he's so desperate.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.596
'Safe. We'll do it at
the party tonight, yeah.

06:31.680 --> 06:32.908
'Meet us in the cafe so we can plan.'

06:33.000 --> 06:33.955
I have to plan?

Tony?

- Hello, Mr Jenkins. It's Tony.
- 'Hi, Tony. What can we do for you? '

07:14.400 --> 07:18.188
We're a little worried about Sid. He's got
a sociology test in ten minutes and, er...

07:18.280 --> 07:19.679
'What? He's what? '

07:21.880 --> 07:24.155

We've got things to talk about.'

07:33.520 --> 07:34.475
Like what?

07:34.560 --> 07:36.152
- Virgins.
- 'Huh? '

07:36.240 --> 07:37.639
Virgins. Virginity.

07:39.360 --> 07:40.315
Whose?

07:40.400 --> 07:41.355
Yours, you anus.

07:41.440 --> 07:44.591
- I'm listening.
- 'Hang on.'

07:44.680 --> 07:46.193
Tony?

07:46.280 --> 07:48.748
Cheers, Tone. My uncle wants
to stone me to death now.

Sid's getting de-cherried.

07:54.520 --> 07:56.909
Chris promised Maxxie we're gonna
go to his big gay night out.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.274
Is Chris gay?

07:58.360 --> 08:00.032
- No.
- Are you gay?

08:00.120 --> 08:04.272
No. But Maxxie says there's gonna be
lots of hot women there...

08:07.720 --> 08:10.996
...desperate because there's nobody
to shag - except for me and Chris.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.640
Anwar, you dippy twat. Sid's flying
solo down the tunnel of love

08:13.720 --> 08:14.994
and he needs support, yeah?

08:16.240 --> 08:17.434

Sorry, Bruv. Big, gay night out.
Me and the lads.

08:29.520 --> 08:30.748
The lads?

08:30.840 --> 08:34.071
Yeah. I'm going to take them on
a voyage of wonder and discovery.

08:34.159 --> 08:37.869
'Fuck that!
Look, Max - for Christ sakes! '

08:37.960 --> 08:40.474
Can you stop fucking tap dancing?
I can't hear myself think.

08:40.559 --> 08:43.279
Sorry, Tone. Gotta get these moves.
You know - for the show.

08:43.360 --> 08:45.191
Do they have tap dancing
in Death Of A Salesman?

08:45.280 --> 08:48.033
It needs a number.
I've always said that.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.429
'Anyway, meet me on the green
before psychology.'

08:50.520 --> 08:52.112

rubbish food and too much caffeine.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.192

You finally get the VIP tour
of Netherland. You finally...

10:03.080 --> 10:04.593
Fuck off! "Finally".

10:04.680 --> 10:07.240
It's embarrassing.

10:07.320 --> 10:09.959
It's common and quite normal
for someone of 16 to...

10:10.040 --> 10:13.271
No. It's embarrassing, Sid.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.510
Shit.

10:15.600 --> 10:16.669
All right. How?

10:16.760 --> 10:20.036
We go to the party and we get a girl
catastrophically spliffed up.

10:20.120 --> 10:24.796
In her confused state, she comes to
believe, however momentarily,

10:24.880 --> 10:26.074
that you're attractive enough to shag.

10:26.160 --> 10:30.073
- Who's the lucky girl, then?
- I think you're gonna like this.

10:31.760 --> 10:36.231
Oh, yes. You are a very,
very lucky little boy.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.119
Michelle?

10:51.200 --> 10:53.668
I'm gonna do it with Michelle?

10:53.760 --> 10:56.752
- Hang on, Sid.
- I'm gonna dock the ferry with Michelle.

10:56.840 --> 11:00.355
Cheers, Tony. You don't know what...

11:00.440 --> 11:03.477
Hi.

11:03.560 --> 11:06.120
...what this means.

11:22.880 --> 11:27.237
Are we getting me laid or shall I just start
filming and take it back for private time?

11:27.320 --> 11:29.436
All right. Who's stupid enough
to fuck Sid?

11:29.520 --> 11:30.475
Cassie.

11:30.560 --> 11:32.039
She's still in hospital.

11:32.120 --> 11:35.476
They let her out. She's just
not allowed to handle knives.

11:37.680 --> 11:38.999
All right. She'll do.

11:39.080 --> 11:40.877
We're gonna need a lot of drugs.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.076
Get an ounce.
We can sell it at the party.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.310
I've got to get an ounce of spliff?

11:45.400 --> 11:49.518
There's this guy who'll sell on tick.
Tell him we'll pay tomorrow.

11:49.600 --> 11:50.953
But why don't you go?

11:51.040 --> 11:54.077
Got tai chi, then my choir audition,
then psychology.

11:54.160 --> 11:56.196
Cassie's great in the sack.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.111
As long as she's not hungry.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.235

11:59.320 --> 12:00.912
(Both) Everyone.

12:04.480 --> 12:06.835
OK, fuck it. What's this guy's name?

12:08.440 --> 12:09.589
It's all on there.

12:18.080 --> 12:20.355

She's coming, right?

I say this world extends way beyond this field
of dreams. And I want to see that world.

17:46.080 --> 17:47.308
What the fuck's he on about?

17:47.400 --> 17:49.197
He's quoting. It's a literary reference.

17:49.280 --> 17:50.952
What? You mean Shakespeare and shit?

17:51.040 --> 17:52.632
Dawson's Creek.

I don't know what that is, but if you guys
want to waste your life watching television...

17:57.680 --> 18:01.559
- You don't watch television, Chris?
- No, I don't watch television, you braindeads.

Can you not think of anything better
to entertain yourselves?

No.

It fucking is cultural.

You're full of shit. Nobody's gonna
shag you with a cock that tiny.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.470

You shouldn't have got it out, Chris.

Look, we don't need any.
The town's awash.

19:26.880 --> 19:30.429
No. Do you think he'll be long?

19:30.520 --> 19:32.670
Not once I burst in all
flummoxed up, he won't.

No, I meant the guy I came to see.

19:36.160 --> 19:37.115

Right.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.874
He's sensitive, you know.

21:46.160 --> 21:47.479

I could get the stuff, and pay, like...

24:06.640 --> 24:09.791

27:25.240 --> 27:26.434
Jesus. Is that it?

27:26.520 --> 27:30.593
Yup. It's Abigail's party. And we've
got to sell an ounce of dope.

27:30.680 --> 27:32.477
I was meaning to talk to you...

27:32.560 --> 27:36.758
So we tell them it's like,
Mongolian Hallucinogenic or something.

27:36.840 --> 27:39.718
They're all so dim
they might just buy it.

27:39.800 --> 27:42.360
- Yes, but you see, that's the thing.
- Tony!

27:43.480 --> 27:45.550
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.589
Where is everyone?

27:56.680 --> 28:00.719
Not coming. And Sid has to sell
or he's in shit with his dealer.

28:00.800 --> 28:02.028
Hang on. "My dealer"?

28:02.120 --> 28:05.669
Anyway, I brought Cassie.
Cassie, you remember Sid, right?

28:05.760 --> 28:10.880
Yeah, wow, lovely... No.
But I like that you're funny-Iooking.

28:10.960 --> 28:14.077
That's cute - like, wow, man.

28:14.160 --> 28:17.118
- How's the treatment going, Cassie?
- Oh, it's cool.

28:17.200 --> 28:21.273
I wear a white dress
and now I can eat yoghurt,

28:21.360 --> 28:23.954
Cup-a-Soup and hazelnuts now.

28:24.040 --> 28:26.918
I'm not sick if they let me
play with the cats.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.797
Yeah, it's like...

28:30.680 --> 28:34.150
...hazy days, you know.

28:34.240 --> 28:36.754
Well, that's encouraging.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.991
Oh, thank you. You're so nice.

28:41.200 --> 28:46.991
Cass, Cass, Cass! Sid's going
to be looking <i>after</i> you tonight.

28:47.080 --> 28:50.117
Oh, would you? Wow!

28:50.200 --> 28:51.997
And Sid's got a whole bag of drugs.

28:52.080 --> 28:53.559
Wow!

28:53.640 --> 28:56.234
That's so nice.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.754
And I bet you won't even
make me eat anything.

28:58.840 --> 29:01.070
No. No.

29:01.160 --> 29:03.196
Thank you.

29:05.960 --> 29:09.350
Right, great! Let's go in
and <i>shift</i> this ounce, then, yeah?

29:09.440 --> 29:12.716
It's three ounces.

29:12.800 --> 29:14.074
I got three ounces.

29:20.360 --> 29:21.759
Hi, Abi.

29:21.840 --> 29:24.832
Tony! Lovely.

29:24.920 --> 29:26.558
And these must be your frands.

29:26.640 --> 29:27.595
Sorry?

29:27.680 --> 29:30.353
Yeah, this is Michelle,
Cassie and Sid.

29:30.440 --> 29:31.589
Super.

29:31.680 --> 29:33.477
Wow, you're lovely.

29:33.560 --> 29:34.629
Super.

29:34.720 --> 29:37.439
Where's the kitchen?
I want to see the kitchen.

29:37.520 --> 29:40.239
It's through there. Come in.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.753
Cheers.

29:46.240 --> 29:48.231
Oh... shoes.

29:48.320 --> 29:51.357
It's just that Mummy had this carpet
imported from Iran.

29:51.440 --> 29:53.351
We have to be so,
so careful with the pile.

29:53.440 --> 29:55.715
Right, yep, sure.

29:55.800 --> 29:56.949
Sorry.

29:57.040 --> 29:58.473
(Tony) No problem.

30:04.320 --> 30:06.197
Can I get you some rum punch?

30:06.280 --> 30:09.477
I'm afraid we're getting rather
giggly on it - isn't that safe!

30:09.560 --> 30:12.757
Mmm, we love rum punch,
don't we, Chelle?

- Sid.

30:32.200 --> 30:34.668
Sid? Is that Polish or something?

30:34.760 --> 30:36.910
No, I don't think so.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.831
Danuta's Polish. Danuta.

30:41.280 --> 30:43.111
She doesn't speak English.

30:43.200 --> 30:46.192
But you can just speak to her
in Italian or in French.

31:03.680 --> 31:04.999
She likes you.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.957
Oh. Cheers.

31:07.040 --> 31:12.831
Abi, I wonder if you and your friends
would like a little something?

31:12.920 --> 31:14.319
Something?

31:14.400 --> 31:16.038
You know, get a bit squiffy.

31:16.120 --> 31:19.112
Oh, ya, that would
be so safe, you know.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.839
Great, because we've got some
really cool shit which would get you...

31:21.920 --> 31:25.037
- But we can't smoke anything in the hice.
- The "hice"?

31:25.120 --> 31:29.557
Yes, because the silk wallpaper's just
arrived from Rome, and Mummy's particular

31:29.640 --> 31:32.950
about odours, and we simply
mustn't, or she'll go wild.

31:33.040 --> 31:34.951

Right. Are you hungry or something?

33:01.840 --> 33:05.037
Oh, no. You mustn't eat it.

33:05.920 --> 33:07.672
Just... arrange it.

33:11.600 --> 33:14.558
They haven't got it organised
properly at all.

33:14.640 --> 33:16.676
There.

That's it. Much better.

Cool.

So... are you going to fuck me later?

33:29.840 --> 33:32.195
Pardon?

33:32.280 --> 33:34.510
You know. Like Michelle said.

33:34.600 --> 33:36.795
She said that?

33:36.880 --> 33:38.199
Oh, yes.

33:41.680 --> 33:43.875
Look, I've got all this fucking weed.

33:43.960 --> 33:46.269
Do you want a spliff or something?

33:46.360 --> 33:48.191
No.

33:48.280 --> 33:49.998
I can't.

33:50.080 --> 33:51.991
It makes you hungry.

33:52.080 --> 33:55.152
- Well, I don't mind.
- I do.

33:58.960 --> 34:00.359

35:07.760 --> 35:08.875

she totally loves him even though

38:00.120 --> 38:01.599

I won't mind.

38:53.840 --> 38:56.149
But you'll have to be quick.

38:56.240 --> 38:58.310
Why?

38:59.920 --> 39:01.353
Because...

39:03.400 --> 39:05.994
...I took a shit load of pills.

39:06.080 --> 39:07.195
Pills?

39:07.280 --> 39:08.474
What kind of pills?

40:29.760 --> 40:31.637
Come on, Tony, we need a doctor.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.199

I don't know, improvise.
Go on, we've got to stash the car.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.315

Wow.

41:25.160 --> 41:26.957
Get it out.

41:27.040 --> 41:30.476
We can at least some spliffs before
you're taken out and debollocked.

41:30.560 --> 41:33.472
Oh, nice. Thanks Tone.

41:33.560 --> 41:35.994
Relax. We'll sell it tomorrow.

41:36.080 --> 41:37.195
Where?

41:37.280 --> 41:38.759
We just will.

41:38.840 --> 41:43.197
I like the boats. They go places.

41:44.360 --> 41:47.272
Like over the sea and everything.

41:49.440 --> 41:52.398
Are you OK, Anwar?

41:52.480 --> 41:55.756
Shut up. I can't fucking pee
if you're looking.

41:59.320 --> 42:00.548
You're looking, aren't you?

42:00.640 --> 42:02.437

all our bad luck for today.

42:17.280 --> 42:18.838
You put them in your back pocket.

42:18.920 --> 42:20.672
- When?
- Come here.

42:20.760 --> 42:24.958
Hang on.
There. Yeah, I got them.

42:27.560 --> 42:28.515
Tony!

42:32.840 --> 42:34.034
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

42:48.640 --> 42:49.595
Oh, my God!

42:57.720 --> 42:59.312
Tony!

42:59.400 --> 43:04.110
I think that could have gone
a lot worse, don't you?

43:08.160 --> 43:10.515
The dope's gone.

43:10.600 --> 43:13.160
At least we've got our health.

43:13.240 --> 43:14.878
That's the important thing.

43:23.520 --> 43:27.513
<i>Chicken feet scratch out a beat</i>

43:27.600 --> 43:31.229
<i>While head rolls on the ground</i>

43:33.000 --> 43:37.039
<i>Lookin' for a piece of meat</i>

43:37.120 --> 43:40.715
<i>And sleep in eiderdown</i>

43:48.240 --> 43:54.190
<i>I walked a million miles</i>

43:57.520 --> 44:00.478
<i>I crawled a million more...</i>

44:00.560 --> 44:02.994
For God's sakes,

44:03.080 --> 44:05.230
what are you doing, Miriam?

44:05.320 --> 44:07.390
Why do you have to get up so early?

44:07.480 --> 44:09.152
Just getting ready.

44:09.240 --> 44:13.552
Anybody would think you wanted
the neighbours to see you.

44:13.640 --> 44:15.153
Do you hear me, woman?

44:17.360 --> 44:18.429
Yes, darling.

44:22.040 --> 44:23.632
Tony.

44:23.720 --> 44:24.914
Yes, Sid.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.037
Chris and that Polish girl.

44:28.120 --> 44:30.918
They got out of the car
at the hospital, right?

44:31.000 --> 44:34.390
I mean, they got out
before the harbour, yeah?

44:36.560 --> 44:37.595
Yeah.

44:39.200 --> 44:40.997
Yeah.

44:41.080 --> 44:42.752
Yeah.

44:48.440 --> 44:50.317
You still a virgin, then?

44:52.040 --> 44:53.473
Yup.
