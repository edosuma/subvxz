WEBVTT

00:04.713 --> 00:06.840
Hey, Sum! Freddy, 'sup?

00:07.215 --> 00:10.093
I'm getting ready for class,
he's just hanging.

00:11.344 --> 00:13.471
Hey, Kale, I got you a surprise.

00:13.763 --> 00:15.098
Your favourite compost!

00:15.223 --> 00:17.475
Aw, you got the good worms and everything!

00:17.559 --> 00:19.894
That's so romantic.

00:20.979 --> 00:26.401
Look at them, he gave her worms!
They're like, an official couple now.

00:27.110 --> 00:29.362
My dog gave me worms
and we're not a couple!

00:30.238 --> 00:32.407
Still got your Freddy-Kale rash?

00:32.741 --> 00:35.952
I think it's just a coincidence that
it pops up every time I see them together.

00:36.036 --> 00:39.039
Maybe it shows up whenever you lie
to yourself. Who knows?

00:40.165 --> 00:41.332
You're right!

00:41.416 --> 00:45.044
I'm tired of being defined
by this one-way relationship.

00:45.128 --> 00:48.339
I am better than that.
This picture is coming down!

00:58.600 --> 01:00.101
I just wasted a drum roll.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.561
Baby steps!

01:06.149 --> 01:09.110
During tomorrow's total lunar eclipse,
the earth's shadow will

01:09.194 --> 01:11.946
block the sun's light from shining
on the moon.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.616
-This is called syzygy.
-Awesome!

01:14.699 --> 01:19.537
[Finn] Cool! Also, when the moon is dark,
werewolves lose their powers.

01:21.331 --> 01:22.999
Does it really say the werewolf part?

01:23.249 --> 01:26.669
That's just common sense.
Use your head, Zack!

01:27.420 --> 01:30.173
We can all watch the eclipse
during tomorrow night's school lock-in!

01:30.256 --> 01:32.217
Yeah! Wait, what's the lock-in?

01:32.842 --> 01:34.761
It's a sleepover, but at school!

01:34.844 --> 01:37.514
Yes, and I just want
to remind everyone that according

01:37.597 --> 01:39.265
to the new school lock-in rules,

01:39.349 --> 01:42.936
appropriate sleepwear includes tops,
and bottoms.

01:44.020 --> 01:46.231
Last year was an honest mistake.

01:46.856 --> 01:49.692
This lock in, there's only one thing
on our agenda.

01:49.984 --> 01:52.362
[both] Find the pudding room!

01:52.695 --> 01:55.240
That's an urban myth,
like alligators in the sewers.

01:55.323 --> 01:56.407
Or all-you-can-eat shrimp.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.034
There is a cut-off, people!

01:58.493 --> 02:00.787
Sure, there are non-believers,

02:01.079 --> 02:02.997
people who say there is
no hidden room filled

02:03.081 --> 02:04.124
with years' worth of pudding.

02:04.207 --> 02:07.293
But I, for one, don't want
to live in a world without pudding rooms.

02:08.586 --> 02:11.339
Freddy, join us on our pudding quest.

02:11.506 --> 02:13.967
Nah, I've got to hang with Kale.
We're gonna play some games!

02:14.050 --> 02:15.260
Maybe do some quilting.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.512
I really hope it's games.

02:19.347 --> 02:21.766
So, I guess we should skip the lock in,
huh?

02:21.850 --> 02:23.726
You don't want to be locked in
with Freddy and Kale

02:23.810 --> 02:25.979
and all their happiness and planet saving.

02:26.604 --> 02:29.899
Maybe that's exactly what I need
to do to get over my rash!

02:29.983 --> 02:32.652
Force myself to be
around them the entire time!

02:33.403 --> 02:35.530
Total Freddy-Kale immersion!

02:35.738 --> 02:37.740
Or we could skip it,
watch internet prom fails,

02:37.824 --> 02:38.825
and eat flautas.

02:39.617 --> 02:42.495
Flautas?! Who is eating flautas?!
I want flautas!

02:43.204 --> 02:46.291
-Me... when you guys are at the lock-in.
-Hmm.

02:46.457 --> 02:48.585
Yeah, Tomika's mom is really strict.

02:48.668 --> 02:51.045
She's never let Tomika sleep anywhere
but her own house

02:51.129 --> 02:52.589
as long as I've known her.

02:52.922 --> 02:54.007
Want me to talk to her?

02:54.090 --> 02:55.091
-Yes!
-No!

02:55.174 --> 02:56.175
Seriously, let me call her.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.260
-No!
-Yes!

02:58.761 --> 03:00.096
Fine, here's the number.

03:03.266 --> 03:06.853
Um, on a totally unrelated note,
I need to use the restroom, bye.

03:09.564 --> 03:10.982
[cellphone ringing]

03:12.066 --> 03:14.068
Hi, is this Tomika's mom?

03:14.235 --> 03:16.404
Yes, indeed-y-doo!

03:17.155 --> 03:19.574
Uh, this is her teacher, Mr. Finn.

03:19.699 --> 03:20.909
I was hoping you'd let your daughter

03:20.992 --> 03:23.244
participate in the lock in.
It's going to be fun,

03:23.328 --> 03:27.373
and if you were at all concerned,
the werewolf threat is incredibly low.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.001
Sorry, Mr. Finn.

03:30.084 --> 03:34.672
Tomika can't sleep anywhere but home,
and that's all I have to say,

03:34.923 --> 03:37.383
as Tomika's actual mom.

03:37.842 --> 03:39.761
You mom sounds super nice.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.139
Wanna tell me what's going on?

03:43.681 --> 03:48.603
Look, it's embarrassing,
but I'm scared to sleep away from home.

03:49.187 --> 03:51.940
People think I'm all tough,
but this is my weak spot.

03:52.148 --> 03:54.025
I haven't even told Summer about it.

03:54.275 --> 03:57.779
Wow. One, that's serious.

03:58.279 --> 04:01.991
Two, this makes us best friends!

04:03.785 --> 04:07.705
One, yes, it is. And two, no, we're not!

04:09.374 --> 04:10.750
I can help you!

04:10.959 --> 04:13.211
I've gotten lots of people
over their fears.

04:13.294 --> 04:17.006
One friend was afraid of water,
and now he's a great swimmer.

04:17.257 --> 04:21.511
Another was afraid of flying,
and now he's a world traveler.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.722
This one guy was terrified of snakes.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.099
And now he's--

04:26.182 --> 04:28.309
Paralyzed on the left side
of his body from snake venom.

04:28.393 --> 04:32.230
That's a bad example. Look,
I promise I can get you through it.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.399
-Really?
-Absolutely!

04:34.482 --> 04:37.110
And don't worry,
everyone's afraid of something.

04:37.318 --> 04:39.904
I used to be deathly afraid of ladybugs.

04:39.988 --> 04:43.658
And now, I know they're harmless,
beautiful creatures.

04:43.741 --> 04:45.535
That's funny,
there's one on your shoulder!

04:45.618 --> 04:49.122
[screaming] Ah, ladybug!
Augh, it's laying eggs in my eyes!

Oh, just my trusty air mattress, Alberto.

05:29.704 --> 05:30.997
You named your air mattress?

05:31.080 --> 05:33.875
Oh, no, it's named
after the man who died on it.

05:37.378 --> 05:38.838
What's with the giant suitcase?

05:39.047 --> 05:41.466
We're not going to find the pudding room
without the right equipment.

05:41.799 --> 05:43.384
Yeah, but we gotta be sneaky.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.094
No problem, let's go.

05:45.386 --> 05:46.929
[crashing]

05:48.765 --> 05:50.141
We've gotta work on our sneaky.

05:51.809 --> 05:54.395
Aww, you guys got here at the same time!

05:54.479 --> 05:57.190
We carbon-pooled.
That's a carbon-free carpool.

05:58.149 --> 05:59.484
She means we walked.

06:00.401 --> 06:02.236
This lock-in is so exciting!

06:02.320 --> 06:04.781
You guys are hanging out,
and I'm hanging out with you,

06:04.947 --> 06:06.324
and it won't be weird and awkward because,

06:06.407 --> 06:09.577
why would it be? You're a couple,
and I'm like, your cool third wheel!

06:13.915 --> 06:16.542
Well, this wheel's gotta roll.
Catch you later!

06:20.088 --> 06:22.673
Okay, your mom said
this is your favourite pillow,

06:22.757 --> 06:26.135
you got your new sleeping bag,
you should be awesome!

06:26.427 --> 06:27.970
You don't get it, Mr. Finn.

06:28.054 --> 06:32.016
I'm never going to be able
to fall asleep-- without--

06:33.601 --> 06:34.852
Without this?

06:37.230 --> 06:39.232
Hair curlers and a mud mask?

06:39.857 --> 06:42.527
Oh, no, wrong box. That's mine.

06:42.610 --> 06:43.986
This takes work.

06:44.695 --> 06:47.657
I mean, without this.

06:49.617 --> 06:50.868
My Wubby!

06:53.121 --> 06:54.372
Your mom dropped it off.

06:54.455 --> 06:58.167
And by the way, your impression of her,
spot on!

06:59.418 --> 07:02.213
My Wubby's name is Pam Lamb.
Sometimes Pammy,

07:02.296 --> 07:04.382
Pam-a-lamb-a-ding-dong
when we're just chillaxing.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.927
But people can't see me with her,
they'll make fun of me!

07:08.094 --> 07:10.805
Well, just keep her in the box,
and when it's time to go to bed,

07:10.888 --> 07:12.390
you can hide her in your sleeping bag.

07:12.473 --> 07:13.474
Easy-peasy!

07:14.225 --> 07:16.185
This just might work, Mr. Finn!

07:16.644 --> 07:19.772
We just have to keep ourselves distracted
and stay busy until bedtime.

07:20.857 --> 07:21.858
[screaming]

07:22.984 --> 07:24.402
Wanna get your mud on, girl?

07:24.902 --> 07:26.195
No, not really?

07:26.320 --> 07:27.655
Is this supposed to burn?

07:33.995 --> 07:39.333
According to my calculations,
if we drill right here, we strike pudding.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.503
Then we're back in time for the eclipse.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.176
This is the biggest moment of our lives.

07:49.343 --> 07:51.345
Promise me the pudding won't change us.

07:52.930 --> 07:55.558
You know I can't make that promise. Drill!

08:03.316 --> 08:04.484
What do you see?!

08:21.209 --> 08:25.421
Oh, the blueprints were upside down,
that's a water pipe!

08:29.091 --> 08:31.511
You never want to watch an eclipse
on an empty stomach,

08:31.594 --> 08:35.139
so Tomika and I are going
to show you how to make s'mores a la Finn.

08:35.556 --> 08:39.393
Graham cracker. Marshmallow. Chocolate.

08:39.685 --> 08:40.853
Graham cracker.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.567
All we can do now is wait.

08:49.028 --> 08:52.323
Mr. Finn, why are you using a flat iron
to make s'mores?

08:52.448 --> 08:54.492
Because I've been told
on three different occasions

08:54.575 --> 08:57.870
that you can't have a campfire
in a classroom. Or fireworks.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.372
Or deep fry a turkey.

08:59.580 --> 09:00.957
Pfft, school.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.584
How's the Freddy-Kale total immersion?

09:03.751 --> 09:07.046
Pretty good, I've got one spot here
that doesn't have a rash.

09:08.130 --> 09:09.674
Spoke too soon.

09:13.427 --> 09:16.722
-Ooh, what's this box?
-Uh, nothing.

09:17.306 --> 09:18.641
Feels like something.

09:18.724 --> 09:21.143
I said it's nothing,
why can't you believe my lies?

09:23.771 --> 09:24.981
Pam Lamb?!

09:25.064 --> 09:26.274
Shh!

09:26.941 --> 09:29.110
You said you gave it away
to a scared baby!

09:29.193 --> 09:31.612
I did! I'm that scared baby.

09:33.864 --> 09:37.368
So, all this time when you told me
your mom wouldn't let you stay over,

09:37.451 --> 09:39.787
that was a lie? It wasn't true?

09:40.079 --> 09:41.455
You weren't being honest?

09:41.539 --> 09:44.166
You don't have to keep saying
the same thing in different ways.

09:44.458 --> 09:47.712
I was embarrassed, humiliated. Mortified.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.005
See how it feels?

09:50.464 --> 09:52.633
Look, I'm your best friend.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.720
You could tell me anything,
and I would never make fun of you.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.139
I'm going to help you get
through the sleepover.

09:58.472 --> 09:59.640
No.

10:01.309 --> 10:05.187
You've got more important things to do.
Like break up with that picture of Freddy.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.481
Are you sure you're going to be okay?

10:07.815 --> 10:11.819
Yeah, Mr. Finn has been taking care of me.
He's been a really calming influence.

10:12.236 --> 10:13.237
[screaming]

10:14.488 --> 10:19.285
Melted chocolate! It burns!
Totally worth it!

10:23.331 --> 10:25.207
So, I was thinking we could play a game.
There's a pretty epic--

10:25.291 --> 10:28.294
Oh no, a poor, helpless hornet,
we have to save it!

10:28.794 --> 10:29.795
Why?!

10:30.171 --> 10:32.089
Hey, guys, what are you doing?

10:32.173 --> 10:34.383
Something adorable
that I'm totally cool with?

10:34.467 --> 10:35.885
We're setting a hornet free.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.846
I got it, open the window!

10:39.180 --> 10:40.890
Ow, stinging, ow!

10:40.973 --> 10:43.267
Oh, you poor thing!
I'm sure he doesn't mean it.

10:43.517 --> 10:45.895
That's so sweet. Seriously,
open the window.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.063
Oh, right!

10:49.649 --> 10:51.108
Let me pull the stinger out.

10:52.693 --> 10:54.737
-All better.
-Now I am.

10:55.446 --> 10:59.742
Oh, boy, major breakout.
That was a fun 47 seconds.

11:00.117 --> 11:03.746
You know, I'd love to hang out,
but I forgot, I have to... go with Asher!

11:04.038 --> 11:06.624
There you are, you were looking for me,
right?

11:06.916 --> 11:09.210
Um, I'm going to the boys' bathroom.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.712
-Yup, that was our plan. Let's go!
-Huh?

11:14.715 --> 11:16.175
[sighing]

11:27.520 --> 11:29.438
-Excuse me, Mr. Finn?
-Huh?

11:29.522 --> 11:31.941
I was told that there were some
school rule books in your class?

11:32.191 --> 11:34.693
Oh, yeah, they're in a box on the floor.

11:34.902 --> 11:37.571
I'd help you, but I'm busy
with important teacher stuff.

11:37.655 --> 11:38.656
[laughing]

11:39.073 --> 11:40.866
I thought I'd hand these out
at the sing-a-long.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.618
You know, in case it gets too fun.

11:46.288 --> 11:49.583
Hey, Mr. Finn. I'm just here to check
on my special friend.

11:49.750 --> 11:50.835
Aw, that' so sweet!

11:51.252 --> 11:53.963
Except for this paper thing
I've got going on, I'm pretty good.

11:58.551 --> 12:02.972
Uh, Mr. Finn, it's gone!
My wubby was in the box, where is it?

12:03.097 --> 12:05.015
Ah, I think I know what happened.

12:05.099 --> 12:07.351
I'll take care of it,
you're in good hands.

12:09.103 --> 12:11.772
[grunting]

12:13.107 --> 12:14.233
Elbows never fail.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.111
Maybe a shoulder? No.

12:22.658 --> 12:23.993
I loosened it.

12:30.583 --> 12:35.463
We can't find Clark, we can't find Pam,
the moon is getting eaten by the sun,

12:35.546 --> 12:37.298
this is why I sleep at home!

12:37.590 --> 12:42.219
Tomika! I have seen you land
a million crazy skateboard tricks.

12:42.303 --> 12:45.389
And then get in front of a crowd
of strangers and sing your heart out.

12:45.681 --> 12:48.601
I know you can make it
through one night away from home.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.394
I believe in you.

12:50.561 --> 12:51.937
That's sweet of you, Mr. Finn.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.274
I need Pam Lamb now!

12:56.942 --> 12:59.278
Well,
we found a lot of interesting things,

12:59.361 --> 13:00.779
but still no pudding room!

13:00.863 --> 13:04.742
I know, we missed the whole lock in,
we're going to miss the eclipse,

13:04.825 --> 13:08.662
and all we have to show for it is
this stupid diamond encrusted skull!

13:09.830 --> 13:13.959
[music playing]

13:14.043 --> 13:15.044
Look!

13:16.962 --> 13:23.969
[music playing]

13:24.678 --> 13:25.888
[both] Whoa!

13:32.019 --> 13:34.230
You think anyone will notice
if a few cups are missing?

13:34.813 --> 13:36.774
It's pudding time.

13:38.859 --> 13:41.403
And that's when she said
"let's make a quilt from this garbage."

13:41.529 --> 13:43.364
And that's when he said
"I've never quilted before,

13:43.447 --> 13:44.448
but I'll do it."

13:44.532 --> 13:48.327
-[Freddy] And that's when she said "aww."
-And that's when he said "aww" back!

13:48.410 --> 13:51.747
-Aww!
-And that's when you said "aww!"

13:51.830 --> 13:52.873
And now, we're here!

13:53.207 --> 13:55.501
Hey, Summer,
I'm going to go to the bathroom again.

13:55.584 --> 13:58.379
You seemed real interested last time,
so I figured I'd just let you know,

13:58.462 --> 13:59.463
in case you wanted to come with.

14:00.881 --> 14:03.133
Hey, you know what, my rash is gone!

14:03.551 --> 14:05.302
Uh, congratulations!

14:05.594 --> 14:08.347
I'm actually fine staying here.
Thanks, Asher.

14:08.430 --> 14:09.515
You can go to the bathroom on your own.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.141
Okay, I'll be honest.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.769
That is exactly the answer
I was hoping for.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.147
So, are you guys going
to check out the eclipse later?

14:17.231 --> 14:18.649
Yeah, I can't wait to see it.

14:18.732 --> 14:20.693
No, we're going to finish our quilt.

14:20.776 --> 14:23.320
I meant no, I'd rather quilt garbage.

14:32.538 --> 14:37.918
There... is so much pudding...
inside of me.

14:38.919 --> 14:40.170
I can't get up.

14:40.796 --> 14:43.132
This must be what a jelly fish feels like.

14:43.799 --> 14:46.010
I may have become semi-aquatic.

14:46.927 --> 14:50.556
Am I sweating pudding?
I feel like I'm sweating pudding.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.517
-We should stop.
-Oh, absolutely.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.186
Let's end the madness.

15:08.616 --> 15:11.911
Give me the pudding! Give it to me!
It's mine!

15:22.129 --> 15:23.797
[sighing]

15:24.715 --> 15:25.758
Tomeeks!

15:25.841 --> 15:26.926
What, nothing!

15:28.844 --> 15:29.845
Are you okay?

15:30.512 --> 15:34.224
Pam Lamb was missing, but I found her,
she's fine, I'm fine. Everything's fine!

15:34.642 --> 15:36.560
Good, I'm fine, too.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.065
I'm ready to say goodbye to locker Freddy.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.776
I'll stay. In case he makes a scene.

15:46.487 --> 15:48.030
Well, here it goes!

15:53.827 --> 15:56.497
Saying goodbye
to the hair is always the hardest part.

15:56.830 --> 15:57.831
I know.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.132
I'm proud of you, girl.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.176
Hug time!

16:11.178 --> 16:13.847
Well, it's almost time for the eclipse,
want to come?

16:14.139 --> 16:17.184
I can't, I need to go hide Pam Lamb
in my sleeping bag.

16:17.267 --> 16:20.437
Okay, well, sleep tight!
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

16:20.521 --> 16:21.522
The what?!

16:24.525 --> 16:26.527
Hey, Tomika, what you got there?

16:26.819 --> 16:28.862
Nothing! What are you talking about?

16:28.988 --> 16:30.489
I'm talking about somebody

16:30.572 --> 16:34.034
who needs a little baby wubby
to go night-night!

16:34.410 --> 16:35.411
[laughing]

16:38.664 --> 16:39.707
Hey, Summer!

16:40.082 --> 16:43.502
Oh, hey, I didn't think you were coming.
Are you done with your garbage quilt?

16:43.752 --> 16:46.839
The thing about garbage quilts is,
it's really hard to tell when you're done.

16:48.132 --> 16:49.383
Check it out!

16:51.719 --> 16:55.597
[Freddy] Whoa, that's pretty awesome!
The moon looks so red.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.683
Yeah, it's called a Blood Moon.

16:57.975 --> 16:59.977
I didn't know you were into astronomy,
too.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.895
Oh, yeah,
for a little while when I was eight,

17:01.979 --> 17:06.025
I wanted people to call me Cassiopeia,
but they just called me "Peia," so...

17:11.280 --> 17:12.656
There's something different
about you tonight.

17:13.365 --> 17:16.410
Hey, you should get Kale to come up here,
she'd probably really like it.

17:16.660 --> 17:19.204
I dunno,
she's so obsessed with saving the earth,

17:19.288 --> 17:22.332
I'm kind of afraid of introducing
her to another part of the solar system.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.794
Aw, come on. You should ask her
before its over.

17:33.969 --> 17:38.015
For the last time, I'm telling you,
I do not have a wubby!

17:38.098 --> 17:41.977
Oh, really? Because I happened to find one
in your classroom,

17:42.061 --> 17:45.105
and I put my fart machine in it.

17:45.689 --> 17:46.732
You did?

17:46.940 --> 17:50.319
So, all I have to do is press this button,
and--

17:50.486 --> 17:54.281
[farting noise]

17:54.531 --> 17:55.908
[laughing]

17:55.991 --> 17:57.743
Uh, that was me.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.579
[laughing]

18:01.705 --> 18:02.706
Ah-hah!

18:04.625 --> 18:07.419
Come on, Kale, why won't you come up
to the roof and see the eclipse with me?

18:07.628 --> 18:09.546
Because I'm doing something important.

18:09.630 --> 18:12.257
I'm knitting furry sweaters
for balding coyotes.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.344
Look,
I've been doing stuff that you wanted

18:15.427 --> 18:16.970
to do ever since we started hanging out.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.472
This is something I want to do.

18:18.639 --> 18:22.059
So, you've been pretending
to like the things we do together?

18:22.559 --> 18:23.560
Why?

18:23.811 --> 18:26.814
Well, because if I didn't,
we would have broken up a long time ago.

18:27.064 --> 18:28.065
What?!

18:29.566 --> 18:31.068
Maybe it's time to be honest.

18:31.985 --> 18:32.986
Okay.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.241
Look,
making coyote sweaters seems crazy to me.

18:37.449 --> 18:38.992
Okay, stop being honest.

18:40.869 --> 18:43.956
Maybe you should just find someone
who already likes what you like,

18:44.039 --> 18:45.457
eclipses and stuff.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.044
I think you might be right.

18:49.461 --> 18:53.048
Hey, everybody, it looks like big,
tough Tomika can't sleep

18:53.132 --> 18:54.466
without her baby toy.

18:54.591 --> 18:56.301
[crowd] Ooooh!

18:56.426 --> 18:59.805
-I'm telling you, it's not mine!
-Then whose is it?

19:00.722 --> 19:02.432
It's my wubby!

19:02.558 --> 19:04.017
[gasping]

19:04.184 --> 19:07.187
Wait a minute, if its yours,
then why did Tomika have it?

19:07.312 --> 19:10.399
Because she's my best friend,
and she knew I was missing it.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.109
So she found it for me.

19:12.734 --> 19:16.029
We're not best friends!
But I'll go with the rest of the story.

19:16.780 --> 19:20.951
Mr. Finn sleeps with a baby toy,
he's a baby!

19:21.034 --> 19:25.622
[crowd] He's a baby, he's a baby!
He's a baby!

19:25.706 --> 19:26.832
I'm not a baby!

19:28.917 --> 19:31.879
And you guys can't make fun of me,
I'm a teacher.

19:32.004 --> 19:35.883
-[crowd] Teacher baby! Teacher baby!
-You know what, that's enough!

19:37.009 --> 19:38.343
The wubby is mine!

19:39.803 --> 19:42.222
-Tomika, you don't have to do this.
-Yes, I do.

19:46.393 --> 19:49.229
I've had Pam Lamb
for as long as I can remember.

19:49.521 --> 19:53.150
She's cute, and soft,
and smells like home.

19:53.734 --> 19:54.943
You can laugh at me,

19:55.027 --> 19:58.655
but I've never slept away
from home before, I'm a little scared.

19:59.156 --> 20:01.116
But I bet I'm not the only one.

20:01.408 --> 20:04.077
Am I right? Who's with me?

20:06.788 --> 20:08.373
I sleep with a nightlight!

20:12.711 --> 20:15.214
My dad has to check my closet
for monsters.

20:16.506 --> 20:19.718
That took guts. Who else here is scared?

20:28.310 --> 20:31.396
[sighing]

20:31.647 --> 20:33.232
I'm scared, too.

20:33.315 --> 20:34.608
[gasping]

20:34.775 --> 20:38.987
I know people see me as this super hero,
strutting the hallways in my power sash,

20:40.906 --> 20:44.993
but deep down, I am full of fears.

20:47.996 --> 20:52.709
See, separately, we're all scared,
but together, we're strong.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.963
Maybe I don't need this wubby,
as long as I have you guys.

20:56.380 --> 20:59.216
-Well, if you don't need it, I'll--
-I said "maybe!"

21:09.810 --> 21:10.852
Oh, hey!

21:10.936 --> 21:12.938
Hey, Summer,
I was hoping you'd be up here.

21:13.021 --> 21:15.357
I'm just marveling
at the wonders of the cosmos.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.276
Did you have to go to the bathroom again?

21:17.818 --> 21:19.278
No, I went before I came up here.

21:22.239 --> 21:24.866
I've thought a lot about astronomy,
but tonight,

21:24.950 --> 21:27.244
it's like I'm noticing the sky
for the first time.

21:27.577 --> 21:28.662
You know what I mean?

21:30.414 --> 21:31.790
Think I know exactly what you mean.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.042
Here, you look.

21:36.169 --> 21:39.089
You can see that the moon is
almost completely blocked by the Earth,

21:39.172 --> 21:40.924
making it look like it disappeared.

21:50.267 --> 21:54.187
The red colour comes from the light
passing through Earth's atmosphere.

21:54.354 --> 21:56.398
It's the same reason
that makes it so bright.

21:56.481 --> 21:58.442
Isn't that amazing?

22:02.029 --> 22:07.242
[music playing]
