Yeah. I don't know why, but it's

been happening a lot lately.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.539

04:07.581 --> 04:09.917

04:09.958 --> 04:12.169
They got to come through

here to get to the wash.

04:12.211 --> 04:13.294
We need this fence.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.462
We had two horses wander off.

04:14.504 --> 04:15.964
It took us a week to find them.

04:16.006 --> 04:18.675
Our ranch has used this

04:16.006 --> 04:18.675
trail for over 50 years.

04:18.717 --> 04:19.968
We're not about to stop

Look, just because

04:21.970 --> 04:23.555
it's a dude ranch

04:23.597 --> 04:26.349
doesn't mean I don't bust my ass

04:23.597 --> 04:26.349
the same as you.

(gruffly):

04:37.152 --> 04:39.279
Talk to me.

04:40.781 --> 04:44.785
The lavender soap should be

04:40.781 --> 04:44.785
next to the potpourri.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.370
Well, did you check

04:44.826 --> 04:47.370
with housekeeping?

04:47.412 --> 04:49.831
I'm finally starting

04:47.412 --> 04:49.831
to understand trigonometry.

04:49.873 --> 04:50.791
Yeah?

04:50.832 --> 04:51.917
It's useless.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.585
Come on, you need trigonometry.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.588
Say you want to plot

04:53.627 --> 04:56.588
the orbit of a lunar...

04:56.630 --> 04:59.340
You're right, it's useless.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.593
I've noticed you at school.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.804
You have?

05:03.845 --> 05:07.182
In fact, I've been thinking

05:03.845 --> 05:07.182
about you... a lot.

05:07.224 --> 05:08.725
I heard it, too!

05:08.767 --> 05:10.269
Really?

05:10.310 --> 05:12.854
I know you're super smart,

05:10.310 --> 05:12.854
so here's my question:

05:12.896 --> 05:14.355
with a brain like that,

05:14.397 --> 05:16.357
do you plan, like,

05:14.397 --> 05:16.357
every moment in your life?

05:16.399 --> 05:19.027
No, I don't think...

05:16.399 --> 05:19.027
You do. I know you do.

05:19.069 --> 05:21.280
You always have to know what's

05:19.069 --> 05:21.280
going to happen next, don't you?

05:21.321 --> 05:23.364
Don't you?

05:21.321 --> 05:23.364
No.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.742
I really like not knowing

05:23.406 --> 05:25.742
what's going to happen next.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.535
I mean, even when it's scary.

05:27.577 --> 05:28.829
In fact,

05:28.870 --> 05:31.165
I kind of like it

05:28.870 --> 05:31.165
when it's scary.

05:31.206 --> 05:33.083
You know, like right now,

05:33.125 --> 05:34.293
I don't know

05:34.334 --> 05:36.003
what's going to happen next.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.171
Do you?

05:37.212 --> 05:38.630
Well...

05:38.672 --> 05:40.048
MAN:

05:38.672 --> 05:40.048
You getting anywhere?

05:40.090 --> 05:40.674
What?

05:40.715 --> 05:42.383
The math.

05:42.425 --> 05:45.012
The thing I'm paying you

05:42.425 --> 05:45.012
$6 an hour for.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.387
Oh, yeah, she's really smart.

05:46.429 --> 05:48.556
She didn't get it

05:46.429 --> 05:48.556
when I tried to explain it.

05:48.598 --> 05:51.101
You didn't try to explain it,

05:48.598 --> 05:51.101
you just yelled it at me.

05:51.143 --> 05:52.644
He dropped out of high school,

05:52.686 --> 05:54.938
so whenever anything

05:52.686 --> 05:54.938
makes him feel small, he yells.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.398
I'm sure you could've learned

05:57.440 --> 05:59.193
trigonometry if you wanted to.

05:59.234 --> 06:00.401
When?

06:00.443 --> 06:03.071
When I was in 'Nam,

06:00.443 --> 06:03.071
tied to a Punjab stick,

06:03.113 --> 06:05.490
chin deep in a tiger cage

06:03.113 --> 06:05.490
in the Mekong River?

06:05.532 --> 06:07.617
No, I guess not.

06:07.659 --> 06:10.329
Just remember something,

06:07.659 --> 06:10.329
hotshot.

06:10.369 --> 06:13.414
Me and a lot of my dead comrades

06:10.369 --> 06:13.414
put our asses on the line

06:13.456 --> 06:15.125
so you and your little friends

06:15.167 --> 06:19.338
could have the freedom

06:15.167 --> 06:19.338
to study trigonometry.

06:19.378 --> 06:23.550
Thank you... sir.

06:31.350 --> 06:32.600
That was scary.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.435
Oh, please, he plays that card

06:32.642 --> 06:34.435
all the time.

06:34.477 --> 06:35.645
Last week, he tried to use it

06:35.687 --> 06:37.147
to get a free

06:35.687 --> 06:37.147
Grand Slam at Denny's.

06:37.189 --> 06:38.857
I think we should

06:37.189 --> 06:38.857
get back to math.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.109
Or you could stop stalling

06:38.899 --> 06:41.109
and kiss me.

06:41.151 --> 06:42.861
Kiss you?

06:42.903 --> 06:45.739
Okay, you're obviously crazy.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.739
Your dad's, like, 12 feet away.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.657
Yeah?

06:45.780 --> 06:47.657
You're just trying

06:47.699 --> 06:49.326
to create a situation

06:47.699 --> 06:49.326
where he catches me

06:49.368 --> 06:51.410
and I get my butt kicked.

06:49.368 --> 06:51.410
Well, I'm not...

06:58.960 --> 07:00.461
Hey, morning, Reese.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.461
How's it going?

07:00.503 --> 07:01.922
What are you

07:00.503 --> 07:01.922
doing up?

07:01.963 --> 07:03.464
Well, I was just

07:01.963 --> 07:03.464
lying in bed this morning

07:03.506 --> 07:04.758
staring at the ceiling,

07:03.506 --> 07:04.758
and I thought,

07:04.799 --> 07:06.343
"Why don't I paint

07:04.799 --> 07:06.343
the kitchen cabinets?"

07:06.385 --> 07:07.886
Oh, I made crepes.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.470
Crepes?

07:07.928 --> 07:09.470
Uh-huh.

07:09.512 --> 07:10.680
Come on, sit down.

07:10.722 --> 07:12.766
Look, I've

07:10.722 --> 07:12.766
got strawberries,

07:12.807 --> 07:15.685
bananas, peaches, drawn butter,

07:12.807 --> 07:15.685
maple syrup, you name it.

07:15.727 --> 07:17.354
Dig in.

07:17.396 --> 07:19.398
Hey, honey,

07:17.396 --> 07:19.398
where have you been?

07:19.439 --> 07:21.191
I was up at 4:00 scouring

07:19.439 --> 07:21.191
the grout in the shower

07:21.233 --> 07:23.484
and I thought, "The flower

07:21.233 --> 07:23.484
market is open this early.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.904
Why not drive downtown and

07:23.526 --> 07:25.904
buy us some fresh-cut flowers?"

07:25.946 --> 07:27.948
They're beautiful!

07:25.946 --> 07:27.948
Crepes?

07:27.989 --> 07:29.116
LOIS:

07:27.989 --> 07:29.116
Can't, got to make

07:29.157 --> 07:30.284
the boys' lunches.

07:30.325 --> 07:31.285
I've already made them lunch.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.953
Oh, well, double lunches.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.495
(Hal laughs)

07:34.537 --> 07:36.206
That was so much fun last night.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.499
When I got home, my mom

07:36.248 --> 07:38.499
yelled at me for an hour,

07:38.541 --> 07:39.584
but I didn't care.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.002
I know.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.002
My dad went nuts.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.879
I got two veins

07:41.044 --> 07:42.879
and the temple thing.

07:42.921 --> 07:44.505
(chuckling)

07:44.547 --> 07:47.259
We get it.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.010
You're dating.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.429
Stevie, how's it going?

07:50.470 --> 07:51.512
Good.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.098
Do you know...

07:53.140 --> 07:54.599
How cute you are?

07:53.140 --> 07:54.599
Yes, so what?

07:54.641 --> 07:55.934
Stop bragging about it.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.519
I was...

07:58.561 --> 08:00.105
going to ask...

08:00.147 --> 08:01.815
If I would dump

08:00.147 --> 08:01.815
Malcolm for you.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.524
Well, yeah, but you can't

08:01.856 --> 08:03.524
ask me right in front of him.

08:03.566 --> 08:04.525
He has feelings.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.237
...if you passed...

08:07.279 --> 08:08.529
your trig test...

08:08.571 --> 08:10.324
Oh, yeah, D minus.

08:10.365 --> 08:11.825
Thank you, baby.

08:11.866 --> 08:14.535
All right, I'm sick of school,

08:11.866 --> 08:14.535
let's go to the mall.

08:14.577 --> 08:15.536
Ditch?

08:15.578 --> 08:16.997
Yeah, it's just P.E.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.540
But that's... a class.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.501
And it'll be there

08:19.582 --> 08:21.501
tomorrow. Come on.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.799
Why... pretend?

08:27.841 --> 08:28.883
You're right.

08:32.595 --> 08:36.141
Four times we have

08:32.595 --> 08:36.141
to put up this fence!

08:36.183 --> 08:38.559
Do they think

08:36.183 --> 08:38.559
we are not serious?

08:38.601 --> 08:41.188
Maybe you should talk to them.

08:38.601 --> 08:41.188
Talk to those idiots? No!

08:41.229 --> 08:43.982
Do they think creating wholesome

08:41.229 --> 08:43.982
entertainment for families

08:44.024 --> 08:45.275
is for sissies?

08:45.317 --> 08:46.567
There's arts

08:45.317 --> 08:46.567
and crafts,

08:46.609 --> 08:49.029
there's nature hikes,

08:46.609 --> 08:49.029
there's costume parties.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.613
Let them try to keep track

08:50.655 --> 08:52.866
of what is what

08:50.655 --> 08:52.866
on Opposites Day.

08:52.907 --> 08:53.867
Ooh, they will

08:53.908 --> 08:55.576
pay for this.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.245
GRETCHEN:

08:55.618 --> 08:57.245
Woo-hoo!

08:57.287 --> 08:59.039
Lunchtime.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.581
Oh, Gretchen,

09:00.623 --> 09:04.669
I did not mean

09:00.623 --> 09:04.669
for you to see me in my fury.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.881
Otto, I love

09:04.711 --> 09:07.881
your fury.

09:07.922 --> 09:11.843
Isn't Otto's fury

09:07.922 --> 09:11.843
magnificent, Francis?

09:11.885 --> 09:13.887
I try not to look at his fury.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.596
If they tear this one down,

09:15.638 --> 09:19.184
we will make them suffer

09:15.638 --> 09:19.184
as they have never suffered.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.769
Or, we might consider

09:19.226 --> 09:21.769
trying to reach a compromise.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.855
Do I look French to you? No!

09:23.897 --> 09:28.109
If it is a range war they want,

09:23.897 --> 09:28.109
then by gosh, they will get one.

09:28.151 --> 09:31.154
They do not know

09:28.151 --> 09:31.154
what they are up against.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.533
MAN:

09:32.655 --> 09:34.533
Nice job, son.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.451
Thanks.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.451
Wait a minute.

09:36.493 --> 09:37.994
Why are you giving

09:36.493 --> 09:37.994
him five bucks?

09:38.036 --> 09:39.287
Why?

09:39.329 --> 09:41.039
This young man

09:39.329 --> 09:41.039
cleaned out my gutters,

09:41.081 --> 09:43.500
he sorted my recyclables,

09:41.081 --> 09:43.500
and I didn't even ask him to.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.502
You couldn't find a nicer kid.

09:45.544 --> 09:46.669
I wish I could give him more.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.713
Don't worry about it.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.468
It can't be money day.

09:53.510 --> 09:56.221
There is no money day.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.639
I would know about it

09:56.263 --> 09:58.639
if there was a money day.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.434
Unless...

10:00.475 --> 10:04.145
maybe Mom and Dad don't want

10:00.475 --> 10:04.145
me knowing about money day.

10:05.897 --> 10:07.441
Excuse me.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.276
Beat it, kid, I'm trying

10:07.482 --> 10:09.276
to figure something out.

10:09.317 --> 10:11.069
Okay. Sorry.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.612
I'll just rake around you.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.661
His name is Billy Prescott.

10:20.703 --> 10:21.829
I followed him home.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.498
He lives, like,

10:21.871 --> 10:23.498
a mile away from here.

10:23.540 --> 10:24.749
He looks exactly like you.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.251
You're lying.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.251
Am I?

10:26.293 --> 10:27.668
It's common knowledge, Dewey,

10:27.710 --> 10:29.588
that every person

10:27.710 --> 10:29.588
on this planet has an evil twin.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.172
He's my evil twin?

10:31.214 --> 10:32.132
Fat chance.

10:32.173 --> 10:33.258
The guy's a saint.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.551
You're his evil twin.

10:34.593 --> 10:36.386
But I don't want

10:34.593 --> 10:36.386
to be an evil twin.

10:36.428 --> 10:37.762
I don't make the rules, Dewey.

10:37.804 --> 10:41.141
Besides, we've been given

10:37.804 --> 10:41.141
a golden opportunity here.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.559
To do what?

10:42.601 --> 10:43.684
I don't know yet,

10:43.726 --> 10:45.686
but there's money

10:43.726 --> 10:45.686
and an evil twin.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.981
If we can't figure out

10:45.728 --> 10:47.981
how to make this pay off,

10:48.022 --> 10:51.067
there is something

10:48.022 --> 10:51.067
deeply wrong with us.

10:51.109 --> 10:53.653
Come on, let's go watch

10:51.109 --> 10:53.653
some soap operas.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.702
Things are going great

10:59.742 --> 11:01.702
with Nicki.

11:01.744 --> 11:04.539
We've gone to the planetarium,

11:01.744 --> 11:04.539
miniature golf, the movies...

11:04.581 --> 11:07.584
It's amazing how uncrowded

11:04.581 --> 11:07.584
stuff is during school hours.

11:07.626 --> 11:09.710
You know what? I'd better

11:07.626 --> 11:09.710
get home. I'm grounded.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.546
You're grounded?

11:09.752 --> 11:11.546
Why didn't you tell me?

11:11.588 --> 11:13.965
When my dad found out that

11:11.588 --> 11:13.965
I cut English, he flipped out.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.509
You know what's funny?

11:15.550 --> 11:17.177
He thinks  you're

11:15.550 --> 11:17.177
a bad influence on  me.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.554
That is hilarious.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.554
Listen, Nicki...

11:19.596 --> 11:21.722
He really doesn't like you.

11:19.596 --> 11:21.722
Why? What's wrong with me?

11:21.764 --> 11:23.433
I never did anything to him.

11:23.475 --> 11:25.018
Everybody doesn't

11:23.475 --> 11:25.018
have to like you, Malcolm.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.811
I know, but...

11:25.059 --> 11:26.811
I like you,

11:26.853 --> 11:29.356
and a lot of people

11:26.853 --> 11:29.356
would think that's enough.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.818
Get your

11:33.860 --> 11:36.321
filthy mouth off

11:33.860 --> 11:36.321
of my daughter's face!

11:36.363 --> 11:37.738
Get in the truck.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.658
What are you doing?

11:37.780 --> 11:39.658
You're supposed to be at work!

11:40.158 --> 11:41.742
Okay, hotshot,

11:41.784 --> 11:44.621
consider this

11:41.784 --> 11:44.621
your one and only warning.

11:45.288 --> 11:46.747
You are never, ever

11:46.789 --> 11:49.250
to see my daughter again,

11:46.789 --> 11:49.250
you got that?!

11:49.292 --> 11:50.835
No, Daddy,

11:49.292 --> 11:50.835
take it back!

11:50.877 --> 11:52.420
Take it back!

11:52.462 --> 11:53.838
I cannot believe

11:52.462 --> 11:53.838
that you would come to the park

11:53.880 --> 11:55.756
and you would

11:53.880 --> 11:55.756
do this to me.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.759
Do you know how

11:55.798 --> 11:58.759
embarrassing you are?

11:58.801 --> 12:01.221
I'm okay... I'm okay.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.848
I'm just going to lie down here

12:01.262 --> 12:03.848
for a minute.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.685
(tires screeching,

12:03.890 --> 12:06.685
truck departing)

12:06.725 --> 12:08.645
(whimpering)

12:16.277 --> 12:17.778
HAL:

12:16.277 --> 12:17.778
Hey, honey.

12:17.820 --> 12:18.946
Oh, I had a great day.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.781
You know, I was working

12:18.988 --> 12:20.781
through lunch,

12:20.823 --> 12:22.075
and Mr. Collins came by

12:22.116 --> 12:24.202
and he started asking me

12:22.116 --> 12:24.202
about what I was doing...

12:24.244 --> 12:25.953
I think I'm getting a raise!

12:25.995 --> 12:27.788
Hal, that's wonderful.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.249
I had a good day myself.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.709
After I finished

12:29.290 --> 12:30.709
washing the windows

12:30.749 --> 12:32.293
and stripping the floors,

12:32.335 --> 12:34.212
I went over our tax returns

12:32.335 --> 12:34.212
for the last seven years.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.255
We overpaid in '99.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.047
You're kidding.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.257
$800.

12:37.298 --> 12:38.841
The IRS is sending us a check.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.968
Wow! Honey, great job!

12:41.010 --> 12:44.805
You know, I got

12:41.010 --> 12:44.805
to tell you, I think...

12:44.847 --> 12:46.849
Is that the last one?

12:46.891 --> 12:49.060
Mm-hmm.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.812
So we can...

12:51.854 --> 12:53.481
I guess so.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.858
Great.

12:58.528 --> 12:59.613
Hey.

12:59.654 --> 13:00.863
Stop! I talked to Nicki's father

13:00.905 --> 13:02.449
and he told me what happened.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.618
You are forbidden

13:02.490 --> 13:04.618
from seeing that girl again.

13:04.659 --> 13:05.826
Mom...

13:04.659 --> 13:05.826
Forbidden!

13:05.868 --> 13:07.036
I told him you wouldn't

13:07.078 --> 13:08.288
give him any more trouble,

13:07.078 --> 13:08.288
understood?

13:08.329 --> 13:09.830
Don't worry. The guy's a psycho.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.124
And I think she is, too.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.042
I'm totally

13:11.165 --> 13:13.042
never seeing her again.

13:14.085 --> 13:15.462
Good morning.

13:14.085 --> 13:15.462
Hi.

13:15.503 --> 13:16.837
Last night was great.

13:16.879 --> 13:17.922
Yeah. Okay, I get

13:16.879 --> 13:17.922
home at 3:00 today.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.299
Dad gets home at 6:00.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.841
Now, my little brother

13:19.340 --> 13:20.841
is a total narc,

13:20.883 --> 13:22.843
but we can send him to the

13:20.883 --> 13:22.843
arcade till, like, 4:00.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.345
So we have...

13:22.885 --> 13:24.345
No good.

13:24.387 --> 13:25.888
I've got a chem lab

13:24.387 --> 13:25.888
until, like, 3:30 on Wednesdays.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.223
What about tomorrow?

13:27.265 --> 13:28.433
No good. I can't

13:27.265 --> 13:28.433
wait till tomorrow.

13:28.475 --> 13:29.850
We got to think

13:28.475 --> 13:29.850
of some...

13:29.892 --> 13:30.851
What?

13:30.893 --> 13:31.852
You can't wait till tomorrow?

13:31.894 --> 13:33.647
Shut up.

13:33.688 --> 13:35.482
Okay, we'll do it today

13:33.688 --> 13:35.482
and we'll slide it an hour.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.858
That's cutting it pretty close,

13:35.523 --> 13:37.858
but I'll make it work.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.110
We can make this work.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.654
Dad.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.654
Oh.

13:40.695 --> 13:41.862
See you in math.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.281
Okay.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.865
I might need to see

13:43.323 --> 13:44.865
the nurse first.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.494
DEWEY:

13:44.907 --> 13:47.494
I don't want to do this.

13:47.535 --> 13:48.869
If you don't do it,

13:48.911 --> 13:51.038
I'm going to tell Mom

13:48.911 --> 13:51.038
about you taking all that money.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.873
And you're going

13:51.080 --> 13:52.873
to get a "me" punishment.

13:52.915 --> 13:54.833
Now get to work!

13:59.922 --> 14:01.257
Hey!

14:01.299 --> 14:04.010
What are you doing?!

14:05.928 --> 14:08.598
Yeah, you better run,

14:05.928 --> 14:08.598
Billy Prescott!

14:08.640 --> 14:11.934
All the way

14:08.640 --> 14:11.934
to 1515 Cypress Street,

14:11.976 --> 14:14.395
a block west of Halifax.

14:19.942 --> 14:22.153
HAL:  I'm glad that we decided

14:19.942 --> 14:22.153
not to, uh...

14:22.195 --> 14:24.071
Absolutely.

14:24.113 --> 14:26.073
Every other aspect of our lives

14:24.113 --> 14:26.073
is getting so much attention.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.908
Our lives are

14:26.115 --> 14:27.908
so much better.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.952
Do you think that's how really

14:27.950 --> 14:29.952
successful people just...?

14:29.994 --> 14:32.121
Can't think of any

14:29.994 --> 14:32.121
other explanation.

14:32.163 --> 14:33.414
No. So Bill Gates...?

14:33.456 --> 14:34.915
Probably never.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.752
I started an herb garden

14:34.957 --> 14:37.752
in the backyard today.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.920
Did you know we

14:37.794 --> 14:39.920
had a potting shed?

14:39.962 --> 14:41.172
You're kidding.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.675
Oh, we are definitely

14:41.214 --> 14:43.675
doing the right thing.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.428
I'll go sleep in the car.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.347
Park it a couple

14:47.470 --> 14:49.347
blocks away.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.599
(calypso music playing)

14:52.975 --> 14:54.018
This one is...

14:54.060 --> 14:55.770
Ooh, be careful!

14:54.060 --> 14:55.770
It might bite through!

14:55.812 --> 14:58.356
We have had some good ones

14:55.812 --> 14:58.356
in the past, Francis,

14:58.398 --> 15:02.151
but this may be the

14:58.398 --> 15:02.151
best pirate night ever.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.657
What are you doing?!

15:07.699 --> 15:08.949
Easy, Otto.

15:08.991 --> 15:09.826
What do you think

15:09.868 --> 15:10.951
you are doing?

15:10.993 --> 15:12.161
We have a real

15:10.993 --> 15:12.161
ranch to run,

15:12.203 --> 15:13.872
and our cattle

15:12.203 --> 15:13.872
need water.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.122
We need that fence.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.958
I will not allow you

15:15.164 --> 15:17.958
to kill our horses.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.960
Well, I'm not going to allow

15:18.000 --> 15:19.960
you to kill our cattle!

15:20.002 --> 15:21.170
Enough talk.

15:21.212 --> 15:22.463
Gretchen, my gun!

15:22.505 --> 15:23.548
Which one?

15:23.590 --> 15:24.632
Ooh, what am I saying?

15:24.674 --> 15:26.342
The Luger, hmm?

15:26.384 --> 15:27.802
Otto, this is nuts.

15:27.844 --> 15:31.180
You will see

15:27.844 --> 15:31.180
you are not dealing with a fool.

15:31.222 --> 15:34.601
That fence is going up

15:31.222 --> 15:34.601
twice as high!

15:34.642 --> 15:36.561
We'll just tear it

15:34.642 --> 15:36.561
back down again.

15:36.603 --> 15:40.022
Then we will build another fence

15:36.603 --> 15:40.022
50 feet high!

15:40.064 --> 15:42.817
Every time you build it up,

15:40.064 --> 15:42.817
we'll tear it down.

15:42.859 --> 15:46.613
Every time you tear it down,

15:42.859 --> 15:46.613
we will build it up!

15:46.654 --> 15:49.949
Um, did it ever occur to anyone

15:46.654 --> 15:49.949
to put in a gate?

15:51.826 --> 15:53.077
A gate?

15:53.119 --> 15:54.579
Hmm.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.997
A gate would work.

(movie playing)

16:06.424 --> 16:08.468
Sorry.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.470
I jumped in a line

16:08.509 --> 16:10.470
at the mall to ditch my Dad,

16:10.511 --> 16:12.305
and I ended up giving blood

16:10.511 --> 16:12.305
at the Red Cross.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.641
I told my Mom I was going

16:12.346 --> 16:14.641
to the library tomorrow.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.183
No, we  are  going to the library.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.602
I thought we were going

16:16.225 --> 16:17.602
to the church fair.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.019
No, the church fair is

16:17.644 --> 16:19.019
next week.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.480
It's just a cover

16:19.061 --> 16:20.480
so we can meet at the lake.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.064
I thought the lake was a

16:20.521 --> 16:22.064
cover for the bowling alley.

16:22.106 --> 16:24.024
No, I'm supposed to be

16:22.106 --> 16:24.024
at the bowling alley right now.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.693
This is crazy.

16:25.735 --> 16:27.987
I know. Maybe it'll get crazier.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.116
Oh, my God, my Dad!

16:33.075 --> 16:34.452
BOYD:

16:33.075 --> 16:34.452
You said you were going

16:34.494 --> 16:35.411
to the bowling alley!

16:35.453 --> 16:36.871
NICKI:

16:35.453 --> 16:36.871
I changed my mind!

16:36.913 --> 16:38.080
And why are you

16:36.913 --> 16:38.080
following me?

16:38.122 --> 16:39.540
Don't you trust me?

16:38.122 --> 16:39.540
Shh!

16:39.582 --> 16:41.918
Don't you shush me!

16:41.960 --> 16:43.043
You'll learn to shush

16:43.085 --> 16:45.129
when someone is

16:43.085 --> 16:45.129
shoving bamboo splinters

16:45.171 --> 16:47.047
under your fingernails

16:45.171 --> 16:47.047
trying to get you

16:47.089 --> 16:48.215
to rat out your company!

16:48.257 --> 16:49.342
This is worth it.

16:49.383 --> 16:51.970
This is definitely worth it.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.036
For the love of God.

17:19.288 --> 17:22.082
Man, filling up that guy's car

17:19.288 --> 17:22.082
with cement

17:22.124 --> 17:23.751
was a stroke of genius.

17:23.793 --> 17:25.294
With Billy Prescott

17:23.793 --> 17:25.294
as our fall guy,

17:25.336 --> 17:26.921
we can do anything.

17:26.963 --> 17:29.298
Now, I've updated

17:26.963 --> 17:29.298
my enemies list.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.760
Dewey?

17:32.802 --> 17:35.847
Dewey, I'm

17:32.802 --> 17:35.847
talking to you.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.935
Have you heard enough?

17:40.977 --> 17:42.812
Oh, yeah.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.983
Okay, now I know

17:44.438 --> 17:46.983
what you're thinking.

17:47.025 --> 17:48.317
But the thing that

17:47.025 --> 17:48.317
you don't realize

17:48.359 --> 17:51.195
is that... that I'm

17:48.359 --> 17:51.195
not the real Reese.

17:51.237 --> 17:54.114
I just look like me... him.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.700
But if-if you hurt us...

17:55.742 --> 17:57.117
I-I mean him...

17:58.077 --> 18:00.997
Oh, just go ahead.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.333
(grunting)

18:11.424 --> 18:13.175
Now that I've finished

18:11.424 --> 18:13.175
the carpet,

18:13.217 --> 18:14.802
we can insulate the attic.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.136
I'm telling you, honey,

18:16.178 --> 18:18.180
the value of this house

18:16.178 --> 18:18.180
is going to triple.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.975
We can retire early.

18:21.017 --> 18:22.309
Lois,

18:22.351 --> 18:23.644
what have you planned?

18:23.686 --> 18:25.145
Nothing.

18:25.187 --> 18:28.148
Lois, we made an agreement.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.358
Mm-hmm.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.027
Okay, okay.

18:31.069 --> 18:32.862
You know, two have to play

18:31.069 --> 18:32.862
at this game,

18:32.904 --> 18:34.196
and I'm not playing.

18:34.238 --> 18:37.033
I am just not playing!

18:39.577 --> 18:41.203
So you think

18:39.577 --> 18:41.203
that's going to work?

18:41.245 --> 18:43.664
Well, I've got news for you,

18:41.245 --> 18:43.664
girlie girl.

18:43.706 --> 18:46.626
I am made of sterner stuff.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.962
I happen to like my new life,

18:49.003 --> 18:52.840
and I am not about to descend

18:49.003 --> 18:52.840
to your animal level.

18:52.882 --> 18:55.175
Tool belt on.

18:55.217 --> 18:58.096
(quiet whimper)

18:58.137 --> 19:00.473
I've had it up to here

18:58.137 --> 19:00.473
with your sneaking around.

19:00.514 --> 19:02.683
You're never where you say

19:00.514 --> 19:02.683
you're going to be.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.685
You can't play me

19:02.725 --> 19:04.685
for a fool, Nicki!

19:04.727 --> 19:06.353
Dad, you are

19:04.727 --> 19:06.353
being paranoid!

19:06.395 --> 19:07.855
There is nothing

19:06.395 --> 19:07.855
going on

19:07.897 --> 19:09.899
outside of your stupid,

19:07.897 --> 19:09.899
little twisted head.

19:09.941 --> 19:11.484
Well, if I find out

19:09.941 --> 19:11.484
you've been lying,

19:11.525 --> 19:14.153
there's going to be hell to pay.

19:19.241 --> 19:22.202
Oh, are you okay?

19:22.244 --> 19:23.871
I've lost all the feeling

19:22.244 --> 19:23.871
in my arms,

19:23.913 --> 19:25.081
but it's distracting me

19:25.123 --> 19:26.499
from the searing pain

19:25.123 --> 19:26.499
in my shoulders.

19:26.540 --> 19:30.044
Poor baby.

19:30.086 --> 19:33.589
Listen, Nicki, I'm not sure

19:30.086 --> 19:33.589
this is going to work.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.133
What do you mean?

19:35.174 --> 19:36.592
We do all of this stuff,

19:36.634 --> 19:39.219
sneaking around and making all

19:36.634 --> 19:39.219
these complicated plans,

19:39.261 --> 19:40.513
and it feels incredible.

19:40.554 --> 19:43.099
I have never felt anything

19:40.554 --> 19:43.099
so intense in my life,

19:43.141 --> 19:44.224
but, I mean, is that it?

19:44.266 --> 19:45.893
What are you saying?

19:45.935 --> 19:48.395
We never do any normal

19:45.935 --> 19:48.395
boyfriend/girlfriend stuff.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.272
I don't know

19:48.437 --> 19:50.272
anything about you,

19:50.314 --> 19:52.232
except that you really

19:50.314 --> 19:52.232
get off on danger.

19:52.274 --> 19:54.234
And apparently, I do, too.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.278
I'm just not sure that's enough.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.072
(scoffs)

19:58.114 --> 19:59.532
I think you

19:58.114 --> 19:59.532
just insulted me.

19:59.573 --> 20:01.826
No. I...

19:59.573 --> 20:01.826
Yes, you did!

20:01.868 --> 20:03.452
Maybe you don't know

20:01.868 --> 20:03.452
anything about me,

20:03.494 --> 20:05.955
but I actually bothered

20:03.494 --> 20:05.955
to learn things about you.

20:05.997 --> 20:07.456
I don't like you

20:07.498 --> 20:09.249
because I'm some

20:07.498 --> 20:09.249
creepy danger junkie.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.502
I like you because you're

20:09.291 --> 20:11.502
funny, and you're kind,

20:11.544 --> 20:13.337
and you don't let me

20:11.544 --> 20:13.337
get away with stuff.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.422
And even when you

20:13.379 --> 20:15.422
complain, you're funny,

20:15.464 --> 20:17.257
and I never have to think

20:15.464 --> 20:17.257
about what I'm going

20:17.299 --> 20:19.343
to say because it

20:17.299 --> 20:19.343
just comes out.

20:19.385 --> 20:22.138
And it-it feels right,

20:19.385 --> 20:22.138
and I feel safe.

20:22.180 --> 20:23.681
Well, wait.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.725
I like you because

20:23.723 --> 20:25.725
you're really fun and honest.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.267
And I don't feel

20:27.309 --> 20:29.145
like I'm being tricked

20:27.309 --> 20:29.145
when you're nice to me.

20:29.187 --> 20:30.479
You're amazing with my friends.

20:30.521 --> 20:32.690
You're amazing.

20:34.316 --> 20:38.196
Okay, so this is real.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.781
It's not just the danger

20:38.237 --> 20:40.781
or whatever.

20:40.823 --> 20:41.949
This is real.

20:41.991 --> 20:43.242
Duh.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.495
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.455
I love you.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.290
Night, Daddy.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.468
HAL:

20:59.341 --> 21:01.468
Oh, no.

21:01.510 --> 21:02.678
I'm late.

21:02.720 --> 21:03.763
Oh, me, too.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.223
Wait, there

21:03.804 --> 21:05.223
was something

21:05.264 --> 21:06.306
I was supposed to

21:05.264 --> 21:06.306
do at work today.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.308
Come home for lunch?

21:08.350 --> 21:09.351
That's it.

21:09.393 --> 21:10.561
(moaning)

21:10.603 --> 21:11.812
Got to go.

21:11.854 --> 21:13.189
Bye.
