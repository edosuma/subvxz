Oh!

01:12.739 --> 01:13.573
[gasps]

01:13.656 --> 01:15.283
[Brooklynn] Okay, so…

01:15.366 --> 01:16.785
[pensive music]

01:18.536 --> 01:20.538
…definitely not Costa Rica.

01:25.210 --> 01:28.338
[Darius] It looks more like… Australia?

01:28.922 --> 01:31.549
No way we went that far, though. Right?

01:32.801 --> 01:34.636
Kenji, what are you doing?

01:34.719 --> 01:36.054
Making sure we're not dead.

01:36.137 --> 01:37.847
'Cause if we're dead, we'd be ghosts,

01:37.931 --> 01:41.017
and if we're ghosts, I'd be able
to, like… Ooh, go through you.

01:41.100 --> 01:45.188
-We're not dead!
-Well, now you know. You're welcome.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.607
[Brooklynn] So, we know where we aren't.

01:48.149 --> 01:50.109
Any idea where we are?

01:50.193 --> 01:54.989
[Yaz] Nope. Just that we're stranded.
And alone. Again.

01:55.073 --> 01:57.700
[Darius] We just gotta assess
the situation.

01:59.536 --> 02:00.870
Hey, hey, guys! Look at that!

02:02.580 --> 02:05.041
Over there in the distance.
Something shiny!

02:06.751 --> 02:12.549
[Sammy] I see it! Looks like the sun
is glinting off some sort of metal thingy?

02:12.632 --> 02:15.009
Something metal could mean
someone had to make it.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.511
We gotta go check it out.

02:16.594 --> 02:20.056
Hang on. You wanna go walking
across a blazing hot desert

02:20.140 --> 02:21.933
just because you saw something shiny?

02:22.016 --> 02:23.935
We have no idea what's out there.

02:24.018 --> 02:26.688
Oh, my sweet frightened children.

02:26.771 --> 02:31.609
So, we're not in "Costa Rica".
And we don't know "where we are".

02:31.693 --> 02:34.154
And we have "no hope".

02:34.779 --> 02:38.533
We didn't know how we were gonna survive
on Nublar and yet, we did.

02:38.616 --> 02:42.036
By sheer will,
determination, and teamwork.

02:42.120 --> 02:46.708
There aren't even dinosaurs here!
So logically, this should be easier.

02:46.791 --> 02:51.421
So, let's go out there
and, you know, survive!

02:53.256 --> 02:54.591
[sighs]
Why not?

02:54.674 --> 02:56.134
We can at least try.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.056
Good speech, Ben.

[foreboding music]

03:12.108 --> 03:14.027
[screeching]

03:19.282 --> 03:22.619
This place is weird.
It's like another planet or something.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.996
Oh, maybe we were abducted by aliens.

03:25.079 --> 03:27.999
[laughs]
Because that makes perfect sense.

03:28.082 --> 03:30.209
[chuckles]
No, that… that…

03:30.293 --> 03:34.130
No, that'd be dumb. It's dumb.
Never mind. What? No, you shut up.

03:35.089 --> 03:36.883
'Cause dinosaurs weren't enough,

03:36.966 --> 03:39.093
now we're washed up
on some deserted island.

03:39.177 --> 03:43.014
Well, at least it's a nice day?

03:43.973 --> 03:47.477
At least, there aren't
any mosquitoes here.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.394
[scoffs]

03:48.478 --> 03:52.774
Yeah. At least, we're not being tortured
for eternity by vampires!

03:52.857 --> 03:57.237
Oh, I got one! At least,
it's like the beach but with no ocean.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.907
-[Sammy] Oh, that's a good one!
-[Yaz] Eh! Needs more vampires.

04:06.955 --> 04:12.710
At least we aren't being tortured
by demons in a fiery pit of fire.

04:13.211 --> 04:14.963
Are you sure about that?

04:18.466 --> 04:19.300

04:51.291 --> 04:53.376
-[Brooklynn] A sandstorm?
-[Sammy] What do we do?

04:53.459 --> 04:54.711
[Darius] We need to find cover!

04:54.794 --> 04:58.798
We always outran those pesky storms
on Nublar! Run!

04:58.881 --> 05:00.758

05:48.264 --> 05:50.975

-Hello!

06:19.170 --> 06:21.214
[Kenji] Ben? Sammy?

06:22.381 --> 06:26.219
Brooklynn? Kenji? Where are you guys?

06:26.302 --> 06:29.972
-Brooklynn!

[all grunting]

06:57.375 --> 06:58.251
Thanks.

07:00.294 --> 07:01.754
It's her jacket!

07:03.172 --> 07:04.924
She must be around here somewhere.

07:06.342 --> 07:08.094
Now, all we gotta do is…

07:12.098 --> 07:13.182
find them.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.478
-Yo!
-Guys?

07:18.020 --> 07:20.273
Sammy? Hello!

07:20.773 --> 07:24.193
Sammy? Yaz? Anybody?

07:25.778 --> 07:27.238
Guys, where are you?

07:28.156 --> 07:29.157
Help!

07:31.367 --> 07:33.035
-Ow!
-Are you okay?

07:33.119 --> 07:34.120
[groans]
It's nothing.

07:34.203 --> 07:35.413
Let me see.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.463
Okay… all better!

07:45.381 --> 07:47.550
Whatevs, tough guy.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.347
What is this place?

07:59.937 --> 08:03.774
-[Brooklynn] Kenji.
-Uh, uh, hey, hey. Um, 'sup?

08:03.858 --> 08:07.612
Do you hear that? That sound. What is it?

08:09.155 --> 08:13.117
Is that water pipes?
That doesn't make any sense.

08:13.201 --> 08:15.453
-How could there be water pipes in here?
-[gasps]

08:18.247 --> 08:19.874
Where's the water going?

08:19.957 --> 08:23.544
Don't know.
But maybe they lead to a way out?

08:23.628 --> 08:24.670
[Brooklynn] This way.

08:25.338 --> 08:29.425
Sure, why not? I mean, you are the smart…

08:29.509 --> 08:32.136
[Brooklynn laughs]
The… "The smart"?

08:32.220 --> 08:35.389
One. The smart one.

[nervous chuckle]

08:38.142 --> 08:39.393
[Brooklynn laughs]

08:39.977 --> 08:43.397
Man, I wish anyone else was down here
with us to hear you say that.

08:43.481 --> 08:46.400
[nervous chuckling]

08:49.737 --> 08:54.158
Brooklynn? Kenji? Where are you guys?

08:57.870 --> 09:01.290
I hate to say it, but maybe
we should stop for the night?

09:01.374 --> 09:03.334
No, we have to keep going!

09:03.417 --> 09:05.628
We might find an opening into the canyon
if we look for--

09:05.711 --> 09:07.046
There's no time for that!

09:08.214 --> 09:10.841
Look, the ground slopes down a ways ahead.

09:10.925 --> 09:14.220
[Darius] Let's see if we can get around
and find another way in there.

09:25.356 --> 09:28.317
-[both gasp]
-Oh, sorry. I was just, just, um…

09:28.401 --> 09:31.529
Look, there! I bet that's a way out!

09:31.612 --> 09:33.197
[grunts]

09:35.616 --> 09:37.785
Kenji! Come up here and give me a boost.

09:41.581 --> 09:42.456
Kenji?

09:42.540 --> 09:43.666
Hmm?

09:43.749 --> 09:45.001
Are you okay?

09:45.585 --> 09:48.004
Hmm? Yeah. Yes.

09:53.050 --> 09:54.385
-Kenji!
-Yeah?

10:04.437 --> 10:07.356
[groans]
I'm okay.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.818
There. That wasn't so hard, was it?

10:11.485 --> 10:14.280
Well, I do make everything look easy.

10:14.363 --> 10:16.365
[chuckles]
Come on.

10:20.578 --> 10:21.704
[panting]

10:22.288 --> 10:23.998
No, no!
[grunts]

10:27.585 --> 10:28.419
[groans]

10:31.714 --> 10:36.927
-[Ben] It's all my fault.
-Hey. Um, at least…

10:41.766 --> 10:44.518
-That's the best "at least" you can do?
-Lame.

10:44.602 --> 10:45.603
-Kenji!
-Brooklynn!

10:45.686 --> 10:47.229
-You guys!
-[laughter]

10:48.064 --> 10:52.943
Yep! Strongman Kenji pushed
an entire boulder out of the way.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.696
[chuckles]
It was nothing. Not a big deal.

10:55.780 --> 10:59.200
Wait, Kenji's not taking credit
for something cool he did?

10:59.283 --> 11:02.161
And… we've got more good news!

11:05.289 --> 11:06.499
Ta-da!

11:08.250 --> 11:09.293
-[all gasp]

11:12.963 --> 11:15.007
I've never been so thirsty
in my whole life!

11:15.549 --> 11:18.969
The weird thing is we heard
water pipes in the caverns.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.346
Somebody built this.

11:20.930 --> 11:24.475
-But why?
-And where are they now?

11:24.975 --> 11:27.645
No idea, but if we can find
that shiny thing,

11:27.728 --> 11:29.271
maybe we'll get some answers.

11:31.941 --> 11:34.693
Hey! Hey, guys, check it out.

11:34.777 --> 11:38.656
These are just like the berry bushes
on Nublar. Same leaves and everything!

11:38.739 --> 11:41.909
Water and food? What is it, our birthdays?

11:41.992 --> 11:44.370
-I know, right?
-[moaning]

-[panicked whimper]
-Ow!

12:04.223 --> 12:07.309
What if I only think
they're like the ones on Nublar,

12:07.393 --> 12:09.103
but they're really poisonous?

12:09.186 --> 12:10.604
[gags]

12:11.480 --> 12:12.898
What if I'm wrong?

12:18.654 --> 12:19.864
Okay, okay.

12:20.364 --> 12:22.867
Everything will be fine,
once we find that shiny thing.

12:23.451 --> 12:26.287
Okay, it can't be too far now.

12:26.787 --> 12:29.331
Let's try to find it
before the sun goes down.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.876
Great. That gives us about ten seconds.

12:33.210 --> 12:35.212
[foreboding music]

12:35.296 --> 12:37.298
Come on, guys. We gotta move!

[all panting]

12:49.852 --> 12:52.313
[all breathing heavily]

12:56.400 --> 13:00.070
A metal rectangle? That's all it was?

13:00.696 --> 13:02.156
Maybe there's more!

13:08.704 --> 13:09.705
[gasps]

13:10.206 --> 13:13.792
There's also these, um… animal bones?

13:15.794 --> 13:18.506
Whatever it was
could have died of natural causes.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.259
Yeah. Not a huge plus.

13:22.343 --> 13:26.013
No people. No help.

13:26.764 --> 13:30.392
Just… questions.

-I heard a noise.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.481
Are you sure, Ben?

15:41.023 --> 15:44.193
Maybe this is like yesterday,
with the berries.

[growls]

16:12.012 --> 16:15.015
-I told you we time-traveled.
-[Yaz] Shut up, Kenji.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.768
[snarls]

16:17.851 --> 16:19.853
What do we do? What do we do?
What do we do?

16:22.564 --> 16:25.484
-Hey! Toothy! This way!
-No, Ben, no!

16:25.567 --> 16:26.527
No!

Uh… uh…

[Kenji] Ben, get out of here!

-Run, run, run, run!
-Oh, yeah.

18:32.027 --> 18:33.237
[roars]

18:33.320 --> 18:34.238
Now what?

18:34.321 --> 18:37.574
I didn't have a plan beyond getting past
the teeth end of that thing!

18:38.617 --> 18:39.785
[roars]

18:43.080 --> 18:46.208
Almost. Now!

Over here!

-Yeah!
-All right!

19:23.162 --> 19:24.413
[laughter]

19:33.046 --> 19:36.091
Oh! You idiots! What were you thinking?

19:36.175 --> 19:40.179
"Thinking"? That didn't play
a huge part in it.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.180
[laughter]

19:49.146 --> 19:52.858
-Ben, what's wrong?
-It's just that…

19:53.609 --> 19:56.403
I worked so hard
to not be "scared Ben" anymore.

19:56.486 --> 19:58.947
But the minute we leave Nublar,
I'm right back to square one.

19:59.031 --> 20:02.117
Freaking out with the berries.
Freaking out about the tiger.

20:02.201 --> 20:06.955
Which is the reason we're all alive
right now. If you didn't warn us…

20:08.040 --> 20:10.959
Yeah, well, at least "scared Ben"
is good for something.

20:11.043 --> 20:15.881
Hey! Pity party of one,
you also jumped into a cave with a tiger

20:15.964 --> 20:17.758
to get it to stop chasing your friends.

20:17.841 --> 20:21.094
[chuckles]
Saber-toothed tiger! Pretty sick, dude.

20:22.262 --> 20:27.100
You may not be fearless-island-Ben,
but you're not scared-camp-Ben either.

20:27.684 --> 20:31.647
[Darius] Maybe now,
you're finally just… Ben.

20:33.315 --> 20:34.316
[laughs]

20:34.399 --> 20:38.737
-That does have a nice ring to it.
-And I'm just Kenji… the brave.

20:38.820 --> 20:42.324
I guess that just makes me
Brooklynn, the smart.

20:45.953 --> 20:46.995
Right, Kenj?

20:50.624 --> 20:52.793
[all laugh]

20:53.377 --> 20:55.128
So, what now?

20:55.629 --> 20:58.215
Now, we do the only thing we can do.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.133
Keep going.

21:00.217 --> 21:03.053
And look out for saber-toothed tigers,
freak sandstorms,

21:03.136 --> 21:06.473
and whatever the heck else
this place has in store for us.

21:07.057 --> 21:09.351
At least, we have each other.

21:09.851 --> 21:12.145
That's the best "at least" yet.

21:15.899 --> 21:17.901
[screeching]

21:19.569 --> 21:20.487
[groans]

21:20.570 --> 21:24.074
-It's too quiet.
-We're hot, thirsty,

21:24.157 --> 21:25.867
in the middle of nowhere,

21:25.951 --> 21:30.539
and maybe surrounded by who knows what,
but that's your complaint?

21:30.622 --> 21:34.960
Yeah. Because at least
we can do something about it.

21:35.043 --> 21:38.255
[babbling]

21:42.092 --> 21:43.552
[thuds, yelps]

21:44.970 --> 21:46.555
Oh, what the…

21:48.515 --> 21:49.516
[Yaz] What is that?

22:04.948 --> 22:06.616
[thuds, groans]

22:06.700 --> 22:08.285
Kenji, you okay?

22:08.368 --> 22:09.703
