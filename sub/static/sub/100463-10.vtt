WEBVTT

00:37.704 --> 00:39.372
<i>I want you to finish your food.</i>

00:40.165 --> 00:43.043
We're not eating again until dinnertime.

00:47.547 --> 00:50.258
-You tossed and turned all night.
- Yeah?

00:50.341 --> 00:51.843
Anything going on at work?

00:53.845 --> 00:55.055
Nothing new.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.892
Everything's back to normal.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.980
Normal's good. Right?

01:06.149 --> 01:07.233
Yes.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.862
Everything's good. Very good.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.078
Drink your milk too.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.863
What happened, man?
You forget how to pack?

01:54.447 --> 01:55.490
Clean this up.

01:56.407 --> 01:58.451
-Put this stuff in those boxes.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.954
-What happened?
- Offside.

02:01.412 --> 02:03.081
Yo, we're out of beer.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.374
Yeah, all right. I'll go.

02:05.458 --> 02:08.253
Pack this up and put it over there.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.926
-What's the score?
- Still one-zero.

02:15.009 --> 02:16.553
Those assholes don't know how to play.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.972
Aponte can't defend worth a shit
since last season.

02:20.348 --> 02:21.808
Gonna get the beers, be right back.

02:21.891 --> 02:23.560
Zarco, keep an eye on those clowns.

02:23.643 --> 02:26.354
Hey! Really need the bazooka, Rambo?

02:33.236 --> 02:34.237
Funny guy.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.405
Just go.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.703
Cross it, asshole!

02:58.094 --> 03:02.098
<i>Sell-out crowd</i>
<i>here on a beautiful, sunshiny day.</i>

03:03.391 --> 03:07.103
<i>Two and two is the count.</i>
<i>We're up to six pitches in this at-bat.</i>

03:07.645 --> 03:11.274
<i>It is Fan Appreciation Day</i>
<i>here at the ballpark.</i>

03:11.357 --> 03:13.026
<i>Last day of the regular season.</i>

03:13.943 --> 03:15.320
<i>The two-two pitch.</i>

03:16.112 --> 03:19.240
<i>Breaking ball. Swung on.</i>
<i>Hits it off his foot.</i>

03:19.324 --> 03:20.909
That's $3.99.

03:20.992 --> 03:22.785
<i>And the count remains two and two.</i>

03:22.869 --> 03:24.704
- Um...

03:26.039 --> 03:28.833
So, <i>this game of cat and mouse continues.</i>

03:28.917 --> 03:32.212
<i>The crowd really wants a strikeout here,</i>

03:32.295 --> 03:35.757
<i>in a tight game in the top of the sixth.</i>

03:35.840 --> 03:37.300
<i>Looks in and delivers.</i>

03:37.383 --> 03:38.593
What's the score?

03:38.676 --> 03:39.802
<i>Popped him up.</i>

03:39.886 --> 03:41.554
Still one-nothing.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.014
Come on, Dodgers.

03:43.097 --> 03:45.516
<i>He's got enough room,</i>
<i>and he corrals it...</i>

03:45.600 --> 03:47.101
Thank you, miss.

03:47.685 --> 03:51.356
<i>So one not-very-quick out</i>
<i>with a nine-pitch at bat</i>

03:51.439 --> 03:52.774
<i>here in the top of the sixth.</i>

03:52.857 --> 03:55.360
<i>And that'll bring up the second baseman</i>
<i>who's one for three...</i>

04:11.751 --> 04:12.961
Son of a bitch...

04:13.044 --> 04:14.504
Go, go, go, go!

04:14.587 --> 04:15.838
Get back! Get back!

05:56.105 --> 05:58.274
<i>Thank you for seeing me, sir.</i>

05:58.941 --> 06:00.318
Like this, in your home.

06:00.401 --> 06:04.822
Azul tells me things in Sinaloa
are going well.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.451
It's coming along, coming along.

06:09.243 --> 06:10.328
Handling business, sir.

06:10.411 --> 06:12.205
Good to hear.

06:12.789 --> 06:13.915
I wanted...

06:14.874 --> 06:17.126
I wanted to talk to you
about Héctor Palma.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.629
Said you'd think about
letting him back in,

06:19.712 --> 06:21.547
-giving him a pass.
-Yeah.

06:22.423 --> 06:23.716
Thing is,

06:24.592 --> 06:27.220
Palma tried to pull out of the Federation.

06:27.303 --> 06:30.056
-He fucked up. I know that.
- No, Chapo.

06:30.139 --> 06:31.474
He didn't fuck up.

06:31.557 --> 06:32.892
He betrayed all of us.

06:34.018 --> 06:36.104
It was just talk. He never did anything.

06:36.187 --> 06:38.689
-Because I stopped him.
- He was messed up in the head.

06:38.773 --> 06:41.442
The Cochi thing, it hit him hard,
just like everyone else.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.120
Heard anything about Palma?

06:52.203 --> 06:53.079
Hmm?

06:53.162 --> 06:54.455
You've spoken to him, Chapo?

06:55.164 --> 06:57.625
No, not since he ran.
Haven't heard a thing.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.127
Hmm.

06:59.210 --> 07:00.420
Güero is a good man.

07:00.503 --> 07:01.754
A good worker.

07:02.338 --> 07:05.049
They like him in Sinaloa.
He can help grow the plaza.

07:05.633 --> 07:06.843
Make money for everyone.

07:08.886 --> 07:12.390
The bosses, they're... cool with it.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.518
What do you mean?

07:15.601 --> 07:16.894
We spoke about it, all of us.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.314
Palma's coming back. And they approve.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.028
You're a good friend.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.197
Loyal.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.033
All right, Chapo.

07:31.909 --> 07:33.578
I'll let you know.

07:33.661 --> 07:34.829
Thanks for coming.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.459
Thank you for your time.

07:42.753 --> 07:44.172
Take care, Chapo.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.137
What?

07:51.554 --> 07:53.639
Bosses are taking votes now?

07:53.723 --> 07:56.976
Palma's popular. Respected.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.230
Clemency could be smart.

08:01.939 --> 08:04.025
After all the shit we've been through...

08:06.944 --> 08:09.155
What have you heard about Palma?
Where is he?

08:09.238 --> 08:11.657
We know the family's holed up in Acapulco.

08:11.741 --> 08:15.119
His wife used a credit card
to pay for a motel.

08:16.412 --> 08:19.165
Have guys keeping an eye on it,
but Palma hasn't showed.

08:20.041 --> 08:23.461
Once money starts coming in
from the Juárez shipment,

08:24.128 --> 08:27.131
if Héctor Palma is ready
to ask for forgiveness,

08:27.215 --> 08:29.550
a pardon makes sense.

08:43.022 --> 08:45.191
<i>We interrupt</i>
<i>this program with breaking news</i>

08:45.274 --> 08:47.068
<i>coming out of Sylmar, California.</i>

08:47.568 --> 08:49.695
<i>From New York City with a special report.</i>

08:50.279 --> 08:51.989
<i>Federal agents in California...</i>

08:52.073 --> 08:54.367
Hey, Morris, it's coming on now.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.744
You hear about this thing, Breslin?

08:57.954 --> 08:59.372
Some shit went down in L.A.

08:59.455 --> 09:01.624
<i>...to this country</i>
<i>by the drug criminals,</i>

09:01.707 --> 09:04.544
<i>the untold tons</i>
<i>that are still getting through</i>

09:04.627 --> 09:07.588
<i>to the streets and brains of Americans,</i>
<i>especially the young,</i>

09:07.672 --> 09:10.758
<i>and how hard it's going to be</i>
<i>to turn that around.</i>

09:10.841 --> 09:12.218
<i>David Dow reports.</i>

09:13.219 --> 09:16.472
<i>Authorities say a citizen's tip</i>
<i>led them to the warehouse</i>

09:16.556 --> 09:18.349
<i>in a North Los Angeles suburb,</i>

09:18.432 --> 09:21.435
<i>where they made</i>
<i>the largest cocaine seizure in history.</i>

09:21.519 --> 09:24.897
<i>At least 20 tons, with a street value</i>
<i>that could range as high...</i>

09:24.981 --> 09:27.441
That doesn't make fucking sense.

09:27.525 --> 09:30.319
<i>It gave me cold chills</i>
<i>when I walked in and looked at it,</i>

09:30.403 --> 09:33.656
<i>and the magnitude of it</i>
<i>has really not sunk into me yet.</i>

09:33.739 --> 09:34.824
<i>It's enormous. Uh...</i>

09:34.907 --> 09:37.493
<i>It's gonna bring tears</i>
<i>to a lot of people's eyes tonight</i>

09:37.577 --> 09:39.161
<i>because it's not gonna be on the street.</i>

09:39.870 --> 09:42.582
<i>Up to that morning in 1989,</i>

09:42.665 --> 09:45.918
<i>the biggest cocaine bust</i>
<i>in American history was four tons,</i>

09:46.419 --> 09:48.087
<i>grabbed in Fort Lauderdale.</i>

09:49.088 --> 09:50.798
<i>But the world heavyweight title holder?</i>

09:51.757 --> 09:55.886
<i>That was the 11 tons pulled out</i>
<i>of the Colombian jungle in Tranquilandia.</i>

09:56.387 --> 09:57.888
<i>That shit was legendary.</i>

09:59.640 --> 10:01.809
<i>You added both those busts</i>
<i>together, though,</i>

10:02.476 --> 10:04.979
<i>still wouldn't touch the haul</i>
<i>from that warehouse.</i>

10:05.062 --> 10:06.981
<i>Sylmar blew them away.</i>

10:07.607 --> 10:09.442
<i>And it wasn't fucking close.</i>

10:09.525 --> 10:11.277
<i>North of 20 tons.</i>

10:11.861 --> 10:14.447
<i>Worth $7 billion, easy.</i>

10:14.530 --> 10:18.326
<i>No one had ever seen that much cocaine</i>
<i>in one place.</i>

10:18.409 --> 10:22.038
<i>Oh, and there was</i>
<i>over $12 million in cash on hand.</i>

10:22.622 --> 10:24.415
<i>Pizza money, I guess.</i>

10:24.498 --> 10:27.585
<i>And all of it, the entire place,</i>

10:27.668 --> 10:30.254
<i>was secured with a six-dollar padlock.</i>

10:34.342 --> 10:35.676
Fuck.

10:37.970 --> 10:40.640
<i>It was</i>
<i>the kind of bust that makes careers.</i>

10:42.767 --> 10:44.018
<i>Or ends them.</i>

10:45.353 --> 10:47.480
<i>We've been short on cash for months.</i>

10:48.564 --> 10:51.442
And the fucking Colombians
who were finally going to pay us

10:51.525 --> 10:53.861
just lost billions of dollars.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.489
How are the Colombians
gonna pay us now, eh?

10:57.323 --> 10:58.282
I'm not sure.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.700
"I'm not sure."

10:59.784 --> 11:01.160
But they're going to pay us.

11:01.243 --> 11:02.828
They have to. Right?

11:03.412 --> 11:07.249
With what? They just lost more coke
than anyone's ever seen.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.628
-They better fucking give us our money.
-Or what? What can we do?

11:10.711 --> 11:11.879
I'll fuck them up, bro.

11:11.962 --> 11:14.131
Really, Ramón? How?

11:15.549 --> 11:17.802
I'll get a fucking army, all killers, man.

11:17.885 --> 11:19.387
With what money?

11:19.470 --> 11:23.683
You gonna walk up to the Colombians
and ask them for a loan?

11:23.766 --> 11:25.101
Hey, hey.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.728
Or have them buy you
fucking guns? Don't be stupid.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.730
Things are gonna get ugly, man.

11:29.814 --> 11:33.359
- We don't need a damn army.
- That's what I just said!

11:33.442 --> 11:34.402
Yeah.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.053
Hello.

12:04.974 --> 12:07.226
Of course, it'd be my pleasure.

12:07.935 --> 12:10.688
Come to Guadalajara, I'll see you here.
Much safer.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.339
It's okay. Stay with the car.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.751
Would you like a drink, sir?

13:14.543 --> 13:16.295
Strawberry daiquiri.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.804
I preferred Panama.

13:25.679 --> 13:27.723
But Guadalajara, it's okay.

13:29.266 --> 13:33.229
Look at you, still walking around.

13:34.104 --> 13:36.232
You must have forgiving partners.

13:37.691 --> 13:39.360
It was unfortunate.

13:40.444 --> 13:42.404
But ultimately...

13:43.531 --> 13:45.199
insignificant.

13:45.282 --> 13:46.659
Really?

13:46.742 --> 13:48.035
Insignificant?

13:49.787 --> 13:50.746
Listen to yourself.

13:51.372 --> 13:54.875
Seven billion dollars’ worth of cocaine,
lost on your watch.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.127
That's insignificant?

13:59.129 --> 14:02.633
We Colombians can always make
more cocaine, Miguel Ángel.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.469
On top of that, there's my fee.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.763
Two hundred and ten million dollars.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.306
That's a lot of money.

14:09.390 --> 14:10.724
Well, as I once said,

14:11.308 --> 14:12.893
cocaine is fast.

14:13.644 --> 14:15.396
Money is slow.

14:18.232 --> 14:21.402
Perhaps we can do something about that
this time.

14:22.903 --> 14:25.114
My partners and I
want to make you a proposal.

14:25.906 --> 14:28.367
One that we believe you will like.

14:29.076 --> 14:29.994
Let's hear it.

14:31.537 --> 14:34.164
We are prepared to offer you
$4,000 a kilo.

14:35.082 --> 14:36.750
Half up-front.

14:37.793 --> 14:39.461
The other half upon delivery.

14:39.545 --> 14:42.798
That's $280 million to your organization.

14:45.175 --> 14:48.053
Yeah, you grow the leaf.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.680
You process it.

14:49.763 --> 14:52.266
And maybe you can make enough of it

14:52.933 --> 14:54.643
to replace what you lost

14:54.727 --> 14:57.521
and keep you from being buried by Escobar.

15:00.316 --> 15:01.150
But...

15:01.734 --> 15:03.444
I know something else, Pacho.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.197
I'm the only person that can move it.

15:08.032 --> 15:10.159
That's if you want to cross it
through Mexico.

15:13.579 --> 15:14.663
Miguel Ángel...

15:16.457 --> 15:18.167
we did great things together.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.753
Seventy tons.

15:20.836 --> 15:22.338
"We"?

15:23.505 --> 15:26.592
Sorry, but you're wrong, Pacho.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.136
What you tried to do...

15:29.970 --> 15:31.555
was fuck me over.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.142
Right? But you weren't able to.

15:37.102 --> 15:40.356
And now, here you are with your fucking
hat in your hand asking for a favor.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.360
Because you are drowning.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.863
You should understand...

15:48.572 --> 15:50.991
I'm a very resentful person.

15:53.994 --> 15:55.871
And I prefer to let you drown.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.294
I've heard things about you, Félix.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.089
Things you've done,

16:05.756 --> 16:07.675
how you do business.

16:12.846 --> 16:18.227
It's a funny thing, this Sylmar thing
happening when it did.

16:20.604 --> 16:23.399
If you want me to handle your product,

16:24.149 --> 16:25.401
hmm,

16:25.484 --> 16:26.944
then I'll get paid differently.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.365
Pay attention.

16:31.448 --> 16:32.449
Hmm?

16:33.450 --> 16:35.285
I keep half the loads

16:35.369 --> 16:38.247
that come through here.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.752
Kilo for kilo.

16:48.215 --> 16:51.760
If this doesn't work for you,
go through Canada.

16:52.678 --> 16:55.931
It's only 3,000 miles that way.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.895
You getting into sales?

17:05.274 --> 17:09.153
That's a dangerous path, Félix.

17:09.236 --> 17:11.530
I wonder if you have thought this through.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.241
Don't worry.

17:16.118 --> 17:17.202
I've thought this through.

17:18.871 --> 17:22.249
And your partners, are they on board?

17:23.292 --> 17:24.752
I don't have partners.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.921
I have employees.

17:32.384 --> 17:33.385
So...

17:34.845 --> 17:36.430
I assume we have a deal.

17:47.441 --> 17:48.942
Make that to go.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.361
He's not staying.

18:06.043 --> 18:07.795
Enjoy, Miguel Ángel.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.686
-Be careful.
-Yes, sir.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.358
The asshole asked for more time.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.986
Told him he could have it.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.696
But from now on he's paying me in product.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.406
-Retail?
-Yeah.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.408
Thought we were done with that.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.702
After what happened last time...

18:40.786 --> 18:43.664
Sylmar changed that.
This is an opportunity.

18:44.331 --> 18:46.375
It's a gamble, a dangerous one.

18:47.042 --> 18:49.336
The plaza bosses just lost a lot of money.

18:49.419 --> 18:50.796
They won't be happy.

18:51.421 --> 18:54.299
And a move this big should be discussed.
By everyone.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.969
It's done, Azul.

18:57.594 --> 18:59.221
That won't go over well.

19:00.597 --> 19:02.599
The plazas see themselves as partners now.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.059
What is it with you, Azul?

19:05.352 --> 19:07.354
Are you their spokesperson now?

19:07.938 --> 19:09.273
Who do you work for?

19:12.359 --> 19:13.360
That's right.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.613
Call a meeting of the plazas.

19:17.906 --> 19:21.118
I need to see their faces
so I know who I can count on.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.582
Azul, come here.

19:29.209 --> 19:31.211
I've made a decision on Güero Palma.

20:24.765 --> 20:27.017
- Don't worry, it's just me.

20:27.851 --> 20:29.519
Sweetie, go to the bedroom.

20:36.401 --> 20:37.819
What are you doing here?

20:38.987 --> 20:40.197
How'd you find us?

20:40.864 --> 20:43.951
It's not easy to hide from Félix.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.411
He knows you've been here,

20:46.495 --> 20:48.413
hiding out with the kids
for the last few weeks.

20:48.497 --> 20:51.250
-Oh, shit.
-Wait, relax.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.626
Everything's cool.

20:52.709 --> 20:54.711
Félix decided to give Héctor a pass.

20:55.545 --> 20:58.173
Clemency, to help smooth things out
with the plaza bosses.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.758
I'm here to take you home.

21:17.776 --> 21:18.986
Look at that.

21:19.611 --> 21:20.862
Beautiful.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.615
Yeah. Nice.

21:30.664 --> 21:33.083
Hey, let's pull over...

21:35.711 --> 21:37.296
get some fresh air,

21:37.879 --> 21:39.256
take a break.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.217
Sure.

21:43.510 --> 21:44.511
Pull over.

21:45.470 --> 21:46.388
All right.

22:02.654 --> 22:04.197
You two stay in the car.

22:04.906 --> 22:07.034
Don't get out. Take care of your brother.

22:16.460 --> 22:17.753
So beautiful.

22:18.420 --> 22:19.421
Yes.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.013
Listen, I need to talk to you
about something.

22:34.394 --> 22:36.855
What we had, it was exciting.

22:39.107 --> 22:40.567
I care a lot about you.

22:43.111 --> 22:46.406
But I love my husband and my family.

22:47.741 --> 22:50.410
Once I get back,
we can't keep seeing each other.

22:53.663 --> 22:54.748
I know.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.097
-Are you all right?
- Yes.

23:12.557 --> 23:15.102
I'm sorry, Guadalupe.
I don't have a choice.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.990
Don't worry, kids,
everything's going to be fine.

23:43.422 --> 23:44.256
<i>What's up?</i>

23:44.339 --> 23:45.632
<i>It's done.</i>

23:47.259 --> 23:49.219
<i>Boss, can I--?</i>

24:34.806 --> 24:35.974
Out of my way!

24:37.225 --> 24:38.935
Juan! What happened?

24:39.019 --> 24:41.938
Saying a grease fire
probably broke out in the kitchen.

24:47.527 --> 24:49.404
Sit on your ass on your own time, asshole!

24:49.946 --> 24:51.239
Put out the fire!

24:52.199 --> 24:54.242
-Put it out!
-Yes, sir, Don Juan.

24:55.243 --> 24:58.330
That's bullshit.
Wasn't a fucking accident.

24:58.413 --> 25:00.290
That skinny motherfucker in Guadalajara.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.209
He's back.

25:03.043 --> 25:04.961
Hear what he just did
to Héctor Palma's family?

25:10.884 --> 25:11.718
<i>Yes.</i>

25:12.594 --> 25:13.595
Right.

25:15.263 --> 25:16.306
Goodbye.

25:25.941 --> 25:28.026
I thought it was from a rabbit.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.487
Rabbit?

25:30.570 --> 25:32.781
Rabbits don't produce eggs.

25:32.864 --> 25:34.616
They eat them, maybe.

25:34.699 --> 25:35.534
Oh.

25:35.617 --> 25:37.536
Look, it has dots--

25:37.619 --> 25:40.372
See what I found, Mama.

25:40.455 --> 25:43.375
Go up to your room, Abril.
And close the door.

25:43.458 --> 25:45.961
- Mama.
- Listen to your mother.

25:48.338 --> 25:49.339
What's up?

25:50.465 --> 25:51.466
Did you do it?

25:52.634 --> 25:54.427
- What are you talking about?
-You know.

25:55.679 --> 25:56.930
I don't.

26:01.643 --> 26:02.936
Guadalupe Palma,

26:03.520 --> 26:04.521
her children.

26:06.147 --> 26:09.776
Whatever this is, you don't want
to have this conversation.

26:09.859 --> 26:10.860
-No, I do.
-Don't touch me.

26:10.944 --> 26:12.946
-Did you kill Güero's family?
-Shut up.

26:13.029 --> 26:16.116
I'm not gonna fucking shut up! Answer me!

26:19.244 --> 26:20.537
Did you kill them?

26:22.706 --> 26:24.416
I need them to fear me.

26:25.458 --> 26:27.711
The men who work for me
need to be kept in line.

26:27.794 --> 26:30.213
You're worse than I thought.

26:30.297 --> 26:33.133
There was an opening, and I made a move.

26:33.842 --> 26:35.885
That's what I do, María.

26:35.969 --> 26:37.512
You were a good man once.

26:37.596 --> 26:40.473
Before all the lies started,
before all the whores you fucked,

26:40.557 --> 26:42.350
before betraying your friends...

26:42.434 --> 26:43.476
Rafa! Neto!

26:44.102 --> 26:45.937
Comes with the territory, right?

26:46.021 --> 26:47.230
Along with the big house,

26:48.064 --> 26:50.317
-all that fucking jewelry.
-I never asked for that shit.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.236
You didn't have to, did you?

26:53.820 --> 26:55.322
You killed Güero Palma's children.

26:55.405 --> 26:57.824
Fuck him, fucking Güero  Palma.

26:57.907 --> 26:59.909
I want you to leave!
Get the fuck out of this house!

26:59.993 --> 27:01.536
Get in your fucking car and leave.

27:01.620 --> 27:05.373
I'm not going anywhere. Come here.
So now you're terrified?

27:05.457 --> 27:06.833
What about your family?

27:07.334 --> 27:08.835
Should we talk about your dad?

27:08.918 --> 27:10.754
-Don't compare yourself to my father.
-No?

27:10.837 --> 27:13.298
He always protected his family.
He loved us.

27:14.341 --> 27:18.345
You don't love anything. You can't.
You're fucking broken inside.

27:18.428 --> 27:20.305
Go! Get out of here, leave now!

27:20.388 --> 27:22.432
I'm not leaving.
You are my family, and I'm staying.

27:22.515 --> 27:25.685
When have you ever
cared about your family?

27:25.769 --> 27:28.063
Get out!

27:28.730 --> 27:31.024
Get out! Leave now!

27:31.608 --> 27:34.152
Enough, put that down. Put that down.

27:34.235 --> 27:37.030
If you come back, I swear I'll kill you.
I swear!

28:00.762 --> 28:02.263
It's insane, Benjamín.

28:02.847 --> 28:04.224
Can you imagine?

28:04.641 --> 28:06.267
Félix is trying to scare all of us.

28:07.477 --> 28:08.645
I'd say it's working then.

28:10.814 --> 28:12.941
Félix ordered all of us to a meeting.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.609
All the plazas.

28:15.944 --> 28:16.861
What for?

28:17.404 --> 28:18.238
Not sure.

28:18.321 --> 28:19.614
Ehh.

28:20.323 --> 28:21.908
He's going to fuck us over.

28:21.991 --> 28:23.827
-Again.

28:24.452 --> 28:26.955
He won't ever stop, Benjamín,
not as long as we work for him.

28:27.038 --> 28:28.039
That's it.

28:29.416 --> 28:30.417
I know.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.627
If you know,
then what are you going to do?

28:34.713 --> 28:36.840
Félix is the one with the coke, my dear.

28:38.383 --> 28:39.676
What can I do?

28:47.183 --> 28:49.436
What if we had our own connection
in Colombia?

28:51.646 --> 28:54.107
<i>Have to say I'm surprised.</i>

28:54.190 --> 28:55.734
How did you get this number?

28:59.779 --> 29:02.615
And what is it that you and I
need to discuss, exactly?

29:41.237 --> 29:45.950
I had Azul call you here
so we can discuss what comes next.

29:48.953 --> 29:50.330
As of today,

29:51.247 --> 29:55.668
the Federation's moving into cocaine sales
in the US.

29:58.421 --> 30:03.134
Before long, we'll push the Colombians
out of the market altogether.

30:03.968 --> 30:05.428
What about the money they owe us?

30:07.263 --> 30:08.389
What about it?

30:09.349 --> 30:11.351
We're talking about power, Aguilar.

30:12.185 --> 30:15.146
Real power on both sides of the border.

30:15.230 --> 30:18.274
But when do we see money?

30:18.858 --> 30:21.569
Changing how things work
is gonna take time.

30:21.653 --> 30:22.737
Exactly.

30:23.446 --> 30:24.614
Exactly, Francisco.

30:25.532 --> 30:27.992
It will take some time,
just have to hang in there.

30:28.576 --> 30:30.161
Just be patient.

30:30.245 --> 30:32.205
Three months, six,

30:32.747 --> 30:33.748
maybe even a year.

30:36.751 --> 30:40.421
And the decision for this transformation,
when did we make it?

30:41.089 --> 30:42.257
We didn't.

30:43.591 --> 30:45.468
I made this decision.

30:47.804 --> 30:49.264
Listen, man,

30:49.931 --> 30:54.102
I have the protection,
I have the product, transportation.

30:55.562 --> 30:57.438
Don't get confused, Benjamín.

30:57.981 --> 30:59.482
We are partners,

30:59.566 --> 31:00.984
but this is my vision.

31:01.901 --> 31:04.153
So the rumors are true.

31:04.237 --> 31:06.781
You tipped them off on Sylmar.

31:11.452 --> 31:12.537
Yeah.

31:13.288 --> 31:14.497
It was me.

31:16.124 --> 31:19.836
You only see what's
in front of you, right?

31:19.919 --> 31:23.715
I'm talking about
running the Colombians out of business.

31:25.133 --> 31:26.467
It's about control.

31:29.053 --> 31:30.638
I'm talking about the future.

31:31.806 --> 31:34.475
This meeting is to see
who has the same vision as me.

31:34.559 --> 31:36.686
Who's on board and who isn't.

31:43.401 --> 31:45.445
My family is pulling out
of the Federation.

31:52.368 --> 31:53.453
Fine.

31:53.953 --> 31:56.205
It's all right, Benjamín. Good luck.

31:56.789 --> 31:58.041
Just be careful.

31:59.542 --> 32:03.129
I hear Tijuana is...
a little dangerous right now.

32:05.298 --> 32:07.759
Tijuana belongs
to the Arellano Félix family.

32:08.259 --> 32:09.427
Don't forget.

32:20.813 --> 32:21.981
Sinaloa's out.

32:29.489 --> 32:30.907
I'm with Guzmán.

32:31.908 --> 32:33.534
We're keeping Sinaloa.

32:34.369 --> 32:35.787
Palma is coming back.

32:36.579 --> 32:38.414
Things have changed, Félix.

32:46.255 --> 32:49.092
No, Azul. Nothing has changed.

32:51.594 --> 32:54.847
Rats will always be rats.

32:58.518 --> 33:00.520
Get the fuck out, Azul.

33:14.659 --> 33:17.620
Pablo Acosta was full of shit, mostly.

33:18.037 --> 33:21.207
But he was right about a couple things.

33:23.126 --> 33:26.796
The price of being in business with you
is too high.

33:29.757 --> 33:31.342
I'm out too, man.

33:32.593 --> 33:35.179
Me and Aguilar are taking Juárez.

33:57.326 --> 33:59.579
You all got together, huh?

34:01.581 --> 34:02.999
I spoke with Cali.

34:04.792 --> 34:08.588
Guaranteed them Mexico
can keep moving their coke.

34:08.671 --> 34:12.467
But I told them it was us or you.

34:15.511 --> 34:17.430
They chose us.

34:22.769 --> 34:24.437
You're out, man.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.868
So now you run the Federation?

34:38.951 --> 34:41.079
Who, me? No.

34:41.162 --> 34:44.916
There's no more Federation.

34:45.416 --> 34:48.544
We all operate separately,
run our own territory.

34:50.129 --> 34:51.964
It's better that way.

34:56.469 --> 34:57.512
It's over.

35:05.228 --> 35:06.562
How long?

35:08.106 --> 35:10.274
How long you been planning
to fuck me over?

35:11.275 --> 35:14.028
Been waiting for the right time.

35:15.029 --> 35:16.781
I took you out on my own,

35:16.864 --> 35:20.201
people get nervous.

35:21.702 --> 35:23.621
This way, everyone owned a piece.

35:24.330 --> 35:26.124
They don't see me as a threat.

35:40.596 --> 35:42.974
You can run,

35:43.057 --> 35:46.435
but it won't matter.

35:47.645 --> 35:49.480
You wouldn't have any of this without me.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.107
I know.

35:51.649 --> 35:53.276
I haven't forgotten.

35:55.695 --> 35:56.696
Fine.

35:58.865 --> 36:01.242
Fuck you, Amado.

36:40.114 --> 36:41.949
You got some weird call from D.C.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.492
Put the message on your desk.

36:48.915 --> 36:50.291
When'd this come in?

36:51.083 --> 36:52.210
Ten minutes ago.

36:54.879 --> 36:57.506
Hey, you're gonna get
to those open status reports, right?

36:58.883 --> 36:59.884
Yeah.

37:00.509 --> 37:01.928
Yeah, sorry about that.

37:30.039 --> 37:31.582
Good morning.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.423
What's up, Isabella?

37:43.052 --> 37:44.512
What are you doing here, Benjamín?

37:44.595 --> 37:47.265
Came to check out your place. It's nice.

37:51.310 --> 37:52.728
What's going on?

37:53.646 --> 37:55.398
I talked to my brothers, Isabella.

37:56.732 --> 37:57.817
I told them.

37:58.609 --> 38:00.069
You're being bought out.

38:00.945 --> 38:03.364
I ran it through some properties
I put in your name,

38:04.198 --> 38:05.992
then repurchased.

38:06.075 --> 38:07.243
It's clean.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.370
And generous.

38:24.802 --> 38:25.928
What is this?

38:26.971 --> 38:28.097
Your end.

38:28.764 --> 38:32.143
For going away.
Tijuana's closed for business.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.353
-I'm not leaving Tijuana.
- Ah.

38:36.022 --> 38:39.442
Look, my family's left the Federation.

38:41.402 --> 38:43.237
We're taking Tijuana for ourselves.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.573
I'll be working with my brothers now.

38:46.240 --> 38:48.951
You sold out our business
to your brothers?

38:49.035 --> 38:50.619
Where'd you think we'd end up?

38:51.370 --> 38:52.580
There's a limit.

38:52.663 --> 38:54.457
No, there isn't.

38:56.709 --> 38:58.085
Fuck you.

38:58.169 --> 39:01.464
I don't need a handout from the woman
I thought was my partner.

39:01.964 --> 39:03.591
All of this...

39:04.133 --> 39:05.676
wasn't just about money.

39:06.635 --> 39:08.721
Don't make this more difficult
than it has to be.

39:09.889 --> 39:11.057
Oh, sweetheart,

39:11.807 --> 39:14.226
I've been difficult my whole fucking life.

39:39.126 --> 39:40.711
- Federal police!

39:44.173 --> 39:45.758
This way.

39:48.094 --> 39:49.095
Let's go!

39:54.934 --> 39:56.769
Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo,

39:57.728 --> 39:59.105
you're under arrest.

40:00.314 --> 40:04.693
There's $5 million
in a safe upstairs, <i>comandante.</i>

40:05.611 --> 40:07.029
Not interested.

40:13.577 --> 40:15.246
So it is an arrest.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.331
No one's here.

40:20.543 --> 40:22.128
Makes sense.

40:25.339 --> 40:27.049
Arrest's a better headline.

40:29.468 --> 40:31.429
"Justice served."

40:32.596 --> 40:34.807
Keep your mouth shut, you live.

40:35.933 --> 40:38.853
That's the only deal Mexico City's giving.

41:00.040 --> 41:01.792
Hand me my cigarettes.

41:18.225 --> 41:20.895
<i>On April 8th, 1989,</i>

41:21.479 --> 41:26.317
<i>Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo was arrested</i>
<i>at his home in Guadalajara.</i>

41:26.859 --> 41:28.611
<i>The country's number-one fugitive,</i>

41:28.694 --> 41:32.156
<i>the most powerful drug trafficker</i>
<i>Mexico had ever seen,</i>

41:32.239 --> 41:35.784
<i>was taken into custody</i>
<i>without a single shot being fired.</i>

41:35.868 --> 41:38.662
<i>Four months into</i>
<i>the new Mexican president's term,</i>

41:39.246 --> 41:41.081
<i>it was a badly needed win</i>

41:41.165 --> 41:42.917
<i>in more ways than one.</i>

41:43.000 --> 41:45.503
<i>The arrest went down</i>
<i>right as Congress was considering</i>

41:45.586 --> 41:50.132
<i>whether or not to certify that Mexico</i>
<i>was cooperating in stopping drugs.</i>

41:51.217 --> 41:54.762
<i>Not sure why the world's biggest junkie</i>
<i>was in a position to judge,</i>

41:54.845 --> 41:56.805
<i>but that's another story.</i>

41:57.848 --> 42:01.560
<i>Both Mexican and American officials</i>
<i>said there was no connection</i>

42:01.644 --> 42:05.731
<i>between Félix's arrest</i>
<i>and the pending certification vote.</i>

42:06.315 --> 42:07.483
<i>Of course there wasn't.</i>

42:08.067 --> 42:11.654
<i>Certification would help polish up</i>
<i>the optics of the big new trade deal</i>

42:11.737 --> 42:13.739
<i>that was being negotiated.</i>

42:14.532 --> 42:18.619
<i>A stamp of approval</i>
<i>so big business could sell more shit.</i>

42:19.245 --> 42:23.290
<i>Ink was barely dry on Félix's arrest sheet</i>
<i>when, what do you know,</i>

42:23.374 --> 42:25.751
<i>Mexico's certification came through.</i>

42:26.377 --> 42:27.836
<i>And just like that,</i>

42:27.920 --> 42:31.924
<i>the last real hurdle to the trade deal</i>
<i>to end all trade deals</i>

42:32.007 --> 42:33.217
<i>had been cleared.</i>

42:53.404 --> 42:54.697
Congratulations.

42:57.825 --> 42:59.702
What the fuck happened here?

43:00.327 --> 43:01.537
The machine turned on him.

43:01.620 --> 43:04.248
Bullshit. He built the machine.

43:05.207 --> 43:07.084
He wore out his welcome with the party.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.169
And the plaza bosses.

43:10.588 --> 43:11.714
Yeah.

43:13.924 --> 43:15.509
So, what happens next?

43:17.469 --> 43:18.846
I guess we'll see.

43:20.889 --> 43:23.559
You know,
the deputy director in D.C. called me.

43:23.642 --> 43:25.728
Told me you requested me down here
by name.

43:26.437 --> 43:28.147
You wanted me here for the arrest.

43:29.189 --> 43:31.358
But clearly, you don't need my help.

43:32.735 --> 43:33.819
So why me?

43:34.403 --> 43:36.196
Everyone likes good headlines, Walt.

43:38.407 --> 43:39.992
After all the shit that went down,

43:40.993 --> 43:42.578
seemed like you could use a win.

43:43.871 --> 43:46.415
You never know when you're gonna
need a friend in our line of work.

43:46.498 --> 43:48.459
I'm not your fucking friend, man.

43:49.460 --> 43:51.128
I can promise you that.

43:54.757 --> 43:56.550
I'll see you around, Walt.

43:59.386 --> 44:00.721
Yes, you will.

44:05.184 --> 44:09.313
Operation Leyenda
was a mission for justice,

44:09.396 --> 44:13.150
for Kiki Camarena,
and all who have fallen victim

44:13.233 --> 44:16.111
to the scourge
of violent narcotics trafficking.

44:16.820 --> 44:20.824
Today, thanks to the tireless efforts
of the DEA

44:20.908 --> 44:23.952
and our dedicated partners
in Mexican law enforcement,

44:24.036 --> 44:27.206
we're able to say, "Mission accomplished."

44:28.082 --> 44:30.000
Congratulations, all around.

44:30.084 --> 44:31.001
-Fine work.

44:31.085 --> 44:32.252
Well done.

44:32.836 --> 44:34.129
Great job.

44:34.880 --> 44:36.256
-Great job.
-Ted.

44:37.466 --> 44:39.301
Ted Kaye, State Department. What an honor.

44:39.385 --> 44:41.261
- Over here, sir.
-We've met before.

44:41.345 --> 44:42.388
Thank you, sir.

44:42.471 --> 44:43.472
One more time.

44:43.555 --> 44:46.809
Exceptional stuff, special agent.
My goodness, exceptional.

44:50.479 --> 44:52.106
That's suitable for framing.

44:52.731 --> 44:53.899
A win's a win.

44:54.692 --> 44:57.027
I hear it helped punch your ticket
out of Sacramento.

44:57.111 --> 44:58.612
I'm in El Paso now.

44:59.321 --> 45:00.531
Back in the game.

45:01.031 --> 45:02.741
Can't get enough of that border, huh?

45:03.701 --> 45:06.787
I know your boss down there,
Jaime Kuykendall.

45:07.246 --> 45:09.164
Yeah, he mentioned
the two of you knew each other.

45:10.916 --> 45:12.084
Let me ask you something.

45:13.377 --> 45:15.212
How's all this sit with you?

45:17.506 --> 45:19.049
That's not the job, Walt.

45:22.010 --> 45:23.262
Good luck in El Paso.

45:47.494 --> 45:48.704
That's all of it.

45:49.663 --> 45:50.998
Move it to the back.

45:51.874 --> 45:53.500
Get the truck out of here.

46:08.182 --> 46:09.933
There a problem, captain?

46:10.017 --> 46:12.060
I paid my cut to the precinct
through next month.

46:12.144 --> 46:13.353
New orders.

46:19.485 --> 46:21.945
This is Arellano Félix territory,

46:22.029 --> 46:23.071
and you, sweetheart,

46:23.781 --> 46:24.990
are trespassing.

46:26.784 --> 46:27.785
Take her away.

46:29.036 --> 46:31.622
It's okay. Move the car.

46:40.172 --> 46:41.507
It's done.

46:56.396 --> 46:58.774
I don't know. I can't decide.

46:59.274 --> 47:00.400
What do you think?

47:01.235 --> 47:04.363
Well, with such lovely legs,

47:05.155 --> 47:06.865
either one will look...

47:07.366 --> 47:08.659
very good on you.

47:09.493 --> 47:12.329
All right, maybe both then.

47:12.913 --> 47:13.914
Why not.

47:14.456 --> 47:16.041
Very well, why not.

47:16.625 --> 47:17.876
I'll get the other pair.

47:17.960 --> 47:18.877
Thank you.

48:44.838 --> 48:47.007
<i>We all know why we're here.</i>

48:48.759 --> 48:52.888
Any business needs understanding
among its participants.

48:53.472 --> 48:55.015
As we've already agreed...

48:57.100 --> 48:58.810
the men at this table

48:59.478 --> 49:01.021
will run their own plazas

49:01.563 --> 49:03.607
independently.

49:05.484 --> 49:09.404
Benjamín Arellano Félix and his family,
Tijuana.

49:10.030 --> 49:11.114
Myself,

49:12.115 --> 49:13.325
Héctor Palma,

49:14.660 --> 49:17.204
and our junior partner, Chapo Guzmán...

49:18.747 --> 49:19.957
Sinaloa.

49:21.833 --> 49:24.378
Juan Guerra and his nephew Juan Ábrego,

49:24.878 --> 49:25.963
the Gulf.

49:28.215 --> 49:29.758
Amado Carrillo Fuentes

49:30.884 --> 49:32.803
and Comandante Rafael Aguilar,

49:33.387 --> 49:34.262
Juárez.

49:36.974 --> 49:38.100
Gentleman,

49:38.976 --> 49:41.603
as long as we all respect each other,

49:41.687 --> 49:43.480
we can all prosper.

49:44.356 --> 49:45.524
It's that simple.

49:47.067 --> 49:51.697
But what we agree to today
is to put the future above the past.

49:53.281 --> 49:54.282
Understood?

49:54.366 --> 49:55.534
Understood.

49:55.617 --> 49:56.618
Yes.

49:58.620 --> 49:59.663
Güero, understood?

50:00.622 --> 50:01.707
Yes.

50:03.917 --> 50:05.168
A toast then...

50:06.336 --> 50:07.379
to the future

50:07.462 --> 50:10.632
and to our business,
may it continue for many years to come.

50:11.425 --> 50:13.051
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

50:13.135 --> 50:14.428
Cheers!

50:19.224 --> 50:20.392
Hey, Joaquín...

50:22.602 --> 50:23.895
no more fighting, all right?

50:51.089 --> 50:52.591
Working late.

50:55.010 --> 50:57.512
Yeah. You are too.

50:59.222 --> 51:00.348
You, uh...

51:01.391 --> 51:02.976
You always read standing?

51:05.103 --> 51:08.857
Yeah, my back's been bothering me.

51:11.693 --> 51:14.196
Probably should crack a window next time.

51:16.281 --> 51:17.741
Oh, right.

51:21.369 --> 51:22.662
How you settling in?

51:25.457 --> 51:27.084
Hear you've been doing a lot of reading.

51:28.418 --> 51:31.838
Yeah, I'm just...
I'm trying to figure out what's next.

51:33.715 --> 51:35.926
That sounds ambitious. Any luck?

51:36.426 --> 51:38.261
-Nope.

51:39.179 --> 51:40.305
Yeah.

51:40.931 --> 51:43.934
Well, if that changes,
you make sure you let me know.

51:44.017 --> 51:45.102
Yes, sir.

51:48.188 --> 51:49.898
See you Monday, Agent Breslin.

51:49.981 --> 51:51.942
-Yes, sir.
-You take care of that back.

51:54.486 --> 51:55.612
Sir?

51:57.322 --> 52:00.742
You have any juice with the Minister
of Public Security down in Mexico City?

52:03.453 --> 52:05.497
I got somebody I need to talk to.

52:37.487 --> 52:38.989
You know who I am?

52:39.990 --> 52:42.117
No, not a fucking idea.

52:43.618 --> 52:46.705
But with that fucking accent,
I'm sure I could guess.

52:49.875 --> 52:52.294
Told myself I'd show you this one day.

52:59.634 --> 53:01.094
He had a family.

53:07.017 --> 53:08.143
Yeah.

53:10.103 --> 53:13.481
Isn't that the agent that was murdered?

53:15.192 --> 53:16.276
It is, right?

53:18.445 --> 53:21.072
They say he was badly tortured.

53:23.533 --> 53:25.911
That they put holes in his entire body

53:26.536 --> 53:28.955
with a power drill. Right?

53:32.792 --> 53:36.046
If you think I'm the reason
Camarena's dead,

53:37.172 --> 53:39.466
you're stupider than you look.

53:40.217 --> 53:41.343
Oh.

53:43.637 --> 53:47.641
The way I see it,
you got sold out for a fucking trade deal.

53:49.643 --> 53:51.937
Why hold back now?

53:54.606 --> 53:56.274
You got names...

53:58.318 --> 53:59.569
I'm listening.

54:00.904 --> 54:03.823
If I want to kill myself, I'll use a rope.

54:06.159 --> 54:07.827
Guess I'll have to be...

54:08.912 --> 54:12.249
satisfied with you sitting in this hole
for however long you can hang on.

54:14.167 --> 54:15.335
Enjoy.

54:38.942 --> 54:41.194
What happened? You were leaving?

54:43.029 --> 54:44.447
Okay, asshole.

54:45.532 --> 54:46.616
Tell me...

54:47.701 --> 54:51.121
what happens to the plazas
you used to control?

54:52.831 --> 54:54.624
I didn't control anything.

54:55.875 --> 54:57.502
You're confusing me.

55:00.672 --> 55:03.008
But I've heard of a couple of things.

55:05.635 --> 55:07.220
I've heard the plazas...

55:08.638 --> 55:11.349
will become their own cartels.

55:13.101 --> 55:14.769
They'll work separately.

55:16.396 --> 55:17.772
At first...

55:20.692 --> 55:22.193
it won't be so bad.

55:23.778 --> 55:25.947
With luck, they'll work together.

55:27.699 --> 55:29.409
But then...

55:31.745 --> 55:34.289
they'll all want the best routes,

55:36.041 --> 55:37.459
the best product,

55:38.335 --> 55:41.212
access to the top dogs in the government.

55:42.881 --> 55:45.008
That's when the fireworks will start.

55:47.260 --> 55:48.845
Tijuana will get stronger.

55:49.763 --> 55:52.766
But once they consolidate power,

55:53.725 --> 55:54.934
watch out.

55:56.811 --> 55:58.605
War will break out.

56:01.816 --> 56:03.068
With who?

56:04.444 --> 56:05.737
Sinaloa.

56:07.572 --> 56:10.325
Sinaloa has soldiers...

56:11.993 --> 56:13.787
<i>but needs a border.</i>

56:14.746 --> 56:15.955
<i>And Tijuana</i>

56:16.706 --> 56:17.999
<i>has a border.</i>

56:19.542 --> 56:21.211
<i>If those idiots merged,</i>

56:22.087 --> 56:23.797
<i>no one would stop them, but...</i>

56:24.839 --> 56:26.674
they can't wrap their heads around it.

56:28.718 --> 56:30.845
It's personal with them.

56:31.930 --> 56:35.642
While those two plazas keep fighting,
the Gulf will watch.

56:36.393 --> 56:37.977
Getting stronger,

56:38.061 --> 56:40.647
while those assholes get weaker.

56:44.109 --> 56:45.985
Now I'll raise my glass

56:46.611 --> 56:49.572
to toast for the simple pleasure
of making a lot of fucking money.

56:50.073 --> 56:51.491
Stand up.

56:51.574 --> 56:52.617
Let's toast.

56:53.493 --> 56:55.120
Cheers.

56:56.287 --> 56:58.039
<i>But the key to all of it is Juárez.</i>

56:58.623 --> 57:01.501
<i>Once the trade deal is done,</i>

57:02.085 --> 57:05.004
<i>Juárez will be strong enough</i>
<i>to square off with anyone.</i>

57:06.047 --> 57:08.216
<i>If they make the right moves...</i>

57:10.009 --> 57:12.762
<i>Amado Carrillo Fuentes.</i>

57:15.723 --> 57:17.642
<i>Learn that name, gringo.</i>

57:20.311 --> 57:24.691
He could be the most powerful trafficker
this country's ever seen.

57:26.734 --> 57:29.154
Unless someone with bigger balls

57:29.863 --> 57:31.614
puts a bullet in his head.

57:35.910 --> 57:37.954
It's just an idea.

57:42.834 --> 57:44.461
Got the whole game figured out...

57:45.753 --> 57:49.132
but still ended up in here.

57:52.093 --> 57:53.970
I wanted more.

57:56.639 --> 57:58.766
Sinaloans are like that.

58:01.936 --> 58:03.688
What the fuck are you doing here?

58:03.771 --> 58:04.898
What do you want?

58:06.649 --> 58:07.775
I mean,

58:08.902 --> 58:11.988
you don't give a shit about him.
He's not your friend...

58:12.071 --> 58:14.240
or wasn't.

58:15.825 --> 58:19.078
You don't give a shit about drugs either.
So what are you doing here?

58:21.414 --> 58:24.292
I don't know, maybe
I just like putting assholes in jail.

58:26.419 --> 58:27.670
Really?

58:28.338 --> 58:29.923
I think...

58:30.507 --> 58:34.677
you like to break things and hurt people,
like most people from your country.

58:37.514 --> 58:38.556
What?

58:39.098 --> 58:40.725
You didn't like what I said?

58:42.560 --> 58:44.395
Did you expect to hear something else?

58:47.065 --> 58:48.441
Well, you're fucked.

58:48.525 --> 58:49.442
Hmm?

58:50.360 --> 58:52.278
The madness has begun...

58:53.071 --> 58:54.614
and no one can stop it.

58:55.990 --> 58:56.908
Without me,

58:57.784 --> 58:59.118
no one can stop it.

59:00.161 --> 59:03.039
DEA should've given me a badge.

59:06.709 --> 59:09.128
You'll be drowning in blood...

59:11.089 --> 59:12.173
chaos.

59:13.883 --> 59:16.928
Now you'll see what happens
when the cage breaks open

59:18.346 --> 59:20.640
and all the animals run free.

59:27.855 --> 59:29.357
You're going to miss me.
