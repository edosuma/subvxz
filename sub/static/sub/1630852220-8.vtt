01:52.960 --> 01:54.758
Mimmo, come take a look!

01:54.760 --> 01:57.000
- Stop!
- Giovanni, come take a look.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.160
Never seen anything like it,
it's unbelievable.

02:30.960 --> 02:32.518
- Good morning, Gianni.
- Good morning, ma'am.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.878
- Did you tell anyone else?
- No, just you.

02:34.880 --> 02:37.440
Come, this way.

02:50.360 --> 02:52.520
And what do we do now?

02:56.680 --> 02:58.160
I have to notify Mr. Resta.

03:03.240 --> 03:05.438
Can I rely on the silence
of your workers?

03:05.440 --> 03:08.240
- I guarantee it personally.
- Thank you.

03:37.280 --> 03:38.880
Hi, man.

03:50.960 --> 03:54.518
Well? Do we have any more information?

03:54.520 --> 03:58.318
As we thought:
illegal dumping from a cemetery.

03:58.320 --> 04:01.478
I really don't see the problem.

04:01.480 --> 04:04.478
They've been dead for over 40 years
and don't have relatives,

04:04.480 --> 04:06.918
or they would have seen to them.

04:06.920 --> 04:11.958
What difference does it make if they're
in an ossuary or under a carpark?

04:11.960 --> 04:16.158
Besides, Gennaro, cemeteries
swindle money from City Hall

04:16.160 --> 04:19.637
and we should pay
for the fraud they commit?

04:19.640 --> 04:23.440
Listen, we'll put them back
where they were and close it up.

04:28.840 --> 04:31.120
Come here, Alberto.

04:42.760 --> 04:46.880
- What are we building?
- An airport.

04:49.760 --> 04:53.200
How many others have tried
to build another airport in this city?

04:54.400 --> 04:56.880
Only we succeeded.

04:59.280 --> 05:02.118
You know why?

05:02.120 --> 05:05.798
Because we've done
everything by the book.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.918
Without greasing palms,
without offending anyone

05:08.920 --> 05:12.118
and especially without fucking up.

05:12.120 --> 05:17.118
Now, if we do as you suggest
and it comes out,

05:17.120 --> 05:19.720
we'll blow everything
we've done 'til now.

05:24.440 --> 05:25.880
Pardon me.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.760
I have to take this, I'll be right back.

05:33.840 --> 05:36.320
Hi, Fernando. How come at this hour?

05:37.840 --> 05:40.120
Hold on, I'll just go in the office.

05:47.640 --> 05:52.878
- You don't agree with him, do you?
- I know these people well.

05:52.880 --> 05:55.998
It's impossible that the workers
will all keep quiet.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.400
It'll come out for sure
and, at that point, we risk big.

06:03.520 --> 06:05.878
What would you do?

06:05.880 --> 06:09.240
I'd get ahead of it
and go into damage control.

06:11.720 --> 06:15.200
- What can happen?
- The prosecutor will open a file.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.520
Okay, let's go.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.320
It's him. Guys!

06:54.440 --> 06:57.838
- Good morning everyone.
- Mr Resta, what can you tell us?

06:57.840 --> 07:02.558
I can't tell you much
because it's still under investigation.

07:02.560 --> 07:05.958
However, I'd like to stress
that our consortium

07:05.960 --> 07:09.918
has always acted
lawfully, transparently.

07:09.920 --> 07:14.198
Although we are the injured party
in this sad situation,

07:14.200 --> 07:18.678
we have decided to cover
the cost of the operation

07:18.680 --> 07:24.838
<i>for the removal of the remains
that criminals have buried in our land,</i>

07:24.840 --> 07:28.758
<i>freeing the council from an expense
it already shouldered.</i>

07:28.760 --> 07:33.638
<i>We are investing in this area
because we believe in it,</i>

07:33.640 --> 07:36.438
<i>we believe in opportunities
that can be created</i>

07:36.440 --> 07:39.358
<i>based on work and transparency.</i>

07:39.360 --> 07:42.960
<i>This was the statement
from Alberto Resta...</i>

07:45.360 --> 07:47.358
- He was good.
- The voice is his.

07:47.360 --> 07:49.478
But the brain behind him is Tiziana's.

07:49.480 --> 07:53.358
It was her idea to report parties
unknown for the dumping of waste.

07:53.360 --> 07:55.878
But if they shut down the site?

07:55.880 --> 07:58.678
Tiziana says we need
public opinion on our side,

07:58.680 --> 08:03.560
then we'll say this seizure harms us
and the community.

08:07.360 --> 08:10.800
Let's go,
or we'll be late for the school party.

08:32.039 --> 08:36.318
In the end we didn't meet:
Walter Ruggieri, Simone's dad.

08:36.320 --> 08:38.837
Gennaro Savastano, Pietro's dad.

08:38.840 --> 08:42.078
Your last name
is more famous than mine.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.000
It's the price I have to pay.

08:47.560 --> 08:50.158
I know,
I shouldn't in front of the kids.

08:50.160 --> 08:54.520
But there are lots of things
we shouldn't do, but we do, right?

08:58.320 --> 09:02.720
Who we are is sculpted
into our flesh, we can't help it.

09:04.720 --> 09:07.918
My father abandoned me
when I was two months old

09:07.920 --> 09:10.880
and turned up again
when I was 20 years old.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.760
He wanted to meet me.

09:15.880 --> 09:19.678
I went, because I'm not afraid
to go and see.

09:19.680 --> 09:23.000
But that was the day
I decided I didn't want kids.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.358
But your son's right there.

09:27.360 --> 09:30.520
I know. My wife insisted,
she pestered me to death.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.600
And there he is.

09:36.360 --> 09:39.638
The first two years I desperately
looked for feelings inside me,

09:39.640 --> 09:43.958
but I didn't have any,
he just annoyed me when he cried.

09:43.960 --> 09:46.558
I shouldn't say that, I know.

09:46.560 --> 09:49.160
That's why I chose this job.

09:51.040 --> 09:56.038
Justice has no mercy for anyone,
its only companion is the truth.

09:56.040 --> 10:00.200
And the truth is I'm a prosecutor
and you're the son of a missing boss.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.840
But that shitty man who gave me life
still stirs in my blood.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.560
And you?

10:16.920 --> 10:18.480
Excuse me.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.960
What did he want?

10:36.040 --> 10:38.280
He just wanted to introduce himself.

10:41.160 --> 10:43.840
And he wanted to scare me a little.

11:06.480 --> 11:09.558
- Hi, Ferdinando.
- Hi, Alberto.

11:09.560 --> 11:11.640
Well? What's going on?

11:14.160 --> 11:16.758
I've got anti-money laundering
at the bank.

11:16.760 --> 11:20.478
They want to know
how a businessman riddled with debt

11:20.480 --> 11:24.440
found the money to put in the
consortium that's building the airport.

11:25.440 --> 11:30.638
I'm investing in a new company and
with the profits I'll repay my debts.

11:30.640 --> 11:35.558
They've got it in for the company
you used to join the consortium,

11:35.560 --> 11:38.798
as it started out with a capital
of 20 thousand euros,

11:38.800 --> 11:43.318
then received two British investments
and the capital grew to five million.

11:43.320 --> 11:45.558
And?

11:45.560 --> 11:48.518
Trust me, get out of it all now,

11:48.520 --> 11:52.838
go to the prosecutor and give them
the names of who's behind the airport.

11:52.840 --> 11:54.718
There's no name to give.

11:54.720 --> 11:59.198
If the law hasn't changed overnight,
blind trusts are legal.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.438
Sheer conjecture, that's not enough.

12:01.440 --> 12:05.358
But anti-money laundering
doesn't move for no reason.

12:05.360 --> 12:08.400
Are you really willing to pay the price?

12:12.400 --> 12:15.798
The bank wants you
to repay your debt immediately,

12:15.800 --> 12:18.918
or they'll start bankruptcy proceedings.

12:18.920 --> 12:20.320
I see.

12:22.280 --> 12:24.120
Thanks for the heads up.

12:35.520 --> 12:38.278
My Jesus, forgive us our sins.

12:38.280 --> 12:40.958
Save us from the fires of Hell.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.398
Lead all souls to Heaven,

12:43.400 --> 12:47.360
especially those
in most need of Thy mercy.

13:10.240 --> 13:13.560
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost.

13:14.560 --> 13:17.720
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with Thee...

13:25.560 --> 13:27.878
Hello?

13:27.880 --> 13:31.758
Now and at the hour of our death, amen.

13:31.760 --> 13:34.238
Out of the depths I cry to you, O, Lord.

13:34.240 --> 13:36.478
Lord, hear my voice,

13:36.480 --> 13:39.998
let Your ears be attentive
to my cry for mercy.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.280
If You keep a record of sins, Lord,
who could withstand Your judgement?

14:16.360 --> 14:18.678
- Hi, Alberto.
- Hi, Gennaro.

14:18.680 --> 14:23.200
- What's with all the mystery?
- Precautions.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.080
Did you see me today? Was I good?

14:29.960 --> 14:33.520
You were good.
Why did you want to see me?

14:37.520 --> 14:39.880
The bank's asked me to repay my debt.

14:42.280 --> 14:46.240
I dunno, it must be this fucking thing
with the skeletons.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.080
- How much do you owe?
- 150 grand.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.518
Tomorrow morning I'll give you
the names of three companies,

15:00.520 --> 15:04.358
prepare three invoices for consultancy
to the amount you need.

15:04.360 --> 15:06.478
Thanks, Gennaro. You're a friend.

15:06.480 --> 15:09.998
I'm just a businessman
looking after his interests.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.438
If you have problems,
the consortium has problems.

15:13.440 --> 15:14.840
That's all.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.878
Let me through!

15:28.880 --> 15:30.518
You're a robot.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.720
Yeah and I wanna go through...

15:35.240 --> 15:37.320
Now we'll show Mama the robot.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.440
Show her.

15:43.600 --> 15:46.318
Did you show Papa the drawings
you did at school?

15:46.320 --> 15:48.998
You did some drawings?

15:49.000 --> 15:52.318
He did a kite, a house...

15:52.320 --> 15:54.518
Want some coffee?

15:54.520 --> 15:58.918
- Our house?
- A house with the pool.

15:58.920 --> 16:00.958
Did you do a drawing of Papa?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.760
We're done upstairs.

16:05.840 --> 16:09.440
Finish your yoghurt, I'll be right back.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.798
- Well?
- It's all clean here.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.918
But we can't give you 100% certainty.

16:24.920 --> 16:27.598
If they turned off the detectors,
we won't find them.

16:27.600 --> 16:30.678
We'll get our stuff and go, goodbye.

16:30.680 --> 16:32.440
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

16:34.360 --> 16:37.280
If someone got in we would have noticed.

16:39.400 --> 16:42.278
When we're not here,
it's easy to get in.

16:42.280 --> 16:44.680
Gennaro, they didn't find anything.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.520
Maybe I got spooked.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.998
Or maybe that son of bitch told me
that stuff on purpose.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.958
He knew I'd check.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.918
First he planted the doubt
then he took it away.

17:03.920 --> 17:08.000
So, in his mind, I'd go back
to talking normally about our stuff.

17:09.240 --> 17:11.358
And even if that's true?

17:11.359 --> 17:14.319
After today we have nothing bad
to talk about anymore.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.880
Come in.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.560
May I come in?

17:52.520 --> 17:54.640
This is from our family.

17:59.400 --> 18:02.080
It belonged to Mama's grandmother.

18:18.120 --> 18:21.960
Don't give it to me,
wear it when you get married.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.158
No, I'll never get married.

18:26.160 --> 18:31.200
I don't need bosses,
I have enough at home.

18:33.080 --> 18:36.558
First you gotta learn
to be your own boss,

18:36.560 --> 18:39.120
then you can find a man
who loves you and respects you.

18:41.840 --> 18:45.360
The only one who respects me
is marrying you.

18:48.600 --> 18:52.078
A husband and wife can break up,

18:52.080 --> 18:55.600
but brother and sister
will always be brother and sister.

19:03.120 --> 19:04.480
This one's from me.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.760
See, you need it.

19:26.440 --> 19:29.080
I'll always be on your side, Patrizia.

19:30.480 --> 19:33.320
When you enter the church,
today, tomorrow...

19:34.800 --> 19:37.000
I'll always be on your side.

19:38.480 --> 19:40.520
Don't ever forget that.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.280
Give me a hand.

20:04.520 --> 20:06.040
Thank you.

20:29.040 --> 20:31.838
I know we didn't get off
to a good start,

20:31.840 --> 20:34.878
but today we're happy
to welcome you into this family.

20:34.880 --> 20:37.120
Things change.

20:38.120 --> 20:41.240
These are our flowers,
we picked them for you.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.600
Thank you so much.

21:53.160 --> 21:55.480
Look, there's even a pool.

21:57.520 --> 22:00.000
- Shall we sit here?
- Yeah, let's sit here.

22:02.640 --> 22:05.800
Anything you need
there's someone inside, okay?

22:10.120 --> 22:11.640
Here.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.640
- Bye, Pietro.
- Say goodbye to Papa.

22:17.800 --> 22:20.200
Be good.

23:12.640 --> 23:14.520
It's beautiful here, huh?

23:20.360 --> 23:21.680
Yes.

23:56.960 --> 23:58.720
Gennaro!

24:03.200 --> 24:07.520
- Azzurra sends her regards.
- Thank her from me.

24:08.880 --> 24:11.240
Hi, Uncle, all good?

24:13.640 --> 24:17.800
Unfortunately I can't stay, but
I wanted to congratulate you in person.

24:19.720 --> 24:22.120
And we're very glad you came.

24:23.640 --> 24:27.558
Do you mind if I walk the bride
down the aisle?

24:27.560 --> 24:29.640
That's if she agrees.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.080
From today Secondigliano is yours.

25:19.440 --> 25:22.880
Don't give me anything anymore,
keep what you earn.

25:24.120 --> 25:27.920
- It's my wedding present.
- Why?

25:29.520 --> 25:32.118
You're big enough
to walk on your own two feet.

25:32.120 --> 25:35.360
But always be careful
of the people you trust.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.880
Good luck, Patrizia.

25:54.200 --> 25:58.878
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost.

25:58.880 --> 26:01.038
- Amen.
- The Lord be with you.

26:01.040 --> 26:03.238
And with your spirit.

26:03.240 --> 26:07.798
Dear Patrizia and Michelangelo, you
have come into the house of the Lord,

26:07.800 --> 26:11.358
in the presence of the Church’s
minister and the community,

26:11.360 --> 26:14.798
so your intention to enter into Marriage

26:14.800 --> 26:17.240
may be strengthened with a sacred seal.

26:31.370 --> 26:33.408
Excuse me.

26:33.410 --> 26:37.410
- Can you tell me where this office is?
- Down the end on the left.

26:56.730 --> 26:58.650
Come in.

27:02.290 --> 27:04.528
Good morning, I'm Alberto Resta.

27:04.530 --> 27:08.170
Please, come in.
Can you close the door?

27:15.290 --> 27:16.970
It's a pleasure.

27:22.890 --> 27:26.288
Why have I been called in?

27:26.290 --> 27:29.328
I just wanted to have
an informal chat with you.

27:29.330 --> 27:33.848
So, LT Solid, headquarters in Panama.

27:33.850 --> 27:38.450
CAD Industrial, Luxembourg,
and Sillow Connection, London.

27:39.650 --> 27:41.530
Do you know these companies?

27:43.770 --> 27:45.488
Of course, I work with them.

27:45.490 --> 27:47.930
- What work?
- I'm a consultant.

27:49.050 --> 27:51.768
I don't believe
there's anything illegal, is there?

27:51.770 --> 27:53.808
No, there isn't.

27:53.810 --> 27:57.008
There might be a couple of anomalies.

27:57.010 --> 27:58.650
And what would they be?

28:00.210 --> 28:02.568
These companies paid you
consultation fees

28:02.570 --> 28:06.528
just in time to cover your exposure
with the bank.

28:06.530 --> 28:09.568
No, it's exactly the opposite.

28:09.570 --> 28:12.248
I had credits with these companies
for months

28:12.250 --> 28:16.290
and I pressed them for payment
when the bank came down on me.

28:21.330 --> 28:23.890
The second anomaly?

28:26.210 --> 28:28.568
That they chose as a consultant

28:28.570 --> 28:32.130
a businessman who without
murky capital would have failed.

28:35.010 --> 28:39.570
I don't think I understand
what you're talking about.

28:53.570 --> 28:57.250
Now, if our chat's over, I'd like to go.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.128
Please, go.

29:01.130 --> 29:05.850
I hope that after all these debts
you've learned to handle the tension.

29:16.730 --> 29:18.210
Goodbye.

29:20.210 --> 29:21.730
Is it good?

29:30.450 --> 29:31.850
Well?

29:40.650 --> 29:42.770
Patrizia accepted.

29:44.810 --> 29:49.050
What else would she do?
You gave her this wedding present...

29:51.970 --> 29:55.808
From today, all our ties with
Secondigliano are severed.

29:55.810 --> 29:58.930
They just have to let us reopen
the worksite.

30:02.730 --> 30:07.170
- Tiziana is taking care of that.
- In the end, you were right...

30:08.770 --> 30:11.370
To fly, a plane needs to detach
from the ground.

30:16.210 --> 30:18.970
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

30:29.050 --> 30:30.528
Tiziana...

30:30.530 --> 30:33.648
All the funds transfers,
all the payments we've made,

30:33.650 --> 30:36.808
you verified them all, right?

30:36.810 --> 30:38.568
Of course.

30:38.570 --> 30:42.808
Is there any chance
something might look strange?

30:42.810 --> 30:44.730
Absolutely not. Why?

30:46.210 --> 30:50.770
- Are you sure? It's very important.
- Yes, I'm sure.

30:52.210 --> 30:55.050
Nothing looks strange
about the funds or the payments.

30:57.050 --> 31:01.168
I know exactly what we're doing.
And with whom.

31:01.170 --> 31:03.648
You hired me because
I'm competent, didn't you?

31:03.650 --> 31:07.650
Do you think I'd let anything strange
show up and risk everything?

31:16.130 --> 31:18.610
But now you have to tell me
what's going on.

31:23.890 --> 31:26.850
I'll tell you, but it has
to stay between you and me.

32:11.050 --> 32:14.410
Hi, Tiziana. Well?

32:19.450 --> 32:22.410
Alberto was summoned
to the prosecutor's office.

32:28.170 --> 32:30.570
They asked him to name you.

32:32.010 --> 32:34.170
But he held out, he protected you.

32:35.650 --> 32:38.370
He wanted me to reassure him
about the accounts.

32:47.210 --> 32:49.330
Maybe you know Alberto better than me.

33:01.450 --> 33:03.690
But now I want you to tell me something.

33:05.810 --> 33:08.570
Do you think he'll hold out
the next time, too?

33:49.170 --> 33:52.890
It's beautiful, Gennaro.
It's really beautiful.

33:56.370 --> 33:58.010
I'm glad you like it.

33:59.330 --> 34:01.290
Do you wanna tell me why we're here?

34:16.449 --> 34:18.449
What are you thinking?

34:28.650 --> 34:31.969
I'm thinking about those
who gave their lives to get us here.

35:11.290 --> 35:14.770
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- It's beautiful.

35:16.890 --> 35:20.570
If we buy it, I have connections
in City Hall for the restoration.

35:22.250 --> 35:24.770
The price you told me is favorable.

35:39.770 --> 35:41.650
You know, I had a friend...

35:43.090 --> 35:45.330
a brother.

35:47.770 --> 35:52.770
I look at the sea and think that he's
there, somewhere, watching me.

36:00.890 --> 36:03.450
Anything you want to tell me, Alberto?

36:07.050 --> 36:10.610
- No.
- Are you sure?

36:12.610 --> 36:14.610
Yes.

36:18.130 --> 36:20.250
All good, then.

36:23.370 --> 36:25.010
What is it, Gennaro?

36:26.850 --> 36:28.810
Don't you trust me anymore?

36:30.690 --> 36:33.970
Alberto, you know, I don't trust anyone.

36:35.330 --> 36:37.530
But we're good.

36:55.010 --> 37:00.770
- So, do we buy this place or not?
- Of course! Of course we'll buy it.

37:01.850 --> 37:03.810
Then let's buy it.

37:04.810 --> 37:06.490
Let's go.

37:40.250 --> 37:42.370
- See you, Gennaro.
- See you, Alberto.

39:12.890 --> 39:14.530
Fuck!

39:38.897 --> 39:43.897
