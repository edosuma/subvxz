[upbeat music]

00:10.208 --> 00:12.709
- Uh, hey, guys,

00:10.208 --> 00:12.709
I got our sleeping bags.

00:12.750 --> 00:13.959
Little help?

00:14.834 --> 00:16.291
- Yes!

00:24.083 --> 00:26.750
Oh, you're done, perfect.

00:26.792 --> 00:29.542
Now we can practice for our

00:26.792 --> 00:29.542
sleepover at the history museum.

00:29.583 --> 00:31.083
- Practice sleeping?

00:31.125 --> 00:33.917
I can do that

00:31.125 --> 00:33.917
with my eyes closed.

00:35.458 --> 00:38.208
- No, practice not sleeping.

00:38.250 --> 00:40.667
This is finally our year

00:38.250 --> 00:40.667
to go on the big class trip,

00:40.709 --> 00:42.667
and something epic

00:40.709 --> 00:42.667
always happens,

00:42.709 --> 00:44.333
and if it happens

00:42.709 --> 00:44.333
in the middle of the night,

00:44.375 --> 00:46.709
I want to be awake so I can say,

00:46.750 --> 00:48.667
"I was there when..."

00:48.709 --> 00:50.875
- When what?

00:48.709 --> 00:50.875
- It's a saying.

00:50.917 --> 00:54.250
- That says what?

00:50.917 --> 00:54.250
- That says we saw the epic

00:50.917 --> 00:54.250
moment that became the stuff of

00:50.917 --> 00:54.250
legend.

00:54.291 --> 00:56.000
- When?

00:56.041 --> 00:58.375
- It hasn't happened yet.

00:56.041 --> 00:58.375
- Then how did we see it?

00:58.417 --> 01:00.417
- We didn't,

00:58.417 --> 01:00.417
but we're hoping to be there

01:00.458 --> 01:02.333
when it happens.

01:00.458 --> 01:02.333
- When what happens?

01:02.375 --> 01:04.750
together: The epic moment!

01:04.792 --> 01:06.875
- Like the year Nate Powell

01:04.792 --> 01:06.875
got his pajamas stuck

01:06.917 --> 01:08.250
on the saber tooth tiger--

01:08.291 --> 01:12.375
oh, and pantsed himself

01:08.291 --> 01:12.375
in front of everyone.

01:12.417 --> 01:14.125
- Hey, I wonder

01:12.417 --> 01:14.125
what's gonna happen this year.

01:14.166 --> 01:16.250
- Oscar's always

01:14.166 --> 01:16.250
sticking his head in stuff.

01:16.291 --> 01:18.667
Maybe he'll get it stuck

01:16.291 --> 01:18.667
in something at the museum.

01:18.709 --> 01:22.291
- Now why would you go

01:18.709 --> 01:22.291
and stick your head in that?

01:22.333 --> 01:23.792
- I just wanted

01:22.333 --> 01:23.792
to see if it would fit.

01:23.834 --> 01:26.792
[all laugh]

01:26.834 --> 01:28.959
- That would be epic,

01:29.000 --> 01:31.917
but nobody really

01:29.000 --> 01:31.917
gets their head caught in stuff.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.166
- Uh, guys?

01:36.709 --> 01:37.917
Dicky.

01:37.959 --> 01:39.625
- I just wanted

01:37.959 --> 01:39.625
to see if it would fit.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.208
- Turn your head the other way.

01:45.834 --> 01:47.542
- Whoa.

01:49.500 --> 01:52.291
- Well, time to not

01:49.500 --> 01:52.291
get to sleep.

01:52.333 --> 01:54.792
- Dawn, we're just

01:52.333 --> 01:54.792
as excited as you are,

01:54.834 --> 01:57.667
but don't you think it's better

01:54.834 --> 01:57.667
to get as much rest as possible

01:57.709 --> 01:59.542
before we go?

01:57.709 --> 01:59.542
- He has a point.

01:59.583 --> 02:02.417
Shouldn't you be doing the exact

01:59.583 --> 02:02.417
opposite of what your plan is?

02:02.458 --> 02:05.875
- Even I see the value

02:02.458 --> 02:05.875
in a good night's sleep.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.834
- You play like you train,

02:07.875 --> 02:09.583
and you don't train

02:07.875 --> 02:09.583
for a marathon

02:09.625 --> 02:10.834
by sitting in a chair.

02:09.625 --> 02:10.834
- I would.

02:10.875 --> 02:13.208
- Sounds smart.

02:10.875 --> 02:13.208
- I'm training right now.

02:15.041 --> 02:17.041
- Fine, don't stay up,

02:17.083 --> 02:20.041
but if this epic moment happens

02:17.083 --> 02:20.041
while you guys are all asleep,

02:20.083 --> 02:21.625
I'm not waking you.

02:21.667 --> 02:23.583
- All right,

02:21.667 --> 02:23.583
we'll stay up all night.

02:23.625 --> 02:24.834

02:45.500 --> 02:47.041
stayed up all night

02:47.083 --> 02:48.750
and got yourself sick.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.750

02:48.792 --> 02:50.208
there's no way Mom and Dad

02:50.250 --> 02:52.000
will let you go on the trip.

02:52.041 --> 02:54.625
- Oh, please.

07:18.375 --> 07:20.417
Aw, here comes the hugger.

are going

07:23.667 --> 07:26.291
on their big overnight trip.

07:26.333 --> 07:27.959
her A-game.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.166
- Yeah.

This is a hug.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.125
Mm.

07:41.166 --> 07:43.250
Oh, you feel warm.

07:43.291 --> 07:44.500
You're not getting sick,

07:43.291 --> 07:44.500
are you?

07:44.542 --> 07:46.000
- No.

07:46.041 --> 07:47.959
- You sound a little congested.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.166
- I'm fine.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.166
Ugh, Dicky.

07:50.208 --> 07:53.333
- Okay, you know, there is

07:50.208 --> 07:53.333
a nasty bug going around.

07:53.375 --> 07:54.959
I better take your temperature.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.208
Here.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.208
- [mumbles]

07:56.250 --> 07:57.625
- You had that in your pocket?

07:57.667 --> 07:59.166
- Yeah, that's why it's called

07:59.208 --> 08:02.041
a ther-mom-eter.

07:59.208 --> 08:02.041
[chuckles]

08:02.083 --> 08:04.917
check Dicky's overnight bag.

08:04.959 --> 08:07.000
He could have forgotten

08:04.959 --> 08:07.000
his underwear.

08:07.041 --> 08:08.500
- Or he could have packed

08:07.041 --> 08:08.500
only underwear.

08:08.542 --> 08:10.500
- You never know

08:08.542 --> 08:10.500
which way this guy's gonna go.

08:10.542 --> 08:12.583
- You're right.

08:12.625 --> 08:14.375
- What do we do?

08:14.417 --> 08:16.542
- Put that in your mouth.

08:14.417 --> 08:16.542
- No, I'm not getting sick.

08:16.583 --> 08:19.041

about this trip

since first grade.

there's a contest to guess

who the epic moment

There's a lot of places

09:14.125 --> 09:17.250
he could stick his head.

09:21.250 --> 09:22.583
- I went with Mae and Molly.

09:22.625 --> 09:24.291
They've been having

09:22.625 --> 09:24.291
some drama lately.

- But do you see me complaining?

14:10.291 --> 14:13.917
No, and why?

14:13.959 --> 14:17.166
- Because you don't have

14:13.959 --> 14:17.166

- Okay, everybody,

14:13.959 --> 14:17.166
stop answering me.

14:47.333 --> 14:49.625
Principal Tarian.

14:49.667 --> 14:52.583
- All right, who's the sneezer?

14:52.625 --> 14:54.875
- I didn't hear anything.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.875
- I'm pretty sure it's

14:54.917 --> 14:56.583
the guy covered in tissues.

14:56.625 --> 14:58.166
- I distinctly heard

14:56.625 --> 14:58.166

That was just us

Let's go catch up

16:02.959 --> 16:06.500
with the group.

16:06.542 --> 16:10.041
- Wait, where'd the door go?

16:06.542 --> 16:10.041
- It was right here.

16:10.083 --> 16:11.875
- There's gonna be

16:10.083 --> 16:11.875
a doorknob here somewhere.

16:11.917 --> 16:14.291
- There better be.

16:11.917 --> 16:14.291
Otherwise we're trapped in here.

16:14.333 --> 16:15.583
- Okay, hold on.

16:15.625 --> 16:18.542
I'll just call Mae

16:15.625 --> 16:18.542
to come let us out.

16:18.583 --> 16:21.750
If I had any signal.

16:18.583 --> 16:21.750
- Of course, there's no signal.

16:21.792 --> 16:25.000
We're in caveman times.

16:25.041 --> 16:27.291

Whoa.

Those are real rocks.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.291

After all we've done

16:41.333 --> 16:42.667
to get here,

happened if we'd just

16:45.417 --> 16:46.959
admitted we were sick

16:47.000 --> 16:48.750
and let Principal Tarian

16:47.000 --> 16:48.750
"gone" us.

16:48.792 --> 16:50.417
- No, none of this

16:50.458 --> 16:52.542
if Dawn didn't get us all sick.

- Well, somebody needs

16:57.959 --> 17:00.291
to be blamed!

17:00.333 --> 17:01.959
- Then I blame you!

17:00.333 --> 17:01.959
- And I blame you!
