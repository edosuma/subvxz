00:01.619 --> 00:02.885
- Do you think David's bought
himself a cutting board

00:02.887 --> 00:04.386
for the new house?

00:04.388 --> 00:06.822
- No, I can't imagine your
brother's ever carved meat.

00:06.824 --> 00:08.424
- And if he has, it was
probably on the back

00:08.426 --> 00:10.325
of an old DVD of Highlander.

00:10.327 --> 00:11.994
I'm gonna get him one
for his housewarming.

00:11.996 --> 00:13.462
- That's a nice gift.

00:13.464 --> 00:16.098
- I am very curious to see
what this brunch he's throwing

00:16.100 --> 00:17.299
is gonna look like.

00:17.301 --> 00:19.435
- Do you think there'll
be chairs or forks?

00:19.437 --> 00:20.636
- I do not.

00:20.638 --> 00:22.738
- Hey, where's
that bag of sugar?

00:22.740 --> 00:24.139
- Up your butt.

00:24.141 --> 00:26.241
- Okay, nope it's not there.

00:26.243 --> 00:27.976
- Well, you didn't
really check, so--

00:27.978 --> 00:29.645
- Yeah I did, it's not there.

00:29.647 --> 00:32.114
- Okay, if I look up your
butt and it's in there,

00:32.116 --> 00:33.115
I'm not gonna be happy.

00:33.117 --> 00:33.816
- Okay, go ahead
and take a look.

00:33.818 --> 00:34.850
- Great, I will.

00:34.852 --> 00:36.185
- Hey, stop it.

00:36.187 --> 00:37.319
- I'm checkin' it out.
- No.

00:37.321 --> 00:38.954
Hey, stop it.

00:38.956 --> 00:41.724
- You know that you can't
play chicken with me.

00:41.726 --> 00:45.060
It will always end with my
fingers in your butt hole.

00:45.062 --> 00:46.462
- Well, aren't you
the loser then?

00:46.464 --> 00:47.830
- I don't know, let's see.
- Hey, stop it.

00:47.832 --> 00:48.831
I don't feel safe.

00:48.833 --> 00:50.699
Stop, step away.

00:52.169 --> 00:55.971
- Alright, but eventually,
you will have to bend over,

00:55.973 --> 00:58.240
and I will be waiting.

00:59.443 --> 01:02.111
Siri, set a reminder
to get Mike's butt.

01:02.113 --> 01:04.279
- [Siri] Okay,
setting a reminder.

01:04.281 --> 01:06.181
- Oh my God.
- Sorry it's in the cloud now,

01:06.183 --> 01:08.684
there's nothin' I can do, bro.

01:08.686 --> 01:10.719
You're not gonna
sleep for a week.

01:10.721 --> 01:13.288
(upbeat music)

01:29.874 --> 01:32.007
- I feel like I've been trapped
in one long birthday party

01:32.009 --> 01:34.009
for three years.

01:34.011 --> 01:36.111
- I'm just worried that
princess mermaid's gonna be late

01:36.113 --> 01:37.513
to her live cam show.

01:37.515 --> 01:38.447
- [Lady On Left] I'd watch that.

01:38.449 --> 01:40.115
- I'd throw my eyes across it.

01:40.117 --> 01:43.352
Why do they all have to look
kind of like prostitutes?

01:43.354 --> 01:44.386
- What do you mean?

01:44.388 --> 01:46.021
Who else would do this job?

01:46.023 --> 01:48.557
- Look, if you ever wanna go
to a game, I'll hook it up.

01:48.559 --> 01:50.359
- Great, I will, awesome.
- You bet.

01:51.262 --> 01:52.795
- Hi.

01:52.797 --> 01:54.997
- Okay, you're gonna need to
put your Rich Ison boner away,

01:54.999 --> 01:56.231
it is scaring the kids.

01:56.233 --> 01:57.432
Come on, cover it up.

01:58.536 --> 01:59.368
Eww.

02:00.538 --> 02:02.404
Mike, be honest, is this
why you had children?

02:02.406 --> 02:04.273
- Oh, in hopes that one day
my daughter would go to school

02:04.275 --> 02:05.207
with Rich Ison's kid?

02:05.209 --> 02:06.708
- Uh huh.
- Yeah, it is.

02:06.710 --> 02:10.078
- Don't take an aggressive
bite of a carrot after that.

02:10.080 --> 02:12.080
I'm so sorry that you
had to witness this.

02:12.082 --> 02:13.582
He's gloating.
- Hey, guys.

02:13.584 --> 02:15.450
Make sure you get your
gift bags before you go.

02:15.452 --> 02:16.752
It's a fish.

02:17.922 --> 02:19.488
- They're giving out
gift bags of fish?

02:19.490 --> 02:20.823
- Oh yeah.

02:20.825 --> 02:22.124
- I'm not leavin'
here with a fish.

02:22.126 --> 02:22.958
- Nobody wants a fish.

02:22.960 --> 02:24.193
- You know what?

02:24.195 --> 02:25.394
I'm not getting a fish,
you wanna grab Amelia?

02:25.396 --> 02:26.595
- Yes I do.

02:26.597 --> 02:28.864
- Hey, Izzy, before
Sophie and Amelia leave,

02:28.866 --> 02:31.033
make sure you show
them your fish.

02:31.035 --> 02:34.503
They won't want to go
without their bags of fish.

02:34.505 --> 02:35.904
- Thank you so much, Brian.

02:35.906 --> 02:38.540
- How dare you use your
child in this manner.

02:38.542 --> 02:40.008
You know what, Izzy?

02:40.010 --> 02:42.911
We're actually gonna pass,
but yours is so cute.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.146
- Hello.
- Wow, that was fast.

02:44.148 --> 02:47.249
Perfect, okay guys,
see you on Monday.

02:47.251 --> 02:49.651
I will pick you up one
of those little divers.

02:49.653 --> 02:50.886
- Oh no.

02:50.888 --> 02:52.254
- You know what, and
a treasure chest.

02:52.256 --> 02:53.288
- I'm good, thank you so much.
- A little diver.

02:53.290 --> 02:54.656
- But I'm not getting a fish.

02:54.658 --> 02:55.524
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thank you so much.

02:55.526 --> 02:56.825
- Love you guys.
- Bye.

02:56.827 --> 02:58.093
- Bye bye.
- A fish is not happening.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.494
- Hey, Bubs, that seems
like a fun party, right?

02:59.496 --> 03:00.696
- Hold up.

03:00.698 --> 03:03.465
Hey, Amelia, don't
forget your gift bag.

03:04.401 --> 03:06.869
- Mommy, look, a fish.

03:06.871 --> 03:09.972
- Wow, thank you so much.

03:09.974 --> 03:11.173
- You're welcome, enjoy.

03:13.110 --> 03:13.942
- Shit.

03:17.147 --> 03:18.814
Rich Ison can really move.

03:18.816 --> 03:21.984
He got from his pool to
us at an alarming speed.

03:21.986 --> 03:24.019
- Yeah, he's got great burst.

03:24.021 --> 03:27.055
- Good luck trying to assault
him in a dark alley, Mike.

03:27.057 --> 03:28.423
- I can't make promises.

03:28.425 --> 03:31.093
- I feel like this is
a promise you can make.

03:31.095 --> 03:32.628
- No.

03:32.630 --> 03:34.396
- Ah, I'm gonna have to work
with Rob a little bit today.

03:34.398 --> 03:36.398
- Does Kyle ever feel
cheated now that you have

03:36.400 --> 03:37.399
a new writing boyfriend?

03:37.401 --> 03:39.668
- I mean, I sure
as shit hope so.

03:39.670 --> 03:41.436
Otherwise, what am I doing here?

03:41.438 --> 03:44.506
I will say, I'm starting
to understand the allure

03:44.508 --> 03:46.441
of the open relationship.

03:46.443 --> 03:47.943
- Really?

03:47.945 --> 03:50.445
- Yeah, you know, makes
you feel desirable again,

03:50.447 --> 03:52.080
get your body tingling.

03:52.082 --> 03:54.917
I think studios pick
up on that hotness.

03:54.919 --> 03:56.451
- Probably.

03:56.453 --> 03:58.754
- Don't worry, you'll see it
this weekend at Todd's party.

03:58.756 --> 04:01.290
- I think I'm gonna let
you go solo to that one.

04:01.292 --> 04:02.524
- What, why?

04:02.526 --> 04:05.060
- You know, I don't--

04:06.530 --> 04:08.363
- Now I kinda wanna go solo
if you're gonna be doing

04:08.365 --> 04:10.198
that face.
- Good, oh good good.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.734
No, I just, I don't know
if I'm up for a whole night

04:12.736 --> 04:14.236
of comedy bits
with your friends.

04:14.238 --> 04:17.072
They never end and they
just get more horrifying.

04:17.074 --> 04:19.408
- I know, that's how we
maintain our adorable state

04:19.410 --> 04:20.709
of arrested development.

04:20.711 --> 04:24.012
- So adorable.
- Right, everyone loves it.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.882
- I know you like purple,
my walls are lavender.

04:26.884 --> 04:28.150
- Who are you talking too, Bubs?

04:28.152 --> 04:29.785
- Barbara.

04:29.787 --> 04:31.420
- You named your fish Barbara?

04:31.422 --> 04:33.388
Does she simmer in Boca?

04:33.390 --> 04:35.557
- Her name's Barbara T Warren.

04:35.559 --> 04:37.359
The T stands for toys.

04:37.361 --> 04:39.761
- Oh, of course it does.

04:39.763 --> 04:41.263
- I'm Barbara's big sister.

04:41.265 --> 04:43.165
She's gonna sleep in my room.

04:43.167 --> 04:44.099
We're best friends.

04:45.302 --> 04:47.970
(water gurgles)

04:47.972 --> 04:50.238
- Oh, Bubs, I'm so sorry.

04:50.240 --> 04:54.409
- I loved Barbara, she
was my best friend.

04:54.411 --> 04:57.612
- I know, she was a very
cool fish, and that was such

04:57.614 --> 05:02.317
a special two and 1/2 hours
that you guys spent together.

05:02.319 --> 05:05.487
- Why did we have to put
Barbara in the toilet?

05:05.489 --> 05:09.458
- Well, we thought that because
she's a fish that she would

05:09.460 --> 05:10.993
like the water part.

05:10.995 --> 05:13.795
- And so, you know what, it
seemed like a perfect place

05:13.797 --> 05:16.431
for her final moments.

05:16.433 --> 05:18.166
- But our poop
goes in the toilet.

05:19.636 --> 05:21.870
- The toilet knows
the difference
between fish and poop.

05:21.872 --> 05:24.072
- Does the toilet send
Barbara to heaven?

05:25.709 --> 05:29.511
- Uh, possibly.

05:29.513 --> 05:33.715
Or, you know what, maybe it
goes to the ocean where there,

05:33.717 --> 05:36.418
another bigger fish
can eat her and then

05:36.420 --> 05:39.688
become a super big strong fish.

05:39.690 --> 05:41.289
- I don't want her to get eaten.

05:41.291 --> 05:42.624
I want her to go to heaven.

05:42.626 --> 05:44.793
- I know you do,
lovey, I'm sorry.

05:44.795 --> 05:46.962
- Why did Barbara have to die?

05:46.964 --> 05:49.564
- Well, it was just, you know,

05:49.566 --> 05:52.601
everything has to go sometime.

05:52.603 --> 05:54.603
- Yeah, and I guess it
was just Barbara's time.

05:54.605 --> 05:58.073
- Wait, so you and
Mommy are gonna die?

05:58.075 --> 06:02.644
- Well, eventually,
yes, but I mean,

06:02.646 --> 06:04.946
not until we are very old.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.048
- How old?

06:06.050 --> 06:08.450
- So so so so old.

06:08.452 --> 06:10.218
Daddy and I are
not going anywhere.

06:10.220 --> 06:12.020
- No.
- Alright, I am

06:12.022 --> 06:15.257
gonna go jump some rope.

06:15.259 --> 06:17.959
So I don't know if there's
anyone in here that's interested

06:17.961 --> 06:21.129
in anything like that,
honey, kinda looking at you.

06:21.131 --> 06:22.330
- I want to.

06:22.332 --> 06:23.765
- Alright, well, I
guess she's in, sorry.

06:23.767 --> 06:25.967
- Okay, go grab the rope.
- Okay.

06:28.305 --> 06:29.604
- (bleep) Rich Ison.

06:31.775 --> 06:34.443
(uptempo music)

06:37.514 --> 06:39.815
- So do you feel like a
thousand years old now that

06:39.817 --> 06:41.817
your younger brother
is a home owner?

06:41.819 --> 06:45.554
- No, I am thrilled because you
owe me for years of hosting.

06:45.556 --> 06:48.190
I will bring ice
on Sunday, David.

06:48.192 --> 06:49.758
Enjoy your new house.

06:49.760 --> 06:51.760
- I don't care for
you particularly.

06:51.762 --> 06:52.994
- Actually, I don't
think that's true.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.663
I think you care
for me immensely.

06:54.665 --> 06:58.633
I think it makes you
uncomfortable how
much you love me.

06:58.635 --> 06:59.468
- Mommy?

06:59.470 --> 07:00.936
That man is old, right?

07:03.774 --> 07:05.006
- Yeah, I guess.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.975
Here, why don't you pick
out some green apples.

07:06.977 --> 07:08.710
- I'm not serving apples.

07:08.712 --> 07:10.846
- Alright, I was
talking to Amelia.

07:10.848 --> 07:12.614
In all seriousness, I
know you have no idea

07:12.616 --> 07:13.548
what you're doing.

07:13.550 --> 07:14.516
Do you need some help on Sunday?

07:14.518 --> 07:16.184
- Mommy, he's really old.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.886
He's gonna die soon, right?

07:20.023 --> 07:20.956
- I gotta go.

07:20.958 --> 07:21.890
- [Todd] Wait, what is happ--

07:21.892 --> 07:23.458
- Right, Mommy, he's gonna die.

07:25.095 --> 07:26.595
- Well, you know what, yes.

07:26.597 --> 07:31.600
He is older and older
people die sooner,

07:32.769 --> 07:35.303
so yes, he probably
will die soon'ish.

07:37.374 --> 07:38.907
- That's what I thought.

07:38.909 --> 07:40.442
- Okay, you know what, let's
head to the freezer section.

07:40.444 --> 07:41.676
- But I want apples.

07:41.678 --> 07:42.377
- I don't think the
apples are so thrilled

07:43.013 --> 07:44.746
with us right now.

07:44.748 --> 07:45.747
Sorry.

07:51.338 --> 07:53.905
Okay, wait, so
everyone's fish died?

07:53.907 --> 07:55.807
- The kids are devastated.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.343
- Oh my God, I can't believe
an entire kindergarten class

07:58.345 --> 08:00.645
is having to confront the
concept of death because

08:00.647 --> 08:02.881
of Rich Ison's
shit party favors.

08:02.883 --> 08:05.450
- Yeah, after drop off, I'm
gonna go pick up our new cat

08:05.452 --> 08:06.718
from the shelter.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.354
- Oh my God, you have to
now get an actual animal

08:09.356 --> 08:10.555
in your home?

08:10.557 --> 08:11.489
- Well, I have to
make up for the death

08:11.491 --> 08:13.158
of our first pet, Andrea.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.092
- Oh.
- Oh.

08:14.094 --> 08:14.926
- Did your fish get a name?

08:14.928 --> 08:15.760
- Oh, you mean Barbara?

08:15.762 --> 08:17.562
Is that who you meant?

08:17.564 --> 08:19.831
- Oh, I didn't know that I
was referring to Barbara,

08:19.833 --> 08:21.333
- Yeah.
- But yeah, Barbara.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.969
- She used to run a hair
salon out in Thousand Oaks

08:23.971 --> 08:26.104
- Oh no.
- before she came to us.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.240
- How are people gonna get
their, you know, perms?

08:28.242 --> 08:31.543
- A lot of angry frizzy-haired
people out in the Valley.

08:31.545 --> 08:35.714
- Not only did ours get a name,
but Grenadine was laid out,

08:35.716 --> 08:38.617
and what seemed like 200
beanie boos showed up

08:38.619 --> 08:39.885
to pay their respects.

08:39.887 --> 08:41.386
- Oh, yeah, we had
a lot of very sad,

08:41.388 --> 08:43.622
and very long-winded
Jedi knights.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.190
- You know what, it's
actually a little touching

08:45.192 --> 08:47.259
that Jedi knights would sort of

08:47.261 --> 08:48.560
be this emotional.
- Yeah, be there.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.095
- Yeah, well they
have the Force.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.130
- Not the force to
keep that fish alive.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.965
- We all had a tough weekend.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.433
- You know what, Brian?

08:55.435 --> 08:58.003
At least you guys are Catholic,
because Grenadine's up there

08:58.005 --> 08:59.604
livin' the life in heaven.

08:59.606 --> 09:02.107
Poor Barbara's being
digested by a monkfish.

09:02.109 --> 09:04.209
That's how I left
it with Amelia.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.511
- It's very Biblical, you
know, Jonah and the whale,

09:06.513 --> 09:07.746
et cetera, et cetera.

09:07.748 --> 09:08.880
- I thought you
weren't religious.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.749
- I'm not, but I read the Bible.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.617
I wanna know what you
weirdos are talkin' about.

09:12.619 --> 09:14.119
- Good morning.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.820
So we heard what happened this
weekend, and we just wanted

09:15.822 --> 09:18.189
to let you know we put some
time aside for the kids to talk

09:18.191 --> 09:19.424
about their feelings.

09:19.426 --> 09:20.659
- Oh, okay.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.427
- Thanks for letting us know.
- Of course.

09:25.599 --> 09:27.432
- They have to change up
their whole lesson plan now

09:27.434 --> 09:28.266
because of this?

09:28.268 --> 09:29.701
- (bleep) Rich Ison.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.572
- How is that mustache my
daughter's kindergarten teacher?

09:37.444 --> 09:38.743
- Hey, are you
getting Brad anything

09:38.745 --> 09:40.278
for his birthday Saturday?

09:40.280 --> 09:43.148
- No, I'm not in love with him.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.950
- Wait a minute, you got me
something for my birthday.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.284
- Yeah, 'cause I'm
obsessed with you.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.086
- Ooh.
- Barf.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.587
- Hey.
- Hey guys.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.855
What's up, what can I get you?

09:50.857 --> 09:53.191
- Hi Amy, can I get a
vanilla latte please.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.025
- Americano please.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.360
- Got it, that's $7.50.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.661
- Do you have cash?

09:56.663 --> 09:58.163
- Uh, yeah, it's up your butt.

09:58.165 --> 10:01.366
- Oh, um, my hands are full,
do you mind gettin' it for me?

10:01.368 --> 10:02.801
- No I do not, take
your pants off,

10:02.803 --> 10:04.169
I'll three-knuckle ya up there.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.804
- Oh really, all three
knuckles, right up my butt hole?

10:05.806 --> 10:07.872
- I could for four,
I'll get up in there.

10:07.874 --> 10:09.374
- Sure, yeah, I'll
take my pants off.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.142
- Um, actually, you can't take
your pants off here, sorry.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.277
- We could go in the bathroom.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.745
- Let's get in the bathroom.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.080
I just need the time and space
because I will be getting

10:15.082 --> 10:16.314
very deep up there.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.849
- Oh no, I know your
technique, obviously,

10:17.851 --> 10:19.150
you wanna get right in there

10:19.152 --> 10:20.085
and expand
- And I will be

10:20.087 --> 10:21.019
spreading my fingers.

10:21.021 --> 10:21.953
- Oh, of course.
- I'm sorry.

10:21.955 --> 10:22.721
I just wanted to get a muffin.

10:23.690 --> 10:25.457
- Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.794
Obviously, go ahead please,
I will pay for your muffin,

10:30.797 --> 10:33.665
and our coffees, Amy, sorry.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.771
- Night, tootsie roll.

10:39.773 --> 10:42.073
- Goodnight, smooch de la rooch.

10:42.075 --> 10:43.842
See ya in the morns, corns.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.310
(gives kisses)

10:45.312 --> 10:47.512
God, it's really disgusting
how this kid doesn't

10:47.514 --> 10:48.580
get any love.

10:48.582 --> 10:50.081
- So sad.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.450
- Mommy, what's gonna happen
to me when you and Daddy die?

10:53.854 --> 10:57.822
- Aw, Bubs, again, you don't
really need to worry about that

10:57.824 --> 11:01.126
until we're so old, and by
then, you're gonna be a grown up

11:01.128 --> 11:03.595
and you're gonna be
like, I don't even need

11:03.597 --> 11:05.296
those two anymore.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.332
- Not everyone dies
when they're old.

11:07.334 --> 11:11.603
Toby's aunt died when she was
23 from eating too much sugar.

11:13.006 --> 11:16.274
- Yeah, I'd love some more
details on that story.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.009
- Will I go live with Grammy?

11:19.212 --> 11:23.448
- No, I mean, probably
not, because you know,

11:23.450 --> 11:28.453
Grammy's getting a
little older, and so--

11:29.322 --> 11:30.188
- So she's gonna die soon.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.758
- No, Grammy is
not going anywhere.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.894
Everybody is fine,
nobody's dying.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.128
- This is fun.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.030
- But she's gonna die
before you, right?

11:40.400 --> 11:44.069
- Well, yes, most likely because

11:44.071 --> 11:46.805
that's the way

11:46.807 --> 11:48.473
the generations go.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.042
- Who am I gonna live with then?

11:52.345 --> 11:53.912
- Well, you wanna know?

11:53.914 --> 11:56.815
Again, this only
happens in an emergency,

11:56.817 --> 11:59.684
but Daddy and I have discussed
it and you would go live

11:59.686 --> 12:00.985
with Uncle David.

12:00.987 --> 12:01.820
- Really?

12:03.256 --> 12:08.093
- Again, this only happens
if Daddy and I are gone.

12:08.095 --> 12:08.927
- Okay, great.

12:10.030 --> 12:10.895
- Wow.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.365
- Don't look at me, I've
been dead for years.

12:17.270 --> 12:20.805
- Well, our daughter's
going to be fine if we die.

12:20.807 --> 12:22.240
- What?
- Yeah.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.709
I might even say she's
giddy with the possibility.

12:24.711 --> 12:27.345
When I told her that she would
go live with Uncle David,

12:27.347 --> 12:30.482
her eyes literally lit up
with the idea of a future

12:30.484 --> 12:32.317
she didn't even
know was possible.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.251
- Come on.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.486
- Oh, no no, I was there.

12:34.488 --> 12:36.221
That's when she just
breezed past my death.

12:36.223 --> 12:37.722
- Just right past.

12:37.724 --> 12:39.257
- Well, I guess we should
be sort of relieved, I mean,

12:39.259 --> 12:40.925
we want her to be
comfortable with who she

12:40.927 --> 12:42.460
ends up with, right?

12:42.462 --> 12:44.796
- I know, I think this is just
like her little subconscious

12:44.798 --> 12:46.898
giving her a coping
mechanism in case

12:46.900 --> 12:48.566
something terrible happens.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.535
Breaks my heart to think
she's walking around

12:50.537 --> 12:51.903
worried about this.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.404
- Yeah, me too.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.540
- Mom, what did you tell me
about death when I was little?

12:55.542 --> 12:58.343
Do you remember how sad I
was when Candy Purple died?

12:58.345 --> 12:59.644
- I remember how sad our cat was

12:59.646 --> 13:01.045
when you named her Candy Purple.

13:01.047 --> 13:03.581
- Ooh, cool burn, Mom,

13:04.451 --> 13:06.017
cha cha cha.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.453
- Well, I just said
that she got super tired

13:08.455 --> 13:09.954
and then she fell asleep.

13:09.956 --> 13:14.859
- So you equated sleeping
with dying, to a child?

13:16.062 --> 13:16.995
Oh, that's weird,
that's around when

13:16.997 --> 13:18.463
my crippling insomnia started.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.964
I'm sure totally unrelated.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.300
- Well, there's just no
easy way to explain death

13:22.302 --> 13:23.134
to a child.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.636
- No, there isn't.

13:24.638 --> 13:27.205
By the way, I'm gonna need
you to give me all your

13:27.207 --> 13:29.674
end of life directives, 'cause
you're not gonna want me

13:29.676 --> 13:31.409
out there goin' rogue.

13:31.411 --> 13:34.145
- I don't care what you do
with my body after I die.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.613
- Really, is that a promise?

13:35.615 --> 13:37.682
- But if I ever go into
a coma, don't you dare

13:37.684 --> 13:38.950
pull the plug.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.985
- Even if you're like
totally unresponsive,

13:40.987 --> 13:43.955
you just wanna lie there
hooked up to machines,

13:43.957 --> 13:45.657
unable to communicate
with anyone?

13:45.659 --> 13:47.692
- Well, haven't you ever heard
about those people who go

13:47.694 --> 13:50.461
into a coma for like 30
years and then suddenly

13:50.463 --> 13:51.930
they wake up?

13:51.932 --> 13:54.065
- Sharon, how long do you
think you would end up living?

13:54.067 --> 13:55.833
- I don't know, 15 or 20 years.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.535
- This plan sounds flawless.

13:57.537 --> 14:00.505
Just so you know, I have
given Mike full license

14:00.507 --> 14:03.141
to end my life immediately,
as soon as I need a plug,

14:03.143 --> 14:04.008
I want it pulled.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.543
- Oh stop it.

14:05.545 --> 14:09.480
- What, I have no interest in
lying there, alive but trapped

14:09.482 --> 14:11.216
in my body with
just my thoughts.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.685
- Well, your thoughts,
then I can understand.

14:13.687 --> 14:16.921
- Woo, two in one, oh.

14:16.923 --> 14:18.923
- See ya tomorrow.

14:18.925 --> 14:19.824
- Bye, I'll be working on my
plans for when you're dead.

14:25.749 --> 14:28.516
(up tempo music)

14:31.354 --> 14:33.488
- Your mom wants to be
kept alive in a coma?

14:33.490 --> 14:35.623
- Yeah, and then
thinks she's gonna live

14:35.625 --> 14:37.325
another lifetime after that.

14:37.327 --> 14:39.160
- No no no no no, the only
thing that's gonna happen

14:39.162 --> 14:40.695
to your mom is that
she's gonna get fingered

14:40.697 --> 14:42.063
by all those male nurses.

14:42.065 --> 14:43.665
- Pretty sure that's
her motivation.

14:43.667 --> 14:46.000
- Oh really?
- You've met my mother.

14:46.002 --> 14:47.235
- Hey guys, aloha.

14:48.838 --> 14:51.072
- Oh, I don't know if all
of us have thanked you

14:51.074 --> 14:53.541
appropriately for inviting
us to the tropics.

14:53.543 --> 14:55.443
I mean, what you've done here--

14:55.445 --> 14:57.879
- If you're gonna go to Hawaii,
you (bleep) go to Hawaii.

14:57.881 --> 14:59.981
(everyone laughs)

14:59.983 --> 15:04.686
- Ahem, I've decided I'm
donating my body to a body farm.

15:04.688 --> 15:05.620
- Uh uh um.

15:06.723 --> 15:08.256
- I wanna make
sure you all heard.

15:08.258 --> 15:11.159
- No worry, we're not talking
about death for five minutes.

15:11.161 --> 15:13.328
- What the (bleep) is a body fa?

15:13.330 --> 15:14.829
- It's exactly what
it sounds like.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.731
- A body farm is one of
those farms where they

15:16.733 --> 15:18.933
grow delicious food in the
compost of human bodies.

15:18.935 --> 15:22.136
- No no no no, it's where
scientists study how

15:22.138 --> 15:24.072
different bodies decompose
in different environments

15:24.074 --> 15:25.306
for forensic purposes.

15:25.308 --> 15:27.108
- Oh, not at all what a
body farm sounds like.

15:27.110 --> 15:31.079
A body farm to me sounds
like people just like nude

15:31.081 --> 15:33.247
and tilling the lands.

15:33.249 --> 15:35.850
- Nude.
- Yeah, boy.

15:35.852 --> 15:36.851
- Yeah, boy, aloha.

15:36.853 --> 15:37.652
- No, no.

15:39.889 --> 15:42.190
- I don't know why people are
so freaked out about death.

15:42.192 --> 15:45.927
We're all gonna die, so let's
just like live with our fear.

15:45.929 --> 15:48.096
- Oh, did you just YOLO us, bro?

15:48.098 --> 15:49.497
- Yeah, yeah I did,
if you don't like it,

15:49.499 --> 15:51.132
you can suck my dick.

15:51.134 --> 15:52.667
- Well.
- It's actually

15:52.669 --> 15:55.036
interesting you bring that
up, because my new YOLO is

15:55.038 --> 15:56.604
I'm not leaving a party
'til I get my dick sucked.

15:56.606 --> 15:57.772
- Oh.
- Oh, I like that.

15:57.774 --> 15:59.007
That's sweet.

15:59.009 --> 16:01.242
Brad, you're closest
to Don, suck his dick.

16:01.244 --> 16:03.311
- That makes sense, sure, go
ahead and take your pants off.

16:03.313 --> 16:04.579
- Okay, fine, yeah.

16:04.581 --> 16:05.780
You know, I was actually
getting ready to leave,

16:05.782 --> 16:07.281
so this kind of
works out perfectly.

16:07.283 --> 16:08.483
- Yeah, we've been trying
to figure out how to get you

16:08.485 --> 16:09.717
outta here, so it's
kind of a twofer for us.

16:09.719 --> 16:11.419
- I will be honest, we
are ready for you to go,

16:11.421 --> 16:12.920
so pull out your D.

16:12.922 --> 16:14.455
- So I'm gonna take out my
dick, and then you're gonna

16:14.457 --> 16:17.225
put it in your mouth, and
you're gonna suck my dick.

16:17.227 --> 16:19.927
- You're gonna stop talkin',
and I'm gonna start suckin'.

16:19.929 --> 16:20.862
- It's time.

16:20.864 --> 16:21.929
- Alright, well I'm doin' it.

16:21.931 --> 16:23.698
Okay, alright.
- Alright.

16:23.700 --> 16:25.066
Come on, let's have a par--

16:32.308 --> 16:34.976
(uptempo music)

16:39.849 --> 16:41.849
Well, I don't think
that is something

16:41.851 --> 16:44.218
that we will ever un-see.

16:45.822 --> 16:48.890
- I just don't know how
you come back from that.

16:50.727 --> 16:52.226
- I don't think you'll
come back the same,

16:52.228 --> 16:53.428
I think you just accept

16:54.998 --> 16:57.498
that you're in a new
reality, and that life

16:57.500 --> 16:59.233
is just different now.

16:59.235 --> 17:03.171
- At what point did
you realize that it was

17:03.173 --> 17:04.906
- That we were goin'
- seeing.

17:04.908 --> 17:06.174
- For it?
- Yeah.

17:06.176 --> 17:07.709
- I think it was
tongue out and dick out

17:07.711 --> 17:09.077
and then the lean over,

17:09.079 --> 17:10.611
- The lean.
- is when I

17:10.613 --> 17:14.515
started to go, alright, we're
goin' to uncharted territory.

17:14.517 --> 17:16.718
- God, Corinne has it the
worst out of all of us though.

17:16.720 --> 17:19.420
- I don't think
there are gradations

17:19.422 --> 17:20.488
of who had it the worst.

17:20.490 --> 17:22.623
We were all equally traumatized.

17:22.625 --> 17:25.359
- No, she doesn't drink, so
she's gonna have the full-on

17:25.361 --> 17:28.496
just sober recollection of
everything that just happened.

17:28.498 --> 17:33.501
- She was stone cold,
mouth on dick sober.

17:34.938 --> 17:36.137
I'll be honest, I thought
my daughter wanting me dead

17:36.139 --> 17:37.205
was gonna be the
most memorable thing

17:37.207 --> 17:38.406
that happened this week.

17:38.408 --> 17:39.474
- No, this is it.
- Glad to see that was

17:39.476 --> 17:41.542
- Yeah.
- Outshined.

17:41.544 --> 17:45.613
- I think that actually was
a bit that went too far.

17:46.583 --> 17:49.517
- Yeah, yeah, wow.

17:52.255 --> 17:56.791
- On a separate note,
Todd's dick is like

17:56.793 --> 17:58.493
- So big.
- Really big.

17:58.495 --> 18:02.096
- Right, why is he
not more confident?

18:02.098 --> 18:04.599
- On the other hand, it did
sort of reverse engineer

18:04.601 --> 18:08.436
a way for us to all see
his dick as really big.

18:09.372 --> 18:10.204
- (bleep).

18:13.576 --> 18:16.244
Now I kinda wish I'd
taken a closer look at it.

18:17.180 --> 18:19.280
- I got a good, close look.

18:19.282 --> 18:20.181
- You were at a better spot.

18:20.450 --> 18:22.650
- Yeah, I had primeage poi.

18:22.652 --> 18:24.218
It was like--

18:24.220 --> 18:25.019
right there.

18:27.407 --> 18:28.940
- The way his mouth
was just on it.

18:28.942 --> 18:31.843
- Oh, it was just on it.

18:31.845 --> 18:33.611
- Wow, I'm so glad I
wasn't at that party.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.580
- I'm actually starting
to have a new appreciation

18:35.582 --> 18:37.849
for why these parties are
so uncomfortable for you.

18:37.851 --> 18:39.417
- Oh, that's all it took?

18:39.419 --> 18:41.986
- It was just, you know, quick
dick lick between friends

18:41.988 --> 18:42.954
to make me see the light.

18:42.956 --> 18:44.489
- Right.
- I feel like

18:44.491 --> 18:46.958
Gandhi's even said that, like
that's how you see the light.

18:46.960 --> 18:50.695
You see two friends quickly
lick dicks and then suddenly

18:50.697 --> 18:52.830
your whole world opens up.

18:52.832 --> 18:55.666
- Mommy, when I go live with
Uncle David, do you think

18:55.668 --> 18:57.134
he will let me have soda?

18:58.605 --> 19:01.873
- Okay, Daddy and I are not
going anywhere, Bubs, okay.

19:01.875 --> 19:04.809
You are not actually
moving in with your uncle.

19:04.811 --> 19:05.910
- But one day I could.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.714
I'm gonna show Walter
Uncle David's house.

19:09.716 --> 19:10.548
- Great.

19:12.118 --> 19:14.385
Well, I think one
could categorize that

19:14.387 --> 19:16.888
as a skippin' one step.

19:16.890 --> 19:19.190
- You're right, she seems
very okay if we die.

19:19.192 --> 19:23.261
- Okay, she is planning
our imminent demise.

19:23.263 --> 19:26.097
I'm gonna start putting napkins
on top of all my drinks.

19:26.099 --> 19:28.199
- Smart.
- In all seriousness though,

19:28.201 --> 19:31.135
are we like totally prepared
if something terrible like

19:31.137 --> 19:32.370
actually happens to us?

19:32.372 --> 19:34.138
- We're as prepared
as we can be, I guess.

19:34.140 --> 19:36.040
- I know that you have
a life insurance policy,

19:36.042 --> 19:37.775
and we decided that my
life was worth nothing,

19:37.777 --> 19:39.710
so it didn't make sense
for us to get one.

19:39.712 --> 19:42.547
But maybe, you know,
we look into getting me

19:42.549 --> 19:43.814
just like a small one.

19:43.816 --> 19:45.917
I want Amelia to have
at least a little

19:45.919 --> 19:47.151
walking around money.

19:47.153 --> 19:48.686
- Walking around money?

19:48.688 --> 19:49.887
- Yeah, I don't want her to
have to go to David for like

19:49.889 --> 19:52.089
every single little
thing she wants.

19:52.091 --> 19:54.358
He'll end up buying her a
Lennox phone and then nothing

19:54.360 --> 19:55.192
to wear to prom.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.961
- Aw, you're a good mom.

19:56.963 --> 19:59.530
- Aw, it only took you
six and 1/2 years for you

19:59.532 --> 20:00.998
to admit that.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.633
- But obviously we can't let
her know that there's any money

20:02.635 --> 20:03.467
on the line.

20:03.469 --> 20:04.302
- God no.

20:06.406 --> 20:07.238
- I really like this table.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.372
- Yeah, it's nice.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.874
Oh shit.
- What's wrong?

20:09.876 --> 20:11.742
- I've been waiting a week
for you to bend over and then

20:11.744 --> 20:15.346
after what I experienced last
night, the thrill is gone.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.114
- I mean, that works out for
me, so I'm not complaining.

20:17.116 --> 20:18.816
- You know what, that's actually
very selfish of you, Mike.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.084
- I'm okay with that.

20:20.086 --> 20:21.886
- Good, well stop just
thinking about yourself.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.154
- [Mike] Your place looks great.

20:23.156 --> 20:25.556
- Oh thank you,
and for the lady.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.192
- What?

20:28.194 --> 20:29.660
- I'm sorry, I'm sort of
getting into the spirit

20:29.662 --> 20:31.596
of like having people over
and like taking care of stuff.

20:31.598 --> 20:32.530
It's not gonna last for long.

20:32.532 --> 20:33.798
- You just called me a lady?

20:33.800 --> 20:36.033
- I mean, that's a loose
term I'll throw around.

20:36.035 --> 20:38.269
- I mean, David, I can't
believe you have like a couch

20:38.271 --> 20:40.871
and, what is this, an area rug?

20:40.873 --> 20:42.807
- Yeah, I am a grown ass man.

20:42.809 --> 20:46.143
- Okay, grown ass men do not
use the word grown ass man.

20:46.145 --> 20:48.245
- I don't think you have
any empirical proof of that.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.480
- Actually, you know what I do.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.616
I did a scientific
double blind study.

20:51.618 --> 20:52.917
It was peer reviewed.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.119
It got great reviews
from all the peers.

20:55.121 --> 20:58.489
You wouldn't believe how
much empirical proof I got.

20:58.491 --> 20:59.957
- Are you happy
with yourself now?

20:59.959 --> 21:01.492
- Actually, I do feel
pretty good about myself.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.327
- Honey, I wanted to tell
you, I think you're doing

21:03.329 --> 21:04.862
very, very well.

21:04.864 --> 21:07.031
- Oh God.
- Oh no, Mom is defending me.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.766
- Okay, sell your
house, get out now.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.635
- Alright, what is wrong
with me defending David?

21:10.637 --> 21:13.170
- Whenever you defend him,
it's clear that you don't think

21:13.172 --> 21:15.306
he's actually doing well, and
you're desperate for him not

21:15.308 --> 21:16.540
to know the truth.

21:16.542 --> 21:17.842
- Oh come on, I just
think, you know,

21:17.844 --> 21:19.910
he's doing very, very well.

21:19.912 --> 21:22.013
- No, whoa, Mom.
- Aah, oh my God, no.

21:22.015 --> 21:24.081
- Please stop
defending me, okay.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.950
I think at this point I
should just burn my house down

21:25.952 --> 21:27.184
and take the insurance money.

21:27.186 --> 21:28.319
- I honestly think
it's your only option.

21:28.321 --> 21:29.253
- Come on.
- I will help you.

21:29.255 --> 21:30.554
I will light the matches.

21:30.556 --> 21:31.822
- I'm getting more coffee.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.190
- Okay.
- Mom, if you could

21:33.192 --> 21:34.859
just backtrack and say
negative stuff about the house.

21:34.861 --> 21:37.595
- Tell him something terrible.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.196
Just do it.

21:39.198 --> 21:40.197
- What are you doing?

21:40.199 --> 21:42.099
Hey, I wasn't even bending over.

21:42.101 --> 21:45.302
- Well, the thrill is gone,
but it's not forgotten.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.804
- Uncle David, I found my room.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.340
It's really big and
it's got a fireplace.

21:49.342 --> 21:52.109
- Uh, Bubs, actually
I'm guessing

21:52.111 --> 21:54.045
that's probably
Uncle David's room.

21:54.047 --> 21:54.979
Is that your room
with the fire place?

21:54.981 --> 21:56.447
- Yeah.

21:56.449 --> 21:57.615
- You know what, there's
another room down the hall.

21:57.617 --> 21:58.516
Why don't you
check that one out.

21:58.518 --> 21:59.950
- Okay.

21:59.952 --> 22:02.553
- Why's your daughter pickin'
out a room in my house?

22:02.555 --> 22:04.889
- Because she's currently
planning our untimely demise,

22:04.891 --> 22:06.857
and you're her guardian, and
she will be living with you,

22:06.859 --> 22:08.159
so she needs a room.

22:08.161 --> 22:09.660
- Wait, I'm her guardian?

22:10.797 --> 22:13.564
- Yes, David, we
asked you years ago.

22:13.566 --> 22:14.832
- Really?

22:14.834 --> 22:16.767
- I'm concerned that
you don't know this.

22:16.769 --> 22:17.935
- We sent you paperwork.

22:17.937 --> 22:20.337
- Yes.
- Oh God.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.806
- Oh God?
- That's right.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.708
I'm sorry, would you
mind holding off on dying

22:23.710 --> 22:25.209
for a little while, because
I was planning on having like

22:25.211 --> 22:26.711
an at-home workspace here.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.245
- You know, let us know
when it's convenient for you

22:28.247 --> 22:30.414
and then we'll try to plan
on killing ourselves then.

22:30.416 --> 22:31.649
- Thank you, that'd be great.

22:31.651 --> 22:32.917
- Don't say I never
did anything for you.

22:32.919 --> 22:34.785
- Okay, Mommy,
I'll take that one.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.687
- I think it's nice your
uncle giving you a room

22:36.689 --> 22:38.155
in the house.

22:38.157 --> 22:40.324
- Well, actually, it's
only if something terrible

22:40.326 --> 22:42.359
and unexpected happens
to me and Mike.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.061
- Again, it's unlikely
anything will happen

22:44.063 --> 22:45.196
until we're very old.

22:45.198 --> 22:46.430
- Well, not always.

22:46.432 --> 22:47.932
My best friend died
when he was seven,

22:47.934 --> 22:49.500
drowned right in
front of my eyes.

22:49.502 --> 22:50.735
- Leon.
- What?

22:50.737 --> 22:53.537
I'm just sayin', things happen.

22:53.539 --> 22:55.372
- Wait, a kid can die?

22:56.976 --> 22:57.808
- Well--

23:00.780 --> 23:01.779
Technically--

23:03.216 --> 23:04.048
Yes.

23:07.420 --> 23:08.619
You know what?

23:08.621 --> 23:11.322
I think we all just
needed a new pet to help

23:11.324 --> 23:12.623
clear our minds.

23:12.625 --> 23:13.824
- Yes.

23:13.826 --> 23:16.293
- Saul looks so happy
in his new house.

23:16.295 --> 23:20.264
- You're right, Saul
does look very happy.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.734
- Mommy, he doesn't
want you to die.

23:25.104 --> 23:28.939
- Aw, tell Saul that I
appreciate that, Bubs, mwah.

23:30.276 --> 23:32.243
- I think he wants more carrots.

23:32.245 --> 23:34.111
- You know what, why
don't you grab him some.

23:34.113 --> 23:36.413
- Okay.
- Alright, good.

23:38.151 --> 23:39.450
- (bleep) Rich Ison.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.888
- I feel like I still see a
little bit of an Ison boner.

23:43.890 --> 23:46.557
Oh, Saul's really
starin' right at it.

23:47.894 --> 23:49.927
I knew I was gonna be
friends with this guinea pig.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.929
Saul, you're my people.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.535
- Really, 'cause Saul is
my grandfather's name.

23:57.537 --> 23:58.769
Saul Benchman Metermanders.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.371
- Okay, that can't
be a true story.

24:00.373 --> 24:01.872
Hi, Amy, how are you?

24:01.874 --> 24:03.107
- Good, what can I get for you?

24:03.109 --> 24:04.408
- I will have an
almond milk latte.

24:04.410 --> 24:05.643
- Regular person latte.

24:05.645 --> 24:07.444
- Got it, that'll
be eight bucks.

24:10.249 --> 24:11.415
- Do you have cash?

24:13.920 --> 24:18.789
- Yes, yes I do, right
here in my wallet.

24:19.725 --> 24:21.592
- I'll pay you back later.

24:21.594 --> 24:22.126
- That will be
wonderful, thank you.

24:23.095 --> 24:25.830
Here is cash from my wallet.
