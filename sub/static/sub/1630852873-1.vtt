WEBVTT

02:18.200 --> 02:20.800
-How'd you find me?

02:20.880 --> 02:22.040
Where else were you gonna be?

02:25.960 --> 02:27.120
It's been a while.

02:27.720 --> 02:28.840
Eight years.

02:36.640 --> 02:37.600
Oi. What the fuck?

02:43.840 --> 02:46.280
-Still a fucking lunatic.
-Oh, fuck off.

02:46.360 --> 02:47.520
You need to be careful.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.880
Look, it's just two guys
having a drink, innit?

02:50.960 --> 02:52.040
Celebrating!

02:52.640 --> 02:53.680
I'm finally out.

02:56.440 --> 02:59.480
There's something I have to tell you
about what happened.

02:59.560 --> 03:00.400
Huh?

03:01.600 --> 03:03.480
There's something I have to tell you.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.920
-What's wrong with you?
-Not here.

03:07.560 --> 03:10.520
Fuck is wrong with you?
Come on. We're here, so talk.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.720
-There's too many people.
-What?

03:14.800 --> 03:17.120
We're not supposed to be seen together.

03:17.760 --> 03:18.800
Call me tomorrow.

03:19.560 --> 03:21.640
-There's things you don't know.
-Yeah, what?

03:21.720 --> 03:23.840
There's things you don't know.

03:29.080 --> 03:30.400
Everything cool, boys?

03:31.400 --> 03:33.520
Come on, give 'em back.

03:33.600 --> 03:36.920
Well, I personally think
that everything's fantastic.

03:37.520 --> 03:40.920
These two fine young gentlemen over there
just bought me a beer,

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
so you can

03:42.080 --> 03:43.520
fuck off.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.440
Boys.

03:47.680 --> 03:48.520
Oh.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.520
-Fucking three of 'em?
-You, out.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.440
Do yourself a favor, mate, leave it.

03:53.520 --> 03:56.320
-Don't you put your hands on me.
-We're going home. We're going home.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.360
We're out. Don't--

03:59.320 --> 04:00.440
Fuck.

04:04.640 --> 04:05.640
Fuck!

04:09.400 --> 04:11.040
Ah! All right!

04:31.320 --> 04:32.440
Can I get a napkin?

04:35.520 --> 04:36.400
Hey.

04:37.440 --> 04:39.200
-Can I bum one of those?
-Yeah, sure.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.120
Cheers.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.600
Oh, shit, are you…

04:42.680 --> 04:44.600
Are you all right? You've got…

04:45.520 --> 04:46.440
It's nothing.

04:50.280 --> 04:51.320
Thanks.

04:53.280 --> 04:54.240
Rough night?

04:55.400 --> 04:57.480
It's not as bad as it looks.

04:59.560 --> 05:02.480
I think… Do you know what?
I think we should get a drink.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.880
After tonight with…

05:05.960 --> 05:07.680
-Yeah. I deserve one.

05:07.760 --> 05:09.560
Yeah. I mean, it's only fair.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.600
I've been needing this.
It's been a long night there as well.

05:17.080 --> 05:18.080
Okay.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.040
Yeah.

05:20.880 --> 05:22.720
Sweet. I'm Katja.

05:23.800 --> 05:24.680
Anton.

05:25.240 --> 05:26.200
-Hi.
-Hi.

05:27.520 --> 05:29.760
-Tequila's a good choice.
-Tequila?

05:29.840 --> 05:30.680
Yeah.

05:31.440 --> 05:33.560
-Have you tried mezcal?
-Yeah, love it.

05:33.640 --> 05:35.560
The place is through here.

05:35.640 --> 05:36.560
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.000
-So it's a good place.
-I'm up for some fun.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.600
Not too picky, you know?

05:42.320 --> 05:44.080
-I'll go for anything.
-Yeah?

05:45.440 --> 05:46.480
Run!

06:22.680 --> 06:24.200


06:25.400 --> 06:27.320


06:28.080 --> 06:32.840


06:33.560 --> 06:35.480


06:36.360 --> 06:38.200


06:38.920 --> 06:40.920


06:41.720 --> 06:44.240


06:44.320 --> 06:49.120


06:49.800 --> 06:54.760


06:55.920 --> 06:59.760


07:00.480 --> 07:05.240


07:28.320 --> 07:29.600


09:29.800 --> 09:31.480
He was looking right at me. I…

09:33.280 --> 09:34.200
I froze.

09:35.760 --> 09:37.360
Don't do that to yourself.

09:45.480 --> 09:48.680
I don't understand how everyone has
moved on as if nothing's happened.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.320
What? Nobody's moved on.

09:50.400 --> 09:53.960
I read that the bomb had something to do
with Hemberg's response to a gang dispute.

09:54.040 --> 09:57.240
If that bullshit theory catches on,
they could close down the inquiry--

09:57.320 --> 10:00.080
Listen, don't lecture me
about the inquiry, all right?

10:01.120 --> 10:02.600
You just fucking left.

10:06.560 --> 10:07.680
Have you been drinking?

10:09.560 --> 10:11.840
That's great, Kurt. That's really good.

10:12.720 --> 10:15.120
Newsflash. Life isn't fair.

10:15.920 --> 10:18.160
The difference between me and you

10:18.240 --> 10:20.520
is that I'm here
trying to do something about it.

10:20.600 --> 10:23.200
Yeah? Let me know
how that works out for you.

10:26.560 --> 10:27.760
Fucking kid.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.040
What the hell is this?

10:33.360 --> 10:35.200
-Hey.
-Hello, officers.

10:35.280 --> 10:36.640
-Did you call this in?
-Yeah.

10:36.720 --> 10:37.680
What did you see?

10:37.760 --> 10:40.280
Um, something up there,
I don't know, like a body.

10:40.360 --> 10:43.680
-Like a body or it is a body?
-I think it's a body. I'm not sure.

10:43.760 --> 10:45.120
-All right, stand here.
-All right.

10:45.200 --> 10:48.080
-I'll check it out, Fred.
-You all right? Stand right here, man.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.120
What's your name?

10:50.280 --> 10:51.160
Dom.

10:52.720 --> 10:53.760
Just out.

10:54.360 --> 10:57.120
-You been taking something?
-No, no, no, just alcohol.

10:59.120 --> 11:00.600
Yeah, I'm sure.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.680
-I think we got something here, Fred.
-Coming up!

11:23.760 --> 11:25.440
Stand there so I can see you.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.200
It's not looking good.

11:32.920 --> 11:34.360
Oh, Jesus Christ.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.840
Your resignation request,

11:41.200 --> 11:42.600
I didn't hand it in.

11:43.120 --> 11:43.960
What?

11:45.000 --> 11:48.280
I thought I'd give you a chance
to calm down, but I can't do it forever.

11:48.360 --> 11:50.840
If you don't turn up soon,
you're gonna lose your job.

11:55.880 --> 11:56.720
Rask.

11:58.720 --> 11:59.600
Yeah.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.360
Okay, I'm on my way.

12:05.160 --> 12:06.040
What is it?

12:06.760 --> 12:07.680
Hit-and-run.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.320
And they're asking for a detective?

12:11.000 --> 12:11.840
Why?

12:12.440 --> 12:15.040
You can't win the fight
unless you get back in the ring.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.320
Good morning.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.840
-You were talking in your sleep.
-Was I?

12:44.920 --> 12:45.800
Mm-hmm.

12:46.560 --> 12:47.680
What did I say?

12:48.200 --> 12:51.040
I couldn't tell,
but it sounded like a nightmare.

12:51.960 --> 12:53.280
And you were sweating.

12:54.400 --> 12:55.880
Are you sure you're okay?

12:59.400 --> 13:01.760
I'm great, now that you're here.

13:04.760 --> 13:05.600
What?

13:07.040 --> 13:08.320
-Nothing.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.280
So I was thinking…

13:16.360 --> 13:17.360
Mm-hmm.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.200
Maybe you could move in here,

13:20.280 --> 13:22.320
now that you can't keep your sublet.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.720
Would you really put up with me,

13:24.800 --> 13:26.760
sweating, shouting in the night?

13:28.240 --> 13:31.720
If you made a fuss of me every so often,
I could probably put up with it.

13:37.960 --> 13:39.960
Did you hear back about that security job?

13:41.760 --> 13:43.320
-Yeah.
-That's great.

13:44.840 --> 13:46.040
Are you gonna take it?

13:49.440 --> 13:51.800
Or I could help you find something else.

13:53.360 --> 13:54.720
Strip-o-gram cop maybe?

13:55.240 --> 13:56.080
Yeah.

13:57.960 --> 13:58.920
What?

14:02.280 --> 14:03.680
You miss it, don't you?

14:33.520 --> 14:34.800
Brother Kurt.

14:35.400 --> 14:36.760
You're leaving us.

14:38.360 --> 14:39.840
Yeah, I'm moving into town.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.720
Good. Good.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.040
I'm happy for you.

14:43.760 --> 14:45.440
And I think they need your wisdom.

14:45.960 --> 14:48.920
From what I hear,
there's a lot of shit going down there.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.920
If we let the day traders run wild,
what kind of society would we have?

14:53.400 --> 14:55.840
Go clean the place up, like you did here.

14:57.280 --> 14:58.960
Build your bridges.

15:01.240 --> 15:02.280
Hey, Kurt.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.480
Take care of yourself.

15:07.600 --> 15:08.800
You're not too bad

15:09.640 --> 15:10.600
for a cop.

15:14.040 --> 15:15.080
Back to work.

15:50.720 --> 15:51.640
Hey.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.480
What are you doing?

15:54.280 --> 15:56.160
I'm coming. Go back to bed.

15:56.240 --> 15:57.720
It's four o'clock.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.880
I know being a cop has its downsides.

16:05.480 --> 16:06.360
What?

16:06.440 --> 16:10.240
I just need to accept that every now
and then I have to do things I don't like.

16:11.160 --> 16:13.800
But this time, I won't let it get to me.

16:15.280 --> 16:17.920
And I promise you
I won't let it come between us either.

16:18.840 --> 16:20.080
You're going back.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.480
That's great.

17:03.720 --> 17:06.480
We've lost touch
with the people we signed up to serve.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.680
These days,
they grow up mistrusting the police.

17:09.760 --> 17:13.160
They learn not to cooperate, not to talk.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.840
People are afraid of us.

17:15.640 --> 17:18.960
I've known innocent men and women
who would rather face jail

17:19.040 --> 17:20.760
than cooperate with the police.

17:21.560 --> 17:24.400
Perhaps because they've already
been mistreated by us,

17:24.480 --> 17:27.760
or they're afraid they will be simply
because of how they look, how they sound,

17:27.840 --> 17:29.040
where they're from.

17:29.120 --> 17:30.960
What does that say about us?

17:31.480 --> 17:34.760
Should the language a citizen speaks
be more important to us

17:34.840 --> 17:36.400
than their safety and protection?

17:37.160 --> 17:39.120
We need to regain their trust.

17:40.440 --> 17:47.080
The way to do that is to follow protocol
in every decision and every encounter.

17:48.400 --> 17:52.560
We need to look ourselves in the mirror,
and we need to be proud of who we see.

17:53.160 --> 17:57.840
Now, the good news is
we are the change we've been waiting for.

17:59.040 --> 18:00.440
That change starts today.

18:00.520 --> 18:02.640
I've got ideas,
but I'd love to hear yours.

18:02.720 --> 18:03.880
My door's always open,

18:03.960 --> 18:06.960
and I look forward
to meeting you individually

18:07.040 --> 18:08.240
in the coming days.

18:09.040 --> 18:09.960
Thank you.

18:11.560 --> 18:13.560
Can you please come over here?

18:18.080 --> 18:19.520
-Are we done?
-Yes.

18:23.320 --> 18:24.320
Thank you.

18:31.240 --> 18:34.960
Well, look at this. Shit. Goddamn.

18:35.560 --> 18:37.720
-Come here, man.

18:37.800 --> 18:38.880
Welcome back, man.

18:40.040 --> 18:42.200
I want to apologize.
I've been a real arsehole, okay.

18:42.280 --> 18:44.840
-You've been an arsehole your whole life.

18:44.920 --> 18:48.080
Nah, listen,
it's been a tough few weeks for everyone.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.200
Come on, man.

18:51.760 --> 18:54.800
-So, the new guy's landed.
-Mm-hmm.

18:54.880 --> 18:57.880
-You gonna behave yourself?
-I'll try, do my best.

18:57.960 --> 18:58.920
Good.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.680
Well, listen, Jaz has been stressing me
about this Mona situation.

19:01.760 --> 19:05.040
She wants to meet the girl. She wants
to cook dinner and have you round.

19:05.120 --> 19:09.120
-No, no. It's my turn. We'll cook for you.
-Look at you all grown up.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.640
Check with Jasmine when's a good time,
and I'll check with Mona.

19:11.720 --> 19:13.720
I will. She's gonna be so excited, man.

19:13.800 --> 19:17.320
But no talk about my single life

19:17.400 --> 19:19.880
-and nothing about any exes, all right?

19:21.840 --> 19:25.000
You're acting like your life
is that interesting anyway. All right.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.160
I'll call you.

19:26.680 --> 19:28.560
All right, man.
It's good to have you back.

19:47.640 --> 19:48.640
I've got it.

20:11.160 --> 20:12.080
Thanks.

20:19.240 --> 20:21.880
Detective Wallander
keeps his own schedule?

20:21.960 --> 20:24.360
You read the report.
You know what he's been through.

20:24.440 --> 20:27.840
I know he left a colleague during a riot
to pursue an armed man on his own.

20:27.920 --> 20:31.000
That man was a suspect
in a terrorist attack.

20:31.080 --> 20:34.000
Rosengaard. Teenage boy,
hand grenade in his mouth.

20:34.080 --> 20:37.760
He almost got himself and a colleague
killed. There's a reason we have protocol.

20:37.840 --> 20:39.960
Internal Affairs have cleared him
of any wrongdoing.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.000
Yes, they have.

20:41.080 --> 20:43.080
I'll be making my own assessment.

20:48.840 --> 20:49.760
Understood.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.440
Wallander just needs a chance
to get back in the game.

21:06.920 --> 21:07.800
Hey.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.360
Look who decided to show up for work.

21:11.960 --> 21:14.840
Right, come on. I want you to check out
last night's hit-and-run with me.

21:14.920 --> 21:17.040
Hit-and-run? Isn't this Major Crimes?

21:17.120 --> 21:18.880
Well spotted.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.680
Reza sent me over the case file.

21:20.760 --> 21:23.800
To be honest, in hindsight,
something feels a little bit off.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.480
Besides, I thought
we could ease you back in gently.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.760
Save the serial killers for next week.

21:30.280 --> 21:32.560
I thought you'd be
next in line to run the unit.

21:33.080 --> 21:36.320
Just make sure you impress him.
Believe me, you need to.

21:45.640 --> 21:47.200
There are no tire marks.

21:48.680 --> 21:49.920
No ID on the victim.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.520
His face was destroyed
beyond all recognition.

21:52.600 --> 21:53.800
He put his hands down

21:53.880 --> 21:55.840
to try and stop himself
from being dragged,

21:55.920 --> 21:57.720
tore the skin right off. I know.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.960
No wallet, a few quid in his arse pocket,

22:00.040 --> 22:02.880
and a pay-as-you-go mobile,
which disintegrated on impact,

22:03.960 --> 22:04.840
and some keys.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.640
Uh, here.

22:07.560 --> 22:10.240
This is where we found the smashed glass
from the headlight.

22:13.920 --> 22:16.600
Hard to believe the driver
didn't see the guy in here.

22:17.120 --> 22:17.960
Drunk?

22:18.920 --> 22:21.000
That was Officer Al-Rahman's theory.

22:21.520 --> 22:23.720
A few kids, out on the town, pissed,

22:23.800 --> 22:25.200
music up too loud.

22:25.280 --> 22:27.320
-Uniforms checked for CCTV?
-Yeah.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.160
Camera's broken.

22:32.600 --> 22:33.600
I don't know.

22:36.080 --> 22:38.800
This alley's barely wide enough for a car.

22:38.880 --> 22:40.920
And if the car hit him there,
why didn't he--

22:41.000 --> 22:43.560
I get it. Why didn't he just jump
behind the scaffolding? I know.

22:43.640 --> 22:45.240
You're right. It doesn't make any sense.

22:45.320 --> 22:48.680
Let's focus on trying
to ID our boy for now, shall we?

22:48.760 --> 22:52.520
The shirt that he was wearing
probably means he was on a night out.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.040
I've dropped some comparable images
in your inbox.

22:55.120 --> 22:55.960
Thanks.

22:56.040 --> 22:59.360
-Start with the local bars and clubs?
-I'll do that. Great.

23:01.720 --> 23:02.720
Wallander.

23:03.800 --> 23:04.640
That way.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.600
-Hi. Did you work Friday night?
-Yeah, I did.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.800
So I'm looking for a guy
wearing this shirt.

23:53.880 --> 23:55.440
-No idea.
-You sure?

23:55.520 --> 23:56.480
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

23:56.560 --> 23:59.320
I'm looking for a guy,
Friday night, this shirt.

24:01.280 --> 24:02.120
No.

24:26.560 --> 24:27.880
We're closed.

24:29.680 --> 24:31.360
Licenses are all up to date.

24:31.440 --> 24:32.520
Not why I'm here.

24:33.520 --> 24:34.480
The hit-and-run?

24:35.760 --> 24:38.080
I noticed you have CCTV cameras
at the entrance.

24:38.160 --> 24:39.720
Yeah, we can take a look.

24:45.280 --> 24:46.760
The quality's not great.

24:46.840 --> 24:49.080
Yeah, the cameras are more for show.

24:50.080 --> 24:53.080
-Can I get a copy of this anyway?
-Yeah, sure.

24:58.280 --> 24:59.240
What's this?

24:59.320 --> 25:02.440
Customers can post pictures
of their mates, send messages.

25:02.520 --> 25:03.840
All comes up here.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.920
And it's all on our social media.

25:06.520 --> 25:08.240
Make sure you give us a like.

25:21.880 --> 25:23.240
All right, gentlemen.

25:24.880 --> 25:26.000
Time to give it up.

25:47.200 --> 25:49.720
<i>Hi. This is Anton. Leave a message.</i>

25:50.480 --> 25:51.960
Elias.

25:53.600 --> 25:55.440
Where are you?

25:58.480 --> 26:00.440
Yeah, how's the face this morning?

26:01.960 --> 26:04.600
Listen, are we
still gonna meet up or what?

26:06.120 --> 26:08.480
Yeah, well,
you just give me a call, all right?

26:09.560 --> 26:10.560
Love you.

26:34.760 --> 26:35.600
Hi.

26:38.320 --> 26:41.640
I'm looking for a guy from last night.
He was wearing this.

26:43.800 --> 26:46.600
He was here
with one of the girls from Kitchen.

26:50.480 --> 26:52.160
Hi, you work here, right?

26:53.120 --> 26:55.680
-There was a hit-and-run here last night.
-Yeah, I heard.

26:55.760 --> 26:58.840
-We're looking for witnesses.
-Sorry, I didn't see anything.

26:58.920 --> 26:59.760
You sure?

27:00.320 --> 27:01.160
Thanks.

27:12.880 --> 27:14.680
I'll take one second, thank you.

27:17.640 --> 27:19.120
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

27:20.200 --> 27:21.840
Um, just one second.

28:29.800 --> 28:30.640
Hey.

28:31.360 --> 28:32.320
It's okay.

28:34.680 --> 28:36.280
Do you wanna grab a coffee?

28:46.240 --> 28:47.320
I'm sorry I ran.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.600
I work off the books, so…

28:51.600 --> 28:53.920
-I didn't know who you were.
-It's okay.

28:55.960 --> 28:57.960
How did you get that cut on your hand?

28:59.280 --> 29:01.040
Just broke a glass.

29:03.840 --> 29:05.240
And what happened to your face?

29:10.360 --> 29:12.120
The night of the hit-and-run,

29:12.200 --> 29:13.720
I know you saw something.

29:19.680 --> 29:23.200
I just had a break,
just to get some fresh air,

29:23.280 --> 29:27.120
and a guy came past,
so I bummed a cigarette over there,

29:27.200 --> 29:30.600
and next thing I know, um…

29:33.360 --> 29:35.080
…a car's hurtling towards us.

29:38.160 --> 29:39.000
Sorry.

29:39.080 --> 29:40.160
Are you okay?

29:40.680 --> 29:41.960
I'm fine. Um…

29:42.560 --> 29:46.280
Yeah, Anton pushed me down there

29:46.360 --> 29:47.400
really hard.

29:47.480 --> 29:48.920
Wait, wait, wait. Anton?

29:49.840 --> 29:50.680
Yeah.

29:53.640 --> 29:55.600
Yeah, I think his name was Anton.

29:56.560 --> 29:59.120
You were with him?
Why didn't you come forward?

29:59.200 --> 30:01.400
You must've known
we'd be looking for witnesses.

30:01.480 --> 30:02.880
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm…

30:04.960 --> 30:07.280
Yeah, you're right. I should have. Um…

30:09.080 --> 30:11.480
But I didn't wanna get into trouble,
that's all.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.040
You didn't see the driver?

30:16.360 --> 30:17.200
No.

30:20.120 --> 30:21.720
Did you get a look at the car?

30:24.240 --> 30:25.560
-No.
-No?

30:25.640 --> 30:27.120
It was, um…

30:27.960 --> 30:29.280
Was it a big car?

30:29.360 --> 30:30.680
Old car? New car?

30:30.760 --> 30:32.520
Anything. Anything, Katja.

30:32.600 --> 30:33.600
Um…

30:34.800 --> 30:38.040
It was one of those shit ones
that your dad might drive.

30:38.560 --> 30:39.560
A sedan?

30:39.640 --> 30:40.480
Yeah.

30:42.760 --> 30:46.760
Um, I couldn't work out the color.
It was something dark.

30:49.080 --> 30:49.920
Okay.

30:50.440 --> 30:53.800
Can I get your number?
I think I'd like to talk to you again.

30:53.880 --> 30:56.040
Yeah. Yeah.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.360
<i>Hi. This is Anton. Leave a message.</i>

31:13.600 --> 31:14.800
Hey, listen, hi.

31:16.640 --> 31:18.120
Where the fuck are you?

31:19.800 --> 31:22.120
Just… Just call me back.

31:34.040 --> 31:36.200
POLICE

31:38.920 --> 31:41.600
Can't believe how nutty she's become.

31:43.400 --> 31:45.920
-Stressful times.
-Change things a little.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
-Yeah, but anyway, I'm--
-Hi there.

31:48.520 --> 31:50.440
-Hey.
-Hey.

31:50.520 --> 31:53.480
Glad you're still here. Someone told me
you were moving to your boyfriend.

31:53.560 --> 31:56.320
Yeah, I told him
that was never gonna happen.

31:56.400 --> 31:59.320
This girl isn't ready
to leave the city just yet.

31:59.400 --> 32:02.960
But he's so sweet though.
He packed a lunch for my train journey.

32:03.040 --> 32:04.840
Mango yogurt and chocolate milk.

32:04.920 --> 32:07.000
Oh, wish my girlfriend
would do that for me.

32:07.080 --> 32:08.600
-Oh, you a bit jealous?
-Mm-hmm.

32:10.160 --> 32:11.960
So did you get the phone
from the hit-and-run?

32:12.040 --> 32:17.240
Yes, I certainly did, and it was in bits,
but I managed to bring it back to life.

32:17.320 --> 32:20.320
I'll work on the algorithms,
see if I can get some more stuff.

32:20.400 --> 32:23.600
-But the guy had Runkeeper.
-Uh-huh.

32:24.200 --> 32:28.040
Lindängen. Anton Nyberg, born '97.

32:28.120 --> 32:29.520
Unmarried, on welfare.

32:30.440 --> 32:32.920
I've just sent you his address.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.400
-You're a star, thanks.
-Yeah, I know.

32:35.480 --> 32:37.280
Oh, and I also found this.

32:37.880 --> 32:42.400
This is the social security office's
camera on the corner of West Street.

32:42.480 --> 32:45.240
I can't get the plates up,
no image of the driver,

32:45.320 --> 32:47.520
and it's impossible to tell
the exact color of the car,

32:47.600 --> 32:51.760
but this is 700 meters north
of the end of the tunnel.

32:52.920 --> 32:54.320
-It's a dark sedan.
-Yeah.

32:54.400 --> 32:58.640
-When was this?
-The Runkeeper signal stopped at 3:07 a.m.

32:58.720 --> 33:00.680
And this, two minutes later.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.960
Yeah, I mean,
it's a lot of moving parts, Kurt,

33:04.040 --> 33:06.040
but I thought you should have it anyway.

33:06.120 --> 33:07.680
-Can you run it again?
-Yeah.

33:08.760 --> 33:10.920
-The driving doesn't look erratic.
-No.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.360
Guessing he wasn't under the influence.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.600
But like you say, that could be any car.

33:27.440 --> 33:31.480
Staffan, I need to go sort something out,
but I'll be back in time for counseling.

33:31.560 --> 33:33.480
Look, your parole officer's
gonna be here soon.

33:33.560 --> 33:35.280
-Come on.
-You need to run it by him.

33:35.360 --> 33:36.880
Tomorrow's probably better, yeah?

33:37.520 --> 33:38.440
Yeah.

34:26.960 --> 34:28.360
Where are you off to?

34:28.440 --> 34:31.200
Modin's got me an address
from the victim's mobile.

34:31.280 --> 34:34.200
Well, you do know
if it's the right address,

34:34.280 --> 34:36.120
our guy's not gonna answer the door.

34:36.200 --> 34:39.120
Well, we've got the keys
found at the hit-and-run.

34:39.200 --> 34:42.920
-Should confirm we have the right guy.
-No entry without a warrant though.

35:46.840 --> 35:47.720
Hello?

37:25.600 --> 37:26.600
Hi.

37:27.720 --> 37:28.960
Who the hell are you?

37:31.680 --> 37:34.040
A friend of Anton's.
I was just looking for him.

37:34.120 --> 37:36.560
You're a friend of Anton's.

37:40.360 --> 37:42.040
So how the hell did you get in?

37:44.520 --> 37:46.760
Listen, I'm from the police.
I'd like to talk to you.

37:51.040 --> 37:52.320
-Get off!
-Hey!

37:52.400 --> 37:54.960
Hey! Easy. I just wanna talk.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.640
Take it easy. Easy. Easy.

37:57.520 --> 37:59.960
I just wanna talk with you, okay?

38:20.160 --> 38:22.160
Hey! Wait!

38:53.360 --> 38:54.200
Rask.

38:54.280 --> 38:56.920
Osei's just blasted out of here
five minutes ago.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.800
<i>He's been called to the district court.</i>

38:58.880 --> 39:00.600
<i>-He wants you to meet him there.</i>
-Me?

39:01.120 --> 39:02.360
You sure? Why?

39:02.440 --> 39:04.120
Absolutely no idea.

39:04.200 --> 39:07.160
Just whatever you're doing, drop it
and get your arse over there.

39:07.240 --> 39:09.440
And, Kurt, please, whatever you do,

39:09.520 --> 39:11.000
<i>try not to piss him off.</i>

39:12.080 --> 39:13.200
I'm on my way.

39:36.120 --> 39:37.680
Detective Kurt Wallander.

39:43.520 --> 39:44.760
Smarten yourself up.

39:46.160 --> 39:48.320
-We haven't met before--
-Rask has filled me in.

39:48.400 --> 39:49.240
Okay, great.

39:50.160 --> 39:51.240
What's this about?

39:51.320 --> 39:53.640
Well, that's what we're about to find out.

39:58.320 --> 40:02.800
You've opened an investigation
into a man named Anton Nyberg.

40:04.400 --> 40:05.240
Why?

40:05.960 --> 40:07.840
It's not his real name, is it?

40:10.440 --> 40:13.960
The Ministry would only red-flag
an investigation for a handful of reasons,

40:14.040 --> 40:18.440
most likely being Nyberg was living
under an assumed identity.

40:19.520 --> 40:21.920
-"Was"?
-Anton Nyberg is dead.

40:25.200 --> 40:27.240
He was killed in a hit-and-run.

40:29.360 --> 40:31.720
Well, that does change things a little.

40:36.280 --> 40:37.120
<i>Hey.</i>

40:38.360 --> 40:39.520
What's going on?

40:39.600 --> 40:41.960
We have identified the victim
of the hit-and-run.

40:43.600 --> 40:44.480
And?

40:45.880 --> 40:47.400
It's Elias Fager.

40:49.360 --> 40:50.880
-What?
-Fager…

40:50.960 --> 40:52.720
The kids who killed their teacher…

40:52.800 --> 40:55.160
It was Rask's first case in Major Crimes.

40:55.240 --> 40:58.360
It was your first case?
The Fager brothers?

40:58.880 --> 41:00.880
This stays between the three of us.

41:00.960 --> 41:03.520
Last thing we need
is the press getting hold of this.

41:04.760 --> 41:05.920
Do I make myself clear?

41:07.280 --> 41:08.120
Yes, sir.
