WEBVTT

00:07.125 --> 00:08.250
Although she's gone,

00:09.375 --> 00:11.500
Edna will always be
a beloved part of our dojo.

00:12.375 --> 00:13.625
She may have been 102,

00:14.041 --> 00:16.667
but she could still <i>hi-yah</i>
with the best of 'em.

00:18.041 --> 00:20.041
- And finally...
-

00:24.750 --> 00:26.250
Rudy, would you like to say something?

00:26.333 --> 00:27.458
What?

00:27.542 --> 00:29.125
No, I don't... I don't even know what I...

00:29.208 --> 00:30.166
It's fine.

00:30.834 --> 00:31.709
Okay, then.

00:31.792 --> 00:33.875
- In conclusion--
- Well, if you insist, I mean...

00:34.542 --> 00:36.792
We're here, so...

00:43.583 --> 00:44.458
"Edna.

00:45.291 --> 00:47.208
'E' is for energetic.

00:48.625 --> 00:50.458
'D' is for darling.

00:51.208 --> 00:53.542
'N' is for neck because she had one."

00:55.291 --> 00:56.792
The "N" s are hard for me.

00:58.417 --> 00:59.917
"And 'A' is for awesome.

01:03.208 --> 01:05.834
And now for her last name.
Girschenmeyerflugenbompter.

01:07.375 --> 01:10.250
- "'G' is for--
- Rudy, thank you.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.750
Now a few words from her favorite
sparring partner, Milton Krupnick.

01:21.458 --> 01:25.000
It feels like only yesterday
that Edna looked me in the eye and said,

01:26.000 --> 01:27.917
"Eat mat, beanpole!"

01:29.959 --> 01:31.125
To make sure she's here in spirit

01:31.208 --> 01:33.792
to spar with us for
many more years to come,

01:33.875 --> 01:35.166
I present...

01:35.250 --> 01:38.417
The Edna Girschenmeyerflugenbompter
Memorial Sparring Partner.

01:39.041 --> 01:40.667
- "'G' is for--
Rudy.

01:47.750 --> 01:49.625
That's the face she made
when she was in her...

01:50.500 --> 01:51.583
Beast mode.

01:51.917 --> 01:53.917
Aww...

01:54.333 --> 01:56.208
It's got a recording
of Edna's grunts inside.

01:58.792 --> 02:00.417
So please, as you leave,

02:00.500 --> 02:02.458
say good-bye to Edna the
way she would have wanted.

02:14.166 --> 02:16.375
Gentlemen, I was Edna's lawyer.

02:16.458 --> 02:18.417
Jack's the sensei in charge. Sue him.

02:19.834 --> 02:23.375
No, I'm here to let you know
that the three of you are in her will.

02:23.917 --> 02:26.125
And Edna was a very wealthy woman.

02:26.542 --> 02:27.959
That's not important.

02:28.041 --> 02:30.041
What matters is Edna was a beautiful soul

02:30.125 --> 02:31.709
and how much money
are we talking about, now?

02:32.333 --> 02:34.542
I'll come by tomorrow
and tell you what she's left you.

02:37.208 --> 02:38.500
- Yes!
- We're gonna be rich.

02:38.834 --> 02:40.250
Guys, please.

02:40.333 --> 02:42.750
We just lost Edna, all right?

02:42.834 --> 02:45.000
Have a little respect.
You should be ashamed.

02:49.917 --> 02:50.959
- Ka-ching!
- Winner, winner!

02:51.041 --> 02:51.959
Show me the money!

02:53.166 --> 02:56.458

03:32.250 --> 03:33.291
This is so exciting.

03:33.375 --> 03:35.291
I can't believe Edna named us in her will.

03:40.542 --> 03:41.959
I just heard about Edna.

03:42.041 --> 03:44.542
- Oh, I loved her more than anything--
- You're not in the will, Jerry.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.250
I'm going bowling.

03:47.250 --> 03:49.625
You know, since I was
her favorite sparring partner,

03:49.709 --> 03:52.000
Edna probably left me a
little more money than you.

03:52.291 --> 03:53.542
What are you talking about?

03:53.625 --> 03:56.000
I did her a favor and took
her granddaughter to a dance...

03:56.166 --> 03:59.083
which was kind of weird,
'cause Hazel was 63.

03:59.166 --> 04:00.959
You know, maybe we should
just listen to Rudy

04:01.041 --> 04:03.166
and not spin out about some money
we don't have.

04:05.500 --> 04:08.166
I just found an island online.

04:09.083 --> 04:12.542
I am going to buy it
and declare myself king!

04:17.375 --> 04:18.500
Let me guess...

04:18.583 --> 04:20.083
"king of the island guy".

04:20.375 --> 04:22.208
There's one at every will reading.

04:24.291 --> 04:26.083
Edna's been very generous
with her fortune.

04:26.417 --> 04:28.583
So far today, I've given away a yacht...

04:29.959 --> 04:31.667
- A helicopter...
-

04:31.750 --> 04:33.542
And a diamond the size of my foot.

04:33.625 --> 04:35.917
Mm, I've been looking for a foot diamond.

04:38.500 --> 04:43.333
"To Rudy Gillespie, Jack Brewer,
and Milton Krupnick, I leave ten--"

04:43.417 --> 04:45.458
Million dollars!

04:45.542 --> 04:47.458
Ten million dollars! We're rich!

04:49.291 --> 04:51.208
Actually, it's ten acres of land.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.083
Worth ten million dollars!

04:55.458 --> 04:57.208
Well, it is in paradise valley.

04:57.291 --> 04:58.583
You hear that, boys?

04:58.959 --> 05:00.291
We're going to paradise.

05:00.417 --> 05:01.583
-
- Yeah!

05:05.917 --> 05:07.291
You hear that, boys?

05:07.917 --> 05:09.291
We're leaving paradise.

05:12.959 --> 05:14.542
You know, Edna didn't leave me in her will

05:14.625 --> 05:16.792
because when I sparred with her,
I kept it real, yo.

05:17.291 --> 05:19.000
I mean, sure, it resulted in a broken hip,

05:19.083 --> 05:21.625
but, hey, we went right back
to sparring once I healed.

05:22.750 --> 05:24.875
There's a story about Edna in the paper.

05:24.959 --> 05:26.125
She swam with the sharks.

05:26.208 --> 05:27.917
She climbed mount Seaford.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.125
And she made a fortune running
her Cluck-a-Doodle Donut shop.

05:30.208 --> 05:32.041
I'll never forget her in that rooster suit

05:32.125 --> 05:35.083
outside her store, squatting
out a dozen donut holes.

05:35.166 --> 05:36.959
Doesn't get any fresher than that.

05:38.041 --> 05:39.041
Edna knew how to live.

05:39.709 --> 05:41.125
All the Phil does is work.

05:41.417 --> 05:42.792
I will never get to do all the things

05:42.875 --> 05:44.625
that I want to get to do
that I never get to do.

05:45.959 --> 05:46.917
Well, like what, Phil?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.166
Three things...

05:48.250 --> 05:50.625
"A", I want to do the skydive.

05:50.917 --> 05:53.125
"B," I want to be on the TV.

05:53.208 --> 05:54.125
And three,

05:54.625 --> 05:57.583
I want to meet famous action star,
Sylvester Stallion.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.041
You know what, Phil?

06:00.625 --> 06:02.000
I'm gonna help you do those things.

06:02.458 --> 06:03.709
Really, Jerry?

06:04.250 --> 06:05.333
Thank you.

06:05.417 --> 06:09.166
Because of you, I will finally be
the man that I always wanted to be.

06:11.125 --> 06:12.291
<i>♪ Hey, kids ♪</i>

06:12.375 --> 06:15.041
<i>♪ The magic birthday princess is here! ♪</i>

06:18.333 --> 06:19.834
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

06:19.917 --> 06:22.166
Why would Edna leave us
a worthless piece of land?

06:22.250 --> 06:23.875
I was so nice to her.

06:23.959 --> 06:26.083
Were you? Every time she
changed out of her gi,

06:26.166 --> 06:28.917
you would use her support
hose to drain your pasta.

06:29.959 --> 06:31.041
Good afternoon!

06:31.542 --> 06:35.458
Now, Mr. Poindexter said that you're
the cowpokes Edna left her land to.

06:35.542 --> 06:39.792
Yes, indeedy, we are said poked cows.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.250
I saw you boys on your land earlier today.

06:43.709 --> 06:44.834
Is everything all right?

06:44.917 --> 06:46.667
Because I heard a woman scream.

06:46.750 --> 06:48.000
Yes.

06:48.750 --> 06:50.041
Yes, that was a woman.

06:51.166 --> 06:53.166
- Rudy, that was--
- A woman...

06:53.625 --> 06:55.834
Who screamed because she had never seen
a tumbleweed before

06:55.917 --> 06:57.834
and thought it was capable
of biting him... her.

06:59.208 --> 07:00.333
I'm Doyle Bronson.

07:00.375 --> 07:01.875
I own the ranch next door.

07:02.166 --> 07:06.250
I'm sure you city boys have no use
for ten acres of scrub brush.

07:06.291 --> 07:09.583
How about I do you a favor
and give you $1,000 for it?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.291
- That's fantastic.
- I would love to.

07:11.417 --> 07:14.166
No, no, no. We are not interested
in selling. Thank you.

07:15.917 --> 07:18.792
Rudy, we have a chance to dump
that worthless piece of land

07:18.875 --> 07:20.000
and make some real money.

07:20.083 --> 07:21.166
Oh...

07:21.625 --> 07:23.500
young, naive Jack.

07:24.625 --> 07:26.542
Business negotiations are like a dance.

07:26.917 --> 07:29.291
And you're about ready to watch
me do a Tango with that man.

07:30.792 --> 07:32.917
It looks like you aren't
interested in selling.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.291
That's too bad. Take care, y'all.

07:35.375 --> 07:38.583
Y'all take care of yourselves also, y'all.

07:42.583 --> 07:44.208
Rudy, he's getting away.

07:44.291 --> 07:45.709
Look, relax.

07:45.792 --> 07:48.208
He's going to go to his car,
pretend like he's leaving,

07:48.291 --> 07:50.083
turn around, come back,
and double his offer.

07:50.542 --> 07:51.667
He's walking to his car.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.458
And the dance begins.

07:55.125 --> 07:56.291
He's getting in his car.

07:56.417 --> 07:57.667
<i>Ole!</i>

07:58.375 --> 08:00.041
-
- And he just drove off.

08:00.125 --> 08:02.083
What? Oh, no, what have I done?

08:02.166 --> 08:03.500
-
- Hey!

08:03.583 --> 08:05.041
Come back!

08:05.125 --> 08:06.750
We haven't finished our Tango.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.166
Come on, man. Dance with me!

08:10.959 --> 08:12.834
There's something weird
going on here, Rudy.

08:12.917 --> 08:15.750
Why would he offer us 1,000 bucks
for that worthless piece of land?

08:16.041 --> 08:18.291
Yeah. Maybe you're right, Milton.

08:19.125 --> 08:20.417
Maybe it's not worthless.

08:21.333 --> 08:23.875
Nope. It's totally worthless.

08:24.291 --> 08:25.583
There's nothing here.

08:25.917 --> 08:27.166
- Nothing here!
-

08:29.417 --> 08:30.542
There is something here.

08:31.083 --> 08:32.834
- A big, giant hole.
-

08:32.917 --> 08:34.000
And you found it.

08:35.959 --> 08:38.000
Oh, Jerry, thank you for getting me on TV.

08:38.834 --> 08:40.000
Yo, quiet, quiet, quiet.

08:40.083 --> 08:41.166
It's on.

08:43.208 --> 08:44.875
<i>I know what I smell, and it's bacon.</i>

08:45.291 --> 08:47.333
<i>Oh. I'm sorry. We're back.</i>

08:47.417 --> 08:48.792
<i>Welcome to "Chap Chat."</i>

08:48.875 --> 08:50.208
<i>I'm Chappy Chapman.</i>

08:50.291 --> 08:52.166
<i>Up next is a segment that I did earlier</i>

08:52.250 --> 08:53.959
<i>with local businessman Falafel Phil.</i>

08:54.458 --> 08:58.000
<i>This is a test of the Seaford
Emergency Network System.</i>

08:59.125 --> 09:00.500
What... what is happening?

09:00.583 --> 09:03.291
What is with the <i>♪ Ah... ♪</i>

09:03.375 --> 09:05.959
Well, don't worry, Phil.
I'm sure they'll cut right back to you.

09:06.041 --> 09:07.542
There'll be plenty of time
left in the show.

09:08.542 --> 09:10.208
That's all the time we have
left on the show.

09:11.458 --> 09:12.834
No one saw my face.

09:12.917 --> 09:14.083
I was not on the TV.

09:14.166 --> 09:15.375
What about my list?

09:15.458 --> 09:17.625
Don't worry, Phil. Look, I promise
I'll get you on next week.

09:17.959 --> 09:19.875
Unfortunately, there will be no next week.

09:19.959 --> 09:21.208
I've been cancelled.

09:22.500 --> 09:23.834
My boss thinks, and I quote,

09:23.917 --> 09:27.417
I'm a "narcissistic, mustachioed,
hulking freak who doesn't belong on TV."

09:28.291 --> 09:29.458
Well, you know what, Ed?

09:30.291 --> 09:31.375
I'll show you hulking freak!

09:42.834 --> 09:44.333
Whoa.

09:44.458 --> 09:45.834
What is this place?

09:45.917 --> 09:48.208
Uh, anyone wanna ask if I'm all right?

09:48.291 --> 09:51.208
- I've got a stalagmite lodged in my--
- Looks like a series of tunnels.

09:52.875 --> 09:54.917
Is there anything mentioned
about it on the land deed?

10:03.875 --> 10:05.000
Guys, look at the wall.

10:06.250 --> 10:08.625
This isn't just a deed. It's a secret map.

10:09.792 --> 10:11.542
No, no, no. It's more than that.

10:12.417 --> 10:13.417
It's also...

10:13.834 --> 10:15.041
a bunny.

10:17.709 --> 10:19.333
Look, now it's The Eiffel Tower.

10:20.792 --> 10:22.375
Rudy, this is no time...

10:22.458 --> 10:23.417
whoa.

10:25.834 --> 10:27.333
That's some solid shadow work.

10:29.333 --> 10:30.625
Guys, these aren't just tunnels.

10:30.917 --> 10:32.542
This is a gold mine.

10:32.625 --> 10:33.792
Edna did like us.

10:33.875 --> 10:35.792
We're rich. We're rich!

10:36.041 --> 10:37.583
- We're rich, we're rich, we're rich!
- Yes!

10:39.417 --> 10:42.208
I have got to stop jumping.

11:03.917 --> 11:04.959
Four...

11:07.417 --> 11:08.500
Five.

11:08.583 --> 11:09.667
This is it.

11:09.792 --> 11:11.125
This is the fifth support timber.

11:11.208 --> 11:13.125
According to Edna's map,
the last vein of gold in the mine

11:13.208 --> 11:14.458
should be in this section.

11:14.542 --> 11:17.291
All right, now, before we get started,
I just wanna say

11:17.375 --> 11:20.208
that when people come into sudden wealth,
it can sometimes change 'em.

11:20.291 --> 11:22.041
Friends have been known
to turn on one another.

11:22.208 --> 11:24.041
The miners called it "gold fever."

11:24.125 --> 11:25.917
Yeah, and...

11:26.000 --> 11:27.583
I just want you to know that that's...

11:28.375 --> 11:30.083
exactly what's gonna happen to me.

11:32.291 --> 11:33.917
Rudy, we're not going to do those things.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.250
Oh, no. I definitely am. Yeah.

11:35.750 --> 11:37.125
We haven't found a single nugget yet,

11:37.208 --> 11:39.166
and I'm already thinking
of ways to get rid of you.

11:39.583 --> 11:42.291
Join me, Milton. We can take down Jack.

11:43.083 --> 11:44.208
I'm not doing that.

11:45.583 --> 11:47.750
Join me, Jack. We can take down Milton.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.250
We are partners.

11:50.333 --> 11:52.792
Whatever we find, we'll put
in a pile and split three ways.

11:53.166 --> 11:54.166
Let's get to work.

11:59.417 --> 12:02.000
- Guys, guys, I see gold.
- Me too.

12:02.083 --> 12:03.625
Nothing on this end.

12:08.250 --> 12:10.667
Don't worry, Chuck.
I am trained professional.

12:10.917 --> 12:12.709
I will get your retainer back.

12:12.792 --> 12:15.542
I never ever stick my
hands in the ball return.

12:15.625 --> 12:16.875
It's very, very dangerous.

12:16.959 --> 12:18.291
I use my head.

12:21.875 --> 12:24.500
Oh! There is the retainer,
and, okay, and...

12:24.583 --> 12:25.959
-
Oh! Oh, no.

12:26.291 --> 12:27.417
Oh, no! I'm stuck!

12:27.500 --> 12:30.083
Chuck, Chuck, go get your mommy.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.333
Go!

12:31.875 --> 12:33.667
Yo, Phil. Phil, check it.

12:33.750 --> 12:36.417
Sylvester Stallion was in town for the
premiere of his new movie "Crocky II."

12:36.500 --> 12:38.083
I got him to come by so he could meet you.

12:38.166 --> 12:39.291
What?

12:39.375 --> 12:41.208
You know, whenever I'm in town,

12:41.291 --> 12:43.000
I always do what I can for my fans.

12:43.083 --> 12:44.250
You know what I'm saying?

12:44.917 --> 12:46.166
No, I really don't.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.750
Uh, hey, Stallion. Tell me.

12:48.834 --> 12:51.625
Are you as pretty in person
as you are in the moving picture?

12:51.959 --> 12:55.208
Yo, I can't understand
a word this guy is saying.

12:57.458 --> 12:58.291
Gotta go.

12:58.375 --> 13:00.583
No, come back! Stallion, don't go!

13:02.125 --> 13:03.709
Jerry, get me out of here.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.375
Oh, wait, wait, wait. I just got an idea.

13:08.667 --> 13:11.083
The ball will come back up
the return and pop you out.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.291
What? No!

13:12.417 --> 13:15.166
Jerry, no. That's a very bad idea.

13:15.250 --> 13:16.166
A very bad...

13:19.375 --> 13:21.000
Good news, Chuck.

13:21.083 --> 13:22.291
I found your retainer.

13:27.667 --> 13:28.625
All right, guys...

13:29.792 --> 13:30.709
let's take a break,

13:30.834 --> 13:33.458
dump our buckets of gold in this
wheelbarrow, and see how much we got.

13:37.583 --> 13:38.917
- Impressive.
- Nice.

13:39.333 --> 13:40.291
All right.

13:44.166 --> 13:45.750
That's what I'm talking about.

13:45.834 --> 13:47.291
- Wow.
- All right.

13:47.375 --> 13:50.166
Stand back, boys.
It's time for the mother lode.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.291
- All right.
-

14:00.083 --> 14:02.291
Cha-ching!

14:02.792 --> 14:04.375
Time for that three-way split.

14:04.750 --> 14:06.625
Hey, not so fast, Rudy.

14:06.875 --> 14:08.834
We've been working the
same vein for two hours.

14:08.917 --> 14:12.208
I get a bucketful, Milton gets a
bucketful, and you get a pebble?

14:13.917 --> 14:15.250
Jack's right. You're hoarding it.

14:16.208 --> 14:17.667
How dare you.

14:17.750 --> 14:20.542
I don't have to stand here and
listen to you call me a thief.

14:30.041 --> 14:31.875
If he's stealing gold,
then I'm taking this.

14:31.959 --> 14:33.583
If it wasn't for me being
able to read the map,

14:33.667 --> 14:34.959
there wouldn't be any gold.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.458
Hey, whoa!

14:36.542 --> 14:39.375
Once we got here, I was the
one who did most of the work.

14:40.041 --> 14:41.709
Hey, we never even
would have found the gold

14:41.792 --> 14:44.583
if I hadn't been smart enough
to accidentally fall down a hole.

14:45.208 --> 14:46.291
What?

14:46.375 --> 14:47.834
It's mine.

14:47.917 --> 14:49.083
Whoa!

14:49.625 --> 14:50.959
Ahh!

14:51.041 --> 14:52.291
Hey, neighbors.

14:52.917 --> 14:54.792
Thought you might like a little company.

14:56.250 --> 14:59.250
If it's to try and buy our land,
the price just went way up

14:59.333 --> 15:01.583
because this place is riddled with gold.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.834
Rudy, he's not here to buy the land.
He's here to steal the gold.

15:05.917 --> 15:07.500
What gold? There's no gold.

15:08.458 --> 15:10.000
Oh, yes, there is.

15:11.083 --> 15:12.208
And it's mine.

15:30.166 --> 15:31.500
Come on, boys!

15:35.250 --> 15:37.041
You'll never get our gold.

15:37.125 --> 15:38.583
'Cause it belongs to me.

15:38.667 --> 15:40.083
- Us.
- Whatever.

15:40.166 --> 15:41.834
You can keep your gold.

15:42.083 --> 15:44.291
But you'll be down here with it forever.

15:44.375 --> 15:45.458
No!

15:51.625 --> 15:52.959
Let's go, boys.

15:53.041 --> 15:54.667
- Let's get out of here before--
-

15:54.750 --> 15:56.625
He cut the bridge.
That was the only way out of here.

15:56.709 --> 15:58.291
And the gap is too wide.
We'll never clear it.

16:00.041 --> 16:01.041
I can jump it.

16:01.125 --> 16:02.667
I just gotta build up enough speed.

16:11.417 --> 16:15.166
Now, I know you didn't get on TV
or get to meet Sylvester Stallion,

16:15.834 --> 16:17.375
but you're definitely going skydiving.

16:18.291 --> 16:20.291
But what about my fear of the airplane?

16:20.834 --> 16:22.250
That's why I got this giant fan.

16:22.333 --> 16:25.458
It'll give you all the sensation
of actual skydiving,

16:25.542 --> 16:27.583
but you'll never go more
than five feet in the air.

16:27.917 --> 16:29.166
You're sure this thing will work?

16:29.709 --> 16:33.250
It's a giant fan I got off the back of my
cousin's swamp boat. What could go wrong?

16:34.166 --> 16:35.834
That makes sense to the Phil.

16:35.917 --> 16:37.375
Turn this bad boy up, bro.

16:45.333 --> 16:46.417
Okay.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.458
Whoa. Whoa.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.417
I'm flying. I'm flying!

16:51.500 --> 16:53.250
Oh, you can go a little higher than that.

16:53.291 --> 16:55.208
Oh... okay! Okay.

16:55.291 --> 16:56.250
Little higher.

16:56.291 --> 16:57.250
Whoa.

16:59.667 --> 17:02.208
Ooh... Yeah, I guess that could go wrong.

17:03.208 --> 17:04.667
This is Chappy Chapman.

17:06.875 --> 17:10.333
This is Chappy Chapman live at the
red carpet talking to Sylvester Stallion.

17:10.417 --> 17:12.166
What is "Crocky II" all about?

17:12.667 --> 17:14.250
Well, it's a heart-wrenching tale

17:14.333 --> 17:17.333
about boxing, reptiles, and love.

17:17.417 --> 17:20.041
So, I throw a left and right hook,

17:20.125 --> 17:21.750
- and a salamander...
-

17:24.834 --> 17:26.291
That's not good.

17:26.875 --> 17:27.875
Back to you, Brittney.

17:27.959 --> 17:28.834
What the...

17:30.875 --> 17:34.166
I'm going to throw this pickax with a rope
tied to it across, hook the dynamite,

17:34.250 --> 17:36.041
pull it over here and yank out the fuse.

17:38.875 --> 17:39.875
-
- You got it.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.375
Okay, come on. Easy, easy.

17:43.834 --> 17:45.166
Good, good, good. Easy, easy, easy.

17:45.250 --> 17:46.375
Okay.

17:46.458 --> 17:49.333
All I have to do is pull it up,

17:49.417 --> 17:52.333
and... oops.
The dynamite fell into the crevasse.

17:52.417 --> 17:55.083
The fuse was still lit.
We're all gonna die.

17:56.834 --> 17:58.250
Give me the pickaxes.

17:58.333 --> 17:59.458
All right.

17:59.542 --> 18:02.709
I'm going to use these pickaxes to
give us handles so we can swing across.

18:18.291 --> 18:19.291
Oh!

18:41.375 --> 18:42.417
I can't reach it.

18:43.875 --> 18:44.959
Well...

18:45.041 --> 18:47.041
All right, I'll swing back.
You grab my hand.

18:47.375 --> 18:49.250
That pickax won't hold both of us.

18:49.625 --> 18:51.291
That's a good point.
It was nice knowing you.

18:51.500 --> 18:52.375
Rudy.

18:54.792 --> 18:56.041
All right, fine.

18:56.125 --> 18:57.417
Take my hand.

19:06.208 --> 19:07.166
Come on, Rudy.

19:07.250 --> 19:08.250
Let's go!

19:11.083 --> 19:13.000
Get down, get down.

19:13.083 --> 19:15.208
She's gonna blow!

19:24.667 --> 19:26.000
She didn't blow.

19:34.667 --> 19:36.000
She blew.

19:41.834 --> 19:43.500
Oh, yo... it's on again.

19:44.041 --> 19:45.875
<i>- And the salamander takes a...

19:49.208 --> 19:50.166

19:50.250 --> 19:51.375

19:51.458 --> 19:54.250
See, Phil? We crossed
all three things off your list.

19:54.333 --> 19:56.875
You got on TV, you skydived... Hey!

19:56.959 --> 19:58.542
And you met Sylvester Stallion.

19:58.625 --> 19:59.458
Met him?

19:59.542 --> 20:01.375
We rode the ambulance
together to the hospital.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.375
Boy, was he mad at me.

20:03.458 --> 20:06.291
Yeah, the doctor said that's how
you got most of your injuries.

20:07.250 --> 20:08.458
Thank you, Jerry.

20:08.542 --> 20:11.792
Because of you, I'm finally the man
I always wanted to be.

20:22.291 --> 20:23.625
I got pretty crazy back there.

20:23.709 --> 20:24.667
Yeah, we all did.

20:24.750 --> 20:26.375
That gold made us turn on each other.

20:26.709 --> 20:28.208
Maybe it's better that it's gone.

20:28.291 --> 20:29.458
That gold would have changed us.

20:29.542 --> 20:32.083
Yeah, changed us into rich people.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.417
You know what...

20:36.500 --> 20:39.333
let's just promise to never
let greed come between us again.

20:39.417 --> 20:41.166
- Deal?
Deal.

20:42.750 --> 20:43.959
Wasabi.

20:48.208 --> 20:52.166
Just a teeny, tiny, little nugget of gold
fell out of my sleeve.

20:53.500 --> 20:54.458
How about that?

20:54.542 --> 20:55.583
- Crazy.

21:03.875 --> 21:06.083

that one last gold nugget
to a charity in Edna's name.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.458
I kind of went in a different direction.

21:11.959 --> 21:13.208
What do you mean?

21:16.792 --> 21:19.000
That's the third shower I've taken.

21:19.417 --> 21:20.875
I got dust from that mine everywhere.

21:20.959 --> 21:22.750
It was in my hair. It was in my ears.

21:22.834 --> 21:24.333
I think I even swallowed some.

21:24.458 --> 21:25.542
Swallowed some?

21:29.583 --> 21:30.834
Yeah, maybe a little bit.
