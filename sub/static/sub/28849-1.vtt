00:45.755 --> 00:48.172
Ganesh, clean the car.

00:55.047 --> 00:56.005
...here's your car.

00:56.588 --> 01:00.588
I wanted plates with numbers
that added up to nine.

01:00.672 --> 01:01.922
But these add up to 11.

01:04.505 --> 01:07.963
Eleven is a lucky number for some. Right?

01:09.380 --> 01:13.463
The Twin Towers were attacked on the 11th.

01:13.963 --> 01:16.505
September 11th
is the 254th day of the year.

01:16.963 --> 01:19.755
Those numbers add up to 11.

01:22.297 --> 01:23.963
...looked like an 11.

01:24.505 --> 01:28.172
The plane that crashed into them
was Flight 11.

01:28.630 --> 01:29.547
It was carrying...

01:30.463 --> 01:32.130
-That adds up to--
-Eleven.

01:32.213 --> 01:35.547
The pilot was Ramsy Yusouf.
His name adds up to 11--

01:39.547 --> 01:43.047
We don't choose the license plates.

01:43.338 --> 01:44.797
They are sent to us. Okay?

02:24.755 --> 02:28.505
No. I just picked up the car
from the showroom.

02:28.588 --> 02:29.588
<i>Anyway...</i>

02:31.547 --> 02:34.588
<i>You won't have to squeeze</i>
<i>into those crowded buses anymore.</i>

02:34.672 --> 02:37.338
<i>And don't be in a rush to remove</i>
<i>the plastic seat covers.</i>

02:37.422 --> 02:39.172
-Okay.
-<i>Keep them till they tear.</i>

02:39.255 --> 02:41.922
<i>Do the plate numbers add up to nine?</i>

02:42.005 --> 02:45.172
-No. It's 11.
-<i>Check it again.</i>

02:45.255 --> 02:47.422
<i>Math was never your strong suit.</i>

02:47.672 --> 02:51.380
-I did. It's 11.
-<i>It's okay.</i>

02:51.463 --> 02:53.588
<i>Is the Guru's picture up?</i>

02:53.922 --> 02:54.755
Yes.

02:54.838 --> 02:57.422
<i>Then you're fine.</i>
<i>He'll take care of everything.</i>

02:57.505 --> 03:00.213
<i>Don't forget to take the car</i>
<i>to the temple.</i>

03:00.297 --> 03:02.255
-Okay.
-<i>Drive carefully.</i>

03:02.338 --> 03:04.963
-<i>Mumbai roads aren't like Aurangabad.</i>
-Okay.

03:05.047 --> 03:10.838
<i>Until you get used to the car,</i>
<i>wear a helmet for a week or so.</i>

03:10.922 --> 03:12.630
-Mom...
-<i>What do you mean?</i>

03:12.713 --> 03:15.755
-<i>And take care of the keys.</i>
-Okay.

03:16.130 --> 03:17.422
Mom, I need to hang up.

03:17.505 --> 03:19.922
I don't want to get a ticket
on my first day.

03:20.005 --> 03:21.088
<i>Fine.</i>

03:21.505 --> 03:25.838
-<i>Are you practicing confidence-building?</i>
-I'm hanging up now.

03:25.922 --> 03:26.838
<i>And</i>--

04:12.338 --> 04:13.380
I have done that.

04:35.630 --> 04:36.547
Here's Ms. Uncool.

05:22.588 --> 05:28.547
The Dharavi slum is currently
the world's third largest slum.

05:28.630 --> 05:33.963
Dharavi has an active economy.

05:34.047 --> 05:38.338
Leather, textiles and pottery products

05:38.422 --> 05:42.922
are among the goods made here.

05:43.005 --> 05:44.963
This is where

05:45.047 --> 05:51.797
Danny Boyle's award-winning movie
<i>Slumdog Millionaire </i>was filmed.

05:52.213 --> 05:56.505
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Dharavi.

06:10.922 --> 06:13.422
<i>Hello, you ask me to make</i>
<i>And I make with a clove</i>

06:13.713 --> 06:16.297
<i>White and Chinese guys are shocked</i>

06:16.630 --> 06:19.172
<i>Don't waste your time by coming here</i>

06:19.255 --> 06:22.047
<i>Business is at a loss</i>
<i>I am cold-hearted, move away</i>

06:22.130 --> 06:24.213
<i>Life is not a joke, don't smoke</i>

06:24.297 --> 06:27.797
<i>Everything is cheap</i>
<i>It's just that I don't get sleep</i>

06:27.880 --> 06:30.630
<i>Debt doesn't stop me</i>
<i>I keep going fearlessly</i>

06:30.713 --> 06:33.588
<i>Business is touching the sky</i>
<i>It's just that you're sly</i>

06:33.672 --> 06:35.672
<i>Look at the Chinese</i>
<i>They sell nothing less than Mercedes</i>

06:36.088 --> 06:38.922
<i>The public is smart these days</i>
<i>Before you go, check your way</i>

06:39.005 --> 06:40.672
<i>We make the rules and regulations</i>

06:40.755 --> 06:43.547
<i>You're just after a dream</i>
<i>Oh yeah, fulfill that, don't scream</i>

06:43.630 --> 06:45.130
<i>You're just after a dream...</i>

06:55.297 --> 06:57.880
There are a lot of Chinese tourists
coming here these days.

06:58.172 --> 07:01.088
That guy who made the <i>Slumdog </i>movie
should be smacked.

07:01.172 --> 07:02.130
That's right.

07:05.713 --> 07:08.922
Ladies and gentlemen,

07:09.005 --> 07:11.588
an interesting piece
of information for you -

07:12.130 --> 07:17.755
this is the only place in the world

07:17.838 --> 07:21.088
that makes more counterfeit goods
than China!

08:31.255 --> 08:33.255
Yes. How much?

08:33.338 --> 08:35.713
Not now. Pay when you leave.

08:36.672 --> 08:37.588
Okay.

08:44.088 --> 08:46.922
-Where do I park?
-Take the first right up ahead.

08:53.838 --> 08:56.463
-Are you blind?
-What are you looking at? Move on.

08:56.547 --> 08:57.797
She could have killed me.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.213
Shall I park it for you?

09:00.713 --> 09:01.547
Yes.

09:02.838 --> 09:04.922
Be careful. It's brand new.

09:05.255 --> 09:06.422
I do this every day.

09:27.713 --> 09:28.547
Yes, ma'am.

09:43.588 --> 09:45.005
Take it and go.

09:52.713 --> 09:53.922
Take my offering.

10:09.255 --> 10:10.380
One <i>Misal Pav</i>.

10:11.755 --> 10:13.547
Where's the pay-and-park lot?

10:14.880 --> 10:16.172
There isn't any...

10:16.255 --> 10:19.297
What is this?
It's a receipt for the public restroom.

10:20.380 --> 10:22.505
Did you park in a no-parking zone?

10:22.588 --> 10:24.797
They must have towed your car away.

10:25.505 --> 10:28.172
The pay-and-park guy parked my car.

10:28.963 --> 10:29.922
He parked it for you?

10:35.172 --> 10:36.838
I think your car has been stolen.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.172
What's the complaint?

11:15.797 --> 11:17.297
My car was stolen.

11:19.005 --> 11:19.838
From where?

11:20.297 --> 11:22.213
From near the Mahalakshmi temple.

11:23.838 --> 11:24.838
Your name?

11:25.880 --> 11:27.338
Nirma Sahastrabuddhe.

11:29.130 --> 11:30.255
Nirma?

11:31.297 --> 11:32.713
As in the washing powder?

11:37.213 --> 11:38.338
Where did you park it?

11:39.213 --> 11:40.963
I didn't park it myself.

11:41.380 --> 11:43.505
I thought this guy
was the pay-and-park valet.

11:43.588 --> 11:45.255
I gave him the keys. So he...

11:46.713 --> 11:48.005
You handed him the keys?

11:50.088 --> 11:51.130
That's not theft.

11:52.922 --> 11:54.255
You gifted a car to a thief.

11:56.255 --> 11:57.088
Make and model?

12:00.005 --> 12:02.005
I'll be 25 in March.

12:03.672 --> 12:05.130
I was talking about the car.

12:07.005 --> 12:08.672
It was brand new.

12:08.755 --> 12:11.088
I picked it up
from the showroom this morning.

12:11.880 --> 12:14.088
The plastic covers
were still on the seats.

12:16.672 --> 12:17.713
License plate number.

12:24.005 --> 12:26.505
Please write your address
and phone number.

12:26.588 --> 12:27.713
Sign at the bottom.

12:31.047 --> 12:32.255
Will I get my car back?

12:32.672 --> 12:33.630
Of course.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.297
I'll mobilize the entire force,

12:37.672 --> 12:38.963
and find your car.

12:45.838 --> 12:49.047
Make sure you give him
your property papers.

12:49.338 --> 12:50.463
-Property papers?
-Yeah.

12:50.547 --> 12:54.422
I'll be going there tomorrow. Call him.

13:04.213 --> 13:07.088
You're here about your car, right?

13:10.338 --> 13:11.922
You have three days to find it.

13:12.380 --> 13:15.922
If you don't,
it will either be shipped out of town,

13:16.005 --> 13:18.713
or the chop shops
will have stripped it down to parts.

13:21.838 --> 13:24.088
But, they told me they would find it.

13:26.922 --> 13:28.838
They just say that.

13:29.755 --> 13:31.838
They won't make a move for three days.

13:35.422 --> 13:36.963
I know a guy.

13:37.505 --> 13:39.213
He can get it done.

13:41.588 --> 13:42.588
What does he charge?

13:45.380 --> 13:46.755
He's eccentric that way...

13:46.838 --> 13:49.838
If he likes you,
he may even do it for free.

14:00.422 --> 14:02.297
Mr. Patil, can I borrow your pen?

14:04.255 --> 14:06.380
Here, jot it down.

14:18.547 --> 14:20.963
He's avoided prison for 18 years.

14:21.047 --> 14:22.672
Wouldn't you call him an artist?

14:25.172 --> 14:26.338
Take me, for instance.

14:27.838 --> 14:29.588
This is my second time this month.

14:29.672 --> 14:31.005
Let's go. It's time.

14:31.088 --> 14:33.505
You think you own that pen?
Give it back to me.

14:34.088 --> 14:34.922
Let's go.

14:43.838 --> 14:47.463
<i>The women in our family</i>
<i>have a new WhatsApp group.</i>

14:47.547 --> 14:49.797
<i>Sahastrabuddhe Beauties.</i>

14:49.880 --> 14:52.297
<i>I put up a picture of you</i>
<i>and your new car.</i>

14:52.380 --> 14:54.463
<i>It's getting a lot of comments.</i>

14:54.547 --> 14:58.047
<i>We wanted to surprise you,</i>
<i>but I just have to tell you.</i>

14:58.130 --> 15:01.005
<i>Your dad and I are coming</i>

15:01.088 --> 15:05.963
-But, Mom--
-<i>But we can't stay very long.</i>

15:06.463 --> 15:09.713
<i>Your dad and I</i>
<i>are starting a keto diet on Monday.</i>

15:09.797 --> 15:12.630
<i>Make sure your read all the....</i>
<i>I'll hang up.</i>

16:24.088 --> 16:25.963
May I speak to Mr. Artist?

16:27.922 --> 16:30.672
My name is Nirma.

16:49.005 --> 16:51.713
I'm here
to check your internet connection.

16:56.922 --> 16:57.755
It's fine.

16:58.547 --> 16:59.713
Let me do it.

17:00.297 --> 17:01.588
It won't take too long.

18:21.297 --> 18:23.422
<i>All Chinese sauces</i>
<i>are so popular in India.</i>

18:23.505 --> 18:27.463
<i>You can use it with chicken,</i>
<i>cottage cheese.</i>

18:27.547 --> 18:30.172
<i>You can cook it with shrimp or fish.</i>

18:30.255 --> 18:33.463
<i>It goes with everything.</i>

18:34.005 --> 18:37.172
<i>Children are especially fond</i>
<i>of sweet and sour sauce.</i>

18:38.630 --> 18:43.422
<i>We'll be making this dish using fish.</i>

18:43.880 --> 18:48.463
<i>Here's what you need to do...</i>

18:48.547 --> 18:50.005
<i>The oil is heating up,</i>

18:51.088 --> 18:55.922
<i>meanwhile, let's prepare the sauce.</i>

18:56.255 --> 18:58.463
<i>The oil is heating up.</i>

18:58.672 --> 18:59.922
<i>Don't use too much oil.</i>

19:05.338 --> 19:10.922
<i>We then add some ginger and garlic.</i>

19:12.422 --> 19:14.297
<i>Now we add onions.</i>

19:15.172 --> 19:16.755
<i>And then...</i>

19:18.880 --> 19:21.297
<i>Now we add onions.</i>

19:23.422 --> 19:25.588
<i>And while this cooks,</i>

19:25.672 --> 19:28.838
<i>we will be taking a small break.</i>

19:29.255 --> 19:32.255
<i>See you after the break.</i>

19:34.213 --> 19:36.255
<i>Hello. I'm Sanjeev Kapoor.</i>

19:36.797 --> 19:38.880
<i>Do you want to become India's Super Chef?</i>

19:39.172 --> 19:40.255
<i>Then get ready.</i>

19:40.463 --> 19:43.797
<i>I'm headed to your city,</i>
<i>in search of the Super Chef.</i>

20:44.922 --> 20:46.630
Couldn't your parents
find you a better name?

20:49.130 --> 20:50.130
Excuse me?

20:52.213 --> 20:53.463
You're named after a detergent.

20:54.755 --> 20:59.588
Well, the day I was born...

21:00.255 --> 21:04.213
was the day my dad
got his Nirma detergent franchise.

21:04.297 --> 21:05.297
So...

21:05.547 --> 21:08.588
Good thing it wasn't an iPhone franchise.
He might have named you...

21:17.588 --> 21:19.672
Do you know the English name
for the <i>rawas </i>fish?

21:31.338 --> 21:32.172
Do you?

21:33.130 --> 21:34.422
It is...

21:39.547 --> 21:41.547
The "L" is silent. Did you study English?

21:45.088 --> 21:47.255
You should ask your school for a refund.

21:49.380 --> 21:54.130
But, it's been so long
that they will refuse.

22:06.672 --> 22:07.588
Hello.

22:08.880 --> 22:09.963
Mrs. Wu, how are you?

22:11.630 --> 22:13.838
You have a tummy ache?

22:15.297 --> 22:16.505
How?

22:16.588 --> 22:19.880
Oh, you should have asked
before eating Indian Chinese.

22:21.380 --> 22:23.088
I'm very sorry.

22:24.880 --> 22:26.130
We can't do that.

22:26.213 --> 22:30.297
We can't postpone tomorrow's trip.

22:30.380 --> 22:31.213
Thanks.

22:36.172 --> 22:38.005
Do you work at the Shaolin temple?

22:41.797 --> 22:43.088
No.

22:46.755 --> 22:47.963
A translator means--

22:48.047 --> 22:50.713
I know. I did go to high school,
and I learned English.

22:53.338 --> 22:54.338
What is Mandarin?

22:55.422 --> 22:56.755
It's a Chinese language.

22:57.588 --> 22:58.672
Why Chinese?

23:00.755 --> 23:03.505
I wanted to learn...

23:06.713 --> 23:09.088
or any other European language.

23:09.755 --> 23:12.380
But my dad said I should learn Chinese.

23:12.880 --> 23:14.880
It is the most populous country.

23:15.713 --> 23:17.463
He said it will always be in demand.

23:17.797 --> 23:20.297
And you really can't depend on Europe.

23:20.588 --> 23:23.713
They're fickle. They might even
start using another language.

23:25.672 --> 23:26.838
Do you speak it well?

23:27.963 --> 23:29.213
I'm okay at it.

23:30.005 --> 23:30.838
Can you cuss?

23:31.338 --> 23:32.255
Excuse me?

23:33.963 --> 23:34.922
Cuss in Chinese?

23:35.880 --> 23:37.588
I don't swear in any language.

23:39.630 --> 23:40.463
Is that so?

23:42.588 --> 23:46.963
Have you never said,
"Fuck, that's some great lamb"?

23:51.547 --> 23:55.297
Never said, "Fuck, I'm screwed today"?

23:58.255 --> 24:00.838
You've never used
the word "fuck" in anger?

24:06.213 --> 24:08.005
You won't help me now.

24:10.047 --> 24:12.588
Please help me.

24:12.672 --> 24:15.797
-Nothing else in this city belongs to me.
-Where was the car stolen?

24:16.130 --> 24:16.963
Huh?

24:17.797 --> 24:18.713
Your car.

24:19.463 --> 24:20.380
Where was it stolen?

24:21.422 --> 24:23.672
Near the Mahalakshmi temple.

24:23.755 --> 24:25.755
I went to ask for God's blessings.

24:25.838 --> 24:27.088
Do you still believe in God?

24:27.172 --> 24:30.047
It's not His fault.
I handed the keys to a thief.

24:36.422 --> 24:38.797
I'll text you on WhatsApp
about tomorrow's meeting.

24:40.463 --> 24:41.547
You need me?

24:43.005 --> 24:44.297
You are my ride.

24:45.172 --> 24:49.630
-But my car has been stolen.
-I couldn't possibly own a car?

24:51.130 --> 24:52.213
Of course, you could.

24:54.380 --> 24:55.880
What do I owe you?

25:30.922 --> 25:31.797
-Amit!
-Yes, sir?

25:31.880 --> 25:34.672
-Remove those tires.
-I'll do it after I dismantle the engine.

25:35.255 --> 25:38.297
Hello. Yes, yes.

25:39.422 --> 25:42.297
Tell me the license plate number.
The red one, right?

25:43.338 --> 25:45.047
Come in the evening. It'll be done.

25:45.130 --> 25:46.838
NASIK, PUNE, NAGPUR,
MUMBAI, THANE, JABALPUR

25:46.922 --> 25:49.047
-You know Shafiq, right?
-The...

25:50.088 --> 25:51.172
Yes, him.

25:51.755 --> 25:54.088
He went to enroll his son
at school yesterday.

25:55.088 --> 25:57.547
They asked the kid what he wanted to be
when he grew up.

25:57.630 --> 25:58.880
Do you know what he said?

26:02.255 --> 26:04.338
-Did he get enrolled?
-Fat chance.

26:04.922 --> 26:06.755
-But Shafiq is really happy.
-Really?

26:09.088 --> 26:11.422
Please stop this thing.

26:11.505 --> 26:14.213
...sir. Listen to me.

26:14.922 --> 26:18.005
I don't have any money,

26:18.380 --> 26:19.338
honestly.

26:19.922 --> 26:21.297
Please turn this thing off.

26:21.505 --> 26:23.005
I've been running for so long.

26:23.380 --> 26:25.672
Please turn it off.
I have a heart condition.

26:26.255 --> 26:28.880
...sir. I can't run anymore.

26:31.255 --> 26:32.380
Here's the thing.

26:33.505 --> 26:38.672
I never call anyone twice.
I have a reputation to protect.

26:38.755 --> 26:39.755
But, sir...

26:42.380 --> 26:44.713
I called you three times.

26:45.713 --> 26:46.963
You do have a good voice.

26:49.672 --> 26:51.088
You never answered my calls.

26:53.088 --> 26:54.422
Were you screwing someone?

26:55.172 --> 26:58.088
Gosh! No, sir. What are you saying?

26:58.505 --> 27:02.005
I was really busy at work.

27:02.255 --> 27:05.130
I mean, I was busy looking for a job,

27:05.547 --> 27:06.380
honestly.

27:06.880 --> 27:10.005
You bought a three-bedroom apartment
in Lokhandwala last month.

27:10.088 --> 27:12.463
No... I mean, I did but...

27:12.963 --> 27:16.797
I spent everything on the décor.
I have nothing left, honestly.

27:16.880 --> 27:20.297
You're a playback singer,
a judge on <i>Little Champs.</i>

27:20.922 --> 27:22.422
You do live shows abroad.

27:23.213 --> 27:25.380
Yet you have nothing left for me?

27:26.213 --> 27:28.380
Honestly, sir. I'm flat broke.

27:28.463 --> 27:31.297
Sir... don't increase the speed.

27:31.380 --> 27:32.338
Please, sir.

27:32.422 --> 27:34.755
-I'm exhausted.
-Boss?

27:34.838 --> 27:36.797
-Sir...
-Bitliya is here.

27:36.880 --> 27:40.047
Sir, sir...

27:41.672 --> 27:43.630
Did you feed chocolate to Bahubali?

27:43.713 --> 27:44.630
Yes, boss.

27:44.963 --> 27:46.588
Haven't you read his diet chart?

27:47.630 --> 27:49.380
Next month, he has his 100th fight.

27:49.463 --> 27:51.088
Chocolate will weaken his bones.

27:51.922 --> 27:55.463
Sir, I'm illiterate, so--

27:55.547 --> 27:56.922
You can't read?

27:58.380 --> 28:01.297
Asshole, the government keeps telling you,

28:01.380 --> 28:03.255
"Education is the path to success."

28:03.338 --> 28:04.297
Yet, here you are.

28:06.172 --> 28:07.922
...boss. It was a mistake.

28:08.005 --> 28:09.172
I won't do it again.

28:09.505 --> 28:11.547
Please, boss. Forgive me.

28:11.630 --> 28:13.797
I won't do it again. Please forgive me.

28:14.047 --> 28:16.047
I won't give anyone chocolate anymore.

28:16.130 --> 28:19.338
I won't eat it either. I am an asshole.

28:19.422 --> 28:22.755
Boss, boss...

28:27.672 --> 28:31.047
Sir, please let me go.

28:32.130 --> 28:37.088
I swear on Bahubali,
I will pray for his victory every day.

28:37.672 --> 28:38.505
...sir.

28:40.172 --> 28:41.088
Fine.

28:42.338 --> 28:43.338
You don't have to pay.

28:43.838 --> 28:45.213
Really, sir?

28:50.130 --> 28:51.713
In exchange,

28:52.505 --> 28:54.047
sing me my favorite song.

29:07.755 --> 29:11.338
<i>Life is a beautiful journey</i>

29:11.422 --> 29:15.088
<i>Who knows what tomorrow will bring</i>

29:15.172 --> 29:18.672
<i>Life is a beautiful journey</i>

29:18.755 --> 29:22.422
<i>Who knows what tomorrow will bring</i>

29:32.463 --> 29:35.963
Sorry, sir.
I'm off-key without my harmonium.

30:37.380 --> 30:38.463
Hey, look.

31:58.505 --> 32:00.797
Mr. Zaveri has spent a fortune on this.

32:02.172 --> 32:03.005
Sir,

32:03.505 --> 32:05.130
that's why we brought it to you.

32:05.922 --> 32:07.297
It's a brand new model.

32:12.547 --> 32:13.463
Manual?

32:16.130 --> 32:18.422
Sir, it's Good Friday.
Manuel is at church.

32:19.255 --> 32:22.797
Dumbass,
I meant the manual for this model.

32:23.755 --> 32:24.588
I have it.

32:33.213 --> 32:36.005
Sir, it's in...

32:38.963 --> 32:41.047
Yeah, Mom. I know I keep putting you off.

32:41.130 --> 32:43.047
-But I am very busy.
-Sweet timing!

32:43.130 --> 32:46.380
No, please don't come next weekend.
I'll let you know.

32:47.380 --> 32:49.630
Okay. I'll call you later.

33:03.797 --> 33:06.047
Translate it into words
that I can understand.

33:13.422 --> 33:17.338
"This safe is unbreakable."

33:18.588 --> 33:19.672
It says...

34:31.213 --> 34:33.547
-Count this.
-Look at this.

34:33.630 --> 34:35.172
Look, the box is open.

34:35.255 --> 34:37.797
It will fetch a good price.

34:37.963 --> 34:39.797
-How much will this get?
-At least 100,000 rupees.

34:40.213 --> 34:41.838
This? How much will this fetch?

34:44.547 --> 34:45.838
Count this as well.

34:45.922 --> 34:47.422
How much is this worth?

34:47.505 --> 34:49.338
There's more. Wait.

34:49.880 --> 34:51.422
Wait... which stone is this?

34:51.922 --> 34:55.380
-Is this sapphire?
-Wow! Look at the way it shines.

34:55.880 --> 34:57.213
Take the keys and bring the car.

35:05.213 --> 35:08.213
-Is this your family photo?
-It's the Godrej Locks Company family.

35:12.463 --> 35:15.047
For 18 years,
I've been opening the locks they make.

35:15.213 --> 35:16.630
I feel we have a connection now.

35:28.755 --> 35:29.755
It's a...

35:33.755 --> 35:35.463
Can you break any lock?

35:37.130 --> 35:38.172
"Break"?

35:39.880 --> 35:42.588
Every lock has a heart.
I listen to the heartbeat.

35:49.755 --> 35:51.297
Your dog is pretty cute.

35:52.047 --> 35:53.088
What's his name?

36:03.755 --> 36:05.130
I had another, smaller dog.

36:13.755 --> 36:14.630
Where's he?

36:15.297 --> 36:16.213
He died...

36:16.880 --> 36:17.713
because of...

36:18.922 --> 36:20.880
Small Pox had cholera?

36:21.880 --> 36:23.672
...was the name of my third dog.

36:34.672 --> 36:36.505
Have you ever stolen a car?

36:37.588 --> 36:40.922
Does an ophthalmologist
perform heart surgery?

36:41.922 --> 36:44.130
-No.
-We work by the same rule.

36:47.338 --> 36:48.672
Ever stolen anything?

36:49.755 --> 36:51.338
No. Never.

36:52.380 --> 36:53.630
It's just a matter of...

36:54.463 --> 36:55.463
Excuse me?

36:56.338 --> 36:59.380
Everyone steals at some point.
You will too.

37:10.630 --> 37:12.213
What's causing this traffic jam?

37:13.713 --> 37:15.005
What's going on here?

37:15.088 --> 37:16.713
What a menace.

37:21.380 --> 37:23.297
What is the problem with these guys.

37:29.338 --> 37:31.213
Even the police aren't helping.

37:31.297 --> 37:33.505
How long will this continue.

37:36.797 --> 37:38.838
It's been at a standstill for 15 minutes.

37:56.755 --> 37:58.713
This is too much. We're running late.

38:17.797 --> 38:20.463
Why in the middle of the road?
Go to an arena.

38:25.505 --> 38:27.922
Why did you stop? Keep playing.

39:24.088 --> 39:25.713
Who played the National Anthem?

39:26.255 --> 39:29.297
Let's go. We can't play anything
after the nation anthem.

39:29.380 --> 39:31.338
Let's go. Let's go.

39:31.755 --> 39:34.255
-That was a great...
-Who thought it up?

39:34.338 --> 39:36.547
It was the idea of that guy in the...

39:36.922 --> 39:38.505
Come on, let's go.

39:38.588 --> 39:39.463
Look at the politician's face.

39:39.547 --> 39:41.797
They'll hit me with shoes
if I have the band play again.

39:41.880 --> 39:42.713
Let's go.

39:43.422 --> 39:45.005
We're causing a traffic jam.

39:45.422 --> 39:47.380
We're causing a traffic jam.

39:49.922 --> 39:52.755
The traffic's finally cleared.

39:53.797 --> 39:55.213
They learned a lesson.

39:55.297 --> 39:57.297
-Come on, hurry up.
-That took so long.

39:58.130 --> 39:59.713
That was really tiring.

40:00.088 --> 40:01.213
Come on, hurry up!

40:14.630 --> 40:16.255
ENGLISH LIQUOR STORE

40:38.838 --> 40:39.797
Where are we going?

40:55.255 --> 40:57.547
-Did you attend the party yesterday?
-Of course.

40:57.630 --> 40:59.213
-Was it fun.
-It was great.

40:59.297 --> 41:00.338
What's up, Artist?

41:04.672 --> 41:06.463
You said we were going to the CBI.

41:07.588 --> 41:08.422
Chillar....

41:11.255 --> 41:12.630
PATKAR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

41:14.797 --> 41:17.130
The guy has high connections,
like all ministers.

41:17.213 --> 41:18.255
Why do you look so happy?

41:19.297 --> 41:21.797
This picture looks just like you,
but it's not you.

42:17.922 --> 42:22.880
WHEN EVERY CHILD GOES TO SCHOOL,
NO CHILD IS LEFT BEHIND

42:25.672 --> 42:28.588
Ironically,
these kids are actually in a school.

42:45.922 --> 42:48.380
Where does all that loose change
come from?

42:50.213 --> 42:51.713
Who has the most loose change?

42:54.755 --> 42:55.755
Beggars?

42:58.713 --> 43:00.088
You are not as dumb as you look.

43:05.755 --> 43:08.047
These people get loose change from them.

43:09.338 --> 43:12.797
The government offers 100 rupees
in exchange for 90 rupees in coins.

43:14.547 --> 43:15.755
That's it?

43:16.880 --> 43:18.755
Do you know how much they make in a day?

43:20.588 --> 43:23.797
They spend 10,000 rupees a month
on sewing supplies and rubber bands.

43:26.547 --> 43:29.005
Why are they working without clothes on?

43:30.463 --> 43:31.297
For...

43:32.213 --> 43:36.088
If they're not wearing clothes,
they have nowhere to hide things.

43:36.422 --> 43:37.672
Mr. UK!

43:38.172 --> 43:39.172
Artist, bro...

43:40.338 --> 43:41.672
He's a dear friend of mine.

43:46.963 --> 43:48.005
Udan Khatola.

43:48.213 --> 43:50.630
Artist, bro!

43:50.713 --> 43:51.588
How are you?

43:51.713 --> 43:53.755
-All good?
-Great. Couldn't be better.

44:02.172 --> 44:04.297
I've never sat on a pile of money before.

44:14.505 --> 44:16.047
Call for tea.

44:17.047 --> 44:17.922
Tea.

44:20.630 --> 44:22.213
Damn it! Go!

44:24.797 --> 44:26.463
These scum are a real problem.

44:29.130 --> 44:29.963
What's up?

44:30.922 --> 44:31.963
It's a little thing.

44:33.880 --> 44:37.630
Two days ago, her i10 was stolen
near the Mahalakshmi temple.

44:44.297 --> 44:45.130
How?

44:46.088 --> 44:49.213
I gave it to a parking attendant...

44:49.547 --> 44:50.713
What's the plate number?

44:59.588 --> 45:01.047
My vehicle is the best.

45:08.297 --> 45:10.797
Don't worry.
I'll call you as soon as I know anything.

45:16.963 --> 45:17.922
Have some tea.

45:18.297 --> 45:19.255
No, I have to go.

45:19.338 --> 45:20.588
Have some tea first.

45:20.672 --> 45:21.672
No, no.

45:22.130 --> 45:23.172
Got to go now.

45:23.297 --> 45:25.588
If you hear anything from your boys,
let me know?

45:25.672 --> 45:27.297
Next time, I won't let you go.

45:28.463 --> 45:31.047
What was that dish
you brought me last time?

45:32.797 --> 45:33.713
Lasun...

45:34.963 --> 45:35.838
Yeah.

45:38.255 --> 45:40.088
It was delicious. Scrumptious.

45:40.880 --> 45:42.713
I brought you something Indian today.

45:43.797 --> 45:45.213
Take a trip to Manali.

45:50.213 --> 45:52.088
Bro, I feel your love.

45:57.505 --> 46:00.505
...if I solve your problem,
will I get a discount on detergent?

46:07.213 --> 46:09.047
That guy is going to find my car?

46:09.547 --> 46:11.838
The beggars near the temple will do it.

46:12.588 --> 46:14.547
When they have information,
we'll get a WhatsApp message.

46:15.380 --> 46:19.380
Do the beggars have phones?

46:21.922 --> 46:23.338
What kind of phone do you have?

46:25.713 --> 46:26.755
They have the iPhone 7.

46:38.547 --> 46:41.755
-Seems like Bahubali wants to live here.
-He's settled in nicely.

46:45.963 --> 46:49.672
<i>Life is a beautiful journey</i>

46:49.963 --> 46:53.630
<i>Who knows what tomorrow will bring</i>

46:53.880 --> 46:57.672
<i>Life is a beautiful journey</i>

46:57.880 --> 47:02.130
<i>Who knows what tomorrow will bring</i>

47:07.422 --> 47:08.422
<i>Stop!</i>

47:09.630 --> 47:12.797
I paid 2.1 million rupees for Bahubali.

47:13.130 --> 47:16.588
Are you trying to give him indigestion
with these cheap tomatoes?

47:16.880 --> 47:18.297
How will he perform at the fight?

47:21.588 --> 47:24.963
Boss. We have to deliver four i10s
to Uttarakhand. But...

47:26.547 --> 47:27.422
But what?

47:27.963 --> 47:30.088
Bahubali has become attached to one car.

47:30.588 --> 47:32.088
He won't step out of it.

47:33.505 --> 47:34.547
Then keep it.

47:34.963 --> 47:37.463
Never anger a fighter before the fight.

47:38.047 --> 47:39.422
-Right?
-Okay, boss.

47:39.505 --> 47:40.338
Keep it.

47:41.547 --> 47:42.380
Sing!

48:33.005 --> 48:34.172
But...

49:14.213 --> 49:16.672
We need to meet a guy
at Andheri station at 9.

49:26.797 --> 49:28.713
What's wrong? Is Jackie Chan dead?

49:34.380 --> 49:35.797
Today, at work...

49:42.755 --> 49:46.713
I have to quit my job. That's my only...

50:01.547 --> 50:02.547
No other...

50:11.463 --> 50:12.297
No.

50:12.380 --> 50:13.838
No, no!

50:20.130 --> 50:22.213
I'm creating the situation you described.

50:22.963 --> 50:23.922
According to you,

50:24.005 --> 50:26.505
if we jumped off this roof,
there's no way we'd survive.

50:26.755 --> 50:28.922
-Right?
-What are you doing?

50:32.172 --> 50:33.338
What are you...

50:34.255 --> 50:35.547
Just answer my question.

50:38.172 --> 50:42.588
According to you, if we jumped from here,
we're dead for sure.

50:42.672 --> 50:44.338
-Yes or no?
-No, no, no.

50:44.422 --> 50:45.338
No...

50:54.922 --> 50:56.422
I said jump.

50:57.005 --> 50:58.422
We can always jump backwards.

51:00.713 --> 51:03.588
Whatever the situation,
there are always options.

51:19.713 --> 51:21.588
Yes, Murtuza. We are here.

51:26.047 --> 51:27.713
Sure. We'll wait here.

51:52.713 --> 51:53.838
...sir.

51:54.963 --> 51:56.255
I made you wait a bit.

51:57.172 --> 52:00.005
-These are my working hours, you know.
-That's all right.

52:00.088 --> 52:01.963
Business comes first.

52:02.672 --> 52:05.922
Mr. Udan Khatola said
it was about a close friend of his.

52:06.422 --> 52:07.797
He really does respect you.

52:09.838 --> 52:11.005
...do you recognize me?

52:11.922 --> 52:13.130
We've met before.

52:15.172 --> 52:17.380
-Yes.
-That's why we're meeting you again today.

52:17.672 --> 52:19.047
Come on, bro.

52:22.380 --> 52:23.755
I caused you trouble.

52:25.172 --> 52:26.005
No...

52:28.463 --> 52:30.505
But why did you take my car...

52:31.088 --> 52:33.797
I mean, you have such a lovely car.

52:34.047 --> 52:34.963
What, this one?

52:35.047 --> 52:36.213
I just got this one.

52:37.547 --> 52:38.380
From the showroom?

52:38.880 --> 52:39.713
No.

52:44.963 --> 52:46.463
This one will go to Vashi tomorrow.

52:46.713 --> 52:50.463
To the Vasant Vihar Society building,
near the toll plaza.

52:50.755 --> 52:52.380
Gol Bandya has a mechanic shop there.

52:52.463 --> 52:53.838
All the cars I boost go there.

52:54.463 --> 52:55.713
That's where her i10 is.

52:58.172 --> 52:59.255
Why thank me?

52:59.338 --> 53:00.380
It's your car.

53:01.963 --> 53:06.838
I think you should give Gol Bandya
a mobile phone in exchange.

53:07.047 --> 53:08.422
He won't like it otherwise.

53:09.005 --> 53:10.713
We'll buy him the best.

53:18.838 --> 53:21.255
It won't matter
if the paint is a little chipped.

53:21.338 --> 53:23.255
It can be touched up.

53:24.422 --> 53:25.630
...we found my car.

53:27.797 --> 53:30.422
I can't believe all that's happened
in these two days.

53:30.505 --> 53:33.422
I saw a safe being cracked,
I stood on a roof ledge,

53:33.505 --> 53:35.047
and I rode in a stolen car.

53:35.547 --> 53:37.297
I'm not afraid of anything anymore.

53:45.088 --> 53:47.755
-Buy a good one.
-No. I have a card.

53:48.130 --> 53:49.338
You can return it later.

53:51.088 --> 53:52.005
What about you?

54:15.755 --> 54:16.713
I'll take this one.

54:50.213 --> 54:51.255
Try this one.

54:55.922 --> 54:57.088
That's fake currency.

55:29.713 --> 55:31.172
Please wait up.

56:16.838 --> 56:17.755
Lost your fear?

56:20.172 --> 56:21.380
Those bills were not fake.

56:34.338 --> 56:38.213
I think I must have been
10 or 12 years old.

56:39.047 --> 56:42.797
I was treated for about a year and a half,

56:42.880 --> 56:44.838
until I finally overcame my stutter.

56:45.880 --> 56:49.380
I had to see a speech therapist
two or three times a week.

56:50.213 --> 56:51.713
A speech therapist is...

56:55.505 --> 56:59.297
I had to practice speaking
with balls in my mouth.

57:02.713 --> 57:03.630
What is it?

57:03.713 --> 57:06.838
In my profession,
that means something entirely different.

57:17.172 --> 57:18.255
Can I ask you a question?

57:21.130 --> 57:23.755
Why do you see everything
in black and white?

57:25.630 --> 57:26.463
Well...

57:28.422 --> 57:30.922
Everyone does.
They just don't acknowledge it.

57:43.255 --> 57:45.588
I know why you didn't let me drive today.

57:46.630 --> 57:49.297
Because, on the way back,
I'll be driving my own car.

57:50.172 --> 57:52.130
But this is a dead end.

57:52.963 --> 57:55.172
That's why Gol Bandya
has his chop shop here.

58:38.672 --> 58:39.547
It's over there.

1:00:19.880 --> 1:00:21.630
Okay, fine.

1:00:23.047 --> 1:00:24.463
No, your name won't come up.

1:00:25.422 --> 1:00:27.338
I told you, I won't drag you into it.

1:00:27.755 --> 1:00:28.838
I give you my word.

1:00:28.922 --> 1:00:30.005
Go on, hang up.

1:00:30.713 --> 1:00:31.713
Yes, hang up.

1:00:33.838 --> 1:00:35.672
You were absolutely right.

1:00:36.463 --> 1:00:38.838
That bastard, Murtuza, lied to us.

1:00:40.422 --> 1:00:42.505
He didn't deliver the car to Gol Bandya.

1:00:42.880 --> 1:00:44.630
He gave it to Fayyaz, the gangster.

1:01:02.297 --> 1:01:03.838
ABODE OF MERCY

1:01:30.797 --> 1:01:31.713
Juice.

1:01:41.088 --> 1:01:42.338
Boss, they say it's good.

1:01:48.380 --> 1:01:50.797
As I said on the phone

1:01:51.172 --> 1:01:52.838
they are from <i>Animal Planet</i>.

1:01:53.130 --> 1:01:55.547
They're making a documentary

1:01:56.422 --> 1:01:58.172
on animal fights, around the world.

1:02:21.463 --> 1:02:22.380
"Bahu"...

1:02:23.547 --> 1:02:24.630
"Bahu"...

1:02:25.672 --> 1:02:26.505
..."bali"...

1:02:35.630 --> 1:02:36.630
Who the hell is Neil?

1:02:38.547 --> 1:02:39.838
The actor Neil Nitin Mukesh.

1:02:50.047 --> 1:02:53.963
Boss, they want to get some footage
of Bahubali.

1:02:58.047 --> 1:02:59.463
That's good news.

1:03:03.338 --> 1:03:05.130
Publish it in our community paper.

1:03:05.213 --> 1:03:08.130
-Okay, boss.
-Our fighter has become a star.

1:03:08.213 --> 1:03:09.130
Yes, boss.

1:03:58.255 --> 1:04:00.422
...I need to check your Wi-Fi connection.

1:04:59.463 --> 1:05:04.047
Last month, HR informed me
I have many vacation days pending.

1:05:38.797 --> 1:05:39.797
Do you have change?

1:05:45.005 --> 1:05:45.880
Where?

1:05:57.130 --> 1:05:59.713
BAHUBALI BECOMES A SUPERSTAR

1:06:25.797 --> 1:06:28.797
You knew my car was okay,
but you didn't tell me!

1:06:29.755 --> 1:06:31.880
That man beside the car - do you know him?

1:06:31.963 --> 1:06:33.005
I don't care who he is.

1:06:33.172 --> 1:06:35.630
The car beside him is mine.

1:07:08.672 --> 1:07:12.547
You were the one who told me
there's always another choice.

1:07:28.963 --> 1:07:30.755
BAHUBALI BECOMES A SUPERSTAR

1:07:32.088 --> 1:07:34.672
How can you be certain that is your car?

1:07:35.088 --> 1:07:37.255
Look at this... I put it there.

1:07:37.672 --> 1:07:39.630
And the sticker proves it's your car?

1:07:40.213 --> 1:07:42.422
I am telling you, this is my car.

1:07:42.505 --> 1:07:45.213
I tore a corner when I put it on.

1:07:47.713 --> 1:07:49.880
Practically every car has a sticker on it.

1:07:50.130 --> 1:07:52.630
That's not evidence
to start an investigation.

1:07:57.922 --> 1:07:58.880
You're right.

1:08:00.130 --> 1:08:02.588
But if I'd been
the Commissioner's daughter,

1:08:02.672 --> 1:08:04.547
would you be using the same logic on her?

1:08:16.797 --> 1:08:19.255
Please aim the pepper spray
properly this time.

1:08:28.297 --> 1:08:29.380
How did you get in?

1:08:30.338 --> 1:08:32.047
You're asking <i>me </i>that question?

1:08:51.922 --> 1:08:53.338
You have a stain...

1:08:55.422 --> 1:08:56.297
on your shirt.

1:08:59.713 --> 1:09:01.422
Very well spotted, Ms. Detergent.

1:09:05.380 --> 1:09:06.505
We have one option.

1:09:49.672 --> 1:09:50.672
Congratulations, boss.

1:09:57.713 --> 1:09:58.838
Chop it up finely.

1:10:01.380 --> 1:10:03.755
Mr. Artist,
how is your <i>biryani</i> shaping up?

1:10:03.838 --> 1:10:06.505
It's coming along great, Farooq.

1:10:07.172 --> 1:10:08.880
Smells delicious.

1:10:15.463 --> 1:10:18.422
-How is your father doing?
-He's very well.

1:10:18.505 --> 1:10:19.505
And your...

1:10:26.130 --> 1:10:27.672
-Call the caterer.
-Okay, sir.

1:10:31.963 --> 1:10:33.505
There's magic in your hands.

1:10:34.713 --> 1:10:37.130
-The boss wants to see you.
-I'll be back.

1:10:38.880 --> 1:10:40.672
I want to open a shop in Bhiwandi.

1:10:41.463 --> 1:10:43.797
Near the highway. It will be good.

1:10:43.880 --> 1:10:44.755
Keep an eye out.

1:10:45.213 --> 1:10:46.172
Sir.

1:10:47.880 --> 1:10:48.963
See me before you go.

1:10:50.963 --> 1:10:53.130
You cooked lamb on Bahubali's birthday?

1:10:53.922 --> 1:10:54.755
Yes, sir.

1:10:58.422 --> 1:11:01.297
How will he feel when he sees
his relatives being served up on plates?

1:11:07.463 --> 1:11:09.713
Hey, do it properly.
Who do you think you are?

1:11:10.005 --> 1:11:11.047
All well, Farooq?

1:11:11.463 --> 1:11:13.338
He humiliated me in public.

1:11:13.422 --> 1:11:14.672
The old man's lost it.

1:11:15.922 --> 1:11:17.963
He wants to make his goat a celebrity.

1:11:18.547 --> 1:11:19.463
Serve the <i>biryani</i>!

1:11:19.547 --> 1:11:21.297
I hear someone's making a film
about the goat.

1:11:21.380 --> 1:11:26.630
That lunatic has called someone from
a beauty parlor to do the goat's makeup.

1:11:26.922 --> 1:11:27.755
Insanity.

1:11:27.838 --> 1:11:29.172
Serve the bread.

1:11:50.672 --> 1:11:53.672
Please come, buy some fresh meat.

1:12:33.672 --> 1:12:35.005
Come on, come on, come on.

1:12:39.963 --> 1:12:43.380
This is great. We meet again, so soon.

1:12:44.755 --> 1:12:48.047
I just felt like doing the rounds
of the market.

1:12:48.880 --> 1:12:51.213
-He looks meaty.
-Yes.

1:12:54.297 --> 1:12:56.047
He has three toes.

1:12:56.713 --> 1:12:57.838
It's a miracle.

1:12:57.922 --> 1:12:59.713
Such goats bring luck.

1:13:00.047 --> 1:13:02.505
We sure do need some...

1:13:04.130 --> 1:13:06.338
-See you. I need to finish loading up.
-Okay.

1:13:28.547 --> 1:13:30.547
TAKE ACTION, IF YOU DARE

1:13:30.630 --> 1:13:32.255
IF NOT, ENDURE

1:13:38.130 --> 1:13:38.963
Yes?

1:13:40.588 --> 1:13:42.547
They called me to do makeup.

1:13:42.922 --> 1:13:43.755
Come in.

1:13:58.505 --> 1:13:59.338
This way.

1:14:12.630 --> 1:14:13.505
Wait here.

1:14:34.047 --> 1:14:35.297
Hey, Ms. Beauty Parlor.

1:14:38.922 --> 1:14:42.213
Hey, man. What are you doing?
Hurry up and deal the cards.

1:14:43.005 --> 1:14:47.713
The queen evaded me in this game,
otherwise I was going to win.

1:14:48.922 --> 1:14:50.547
Shuffle it properly.

1:15:02.672 --> 1:15:06.172
-Is he dangerous?
-Not at all. He's as docile as a cow.

1:15:06.630 --> 1:15:08.713
Do a good job. Make the boss happy.

1:15:11.047 --> 1:15:14.588
I need some hot water in a bowl.

1:16:50.547 --> 1:16:52.880
-Open the door.
-It has a padlock.

1:16:58.130 --> 1:16:59.005
What are you doing?

1:17:00.047 --> 1:17:02.130
You said every lock has a heart.

1:17:02.547 --> 1:17:04.630
-I'm trying to hear its--
-Don't even try.

1:17:06.172 --> 1:17:07.130
Got a hairpin?

1:17:07.922 --> 1:17:08.755
Yes.

1:17:08.838 --> 1:17:09.797
Put it in the keyhole.

1:17:12.713 --> 1:17:13.547
Now what?

1:17:14.755 --> 1:17:15.838
Leave it to fate.

1:18:18.880 --> 1:18:20.130
Call me when you're done.

1:18:26.338 --> 1:18:27.172
Yes, man.

1:18:30.630 --> 1:18:31.547
I am in for ten.

1:18:32.005 --> 1:18:33.630
-His move.
-Five from me, blind.

1:18:33.880 --> 1:18:34.963
I am in for five too.

1:18:36.838 --> 1:18:40.963
The makeup will take
about half an hour to set.

1:18:41.588 --> 1:18:44.047
-Please don't touch him until then.
-Okay.

1:18:47.047 --> 1:18:47.880
Listen...

1:18:50.088 --> 1:18:51.255
The door is this way.

1:18:52.422 --> 1:18:53.672
Five from me.

1:18:53.963 --> 1:18:56.047
-I am in for blind.
-Me too. Do it over.

1:19:39.213 --> 1:19:40.380
You were right.

1:19:41.463 --> 1:19:44.255
Everyone steals something
at some point in their life.

1:20:15.630 --> 1:20:19.297
<i>My heart soars like a kite</i>

1:20:20.380 --> 1:20:23.422
<i>Colored by a rainbow</i>

1:20:24.047 --> 1:20:29.630
<i>The skies open up</i>

1:20:29.713 --> 1:20:32.630
<i>I find clouds</i>

1:20:34.297 --> 1:20:37.422
<i>That enchant me</i>

1:20:37.505 --> 1:20:41.630
<i>I don't know where I'm headed</i>

1:20:43.213 --> 1:20:46.213
<i>It's a secret I can't fathom</i>

1:20:47.422 --> 1:20:50.797
<i>I don't recognize myself</i>

1:20:51.130 --> 1:20:53.005
<i>This heart of mine</i>

1:20:55.338 --> 1:20:56.713
<i>Has become a stranger</i>

1:21:04.213 --> 1:21:07.255
We should make the call now.

1:21:10.380 --> 1:21:14.047
<i>Death is inevitable, it will come one day</i>

1:21:14.297 --> 1:21:17.797
<i>Life will fade away,</i>
<i>It will happen one day</i>

1:21:17.880 --> 1:21:21.547
<i>Why fear such things</i>

1:21:21.630 --> 1:21:23.297
<i>Who knows what tomorrow--</i>

1:21:23.380 --> 1:21:24.213
Stop!

1:21:27.963 --> 1:21:28.922
<i>I have Bahubali.</i>

1:21:29.005 --> 1:21:31.088
You have no idea
what you're getting into--

1:21:32.463 --> 1:21:34.922
<i>Listen to me closely.</i>

1:21:35.005 --> 1:21:38.213
<i>Or the next time you see Bahubali,</i>
<i>he will be floating in sauce.</i>

1:21:39.713 --> 1:21:44.255
<i>I want you to return the i10 you stole</i>
<i>near the Mahalakshmi temple.</i>

1:22:04.547 --> 1:22:05.963
<i>Sir, do you want me to sing?</i>

1:22:07.380 --> 1:22:08.338
Bloody hell!

1:22:14.547 --> 1:22:15.463
ABODE OF MERCY

1:22:34.380 --> 1:22:35.838
Please pay me today.

1:22:44.422 --> 1:22:46.172
What's this goat doing here?

1:22:50.297 --> 1:22:55.047
This guy steals a Mercedes
from Fayyaz Qureshi...

1:22:57.797 --> 1:22:59.547
All he wants in exchange is an i10.

1:23:03.213 --> 1:23:04.713
Whoever he is...

1:23:06.088 --> 1:23:07.422
he's a lunatic.

1:23:13.588 --> 1:23:14.713
Boss.

1:23:19.422 --> 1:23:20.713
That's all I know, sir.

1:23:22.547 --> 1:23:23.463
Honestly.

1:23:27.880 --> 1:23:29.380
Where does this Artist live?

1:23:30.672 --> 1:23:33.422
I don't know, sir.
He's just an acquaintance.

1:24:02.338 --> 1:24:04.505
-Yes, tell me.
-Mr. Artist?

1:24:20.672 --> 1:24:23.172
Hey, UK. I need a ticket immediately.

1:24:28.172 --> 1:24:29.630
...you aren't the only goat here.

1:24:30.422 --> 1:24:32.422
I too have eaten grass all my life.

1:24:33.380 --> 1:24:38.172
The difference is, you're a fighting goat
and I am a scapegoat.

1:24:45.130 --> 1:24:48.255
Pack your bags in ten minutes,
and meet me at CST station.

1:24:48.672 --> 1:24:49.672
Where are we going?

1:24:49.755 --> 1:24:52.005
Not us. Just you. Back to your parents.

1:24:55.672 --> 1:24:56.672
What about Bahubali?

1:24:57.380 --> 1:24:58.505
I'll take care of him.

1:24:59.630 --> 1:25:00.963
They are onto us.

1:25:02.338 --> 1:25:05.547
<i>It's not just about the car anymore.</i>
<i>It's gotten serious.</i>

1:25:35.630 --> 1:25:37.297
You live off loose change, right?

1:25:38.713 --> 1:25:39.755
Now, eat it.

1:25:47.838 --> 1:25:48.713
Let's go.

1:27:35.380 --> 1:27:37.588
-Where were you?
-I've been looking all over for you.

1:27:39.047 --> 1:27:40.797
-Where does it arrive?
-Platform two.

1:27:41.130 --> 1:27:42.130
See you.

1:28:00.797 --> 1:28:04.797
<i>The number you have dialed</i>
<i>has either been switched off or--</i>

1:28:23.255 --> 1:28:24.505
There he is!

1:29:04.172 --> 1:29:06.463
Search there! Boss is going...

1:29:07.755 --> 1:29:09.005
What are you people doing?

1:29:09.797 --> 1:29:11.213
Listen to me. Okay.

1:29:11.755 --> 1:29:13.088
Hey. What is it?

1:29:15.213 --> 1:29:16.797
Hey, listen!

1:29:20.130 --> 1:29:21.255
Hang up.

1:29:27.172 --> 1:29:28.880
When you find him, bring him here.

1:29:31.755 --> 1:29:32.713
Call me.

1:29:42.130 --> 1:29:46.005
<i>Death is inevitable</i>

1:29:46.088 --> 1:29:49.713
<i>It will happen someday</i>

1:29:49.797 --> 1:29:53.880
<i>Life will fade</i>

1:29:54.088 --> 1:29:57.422
<i>It will happen someday</i>

1:29:58.838 --> 1:30:02.380
<i>Why fear such things</i>

1:30:02.463 --> 1:30:06.047
<i>There's no need to be afraid</i>

1:30:07.172 --> 1:30:11.547
<i>No one knows</i>

1:30:11.630 --> 1:30:14.672
<i>What tomorrow will bring</i>

1:30:15.630 --> 1:30:21.005
<i>No one knows</i>

1:30:21.088 --> 1:30:25.005
<i>What tomorrow will bring</i>

1:30:42.088 --> 1:30:42.922
Boss.

1:31:28.880 --> 1:31:30.963
It wasn't my intention to hurt you...

1:31:33.088 --> 1:31:35.005
or to humiliate you.

1:31:36.922 --> 1:31:39.213
I just wanted you to realize how it feels

1:31:40.630 --> 1:31:46.297
when someone steals an object
you love dearly.

1:31:50.672 --> 1:31:52.922
I know you're very angry.

1:31:54.838 --> 1:31:58.463
That's exactly how I felt
when I realized someone had stolen my car.

1:32:02.463 --> 1:32:04.047
I bought it that very day.

1:32:07.213 --> 1:32:09.005
Even the police wouldn't help me.

1:32:09.088 --> 1:32:10.505
And convincing you was...

1:32:13.755 --> 1:32:15.297
That's why we took Bahubali...

1:32:23.172 --> 1:32:27.713
But then I realized
that he's not an object,

1:32:29.130 --> 1:32:30.213
he's like your child.

1:32:33.088 --> 1:32:34.838
I just lost my car.

1:32:36.672 --> 1:32:38.505
It's all right if I don't get it back.

1:32:49.922 --> 1:32:51.130
Give me her car keys.

1:33:22.463 --> 1:33:23.297
It's for...

1:33:58.047 --> 1:34:00.172
Nirma took everyone to the cleaners today.

1:34:19.505 --> 1:34:21.338
Bahubali will not fight anymore.

1:34:33.713 --> 1:34:36.130
Please remove these... from the seats.

1:34:36.880 --> 1:34:39.505
-Where do you want to go?
-Where my fate leads me.

1:35:03.338 --> 1:35:04.213
You're an idiot.

1:35:08.005 --> 1:35:09.588
Now I can cuss in...

1:35:23.713 --> 1:35:24.588
Hey, listen.

1:35:25.713 --> 1:35:28.505
Don't forget to invite me
to your restaurant opening.

1:36:13.005 --> 1:36:16.213
<i>I find something new inside of me</i>

1:36:17.588 --> 1:36:20.755
<i>Something has changed</i>

1:36:20.838 --> 1:36:24.172
<i>What is happening to me?</i>

1:36:25.672 --> 1:36:28.797
<i>I find something new inside of me</i>

1:36:30.255 --> 1:36:33.172
<i>Something has changed</i>

1:36:33.672 --> 1:36:37.463
<i>What is happening to me?</i>

1:36:38.797 --> 1:36:41.380
<i>I'm drenched by a rainbow</i>

1:36:42.880 --> 1:36:45.630
<i>It feels like in this world</i>

1:36:46.088 --> 1:36:52.047
<i>I see an eighth color</i>

1:37:40.505 --> 1:37:44.547
Mom, don't worry.
There's always an option.

1:38:34.213 --> 1:38:36.588
<i>Welcome to...</i>

1:38:43.463 --> 1:38:45.422
<i>Our next...</i>

1:38:46.963 --> 1:38:51.380
<i>...impressed me with his unique manner</i>
<i>during auditions.</i>

1:38:56.505 --> 1:38:59.130
<i>Are you a professional cook or...</i>

1:39:00.922 --> 1:39:03.255
<i>Then, what's your...</i>

1:39:03.797 --> 1:39:05.463
<i>My work involves locks.</i>

1:39:06.130 --> 1:39:07.088
<i>Locks?</i>

1:40:13.963 --> 1:40:16.963
