WEBVTT

00:54.340 --> 00:55.300
what are we waiting for?

00:57.250 --> 00:58.120
You got somewhere else.

00:58.120 --> 00:58.720
You need to be.

00:59.175 --> 01:00.585
Is there any of this party servicer?

01:01.665 --> 01:03.075
We use scalpels Scott,

01:07.535 --> 01:08.615
not sledgehammers.

01:22.265 --> 01:22.835
in position.

02:00.750 --> 02:00.840
Okay.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.590
Um, it's okay.

02:04.850 --> 02:05.870
I'm just heading home.

02:06.320 --> 02:06.680
Okay.

02:06.710 --> 02:07.400
Have a good angel.

02:07.730 --> 02:08.030
Thank you.

02:08.030 --> 02:08.539
Have a good night.

02:08.780 --> 02:09.470
Get home safe.

02:09.710 --> 02:10.340
You too.

02:11.870 --> 02:12.200
Thank you.

02:23.875 --> 02:24.305
I'm sorry.

02:24.305 --> 02:24.995
We're closed.

02:26.495 --> 02:27.245
That's okay.

02:28.685 --> 02:30.155
You're the one we're here to see Joseph.

02:33.495 --> 02:33.845
Sorry.

02:33.845 --> 02:34.625
Do I know you?

02:35.345 --> 02:37.355
How do you, how do you know my name?

02:41.595 --> 02:43.275
But we both know that name tag is wrong.

02:43.275 --> 02:43.665
Don't we?

02:46.685 --> 02:47.405
Excuse me.

02:47.975 --> 02:49.055
My name is George.

02:49.745 --> 02:52.115
Nice to meet you, George
and misunderstand.

02:52.985 --> 02:54.155
George is my real name.

02:55.025 --> 02:56.375
It's on my driver's license.

02:56.375 --> 03:00.245
My credit cards, my gym
membership, normal name stuff.

03:00.695 --> 03:02.615
I don't understand what you want.

03:03.665 --> 03:04.415
I want your number.

03:06.255 --> 03:08.655
Seven eight dash nine three four Bravo.

03:08.805 --> 03:09.285
Correct.

03:17.055 --> 03:18.585
I am not going back there.

03:20.325 --> 03:24.555
We'd rather do this the easy
way, but I haven't heard anyone.

03:26.835 --> 03:30.735
We both know that's not
entirely true now, is it?

03:31.425 --> 03:32.325
You don't understand.

03:33.750 --> 03:34.799
They did this to me.

03:35.339 --> 03:41.940
Joseph, look at me, Joseph,
this is your last chance.

03:46.170 --> 03:50.070
This is your last chance, Joe.

03:50.070 --> 03:51.179
I think I forgot my keys.

03:56.355 --> 03:56.625
Right.

05:32.310 --> 05:33.690
Overwatch to keep them on the roof.

06:00.765 --> 06:02.385
Overwatch, we'll take it from here.

07:08.760 --> 07:09.299
all of you.

07:15.780 --> 07:16.559
Let him go.

07:16.919 --> 07:17.609
We can talk.

07:21.155 --> 07:23.555
At walk, your man lives, huh?

07:23.885 --> 07:24.225
Fuck.

07:24.245 --> 07:24.635
Yeah.

07:24.775 --> 07:25.445
Shut up.

07:27.755 --> 07:28.145
Negative.

07:28.145 --> 07:29.015
Hold your fire.

07:32.245 --> 07:33.125
Are you doing Joseph

07:37.835 --> 07:38.615
deserve this?

07:41.745 --> 07:42.605
It's not my problem.

08:30.599 --> 08:32.100
try the cold chisel.

08:32.549 --> 08:34.260
That's going to mess up the threads.

08:35.850 --> 08:37.948
You're going to give yourself
a heart attack, Danny.

08:39.015 --> 08:40.335
You're going to give me an aneurysm.

08:40.335 --> 08:41.924
If you don't mind your own business.

08:44.054 --> 08:45.435
God dammit.

08:46.845 --> 08:48.015
I'm getting this off.

09:18.610 --> 09:19.350
Got it.

09:23.520 --> 09:24.960
I guess I loosened it for you.

09:25.020 --> 09:27.060
I guess so.

09:53.010 --> 09:55.140
When you go clean up, I can finish.

09:55.800 --> 09:56.250
Sure.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.630
Marco what's going on.

10:25.370 --> 10:27.200
Sergeant shepherd, sir.

10:29.390 --> 10:29.720
Excellent.

10:29.720 --> 10:32.960
More today, your first
Bravo class subject.

10:33.420 --> 10:34.170
Thank you, sir.

10:34.510 --> 10:35.430
It was a team effort.

10:38.870 --> 10:40.280
The modesty is not a good look on you.

10:40.280 --> 10:43.700
Sargent permission to speak freely.

10:43.700 --> 10:44.060
Sure.

10:46.760 --> 10:50.270
This subject took Scott
hostage, our Intel from sites.

10:50.270 --> 10:52.190
It shows these subjects to be dangerous.

10:52.250 --> 10:56.120
Programmed killers, hostage,
taking doesn't fit there at Mo

10:56.690 --> 10:57.560
what's your point, Sergeant?

10:58.610 --> 11:00.380
I don't think he wanted
to kill this concert.

11:01.740 --> 11:04.170
Are we sure size data is telling
us everything we need to know.

11:05.550 --> 11:10.530
Subjects will do anything to survive
condition to kill, but also to deceive

11:14.040 --> 11:15.000
cutting basters.

11:46.635 --> 11:52.605
Good team assemble for debrief, sir.

12:13.170 --> 12:14.460
that guy's an asshole.

12:15.450 --> 12:19.440
Mark was harmless besides this is the
only one who can get you, what you need.

12:25.515 --> 12:27.944
Look, I really appreciate
you doing all this.

12:27.974 --> 12:29.135
Yeah, don't mention it.

12:30.485 --> 12:32.435
There's no way I can convince you to stay.

12:32.615 --> 12:32.795
Huh?

12:34.474 --> 12:36.035
I got family stuff.

12:38.435 --> 12:38.885
Have a good night.

12:48.885 --> 12:49.125
Sorry.

12:49.205 --> 12:52.415
I see it in high-risk for some
cushy private sector security work.

12:53.735 --> 12:54.365
We are war

12:58.205 --> 12:59.285
and the war is secret.

13:01.605 --> 13:08.015
The front extends to our homes, but
this unit is the last line of defense

13:08.015 --> 13:09.814
against a truly terrifying force.

13:12.155 --> 13:14.735
There's still dozens of echo and
Delta class subjects on the loose.

13:15.685 --> 13:19.395
As many as 11 Charlie cervix remained on
accounted for and at least four Bravos.

13:20.204 --> 13:23.805
What about the officer alpha
class subjects do not exist.

13:25.485 --> 13:28.275
Siesta shut the project down before
now if it was creative and if they

13:28.275 --> 13:30.795
hadn't, we'd be in serious trouble.

13:34.204 --> 13:39.845
Back to business a week, several
subjects have been found dead.

13:40.795 --> 13:43.715
We believe that these subjects may have
been hunted down by one of their own kind.

13:43.770 --> 13:43.890
Okay.

13:45.329 --> 13:47.640
So you're saying there's an
enhanced serial killer out there

13:48.270 --> 13:52.260
who cares helping us out killing
these things is not our job.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.870
Private Sergeant shepherd.

13:55.770 --> 13:59.420
What is our mission contain and
incarcerated any and all enhanced

13:59.430 --> 14:02.780
subjects for the mutual protection
of the public and themselves.

14:02.930 --> 14:03.380
Sure.

14:04.819 --> 14:05.569
Very good Sergeant.

14:07.490 --> 14:09.230
Now this bogey undermines our mission.

14:10.695 --> 14:14.205
Shall continue the operations for the
time being, but keep your eyes open,

14:15.645 --> 14:19.005
be on the look out for anything out
of the ordinary and do not engage.

14:21.255 --> 14:22.005
Is this clear?

16:15.645 --> 16:19.125
wouldn't kill you to say,
please, please hurry.

16:21.375 --> 16:21.944
Daddy.

16:21.974 --> 16:22.515
Daddy.

16:24.974 --> 16:25.484
daddy.

16:25.484 --> 16:26.805
Daddy.

16:27.645 --> 16:28.275
What's your boss.

16:28.665 --> 16:29.295
Hey Mark.

16:29.464 --> 16:30.185
Perfect timing.

16:30.185 --> 16:31.145
She's already for you.

16:31.435 --> 16:32.045
I was like new.

16:32.645 --> 16:33.635
Thank you, Anna.

16:33.665 --> 16:34.925
You were going to take your lunch break.

16:35.885 --> 16:37.324
I think she should stay now.

16:37.324 --> 16:38.405
The kids gotta eat.

16:38.795 --> 16:45.145
I say she stays just for her right fast.

16:45.145 --> 16:45.635
Thank you.

16:46.354 --> 16:48.515
Wow, Anna just wants to go home.

16:48.574 --> 16:49.415
See your family.

16:50.190 --> 16:50.730
Home.

16:52.350 --> 16:53.700
She don't look Chinese to me.

16:54.000 --> 16:54.330
Listen.

16:54.740 --> 16:56.240
No, you listen.

16:57.110 --> 16:58.790
It's gonna attract the
wrong kind of attention.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.050
This isn't bullshit.

17:00.230 --> 17:01.160
I wasn't talking to you.

17:01.160 --> 17:02.660
Little lady, we had a deal.

17:03.350 --> 17:05.690
You watch a fucking phone with me, the St.

17:05.690 --> 17:06.410
The school yard.

17:06.980 --> 17:12.890
Now you want the passport
new deal, 10 lodge.

17:12.950 --> 17:13.550
Come on.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.380
You know, I don't got that kind of money.

17:15.810 --> 17:16.819
You don't get a passport.

17:19.064 --> 17:19.694
Very simple.

17:26.233 --> 17:26.804
Hold them down.

17:47.460 --> 17:47.879
Show me.

17:51.750 --> 17:52.020
Okay.

17:58.820 --> 18:01.040
I'm at seven 45 Olympic Boulevard.

18:01.250 --> 18:02.060
A man has been shot.

18:02.060 --> 18:03.139
His name is Danny, please.

18:03.260 --> 18:03.590
Sorry.

18:09.270 --> 18:09.780
Sorry.

18:17.670 --> 18:18.300
Yes, sir.

18:18.930 --> 18:19.530
Copy that.

18:21.930 --> 18:23.370
We have a zero point spike.

18:24.240 --> 18:28.020
The coordinates being sent at these
levels, we'll have about two hours, sir.

18:28.110 --> 18:30.510
It's all the team to stood up, but
you and I are tagging them too.

18:39.880 --> 18:40.550
leave the cab.

18:41.335 --> 18:43.475
And it's going after its own kind.

18:44.315 --> 18:45.515
Intel says it's happening.

18:45.515 --> 18:46.085
It's happening.

19:04.030 --> 19:04.690
Make a left

19:22.780 --> 19:23.710
I'll send up the drones.

19:27.010 --> 19:27.520
No need.

19:34.020 --> 19:35.370
She's like 90 pounds.

20:09.425 --> 20:10.115
Excuse me.

20:11.315 --> 20:12.485
Are you following me?

20:13.115 --> 20:13.715
No.

20:14.435 --> 20:18.335
I mean, we need to talk maybe a gym.

20:21.065 --> 20:24.065
Why should I talk to you so
I can help keep you safe?

20:26.340 --> 20:31.530
I don't know what you think, you know,
just take a look at this, watch it.

20:43.489 --> 20:44.120
right.

20:44.750 --> 20:45.139
All right.

20:45.139 --> 20:45.739
I get it.

20:49.879 --> 20:52.699
Talk later, leaving.

20:57.765 --> 21:01.075
sir, we have eyes on target
female, about five, five

21:01.085 --> 21:03.245
brunette slim build photo center.

21:08.135 --> 21:11.525
whereas he services radio chatter
has four men down in an auto shop.

21:12.035 --> 21:15.395
Suspect matches our target no
IDs yet, but to be blunt force

21:15.395 --> 21:19.835
trauma fatalities and one deceased
gunshot victim confirmed we'll tag.

21:21.929 --> 21:24.600
Correction, sir, target is mobile.

21:24.659 --> 21:27.060
We'll pursue have the unit
converge on my signal.

21:49.439 --> 21:49.980
back off.

21:49.980 --> 21:50.820
You're too close.

22:04.500 --> 22:05.160
shit.

22:05.580 --> 22:06.030
Pull over,

22:20.460 --> 22:21.090
get eyes up.

23:18.720 --> 23:19.409
boost the signal.

23:31.169 --> 23:32.780
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

24:06.990 --> 24:07.770
Who the hell are you?

24:08.730 --> 24:12.480
You possess what belongs to me, dude.

24:12.480 --> 24:13.650
You better back off.

25:04.140 --> 25:06.060
seven one nine three two, Charlie.

25:06.870 --> 25:08.459
Come on with your hands above your head.

25:09.120 --> 25:10.739
No one else needs to get her tonight.

25:11.689 --> 25:13.520
I haven't done anything.

25:14.899 --> 25:17.479
Fuck that, man, back at your
shop might disagree with you.

25:49.610 --> 25:53.870
Oh, that that's far enough.

25:54.379 --> 25:59.300
I didn't kill Danny on your knees
with your ass behind your head.

26:07.835 --> 26:08.975
Johnson status?

26:09.515 --> 26:10.475
No readings yet, sir.

27:06.230 --> 27:06.659
holiday.

27:07.754 --> 27:11.504
More like an escape what's in China.

27:12.314 --> 27:13.335
He tried to help him.

27:13.335 --> 27:16.814
I swear, no subjects.

27:16.814 --> 27:18.764
Aren't exactly known to
be the helping comment.

27:19.965 --> 27:20.435
Great.

27:21.905 --> 27:22.534
Let me go.

27:24.665 --> 27:25.715
No, I can't do that.

27:27.665 --> 27:31.024
God, he didn't deserve
this and neither do I.

27:36.149 --> 27:36.659
Stick around.

28:00.210 --> 28:00.930
No, wait

28:17.010 --> 28:17.550
God too.

28:36.765 --> 28:37.005
Yeah,

28:41.445 --> 28:41.685
that.

31:02.790 --> 31:03.030
Okay.

31:34.165 --> 31:34.945
No, we're not.

31:35.064 --> 31:35.965
What'd you think we are?

32:09.030 --> 32:09.840
He's alive.

32:11.520 --> 32:15.690
Case, you're wondering you're him.

32:15.690 --> 32:16.170
Aren't you?

32:20.160 --> 32:20.610
You torch.

32:20.610 --> 32:22.080
So I say, and freed us,

32:25.879 --> 32:28.639
I guess I should say
thank you for saving me.

32:30.730 --> 32:32.590
Altruism is inherently selfish.

32:35.020 --> 32:35.470
Okay.

32:38.110 --> 32:39.850
So do you have a name?

32:45.340 --> 32:45.670
No.

33:17.885 --> 33:18.395
Cromwell.

33:19.235 --> 33:19.835
We're shepherd.

33:19.835 --> 33:20.375
What the hell happened?

33:21.090 --> 33:23.460
Shepherd's Mia, Surrey
froze during containment.

33:23.460 --> 33:27.780
Then he disappeared and the subject,
I believe it's on foot, sir.

33:28.860 --> 33:34.260
Find it for God's sake as for
shepherd, until we find a mirror and

33:34.260 --> 33:39.080
command deliveries delivery, sir.

34:57.780 --> 34:58.590
Who the hell are you?

34:58.850 --> 35:04.070
The subjects, your unit contained where
they held barking up the wrong tree.

35:06.650 --> 35:07.580
It's a nice place.

35:08.600 --> 35:10.100
Your decorator have a number.

35:12.120 --> 35:13.140
I will not ask again.

35:13.319 --> 35:13.799
Look, Paul.

35:13.799 --> 35:14.339
I don't know what.

35:15.000 --> 35:20.250
Wait, if you do not know the
location, then you're no use to me.

35:22.470 --> 35:23.490
You're going to kill him.

35:24.629 --> 35:25.169
Stop it.

35:34.350 --> 35:36.149
You can't just kill people.

35:43.410 --> 35:44.730
And you're no different than they are.

35:46.410 --> 35:46.950
I am.

36:03.330 --> 36:04.140
He hasn't till morning.

37:05.045 --> 37:06.035
usually it's water.

37:16.955 --> 37:17.555
Where are we?

37:19.745 --> 37:20.735
I don't know.

37:29.090 --> 37:29.900
So you're one of them.

37:30.500 --> 37:37.600
One of  I don't work for . No, what?

37:37.600 --> 37:39.350
You're just following orders.

37:40.490 --> 37:42.770
I'm protecting people from their mistakes.

37:43.430 --> 37:45.800
Nobody needs protection from us.

37:46.100 --> 37:48.380
I've seen the files, they made us do it.

37:48.920 --> 37:50.390
Something about following orders.

37:57.735 --> 37:58.305
That's a good one.

38:01.805 --> 38:03.845
You have no idea what they did to us.

38:05.285 --> 38:05.705
There you go.

38:07.145 --> 38:11.165
No, but I know what you've done
and what you're capable of doing.

38:14.345 --> 38:15.725
Try not to take it personally.

38:24.435 --> 38:28.055
Sir, we have a zero point
reading related via satellite.

38:28.475 --> 38:32.165
It looks like it's coming from
Shepherd's wrist sensor, but uh, wow.

38:38.735 --> 38:38.855
Right.

38:38.855 --> 38:40.895
Move out, putting the package.

38:57.750 --> 38:58.710
You can't trust him

39:01.930 --> 39:05.700
because he's a subject because he's worse.

39:07.770 --> 39:08.100
Okay.

39:10.065 --> 39:11.295
And what's that supposed to mean?

39:12.185 --> 39:14.525
Enhance them been turning up
dead all across the country.

39:15.154 --> 39:17.525
One of your own taking
it down from the inside.

39:18.694 --> 39:19.595
No, that's bullshit.

39:20.045 --> 39:20.855
I can protect them.

39:22.865 --> 39:25.444
You tried to kill me now.

39:25.444 --> 39:26.765
You want me to trust you?

39:26.944 --> 39:27.904
You trust him.

39:32.884 --> 39:37.205
What's on this, you
know, Twitter, Instagram.

39:43.575 --> 39:44.655
So, what do I call you?

39:49.035 --> 39:54.285
Ana easier than seven one
nine three two, Charlie.

39:57.845 --> 40:02.345
Yeah, one of the doctors
that I say cult me, Anna.

40:05.310 --> 40:10.950
She uh, said, I looked like her daughter
and she didn't like calling me a number.

40:10.950 --> 40:12.270
So she gave me a name.

40:13.549 --> 40:14.779
That's very kind of her.

40:15.020 --> 40:16.069
Yeah, it is.

40:18.200 --> 40:21.919
She was executed in front of me for
treating a subject like a human.

40:22.399 --> 40:25.520
You filed, says you killed your
doctor during a therapy session.

40:26.299 --> 40:28.460
Crushed your head like a
grape, right after she asked

40:28.460 --> 40:29.799
you about killing your family.

40:31.740 --> 40:32.370
That's a lie.

40:32.580 --> 40:33.630
Why would they lie?

40:35.060 --> 40:37.490
So I say took me when
I was four years old.

40:38.420 --> 40:40.190
I never saw my family again.

40:41.390 --> 40:42.500
They kept me prisoner.

40:42.500 --> 40:48.170
They did things to me and it
was the same for all of us.

40:48.290 --> 40:52.460
If we didn't kill, we were
punished reprogrammed.

40:53.930 --> 40:54.140
Yeah.

40:54.140 --> 40:57.560
There was no escape, no suicide.

40:59.190 --> 41:00.120
We had no choice.

41:15.260 --> 41:16.730
the location of the subjects.

41:17.780 --> 41:18.440
I'm sorry.

41:18.440 --> 41:22.220
You know, I can't really think straight
before I have my morning coffee.

41:22.280 --> 41:25.850
You don't suppose you're
amused and impatient.

41:26.460 --> 41:28.259
Finally something we can agree on.

41:29.009 --> 41:30.720
What do you want with the subject?

41:31.650 --> 41:32.400
I wish the freedom.

41:34.049 --> 41:34.950
Tell me the location.

41:37.799 --> 41:38.279
Sorry.

41:38.279 --> 41:39.960
I'm drawing a blank.

41:41.910 --> 41:45.750
It must be so frightening
to be so fragile.

41:47.970 --> 41:50.730
So close to death at each moment.

41:54.645 --> 41:56.025
Just get it over with,

42:16.425 --> 42:17.715
you know, he's going to kill me.

42:17.715 --> 42:18.045
Right.

42:18.795 --> 42:19.845
And then he's going to kill you.

42:32.720 --> 42:34.910
no, he said he wants to free us.

42:35.240 --> 42:35.840
All of us.

42:35.870 --> 42:37.010
He wants to kill you.

42:37.010 --> 42:37.520
Why?

42:38.540 --> 42:41.180
I don't know, but I know
he killed the others.

42:41.300 --> 42:43.280
You know that for a fact, call it a hunch.

42:43.640 --> 42:47.060
But one thing I know for sure is that
he's going to kill my man right now.

43:23.805 --> 43:26.714
Just let me save them,
just let me save them.

43:26.714 --> 43:28.004
And I'll forget you even exist.

43:28.154 --> 43:30.165
I'll even call off my
team so you can escape.

43:30.335 --> 43:33.335
So I can spend the rest of my
life looking over my shoulder.

43:34.924 --> 43:36.245
How many of us have you captured?

43:38.345 --> 43:39.964
Tell me, or I walk.

43:45.755 --> 43:51.725
About a dozen there's info on
dozens, more still in the wild

44:13.515 --> 44:14.205
What's the reading

44:18.345 --> 44:20.775
only Charlie, sir.

44:46.950 --> 44:47.490
I'm tired.

44:49.575 --> 44:50.535
Telling me right now.

46:47.444 --> 46:47.564
Yeah.

47:36.700 --> 47:37.589
I'm fucking asshole.

48:01.080 --> 48:01.230
Okay.

48:03.225 --> 48:03.495
Hmm.

49:22.035 --> 49:22.845
Control unit.

49:24.555 --> 49:26.205
We all have them to help with programming.

49:30.134 --> 49:31.004
You believe me now

49:34.294 --> 49:35.765
I contained him three days ago.

49:36.634 --> 49:40.625
Does he look contained, supposed to
be the program that incarcerated?

49:40.654 --> 49:40.895
Yeah.

49:40.895 --> 49:42.004
They lied to you.

49:42.484 --> 49:42.935
They did.

49:42.995 --> 49:44.225
What am I supposed to do about it?

49:47.310 --> 49:48.480
You can make a choice.

51:22.970 --> 51:23.930
you get in?

51:24.890 --> 51:26.450
I just want to help get in the car.

51:34.859 --> 51:37.850
To hold it, take it easy, Anna.

51:38.450 --> 51:38.959
You were right.

51:41.299 --> 51:42.080
I need to choose.

51:42.169 --> 51:43.160
Oh, he's one of them

51:49.069 --> 51:49.729
if I'm coming.

51:49.729 --> 51:52.399
So is he fine?

51:52.399 --> 51:52.879
Okay.

51:57.555 --> 51:58.605
You give me the watch.

51:59.174 --> 51:59.865
Come on the watch.

51:59.865 --> 52:01.964
Now watch this.

52:25.035 --> 52:25.665
What is this?

52:54.465 --> 52:55.275
We should be clear.

52:55.965 --> 52:57.915
We don't have the manpower
to secure a perimeter.

52:57.925 --> 52:58.485
This large.

52:58.545 --> 52:59.925
I wasn't referring to them.

53:00.285 --> 53:03.135
I meant David David, more importantly.

53:03.135 --> 53:03.645
Who are you?

53:03.705 --> 53:05.595
Sorry, Eli black.

53:05.805 --> 53:06.135
Okay.

53:06.315 --> 53:06.705
Anna.

53:07.605 --> 53:09.315
Hey, just, yeah.

53:10.560 --> 53:15.720
It's George really bridge.

53:19.339 --> 53:20.150
So where are we heading?

53:20.359 --> 53:21.259
Look, there's a lot.

53:21.259 --> 53:22.370
You don't understand right now.

53:22.370 --> 53:22.850
Okay.

53:23.089 --> 53:24.170
It'll be easier to show you once.

53:24.170 --> 53:28.640
We're safe, safe from David, the charming
fellow who put you two up at the cabin.

53:29.660 --> 53:31.310
If weren't for me, you'd
both be dead right now.

53:31.670 --> 53:33.830
The subject hunting other subjects.

53:33.859 --> 53:34.670
Not exactly.

53:34.700 --> 53:35.040
Hold on.

53:35.040 --> 53:35.450
And why.

53:35.765 --> 53:37.655
Subjects want to kill their own kind.

53:37.655 --> 53:41.165
David's not a subject
that he's the subject.

53:47.245 --> 53:48.055
Relax.

53:48.115 --> 53:48.925
It's a flat

54:23.415 --> 54:24.134
and you fix it.

54:25.004 --> 54:25.785
You have a spare

54:28.875 --> 54:29.055
room.

54:33.810 --> 54:34.980
Grabbing a few chocolate bars.

54:34.980 --> 54:35.850
Anyone need anything?

54:38.010 --> 54:42.450
What I'm hypoglycemic,
you know, just forget it.

54:42.450 --> 54:44.820
Just wait until confusion sets
in and you have trouble speaking.

54:49.050 --> 54:49.980
You trust that guy.

54:51.350 --> 54:55.100
I'm not exactly flush
with options here am I?

54:58.940 --> 54:59.540
I'm a mechanic.

55:00.944 --> 55:01.725
Is your boss.

55:03.884 --> 55:04.154
Yeah.

55:07.185 --> 55:12.435
His name was Danny and
he was trying to help me.

55:12.435 --> 55:14.895
And those guys took advantage of him.

55:15.185 --> 55:16.024
So you killed them.

55:17.075 --> 55:18.035
This what?

55:18.095 --> 55:19.865
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to understand.

55:19.924 --> 55:20.524
I get it.

55:20.524 --> 55:21.334
I'm dangerous.

55:21.334 --> 55:22.325
I'm a murderer.

55:22.355 --> 55:26.314
Look, I don't know what you are, but
I'll admit you're not what I thought.

55:26.615 --> 55:27.455
And how do you know.

55:28.589 --> 55:31.680
Yeah, I can do all of these
things, but what's the point of

55:31.680 --> 55:33.209
everything I touch turns to shit.

55:37.640 --> 55:43.339
A lot of people have died around me
and because of me, I try to tell myself

55:43.339 --> 55:45.200
it's not my fault, but that's a lie,

55:48.509 --> 55:53.959
spent my whole life breaking things
because I'm too weak to fix them.

55:56.759 --> 56:04.080
Look, we don't have to be best friends,
but you have my word, not your enemy.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.440
see back in one piece.

57:59.325 --> 58:00.465
And brought you some visitors.

58:01.215 --> 58:02.145
He always worries.

58:04.415 --> 58:07.295
Is he a one, two, three,
two, three, Charlie.

58:08.315 --> 58:09.935
It was one of my most wanted it's.

58:09.935 --> 58:10.355
Okay.

58:10.895 --> 58:11.375
So, okay.

58:11.375 --> 58:12.005
You won't hurt you?

58:12.875 --> 58:17.375
Uh, Lou Anna, Anna, Lou,
Lou, George, George, Lou.

58:21.785 --> 58:22.115
What?

58:31.350 --> 58:34.320
So how'd you do end up here.

58:34.980 --> 58:36.120
I worked for Sasha.

58:37.190 --> 58:37.910
You're one of them.

58:37.970 --> 58:38.990
No, no.

58:38.990 --> 58:40.820
I was an analyst theoretical stuff.

58:40.880 --> 58:41.690
I didn't know what they were doing.

58:43.190 --> 58:43.820
It's okay.

58:46.670 --> 58:47.090
Go on.

58:47.779 --> 58:52.279
Uh, I was cataloging subatomic anomalies
and subject DNA samples, and I thought

58:52.279 --> 58:53.810
I had discovered something remarkable.

58:54.540 --> 58:57.750
I didn't David destroyed the original
facility and all my research was lost.

58:59.220 --> 59:00.600
I would have died there for one for live.

59:09.319 --> 59:10.200
Doesn't say much.

59:10.230 --> 59:10.620
Does he?

59:11.460 --> 59:18.060
No, not since the program is when I
learned the truth, I felt horrible,

59:18.509 --> 59:20.279
but I continued to work on my own.

59:42.345 --> 59:42.794
okay.

59:48.464 --> 59:49.064
You are okay.

59:49.064 --> 59:49.245
Right.

59:49.245 --> 59:49.544
Soldier.

59:54.720 --> 59:55.110
Good.

59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.920
Cause we have a cluster fuck in our
hands and I need you mission ready.

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:07.400
So the good goddamn happened, actually,
sir, I was hoping you could tell me that

01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:17.600
so SYSA, wasn't just
manipulating subject DNA.

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:18.470
It's simple.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:23.600
Let's just pretend to shoot at
things for a living, everything

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:26.270
in our universe, vibrates with
the unique quantum signature.

01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:29.090
So they figured out how to move
objects into a different space,

01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:31.850
with a different quantum signature
and how to bring them back.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:37.250
Another dimension with no entropy,
just limitless zero point energy.

01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:42.650
And so I say wanted to harvest it bingo,
but yeah, don't get something for nothing.

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:46.730
The energy was entangled
with something alive, David.

01:00:47.205 --> 01:00:50.355
He's the body, they trapped it in, so it
can exist in our universe, but the real

01:00:50.355 --> 01:00:52.365
David is something entirely different.

01:00:53.255 --> 01:00:59.075
So what is he an alien being of pure
energy and not happy about being here.

01:00:59.255 --> 01:00:59.585
Right.

01:00:59.585 --> 01:01:00.425
So he's an alien.

01:01:01.535 --> 01:01:02.135
Sure.

01:01:02.405 --> 01:01:03.395
So what about me?

01:01:04.415 --> 01:01:06.065
DNA was infused with David's.

01:01:06.185 --> 01:01:07.475
So you have the same abilities.

01:01:09.545 --> 01:01:11.855
So what does David want to get home?

01:01:12.485 --> 01:01:14.165
But he has to be whole
again, to make that happen.

01:01:14.405 --> 01:01:14.885
Meaning.

01:01:15.795 --> 01:01:19.424
Meaning he will absorb his energy
from the subjects, all of them.

01:01:19.955 --> 01:01:22.715
Oh, that doesn't sound pleasant.

01:01:25.924 --> 01:01:29.525
We've been tracking missing subjects to
warn them, but our intelligent, complete,

01:01:36.575 --> 01:01:39.965
what, what are you saying exactly?

01:01:40.845 --> 01:01:43.214
I'm saying we were tasked
to contain a Charlie class

01:01:43.214 --> 01:01:44.805
subject, not a fucking alpha.

01:01:45.404 --> 01:01:46.395
There are no alphas.

01:01:47.865 --> 01:01:51.825
I saw Catherine something
that's not in the files.

01:01:52.395 --> 01:01:53.595
Regions were off the charts.

01:01:53.595 --> 01:01:55.575
The tracks barely worked in the squad.

01:01:58.154 --> 01:01:59.234
What about the squad?

01:02:10.350 --> 01:02:11.339
Holy shit.

01:02:11.339 --> 01:02:12.930
You guys built a buffet for them.

01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:16.680
Where are they being held at a
secure location, a few miles away.

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:20.120
We can't let David get what he
needed from this many subjects.

01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:21.379
Can't we just kill him.

01:02:22.759 --> 01:02:26.569
His body is human and it still
bleeds, but he regenerates instantly.

01:02:26.569 --> 01:02:27.500
We need to weaken him.

01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:29.149
What about the tranq?

01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:32.180
It'll be like giving a park,
a set to a charging rhino.

01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:36.080
You're going to need a lot, like, we
might have a chance with this list.

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:36.379
We can.

01:02:37.305 --> 01:02:41.415
Wait, we can, what, you
know, team up, fight him.

01:02:42.845 --> 01:02:44.145
No, no, no, no.

01:02:44.175 --> 01:02:47.055
We need to keep the subjects as
far away from David as possible.

01:02:47.745 --> 01:02:50.295
Let me and my team deal with
this now that we know what we're

01:02:50.295 --> 01:02:51.795
up against, we can handle it.

01:03:00.005 --> 01:03:04.475
What about the squad killed them?

01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:16.665
it's about time.

01:03:16.665 --> 01:03:17.565
We get some goddamn

01:03:34.035 --> 01:03:34.395
Here.

01:03:34.635 --> 01:03:35.295
That's all I've got.

01:03:39.675 --> 01:03:42.975
Oh, and a blood sugar

01:03:48.075 --> 01:03:48.495
weight.

01:03:49.445 --> 01:03:51.545
Where will you go as far away as possible?

01:03:51.965 --> 01:03:54.695
David can't open the doorway
until he's harvested every single

01:03:54.695 --> 01:03:56.615
subject he'll come for you.

01:04:02.444 --> 01:04:03.465
You're really going to do this.

01:04:04.085 --> 01:04:06.694
If they head back until my
captain what's really going on.

01:04:08.375 --> 01:04:09.395
Hey, we could just run.

01:04:09.935 --> 01:04:10.505
You can.

01:04:12.485 --> 01:04:15.275
So that's it.

01:04:15.634 --> 01:04:19.025
That's it just keep moving
and I'll try and stop him.

01:04:19.025 --> 01:04:19.775
What else is there?

01:04:28.115 --> 01:04:28.924
One the others.

01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:33.120
Or just disappear somewhere
and live your life.

01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:35.490
Come on and take it.

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:38.340
You've lost enough already.

01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.480
Okay.

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:41.000
Thank you.

01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:46.010
Yeah, wait,

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:51.140
I need the password.

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:40.560
You have a belongs to me.

01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:43.230
Come on.

01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:43.830
Let's go.

01:06:08.415 --> 01:06:09.944
We can't just leave him there.

01:06:10.035 --> 01:06:11.055
You made a choice.

01:06:11.265 --> 01:06:12.555
Don't let it be for nothing.

01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:30.720
we don't have keys.

01:07:41.535 --> 01:07:42.135
Give me a second.

01:07:43.755 --> 01:07:44.925
We don't have a second.

01:07:56.384 --> 01:07:56.564
Yeah.

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:36.510
Hey, wait, I can help you help me.

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:38.380
The other subjects I can take it.

01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:43.040
There's a list of free subjects,
addresses descriptions.

01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:48.200
You can find them, you
go home, just let her go.

01:08:50.010 --> 01:08:50.540
We have a deal.

01:09:01.995 --> 01:09:02.564
Go ahead.

01:09:06.734 --> 01:09:07.514
What's the location

01:09:10.875 --> 01:09:11.085
to be

01:09:14.144 --> 01:09:15.585
picked up zero point ratings.

01:09:17.054 --> 01:09:18.825
Sorry, let me go.

01:09:18.825 --> 01:09:20.174
I will not let you down.

01:09:21.375 --> 01:09:25.035
I admire your spirit Crump mom,
but he needs to sit this one out.

01:09:32.745 --> 01:09:33.125
sorry.

01:09:33.575 --> 01:09:34.265
Hey, sir.

01:09:34.625 --> 01:09:37.715
If you are doubting my capabilities,
strike team can handle it.

01:09:38.104 --> 01:09:38.734
It, wait, wait, wait.

01:09:39.425 --> 01:09:40.564
You're issuing a kill order.

01:09:41.135 --> 01:09:41.915
It's not my call.

01:09:42.604 --> 01:09:46.564
Squat is out of play the two subjects
that Aveda containment in one night,

01:09:47.944 --> 01:09:52.625
men upstairs decided to simplify things
until we can work this all out, leave

01:09:52.625 --> 01:09:53.825
a skeleton crew and send the rest.

01:09:56.925 --> 01:09:57.585
Sir.

01:10:05.025 --> 01:10:06.075
What about shepherd, sir?

01:10:09.375 --> 01:10:10.815
Shepherd is no longer my concern.

01:10:13.745 --> 01:10:17.285
I don't understand shepherd
aided and abetted the enemy

01:10:18.485 --> 01:10:19.594
until we have reason to believe.

01:10:19.594 --> 01:10:21.094
Otherwise he should be
considered the threat.

01:10:29.555 --> 01:10:31.745
Yeah, a lot of pissed off
people waiting for us.

01:10:32.495 --> 01:10:34.025
It's not too late to change your mind.

01:10:35.465 --> 01:10:36.305
You weapons do not.

01:10:37.385 --> 01:10:38.345
Well, they frightened me.

01:10:39.065 --> 01:10:42.005
I don't want to get caught in the
crossfire concerns are irrelevant.

01:12:02.885 --> 01:12:07.565
We're almost there not
walking away from this one.

01:12:07.565 --> 01:12:07.855
Am I.

01:12:08.925 --> 01:12:09.705
That frightens you.

01:12:10.395 --> 01:12:11.355
I'm not thrilled about it.

01:12:12.375 --> 01:12:14.205
And trippy defines your universe.

01:12:15.045 --> 01:12:21.855
There's no such thing in life and
energy or eternal affection here.

01:12:21.855 --> 01:12:26.615
I'm forced to endure the state
of decay, not an optimist.

01:12:26.615 --> 01:12:29.135
Then why pretend you have the
power to stave off too inevitable?

01:12:30.335 --> 01:12:31.955
There's no safety, no control.

01:12:33.995 --> 01:12:34.715
We'll all die.

01:12:38.625 --> 01:12:39.495
Nothing will save you,

01:12:42.855 --> 01:12:43.844
not even an airbag.

01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:35.760
still at the car.

01:13:38.150 --> 01:13:39.380
Turn off the car heads up.

01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:48.710
Sergeant shepherd, the
hell is going on here.

01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:50.960
You need to speak with captain Williams.

01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:53.540
You've been removed from
active duty Sergeant.

01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:56.060
Um, did detain you until further notice.

01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:58.130
Listen to me when we have
a threat inbound, I need

01:13:58.130 --> 01:13:59.510
to speak with Williams now.

01:13:59.550 --> 01:14:01.490
Sorry I have my orders.

01:14:49.605 --> 01:14:50.445
those won't be needed.

01:15:01.655 --> 01:15:05.764
It's good to see you in one
piece, despite the circumstances,

01:15:09.215 --> 01:15:10.474
what the hell is going on here?

01:15:28.050 --> 01:15:30.570
There was a second subject
in play captain, right?

01:15:30.650 --> 01:15:34.460
No, that doesn't explain
why you broke protocol.

01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:36.559
Don't lecture me about protocol.

01:15:37.099 --> 01:15:37.929
Explain who sense?

01:15:37.929 --> 01:15:39.170
Seven, eight, nine, three, four.

01:15:39.170 --> 01:15:40.010
After us.

01:15:40.490 --> 01:15:41.120
What'd he talk about?

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.920
Well, Joseph was on the war path.

01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:44.240
He attacked us at the cabin.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:45.710
The Fana hadn't saved me.

01:15:45.710 --> 01:15:47.090
You would have been with your squad.

01:15:47.150 --> 01:15:47.240
Okay.

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:51.139
But they're dead now.

01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:52.820
And I had nothing to do with that.

01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:54.500
And you know, it, none of them did.

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:55.820
They're not people they're weapons.

01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:56.480
God damn it.

01:15:57.434 --> 01:15:58.995
Bought and paid for it by our employers.

01:15:59.025 --> 01:16:01.275
And we use them as we see fit.

01:16:01.304 --> 01:16:05.445
They're in danger chillers
and your friend, Anna

01:16:05.504 --> 01:16:06.884
murdered, dozens of innocence.

01:16:10.415 --> 01:16:11.165
She's in your head.

01:16:11.735 --> 01:16:12.634
You don't get it.

01:16:12.634 --> 01:16:13.535
God dammit.

01:16:13.684 --> 01:16:14.855
He's coming for them.

01:16:14.915 --> 01:16:17.195
And anyone standing in
his way, who's coming.

01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:28.680
Just to fucking

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:37.220
get, let them destroy it.

01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:39.810
We can come to us.

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:42.890
You let him here.

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:44.270
We can fight him together.

01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:45.710
Everyone's been deployed.

01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:48.260
What the fuck do we do?

01:16:51.630 --> 01:16:52.290
It's not over yet.

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:53.220
You don't understand.

01:16:53.250 --> 01:16:54.180
Get out of my way.

01:16:54.270 --> 01:16:56.220
You can't serve these people
up to them on a platter.

01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:57.720
This isn't your decision Sergeant.

01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:58.500
No, move your ass.

01:16:58.500 --> 01:16:59.730
This is what he wants.

01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:05.420
I won't ask you again.

01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:20.430
And I to fight these things,
sir, just give me a chance.

01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:24.470
He really believed he could
take this guy down by herself

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:26.540
just to protect the innocence.

01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:29.540
These subjects, these people are innocent.

01:17:33.170 --> 01:17:33.860
They're a good soldier.

01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:38.090
I hired you because I
knew he was the best.

01:17:48.285 --> 01:17:49.875
This time, we're going
to do things my way.

01:19:19.090 --> 01:19:20.080
what the hell is he doing?

01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:26.620
You're only making them.

01:21:17.730 --> 01:21:18.000
Please.

01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:21.269
I say kept me a secret from you.

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:26.490
What can you walk?

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:32.490
Do I want you rid of this?

01:21:33.570 --> 01:21:35.339
Your universe is a decaying carcass.

01:21:36.224 --> 01:21:38.655
I can smell every particle
and it nauseates me.

01:21:40.394 --> 01:21:43.214
I wish to leave it, but not before you

01:21:54.195 --> 01:21:55.125
thought you could lie to you.

01:21:55.334 --> 01:21:56.054
Fuck you.

01:21:56.264 --> 01:21:57.165
Now you could hurt me.

01:21:57.285 --> 01:21:58.575
You're not going to get anything from me.

01:21:58.575 --> 01:21:59.625
You piece of shit.

01:22:00.195 --> 01:22:02.025
If you waste away in your
prison, you should know.

01:22:02.745 --> 01:22:05.175
She will suffer because of your choices.

01:22:06.995 --> 01:22:10.115
You'll try asshole.

01:22:18.785 --> 01:22:20.345
There's more of me too, than I thought

01:22:24.785 --> 01:22:26.165
I look forward to taking it back.

01:23:42.090 --> 01:23:43.020
I don't know, sir.

01:24:29.299 --> 01:24:31.459
you only exist to die.

01:25:51.675 --> 01:25:52.085
Oh,

01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:25.110
what have you done to me?

01:26:25.710 --> 01:26:27.809
I think compared to what
I'm going to do to you now,

01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:34.860
pain you're feeling.

01:26:36.510 --> 01:26:36.870
I know

01:26:54.030 --> 01:26:55.920
because of you pain was all I knew.

01:27:42.570 --> 01:27:44.400
Wait, I must go home.

01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:06.720
The truck's not going to last much longer.

01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:36.360
Uh,

01:29:34.815 --> 01:29:35.265
Yeah.

01:29:54.675 --> 01:29:56.595
Be a while until you're a hundred percent.

01:29:58.785 --> 01:29:59.535
What about you?

01:30:01.035 --> 01:30:02.025
I've had worse.

01:30:14.115 --> 01:30:14.565
You look

01:30:18.705 --> 01:30:19.305
like shit.

01:30:23.825 --> 01:30:25.595
Hey, this is just temporary.

01:30:27.155 --> 01:30:28.145
What's your excuse?

01:30:28.745 --> 01:30:32.675
I don't have one busy
getting my ass kicked.

01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:41.910
So what now?

01:32:01.740 --> 01:32:02.340
Oh, my God.

01:32:04.710 --> 01:32:05.460
How'd you find me?

01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:06.200
Hey.

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:06.559
Yeah.

01:32:06.650 --> 01:32:07.970
I just called for a tow

01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:15.590
still.

01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:16.130
Not better.

01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:18.260
Don't count the years.
