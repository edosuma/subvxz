WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:03.961
Oh. Hey, Ross.

00:04.129 --> 00:07.923
I'm so glad someone's here.
Could you zip me up?

00:10.552 --> 00:11.969
- Sure.
- Thank you.

00:12.137 --> 00:14.847
Can you believe no one
between my apartment and here...

00:15.015 --> 00:17.099
...offered to do that for me?

00:17.267 --> 00:18.809
People.

00:19.686 --> 00:22.688
So why are you so dressed up?

00:22.856 --> 00:24.356
Oh, Mike's picking me up for a date.

00:24.524 --> 00:28.193
Oh, yeah? Now, how's that going?
Is it getting serious?

00:28.361 --> 00:31.822
I don't know. I don't know.
I mean, you know, I like him.

00:31.990 --> 00:35.325
But, you know, am I ready to take
my Grade A loins off the meat market?

00:35.493 --> 00:37.619
I'm not quite sure.

00:39.164 --> 00:43.167
You know, I really admire
your whole dating attitude.

00:43.334 --> 00:46.462
It's so healthy. I'm always like,
"Is this moving too fast?

00:46.629 --> 00:49.214
Is this moving too slow?
Where's this going?"

00:49.424 --> 00:51.633
Yeah, I know.
You are a bit of a drama queen.

00:53.136 --> 00:57.598
You're so much better off, you know?
You just go from guy to guy having fun...

00:57.766 --> 01:00.768
...and not worrying that it
never turns into anything serious.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.271
I wouldn't say "never."

01:04.438 --> 01:06.815
You know, there is that guy.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.610
Okay, well, what about?

01:10.111 --> 01:12.696
Okay, well, there has gotta be someone.

01:12.864 --> 01:17.618
- There isn't! That's what I'm saying.
- Oh, my God, you're right!

01:17.786 --> 01:21.371
I know. And yet, here you are,
all ready for the next date.

01:22.707 --> 01:25.709
I can't believe
I never realized this before.

01:25.877 --> 01:30.130
I'm in my 30s, and I've never been
in a long-term relationship.

01:30.298 --> 01:33.050
Oh, my God, what's wrong with me?

01:34.010 --> 01:36.762
No, no, no.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.680
Um, there's nothing wrong with you.

01:38.848 --> 01:44.269
I mean, you don't strike me as the type
of person that wants to get married anyway.

01:44.437 --> 01:46.772
I want to get married!

01:46.940 --> 01:49.233
No, please...
Please don't cry because of me.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.777
Pheebs,
I don't know what I'm talking about, okay?

01:51.945 --> 01:53.695
I've been divorced three times.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.198
Well, at least you've been married.

01:56.366 --> 01:59.868
Oh, my God.
I want to trade lives with Ross?

02:02.789 --> 02:04.748
Phoebe.

02:05.041 --> 02:07.960
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I'm excited about our date.

02:09.461 --> 02:13.048
Mike, this is Ross Geller.
Ross, this is Mike...

02:16.136 --> 02:18.303
- Sorry, I didn't catch that.
- Mike Hannigan.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.055
- Oh, Ross Geller.
- Hey.

02:20.223 --> 02:24.476
- Uh, so are you sure you're ready to go?
- Uh-huh.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.353
How do I look?

02:28.022 --> 02:31.525
- Do you have a compact in your purse?
- No.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.527
You look great.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.697
- Hey, Joey.
- This girl won't turn around.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.408
I can't tell whether she's hot or not.
What do you think?

03:22.577 --> 03:26.622
Joey, I am not going
to objectify women with you.

03:26.956 --> 03:28.916
But if her face is as nice as her ass...

03:29.083 --> 03:31.835
- Whoo, Mama.
- All right. Thanks.

03:32.003 --> 03:35.380
- Hey, have you talked to Chandler?
- He has to stay in Tulsa this weekend.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.716
- How come?
- I don't know. He has to work.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.677
There's some big rush on the...

03:41.763 --> 03:43.764
Uh...

03:43.932 --> 03:46.308
One of these days,
I'm gonna have to start listening...

03:46.476 --> 03:48.018
...when he talks about his job.

03:49.812 --> 03:52.731
Hey, why don't you fly out there
and surprise him?

03:52.899 --> 03:55.275
Maybe I will go.

03:55.693 --> 04:00.656
Yeah. We'll have a little second
honeymoon at the Tulsa Ramada.

04:00.823 --> 04:02.366
Oh, and you know what
you should bring?

04:02.533 --> 04:05.953
Your black see-through teddy
with the attached garters.

04:09.415 --> 04:12.334
- How do you know I have one of those?
- Didn't until just now.

04:15.463 --> 04:18.298
Ugh. Hot. Not hot.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.341
Hot!

04:21.928 --> 04:23.595
Excuse me?

04:24.430 --> 04:28.725
Uh, I said that I think you're hot.

04:28.893 --> 04:32.145
And, uh, now I'm embarrassed. Heh.

04:32.313 --> 04:34.481
Oh, I thought you said "hi."

04:35.191 --> 04:37.234
That would've been better.

04:37.402 --> 04:40.612
I'll try that. Hi, I'm Joey.

04:40.780 --> 04:41.989
I'm Hayley.

04:42.156 --> 04:46.451
Oh. Look, I don't normally ask out women
that I meet in coffeehouses.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.412
Ha!

04:51.874 --> 04:53.458
Gesundheit.

04:59.173 --> 05:01.383
- But...
- I would love to go out with you.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.386
Really? Great.

05:04.929 --> 05:07.389
Did I...? Did I actually ask you?

05:07.557 --> 05:10.767
Oh, um, that's just where you were going.
I figured I'd help you out.

05:10.935 --> 05:14.062
You don't seem like the kind of guy
who does this a lot?

05:14.230 --> 05:16.273
Ha!

05:18.401 --> 05:20.861
Seriously, Gunther. You should
see someone about that cold.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.738
If it gets much worse, you could die.

05:27.452 --> 05:30.245
- So how'd the date go?
- Well, it was awful.

05:30.413 --> 05:33.040
Every time I thought about
what you said, I started crying.

05:33.207 --> 05:36.001
- So he hasn't called?
- Would you call this girl:

05:36.169 --> 05:39.421
"Thanks for a lovely evening"?

05:40.340 --> 05:42.799
Now I feel terrible. This is all my fault.

05:42.967 --> 05:45.552
You know what
you should feel terrible about?

05:45.720 --> 05:47.846
This could have been my serious guy.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.515
He was sweet and smart and funny.

05:50.683 --> 05:53.101
Do you know how hard it is
to meet a guy like that?

05:53.519 --> 05:55.729
We are a rare breed.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.402
What a great dinner.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.029
Yeah, and hey, thanks again...

06:04.197 --> 06:06.740
...for letting me have that last piece of cake
at the restaurant.

06:06.949 --> 06:11.119
Ha, ha. You're welcome again.
I'm gonna go make some coffee.

06:11.287 --> 06:13.914
- Can I get you anything?
- Uh, do you have any cake?

06:20.046 --> 06:22.214
So this is going pretty good.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.634
Dinner was nice.
We've got a lot in common.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.844
Ooh, Victoria's Secret. Huh.

06:28.012 --> 06:29.805
We even like the same books.

06:32.016 --> 06:34.893
Ooh. There's a scary painting.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.104
Wait a minute.

06:37.271 --> 06:39.773
I think I've been scared
by that painting before.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.861
You know what?
This whole place looks familiar.

06:45.029 --> 06:47.155
I have definitely been in this apartment.

06:47.323 --> 06:50.158
I know I've seen
this weird plant before.

06:50.326 --> 06:53.662
Ow! It did that the last time!

06:53.830 --> 06:56.790
Oh, my God.
I've gone out with this girl before.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.334
Yeah! We had sex on this couch!

06:59.502 --> 07:02.212
And then on that chair, and... No.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.339
No, we didn't do it here...

07:04.507 --> 07:08.301
...which is weird, because it seems
like a perfectly good place.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.178
Ow. That's why.

07:18.104 --> 07:22.482
Hey, Mike. Uh, sorry to just drop by
like this. Can I come in?

07:22.650 --> 07:24.109
Sure.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.403
Who are you?

07:26.904 --> 07:29.406
I'm Ross. Phoebe's friend
from the coffeehouse?

07:29.574 --> 07:30.574
Right, yeah.

07:30.741 --> 07:32.784
I really, really need to talk
to you about something.

07:32.952 --> 07:35.245
Okay. Unless...

07:35.413 --> 07:38.582
You're not gonna try
and get me to join a cult, are you?

07:39.834 --> 07:41.209
- No.
- Oh...

07:41.377 --> 07:44.588
No, it's just, you know,
you have that look.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.257
Damn Supercuts.

07:49.886 --> 07:53.305
- Well, what's up? Is Phoebe okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. No.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.725
Oh, Phoebe is great. But, um...

07:56.893 --> 07:58.894
I'm an idiot, okay?

07:59.061 --> 08:03.607
Look, right before you guys went out,
I accidentally got her all upset.

08:03.774 --> 08:05.984
Oh. That's why she was weird.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.945
Yes, yeah. I said something stupid...

08:09.113 --> 08:11.573
...about her never having
had a serious relationship.

08:11.741 --> 08:15.785
But you should know, she is
so much fun. A wonderful person.

08:15.953 --> 08:20.123
- Please, don't blow her off.
- I'm not gonna blow her off.

08:20.291 --> 08:23.251
I actually just got off the phone with her.
We're going out tomorrow night.

08:23.419 --> 08:28.131
I mean, I hope that's okay with you,
stranger from the coffeehouse.

08:29.133 --> 08:31.426
Well, then, I didn't need to bother you.

08:31.594 --> 08:36.264
Um, you or the four other
Mike Hannigans I bothered.

08:38.934 --> 08:42.562
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Is that true what you said?

08:42.730 --> 08:44.940
Phoebe's never had
a serious relationship?

08:46.651 --> 08:48.443
Of course she has.

08:48.653 --> 08:51.154
If she's never had
a serious relationship...

08:51.322 --> 08:53.615
...do you think I'd go
around broadcasting it...

08:53.783 --> 08:58.203
...like some kind of unstoppable moron?

08:59.372 --> 09:03.166
- But you did say it.
- Yes. Yes, I did.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.337
And I will also say...

09:07.505 --> 09:09.839
...what I'm about to say...

09:10.758 --> 09:12.842
...vis-Ã -vis...

09:13.010 --> 09:14.761
...the following.

09:16.722 --> 09:21.560
Phoebe has never had
a serious relationship...

09:22.603 --> 09:24.312
...since...

09:24.480 --> 09:28.984
...her super-serious relationship...

09:29.151 --> 09:30.402
...with...

09:30.570 --> 09:32.153
...Vikram.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.408
- Vikram?
- What? That's a real name.

09:40.496 --> 09:43.456
Oklahoma, where the wind comes

09:43.624 --> 09:45.417
sweeping down the plain

09:45.585 --> 09:47.544
Stop it.

09:47.712 --> 09:50.255
Why couldn't they have
sent me to Texas?

09:51.299 --> 09:52.632
Seven o'clock.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.552
Maybe I'll hit the gym.

10:01.475 --> 10:04.728
Ah, who am I kidding?
Pay-per-view porn.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.535
- Do not disturb! Do not disturb!
- Surprise!

10:23.789 --> 10:26.458
- Monica?
- Is everything all right?

10:26.626 --> 10:28.793
Yeah, everything's great. I was just, uh...

10:28.961 --> 10:31.630
...watching some
regular television there.

10:32.214 --> 10:35.050
What a pleasant surprise.

10:42.516 --> 10:45.852
- I'm gonna go freshen up, okay?
- Okay, honey.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.901
Ooh. That was close.

10:56.405 --> 10:57.864
- Hello.
- Rach, it's me.

10:58.032 --> 11:02.327
Okay, I just got to Chandler's room,
and I caught him...

11:02.495 --> 11:04.579
...molesting himself.

11:05.206 --> 11:08.458
Ugh. That couldn't have been pretty.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.752
But you know, guys do that.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.420
Uh, well, the weird part is...

11:12.588 --> 11:16.049
...he was getting off
to a shark-attack show.

11:16.509 --> 11:20.970
- No!
- Yes! Chandler watches shark porn!

11:27.395 --> 11:29.479
- While watching sharks?
- Yeah.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.981
Are you sure that's what he was doing?

11:32.149 --> 11:35.068
Do you know how many times
I've seen him jump up like that?

11:35.236 --> 11:37.320
Believe me, I know what he was doing.

11:38.322 --> 11:40.782
Man. Sharks.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.243
I always knew there was something weird
about that dude.

11:45.037 --> 11:46.830
You promised to love him
no matter what.

11:46.997 --> 11:51.167
"What" means, like, if he gets a disease
or kills someone.

11:51.669 --> 11:55.130
- Not if he gets his jollies to Jaws.
- Oh.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.425
You know what, honey?
Guys are just different.

11:58.592 --> 12:01.177
They like things
that we can't understand.

12:01.345 --> 12:03.680
You know, I once dated this guy
who wanted to pretend...

12:03.848 --> 12:07.016
...that he was an archeologist,
and that I was this...

12:07.184 --> 12:11.938
...naughty cavewoman
who he unfroze from a block of ice.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.859
Ew, are you talking about my brother?

12:16.026 --> 12:18.236
Yeah, I didn't disguise that very well, did I?

12:21.115 --> 12:22.157
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:22.324 --> 12:24.534
Listen to this.
I went out with this girl last night.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.661
Halfway through our date I realized...

12:26.829 --> 12:28.246
...I already slept with her.

12:30.207 --> 12:32.167
You've slept with all the women
in New York...

12:32.334 --> 12:34.669
...and now you're going around again?

12:34.879 --> 12:36.337
That's not even the weird part.

12:36.505 --> 12:38.715
I don't think she remembered
sleeping with me!

12:38.883 --> 12:40.675
But you don't remember
sleeping with her.

12:40.843 --> 12:44.012
Yeah, but she should remember sleeping
with me. I am very memorable!

12:45.723 --> 12:47.640
- You guys know.
- How do we know?

12:47.808 --> 12:50.185
- We've never slept with you.
- And whose fault is that?

12:52.354 --> 12:54.689
What's the big deal?
You forgot, she forgot.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.776
- Maybe you were having an off night.
- Hey!

13:00.654 --> 13:03.239
I never have an off night. Okay?

13:03.407 --> 13:06.785
Although, sometimes if I'm a little bloated,
I don't feel that sexy.

13:06.952 --> 13:09.037
But even then, I'm better than most.

13:10.539 --> 13:13.666
Honey, why don't you just let it go
and ask her out again?

13:13.834 --> 13:16.669
Yeah, you're both so slutty,
you don't remember who you slept with.

13:16.837 --> 13:18.546
You're made for each other.

13:20.382 --> 13:22.342
Interesting. Yeah.

13:23.636 --> 13:27.013
All right, well, I'll go out with her again
and I'll try to get past it.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.557
No salt! Bloaty!

13:30.017 --> 13:31.476
- Joey?
- What?

13:31.644 --> 13:33.728
You don't think sharks are sexy, do you?

13:33.896 --> 13:35.355
No.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.650
Wait a minute.
Wait, what was the Little Mermaid?

13:43.489 --> 13:44.572
It's open!

13:45.115 --> 13:48.117
- Hey.
- Hey. Mike called! We're going out again!

13:48.285 --> 13:50.203
- Yay! Yay!
- Yay.

13:52.706 --> 13:55.083
- Quick thing. I went to talk to Mike.
- Yeah.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.459
What?

13:56.836 --> 13:59.212
What did you...? What did you do, Ross?

13:59.380 --> 14:01.798
Oh, boy. You got mad at that part.

14:03.092 --> 14:06.010
I went over there, you know,
to tell him how...

14:06.178 --> 14:09.806
How great you are. Ahem, but...

14:09.974 --> 14:12.642
Well, you know me. Blah, blah, blah.

14:14.979 --> 14:18.731
- And I ended up telling him, um, that...
- What?

14:18.899 --> 14:23.194
Um, you had a six-year-long
relationship...

14:23.362 --> 14:25.280
...with a guy named Vikram.

14:26.907 --> 14:28.950
What? Why?

14:29.118 --> 14:31.744
Well, he seemed...

14:31.912 --> 14:36.791
...to bum hard when I told him you'd
never been in a serious relationship.

14:41.171 --> 14:44.007
If you hadn't just had a baby
with my best friend...

14:44.174 --> 14:47.552
...I swear to Lucifer...

14:47.720 --> 14:51.806
...a rabid dog would be feasting
on your danglers right now.

14:53.392 --> 14:56.311
Phoebe, I think you'll feel differently
when you know...

14:56.478 --> 14:58.855
...a little bit about Vikram.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.399
Okay, he's, um...

15:01.567 --> 15:04.861
He's a kite designer.

15:06.697 --> 15:10.158
And he used to date Oprah.

15:11.660 --> 15:15.496
I'm not going along
with some lie you made up, Ross.

15:15.664 --> 15:18.082
- I'm just gonna be honest with him.
- Good.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.584
Yeah, just be honest with him.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.253
- Yeah, I have nothing to be ashamed of.
- No.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.756
Okay, so, all right,
I haven't been in a relationship...

15:24.924 --> 15:26.883
...that lasted longer than a month.

15:27.051 --> 15:29.510
Okay? I haven't had a real boyfriend.

15:29.678 --> 15:34.307
You know, if he can't handle it,
then he can leave. Which he will.

15:34.475 --> 15:38.102
And, you know, that's okay.
So I'll just be alone forever.

15:38.270 --> 15:41.022
You know, all right.
It'll be fine. It'll be fine.

15:41.190 --> 15:44.817
I'll go on walking tours
with widows and lesbians.

15:47.237 --> 15:49.197
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

15:52.034 --> 15:56.204
I'm trying to remember the last time
I opened a door and you weren't there.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.960
Phoebe, are you okay?

16:02.795 --> 16:07.006
Uh-huh. Yeah. There's just, um...

16:07.883 --> 16:09.634
There's something you should know.

16:12.554 --> 16:14.347
Vikram just called.

16:16.892 --> 16:19.811
So it was really a shock
after 25 years of marriage...

16:19.979 --> 16:22.897
...my parents getting divorced.
I took it the hardest...

16:23.065 --> 16:25.525
...because I was the youngest.
- Mm-hm. Sure. Yeah.

16:25.693 --> 16:28.194
How can you not remember me?

16:28.988 --> 16:30.071
What?

16:30.239 --> 16:32.198
How could you not remember
that we slept together?

16:32.366 --> 16:35.326
- What? When?
- I don't know.

16:35.911 --> 16:39.205
I really, really think
I would remember sleeping with you.

16:39.373 --> 16:42.792
Come on, come on.
Search your brain, all right? It was...

16:42.960 --> 16:46.587
...a certain amount of time ago.
Okay, I was here. You were here.

16:46.755 --> 16:49.215
We had sex here, here, here...

16:49.383 --> 16:51.300
Not there.

16:51.468 --> 16:54.595
- Anything?
- No, it's not ringing any bells.

16:54.763 --> 16:56.931
My God, woman.

16:57.099 --> 16:59.976
How many people have you been with
not to remember this?

17:00.144 --> 17:03.271
Hey, Hayley.
We really gotta fix that doorknob.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.148
Joey?

17:06.775 --> 17:08.401
Oh.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.780
I slept with you!

17:14.532 --> 17:18.368
And you obviously remember me.
Hey, I still got it!

17:18.537 --> 17:19.787
So we're good.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.290
I'll let myself out.

17:25.335 --> 17:28.337
And I said, "Okay, Vikram...

17:28.505 --> 17:30.673
...you can't just call
every time you get lonely.

17:30.841 --> 17:31.924
- Yeah.
- You know?

17:32.092 --> 17:35.553
You gave up that right
when you slept with Rachel."

17:36.722 --> 17:39.098
Rachel? I thought she just
had a baby with Ross.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.559
Yeah, well...

17:41.727 --> 17:43.227
Yeah.

17:43.562 --> 17:46.647
You know, but Emma's birth certificate
might say "Geller"...

17:46.815 --> 17:49.776
...but her eyes say "Mukherjee."

17:51.028 --> 17:54.947
That is so wrong.
And on top of that, he's a glue sniffer?

17:55.115 --> 17:58.034
I know. But he calls,
and my heart goes to him.

17:58.202 --> 18:03.414
You know, that bastard is one
smooth-talking freelance kite designer.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.960
I think there's somebody
better out there for you.

18:08.128 --> 18:11.589
I mean, you know, I'm...
I'm not saying me, but...

18:12.800 --> 18:15.176
Maybe me.

18:16.553 --> 18:17.595
Oh.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.723
And you don't have to worry about
glue-sniffing with me.

18:20.891 --> 18:24.102
Although, I do smell
the occasional Magic Marker.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.689
Yeah. Uh, anyway, I just...

18:29.066 --> 18:31.442
I think I can make you happy.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.365
- Okay, I can't do this.
- What's wrong?

18:37.533 --> 18:41.577
Well, there is no Vikram.
Ross made him up.

18:41.745 --> 18:43.204
Because I...

18:43.372 --> 18:46.290
I really never have been
in a long-term relationship.

18:46.458 --> 18:51.003
I've never lived with a guy.
I've never even celebrated an anniversary.

18:51.338 --> 18:52.713
So...

18:54.258 --> 18:57.176
You know, if that's too weird for you...

18:57.344 --> 18:59.512
...and you want to leave,
I totally understand.

18:59.680 --> 19:03.099
In fact, I'll close my eyes
to make it less awkward.

19:10.524 --> 19:12.567
You kissed me.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.027
Uh-huh.

19:15.195 --> 19:18.406
- So you don't think I'm a total freak?
- No.

19:18.574 --> 19:20.283
Well...

19:21.160 --> 19:22.618
Look, can I?

19:22.786 --> 19:25.830
Can I think you're a little weird
and also cool...

19:25.998 --> 19:28.666
...for telling me the truth
and also want to kiss you?

19:29.251 --> 19:30.835
I guess so.

19:31.211 --> 19:33.671
Can I think it's cool
that you kissed me...

19:33.839 --> 19:36.424
...and also want to kiss you again?

19:38.135 --> 19:42.305
And, um, be a little concerned
about the Magic Markers?

19:42.472 --> 19:43.764
Definitely.

19:50.939 --> 19:53.357
This is Vikram.

20:01.575 --> 20:04.076
Hi, honey, I'm home.

20:04.745 --> 20:05.995
Hi.

20:06.163 --> 20:09.749
- How was your flight?
- Oh, it was great.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.876
Why don't you sit down.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.502
Get yourself comfortable.

20:13.670 --> 20:16.339
Because I have a little...

20:16.506 --> 20:18.758
...surprise for you.

20:19.843 --> 20:22.470
Well, well, well. It must be 5 in Tulsa...

20:22.638 --> 20:26.390
...because it's sex o'clock in N.Y. C!

20:28.227 --> 20:32.396
Okay. This is how much I love you.

20:33.607 --> 20:35.733
The great white...

20:41.406 --> 20:42.990
Honey?

20:43.200 --> 20:46.619
Why am I watching
a bunch of sharks swimming around?

20:47.788 --> 20:49.789
Oh, is this...? Is this not the good part?

20:50.249 --> 20:54.669
Do you want me to fast-forward
to something toothier?

20:55.087 --> 20:59.090
No, I'm just not sure that you
got the right movie, that's all.

20:59.299 --> 21:02.802
Oh. This is the only one
they had at our video store.

21:02.970 --> 21:06.097
Though they did have something
called Crocodile Killers.

21:06.265 --> 21:09.058
Or does it always have to be sharks?

21:11.186 --> 21:13.229
Does what always have to be sharks?

21:13.397 --> 21:15.606
Honey, look, we can do something else.

21:15.774 --> 21:19.902
Do you want me to
get into the tub and thrash?

21:21.697 --> 21:25.074
- What's going on?
- Sweetie, it's okay. It's okay.

21:25.242 --> 21:27.076
I still love you.

21:27.244 --> 21:31.247
- Let me be a part of this.
- Let me be a part of this!

21:32.624 --> 21:34.834
I saw what you were doing in Tulsa.

21:35.002 --> 21:37.753
Angry sharks turn you on!

21:39.131 --> 21:40.715
No, they don't.

21:41.300 --> 21:45.553
Then why were you watching them
and giving yourself a treat?

21:46.096 --> 21:49.390
Oh, my God. When you came in,
I switched the channel.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.226
I was just watching regular porn.

21:53.353 --> 21:54.478
Really?

21:54.646 --> 21:58.983
Yes. Just some good, old-fashioned,
American, girl-on-girl action.

22:00.944 --> 22:04.405
- Can I tell you how happy that makes me?
- Oh.

22:05.657 --> 22:08.617
You are an amazing wife.

22:08.785 --> 22:12.163
Really, you are amazing.
You were actually gonna do this for me?

22:12.331 --> 22:15.791
I mean, where do you find the strength
and the understanding for that?

22:17.878 --> 22:19.670
I'm very, very drunk right now.

22:28.180 --> 22:31.724
See, ordinarily, I would talk to her,
but my confidence is shaken.

22:31.892 --> 22:34.477
Did I sleep with her?
Did I not sleep with her?

22:34.811 --> 22:36.937
You know, maybe this is a wake-up call.

22:37.105 --> 22:40.232
You know,
about your whole dating attitude.

22:40.400 --> 22:43.986
You're in your 30s and you have
never been in a long-term relationship.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.656
Here you go from woman to woman...

22:47.824 --> 22:50.201
...meaningless experience
to meaningless experience.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.746
Never even worrying that it doesn't
turn into something more serious.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.915
You're right. I love my life!

23:01.421 --> 23:03.881
I actually did sleep with her. Heh.
