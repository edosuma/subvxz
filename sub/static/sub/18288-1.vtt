WEBVTT

00:08.037 --> 00:09.572
Alright, I got it.

00:11.891 --> 00:13.300
Take this inside.

00:14.861 --> 00:16.527
Get it back off the truck.

00:22.728 --> 00:23.922
Sergeant,

00:23.957 --> 00:25.866
the investigation team
is on their way.

00:28.114 --> 00:29.839
Okay, tell me what we know.

00:29.874 --> 00:32.287
It seemed to be
having a party of some kind,

00:32.322 --> 00:34.990
there are seven ladies inside
and a little girl.

00:35.025 --> 00:36.963
The little girl was asleep when

00:36.998 --> 00:38.470
they found the woman
in the swimming pool.

00:38.574 --> 00:40.802
Any evidence
of drugs or alcohol?

00:41.297 --> 00:43.656
Oh, just a few drinks and
a bottle of wine. That's about it.

00:43.692 --> 00:44.767
What about the victim?

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

01:03.199 --> 01:04.602
Evening.

01:05.245 --> 01:07.752
My name is
Sergeant Marybeth Duffy.

01:08.575 --> 01:10.322
Who's the homeowner,
please?

01:11.425 --> 01:13.052
Hi, I am Bette Porter.

01:14.048 --> 01:14.930
- Bette Porter?
- Yes,

01:14.978 --> 01:16.891
and this is my partner,
Tina Kennard.

01:18.025 --> 01:19.000
Hi.

01:21.068 --> 01:23.183
It's a very beautiful family.

01:23.217 --> 01:24.721
Thank you.

01:26.696 --> 01:29.271
I don't plan
on keeping you long,

01:29.315 --> 01:31.922
but I'm sure you understand
I've gotta ask a few questions.

03:08.468 --> 03:09.882
{\a6}Jennyfer Schecter.

03:09.928 --> 03:11.513
{\a6}We love you Jenny!

03:14.056 --> 03:15.680
{\a6}We love you too, Jenny!

03:15.718 --> 03:17.332
{\a6}Thank you.

03:20.005 --> 03:23.430
{\a6}I wanna thank
my incredible friends

03:24.187 --> 03:27.392
{\a6}who I,
I really love you, guys.

03:28.406 --> 03:30.152
{\a6}You guys have,

03:31.175 --> 03:33.160
{\a6}have shown me loyalty,

03:34.596 --> 03:36.453
{\a6}and so much compassion.

03:37.636 --> 03:39.213
{\a6}And

03:39.855 --> 03:41.553
{\a6}friendship and I,

03:41.586 --> 03:43.921
{\a6}I think that's what
"Lez Girls" is all about.

03:43.968 --> 03:46.261
{\a6}It means the world to me

03:47.256 --> 03:50.082
{\a6}more than any other movie or lover.

03:53.595 --> 03:55.740
{\a6}Is, is Niki here?

03:55.775 --> 03:59.103
{\a6}I saw her outside,
by the little pagoda.

03:59.136 --> 04:01.550
{\a6}I wanna tell her something,
'cause I, I was...

04:01.595 --> 04:05.572
{\a6}I realized something really important
this afternoon. That

04:06.755 --> 04:09.992
{\a6}I am madly in love with someone,

04:11.017 --> 04:14.521
{\a6}and it's changed the way I feel
about all of this.

04:15.456 --> 04:18.702
{\a6}Thank you for
putting up with me.

04:22.325 --> 04:23.520
Thank you, Jenny.

04:24.866 --> 04:26.191
MUSIC

04:29.028 --> 04:31.903
Are you kidding me?
You agreed to change the ending?!

04:31.936 --> 04:34.203
- God, it's so...
- Tina, it makes total sense

04:34.247 --> 04:36.312
that Jesse would go back to Jim
in the end.

04:36.346 --> 04:38.611
Jesse never really felt gay
at the beginning.

04:38.657 --> 04:40.253
What the fuck
would you know about it?!

04:40.348 --> 04:41.830
- What?
- That is so fucked up!

04:41.866 --> 04:44.002
- Tina, come on.
- You're so fucking Hollywood!

04:44.048 --> 04:47.071
So Williams spends a little more money.
What's the big deal?

04:47.107 --> 04:49.113
This is bullshit!
We worked really hard

04:49.157 --> 04:50.933
on a movie that we believed in

04:51.018 --> 04:52.502
and the marketing people
just come along

04:52.505 --> 04:53.942
and change the whole ending?

04:53.977 --> 04:55.800
The guy gets the girl
in the end?!

04:56.367 --> 04:59.080
This is the movie that was supposed
to change all that.

04:59.117 --> 05:00.590
Look, Tina.

05:00.635 --> 05:04.041
If the movie's too gay,
it's going to alienate the audience.

05:04.076 --> 05:05.142
Too gay!

05:05.185 --> 05:07.411
It's a movie about lesbians.

05:07.446 --> 05:11.031
And the movie is full of lesbians.
It's choke full of them.

05:11.087 --> 05:14.291
Bev is a lesbian, Nina's a lesbian,
Shaun, Dona, what's your face,

05:14.345 --> 05:16.251
- the, uh, bisexual?
- Alyse.

05:16.295 --> 05:17.483
Alyse! She's not interested.

05:17.528 --> 05:19.520
And when we're talking
about one character here,

05:19.525 --> 05:21.441
- it's not that big deal.
- I just wanna know one thing.

05:21.478 --> 05:23.473
How do you do it?
How do you live with yourself?

05:23.556 --> 05:25.100
What the hell is going on?

05:25.146 --> 05:27.401
The studio wants to change
the ending of the movie.

05:27.446 --> 05:29.172
They want Jesse to go back to Jim.

05:29.207 --> 05:30.393
What?!

05:30.436 --> 05:32.230
They think it's too gay.

05:32.267 --> 05:33.460
Too gay?

05:33.496 --> 05:35.343
Wait, you're not gonna let them
go away with that, are you?

05:35.376 --> 05:37.813
I'm telling you it's the man
that does this crazy shit.

05:37.845 --> 05:40.090
Jenny, would you talk to me?
I'm your friend, please.

05:40.127 --> 05:42.063
- No, Shane.
- You guys, come on.

05:42.105 --> 05:44.223
- Can we all just be friends, please?
- Jenny, I am your friend. I swear.

05:44.268 --> 05:45.131
- I swear.
- You know what?

05:45.137 --> 05:46.942
It's the ultimate betrayal.

05:48.935 --> 05:50.791
You've broken my heart.

05:54.157 --> 05:56.110
MUSIC

06:13.037 --> 06:14.653
It's... Damnit, Jenny!

06:17.487 --> 06:19.440
That's right.
No, please, don't.

06:19.477 --> 06:20.912
No, I have
to call you back, okay?

06:20.936 --> 06:22.522
I can't talk right now.

06:34.066 --> 06:36.550
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

07:00.005 --> 07:01.443
Jenny, please.

07:02.008 --> 07:03.640
Jenny, please, just give me

07:03.688 --> 07:05.411
half the chances to explain

07:05.477 --> 07:06.831
why the hell I would do
something like that.

07:06.878 --> 07:08.300
- Fuck off!
- No, no, no, no!

07:08.345 --> 07:09.903
Wait, you guys!

07:11.068 --> 07:12.071
Fuck!

07:26.005 --> 07:28.042
- You wanna talk about it?
- Talk about what?

07:28.085 --> 07:30.532
Well, you're kicking my shoes.
You kind of shiftfaced.

07:30.567 --> 07:31.941
I'm not shiftfaced.

07:31.956 --> 07:33.082
A little bit.

07:34.168 --> 07:37.210
It's Helena. Hold on one second.
Hey, Helena, I can't talk.

07:38.508 --> 07:41.391
Yeah, no,
it's Adele and Tina's

07:41.438 --> 07:43.482
creepy boss. They met
at the studio secretly.

07:43.517 --> 07:44.541
Just one second.

07:44.576 --> 07:47.081
And they were just gonna
make end into a grobbery left story

07:47.117 --> 07:49.033
that makes the lesbian random.

07:52.337 --> 07:55.192
I know. That did happen!
That's what...

07:55.227 --> 07:57.501
Tash! Jesus! I got...

07:58.098 --> 08:01.961
Yeah, Jenny made the speech,
went outside, saw Shane...

08:02.007 --> 08:03.372
You know, I can't talk.

08:03.418 --> 08:04.830
It's a bad time.

08:04.867 --> 08:07.643
Okay, I'll tell you later.
Yeah.

08:16.516 --> 08:17.611
What are you doing?

08:17.688 --> 08:19.943
Saving you the trouble
of breaking up with me.

08:20.646 --> 08:23.340
What? Oh my...
You're so wrong about...

08:25.508 --> 08:27.320
I changed my mind, okay?

08:28.695 --> 08:30.390
You changed your mind?

08:31.018 --> 08:32.131
Yeah.

08:32.176 --> 08:34.789
So you did wanna break up
with me, but now you don't.

08:34.836 --> 08:37.620
Okay, listen, I don't want you to
just start flying off the handle

08:37.655 --> 08:38.789
because it's, it's like...

08:38.826 --> 08:40.789
- When did this all happened?
- You know what?

08:40.836 --> 08:42.163
I'm not gonna let you just

08:42.195 --> 08:44.752
fucking corner me right now
and accuse me and blame me

08:44.798 --> 08:46.413
when you know
we'd been unhappy!

08:47.066 --> 08:48.123
It didn't...

08:48.166 --> 08:49.933
Fuck, it's Jenny.

08:53.228 --> 08:55.673
I just think, um...
to, I mean...

08:57.516 --> 09:00.371
Okay, I do not wanna
break up with you.

09:00.416 --> 09:01.811
I wanna work this out.

09:01.835 --> 09:03.971
I think we owe it to each other.
We owe it to ourselves.

09:04.006 --> 09:05.943
You don't owe me,
you don't owe me anything.

09:05.987 --> 09:07.381
I owe it to myself.

09:07.428 --> 09:08.913
I... I don't...

09:10.256 --> 09:12.092
I don't wanna break up with you.

09:12.758 --> 09:15.190
So what made you
change your mind?

09:18.077 --> 09:20.992
Honestly, I think
it was Shane tonight.

09:21.026 --> 09:23.171
Going down on
her best friend's girlfriend.

09:23.216 --> 09:24.222
Yeah, like

09:24.258 --> 09:26.990
on the railing outside the Yamashiro
for the whole world to see.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.422
It just kinda made me

09:28.507 --> 09:30.566
think twice about
taking her advice.

09:30.602 --> 09:32.767
So Shane gave you advice?

09:32.769 --> 09:34.630
Oh, come on,
we talk about everything.

09:34.647 --> 09:35.792
You know that. Don't I...

09:35.836 --> 09:37.751
And you actually thought about taking it.

09:40.595 --> 09:41.803
MUSIC

09:41.846 --> 09:44.591
- Jenny, undo the chain.
- No, fuck off.

09:44.627 --> 09:46.453
Jenny, I don't wanna wake up
the whole goddam neighbourhood.

09:46.455 --> 09:48.532
- Undo the fucking chain.
- I don't care.

09:48.578 --> 09:50.610
Listen, I know what I did
is completely fucked up,

09:50.647 --> 09:52.321
but you do mean the world to me.
So please,

09:52.356 --> 09:54.043
let me just talk to you and
explain to you what happened.

09:54.085 --> 09:55.801
You're a sad pathetic piece

09:55.847 --> 09:56.742
of shit!

09:58.887 --> 10:00.811
Jenny, open the door!

10:07.087 --> 10:09.463
She's sleeping.
She's so pretty congested.

10:09.505 --> 10:12.670
- You said you gave her some advil?
- Yeah, about an hour and a half ago.

10:12.707 --> 10:15.371
You know, in the future,
you should just call us right away.

10:15.415 --> 10:17.022
In this way,
we'll come straight home.

10:17.058 --> 10:18.670
Okay, yeah, of course.

10:18.676 --> 10:20.381
That would be great, thank you.

10:20.396 --> 10:21.740
Have a good night.

10:23.795 --> 10:25.611
God, she's young.

10:25.645 --> 10:27.401
I'm just so fucking furious,
you know?

10:27.406 --> 10:30.042
I know that Adele and Aaron
worked him over.

10:30.046 --> 10:32.572
William has some integrity. He does.
I mean, believe it or not.

10:32.577 --> 10:34.670
If I had a chance
to talk to him.

10:34.678 --> 10:36.040
You should call him.

10:36.045 --> 10:37.680
It's 1:30 in the morning.

10:37.696 --> 10:39.110
You should call him.

10:39.457 --> 10:41.812
It's not like he hasn't called you
about half a dozen times

10:41.846 --> 10:43.173
in the middle of the night.

10:43.215 --> 10:45.300
You realize he pays my paycheck?

10:45.337 --> 10:47.823
But it doesn't give him
rights on you.

10:47.867 --> 10:49.823
I mean, from
everything you've told me,

10:49.867 --> 10:52.343
William responds
to strength of conviction.

10:52.378 --> 10:54.220
I think
that you need to tell him

10:55.085 --> 10:56.861
how deeply you feel about this

10:56.896 --> 10:59.572
without Adele standing there
batting her eyelashes at him.

10:59.617 --> 11:01.100
He'll respect it.

11:04.087 --> 11:05.963
Jenny, you've got
to let me in.

11:06.605 --> 11:08.880
I'm not going away.
Let me in.

11:13.848 --> 11:16.631
Jenny, I'm not going.
Please, let me in.

11:21.867 --> 11:24.500
- Poor Shane.
- Fuck that!

11:24.546 --> 11:27.010
I wouldn't blame Jenny if
she never spoke to Shane again.

11:28.198 --> 11:30.712
- That's little harsh.
- It was unforgivable

11:30.766 --> 11:31.940
what Shane did.

11:32.546 --> 11:34.360
Well, maybe it was wrong, but...

11:34.406 --> 11:37.371
- Maybe?
- Okay, it was wrong.

11:37.408 --> 11:38.743
It was devastating.

11:38.777 --> 11:40.541
After everything
that Jenny's been through?

11:40.588 --> 11:42.232
Poor Shane,
been through a lot too,

11:42.267 --> 11:44.063
and she's always been there
for Jenny.

11:46.088 --> 11:48.020
- Let's not talk about this.
- Let's not talk about this.

11:50.296 --> 11:51.932
No, fuck off!

11:51.975 --> 11:54.002
Why don't you just listen
to what she has to say?

11:54.106 --> 11:55.692
- Fuck you!
- I did have my keys!

11:55.718 --> 11:57.922
- Open the fucking door!
- They're my keys now! And now,

11:57.967 --> 12:00.040
you're gonna have to listen
to what we both have to say.

12:00.086 --> 12:02.461
There is,
there is absolutely no we.

12:02.498 --> 12:04.740
It's just me, it's just me.
I wanna talk to you.

12:04.786 --> 12:07.401
I want you both
out of my house, okay?

12:07.436 --> 12:08.823
Listen, let me just say
what I have to say

12:08.828 --> 12:11.282
and if you want me to go then,
then I promise I'll leave.

12:11.316 --> 12:12.393
Me too.

12:16.777 --> 12:18.252
Oh my god!

12:18.295 --> 12:20.022
Oh, poor Tiffy!

12:20.067 --> 12:21.060
Listen,

12:21.098 --> 12:24.240
I realize I've done a lot of
fucked up shit in my life,

12:24.285 --> 12:26.831
I acknowledge that,
but this is, by far,

12:27.696 --> 12:29.883
the most fucked up thing
I have ever done.

12:29.926 --> 12:32.030
But you cannot forget
that ten days ago

12:32.065 --> 12:34.043
you told me that
she was dead to you.

12:35.878 --> 12:37.643
- I did say that.
- And for some reason

12:37.678 --> 12:39.952
in my fucked up brain
that gave me permission

12:39.996 --> 12:41.962
and, and I know

12:43.026 --> 12:47.412
that breakups take time,
and you need that time to heal,

12:47.445 --> 12:50.093
and I know that
I've encroached on your time

12:50.128 --> 12:52.562
to do that and I am sorry.

12:54.475 --> 12:56.231
- So you tell me.
- Oh god!

12:56.278 --> 12:58.393
What can I do? I will eat dirt,

12:58.438 --> 13:00.810
- I'll crawl on glass, I'll be...
- Me too, Jenny.

13:00.848 --> 13:03.561
I mean I would even drink
that Spirulina disgusting stuff

13:03.607 --> 13:06.193
- for an entire week. I promise you.
- I'll be your assistant.

13:06.225 --> 13:09.071
I'll be your servant, I'll be your slave,
I'll be whatever it takes,

13:09.135 --> 13:11.220
but I want you to forgive me.

13:13.385 --> 13:15.322
I mean, Jenny, listen,
you know me more

13:15.367 --> 13:18.111
- than anybody else in this world.
- I do.

13:20.218 --> 13:22.553
You're my best friend
I've ever had.

13:24.068 --> 13:25.992
And I'm so ashamed.

13:26.025 --> 13:29.923
I'm profoundly ashamed
of what I've done.

13:32.866 --> 13:34.812
I need you to know that.

13:36.038 --> 13:39.950
My only explanation, and I promise
it is an explanation

13:39.977 --> 13:43.513
it is not an excuse,
is that I've been upset about Molly.

13:43.557 --> 13:45.600
Molly? Why?

13:45.636 --> 13:46.883
She...

13:48.068 --> 13:50.291
She gave me hope.
She... she... she...

13:50.335 --> 13:51.803
She inspired me.

13:51.835 --> 13:53.870
What?! She inspired you

13:53.918 --> 13:58.280
to fuck my girlfriend on
the balustrade of Yamashiro?

13:58.328 --> 13:59.430
I didn't fuck your girlfriend.

13:59.465 --> 14:00.971
Yeah Jenny,
she only ate me out.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.893
Oh, right, okay, of course.

14:02.936 --> 14:04.650
- I'm so stupid!
- Listen, if I knew for a split second

14:04.667 --> 14:05.782
she was your girlfriend,

14:05.828 --> 14:07.602
I wouldn't ever go near that.

14:07.637 --> 14:09.423
Listen to me. I understand...

14:10.878 --> 14:12.341
MUSIC

14:18.358 --> 14:20.561
Piece of fucking shit!

14:24.068 --> 14:25.480
Hang on a sec.

14:27.578 --> 14:29.823
Go fuck yourself!

14:30.206 --> 14:32.441
And the fuck out of my house!

14:34.518 --> 14:35.791
Jesus!

14:36.706 --> 14:38.661
What the fuck?!

14:39.865 --> 14:40.961
I think you're right.

14:42.127 --> 14:44.263
I think we probably
should break up.

14:49.687 --> 14:52.681
It's Max. He's back...
Oh, okay.

14:55.417 --> 14:56.522
It's off.

14:57.617 --> 14:58.910
It's off.

15:00.077 --> 15:01.960
We have nothing in common.

15:04.085 --> 15:05.623
It was exciting and hot to you

15:05.657 --> 15:07.223
when I was a soldier, but

15:07.256 --> 15:08.750
we have nothing in common.

15:09.465 --> 15:12.391
We don't have nothing in common.
Come on.

15:12.437 --> 15:15.390
Exactly, we don't have
nothing in common.

15:15.437 --> 15:16.150
It's stupid.

15:17.837 --> 15:18.743
What?

15:18.745 --> 15:19.993
It's true.

15:24.875 --> 15:26.811
We have things in common.

15:28.027 --> 15:29.332
Like what?

15:40.107 --> 15:41.250
We have this.

15:44.087 --> 15:45.811
Okay, what else?

15:49.678 --> 15:51.661
We have this in common.

16:13.065 --> 16:14.942
- No, no!
- What?

16:16.645 --> 16:19.431
I know we have all of this.

16:21.908 --> 16:23.720
But it can't be the only thing.

16:28.387 --> 16:30.311
Fuck her, right?
I mean, we tried.

16:30.346 --> 16:31.981
Shut up, Nikki.

16:32.016 --> 16:33.812
Why don't you just
come with me?

16:33.846 --> 16:35.141
I bought a new house
from the money I made

16:35.235 --> 16:37.451
from my last feature and while
my house is under construction,

16:37.476 --> 16:39.273
they're putting me up
in the Chateau.

16:39.608 --> 16:41.752
Come on, it'll be fun.
Seriously.

16:41.786 --> 16:43.282
I don't think so.

16:43.317 --> 16:44.680
Terrific idea.

16:44.727 --> 16:46.582
I'll let you know
when there is a good time

16:46.627 --> 16:48.841
for you to get the rest
of your stincky shit.

16:54.178 --> 16:56.640
And don't come back
when I'm here.

17:01.958 --> 17:04.182
Do you think
this thing's working?

17:06.535 --> 17:08.623
We have a fever, Pookie,

17:09.218 --> 17:11.362
and a nasty cold.

17:12.998 --> 17:15.512
Do you think maybe we should
give her some more advil?

17:16.454 --> 17:18.983
I don't know. It's been less
in the four hours.

17:20.546 --> 17:21.602
Go to sleep.

17:26.108 --> 17:27.141
I'll get it.

17:41.478 --> 17:43.372
God! Phyllis can be
such an asshole.

17:43.377 --> 17:45.793
- No.
- No, she had no right. Really.

17:45.876 --> 17:46.962
She had every right.

17:47.027 --> 17:48.971
Molly's her daughter.
She loves her.

17:49.016 --> 17:51.083
If I loved someone as much
as she loves Molly,

17:51.167 --> 17:52.911
I'd tell her not to
waste her time with me too.

17:52.995 --> 17:54.520
Oh, come on,
you're not a waste of time.

17:54.567 --> 17:55.582
Why'd say that?

17:57.255 --> 17:58.232
Thanks, Bette.

17:58.866 --> 18:00.513
Wait, so are you saying that

18:00.547 --> 18:03.522
- you love Molly?
- Yeah.

18:05.487 --> 18:07.970
God! I don't think I've heard you
say that since Carmen.

18:11.047 --> 18:12.632
I was faithfull to Molly.

18:12.668 --> 18:14.952
Really? Sorry,
I didn't mean to laugh.

18:14.958 --> 18:16.603
- No, you can laugh.
- No.

18:16.647 --> 18:18.783
No, it's just that

18:18.827 --> 18:20.321
that's big.

18:20.758 --> 18:22.273
It must have been hard.

18:22.315 --> 18:26.251
How hard is it to be faithfull
to someone that you're in love with?

18:29.565 --> 18:31.073
She's asleep.

18:31.076 --> 18:33.221
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, she's fine.

18:33.265 --> 18:35.210
She just has a really bad cold.

18:36.568 --> 18:39.092
Listen, I know you guys
have a lot going on with

18:39.126 --> 18:41.762
Angie and everything, but...

18:42.595 --> 18:45.071
Can I stay here tonight? I wanna
try with Jenny in the morning

18:45.118 --> 18:47.021
but I don't have a place
to stay.

18:48.126 --> 18:49.783
I'm gonna call William.

18:49.815 --> 18:50.800
Go for it.

18:50.847 --> 18:52.571
Right now. Yeah, I'll go.

18:55.696 --> 18:57.870
No, no, no, just stay. Stay.

18:57.908 --> 18:58.912
It's okay.

19:00.376 --> 19:02.382
Did you hear what happened
with the movie?

19:03.606 --> 19:06.313
- Aaron, apparently...
- Hi, this is Tina Kennard

19:06.357 --> 19:08.141
calling for Mr. Halsey.

19:09.445 --> 19:13.223
Yes, I know. I know
that it is very late.

19:15.555 --> 19:18.143
William? William, hi.
It's Tina.

19:18.145 --> 19:21.480
I'm so sorry to call you
in the middle of the night, but

19:21.485 --> 19:23.951
I just wanted to take the chance
to tell you

19:23.957 --> 19:25.282
how

19:25.287 --> 19:27.571
passionnate I feel and

19:27.585 --> 19:28.982
how strongly I feel

19:28.985 --> 19:32.050
that we do not sell out
to studio marketers.

19:32.096 --> 19:34.812
And they got him to agree
to reshoot the end of the movie.

19:34.815 --> 19:35.843
To what?

19:35.918 --> 19:38.741
Some heterosexist
Jesse goes back to Jim and

19:38.757 --> 19:41.292
decides she isn't
really lesbian after all

19:41.357 --> 19:43.992
- kind of ending.
-  You're fucking kidding me?
- No, I promise I do not call you...

19:44.028 --> 19:45.750
- This happened tonight?
- ... at 2:15 in the morning

19:45.795 --> 19:48.451
to berate you and accuse you
of being a sala.

19:50.176 --> 19:52.013
I'm sorry.

19:52.058 --> 19:54.873
Yes, I, I should have used
better judgment.

19:54.907 --> 19:56.081
I should have

19:56.117 --> 19:57.921
cool my jets and

19:58.417 --> 20:02.751
taken my time and called you
in the morning to make an appointm...

20:06.436 --> 20:07.672
Oh, my god.

20:10.077 --> 20:12.093
What? So,
you wanna sleep on our couch?

20:15.035 --> 20:16.312
MUSIC

20:26.177 --> 20:28.592
Okay. How about
"Porter-Peabody's"?

20:28.635 --> 20:31.123
No, no, no, no, no, sounds like
a porter party copy.

20:31.157 --> 20:32.233
No, sounds like,

20:32.275 --> 20:33.402
you know, no, no, no, okay.

20:33.448 --> 20:36.312
But I like the idea
of combining both our names.

20:36.396 --> 20:38.372
You know, bring them together?

20:38.405 --> 20:40.452
Kit, Helena...

20:40.498 --> 20:42.693
Kelena! Kelena?

20:44.708 --> 20:46.203
Okay, alright.
Well, the only thing

20:46.246 --> 20:47.700
that left is

20:48.707 --> 20:50.173
Kit, Helena...

20:52.018 --> 20:53.361
Hit!

20:56.618 --> 20:57.873
The Hit Club!

20:57.907 --> 21:00.222
- "Hit"! It's a Hit.
- It's a great name for a club.

21:00.265 --> 21:02.481
It's a hit, it's just hit me.

21:02.515 --> 21:04.503
- That's it!
- Girl it's hit club! Girl,

21:04.547 --> 21:05.520
where you been?!

21:05.558 --> 21:08.243
She's my best friend, Tina.
I didn't mean to hurt her.

21:08.286 --> 21:10.030
That is ass backward, Shane.

21:10.107 --> 21:12.142
You shouldn't meant
not to hurt her.

21:12.185 --> 21:14.232
You should think before you act.

21:14.827 --> 21:16.481
You're right. I know.

21:16.525 --> 21:17.621
You're right.

21:17.658 --> 21:19.093
The things you do in the dark?

21:19.127 --> 21:20.603
They have consequences.

21:21.008 --> 21:24.701
But, no one's saying that
what happened was OK, T.

21:25.537 --> 21:26.932
I think, maybe you,

21:26.967 --> 21:29.233
you might be
a little overjudgmental.

21:29.275 --> 21:30.831
- You're damn right I am!
- No, she's right.

21:30.868 --> 21:32.883
You know what? I deserve
everything you're saying.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.601
Well, I think that we all

21:34.637 --> 21:36.520
have to take in account,
you know,

21:36.567 --> 21:38.382
a lot of things, before we can

21:38.417 --> 21:40.231
judge anyone else's behavior.

21:40.266 --> 21:43.270
I think
your unwillingness to judge

21:43.275 --> 21:44.771
has a lot more to do

21:44.805 --> 21:46.480
with your own history
than any accommodation

21:46.528 --> 21:48.021
you might make for Shane.

21:49.746 --> 21:52.403
Well, that's what I was saying.
I mean, I was admitting that...

21:55.285 --> 21:57.031
Listen, you know what?

21:57.076 --> 21:58.533
I don't wanna get you guys
into this.

21:58.546 --> 22:00.782
- I'm gonna get outta there.
- Don't. Don't go. Stay.

22:00.817 --> 22:02.660
Really. Don't go. Stay, okay?

22:02.695 --> 22:04.593
I'm sorry
I've busted your chops.

22:04.625 --> 22:05.970
I am.

22:06.007 --> 22:08.001
It was my own stuff, okay?

22:08.036 --> 22:09.522
- Stay.
- T.?

22:09.565 --> 22:12.161
Please, stay, that's fine.

22:20.015 --> 22:21.942
I said attraction.

22:22.647 --> 22:24.340
It's not like it was
in a sexual way.

22:24.385 --> 22:26.163
It was we had things in common.

22:26.198 --> 22:28.883
Like we talked about things
that I like.

22:28.926 --> 22:29.923
Like what?

22:29.968 --> 22:32.563
Like we just talked easily.

22:32.596 --> 22:34.781
We had... we had this talkabout.

22:35.547 --> 22:38.091
You have to understand.
Nothing happened.

22:38.586 --> 22:40.080
I need you to hear that.

22:42.557 --> 22:43.902
Nothing happened.

22:45.647 --> 22:47.083
In fact, you know,

22:47.128 --> 22:49.130
I think I deserve
a little credit.

22:49.167 --> 22:50.893
Credit for what?

22:50.925 --> 22:53.013
For not doing
what every other lesbian

22:53.045 --> 22:55.421
would do in the circomstances.
I didn't cheat!

22:55.468 --> 22:58.012
That's a given, Alice.
You don't get medals for that.

22:58.047 --> 23:00.042
I'm not saying...
I don't...

23:00.078 --> 23:02.121
This is such a fucking trap.

23:06.015 --> 23:08.291
I know that you think
thinking is cheating, okay?

23:08.338 --> 23:10.092
That's the person
I'm dealing with.

23:10.135 --> 23:11.593
So,

23:12.055 --> 23:14.040
I'm trying to say

23:14.086 --> 23:16.942
let's be honest, okay? I'm trying
to give you some honesty.

23:16.986 --> 23:19.821
If we stand a fucking chance
in this relationship,

23:19.857 --> 23:22.663
we have to be honest.
We have to communicate.

23:24.325 --> 23:25.803
That's what I'm doing.

23:26.475 --> 23:29.940
I'm admitting that I had a moment,
like a moment!

23:29.975 --> 23:31.593
How much of a moment?

23:31.597 --> 23:34.133
It... like... nothing.

23:34.167 --> 23:36.251
Like a nanobig,
like a tiny moment.

23:36.296 --> 23:37.411
Like a mental...

23:38.315 --> 23:39.971
Let me just get rid of that.
Hold on.

23:42.716 --> 23:45.431
I mean, I didn't even
really kiss her! At all!

23:48.857 --> 23:49.733
What?

23:49.766 --> 23:51.433
No, I just... It's a bad time.

23:51.466 --> 23:53.173
- It's a bad time.
- Hi, Tasha.

23:53.217 --> 23:54.231
I was just...

23:54.275 --> 23:56.572
Listen. Do you two care
if I sleep on the couch tonight?

23:56.608 --> 23:59.281
What the fuck do you mean
you didn't even really kiss her?

23:59.668 --> 24:02.251
Maybe you can give her
some more of that good advice.

24:04.855 --> 24:06.682
Fuck! Fuck!

24:06.716 --> 24:08.253
Tasha, hold on!

24:08.296 --> 24:10.112
It's really bad, but
you can't stay here tonight.

24:10.157 --> 24:12.410
I'm so sorry. I love you so much
but it's really bad

24:12.448 --> 24:14.013
and you're not helping my case.
Will you lock the door?

24:14.056 --> 24:15.580
Okay. I love you. Sorry.

24:15.626 --> 24:17.130
Hang on the door!

24:19.477 --> 24:20.703
Where are you going?

24:20.746 --> 24:22.202
At a friend's house.

24:23.887 --> 24:25.131
Oh, my god!

24:36.036 --> 24:37.821
You know how to work this thing?

24:37.868 --> 24:39.023
Oh wait.

24:39.955 --> 24:42.782
I think I pushed it
too many times.

24:43.445 --> 24:45.992
It's so goddam complicated.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.273
Yes, this is Tina Kennard,

24:50.306 --> 24:53.382
mother of
Angelica Porter-Kennard.

24:53.918 --> 24:55.381
Four and a half.

24:55.427 --> 24:57.901
She's really high fever

24:57.946 --> 25:00.150
and she is very congested.

25:01.426 --> 25:02.822
Can you get a reading?

25:07.225 --> 25:10.083
104?

25:10.127 --> 25:11.770
104.

25:13.158 --> 25:15.173
Yeah, definitively 104.

25:16.948 --> 25:19.211
I think we should just go.

25:19.257 --> 25:20.183
- Okay.
- Now.

25:23.287 --> 25:24.492
I don't know where Shane is.

25:24.526 --> 25:26.172
I really... I tried to phone her,
but it didn't...

25:26.245 --> 25:27.633
I don't wanna do this over the phone.
Really.

25:27.675 --> 25:29.523
I don't know where she is.

25:30.368 --> 25:32.142
Okay, I don't know if you know
what happened

25:32.175 --> 25:33.521
and what my mother said, but...

25:34.395 --> 25:36.483
it was around us and

25:36.515 --> 25:39.643
Shane was completely justified
in the way that she

25:39.677 --> 25:41.351
behaved on me the other night
and I really,

25:41.407 --> 25:42.551
I really need to talk to her.

25:44.088 --> 25:44.962
I think

25:44.995 --> 25:47.202
probably what your mother
said to Shane

25:47.238 --> 25:49.112
was completely justified.

25:49.167 --> 25:50.502
My mother's a raging bitch

25:50.548 --> 25:52.003
and she destroys anyone
that gets in her way

25:52.048 --> 25:54.563
and I'm not gonna watch her
do that to the woman that I love.

25:59.035 --> 26:01.000
You know that it's
Shane's MO to make

26:01.048 --> 26:03.473
girls fall in love with her, right?

26:03.518 --> 26:04.471
Yes, I know that,

26:04.518 --> 26:06.361
but I also know that
what we have is different.

26:06.395 --> 26:08.733
Right. And then,
when girls fall in love with her,

26:08.766 --> 26:10.923
they want Shane
to be constrained

26:10.968 --> 26:12.970
into like a happy family

26:13.005 --> 26:15.352
and like a
marriage type of relationship

26:15.385 --> 26:16.660
and that's not gonna happen.

26:16.767 --> 26:18.522
Yeah. I don't wanna constrain her,

26:18.555 --> 26:20.553
I love her for who she is.
So if you could just tell me

26:20.596 --> 26:22.293
where she is or
when she'll be back.

26:23.636 --> 26:25.902
She's at the Chateau Marmont,

26:27.518 --> 26:29.331
and she's fucking Nikki.

26:33.445 --> 26:35.891
I... I don't know
when it started happening.

26:37.136 --> 26:38.282
I guess

26:38.318 --> 26:41.142
they were fucking around
on the Pink Ride or something.

26:41.188 --> 26:42.903
'Cause they were always

26:42.936 --> 26:44.603
going off together and...

26:45.336 --> 26:46.431
I don't know.

26:46.466 --> 26:49.810
I remember that Nikki said
she ran into Shane in the shower

26:49.846 --> 26:51.042
and Nikki comes back

26:51.076 --> 26:53.330
and she's still dirty
and she's not,

26:53.365 --> 26:54.561
she's not wet.

26:55.426 --> 26:58.111
Shane and Nikki hooked up
on the Pink Ride?

26:58.865 --> 27:00.172
I don't know.

27:02.575 --> 27:05.770
I don't know if there is
any point in rehashing this stuff.

27:05.805 --> 27:08.330
Molly, I do know that now
that Nikki and I are over

27:08.387 --> 27:10.801
Shane's gonna loose interest
and move on.

27:16.037 --> 27:17.143
This is her's.

27:17.178 --> 27:18.960
If you wouldn't mind
giving it to her. There's a,

27:19.537 --> 27:21.961
a letter in the inside pocket,

27:22.005 --> 27:23.511
in case
she didn't get to see it.

27:25.447 --> 27:27.600
If you could make sure
that she gets that.

27:38.515 --> 27:39.610
Thanks.

28:08.967 --> 28:11.170
MUSIC

28:28.696 --> 28:30.100
"In your eyes"

28:30.145 --> 28:32.863
"I see things I know
I can't touch"

28:35.585 --> 28:37.740
"I know not to reach for them"

28:39.576 --> 28:41.550
"I let them touch me"

28:42.986 --> 28:45.703
"And I cherish these moments"

28:46.987 --> 28:49.010
"That we're able to share"

28:49.645 --> 28:52.181
"However fleeting they may be"

29:52.365 --> 29:55.183
Once we filled up the form,
how long will it take?

29:55.228 --> 29:57.141
We'll do our best, M'ame.
What else comes in?

29:57.187 --> 29:59.360
She's burning up.
It's 3:00 in the morning.

29:59.398 --> 30:00.743
She's really hot.

30:03.037 --> 30:04.241
Which one of you is the mother?

30:04.278 --> 30:05.371
We both are.

30:05.415 --> 30:07.271
I need to put one name only.

30:08.588 --> 30:10.553
Are you kidding me?

30:10.588 --> 30:13.023
I can't process your paperwork.

30:16.227 --> 30:17.512
This is Los Angeles.

30:17.546 --> 30:20.110
There are same sex families
on every fucking street corner.

30:20.147 --> 30:21.541
She was born
in this fucking hospital

30:21.586 --> 30:23.452
and both our names
are on the birth certificate.

30:23.496 --> 30:24.583
So why don't you just
give us a fucking break,

30:24.587 --> 30:25.852
you bureaucratic magnet,

30:25.897 --> 30:28.121
and get our daughter
to see a goddam doctor.

30:29.665 --> 30:30.891
Please.

30:41.786 --> 30:44.082
This is incredible.
What are you doing here?

30:44.127 --> 30:45.311
What are you doing here?

30:45.346 --> 30:47.390
You know, we ate muchies.

30:48.145 --> 30:50.210
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

30:51.808 --> 30:55.520
You have nowhere to go.
So you're coming with us.

30:57.598 --> 30:58.322
Come on.

30:59.066 --> 31:00.350
See, look, tada!

31:00.388 --> 31:01.950
Wonderful goods waiting for you.

31:07.495 --> 31:08.941
Poor Shane,

31:08.987 --> 31:10.811
Jenny's so mad at her.

31:10.848 --> 31:12.753
What? Smile!

31:12.786 --> 31:15.313
Don't worry.
I'm gonna take care of you, okay?

31:15.357 --> 31:16.661
I don't want you
to take care of me.

31:16.686 --> 31:18.053
- Why not?
- 'Cause I don't.

31:18.098 --> 31:19.232
I can take care of you.

31:20.628 --> 31:22.762
Everyone else's mad at you
and I'm not.

31:24.468 --> 31:27.140
- Fantastic!
- Come on! Smile a little there!

31:27.188 --> 31:29.080
Isn't she sexy, you guys!

31:30.725 --> 31:33.493
Come on, Shane, relax!

31:36.408 --> 31:39.093
Oh, my god, it's Jenny.

31:41.927 --> 31:45.030
She said "If you still wanna
come over and see me, you can".

31:46.577 --> 31:47.811
Great.

31:47.848 --> 31:49.330
You think she's serious?

31:51.556 --> 31:52.712
I don't know, Nikki. I don't.

31:52.776 --> 31:54.773
If she texts you
and she says that,

31:54.808 --> 31:56.201
then yes, she's serious.

31:57.336 --> 31:59.320
I know but she's been so mean.

32:01.557 --> 32:03.952
I don't know what to tell you.
Just go.

32:03.997 --> 32:06.641
Just go, okay? Go, go, go.

32:06.686 --> 32:07.710
Are you gonna be okay?

32:07.758 --> 32:09.032
I'm gonna be fine.

32:09.065 --> 32:10.351
Just...

32:15.818 --> 32:17.391
Do you think she loves me?

32:17.438 --> 32:19.140
I don't know. Sure.

32:20.258 --> 32:21.251
Sure.

32:22.035 --> 32:23.633
Okay. Let's go, you guys.

32:23.666 --> 32:25.092
I'll text you later, okay?

32:26.568 --> 32:27.780
Come on you guys. Let's go.

32:45.507 --> 32:47.643
I am mortified.

32:48.328 --> 32:49.891
I'm just relieved.

32:50.407 --> 32:53.351
I just, I don't know how
I got the monitor to read 104

32:53.535 --> 32:55.562
when the temperature's 99.5.

32:55.608 --> 32:57.582
You know, I'm sure
it happens all the time

32:57.625 --> 32:59.992
with all
the tottering L.A. parents.

33:00.817 --> 33:03.093
That's one of the things
I love about you.

33:03.547 --> 33:05.663
Is that I don't know how to use
a digital thermometer?

33:07.888 --> 33:09.510
Because you appear
to the most of the world

33:09.517 --> 33:11.563
to be so Alpha and in control

33:11.626 --> 33:13.051
and

33:13.098 --> 33:14.451
I know how hard it is for you

33:14.527 --> 33:16.742
to cover up the panic
you feel inside.

33:39.848 --> 33:40.923
MUSIC

33:41.057 --> 33:42.470
Who the hell lives here?

33:47.208 --> 33:49.003
What the hell
are you doing here?

33:49.048 --> 33:51.811
I live here. Maybe I should
be asking you that question.

33:51.886 --> 33:54.890
But, you, uh... I thought...
You disappeared!

33:54.937 --> 33:56.600
I thought you left town or...

33:56.637 --> 33:57.833
got arrested by some cop

33:57.867 --> 33:59.960
who was pissed off
you slept with his wife.

33:59.998 --> 34:02.202
Okay, look who's talking.

34:02.698 --> 34:03.882
Oh, I didn't. I didn't.

34:03.947 --> 34:05.311
Did she tell you I did?
'Cause I didn't.

34:05.328 --> 34:06.291
Throw me the keys.

34:07.698 --> 34:08.760
I didn't.

34:09.585 --> 34:10.782
Can I come in?

34:10.824 --> 34:13.303
Hello? Can I...
Can I come in?

34:14.788 --> 34:15.822
I'm coming in.

34:20.487 --> 34:24.431
So, try to make yourself
at home, girl, but

34:25.327 --> 34:27.820
keep it down, 'cause I'm trying
to get some work done in here.

34:27.864 --> 34:29.360
It's 3:00 in the morning.

34:29.725 --> 34:31.471
It's when I do my best work.

34:35.688 --> 34:37.533
Oh my fucking god!

34:37.576 --> 34:38.590
Who's that?

34:38.636 --> 34:40.981
Oh, fucking Gabby Deveaux.

34:41.027 --> 34:42.351
I take it you know her.

34:43.297 --> 34:44.581
Can I have a beer?

35:02.016 --> 35:03.331
It's a twist off?

35:06.585 --> 35:07.322
Come here.

35:09.337 --> 35:10.541
Honey...

35:16.297 --> 35:17.162
I swear,

35:17.195 --> 35:19.133
I won't do anything
to make it up to you.

35:19.165 --> 35:20.480
We'll see about that.

35:25.487 --> 35:27.623
I swear, Jenny, I'm so sorry.

35:28.516 --> 35:30.951
Okay, I only did it with Shane,

35:30.988 --> 35:33.701
let her go down on me
because I was devastated

35:33.747 --> 35:35.101
- about you, Jenny.
- Shh...

35:38.095 --> 35:39.810
I'm so sorry.

36:03.005 --> 36:05.233
I swear. I never meant to do
anything to hurt you.

36:20.556 --> 36:21.802
I don't wanna loose you.

37:16.977 --> 37:18.633
Beautiful.

37:20.377 --> 37:22.252
You've got a problem with that?

37:22.295 --> 37:24.491
You've gotta admit
it's a little tacky

37:24.525 --> 37:26.900
It's her culture.
It's not tacky.

37:27.585 --> 37:29.313
Oh, come on.

37:29.358 --> 37:30.711
Look at the hat!

37:31.245 --> 37:33.873
There you go.
That's our problem.

37:33.907 --> 37:36.233
There's no problem.
I'm just saying.

37:36.275 --> 37:37.741
I'm not saying
you would buy this.

37:38.297 --> 37:40.281
- You know who have these?
- Don't mind us.

37:40.317 --> 37:41.601
Sandwich round.

37:42.566 --> 37:44.782
- You're a snob.
- What?

37:44.817 --> 37:47.170
You weren't like this
when I first met you.

37:47.206 --> 37:48.992
Actually, she was a wannabe.

37:49.027 --> 37:51.200
And now,
she's a wannabe with money.

37:51.775 --> 37:55.242
Ever think about investing in
a stylist with all that money, Alice?

37:55.277 --> 37:57.073
You need to watch your mouth.

37:57.118 --> 38:00.423
Ouh, Alice has a big butch daddy
to protect her.

38:00.468 --> 38:02.401
Can you give me, uh,
the liverwurst one?

38:02.418 --> 38:04.653
You sure that's liverwurst
I smell?

38:06.615 --> 38:08.962
I wonder if your friend knows

38:09.007 --> 38:11.561
that her girlfriend
used to be nicknamed "crash"

38:11.608 --> 38:14.352
'cause she would always show up
to parties she wasn't invited to.

38:26.017 --> 38:29.051
That's what my life
used to be like. Right there.

38:32.088 --> 38:34.241
You're the best person
I've ever met.

38:35.435 --> 38:36.641
You're

38:38.018 --> 38:41.311
strong, you're honest,
you're beautiful.

38:44.535 --> 38:46.232
I'm not ready to lose you.

38:50.856 --> 38:52.632
MUSIC

38:58.516 --> 38:59.973
Get your hands off of her!

39:00.036 --> 39:01.333
- Don't you touch me!
- What?

39:01.346 --> 39:02.810
I said don't fucking touch me,
bitch!

39:02.847 --> 39:04.162
What are you gonna do, huh?

39:04.207 --> 39:05.913
I swear
if you fucking touch me...

39:08.037 --> 39:10.213
Everybody keep their hands

39:10.256 --> 39:12.352
of everybody else in Hit Club.

39:14.227 --> 39:16.121
Unless they're loving hands.

39:22.508 --> 39:25.090
Can I have a drink?
Please?

39:28.656 --> 39:30.093
Make that two.

39:30.135 --> 39:31.280
On me.

39:39.695 --> 39:41.232
Women are poison.

39:42.625 --> 39:43.491
You know that?

39:45.095 --> 39:46.001
Two.

40:03.457 --> 40:05.640
I just wanna apologize.

40:06.806 --> 40:08.231
You already did.

40:09.705 --> 40:11.891
No, I mean for
defending Shane tonight.

40:11.925 --> 40:14.223
I feel like I might have sent
the wrong message.

40:14.976 --> 40:16.362
It doesn't matter.

40:16.875 --> 40:19.731
We just fall in two different sides
of this, that's all.

40:19.778 --> 40:21.140
It's fine.

40:22.727 --> 40:25.181
Given my history, I just,
I don't wanna be

40:26.026 --> 40:29.382
casual about the promise
that I made to you.

40:30.847 --> 40:33.293
I didn't know
you made any promises.

40:40.037 --> 40:42.630
Well, I'm making
a promise to you right now.

40:48.128 --> 40:49.732
I promise

40:50.366 --> 40:52.731
that I share your values

40:53.746 --> 40:55.693
about family

40:57.195 --> 40:59.011
and faithfulness

40:59.047 --> 41:00.823
and commitment

41:03.588 --> 41:07.261
and that I will never ever
cheat on you again.

41:21.715 --> 41:23.280
I love you.

41:51.516 --> 41:53.170
Come home with me.

41:54.617 --> 41:57.603
I promise I won't make
any gross noises like that.

41:57.636 --> 41:59.402
Oh, I'm not sleeping with you.

41:59.445 --> 42:01.610
Okay, fine, no sex tonight.

42:02.436 --> 42:04.291
No, I mean, I'm not even
sleeping in your bed,

42:04.336 --> 42:06.262
not until we figure some shit out.

42:09.295 --> 42:10.601
Whatever you say,

42:10.638 --> 42:11.342
fine.

42:17.728 --> 42:19.511
- What was that?
- What?

42:20.327 --> 42:22.020
It's my happy dance.

42:27.278 --> 42:29.283
You never make noises like that.

43:15.757 --> 43:17.470
Shane, baby girl.

43:21.548 --> 43:23.263
Hey, sweetie, come on.
It's time to go home.

43:25.438 --> 43:27.380
Hold on the... Yeah.

43:29.956 --> 43:31.031
I got it, I got it, I got it.

43:31.155 --> 43:32.552
Your arms are around my neck.
I'm gonna pull you.

43:32.558 --> 43:33.763
Please, put your...

43:37.667 --> 43:40.081
- Are you okay? You're okay?
- What time is it?

43:40.127 --> 43:42.223
It's time to go home.

43:42.256 --> 43:43.782
What are we gonna do?

43:43.826 --> 43:46.510
Come on, girl. One of us
has to take her.

43:47.626 --> 43:49.523
Okay, alright, I'll take her.
Come on.

43:49.528 --> 43:51.113
Come on, Shane,
you're going with me. Come on.

43:51.147 --> 43:53.080
Put your arms around...

43:53.127 --> 43:54.991
- Hang on, hang on, hang on.
- What time is it?

43:55.037 --> 43:57.903
Okay, it's time for you
to go home.

43:57.948 --> 43:59.491
Where is my bag?

43:59.527 --> 44:02.091
We... we got it, we got it,
we got it.

44:02.138 --> 44:05.091
- We got your bag, we got your bag.
- It's okay, it's here.

44:05.126 --> 44:07.860
Okay, let's go. See you tomorrow.
Come on, Shane.

44:07.898 --> 44:11.052
Come on. Put one step in front
of the other.

44:11.086 --> 44:13.250
Come on, you can do it.
One more step. Come on.

44:13.298 --> 44:14.702
Alright, good night.

44:18.058 --> 44:20.941
This is stupid. Would you
just come to the bedroom?

44:20.988 --> 44:22.233
Or

44:22.235 --> 44:24.272
let me sleep on the sofa
while you go to the bedroom

44:24.316 --> 44:25.620
'cause it's not fair, I mean,

44:25.665 --> 44:27.712
you don't have to be banished
from the sofa.

44:27.756 --> 44:29.682
This is fine. This is actually

44:29.728 --> 44:32.861
hundred times more comfortable
than half the places I've slept.

44:34.146 --> 44:35.132
Really?

44:39.656 --> 44:41.143
I never slept on that.

44:42.298 --> 44:43.351
Do you mind if I just...

44:46.567 --> 44:47.681
It's soft.

44:49.647 --> 44:51.263
This is nice.

44:51.766 --> 44:53.002
It's really good.

44:57.365 --> 44:58.783
What are you doing?

44:58.818 --> 45:00.392
What?

45:01.215 --> 45:04.181
It's a nice place to sleep
but I'm not currently sleepy.

45:04.225 --> 45:05.750
- Lay still.
- What?

45:06.406 --> 45:09.002
- Stop it. Just lay still!
- What? What?!

45:09.046 --> 45:11.010
- Lay still!
- But...

45:14.018 --> 45:15.872
Am I too scrummy?

45:15.887 --> 45:17.571
Yes, you are.

45:19.068 --> 45:20.061
- Turn around.
- Come on.

45:20.706 --> 45:22.571
That's it.
We're not doing this.

45:22.605 --> 45:23.923
We're not doing this.

45:25.506 --> 45:27.522
Not until we're sure
that we're gonna,

45:29.077 --> 45:30.642
that we're gonna stay together.

45:30.685 --> 45:32.192
I'm serious.

45:32.236 --> 45:34.931
Oh, I know you're serious.
Yes.

45:36.017 --> 45:38.241
- You're a very serious person.
- Yeah, and you're not.

45:38.285 --> 45:40.192
One more thing
we don't have in common.

45:40.235 --> 45:42.292
Wait a minute.
That's not true.

45:42.325 --> 45:44.683
- It is.
- No, I can be very serious.

45:44.685 --> 45:45.483
Really?

45:48.096 --> 45:48.860
Watch.

45:55.076 --> 45:57.183
Wait, you made me laugh.
Hold on.

46:01.097 --> 46:03.020
What's with the
flared nostrils though?

46:03.055 --> 46:03.971
Is that...

46:04.015 --> 46:07.073
- Is that part of your serious look?
- Listen, don't judge me!

46:17.566 --> 46:19.040
What are we gonna do?

46:19.507 --> 46:22.013
- Should go to therapy?
- Oh, hell, no.

46:22.047 --> 46:23.452
I'm not going to therapy.

46:23.488 --> 46:24.833
Why? What's wrong
with therapy?

46:24.846 --> 46:27.080
Therapy is for people
with problems.

46:27.117 --> 46:29.062
Oh yeah, so let's not
go to that.

46:29.676 --> 46:31.120
'Cause we're good.

46:34.397 --> 46:36.611
Alright. Well, maybe we'll see.

46:55.687 --> 46:58.260
Oh, I know, girl.

46:58.308 --> 46:59.713
I know.

46:59.746 --> 47:02.383
You did some damnit shit.

47:06.175 --> 47:07.561
I fucked up, Kit.

47:08.597 --> 47:11.283
I totally fucked up.

47:14.106 --> 47:16.450
It wasn't even worth it,
that's the worst part.

47:20.085 --> 47:21.822
It was such a waste.

47:21.866 --> 47:24.260
You know, Jenny,

47:24.295 --> 47:26.511
- she gonna get over it.
- No, she's not.

47:26.545 --> 47:28.402
- Oh, yeah.
- No, she's not.

47:28.447 --> 47:30.430
She's not gonna get over it.

47:31.207 --> 47:32.980
There's no way. She's...

47:34.177 --> 47:36.111
She's too delicate.

47:38.346 --> 47:39.623
She's way too delicate

47:39.658 --> 47:41.441
and I don't just mean
that whole movie thing

47:41.496 --> 47:44.230
with Adele and Nikki, I just mean
in general. She's...

47:46.458 --> 47:47.742
she's fragile.

47:49.116 --> 47:50.542
And the worst part,

47:51.658 --> 47:53.233
the part that makes me
the most sick is that

47:53.268 --> 47:55.143
I was probably the last person

47:55.187 --> 47:57.161
she would ever expect

47:57.447 --> 47:59.503
to do something like this.

48:01.448 --> 48:02.653
And I did it.

48:02.688 --> 48:04.472
Yeah, you did it.

48:05.938 --> 48:07.293
You know, it seems like

48:07.395 --> 48:10.503
her life has just been
one big ass-whooping,

48:10.545 --> 48:12.323
you know? It's...

48:15.938 --> 48:17.073
I know.

48:18.367 --> 48:19.930
It's so hot in here.

48:20.526 --> 48:23.130
- Why is that?
- Come on. Take off your socks.

48:24.538 --> 48:26.192
- Just, just relax.
- Fuck!

48:30.908 --> 48:32.012
You know,

48:34.935 --> 48:36.643
you know what you should do?

48:37.905 --> 48:40.483
- I can't do anything.
- Yeah, you can.

48:40.776 --> 48:42.701
You need to fight.

48:42.736 --> 48:44.393
You need to fight for Jenny.

48:50.526 --> 48:52.003
You see, you

48:52.048 --> 48:53.370
kinda just

48:53.415 --> 48:55.440
let all your women go.

48:56.506 --> 48:58.270
Carmen, Molly...

48:58.315 --> 49:00.191
No, no, Jenny's my friend...

49:00.235 --> 49:02.891
That's why you can do it.

49:02.927 --> 49:05.772
Fight for the friendship.

49:05.816 --> 49:07.613
Friendship.

49:09.247 --> 49:10.913
Let her know that you'll,

49:10.947 --> 49:13.681
you'll fight to the death

49:14.848 --> 49:17.492
to let her know
you're not gonna let her go.

49:17.536 --> 49:20.601
You're not gonna lose
this friendship.

49:30.036 --> 49:32.342
MUSIC

49:57.347 --> 49:58.653
Good morning.

50:05.407 --> 50:08.073
I'm so happy everything's okay
between us.

50:13.067 --> 50:15.153
God, you're so sexy.

50:20.816 --> 50:22.473
I love you so much.

50:26.136 --> 50:27.233
And...

50:29.088 --> 50:31.373
Last night, you know,
after

50:31.417 --> 50:34.043
everything
that happened with Shane,

50:36.076 --> 50:38.531
it was so romantic
when you said

50:38.578 --> 50:40.733
that I broke your heart...

50:44.797 --> 50:47.140
"You've broken my heart".

51:04.688 --> 51:06.540
You didn't break my heart.

51:08.377 --> 51:10.973
You're nothing
but a self absorbed,

51:11.017 --> 51:12.692
self-indulgent

51:13.167 --> 51:14.671
little brat.

51:16.576 --> 51:19.810
And our affair on set
was nothing but a showmance.

51:21.685 --> 51:24.273
And when I said
that you broke my heart,

51:26.716 --> 51:29.111
I wasn't talking about you, darling.

51:52.097 --> 51:53.503
It's time for you to go.

51:56.848 --> 51:59.091
MUSIC

52:08.018 --> 52:09.760
I'm moving into a hotel.

52:09.838 --> 52:11.322
Morning.

52:12.346 --> 52:15.102
Shane, why don't you come
sit with me at the counter?

52:16.067 --> 52:17.980
I don't want to have memories...

52:18.027 --> 52:21.743
No, it's okay. I got it.
It's okay.

52:25.545 --> 52:26.922
She's really pissed.

52:32.788 --> 52:34.103
Shane,
why don't you have a seat?

52:34.147 --> 52:36.493
If she sits there,
then I'm gonna leave.

52:36.545 --> 52:37.970
Jenny, come on.

52:40.308 --> 52:41.682
I'd like to talk to you.

52:41.735 --> 52:44.522
Do you,
do you guys wanna have

52:44.556 --> 52:45.893
a drink with me?

52:50.415 --> 52:52.661
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

52:59.388 --> 53:02.732
Helena, could we just have
some service, please? Thank you.

53:04.258 --> 53:05.752
You wanna sit down?

53:06.587 --> 53:07.692
Sure.

53:10.525 --> 53:12.972
- Where did you sleep last night?
- Kit's.

53:21.006 --> 53:22.822
Excuse me, ladies.

53:27.565 --> 53:29.561
- Do enjoy.
- Thanks.

53:36.225 --> 53:38.961
For you, an expresso.

53:38.998 --> 53:40.733
- You're sweet. Thank you.
- Tea.

53:55.768 --> 53:57.123
Come on, girls!

53:57.155 --> 53:59.530
You've gotta be kidding,
right?!
