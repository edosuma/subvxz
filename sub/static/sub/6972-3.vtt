02:02.000 --> 02:03.800
Oi! Easy!
Easy! Steady up!

02:03.900 --> 02:06.300
Hold on, mates. He's almost up.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.500
That's it. Give it a big pull!

02:09.100 --> 02:14.000
That's it. Don't drop him now. Come on!
Pull him over! Put your backs into it!

02:17.000 --> 02:18.900
Come on!

02:24.900 --> 02:28.500
There he goes. Lots of life in him.
Give it up, Matey.

02:28.500 --> 02:31.000
Good for ya. That's
what you get for your trouble.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.200
- Maybe he's just taking a long swim.
- Yeah. Or a short flight.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.600
You an airman, Mate? Oi?

02:37.600 --> 02:39.300
No, he's not dressed like an airman.

02:39.300 --> 02:44.400
What kind of uniform is that, then?
Sprechen sie deutsche, jah?

02:44.400 --> 02:48.400
I say he's a rat and we
throw him overboard like a rat.

02:48.400 --> 02:51.400
Right. Let's give him the heave-ho!

02:52.800 --> 02:54.000
Hey...

02:55.800 --> 02:59.600
How's about another dip
in the Atlantic, huh, dirty Jerry?

02:59.600 --> 03:00.900
Even the sharks won't eat him.

03:00.900 --> 03:05.500
Oi! What you got to say for yourself,
Jerry, before we throw you back in?

03:05.500 --> 03:07.300
My name's not Jerry.

03:07.300 --> 03:08.400
What's that?  Eh?

03:08.400 --> 03:10.600
My name's Mulder. Fox Mulder.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.600
That a name? Mulder?

03:12.600 --> 03:15.300
I got ID in my pocket.

03:18.700 --> 03:23.600
"Fox Mulder, Federal Bureau of Investigation."
Sorry, mate, never heard of it!

03:23.600 --> 03:27.700
- Never heard of it?
- Tell you what we do with foxes. Care to know?

03:27.700 --> 03:29.600
You never heard of the FBI?

03:29.600 --> 03:32.700
Why don't you shut up, Jerry,
before we change our minds here.

03:32.700 --> 03:35.100
- Where are you taking me?
- Where'd you pick up that accent?

03:35.100 --> 03:38.100
Probably in the Fuhrer's
Secret Service. Come on.

03:38.100 --> 03:42.400
- What are you talking about?
- I say we cut him open and see what color he bleeds.

03:42.400 --> 03:45.700
Dirty Jerry. Deutschland Uber Alles.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.900
"Deutschland Uber Alles"?
Wait a second.

03:48.900 --> 03:53.600
Oi, how's about you shove
a cork in it, mate. All right?

04:00.300 --> 04:03.700
Eh? What's this about?

04:03.700 --> 04:08.600
Found him in the water, sir. Don't know
nothing about him. I think he's a German.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.000
Bring the prisoner in my room.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.600
Friend or foe?

04:21.100 --> 04:24.800
- What?
- To what flag do you pledge allegiance?

04:24.800 --> 04:27.800
I think there's been a mistake.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.100
I think the mistake is mine.

04:31.100 --> 04:34.400
- Speak the truth, man.
- This is the Queen Anne, isn't it?

04:34.400 --> 04:37.500
Hey, just about enough of that.
I came looking for this ship.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.800
Say the word, Captain, I'll
make him the first of the rest.

04:39.800 --> 04:43.300
- Hold on a second. I think I can explain what's going on.
- It's a ruse, Captain.

04:43.300 --> 04:45.600
What's our current position?

04:45.900 --> 04:48.500
- Cut the spy up.
- I'll tell you. I'll tell you...

04:48.500 --> 04:53.400
We're two degrees above the 30th parallel.
Sargasso Sea. Just above the Tropic of Cancer.

04:53.400 --> 05:00.500
64 degrees West by Southwest. Off the Plantagenet
bank 60 miles South-southwest off Bermuda.

05:00.500 --> 05:05.500
- How would I know that if I'd been in the water?
- Aye, that's a damn good question, lad.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.800
I'm waiting for a damn good answer.

05:07.800 --> 05:11.200
Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me that you haven't
been able to get accurate compass readings.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.300
That navigation's been a real bitch.

05:13.300 --> 05:15.400
It's because you've been caught in
something called "The Devil's Triangle."

05:15.400 --> 05:18.000
I can show you on the chart here.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
It goes from Bermuda down to
Puerto Rico and back up to Florida.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.800
The Queen Anne is stuck here on the Eastern edge of it.
You've been caught in some kind of time warp.

05:27.800 --> 05:32.600
In some kind of limbo dimension and
now you've popped out the other side into 1998.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.200
1998?!

05:34.200 --> 05:35.400
This man is mad.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.000
Let him tell it to the fishes.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
I'm done fooling about, man.
There's a war on.

05:40.000 --> 05:46.100
And in it or no, I don't plan to lose me
mind nor me ship to the likes of a jackal like you.

05:46.100 --> 05:49.100
You can relax. There's no war going on.
The world is at peace.

05:49.100 --> 05:53.100
There's a little trouble over at our White House
but that'll blow over, so to speak.

05:53.100 --> 05:56.800
Peace? It's September 3rd, 1939, man!

05:56.800 --> 06:01.300
Hitler has entered Poland. And we've just been
boarded by a bunch of his goose-stepping hooligans...

06:01.300 --> 06:04.300
...so don't speak to me of peace, lad.
Tell Mother England.

06:04.300 --> 06:07.700
No, no. It's not September 3rd.
It's November 16th. Look.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.000
- Excuse me, captain.
- Aye.

06:10.300 --> 06:13.700
Sir, the Germans, sir.
They've taken control of the bridge.

06:13.700 --> 06:15.500
Steering a course for their homeland.

06:15.500 --> 06:19.500
Not on the watch of
captain Yip Harburg, they're not.

06:19.600 --> 06:22.100
Lock the prisoner up in here.

06:22.500 --> 06:25.800
It's okay. The war's over.

06:25.800 --> 06:29.000
Let them take you to Germany.
They make nice cars.

06:32.800 --> 06:35.700
This is unbelievable.

06:45.300 --> 06:48.900
Mayday, mayday. This is Special
Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI.

06:48.900 --> 06:51.700
I'm on the SS Queen Anne.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.500
Ship in distress.
Mayday, mayday.

06:55.500 --> 07:00.000
The British ambassador in Berlin handed
the German government a final note...

07:00.000 --> 07:06.200
...stating that unless we heard from them that they are
prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland...

07:06.200 --> 07:11.500
...a state of war would exist between us.
No such undertaking has been received.

07:11.500 --> 07:18.400
Consequently, as of today, September 3, 1939
this country is at war with Germany.

07:18.400 --> 07:25.800
Oh, sh...

07:25.800 --> 07:27.700
Hello?

07:29.100 --> 07:31.200
Hello?

07:33.900 --> 07:40.800
Closing of places of entertainment: All cinemas,
theatres and other places of entertainment...

07:40.800 --> 07:46.200
...are to be closed immediately until further notice.

07:50.600 --> 07:55.600
The evacuation of British children
is going on smoothly and efficiently.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.100
The ministry of health says that great progress...

08:18.700 --> 08:21.400
What the hell is going on?

08:21.400 --> 08:23.300
Spender?

10:45.000 --> 10:46.400
Hi.

10:52.300 --> 10:54.200
Excuse me.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.600
Scully?

10:56.600 --> 11:00.000
I suggest you get your Nazi paws off
me before you get one in the kisser.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.500
- Scully, it's me, Mulder.
- Oh, you speak English, do you?

11:02.500 --> 11:04.700
Well, how'd you like to see
the stars on the American flag?

11:04.700 --> 11:07.900
- I'm not a Nazi.
- Oh, sure. You just look like one, right?

11:07.900 --> 11:09.800
I had to steal this uniform. Scully?

11:09.800 --> 11:12.400
Here is the man you want.

11:15.700 --> 11:18.600
Halt! Hande hoch!
Hande hoch!

11:18.600 --> 11:20.500
He said, "Put your hands up."

11:22.000 --> 11:24.500
You see, I told you.

11:29.200 --> 11:32.100
Yeah, you're all big men now
but wait until you get into Russia.

11:32.100 --> 11:34.500
Hope you fellas like the cold.

12:24.300 --> 12:26.400
Same to you, Adolf!

12:52.900 --> 12:59.900
Turn this ship in the direction of Germany or
we will remove you from the wheel, understood?

12:59.900 --> 13:03.100
I'll not give up this ship!

13:03.600 --> 13:05.800
Show him what I mean.

13:05.800 --> 13:08.200
You can put me down, man, ...

13:08.200 --> 13:13.000
...but I'll not let go of this
wheel so 'till we meet in hell...

13:15.400 --> 13:17.000
Shoot him.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.400
No!

13:37.000 --> 13:38.800
You...

13:38.800 --> 13:40.600
Who is this man?

13:41.200 --> 13:46.900
He beat up one of my people
and stole his uniform. He is a spy.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.800
Where are the weapons?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.200
No sprechen.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.400
You have the weapons on board, no?

13:55.400 --> 13:58.100
I don't speak Nazi.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.500
Shoot him also.

14:00.700 --> 14:03.100
Wait a minute. Why are you shooting me?

14:03.100 --> 14:05.900
Why are you killing me?
What have I done?

14:05.900 --> 14:08.800
I don't understand what you're asking me.

14:09.100 --> 14:14.100
Stop! Don't shoot!
This man is American.

14:14.100 --> 14:18.200
They say more people want
to take part in the war...

14:24.300 --> 14:28.500
Bring him under.
Bring them all under.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.400
Skinner? Where are they taking me?
Help me, Skinner!

14:39.400 --> 14:41.700
What are you guys doing here?

14:41.700 --> 14:43.100
- Mulder's in trouble.
- Big trouble.

14:43.100 --> 14:46.000
- What do you mean?
- Let's take a walk.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.300
Okay, where are we going?

14:48.300 --> 14:52.500
- The walls have ears.
- I have ears. Will you tell me what's going on?

14:53.600 --> 14:56.000
- Mulder's disappeared.
- Disappeared from where?

14:56.000 --> 15:01.500
From the national reconnaissance office's
lacrosse mid-latitude imaging radar satellite.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.100
- I don't understand. What am I looking at?
- A whole lot of nothing.

15:07.100 --> 15:11.100
We pulled that down 45 minutes ago off the NRO
satellite, which early this morning sent a picture...

15:11.100 --> 15:14.400
...of a ship which inexplicably
appeared in the middle of the Atlantic.

15:14.400 --> 15:18.100
The SS Queen Anne which by all accounts
vanished without a trace over sixty years ago.

15:18.100 --> 15:19.600
The Queen Anne?
The British luxury liner?

15:19.600 --> 15:22.200
- That's correct.
- It was torpedoed by a German U-boat.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.200
- That's one story.
- There's another?

15:24.200 --> 15:27.600
Though her exact position was kept secret
for fear spies might give her up to the Axis.

15:27.600 --> 15:30.400
It's been reasonably determined
that the Queen Anne was just south...

15:30.400 --> 15:32.800
...of the Plantagenet bank when she went missing.

15:32.800 --> 15:35.200
Less than sixty feet of
water yet she's never been found.

15:35.200 --> 15:38.600
- So you're saying the Queen Anne just disappeared.
- Into the Bermuda triangle.

15:38.600 --> 15:42.000
And reappeared this morning
at 6:49 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.700
- That's impossible.
- Satellite doesn't lie.

15:43.700 --> 15:46.500
- There's nothing on here.
- We gave the original images to Mulder...

15:46.500 --> 15:49.000
- ...so he could use them as navigational aids.
- He was in a hurry.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.600
- To get where?
- Out to the Queen Anne before anyone else got there first.

15:52.600 --> 15:55.200
- He's gone out here?
- He went to Bermuda and chartered a powerboat...

15:55.200 --> 15:58.400
...out of Hamilton Harbor. We tracked him
on the satellite for an hour and a half.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.600
Until a storm blew in
and obscured all transmissions.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.900
- That's what you're holding.
- What's happened to him?

16:02.900 --> 16:05.800
We can't know that. Not without
alternative tracking data.

16:05.800 --> 16:08.200
- Which is why we're here.
- Without good data, all we can do is wait...

16:08.200 --> 16:10.400
- ...and hope for the best.
- Yeah, but expect the worst.

16:10.400 --> 16:14.800
- Well, we have to get help.
- Without a position he's a needle in a haystack.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.800
What do you need?

16:17.800 --> 16:22.800
Navy AWACS SLAR or SAR 100 K swath imaging.

16:22.800 --> 16:25.600
You're going to have to find
somebody at the Pentagon to get it.

16:26.300 --> 16:28.600
Wait for me downstairs.

16:36.100 --> 16:37.900
I need to speak with him.

16:37.900 --> 16:39.500
- Could you please take a seat?
- Is he in?

16:39.500 --> 16:42.700
- Yes, he's on his phone.
- Sorry, this can't wait.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.100
Sir?

16:44.400 --> 16:47.400
Could you hold on a minute?
What is it, Agent Scully?

16:47.400 --> 16:51.200
I just received some very disturbing
information, sir. I need your help.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.900
I'll call you back in five.

16:56.400 --> 16:59.300
- You can't come rushing in here.
- Sir, I couldn't waste time...

16:59.300 --> 17:01.900
- ...explaining myself to your assistant.
- Tell me what is so urgent.

17:01.900 --> 17:04.599
It's about Agent Mulder.
He's done something incredibly rash.

17:04.599 --> 17:07.000
- I can't.
- He may be lost at sea.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.900
- I can't, Agent Scully.
- You can't what?

17:08.900 --> 17:12.800
- I can't help you. There's nothing I can do.
- This isn't for me; it's for Agent Mulder.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.599
My hands are tied. I'm not
your direct superior any longer.

17:15.599 --> 17:19.800
- Don't you want to know what this is about?
- No, I don't. I don't even what to hear it.

17:19.800 --> 17:23.900
- Sir, this is about a man's life.
- I'm not allowed to have contact with you--

17:23.900 --> 17:28.800
- ...any contact with either you or Mulder.
- She walked right past me, sir.

17:31.600 --> 17:35.000
- You're out of line, Scully.
- No, sir, you're out of line.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.500
I'm sorry, but I'm coming to you for
help and I've got nowhere else to go.

17:39.500 --> 17:42.200
I would hope that after everything that we have
been through that you would at least have the...

17:42.200 --> 17:47.500
...courtesy and the decency and not to mention
the respect to listen to what I have to say.

17:47.500 --> 17:53.900
Now, all I need is information.
You don't have to do anything else.

17:56.300 --> 18:03.200
Look, sir, if you know anybody at the Office of
Naval Intelligence it would be of great help.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.600
I could lose my job, my pension, I could
even be subject to legal action.

18:15.600 --> 18:20.400
Use your head, Scully.
It'll save your ass.

18:20.600 --> 18:25.400
Save your own ass, sir.
You'll save your head along with it.

19:05.900 --> 19:07.500
Sorry.

19:26.600 --> 19:29.700
Yes, sir, I'll get those files and make that
call and buzz you when I have him on the line.

19:29.700 --> 19:33.100
- I need a word with AD Kersh.
- I'm sorry, he's not available.

19:33.100 --> 19:35.800
Assistant Director Kersh, may I
please have a moment of your time?

19:35.800 --> 19:36.900
A moment for what?

19:36.900 --> 19:40.000
Uh, may I, sir?
Thank you.

19:42.600 --> 19:47.900
Sir, I need you to get me some information.
I am not a liberty to say why...

19:47.900 --> 19:52.500
...but I can tell you it
is of the utmost importance.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.200
Yes?

19:55.200 --> 19:58.000
I, uh... Sorry.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.100
I shouldn't have come unannounced.

20:01.400 --> 20:05.200
May I see what you were
going to show me, Agent Scully?

20:05.500 --> 20:07.500
Uh...

20:07.500 --> 20:12.000
It's nothing, really.

20:13.300 --> 20:14.900
Good.

20:34.200 --> 20:37.800
What am I thinking?
What am I thinking?

20:40.200 --> 20:41.700
Sorry.

20:52.100 --> 20:54.300
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

20:54.300 --> 20:56.500
Answer the phone, Mulder.

20:56.500 --> 20:59.600
Answer the phone, answer the
phone, answer the phone.

21:03.500 --> 21:07.000
The cellular customer you are trying
to reach is not responding or is--

21:07.000 --> 21:08.500
Damn.

21:14.700 --> 21:19.700
I want you to do me a favor. It's not negotiable.
Either you do it or I kill you. You understand?

21:21.800 --> 21:23.500
- You okay, Agent Scully?
- No, I'm not.

21:23.500 --> 21:27.400
I'm a gun ready to go off so don't test me, Spender.
Don't even think about trying to weasel me.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.500
What is it that you need?

21:30.400 --> 21:38.600
Navy AWACS SLAR 100 K swath.
South-southeast of Bermuda.

21:38.600 --> 21:42.900
I am looking for a boat, maybe a ship.
1939 luxury liner.

21:42.900 --> 21:44.800
- 1939?
- Don't ask too many questions.

21:44.800 --> 21:47.400
I don't care what you do or who you
do or who you have to grease, ...

21:47.400 --> 21:50.400
...I need that information and I need
it now. Are we clear on that?

21:50.400 --> 21:51.600
Crystal.

21:51.800 --> 21:53.900
And, Agent Spender...

21:53.900 --> 21:57.800
If you're not back in a hurry I am going
to hunt you down, and so help me God...

21:57.800 --> 21:59.200
Right.

22:12.300 --> 22:13.300
Hello?

22:13.300 --> 22:14.900
Agent Fowley?

22:15.300 --> 22:16.600
Yes.

22:16.600 --> 22:18.800
I was looking for Agent Spender.

22:18.900 --> 22:22.500
I'm sorry, he's not here right now.
Is there something I can help you with?

22:22.500 --> 22:26.200
Yeah, Agent Scully just handed the
Assistant Director a piece of paper...

22:26.200 --> 22:28.700
...with an intelligence system scribbled on it..

22:30.100 --> 22:32.100
Yes?

22:33.000 --> 22:34.100
Yes, sir?

22:34.100 --> 22:35.700
Who is this?

22:47.800 --> 22:49.900
- Oh, Agent Scully.
- I was just, uh...

22:49.900 --> 22:53.400
- I was sent to come get you.
- Yeah, I was waiting for Agent Spender, he was, uh...

22:53.400 --> 22:59.000
- I'm supposed to pick up a delivery from him.
- Agent Spender is with Assistant Director Kersh.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.300
That rat bastard!

23:10.700 --> 23:12.300
Stupid!

23:13.800 --> 23:15.500
Scully.

23:17.600 --> 23:20.000
Mulder? Is that you?

23:22.600 --> 23:25.800
No, I can't...  I'm on an elevator.

23:25.800 --> 23:28.100
Hold on, I'll be off in a s...

23:28.400 --> 23:30.000
Hold on.

23:37.800 --> 23:39.300
Hello?

23:40.200 --> 23:41.300
No...

23:43.200 --> 23:48.000
I can't understand. I can't...

23:48.900 --> 23:50.800
- Was that you?
- Is it you?

23:50.800 --> 23:54.300
I've been trying to reach you.
I got the information you needed.

23:56.100 --> 23:57.500
How?

23:57.500 --> 23:58.500
Don't even ask.

23:58.500 --> 24:03.700
- Sir, what you've done...
- Is save Mulder's ass. I know.

24:04.500 --> 24:06.800
And if you ever ask me
to break policy or protocol...

24:06.800 --> 24:09.400
...I will have you written up, wrapped up
and tossed out of the FBI for good.

24:09.400 --> 24:12.000
- Am I understood, Agent Scully?
- Yes.

24:15.800 --> 24:17.400
Yes.

24:40.500 --> 24:42.100
Did you get it?

24:42.400 --> 24:44.000
Yeah.

24:55.800 --> 24:59.500
Oi... American, right?
Saved your life, mate.

24:59.500 --> 25:02.400
Krauts don't want no reason
to bring you Yanks into the war.

25:02.400 --> 25:05.100
I got two words for you,
buddy-- Pearl Harbor.

25:05.100 --> 25:05.700
What?

25:05.700 --> 25:10.000
After Poland, Hitler's on his way to Denmark,
Holland and France with a few stops in between.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.800
The French all but roll over on us,
the Italians seize their opportunity and...

25:13.800 --> 25:16.600
...the Japanese come through the back door.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.800
It's a long, bloody story.
It fortunately has a happy ending.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.800
- We win?
- Yeah, you come out on the side of history...

25:21.800 --> 25:24.600
...with no small amount of help from us.
Not much to apologize over...

25:24.600 --> 25:27.100
...the next 50 years except
for maybe the Spice Girls.

25:27.100 --> 25:30.000
Go on already! Go!

25:38.400 --> 25:42.800
Well... According to our host this'll
be our new accommodations, lads.

25:43.100 --> 25:45.700
You speak German.
What was that shouting about up there?

25:45.700 --> 25:49.500
They got it in mind that we
left America carrying arms to England.

25:49.500 --> 25:54.200
- Are we?
- Listen, she's drawing 16 feet at 81,000 tons.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.900
We're making 21 knots at full power.

25:56.900 --> 26:00.400
If we got munitions aboard this ship,
mate, they don't weigh but a few stone.

26:00.400 --> 26:03.700
But the Captain knew something.
He wouldn't give up the wheel.

26:03.700 --> 26:07.600
The Nazis boarded us after
they intercepted a radio communication...

26:07.600 --> 26:10.400
Some kind of code word
they keep asking about.

26:10.400 --> 26:14.500
Thor's Hammer.
You know what that is, mate?

26:14.600 --> 26:16.100
Who go there?

26:16.300 --> 26:18.700
I said, "who goes there?"

26:18.700 --> 26:21.600
Show your faces or we'll
bloody beat them to a stub.

26:21.600 --> 26:24.500
Put your irons down, boys.
It's your own crew, for God's sake.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.900
What're you doing down here?

26:25.900 --> 26:29.200
We're having a cup of tea.
What's it look like, you stupid swabbo?

26:29.200 --> 26:33.000
- Then who's steering the boat?
- Oh, just some blokes who answer to the name...

26:33.000 --> 26:34.400
...of Heil Hitler.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.600
You ever been to Germany, swabbo?

26:36.600 --> 26:38.800
They'll have a special affection
for the likes of you.

26:38.800 --> 26:42.000
- Yeah, right.
- Hey, this ship can't go to Germany.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
- Make up your mind, mate.
- They can´t happen.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.800
I got news for you, you're not carrying
munitions. It's something far more deadly.

26:47.800 --> 26:50.500
- Thor's Hammer?
- Thor's Hammer isn't a weapon. It's a man, ...

26:50.500 --> 26:54.200
...a man who will help build a weapon, a
bomb that'll win the war for whoever has it.

26:54.200 --> 26:58.700
- And you're telling me he's aboard this ship?
- I saw him in the ballroom.

27:06.000 --> 27:11.400
His name is Thor's Hammer.
He has a plan to build a bomb.

27:12.700 --> 27:15.300
Goodbye, mates.

27:15.900 --> 27:17.400
What's wrong with you?!

27:17.400 --> 27:22.000
Don't you know there are spies everywhere?!
Trust no one, mon!

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
Look, we've got to stop this ship-- now!
All right, lads, let's go!

27:33.500 --> 27:36.200
Hey, hey, who's in charge of this engine room?

27:39.700 --> 27:44.400
Oi, you! I'm talking to you.
Shut her down, man. We got to scuttle her now!

27:44.400 --> 27:45.700
Put some piss into her, boys.

27:45.700 --> 27:49.800
Hey, you heard him-- kill the engines!
There's no other way, swabbo.

27:50.100 --> 27:54.000
- You can't get to Germany if you can't steer.
- Me overriding her.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.400
We steering a course for home.

27:55.400 --> 27:59.100
Have you looked at your compass? You can't get
to England going the wrong bloody direction.

27:59.100 --> 28:02.000
We're not going to England.
We're going to Jamaica.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.300
Yeah!

28:03.500 --> 28:07.300
Listen, you steer her home, you bloody
ruffo, to her home where she belongs!

28:07.300 --> 28:11.200
Listen to me! Listen to me! You can't take
this ship to England. You'll never make it.

28:11.200 --> 28:13.800
What are you talking about?
I'm in charge of the wheel!

28:13.800 --> 28:16.200
- There's only one place she's going, Yank.
- Jamaica!

28:16.200 --> 28:17.800
Yeah!

28:17.800 --> 28:21.700
You can't take the ship to Jamaica, either. The Germans
will hunt you down no matter what course you steer.

28:21.700 --> 28:25.300
No! No! Hear it out.
Hear it out. Hear it out.

28:25.300 --> 28:27.000
- And who you be, boy?
- My name's Mulder.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.300
- He wants to go back to bloody America.
- No, I want you to take this ship and...

28:30.300 --> 28:32.200
...turn it back around the way you came.

28:32.200 --> 28:33.600
No! No!

28:33.600 --> 28:37.400
- Bloody hell, we're halfway home!
- You've got to turn the ship around.

28:37.400 --> 28:39.500
- And what's in that direction?
- The future.

28:39.500 --> 28:40.700
What?

28:40.700 --> 28:43.000
Actually, the past.

28:43.100 --> 28:46.600
- Oh, well, I'm convinced.
- Well, I can explain it to you.

28:46.600 --> 28:49.700
You! The American.

28:50.300 --> 28:53.600
You come with us, up here.
Yes, come with?

28:53.600 --> 28:59.200
Turn the ship around or Hitler rises, Germany wins
and your children will never know what freedom is!

29:17.500 --> 29:19.700
Stop! Stop!

29:20.200 --> 29:23.500
Stand still!
Stand still or I shoot!

29:23.500 --> 29:25.200
Stand still!

30:06.900 --> 30:08.900
Attention!

30:19.400 --> 30:21.200
Get up!

30:43.500 --> 30:47.200
There's a scientist on
board who can make a bomb.

30:47.200 --> 30:48.900
Who is this man?

30:48.900 --> 30:51.100
I don't know.

30:51.100 --> 30:53.500
Weapon ready.

30:55.900 --> 30:58.300
Tell him...

30:58.300 --> 31:03.500
We will kill one passenger
for every wrong answer.

31:03.800 --> 31:09.000
You will answer the question or
we will begin killing passengers.

31:09.400 --> 31:12.500
Which one is the scientist?

31:13.000 --> 31:15.500
I don't know.

31:17.100 --> 31:19.100
Shoot him.

31:45.500 --> 31:50.600
Ask him how many people he will let die?

31:51.500 --> 31:54.900
How many lives are you willing to sacrifice?

31:57.600 --> 31:59.800
None.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.700
Then you have the answer.

32:06.300 --> 32:09.200
He hesitates to name him.

32:10.300 --> 32:12.200
Shoot again.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.800
Stop!

32:20.500 --> 32:25.200
This man has no answers. You're killing
innocent people to learn that he knows nothing!

32:25.200 --> 32:28.300
Shut up.
Shut up and move away.

32:28.300 --> 32:30.300
Listen to me, you little weasel...

32:30.300 --> 32:33.400
We have our next passenger, a lady.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.100
Aim the weapon at her.

32:40.200 --> 32:46.100
Kill her, if he does not answer the question.

32:47.400 --> 32:50.100
Answer the question.

32:50.100 --> 32:53.400
I'll answer the question.

32:57.600 --> 33:00.000
Answer the question.

33:01.600 --> 33:05.100
That man is the scientist.

33:19.500 --> 33:23.200
Hey, Scully, you're not going
to believe this. Get up here.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.000
What?

33:27.900 --> 33:31.200
The sky just cleared and there it was.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.900
Is it the Queen Anne?

33:34.000 --> 33:36.200
That's her.

33:37.700 --> 33:39.500
I don't believe it.

33:39.500 --> 33:41.900
Seeing is believing.

33:44.900 --> 33:47.700
They've got power.

33:48.700 --> 33:51.300
Maybe Mulder's already on board.

33:51.300 --> 33:54.100
Let's hope he is.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.600
You're lying.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.900
- He's telling the truth.
- Shut up!

33:58.900 --> 34:02.100
- Who is the scientist?
- I told you, this man is the scientist.

34:02.100 --> 34:03.500
Officer!

34:14.199 --> 34:16.199
What is the man's name?

34:17.500 --> 34:19.800
John Brown.

34:20.199 --> 34:22.900
- Ask me again, and I'll knock you down.
- What's his name?!

34:22.900 --> 34:25.800
Puddintame. Ask me again
and I'll tell you the same.

34:25.800 --> 34:28.800
Wait. Don't shoot.

34:30.699 --> 34:34.000
- I'm the scientist.
- This man's a liar.

34:34.900 --> 34:36.100
I'm the scientist.

34:36.100 --> 34:39.000
Please-- tell them the truth
before someone else has to die.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.100
- I don't know this man.
- Please don't listen to her.

34:41.100 --> 34:45.000
She's traveling with me to
protect me. She works for the OSS.

34:51.699 --> 34:53.300
That's great.

34:53.300 --> 34:56.000
I don't see you did any better.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.900
Kill them first.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.300
Kill them all.

35:10.800 --> 35:13.000
What'd he say?

35:16.400 --> 35:18.700
Uh... I think I know what he said.

35:18.700 --> 35:20.700
You learn fast.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.200
What's happening?

35:34.200 --> 35:36.800
The engines shut down.

36:56.400 --> 36:57.700
Hey!

36:57.700 --> 36:58.400
Hey, what?

36:58.400 --> 37:00.400
- Come with me.
- Why should I?

37:00.400 --> 37:03.400
Cause you're the only
one who can save this ship.

37:27.600 --> 37:28.900
Come on.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.800
Stand still! Stand still.

37:35.800 --> 37:38.100
Or I will shoot you.

37:38.200 --> 37:40.200
Hands up...

37:41.400 --> 37:44.000
Behind your heads.
Do it!

37:44.000 --> 37:46.500
Now what, Einstein?

37:47.600 --> 37:49.500
Do it!

38:00.100 --> 38:03.500
God bless America.
Now get your asses out of here.

38:25.300 --> 38:27.600
Byers?

38:28.100 --> 38:30.200
Langly?

38:31.300 --> 38:33.300
Frohike?

38:45.300 --> 38:48.100
Come on... Come on!

38:55.900 --> 38:57.800
There you guys are.

40:02.800 --> 40:05.400
- What are you doing?!
- I'm going to tell you how to save this ship.

40:05.400 --> 40:08.300
- Out here?
- I can't stay. I got to get back to history.

40:08.300 --> 40:09.900
- What?
- And you got to rescue it.

40:09.900 --> 40:13.100
Wait. Listen to me. This ship's been caught
in something called the devil's triangle.

40:13.100 --> 40:16.000
It's some kind of time warp-- a rift in space.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.400
- Are you crazy?
- You know Einstein, right?

40:18.400 --> 40:23.000
He predicts the theoretical possibility. He also predicts
an atomic weapon that will destroy the world.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.100
Yeah? So what?

40:25.100 --> 40:28.100
If you don't go back and convince the
crew of this ship to turn this ship around...

40:28.100 --> 40:32.300
...and head back into the devil's triangle
everything Einstein predicted will become true...

40:32.300 --> 40:35.500
...except for the outcome of history.

40:35.900 --> 40:39.100
So, if I don't turn this ship around...?

40:39.400 --> 40:42.300
In all likelihood, I won't exist.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.700
And neither will you.

40:46.400 --> 40:47.600
Okay...

40:47.600 --> 40:50.000
So, in case we never meet again...

41:09.300 --> 41:11.300
I was expecting a left.

41:13.800 --> 41:15.100
Hey!

42:13.600 --> 42:15.300
Mulder?

42:20.200 --> 42:22.400
Mulder, it's me.

42:23.600 --> 42:26.900
- Where am I?
- You're in a hospital.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.900
- Lie still.
- I feel... Like hell.

42:30.900 --> 42:34.500
I don't blame you. You've been
through the wringer, I'd say.

42:34.500 --> 42:36.300
What happened to me?

42:36.300 --> 42:40.000
You did something incredibly stupid.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.100
What did I do?

42:42.100 --> 42:45.500
You went looking for a ship, Mulder.

42:45.500 --> 42:48.600
In the Bermuda Triangle.

42:49.100 --> 42:52.700
- Say that again?
- Gilligan awakes.

42:53.400 --> 42:55.400
You were there.

42:55.600 --> 42:58.000
- You were there, Scully.
- He's delirious.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.100
- And he was there, too.
- Right... Me and my dog Toto.

43:01.100 --> 43:05.100
- No, you were there with the Nazis.
- Mulder, will you settle down? It's an order.

43:05.100 --> 43:06.600
Not that he takes orders...

43:06.600 --> 43:11.200
- You saved the world, Scully.
- Yeah... You're right. I did.

43:11.200 --> 43:13.400
- What kind of drugs is he on?
- I want some.

43:13.400 --> 43:16.400
No, no, no.... The Queen Anne-- I found it.
You were there with Thor's Hammer.

43:16.400 --> 43:19.500
I told you you had to turn the ship
around and then I jumped overboard.

43:19.500 --> 43:24.600
Yeah, I bet you did. The boat that you
were on was busted into a million pieces.

43:24.600 --> 43:29.300
And as for the Queen Anne it was
nothing more than a ghost ship.

43:29.300 --> 43:35.700
No, no, no. You and I were
on that ship, Scully. In 1939.

43:36.900 --> 43:39.400
Get some rest, Mulder,
'cause when you get out of here...

43:39.400 --> 43:42.600
...I'm going to kick your butt but good.

43:45.500 --> 43:51.500
I would've never seen you again.
But you believed me.

43:52.700 --> 43:55.600
In your dreams.

43:56.400 --> 44:04.200
Mulder, I want you to close your eyes and I want you
to think to yourself "there's no place like home."

44:07.200 --> 44:09.200
Hey, Scully.

44:12.800 --> 44:14.700
Yes?

44:19.100 --> 44:21.600
I love you.

44:21.600 --> 44:23.700
Oh, brother...

44:24.305 --> 44:30.505
