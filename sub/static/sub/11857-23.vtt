WEBVTT

00:05.125 --> 00:06.166
You got another
headache?

00:06.250 --> 00:07.291
It's nothing.

00:07.375 --> 00:08.917
Got a new one
for the overrated list.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.166
May even surpass
Kurt Cobain.

00:11.250 --> 00:12.542
More overrated
than
the Mona Lisa?

00:12.625 --> 00:14.208
Definitely.
Frank Lloyd Wright?

00:14.291 --> 00:17.083
Why is he the architect
who gets to be famous?

00:19.041 --> 00:20.583
(male #1)
'What the hell is this?'

00:20.667 --> 00:22.417
I'm supposed to be on a plane
to Houston. I've got a car--

00:22.500 --> 00:25.166
I came to you
15 years ago for a job.

00:25.250 --> 00:26.333
Know what you said?

00:26.417 --> 00:27.625
I don't have time
for this crap.

00:27.709 --> 00:29.125
Sit down, Harvey.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.542
You said I was
a state college punk.

00:33.625 --> 00:36.291
'Said you only took Wharton,
Ivy League guys.'

00:36.375 --> 00:38.083
'Basically called me a loser.'

00:38.166 --> 00:40.083
I'm a lot of things,
but a loser I ain't.

00:40.166 --> 00:41.291
- Your point?
- Point is

00:41.375 --> 00:43.125
I just got off the phone
with your board.

00:43.208 --> 00:45.834
They've agreed to a buyout
offer
I made last night.

00:45.917 --> 00:49.750
- What?
- I now own 51% of your company.

00:49.834 --> 00:53.417
That means this state college
loser is your boss.

00:53.500 --> 00:56.792
Guess what?
You're fired, Harv.

00:56.875 --> 00:57.959
Now, as for
the rest of you

00:58.041 --> 00:59.667
on Harvey's team,
don't worry.

00:59.750 --> 01:01.375
I'm sure you can find
a new home

01:01.458 --> 01:04.041
for your malaise
and incompetence.

01:04.125 --> 01:06.125
[seagull cawing]
As for..

01:08.667 --> 01:10.458
How the hell did
a seagull get in here?

01:15.792 --> 01:17.750
You okay?

01:23.208 --> 01:24.959
Excuse me.

01:28.083 --> 01:29.667
- What are you doing here?
- You ever gonna call home,
Jay?

01:29.750 --> 01:32.166
Busy paying for your next
trip to Cabo, Buttercup.

01:32.250 --> 01:34.500
So you still haven't talked
to Dr. Lason about your tests?

01:34.583 --> 01:36.417
No.

01:36.500 --> 01:38.000
I did.

01:38.083 --> 01:40.375
It's bad news, Jay.

01:40.458 --> 01:42.291
It's the worst.

02:22.375 --> 02:25.250
Everyone's talking
about you and that ADA.

02:25.333 --> 02:26.834
Now, what's to talk about?

02:26.917 --> 02:29.208
How much you guys
hate each other.

02:29.291 --> 02:30.375
That's right,
we do.

02:30.458 --> 02:32.333
Mm-hmm.

02:32.417 --> 02:33.834
What?

02:35.125 --> 02:36.166
Morning, boss.

02:36.250 --> 02:37.458
Morning. What'd the ME want?

02:37.542 --> 02:39.083
Ever hear
of Larry Kenick?

02:39.166 --> 02:41.917
So-called Angel of Death nurse?
Jackson Hospital.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.625
Just fessed up to killing
six dying patients

02:43.709 --> 02:44.917
in the last decade.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.041
Yeah, took 'em out
with heavy doses of morphine.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.500
Now Frannie's
reviewing
all the other deaths

02:48.583 --> 02:49.834
happened on his watch.

02:49.917 --> 02:52.041
- She find something?
- Guy named Jay Dratton.

02:52.125 --> 02:53.750
40 years old, brain tumor.

02:53.834 --> 02:55.583
'Died weeks
before anticipated.'

02:55.667 --> 02:57.291
Frannie thinks
his narcotic levels

02:57.375 --> 02:58.792
were on the high side.

02:58.875 --> 03:01.291
And Kenick was his nurse
when he suddenly flatlined.

03:01.375 --> 03:03.792
So maybe he was the
angel's seventh victim?

03:03.875 --> 03:06.166
Or someone really had it
in for this Dratton.

03:06.250 --> 03:09.792
Otherwise, why kill someone
who's literally on his
deathbed?

03:48.375 --> 03:50.750
(Lilly)
'Where are you going, mom?'

03:50.834 --> 03:52.166
'Bars are closed.'

03:54.125 --> 03:55.792
Mom, the doctor said
if you drink any more

03:55.875 --> 03:57.291
you're going to die.

03:57.375 --> 03:59.291
'It's that simple.'

03:59.375 --> 04:01.792
Doctor has it backwards.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.125
I die if I don't.

04:04.959 --> 04:06.375
You're staying here.

04:06.458 --> 04:08.041
Don't bully me, Lilly.
I'm your mother.

04:08.125 --> 04:09.625
I'm not a murder suspect.

04:09.709 --> 04:12.333
I always wondered who that drunk
woman was driving me to school.

04:12.417 --> 04:14.583
Well, maybe you should have
asked your father for a ride.

04:14.667 --> 04:17.041
If you hadn't
sent him packin'.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.166
He left.

04:20.250 --> 04:21.792
I stayed.

04:23.041 --> 04:25.834
Remember you used to have
those bad dreams?

04:25.917 --> 04:29.166
I would read to you all night
just to calm you down.

04:29.250 --> 04:30.625
I was there, Lilly.

04:30.709 --> 04:33.250
And now you're
just
making stuff up.

04:35.208 --> 04:38.000
My mother used to work so hard.

04:38.083 --> 04:39.792
Eight hours a day
at a department store

04:39.875 --> 04:43.667
and then back home,
make dinner for us.

04:43.750 --> 04:46.291
I was always so proud of her.

04:48.250 --> 04:50.125
I'll make some tea.

04:50.208 --> 04:52.500
I'll stay
with
you a
while.

04:53.667 --> 04:55.583
I'm gonna do
what I want, Lilly.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.250
You can't push me around.

05:10.792 --> 05:12.792
Fine. You want to kill yourself?

05:12.875 --> 05:14.917
There's nothing
I can do to stop you.

05:27.792 --> 05:31.458
Jay Dratton, hedge fund
manager,
self-made millionaire.

05:31.542 --> 05:33.250
Living the good life
in Bucks County.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.083
Beautiful wife,
beautiful house.

05:35.166 --> 05:36.542
Then cancer hits.

05:36.625 --> 05:38.834
Two months after the
diagnosis,
guy's on his deathbed.

05:38.917 --> 05:41.583
And he couldn't take those
beautiful millions with him.

05:41.667 --> 05:42.875
Anything hinky in the will?

05:42.959 --> 05:44.542
No. Wife and son's
got it all.

05:44.625 --> 05:46.667
Nurse found an open notebook
at Jay's bedside.

05:46.750 --> 05:48.000
The name Louise on it.

05:48.083 --> 05:49.875
Girlfriend on the side.

05:49.959 --> 05:52.500
So far, no luck tracking down
any Louises connected to him.

05:52.583 --> 05:54.125
Well, Scotty and Lill are
out
at Chester Prison

05:54.208 --> 05:56.625
starting with the good nurse
Kenick.

05:56.709 --> 05:58.583
Hope they don't cough
around him.

06:08.667 --> 06:10.750
You know,
my granddad had ALS.

06:10.834 --> 06:13.792
He was a boxer, couldn't hold
up
a spoon in the end.

06:13.875 --> 06:15.083
- Oh, yeah?
- 'Yeah.'

06:15.166 --> 06:16.750
Suffered for weeks
before he died.

06:16.834 --> 06:18.000
Still don't know
the point of that.

06:18.083 --> 06:19.834
Hmm. There's always
hope, right?

06:19.917 --> 06:22.583
Well, you know you can put down
a dog if it's in pain?

06:22.667 --> 06:24.709
Or a cat. Yeah.

06:24.792 --> 06:26.291
Why not us?

06:29.041 --> 06:31.083
(Scotty)
'You like playing God,
Larry?'

06:31.166 --> 06:34.083
No, but you know
what I do like?

06:34.166 --> 06:35.291
Dignity.

06:35.375 --> 06:37.291
I've seen men scream
when they lose it.

06:37.375 --> 06:40.083
Seen women beg to die with it
while they still can.

06:40.166 --> 06:41.959
Well, two of the six people
you killed were in a coma.

06:42.041 --> 06:43.792
They weren't begging
for anything.

06:43.875 --> 06:45.583
Their brains were cabbage.

06:45.667 --> 06:46.834
No chance of recovery.

06:46.917 --> 06:48.792
That how you felt
about Jay Dratton?

06:48.875 --> 06:51.333
No. Jay was something else.

06:51.417 --> 06:52.834
'If anyone was going
to beat cancer'

06:52.917 --> 06:55.458
by sheer willpower,
it was that guy.

06:55.542 --> 06:57.458
But he was losing, in pain.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.291
The patient records
show
you checked on him

06:59.375 --> 07:00.583
an hour before he died.

07:00.667 --> 07:01.750
Probably.

07:01.834 --> 07:03.500
Then I left
to make other rounds.

07:03.583 --> 07:04.959
While the morphine
kicked in.

07:05.041 --> 07:06.166
No.

07:06.250 --> 07:08.166
I helped people
who had lost their will.

07:08.250 --> 07:10.250
Jay had nothing but will.

07:10.333 --> 07:13.250
So you being his nurse
that night, just coincidence?

07:13.333 --> 07:17.000
Lady, I've confessed to helping
six people pass on with dignity.

07:17.083 --> 07:18.500
I got nothing to hide.

07:18.583 --> 07:21.333
He ever mention
someone named Louise?

07:21.417 --> 07:22.667
Not to me.

07:22.750 --> 07:25.709
But he and I weren't
exactly chatty.

07:25.792 --> 07:29.333
First day I saw the guy,
I knew to back off.

07:30.834 --> 07:34.709
Well, Jay, you have a grade IV
glioblastoma multiforme--

07:34.792 --> 07:37.917
In English, please.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.750
Tell it
like it is, Doc.

07:40.834 --> 07:43.625
You have
a tennis ball-size tumor

07:43.709 --> 07:44.792
in the back of your head.

07:44.875 --> 07:46.333
(Jay)
'Okay.'

07:46.417 --> 07:47.542
So we cut it out.

07:47.625 --> 07:49.750
It's in an inaccessible area.

07:50.834 --> 07:52.250
'You wouldn't, uh..'

07:52.333 --> 07:54.834
Spit it out.
I wouldn't survive the
surgery?

07:54.917 --> 07:56.000
That's right.

07:56.083 --> 07:58.208
Chemo. Radiation.

07:58.291 --> 07:59.667
(male #1)
'Treatment
isn't an option.'

07:59.750 --> 08:01.208
The cancer has spread
to your spine.

08:01.291 --> 08:04.166
'At best, you have
three months to live.'

08:04.250 --> 08:06.875
This is, uh,
Larry Kenick

08:06.959 --> 08:08.625
'a nurse in our
hospice program.'

08:08.709 --> 08:10.208
'He'll be at your
beck and call.'

08:10.291 --> 08:11.792
Uh, what can we expect
to happen?

08:11.875 --> 08:14.333
Short-term memory loss,
confusion.

08:14.417 --> 08:16.041
Maybe hallucinations.

08:19.166 --> 08:22.041
Is this what they teach
in medical school?

08:22.125 --> 08:24.750
- I'm sorry?
- Giving up like France?

08:24.834 --> 08:26.083
You said tell it like it is.

08:26.166 --> 08:28.959
I did...and I will.

08:29.041 --> 08:30.500
I'm going to beat this.

08:30.583 --> 08:32.583
It's a simple fact,
like today's Tuesday.

08:32.667 --> 08:35.709
Like your golf tie
is absurd and inappropriate.

08:35.792 --> 08:38.166
'I know guys
who have survived cancer.'

08:38.250 --> 08:39.667
'The key is attitude.'

08:39.750 --> 08:42.083
Defeat ain't an option.
It's non-negotiable.

08:42.166 --> 08:43.792
I'm not saying
give up hope.

08:43.875 --> 08:45.625
Then hope it is.

08:47.125 --> 08:49.917
Put me through the most
aggressive treatment possible.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.417
Go crazy.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.959
Write a paper about me.

08:54.041 --> 08:56.542
I'm sorry
I don't have better
news.

08:59.250 --> 09:01.834
Jay, why do this to yourself?

09:01.917 --> 09:04.500
Gee, honey, I was sort of
hoping
you'd want me to live.

09:04.583 --> 09:05.875
That's not what I'm saying.

09:05.959 --> 09:07.041
Bet you're
shopping
for black dresses

09:07.125 --> 09:08.125
in your head right now.

09:08.208 --> 09:09.458
- Jay!
- What looks better

09:09.542 --> 09:11.834
with crocodile
tears,
Armani or Gucci?

09:11.917 --> 09:15.000
Admit it, you're
rooting
for the cancer.

09:16.083 --> 09:18.500
Cancer can't get you
fast enough, Jay.

09:18.583 --> 09:20.792
I hope it hurts.

09:24.166 --> 09:25.792
Jay always that combative?

09:25.875 --> 09:27.333
Not to mention
the wife.

09:27.417 --> 09:30.458
Classic rich couple.
Had everything, still
miserable.

09:30.542 --> 09:32.417
Your alibi sucks, Kenick.

09:32.500 --> 09:35.750
We might be back to hear a
little more about dignity.

09:35.834 --> 09:38.166
Oh, I'll be here.

09:38.250 --> 09:40.834
The loving wife inherited
three million bucks, right?

09:40.917 --> 09:43.500
Maybe the cancer didn't
move fast enough for
her.

09:47.542 --> 09:49.583
Sounds like you
and your husband hated the
sight

09:49.667 --> 09:50.917
'of each other,
Caroline.'

09:53.291 --> 09:55.834
Wasn't how it always was,
but it's how we ended up.

09:55.917 --> 09:58.125
Then he gets cancer,
vows to fight it.

09:58.208 --> 10:01.208
Jay grew up poor in Fishtown.
He liked to fight.

10:01.291 --> 10:04.375
And maybe you liked the idea
of being a merry widow.

10:04.458 --> 10:05.792
The sooner the better.

10:05.875 --> 10:07.458
(Nick)
'So you helped
the cancer along.'

10:07.542 --> 10:09.333
If I hated Jay that much,
I would've let him suffer

10:09.417 --> 10:10.583
not end his pain.

10:10.667 --> 10:12.458
Three million bucks
says maybe not.

10:12.542 --> 10:14.959
The name Louise mean anything
to you, Caroline?

10:15.041 --> 10:16.500
'No.'

10:16.583 --> 10:19.792
I know Jay wrote that down,
but he wasn't lucid in the
end.

10:19.875 --> 10:22.291
And were you
with him at the end?

10:22.375 --> 10:24.041
I was at home with my son.

10:24.125 --> 10:25.667
He was grounded.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.041
Guy like Jay,
with his love of fighting

10:27.125 --> 10:28.417
must have had his share
of run-ins.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.083
It was a daily thing with him.

10:30.166 --> 10:32.542
Racked up a lot of enemies?

10:32.625 --> 10:35.667
Right into his final days.

10:35.750 --> 10:39.208
(Jay)
'Uh-huh.
No, listen.'

10:39.291 --> 10:41.208
Listen to me.

10:41.291 --> 10:43.709
Our offer's not changing.

10:43.792 --> 10:46.458
We got to negotiate
with strength.

10:46.542 --> 10:48.667
What are you
so afraid of, Phil?

10:50.000 --> 10:51.542
Hang on. Other line.

10:54.875 --> 10:56.083
Phil?

10:56.166 --> 10:59.083
Yeah, your balls were
on the other line.

10:59.166 --> 11:02.000
- They miss you.
- Yo. Mind keeping it down?

11:02.083 --> 11:03.333
I'm trying to give my kid
some medicine.

11:03.417 --> 11:04.709
Call you back.

11:04.792 --> 11:06.375
Rumor is, sick people
need peace and quiet.

11:06.458 --> 11:07.834
You're making my daughter
feel worse.

11:07.917 --> 11:10.041
And I'm on my second round
of chemo

11:10.125 --> 11:11.834
and I'm walking off
a puking spell.

11:11.917 --> 11:14.000
- So you have to do it here?
- The hallway isn't public?

11:14.083 --> 11:16.917
Oh, alright.
I'm asking you nice.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.417
Ask any way you like,
Chiquita.

11:18.500 --> 11:21.875
I'll walk where
I want to.

11:21.959 --> 11:23.250
(Jay)
'Sand.'

11:30.375 --> 11:32.959
Sand? What are you
talking about?

11:33.041 --> 11:35.125
Headache, that's all.

11:36.709 --> 11:38.625
By the way, lady

11:38.709 --> 11:41.750
your daughter
cries all night.

11:41.834 --> 11:45.417
Could you ask her
to keep it down?

11:45.500 --> 11:48.500
So that's why no
one
comes to see you.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.542
- Excuse me?
- Your best friend is a phone

11:50.625 --> 11:52.125
and when your wife
was here last time

11:52.208 --> 11:54.583
she looked annoyed as hell
that you were still alive.

11:54.667 --> 11:56.125
Thanks for your observation.

11:56.208 --> 11:58.208
No one's gonna give
a rat's ass when you're gone.

11:58.291 --> 11:59.834
Dying alone's got
to be the worst kind of
death.

11:59.917 --> 12:03.542
No. The worst kind of death
is dying poor in a Target
shirt.

12:05.583 --> 12:08.458
You should be the one
about to pass away.

12:08.542 --> 12:10.375
Not my daughter.

12:15.709 --> 12:18.166
Her daughter
had cancer, too?

12:18.250 --> 12:19.792
Brain tumor.
Like Jay.

12:19.875 --> 12:23.083
And she was helping
with the girl's medication?

12:23.166 --> 12:24.500
A lot of parents
do that.

12:24.583 --> 12:25.750
Less scary for the child.

12:25.834 --> 12:28.041
So, Amelia was handy
with a needle.

12:28.125 --> 12:32.709
If she could give morphine
to her daughter, why not Jay?

12:43.542 --> 12:44.792
What's up?

12:44.875 --> 12:47.250
It's just my mom
didn't come home last night.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.500
Did she go back
to her place?

12:49.583 --> 12:53.333
No, super would
have called me.

12:53.417 --> 12:55.208
I got some feelers out.

13:01.417 --> 13:03.667
- Amelia Flores?
- Yeah?

13:03.750 --> 13:04.959
Philly Homicide.

13:05.041 --> 13:07.000
Need to talk to you
about Jay Dratton.

13:08.542 --> 13:10.458
Why do I wanna talk
about that son of a
bitch?

13:10.542 --> 13:12.667
Well, there's some
confusion, Amelia.

13:12.750 --> 13:16.250
'Cause your daughter passed
away June 21, 1998.

13:16.333 --> 13:17.917
Think I don't know that?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.208
Yet, June 28th,
you're back at the hospital.

13:20.291 --> 13:21.458
'Same day that
son of a bitch'

13:21.542 --> 13:22.875
Jay died from a morphine OD.

13:22.959 --> 13:24.417
What gives?
You missing the food?

13:24.500 --> 13:25.625
If someone put that jerk

13:25.709 --> 13:27.041
out of his misery
it's news to me.

13:27.125 --> 13:28.792
Why were you at the
hospital, Amelia?

13:28.875 --> 13:31.458
I was back to talk
about my bill.

13:31.542 --> 13:33.917
I had no insurance,
owed 175 grand.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.333
Had to set up
a payment plan.

13:35.417 --> 13:37.083
And did you visit Jay
while you were there?

13:37.166 --> 13:38.709
Last person I wanted to see
was that guy.

13:38.792 --> 13:40.583
But if someone took him out,
I say he deserved it.

13:40.667 --> 13:42.875
Bad blood between
you two, huh?

13:42.959 --> 13:44.709
Seemed like that was his way
with everyone.

13:44.792 --> 13:47.583
You ever hear him talk
about someone named Louise?

13:49.375 --> 13:51.125
Yeah.

13:51.208 --> 13:53.458
The day he went home.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.750
So you're coming
home for good, Dad?

13:55.834 --> 13:57.000
Hopefully.

13:57.083 --> 13:58.417
I'm all done
with the chemo treatments.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.125
Now I wait for it
to kick in.

14:00.208 --> 14:03.709
'Cause I was gonna have
some friends over Saturday.

14:03.792 --> 14:06.083
Maybe some other
time, okay?

14:06.166 --> 14:07.375
Yeah.

14:09.667 --> 14:11.917
What is..

14:12.000 --> 14:13.792
Is that a tattoo?

14:13.875 --> 14:16.291
Yeah, I've had it
for like three months.

14:16.375 --> 14:17.583
You lose a bet?

14:17.667 --> 14:18.917
Funny, Dad.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.041
You look tired.
Get any sleep last night?

14:21.125 --> 14:22.542
Not really.

14:22.625 --> 14:24.083
You out
with your buddies?

14:24.166 --> 14:25.333
You know, you get
cancer and now

14:25.417 --> 14:26.625
you're all
interested in my
life?

14:26.709 --> 14:29.208
See if you can get
a little more lame,
dad.

14:29.291 --> 14:31.250
I've always been interested.

14:31.333 --> 14:32.834
Yeah? Okay.

14:34.583 --> 14:35.834
I drove into Kensington,

14:35.917 --> 14:38.750
scored some blow,
then I hit an after-hours
club.

14:38.834 --> 14:42.041
Mom thought I was
at the library.

14:42.125 --> 14:44.417
- Tell me you're kidding.
- It's the truth.

14:44.500 --> 14:45.625
Thought you liked that, dad.

14:45.709 --> 14:47.625
Tell it like it is.

14:47.709 --> 14:49.709
Fine, Tommy.

14:49.792 --> 14:50.959
I'm cutting you off.

14:51.041 --> 14:53.375
Allowance, trust.
Everything.

14:53.458 --> 14:55.542
Good luck buying coke
with no job.

14:57.041 --> 14:58.709
Whatever.

14:58.792 --> 15:00.959
And that Beamer you want
for graduation?

15:01.041 --> 15:03.041
Kiss it goodbye.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.792
I..

15:09.875 --> 15:11.959
There was a woman.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.500
Louise.

15:13.583 --> 15:15.125
Great. Louise?

15:15.208 --> 15:17.166
Does mom know
about her?

15:19.959 --> 15:23.375
Sounds like Jay was
having hallucinations.

15:23.458 --> 15:25.750
Dying people need to shake
things out from their past.

15:25.834 --> 15:27.792
They hang on
until they make peace with
it.

15:27.875 --> 15:29.250
Seems like
Tommy's another guy

15:29.333 --> 15:31.750
who wanted dad to keel over
sooner than later.

15:33.041 --> 15:35.875
It means the good
death,
you know.

15:35.959 --> 15:38.125
- What does?
- Euthanasia.

15:38.208 --> 15:40.041
It's Greek
for good
death.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.083
Yeah?

15:44.166 --> 15:46.500
A guy like that
Angel of Death
nurse?

15:47.500 --> 15:48.667
Larry Kenick.

15:48.750 --> 15:50.333
After seeing how my
daughter suffered

15:50.417 --> 15:52.458
they should give
him
a medal.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.166
Thanks. Bye.

16:02.250 --> 16:04.166
She turned up.

16:22.083 --> 16:24.834
There's the
Girl Scout of the
Year.

16:26.959 --> 16:29.792
Where'd you sleep
last night, mom?

16:31.500 --> 16:35.250
My mother always worked
so hard for us kids.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.166
I know.

16:40.375 --> 16:43.625
Eight hours
at the department store,
right?

16:43.709 --> 16:45.750
You're..

16:45.834 --> 16:47.709
You're proud of her.

16:47.792 --> 16:49.417
I was.

16:51.542 --> 16:54.709
Sorry you can't be proud
of me, Lilly.

16:59.834 --> 17:01.875
Mom, you gotta hang on.

17:01.959 --> 17:03.667
You can't fix
me
this time.

17:03.750 --> 17:06.083
Every day you get
a new chance to start over.

17:06.166 --> 17:07.792
I'm out of chances.

17:07.875 --> 17:09.583
No.

17:09.667 --> 17:11.166
It's not too late.

17:11.250 --> 17:13.291
It is, Lilly.

17:14.583 --> 17:16.166
It really is.

17:18.959 --> 17:20.166
It's the end.

17:28.291 --> 17:30.750
Hey.

17:30.834 --> 17:33.667
Then I want you
to stay with me.

17:33.750 --> 17:36.000
No matter what.

17:37.667 --> 17:39.000
Keep it comin'.

17:39.875 --> 17:41.333
Hey.

17:43.166 --> 17:45.959
You'll stay with me, right?

17:47.542 --> 17:49.542
Yeah, I will.

18:07.875 --> 18:09.792
Tommy Dratton?

18:09.875 --> 18:10.917
Tom.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Detectives Miller
and Jeffries.

18:13.083 --> 18:14.458
It's about your father.

18:14.542 --> 18:15.834
What about him?

18:15.917 --> 18:18.083
It turns out someone killed
him
before the cancer did.

18:18.166 --> 18:20.500
- 'Shot him full of
morphine.'
- No kidding.

18:20.583 --> 18:23.041
You didn't get along
with him, did you?

18:23.125 --> 18:24.542
Not particularly.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.041
In fact, two days
after his death

18:26.125 --> 18:28.458
you bought a $50,000 car.

18:28.542 --> 18:29.667
Guilty.

18:29.750 --> 18:31.500
Kinda like those
Beverly Hills brothers

18:31.583 --> 18:33.625
took their dad out
to get his money.

18:33.709 --> 18:37.333
(Will)
'Except they hadn't
been cut out by him.'

18:37.417 --> 18:38.709
Not like you were, Tom.

18:38.792 --> 18:42.667
Look, I was at home with my mom
on the night he died.

18:42.750 --> 18:43.917
Hmm.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.500
And I didn't have to kill him.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.375
He was already dead
in my mind.

18:47.458 --> 18:50.041
So, what happened
to the fancy wheels?

18:50.125 --> 18:51.875
After I spent a few
years
getting wasted

18:51.959 --> 18:53.583
and being
pissed
at the world

18:53.667 --> 18:55.709
I finally saw
what I was
doing.

18:55.792 --> 18:57.959
Repeating history.

18:58.041 --> 19:00.500
One night I looked
into my rearview mirror

19:00.583 --> 19:03.125
and saw my dad staring back.

19:03.208 --> 19:05.208
And changed your ways?

19:05.291 --> 19:06.667
Lost the tat.

19:06.750 --> 19:08.000
Yeah.

19:08.083 --> 19:09.375
Look, I have a kid now.

19:09.458 --> 19:10.917
I didn't want to be
that kind of father.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.959
What do you know
about this woman Louise?

19:14.041 --> 19:17.041
No idea who she was.
Neither did he.

19:17.125 --> 19:20.166
The tumor was doing
crazy things to his
mind.

19:21.583 --> 19:23.959
(Phil)
'Hello?'

19:24.041 --> 19:26.125
'Hello?'

19:26.208 --> 19:29.083
Jay, you ready?

19:29.166 --> 19:30.125
'Morning, sunshine.'

19:30.208 --> 19:33.834
Dude, dig the cane, huh?

19:33.917 --> 19:35.709
I'm loving this thing.

19:35.792 --> 19:39.583
When the cancer's gone,
I'm gonna keep using it.

19:39.667 --> 19:41.041
My new trademark.

19:41.125 --> 19:42.917
What's the latest?

19:43.000 --> 19:44.500
(Jay)
'So far, so good.'

19:44.583 --> 19:46.834
Out of the hospital
a week now.

19:48.041 --> 19:49.500
Feeling better.

19:49.583 --> 19:51.041
Maybe you should
take the day off.

19:51.125 --> 19:53.750
The day you slow down
is the day they beat you.

19:53.834 --> 19:55.542
But you already won, man.

19:55.625 --> 19:57.583
That's what my father said..

19:57.667 --> 20:00.083
...before he was laid off.

20:05.166 --> 20:07.166
Why do you..

20:07.250 --> 20:10.208
Why do you have a motel key?

20:13.166 --> 20:14.250
What are you talking about?

20:14.333 --> 20:16.542
I saw the motel key.

20:19.083 --> 20:20.917
She kept it?

20:21.000 --> 20:23.250
She?

20:23.333 --> 20:25.667
What are you saying?

20:25.750 --> 20:26.917
Nothing.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.834
It's
Caroline.
Isn't it?

20:31.875 --> 20:34.625
- Like you care.
- You son of a bitch.

20:34.709 --> 20:36.458
What kind of companies
do we like to buy?

20:36.542 --> 20:38.417
Undervalued,
underappreciated.

20:38.500 --> 20:39.667
That sound like a woman
we know?

20:39.750 --> 20:41.458
- She's my wife.
- It's your fault!

20:41.542 --> 20:42.875
And you're
my best friend.

20:42.959 --> 20:45.208
You stopped caring
about her years ago.

20:45.291 --> 20:46.750
Get out!

20:48.875 --> 20:51.166
Oh, yeah, since
I'm the general partner

20:51.250 --> 20:52.625
'I'm buying you out.'

20:52.709 --> 20:55.583
Say hi to Harv
on the unemployment line.

21:05.250 --> 21:06.667
Did your dad
buy him out?

21:06.750 --> 21:08.166
He was in the works.

21:08.250 --> 21:10.166
Papers were supposed
to be signed in July.

21:10.250 --> 21:12.333
But Jay died first.

21:12.417 --> 21:14.834
Look, I really gotta go
pick up my son.

21:14.917 --> 21:16.291
Okay.

21:16.375 --> 21:17.375
Thanks, Tom.

21:17.458 --> 21:19.208
Phil plays
his cards
right

21:19.291 --> 21:20.792
he gets the money
and the girl.

21:20.875 --> 21:22.500
And Caroline gets
a new husband.

21:22.583 --> 21:24.000
One who appreciates her.

21:24.083 --> 21:27.500
But the clock's
ticking
on Phil to lose
millions.

21:27.583 --> 21:29.417
Suddenly,
killing a dying man

21:29.500 --> 21:32.166
makes a hell
of a lot of sense.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.625
(Nick)
'So, Phil..'

21:42.709 --> 21:45.125
...you're giving it
to Jay's wife on the sly

21:45.208 --> 21:49.417
he finds out, retaliates by
cutting you out of your
company.

21:49.500 --> 21:52.709
The company I now run?
That one?

21:52.792 --> 21:54.625
You run it because
you killed him for it.

21:54.709 --> 21:56.375
Hey, Sherlock.

21:56.458 --> 21:57.917
Jay was days away
from croaking.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.417
But first, he was
gonna fire you.

21:59.500 --> 22:00.625
'And a guy like you'

22:00.709 --> 22:03.375
has no problem
killing a dying man.

22:03.458 --> 22:06.875
You don't know jack
about guys like me.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.208
(Lilly)
'Lot of money at stake'

22:08.291 --> 22:10.875
for you and your
new boyfriend, Caroline.

22:10.959 --> 22:12.291
Boyfriend?

22:12.375 --> 22:14.750
Phil. Your husband's partner.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.125
Risky move.

22:16.208 --> 22:18.000
That was one night of revenge.

22:18.083 --> 22:20.417
I was trying to get
Jay's attention.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.250
- Did you?
- 'Yeah.'

22:22.333 --> 22:24.375
He threatened to divorce me.

22:24.458 --> 22:27.583
But by then, his heart
wasn't in it anymore.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.542
(Caroline)
'Jay.'

22:37.625 --> 22:40.667
I've been looking
all over for you.

22:40.750 --> 22:43.000
You see the doctor?

22:43.083 --> 22:45.083
Said the tumor's not
responding to
treatment.

22:45.166 --> 22:47.583
Apparently, the cancer's
not interested

22:47.667 --> 22:49.750
in my winning attitude.

22:49.834 --> 22:51.792
Are you gonna do
more chemo?

22:51.875 --> 22:55.000
No. It's pointless.

22:55.083 --> 22:59.208
I can barely,
remember those days.

23:01.458 --> 23:02.750
What days?

23:02.834 --> 23:04.542
When Tommy was a baby.

23:04.625 --> 23:08.583
Our one-bedroom apartment
in Fishtown.

23:13.375 --> 23:15.041
Jay...about Phil

23:15.125 --> 23:17.333
'it was one time
and it was pathetic.'

23:17.417 --> 23:19.250
- I'm sorry.
- 'Don't be.'

23:20.625 --> 23:24.500
We don't need to pretend
that we have something.

23:24.583 --> 23:27.000
Maybe we never did.

23:30.041 --> 23:32.458
And you...don't have to play

23:32.542 --> 23:35.709
the role of faithful wife
anymore.

23:35.792 --> 23:37.000
'I mean it.'

23:37.083 --> 23:38.625
- I can die alone.
- Jay..

23:38.709 --> 23:41.667
I have no right
to put you through this.

23:43.291 --> 23:45.041
Are they giving you
enough medication for your
pain?

23:45.125 --> 23:47.500
I'm alright.

23:47.583 --> 23:50.000
It comes and goes,
I mean, I..

23:50.083 --> 23:53.500
...keep having
these weird flashes.

23:53.583 --> 23:55.458
- With the headaches?
- 'Yeah.'

23:55.542 --> 23:58.542
I'm on a beach,
the wind's blowing.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.583
Sounds peaceful.

24:01.667 --> 24:03.875
No, it's not.

24:05.583 --> 24:09.208
I think I did
something terrible.

24:16.333 --> 24:19.417
First time I'd ever seen
Jay give up.

24:19.500 --> 24:22.208
He tell you this
terrible thing he
did?

24:22.291 --> 24:24.834
No. And I didn't even ask.

24:24.917 --> 24:26.709
We were long past
sharing secrets.

24:26.792 --> 24:28.709
Was that your last
conversation with him?

24:28.792 --> 24:31.542
Yeah. Two days later,
he was gone.

24:31.625 --> 24:34.667
He'd given up on winning
and I'd given up on him.

24:35.834 --> 24:37.625
(Phil)
'We had it out over
Caroline.'

24:37.709 --> 24:41.333
He made his threat.
That was that.

24:41.417 --> 24:43.375
You weren't worried
he would follow through?

24:43.458 --> 24:46.500
He didn't have the energy
to buy me out.

24:46.583 --> 24:50.875
The last thing he did was take
a 175 grand from his slush
fund.

24:50.959 --> 24:52.542
He say why?

24:52.625 --> 24:55.458
Just that it was for a woman.

24:55.542 --> 24:58.458
Maybe cancer boy
was the one cheating.

24:58.542 --> 25:00.375
Was her name Louise?

25:02.041 --> 25:03.917
No.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.458
I don't think so.

25:06.542 --> 25:08.500
How about Amelia?

25:09.875 --> 25:12.291
That's it.

25:16.500 --> 25:19.709
(Will)
'Jay Dratton was suffering,
just like your daughter
did.'

25:19.792 --> 25:21.959
And didn't you say
guys like Larry Kenick

25:22.041 --> 25:23.250
should get a medal?

25:23.333 --> 25:24.625
Doesn't mean
I did what he
did.

25:24.709 --> 25:26.959
Well, you had access
to morphine.

25:27.041 --> 25:28.542
'You knew how
to administer it.'

25:28.625 --> 25:30.250
And Jay had the 175 grand

25:30.333 --> 25:32.125
you needed to pay
your hospital bills.

25:32.208 --> 25:34.417
You make a deal, Amelia?

25:34.500 --> 25:36.166
'To help him die?'

25:36.250 --> 25:39.709
I told you. I didn't
see him that day.

25:39.792 --> 25:42.208
But you did see him again?

25:42.291 --> 25:45.166
I couldn't help my daughter

25:45.250 --> 25:47.083
but I could help him.

25:48.333 --> 25:50.875
I had six vials
of morphine left
over.

25:52.333 --> 25:53.917
That's enough to kill a man.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.709
I said I wouldn't do it.

25:55.792 --> 25:57.709
But you gave him the vials.

25:57.792 --> 25:59.417
(Amelia)
'Yeah, the day he died.'

25:59.500 --> 26:00.709
I couldn't tell you before.

26:00.792 --> 26:02.542
- I knew how it would look.
- 'Yeah.'

26:02.625 --> 26:04.125
Like crap.

26:04.208 --> 26:06.542
Even that jerk didn't deserve
such pain.

26:06.625 --> 26:08.709
And when was this, Amelia?

26:08.792 --> 26:10.834
When he came to see me.

26:20.834 --> 26:22.417
You.

26:22.500 --> 26:24.375
I heard about your daughter.

26:28.583 --> 26:30.959
I'm sorry.

26:31.041 --> 26:34.792
And I'm ashamed..

26:34.875 --> 26:36.417
'...at my behavior.'

26:36.500 --> 26:39.500
I want to help cover
any expenses you might have.

26:42.792 --> 26:44.417
No, thanks.

26:45.583 --> 26:48.834
I'm going to leave
this check here.

26:48.917 --> 26:51.917
I've been very fortunate
in my life.

26:53.583 --> 26:55.834
Please..

26:55.917 --> 26:58.625
...let me share it
with you.

27:00.500 --> 27:02.458
What's that?

27:02.542 --> 27:04.458
Open it.

27:07.667 --> 27:10.583
I saw your daughter
in the hallway one night.

27:10.667 --> 27:12.417
Keeping you awake again?

27:12.500 --> 27:14.375
No.

27:14.458 --> 27:16.750
We both couldn't sleep.

27:16.834 --> 27:21.959
She told me she saw
butterflies in her room.

27:22.041 --> 27:24.208
Hallucinations.

27:24.291 --> 27:26.375
And I told her
about mine.

27:26.458 --> 27:28.667
Just talking to her

27:28.750 --> 27:31.959
she somehow put me at ease.

27:34.291 --> 27:35.792
I didn't deserve it.

27:40.625 --> 27:42.250
Thank you.

27:46.125 --> 27:48.333
You want to sit down?

27:58.458 --> 28:00.583
What was it like
for her?

28:00.667 --> 28:01.709
Was she lucid?

28:01.792 --> 28:04.625
Was she...in pain?

28:04.709 --> 28:09.000
She was peaceful near the end,
just looking at the
butterflies.

28:09.083 --> 28:10.500
Good.

28:10.583 --> 28:13.667
I think they were angels
waiting
to take her to the other side.

28:13.750 --> 28:15.166
To heaven.

28:15.250 --> 28:17.417
I might be headed
to a different neighborhood.

28:19.500 --> 28:23.083
Hell is only for people
who've forgotten how to love.

28:23.166 --> 28:25.166
'You can't love anymore?'

28:25.250 --> 28:26.542
I don't know.

28:26.625 --> 28:28.500
'I don't know anything anymore.'

28:28.583 --> 28:30.291
I keep seeing things.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.333
- The beach?
- 'Yes.'

28:32.417 --> 28:35.959
And a...a woman named Louise.

28:37.166 --> 28:39.041
What are you doing there?

28:40.375 --> 28:43.458
I was...at a motel.

28:43.542 --> 28:45.041
I..

28:47.166 --> 28:48.667
(Tommy)
'Dad!'

28:48.750 --> 28:51.917
[coughing]
Tommy was there.
He saw everything.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.208
Should I call
an ambulance?

28:53.291 --> 28:55.959
No. No, I'm better.

28:56.041 --> 28:57.959
I'll call someone.

29:00.375 --> 29:02.792
(Will)
'What did Tommy
see on the beach?'

29:02.875 --> 29:04.709
I don't know.

29:04.792 --> 29:07.750
But who did Jay call
to pick him up?

29:10.208 --> 29:11.458
His son.

29:12.625 --> 29:14.875
He took him back to Jackson.

29:14.959 --> 29:17.709
So Tommy was on hand
in his dad's final hours.

29:17.792 --> 29:20.709
Along with six vials
of morphine.

29:32.208 --> 29:35.250
Yeah, okay, I drove my dad
to the hospital.

29:35.333 --> 29:37.375
Different story
than you gave
before.

29:37.458 --> 29:39.125
It was years ago.
I forgot.

29:39.208 --> 29:43.250
Oh. You forget he had six
vials
of morphine with him, too?

29:43.333 --> 29:45.500
I don't know anything
about that.

29:45.583 --> 29:47.208
Something's hinky here, Tom.

29:47.291 --> 29:51.333
You didn't forget taking your
dad back to the place he died.

29:51.417 --> 29:53.583
You left that
out
on purpose.

29:53.667 --> 29:54.959
Why?

29:55.041 --> 29:56.250
If I told you

29:56.333 --> 29:59.125
I'd have to remember
how I was with him.

30:00.166 --> 30:02.709
How you were when?

30:02.792 --> 30:04.917
The last time
we were together.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.500
Like always,
I was blind with hate.

30:08.583 --> 30:11.667
That's just being a teenage kid.

30:13.875 --> 30:17.083
The man was dying
in front of my eyes

30:17.166 --> 30:19.583
and I was hard as nails.

30:27.750 --> 30:29.667
(Tommy)
'Can I go now?'

30:32.542 --> 30:34.542
(Jay)
'I haven't..'

30:34.625 --> 30:36.959
...I haven't been much
of a father, have I?

30:39.041 --> 30:41.250
I'm sorry I haven't been around.

30:42.458 --> 30:43.875
Yeah, right.

30:45.208 --> 30:46.750
I know..

30:47.834 --> 30:49.709
...you're always pissed off.

30:49.792 --> 30:52.667
'And I know where
you get it'

30:52.750 --> 30:55.583
but you got to let it go.

30:56.917 --> 30:58.875
It's poison.

31:04.125 --> 31:07.750
Isn't the water beautiful,
Tommy?

31:11.542 --> 31:15.125
'Take my hand, Tommy.'

32:09.375 --> 32:10.792
Dad!

32:14.041 --> 32:15.458
Where'd you go, daddy?

32:15.542 --> 32:16.875
I had a work
phone call.

32:16.959 --> 32:18.500
- You know what I told them?
- What?

32:18.583 --> 32:21.750
I said I'm staying the
week
out here with my family.

32:21.834 --> 32:23.041
Work can wait.

32:23.125 --> 32:24.709
Yeah!

32:30.583 --> 32:32.083
Isn't the water beautiful,
Tommy?

32:32.166 --> 32:33.709
Yeah.

32:48.792 --> 32:51.500
It wasn't a nightmare.

32:51.583 --> 32:54.917
Remember the week
I took off work?

32:55.000 --> 32:57.166
We stayed at the shore

32:57.250 --> 32:59.959
in that crappy motel?

33:01.333 --> 33:02.834
I don't know.

33:02.917 --> 33:05.500
Sure you do.

33:05.583 --> 33:08.375
'We were a real
family once, Tommy.'

33:09.125 --> 33:11.542
Promise me you remember.

33:13.041 --> 33:14.917
'Do you?'

33:16.041 --> 33:18.041
I don't remember a thing.

33:23.709 --> 33:25.917
I know you do.

33:27.333 --> 33:29.750
I know you remember.

33:35.917 --> 33:37.875
I should have told him
I remembered.

33:37.959 --> 33:39.959
'Cause you did.

33:40.041 --> 33:43.250
So your dad was
reaching out in the
end.

33:43.333 --> 33:46.458
- You tell your mom that?
- Yeah.

33:46.542 --> 33:49.417
[laughing]
And she was so happy.

33:52.208 --> 33:54.250
I mean, she still hated the
guy
and everything.

33:54.333 --> 33:55.834
Which is it, Tom?

33:55.917 --> 33:57.625
'Happy or not?'

33:58.542 --> 34:00.917
'If your mom
was happy'

34:01.000 --> 34:02.667
'maybe she went back to
make peace with him.'

34:02.750 --> 34:04.291
- No way.
- That's what I'd do.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.625
She didn't. I told you
I was with her that night.

34:06.709 --> 34:09.250
Doesn't make it so.

34:09.333 --> 34:11.291
She went to him.

34:11.375 --> 34:13.125
Didn't she?

34:18.083 --> 34:20.041
Jay sounds like he was
a real piece of work.

34:21.458 --> 34:23.291
- He was.
- Hmm.

34:23.375 --> 34:25.625
Well, some people
are like that.

34:25.709 --> 34:27.709
Impossible.

34:27.792 --> 34:31.125
You try to stop caring,
you try to write 'em off,
but..

34:31.208 --> 34:33.208
...it's always there.

34:33.291 --> 34:36.667
That attachment,
that... love.

34:36.750 --> 34:38.458
Not for me and Jay.

34:38.542 --> 34:39.583
No?

34:39.667 --> 34:40.709
No, I didn't love him
by the end.

34:40.792 --> 34:42.417
- Hmm.
- I told you that.

34:42.500 --> 34:43.959
Not even when you heard
he'd been talking

34:44.041 --> 34:46.375
about that week
at the shore?

34:46.458 --> 34:47.500
The shore?

34:47.583 --> 34:49.500
Yeah, the three of you.

34:49.583 --> 34:51.750
'At Motel Louise.'

34:51.834 --> 34:53.291
He was probably
just hallucinating.

34:53.375 --> 34:54.458
No, it was real.

34:54.542 --> 34:56.500
And it's just
that kind of memory

34:56.583 --> 34:58.333
'that won't leave you
alone.'

34:58.417 --> 35:00.542
Makes you keep loving.

35:01.834 --> 35:03.875
So maybe I did still care.
What's it matter?

35:03.959 --> 35:06.834
I think when you heard
Jay was talking about that
week

35:06.917 --> 35:09.333
you remembered, too.

35:09.417 --> 35:12.208
Remembered those days
when he was a better man.

35:12.291 --> 35:15.333
You heard that
and you couldn't stay away.

35:15.417 --> 35:16.709
Of course
you went to him.

35:16.792 --> 35:18.333
You don't know
what I was going
through.

35:18.417 --> 35:20.417
I do, actually.

35:21.417 --> 35:23.667
There's someone I...love.

35:23.750 --> 35:26.166
Someone I wish
I didn't, but..

35:26.250 --> 35:28.083
...I can't stop.

35:29.208 --> 35:30.750
And..

35:33.000 --> 35:35.417
...she's dying.

35:37.500 --> 35:40.542
'I fought and I scrapped
with her for years.'

35:40.625 --> 35:43.000
'Just when I think
I'm done with her'

35:43.083 --> 35:45.333
I remember things.

35:45.417 --> 35:47.709
Like...when I was little

35:47.792 --> 35:49.000
'I'd get these nightmares'

35:49.083 --> 35:52.250
and she'd read
"The Velveteen Rabbit" to me.

35:53.709 --> 35:56.583
[sighs]
I felt so safe.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.417
It matters
where the heart begins.

36:04.500 --> 36:06.333
You know?

36:08.291 --> 36:09.917
I know.

36:12.041 --> 36:14.333
And when it's the end

36:14.417 --> 36:17.417
maybe the most we can do
for that person is..

36:18.917 --> 36:21.417
...help them along.

36:23.667 --> 36:25.959
To get peace.

36:27.208 --> 36:28.583
A peaceful death.

36:28.667 --> 36:30.750
A good death.

36:34.208 --> 36:37.500
I understand
if you helped Jay die.

36:39.250 --> 36:41.250
But is that ever
the right thing?

36:41.333 --> 36:43.709
To help someone who's in pain?

36:43.792 --> 36:45.333
'Who you love?'

36:45.417 --> 36:47.917
I don't know how
that can be wrong.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.750
Do you?

36:57.375 --> 36:59.458
You don't have to be here.

37:00.291 --> 37:01.959
I want to.

37:03.583 --> 37:05.458
Got some new ones.

37:06.250 --> 37:07.792
For my list.

37:07.875 --> 37:10.875
Oh...the overrated list.

37:12.041 --> 37:13.375
'No.'

37:14.041 --> 37:16.458
Underrated list.

37:16.542 --> 37:17.667
Underrated?

37:17.750 --> 37:23.875
Yeah, there's ice water
and the TV remote.

37:25.750 --> 37:27.542
Those things are magic.

37:28.875 --> 37:30.291
'And the sound..'

37:30.375 --> 37:32.166
'...the sound
of you laughing.'

37:32.250 --> 37:35.125
Very underrated.

37:36.333 --> 37:38.083
I miss it.

37:41.166 --> 37:42.417
Uh..

37:44.667 --> 37:47.333
Tommy told me
about the beach.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
[chuckles]
Louise.

37:54.083 --> 37:55.667
Yes.

37:55.750 --> 37:58.417
I remember, too.

37:59.625 --> 38:02.166
You do?

38:02.250 --> 38:06.208
Yeah, I think somehow
along the way, we both forgot.

38:07.250 --> 38:09.000
Promise me..

38:09.083 --> 38:13.500
Promise me you'll remember
the guy in this picture.

38:15.792 --> 38:17.041
I promise.

38:18.625 --> 38:20.875
'And no matter how
much time there is..'

38:20.959 --> 38:22.625
...I'm here now.

38:22.709 --> 38:25.750
I've run out of ways
to not..

38:28.166 --> 38:31.333
...think about the pain.

38:40.250 --> 38:41.542
(Caroline)
'Oh..'

38:41.625 --> 38:45.458
- Jay, no--
- I have no right to ask
you.

38:49.458 --> 38:51.875
You're sure?

38:51.959 --> 38:54.250
It's non-negotiable.

38:59.083 --> 39:01.125
I love you, you know.

39:03.291 --> 39:05.333
I love you.

39:15.166 --> 39:16.792
Hey..

39:18.709 --> 39:22.166
...you know what I remember
most about that motel?

39:22.250 --> 39:24.625
I remember us laying..

39:24.709 --> 39:28.041
...in bed together
at night...and I could..

39:29.667 --> 39:32.917
...hear the ocean waves.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.583
Feel a cool breeze
move over us.

39:42.417 --> 39:47.000
And I felt
you
next to me.

39:51.041 --> 39:53.625
[sniffles]
We were both so in debt.

39:55.333 --> 39:56.959
'Struggling with our jobs'

39:57.041 --> 40:01.083
and...all I could think was..

40:04.041 --> 40:06.125
Babe, we'd..

40:10.125 --> 40:12.166
...we'd already made it.
