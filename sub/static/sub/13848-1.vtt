02:41.127 --> 02:44.324
Man, this lake is really starting
to freak me out.

02:44.887 --> 02:46.764
You know how many people
have disappeared from here

02:46.847 --> 02:48.997
in the last couple of years?

02:49.207 --> 02:50.276
Maybe two.

02:50.367 --> 02:54.201
But do you know how many people have
disappeared just in the last six months?

02:54.287 --> 02:55.606
Five.

02:55.687 --> 02:58.724
Man, you are paranoid.
You should really lay off the green.

02:58.807 --> 03:00.559
At least share some with me.

03:00.647 --> 03:03.844
All right, I'm done.
Let's get the hell out of here.

03:03.927 --> 03:06.805
Slow down.
Let me finish getting my samples.

03:08.727 --> 03:11.161
You gotta relax. You need a hobby.

03:11.487 --> 03:13.239
You should try golf.

03:13.447 --> 03:15.324
Tillman, why are you even here?

03:15.407 --> 03:17.125
You're more concerned
with baseball and mullets

03:17.207 --> 03:18.481
than you are with the ecosystem.

03:18.567 --> 03:21.479
For your information,
I got into this line of work

03:21.567 --> 03:25.685
so I could meet sexy eco-warrior chicks
who don't shave their legs.

03:37.447 --> 03:40.519
Oh, God, help me!

03:42.327 --> 03:44.841
Help me! Help me! No!

03:49.327 --> 03:52.717
Tillman! Tillman! Tillman!

03:53.967 --> 03:57.118
Tillman! Tillman!

04:04.687 --> 04:06.598
Good morning, sunshine.

04:07.087 --> 04:09.726
-So, are we having fun yet?
-Yeah, tons.

04:09.807 --> 04:12.321
Are you kidding me?
This is the boredom capital of the universe.

04:12.407 --> 04:14.841
Look, Scott, you're stuck with me
for a month,

04:14.927 --> 04:17.600
so why don't you at least try
and have a good time, huh?

04:17.687 --> 04:19.517
You don't even have cable
or high speed lnternet.

04:19.607 --> 04:21.279
My cell phone doesn't even work out here.

04:21.367 --> 04:24.006
Well, a lot of people would think
that was a good thing, Scott.

04:24.087 --> 04:26.282
Yeah, unlike your nasty meatloaf pie.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.483
Since you're so determined
to be miserable out here,

04:28.567 --> 04:30.683
why did you decide to come along
in the first place?

04:30.767 --> 04:33.645
It's called a custody agreement, Sheriff.

04:34.087 --> 04:36.965
Listen, I want to get something straight
with you right off the bat, son.

04:37.047 --> 04:38.685
You might be able to talk
to your little friends that way,

04:38.767 --> 04:40.598
but I'm not one of your little friends
and I'm not your peer.

04:40.687 --> 04:43.281
I'm your father, so I demand respect.

04:44.567 --> 04:45.841
Whatever.

04:47.527 --> 04:49.006
Sheriff Riley, come in.

04:49.087 --> 04:50.759
Go for Riley.

04:50.847 --> 04:53.236
Sheriff, that EPA guy is here again.

04:53.327 --> 04:56.524
Says his partner's gone missing on the lake.
Over.

04:56.647 --> 05:00.322
Mills? He probably smoked a bad bowl
and forgot he was all by himself.

05:00.407 --> 05:02.159
I'll be there in a few minutes.

05:02.247 --> 05:03.282
Look, I gotta go in to work.

05:03.367 --> 05:06.518
But afterwards I'll stop by, grab you,
we'll go in to town and catch a movie, huh?

05:06.607 --> 05:08.086
Yeah, maybe.

05:21.407 --> 05:23.443
So, why don't you talk to her already?

05:23.527 --> 05:25.483
Jesus, Dad.
Don't you gotta go to work or something?

05:25.567 --> 05:26.602
Yes.

05:26.687 --> 05:28.086
So, why don't you talk to her already?

05:28.167 --> 05:30.283
I'll talk to her when I want to talk to her.

05:30.367 --> 05:34.076
If you're so excited about it,
why don't you go talk to her?

05:35.007 --> 05:37.237
Be careful what you wish for.

05:47.407 --> 05:50.001
Hey! Can I speak to you for a minute?

05:53.287 --> 05:54.879
Hi, how are you?

06:06.847 --> 06:08.997
Oh, this is not happening.

06:32.407 --> 06:34.875
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Sheriff.

06:34.967 --> 06:37.003
Miner, are you crazy,
sneaking up on somebody like that?

06:37.087 --> 06:38.202
Hey, that's my job.

06:38.287 --> 06:39.800
Yeah, well, excuse me
while I go do my mine.

06:39.887 --> 06:42.242
You know, I heard someone else
has gone missing on the lake.

06:42.327 --> 06:43.806
How many does that make now, Sheriff?

06:43.887 --> 06:46.526
Is there a possible serial killer
on the loose, wild animal?

06:46.607 --> 06:49.041
Maybe an Al-Qaeda jihad?
Care to comment?

06:49.127 --> 06:50.355
Yeah, I care to comment.

06:50.447 --> 06:53.484
You write anything in that newspaper
of yours that sends my town into a panic,

06:53.567 --> 06:56.843
I'll be looking for you
at the bottom of that lake.

06:57.247 --> 06:59.238
You can quote me on that.

07:00.047 --> 07:02.242
You're a guard dog. Guard!

07:02.327 --> 07:04.079
Who buys your bones?

07:04.527 --> 07:06.006
Can somebody please explain to me

07:06.087 --> 07:08.362
why the local gossip
has to be breathing down my neck?

07:08.447 --> 07:09.562
Hello, Frank.

07:09.647 --> 07:12.605
There's enough going on around here
without having to deal with that moron.

07:12.687 --> 07:15.804
I told that dirty, rotten snoop, Cal Miner,
to get the heck out of here.

07:15.887 --> 07:19.118
He just started yammering on about
freedom of the press, or some such.

07:19.207 --> 07:20.686
Why don't you just shoot him, Sheriff?

07:20.767 --> 07:22.246
If it were only that easy.

07:22.327 --> 07:24.682
There you go,
making things too complicated again.

07:24.767 --> 07:26.883
Can we make an exception in Cal's case?

07:26.967 --> 07:29.481
Dale, do not tempt me.

07:29.567 --> 07:30.602
Sheriff, listen...

07:30.687 --> 07:33.076
-Hey, Frank, how's it going?
-Good.

07:33.167 --> 07:35.362
No, no, not that great, you know.

07:35.447 --> 07:38.439
Yeah, I heard about that.
Why don't you fill us all in?

07:38.527 --> 07:42.759
Okay, well, my partner and l
are working on the lake and,

07:43.087 --> 07:45.885
well, the next thing I know he's in the water.

07:45.967 --> 07:47.798
-Just like that?
-Yeah.

07:48.327 --> 07:51.399
Well, I'm trying to get him back in the boat
and he's screaming and yelling,

07:51.487 --> 07:52.806
and something pulls him under.

07:52.887 --> 07:54.206
He's gone, Sheriff.

07:54.287 --> 07:56.198
I'm a little unclear on something here.

07:56.287 --> 07:59.438
How exactly did he wind up
in the water in the first place?

07:59.527 --> 08:02.519
Pretty sure he fell off leaning over the side.

08:05.127 --> 08:07.004
Frank, I've got a question for you.

08:07.087 --> 08:11.763
Did you, by any chance,
eat any organic brownies this morning?

08:14.207 --> 08:16.357
You think this is just a joke, Sheriff?

08:16.447 --> 08:19.439
Come with me
and I'll show you the punch line.

08:20.047 --> 08:21.446
Okay, Frank.

08:29.767 --> 08:33.965
I've got a feeling I'm not gonna like
what's under that sheet.

08:40.447 --> 08:41.515
Wow.

08:44.246 --> 08:46.522
So these are your friend, huh?

08:46.647 --> 08:48.000
Used to be.

08:48.767 --> 08:51.725
Whatever's in your lake took the rest of him.

08:51.847 --> 08:54.600
I've got to call Fish and Wildlife right away.
Cover that up, Charlie.

08:54.687 --> 08:56.723
We've already been called.

09:00.287 --> 09:03.120
Well, gentlemen, isn't this just ducky?

09:04.047 --> 09:07.084
Look, James, if it's any consolation,
I asked them to send someone else.

09:07.167 --> 09:09.397
Oh, I appreciate your concern, Emma,
but I'm a professional.

09:09.487 --> 09:12.320
I can handle it. It's just that I hadn't
heard from you in so damn long.

09:12.407 --> 09:13.920
I sent you an e-mail.

09:14.007 --> 09:16.965
You sent me a group e-mail about
some PETA rally. How personal was that?

09:17.047 --> 09:20.676
Honestly, I didn't think you were
quite over your ex-wife.

09:23.047 --> 09:24.878
Well, now, just what the hell
is that supposed to mean?

09:24.967 --> 09:26.764
I hate to break up couples' therapy,

09:26.847 --> 09:29.839
but I'm not Dr Phil
and this sure as hell ain't Oprah.

09:29.927 --> 09:31.883
That's not a toy, Frank!

09:35.967 --> 09:39.198
Emma? Look what you did.

09:39.807 --> 09:41.365
Are you happy?

09:42.007 --> 09:46.523
I'm so embarrassed.
I always had a weak stomach for blood.

09:47.287 --> 09:50.245
It's a good thing you weren't
out on the lake. Boy, it was awful.

09:50.327 --> 09:53.046
-Pulled him under so quickly, so strong.
-Here.

09:53.767 --> 09:54.802
Something that vicious, Frank,

09:54.887 --> 09:57.196
it had to be a mountain lion,
a sick bear, something like that.

09:57.287 --> 09:59.403
The chances of a mammal
killing someone on a lake that deep

09:59.487 --> 10:00.602
are about a billion to one.

10:00.687 --> 10:03.440
About as good as our chances
of finding out on this porch.

10:03.527 --> 10:05.961
Think you can handle
going back to the lake, Frank?

10:06.047 --> 10:07.639
Yeah, sure. Let's do it.

10:07.727 --> 10:08.955
Okay.

10:09.167 --> 10:11.556
I have a boat. Let's go.

10:17.327 --> 10:19.636
Frank, we've been over
the same area four times.

10:19.727 --> 10:21.877
You sure this is where Tillman went under?

10:21.967 --> 10:23.320
I think so.

10:23.687 --> 10:24.961
Think so?

10:25.487 --> 10:28.843
I didn't know anyone lived
on this side of the lake.

10:31.407 --> 10:33.557
It's crazy Sadie Bickerman.

10:34.047 --> 10:38.359
She moved into that place
a couple years after her sister went missing.

10:38.687 --> 10:43.807
The way I hear it, she used to feed live cattle
to a couple of 40-foot prehistoric crocs

10:43.887 --> 10:45.718
she kept in her backyard.

10:45.807 --> 10:47.684
What? That's ridiculous.

10:47.767 --> 10:51.316
That's the kind of detail you could have
shared with us back at the morgue.

10:51.407 --> 10:52.920
Mills, come on.

10:53.167 --> 10:56.284
You know everybody around here
is prone to exaggeration, if you get my drift.

10:56.367 --> 10:58.437
And crocodiles don't live
as far north as Maine, Frank.

10:58.527 --> 11:01.644
If there really was one up here, I'm sure
it would've been a newsworthy occurrence.

11:01.727 --> 11:04.287
Maybe, but that's not the kind of thing
a lake town would want

11:04.367 --> 11:06.483
featured on its tourism brochure.

11:06.567 --> 11:08.159
Hey, slow down.

11:08.727 --> 11:10.718
Over there, what is that?

11:10.927 --> 11:12.360
I don't know.

11:14.807 --> 11:17.640
I'm pulling in, see if I can't fish it out.

11:24.727 --> 11:27.685
Yeah, let's see here. Come here.

11:31.287 --> 11:33.357
Just a second, we'll get there.

11:33.447 --> 11:34.926
Whoa, what are you doing?

11:35.007 --> 11:36.759
It's not like you haven't seen all this before.

11:36.847 --> 11:40.362
Well, we can wait around here all day
or I can jump in and see what it is.

11:40.447 --> 11:42.563
Turn around. Turn around!

11:43.327 --> 11:45.522
So, you're just gonna jump in?
You're not even gonna let...

11:45.607 --> 11:48.519
-Yeah, I'm going in.
-You never change. Turn around!

11:49.247 --> 11:51.124
What do you think?
A 40-foot croc's gonna get me?

11:51.207 --> 11:52.959
There's always hope.

12:20.087 --> 12:21.725
What is that?

12:28.327 --> 12:30.636
-Tillman?
-Oh, it used to be.

12:32.167 --> 12:35.159
Emma, you get out of there right now.
Come on.

12:38.767 --> 12:40.325
Come on. Come on.

12:40.407 --> 12:42.557
There you go. There you go.

12:42.807 --> 12:44.877
There you go. Careful. All right.

12:46.167 --> 12:47.520
Come on.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.524
Now do you believe it's a giant crocodile?

12:51.607 --> 12:54.167
Doesn't mean anything, Frank.
It's just another piece of the puzzle.

12:54.247 --> 12:57.319
Piece of the puzzle?
We got his foot. We got his arm.

12:57.407 --> 12:58.920
And now we got his head!

12:59.007 --> 13:00.520
What other pieces do you need?

13:00.607 --> 13:03.565
Mills, shut up! You're not being any help.

13:03.647 --> 13:06.241
We're all on the same team here. Come on.

13:06.447 --> 13:09.405
Let's go talk to crazy Sadie.

13:28.127 --> 13:30.402
All right, we finally made it.

13:30.967 --> 13:33.242
That was some shortcut, genius.

13:33.487 --> 13:34.966
Hey, we made it, didn't we?

13:35.047 --> 13:38.164
Yeah, Mike.
You're a regular Ferdinand Magellan.

13:42.607 --> 13:44.484
The water looks great.

13:45.127 --> 13:46.480
Absolutely.

13:55.207 --> 13:57.482
Don't get any big ideas, sport.

13:58.047 --> 13:59.924
She gets her own tent.

14:00.247 --> 14:01.362
Okay.

14:18.927 --> 14:22.124
Must be hard for a sweet old lady
to live out here all by herself.

14:22.207 --> 14:24.038
Sadie's not that sweet.

14:24.127 --> 14:26.118
She's definitely no lady.

14:26.607 --> 14:29.405
You are right about the old part, though.

14:30.887 --> 14:33.276
Why don't you let me talk to her?

14:35.847 --> 14:38.122
-Be my guest, Emma.
-All right.

14:51.247 --> 14:53.317
Hi. Mrs Sadie Bickerman?

14:53.927 --> 14:55.645
I'm Emma Warner from Fish and Wildlife,

14:55.727 --> 14:57.797
and I'm so sorry to bother you,
but I was just wondering,

14:57.887 --> 14:59.525
can we come in and ask you
a few questions?

14:59.607 --> 15:01.279
Fish and Wildlife?

15:01.767 --> 15:05.396
Haven't been a lick of livestock
on this property since I lost my sister.

15:05.487 --> 15:07.842
Unless you got some answers
for me on that,

15:07.927 --> 15:11.203
why in the world would I want
to talk to you jerks?

15:11.807 --> 15:14.321
Oh, I didn't know.

15:15.127 --> 15:16.958
-What?
-I'm sorry. I was just...

15:17.047 --> 15:19.641
Can we just come in for a minute?
We won't be long.

15:19.727 --> 15:22.287
You're right. You won't.

15:28.047 --> 15:29.844
Wow. You're great with the elderly.

15:29.927 --> 15:32.202
You want to try? Be my guest.

15:39.807 --> 15:42.480
This is Sheriff Riley, Sadie. Open up!

15:47.047 --> 15:49.641
I'm sorry. Wasn't that clear enough, Sheriff?

15:49.727 --> 15:52.799
Sadie, we found a man's head
about 200 yards off your dock.

15:52.887 --> 15:55.276
Wanted to know if you got
any information about it.

15:55.367 --> 15:56.720
I'm an old lady.

15:56.807 --> 16:00.243
Unless you think I chopped off
some poor sap's melon,

16:00.527 --> 16:01.880
I don't know how I can help.

16:01.967 --> 16:03.844
Well, you can start by telling us
anything you know

16:03.927 --> 16:06.566
about any crocodiles wandering
into the fresh water of our lake.

16:06.647 --> 16:09.286
I understand that your sister
had quite a history with crocs.

16:09.367 --> 16:11.642
Don't you mention my sister.
I don't know squat.

16:11.727 --> 16:15.845
Till you get yourself a warrant,
you can go piss up a rope, Columbo!

16:19.607 --> 16:20.642
That was great.

16:20.727 --> 16:22.319
Get lost, Barney Miller!

16:27.367 --> 16:29.323
Crazy Sadie knows something. I can feel it.

16:29.407 --> 16:31.443
She's right.
We can't search her place without a warrant.

16:31.527 --> 16:34.837
Yeah, but she can't stop us
from searching the lake.

16:54.407 --> 16:55.726
What's wrong?

16:55.807 --> 16:58.002
Nothing. I'm just really hot.

16:58.087 --> 17:00.237
I think I'm gonna come in and take a swim.

17:00.327 --> 17:02.238
Well, hurry up then.

17:05.847 --> 17:07.723
Oh, boy.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.561
Very funny. I'll be right there.

17:28.847 --> 17:32.760
Sharon? Sharon? Edie?

17:33.127 --> 17:35.357
Come on, now. This isn't funny.

18:24.767 --> 18:26.200
No! Stop it!

18:28.007 --> 18:29.998
Gosh, I'm sorry about that.

18:30.087 --> 18:31.918
She's very territorial.

18:32.007 --> 18:33.360
No worries.

18:33.807 --> 18:35.684
It's healthy to get your heart rate up, right?

18:35.767 --> 18:37.803
Yeah, beats the treadmill.

18:37.887 --> 18:41.243
-You're Sheriff Riley's son.
-Yeah, unfortunately.

18:41.807 --> 18:44.037
Hi, I'm Scott.

18:44.127 --> 18:45.446
I'm Kerri.

18:45.527 --> 18:47.802
This morning your dad said
you had something to tell me.

18:47.887 --> 18:51.880
What? No, no, no. He's just... Ignore him.

18:52.647 --> 18:55.115
-You okay?
-Yeah, yeah, I'm cool.

18:55.727 --> 18:57.445
You are far from cool, buddy.

18:57.527 --> 18:58.846
Shut up, Thad.

18:58.927 --> 19:00.679
Scott, this is Thad.

19:04.087 --> 19:06.681
Looks like you almost
wet your pants there, pal.

19:06.767 --> 19:10.203
Trust me, nothing in this podunk town's
gonna make me wet my pants.

19:10.287 --> 19:11.515
Oh, yeah? Where are you from?

19:11.607 --> 19:13.837
I live in Newton,
just outside of Boston, with my mom.

19:13.927 --> 19:16.316
Oh, I love Boston. I just got accepted to BC,

19:16.407 --> 19:19.285
but I haven't decided
if I'm gonna go there or Northeastern, so...

19:19.367 --> 19:21.756
I think she should stay some place
close to home.

19:21.847 --> 19:24.122
Yeah, well, it's not really your decision.

19:24.207 --> 19:27.643
Boston is awesome. I mean, I wish
I could've stayed there for the summer,

19:27.727 --> 19:30.560
but since my folks split,
my dad thought I should come up here.

19:30.647 --> 19:33.002
-Scott's dad is Sheriff Riley.
-No way!

19:33.087 --> 19:36.875
Doesn't that gay-ass have anything better
to do than bust up all our parties?

19:36.967 --> 19:39.765
No, don't worry. I know he's a buzz kill.

19:40.327 --> 19:43.558
Look, a bunch of us are gonna go hike over
the other side of lake, camp overnight.

19:43.647 --> 19:46.400
If you wanna come,
you're more than welcome.

19:46.487 --> 19:48.000
Sure. Definitely.

19:48.127 --> 19:50.402
Baby, when did you become
chairman of the welcoming committee?

19:50.487 --> 19:51.966
Don't be a jerk, okay?

19:52.047 --> 19:56.643
The least we can do is show him
that we're not a bunch of hicks around here.

19:57.567 --> 20:01.082
You got any more beers in your bag,
or is your daddy gonna arrest us?

20:01.167 --> 20:03.237
I'm not worried about it.

20:06.567 --> 20:07.716
Okay, great. It's settled.

20:07.807 --> 20:12.005
So, let's go meet up with Rachel and Larry,
and we'll grab our gear.

20:21.247 --> 20:22.441
Daisy!

20:34.607 --> 20:36.279
So many visitors this time of day,

20:36.367 --> 20:39.564
you'd think this old lady
was running a brothel.

20:39.687 --> 20:42.679
Oh, come on now, sexy at 70 is what I'd say.

20:42.967 --> 20:45.197
Well, aren't you the charmer?

20:45.407 --> 20:49.286
It's true. You have very beautiful eyes,
and eyes have no age.

20:51.607 --> 20:54.565
-Now, Mrs Bickerman...
-Oh, call me Sadie.

20:54.927 --> 20:57.964
Well, then, now, Sadie,
let's start right at the beginning,

20:58.047 --> 21:00.925
and you tell me everything those folks said.

21:01.567 --> 21:04.081
Oh, there those little rascals go.

21:04.167 --> 21:06.635
They get riled up this time of day.

21:07.687 --> 21:11.726
That reminds me,
I promised I'd make you a snack.

21:11.887 --> 21:14.606
No, don't worry. I'm fine.
I just have a few questions.

21:14.687 --> 21:16.200
You sit right there.

21:16.287 --> 21:17.959
Be back in a jiffy.

21:18.047 --> 21:20.038
I'm not really hungry, Sadie.

21:20.127 --> 21:22.004
Who said anything about
it being your snack?

21:22.087 --> 21:23.156
What's that?

21:23.247 --> 21:27.206
Out, get out closer to the edge.
You'll get a much better shot.

21:51.927 --> 21:54.157
What the hell is that?

22:18.687 --> 22:20.917
Guess he really wasn't hungry.

22:34.527 --> 22:36.245
So, what now, James?

22:36.807 --> 22:39.844
We'll drag the lake,
see if we can find the rest of his friend.

22:39.927 --> 22:41.758
You think you're gonna find him, huh?

22:41.847 --> 22:45.601
I'll bet you anything he's in the stomach
of that crocodile.

22:50.367 --> 22:52.039
Frank! Hang on!

22:52.407 --> 22:53.726
-Come on.
-Help!

22:53.807 --> 22:56.640
Come on! Come on, we just hit a rock.

22:56.727 --> 22:59.241
A rock's not gonna bite you.
Get out of there.

22:59.327 --> 23:00.806
Come on. Come on.

23:00.887 --> 23:03.082
Up we go. Get up here.

23:03.847 --> 23:05.246
All right, all right.

23:05.327 --> 23:09.161
Get Mills a towel, would you?
Come on. Get up. Get up.

23:09.247 --> 23:11.363
Frank, you're being ridiculous.

23:11.447 --> 23:14.280
I'm telling you, a local gossip
and a superstitious old lady

23:14.367 --> 23:17.439
still don't make
a giant man-eating crocodile.

23:18.087 --> 23:19.236
What?

23:36.407 --> 23:37.522
Emma!

23:40.087 --> 23:41.918
Emma, swim to me now.

23:56.327 --> 23:58.079
-Can you swim?
-Yeah.

24:03.647 --> 24:05.683
Come on! Come on! Hurry up!

24:09.367 --> 24:12.165
Hurry up! Come on! Let's go! There it is!

24:29.047 --> 24:30.844
No crocodiles in Maine, huh?

24:30.927 --> 24:34.237
That's got to be the biggest animal
I've ever seen.

24:35.207 --> 24:36.799
Great, tourists.

24:37.767 --> 24:39.359
It's no tourist.

24:42.887 --> 24:45.117
How well do you know this guy?

24:45.967 --> 24:48.197
I caught him poaching
some endangered bobcats

24:48.287 --> 24:50.403
a couple years back
up near the Canadian border,

24:50.487 --> 24:52.682
just a typical greedy industrialist.

24:52.767 --> 24:55.645
Only this one fancies himself
a great white hunter.

24:55.727 --> 24:58.400
His ego's twice as big as that crocodile.

24:58.487 --> 24:59.806
Hi.

25:02.367 --> 25:03.720
Emma.

25:04.367 --> 25:07.200
Never fancied you for the wet T-shirt type.

25:08.407 --> 25:11.160
Good to see our tax dollars hard at work.

25:11.847 --> 25:13.405
What are you doing here, Struthers?

25:13.487 --> 25:17.526
Well, I got a tip from a local there might
be something worth killing in this lake.

25:17.607 --> 25:19.438
The tip didn't happen to come
from a local weasel

25:19.527 --> 25:21.483
by the name of Cal Miner, did it?

25:21.567 --> 25:24.161
Perhaps you should be grateful
to that weasel.

25:24.247 --> 25:27.956
From the looks of things,
the cavalry got here just in the nick of time.

25:28.047 --> 25:30.925
Tell you what, you can park
your plane there, $40 a day.

25:31.007 --> 25:33.999
We don't take Visa.
We don't take MasterCard.

25:35.287 --> 25:39.326
Oh, by the way, Emma,
did you get them bobcat kebabs I sent you?

25:41.487 --> 25:42.840
She likes me.

25:42.927 --> 25:44.076
Yeah.

25:59.047 --> 26:02.642
Are we close yet?
'Cause my feet are totally killing me.

26:02.767 --> 26:04.598
Rachel, when I told you
to wear appropriate shoes,

26:04.687 --> 26:07.281
strappy sandals weren't what I had in mind.

26:07.367 --> 26:10.439
Vogue says these are totally appropriate
for summer.

26:10.527 --> 26:11.880
Whatever. This is so lame.

26:11.967 --> 26:14.037
You know, I'll rub them if you want.

26:14.127 --> 26:16.163
I'll rub the rest of you, too.

26:16.247 --> 26:19.080
Seriously, Larry,
I wouldn't let you rub my feet,

26:19.167 --> 26:21.681
even if you were the CEO of Prada.

26:23.207 --> 26:24.560
Your loss.

26:27.327 --> 26:29.761
This is it, suckers. Check it out!

26:31.047 --> 26:32.605
This is sweet.

26:46.407 --> 26:48.796
-Oh, hey, check this out, Larry.
-What?

26:48.887 --> 26:50.115
-No, right here. Come here.
-What?

26:50.207 --> 26:52.004
-Come here and check this out. Right here.
-What?

26:52.087 --> 26:53.645
-No, right here. Come here, closer.
-What?

26:53.727 --> 26:57.083
-You see, right there? Just...
-I don't see anything.

26:59.647 --> 27:02.286
My bad, I guess there was nothing there.

27:02.367 --> 27:05.643
Way to go, butthead.
What am I supposed to wear now?

27:13.647 --> 27:17.037
Scott, could you give me a hand?
I can't get my back.

27:20.487 --> 27:21.840
Yeah, sure.

27:26.967 --> 27:30.516
Hey, looks like Boston boy's
making a move on your girl.

27:30.767 --> 27:32.439
He can have her.

27:34.287 --> 27:36.482
So, you guys gonna go in?

27:36.607 --> 27:40.395
No, I don't want to get my hair wet.
I'm just gonna lay out.

27:40.727 --> 27:42.445
I bronze amazingly.

27:42.687 --> 27:45.963
Come on, Scott.
Last one in's gotta pitch the tent.

27:46.287 --> 27:48.642
Larry's already pitching a tent.

27:48.727 --> 27:51.446
Yeah, I can tell by the way you guys
are wrestling around in the water.

27:51.527 --> 27:53.722
No, baby. This is all for you, sweetheart.

27:53.807 --> 27:55.240
You're a pig.

27:56.287 --> 27:58.960
So, come on, Scott, what do you say?
Coming in?

28:00.287 --> 28:02.243
No, I'm not in the mood.

28:03.047 --> 28:04.685
Afraid you're gonna get your hair wet?

28:04.767 --> 28:07.565
No, I'm just not a big fan of the water.

28:07.767 --> 28:09.678
He can keep me company.

28:11.367 --> 28:12.880
Come on, baby.

28:16.607 --> 28:17.676
Hey, come on, man.

28:17.767 --> 28:21.157
I'm gonna go for a walk.
Check things out a little bit.

28:21.247 --> 28:22.726
Suit yourself.

28:47.247 --> 28:48.680
Hey, Sheriff!

28:50.127 --> 28:52.436
Thanks for coming out so quick, Dale.

28:52.527 --> 28:55.166
I brought exactly what you told me to.

28:56.447 --> 28:58.483
A heck of a lot of heat in this puppy.

28:58.567 --> 29:01.081
What are you planning on blowing...

29:01.767 --> 29:03.598
What is all this, then?

29:03.847 --> 29:05.997
Oh, we gotta have a talk.

29:07.407 --> 29:09.398
This thing really work?

29:09.887 --> 29:12.481
Dale, unload the boat.

29:23.967 --> 29:25.559
You know what, Ahmad?

29:25.647 --> 29:28.286
I think I'd like it better if
the flap of the tent was facing east,

29:28.367 --> 29:31.165
that way I get a good view
of the morning sunrise.

29:31.247 --> 29:35.286
Actually, boss, you don't want the opening
facing uphill, in case it rains.

29:35.367 --> 29:37.517
No, it's all right. Do it my way.

29:37.607 --> 29:41.441
Struthers, I decided to close the lake.
That means no camping.

29:41.927 --> 29:44.395
Of course, you and your little pal there
are always welcome

29:44.487 --> 29:47.604
to check in any one of
our lovely B&Bs in town.

29:47.807 --> 29:50.275
Well, you're not gonna run us in to jail, now,
are you, Sheriff?

29:50.367 --> 29:52.278
I mean, it would be a terrific waste
of manpower,

29:52.367 --> 29:55.325
especially when you got this giant crocodile
on the loose.

29:55.407 --> 29:57.125
Why don't you just get out of here?

29:57.207 --> 29:59.118
I'm sure there are a bunch of
unemployed 10-year-olds in Asia

29:59.207 --> 30:00.560
you could be exploiting.

30:00.647 --> 30:01.716
Come on, now, Emma.

30:01.807 --> 30:04.924
You're not still holding a grudge
about them silly bobcats, are you?

30:05.007 --> 30:08.124
There were 148 of those silly bobcats
left on the entire planet.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.516
Now there are 146, thanks to you.

30:10.607 --> 30:12.757
Can you leave it go? I paid the fines.

30:12.847 --> 30:15.236
Everything's not all about the bottom line.

30:15.327 --> 30:18.524
Well then, the bottom line is,
if I didn't come along at the time I did,

30:18.607 --> 30:21.201
you'd still be an endangered species.

30:21.567 --> 30:23.364
I hope you didn't think
you could just fly in here

30:23.447 --> 30:24.766
and kill an animal that may very well be

30:24.847 --> 30:27.042
the last remaining one of its kind.

30:27.127 --> 30:29.402
Well, of course I can.
Isn't that right, Sheriff?

30:29.487 --> 30:32.081
I'm afraid it's not my call.
It's Emma's jurisdiction.

30:32.167 --> 30:33.919
All I can do is ask you to show me permits

30:34.007 --> 30:36.362
for all the firepower
you brought along with you.

30:36.447 --> 30:39.086
Ahmad has all the paperwork you need.

30:39.607 --> 30:41.438
-Good.
-That's great.

30:41.527 --> 30:43.802
You're not gonna be able to use it.

30:43.887 --> 30:45.684
We're doing this the humane way.

30:45.767 --> 30:49.760
We're gonna trap it and bring it in alive.
Do you wanna help me?

30:50.447 --> 30:52.119
Well, that's brilliant!

30:52.207 --> 30:54.960
I can see us all holding hands
in the belly of the beast

30:55.047 --> 30:57.197
singing Give Peace a Chance.

30:57.767 --> 30:59.519
Oh, please, shut up.

31:01.127 --> 31:03.595
I think she really likes me, Ahmad.

31:43.487 --> 31:44.761
Damn it!

32:10.167 --> 32:11.566
What the...

32:27.207 --> 32:29.596
Crocodiles bite down into
the flesh of a victim

32:29.687 --> 32:30.756
and roll over and over until

32:30.847 --> 32:33.281
the disoriented prey drowns
or bleeds to death.

32:33.367 --> 32:34.959
It's called a death roll.

32:35.047 --> 32:36.958
-lt sounds like something to avoid.
-Oh, yeah.

32:37.047 --> 32:39.038
Well, you know,
they're perfect killing machines.

32:39.127 --> 32:43.006
And get this. It wedges the body
of its victim into an underwater pantry

32:43.087 --> 32:44.566
for future consumption.

32:44.647 --> 32:48.560
Well, when we're through here, we'll have
plenty of crocodile steaks in our pantry, eh?

32:48.647 --> 32:50.444
Boots and belts, too.

32:51.927 --> 32:54.566
I got a question for the two of youse.

32:56.207 --> 32:57.925
Let me ask you this, geniuses.

32:58.007 --> 33:00.680
What are you planning on using for bait?

33:01.607 --> 33:03.120
Sorry about this, baby.

33:03.207 --> 33:06.085
-You're kidding. That's your bait?
-Come on.

33:09.407 --> 33:11.602
-There's no way this is gonna work.
-Come on, Dale.

33:11.687 --> 33:13.166
Crocodiles eat turtles.
Look it up in Struthers' book.

33:13.247 --> 33:14.680
Get in there.

33:19.047 --> 33:22.676
-He's one heck of a turtle.
-I don't like this plan.

33:22.767 --> 33:26.680
-They growed up in a hole like this.
-Dale, would you be quiet?

33:30.847 --> 33:34.760
Well, now, that is absolutely brilliant.

33:35.207 --> 33:38.244
You do realise the thing has eaten
a human being, don't you?

33:38.327 --> 33:41.125
That's right. Get in there, Struthers.

33:41.687 --> 33:45.043
I suppose you'd prefer
if we just lobbed in a landmine.

33:45.127 --> 33:46.321
That's way too messy.

33:46.407 --> 33:48.921
Besides, where's the sport in that?

33:53.047 --> 33:54.446
Anybody keeping kosher?

33:54.527 --> 33:57.121
No, no, no, no, don't even think about it.
Struthers...

33:57.207 --> 33:59.038
Can you help me get this out of here
before it hurts itself?

33:59.127 --> 34:00.401
We'll get it.

34:00.887 --> 34:03.082
Dale, hand me the stick.

34:03.167 --> 34:05.362
-Dale!
-Just...

34:05.447 --> 34:08.041
-Thank you.
-Just be careful. Don't hurt it.

34:08.127 --> 34:10.687
I won't. All right, let's see.

34:10.766 --> 34:15.636
-One... Can I reach it? Two... One more.
-It's okay.

34:15.726 --> 34:17.001
Ready?

34:20.487 --> 34:22.762
Dale, hand me the tranq gun.

34:22.967 --> 34:24.446
Yes, sir.

34:24.527 --> 34:26.757
Come on, tranq gun! Right now!

34:40.127 --> 34:44.438
You can't just spray and pray.
You gotta know what you're shooting at.

34:54.607 --> 34:56.882
I think you got him, Sheriff.

34:57.327 --> 34:58.601
What now?

35:05.727 --> 35:07.080
Wait! Stop!

35:10.047 --> 35:11.526
You killed it!

35:12.367 --> 35:15.359
No, I think the tranquiliser's
just taken effect.

35:15.447 --> 35:18.041
Come on, let's tie up its snout.
I don't think we'll have much time.

35:18.127 --> 35:19.879
-Here, let me do that.
-No, it's okay. I got it.

35:19.967 --> 35:23.164
-Well, this here's man's work, sweetheart.
-Okay.

35:25.127 --> 35:26.958
Dale, be careful.

35:27.367 --> 35:29.323
Don't worry, sir. I got it covered.

35:29.407 --> 35:32.479
This here's what we call a four-point granny.

35:33.887 --> 35:37.516
I learnt it in the Boy Scouts.
Not so tough now, are you?

36:09.487 --> 36:12.285
Well, so much for the humane thing.

36:13.327 --> 36:14.965
Now it's my turn.

36:16.647 --> 36:17.921
Me first.

36:20.367 --> 36:21.516
Mine's bigger.

36:21.607 --> 36:23.677
It's all in how you use it.

36:24.007 --> 36:25.565
So, what do you say now, Ms Warner?

36:25.647 --> 36:28.241
You still wanna make friends with it?

36:30.407 --> 36:32.204
I thought you'd come around
sooner or later.

36:32.287 --> 36:34.801
Too bad for your friends it was later.

36:34.887 --> 36:38.721
What do you say, Ahmad?
Let's strap up and go kill us a croc.

36:40.287 --> 36:41.561
I thought you knew what you were doing.

36:41.647 --> 36:43.603
I do know what I'm doing,
if you'd just let me do it.

36:43.687 --> 36:46.360
-Figure it out.
-Get the one over there.

36:49.327 --> 36:50.646
Oh, baby.

36:50.967 --> 36:54.004
Hey, sweetheart.
Please don't burn my fun bags.

36:56.407 --> 36:58.204
Oh, Larry, don't be such a stupid American.

36:58.287 --> 37:00.198
All the beaches in Europe are topless.

37:00.287 --> 37:01.481
We are so going there.

37:01.567 --> 37:02.716
Yes, we are.

37:02.807 --> 37:04.445
Guys, come quick.

37:04.727 --> 37:06.365
Seriously, you guys gotta come
check this out.

37:06.447 --> 37:08.324
-Scott, what is it?
-Just come on.

37:08.407 --> 37:10.045
I'm over nature time. Have a ball.

37:10.127 --> 37:11.765
I'll go with you.

37:11.887 --> 37:13.764
Well, I'm coming, too, then.

37:13.847 --> 37:14.916
Don't mind me, guys.

37:15.007 --> 37:18.477
I'm gonna make sure
my little monkeys there don't get toasty.

37:18.567 --> 37:22.007
Would you believe me if I told you
I'm completely rich? Filthy?

37:39.487 --> 37:41.478
Where'd you find... Ahmad, is it?

37:41.567 --> 37:43.319
Yeah, me one-man army.

37:43.407 --> 37:45.557
In the Sudan I was on safari.

37:45.647 --> 37:48.605
Heard about this lion
that was terrorising a small village.

37:48.687 --> 37:50.405
Killed 16 natives.

37:50.487 --> 37:53.240
I went looking for it
but I couldn't find anything for two weeks.

37:53.327 --> 37:56.524
Then one night I hear this wild screaming
from the brush.

37:56.607 --> 37:59.326
Ahmad had found it gnawing
on his mother's throat.

37:59.407 --> 38:02.763
And even though he was barely a teenager
he jumped on it with his bare hands.

38:02.847 --> 38:04.166
Actually put up a hell of a fight.

38:04.247 --> 38:05.885
That's where he got the scars, huh?

38:05.967 --> 38:08.561
I don't suppose there's any unsolved crime
in your town, is there, Sheriff?

38:08.647 --> 38:10.239
I don't suppose there's any more
to your story, is there?

38:10.327 --> 38:11.362
-I'm afraid so.
-All right.

38:11.447 --> 38:14.757
Anyhow, I heard the commotion,
ran in and killed the beast,

38:14.847 --> 38:16.724
and Ahmad's been with me ever since.

38:16.807 --> 38:20.595
He comes in very handy
when there's a bit of dirty work to be done.

38:20.687 --> 38:24.521
It sounds to me like you're taking advantage
of the situation.

38:28.527 --> 38:30.677
All set, boss.

38:32.727 --> 38:34.080
There it is.

38:34.167 --> 38:38.080
-I've never seen anything like it before.
-What is it? Girls' panties?

38:38.167 --> 38:39.236
Funny stuff.

38:39.327 --> 38:42.637
You should take your act on the road,
maybe open up for Jeff Foxworthy.

38:42.727 --> 38:44.922
I wish. That guy's hilarious.

38:45.087 --> 38:46.679
So, where is it?

38:46.887 --> 38:48.525
It's right there.

38:48.687 --> 38:51.326
-Holy shit!
-It's creepy.

38:51.607 --> 38:53.404
It looks like a grave or something.

38:53.487 --> 38:55.557
Totally. Let's check it out up close.

38:55.647 --> 38:57.000
I think that's a bad idea.

38:57.087 --> 38:58.884
Yeah, Thad, I agree.
I think we should get outta here.

38:58.967 --> 39:02.039
You both do what you want.
I'm checking it out.

39:07.047 --> 39:08.765
Come on, you sissies.

39:13.927 --> 39:16.122
Frankie, it's past 1 2:00.

39:16.527 --> 39:18.563
"Sporting purpose, automatic shotgun."

39:18.647 --> 39:20.638
SPAS-1 2. That's what they call an acronym.

39:20.727 --> 39:22.524
I know what an acronym is, Struthers.

39:22.607 --> 39:24.916
You never cease to amaze me, Sheriff.

39:25.007 --> 39:27.919
Anyway, I dropped a black bear
in Montana with this.

39:28.007 --> 39:31.920
Six rounds at close range,
and it fell like a sack of nails.

39:32.007 --> 39:34.805
You know, I never quite understood
the whole sport of the hunting thing.

39:34.887 --> 39:38.402
I prefer sports where my opponent
knows they're playing.

39:40.767 --> 39:43.122
That's a nice gun. What the heck is that?

39:43.207 --> 39:48.839
This, my friend,
is a Milkor MGL-140 grenade launcher.

39:48.927 --> 39:52.442
Hit point targets from 200 feet,
area targets from 400

39:52.527 --> 39:55.917
and it doesn't matter
whether you're drunk or sober.

39:59.047 --> 40:03.757
After seeing what we're up against,
that little baby just might come in handy.

40:10.087 --> 40:11.236
Emma.

40:13.207 --> 40:16.244
Hey. You all right?

40:20.007 --> 40:21.838
You've got to snap out of it, girl.

40:21.927 --> 40:24.725
You made a call.
You did what you thought was right.

40:24.807 --> 40:26.286
I killed them.

40:27.447 --> 40:29.915
Sure, they're dead.

40:30.007 --> 40:32.646
They got chewed up into little pieces,

40:32.727 --> 40:34.604
but they knew what was going on
when they went in.

40:34.687 --> 40:38.282
They chose to do it anyway.
Come on, it's not your fault.

40:39.527 --> 40:43.964
Look, the important thing right now is
that we stop this thing

40:44.047 --> 40:46.800
before it kills either one of us, right?

40:48.247 --> 40:50.556
It wouldn't be a bad idea
to make sure that Struthers

40:50.647 --> 40:53.559
and his pal don't destroy this entire lake
in the process.

40:53.647 --> 40:56.445
There's still some good fish in this lake.

40:59.287 --> 41:00.515
Come on.

41:23.207 --> 41:24.481
Dumb dog.

41:32.087 --> 41:36.046
I told you to stay away from my feet, Larry.
You freaking perv!

41:37.087 --> 41:38.918
Rachel, that's not me!

41:47.847 --> 41:50.441
Larry! Help me!

41:50.527 --> 41:51.880
I'm trying.

41:54.407 --> 41:55.806
Oh, my God!

42:00.367 --> 42:02.039
Rachel! I'm sorry!

42:04.087 --> 42:07.921
Help! Help!

42:25.927 --> 42:27.997
Did you two have a nice romantic walk?

42:28.087 --> 42:29.998
Do you have to get my boat that bloody?

42:30.087 --> 42:33.397
You want your crocodile dead?
You let Ahmad do what he does best.

42:33.487 --> 42:34.556
He learnt from the best.

42:34.647 --> 42:36.444
I've already got one mangled boat
to account for,

42:36.527 --> 42:39.917
not to mention a deputy's family
I've got to deliver some bad news to.

42:40.007 --> 42:42.282
I'll tell you what,
I'll pay the damages to your boat.

42:42.367 --> 42:44.005
As to your deputy, well, that's your problem.

42:44.087 --> 42:45.156
Yeah, I'll tell you what,

42:45.247 --> 42:47.203
I'm responsible for that boat,
so I'm gonna drive it.

42:47.287 --> 42:48.766
-Don't touch it.
-Whatever you say, Sheriff.

42:48.847 --> 42:51.042
Just stay out of Ahmad's way.

43:00.167 --> 43:01.486
You about ready?

43:01.567 --> 43:05.685
I'd love to get this over with tonight
so we can fly out of this dump.

43:05.767 --> 43:07.405
Don't know, boss.

43:07.607 --> 43:10.485
Something about this one
doesn't seem right.

43:11.127 --> 43:15.120
-We may not leave this place.
-Ahmad, come on, now, you must be joking.

43:15.207 --> 43:17.767
We've been in a hell of a lot
worse places than this.

43:17.847 --> 43:19.326
Remember them hammerheads
down in Ecuador,

43:19.407 --> 43:22.524
or those snakeheads in...
What was that miserable place? Baltimore.

43:22.607 --> 43:24.325
This is different.

43:24.407 --> 43:28.400
Real big, real smart,
fast on water and on land...

43:28.767 --> 43:32.965
Well, we just bring it to the surface,
let it wear itself out,

43:33.047 --> 43:36.403
bring the plane in,
we get one clean kill-shot and it's over.

43:36.487 --> 43:38.079
We'll be fine.

43:44.767 --> 43:45.916
Here.

43:48.007 --> 43:50.157
What do you think built this thing?

43:50.247 --> 43:51.885
Probably a witch.

43:52.207 --> 43:54.084
Wait, don't turn around.
She's right behind you.

43:54.167 --> 43:55.759
Shut up, stupid.

43:57.527 --> 43:59.040
Shut up, Thad.

43:59.967 --> 44:01.798
There's a bunch more in there.

44:01.887 --> 44:04.242
They look like eggs of some kind.

44:04.327 --> 44:05.601
Maybe you should put them back.

44:05.687 --> 44:08.440
You're crazy.
I've never seen an egg like this.

44:08.527 --> 44:10.483
No, maybe he's right.
Maybe we should put them back.

44:10.567 --> 44:12.523
Kerri, put it back, please.

44:12.607 --> 44:15.041
Okay. What kind of egg is it, smart guy?

44:15.167 --> 44:18.842
A chicken. I don't know,
a lizard or a snake, or something.

44:19.647 --> 44:20.875
Thad, don't!

44:20.967 --> 44:22.559
Yeah, not smart.

44:23.167 --> 44:26.159
Wait. I think I know what kind of egg it is.

44:27.727 --> 44:29.160
Scrambled.

44:30.247 --> 44:31.805
Kerri, I'm outta here.

44:31.887 --> 44:34.355
Oh, what's up? You scared, city boy?

44:34.447 --> 44:35.516
Eggs ain't gonna hurt you.

44:35.607 --> 44:38.599
No, but whatever laid it might,
you dumb hick.

44:39.687 --> 44:42.918
Don't start something you can't finish.
It'll be your darkest hour.

44:43.007 --> 44:45.919
Stop it, Thad! You're being such a juvenile!

44:46.767 --> 44:48.200
Oh, I get it.

44:48.287 --> 44:50.482
This turd rolls into town
and suddenly I'm a big prick?

44:50.567 --> 44:52.364
You want her, Scottie boy? Take her.

44:52.447 --> 44:54.244
I don't need no chick telling me what's what.

44:54.327 --> 44:56.443
Besides, she's gonna head off
to college and leave me

44:56.527 --> 44:59.325
for some study buddy
or something, anyways.

45:03.207 --> 45:04.560
Oh, sorry.

45:04.647 --> 45:06.126
Are you gonna run and tell its mama,

45:06.207 --> 45:09.916
or are you gonna call your daddy
the Sheriff, so he can arrest me?

45:10.007 --> 45:11.963
Thad, don't turn around.

45:12.047 --> 45:13.765
There's a giant crocodile behind you.

45:13.847 --> 45:16.202
Crocs in this lake? Real funny.

45:16.927 --> 45:18.519
I'm not kidding.

45:18.727 --> 45:19.762
You must think I'm an idiot.

45:19.847 --> 45:22.361
Okay.
So, there's a giant crocodile behind me?

45:22.447 --> 45:23.721
I'm real scared.

45:23.807 --> 45:28.039
Could you guys go get me a tissue?
I think I'm gonna cry.

45:35.967 --> 45:36.956
Hey, hey!

45:45.967 --> 45:47.923
Let's go. Run!

45:50.527 --> 45:52.165
Kerri, come on!

45:52.687 --> 45:55.520
What happened? What is that thing?

45:55.607 --> 45:59.077
My guess is whatever laid those eggs.
She is not happy.

46:18.127 --> 46:21.324
This is Captain Jack Struthers,
your eye in the sky.

46:21.407 --> 46:23.602
I have no visual confirmation.

46:23.687 --> 46:25.564
How about you, sonar?

46:26.327 --> 46:28.318
I don't have anything either.

46:28.407 --> 46:32.559
Just making sure you're still awake.
I can't do this all by myself.

46:40.047 --> 46:42.083
Struthers a pretty good pilot?

46:42.167 --> 46:43.680
No, not really.

46:44.527 --> 46:47.325
He's failed every flight test known to man.

46:47.407 --> 46:51.923
He's crashed three times already.
Once was even into an elementary school.

46:53.207 --> 46:54.526
Poor kids.

46:55.687 --> 47:00.124
Basically, he's the last person on the Earth
who should be flying a plane.

47:00.727 --> 47:01.842
What?

47:04.167 --> 47:05.839
It was nothing.

47:08.887 --> 47:12.118
Wait. I got it.
It's moving fast towards the boat.

47:12.367 --> 47:13.641
It's coming right up behind you.

47:13.727 --> 47:16.605
James, turn the boat around, and be careful.

47:21.407 --> 47:24.001
Did you hear that, Ahmad? Be ready.

47:30.727 --> 47:32.877
Wait. I lost it. I lost it.

47:35.127 --> 47:37.004
Ahmad, I thought I told you
to check everything.

47:37.087 --> 47:38.805
I did. It was working fine.

47:38.887 --> 47:41.276
Yeah, well, obviously you didn't.

47:46.527 --> 47:48.882
What are you waiting for? Do it!

47:55.807 --> 47:58.765
Wait, it's slowing down. It's slowing down.

48:00.767 --> 48:01.756
They need air.

48:01.847 --> 48:03.326
Let the thing wear itself out.

48:03.407 --> 48:05.921
I'll get it when it comes back up
to the surface.

48:06.007 --> 48:07.645
Wait. I lost it.

48:07.727 --> 48:09.080
I lost it.

48:09.687 --> 48:11.086
It must have bit itself free.

48:11.167 --> 48:13.203
That was a 1500-pound line. It's impossible.

48:13.287 --> 48:16.484
Line snapped clean.
Harpoon must still be in him.

48:35.127 --> 48:37.402
I think you'd better get
another harpoon ready.

48:37.487 --> 48:39.205
There he is! Ahmad, stand down.

48:39.287 --> 48:42.324
I paid for this operation. I get the kill-shot.

48:42.407 --> 48:44.159
No, boss, we got it.

48:44.887 --> 48:46.366
Here it comes.

48:48.127 --> 48:49.446
Play all the games you want.

48:49.527 --> 48:51.836
I'm coming for you, you scaly little bastard.

48:51.927 --> 48:54.680
I'm coming in to lure it away.
I'll be taking the kill-shot.

48:54.767 --> 48:56.485
No, boss. I'm locking in on my shot now.

48:56.567 --> 48:58.285
What is he doing?

48:59.327 --> 49:02.319
He's gonna try to ram us. Shoot it. Shoot it!

49:04.527 --> 49:06.438
What the hell was that?

49:10.167 --> 49:11.486
Damn fool.

49:17.087 --> 49:18.202
Jump.

50:25.167 --> 50:28.523
This is all I could salvage
from my second boat.

50:28.727 --> 50:31.287
I guess we could use it as firewood.

50:31.447 --> 50:33.005
So, you lost two boats.

50:33.087 --> 50:35.282
I lost a plane
and you don't hear me whingeing.

50:35.367 --> 50:36.595
Well, in case you haven't noticed,

50:36.687 --> 50:39.247
I'm not exactly
the Sheriff of Manhattan here, Struthers.

50:39.327 --> 50:42.558
Losing two boats is gonna put
quite a crimp in my town's finances.

50:42.647 --> 50:44.922
Well, I'll pay for your boats.

50:46.767 --> 50:49.520
-Really?
-Yeah. Call it a donation.

50:49.607 --> 50:51.404
I can always use the write-off.

50:51.487 --> 50:53.284
I'll have Ahmad cut you a cheque.

50:53.367 --> 50:54.800
Well, thanks.

50:55.647 --> 50:58.957
Looks like Ahmad likes
to cut things, anyway.

50:59.767 --> 51:02.645
That head's gonna look fantastic
on me wall.

51:04.647 --> 51:07.161
Don't you think it should go
on Ahmad's wall?

51:07.247 --> 51:08.760
He was the one who actually killed it.

51:08.847 --> 51:12.362
Well, one thing I know is that thing
won't be eating any of us anymore.

51:12.447 --> 51:14.244
That's the important thing, isn't it?

51:14.327 --> 51:16.795
Right, I forgot. You came here to save lives.

51:16.887 --> 51:19.879
You're a big hero.
I mean, I particularly like the part where you

51:19.967 --> 51:22.401
pretended to cry
when the croc came after you.

51:22.487 --> 51:24.318
That was really brave.

51:27.247 --> 51:30.637
Ahmad, you wanna hurry up
with them steaks before the fire goes out?

51:30.727 --> 51:34.083
You know what?
You should smoke one of these.

51:34.167 --> 51:37.079
Best thing you ever tasted.

51:37.167 --> 51:38.805
-Smells good.
-Well, it ought to.

51:38.887 --> 51:41.162
$500 per box.

51:41.247 --> 51:45.365
Of course, you know what would go
really well with a good cigar?

51:45.447 --> 51:48.086
Just a wee bit of Scotch.

51:48.167 --> 51:49.156
Well, if you were to have
a wee bit of Scotch,

51:49.247 --> 51:52.557
I think I could forego
the open container violation.

51:52.647 --> 51:56.242
Ahmad, take out that Johnnie Walker Blue,
would you?

51:59.927 --> 52:01.519
Ahmad?

52:01.607 --> 52:04.599
-Get it yourself.
-I beg your pardon?

52:06.247 --> 52:08.317
You have a very poor way
of showing gratitude.

52:08.407 --> 52:13.845
-Gratitude? Well, I keep you employed.
-Employed?

52:13.927 --> 52:15.997
For years I've waited on you.

52:16.087 --> 52:19.636
I've cooked and I've cleaned
and I've killed for you,

52:19.727 --> 52:22.685
and never once a single thank you.

52:22.767 --> 52:26.601
Well, need I remind you
that if it wasn't for me,

52:26.687 --> 52:28.325
you'd still be a lion's dinner?

52:28.407 --> 52:30.875
I saved your life,
so don't talk to me about gratitude.

52:30.967 --> 52:32.958
Oh, I remember that lion.

52:33.047 --> 52:34.036
I remember that lion very well,

52:34.127 --> 52:38.405
but not because it took you four shots
to hit it at point blank range,

52:39.407 --> 52:43.036
including this one and this one.

52:43.127 --> 52:46.085
I remember that lion because
you've reminded me of it every day

52:46.167 --> 52:49.716
for the past 14 years of my life.

52:49.807 --> 52:51.957
Well, this ends today.

52:56.087 --> 53:00.000
My debt to you is paid in full.

53:00.807 --> 53:03.844
I wish you good luck
in finding a new employee.

53:08.207 --> 53:11.005
Yeah, go on. Fine.
Don't need youse, anyway.

53:14.367 --> 53:16.835
Well, I'm turning in for the night.

53:24.247 --> 53:29.037
Tell me something, Struthers,
how long you and Ahmad been married?

53:36.247 --> 53:40.479
I'm sure your view of the sunset
will be worth it tomorrow.

53:40.567 --> 53:43.877
How about being a sport
and helping us out, for old time's sake?

53:43.967 --> 53:46.322
How about you re-pitch your tent
in the lake?

53:46.407 --> 53:48.602
It might be drier.

53:48.687 --> 53:51.918
You think it's really necessary for you
to be enjoying yourself so much?

53:52.007 --> 53:56.683
Maybe now you'll have some respect
for the next man who does your dirty jobs.

54:04.327 --> 54:06.966
Well, I hope you're nice and cosy in there.

54:07.047 --> 54:11.438
-Yes, very comfortable. Thank you.
-Son of a...

54:18.407 --> 54:19.760
Can we stop for a break?

54:19.847 --> 54:23.044
I think we should try and get as far away
from the lake as possible.

54:23.127 --> 54:27.837
Scott, we don't even know where we are.
We've been wandering around for hours.

54:30.527 --> 54:33.678
All right.
Let's try to find a hiding spot, okay?

55:00.527 --> 55:02.199
You comfortable?

55:02.287 --> 55:04.357
Besides being soaking wet,

55:04.447 --> 55:08.326
freezing cold, and hungry enough
to eat an entire HomeTown Buffet?

55:08.407 --> 55:11.001
Yeah, I'm doing excellent.

55:11.087 --> 55:15.558
Yeah, that was
kind of a stupid question, huh?

55:15.647 --> 55:19.037
No. It was sweet. Thanks.

55:20.127 --> 55:22.925
-Hey, it could be worse.
-How?

55:24.567 --> 55:27.001
I could be out here all by myself.

55:39.447 --> 55:42.598
-Oh, God! Thank God it's you guys.
-Larry!

55:42.687 --> 55:44.803
Where's Rachel? Is she okay?

55:44.887 --> 55:47.276
She didn't make it. Where's Thad?

55:49.247 --> 55:51.761
Oh, my God! We're going to die, man!

55:52.607 --> 55:55.917
Listen. We're gonna make it,
but we can't freak out.

55:56.167 --> 55:58.397
We gotta keep moving. Come on.

56:20.447 --> 56:26.795
Ahmad! Ahmad! Ahmad! Ahmad!

56:31.927 --> 56:36.045
Come on! Come on! Go!

56:37.687 --> 56:39.484
Ahmad! Come on!

57:06.407 --> 57:07.396
James!

57:13.527 --> 57:14.516
James!

57:22.487 --> 57:24.398
Ahmad, hang on!

57:30.087 --> 57:31.600
He's gone.

57:47.247 --> 57:48.805
Where's Ahmad?

58:02.927 --> 58:06.317
It's okay. I'm pretty sure
owls have never eaten anybody.

58:06.407 --> 58:08.204
Yeah? How do you know?

58:08.287 --> 58:10.847
I didn't think there was alligators
up in Maine either.

58:10.927 --> 58:13.202
Actually, I think it's a crocodile.

58:13.287 --> 58:16.040
I heard rumours that one got lost
up here several years ago.

58:24.567 --> 58:27.320
Hello? It's Sheriff Riley.
Anybody there? Come in.

58:27.407 --> 58:30.046
Sheriff, Sheriff, I'm here. I'm here.
How are you holding up?

58:30.127 --> 58:31.162
It's not going so good.

58:31.247 --> 58:35.525
There's another of those darn crocodiles
out here, just took out Struthers' man.

58:35.607 --> 58:38.485
Listen, would you please get on the phone
and talk to Mike Hobson Jr?

58:38.567 --> 58:40.205
Tell him we can't wait
around for him anymore.

58:40.287 --> 58:42.482
We need that boat ASAP.

58:42.567 --> 58:43.841
Will do.

58:43.927 --> 58:45.485
Oh, and Sheriff...

58:45.567 --> 58:46.682
What?

58:46.767 --> 58:47.756
I almost forgot.

58:47.847 --> 58:48.962
Scott called over today,

58:49.047 --> 58:51.686
said to tell you he's going camping
with some friends tonight at the lake.

58:51.767 --> 58:53.723
I haven't heard from him since.

58:53.807 --> 58:57.004
I thought I told you to close the lake.
Nobody's supposed to be on the lake.

58:57.087 --> 59:01.478
Yeah, I wasn't entirely sure
what you meant by that.

59:01.567 --> 59:04.525
When I get back to the office
I'm gonna throw a dart at you. Over.

59:04.607 --> 59:05.642
Over.

59:05.727 --> 59:08.764
-Damn it!
-What's up?

59:08.847 --> 59:10.644
My son is out there
somewhere on the lake with his friends.

59:10.727 --> 59:12.524
I gotta go find him.

59:12.607 --> 59:16.202
Well, might as well bring some firepower.

59:16.287 --> 59:18.755
-Bring your acronym.
-My what?

59:20.047 --> 59:22.038
B.Y.A.

59:27.767 --> 59:30.918
He probably went to the campground
over by Crazy Sadie's.

59:42.687 --> 59:44.996
What do we do?

59:45.087 --> 59:47.840
-Run.
-Don't. It's too fast. It'll catch us.

59:47.927 --> 59:49.804
Well, what do we do, then?

59:50.287 --> 59:53.006
-We go up.
-You fucking kidding me?

01:00:19.687 --> 01:00:21.279
-Scott! Watch out!
-Scott!

01:00:21.367 --> 01:00:23.244
Hurry! Move your leg.

01:00:23.327 --> 01:00:24.806
Scott, come on.

01:00:25.967 --> 01:00:27.002
-Get him up! Come on!
-Go. Go!

01:00:27.087 --> 01:00:29.396
-Get up here!
-Keep going!

01:00:34.327 --> 01:00:35.726
What is that?

01:00:35.807 --> 01:00:38.605
-I thought you shut down the lake.
-Yeah, I did shut down the lake.

01:00:38.687 --> 01:00:43.522
We're going to Sadie Bickerman's house,
find out exactly what we're up against.

01:00:52.327 --> 01:00:53.316
Sadie!

01:00:55.647 --> 01:00:57.524
I need to talk to you!

01:00:58.927 --> 01:01:01.566
You're a little late, Sheriff.

01:01:01.647 --> 01:01:03.319
Did you get that warrant,

01:01:03.407 --> 01:01:07.446
or did you just come by
to take a peek at an old lady in a nightie?

01:01:07.527 --> 01:01:09.324
Look, I don't have time for your games.

01:01:09.407 --> 01:01:11.637
I've got some questions.
I need some straight answers.

01:01:11.727 --> 01:01:16.755
Well, unless you're arresting me,
all I got for you is nothing.

01:01:17.687 --> 01:01:20.247
Have it your way, Sadie.
You have the right to remain silent.

01:01:20.327 --> 01:01:24.002
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

01:01:24.087 --> 01:01:28.046
I already told you, I don't know anything
about this crocodile business.

01:01:28.127 --> 01:01:29.116
Sadie!

01:01:29.887 --> 01:01:33.562
I already told you, I have some questions
and I need some damn answers from you.

01:01:33.647 --> 01:01:38.641
I'd ask you all in for a nightcap but I think
you'd all look better in a dunce cap.

01:01:38.727 --> 01:01:40.718
-Listen, Sadie, for crying out loud...
-This is serious.

01:01:40.807 --> 01:01:44.038
-People's lives are at stake.
-Too bad you can't talk to my sister.

01:01:44.127 --> 01:01:46.721
I heard she had quite a history
with crocodiles.

01:01:46.807 --> 01:01:50.800
Sadie, my son is out there right now
somewhere with his friends.

01:01:50.887 --> 01:01:54.118
-My son, Sadie. Please.
-Maybe I know a little something.

01:01:54.207 --> 01:01:55.959
That's great.
Anything you can tell us will help.

01:01:56.047 --> 01:02:01.679
Somebody tell Trixie to shut her cake hole
before I change my mind.

01:02:01.767 --> 01:02:02.756
Emma.

01:02:05.487 --> 01:02:09.082
There are three of them. Okay?

01:02:09.887 --> 01:02:11.240
Three of them?

01:02:14.447 --> 01:02:16.199
There's Max.

01:02:16.927 --> 01:02:22.684
I named him after my late husband because
he was always hungry, like Max was.

01:02:22.767 --> 01:02:26.840
Then there's George Jr,

01:02:26.927 --> 01:02:32.684
named after the President
because he was slow, too.

01:02:32.767 --> 01:02:36.442
And the last one was big girl Martha,

01:02:36.527 --> 01:02:37.801
Martha Stewart,

01:02:39.007 --> 01:02:41.157
pretty tough bird in her own right.

01:02:41.247 --> 01:02:43.966
How do you know she's female?

01:02:44.047 --> 01:02:47.323
She got a mean streak
I ain't never seen in no man.

01:02:48.807 --> 01:02:50.035
Also...

01:02:53.287 --> 01:02:58.077
I caught George Jr trying to stick it to her
one night on the shore.

01:03:00.127 --> 01:03:02.436
I wonder which one of these darlings
Ahmad took out.

01:03:02.527 --> 01:03:05.758
-Struthers.
-Pardon me?

01:03:05.847 --> 01:03:08.361
I just said, they're adorable names.

01:03:09.527 --> 01:03:13.884
Cram it, fancy pants.
You think I'm some dumb cluck.

01:03:13.967 --> 01:03:16.765
-I know what you're trying to do to them!
-Sadie, Sadie, Sadie, Sadie.

01:03:16.847 --> 01:03:21.921
Tell me, what have you been
feeding these things?

01:03:44.847 --> 01:03:45.962
What is it?

01:03:47.967 --> 01:03:50.242
It's nothing. Go back to sleep.

01:04:06.167 --> 01:04:08.317
Oh, my gosh. That's vile.

01:04:08.407 --> 01:04:10.557
Don't tell me you're
one of those vegetarians.

01:04:10.647 --> 01:04:13.684
No, that meat is pumped
so full of growth hormones,

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:15.962
I'm surprised those crocs are still alive.

01:04:16.047 --> 01:04:20.006
Well, I can't afford three tons
of Kobe beef a month.

01:04:20.087 --> 01:04:24.160
My Social Security cheques
ain't what they used to be.

01:04:24.247 --> 01:04:28.240
This is all you been feeding them, Sadie,
beef rejected by the FDA?

01:04:28.327 --> 01:04:29.555
Pretty much.

01:04:29.647 --> 01:04:32.241
I've noticed they've been
a lot hungrier lately.

01:04:32.327 --> 01:04:36.843
Yesterday Martha ate a big rat off my dock.

01:04:39.687 --> 01:04:42.565
We gotta go out and find those kids.

01:04:44.287 --> 01:04:47.518
Sadie, listen, I want to thank you
for giving me this information.

01:04:47.607 --> 01:04:52.123
I know it couldn't have been easy for you.

01:04:52.207 --> 01:04:56.359
When I do what it is I have to do,
I promise I'll be as humane as possible.

01:04:56.447 --> 01:04:57.766
Good luck.

01:05:02.367 --> 01:05:06.918
My babies sure as hell won't be
so humane with you.

01:05:10.847 --> 01:05:14.760
Larry, come on, dude, wake up.

01:05:14.847 --> 01:05:17.566
Larry! Wake up, dude.

01:05:17.647 --> 01:05:21.845
-It's your turn to be lookout.
-Yeah, okay, fine.

01:05:23.287 --> 01:05:28.680
Keep your eyes peeled for that thing.
Wake us up if it goes back into the lake.

01:05:28.767 --> 01:05:33.045
-I know. I'm not stupid.
-lf you say so.

01:05:33.727 --> 01:05:36.924
Oh, no. Scott! Scott?

01:05:39.887 --> 01:05:42.242
Wait a minute. That's not Scott.
I recognise that sneaker.

01:05:42.327 --> 01:05:45.319
That's Thaddeus, old man Sanders' boy.

01:05:46.287 --> 01:05:49.120
-Poor kid.
-Oh, my God.

01:05:50.367 --> 01:05:52.323
What is this thing?

01:05:53.407 --> 01:05:57.446
It's a nest, which means
mama croc is nearby and she's territorial

01:05:57.527 --> 01:05:59.199
and she's hungry and she's ticked.

01:05:59.287 --> 01:06:01.642
-Sounds like the ex-wife.
-It's not funny.

01:06:01.727 --> 01:06:04.480
We need to get these eggs out of here
as soon as possible before they hatch.

01:06:04.567 --> 01:06:05.966
Yeah, let's split up.

01:06:06.047 --> 01:06:07.924
Struthers, stay here with Emma
and help her get the eggs out.

01:06:08.007 --> 01:06:09.440
Get them out?
I think we should blow them up.

01:06:09.527 --> 01:06:11.085
Not a chance.

01:06:11.167 --> 01:06:13.886
We need to get these eggs out of here
and back to the lab as soon as possible.

01:06:13.967 --> 01:06:16.401
Well, whatever the hell it is you do,
do it in a hurry.

01:06:16.487 --> 01:06:18.921
Okay, well, we'll meet you back
at the campsite. You go find Scott?

01:06:19.007 --> 01:06:23.285
All right. Give me the grenade launcher.
Give me the grenade launcher!

01:06:26.207 --> 01:06:27.925
You two be careful.

01:06:28.727 --> 01:06:31.639
-You hear me?
-Yeah.

01:06:35.247 --> 01:06:36.236
Scott!

01:06:55.487 --> 01:06:57.443
Larry, you okay?

01:07:00.127 --> 01:07:02.766
Don't worry, guys. I'm fine.

01:07:02.847 --> 01:07:08.126
-Yo, this ground is really soft.
-Larry, don't move.

01:07:08.207 --> 01:07:10.038
That's not the ground.

01:07:11.567 --> 01:07:14.035
What the heck are you talking about?

01:07:15.007 --> 01:07:16.759
Don't do that.

01:07:27.647 --> 01:07:29.877
Oh, shit!

01:07:29.967 --> 01:07:30.956
Run!

01:07:49.047 --> 01:07:52.676
Scott! Anybody, can you hear me?

01:08:01.327 --> 01:08:02.396
Now's our chance.

01:08:02.487 --> 01:08:03.840
If we hop down and run,
we can make it to the road

01:08:03.927 --> 01:08:06.566
before it gets back,
and then we're home free.

01:08:06.647 --> 01:08:10.003
-I'm not going down there. No way.
-We can't stay up here forever.

01:08:10.087 --> 01:08:12.885
Who knows when help's gonna get here?
It's now or never.

01:08:12.967 --> 01:08:15.481
-You think we can make it?
-Yeah.

01:08:15.567 --> 01:08:20.004
-Okay. You first.
-All right. Keep an eye out.

01:08:25.527 --> 01:08:27.438
Okay. Come on.

01:08:28.607 --> 01:08:30.438
Wait. It's still here.

01:08:40.447 --> 01:08:42.278
We're gonna do it on three.

01:08:42.367 --> 01:08:44.562
-What if it catches us?
-lt won't.

01:08:44.647 --> 01:08:46.603
-I'm scared, Scott.
-Don't be. Ready?

01:08:46.687 --> 01:08:50.157
One, two, three.

01:08:51.767 --> 01:08:53.120
Daisy.

01:08:54.527 --> 01:08:57.678
-Wait! She'll be okay. We gotta run now!
-No!

01:09:00.006 --> 01:09:02.645
-What about Daisy?
-We'll come back for her.

01:09:05.926 --> 01:09:07.076
Scott!

01:09:08.327 --> 01:09:09.919
Scott!

01:09:10.006 --> 01:09:11.359
Get down.

01:09:19.886 --> 01:09:21.399
You two okay?

01:09:24.207 --> 01:09:28.564
-Yeah. Yeah, we're fine. But Thad and...
-Yeah, I know. I saw him.

01:09:28.647 --> 01:09:32.356
I thought for a second he was you.
Is there anybody else out here with you?

01:09:32.447 --> 01:09:34.243
-Long story.
-Tell me on the way out of here.

01:09:34.327 --> 01:09:35.965
We gotta... We gotta leave.

01:09:36.046 --> 01:09:38.277
There's still another one of those
damn things around here somewhere.

01:09:38.367 --> 01:09:39.356
Come on.

01:10:11.367 --> 01:10:13.756
This nest would explain
their sudden aggression.

01:10:13.847 --> 01:10:16.236
Protecting the young is serious business.

01:10:16.327 --> 01:10:18.966
Well, that's truly fascinating.

01:10:19.047 --> 01:10:20.878
But right now I'm more concerned
with the serious business

01:10:20.967 --> 01:10:24.403
of protecting me own arse,
so let's finish this up, huh?

01:10:26.287 --> 01:10:28.960
Here, let me give you a hand with that.

01:10:29.927 --> 01:10:33.363
-You all right?
-Me knees, an old injury.

01:10:33.447 --> 01:10:35.881
-Hunting?
-Tango lessons, actually.

01:10:44.727 --> 01:10:48.959
Sadie! Open up. Hi.

01:10:49.047 --> 01:10:51.163
You must be Sheriff Jr,

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:53.556
I guess you didn't get eaten.

01:10:53.647 --> 01:10:56.798
You know your dad's a dumb doofus,
don't you?

01:10:56.887 --> 01:10:58.400
Yeah.

01:10:58.487 --> 01:11:00.682
-He's a nice boy, Sheriff.
-Thank you...

01:11:00.767 --> 01:11:05.238
Focus. Listen, I need these two
to stay here until backup arrives.

01:11:05.327 --> 01:11:08.922
And I need to go get something
out of your freezer. Thank you.

01:11:09.007 --> 01:11:11.680
Pretty soon I'm gonna have to start
charging you rent.

01:11:11.767 --> 01:11:15.316
-Send a bill to the State.
-Come on in.

01:11:15.407 --> 01:11:18.365
Just make sure you wipe your feet
before you...

01:11:18.447 --> 01:11:20.756
Oh, Lord.

01:11:25.047 --> 01:11:27.322
Look at that. Raised in a barn?

01:11:31.007 --> 01:11:32.440
Come on in.

01:11:33.927 --> 01:11:37.203
Wait! Dad, please let me help you.

01:11:37.287 --> 01:11:41.200
I don't have time to explain this
to you again right now, son.

01:11:42.607 --> 01:11:45.041
What if you don't make it back? Then what?

01:11:45.127 --> 01:11:48.005
If anything were to happen to you out there
I'd never be able to forgive myself.

01:11:48.087 --> 01:11:51.682
It'd be a hell of a lot worse
than me not making it back.

01:11:54.807 --> 01:11:55.796
Look,

01:11:57.447 --> 01:12:00.484
you saved Kerri's life. I'm real proud of you.

01:12:01.847 --> 01:12:05.157
But you gotta stay here.
You gotta take care of her.

01:12:05.287 --> 01:12:08.563
She needs you right now
a whole lot more than I do.

01:12:09.927 --> 01:12:12.600
Besides, I think she kind of likes you.

01:12:14.127 --> 01:12:16.357
She does like me, doesn't she?

01:12:17.207 --> 01:12:20.836
Somebody's getting older.
Somebody's getting smarter.

01:12:23.407 --> 01:12:24.760
I'll see you, son.

01:12:26.927 --> 01:12:28.246
-Dad?
-Yes!

01:12:32.047 --> 01:12:33.526
Good luck.

01:12:39.127 --> 01:12:40.640
Good luck to you, too.

01:12:46.767 --> 01:12:48.200
Are you sure this is a good idea?

01:12:48.287 --> 01:12:52.166
I mean, I think we was pretty well situated
back at the campsite.

01:12:52.247 --> 01:12:54.715
Well, can you see the nest?

01:12:55.967 --> 01:13:00.438
No. But I can see the Sheriff.
Riley! Over here!

01:13:03.887 --> 01:13:06.276
I got this out of Sadie's freezer
to use as bait.

01:13:06.367 --> 01:13:08.676
The kids will be safe there.

01:13:08.767 --> 01:13:09.756
What the hell are you doing here?

01:13:09.847 --> 01:13:11.405
I thought I told you
to wait back at the camp.

01:13:11.487 --> 01:13:14.479
Well, Struthers was gonna get up
high enough to see the nest, but...

01:13:14.567 --> 01:13:17.684
Come on, Struthers, stop loafing.
Get up there.

01:13:21.087 --> 01:13:23.647
Come on, I got a plan.

01:13:23.727 --> 01:13:27.242
-Happy climbing, Struthers.
-He's got a plan.

01:13:27.327 --> 01:13:29.966
Well, I'm sure it's better than yours.

01:13:31.167 --> 01:13:34.443
A good Scout always has a Plan B.

01:13:34.527 --> 01:13:37.519
So, do you really think it's gonna eat
one of these things?

01:13:37.607 --> 01:13:39.086
It doesn't actually have to eat
one of these things.

01:13:39.167 --> 01:13:43.877
It just has to get close enough
so that I can ruin its day

01:13:43.967 --> 01:13:45.958
when I push this button.

01:13:48.087 --> 01:13:51.966
Besides, anything's better than hoping
Struthers gets off a good shot, right?

01:13:52.047 --> 01:13:53.036
Come on.

01:14:06.527 --> 01:14:07.846
Thank you.

01:14:08.247 --> 01:14:12.604
-I didn't know anybody lived out here.
-Yeah. Just me.

01:14:12.687 --> 01:14:17.078
But I get visitors from time to time.

01:14:17.167 --> 01:14:18.725
It must get lonely.

01:14:23.687 --> 01:14:25.245
Do you have any kids?

01:14:30.607 --> 01:14:32.245
You could say so.

01:14:35.287 --> 01:14:37.482
Two of them died recently.

01:14:42.407 --> 01:14:47.356
They were good boys.
I loved them a whole lot.

01:14:47.447 --> 01:14:49.836
Three of my friends died out there.

01:14:49.927 --> 01:14:53.602
They were eaten by these big,
ugly monsters.

01:14:55.647 --> 01:14:59.117
-Ugly? Is that so?
-Yeah.

01:15:00.167 --> 01:15:02.203
You should've seen them.

01:15:02.287 --> 01:15:06.565
Big, nasty creatures. They were vicious.

01:15:08.567 --> 01:15:11.161
Pretty young girls.

01:15:13.407 --> 01:15:15.716
Nothing, dear. Scott?

01:15:19.127 --> 01:15:22.915
-Will you do an old lady a favour?
-Sure.

01:15:33.847 --> 01:15:36.566
I don't like it out here.
I wanna go back inside.

01:15:36.647 --> 01:15:39.241
She's right. It's probably safer
inside your house, Mrs Bickerman.

01:15:39.327 --> 01:15:41.682
Okay. Don't be such wusses.

01:15:41.767 --> 01:15:46.443
I want to show Kerri something
and then we'll head back in.

01:15:48.207 --> 01:15:51.279
Look. Look. See?

01:15:51.367 --> 01:15:53.881
Those are white perch.

01:15:53.967 --> 01:15:58.438
-Excitable little things, aren't they?
-I don't really like fish.

01:15:58.527 --> 01:16:00.961
-I wanna go back inside now, okay?
-No, no, don't go. Just...

01:16:01.047 --> 01:16:03.117
-No, please! Let go of me!
-Wait for a minute. Wait. Wait.

01:16:03.207 --> 01:16:05.880
Let go of me! Let go!

01:16:09.807 --> 01:16:11.525
Help! Let go!

01:16:11.607 --> 01:16:13.120
Kerri, look out!

01:16:51.727 --> 01:16:53.240
There's four of them.

01:17:05.687 --> 01:17:07.996
I hate that rabbit.

01:17:23.087 --> 01:17:26.841
-The eggs are making a weird noise.
-No, no, I read about that.

01:17:26.927 --> 01:17:30.715
They chirp when they wanna
let the mother know they're about to hatch.

01:17:30.807 --> 01:17:33.605
Emma, the mama crocodile's
right over there.

01:17:33.687 --> 01:17:35.678
She's not gonna go to the nest.
She's gonna go right to the eggs.

01:17:35.767 --> 01:17:37.439
Get out of there!

01:17:47.247 --> 01:17:48.726
-Struthers, take a shot.
-I can't see.

01:17:48.807 --> 01:17:50.877
-Take a shot!
-I can't see!

01:17:56.247 --> 01:17:57.475
James!

01:17:57.567 --> 01:18:01.879
If I shoot with this I'm gonna blow
the whole place up. Take a damn shot!

01:18:05.727 --> 01:18:07.365
You are useless.

01:18:29.367 --> 01:18:31.756
Son of a bitch never had a chance!

01:18:31.847 --> 01:18:35.317
I guess you've got a head
for your wall now, huh, Emma?

01:18:52.607 --> 01:18:57.840
Well, look at that.
Emma and the Sheriff, K-l-S-S-l-N-G.

01:18:57.927 --> 01:19:00.999
How about me?
I'm swinging up here in the tree!

01:19:01.087 --> 01:19:02.315
Nice.

01:19:03.927 --> 01:19:07.078
Oh, well, isn't that beautiful?
What a picture they make.

01:19:14.847 --> 01:19:16.121
Wait here.

01:19:19.887 --> 01:19:21.684
Say good night, Gracie.

01:19:34.367 --> 01:19:35.516
Damn it, Scott, I thought I told you to stay...

01:19:35.607 --> 01:19:38.167
Bickerman lied about her crocs.
There's four of them.

01:19:38.247 --> 01:19:39.441
Four of them?

01:19:41.927 --> 01:19:45.636
If anything happens to me,
you make sure Emma gets out of here alive.

01:19:51.167 --> 01:19:52.395
Emma, get back.

01:19:52.487 --> 01:19:56.275
I'm gonna blow this thing
right into the middle of next week.

01:19:58.527 --> 01:20:00.518
After a while, crocodile.

01:20:12.527 --> 01:20:13.846
Dad, here!

01:21:04.927 --> 01:21:09.000
-Hey! We're here!
-Thank God.

01:21:17.247 --> 01:21:19.363
Scott, come here.

01:21:21.927 --> 01:21:24.395
Look, I'm gonna take Emma
and these eggs to the lab.

01:21:24.487 --> 01:21:27.445
-I'll probably be home pretty late.
-Okay.

01:21:27.527 --> 01:21:30.121
-I'm trusting you here.
-Okay. Okay.

01:21:42.727 --> 01:21:45.116
I hope all this didn't scare you out of town.

01:21:45.207 --> 01:21:49.041
Me? Nah, I'm still here for the summer.

01:21:49.127 --> 01:21:53.200
I'm not sure how much time I'm gonna be
spending down by the lake, though.

01:21:53.287 --> 01:21:54.720
Tell me about it.

01:21:54.807 --> 01:21:57.526
Boston College is looking
a lot more inviting now.

01:21:57.607 --> 01:22:01.839
Not too many crocodiles on those streets,
mostly just drunks.

01:22:01.927 --> 01:22:04.316
But don't worry, they don't bite.

01:22:08.927 --> 01:22:10.326
Daisy!

01:22:12.047 --> 01:22:17.041
-Good girl. Good girl.
-Wow, dog sure knows how to milk it.

01:22:17.127 --> 01:22:20.517
Apparently, I should have faked
my own death.

01:22:22.047 --> 01:22:24.641
-Scott.
-Kidding. Kidding.

01:22:54.847 --> 01:22:58.396
-So, how are our passengers doing?
-Oh, they seem to be fine.

01:22:58.487 --> 01:23:02.400
-Just watch the bumps.
-I'll watch the bumps.

01:23:04.847 --> 01:23:07.964
-How much further is this place?
-About two hours.

01:23:08.047 --> 01:23:11.119
We can stop in Bangor for dinner
if you want.

01:23:11.207 --> 01:23:12.196
Really?

01:23:13.607 --> 01:23:18.123
So, finally giving me a second
chance at another date, huh?

01:23:18.207 --> 01:23:20.767
-On one condition.
-What's that?

01:23:20.847 --> 01:23:23.600
No talking about ex-wives or crocodiles.

01:23:23.687 --> 01:23:25.917
-Deal?
-Deal.
