- Or maybe, in her mind,
she'd done that,

42:12.066 --> 42:13.066
so she's dealt with it.

42:13.100 --> 42:16.100
I don't know what goes on
in her mind.

42:16.133 --> 42:18.667
- I take two steps forward

42:18.700 --> 42:21.000
and ten back in our friendship.

42:21.033 --> 42:23.166
- I don't know
why she did that.

42:23.200 --> 42:27.300
That article is very,
very below the belt.

42:27.333 --> 42:28.700
- Well--

42:28.734 --> 42:30.200
- She's got some very
overzealous staff

42:30.233 --> 42:32.166
that believe that they're
acting in her best interest.

42:32.200 --> 42:34.300
And this is--
- No way, no way, no way.

42:34.333 --> 42:36.367
Nope, don't believe it
for one second.

42:36.400 --> 42:40.166
Lisa has full control
over her Vanderpuppets.

42:40.200 --> 42:41.700
- Well, you should
have it out with Lisa.

42:41.734 --> 42:44.066
You should say to Lisa,
"Why did you do this?"

42:44.100 --> 42:47.166
- This is a whole other layer
of betrayal.

42:47.200 --> 42:50.066
I do not even know
where to begin

42:50.100 --> 42:54.300
with my friendship
with this woman after this.

42:54.333 --> 42:55.433
You know what, PK?

42:55.467 --> 42:57.233
We'll see if she
gives me a call.

42:57.266 --> 43:00.400
- Lisa must know that
the truth is gonna come out.

43:00.433 --> 43:03.200
[dramatic music]

43:03.233 --> 43:06.166
- Next, on "The Real
Housewives of Beverly Hills":

43:06.200 --> 43:07.367
- Hey.
- Hi.

43:07.400 --> 43:10.066
So I'm with Lisa.
So what happened?

43:10.100 --> 43:12.166
- They passed.
all: Yeah!

43:12.200 --> 43:14.467
[women squealing]

43:14.500 --> 43:17.033
- Back that ass up.
Back up.

43:17.066 --> 43:19.300
- Oh, my God!
- Three, four!

43:19.333 --> 43:21.000
- I'm dying.

43:21.033 --> 43:23.433
- The mosquitoes can't get you,
but the bears can.

43:23.467 --> 43:25.367
- The bears can get you?
- Of course they can.

43:25.400 --> 43:28.166
- Well, why would you
do that then?

43:28.200 --> 43:29.734
- Have you ever known her
to leak stuff to the press?

43:29.767 --> 43:32.200
- I mean,
everybody here knows--

43:32.233 --> 43:33.467
- Kyle, answer the question.

43:33.500 --> 43:37.233
Have you ever known her
to leak stuff to the press?

43:37.266 --> 43:38.367
- I'm sorry.

43:39.567 --> 43:39.767
If I did something wrong,
that doesn't mean

43:40.533 --> 43:41.400
you wouldn't love me.

43:42.567 --> 43:43.133
- I am not going to say,
"Yes, I did something"

43:43.600 --> 43:44.700
if I didn't do it.

43:45.633 --> 43:46.333
- I didn't come here to fight.
- Okay.

43:47.700 --> 43:47.734
- I came here to tell you
this is the overall consensus--

43:49.133 --> 43:50.200
- No, you came here
to tell me I am a liar.

43:50.233 --> 43:51.467
- You're not her friend!

43:53.066 --> 43:54.033
- You cannot be her friend when
you say something like that.

43:54.667 --> 43:56.233
She would never say that
about you.

43:56.266 --> 43:57.700
- Get the (BLEEP)
out of my house!

43:57.734 --> 44:00.400
I swear to you,
I'm done with it.

44:02.266 --> 44:04.200
