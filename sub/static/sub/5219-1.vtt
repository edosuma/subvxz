41:32.380 --> 41:35.375
Not this time, Kray.

41:38.460 --> 41:40.271
The victim is very determined

41:40.760 --> 41:43.451
To testify against you.

41:43.540 --> 41:46.498
And there were a number
of witnesses tell us so.

41:47.540 --> 41:49.559
Is that was not enough.

41:50.620 --> 41:56.981
the banging host on the attack was
found in the back of the car you were in

41:58.100 --> 42:02.898
And you were found to be
in possession of a lamby gun

42:06.094 --> 42:13.286
In a word, Kray. You fact

42:16.700 --> 42:18.019
The fact kill you.

42:18.820 --> 42:20.892
Put him downstairs
 and lock him up.

42:51.260 --> 42:56.304
we found the offended guilty my lord

45:34.700 --> 45:37.524
Nice type of scotch

45:37.580 --> 45:41.017
It seems the bad begin

45:51.740 --> 45:53.570
Look at that.

45:55.960 --> 45:59.778
Here I can get used to real class.

46:01.660 --> 46:03.615
She is lovely.

46:04.700 --> 46:08.099
Do you see what we can
 achieve without hassles.

46:12.740 --> 46:14.415
Excuse me, Dickie.

46:30.140 --> 46:34.290
It went from bad to worse.
For Ron.

46:36.580 --> 46:40.572
The trouble started when he was
transferred for good behavior.

46:41.020 --> 46:44.199
After a while he start to behave strangely.

46:44.426 --> 46:48.029
Said that everyone had to have him.

46:50.140 --> 46:54.785
Ron.

46:55.468 --> 46:58.766
Would you come to the game room.

46:59.155 --> 47:03.155
It's not good to sit here alone.

48:14.140 --> 48:18.849
He burst into games room I went berserk

48:26.220 --> 48:32.361
He was transferred to a mental asylum
and they said he is not find in sane.

48:39.860 --> 48:41.737
I know how things stand, Reggie.

48:42.500 --> 48:44.718
I spoke to one of his doctors.

48:46.580 --> 48:48.899
Without medication,
 he's a time bomb.

48:49.140 --> 48:54.243
He is a danger to himself
and everyone around him

48:54.243 --> 48:59.802
And you will never move him into
the inevitable explosion anyone else

48:59.802 --> 49:03.972
get out now
while we still can

49:10.380 --> 49:15.309

51:49.940 --> 51:51.568
Hi, Reg. You wanted to see me?

51:57.620 --> 52:02.403
We need to arrange a meeting.
With the Italians and Maltese.

52:02.780 --> 52:05.694
Ingress of gambling
we can make a fortune

52:05.694 --> 52:09.136
Standing in a distance over
we should sit down and talk

52:09.480 --> 52:10.982
They feel solid nothing.

52:10.982 --> 52:12.375
The Italians are more easier

52:14.740 --> 52:16.573
What about the  street gangs?

52:16.573 --> 52:21.408
No chance. After what I've heard,
 to me spit in our face.

52:21.408 --> 52:24.710
Not after what we have
done with their club.

52:24.710 --> 52:29.707
I tell around.
I heard Ronnie quickly becomes free.

52:29.707 --> 52:31.970
Yes, we get it next week.

52:32.060 --> 52:34.181

52:34.181 --> 52:36.862

52:54.380 --> 52:55.940
Thank you for coming gentlemen.

52:55.940 --> 52:59.037
I know you're busy
So I get straight to the point

52:59.037 --> 53:04.113
The new gambling law
brings new opportunities for all of us

53:04.300 --> 53:05.938
There is more after around

53:06.020 --> 53:08.214
Why would we fight ever?

53:09.300 --> 53:12.131
It is wise now to
Find out what belongs to whom.

53:13.380 --> 53:18.200
Each from them runs at term off
Free from outside interference

53:18.940 --> 53:20.931
War is costly, gentlemen.

53:22.020 --> 53:23.817
And no one likes to waste money

53:24.900 --> 53:26.810
No one of you.

53:33.180 --> 53:34.694

53:34.780 --> 53:39.092
Let's go to the business.

53:42.567 --> 53:45.526

53:48.500 --> 53:52.627

53:55.170 --> 53:57.672

54:16.297 --> 54:19.630
How is the club?

54:19.630 --> 54:23.072

55:01.089 --> 55:03.750
Why do we talk to these wankers?

55:03.750 --> 55:06.211
We are not dealing with scum.

55:06.300 --> 55:08.417
We take what we want.

55:10.740 --> 55:14.033
Go on! Fuck up the lowers

55:17.060 --> 55:19.040
Ron

55:36.060 --> 55:40.090
He took his damn pills

55:46.060 --> 55:51.049
Excuse me, gentlemen. Dickie,

55:52.420 --> 55:56.107
Thanks for coming.

56:22.260 --> 56:25.599
What did they say?

56:25.599 --> 56:27.339
They said...

56:28.180 --> 56:33.410
They understand  Ron illness
And they stay in your plan.

56:34.340 --> 56:38.319
But...
-But what?

56:41.140 --> 56:44.815
So long Ron go in the shops

56:48.420 --> 56:52.379
It is funny just I am
It started already.

56:54.100 --> 56:56.453
What can I do?

56:57.540 --> 57:00.893
He's my brother

57:01.840 --> 57:04.058
Reg...
-What?

57:04.562 --> 57:07.379
Ther is more bad news.

57:08.140 --> 57:10.412
just  you call for Jackie Taylor

57:10.940 --> 57:14.768
He wants to have delivered Ron
at the tavern. Tonight.

57:21.283 --> 57:27.089
He wants Ronnie delivered?

57:27.683 --> 57:30.154
That's what he said.

57:30.154 --> 57:34.483
He said, " Be there or else..."

57:35.283 --> 57:37.970
We fucking will be there.

57:38.483 --> 57:41.792
And he is lucky if he
see a day again after we leave

57:45.963 --> 57:50.521
They saw peuple operate and Ronny was mad
and dragging Reggie with him

57:52.723 --> 57:57.793
Tell that to Jackie Taylor and the others
who were beaten that night

59:18.643 --> 59:21.433
Ron got something else that night.

59:21.443 --> 59:25.522
He got the whole Reg and
the family under his wing

59:25.883 --> 59:27.888
For a while, at least.

59:29.891 --> 59:35.302
The Twins emerge from the flight with the Walton
 Street is the undisputed bosses of East London

59:36.683 --> 59:39.402
Then they Thought east land
 to the west Land

59:39.883 --> 59:47.883
In addition, they had a lot of luck, when
businessman Leslie Payne was joint the firm

59:47.976 --> 59:54.161
As I've already told you Mr Payne
 I have no interest in selling my shares in the club

59:55.803 --> 59:58.200
Quite. I do understand.

59:59.683 --> 01:00:03.317
But you listen to my terms before you
dismiss my clients inquiry out of hand

01:00:04.403 --> 01:00:06.386
What are your clients terms Mr. Payne?

01:00:06.386 --> 01:00:09.903
One thousand pounds.
 In cash, of course.

01:00:10.883 --> 01:00:12.546
A thousand pounds.

01:00:12.763 --> 01:00:15.037
My shares are five times of that.

01:00:16.843 --> 01:00:19.346
Calm down you have some exaggeration

01:00:19.346 --> 01:00:20.682
No Mr. bloody well not

01:00:21.763 --> 01:00:25.791
Else to introduce me to sell my share
in a very successful gambling club

01:00:25.816 --> 01:00:31.928
frequented by extremely wealthy
clients for only one thousand pounds.

01:00:48.483 --> 01:00:52.639

01:01:25.243 --> 01:01:27.357
Congratulations, gentlemen.

01:01:27.357 --> 01:01:32.116
Now ,I suggest you out of the club
order a bottle of champagne

01:01:32.443 --> 01:01:35.399
And introduce the new owners
 to the management staff.

01:02:15.123 --> 01:02:18.504
That was straightforward enough
-Indeed.

01:02:18.903 --> 01:02:20.970
Cheers.

01:02:23.583 --> 01:02:28.175
May I have another 500?

-I do not care>

01:02:37.103 --> 01:02:38.936

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.960
This play is rediclouse

01:02:56.583 --> 01:02:58.110
What was that about?

01:02:58.110 --> 01:02:59.822
The customer exceeded his limit.

01:03:00.183 --> 01:03:04.355

Give it to him.

01:03:16.303 --> 01:03:19.530
With all respect Mr.
Kray,the success in this industry

01:03:19.561 --> 01:03:23.998
 is all about keeping
the bad debt to minimum

01:03:23.998 --> 01:03:28.832
Don't let me worry about that debt.
Gave him his five hundred.

01:03:28.983 --> 01:03:31.497

01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:39.583
The more mony they lose,
 the more mony we make.

01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:42.097
Yes, Mr. Kray.

01:03:42.183 --> 01:03:46.732
And enough now trouble
 to turn in bad debt

01:03:49.575 --> 01:03:51.366
Else the good one.

01:04:03.863 --> 01:04:05.547
Ronnie! please.

01:04:05.547 --> 01:04:08.543
Please Ronnie, no!

01:04:08.823 --> 01:04:13.894
Now where did you say you get
 your watch and jewelry bitch?

01:04:13.894 --> 01:04:16.871
So you sign the report
that we received earlier,

01:04:17.023 --> 01:04:23.298
That three men were suspend you
 by your legs from a flat window ?

01:04:23.483 --> 01:04:25.694
That must be mistaken

01:04:27.103 --> 01:04:28.822
All five of them?

01:04:29.303 --> 01:04:33.726
I have nothing more to say
now,  please may I leave?

01:04:43.703 --> 01:04:46.885
I'm sorry, Reggie.

01:04:46.943 --> 01:04:49.298

01:04:58.903 --> 01:05:01.894
So I want  you marry me?

01:05:02.483 --> 01:05:06.713
I'm only 19. I'm
not ready for marriage and children.

01:05:07.463 --> 01:05:10.616
And then my mom and dad

01:05:10.663 --> 01:05:14.343
What about your mom and dad?

01:05:14.983 --> 01:05:19.259
They want  rid of the relationship.
-Why?

01:05:19.259 --> 01:05:23.645
I do not know.
Your own business ..

01:05:23.645 --> 01:05:24.789
What's wrong with you?

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:28.121
It is cookie for staff ,
and you rub frequently people

01:05:28.121 --> 01:05:31.151
 beat them up and
steal their money ..

01:05:33.651 --> 01:05:36.027
They said you felon.

01:05:36.343 --> 01:05:38.856
It is  better for women
waiting for knock on the door

01:05:39.143 --> 01:05:43.742
than tell your husband arrant or worse

01:05:43.983 --> 01:05:46.496
I have to marry someone
 with proper job.

01:05:47.223 --> 01:05:50.137

Looking for bad on head

01:09:17.363 --> 01:09:19.513
you should try hanging the cat instead

01:09:20.162 --> 01:09:22.444
Then you might show more interest.

01:09:22.444 --> 01:09:25.091
Don't fucking talk about Frances likt that

01:09:25.091 --> 01:09:27.078

Frances, the more Ronnie fell

01:10:12.979 --> 01:10:17.826

Not so late, Teddy.

01:21:44.563 --> 01:21:46.758
Look at all these important men.

01:21:46.843 --> 01:21:48.162
With their dirty little secrets.

01:21:51.683 --> 01:21:54.338
and their silly bargains

01:21:54.963 --> 01:21:58.712
I wonder what would happen,
as their secrets came out.

01:21:59.603 --> 01:22:01.546
Imagine the scandal.

01:22:01.546 --> 01:22:08.065

offensive against the Krays!

01:22:55.845 --> 01:22:58.900

With the suggestion of a blackmail

01:23:29.043 --> 01:23:32.699
Before you answer why would you
 find out if it is allegations is true

01:23:32.723 --> 01:23:34.283
It could bring down the government

01:23:34.283 --> 01:23:37.017
And undermined the political
establishment for the years to come

01:23:40.403 --> 01:23:44.506
Joe, we need the right
 anser from you on this one.

01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:49.563
what I can say this, that Scotland Yard

01:23:49.563 --> 01:23:54.925
is categorically not undertake an investigation
 into organized crime in the capital

01:23:55.403 --> 01:23:59.675
In fact if you ask I can
go in a the records

01:23:59.675 --> 01:24:01.780
to see if the organized crime in
London is into the climb

01:24:05.083 --> 01:24:09.962

After the perfume affair,we hold
the morale high ground.

01:25:23.227 --> 01:25:25.877
I have not the intention of losing

01:28:35.163 --> 01:28:37.721

The case of the twins fell apart
as witnesses has changed sides

01:29:54.222 --> 01:29:57.484
and certain members of the jury
 couldn't agree on the verdict.

01:29:57.643 --> 01:30:02.152
