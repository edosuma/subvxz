<b>The Fly II 
English Subtitles</b>

00:43.335 --> 00:45.796
There's something
wrong. I can feel it.

00:46.296 --> 00:49.383
Now, stop screaming, take
a deep breath and...

00:51.677 --> 00:55.097
Something's wrong, goddamn
it. Do something! Help her!

00:55.305 --> 00:59.351
You're too excitable, Mr. borans.
Take him somewhere to calm down.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.521
Screaming will not
help anyone now.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.275
Steady.

01:06.733 --> 01:07.943
Hold her steady.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.865
- Why wasn't I notified sooner?
- Sorry, Mr. bartok.

01:13.115 --> 01:14.700
We called when labor began.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.493
Oh, my god!

01:17.369 --> 01:19.621
Just get it out of me!

01:20.122 --> 01:22.332
Come on! Get it out of me!

01:22.541 --> 01:27.045
No! Just get it out
of me! Get it out!

01:27.963 --> 01:32.676
You said it wasn't gonna be
like this! You promised!

01:33.844 --> 01:35.637
Push, Ronnie. It's coming.

01:35.846 --> 01:37.973
Push, push.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.101
Jesus.

01:55.616 --> 01:58.243
Cut the umbilical
cord get the pitocin.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.219
We're losing her.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.098
Clear.

02:24.311 --> 02:25.395
All clear.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.151
Is there something
moving in here?

02:32.569 --> 02:35.113
Charge. All clear.

02:41.662 --> 02:42.955
Doctor.

02:43.539 --> 02:45.165
She's gone.

04:55.337 --> 04:59.925
Dr. jainway, do not think this
child is a laboratory animal.

05:00.467 --> 05:03.929
I want you to take care of him
as though he were my very own.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.431
You will all answer
to Dr. jainway.

05:07.099 --> 05:09.226
She, in turn, will answer to me.

05:09.434 --> 05:14.231
I, in turn, will answer
to nobody but god.

05:15.357 --> 05:19.444
From god's mouth to your ears,
that is the chain of command.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.738
Is that understood?

05:23.782 --> 05:27.160
Here we have an average
11-month-old child.

05:29.538 --> 05:32.791
And here we have our
11-month-old child.

05:34.251 --> 05:37.796
As you can see, his life cycle
is dramatically accelerated.

05:38.422 --> 05:41.550
Now, these are
aberrant chromosomes.

05:41.758 --> 05:44.469
Obviously a product
of genetic mutation.

05:44.720 --> 05:48.849
These are all dormant, something
in addition to accelerated growth.

05:49.766 --> 05:54.313
And his non-genetic characteristics?
His learning abilities, for example.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.190
He's got a photographic memory.

05:56.398 --> 05:59.318
He doesn't just learn,
he consumes information.

05:59.985 --> 06:02.529
And he never sleeps.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.281
Is that so?

06:05.407 --> 06:06.992
Do you like him?

06:09.578 --> 06:14.291
Well, as a clinical subject,
I find him astonishing.

06:15.501 --> 06:19.254
But he does try our Patience when
it comes to medical examinations.

06:19.755 --> 06:23.258
I think it's time our young
guest and I became acquainted.

06:42.236 --> 06:44.404
We're not interrupting, are we?

06:44.613 --> 06:46.657
Not at all, Mr. bartok.

06:48.951 --> 06:52.287
What a handsome young man you
are. Do you know who I am?

06:52.538 --> 06:56.250
Yes, you're one of the people
who lives behind the mirror.

06:57.125 --> 07:00.003
Well, my name is Mr. bartok.

07:00.587 --> 07:03.131
I'd like you to think
of me as your dad.

07:03.465 --> 07:04.967
Martin...

07:07.094 --> 07:09.137
what's that behind your ear?

07:15.352 --> 07:19.648
You know, it's knowing the right
magic word that makes it happen.

07:19.857 --> 07:23.861
It's a real magic word, a secret
word that you keep locked away...

07:24.111 --> 07:28.782
inside your heart and
you never tell anybody.

07:28.991 --> 07:32.911
No, you don't tell anybody, and
that's what makes the magic work.

07:37.291 --> 07:38.542
Martin.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.670
Martin, are you listening to me?

07:42.671 --> 07:44.381
Dr. Shepard...

07:45.382 --> 07:48.635
I don't mean to be
rude by not facing you.

07:48.844 --> 07:53.557
But those tests are far too simple
to demand my full attention.

07:54.433 --> 07:57.060
Besides, I'm almost finished.

07:57.269 --> 07:59.188
So am I, Martin.

07:59.980 --> 08:04.860
I just have to time you on this maze,
and we can both do something we enjoy.

08:23.754 --> 08:25.881
Very impressive, Martin.

08:35.224 --> 08:37.601
<i>People, may I have
your attention?</i>

08:37.851 --> 08:41.355
<i>I've grown tired of
your trivial influence.</i>

08:41.605 --> 08:45.192
<i>Another outburst and I'll be
forced to make an example of you.</i>

08:45.400 --> 08:46.985
You've outdone yourself.

08:47.236 --> 08:48.737
But what else does it do?

08:57.829 --> 09:00.415
Keep still, Martin.
Stop fidgeting.

09:00.666 --> 09:02.793
Is Mr. bartok gonna visit today?

09:03.001 --> 09:06.380
You know how busy he is. He has
that project in zone four.

09:06.588 --> 09:08.006
Oh, yeah.

09:08.966 --> 09:10.092
Can I go visit him?

09:10.300 --> 09:13.720
- Of course not, you're not allowed.
- Why?

09:13.971 --> 09:16.431
Because you don't have
zone four clearance.

09:16.849 --> 09:19.768
How much longer do I have
to take these shots for?

09:20.686 --> 09:22.896
As long as you would
like to live.

09:25.983 --> 09:27.484
Why don't I have clearance?

09:27.693 --> 09:31.196
Because you're only a zone three
project. You're fidgeting.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.365
It's normal behavior.

09:33.615 --> 09:36.743
I read it in a book for
mothers. Want to see?

09:38.829 --> 09:39.955
No, thank you.

09:41.039 --> 09:44.918
Now, sit still or Mr. bartok will
be very disappointed in you.

13:20.217 --> 13:24.221
You know, I got this disease...

13:24.471 --> 13:28.892
so rare, there's only been
two people who've ever had it.

13:29.685 --> 13:31.186
My father.

13:31.687 --> 13:33.272
And now me.

13:34.898 --> 13:37.234
They even named it after him.

13:38.318 --> 13:42.030
It's called brundle's
accelerated growth syndrome.

13:44.199 --> 13:49.329
The doctors say it means I'm growing
up a lot faster than I'm supposed to.

13:49.621 --> 13:52.249
Which isn't so bad, I guess.

13:53.750 --> 13:58.088
But I think it also means that
I'm gonna die a lot sooner.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.633
Which isn't so great.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.993
<i>Today is your lucky day, Martin.</i>

14:28.202 --> 14:31.246
<i>Lamb chops and French fries.
Your favorite, isn't it?</i>

14:31.455 --> 14:33.123
Yes, sir.

16:47.132 --> 16:49.218
Initiate sequence, please.

17:18.997 --> 17:20.374
It's okay.

17:53.198 --> 17:55.701
It worked! He's moving around.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.537
He's still alive!

18:06.128 --> 18:08.338
How the hell did he get in here?

18:08.547 --> 18:10.007
What's wrong?

18:37.534 --> 18:39.953
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you, everybody.

18:40.204 --> 18:43.790
Blow out the candles. don't
forget to make a wish.

18:51.006 --> 18:53.300
Martin, the whole team
wants you to know...

18:53.550 --> 18:56.345
how happy we are to
share your fifth birthday.

18:56.595 --> 18:57.721
What's your wish?

18:59.765 --> 19:01.058
You know what I want?

19:02.017 --> 19:03.602
Your privacy.

19:04.436 --> 19:06.730
And I think it's about
time you got it.

19:09.608 --> 19:11.735
Say the magic word...

19:12.736 --> 19:15.072
and make the mirror disappear.

19:26.708 --> 19:30.963
- I don't think I should go too far...
- Nonsense, it's a beautiful day.

19:31.171 --> 19:34.508
Fresh air will do you good. You
should get out more often.

19:50.607 --> 19:53.026
You mean, this is mine?

19:54.319 --> 19:55.571
This is my place?

19:55.821 --> 19:57.281
Your place.

19:57.656 --> 19:59.074
Your private place.

19:59.324 --> 20:02.369
No more mirrors, no
more prying eyes.

20:26.059 --> 20:27.227
Wow.

20:28.854 --> 20:30.147
Whee!

20:33.150 --> 20:34.401
So do you like it?

20:36.987 --> 20:38.197
Yes.

20:38.405 --> 20:42.326
I know it hasn't been easy growing
up in such a clinical environment.

20:42.534 --> 20:45.621
Due to your unique affliction,
it's been unavoidable.

20:45.829 --> 20:47.456
You've been very good to me.

20:48.165 --> 20:49.958
I don't know how to thank you.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.669
Perhaps I can think
of something.

20:53.921 --> 20:57.925
I'd like you to consider taking a
position here at bartok industries.

20:58.133 --> 21:00.636
- Position?
- Something challenging.

21:00.886 --> 21:03.055
To keep you from being bored.

21:03.263 --> 21:07.267
A match for your intellect,
your creative mind.

21:08.352 --> 21:09.811
I'm talking about a job.

21:28.831 --> 21:31.458
Five years and millions
of dollars later...

21:31.667 --> 21:33.544
and what we have is...

21:34.378 --> 21:38.507
What we have is the
world's most expensive...

21:41.093 --> 21:42.302
juicer.

21:43.220 --> 21:46.265
The greatest invention in
the history of mankind...

21:46.515 --> 21:49.393
and we can't get the
damn thing to work.

21:50.102 --> 21:54.106
We're like chimpanzees trying to
figure out how to operate a car.

21:56.024 --> 21:58.151
Your father was a brilliant man.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.946
Brilliant, but erratic.

22:01.154 --> 22:04.283
When he died, some of his
secrets died with him.

22:08.370 --> 22:10.581
You could finish
your father's work.

22:11.039 --> 22:14.209
You're as brilliant as he
was, perhaps even more so.

22:14.459 --> 22:16.336
I don't like these things.

22:16.545 --> 22:18.589
It's because of the
dog, isn't it?

22:19.548 --> 22:21.925
How long will you
hold that against me?

22:22.217 --> 22:25.596
It was a tragic mistake, but
that's in the past now.

22:25.804 --> 22:27.890
You must concentrate
on the future.

22:28.098 --> 22:30.559
The future is right
here in this very room.

22:30.976 --> 22:35.564
Imagine a new era of
surgery without incision.

22:35.772 --> 22:38.901
Cutting people would be
primitive, a thing of the past.

22:39.109 --> 22:42.196
All the things that would
become obsolete overnight.

22:42.446 --> 22:44.907
That's what these
machines represent.

22:45.115 --> 22:47.117
A new age.

22:55.584 --> 22:57.377
If you want personnel...

22:57.586 --> 23:00.380
Dr. trimble and his
people are at your disposal.

23:00.589 --> 23:04.468
If you want to work alone,
fine. It's your choice.

23:10.807 --> 23:12.184
Martin...

23:13.936 --> 23:16.563
we did everything
we could for your dog.

23:17.439 --> 23:21.360
Take comfort in knowing
he didn't suffer long.

23:22.903 --> 23:24.696
And one more thing.

23:25.322 --> 23:29.284
Your father kept a
record of his progress.

23:31.119 --> 23:33.038
Before you decide...

23:34.581 --> 23:36.583
listen to your father.

23:48.303 --> 23:51.890
<i>We've just seen the first
teleportation of a human being.</i>

23:52.099 --> 23:56.186
<i>Dr. Seth brundle, how did
it feel going through?</i>

23:56.770 --> 23:59.731
<i>It felt like a stutter.</i>

23:59.982 --> 24:01.400
<i>A what?</i>

24:02.943 --> 24:04.987
<i>A stutter, you know, a hiccup.</i>

24:05.237 --> 24:08.282
<i>A slight dislocation
of my physical life.</i>

24:08.490 --> 24:11.618
<i>Not unpleasant, just a little
interruption of rhythm.</i>

24:11.910 --> 24:16.206
<i>At first I thought it didn't work. I
thought I was in the same telepod.</i>

24:16.456 --> 24:18.709
<i>And now, how do you feel?</i>

24:19.334 --> 24:21.670
<i>I should feel exactly
the same as before...</i>

24:21.920 --> 24:24.548
<i>but I don 't.
I feel very...</i>

24:25.674 --> 24:28.093
<i>energized, very coordinated.</i>

24:28.302 --> 24:31.263
<i>I feel as though I work
better physically, you know?</i>

24:31.513 --> 24:36.643
<i>Everything seems to just work
better than it ever did before.</i>

24:36.852 --> 24:38.520
<i>Why should that be?</i>

24:41.148 --> 24:43.525
<i>I don 't know. It's
possible that...</i>

24:44.610 --> 24:48.113
<i>the teleporter
somehow improved me.</i>

24:48.488 --> 24:51.950
<i>In reassembling me, it might have
seen where things could be...</i>

24:52.159 --> 24:55.037
<i>improved theoretically,
and it did it.</i>

24:55.287 --> 24:59.583
<i>I told it to be creative,
and maybe it has been.</i>

26:07.568 --> 26:09.236
<i>How can I help you?</i>

26:11.989 --> 26:15.409
Do you have any organic
matter that I can borrow?

26:15.659 --> 26:16.702
<i>Excuse me?</i>

26:16.910 --> 26:19.746
A potato, a plant,
something living.

26:19.955 --> 26:24.084
<i>You'll have to speak to maintenance,
and they won 't be in until 8:00 A.M.</i>

26:24.501 --> 26:25.919
Eight?

26:27.045 --> 26:28.630
Well, thanks anyway.

26:36.138 --> 26:38.015
Hey, got a visitor.

26:38.265 --> 26:41.643
It's bartok's brat. That
kid gets away with murder.

26:41.852 --> 26:44.897
Don't worry, he'll
get his someday.

27:26.355 --> 27:27.940
Nice catch.

27:33.654 --> 27:35.155
What is this?

27:35.447 --> 27:36.824
A fly.

27:38.158 --> 27:40.369
An artificial fly for fishing.

27:41.578 --> 27:43.497
I guess you don't fish.

27:44.790 --> 27:46.625
I don't get out much.

27:48.752 --> 27:50.921
I'd go crazy without
some diversion.

27:51.171 --> 27:53.507
Crt burnout till
3:00 in the morning.

27:53.715 --> 27:56.009
I heard bartok was
good for advancement.

27:56.260 --> 27:59.471
I've been here six months, and
I'm still computer filing.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.390
Graveyard shift, no less.

28:03.267 --> 28:04.601
Are you new here?

28:04.810 --> 28:06.770
I've been here five years.

28:07.020 --> 28:09.189
Five years and you
still work nights?

28:09.398 --> 28:11.233
I work days too.

28:11.608 --> 28:13.110
When do you sleep?

28:13.569 --> 28:14.611
I don't.

28:16.822 --> 28:17.948
You don't?

28:23.287 --> 28:25.205
I got that in California.

28:26.957 --> 28:28.750
So what are you working on?

28:29.585 --> 28:32.713
The most important invention
in the history of mankind.

28:33.755 --> 28:35.549
With my cactus?

28:36.091 --> 28:37.301
Yes.

28:39.052 --> 28:41.388
I'm talking change
beyond imagination.

28:41.597 --> 28:44.725
The big leap from stone
age to microtechnologies.

28:47.519 --> 28:50.981
Would you like to come up to
my lab and watch, Beth Logan?

28:56.778 --> 28:59.239
I have to give you
points for originality.

29:02.367 --> 29:03.952
You don't believe me?

29:04.453 --> 29:07.915
Look, don't take this
personally, but...

29:10.959 --> 29:12.336
Should I?

29:12.836 --> 29:16.089
I love living on a houseboat.
It's peaceful on the water.

29:16.298 --> 29:19.343
- Houseboat?
- Hey, wait a minute, Martin.

29:19.593 --> 29:23.805
I can't go any further. I don't
have any clearance for this sector.

29:24.431 --> 29:26.934
Poof! You have clearance.

29:45.953 --> 29:47.162
Wait.

29:48.372 --> 29:50.457
What did you just do?

29:50.999 --> 29:53.836
I've broken down the cactus's
molecular structure...

29:54.044 --> 29:56.755
and teleported it from
one pod to the other.

29:57.214 --> 29:58.423
And...

30:25.200 --> 30:26.493
What's that?

30:28.745 --> 30:31.290
It wasn't supposed to do this.

30:31.540 --> 30:33.041
Something...

30:35.419 --> 30:36.795
I'm sorry.

30:38.338 --> 30:39.673
You keep it.

30:47.848 --> 30:50.350
I have to get back
to work anyway.

30:51.685 --> 30:55.564
But I enjoyed meeting
you, Martin brundle.

30:59.693 --> 31:03.071
Maybe you should beta
test the program.

31:17.419 --> 31:18.712
Beth...

31:22.132 --> 31:24.343
would you like
to visit me again?

31:26.678 --> 31:29.264
- I don't want to disturb you.
- You wouldn't.

31:30.557 --> 31:35.229
You see, I have no friends here,
only acquaintances, and...

31:38.440 --> 31:40.400
I would like us to be friends.

31:42.402 --> 31:45.322
- Is that possible?
- I'd like that.

31:47.491 --> 31:48.534
I, um...

31:48.742 --> 31:51.787
I get a dinner break
every night at 10:00.

31:52.955 --> 31:54.081
Great.

31:54.706 --> 31:59.461
Why don't you come down here? If you
like, you can help with the telepods.

31:59.670 --> 32:00.670
Okay.

32:04.258 --> 32:07.010
Maybe we could fix my plant.

32:09.680 --> 32:11.181
Hey, Marty?

32:12.933 --> 32:16.395
What's the good word? Got
yourself a girlfriend now?

32:16.854 --> 32:17.855
No.

32:19.356 --> 32:20.774
Too bad.

32:21.024 --> 32:22.651
Nice ass.

32:29.158 --> 32:32.369
Last night, I slept
for two hours.

32:32.619 --> 32:33.787
The longest I've ever slept.

32:34.037 --> 32:36.456
I'm not willing to attach
any significance to it.

32:36.707 --> 32:40.419
Why not? It means I'm slowing down,
stabilizing, becoming normal.

32:40.627 --> 32:43.839
It doesn't necessarily follow.
You're just working too hard.

32:44.089 --> 32:48.093
If you were undergoing a metabolic
change we would have found it by now.

32:48.719 --> 32:50.596
You're missing my vein.

32:53.390 --> 32:56.018
That's what you get for
not sitting still!

33:04.401 --> 33:06.236
Now let's try it again.

33:07.029 --> 33:08.739
I don't think so.

34:54.178 --> 34:57.931
A friend of mine in specimens
division asked me up there tomorrow.

34:58.182 --> 35:01.560
They're having sort of
an office get-together.

35:03.770 --> 35:04.980
Do you want to come?

35:06.607 --> 35:08.442
Will there be people there?

35:09.902 --> 35:12.654
Yeah, there usually
are at get-togethers.

35:12.863 --> 35:14.490
But nice people.

35:14.865 --> 35:16.783
You'd be surprised.

35:18.494 --> 35:20.329
- Yeah?
- Yes.

35:25.751 --> 35:28.462
So that's your genius.

35:29.505 --> 35:31.590
He is cute.

35:31.882 --> 35:34.426
I told you, but he's shy.

35:34.635 --> 35:36.803
I hope he's enjoying himself.

35:54.446 --> 35:57.282
I've never seen anything
like it before in my life.

35:57.533 --> 35:58.533
What is it?

35:58.617 --> 36:00.619
We don't make them,
we keep them alive.

36:00.828 --> 36:01.828
It's so ugly.

36:01.870 --> 36:05.999
He's our pride and joy in specimens.
Our longest running engagement.

36:06.208 --> 36:07.251
Two years.

36:07.501 --> 36:09.545
That's been alive for two years?

36:09.795 --> 36:13.507
We call him Timex. "Takes a
licking, keeps on ticking."

36:17.761 --> 36:18.929
Hi.

36:19.596 --> 36:20.639
Hi.

37:54.233 --> 37:55.484
Leave me alone.

38:01.698 --> 38:02.783
Martin!

38:04.785 --> 38:07.621
- Martin, what's the matter?
- I said to leave me alone, Beth.

38:07.830 --> 38:10.707
Talk to me. I thought
we were friends.

38:11.291 --> 38:13.502
- I didn't know...
- Stay out of my sector!

38:13.752 --> 38:15.712
You no longer have clearance.

41:59.728 --> 42:01.146
Martin.

42:02.648 --> 42:07.486
There was an unfortunate incident in
the specimens division last night.

42:07.694 --> 42:09.780
Someone broke in and
caused some damage.

42:10.030 --> 42:12.866
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

42:17.996 --> 42:18.996
No.

42:20.958 --> 42:22.417
He's lying.

42:22.835 --> 42:24.920
Of course, he's lying.

42:26.672 --> 42:29.550
It seems our Martin
is growing up.

43:17.514 --> 43:18.932
Hi.

43:19.808 --> 43:21.226
Hi.

43:23.270 --> 43:24.563
I'm sorry.

43:25.814 --> 43:27.483
Don't be sorry.

43:30.861 --> 43:32.070
I missed you.

43:32.279 --> 43:33.279
You did?

43:37.910 --> 43:38.952
Really?

43:46.793 --> 43:49.171
Come here, I want to
show you something.

43:54.134 --> 43:56.053
Okay, close your eyes.

44:01.558 --> 44:02.726
Ta-da!

44:03.894 --> 44:06.438
Oh, gosh. Look at it.

44:06.730 --> 44:08.148
Yes.

44:11.944 --> 44:12.945
Come here.

44:13.987 --> 44:15.447
Where you going?

44:17.324 --> 44:19.201
Martin, what are you doing?

44:20.285 --> 44:21.662
You can't do that.

44:23.914 --> 44:25.249
It's all right.

44:26.083 --> 44:27.668
Initiate the sequence.

44:27.876 --> 44:30.295
No, I can't.

44:32.005 --> 44:33.298
Martin.

44:36.260 --> 44:37.553
Trust me.

45:15.424 --> 45:16.758
Hi.

45:18.969 --> 45:21.138
That's wonderful. How
did you do this?

45:21.346 --> 45:22.764
I started from scratch.

45:23.265 --> 45:27.477
Trimble and the rest asked the wrong
questions, made the same mistakes.

45:27.728 --> 45:30.939
They were too close to the
problem to see it clearly.

45:31.482 --> 45:33.650
Scientific myopia.

45:34.818 --> 45:38.864
They thought of it in terms
of methodology, of physics.

45:40.115 --> 45:41.992
Absolutes.

45:45.078 --> 45:49.291
But you have to be able to
open your eyes and admire...

45:49.958 --> 45:53.253
the beauty of the process.

46:43.595 --> 46:44.763
Martin.

46:49.059 --> 46:50.394
What?

46:50.811 --> 46:51.811
What is this?

46:56.859 --> 46:58.443
Just a little accident.

46:58.861 --> 47:01.029
Well, it's getting all infected.

47:01.321 --> 47:03.115
You'd better have it looked at.

47:05.909 --> 47:07.452
I have to go now.

48:50.097 --> 48:52.391
It's just an infection.
This antibiotic...

48:52.641 --> 48:54.560
don't patronize me, Shepard!

48:54.768 --> 48:57.187
This is obviously
not an infection.

48:57.437 --> 49:00.732
What's going to happen?
Will I lose my arm?

49:00.983 --> 49:05.529
Of course not. Now this injection
will clear it up right away.

49:06.572 --> 49:08.407
You're going to
have to trust me.

49:08.615 --> 49:10.868
<i>I don 't trust you. I
want to see Mr. bartok.</i>

49:11.118 --> 49:13.245
- There's no doubt.
None at all.

49:13.495 --> 49:17.416
Early stages of genetic metamorphosis
have been showing up on tests.

49:17.666 --> 49:19.918
His aberrant chromosomes
are not dormant.

49:20.169 --> 49:22.921
Now that he's reached full
maturity, they're growing...

49:23.172 --> 49:25.465
changing, becoming more defined.

49:25.716 --> 49:26.717
How fast?

49:26.967 --> 49:28.969
Like wild fire.

49:29.303 --> 49:32.139
You know what to do, what
preparations to make.

49:32.389 --> 49:33.891
Get on with it.

49:44.109 --> 49:46.612
You having a problem, Ms. Logan?

49:51.450 --> 49:53.994
My card isn't working,
it's not opening the door.

49:54.244 --> 49:58.081
Nothing wrong with your card.
It's just not your door anymore.

49:58.749 --> 50:01.418
- What're you talking about?
- It looks like...

50:01.668 --> 50:04.546
your transfer to the day
shift finally came through.

50:04.796 --> 50:06.632
Just like you wanted.

50:10.010 --> 50:12.471
Systems analysis?

50:13.138 --> 50:15.807
This is in a building
across town.

50:16.475 --> 50:19.144
We've already sent your
personal effects over.

50:20.354 --> 50:23.941
That's what you get for fucking
around with bartok's pet freak.

50:24.608 --> 50:26.235
For your eyes only.

50:32.574 --> 50:34.159
Bye-bye.

50:41.375 --> 50:42.709
<i>May I help you?</i>

50:42.960 --> 50:45.337
Yes, I'd like an
outside line, please.

50:45.587 --> 50:49.591
<i>I'm sorry, sir, all outside lines
are busy. Please try again later.</i>

50:50.592 --> 50:51.885
Thank you.

50:56.765 --> 50:58.767
<i>Bartok industries,
may I help you?</i>

50:58.976 --> 51:01.061
I'd like to speak
with Martin brundle.

51:01.270 --> 51:04.398
<i>There is no Martin brundle
here. Please try again.</i>

51:04.648 --> 51:07.317
Now, you listen
to me. I know...

51:22.249 --> 51:23.917
<i>- Beth?
- Martin?</i>

51:24.168 --> 51:25.794
<i>- You all right?
- Oh, my god!</i>

51:26.003 --> 51:28.255
I've been trying to
call you. You okay?

51:28.463 --> 51:31.133
Something is happening to
me. I don't know what.

51:32.342 --> 51:35.762
I was transferred. They found
out. Bartok knows about us.

51:35.971 --> 51:37.139
We never told anyone.

51:37.389 --> 51:40.017
Because he saw us. He
videotaped us in bed.

52:49.837 --> 52:51.380
That's it.

52:52.840 --> 52:54.091
He's found it.

52:55.133 --> 52:58.470
You'd better call bartok,
tell him the kid's pissed.

53:10.107 --> 53:11.107
I see.

53:11.150 --> 53:12.860
We lost video completely.

53:13.068 --> 53:15.571
<i>Where is he now?
- Could be anywhere.</i>

53:18.323 --> 53:20.159
You're not allowed in here.

53:20.784 --> 53:21.784
Get out!

53:50.522 --> 53:52.649
<i>You don 't know
anything. I was there.</i>

53:52.858 --> 53:56.653
<i>I upset brundle. He was trying to
cure himself, can 't you see that?</i>

53:57.154 --> 54:00.199
<i>You gotta help Ronnie, she's
pregnant with his child.</i>

54:02.743 --> 54:05.996
<i>You and I are gonna be very
good friends, you think?</i>

54:07.664 --> 54:09.249
<i>Well, I know we are.</i>

54:09.500 --> 54:10.667
<i>I want us to...</i>

54:10.876 --> 54:15.923
<i>I want us to be more than friends. I
want you to think of me as your dad.</i>

54:20.010 --> 54:22.012
<i>You mean this is my place?</i>

54:22.721 --> 54:26.016
<i>Your place, your private place.</i>

54:26.308 --> 54:29.812
<i>No more mirrors, no
more prying eyes.</i>

54:30.896 --> 54:32.731
<i>Go on, take a look.</i>

54:52.584 --> 54:54.211
<i>A fly...</i>

54:54.920 --> 54:56.505
<i>got into that...</i>

54:57.130 --> 55:00.050
<i>transmitter pod with
me that first time.</i>

55:00.384 --> 55:02.219
<i>The computer got confused.</i>

55:02.469 --> 55:05.681
<i>There weren't supposed to be
two separate genetic patterns.</i>

55:05.889 --> 55:08.183
<i>And then decided to...</i>

55:08.934 --> 55:10.227
<i>splice us together.</i>

55:10.727 --> 55:12.771
<i>It mated us, me and the fly.</i>

55:17.734 --> 55:19.444
Now you know.

55:21.989 --> 55:26.535
A rather rude awakening, but at
least we can drop all pretense now.

55:29.204 --> 55:30.330
Martin...

55:32.374 --> 55:34.042
you will soon become...

55:34.293 --> 55:38.213
the most unique living creature
on the face of the earth.

55:38.755 --> 55:39.882
No, I won't.

55:40.132 --> 55:44.344
There's nothing you or I, or
anyone can do to stop it.

55:45.304 --> 55:46.763
I'll take my...

55:47.014 --> 55:49.266
medications, my injections.

55:49.516 --> 55:50.934
They're merely water...

55:51.810 --> 55:53.228
placebo.

55:53.812 --> 55:57.191
We had to give you some
sense of hope, otherwise...

56:01.445 --> 56:02.613
You...

56:03.614 --> 56:04.698
You...

56:05.073 --> 56:06.366
want this to happen?

56:06.617 --> 56:08.869
Of course, I want it to happen.

56:10.579 --> 56:12.414
You're the prototype...

56:12.664 --> 56:15.918
for a whole new age of
biological exploration.

56:16.126 --> 56:17.753
With you as the model...

56:18.003 --> 56:20.130
and the telepods as the tool...

56:20.380 --> 56:22.216
bartok industry...

56:22.674 --> 56:26.386
will control the form and
function of all life on earth.

56:28.722 --> 56:30.974
Calmly, Martin.

56:31.225 --> 56:32.684
Accept it.

56:33.852 --> 56:37.856
This was planned from
the day you were born.

56:38.106 --> 56:42.027
We'll do everything we can to make
it as painless as possible for you.

56:49.493 --> 56:51.203
I loved you.

56:57.292 --> 56:58.710
Get scorby.

56:59.419 --> 57:02.881
<i>Scorby, report to the main
station. We have a situation.</i>

57:03.131 --> 57:04.383
Come back!

57:25.737 --> 57:27.698
You guys, stay here.

57:34.580 --> 57:35.998
You want out?

57:36.498 --> 57:38.667
You have to go
through me, Marty.

57:52.222 --> 57:55.350
I enjoyed that tape of
you and your girlfriend.

57:56.268 --> 57:59.188
Girl goes like a
jackhammer, doesn't she?

58:26.882 --> 58:28.717
I don't want excuses.

58:28.967 --> 58:31.929
I want him back. Is
that understood?

58:32.721 --> 58:33.805
Yes, sir.

58:43.315 --> 58:45.275
Are you ready for
me, Dr. trimble?

58:45.526 --> 58:48.320
- Yes, Mr. bartok.
- Let's get on with it.

58:48.529 --> 58:50.739
I'd like to see
these things work.

58:54.993 --> 58:58.205
- What the hell is this?
Just bypass the damn thing.

59:04.503 --> 59:07.714
- Son of a bitch.
- Trimble, my Patience is wearing thin.

59:07.923 --> 59:13.011
Sir, it seems the head of this project
has seen fit to install a password.

59:13.554 --> 59:15.722
- Martin has installed
a password? Yes, sir.

59:15.973 --> 59:18.433
We can't access the
system without it.

59:18.642 --> 59:20.727
Well, feed it words at random.

59:24.439 --> 59:25.941
He's booby trapped it.

59:26.150 --> 59:31.280
The first wrong guess we make would
automatically erase the programming.

59:31.780 --> 59:33.490
"What is the magic word"?

59:33.699 --> 59:37.119
"Abracadabra." That's the magic
word. Everybody knows that.

59:37.327 --> 59:38.327
No.

59:39.746 --> 59:42.416
No, there is a
real magic word...

59:42.749 --> 59:45.252
and only Martin
knows what it is.

59:45.502 --> 59:48.255
This is the word that
makes it all happen.

59:49.965 --> 59:51.592
Damn!

59:54.011 --> 59:55.554
Clever.

59:56.305 --> 59:57.848
Clever boy.

01:00:45.145 --> 01:00:46.688
- Martin!
- Don't be frightened.

01:00:47.856 --> 01:00:49.358
Oh, my god.

01:00:51.068 --> 01:00:52.694
What happened?

01:00:56.198 --> 01:00:58.325
I didn't know where else to go.

01:01:00.869 --> 01:01:03.747
You need your medication.
We have to get you back.

01:01:05.165 --> 01:01:08.418
There's no medication
for what I have.

01:01:08.669 --> 01:01:09.669
What?

01:01:09.837 --> 01:01:11.672
There never was.

01:01:16.301 --> 01:01:18.762
They were all just...

01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:21.682
waiting for...

01:01:21.932 --> 01:01:23.142
For this...

01:01:23.892 --> 01:01:24.893
to happen.

01:01:29.231 --> 01:01:30.691
I had to see you, Beth.

01:01:34.236 --> 01:01:36.029
Do you want me to go?

01:01:40.492 --> 01:01:41.535
No.

01:01:43.954 --> 01:01:45.873
Then help me.

01:01:50.294 --> 01:01:51.378
Please?

01:01:54.423 --> 01:01:55.465
Yes.

01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:07.352
All right, let's go.

01:02:15.194 --> 01:02:18.614
Thomas, go upstairs.
Chris, help out.

01:02:23.118 --> 01:02:25.370
- Anything upstairs,
Thomas? Only a cat.

01:02:25.621 --> 01:02:26.747
Jesus!

01:02:27.372 --> 01:02:29.875
Go check the dock.
Chris, go with him.

01:02:33.045 --> 01:02:34.046
The girl?

01:02:34.296 --> 01:02:35.714
<i>She went with him.</i>

01:02:35.964 --> 01:02:38.217
Well, get back here
as soon as you can.

01:02:38.967 --> 01:02:42.888
Yes. don't worry, sir, we'll get
him. It's just a matter of time.

01:02:43.472 --> 01:02:46.141
That, sadly, is a
luxury we don't have.

01:03:42.781 --> 01:03:44.199
<i>Go away.</i>

01:03:46.535 --> 01:03:49.830
<i>- We have to talk to you, sir.
- I said piss off!</i>

01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:55.669
Seth brundle was my father.

01:04:16.064 --> 01:04:18.400
Striking family resemblance.

01:04:19.902 --> 01:04:21.945
Little big for 5 years old.

01:04:22.154 --> 01:04:24.865
I have a chromosomal
malfunction.

01:04:25.073 --> 01:04:28.952
I'm growing at an
accelerated rate.

01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:31.955
No shit? That's fascinating.

01:04:33.874 --> 01:04:35.083
Well...

01:04:36.627 --> 01:04:38.253
Listen, it's been great.

01:04:38.504 --> 01:04:40.506
Stop by again some time.

01:04:47.679 --> 01:04:49.890
Perhaps I should invite you in.

01:04:51.850 --> 01:04:54.937
I saw you on the videotape.

01:04:55.187 --> 01:04:56.563
Don't sit there!

01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:04.196
You were there the
night my father died.

01:05:04.446 --> 01:05:07.407
He was working on a cure.

01:05:11.411 --> 01:05:15.749
That's why you dragged yourself out
here? To find out about a cure?

01:05:15.999 --> 01:05:17.626
You're my only hope.

01:05:24.132 --> 01:05:25.634
Oh, kid...

01:05:25.884 --> 01:05:30.264
the last thing I
am is anybody's hope.

01:05:30.639 --> 01:05:33.267
You really don't want
to hear about this.

01:05:34.601 --> 01:05:36.186
I have to know.

01:05:38.147 --> 01:05:42.276
Brundle stole my girl.

01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:44.236
Your mother.

01:05:44.486 --> 01:05:47.447
Got her pregnant,
caused her death.

01:05:48.031 --> 01:05:50.868
Dissolved my hand and
my foot with fly vomit.

01:05:51.118 --> 01:05:54.121
I had no love for the man.

01:05:56.915 --> 01:05:58.500
He bugged me.

01:06:01.211 --> 01:06:04.965
As for the cure he
was working on...

01:06:07.676 --> 01:06:10.179
he dragged your mother...

01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:13.974
kicking and screaming
into that telepod...

01:06:14.224 --> 01:06:19.354
that they might be fused
together in one beautiful body.

01:06:19.855 --> 01:06:23.650
So your mother blew his
brains out with a shotgun.

01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:25.944
There's your cure.

01:06:29.531 --> 01:06:30.574
Go away.

01:06:30.782 --> 01:06:34.369
You bastard! Where's
your compassion?

01:06:34.828 --> 01:06:38.123
I had to give it up. It
cost me an arm and a leg.

01:06:42.878 --> 01:06:44.796
It cost you more than that.

01:06:48.634 --> 01:06:50.928
Your father was right
about one thing.

01:06:51.136 --> 01:06:54.181
If there's a cure, it has
something to do with those pods.

01:06:56.350 --> 01:06:57.726
That...

01:06:58.352 --> 01:07:00.020
They won't work.

01:07:00.938 --> 01:07:03.357
You're a bad liar, kid.

01:07:03.649 --> 01:07:06.151
If you found the answer, use it.

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:07.778
Martin, did you find...?

01:07:08.028 --> 01:07:11.490
It's nothing I can
use. So forget it.

01:07:12.074 --> 01:07:13.242
Let's go.

01:07:13.742 --> 01:07:16.286
You should talk some
sense to your friend.

01:07:18.664 --> 01:07:20.666
They'll be looking for your car.

01:07:20.874 --> 01:07:22.960
My Jeep's in the garage.

01:07:24.586 --> 01:07:25.671
Just...

01:07:27.297 --> 01:07:28.799
get out.

01:07:39.184 --> 01:07:42.938
- Let me just call bartok.
- No, I'm not going back there.

01:07:43.147 --> 01:07:45.274
He can help. I'll tell
him about the tele...

01:07:45.524 --> 01:07:48.569
- That's a dead end.
- You haven't told me why.

01:07:48.819 --> 01:07:52.614
The only way I could save myself
would be to sacrifice another life.

01:08:41.205 --> 01:08:44.082
I'd like a room, please.

01:08:46.542 --> 01:08:48.086
All I have is a queen size.

01:08:48.337 --> 01:08:50.546
Is that okay?

01:08:50.796 --> 01:08:52.424
That'll be fine.

01:08:58.555 --> 01:09:00.557
Cash in advance.

01:09:03.977 --> 01:09:07.773
<i>Brundle vanished late last night
with co-worker, Beth Logan.</i>

01:09:08.023 --> 01:09:11.527
<i>There has been speculation that
Ms. Logan was kidnapped...</i>

01:09:11.777 --> 01:09:13.946
<i>but this has yet
to be confirmed.</i>

01:09:14.822 --> 01:09:15.863
Number nine...

01:09:16.698 --> 01:09:18.075
miss...

01:09:19.576 --> 01:09:21.203
smith.

01:09:23.372 --> 01:09:24.747
Martin?

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:28.502
Martin!

01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:30.587
Martin!

01:09:33.131 --> 01:09:34.341
Martin!

01:09:46.937 --> 01:09:49.148
Martin, stop.

01:09:55.279 --> 01:09:58.323
Please don't run away from me.

01:10:02.327 --> 01:10:04.079
I don't know what to do.

01:10:04.872 --> 01:10:06.248
I don't either.

01:10:08.333 --> 01:10:12.087
Martin, I'm not gonna leave you.

01:10:13.589 --> 01:10:14.798
No.

01:10:43.452 --> 01:10:46.079
How peaceful that light is.

01:10:50.417 --> 01:10:52.127
Compelling.

01:10:55.964 --> 01:10:57.132
What?

01:11:08.101 --> 01:11:09.228
You...

01:11:09.937 --> 01:11:11.313
should go.

01:11:19.738 --> 01:11:21.323
You need help.

01:11:22.449 --> 01:11:25.285
You don't think I can
take care of myself?

01:11:28.914 --> 01:11:30.290
No.

01:11:32.584 --> 01:11:34.253
You can't walk.

01:11:42.636 --> 01:11:43.887
You're getting worse.

01:11:44.346 --> 01:11:46.974
I'm getting better.

01:11:48.392 --> 01:11:49.852
My body...

01:11:50.102 --> 01:11:51.395
is growing...

01:11:53.021 --> 01:11:54.523
stronger.

01:11:56.650 --> 01:11:59.069
I feel good.

01:11:59.444 --> 01:12:01.572
You don't know what
you're saying.

01:12:02.239 --> 01:12:04.700
I do know what I'm saying.

01:12:07.870 --> 01:12:12.666
Until now, I've been nothing
more than an open wound.

01:12:12.916 --> 01:12:14.585
Defenseless...

01:12:14.793 --> 01:12:17.421
weak, vulnerable.

01:12:18.130 --> 01:12:19.256
Don't you see...

01:12:20.716 --> 01:12:22.426
I'm healing.

01:12:27.806 --> 01:12:29.516
I'm healing.

01:12:32.728 --> 01:12:35.564
It wasn't clear to
me for a long time.

01:12:38.650 --> 01:12:40.152
But now...

01:12:57.461 --> 01:13:00.172
I can see so much better now.

01:13:02.466 --> 01:13:07.387
Beth, if you stay a while,
I'll show you a magic trick...

01:13:07.638 --> 01:13:09.765
you'll never forget.

01:13:44.675 --> 01:13:47.928
Martin, what about the telepods?

01:13:50.472 --> 01:13:53.976
You must tell me what
the magic word is.

01:13:54.184 --> 01:13:57.688
The word is...

01:14:00.190 --> 01:14:02.317
It's a secret word.

01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:47.362
Do you remember
this room, Martin?

01:14:47.571 --> 01:14:49.990
This is where you were
born the first time.

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:54.661
It's proper that this is the place
for your rebirth, don't you think?

01:14:55.787 --> 01:14:58.624
You're growing so
quickly, my boy.

01:15:01.585 --> 01:15:03.378
Any prediction how soon?

01:15:04.755 --> 01:15:06.715
I'd say at least a week.

01:15:09.968 --> 01:15:11.345
Martin...

01:15:12.763 --> 01:15:14.473
if you can hear me...

01:15:15.057 --> 01:15:18.644
I wanted to tell you I'm
thrilled to have you back.

01:15:19.228 --> 01:15:21.396
How it was naughty
of you to run away.

01:15:22.147 --> 01:15:23.190
I forgive you.

01:15:25.943 --> 01:15:27.402
I should thank you...

01:15:28.445 --> 01:15:31.406
for the magic you
worked with my telepods.

01:15:32.282 --> 01:15:34.701
Don't ever forget that, Martin.

01:15:35.285 --> 01:15:38.747
You're a magician, not
an escape artist.

01:15:40.749 --> 01:15:42.835
Welcome home, son.

01:15:43.627 --> 01:15:47.214
Nothing's wrong with
me, you assholes!

01:15:47.422 --> 01:15:49.508
Let me go!

01:15:50.634 --> 01:15:52.845
Where's Martin?

01:15:53.846 --> 01:15:56.390
Where's Martin?

01:15:56.682 --> 01:15:59.143
It's dirty work, MacKenzie,
but somebody's gotta do it.

01:15:59.393 --> 01:16:01.395
Make sure you don't
miss anything.

01:16:07.609 --> 01:16:11.697
You'll be pleased to know you
show no signs of contamination.

01:16:12.197 --> 01:16:14.116
Please, sit down.

01:16:18.579 --> 01:16:20.372
You really have no choice.

01:16:22.207 --> 01:16:23.542
Where is Martin?

01:16:23.792 --> 01:16:26.211
He's doing very, very
well. Thank you.

01:16:26.461 --> 01:16:28.297
Resting comfortably.

01:16:28.714 --> 01:16:31.425
But of more importance
right now...

01:16:31.842 --> 01:16:34.136
is you telling me...

01:16:36.305 --> 01:16:38.307
the magic word.

01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:28.954
Dr. jainway?

01:21:29.932 --> 01:21:30.974
Dr. Shepard?

01:21:32.976 --> 01:21:34.061
What's wrong?

01:21:34.311 --> 01:21:36.396
What's happening,
man? What is it?

01:21:36.605 --> 01:21:38.816
Back in the O.R.

01:21:43.195 --> 01:21:46.532
You were alone with him all
that time, just you and he.

01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:48.826
He must've told you something.

01:21:49.076 --> 01:21:52.621
You have no intention of helping
Martin, and you never did.

01:21:55.999 --> 01:21:59.044
You're not going
anywhere. Vargas.

01:22:00.337 --> 01:22:04.091
Bartok, Martin got out of his
cocoon. He's out there somewhere.

01:22:04.341 --> 01:22:06.051
- Has anyone seen him?
- Yeah.

01:22:06.301 --> 01:22:08.846
Dr. jainway. She's
dead. He killed her.

01:22:09.972 --> 01:22:12.641
Control, this is bartok.
Listen carefully.

01:22:12.891 --> 01:22:16.603
I do not under any circumstances
want Martin injured or killed.

01:22:16.854 --> 01:22:18.188
He is to be contained.

01:22:18.856 --> 01:22:22.526
<i>Anyone responsible for damage to him
will answer to me. Is that clear?</i>

01:22:22.776 --> 01:22:24.528
Yes, sir. Code four alert.

01:22:24.987 --> 01:22:28.157
<i>Code four unit,
quarters 12, 14 and 17.</i>

01:22:28.407 --> 01:22:30.117
<i>Subject is dangerous.</i>

01:22:30.325 --> 01:22:32.327
<i>All zone four units to be armed.</i>

01:22:32.578 --> 01:22:35.247
<i>This is to be a live capture.
Repeat, live capture.</i>

01:22:53.140 --> 01:22:57.352
Control, at the end of corridor a,
something's moving around down there.

01:22:57.561 --> 01:23:00.355
There are no other exits.
You've got it trapped.

01:23:00.814 --> 01:23:02.316
Sick him.

01:23:48.695 --> 01:23:49.863
Let's check it out.

01:25:26.210 --> 01:25:28.462
- Has anyone found him?
- Not yet.

01:25:28.712 --> 01:25:31.089
We're not exactly sure
what he looks like.

01:25:32.132 --> 01:25:34.968
Hold it. You wouldn't believe
what I'm looking at, sir.

01:25:35.177 --> 01:25:37.221
Whatever it is, it's
dragging a body.

01:25:37.679 --> 01:25:39.890
What direction is it headed?

01:25:40.808 --> 01:25:44.561
I'd have to say, Mr. bartok, it's
headed right in your direction.

01:25:46.772 --> 01:25:47.815
Seal the door.

01:25:48.023 --> 01:25:51.235
Get reinforcements. We can
trap him in the hallway.

01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:21.181
- It's got a security card.
- Erase the code?

01:26:21.431 --> 01:26:22.641
Trimble!

01:26:43.036 --> 01:26:45.164
I've got him. He's
right outside bay 17.

01:26:45.372 --> 01:26:47.666
Send reinforcements right now!

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:53.297
Shit!

01:26:58.594 --> 01:27:01.847
Great, just fucking great.

01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:43.138
Come on, freak.

01:27:49.478 --> 01:27:51.271
Shit!

01:27:54.775 --> 01:27:58.362
Sorry guys, looks
like I lost him.

01:27:58.654 --> 01:28:00.864
There's no sign of him anywhere.

01:28:20.759 --> 01:28:22.177
It can't get in here, can it?

01:28:22.427 --> 01:28:24.638
Nothing gets through
those doors.

01:28:25.764 --> 01:28:27.975
The upper doors have
a manual lockout.

01:28:28.225 --> 01:28:29.852
Vargas, let's get him.

01:28:59.214 --> 01:29:01.842
- Jesus, look at that.
- Dispatch.

01:29:02.885 --> 01:29:06.096
Medical emergency, bay
17. I got two men down.

01:29:06.305 --> 01:29:07.890
I'm going after it.

01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:10.934
Paul stay with him. The rest
of you let's go. Come on!

01:29:23.155 --> 01:29:26.241
- Just tell them to kill it.
- Don't be an idiot.

01:29:26.617 --> 01:29:29.495
I need a live subject.
Martin is of no use dead.

01:29:29.703 --> 01:29:33.415
He's right, Mr. bartok. Your Martin's
already killed three people.

01:29:34.374 --> 01:29:39.171
That's tragic and sad, but I haven't
come this far to lose everything now.

01:29:47.387 --> 01:29:49.473
Clever. Clever boy.

01:29:54.019 --> 01:29:56.480
<i>Control, he's in the air
ducts headed for zone four.</i>

01:29:56.688 --> 01:29:58.482
Control, where's
that air duct lead?

01:29:58.982 --> 01:30:01.151
Hold on, hold on.
I'm getting it.

01:30:03.070 --> 01:30:04.112
Where?!

01:30:06.698 --> 01:30:10.577
Bay 17, observation level.

01:30:19.545 --> 01:30:21.213
Martin.

01:30:27.886 --> 01:30:30.013
- Don't shoot, idiot!
- Kill the damn thing.

01:30:30.222 --> 01:30:31.223
- No!
- No!

01:30:43.569 --> 01:30:44.695
Vargas!

01:30:46.530 --> 01:30:48.699
Vargas, get out of there!

01:31:09.803 --> 01:31:11.221
I want him alive, damn you.

01:31:31.992 --> 01:31:33.368
Scorby!

01:33:19.308 --> 01:33:22.060
We're outside bay 17,
we're cutting in.

01:33:26.857 --> 01:33:27.900
Spray the room.

01:33:38.327 --> 01:33:39.411
Fuck.

01:34:27.793 --> 01:34:29.002
Fuck!

01:34:41.598 --> 01:34:42.766
Scorby?

01:34:43.851 --> 01:34:45.727
Scorby!

01:34:45.936 --> 01:34:47.354
Where are you?

01:35:06.123 --> 01:35:08.250
No. No, no!

01:35:30.063 --> 01:35:31.106
Martin...

01:35:31.607 --> 01:35:34.067
I know you can understand me.

01:35:34.651 --> 01:35:36.570
Don't do anything rash.

01:35:37.237 --> 01:35:40.574
I won't hesitate to kill you
in a second, if I have to.

01:36:11.563 --> 01:36:14.525
I almost wish it didn't
have to end like this.

01:36:17.402 --> 01:36:18.654
Goodbye, Martin.

01:37:09.329 --> 01:37:11.456
What are you doing? No!

01:37:12.916 --> 01:37:13.916
No.

01:37:16.545 --> 01:37:17.545
No!

01:37:21.592 --> 01:37:23.552
No!

01:37:37.232 --> 01:37:38.567
No!

01:37:39.026 --> 01:37:40.026
Don't!

01:37:49.995 --> 01:37:51.038
No.

01:37:55.876 --> 01:37:57.211
No!

01:38:52.766 --> 01:38:53.766
Martin!

01:38:55.144 --> 01:38:56.979
Martin!

01:39:04.778 --> 01:39:05.946
Martin.

01:39:28.385 --> 01:39:30.971
- I'm all right.
- Martin?

01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:34.933
I'm all right.
