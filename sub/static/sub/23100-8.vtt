01:29.833 --> 01:31.958
You're it.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.791
My squish is musical.

01:40.833 --> 01:42.125
Squish?

01:47.208 --> 01:49.500
What is it?

01:49.625 --> 01:51.500
It's from the Big House.

01:51.625 --> 01:53.958
It's a machine.

01:54.083 --> 01:56.916
It's... coming this way!

01:58.500 --> 02:00.041
Watch out!

02:02.375 --> 02:04.500
I don't want to be squished.

02:10.791 --> 02:12.791
Stay calm. Stay calm.

02:12.916 --> 02:15.541
I have everything under control.

02:17.041 --> 02:19.166
I have nothing under control!

02:24.541 --> 02:26.125
Ah.

02:28.708 --> 02:30.916
-Are you okay?
-I think so.

02:31.041 --> 02:33.041
Everything looks kind of...

02:36.583 --> 02:38.833
Oh, that's better.

02:41.833 --> 02:45.666
-It's part of a Gigants machine.
-A machine for riding on.

02:45.750 --> 02:49.250
For riding on? Like a carnival ride?

02:49.375 --> 02:53.416
Oh, I do love a carnival.
Back when I was a young slug--

02:53.541 --> 02:55.208
Yeah, a carnival ride.

02:55.708 --> 02:57.583
As I was saying, a carnival--

02:57.708 --> 03:00.416
We can use it
to build our very own ride.

03:00.541 --> 03:02.250
Awesome!

03:02.375 --> 03:03.833
We just need a plan.

03:03.916 --> 03:05.583
We need to imagine...

03:05.708 --> 03:08.416
The best ride in the world.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.166
We have to think about
what's in front of us.

03:11.250 --> 03:15.458
This is what we have to work with.
We need to think of something more.

03:15.541 --> 03:16.625
I've got it.

03:16.750 --> 03:18.250
I do believe...

03:18.375 --> 03:20.666
I think I just...

03:20.791 --> 03:23.166
If we take that part, and, uh...

03:23.291 --> 03:25.708
Awesome.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.833
It's a Crick-O-Wheel.

03:45.916 --> 03:49.833
It's, uh... powered by a gaseous stink

03:49.958 --> 03:53.375
produced by Alex the Stink Bug.

03:57.250 --> 03:58.833
Ta-da!

04:04.625 --> 04:07.458
-It's awesome.
-Come on.

04:07.583 --> 04:10.291
How fast does this thing go?

04:16.250 --> 04:18.208
Hey, we need more gas.

04:18.333 --> 04:22.083
Uh, sorry, folks. I, uh...
I can't just make my stink up on cue.

04:22.208 --> 04:25.708
How do you make your stink,
Mr. Stink Bug?

04:25.833 --> 04:27.375
Pull my finger.

04:27.958 --> 04:30.708
Kidding. No,
I eat leaves from the Golden Tree

04:30.791 --> 04:34.458
on the far side of the garden.
Gives me gas to make my stink.

04:34.541 --> 04:36.833
The Faraway Golden Tree.

04:36.958 --> 04:40.250
That sounds, uh... far away.

04:40.375 --> 04:43.458
Yeah, it's a real pain in the bug
to get there,

04:43.583 --> 04:45.791
but no golden leaves, no ride.

04:45.916 --> 04:47.250
Up to you, folks.

04:47.375 --> 04:48.291
I'll go.

04:48.750 --> 04:52.291
It's a long way, but... it's the only way.

04:52.416 --> 04:53.791
Go, Kumi!

04:55.875 --> 04:57.875
Well, I mean...

04:58.000 --> 04:59.708
I could use some help.

05:19.125 --> 05:21.208
Whoa.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.500
The Faraway Golden Tree.

05:32.291 --> 05:35.875
You know the old saying,
"Whoever snuffed it, fluffed it."

05:36.000 --> 05:37.708
Well, that was my dad.

05:42.708 --> 05:44.708
Oh, my goodness gracious.

05:44.833 --> 05:46.166
Are you okay?

05:46.625 --> 05:49.250
I... made it.

05:49.416 --> 05:51.041
Here you go.

05:51.166 --> 05:53.416
Golden tickets for everyone.

05:53.541 --> 05:56.375
All ready for the ride's grand opening.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.375
Let me test one.

06:01.125 --> 06:02.666
Ah.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.000
Yep.

06:07.458 --> 06:09.416
They're the goods.

06:14.208 --> 06:18.708
There's one for every bug in the village.
Make sure they all get tickets?

06:18.833 --> 06:22.500
Of course. I'm all over it,
like a slug on lettuce.

06:39.458 --> 06:40.583
Yay!

06:41.916 --> 06:43.500
Uh-oh.

06:44.416 --> 06:45.875
Woo-hoo! All right!

06:50.333 --> 06:51.541
Whoa!

06:51.958 --> 06:53.750
Ouchie.

06:55.375 --> 06:57.208
Oh, no.

07:00.125 --> 07:01.458
That's it.

07:18.458 --> 07:21.041
You know if there are height restrictions?

07:21.125 --> 07:24.875
Oh, dear. I'm a little overexcited.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.791
I do tend to web myself.

07:26.916 --> 07:31.708
Welcome to the grand opening
of the stink-powered Crick-O-Wheel.

07:34.333 --> 07:37.958
Just form a line,
and have your golden tickets at the ready.

07:38.666 --> 07:41.500
Good morning, sir. Ticket, please.

07:42.833 --> 07:46.958
Uh, yeah, I kind of lost it... a bit.

07:47.083 --> 07:48.625
A bit? Which bit?

07:48.750 --> 07:51.666
The bit where it's lost. That bit.

07:52.166 --> 07:55.833
-Buzz, where's your ticket?
-I had an accident.

07:57.416 --> 08:02.041
-Crick?
-Uh... Yes. No. Sorry.

08:02.166 --> 08:05.583
Oh, I know I shouldn't have, but I did.

08:05.708 --> 08:10.583
It was so wrong. So wrong.
But they were so belly-licious.

08:10.708 --> 08:13.416
Walter, you ate the whole box?

08:14.333 --> 08:15.333
Mm-hm.

08:16.458 --> 08:18.625
So, no one has a ticket.

08:18.750 --> 08:21.750
No one has a ticket.

08:27.208 --> 08:29.541
Well, I'm going for a ride.

08:40.916 --> 08:42.500
Pardon me.

08:56.750 --> 09:00.458
Why should she get a ride,
when we can't?

09:00.583 --> 09:04.458

She doesn't care at all.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.916
Of course I care, Jay.

10:24.041 --> 10:26.125
I wanted us all to ride together.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.291
That would've been way more fun.

10:31.083 --> 10:32.750
She's sad.

10:32.875 --> 10:35.125
We've made her so sad.

10:35.250 --> 10:37.208
And it's all my fault.

10:39.333 --> 10:41.833
But they were just so belly-licious.

10:41.958 --> 10:44.875
There, there. By my calculations,

10:45.000 --> 10:47.125
it's a fraction of all our faults.

10:48.541 --> 10:52.083
And we have to fix it. Come on.

10:55.583 --> 10:59.708
Crick's right.
We all let Kumi down by not helping her,

10:59.791 --> 11:02.541
and not being responsible
with our tickets.

11:02.666 --> 11:04.000
Yeah!

11:04.125 --> 11:05.625
What's "responsible"?

11:05.750 --> 11:08.750
I guess that's what we're being now.

11:08.875 --> 11:10.333

11:27.500 --> 11:29.541
Look what we got.

11:29.666 --> 11:31.541
Golden tickets.

11:32.250 --> 11:36.875
And I call this the, uh...
the Crickto-Ticket Guard.

11:36.958 --> 11:38.916
Jay, too?

11:39.000 --> 11:40.625
-Mm-hm.
-Ehh.

11:40.958 --> 11:44.166
See, Kumi, we can be responsible...

11:44.291 --> 11:45.708
sometimes.

11:45.833 --> 11:47.125
Sorry.

12:11.250 --> 12:12.500
Mm.

12:26.583 --> 12:28.083
Good morning, bugs.

12:28.791 --> 12:32.125
Postman Bee, anything for us?

12:32.541 --> 12:34.291
Oh, yes, indeed.

12:34.416 --> 12:36.666
A package for Crick from...

12:36.791 --> 12:38.500
Doris the Spider.

12:38.583 --> 12:39.666
Huh?

12:40.416 --> 12:43.583
Oh, a tangle web for my new crickto-bed.

12:43.708 --> 12:47.166
It's a portable bed,
so you can, uh, sleep anywhere.

12:47.250 --> 12:50.125
Oh. Well, well. That could come in handy.

12:50.208 --> 12:53.500
Dr. Robert,
you're looking extra smiley today.

12:53.625 --> 12:57.375
There's a reason for that, Jay.
I'm going away on holiday.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.375
Oh, dear. Is that the time?

12:59.500 --> 13:00.875
I really must be off.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.083
Stay healthy, everyone. Bye.

13:03.916 --> 13:06.375
Oops, urgent delivery. Gotta go.

13:06.458 --> 13:11.791
Uh-oh. We're gonna be late
for Walter's musical. Come on.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.083

slithering up the slippery-- Aah! Ahem.

13:23.458 --> 13:26.208
Oh, my. What's happening?

13:26.708 --> 13:30.125
Oh, bugs. Ahem. I can't belly-lieve it.

13:30.250 --> 13:34.416
My voice...
My magnificent voice is gone.

13:34.541 --> 13:37.458
This is a catastrophe.

13:37.583 --> 13:40.125
Someone call Dr. Robert, urgently.

13:41.541 --> 13:43.875
He just went on holiday. Sorry.

13:46.708 --> 13:47.708
Whoa, uh...

13:47.791 --> 13:51.541
-Maybe we should take him home.
-But we'd have to carry him,

13:51.625 --> 13:53.708
which is kind of, well...

13:53.833 --> 13:57.208
I, uh... might have an idea.

14:01.208 --> 14:04.541
I'll go underneath for extra safety.

14:06.583 --> 14:09.208
Hey, look, a dandelion seed.

14:09.291 --> 14:10.541
Whoa.

14:14.125 --> 14:15.958
Buzz, are you okay?

14:17.666 --> 14:20.958
My spinners. Ouchie.

14:24.166 --> 14:27.333
Come on. Yeah. Oh, okay.

14:30.208 --> 14:31.875
Crick, be careful.

14:32.041 --> 14:33.291
What did you say?

14:35.208 --> 14:37.833
Ow, my foot!

14:37.958 --> 14:39.250
Stay right there.

14:39.375 --> 14:43.416
I'll get the first-aid kit
before you can say "awesome."

14:45.041 --> 14:46.291
Uh-oh.

14:51.333 --> 14:52.583
Awesome.

15:06.583 --> 15:08.041
Oh, uh...

15:08.625 --> 15:10.333
Welcome to Crick's hospital.

15:10.500 --> 15:15.416
Crick... Is my soup ready?

15:15.541 --> 15:18.250
My throat is so dry.

15:18.333 --> 15:23.625
-Oh, uh... Here we are, Walter.
-Thank you, Crick. Most kind.

15:23.750 --> 15:26.250
Emergency, emergency!

15:26.375 --> 15:29.208
-What's wrong?
-I's run out of slurp.

15:29.333 --> 15:31.750
That's the...? The emergency?

15:31.875 --> 15:33.708
I's really thirsty.

15:34.416 --> 15:36.833
-Aw...
-Crick...

15:36.958 --> 15:38.291
My soup?

15:38.458 --> 15:41.958
Oh! Uh, sorry. Coming, Walter.

15:42.083 --> 15:45.583
Kumi, why are you... out of bed?

15:45.708 --> 15:48.875
I need another pillow under my foot,
and you're so busy.

15:48.958 --> 15:50.125
Woo-hoo!

15:50.541 --> 15:54.333
-You're meant to be in bed, too.
-But it's so boring.

15:54.458 --> 15:57.750
And it's not like this will hurt my arm.

15:57.833 --> 15:58.666
Jay!

15:59.625 --> 16:04.291
Crick, hello? My soup, remember?

16:04.416 --> 16:06.916
Oh, sorry, Walter. Coming.

16:10.208 --> 16:11.541
Oopsie.

16:12.041 --> 16:17.833
Sorry, Walter. If you get out,
I'll change the blankets...

16:17.958 --> 16:21.208
My squish. It's going out of balance...

16:23.500 --> 16:25.125
Crick?

16:26.916 --> 16:28.750
I, uh...

16:28.916 --> 16:30.791
I may need help.

16:38.875 --> 16:42.500
Lefty loosey, righty tighty.

16:43.958 --> 16:46.041
Ah. Ah.

17:02.833 --> 17:05.708
Seriously? A robot doctor?

17:05.790 --> 17:07.125
Uh, yes.

17:07.250 --> 17:12.458
And I've programmed him
to take care of you all.

17:12.583 --> 17:15.790
You just push the red button
whenever you need him.

17:17.333 --> 17:20.665
-Does he have a name?
-Hmm. I... What about...?

Dr. Robot?

17:27.625 --> 17:30.583
That is a... a truly excellent name.

17:31.791 --> 17:33.250
You're awesome.

17:33.375 --> 17:34.291
Why, thank you.

17:34.416 --> 17:38.375
My creator Crick is a scientific genius.

17:38.500 --> 17:43.083
He's also spectacular at sports,
and handsome, and--

17:43.166 --> 17:47.375
Aw. heh. They don't need to hear all that.

17:48.041 --> 17:51.708
-This is, mm, mm... honeysuckle juice.
-Will it hurt?

17:51.833 --> 17:54.750
Negatory.
Please, open your, mm, mm, mouth.

18:16.833 --> 18:21.000
And now, young Buzz,
let me see... what I can do for you.

18:23.875 --> 18:28.333
Wow, my spinners feel better-er.

18:38.666 --> 18:41.875
Yes, high score for Jay!

18:42.000 --> 18:43.500
Sweet game, Dr. Robot.

18:43.625 --> 18:47.541
And you are a, mm, mm... great gamer.

18:48.416 --> 18:51.375
How, mm, mm... is that, Kumi?

18:51.500 --> 18:54.000
Perfect. Thanks, Dr. Robot.

18:54.125 --> 18:57.166
I wasn't sure about having
a robot doctor at first.

18:57.250 --> 18:59.791
