WEBVTT

00:02.036 --> 00:05.206
("I Walk for Miles"
by Dinosaur Jr. playing)

00:10.244 --> 00:15.583
* I walk for miles

00:15.616 --> 00:20.554
* I came for you

00:20.588 --> 00:25.693
* Stop for a while

00:25.726 --> 00:29.397
* What's left to do?

00:30.964 --> 00:36.337
* Left there so tired

00:36.370 --> 00:39.740
* Won't hold of you

00:42.143 --> 00:44.145
*

00:49.383 --> 00:53.254
* Set my heart is too

00:56.724 --> 00:58.192
(quietly):
Yes!

00:58.226 --> 00:59.427
(exhales)

00:59.460 --> 01:02.896
* Set my beats on you.

01:12.806 --> 01:14.808
*

01:22.650 --> 01:25.153
*

01:41.769 --> 01:44.572
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

01:44.605 --> 01:47.308
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

01:47.341 --> 01:49.777
* Gonna leave you anyway.

01:54.548 --> 01:58.085
JIMMY: He went to wipe it away,
and she said, "No. Leave it."

01:58.118 --> 02:01.322
And there it lay,
like a raindrop, tremulous,

02:01.355 --> 02:03.657
quivering...

02:03.691 --> 02:07.495
on the hood of her father's
beloved Aston Martin.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.132
(exhales)

02:12.166 --> 02:13.801
(doorbell rings)

02:33.887 --> 02:34.988
(sighs)

02:35.022 --> 02:36.390
Okay.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.661
Ugh! My car's
doing that thing

02:40.694 --> 02:42.496
where if I take my hands
off the steering wheel

02:42.530 --> 02:44.465
for more than, like,
ten seconds at a time,

02:44.498 --> 02:45.999
it starts drifting
all over the road.

02:46.033 --> 02:48.402
This came for you.

02:51.572 --> 02:53.707
What?

02:53.741 --> 02:55.609
We can litter
in our own front yard now?!

03:01.549 --> 03:02.850
So...

03:02.883 --> 03:05.586
my boss wants me to take
this new client out.

03:05.619 --> 03:08.188
Oh, I swear to God,
the last thing I need

03:08.222 --> 03:10.724
is another crazy
high-maintenance musician.

03:10.758 --> 03:14.328
Oh, my God! I just got
some video of a raccoon

03:14.362 --> 03:17.865
running down our street with
two fistfuls of Chinese food.

03:17.898 --> 03:21.101
The Internet is gonna go bonkers
for Chow Mein Raccoon.

03:21.134 --> 03:22.903
Oh, hey, this came for you.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.905
I know. It's trash.

03:24.938 --> 03:26.940
What is it?
My father's ashes.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.208
(screaming)

03:29.810 --> 03:31.545
Oh, I have to!

03:31.579 --> 03:33.213
(screams)
Okay.

03:33.247 --> 03:34.782
(groans)

03:38.652 --> 03:39.453
BOTH:
Oh!

03:39.487 --> 03:42.756
Oh, Jimmy! Ew! Ew!

03:42.790 --> 03:45.125
It's all chunky!
(groaning)

03:45.158 --> 03:46.594
(grunts)

03:46.627 --> 03:48.462
Oh, there's a note.
(blowing)

03:48.496 --> 03:50.864
Oh, hey, guys,
sorry, I-I don't have

03:50.898 --> 03:52.466
my pot card yet, so...

03:52.500 --> 03:54.001
Eject.

03:56.169 --> 03:58.105
(scoffs softly)

03:59.673 --> 04:01.575
(British accent):
"Shitty Jimmy,

04:01.609 --> 04:03.243
"here's Dad's ashes.

04:03.277 --> 04:05.245
"He wanted you to have
a memorial for him,

04:05.279 --> 04:07.648
because you're rich and
talk good." (laughs)

04:08.682 --> 04:10.384
You gonna do it?
Absolutely.

04:10.418 --> 04:12.953
I'm gonna just stop
writing my book because

04:12.986 --> 04:15.389
my father thinks I should
throw him a memorial service

04:15.423 --> 04:19.126
despite forgetting
my birthdays five through 33.

04:19.159 --> 04:21.762
Quick, let's rent
the Coolhaus truck!

04:21.795 --> 04:23.764
Jimmy, you know I'm here
if you ever want to...

04:23.797 --> 04:25.265
Have sex? Great. Let's go.

04:25.299 --> 04:27.468
Okay. But I have
a meeting later.

04:27.501 --> 04:30.871
So just keep me clean
from... here up.

04:43.016 --> 04:45.619
This...
(door closes)

04:45.653 --> 04:47.287
is Raul.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.423
He's interested in
playing with us.

04:49.457 --> 04:51.792
So, we're all playing?

04:51.825 --> 04:54.294
Well, you'll be watching
me and Raul playing.

04:54.328 --> 04:57.631
And absolutely,
down the line...

04:57.665 --> 04:59.633
we could do whatever
your thing is.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.969
Well, actually...
Yeah, down the line.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.208
I don't know if I can do this.

05:08.241 --> 05:09.543
I mean,
I don't even like

05:09.577 --> 05:11.445
watching other men
put gas in my car.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.647
But you said!
I'm sorry. I just can't.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.315
(pants)

05:15.349 --> 05:17.551
Maybe we could get
a couple's massage.

05:17.585 --> 05:19.620
Or I saw a Groupon

05:19.653 --> 05:21.655
for boudoir photography.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.857
I could wear a fedora.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.859
You could be my client

05:25.893 --> 05:29.329
whose legs go
all the way down to the floor.

05:29.363 --> 05:32.700
That sounds...

05:32.733 --> 05:34.668
(sighs)
fine.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.474
(gentle music playing)

05:40.508 --> 05:42.443
May I have this dance?

05:43.677 --> 05:45.345
(chuckles)

05:45.379 --> 05:47.180
See?

05:47.214 --> 05:48.181
We still have spark.

05:48.215 --> 05:49.583
(both laugh)

05:49.617 --> 05:52.753
I'd dip you, but my
stitches might pop out.

05:57.024 --> 06:00.394
Honestly, Gretchen,
I never cared about publicity.

06:00.428 --> 06:02.530
I mean, I was always
just Ben Folds,

06:02.563 --> 06:04.832
regular guy from North Carolina
who plays piano

06:04.865 --> 06:07.234
and smokes a pretty decent
pork shoulder.

06:07.267 --> 06:10.538
Anyway, since I've relocated
to L.A.,

06:10.571 --> 06:12.406
I guess I have to play
the game now.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.407
So here we are.

06:13.441 --> 06:15.543
I got to say,

06:15.576 --> 06:18.612
I was half expecting you to be
another high-maintenance diva.

06:18.646 --> 06:20.213
Oh, no, you're probably
thinking of Ben Kweller.

06:20.247 --> 06:23.383
I'm so sorry,
but I-I really love your music.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.619
No, no, no, no, I'm sorry.
It means a lot to me and my son.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.755
Mr. Folds and I are in a...
It's okay, it's okay.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.122
What's his name?

06:29.156 --> 06:30.390
Uh, Riley.

06:30.424 --> 06:32.526
Riley. And what's
Riley's thing?

06:32.560 --> 06:35.128
He's, uh,
pretty into baseball.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.564
Yeah?

06:42.235 --> 06:44.905
Wow! I had no idea you
were also an artist.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.740
You're everywhere, man!

06:46.774 --> 06:48.809
Well, maybe I'll
run into you again.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.646
Wow! You were so nice to him.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.314
A girl once asked

06:54.347 --> 06:55.749
my client Sam for his autograph,

06:55.783 --> 06:57.585
and he threw her crutches
into traffic.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.587
Oh, I don't know
about all that, Gretchen.

06:59.620 --> 07:02.155
I-I'm just a regular guy
from North Carolina

07:02.189 --> 07:05.959
who plays piano and smokes
a pretty decent pork shoulder.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.401
Got to say, Dad,
the work is flowing

07:14.434 --> 07:16.704
like it's never flowed before.

07:17.771 --> 07:18.972
Okay.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.276
Settle in.

07:23.310 --> 07:24.845
(sighs)

07:24.878 --> 07:27.848
"Normally,
she hated to be on top.

07:27.881 --> 07:30.918
"She liked the weight of a man
pressing down on her,

07:30.951 --> 07:35.689
"the liberation of not having
real agency in the shameful act.

07:35.723 --> 07:39.660
"But to be astride the man
was the only way she could keep

07:39.693 --> 07:42.462
"her gaze trained
on the two-way mirror.

07:42.496 --> 07:45.499
"Because when Kitty looked
into her reflection

07:45.533 --> 07:47.434
"and met her eyes,

07:47.467 --> 07:50.838
"she knew she was
also meeting Simon's eyes.

07:52.372 --> 07:54.842
Her brother's eyes."

07:54.875 --> 07:56.343
(chuckles):
Whoa!

07:56.376 --> 07:59.112
You did not see
that one coming, did you?

07:59.146 --> 08:01.549
Okay, that's it,
we're having a funeral.

08:01.582 --> 08:04.317
Your butt's gonna have a funeral
when I'm through with it.

08:04.351 --> 08:05.485
(laughs)

08:05.519 --> 08:09.189
Jimmy, clearly you
need some closure.

08:09.222 --> 08:11.024
My therapist told
me about this.

08:11.058 --> 08:15.295
Apparently, if you don't deal
with your emotional crap,

08:15.328 --> 08:17.698
it can mess your
shit up later.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.299
Oh, fine.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.835
Uh, we'll invite
a few people over,

08:21.869 --> 08:23.203
and then call it a day.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.138
You have to
make a speech.
Ack!

08:25.172 --> 08:27.474
The note said you talk good.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.509
Everybody know
Jimmy talk real good.

08:32.412 --> 08:36.483
Next we have Item 7-A,
which is the reading...

08:36.516 --> 08:38.518
Whoa! What?

08:38.552 --> 08:39.687
What?

08:39.720 --> 08:40.988
Okay.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.256
City Council Member
Todd Winterer

08:43.290 --> 08:46.259
initiated legislation
regarding a bus accident,

08:46.293 --> 08:50.330
but Council Member
Pam O'Connel abstained.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.232
Pam O'Connel!

08:52.265 --> 08:54.034
Who recommended
the purchase

08:54.067 --> 08:57.537
of two natural gas
street sweepers.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.206
But guess who
voted nay.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.008
Todd Winterer.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.711
Now, ask yourself why.

09:03.744 --> 09:04.778
Well, because...

09:04.812 --> 09:07.280
(doorbell rings)

09:07.314 --> 09:09.549
That must be the food.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.585
(TV continues playing quietly)

09:16.156 --> 09:17.958
(door opens)
PAUL:
Oh, my.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.961
You're not the food
delivery person.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.996
(door closes)

09:24.898 --> 09:27.067
Paul. What's going on?

09:27.100 --> 09:29.569
Lindsay, I know
how important

09:29.603 --> 09:31.805
this is to you, so...

09:31.839 --> 09:34.241
I found the gentleman
you picked out on the Web site.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.610
We FaceTimed,
and he's very nice.

09:36.644 --> 09:38.311
He goes to
Loyola Marymount.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.579
Go Lions.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.417
Paul.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.286
Anything for our family.

09:46.319 --> 09:49.256
Okay, so I don't know
how this works.

09:49.289 --> 09:52.793
Is there, like, a discussion
about what's appropriate?

09:52.826 --> 09:54.127
Or, uh...

09:54.161 --> 09:54.962
Go sit over there.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.330
Okay.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.366
*

10:12.780 --> 10:15.048
(slap, Lindsay moans)

10:20.688 --> 10:23.590
So what I found is that
marijuana really helps me

10:23.623 --> 10:25.993
with my symptoms, and
I-I was just wondering

10:26.026 --> 10:28.295
if there's some sort of form
I could fill out to make sure

10:28.328 --> 10:30.931
that it doesn't interfere
with my other benefits.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.133
You just walked into
a government building

10:33.166 --> 10:36.804
and asked if we'd be cool
with you taking illegal drugs.

10:36.837 --> 10:39.106
Maybe on your way home

10:39.139 --> 10:40.540
you can stop at the DMV

10:40.573 --> 10:42.442
and ask if they'll let you
steal some cars.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.344
Well, pot is legal
in California.

10:44.377 --> 10:45.813
Oh.

10:45.846 --> 10:49.149
You mean the independent nation
of California?

10:49.182 --> 10:51.218
Is that the army
you fought for?

10:51.251 --> 10:52.686
The Army of California?

10:52.720 --> 10:54.021
How'd they pay you?

10:54.054 --> 10:55.856
Avocados and screenplays?

10:55.889 --> 10:58.859
Wait. So are you saying that I
can't use marijuana medicinally,

10:58.892 --> 11:00.660
even though it's legal
in this state?

11:00.694 --> 11:01.895
I said no such thing.

11:01.929 --> 11:03.363
So I can use it?

11:03.396 --> 11:04.832
I don't know.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.968
All I know is that...

11:08.001 --> 11:10.838
(quietly): marijuana is
a Schedule 1 narcotic.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.205
And you're asking me,

11:12.239 --> 11:14.507
a government employee,
if you can take it.

11:14.541 --> 11:17.344
Let's call the police
and ask them.

11:17.377 --> 11:18.812
No, they won't have...
Hey, police.

11:18.846 --> 11:20.914
Which federally illegal drugs

11:20.948 --> 11:23.616
can this guy take that
will be cool with the V.A.?

11:24.852 --> 11:26.453
They want to talk to you.

11:34.762 --> 11:36.663
(sighs)

11:36.696 --> 11:38.698
(over P.A.):
Number 83.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.804
(footsteps approaching)

11:46.306 --> 11:48.175
Is that your eulogy?

11:48.208 --> 11:49.709
Of sorts.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.344
I've prepared a list
of heckles.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.747
Jimmy, shouldn't a
eulogy be heartfelt?

11:53.781 --> 11:57.017
All my father ever did
was take the piss.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.919
But I like the area you're in.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.755
How about, "Dad, I hope
you truly do rest in peace"?

12:01.789 --> 12:03.290
Oh.

12:03.323 --> 12:04.691
As opposed to how
you usually rest,

12:04.724 --> 12:06.359
in a pair of urine-soaked
sweatpants. (laughs)

12:06.393 --> 12:07.560
(knocking)

12:11.498 --> 12:12.933
Jimmy!

12:12.966 --> 12:14.734
It's me, Freddie.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.870
I worked with your dad
at the plant.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.872
Oh, yes,
now I remember you.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.774
You and dad used to
show up at school

12:20.808 --> 12:22.442
and heckle me
during gym class.

12:22.475 --> 12:23.911
What do you want?

12:23.944 --> 12:25.478
I live in Fresno
with me daughter now.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.547
Your sisters want me
to follow up with you.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.982
Apparently, you
blocked their numbers,

12:29.016 --> 12:30.550
and they want me
to tell you:

12:30.583 --> 12:32.953
A, you're to have the funeral;

12:32.986 --> 12:35.755
B, to make sure
to scatter his ashes;

12:35.789 --> 12:38.091
and C, don't fall into any shit.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.093
Ah! Well, tell them:

12:40.127 --> 12:42.295
A, we're already having
a service tomorrow;

12:42.329 --> 12:45.632
B, I will scatter his ashes,
into the toilet;

12:45.665 --> 12:48.101
and, C, you're grossly obese,

12:48.135 --> 12:49.602
brush your teeth,
and you're a whore--

12:49.636 --> 12:51.338
in descending
chronological birth order.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.473
Brilliant! Oh.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.909
I also have something
I'd like to read about Ronny,

12:55.943 --> 12:57.477
if it's okay with you.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.947
Actually, that sounds great.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.249
Yeah, tomorrow at 7:00.
And bring something to drink.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.784
If it's rosé, just keep it
Cotes de Provence.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.253
And maybe some ice.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.156
Cotes de Provence, ice.

13:09.189 --> 13:12.125
(quietly):
Cotes de Provence, ice.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.526
Well, I'm off the hook.

13:13.560 --> 13:14.761
What do you mean?

13:14.794 --> 13:16.429
We'll have the wake,

13:16.463 --> 13:20.333
that old fart will do the eulogy
and bring ice.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.369
It's perfect.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.642
*

13:29.676 --> 13:31.979
(singers vocalizing)

13:39.086 --> 13:41.955
(chuckles) When Raul was
doing me from behind,

13:41.989 --> 13:46.359
and I was thrusting my hips,
that was so hot, right?

13:50.864 --> 13:53.033
* My family deserted me...

13:56.169 --> 13:57.237
(chuckles)

13:58.338 --> 14:00.307
Oh, look.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.642
There's a bowl of
candy in a quadcopter.

14:02.675 --> 14:03.843
Entertain yourself.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.482
Ben? What are you doing here?

14:09.516 --> 14:13.253
Your office said you'd
recently experienced a loss.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.488
So I wanted to bring
some flowers.
Oh.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.490
And, of course, some of
my famous pork shoulder.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.491
Oh.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.027
It's just
what you do.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.194
May I ask who passed?

14:21.228 --> 14:22.862
Oh, my boyfriend's father.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.531
Oh, gosh, oh, no, that's

14:24.564 --> 14:27.067
terrible, terrible news.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.002
I'm incredibly
close to my Papa.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.671
Funerals are
so important.

14:31.704 --> 14:32.839
Who's playing?

14:32.872 --> 14:33.840
Playing music?

14:33.873 --> 14:35.608
Oh, uh... no one?

14:35.642 --> 14:38.611
(sighs) I've got my
piano in the truck.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.580
Okay, sure, that's...

14:40.613 --> 14:42.715
incredibly generous of you.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.585
(chuckles)

14:45.618 --> 14:47.554
Thank you, my love.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.222
(both chuckle)

14:50.223 --> 14:52.725
Whoops. Bubbles.

14:52.759 --> 14:55.128
Can't risk another
epiglottal infection.

14:55.162 --> 14:57.764
I'll just run
and swap this out.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.270
Something is up with you
two, and I don't like it.

15:03.303 --> 15:04.637
What's going on?
You'd be happy, too,

15:04.671 --> 15:06.473
if you weren't so poor now.

15:06.506 --> 15:09.309
Because you're my sister,
and I love you,

15:09.342 --> 15:12.379
I'll go sneak some
spanakopitas into my purse

15:12.412 --> 15:16.083
and give them to you later,
so you can feed your baby.

15:21.288 --> 15:22.322
(stifled sob)

15:22.355 --> 15:24.357
(piano playing somber melody)

15:27.961 --> 15:29.997
Hey, do you
have any weed?

15:30.030 --> 15:33.133
I can't afford it with this
stupid budget Becca's got me on,

15:33.166 --> 15:35.068
so I've been smoking
dried banana peels.

15:35.102 --> 15:37.070
Why don't you just
get a pot card?

15:37.104 --> 15:39.006
The V.A. says it'll
mess with my benefits,

15:39.039 --> 15:41.674
but it's, like, the only thing
that helps, so...

15:41.708 --> 15:43.143
I don't know what to do.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.978
The doctor in me
is like,

15:45.012 --> 15:47.147
you're the patient, take
what you've been prescribed,

15:47.180 --> 15:48.415
you dumb little bitch.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.649
Yeah, that's what I figured.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.518
But the human in me is like,

15:51.551 --> 15:53.286
"Smoke that ganj, yo."

15:53.320 --> 15:56.656
Real talk? It's bullroar that
you can't get a pot card.

15:56.689 --> 15:57.824
You went to war.

15:57.857 --> 15:59.292
And straight berserkered
on fools.

15:59.326 --> 16:00.994
That's an actual reason.

16:01.028 --> 16:04.964
Like, everyone at this party has
a pot card for a dumb reason.

16:04.998 --> 16:07.100
Gretchen said
she had insomnia.

16:07.134 --> 16:09.302
Lindsay said
her back hurt.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.504
Piano fingers.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.273
What reason did you use?

16:13.306 --> 16:15.208
I just said I saw a dog.

16:15.242 --> 16:16.443
Did you?

16:16.476 --> 16:17.510
No, man. Total lie.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.046
I didn't see a dog all day.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.014
Well, on TV, sure.

16:21.048 --> 16:22.449
You can't turn on a TV

16:22.482 --> 16:24.517
without seeing, like,
or four of them shits.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.319
(clears throat)

16:26.353 --> 16:27.554
(music stops)

16:27.587 --> 16:30.623
Hello. Thank you all for coming
to the memorial service

16:30.657 --> 16:33.193
for my father,
Ronny Overly.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.062
His friend Freddie
will do the eulogy,

16:35.095 --> 16:37.064
we'll toast,
and then you will leave.

16:37.097 --> 16:39.066
(Freddie claps,
piano plays upbeat tune)

16:39.099 --> 16:41.734
Cheers.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.870
Cheers, everyone.
(piano plays flourish)

16:43.903 --> 16:45.905
"Ronny Overly

16:45.938 --> 16:47.640
"was not only my coworker.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.342
"He was my hero.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.711
"He cherished his family,

16:51.744 --> 16:54.047
"especially his son, Jimmy.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.548
"I remember when

16:55.582 --> 16:57.084
"I came out to visit Jimmy.

16:57.117 --> 17:00.019
"Oh, bloody hell.

17:00.053 --> 17:01.654
"This was supposed to be
in the third person.

17:01.688 --> 17:04.691
"Oh, well. Ha, ha.
It's me, Ronny.

17:04.724 --> 17:09.028
"I wrote this in pen,
so I might as well keep going.

17:09.062 --> 17:11.164
"I just realized

17:11.198 --> 17:13.366
"Freddie has to read
whatever I say.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.168
"My name is Freddie,

17:15.202 --> 17:17.036
and I'm a..."

17:17.070 --> 17:18.538
I'm not reading that.

17:18.571 --> 17:19.939
Skipping forward.

17:19.972 --> 17:21.708
"Anyway,

17:21.741 --> 17:24.377
"I did my best to love him,
but he rejected me.

17:24.411 --> 17:27.714
"I sent him presents,
I visited,

17:27.747 --> 17:29.249
"I Facebook-requested him.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.851
"Anyway, I forgive him.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.453
"Please scatter my ashes

17:33.486 --> 17:36.256
"at the home of actor
Tony Shalhoub,

17:36.289 --> 17:39.392
"whose movie Big Night
you and I attended together.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.628
What's that, Fi?"

17:41.661 --> 17:43.130
WOMAN (whispering):
I think it's "Shalhoub."

17:43.163 --> 17:44.731
"Your sister just told me
he's a Paki.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.866
"Shit. Anyway,

17:46.899 --> 17:49.702
"after the movie, you turned
to me and said, 'That's what

17:49.736 --> 17:51.638
"'I want to do, Daddy.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.273
"I want to tell stories.'

17:53.306 --> 17:56.743
"And I said,
'You can do anything

17:56.776 --> 17:58.478
"you want, son.'

17:58.511 --> 18:00.947
"And so, you became a writer.

18:00.980 --> 18:02.949
"I did that.

"Anyway, I hope you ditch

18:18.865 --> 18:21.168
(piano plays upbeat tune)

18:21.201 --> 18:23.203
(quiet murmuring)

18:25.538 --> 18:28.441
Excuse me! Excuse me.
We are not done.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.277
First of all,
he is a liar!

18:30.310 --> 18:32.679
I begged him
to take me to Big Night

18:32.712 --> 18:34.347
so that we could bond,
but instead,

18:34.381 --> 18:36.283
he went to D3: The Mighty Ducks,

18:36.316 --> 18:37.984
and I watched Big Night alone.

18:38.017 --> 18:39.786
Then his movie was shorter,

18:39.819 --> 18:42.155
he forgot that I was with him,
so he left without me.

18:42.189 --> 18:46.493
For him to claim that he was
rejected after 18 years

18:46.526 --> 18:50.397
of constant rejection
on his part is crazy!

18:51.998 --> 18:54.100
In fact...

18:54.133 --> 18:56.503
(piano plays dramatic tune)

19:00.540 --> 19:02.809
I've prepared a list of heckles
for the occasion.

19:02.842 --> 19:04.211
VERNON:
Sweet.

19:04.244 --> 19:07.314
Uh, "Dad, fortunately,
your death wasn't too much

19:07.347 --> 19:09.382
"of a shock, considering
you already look like

19:09.416 --> 19:11.017
"someone put a Manchester jersey

19:11.050 --> 19:13.353
on the corpse
of a drowned person."

19:13.386 --> 19:15.154
(piano plays dramatic flourish)

19:15.188 --> 19:17.824
"Dad, you always were
a lady killer.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.026
"You gave all three
of my sisters genes

19:20.059 --> 19:22.061
"for alcoholism,
learning disabilities

19:22.094 --> 19:24.331
and morbid obesity."

19:24.364 --> 19:25.965
(laughs)
Ugh.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.900
I mean, we are talking
about a guy who was

19:27.934 --> 19:31.371
so narcissistic
that he wrote his own eulogy!

19:31.404 --> 19:33.206
What's next?!

19:33.240 --> 19:34.941
Are we...?

19:36.943 --> 19:39.579
Freddie, when did my dad
find out he was dying?

19:39.612 --> 19:42.715
He was diagnosed
some time last year.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.262
(piano plays upbeat tune)

19:55.295 --> 19:57.163
BEN:
Hey, folks,

19:57.196 --> 19:59.165
if, uh, you're gonna
Instagram this,

19:59.198 --> 20:02.535
be sure to, uh, hashtag
"BenFoldsSightings,"

20:02.569 --> 20:05.838
"BenFoldsIsEverywhere"
and "BenFoldsMovesToLA."

20:05.872 --> 20:09.276
If you do, I'll personally tell
you what Brick is really about.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.443
Abortion.

20:10.477 --> 20:12.779
No.
(plays upbeat tune)

20:23.222 --> 20:24.457
Hey, thanks for playing.

20:24.491 --> 20:25.925
You were really great.
(door opens)

20:25.958 --> 20:27.794
Ben! Ben! Over here, Ben!

20:27.827 --> 20:28.961
Over here, Ben!
Sorry.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.730
Not an appropriate
venue, bud.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.932
Now, I'll take some pictures
with you outside later.

20:32.965 --> 20:33.800
All right?

20:33.833 --> 20:35.568
Uh...

20:35.602 --> 20:37.136
Wasn't that
the same guy

20:37.169 --> 20:39.372
who asked for your autograph
at the ice cream place?

20:39.406 --> 20:42.975
What?! A paparazzi
and an autograph reseller?

20:43.009 --> 20:44.844
Scumbag.

20:47.146 --> 20:50.216
Okay, look, I moved to L.A.
a couple months ago,

20:50.249 --> 20:54.321
and, you know, everyone was so
excited when Moby moved to town.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.489
It was like,
"Moby bought that house.

20:56.523 --> 20:58.625
Oh, and Moby
opened that restaurant."

20:58.658 --> 21:02.228
Ben Folds moved to town? Bupkis.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.263
That's...

21:04.297 --> 21:07.500
That's incredibly...

21:07.534 --> 21:09.936
clever... of you.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.270
But, hey,

21:11.304 --> 21:12.805
it's my job now.

21:12.839 --> 21:15.608
Well, this was fun. Hey, guys,

21:15.642 --> 21:17.944
want to hit Big Wang's
or something?

21:17.977 --> 21:19.111
Get a couple drinks in me,

21:19.145 --> 21:20.313
I might tell you
what Brick's about.

21:20.347 --> 21:21.581
Abortion.

21:21.614 --> 21:24.016
Goddamn it.
How'd that get out?

21:28.220 --> 21:30.222
*

21:47.374 --> 21:50.042
(quietly):
Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

21:50.076 --> 21:52.078
I'm sorry.

21:54.246 --> 21:56.549
JIMMY: You know, when we had
that moment in the pub,

21:56.583 --> 22:00.286
I thought to myself,
"After 33 years,

22:00.319 --> 22:04.524
I'm finally having
a real moment with my father."

22:04.557 --> 22:06.225
(scoffs)

22:06.258 --> 22:08.895
Can't believe what a fool I was.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.163
There wasn't a shred of truth
in that moment.

22:11.197 --> 22:13.165
You were lying the whole time.

22:13.199 --> 22:16.403
You were dying,
you didn't say a word.

22:16.436 --> 22:20.072
All you had to do was say,
"Hey, Jimmy,

22:20.106 --> 22:23.376
"this might be the last time
I get to see you.

22:25.077 --> 22:28.147
Is there anything
you'd like to say?"

22:28.180 --> 22:30.517
And that way...

22:30.550 --> 22:35.422
despite decades of
neglecting, withholding,

22:35.455 --> 22:38.357
general assholery,

22:38.391 --> 22:41.794
I could have had
a modicum of closure.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.665
Goddamn you!

22:45.698 --> 22:49.669
I can hear you laughing at
the world "modicum" as I speak.

22:49.702 --> 22:52.572
Well, guess what.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.907
I'm getting my closure
right now.

22:56.909 --> 23:00.246
You do not get
to affect me anymore!

23:02.081 --> 23:04.283
So long, Dad.

23:05.317 --> 23:06.753
(grunts)

23:06.786 --> 23:09.456
* The captain runs his ship

23:09.489 --> 23:11.190
(crying)
* Into the rocks

23:11.223 --> 23:13.560
* Well, should we give him

23:13.593 --> 23:18.431
* A second chance with birth
and dying based on chance *

23:18.465 --> 23:20.733
* The first mate tried in vain

23:20.767 --> 23:24.070
* To reason with his leader

23:24.103 --> 23:26.372
* But he failed
to heed the warning *

23:26.405 --> 23:30.409
* Now there's wreckage
in the morning *

23:30.443 --> 23:35.548
* The ocean floor is filled
with forgotten gold *

23:35.582 --> 23:38.585
* And the tears
of fallen captains *

23:38.618 --> 23:42.889
* Keep the salty waters full

23:42.922 --> 23:45.492
* And you might
think his folly *

23:45.525 --> 23:48.227
* Obvious and blind

23:48.260 --> 23:51.263
* But who among us
hasn't needed *

23:51.297 --> 23:55.502
* Judgment tossed aside,
oh, no. *

23:56.503 --> 23:59.438
(dog barks)

24:02.475 --> 24:05.444
