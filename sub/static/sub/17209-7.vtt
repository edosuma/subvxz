WEBVTT

00:02.082 --> 00:04.751
Okay, this is a bit unorthodox.

00:04.752 --> 00:08.388
Normally, I do couples
counseling in my office.

00:08.389 --> 00:11.190
And, you know, one couple at a time.

00:13.994 --> 00:16.229
Now, how did this all start?

00:16.230 --> 00:19.032
(all speaking simultaneously)

00:19.033 --> 00:20.100
Please!

00:20.101 --> 00:21.501
Please!

00:21.502 --> 00:22.903
One at a time!

00:22.904 --> 00:24.771
(all speaking simultaneously)

00:24.772 --> 00:26.039
I'll go first!

00:26.040 --> 00:29.676
It all started when my
dumbass fool of a husband

00:29.677 --> 00:31.912
sent flowers to another woman.

00:31.913 --> 00:33.246
Uh, if you don't mind,

00:33.247 --> 00:36.082
this dumbass fool of a
husband can tell his own story.

00:36.083 --> 00:38.017
(knock on door)

00:41.721 --> 00:43.355
Diane gave me the boot.

00:44.257 --> 00:46.226
When women kick their husbands out,

00:46.227 --> 00:49.828
do they actually hand
them a map to my place?

00:50.664 --> 00:51.998
FELIX: Teddy, what happened?

00:51.999 --> 00:54.568
Just last week at dinner,
you and Diane were engaged

00:54.569 --> 00:56.136
in a rather saucy game of footsie.

00:56.137 --> 00:59.205
Oh, that was fun to be in the middle of.

00:59.206 --> 01:02.542
Diane found out I sent
flowers to Serena Williams.

01:02.543 --> 01:04.044
It was completely innocent.

01:04.045 --> 01:06.645
I was just trying to
get her to sign my balls.

01:08.682 --> 01:10.916
For a charity auction!

01:11.985 --> 01:14.454
Well, did you explain
the situation to Diane?

01:14.455 --> 01:16.189
Yeah, but it's a little hard to talk

01:16.190 --> 01:18.725
when your wife is chasing
you with a pepper grinder.

01:18.726 --> 01:21.761
That woman can weaponize anything.

01:21.762 --> 01:23.763
Oscar, Teddy and Diane
are clearly in the middle

01:23.764 --> 01:25.432
of a marital crisis.

01:25.433 --> 01:26.816
Nah, this happens every few years.

01:26.817 --> 01:27.734
They fight,

01:27.735 --> 01:29.469
Teddy comes over here to cool down,

01:29.470 --> 01:33.640
they make up, and, bam,
they're back to foot foreplay.

01:33.641 --> 01:35.224
Well, then why does he have a suitcase?

01:35.225 --> 01:37.083
'Cause I want her to
think I'm not coming back.

01:37.084 --> 01:39.312
But this is just a decoy.

01:39.313 --> 01:40.846
- Chips!
- (laughs)

01:41.915 --> 01:43.049
And...

01:43.050 --> 01:43.949
Dips!

01:44.818 --> 01:46.353
Ah, it's gonna be so great.

01:46.354 --> 01:47.537
We'll grab a couple of beers,

01:47.538 --> 01:48.722
we'll watch the fight,

01:48.723 --> 01:51.256
and enjoy a little man-on-man action.

01:51.891 --> 01:54.194
That didn't sound right.

01:54.195 --> 01:56.795
Enjoy a little man-with-man action.

01:58.064 --> 02:00.133
Well, that's not better.

02:00.134 --> 02:01.968
Oscar, if these fights are recurring,

02:01.969 --> 02:03.890
then clearly there's a
problem that won't go away

02:03.891 --> 02:04.891
until it's addressed.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.573
Yes. On the other hand...

02:06.574 --> 02:08.139
(blows raspberry)

02:09.241 --> 02:11.678
Teddy, look, you are
a husband and a father,

02:11.679 --> 02:13.313
and, unlike Oscar, a mature adult.

02:13.314 --> 02:14.781
I think you know what to do.

02:14.782 --> 02:15.915
(sighs)

02:15.916 --> 02:16.916
He's right.

02:16.917 --> 02:18.084
Happy hour at Langford's?

02:18.085 --> 02:19.485
Happy hour at Langford's!

02:20.687 --> 02:22.422
Teddy, you've got to deal with this.

02:22.423 --> 02:24.326
Sorry, buddy, you'll have
to wait till tomorrow,

02:24.327 --> 02:28.696
'cause this dude and I are
about to go at it all night!

02:29.462 --> 02:31.802
Damn it!

02:31.803 --> 02:34.903

02:35.769 --> 02:37.170
OSCAR: <i>This is fun.</i>

02:37.171 --> 02:38.474
Can you believe Felix wanted you

02:38.475 --> 02:40.473
to call your wife and work it out?

02:40.474 --> 02:41.841
Yeah, like I would take advice

02:41.842 --> 02:43.610
from a guy who owns two unicycles.

02:43.611 --> 02:46.779
I know. Just get a bicycle!

02:48.682 --> 02:49.683
Oh, great, Emily.

02:49.684 --> 02:51.151
Can we get two beers here, please?

02:51.152 --> 02:52.852
Oh, I'm actually not working today.

02:52.853 --> 02:54.453
Perfect, don't have to tip you.

02:55.555 --> 02:57.257
We're actually here to celebrate

02:57.258 --> 02:58.992
- because we have big news.
- Mm-hmm.

02:58.993 --> 03:02.162
We are going to be roommates!

03:02.163 --> 03:04.064
Thought you were
already living together.

03:04.065 --> 03:05.765
No, I was just crashing at her place.

03:05.766 --> 03:07.549
So I asked her to move
in with me officially,

03:07.550 --> 03:09.502
- and she said yes.
- Yay!

03:09.503 --> 03:12.939
So the big news is you're
gonna continue to do

03:12.940 --> 03:15.542
the uninteresting thing
you were already doing?

03:15.543 --> 03:16.810
Don't rain on our parade.

03:16.811 --> 03:18.845
- Yeah, we're really excited.
- Mm-hmm.

03:18.846 --> 03:20.389
You're right, this is exciting. I'm...

03:20.390 --> 03:22.089
Still not getting you a beer.

03:22.782 --> 03:24.417
(cell phone chimes)

03:24.418 --> 03:26.519
Uhp, text from Diane.
Time to call it a night.

03:26.520 --> 03:28.054
- Aw.
- Sorry, buddy.

03:28.055 --> 03:30.590
My marriage takes precedence
over goofing off with you.

03:30.591 --> 03:33.592
Yeah, I remember she made
you put that in your vows.

03:34.661 --> 03:36.262
Oh, wait, it's from Felix.

03:36.263 --> 03:39.399
"I implore you to call your
wife and open up the lines

03:39.400 --> 03:41.263
of spousal communication
so the healing can..."

03:41.264 --> 03:42.435
How long is this thing?

03:42.436 --> 03:43.737
Forget that.

03:43.738 --> 03:45.572
Let's not let Felix ruin our night.

03:45.573 --> 03:47.116
Well, what if Diane needs to reach me?

03:47.117 --> 03:49.509
Would you stop letting
her call all the shots?

03:49.510 --> 03:51.678
Make her wait a little,
show her who's boss.

03:51.679 --> 03:53.012
Yeah!

03:53.013 --> 03:54.013
It's her, right?

03:54.014 --> 03:55.681
It's definitely her!

03:59.619 --> 04:02.287
(slurring): I just hope we're
on the right floor this time.

04:04.124 --> 04:05.125
(slurring): Yeah.

04:05.126 --> 04:07.193
That old man was a jerk.

04:07.194 --> 04:08.661
Freezer full of popsicles,

04:08.662 --> 04:10.562
he wouldn't even give us one lick.

04:16.702 --> 04:18.338
Yeah, this is the right place.

04:18.339 --> 04:20.206
All right.

04:20.207 --> 04:21.641
FELIX: Well, well.

04:21.642 --> 04:25.078
Look who is back from trying to
drown their problems in booze.

04:25.079 --> 04:26.679
I know that one!

04:26.680 --> 04:27.846
It's us!

04:28.982 --> 04:30.483
But you cannot drown your problems

04:30.484 --> 04:33.052
because problems know how to swim.

04:33.053 --> 04:35.888
Let's tie rocks to their legs.

04:36.956 --> 04:38.958
How about we pour some
scotch on those rocks?

04:38.959 --> 04:40.827
Nice! Nice!

04:40.828 --> 04:42.771
Hey, Felix, why don't you
relax and have a drink.

04:42.772 --> 04:43.763
Don't be silly.

04:43.764 --> 04:45.832
I've already brushed,
flossed, water picked,

04:45.833 --> 04:47.667
and done my gum exercises.

04:47.668 --> 04:49.335
Yes, because drinking
would get in the way

04:49.336 --> 04:51.570
of meddling in other people's business.

04:52.739 --> 04:54.962
Teddy, as a person who has
recently had his heart broken

04:54.963 --> 04:56.176
and fed into a wood chipper,

04:56.177 --> 04:58.745
I urge you not to take your
relationship for granted.

04:58.746 --> 05:00.689
Now, one of our neighbors
is a couples therapist.

05:00.690 --> 05:02.723
I would be happy to give you her number.

05:04.517 --> 05:05.852
Who cares about your happiness?

05:05.853 --> 05:07.387
Butt out.

05:07.388 --> 05:09.155
Oh, sure, I could do that.

05:09.156 --> 05:10.924
That would be the easy thing to do.

05:10.925 --> 05:12.425
The lazy thing to do.

05:12.426 --> 05:14.694
The Oscar thing to do.

05:14.695 --> 05:17.497
As opposed to the Felix
thing to do, which would be

05:17.498 --> 05:21.300
to burrow into everybody's
business like a manic badger.

05:22.569 --> 05:24.537
Race you to the bottom!

05:24.538 --> 05:25.738
Thanks, Teddy.

05:25.739 --> 05:28.141
Unlike you, Teddy gets it.

05:28.142 --> 05:30.910
More drinking...

05:30.911 --> 05:33.513
less thinking.

05:33.514 --> 05:35.548
Yes, sure. Who cares?

05:35.549 --> 05:37.150
Get drunk. Avoid everything.

05:37.151 --> 05:41.354
Now that sounds like the kind
of guy I would love to live with.

05:41.355 --> 05:43.923
So I suppose you're saying
you wish you'd chosen

05:43.924 --> 05:46.028
someone like Teddy to be
your roommate instead of me.

05:46.029 --> 05:49.002
Well, I didn't exactly choose you.

05:51.564 --> 05:52.999
What is that supposed to mean?

05:53.000 --> 05:55.568
Face it, Felix, you just kind
of showed up and never left.

05:55.569 --> 05:58.571
I just "showed up and never left"?

05:58.572 --> 06:01.241
So we agree.

06:01.242 --> 06:03.241
- Take it back.
- I won't.

06:04.177 --> 06:06.311
That wouldn't be the Oscar thing to do.

06:07.213 --> 06:09.548
And I'm Oscar.

06:10.850 --> 06:13.018
Fine. I know where I'm not wanted.

06:13.686 --> 06:15.688
Oscar and I had a fight.

06:15.689 --> 06:18.024
I know we just broke up,
but would it be all right

06:18.025 --> 06:19.368
if I slept on your couch tonight?

06:19.369 --> 06:20.326
Of course.

06:20.327 --> 06:21.728
Come in, honey.

06:21.729 --> 06:22.928
Thank you.

06:29.702 --> 06:32.471
I'll be right back with all the cellos.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.074

06:48.646 --> 06:50.814
(muttering): Oh, Rihanna, yeah.

06:57.889 --> 07:00.658
Oscar...

07:00.659 --> 07:01.892
Wake up!

07:05.029 --> 07:06.064
Hey!

07:06.065 --> 07:09.133
That was like an actual sit-up.

07:09.134 --> 07:11.002
What time is it? Where's my phone?

07:11.003 --> 07:13.037
I took it from you last night, remember?

07:13.038 --> 07:14.539
- Oh, yeah.
- Here you go.

07:14.540 --> 07:16.207
There it is, yeah.

07:16.208 --> 07:18.142
Oh, crap!

07:18.143 --> 07:20.411
Got 12 messages from Diane!

07:20.412 --> 07:23.408
DIANE (recorded):
Teddy-bear, this is silly.

07:23.409 --> 07:24.776
Come home, baby.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.778
Doesn't sound too bad.

07:26.779 --> 07:29.080
That was at 7:00 last night.

07:29.982 --> 07:31.950
DIANE: Theodore, where are you?

07:31.951 --> 07:33.751
Are you ignoring my calls?

07:37.523 --> 07:40.659
That was at 7:03.

07:40.660 --> 07:44.662
DIANE (angrily): Call my ass back!

07:47.199 --> 07:49.201
That was 7:21!

07:49.202 --> 07:51.637
Oh, my God, what am I gonna do?

07:51.638 --> 07:52.838
I should call Felix.

07:52.839 --> 07:54.462
- He knows about relationships.
- No, no.

07:54.463 --> 07:56.788
Felix will just get you to try
to talk about your feelings.

07:56.789 --> 07:58.210
This is a time for action, man.

07:58.211 --> 07:59.678
Ah, I don't know, Oscar.

07:59.679 --> 08:00.979
Teddy, trust me.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.281
Who's dealt with more
angry women than me?

08:04.116 --> 08:05.217
Go on.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.920
I know a jeweler who delivers.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.454
Whenever I piss a woman off,

08:09.455 --> 08:11.590
I just send her something
sparkly with a note

08:11.591 --> 08:12.925
that says something like,

08:12.926 --> 08:15.259
"I'm sorry I touched
your sister's boob."

08:16.161 --> 08:18.330
But, you know, you can make it your own.

08:18.331 --> 08:21.033
Yeah, that'll work.

08:21.034 --> 08:24.136
You know, I just say I screwed
up and I'm really sorry.

08:24.137 --> 08:26.838
I'll get you the phone number.

08:26.839 --> 08:27.940
Where's my phone?

08:27.941 --> 08:30.742
I'll call it for you.

08:30.743 --> 08:32.443
(muffled vibrating)

08:44.723 --> 08:46.891
You want me to leave you a message?

08:49.962 --> 08:52.798
Felix, you really didn't
have to make us lunch.

08:52.799 --> 08:54.800
Oh, please, it's the least I could do

08:54.801 --> 08:56.134
for you letting me stay here.

08:56.135 --> 08:59.071
Plus, I packed the panini
press; why not use it?

08:59.072 --> 09:00.739
(chuckles)

09:00.740 --> 09:02.374
Oh. What's up, roomie?

09:02.375 --> 09:03.675
Hey!

09:03.676 --> 09:05.939
Ooh, when I saw that panini
press in your bag last night,

09:05.940 --> 09:08.046
I was hoping it would end this way.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.314
Oh.

09:09.315 --> 09:10.682
- Pillow's back.
- Yeah.

09:10.683 --> 09:11.817
I put it out here last night

09:11.818 --> 09:13.418
and somebody brought it back to my room.

09:13.442 --> 09:14.586
That was me.

09:14.587 --> 09:17.289
Oh. I just thought it would
add a little life to the room,

09:17.290 --> 09:18.810
- but if you don't like it...
- No, no.

09:18.834 --> 09:20.692
It's great. Uh, but
it might, I don't know,

09:20.693 --> 09:22.694
look better somewhere else.

09:22.695 --> 09:24.562
Like, uh...

09:25.797 --> 09:26.964
Here!

09:28.700 --> 09:29.901
Adds a bit of mystery.

09:29.902 --> 09:31.903
It's like, "Ooh, what's that hiding

09:31.904 --> 09:35.007
behind that pretty pillow?"

09:35.008 --> 09:36.041
Great.

09:36.042 --> 09:38.210
- Oh, great. Let's eat.
- Yep.

09:38.211 --> 09:40.612
Nobody move!

09:40.613 --> 09:42.714
I am sensing some tension here.

09:42.715 --> 09:45.384
And, as we all know, the first 72 hours

09:45.385 --> 09:47.019
of a roommate relationship are critical.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.487
It's when the roles are established

09:48.488 --> 09:49.721
and the boundaries are set.

09:49.722 --> 09:50.722
Felix,

09:50.723 --> 09:52.257
it's just a pillow.

09:52.258 --> 09:55.793
And Manuela Carrasco was
just another flamenco dancer.

09:58.964 --> 10:01.700
No, I am sensing something
lurking underneath the surface.

10:01.701 --> 10:02.900
I really don't...

10:05.537 --> 10:08.874
Now, there are certain people,
whose name shall remain Oscar,

10:08.875 --> 10:10.742
who believe in ignoring their problems.

10:10.743 --> 10:15.213
But we shall face our problems head on.

10:15.214 --> 10:18.150
Don't worry, this won't take long.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.451
Emily,

10:19.452 --> 10:21.419
what kind of infant were you?

10:23.288 --> 10:25.390
She must have gotten
the bracelet by now.

10:25.391 --> 10:27.392
- Why hasn't she called?
- (knock on door)

10:27.393 --> 10:29.795
Oh, don't worry, you and
your wife will be breaking out

10:29.796 --> 10:32.931
the Barry White CDs before you know it.

10:32.932 --> 10:35.701
Delivery from Reisenbach Jewels.

10:35.702 --> 10:37.002
No, no! That's a mistake.

10:37.003 --> 10:38.852
You were supposed to
deliver that to my wife!

10:38.853 --> 10:39.653
I did.

10:39.654 --> 10:41.739
She told me to bring it
to you with this note.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.810
Oh, no, I'm too scared to read that.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.111
You should be.

10:46.112 --> 10:48.379
That woman is not well.

10:50.248 --> 10:51.750
What does it say?

10:51.751 --> 10:54.586
"Theodore, I don't know who you
screwed up with last night..."

10:54.587 --> 10:55.987
Oh, damn.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.589
"...but she must have been something

10:57.590 --> 10:59.091
if you're giving me diamonds."

10:59.092 --> 11:00.392
Oh, God.

11:00.393 --> 11:01.727
She thinks I cheated on her.

11:01.728 --> 11:03.762
And, look, she drew a
little picture of you

11:03.763 --> 11:05.831
with your head up your butt.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.733
I knew I should have called Felix,

11:07.734 --> 11:09.000
and now it's too late!

11:09.001 --> 11:10.968
You're like a little circle.

11:11.970 --> 11:14.005
But don't worry, I have a plan.

11:14.006 --> 11:16.274
Does it involve us drinking
ourselves into a stupor?

11:16.275 --> 11:17.808
Doesn't just involve it.

11:18.677 --> 11:20.077
That's the whole thing.

11:21.747 --> 11:23.281
No more drinking!

11:23.282 --> 11:24.616
Ever!

11:24.617 --> 11:26.317
Today.

11:27.285 --> 11:29.054
So, to summarize, we have learned

11:29.055 --> 11:30.555
it's not really about pillows,

11:30.556 --> 11:32.824
it's about Dani feeling marginalized

11:32.825 --> 11:35.193
when she's not allowed to
make decisions in her new home.

11:35.194 --> 11:38.230
I guess.

11:38.231 --> 11:41.066
And it's about Emily
feeling a loss of control

11:41.067 --> 11:43.168
as she transitions into cohabitation.

11:43.169 --> 11:45.836
Sure, why not?

11:47.005 --> 11:48.774
Excellent.

11:48.775 --> 11:50.208
- So, to recap...
- Damn it.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.743
Ah, so close!

11:51.744 --> 11:53.967
...we found it's not what's
being said that's important.

11:53.968 --> 11:56.047
It's what's underneath
what's being said.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.082
Agreed?

11:57.083 --> 11:59.384
If we say yes, can we eat?

11:59.385 --> 12:00.419
Yes, you may.

12:00.420 --> 12:01.819
- Then yes!
- Yes!

12:03.321 --> 12:05.524
Splendid.

12:05.525 --> 12:07.726
I just wish Oscar were here to see this.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.228
He would say, "Felix, you
were right, and I was wrong,

12:10.229 --> 12:12.363
like I am about most things."

12:13.698 --> 12:16.300
Well, I'm off to work.

12:17.669 --> 12:19.337
Which is different from my calling...

12:19.338 --> 12:21.505
helping people.

12:24.075 --> 12:25.976
You're right, no need to thank me.

12:27.245 --> 12:29.648
I thought that would never end.

12:29.649 --> 12:30.882
Yeah.

12:30.883 --> 12:33.919
I spent the last 20
minutes in my happy place.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.021
By the way, Denzel says hi.

12:36.022 --> 12:37.956
(laughs)

12:37.957 --> 12:40.225
So, about what Felix was saying,

12:40.226 --> 12:43.061
I'm sorry if you feel marginalized.

12:43.062 --> 12:44.429
No, no problem. I get it.

12:44.430 --> 12:45.896
You just don't like change.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.934
It's not that I don't like change.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.203
I mean, I asked you to be my roommate.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.138
That's a pretty big change.

12:53.139 --> 12:54.739
(both chuckle)

12:54.740 --> 12:56.308
Wait, wait, what does that mean?

12:56.309 --> 12:57.542
What? Nothing.

12:57.543 --> 12:59.910
'Cause if I'm looking underneath...

13:01.246 --> 13:03.281
...sounds like you're
saying it's too big a change.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.617
Nope.

13:05.618 --> 13:06.618
Not at all.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.086
Okay.

13:08.087 --> 13:10.589
See, I feel

13:10.590 --> 13:11.957
like you're putting

13:11.958 --> 13:14.259
words in my mouth.

13:14.260 --> 13:17.863
I let you change the decor,
just don't change my words.

13:17.864 --> 13:19.297
It's one pillow.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.198
One ugly pillow.

13:23.535 --> 13:25.871
Denzel was right about you.

13:25.872 --> 13:28.872
Denzel is overrated.

13:36.314 --> 13:38.282
Seriously?

13:50.459 --> 13:51.726
What are you looking at?

13:51.727 --> 13:54.463
Trying to find a new place to live.

13:54.464 --> 13:56.731
So far, the only thing in my price range

13:56.732 --> 13:59.668
is a used Chevy Vega.

13:59.669 --> 14:02.003
I might need a place, too.

14:02.004 --> 14:05.340
So dibs on the backseat.

14:05.341 --> 14:06.875
I got to wash this day off of me.

14:06.876 --> 14:08.443
I'm gonna go use Felix's shower.

14:08.444 --> 14:10.145
I used it this morning.

14:10.146 --> 14:12.000
You have to jiggle the handle just right

14:12.001 --> 14:13.014
if you want hot water.

14:13.015 --> 14:14.315
You could use my shower.

14:15.050 --> 14:16.016
I'm kidding.

14:17.085 --> 14:18.652
It even grosses me out.

14:19.688 --> 14:20.856
(cell phone rings)

14:20.857 --> 14:21.857
Hello.

14:21.858 --> 14:23.425
What?

14:23.426 --> 14:24.725
Okay.

14:27.095 --> 14:28.497
Diane's coming up here.

14:28.498 --> 14:30.899
Up here? Right now? Why?!

14:30.900 --> 14:32.866
I don't know! I'm scared!

14:34.402 --> 14:35.537
Where are you going?

14:35.538 --> 14:37.405
- To jump off the balcony.
- Teddy!

14:37.406 --> 14:38.607
No, it's okay.

14:38.608 --> 14:40.408
If I hit that awning just right...

14:40.409 --> 14:42.711
I'll die.

14:42.712 --> 14:44.411
(knock on door)

14:46.748 --> 14:48.383
Someone should answer the door.

14:48.384 --> 14:49.751
It's your door.

14:49.752 --> 14:50.752
It's your wife!

14:50.753 --> 14:52.120
You're closer! Open the door!

14:52.121 --> 14:54.021
All right.

14:58.860 --> 15:00.261
Hey, baby.

15:01.263 --> 15:02.596
Teddy.

15:06.902 --> 15:08.669
Hi, Oscar.

15:11.606 --> 15:13.340
Hey, baby.

15:15.944 --> 15:19.114
Teddy, this has gone far enough.

15:19.115 --> 15:20.715
I want you to come home.

15:20.716 --> 15:21.816
TEDDY: You do?

15:21.817 --> 15:23.785
Oh, thank God.

15:23.786 --> 15:25.859
I know I got a little upset,

15:25.860 --> 15:28.428
but you've never stayed
out all night before.

15:28.429 --> 15:30.664
I had a little too much
to drink and I fell asleep.

15:30.665 --> 15:31.965
That's what I figured.

15:31.966 --> 15:33.066
I miss you.

15:33.067 --> 15:35.969
Ooh, I miss you, too, snuggle-butt.

15:35.970 --> 15:37.170
You didn't hear that.

15:37.171 --> 15:38.772
If only.

15:38.773 --> 15:40.841
I'm sorry, baby.

15:40.842 --> 15:43.410
You're the only woman for me. (chuckles)

15:43.411 --> 15:46.445
Hey, Teddy, I need your
magic jiggle in the shower.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.453
You lying son of a bitch!

15:53.454 --> 15:55.589
No, no... you don't understand!

15:55.590 --> 15:57.590
She just needs me to get it hot!

15:58.458 --> 16:00.727
Talk less, Teddy! Talk less!

16:00.728 --> 16:02.696
Diane, this is all a misunderstanding.

16:02.697 --> 16:04.196
Oh, you're on deck!

16:05.465 --> 16:06.767
Dani!

16:06.768 --> 16:08.735
So you pack up your
suitcase but you forget this?

16:08.736 --> 16:11.872
I left it on purpose so people
might think you have some taste.

16:11.873 --> 16:13.607
Oh, really?

16:13.608 --> 16:16.777
I have so much taste that I can...

16:16.778 --> 16:18.110
taste it!

16:19.513 --> 16:22.949
I could have married Mercury
Morris from the Miami Dolphins.

16:22.950 --> 16:25.285
Now here we go with the
"I could have marrieds."

16:25.286 --> 16:29.623
Earl Campbell offered
to make my car payments.

16:29.624 --> 16:30.624
Oh, there you are. Good.

16:30.625 --> 16:31.725
I couldn't get into the apartment.

16:31.726 --> 16:33.029
Could I borrow one of your keys?

16:33.030 --> 16:33.760
You can have mine.

16:33.761 --> 16:35.662
I'm never going back down there again.

16:35.663 --> 16:37.097
Oh, why? Are they having

16:37.098 --> 16:39.532
a crappy pillow sale in Tackyville?

16:41.635 --> 16:45.172
Mean Joe Greene wasn't mean to me!

16:45.173 --> 16:46.473
Oh, yeah?

16:46.474 --> 16:48.842
Well, Miss Toni Braxton
told me I had a cute butt.

16:48.843 --> 16:51.411
Well, if you could get Toni Braxton,

16:51.412 --> 16:54.247
why you settling for
dinner scraps over here?

16:54.248 --> 16:56.248
Who you calling "dinner scraps"?

16:56.783 --> 16:57.918
Oh, you know what?

16:57.919 --> 17:01.455
(all arguing)

17:01.456 --> 17:04.490
So there's a therapist
in the building, you say?

17:07.294 --> 17:09.162
And that's when we called you.

17:09.163 --> 17:10.696
Okay.

17:10.698 --> 17:12.598
There's a lot to process here.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.000
Yes, a lot of emotions to unpack.

17:14.001 --> 17:18.271
We have our work cut out for
us, don't we, Dr. Goldman?

17:18.271 --> 17:21.174
Felix, I didn't know
you were a therapist.

17:21.175 --> 17:22.675
I'm not.

17:23.643 --> 17:26.011
Why, do I threaten you?

17:27.280 --> 17:28.415
See? Meddling.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.050
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

17:30.051 --> 17:31.551
(chuckles) He calls me a meddler.

17:31.552 --> 17:32.886
And after all the times

17:32.887 --> 17:35.856
I stepped in to help him
without him even asking.

17:35.857 --> 17:37.124
You know what?

17:37.125 --> 17:39.259
I have dinner reservations
in, ooh, ten minutes.

17:39.260 --> 17:40.961
So we're gonna cut to the chase.

17:40.962 --> 17:42.262
Diane and...

17:42.263 --> 17:45.531
I'm sorry, I didn't get
your name, dumbass fool.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.835
It's Teddy.

17:48.836 --> 17:52.572
You said you have these
fights every so often.

17:52.573 --> 17:55.275
But this one seemed to
escalate out of control

17:55.276 --> 17:58.211
when Teddy let Oscar get involved.

17:58.212 --> 17:59.646
Wait a minute.

17:59.647 --> 18:02.248
You taking advice from this chump?

18:03.250 --> 18:04.851
Hey!

18:04.852 --> 18:06.787
Yeah, you're probably right.

18:06.788 --> 18:08.221
See, I told you, Oscar.

18:08.222 --> 18:09.589
You should have listened to me.

18:09.590 --> 18:11.558
Well, that's what Dani and Emily did.

18:11.559 --> 18:14.094
And a minor disagreement got blown

18:14.095 --> 18:15.529
way out of proportion.

18:15.530 --> 18:18.665
Aha! You should have listened to me!

18:18.666 --> 18:20.901
No one should listen to you.

18:20.902 --> 18:22.502
Yeah, Oscar.

18:22.503 --> 18:24.104
You almost wrecked my marriage.

18:24.105 --> 18:25.572
DANI: Yeah, and thanks to Felix,

18:25.573 --> 18:29.342
I was almost sleeping in
the back of a Chevy Vega.

18:29.343 --> 18:31.143
It got dark so fast.

18:32.112 --> 18:34.014
Great job, Felix.

18:34.015 --> 18:35.715
DIANE: Let's get out
of here, Teddy-bear.

18:35.716 --> 18:37.918
Yeah, Teddy-bear wants some honey.

18:37.919 --> 18:38.884
Ugh.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.122
We should go, too, roomie.

18:42.123 --> 18:43.786
<i>Tiny House Hunters</i>
starts in five minutes.

18:43.787 --> 18:46.788
Ooh! I love it when
they hit their heads.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.601
Oscar, are we bad people?

18:56.636 --> 18:58.939
We're not great.

18:58.940 --> 19:02.475
Look, you're not bad people.

19:02.476 --> 19:04.244
You had good intentions.

19:04.245 --> 19:06.146
Yeah, but if I had listened to Felix,

19:06.147 --> 19:08.490
then Teddy wouldn't have gotten
himself in so much trouble.

19:08.491 --> 19:11.084
And if I had listened to Oscar,
Emily and Dani would be fine.

19:11.085 --> 19:12.719
Interesting.

19:12.720 --> 19:15.956
You know, it seems to
me that individually,

19:15.957 --> 19:19.759
the two of you are sources of
a lot of conflict and chaos.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.061
But together...

19:21.062 --> 19:24.497
We make each other better!

19:24.498 --> 19:28.033
I was going to say you
cancel each other out.

19:30.437 --> 19:32.906
Which makes us better.

19:32.907 --> 19:34.808
Sure, why not?

19:34.809 --> 19:37.310
You are cured.

19:37.311 --> 19:39.880
I declare you both mentally healthy.

19:39.881 --> 19:42.648
I see no future problems here.

19:46.052 --> 19:47.921
See? We're great!

19:47.922 --> 19:49.422
And a good match.

19:49.423 --> 19:52.025
And that is why I would
like to officially choose you

19:52.026 --> 19:53.326
as my roommate.

19:53.327 --> 19:56.196
Will you move back in and cancel me out?

19:56.197 --> 19:58.865
I would be honored.

19:58.866 --> 20:00.533
Welcome home, buddy.

20:00.534 --> 20:01.768
Thank you.

20:01.769 --> 20:03.450
Now I'm gonna need you
to clear out of here

20:03.451 --> 20:05.154
for a few hours while
I shampoo the carpet.

20:05.155 --> 20:07.040
Lot of foot traffic in here today!

20:13.710 --> 20:14.744
Oscar, don't sulk.

20:14.745 --> 20:17.114
You can push the button next time.

20:17.115 --> 20:20.484
That's what you said last time.

20:20.485 --> 20:22.018
Hold the elevator!

20:22.019 --> 20:24.558
Dr. Goldman!

20:24.559 --> 20:26.192
Oh, boy.

20:31.025 --> 20:32.385
I am so glad that we ran into you.

20:32.386 --> 20:34.633
I've been going over my notes
from yesterday's session,

20:34.634 --> 20:38.005
and I have a host of
observations to share with you.

20:38.006 --> 20:39.940
You know, my schedule's pretty tight.

20:39.941 --> 20:41.108
See, Dr. Goldman?

20:41.109 --> 20:43.210
This is what I have
to deal with every day.

20:43.211 --> 20:44.545
He's compulsive, right?

20:44.546 --> 20:46.447
Is there a pill he can take for that,

20:46.448 --> 20:48.516
or a really painful injection?

20:48.517 --> 20:50.283
Oh, this is me.

20:51.519 --> 20:52.386
Four?

20:52.387 --> 20:54.221
I thought you lived on 14.

20:54.222 --> 20:56.857
I do, but I read an article called,

20:56.858 --> 21:01.327
"Ten Flights a Day Gives You
the Glutes You Want, Yay!"

21:02.163 --> 21:04.230
Oh, God, I've got to move.

21:06.267 --> 21:08.803
That was rude of her to walk
out on our session like that.

21:08.804 --> 21:10.336
I concur.

21:12.226 --> 21:19.826
