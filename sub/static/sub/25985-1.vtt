01:39.186 --> 01:42.034
...Britain's most rare songbirds,

01:42.058 --> 01:44.452
such as the bearded tit.

02:43.293 --> 02:45.053
Hey, where are you?

02:45.077 --> 02:46.229
Didn't you get my text?

02:46.253 --> 02:47.752
One of the locals reported
a sighting

02:47.776 --> 02:49.145
of the bearded tit,

02:49.169 --> 02:50.885
so we thought, if we went
into the woods now,

02:50.909 --> 02:53.061
there's a good chance we
may spot it for ourselves.

02:53.085 --> 02:54.367
Oh, I made dinner.

02:54.391 --> 02:55.716
Oh, I'm sorry, darling.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.283
I didn't think we were doing
anything special,

02:57.307 --> 02:58.980
so I headed straight out
from the office.

02:59.004 --> 03:00.417
Perhaps you could put it
in the fridge.

03:00.441 --> 03:02.332
We can have it tomorrow night?

03:02.356 --> 03:04.203
Well, it's your birthday.

03:04.227 --> 03:05.726
You should do what you want.

03:05.750 --> 03:08.251
So go off and find
those tits, then.

03:08.275 --> 03:10.470
Thanks for understanding,
darling.

03:10.494 --> 03:11.713
Oh, don't wait up.

03:22.854 --> 03:24.702
You were joking, weren't you?

03:24.726 --> 03:26.182
You're in the driveway.
Well, that's taken care of.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.748
Poppy's so naive.

03:27.772 --> 03:29.141
Her idea of a wild night

03:29.165 --> 03:30.621
is a medium-rare steak dinner.
Hello.

03:30.645 --> 03:32.275
Stephen, are you there?
Can you hear me?

03:32.299 --> 03:33.972
She thinks I'm bird watching,

03:33.996 --> 03:36.017
so I think I can get away
with staying the night.

03:36.041 --> 03:38.498
Ooh, I know a
few things we could do

03:38.522 --> 03:40.283
that will last all night.

03:40.307 --> 03:42.067
Handcuffs again?

03:42.091 --> 03:43.503
Come here and I'll show you.

03:43.527 --> 03:45.026
That's what I love about you.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.419
So adventurous.

03:46.443 --> 03:47.638
You naughty girl.

04:34.883 --> 04:36.730
How about wanker of the year?

04:36.754 --> 04:38.036
I worked really hard for that.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.280
And I worked way too hard
for this.

04:41.237 --> 04:42.954
Poppy!

Poppy!

04:59.908 --> 05:01.494

05:01.518 --> 05:03.670
It's raining
and I'm getting soaked.

05:04.695 --> 05:06.630
Poppy, I'm locked out.

05:06.654 --> 05:09.309
You know how my hair goes
curly in the rain.

05:11.093 --> 05:12.897
Poppy, for God's sake,

05:12.921 --> 05:14.507
be an adult about this.

05:16.359 --> 05:18.337
Hey, princess.
It's Justin.

05:18.361 --> 05:20.078
Pick up if you're there.

05:20.102 --> 05:21.732
I'm sitting by the pool
with a margarita

05:21.756 --> 05:23.081
thinking it's about time

05:23.105 --> 05:24.909
you came out to L.A. to visit.

05:24.933 --> 05:26.476
I miss you.
Bye, sweetie.

05:26.500 --> 05:27.999
Oh, and happy birthday, Stephen,

05:28.023 --> 05:29.392
you handsome devil.

05:29.416 --> 05:31.524
Poppy.

05:31.548 --> 05:33.657
George Clooney
and fluffy animals?

05:33.681 --> 05:34.962
Yes, George Clooney

05:34.986 --> 05:37.008
visited a Los Angeles
animal shelter

05:37.032 --> 05:39.402
over the weekend
to adopt a rescue dog.

05:39.426 --> 05:40.751
And the generous star

05:40.775 --> 05:42.405
...made sure he
and his new canine pal

05:42.429 --> 05:44.494
hit it off right away
by, get this,

05:44.518 --> 05:46.931
rubbing meatballs on his shoes.

05:46.955 --> 05:48.019
Not surprisingly,

05:48.043 --> 05:49.412
the pair bonded immediately

05:49.436 --> 05:51.196
and have been inseparable since.

05:51.220 --> 05:53.241
This guy just gets
nicer and nicer.

05:53.265 --> 05:54.721
Much like myself Ashley.

05:56.051 --> 05:57.202
The renowned bachelor

05:57.226 --> 05:58.421
is at home in L.A.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.118
promoting his next movie,

06:00.142 --> 06:01.293
and we'll have a sneak peak

06:01.317 --> 06:03.687
on tomorrow's show.

I'm going to find George,

Poppy.
Justin.

07:25.227 --> 07:27.161
Finally, after all these years,

07:27.185 --> 07:29.207
you come visit.
Look at you.

07:29.231 --> 07:30.817
Oh, don't.
I look terrible.

07:30.841 --> 07:32.036
Nothing that a week's sleep

07:32.060 --> 07:33.341
and a makeover can't fix.

07:33.365 --> 07:35.193
Leave the bags.
I'll get them later.

07:36.064 --> 07:38.042
Wow, this is sexy.

07:38.066 --> 07:39.043
Yep.

07:39.067 --> 07:41.088
Oh, and this is Irina.

07:41.112 --> 07:42.568
She helps me out
around the house.

07:42.592 --> 07:44.831
Irina, this is my friend
from England

07:44.855 --> 07:46.180
I was telling you about.

07:46.204 --> 07:48.008
Planned her wedding
when I lived there,

07:48.032 --> 07:50.271
ooh, too many years ago.

07:50.295 --> 07:51.664
We bonded over karaoke

07:51.688 --> 07:54.275
and our mutual love of
power ballads from the '80s.

07:54.299 --> 07:56.060
So why you leave your husband?

07:56.084 --> 07:57.714
He no good at the sex?

07:57.738 --> 07:59.411
Irina.

07:59.435 --> 08:02.849
Actually, it turns out
he was good at the sex,

08:02.873 --> 08:04.198
just not with me.

08:04.222 --> 08:06.374
You need love
of good Russian man.

08:06.398 --> 08:08.159
You will meet my friend Anton.

08:08.183 --> 08:09.682
He show you good time.

08:09.706 --> 08:11.989
Thanks, Irina,
but I think Poppy's good.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.860
Maybe you should meet Anton.

08:15.103 --> 08:18.474
Oh, I've not seen
this photo in years.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.259
Sorry, I should've taken
that down.

08:21.283 --> 08:24.218
Although I do love the way
my cheekbones look.

08:24.242 --> 08:25.959
The photographer thought
you'd had a stroke,

08:25.983 --> 08:28.658
and the guests kept referring
to you as my "special friend."

08:28.682 --> 08:33.010
I'm not sure why you had to try out
a new smile in my wedding photos.

08:33.034 --> 08:34.924
I thought it was a winner.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.841
So are we your first divorce?

08:37.865 --> 08:39.799
At least you made it
down the aisle.

08:39.823 --> 08:41.496
I spent six months last year

08:41.520 --> 08:44.804
working on the most amazing
Black Swan-themed wedding,

08:44.828 --> 08:46.153
and the bride
didn't even show up.

08:46.177 --> 08:48.068
Probably had the right idea.

08:48.092 --> 08:50.007
Oh, don't say that.

08:52.053 --> 08:53.987
And you never suspected a thing?

08:54.011 --> 08:57.861
Well, he'd recently taken up
bird watching.

08:57.885 --> 08:59.645
Bird watching.

08:59.669 --> 09:01.125
Exactly.

09:01.149 --> 09:03.214
Especially as he has
a feather phobia.

09:04.805 --> 09:06.826
Sorry, hold on.

09:06.850 --> 09:08.175
It's my boss.

09:08.199 --> 09:09.873
She's texted me ten times

09:09.897 --> 09:11.657
in the past 30 minutes.

09:11.681 --> 09:13.006
God forbid I have a night off.

09:13.030 --> 09:14.834
When are you going to start up
on your own again?

09:14.858 --> 09:15.879
You've been talking
about it forever.

09:15.903 --> 09:17.576
I know. I know.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.970
Paolo was always saying
the same thing to me.

09:19.994 --> 09:24.235
Why exactly did you
and Paolo break up?

09:24.259 --> 09:25.976
I don't want to talk about it.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.437
It's just too painful to relive.

09:30.744 --> 09:32.809
He cheated on me.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.985
Okay, fine,
maybe I cheated on him first,

09:35.009 --> 09:38.075
but he should've been the
bigger person and forgiven me

09:38.099 --> 09:39.598
instead of being like me

09:39.622 --> 09:41.339
and betraying me.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.167
Anyway, we're talking
about me again.

09:43.191 --> 09:44.342
Let's talk about you.

09:44.366 --> 09:46.518
I should've seen it coming,

09:46.542 --> 09:48.651
all those late nights
at the office,

09:48.675 --> 09:50.217
lack of romance,

09:50.241 --> 09:52.219
not to mention sex.

09:52.243 --> 09:54.115
It's all such a big mess.

09:55.551 --> 09:58.356
Hey, I know a great therapist.

09:58.380 --> 10:01.359
She's relationship expert
to the stars.

10:01.383 --> 10:03.013
Maybe you should go see her.

10:03.037 --> 10:04.101
I'll be fine.

10:04.125 --> 10:05.692
I'm only here two weeks.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.565
Which stars?

10:14.396 --> 10:17.201
Yeah, yeah, he just left,

10:17.225 --> 10:20.204
Believe it or not

10:20.228 --> 10:23.207
He's back with her.
I know.

10:23.231 --> 10:24.469
Hold on a sec.

10:24.493 --> 10:27.080
Hi, I'm Poppy Wakefield here
to see Dr. Faye.

10:27.104 --> 10:29.779
Poppy. Weird name, huh?

10:31.065 --> 10:32.869
Fill out these forms.

10:32.893 --> 10:35.069
Just make sure they're signed.

10:37.245 --> 10:38.701
Anita, are you still there?

10:38.725 --> 10:43.575
Okay, guess who just called
to make another appointment?

10:43.599 --> 10:46.230
No. No.

10:46.254 --> 10:47.753
Who's that?

10:47.777 --> 10:50.887
Uh, no. Yeah. Yeah.

10:50.911 --> 10:52.236
Charming though he is,

10:52.260 --> 10:54.281
he can't seem
to hold down a woman.

10:54.305 --> 10:57.894
Dr. Faye's working
on his commitment issues.

10:57.918 --> 10:59.722
I'm like, "I'll take him
issues and all."

10:59.746 --> 11:01.375
He can hold me down.

11:01.399 --> 11:03.271
Oh... Oh, hold on a sec.

11:04.881 --> 11:06.685
Yes, doctor?

11:06.709 --> 11:08.015
I'll let her know.

11:09.712 --> 11:12.082
Poppy, Dr. Faye
will see you now.

11:12.106 --> 11:13.910
Thanks.

11:13.934 --> 11:15.389
Just out of curiosity,

11:15.413 --> 11:16.869
I couldn't help but overhear.

11:16.893 --> 11:18.001
Who were you talking about?

11:18.025 --> 11:19.524
I couldn't possibly say.

11:19.548 --> 11:22.919
That would be a breach
of client confidentiality.

11:22.943 --> 11:25.530
Of course.

11:25.554 --> 11:31.841
Anita? Okay, so you'll never guess
who just had a vaginaplasty.

11:31.865 --> 11:35.583
Tell me, when did your obsession
with celebrity begin?

11:35.607 --> 11:37.760
I'm not obsessed with celebrity.

11:37.784 --> 11:41.633
So this is
a Clooney-specific obsession.

11:41.657 --> 11:44.723
I'm not obsessed.

11:44.747 --> 11:47.595
I mean, who
doesn't love George Clooney?

11:47.619 --> 11:49.032
I'll never forget the first time

11:49.056 --> 11:50.860
I saw those big brown eyes

11:50.884 --> 11:52.122
and winning smile.

11:52.146 --> 11:53.713
So handsome.

11:54.888 --> 11:57.867
He's a good guy who really
cares about the world.

11:57.891 --> 11:59.782
Funny, smart.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.479
Why wouldn't I be able
to date him?

12:01.503 --> 12:04.612
Cries you and 50 million
other women.

12:04.636 --> 12:06.508
Have you ever met George?

12:09.946 --> 12:11.184
Is that a yes?

12:11.208 --> 12:12.732
I think that's a yes!

12:20.348 --> 12:22.369
Morning, sweetie.
Whatcha doing?

12:22.393 --> 12:23.196
Working.

12:23.220 --> 12:24.850
This article's due tomorrow.

12:24.874 --> 12:27.635
Does Women's Chitchat Magazine
know you're here?

12:27.659 --> 12:28.898
No, it shouldn't matter.

12:28.922 --> 12:30.987
I do most of my work
from home now anyway.

12:31.011 --> 12:32.597
So what's this week's story?

12:32.621 --> 12:34.991
"My Husband Left Me
For My Dog."

12:35.015 --> 12:38.734
No, it's about a woman trying to
get over the death of her father.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.474
She turned to bananas
to help her.

12:40.498 --> 12:41.954
Bananas?

12:41.978 --> 12:44.652
Does the potassium help with
the depression or something?

12:44.676 --> 12:47.394
She collects those little
stickers that are on them.

12:47.418 --> 12:48.744
Bananas were her dad's
favorite food.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.746
It's actually
really heart-wrenching.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.051
It's actually really lame.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.227
Oh, Stephen.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.012
I don't want to talk to him.

12:56.036 --> 12:57.665
Okay, stop what you're doing.

12:57.689 --> 12:59.015
I'm going to take you out.

12:59.039 --> 13:00.538
We're going to the Farmers
Market, you'll love it.

13:00.562 --> 13:02.018
You're wooing me
with fruits and veggies?

13:02.042 --> 13:03.541
Yep, so get dressed.

13:03.565 --> 13:06.196
I'm just going to stay here
and get this out of the way.

13:06.220 --> 13:08.589
Suit yourself. Although going
to the Farmers Market

13:08.613 --> 13:10.156
is like an L.A. staple.

13:10.180 --> 13:11.505
Plus I see the best sightings.

13:11.529 --> 13:13.377
I saw George Clooney there
last week,

13:13.401 --> 13:15.727
and he walked by,
and I was like,

13:15.751 --> 13:17.860
"Does George Clooney want me
to say, 'Hey, George Clooney,

13:17.884 --> 13:19.035
Doug Ross, ER, thumbs up, '

13:19.059 --> 13:20.210
like does he want me"...

13:20.234 --> 13:23.280
Decided to come after all.

13:51.395 --> 13:55.375
Poppy, this juice is like
an enema in a cup.

13:55.399 --> 13:57.551
Nothing says breakfast
like an enema.

13:57.575 --> 13:58.901
Now, I put a little bit
of honey in there

13:58.925 --> 14:00.076
so you get a sweet aftertaste.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.251
Here, why don't you try
my latest...

14:01.275 --> 14:02.556
Oh, no, I'm fine.
Thank you.

14:02.580 --> 14:04.167
Oh, an Aussie.

14:04.191 --> 14:05.690
I always wanted to visit

14:05.714 --> 14:07.170
the land down under.

14:07.194 --> 14:08.562
That's very good,
but I'm English,

14:08.586 --> 14:09.520
not Australian.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.043
Ah, they all sound
the same, huh?

14:11.067 --> 14:13.785
You know, I always wanted
to scuba the Great Barrier Reef

14:13.809 --> 14:17.658
and meditate below the equator.

14:17.682 --> 14:19.486
You should do that.

14:19.510 --> 14:21.749
Am I tasting hints of fennel?

14:21.773 --> 14:23.142
Yeah, with fresh rhubarb.

14:23.166 --> 14:26.406
Listen, I know you don't wanna
try my juice, but...

14:26.430 --> 14:28.408
maybe a spot of tea, 'ey?

14:28.432 --> 14:31.498
You can't possibly think
that's what I sound like.

14:31.522 --> 14:32.673
You are really cute.

14:32.697 --> 14:33.849
No, I'm not.

14:33.873 --> 14:34.850
Yeah.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.156
Thank you.

14:37.180 --> 14:40.638
Look, why don't you try
my ginger passion iced tea?

14:40.662 --> 14:42.988
It's got fresh mint leaves and ginger.
It's for digestion.

14:43.012 --> 14:46.146
And has passion for...

14:47.016 --> 14:48.452
uh, well, you know.

14:49.627 --> 14:50.996
No, I... I'm Marrie... uh.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.911
Oh, well, it's nice
to meet you, Mary.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.739
That's him.
Oh, my God, look.

14:54.763 --> 14:56.112
Look, it's him.

15:03.163 --> 15:05.054
You don't like my tea.

15:05.078 --> 15:06.882
I like your tea.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.319
Bye, Mary.

15:09.343 --> 15:10.494
Bye.

15:10.518 --> 15:12.148
So I might not have seen
George that time,

15:12.172 --> 15:13.845
but I still just have
this feeling

15:13.869 --> 15:14.977
that we're going to meet.

15:15.001 --> 15:17.196
Isn't he in a relationship?

15:17.220 --> 15:19.590
He's always in a relationship.

15:19.614 --> 15:21.984
But it's not like he's married
or anything.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.681
I mean, he's 52?

15:23.705 --> 15:25.770
I think if he was going
to settle down again,

15:25.794 --> 15:27.685
he would've done it by now.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.513
The eternal bachelor.

15:29.537 --> 15:31.713
Maybe he just hasn't found
the right one.

15:33.236 --> 15:35.693
I just feel a connection.

15:35.717 --> 15:38.285
But you've never met him.

15:40.026 --> 15:41.699
What about dating sites?

15:41.723 --> 15:42.743
People have connections there,

15:42.767 --> 15:43.875
and they've never met.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.529
And then they murder you.

15:45.553 --> 15:47.400
Wow, she must've had

15:47.424 --> 15:50.577
some pretty bad
dating experiences.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.971
Celebrities get put
on these pedestals,

15:52.995 --> 15:54.451
but they're only people.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.366
It's not out of the realms
of possibility

15:56.390 --> 15:58.020
that if we met, we'd hit it off.

15:58.044 --> 16:02.657
Maybe I just need to give fate
a helping hand.

16:06.008 --> 16:10.815
Wow, Poppy, a bottle of wine to say thank
you for letting me stay would be fine,

16:10.839 --> 16:13.122
but thanks, I'll take them all.

16:13.146 --> 16:15.646
Casamigos... isn't that
George Clooney's tequila?

16:15.670 --> 16:17.213
Well, I'm doing
an article on it,

16:17.237 --> 16:18.823
so I got it for research.

16:18.847 --> 16:20.477
You are not.

16:20.501 --> 16:22.827
Oh, yeah?

16:24.722 --> 16:25.699
Yeah, hi,

16:25.723 --> 16:27.049
I'm calling to cover

16:27.073 --> 16:28.659
the next Casamigos
tequila event in L.A.

16:30.206 --> 16:33.838
Yes, I write for the
prestigious U.K. publication,

16:33.862 --> 16:35.753
Women's Chitchat.

16:35.777 --> 16:38.756
It's a highbrow magazine.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.932
And they're really keen
for me to cover the event.

16:40.956 --> 16:42.760
Possibly get an interview
with George Clooney

16:42.784 --> 16:46.024
about why he wanted
to develop his own tequila?

16:46.048 --> 16:48.157
Right, okay.
Well, no problem.

16:48.181 --> 16:50.072
I'll try you again.

16:50.096 --> 16:51.421
Tomorrow.

16:51.445 --> 16:52.750
It's good.

16:58.408 --> 17:00.734
George Clooney
has been seen out and about

17:00.758 --> 17:01.997
hitting the road in L.A.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.347
on his beloved Harley Davidson.

17:04.371 --> 17:05.869
Yes, he's fast on the road...

17:10.333 --> 17:13.095
My one Friday off in weeks,
and you bring me here.

17:13.118 --> 17:14.574
I know you're a tourist and all,

17:14.598 --> 17:16.881
but this is
a really random request.

17:16.905 --> 17:18.970
I know.
This is my treat.

17:18.993 --> 17:21.451
I would've worn my chaps if
you'd given me the heads up.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.453
We look slightly out of place.

17:23.477 --> 17:25.281
We fit in just fine.

17:25.305 --> 17:27.457
Hello.

17:27.481 --> 17:29.111
I do have to say
I'm proud of you

17:29.135 --> 17:31.113
for breaking out
of your comfort zone.

17:31.137 --> 17:32.853
Haven't seen you
this loosened up

17:32.877 --> 17:34.464
since you were wasted
on tequila shots

17:34.488 --> 17:37.554
and ripping your shirt off
singing "Take My Breath Away."

17:37.578 --> 17:39.121
Stephen was mad at me for that.

17:39.145 --> 17:41.819
Apparently I didn't take
his breath away.

17:41.843 --> 17:44.082
Look at the photos on the wall.

17:44.106 --> 17:45.431
Those must be the regulars.

17:45.455 --> 17:48.652
John Travolta, Hugh Jackman,

17:48.676 --> 17:50.132
George Clooney.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.785
Oh, really?

17:52.810 --> 17:54.247
Hey, George.

17:59.165 --> 18:02.057
Do you have
a specialty cocktail list?

18:02.081 --> 18:04.059
Poppy.
Hi, Sharon.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.017
Were you going to tell me
you were skipping town?

18:06.041 --> 18:07.627
How did you find out?

18:07.651 --> 18:10.717
Someone called
the office from...

18:10.741 --> 18:12.980
Casamigos Tequila,

18:13.004 --> 18:15.026
saying that
one of our journalists

18:15.050 --> 18:16.810
wanted to cover
their party in L.A.

18:16.834 --> 18:19.161
They called?
What did you say?

18:19.185 --> 18:21.467
I told them we're
a bloody woman's magazine.

18:21.491 --> 18:24.557
Why the hell would we be
covering a tequila event?

18:24.581 --> 18:25.689
I just thought it would be...

18:25.713 --> 18:27.647
I heard about you and Stephen.

18:27.671 --> 18:28.866
Who told you?

18:28.890 --> 18:30.998
He came here looking for you.

18:31.022 --> 18:33.871
Look, I don't want this
to bleed into your work.

18:33.895 --> 18:36.569
Keep your personal life
personal,

18:36.593 --> 18:38.726
and don't turn
into a bitter Betty.

18:41.032 --> 18:43.228
I'm not bitter.
Really?

18:43.252 --> 18:44.882
You should be.

18:44.906 --> 18:48.190
I'd be so pissed if my husband
cheated on me with the nanny.

18:48.214 --> 18:49.452
It wasn't the nanny.

18:49.476 --> 18:51.932
We don't have a nan...
We don't even have kids.

18:51.956 --> 18:54.500
Oh, I... I just assumed.

18:54.524 --> 18:56.763
Maybe it's different in England.

18:56.787 --> 18:59.549
Here it's always the nanny.

18:59.573 --> 19:02.769
Okay, maybe our marriage hasn't
been that exciting lately.

19:02.793 --> 19:06.251
Unless you count
Stephen discovering nose hair trimmers.

19:06.275 --> 19:08.601
And how long have you felt
like this?

19:08.625 --> 19:10.081
I don't know exactly.

19:10.105 --> 19:11.996
Just seems
that everything's changed.

19:12.020 --> 19:15.739
Even the coffee shop started
putting two shots in the lattes.

19:15.763 --> 19:17.262
Just got increasingly bitter.

19:17.286 --> 19:19.656
Your relationship
with your husband.

19:19.680 --> 19:22.485
No, the coffee.

19:22.509 --> 19:25.381
So what do you do when you realize
the coffee tastes bitter?

19:26.643 --> 19:27.794
Change your coffee shop.

19:27.818 --> 19:28.795
Exactly.

19:28.819 --> 19:30.449
That's what I'm doing.

19:30.473 --> 19:33.148
I'm changing my coffee shop.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.695
Metaphorically.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.633
It's me again.

19:40.657 --> 19:44.095
I know I made a mistake.
Will you at least hear me?

19:45.314 --> 19:46.552
You okay?

19:46.576 --> 19:48.380
Mm-hmm.

19:48.404 --> 19:50.861
It's going to be weird
to go back, huh?

19:50.885 --> 19:52.887
Yeah.

19:55.150 --> 19:58.825
Sally.
Tell her hello for me.

19:58.849 --> 20:01.088
You've come out of hiding.

20:01.112 --> 20:02.655
We're all worried
about you, Poppy.

20:02.679 --> 20:03.656
Well, you shouldn't be.

20:03.680 --> 20:04.962
I'm fine.

20:04.986 --> 20:06.529
Justin's taking
great care of me.

20:06.553 --> 20:07.921
Hi, Sally.
Been too long.

20:07.945 --> 20:09.488
Hi, Justin.

20:09.512 --> 20:12.099
Will you please tell my sister
that running away

20:12.123 --> 20:13.579
isn't how you make
a marriage work.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.494
Oh, sorry, my conscience
is calling me.

20:15.518 --> 20:17.192
Hello?

20:17.216 --> 20:19.890
Well, neither is creating
an elaborate bird watching hobby

20:19.914 --> 20:21.500
as a cover for an affair.

20:21.524 --> 20:23.023
It wasn't his finest moment.

20:23.047 --> 20:24.808
Ironically, it was.

20:24.832 --> 20:26.592
It's the most exciting thing
he's done in years.

20:26.616 --> 20:29.116
I'm just saying...
12 years of marriage.

20:29.140 --> 20:30.901
Is this really the end?

20:30.925 --> 20:33.033
At least let him pick you up
from the airport.

20:33.057 --> 20:34.644
I'm not sure I'm ready to leave.

20:34.668 --> 20:36.298
Poppy, you've had
your adventure.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.517
Now it's time to return
to real life.

20:38.541 --> 20:39.779
This isn't you.

20:39.803 --> 20:41.303
How do you know?

20:41.327 --> 20:44.697
You're predictable.

20:44.721 --> 20:48.005
I'm sorry. I can't hear you.
The connection's terrible.

20:48.029 --> 20:49.963
I said it's time to come home.

20:49.987 --> 20:51.313
Still can't hear you.
Poppy.

20:51.337 --> 20:53.489
Please let everyone know
I'm extending my trip.

20:53.513 --> 20:55.186
Poppy...

20:55.210 --> 20:56.840
Okay, seriously,

20:56.864 --> 20:58.494
I know she's your sister,

20:58.518 --> 21:01.192
but I was ready to smack her.

21:01.216 --> 21:02.672
You sure I can stay?

21:02.696 --> 21:04.891
Yes, I like having you here,

21:04.915 --> 21:07.111
but we gotta get you
some friends.

21:07.135 --> 21:08.852
The Black Swan-wedding
is back on,

21:08.876 --> 21:11.115
and my schedule
is going to be cray-cray.

21:11.139 --> 21:14.031
I know! You should meet
Marcy Campbell.

21:14.055 --> 21:16.555
She's from Texas
and new in town.

21:16.579 --> 21:17.687
I did her wedding.

21:17.711 --> 21:19.732
She's real fun, heart of gold,

21:19.756 --> 21:21.865
but she just hasn't met
anyone here yet.

21:21.889 --> 21:24.152
You two will hit it off.

21:34.380 --> 21:35.705
Poppy Wakefield.

21:35.729 --> 21:37.924
It's so lovely to meet you,
Marcy.

21:37.948 --> 21:42.233
I love the British accent.

21:42.257 --> 21:43.887
So darlin'.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.584
Say something in British.

21:45.608 --> 21:49.153
Um, Justin said
you moved here recently.

21:49.177 --> 21:51.242
I love it.

21:51.266 --> 21:52.243
So...

21:52.267 --> 21:54.289
...proper.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.116
Have you been to Downton Abbey?

22:00.710 --> 22:03.278
N-No, it's not a real place.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.391
So Justin tells me you're
having a Thelma & Louise-moment?

22:09.415 --> 22:12.089
No, did he?
Honey, we all go through those.

22:12.113 --> 22:15.397
Since the big move, I've been tempted
to just pack up the car and...

22:15.421 --> 22:16.746
Drive off a cliff?

22:16.770 --> 22:18.748
I was gonna say have me
a girly road trip,

22:18.772 --> 22:21.011
but there's days
I wanna do that, too.

22:21.035 --> 22:23.666
Preferably running over
Jerry's body on the way,

22:23.690 --> 22:25.842
but that's marriage for ya.

22:25.866 --> 22:27.278
How long have you been married?

22:27.302 --> 22:28.303
Coming up...

22:31.393 --> 22:32.960
Four months.

22:40.054 --> 22:42.685
I'm so thrilled
Justin set us up.

22:42.709 --> 22:44.382
I met a couple of people
at spin,

22:44.406 --> 22:46.950
but they were too clean living
for my likin'.

22:46.974 --> 22:49.605
I mean, I never trust
a person who doesn't drink.

22:49.629 --> 22:50.736
I just don't.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.371
Me neither.

22:56.157 --> 22:58.309
L.A. is such
a transient town.

22:58.333 --> 23:00.355
Doesn't help when you're
trying to make friends.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.443
But you've got Jerry.

23:01.467 --> 23:03.140
Who?

23:03.164 --> 23:05.795
I only see him when we got some
partners' dinner to attend.

23:05.819 --> 23:08.537
I know it well. The "Honey, I'm
meeting someone important tonight,

23:08.561 --> 23:11.888
so put on a nice dress and tell the
story of how we met" kind of nights?

23:11.912 --> 23:15.021
Oh, my gosh, you too?

23:15.045 --> 23:17.981
Actually we're
hosting something next week.

23:18.005 --> 23:21.158
Some political fundraiser
thing, I lose track.

23:21.182 --> 23:23.029
That famous Austrian chef
is doing the catering,

23:23.053 --> 23:24.466
and apparently the governor

23:24.490 --> 23:26.163
and George Clooney are coming.

23:26.187 --> 23:27.773
I mean, in between
my bouts of fainting,

23:27.797 --> 23:29.079
what am I supposed to say to...

23:29.103 --> 23:31.386
George Clooney
is attending a party

23:31.410 --> 23:32.474
that you're hosting?

23:32.498 --> 23:33.475
Next week!

23:33.499 --> 23:35.128
Oh, I'm a Texas girl.

23:35.152 --> 23:37.348
I got a big mouth and big hair,

23:37.372 --> 23:40.003
but not the biggest knowledge
of what's going on in the world.

23:40.027 --> 23:43.876
How the heck am I gonna play host
to movie stars, politicians?

23:43.900 --> 23:45.835
Marcy, you've got to invite me.

23:45.859 --> 23:47.619
You've just got to.

23:47.643 --> 23:50.883
I've got years of experience accompanying
Stephen to business dinners.

23:50.907 --> 23:52.798
I could help you
with what to say.

23:52.822 --> 23:55.366
You'd come?
It's next Wednesday.

23:55.390 --> 23:57.760
Oh, I'll have to check my
sched... of course I'll come.

23:57.784 --> 23:59.414
Oh, Poppy,

23:59.438 --> 24:00.980
I feel like it's fate we met.

24:01.004 --> 24:03.548
I feel it absolutely
most definitely is.

24:12.015 --> 24:13.515
I might've played this moment

24:13.539 --> 24:15.081
over and over again in my mind,

24:15.105 --> 24:16.866
but I never thought
of this one last hurdle.

24:16.890 --> 24:19.564
What does one wear when meeting
the destined love of one's life?

24:19.588 --> 24:21.087
Poppy, calm down, okay?

24:21.111 --> 24:24.090
I mean, if I hear about you
on TMZ next week,

24:24.114 --> 24:25.831
I'll know you didn't
heed my advice

24:25.855 --> 24:30.183
about not setting unrealistically
high expectations.

24:30.207 --> 24:31.707
What? I might be on TV

24:31.731 --> 24:33.448
and meet George Clooney?

24:33.472 --> 24:34.666
What's unrealistic?

24:34.690 --> 24:36.015
All I expect is
a chance encounter

24:36.039 --> 24:37.234
with the man of my dreams,

24:37.258 --> 24:39.695
and him finding out
I'm the woman of his.

24:40.479 --> 24:41.871
Exactly.

24:46.702 --> 24:49.096
Marcy, I need your help.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.032
This is nice.

24:53.056 --> 24:54.033

26:01.995 --> 26:03.494
I left my keys

26:03.518 --> 26:04.495

26:04.519 --> 26:05.496
I'm not at home.

26:05.520 --> 26:06.715
I'm still at the florist

26:06.739 --> 26:08.499
with Bosszilla
and a couple of swans.

26:08.523 --> 26:10.632
Justin, I've got to
get ready for the party.

26:10.656 --> 26:11.807
I've only got two hours.

26:11.831 --> 26:13.243
And I have to work.

26:13.267 --> 26:14.331
I can't just leave.

26:14.355 --> 26:15.854
It's George Clooney.

26:15.878 --> 26:17.639
Look, Justin.
I'm sorry to be a pain, but...

26:17.663 --> 26:20.990
Honey, I love you,
and, boy, do I love him,

26:21.014 --> 26:23.645
but unless you're gonna get
George to fund my own company,

26:23.669 --> 26:25.995
you have as much a chance
as he did in space

26:26.019 --> 26:28.519
to get me to come home.
I'll call the landlord.

26:28.543 --> 26:31.677
Good night and good luck.

26:49.259 --> 26:50.628
Is he coming?

26:50.652 --> 26:52.195
It's me.
Please don't hang up.

26:52.219 --> 26:53.109
We need to talk.

26:53.133 --> 26:54.371
I've got nothing to say to you.

26:54.395 --> 26:56.025
I know. I know, Poppy,
I'm a fool.

26:56.049 --> 26:57.635
I just... I just think
that our marriage

26:57.659 --> 26:59.419
hasn't really been spicy
for years.

26:59.443 --> 27:01.204
And then this woman came along and I...
What?

27:01.228 --> 27:04.120
I don't have time for
this right now, Stephen.

27:04.144 --> 27:05.643
You came!

27:05.667 --> 27:07.950
Of course the landlord
is out of town.

27:07.974 --> 27:11.127
I literally had to fake
diarrhea to come here.

27:11.151 --> 27:13.999
So, Cinderella,
we will get you to the ball.

I could really use your eye.

27:19.594 --> 27:23.182
Honey, this is already the longest
bathroom break in history.

27:23.206 --> 27:25.489
Believe me, if I could,
I would handcuff myself to you

27:25.513 --> 27:26.795

28:56.560 --> 28:59.191

I'm okay. I'm okay.

29:23.762 --> 29:24.826
It's all right. It's okay.

Everything's fine.
It's all good.

29:26.329 --> 29:27.176

29:27.200 --> 29:28.830
I'm okay.
It's all good.

29:28.854 --> 29:30.962
I just took a few too many
sleeping pills last night.

29:30.986 --> 29:32.355
You have a sleeping problem?

29:32.379 --> 29:34.705
I... I got a lot of anxiety.

29:34.729 --> 29:37.732
Yeah, I kinda know how you feel.

29:39.038 --> 29:40.493
Yeah, they took away
my driver's license.

29:40.517 --> 29:42.669
What?
Yeah, but I'm gonna work it out.

29:42.693 --> 29:44.323
It's all good.
It's all good.

29:44.347 --> 29:46.673
You're probably wondering
if the sleeping pills,

29:46.697 --> 29:48.023
you know, have worn off by now,

29:48.047 --> 29:49.676
which is probably,
usually the case,

29:49.700 --> 29:51.374
but I went to bed at 4:00 a.m.,

29:51.398 --> 29:53.550
took the sleeping pills,
and then, as soon as I got up,

29:53.574 --> 29:55.857
I smoked a couple of bowls, and
plus I'm heavily medicated anyway,

29:55.881 --> 29:57.162

it's gonna work out...

32:11.755 --> 32:13.516
but it's like looking
for George gives me a purpose,

32:13.540 --> 32:17.109
a reason not to think about
what's going on in my life.

32:18.588 --> 32:20.523
Do you think perhaps
focusing on George

32:20.547 --> 32:21.741
gives you a purpose,

32:21.765 --> 32:23.352
a reason not to think about

32:23.376 --> 32:25.963
the problems you're
experiencing with your husband?

32:25.987 --> 32:28.618
That's what I just said.

32:28.642 --> 32:30.533
How much am I paying this woman?

32:30.557 --> 32:31.708
Am I crazy?

32:31.732 --> 32:33.362
Well, the good news
is you're not crazy.

32:33.386 --> 32:36.017
I mean, who hasn't fantasized
about a dream life

32:36.041 --> 32:37.540
away from their own reality?

32:37.564 --> 32:39.890
I mean, after all, George.

32:39.914 --> 32:42.221
He's so sexy.
I'd fuck him.

32:43.744 --> 32:45.224
Who wouldn't?

32:59.238 --> 33:00.215
Hello?

33:00.239 --> 33:01.259
Hey, where are you?

33:01.283 --> 33:02.869
I thought you were going
to stay home

33:02.893 --> 33:04.480
to sign for the blood
for the vampire wedding.

33:04.504 --> 33:06.395
They just called and said
there was nobody home.

33:06.419 --> 33:07.483
The driver left.

33:07.507 --> 33:08.658
Sorry, I was still in bed.

33:08.682 --> 33:09.920
I didn't hear them ring.

33:09.944 --> 33:12.053
Seriously?
My boss is kicking my ass,

33:12.077 --> 33:13.576
and you're sleeping in again?

33:13.600 --> 33:14.838
I'm s-sorry.
I've just been...

33:14.862 --> 33:16.492
Miserable. I know.

33:16.516 --> 33:18.320
For days.
Over a party.

33:18.344 --> 33:20.409
Look. I'll make sure I'm here
the rest of the day

33:20.433 --> 33:22.019
if they can redeliver.
It's too late.

33:22.043 --> 33:23.847
I'm on my way to pick it up now.

33:23.871 --> 33:25.196
If I'm not there soon,

33:25.220 --> 33:26.893
it won't be fake blood
at the wedding.

33:26.917 --> 33:29.331
It'll be mine.

33:37.711 --> 33:40.081
Ugh, you no get up today?

33:40.105 --> 33:42.759
Go away.

33:44.413 --> 33:46.937
You got George Clooney
under there?

33:48.461 --> 33:49.438
Would I look like this

33:49.462 --> 33:50.613
if I had?

33:50.637 --> 33:53.094
And no, I'm not getting up today

33:53.118 --> 33:55.879
or tomorrow or ever again.

33:55.903 --> 33:57.533
Okay, I'll leave you.

33:57.557 --> 34:00.275
Irina, why is life so difficult?

34:00.299 --> 34:02.451
Why can't someone just give
you a map and directions?

34:02.475 --> 34:03.974
For Clooney?

34:03.998 --> 34:05.758
You buy star map on corner.

34:05.782 --> 34:07.412
No, like a manual for life.

34:07.436 --> 34:09.806
Wish that somebody could
just tell me what to do.

34:09.830 --> 34:11.764
You should see my friend,
Madam Nina.

34:11.788 --> 34:14.766
If she runs a brothel or something
weird, I'm not interested.

34:14.791 --> 34:17.596
She help you with map
and directions.

34:17.620 --> 34:20.251
She see things.
Universe.

34:20.275 --> 34:21.295
Like a psychic?

34:21.320 --> 34:22.384
Yes.

34:22.408 --> 34:24.081
She can see future.

34:24.105 --> 34:25.909
I don't believe in psychics.

34:25.933 --> 34:27.344
They're just
for the sad and desperate

34:27.369 --> 34:31.112
looking to latch on to any scrap
of hope they can get.

34:38.380 --> 34:39.661
Are you Madam Nina?

34:39.686 --> 34:41.706
Oh, no, I'm Psychic Sara.

34:41.731 --> 34:43.795
Madam Nina had to leave town

34:43.820 --> 34:46.495
due to an unforeseen
family emergency.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.172
The irony.

34:49.304 --> 34:50.304
It happens.

34:51.697 --> 34:53.154
I've never done anything
like this before.

34:53.178 --> 34:55.504
I'm just looking for guidance,

34:55.527 --> 34:57.245
a sign or something.

34:57.269 --> 34:59.508
We could all use
guidance from the other side

34:59.532 --> 35:00.987
from time to time,

35:01.011 --> 35:03.816
and that's what
Psychic Sara's here for.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.905
I just need to know
that I'm on the right path,

35:05.929 --> 35:08.889
if where I'm going
is leading me to someone.

35:10.195 --> 35:12.347
It'll be $50
for a half-hour session,

35:12.371 --> 35:14.697
and I prefer to be paid
up front.

35:14.721 --> 35:17.569
Of course.

35:17.593 --> 35:19.378
Thank you.

35:21.206 --> 35:23.488
Hmm.

35:23.512 --> 35:25.925
Mmm.

35:25.949 --> 35:27.579
Well?

35:27.603 --> 35:31.192
You've traveled over land
and sea to get here today.

35:31.216 --> 35:32.193
Yes.

35:32.217 --> 35:33.368
Hmm.

35:33.392 --> 35:35.021
Did someone just tell you that?

35:35.045 --> 35:37.198
No, you have an accent.

35:37.222 --> 35:38.677
Oh, right, yeah.

35:38.701 --> 35:43.073
But you have gone on a very
great emotional journey.

35:43.097 --> 35:44.509
And you are in the process

35:44.533 --> 35:48.383
of just beginning to learn
who you really are.

35:48.407 --> 35:49.384
Kind of.

35:49.408 --> 35:50.907
Mm-hmm.

35:50.931 --> 35:51.908
But what about men?

35:51.932 --> 35:53.692
Do you see any men in my life?

35:53.716 --> 35:55.153
Yes.

35:56.241 --> 35:59.133
I see a lifelong male companion,

35:59.157 --> 36:01.657
someone generous
and compassionate,

36:01.681 --> 36:04.616
terrific sense of humor.

36:04.640 --> 36:07.967
It's... It's starts
with like a jeh...

36:07.991 --> 36:08.751
Juh?

36:08.775 --> 36:10.753
J-Jeh... jeh...

36:10.777 --> 36:12.581
Jeh... jeh.
Jeh... jeh.

36:12.605 --> 36:14.148
Jeh... jeh.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.062
He's very flamboyant.

36:16.086 --> 36:17.238
J-Justin.

36:17.262 --> 36:18.500
Not him.

36:18.524 --> 36:21.894
Do you see any, like, men,
like love, romance?

36:21.918 --> 36:22.939
No.

36:22.963 --> 36:24.834
Well, think
before you just say it.

36:26.314 --> 36:28.360
No. No men.

36:29.839 --> 36:31.817
Haven't you got, like,
a crystal ball

36:31.841 --> 36:34.298
or something that actually
gives you right answers?

36:34.322 --> 36:36.822
It's 50 bucks extra.

36:36.846 --> 36:38.283
Of course it is.

36:48.728 --> 36:50.730
Mmm.

36:52.253 --> 36:54.168
Oh.

36:55.300 --> 36:56.866
Ah.

36:58.477 --> 36:59.869
Oh.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.981
Ah, just like I thought.
No men right now.

37:05.005 --> 37:07.810
I just gave you $50 to find
a man in your ball,

37:07.834 --> 37:09.507
and now you're telling me
there's no man?

37:09.531 --> 37:10.856
That's right.

37:10.880 --> 37:12.989
Well, it must be broken
because there is a man,

37:13.013 --> 37:15.209
and we were meant to meet,
so I just need to know

37:15.233 --> 37:17.646
if I'm still going to find him
or what this all means,

37:17.670 --> 37:19.300
but you can't tell me
'cause your stupid ball...

37:19.324 --> 37:21.258
Stop.
Probably just a paperweight anyway.

37:21.282 --> 37:24.000
It's weird.
I bet your name's not even Psychic Sara.

37:24.024 --> 37:26.331
It's probably just... "Sara."

37:28.855 --> 37:30.248
It's Sarah.

37:38.691 --> 37:40.780
Sorry.

37:42.042 --> 37:44.349
Getting too old for this shit.

37:54.141 --> 37:58.121
Psychic Sara just told me
there's no men in my life.

37:59.712 --> 38:02.821
I love the British
sense of humor.

38:02.845 --> 38:05.476
I wasn't joking.

38:05.500 --> 38:06.521
Who are you?

38:06.545 --> 38:09.132
Alvin Cooney.

38:09.156 --> 38:10.612
I'm a producer.

38:10.636 --> 38:13.136
People just call me Cooney,
though.

38:13.160 --> 38:15.312
Cooney.

38:15.336 --> 38:16.444
Close enough.

38:16.468 --> 38:19.664
Can we get another
Jalapeño margarita

38:19.688 --> 38:20.665
for this young lady?

38:20.689 --> 38:22.885
See? That was sweet.

38:22.909 --> 38:24.843
You saw my drink
was almost empty

38:24.867 --> 38:27.368
and observed what I was having.

38:27.392 --> 38:30.308
Stephen used to do that
when we were first dating.

38:34.573 --> 38:38.379
Well, I'm here now, beautiful.

38:38.403 --> 38:42.339
A man hasn't called me that
in years.

38:42.363 --> 38:44.646
At least not a straight man.

38:44.670 --> 38:48.238
Well, you must be hanging around
a lot of blind straight guys.

38:52.199 --> 38:54.482
So, Cooney,

38:54.506 --> 38:56.397
what do you think Sara meant,

38:56.421 --> 39:00.618
that I'm going to be a lonely divorced
woman for the rest of my life?

39:00.642 --> 39:01.880
How long you been divorced?

39:01.904 --> 39:03.926
Well, technically I'm not yet.

39:03.950 --> 39:06.300
Shh don't tell the husband.

39:07.693 --> 39:11.237
Your secret's safe with me.

39:11.261 --> 39:13.655
Have you ever been to Lake Como?

39:17.964 --> 39:19.594
Right now it's all about lemurs,

39:19.618 --> 39:21.117
but I see that totally changing.

39:21.141 --> 39:24.947
It's gonna be... It's gonna be
all about llamas.

39:24.971 --> 39:26.949
I love a good llama.

39:26.973 --> 39:29.691
Exactly. I'm working on
this beautifully-written film

39:29.715 --> 39:33.912
that has a really, really
strong llama protagonist.

39:33.936 --> 39:38.917
Deep, complex,
protagonistic llamas.

39:41.466 --> 39:43.444
It should be a psychic llama,

39:43.468 --> 39:45.905
that's shit at
seeing the future.

39:47.602 --> 39:52.627
You know, I could totally see you
playing the leopard antagonist.

39:52.651 --> 39:54.803
You know, your voice...
Your voice is gonna...

39:54.827 --> 39:56.413
Is gonna make you a star.

39:56.437 --> 39:57.893
I don't wanna be a star.

39:57.917 --> 39:58.807
Yes, you do.

39:58.831 --> 40:00.243
Everybody wants to be a star.

40:00.267 --> 40:01.964
Hey, easy.

40:04.489 --> 40:05.466
Stop it.

40:05.490 --> 40:07.555
Get off me, you big letch.

40:07.579 --> 40:11.080
Hey, I'm not the one who throws herself
at a highly successful producer,

40:11.104 --> 40:12.821
hoping to sleep their way
to the top.

40:12.845 --> 40:14.605
All right? You get
a reputation in this town,

40:14.629 --> 40:15.911
people will not touch you.

40:15.935 --> 40:17.608
I don't wanna make it
in this town,

40:17.632 --> 40:19.175
you big cliché.

40:19.199 --> 40:23.179
God, I didn't know people
like you actually existed.

40:23.203 --> 40:24.920
Keep yourself together.

40:24.944 --> 40:26.487
You're a mess.

40:26.511 --> 40:29.122
And that llama idea
is copyrighted.

41:28.442 --> 41:30.681
So it looks as
though the eternal bachelor

41:30.705 --> 41:32.509
could finally be settling down.

41:32.533 --> 41:34.555
I don't think any of us
saw that coming.

41:34.579 --> 41:36.426
Congratulations, George.

41:36.450 --> 41:37.862
And coming up after the break,

41:37.886 --> 41:39.647
we'll be taking a look
at what the weather

41:39.671 --> 41:42.301
has in store for us this week.

41:42.325 --> 41:44.478
The couple was spotted
together over the weekend,

41:44.502 --> 41:46.001
and according to reports,

41:46.025 --> 41:48.307
she was seen sporting
an engagement ring.

41:48.331 --> 41:51.093
Reliable sources close
the couple confirmed,

41:51.117 --> 41:52.268
this is it, ladies.

41:52.292 --> 41:53.835
He's off the market for good.

41:53.859 --> 41:56.533
George Clooney
is getting married.

41:59.125 --> 42:00.450
What is it?

42:00.474 --> 42:01.712
What the hell happened?
He's getting married!

42:01.736 --> 42:03.888
Stephen?
No, George!

42:03.912 --> 42:06.587
You did not
wake me up at 3:00 a.m.

42:06.611 --> 42:08.153
over George Clooney!

42:08.177 --> 42:10.504
I thought if I came to L.A.,
I just might meet him.

42:10.528 --> 42:13.594
Oh, my... seriously, Poppy.
You sound nuts.

42:13.618 --> 42:16.335
I love you but you're
on my last nerve.

42:16.359 --> 42:17.511
I can't take it.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.730
Your moping and "Woe is me"

42:19.754 --> 42:22.167
and the inconsideration
of my work.

42:22.191 --> 42:23.604
You sound just like Stephen.

42:23.628 --> 42:25.780
Well, if this is what
he had to put up with,

42:25.804 --> 42:27.999
it's no wonder that he
turned to bird watching.

42:28.023 --> 42:30.132
Well, you'd know all
about cheating, wouldn't you?

42:30.156 --> 42:32.743
You're playing the victim and seem
to have conveniently forgotten

42:32.767 --> 42:35.529
that you cheated on Paolo
before he cheated on you.

42:35.553 --> 42:36.921
You're a hypocrite!

42:36.945 --> 42:38.270
You know what?

42:38.294 --> 42:41.646
I think you should find
another place to stay.

43:01.579 --> 43:05.428
<i>♪ Will you hold my hand</i>

43:05.452 --> 43:08.150

Hey.

44:06.252 --> 44:07.708
Hey.

44:07.732 --> 44:09.666
Didn't think you'd be up yet.

44:09.690 --> 44:13.235
I got an early start.

44:13.259 --> 44:15.759
Justin, I'm so sorry about
the things I said last night,

44:15.783 --> 44:17.065
how I've been behaving.

44:17.089 --> 44:19.415
I've been a terrible guest,
I know,

44:19.439 --> 44:20.919
and you've been so kind.

44:22.747 --> 44:24.681
I'll be gone
by the time you get home.

44:24.705 --> 44:27.597
Look, you don't have to leave,

44:27.621 --> 44:29.730
but you can't carry on
like this.

44:29.754 --> 44:32.428
I'm worried about you.
I know.

44:32.452 --> 44:33.821
I know.

44:33.845 --> 44:35.934
I'm going to get myself together.
I promise.

44:38.545 --> 44:40.112

45:32.468 --> 45:33.663

It's my first date in years.

46:42.495 --> 46:43.864
I knitted it myself.

Really?

46:45.063 --> 46:46.127
You knit?

46:46.151 --> 46:48.738
Yeah, something so meditative

about a man's hands
around needle and yarn.

46:51.547 --> 46:53.395
It's like a symphony.

46:53.419 --> 46:56.398
Wow, you're full of surprises.

46:56.422 --> 46:58.182
Yeah.

46:58.206 --> 46:59.923
So what did you bring?

46:59.947 --> 47:01.229
I'm starving.

47:01.253 --> 47:05.039
Well, I have a surprise for you.
Close your eyes.

47:06.127 --> 47:08.608
Close your eyes.

47:11.829 --> 47:13.091

47:20.228 --> 47:21.249
Mm-hm.

47:21.273 --> 47:23.555
This is... interesting.

47:23.579 --> 47:26.297
It's a kale-kelp-quinoa cake.

47:26.321 --> 47:28.473
I made it myself.

47:28.497 --> 47:30.388
Mm, it's delicious.

47:30.412 --> 47:33.217
I'm just, uh, allergic to kale.

47:33.241 --> 47:35.089
That's a very specific allergy.

47:35.113 --> 47:39.813
Anyway, I have another
surprise for you.

47:41.771 --> 47:44.925
A little Vegemite sarnie, eh?

47:44.949 --> 47:48.102
Luke, Vegemite is Australian.

47:48.126 --> 47:49.451
No.

47:49.475 --> 47:51.670
I could've sworn
that it was English.

47:51.694 --> 47:54.915
It's fine. I actually do love
a Vegemite sandwich.

47:59.789 --> 48:02.618
It's on my favorite spelt bread.

48:07.058 --> 48:08.973
Look. Duck over there.

48:11.540 --> 48:14.345
Yeah, it's diving.

48:14.369 --> 48:16.608
It's good, right?

48:16.632 --> 48:19.350
This is so thoughtful of you.

48:19.374 --> 48:21.570
It's easy to be thoughtful

48:21.594 --> 48:23.422
when you care about someone.

48:25.119 --> 48:27.793
I know I talked about
fate and meeting George,

48:27.817 --> 48:29.621
but I really do believe,
this whole time

48:29.645 --> 48:31.623
I was destined to meet Luke.

48:31.647 --> 48:33.887
Don't you think this
still plays into your desire

49:46.331 --> 49:49.049
Hey, you,
what are you doing here?

49:49.073 --> 49:52.052
I was going to check on
an aerial yoga class nearby.

49:52.076 --> 49:54.141
Thought that I'd come
and take you.

49:54.165 --> 49:55.751
That's a lovely thought,

49:55.775 --> 49:57.274
but you go.

49:57.298 --> 49:59.929

of yoga later at your place.

49:59.953 --> 50:02.086
That is what I am talking about.

50:11.269 --> 50:13.595
Oh, that's my boss.

50:13.619 --> 50:15.423
I'll see you later.

50:15.447 --> 50:16.970
Okay, goddess.

50:21.801 --> 50:24.823
Poppy! I see you're having
a breakdown

50:24.847 --> 50:26.956
and have gone and got
yourself a toy boy.

50:26.980 --> 50:28.610
Oh, God, who told you that?

50:28.634 --> 50:30.960
We're Facebook friends.

50:30.984 --> 50:32.005
Oh, yeah.

50:32.029 --> 50:34.268
I had one in the '80s.
A toy boy?

50:34.292 --> 50:35.269
No, a breakdown.

50:35.293 --> 50:36.357
Best thing I ever did.

50:36.381 --> 50:37.619
Resigned as housewife

50:37.643 --> 50:38.968
and eventually wound up

50:38.992 --> 50:41.449
editor of
Women's Chitchat Magazine.

50:41.473 --> 50:43.059
So not all bad, then.

50:43.083 --> 50:45.627
How would you like to have
your breakdown

50:45.651 --> 50:47.020
in a weekly column?

50:47.044 --> 50:48.543

50:48.567 --> 50:49.848
Absolutely not.

50:52.658 --> 50:55.463

50:55.487 --> 50:57.987
Yeah, that's me,
tragic, all right.

50:58.011 --> 50:59.380
It's relatable.

50:59.404 --> 51:03.123
You'd be the voice of thousands
of downtrodden wives

51:03.147 --> 51:06.213
who would love to have the guts
to do what you did.

51:06.237 --> 51:07.214

51:36.615 --> 51:39.594
you didn't really think you were going
to meet George Clooney here, did you?

51:39.618 --> 51:40.986
No, of course not.

51:41.010 --> 51:42.510
Don't be silly.

51:42.534 --> 51:44.642

going to mention it again.

51:44.666 --> 51:47.341

56:39.178 --> 56:41.006
Open.

56:42.747 --> 56:48.119
I wanna film you, me and Irina
in a Tantric three-way.

56:48.143 --> 56:49.971
It'll be beautiful.

56:53.279 --> 56:54.474
You insane?

56:54.498 --> 56:56.780
You don't wanna have
threesomes with me?

56:56.804 --> 56:59.740
No, Irina, I don't want to
have threesomes with you.

56:59.764 --> 57:01.959
You tell me she want threesomes.

57:01.983 --> 57:06.616
He say you need love of Russian
woman to help you learn good sex.

57:06.640 --> 57:08.009
I need to learn good sex?

57:08.033 --> 57:09.358
You make love beautifully.

57:09.382 --> 57:11.534
I just know that you're
on this whole new kick

57:11.558 --> 57:13.493
of unleashing
your inner wild child.

57:13.517 --> 57:15.146
And I just wanted to do
something nice

57:15.170 --> 57:16.496
for us as a couple.

57:16.520 --> 57:18.280
I thought that
you would be into it.

57:18.304 --> 57:20.456
Well, I'm very sorry
to disappoint you.

57:20.480 --> 57:21.501
It's okay.

57:21.525 --> 57:22.893
You don't have to be sorry.

57:22.917 --> 57:24.852
Not sorry sorry.

57:24.876 --> 57:26.070
And it's not okay.

57:26.094 --> 57:28.159
You were going to have sex
with my boyfriend.

57:28.183 --> 57:31.032
And you. I did for you.

57:31.056 --> 57:33.034
Him, he not my type.

57:33.058 --> 57:34.514
Big misunderstand.

57:34.538 --> 57:36.211
Hey, llama lover.

57:36.235 --> 57:37.299
You're overreacting.

57:37.323 --> 57:39.257
Never say that again.

57:39.281 --> 57:40.607
And take one step closer,

57:40.631 --> 57:43.044
and I'll really unleash
my inner wild child.

57:43.068 --> 57:44.132
Does Justin know about this?

57:44.156 --> 57:45.481
N-No.

57:45.505 --> 57:47.265
No, this... this be
our little secret.

57:47.289 --> 57:48.769
Keep it that way.

57:50.989 --> 57:52.643
Nice knowing you, Luke.

58:12.924 --> 58:15.380
I mean, would George Clooney want
to film a three-way sex tape

58:15.404 --> 58:17.382
with me and the cleaner?

58:17.406 --> 58:18.383
Maybe.

58:18.407 --> 58:20.255
No, because he's a gentleman.

58:20.279 --> 58:21.909
Well, Poppy, nobody's perfect.

58:21.933 --> 58:24.936
I mean, I'm sure
even George Clooney has flaws.

58:26.720 --> 58:30.463
I bet he knows Harry Potter's
not from the land down under.

58:31.420 --> 58:33.050
Luke was hot, though.

58:33.074 --> 58:35.226
And oh, my goodness,

58:35.250 --> 58:37.228
he did have the most amazing...

58:37.252 --> 58:38.708
Poppy.
Hmm?

58:38.732 --> 58:42.103
I think for now you
should focus on yourself.

58:42.127 --> 58:46.586
I mean, you don't wanna rush
into another relationship.

58:46.610 --> 58:48.065
Do you know what?

58:48.089 --> 58:49.327
I think you're right.

58:49.351 --> 58:52.592
I've never had
that "Screw men" moment in life,

58:52.616 --> 58:53.984
but I'm gonna have it now.

58:54.008 --> 58:55.464
Screw men.

58:55.488 --> 58:58.511
It's time to focus my energy
on something more deserving.

58:58.535 --> 59:01.122
Good. Good.

59:01.146 --> 59:02.495
Like what?

59:09.415 --> 59:10.653
What's with the pumpkins?

59:10.677 --> 59:12.525
I figured it out.

59:12.549 --> 59:15.092
I know where I need to start
putting my energy instead of men.

59:15.116 --> 59:16.180
Vegetables?

59:16.204 --> 59:17.530
No, charity.

59:17.554 --> 59:19.140
We're gonna sell these
to raise money.

59:19.164 --> 59:20.620
It's Halloween soon.

59:20.644 --> 59:22.622
Not that soon, but okay.

59:22.646 --> 59:24.972
It's like, I'm starting
to feel sorry for myself,

59:24.996 --> 59:26.930
and I saw this article
and all the charity work

59:26.954 --> 59:28.671
George Clooney does in Sudan.

59:28.695 --> 59:30.630
He literally goes into war zones

59:30.654 --> 59:33.023
to generate attention
and action to stop the war.

59:33.047 --> 59:36.026
Makes me realize I really
can't complain about anything.

59:36.050 --> 59:38.159
Kind of puts it
into perspective, hmm?

59:38.183 --> 59:39.377
Exactly.

59:39.401 --> 59:41.466
So we're going to do
this pumpkin drive,

59:41.490 --> 59:43.686
and I'm going to write
about it for the column.

59:43.710 --> 59:44.929
We?

59:52.240 --> 59:53.435
Where's your costume?

59:53.459 --> 59:54.958
You're meant to be a pumpkin.

59:54.982 --> 59:56.133
So are you.

59:56.157 --> 59:57.221
What happened?

59:57.245 --> 59:58.483
They didn't have
my size pumpkin,

59:58.507 --> 01:00:00.268
so I thought this was
the next best thing.

01:00:00.292 --> 01:00:01.791
Anyway, Thanksgiving's
not far away.

01:00:01.815 --> 01:00:05.578
It's not till November.
But you know what?

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.362
You're British.
You can get away with it.

01:00:07.386 --> 01:00:08.755
Hey, all!

01:00:08.779 --> 01:00:10.670
Ready to sell some pumpkins?

01:00:10.694 --> 01:00:14.630
Poppy, what on earth
are you wearing?

01:00:14.654 --> 01:00:17.459
You do not look like a pumpkin.

01:00:17.483 --> 01:00:19.417
I'm a turkey.

01:00:19.441 --> 01:00:20.505
Don't ask.

01:00:20.529 --> 01:00:21.681
Where's your costume?

01:00:21.705 --> 01:00:23.813
It clashed with my skin tone.

01:00:23.837 --> 01:00:25.796
By I am wearing orange socks.

01:00:27.101 --> 01:00:28.601
Wear this.

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:31.105
Right. Let's do this.

01:00:34.761 --> 01:00:37.610
People, hear me now

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:39.437
and listen well.

01:00:39.461 --> 01:00:41.439
Come and get your pumpkins

01:00:41.463 --> 01:00:42.919
from the crazy turkey lady,

01:00:42.943 --> 01:00:46.619
who somehow convinced me
to do this on my day off.

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:50.100
All proceeds go to charity.

01:00:50.124 --> 01:00:51.711
Hello.

01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:53.930
Why are you dressed
like a chicken?

01:00:53.954 --> 01:00:55.652
I'm a turkey.

01:00:58.219 --> 01:01:01.068
You look stupid.

01:01:01.092 --> 01:01:04.791
Marcy, would you like to serve
this delightful little boy?

01:01:09.317 --> 01:01:11.339
I told you it was too early.

01:01:11.363 --> 01:01:15.082
Oh, and it's so hot.

01:01:16.455 --> 01:01:19.676
Justin, will you give me a hand?

01:01:23.331 --> 01:01:24.613
That's more like it.

01:01:24.637 --> 01:01:26.093
Hey, put your clothes back on.

01:01:26.117 --> 01:01:28.032
You're gonna drive away
all our business.

01:01:44.483 --> 01:01:45.939
Check out the hottie.

01:01:45.963 --> 01:01:47.375
Hi.
Can I help you?

01:01:47.399 --> 01:01:48.681
Oh, it's okay.
I've got this one.

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.160
No, no, no, no,
you're all right.

01:01:50.184 --> 01:01:51.466
I'll handle this, ladies.

01:01:51.490 --> 01:01:52.665
Oh, thanks...

01:01:54.232 --> 01:01:56.776
Wow, it looks like you guys
are doing amazing.

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.342
You've raised a lot of money.

01:01:58.366 --> 01:01:59.648
People have been very generous.

01:01:59.672 --> 01:02:00.954
Tell you what.

01:02:00.978 --> 01:02:04.435
I'll double it
if you give me a gobble.

01:02:04.459 --> 01:02:06.786
That's disgusting.
Pervert.

01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:09.310
Poppy, he means like
the turkey noise.

01:02:09.334 --> 01:02:10.790
You know, gobble, gobble.

01:02:10.814 --> 01:02:12.487
Oh.
Mm-hm.

01:02:12.511 --> 01:02:14.445
How about you triple it,
if she gives you a gobble

01:02:14.469 --> 01:02:15.795
and I give you a happy ending?

01:02:15.819 --> 01:02:16.970
Justin!

01:02:16.994 --> 01:02:17.797
I'm so sorry.

01:02:17.821 --> 01:02:19.320
We didn't mean to offend.

01:02:19.344 --> 01:02:21.670
It's okay, no offense
taken, and I'm good.

01:02:21.694 --> 01:02:23.150
Damn, had to try.

01:02:23.174 --> 01:02:24.499
Okay, Poppy, it's all on you.

01:02:24.523 --> 01:02:27.241
Um, I don't really know
how to gobble.

01:02:27.265 --> 01:02:29.896
It's like... gobble, gobble.

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:30.897
Gobble, gobble.

01:02:31.791 --> 01:02:32.986
No, no, it's more like,

01:02:33.010 --> 01:02:35.249
Gobble, gobble-gobble-gobble...

01:02:35.273 --> 01:02:36.250
It is not like that.

01:02:36.274 --> 01:02:37.338
It is more like,

01:02:46.719 --> 01:02:47.696
Collectively terrible.

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.002
You do the wings, it helps.

01:02:49.026 --> 01:02:52.005
Like...

01:02:52.029 --> 01:02:55.138
This is great.
We raised so much money.

01:02:55.162 --> 01:02:57.924
So the turkey costume
was worth it, then.

01:02:57.948 --> 01:03:00.274
Well, it definitely
helped us go viral.

01:03:00.298 --> 01:03:01.492
What?

01:03:01.516 --> 01:03:03.494
I tweeted a picture of us
in costume.

01:03:03.518 --> 01:03:05.018
So far almost 5,000 people

01:03:05.042 --> 01:03:06.541
have retweeted it.

01:03:06.565 --> 01:03:10.327
You tweeted me dressed as
a sweaty inflatable pumpkin?

01:03:10.351 --> 01:03:11.851
Oh, who cares what we look like?

01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:14.027
Got people talking
about the Enough Project.

01:03:14.051 --> 01:03:18.945
The relief effort led by the great
Halloween humanitarian turkey.

01:03:20.884 --> 01:03:23.036
Ugh, doom's calling.

01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:24.452
Sally.

01:03:25.889 --> 01:03:28.215
Hi, Sally.
Stephen called.

01:03:28.239 --> 01:03:30.217
Why? What did he want?

01:03:30.241 --> 01:03:33.568
He said you filed divorce papers
without even discussing it.

01:03:33.592 --> 01:03:35.352
I have discussed it.

01:03:35.376 --> 01:03:36.658
With my therapist.

01:03:36.682 --> 01:03:38.834
There are two people
in a marriage.

01:03:38.858 --> 01:03:40.009
Something went wrong somewhere.

01:03:40.033 --> 01:03:41.532
So it's my fault?

01:03:41.556 --> 01:03:43.708
My husband cheats on me but
I must've done something wrong

01:03:43.732 --> 01:03:45.058
or it would never have happened?

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:49.889
Poppy, you know how fond
she is of Stephen,

01:03:49.913 --> 01:03:51.716
and she's just really upset

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:53.327
about all this talk
of you two divorcing.

01:03:53.351 --> 01:03:54.763
She's upset?

01:03:54.787 --> 01:03:56.504
It's not her husband
that's lying and cheating.

01:03:56.528 --> 01:03:57.722
It's mine.

01:03:57.746 --> 01:03:59.637
Perhaps you could remind
her of that.

01:03:59.661 --> 01:04:01.204
Look, whatever you decide to do,

01:04:01.228 --> 01:04:03.293
we will support you.
You know that.

01:04:03.317 --> 01:04:05.078
Yeah, well, you might.

01:04:05.102 --> 01:04:07.428
Not so sure about her.

01:04:07.452 --> 01:04:09.584
Sorry Peter,
I'm gonna have to go.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.807
No wonder
you don't wanna go back.

01:04:19.116 --> 01:04:22.747
Oh, I feel bad leaving you
on your birthday,

01:04:22.771 --> 01:04:24.488
but I promise you we're going
to celebrate tomorrow.

01:04:24.512 --> 01:04:27.274
Don't be silly. The wedding
planner can't miss the wedding.

01:04:27.298 --> 01:04:29.058
I'm so over it.

01:04:29.082 --> 01:04:30.625
You have such a gift.

01:04:30.649 --> 01:04:32.061
You should be fully
expressing it.

01:04:32.085 --> 01:04:34.759
Yeah, well, tell my boss that.

01:04:34.783 --> 01:04:36.936
Just make sure
you're not on your own.

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.763
Irina's around.
You two should get together.

01:04:38.787 --> 01:04:40.877
I think I'll be okay.

01:04:43.836 --> 01:04:46.012
Have fun.
Ugh, I'll try.

01:05:35.496 --> 01:05:36.909
I brought you a cupcake.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:39.607
I thought you would be
with friends today.

01:05:39.631 --> 01:05:41.304
You're a friend.

01:05:41.328 --> 01:05:43.219
Kind of.

01:05:43.243 --> 01:05:45.047
Who I pay. A lot.

01:05:45.071 --> 01:05:49.399
Justin's working and Marcy's
on a romantic weekend.

01:05:49.423 --> 01:05:51.053
Bit different from last year.

01:05:51.077 --> 01:05:53.969
Stephen planned dinner.
Got tickets to a West End show.

01:05:53.993 --> 01:05:56.319
I actually had
a really lovely evening.

01:05:56.343 --> 01:05:58.955
Are you feeling homesick?

01:06:00.782 --> 01:06:02.021
Kind of.

01:06:02.045 --> 01:06:04.371
I mean, sunshine's nice,

01:06:04.395 --> 01:06:06.895
but fall is beautiful
in England.

01:06:06.919 --> 01:06:09.767
I have a great group
of friends who I miss.

01:06:09.791 --> 01:06:12.292
Some of the husbands
are friends with Stephen.

01:06:12.316 --> 01:06:13.902
So that's going to be
interesting.

01:06:13.926 --> 01:06:16.929
How are you feeling
about the divorce?

01:06:24.067 --> 01:06:25.764
I'll be fine.

01:06:46.176 --> 01:06:49.068
You tell me
what I do to make right.

01:06:49.092 --> 01:06:50.615
Happy birthday.

01:06:51.964 --> 01:06:53.072
Thanks.

01:06:53.096 --> 01:06:54.595
I'm sorry, Poppy.

01:06:54.619 --> 01:06:57.337
Luke, he bad person.
He lie...

01:06:57.361 --> 01:06:59.687
Look, let's just forget
it ever happened

01:06:59.711 --> 01:07:01.974
and be thankful
he's not around anymore.

01:07:03.715 --> 01:07:06.805
He have strange eyes,
your husband.

01:07:07.893 --> 01:07:09.373
Like a bug.

01:07:10.461 --> 01:07:13.179
You know, he called me
all the time at first,

01:07:13.203 --> 01:07:14.876
but now he just seems
to have given up.

01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:18.358
I mean, I know I told him
not to contact me, but still.

01:07:18.382 --> 01:07:20.447
If he right man for you,
he will come,

01:07:20.471 --> 01:07:22.797
and he will beg
for you to return.

01:07:22.821 --> 01:07:23.972
And if he no do,

01:07:23.996 --> 01:07:25.365
in Russia we have a saying.

01:07:25.389 --> 01:07:26.888
He break your heart,

01:07:26.912 --> 01:07:30.394
we send Uncle Yakov
to break his balls.

01:07:33.919 --> 01:07:34.983
He's left me!

01:07:35.007 --> 01:07:36.593
Oh, my God, what happened?

01:07:36.617 --> 01:07:38.769
He got a last-minute meeting
on the East Coast

01:07:38.793 --> 01:07:41.424
and just dropped our
romantic weekend and left.

01:07:41.448 --> 01:07:43.644
I thought meant he'd left left.

01:07:43.668 --> 01:07:44.993
He has!

01:07:45.017 --> 01:07:46.560
He's ruined our wine tour.

01:07:46.584 --> 01:07:48.997
Ooh, I was madder
than a wet hen,

01:07:49.021 --> 01:07:50.129
but then he was all,

01:07:50.153 --> 01:07:52.479
"Honey, I'm so sorry.

01:07:52.503 --> 01:07:56.396
Take my credit card
and have some fun with Poppy."

01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:59.138
So happy birthday!

01:08:03.166 --> 01:08:05.013
This is Irina.

01:08:05.037 --> 01:08:06.362
Three-way Irina?

01:08:06.386 --> 01:08:08.451
We're all right now.

01:08:08.475 --> 01:08:09.278
Hello.

01:08:09.302 --> 01:08:11.454
Hello, Irina.

01:08:11.478 --> 01:08:16.068
I've heard so much about you.

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:19.897
So, Poppy, we have
to celebrate your birthday.

01:08:19.921 --> 01:08:21.551
Where do you want to go?

01:08:21.575 --> 01:08:23.075
Vegas? Jerry's paying.

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:25.337
Would you mind
if we just stayed home?

01:08:25.362 --> 01:08:26.991
We could have
a nice cozy dinner here.

01:08:27.015 --> 01:08:29.341
We've got pumpkins left.
We could have pumpkin soup

01:08:29.366 --> 01:08:30.386
and pumpkin pie.

01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:31.908
Anything but pumpkins.

01:08:31.933 --> 01:08:33.911
Tequila.

01:08:45.469 --> 01:08:47.533
I had bad husband in Russia.

01:08:47.558 --> 01:08:49.752
I didn't know you were married.

01:08:49.777 --> 01:08:53.844
Da, the reason
I leave and come here.

01:08:53.868 --> 01:08:55.542
He cheat with my sister.

01:08:55.566 --> 01:08:57.892
He sold all my stuff
to buy crack.

01:08:57.916 --> 01:08:59.198
When I told him to leave,

01:08:59.221 --> 01:09:00.701
he run over my dog.

01:09:06.272 --> 01:09:07.944
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you</i>

01:09:09.622 --> 01:09:12.080
I heard there was
a slumber party going on.

01:09:12.104 --> 01:09:13.341
You left the wedding.

01:09:13.366 --> 01:09:14.952
No. I left the job.

01:09:14.975 --> 01:09:16.563
Wait. What?

01:09:16.587 --> 01:09:19.348
I was standing there holding these
ridiculous feather headpieces

01:09:19.372 --> 01:09:20.741
for the swan bridesmaids,

01:09:20.765 --> 01:09:22.524
my boss was yelling at me,
and I thought,

01:09:22.549 --> 01:09:24.745
"WWPD... What would Poppy do?

01:09:24.769 --> 01:09:27.399
She'd just get up and leave
and start fresh."

01:09:27.424 --> 01:09:30.359
So it's time to put
my creativity to work.

01:09:30.383 --> 01:09:31.969
I'm starting my own company.

01:09:31.993 --> 01:09:33.406
Finally!

01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:35.537
I'm so happy for you.

01:09:35.562 --> 01:09:38.062
And I picked up a good-bye gift

01:09:38.086 --> 01:09:39.803
on the way out.

01:09:39.827 --> 01:09:42.109
Now, enough talking.

01:09:42.134 --> 01:09:44.460
We celebrate birthday
Russian style.

01:09:44.484 --> 01:09:45.765
I'll get shot glasses.

01:09:45.790 --> 01:09:47.810
Oh, no, not shots.

01:09:47.835 --> 01:09:50.118
Hell, yes, shots!

01:09:59.412 --> 01:10:00.955
Morning, Charlie Chaplin.

01:10:02.459 --> 01:10:04.591
Mmm, coffee.

01:10:07.028 --> 01:10:08.421
Mmm.

01:10:12.164 --> 01:10:13.446
You think she's okay?

01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:15.578
Yeah. She's Russian.

01:10:15.602 --> 01:10:18.277
They're weaned on vodka.

01:10:18.301 --> 01:10:20.409
Awkward.
That's our thing.

01:10:20.433 --> 01:10:22.629
Got the novice coming in, so
we're going to go just in case.

01:10:22.653 --> 01:10:23.978
Okay, we'll move.
We're going.

01:10:25.133 --> 01:10:26.415
Where is it?
Do you see it?

01:10:26.439 --> 01:10:27.634
Yeah, that one was a rocket.

01:10:27.658 --> 01:10:29.201
It just sailed over there.

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:31.115
See if we can see what it hit.

01:10:31.139 --> 01:10:34.771
I bet George Clooney wouldn't
abandon our romantic weekend.

01:10:34.795 --> 01:10:38.166
Or if he did, it would be to save
orphans in Burma or something.

01:10:39.365 --> 01:10:40.975
I'll get it.

01:10:45.328 --> 01:10:46.783
Stephen.

01:10:46.807 --> 01:10:48.176
Stephen?

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:49.177
Stephen?

01:10:49.201 --> 01:10:50.309
Hey, Poppy.

01:10:50.333 --> 01:10:51.638
Uh, can I come in?

01:10:52.509 --> 01:10:55.686
Stephen darling, been too long.

01:10:56.513 --> 01:10:59.013
Or should I say,
not long enough.

01:10:59.037 --> 01:11:01.363
Justin, fabulous as ever.

01:11:01.387 --> 01:11:05.435
Awkward. Come on, Marcy.
We leave.

01:11:09.439 --> 01:11:10.851
I can't believe you're here.

01:11:10.875 --> 01:11:13.027
Shouldn't we go somewhere
more private?

01:11:13.051 --> 01:11:15.638
I'm not kicking Justin
out of his home.

01:11:15.662 --> 01:11:16.900
He was there
when we got married.

01:11:16.924 --> 01:11:18.685
He can witness our divorce, too.

01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:22.365
I'll just be showering away
my actions from last night.

01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:27.084
I had to come.
You wouldn't take my calls.

01:11:27.108 --> 01:11:28.738
What do you expect?

01:11:28.762 --> 01:11:31.524
You didn't exactly try
very hard, did you?

01:11:31.548 --> 01:11:32.786
I've been here for months.

01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:34.744
Took you this long
to get on a plane?

01:11:34.768 --> 01:11:36.268
I didn't know how to handle it.

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:37.834
I kept thinking,
"She'll come home."

01:11:37.858 --> 01:11:38.748
I'm sorry, Poppy.

01:11:38.772 --> 01:11:40.402
How could you do it, Stephen?

01:11:40.426 --> 01:11:42.448
How could you sleep
with someone behind my back

01:11:42.472 --> 01:11:44.188
and blatantly lie to my face?

01:11:44.212 --> 01:11:46.887
I mean,
I know things weren't great,

01:11:46.911 --> 01:11:49.193
but at least have the decency
to finish it first.

01:11:49.217 --> 01:11:50.630
I never meant for it to happen.

01:11:50.654 --> 01:11:53.415
Never meant for it to happen
but let it carry on anyway.

01:11:53.439 --> 01:11:54.416
It wasn't like that.

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:55.876
Well, what was it like?

01:11:56.964 --> 01:11:58.420
Bird watching.

01:11:58.444 --> 01:12:01.336
You must've both had a good
laugh at how gullible I was.

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:04.165
We didn't.
I didn't.

01:12:04.189 --> 01:12:05.732
I'm sorry, Poppy.

01:12:05.756 --> 01:12:06.733
Do I know her?

01:12:06.757 --> 01:12:08.256
How long has it been going on...

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:09.910
Is it still going on?

01:12:09.934 --> 01:12:12.502
I met her through work.
It was just a few weeks.

01:12:13.372 --> 01:12:14.436
Was she good?

01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:16.351
Poppy.
Do you love her?

01:12:16.375 --> 01:12:17.768
No, of course not.

01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:20.399
Well, you're not the only one.

01:12:20.423 --> 01:12:22.749
I met a guy out here, Luke.

01:12:22.773 --> 01:12:26.666
He's 29 1/2, and he's hot
and fit and adventurous in bed

01:12:26.690 --> 01:12:28.300
and everything you're not.

01:12:29.954 --> 01:12:31.434
Hurts, doesn't it?

01:12:35.438 --> 01:12:38.155
I just don't think
we can get over this.

01:12:38.179 --> 01:12:40.593
You had an affair.

01:12:40.617 --> 01:12:44.316
She said it wasn't a love affair.
It was a midlife crisis.

01:12:45.796 --> 01:12:48.451
He tried to rope me into
a threesome with the cleaner.

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:54.650
Look, Poppy,

01:12:54.674 --> 01:12:57.349
just know that when
you're ready to come home,

01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:59.549
I'll be there.

01:13:00.941 --> 01:13:02.049
Is that it?

01:13:02.073 --> 01:13:03.311
What?

01:13:03.335 --> 01:13:05.052
Was that it?

01:13:05.076 --> 01:13:08.316
How many Richard Curtis movies
have I made you sit through?

01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:12.276
Notting Hill, Four Weddings and
a Funeral, Love-bloody Actually.

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:15.236
Fight for us.
Scream. Shout.

01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:17.107
Convince me you can't
live without me.

01:13:17.131 --> 01:13:19.893
When did Hugh Grant ever
run up to anyone and say,

01:13:19.917 --> 01:13:22.765
"Well, you know, I'm here.
Take your time. No hurry."

01:13:22.789 --> 01:13:25.464
Actually, isn't that
what he always does?

01:13:25.488 --> 01:13:26.900
Oh, that's not the point.

01:13:26.924 --> 01:13:29.337
It's not about Hugh Grant.
It's about you.

01:13:29.361 --> 01:13:31.600
Look, Poppy, it might be
like that in your movies,

01:13:31.624 --> 01:13:34.473
but it's a little bit
different in real life.

01:13:34.497 --> 01:13:36.431
If that's how you feel,

01:13:36.455 --> 01:13:37.998
you should've just saved
yourself the air fare.

01:13:38.022 --> 01:13:39.763
Have a safe flight home!

01:13:47.858 --> 01:13:51.490
I can't imagine
my life without you.

01:13:51.514 --> 01:13:54.275
And I don't want to.

01:13:54.299 --> 01:13:56.625
This is making me want
to be in love.

01:13:56.649 --> 01:13:58.192
...till the end of time.

01:13:58.216 --> 01:14:00.934
But it's fake and too much.

01:14:00.958 --> 01:14:02.414
Okay, switching gears,

01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:04.938
nothing makes me feel better
than a dip and a tan.

01:14:04.962 --> 01:14:06.572
Hmm, sounds good.

01:14:10.402 --> 01:14:11.597
This is nice.

01:14:11.621 --> 01:14:13.337
We should do it more often.

01:14:13.361 --> 01:14:15.209
Totally.

01:14:17.714 --> 01:14:20.344
Hello.
Why haven't you returned my calls?

01:14:20.368 --> 01:14:23.173
Oh, hi, Sharon. Sorry, I was
just about to call you back.

01:14:23.197 --> 01:14:25.219
Have you checked
your work emails lately?

01:14:25.243 --> 01:14:28.527
Some post of you
in a turkey suit

01:14:28.551 --> 01:14:30.964
raising money for charity
has gone viral,

01:14:30.988 --> 01:14:33.836
and we're being inundated
with emails.

01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:37.144
Now the producers
of the 3:00 Show

01:14:37.168 --> 01:14:39.407
have been in touch,
and they want to try you out

01:14:39.431 --> 01:14:40.974
presenting a weekly segment!

01:14:40.998 --> 01:14:43.019
What? About what?

01:14:43.043 --> 01:14:44.368
Divorce. Affairs.

01:14:44.392 --> 01:14:46.501
Women's issues.

01:14:46.525 --> 01:14:47.981
They like you.

01:14:48.005 --> 01:14:49.896
You're joking.

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:52.855
I'm not, but you better get your
ass on a plane and back to London.

01:14:52.879 --> 01:14:54.814
I'm not ready to come
back yet, Sharon.

01:14:54.838 --> 01:14:57.077
Of course you are.
It'll be great for the magazine.

01:14:57.101 --> 01:14:59.296
No, everything's still...

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:02.323
Seriously, it's a nice offer,
but I can't.

01:15:07.764 --> 01:15:09.437
It's all right, sitting there,

01:15:09.461 --> 01:15:12.899
rollerblading, smoking pot
on Venice Beach.

01:15:39.273 --> 01:15:42.775
Honey, this could be a
really great opportunity for you.

01:15:42.799 --> 01:15:44.341
This is the dream.

01:15:44.365 --> 01:15:47.780
I know, and I know I'll
have to go back eventually,

01:15:47.804 --> 01:15:49.521
but I'm happy here.

01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:51.348
I feel as though
I'm finally being me.

01:15:52.678 --> 01:15:54.656
Stephen!
What, you're still here?

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:56.266
Can I just...
Come in.

01:15:56.290 --> 01:15:57.920
Why are you all...
These... for you.

01:15:57.944 --> 01:16:00.357
Oh, I can't breathe.
Here, honey. Some water.

01:16:00.381 --> 01:16:03.210
I wanted to tell you
I do want you back.

01:16:04.211 --> 01:16:05.667
So I ran.

01:16:05.691 --> 01:16:07.930
From the hotel?
Why didn't you just get a cab?

01:16:07.954 --> 01:16:09.323
Actually I drove over here.

01:16:09.347 --> 01:16:12.500
I ran from the car.
Killed me.

01:16:12.524 --> 01:16:15.938
Anyway, it's a romantic gesture,
like in the movies.

01:16:15.962 --> 01:16:19.202
I do want to fight for you.
I came to L.A. to get you back,

01:16:19.226 --> 01:16:21.596
and it's exactly
what I'm going to do.

01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:24.556
I believe this is yours,
Mrs. Wakefield.

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:28.298
I battled rose bushes
for five days looking for that.

01:16:28.322 --> 01:16:30.213
Those scars
have only just faded.

01:16:36.026 --> 01:16:37.767
Let me just grab my things.

01:16:49.256 --> 01:16:51.887
Hi, Paolo, it's Justin.

01:16:51.911 --> 01:16:54.498
Would you be open to having
dinner with me this week?

01:16:54.522 --> 01:16:56.239
I'd love to see you.

01:17:01.486 --> 01:17:03.749
Wow, this is great.

01:17:49.447 --> 01:17:51.754
I've missed you so much.

01:17:54.626 --> 01:17:56.909
What have you missed the most?

01:17:56.933 --> 01:17:58.258
Maybe this?

01:17:58.282 --> 01:18:00.632
Or maybe this?

01:18:01.851 --> 01:18:03.374
Or maybe this?

01:18:04.201 --> 01:18:06.353
I've missed everything.

01:18:06.377 --> 01:18:09.554
Your cooking, doing
the crossword together.

01:18:11.643 --> 01:18:14.254
Making my morning coffee.

01:18:18.563 --> 01:18:20.783
I've missed the way
you fold my socks.

01:18:22.045 --> 01:18:23.283
Can't wait to get you home.

01:18:23.307 --> 01:18:25.657
Go back to just the way we were.

01:18:26.919 --> 01:18:29.463
Go back to the way we were?

01:18:29.487 --> 01:18:31.944
Folding his socks
and cooking his dinner

01:18:31.968 --> 01:18:34.207
whilst he plays golf?

01:18:34.231 --> 01:18:38.254
He did travel halfway around
the world to get me, though.

01:18:38.278 --> 01:18:41.455
And I'm sure all marriages
have their rough patches.

01:18:47.418 --> 01:18:50.136
Hang on. That's...

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.311
It's George.

01:18:51.335 --> 01:18:53.226
Married.

01:18:53.250 --> 01:18:58.231
And I... don't... care...

01:18:58.255 --> 01:18:59.798
because while George Clooney

01:18:59.822 --> 01:19:02.365
is still living and breathing
in this world,

01:19:02.389 --> 01:19:04.324
he will serve as a reminder,

01:19:04.348 --> 01:19:06.543
a shining beacon
to women everywhere

01:19:06.567 --> 01:19:08.458
that we deserve better.

01:19:08.482 --> 01:19:09.982
Stop.

01:19:10.006 --> 01:19:11.548
I can't do this.

01:19:11.572 --> 01:19:13.507
What?
We can't do this.

01:19:13.531 --> 01:19:15.596
We've wasted so many years

01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:17.424
doing what we think
we should do.

01:19:17.448 --> 01:19:18.947
Let's not settle anymore.

01:19:18.971 --> 01:19:21.123
George didn't.
George who?

01:19:21.147 --> 01:19:23.952
Let's spend the rest of our
lives doing what we want to do.

01:19:23.976 --> 01:19:25.214
Believe me, Stephen.

01:19:25.238 --> 01:19:27.240
You'll thank me
for this one day.

01:19:33.377 --> 01:19:35.379
Who the hell is George?

01:19:36.859 --> 01:19:38.251
Poppy!

01:19:48.261 --> 01:19:50.370
So it was never
about George Clooney.

01:19:50.394 --> 01:19:53.155
It's about not giving up
on happiness,

01:19:53.179 --> 01:19:54.591
not settling for what you've got

01:19:54.615 --> 01:19:56.419
just because it seems
the easier option.

01:19:56.443 --> 01:19:58.857
Well, this certainly is
a breakthrough, Poppy,

01:19:58.881 --> 01:20:00.728
but please make an appointment

01:20:00.752 --> 01:20:02.710
so we can discuss this further.

01:20:04.277 --> 01:20:07.039
No. Thanks, you've been great,

01:20:07.063 --> 01:20:08.214
but I'm done talking.

01:20:08.238 --> 01:20:10.544
I'm going to start living.

01:20:13.286 --> 01:20:16.246
See? I'm that good.

01:20:17.116 --> 01:20:18.746
Sharon, it's Poppy.

01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:20.487
I'll do it.
I'll do the show.

01:20:20.511 --> 01:20:22.619
If other people can learn
from my failed marriage,

01:20:22.643 --> 01:20:24.230
bad sex, and sleazy threesomes,

01:20:24.254 --> 01:20:25.927
then...

01:20:25.951 --> 01:20:29.844
Oh, could you ask her to call
Poppy when she gets in? Thanks.

01:20:29.868 --> 01:20:32.891
And Sharon set me up
with a rooftop photoshoot

01:20:32.915 --> 01:20:34.240
for my last L.A. column,

01:20:34.264 --> 01:20:35.937
with a little help from Justin.

01:20:35.961 --> 01:20:38.418
Guess who is the new preferred
wedding designer

01:20:38.442 --> 01:20:39.767
at the Chic Hotel?

01:20:39.791 --> 01:20:40.942
That's fantastic.

01:20:40.966 --> 01:20:42.814
I'm so proud of you, Justin.

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:45.947
And I'm so glad that you and
Paolo are finally back together.

01:20:45.971 --> 01:20:48.123
Yeah, well, maybe I wasn't
the perfect partner

01:20:48.147 --> 01:20:49.429
I thought I was.

01:20:49.453 --> 01:20:52.021
Aw. Yeah, he begged me
to come back.

01:20:53.239 --> 01:20:56.044
There's the phone number
for Uncle Yakov.

01:20:56.068 --> 01:20:57.872
Any man give you trouble,

01:20:57.896 --> 01:20:59.091
you give him a call

01:20:59.115 --> 01:21:00.788
and he come break balls for you.

01:21:00.812 --> 01:21:02.268
Thanks, Irina.

01:21:02.292 --> 01:21:04.096
A toast to Poppy.

01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:06.054
To Poppy.

01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:09.342
Yay!

01:21:17.611 --> 01:21:20.939
Oh, they look great.
Perfect for the last column.

01:21:20.963 --> 01:21:22.244
Ms. Wakefield,

01:21:24.488 --> 01:21:26.422

01:21:26.446 --> 01:21:28.622
No, that's brilliant.
Thanks.

01:21:44.464 --> 01:21:46.790
Going down?

01:21:46.814 --> 01:21:48.967
