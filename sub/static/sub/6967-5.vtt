00:06.939 --> 00:11.741
B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O,
and Bingo was his name-o

00:11.811 --> 00:15.872
There was a farmer had a dog
and Bingo was his name-o

00:15.949 --> 00:19.885
B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O,

00:19.953 --> 00:23.821
B-I-N-G-O, and Bingo was his name-o

00:23.923 --> 00:27.825
There was a farmer had a dog
and Bingo was his name-o

00:28.428 --> 00:30.487
- Dad! What was that?
- What's happening?

00:30.930 --> 00:33.091
It's OK, it's OK. I just had a flat.

00:33.166 --> 00:35.396
- Oh, no!
- No problem here, honey.

00:54.587 --> 00:56.714
Darn it!

01:18.545 --> 01:20.274
Honey, would you hold the light?

01:20.380 --> 01:21.847
Paul!

01:30.824 --> 01:32.883
Where are you? Paul?!

01:34.360 --> 01:36.419
What happened?!

01:37.464 --> 01:39.557
Paul!

02:04.624 --> 02:06.819
Over here! I've found something!

02:19.005 --> 02:21.439
His leg's been eaten off.

02:24.611 --> 02:26.670
Hey! Up here!

02:26.746 --> 02:29.271
I need some help!

02:39.659 --> 02:42.287
It's in here! It's as tall as a house!

02:42.362 --> 02:44.887
- We can smoke him out.
- And then what?

02:49.135 --> 02:50.830
- I see it!
- He's coming at us!

03:52.031 --> 03:54.124
Agent Finley speaking.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.966
Working hard, Mulder?

04:03.109 --> 04:06.203
This woman claims she was
taken aboard a spaceship

04:06.312 --> 04:09.179
and held in an anti-gravity chamber
for three days.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.342
Anti-gravity is right.

04:13.987 --> 04:17.184
Sorry to interrupt your serious investigation.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.920
- I heard a story that'll take your knees out.
- What's that?

04:20.994 --> 04:24.361
They found a body
in the New Jersey woods yesterday,

04:24.430 --> 04:26.762
missing its right arm and shoulder.

04:26.833 --> 04:30.792
They think
they may have been eaten off... by a human.

04:31.604 --> 04:34.937
- Where in New Jersey?
- Just outside Atlantic City.

04:35.008 --> 04:38.876
Not an uncommon place to lose a body part.
They think it's the Mob?

04:38.978 --> 04:41.811
He was a homeless man. There's no motive.

04:44.784 --> 04:45.842
You feeling lucky, Scully?

04:45.952 --> 04:48.011
Relative to whom?

04:49.255 --> 04:52.190
It's not our case, Mulder.
The local police are handling it.

04:54.394 --> 04:56.294
An X-File?

04:56.396 --> 04:59.365
Ever hear of something
called the Jersey Devil?

04:59.499 --> 05:03.435
A beast that's supposed to come out
of the woods and attack cars,

05:03.503 --> 05:05.596
like an East Coast Bigfoot.

05:05.672 --> 05:08.436
Read the file about the case in 1947.

05:11.577 --> 05:13.636
Save me the trouble.

05:13.713 --> 05:17.114
1947. Family watches Dad
get dragged off into the woods.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.878
Cops find Dad
with a few appendages gnawed off.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.580
Cops corner a large,
naked man in the woods

05:22.655 --> 05:28.093
and gun him down. Autopsy shows human
flesh and bones in his intestine. A beast man.

05:28.194 --> 05:31.095
- Is the autopsy report here?
- Requisition for a car.

05:31.197 --> 05:35.133
No. The original disappeared
from the files after the incident.

05:35.268 --> 05:40.501
- There is a statement from the pathologist.
- I've heard this story since I was a kid.

05:40.606 --> 05:44.838
- It's a folk tale, a myth.
- I heard the same story when I was a kid, too.

05:44.911 --> 05:47.937
Funny thing is, I believed it. Thanks, Doreen.

05:48.047 --> 05:51.483
Fact is, we've got
a cannibalized body in New Jersey.

05:51.551 --> 05:54.247
Someone or something out there is hungry.

06:03.963 --> 06:09.333
They say animals can develop an appetite
for human flesh, but... this is no animal.

06:09.435 --> 06:12.370
See the teeth marks,
just below the clavicle?

06:12.472 --> 06:14.531
They're human.

06:14.841 --> 06:17.435
- Who found the body?
- A park ranger.

06:17.510 --> 06:19.569
Was he alive when it happened?

06:19.679 --> 06:24.946
It's hard to tell. There's no sign of a struggle.
His blood alcohol level was up.

06:25.051 --> 06:28.543
- Probably never knew what hit him.
- Any ideas about that?

06:28.654 --> 06:32.317
From the size of that bite mark,
I'd say large, adult male.

06:32.458 --> 06:35.552
- Detective Thompson is handling the case.
- Glenna?

06:35.661 --> 06:39.597
Hi. I'm Special Agent Dana Scully
and this is Agent Fox Mulder.

06:39.699 --> 06:42.998
I don't remember anybody
calling the FBI in on this.

06:43.102 --> 06:46.663
We're not here officially.
Agent Scully is a medical doctor.

06:46.739 --> 06:49.970
We heard about your victim
and thought we'd look.

06:50.576 --> 06:53.010
I'm sorry. I'm going to ask you to leave.

06:53.112 --> 06:56.775
- We have an investigation.
- Tommy, this is no time to get pissy.

06:56.883 --> 06:59.613
- We have jurisdiction here.
- Any suspects yet?

06:59.719 --> 07:01.778
I don't work for you, sir.

07:01.888 --> 07:05.688
Unless you hear from the attorney general,
this is a local matter.

07:05.758 --> 07:09.717
- Agent Mulder, we should go.
- No need to get bent out of shape!

07:09.796 --> 07:13.892
On the contrary,
I think I've been exceedingly polite.

07:22.442 --> 07:26.344
- So what's eating that guy?
- He was perfectly in his rights.

07:26.412 --> 07:30.212
The FBI has no overriding jurisdiction
in a murder case.

07:30.316 --> 07:33.342
You'd feel the same
if someone horned in on your work.

07:33.419 --> 07:38.152
Chances are, he'll be scratching his head
when they bring the next body in.

07:38.224 --> 07:43.059
You could have really humiliated him
and told him who the perpetrator was.

07:43.729 --> 07:45.788
The Jersey Devil.

07:48.434 --> 07:53.565
What do you say we grab a hotel,
take in a floor show, drop quarters in the slot,

07:53.639 --> 07:55.436
do a little digging on this case.

07:55.541 --> 07:58.032
- You're kidding?
- OK, skip the floor show.

07:58.144 --> 08:01.272
- Mulder, I have to be back in DC.
- Have you got a date?

08:02.014 --> 08:03.606
No.

08:03.683 --> 08:06.379
I have my godson's birthday party at 6.30.

08:10.556 --> 08:13.821
- What are you doing?
- A little poking around.

08:13.893 --> 08:18.557
- Maybe make a weekend out of it.
- It's a three-hour drive back by myself.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.057
In Friday night traffic.

08:31.777 --> 08:33.836
Change of fifty.

09:02.875 --> 09:06.834
I found the body just over there,
lying face down on the rocks.

09:07.880 --> 09:12.044
32 years with the Parks Service,
I've seen some weird stuff,

09:12.118 --> 09:14.052
but never anything like this.

09:14.120 --> 09:18.022
The victim was a homeless man.
You get many wandering around?

09:18.090 --> 09:21.116
Well, occasionally, you'll see some, but...

09:21.227 --> 09:23.286
most are scared of the woods.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.656
Scared? Of what?

09:25.765 --> 09:27.858
I don't know.

09:27.934 --> 09:30.027
The devil.

09:31.270 --> 09:34.762
- People say that's just a myth.
- Depends on who you talk to.

09:34.874 --> 09:36.933
What do you think?

09:37.043 --> 09:39.102
Well, like I said,

09:39.178 --> 09:41.271
32 years,

09:41.847 --> 09:43.906
I see a lot of weird stuff.

09:48.688 --> 09:50.747
Like one time,

09:51.524 --> 09:53.685
a little over four years ago,

09:55.161 --> 09:57.254
I saw what I thought was

09:57.330 --> 09:59.321
a large man

09:59.398 --> 10:03.357
come out of a copse of birch trees.
Not a stitch of clothing.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.329
He was about sixty yards away.

10:06.405 --> 10:09.738
And he starts sniffing the air,
you know, like a dog.

10:11.310 --> 10:15.713
And then he looked straight at me,
and I swear he smelled me,

10:15.781 --> 10:20.309
because he took off into the woods so fast
you'd swear he wasn't human.

10:20.386 --> 10:21.944
Really?

10:22.021 --> 10:24.114
- You never saw him again?
- No.

10:26.726 --> 10:29.092
But I feel him.

10:30.229 --> 10:33.130
And... I've found things.

10:33.199 --> 10:35.292
Some scat,

10:35.368 --> 10:38.235
half-buried, like a cat's, only more human.

10:38.337 --> 10:42.797
Found a half-eaten rabbit with
what looked like a human cuspid tooth,

10:42.942 --> 10:46.969
and deer bones, looked like
they'd been sharpened into tools.

10:47.046 --> 10:50.174
You think it's responsible
for the body you found?

10:51.550 --> 10:53.609
Well...

10:54.353 --> 10:56.821
I got a pension coming up in a few years.

10:56.922 --> 11:00.790
You know, you say the wrong thing...
I'll tell you one thing.

11:00.993 --> 11:05.225
I don't ever come out here
without my weapon any more.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.326
How far is it into town from here?

11:10.002 --> 11:12.470
About a mile, a mile and a half.

11:12.571 --> 11:16.063
I'm staying at the Galaxy Gateway
for a couple of days.

11:16.175 --> 11:19.406
- If you think of anything, will you call me?
- Sure.

11:30.623 --> 11:31.749
Look at this gorilla mask!

11:31.824 --> 11:34.759
Where am I? I can't see!

11:41.400 --> 11:43.459
It's OK. It's all right.

11:43.569 --> 11:46.060
What happened? Did you bump your head?

11:47.239 --> 11:49.298
Cruiser! Stop that!

11:51.210 --> 11:52.973
Go on.

11:53.079 --> 11:55.172
What happened?

11:55.247 --> 11:57.841
- Jungle warfare.
- I could kill that dog.

11:57.917 --> 12:01.045
If the hit squad
doesn't get to him before you do.

12:01.187 --> 12:03.246
I am so glad you're here, Dana.

12:03.322 --> 12:05.916
Hey! Get off me! Cruiser!

12:06.625 --> 12:09.025
Cruiser, get down!

12:20.206 --> 12:21.503
Oh!

12:21.607 --> 12:23.666
- You're amazing.
- What?

12:23.743 --> 12:27.338
You're a natural.
I don't know how you keep it together.

12:27.446 --> 12:29.505
Mommy radar.

12:30.116 --> 12:32.550
I don't think I'm cut out for this, EI.

12:32.651 --> 12:36.917
You went to the FBI Academy.
What better training for motherhood?

12:38.023 --> 12:41.459
Seriously. You're great with kids.
What do you mean?

12:41.627 --> 12:45.085
- When do I find the time?
- First you have to get a life.

12:45.264 --> 12:47.755
Of course, it helps if you can find a man.

12:47.867 --> 12:50.961
- Know of any?
- They're disappearing faster

12:51.070 --> 12:53.334
than the Brazilian rainforest.

12:53.439 --> 12:56.306
- What about that guy you work with?
- Mulder?

12:56.375 --> 13:00.937
- I thought you said he was cute.
- He's ajerk. He's not ajerk. He's...

13:01.046 --> 13:03.037
He's obsessed with his work.

13:31.944 --> 13:34.469
Hi. I'm Rob. Scott's dad.

13:34.547 --> 13:37.573
- Oh! Come in.
- Thanks.

13:37.683 --> 13:39.082
Hey, tiger!

13:39.151 --> 13:42.609
How you doing?
You having a good time?

13:42.721 --> 13:44.780
Divorced.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.724
Did anybody here know Roger Crockett?

14:32.271 --> 14:34.865
He was murdered two days ago.

14:40.212 --> 14:41.440
Ma'am, can I...

14:44.817 --> 14:46.751
Roger Crockett?

14:46.819 --> 14:48.684
Anybody?

14:52.658 --> 14:54.751
What do you want to know?

14:54.827 --> 14:56.886
Did you know Roger Crockett?

14:56.996 --> 14:59.055
Did you hear how he died?

14:59.164 --> 15:01.223
Yeah.

15:01.667 --> 15:04.158
Any ideas who might have done it?

15:04.770 --> 15:06.829
You a cop?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.999
No, I'm FBI.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.635
I'll show you something.

15:12.711 --> 15:14.110
OK.

15:20.853 --> 15:22.912
I need some money.

16:07.266 --> 16:10.758
- What is this?
- Stuck in the pocket of ajacket I found.

16:12.237 --> 16:14.296
Does it mean anything to you?

16:14.373 --> 16:16.466
- I've seen it.
- Where?

16:16.742 --> 16:19.438
- Right here, digging in the trash.
- Here?

16:19.878 --> 16:21.937
Are you hustling me?

16:22.047 --> 16:24.106
Swear to God.

16:24.283 --> 16:26.774
- What do you think it is?
- I don't know.

16:26.885 --> 16:28.944
It scared the hell out of me.

16:29.054 --> 16:32.785
- Has anybody else seen it?
- Everybody's pretty freaked.

16:32.891 --> 16:36.554
- Anybody told the cops?
- You think they don't know?

16:42.368 --> 16:46.668
- Where are you sleeping tonight?
- You're standing in my bedroom.

16:46.772 --> 16:49.138
You know the Galaxy Gateway?

16:50.476 --> 16:52.535
Room 756.

16:54.179 --> 16:56.272
Go ahead.

16:59.218 --> 17:00.981
They got HBO?

17:02.888 --> 17:03.912
Yeah. They do.

19:35.140 --> 19:36.198
Sir?

19:36.275 --> 19:39.301
- You got a man up on that roof.
- Nothing to be afraid of.

19:39.378 --> 19:43.041
- We can give you a warm place to sleep it off.
- Hey! Back off!

19:43.148 --> 19:45.946
- There's a man up on that roof!
- Get in the car! Now!

19:53.358 --> 19:58.591
- What the hell are you doing?!
- Enjoying the nightlife here in Atlantic City.

19:59.932 --> 20:02.162
I'll go right to the DA's office if I have to.

20:02.267 --> 20:06.397
- Obstructing an investigation. Misconduct.
- Let's go see her together.

20:06.505 --> 20:10.532
- We could add "withholding evidence".
- What are you talking about?

20:10.609 --> 20:14.705
Statements given to you
describing something stalking the city.

20:14.780 --> 20:18.978
This is the fishing trip they get me up
at three in the morning for?

20:19.318 --> 20:20.683
Unbelievable!

20:20.752 --> 20:25.314
Why else would you be sweeping the streets
tonight? You know it's out there.

20:25.390 --> 20:27.483
I got a perpetrator out there.

20:27.559 --> 20:32.394
Whether it's Hannibal the Cannibal or
Elmer Fudd, I've got ajob to protect people.

20:32.497 --> 20:37.400
Is that yourjob? Or is it to keep
the dice rolling? The tour buses rolling in?

20:37.502 --> 20:42.701
You can't fill those casinos, this town
disappears like a quarter down the slot.

20:43.942 --> 20:45.375
I've seen it.

20:46.178 --> 20:47.577
Seen what?

21:01.927 --> 21:05.363
You've been spending too much time
in supermarket checkout lines.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.920
That story's as old as the hills.

21:06.999 --> 21:11.936
Who's gonna be responsible
when you lose your first tourist, Detective?

21:12.004 --> 21:14.063
- You are.
- No, you are, sir.

21:14.172 --> 21:18.768
Because you're wasting my time
and impeding the solution of this case.

21:18.844 --> 21:21.369
You wanna go on a safari, go to Africa.

21:21.446 --> 21:24.574
In the meantime,
enjoy the rest of your weekend.

21:37.829 --> 21:39.490
Agent Scully!

21:39.598 --> 21:41.657
Agent Mulder, line three.

21:44.002 --> 21:46.061
Where are you?

21:46.171 --> 21:50.267
- Not far from where you left me.
- You're still in Atlantic City?

21:50.409 --> 21:53.037
Scully, you got anything
happening this morning?

21:53.111 --> 21:54.703
What's that noise in the background?

21:59.885 --> 22:03.844
- That's a guy getting sick.
- Mulder, where are you?

22:03.922 --> 22:06.220
The drunk tank?

22:11.263 --> 22:14.790
It's not hard to see
why they mistook you for a vagrant.

22:16.068 --> 22:19.834
Are you gonna rag on me
or take me to get something to eat?

22:19.905 --> 22:24.740
Am I buying? Or did you manage to
panhandle some change while you were at it?

22:24.843 --> 22:27.334
It moved like a cat. Quick and graceful.

22:27.479 --> 22:30.812
There's no way a human could've
gotten up on the roof that fast.

22:30.882 --> 22:33.817
- Mulder...
- What?

22:33.885 --> 22:36.410
What happens when word
gets back to the Bureau?

22:36.521 --> 22:39.615
They dropped the charges.
Thompson did it to spite me.

22:39.691 --> 22:44.526
- I'm talking about this Jersey Devil.
- It's exactly like the ranger described.

22:44.629 --> 22:47.063
The way it moved, sniffed the air...

22:47.132 --> 22:50.363
- It's probably in search of food.
- Yeah, I'll say!

22:50.535 --> 22:54.437
It was in the garbage.
If it was a man-eater, why didn't it go for me?

22:54.539 --> 22:59.875
- It probably felt threatened.
- You've already given it a motive and alibi.

22:59.945 --> 23:03.745
It chewed somebody's arm off.
Hardly a defensive posture.

23:03.849 --> 23:08.479
- You do believe I saw something?
- You saw something, I'll give you that.

23:08.587 --> 23:12.148
But I'm not about to go in and sell
a sighting in a dark alley.

23:12.257 --> 23:17.661
- I've still got a hotel room I'm paying for.
- I have to get back to Washington by 7.30.

23:17.729 --> 23:20.857
- Got another birthday party?
- No.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.792
I have a date.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.165
Can you cancel?

23:30.142 --> 23:34.101
Unlike you, Mulder...
I would like to have a life.

23:35.313 --> 23:36.473
I have a life.

23:39.885 --> 23:43.878
Come on. I have somebody I want you
to meet on the way home. Come on.

23:43.955 --> 23:45.013
Hold on.

23:45.157 --> 23:49.423
Just about every culture has one.
Yeti, Sasquatch,

23:49.528 --> 23:51.553
Russian almas, sonnequat.

23:51.696 --> 23:55.496
- Why is that?
- It's a universal wild-man myth.

23:55.567 --> 23:59.833
A fear of our dual natures as humans,
as creators of life and destroyers of it.

23:59.938 --> 24:03.738
- What's this chart?
- It shows the historic entry of man

24:03.809 --> 24:07.711
onto each continent,
and the effect on other species,

24:07.779 --> 24:10.942
- which, as you see, has been disastrous.
- Why?

24:11.183 --> 24:17.019
We humans have retained hereditary traits
that have proven to be extremely destructive.

24:17.222 --> 24:20.623
We tend to be tribal, aggressively territorial,

24:20.759 --> 24:24.160
oriented by selfish sexual
and reproductive drives

24:24.229 --> 24:28.928
that make co-operation beyond the family
or tribe extremely hard for us.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.662
We kill other species in order to survive?

24:31.803 --> 24:34.465
Humans sit at the top of the food chain,

24:34.573 --> 24:37.838
and we reduce other species'
chances of survival.

24:37.976 --> 24:41.002
I'm glad Dana left here
with more than a degree!

24:41.079 --> 24:44.048
What if something
entered the food chain above us?

24:44.149 --> 24:48.142
It won't happen.
Our intelligence virtually ensures that,

24:48.220 --> 24:53.157
barring the introduction of alien life,
we will live our days as rulers of the world.

24:53.225 --> 24:56.194
But what if, by some fluke of nature,

24:56.261 --> 25:01.824
a human was born who reverted to its most
animal instincts? A carnivorous Neanderthal.

25:01.900 --> 25:04.494
Wouldn't he be above us on the food chain?

25:04.603 --> 25:09.040
Sure. All he'd have to do is wait
outside any fast-food restaurant

25:09.107 --> 25:11.598
and eat us on the way in.

25:11.676 --> 25:15.203
Haven't there been cases
of men raised in the wilderness

25:15.280 --> 25:18.716
by animals who have no language
and hunt like predators?

25:18.850 --> 25:21.080
Several. But cannibalism is rare.

25:21.186 --> 25:24.986
- Even among the lower mammals.
- When faced with extinction?

25:25.056 --> 25:27.456
Maybe in the jungles of New Guinea...

25:27.526 --> 25:31.053
It's highly unlikely
that what you're suggesting

25:31.129 --> 25:34.121
could have survived
in the woods of New Jersey.

25:34.232 --> 25:39.226
Highly unlikely, but not outside
the realm of extreme possibility?

25:41.139 --> 25:44.506
Well, it would be an amazing discovery.

26:22.147 --> 26:24.843
The hard thing was when my wife remarried.

26:24.916 --> 26:28.079
I felt very competitive for my son's attention.

26:28.153 --> 26:30.246
- It was weird.
- I'm sure.

26:30.322 --> 26:33.291
I became a superdad
on the weekends with Scott.

26:33.358 --> 26:36.384
I had this unconscious fear of being replaced.

26:36.494 --> 26:40.328
I had dreams where I was running
over his stepfather with my car.

26:41.766 --> 26:45.896
You'll understand when you have kids.
They change everything.

26:45.971 --> 26:48.303
That's what they say.

26:50.075 --> 26:53.602
Maybe some weekend
we could take the kids to the beach.

26:54.946 --> 26:58.109
- Yeah!
- Great.

26:58.183 --> 27:00.276
Thank you.

27:01.353 --> 27:04.584
Can I ask about the case you're on,
or can't you say?

27:08.426 --> 27:11.953
I don't think it's a case
we should discuss over dinner.

27:12.097 --> 27:17.034
I don't suppose you want to hear about the
finer points of estate planning and taxation?

27:35.754 --> 27:37.312
Mulder.

27:37.389 --> 27:40.847
This is Peter Brullet
of the Jersey Parks Department.

27:40.959 --> 27:42.426
Oh, yeah. Hi.

27:42.527 --> 27:47.555
I found a body out in the woods today,
looks like it's been dead six to eight months.

27:47.632 --> 27:51.932
A long-haired male, missing
the same tooth I found in that rabbit.

27:52.003 --> 27:54.665
- Could be your devil.
- Where's the body now?

27:54.773 --> 27:57.936
- With the coroner's offiice.
- You're sure it was a male?

27:58.009 --> 28:00.000
It had all the plumbing.

28:00.145 --> 28:02.272
Excuse me.

28:06.751 --> 28:08.810
I'm sorry.

28:12.557 --> 28:14.616
Excuse me.

28:18.229 --> 28:20.993
- Scully.
- Mulder.

28:21.066 --> 28:24.797
- Sorry to interrupt your evening.
- That's OK. What's up?

28:24.903 --> 28:27.599
I just had an amazing thought.

28:28.073 --> 28:31.600
Maybe it isn't a beast man
we're looking for, after all.

28:40.652 --> 28:45.783
If they picked it up, nobody logged the body
on the chart. I sure haven't seen it.

28:45.857 --> 28:48.382
What else would they have done with it?

28:48.460 --> 28:50.690
We may have called you for nothing.

28:50.795 --> 28:54.094
- They're trying to sweep it under the carpet.
- Why?

28:54.199 --> 28:59.034
Any publicity, and the streets are crawling
with people who aren't playing crap tables.

28:59.104 --> 29:01.595
Word gets out it's on the loose, forget it.

29:01.673 --> 29:04.642
- You said it was a female?
- The body was a male.

29:04.709 --> 29:08.110
There's a chance there was a mate.
We have to find out.

29:08.213 --> 29:11.080
What are the chances of capturing it alive?

29:12.250 --> 29:16.118
If it is a primate,
it would have a natural fear of heights.

29:16.221 --> 29:18.246
It would also want to stay close
to its food source.

29:18.490 --> 29:20.651
This thing has no fear of heights.

29:20.725 --> 29:24.126
We'll stay together
and start with the lower floors.

29:24.229 --> 29:28.427
- How much time will that dart give us?
- It'll put down a bear for an hour.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.331
If I hit it.

30:03.067 --> 30:06.730
- What's a park-ranger vehicle doing here?
- I don't know.

30:07.772 --> 30:10.263
Check it out.

30:13.278 --> 30:14.609
Run a check for me.

30:36.434 --> 30:37.628
There's something here!

30:42.407 --> 30:46.400
It's blood.
She could be bringing her killing here.

30:46.744 --> 30:48.803
She could be injured.

30:51.115 --> 30:53.606
Roger. Zebra Team in position.

31:31.823 --> 31:34.291
What if it is a female, Scully?

31:35.894 --> 31:37.987
How close is she to you or me?

31:38.062 --> 31:40.155
Does she feel emotion?

31:40.231 --> 31:43.257
Or are her days just spent... looking for food?

31:45.169 --> 31:47.399
Maybe she spends her day shopping.

31:50.909 --> 31:54.072
Eight million years out of Africa.
We're not all that different.

31:56.814 --> 32:01.513
We've put men into space. Built computers
that work faster than the human mind.

32:01.619 --> 32:06.784
While we overpopulate the world and create
new technologies to kill each other with.

32:06.858 --> 32:09.452
Maybe we're just beasts with big brains.

32:11.429 --> 32:13.488
What?

32:13.598 --> 32:17.534
No, I was just... thinking about
my godson's birthday party.

32:18.736 --> 32:24.106
Eight little six-year-old boys running around.
Talk about primitive behavior!

32:24.208 --> 32:27.006
Mulder. He's a federal agent.
Ever hear of him?

32:27.078 --> 32:27.942
No.

32:28.046 --> 32:29.343
- You know him?
- No.

32:29.447 --> 32:33.315
- What are you doing here?
- I'm a professor of anthropology.

32:33.418 --> 32:36.444
Mulder. That sound familiar?
I know he's here.

32:36.521 --> 32:40.855
Check upstairs, Andrew.
I want this place searched top to bottom.

32:50.134 --> 32:52.227
Move! Move!

33:18.596 --> 33:20.689
Mulder!

33:22.100 --> 33:24.159
Mulder, where are you?

36:41.399 --> 36:42.730
Mulder?!

36:46.270 --> 36:48.363
Scully!

36:51.909 --> 36:53.968
Lay back.

36:54.378 --> 36:56.471
Mulder, you're hurt!

36:57.181 --> 36:59.274
You should have seen her.

36:59.383 --> 37:01.476
She was beautiful.

37:01.552 --> 37:03.952
She just about ripped your lungs out.

37:04.722 --> 37:09.625
She could have torn my head off, but
she didn't cos she sensed I wasn't a threat.

37:09.727 --> 37:12.958
I need federal jurisdiction on this case.
Mulder!

37:13.030 --> 37:16.989
- How old would you say she was?
- The assistant DA's on the phone.

37:17.101 --> 37:22.334
- He wants to know what the hell is going on.
- Tell him he's got a Neanderthal on the loose.

37:22.440 --> 37:25.841
- She was young.
- The Crime Unit has filed a complaint

37:25.943 --> 37:28.935
that we're endangering
a murder investigation.

37:29.013 --> 37:32.915
- That is such crap.
- They've got her cornered in a building.

37:34.785 --> 37:36.514
- Can you see it?
- It crawled into the wall.

37:36.587 --> 37:38.919
- Can you get a man in there?
- Affirmative.

37:40.625 --> 37:43.753
- Keep these people out of here!
- Take her alive!

37:44.629 --> 37:46.529
What's going on in there?

37:46.597 --> 37:50.226
I've got a man down! A naked woman
jumped from the second story!

37:50.334 --> 37:53.394
Suspect is headed south
into the woods on foot!

38:10.288 --> 38:13.348
I know these woods.
She'll be down by the rocks.

38:36.380 --> 38:38.439
Look.

38:41.485 --> 38:43.612
Can you reach her from here?

38:43.688 --> 38:45.781
I can try.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.508
It tried to take my arm off.

40:13.611 --> 40:15.704
Why did you have to kill her?

40:17.915 --> 40:20.213
Same reason you kill a rabid animal.

41:02.259 --> 41:04.352
Hi. This just came through.

41:04.428 --> 41:07.761
It's a posthumous medical exam
of the woman's body.

41:07.832 --> 41:12.166
They found fragments of human bones
still in her digestive tract.

41:12.236 --> 41:14.966
They estimated her age to be 25 to 30 years.

41:15.039 --> 41:19.567
Now, they allowed Dr Diamond
to do a medical exam of the body,

41:19.643 --> 41:25.047
but he found nothing that suggested
prehistoric bone structure or physiology.

41:25.149 --> 41:27.743
Now, the ACPD has her listed as a Jane Doe.

41:27.818 --> 41:32.755
A search for her identity in state
psychiatric records has begun in earnest.

41:32.823 --> 41:36.589
- Good luck.
- They have also released the medical exam

41:36.660 --> 41:39.094
from the male body that they found.

41:39.196 --> 41:41.790
His age is estimated to be about 40 years.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.995
There would have been offspring.

41:46.370 --> 41:50.466
The medical exam of the woman's uterus
does indicate that she may have given birth.

41:50.574 --> 41:54.510
She was just protecting her children.
It all makes sense.

41:54.612 --> 41:57.706
The male dies
and she comes out in search of food.

41:57.815 --> 42:01.251
Mulder, do me a favor.
Go and have a beer. Take the day off.

42:01.318 --> 42:04.446
I'll cover for you.
Just take some time for yourself.

42:04.522 --> 42:07.047
I've got an appointment at the Smithsonian

42:07.124 --> 42:10.321
with an ethno-biologist.

42:11.729 --> 42:13.629
Mulder.

42:13.697 --> 42:17.224
Yeah, just a second. It's for you.

42:21.071 --> 42:23.869
- Hello?
- Hi, Dana. It's Rob.

42:23.941 --> 42:25.408
Oh, hi.

42:25.476 --> 42:29.242
Sorry to call you at work,
but I have Scott for the night

42:29.313 --> 42:34.615
and we have tickets for Cirque de Soleil.
We thought you and Trent could join us.

42:40.057 --> 42:42.548
Requisition for a car, please.

42:43.227 --> 42:45.695
Thank you.

42:51.569 --> 42:53.662
Who was that on the phone?

42:53.737 --> 42:55.830
- A guy.
- A guy?

42:55.906 --> 42:58.136
Same guy you had dinner with?

42:58.242 --> 43:01.541
- Same guy.
- Are you gonna have dinner with him again?

43:01.645 --> 43:03.704
- I don't think so.
- No interest?

43:03.781 --> 43:06.375
- Not at this time.
- Thanks, Fran.

43:08.252 --> 43:11.881
- What are you doing?
- Going with you to the Smithsonian.

43:11.956 --> 43:16.393
- Don't you have a life, Scully?
- I'll hurt you like that beast woman.

43:16.493 --> 43:18.723
Eight million years out of Africa.

43:18.796 --> 43:20.889
And look who's holding the door.

43:30.074 --> 43:32.770
- Dad, did you just see something?
- Where?

43:32.876 --> 43:35.367
- Over there.
- I'm sure it was nothing.

43:35.479 --> 43:39.506
- No, I saw something.
- Ever hear the story of the Jersey Devil?

43:39.583 --> 43:42.711
When I was a kid,
my dad used to tell this story

43:42.786 --> 43:45.755
about a creature who lived out in the woods.

43:45.823 --> 43:47.916
It was half-man, half-animal.

43:47.992 --> 43:50.085
I used to believe that story.

43:51.305 --> 43:57.265
