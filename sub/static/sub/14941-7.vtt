Huh. There's something
in the stomach wound.

04:30.871 --> 04:34.644
Looks like... Coffee grounds.

04:34.645 --> 04:36.806
It's from an ulcer.

04:36.807 --> 04:38.408
The brown color is caused

04:38.409 --> 04:40.810
by the blood mixing
with the stomach's acid.

04:40.811 --> 04:43.683

weapon brought it to the surface.

peroxide interacts

I thought pro bono work

Look, Manny is a good
kid. He just messed up.

08:58.609 --> 09:01.641
The problem is, the prosecution
wants to try him as an adult,

09:01.642 --> 09:04.744
which could mean serious jail time.
He doesn't have a birth certificate?

09:04.745 --> 09:06.916
No, he's illegal. Ah.

09:06.917 --> 09:08.818
His mom died
about two years ago,

09:08.819 --> 09:10.950
so he's been living with his
uncle, who... also illegal. Got it.

09:10.951 --> 09:13.252
So you need me to verify
Manny's age? All right.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.224
Why don't you bring
him in on Monday?

Yeah, sure. 'Cause, you know,

Uh...

10:11.742 --> 10:13.042
No.

You're providing transportation
for your child and her friends.

10:16.386 --> 10:20.319
It's called parenthood. Now

10:32.663 --> 10:35.064
Got it covered.

10:35.065 --> 10:38.938
It appears ed was
an excellent father.

10:38.939 --> 10:42.171
And yet, you still think
his wife could've done this?

10:42.172 --> 10:45.274
The stab to the left
ventricle is what killed him.

10:48.919 --> 10:51.020
The wounds are
6 1/2 inches deep,

10:51.021 --> 10:52.882
cut by a unique blade.

10:52.883 --> 10:56.225
Uh, the surfaces were
punctured at entry, not cut.

10:56.226 --> 10:58.227
Both sides were serrated.

10:58.228 --> 11:02.892
What kind of knife is
completely serrated?

11:02.893 --> 11:06.136
Ed made furniture, didn't he?

11:09.399 --> 11:11.871
I walked in,

11:11.872 --> 11:15.304
and, uh, it was quiet.

11:15.305 --> 11:18.778
And... I went to go...

11:18.779 --> 11:20.149
Check on Sophie.

11:20.150 --> 11:22.081
And...

11:22.082 --> 11:25.255
And that's when... (Cries)

11:27.317 --> 11:30.459
And, uh, what did you do next?

11:30.460 --> 11:33.963
(Crying) I, uh, I knelt
down next to him,

11:33.964 --> 11:35.795
and...

11:35.796 --> 11:38.397
He wasn't breathing.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.170
And then I called
9-1-1, but I knew...

11:41.171 --> 11:44.073
Your son seemed
a little surprised

11:44.074 --> 11:46.736
that you had come
home for lunch.

11:46.737 --> 11:49.338
Ed s... ed said he was
having problems with the baby,

11:49.339 --> 11:52.211
so he called, and I came.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.284
Do you come home
for lunch often?

11:55.285 --> 11:57.286
As often as I can.

11:57.287 --> 12:00.449
(Sniffles) It hasn't exactly
been easy with the baby.

12:00.450 --> 12:02.952
And Mike... how's he been?

12:02.953 --> 12:05.094
(Sniffles) You know boys.

12:05.095 --> 12:08.197
They're not exactly baby crazy.

12:08.198 --> 12:10.830
(Morris) Mm-hmm.
But he's a great kid,

12:10.831 --> 12:13.803
and he's really gonna
have to step up now.

12:13.804 --> 12:16.806
All right, Jen. Thanks.

12:16.807 --> 12:18.268
(Man) Mrs. Russell.

12:21.071 --> 12:24.343
(Sniffling)

12:24.344 --> 12:26.846
(Lowered voice) So she
stabs him, he goes down,

12:26.847 --> 12:29.849
and then she stabs him a few
more times for good measure.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.221
Okay, so now it's a mess,

12:32.222 --> 12:33.924
and?

12:36.256 --> 12:39.258
(Normal voice) Voilà. She
grabs one of these to clean up.

12:39.259 --> 12:42.792
And calls 9-1-1
before she's finished?

12:42.793 --> 12:45.434
Why clean up if you're
gonna leave the body?

12:45.435 --> 12:48.197
Murder's not a clearheaded act.

12:48.198 --> 12:49.869
Mnh-mnh. No.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.271
She knew exactly
what she was doing.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.075
Maybe she was
covering for someone.

13:19.299 --> 13:22.271
What do you got?
This can't be Jen's print.

13:22.272 --> 13:24.234
But it could be her son's.

13:33.183 --> 13:35.344
(Morris) Mrs. Russell,
answer our questions.

13:35.345 --> 13:38.447
We know you cleaned
up your son's footprints.

13:38.448 --> 13:41.150
Why did you think
he killed his father?

13:41.151 --> 13:43.592
Ed had contusions
from a recent fight.

13:43.593 --> 13:46.425
Was that with your son? We confirmed
that he skipped school yesterday.

13:46.426 --> 13:50.059
Mrs. Russell, please,
just tell us where Mike is.

13:50.060 --> 13:51.830
I don't know.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.303
Am I under arrest?

13:59.209 --> 14:01.571
Sit on her till you
hear from me.

14:04.114 --> 14:07.246
She could be wrong,
you know? How's that?

14:07.247 --> 14:10.249
Yeah, she cleaned up footprints
she thought were her son's.

14:10.250 --> 14:13.482
What if she was wrong? But what
if she wasn't? We gotta talk to Mike.

14:13.483 --> 14:15.854
Good luck finding him.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.287
(Sighs)

14:18.288 --> 14:21.591
(Boys shouting indistinctly)

14:27.597 --> 14:30.099
Wow.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.371
This is some way to grieve.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.344
What do you expect me to
do, sit at home with my mom?

14:35.345 --> 14:37.146
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

14:37.147 --> 14:39.248
Unless you got something
to feel guilty about.

14:39.249 --> 14:42.351
Anything you wanna tell me?
I checked with your principal.

14:42.352 --> 14:45.214
You neglected to mention
you cut school yesterday.

14:45.215 --> 14:47.486
I went to meet someone. Who?

14:47.487 --> 14:49.488
A girl. She have a name?

14:49.489 --> 14:52.992
Carla. That's it? Carla?

14:52.993 --> 14:55.965
Look, I don't know
her last name. (Laughs)

14:55.966 --> 14:58.968
We met online. I was going
to meet her for real yesterday.

14:58.969 --> 15:00.399
Where'd you go?

15:00.400 --> 15:03.402
I didn't. I chickened out. I
went to an arcade instead.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.105
Look... Don't lie to me, kid.

15:06.106 --> 15:09.108
Your father and you had a
fight the day before he died.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.540
What'd he do,
ground you? Yeah, so?

15:11.541 --> 15:14.043
So maybe you snapped,
went into the garage,

15:14.044 --> 15:16.585
grabbed one of his tools,
stabbed him. I didn't kill my dad.

15:16.586 --> 15:18.187
Well, who did? Carla?

15:18.188 --> 15:21.020
No! I...

15:21.021 --> 15:25.224
I don't know. I...

15:25.225 --> 15:28.357
Wait. There's this guy
Jake. Sometimes he gets...

15:28.358 --> 15:31.360
My dad hires him to help
him with his furniture stuff.

15:31.361 --> 15:33.362
He might have done
it. And let me guess...

15:33.363 --> 15:37.406
This Jake... you don't know
his last name either, do you?

15:37.407 --> 15:39.538
(Boys shouting indistinctly)

15:39.539 --> 15:42.171
Hey.

15:42.172 --> 15:44.573
Any word from bud on the
son? The kid gave him a tip.

15:44.574 --> 15:47.176
He and Sam are on
their way to bargain outlet,

15:47.177 --> 15:49.979
looking for a day laborer
who worked with ed. Good.

15:49.980 --> 15:52.982
Good? I'm just... I'm having
a hard time trying to imagine

15:52.983 --> 15:55.684
what would drive him
to kill his father. Neglect?

15:55.685 --> 15:57.686
He was a stay-at-home dad,

15:57.687 --> 15:59.989
and from what I
can tell, a good one.

15:59.990 --> 16:03.032
To his baby girl, but
maybe not so much to Mike.

16:03.033 --> 16:05.964
I mean, sometimes kids get
lost in the shuffle, you know?

16:05.965 --> 16:09.568
I know we're missing something.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.540
What is that?

16:11.541 --> 16:14.243
My mom taught me that
the key to carpool is snacks...

16:14.244 --> 16:18.007
Pretzels, chocolate, gum.

16:18.008 --> 16:19.708
(Sighs)

16:19.709 --> 16:23.152
I want Lacey to like me,
not have her teeth fall out.

16:23.153 --> 16:25.384
You'll thank me
later on. Mm-hmm.

16:25.385 --> 16:28.617
Shouldn't you be going soon?

16:28.618 --> 16:30.759
Oh, damn it.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.521
W...

16:32.522 --> 16:34.263
(sighs)

16:34.264 --> 16:37.026
How many sisters?

16:37.027 --> 16:39.698
Three.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.500
Bring the bag.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.102
(Indistinct conversations)

16:43.103 --> 16:44.303
(Sighs)

16:44.304 --> 16:47.406
So we're just supposed
to believe this kid?

16:47.407 --> 16:49.408
Mike's mom's clammed up.

16:49.409 --> 16:52.181
We have no physical
evidence saying it's him.

16:52.182 --> 16:54.183
Okay, so now what?

16:54.184 --> 16:56.285
You hate your kitchen. What?

16:56.286 --> 16:59.188
Look, you can hate your
kitchen or I can hate my kitchen.

16:59.189 --> 17:02.221
(Chuckles) Like
that's gonna work.

17:02.222 --> 17:05.794
(Men speaking indistinctly)

17:05.795 --> 17:09.058
(Equipment beeping)

17:09.059 --> 17:11.560
(Men continue
speaking indistinctly)

17:11.561 --> 17:13.562
Hey, fellas!

17:13.563 --> 17:15.564
I hate my kitchen.

17:15.565 --> 17:18.207
Who's gonna help
me fall in love again?

17:18.208 --> 17:21.541
(Men continue
speaking indistinctly)

17:25.775 --> 17:27.777
Hey!

17:37.327 --> 17:39.488
(Grunts)

17:39.489 --> 17:41.460
Get up. Come on.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.192
Get up.

17:43.193 --> 17:45.194
(Grunts)

17:45.195 --> 17:47.366
Nice watch.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.798
It was a gift! Ow!

17:49.799 --> 17:51.400
Worth killing for?
(Handcuffs click)

17:51.401 --> 17:52.802
Come on. Come on.

18:01.511 --> 18:03.783
I don't believe it.

18:09.459 --> 18:11.120
Hi.

18:11.121 --> 18:13.292
Hello. I'm Lacey's mom.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.294
Nice to meet you. Hello.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.695
Hi. Hi.

18:16.696 --> 18:19.529
You're late and
working. Uh, sorry.

18:23.733 --> 18:26.135
Okay. Who are you?

18:26.136 --> 18:29.478
I'm Peter. I work with your
mom. On dead people?

18:29.479 --> 18:31.480
Well, that's right.
As a matter of fact,

18:31.481 --> 18:34.483
there was a guy killed
yesterday named ed Russell,

18:34.484 --> 18:36.885
and we're trying to find out
who did it. (Mouths words)

18:36.886 --> 18:39.489
And, uh, you could
give your mom a break.

18:44.354 --> 18:46.125
(Sighs)

18:48.298 --> 18:51.801
Okay, so... Who
wants a tasty kake?

18:53.863 --> 18:56.505
Ed gave me the watch as payment.

18:56.506 --> 18:58.867
He was short on cash.

18:58.868 --> 19:00.609
So why'd you run away?

19:00.610 --> 19:02.741
Who knows what you're
trying to put on me?

19:02.742 --> 19:04.743
You mean like,
uh, burglary, theft,

19:04.744 --> 19:07.876
trafficking in stolen
property? Read your rap sheet.

19:07.877 --> 19:10.349
Things have a way of going
missing when you're around.

19:10.350 --> 19:15.484
I didn't take anything from ed. Really?
Because we found this rasp in your tool chest.

19:15.485 --> 19:18.587
It's the same length as the
one ed was murdered with.

19:18.588 --> 19:21.590
Now we're about to send this
to the lab to test for his blood,

19:21.591 --> 19:25.894
unless you wanna
save us some time.

19:25.895 --> 19:28.467
Ed was my friend.

19:28.468 --> 19:32.401
He knew I had some trouble
in the past. He cut me a break.

19:32.402 --> 19:34.874
I swear to you,
I didn't kill him.

19:36.506 --> 19:38.508
(Elevator bell dings)

19:42.181 --> 19:45.183
Hi. Todd Fleming. I'm
here to see... good morning.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.655
Dr. Murphy, hi.

19:46.656 --> 19:49.888
How are you? This is
my client, Manny Santos.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.520
Hello, Manny. Hello.

19:51.521 --> 19:53.191
(Clicks tongue)

19:53.192 --> 19:55.924
Well, establishing an exact
age scientifically is problematic.

19:55.925 --> 19:57.866
I mean, nutrition, genetics,

19:57.867 --> 19:59.798
childhood trauma...
Can all influence growth.

19:59.799 --> 20:02.271
We can run an
epiphyseal plate evaluation,

20:02.272 --> 20:04.373
but just by eye, I can tell you

20:04.374 --> 20:07.236
his subcutaneous adipose
tissue appears prepubescent,

20:07.237 --> 20:10.309
as does his lack of facial
hair and muscle definition.

20:10.310 --> 20:14.243
Of course, there is an easy
way to determine puberty.

20:14.244 --> 20:17.246
You want me to do what? Check
the Tanner stage of development

20:17.247 --> 20:20.389
of his you know whats. This is
way beyond my job description.

20:20.390 --> 20:24.493
I need this determination as soon as
possible. Then you check his you know whats.

20:24.494 --> 20:26.925
You're a doctor. I don't
see him letting me do it.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.927
¿Qué está pasando?

20:28.928 --> 20:31.760
Tengo que chequear sus cojones.

20:31.761 --> 20:34.763
Are sure you don't want
one? The girls loved 'em.

20:34.764 --> 20:36.565
Yeah, they lovedyou.

20:36.566 --> 20:39.838
I thought you were with
your daughter today. So did I.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.271
We heard that you might
have the murder weapon.

20:42.272 --> 20:44.643
Mm-hmm. Looks like a fit.

20:44.644 --> 20:48.517
Yeah, except forensics
didn't find any blood.

20:48.518 --> 20:50.248
Hold on.

20:50.249 --> 20:54.323
There's something in
the subcutaneous tissue.

20:54.324 --> 20:56.024
Huh. Ethan?

20:56.025 --> 20:57.357
Yeah?

21:06.936 --> 21:09.598
Hmm.

21:09.599 --> 21:11.600
They look like...

21:11.601 --> 21:13.802
Fish scales.

21:13.803 --> 21:15.274
Hmm.

21:22.682 --> 21:24.683
(Ethan) They
didn't come from ed,

21:24.684 --> 21:27.786
so they must be transfer
from the killer, right?

21:27.787 --> 21:30.789
Well, I've heard of guys using
a rasp to take off fish scales,

21:30.790 --> 21:33.061
so maybe he works in a
supermarket, a restaurant...

21:33.062 --> 21:35.764
Pet store? Okay,
maybe not a pet store.

21:35.765 --> 21:37.826
Guys, they're not fish scales.

21:37.827 --> 21:40.799
They're flakes of human skin.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.832
(Cell phone alert chimes)

21:44.674 --> 21:47.676
(Gasps) Lacey.

21:47.677 --> 21:50.339
I think you'll be
fine on your own.

21:50.340 --> 21:51.640
(Sighs)

21:51.641 --> 21:56.816
Get me an h&e stain and
call me with the results.

22:01.020 --> 22:04.953
So how was riding class?

22:04.954 --> 22:06.755
Okay.

22:06.756 --> 22:09.698
(Girl) How's your case going?

22:09.699 --> 22:12.831
My what? Ed
Russell? Peter told us.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.933
Oh.

22:14.934 --> 22:17.936
Uh, the police think it
was the teenage son.

22:17.937 --> 22:20.939
What do you think? I
hate to think that any child

22:20.940 --> 22:23.672
could hate their
parent that much.

22:23.673 --> 22:27.115
(Cell phone rings)

22:27.116 --> 22:30.348
Go ahead, Ethan. Okay.

22:30.349 --> 22:34.553
I've got the stain. What am I looking
for? Mild regular epidermal acanthosis

22:34.554 --> 22:36.785
with overlying hypogranulosis.

22:36.786 --> 22:39.788
Okay... check...

22:39.789 --> 22:42.691
And... check...

22:42.692 --> 22:44.092
And check.

22:44.093 --> 22:46.094
Do you see any plugging

22:46.095 --> 22:48.096
of the follicular orifices?

22:48.097 --> 22:50.899
Um, uh, hold on. Just, uh...

22:50.900 --> 22:53.402
Yes. Yes, I do. Um...

22:53.403 --> 22:56.705
But... but it's not eczema.
There-there's no inflammation.

22:56.706 --> 22:58.807
It's ichthyosis. It's a
hereditary disease.

22:58.808 --> 23:02.611
Uh, you're gonna have to
run the d.N.A. To confirm it,

23:02.612 --> 23:05.854
but tell bud whoever killed
ed Russell has peeling skin,

23:05.855 --> 23:08.757
like the aftermath of a sunburn.

23:08.758 --> 23:11.590
Okay, I'll let him
know right now. (Beep)

23:11.591 --> 23:14.663
(Beep) Okay, I just gotta
tell you, that was awesome.

23:14.664 --> 23:17.866
(Girl) Oh, my gosh. (Laughs)

23:17.867 --> 23:20.470
(Girls laugh)

23:23.172 --> 23:25.103
Okay.

23:25.104 --> 23:26.676
Drop 'em.

23:30.880 --> 23:33.683
(Snaps gloves)

23:40.890 --> 23:43.892
Guess who diagnosed
some ichthyosis?

23:43.893 --> 23:46.455
I don't wanna know. Ethan.

23:46.456 --> 23:47.856
Seriously, don't tell me.

23:47.857 --> 23:49.859
Shut up and get over here.

23:56.105 --> 23:57.136
Hi.

23:59.739 --> 24:03.872
What do you make of this?

24:03.873 --> 24:06.945
You're gonna need
a full body X-ray.

24:06.946 --> 24:09.948
You can put it down.

24:09.949 --> 24:13.081
(Morris) Roll up your sleeves.

24:13.082 --> 24:15.083
Don't you need a warrant?

24:15.084 --> 24:17.686
No. We caught you with
the dead guy's watch,

24:17.687 --> 24:21.630
and you're worried about a warrant? Ed's
killer had a skin condition called ichthyosis.

24:21.631 --> 24:23.632
Now roll up your sleeves,

24:23.633 --> 24:26.636
or the warrant I get will
be for a cavity search.

24:38.978 --> 24:42.581
Have a nice day.

24:42.582 --> 24:44.683
That's it?

24:44.684 --> 24:48.056
Yep. Get him outta here.

24:48.057 --> 24:49.187
(Moans)

24:49.188 --> 24:50.790
Let's go.

24:53.092 --> 24:56.094
To your right, down the hall.

24:56.095 --> 24:57.696
(Sighs)

24:57.697 --> 25:00.899
Any other symptoms
come with this condition?

25:00.900 --> 25:03.501
Sweating... the only way
the body releases heat...

25:03.502 --> 25:06.905
Some breathing problems...
Congestion, asthma.

25:06.906 --> 25:08.106
Asthma?

25:08.107 --> 25:11.010
(Snaps gloves) Yeah. Why?

25:13.282 --> 25:16.284
(Voice breaking) I don't
know where Mike is.

25:16.285 --> 25:20.148
He didn't come home after his
football game? And I'm starting to worry.

25:20.149 --> 25:24.223
That's why we got this
warrant to search Mike's room.

25:30.900 --> 25:33.902
(Peter) Mike has
ichthyosis, doesn't he?

25:33.903 --> 25:37.535
What does that have to do with
anything? Yesterday at the police station,

25:37.536 --> 25:39.537
you couldn't look
him in the eye...

25:39.538 --> 25:41.539
Because you were
looking at his feet

25:41.540 --> 25:43.672
to see if he had blood
on them. (Gasps)

25:43.673 --> 25:45.114
Sam.

25:54.553 --> 25:57.325
(Crying) Please, just stop.

25:57.326 --> 26:01.660
I know this must be
impossible for you.

26:01.661 --> 26:04.733
(Peter) Mrs. Russell,
what happened?

26:04.734 --> 26:06.294
Why were they fighting?

26:06.295 --> 26:09.237
(Jen) Ed wanted to
take Mike's computer,

26:09.238 --> 26:12.170
and Mike was so angry.

26:12.171 --> 26:14.843
I... I just can't believe

26:14.844 --> 26:17.777
that he would do
something so horrible.

26:27.256 --> 26:31.690
Okay. Here are all the posts
between Mike and Carla.

26:31.691 --> 26:33.692
Uh, looks like they
met on this site.

26:33.693 --> 26:36.324
There's a lot of getting-
to-know-you stuff at first,

26:36.325 --> 26:38.326
but then Carla
wants specifics...

26:38.327 --> 26:40.629
Uh, school, grade,
hair color, birthday...

26:40.630 --> 26:42.971
Pretty soon Mike's just
pouring out his heart.

26:42.972 --> 26:46.274
"He's on my ass all the
time." "Can't do anything right."

26:46.275 --> 26:48.637
"Wants to take my
computer away."

26:48.638 --> 26:51.309
Which would mean good-bye, Carla. And
hello, motive. They've been talking about

26:51.310 --> 26:53.311
getting together
and running away.

26:53.312 --> 26:56.184
So ed finds out, tries to stop
him. That's the final straw.

26:56.185 --> 27:00.118
Mike kills him. And winds up missing
his rendezvous with Carla. Look.

27:00.119 --> 27:03.321
Sent today... "hey. Sorry
I missed you yesterday.

27:03.322 --> 27:06.324
Are you still here?
I'm ready to run."

27:06.325 --> 27:10.328
They're meeting at 3:00
P.M. today at Felicia's coffee.

27:10.329 --> 27:12.330
(Morris) Way to go, Neal.

27:12.331 --> 27:15.103
I ask you for an
epiphyseal plate evaluation,

27:15.104 --> 27:17.305
and you do a full
set of body x-rays?

27:17.306 --> 27:18.907
Take a guess why.

27:18.908 --> 27:21.139
Dr. Hunt starting
to rub off on you?

27:21.140 --> 27:22.671
No.

27:22.672 --> 27:24.142
Well, yes, actually.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.775
Take a look.

27:26.776 --> 27:30.319
(Man and woman
speaking indistinctly)

27:46.195 --> 27:49.898
Todd, what happens if
Manny is ruled a minor?

27:49.899 --> 27:51.900
Typically, six months in juvie.

27:51.901 --> 27:55.073
But I'll be pushing for his immediate
release on probation. And then back home?

27:55.074 --> 27:58.306
Yeah, that's the idea. Why?

27:58.307 --> 28:00.749
(Sighs)

28:00.750 --> 28:02.881
Well, you can see from
these growth plates,

28:02.882 --> 28:05.253
his leg bones haven't even
begun to fuse like an adult's.

28:05.254 --> 28:06.855
He's definitely a minor.

28:06.856 --> 28:09.257
But he can't go back home.

28:09.258 --> 28:13.021
I saw cigarette burns on
his abdomen and upper legs.

28:13.022 --> 28:15.894
The x-rays show
recently healed broken ribs

28:15.895 --> 28:18.897
and a fractured humerus. And it's
all happened within the last two years,

28:18.898 --> 28:20.969
since he's been
living with his uncle.

28:20.970 --> 28:24.203
It's consistent with physical abuse. We're
not sending the kid back to his abuser.

28:26.435 --> 28:30.108
Wait. Hold on a second. Are
you saying you won't testify?

28:30.109 --> 28:32.710
You want him to go to jail?

28:32.711 --> 28:34.112
Of course not.

28:34.113 --> 28:36.115
What we're saying is,
figure something out.

29:39.809 --> 29:42.981
He wanted to take your computer
away. That doesn't mean I killed him.

29:42.982 --> 29:46.214
This will, Mike. Plus, we know
you planned to run away with Carla.

29:46.215 --> 29:49.517
And how do you explain this?

It's a shame.

29:59.568 --> 30:02.831
Ed Russell works his whole

This is his reward?

30:04.373 --> 30:06.275

30:24.253 --> 30:26.995
A 15 year old stabs
his father to death

30:26.996 --> 30:31.499
because he threatens to
take away his computer?

30:31.500 --> 30:34.502
And it eludes you, doesn't it?

30:34.503 --> 30:36.834
Yeah. Then figure out why.

30:36.835 --> 30:40.238
I thought we didn't
care about the why.

30:40.239 --> 30:44.173
Dr. Hunt, Ethan is
calling for you in the lab.

30:47.276 --> 30:50.418
So that was quite something
you did today... full body x-rays

30:50.419 --> 30:52.420
and an independent
radiology report?

30:52.421 --> 30:54.983
That's at least
$1,000 off the books.

30:54.984 --> 30:59.058
He's a lawyer. I figured
we'd stick him for it. (Laughs)

31:01.460 --> 31:02.931
What's this?

31:02.932 --> 31:04.993
Don't tell anybody
I gave it to you.

31:04.994 --> 31:06.395
You'll ruin my rep.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.541
(Elevator bell dings)

31:13.542 --> 31:15.503
You wanted to see me?

31:15.504 --> 31:17.505
Yeah. So I ran Mike's d.N.A.

31:17.506 --> 31:19.507
Against the flakes
we found on ed.

31:19.508 --> 31:21.049
It's a match, but it's
only a partial one,

31:21.050 --> 31:23.051
so... so either the test failed

31:23.052 --> 31:25.513
or the flakes are
from ed somehow,

31:25.514 --> 31:27.986
except... except ed
didn't have ichthyosis.

31:27.987 --> 31:30.558
So how did his son
get it if it's hereditary?

31:30.559 --> 31:34.322
Find Peter. Tell him what you did
told me. Wait. What did I just tell you?

31:34.323 --> 31:38.166
That ed wasn't Mike's
father. (Whispers) Of course.

31:38.167 --> 31:41.899
What'd you dig up on Jen Russell?
Her real name is Jennifer Burke.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.902
We ran her name wide and
tracked her back to Arizona,

31:44.903 --> 31:46.935
where 15 years ago, she
filed domestic abuse charges

31:46.936 --> 31:50.078
against one Tim scanlan. Looks
like she took off with baby Mike

31:50.079 --> 31:52.380
and changed her name
when she married ed.

31:52.381 --> 31:54.182
Detectives.

31:54.183 --> 31:56.284
We've got scanlan.

31:56.285 --> 31:58.686
Son of a...

31:58.687 --> 32:00.918
He was in the coffee shop.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.551
Sitting right behind you,
which makes him Carla.

32:03.552 --> 32:05.693
I tracked back the I.P. Address

32:05.694 --> 32:08.226
of their first communication
about a year ago.

32:08.227 --> 32:10.598
It goes to this halfway house in
flagstaff. That's where scanlan

32:10.599 --> 32:13.431
had just gotten out of prison
on an attempted murder charge.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.633
He's been on every major
networking site ever since,

32:15.634 --> 32:18.606
posing as Carla, looking
for a 15-year-old boy,

32:18.607 --> 32:22.270
same description as
Mike. Where's Mike now?

32:22.271 --> 32:24.473
He's still in custody.
What about Jen?

32:41.460 --> 32:44.463

I-I tried calling. I-I
need to talk to you.

32:59.248 --> 33:02.250
Ed wasn't Mike's
biological father,

33:06.055 --> 33:08.256
Please leave me alone.

33:08.257 --> 33:12.060

father killed your husband.

W-Wait. Do you
hear what I'm saying?

33:15.324 --> 33:17.165
Mike's innocent.

33:17.166 --> 33:21.469
Just tell me that I'm right, and the
police will release him. You're wrong.

33:21.470 --> 33:24.302

He didn't.

36:49.808 --> 36:51.909
He wanted Mike.

36:51.910 --> 36:56.584
His plan was to lure
Mike away from the house

36:56.585 --> 37:00.518
and then tell him he
was his real father.

37:00.519 --> 37:02.250
(Doorbell rings)

37:02.251 --> 37:04.522
But Mike was a no-show,

37:04.523 --> 37:07.295
so Tim came here to the house.

37:07.296 --> 37:09.997
Ed was working when he arrived.

37:09.998 --> 37:12.630
Tim probably knew
enough about your family

37:12.631 --> 37:15.002
to talk his way in.

37:15.003 --> 37:16.705
(Tim) Good-looking kid.

37:20.739 --> 37:24.442
(Megan) I'm guessing
that it was the photos

37:24.443 --> 37:26.544
that made him snap.

37:26.545 --> 37:29.246

(Beethoven's

37:50.839 --> 37:53.301
(Megan) You came
home, saw the footprints,

37:53.302 --> 37:55.503
and assumed they were Mike's.

37:55.504 --> 37:58.776
How could you have ever
known that they were his father's?

37:58.777 --> 38:01.509
(Sniffles)

38:01.510 --> 38:04.953
(Police radio chatter)

38:07.686 --> 38:09.817
Oh.

38:09.818 --> 38:12.820
(Radio chatter continues)

38:12.821 --> 38:15.723
(Man) Okay, great. Thanks.

38:15.724 --> 38:18.727
(Radio chatter continues)

38:23.502 --> 38:26.805
(Both speaking indistinctly)

38:39.388 --> 38:41.719
(Man) Hang in there, kid.

38:41.720 --> 38:44.653
Your mom will be here soon.

(Police radio chatter)

39:05.644 --> 39:07.114
What's this?

39:07.115 --> 39:10.618
It's a children's home. One of
my colleagues is on the board.

39:10.619 --> 39:12.580
Manny will need a sponsor...

39:12.581 --> 39:15.853
A business professional
who'll give him a part-time job.

39:15.854 --> 39:20.127
You want me to hire him? Just put
him to work a couple hours a week.

39:20.128 --> 39:22.590
I don't know if my
firm will go for this.

39:22.591 --> 39:24.992
Aw, come on. It's great p.R.

39:24.993 --> 39:28.736
And it's not too bad
for the soul either.

39:28.737 --> 39:30.969
(Chuckles) Yeah.
