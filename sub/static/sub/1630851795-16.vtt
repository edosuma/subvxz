[steven ray tickle]
<i>  this time on moonshiners...</i>

00:10.077 --> 00:12.444
We're gonna dig a trench
down to the 'still site

00:12.446 --> 00:15.147
<i>  that we can gravity feed</i>
<i>  right down to the 'stills.</i>

00:15.149 --> 00:18.450
<i>  That's gonna make our</i>
<i>  'still site that much</i>
<i>  more undetectable.</i>

00:20.154 --> 00:22.287
[tim smith] whoo!
Lot of action
going on over here.

00:22.289 --> 00:24.156
<i>  How many agave go in there?</i>

00:24.158 --> 00:25.724
[carlos camarena]
<i>  about 45 tons,</i>

00:25.726 --> 00:29.128
enough to produce about
5,000 liters of tequila.

00:29.130 --> 00:31.764
[mike cockrell] what the hell
have you brought me to?
This is field corn.

00:31.766 --> 00:33.132
This ain't sweet corn.

00:33.134 --> 00:35.868
-You walk around
in them overalls every day.
-So what does that mean?

00:35.870 --> 00:38.570
Well, it means that
everybody that wears overalls
is not no farmer.

00:40.374 --> 00:43.142
<i> [man] this is how we make</i>
<i>  the moonshine!</i>

00:48.249 --> 00:49.214
[josh owens] man,
this is sweet.

00:49.216 --> 00:50.482
Needs a little work,

00:50.484 --> 00:53.485
but I think this could
be frickin' super cool.

00:53.487 --> 00:57.890
[narrator]
<i>  in franklin county, virginia,</i>
<i>  josh needs a place to stay.</i>

00:57.892 --> 01:01.827
<i>  So henry and kenny</i>
<i>  decide to kill two birds</i>
<i>  with one stone</i>

01:01.829 --> 01:05.531
<i>  by moving josh into</i>
<i>  a century-old farmhouse,</i>

01:05.533 --> 01:09.268
<i>  which will become</i>
<i>  the control center</i>
<i>  for a new 'still site.</i>

01:09.270 --> 01:11.870
I broke up with my girlfriend,
I had to move out.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.405
I need a place to stay.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.007
Man, this is nice, right here.

01:15.009 --> 01:17.076
-[henry law] check
the inside out?
-[josh] heck yeah.

01:17.078 --> 01:18.577
Besides being a moonshiner,

01:18.579 --> 01:20.946
henry's a real estate investor
and a landlord.

01:21.115 --> 01:22.981
[henry] hell yeah.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.683
[josh] needs a little work,
but damn.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.885
[henry] you didn't think you'd
get a taj mahal, did you?

01:26.887 --> 01:28.153
Josh, he's been having
a rough time lately

01:28.155 --> 01:30.222
and he was telling me
he needed a place to live.

01:30.224 --> 01:33.125
<i>  Well, I got a place that</i>
<i> some people just moved out of.</i>

01:33.127 --> 01:35.894
That's a bathroom right there.
Big old kitchen.

01:35.896 --> 01:37.596
<i>  Not only is it pretty good</i>
<i>  for josh,</i>

01:37.598 --> 01:39.198
<i>  it has some of the best</i>
<i>  well water.</i>

01:39.200 --> 01:40.766
<i>  Best I've ever seen.</i>

01:40.768 --> 01:43.135
I think we can work us
in and get josh in that house,

01:43.137 --> 01:44.670
and maybe make
a little bit of liquor there.

01:44.672 --> 01:45.971
[henry] look at that view.

01:46.907 --> 01:49.341
-You do like to hunt, right?
-You know I do.

01:49.343 --> 01:50.742
[henry] 300 acres of land.

01:50.744 --> 01:51.710
I'm gonna be in business.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.846
I can... When can I bring
my stuff over here?

01:53.848 --> 01:56.849
<i>  Living in the middle</i>
<i>  of frickin'</i>
<i>  grand central station</i>

01:56.851 --> 01:57.816
<i>  for hunting and fishing</i>

01:57.818 --> 02:00.052
and making moonshine.

02:00.054 --> 02:01.720
So it don't get much better
than that.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.222
I'm appreciative
for this right here,

02:03.224 --> 02:05.991
I've been needing a place
and this fits me perfectly.

02:05.993 --> 02:07.659
I got room to put
all of my stuff.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.962
Hunting and fishing
and [bleep] country,

02:09.964 --> 02:12.231
-and being able to run
my 'still, making money...
-Making money.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.933
Josh, he's loving it.
He's all excited about it.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.835
[josh] some painting
and some new carpet.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.036
[henry] vacuum this up.

02:18.038 --> 02:19.972
[kenny law] what's wrong
with this? It's brand-new.

02:19.974 --> 02:21.573
<i> [josh] the house needs</i>
<i>  a little work.</i>

02:21.575 --> 02:23.142
That ain't really that
big a deal.

02:23.144 --> 02:25.144
<i>  It's just a little work here,</i>
<i>  a little work there,</i>
<i>  some painting...</i>

02:25.146 --> 02:27.146
This place is gonna be great.

02:27.148 --> 02:29.548
[henry] right here is a key,
down here
is the downstairs basement.

02:29.550 --> 02:32.918
Down here is where we're
planning on operating
everything from.

02:32.920 --> 02:36.989
This operation here
that we set up is unusual,
to say the least.

02:36.991 --> 02:39.725
<i>  We're gonna set up</i>
<i>  our 'still site about</i>
<i>  100 yards below the house.</i>

02:39.727 --> 02:42.661
<i>  But water, fuel, electricity,</i>

02:42.663 --> 02:44.897
<i>  everything will be operated</i>
<i>  from the house.</i>

02:44.899 --> 02:47.266
There'll be no tracks
going to the 'still site.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.901
Everything will be hidden.

02:48.903 --> 02:52.004
<i>  That should give us</i>
<i>  a lot of security there.</i>

02:52.006 --> 02:53.272
A lot of room
to store liquor down here.

02:53.274 --> 02:54.940
[josh coughs]

02:55.276 --> 02:57.376
damn, bro, what the hell
is that smell?

02:57.378 --> 02:59.178
-What smell?
-It's moldy as [bleep]
in here.

02:59.180 --> 03:00.512
Moldy?

03:01.315 --> 03:03.015
-Damn, bro.
-Everything's perfect.

03:03.017 --> 03:04.383
[josh] I can't do it.

03:04.385 --> 03:06.285
[henry] what's he
talking about?
Where's he going?

03:07.321 --> 03:09.488
[josh retching]

03:10.591 --> 03:12.491
ugh! [retches]

03:12.493 --> 03:15.727
[coughs] ugh.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.829
[kenny] basement make
you sick, josh?

03:17.831 --> 03:19.364
-I can't deal with mold, bro.
-[kenny] you can't?

03:19.366 --> 03:20.566
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.067
It tears me up bad.

03:22.069 --> 03:24.002
-You a country boy?
-[kenny] he comes
from the city.

03:24.004 --> 03:25.971
Would he come from the city?
I don't think... [laughs]

03:25.973 --> 03:28.173
-you can tell it,
even to how he sits.
-[laughs] okay, sorry.

03:28.175 --> 03:29.575
The house is great.

03:29.577 --> 03:30.943
<i>  But at this point in time,</i>

03:30.945 --> 03:34.046
there's no way I'll be in that
basement mixing up anything.

03:34.048 --> 03:35.747
[henry] instead of going
in that basement,

03:35.749 --> 03:37.583
we could use this, possibly.

03:37.585 --> 03:38.917
Operate everything
from right here.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.953
My plan was to work out
that basement.

03:40.955 --> 03:42.788
We could work everything
from the ground levels

03:42.790 --> 03:43.722
<i>  instead of going down</i>
<i>  the steps.</i>

03:43.724 --> 03:45.257
<i> [kenny] those steps is rough.</i>

03:45.259 --> 03:47.993
But you know,
you run into situations
like josh with that mold.

03:47.995 --> 03:50.996
<i>  Yeah, we're figuring out</i>
<i>  what to build here</i>
<i>  beside the house.</i>

03:50.998 --> 03:53.098
Right here is where
I'm planning on putting
the 'still site,

03:53.100 --> 03:54.466
right down through that hill.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.835
Whole key to it is,
is getting everything in there
to start with.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.036
We'll just have
to drive that down.

03:58.038 --> 04:01.640
Now, our water,
fuel, electricity,

04:01.642 --> 04:05.043
we gotta have lines buried
back up here to this building.

04:05.045 --> 04:07.279
Run it,
pump the liquor up here,

04:07.281 --> 04:08.580
cycle after cycle after cycle.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.549
No more running in and out
with a truck.

04:10.551 --> 04:13.352
We will stay secluded,
nobody will find it.
That's the key.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.821
-[josh] not as much
of a trail going to it.
-[henry] not at all.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.356
-Yeah, I got you.
-You drive in here,
you fly in here,

04:17.358 --> 04:18.790
you see nothing.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.592
-Well, I'm dying to see
where we're gonna set it.
-Let's check it out.

04:22.129 --> 04:24.296
<i> [henry] we're building</i>
<i>  to operate everything</i>
<i>  from that house.</i>

04:24.298 --> 04:26.064
Josh is living here
watching everything,

04:26.066 --> 04:27.065
if anybody comes down
to the farm,

04:27.067 --> 04:28.900
<i>  we'll know everything</i>
<i>  going on.</i>

04:28.902 --> 04:30.702
We'll be able to keep
a close eye on it.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.237
[josh] nice and thick
down here, look at that.

04:32.239 --> 04:34.406
[henry] right, that's what
we're looking for.

04:34.408 --> 04:35.941
[henry] the big
cedar's perfect.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.609
[josh] it's a good spot
right here.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.278
It'll be far enough away,
won't be able
to smell anything.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.545
Won't hear anything.

04:40.547 --> 04:42.948
So we won't have anything
but thump it out here.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.684
-And a cooling box, and never
have a track down here.
-No.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.352
-Won't nothing be seen.
-Nothing be seen.

04:47.354 --> 04:50.822
[henry] again, you got to rent
a place in your own name,
put the power in your name.

04:50.824 --> 04:53.592
The only downside to that is,

04:53.594 --> 04:56.094
if they come,
you're going to jail.
You know that.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.563
-All right.
-But you got a place to live.

04:58.999 --> 05:03.101
Power is coming from the house
which is in his name,
going to the 'still site.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.703
<i>  There's no defense</i>
<i>  against that.</i>

05:04.705 --> 05:07.306
If the law comes,
old josh is going to jail.

05:07.308 --> 05:09.775
I ain't too worried about it,
I mean,

05:09.777 --> 05:12.077
a place to hunt,
a place to fish,

05:12.079 --> 05:13.912
a place to piss off
my back porch

05:13.914 --> 05:15.714
who can't nobody
say nothing about it,

05:15.716 --> 05:17.716
this is a good 'still site
right here.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.184
-Beautiful, isn't it?
I like it.
-Yes.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.286
-[henry] let's roll with it.
-[josh] let's roll with it.

05:35.969 --> 05:38.837
[tim] whoo! Lot of action
going on over here.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.806
[carlos] so the agave
has arrived

05:40.808 --> 05:43.275
and these guys
are getting to work.

05:43.277 --> 05:45.143
<i> [narrator] in jalisco, mexico,</i>

05:45.145 --> 05:47.112
<i>  after seeing a booming market</i>

05:47.114 --> 05:49.948
<i>  for agave-based spirits</i>
<i>  in the us,</i>

05:49.950 --> 05:52.250
<i>  tim is getting</i>
<i>  hands-on experience</i>

05:52.252 --> 05:54.553
<i>  in how his neighbors</i>
<i>  to the south</i>

05:54.555 --> 05:57.389
<i>  make the original moonshine</i>
<i>  of mexico.</i>

05:57.391 --> 06:00.425
[carlos] the first step we do
by receiving the agave here

06:00.427 --> 06:02.327
is cut it in halves--

06:02.329 --> 06:04.730
I come along way just to get
to the distillery,

06:04.732 --> 06:07.032
getting to see
carlos camarena.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.735
<i>  I want to see every step</i>
<i>  how they make tequila.</i>

06:09.737 --> 06:11.903
<i>  I wanna know the history,</i>
<i>  I wanna know the process,</i>

06:11.905 --> 06:13.071
<i>  I wanna know how</i>
<i>  they distill it.</i>

06:13.073 --> 06:14.473
<i>  I wanna get the big picture.</i>

06:14.475 --> 06:18.110
And, and as you can see,
everything is very manual.

06:18.112 --> 06:21.046
<i>  -Oh, yeah, yeah.</i>
<i>  -Everything is done by hand,</i>
<i>  the harvesting,</i>

06:21.048 --> 06:23.849
the cutting the agave,
loading the ovens.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.951
And how many...
How many agave go in here?

06:25.953 --> 06:27.886
<i> [carlos] about 45 tons.</i>

06:27.888 --> 06:31.656
That will be enough to produce
about 5,000 liters of tequila.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.759
So that's about 5,000 liters
per oven.

06:33.761 --> 06:37.295
<i> [tim] so what's next</i>
<i>  after this, it goes in here</i>
<i>  and loads up?</i>

06:37.297 --> 06:39.831
We keep them cooking
for up to 48 hours,

06:39.833 --> 06:43.135
then we will open the doors
of the oven,

06:43.137 --> 06:47.839
uh, to start cooling it down
in order to have
the extraction of the juice.

06:47.841 --> 06:50.041
I was thinking to just take it
from the field and...

06:50.043 --> 06:52.944
I don't know, just squish it,
cook it, and that's it.

06:52.946 --> 06:55.647
I see that there's a lot
more process involved.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.816
Oh, it has a lot
of process but,

06:57.818 --> 07:01.953
I tell you making tequila,
it only consists
of five steps.

07:02.689 --> 07:05.957
<i>  First step in tequila</i>
<i>  production is agave.</i>

07:05.959 --> 07:07.993
If you don't have agave,
forget about the rest
of the steps.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.127
You cannot produce tequila.

07:09.129 --> 07:12.798
Second one is convert
starch into sugar.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.101
<i>  So you can use</i>
<i>  a conventional oven</i>
<i>  like we do,</i>

07:16.103 --> 07:19.371
or you can use
a big pressure cooker.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.945
And finally, distillation.

07:26.947 --> 07:30.715
<i>  What comes out</i>
<i>  of that fifth step,</i>
<i>  it is already tequila.</i>

07:30.717 --> 07:32.918
But how did you deal
with all of them,

07:32.920 --> 07:36.888
you can make from a very small
to a huge difference.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.991
And that's why there's
no two tequilas that
will taste the same.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.093
The moonshine, I'd say,
is exactly the same.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.129
-Where you grow the,
the corn,
-the corn.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.064
What kind of 'still
you process it,

07:46.066 --> 07:48.200
how you handle it
all the way to the bottle,

07:48.202 --> 07:49.601
makes a difference
in what it tastes.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.770
That's what makes
a difference.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.772
<i> [tim] you know whether it was,</i>
<i>  uh, moonshining,</i>

07:53.774 --> 07:55.907
<i>  or making tequila, uh,</i>

07:55.909 --> 07:57.809
we're a lot closer
than we thought.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.978
<i>  Even though we're from</i>
<i>  two nationalities,</i>

07:59.980 --> 08:03.315
it's a lot of appreciation
I think is going
hand in hand here.

08:03.317 --> 08:05.016
[carlos] we come from
different parts of the world,

08:05.018 --> 08:07.419
working with different
raw materials,

08:07.421 --> 08:09.621
-yup.
-But doing the same thing.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.490
-Exactly.
-And doing it with hearts.

08:11.492 --> 08:13.091
-That is important.
-That's what counts, is here.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.026
-That's what counts,
is right here. Yes.
-Yes.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.242
So what's the deal
with the sweet corn?

08:30.244 --> 08:34.212
Well, the lady,
she wants some good
sweet corn squeezing's.

08:34.214 --> 08:36.248
-Are you serious?
-I'm serious.

08:36.250 --> 08:39.885
I mean she was pretty damn
specific on what she wanted.

08:39.887 --> 08:42.053
[narrator]
<i> it's sevier county, tennessee.</i>

08:42.055 --> 08:46.091
<i> Mike and jerry are on the hunt</i>
<i>  for the fresh sweet corn</i>
<i>  they need</i>

08:46.093 --> 08:49.928
<i>  to close a late season deal</i>
<i>  with a discerning buyer.</i>

08:49.930 --> 08:53.098
Now, she didn't specifically
say what type of sweet corn,

08:53.100 --> 08:55.767
-so that makes it easier
on us, you know?
-Yeah.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.202
<i> [mike] you know,</i>
<i>  a few weeks ago</i>

08:57.204 --> 08:59.905
me and jerry,
we got a special order from
one of our main customers.

08:59.907 --> 09:03.208
<i>  But you know,</i>
<i>  with jerry being sick</i>
<i>  and my wedding...</i>

09:04.244 --> 09:05.610
<i>  We ain't got nothing</i>
<i>  started yet.</i>

09:05.612 --> 09:07.245
It's a total different
flavor between

09:07.247 --> 09:10.148
say, sweet corn
right off the cob
and out of the field,

09:10.150 --> 09:13.218
as there is field corn
that's ground into a meal

09:13.220 --> 09:15.086
that we're used to making
corn liquor out of.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.022
Oh, wait a minute.

09:17.024 --> 09:19.190
So you don't want to do this
as a regular like, dried corn
like we normally do.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.993
We're going to directly
scrape it off the cob
into the barrel.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.062
We're gonna scrape it
off the cob into the barrel.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.730
We're just gonna get
a good, full, rich,

09:25.732 --> 09:27.732
sweet corn flavor out of it.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.101
Well, we got to make some
mashed taters and gravy
to go with it.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.137
[laughs] which is fine
if we have to do it, brother.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.838
This should be pretty simple
to, uh, create,

09:33.840 --> 09:35.607
we just gotta get
the sweet corn.

09:35.609 --> 09:38.843
Let's get in here and get us
some doggone sweet corn
and go mash it in.

09:38.845 --> 09:40.178
<i>  I got this friend</i>
<i>  that owns the farm,</i>

09:40.180 --> 09:41.880
<i>  I'm going there to get</i>
<i>  what's fresh,</i>

09:41.882 --> 09:44.616
get it back here in the woods
and get it mashed in.

09:44.618 --> 09:47.085
-[mike] hardly at it, or...
-[dennis] hard at it
all the time.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.821
-How's it going, tricky?
-Ah, just peddling a little.

09:49.823 --> 09:50.822
Good, good to you.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.325
-That's jerry. Jerry, dennis.
-How are you?

09:53.327 --> 09:55.060
Well dennis,
you know what we do.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.362
We just want to do
a sweet corn run, you know,

09:57.364 --> 09:58.964
fresh off the cob.

09:58.966 --> 10:02.100
I'll tell you you're about
two weeks late, I guess.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.936
You're welcome to look at it,
see what you can do with it.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.838
All righty.
Well, that'll work,
I appreciate it, buddy.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.673
Hey, any time, mike.

10:08.675 --> 10:10.575
You know, he just tells us
to go look, see what he's got.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.711
[mike] let's go out
and see what we can find.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.913
It's any good,
we can have what we need.

10:14.915 --> 10:18.049
-[mike] it ain't
looking good, is it?
-No, it sure ain't.

10:19.052 --> 10:22.487
[mike] I can tell you right
now this ain't worth anything.

10:22.489 --> 10:25.724
This is drier than paper...
Look at this [bleep].
We can't even rehydrate that.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.993
[mike] that's like it.
That's all by god like it.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.395
[jerry benson] I bet we
couldn't make a bag
of usable corn here at all.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.097
Ugh.

10:32.132 --> 10:35.266
You know, some farmers
do a late crop of sweet corn,

10:35.268 --> 10:36.935
<i>  you know, I grew up</i>
<i>  planting it like that.</i>

10:36.937 --> 10:38.970
And I know there's somebody
'round here

10:38.972 --> 10:40.605
that's got to have
a late crop of corn.

10:40.607 --> 10:43.241
[jerry] I'll tell you what,
I know a guy that's got
a big ol' field.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.976
This field is full of corn.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.145
[mike] well, let's go see him.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.880
You know, I pass this field
all the time.

10:48.882 --> 10:51.249
<i>  I know there's plenty</i>
<i>  of corn in the field.</i>
<i>  It's nice and tall.</i>

10:51.251 --> 10:52.384
Beautiful corn.

10:53.620 --> 10:56.054
[jerry] check it out,
see what it looks like.

10:56.056 --> 10:59.190
Well, I can by god tell
what it looks like
from 'round here, jerry.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.059
What the hell
have you brought me to?

11:01.061 --> 11:04.162
<i>  It's a corn field</i>
<i>  here all right,</i>
<i>  a big damn corn field.</i>

11:04.898 --> 11:05.964
But it ain't sweet corn.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.298
This is roasting ear corn.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.034
This is field corn.
This ain't sweet corn.

11:09.036 --> 11:11.536
<i>  This is to make</i>
<i>  feed and fuel out of.</i>

11:13.006 --> 11:15.573
I thought you knew what
we was talking about, jerry.

11:15.575 --> 11:18.743
-You walk around
in them overalls every day.
-So what does that mean?

11:18.745 --> 11:21.246
Well, it means that
everybody that wears overalls
is not no farmer.

11:21.248 --> 11:22.947
I mentioned I'm not a farmer.

11:22.949 --> 11:24.816
You know, you'd think
for a feller that walks around

11:24.818 --> 11:28.119
in them overalls all the time
would know a little bit
about corn.

11:28.121 --> 11:31.189
-We gotta find something else.
-Usual as the last few,
I guess.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.024
<i> [mike] you know, our buyer</i>
<i>  knows a lot of people.</i>

11:33.026 --> 11:35.293
If me and jerry can't deliver
on this sweet corn-shine,

11:35.295 --> 11:36.995
<i>  she'll find somebody</i>
<i>  that will.</i>

11:36.997 --> 11:38.897
And if we can't, we're out.

11:38.899 --> 11:42.033
[mike] we'll just leave
the nature up to me,
how about that?

11:52.179 --> 11:54.713
-[josh] man, I'm excited
to get this done.
-[henry] I am, too.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.448
I'm glad we got paige with us.

11:56.450 --> 11:58.783
Henry's boy paige
is a awful lot of help,

11:58.785 --> 12:02.020
especially for the newer
generation of kids.

12:02.022 --> 12:04.255
[henry] here's what
planning on working on,
paige, right here.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.258
It'll come straight off of it.

12:08.595 --> 12:09.994
Send the wood about 8 feet.

12:09.996 --> 12:12.297
We can straighten
that tin up,
just slide out under it.

12:12.299 --> 12:13.998
[paige law] go right on
with it.

12:14.668 --> 12:16.167
<i> [josh] we got</i>
<i>  a new 'still site</i>

12:16.169 --> 12:19.704
<i>  and we're gonna run</i>
<i>  our 'still site from up</i>
<i>  here at the house.</i>

12:19.706 --> 12:22.207
First up is extending
this little building out.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.943
<i>  It's just too small</i>
<i>  for what we need to do.</i>

12:24.945 --> 12:26.344
We need a place to put
our proofing barrels

12:26.346 --> 12:28.947
'cause we're gonna pump
the liquor back up to the top
of the hill.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.915
Seven-and-a-half
would be right there.

12:30.917 --> 12:34.719
There's gonna be a lot
of work to do,
and I mean a lot of work.

12:34.721 --> 12:38.256
We're gonna build
his roof out
off of what's existing there.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.826
<i>  Hopefully we'll be able</i>
<i>  to tear that whole</i>
<i>  front wall half off</i>

12:41.828 --> 12:44.229
<i>  where the window's at,</i>
<i>  and just move it back</i>

12:44.231 --> 12:45.930
about 8 feet and put it
right back on,

12:45.932 --> 12:47.532
<i>  and frickin' be ready to go.</i>

12:53.707 --> 12:55.306
[henry] so, paige,
what you got to keep in mind,

12:55.308 --> 12:57.642
a moonshiner has to know
how to do all this stuff.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.210
You got to do
a little comms work,

12:59.212 --> 13:01.946
plumbing work,
electrical work.
Evading the law.

13:01.948 --> 13:04.382
<i>  I want to start teaching</i>
<i>  my son the way my dad did me.</i>

13:04.384 --> 13:08.086
<i> When I put him with kenny law,</i>
<i>  josh owens, and tickle,</i>

13:08.221 --> 13:09.587
that's the best of the best.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.890
My son's gonna learn
from the best of the best.

13:11.892 --> 13:14.592
Remember, as a big denizen
and a distiller
of the moonshine,

13:14.594 --> 13:16.594
they don't know half the stuff
of what we're teaching you.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.297
Normally tickle's
our lead carpenter,

13:19.299 --> 13:21.232
<i>  but he's not here today.</i>

13:21.234 --> 13:23.935
<i>  But old kenny,</i>
<i>  he ain't no slouch, either.</i>

13:23.937 --> 13:26.004
<i>  Kenny's ran some</i>
<i>  big roofing companies</i>

13:26.006 --> 13:28.273
and done tons of carpenter
work and he's pretty
damn good at it.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.742
You gotta push the button
on the side.

13:30.744 --> 13:32.177
[henry] I'm like
"kenny,cut it closer."

13:32.179 --> 13:33.812
<i>  he don't have as much</i>
<i>  to live for as I do.</i>

13:33.814 --> 13:36.648
Kenny's single,
his children are grown
and gone.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.950
[kenny] no, I ain't got
nothing to live for.
I know what henry said.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.652
[henry] that button goes
pushed in, pull the trigger.

13:40.654 --> 13:41.886
[kenny] it ain't
going in, though.

13:41.888 --> 13:43.955
-You gotta push it--
there we go.
-[chainsaw buzzing]

13:43.957 --> 13:45.824
see. I'm telling you,
it's dangerous.

13:45.826 --> 13:48.426
[chainsaw buzzing]

13:50.163 --> 13:51.563
[josh] that looks perfect,
ain't it, kenny?

13:53.834 --> 13:55.099
[kenny] all right.

13:56.570 --> 13:58.002
Now that we got
the roof built...

13:59.339 --> 14:02.140
<i>  This time we take</i>
<i>  the front wall off</i>
<i>  and move it out.</i>

14:03.009 --> 14:04.275
Aw, sheesh, man.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.978
<i> [josh] we're able to get that</i>
<i>  wall out all in one piece,</i>

14:06.980 --> 14:08.413
<i>  which is pretty awesome</i>

14:08.415 --> 14:11.216
<i>  because now we're gonna</i>
<i>  be able to just shift it</i>
<i>  on out there</i>

14:11.218 --> 14:13.117
<i>  and make that</i>
<i>  our exterior wall.</i>

14:13.119 --> 14:14.352
Pretty cool.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.355
-[josh] all right,
that's it, laws.
-[henry] looks good, josh.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.591
Just turn it back
in front here,

14:19.593 --> 14:22.026
put the door in,
and we're done.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.396
<i> [henry] so when we're done</i>
<i>  with this build,</i>

14:25.398 --> 14:26.731
that's just the beginning.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.199
<i> We've got a lot of work to do.</i>

14:28.201 --> 14:31.102
<i>  We've got to lay pipe.</i>
<i>  We've got to lay oil lines.</i>

14:31.104 --> 14:33.071
We've got to run
electric lines.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.673
<i>  We've got a lot of work</i>
<i>  ahead of us.</i>

14:35.675 --> 14:37.575
-[henry] that's closed
in, baby.
-[josh] we're good.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.756
[carlos] this oven
is completely cooked already,

14:51.758 --> 14:54.792
we will open the door
so it starts cooling down.

14:54.794 --> 14:57.028
When I first met carlos,
he took me around
his distillery,

14:57.030 --> 14:58.162
gave me a little short tour.

14:58.164 --> 14:59.797
Ohhh.

14:59.799 --> 15:03.935
<i>  But now I'm really get into</i>
<i>  how do you make tequila</i>
<i>  out of blue agave.</i>

15:03.937 --> 15:06.938
[carlos] you will notice
how good smell it is,
the sweet smell.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.706
[tim] now we got the magic.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.541
-[carlos] and the smell.
-Yeah, I can smell it.

15:10.543 --> 15:13.344
[carlos] now look
at the honey bees,
that they are coming here.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.947
-Yeah. They're coming,
trying to get--
-that sweet smell.

15:15.949 --> 15:18.349
And they are coming here
to feed.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.919
<i> [tim] well, I know</i>
<i>  automatically it's ready</i>
<i>  when I see those bees.</i>

15:20.921 --> 15:23.187
Working in the woods,
that's what we look for, too.

15:23.189 --> 15:25.757
When the mash is ready,
it's full of bees.

15:25.759 --> 15:28.660
-So now this is ready
to go to squeezing.
-That is correct.

15:28.662 --> 15:32.363
-[carlos] why don't we go
and let's go check it out?
-Let's go check it out.

15:35.035 --> 15:38.002
<i> [carlos] we bring it</i>
<i>  into this area to start</i>
<i>  squeezing the yeast,</i>

15:38.004 --> 15:42.807
cut it in small pieces
using that machine right there
and then when it comes here,

15:42.809 --> 15:44.809
<i>  we add water,</i>
<i>  extract the juice,</i>

15:44.811 --> 15:47.712
<i>  then we add water again</i>
<i>  and suck the juice again.</i>

15:47.714 --> 15:50.014
<i>  So when the agave</i>
<i>  is cooked in the oven,</i>

15:50.016 --> 15:53.017
we can have up to
30 percent sugar content.

15:53.019 --> 15:55.486
30 percent is too much
for the yeast to perform.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.822
<i>  That is why</i>
<i>  we are adding water,</i>

15:57.824 --> 16:01.025
to reduce the sugar content
from 30 to 10.

16:01.027 --> 16:04.162
With 10 percent sugar content,
then we can ferment.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.264
<i> [tim] that's a little</i>
<i>  different you know,</i>
<i>  making moonshine,</i>

16:06.266 --> 16:08.700
uh, we get the corn,
we grind it, we mash in,

16:08.702 --> 16:10.234
and we actually
add sugar to it

16:10.236 --> 16:13.037
to bring that, you know,
sugar content up.

16:13.039 --> 16:15.974
<i>  And here they're diluting it</i>
<i>  to bring it down.</i>

16:15.976 --> 16:18.977
So, carlos,
you know, I have
an engineering background.

16:18.979 --> 16:21.946
So I'm looking at how
this machine is working,

16:21.948 --> 16:25.016
<i>  but is it really</i>
<i>  engineered for this</i>

16:25.018 --> 16:26.150
or was it something else?

16:26.152 --> 16:28.286
It was engineered
for the sugarcane.

16:28.288 --> 16:31.222
-Sugarcane.
-It is a modified sugar mill.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.324
<i> [tim] this was for sugarcane</i>
<i>  in the beginning</i>

16:33.326 --> 16:35.360
and you just added a chopper
to the end.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.262
It was a sugarcane squeezer.

16:38.264 --> 16:42.000
That's a lot of mechanics
and engineering that went
into this to build it.

16:42.002 --> 16:43.668
I grew up
making molasses myself.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.269
<i>  So, it's the same concept.</i>

16:45.271 --> 16:48.940
<i>  We're trying</i>
<i>  to squeeze that juice out,</i>
<i>  so we can ferment it.</i>

16:48.942 --> 16:51.409
Making moonshine,
it's all the same.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.078
[carlos]
here's our fermentation area.

16:54.080 --> 16:57.048
-[carlos] can you smell
that agave?
-[tim] oh, I can smell it.

17:01.054 --> 17:05.256
As we use only wild juice
and the juice is
already branded in the wood.

17:05.258 --> 17:09.227
And therefore,
it will start naturally
fermenting again.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.062
So, we don't need
to add any commercial juice.

17:11.064 --> 17:14.265
Nothing. It's just allowing
mother nature to do its job.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.967
[tim] what you got floating
on top here?

17:15.969 --> 17:18.736
[carlos] these are bags
with agave pulp and fiber

17:18.738 --> 17:21.172
-in order to add
some sweetness to our tequila.
-[tim] uh-huh.

17:21.174 --> 17:24.042
And also those bags will go
into first distillation.

17:24.044 --> 17:26.544
<i> [tim] these bags</i>
<i>  are gonna kind</i>
<i>  of soak and submerge</i>

17:26.546 --> 17:28.179
<i>  into the fermentation tanks.</i>

17:28.181 --> 17:31.916
And they have that pod to add
a little bit extra character
to it.

17:31.918 --> 17:33.317
[carlos] how do we know
it is finish?

17:33.319 --> 17:35.720
Because of this white layer
which is a sign

17:35.722 --> 17:37.889
that the alcoholic
fermentation is over

17:37.891 --> 17:40.858
and we are beginning
to have a little
malolactic fermentation,

17:40.860 --> 17:44.162
meaning a little bit
of burr scotch
and cheese elements.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.097
If we allowed it
to go further

17:46.099 --> 17:48.132
than we will have
kind of like a blue cheese.

17:48.134 --> 17:50.268
And you don't want
blue cheese on your spirit.

17:50.270 --> 17:53.104
Every distiller I've met
whether it was in, uh,

17:53.106 --> 17:55.606
you know,
ireland, poland, mexico,

17:55.608 --> 17:58.543
<i> there's just one little tweak,</i>
<i>  whether it's the way</i>

17:58.545 --> 18:00.945
<i>  they set up their 'still,</i>
<i>  the way they mashed in,</i>

18:00.947 --> 18:03.581
you know, all of this
makes a difference
in that product.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.049
So if I can just get
one little thing

18:05.051 --> 18:06.951
from this one or that one
and the other one,

18:06.953 --> 18:09.120
I'm adding up
a lot of information there.

18:09.122 --> 18:11.856
[carlos] so now it comes
the moment of truth.

18:11.858 --> 18:13.925
It's the moment to taste
some tequila

18:13.927 --> 18:15.293
-and see what you think
about it.
-[tim] all right.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.694
[tim] I can't wait
to taste it.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.329
[carlos] let's go drink
some tequila.

18:33.079 --> 18:35.580
-[henry] take the turn
in here. Now we talking.
-[tickle] hot dog.

18:35.582 --> 18:38.282
-[tickle] what's up, buddy?
-[josh] tickle,
what's up, brother?

18:38.284 --> 18:40.218
All right, fellas.
How is it going?

18:40.220 --> 18:41.986
I see y'all don't need me
to build nothing.

18:41.988 --> 18:43.955
[josh] we don't fool
around the house
you know that.

18:43.957 --> 18:46.757
Yeah. Y'all gonna build
josh's his little house
right here already.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.126
-Yeah.
-Are you gonna live in that?

18:48.128 --> 18:49.927
I've been gone for a few days

18:49.929 --> 18:52.830
and they built an addition
onto this house.

18:52.832 --> 18:56.601
And, uh, they've actually
did a very good job on this.

18:56.603 --> 18:58.336
Don't look
like y'all did too bad.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.471
[henry] we got
the extension finished
on the house.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.873
So, we'll take
the turning plow.

19:01.875 --> 19:04.742
We're gonna dig this,
the trench all the way down
to 'still site.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.945
We'll have our one line
down there.
We'll have electric line.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.881
-[josh] fuel line.
-Fuel line.
All in the same ditch.

19:09.883 --> 19:12.116
-[henry] that's 300
or 400 feet we gotta dig.
-Yeah.

19:12.118 --> 19:14.685
-Well, hell, let's get to it.
-Come all the ways
down there then.

19:14.687 --> 19:17.855
<i> [narrator] to tap into</i>
<i>  the pure well water</i>
<i>  at the house</i>

19:17.857 --> 19:22.026
<i>  and hide all signs of traffic</i>
<i> in and out of the 'still site,</i>

19:22.028 --> 19:28.065
<i>  tickle, josh, henry and kenny</i>
<i>  will lay a series of pipes</i>
<i>  in a 2-foot deep trench,</i>

19:28.067 --> 19:31.169
<i>  that will run from the house</i>
<i>  to the 'still site.</i>

19:31.171 --> 19:34.939
<i>  Separate pipes</i>
<i>  will supply water and mash</i>
<i>  for the pots,</i>

19:34.941 --> 19:37.775
<i>  fuel for the burners</i>
<i>  and electricity</i>

19:37.777 --> 19:42.647
<i>  to pump the finish shine</i>
<i>  back up to the house</i>
<i>  for bottling.</i>

19:42.649 --> 19:45.216
<i> [henry] you know</i>
<i>  this site here is different</i>
<i>  from most sites we set up.</i>

19:45.218 --> 19:49.053
There's a lot of preparation
just to get it
to where we can make liquor.

19:49.055 --> 19:50.988
<i>  We could have ran</i>
<i>  that pipe down the hill</i>

19:50.990 --> 19:52.590
<i>  and just let them top</i>
<i>  the ground.</i>

19:52.592 --> 19:54.358
But you taking chance
of getting caught.

19:54.360 --> 19:57.161
<i>  If you get everything laid</i>
<i>  in the way it's supposed</i>
<i>  to be done,</i>

19:57.163 --> 19:59.130
it will stay there
a lot longer.

19:59.132 --> 20:01.265
[tickle] we'll be able
to just push that dirt
right back over it.

20:01.267 --> 20:03.834
[henry] right back over it.

20:03.836 --> 20:06.170
That as far as we gonna get
with your tractor,
ain't it, henry?

20:06.172 --> 20:07.805
[henry] yes, it is.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.307
Getting time to get something
in this thing now, ain't it?

20:09.309 --> 20:10.474
Let's get them out.
Let's do it.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.311
[tickle] you got
your big line, right yonder.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.512
[josh] that's what
I'm talking about.

20:14.981 --> 20:15.913
All right.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.815
I'm gonna start digging
this trench out.

20:17.817 --> 20:20.585
We've done dug all that out
down through there
with the tractor,

20:20.587 --> 20:22.720
but we're gonna do
this last little part
by hand.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.722
We're gonna do it by hand
because we don't know

20:24.724 --> 20:27.091
if there's
any underground pipes
setting to take lines

20:27.093 --> 20:30.094
or any electrical lines
around here
we don't know about.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.032
[tickle] don't you think
that's gonna work out good
like that?

20:35.034 --> 20:36.467
[josh]
it's gonna work real good.

20:36.469 --> 20:39.170
-Well, just kind
of flop it back.
-You gonna fold it on back.

20:39.172 --> 20:42.206
-You know what I'm saying?
-Yes, that's where
you're doing good, man.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.208
[tickle] let's get
this thing over in there.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.943
[josh]
that's gonna be beautiful.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.615
[tickle] there we go.
All right.

20:50.617 --> 20:54.518
In this trench we dug,
we're putting in an inch
and a quarter line,

20:54.520 --> 20:58.456
electric line
and fuel line in it,
and we're gonna cover it up.

20:58.458 --> 21:02.426
<i>  All we gotta do</i>
<i>  is just flip</i>
<i>  all the grass back over</i>

21:02.428 --> 21:05.730
and it's like
it never even happened.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.164
That looks all right,
right, doesn't it?

21:07.166 --> 21:09.600
[henry] I don't care
who you are,
this damn looks good.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.035
[tickle] yeah, it does.

21:11.037 --> 21:12.703
Now that we've got
our lines run,

21:12.705 --> 21:15.006
<i>  next part is bring</i>
<i>  the stills in.</i>

21:15.008 --> 21:16.307
Get them set up
and get them rolling.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.715
There's only one more guy
I meant to call.

21:24.717 --> 21:26.584
[jerry] he's got lots
of fields of stuff.

21:26.586 --> 21:28.286
And I can find out
if he's got sweet corn

21:28.288 --> 21:29.754
and see what he's got,
you know.

21:29.756 --> 21:31.789
Well, I don't have
any more damn option
so...

21:31.791 --> 21:33.291
I'm gonna give him a call
here then.

21:33.293 --> 21:34.725
But it seems like
we're kind of reaching

21:34.727 --> 21:35.893
the end of the rope here,
you know.

21:35.895 --> 21:36.994
<i>  I've got one more guy</i>
<i>  up my sleeve</i>

21:36.996 --> 21:38.763
<i>  that I kind of saving</i>
<i>  for the last option.</i>

21:38.765 --> 21:40.998
You know, this guy,
he's a heck
of a business man.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.566
<i>  If he's does have</i>
<i>  what we need,</i>

21:42.568 --> 21:44.402
it's gonna be a negotiation
like none other.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.337
Hey, man, what's going on?

21:48.007 --> 21:50.274
Yeah, busy time
of the season, huh.

21:50.276 --> 21:53.010
But we need
some good sweet corn,
still like in the field.

21:53.012 --> 21:54.412
-Fresh.
-[jerry] yeah, fresh.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.249
You got a... One field.

21:59.352 --> 22:00.618
You planted it late?

22:01.154 --> 22:02.620
Well, that sounds good, man.

22:02.622 --> 22:03.854
-He's got a field.
-Let's go look at it.

22:03.856 --> 22:05.156
You sure it's sweet corn?

22:05.158 --> 22:06.957
All right, buddy.
I appreciate it.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.896
I'm gonna tell you what.
He's a business man.

22:11.898 --> 22:14.699
This may not be something
that comes cheap.

22:14.701 --> 22:17.101
[mike] don't worry about it.
We gotta make this run happen.

22:18.771 --> 22:20.004
-What's going on, jerry?
-What's going on, man?

22:20.006 --> 22:21.439
-You doing all right?
-Long time no see.

22:21.441 --> 22:22.840
Hey, man, curly.
This is mike.
This is curly.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.008
-How you doing, sir?
-How has it been?

22:24.010 --> 22:25.309
-All right.
-I've heard a lot about you.

22:25.311 --> 22:26.844
[jerry] staying,
staying busy, huh?

22:26.846 --> 22:28.012
Wide open right now.

22:28.014 --> 22:29.880
I guess the big question is...

22:29.882 --> 22:31.749
Do you have
any sweet corn left over?

22:31.751 --> 22:33.851
I got plenty.
There's a acre left.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.753
Probably the last sweet corn
in north carolina.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.955
How much you're looking for?

22:37.957 --> 22:41.058
Well, we just, we just looking
for enough to do
what we gotta do with it.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.594
We just need enough
to make a couple rounds
of whiz and...

22:43.596 --> 22:45.029
I can part with a little,
if you only,

22:45.031 --> 22:46.530
if you can get by
with two sacks.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.265
I mean, that's about all
we'll need, right?

22:48.267 --> 22:50.968
What would you take for it?
I mean, what would you
had to have?

22:50.970 --> 22:52.336
I'll tell you
what I'd like to have.

22:52.338 --> 22:54.071
Some of that liquor.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.272
I'd rather have
that than money.

22:55.274 --> 22:57.808
How much
you get out of brewing?

22:57.810 --> 23:00.077
[jerry] I use
around four, five gallons.

23:00.079 --> 23:01.846
Um, you ain't trying telling
somebody

23:01.848 --> 23:03.781
how much liquor we yield,
are you?

23:03.783 --> 23:06.250
I'd do it for, uh, two.

23:08.221 --> 23:10.688
-That's a lot of money
-a deal is what it is.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.456
[mike exclaims]
I don't know, jerry.

23:12.458 --> 23:16.394
Couple sets of corn cost us
way damn less
than a few gallons of liquor,

23:16.396 --> 23:19.530
but we gotta have this corn
and I don't wanna leave here
without it.

23:22.034 --> 23:23.200
We might as well take it.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.102
So, you just run off
and bottle it up.

23:25.104 --> 23:27.104
It'll be here
for your tasting.

23:27.106 --> 23:29.006
-I've known jerry a long time.
-You know, man,
I'll take care of you.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.941
I ain't worried about that.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.143
-[jerry] thank you, brother.
We appreciate it.
-Appreciate it, man.

23:32.145 --> 23:33.811
-Thank you.
-All right.
Y'all have a good one.

23:33.813 --> 23:35.513
-Bye-bye. Be good, be safe.
-All right. Thank you.

23:35.515 --> 23:38.215
Told you,
a ruthless business man.

23:38.217 --> 23:41.352
I'm gonna have
to get on birth control
and wear a chastity belt.

23:43.256 --> 23:44.822
[jerry] I got us a green field
of corn, ain't it?

23:44.824 --> 23:47.558
-You see how little bitty
and short them stalks are?
-Yeah.

23:47.560 --> 23:50.961
It's still at that stage
to where it can be used.

23:50.963 --> 23:53.230
-Look at that juice
coming out of there.
-That got good juice on it.

23:55.134 --> 23:56.233
How does it taste?

23:57.003 --> 23:58.269
Sweet damn corn.

23:58.271 --> 23:59.870
It is some kind of good corn.

23:59.872 --> 24:00.971
It's sweet enough.

24:00.973 --> 24:04.608
It's real milky and creamy
and sticky, so to speak.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.110
It's got
a lot of sugar in it.

24:06.112 --> 24:07.945
So this is
what we're looking for.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.716
[mike] I've always wanted
to do this, man.

24:12.718 --> 24:14.118
[jerry] we're doing now.

24:16.722 --> 24:19.256
<i> [mike] I've never paid</i>
<i>  this much for corn</i>
<i>  a day in my life,</i>

24:19.258 --> 24:21.859
<i>  but sometimes,</i>
<i>  a man's gotta do</i>
<i>  what he's gotta do</i>

24:21.861 --> 24:22.927
<i>  to get the job done.</i>

24:22.929 --> 24:24.061
[heaves] all right!

24:24.063 --> 24:25.362
[grunts] ah!

24:25.364 --> 24:28.466
<i> [mike] our customer</i>
<i>  specifically requested</i>
<i>  sweet corn.</i>

24:28.468 --> 24:29.967
<i>  You know this lady is</i>
<i>  always looking</i>

24:29.969 --> 24:32.236
for some good,
small-batch premium liquor.

24:32.238 --> 24:33.571
We got corn in the truck, man.

24:33.573 --> 24:34.805
We got corn, bo.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.841
And ultimately,
that's where me and jerry
needed to be.

24:36.843 --> 24:40.578
High-dollar, small-batch,
premium liquor.

24:40.580 --> 24:43.047
[mike] another three days
that corn wouldn't be
good enough to pick either.

24:43.049 --> 24:44.181
[jerry] hell no.

24:54.894 --> 24:56.227
[henry] don't look
down here, innit?

24:56.229 --> 24:57.995
[josh] it's a good thing
there's plenty of cover.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.931
Now that we've got everything
run from the house

25:00.933 --> 25:02.900
<i>  down to the 'still site</i>
<i>  that we need,</i>

25:02.902 --> 25:05.402
it's time to get
this 'still site built.

25:05.404 --> 25:07.738
-[henry] we're gonna do
a double worm-up with josh.
-[josh] yeah.

25:07.740 --> 25:09.874
-A double-branch worm?
-[henry] yes, sir.

25:09.876 --> 25:11.675
That's right.
A double-branch worm.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.878
Oh, I ain't never seen
a double-branch worm.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.980
Hell, the only one
I've ever seen
is the single one we did.

25:15.982 --> 25:17.281
That was hard enough.

25:17.283 --> 25:19.083
I reckon
if anybody can do it,
it'll be us, right?

25:19.085 --> 25:20.718
-We can do it.
-[tickle] I'm all for that.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.087
<i> [tickle] normally we would</i>
<i>  just get gravity water.</i>

25:23.089 --> 25:25.322
<i>  Flow it right over into</i>
<i>  our worm</i>

25:25.324 --> 25:26.957
and cool it that way.

25:26.959 --> 25:29.960
But we'd had to go
about a half mile up
the creek

25:29.962 --> 25:31.262
<i>  and dam it up up there.</i>

25:31.264 --> 25:35.032
<i>  So, we're gonna use</i>
<i>  a branch worm</i>
<i>  on this 'still site.</i>

25:35.034 --> 25:35.966
We just dig a hole
in the creek.

25:35.968 --> 25:37.401
Put this branch worm in it

25:38.037 --> 25:41.805
<i>  and let the natural flow</i>
<i>  of the water slowly</i>
<i>  cool this liquor.</i>

25:41.807 --> 25:43.874
And it's gonna make
some darn good stuff.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.042
[tickle] where you wanna set
these pots at?

25:45.044 --> 25:46.610
Across here.

25:46.612 --> 25:47.945
That way we can put
the thumper
maybe right along here.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.580
It gonna about me
like this right here.

25:49.582 --> 25:51.348
-All right.
-Gonna fire from one end.

25:51.350 --> 25:53.117
We're gonna need one burner,
two caps.

25:53.119 --> 25:54.451
Bring them both
at the same time

25:54.453 --> 25:55.953
-into this one thumper.
-All right.

25:55.955 --> 25:57.821
[tickle] well, gotta do what
we gotta do.

25:57.823 --> 26:01.158
This thing is not
gonna be laid out
like any other 'still site

26:01.160 --> 26:02.593
<i>  we've ever done.</i>

26:02.595 --> 26:03.727
<i>  We're using an old burner.</i>

26:03.729 --> 26:06.263
So, we're gonna make
one long furnace.

26:06.265 --> 26:08.699
<i>  Think we're just gonna fire</i>
<i>  one burner down through it.</i>

26:08.701 --> 26:10.935
<i>  Run both of them at one time.</i>

26:10.937 --> 26:13.837
<i>  That means we're using</i>
<i>  the same amount of fuel</i>

26:13.839 --> 26:15.806
<i>  that we would</i>
<i>  to heat one pot.</i>

26:15.808 --> 26:17.508
But we're heating two with it.

26:17.510 --> 26:19.143
That flue look good, don't it?

26:19.145 --> 26:21.979
-[tickle] I tell you what,
it does look real good.
-Right now, it looks good.

26:21.981 --> 26:24.214
[tickle] so a little more work
to the furnace

26:24.216 --> 26:26.383
and I can definitely see
the advantage of this.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.118
Ready?

26:29.188 --> 26:30.955
-[henry] come on.
-All right.

26:30.957 --> 26:31.755
[tickle] all right.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.424
Damn thing is heavy,
ain't it?

26:34.827 --> 26:36.994
<i>  We're gonna take this rock</i>
<i>  right out of this creek.</i>

26:36.996 --> 26:39.830
<i>  And we're gonna build</i>
<i>  our furnace with that.</i>

26:39.832 --> 26:44.134
When these rock heats up,
they're gonna hold
a lot more heat

26:44.136 --> 26:46.337
than what
a normal brick would.

26:46.339 --> 26:47.972
All right.

26:47.974 --> 26:49.006
There we go.

26:49.008 --> 26:50.841
[henry] we got to brunt
this in.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.810
We gotta get
this completely airtight

26:52.812 --> 26:54.278
for those old burners
to work properly.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.980
Leave any kind of gap at all,

26:55.982 --> 26:58.916
it'll cause almost a misfire
like a smoke,

26:58.918 --> 27:00.284
and you won't get efficiency.

27:00.286 --> 27:01.785
[tickle] well, fellas.

27:01.787 --> 27:03.354
That looks like
a furnace to me!

27:03.356 --> 27:05.222
-[henry] it's looking good.
-[tickle] yes, sir.

27:08.694 --> 27:10.060
There you go.

27:10.062 --> 27:12.796
-Heat will come off
of two these.
-[josh] right.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.898
Where we've got
this coming in here,
we got 3-inch long pipes

27:14.900 --> 27:16.567
and we run them
into one thumper.

27:16.569 --> 27:19.570
We didn't have
a one branch-worm,
so we're doubling that.

27:19.572 --> 27:21.138
That's what josh
is working on now.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.906
It'll condense it
a whole lot better

27:22.908 --> 27:24.541
and make the liquor
a whole lot cooler.

27:24.543 --> 27:26.110
Won't put any back pressure
on his stills.

27:26.112 --> 27:27.845
That's the plan.

27:27.847 --> 27:30.180
We gotta support these wires.

27:34.286 --> 27:36.587
-[tickle] looks good, man.
-[henry] they actually
look good, yeah.

27:37.590 --> 27:38.956
[tickle] let's just
set this one.

27:38.958 --> 27:41.025
Get it like we want it.

27:41.027 --> 27:43.327
-And then we can just strap
the other right to it.
-[josh] all right.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.929
[tickle] all right.

27:45.931 --> 27:47.965
[henry] all right,
we need sandbags
in here now.

27:49.001 --> 27:50.134
[tickle] all right.

27:52.438 --> 27:53.771
[josh] let's see what
we can get out of that.

27:53.773 --> 27:54.905
Pack it in there.

27:54.907 --> 27:57.174
This branch worm
you gotta be very careful
with it.

27:57.176 --> 27:58.175
That's gonna be too high,
ain't it?

27:58.177 --> 27:59.677
-That's too high.
-[josh] let me see. We'll see.

27:59.679 --> 28:01.512
No, it's actually just right.

28:01.514 --> 28:05.816
It's got to drop
ever so slightly
the entire way.

28:05.818 --> 28:07.151
[josh] it's damn near level.

28:07.153 --> 28:08.986
Now all we gotta do is lay
the other one on the end.

28:08.988 --> 28:09.853
[tickle] lay the other one
on top of it.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.221
[josh] they now both be right.

28:11.223 --> 28:14.692
If it drops too quick,
your liquor
will run through it too fast,

28:14.694 --> 28:17.895
<i>  won't cool properly</i>
<i>  and you'll get harsh liquor.</i>

28:17.897 --> 28:21.999
<i>  If it doesn't drop enough,</i>
<i>  your liquor will pool up</i>
<i>  right there</i>

28:22.001 --> 28:23.867
<i>  and then</i>
<i>  you're back pressuring</i>
<i>  the still.</i>

28:23.869 --> 28:27.304
So, it's very important
to get this thing
placed just right.

28:27.306 --> 28:29.006
I say it's basically ready,
isn't it?

28:29.008 --> 28:30.774
I think it about ready
to mash.

28:30.776 --> 28:32.109
<i> [henry] I think we're ready</i>
<i>  to roll with it, too.</i>

28:32.111 --> 28:33.510
<i>  This is gonna be</i>
<i>  off the chain.</i>

28:40.019 --> 28:41.819
[carlos] now when it comes
the moment,

28:41.821 --> 28:44.722
-that if we need
to taste some, some tequila.
-To taste.

28:44.724 --> 28:46.256
-It look like
you got it set up.
-Have a seat.

28:46.258 --> 28:48.992
[carlos] let me get
some tequila.

28:48.994 --> 28:51.962
One characteristic
of tequila ocho,

28:51.964 --> 28:56.667
it is the fact
that every batch produced
comes from a different field.

28:56.669 --> 29:01.138
We will try two blancos
to see if they taste
the same or different

29:01.140 --> 29:03.273
because the process
is exactly the same.

29:03.275 --> 29:06.744
The difference is the origin,
the source of the agave.

29:06.746 --> 29:10.414
And then we will taste
reposado and anejo.

29:10.416 --> 29:13.183
All of them comes
from a different field.

29:13.185 --> 29:17.888
Well, in the beginning, uh,
carlos brings out the blanco,
this is the base product.

29:17.890 --> 29:20.390
Just like when I'm making
my moonshine,
that is my base product.

29:20.392 --> 29:25.262
[carlos] we will start
with the 2019 la coruna field.

29:26.499 --> 29:30.567
It has a lot of fruit trees
surrounding this field.

29:32.104 --> 29:37.174
The second bottle of blanco
is a 2021 harvest
from el pastizal field.

29:37.176 --> 29:39.376
-What do you think?
They smell the same?
-No.

29:39.378 --> 29:43.947
First one it has, uh,
a little bit stronger
on your nose.

29:43.949 --> 29:46.083
Uh, more, uh, earth.

29:46.085 --> 29:47.985
Getting a little bit
more peppery.

29:47.987 --> 29:50.220
-Mmm-hmm.
-The second one
is more,

29:50.790 --> 29:53.023
uh, lighter
on your nose agave.

29:53.025 --> 29:55.959
From smell, it's got a smell
like it's smoother,

29:56.328 --> 29:57.327
on the second one.

29:57.329 --> 29:59.663
The smell
is lighter and bold,

29:59.665 --> 30:00.931
-more gentle.
-[tim] yeah, it is.

30:00.933 --> 30:02.933
It's a little bit gentle
where this one's
a little bit tangy.

30:02.935 --> 30:08.172
Let's see if what the...
The nose was promising
becomes reality on the palate.

30:09.975 --> 30:11.742
To me, the first one,
I'm still getting
that dryness.

30:11.744 --> 30:17.214
-Yes.
-I'm going back to the earthy,
rocky, mineral salty taste.

30:17.216 --> 30:21.785
Whenever I taste a tequila
that has these elements,
I think highlands.

30:21.787 --> 30:23.253
And then now let's see
the second one

30:23.255 --> 30:24.888
and take this
into consideration,

30:24.890 --> 30:26.957
they are
less than a mile apart.

30:26.959 --> 30:29.259
Different altitudes
and different
growing condition

30:29.261 --> 30:30.194
for the agave.

30:31.530 --> 30:32.863
It's smoother.

30:32.932 --> 30:37.000
It's almost like my moonshine.
It has such
a rich, deep flavor.

30:37.002 --> 30:40.070
You can almost taste
the agave, like a fruit.

30:40.072 --> 30:42.105
-Yes.
-Like I'm eating it almost.

30:42.107 --> 30:44.975
-[carlos] exactly. Sweet.
-It's like I just
took a bite of it.

30:44.977 --> 30:48.111
Now the first one, uh,
I feel like it was kind
of strong on the nose.

30:48.113 --> 30:49.613
A little peppery.

30:49.615 --> 30:52.082
And more of what I would think
tequila should taste like.

30:52.084 --> 30:53.784
<i>  But when I went</i>
<i>  to number two,</i>

30:53.786 --> 30:57.855
a little bit bolder,
uh, smoother, uh,
taste profile.

30:57.857 --> 31:00.724
[carlos] and now we will taste
reposado and anejo.

31:00.726 --> 31:03.727
Very floral, I would think
on this one.

31:03.729 --> 31:07.030
-It's so, so smooth
and you wanna taste it again.
-Yes.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.966
It's like I couldn't
get enough.

31:08.968 --> 31:11.735
People think it's something
to take a shot of it,
you hold your breath

31:11.737 --> 31:13.036
<i>  and, uh, you shoot it down.</i>

31:13.038 --> 31:15.339
If you haven't had
good tequila,

31:15.341 --> 31:17.207
you don't know
what good tequila tastes like.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.008
[tim] mmm.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.776
<i>  Same as moonshine.</i>

31:19.778 --> 31:22.813
A lot of times people
get a bad taste
in their mouth upfront.

31:22.815 --> 31:24.081
They have a bad experience.

31:24.083 --> 31:26.016
<i>  And they think, well,</i>
<i>  moonshine is not for me.</i>

31:26.018 --> 31:28.652
If you don't know
what a good moonshine
tastes like,

31:28.654 --> 31:30.287
then you don't know
what it tastes like.

31:30.289 --> 31:33.557
Here in mexico, the one
who sells the most
is reposado

31:33.559 --> 31:34.758
and then blanco.

31:34.760 --> 31:38.328
So, it even depends
on which country
are you selling to?

31:38.330 --> 31:40.130
-I gotta understand
the region...
-They have a different...

31:40.132 --> 31:41.231
...And what they doing
with it.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.900
If they're making
a margarita out of it,

31:42.902 --> 31:44.234
then I would just want
the blanco.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.970
-Yes.
-'cause you don't want
any other taste...

31:46.972 --> 31:49.072
Taste profile in that
to influence

31:49.074 --> 31:50.841
what you're trying
to make in that cocktail.

31:50.843 --> 31:52.776
-Yes.
-[tim] if this one
gets better,

31:52.778 --> 31:53.810
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

31:53.812 --> 31:55.545
Let's try it and let's see.

31:58.784 --> 32:00.384
This really strong.

32:00.386 --> 32:02.886
When we got to the last one,
the anejo,

32:02.888 --> 32:04.955
which is a little bit older
in a oak...

32:04.957 --> 32:06.456
I'm getting a little pepper.

32:06.959 --> 32:10.694
This still is just as smooth
as a reposado.

32:10.696 --> 32:14.865
<i>  This the perfect balance</i>
<i>  because I'm still getting</i>
<i>  a little bit of the tequila</i>

32:14.867 --> 32:17.167
and then a little bit
of vanilla flavor
from the oak.

32:17.169 --> 32:21.204
Very smooth but usually,
at the end of the day,

32:21.206 --> 32:24.174
I will always want
to come back to this.

32:24.176 --> 32:26.043
I think
at the end of all of this,

32:26.045 --> 32:27.911
I'm gonna go sit down
somewhere.

32:27.913 --> 32:29.546
[carlos laughs]

32:29.548 --> 32:33.083
meeting carlos and spending
some time with him
is really a honor,

32:33.085 --> 32:35.852
to sit with someone like this
with the experience
that he has.

32:35.854 --> 32:37.921
I know that you are traveling.

32:37.923 --> 32:40.590
There's other regions
in mexico
who produces spirits

32:40.592 --> 32:41.658
from agave.

32:41.660 --> 32:44.728
-Agave spirits.
-Tequila, mezcal,
bacanora, sotol.

32:44.730 --> 32:47.297
-It's all
from the agave plant?
-That is correct.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.333
Everything I've learned
about making tequila,

32:49.335 --> 32:51.802
I'm gonna bring that back home
to virginia.

32:51.804 --> 32:54.604
I'm gonna try
to incorporate that
into my technique.

32:54.606 --> 32:57.140
Well, I appreciate
the opportunity
to sit with you.

32:57.142 --> 33:01.578
And I also appreciate
you teaching me each region
that these come from.

33:01.580 --> 33:03.246
Cheers for that.

33:03.248 --> 33:04.815
<i> [tim] tequila is not</i>
<i>  the only thing</i>
<i>  you can make out of agave.</i>

33:04.817 --> 33:07.617
I'm going south.
I'm going
to mezcal country now.

33:07.619 --> 33:10.787
-And thank you for being here,
again, and again.
-Yes, thank you.

33:10.789 --> 33:11.989
-Thank you.
-Gracias.

33:25.204 --> 33:26.803
[mike] good old fresh,
sweet corn.

33:26.805 --> 33:29.172
[both grunt]

33:29.174 --> 33:33.110
yeah, we finally found
the sweet corn. We're ready
to get this stuff mashed in.

33:33.112 --> 33:34.911
[jerry] I love the sound
of that waterfall.

33:34.913 --> 33:36.079
[mike] it's nice, ain't it.

33:37.750 --> 33:39.149
There we go.

33:39.151 --> 33:41.151
<i>  Yeah, you know, we're not</i>
<i>  gonna grind this corn up.</i>

33:41.153 --> 33:45.589
We're just gonna take it
and shuck it and get
the kernels off the cob.

33:45.591 --> 33:50.127
Then we can mash it all in the
barrel, cobs, kernels and all.

33:52.731 --> 33:54.064
It has a worm or two in it.

33:54.066 --> 33:55.298
[jerry] don't leave
them in there.

33:55.300 --> 33:56.700
[mike] well that
just goes to tell you,

33:56.702 --> 33:59.136
there ain't been
no poisons or nothing
sprayed on this corn.

33:59.138 --> 34:02.105
<i>  And I worked with it</i>
<i>  in this barrel, and it's</i>
<i>  sticky, damn it's sticky.</i>

34:02.107 --> 34:03.573
And it's sweet as sugar.

34:03.575 --> 34:05.742
<i>  When we eventually run this</i>
<i>  through the 'still,</i>

34:05.744 --> 34:07.611
the flavor
that I'm looking for

34:07.613 --> 34:10.914
<i>  is the flavor that's going</i>
<i>  in to the mash barrel today.</i>

34:10.916 --> 34:13.250
You've got all your cream,
your cob flavor,

34:13.252 --> 34:14.818
everything going in to it.

34:14.820 --> 34:16.686
My grandma wouldn't
waste nothing.

34:16.688 --> 34:19.156
So if she had make cream corn,
she'd cream all these cobs

34:19.158 --> 34:20.991
and she'd turn it
and make corn cob jelly.

34:20.993 --> 34:23.293
-Corn cob jelly?
-Corn cob jelly.

34:23.295 --> 34:25.896
Some of the best jelly
you'll ever put in your mouth.

34:25.898 --> 34:26.930
I ain't never heard of such.

34:26.932 --> 34:29.900
I'll get my bride to make
some corn cob jelly.

34:29.902 --> 34:34.171
-[jerry] that'd be sweet.
-It will be sweet. For sure.

34:34.173 --> 34:35.605
-[mike] ready?
-[jerry] here we go.

34:36.308 --> 34:39.309
Easy does it. Yee-haw.

34:42.881 --> 34:45.082
All right,
all right, all right.

34:45.084 --> 34:47.884
Get her back up and I'll pour
a little sugar in here.

34:47.886 --> 34:49.920
Hey, this stuff
better damn work

34:49.922 --> 34:52.789
'cause it's the last sweet
corn I'm gonna find this year.

34:52.791 --> 34:54.391
<i>  Just keep it simple,</i>
<i>  make it happen,</i>

34:54.393 --> 34:55.859
and supply our customers.

34:55.861 --> 34:57.194
Lay the water to it.

34:57.830 --> 34:59.229
By god, I just
hit that right there

34:59.231 --> 35:01.465
it ain't gonna know
what to do with it.

35:06.004 --> 35:07.737
Now that our barrel's full
of good, fresh water,

35:07.739 --> 35:09.239
and our good sugar
and our good corn,

35:09.241 --> 35:12.109
now all we got left to do
is a pinch of yeast
and let her sit.

35:12.111 --> 35:14.711
All right, just pull down hard
on that side over there.

35:14.713 --> 35:15.946
All right, let me just find

35:15.948 --> 35:17.914
just a little something
to lay on top of it that--

35:17.916 --> 35:20.250
look at you, jer.

35:21.153 --> 35:22.986
Yeah! That'll work, won't it?

35:22.988 --> 35:25.255
Now that we got our mash all
in a barrel and ready to go,

35:25.257 --> 35:27.724
<i>  it makes me feel good that</i>
<i>  we got our 'still site set up</i>

35:27.726 --> 35:29.259
and I'm really
excited about it.

35:29.261 --> 35:31.027
Got another one mashed in,
ready to go.

35:31.029 --> 35:32.129
We made it happen.

35:32.131 --> 35:34.164
[jerry] well in 10 or 12 days,
we'll be back in here

35:34.166 --> 35:36.933
to get this run-off, make some
good, fresh corn squeezing.

35:36.935 --> 35:38.101
[mike] corn squeezing.

35:44.776 --> 35:46.243
[tickle] you know,
once I cut these soy beans,

35:46.245 --> 35:48.712
you won't ever even know
this ditch is here.

35:48.714 --> 35:50.914
Look, we might be able to
make some soy bean liqueur.

35:50.916 --> 35:52.115
That's what he told me
the other day,

35:52.117 --> 35:52.749
make some soy bean liqueur.

35:52.751 --> 35:53.950
It'd be good for you.

35:53.952 --> 35:56.786
You know, it's more protein
in there than it is anything.

35:56.788 --> 35:58.588
[henry] y'all can do whatever
you want with the soy bean.

35:58.590 --> 36:00.790
They fed me enough
of that stuff in prison.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.926
-I don't want any part of it.
-You want no part of it?

36:02.928 --> 36:04.895
[henry] the soy bean burgers,
soy bean hot dog,

36:04.897 --> 36:06.196
soy bean everything, man.

36:06.198 --> 36:07.597
[tickle] fine. We just
sell this stuff

36:07.599 --> 36:09.266
to people who ain't
been to prison.

36:09.268 --> 36:11.535
That's what I was gonna say.
Ain't everybody been
as much as we have.

36:14.773 --> 36:17.941
Well, tickle, this'll be
the last trip in ya, hoss.

36:17.943 --> 36:20.243
[henry] there'll be no more
driving a vehicle
in here after this run.

36:20.245 --> 36:21.878
Work everything
from the house, huh?

36:21.880 --> 36:23.013
Everything from the house.

36:23.015 --> 36:24.314
[tickle] I can work with that.

36:25.884 --> 36:28.185
We're gonna bring
the grain in today,

36:28.187 --> 36:31.188
<i>  mash in this still site,</i>
<i> and get this truck out of here</i>

36:31.190 --> 36:33.323
and there will be no more
vehicles coming down the hill.

36:33.325 --> 36:34.491
None.

36:35.160 --> 36:36.359
We gotta get
all this hooked up.

36:36.361 --> 36:38.028
No tire run
running it down here.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.029
You ain't kidding.

36:40.365 --> 36:41.898
There you go.

36:41.900 --> 36:44.267
Everything is coming together.

36:44.269 --> 36:46.236
<i>  They'll be running water</i>
<i>  from the house,</i>

36:46.238 --> 36:48.004
coming down our pipes
that we buried.

36:48.006 --> 36:50.140
<i>  I'm really excited</i>
<i>  to get this mash build in</i>

36:50.142 --> 36:52.842
<i>  and show the guys that</i>
<i>  we gonna do a mash build</i>

36:52.844 --> 36:54.711
that hadn't been done
in years and years and years.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.846
All right,
I better get the water on.

36:56.848 --> 36:59.249
It's gonna be an amazing,
amazing liqueur.

37:00.052 --> 37:01.218
[tickle] all right.

37:01.820 --> 37:04.054
We've got the water
turned on up at the house

37:04.056 --> 37:08.925
and we're filling these
stills up with nice,
clean, well water.

37:08.927 --> 37:11.294
There you go, kenny.
We got enough in that one.

37:11.296 --> 37:13.930
You know, this ground water is
the best water you can have.

37:13.932 --> 37:15.832
As soon as you
get that thing hooked up,

37:15.834 --> 37:19.269
we'll be back ready to
go ahead and chuck in
this stuff, hot.

37:19.271 --> 37:21.905
Right now we gotta
get the heat on these stills.

37:21.907 --> 37:23.707
Get this water boiling
so we can mash it.

37:23.709 --> 37:25.208
I rigged up this thing here.

37:25.210 --> 37:27.277
It's like an air hose
from a burner.

37:27.679 --> 37:28.845
You slide it on there.

37:29.014 --> 37:31.314
So now all I gotta do is tie
this end to the proper line.

37:31.316 --> 37:33.183
I just leave it in there.

37:33.185 --> 37:34.384
I'll run to
the top of the hill

37:34.920 --> 37:36.319
and turn the oil tank on.

37:37.022 --> 37:38.955
Yeah, we ready
to cooking some mash.

37:38.957 --> 37:40.223
All right, now we're ready?

37:40.225 --> 37:41.091
Let's see what we go.

37:41.093 --> 37:42.892
I kneel down,
I hook that baby up,

37:42.894 --> 37:45.395
I slide that burner in there
and I'm crossing my fingers.

37:48.100 --> 37:49.132
Yeah, baby.

37:49.134 --> 37:50.700
[kenny] heat both up
at the same time.

37:50.702 --> 37:52.102
[tickle] that's [bleep] sweet.

37:52.104 --> 37:55.772
We've got our oil burner
going, heating this water up.

37:55.774 --> 37:59.776
It's one nice, long flame
right underneath both stills.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.678
Now you're catching
the same amount of fuel,

38:01.680 --> 38:03.046
-but you're heating two.
-Heating two.

38:03.048 --> 38:06.950
Man, and I... It just
never crossed my mind
to do it like this.

38:06.952 --> 38:08.852
[henry] so what I want to do
is bring it to a good boil,

38:08.854 --> 38:11.655
then we throw that grain
in there, let that baby
cook for an hour.

38:11.657 --> 38:13.423
And then that's when
the magic happens.

38:13.425 --> 38:17.994
This recipe that I'm doing
here, it takes so much grain.

38:17.996 --> 38:19.929
It is unbelievable.

38:19.931 --> 38:20.697
It's a trick to it.

38:20.699 --> 38:22.265
I'll set the burner down.

38:22.267 --> 38:23.967
<i> [henry] you gotta get</i>
<i>  your water exactly right,</i>

38:23.969 --> 38:26.269
you've got to add the grain
at a certain time.

38:26.271 --> 38:28.905
<i>  You've got to know</i>
<i>  when to cover it over</i>
<i>  at a certain time.</i>

38:28.907 --> 38:31.241
Then comes
what we call sweetening it.

38:31.243 --> 38:33.576
What we're doing right here,
you see all this grain?

38:33.578 --> 38:35.879
You see all that corn?
That's just the beginning.

38:35.881 --> 38:38.014
Once we get this cooked in,
we will sweeten it

38:38.016 --> 38:40.283
with a special
malted barley blend.

38:40.285 --> 38:42.786
That's what's going to end up
some of the best liqueur

38:42.788 --> 38:45.355
that you'll ever,
ever stick your lips to.

38:45.357 --> 38:47.390
My family's been doing it
for generations.

38:47.392 --> 38:49.059
This is
carrying the heritage on.

38:49.061 --> 38:52.262
<i>  It's not only</i>
<i>  an old family recipe,</i>

38:52.264 --> 38:57.067
but there's another part
to this liqueur that really
makes it so good.

38:57.069 --> 38:58.268
[henry] this is
corn meal, hoss.

38:58.270 --> 39:00.570
-Okay, so it's a mixture.
-Mixture.

39:00.572 --> 39:02.772
It's the way
that it's being made.

39:02.774 --> 39:07.077
<i>  Each of these grains</i>
<i>  have got to be layered in</i>
<i>  one at a time</i>

39:07.079 --> 39:10.814
because this water
will take on these flavors

39:10.816 --> 39:15.919
differently depending on
what we put in first,
second, third, whatever.

39:15.921 --> 39:17.487
[kenny] this is malted barley.

39:17.489 --> 39:19.823
[henry] all right, here's
the trick, you gotta put this
just the right amount.

39:19.825 --> 39:22.025
Yeah, stir it in
real good, kenny.

39:22.027 --> 39:24.327
All right, now.
One more little magic trick.

39:24.329 --> 39:28.365
-Ah! Oh, I see
the secret ingredient.
-Yeah.

39:28.367 --> 39:30.934
-Wheat ranch. Hmm.
-Ah! Don't say it
too loud, man.

39:30.936 --> 39:35.038
[tickle] well, uh, henry gets
a little crazy when it comes
time to pitch the yeast.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.173
He says the mash goes
to talking to him

39:37.175 --> 39:39.642
and he can hear it and, uh...

39:39.644 --> 39:42.045
Um, the only time it goes
to talking to me

39:42.047 --> 39:45.248
is after we're done and I'd
drink about a half a quart.

39:45.250 --> 39:46.216
Wait, what?
What's that you're saying?

39:46.218 --> 39:48.017
Wait, what it saying?
"I'll be ready"?

39:48.019 --> 39:50.720
No, she said, "henry,
put a jacket on right now."

39:50.722 --> 39:53.957
it's starting to get cold
in the evenings now.

39:53.959 --> 39:56.793
<i>  So, uh, we're covering it</i>
<i>  with insulation</i>

39:56.795 --> 39:59.162
<i>  and then throwing a layer of</i>
<i>  black paper over top of that.</i>

39:59.164 --> 40:01.297
This is the only way
you can make liqueur

40:01.299 --> 40:03.099
when your temperature
starts getting down.

40:03.935 --> 40:06.936
[henry] to do a mash build
like this, kenny,
after all these years?

40:06.938 --> 40:09.406
[kenny] it's been a long time
since you made anything
like this at home.

40:09.408 --> 40:10.240
[henry] oh, believe it.

40:10.242 --> 40:11.775
<i>  It's been a great week,</i>
<i>  you know.</i>

40:11.777 --> 40:14.811
We took all this time
to make sure we got
everything built right,

40:14.813 --> 40:16.980
bound to head on out,
get a plan together.

40:16.982 --> 40:19.315
We'll be back four
or five days to run in vegas.

40:19.317 --> 40:21.151
-[tickle] I think
we're done here.
-[henry] I think we're done.

40:21.153 --> 40:22.252
[tickle] what do
you think, henry?

40:22.254 --> 40:24.254
-[henry] I think
we're done, son.
-[tickle] all right.

40:34.032 --> 40:35.965
[tim] you can see
those mountains over there.

40:35.967 --> 40:39.269
Looks a little bit different
than mountains of tennessee,
I can tell you that.

40:40.572 --> 40:42.906
You know, I've been
a long ways all over mexico.

40:42.908 --> 40:44.908
<i>  I've been to tequila.</i>
<i>  I went to arandas.</i>

40:44.910 --> 40:47.844
<i>  But right now, we're</i>
<i>  on our way to oaxaca, mexico.</i>

40:47.846 --> 40:51.448
<i>  The very well-known location</i>
<i>  where mezcal is made.</i>

40:51.450 --> 40:53.917
Oh, no. A distillery
right there. How 'bout that?

40:53.919 --> 40:55.585
Mezcal everywhere.

40:55.587 --> 40:58.054
I'm getting ready to go down
to see xaime niembro.

40:58.056 --> 41:01.925
Xaime is part owner of
the gracias a dios distillery.

41:01.927 --> 41:03.693
Xaime is going to show me
all about mezcal.

41:03.695 --> 41:05.195
We're in mezcal country.

41:05.197 --> 41:09.098
This is where 90 percent
of mezcal is made
in all of mexico.

41:09.301 --> 41:11.267
There's another distillery.

41:11.269 --> 41:13.036
There's another one there.
Look at that.

41:13.038 --> 41:14.904
I don't know
a lot about mezcal,

41:14.906 --> 41:16.139
you know, I've had it before.

41:16.141 --> 41:17.373
I know it has a smoky taste.

41:17.375 --> 41:19.609
I know it's made from a agave.

41:19.611 --> 41:21.211
And um... You know, it's...

41:21.213 --> 41:24.814
It's... It's like the roots
of mexico, really, you know.

41:24.816 --> 41:26.149
Everything you see here.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.584
Mezcal, mezcal, mezcal.
