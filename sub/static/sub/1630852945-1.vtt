No, he doesn't know anything

are being stopped and searched."

start to panic.

Then they see there's an exit
a half-mile ahead.

33:34.813 --> 33:36.947
So the cars with drugs
and stuff in them,

33:37.049 --> 33:39.750
they start getting off
at the exit, you know?

Hmm.

41:31.156 --> 41:33.790
No. Probably not.

41:34.326 --> 41:36.893
Well, now I need to.

41:36.995 --> 41:37.727
(franklin grunts)

41:38.897 --> 41:42.232
it's just a friend of mine
I went to high school with,

41:42.334 --> 41:44.968
got into some trouble,
needed a little help.

41:45.070 --> 41:46.970
It's all good.

It's my first stone.

42:06.291 --> 42:07.390
Azurite.

42:07.492 --> 42:09.225
I bought it when I decided
I didn't want

42:09.327 --> 42:12.228
my mom's energy around anymore,

42:12.330 --> 42:14.831
but I didn't quite know
how to tell her.

42:15.467 --> 42:16.966
Why do I feel like you about

42:17.068 --> 42:19.736
to hit me with some bad news?

42:20.272 --> 42:22.305
Mm.

42:22.407 --> 42:24.374
It's not bad.

42:24.476 --> 42:27.143
Listen, I know you didn't bust
your ass,

42:27.245 --> 42:28.978
make it all the way
through law school,

42:29.080 --> 42:31.014
just to be some housewife.

42:31.116 --> 42:32.415
Some things will change.

42:32.517 --> 42:35.919
Everything will change
if we have this baby, franklin.

42:36.021 --> 42:37.387
Yes, I know.

42:37.489 --> 42:40.089
But you can still have
the life that you want.

42:43.094 --> 42:45.895
I believe you.

42:45.997 --> 42:47.063
I do.

42:49.334 --> 42:51.801
I love you, franklin.

42:52.604 --> 42:56.906
Even though having this child
is nowhere in my five year plan.

42:57.008 --> 42:58.007
(laughs)

42:58.109 --> 43:01.678
I know this baby
will be amazing.

43:03.648 --> 43:07.917
That a higher power put this
in our lives for a reason.

43:08.019 --> 43:10.019
But I need you to hear me.

43:10.689 --> 43:13.122
I will not accept a life
that does not support

43:13.224 --> 43:14.457
this child in every way.

43:14.559 --> 43:18.027
-And your other life...
-Is ending.

43:18.129 --> 43:20.897
-Soon.
-(whispers): Okay.

43:21.933 --> 43:23.666
Come here.

43:27.238 --> 43:29.105
90% of how I spend my time now

43:29.207 --> 43:31.507
is being in real estate
with you.

43:31.610 --> 43:35.445
Grady's on our side,
in legit business with us.

43:35.547 --> 43:38.448
He ain't gonna want anything bad
to happen to us.

43:38.550 --> 43:41.951
Hmm. But until then,
you can't control it.

43:44.956 --> 43:46.956
Neither can I.

43:47.058 --> 43:49.192
I have to accept that.

43:49.294 --> 43:51.761
Make my peace with it.

43:54.165 --> 43:55.965
And I have.

44:01.239 --> 44:03.506
I need you to swear to me

44:03.608 --> 44:07.276
that until the day comes
you can walk away,

44:07.379 --> 44:11.914
you will do everything you have
to do to make sure our baby,

44:12.017 --> 44:13.116
this family,

44:13.218 --> 44:15.918
<i> is safe and protected.</i>

44:16.021 --> 44:17.920

44:19.424 --> 44:21.524

44:21.626 --> 44:23.259

out here somewhere.

44:23.361 --> 44:25.728
What it look like?

44:27.232 --> 44:28.431
I think it's, like,
a bright spot

44:28.533 --> 44:31.601
-with a tail behind it.
-A tail?

44:31.703 --> 44:35.038
Think I read it was supposed
to be in the southern sky.

44:38.276 --> 44:40.076
That way.

44:43.314 --> 44:46.049
Oh, wow.

44:46.151 --> 44:48.284
I think I see it.
(laughs)

44:48.386 --> 44:51.320
franklin:
Yeah? Where?

44:51.423 --> 44:55.725
It's right there. See?
Just behind that...
