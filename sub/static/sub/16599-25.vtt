<i>Previously on</i> Hawaii Five-O...
Hey, Moani, if you ever

00:03.737 --> 00:06.739
need anything,
call me anytime.

00:13.613 --> 00:15.113
NURSE:
<i>Can you show me where it hurts?</i>

00:15.148 --> 00:16.748
Here.
- NURSE: <i>And when did the pain start?</i>

00:16.783 --> 00:19.418
She was going too
fast, missed a step.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.453
I need you to notify
Family Services.

00:21.488 --> 00:22.721
I think the girl
in Exam 3

00:22.756 --> 00:24.122
<i>has been abused.</i>

00:24.157 --> 00:25.724
<i>I've seen this</i>
<i>kind of thing before.</i>

00:25.759 --> 00:27.192
This girl has been
sex trafficked

00:27.227 --> 00:28.527
for the past four months.

00:28.562 --> 00:29.728
She's traumatized.

00:29.763 --> 00:31.329
STEVE:
<i>You sure you're okay?</i>

00:31.364 --> 00:33.832
I know it's not a good thing
for a cop to get angry.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.167
You want to sit this one out?

00:35.202 --> 00:36.168
No.

00:36.203 --> 00:37.469
Drop the knife, Emilio.

00:37.504 --> 00:39.304
(both grunting)

00:39.339 --> 00:41.273
Girls as young as seven,

00:41.308 --> 00:42.407
made to service a
dozen guys like you,

00:42.442 --> 00:44.476
every day,
seven days a week.

00:44.511 --> 00:46.478
Do you think those
girls do what they do

00:46.513 --> 00:48.513
out of choice or
out of survival?

00:48.548 --> 00:50.749
Emilio's turned
them into slaves.

00:50.784 --> 00:53.552
They're beaten and brutalized
like slaves; they're branded

00:53.587 --> 00:56.388
<i>like slaves.</i>

01:06.566 --> 01:07.699
(door opens)

01:07.734 --> 01:09.167
DEON:
Let's go, let's go.

01:09.202 --> 01:10.702
Get up!

01:10.737 --> 01:12.171
Come on, get up, move!

01:12.672 --> 01:14.239
Get up! Come on, move!

01:14.274 --> 01:16.541
Outside! Move,
move! Move!

01:16.576 --> 01:17.442
Get up.

01:17.477 --> 01:19.511
Get up. Outside, now!

01:19.546 --> 01:20.812
Forget all that!

01:20.847 --> 01:22.781
Get on outside.

01:22.816 --> 01:23.615
Now! Move!

01:23.650 --> 01:25.350
Don't stop! That's right.

01:25.385 --> 01:26.251
Keep going! Come on!

01:26.286 --> 01:27.219
Come on!

01:27.254 --> 01:29.721
Move, move, move,
let's go!

01:29.756 --> 01:31.456
Inside, let's go.

01:31.491 --> 01:32.691
All the way to the back.

01:32.726 --> 01:34.526
Move, move, move!

01:34.561 --> 01:36.461
Let's go, let's go, let's
go, move, move, move!

01:36.496 --> 01:37.662
Come on.

01:37.697 --> 01:38.730
Inside.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.599
Come on, up, up, up.
Let's go.

02:04.457 --> 02:07.559
<i>(Hawaii Five-O</i>
theme song plays)

02:37.524 --> 02:38.757
This is it.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.692
This is where Daddy works.
What do you think?

02:40.727 --> 02:41.626
Whoa!

02:41.661 --> 02:43.562
Right? Pretty cool, huh?

02:43.597 --> 02:44.529
This, look at this.

02:44.564 --> 02:46.765
This is Auntie Kono's office.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.333
This is Uncle Chin's office.

02:48.368 --> 02:50.435
Papa's office,
right over here.

02:51.438 --> 02:52.837
What about Uncle Steve's?

02:52.872 --> 02:55.307
That's, look, I'll show
you, that's way, way, way

02:55.342 --> 02:57.475
off in the corner over there.
We keep him over there.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.678
It's like he's in exile.
What does that mean?

02:59.713 --> 03:01.413
It means that he's, uh,

03:01.448 --> 03:03.582
you know... you know how
when you do something bad,

03:03.617 --> 03:04.649
you get a time out?

03:04.684 --> 03:06.418
Yeah.
- That's-that's Steve.

03:06.453 --> 03:09.554
He's in a constant
state of time out, Steve.

03:09.589 --> 03:11.356
He's a bad boy.

03:11.391 --> 03:13.225
He's the worst.
The worst.

03:13.260 --> 03:14.926
Couch or floor?
- Floor.

03:14.961 --> 03:16.428
All right, there's your area,
right there.

03:16.463 --> 03:18.463
Go ahead.
Get your guys out.

03:24.004 --> 03:25.537
Hey, Charlie.

03:25.572 --> 03:26.771
Hi, Uncle Steve.

03:26.806 --> 03:28.540
Hey, buddy.

03:28.575 --> 03:30.909
What's going on?
- What, uh,

03:30.944 --> 03:33.445
what are you doing here? You're
supposed to be at the doctor.

03:33.480 --> 03:34.713
Yes, Mother,

03:34.748 --> 03:36.514
I, uh, I went, okay?

03:36.549 --> 03:37.515
How's my liver?

03:37.550 --> 03:39.451
My liver is doing great.
Thanks for asking me.

03:39.486 --> 03:40.719
What's the occasion?

03:40.754 --> 03:42.554
He's here because, uh,

03:42.589 --> 03:44.589
Mom had to go see
the D-I-V-O-R-C-E

03:44.624 --> 03:46.558
lawyer for a couple hours.

03:46.593 --> 03:47.892
STEVE:
Aha.

03:47.927 --> 03:49.427
C-O-P-Y-T-H-A-T.

03:49.462 --> 03:51.496
What are we doing here?
We got army men today?

03:51.531 --> 03:53.698
All right, well, we better...
Danno, I'm hungry.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.700
Hungry?
- Kid's hungry. There's a vending machine

03:55.735 --> 03:57.802
right down the hall.
It is loaded with good things.

03:57.837 --> 04:00.372
Come on, Uncle Steve's
gonna take you. Let's go.

04:00.407 --> 04:03.775
By the way, this, right here,
this is from me to you.

04:03.810 --> 04:05.310
It's a gift.

04:05.345 --> 04:06.778
But don't open it
until I get back.

04:06.813 --> 04:08.513
I'd rather you not, actually.

04:08.548 --> 04:10.882
What, come back?
- Well, that, too,

04:10.917 --> 04:13.885
but no, uh, take him to eat
at a vending machine.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.520
Why not?

04:15.555 --> 04:16.988
Well, 'cause
there's not a lot

04:17.023 --> 04:18.957
of healthy options
at a vending machine, Steve.

04:18.992 --> 04:21.559
Danny, I eat out of that
thing three times a week.

04:21.594 --> 04:22.693
I know,
but you do all kinds

04:22.729 --> 04:25.297
of things that aren't healthy
for your body, but eating

04:25.332 --> 04:26.631
at the vending machine is one of
the things that you...

04:26.666 --> 04:27.999
All right.

04:28.034 --> 04:29.701
Well, we're gonna find
you something nutritious

04:29.736 --> 04:31.436
and healthy
in that vending machine.

04:31.471 --> 04:32.437
All right? What's your
poison, anyway, buddy?

04:32.472 --> 04:35.040
Twinkies, Oreos, Snickers.
You like Snickers?

04:35.075 --> 04:36.741
They got peanuts in 'em. Nuts are healthy.
Why, with the sugar?

04:36.776 --> 04:37.942
Nuts are healthy.
- No,

04:37.977 --> 04:39.311
he doesn't eat sugar.

04:39.346 --> 04:40.545
Okay.

04:40.580 --> 04:41.813
DANNY:
Because of your body?

04:41.848 --> 04:43.715
Charlie, why is your dad such
a poopie-head sometimes, huh?

04:43.750 --> 04:45.617
Don't say poo-- hey!
Charlie,

04:45.652 --> 04:47.619
you see why he gets time outs?
STEVE: You told him about my ti...

04:47.654 --> 04:50.322
He-- what'd he tell you
about my time outs?

04:50.357 --> 04:51.523
Huh? What'd
he tell you?

04:56.563 --> 04:59.331
(both moaning)

04:59.366 --> 05:01.366
(chuckles)

05:06.573 --> 05:08.606
(giggles)

05:08.641 --> 05:10.475
It feels like I haven't
seen you in forever.

05:10.510 --> 05:12.110
Mmm.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.812
You can always
come back to the HPD.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.046
Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

05:15.081 --> 05:16.581
You could always
join Five-O.

05:16.616 --> 05:18.950
Oh?
- (chuckles)

05:25.125 --> 05:27.792
Mmm. What about Sara?

05:27.827 --> 05:30.495
No worries, she won't
be home for a few hours.

05:39.472 --> 05:42.006
(whispers):
In here.

05:42.041 --> 05:43.408
Are you ready?

05:43.443 --> 05:44.909
Uncle Chin
never lets me do this.

05:44.944 --> 05:46.111
'Cause he's a scaredy-cat.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.846
But if you want
to be a surfing champion,

05:47.881 --> 05:49.547
you have to learn
how to be fearless.

05:49.582 --> 05:50.715
Now, hang on.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.584
Let's go!
- Whee!

05:52.619 --> 05:54.486
Whoa!

05:54.521 --> 05:55.553
(both laugh)

05:55.588 --> 05:56.821
That was awesome.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.390
You're awesome.

05:58.425 --> 05:59.324
Okay, so,

05:59.360 --> 06:02.894
what else do I need?
Just napkins and plates.

06:02.929 --> 06:04.763
What about these?

06:04.798 --> 06:06.531
Wow. Good.

06:06.566 --> 06:08.400
Except these say
"Happy Birthday" on it

06:08.435 --> 06:10.502
and this party is
for Uncle Jerry's

06:10.537 --> 06:12.604
getting his badge, so...

06:12.639 --> 06:13.671
What about those ones?

06:13.706 --> 06:14.939
Okay.

06:14.974 --> 06:16.608
Uh-huh.

06:16.643 --> 06:18.576
Tradesies. Napkins.

06:18.611 --> 06:20.479
These are good.
- Beautiful.

06:21.614 --> 06:22.847
Good work.

06:22.882 --> 06:25.850
So, I think we're
almost done.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.852
I just have to get
one more thing.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.087
You want to hang out here?

06:29.122 --> 06:30.522
Okay.
- All right.

06:51.678 --> 06:54.612
Sara, what is this?

06:54.647 --> 06:58.483
(laughs):
What's... this?

06:58.518 --> 07:00.585
You're just like
a little shopping ninja,

07:00.620 --> 07:01.719
aren't you?
(phone rings)

07:01.754 --> 07:05.123
Aah!
- (giggles)

07:05.158 --> 07:05.990
(phone rings)

07:06.026 --> 07:08.660
Hang on, okay?
I'll get back to you.

07:08.695 --> 07:10.195
Hello?

07:11.931 --> 07:13.765
Hey, Moani.

07:16.769 --> 07:18.503
KONO:
<i>That's a cute dress.</i>

07:18.538 --> 07:21.006
My parents bought it last
time they were up here.

07:23.009 --> 07:25.009
So, I heard you're
taking art classes?

07:25.044 --> 07:26.244
How are you enjoying that?

07:26.279 --> 07:28.480
It's okay.
The teacher's nice.

07:30.216 --> 07:33.118
Well, I'd love to see what
you're working on sometime.

07:36.055 --> 07:37.489
Hey, uh,

07:37.524 --> 07:39.524
is everything okay?

07:40.894 --> 07:42.193
Has, um...

07:42.228 --> 07:44.529
has he told you anything?

07:44.564 --> 07:45.930
You mean...

07:45.965 --> 07:47.499
Emilio.

07:49.102 --> 07:51.503
Is that why you called?

07:53.039 --> 07:55.974
You don't have to
worry about that.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.709
He won't talk to you.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.580
Will he?

08:02.916 --> 08:04.649
Uh, on the advice
of his lawyer,

08:04.684 --> 08:06.951
he's refusing to
answer questions.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.953
For now.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.788
He's not gonna
tell you anything.

08:10.823 --> 08:14.659
He's more afraid of the people
he works for than he is of you.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.563
Well, we're pursuing
other leads.

08:18.598 --> 08:20.598
We know others
are involved

08:20.633 --> 08:22.567
and we'll find them.

08:22.602 --> 08:24.903
You have my word on that.

08:37.050 --> 08:39.117
You made this?

08:40.920 --> 08:42.287
Who is he?

08:42.322 --> 08:44.622
Emilio called him Deon.

08:44.657 --> 08:47.526
He had this big truck he used
to use to move us around.

08:49.929 --> 08:51.930
I want to help.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.083
What is it?

09:12.118 --> 09:13.851
Open it.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.219
Not my birthday.

09:15.254 --> 09:16.921
So what?

09:16.956 --> 09:19.023
Doesn't have to be a special
occasion; I got you a gift.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.159
You want to make a big deal
about it; just open it.

09:21.194 --> 09:22.660
Mother's Day?

09:22.695 --> 09:24.596
What?
- Mother's Day.

09:24.631 --> 09:25.697
It's, uh, Mother's Day
in a week,

09:25.732 --> 09:26.798
and I'm very overprotective.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.833
You're doing a thing,
you're making a joke, 'cause...

09:28.868 --> 09:29.968
No?
- Oy.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.235
You're crazy.

09:31.270 --> 09:32.937
You know that?
You're a crazy person.

09:32.972 --> 09:35.640
Well, I'm not crazy,
I'm just not interested in,

09:35.675 --> 09:37.375
like, a, like, a goof,
like, a gag gift.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.644
(scoffs) I don't know
why I try to be nice.

09:39.679 --> 09:41.079
I just wanted to get you
something. Forget about it.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.080
All right?
- No, whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.915
Hey, hey...
- Hey, you can't take back a gift.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.183
(chuckles):
Well, open it.

09:45.218 --> 09:46.818
You know,
this gesture of generosity

09:46.853 --> 09:49.020
is very uncharacteristic of you.
- I got it.

09:49.055 --> 09:50.755
Why don't I just take it
and smash it over your head?

09:50.790 --> 09:52.790
Well, I'll open it,
in that case.

09:52.825 --> 09:54.359
(knock) - I don't
want it to be...

09:57.130 --> 09:59.097
I'll wait.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.999
Got a hit on Moani's sketch.
Meet Deon Miller.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.835
He got popped for assault
two years ago, but the charges

10:03.870 --> 10:04.869
were dropped.

10:04.904 --> 10:05.970
DMV confirms
this guy's got a Class A

10:06.005 --> 10:07.639
commercial
driver's license.

10:07.674 --> 10:08.973
Owns a private
independent trucking company.

10:09.008 --> 10:10.341
And we know what
he's hauling.

10:10.376 --> 10:12.076
DANNY: All right, we got
a last known on him?

10:12.111 --> 10:13.211
KONO: Yeah,
he's got a place

10:13.246 --> 10:14.812
out in Kaneohe.

10:14.847 --> 10:15.579
One road takes
you in and out.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.115
STEVE: All right,
we got to assume

10:17.150 --> 10:18.416
he's holding girls
in that house.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.884
This has got
to be surgical.

10:19.919 --> 10:20.952
Kono, reach out to HPD.

10:20.987 --> 10:22.387
Tell 'em to lock
that perimeter down.

10:22.422 --> 10:23.721
Got it.

10:23.756 --> 10:26.124
(computer beeping)

10:52.452 --> 10:53.985
GROVER:
Clear.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.014
♪ ♪

11:37.130 --> 11:39.130
(coffeemaker beeps)

11:46.038 --> 11:47.238
Looks like they left in a hurry.

11:47.273 --> 11:48.339
Yeah.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.909
But how'd they even
know we were coming?

12:06.325 --> 12:09.094
(sighs)
I know how you feel.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.796
I can't stop

12:11.831 --> 12:13.832
thinking about
that place either.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.870
I could feel them
in that room.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.906
Their pain and trauma.

12:23.342 --> 12:26.044
The fear they went
to bed with every night.

12:29.215 --> 12:31.182
I've been angry
ever since I met Moani.

12:31.217 --> 12:33.951
I don't know
what to do about it.

12:33.986 --> 12:35.953
Well, if it helps,

12:35.988 --> 12:38.156
I think you're right
where you need to be.

12:42.995 --> 12:45.429
I can't even imagine
being a parent.

12:45.464 --> 12:47.064
(scoffs)

12:47.099 --> 12:49.467
Let me tell you something,
Kono, I've been trying to...

12:49.502 --> 12:52.303
separate that from
the job for years.

12:53.439 --> 12:56.808
I can't do it.

12:56.843 --> 13:00.144
The timing of
this is so...

13:00.179 --> 13:01.913
It's almost creepy.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.915
Samantha just got accepted
into Northwestern

13:03.950 --> 13:05.416
a few weeks ago.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.918
Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.187
That's great.
- Yeah.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.024
But the thought of sending her
there by herself,

13:13.059 --> 13:17.895
to Chicago, where every cop
in the city hates me

13:17.930 --> 13:20.097
because they think I turned
on one of their own...

13:20.132 --> 13:24.335
And on top of that, you got
monsters like this in the world?

13:24.370 --> 13:27.538
I can't let her go. I mean...

13:27.573 --> 13:30.341
How can I let her go?

13:31.344 --> 13:33.011
(sighs)

13:35.081 --> 13:37.415

13:37.450 --> 13:39.283

13:39.318 --> 13:41.285
Hey, Jerry,
what do you got?

13:41.320 --> 13:43.955
Just got a hit on Deon's truck.
It was spotted on the H-1.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.156
Call Duke.

13:45.191 --> 13:46.390
Have him get a helo
up in the air.

13:46.425 --> 13:47.592
I want a thermal
confirmation

13:47.627 --> 13:49.060
and Duke's boys ready
for a roadblock.

13:49.095 --> 13:50.562
Copy that.
Yeah.

14:04.410 --> 14:08.179
2990 to Commander McGarrett,
we got a visual on the target.

14:08.214 --> 14:11.148
Thermals indicate
one in the cab.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.084
11 in the bed.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.156
If this guy's talking
to somebody,

14:19.191 --> 14:21.025
I want to know who it is.

14:38.110 --> 14:39.143
STEVE:

but nobody approaches.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.382
I repeat: nobody approaches.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.150
Got it.

14:46.185 --> 14:47.418
All right, let's go!

14:47.453 --> 14:49.353
You heard Commander McGarrett.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.055

Go, let's go.

14:51.090 --> 14:53.391

Ground has visual.

15:04.303 --> 15:06.003
STEVE:
Copy that.

15:06.038 --> 15:08.172

the perimeter locked down,

15:08.207 --> 15:09.373
everybody on hot standby

15:09.408 --> 15:10.541

Everybody, move, move, move!

15:30.730 --> 15:32.063
Abby, get out of there now!

15:45.311 --> 15:47.278
We hold fire! Hold fire!

15:47.313 --> 15:48.713
There's hostages in there.

16:04.563 --> 16:07.365

16:14.573 --> 16:16.007
Abby.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.745
You okay?

16:20.780 --> 16:23.481
A little banged up,
but I'm good.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.484
Look, I don't suppose
I could convince you

16:26.519 --> 16:28.586
to go to a hospital,
get checked out?

16:28.621 --> 16:30.488
I'd be happy to.

16:32.091 --> 16:33.324
As soon as we get this guy.

16:34.560 --> 16:35.559
We done?

16:35.594 --> 16:37.695
Yeah.
- Thank you.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.364
(sighs)
All right.

16:40.399 --> 16:42.066
Your car or mine?

16:42.101 --> 16:43.534
Maybe mine.
- (chuckles)

16:45.604 --> 16:47.638

16:47.673 --> 16:49.640
DANNY:<i> I don't get it.</i>
<i>We're on an island.</i>

16:49.675 --> 16:51.509
Where's he gonna go?
STEVE: Maybe he thinks

16:51.544 --> 16:53.377
we're gonna get bored
or back off or something.

16:53.412 --> 16:54.512
That was... that was
a legitimate question.

16:54.547 --> 16:55.713
You don't have to be
a smart-ass with me.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.782
Okay. All right.
You know what, buddy?

16:57.817 --> 16:59.550
I know you're stressed
about Rachel's divorce,

16:59.585 --> 17:01.452
but you need to tone
it down a notch, okay?

17:01.487 --> 17:02.453
Why would you even
bring Rachel...?

17:02.488 --> 17:03.587
It's got nothing--
you were being sarcastic.

17:03.622 --> 17:05.056
No, I wasn't.

17:05.091 --> 17:06.590
I was not being sarcastic.
- Oh, no?

17:06.625 --> 17:09.093
No, and if we're being honest
right now, I don't think

17:09.128 --> 17:11.462
this thing with you and Rachel
is, uh, is a healthy thing.

17:11.497 --> 17:12.797
I'm helping her out with the
kids sometimes. - Yeah.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.832
After work at night. After work? I
help-- I put Charlie down to bed

17:14.867 --> 17:16.300
sometimes at her place. And then what?
Then what do you do?

17:16.335 --> 17:19.403
DANNY: <i>What do you mean, "And then
what?" What do I do? We talk.</i>

17:19.438 --> 17:20.438
What do you mean?
- Talk?

17:20.473 --> 17:22.106
Yeah, we talk.
- With your ex-wife?

17:22.141 --> 17:24.642
(laughs) - Why is that funny?
Why is that funny?

17:24.677 --> 17:25.776
Oh, I don't know, Danny.

17:25.812 --> 17:27.178
Maybe 'cause you're like a
ten-year-old with a crush.

17:27.213 --> 17:30.614
Oh, you know what? You're out of your mind.
I know I'm out of my mind,

17:30.649 --> 17:32.583
but I also know that you're
in love with your ex-wife.

17:32.618 --> 17:33.817
Oh, please.
- And you won't admit it.

17:33.853 --> 17:36.253
Stop it. And this whole divorce
thing that she's going through

17:36.288 --> 17:38.122
is something you're happy
about because it's finally--

17:38.157 --> 17:39.790
you got a shot to make
things right, okay?

17:39.825 --> 17:41.559
All you got to do is admit it.
(phone rings)

17:41.594 --> 17:43.427
By the way, I get it.
Hold on. Jerry.

17:43.462 --> 17:45.162
Hey, Jerry, you got
that number for me?

17:45.197 --> 17:46.697
Sending it over now.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.166

17:53.139 --> 17:55.673
(phone rings)

17:59.578 --> 18:01.345
(phone beeps)

18:01.380 --> 18:03.481
STEVE:
Deon Miller,

18:03.516 --> 18:05.783
this is Commander McGarrett
with Five-O.

18:05.818 --> 18:08.786
I need you to pull
that truck over, sir.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.657
Come on, Deon. Look...

18:13.692 --> 18:16.393
we know that you
handle logistics

18:16.428 --> 18:17.427
for Emilio and
his people.

18:17.463 --> 18:20.698
You are currently illegally
transporting minors.

18:20.733 --> 18:23.234
If you refuse
to cooperate,

18:23.269 --> 18:24.835
we are gonna charge you with
multiple counts of kidnapping,

18:24.870 --> 18:26.804
and I will personally throw
your ass in a prison cell

18:26.839 --> 18:28.672
where you stay for
the rest of your life.

18:28.707 --> 18:29.473
You understand?

18:29.508 --> 18:31.475
Try to stop me,

18:31.510 --> 18:34.378
and I will drive this truck
off a cliff.

18:34.413 --> 18:35.846
(call ends)

18:35.881 --> 18:38.149
Little aggressive with him,
I think. My personal opinion.

18:38.184 --> 18:40.251
I'm aggre... Did you hear
what he just said to me?

18:40.286 --> 18:41.485
He was reacting
to your threat.

18:41.520 --> 18:42.753
That's why he said what he said.
- Oh.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.622
Oh, now you're the perp whisperer.
Good. People don't like

18:44.657 --> 18:45.823
to be threatened.
Nobody likes to be threatened.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.892
You've heard the expression,
"Y-You get more flies with honey

18:47.927 --> 18:49.527
than with vinegar"?
No, I haven't. No.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.162
But I have heard, "If
you ain't got nothing

18:51.197 --> 18:54.198
nice and positive to say,
keep your hole shut."

18:54.233 --> 18:55.566
Unless you're "talking"
to your ex-wife.

18:55.601 --> 18:57.501
Oh, would you please
just stop with that?

18:57.536 --> 18:58.669
Enough.
- Yeah, I will, I will.

18:58.704 --> 19:01.572
When you admit what we both
know to be true, I will stop

19:01.607 --> 19:02.540
with that stuff.
(phone rings)

19:02.575 --> 19:03.908
Jerry, what do you got?

19:03.943 --> 19:05.776
A whole bunch of information
you're not gonna like.

19:05.811 --> 19:07.411
STEVE:
Can't wait. Give it to me.

19:07.446 --> 19:10.781
Okay, so Deon's semi
holds 300 gallons of fuel

19:10.816 --> 19:12.550
and gets five miles
to the gallon,

19:12.585 --> 19:15.486
which means that if he's driving
on a full tank, he could,

19:15.521 --> 19:17.788
in theory, circumnavigate
the island for days.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.190
DANNY:
So wait until he runs

19:19.225 --> 19:20.257
out of gas is not an option.

19:20.292 --> 19:21.659
Diesel, but yeah.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.527
DANNY: All right,
so why don't we have HPD

19:23.562 --> 19:24.695
set up a bunch of spike strips

19:24.730 --> 19:26.497
and we'll stop the guy? - Good.

19:26.532 --> 19:27.565
JERRY:<i> Yeah,</i>
<i>that's not gonna work, either.</i>

19:27.600 --> 19:28.432
STEVE:
<i>Why not?</i>

19:28.468 --> 19:30.434
In other police chases
involving semis,

19:30.469 --> 19:31.969
it took a minimum
of three spike strips

19:32.004 --> 19:33.337
to neutralize the truck.

19:33.372 --> 19:35.272
The danger of using that many

19:35.307 --> 19:38.409
is that Deon could very easily
lose control of the semi

19:38.444 --> 19:40.277
and it could crash or turn over,

19:40.312 --> 19:41.746
jeopardizing the lives
of everybody in that trailer.

19:45.251 --> 19:47.585
Wait a minute.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.586
All right.

19:48.621 --> 19:51.255
New plan: everybody back
to the Palace right now.

19:51.290 --> 19:52.557
I got an idea.
(siren chirps)

19:59.431 --> 20:01.465
(engine revs)

20:01.500 --> 20:03.500
GROVER:
<i>Okay.</i>

20:03.535 --> 20:05.369
I'm-I'm confused.

20:05.404 --> 20:07.771
You're gonna jump
onto a truck that's moving--

20:07.806 --> 20:09.607
moving at least
30 miles an hour--

20:09.642 --> 20:11.308
and somehow,
you're gonna

20:11.343 --> 20:13.477
get into the truck and rescue

20:13.512 --> 20:15.579
a dozen or so hostages,
and the driver,

20:15.614 --> 20:18.682
who is our suspect,
is gonna be none the wiser.

20:18.717 --> 20:19.650
That's your plan?

20:19.685 --> 20:21.719
Correct.

20:23.622 --> 20:25.322
How exactly does that happen?

20:25.357 --> 20:26.890
I just explained it to you guys.
DANNY: Pretty sure

20:26.925 --> 20:28.892
none of us understood it.
Doesn't make sense.

20:28.927 --> 20:31.629
Hold on.

20:31.664 --> 20:34.431
(slaps table)
Where is he going?

20:34.466 --> 20:35.532
He's gonna go get a better plan.

20:35.567 --> 20:36.834
I hope.

20:38.837 --> 20:40.271
(zipper opens)

20:43.609 --> 20:46.344
Those are Charlie's, not mine.

20:47.713 --> 20:48.746
(Steve clears throat)

20:54.620 --> 20:57.622
Here's the bad guy
and the truck, all right?

20:58.757 --> 21:01.625
This is HPD.

21:01.660 --> 21:02.960
Five-O. Got it?

21:04.430 --> 21:05.496
We are gonna call ahead,

21:05.531 --> 21:07.031
call HPD,

21:07.066 --> 21:09.500
have them help us
block this guy in.

21:09.535 --> 21:10.567
Once we got him
blocked in,

21:10.602 --> 21:12.403
we can force him
into the H-3 tunnel.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.708
When it comes out, I'm waiting
for him on the other side.

21:17.743 --> 21:18.843
I jump down.

21:19.678 --> 21:21.011
I land on the back of his rig.

21:21.046 --> 21:22.813
I make my way inside.

21:22.848 --> 21:24.948
He doesn't know about it.

21:24.983 --> 21:27.518
So, basically like Stiles
in the original<i> Teen Wolf,</i>

21:27.553 --> 21:28.686
only ten times as crazy.

21:28.721 --> 21:31.588
DANNY: Okay, just
so I understand,

21:31.623 --> 21:32.589
you're the Army guy here.

21:32.624 --> 21:33.691
I'm the Navy guy, but go ahead.

21:33.726 --> 21:34.858
You're gonna land

21:34.893 --> 21:37.628
with perfect timing
as this truck--

21:37.663 --> 21:39.663
speeding,
coming out of the tunnel--

21:39.698 --> 21:40.530
you're gonna land
with precision,

21:40.566 --> 21:41.999
with your feet on the...
on the truck?

21:42.034 --> 21:43.634
Not actually gonna
be that hard to time.

21:43.669 --> 21:46.503
We got everything we need.
We got speed, we got distance.

21:46.538 --> 21:49.006
We will have rate
of acceleration, right, Jerry?

21:49.041 --> 21:52.343
Okay, there's got
to be a better way.

21:52.378 --> 21:53.677
Well, I am open

21:53.712 --> 21:55.346
to suggestions.

21:57.383 --> 21:58.649
Okay.

21:58.684 --> 22:00.684
All right. Well, clearly,
we're out of options.

22:00.719 --> 22:02.353
We're also out of time.
This guy's very dangerous,

22:02.388 --> 22:03.587
and he's got a truck
full of kids.

22:03.622 --> 22:04.521
My concern is:

22:04.557 --> 22:07.391
if he learns he's gonna lose
in the end,

22:07.426 --> 22:08.625
he could do something
at any stage

22:08.660 --> 22:10.561
that will hurt
those girls.

22:10.596 --> 22:12.563

DANNY: Look, let's say

22:12.598 --> 22:14.131
that this works,
this ridiculous plan works,

22:14.166 --> 22:15.499
which I don't think
it's going to.

22:15.534 --> 22:16.667

in the back

22:16.702 --> 22:17.601

then what?

22:17.636 --> 22:19.403
That's where you guys come in.

22:29.114 --> 22:30.714
Excuse me. I'm just curious.

22:30.749 --> 22:32.449
Are you completely
whacked out of your head?

22:32.484 --> 22:34.118
What's the matter
with you?

22:34.153 --> 22:35.953
(pills rattle)
Are you, uh...

22:35.988 --> 22:38.021
You got a better idea?
I don't have a better...

22:38.056 --> 22:38.888
What, are you
still taking pills?

22:38.924 --> 22:40.391
I thought you were done
with the pills.

22:40.426 --> 22:41.925
Huh?
With the, you broke my liver

22:41.960 --> 22:44.094
and the doc put you back on them or what?
First of all,

22:44.129 --> 22:45.796
Danny, you can't break a liver.
And second of all,

22:45.831 --> 22:47.097
don't you have something else to do?
- I...

22:47.132 --> 22:48.932
actually, I do.
I-It's watch you commit suicide,

22:48.967 --> 22:50.167
but I'm trying to put that off

22:50.202 --> 22:52.169
as much as possible,
you know what I mean?

22:52.204 --> 22:54.104
I'll give it
some time, huh?

22:54.139 --> 22:57.708
We don't have time, brother.
We got to go. Come on.

get this guy onto H-3.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.102
The on-ramp is coming up.
We got one shot.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.233
It worked. Everyone, be advised:

23:56.268 --> 23:58.068
the target is now on the H-3

23:58.103 --> 24:01.038

for the Tetsuo Harano Tunnels.

24:01.073 --> 24:02.173
STEVE:
All right, good work, guys.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.714
Okay. Listen up, Jerry.

24:10.749 --> 24:12.249
Soon as he comes out
of that tunnel,

24:12.284 --> 24:13.851
jam his cell signal, all right?

24:13.886 --> 24:14.985
If he's live streaming news,

24:15.020 --> 24:16.219
I don't want him
seeing any of this.

24:16.255 --> 24:18.655
JERRY: Copy that. Air support
is moving into position now.

24:18.690 --> 24:20.057

have something to say.

24:20.092 --> 24:21.225
Again?

24:21.260 --> 24:22.359
Yes, again, okay?

24:22.395 --> 24:24.595
Nobody ever listens to me.
If you want to die today,

24:24.630 --> 24:26.063
that's what you want to do,
I'm fine with it.

24:26.098 --> 24:29.132
(grunts)
Can't you just say "good luck"?

24:29.167 --> 24:30.868
No, I can't say "good luck,"
because the only way

24:30.903 --> 24:32.169
that luck plays a part
in any of this

24:32.204 --> 24:34.037
is if you end up paralyzed
instead of dead.

24:34.072 --> 24:36.640

37:03.421 --> 37:04.954
He had contacts
all over the country.

37:04.989 --> 37:08.491
ABBY: Carson City, Flagstaff,
Phoenix, El Paso,

37:08.526 --> 37:11.027
San Antonio, New Orleans,
all over the place.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.695
Well, this is no small operation.
STEVE: No, it's not.

37:12.730 --> 37:13.863
The web is huge.

37:13.898 --> 37:16.299
Hawaii was one tentacle,
and guys like Deon

37:16.334 --> 37:18.301
and Emilio,
they're everywhere.

37:18.336 --> 37:20.270
So what happens now?
STEVE: Well, I reach out

37:20.305 --> 37:21.871
to law enforcement
in each of these cities.

37:21.906 --> 37:23.806
I pass on whatever intel
we have,

37:23.841 --> 37:26.243
and we hope that they follow-up
and shut down these hubs.

37:27.445 --> 37:28.945
Is that even gonna make a dent?

37:32.784 --> 37:35.351
I mean, it's not like these
girls are kept in one place.

37:35.386 --> 37:37.420
In every single one of those
cities, there's at least

37:37.455 --> 37:40.423
a dozen houses like the ones
we raided this morning.

37:40.458 --> 37:41.491
Those girls are moved around
constantly.

37:41.526 --> 37:43.693
Do any one of those departments
have the resources

37:43.728 --> 37:45.562
or the will to deal with this?

37:47.765 --> 37:51.701
Kono, look, I mean, we all agree
there's more to do.

37:51.736 --> 37:53.403
There's a lot more to do.

37:54.639 --> 37:55.838
But today, ten more girls

37:55.873 --> 37:57.540
went back to their parents.

38:04.882 --> 38:07.617
Look, we did the best
that we could do.

Keep bouncing, buddy.
You'll be all right.

Yo.
(knocks)

39:58.596 --> 39:59.729
I'm sorry, Charlie boy.

39:59.764 --> 40:00.997
Come on in.

40:01.032 --> 40:02.532
Hey, don't, uh,
don't touch anything.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.100
And flush the toilet,
wash your hands afterwards.

40:04.135 --> 40:06.702
Right, he knows what to do.

40:06.737 --> 40:08.104
What's the matter?
You all right?

40:08.139 --> 40:09.639
Nice hat.

40:09.674 --> 40:11.641
Thanks.

40:11.676 --> 40:12.642
Yeah, I'm, uh...

40:14.078 --> 40:15.578
What?

40:15.613 --> 40:16.712
I've been getting
these spells.

40:16.747 --> 40:17.780
What spells?

40:17.815 --> 40:19.715
Look, I lied to you about
going to the doctor, okay?

40:19.750 --> 40:22.118
I didn't go to the doctor
about my liver.

40:22.153 --> 40:23.820
I just haven't been
feeling so great, so,

40:23.855 --> 40:26.923
they ran some tests
last week.

40:26.958 --> 40:28.925
And?
- And I got a little

40:28.960 --> 40:30.493
radiation poisoning
from that dirty bomb

40:30.528 --> 40:31.928
that we diffused
a couple months ago.

40:31.963 --> 40:34.197
It's fine.

40:34.232 --> 40:36.199
The pills you've seen me taking,
that's a short term thing.

40:36.234 --> 40:37.066
It's gonna knock it out.
All right.

40:37.102 --> 40:39.135
Short term, so, what,
uh, long term,

40:39.170 --> 40:41.204
is there any-- what--
I mean, what is it?

40:41.239 --> 40:43.105
Come on, Danny.
You ask ten of these guys,

40:43.140 --> 40:44.373
you're gonna get ten
different opinions, right?

40:44.408 --> 40:47.143
Right. Well, what did this, what
did this guy-- he say anything

40:47.178 --> 40:49.645
about long term, or... ?

40:49.680 --> 40:52.815
He-he says he's almost 100% sure

40:52.850 --> 40:56.018
I'm gonna get some
side effects down the road.

40:56.053 --> 40:58.221
Danny, we're talking years
down the road, not today.

40:58.256 --> 41:00.523
I'm fine right now.
This is nothing.

41:00.558 --> 41:02.558
Will you make me a drink,
please?

41:02.593 --> 41:03.860
Come on, we got a lot
to celebrate, right?

41:03.895 --> 41:06.095
I love you.
Make me a drink.

41:22.046 --> 41:23.646

Yeah. Hey, Kono, it's me.

41:23.681 --> 41:25.648
Uh, we're all over here
at Jerry's party

41:25.683 --> 41:27.583
and thought you might
be here, too.

41:27.618 --> 41:30.286
Uh, just calling to make sure
everything's okay.

41:30.321 --> 41:32.154
Get back to me when you can,
all right?

41:32.189 --> 41:33.956
Bye.

41:45.303 --> 41:47.570
Once we reach
our cruising altitude,

41:47.605 --> 41:49.238
I will be turning off
the seatbelt sign.

41:49.273 --> 41:51.307

to move around the cabin...
