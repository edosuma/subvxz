00:12.200 --> 00:13.992
"Previously on" 24.

00:14.089 --> 00:15.977
How much of the virus was released?

00:16.104 --> 00:18.473
Enough to kill everyone in the building.

00:18.568 --> 00:21.866
- "Did you plant any other vials?"
- My assignment was the hotel.

00:21.961 --> 00:25.802
- So there are others?
- Yes. Eleven.

00:25.930 --> 00:29.033
Alvers planted a vial containing
the Cordilla virus in the ventilation system.

00:29.129 --> 00:30.921
It went off as Gael
was trying to disarm it.

00:31.018 --> 00:34.283
No one can be allowed to leave the building.
We have to impose a total quarantine.

00:34.378 --> 00:37.644
If these people realize what's going on,
there'll be widespread panic.

00:37.739 --> 00:39.722
They're lying to us.
It's inside the building!

00:39.851 --> 00:41.931
- " Keep away from the door!"
- "Stay back. Back!"

00:43.788 --> 00:47.469
- "If you try to leave, I will shoot you."
- No, you won't.

00:50.572 --> 00:54.798
- He knows who you are, Jack.
- "Who knows who I am?"

00:54.893 --> 00:58.255
"Don't presume to tell me
about Jack Bauer." That's what he said.

00:58.382 --> 01:00.301
You go up against him,
you're a dead man.

01:00.429 --> 01:02.638
This is Bauer.

01:02.733 --> 01:07.918
Hello, Jack. I knew you were better than
Amador, but you're not better than me.

01:08.015 --> 01:11.854
I need you to put me in touch
with a... friend of yours.

01:11.983 --> 01:15.632
Mr. President, the man in possession of the
Cordilla virus has demanded to speak with you.

01:15.727 --> 01:20.271
You are no longer
in control of your country.

01:20.368 --> 01:25.553
And if you do not use the full power
of your office to execute my wishes...

01:25.649 --> 01:28.081
the virus will be released...

01:28.210 --> 01:31.025
and it will be impossible to stop.

01:31.793 --> 01:36.049
The following takes place
between 5:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.

01:38.162 --> 01:41.394
Everybody stay calm.

01:41.490 --> 01:43.314
Stay calm and quiet.

01:43.411 --> 01:47.251
Look, outside.

01:47.380 --> 01:50.996
Move in! Move in! Copy that position.

01:51.091 --> 01:52.756
No!

01:55.092 --> 02:00.310
I wanna make one thing clear right now!

02:00.437 --> 02:04.052
No one leaves this building
until further notice.

02:06.357 --> 02:11.413
In a moment, I will get on
the intercom and explain why.

02:11.509 --> 02:16.246
I need absolute quiet
and absolute cooperation.

02:20.952 --> 02:22.999
- " Stay back."
- Reaches the entire hotel?

02:23.095 --> 02:26.392
Yes.

02:28.248 --> 02:30.809
This is Federal Agent Michelle Dessler.

02:30.905 --> 02:34.072
In order to survive what's happened...

02:34.168 --> 02:39.386
you will need to listen carefully
and follow my instructions.

02:39.513 --> 02:41.977
As most of you already know,
an infectious substance...

02:42.105 --> 02:45.466
has been released in the building,
and the hotel has been quarantined.

02:45.593 --> 02:48.282
Anyone attempting to leave...

02:48.379 --> 02:51.675
will be stopped
by any means necessary.

02:51.803 --> 02:54.747
If you are in your room, stay there.

02:54.875 --> 02:59.484
If you are anywhere else,
return to your room immediately.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.853
Medical assistance will arrive shortly...

03:01.949 --> 03:03.835
and be given to anyone who requires it.

03:03.964 --> 03:08.412
The first priority is to go back
to your room and stay there.

03:10.396 --> 03:13.788
- Thank you.
- Okay, folks, you heard the announcement.

03:13.917 --> 03:17.181
Let's make our way back to the elevators.
The elevators are back in operation.

03:17.278 --> 03:19.486
This way, people,
in an orderly fashion.

03:22.303 --> 03:25.150
Oh, God. Danny?

03:25.246 --> 03:28.736
Dan... Oh, no.

03:28.831 --> 03:31.584
- Oh, my God.
- Okay. We're going.

03:35.039 --> 03:38.656
Who did this?
Who killed him?

03:40.608 --> 03:44.992
You? You're a federal agent.

03:45.121 --> 03:48.065
You were supposed to protect him.

03:48.193 --> 03:51.810
- Get your hands off me!
- " I am sorry."

03:51.906 --> 03:53.730
But this is just gonna
make things worse.

03:53.826 --> 03:56.515
- You were supposed to protect him.
- "It's okay."

03:56.610 --> 03:59.459
If you require immediate medical attention...

03:59.554 --> 04:01.187
please step aside over here.

04:01.316 --> 04:03.492
Yeah. This is Bauer.

04:03.588 --> 04:06.819
Agent Bauer,
please hold for the president.

04:06.915 --> 04:08.516
- Jack.
- Mr. President.

04:08.611 --> 04:11.236
The man I spoke to,
the one who controls this virus...

04:11.331 --> 04:13.156
why did he use you to get to me?

04:13.252 --> 04:16.036
I wish I could answer that,
sir. He says he knows me...

04:16.130 --> 04:18.692
but right now we haven't been able to
ascertain a positive identification.

04:18.788 --> 04:22.917
The only thing I can tell you for certain
is within the last hour, he was in L.A.

04:23.014 --> 04:25.862
Jack, he made it clear that he intends
to use the threat...

04:25.957 --> 04:28.006
of releasing this virus
to control me, and through me...

04:28.101 --> 04:29.830
the entire apparatus of
our national government.

04:29.926 --> 04:32.839
- Obviously, we cannot let that happen.
- I understand, sir.

04:32.967 --> 04:35.846
- Find him, Jack.
- We're doing everything we can.

04:35.974 --> 04:37.350
- I'll keep in touch.
- Thank you.

04:37.446 --> 04:40.743
With Amador dead,
we got two leads left.

04:40.871 --> 04:44.040
First, whoever this guy is
says he knows me.

04:44.135 --> 04:47.143
Second, he knows Alvers.

04:47.240 --> 04:50.024
- The guy who planted the virus at the hotel?
- That's right.

04:50.120 --> 04:53.065
I want you to call Tony. Tell him to get
Alvers to give us a physical description.

04:53.193 --> 04:57.417
As detailed as possible. Then I wanna cross-check
with the personnel in my service file.

04:59.113 --> 05:01.898
Bauer says he doesn't know
who this man is.

05:01.994 --> 05:04.074
- But he knows Bauer?
- Apparently.

05:04.171 --> 05:07.050
- David, how is that possible?
- I don't know, Wayne.

05:07.177 --> 05:09.226
All I know is they're doing everything
they can to find this man.

05:09.322 --> 05:11.659
Did he give Bauer any
indication of what he wants?

05:11.754 --> 05:16.491
No. But he controls enough of the virus
to wipe out a significant portion...

05:16.619 --> 05:18.923
of this country's population.

05:19.020 --> 05:22.956
So whatever he wants, we don't have
much choice but to give it to him.

05:23.053 --> 05:25.709
At least for now.

05:25.805 --> 05:28.333
Make sure all the exits are sealed off.

05:28.429 --> 05:31.630
- I just checked a few minutes ago.
- Well, check again.

05:31.725 --> 05:37.167
You don't have to keep me busy,
Agent Dessler. I'm not gonna panic.

05:37.260 --> 05:39.949
I know you won't.

05:40.045 --> 05:43.215
I appreciate all
the help you've given me.

05:43.310 --> 05:47.631
I'd just like to know the truth.
Um, is everyone in this hotel gonna die?

05:50.415 --> 05:53.712
Not everyone. A few
will be immune to the virus.

05:53.839 --> 05:56.144
But most of us...

05:58.064 --> 06:01.681
- What are the chances of survival?
- I don't know.

06:01.777 --> 06:04.626
I'll let you know as soon as I do.

06:04.754 --> 06:06.962
Thank you.

06:07.058 --> 06:10.993
Dessler.

06:11.089 --> 06:13.938
Hey, it's me. The perimeter's set.

06:14.033 --> 06:16.882
Good. Things are under control right now,
but a panic's still possible...

06:16.979 --> 06:19.570
- as more people start showing symptoms.
- We have to be ready for that...

06:19.666 --> 06:22.931
especially since the incubation period of
the virus is so much shorter than we thought.

06:23.027 --> 06:26.035
How're you doing?

06:26.132 --> 06:29.043
I'm fine... so far.

06:29.172 --> 06:31.668
- I just...
- What?

06:32.884 --> 06:36.598
Things got crazy.
I had to shoot a man.

06:36.693 --> 06:40.660
He was trying to
get out of the hotel.

06:40.757 --> 06:42.485
He's dead.

06:42.581 --> 06:44.726
Michelle, you did what you had to do.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.414
The only thing you could've done.

06:47.510 --> 06:50.197
- You need to stay focused, all right?
- I know. I am.

06:50.294 --> 06:52.983
All right. There's something we need
you to do. We need you to find out...

06:53.078 --> 06:55.447
if Alvers ever saw the man that hired him.

06:55.543 --> 06:58.231
We need a description
as detailed as possible.

06:58.328 --> 07:00.215
I'm on it. I'll call you right back.

07:12.184 --> 07:15.161
Medical assistance just got here.
We're gonna really need your help now.

07:15.289 --> 07:18.938
- "Please, step forward."
- " Break up in four teams, save time."

07:20.825 --> 07:22.714
Come on, everybody. Move it.

07:23.930 --> 07:26.778
All right. Ma'am, bring her up.

07:38.877 --> 07:42.652
- I'm bleeding.
- You don't look too bad so far.

07:42.748 --> 07:46.972
We had a deal. I told you what I knew,
you'd kill me when I start showing symptoms.

07:47.069 --> 07:49.373
You haven't told us
everything you know.

07:49.469 --> 07:53.245
- What are you talking about?
- The man you work for.

07:53.373 --> 07:56.414
- What's his name?
- He never told me his name.

07:58.879 --> 08:03.006
I'm dying. I have nothing to gain
by lying about it.

08:05.759 --> 08:08.128
When was the last time you saw him?

08:08.256 --> 08:11.617
Three hours ago
at a go parlor in Chinatown.

08:13.983 --> 08:18.497
- Tony, I'm with Alvers.
- We're ready. Go ahead.

08:18.592 --> 08:23.425
- I want a description.
- Mid-30s, Caucasian.

08:23.552 --> 08:27.618
Uh, about 6'1 ",
black hair, brown eyes.

08:27.714 --> 08:30.018
Lean. No facial hair.

08:30.115 --> 08:32.227
He-He speaks with a British accent.

08:32.322 --> 08:34.691
- Got that?
- Yeah, we got it.

08:34.785 --> 08:37.443
- How long's this gonna take?
- Once the parameters are in, not long.

08:37.539 --> 08:40.836
I just need to cross-reference it with personnel
that Jack has worked with in the past.

08:47.044 --> 08:49.732
All right, Jack. We're uploading
photos of possible suspects.

08:49.828 --> 08:52.805
- "You should have a visual."
- " Copy that."

08:56.741 --> 09:00.325
No. No. No.

09:00.422 --> 09:03.814
No. No.

09:03.941 --> 09:07.590
No. No.

09:10.151 --> 09:14.502
No. No. No.

09:16.199 --> 09:19.048
No. No.

09:20.840 --> 09:23.592
- He's not there.
- Are you sure?

09:23.688 --> 09:25.544
- Of course I'm sure.
- Tony.

09:25.640 --> 09:28.872
Yeah, I heard. We're gonna have to widen
the search parameters.

09:28.969 --> 09:32.266
The accent might be a mislead.
Maybe he's not even British.

09:32.362 --> 09:36.137
If we drop that parameter, the database
will increase by a factor of almost 50.

09:36.265 --> 09:38.378
That's 750 possibilities.

09:38.474 --> 09:42.155
And a fair amount of those are missing
reliable visuals. In other words, no head shots.

09:42.251 --> 09:44.459
- "Tony."
- Yeah, Jack?

09:44.556 --> 09:47.786
What are the parameters for the search
outside of accent and appearance?

09:47.882 --> 09:51.051
As wide as we can make 'em.
All living males who have...

09:51.147 --> 09:53.580
- Change that.
- Change living?

09:53.708 --> 09:56.556
- Yeah. Change it to "presumed dead."
- Copy that.

10:04.238 --> 10:07.885
No. No.

10:07.981 --> 10:10.958
No. No.

10:11.086 --> 10:13.262
No.

10:13.359 --> 10:15.917
- There. That's him.
- Tony. Tony, that's him.

10:16.014 --> 10:19.758
- "Jack, you know this guy?"
- My God.

10:20.878 --> 10:23.151
- Jack.
- Yeah, I know him.

10:23.247 --> 10:26.479
His name is Stephen Saunders.
British Intelligence lent him to C. T.U...

10:26.575 --> 10:29.360
- for a mission in Kosovo.
- The one that targeted Victor Drazen?

10:29.455 --> 10:33.424
Yeah. I was the only one to get out.
Five others died, including Saunders.

10:33.521 --> 10:37.648
At least that's what I thought.
I was obviously wrong.

10:37.745 --> 10:41.105
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
I need a few minutes to think this through.

10:41.233 --> 10:44.530
- Jack, hurry.
- Son of a bitch.

11:02.164 --> 11:04.373
The situation at the hotel
seems to be under control.

11:04.468 --> 11:07.828
Now SWAT's in place. N.H.S. Is there
and will start the testing procedures soon.

11:07.956 --> 11:11.189
Any sense that
the press has picked up on this?

11:11.285 --> 11:14.005
No, David. Not so far.
But they're bound to before long.

11:14.102 --> 11:16.951
Containing the virus is crucial,
but containing the story that...

11:17.046 --> 11:19.093
it was released in a hotel
is just as important.

11:19.188 --> 11:22.421
If this story breaks,
we need a plausible cover.

11:22.518 --> 11:25.975
- I'll work up some scenarios.
- Don't use the term "Cordilla virus."

11:26.103 --> 11:29.143
People have never heard of it,
and the unknown creates more fear.

11:29.238 --> 11:32.471
Say it's similar to Legionnaires' disease.
People are familiar with that...

11:32.568 --> 11:35.256
- and they know it was handled successfully.
- Okay.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.297
- Mr. O'Laughlin.
- Mr. President.

11:38.392 --> 11:41.945
- Please.
- Thank you. Thank you very much. Mr. Palmer.

11:42.040 --> 11:47.258
Eleven vials of the virus are unaccounted for.
What's Homeland Security's assessment?

11:47.385 --> 11:49.753
Sir, we believe the threat level
should be raised to "red."

11:49.848 --> 11:52.089
Do it. What about
domestic air travel?

11:52.184 --> 11:55.482
It is our suggestion that flights
be grounded and airports be closed.

11:55.609 --> 11:58.715
Mr. President,
if your concern is to avoid panic...

11:58.810 --> 12:00.474
stopping air traffic
might have the opposite effect.

12:00.570 --> 12:02.939
That's better than allowing
a widespread release of the virus.

12:03.067 --> 12:06.171
If you shut down those airports, you won't
be able to explain it away with Legionnaires'.

12:06.267 --> 12:09.308
We're talking about
security issues, Mr. President.

12:09.403 --> 12:11.771
We are not talking about public relations.

12:11.868 --> 12:14.012
And how the public relates to this
"is" a security issue.

12:14.109 --> 12:16.861
Mr. President, we'd also
advocate shutting down...

12:16.957 --> 12:19.581
interstate rail and bus traffic
"in the interest" of...

12:19.676 --> 12:21.917
Listen, whoever has these vials
could already be in their cars.

12:22.012 --> 12:24.573
- Now we can't shut down every single highway...
- Mr. President, if...

12:24.669 --> 12:27.357
Gentlemen.

12:27.454 --> 12:31.581
Alert the airlines to a possible nationwide
shutdown, but wait for my authorization.

12:31.678 --> 12:34.622
Yes, sir.

12:34.750 --> 12:37.311
- Yes.
- Mr. President, I have a call on one.

12:37.407 --> 12:40.064
One moment, please.
Thank you, Mr. O'Laughlin.

12:40.159 --> 12:42.175
Thank you, Mr. President.

12:46.497 --> 12:48.641
It's him.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.520
Okay, guys. Here we go.
Start the trace.

12:58.337 --> 13:01.473
- Put the call through, please.
- "Yes, sir. Right away."

13:01.569 --> 13:03.874
- Mr. President.
- Yes.

13:03.969 --> 13:06.499
It's time for your first assignment.

13:06.594 --> 13:09.795
A very simple one, but one necessary
to our future relationship.

13:09.891 --> 13:14.563
- We don't have a relationship.
- No. You don't negotiate with terrorists.

13:14.659 --> 13:17.699
Well, I don't negotiate with heads of state,
so just do as you're told.

13:19.556 --> 13:22.659
Across the street from
your building is a mailbox.

13:22.755 --> 13:27.204
Have the Secret Service open it.
Inside is a package wrapped in black paper.

13:28.453 --> 13:30.693
Have them bring it to you
within 10 minutes.

13:30.789 --> 13:32.677
I'm not doing anything
until you tell me exactly...

13:41.543 --> 13:45.351
He didn't stay on long enough. Probably knew
we were going to try and trace the call.

13:46.791 --> 13:48.487
Send Secret Service
to pick up the package.

13:48.584 --> 13:51.976
All right, David. But it's gonna have to be
screened for explosives...

13:52.104 --> 13:54.887
- the virus...
- Then do it. Just make sure
it's back here in 10 minutes.

13:56.679 --> 13:58.504
All right.

14:10.570 --> 14:15.082
His file's still inactive. There's no evidence
that shows he surfaced after Kosovo.

14:15.178 --> 14:17.706
So for the past six years, he's been
letting everyone think he was dead.

14:17.803 --> 14:19.691
I don't think so.
No, if he survived...

14:19.787 --> 14:21.932
he'd have been captured
and sent to one of their prisons for years.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.554
Jack, if the mission failed,
maybe he was the reason.

14:24.650 --> 14:27.339
He could've betrayed the team, pretended
to be killed and gone over to the other side.

14:27.435 --> 14:31.435
You don't know Saunders. He was a patriot.
Something else happened to him.

14:31.532 --> 14:33.899
Who you calling?

14:33.996 --> 14:36.364
Ml-6.

14:36.460 --> 14:38.668
- Operations.
- This is Jack Bauer.

14:38.765 --> 14:42.093
- I need to speak with Trevor Tomlinson, please.
- One moment.

14:45.422 --> 14:49.454
- Hello, Jack.
- Trevor, has C.T.U. Brought you
up to speed on Saunders?

14:49.551 --> 14:53.008
Yeah. We've got his file up now.
There's no indication that he's still alive.

14:53.135 --> 14:56.750
Trust me, he is. You're gonna wanna do
a complete forensic protocol search.

14:56.846 --> 14:59.695
- It's being done as we speak.
- Do you think London would have additional data?

14:59.822 --> 15:02.192
On something like this?
No, it's local.

15:02.287 --> 15:05.744
One more thing. He's gonna want to deal
with people he knows. People he trusts.

15:05.871 --> 15:09.040
See if you can do a quick search on
all his past contacts.

15:09.136 --> 15:12.208
Great. Most of them have gone dark
or they're confirmed dead.

15:12.305 --> 15:15.697
Oh. Here's something.
A name. Diana White.

15:15.824 --> 15:19.601
Ran a high-class escort service
in Los Angeles in the late '80s.

15:19.698 --> 15:22.098
Catered to diplomats,
embassy employees, that sort of thing.

15:22.226 --> 15:25.841
Apparently, she passed a great deal of intel
to Saunders, and they became very close.

15:25.938 --> 15:28.050
They even lived together for a while.

15:28.146 --> 15:30.290
- Is she still living in Los Angeles?
- Yes.

15:30.387 --> 15:33.075
But she's been inactive
in intelligence circles for some time.

15:33.172 --> 15:36.083
Patch her file and every piece of information
you've got on her through to my computer.

15:36.210 --> 15:39.380
Thank you.

15:39.476 --> 15:42.100
I'd like to begin testing
the hotel staff...

15:43.604 --> 15:47.188
but it would really help if you would go first.

15:48.277 --> 15:50.518
- All right.
- Okay.

15:54.390 --> 15:57.750
- Name please?
- Michelle Dessler, C.T.U.

15:57.877 --> 16:01.174
Here you go. We're set.

16:05.752 --> 16:09.815
Okay, it's a nasal swab.
Every bit as reliable as a blood test...

16:09.911 --> 16:12.280
but it can be analyzed
much more quickly.

16:12.375 --> 16:15.608
- How quickly?
- We should have the results in two hours.

16:15.705 --> 16:18.168
Thank you.

16:18.296 --> 16:22.105
Next.

16:22.233 --> 16:25.690
- " Right in there."
- Right over here, sir. Sir, step over here.

16:29.241 --> 16:32.506
It's all right, sir.
There's nothing to be worried about.

16:32.602 --> 16:35.899
- " One person at a time."
- "It's a simple nasal swab."

16:36.026 --> 16:39.578
This phone is what was in the package
from Stephen Saunders.

16:39.675 --> 16:42.427
We scanned it. It's clean.

16:42.524 --> 16:44.412
Unfortunately, Mr. President...

16:44.539 --> 16:47.836
it's built with what's called
a subchannel chip...

16:47.932 --> 16:50.396
designed to receive a specific signal
that can't be traced.

16:50.525 --> 16:54.653
- I understand. Thank you, Aaron.
- Yes, sir.

16:59.485 --> 17:01.821
So this is the way he intends to
communicate from now on.

17:01.916 --> 17:05.310
- And if we really can't trace the call...
- We can't find him.

17:22.464 --> 17:26.593
- Yes.
- Good. You're using your new phone.

17:26.689 --> 17:28.417
Consider it our private line.

17:28.512 --> 17:31.040
And as you've no doubt been informed...

17:31.136 --> 17:34.433
- don't bother trying to trace my calls.
- What do you want?

17:34.561 --> 17:36.897
Within the next half hour,
you'll hold a televised press conference.

17:36.994 --> 17:40.418
- About what?
- Space program. The price of wheat.

17:40.545 --> 17:43.042
It's entirely up to you.
But at some point...

17:43.170 --> 17:46.211
you will use the phrase,
"The sky is falling."

17:46.306 --> 17:50.563
Use it however you like,
Mr. President, but use it.

17:58.308 --> 18:00.931
He wants me to call a press conference.
About what, it doesn't matter.

18:01.028 --> 18:03.524
Just use the phrase, "The sky is falling."

18:03.652 --> 18:05.605
David, it's a signal of some sort.
Maybe for an attack.

18:05.732 --> 18:07.621
Maybe for a wave of attacks.

18:07.717 --> 18:09.925
Maybe it's just a signal
to show that he's in control.

18:10.022 --> 18:12.741
Either way, you can't do it.
You can't give him that kind of power.

18:12.838 --> 18:15.206
- You saw what that virus does.
- I read the file, yeah.

18:15.302 --> 18:17.383
A thousand people
are dying as we speak, Wayne.

18:17.478 --> 18:20.902
Not just in a file, but in real life.
Right here in Los Angeles.

18:21.031 --> 18:23.270
And, David, I realize that.
But the problem becomes...

18:23.367 --> 18:27.016
But if I don't do what this man says,
it will be millions.

18:27.112 --> 18:29.801
If I can buy some time...

18:29.896 --> 18:33.000
maybe C.T.U. Can find this maniac
before things get out of hand.

18:34.440 --> 18:36.809
Call the press conference.

18:56.491 --> 18:58.220
- Yeah.
- She's there.

18:58.315 --> 19:00.684
Thank you. I'll let him know.
Diana White is at home.

19:00.780 --> 19:03.466
- We got anything new on her?
- Just more on the list of clientele she handled.

19:03.563 --> 19:06.283
Foreign dignitaries, heads of state.

19:06.380 --> 19:09.356
Even a high-ranking member of the Vatican,
most with a net worth of over 20 million.

19:09.484 --> 19:12.460
Her relationship with Saunders makes sense.
She gives the names of her clients...

19:12.588 --> 19:15.565
he blackmails them for information
by threatening to reveal who they are.

19:15.693 --> 19:17.709
You think that's how he got the money
to finance this operation?

19:17.837 --> 19:19.982
I think it's how he financed part of it.

19:21.614 --> 19:23.821
You knew Saunders.

19:23.918 --> 19:26.191
You said he was a good soldier.
What do you think happened?

19:26.286 --> 19:28.495
To be honest with you,
I don't know.

19:28.591 --> 19:30.736
I still can't believe
he survived the blast in Bosnia.

19:30.831 --> 19:34.414
They must have captured him.
Otherwise, he would've resurfaced.

19:34.510 --> 19:37.359
They would've put him in prison.

19:37.455 --> 19:39.952
Tortured him for
God knows how many years.

19:40.080 --> 19:41.936
Now he's holding
our government responsible.

19:42.032 --> 19:45.232
- But he was a British agent.
- "He was on loan to us."

19:45.328 --> 19:49.745
It was a U.S. Operation.
We left him behind.

19:53.138 --> 19:56.562
I left him behind.

20:01.395 --> 20:04.338
Look, I know you were studying this virus
even before it surfaced.

20:04.466 --> 20:07.826
- " Tony, this isn't the same strain."
- Maybe not exactly the same...

20:07.955 --> 20:09.363
but related, right?

20:09.459 --> 20:12.148
So you must have been working on a cure,
a vaccine, or something.

20:12.243 --> 20:14.132
Any research we have is based upon...

20:14.228 --> 20:17.140
I got a hotel full of people
dying out there... one of them's my wife.

20:17.268 --> 20:20.917
- So don't tell me there's nothing you can do!
- I wish there was. I'm sorry.

20:24.853 --> 20:28.822
- N.H.S.
- What'd they say?

20:31.414 --> 20:33.303
Anyone infected...

20:35.413 --> 20:37.302
it's a hundred percent mortality rate.

20:39.382 --> 20:43.831
You know, today, when Michelle
told Chappelle that...

20:43.959 --> 20:45.815
I should stand down
because of my wound...

20:49.848 --> 20:52.121
I barely even spoke to her.

20:52.216 --> 20:56.952
Tony, I can't tell you that I know
what you're going through because I don't.

20:58.361 --> 21:00.249
But if you need anything,
I'm here.

21:00.345 --> 21:04.827
- "Kim, would you excuse us?"
- Of course. Here's the file.

21:04.923 --> 21:06.809
Thanks.

21:08.634 --> 21:11.002
Have you cleared those
shared files with Division yet?

21:11.098 --> 21:14.267
No, I didn't get to it yet.
I had to take care of something.

21:14.363 --> 21:17.403
Yeah, I know what you were doing, Tony.
You're calling about Michelle.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.212
- She's my wife, Ryan.
- I understand that.

21:21.339 --> 21:23.932
But we're shorthanded
as it is. We can't afford...

21:24.028 --> 21:27.420
- I know how to do my job, all right?
- Yes, but you're not doing it.

21:27.548 --> 21:30.845
- You have to move on.
- "Move on"?

21:30.973 --> 21:32.862
What, are you acting like
she's already dead?

21:32.957 --> 21:36.382
Yes, I am. And so should you.

21:36.510 --> 21:40.125
We're at war, Tony.
I need your full attention.

21:40.221 --> 21:44.287
If you can't give it to me,
go home or maintain a vigil at the hotel.

21:44.382 --> 21:46.495
But if you stay here, I need you to focus.

21:46.591 --> 21:51.167
And the best way to do that is to assume
the worst and make it about getting revenge.

21:54.880 --> 21:57.824
Now, what's it gonna be?
Are you staying or not?

22:02.081 --> 22:04.289
What do you need?

22:04.385 --> 22:08.641
I've been hunting for any bank accounts
Amador may have used over the past few months...

22:08.768 --> 22:10.977
on the computer
we confiscated at the go club.

22:11.073 --> 22:16.162
If I can find something, maybe we can follow
the money trail back to this Stephen Saunders.

22:16.258 --> 22:18.786
- This offshore or domestic?
- Both.

22:18.913 --> 22:21.570
If I find anything suspicious,
I'll stream it to you.

22:21.667 --> 22:23.874
Coordinate with Division
on a substrata overlay.

22:23.971 --> 22:26.180
All right. You got it.

22:26.275 --> 22:30.339
- Thanks, Tony.
- "Yeah."

23:20.937 --> 23:22.889
Don't fire! I'm a federal agent.

23:23.018 --> 23:25.034
So what? You're in my house.

23:25.162 --> 23:29.931
Don't shoot.
I just wanna show you my identification.

23:30.059 --> 23:33.739
- What do you want?
- I need to talk to you about Stephen Saunders.

23:33.835 --> 23:36.235
Bastard.

23:36.364 --> 23:39.149
- "Put that gun down!"
- You first!

23:41.419 --> 23:45.196
Okay. I'm gonna put my gun down.

23:46.284 --> 23:48.173
Just take it easy.

23:54.605 --> 23:58.767
- Step out from behind there.
- Okay. I'm coming out.

24:01.486 --> 24:04.206
Just take it easy.

24:06.735 --> 24:09.199
Just stay calm.
I just wanna talk to you.

24:17.296 --> 24:19.280
Now, we can talk.

24:19.408 --> 24:21.713
Do you mind if I get dressed first?

24:23.184 --> 24:25.392
Go ahead.

24:40.692 --> 24:43.666
Tell me about you and Saunders.

24:43.794 --> 24:45.907
Stephen always told me
he'd protect me.

24:46.003 --> 24:48.500
I was young and stupid
and I believed him.

24:48.627 --> 24:50.516
When the work turned ugly,
he left me hanging.

24:50.612 --> 24:55.349
- What kind of work?
- It's a figure of speech.

24:55.444 --> 24:58.293
We know you acquired intelligence
for Stephen Saunders through your girls.

24:58.421 --> 25:00.789
I provided a service for wealthy men.

25:00.886 --> 25:04.342
How long do you think that would have
lasted if I betrayed their confidences?

25:04.469 --> 25:07.638
- So you're denying that you worked for him?
- Yes.

25:07.735 --> 25:10.071
I don't believe you.

25:10.166 --> 25:14.422
- I don't care.
- You will. Come on.

25:18.007 --> 25:22.743
Chase, call Tomlinson. Tell him we're
bringing Diana White in for questioning.

25:22.872 --> 25:26.776
- I'm not going anywhere without a lawyer.
- You're not under arrest.

25:26.904 --> 25:31.193
I'm taking you in to Ml-6,
where you'll be interrogated
by an agent of a foreign government.

25:31.321 --> 25:35.833
Your constitutional rights
no longer apply. Let's go.

25:56.219 --> 25:59.515
- Have you seen Gael?
- He doesn't have much time left.

25:59.612 --> 26:02.397
It's so fast.

26:05.086 --> 26:09.149
- Is he in a lot of pain?
- Michelle, you know the pathology of this virus.

26:10.462 --> 26:13.439
- I wanna see him.
- I wouldn't advise that.

26:15.134 --> 26:18.462
If I've been infected, I've been infected.
There's nothing anyone can do.

26:18.590 --> 26:20.350
That's not what I meant.

27:06.916 --> 27:10.372
- Do me a favor.
- Anything.

27:10.500 --> 27:13.349
Contact my family.

27:13.445 --> 27:18.180
Tell them that I love 'em.

27:18.308 --> 27:20.805
Tell them that I died quickly.
No pain.

27:22.373 --> 27:24.198
Of course.

27:41.512 --> 27:43.369
Gael.

27:48.680 --> 27:53.897
I was raised to believe suicide is a sin.

27:55.689 --> 28:00.906
No one could blame you in this world
or the next for ending your suffering.

28:01.898 --> 28:03.626
Are you so sure about that?

28:09.002 --> 28:12.619
A few seconds more.
That's all I needed.

28:14.284 --> 28:16.492
You know...

28:16.589 --> 28:20.459
when I was trying to stop
the cylinder from exploding...

28:20.588 --> 28:23.820
I hesitated... just a moment...

28:23.916 --> 28:26.285
because I was afraid.

28:28.558 --> 28:31.629
Then I forced myself
to move forward.

28:31.725 --> 28:35.502
If only I hadn't hesitated...

28:35.630 --> 28:38.895
"this might not be happening to" me...

28:38.991 --> 28:42.767
to all those poor people upstairs.

28:42.895 --> 28:47.216
- God.
- Gael, you did everything you could.

28:48.561 --> 28:50.351
I'm proud to have worked with you.

28:50.447 --> 28:54.928
You're one of... one of
the bravest men I've ever known.

28:56.753 --> 28:59.601
And I will make sure that your wife
and children know that.

29:53.079 --> 29:55.895
Homeland Security has raised
the threat level to "red."

29:55.991 --> 29:59.256
They're in constant contact with the F.B.I.
Set to move if"The sky is falling"...

29:59.351 --> 30:02.297
should trigger any kind of
suspicious activity.

30:02.425 --> 30:05.273
Is the F.A.A. Set to ground flights
and close the airports?

30:05.368 --> 30:08.441
- David, I think that's an overreaction.
- That was not my question.

30:08.537 --> 30:11.321
Yes.

30:11.418 --> 30:14.105
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

30:14.201 --> 30:18.394
Please, be seated. Good morning.

30:18.491 --> 30:21.435
I know the hour is unusual.

30:21.563 --> 30:24.794
But so are the times
in which we live.

30:24.891 --> 30:28.859
As a result of intelligence
on terrorist activity...

30:28.955 --> 30:33.180
gathered by the office of
Homeland Security and other agencies...

30:33.277 --> 30:37.564
I'm announcing that a threat level "red"
exists throughout the United States.

30:37.692 --> 30:42.205
Therefore, I'm ordering the grounding
of all domestic and international air traffic...

30:42.301 --> 30:45.629
and the closing of airports.

30:45.757 --> 30:50.078
I'm not taking this action
because the sky is falling...

30:53.503 --> 30:56.446
but I'd rather be overprotective
than underprepared.

30:56.574 --> 31:00.991
And as always, diligence and calm
are your best weapons...

31:01.119 --> 31:03.968
against the insidious nature
of the enemy.

31:04.095 --> 31:05.919
And God willing...

31:06.015 --> 31:09.952
we and all those who love freedom,
will remain safe and secure.

31:10.080 --> 31:12.512
- Thank you.
- Mr. President, can we have questions, please?

31:12.641 --> 31:15.360
Excuse me. Excuse me.
This is not a Q & A session.

31:15.456 --> 31:18.305
The president has made a statement,
and he has nothing more to add.

31:18.401 --> 31:20.770
- Thank you very much.
- One moment.

31:21.858 --> 31:23.298
Maybe a couple of questions.

31:23.427 --> 31:24.995
- Mr. President.
- Phil.

31:25.121 --> 31:29.186
- Is the United States currently under attack?
- This is a preventive measure.

31:29.282 --> 31:31.971
What are you preventing, sir, and do you think
the American public will accept...

31:32.066 --> 31:35.842
the grounding of air traffic based on
the rather vague justification you've given?

31:35.971 --> 31:39.171
The exact nature of the threat
is something I can't go into at this time.

31:43.205 --> 31:45.509
- Hello, Jack.
- Trevor, this is my partner, Chase Edmunds.

31:45.605 --> 31:48.836
Chase Edmunds, Trevor Tomlinson.
And this is Miss Diana White.

31:48.933 --> 31:52.325
Miss White. We've done some
additional checking.

31:52.453 --> 31:55.686
She's the registered owner of the address
in Chinatown where Saunders was last seen.

31:55.783 --> 31:58.629
- But I haven't seen him.
- You might want to think that through,
Miss White.

31:58.725 --> 32:01.350
You think he'd put himself
on the line like this for you?

32:01.445 --> 32:05.095
- We've begun vetting the raw data
we collected on Saunders.
- You sent it to London yet?

32:05.191 --> 32:07.207
No. It's still in
our system downstairs.

32:07.334 --> 32:10.663
London wants us to get as far as we can
before transmitting.

32:10.791 --> 32:12.839
Get down!

32:23.913 --> 32:28.328
- She's dead! Chase, are you hit?
- I got it in the vest!

32:29.737 --> 32:31.689
Cover me!

32:37.258 --> 32:41.675
Trevor, the Saunders computer file,
what server did you store it on?

32:41.802 --> 32:45.451
- A-5.
- We gotta get down to the computer room.

32:45.548 --> 32:47.755
Use the stairs. Go!

32:56.013 --> 32:59.500
There's no way that Saunders took out
this entire place just to kill Diana White.

32:59.628 --> 33:03.021
Ml-6 has information in their systems that
doesn't exist anywhere else in the world.

33:03.149 --> 33:04.621
We need to get it.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.401
I'll get the door.

33:51.635 --> 33:54.132
Room's clear. Check him out.

34:30.360 --> 34:31.895
- Chase?
- What?

34:32.023 --> 34:34.743
We got a bomb.

34:34.840 --> 34:38.136
- "How much time?"
- None. You gotta go now.

34:41.112 --> 34:43.896
- Go now!
- Jack, I'm not leaving you!

34:43.993 --> 34:46.297
Get out of here! It's an order! Go now!

34:57.307 --> 35:01.564
I got it! Go! Go! Go! Go!

35:45.120 --> 35:47.296
- Almeida.
- Tony, it's me.

35:47.392 --> 35:51.618
Gael's dead.

35:51.713 --> 35:54.945
He was suffering so badly.

35:55.041 --> 35:57.602
No one should have to
go through what he did.

35:59.266 --> 36:01.634
Tony, there are
children upstairs...

36:01.731 --> 36:04.129
who are going to die in agony...

36:04.257 --> 36:06.082
in front of their parents' eyes.

36:09.474 --> 36:12.643
Michelle, unfortunately, there's nothing
we can do for them right now.

36:12.740 --> 36:16.515
Actually, there is.
Field Ops has a supply of capsules.

36:16.612 --> 36:19.620
Those capsules are for
field agents that are captured.

36:19.748 --> 36:22.917
Yeah. I-I know what they're for. They're
for committing suicide to prevent torture...

36:23.013 --> 36:24.548
and that's exactly
what they'd be used for here.

36:24.676 --> 36:28.133
We could make them available
to anyone who's symptomatic.

36:28.261 --> 36:31.750
- It would be their choice.
- You know I'm not authorized to do that.

36:31.878 --> 36:35.012
I'm not interested in
what's authorized.

36:35.109 --> 36:40.646
Michelle, you're talking about mass suicide
facilitated by an agency of the government.

36:40.743 --> 36:43.335
I'm talking about common decency.

36:43.431 --> 36:46.119
If you could've seen Gael...

36:46.214 --> 36:49.384
I'm calling because...

36:49.479 --> 36:51.496
if it was me...

36:53.577 --> 36:57.353
If I'm infected,
I know what I'd want.

37:00.297 --> 37:03.146
We don't have much time.

37:03.242 --> 37:05.515
Gael was the first to die
because he was the first exposed...

37:05.608 --> 37:07.625
but others won't be far behind.

37:07.753 --> 37:10.730
I'll see what I can do.

37:12.298 --> 37:14.026
Thank you.

37:15.243 --> 37:17.610
Mr. Chappelle, line two.

37:20.203 --> 37:22.411
- Chappelle.
- Ryan, it's Jack.

37:22.508 --> 37:25.644
- Almost the entire Ml-6 office
has just been wiped out.
- What?

37:25.741 --> 37:28.364
They took out a woman that we believe
had recent contact with Saunders.

37:28.460 --> 37:31.309
They also took out most of their personnel,
including Tomlinson...

37:31.404 --> 37:34.413
which means Saunders has a much larger
organization in Los Angeles than we thought.

37:34.542 --> 37:38.252
It also makes him more visible,
easier to find. Have you got anything yet?

37:38.349 --> 37:41.037
I don't know.
I'm trying to follow the money trail.

37:41.134 --> 37:44.014
I've narrowed it down to a few dozen
offshore banks, but it's gonna take some time.

37:44.142 --> 37:46.638
Look, one of the things that
Saunders was trying to destroy...

37:46.766 --> 37:49.135
was all the information
that Ml-6 had gathered on him.

37:49.230 --> 37:51.950
I managed to retrieve the hard drive
that was storing that information.

37:52.047 --> 37:53.871
I need you to call London,
get their protocols...

37:53.967 --> 37:57.137
and I want you to assemble a team that's
ready to start striping data off this thing.

37:57.231 --> 38:01.168
- All right. I'll put Chloe on it right away.
- Okay.

38:17.809 --> 38:21.202
Suicide capsules for the people
down at the hotel.

38:21.330 --> 38:23.475
It's gonna get pretty bad down there.

38:23.570 --> 38:26.387
It's against every regulation in the book.

38:26.484 --> 38:28.530
Yeah.

38:33.428 --> 38:35.316
Do it.

38:40.115 --> 38:42.260
I've been trying to call
Pach, but there's no answer.

38:42.356 --> 38:45.205
He's dead. So's Young.

38:45.333 --> 38:47.702
Taken out in the Ml-6 operation.

38:47.797 --> 38:52.214
- And Bauer?
- He and his partner got out before the explosion.

38:52.341 --> 38:55.510
- But the hard drive was completely destroyed.
- Completely.

38:55.606 --> 38:58.775
- What about Diana?
- Dead.

38:58.872 --> 39:02.039
I'll miss her.

39:04.119 --> 39:06.168
There's one more thing.

39:06.296 --> 39:09.751
There've been some inquiries
made about the bank in Cayman.

39:09.879 --> 39:12.760
- By whom?
- They're coming from C.T.U.

39:12.887 --> 39:14.712
A man named Ryan Chappelle.

39:14.808 --> 39:17.977
I know Chappelle.

39:18.073 --> 39:21.753
Apparently, he's quite good
at following money trails.

39:21.849 --> 39:25.146
Is he? Carry on.

39:46.844 --> 39:48.860
I'll tell him myself.

39:54.301 --> 39:56.446
What is it?

39:56.541 --> 39:59.230
There was just an attack
on the L.A. Office of Ml-6.

39:59.326 --> 40:01.085
Jack Bauer was there at the time.

40:01.182 --> 40:05.886
- Is he all right?
- Yeah. He's on his way back to C.T.U.

40:05.983 --> 40:10.816
Any indication that the attack was triggered
by what I said at the press conference?

40:10.944 --> 40:13.375
David, we don't know
what triggered the attack.

40:13.502 --> 40:15.327
So it could've been what I said?

40:17.344 --> 40:20.320
How was the attack carried out?

40:20.448 --> 40:23.616
By helicopter and two men inside.

40:23.712 --> 40:26.240
All right. So they
have to land it somewhere.

40:26.369 --> 40:29.954
I want F.A.A. To coordinate with
Homeland Security and Border Patrol.

40:30.049 --> 40:33.633
Right away, Mr. President.

40:41.604 --> 40:44.514
- What?
- I enjoyed your press conference, Mr. President.

40:44.642 --> 40:47.811
- It's good to know the sky's not falling.
- What do you want?

40:47.907 --> 40:50.116
To give you your next assignment.

40:50.211 --> 40:54.180
A sort of preliminary action to clear
the decks before the main event to come.

40:54.308 --> 40:57.284
There's a man named Ryan Chappelle.

40:57.412 --> 41:00.101
- Regional Director of C.T.U.
- Yeah, what about him?

41:00.197 --> 41:02.213
- I want him killed.
- What?

41:02.342 --> 41:06.661
At 7:00 a.m., have his body delivered to
the train yard downtown, off the main line.

41:06.790 --> 41:10.727
- It's out of the question.
- What a shame.

41:10.854 --> 41:12.839
Before you decide, you might want to...

41:12.968 --> 41:14.790
drop by the Chandler Plaza Hotel.

41:14.886 --> 41:16.775
Take a good look at what's happening.

41:16.870 --> 41:20.679
Then imagine the same event taking place
at hundreds of locations all over the country.

41:20.807 --> 41:23.975
You're insane.

41:25.095 --> 41:27.112
What does he want?

41:28.680 --> 41:30.569
David?

41:31.305 --> 41:37.306
