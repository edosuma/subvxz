Don't remind me.

08:41.605 --> 08:44.066
Emma, I need advice.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.210
- Are you as good
- with relationships

08:45.234 --> 08:46.818
As you are with shopping?

08:46.944 --> 08:48.091
Well, shopping is

08:48.092 --> 08:49.238
like my superpower.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.428
Butting into other

08:51.429 --> 08:53.492
people's business

08:49.363 --> 08:53.492
is more of a hobby.

08:53.617 --> 08:55.036
So have you noticed that

08:55.037 --> 08:56.454
Jessie's been spending

08:56.620 --> 08:57.976
a lot of time with this

08:57.977 --> 08:59.331
Officer Petey character?

08:59.457 --> 09:00.729
Oh, Tony, Petey's not

09:00.730 --> 09:02.000
interested in Jessie.

09:02.126 --> 09:03.168
I'm surprised you are.

09:03.294 --> 09:05.046
Have you seen her

09:05.047 --> 09:06.797
eat barbecue? Ugh!

09:06.922 --> 09:09.508
I sure have.

09:09.633 --> 09:10.759
I don't think you have

09:10.760 --> 09:11.885
anything to worry about.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.116
But if you want,

09:13.117 --> 09:14.221
I can do some

09:12.010 --> 09:14.221
snooping around.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.098
- I know where
- Jessie keeps her diary.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.558
I read it to put

09:17.559 --> 09:18.892
myself to sleep.

09:19.017 --> 09:20.018
Thanks, Emma.

09:20.144 --> 09:21.520
My pleasure, Tony.

09:21.645 --> 09:23.415
- You know - there isn't anything
- I wouldn't do for...

09:23.439 --> 09:24.600
- (GASPS)
- (SCREAMING) Shoes!

09:26.650 --> 09:27.651
See ya, Tommy!

09:34.741 --> 09:35.909
You do your improv

09:35.910 --> 09:37.077
at the Twin Dragon

09:34.741 --> 09:37.077
Noodle Cafe?

09:37.202 --> 09:38.202
And theater.

09:39.663 --> 09:41.332
Welcome to the

09:41.333 --> 09:43.000
big time, kiddo.

09:43.125 --> 09:45.169
Now remember,

09:45.170 --> 09:47.212
improv is just comedy

09:43.125 --> 09:47.212
without a script.

09:47.338 --> 09:48.755
- You make it up
- as you go.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.028
There's only one rule.

09:50.029 --> 09:51.175
Do you know what it is?

09:51.300 --> 09:52.926
- No.
- Okay, you just broke it!

09:54.386 --> 09:56.034
No matter what,

09:56.035 --> 09:57.681
you never say no.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.955
Huh. That's how Bertram

09:59.956 --> 10:02.144
feels about naps.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.854
Okay, whenever someone

10:03.855 --> 10:05.439
asks you a question,

10:02.269 --> 10:05.439
the answer is always,

10:05.564 --> 10:07.649
"Yes, and..."

10:07.774 --> 10:09.152
That way the scene

10:09.153 --> 10:10.528
keeps going and

10:07.774 --> 10:10.528
the ideas keep flowing.

10:10.652 --> 10:11.529
Got it?

10:11.653 --> 10:13.531
Yes, and...

10:13.655 --> 10:15.574
That's all I got.

10:15.699 --> 10:17.201
Okay, new rule.

10:17.202 --> 10:18.702
Be funny.

10:20.538 --> 10:21.955
Okay.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.231
My father was so upset

10:27.232 --> 10:28.753
he just,

10:25.709 --> 10:28.753
he couldn't stop crying.

10:28.879 --> 10:29.984
Yes, and then

10:29.985 --> 10:31.089
your mother said,

10:31.215 --> 10:33.091
- "I'll give him something
- to cry about."

10:33.217 --> 10:34.385
Excuse me?

10:34.510 --> 10:36.345
- Yes, and then
- she slapped him!

10:36.470 --> 10:37.555
(SOBBING)

10:38.597 --> 10:39.931
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh, we're not,

10:40.057 --> 10:41.454
We're not doing

10:41.455 --> 10:42.851
improv right now, are we?

10:42.976 --> 10:44.040
No, I'm talking about

10:44.041 --> 10:45.103
my grandma's funeral.

10:45.229 --> 10:47.523
But good effort.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.028
Did you just make

10:52.029 --> 10:53.070
Malcolm cry?

10:53.195 --> 10:54.697
Yes, and I'm pretty sure

10:54.698 --> 10:56.198
I'm not gonna be invited

10:53.195 --> 10:56.198
to his grandma's wake.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.285
BERTRAM: So why the disguise?

11:00.411 --> 11:01.996
I do not want Zuri to know

11:01.997 --> 11:03.581
I am spying on her.

11:03.747 --> 11:05.249
Okay, but I think

11:05.250 --> 11:06.750
the seven-foot lizard

11:03.747 --> 11:06.750
might give you away.

11:07.376 --> 11:08.752
(GROWLING)

11:11.505 --> 11:13.215
Good afternoon, ladies.

11:15.092 --> 11:15.759
(CHOMPING)

11:15.800 --> 11:17.595
(SCREAMS)

11:17.761 --> 11:19.054
Oh! Sorry about that.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.598
Scooter's teething.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.015
(SCREAMS)

11:22.140 --> 11:23.809
Don't worry. His saliva

11:23.810 --> 11:25.477
is only a little toxic!

11:28.606 --> 11:30.295
Zuri, I do not

11:30.296 --> 11:31.983
want my babies

11:28.606 --> 11:31.983
biting strangers.

11:32.109 --> 11:33.194
We do not know

11:33.195 --> 11:34.278
where they have been.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.323
And why are my little ones

11:37.324 --> 11:38.782
not wearing sunscreen?

11:38.823 --> 11:40.659
Like they do

11:40.660 --> 11:42.494
in the jungle?

11:42.620 --> 11:43.872
No back talk, please.

11:43.873 --> 11:45.122
It sets a bad example.

11:50.127 --> 11:52.046
Now, Mrs. Kipling and I

11:52.047 --> 11:53.964
are going to the groomer

11:50.127 --> 11:53.964
to get our claws done.

11:54.089 --> 11:55.299
Please be very careful with

11:55.300 --> 11:56.508
her precious hatchlings.

11:59.261 --> 12:00.804
Oh, don't worry.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.077
I'll guard them

12:02.078 --> 12:03.265
with my life.

12:05.000 --> 12:11.074

12:13.233 --> 12:14.256
TONY: (ON INTERCOM)

12:14.257 --> 12:15.277
Psst! Emma!

12:16.278 --> 12:17.904
God?

12:19.323 --> 12:21.679
I know you're there

12:21.680 --> 12:24.035
because I just got

12:19.323 --> 12:24.035
40 pairs of new shoes!

12:24.161 --> 12:26.121
It's me, Tony.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.039
Jessie's on her way up.

12:28.165 --> 12:30.125
- Find out if she's
- fallen in love with Petey,

12:30.250 --> 12:32.312
- Planning to have five kids,
- and move to New Jersey.

12:32.336 --> 12:33.942
Don't be ridiculous.

12:33.943 --> 12:35.547
Nobody moves to New Jersey.

12:38.133 --> 12:39.218
Hey, Jessie!

12:39.219 --> 12:40.302
You look happy.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.304
Why?

12:42.429 --> 12:43.430
Because I had

12:43.431 --> 12:44.431
a few hours off?

12:44.556 --> 12:46.058
To which I am

12:46.059 --> 12:47.559
contractually entitled.

12:47.685 --> 12:49.144
We need to chat.

12:50.854 --> 12:53.023
Whoa!

12:53.148 --> 12:55.275
Okay, once I had

12:55.276 --> 12:57.402
a favorite pair of

12:53.148 --> 12:57.402
peep-toe heels.

12:57.528 --> 12:58.550
I loved them,

12:58.551 --> 12:59.571
but then I got a cute

12:57.528 --> 12:59.571
new pair of wedges,

12:59.697 --> 13:01.469
which made my peep-Tonys,

13:01.470 --> 13:03.241
I mean, my peep-toes

13:04.242 --> 13:06.036
really jealous and sad,

13:06.161 --> 13:08.518
which wasn't fair, because

13:08.519 --> 13:10.874
they were cute and loyal

13:06.161 --> 13:10.874
and meant for me.

13:10.915 --> 13:11.916
Do you get

13:11.917 --> 13:12.917
what I'm saying?

13:13.043 --> 13:14.211
If you want your shoes back,

13:14.212 --> 13:15.379
why don't you just ask?

13:16.880 --> 13:18.965
Here. There.

13:20.175 --> 13:22.052
- Thanks for
- stretching them out!

13:22.177 --> 13:23.554
- They used to be
- a size six.

13:23.679 --> 13:25.076
Now a little old woman

13:25.077 --> 13:26.473
could raise a family in them!

13:29.893 --> 13:31.291
You think slinging

13:31.292 --> 13:32.688
lemonade is tough?

13:32.896 --> 13:34.523
I'm running myself ragged,

13:34.648 --> 13:35.775
while Ravi's

13:35.776 --> 13:36.900
at the nail salon

13:37.025 --> 13:38.172
sitting on his

13:38.173 --> 13:39.319
penny-pinching,

13:37.025 --> 13:39.319
lizard-loving...

13:39.444 --> 13:41.279
(CLEAR THROAT)

13:41.405 --> 13:43.448
Oh, hi, boss!

13:45.075 --> 13:46.431
Nice manicure.

13:46.432 --> 13:47.786
Shiny buff?

13:49.913 --> 13:50.789
Where are my babies?

13:50.914 --> 13:52.290
Uh, playing.

13:52.416 --> 13:53.501
Playing where? With whom?

13:53.502 --> 13:54.585
Do we know their parents?

13:55.419 --> 13:57.546
Relax. The baby lizards

13:57.671 --> 13:59.923
are right over there.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.487
You let them go?

14:01.488 --> 14:02.967
Unleashed and unsupervised?

14:04.803 --> 14:06.346
- And now
- you have lost them!

14:06.471 --> 14:08.515
(SCREAMING)

14:10.642 --> 14:12.352
Oh, I just remembered.

14:12.477 --> 14:13.478
- They're over
- there.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.941
Oh, and I just remembered,

14:18.066 --> 14:19.797
you are fired,

14:19.798 --> 14:21.528
like a tikka kebab

14:18.066 --> 14:21.528
in a clay oven!

14:26.950 --> 14:28.118
Can you believe

14:28.119 --> 14:29.286
how some people

14:26.950 --> 14:29.286
treat their servants?

14:30.036 --> 14:31.955
No, I can't.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.292
Get me some peanuts.

14:40.631 --> 14:41.653
Jessie, how about

14:41.654 --> 14:42.674
a movie later?

14:42.800 --> 14:43.801
Oh, I'd love to,

14:43.802 --> 14:44.802
but I can't tonight.

14:44.968 --> 14:45.990
I'm doing my first ever

14:45.991 --> 14:47.011
improv performance.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.347
Oh. Is Petey

14:48.348 --> 14:49.556
going to be there?

14:49.681 --> 14:51.308
- Of course.
- Then I want to come.

14:51.975 --> 14:53.435
Oh.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.812
Thanks, but

14:54.813 --> 14:56.062
it's my first time

14:53.560 --> 14:56.062
in front of an audience,

14:56.187 --> 14:57.588
- and I'm already
- kind of nervous.

14:57.689 --> 14:58.837
I'd rather wait until

14:58.838 --> 14:59.983
I'm better for you to come.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.265
- Thank you
- for understanding.

15:04.446 --> 15:05.719
Did you see that?

15:05.720 --> 15:06.990
She just blew me off.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.054
Obviously,

15:08.055 --> 15:09.075
she and Petey

15:07.031 --> 15:09.075
are a thing!

15:09.200 --> 15:10.285
I guess she just prefers

15:10.286 --> 15:11.369
a man in uniform.

15:11.495 --> 15:12.663
You're wearing a uniform.

15:14.038 --> 15:16.040
Oh, right. I should

15:16.041 --> 15:18.042
point that out!

15:18.168 --> 15:19.524
Look, if you really

15:19.525 --> 15:20.879
want to know what

15:18.168 --> 15:20.879
Jessie and Petey are up to,

15:21.004 --> 15:22.235
there's only

15:22.236 --> 15:23.465
one way to find out.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.485
- You and I should - just sneak into the
- Performance ourselves

15:25.509 --> 15:27.349
- And see how they act
- when you're not there.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.095
- But Jessie told me
- not to come.

15:29.220 --> 15:30.431
Who cares what she says?

15:30.432 --> 15:31.640
She's cheating on you!

15:32.683 --> 15:33.558
Just kidding.

15:33.684 --> 15:34.058
Oh.

15:34.184 --> 15:35.184
Probably.

15:37.228 --> 15:38.429
- You're right.
- We should go.

15:38.605 --> 15:39.605
Wait!

15:39.690 --> 15:41.024
- What if
- we can't get tickets?

15:41.107 --> 15:42.254
It's a bunch of

15:42.255 --> 15:43.401
unknowns doing improv

15:43.527 --> 15:45.466
on a weeknight in the

15:45.467 --> 15:47.405
back room of a noodle shop.

15:43.527 --> 15:47.405
I doubt it's sold out.

15:52.202 --> 15:55.205
Boy, it sure is hot here

15:55.330 --> 15:57.207
on the sun!

15:57.332 --> 15:58.709
- We should've
- come at night!

16:01.044 --> 16:02.421
See?

16:02.422 --> 16:03.797
They're just doing improv.

16:03.922 --> 16:05.507
It's not romantic or funny.

16:09.177 --> 16:10.595
You ordered food?

16:10.721 --> 16:12.401
- A jealous rage can
- work up an appetite!

16:13.557 --> 16:17.101
Hey, I like your spacesuit.

16:17.227 --> 16:18.937
- He can't
- talk to her like that!

16:19.062 --> 16:20.647
Thanks, I got it

16:20.648 --> 16:22.232
on sale at the

16:19.062 --> 16:22.232
Zero Gravity Galleria.

16:22.357 --> 16:23.630
"Everything goes up

16:23.631 --> 16:24.902
but our prices!"

16:28.154 --> 16:29.698
- I don't know
- what stinks worse,

16:29.823 --> 16:31.282
- This scene
- or those fish balls.

16:33.284 --> 16:34.953
Let's go.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.830
- They're delicious,
- and we're staying.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.270
I need to make sure

16:38.271 --> 16:39.583
no funny business happens.

16:39.708 --> 16:40.814
The name of the troupe

16:40.815 --> 16:41.919
is Noodle-Doodle-Do.

16:42.085 --> 16:43.337
Trust me, nothing funny

16:43.338 --> 16:44.588
is going to happen.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.258
PETEY: Oh, thanks!

16:48.383 --> 16:50.093
Thanks so much!

16:50.176 --> 16:51.490
For our last scene,

16:51.491 --> 16:52.804
we need an occupation.

16:52.930 --> 16:54.222
Girlfriend-stealing cop!

16:55.432 --> 16:58.101
Way to be subtle.

16:58.226 --> 17:00.374
Got it! Here is

17:00.375 --> 17:02.522
a scene entitled

16:58.226 --> 17:02.522
"Girlfriend-stealing Cop."

17:07.109 --> 17:08.444
Oh!

(SQUEAKING)

17:21.124 --> 17:22.250
Is this your girlfriend?

17:22.251 --> 17:23.376
Sure is.

17:23.501 --> 17:24.523
Ha! I do not care!

17:24.525 --> 17:25.545
I am French

17:23.501 --> 17:25.545
and I am stealing her.

17:27.798 --> 17:28.820
Ooh, la, la!

17:28.821 --> 17:29.841
Uh-huh-huh!

17:29.967 --> 17:31.760
Step out of the car.

17:31.761 --> 17:33.553
And let us dance.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.847
One, two.

17:35.973 --> 17:37.766
- I told you
- he was a snake!

17:37.891 --> 17:38.935
He's only doing

17:38.936 --> 17:39.977
what you suggested!

17:40.602 --> 17:42.395
Oh!

17:42.520 --> 17:43.835
Ooh, Officer Pierre,

17:43.836 --> 17:45.148
you're making me forget

17:42.520 --> 17:45.148
all about my boyfriend!

17:45.273 --> 17:46.296
Uh-huh-huh!

17:46.297 --> 17:47.317
What?

17:47.442 --> 17:49.152
- I need a suggestion
- for a body part!

17:49.235 --> 17:50.487
ALL: Face!

17:56.493 --> 17:58.161
Tony, what are you doing?

17:58.286 --> 17:59.955
We can't use props!

18:03.792 --> 18:05.189
Who is a cute little lizard?

18:05.190 --> 18:06.586
You are.

18:09.965 --> 18:12.009
Hmm, I suppose

18:12.010 --> 18:14.052
you came to apologize.

18:14.177 --> 18:16.179
You supposed wrong.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.640
You owe me money.

18:17.641 --> 18:19.016
So make it rain.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.353
- I will not even
- make it drizzle!

18:23.478 --> 18:25.335
You abandoned my poor,

18:25.336 --> 18:27.190
defenseless lizards!

18:27.315 --> 18:28.817
Defenseless?

18:28.942 --> 18:30.339
They gnawed the wrinkles

18:30.340 --> 18:31.736
off that old lady's face!

18:31.862 --> 18:33.197
Because you were

18:33.198 --> 18:34.531
not watching them!

18:34.656 --> 18:35.929
I trusted you with

18:35.930 --> 18:37.200
their little lives!

18:37.241 --> 18:39.202
- Well, that was
- your first mistake.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.037
To save time, I just keep

18:41.038 --> 18:42.789
my goldfish in the toilet!

18:42.914 --> 18:44.103
Until you apologize,

18:44.104 --> 18:45.291
we are not speaking.

18:45.416 --> 18:46.877
And till you pay me,

18:46.878 --> 18:48.336
we're not speaking.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.151
Very well.

18:50.152 --> 18:51.840
Let the veil of silence

18:48.461 --> 18:51.840
descend upon us.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.175
Henceforth,

18:53.176 --> 18:54.384
not a single sound

18:51.965 --> 18:54.384
shall be uttered by...

18:54.509 --> 18:56.866
Hup! Clearly you do not

18:56.867 --> 18:59.222
understand the meaning

18:54.509 --> 18:59.222
of not speaking!

19:02.851 --> 19:03.936
I'm really, really sorry

19:03.937 --> 19:05.020
I ruined your show, Jessie.

19:05.228 --> 19:07.230
You should be.

19:07.231 --> 19:09.232
I haven't been

19:05.228 --> 19:09.232
that embarrassed since...

19:09.357 --> 19:11.484
Okay, well, it actually

19:11.485 --> 19:13.611
hasn't been that long,

19:09.357 --> 19:13.611
but I'm still mad at you.

19:13.737 --> 19:15.613
- And you have
- every right to be.

19:15.739 --> 19:17.240
- It just seems like
- you and Petey

19:17.323 --> 19:18.680
Have so much in common,

19:18.681 --> 19:20.035
I feel left out.

19:20.243 --> 19:21.804
- I can't believe - I let my jealousy
- Get the best of me.

19:21.828 --> 19:22.537
That was so stupid.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.039
That was stupid.

19:26.875 --> 19:28.376
And I loved it.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.774
No guy has ever

19:29.775 --> 19:31.046
violently noodled

19:28.501 --> 19:31.046
somebody for me before.

19:33.131 --> 19:34.841
You're the best, Jessie.

19:34.966 --> 19:36.301
And it's not like

19:36.302 --> 19:37.635
Petey's always gonna

19:34.966 --> 19:37.635
be hanging around, right?

19:37.761 --> 19:39.387
Right.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.264
So, no hard feelings?

19:41.347 --> 19:42.704
Nah. Improv is

19:42.705 --> 19:44.059
a dangerous business.

19:44.267 --> 19:45.331
I knew that

19:45.332 --> 19:46.394
when I signed up.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.063
- In that case,
- would you mind?

19:48.271 --> 19:49.272
Of course.

19:53.276 --> 19:54.277
And you should

19:54.278 --> 19:55.278
keep going to

19:53.276 --> 19:55.278
improv with Petey.

19:55.403 --> 19:57.280
- I promise I won't
- get jealous again.

19:57.405 --> 19:59.074
Great! So, Petey,

19:59.075 --> 20:00.742
when's our next class?

20:00.867 --> 20:03.120
Yeah, about that.

20:03.244 --> 20:04.892

20:03.244 --> 20:06.539

did not accept your

20:07.750 --> 20:08.833
application to join.

20:08.959 --> 20:10.961
What? Who's on the board?

20:11.086 --> 20:12.670
- Malcolm, Chef Chung,
- and myself.

20:14.338 --> 20:16.424
I'm sorry about that.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.009
Well, I've got to go.

20:18.135 --> 20:19.844
- I'm late for Malcolm's
- grandma's wake.

20:19.970 --> 20:20.637
I'd invite you,

20:20.762 --> 20:21.471
but, you know...

20:21.596 --> 20:23.473
Yeah.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.017
Aw, man!

20:26.143 --> 20:27.311
Now I got you booted

20:27.312 --> 20:28.478
out of Noodle-Doodle-Do.

20:29.479 --> 20:31.148
It's okay.

20:31.272 --> 20:33.126
- At least now I'll have - more time
to spend - With my favorite guy.

20:33.150 --> 20:35.193
A new guy? Who is he?

20:35.194 --> 20:37.236
I'll pound him

20:33.150 --> 20:37.236
like a veal cutlet!

20:37.361 --> 20:38.237
It's you, ya dope.

20:38.362 --> 20:39.489
Oh, right.

20:39.614 --> 20:41.116
Stupid jealousy.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.784
Hmm.

20:42.909 --> 20:43.953
Will you forgive me

20:43.954 --> 20:44.995
if I take you out

20:42.909 --> 20:44.995
for a nice dinner?

20:45.996 --> 20:47.371
Yes, and...

20:47.497 --> 20:48.957
Buy you flowers?

20:49.082 --> 20:50.583
Yes, and...

20:50.708 --> 20:52.709
- Take you for - a carriage ride
- Around the park?

20:52.794 --> 20:54.378
Yes, and...

20:54.504 --> 20:55.606
- And if this
- doesn't end soon,

20:55.630 --> 20:57.111
- I'm gonna have to
- take out a loan.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.093
You're forgiven.

21:02.345 --> 21:03.847
- Ooh, I love
- carriage rides!

21:03.972 --> 21:05.307
I call shotgun!

21:05.308 --> 21:06.641
Come on.

21:09.352 --> 21:11.646

please just go to bed!

21:14.524 --> 21:15.524
(SOBBING)

21:16.943 --> 21:18.883
Wow, babies are a real pain.

21:18.884 --> 21:20.822
And it just gets harder.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.782
Wait till they start dating.

21:24.117 --> 21:25.535
What am I saying?

21:28.246 --> 21:29.811
Ravi, I know

21:29.812 --> 21:31.374
we're not speaking,

21:31.415 --> 21:32.521
but I really understand

21:32.522 --> 21:33.626
how you feel.

21:33.751 --> 21:35.170
Kids are tough.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.589
You're telling me.

21:38.715 --> 21:40.425
For a moment,

21:40.426 --> 21:42.135
I actually considered

21:38.715 --> 21:42.135
using the stapler.

21:43.386 --> 21:44.804
Maybe this will help.

21:47.431 --> 21:49.142
I made it for them.

21:49.267 --> 21:51.228
Well, actually for you.

21:53.104 --> 21:54.544
See? I decorated it

21:54.545 --> 21:55.982
like a jungle,

21:56.107 --> 21:57.650
so they'll feel at home.

21:57.775 --> 21:58.775
Thank you, Zuri.

22:00.611 --> 22:02.113
That is so thoughtful.

22:04.115 --> 22:05.200
Now that

22:05.201 --> 22:06.284
we are friends again,

22:06.409 --> 22:07.952
please, please, please,

22:07.953 --> 22:09.495
take the midnight feeding!

22:14.751 --> 22:16.378
Hey, just because Bertram

22:16.379 --> 22:18.004
banned lizards from his tub,

22:18.129 --> 22:19.810
- doesn't mean you can
- slither into mine.

22:21.591 --> 22:23.155
(SIGHS) Okay, fine.

22:23.156 --> 22:24.719
But don't use up

22:21.591 --> 22:24.719

22:24.844 --> 22:25.887
It won't help.
