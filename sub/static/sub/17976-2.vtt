PREVIOUSLY ON THE L WORD...

00:11.467 --> 00:12.667
SO IF IT'S JUST A SEX THING,

00:12.700 --> 00:14.700
THEN YOU CAN GET IT
UNDER CONTROL, RIGHT?

00:14.733 --> 00:16.267
IT IS COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY
OVER.

00:16.300 --> 00:17.667
DID YOU FUCK ALL NIGHT

00:17.700 --> 00:19.467
BEFORE YOU TOLD HER
I WAS THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE

00:19.500 --> 00:20.433
THIS MORNING?

00:22.133 --> 00:24.333
LOOKS LIKE I'LL BE
HAVING THIS BABY ON MY OWN.

00:24.367 --> 00:25.367
AND YOU'RE OKAY
WITH THAT?

00:25.400 --> 00:27.233
I WANT THIS BABY MORE THAN EVER.

00:27.267 --> 00:28.467
I KNOW IT'S NOT MY PLACE
TO JUDGE YOU,

00:28.500 --> 00:29.667
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON

00:29.700 --> 00:30.800
WITH YOU AND JENNY,

00:30.833 --> 00:32.233
BUT I THINK THIS IS WRONG.

00:32.267 --> 00:34.067
DID YOU GUYS HEAR
WHAT HAPPENED TO MARINA?

00:34.100 --> 00:35.767
NERVOUS BREAKDOWN--
COMPLETE AND TOTAL.

00:35.800 --> 00:36.633
I WANT TO SAY GOODBYE.

00:36.667 --> 00:38.100
OH, YEAH? YOU GOING SOMEWHERE?

00:38.133 --> 00:39.567
OHIO.
I TOOK A JOB THERE.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.133
I'M LEAVING THE DAY
AFTER TOMORROW.

00:41.167 --> 00:43.267
WHY DON'T YOU STAY HERE,
TAKE OVER THE LEASE?

00:43.300 --> 00:45.200
I CAN'T AFFORD THE RENT
ON THIS HOUSE.

00:45.233 --> 00:47.033
KIT, I DON'T HAVE $50,000.

00:47.067 --> 00:49.233
IVAN'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO COULD POSSIB--

00:49.267 --> 00:50.900
IVAN IS NOT
A GOOD IDEA.

00:50.933 --> 00:52.767
[KIT]: NOT YET.

00:52.800 --> 00:55.033
IVAN, I GOT HERE
A LITTLE EARLY.

00:55.900 --> 00:58.033
I DIDN'T
SEE ANYTHING!

00:58.067 --> 01:00.367
YOU DON'T THINK
YOU COULD'VE CHANGED YOUR PLAN

01:00.400 --> 01:02.133
A LITTLE BIT?
I DON'T HAVE A PLAN.

01:02.167 --> 01:03.067
THAT'S THE POINT.

01:03.067 --> 01:04.067
DOES THAT FEEL GOOD?

01:04.067 --> 01:05.733
THAT FEELS REALLY GOOD.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.600
TIM...

01:08.633 --> 01:09.733
[WHIMPERING]:
DON'T LEAVE.

01:30.067 --> 01:32.100
WHERE'S CLAYBOURNE?

01:39.400 --> 01:41.067
OH, CLAYBOURNE.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.067
CLAYBOURNE.

01:43.100 --> 01:45.167

02:53.767 --> 02:55.100
IT WAS BETTE'S HOUSE.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.700
SHE BOUGHT IT
BEFORE WE MET,

02:56.733 --> 02:58.833
BUT SHE PUT ME
ON THE TITLE

02:58.867 --> 03:00.100
AFTER I MOVED IN.

03:00.133 --> 03:01.133
DID YOU CONTRIBUTE

03:01.167 --> 03:02.567
TO THE MORTGAGE
PAYMENTS?

03:02.600 --> 03:03.667
I OFFERED,

03:03.700 --> 03:06.133
BUT BETTE NEVER
WANTED ME TO.

03:06.167 --> 03:07.433
I MADE
PRETTY GOOD MONEY

03:07.467 --> 03:08.833
AS A DEVELOPMENT
EXECUTIVE,

03:08.867 --> 03:10.100
BUT NOT AS MUCH AS BETTE,

03:10.133 --> 03:11.967
AND SHE INSISTED
ON PAYING THE MORTGAGE.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.067
AND YOU ALWAYS DID
WHAT BETTE WANTED?

03:14.067 --> 03:15.600
NO.

03:15.633 --> 03:17.200
DID YOU PAY
FOR ANYTHING?

03:21.200 --> 03:22.300
I...

03:22.333 --> 03:24.833
PAID FOR UTILITIES,
AND I...

03:26.067 --> 03:28.567
PAID FOR THE FOOD,

03:28.600 --> 03:31.133
ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE UTILITIES
ARE IN BETTE'S NAME.

03:31.167 --> 03:32.600
OF COURSE THEY ARE.

03:32.633 --> 03:33.633
THAT'S THE WAY SHE WANTED IT.

03:33.667 --> 03:36.233
WHY SHOULD THE LITTLE WIFE

03:36.267 --> 03:37.733
HAVE TO PUT HER NAME
ON ANYTHING?

03:37.767 --> 03:39.600
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE.

03:39.633 --> 03:41.300
[BALL BOUNCES ON FLOOR]

03:41.333 --> 03:44.467
I JUST NEVER BOTHERED
TO CHANGE IT.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.100
LOOK, I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHY I'M HERE.

03:46.133 --> 03:48.633
I'M NOT GOING AFTER
BETTE'S MONEY.

03:48.667 --> 03:49.900
IF WE WIND UP IN COURT--

03:49.933 --> 03:51.267
WIND UP IN COURT! I--

03:51.300 --> 03:52.267
WHOA.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.533
I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.700
SHE HAD TO DO SOMETHING,
SO I HOOKED HER UP.

04:04.733 --> 04:06.067
WITH A LAWYER?

04:06.067 --> 04:07.400
JOYCE WISCHNIA
IS THE LEADING

04:07.433 --> 04:09.233

IN L.A.

04:09.267 --> 04:12.300
JESUS, AL, YOU AND YOUR
FUCKING "BEST OF" LISTS.

04:12.333 --> 04:13.933
BETTE AND TINA
DON'T NEED THAT.

04:13.967 --> 04:16.200
WELL, I WASN'T REALLY
THINKING ABOUT BETTE.

04:16.233 --> 04:18.067
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT TINA.

04:18.067 --> 04:19.467
FINE.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.067
WHAT DO YOU THINK
SHE NEEDS?

04:21.067 --> 04:22.667
I DON'T KNOW.

04:22.700 --> 04:24.733
A LAP DANCE, MAYBE.

04:24.767 --> 04:26.167
NOT A FUCKING LAWYER.

04:27.233 --> 04:28.367
CLOSED?

04:29.933 --> 04:31.867
WHAT?

04:33.767 --> 04:36.133
SHIT.

04:36.167 --> 04:38.367
DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU
WHY YOU NEED A LAWYER?

04:38.400 --> 04:39.600
OKAY.

04:39.633 --> 04:41.433
BECAUSE IN THE EYES
OF THE WORLD,

04:41.467 --> 04:45.367
ESPECIALLY THE WORLD
AS EMBODIED BY THE COURTS,

04:45.400 --> 04:46.767
YOU ARE SHIT.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.167
YOU GAVE UP
YOUR AUTONOMY

04:49.200 --> 04:50.500
IN A RELATIONSHIP

04:50.533 --> 04:52.967
THAT THE LAW DOESN'T RECOGNIZE,

04:53.067 --> 04:55.533
AND YOUR EX CONTROLS EVERYTHING.

04:55.567 --> 04:57.800
SHE ALWAYS SAID
WHAT'S HERS IS MINE.

04:57.833 --> 04:59.733
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHOSE NAME IT WAS IN.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.833
IF I NEEDED MONEY
IN MY CHECKING ACCOUNT,

05:01.867 --> 05:03.067
I JUST TOOK IT
FROM SAVINGS.

05:03.067 --> 05:05.133
I WAS AUTHORIZED ON THE ACCOUNT.

05:05.167 --> 05:07.733
I NEVER HAD TO ASK HER
FOR ANYTHING.

05:07.767 --> 05:09.600
DOES IT BOTHER YOU IF I SMOKE?

05:09.633 --> 05:12.500
I REALLY WISH
THAT YOU WOULDN'T.

05:12.533 --> 05:14.567
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

05:19.867 --> 05:22.367
OKAY.

05:24.267 --> 05:26.200
OKAY.

05:27.900 --> 05:30.067
LET'S REVIEW THE FACTS.

05:31.733 --> 05:34.067
DID YOU GIVE UP YOUR CAREER
AT HER URGING?

05:34.100 --> 05:36.233
YES.

05:36.267 --> 05:38.233
DID YOU MAKE A HOME FOR HER,
DID YOU COOK,

05:38.267 --> 05:39.367
DECORATE, ENTERTAIN,

05:39.400 --> 05:41.067
FILL THE HOUSE
WITH LIVELINESS

05:41.067 --> 05:42.333
AND WARMTH?

05:44.167 --> 05:46.067
YES.

05:46.067 --> 05:47.567
OKAY.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.867
DID YOU OFFER YOUR WOMB
TO GIVE BIRTH TO HER CHILD?

05:58.867 --> 06:01.667
BETTE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS.

06:01.700 --> 06:03.900
NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT THIS.

06:03.933 --> 06:05.233
YOU'RE KIDDING.

06:05.267 --> 06:07.067
I JUST STARTED
SHOWING.

06:07.100 --> 06:10.067
I HAD A MISCARRIAGE
ABOUT FIVE MONTHS AGO.

06:10.100 --> 06:12.067
BETTE DIDN'T HANDLE IT SO WELL.

06:12.100 --> 06:14.300
I DIDN'T WANT HER
TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH IT AGAIN.

06:14.333 --> 06:16.467
SO YOU WENT
AND GOT INSEMINATED ON YOUR OWN,

06:16.500 --> 06:18.433
AND YOU'RE PROTECTING HER

06:18.467 --> 06:20.833
UNTIL YOU'RE SURE
IT'S GOING TO STICK?

06:20.867 --> 06:22.567
YEAH.

06:22.600 --> 06:23.867
AND THEN SHE CHEATED ON YOU.

06:23.900 --> 06:25.467
SHE SPREAD HER LEGS
FOR ANOTHER WOMAN.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.900
COULD YOU PLEASE NOT SAY THAT?

06:26.933 --> 06:27.900
IT'S TRUE!

06:27.933 --> 06:28.967
DEAL WITH IT.

06:29.067 --> 06:30.067
DOESN'T IT MAKE YOU ANGRY?

06:30.100 --> 06:31.300
FUCK, YES.

06:31.333 --> 06:32.633
SO WHAT
DO YOU WANT?

06:32.667 --> 06:34.367
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR YOURSELF.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.800
GET WHAT YOU RIGHTFULLY DESERVE,

06:35.833 --> 06:38.233
AND DON'T LET BETTE
DECIDE THAT FOR YOU.

06:38.267 --> 06:39.700
LOOK, TINA.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.967
I AM NOT A MARRIAGE WRECKER.

06:42.067 --> 06:44.267
IF YOU WANT
TO GET BACK TOGETHER

06:44.300 --> 06:45.300
WITH BETTE...

06:45.333 --> 06:46.900
DO YOU?

06:48.600 --> 06:50.433
I DON'T KNOW.

06:50.467 --> 06:52.300
WELL, EITHER WAY,

06:52.333 --> 06:54.967
YOU HAVE TO COME AT THIS
FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH.

06:55.067 --> 06:56.200
WHETHER OR NOT

06:56.233 --> 06:58.433
YOU AND BETTE
EVENTUALLY RECONCILE--

06:58.467 --> 07:00.100
ESPECIALLY IF YOU DECIDE
TO GET BACK TOGETHER

07:00.133 --> 07:02.900
AND REBUILD TRUST
IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP,

07:02.933 --> 07:05.467
FIRST YOU NEED
TO HAVE YOUR AUTONOMY.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.067
CAN YOU SEE WHY?

07:07.100 --> 07:09.600
YES, I CAN SEE WHY.

07:09.633 --> 07:11.733
I WANT MY AUTONOMY.

07:11.767 --> 07:13.700
OKAY.

07:15.767 --> 07:17.833
WHO IS BETTE'S LAWYER?

07:19.433 --> 07:20.867
THE--THE--THE--THE--

07:20.900 --> 07:23.100
THE SOMALIAN HEAD TRIP,
THE ESPRESSO OF THE DAY,

07:23.133 --> 07:25.533
IS THAT DIFFERENT
THAN A REGULAR SHOT?

07:25.567 --> 07:26.933
NO.

07:26.967 --> 07:27.967
IT'S NOT?
NO.

07:28.067 --> 07:29.133
OKAY, WELL, THEN,

07:29.167 --> 07:31.300
CAN I HAVE TWO,
OF WHICHEVER'S STRONGEST--

07:31.333 --> 07:32.633
OKAY.
OKAY?

07:32.667 --> 07:34.633
AND CAN I HAVE IT
FILLED IN A TALL CUP,

07:34.667 --> 07:35.633
HALF WAY?

07:35.667 --> 07:37.667
OKAY. ANY FLAVORING?

07:37.700 --> 07:40.367
WHAT, IN MY COFFEE?

07:40.400 --> 07:42.200
WHAT THE FUCK
IS HE TALKING ABOUT,

07:42.233 --> 07:43.200
WITH THE FLAVORING?

07:43.233 --> 07:44.200
HEY.

07:44.233 --> 07:45.433
GUYS.

07:45.467 --> 07:46.600
SORRY. CAN YOU--

07:46.633 --> 07:47.767
EXCUSE US.
SORRY. EXCUSE ME.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.133
SHANE DOES NOT KNOW
WHAT SHE'S DOING HERE.

07:50.167 --> 07:51.433
WHAT DO YOU NORMALLY
HAVE AT THE PLANET?

07:51.467 --> 07:52.900
A DOUBLE SHOT.

07:52.933 --> 07:54.567
GIVE THE WOMAN
A BABY MIND BLOWER

07:54.600 --> 07:55.967
WITH AN EXTRA HIT
OF ESPRESSO.

07:56.067 --> 07:57.667
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
THE EXTRA HIT, SHANE.

07:57.700 --> 07:58.667
I MEAN, EVEN THOUGH
THEY CALL IT

07:58.700 --> 07:59.700
"THE MIND BLOWER,"

07:59.733 --> 08:01.133
IT'S STILL NOT AS STRONG
AS PLANET COFFEE.

08:01.167 --> 08:02.467
AND WE WILL EACH HAVE

08:02.500 --> 08:04.100
A TOFFEE NUT
CARAMEL SOY

08:04.133 --> 08:06.100
FAR OUT FRAPPE.

08:06.133 --> 08:08.267
YOU DON'T MIND, RIGHT,
SINCE WE'RE HERE?

08:08.300 --> 08:09.700
TOFFEE NUT SOY...

08:09.733 --> 08:11.833
FAR OUT FRAPPE.

08:11.867 --> 08:13.267
FAR OUT FRAPPE...
THAT'S...

08:13.300 --> 08:14.800
THAT'S INTENSE,
TONYA.

08:14.833 --> 08:16.167
IT'S WHAT
I'M IN THE MOOD FOR.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.167
DANA DIDN'T
REALLY SAY

08:17.200 --> 08:19.100
THAT SHE WAS IN THE MOOD
FOR ONE, THOUGH.

08:19.133 --> 08:20.467
NO, BUT SHE LIKES WHAT I LIKE.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.867
SHE ALWAYS WANTS
WHAT I WANT

08:21.900 --> 08:23.167
MORE THAN
WHAT SHE WANTS. RIGHT?

08:23.200 --> 08:25.967
IT'S TRUE. I DO.

08:26.067 --> 08:26.967
THAT'S SO NICE.

08:28.700 --> 08:30.200
SO LESBIAN.

08:45.167 --> 08:47.633
IVAN'S NOT
CALLING ME BACK.

08:47.667 --> 08:52.067
IVAN DOESN'T WANNA TALK.

08:52.100 --> 08:54.233
JUST TELL ME
WHERE SH--HE IS.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.567
I'VE BEEN
TO THE APARTMENT.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.967
HE'S NOT THERE.

08:58.067 --> 09:00.833
HE'S GOT A CABIN IN IDYLLWILD.

09:00.867 --> 09:03.067
HE'S GOT A CABIN?

09:03.067 --> 09:04.067
YEAH.

09:05.567 --> 09:07.600
IVAN'S GOT A CABIN.

09:07.633 --> 09:10.100
YEAH.
DUDE'S SET UP.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.300
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I APPRECIATE

09:12.333 --> 09:13.367
YOU BEING PROTECTIVE,

09:13.400 --> 09:15.267
BUT IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.267
I REALLY CARE
FOR IVAN.

09:17.300 --> 09:19.200
SURE.

09:19.233 --> 09:21.833
I NEED
TO TALK TO HIM.

09:21.867 --> 09:24.067
WHAT HAPPENED,
YOU KNOW,

09:24.100 --> 09:25.833
WITH THE TWO OF YOU?

09:25.867 --> 09:27.533
WHEN I SAW HER?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.600
WHEN YOU
SAW HER, YEAH.

09:29.633 --> 09:31.533
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T
HAVE BUSTED IN.

09:31.567 --> 09:33.533
I SHOULD HAVE WAITED.

09:33.567 --> 09:35.300
IT WAS BAD.

09:35.333 --> 09:38.067
I KNOW IT WAS BAD
FOR IVAN,

09:38.067 --> 09:39.700
BUT IT WAS UNSETTLING
FOR ME, TOO,

09:39.733 --> 09:41.433
YOU KNOW, BUT WE CAN
GET PAST THAT.

09:41.467 --> 09:42.867

20:33.167 --> 20:35.433
THANKS FOR TRYING,
PEOPLE.

20:35.467 --> 20:39.600
YOU'LL ALL HEAR FROM ME
WITHIN THE NEXT 10 DAYS.

20:54.367 --> 20:56.867
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?

20:56.900 --> 20:59.033
BECAUSE WE WANT THEM
TO TAKE PART IN THE WEDDING.

20:59.067 --> 21:00.400
WE WANT THEM
IN THE WEDDING PHOTOS.

21:00.433 --> 21:02.300
WE WANT YOUR FATHER
TO GIVE YOU AWAY.

21:02.333 --> 21:03.867
YEAH. GIVE ME AWAY.

21:03.900 --> 21:05.867
THEY'RE PROBABLY
GOING TO DISOWN ME.

21:05.900 --> 21:07.900
HONEY, THEY KNOW WE'RE
GETTING MARRIED, DON'T THEY?

21:07.933 --> 21:08.900
YES.

21:08.933 --> 21:09.933
AND THEY HAVEN'T
DISOWNED US YET,

[SIGHING]

21:14.967 --> 21:19.233
POOKIE,
THE WORST THEY CAN DO...

21:19.267 --> 21:23.067
IS REFUSE
TO ACKNOWLEDGE US.

21:23.067 --> 21:24.067
WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH

21:24.067 --> 21:25.067
WHAT THEY'RE DOING
ALREADY, RIGHT?

21:25.100 --> 21:26.367
MM.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.600
I NEED YOU
TO GO GET READY.

21:28.633 --> 21:29.867
OKAY.

21:29.900 --> 21:32.967
I NEED YOU TO WEAR YOUR HAIR
IN A PONYTAIL,

21:33.067 --> 21:35.167
AND LET ME TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING ELSE.

21:35.200 --> 21:36.900
OKAY?

21:36.933 --> 21:38.600
OKAY.

YOUR SHIT'S EVERYWHERE.

21:54.067 --> 21:55.500
[KNOCKING CONTINUES]

22:00.633 --> 22:03.100

IS TINA?

22:03.133 --> 22:04.400
BETTE.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.067
SHE'S NOT HERE,

22:08.067 --> 22:10.167
BUT YOU'RE WELCOME
TO COME IN.

22:10.200 --> 22:11.767
SHE'S AT WORK.

22:11.800 --> 22:14.100
SHE AND OSCAR
ARE INTO SOME BIG PROJECT.

22:14.133 --> 22:16.200
DID YOU KNOW
SHE'S HIRING A LAWYER?

22:16.233 --> 22:17.933
SHE'S NOT HIRING ONE.

22:17.967 --> 22:19.600
SHE JUST WENT
FOR A CONSULTATION.

22:19.633 --> 22:21.533
OH! PROVIDE BANK STATEMENTS.

22:21.567 --> 22:23.333
HAVE THE HOUSE REAPPRAISED.

22:23.367 --> 22:24.833
SUPPLY A LIST OF MY ASSETS.

22:24.867 --> 22:26.133
DOES THAT SOUND
LIKE A CONSULTATION?

22:26.167 --> 22:27.800
SHE WAS JUST
GOING TO GET SOME ADVICE.

22:27.833 --> 22:29.067
I THOUGHT SHE NEEDED IT.

22:29.100 --> 22:31.433
YOU KNOW, TO FEEL LIKE
SHE HAD SOME OPTIONS.

22:31.467 --> 22:33.100
YOU THOUGHT?

22:33.133 --> 22:34.100
BETTE, YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:34.133 --> 22:35.433
SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

22:35.467 --> 22:37.733
SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING
OF HER OWN ANYMORE.

22:37.767 --> 22:39.767
SO YOU SENT HER
TO FUCKING JOYCE WISCHNIA?

22:39.800 --> 22:41.700
I JUST SUGGESTED
SHE SEE A LAWYER.

22:41.733 --> 22:42.567
FUCK YOU.

22:42.600 --> 22:43.400

22:46.233 --> 22:47.633
YOU KNOW, I'M STILL YOUR FRIEND.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.400
I'M TOTALLY YOUR FRIEND,
BUT YOU CAN BE A LITTLE CRUEL.

22:50.733 --> 22:52.367
I'VE BEEN THERE. I REMEMBER.

22:54.367 --> 22:55.967
THAT'S LOW.

22:57.800 --> 22:59.767
YOU AND I DATED FOR SIX WEEKS.

22:59.800 --> 23:00.933
IT WAS NEVER
GOING TO GO ANYWHERE.

23:00.967 --> 23:02.700
I DID US BOTH A FAVOR.

23:04.667 --> 23:07.433
IT'S JUST...TINA'S HURTING.

23:10.433 --> 23:12.733
AND I WOULD KIND OF LIKE
MY PLACE BACK SOMEDAY.

23:14.900 --> 23:17.500
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT...
MY FRIEND.

23:17.533 --> 23:18.967
YOU CAN JUDGE ME
ALL YOU WANT TO.

23:19.067 --> 23:20.300
YOU CAN MAKE ME
INTO A PARIAH.

WITH MY LIFE LIKE THAT, OKAY?

23:24.633 --> 23:25.733
DON'T CROSS THAT LINE AGAIN.

23:25.767 --> 23:28.067
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO CROSS A LINE.

23:28.067 --> 23:30.067
I--I'M SORRY!

23:32.567 --> 23:34.367
TO SPONSORSHIP.

23:51.067 --> 23:52.067
WHO LOCKED IN
THE GM DEAL.

23:52.067 --> 23:54.100
THAT'S JUST
THE BEGINNING.

23:54.133 --> 23:56.067
SHARON, IRWIN,
DO YOU REALIZE

23:56.100 --> 23:58.333
WHAT AN IMPACT
DANA CAN HAVE?

23:58.367 --> 23:59.467
BECAUSE,
SHE'S, WELL,

23:59.500 --> 24:01.933
BECAUSE
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

24:01.967 --> 24:04.300
BECAUSE SHE LOOKS LIKE

24:04.333 --> 24:06.067
THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL NEXT DOOR.

24:06.100 --> 24:08.333

DANA'S PRETTY NEAR PERFECT.

HAVE SOMETHING

24:27.300 --> 24:28.767

24:28.800 --> 24:29.767
NO, I'M SORRY,

24:29.800 --> 24:30.933
YOU CANNOT HAVE
THE TIFFANY LAMPS

ARE READY TO DOWNSIZE.

24:44.533 --> 24:45.600
WHAT DIFFERENCE
THAT MAKES.

24:59.133 --> 25:01.100
I MEAN, LOOK AT YOU TWO.

25:01.133 --> 25:03.833
BOTH OF YOU, SUCH PRETTY GIRLS.

25:03.867 --> 25:07.300

HAVE ANY TROUBLE FINDING A MAN.

TO FIND A MAN, MOM.

AND YOU JUST DON'T LISTEN.

25:17.800 --> 25:18.733
IT'S OKAY.

25:22.300 --> 25:25.600
SHARON, I WAS ENGAGED
ONCE BEFORE.

25:25.633 --> 25:27.500
I DON'T KNOW
IF DANA TOLD YOU.

25:27.533 --> 25:30.300
NO. NO, SHE DIDN'T.

25:30.333 --> 25:32.200
WELL...

25:32.233 --> 25:34.200
HIS NAME WAS BAYARD.

25:34.233 --> 25:36.800
HE WAS SMART
AND SUCCESSFUL.

25:36.833 --> 25:38.967
HE WAS
A REAL ESTATE LAWYER.

25:39.067 --> 25:42.300
HE WAS TOTALLY
IN LOVE WITH ME.

25:42.333 --> 25:43.333
NOW, I TRIED
REALLY HARD

25:43.367 --> 25:44.833
TO MAKE
THAT ONE WORK,

25:44.867 --> 25:46.067
BUT EVERY NIGHT,

25:46.067 --> 25:47.667
I WOULD WAKE UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

25:47.700 --> 25:48.833
CRYING.

25:48.867 --> 25:51.433
AND ONE NIGHT,
BAYARD WOKE UP

25:51.467 --> 25:52.900
AND HE FOUND ME
LIKE THAT.

25:54.133 --> 25:55.767
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID?

25:55.800 --> 25:57.167
DAMNED IF I DO.

25:57.200 --> 26:01.067
HE GOT DOWN
ON ONE KNEE,

26:01.067 --> 26:04.367
AND HE SAID,

26:04.400 --> 26:08.500
"TONYA...
WILL YOU NOT MARRY ME?"

26:12.933 --> 26:17.133
"BECAUSE I KNOW
WHAT'S IN YOUR HEART,

26:17.167 --> 26:21.433
AND I LOVE YOU TOO MUCH
TO MAKE YOU UNHAPPY."

26:25.967 --> 26:28.067
"BE TRUE TO YOURSELF, TONYA."

"FOLLOW YOUR HEART."

KEEL OVER AND DIE.

JOYCE WISCHNIA.

27:40.733 --> 27:41.700

27:41.733 --> 27:43.367
DON'T GET ME
INVOLVED IN THAT.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.433
BETTE TOTALLY
REAMS ME

27:45.467 --> 27:48.067
FOR SUGGESTING
TINA SEE A LAWYER.

27:48.067 --> 27:50.200
WELL, I CAN'T
BLAME HER.

27:50.233 --> 27:52.333
SORRY, TINA.

27:52.367 --> 27:55.100
I'VE BEEN TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE
MY WHOLE LIFE.

27:55.133 --> 27:57.667
IT'S ABOUT TIME I STARTED
TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

27:57.700 --> 27:58.833
THAT'S WHY I NEED A LAWYER.

27:58.867 --> 28:01.833
YEAH, BUT...
POOR BETTE.

28:01.867 --> 28:04.500
WELL, SHE'S NOT EXACTLY
THE INNOCENT PARTY.

28:04.533 --> 28:05.833
YEAH, I KNOW,

28:05.867 --> 28:07.767
BUT, YOU KNOW,
GETTING A LAWYER

28:07.800 --> 28:08.800
MEANS THAT THINGS
WILL GET UGLY.

28:08.833 --> 28:10.100
COULDN'T YOU
JUST TRY

28:10.133 --> 28:12.200
TO WORK IT OUT
TOGETHER?

28:12.233 --> 28:14.433
BETTE AND I NEED TO BE
ON EQUAL FOOTING

28:14.467 --> 28:18.167
BEFORE THERE'S ANY CHANCE
THAT WE COULD WORK ANYTHING OUT.

28:18.200 --> 28:20.800
I NEED MY AUTONOMY.

28:25.733 --> 28:27.533
I DON'T THINK

28:27.567 --> 28:29.067
THAT I WROTE VERY WELL
YESTERDAY,

28:29.067 --> 28:32.100
AND I THINK
THAT MADAME BIRCH

28:32.133 --> 28:34.267
DIDN'T
REALLY LIKE ME.

28:34.300 --> 28:36.967

PROBABLY JEALOUS

28:37.067 --> 28:38.267
BECAUSE
YOU'RE SO GIFTED

28:56.900 --> 28:59.233

28:59.267 --> 29:01.467
HER MOM CLAUDIA
IS THE GRAPHIC DESIGNER,

29:01.500 --> 29:02.933
AND HER OTHER MOTHER
MARGARET

29:02.967 --> 29:05.067
IS THE GERIATRIC NURSE.
RIGHT.

29:05.067 --> 29:06.067

MM...YEAH.

29:19.300 --> 29:21.067
UM, YEAH,
MOST OF MY FRIENDS

29:21.067 --> 29:22.400

29:22.433 --> 29:24.633
THEY SORT OF, UM,
TOOK CARE OF ME

29:24.667 --> 29:25.667
AFTER, YOU KNOW,

29:25.700 --> 29:27.067
CLAYBOURNE AND I
BROKE UP.

29:27.067 --> 29:31.067
THEY WERE REALLY HAPPY
WHEN I MET YOU.

29:35.767 --> 29:36.800
DOES SHE KNOW

29:36.833 --> 29:39.733
THAT WE'RE HAVING
COFFEE?

29:39.767 --> 29:42.067
UH, SHE'S IN
NEWPORT BEACH

29:42.100 --> 29:43.400
WITH HER FAMILY.

29:43.433 --> 29:45.400
MM.

29:45.433 --> 29:47.333
NO, SHE DOESN'T
KNOW,

29:47.367 --> 29:50.300
BUT I'M NOT
HIDING IT.

29:52.133 --> 29:54.300
WELL, IF SHE'S
AT THE BEACH,

29:54.333 --> 29:56.167
WE COULD'VE JUST
MET AT YOUR PLACE,

29:56.200 --> 29:57.967
LIKE THE GOOD OLD DAYS.

29:58.067 --> 30:00.100
BUT WE HAVE RULES

30:00.133 --> 30:02.233
AND WE'RE TRYING
TO FOLLOW THEM.

30:04.467 --> 30:05.700
DOES THAT MEAN

30:05.733 --> 30:10.600
THAT YOU'RE FINDING IT
DIFFICULT?

30:10.633 --> 30:12.133
NO.

30:12.167 --> 30:13.500
NO, NOT AT ALL.

30:13.533 --> 30:14.967

30:36.900 --> 30:38.733
OH, SHE JUST SAID
HER FIRST WORD.

30:38.767 --> 30:40.767
SAY YOUR WORD.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.267
DO YOU WANT TO
HAVE CHILDREN, JENNY?

30:43.300 --> 30:45.933
OH, GOSH, I--I--I DON'T KNOW.

30:45.967 --> 30:47.800
I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW?

30:47.833 --> 30:49.067
I JUST KIND OF FEEL LIKE

30:49.100 --> 30:50.900
