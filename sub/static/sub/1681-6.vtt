00:02.500 --> 00:04.301
Kids, the day you get married is supposed

00:04.301 --> 00:06.104
To bethe happiest day of your life,

00:06.204 --> 00:08.907
The perfect ending to a perfect love story.

00:09.106 --> 00:11.509
My wedding-- at least my first wedding--

00:11.509 --> 00:13.011
Didn't go so well.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.074

00:26.826 --> 00:28.928
It's funny looking back on it now.

00:29.329 --> 00:31.931
I was so sure stella was the one.

00:32.231 --> 00:35.034
And when she left me, I was so devastated.

00:35.534 --> 00:37.237
But you guys got me through it.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.639
And now the painful part's over.

00:39.739 --> 00:42.543
I've come out the other side a little bit stronger.

00:43.243 --> 00:46.246
You know, i... I hardly even think about her anymore.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.849
That's what time does, I guess.

00:52.053 --> 00:54.155
Ted, the wedding was yesterday.

00:54.955 --> 00:56.657
It's been 24 hours.

00:56.657 --> 00:57.859
I know.

00:57.959 --> 01:00.061
And this is me, moving on.

01:00.061 --> 01:01.262
A great new chapter

01:01.262 --> 01:02.664
Of my life began today,

01:02.664 --> 01:03.765
And we're gonna celebrate.

01:03.765 --> 01:05.266
Right now, we need two things.

01:05.266 --> 01:08.470
We need kool, and we need the gang.

01:08.470 --> 01:10.371
It's jukebox time, huh?

01:14.676 --> 01:16.077
I look at that young man

01:16.077 --> 01:19.281
Popping and locking his way over to the jukebox,

01:19.582 --> 01:20.683
And I think to myself,

01:20.683 --> 01:21.784
You know...

01:22.484 --> 01:24.387
Maybe stella made the right call.

01:24.987 --> 01:26.389
Ow, pain.

01:26.389 --> 01:27.991
How is he dancing right now?

01:27.991 --> 01:29.391
He should... he should be smashing up

01:29.391 --> 01:31.494
Stella's car with a sledgehammer.

01:32.094 --> 01:33.296
Hypothetical.

01:33.596 --> 01:35.798
Ted isn't pretending to be happy.

01:35.798 --> 01:37.400
Ted really is happy.

01:37.400 --> 01:38.401
He never wanted to get married

01:38.401 --> 01:39.302
In the first place.

01:39.302 --> 01:40.704
Ted just pulled off

01:40.704 --> 01:43.806
The greatest train dodge since stand by me.

01:44.007 --> 01:47.310
Well, not the first kid, but the other kids.

01:47.611 --> 01:50.814
No, he is in bad shape.

01:51.114 --> 01:52.215
What's up?

01:53.417 --> 01:55.419
Really bad shape.

01:55.619 --> 01:57.822
And we need to be there for him.

01:58.121 --> 02:00.825
But as much as my friend really want to be there for me,

02:00.825 --> 02:02.726
I was...by all the appearances...

02:02.726 --> 02:03.728
Fine.

02:03.828 --> 02:04.729
Hey,buddy

02:04.829 --> 02:05.930
Want to hang out?

02:05.930 --> 02:08.532
Guys, I'm fine.

02:10.033 --> 02:11.836
Hey, pal, you want to have a catch?

02:12.037 --> 02:13.238
I'm fine.

02:16.942 --> 02:18.743
Hey, kiddo.

02:19.144 --> 02:20.745
Barney, I'm fine.

02:20.745 --> 02:21.947
This is not necessary,

02:21.947 --> 02:24.349
And it's actually kind of weird.

02:24.349 --> 02:25.851
No offense, ladies.

02:26.151 --> 02:28.354
I did not realize you'd be home.

02:29.254 --> 02:31.057
Ladies, to the stairwell.

02:45.071 --> 02:46.473
Finally, after two weeks,

02:46.473 --> 02:48.475
The inevitable emotions boiled over.

02:48.475 --> 02:50.177
Hey, you guys want to get some dinner?

02:50.177 --> 02:51.378
Oh, shut up.

02:52.179 --> 02:53.580
I'm sorry, sweetie.

02:53.580 --> 02:54.782
It's just, ted,

02:54.782 --> 02:56.984
You've been through something traumatic,

02:56.984 --> 02:58.586
And we're trying to be there for you

02:58.586 --> 03:00.387
As friends, but you're not letting us,

03:00.387 --> 03:03.491
And it's pissing us off, you selfish bitch.

03:03.791 --> 03:04.792
Sorry.

03:04.992 --> 03:05.894
Look, we're just worried

03:05.894 --> 03:07.895
That you're not dealing with this whole stella thing.

03:07.895 --> 03:09.797
Do you remember when lily left me?

03:09.797 --> 03:12.199
You remember how I held in my feelings?

03:12.300 --> 03:17.305
I... Miss... Her so much.

03:18.707 --> 03:20.608
Yeah, dude, you were a rock.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.911
Well, I should have been even worse, okay?

03:22.911 --> 03:24.013
I should have gotten mad.

03:24.013 --> 03:25.014
I should have taken your advice

03:25.014 --> 03:26.715
And set all of lily's stuff on fire.

03:26.715 --> 03:28.817
Oh, nice-- thanks, ted.

03:28.817 --> 03:30.419
But I didn't, and I think that that's why

03:30.419 --> 03:31.821
It took me so long to get better.

03:31.821 --> 03:33.022
So, now, ted...

03:33.822 --> 03:35.525
I want you to explode.

03:35.725 --> 03:37.127
Release the berserker.

03:37.127 --> 03:38.928
Okay, ready?

03:40.730 --> 03:41.831
Now!

03:42.532 --> 03:43.232
I'm good.

03:43.232 --> 03:44.334
No.

03:44.534 --> 03:45.935
Guys, get off his back.

03:46.035 --> 03:47.036
He's happy.

03:47.036 --> 03:49.039
Listen, if ted were married right now,

03:49.039 --> 03:50.640
He'd be married,

03:50.640 --> 03:52.543
He'd be living in new jersey,

03:52.543 --> 03:55.445
And he'd be married.

03:55.646 --> 03:57.547
He's fine. Now, let's eat.

03:57.647 --> 03:58.748
How about flat michael's?

03:58.748 --> 04:00.451
No, that's 44th and lex. Can't do it.

04:00.551 --> 04:02.352
Why not? It's too close to stella's gym.

04:02.352 --> 04:04.355
Might run into her. Anywhere else, though.

04:04.555 --> 04:06.758
Okay, um, how about hurley's?

04:07.157 --> 04:09.560
Right between stella's office and her dry cleaners.

04:09.560 --> 04:10.861
No, sir.

04:10.861 --> 04:12.964
Well, what about meatloaf charlie's?

04:12.964 --> 04:15.166
Two blocks from stella's mother's hairdressers.

04:15.367 --> 04:16.968
Well, geez, ted, is there anywhere

04:16.968 --> 04:19.070
In manhattan we can go to dinner?

04:19.471 --> 04:20.772
Of course.

04:20.772 --> 04:22.174
Check this out.

04:24.176 --> 04:25.477
What you got there, ted?

04:25.477 --> 04:27.479
A little reference map I made for myself.

04:27.479 --> 04:30.783
A new york guide to places you might run into stella zinman.

04:30.783 --> 04:31.584
Red areas

04:31.584 --> 04:32.584
Are places to avoid.

04:32.584 --> 04:33.986
White areas are safe.

04:33.986 --> 04:35.288
Blue is water.

04:35.288 --> 04:36.890
That is just ridiculous.

04:36.890 --> 04:38.691
Well, water is blue.

04:38.691 --> 04:40.393
You can't live that way.

04:40.493 --> 04:41.794
She leaves you at the altar,

04:41.794 --> 04:43.095
And you're the one avoiding her?

04:43.095 --> 04:44.797
Yes, I'm avoiding her.

04:44.797 --> 04:45.798
What's the big deal?

04:45.798 --> 04:46.699
That's how we do it.

04:46.699 --> 04:48.101
Who's we, gutless weenies?

04:48.101 --> 04:52.406
Uh, no, "we" is people from the great state of ohio.

04:52.605 --> 04:53.907
When life gives us pain,

04:53.907 --> 04:57.111
We buckeyes take that pain and we push it down.

04:57.510 --> 04:58.412
And if the pain starts

04:58.412 --> 04:59.213
To come up again,

04:59.213 --> 05:01.515
We push more pain down on top of it.

05:01.515 --> 05:03.918
Why confront something when you can avoid it, right?

05:03.918 --> 05:04.818
All I have to do

05:04.818 --> 05:06.120
Is never see stella again,

05:06.120 --> 05:07.922
And I'll live a long, happy life.

05:08.723 --> 05:10.124
Now, who wants to get something to eat?

05:10.124 --> 05:11.326
Oh, somebody just told me

05:11.326 --> 05:13.728
About a tapas place that's in the white zone.

05:13.728 --> 05:15.130
Great. Let's go there.

05:17.031 --> 05:18.132
You ready to order?

05:18.132 --> 05:19.234
Uh, not quite yet.

05:19.234 --> 05:21.336
Oh, can we get some of those almonds for the table?

05:21.336 --> 05:22.337
Certainly.

05:23.138 --> 05:24.439
Nice call, lily.

05:24.439 --> 05:25.741
This place looks great.

05:25.741 --> 05:26.942
Who told you about it?

05:26.942 --> 05:28.643
You know, I don't remember.

05:31.647 --> 05:32.648
What?

05:32.848 --> 05:34.449
i just remembered...

05:43.959 --> 05:45.661
Oh, my god, oh, my god.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.663
Okay, okay, just be cool.

05:47.663 --> 05:49.365
We're just gonna have to deal with this.

05:49.466 --> 05:52.569
Everyone... Follow my lead.

05:55.071 --> 05:57.074
Oh, you're kidding. Is he serious?

05:57.074 --> 05:58.875
I am not getting under thisable.

05:59.576 --> 06:01.779
I'd maybe get under that table.

06:02.579 --> 06:03.781
She's turning around.

06:09.687 --> 06:11.189
Think, think, think.

06:11.488 --> 06:12.590
Everyone, just stay here.

06:12.590 --> 06:13.891
I'm gonna go take a look.

06:14.592 --> 06:15.994
Marshall, go take a look.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.102
And will you need utensils?

06:24.202 --> 06:25.904
No, I'm just going straight home.

06:28.406 --> 06:30.108
She's placing an order to go.

06:30.108 --> 06:32.511
Did she seem happy? Did she say anything about me?

06:32.912 --> 06:34.013
I don't even care.

06:34.013 --> 06:35.314
Where are those almonds?

06:35.314 --> 06:36.915
Gosh, where would ted's nuts be?

06:36.915 --> 06:39.819
Hey, why don't you check the vise in stella's garage.

06:40.419 --> 06:41.520
Go yell at her.

06:41.520 --> 06:43.022
Ted, you may be from ohio,

06:43.122 --> 06:44.624
But you live in new york now.

06:44.624 --> 06:46.926
We don't push down our feelings in new york.

06:46.926 --> 06:48.527
We take our feelings and we shove them

06:48.527 --> 06:49.929
In somebody else's face!

06:49.929 --> 06:51.331
Oh, spare me, lily.

06:51.331 --> 06:52.231
You'd be doing the same thing

06:52.231 --> 06:53.433
If you were in this situation.

06:53.433 --> 06:54.634
Thats out of rageous.

06:54.634 --> 06:56.536
There is not a person on earth

06:56.536 --> 06:58.338
I would hide under a table from.

06:58.338 --> 07:00.740
Oh, really, not a single person?

07:00.740 --> 07:03.443
Not even... Gasser?

07:03.544 --> 07:06.347
How dare you mention that name to me.

07:06.516 --> 07:07.528
Who's gasser?

07:07.818 --> 07:08.939
He's the last person

07:08.949 --> 07:11.202
I'd want to see walk through that door.

07:11.311 --> 07:12.753
Michael sasser.

07:13.074 --> 07:15.096
He's a guy I went to high school with.

07:15.186 --> 07:17.849
Michael sat next to me in freshman biology.

07:17.859 --> 07:20.472
He had been a bit of a loser all through middle school,

07:20.482 --> 07:22.463
But the summer before ninth grade,

07:22.473 --> 07:25.217
He grew 12 inches and joined the baseball team.

07:25.227 --> 07:26.448
He was right on the precipice

07:26.458 --> 07:28.740
Of becoming one of the cool kids.

07:28.861 --> 07:30.372
Until one day...

07:32.575 --> 07:35.186
Oh, lily, we've all been there.

07:35.196 --> 07:37.159
When you've ripped one, it's not pretty.

07:37.169 --> 07:38.471
What did you do?

07:38.481 --> 07:39.752
Are you kidding?

07:39.762 --> 07:41.493
This was ninth grade.

07:41.734 --> 07:43.836
I only had one choice.

07:44.006 --> 07:46.499
Oh, my god, sasser.

07:46.509 --> 07:47.860
Fart much?

07:48.370 --> 07:50.283
No, it wasn't me. It was her.

07:50.293 --> 07:52.495
Oh, as if, sasser.

07:52.505 --> 07:54.397
More like gasser.

07:54.757 --> 07:55.618
Gasser!

07:55.628 --> 07:57.871
Gasser! Gasser!

07:57.880 --> 07:59.112
No. Gasser! Gasser! Gasser! Gasser!

07:59.122 --> 08:00.383
I'm on the baseball team.

08:00.393 --> 08:01.685
I-i'm cool.

08:01.695 --> 08:03.887
Gasser! Gasser!

08:03.897 --> 08:05.799
The nickname gasser stuck.

08:05.809 --> 08:06.750
He got teased so much,

08:06.760 --> 08:09.022
Eventually he had to change schools.

08:09.443 --> 08:10.975
Kids are awesome.

08:10.985 --> 08:13.247
I've always felt awful about that.

08:13.257 --> 08:15.670
But if gasser-- michael--

08:15.780 --> 08:18.763
Walked in right now, as hard as it would be,

08:18.773 --> 08:21.095
I would go up to gasser-- michael--

08:21.266 --> 08:23.147
And I would resolve things between us.

08:23.157 --> 08:25.290
Right, clear the air, as it were.

08:25.310 --> 08:26.781
Oh, man.

08:27.051 --> 08:29.063
Those don't come around often.

08:29.214 --> 08:30.866
Y'all are welcome.

08:33.248 --> 08:34.710
Hey, are you guys okay? Oh, yeah.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.491
We're just gonna be eating down here if that's okay.

08:36.501 --> 08:38.203
Well, here's your almonds.

08:38.214 --> 08:40.235
Oh, thanks... You guys have any specials today?

08:40.245 --> 08:41.357
Ted, this is ludicrous.

08:41.366 --> 08:45.731
Ted, I am a person who... Well, let's just face it.

08:45.741 --> 08:47.844
There are a lot of people I don't want to see--

08:47.854 --> 08:50.387
People of the "chicks I banged" persuasion--

08:50.526 --> 08:52.148
But if any of them were to walk in here,

08:52.158 --> 08:53.389
I would stand up,

08:53.399 --> 08:55.272
And I would look them right in the eye.

08:55.541 --> 08:57.374
Some of them for the very first time.

08:58.485 --> 09:00.887
Really, you wouldn't hide from anyone?

09:01.548 --> 09:03.240
Not even, say...

09:03.280 --> 09:04.742
Becca delucci?

09:04.742 --> 09:06.343
You son of a bitch.

09:06.653 --> 09:08.185
Who's becca delucci?

09:08.275 --> 09:09.447
Do you mind?

09:13.560 --> 09:14.912
So, who is becca delucci?

09:14.922 --> 09:17.024
Becca is just this girl who lives upstate.

09:17.034 --> 09:18.596
I used to visit her now and again.

09:18.606 --> 09:21.479
Mm-hmm, where exactly upstate, barney?

09:22.711 --> 09:25.192
Bedford hills federal penitentiary.

09:25.202 --> 09:28.926
And yes, the visits were of a conjugal nature.

09:28.936 --> 09:32.570
No way, really?

09:32.580 --> 09:33.412
Really.

09:33.462 --> 09:36.705
And what I had with becca was a perfect relationship.

09:36.735 --> 09:40.229
She was only allowed, by law, to call me once a week.

09:40.579 --> 09:41.771
If she ever got clingy,

09:41.781 --> 09:43.813
The armed guards stopped her.

09:44.053 --> 09:45.744
And I never had to pay for dinner.

09:45.854 --> 09:47.956
Well, that's not true. I pay taxes.

09:47.966 --> 09:49.308
Then again, I guess we all paid for dinner.

09:49.318 --> 09:50.469
Thanks a lot, guys.

09:50.529 --> 09:52.682
Anyway, the last time I visited,

09:53.082 --> 09:54.814
I kind of screwed things up.

09:54.824 --> 09:56.786
I know it's hard, baby,

09:56.966 --> 09:59.359
But I'm in a prison, too.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.441
A prison of my own heart.

10:02.452 --> 10:04.084
Is that room ready yet or what?

10:04.094 --> 10:06.236
Can we...? Tick-tock.

10:06.967 --> 10:08.368
Barney, you're the only thing

10:08.378 --> 10:09.920
That's keeping me going here.

10:09.930 --> 10:11.201
That's what I'm here for, baby.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.563
I'm your rock.

10:12.893 --> 10:14.175
I'm... Oh, my god.

10:14.185 --> 10:15.876
Hello, strange.

10:20.862 --> 10:22.853
Barney stinson, attorney at law.

10:22.863 --> 10:24.425
Let's talk about getting you off.

10:24.435 --> 10:25.977
Oh, hell, no!

10:38.040 --> 10:40.493
Now I get letters from becca and she's all,

10:40.503 --> 10:42.855
"i'm coming to get you the day I get out of here.

10:42.865 --> 10:45.808
I'm gonna hang your eyes from my rearview mirror."

10:47.079 --> 10:48.501
Women, huh?

10:49.291 --> 10:51.174
See? You're scared of becca.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.645
Lily's scared of gasser.

10:52.655 --> 10:54.197
We're staying under the table.

10:57.550 --> 10:59.523
We don't have to. Stella's gone.

10:59.533 --> 11:01.164
Oh, my gosh.

11:03.676 --> 11:05.278
There, all done,

11:05.289 --> 11:08.351
And that's how we do it ohio style.

11:08.542 --> 11:11.034
Problem showed up. We avoided it. It went away.

11:11.044 --> 11:13.046
Now we can enjoy our meal in peace and...

11:13.056 --> 11:14.117
She's back.

11:18.492 --> 11:20.975
Ted, we all think that you need--

11:21.275 --> 11:22.656
Wait, where's barney?

11:27.822 --> 11:28.773
Ted,

11:28.853 --> 11:31.336
We all think that you need to go talk to her.

11:31.346 --> 11:32.457
I don't. What?

11:32.467 --> 11:33.939
Yeah, if t last person I wanted to see

11:33.949 --> 11:35.860
Walked through the door, I wouldn't say a damn word.

11:35.870 --> 11:36.501
Really?

11:36.512 --> 11:38.654
And who's that? My father.

11:39.624 --> 11:42.267
You guys, that other table is off the hook.

11:42.468 --> 11:44.419
What are we talking about? Robin's dad.

11:44.429 --> 11:45.751
I haven't spoken to him in three years

11:45.761 --> 11:47.373
And I don't intend to start now.

11:47.383 --> 11:48.234
Why?

11:48.384 --> 11:50.797
It goes back to the day I was born.

11:50.807 --> 11:52.868
You give me my son now. Push.

11:57.744 --> 11:59.155
Oh, no... Oh, no.

11:59.595 --> 12:00.676
He wanted a son

12:00.686 --> 12:02.829
And the fact that I was a girl didn't change his plan.

12:02.970 --> 12:03.740
What do you mean?

12:04.771 --> 12:08.705
My full legal name is robin charles scherbatsky, jr.

12:09.776 --> 12:11.668
And it only gets worse from there.

12:11.888 --> 12:15.091
When I was eight, he took me hunting for the first time.

12:15.101 --> 12:16.944
I don't want to shoot a deer.

12:16.954 --> 12:18.426
Nonsense, r.J.

12:18.466 --> 12:19.076
Shooting deer

12:19.086 --> 12:20.808
Is the noblest of pursuits.

12:20.818 --> 12:22.790
But they're cute.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.812
You said the same thing about our rabbits.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.815
Remember how delicious they were?

12:28.345 --> 12:30.058
Over the years, as my body developed...

12:30.068 --> 12:31.389
Whoa, hold on a sec.

12:32.871 --> 12:34.042
Sorry, go on.

12:35.043 --> 12:38.617
It became harder and harder for him to pretend I was a boy.

12:38.777 --> 12:41.090
The lowest moment came when I turned 14.

12:41.100 --> 12:43.792
My peewee hockey team had just won the squamish invitational

12:43.802 --> 12:46.104
And everyone came back to my house to celebrate.

12:46.114 --> 12:47.916
You lads availed yourself splendidly

12:47.926 --> 12:49.649
Out there on the ice.

12:49.948 --> 12:52.701
Splendidly. You go on outside.

12:52.712 --> 12:54.563
I'll come back with an assortment

12:54.573 --> 12:57.196
Of soft drinks and american pretzels.

13:00.469 --> 13:00.860
I can't believe

13:00.870 --> 13:02.912
You missed that last empty-netter, you hoser.

13:02.922 --> 13:04.223
You're the hoser.

13:04.233 --> 13:05.645
No, you're the hoser.

13:13.394 --> 13:14.364
What are you doing?

13:15.476 --> 13:18.369
You're teammates, hockey players.

13:19.300 --> 13:20.931
Teammates don't kiss!

13:21.823 --> 13:24.065
Hockey players don't kiss!

13:26.427 --> 13:27.588
Oh, my god.

13:28.910 --> 13:30.201
I have no son.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.617
Oh, you poor thing.

13:36.347 --> 13:38.510
To have to grow up in canada

13:38.520 --> 13:40.392
With america right there.

13:40.973 --> 13:41.673
That...

13:41.683 --> 13:43.835
Sucks about your dad, robin,

13:43.845 --> 13:46.047
But congratulations on that game.

13:47.659 --> 13:49.892
And kyle and I weren't even doing anything serious.

13:49.902 --> 13:52.605
We only went to the blue line. The blue line?

13:52.615 --> 13:54.486
Yeah, you know how when you're a kid,

13:54.496 --> 13:55.698
You put everything into hockey terms?

13:55.708 --> 13:57.980
The blue line is kissing; the red line is getting naked;

13:57.990 --> 14:00.382
And I think "in the crease" speaks for itself.

14:01.384 --> 14:02.675
Anyway, after that,

14:02.685 --> 14:04.998
My relationship with my dad pretty much went north.

14:05.008 --> 14:06.329
I moved in with my mom,

14:06.339 --> 14:09.082
Grew my hair out, became a canadian pop star.

14:09.092 --> 14:10.724
You know, normal teen stuff.

14:11.214 --> 14:12.766
Don't you think it would feel better

14:12.776 --> 14:14.388
To talk to him about all this?

14:14.398 --> 14:15.899
No, that's the point.

14:15.909 --> 14:17.511
It wouldn't solve anything.

14:17.521 --> 14:19.233
It's in the past. It's done.

14:20.244 --> 14:21.626
I mean, what would I even say to him?

14:21.636 --> 14:23.637
"i wish you hadn't raised me as a boy"?

14:23.647 --> 14:26.070
"i wish you hadn't taught me how to hunt

14:26.080 --> 14:28.472
"and fish and smoke cigars and drink scotch

14:28.482 --> 14:30.414
"because that's not what girls do.

14:30.434 --> 14:32.447
"and you know the reason I throw like a girl, dad,

14:32.457 --> 14:34.158
Is because I am a girl."

14:36.270 --> 14:39.754
Wow, you held onto that for a long time, huh?

14:40.525 --> 14:41.446
Yeah.

14:42.307 --> 14:43.839
It really messed you up.

14:45.250 --> 14:46.201
Yeah.

14:46.211 --> 14:47.032
That sucks. I'm sorry.

14:47.152 --> 14:48.293
That's hot.

14:50.085 --> 14:51.607
And then I realized...

14:54.179 --> 14:56.052
All of my friends were haunted,

14:56.612 --> 14:59.325
But there was a difference between my ghost and theirs.

15:00.236 --> 15:01.747
It wasn't too late for me.

15:03.289 --> 15:04.721
I'm gonna go talk to her.

15:10.897 --> 15:11.889
She's gone.

15:12.088 --> 15:13.040
I'm going after her.

15:13.050 --> 15:14.410
Whoo. Go, go.

15:16.813 --> 15:18.054
There she goes!

15:25.402 --> 15:25.963
Okay, I see her.

15:25.973 --> 15:27.315
She's two cabs ahead on the right.

15:27.325 --> 15:28.356
Just stay with her, okay?

15:28.366 --> 15:30.488
Finally. Finally, you're doing this.

15:30.498 --> 15:31.809
You're going to confront her.

15:31.819 --> 15:33.641
Yes, I am going to confront her. Yeah.

15:33.651 --> 15:34.842
This is so exciting.

15:34.852 --> 15:36.444
Totally. What are you going to say?

15:36.454 --> 15:41.039
I'm gonna say, "stella, I'm sorry things didn't work out."

15:41.049 --> 15:42.911
Ay, caramba. No! Yes.

15:42.921 --> 15:44.913
We're going to talk about this like adults.

15:44.923 --> 15:48.306
She can tell me her side and... I'm going to listen.

15:48.847 --> 15:49.417
Probably

15:49.427 --> 15:50.739
Should have done a little more of that before.

15:50.749 --> 15:52.181
Driver, can you run us into the nearest lamppost?

15:52.191 --> 15:54.373
Everyone, buckle up. Not you, ted.

15:54.383 --> 15:55.534
Ted, ted,

15:55.544 --> 15:57.356
You got to get mad right now.

15:57.366 --> 15:59.358
Come on. Dig deep.

15:59.368 --> 16:01.410
Dude, come on. This isn't about me waving my arms,

16:01.420 --> 16:03.313
Stamping my feet, and getting really mad.

16:03.323 --> 16:04.693
This is about stella and i

16:04.703 --> 16:06.165
Finally communicating.

16:06.175 --> 16:07.056
I mean, clearly, that was...

16:07.066 --> 16:10.470
Stella hated star wars. She lied to you.

16:10.480 --> 16:13.493
Search your feelings, ted. You know it to be true.

16:14.534 --> 16:15.865
Well, that's her business.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.839
Come on, ted. She left you at the altar.

16:18.849 --> 16:20.120
I don't understand!

16:20.130 --> 16:22.172
Ted, in the name of all that is sacred...

16:22.182 --> 16:23.263
Wait, wait, wait!

16:23.344 --> 16:24.304
Where is she going?

16:24.314 --> 16:26.266
Her cab just missed the turn for the lincoln tunnel.

16:26.276 --> 16:27.208
Why would anybody

16:27.218 --> 16:28.038
Buy takeout food

16:28.048 --> 16:30.361
And bring it all the way back to new jersey anyway?

16:30.541 --> 16:31.843
Maybe she's going to her office.

16:31.853 --> 16:32.864
No.

16:33.394 --> 16:35.766
The waiter asked her, "will you need utensils?"

16:35.776 --> 16:37.949
And then she said, "nah, I'm just going straight home."

16:38.209 --> 16:40.382
But if she's going home, why are we still heading...?

16:41.393 --> 16:42.484
Oh, my god.

16:43.725 --> 16:44.886
Tony lives downtown.

16:45.707 --> 16:48.870
"home" is tony's apartment.

16:48.880 --> 16:51.342
She was going to make me move to new jersey

16:51.352 --> 16:54.767
And then she moves into the city with tony?!

16:55.437 --> 16:56.949
Son of a bitch!

16:57.329 --> 16:58.000
Finally.

16:58.010 --> 16:59.121
Finally, buddy.

16:59.131 --> 17:00.583
I am so angry right now!

17:00.593 --> 17:02.254
I know, and I love it!

17:04.287 --> 17:05.828
Yeah, that is awesome!

17:05.838 --> 17:07.349
Sir, we'd be happy to cover

17:07.359 --> 17:09.412
The cost of that window crank.

17:09.521 --> 17:11.094
I love angry ted!

17:11.104 --> 17:12.425
So do i!

17:13.867 --> 17:16.429
Get it out, baby. Let it out.

17:16.439 --> 17:17.851
Oh... She's stopping.

17:17.861 --> 17:18.892
Oh, it is on.

17:18.902 --> 17:20.403
It is on! Yes, ted.

17:20.413 --> 17:21.744
Go get her, buddy!

17:21.755 --> 17:23.137
Go get rid of your demons!

17:23.146 --> 17:24.417
My leg is asleep!

17:24.428 --> 17:25.409
Okay, wa-wa-wait.

17:25.569 --> 17:26.369
Wait, hold on. Lily,

17:26.380 --> 17:27.090
What are you doing?

17:27.101 --> 17:28.882
All right, hold on.

17:29.243 --> 17:30.734
Look, ted,

17:30.814 --> 17:33.317
It's great that you're angry right now. It sure is.

17:33.327 --> 17:34.618
Yes. Yeah!

17:34.989 --> 17:36.220
And that you're finally dealing

17:36.230 --> 17:39.113
With this, but you only get one shot here.

17:39.143 --> 17:40.605
Let's just take a beat and,

17:40.615 --> 17:42.877
And think about what you're going to say.

17:44.128 --> 17:45.961
Oh, I know exactly what I'm gonna say.

17:56.652 --> 17:58.084
You picked the wrong guy.

17:59.795 --> 18:00.786
Ted.

18:01.627 --> 18:03.429
You picked the wrong guy.

18:05.191 --> 18:09.856
You made a really, really, really bad choice.

18:11.978 --> 18:13.219
What were you thinking?

18:13.289 --> 18:14.320
That guy?

18:14.651 --> 18:16.123
Are you kidding me?

18:16.883 --> 18:19.035
Have you learned nothing in the last eight years?

18:20.116 --> 18:21.528
You're just gonna regret this.

18:21.538 --> 18:22.459
You know that, right?

18:22.469 --> 18:24.131
You are going to regret this,

18:24.141 --> 18:25.852
And now there is nothing you can do about it

18:25.862 --> 18:27.374
Because it's too late.

18:28.495 --> 18:29.927
All you can do now is go up there

18:29.937 --> 18:33.330
And start your crappy, disappointing life

18:34.082 --> 18:35.703
That will never be nearly as happy

18:35.713 --> 18:37.405
As the one you could have had with me.

18:39.928 --> 18:40.828
Good-bye.

18:41.348 --> 18:42.140
Ted, wait.

18:42.150 --> 18:45.293
Look, stella, I am not here to win you back.

18:45.593 --> 18:46.083
I am here

18:46.093 --> 18:49.408
Because I need to know that you know

18:50.058 --> 18:51.880
You made the biggest mistake of your life.

18:53.251 --> 18:54.243
I know.

18:57.847 --> 18:58.747
Good.

19:01.850 --> 19:03.182
That's what I'm gonna say. Oh...

19:04.824 --> 19:06.815
Cold-blooded. Yeah, that's good.

19:06.825 --> 19:08.137
Go say that.

19:10.980 --> 19:11.861
Thanks.

19:12.451 --> 19:15.445
So I got out of the cab, ready to say all of that stuff,

19:15.455 --> 19:18.008
Ready to explode, but then...

19:18.018 --> 19:19.859
Mommy! H-h-hey. Hey.

19:24.325 --> 19:25.865
It all just went away.

19:30.791 --> 19:32.032
And that was it.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.174
In that moment, I wasn't angry anymore.

19:35.325 --> 19:37.618
I could see stella was meant to be with tony.

19:38.959 --> 19:40.521
Kids, you may think your only choices

19:40.531 --> 19:42.053
Are to swallow your anger

19:42.063 --> 19:43.674
Or throw it in someone's face.

19:44.045 --> 19:45.597
there is a third option

19:45.677 --> 19:47.078
You can just let it go,

19:47.789 --> 19:49.781
And only when you do that is it really gone,

19:49.791 --> 19:51.132
And you can move forward.

19:51.633 --> 19:55.837
And that, kids, was the perfect ending to a perfect love story.

19:56.068 --> 19:57.569
It just wasn't mine.

19:58.420 --> 20:01.293
Mine was still out there waiting for me.

20:02.305 --> 20:08.496
