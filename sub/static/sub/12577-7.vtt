00:33.566 --> 00:36.069
Good old mason 1500.

00:36.069 --> 00:38.071
Handles like
the day I bought her.

00:38.071 --> 00:38.822
I tell you what,

00:39.322 --> 00:41.324
this is the only mower
i'd want with me

00:41.324 --> 00:43.827
if I were ever stranded on a desert island.

00:43.827 --> 00:45.328
You are gonna kill

00:45.328 --> 00:47.697
at that lawn mower
focus group tomorrow, hank.

00:47.697 --> 00:50.667
Now, dale, a focus group
is not a competition.

00:50.667 --> 00:53.670
It's a chance for the informed
lawn mower consumer

00:53.670 --> 00:56.372
to give valuable input
to the mason corporation

00:56.372 --> 00:58.174
in a comfortable
mall setting.

00:58.174 --> 01:00.794
Well, I think it's just an honor
to be invited.

01:00.794 --> 01:03.129
You know, I'll tell you why
we've gotta go tomorrow.

01:03.630 --> 01:05.131
Look at your average
pickup truck.

01:05.598 --> 01:08.101
With air bags
and vanity mirrors,

01:08.101 --> 01:11.805
it's one focus group away from turning
into a powder room.

01:11.805 --> 01:14.307
We can't let that happen
to the mason 1500.

01:14.607 --> 01:16.559
We sure can't,can we?

01:16.559 --> 01:17.560
[sighs]

01:17.560 --> 01:19.062
bill, the only reason

01:19.062 --> 01:21.064
I invited dale and boomhauer
and not you

01:21.064 --> 01:23.316
is 'cause you're coming over
for thanksgiving dinner,

01:23.316 --> 01:25.201
and I didn't want
you to get sick of me.

01:25.201 --> 01:26.152
[tittering]

01:26.152 --> 01:29.155
oh, hank, I will
never be sick of you.

01:29.155 --> 01:31.491
Not even when we're sharing a cloud in heaven.

01:31.491 --> 01:32.459
[sighing]

01:32.959 --> 01:33.960
all right,you can come.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.912
But when I make a point,
just nod.

01:35.912 --> 01:36.913
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

01:36.913 --> 01:38.631
(tilly)
hank, you asked me
to tell you

01:38.631 --> 01:41.417
when celine dion
is off the field. She's off.

01:41.751 --> 01:42.919
(hank)
thanks, mom.

01:43.419 --> 01:44.420
[sighs]

01:44.420 --> 01:45.255
aren't moms great?

01:45.722 --> 01:47.056
(both)
yeah, they are.
Uh-huh

01:47.056 --> 01:48.424
I tell you what
i'm thankful for

01:48.925 --> 01:51.928
that it's my mom's turn to spend thanksgiving
with us.

01:51.928 --> 01:54.430
She eats the dark meat
and doesn't complain.

01:54.430 --> 01:55.932
Boy, I tell you, she..

01:55.932 --> 01:57.317
What the...

01:58.768 --> 02:01.271
You lawn jockeys
were standing here

02:01.271 --> 02:03.606
when I left 2 months ago.
Pathetic!

02:03.606 --> 02:06.109
Dad, you came
last thanksgiving.

02:06.109 --> 02:07.994
This year it's
mom's turn, remember?

02:08.443 --> 02:10.947
Well, I don't want
to cause any fuss.

02:10.947 --> 02:13.283
Your mother can
eat in the yard!

02:16.619 --> 02:18.621
Now, in addition
to all the things

02:18.621 --> 02:20.957
we normally don't talk about
in front of my dad,

02:20.957 --> 02:23.793
let me add my mason compan
y focus group.

02:24.294 --> 02:26.212
How could you be worried
about this focus group?

02:26.212 --> 02:29.215
Your father is gonna ruin
this thanksgiving

02:29.215 --> 02:33.970
as surely as squanto and his band of indians
ruined the first one.

02:33.970 --> 02:34.971
[gasps]

02:34.971 --> 02:35.972
oh, will you
look at the time.

02:35.972 --> 02:37.974
We've got to get
this dinner on the table

02:37.974 --> 02:40.476
because we are getting up
at 4:00 tomorrow morning.

02:40.476 --> 02:41.477
huh?

02:41.477 --> 02:43.479
It is a 2-hour
drive to the mall,

02:43.897 --> 02:45.899
and I want us there right
when the doors open.

02:46.366 --> 02:48.868
I have never gotten up
that early in my life

02:48.868 --> 02:50.653
unless fish were involved.

02:50.653 --> 02:53.990
Hank, the day after thanksgiving is,
in my opinion,

02:53.990 --> 02:56.159
the biggest shopping day
of the year.

02:56.159 --> 02:59.329
And I will not spend another year
giving dallas mavericks crap

02:59.329 --> 03:01.414
because the cowboys stuff
was all sold out.

03:01.414 --> 03:03.917
So I want us
in bed by 7:30.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.969
I won't be able
to fall asleep that early.

03:05.969 --> 03:07.971
You are not
even trying.

03:07.971 --> 03:09.973
Have another beer.

03:09.973 --> 03:12.475
Oh, well,
it's worth a shot.

03:12.926 --> 03:16.429
(hank)
dear lord, we are grateful
that cotton has forgotten

03:16.930 --> 03:21.401
our carefully worked-out
holiday parent-rotation schedule,

03:21.401 --> 03:25.405
so that we may all be together
on this day. Amen.

03:25.405 --> 03:26.739
(all)
amen.

03:29.108 --> 03:30.493
[burping]

03:30.493 --> 03:33.696
tilly, did you
make this stuffing?

03:33.696 --> 03:35.999
'cause it tastes
like garbage!

03:36.366 --> 03:37.116
Uh, dad.

03:37.500 --> 03:39.118
Did I ever tell you
about the time

03:39.118 --> 03:41.421
she tried to poison me
with her baked chicken?

03:41.421 --> 03:43.957
Oh, it was
chicken almondine.

03:43.957 --> 03:46.092
It was cyanide, woman!

03:46.092 --> 03:48.711
Uh, dad,
could you please

03:48.711 --> 03:52.131
show mom some respect
while bobby's in the room?

03:52.131 --> 03:55.134
You heard him, bobby.
Leave the room.

03:55.134 --> 03:57.136
(hank)
no, sit down, bobby.

03:57.637 --> 03:59.639
Could you at least
respect grandmom

03:59.639 --> 04:01.140
until we get to dessert?

04:01.140 --> 04:02.642
Didi's your grandmom,
too, bobby.

04:03.142 --> 04:04.944
Your pretty grandmom.dad.

04:04.944 --> 04:07.447
'course, bad as tilly
was in the kitchen,

04:07.447 --> 04:09.399
she was even
worse in the bedroom!

04:09.399 --> 04:10.733
[gasps]

04:10.733 --> 04:11.985
[grunts]

04:11.985 --> 04:15.204
I said, the woman was lousy
in the sack.

04:18.875 --> 04:19.875
[sighing]

04:21.461 --> 04:22.795
[sighing]

04:26.049 --> 04:27.500
to the stuffing.

04:28.001 --> 04:30.887
Might taste like garbage,
but it sure fills you up.

04:33.339 --> 04:35.591
Come on, peggy. Turn off
your itty-bitty headlamp,

04:35.591 --> 04:37.093
and let's get some sleep.

04:37.093 --> 04:39.595
This is 6 malls
over texas, hank.

04:39.595 --> 04:42.849
If you go unprepared,
it will eat you alive.

04:42.849 --> 04:44.267
(tilly)
goodnight, peggy.

04:44.267 --> 04:46.269
That was a lovely dinner.

04:46.269 --> 04:47.770
Goodnight, son.

04:48.271 --> 04:49.272
hmm.

04:49.272 --> 04:51.774
Well, mom seemed
to enjoy herself tonight.

04:52.191 --> 04:54.610
You defended troy aikman
more than you defended your mother.

04:54.610 --> 04:57.113
Mom knows
how it is with dad.

04:57.113 --> 04:59.115
And there were
6 dropped passes.

04:59.615 --> 05:01.501
All troy can do
is get it there.

05:01.501 --> 05:03.503
[scissors snipping]

05:12.712 --> 05:14.714
ok, everyone,
follow my beam.

05:14.714 --> 05:16.099
Hurry carefully.

05:16.599 --> 05:17.600
(cotton)
good morning.

05:17.600 --> 05:20.353
I hopes we wasn't
too loud last night.

05:23.189 --> 05:25.692
Just so you know,
you kids are on your own today.

05:25.692 --> 05:28.194
I'm taking bobby
ice-skating at the mall.

05:28.194 --> 05:29.696
We're gonna
go meet guys.

05:30.196 --> 05:31.364
I'm the bait.

05:31.364 --> 05:33.983
What?
Guys love single moms.

05:39.489 --> 05:40.490
[cotton exclaiming]

05:40.490 --> 05:43.493
(cotton)
I forgot how much
old ladies stink.

05:52.418 --> 05:56.422
Good god, you've got
a fat neck, hank!

05:56.422 --> 05:58.925
So, dad, I thought
we'd split up at the mall.

05:58.925 --> 06:01.844
Oh, are you gonna
talk the whole way?

06:02.929 --> 06:04.430
[music playing]

06:04.430 --> 06:06.432
(cotton)
i'm gonna head down
to the corn dog shack

06:06.432 --> 06:10.069
and watch the girlies
make lemonade.

06:10.069 --> 06:11.404
[people chattering]

06:11.404 --> 06:12.772
goodbye, peggy

06:12.772 --> 06:13.773
no time.

06:20.613 --> 06:22.582
Oh, fire truck!

06:22.582 --> 06:24.000
Hi, how long
would it take

06:24.000 --> 06:27.086
to glue a rubber sole
back on a lady's loafer?

06:27.086 --> 06:28.588
5 minutes.

06:28.588 --> 06:32.041
Lady's loafer?
That's a men's loafer.

06:32.542 --> 06:34.043
It is a uni-loafer.

06:34.794 --> 06:36.796
Uh, have it your way.

06:36.796 --> 06:38.798
This is gonna
take a while.

06:38.798 --> 06:40.299
[sighing]

06:41.801 --> 06:42.802
hmm.

06:54.063 --> 06:56.032
(kahn)
hey, here come
leftover turkeys.

06:56.032 --> 06:57.533
[laughing]

06:57.533 --> 06:59.035
oh, hell, you're here?

06:59.035 --> 07:02.321
I am everywhere
you want to be, hank hill.

07:02.705 --> 07:04.824
I'm jonathan burrows,
your moderator.

07:04.824 --> 07:07.326
My research associates and I
at research associates

07:07.326 --> 07:10.546
have only one client:
the american consumer.

07:10.546 --> 07:13.049
Yes, we're being paid
by the mason corporation.

07:13.049 --> 07:15.051
But we are paid
to be independent.

07:15.051 --> 07:16.552
(dale)
i'll do all the talkin'.

07:16.552 --> 07:18.054
(bill)
all right.
What's the matter?

07:18.554 --> 07:21.891
We may or may not have run into your dad
in the men's room,

07:21.891 --> 07:24.844
and we may or may not
have told him

07:24.844 --> 07:28.848
that we were being paid $50 to participate
in a focus group.

07:28.848 --> 07:30.399
Mostly, may.

07:30.399 --> 07:31.684
[sighs]

07:33.069 --> 07:34.570
dad, that was a close one.

07:34.570 --> 07:35.822
[tittering]

07:35.822 --> 07:37.323
now what you're
gonna want to do

07:37.323 --> 07:39.325
is turn around,
head out the door,

07:39.325 --> 07:40.827
and well, once
you're out the door

07:41.327 --> 07:43.162
there really
is no wrong turn.

07:43.162 --> 07:44.831
Out of my way.

07:44.831 --> 07:45.832
[sighs]

07:45.832 --> 07:47.834
damn.

07:47.834 --> 07:50.203
Why don't we start
by introducing ourselves?

07:50.203 --> 07:51.704
Kahn souphanousinphone

07:51.704 --> 07:53.206
I am system analyst.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.707
So that's what you do.

07:54.707 --> 07:56.175
What kind of systems?

07:56.175 --> 07:57.510
Oh, why bother explain?

07:57.510 --> 07:58.878
you're already
in over your head.

07:59.295 --> 08:00.596
You, sir.

08:00.596 --> 08:03.349
Uh, lane pretly.I own pretly ford,
pretly hyundai,

08:03.349 --> 08:05.351
and I got my eye
on pretly cadillac.

08:05.852 --> 08:07.353
My daddy ain't
doing so good.

08:07.353 --> 08:09.605
Hey, you sold me
an escort once.

08:11.190 --> 08:12.191
[moans]

08:12.191 --> 08:14.694
boyce hubert, minister,

08:14.694 --> 08:16.696
although I've lost my faith.

08:16.696 --> 08:20.116
'course,
I did find a pretty great
parking space on my way in.

08:20.116 --> 08:22.285
But the lord works
in such mysterious ways,

08:22.285 --> 08:24.904
who the hell knows?

08:24.904 --> 08:27.657
Uh, my name's hank hill
and I--

08:27.657 --> 08:29.458
He runs a gas station. Next.

08:29.458 --> 08:33.129
I'm cotton hill.
I killed 50 men.

08:33.129 --> 08:34.630
Is that a real computer?

08:34.630 --> 08:35.631
yes.

08:35.631 --> 08:37.383
Oh, in that case,

08:37.383 --> 08:42.054
my name is
rusty shackelford.

08:43.389 --> 08:44.590
Shackelford.

08:47.426 --> 08:49.428
You can just go ahead
and call me boomhauer, man.

08:49.428 --> 08:51.931
You know,that dang old last name,
you know, meathead.

08:51.931 --> 08:53.432
Did a lot of
different things.

08:53.432 --> 08:55.851
Had a job back
there in that company.

08:55.851 --> 08:58.354
Settlement, man.
Old workers' comp, too, man.

08:58.354 --> 08:59.989
It's tax-free, man.

09:03.659 --> 09:04.777
Ok. Uh, you, sir.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.529
I'm bill dauterive

09:06.529 --> 09:09.115
i'm a sergeant barber
in the united states army.

09:09.115 --> 09:11.617
I'm 5'8.75" tall.

09:11.617 --> 09:13.119
My wife, lenore,
divorced me

09:13.119 --> 09:15.922
in the year of our lord 1991.

09:15.922 --> 09:17.456
That's about it.

09:17.456 --> 09:19.959
Super.What a fine lot you are.

09:19.959 --> 09:22.295
And now I'd like
to direct your attention

09:22.295 --> 09:25.214
to the best that the mason corporation
has to offer.

09:25.214 --> 09:28.100
That's my mower,
the mason 1500.

09:28.935 --> 09:30.052
[all exclaim]

09:30.052 --> 09:33.389
the mason 2500!

09:33.689 --> 09:34.607
Lord have mercy.

09:34.607 --> 09:35.775
[exclaims]

09:35.775 --> 09:37.476
that's not my mower!

09:41.030 --> 09:43.149
They call this progress?

09:43.149 --> 09:44.900
They've pushed out
all the mower

09:44.900 --> 09:48.321
to make room for cruise control,
zero turning radius,

09:48.821 --> 09:50.706
featherweight
space-age polymers,

09:50.706 --> 09:52.708
optional rear bag
attachment,

09:52.708 --> 09:55.211
tommy hilfinger sports package

09:55.544 --> 09:56.996
I love this mower so much

09:56.996 --> 10:00.333
my--my heart hurts

10:00.333 --> 10:02.168
why? Why do you
love it so much?

10:02.168 --> 10:04.170
Because hank hill
will never be able

10:04.670 --> 10:06.672
to afford one
on his meager salary.

10:06.672 --> 10:09.225
My boy's a pump jockey.
Works for tips.

10:09.225 --> 10:11.227
Dad, I do not
work for tips.

10:11.227 --> 10:12.645
Pump jockey!

10:12.645 --> 10:14.146
Dad, I am not a pump--

10:14.146 --> 10:15.648
Works for tips

10:15.765 --> 10:18.267
I like the mower.
It's got a lot of nice curves,

10:18.267 --> 10:19.769
like a purty young woman.

10:20.269 --> 10:22.271
Hank's mower's
like a dumpy fishwife.

10:25.825 --> 10:27.443
[music playing]

10:27.443 --> 10:29.495
what are we
waiting for, luanne?

10:29.495 --> 10:30.746
um,

10:30.746 --> 10:34.200
Maybe it's too soon since...

10:34.200 --> 10:37.036
Buckley's not getting any deader, luanne.

10:37.036 --> 10:39.121
It's time to move on.

10:39.121 --> 10:40.423
Yeah.

10:40.423 --> 10:41.624
Let's go!

10:41.624 --> 10:43.376
[screaming]

10:43.876 --> 10:45.044
are you all right?

10:45.044 --> 10:46.429
[sobbing]

10:46.429 --> 10:51.133
it's just that they're playing
buckley and my song.

10:54.970 --> 10:55.855
hey.

10:56.806 --> 10:57.640
huh?

11:01.727 --> 11:02.611
[crying]

11:07.316 --> 11:08.567
[sighing]

11:08.567 --> 11:10.069
come on,betsy.

11:10.953 --> 11:12.455
Well, you gotta
love a product

11:12.455 --> 11:14.040
with this many options
and add-ons.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.042
See, that's where
you make your money.

11:16.042 --> 11:17.543
You take
your optional rear bag.

11:17.543 --> 11:19.378
Now, if I had
a mason dealership,

11:19.378 --> 11:20.713
i'd guaran-damn-tee you

11:20.713 --> 11:22.214
if you walked
into my showroom,

11:22.214 --> 11:24.717
you'd ride out
with that bag behind your ass.

11:24.717 --> 11:27.803
Yeah, you sold me
pinstripes for my escort.

11:27.803 --> 11:29.588
No, no, no.
Let me explain it to you.

11:29.588 --> 11:32.475
I financed you pinstripes
for your escort.

11:33.809 --> 11:35.728
So, if I'm hearing
you people,

11:35.728 --> 11:37.730
this mower has surpassed
your expectations

11:37.730 --> 11:39.565
and quite possibly
, your dreams?

11:39.565 --> 11:40.983
Now hold on.

11:40.983 --> 11:44.820
Boomhauer, bill, and, uh,
rusty and me don't like it.

11:44.820 --> 11:46.572
[snorts]

11:46.572 --> 11:48.407
'course you don't like it.
Anything I like,you don't like.

11:48.824 --> 11:50.693
Then when I say
I don't like somethin',

11:50.693 --> 11:52.661
for example your mother,

11:53.028 --> 11:56.365
you've gotta say
how much you like her even more!

11:56.365 --> 11:58.117
Please keep my mother
out of this.

11:59.085 --> 12:01.087
How about you, rusty?

12:01.587 --> 12:03.255
Rusty?

12:03.255 --> 12:04.757
Rusty.

12:04.757 --> 12:08.260
Oh, shackelford.
Yes, I am pro-mower.

12:08.260 --> 12:09.345
What?

12:09.345 --> 12:10.846
I like the ashtray

12:11.347 --> 12:13.432
don't be an idiot, dale.
That's the gas cap.

12:13.432 --> 12:16.185
He's an idiot.He can use it
however he wants.

12:16.185 --> 12:17.603
Thank you, colonel.

12:17.603 --> 12:19.105
[sighing]

12:19.105 --> 12:21.107
well, it looks like we're pretty close
to a consensus.

12:21.107 --> 12:23.559
Now if we could discuss
the electric seat warmer?

12:23.559 --> 12:24.944
Why would we need
our seat warmed?

12:25.394 --> 12:26.395
That's what pants are for.

12:26.896 --> 12:27.897
Right, boomhauer?

12:27.897 --> 12:29.031
I don't know,hank, man.

12:29.532 --> 12:31.534
Maybe dang old get naked
on that dang old thing, man.

12:32.034 --> 12:35.154
Heat my little,that little old vibrate
might feel good, man.

12:35.654 --> 12:38.491
So you're in favor
of the mower, Mr. Boomhauer?

12:38.958 --> 12:41.127
Man, dang old listen, man.

12:42.128 --> 12:43.963
[sighing]
boomhauer--

12:43.963 --> 12:45.297
Uh, I'd like
to make a point.

12:45.798 --> 12:47.133
I already made
your point, bill.

12:47.133 --> 12:48.134
We don't like it.

12:48.634 --> 12:50.636
We liked the old model,
thank you.

12:50.636 --> 12:53.556
Is that the point you wanted to make,
mr. Dauterive?

12:54.890 --> 12:57.393
yes.

12:57.393 --> 13:01.347
No! Hank, you have been
speaking for me for...

13:01.347 --> 13:02.898
I don't know how long.

13:02.898 --> 13:04.433
Years and years.

13:04.433 --> 13:05.935
Well, that sounds
about right.

13:05.935 --> 13:07.269
Well, starting today,

13:07.269 --> 13:11.240
william fontaine delatur dauterive
speaks for himself.

13:11.240 --> 13:12.691
Attaboy, phil!

13:12.691 --> 13:16.529
And what I have to say
will rock your world.

13:17.446 --> 13:19.198
I like the cup holder.

13:19.198 --> 13:21.000
Bill, we can order
you a cup holder,

13:21.000 --> 13:23.335
and I'll attach
it to your 1500.

13:23.335 --> 13:24.837
No, I'm sorry, Mr. Hill.

13:24.837 --> 13:28.290
Mason doesn't
make parts for models
that are being discontinued.

13:28.290 --> 13:29.625
Your mower is, uh...

13:29.625 --> 13:32.511
Oh, what's a nice word
for "obsolete"?

13:32.511 --> 13:33.345
Collectible?

13:33.345 --> 13:34.713
Perfect.

13:34.713 --> 13:35.548
Bill's on fire today!

13:36.015 --> 13:37.516
(lane)
way to go, hondo.

13:37.516 --> 13:38.851
Way to go, bill.

13:38.851 --> 13:40.719
Your mower's obsolete,
hank.

13:40.719 --> 13:43.439
When something gets old and tired,
you gotta trade up.

13:43.439 --> 13:45.774
You mean like you traded in
mother for didi?

13:46.225 --> 13:47.726
I didn't trade your mama in.

13:47.726 --> 13:49.812
A trade-in has some value.

13:49.812 --> 13:51.564
I scrapped her.

13:52.481 --> 13:53.983
Listen to all of you.

13:53.983 --> 13:55.985
You're hypnotized
by a slick mower

13:55.985 --> 13:57.987
with all sorts
of bells and whistles.

13:57.987 --> 13:59.989
And you're gonna fall for it.

13:59.989 --> 14:00.990
Well, I'm not.

14:00.990 --> 14:03.242
My mower is reliable,
low-maintenance,

14:03.626 --> 14:06.078
and has held up damn well
over the years.

14:06.078 --> 14:08.080
I've got a good mower.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.382
And I have got
a good mother.

14:10.382 --> 14:12.301
Well, so let's see
a show of hands.

14:12.301 --> 14:14.753
All those in favor
of the new model?

14:23.095 --> 14:26.098
Wait. Are we voting
for hank's mom or the mower?

14:26.098 --> 14:27.483
The mower.oh!

14:34.857 --> 14:36.659
Gentlemen,you've made it clear

14:36.659 --> 14:38.911
that this new mower is what
today's consumer wants.

14:39.245 --> 14:42.164
When do we get
our $50?

14:43.666 --> 14:45.117
We haven't
earned it yet.

14:45.117 --> 14:47.620
This invitation
specifically states

14:47.620 --> 14:49.622
that we are to discuss
this new lawn mower

14:50.122 --> 14:52.207
for 3 hours,
from 9:00 to noon.

14:52.207 --> 14:54.209
We still have
an hour-and-a-half.

14:54.543 --> 14:55.628
[all grumbling]

14:55.628 --> 14:57.463
give us a break, hank.

14:57.463 --> 14:58.964
When you little redneck boy,

14:58.964 --> 15:00.466
you couldn't defend
your mother.

15:00.883 --> 15:02.885
Now you compensate
by defending your mower.

15:02.885 --> 15:05.804
You confuse personal issue
s with technological.

15:06.305 --> 15:09.224
I have father issues, too,
but this is a good mower!

15:09.224 --> 15:10.526
[all agreeing]

15:10.893 --> 15:12.895
no, it's not.
And you know what?

15:12.895 --> 15:15.531
I'm willing to put my mone
y where my mouth is.

15:15.531 --> 15:18.534
I'll put up my $50,
less my expenses

15:19.034 --> 15:21.036
if you still
like the new mower

15:21.036 --> 15:22.738
after I've had my say.

15:22.738 --> 15:26.041
That works out
to over $7 apiece.

15:26.542 --> 15:28.544
Put on your tap shoes,
shirley.

15:28.961 --> 15:30.462
[moaning]

15:36.302 --> 15:38.170
wait till dad sees this!

15:39.588 --> 15:41.006
[both grunting]

15:41.006 --> 15:43.008
i'm sorry about
all those things

15:43.008 --> 15:45.394
cotton said about you.
It doesn't mean anything.

15:45.894 --> 15:47.646
He just doesn't like you.

15:47.646 --> 15:49.648
Oh, I wouldn't min
d cotton's rantings

15:49.648 --> 15:51.650
if hank would
just stick up for me.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.602
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

15:53.602 --> 15:55.738
hank doesn't
stick up for me either,

15:55.738 --> 15:57.022
his own stepmother.

15:58.273 --> 15:59.274
k
Now you folks thin

15:59.775 --> 16:02.077
that just because
this mower is new,
it's improved.

16:02.077 --> 16:04.330
So we should just get rid
of the old one, right?

16:04.330 --> 16:06.198
That's about
the size of it there.

16:06.198 --> 16:07.199
[all agreeing]

16:07.199 --> 16:08.334
well, hold on
for a second.

16:08.334 --> 16:11.337
A lot of great things
in life are old.

16:11.337 --> 16:14.423
Like old glory,
old faithful, old testament.

16:14.790 --> 16:16.291
"thou shalt not kill."

16:16.291 --> 16:19.762
Just because a baptism
turns into a little drowning.

16:19.762 --> 16:21.797
Everybody's
gotta blame somebody.

16:22.297 --> 16:23.799
Reverend,
that's an awful thing.

16:23.799 --> 16:25.467
Can I--
Can I ask you a question?

16:25.467 --> 16:27.219
What kind of car
do you drive?

16:27.219 --> 16:28.604
Mitsubishi diamante.

16:28.604 --> 16:30.556
Hank, if you're
just about through here,

16:30.556 --> 16:33.058
i'd like to take
the good reverend
over to the lot,

16:33.058 --> 16:37.062
put him behind the wheel
of a brand-new pre-owned sonata.

16:37.563 --> 16:39.148
I'm not through
here yet, lane.

16:39.148 --> 16:40.649
Let me ask you this:

16:40.649 --> 16:41.900
you'd buy this mower, right,

16:42.234 --> 16:43.736
with all the bells
and whistles?

16:44.236 --> 16:45.320
Well, hell, yeah.

16:45.821 --> 16:48.824
So you'd be the one
payin' all that dealer mark-up, right?

16:48.824 --> 16:49.825
You'd be just like me.

16:50.325 --> 16:52.828
Whoa-ho! Hey now, hondo.
Just a second here.

16:53.328 --> 16:55.164
Those god-dang
mason sons of bitches.

16:55.164 --> 16:56.465
I'm changin' my vote.

16:56.915 --> 16:58.917
All right, then. We're making
some progress here.

16:58.917 --> 17:02.337
Now, boomhauer,you like that fancy
electronic seat warmer,

17:02.337 --> 17:03.505
don't you? yo.

17:03.505 --> 17:06.008
It sounds like a good thing,
i'll give you that.

17:06.008 --> 17:09.428
But when you ride your mower,
where do you keep your beer?

17:09.845 --> 17:12.146
man,I plant that dang old beer
right between the legs, man.

17:12.513 --> 17:14.516
Between his legs.

17:14.516 --> 17:17.519
In other words,
this electronic seat warmer

17:17.519 --> 17:20.439
is heating up more
than just boomhauer's can.

17:20.439 --> 17:23.442
It's also heating up
his can of beer.

17:23.442 --> 17:25.444
Man, I don't want warm beer

17:25.444 --> 17:27.945
like that dang old
euro trash, man,

17:27.945 --> 17:29.448
drinking that
old warm crap.

17:29.448 --> 17:31.533
All right,boomhauer's on board.

17:32.367 --> 17:34.286
That makes 3 of us

17:34.286 --> 17:36.288
you'll never sway me.

17:36.288 --> 17:39.291
I am unswayable.

17:39.291 --> 17:41.293
I'd be a little more
impressed with you, dale

17:41.794 --> 17:44.797
if you didn't have chocolate chip crumbs
all over your eyebrows

17:44.797 --> 17:45.798
no way.

17:46.298 --> 17:47.433
See for yourself.

17:49.017 --> 17:50.602
Hey, you're right.

17:51.553 --> 17:52.554
[exclaiming]

17:52.554 --> 17:54.306
who--who--
Who are those people?

17:54.306 --> 17:57.309
Oh, those are just people
sent here to monitor your thoughts and opinions

17:57.309 --> 17:58.560
to learn how you think

17:58.560 --> 17:59.978
you know,get inside your head.

18:00.479 --> 18:01.396
[screaming]

18:02.898 --> 18:04.566
that's 4.

18:04.566 --> 18:06.318
[machine whirring]

18:09.905 --> 18:11.907
all right. I--I think
I've got enough

18:11.907 --> 18:13.325
positive and negative comments

18:13.325 --> 18:15.627
to put together
a very positive report.

18:15.911 --> 18:17.079
Not so fast.

18:17.246 --> 18:19.248
I've still got 30 minutes.

18:28.257 --> 18:30.259
...and taiwan
won't be far behind.

18:30.259 --> 18:31.260
[sighs]

18:31.260 --> 18:32.561
and 2nd--

18:32.561 --> 18:35.848
Rock the casbah,
rock the casbah ?

18:35.848 --> 18:38.350
Shareef don't like it ??

18:38.851 --> 18:39.852
[groaning]

18:39.852 --> 18:41.854
[all laughing]

18:42.855 --> 18:44.356
that's it.

18:44.356 --> 18:46.859
This is a zero-turning-radius
mower, is it not?

18:46.859 --> 18:48.360
It has a rear bag option,

18:48.861 --> 18:51.113
and it's made of ultra-light
space-age materials.

18:51.113 --> 18:53.916
Now, taken alone,each of those things
might be good.

18:54.416 --> 18:56.919
But combined, they're
a prescription for terror.

18:56.919 --> 18:59.171
I don't see or like
where this is going.

18:59.538 --> 19:00.372
Reverend hubert--

19:00.372 --> 19:02.374
I didn't drown that boy.

19:02.374 --> 19:06.011
Would you do me the honor
of getting on the mower?

19:06.011 --> 19:07.513
Now drive to the wall

19:07.513 --> 19:10.015
and execute
a 180-degree turn.

19:12.684 --> 19:15.020
Now engage
the zero turning radius.

19:16.355 --> 19:17.806
[screaming]

19:21.527 --> 19:24.863
that could have been me.
I hate this mower!

19:24.863 --> 19:26.698
(hank)
there's your
space-age polymers.

19:26.698 --> 19:29.151
There's your
zero turning radius.

19:29.151 --> 19:31.820
There's your rear bag option.

19:33.455 --> 19:35.657
My cup holder!

19:35.657 --> 19:37.159
Oh, now I know

19:37.159 --> 19:39.661
why you're always
speaking for me, hank.

19:39.661 --> 19:41.663
'cause I'm never right
and you always are.

19:42.164 --> 19:44.166
You know, bill, if I'm
always speaking for you,

19:44.166 --> 19:45.667
and I'm always right,

19:46.168 --> 19:48.670
that means you're always right,
too, doesn't it?

19:48.670 --> 19:50.172
Well, uh...

19:50.672 --> 19:51.673
[whispering]
it does.

19:51.673 --> 19:54.176
I-it does. It does!

19:54.676 --> 19:57.012
How do you like that?
I'm always right!

19:57.012 --> 19:59.731
That's everybody
but one.

19:59.731 --> 20:03.235
Preacher, if you're still
in the baptizing business,

20:03.735 --> 20:07.022
i'd like you
to drown my boy hank.

20:07.022 --> 20:10.025
They said the ladies' room
was the 2nd door on the right,

20:10.025 --> 20:12.277
so this must be it.

20:14.363 --> 20:16.164
(cotton)
i'll tell you
who gets my vote.

20:16.665 --> 20:17.666
The guy who figures out a way

20:18.166 --> 20:20.168
to strap an old woman
on an old mower

20:20.168 --> 20:22.754
and run 'em both
off a cliff.

20:22.754 --> 20:26.258
Oh, he's doing it again,
and in public.

20:26.758 --> 20:29.261
Don't get me wrong,
mr. Kahn.

20:29.261 --> 20:31.263
I like a woman
with a big butt.

20:31.263 --> 20:33.632
But tilly was taking advantage
of the situation.

20:34.933 --> 20:36.602
All right,I've had enough, dad.

20:36.602 --> 20:38.437
Don't you talk to me
like that, boy.

20:38.437 --> 20:39.805
I'll tell you
when you've had enough

20:39.805 --> 20:42.808
no, dad.
My mower is not too old,

20:42.808 --> 20:44.559
and my mom
was not too old.

20:44.559 --> 20:46.361
But this isn't
about my mom,

20:46.361 --> 20:47.863
and it's certainly
not about my mower.

20:48.363 --> 20:50.115
It's about
a bitter old man

20:50.115 --> 20:51.617
who blames everybody
but himself

20:52.117 --> 20:53.118
for all his own problems.

20:53.619 --> 20:55.621
And if you ever
talk about my mom

20:55.621 --> 20:57.623
or my mower
like that again,

20:57.623 --> 20:59.992
you're not welcome
in my house.

21:00.492 --> 21:02.044
Amen.

21:02.044 --> 21:03.545
[gasps]

21:04.046 --> 21:05.797
you've got
a fat neck, boy.

21:08.133 --> 21:10.919
Well, I'm not sure
if there is a god

21:10.919 --> 21:12.921
or a heaven,

21:12.921 --> 21:14.473
but one thing
I can tell you

21:14.473 --> 21:16.258
is your daddy's
going to hell.

21:18.343 --> 21:20.729
Hello, son.
How was the focus group?

21:21.179 --> 21:23.181
Oh, not so great.

21:23.181 --> 21:25.183
And now I've gotta
do all my shopping

21:25.183 --> 21:27.769
have you thought about what
you want for christmas, mom

21:27.769 --> 21:30.105
I don't need anything
from you, hank.

21:30.105 --> 21:32.407
You've given me enough already

21:37.279 --> 21:38.280
[snoring]

21:44.836 --> 21:47.839
(hank)
I guess peggy got
a ride home with cotton.

21:47.839 --> 21:49.341
Humph. I'll be dipped!

22:25.577 --> 22:26.628
(cotton)
pump jockey!

22:26.628 --> 22:27.629
(hank)
I am not--

22:27.629 --> 22:28.413
Works for tips.
