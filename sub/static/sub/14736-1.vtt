have had ears in their butts.

connecting two
traversable points
in Einsteinian space-time.

09:29.279 --> 09:31.952
I was paying attention.

09:31.952 --> 09:35.365
Sorry, you can't open
a time rift.
It's not possible.

09:35.365 --> 09:37.077
It's not?

09:37.077 --> 09:40.000

the bus for granted?

10:18.498 --> 10:22.002
A kid used my sleeve
as a tissue. So, no.

10:23.293 --> 10:24.875
What if Mr. Doyle
is right?

10:24.875 --> 10:28.008
What if Daisy is trapped
in this time forever?

10:28.008 --> 10:29.629
Maybe Barry's figured out
how to open the rift.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.172
You think Barry's
figured it out?
That would be terrible.

But isn't the most
important thing that
we get Daisy back?

10:34.715 --> 10:36.887
No, the most important thing
is that we get Daisy back.

10:36.887 --> 10:40.681
By "we" do you mean "us"?
 Well, I don't mean "them."

10:40.681 --> 10:43.023
I'm gonna go make sure
that Barry hasn't
opened the time rift yet.

10:46.767 --> 10:48.318

You know,
my mother used to say,

10:54.074 --> 10:56.536
"If I weren't the Queen
and you weren't a princess,

10:56.536 --> 10:58.448
"I'd stick you
in a catapult and..."

10:58.448 --> 10:59.870
I'm sorry, what?

10:59.870 --> 11:02.372
I said,
"You two are so nice.

11:02.372 --> 11:03.663
"I feel as if I'm always..."

11:03.663 --> 11:06.837
No, no, no.
You're a princess?

11:07.838 --> 11:10.590
Yes, I am.

11:10.590 --> 11:13.343
Wow, I've never met
a princess before.

11:13.343 --> 11:15.886
Not quite sure what to do.
Should I kneel?
Should you kneel?

11:15.886 --> 11:20.060
Why would I kneel?
 I don't know, I've never met
a princess before!

11:20.060 --> 11:22.352
Just do whatever
you would normally do.

11:22.352 --> 11:24.725
I guess normally after school,
I'd dive into the fridge

11:24.725 --> 11:26.476
for a little snack.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.902
You have a box of winter
that you store your food in?

11:31.902 --> 11:35.906
I like to call it
my stomach's waiting room.
You hungry?

11:35.906 --> 11:38.238
Well, I am a bit peckish.

11:38.238 --> 11:40.490
Do you have any
yonderberry bread?

11:40.490 --> 11:42.082
What's yonderberry bread?

11:42.082 --> 11:45.085
It's like a Scrimpton trifle
but bloodier.

11:46.416 --> 11:49.089
Man, you guys ate
some weird stuff.

11:49.089 --> 11:52.092
Now come on, help me crumple
these cupcakes on top of
this spaghetti.

11:59.760 --> 12:03.053
Renaldo, I was able to
sneak into the university's
particle accelerator

12:03.053 --> 12:05.806
and whip up a batch of
high-energy plasma.

12:05.806 --> 12:07.848
How did you get past
the security guard?

12:07.848 --> 12:10.110
With this clever disguise.

12:10.851 --> 12:11.942
"University student"?

12:11.942 --> 12:14.484
Also, he was asleep.

12:14.484 --> 12:17.447
This should be close enough
to tachyons to open
a time rift.

12:17.447 --> 12:19.619
Finally, I will
have my moment.

12:19.619 --> 12:20.951
Let's do this.

12:32.002 --> 12:34.004
Aw, shuds.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.675
Look on
the bright side, Barry.

12:35.675 --> 12:38.008
You don't have to
worry about losing
your keys!

12:39.970 --> 12:41.842
So, how's it going?
Feeling good?

12:41.842 --> 12:44.644
Having fun?
Open any time rifts?

12:44.644 --> 12:45.976
Renaldo, say nothing.

12:45.976 --> 12:48.308
She's trying to gather
intelligence from us.

12:48.308 --> 12:52.692
Don't worry, Barry.
She won't get any from me.

12:52.692 --> 12:55.395
Doesn't look like you guys
are having too much luck
in here.

12:55.395 --> 12:56.656
What makes you say that?

12:56.656 --> 12:58.949
Naldo just sent me
an invite to Don's funeral.

12:58.949 --> 13:00.780
I'll be needing a plus-two.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.953
Plus-two!
So Daisy's still with you!

13:02.953 --> 13:04.454
You haven't figured out
the time rift either!

13:04.454 --> 13:06.666
But we will.
Before you do.

13:06.666 --> 13:08.708
Shelby, wait!
For Don's memorial,

13:08.708 --> 13:10.080
would you sing
my favorite song?

13:10.080 --> 13:12.672
Shouldn't I sing
Don's favorite song?

13:12.672 --> 13:16.626
Shelby, Don's not real.
You do know that, right?

13:19.759 --> 13:25.135
Mmm. People in your time
must be so thankful
for "snack cakes."

13:25.135 --> 13:27.978
We are. So thankful.

13:31.021 --> 13:34.024
So what's it like
to be a princess.
Is it amazing?

13:34.024 --> 13:39.029
It is! Well, it was.
Before...

13:39.609 --> 13:42.202
Before what?

13:42.202 --> 13:46.786
My mother and father were
forever going on journeys
in search of adventure.

13:46.786 --> 13:51.161
But on the eve of
my 12th birthday,

13:51.161 --> 13:55.045
word reached the castle
that their ship had been
lost at sea.

13:55.045 --> 13:58.718
Now, I am the sole heir
to the kingdom.

13:58.718 --> 14:03.303
Daisy, I'm so sorry
about your parents.

14:03.303 --> 14:06.636
It's all right.
I can see a statue of them
from my window.

14:06.636 --> 14:08.728
It's like they're still
here with me.

14:08.728 --> 14:12.182
But covered in bird poop.

14:12.182 --> 14:15.976
My parents loved adventure,
and now I'm having
an adventure.

14:15.976 --> 14:18.899
I've felt closer to them
today than I have
in a long time.

14:20.690 --> 14:22.532
Good news!

14:22.532 --> 14:24.654
Barry's no closer to
sending Daisy back
than we are.

14:24.654 --> 14:28.368
You know, when I say it
out loud, it does not
sound like good news.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.580
So, what's going on here?

14:30.580 --> 14:34.164
Cyd is teaching me the joys
of unbaked baked goods.

14:37.087 --> 14:39.589
(LAUGHING) It's even funnier
because she's a princess.

14:39.589 --> 14:40.760
(BOTH LAUGHING)

14:40.760 --> 14:42.262
She's a what now?

14:50.600 --> 14:53.723
I can't believe Daisy
is an actual princess!

14:53.723 --> 14:55.936
Like a princess-princess!
Cyd, I'm so nervous.

14:55.936 --> 14:58.278
How do I usually stand?
Is it like this?

15:00.230 --> 15:03.113
Shelby, calm down.

15:03.113 --> 15:05.905
Daisy's gonna be back
any second. Don't get weird.

15:08.828 --> 15:12.792
Your rainbox is a miracle!

15:12.792 --> 15:15.295
But I'm a bit confused
by "shampoo."

15:15.295 --> 15:18.208
It smells like fruit,
but it does not taste
like fruit.

15:19.539 --> 15:22.172
My deepest apologies,
Your Majesty.

15:22.172 --> 15:27.217
The batter of the uncook-ed
cake doth stain
thy tunic mightily.

15:27.217 --> 15:30.140
Also, mine mother
usually handleth
the laundry.

15:32.312 --> 15:35.105
Way to not get weird.

15:35.105 --> 15:36.436
Why don't you borrow
some of our clothes?

15:36.436 --> 15:37.978
Pick out whatever you want.

15:37.978 --> 15:41.821
Really? No one's ever
let me choose
my own clothes before.

15:41.821 --> 15:45.325
Daisy, it's the 21st century.
Pick something that's you.

15:47.277 --> 15:49.329
So? What do you think?

15:49.329 --> 15:50.450
Cute!
 Lookin' good!

15:52.702 --> 15:54.704
Is she wearing
our toilet seat cover
as a hat?

15:54.704 --> 15:58.338
Or have we had a hat
on our toilet seat
this whole time?

15:59.499 --> 16:01.711
Either way,
she's really pulling it off.

16:07.387 --> 16:09.849
Renaldo, I've recreated
your homemade hair gel

16:09.849 --> 16:11.891
that gave the girls
the power to time travel.

16:11.891 --> 16:13.473
This looks nothing
like my hair gel.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.185
Fine. But it's sticky,
it's in a beaker

16:15.185 --> 16:16.856
and we're gonna blast it
with the laser

16:16.856 --> 16:18.358
'cause I'm gonna have
my moment even if
it kills us!

16:18.358 --> 16:20.190
Even if it what?
 Goggles on!

16:27.867 --> 16:30.160
Um, Barry?
 It's working!

16:30.160 --> 16:31.491
I can feel it!

16:31.491 --> 16:34.114
Nope, that's just my hands
on your waist. Out we go!

16:34.114 --> 16:35.705
My moment!

16:50.390 --> 16:51.721
I lost my lab!

16:52.802 --> 16:55.305
I lost my hat!

16:55.305 --> 16:57.016
Oh, wait, there it is.

17:03.773 --> 17:06.236
I can't believe
this happened.

17:06.236 --> 17:08.278
I can't believe
it didn't happen sooner.

17:10.069 --> 17:12.571
It's just a minor setback.
I'll rebuild the RV.

17:12.571 --> 17:15.454
(STAMMERS) It's just like
a giant jigsaw puzzle.

17:15.454 --> 17:18.417
Renaldo, you gather
all the debris
with flat edges,

17:18.417 --> 17:22.082
and I'll get some
rubber cement and a giant
coffee table.

17:22.082 --> 17:23.963
(CRYING)

17:23.963 --> 17:26.376
Barry, you can't
rebuild the RV.

17:26.376 --> 17:28.968
That is exactly what someone
who's trying to steal
my moment would say!

17:30.130 --> 17:31.551
Well, I got a new theory.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.593
All I need is a lab

17:33.593 --> 17:37.597
and something
with a similar chemical
composition to tachyons.

17:37.597 --> 17:41.441
Of course!
Polypeptides suspended
in a lactic acid enzyme.

17:41.441 --> 17:44.104
What the heck is that?
 Processed cheese sauce!

17:45.235 --> 17:47.817
What? I know stuff!

17:49.319 --> 17:51.321
About processed cheese.

17:52.742 --> 17:55.785
To the school cafeteria!

17:55.785 --> 17:57.457
If he gets to the school
before us,

17:57.457 --> 17:59.159
he could open the rift first!

18:00.790 --> 18:02.622
This is the craziest day
I've ever had.

18:02.622 --> 18:04.164
And I've been to
a Viking wedding.

18:11.921 --> 18:16.136
I hate chasing him.
But I love watching him run.
It's hilarious.

18:18.138 --> 18:21.141
Mr. Doyle! Permission to
use your lab?

18:21.141 --> 18:24.224
Go for it. My mom's
making me move
back home anyway.

18:24.224 --> 18:27.397
Hey, you were right.
First she kicks you out,
then she pulls you back in.

18:27.397 --> 18:30.730
Yeah, me and Ma are like
Newton's Third Law.

18:30.730 --> 18:34.154
"For every action,
there's an equal
and opposite reaction!"

18:34.154 --> 18:36.826
If Newton was talking about
a codependent man-child

18:36.826 --> 18:39.789
and an old lady
with flaky skin
in a hard to reach place.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.332
ALL: Ew.

18:43.333 --> 18:44.454
Okay then.

18:47.086 --> 18:50.840
Kicks him out
and pulls him back in...

18:50.840 --> 18:53.173
What if the rift is like
Mr. Doyle and his mother?

18:53.173 --> 18:54.344
What do you mean?

18:54.344 --> 18:57.056
Since the rift opened
to let Daisy out,

18:57.056 --> 18:59.179
maybe it will re-open
to let her back in.

18:59.179 --> 19:00.680
(SCOFFING)

19:00.680 --> 19:02.852
That's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.

19:02.852 --> 19:04.684
Now come, Renaldo,
we must stuff

19:04.684 --> 19:06.526
as much cheese
into our pants
as we can carry!

19:09.359 --> 19:12.732
I'm gonna go after him
because, um, I'm worried.

19:15.154 --> 19:18.408
Daisy, stand where
the rift first opened.

19:18.408 --> 19:20.119
If I'm right,
it will open again

19:20.119 --> 19:22.702
and we can send you home!
Isn't that great?

19:22.702 --> 19:25.625
Yes. But...

19:25.625 --> 19:27.877
Everything about your time
is so amazing.

19:27.877 --> 19:30.340
Today has been one of
the greatest adventures
of my life.

19:35.555 --> 19:37.717
The rift! It's back!
You were right!

19:39.219 --> 19:41.060
We're gonna
miss you, Daisy.

19:41.060 --> 19:42.762
I'm going to miss you, too.

19:42.762 --> 19:44.684
I don't have a lot of friends
where I come from.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.267
That sounds awful.

19:47.267 --> 19:48.728
It's not so bad.

19:48.728 --> 19:51.861
I have a room,
with a window,
and a door.

19:51.861 --> 19:53.233
I've never seen
the door open,

19:53.233 --> 19:55.074
but there's a slot
they shove my food through.

19:55.074 --> 19:57.487
And whoever does it,
has friendly-looking hands.

19:58.488 --> 20:02.782
Daisy, are you a prisoner?

20:02.782 --> 20:07.036
No, I'm a princess
who's being held against
her will in a tower.

20:07.036 --> 20:08.708
Oh, my heavens,
I'm a prisoner.

20:10.420 --> 20:13.092
We can't let you
go back there.

20:13.092 --> 20:16.546
But I must.
I have no choice.

20:16.546 --> 20:19.719
Yes you do.
You're in our time now.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.932
And in our time,
no one can tell you
what to do.

20:22.932 --> 20:25.935
Daisy, what do you want?

20:28.938 --> 20:30.560
I want to stay.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.902
Then get your royal highness
out of that rift!

20:35.114 --> 20:36.656
I can't move!

20:37.697 --> 20:39.238
What... What's happening?

20:39.238 --> 20:41.531
It's the rift!
It's trying to pull her
back through!

20:41.531 --> 20:42.662
Cyd, we have to help!

20:43.623 --> 20:45.455
(ALL GRUNTING)

20:46.286 --> 20:48.037
Shelby, it's too strong!

20:51.291 --> 20:52.712
Barry! Look!

20:53.963 --> 20:55.084
Guys! Help!

20:57.877 --> 21:01.761
You guys figured out
the rift? That was supposed
to be my moment!

21:01.761 --> 21:04.514
Barry, this is the only
moment that matters!

21:04.514 --> 21:06.516
Please, we can't do it
without you!

21:23.162 --> 21:25.535
(LAUGHING) We did it!

21:25.535 --> 21:26.826
Daisy, you're free!

21:26.826 --> 21:28.408
I don't know how to
thank you.

21:28.408 --> 21:32.792
I'd say "thank you."
That's how we do it in 2016.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.375
We couldn't have done it
without Barry's strength.

21:35.375 --> 21:39.419
Man, those words
taste weird in my mouth.

21:39.419 --> 21:42.181
Thank you, Barry.
I would've been banished
back to my time

21:42.181 --> 21:44.223
if you hadn't been
such a courageous hero.

21:45.475 --> 21:47.186
Don't let it go
to your head.

21:47.186 --> 21:50.229
In her time, "courageous hero"
probably means
"thin-wristed weenie."

21:50.229 --> 21:52.311
Cyd, stop ruining
my moment.

21:56.065 --> 21:57.987
Barry, we'd be happy
to jump back to

21:57.987 --> 22:01.361
before you blew up
your lab and stop you.
Just say the word.

22:01.361 --> 22:05.615
No, no. I must live
with the consequences
of my actions.

22:05.615 --> 22:08.287
I must also live with
the sweet new garage lab

22:08.287 --> 22:10.500
my parents built
with the insurance money.

22:11.661 --> 22:13.543
This place has everything!

22:13.543 --> 22:15.164
State-of-the-art
lab equipment,

22:15.164 --> 22:19.719
full virtual reality rig
and a 4K TV.

22:19.719 --> 22:22.131
It won't be easy Barry,
but in time,

22:22.131 --> 22:25.385
I'm sure you'll learn
to love this place.

22:25.385 --> 22:28.428
Did you know there's
a fully stocked
snack closet in there?

22:28.428 --> 22:30.560
This place is the bomb.
I'm never leaving.

22:30.560 --> 22:32.682
Shuds! I knew we
made it too good.

22:36.856 --> 22:40.650
I can't believe
Daisy's here.
In our time.

22:40.650 --> 22:42.692
Permanently.

22:42.692 --> 22:45.405
Yeah. Naldo, it's so cool
that your mom is letting
her live with you guys.

22:45.405 --> 22:47.246
Yeah, Mom's good that way.

22:47.246 --> 22:49.989
She's been letting me
crash at her place
since I was a baby.

22:51.911 --> 22:54.494
You know, Daisy stayed
because of you two.

22:54.494 --> 22:56.626
She's kind of
your responsibility.

22:56.626 --> 22:59.378
Please, Barry,
we're time travelers.

22:59.378 --> 23:02.422
I think we can handle
one princess.

23:02.422 --> 23:04.764
(GASPS) Look what I found!

23:06.466 --> 23:10.059
I used to live down
the road from this guy!

23:10.059 --> 23:13.272
Daisy, did you steal that
from the Portland Art Museum?

23:13.272 --> 23:17.146
No, this painting
has been in my family
for generations.

23:17.146 --> 23:19.729
Which is what I tried to
explain to that man
in the uniform

23:19.729 --> 23:21.861
who chased me after
the loud bells went off.

23:21.861 --> 23:24.524
BOTH: She stole it.

23:24.524 --> 23:26.826
Sorry, I'm afraid I still
have a lot to learn

23:26.826 --> 23:28.367
about living in your time.

23:28.367 --> 23:30.530
Well, don't worry,
'cause we got your back.

23:30.530 --> 23:31.701
What's on my back?

23:31.701 --> 23:34.333
Nothing. 'Cause we got it.

23:34.333 --> 23:36.295
I still don't get it.

23:43.342 --> 23:44.844
(BOTH GASP)

23:44.844 --> 23:46.005
(WHIMPERS)

23:50.259 --> 23:52.311
Why did we just
jump there?

23:52.311 --> 23:54.263
I have no idea.

23:55.305 --> 24:01.153
