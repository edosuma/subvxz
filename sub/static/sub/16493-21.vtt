[Diogee barks]

00:51.667 --> 00:53.291
-Hi, Dad.
-Hi, honey.

00:53.375 --> 00:56.083
I can't figure out what's wrong with
this... [grunts]

00:57.709 --> 01:00.250
-And hello, Milo.
-Hi, Mr. Chase!

01:00.333 --> 01:02.500
Dad, we're going to go get some ice cream.
You wanna go?

01:02.583 --> 01:04.625
Well, I'd love to,
but I gotta take this baby

01:04.709 --> 01:06.291
down to the Fire Truck
Museum today.

01:06.375 --> 01:08.125
You mean the museum
that nobody goes to?

01:08.208 --> 01:09.625
Well, when kids get
a load of Denise here,

01:09.709 --> 01:11.542
it should really
boost attendance!

01:11.625 --> 01:14.333
You know, Dad, the Natural History Museum
is right across the street

01:14.417 --> 01:16.458
and they have
a full size T-Rex.

01:16.542 --> 01:18.625
Who's gonna get excited about
an antique red truck?

01:18.709 --> 01:20.291
I can't believe it!

01:20.375 --> 01:23.500
Melissa, this is a 1901 Vandervert
Douse Master 4!

01:23.583 --> 01:26.750
This has dozens of unique innovations
for fighting fires!

01:26.834 --> 01:29.166
For example, the water tank back here
has a wind turbine

01:29.250 --> 01:30.709
that spins
while you're driving,

01:30.792 --> 01:31.792
that way
when they got there

01:31.875 --> 01:33.166
they'd have enough pressure
to shoot the water

01:33.250 --> 01:35.208
all the way
up to the third story!

01:35.792 --> 01:37.000
Wowee!

01:37.083 --> 01:39.458
There's a pneumatic secondary braking
system on the back,

01:39.542 --> 01:42.709
the first ever ladder that was actually
attached to the top of a truck,

01:42.792 --> 01:45.792
and look, the bell has a little string
so you can ring it by hand...

01:45.875 --> 01:49.166
I... I guess that's
not as impressive as the rest of it,

01:49.250 --> 01:51.792
but over here,
it has an in-dash radio!

01:51.875 --> 01:53.583
And radios
weren't even invented yet!

01:53.667 --> 01:55.583
And this truck also has
the distinction of being

01:55.667 --> 01:58.083
the first ever to have
a Dalmatian as a mascot.

01:58.166 --> 01:59.834
In fact, they had a little place
for him to ride

01:59.917 --> 02:01.208
right over here
and he...

02:01.291 --> 02:03.041
Diogee?
How'd you get in there?

02:03.125 --> 02:05.750
-And where'd you get these spots?
-I'm impressed, Milo.

02:05.834 --> 02:08.041
How do you know so much about
antique fire engines?

02:08.125 --> 02:10.667
Are you kidding? It was a truck like this
that saved my grandfather

02:10.750 --> 02:13.375
after he accidentally
ate all those balloons.

02:13.458 --> 02:15.583
Well, Dad, since Milo's
so excited about it,

02:15.667 --> 02:16.834
I guess we'll
ride down with you.

02:16.917 --> 02:19.542
-Whoa. Whoa. I don't know about Milo.
- What do you mean?

02:19.667 --> 02:22.792
Well, the museum is filled with
breakable antiques...

02:22.875 --> 02:24.750
Come on, Dad,
he's such a fan.

02:24.834 --> 02:26.417
It'd mean
so much to him!

02:26.500 --> 02:27.917
-Apparently.
-Oh...

02:28.000 --> 02:29.709
[clicks tongue] Okay.

02:29.792 --> 02:32.458
-Whaddya say, Milo?
-[imitates siren]

02:32.542 --> 02:36.333
Yeah, where's that fire?
It's out there, buddy! [imitates siren]

02:36.417 --> 02:38.208
Wait, hey, Mr. Chase,
can I drive?

02:38.291 --> 02:39.542
No.

02:39.625 --> 02:41.709
[Dakota] Well, we got the pistachios,
now what?

02:41.792 --> 02:43.583
Well, we then have
to get them to the safe house,

02:43.667 --> 02:46.250
which should be easy
once we locate our new vehicle!

02:46.333 --> 02:49.250
It's supposed to be
parked right out here somewhere...

02:49.333 --> 02:51.667
Oh, a new vehicle!
We're coming up in the world.

02:51.750 --> 02:54.875
It's about time, too,
considering what they gave us last time.

02:54.959 --> 02:56.417
I hope it's fast!

02:56.500 --> 02:59.500
I hope it's red!
Let's see now...

03:00.208 --> 03:03.709
[beeping]

03:06.000 --> 03:07.834
[groans]
Well, it is red.

03:07.917 --> 03:10.709
It's like they're going
out of their way to humiliate us!

03:10.792 --> 03:12.250
Oh, come on,
it's a tandem!

03:12.333 --> 03:14.458
It's like a bike,
riding another bike!

03:16.917 --> 03:18.667
All righty.

03:18.750 --> 03:22.875
So, we wait till traffic clears,
look left, then right, then...

03:22.959 --> 03:28.250
Then we look left again,
and safely pull out into traffic.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.709
Why is he narrating?

03:29.792 --> 03:31.792
He's laying down
a foundation for when I learn...

03:31.875 --> 03:34.375
I'm laying down a foundation for when
she learns to drive.

03:34.458 --> 03:35.458
Signaling.

03:35.542 --> 03:36.834
Oh, this is
very exciting!

03:36.917 --> 03:38.834
Milo, check out
the wind turbine.

03:39.834 --> 03:41.458
[Milo] Wowee!
Look at her go!

03:41.542 --> 03:42.625
Pretty impressive, huh?

03:42.709 --> 03:46.000
And we're only going
one eighth of a furlong per jiffy.

03:46.083 --> 03:48.458
That's only 17 miles an hour.

03:48.542 --> 03:51.542
Yeah, but back then they thought if you
went any faster than 35,

03:51.625 --> 03:52.792
your lungs would collapse.

03:52.875 --> 03:53.959
[scoffs]
That's ridiculous.

03:54.041 --> 03:56.875
Well, we can really test that theory
on this hill!

03:57.875 --> 03:59.834
[all screaming]

03:59.917 --> 04:03.750
Okay, well,
I'm gently applying the brake!

04:05.417 --> 04:07.625
[Milo screams]
Sorry, Elliot!

04:07.709 --> 04:11.250
Now I am trying to extricate my foot
from the floorboards.

04:11.333 --> 04:13.333
Dad, you can
stop narrating now.

04:13.417 --> 04:14.834
Maybe we can
radio for help.

04:14.917 --> 04:16.500
Hello? Hello?

04:16.583 --> 04:19.375
This is Milo Murphy.
We're on a runaway Douse Master 4.

04:19.458 --> 04:20.834
And we just went
over Harding Hill!

04:20.917 --> 04:23.709
Jumping bullfrogs,
your lungs will collapse!

04:23.792 --> 04:26.458
Hold on, young fellow!
I know exactly what to do!

04:27.000 --> 04:30.709
[playing ragtime]

04:30.792 --> 04:33.709
[bell ringing]

04:33.792 --> 04:35.709
Maybe we should
try something else.

04:37.083 --> 04:38.083
[ringing]

04:40.458 --> 04:42.500
[music continues]

04:43.375 --> 04:44.709

04:52.083 --> 04:53.041

05:04.959 --> 05:06.458
[people screaming]

05:06.542 --> 05:07.959
There you go,
all set! Hop on!

05:09.000 --> 05:10.458
[Milo] Oops! Sorry!

05:10.542 --> 05:11.583
It's that kid!

05:11.667 --> 05:13.583
See? See!
I was right!

05:13.667 --> 05:16.083
He's done it again,
he's ruined our mission!

05:16.166 --> 05:17.959
Oh, no!

05:18.041 --> 05:20.625
Hey, how 'bout if I pull
that secondary brake back there?

05:20.709 --> 05:23.375
Wait, Milo. No!
Get back here!

05:24.709 --> 05:25.709
[grunts]

05:42.625 --> 05:44.959
Hey, the brake must be working!
We're slowing down!

05:55.792 --> 05:56.959
Milo?

05:57.041 --> 05:58.125
Oh, hey, Mr. Chase!

06:02.625 --> 06:04.417
I think my lungs
just collapsed.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.125
Well, it's a good thing
we stopped before

06:06.208 --> 06:07.625
we ran into this
rail car diner!

06:07.709 --> 06:08.959
Milo, you're like

06:09.041 --> 06:11.083
whatever the opposite
of a rabbit's foot is.

06:11.166 --> 06:12.959
-A rabbit's head?
-A fox's foot?

06:13.041 --> 06:15.875
-A pound of sugar?
-No, you're just... [grunts]

06:16.000 --> 06:18.500
Dad! It's just Murphy's Law,
he can't help it.

06:18.583 --> 06:21.125
Besides, he just...
A pound of sugar, really?

06:21.208 --> 06:22.417
I was just riffing!

06:22.500 --> 06:25.125
Besides, he also just
saved us by thinking on his feet.

06:25.208 --> 06:26.875
Actually, I was sitting down
when I thought of it,

06:26.959 --> 06:28.333
so technically
I was thinking on my...

06:28.375 --> 06:31.667
If he wasn't here, we wouldn't need
saving! Sitting or otherwise!

06:31.750 --> 06:33.041
All right,
be nice, Dad.

06:33.125 --> 06:35.166
Does this Murphy's Law thing
have an off switch?

06:35.250 --> 06:36.834
I haven't
found one yet!

06:38.917 --> 06:40.500
Look, there they are!
They've stopped!

06:43.208 --> 06:45.625
Quickly, Dakota!
The game's afoot!

06:45.709 --> 06:47.875
"The game's afoot"?
Really?

06:47.959 --> 06:49.917
I don't think
anybody says that!

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
I just said that!

06:51.083 --> 06:54.125
I know,
and it's mystifying me!

06:54.208 --> 06:56.125
Oh, we better hurry!
It looks like that tank's gonna blow!

06:56.917 --> 06:58.083
[screaming]

07:02.583 --> 07:04.000
[screaming]

07:04.083 --> 07:07.125
Oh, this chassis
was not made for jet propulsion!

07:07.208 --> 07:09.417
I want to know
who he's working for!

07:09.500 --> 07:11.041
Hey, Dad, we're moving!

07:11.125 --> 07:13.542
That's no excuse, you still gotta
eat your vegetables.

07:13.625 --> 07:14.875
-Coming through!
-Sorry.

07:14.959 --> 07:16.166
-[Cavendish] Pardon!
-[Dakota] Excuse me, sorry.

07:18.250 --> 07:20.000
So, you gonna
finish that?

07:29.709 --> 07:31.125
Now there's something
you don't often see,

07:31.208 --> 07:34.125
a wheel of giant corndogs
passing you on the street.

07:34.208 --> 07:37.208
Yeah, and we must be going at least
five furlongs per jiffy.

07:37.291 --> 07:41.542
Oh, hey, it's you two guys!
Uh, the pistachio guys!

07:41.625 --> 07:42.959
How are you?

07:43.041 --> 07:45.834
How we are is none of your concern!
Now, tell us!

07:45.917 --> 07:46.917
Who are you working for?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.875
The Black Radish Underground?
The Marmoset League?

07:49.959 --> 07:51.583
[woman screaming]

07:53.709 --> 07:56.041
[cats yowling]

07:56.125 --> 07:57.709
Uh-oh. Excuse me!

07:57.792 --> 07:59.000
All right,
see ya later.

07:59.083 --> 08:01.208
Don't tell him
you'll see him later.

08:01.291 --> 08:02.792
[Dakota] What?
I'm just being nice.

08:06.542 --> 08:08.250
[cats screaming]

08:16.792 --> 08:18.834
[residents] Aw!

08:18.917 --> 08:22.875
So he's a rogue time agent out to destroy
us by saving kittens?

08:22.959 --> 08:24.000
He can do both!

08:24.083 --> 08:27.792
Oh, hey, a kitty!
Hey! He looks kinda like you!

08:29.041 --> 08:30.625
He does not look like me!

08:30.709 --> 08:32.667
[imitates Cavendish]

08:36.750 --> 08:38.625
[both yelling]

08:40.291 --> 08:44.000
[grunting and groaning]

08:45.375 --> 08:46.417
Ow!

08:50.875 --> 08:52.291
Dad! The roof came off!

08:52.375 --> 08:54.041
You still gotta eat
your vegetables.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.542
-[daughter] Dad!
-[father] Vegetables!

09:06.250 --> 09:10.250
And now we're dragging
the top of an old diner.

09:10.333 --> 09:12.166
Well, that was exciting.
Are you guys okay?

09:12.250 --> 09:14.792
-Is this a game to you?
-A game?

09:14.875 --> 09:17.083
No, I mean how
would you keep score?

09:18.083 --> 09:19.041
[yells]

09:19.125 --> 09:21.250
I got you!
There you go!

09:21.333 --> 09:23.250
Hey, listen, it's gonna
get bumpy up ahead,

09:23.333 --> 09:25.834
so I better drop you guys off
at Palm Lake Park.

09:25.917 --> 09:27.208
Okay, you
take care now!

09:27.291 --> 09:28.959
Don't tell him
to take care!

09:29.041 --> 09:31.834
I am just being nice!

09:31.917 --> 09:33.917
There you go!
Have a nice afternoon!

09:34.333 --> 09:36.166
[screaming]

09:40.792 --> 09:42.709
That Murphy kid,
he saved us.

09:42.792 --> 09:44.291
He's like,
he's like a hero!

09:44.375 --> 09:45.709
He's the villain.

09:45.792 --> 09:48.667
-I am the hero.
-[imitates Cavendish]

09:48.750 --> 09:50.208
Ah, ah? See?

09:50.291 --> 09:52.333
Mr. Chase,
I've got an idea!

09:52.417 --> 09:53.583
If we turn left on Reese,

09:53.667 --> 09:56.250
maybe the Natural History
Museum steps will slow us down!

09:56.333 --> 09:58.333
And maybe we'll get to see
that T-Rex!

09:58.417 --> 10:00.375
At this point, I'm willing
to try anything!

10:03.250 --> 10:06.083
[Richard] Well, big surprise.
We are not slowing down!

10:06.166 --> 10:07.375
[screaming]

10:12.792 --> 10:14.208
-Cool!
-Nice!

10:14.291 --> 10:16.625
Whoa!
Awesome! [chuckles]

10:16.709 --> 10:18.166
That sculpture is so cool,

10:18.250 --> 10:20.208
it makes me want to visit
the fire truck museum!

10:20.291 --> 10:22.291
[boy 1] So are fire trucks the reason
dinosaurs went extinct?

10:22.375 --> 10:24.834
[boy 2] Let's find out
by going inside and paying admission!

10:24.917 --> 10:26.417
-[boy 3] I wanna pay, too!
-[boy 4] Come on!

10:26.500 --> 10:28.875
Hey, we did get to see the T-Rex!
[giggles]

-Milo, y'know...

10:30.667 --> 10:32.291
...just spending
the day with you

10:32.375 --> 10:33.917
has given me
a new appreciation for...

10:34.000 --> 10:35.375
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Chase.

10:35.458 --> 10:37.333
Okay, Gus, we're all set at this end.
Thanks a lot.

10:37.417 --> 10:38.834
[sad music stops]

10:38.917 --> 10:40.250
No problem, sonny!

10:40.333 --> 10:41.375
You were saying?

10:41.458 --> 10:43.250
Well, what I was saying is,

10:43.333 --> 10:46.750
I think I have a new appreciation for you
and your... Condition.

Well said, Dad.

10:48.291 --> 10:51.083

I think I can relate.

10:51.166 --> 10:54.875
Part of my job is fighting an
uncontrollable element. Fire.

10:54.959 --> 10:58.667

10:58.750 --> 11:00.375
Not a wave of fire,

11:00.458 --> 11:02.250

don't actually exist.

11:02.333 --> 11:04.417
Well, actually,

11:04.500 --> 11:06.417
I'd quit

11:06.500 --> 11:08.834
♪ It's my world
And we're all livin' in it ♪
