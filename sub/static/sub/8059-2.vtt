00:01.976 --> 00:03.810
[Sighs]

00:03.844 --> 00:06.079
Knopey, my girl, what up?

00:06.113 --> 00:07.914
- I just farted.
- Oh, Jeremy.

00:07.948 --> 00:09.482
I truly thought that
I would never have

00:09.517 --> 00:10.517
to interact with you again.

00:10.551 --> 00:11.684
I missed you too.

00:11.719 --> 00:13.153
The city council is voting

00:13.187 --> 00:14.120
on whether to rezone

00:14.155 --> 00:16.088
the Newport land
for commercial use.

00:16.245 --> 00:19.381
If I win, stupid Gryzzl
and stupid Ron

00:19.415 --> 00:21.850
can't build anything there,
and then I'm sitting pretty.

00:21.884 --> 00:26.555
Sadly, the deciding vote
is from my old city council mate

00:26.589 --> 00:31.359
and human equivalent of
gas station Sushi, Jeremy Jamm.

00:31.394 --> 00:34.429
So I am here to talk to you
about why you should vote "No"

00:34.463 --> 00:35.830
- in the zoning issue--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:35.865 --> 00:37.165
Hold up, little chica.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.835
Before we go any further,
I need to ask my girlfriend

00:39.869 --> 00:40.936
how she wants me to vote.

00:40.970 --> 00:43.405
Why?
Who's your girlfriend?

00:43.439 --> 00:46.274
Hello, Leslie.

00:46.309 --> 00:47.342
Tammy!

00:47.376 --> 00:50.278

01:07.542 --> 01:10.432
Wow, Jamm and Tammy.
Jammy.

01:10.466 --> 01:12.134
- [Both laugh]
- Jammy.

01:12.168 --> 01:13.935
You guys are so cute.
When did you--

01:13.970 --> 01:17.572
why would either one of you,
uh, you know, why?

01:17.607 --> 01:18.707
Dear God, why?

01:18.741 --> 01:20.876
Hit it off at karaoke.

01:20.910 --> 01:23.345
She saw me nail
<i>Gangsta's Paradise.</i>

01:23.379 --> 01:25.280
- I saw her bite the door guy...
- [Chuckles]

01:25.314 --> 01:28.183
She then let me buy her
a bunch of purses,

01:28.217 --> 01:30.352
- and the rest is history.
- A bunch.

01:30.386 --> 01:32.053
Wait a second,
this is great news,

01:32.088 --> 01:34.289
because Ron is my opponent
in this,

01:34.323 --> 01:36.424
and you live to torture Ron.

01:36.459 --> 01:37.426
Vote for me

01:37.460 --> 01:38.994
so that you can screw Ron over.

01:39.028 --> 01:41.062
Maybe you're not
a blonde bimbo after all.

01:41.097 --> 01:43.131
- Thank you.
- Well, let me mull it over.

01:43.166 --> 01:45.500
Sure, I'm aligning myself
with terrible people,

01:45.535 --> 01:48.069
but think
of all the wonderful people

01:48.104 --> 01:50.105
who will benefit
from a national park!

01:50.139 --> 01:52.641
It's worth it,
and you can trust my opinion

01:52.675 --> 01:54.843
because I have a lot to gain
by being right,

01:54.877 --> 01:57.979
and I have severe tunnel vision
about achieving my goals.

01:58.014 --> 02:01.316
Joan, on behalf of the entire
city, congratulations.

02:01.350 --> 02:03.985
I do want to apologize for not
being able to accommodate

02:04.020 --> 02:05.287
- some of your requests.
- Oh.

02:05.321 --> 02:07.455
For example,
we couldn't get a bottle

02:07.490 --> 02:10.392
of Chateau Marmont
because it's a hotel

02:10.425 --> 02:12.527
in Los Angeles, not a wine.

02:12.562 --> 02:15.030
Well, did you at least get
buddy holly to sing?

02:15.064 --> 02:19.367
No, because he's been
famously dead for 60 years.

02:19.402 --> 02:21.002
- What?
- Hi, Joan.

02:21.037 --> 02:23.305
Hi, my name is April,
and I'm your biggest fan,

02:23.339 --> 02:24.439
- and I pretty much hate everyone.
- Oh.

02:24.473 --> 02:26.308
Will you sign
your ninth memoir for me?

02:26.342 --> 02:28.577
Well, it would be my pleasure.

02:28.611 --> 02:29.878
You said your name was Glenn?

02:29.912 --> 02:32.914
- Yes, I did.
- That's pretty.

02:32.949 --> 02:34.916
Joan has always been
kind of a train wreck,

02:34.951 --> 02:38.253
but the last three years,
she's gone off the deep end.

02:38.287 --> 02:40.555
She did a string of shows
from rehab.

02:40.590 --> 02:43.792
Victoria Herzog,
you were a successful attorney

02:43.826 --> 02:44.759
from Wilmington, Delaware.

02:44.794 --> 02:46.261
Then you hit rock bottom.

02:46.295 --> 02:47.963
This is supposed to be
anonymous.

02:47.997 --> 02:50.565
She once gave every member
in her audience a car.

02:50.600 --> 02:53.201
One car, that they all
had to fight for.

02:53.236 --> 02:54.936
Oh, and last year she did a show

02:54.971 --> 02:56.572
where she called
all of her ex-boyfriends

02:56.606 --> 02:58.106
while sitting
on a washing machine.

02:58.141 --> 02:59.875
Well, Erik,
if you didn't give it to me,

02:59.909 --> 03:01.176
then who did?

03:01.210 --> 03:03.078
I love her so much.

03:03.112 --> 03:05.847
I hope she's my real mom.

03:05.882 --> 03:08.083
"Entrepreneur-bachelor
Tom Haverford

03:08.117 --> 03:10.919
"is making quite a splash
in the culinary world.

03:10.953 --> 03:15.090
We expect even bigger things
from him in 2018."

03:15.124 --> 03:18.160
Tom, what does "culinary" mean?

03:18.194 --> 03:19.628
Means this is a cause
for celebration.

03:19.662 --> 03:21.696
Round of drinks for everyone
on the house.

03:21.731 --> 03:22.764
Yeah!

03:22.798 --> 03:24.199
Oh, let me also get
a chicken parm

03:24.233 --> 03:25.300
and a lasagna on the side.

03:25.334 --> 03:27.803
And a spaghetti to go.
On the house!

03:27.837 --> 03:30.205
Yes.
[Applause]

03:30.239 --> 03:31.439
[Groans]

03:31.474 --> 03:32.674
That's the fourth engagement
this month.

03:32.708 --> 03:35.043
I'm tired of being
an entrepreneur/bachelor.

03:35.077 --> 03:37.012
I need to find someone.

03:37.046 --> 03:39.147
Are you bummed, Tom?

03:39.182 --> 03:40.649
Hey, I got a quick fix for that.

03:40.683 --> 03:42.551
Let's get hammered.

03:42.585 --> 03:44.719
Everything here is free.

03:44.754 --> 03:46.888
Ron.

03:46.923 --> 03:50.959
Ms. Knope.
How's that $0 bid coming along?

03:50.993 --> 03:53.195
You know, in my experience
with capitalism,

03:53.229 --> 03:55.564
people normally expect money
in exchange

03:55.598 --> 03:57.032
for their goods and land.

03:57.066 --> 04:00.435
In my experience
with buttfaces, you are one.

04:00.469 --> 04:01.803
[Gavel bangs]

04:01.838 --> 04:04.072
We will now hear arguments
about the Newport property.

04:04.107 --> 04:07.409
First, on behalf of Gryzzl,
Mr. Ron Swanson.

04:07.443 --> 04:09.211
[Music plays]
Thank you, councilman.

04:09.245 --> 04:12.447
When you vote tomorrow,
we believe you should vote

04:12.482 --> 04:15.250
to rezone the land
for commercial use.

04:15.284 --> 04:18.286
Well, I'm convinced.
Tomorrow I'm voting for Gryzzl.

04:18.321 --> 04:19.454
What?

04:19.488 --> 04:21.423
I didn't even get a chance
to say my plan.

04:21.457 --> 04:23.225
Your plan?

04:23.259 --> 04:24.593
You know who else had a plan?

04:24.627 --> 04:25.760
Please don't say Hitler.

04:25.795 --> 04:28.230
- Adolf Hitler.
- [Sighs]

04:28.264 --> 04:29.698
I'm with Swanson.

04:29.732 --> 04:31.933
It's a stache thing.
Stache bros.

04:31.968 --> 04:33.568
You wouldn't understand.

04:33.603 --> 04:35.937
We're done here.

04:35.972 --> 04:38.306
Well, that was easy.

04:38.341 --> 04:39.875
What the hell just happened?

04:39.909 --> 04:40.942
[Applause]

04:40.977 --> 04:42.410
Thank you, Commissioner Gordon,

04:42.445 --> 04:43.478
people of Gotham.

04:43.513 --> 04:45.547
Okay, she thinks
she's in <i>Batman.</i>

04:45.581 --> 04:48.550
People often ask me,
"Joan, how do you do it?"

04:48.584 --> 04:50.452
It's simple.

04:50.486 --> 04:52.153
I love being on TV.

04:52.188 --> 04:53.889
I've known
what I've wanted to do

04:53.923 --> 04:55.424
since I was ten years old.

04:55.458 --> 04:58.560
That is the key
to living a good life.

04:58.594 --> 05:02.631
If you don't absolutely love
what you do with a true passion,

05:02.665 --> 05:04.766
then what's the point
in doing it at all?

05:04.801 --> 05:06.201
On a separate note,

05:06.235 --> 05:08.270
I think that America
should have a purge night.

05:08.304 --> 05:10.639
Let me explain why.

05:10.673 --> 05:13.875
Do I even like my job?

05:13.910 --> 05:16.711
I must be the first person ever

05:16.746 --> 05:20.148
to have money, power,
and notoriety

05:20.183 --> 05:22.784
- but still feel empty.
- [Scoffs]

05:22.819 --> 05:24.553
I need someone to share
my life with.

05:24.587 --> 05:28.924
What if your future wife is
somebody that you already know?

05:28.958 --> 05:31.860
Let's open your Gryzzl page.
[Beep]

05:31.894 --> 05:33.094
What about her?
She's cute.

05:33.129 --> 05:34.996
- Date her.
- That's my cousin.

05:35.031 --> 05:36.631
Oh. How about her?

05:36.666 --> 05:38.186
That's my dad!
What's wrong with you?

05:38.201 --> 05:39.234
I'm drunk, okay?

05:39.268 --> 05:41.069
Why are you only friends
with your family?

05:41.104 --> 05:42.137
Ooh, look,
you just got a message

05:42.171 --> 05:44.139
from somebody named Lucy
in Chicago.

05:44.173 --> 05:45.307
She looks familiar.

05:45.341 --> 05:47.008
Yeah, we used to date.
I was super into her.

05:47.043 --> 05:50.745
No, that's not it.
Was she in Destiny's Child?

05:50.780 --> 05:53.982
"Hey, Tom.
Saw the article, you boss!

05:54.016 --> 05:56.518
Let's catch up soon.
Miss you."

05:56.552 --> 05:59.120
[Chuckles]
Do you realize what's happening?

05:59.155 --> 06:00.489
We have been sitting here

06:00.523 --> 06:01.756
searching for your soul mate
this whole time,

06:01.791 --> 06:03.792
and then Lucy just
Gryzzl-texts you out of nowhere?

06:03.826 --> 06:05.227
It's a sign,
and we have to catch it.

06:05.261 --> 06:07.996
We are going to Chicago.

06:08.030 --> 06:11.533
Andy, think about what
you're saying right now,

06:11.567 --> 06:13.835
'cause it's the smartest idea
anyone's ever had.

06:13.870 --> 06:15.904
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

06:15.938 --> 06:18.173
Ron, what did you do?

06:18.207 --> 06:20.542
I delivered
a flawless presentation

06:20.576 --> 06:22.344
and secured tomorrow's vote.

06:22.378 --> 06:24.813
No, you got all sneaky
and snuck around

06:24.847 --> 06:26.214
and snooked that vote away
from me.

06:26.249 --> 06:29.651
And I know this because earlier
I sneaked and snooked around,

06:29.685 --> 06:31.553
and Jammy was supposed
to vote for me.

06:31.587 --> 06:34.122
The snooker has become
the snorked.

06:34.157 --> 06:37.793
What are you talking--
[Sniffs]

06:37.827 --> 06:39.461
She's near.

06:39.495 --> 06:40.896
Hey, Ron.

06:40.930 --> 06:42.030
Tammy.

06:42.064 --> 06:43.598
So you two are together now.

06:43.633 --> 06:46.334
- My condolences to both of you.
- Mm.

06:46.369 --> 06:47.469
You guys
were supposed to vote for me.

06:47.503 --> 06:50.205
Leslie, I would never
do anything to help you.

06:50.239 --> 06:52.007
You've always been
against me and Ron.

06:52.041 --> 06:54.209
You're a big part of the reason
that he and I aren't together

06:54.243 --> 06:56.378
and I had to settle
for this placeholder.

06:56.412 --> 06:58.179
- I love you so much.
- [Sighs]

06:58.214 --> 07:00.048
So you thought
if you voted for Ron,

07:00.082 --> 07:01.683
you could actually win him back?

07:01.717 --> 07:02.851
Yeah, that's right.

07:02.885 --> 07:04.286
Did it work, baby?

07:04.320 --> 07:07.055
Are you horny with gratitude?

07:07.090 --> 07:09.391
[Laughs]

07:09.425 --> 07:11.460
You two more than deserve
each other.

07:11.494 --> 07:14.096
Good luck.
[Whistles]

07:14.130 --> 07:15.697
The vote is tomorrow.

07:15.732 --> 07:18.099
If I don't get Jamm
out from Tammy's clutches,

07:18.134 --> 07:19.301
I'm doomed!

07:19.335 --> 07:21.369
It's like rescuing a bunny
from a lion,

07:21.404 --> 07:24.200
but that lion is
a demonic sociopath

07:24.320 --> 07:25.907
with really nice cleavage.

07:28.706 --> 07:30.374
All right, we're here.

07:30.408 --> 07:31.975
Sir, where the hell are we?

07:32.010 --> 07:33.243
Chicago.

07:33.278 --> 07:35.412
That'll be $830.

07:35.447 --> 07:36.446
- Oh, no.
- [Laughs]

07:36.481 --> 07:38.282
- This is so dumb.
- Awesome!

07:38.316 --> 07:40.076
Turn the car around.
We're going back home.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.118
No way.
Pay me.

07:41.152 --> 07:42.586
And get the hell out of my cab.

07:42.620 --> 07:44.555
Pay the man.

07:44.589 --> 07:47.424
Chicago!

07:47.459 --> 07:49.193
The Big Apple!

07:49.227 --> 07:51.261
- Well, that's where Lucy works.
- Yeah.

07:51.296 --> 07:52.763
Must have given the cabbie
the address.

07:52.797 --> 07:54.298
Let's just get something to eat
and fly home.

07:54.332 --> 07:56.066
What? No!
We came all this way.

07:56.101 --> 07:57.501
Tom, we should at least say hi.

07:57.535 --> 07:59.703
No. You can't not talk to
someone for five years and then

07:59.737 --> 08:02.439
show up unannounced where
they work in a different city.

08:02.474 --> 08:04.408
That's what murderers do
before they murder someone.

08:04.442 --> 08:05.509
Tom?

08:05.543 --> 08:07.077
I thought that was you.
What are you doing here?

08:07.112 --> 08:08.879
Oh, uh--

08:08.913 --> 08:10.781
You're not going
to murder me, are you?

08:10.815 --> 08:15.819
No.
I'm here doing stuff, um--

08:15.854 --> 08:17.921
Lucy, hey.
Andy Dwyer.

08:17.956 --> 08:19.423
- Remember me?
- Yeah.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.492
He's here helping me
find a place to live.

08:21.526 --> 08:23.093
I just got a job here,

08:23.128 --> 08:24.695
and then when you hit him up
on Gryzzl,

08:24.729 --> 08:26.463
he was like,
"Let's go say hi to Lucy

08:26.498 --> 08:28.832
since we're already here
in Chicago."

08:28.867 --> 08:30.200
Yeah.
That's the deal.

08:30.235 --> 08:31.568
Cool.
What job is it?

08:31.603 --> 08:33.604
Head coach of the Chicago Bulls.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.606
No, he's, uh,
working at a nonprofit.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.573
No, what?
Am I?

08:37.609 --> 08:39.042
Aw, that sucks.

08:39.077 --> 08:40.510
Well, um, listen,
I got some stuff I got to do

08:40.544 --> 08:42.179
in the office,
but I want to hang out.

08:42.212 --> 08:43.547
Do you want to meet me here
in, like, an hour?

08:43.581 --> 08:45.082
Yeah.
That sounds great.

08:45.116 --> 08:46.083
We'll, uh, got get a little

08:46.117 --> 08:47.518
[Chicago accent]
Chicago deep dish pizza

08:47.552 --> 08:49.052
- and go watch the Bears.
- No.

08:49.087 --> 08:50.721
[Normal voice]
I'm sorry I started doing that.

08:50.755 --> 08:54.124
[Humming]

08:54.159 --> 08:55.092
Hey, April.
How's it going?

08:55.126 --> 08:56.226
Fine.

08:56.261 --> 08:58.529
Except hearing Joan
talk about her passion

08:58.563 --> 08:59.763
and doing what you really love,

08:59.798 --> 09:01.198
like, totally freaked me out.

09:01.232 --> 09:03.200
Eight years ago,
I accepted a random internship

09:03.234 --> 09:04.368
at the Parks Department,

09:04.402 --> 09:06.203
and then Leslie told me
to do a bunch of stuff,

09:06.237 --> 09:08.772
and now I'm executive director
of regional whatever--

09:08.807 --> 09:10.140
I don't even know what it means,

09:10.175 --> 09:12.576
and I never even asked myself
if I even really like it.

09:12.610 --> 09:14.511
I mean, it's like
what is my purpose in life?

09:14.546 --> 09:17.214
What do I even care about?

09:17.248 --> 09:18.549
My insides are dying.

09:18.583 --> 09:21.051
So, not fine.

09:21.085 --> 09:22.753
I don't know what to do.
I have to quit.

09:22.787 --> 09:23.954
To do what?

09:23.988 --> 09:25.556
I'm just gonna go
live under a bridge

09:25.590 --> 09:26.990
and ask people riddles
before they cross.

09:27.025 --> 09:28.125
Okay, hold on.

09:28.159 --> 09:29.960
Do you remember what Joan said
at the ceremony?

09:29.994 --> 09:31.562
That is doesn't count
as stripping

09:31.596 --> 09:32.830
if no one pays you?

09:32.864 --> 09:34.798
Yes, she did say that, but no.

09:34.833 --> 09:37.534
She knew she wanted to be on TV
when she was ten.

09:37.569 --> 09:40.604
So what did you want to be
when you were ten?

09:42.707 --> 09:45.309
It says here
the future of caskets

09:45.343 --> 09:47.845
may just be
biodegradable plastic.

09:47.879 --> 09:49.847
Oh, you don't say.
Hey, are you chilly?

09:49.881 --> 09:50.948
I'm a little chilly, I think.

09:50.982 --> 09:52.649
- No.
- Hey, guys.

09:52.684 --> 09:54.451
Welcome.
I'm Dan.

09:54.486 --> 09:56.253
Hi, I'm Ben.
This is April.

09:56.287 --> 09:58.288
And I'm scared of death.

09:58.323 --> 10:01.191
I'm just really interested
in learning what you do.

10:01.226 --> 10:02.292
You're gonna love it here.

10:02.327 --> 10:05.329
People are dying to get in.
[Chuckles]

10:05.363 --> 10:06.497
Come on, come on.

10:06.531 --> 10:09.466
We'll start
down at the cadaver chute.

10:09.501 --> 10:12.236
The cadaver chute.
Come on!

10:12.270 --> 10:13.971
So this is where
you want to eat lunch?

10:14.005 --> 10:15.205
In a steakhouse?

10:15.240 --> 10:17.074
Don't you have
irritable bowel syndrome?

10:17.108 --> 10:18.408
God, I hate that I know that.

10:18.443 --> 10:20.244
Yeah, it's murder
on the old plumbing,

10:20.278 --> 10:23.814
but, uh, Tammy only wants me
to eat steak and whiskey.

10:23.848 --> 10:26.784
She has my stool analyzed
just to keep me honest.

10:26.818 --> 10:28.919
I don't think this
relationship is that healthy.

10:28.953 --> 10:32.089
I mean, it seems like Tammy
is trying to turn you into Ron,

10:32.123 --> 10:34.558
and you're Jeremy Jamm,
I mean, come on.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.960
You love Porsches
and spiked iced tea,

10:36.995 --> 10:38.762
and you have
a Hooters platinum card.

10:38.797 --> 10:41.098
Yeah, Tammy doesn't really
let me do that stuff anymore.

10:41.132 --> 10:43.400
But, uh, you know, it's good,
you know?

10:43.435 --> 10:44.535
I'm better now.

10:44.569 --> 10:46.003
I mean, sure, I'm depressed,

10:46.037 --> 10:48.305
and, uh, I'm constantly sick,

10:48.339 --> 10:50.040
and nothing
really brings me joy,

10:50.075 --> 10:52.209
but it just feels right.

10:52.243 --> 10:55.512
[Sobbing]
Oh, God.

10:55.547 --> 10:57.881
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, help me, Knope.

10:57.916 --> 10:59.550
Oh, I used to be so great.

10:59.584 --> 11:01.251
Remember?
Everybody thought so.

11:01.286 --> 11:02.853
- Well--
- [Sobbing]

11:02.887 --> 11:04.288
- Oh, God.
- Wow.

11:04.322 --> 11:06.557
- This is worse than I thought.
- [Exhales]

11:06.591 --> 11:09.393
You're broken.
She has broken you.

11:09.427 --> 11:11.228
You need to get away from her.

11:11.262 --> 11:12.542
Oh, God. Whoa, hey.
Look at that.

11:12.564 --> 11:17.301
More hair came out.
[Laughing]

11:17.335 --> 11:18.969
[Sobbing]

11:20.338 --> 11:22.378
Yeah, I think you're really
going to like it here.

11:22.407 --> 11:24.341
And obviously everyone's
in a really great mood now

11:24.376 --> 11:25.909
because of the Cubs
winning the series.

11:25.944 --> 11:27.211
Yeah, it seems really nice.

11:27.245 --> 11:29.179
I mean, I am gonna miss
Pawnee, though.

11:29.214 --> 11:31.181
My wife's there,
for crying out loud.

11:31.216 --> 11:32.337
Yeah, tell me about Pawnee.

11:32.350 --> 11:33.711
It sounds like
it's really changed.

11:33.718 --> 11:35.438
Oh, yeah.
There's a ton of new businesses.

11:35.453 --> 11:36.687
Gryzzl came in.

11:36.721 --> 11:39.757
They gave everyone free tablets
and wi-fi and phones.

11:39.791 --> 11:42.226
You can watch <i> Hitch 2</i>
anytime, anywhere.

11:42.260 --> 11:43.894
Finally, that's the dream.

11:43.928 --> 11:45.996
Part of me wants
to go back, you know?

11:46.030 --> 11:47.831
I always kind of liked it there.

11:47.866 --> 11:50.434
Man, you got me
really missing Pawnee now.

11:50.468 --> 11:53.137
I don't know what to do.
Am I making the right decision?

11:53.171 --> 11:55.205
[Groans]

11:55.240 --> 11:57.141
Hey.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.510
- Why are you here?
- I'm calling a temporary truce.

11:59.544 --> 12:01.412
You need to help me
break up Jamm and Tammy.

12:01.446 --> 12:02.813
Forget it.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.848
You just want Jamm
to switch his vote.

12:04.883 --> 12:07.017
What is this,
revenge for Morningstar?

12:07.052 --> 12:08.519
No, it is not about that.

12:08.553 --> 12:09.820
It is not about the vote.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.488
There is a guy in real trouble,

12:11.523 --> 12:12.856
and you might be
the only one who can help him.

12:12.891 --> 12:14.558
This is
about saving someone's soul.

12:14.592 --> 12:17.561
He is a monster.
Monsters do not have souls.

12:17.595 --> 12:19.630
Uh, have you ever seen
<i>Monsters, Inc.?</i>

12:19.664 --> 12:21.265
- No.
- Damn it, Ron.

12:21.299 --> 12:23.033
Engage in the culture
once in a while.

12:23.068 --> 12:24.935
Jamm, get in here.

12:28.807 --> 12:31.342
Good God, man.
What happened to you?

12:31.376 --> 12:32.810
Tammy happened to him!

12:32.844 --> 12:34.845
Remind you of anyone, Ron?

12:34.879 --> 12:36.580
We need to put our issues aside

12:36.614 --> 12:39.917
and defend
this miserable person.

12:39.951 --> 12:42.319
Jeremy, this is a gold bar.

12:42.353 --> 12:43.487
You keep that in your desk?

12:43.521 --> 12:45.356
I will give you this gold bar

12:45.390 --> 12:48.659
if you say one
unflattering thing about Tammy.

12:48.693 --> 12:51.462
If I do...

12:51.496 --> 12:53.263
does Tammy get to keep the gold?

12:53.298 --> 12:54.465
Oh, my God.

12:54.499 --> 12:55.933
When it comes to Tammy,

12:55.967 --> 12:58.302
the code is the same as that
of the battlefield:

12:58.336 --> 13:00.370
First, you leave no man behind.

13:00.405 --> 13:02.105
Second, you must
protect yourself

13:02.140 --> 13:04.775
against chemical warfare.

13:04.809 --> 13:08.145
Tammy does not abide
by the Geneva convention.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.891
I made
this Tammy de-programming kit

13:11.925 --> 13:14.466
in case I ever fell victim
to her again.

13:14.586 --> 13:17.688
First, this is a chastity belt
that I made by hand.

13:17.722 --> 13:19.690
It might be a couple sizes
too big for you,

13:19.724 --> 13:21.625
but you can just pad it.

13:21.660 --> 13:24.328
The first step
is to cut out all sex.

13:24.362 --> 13:25.629
That won't be necessary.

13:25.664 --> 13:26.897
We haven't done the deed yet.

13:26.932 --> 13:29.700
She lets me rub up
against her leg sometimes.

13:29.734 --> 13:31.268
Well, all the more reason
to wear it.

13:31.303 --> 13:33.537
She knows she has that card
left to play,

13:33.572 --> 13:35.372
and you best believe she will.

13:35.407 --> 13:37.441
We're also gonna try
a Pavlovian technique.

13:37.476 --> 13:41.045
Ron is holding
Tammy's perfume, Girth.

13:41.079 --> 13:42.179
Oh.

13:42.214 --> 13:44.915
Oh, smells good.
Oh!

13:44.950 --> 13:46.350
Again.

13:46.385 --> 13:47.751
Tammy.
Oh!

13:47.786 --> 13:49.220
How many times
are we gonna do this?

13:49.254 --> 13:50.888
Until the bottle is empty.
Again.

13:50.922 --> 13:52.089
Twice.

13:52.123 --> 13:53.290
Tam--
Ahh!

13:53.325 --> 13:54.291
Ahh!

13:54.326 --> 13:56.227
It's going well so far,

13:56.261 --> 14:00.831
but it's too early to tell.

14:00.866 --> 14:02.666
- Oh.
- He was pretty far gone.

14:02.701 --> 14:04.535
[Whimpers]

14:04.569 --> 14:06.504
Hopefully we get
a body in today,

14:06.538 --> 14:09.373
so I can show you guys
the really fun part:

14:09.407 --> 14:10.474
Draining.

14:10.509 --> 14:11.842
Oh, God.
I hate this so much.

14:11.877 --> 14:13.410
Cool.
Can I touch a dead body?

14:13.445 --> 14:15.179
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, eager beaver.

14:15.213 --> 14:17.281
That doesn't happen
for at least a year.

14:17.315 --> 14:18.983
Why?
How did you become a mortician?

14:19.017 --> 14:20.217
Can't I just sign up?

14:20.252 --> 14:21.352
Oh, gosh, no.

14:21.386 --> 14:22.753
You need two years of school

14:22.788 --> 14:24.054
and a year-long apprenticeship.

14:24.089 --> 14:27.625
First few years
are mostly paperwork and filing.

14:27.659 --> 14:30.194
Ugh! Why is every job
just paperwork?

14:30.228 --> 14:32.463
Hey, it's a living.
[Chuckles]

14:32.497 --> 14:34.298
Yeah, I think
we're just gonna go, Dan.

14:34.332 --> 14:37.368
Um, the reality of your life
is incredibly depressing.

14:37.402 --> 14:38.903
I'm just gonna stay
at my current job

14:38.937 --> 14:41.505
until I get old and die
and then end up here

14:41.540 --> 14:42.873
being embalmed by some weirdo

14:42.908 --> 14:44.508
who had to go to school
for three years

14:44.543 --> 14:46.210
just to cut my guts open.

14:46.244 --> 14:48.245
- Let's go.
- Oh, thank God.

14:48.280 --> 14:50.681
Okay.
Have a good one.

14:50.716 --> 14:52.249
Okay, we're gonna do some scenes

14:52.284 --> 14:54.718
and demonstrate ways
that you can resist Tammy.

14:54.753 --> 14:57.154
I will play Tammy.
Ron will play you.

14:57.189 --> 14:59.190
[Imitating Tammy]
Hey there, horsey.

14:59.224 --> 15:02.193
Time to mount up
and ride on into Bonertown.

15:02.227 --> 15:05.763
What do you say we get stanky
in that pet store bathroom?

15:05.797 --> 15:08.332
- Huh, Jamm? Hmm? Huh? Huh?
- Do it.

15:08.366 --> 15:10.201
There will be
no sex today, Tammy.

15:10.235 --> 15:11.469
Oh.

15:11.503 --> 15:13.370
Instead, why don't you go
into the pet store

15:13.405 --> 15:15.272
and feed yourself to the snakes?

15:15.307 --> 15:18.209
To hell with you, woman.
Good-bye.

15:18.243 --> 15:19.777
Hey, you big hunk
of wiener meat.

15:19.811 --> 15:23.013
I've got 40 handtowels,
some energy bars,

15:23.048 --> 15:24.849
and a Chinese finger trap.

15:24.883 --> 15:26.550
Let's get gross.

15:26.585 --> 15:28.252
This gambit has failed.

15:28.286 --> 15:30.588
To hell with you, woman.
Good-bye.

15:30.622 --> 15:31.722
What are you wearing?

15:31.756 --> 15:33.691
It's a crotch-blinder
of my own design.

15:33.725 --> 15:37.261
In this scenario, she will be
coming at you pants-less.

15:37.295 --> 15:38.696
Okay.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.898
Doors are locked.
Window is secured.

15:40.932 --> 15:43.234
There is no way
Tammy's getting in here.

15:43.268 --> 15:44.568
Jamm.

15:44.603 --> 15:47.171
Strip down, you sex maggot.

15:47.205 --> 15:48.906
And hold!

15:48.940 --> 15:50.074
What was your mistake?

15:50.108 --> 15:52.676
You didn't check the armoire.

15:52.711 --> 15:54.645
Tammy once camped out
in my attic

15:54.679 --> 15:57.148
for six days
awaiting my arrival.

15:57.182 --> 15:59.550
She survived on rats
and rainwater.

15:59.584 --> 16:01.919
Let's run it again!

16:01.953 --> 16:03.953
I gotta say, hanging out
with Lucy's been so fun.

16:03.955 --> 16:05.122
She's the best.

16:05.157 --> 16:07.057
And I love
that she's buying us stuff.

16:07.092 --> 16:08.826
Dude, make your move.
Ask her out.

16:08.860 --> 16:10.194
I don't know.
She lives here.

16:10.228 --> 16:12.997
- How would it even work?
- Life is about taking risks.

16:13.031 --> 16:15.432
Look at me, Tom.
I'm moving to Chicago.

16:15.467 --> 16:16.967
It's just us right now.

16:17.002 --> 16:18.269
Do you really think
you're moving here?

16:18.303 --> 16:20.171
One double XL, one kid's XL.

16:20.205 --> 16:22.073
- Hey, you remembered my size.
- Yeah.

16:22.107 --> 16:23.707
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:23.742 --> 16:25.276
Hey, Lucy,
can I ask you something?

16:25.310 --> 16:26.277
Of course.
What's up?

16:26.311 --> 16:27.244
I was wondering,

16:27.279 --> 16:31.115
would you want to maybe...

16:31.149 --> 16:32.616
come work for me in Pawnee?

16:32.651 --> 16:35.886
I have the company,
and it's growing so fast.

16:35.921 --> 16:37.888
I can't do it all myself,
and I need a manager,

16:37.923 --> 16:39.423
and you're a perfect candidate.

16:39.457 --> 16:41.625
Wow.
Really?

16:41.660 --> 16:44.428
That does sound kind of awesome.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.430
And it'd be super fun
to work with you.

16:46.465 --> 16:48.999
I mean, I have to talk to my
boyfriend about it first, but...

16:49.034 --> 16:50.935
Yeah, of course!

16:50.969 --> 16:52.269
This is all perfect,

16:52.304 --> 16:54.205
and everything's worked out
just as I'd hoped.

16:54.239 --> 16:55.606
[Chuckles]

16:55.640 --> 16:58.476
Hey, this is why
they call it Beantown, huh?

17:00.378 --> 17:01.445
Hey, Jere-bear.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.714
What are you doing
with these two jabronis?

17:03.748 --> 17:06.650
Tammy, I've given this
a lot of thought.

17:06.685 --> 17:08.385
We should break up.

17:08.420 --> 17:11.255
[Laughs]

17:11.289 --> 17:12.489
What's the matter, little boy?

17:12.491 --> 17:14.592
Did the bad people get to you?

17:14.626 --> 17:17.595
They just made me realize how
unhealthy this is, literally.

17:17.628 --> 17:19.964
All the steak and whiskey--
I have to wear a diaper.

17:19.998 --> 17:22.266
That's 'cause
you're my widdle baby.

17:22.300 --> 17:23.501
We drilled you on this, Jamm.

17:23.535 --> 17:24.768
Baby talk, what do you do?

17:24.803 --> 17:27.538
I'm not a baby.
I'm a big boy!

17:27.571 --> 17:29.807
Yeah, okay. That--
well, that wasn't terrible.

17:29.841 --> 17:32.643
Don't listen to Leslie.
She's trying to manipulate you.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.979
All she cares about is herself,
and I can prove it.

17:35.013 --> 17:37.047
How's this, Leslie?

17:37.082 --> 17:40.351
You leave us alone,
and we swing the vote to you?

17:40.385 --> 17:44.121
Help you get your park.

17:44.156 --> 17:45.856
No. Nice try.

17:45.891 --> 17:47.725
Stay strong, Jeremy.

17:47.759 --> 17:49.460
- It's over, Tammy.
- Tell you what.

17:49.494 --> 17:51.495
It's been long enough.

17:51.530 --> 17:55.599
What do you say we
consummate our relationship...

17:55.634 --> 17:57.234
- tonight?
- [Breathing heavily]

17:57.269 --> 17:59.970
Huh?
Let's do it.

18:00.005 --> 18:04.041
[Chuckles]
And the last card is played.

18:04.075 --> 18:06.811
- What are you doing?
- Shh! This is a library.

18:06.845 --> 18:08.045
Do you see
what's happening here?

18:08.080 --> 18:09.947
Ron, I need
that crotch-blinder.

18:09.981 --> 18:12.950
No, you don't.
Just end it.

18:12.984 --> 18:13.951
[Exhales deeply]

18:13.985 --> 18:15.085
- Look at my boobs.
- No.

18:15.120 --> 18:16.287
- Look downstairs.
- No.

18:16.321 --> 18:17.521
There's a prize inside for you.

18:17.522 --> 18:18.489
It's over, Tammy.

18:18.523 --> 18:19.557
What?

18:19.591 --> 18:22.693
To hell with you, woman.
Good-bye.

18:22.727 --> 18:26.230
How dare you?
Are you kidding me?

18:26.264 --> 18:28.466
You'll be back!
They all come back!

18:28.500 --> 18:30.568
- Well done, Jeremy.
- [Screaming]

18:30.602 --> 18:33.737
Turns out the crotch-blinder
was inside you all along.

18:33.772 --> 18:36.187
Everybody,
who wants to get it on?

18:36.307 --> 18:37.384
I'm naked!

18:39.001 --> 18:40.835
Donna, what do I do?

18:40.869 --> 18:43.137
If working around corpses
isn't even right for me,

18:43.172 --> 18:44.872
then nothing is.

18:44.907 --> 18:47.441
I feel totally lost.

18:47.476 --> 18:49.744
- Saturn's return.
- What?

18:49.778 --> 18:53.080
Saturn's orbit around the sun
takes roughly 29 years,

18:53.115 --> 18:55.149
and when it gets back to where
it was when you were born,

18:55.184 --> 18:57.552
lots of turmoil,
self-discovery.

18:57.586 --> 18:58.686
When I was your age,

18:58.720 --> 19:00.855
I got banned
from every riverboat in Germany.

19:00.889 --> 19:03.124
Donna, April,
what are you up to?

19:03.158 --> 19:05.660
Oh, you know,
just regionally directing

19:05.694 --> 19:07.461
the Midwest whatever
of who cares.

19:07.496 --> 19:08.563
Oh, isn't it great?

19:08.597 --> 19:10.832
Can you believe
that they pay me for this?

19:10.866 --> 19:13.034
Because I would do this
for free.

19:13.068 --> 19:15.002
Aw, jeez!

19:15.037 --> 19:18.506
[Chuckles]
I do miss you, Terry.

19:18.540 --> 19:20.041
Let me get you some napkins.

19:20.075 --> 19:23.544
April, you looked
at one horrifying job.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.012
I've got a few more ideas.

19:25.047 --> 19:26.881
We'll find you
something you like, okay?

19:26.915 --> 19:28.449
Okay.

19:28.484 --> 19:30.151
But you can't tell Leslie
I might leave.

19:30.185 --> 19:31.986
She'll have a heart attack.
Promise?

19:32.020 --> 19:33.187
I promise.

19:33.222 --> 19:34.789
Why are you
so into helping me right now?

19:34.823 --> 19:37.358
Because I'm finally doing
what I love,

19:37.392 --> 19:39.660
and I know how hard it is
to get to that place.

19:39.695 --> 19:44.332
And I want you to be happy
because you're my friend.

19:44.366 --> 19:47.835
No, I'm not.
I've never cared for you.

19:50.572 --> 19:54.175
Wait, wait.

19:54.209 --> 19:58.045
You're behaving very strangely.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.981
Saturn's return.

20:00.015 --> 20:01.582
Hey, Brokemons.

20:01.617 --> 20:02.817
I just wanted to let you know

20:02.851 --> 20:05.419
that I will be abstaining
from the vote today.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.588
You are
my two all-time best friends,

20:07.623 --> 20:08.890
and you brought me back
from the brink,

20:08.924 --> 20:11.058
so I can't choose sides.

20:11.093 --> 20:13.694
Although if I had to pick
one side, it would be

20:13.729 --> 20:15.830
Lucy Liu's backside.

20:15.864 --> 20:18.933
[Laughs]

20:18.967 --> 20:21.569
Without Jamm,
the vote's two-two.

20:21.603 --> 20:23.538
This was all for nothing.

20:23.572 --> 20:25.006
I thought it was very big of you

20:25.040 --> 20:28.102
to not bend when Tammy
promised you the vote.

20:28.626 --> 20:30.907
Well, I thought it was very big
of you to help him at all.

20:31.557 --> 20:32.942
You didn't have to do that.

20:35.530 --> 20:37.570
Okay, back to work to figure out
how to destroy you.

20:37.619 --> 20:38.684
Same. Good bye.

20:40.599 --> 20:43.144
Dude, thank you so much for this.
I really owe you one.

20:43.264 --> 20:44.029
No, you don't.

20:44.270 --> 20:46.750
You're smart and qualified
and we're totally lucky to have you.

20:46.826 --> 20:48.058
Okay, let's do this.

20:48.444 --> 20:51.899
Still don't know what claiming
allowances means. I always put 6.

20:52.019 --> 20:55.097
- So far so good.
- Dude, you are totally going to jail.

20:56.201 --> 20:57.947
This couldn't have worked out any better.

20:58.333 --> 21:01.054
There was a guy eating lunch in here
who didn't finish his spaghetti.

21:01.670 --> 21:03.951
Oh, also, Tom and Lucy
are totally going to fall in love!

21:05.159 --> 21:06.641
Five second rule!

21:06.761 --> 21:12.183
