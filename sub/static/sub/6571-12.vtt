00:02.001 --> 00:05.403
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

00:05.505 --> 00:07.496
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:09.598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:15.148 --> 00:16.843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

00:19.052 --> 00:21.384
- George Michael?
<i>[Man Narrating] Michael was looking for his son...</i>

00:21.488 --> 00:23.581
<i>with whom he had a secret to share.</i>

00:23.690 --> 00:26.591
- There you are. Hey, pal. You alone?
- Almost always, yeah.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.025
<i>You know,</i>
<i>Maeby's never around anymore...</i>

00:29.129 --> 00:31.791
and Ann's off with her religious group,
trying to get <i>Nip/Tuck</i> off the air.

00:31.898 --> 00:34.458
- They don't like <i>Nip/Tuck?</i>
- Well, you know, they don't like anything.

00:34.567 --> 00:37.035
Something about God wants people
to age naturally- I don't know.

00:37.137 --> 00:39.037
Ironically, she likes Gangy.

00:39.139 --> 00:43.701
Listen, you know, I would never date anyone
without you being okay with it, right?

00:43.810 --> 00:47.906
- You don't have to do that.
- Great, because I didn't do it this time.

00:48.014 --> 00:53.042
<i>L- I kind of reconnected with that blind</i>
<i>prosecutor I used to date, Maggie Lizer.</i>

00:53.153 --> 00:54.882
Her?

00:54.988 --> 00:58.253
- Didn't she turn out to not be blind though?
- <i>Exactly.</i>

00:58.358 --> 01:01.259
But she's filled out a little bit.

01:01.361 --> 01:03.989
<i>[Narrator] Michael hadn't seen her</i>
<i>in eight and a half months...</i>

01:04.096 --> 01:06.065
<i>during which she</i> had <i>filled out.</i>

01:06.166 --> 01:08.396
Really?
Could have sworn it was a year.

01:08.501 --> 01:13.131
And it seems as if I'm the father.

01:13.239 --> 01:15.833
Do you know this for sure?
I mean, she does lie.

01:15.942 --> 01:18.467
- She might not really be pregnant.
- See, that's what I thought.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.478
- Boy, you really are my kid.
- Good.

01:20.580 --> 01:23.174
Apparently, so is this one.

01:23.283 --> 01:25.751
<i>[Narrator] Michael found this out</i>
<i>after having Lindsay and Tobias...</i>

01:25.852 --> 01:29.185
<i>break into Maggie's house</i>
<i>and hide in the bathroom...</i>

01:29.289 --> 01:31.257
<i>to collect and test her urine.</i>

01:31.357 --> 01:35.691
- <i>It was there that they stumbled upon a fat suit.</i>
- That's what it is.

01:35.795 --> 01:37.820
<i>Michael confronted Maggie about this.</i>

01:37.931 --> 01:41.662
Oh, you're so right, Michael,
'cause I'm fakin' it-

01:41.768 --> 01:45.204
- <i>But he was proven wrong.</i>
- Not.

01:45.305 --> 01:48.468
<i>Maybe it'll be exciting, you know?</i>
<i>Be a big brother. It'll be fun.</i>

01:48.575 --> 01:51.601
- There you go. It would be fun, wouldn't it?
- Big brother. Me.

01:51.711 --> 01:54.111
Not gonna happen though.
She doesn't want anything to do with me.

01:54.214 --> 01:57.877
But I know you've been bored.
You and I are gonna have some fun together.

01:57.984 --> 02:00.612
Maybe we'll even have ourselves
a little adventure.

02:00.720 --> 02:03.746
- Yeah.
- Meanwhile, I guess
this family's big enough, huh?

02:03.857 --> 02:07.054
<i>[Narrator] In fact, Michael's family</i>
<i>hadjust gotten a little smaller.</i>

02:07.160 --> 02:09.252
- Hello?
- [Screaming]

02:09.362 --> 02:12.058
Mom, you've got to stop
starting conversations like that.

02:12.165 --> 02:15.794
Something happened to Buster.
He lost part of his body.

02:15.902 --> 02:18.803
- I don't know which one.
- [Oscar] The hand.

02:18.905 --> 02:21.339
I told him to stay out of the ocean,
but we had a fight.

02:21.441 --> 02:23.568
- Who remembers about what?
- <i>[Narrator] I do.</i>

02:23.676 --> 02:27.510
<i>Buster had discovered that</i>
<i>his Uncle Oscar was his true father.</i>

02:27.614 --> 02:30.139
- You lied to me.
- You were never supposed to know.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.741
I'm going to war!

02:32.852 --> 02:37.152
<i>[Narrator] As an act of defiance to Lucille,</i>
<i>he first went swimming in the ocean...</i>

02:37.257 --> 02:40.021
- <i>where he was attacked by a loose seal.</i>
- <i>[Seal Barking]</i>

02:40.126 --> 02:42.151
If only your father was here.

02:42.262 --> 02:46.392
- Oh, that George. God only knows where he is.
- The car!

02:46.499 --> 02:50.663
- Up yours, granny!
- You couldn't handle it!

02:50.770 --> 02:53.568
<i>[Narrator] In fact, George Sr.</i>
<i>Had snuck out of the attic...</i>

02:53.673 --> 02:55.971
<i>and gone to a local Ford dealership.</i>

02:56.075 --> 02:58.043
Yeah, the Bronco's been discontinued.

02:58.144 --> 03:00.578
We're trying to shed that whole
"fugitive on the run" thing.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.581
- This is the Escape.
- What a fun name, hmm?

03:03.683 --> 03:05.878
- Mm-hmm.
- May I test-drive?

03:05.985 --> 03:08.180
- [Tires Screeching]
- [Horn Honks]

03:08.288 --> 03:11.519
- Up yours, granny!
<i>- [Lucille] You couldn't handle it!</i>

03:11.624 --> 03:15.025
<i>[Narrator] Soon, Michael and</i>
<i>George Michael arrived at the hospital.</i>

03:15.128 --> 03:18.461
- If something happens to Buster, I'll be lost.
- Yeah. Excuse me.

03:18.565 --> 03:21.932
George Michael, you're going to
have to be the baby of the family.

03:22.035 --> 03:25.903
- Um, Maeby's younger than me.
<i>- You're never going in the ocean! Never!</i>

03:26.005 --> 03:28.633
- We're here to see him.
- You're my baby! I'm never letting you go!

03:28.741 --> 03:31.733
- Please stay away from my son.
- You're my baby now! No, he's my baby!

03:31.844 --> 03:34.108
The hell with all of you.
I have a man.

03:34.214 --> 03:38.048
- [Gasps]
- [Doctor] Excuse me.

03:38.151 --> 03:40.381
- <i>Are you the Bluths?</i>
- <i>[Lucille] Not Dr. Wordsmith.</i>

03:40.486 --> 03:43.080
- How's my son?
- He's going to be all right.

03:43.189 --> 03:45.384
- Thank God.
- <i>[Lindsay] Finally some good news from this guy.</i>

03:45.491 --> 03:47.959
- No other way to take that.
- That's a great attitude.

03:48.061 --> 03:51.758
I gotta tell you. If I was given this news,
I don't know that I'd take it this well.

03:51.864 --> 03:53.491
But you said he was all right.

03:53.600 --> 03:57.127
Yes. He's lost his left hand,
so he's going to be "all right."

03:57.237 --> 03:59.671
You son of a bitch!
I hate this doctor!

03:59.772 --> 04:04.505
- He's a very literal man.
- Yes, that's more the way I would take the news.

04:04.611 --> 04:06.511
<i>[Buster]</i>
<i>Actually, I'm relieved.</i>

04:06.613 --> 04:09.741
I don't have to go to army because
the seal with the bow tie attacked me.

04:09.849 --> 04:13.114
- I feel like I've lost three pounds.
- Seal with the bow tie?

04:13.219 --> 04:15.278
Yeah.
I think that's what I saw bite me.

04:15.388 --> 04:19.119
I just wish I could remember why I went
in the ocean. Did we fight or something?

04:19.225 --> 04:21.125
Of course not.

04:21.226 --> 04:24.492
Although I always have warned you
against the ocean. So has your father.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.259
My father.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.494
George Sr. You need more juice.

04:29.602 --> 04:33.595
Where's the juice?
Give my son the juice!

04:33.706 --> 04:35.936
Buster, it's okay.
Doctor says you're gonna be fine.

04:36.042 --> 04:38.533
And if they can find the hand,
they're gonna be able to reattach it.

04:38.645 --> 04:40.545
- You know, like a transplant.
- <i>I'm fine.</i>

04:40.647 --> 04:46.279
This is a blessing. And speaking of blessings,
I heard there's gonna be a baby.

04:46.386 --> 04:50.288
- [Giggling]
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
But please, don't worry about that.

04:50.390 --> 04:52.950
What's more important is that you're
really doin' well with this, pal.

04:53.059 --> 04:54.788
My hat is off to you.

04:54.894 --> 04:57.795
And my hand is off to you.

04:57.897 --> 05:01.128
- <i>[Hysterical Laughing]</i>
- [Forced Laughing]

05:01.234 --> 05:04.294
No, no, I meant, don't get
your hopes up about that-

05:04.404 --> 05:07.862
- Hand transplant.
- [Forced Laugh]

05:07.974 --> 05:11.501
No, the, uh, baby.
The mother doesn't want me around.

05:11.611 --> 05:14.341
We kind of had a little bit of a fight.

05:14.447 --> 05:17.644
- You obviously care about
this Maggie woman, don't you?
- Yes, I do. Of course I do.

05:17.750 --> 05:20.514
I mean, a seal didn't bite
your Linus off, did it?

05:20.620 --> 05:23.248
- No, a seal didn't bite my Linus off.
- Good.

05:23.356 --> 05:25.347
- <i>Then go to her. Ask for her hand.</i>
- Yeah.

05:25.458 --> 05:28.427
And, uh, maybe...

05:28.528 --> 05:31.224
I'll get one for my brother
while I'm at it.

05:31.331 --> 05:35.199
- Yeah. Get him out of here.
- [Laughing]

05:35.301 --> 05:37.428
- Hmm?
- Get him out of here!

05:37.537 --> 05:39.334
Get the- [Bleeps]
Out of my room!

05:39.439 --> 05:41.737
- Oh, my God! Buster!
- Oh, my God!

05:41.841 --> 05:44.935
- Buster, what's wrong? Nurse!
- [Screaming]

05:45.044 --> 05:47.012
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>So, at his brother's suggestion...</i>

05:47.113 --> 05:49.843
<i>Michael went to the courthouse</i>
<i>determined to win Maggie back.</i>

05:49.949 --> 05:53.009
- Have you seen Maggie? It's kind of important.
- Oh, you just missed her.

05:53.119 --> 05:56.020
She's in the bar.
What a spanking I gave her in court today.

05:57.123 --> 05:59.591
- Go get 'em.
- He spanked me!

05:59.692 --> 06:01.660
- Did you spank her?
- No!

06:01.761 --> 06:05.356
<i>You know, that waitress she's representing</i>
<i>is suing my client for making her fat.</i>

06:05.465 --> 06:09.026
But here's the thing.
Loretta is not fat.

06:09.135 --> 06:13.094
Maggie bought her a fat suit,
and I've got the receipt to prove it.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.572
Of course.
That's what the fat suit is for.

06:15.675 --> 06:18.576
Well, I've gotta find her. I owe her an apology.
You said she's at a bar?

06:18.678 --> 06:21.772
Friday night. You might want
to try Miss Temple's. Tell her Barry said-

06:21.881 --> 06:24.315
- [Spanks]
- Ooh, I did good today.

06:24.417 --> 06:26.544
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And Michael caught up with Maggie.</i>

06:26.652 --> 06:28.586
You know,
there have been lies, yes.

06:28.688 --> 06:32.283
But it's not like either one of us would ever
do anything to hurt the other person.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.292
Hello, Officers.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.557
Well, there's no further sign
of a break-in at your house.

06:37.663 --> 06:41.724
<i>And since you haven't called us back, we again</i>
<i>left the number, in case there's a problem.</i>

06:41.834 --> 06:44.598
- Thanks, Officer Taylor.
- <i>Just next time, uh, call us back.</i>

06:44.704 --> 06:46.729
Hey, the break-in?
I told you that was us.

06:46.839 --> 06:50.605
Well, maybe I did want to hurt you,
because I was hurt.

06:50.710 --> 06:56.649
- The only reason you're here
is out of loyalty to the baby.
- It's not just about the baby.

06:56.749 --> 06:59.616
Maggie, there was a reason that you and I
got together in the first place...

06:59.719 --> 07:01.687
when we made this baby, okay?

07:01.788 --> 07:06.418
There's something here, as long
as we never lie to each other again.

07:06.526 --> 07:09.859
Well, then I have to come clean
about one more thing.

07:09.962 --> 07:11.930
- Oh, no.
- You're not the father.

07:12.031 --> 07:13.498
Come on.

07:13.599 --> 07:17.296
I went to a sperm bank, okay,
the week before we even met.

07:17.403 --> 07:21.100
The father's some guy from Harvard,
but that's all I know.

07:21.207 --> 07:24.301
That's great. He's probably
some geek <i>Simpsons</i> writer's kid.

07:24.410 --> 07:26.776
I never thought
I'd meet someone like you.

07:26.879 --> 07:28.608
- Mmm.
- But come on.

07:28.714 --> 07:31.615
I mean, do you still really want me?

07:31.717 --> 07:33.514
Are you really that great of a guy?

07:33.619 --> 07:37.419
<i>[Narrator] Michael had always thought</i>
<i>ofhimself as that great a guy.</i>

07:37.523 --> 07:41.789
- <i>The kind of guy who could</i>
<i>raise someone else's baby.</i>
- Of course I am.

07:41.894 --> 07:43.862
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>But he wasn't...</i>

07:43.963 --> 07:46.796
- <i>and he regretted it the moment he said it.</i>
- [Mouthing Words]

07:50.436 --> 07:54.202
<i>[Narrator] The next day, the family gathered</i>
<i>to welcome Buster home from the hospital.</i>

07:54.307 --> 07:56.502
<i>He's coming.</i>
<i>What he's wearing is temporary.</i>

07:56.609 --> 08:01.546
Please don't comment on it or salute him
like that idiot guard down there did to him.

08:01.647 --> 08:04.912
Well, look who's back.

08:05.017 --> 08:07.212
- <i>Let's all say hello.</i>
- <i>Hi.</i>

08:07.320 --> 08:10.517
And while you're at it,
let's all give me a big hand!

08:10.623 --> 08:15.526
[Forced Laughing]

08:15.628 --> 08:18.688
George Michael, get your uncle
a bandage for his forehead.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.766
And while you're at it, uh, get two.

08:20.867 --> 08:22.266
Oh, my God.

08:22.368 --> 08:25.166
Guess this means you don't wanna
play "got your nose" with me.

08:25.271 --> 08:27.603
[Forced Laughing]

08:27.707 --> 08:29.937
Oh, what's the matter, Buster?

08:30.042 --> 08:31.942
- Did you hurt yourself?
- Uh, hi, Gob.

08:32.044 --> 08:34.511
Oh, my God! What-What happened to your-
He's got no hand!

08:34.614 --> 08:36.582
Buster went swimming in the ocean...

08:36.682 --> 08:39.378
and, according to him,
a seal with a bow tie bit off his hand.

08:39.485 --> 08:40.850
Bow tie?

08:40.953 --> 08:44.081
It's merely the playful mutterings
of the shock victim.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.249
A seal would never prey on a human...

08:46.359 --> 08:49.123
unless, of course, it had acquired
a taste for mammal blood.

08:49.228 --> 08:51.526
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Gob had recently dressed a seal in a bow tie...</i>

08:51.631 --> 08:54.099
<i>and used him in a magic trick.</i>

08:54.200 --> 08:56.725
- <i>When it failed,</i>
<i>he released the seal into the ocean.</i>
- <i>[Cat Screeches]</i>

08:56.836 --> 09:00.795
You're back in the real world.
You're not gonna be hand-fed anymore.

09:00.907 --> 09:03.637
How the hell would a seal know
how to tie a bow tie anyway?

09:03.743 --> 09:08.112
- I can barely tie
the yellow one that I wear in my act.
- This one had a yellow bow tie!

09:08.214 --> 09:09.806
Really?

09:09.916 --> 09:12.714
<i>[Narrator] And later, Lucille</i>
<i>could not contain her guilt any longer.</i>

09:12.818 --> 09:16.652
I did this. I prayed that God
take anything he wanted from us...

09:16.756 --> 09:18.656
so that Buster wouldn't
have to go to war.

09:18.758 --> 09:22.387
Oh, Mom. After all these years,
God's not gonna take a call from you.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.622
<i>[Gob]</i>
<i>I did this.</i>

09:24.730 --> 09:27.324
<i>I think that the seal with</i>
<i>the yellow bow tie might be the one...</i>

09:27.433 --> 09:30.664
that I released into the sea after giving it
the taste for mammal blood.

09:30.770 --> 09:33.830
Okay. You've got a better case
than Mom does.

09:33.940 --> 09:36.340
Still, I could hunt down that seal.

09:36.442 --> 09:40.071
They said if you retrieve Buster's hand,
they might be able to do a transplant.

09:40.179 --> 09:43.945
At the very least, I can remove
that incriminating bow tie.

09:44.050 --> 09:47.110
<i>[Narrator] And Michael told Lindsay</i>
<i>about his commitment to Maggie...</i>

09:47.219 --> 09:49.187
<i>and the child that wasn't his.</i>

09:49.288 --> 09:52.587
Well, first of all, I'm sure there are writers
on <i>The Simpsons</i> who aren't geeks.

09:52.692 --> 09:55.627
And secondly, I think this commitment
you're making is great.

09:55.728 --> 09:57.628
It is. It's great, it's great.

09:57.730 --> 10:00.790
I do think something might be up though.
What if she's still lying?

10:00.900 --> 10:03.198
Oh, no. You're trying to
get out of this, aren't you?

10:03.302 --> 10:05.532
- L-I thought you were a good guy.
- I am a good guy.

10:05.638 --> 10:08.698
- Is he trying to get out of having this baby?
- We want this child.

10:08.808 --> 10:11.333
It's given us a reason to stay together.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.038
<i>[Narrator] In fact,</i>
<i>it was investigating the pregnancy...</i>

10:14.146 --> 10:17.877
<i>that had reignited</i>
<i>Lindsay and Tobias's passion.</i>

10:17.984 --> 10:19.952
<i>It was weird.</i>

10:20.052 --> 10:22.020
- Where's your child?
- I don't have a child, Michael.

10:22.121 --> 10:24.589
- We don't have a child, Michael.
- That's why we want-

10:24.690 --> 10:26.851
- [Both] Oh.
- Did you mean Maeby?

10:26.959 --> 10:31.055
- I did mean Maeby.
- Well, she's hardly a child, is she, Michael?

10:31.163 --> 10:33.131
Yeah. And we know where she is.

10:33.232 --> 10:37.066
She's with her debate club, and they're on
their way to Sacremende for the semifinals.

10:37.169 --> 10:39.069
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>She wasn't.</i>

10:39.171 --> 10:43.267
<i>And a Google search of the word</i>
<i>"Sacremende"only came up with this.</i>

10:43.376 --> 10:47.676
<i>In fact, she was overseeing a remake</i>
<i>of</i> The Old Man And The Sea...

10:47.780 --> 10:51.181
<i>for the film studio where she'd</i>
<i>bluffed her way into a job.</i>

10:51.283 --> 10:53.251
What on earth is taking so long?

10:53.352 --> 10:55.877
Am I the only one who wants
to get home and see their kids?

10:55.988 --> 10:58.582
<i>So please don't tell me</i>
<i>I don't know where my kid is.</i>

10:58.691 --> 11:03.025
All I'm saying is that Maggie claims
that no one else is involved.

11:03.129 --> 11:06.030
But what if she's lying again
and there is someone else involved?

11:06.132 --> 11:08.464
You know, a boyfriend, a husband.

11:08.567 --> 11:11.730
Someone that got dumped
when something better came along.

11:11.837 --> 11:15.034
- Of course. Why wouldn't she?
- I'm a good guy, you know.

11:15.141 --> 11:17.609
So I'm thinkin' maybe you can
break into her house again for me...

11:17.710 --> 11:19.439
and see if you can find some, uh-

11:19.545 --> 11:22.105
Way out of this for you?
I don't think so.

11:22.214 --> 11:26.310
No, I was gonna say, find some evidence
of who the father is, but forget it.

11:26.419 --> 11:30.378
I'll find somebody
who wants an adventure.

11:30.489 --> 11:33.583
[Whispering] George Michael, how would
you like to get away from Uncle Buster?

11:33.693 --> 11:35.661
- I'd really like that.
- Good. Shh, shh, shh.

11:35.761 --> 11:38.491
<i>[Narrator] And so, with his son's help,</i>
<i>Michael went to Maggie's...</i>

11:38.597 --> 11:40.531
<i>to find some evidence of another man.</i>

11:40.633 --> 11:43.101
It's another Bluth Boy adventure.
We're like a team.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.534
- We're like Red McGibbon and Bullet.
- Who?

11:45.638 --> 11:47.606
They're this old, uh-
Never mind. Okay, listen.

11:47.707 --> 11:51.143
<i>Anything you find in there-name, phone</i>
<i>number-you bring it out to Daddy, all right?</i>

11:51.243 --> 11:53.234
- You mean you're not going in with me?
- Hmm? No.

11:53.345 --> 11:55.643
I can't fit through that doggy door.

11:55.748 --> 11:59.206
But I am gonna risk being caught out here.
Be careful.

12:00.986 --> 12:04.444
Okay, I got a phone number.
Let's go. Drive.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.718
- Let's go. Hit the gas.
- You didn't even go inside.

12:06.826 --> 12:09.420
- It was taped to the door.
- It's probably the Sparkletts guy.

12:09.528 --> 12:12.827
Listen, it's okay. I'm telling you.
There's nothing to be scared about.

12:12.932 --> 12:15.662
I'm not getting that vibe. Hey!

12:15.768 --> 12:17.736
- Everything all right?
- Yes, Officer.

12:17.837 --> 12:20.328
- Just waiting to see if Maggie's home.
- Oh.

12:20.439 --> 12:23.408
I was making sure there wasn't
another break-in.

12:23.509 --> 12:25.841
My partner is inside
with his gun drawn.

12:25.945 --> 12:28.505
Everything's gonna be just fine.

12:31.317 --> 12:34.343
Close call there, Bullet.
I'm so sorry about that.

12:34.453 --> 12:38.412
<i>But listen, I think</i>- <i>I think that you do have</i>
<i>something here with this phone number.</i>

12:38.524 --> 12:40.549
"Really eager to hear from you."

12:40.659 --> 12:43.787
You know, that's something a guy would say
if he was the father of her child...

12:43.896 --> 12:46.763
and the mother stopped calling
'cause she found a really good guy.

12:46.866 --> 12:50.358
I think this is him. I'm gettin' that vibe.
We're havin' some fun, aren't we?

12:50.469 --> 12:52.198
I'm really sorry about that.

12:52.304 --> 12:56.638
<i>[Narrator] Gob arrived at the dock,</i>
<i>hoping to recover his brother's missing hand.</i>

12:56.742 --> 13:00.269
- I'm lookin' for the seal
that's got the taste for kitty blood.
- [Cats Meowing]

13:00.379 --> 13:02.711
- I'll pay you handsomely.
- [Meowing]

13:02.815 --> 13:06.273
<i>[Narrator] In fact, the skipper had already</i>
<i>rented his boat to be shot in Maeby's film.</i>

13:06.385 --> 13:09.513
- <i>So neither he nor Gob were prepared...</i>
- [Screaming]

13:09.622 --> 13:12.955
- <i>for the challenges of using cats to catch a seal.</i>
- [Cat Howling]

13:13.058 --> 13:17.051
- God! It's like herding cats.
- [Cat Screeches]

13:17.163 --> 13:19.188
Here's your kitty cat. Aah! Fine!

13:19.298 --> 13:21.198
You don't get to be bait!

13:21.300 --> 13:23.268
Why are there cats in the shot?

13:23.369 --> 13:26.861
This is the camera boat.
Can you lose the- [Bleeps] cats, please?

13:26.972 --> 13:28.872
Uncle Gob?

13:30.176 --> 13:32.076
Maeby?

13:32.178 --> 13:35.511
<i>[Narrator] And Michael traced the phone</i>
<i>number he found on the note to an address.</i>

13:35.614 --> 13:38.674
Thank you, Mr. Parmesan. Okay.

13:38.784 --> 13:42.720
In there is the father of the child
that Maggie wants me to help her raise.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.985
<i>And he probably doesn't know</i>
<i>that she's got another man involved.</i>

13:46.091 --> 13:48.924
So I want you to stay here
and enjoy the adventure from the car.

13:49.028 --> 13:52.520
This one could get a little ugly.

13:52.631 --> 13:56.829
And, hey, I'd like to see that cop of Maggie's
do detective work this good. Huh?

13:56.936 --> 13:59.166
- [Knocking]
- [Pop Rock]

13:59.271 --> 14:02.365
Oh, come on.
Is this your phone number?

14:02.474 --> 14:05.739
Hey, I told you at the bar.
I left that on Maggie's door.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.006
And why are you hangin'
around Maggie's house, anyway?

14:08.113 --> 14:10.445
L- I'm sorry.
I'm in this crazy relationship.

14:10.549 --> 14:13.518
She wants me to raise this child with her
because there's no father.

14:13.619 --> 14:15.587
- No father?
- I thought I'd come here-

14:15.688 --> 14:18.350
There's a father.
There's two fathers. David!

14:18.457 --> 14:22.257
- <i>I'm making gravy.</i>
- That bitch is gonna keep our child.

14:22.361 --> 14:26.127
[Gasps]
I knew she was up to something.

14:26.232 --> 14:28.792
<i>Hot cops</i>
<i>[Hisses] Hot</i>

14:32.171 --> 14:36.073
<i>[Narrator] Michael had tracked down the</i>
<i>couple who'd hired Maggie to carry their child.</i>

14:36.175 --> 14:39.702
- So that's why you guys are staking out her house.
- <i>She hasn't returned our calls.</i>

14:39.812 --> 14:42.474
- There's something about her I just don't trust.
- <i>I'll say.</i>

14:42.581 --> 14:44.947
She said she doesn't know
who the father is.

14:45.050 --> 14:48.144
<i>In a funny way, neither do we.</i>
<i>Wejust gave her a mixed cocktail.</i>

14:48.254 --> 14:50.154
- Two parts Taylor.
- Two parts Carter.

14:50.256 --> 14:52.156
And let her do her thing.

14:52.258 --> 14:55.421
<i>We decided we never want to know</i>
<i>which of us is the real father.</i>

14:58.130 --> 15:00.030
Well, why should you?

15:00.132 --> 15:03.295
I just hope you find out which one of you
can breast-feed. [Chuckles]

15:03.402 --> 15:06.098
You know,
we're in a loving relationship.

15:06.205 --> 15:09.606
<i>Andjust because we don't have breasts</i>
<i>does not mean we cannot nourish our child.</i>

15:09.708 --> 15:11.608
<i>I'm sorry. I didn't mean to-</i>

15:11.710 --> 15:14.679
I don't want you guys to worry about
getting that child back from Maggie...

15:14.780 --> 15:17.010
because I'm gonna help you.

15:17.116 --> 15:19.175
Wow. What a... good guy.

15:19.285 --> 15:22.948
I know. And for once,
I'm one lie ahead of Maggie Lizer's lies.

15:23.055 --> 15:25.785
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>In fact, Michael was one lie behind her.</i>

15:25.891 --> 15:30.419
<i>And what if I told you</i>
<i>that Loretta was not fat...</i>

15:30.529 --> 15:32.963
but actually a very greedy woman...

15:33.065 --> 15:36.125
in a very cheap fat suit?

15:36.235 --> 15:38.760
<i>What, do you think I'm kidding?</i>
<i>Huh?</i>

15:38.871 --> 15:41.840
- What are you doing?
- Okay, so she's fat.

15:41.941 --> 15:45.707
- Your Honor, this is an outrage!
- Wow. Did I lose this one.

15:45.811 --> 15:48.279
Mr. Zuckerkorn,
you've been warned about touching.

15:48.380 --> 15:51.713
- You said spanking.
- I want this case thrown out immediately.

15:51.817 --> 15:54.547
- [Grunts]
- <i>[Narrator] In fact, Loretta wasn't overweight</i>- 

15:54.653 --> 15:58.282
- Oh, no! My water just broke!
- Quickly, Your Honor. Quickly throw it out.

15:58.390 --> 16:01.325
<i>[Narrator] but was carrying the child</i>
<i>that Maggie was supposed to.</i>

16:01.427 --> 16:06.524
<i>You see, it was Loretta's urine that</i>
<i>Tobias and Lindsay ended up testing...</i>

16:06.632 --> 16:10.227
<i>a fact they missed when they were</i>
<i>making out in the shower.</i>

16:10.336 --> 16:13.237
<i>And Maggie did buy the fat suit</i>
<i>to serve as her pregnancy belly.</i>

16:13.339 --> 16:15.239
All right, this is goin' back.

16:15.341 --> 16:20.074
<i>[Narrator] But soon upgraded</i>
<i>to a higher-quality latex model.</i>

<i>[Loretta]</i>
<i>It's time!</i>

- <i>Is there a doctor in the house?</i>
- Oh, my God! My water broke too!

16:26.118 --> 16:28.018
I'm in labor!

16:28.120 --> 16:32.989
<i>[Narrator] Maggie wasn't, but had no choice</i>
<i>but to pretend to deliver at the same time.</i>

16:33.092 --> 16:36.220
<i>And Gob caught up with Maeby</i>
<i>and made a confession.</i>

16:36.328 --> 16:38.489
I think I'm responsible
for Buster's hand.

16:38.597 --> 16:41.361
Yeah, and I'm responsible for
an $80-million movie without an ending.

16:41.467 --> 16:44.095
I know those problems seem big
when you're a kid, Maeby.

16:44.203 --> 16:46.797
Look, this is kind of weird
advice for me to be giving...

16:46.905 --> 16:49.032
but why don't you
just tell him the truth?

16:49.141 --> 16:51.041
I mean, he'll respect you for it.

16:52.144 --> 16:54.669
Thanks, Maeby.

16:54.780 --> 16:57.613
Okay, now I'm just lying
for no reason.

16:59.818 --> 17:02.048
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And Michael arrived at the courthouse...</i>

<i>And back at the penthouse, Lucille was</i>

Oh! No, stop it, stop it, stop it!

17:26.244 --> 17:29.510

Hi. There's something

There's nothing he needs to know.
Take his hand. Take it now!

It was my fault. It was my seal.

17:58.043 --> 18:00.637

Wow. Truth feels good.

- I'm not pregnant.
- But we paid you to do this, Maggie.

I know, and I wanted to, but then
it turns out I couldn't get pregnant.

19:14.119 --> 19:17.919

So l-
Hey, I outsourced it, okay?
