00:00.401 --> 00:03.771
[whoosh]

00:03.871 --> 00:07.741
[theme music]

00:46.214 --> 00:49.583
[roseanne laughs]

00:54.755 --> 00:55.756
Hey, girls.

00:55.856 --> 00:59.160
JACKIE: Pete, please,
we're trying to eat.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.528
Jackie, you oughta
be in a better mood.

01:00.628 --> 01:02.230
It's Friday.

01:02.330 --> 01:03.997
So what are you
girls doing tonight?

01:04.098 --> 01:06.033
Well, we were going to
go out and try to find

01:06.134 --> 01:07.335
some dimwitted bald guys.

01:10.438 --> 01:11.905
Was that supposed to mean me?

01:12.005 --> 01:14.007
What are you gonna do, Pete?

01:14.108 --> 01:19.313
Gonna go out and redefine the
word "manhood" for some woman.

01:19.413 --> 01:23.684
Well, you know, you've
already redefined it for me.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.286
You wish.

01:25.386 --> 01:26.987
[laughs]

01:27.087 --> 01:29.157
SYLVIA: I could use
some manhood myself.

01:29.257 --> 01:30.224
Sylvia.

01:30.324 --> 01:31.225
Well, what am I?

01:31.325 --> 01:33.527
Dead?

01:33.627 --> 01:38.166
There's still some tread
in these old tires,

01:38.266 --> 01:40.067
Well, it would be
fun to go out tonight.

01:40.168 --> 01:40.968
Fun?

01:41.068 --> 01:42.102
Hell, it's a necessity.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.704
We should go dancing.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.206
Let's drive out to
The Night Monkey.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.740
Oh, I've never been there.

01:46.840 --> 01:47.975
Is it nice?

01:48.075 --> 01:50.644
Oh, it's a real class joint.

01:50.744 --> 01:54.148
You can meet men there
from the finest prisons.

01:54.248 --> 01:55.816
Then you have a better idea?

01:55.916 --> 01:56.750
Don't I always?

01:56.850 --> 01:57.751
Let's hear it.

01:57.851 --> 01:58.719
Well, it's kind of wild.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.120
JACKIE: What?

02:00.221 --> 02:01.822
Well, it's something you never
think about in a million years.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.023
JACKIE: What?
- Bowling.

02:03.123 --> 02:03.924
No.

02:04.024 --> 02:05.259
No way.

02:05.359 --> 02:06.794
Come on.
It's be a blast.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.229
- For who?
- For me.

02:08.329 --> 02:09.397
Yeah, for you.

02:09.497 --> 02:10.998
Every time we go bowling,
it's the same thing.

02:11.098 --> 02:13.567
You screw around and you
mess up everybody's game.

02:13.667 --> 02:14.535
She's right.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.537
You have no respect
for the sport.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.438
Oh, come on.

02:17.538 --> 02:18.872
I love bowling.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.541
It's the perfect workout--

02:20.641 --> 02:25.213
six seconds of exercise,
drink beer a half an hour.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.314
See what I mean?

02:26.414 --> 02:30.017
All you ever do is poop
all over the sport.

02:30.117 --> 02:31.285
Come on, Crystal.

02:31.385 --> 02:33.487
I really need an excuse to
get Dan out of the house.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.356
Otherwise, he's going to
make me sit there with him

02:35.456 --> 02:37.325
and watch Big Time Wrestling.

02:37.425 --> 02:38.859
Oh, I forgot that
was on tonight.

02:38.959 --> 02:41.629
Sonny Boy Crusher takes
on Mike the Mangler?

02:41.729 --> 02:45.333
There's no way I'm
gonna miss that.

02:45.433 --> 02:46.667
Hey, what about you, Booker?

02:46.767 --> 02:47.868
You want to go bowling?
- What?

02:47.968 --> 02:49.169
Are you kidding?

02:49.270 --> 02:50.070
No, for reals.

02:50.170 --> 02:50.971
You want to go?

02:51.071 --> 02:52.072
Who else is going?

02:52.172 --> 02:53.173
I am.

02:53.274 --> 02:54.308
Oh, yeah.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.544
Jackie's been begging me
all day to go with her.

02:56.644 --> 02:57.445
[jackie clears throat]

02:57.545 --> 02:59.280
You going to beg me?

02:59.380 --> 03:00.414
It's Friday night, Booker.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.582
I thought you'd have plans.

03:01.682 --> 03:02.716
Yeah, I do, actually.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.518
I'm going bowling with you.

03:04.618 --> 03:05.453
Great.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.288
See, Crystal, now
we're all going.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.322
What are you gonna do?

03:08.422 --> 03:10.858
Sit home and check
the expiration dates

03:10.958 --> 03:12.092
on all your dairy products?

03:16.096 --> 03:17.365
All right, I'll go.

03:17.465 --> 03:20.601
But Roseanne, you gotta
promise to behave yourself.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.936
I promise to be
on my best Friday

03:23.036 --> 03:25.105
night behavior,
Crystal, bowler's honor.

03:30.678 --> 03:31.579
Come on, everybody.

03:31.679 --> 03:32.480
Let's go!

03:32.580 --> 03:35.015
Shake a leg!

03:35.115 --> 03:36.016
[roseanne growls]

03:36.116 --> 03:37.217
DAN: Get it?

03:37.318 --> 03:38.185
Yeah.

03:38.286 --> 03:39.219
It's going to
work out fine, babe.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.421
We're going to get
home just in time

03:40.521 --> 03:42.623
to see Snake Man take
on the Human Clamp.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.658
Oh, that reminds
me of our honeymoon.

03:51.732 --> 03:52.533
We need money.

03:52.633 --> 03:53.901
Yeah, give us our money.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.102
Your money?

03:55.202 --> 03:56.337
I don't care
whose money it is.

03:56.437 --> 03:57.371
Just give it to us.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.740
Well, not till we
here the magic word.

03:59.840 --> 04:03.344
- "Now?"
- Ooh!

04:03.444 --> 04:05.946
No, the magic word.

04:06.046 --> 04:08.282
Please?

04:08.382 --> 04:10.284
What beautiful,
obedient children.

04:10.384 --> 04:13.020
Pay them off.

04:13.120 --> 04:13.921
How much?

04:14.021 --> 04:14.822
Five bucks a hit.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.357
[hisses]

04:16.457 --> 04:19.360
Yeah, here you go, five
smackeroonies a piece.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.629
And that's it for tonight and
don't come crying for more.

04:21.729 --> 04:23.831
And DJ, don't draw
on it this time.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.633
DARLENE: I get the front seat!
DJ: No, you don't!

04:25.733 --> 04:27.335
- Yes, I do!
- No, you don't!

04:27.435 --> 04:28.469
Uh-huh!

04:28.569 --> 04:31.104
Five bucks apiece for
them little beggars--

04:31.204 --> 04:32.205
that's a lot of money.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.107
Yeah, but, you know,
look at it this way.

04:34.207 --> 04:36.944
For five bucks, they're
out of our hair all night.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.312
Well, hell, let's
give them each $100.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.713
Maybe they'll move to Cleveland.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.251
Becky, come on!

04:44.352 --> 04:48.121
Yeah, get a move on
before my hand cools down.

04:48.221 --> 04:49.189
Your what?

04:49.289 --> 04:50.157
Feel this, baby.

04:50.257 --> 04:51.859
There's a 200-point
game pulsating

04:51.959 --> 04:54.227
through these fingers.

04:54.328 --> 04:56.029
Let's not waste it on bowling.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.470
Mom, DJ took the front
seat and it's not his turn.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.071
All right.
That's it.

05:04.171 --> 05:05.072
In the trunk with both of you.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.644
What's taking Becky so long?

05:10.744 --> 05:13.080
Puberty.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.816
She's getting dressed
up for her boyfriend.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.619
ROSEANNE: What boyfriend?
- Chip.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.421
Chip who?

05:20.521 --> 05:23.691
You know, $5 really
doesn't go that far.

05:23.791 --> 05:27.495
Well, neither does a little
girl with two broken legs.

05:27.595 --> 05:30.564
Pumpkin, I'd hate to
see you hobbling around

05:30.664 --> 05:32.132
for the rest of your life.

05:32.232 --> 05:33.401
Now, who's this Chip guy?

05:33.501 --> 05:34.301
Give.

05:34.402 --> 05:35.202
He-- all right.

05:35.302 --> 05:36.870
He works at the bowling alley.

05:36.970 --> 05:39.640
Oh, he's not that tattooed guy
that sweeps up the parking lot,

05:39.740 --> 05:40.841
is he?

05:40.941 --> 05:41.975
No.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.343
He goes to school with
Becky on the weekdays

05:43.444 --> 05:46.013
and only works at the bowling
alley on the weekends.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.048
She's got the
major hots for him.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.984
Oh, she does, does she?

05:51.084 --> 05:51.885
Whoa.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.221
Whoa, look at you.

05:54.321 --> 05:56.557
Oh, are we going to be
working the lounge tonight?

05:59.827 --> 06:02.430
So what are you all dressed
up for just to go bowling?

06:02.530 --> 06:03.764
Any particular reason?

06:06.400 --> 06:07.200
No.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.402
Well, what about Chip?

06:08.502 --> 06:09.837
Chip, Chip, Chip, Chip, Chip--

06:09.937 --> 06:11.639
- Shut up!
- Chip!

06:11.739 --> 06:13.707
Darlene, I'm going to kill
you and burn everything you own!

06:13.807 --> 06:15.409
Oh, come here, you.
Come here.

06:15.509 --> 06:16.143
Come here.
Come here.

06:16.243 --> 06:17.511
What?

06:17.611 --> 06:21.415
Tell us about this stud we're
going to be meeting tonight.

06:21.515 --> 06:23.617
Mother, you're not
going to meet him.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.218
Well, we're going to
be at the bowling alley

06:25.318 --> 06:28.622
and Chip's going to be
at the bowling alley.

06:31.358 --> 06:33.293
(SOUTHERN ACCENT) We're bound
to run into one another.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.399
Please don't embarrass me.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.568
Please.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.069
(SOUTHERN ACCENT) Oh,
honey, there's no way

06:42.169 --> 06:43.270
we'd embarrass you.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.511
Please?

06:50.611 --> 06:54.014
If you really love me, you'll
pretend you're not my parents.

06:54.114 --> 06:54.982
All right.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.717
Get out of our
house, little girl.

06:56.817 --> 06:57.618
Thank you.

07:01.955 --> 07:06.359
So little Becky has got
her first boyfriend, huh?

07:06.460 --> 07:08.261
Oh, I wonder what
this guy is like.

07:08.361 --> 07:09.262
Oh, come on, Rosie.

07:09.362 --> 07:10.831
You know girls always
go for guys that

07:10.931 --> 07:13.266
remind them of their fathers.

07:13.366 --> 07:14.535
Not if they listen
to their mothers.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.439
SOUTHERN ACCENT)
Come here, baby.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.708
Give Snake Man a little kiss.

07:23.677 --> 07:24.545
All right, Becky.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.880
Where is this Romeo?

07:26.980 --> 07:28.816
Now, you promise
you're not my parents.

07:28.916 --> 07:29.817
You don't know me.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.018
You've never seen me.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.653
(SOUTHERN ACCENT) That's
right, Rose of Sharon.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.455
We swore a oath.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.825
Just give me my
money and I'll go.

07:37.925 --> 07:41.895
We don't give
money to strangers.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.363
Mother!

07:43.463 --> 07:44.598
Oh, all right.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.366
Now here, don't elope with this.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.835
Thanks.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.803
What size shoe
do you wear, Dan?

07:49.903 --> 07:50.704
11.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.140
11, a very common size.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.042
I bet you five different
men wear those bowling

07:55.142 --> 07:57.845
shoes every day, five
men who bowl and sweat

07:57.945 --> 07:59.813
and have who knows what
kind of hygiene habits.

08:03.050 --> 08:07.755
Cryssa, would you stop
flirting with my old man?

08:07.855 --> 08:08.656
She's right, Rosie.

08:08.756 --> 08:09.690
These are kind of grungy.

08:09.790 --> 08:10.858
Check them out.

08:10.958 --> 08:11.892
Now, look.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.126
There's some kind
of fungus in there!

08:13.226 --> 08:14.027
Get it away!

08:14.127 --> 08:15.128
You're making me sick.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.930
You can't see fungus.

08:17.030 --> 08:20.100
I think that's that good
luck mold they stick in them.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.869
This looks like
the party lane.

08:21.969 --> 08:22.903
I'm here, Dan.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.337
You can start having fun.

08:24.437 --> 08:27.107
They didn't tell
me it was scag night.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.076
Hey, you got your
own shoes, huh?

08:29.176 --> 08:31.078
Yeah, I don't use
those rented things, Dan.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.012
They're loaded with germs.

08:35.616 --> 08:38.686
Roseanne, you're supposed to
put your shoes under the bench.

08:38.786 --> 08:39.987
Says who?

08:40.087 --> 08:42.222
Well, it's just
part of good bowling.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.725
See-- see, all the league
bowlers place their shoes

08:44.825 --> 08:45.759
neatly under the bench.

08:51.599 --> 08:54.101
You could never be in a league.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.535
Come on, baby.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.137
Let's us go pick
out a couple balls.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.205
Oh, you pick me one out.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.573
No, no, Roseanne.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.308
You gotta pick out your own
ball so you get the proper fit.

09:01.408 --> 09:02.209
Now, now, come on.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.110
I'll help you.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.544
ROSEANNE: Oh, this is work!

09:04.645 --> 09:06.413
You any good at this game?

09:06.513 --> 09:07.615
Yeah, I'm pretty good.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.583
You know, I haven't
played in a long time,

09:09.683 --> 09:12.152
but I used to be a high scorer.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.454
We're talking about
bowling, Booker.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.089
That, too.

09:16.189 --> 09:19.426
So you-- you care to
make a friendly wager?

09:19.526 --> 09:20.728
Yeah.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.029
BOOKER: All right.

09:22.129 --> 09:27.167
If I win, then you have to
spend the night at my place.

09:27.267 --> 09:30.137
That's pretty friendly.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.939
Well, if the stakes are
too high, you just say so.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.407
Well, it sounds
like a one-sided bet.

09:34.507 --> 09:35.508
Actually, no.

09:35.609 --> 09:38.779
See, because if you
lose, then we both win.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.714
I've got a 160
average, Booker.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.015
There's no way you're
going to beat me.

09:42.115 --> 09:42.549
All right.
All right.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.317
What if you win?

09:44.417 --> 09:47.821
Then you spend the
night at my place?

09:47.921 --> 09:48.856
Sounds good.

09:48.956 --> 09:49.757
Scrubbing my bathroom.

09:51.725 --> 09:52.525
All right.

09:52.626 --> 09:54.361
Whatever gets you in the mood.

09:54.461 --> 09:55.996
Is that a bet?

09:56.096 --> 09:57.097
Yeah.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.131
Yeah.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.133
Oh, I love you guys' shirts.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.569
Didn't you have a hit record
out the year I was born?

10:07.307 --> 10:09.076
Come on, you guys.
Warm-up frame.

10:09.176 --> 10:10.077
All right, Danny.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.044
Come on, Danny.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.252
Dan, Dan, he's our man!

10:19.352 --> 10:21.188
If he can't do it, no one can!

10:21.288 --> 10:22.122
Hey!

10:22.222 --> 10:23.156
Hey!

10:23.256 --> 10:24.057
All right.

10:24.157 --> 10:24.958
All right.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.860
All right.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.428
Hey, everybody,
quiet, would you?

10:28.528 --> 10:30.263
Can't you see somebody's
trying to bowl here?

10:44.812 --> 10:47.681
[pins clattering]

10:55.255 --> 10:56.089
Dan, you're up.
Let's go.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.257
Come on, Danny.

10:57.357 --> 11:00.828
Go ahead and show us
that special gutter ball.

11:00.928 --> 11:02.429
This is it, history
in the making.

11:02.529 --> 11:06.333
Dan Conner is on his
way to a 200 game.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.201
[exhales]

11:08.301 --> 11:09.669
Check the score lately?

11:09.770 --> 11:11.104
I know the score, Booker.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.073
What am I up, 10, 20 pins?

11:13.173 --> 11:14.674
It's very early in the game.

11:14.775 --> 11:15.843
I know, but I
am bowling better

11:15.943 --> 11:17.310
than I ever have in my life.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.211
Why do you think that is.

11:18.311 --> 11:21.081
[ball rolling]

11:21.181 --> 11:22.082
[pins clattering]
- Yes!

11:22.182 --> 11:22.983
Yeah!

11:23.083 --> 11:23.917
Danny!

11:24.017 --> 11:25.352
JACKIE: Yeah, Danny!
- Danny!

11:25.452 --> 11:26.286
JACKIE: Yeah!

11:26.386 --> 11:29.389
Oh, you are sizzling!

11:29.489 --> 11:30.791
Book, you're up.

11:34.828 --> 11:37.430
Hey, what's going on
with you and Booker?

11:37.530 --> 11:38.598
Nothing.

11:38.698 --> 11:42.569
Oh, that's why he's
drooling all over himself.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.404
We made a bet.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.306
What kind of bet?

11:46.406 --> 11:49.409
A friendly bet.

11:49.509 --> 11:52.412
How friendly?

11:52.512 --> 11:55.648
Extremely friendly.

11:55.749 --> 12:00.720
Where was I when mom and dad
were dropping you on your head?

12:00.821 --> 12:02.089
It's fine.

12:02.189 --> 12:04.557
He's been lucky so far, but
his game's about to fall apart.

12:04.657 --> 12:06.526
[ball rolling]

12:06.626 --> 12:07.427
[pins clattering]

12:07.527 --> 12:08.328
Whoo!

12:08.428 --> 12:09.329
Some bet!

12:09.429 --> 12:10.831
Yeah, he's crumbling.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.699
He only knocked down--

12:12.800 --> 12:17.537
he only knocked down,
what, 10 pins on that one?

12:17.637 --> 12:18.438
DAN: Roseanne?

12:18.538 --> 12:20.207
It's your turn.

12:20.307 --> 12:21.541
I just bowled 20 minutes ago.

12:21.641 --> 12:22.442
Get up there.

12:26.479 --> 12:27.347
Honey?

12:27.447 --> 12:29.316
ROSEANNE: What?

12:29.416 --> 12:30.984
If you manage to
knock down one pin,

12:31.084 --> 12:34.888
I'll be your love
slave for life.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.223
Yeah, but what do I win?

12:41.228 --> 12:44.097
[laurie laughs]

12:47.134 --> 12:49.002
[gutter clatters]

12:49.102 --> 12:50.537
Honey, that was sensational.

12:50.637 --> 12:52.439
You managed to keep
it in our lane.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.611
Hey, Darlene, whatcha doing?

12:58.711 --> 13:00.013
What are you doing here?

13:00.113 --> 13:03.650
Oh, I'm looking for Chip.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.418
I gotta go to the ladies room.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.424
OK, Darlene, where is he?

13:11.524 --> 13:13.961
I promised Becky
I wouldn't tell.

13:14.061 --> 13:15.762
Well, you'd better
tell me, Darlene,

13:15.863 --> 13:18.798
or I'm going to have
to start dancing.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.467
Mom, no.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.937
Oh, right here in front
of all your friends.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.907
Hear that music!

13:27.007 --> 13:28.876
Mom, please!

13:28.976 --> 13:30.343
Oh, I can't stop myself.

13:30.443 --> 13:33.746
I must dance!

13:33.847 --> 13:37.617
OK, OK, you win.

13:37.717 --> 13:40.687
Chip's the guy
behind the counter.

13:40.787 --> 13:41.955
ROSEANNE: The blond?

13:42.055 --> 13:43.023
Yes.

13:43.123 --> 13:44.357
Oh, he's cute!

13:44.457 --> 13:46.093
Don't tell Becky I told you.

13:46.193 --> 13:49.062
Oh, honey, you know
I'm smarter than that.

13:49.162 --> 13:53.766
I'll just hold it over your
head for the rest of your life.

13:53.867 --> 13:55.869
Ahem.

13:55.969 --> 14:00.007
So how's this bet between
you and Booker going?

14:00.107 --> 14:06.079
Booker is beating the
pants off of me, literally.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.948

14:08.048 --> 14:09.049
Hurry up.
Hurry up.

14:09.149 --> 14:09.950
Hurry up.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.485
Oh, so close.

14:12.585 --> 14:13.386
Come on, Danny.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.155
You can spare.

14:15.255 --> 14:16.223
You got it.

14:16.323 --> 14:18.892
Oh, Booker's really
on a roll, Roseanne.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.293
Oh, well, all we
gotta do is just,

14:20.393 --> 14:21.394
like, break his concentration.

14:21.494 --> 14:22.595
That's all.
- Yeah.

14:22.695 --> 14:23.730
We break his concentration.
Right.

14:23.830 --> 14:25.966
Yeah.
You can handle it.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.300
Yes.

14:27.400 --> 14:31.638
And once again, I will save
you from your pitiful self.

Yes!

14:39.246 --> 14:40.047
Aruga!

14:44.117 --> 14:47.554
Iceman Dan Conner has picked
up that difficult spare,

14:47.654 --> 14:49.022
and let's see it
again in slow motion.

15:05.105 --> 15:05.905
A-ru-ga!

15:14.414 --> 15:16.316
Hey, can I be your
bowling groupie?

15:16.416 --> 15:18.318
Take a number.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.452
BOOKER: All right, Jackie.

15:19.552 --> 15:22.522
Watch carefully as I put
the game out of reach.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.961
Booker, you get that
infection cleared up?

15:36.336 --> 15:38.505
I have got to go over
there and talk to him.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.140
Then go.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.142
Darlene, you don't understand.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.844
You don't just walk up to a
guy and start talking to him.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.246
No, you hide
behind a video game

15:46.346 --> 15:47.847
I like drooling like a geek.

15:50.817 --> 15:52.952
I have to figure out
exactly what to say.

15:53.053 --> 15:53.853
Go buy some popcorn.

15:56.990 --> 15:57.890
All right, this is it.

15:57.991 --> 15:58.791
Here I go.

Hi.

How are you doing?

16:22.182 --> 16:22.982
Oh, fine.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.820
How you doing?

16:27.920 --> 16:30.190
Fine.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.592
So you're working tonight?

16:32.692 --> 16:33.793
Yeah.

16:33.893 --> 16:35.995
I was supposed to go to
the Steel Vipers concert.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.997
My mom said I couldn't go
unless she came with me.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.532
I told her to forget it.

16:39.632 --> 16:41.534
Parents are so uncool.

16:41.634 --> 16:42.935
They won't let you
go anywhere alone.

16:43.036 --> 16:43.836

16:43.936 --> 16:44.937
Your parents here tonight?

16:45.038 --> 16:45.838
No way.

16:45.938 --> 16:47.640
They just dropped me off.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.377
I'm here by myself.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.445
Do you sell pretzels here?

16:56.949 --> 16:58.318

- No, wait.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.019
You don't have to leave.
I'll just be a second.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.088

Sit down.

17:01.188 --> 17:03.190
OK.

Oh, why don't
you finish waiting

17:04.624 --> 17:08.228
on this beautiful young woman?

17:08.328 --> 17:09.129
No, that's OK.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.430
You can wait on her.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.598
Oh, you're so kind.

17:14.901 --> 17:18.671
Listen, give me two pretzels
and two beef jerkies.

17:18.771 --> 17:19.572
OK.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.574
Coming up.

Nice weather
we're having, huh?

17:29.782 --> 17:31.017
You want any sodas
to go with that?

17:31.118 --> 17:31.918
No.

17:32.018 --> 17:33.486
The snacks are just fineroonie.

17:36.323 --> 17:39.459
So, you like working here, Chip?

17:39.559 --> 17:40.993
CHIP: Yeah, It's OK, I guess.

17:41.094 --> 17:42.629
What do they pay you?

17:42.729 --> 17:44.497
Enough.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.199
You going to be
working here forever?

17:46.299 --> 17:47.234
No.

17:47.334 --> 17:48.168
I get off at 9:00.

18:02.882 --> 18:04.751

she bought was pretzels.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.486
That was real cool.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.921
Yeah, real cool.

18:09.021 --> 18:11.191
Hey, look at what I found.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.359
Where did you find it?

18:12.459 --> 18:15.495
Stuck to a video machine.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.398
What have you got
in your pocket?

18:18.498 --> 18:20.300
Ice cream sandwich.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.734
ROSEANNE: Smart move.

18:21.834 --> 18:24.171
I was saving it for later.

18:26.639 --> 18:27.874
Game's already in the bag.

This is just a formality.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.278
Shut up and bowl.

What's the matter
with you, honey?

18:35.548 --> 18:39.619
Well, they just oughta take
you outside and shoot ya.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.521
I'm never gonna
play this game again.

18:41.621 --> 18:42.755
Yes, you are, honey.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.924
You'll do it again next
week, and you'll be just as

18:45.024 --> 18:46.226
annoying as you were tonight.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.595
[pins clattering]
- Oh, yeah.

18:48.695 --> 18:49.496
Good one, Booker.

18:49.596 --> 18:50.530
Good All right, Roseanne.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.764
You're up.

18:51.864 --> 18:52.999
That's it.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.133
Read them and weep.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.135
Did you really think
I was going to pay up?

18:56.236 --> 18:57.470
Yes.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.306
Would you really want
me there against my will?

18:59.406 --> 19:01.774
Absolutely.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.776
All right, Booker.
A bet's a bet.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.578
That's right.
What?

19:05.678 --> 19:06.879
Would it be so bad?

19:06.979 --> 19:08.047
JACKIE: What?

19:08.147 --> 19:09.416
You know, spending
the night with me.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.451
Would that be such
a horrible thing?

19:11.551 --> 19:12.385
Might be nice.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.286
Yeah.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.188
Just nice?

19:15.288 --> 19:16.889
It would be incredible.

19:20.327 --> 19:23.062
Yeah, it would be incredible.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.498
Not tonight.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.400
What?

19:27.500 --> 19:29.302
Not on a bet.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.803
Not tonight, and not on a bet.

19:36.909 --> 19:37.710
You welcher!

19:40.280 --> 19:41.881
Come on, Roseanne.
Would you get up there?

19:41.981 --> 19:42.782
It's the last frame.

19:42.882 --> 19:43.750
[roseanne groans]

19:43.850 --> 19:45.151

CRYSTAL: OK.

19:47.086 --> 19:47.887
All right.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.689
What's my score?

19:49.789 --> 19:51.358
Uh, let's see.

19:51.458 --> 19:52.259
Seven.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.166
What inning is it?

20:04.036 --> 20:04.937
Get up there and bowl.

20:05.037 --> 20:05.905
Come on up there.

20:06.005 --> 20:06.873
Go on.

20:06.973 --> 20:07.774
Come on!

20:07.874 --> 20:11.244
Na, na, na, na.

20:11.344 --> 20:16.015
Oh, well, you can razz me all
you like, but I am unshakable.

20:16.115 --> 20:16.983
DAN: Oh, yeah.

20:17.083 --> 20:17.884
Yeah.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.355
I can get a strike
anytime I want.

20:22.455 --> 20:23.323
CRYSTAL: Yeah!
Yeah!

20:23.423 --> 20:24.691
How's that?

20:24.791 --> 20:29.296
I pretend like the pins are
the kids and this is your head.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.797
Have at it.

20:30.897 --> 20:34.301
[ululating]

20:37.870 --> 20:41.741
[pins clattering]

20:49.282 --> 20:50.517
ANNOUNCER (ON TV):
And it's a body blast

20:50.617 --> 20:52.018
and the Human Clamp goes down--

20:52.118 --> 20:53.920
Oh, it's all over now.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.121
Snake Man's got it wrapped up--

20:55.221 --> 20:56.456
ANNOUNCER (ON TV):
Incredible, the Human

20:56.556 --> 20:57.857
Clamp undefeated in 47--

20:57.957 --> 20:58.991
You know, this
is like all-male

20:59.091 --> 21:03.563
porno except for they're
wearing bathing suits.

21:03.663 --> 21:06.098
[grunting]

21:06.198 --> 21:08.067
Yeah, I was a pretty good
wrestler in junior high school.

21:08.167 --> 21:10.036
Coach used to call me
"Damaging Dan Conner."

21:10.136 --> 21:13.239
God, don't make me listen
to that boring story again.

21:13.340 --> 21:14.474
ANNOUNCER (ON TV):
Now he follows

21:14.574 --> 21:15.508
that up with a vicious triple--

21:15.608 --> 21:16.876
Oh.
Oh!

21:16.976 --> 21:18.478
Oh, look out, ladies
and gentlemen.

21:18.578 --> 21:19.846
It's a front suplex.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.748
No.
He's got her over.

21:21.848 --> 21:22.882
He's going for it.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.250
He's going for the figure four.

21:24.351 --> 21:25.985
He's bouncing up the ropes!

21:26.085 --> 21:28.621
Ladies and gentlemen,
can he by the door?

21:28.721 --> 21:29.622
Look out!

21:29.722 --> 21:30.657
Holy cow!

21:30.757 --> 21:32.058
He's setting her up
for a heart punch.

21:32.158 --> 21:32.959
Oh!

21:33.059 --> 21:34.561
It's illegal in 30 states.

21:34.661 --> 21:36.228
Holy cow, ladies and gentlemen.

21:36.329 --> 21:39.031
Iceman Dan Conner's
gone berserk!

21:39.131 --> 21:39.999
He's setting her up.

21:40.099 --> 21:41.334
He's got her.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.436
1, 2, 3.

21:43.536 --> 21:44.337
Do you quit?

21:44.437 --> 21:45.538
One more.

21:45.638 --> 21:46.439
Four.

21:46.539 --> 21:48.240
[hisses]

21:48.341 --> 21:50.343
[theme music]

21:55.548 --> 21:58.785
[whoosh]
