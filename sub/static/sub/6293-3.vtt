00:09.643 --> 00:11.712
(Tara)
PREVIOUSLY, ON
UNITED STATES OF TARA...

00:11.745 --> 00:13.214
LOOK, WE KNEW
WHEN YOU WENT OFF THE MEDS

00:13.247 --> 00:14.648
THE WHOLE GANG
WOULD RESURFACE.

00:14.682 --> 00:17.285
I HATE YOU
FOR NOT FUCKING ME.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.087
I AM BUCK,
AND I WILL FUCK YOU SIDEWAYS.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.621
WAIT.

00:20.654 --> 00:22.823
I'M HAVING A MULTIPLE
PERSONALITY REUNION TOUR.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.059
IT IS REALLY HARD FOR ME
TO SEE MY SISTER LIKE THAT.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.527
IT'S NOT EVEN
A REAL DISEASE, MAX.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.229
I THINK IT'S UNFAIR
THAT YOU GOTTA DO ALL THE WORK.

00:28.262 --> 00:29.830
CAN'T TARA
DO SOME OF IT?

00:29.863 --> 00:32.133
TOMORROW, I'M GONNA TALK
TO MARSY'S TEACHER.

00:32.166 --> 00:34.168
WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT--
WE JUST THOUGHT
A MAN-TO-MAN THING

00:34.202 --> 00:35.469
MIGHT BE THE WAY
TO PLAY THIS GUY.

00:35.503 --> 00:36.470
KNOCK, KNOCK.

00:36.504 --> 00:39.073
ROOM FOR ONE MORE?

00:39.107 --> 00:40.708
OH, MY GOD.
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.
OH, PIFFLE.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.710
YOU'RE PROMISCUOUS.
YOU AREN'T GUARDING YOUR FLOWER.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.345
YOU MEAN A SLUT?

00:44.378 --> 00:47.415
A GIRL WHO SUCKS
AND FUCKS?

00:47.448 --> 00:49.483
I'M GOING TO WASH
YOUR MOUTH OUT WITH SOAP.

00:49.517 --> 00:51.385
[muffled gasping]

00:51.419 --> 00:52.420
HEY!

00:52.453 --> 00:53.687
OH, GOD.
I WANT OUT.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.489
ARE YOU HIRING?

00:55.523 --> 00:57.358
I'D LIKE TO FILL OUT
AN APPLICATION.

00:57.391 --> 01:00.161
I'M SORRY ABOUT ALICE,
BUT, HONEY, THAT'S CRAZY.

01:00.194 --> 01:03.164
MAYBE FROM NOW ON, LET ME
DOLE OUT THE PUNISHMENT, OKAY?

01:03.197 --> 01:06.167
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO HELP.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.369
DON'T YOU WANT
TO MAKE A BABY?

01:08.402 --> 01:09.837
NO.

01:13.874 --> 01:16.844
[whimsical melody]

01:16.877 --> 01:20.581
*

01:20.614 --> 01:23.517
* OPEN UP THE SKY

01:23.551 --> 01:27.221
* THIS MESS IS GETTING HIGH

01:27.255 --> 01:33.627
* IT'S WINDY
AND HER FAMILY NEEDS A RIDE *

01:33.661 --> 01:38.532
* I KNOW WE'LL BE
JUST FINE *

01:38.566 --> 01:41.402
* WHEN WE LEARN
TO LOVE THE RIDE *

01:41.435 --> 01:45.239
[rock melody]

01:45.273 --> 01:50.278
* I KNOW WE'LL BE FINE

01:50.311 --> 01:56.917
* WHEN WE LEARN TO LOVE
THE RIDE *

01:56.950 --> 02:01.822
* I KNOW WE'LL BE JUST FINE

02:01.855 --> 02:06.394
* WHEN WE LEARN TO LOVE
THE RIDE *

02:12.566 --> 02:17.205
* GOOD MORNING, MY PRINCE

02:17.238 --> 02:18.939
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING, ALICE?

02:18.972 --> 02:21.675
I'VE BEEN READING A TASTEFUL
GUIDE TO THE FRENCH ARTS.

02:21.709 --> 02:24.845
CHAPTER FIVE SAYS
"WAKE HIM WITH YOUR MOUTH."

02:24.878 --> 02:26.280
THE FRENCH ARTS?

02:26.314 --> 02:30.718
TIPS AND TRICKS
FOR THE MARRIAGE BED.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.686
HOW KINKY.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.522
IF THERE'S ONE THING
I'VE LEARNED

02:34.555 --> 02:36.224
FROM YOUR CHILDREN
OVER THE YEARS,

02:36.257 --> 02:38.292
IT'S THAT WHIPPED TOPPING
MAKES NOT SO YUMMY THINGS

02:38.326 --> 02:39.493
TASTE YUMMIER.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.429
CUT IT OUT, ALICE.

02:41.462 --> 02:44.632
NO SEX.
NOT EVEN A BEEJ.

02:44.665 --> 02:48.336
WELL, FORGIVE ME
FOR BEING A POUTY PATTY.

02:48.369 --> 02:52.506
BUT I FEEL
VERY UNBECOMING RIGHT NOW.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.542
OH, COME ON, ALICE.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.861
WHAT THE DICKENS?

03:35.449 --> 03:41.389
[breathes heavily]

03:46.694 --> 03:49.930
WHY ARE WE EATING CEREAL
ON AN ALICE DAY?

03:49.963 --> 03:52.500
YEAH, SHE WAS GONNA MAKE
MICKEY MOUSE PANCAKES.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.935
HOW COME SHE'S NOT DOWN HERE
INFANTILIZING US LIKE USUAL?

03:54.968 --> 03:56.537
ALICE ISN'T IN
A GREAT MOOD TODAY.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.739
OH, I GET IT.

03:58.772 --> 04:02.410
SHE HAD TO STRAP ON ONE OF THOSE
GIANT MAXI PADS SHE WEARS.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.612
ALICE THINKS TAMPONS
ARE OF THE DEVIL.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.280
SHE CALLS THEM
"SIN MISSILES."

04:06.314 --> 04:07.781
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING TODAY?

04:07.815 --> 04:09.550
I START WORK
AT BARNABEEZ, DAD.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.519
TODAY, I GET TO SHADOW
ONE OF THE REGULAR BITCHES.

04:11.552 --> 04:12.786
AND IF I DO A GOOD JOB,

04:12.820 --> 04:14.655
I GET TO GO ON THE FLOOR
FOR REAL NEXT TIME.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.056
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU GOT A JOB

04:16.089 --> 04:17.791
WITHOUT DOING
AN INTERVIEW.

04:17.825 --> 04:20.528
WHY?
LOOK AT ME.

04:20.561 --> 04:22.663
YEAH, BUT YOU DO REALIZE
YOU NEED TO BE NICE TO PEOPLE

04:22.696 --> 04:24.432
TO BE A WAITRESS?

04:24.465 --> 04:26.367
I JUST THINK YOU'RE JEALOUS
BECAUSE I'M GONNA BE RICH,

04:26.400 --> 04:27.468
AND YOU'RE STILL
GONNA BE WEARING CLOTHES

04:27.501 --> 04:28.569
THAT MAKE YOU SMELL
LIKE MEEMAW.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.037
VINTAGE.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.473
HEY, DAD,
I HAVE AN AUDITION TODAY.

04:32.506 --> 04:33.607
REALLY?

04:33.641 --> 04:35.042
YOU MEAN
YOU'RE GOING TO TRYOUTS?

04:35.075 --> 04:36.577
THIS ISN'T HOLLYWOOD, MARSH.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.579
IT'S A HIGH SCHOOL PRODUCTION
OF GREASE.

04:38.612 --> 04:39.947
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA BE,
A PINK LADY?

04:39.980 --> 04:41.982
I'M GOING FOR KENICKIE.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.952
GOOD LUCK, SON.
MM-HMM.

04:44.985 --> 04:47.821
WHY ARE WE EATING
THESE GHETTO, TORE-UP CHEERIOS?

04:47.855 --> 04:49.623
I MEAN, THEY COME IN A BAG.

04:49.657 --> 04:52.326
(Tara)
BECAUSE THE NON-GHETTO ONES
ARE $1.50 MORE

04:52.360 --> 04:54.995
AND TASTE
EXACTLY THE SAME.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.997
MOM?
ALMOST.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.999
THANK CHRIST.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.602
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?

05:01.635 --> 05:05.005
A TOASTER WAFFLE?
SHOT OF PATRON?

05:05.038 --> 05:06.540
[laughs]

05:06.574 --> 05:07.741
I'M GOOD.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.377
I JUST NEED SOME HELP...

05:09.410 --> 05:13.714
JOINING THE DOTS.

05:15.749 --> 05:18.952
* MY COUNTRY 'TIS TO THE

05:18.986 --> 05:22.456
* SWEET LAND OF LIBERTY

05:22.490 --> 05:24.425
* OF THEE I SING

05:24.458 --> 05:27.094
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE MOUNTING
SUCH A TRITE PRODUCTION.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.762
I WANTED TO DO
NO EXIT.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.932
EVEN SOMETHING MAINSTREAM,
LIKE MILLER,

05:31.965 --> 05:34.935
OR, GOD FORBID, WILDER
WOULD BE PREFERABLE TO THIS.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.137
SEX-CRAZED BOBBY SOXERS?

05:37.170 --> 05:40.107
IT'S NOT EVEN GOOD
ON AN IRONIC LEVEL.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.442
SO WHO DO YOU
WANT TO BE?

05:41.475 --> 05:42.976
SANDY.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.645
(man)
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NEXT.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.815
(girl)
* AND I AM TELLING YOU...

05:47.848 --> 05:50.050
JASON MAURIO'S AUDITIONING?

05:50.083 --> 05:51.685
NO WAY.
I THINK HE'S JUST ON CREW.

05:55.423 --> 05:56.890
I ALWAYS ASSUMED
HE WAS DUMB,

05:56.924 --> 05:59.693
YOU KNOW, BASED
ON THE WHOLE SANTANA FETISH.

05:59.727 --> 06:02.062
BUT HIS TAKE ON RASHOMON
IN FILM CLASS LAST WEEK

06:02.095 --> 06:03.797
WAS PRETTY GOOD.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.165
I BET.

06:05.198 --> 06:08.802
"DUH, IT WAS ALL, LIKE--
LIKE, BACKWARDS AND SHIT?"

06:08.836 --> 06:11.104
I THINK HE'S NICE.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.807
[loud, off-key singing]
* I DON'T WANNA BE FREE

06:13.841 --> 06:16.777
* I'M STAYIN' I'M STAYIN'

06:16.810 --> 06:18.846
* AND YOU AND YOU

06:18.879 --> 06:21.415
HEY.

06:21.449 --> 06:24.485
* YOU'RE GONNA LOVE ME

06:24.518 --> 06:26.587
* OH OOH OOH OOH

06:28.556 --> 06:31.659
WHY IS THERE LIPSTICK
ON THE DESSERT TOPPING?

06:31.692 --> 06:33.026
OH, KATIE WAS HUFFING.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.662
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

06:34.695 --> 06:37.598
THIS IS ALICE'S SHADE, MAX.
FIRE AND ICE.

06:37.631 --> 06:39.032
I'D KNOW IT ANYWHERE.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.569
I'M THE ONE WHO HAS TO SCRUB
THE LIP PRINTS

06:41.602 --> 06:43.003
OFF THE GIN
AND THE COOKING SHERRY,

06:43.036 --> 06:44.738
AND EVERYTHING ELSE
SHE PRETENDS NOT TO DRINK.

06:44.772 --> 06:48.208
ALICE TRIED TO GET
IN MY PANTS THIS MORNING.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.577
[chuckles]

06:49.610 --> 06:52.045
SO SHE'S USING PROPS NOW?

06:52.079 --> 06:54.548
I DIDN'T TAKE THE BAIT,
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW.

06:54.582 --> 06:55.983
HMM, I'M SURPRISED.

06:56.016 --> 06:59.753
DON'T YOU HAVE KIND OF
A MOMMY BONER FOR ALICE?

06:59.787 --> 07:01.822
SERIOUSLY, I DON'T FIND
ALICE ATTRACTIVE.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.558
BUT YOU DO LOOK KIND OF HOT
IN THAT ONE THING SHE WEARS.

07:04.592 --> 07:05.993
WHAT, THAT PSYCHO
PINAFORE THING

07:06.026 --> 07:07.895
THAT MAKES HER LOOK LIKE

07:07.928 --> 07:09.997
THE ROBOT GIRL
FROM SMALL WONDER?

07:10.030 --> 07:11.499
IS THAT
WHAT YOU'RE INTO NOW?

07:11.532 --> 07:12.733
YOU KNOW,

07:12.766 --> 07:15.869
KIND OF CUTE
IN A RETRO WAY.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.138
YOU WANNA FUCK ALICE.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.540
[scoffs]
THAT'S MESSED UP.

07:19.573 --> 07:20.708
WHO WOULD WANT TO FUCK
ALICE?

07:20.741 --> 07:22.476
YOU'D HIT THAT.

07:22.510 --> 07:25.012
I WOULD NOT HIT THAT.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.714
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND...

07:26.747 --> 07:29.983
YEAH?
PROVE IT.

07:30.017 --> 07:32.953
GLADLY.

07:56.744 --> 07:59.913
WHAT'S WRONG?

07:59.947 --> 08:03.617
NOTHING.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.218
I'M JUST--I'M, YOU KNOW--
A LOT ON MY MIND.

08:05.252 --> 08:07.688
I'M TIRED.

08:07.721 --> 08:10.123
OH, OKAY.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.825
NO, HEY.

08:11.859 --> 08:14.795
NO, IT'S OKAY.
YOU HAVE TO GO TO WORK ANYWAY.

08:17.798 --> 08:20.568
I'VE GOTTA GET
TO THERAPY,

08:20.601 --> 08:23.537
AND I'VE GOT THAT DESIGN CONSULT
WITH CHARMAINE'S NEW BOSS.

08:23.571 --> 08:26.707
LET'S--CAN WE
TRY THIS LATER?

08:36.584 --> 08:39.252
HOW'S THE NEW REGIME GOING?
OR LACK OF REGIME?

08:39.286 --> 08:41.689
[laughs]
I SHOULD SAY.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.992
IT'S FINE.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.828
WELL, IT'S CHAOS.

08:47.861 --> 08:51.965
BUT, UM, I STILL FEEL GOOD
ABOUT GOING OFF THE MEDS.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.934
YOU DO?

08:53.967 --> 08:57.237
WELL, IT SEEMED LIKE THERE WAS
NO ALTERNATIVE.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.672
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS ON THE HALCYEM,

08:58.706 --> 09:00.140
I COULDN'T EAT,
I COULDN'T PAINT,

09:00.173 --> 09:06.113
I COULDN'T FUCK.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.015
AND THE KIDS, HOW ARE--
HOW ARE THEY DOING?

09:08.048 --> 09:12.920
THEY'RE GOOD, ACTUALLY.

09:12.953 --> 09:15.255
I THINK THEY'RE
KIND OF RELIEVED.

09:15.288 --> 09:18.058
[sighs]

09:20.628 --> 09:22.696
I'M KINDA WORRIED
ABOUT MAX THOUGH.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.832
YEAH.

09:27.134 --> 09:31.238
THE ALTERS HAVE BEEN,
UH, WELL...

09:31.271 --> 09:33.707
COMING ON TO HIM.

09:33.741 --> 09:36.143
REALLY?

09:36.176 --> 09:38.879
ALICE WANTS ME TO GET
HER PREGNANT AND HAVE A BABY.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.981
ALICE IS THE ONE
THAT'S REALLY OLD SCHOOL?

09:41.014 --> 09:44.084
YEAH.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.987
HEY, HAVE YOU EVER
WANTED TO FUCK THE DUDE?

09:47.020 --> 09:49.256
BUCK?
NO, FUCK YOU.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.991
[laughs]

09:51.024 --> 09:52.693
ALL RIGHT,
WELL, LOOK.

09:52.726 --> 09:55.663
IF ALICE HAS A BABY,
THAT'S A REAL BABY.

09:55.696 --> 09:56.797
LIKE, YOU HAVE
TO TAKE CARE OF IT.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.632
IT'S NOT SOME, LIKE,

09:58.666 --> 10:01.735
IMAGINARY BABY THAT JUST
COMES AND GOES, RIGHT?

10:01.769 --> 10:03.103
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.738
IT'S WEIRD.
I'M NOT DOING IT.

10:04.772 --> 10:07.407
HE MADE OUT WITH T, AND THEN
STOPPED HIMSELF, LUCKILY.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.745
AND THEN ALICE CAME AT HIM
WITH A CAN OF WHIPPED CREAM.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.413
HE SAYS HE RESPECTS
OUR ARRANGEMENT,

10:13.446 --> 10:15.315
AND DIDN'T SLEEP WITH THEM,
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.985
I THINK HE'S TEMPTED.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.920
AND YET, THIS MORNING,
WHEN I INITIATED SEX,

10:19.953 --> 10:21.889
HE COULDN'T GET HARD.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.791
SO AM I ONLY HOT
WHEN I'M A DIFFERENT PERSON?

10:23.824 --> 10:25.893
I MEAN...

10:25.926 --> 10:28.161
HOW INSULTING IS THAT?

10:28.195 --> 10:32.900
WELL, PEOPLE DESIRE
WHAT THEY CAN'T HAVE.

10:32.933 --> 10:36.670
HE CAN HAVE ME.

10:36.704 --> 10:40.107
HE CAN'T HAVE
ALL OF YOU.

10:42.442 --> 10:45.278
THE ALTERS?

10:45.312 --> 10:46.814
[laughs]

10:46.847 --> 10:50.083
THEY'RE NOT ME.

10:50.117 --> 10:52.853
I ENVY YOUR SEX LIFE, DUDE.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.689
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE YOU GOT
ONE OF THOSE

10:55.723 --> 10:56.990
THREE-PACKS OF CEREAL.

10:57.024 --> 10:59.693
YOU GET, LIKE, A FRUIT LOOP,
AND A HONEY SMACK.

10:59.727 --> 11:01.228
YOU JUST DUMP THE MILK
IN THE BOX,

11:01.261 --> 11:02.796
AND THEN CHUCK THE ONES
YOU DON'T LIKE.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.933
YEAH, WELL,
I AIN'T CHUCKIN' ANYONE.

11:05.966 --> 11:08.736
BUT I'M NOT EATING
THAT MUCH CEREAL.

11:08.769 --> 11:12.672
HOW IS THAT
EVEN POSSIBLE?

11:36.864 --> 11:38.766
HI!

13:05.886 --> 13:06.887
TELL ME

13:08.021 --> 13:09.589
YOU KNOW,
I WANT SOMETHING

13:09.622 --> 13:13.093

13:17.397 --> 13:19.366

14:17.057 --> 14:18.425

14:18.458 --> 14:19.559
THIS IS A FAMILY RESTAURANT,

14:19.592 --> 14:23.030

15:38.205 --> 15:40.140
CHARMIE SAYS SHE DIDN'T, BUT...

15:40.173 --> 15:42.542
I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

15:42.575 --> 15:45.545

15:54.387 --> 15:56.990

19:44.617 --> 19:46.219

OUR GREATEST TRIBULATION.

19:46.253 --> 19:48.555
YOUR GREATEST TRIBULATION,
NOT MINE.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.857
YOU HAD NO RIGHT.
IT WAS PRIVATE

19:50.890 --> 19:53.493
MY TEAM LEADER WAS TALKING ABOUT
HIS ASS CANCER, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.894

22:04.491 --> 22:06.626
WOW.

22:06.659 --> 22:07.860
WHEN THEY COME
THROUGH OVERLAND PARK,

22:07.894 --> 22:09.796
THEY WANT TO EAT
AT BARNABEEZ.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.598
REALLY?

22:11.631 --> 22:13.466
LIKE, WHO'S THE MOST FAMOUS
PERSON THAT YOU'VE SEEN?

22:18.571 --> 22:21.508
THERE'S SOMETHING I LIKE
TO SHOW EVERY NEW EMPLOYEE.

22:28.815 --> 22:31.418
WELL, WHAT IS IT?

22:31.451 --> 22:33.653
YOU MIGHT HAVE ALREADY HEARD
THIS ABOUT ME,

22:33.686 --> 22:36.489
BUT I USED TO WORK
AT THE GROUND ZERO BARNABEEZ.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.691
WHAT?

22:38.725 --> 22:40.760
THE LOWER MANHATTAN FRANCHISE.

22:40.793 --> 22:43.663
IT WAS A BLOCK,
MAYBE TWO, THREE BLOCKS

22:43.696 --> 22:46.399
FROM THE WORLD TRADE CENTER.

22:46.433 --> 22:49.636
I WAS THE, UH, ASSISTANT MANAGER

22:52.472 --> 22:55.041
THEN, UH--

22:55.074 --> 22:57.076
THEN SHIT GOT REAL.

22:57.109 --> 23:01.414
WHAT WAS IT LIKE?

23:01.448 --> 23:05.918
IT WAS HORRIFYING.

23:05.952 --> 23:08.688
I WAS IN THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE
WHEN I GOT THE CALL.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.424
I WAS VISITING
A BUDDY OF MINE

23:11.458 --> 23:12.992
FROM RESTAURANT
MANAGEMENT SCHOOL.

23:13.025 --> 23:16.896

23:34.046 --> 23:35.915
I KNOW I MIGHT SEEM
LIKE A REAL TASK MASTER,

23:35.948 --> 23:38.217
BUT THAT'S PART
OF MY CAREER.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.454
I WORK HARD,
AND I PLAY HARD.

23:41.488 --> 23:44.190
NOW, IF YOU EVER
NEED ANYTHING,

23:44.223 --> 23:48.461

24:46.653 --> 24:47.920
HELL HOUSE?

24:47.954 --> 24:50.022
IS THAT THE NAME
OF THE PLAY OR SOMETHING?

24:50.056 --> 24:51.824
OH, MY GOD,
I'VE HEARD OF THESE.

24:51.858 --> 24:53.025
HELL HOUSES.

24:53.059 --> 24:54.594
THEY'RE LIKE HAUNTED HOUSES,

24:54.627 --> 24:56.062
EXCEPT THEY'RE RUN
BY A CHURCH,

24:56.095 --> 24:58.965
AND INSTEAD OF DRACULA,
AND MONSTERS, AND SHIT,

24:58.998 --> 25:02.234
IT'S ALL FREAKY
JESUSY STUFF.

25:02.268 --> 25:04.771
IT'S HOMOPHOBIC
AND ANTI-FEMINIST,

25:04.804 --> 25:06.038
AND IT'S NOT THEATRE.

25:06.072 --> 25:07.974
I--UGH,
I'M OUTTA HERE.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.909
WAIT, COULD WE NOT JUMP

25:17.850 --> 25:20.086
HEY, MAN.

25:20.119 --> 25:22.789
UH, IS THIS
A RELIGIOUS THING?

25:22.822 --> 25:24.957
TECHNICALLY, YES.

25:24.991 --> 25:26.559
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF YOU'RE CHRISTIAN.

25:26.593 --> 25:28.094
IT'S ACTING.

25:28.127 --> 25:29.562
IT'S WAY MORE HARDCORE
THAN ANYTHING

25:29.596 --> 25:30.697
YOU GET TO DO IN SCHOOL.

25:30.730 --> 25:33.099
I GUESS.

25:33.132 --> 25:34.901
HEY, YOU CAN TRUST ME.

25:34.934 --> 25:36.535
ARE YOU COOL
WITH TAKING OFF YOUR SHIRT?

25:38.104 --> 25:41.874
WE NEED AN AIDS PATIENT
BEING FLOGGED IN HELL.

25:43.743 --> 25:46.345
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, BUCK?

25:46.378 --> 25:50.583
UH, I THINK YOUR OLD LADY
GOT A LITTLE GUN SHY.

25:50.617 --> 25:52.819
WHY'S THAT?

25:52.852 --> 25:54.621
NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS
IN THE BEDROOM BEFORE.

25:54.654 --> 25:56.856
THAT'S THE ONE PLACE
WE'RE NOT FUCKED UP.

25:56.889 --> 26:00.960
WELL, TARA THINKS YOU WANT
TO GET BUSY WITH THE ALTERS.

26:00.993 --> 26:03.129
T AND ALICE, I MEAN.
NOT ME.

26:03.162 --> 26:05.865
WE KNOW
YOU AIN'T NO HOMO.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.967
ANYWAY, SHE THINKS
YOU BEEN BANGIN' HER

26:08.000 --> 26:11.203
WHILE SHE WASN'T HER,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

26:11.237 --> 26:13.272

26:13.305 --> 26:16.042
IT'S TOUGH.

26:16.075 --> 26:19.879
BECAUSE I JUST WANT TARA.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.648
I UNDERSTAND
WHY SHE DOESN'T WANT ME

26:21.681 --> 26:22.882
TO SLEEP
WITH THE ALTERS.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.751
SHE'S NOT EVEN CONSCIOUS.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.953
OH, HELL.
IT AIN'T ALL THAT BAD.

26:26.986 --> 26:28.387
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D TAKE FAIR ADVANTAGE

26:28.420 --> 26:30.222
OF THE SITUATION.

26:30.256 --> 26:32.625
OH, REALLY?

26:32.659 --> 26:34.961

26:37.930 --> 26:39.699
MAN, SHE WAS DRUNK AS FUCK,

26:39.732 --> 26:41.300
BUT I DIDN'T
LET THAT STOP ME.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.035
OF COURSE,
I GOT CRABS.

26:43.069 --> 26:45.204
YEAH, I REMEMBER.

26:45.237 --> 26:46.639
WE'RE MEN, YOU KNOW?

26:46.673 --> 26:48.908
WE JUST NEED
TO STICK IT IN SOMEWHERE.

26:48.941 --> 26:52.912
LADIES ARE DIFFERENT.
THEY GOT HIGHS AND LOWS.

26:52.945 --> 26:57.249

27:00.687 --> 27:03.723
