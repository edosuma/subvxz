00:39.540 --> 00:41.211
Bug flew in my mouth.

00:41.211 --> 00:44.715
Oh, man, I am
super excited
about the city.

00:44.715 --> 00:46.627
Livin' in the country
was great and all,

00:46.627 --> 00:48.468
but I was
a big fish
in a little pond.

00:48.468 --> 00:50.170
I'm ready for
a bigger pond.

00:50.170 --> 00:52.222
It'll be great
to see Gramma again.

00:52.222 --> 00:55.135
"It'll be great
to see you, too, Tilly,

00:55.135 --> 00:57.227
and give you
lots of chocolates."

00:57.227 --> 00:59.680
I know things have been tough
since losin' the farm,

00:59.680 --> 01:02.482
but livin' in the city will
be a fresh start for us.

01:02.482 --> 01:05.395
It'll be great.
In fact, it's gotta be great.

01:05.395 --> 01:08.358
If this doesn't work out,
I don't know where we'll end up.

01:08.358 --> 01:09.820
- Papa.
- Thanks, sweetie.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.953
Dad, don't worry about it.

01:12.953 --> 01:14.494
I know a lot
about the city.

01:14.494 --> 01:16.747
In fact, you might
call me an expert.

01:16.747 --> 01:18.749
Cricket Green,
city expert.

01:18.749 --> 01:20.831
But you've never
been to the city.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.162
I flipped through
a book once.

01:22.162 --> 01:23.964
Did I miss our exit?

01:23.964 --> 01:26.166
Kids, help Dad out.
Help Dad out!

01:26.166 --> 01:29.339
Dad, there it is.
Pull over here, Dad.
I'll help.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.801
Cricket, get your
hands off the wheel.

01:30.801 --> 01:32.472
( blows whistle )

01:35.135 --> 01:38.138
Boy, thing sure are
different around here
since I was a boy.

01:38.138 --> 01:41.351
This area used to be
all rollin' farmland.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.313
Yes, sir, this is
the place for me.

01:43.313 --> 01:45.225
BOTH: Wow!

01:47.227 --> 01:49.359
It's more beautiful
than I thought.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.111
Dad, Dad, we gotta
pull over.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.823
There's so much
happenin' around here.

01:52.823 --> 01:54.404
No, Cricket,
I'd rather not.

01:54.404 --> 01:56.156
Drivin' around here
is freakin' me out.

01:56.156 --> 01:58.288
- ( horns honking )
- I'm doin' my best, pal!

01:58.288 --> 02:00.741
Look at that thing.
Oh, missed it.

02:00.741 --> 02:02.793
Oh, that's cool.
Aw, missed it.

02:02.793 --> 02:05.375
Come on, Dad, can't we
get out for just
a little bit?

02:05.375 --> 02:06.546
I can show you two around.

02:06.546 --> 02:08.208
Boy, let me concentrate.

02:08.208 --> 02:10.210
- ( yells )
- ( blowing whistle )

02:13.213 --> 02:15.676
I'll sure feel a lot better
once we get to Gramma's house.

02:15.676 --> 02:17.808
- Huh?
- Hey, Dad.

02:17.808 --> 02:21.221
Cricket, why can't you
be good like your sister? Huh?

02:21.221 --> 02:24.264
- Hi.
- Dad, you've gotta
come check this out.

02:24.264 --> 02:26.316
All right, fine.

02:26.316 --> 02:28.528
"No parking except
on weekdays.

02:28.528 --> 02:32.733
Holidays and Sundays
in between the hours..."

02:32.733 --> 02:34.234
It don't make no sense.

02:34.234 --> 02:36.616
Let's see.
Mm-hm, mm-hmm.
Looks good.

02:36.616 --> 02:38.659
- Come on, Dad,
hurry up.
- Well, okay.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.661
This ain't nothin'
like back home, Dad.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.452
Look around ya.

02:42.452 --> 02:44.665
Welcome to Big City!

02:44.665 --> 02:46.747
- Neato!
- Yay!

02:46.747 --> 02:48.378
Oh, boy.

02:48.378 --> 02:51.461
- Sure is impressive.
- ( car alarm blares )

02:51.461 --> 02:53.674
Well, whoop-whoop
to you, too.

02:53.674 --> 02:56.006
Are these really free?

02:56.006 --> 02:58.468
Yeah, man. I've had,
like, 11 of these today.
Whoo!

02:58.468 --> 03:00.060
Look, Dad,
free sody pops.

03:00.060 --> 03:02.472
Compliments of that
very radical dude.

03:02.472 --> 03:04.474
( yells )

03:04.474 --> 03:06.356
Ooh-whee, Tilly,
over there.

03:06.356 --> 03:09.309
Look, a noble
city bird.

03:09.309 --> 03:11.441
I wonder what
he's thinkin'.

03:11.441 --> 03:14.154
Here, city bird,
have some crumbs.

03:16.486 --> 03:18.618
Huh. Ah!
Move, move, move, move!

03:20.160 --> 03:22.452
I'm not so sure
about this.

03:22.452 --> 03:23.744
Ah, what are
you talkin' about?

03:23.744 --> 03:25.325
It's not so bad.

03:25.325 --> 03:27.167
Why, with an expert
like me by your side,

03:27.167 --> 03:29.039
we'll be able to handle
this city, no problem.

03:31.171 --> 03:34.464
Our truck!
No, no, no, no!

03:34.464 --> 03:37.838
Excuse me, sir.
I think there's
been a little mistake here.

03:37.838 --> 03:39.840
Come back!

03:39.840 --> 03:41.802
- Ho...
- Ly...
- Moley.

03:41.802 --> 03:43.934
My map was in that car.

03:43.934 --> 03:46.146
I don't know how to get to
your gramma's house without it.

03:46.146 --> 03:48.899
What the heck are we
supposed to do now?!

03:48.899 --> 03:50.150
Be calm,
Papa.

03:50.150 --> 03:52.272
Tilly's right.
Be calm, Papa.

03:52.272 --> 03:54.234
This is nothing more
than a minor setback.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.487
Cities are full of
options and possibilities

03:57.487 --> 03:59.739
I'm sure we can find our way
to Gramma's house.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.531
How big can Big City be?

04:04.785 --> 04:07.207
Ew. Just felt a chill
go down my spine.

04:07.207 --> 04:08.959
Come on,
Gramma's house...

04:08.959 --> 04:10.750
- BOTH: Gramma's house,
Gramma's house.
- Oh, boy.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.673
If we can't drive,
we'll just start walkin'.

04:13.673 --> 04:15.505
Easy squeezy.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.087
Whoa, coulda died.

04:17.087 --> 04:18.548
Hey, look,
a little ghost man.

04:18.548 --> 04:20.010
Ghost means go.

04:22.512 --> 04:23.934
Ah... ah.

04:23.934 --> 04:25.345
Ah... ( giggles )

04:25.345 --> 04:27.227
Whee!

04:27.227 --> 04:30.020
Oh, gosh, my personal space.
My personal space!

04:30.020 --> 04:32.352
( all exhale )

04:32.352 --> 04:33.653
- Move it!
- Watch it!

04:33.653 --> 04:35.525
Get outta the road!

04:37.027 --> 04:38.488
Taxi. Taxi!

04:38.488 --> 04:41.611
- Where to?
- Anywhere away from Kyle.

04:41.611 --> 04:43.403
Let's get in
one of those.

04:43.403 --> 04:45.786
Come on, Papa.
Just wave your
hand in the air.

04:45.786 --> 04:49.499
Tilly, you know how
I feel about parading
my finger around in public.

04:49.499 --> 04:52.542
That hay baler took
the best part of me.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.915
I got this, Dad.
The yellow cars are
the hardest to catch.

04:54.915 --> 04:56.546
So leave it to me.

04:56.546 --> 04:59.179
- Taxi!!
-<i> Sacre bleu!</i>

05:00.971 --> 05:02.973
They don't stop
for nothin'.

05:02.973 --> 05:06.636
Hey, guys, I found a feller
who's offerin' us all a ride.

05:06.636 --> 05:08.768
Come on and hop in
my creepy van.

05:08.768 --> 05:10.020
Whoa, whoa, no.

05:10.020 --> 05:12.522
No. Thank you
very much, sir.

05:12.522 --> 05:14.935
Eh, probably a good decision.

05:14.935 --> 05:17.147
What now,
Mr. City Expert?

05:17.147 --> 05:18.859
Well, let's see.
Hmm.

05:18.859 --> 05:22.652
Aha. I know a secret way
people in the city get around.

05:22.652 --> 05:23.994
( growling )

05:23.994 --> 05:26.656
Nope. Never mind.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.350
Cricket, would you
just stop?

05:51.601 --> 05:52.682
Please be water.

05:56.566 --> 05:58.398
CRICKET: That's it.
We'll take

05:58.398 --> 06:00.690
the best form of
public transportation available.

06:00.690 --> 06:01.902
The city bus.

06:03.483 --> 06:06.746
Ah, ridin' to Gramma's
house in comfort and safety.

06:09.659 --> 06:11.952
Oh, no. The bus
is full of weirdos.

06:11.952 --> 06:14.124
We should get
outta here.

06:14.124 --> 06:15.705
No, it's fine.

06:15.705 --> 06:17.497
Oh, hey, that guy
looks friendly.

06:17.497 --> 06:19.499
Just mindin'
his own business.

06:22.262 --> 06:24.384
Rats, rats, he's made
of rats!

06:24.384 --> 06:26.556
( panting )

06:28.348 --> 06:30.060
MAN 1: Are you sure
we're in the clear?

06:30.060 --> 06:31.932
MAN 2: Don't worry. Anyone
sees us, I'll take care of 'em.

06:31.932 --> 06:33.603
( chainsaw buzzes )

06:33.603 --> 06:35.435
Okay, come on,
let's go, go, go, go, go.

06:38.858 --> 06:41.521
Ugh, some fresh start.

06:41.521 --> 06:44.284
First we lost the farm,
then we lost our truck,

06:44.284 --> 06:46.696
huh, and now,
we're lost.

06:46.696 --> 06:49.079
City ain't no place
for us.

06:49.079 --> 06:51.331
We'll just have to
live somewhere else.

06:51.331 --> 06:53.083
( sighs ) Maybe
you're right, Dad.

06:53.083 --> 06:54.955
I was sure I knew
everything about the city,

06:54.955 --> 06:57.497
but it turns out,
I don't know nothin'.

06:57.497 --> 07:00.090
I thought I could
handle a bigger pond.

07:00.090 --> 07:01.841
Well, if we're gonna
live on the streets,

07:01.841 --> 07:03.713
might as well get comfy.

07:03.713 --> 07:07.717
This cardboard box will
make a handsome breakfast nook.

07:07.717 --> 07:10.680
Or maybe a rug.

07:10.680 --> 07:14.224
Oh, look, there's another
poor soul the city's
workin' against.

07:16.516 --> 07:18.818
That's the same towin' company
that took our truck.

07:18.818 --> 07:21.561
Dad, I made a big mistake.

07:21.561 --> 07:23.863
I've been tryin' to
show you how great
the city is,

07:23.863 --> 07:26.446
but I shoulda been
remindin' you how
great we are.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.737
We're tough.

07:27.737 --> 07:29.239
We're resilient.

07:29.239 --> 07:31.241
We're the gol dang
Green family!

07:31.241 --> 07:33.573
Now we've got a chance here
to get our truck back,

07:33.573 --> 07:35.245
and if we can do that,

07:35.245 --> 07:36.997
then we can surely
make it in Big City.

07:36.997 --> 07:39.129
- Come on!
- Wait, Cricket!

07:47.217 --> 07:48.888
Is this legal?

07:48.888 --> 07:50.180
Sh. There it is.

07:51.931 --> 07:54.014
Just as beautiful
as the day we met.

07:54.014 --> 07:56.396
- Come on, let's go.
- Cricket, wait.

07:58.768 --> 08:00.360
It's just like we left it.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.562
Ketchup stains and melted
crayons and everything.

08:02.562 --> 08:05.235
Okay, okay, don't
make so much noise.

08:10.990 --> 08:14.704
Move slowly and quietly.

08:14.704 --> 08:16.286
( barking )

08:16.286 --> 08:17.537
Never mind. Scatter!

08:21.671 --> 08:25.295
( yelling )

08:27.717 --> 08:29.299
Whee!

08:29.299 --> 08:30.800
- ( barking )
- ( yelling resumes )

08:35.805 --> 08:38.598
- Phew!
- ( growling )

08:48.068 --> 08:50.740
I got the keys.
Whoa!

08:53.783 --> 08:55.615
Oh, we shoulda never
come here.

08:55.615 --> 08:57.287
We don't know anything
about the city.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.290
You're wrong, Dad.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.462
There's a lot we may not
know about this city,

09:02.462 --> 09:04.794
but there's a few things
we do.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.626
( alarm blaring )

09:06.626 --> 09:08.628
Have some free sody pop.

09:08.628 --> 09:10.510
Compliments of the house.

09:12.382 --> 09:14.724
Now, Tilly,
release the crumbs.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.730
Now's our chance.

09:25.145 --> 09:27.107
Come on, come on, come on!

09:27.107 --> 09:28.858
( screams )

09:31.401 --> 09:33.863
- Dad, what
are you doin'?
- Go!

09:33.863 --> 09:35.155
Sorry, I just gotta
make this right.

09:35.155 --> 09:38.538
There we go.
Always do
the right thing, kids.

09:38.538 --> 09:41.251
- BOTH: Dad!
- ( whimpers )

09:41.251 --> 09:43.663
Heh. Hay baler. Ha!

09:48.298 --> 09:49.969
( all laughing )

09:52.092 --> 09:54.764
ALL: Wow!

10:00.220 --> 10:03.643
Ya know, we did
pretty well back
there, didn't we?

10:03.643 --> 10:06.276
Yeah, we did.

10:06.276 --> 10:08.898
Gramma's house...

10:08.898 --> 10:10.730
Gramma's house.

10:10.730 --> 10:13.193
ALL: Gramma's house,
Gramma's house,

10:13.193 --> 10:14.784
Gramma's house!

10:14.784 --> 10:17.827
Gramma's house,
Gramma's house!

10:22.702 --> 10:24.794
BOTH: Whoa!

10:24.794 --> 10:27.086
Well, at least
this place
hasn't changed.

10:27.086 --> 10:29.879
( cows mooing )

10:29.879 --> 10:31.421
CRICKET:
It's just like home.

10:31.421 --> 10:33.883
We get to
live here, Papa?

10:33.883 --> 10:35.845
DAD: That's the plan.
What do you think?

10:35.845 --> 10:37.016
It's perfect.

10:37.016 --> 10:38.888
Hey, Ma, we're here.

10:40.019 --> 10:42.061
Ma? Ma!

10:43.313 --> 10:44.684
( all screaming )

10:44.684 --> 10:47.727

20:06.706 --> 20:08.878
You mean
I rounded 'em all up.

20:08.878 --> 20:10.379
-Hmm...
-Hmm...

20:10.379 --> 20:12.501
Nice lasso work, I guess.

20:12.501 --> 20:15.294
I suppose it was strategic
to have a trap there.

20:15.294 --> 20:18.297
You could say
we trapped them all.

20:18.297 --> 20:19.548
Yeah, sure.

20:19.548 --> 20:21.340
Um, I think you both missed one.

20:21.340 --> 20:22.471
[all] Tilly!

20:22.471 --> 20:23.933
Help! My disguise was too good!

20:23.933 --> 20:25.895
He wants to marry me!

20:25.895 --> 20:28.057
He's trying to escape
out the back door!

20:29.648 --> 20:31.440
[Cricket] Quick!
He's heading for that hole!

20:31.440 --> 20:34.063
Dad!
We gotta work together!

20:34.063 --> 20:36.445
You're right.
Let's do this!

20:36.445 --> 20:39.568
[grunts]

20:39.568 --> 20:41.951
Take your time!
Choose your shot!

20:43.362 --> 20:44.363
Aah!

[chuckles]

20:57.466 --> 20:59.258
Well, Dad,
we did it.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.010
We make
a pretty good team, son.

21:01.010 --> 21:03.763
Agreed. Although, I don't know
why we argue so much.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.474
Probably 'cause we both
think we know best.

21:05.474 --> 21:07.516
No, no, that's not it.

21:07.516 --> 21:08.978
It's probably 'cause
we both think we know best.

21:08.978 --> 21:12.772
Hmm... Well, anyway, time to do
what's best for these raccoons.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.564
[chittering]

21:15.564 --> 21:17.736
Back to the wild with ya!

21:17.736 --> 21:19.608
We did a good thing, Dad.

21:19.608 --> 21:22.361
We sure did, son.
We sure did.
