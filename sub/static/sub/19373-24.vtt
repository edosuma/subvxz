01:00.861 --> 01:03.429
Catch me if you can!

01:03.431 --> 01:07.699
Caught ya!
Think you can keep up with this?

01:07.701 --> 01:08.967
Woo-hoo!

01:08.969 --> 01:10.202
Awesome!

01:10.204 --> 01:15.207
Now, watch my trick.
I call it a Rubble Double!

01:15.209 --> 01:17.543
Whoa!

01:18.712 --> 01:19.645
I'm good.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.447
Not bad for a city pup.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.015
(Francois humming)

01:23.017 --> 01:23.749
Hi, Francois.

01:23.751 --> 01:26.351
Are you gonna snowboard with us?

01:26.353 --> 01:27.352
Mais, non.

01:27.354 --> 01:28.854
I am here to photograph

01:28.856 --> 01:32.791
the very shy macaroni penguins.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.093
Cool!

01:34.095 --> 01:35.561
Maybe we could
help you find them.

01:35.563 --> 01:39.064
Oh, no, no, no, no.
It is very complicated.

01:39.066 --> 01:42.201
First, I must track where they
go with this GPS.

01:42.203 --> 01:45.270
Then, I upload it
onto this computer.

01:45.272 --> 01:49.274
Then, I plot it all out on this
map.

01:49.276 --> 01:52.111
Or you could just turn around.

01:52.113 --> 01:53.245
(Chirping)

01:53.247 --> 01:56.115
Hah. I knew that.
(Chirping)

01:56.117 --> 01:59.618

Ugh!

02:11.665 --> 02:15.501
(Dogs howling and barking)

02:15.503 --> 02:19.304
Ryder says hop
on your back feet.

02:20.741 --> 02:24.576
Ryder says turn in a circle.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.945
Wag your tail!

02:26.947 --> 02:30.782
Sorry, Marshall, but I didn't
say "Ryder says."

02:30.784 --> 02:31.650
I know,

02:31.652 --> 02:33.318
but I can't stop
my tail from wagging

02:33.320 --> 02:35.754
when I'm having so much fun.

02:35.756 --> 02:38.657
(All laughing)

Wait!

02:46.033 --> 02:48.700
(Making strange Penguin calls)

02:50.437 --> 02:54.673
Ooh! How do these penguins
run without falling?

02:54.675 --> 02:57.743
A-ha.

02:57.745 --> 03:00.312
Woo-hoo!
BOTH: Yeah!

03:00.314 --> 03:03.148
Whoo! Nice one!

03:03.150 --> 03:04.750
Check this out.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.618
Whoo-hoo! Oh, yeah!

03:06.620 --> 03:10.455
(Barking, howling)
Nailed it!

03:10.457 --> 03:13.292
Rubble, look out behind you!

03:13.294 --> 03:14.493
Oh!

03:14.495 --> 03:16.361
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.430
I didn't look where I was going.

03:18.432 --> 03:21.366
Are you okay, Mr. Peng--
Francois?

03:21.368 --> 03:25.771
Yes, it is. But do not tell the
penguins, hmm?

03:25.773 --> 03:26.738
Take it from me,

03:26.740 --> 03:28.407
if you want to get
close to the penguin,

03:28.409 --> 03:32.311
you must look like the penguin,
you must act like the penguin,

03:32.313 --> 03:37.816
and most important, you must
smell like the penguin.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.919
I call it eau du penguin.

03:43.290 --> 03:46.992
Yuck! Pee-yew!

03:49.129 --> 03:53.532
(Squawking)

03:55.703 --> 03:58.136
FRANCOIS:
Ooh, very nice, penguins.

03:58.138 --> 04:00.205
Work those wings, huh?
Oui, oui.

04:00.207 --> 04:03.141
Come on.
Just a little smile, penguin.

04:03.143 --> 04:05.444
Oui, oui! Beautiful!
(Sniffing)

04:05.446 --> 04:07.379
Ooh, careful, penguin.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.781
Ooh! That tickles!

04:09.783 --> 04:12.150
Whoa! Oh, no! Not my camera!

04:12.152 --> 04:14.686

04:20.661 --> 04:23.228
Is that Francois
I just heard screaming?

04:23.230 --> 04:25.631
Better make sure he's okay.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.966
(Screaming)

04:27.968 --> 04:30.435
(Screaming continuing)

04:30.437 --> 04:33.939
Oh! Are okay, petit penguin?

04:33.941 --> 04:34.973
(Chirping)

04:34.975 --> 04:36.141
Oh, you are a bit nervous?

04:36.143 --> 04:39.611
Well, I have just the thing to
make you feel better--

04:39.613 --> 04:42.247
my cousin's famous squid jerky!

04:42.249 --> 04:44.883
I never leave home without it.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.653
Ah, tres bien.

04:47.655 --> 04:51.590
I think I will call you,
uh, Benoit.

04:51.592 --> 04:52.624
(Squawking)

04:52.626 --> 04:55.294
Then Benoit it is.
Now, Benoit,

04:55.296 --> 04:57.696
you stay here and
I will go find my friends,

04:57.698 --> 05:00.065
who will help us
find your flock. Oui?

05:00.067 --> 05:01.633
(Squawking)

05:01.635 --> 05:06.104
I will use these
to mark my trail.

05:06.106 --> 05:08.307

05:08.309 --> 05:11.209
(Humming continuing)

05:11.211 --> 05:13.345

05:16.083 --> 05:17.482
(Gasping)
Ooh la la!

05:17.484 --> 05:19.751
We are trapped!

05:19.753 --> 05:21.453
Not to worry, Benoit.

05:21.455 --> 05:24.056
I will call the PAW Patrol.

05:24.058 --> 05:29.328
Ryder says flap your ears!
(Laughing)

05:29.330 --> 05:30.762
Laugh!

05:30.764 --> 05:33.265
(Laughing)

05:33.267 --> 05:35.967
Marshall, again?

05:35.969 --> 05:37.135
Ryder didn't say.

05:37.137 --> 05:39.938
It's not my fault
I can't stop having fun.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.908
Oh, boy, there goes my tail
again.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.477

05:45.479 --> 05:46.611

05:46.613 --> 05:48.113
Hello, Francois.
What's up?

05:48.115 --> 05:50.248
<i> Oui, hello, Ryder.</i>
<i> Benoit and I,</i>

05:50.250 --> 05:52.851
<i> we are trapped</i>
<i> by a giant crevasse,</i>

<i> and my petit penguin needs to</i>
<i> get back to his mama and papa.</i>

05:56.757 --> 06:00.459
Okay, Francois, I have your
location and we're on our way.

06:00.461 --> 06:04.096
No crevasse is too big,
no pup is too small.

06:04.098 --> 06:06.064

PAW Patrol,

06:06.066 --> 06:07.899
to the Air Patroller!

06:07.901 --> 06:10.001
ALL:
Ryder needs us!

06:10.003 --> 06:14.039
Ha-ha. Can't fool me.
Ryder didn't say.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.908
RYDER:
<i> Uh, actually, I did say.</i>

06:16.910 --> 06:20.645
Yikes! Hey, tail,
stop wagging.

06:20.647 --> 06:22.614
This is serious.

06:22.616 --> 06:26.151
Watch out!
Whoa-whoa!

06:26.153 --> 06:27.219
(Groaning)

06:27.221 --> 06:29.654
Ryder says wipe out?

(All laughing)

06:33.193 --> 06:35.060
(Barking)

06:35.062 --> 06:38.697
PAW Patrol,
ready for action, Ryder, sir.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.298
Thanks for hurrying, pups.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.134
Francois and his penguin friend

06:42.136 --> 06:44.403
are trapped behind
that big crevasse.

06:44.405 --> 06:45.303
<i>(Yelping)</i>

06:45.305 --> 06:49.541
We need to save them and get
that penguin back to its family.

06:49.543 --> 06:52.778
So, for this mission,
I'll need...

06:52.780 --> 06:54.780
Skye, I'll need you to use your
copter with a basket

06:54.782 --> 06:56.481
to carry the little penguin
across

06:56.483 --> 06:58.717
and quickly deliver him
to his family.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.819
They must be so worried.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.954
This pup's gotta fly!

07:02.956 --> 07:05.957
And I'll also need Everest.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.392
I'll need you to use your cable

07:07.394 --> 07:09.327
to help Francois
across the crevasse.

07:09.329 --> 07:11.930
<i> Ice or snow, I'm ready to go!</i>

07:11.932 --> 07:13.565
Great! We'll meet you there.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.700
I'll send you Francois'
coordinates.

07:15.702 --> 07:20.372
Okay, Robo Dog, pick up Skye's
pup house and let's go!

07:20.374 --> 07:23.041
PAW Patrol is on a roll!

07:29.016 --> 07:30.982
¶ Go, go, go, go, go ¶

07:43.163 --> 07:45.897
Hey, there's Francois.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.966
ROCKY:
And Everest, Rubble
and Jake, too.

07:47.968 --> 07:51.570
Robo Dog, land the Air Patroller
near the crevasse.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.805
Skye, get your copter.

07:53.807 --> 07:57.142
On my way!

Oh, very, very glad to see you.

08:41.288 --> 08:44.155
Skye, lower the basket
for the penguin.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.557
Take him to his family.

08:45.559 --> 08:49.594
SKYE:
One penguin carrier coming down.

08:49.596 --> 08:53.965

It was fun hanging out with you.

08:55.569 --> 08:57.068
(Squawking)

08:57.070 --> 08:58.803
I think he wants
to stay with me.

08:58.805 --> 09:02.908
Everest, launch your grappling
cable across the crevasse.

09:02.910 --> 09:05.544
Francois, can you
tightrope walk across

09:05.546 --> 09:07.679
and carry the penguin with you?

09:07.681 --> 09:10.282
I would not leave Benoit behind.

09:10.284 --> 09:13.051
(Barking)
Grappling hook.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.657

Whoa!

09:29.136 --> 09:33.071
Steady! Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:33.073 --> 09:35.874
Benoit!

09:36.843 --> 09:39.511
Oh, no, no, no, no!
What have I done?!

09:39.513 --> 09:41.112
Francois, it'll be okay.

09:41.114 --> 09:45.917
Let's get you safely across
and then we'll rescue Benoit.

09:47.654 --> 09:49.254
Gotcha.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.056
But what about
the petit penguin?

09:51.058 --> 09:54.526
Rubble, I need you to suit up
and get your hover board

09:54.528 --> 09:56.595
and shovel to dig out Benoit.

09:56.597 --> 10:01.266
Rubble on the double!

10:04.137 --> 10:07.505

Shovel!

10:09.576 --> 10:11.610

10:11.612 --> 10:13.945
Rubble, wait! That snow could
cave in any second!

10:13.947 --> 10:17.015
Benoit should stay clear.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.783
But how will we warn him?

10:18.785 --> 10:21.353
Um, allow me.
(Clearing throat)

10:21.355 --> 10:24.155
(Making penguin noises)

10:24.157 --> 10:24.990
(Squawking)

10:24.992 --> 10:28.727
Hmm. I happen to speak
a little Penguinese.

10:28.729 --> 10:31.029
It is okay to dig.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.901
Hey, Benoit.
Come on out.

10:36.903 --> 10:39.738

Nice job, Rubble.

10:45.245 --> 10:48.880
Okay, cutie,
are you ready this time?

10:51.518 --> 10:55.754
It's okay.
Skye's the best flyer ever.

Thank you, Ryder, for coming all
this way to rescue us.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.064
You're welcome.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.832
Whenever you have

... for help.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.719
I must get this photo.

11:27.721 --> 11:29.921
Everybody say...
(Making penguin noises)

11:29.923 --> 11:31.723
(Squawking)

11:31.725 --> 11:33.925
Wait, wait. I said "braaah,"
not-- oh!

11:33.927 --> 11:36.828
Stop that. What are you doing?

11:36.830 --> 11:38.730
Whoa!

11:38.732 --> 11:41.099
Huh. Maybe they really
don't understand

11:41.101 --> 11:42.834
what Francois is saying.

11:42.836 --> 11:47.038
Or maybe he's just a way
excellent snowboard.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.841
¶ P-P-PAW, PAW,
PAW, PAW Patrol ¶

11:55.449 --> 11:56.781
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:56.783 --> 12:01.252
the amazing Pup Circus pyramid!

12:01.254 --> 12:02.454
Hey.

12:02.456 --> 12:04.155
Maybe Raymundo
will let us do our

12:04.157 --> 12:06.491
pyramid pup trick in the show.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.760
(Howling)

12:08.762 --> 12:10.662
ALL:
Whoa!

12:10.664 --> 12:15.433
Or maybe Raymundo
could use an extra clown-- me!

12:15.435 --> 12:16.501
(All laughing)

12:16.503 --> 12:20.805
I can't wait for Raymundo to get
here with his hippo show.

12:20.807 --> 12:24.676
Me too! His hippos are so cute!

12:24.678 --> 12:28.046
Look at me! I'm a hippo!
(Barking)

12:28.048 --> 12:32.350
Um, actually, Rubble, I think
hippos sound more like this.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.685
(Snorting)

12:33.687 --> 12:36.187
Oh, yeah! They do!
Thanks, Chase.

12:36.189 --> 12:40.391
And those hippos do
fun tricks, like this!

12:40.393 --> 12:42.427
Whoa!
(All laughing)

12:42.429 --> 12:44.629
Woo-hoo!
Yeah!

12:44.631 --> 12:48.800
Hey, Ryder. You and your pups
sure have a lot of fun.

12:48.802 --> 12:52.036
Yeah. They make me
laugh all the time.

12:52.038 --> 12:56.808
Cool! Maybe one day,
I'll get an animal buddy.

12:56.810 --> 12:57.842
That's a great idea.

12:57.844 --> 13:00.512
But right now, I've got
skateboards to test

13:00.514 --> 13:02.347
for my most extreme
stunt ever.

13:02.349 --> 13:05.116
Sounds daring, Danny.
What stunt will you do?

13:05.118 --> 13:08.119
I don't know yet.
And it's Daring Danny X.

13:08.121 --> 13:12.290
But I need an extra skateboard,
so can I borrow yours, Ryder?

13:12.292 --> 13:13.191
Sure.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.360
Help yourself, Daring Danny X.

13:15.362 --> 13:17.428
Bye! Good luck.

13:17.430 --> 13:20.398
Bye.
ALL: Bye!

13:20.967 --> 13:26.805
Hope you hippos are happy 'cause
we're almost to Adventure Bay.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.673
(Grunting)

13:29.609 --> 13:32.010
Whoa! Hold on, hippos.

13:33.547 --> 13:34.946
It looks like I have a flat.

13:34.948 --> 13:37.048
I must change this tire.

13:37.050 --> 13:42.020
So, you heavy hippos
need to hop out, please.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.889
(Grunting)

13:44.891 --> 13:47.158
Hi, Raymundo.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.560
Hi, Rocky.
What are you doing here?

13:48.562 --> 13:51.229
I'm on my way back from
the recycling center,

13:51.231 --> 13:52.897
when I saw you were stuck.

13:52.899 --> 13:55.133
It looks like you could
use some help.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.034
Absolutely.

13:56.036 --> 14:00.305
Any chance you have a tire jack
Raymundo could borrow?

14:00.307 --> 14:02.173
No. But...

14:02.175 --> 14:04.309
(Truck beeping)

14:04.311 --> 14:07.745
... I can raise it
with my forklift.

14:07.747 --> 14:09.080
Bravisimo.

14:09.082 --> 14:11.649
And I can help you
with this tire.

14:11.651 --> 14:14.085
(Barking)
Ratchet.

14:17.591 --> 14:18.590
Oh, while we're waiting,

14:18.592 --> 14:21.359
let's practice the new trick
Raymundo taught you.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.094
Hippo volleyball!

14:23.096 --> 14:24.729
(Grunting)

14:24.731 --> 14:28.933
Good job.
Let me help you with that.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.839
(Grunting)

14:34.841 --> 14:36.808
Great work, Rocky.

14:36.810 --> 14:38.643
Back in the truck, hippos!

14:38.645 --> 14:41.246
Our show's supposed
to start soon!

14:41.248 --> 14:42.413
I'd better hurry, too.

14:42.415 --> 14:45.350
I want to see your show
with the rest of the pups.

14:45.352 --> 14:47.285
Bye!

14:47.287 --> 14:49.554
Presto pronto, hippos.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.523
(Grunting)

14:52.525 --> 14:53.691
I hear you, Mama Daisy.

14:53.693 --> 14:59.564
Raymundo will get us all to the
big top as soon as he can.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.966
(Grunting)

15:03.203 --> 15:06.671
Okay, what kind of stunt
should I do?

15:06.673 --> 15:09.641
It's gotta be something
different.

15:10.310 --> 15:14.112
With a ball? Maybe.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.179
(Snorting)

15:15.181 --> 15:19.083
And a hippo?
Now that's different!

15:19.085 --> 15:20.184
(Snorting)

15:20.186 --> 15:22.353
There you go, buddy.

15:22.856 --> 15:25.623
(Gasping)
Whoa!

15:27.193 --> 15:30.862
You're really good!

15:30.864 --> 15:32.897
Amazing!

15:32.899 --> 15:34.599
Wow!

15:34.601 --> 15:38.903
You're not just a hippo,
you're a hippo X!

15:38.905 --> 15:40.605
Aw...

15:40.607 --> 15:43.508
Hey, wanna be my animal buddy?

15:43.510 --> 15:45.476
(Grunting)

15:46.379 --> 15:50.315
Awesome! I have
my own animal buddy!

15:50.317 --> 15:53.017
And I'm gonna name you Hero!

15:53.019 --> 15:57.021
I wonder what else you can do.

15:57.791 --> 16:01.559
Interesting.
Okay!

16:02.429 --> 16:05.697
Woo-hoo! Hippo surfing!

16:05.699 --> 16:07.799
I mean, hippo riding!

16:07.801 --> 16:10.535
No, I got it-- hippo boarding.

16:10.537 --> 16:14.605
Now that's a stunt
nobody's ever done.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.510
(Grunting)

16:19.512 --> 16:22.580
Don't worry, Daisy.
We're almost there.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.615
(Gasping)

16:25.819 --> 16:28.119
Daisy? One baby hippo.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.821
(Gasping)
No baby hippo!

16:29.823 --> 16:32.156
Oh, no! How could
I lose a whole hippo?

16:32.158 --> 16:35.026
I better call the PAW Patrol.

16:35.028 --> 16:35.893
(Laughing)

16:35.895 --> 16:37.996
<i> (Communicator ringing)</i>
Hey, Raymundo.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.998
We were just getting
ready to go to your circus.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.335
<i> There will be no circus unless</i>
<i> I can find my baby hippo.</i>

16:44.337 --> 16:45.570
<i> He's lost!</i>

16:45.572 --> 16:46.838
<i> (Grunting)</i>

16:46.840 --> 16:48.139
<i> Sorry, Mama.</i>
<i> She's lost.</i>

16:48.141 --> 16:51.342
<i>She must have wandered off when</i>
<i> we changed my tire.</i>

16:51.344 --> 16:53.678
Don't worry, Raymundo.
We'll find her.

16:53.680 --> 16:57.348
No hippo's too big,
no pup is too small.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.983
<i> (Beeping)</i>

16:58.985 --> 17:01.853
PAW Patrol, to the Lookout!

17:01.855 --> 17:04.122
ALL:
Ryder needs us!

17:05.425 --> 17:06.691
Whoa!

17:06.693 --> 17:09.093
Cool.

17:09.963 --> 17:12.196
Look out!
Careful.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.132
Whoa!
ALL: Marshall!

17:14.134 --> 17:19.337
Aww, I "hoop" you don't think
I'm just clowning around.

17:19.339 --> 17:22.273
(All laughing)

17:29.382 --> 17:32.517
(Elevator bell dinging)

17:34.954 --> 17:38.656
PAW Patrol, ready for action,
Ryder, sir.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.659
Thanks, 'cause we've
got a circus to save.

17:41.661 --> 17:44.295
When Raymundo had
to change his tire,

17:44.297 --> 17:46.431
a baby hippo disappeared...
<i>Oh, no.</i>

17:46.433 --> 17:47.965
...and we're gonna find her.

17:47.967 --> 17:50.301
So, for this mission,
I'll need...

17:50.303 --> 17:51.569
Skye.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.904
I need you to fly your copter

17:52.906 --> 17:54.439
to see if you can
spot the lost hippo.

17:54.441 --> 17:57.842
(Barking)
Let's take to the sky!

17:57.844 --> 17:59.143
Chase.

17:59.145 --> 18:00.344
I need you to use your megaphone

18:00.346 --> 18:01.813
to get the hippo's
attention with...

18:01.815 --> 18:04.615
(Grunting)
...hippo sounds!

18:04.617 --> 18:06.551
You're really good at those.

18:06.553 --> 18:09.854
Chase is on the case!
(Snorting)

18:09.856 --> 18:10.688
And Rocky.

18:10.690 --> 18:14.325
I need you to show us where you
helped Raymundo change his tire.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.928
The baby hippo might be nearby.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.930
Green means go!

18:18.932 --> 18:22.033
All right!
PAW Patrol is on a roll!

19:10.550 --> 19:15.887
(Siren wailing)

19:22.195 --> 19:26.063
Woo-hoo! I can't wait to show
everyone this footage

19:26.065 --> 19:27.732
of my awesome, daring stunts!

19:27.734 --> 19:30.101
Whoops!

19:30.103 --> 19:33.437
(Grunting)
Hey!

19:33.439 --> 19:35.773
Easy, Hero!

19:37.644 --> 19:39.877
(Siren sounding)

19:39.879 --> 19:44.081
Hmm. Raymundo's truck
broke down right here.

19:44.083 --> 19:45.850
Then she's probably nearby.

19:45.852 --> 19:49.487
Chase, use your megaphone
to call that hippo.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.622
(Barking)
Megaphone.

19:51.624 --> 19:54.325
<i> (Snorting)</i>

19:54.327 --> 19:55.726
Look!

19:55.728 --> 19:57.295
Maybe that's the baby hippo.

19:57.297 --> 19:58.829
ALL:
Huh?

19:58.831 --> 20:01.666
(Honking)
SKYE:
<i> Ryder, come in.</i>

20:01.668 --> 20:05.536
I see them, but you're
not gonna believe this.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.238
RYDER:
<i> Them?</i>

20:07.240 --> 20:09.473
Yeah, the baby hippo
and Daring Danny.

20:09.475 --> 20:12.443
They're skateboarding
down a drainage ditch,

20:12.445 --> 20:14.979
heading towards
Katie's Pet Parlor.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.515
Thanks. We'll head them off.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.050
Come on!

20:19.052 --> 20:23.487
Rubble, we need you to build a
barrier in the drainage ditch

20:23.489 --> 20:24.555
by Katie's shop.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.291
Use your rig to build one
with hay bales.

20:27.293 --> 20:30.494
<i> Rubble on the double!</i>

20:33.466 --> 20:34.599
This is way extreme!

20:34.601 --> 20:39.937
It'll look great if I can
just figure out how to--

20:40.807 --> 20:43.641
Stop!
Uh-oh!

20:44.110 --> 20:47.979
That should stop
a runaway hippo.

20:50.283 --> 20:55.419
No, Hero, please,
forget the ball! Whoa!

20:55.421 --> 20:57.922
Awesome kick flip, though, Hero.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.624
(Screaming)

20:59.626 --> 21:02.026
Looks like the circus
must be in town.

21:02.028 --> 21:05.596
Hey, I need those boards.

21:06.766 --> 21:10.935
Epic landing and one close call.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.336
(Grunting)

21:12.338 --> 21:13.437
It'll be okay, Hero,

21:13.439 --> 21:17.275
as long as we get down
before the roof caves in.

21:17.277 --> 21:20.177
Help!
(Grunting)

21:20.179 --> 21:21.712
(Siren wailing)

21:21.714 --> 21:23.214
We just heard
the weirdest sound.

21:23.216 --> 21:27.151
Probably because you have a
hippo on your roof.

21:27.153 --> 21:28.552
Whoa!

21:28.554 --> 21:29.854
What?!

21:29.856 --> 21:30.988
Help!

21:30.990 --> 21:33.157
Don't worry. We'll get you down.

21:33.159 --> 21:35.426
Maybe I can try
to airlift them off.

21:35.428 --> 21:38.462
Sorry, that hippo's
just too heavy.

21:38.464 --> 21:42.033
Rocky, think you can rig up
some kind of hippo ramp?

21:42.035 --> 21:43.000
You bet I can.

21:43.002 --> 21:46.370
I can find lots
of things to reuse.

21:48.074 --> 21:50.941
All done.

21:50.943 --> 21:54.612
Okay, Danny, try to get
that hippo to skateboard

21:54.614 --> 21:55.579
down this ramp.

21:55.581 --> 21:59.016
Hero, think you can
roll down that ramp?

21:59.018 --> 22:00.518
(Grunting)

22:00.520 --> 22:04.322
Please? You can do it.
I know you can.

22:04.324 --> 22:05.956
(Horn honking)

22:05.958 --> 22:09.293
There's your baby, Mama Daisy.

22:09.295 --> 22:12.330
(Grunting)

22:12.332 --> 22:15.366
Whoa! Woo-hoo!

22:17.303 --> 22:18.235
(Grunting)

22:18.237 --> 22:20.905
Wow! That was spectacular.

22:20.907 --> 22:23.274
Thanks for the call, Ryder.

22:23.276 --> 22:25.409
Oh, well.
We were a super extreme

22:25.411 --> 22:27.178
daring duo for a little while.

22:27.180 --> 22:32.416
I say your super duo
deserves an encore!

22:32.952 --> 22:35.653
(Crowd cheering)
(Pups chattering)

22:35.655 --> 22:38.255
CHASE:
Go, Danny!

22:38.257 --> 22:39.190
Great job, dude.

22:39.192 --> 22:42.793
Thanks for saving the show,
PAW Patrol.
