WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:03.271
Previously on CSI: Cyber...

00:03.304 --> 00:04.438
I am trying to
look professional

00:04.472 --> 00:07.341
before I go in front of the
judge for my 5K1 hearing.

00:07.375 --> 00:09.543
You given any thought
to what you want to do after?

00:09.577 --> 00:10.744
You don't trust me.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.313
I just don't trust
your judgment.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.447
It's like a parole island here.

00:13.481 --> 00:15.249
NELSON: It's like,
no matter what I do right,

00:15.283 --> 00:16.550
I can't shake what I did wrong.

00:16.584 --> 00:18.452
Eight million.
I won't tell anybody. Come on.

00:18.486 --> 00:20.054
You know where it is.
I didn't steal it.

00:20.088 --> 00:21.422
I'm gonna find
out who did.

00:21.455 --> 00:23.757
And when I do, I'm gonna put
that bastard in prison.

00:23.791 --> 00:25.693
Come on. There's a spring
in your step,

00:25.726 --> 00:27.361
you got a grin
a mile wide.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.363
You, sir, are smitten.
Who is she?

00:29.397 --> 00:30.364
Greer Latimore.

00:30.398 --> 00:31.699
RUSSELL:
I'm really feeling it.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.301
She's a former
Secret Service agent.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.603
Dabble in
private investigations.

00:35.636 --> 00:36.737
Oh, boy.

00:40.174 --> 00:42.176
*

00:45.413 --> 00:47.648
* ... love, give me diamonds

00:47.681 --> 00:49.683
* ... love,
give me diamonds *

00:49.717 --> 00:51.752
* ... love, give me diamonds

00:51.785 --> 00:54.388
* ... love,
give me diamonds *

00:54.422 --> 00:56.657
* I'm already in love
with myself *

00:56.690 --> 00:58.526
* So in love with myself

00:58.559 --> 01:00.561
* I'm already in love
with myself *

01:00.594 --> 01:03.063
* ... love, give me diamonds

01:08.202 --> 01:11.439
* Oh, no, that love ...,
I won't do it *

01:11.472 --> 01:14.442
* Love, love, love,
love, love... *

01:14.475 --> 01:16.177
(car door closes)

01:16.210 --> 01:17.211
Ready?

01:26.654 --> 01:29.857
Please don't. I'm begging you.
Please don't...

01:29.890 --> 01:32.193
WOMAN (echoing):
You shot him!

01:32.226 --> 01:33.727
(panting)

01:37.198 --> 01:40.268
(train horn blows in distance)

01:40.301 --> 01:41.735
(panting)

01:49.610 --> 01:51.812
You're late.
I'm sorry about that.

01:51.845 --> 01:54.215
You sure you're willing to risk
going to jail for this?

01:54.248 --> 01:55.749
That's my problem, not yours.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.823
It's all there.

02:04.192 --> 02:06.660
Make sure nobody knows
you got this from me.

02:06.694 --> 02:09.330
(sighs)
(phone buzzes)

02:15.836 --> 02:17.505
(siren wailing in distance)

02:17.538 --> 02:18.806
(horns honking)

02:18.839 --> 02:20.641
RAMIREZ:
Where the hell
have you been?

02:20.674 --> 02:22.810
Avery called the team together
three hours ago.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.812
Okay. So where's everyone else?
On their way to
Los Angeles.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.914
And we're working from here.
The app Freelane

02:26.947 --> 02:29.950
has been hacked.
Look at this.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.753
Instead of directing L.A.
users to their destination,

02:32.786 --> 02:33.921
it's sending them
to remote locations.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.856
*

02:39.893 --> 02:41.795
A week ago, my I.T.
department flagged

02:41.829 --> 02:44.198
a number of intrusions
into the network.

02:44.232 --> 02:46.600
The hacker's knowledge of
the system led us to believe

02:46.634 --> 02:48.602
that it could be one
of my employees.

02:48.636 --> 02:51.672
Which is why they called
my private investigation firm.

02:51.705 --> 02:52.940
So rather than reach out
to authorities,

02:52.973 --> 02:54.208
they decided to keep
this investigation internal.

02:54.242 --> 02:56.710
Exactly. It's in
the best interest

02:56.744 --> 02:59.513
of the company to
avoid unnecessary panic.

02:59.547 --> 03:02.783
Any loss of confidence, the
price of your stock plunges.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.518
Based on the fact that you
called in the Cyber Division,

03:04.552 --> 03:06.754
can we assume that
you've ruled out an inside job?

03:06.787 --> 03:08.756
Yes. It appeared to be
an outside intrusion

03:08.789 --> 03:10.758
that forced the algorithm
that calculates

03:10.791 --> 03:12.860
the most efficient
route to malfunction.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.228
But why hack Freelane?

03:14.262 --> 03:16.564
MAN: Someone wanted
to reroute drivers.

03:16.597 --> 03:17.498
Five of our users,

03:17.531 --> 03:19.333
all in L.A.,
were led to

03:19.367 --> 03:20.234
remote locations.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.504
FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Approaching destination.

03:25.639 --> 03:28.709
You've arrived
at your destination.

03:28.742 --> 03:31.412
LAPD reported
that each driver was robbed

03:31.445 --> 03:34.448
at gunpoint by three young
women wearing masks.

03:34.482 --> 03:36.417
I found a connection
between the Freelane app

03:36.450 --> 03:37.585
and the robberies.

03:37.618 --> 03:40.721
They targeted Freelane users
'cause they blindly follow

03:40.754 --> 03:42.456
the app's navigation.

03:42.490 --> 03:44.625
Most users don't even question
the app when it reroutes 'em.

03:44.658 --> 03:45.626
They just go where it leads.

03:45.659 --> 03:46.627
This is why I'll never give up

03:46.660 --> 03:47.628
my Thomas Guide.

03:47.661 --> 03:50.864
You can't hack
a spiral-bound stack of papers.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.266
Freelane I.T.
just found

03:52.300 --> 03:54.268
another intrusion
into the network,

03:54.302 --> 03:57.805
but LAPD has no recent reports
of similar robberies.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.440
KRUMITZ:
Well, let's plug in,

03:59.473 --> 04:00.741
source the intrusions.
Let's do it.

04:01.809 --> 04:04.845
Dude, who's
that stone-cold hottie

04:04.878 --> 04:07.515
private investigator?
Greer.

04:07.548 --> 04:08.482
What?!

04:08.516 --> 04:09.783
That's Greer?

04:09.817 --> 04:11.685
D.B.'s Gree...

04:11.719 --> 04:13.587
Wow!
Diebenkorn for the win.

04:13.621 --> 04:14.588
RYAN:
Mr. Jennings,

04:14.622 --> 04:15.723
I recommend that you use

04:15.756 --> 04:17.691
your app's direct messaging
feature to let

04:17.725 --> 04:19.460
your users know
that they should avoid

04:19.493 --> 04:20.894
any unfamiliar
routes.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.364
No, I can't do that.

04:23.397 --> 04:25.032
You can't or you won't?

04:25.065 --> 04:26.800
The benefit of Freelane
is that it recommends

04:26.834 --> 04:29.870
unfamiliar routes because
they're the least traveled

04:29.903 --> 04:31.339
and often the fastest.

04:31.372 --> 04:33.941
But we wouldn't know that
without our users.

04:33.974 --> 04:36.009
You need the users in order
for your app to work.

04:36.043 --> 04:38.612
Yes. It's crowd-sourced
navigation.

04:38.646 --> 04:41.549
Users provide real-time updates
of traffic accidents,

04:41.582 --> 04:43.384
lane closures,
stalled vehicles.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.385
FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Caution!

04:44.418 --> 04:46.787
Vehicle on the shoulder ahead.

04:46.820 --> 04:47.988
Has the vehicle moved?

04:49.156 --> 04:52.025
And then the user responses
help our algorithm narrow down

04:52.059 --> 04:54.395
the options
for the fastest route.

04:54.428 --> 04:55.796
Mr. Jennings,
we recognize the value

04:55.829 --> 04:58.466
of your app,
but you have a responsibility

04:58.499 --> 05:00.768
to let your users know
there is a risk.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.903
Avery, we just sourced all
the intrusions onto the network.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.572
Unfortunately,
they all lead back

05:04.605 --> 05:06.840
to the same IP address in Syria.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.909
Obviously a proxy.
And most likely
using a command

05:08.942 --> 05:11.379
and control server
to anonymize their IP address.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.080
This is a dead end.
KRUMITZ:
Guys, I just got

05:13.113 --> 05:14.915
an I.D. on the latest
user to get rerouted.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.384
It's Joel Matthews.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.851
His cell phone
stopped moving

05:17.885 --> 05:19.019
right in the middle
of his route.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.020
Been there for hours.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.489
Could be an active
crime scene.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.491
(siren wailing, tires screech)

05:27.595 --> 05:28.996
(tires screech, siren stops)

05:30.864 --> 05:32.733
All right, we got a body!
(over radio): Charlie 2-3.
I'm en route.

05:32.766 --> 05:33.967
OFFICER:
Come with me!

05:34.001 --> 05:35.736
Keep your eye on the rooftops.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.839
(crossing signal bells dinging)
(siren approaching)

05:38.872 --> 05:40.674
MUNDO: Two victims.
One male, one female.

05:41.809 --> 05:42.776
RUSSELL: This guy
was shot at close range.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.878
MUNDO: He's dead.

05:44.912 --> 05:45.879
KRUMITZ: There's a mask.

05:45.913 --> 05:46.647
More than likely
belongs to one of our suspects.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.849
RYAN:
I got a pulse! She's alive!

05:48.882 --> 05:50.584
Get the EMTs!

05:50.618 --> 05:51.852
OFFICER: Nobody around, right?
FEMALE OFFICER: Nothing, Jack.

05:51.885 --> 05:54.688
MUNDO:
Requesting an EMT at the corner
of Mateo and Sixth.

06:01.995 --> 06:07.935
* I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise *

06:10.037 --> 06:16.410
* I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes *

06:16.444 --> 06:19.747
* I can see
for miles and miles *

06:19.780 --> 06:23.784
* I can see for miles
and miles *

06:23.817 --> 06:27.855
* I can see
for miles and miles *

06:27.888 --> 06:31.625
* And miles...

06:31.659 --> 06:32.660
* Oh, yeah.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.671
Hey, y'all, Flash Squad here.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.473
Kisses.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.641
I know you've been waiting
for our latest video.

06:47.675 --> 06:50.744
Wanted to show you some of
the hot items we just picked up.

06:50.778 --> 06:53.847
I know you're thinking
you need cold, hard cash

06:53.881 --> 06:56.016
to get your hands
on this high-end fashion.

06:56.049 --> 06:58.952
But, really,
all you need is this.

06:58.986 --> 07:01.121
KRUMITZ: This is one of the
videos the group posted.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.090
They call themselves
the Flash Squad.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.224
I remember the good old days,

07:04.257 --> 07:06.560
when criminals would just stash
their loot and lay low.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.729
Now they make videos
bragging about it,

07:08.762 --> 07:10.731
and social media turns 'em
into online celebrities

07:10.764 --> 07:12.099
with thousands
of followers.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.668
RYAN: Keeping up with
the Kardashians is expensive.

07:14.702 --> 07:16.837
They just turned
to crime to do it.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.872
Where'd you get this video?
I sent Raven

07:18.906 --> 07:20.674
a picture of the mirrored mask
we recovered here

07:20.708 --> 07:21.842
at the crime scene.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.777
She used an image search.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.520
According to the police report,
those luxury items the girls

07:32.553 --> 07:34.955
were flaunting were reported
stolen two weeks ago.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.890
So that confirms that the
Flash Squad is responsible

07:36.924 --> 07:38.559
for the theft.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.861
The question is:
are they hackers?

07:40.894 --> 07:42.195
And Nelson sourced this video.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.064
It was posted
from the same Syrian IP

07:44.097 --> 07:45.866
that originated
the Freelane hack.

07:45.899 --> 07:48.035
Looks like what started
as armed robbery

07:48.068 --> 07:50.571
just escalated to murder.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.139
(overlapping, indistinct
conversation and radio chatter)

07:52.172 --> 07:53.941
Well, this turned out great.

07:53.974 --> 07:57.144
Never imagined our paths
crossing professionally.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.012
I know. I was
surprised by your call.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.814
L.A.'s a long way from DC.

08:00.848 --> 08:03.684
You take a lot of West
Coast investigations?

08:03.717 --> 08:06.620
I oversee all
of our firm's L.A. clients.

08:06.654 --> 08:09.790
I grew up here.
Didn't get home much

08:09.823 --> 08:11.625
during my time
with the Secret Service.

08:11.659 --> 08:14.628
This gives me a chance
to see my family.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.964
I'm dating a... Valley Girl?

08:16.997 --> 08:19.600
(imitating Valley accent):
Oh, my God. No.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.001
You're dating
a Dena girl.

08:21.034 --> 08:21.869
Pasadena.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.671
MUNDO: No wallet or I.D.
on the male vic.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.873
Probably stolen.
Vehicle registration confirms

08:25.906 --> 08:27.174
it's Joel Matthews.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.642
34 years old.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.611
Senior Executive at Palo Vista
Children's Hospital,

08:30.644 --> 08:31.579
in Orange County.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.881
No luck I.D.'ing
his female companion?
No.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.649
No sign of a wallet
or purse or cell.

08:35.683 --> 08:36.884
Flash Squad
must've stolen those as well.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.553
The robbery fits
the Flash Squad's M.O.

08:39.587 --> 08:42.255
but murder,
I'm not so sure about that.
The female victim

08:42.289 --> 08:43.390
is still in surgery.
If she pulls through,

08:43.423 --> 08:45.659
she may be able to I.D.
at least one of her attackers.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.795
You see that?

08:47.828 --> 08:50.097
Looks like the victim's car
was rear-ended.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.031
LATIMORE: Fits with

08:51.064 --> 08:52.099
the previous reported thefts.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.334
All of the victims were involved
in a fender bender

08:54.367 --> 08:55.569
before they were robbed.

08:55.603 --> 08:57.037
RUSSELL:
Based on the location

08:57.070 --> 08:58.572
of the paint transfer,
I'm guessing the killer

08:58.606 --> 08:59.907
was driving a black SUV.

08:59.940 --> 09:00.574
I'll have the locals

09:00.608 --> 09:03.343
put out an APB. Although...

09:03.376 --> 09:05.846
a black SUV with a young female
behind the wheel

09:05.879 --> 09:07.247
isn't exactly gonna stand out

09:07.280 --> 09:08.716
in Los Angeles.

09:12.686 --> 09:15.222
Elijah, what are
you thinking?

09:15.255 --> 09:16.990
What do you make of that?

09:17.958 --> 09:19.727
Not a train in sight.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.095
So why is the crossing arm
still down?

09:22.129 --> 09:25.733
That's a very good question.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.208
I've got a malicious code
that allowed our black hat

09:35.242 --> 09:37.645
to reroute Joel Matthews
to the train tracks.

09:37.678 --> 09:41.014
Whoa! Whoa, look at this.

09:41.048 --> 09:42.783
Nelson.
Yeah.

09:42.816 --> 09:43.917
Hmm?
What's up?

09:43.951 --> 09:45.152
Uh, nothing.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.987
RAMIREZ: Our hacker used
the Freelane intrusion

09:47.020 --> 09:49.657
to gain access
to Joel Matthews' entire phone.

09:49.690 --> 09:50.991
There's digital dust
in his credit card app,

09:51.024 --> 09:52.660
GPS, and his e-mail.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.394
The moment Joel
logged into Freelane,

09:54.427 --> 09:57.698
hackers were controlling
his device.

09:57.731 --> 09:58.799
(phone beeps)

10:01.068 --> 10:02.670
NELSON: And using his connection
to the Freelane network,

10:02.703 --> 10:05.973
our thieves accessed his phone
and searched every app.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.808
That's why there's
digital dust everywhere.

10:07.841 --> 10:11.244
So it starts with the Flash
Squad finding Freelane users

10:11.278 --> 10:13.146
to make purchases
at high-end stores.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.883
NELSON: They then use Freelane
to direct their users

10:15.916 --> 10:17.785
to a secluded spot, then...

10:17.818 --> 10:20.087
armed robbery.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.656
Joel Matthews' bank account
doesn't really paint a picture

10:22.690 --> 10:24.925
of a man who shops
at high-end boutiques.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.160
He's got less than two
grand in his savings.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.997
Hm. That's because
he wasn't shopping.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.702
Based on what I'm seeing
on his FriendAgenda page

10:34.735 --> 10:37.237
he was picking up a donation--
watches.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.940
He runs a charity auction
for a children's hospital.

10:39.973 --> 10:43.176
Just wanted to say thanks to the
106 local businesses that have

10:43.210 --> 10:44.812
already opened up their hearts.

10:44.845 --> 10:47.114
We still have 22 hours left
until the silent auction.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.448
It's not too late to donate.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.217
Help me give
some amazing kids

10:50.250 --> 10:51.819
another chance at life.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.186
So unfair.

10:53.220 --> 10:56.023
He seemed like such a good guy.

10:58.926 --> 11:01.762
Okay. Okay, Nelson.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.831
What is up?

11:03.864 --> 11:06.099
I think I found proof
in my stock exchange case

11:06.133 --> 11:08.902
that the FBI obtained
evidence unlawfully.

11:08.936 --> 11:10.838
What?!
For the past few
weeks I've been

11:10.871 --> 11:12.039
searching for the $8 million

11:12.072 --> 11:13.841
that went missing
in my stock market hack.

11:13.874 --> 11:14.842
And you found it?
No. No, no.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.043
I mean, it's long gone.

11:16.076 --> 11:18.712
But I did find that a crucial
piece of evidence the FBI

11:18.746 --> 11:21.381
used against me was outside the
scope of the federal warrant.

11:21.414 --> 11:25.152
But you told me that your
prosecutors had a strong case.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.821
Yeah, but my lawyer
said without this evidence...

11:27.855 --> 11:28.989
the case is thin.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.491
You hired a lawyer?

11:31.524 --> 11:32.592
I had to, okay?

11:32.625 --> 11:34.828
There's a chance that I can
overturn my conviction.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.263
But Nelson...

11:36.296 --> 11:38.231
you did hack the stock exchange.

11:38.265 --> 11:41.835
You know you were convicted
because you were guilty.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.503
No, what I know
is the FBI confiscated evidence

11:43.536 --> 11:44.738
without a warrant.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.741
Have you talked to Avery?

11:48.876 --> 11:50.844
No. I still don't know

11:50.878 --> 11:52.512
if I'm gonna file this
lawsuit against the FBI.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.816
A lawsuit?!
You could go to jail.

11:55.849 --> 11:58.251
Why would you want to risk that
over a technicality?

11:58.285 --> 11:59.987
'Cause I want to have control
over my own life again, Raven,

12:00.020 --> 12:02.422
that's why, okay?
You know? I want to...

12:02.455 --> 12:04.091
I want to hang out
with my old friends.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.960
Use a computer whenever,
wherever I want.

12:06.994 --> 12:09.963
Look, man, this is my chance.

12:09.997 --> 12:12.299
And I know
that it's risky, but...

12:12.332 --> 12:14.434
I'm feeling really,
really good about this.

12:14.467 --> 12:18.105
Promise me you're not gonna
get your hopes up too high.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.540
Because Avery--
she's gonna do

12:20.573 --> 12:23.410
what's best
for the Cyber Division...

12:23.443 --> 12:25.779
not Brody Nelson.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.316
RUSSELL: We're gonna be here
a while, till LAPD

12:29.349 --> 12:30.884
gets answers
from Caltrans.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.053
Yeah, well, now
that it's officially

12:33.086 --> 12:34.521
a criminal investigation,

12:34.554 --> 12:36.223
it's time for
the P.I. to bow out.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.258
No, you're right, you're right.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.796
Would it be wrong
for me to kiss you good-bye?

12:42.830 --> 12:45.265
Yes.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.267
(no voice)

12:47.300 --> 12:48.869
Do we care?

12:50.537 --> 12:52.539
Yes.

12:59.046 --> 13:00.280
(chuckles)

13:06.086 --> 13:08.221
Figure out why these
things are still down?

13:08.255 --> 13:09.422
Not yet.

13:09.456 --> 13:12.826
(crossing bell dinging)

13:13.460 --> 13:14.828
RUSSELL:
What'd you just do?

13:14.862 --> 13:16.897
Nothing.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.531
KRUMITZ:
Hey, guys...

13:18.565 --> 13:20.333
I think I'm doing that.

13:21.935 --> 13:24.037
The phone is telling the gate
to lower and then I put it

13:24.071 --> 13:25.839
in the Faraday Bag,
it blocks the signal,

13:25.873 --> 13:26.874
arm lifts
back up.

13:28.075 --> 13:29.576
RYAN: So, the cell
phone's communicating

13:29.609 --> 13:31.144
with the train
crossing.

13:31.178 --> 13:32.913
So when Joel Matthews' phone

13:32.946 --> 13:33.813
approached the train tracks,

13:33.847 --> 13:35.282
it somehow told
the crossing arm to drop,

13:35.315 --> 13:36.483
trapping him.
Oh, yeah,

13:36.516 --> 13:38.251
look at this--
discoloration of the bolt.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.287
MUNDO: Fresh tool marks.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.588
Bolt's still loose.

13:46.559 --> 13:47.594
RUSSELL:
Oh, yeah.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.129
I'm guessing this...

13:49.162 --> 13:51.231
is the device
that triggered the arm to drop.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.967
Okay, we got a cellular antenna.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.068
It's possible that it detected

13:55.102 --> 13:57.971
Joel's phone as they
approached the crossing here.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.372
According to the
police report,

13:59.406 --> 14:02.175
the last two robberies took
place at train crossings.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.344
The first two at dead ends.
So the Flash Squad

14:04.377 --> 14:07.414
rerouted their victims,
using that navigation app,

14:07.447 --> 14:09.516
then forced them to
stop here, trapping them.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.922
Ugh. I hope this
doesn't make us late.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.256
(bang)

14:16.289 --> 14:17.290
What the hell?

14:17.324 --> 14:19.359
(crossing bell dinging)

14:19.392 --> 14:21.261
Hands where I can see them!

14:21.294 --> 14:23.663
Don't even think
about moving.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.566
Joel...
Just give us the watches
and no one gets hurt.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.668
Yeah, but clearly, something
didn't go according to plans.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.271
So maybe Joel fought back,
there was a struggle...

14:31.304 --> 14:32.639
Get the watches from the car!

14:34.574 --> 14:35.909
That was not
a smart move.

14:35.943 --> 14:38.011
No, please, don't.
Don't shoot.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.215
No, no, I didn't see
anything, I swear.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.987
These girls are dangerous.
We have to get them

14:47.020 --> 14:49.456
off the street
before they kill again.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.258
(buzzing)

14:51.291 --> 14:54.594
Hey. I thought I told you
not to call me on my new phone.

14:55.996 --> 14:59.532
What... What do you mean
she's still alive?

14:59.566 --> 15:02.635
No. that's... that's impossible.

15:02.669 --> 15:05.438
You said they were both dead.

15:05.472 --> 15:06.439
Oh...

15:06.473 --> 15:08.942
Don't put this all on me.

15:08.976 --> 15:11.211
You're an accomplice, Sophia,
don't forget that.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.046
Grab your stuff
and get here now.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.081
And don't call me on this phone.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.225
MUNDO: Just got off the phone
with the hospital.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.627
Our female vic is still
unconscious, but

15:27.660 --> 15:29.329
she's no longer a Jane Doe.
Locals ran prints

15:29.362 --> 15:31.564
and got an I.D.
She's a child care worker.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.000
Riley Van Lowe, 20 years old.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.234
She's got a brother
in San Diego.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.369
He's been informed,
he's driving up.

15:36.403 --> 15:37.504
So now what?

15:37.537 --> 15:38.738
Flash Squad
usually posts a video

15:38.771 --> 15:40.573
of their latest
robbery within an hour,

15:40.607 --> 15:41.908
but nothing yet.
Yeah, and I don't
think they will.

15:41.941 --> 15:45.678
Killing Joel was an accident
and now they're scrambling.
Yeah.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.680
MUNDO: Botched robbery would
explain why they left that
Frankenstein'd device

15:47.714 --> 15:50.550
on the train crossing arm.
KRUMITZ:
Uh, actually, it's not

15:50.583 --> 15:52.352
just one device, it's two.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.387
See this here?
It's a microcell.

15:54.421 --> 15:57.524
People put it in their homes
to boost bad cell reception.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.993
And that one over there--
that's an industrial radio.

16:00.027 --> 16:01.328
The micro-controller,
here in the middle,

16:01.361 --> 16:04.097
acts as a bridge, lets
'em talk to each other.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.999
Can we trace these components
back to the person who built it?

16:06.033 --> 16:07.267
There are no fingerprints,

16:07.300 --> 16:10.270
no biologicals,
no forensic trace of any kind.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.339
Whoever assembled
this hardware--

16:12.372 --> 16:13.606
they were very careful.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.142
I've imaged each component.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.277
Sending it back
to Tear Down now.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.746
Basically, our last hope
is digital dust.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.614
NELSON:
All right, a million

16:21.648 --> 16:24.251
Web searches later, I think
I've got this figured out.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.685
Now, most rail lines
have something called

16:25.718 --> 16:27.154
Positive Train Control.

16:27.187 --> 16:28.521
It prevents accidents by putting

16:28.555 --> 16:30.023
train controls--
like brake systems,

16:30.057 --> 16:32.059
crossing guards-- online.

16:32.092 --> 16:34.027
So if a conductor falls asleep,

16:34.061 --> 16:37.530
someone in an office 100 miles
away could hit the brakes.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.732
Which is smart, if the threat
is a drowsy conductor.

16:39.766 --> 16:42.469
However, if the threat
is a sexy black hat thief...

16:42.502 --> 16:43.803
It makes it easier for them
to take control

16:43.836 --> 16:45.805
of the crossing arm.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.075
This device
was clearly homemade.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.043
The motherboard is exposed,
the soldering is raggedy,

16:50.077 --> 16:52.179
and all of the parts are from
different manufacturers.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.680
Yeah, and there's
no manual

16:53.713 --> 16:55.482
to follow to help you put
this kind of thing together,

16:55.515 --> 16:57.417
so... you go to the one source

16:57.450 --> 16:59.152
that can tell you
how to build anything:

17:00.153 --> 17:01.154
Internet.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.125
Which means our targets

17:05.158 --> 17:06.626
went through
the same process you did.

17:06.659 --> 17:09.162
Anyone who searched
for all these components

17:09.196 --> 17:10.230
is more than likely our target.

17:10.263 --> 17:12.065
Yeah.

17:12.099 --> 17:14.067
KRUMITZ: You are looking
at the search history

17:14.101 --> 17:15.668
of the entire population
of Los Angeles.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.604
That's 20-plus million people.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.739
However, I created filters

17:19.772 --> 17:21.774
based on search terms
associated with

17:21.808 --> 17:24.811
the rogue device and Nelson's
train research.

17:24.844 --> 17:27.147
20 million becomes 105.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.548
All right, that's still
a long list, though.

17:28.581 --> 17:31.118
We need to focus on what we know
about the hackers.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.420
All right, they're female,
they're in their early 20s.

17:33.453 --> 17:34.654
RUSSELL:
So we eliminate all men

17:34.687 --> 17:36.856
and all females outside
of the age range.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.758
All right, down to 30.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.827
We know they're obsessed
with celebrity culture.

17:40.860 --> 17:41.861
All right, so eliminate
anyone who hasn't

17:41.894 --> 17:45.232
done a search on gossip
or popular culture sites

17:45.265 --> 17:47.400
in the last 24 hours--
sites like TMZ

17:47.434 --> 17:49.336
or Gossip News Entertainment.

17:49.369 --> 17:50.537
KRUMITZ: Okay.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.105
Down to eight.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.173
Yes!
All right, what about

17:53.206 --> 17:54.174
the watches the girls

17:54.207 --> 17:56.143
stole from Joel?
There's a chance they would've

17:56.176 --> 17:57.510
looked into their value
before committing

17:57.544 --> 17:58.811
to the robbery, right?

17:58.845 --> 18:01.314
Narrowing down
to anyone searching

18:01.348 --> 18:03.216
for Ball watches...

18:05.785 --> 18:08.255
One result. Boom, right there.
(phone buzzes)

18:08.288 --> 18:09.756
All right, Krumitz,
match that IP address

18:09.789 --> 18:11.891
to a physical address.
Elijah, you're with SWAT.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.326
Hello?

18:13.360 --> 18:14.894
SILVER: Deputy Director,
I've just been informed

18:14.927 --> 18:16.496
that one of your black hats

18:16.529 --> 18:18.265
is bringing a lawsuit
against the FBI.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.233
What?

18:20.267 --> 18:21.701
I'm looking at
the legal documents right now.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.870
They just hit my desk.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.739
Uh, sir, a-a few weeks ago,

18:26.773 --> 18:30.577
I testified at Raven Ramirez's
5K1 hearing.

18:30.610 --> 18:34.181
My recommendation was that
she spend more time with Cyber.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.515
I guess she filed a suit.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.717
But the lawsuit
wasn't filed by Ms. Ramirez.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.752
It was filed by Brody Nelson.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.192
I don't know what to say.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.927
Sir... I need some time

18:47.960 --> 18:49.762
to figure out what is going on.

18:49.796 --> 18:53.166
Talk to Mr. Nelson.
Then get back to me.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.268
Avery, we've got an address.

18:58.271 --> 19:00.440
AGENT:
Hup! Let's go, hup!

19:00.473 --> 19:02.442
FBI!

19:03.710 --> 19:04.877
OFFICER: Clear!
OFFICER 2: Don't move!

19:04.911 --> 19:06.179
Clear.

19:06.213 --> 19:07.714
OFFICER:
Freeze.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.516
OFFICER:
All clear.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.951
MUNDO:
It's clear!

19:11.984 --> 19:14.321
It's all clear.
Oh, wow.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.223
I didn't even know you could
find a couch that shade of pink.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.324
AGENT:
Yeah, there's nobody here.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.861
Guys, what do you see
in each one of these photos?

19:21.894 --> 19:23.796
That's Riley Van Lowe.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.498
RUSSELL:
The female victim.

19:25.532 --> 19:26.933
RYAN:
She wasn't a victim at all.

19:26.966 --> 19:29.236
She didn't even know
Joel Matthews.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.570
She met him is the night
she went to rob him.

19:30.603 --> 19:31.604
Riley Van Lowe
is a member of the Flash Squad.

19:41.248 --> 19:43.316
All right, cheap furniture,
but the closet's full

19:43.350 --> 19:44.651
of high-end clothes,
shoes, and handbags.

19:44.684 --> 19:45.852
RUSSELL:
Got a shoebox

19:45.885 --> 19:47.620
full of expensive-looking
jewelry.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.290
Oh, yeah,
here we go--

19:50.323 --> 19:52.359
it's the amethyst ring
that we saw in the video.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.229
I just found evidence
on Ms. Van Lowe's laptop

19:56.263 --> 19:58.231
proving that
this device was used

19:58.265 --> 20:00.367
to shoot the Flash Squad
videos, confirming that

20:00.400 --> 20:01.368
she was part of that robbery.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.436
Standard soldering kit.
This has everything

20:03.470 --> 20:04.237
they would need
to rig the device

20:04.271 --> 20:07.006
used to hack
the train-crossing arm.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.741
So Riley is the Flash Squad's
hardware hacker.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.577
This changes everything
that happened that night.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.279
What the hell?!

20:12.312 --> 20:14.381
Hands where I
can see them!

20:14.414 --> 20:16.283
Don't even think
about moving!
Please.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.284
Don't.

20:17.317 --> 20:18.251
Which leaves one big

20:18.285 --> 20:19.218
unanswered question.

20:19.252 --> 20:21.554
Yeah. Why was Riley shot
during the robbery?

20:21.588 --> 20:22.589
Well, maybe Joel Matthews

20:22.622 --> 20:24.724
got a gun away from one
of the girls and shot her.

20:24.757 --> 20:27.327
It's not possible. There's no
GSR trace on his hands.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.628
MUNDO: Well, we know from
the police report that Riley's

20:28.661 --> 20:30.530
gunshot wound was not
self-inflicted.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.898
Something happened that night

20:31.931 --> 20:33.800
that caused one of those girls
to shoot her.

20:33.833 --> 20:34.901
MUNDO: Unfortunately,
we can't ask Riley.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.303
Her condition is the same.

20:36.336 --> 20:38.371
She's stable, but unconscious.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.939
RUSSELL: Riley knows
all the details

20:39.972 --> 20:41.608
of what happened
at the train crossing.

20:41.641 --> 20:42.975
She's of value to us.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.312
But she's gonna be
a huge threat to her friends.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.646
If she wakes up.

20:46.679 --> 20:47.780
MUNDO:
Yeah, I'm gonna put

20:47.814 --> 20:48.948
two uniforms on her right now.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.783
Make sure we have eyes
on Ms. Van Lowe

20:50.817 --> 20:53.286
at all times.
MAN:
What do you mean I can't go in?

20:53.320 --> 20:56.356
What do you mean I can't go in?!
Someone tell me what happened

20:56.389 --> 20:57.390
to my little sister!

20:59.892 --> 21:02.562
Uh, Mister, uh, Van Lowe...

21:02.595 --> 21:04.631
I'm FBI Deputy Director
Avery Ryan.

21:04.664 --> 21:07.400
We need to talk.

21:07.434 --> 21:09.802
What if she wakes up?
This is bad.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.471
I mean bad bad.
What are we gonna do?

21:11.504 --> 21:12.705
I don't know.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.307
I don't know.
Just shut up and let me think.

21:14.341 --> 21:15.375
What if she rats us out?

21:15.408 --> 21:17.076
She wanted to call the cops
back at the tracks.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.746
If she does, that's your fault.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.013
You're the one who wanted

21:21.047 --> 21:22.549
to bring her
into the group.
You said

21:22.582 --> 21:23.816
we needed someone good
with hardware.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.084
I was just trying to help.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.519
Well, you didn't help, Sophia.

21:26.553 --> 21:27.887
You brought us a problem.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.088
(sighs heavily)

21:29.121 --> 21:30.690
How much cash
do you have on you?

21:30.723 --> 21:32.692
I don't know.

21:32.725 --> 21:34.394
60 bucks, maybe.

21:34.427 --> 21:35.928
We gotta get out of here.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.365
We can sell some
of the stuff we stole.

21:38.398 --> 21:40.433
I don't think
running is a good idea.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.834
We should just
turn ourselves in,

21:41.868 --> 21:43.603
explain this was just
supposed to be fun,

21:43.636 --> 21:45.104
nobody was supposed to get hurt.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.440
Are you crazy?
This isn't high school.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.476
We killed someone.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.846
We got only one option.

21:56.416 --> 21:58.818
We're getting
the hell out of here

21:58.851 --> 22:00.553
together.

22:00.587 --> 22:03.390
Say it.
Okay.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.992
Okay. We run.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.860
MADISON:
I know you've been waiting

22:07.894 --> 22:09.796
for our latest video,
so here it is.

22:09.829 --> 22:13.500
Wanted to show you some of
the hot items we just picked up.

22:13.533 --> 22:15.968
Uh, my sister was studying
to be a clinical engineer.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.371
She wanted to help people,
not hurt them.

22:18.405 --> 22:20.940
There's no way
Riley's one of these girls.

22:20.973 --> 22:23.676
We matched
this amethyst birthstone ring

22:23.710 --> 22:25.778
to one that we found here
in the apartment.

22:25.812 --> 22:26.946
The ring was never

22:26.979 --> 22:29.449
on the list of items
reported stolen.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.151
My mom gave her that ring.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.487
This makes no sense.

22:34.521 --> 22:38.491
Do you recognize any of these
girls as your sister's friends?

22:38.525 --> 22:39.826
Their voices maybe?

22:39.859 --> 22:41.561
No. Riley had a hard time
making friends.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.062
She was always
so focused on school.

22:43.095 --> 22:46.533
We haven't spoken since
she moved to L.A. two years ago.

22:46.566 --> 22:48.535
I hated the guy she was dating.

22:48.568 --> 22:49.969
She stopped taking my calls.

22:50.002 --> 22:53.506
I was so excited
to get a call about Riley.

22:53.540 --> 22:55.808
Then I found out
she's in the hospital,

22:55.842 --> 22:57.944
and now you're telling me
she's a thief.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.612
I just...

22:59.646 --> 23:01.714
It's a lot to process.

23:01.748 --> 23:04.183
Do you know who shot her?

23:04.216 --> 23:06.953
We're still trying to figure out
what happened last night.

23:06.986 --> 23:09.055
RAMIREZ:
I have been through

23:09.088 --> 23:12.492
all of Riley Van Lowe's social
media accounts and e-mails.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.794
There's not a single mention
of Flash Squad or anything

23:14.827 --> 23:17.430
that can help identify
the other members of the crew.

23:17.464 --> 23:18.765
I scanned Riley's hard drive.

23:18.798 --> 23:21.133
Her computer wasn't responsible
for the Freelane hack.

23:21.167 --> 23:23.503
(phone beeps)

23:25.171 --> 23:26.639
What's with the face?

23:26.673 --> 23:28.741
Avery just texted me.
(scoffs)

23:28.775 --> 23:30.910
She must have found out
about the lawsuit.

23:30.943 --> 23:35.515
Nelson, you filed without
talking to Avery? Why?

23:35.548 --> 23:37.684
Because in the case
of Brody Nelson against the USA,

23:37.717 --> 23:39.486
Avery is the USA.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.788
(computer beeping)

23:41.821 --> 23:44.023
This is weird. Riley has
a second e-mail account.

23:44.056 --> 23:45.458
She's been logging in and out

23:45.492 --> 23:47.527
almost every day for
the past two months,

23:47.560 --> 23:48.761
but it's empty.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.129
You mean she's been
deleting her e-mails?

23:50.162 --> 23:52.832
Hold on. I'll run
a recovery program.

23:52.865 --> 23:55.034
That was fast.

23:55.067 --> 23:57.570
Because there's nothing
to recover.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.205
No messages were ever
sent or received.

23:59.238 --> 24:01.040
Okay, so why would she set up
an e-mail account

24:01.073 --> 24:04.176
that she signs into every day
but doesn't use?

24:04.210 --> 24:06.112
This is why.

24:06.145 --> 24:08.047
The draft folder.
There's one item.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.216
Exactly. Call Krumitz.

24:10.249 --> 24:11.784
Raven just got us
our first lead.

24:11.818 --> 24:14.120
Could help us identify the rest
of the Flash Squad.

24:14.153 --> 24:16.623
They communicated
through an e-mail account,

24:16.656 --> 24:18.124
but never actually sent
any e-mails.

24:18.157 --> 24:19.425
Riley and her
accomplices--

24:19.458 --> 24:22.562
they shared log-in credentials
for the same e-mail account,

24:22.595 --> 24:24.564
but they never sent e-mails
to each other.

24:24.597 --> 24:27.867
They just wrote wrote drafts
and then saved them.

24:29.168 --> 24:30.136
MUNDO:
Terrorists and cartels

24:30.169 --> 24:31.203
have been communicating this way

24:31.237 --> 24:33.706
for years, thinking it leaves
no digital trail.

24:33.740 --> 24:36.075
Krumitz, do you think you can
recover previous versions

24:36.108 --> 24:37.276
of these draft e-mails?

24:37.309 --> 24:38.645
Yeah. On it.

24:38.678 --> 24:40.046
(computer chirping)

24:43.115 --> 24:45.585
We got nothing.

24:45.618 --> 24:47.587
No names, nicknames, addresses,

24:47.620 --> 24:50.523
anything in these drafts
that can get us an identity.

24:50.557 --> 24:52.692
Hey, maybe we can predict
a pattern of behavior,

24:52.725 --> 24:55.294
speculate on their next move,
based on these e-mails.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.129
What are we looking for exactly?

24:57.163 --> 25:00.600
A pattern of speech,
like a hierarchy.

25:00.633 --> 25:02.635
Like this one, for instance.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.571
She uses assertive
language,

25:04.604 --> 25:06.038
she likes to call the shots.

25:06.072 --> 25:08.641
"Take the SUV and pick me up
at 8:00.

25:08.675 --> 25:10.877
I am finally gonna
be famous!"

25:10.910 --> 25:12.311
Now she is the alpha.

25:12.344 --> 25:16.816
All right, this one's quick
to agree, reiterates the order.

25:16.849 --> 25:20.019
"Perfect. I'll bring my laptop,
reroute him from the car."

25:20.052 --> 25:22.555
"Hope GNE uses
a good photo of us."

25:22.589 --> 25:23.422
Well, she's a follower.

25:23.455 --> 25:25.592
She will always be loyal
to the leader.

25:25.625 --> 25:26.893
She is a beta.

25:26.926 --> 25:29.896
Clearly, they are both
preoccupied with fame.

25:29.929 --> 25:31.263
Okay, so this is beta.

25:31.297 --> 25:32.832
Then I got a candidate
for omega.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.000
"I'm up for whatever.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.802
"Sorry it took me so long
to respond.

25:35.835 --> 25:37.704
You guys always know
better than I do."

25:37.737 --> 25:39.071
She's the omega.

25:39.105 --> 25:41.708
Subservient, apologetic,
self-deprecating.

25:41.741 --> 25:45.678
Now... it's time
for us to play shrink.

25:45.712 --> 25:48.948
*

26:13.906 --> 26:16.876
RUSSELL:
Riley's e-mails to her friends
are very telling.

26:17.977 --> 26:19.311
You know, I'm
starting to think

26:19.345 --> 26:22.014
that Riley Van Lowe
is our omega.
I agree.

26:22.048 --> 26:24.316
She consistently uses
subservient language

26:24.350 --> 26:25.852
in all her personal e-mails.

26:25.885 --> 26:28.320
And look at this one
to one of her professors.

26:28.354 --> 26:31.023
She seems to be struggling
with her tuition.

26:31.057 --> 26:33.826
Her brother said that she always
had a hard time making friends,

26:33.860 --> 26:36.395
so by joining the Flash Squad,
she was able to do both.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.965
Right, grab a little quick cash
for tuition

26:38.998 --> 26:40.833
and feel accepted
at the same time.

26:40.867 --> 26:44.370
These girls pressured her
to join the Flash Squad. Why?

26:44.403 --> 26:46.372
Well, Riley was
the hardware hacker, right?

26:46.405 --> 26:49.041
They needed her to rig
the train hacking device.

26:49.075 --> 26:51.277
All of these girls have
their own unique talents

26:51.310 --> 26:52.745
they bring to the squad.

26:52.779 --> 26:55.715
Know what? You're right.
The beta was the coder.

26:55.748 --> 26:57.416
She rerouted from the car.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.652
Alpha just seems like
she's getting rich off

26:59.686 --> 27:01.888
the other two girls'
hacking skills.
She's the muscle.

27:01.921 --> 27:03.956
She takes charge,
she intimidates.

27:03.990 --> 27:06.693
You know what? The omega.

27:06.726 --> 27:08.995
The omegas shows fear, right?

27:09.028 --> 27:10.763
They could become a liability.

27:10.797 --> 27:13.966
I think this is the reason
why Riley Van Lowe got shot.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.335
Grab the watches.
(crossing bell clanging)

27:18.304 --> 27:19.806
That was not a smart move.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.808
I'm begging you...
(Riley gasps)

27:21.841 --> 27:22.809
(groaning)

27:22.842 --> 27:24.944
You shot him!
What the hell

27:24.977 --> 27:26.078
are you doing, Madison?!

27:26.112 --> 27:27.747
Just get the watches, Riley!

27:27.780 --> 27:29.348
Let's go!

27:29.381 --> 27:30.917
We can't just leave him here.

27:30.950 --> 27:33.019
We have to call the cops.
He could die.

27:33.052 --> 27:34.286
Do not call the police!

27:34.320 --> 27:35.454
Riley, do what she says.

27:35.487 --> 27:36.989
This was never part of the plan!

27:37.023 --> 27:39.191
You don't make the plan.

27:39.225 --> 27:42.762
I make the plan, so
put the phone down!

27:42.795 --> 27:44.096
(grunting)

27:44.130 --> 27:45.197
Put the phone...

27:45.231 --> 27:47.099
(Riley groans)
down!

27:47.133 --> 27:49.736
(Riley panting, Sophia gasps)

27:49.769 --> 27:50.970
Hey, what did you do?!

27:51.003 --> 27:53.439
(crossing bell clanging)

27:55.507 --> 27:57.176
Just grab the watches!

27:57.209 --> 27:59.812
(Sophia gasps and pants)

28:00.880 --> 28:02.749
(Sophia gasps)

28:04.250 --> 28:06.218
Just got off the phone
with LAPD.

28:06.252 --> 28:08.054
Riley Van Lowe is conscious.

28:08.087 --> 28:10.790
First thing she did--
asked for a lawyer.

28:10.823 --> 28:12.358
We're not gonna get
anything else from her.

28:12.391 --> 28:13.726
KRUMITZ:
More bad news.

28:13.760 --> 28:14.927
Just compared notes
with Raven and Nelson.

28:14.961 --> 28:17.730
Looks like the Flash Squad used
the same Syrian IP address

28:17.764 --> 28:20.232
to stay anonymous for
the Freelane hack, the videos

28:20.266 --> 28:22.068
and the draft e-mails.

28:22.101 --> 28:24.370
So these two girls have
shot a man in cold blood

28:24.403 --> 28:26.806
and left nothing behind
but digital dead ends?

28:26.839 --> 28:28.107
RYAN: No, no, no.
Wait, wait.

28:28.140 --> 28:30.476
The Flash Squad
revealed their weakness

28:30.509 --> 28:33.880
in these draft e-mails.
What is the one thing

28:33.913 --> 28:35.047
that they care more about?

28:35.081 --> 28:38.150
To be famous. GNE.

28:38.184 --> 28:40.152
Exactly.

28:40.186 --> 28:41.187
And that is how
we're gonna catch them.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.462
Listen up, bitches.
We're the Flash Squad.

28:50.496 --> 28:51.964
This is how we do.

28:51.998 --> 28:53.933
MALE ANNOUNCER:
That's right, these

28:53.966 --> 28:55.968
rainbowed-visor vixens
want your stuff.

28:56.002 --> 28:57.770
But let's be real.

28:57.804 --> 29:00.139
With legs like that,
all they had to do was ask.

29:00.172 --> 29:01.874
RUSSELL:
Okay, so, we're gonna get

29:01.908 --> 29:04.977
GNE to post our fake video
on their Web site,

29:05.011 --> 29:07.179
and then to blast the
link out on ToggleFly.

29:07.213 --> 29:09.248
The Flash Squad
wants to be famous.

29:09.281 --> 29:11.918
The second that they see
their name in a headline,

29:11.951 --> 29:13.319
they'll click on that link.

29:13.352 --> 29:15.287
The moment they do,
the super cookie I embedded

29:15.321 --> 29:18.024
into the Web page will send us
back their real IP address.

29:18.057 --> 29:19.792
Right, but isn't
this a public site?

29:19.826 --> 29:21.193
Aren't thousands of
other other people

29:21.227 --> 29:23.195
gonna be seeing
the same page?

29:23.229 --> 29:26.365
The way Flash Squad's trending,
more like hundreds of thousands.

29:26.398 --> 29:28.968
But the beauty
of the super cookie is

29:29.001 --> 29:31.437
that after it sends us
each visitor's IP,

29:31.470 --> 29:32.872
it attaches itself
to their browser

29:32.905 --> 29:34.941
and spies
on their Web traffic.

29:34.974 --> 29:37.176
We'll be able to see every place
the users go

29:37.209 --> 29:38.911
after they visit
the GNE site.

29:38.945 --> 29:40.913
Hopefully,
based on the sites they visit,

29:40.947 --> 29:42.548
we'll be able
to identify our targets.

29:42.581 --> 29:43.883
If they take the bait.

29:43.916 --> 29:45.217
RYAN:
These girls--

29:45.251 --> 29:48.054
they won't be
able to help themselves.

29:48.087 --> 29:51.223
SOPHIA:
This place is so vile.

29:51.257 --> 29:52.859
How long do we
have to stay here?

29:52.892 --> 29:54.827
(phone dings twice)

29:54.861 --> 29:56.528
(chimes)

29:56.562 --> 29:58.597
Oh, my God!

29:58.630 --> 30:01.868
Maddie, we did it!
We're on GNE!

30:01.901 --> 30:03.235
We did it!

30:03.269 --> 30:04.470
(laughs)

30:04.503 --> 30:06.906
KRUMITZ:
Okay, this thing's going viral.

30:06.939 --> 30:09.441
200,000 views and climbing.
Nelson, Raven,

30:09.475 --> 30:11.210
you seeing this?
NELSON:
This is insane.

30:11.243 --> 30:13.379
NELSON: It's just BuzzFeed,
Kardashians, FriendAgenda

30:13.412 --> 30:14.914
over and over again.

30:14.947 --> 30:15.982
RAMIREZ: Everyone who's
watched this video

30:16.015 --> 30:17.116
is going to the same sites.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.484
How are we gonna
isolate the Flash Squad?

30:18.517 --> 30:20.286
RYAN: Human behavior
is reliable

30:20.319 --> 30:22.855
and disloyalty
is their greatest fear.

30:22.889 --> 30:23.789
ANNOUNCER:
Can't get enough?

30:23.822 --> 30:25.992
Good, 'cause we've got
more Flash Squad.

30:26.025 --> 30:27.493
Ah! This is so awesome!

30:27.526 --> 30:28.594
(both laugh)

30:28.627 --> 30:31.463
ANNOUNCER: Check back
in the a.m. for an exclusive

30:31.497 --> 30:33.499
tell-all interview
with the group's leader

30:33.532 --> 30:36.035
after she's released
from police custody.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.371
Riley woke up.

30:39.405 --> 30:40.940
"Leader"?

30:40.973 --> 30:43.976
She's going to tell
them everything.

30:44.010 --> 30:47.579
They're calling her the leader?

30:47.613 --> 30:49.115
(sighs)

30:49.148 --> 30:50.582
Oh, my God.

30:50.616 --> 30:51.918
RAMIREZ:
Guys, I don't know about this.

30:51.951 --> 30:54.353
The IP addresses are coming in
so fast.

30:54.386 --> 30:55.988
NELSON:
Right there!

30:56.022 --> 30:58.157
Someone just searched for
"Riley Van Lowe plus leader."

30:58.190 --> 31:00.092
RYAN:
Th-That's it! That's them!

31:00.126 --> 31:02.261
Besides us, the Flash Squad
are the only people

31:02.294 --> 31:03.963
that know Riley's name.

31:03.996 --> 31:04.997
They took the bait.

31:05.031 --> 31:06.032
RAMIREZ:
Got the IP address.

31:06.065 --> 31:07.266
Give me a second to recover

31:07.299 --> 31:08.567
the physical
address associated

31:08.600 --> 31:10.036
with the search.

31:10.069 --> 31:11.203
Got it.

31:11.237 --> 31:13.205
I'm sending the address
to you now.

31:13.239 --> 31:15.975
It-it looks like a motel
off the 405 Freeway.

31:22.949 --> 31:23.916
Clear!

31:23.950 --> 31:25.317
AGENT: Clear!
AGENT 2:
Yeah, nothing back here.

31:25.351 --> 31:26.285
Okay,

31:26.318 --> 31:28.687
so, the motel manager says
two girls paid cash.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.689
He did not get
a good look at them.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.692
They jumped in a car and
headed west a few minutes ago.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.427
Didn't catch the make
or model either.

31:35.461 --> 31:37.696
These girls are scared.
They're feeling out of control.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.398
They know that we're
closing in on them.

31:39.431 --> 31:41.067
They won't draw attention
to themselves.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.368
Yeah, but we don't even have
a description.

31:42.401 --> 31:43.369
RUSSELL: Whoa.
Wait a second here.

31:43.402 --> 31:44.436
Now...

31:44.470 --> 31:46.272
the girls don't know that,
though.

31:46.305 --> 31:47.173
You know what?
You're right.

31:47.206 --> 31:49.041
As far as they know,
Riley gave them up,

31:49.075 --> 31:51.310
and every cop on every corner
could have their photo.

31:51.343 --> 31:52.611
Which means
they'll do anything

31:52.644 --> 31:54.413
they can
to avoid law enforcement.

31:54.446 --> 31:55.948
Freelane.
It gives the location

31:55.982 --> 31:57.483
of police officers--
they'll use the app

31:57.516 --> 31:59.218
to try to escape.
Right. Instead of

31:59.251 --> 32:01.954
chasing our targets,
we use the Freelane app

32:01.988 --> 32:05.057
to report police sightings
and herd them right to us.

32:07.159 --> 32:09.628
I'm rerouting the Freelane users
to the 5 Freeway.

32:09.661 --> 32:11.697
We'll have a clear path
on the 405 South,

32:11.730 --> 32:13.665
all the way to Mexico.
(laughs)

32:13.699 --> 32:15.067
I can taste the tequila already.

32:15.101 --> 32:16.402
(laughs):
Ooh.

32:16.435 --> 32:18.704
Uh, okay, po-po ahead.
Turn left here.

32:18.737 --> 32:22.408
(turn signal clicking)

32:22.441 --> 32:23.209
Another cop.

32:23.242 --> 32:24.343
Make a right.

32:24.376 --> 32:26.378
(turn signal clicking)

32:26.412 --> 32:29.381
Oh, my God.
They're everywhere.

32:29.415 --> 32:30.716
Just head down that street.

32:30.749 --> 32:32.684
(tires screeching)

32:32.718 --> 32:34.520
(tires screeching,
engine revving)

32:37.089 --> 32:38.257
Okay, good, good...

32:40.126 --> 32:42.028
(chuckles)

32:42.061 --> 32:43.762
(chuckles)
Just make a right
up here.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.131
There's
a freeway entrance.

32:45.164 --> 32:46.265
(siren wailing)

32:46.298 --> 32:48.134
I thought you said
it was clear!

32:48.167 --> 32:49.568
What the hell is this?!

32:49.601 --> 32:50.702
(tires screech)
Damn it, Sophia!

32:50.736 --> 32:54.106
Okay, back up! Back up! Go!

32:54.140 --> 32:56.408
(siren wailing)

32:56.442 --> 32:57.343
(grunts)

32:57.376 --> 32:59.578
(tires screeching)

33:01.613 --> 33:02.681
OFFICER:
Out of the vehicle!

33:02.714 --> 33:05.351
MUNDO: FBI! Hands in the air!
Get out of the car!

33:05.384 --> 33:07.419
Step out of the vehicle!
KRUMITZ: Right now!

33:07.453 --> 33:10.022
Do it right now!
Hands on the hood!

33:10.056 --> 33:12.324
OFFICER 2:
Cover the car!

33:14.360 --> 33:15.794
Just keep your
mouth shut, Sophia.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.663
(handcuffs clicking)
RYAN:
Well, I hope

33:17.696 --> 33:20.766
the Flash Squad enjoys
their 15 minutes of fame.

33:20.799 --> 33:23.369
RUSSELL:
You guys are gonna look great
in orange jumpsuit couture!

33:23.402 --> 33:25.137
(Ryan chuckles)
(phone chimes)

33:26.205 --> 33:28.074
If you don't mind, I think

33:28.107 --> 33:30.442
I'm gonna, uh, catch up
with you guys in DC,

33:30.476 --> 33:32.378
soak up
a little more L.A. sunshine.

33:32.411 --> 33:35.447
Oh, well, give my best to Greer.

33:35.481 --> 33:37.649
(helicopter hovering,
officers shouting commands)

33:37.683 --> 33:39.685
(siren wailing in distance)

33:45.857 --> 33:48.060
(laughs)

33:49.095 --> 33:51.130
You made it.

33:51.163 --> 33:53.399
Wow.
Me?

33:53.432 --> 33:55.201
Or the view?

33:57.669 --> 33:59.838
The view.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.840
All of it.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.809
Come sit.

34:10.882 --> 34:13.252
My father worked right there.

34:13.285 --> 34:14.853
I loved that
building.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.155
RUSSELL:
You're kidding me.

34:16.188 --> 34:17.489
You know,
that-that building

34:17.523 --> 34:19.158
is the best example of art deco

34:19.191 --> 34:20.759
that's still left in L.A.

34:20.792 --> 34:23.095
I love art deco.
I always have.

34:23.129 --> 34:26.198
Have you ever seen
the Palais de Chaillot?

34:26.232 --> 34:28.367
Paris. No.
I haven't been there.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.669
It's on my bucket list.

34:32.338 --> 34:35.674
I'm considering
taking a job there.

34:37.343 --> 34:38.577
You should come.

34:38.610 --> 34:40.179
Check it off your list.

34:41.213 --> 34:43.249
How long you gonna be there?

34:43.282 --> 34:44.516
Six to eight months.

34:44.550 --> 34:47.153
Still up in the air.

34:48.387 --> 34:49.621
Uh...

34:49.655 --> 34:51.823
I wish I could do that.

34:51.857 --> 34:55.361
I'm afraid my, um...
my Seahawks

34:55.394 --> 34:57.629
would be hopeless without me
on game day.

34:57.663 --> 34:59.665
And there's

34:59.698 --> 35:01.467
no football in France.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.546
What are you doing?

35:14.580 --> 35:16.748
I'm asking you to dance.

35:19.185 --> 35:20.586
But there's no music.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.554
Sure there is.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.830
What song are you dancing to?

35:31.863 --> 35:34.400
"Macarena," of course.
(chuckles)
(laughs)

35:49.315 --> 35:50.949
I'm not Joel Matthews.

35:50.982 --> 35:53.285
He was much better
at this type of thing.

35:53.319 --> 35:55.587
But I'm gonna give it a whirl,

35:55.621 --> 35:58.324
because I thought Joel's friends
and family should know that

35:58.357 --> 36:02.328
the event he spent so many hours
planning raised over $150,000

36:02.361 --> 36:04.463
for the children's hospital
last night.

36:04.496 --> 36:07.366
Joel was a great man
and a great friend. We're all

36:07.399 --> 36:09.201
gonna miss him very much.

36:09.235 --> 36:11.703
How cool is that? And all
these people are pledging

36:11.737 --> 36:14.406
more donations on his
FriendAgenda memorial page.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.242
Yeah. Good to see
not everyone out there's

36:16.275 --> 36:19.311
a materialistic fame junky.
(chuckles)

36:22.381 --> 36:24.383
One second.

36:28.454 --> 36:29.921
Why didn't you come to me first?

36:29.955 --> 36:31.723
And say what,
that I think I found evidence

36:31.757 --> 36:33.292
of FBI misconduct?

36:33.325 --> 36:34.393
I would have helped you.

36:34.426 --> 36:35.727
Really, Avery? 'Cause I saw

36:35.761 --> 36:36.995
how much you helped Raven.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.597
Hey, that's out of line.

36:38.630 --> 36:42.000
Raven's case was a completely
different circumstance.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.670
Listen, I appreciate everything
that you've done--

36:44.703 --> 36:47.606
bringing me here, believing
in me when no one else would.

36:47.639 --> 36:49.241
But this,

36:49.275 --> 36:51.743
we're talking about my life.
You need to know,

36:51.777 --> 36:53.279
if you go down this path,

36:53.312 --> 36:54.913
it could have
very real consequences.

36:54.946 --> 36:57.383
Suing the FBI
without coming to me first

36:57.416 --> 36:58.517
is not the way
to go about this.

36:58.550 --> 36:59.885
Are you mad because
I didn't come to you

36:59.918 --> 37:01.887
or because the FBI screwed up

37:01.920 --> 37:03.622
and it reflects poorly on you?

37:03.655 --> 37:06.492
Nelson, you're dangerously close
to insubordination.

37:06.525 --> 37:08.594
I am mad!

37:08.627 --> 37:11.663
I'm mad
because if you lose this,

37:11.697 --> 37:13.499
they can revoke your plea deal.

37:14.700 --> 37:17.369
You'll have a lot less freedom
behind bars.

37:17.403 --> 37:19.938
Well, maybe that's-that's a risk
I'm willing to take.

37:19.971 --> 37:21.307
(knocking on door)

37:23.008 --> 37:27.313
The exact two people
I wanted to see.

37:27.346 --> 37:30.316
You filed a lawsuit
against the FBI.

37:30.349 --> 37:33.319
I wanted to know
if you're willing to drop it.

37:33.352 --> 37:34.820
Right now.

37:38.590 --> 37:39.825
(sighs)

37:39.858 --> 37:41.560
What happened in my case...

37:41.593 --> 37:44.363
(sighs)
wasn't right.

37:44.396 --> 37:45.831
And what the FBI

37:45.864 --> 37:47.299
did was wrong.

37:47.333 --> 37:49.668
And it led
to my conviction.

37:49.701 --> 37:54.440
So, no, sir... I'm not
willing to drop this.

37:54.473 --> 37:56.342
I'm seeing this through
to the end.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.744
All right.

37:58.777 --> 38:01.747
Effective immediately, the FBI

38:01.780 --> 38:04.550
is dropping all charges
against Brody Nelson.

38:04.583 --> 38:07.285
Your record
will be expunged.

38:08.487 --> 38:10.356
You're a free man.

38:10.389 --> 38:12.391
(gasps)

38:14.526 --> 38:17.496
I know that
Cyber's Hacker-for-Hire program

38:17.529 --> 38:18.997
is important to you.

38:19.030 --> 38:21.367
It's more than important, sir.
It's always been

38:21.400 --> 38:22.734
a trial program.

38:22.768 --> 38:24.370
It wasn't to me, Marcus.

38:24.403 --> 38:25.270
SILVER:
I understand that, Avery.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.105
But this program
has gotten away from you.

38:27.138 --> 38:29.107
I don't think
that's a fair characterization.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.009
Nelson's lawsuit isn't...
Nelson's lawsuit

38:31.042 --> 38:32.678
is just the latest example.

38:32.711 --> 38:35.013
Do I really need
to remind you of Tobin

38:35.046 --> 38:38.717
and the secret files
he stole on your watch?

38:38.750 --> 38:40.952
Avery, after
considerable thought,

38:40.986 --> 38:42.821
I'm terminating the program.

38:45.391 --> 38:47.659
RYAN:
With all due respect, sir,

38:47.693 --> 38:49.495
hackers like Nelson
are the only ones

38:49.528 --> 38:51.029
who can keep up
with our enemies.

38:51.062 --> 38:52.431
Look, I'm the first
to admit

38:52.464 --> 38:55.100
that this program
has been less than perfect.

38:55.133 --> 38:56.602
But the way
these kids think,

38:56.635 --> 39:00.839
it's not something
you can teach in an academy.

39:00.872 --> 39:03.509
Without them,
y-you're tying my hands.

39:03.542 --> 39:05.444
You're making us
less safe.

39:05.477 --> 39:07.713
Sir, without them,

39:07.746 --> 39:09.715
you're making my job harder.

39:09.748 --> 39:12.418
Then your job is harder, Avery.

39:26.064 --> 39:27.699
What happened?
Director Silver

39:27.733 --> 39:29.468
just ended
the Hacker-for-Hire program.

39:29.501 --> 39:30.736
It's effective
immediately.

39:30.769 --> 39:33.472
What about your case?
Case dropped.

39:33.505 --> 39:34.740
Time served.

39:34.773 --> 39:37.476
Raven, we are free.

39:37.509 --> 39:39.077
We can go anywhere we want.

39:39.110 --> 39:40.111
No, Nelson.

39:40.145 --> 39:42.948
No, you' free
to go wherever you want.

39:42.981 --> 39:44.950
There was a loophole
in your case,

39:44.983 --> 39:46.485
not mine.

39:46.518 --> 39:49.154
If the Hacker-for-Hire program
is really gone,

39:49.187 --> 39:50.388
I'm going to jail.
