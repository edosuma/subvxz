09:11.818 --> 09:14.219
I'll take science
and nature for the block.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.754
I'm going out for some air.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.289
Okay, Mom.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.160
SHEGO:
Huh.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.296
Shouldn't Generation Y
be here by now?

09:24.298 --> 09:26.264
What's taking them so long?

09:26.266 --> 09:28.733
Yeah, maybe your plan
wasn't quite as off the heezy

09:28.735 --> 09:30.135
as you thought.

09:30.137 --> 09:32.571
Shut!

09:32.573 --> 09:34.306
I'm picking up movement.

09:34.308 --> 09:35.740
They're coming.

09:37.677 --> 09:41.346
Behold my army of youth.

09:43.783 --> 09:45.717
( <i>groans</i> )

09:45.719 --> 09:48.086
Who are you?

09:48.088 --> 09:49.754
Your army reporting for duty.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.790
( <i>laughing</i>)

09:51.792 --> 09:54.593
This? This is your
army of youth?!

09:54.595 --> 09:56.828
I think you missed
by about 50 years, Doc.

09:56.830 --> 09:59.264
The signals must not have been
properly tuned

09:59.266 --> 10:01.466
into the MP3 frequency.

10:01.468 --> 10:03.468
But then what am I
tapping into?

10:06.739 --> 10:07.806
Er, what say?

10:07.808 --> 10:08.773
Well done.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.108
Tapped into the hearing aid

10:10.110 --> 10:11.710
frequency, Dr. D.

10:11.712 --> 10:14.713
What am I supposed to do
with an army of retired people?

10:14.715 --> 10:16.381
Ooh, lemon squares.

10:16.383 --> 10:17.515
You can have them

10:17.517 --> 10:19.851
buy you discount tickets
for the movies.

10:19.853 --> 10:25.323
Mmm, ah. These lemon squares
are scrump-dilly-ishus.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.258
You know what?

10:27.260 --> 10:28.793
They're here, they're zombies.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.161
Might as well see

10:30.163 --> 10:31.763
what we can do with 'em.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.699
( <i>muffled</i> ):
Okay, follow me.

10:40.206 --> 10:42.140
Impressive.
I wonder

10:42.142 --> 10:43.908
if they can sell ice cream.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.213
Kim, go wake Nana
so we can go out to breakfast.

10:48.215 --> 10:49.214
Can do.

10:49.216 --> 10:51.149
( <i>yawns</i> )

10:51.151 --> 10:52.484
Hmm?

10:55.321 --> 10:57.789
Nana, we're going to breakfast.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.424
It's a buffet.

11:00.926 --> 11:02.627
Nana? What?

11:02.629 --> 11:06.498
Oh, is that the remote
for the TV?

11:06.500 --> 11:08.833
Silly me.

11:11.470 --> 11:14.639
RON: <i>Thanks for bringing us
here, Doctors P-squared.</i>

11:14.641 --> 11:16.508
This place rules so hard...

11:16.510 --> 11:18.443
almost makes up for yesterday's
spring breakage setback.

11:18.445 --> 11:21.513
Not having much luck
with the whole fresh start?

11:21.515 --> 11:22.614
You know, it's amazing.

11:22.616 --> 11:24.382
In one short day,
I managed to earn

11:24.384 --> 11:26.718
the socially-challenged rep
that took me a lifetime

11:26.720 --> 11:28.286
to cultivate back home.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.455
Rufus, on the other hand,
was named honorary mascot

11:30.457 --> 11:31.823
of five different sororities.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.224
Mm-hmm!

11:33.226 --> 11:35.193
( <i>beeping</i> )

11:35.195 --> 11:36.628
What do you got, Wade?

11:36.630 --> 11:38.463
A bunch of high-tech robberies
last night,

11:38.465 --> 11:39.464
all in your area.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.766
High-tech robberies.

11:41.768 --> 11:43.802
Naw, can't be.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.637
Not Nana.

11:45.639 --> 11:47.939
Ron and I are on it, Wade.

11:47.941 --> 11:48.907
What are those?

11:48.909 --> 11:50.208
( <i>electrical static</i> )

11:50.210 --> 11:51.443
Knitting needles?

11:51.445 --> 11:52.644
( <i>gasps</i> )

11:52.646 --> 11:54.245
Hmm.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.614
( <i>Rufus chittering</i> )

12:02.521 --> 12:03.621
Hmm.

12:03.623 --> 12:04.856
I don't know what it is,

12:04.858 --> 12:06.758
but we'll take some
and get it analyzed.

12:06.760 --> 12:07.726
Bag it, Rufus.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.627
Okay.

12:09.629 --> 12:11.663
You're still planning to go
through with your plan?

12:11.665 --> 12:13.531
Why not?

12:13.533 --> 12:15.867
Anyone could use an army of
teens to take over the world.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.302
It takes a true visionary

12:17.304 --> 12:19.370
to do it with an army
of senior citizens.

12:19.372 --> 12:23.808
I dare say my plan is more off
the heezy than ever before.

12:23.810 --> 12:25.877
If you say so.

12:29.782 --> 12:31.483
( <i>laughing maniacally</i>)

12:31.485 --> 12:33.818
It works! It works!

12:33.820 --> 12:35.487
( <i>laughs</i> )

12:35.489 --> 12:37.589
Now we just need to complete
the launch pad.

12:37.591 --> 12:40.959
Shego, my mature zombie army
still has much to offer.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.427
And there's no

12:42.429 --> 12:44.829
substitute for wisdom
and experience.

12:44.831 --> 12:47.932
Life begins at 65, you know.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.401
Where are you getting
this stuff, anyway?

12:50.403 --> 12:51.836
Read these brochures, Shego.

12:51.838 --> 12:53.571
They'll rock your world.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.573
Rufus, since you're, you
know, chillin' down here

12:55.575 --> 12:57.041
if I hang out with you

12:57.043 --> 12:58.777
that makes me chill, too, right?

12:58.779 --> 13:00.545
Hmm. Nope.

13:02.848 --> 13:04.849
But you're still going to help
me with the ladies, won't you?

13:04.851 --> 13:05.750
I need to chill.

13:05.752 --> 13:07.685
Hmm.

13:07.687 --> 13:09.821
Perhaps a gigante naco

13:09.823 --> 13:11.456
might help make up your mind.

13:11.458 --> 13:15.360
Mmm. Naco. Mmm, okay.

13:15.362 --> 13:18.563
Wade, see if you can
analyze this evidence.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.635
Kimberly Ann,
I'm very disappointed

13:23.637 --> 13:26.070
that you haven't taken
my advice.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.872
If you're looking for excitement

13:27.874 --> 13:30.408
why not ballroom dancing?

13:31.577 --> 13:32.510
Huh?

13:32.512 --> 13:34.579
I'm going out for some air.

Hey, the scan wasn't complete.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.964
Never mind, Wade.
I know what it is.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.532
This is so wrong.

14:27.566 --> 14:29.701
Wade, got anything on an old

14:29.703 --> 14:31.035
deserted gator farm?

14:31.037 --> 14:32.403
WADE:
Checking.

14:32.405 --> 14:35.073
Drakken?
My nana and Drakken?

14:35.075 --> 14:37.375
Okay, we're over
the weird limit here.

14:38.577 --> 14:39.744
( <i>gasps</i> )

14:39.746 --> 14:41.479
Hey, wait!

14:43.048 --> 14:45.516
Way over the weird limit.

Oh, my gosh!

Hey, I'm Ron.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.987
And that's R to the O
to the hizzy.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.655
Yup, yup.

15:58.991 --> 16:01.025
Gross.

16:01.027 --> 16:02.727
Oh, harsh.

That's L to the O

16:04.764 --> 16:05.797
Oh, come on.

What about my clean slate?

16:07.801 --> 16:08.766
WADE:
Ron.

16:08.768 --> 16:10.969
Wade?

16:10.971 --> 16:12.470
How did you find me?

16:12.472 --> 16:14.739
D... did you have me
microchipped or something?

16:14.741 --> 16:16.240
Uh, that's not important now.

16:16.242 --> 16:19.811
Drakken's got Kim at a gator
farm just north of Chez Leisure.

16:19.813 --> 16:20.945
I'm on it, Wade.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.082
Too bad you won't be around

16:24.084 --> 16:26.617
to see me control the minds
of the world's

16:26.619 --> 16:28.186
elderly population.

16:28.188 --> 16:31.089
Which, by the way,
is growing at 10% each year.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.790
Well, mystery signal solved.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.560
Indeed, we had a rough patch
at the get-go,

16:35.562 --> 16:37.662
but I'm quite pleased
with how it's worked out.

16:37.664 --> 16:41.065
The rocket to carry my satellite
into orbit is ready.
