WEBVTT

00:14.633 --> 00:17.600
(Meredith) GREAT SURGEONS
AREN'T MADE, THEY'RE BORN.

00:17.633 --> 00:19.533
IT TAKES GESTATION,

00:19.567 --> 00:22.067
INCUBATION, SACRIFICE--

00:22.100 --> 00:23.267
A LOT OF SACRIFICE.

00:23.300 --> 00:26.167
BUT AFTER ALL THE BLOOD
AND GUTS AND GOOEY STUFF

00:26.200 --> 00:27.833
IS WASHED AWAY,

00:27.867 --> 00:29.833
THAT SURGEON YOU BECOME?
TOTALLY WORTH IT.

00:29.867 --> 00:32.033
(singsongy) WELCOME BACK.

00:32.067 --> 00:35.667
UH, I AM NOT BACK.
I AM HERE FOR A SURGERY.

00:35.700 --> 00:37.433
(normal voice) I KNOW.

00:37.467 --> 00:38.733
UH, CHART, LABS,

00:38.767 --> 00:40.233
UH, SECURITY KEY CARD

00:40.267 --> 00:42.167
AND KEY
TO THE DOCTORS' LOUNGE.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.467
OOH. OH, LOOK.
THEY USED MY OLD PICTURE.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.400
(chuckles) IT'S LIKE
I NEVER LEFT.

00:46.433 --> 00:48.333
ADDIE, YOU'RE BACK.

00:48.367 --> 00:49.567
I AM NOT BACK.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.267
OH, YOU'RE BACK.

00:51.300 --> 00:54.167
YOU'RE GONNA SMELL THE STINK
AND SWEAT OF SURGERY,

00:54.200 --> 00:55.367
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE BACK.

00:55.400 --> 00:58.433
SEE? NOTHING EVER CHANGES
AROUND HERE.
THINGS CHANGE.

00:58.467 --> 00:59.500
WELCOME BACK.

00:59.533 --> 01:01.167
I AM NOT BACK!
(laughs)

01:01.200 --> 01:02.533
(elevator bell dings)

01:02.567 --> 01:04.467
WELL, I JUST HAD NO IDEA

01:04.500 --> 01:06.400
THAT SUNRISE YOGA
WOULD BE SO INTENSE.
TOLD YA.

01:06.433 --> 01:09.267
UM, DR. HAHN, I HAVE
THE 3-D, UH, ULTRASOUNDS

01:09.300 --> 01:11.533
AND THE FETAL M.R.I.s
FOR TODAY'S PATIENT.

01:11.567 --> 01:13.400
HAVE YOU DECIDED WHO'S GONNA
SCRUB IN?

01:13.433 --> 01:15.833
BECAUSE I DIAGNOSED THE MOTHER
WHEN SHE CAME INTO THE CLINIC,

01:15.867 --> 01:17.733
SO--
FILMS.

01:17.767 --> 01:20.300
(elevator bell dings)

01:24.467 --> 01:27.400
MY FIRST DAY. MY CLINICAL TRIAL.
MY BABY, ALL GROWN UP.

01:27.433 --> 01:29.600
YOU KNOW, NOBODY CARES ABOUT
YOUR CLINICAL TRIAL

01:29.633 --> 01:32.167
OR YOUR SICK, SICK,
TERMINAL PATIENTS,

01:32.200 --> 01:34.467
WHO'D PROBABLY RATHER
BE LEFT FOR DEAD.
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS.

01:34.500 --> 01:37.267
WELL, YEAH.
ANYONE CAN COME UP WITH
A CLINICAL TRIAL.

01:37.300 --> 01:40.267
I COULD COME UP
WITH A CLINICAL TRIAL.
(singsongy) JEALOUS.

01:40.300 --> 01:43.067
NOT THAT IT WOULD MATTER, 'CAUSE
HAHN WOULDN'T SIGN OFF ON IT.

01:43.100 --> 01:45.500
YOU KNOW SHE WON'T EVEN
TALK TO ME?
SHE ALWAYS ENJOYED
TALKING TO ME.

01:45.533 --> 01:47.500
REALLY, ABOUT WHAT?
HER HOPES, HER DREAMS, THEN WE
WOULD BRAID EACH OTHER'S HAIR.

01:47.533 --> 01:50.300
WELL, AT LEAST I'M NOT LIVING
IN THE CLINIC.
HEY, I LIKE THE CLINIC.

01:50.333 --> 01:52.667
THE CLINIC IS MY HAPPY PLACE.
WILL YOU USE
YOUR SPARKLE PAGER

01:52.700 --> 01:56.367
TO GET ME IN
ON HAHN'S SURGERY TODAY?
OH, CRISTINA, I CAN'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT THE SPARKLE PAGER

01:56.400 --> 01:58.600
BECAUSE MY CLINICAL TRIAL
STARTS TODAY.
SPARKLE PAGER STEALER!

01:58.633 --> 02:00.567
THANK YOU.
OKAY, THE BOTH OF YOU

02:00.600 --> 02:03.333
NEED TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT
AND DIG DOWN DEEP,

02:03.367 --> 02:06.600
AND YOU'LL DISCOVER WHEN YOU DO
YOU'RE TRULY HAPPY FOR ME

02:06.633 --> 02:08.833
THAT I HAVE FOUND MY PATH
TO MEDICAL HISTORY.

02:08.867 --> 02:10.733
I'M NOT HAPPY FOR ME.
OH, ME NEITHER.

02:10.767 --> 02:12.667
HIS KARNOFSKY SCORE
IS STILL 80,

02:12.700 --> 02:14.467
AND HIS C.B.C.
AND LIVER ENZYMES ARE GOOD.

02:14.500 --> 02:16.400
WELL, THAT'S BETTER
THAN EXPECTED.
I KNOW.

02:16.433 --> 02:18.800
BETTER DOESN'T MEAN GOOD.
I DON'T WANT YOU GETTING

02:18.833 --> 02:21.500
EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED
WITH THESE PATIENTS.

02:21.533 --> 02:23.633
I DON'T WANT YOU GETTING
YOUR HOPES UP.
MY HOPES ARE NOT UP.

02:23.667 --> 02:25.733
ALL RIGHT, THEN, DR. GREY,
LET'S DO THIS.

02:25.767 --> 02:28.433
OKAY.
GOOD. CHART PLEASE.
THANK YOU.

02:28.467 --> 02:29.700
HEY.
OH.

02:29.733 --> 02:30.800
(laughs)

02:30.833 --> 02:32.333
HEY.
HEY.

02:32.367 --> 02:34.467
HEY!
HEY.

02:34.500 --> 02:37.033
COME HERE, YOU.
(laughs)
(laughs)

02:37.067 --> 02:38.400
(laughs)
WOW, IT'S, UH...

02:38.433 --> 02:41.300
WOW, IT'S GREAT
TO SEE YOU GUYS.
HOW'S L.A.?

02:41.333 --> 02:43.467
YEAH, IT IS.
OH, IT'S GREAT.
IT'S FUN.

02:43.500 --> 02:46.333
YOU KNOW, IT'S THE SUN
AND, UH, SURFING. IT'S--
YOU SURF?

02:46.367 --> 02:48.500
NO, I-I DON'T SURF, BUT--

02:48.533 --> 02:49.467
OH.
YOU KNOW?

02:49.500 --> 02:51.500
SO ANYWAY, HEY, LOOK,
I HUGGED YOU THERE.

02:51.533 --> 02:53.433
DID YOU SEE THAT I HUGGED YOU?

02:53.467 --> 02:56.600
YOU STOLE MY HUSBAND FROM ME,
I HUGGED YOU. I--I'VE GROWN.

02:56.633 --> 03:00.433
I HAVE, AND, UH, I CAN BE HAPPY
FOR THE HAPPY COUPLE, RIGHT?

03:00.467 --> 03:03.333
I'M ALL L.A. AND, LIKE--
WHEW--ONE WITH MYSELF.
MM.

03:03.367 --> 03:05.467
SO I FEEL REALLY... YEAH.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.133
HMM.

03:07.167 --> 03:08.367
OKAY.
AH, YEAH.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.300
WELL, I'M GONNA GO
SAVE A LIFE NOW. (laughs)

03:10.333 --> 03:13.033
OKAY.
REALLY, GREAT--
GREAT TO SEE YOU, REALLY.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.300
CHEERS.

03:14.333 --> 03:17.000
HAPPY COUPLE?
SEE YOU AFTER ROUNDS.

03:19.667 --> 03:20.733
HEY.

03:20.767 --> 03:22.267
THERE SHE IS.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.600
JUST COMING IN TO CHECK
ON MY PATIENT'S SKIN FLAP.

03:24.633 --> 03:26.567
YEAH. WELL, AMAZING, RIGHT?
MM.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.467
I PULLED A COUPLE OF STEM CELLS
FROM THE BABY IN UTERO,

03:29.500 --> 03:31.567
SIX WEEKS LATER,
I HAVE GROWN SKIN,

03:31.600 --> 03:33.600
LIKE GOD.

03:33.633 --> 03:35.567
NICE.
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE LOCK THAT DOOR

03:35.600 --> 03:37.767
AND TEAR ONE OFF
FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE?

03:37.800 --> 03:41.767
THIS PLACE
IS EXACTLY THE SAME. YOU
ARE EXACTLY THE SAME.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.133
EXCEPT NOW I GROW SKIN
FOR BABIES...

03:44.167 --> 03:45.467
LIKE GOD.

03:45.500 --> 03:48.200
COME ON. I'M HORNY.
THE NURSES HAVE SHUT ME DOWN.

03:48.233 --> 03:49.333
AWW.

03:49.367 --> 03:51.300
THANKS FOR MY SKIN FLAP.

03:51.333 --> 03:53.233
THAT A EUPHEMISM?

03:53.267 --> 03:54.733
NOPE.

03:54.767 --> 03:56.233
I AM SO CODING.

03:56.267 --> 03:57.633
CODING HARD.

03:57.667 --> 03:59.833
WHAT IS THAT?
IS THAT COMPLAINING?

03:59.867 --> 04:01.800
'CAUSE IF YOU'RE GONNA COMPLAIN,
JUST DO IT TO MY FACE.

04:01.833 --> 04:04.200
FINE. THERE'S NOTHING
TO DO DOWN HERE.

04:04.233 --> 04:06.133
CAN WE PLEASE GO
TO THE PIT OR SOMETHING?

04:06.167 --> 04:08.333
(sighs) YOU'RE DOWN HERE
TO LEARN PATIENT CARE

04:08.367 --> 04:11.033
BEDSIDE MANNER
AND A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS

04:11.067 --> 04:13.167
YOU CANNOT LEARN IN THE PIT,
SO SUCK IT UP.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.533
HI. DR. STEVENS.

04:14.567 --> 04:17.233
WHAT SEEMS TO BE
YOUR PROBLEM TODAY?

04:17.267 --> 04:20.133
WE, UM...
MY WIFE THINKS
SHE MAY BE PREGNANT.

04:20.167 --> 04:22.400
OKAY, UH, WE'LL GET YOU
A TEST--
CODE.

04:22.433 --> 04:24.400
MM. UGH.

04:24.433 --> 04:26.133
EXCUSE ME, WON'T YOU?

04:26.167 --> 04:28.400
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU PEOPLE?

04:28.433 --> 04:30.767
AND WHAT IS THAT SMELL?
IS THAT... (sniffs)

04:30.800 --> 04:32.700
IS THAT SCOTCH?

04:32.733 --> 04:35.600
IT'S SEEPING OUT
OF LEO'S PORES.
YOU'RE HUNGOVER?

04:35.633 --> 04:37.500
YOU'RE ALL HUNGOVER?
DON'T BLAME US.
BLAME O'MALLEY.

04:37.533 --> 04:40.300
GEORGE?
HE AND LEXIE GREY
HAD A PARTY.

04:40.333 --> 04:42.267
GEORGE HAD A PARTY?

04:44.733 --> 04:46.633
OKAY, PEOPLE, YOU'RE ABOUT TO
EXPERIENCE MEDICAL HISTORY,

04:46.667 --> 04:48.400
MEDICAL GREATNESS,
MEDICAL MAJESTY.

04:48.433 --> 04:50.500
YOU'RE ABOUT TO EXPERIENCE

04:50.533 --> 04:52.667
THE BEGINNING
OF SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY.

04:52.700 --> 04:55.333
TAKE IN THE MOMENT.

04:55.367 --> 04:57.500
OKAY, DR. GREY,
DID YOU WARN THE INTERNS

04:57.533 --> 04:59.100
ON WHAT TO EXPECT?

04:59.133 --> 05:01.067
I TOLD THEM
TO EXPECT GREATNESS.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.400
YES, IN ADDITION
TO ALL THE GREATNESS,

05:03.433 --> 05:05.300
THE PATIENT MAY BE
INAPPROPRIATELY EMOTIONAL,

05:05.333 --> 05:07.233
WHICH MEANS HE'S AGGRESSIVE,
UH, ABUSIVE.

05:07.267 --> 05:09.067
DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY,
OKAY? DON'T ENGAGE.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.433
JUST REALIZE
IT'S THE TUMOR TALKING, OKAY?

05:11.467 --> 05:12.767
MR. ROBINSON, MRS. ROBINSON,

05:12.800 --> 05:15.133
DR. GREY AND I WANT TO SAY
ONCE AGAIN

05:15.167 --> 05:17.267
HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE THAT
YOU'VE DECIDED TO PARTICIPATE

05:17.300 --> 05:18.733
IN OUR CLINICAL TRIAL.

05:18.767 --> 05:21.667
I KNOW IT'S
A VERY HARD DECISION TO MAKE.
BUT IT IS A CHANCE, RIGHT?

05:21.700 --> 05:23.400
IT'S, LIKE, OUR ONLY CHANCE?

05:23.433 --> 05:26.300
(laughs) WELL, IF THE SURGERY
DOESN'T KILL ME, THE TUMOR WILL.

05:26.333 --> 05:28.267
WHAT HAVE I GOT
TO LOSE, RIGHT? (laughing)

05:28.300 --> 05:29.367
WELL, AS WE DISCUSSED,

05:29.400 --> 05:31.333
THE TREATMENT HAS NEVER BEEN
TESTED ON HUMANS BEFORE.

05:31.367 --> 05:33.600
WE'RE GOING TO INJECT
A LIVE VIRUS INTO THE TUMOR.

05:33.633 --> 05:35.533
AND SINCE WE CAN'T WE TAKE
THE TUMOR OUT,

05:35.567 --> 05:37.767
OUR HOPE IS TO REDUCE
THE TUMOR FROM WITHIN.

05:37.800 --> 05:39.700
(Meredith) DR. O'MALLEY.
OVER THE PAST MONTH,

05:39.733 --> 05:41.833
MR. ROBINSON HAS EXPERIENCED
WORSENING VISION LOSS

05:41.867 --> 05:43.533
AND INCREASINGLY
SEVERE HEADACHES.

05:43.567 --> 05:45.567
THAT IN C--

05:45.600 --> 05:46.533
YES?

05:46.567 --> 05:47.600
NICE, HUH?

05:47.633 --> 05:50.800
FIRST THING I NOTICED
ABOUT HER--HELL OF AN ASS.

05:50.833 --> 05:52.733
YOU LIKE
A NICE PIECE OF ASS, KID?

05:52.767 --> 05:55.233
ADMITTEDLY, SHE COULD DO
WITH A LITTLE MORE ON TOP.

05:55.267 --> 05:59.433
HE'S ALSO STARTED PICKING OUT
NEW HUSBANDS FOR ME.
WAS ANYONE TALKING TO YOU?!

05:59.467 --> 06:01.533
IT'S THE TUMOR TALKING.

06:01.567 --> 06:04.533
YEAH, IT'S JUST
THE TUMOR TALKING.

06:07.567 --> 06:09.533
SO YOU SINGLE OR WHAT?

06:09.567 --> 06:11.700
(elevator bell dings)

06:11.733 --> 06:13.400
DR. MONTGOMERY.

06:13.433 --> 06:15.267
DR. KAREV.
HEY.

06:15.300 --> 06:17.633
HEY.

06:17.667 --> 06:19.400
WE'RE HUGGING?

06:19.433 --> 06:22.033
YEP. I HUG NOW.
IT'S WHAT I DO, SO...

06:22.067 --> 06:23.533
SO YOU'RE MY GUY, HUH?

06:23.567 --> 06:27.800
YOU THINK I'D LET ANYONE ELSE
IN ON A CASE LIKE THIS?

06:27.833 --> 06:30.167
UH, I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU
IN A SECOND.

06:30.200 --> 06:36.467
OKAY.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.833
YOU, UH, YOU DON'T OWN
A PHONE?

06:38.867 --> 06:41.633
I NEEDED TO SEE YOU
I-IN PERSON.

06:41.667 --> 06:43.567
I HAVE
A REALLY HUGE CASE TODAY.

06:43.600 --> 06:46.033
I WISH I COULD HANG OUT,
I REALLY DO, BUT I--

06:46.067 --> 06:48.567
I'M PREGNANT.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.500
UH...
DIDN'T MEAN TO BLURT IT.

06:50.533 --> 06:52.433
I'M SORRY I BLURTED IT,
BUT I C--

06:52.467 --> 06:54.633
YOU NEVER HAVE TIME TO TALK,

06:54.667 --> 06:56.800
SO I-I KINDA HAD NO CHOICE
BUT TO BLURT.

06:56.833 --> 07:00.300
ARE YOU KEEPING IT
OR ARE YOU HAVING AN ABORTION?

07:01.867 --> 07:05.067
I HAVE A REALLY BIG CASE.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.800
ECTOPIA CORDIS--

07:15.833 --> 07:18.467
THE BABY'S HEART IS GROWING
OUTSIDE OF ITS BODY IN UTERO.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.100
LESS THAN 200 CASES
HAVE EVER BEEN REPORTED.

07:20.133 --> 07:22.100
ONLY A HANDFUL HAVE SURVIVED.

07:22.133 --> 07:24.567
I WAS ON ONE OF THESE CASES
TEN YEARS AGO.

07:24.600 --> 07:27.033
THE BABY SQUEEZED ITS OWN HEART
IN UTERO AND DIED.

07:27.067 --> 07:29.567
HE SQUEEZED HIS OWN HEART
WITH HIS TINY, LITTLE HANDS?

07:29.600 --> 07:31.500
RICHARD, YOU SAID
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY

07:31.533 --> 07:33.433
OF A DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA?

07:33.467 --> 07:35.500
YEAH.

07:35.533 --> 07:39.333
YOU AND I HAVE GOT A LOT OF WORK
TO DO ON THIS LITTLE GUY.

07:39.367 --> 07:42.133
YOU UP FOR IT?
ALWAYS.

07:42.167 --> 07:44.133
WHAT ABOUT MY WORK?

07:44.167 --> 07:46.300
I GREW AN AMAZING FLAP
OF THE BABY'S OWN SKIN.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.400
PRETEND ALL YOU WANT,
BUT I KNOW YOU'RE IMPRESSED.

07:50.733 --> 07:52.100
(women laughing)

07:52.133 --> 07:53.767
YOU ARE GOING TO...
(laughs)

07:53.800 --> 07:55.500
WHAT'S UP, BRO'MALLEY?
YOU.

07:55.533 --> 07:58.400
(man) O'MALLEY'S IN THE HOUSE.

07:58.433 --> 08:01.333
HEY, YOU PAGED ME?

08:01.367 --> 08:04.533
O'MALLEY,
'SUP, PARTY DUDE?

08:04.567 --> 08:07.267
WANT TO KNOW WHAT I DID
LAST NIGHT, GEORGE?

08:07.300 --> 08:10.533
I GOOGLED RECIPES. I SPENT
THE NIGHT WITH A SEARCH ENGINE.

08:10.567 --> 08:14.033
OH, BUT THAT WAS JUST--
IT WAS SO SPONTANEOUS.

08:14.067 --> 08:16.467
I... THINK YOU'D WANT
TO HANG OUT WITH INTERNS.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.267
CODE.
CODE.

08:18.300 --> 08:19.667
(chuckles)
WHAT IS THAT?

08:19.700 --> 08:22.567
OH, IT'S JUST SOMETHING WE
CAME--WELL, HE CAME UP WITH.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.467
HE CODED. (chuckles)

08:24.500 --> 08:26.433
YOU CODED.
(both) CODED.

08:26.467 --> 08:29.133
YOU CODED. IT WAS REALLY FUNNY
AFTER SEVEN OR EIGHT SHOTS.
(Leo) YOU CODED.

08:29.167 --> 08:31.367
HEY. UM, SO WE'RE ALL SET
FOR TONIGHT.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.033
TONIGHT? WHAT'S TONIGHT?

08:33.067 --> 08:36.700
OH! UM...
THE INTERNS, WE'RE--

08:36.733 --> 08:39.700
WE'RE JUST HAVING A LITTLE
DARTS TOURNAMENT THING AT JOE'S.

08:39.733 --> 08:41.633
OH, MY GOD. I LOVE DARTS.
OH, DO YOU WANNA--

08:41.667 --> 08:44.533
DO YOU WANNA COME?
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. YAY.

08:44.567 --> 08:46.000
(chuckles)

08:47.733 --> 08:50.433
YA SO CODED.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.100
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT,
I DON'T KNOW,

08:54.133 --> 08:56.700
THAT IT WOULD BE WEIRD
COMING BACK,

08:56.733 --> 08:59.600
BUT I GOTTA SAY, I FIND IT
STRANGELY COMFORTING

08:59.633 --> 09:02.200
THAT EVERYTHING
IS THE SAME HERE.

09:02.233 --> 09:05.533
OKAY, IN L.A.,
PEOPLE SAY THINGS,

09:05.567 --> 09:08.433
BUT IN SEATTLE, THERE'S THIS
STRANGE CULTURE OF WORDLESSNESS

09:08.467 --> 09:11.533
WHEREIN I AM SUPPOSED TO SUSS
WHAT ONE IS FEELING

09:11.567 --> 09:15.200
BY THE SLIGHT RAISE
OF AN EYEBROW

09:15.233 --> 09:17.800
OR THE BEGINNINGS OF A FROWN.

09:17.833 --> 09:19.733
THERE ANY CHANCE
YOU WANT TO TELL ME

09:19.767 --> 09:21.800
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU,
MIRANDA?

09:21.833 --> 09:24.133
JUST... JUST A LOT
HAS CHANGED SINCE YOU LEFT.

09:24.167 --> 09:26.033
JUST A LOT.
OH, COME ON.

09:26.067 --> 09:27.800
NAME ONE THING THAT HAS
CHANGED IN THIS HOSPITAL.

09:27.833 --> 09:30.400
THE CLINIC IS ACTUALLY
MAKING MONEY.

09:30.433 --> 09:32.033
THE CHIEF'S WIFE LEFT HIM.
MM-HMM.

09:32.067 --> 09:34.500
DEREK AND MEREDITH
BROKE UP AND I--

09:34.533 --> 09:38.400
WHOA, WHOA. J--
DEREK AND MEREDITH BROKE UP?

09:38.433 --> 09:41.567
UH, LIKE I SAID,
A LOT OF THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

09:44.100 --> 09:45.833
NIKKI JONES,
25-YEAR-OLD FEMALE,

09:45.867 --> 09:46.967
35 WEEKS PREGNANT.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.167
SIX WEEKS AGO, SHE WAS
DIAGNOSED WITH ECTOPIA CORDIS.

09:49.200 --> 09:52.067
(Erica) WHICH, AS YOU KNOW,
MEANS THAT YOUR BABY'S HEART

09:52.100 --> 09:54.433
IS CURRENTLY GROWING ON
THE OUTSIDE OF HIS BODY.

09:54.467 --> 09:56.367
WHICH DOESN'T GET
ANY LESS BIZARRE

09:56.400 --> 09:58.300
THE MORE TIMES I HEAR IT.

09:58.333 --> 10:00.300
NOT BIZARRE, BABY.
JUST UNIQUE.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.300
OUR SON IS ONE OF A KIND--

10:02.333 --> 10:04.267
WEARING HIS HEART
ON HIS SLEEVE.

10:04.300 --> 10:07.733
THIS SURGERY IS GOING TO
TAKE PLACE IN TWO O.R.s.

10:07.767 --> 10:09.733
IT'LL--IT WILL WORK
LIKE A DANCE.

10:09.767 --> 10:14.133
DR. KAREV AND I
WILL BEGIN WITH THE DELIVERY.
AND I'LL STAY BEHIND TO CLOSE
YOUR INCISION, NIKKI.

10:14.167 --> 10:16.067
WHILE I BRING YOUR BABY
TO O.R. TWO.

10:16.100 --> 10:17.833
WHERE I'LL WORK
ON YOUR BABY'S HEART.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.700
AND I'LL ATTEND TO YOUR BABY'S
INTESTINAL PROBLEM.

10:20.733 --> 10:23.500
WHAT INTESTINAL PROBLEM?
WE'VE DETECTED
THERE MIGHT BE

10:23.533 --> 10:26.100
A SLIGHT DEFECT
ON YOUR BABY'S DIAPHRAGM.

10:26.133 --> 10:28.533
WE JUST WANT TO BE PREPARED
FOR EVERY CONTINGENCY.

10:28.567 --> 10:31.233
I JUST WISH
I COULD KEEP HIM INSIDE ME,

10:31.267 --> 10:33.033
KEEP HIM PROTECTED.

10:33.067 --> 10:36.567
(man) HE'S PROTECTED
NO MATTER WHAT, BY US,

10:36.600 --> 10:38.267
BY OUR LOVE.

10:39.800 --> 10:42.833
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT GUY MAKES
ME JUST WANT TO PUNCH HIM OUT.

10:42.867 --> 10:46.433
AND YET YOU DIDN'T, FOR WHICH
I AM GRATEFUL, KAREV.

10:46.467 --> 10:48.500
(chuckles)
HIPPIES...

10:48.533 --> 10:51.267
ANNOYING, HUH?

10:51.300 --> 10:54.767
GO AWAY.

10:54.800 --> 10:57.700
HEY. HOW GREAT IS SHE?
SHE'S GREAT.

10:57.733 --> 10:59.133
DID I TELL YOU?
YOU TOLD ME.

10:59.167 --> 11:01.133
DID SHE TELL YOU?
TELL ME WHAT?

11:01.167 --> 11:03.067
ANYTHING, EVERYTHING.
(laughs)

11:03.100 --> 11:05.300
DOES SHE KNOW
YOU'RE DIVORCED?

11:05.333 --> 11:06.533
YOU'RE DIVORCED?
YEAH.

11:06.567 --> 11:08.233
WHICH, AS IT TURNS OUT...

11:08.267 --> 11:11.167
WAS THE BEST THING THAT COULD'VE
HAPPENED, REALLY. (laughs)

11:11.200 --> 11:13.300
NO KIDDING?
ARE YOU HEADED--

11:13.333 --> 11:15.233
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL WALK WITH YOU.

11:15.267 --> 11:17.300
(laughs) OKAY.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.267
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
YOU KNOW...
(laughs)

11:19.300 --> 11:21.767
SO IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S BEEN
A LOT OF CHANGE,

11:21.800 --> 11:23.700
EVEN SINCE THE LAST CHECKUP.

11:23.733 --> 11:25.633
HIS BEHAVIOR'S BEEN GETTING
MORE ERRATIC?

11:25.667 --> 11:27.567
THAT'S A NICE WAY
OF PUTTING IT.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.400
WELL, YOU'VE BEEN
INCREDIBLY STRONG, JENNIFER.

11:29.433 --> 11:31.667
THIS IS...
YOU'VE BEEN INCREDIBLY STRONG.

11:31.700 --> 11:33.333
(blows raspberry)

11:33.367 --> 11:36.167
YOU KNOW, IF YOU REALLY
WANT TO HELP, DR. GREY,

11:36.200 --> 11:38.100
YOU COULD BRING
SOME SINGLE MEN BY.

11:38.133 --> 11:39.333
PHILLIP...

11:39.367 --> 11:41.333
PLEASE STOP.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.267
JENNIFER,
WE'RE IN A HOSPITAL

11:43.300 --> 11:44.767
FULL OF ELIGIBLE DOCTORS,

11:44.800 --> 11:47.300
AND YOU'RE A WAITRESS
WITH NO PROSPECTS

11:47.333 --> 11:50.200
WHO NEEDS TO LEARN HOW TO
USE HER ASS TO CATCH A NEW GUY

11:50.233 --> 11:53.333
BEFORE I BITE THE DUST!

11:53.367 --> 11:56.567
IT'S JUST THE TUMOR TALKING.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.567
IT'S JUST THE TUMOR TALKING.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.667
IT IS.
IT'S JUST THE TUMOR TALKING.

12:01.700 --> 12:05.533
(laughing)

12:05.567 --> 12:07.800
AND HE'S LAUGHING AGAIN,

12:07.833 --> 12:09.733
BECAUSE THE IDEA OF ME
WITH ANOTHER MAN

12:09.767 --> 12:11.567
IS JUST HILARIOUS.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.767
NO, NO, IT'S NOT.
I-I JUST CAN'T SEE.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.567
WHAT? WHAT CAN'T YOU SEE?

12:16.600 --> 12:20.300
I-I--ANYTHING.
(laughs) I'M BLIND.

12:20.333 --> 12:23.667
(laughing)

12:31.367 --> 12:33.767
NO RESPONSE TO LIGHT.

12:33.800 --> 12:37.233
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY, YOU'RE
A GOOD-LOOKING GUY, RIGHT?

12:37.267 --> 12:40.300
YOU KNOW, JUST 'CAUSE I'M BLIND
DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN IGNORE ME,

12:40.333 --> 12:43.100
YOU SICK, TWISTED BASTARD!

12:43.133 --> 12:45.400
PLAYING GAMES
WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES,

12:45.433 --> 12:48.033
SLICING OPEN PEOPLE'S BRAINS...

12:48.067 --> 12:49.833
MR. ROBINSON, I'M...

12:49.867 --> 12:52.200
I'M SORRY,
BUT I BELIEVE IT'S POSSIBLE

12:52.233 --> 12:54.733
THE TUMOR IS INFILTRATING
THE OPTIC NERVE.

12:54.767 --> 12:56.800
WE SHOULD CONSIDER
MOVING THE SURGERY,

12:56.833 --> 12:58.733
MAYBE EVEN DOING IT TODAY.

12:58.767 --> 13:01.767
(Phillip laughs)

13:01.800 --> 13:03.700
WHAT ABOUT YOU, DR. GREY?

13:03.733 --> 13:06.333
YOU'RE A SEXY LITTLE THING.

13:06.367 --> 13:08.800
YOU THINK,
UH, DR. SHEPHERD HERE

13:08.833 --> 13:11.700
IS ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH
FOR MY WIFE?

13:11.733 --> 13:13.100
HMM?

13:14.833 --> 13:16.167
(Phillip laughs)

13:18.833 --> 13:21.533
JENNIFER...
THIS ISN'T EASY, I KNOW.

13:21.567 --> 13:24.567
MY HUSBAND IS PROBABLY
GONNA DIE TODAY.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.267
WE'RE MOVING UP THE SURGERY,
AND HE MIGHT DIE,

13:27.300 --> 13:30.267
AND ALL HE CAN DO IS TRY
TO FIX ME UP WITH OTHER MEN.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.833
AND I KNOW, I KNOW
IT'S THE TUMOR TALKING,

13:32.867 --> 13:35.267
BUT IF HE DIES,
MY LAST MEMORY

13:35.300 --> 13:39.200
IS GOING TO BE OF HIM
CALLING ME A PIECE OF ASS.

13:42.567 --> 13:44.733
I'M NOT INVOLVED
AND MY HOPES ARE NOT UP.

13:44.767 --> 13:47.333
MM-HMM.

13:47.367 --> 13:50.233
I'M HAVING TROUBLE FINDING
A HEARTBEAT ON AN ULTRASOUND.

13:50.267 --> 13:52.167
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS,
DR. GUZMAN,

13:52.200 --> 13:54.100
WHEN YOU'VE HAD SCOTCH
FOR DINNER.

13:54.133 --> 13:56.267
IT'S HARD TO FOLLOW
THE BASICS.

13:57.833 --> 13:59.767
OH, REBECCA.

13:59.800 --> 14:01.633
HI.

14:01.667 --> 14:03.567
UM, I REALLY DIDN'T WANT
AN ULTRASOUND.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.733
I JUST WANTED TO GET SOMETHING
FOR THE MORNING SICKNESS.

14:05.767 --> 14:07.533
IT'S REALLY BAD.

14:07.567 --> 14:08.733
SO YOU'RE PREGNANT?

14:08.767 --> 14:10.833
YEAH. JUST LIKE
FIVE WEEKS OR SO.

14:10.867 --> 14:12.500
UH, YEAH, AN ULTRASOUND

14:12.533 --> 14:15.300
CAN BE PRETTY HARD TO READ
THIS EARLY ON,

14:15.333 --> 14:16.833
SO LET'S JUST TAKE
A BLOOD SAMPLE,

14:16.867 --> 14:19.400
AND, UH, MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING'S ON TRACK.
OKAY. DR. STEVENS...

14:19.433 --> 14:22.167
DO YOU KNOW WHEN DR. KAREV
WILL BE OUT OF SURGERY?

14:22.200 --> 14:24.067
I JUST WANTED TO SAY HI.

14:24.100 --> 14:28.133
UM, I, UH, I-I DON'T KNOW
THAT HE'S GONE IN YET.

14:28.167 --> 14:30.567
YOU BROKE UP
WITH MEREDITH GREY?

14:30.600 --> 14:32.500
WELL, WE'RE DOING
A CLINICAL TRIAL TOGETHER

14:32.533 --> 14:34.067
IF THAT MAKES YOU
FEEL BETTER.

14:34.100 --> 14:36.500
DEREK, I HUGGED HER--
HUGGED HER--

14:36.533 --> 14:39.167
AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN
TOGETHER WITH HER ANYMORE?

14:39.200 --> 14:40.467
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

14:40.500 --> 14:43.300
OKAY, FINE. TELL ME ABOUT
THE CLINICAL TRIAL.

14:43.333 --> 14:46.200
WELL, IF IT DOESN'T GO WELL,
I'M KILLING PEOPLE FOR SPORT.

14:46.233 --> 14:48.133
WHEN I WALK INTO AN O.R.,
I'M AN EXPERT.

14:48.167 --> 14:50.800
I CAN STOP A BLEED, I CAN
REMOVE A CLOT. I'M THE EXPERT.

14:50.833 --> 14:54.167
BUT IN A CLINICAL TRIAL...
I'M EXPERIMENTING,

14:54.200 --> 14:57.367
JUST GROPING AROUND
IN THE DARK,

14:57.400 --> 14:59.300
HOPING TO DO
THE RIGHT THING.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.567
SHE WANTS GREATNESS FROM ME.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.500
SHE'S EXPECTING GREATNESS.

15:03.533 --> 15:07.300
OKAY, SERIOUSLY, DEREK,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:07.333 --> 15:10.100
I'M SEEING SOMEBODY ELSE.

15:11.333 --> 15:13.667
SHE'S LOVELY.

15:13.700 --> 15:15.600
SHE'S REALLY LOVELY.

15:16.833 --> 15:20.433
HEY. YOU CAME.
YEAH. Y-YOU HAVE TO
STOP PAGING ME.

15:20.467 --> 15:22.800
I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS
RIGHT NOW. ALL RIGHT?

15:22.833 --> 15:26.433
I HAVE A REALLY BIG CASE TODAY
AND I JUST CAN'T DEAL WITH--
I AM JUST AS SCARED

15:26.467 --> 15:29.333
AND CONFUSED ABOUT THIS
AS YOU ARE.
I'M NOT SCARED. I'M JUST...

15:29.367 --> 15:31.333
LOOK,
Y-YOU DON'T WANT ME, OKAY?

15:31.367 --> 15:33.667
THIS--THIS IS NOT A THING
YOU WANT ME FOR.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.567
I WON'T BE GOOD AT IT.
I--I'M--I'M NOT FATHER MATERIAL.

15:36.600 --> 15:38.500
I MEAN... YOU HAVE A HUSBAND.

15:38.533 --> 15:41.233
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO KNOW
THAT IT'S MINE, OKAY?

15:41.267 --> 15:42.667
NO. NO, IT'S NOT OKAY.

15:42.700 --> 15:45.400
ALEX, I'M JUST ASKING YOU
TO GET OVER YOURSELF

15:45.433 --> 15:47.367
FOR ONE MINUTE
AND TALK TO ME

15:47.400 --> 15:49.333
SO WE CAN
FIGURE THIS THING OUT...

15:49.367 --> 15:50.633
TOGETHER.

15:50.667 --> 15:53.633
I HAVE TO GO.

15:56.500 --> 15:59.067
(door closes)

15:59.100 --> 16:01.267
I'M GONNA BE MAKING THE INCISION
FROM HERE TO HERE, AND--

16:01.300 --> 16:04.200
EXCUSE ME. WHAT YOU SAID BEFORE
ABOUT FURTHER COMPLICATIONS--

16:04.233 --> 16:06.100
NO, WE CAN'T THINK
LIKE THAT.

16:06.133 --> 16:09.333
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
WRONG WITH HIM.

16:09.367 --> 16:11.633
OUR INTENTION IS TO HAVE
A HEALTHY BABY.

16:11.667 --> 16:14.200
HE'LL BE STRONG AND HAPPY
AND HEALTHY.

16:14.233 --> 16:16.400
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT
WE'RE TRYING TO TELL YOU?

16:16.433 --> 16:19.433
I MEAN, CHANCES ARE YOUR BABY'S
GONNA NEED A HELL OF A LOT MORE

16:19.467 --> 16:22.033
THAN JUST HEART SURGERY.
DR. KAREV.

16:22.067 --> 16:24.267
CHANCES ARE HE WON'T.
YOU CAN'T CROSS YOUR FINGERS
OR CLOSE YOUR EYES

16:24.300 --> 16:26.833
AND HOPE
THIS WILL ALL GO AWAY.
DR. KAREV.

16:26.867 --> 16:29.200
HE'S NOT PREPARED.
I WAS TRYING TO PREPARE HIM.

16:29.233 --> 16:32.367
THEY'RE HAVING A BABY, AND THAT
BABY IS GONNA BE ALL SCREWED UP

16:32.400 --> 16:34.800
BECAUSE HE'S COMING INTO
A WORLD

16:34.833 --> 16:36.433
WHERE HIS PARENTS
ARE UNPREPARED.

16:36.467 --> 16:38.533
THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT
LOVING EACH OTHER, AS IF--

16:38.567 --> 16:41.100
AS IF THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO
WITH HAVING THE ABILITY

16:41.133 --> 16:43.033
TO RAISE A BABY--
A SICK BABY.

16:43.067 --> 16:44.800
HE'S NOT PREPARED.
I WAS TRYING TO PREPARE HIM.

16:44.833 --> 16:47.033
KAREV,
RIGHT NOW YOU'RE FEELING

16:47.067 --> 16:49.200
ALL YOUR FEELINGS
RIGHT OUT IN THE OPEN.

16:49.233 --> 16:52.133
DO ME A FAVOR
AND STUFF THEM BACK IN.

16:56.533 --> 16:58.433
INTERESTING ADVICE.

16:58.467 --> 17:00.467
DON'T START WITH ME.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.367
(laughs)

17:04.400 --> 17:06.233
SHE'S NO LONGER ALLOWED
IN MY APARTMENT,

17:06.267 --> 17:08.767
SO NO MORE TEA PARTIES
OR WINE PARTIES

17:08.800 --> 17:11.233
OR WHATEVER YOU TWO HAVE.
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

17:11.267 --> 17:14.033
HAHN. SHE'S COMPLETELY UNFAIR
AND SHE REFUSES TO TEACH ME.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.567
OKAY, I GOT IN AT MASS GEN,
I GOT IN AT JOHNS HOPKINS.

17:16.600 --> 17:19.733
I COULD HAVE GONE ANYWHERE,
AND SHE WON'T TEACH ME!
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, ERICA--
SHE'S A REALLY GOOD LISTENER.

17:19.767 --> 17:22.667
SHE'S--SHE COMES OFF HARSH
AT FIRST...

17:22.700 --> 17:25.667
UH-HUH.
BUT SHE'S GOT
A REALLY GOOD HEART.

17:25.700 --> 17:28.367
SO JUST TELL HER
HOW YOU FEEL, OKAY?

17:28.400 --> 17:31.467
(clears throat)
(Cristina)
TELL HER HOW I FEEL?

17:31.500 --> 17:34.267
WELL, I DON'T SPEAK GIRL.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.267
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

17:37.300 --> 17:40.567
DID I MENTION
I LIVE WITH YANG NOW?

17:40.600 --> 17:42.067
WHAT?

17:42.100 --> 17:43.833
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME
LIKE THAT?

17:43.867 --> 17:45.533
CALLIE...
MM-HMM.

17:45.567 --> 17:48.533
ARE YOU SPEAKING THE...
VAGINA MONOLOGUES NOW?

17:48.567 --> 17:51.467
WHAT? (laughs)

17:51.500 --> 17:54.067
I'M ALL FOR IT, OKAY?
I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC.

17:54.100 --> 17:56.167
ERICA--
I MEAN, SHE SEEMS GREAT.

17:56.200 --> 17:59.033
I REALLY DO LIKE HER, ACTUALLY.
I DO, AND--BUT ARE YOU?

17:59.067 --> 18:00.567
(laughs) YOU WANT TO KNOW

18:00.600 --> 18:02.500
IF ERICA AND I
ARE A-A-A COUPLE?

18:02.533 --> 18:05.033
BECAUSE I DEFENDED HER
TO YANG?

18:05.067 --> 18:07.767
BECAUSE YOU SEEM LIKE A COUPLE,
A REALLY HAPPY COUPLE.

18:07.800 --> 18:11.333
UM, UM... (laughing)
OKAY, THAT'S...

18:11.367 --> 18:12.733
THAT'S--THAT'S JUST...

18:12.767 --> 18:15.533
THAT'S--THAT'S INSANE
IS--IS--IS WHAT IT IS.

18:15.567 --> 18:17.467
I'M--I-I-I LIKE PENIS.

18:17.500 --> 18:20.267
I MEAN, I'M A HUGE,
HUGE FAN OF PENIS.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.300
(laughs) HA! HILARIOUS.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.400
YOU'VE BEEN LIVING
IN LOS ANGELES WAY TOO LONG.

18:23.433 --> 18:25.567
(laughs) WAY TOO LONG.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.100
HA! HA! HILARI--

18:27.133 --> 18:29.033
***

18:29.067 --> 18:30.167
GEORGE.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.067
GEORGE. GEORGE.

18:32.100 --> 18:34.400
HEY, LISTEN...

18:34.433 --> 18:37.700
I AM JUST THE MESSENGER,
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT PEOPLE

18:37.733 --> 18:40.500
ARE PREPARED TO DROP OUT
OF THE TOURNAMENT TONIGHT.

18:40.533 --> 18:44.100
NOBODY WANTS TO GET DRUNK
AND PLAY DARTS WITH THEIR BOSS.

18:44.133 --> 18:47.067
YOU WANT ME TO TAKE BACK
THE INVITATION?
I'M JUST THE MESSENGER.

18:47.100 --> 18:48.100
Y--

18:48.133 --> 18:50.033
***

18:50.067 --> 18:52.233
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

18:52.267 --> 18:54.600
MORE SPECIAL PLANS
WITH YOUR SPECIAL FRIENDS?

18:54.633 --> 18:57.267
(Cristina) I WOULD LIKE US
TO TALK TODAY.

18:57.300 --> 19:00.500
I WOULD LIKE US TO TALK
BECAUSE... I CARE

19:00.533 --> 19:03.500
AND I, UH,
WANT TO KNOW THINGS

19:03.533 --> 19:06.267
AND I-I-I HAVE 15 MINUTES
TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS.

19:06.300 --> 19:08.100
SO... (clears throat)
ALEX...

19:08.133 --> 19:10.700
ALEX, YOU LOOK THOUGHTFUL.

19:10.733 --> 19:12.100
I'M VERY INTERESTED TO HEAR--

19:12.133 --> 19:14.133
I MEAN, UH,
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

19:14.167 --> 19:15.700
(slurps)

19:15.733 --> 19:18.800
NO. UH, IZZIE, UH,
YOUR THOUGHTS, YOUR FEELINGS?

19:18.833 --> 19:20.533
HONESTLY?
UH-HUH.

19:20.567 --> 19:22.300
I'M A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT
MY FRIEND ALEX HERE

19:22.333 --> 19:24.467
BECAUSE HIS JANE DOE GIRLFRIEND
KEEPS SHOWING UP

19:24.500 --> 19:27.367
LIKE SOMETHING
OUT OF "FATAL ATTRACTION."
HER NAME IS REBECCA POPE,

19:27.400 --> 19:30.400
AND SHE'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.
REALLY?

19:30.433 --> 19:32.500
YOU GUYS HAVEN'T... HAD SEX...
(slurping)

19:32.533 --> 19:35.733
AT ALL RECENTLY?
SHE'S MARRIED, OKAY?
SHE HAS A HUSBAND.

19:35.767 --> 19:38.633
WELL, DOES IT HURT THAT Y--
SHE'S MARRIED?
(slurping)

19:38.667 --> 19:40.767
I MEAN, DOES THAT HURT YOUR--
YOUR HEART?
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

19:40.800 --> 19:42.533
I'M TRYING TO TALK GIRL.

19:42.567 --> 19:44.500
WELL... YA CODED.

19:44.533 --> 19:46.367
(laughs) RIGHT?

19:46.400 --> 19:47.600
(Izzie laughs)

19:47.633 --> 19:51.267
WHAT? IT'S A NEW SLANG.
EVERYBODY'S SAYING IT.

19:51.300 --> 19:53.200
(laughing)
THE WAY YOU JUST SAID THAT,

19:53.233 --> 19:55.200
THAT WAS YOU CODING.

19:55.233 --> 19:57.333
(laughing)

19:57.367 --> 19:59.100
WHATEVER.

19:59.133 --> 20:02.300
UNLIKE MEREDITH WITH HER TRIALS
AND PETRI DISHES, AND CRISTINA,

20:02.333 --> 20:04.200
WHO HAS TO PRACTICE
TALKING LIKE A HUMAN BEING...

20:04.233 --> 20:07.467
(slams table) I ACTUALLY CARE
ABOUT PATIENT CARE.

20:07.500 --> 20:10.500
I NEED THE SPARKLE PAGER.
SHE'S NOT GIVING YOU
THE SPARKLE PAGER.

20:10.533 --> 20:12.433
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I CAN'T TALK GIRL.

20:12.467 --> 20:14.367
AND I SHOULDN'T
HAVE TO TALK GIRL

20:14.400 --> 20:16.100
'CAUSE I DIAGNOSED THE PATIENT.
I NEED THE PAGER.

20:16.133 --> 20:19.367
(clenched teeth) YOU CAN'T HAVE
THE SPARKLE PAGER.
NO, GIVE IT TO ME.
GIVE IT TO ME.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.133
(clears throat) UM...

20:21.167 --> 20:24.167
ANYONE, UH, ANYONE EVER THINK
YOU TWO WERE A-A COUPLE?

20:24.200 --> 20:27.033
NO, BECAUSE WE SCREW BOYS
LIKE WHORES ON TEQUILA.

20:27.067 --> 20:29.533
AND THEN WE EITHER TRY TO
MARRY THEM OR DROWN OURSELVES.
HUH.

20:29.567 --> 20:31.133
(slurps)

20:31.167 --> 20:33.700
WELL, UM, MAKE HAHN
LET ME SCRUB IN,

20:33.733 --> 20:35.633
OR I'M MAKING YOU MOVE OUT.

20:35.667 --> 20:37.133
WHAT? YOU--

20:37.167 --> 20:38.600
DESPERATE TIMES.

20:38.633 --> 20:41.400
I'M SORRY THAT TOOK SO LONG.

20:41.433 --> 20:44.300
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU'RE PREGNANT.

20:44.333 --> 20:47.800
YOU'RE SURE?
IT'S A BIG DAY
FOR PREGNANT LADIES.

20:47.833 --> 20:50.133
PREGNANT LADIES EVERYWHERE
I TURN. IT'S WEIRD.

20:50.167 --> 20:52.700
SO I'M ONLY SUPPOSED TO
GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF THESE,

20:52.733 --> 20:54.833
BUT THIS IS, LIKE, A MONTH'S
SUPPLY OF PRENATAL VITAMINS--

20:54.867 --> 20:56.533
SAMPLES, THEY'RE FREE.

20:56.567 --> 20:59.633
NO, I... WE NEED
TO SCHEDULE AN ABORTION.

20:59.667 --> 21:01.200
O-OKAY.

21:01.233 --> 21:03.667
(Izzie)
UH, I'M SORRY. I...

21:03.700 --> 21:07.567
I'M SORRY.
I'M SO SORRY.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.233
I-I DON'T MEAN TO INTRUDE,

21:10.267 --> 21:13.300
BUT... YOU MIGHT WANT TO
SIT WITH THIS FOR A FEW DAYS

21:13.333 --> 21:15.233
BEFORE YOU MAKE YOUR DECISION.

21:15.267 --> 21:17.533
THERE'S NO DECISION TO MAKE.

21:17.567 --> 21:20.067
I'M H.I.V. POSITIVE,

21:20.100 --> 21:23.467
AND THE CONDOM BROKE.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.400
OH, I-I GOT TESTED ALREADY,

21:25.433 --> 21:27.567
AND, UM, I WILL AGAIN S--
IN, UM, SIX MONTHS,

21:27.600 --> 21:29.800
BUT, UH, SO FAR I'M FINE.

21:29.833 --> 21:32.200
SO...

21:32.233 --> 21:35.100
PLEASE I JUST--I-I...
I WANT TO GET THIS OVER WITH.

21:35.133 --> 21:38.333
IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT WE CAN
TAKE CARE OF IT TODAY?

21:38.367 --> 21:40.700
YEAH. LET ME, UH...

21:40.733 --> 21:43.433
LET ME SEE
WHAT I CAN SET UP.

21:43.467 --> 21:45.333
THANK YOU.

21:45.367 --> 21:46.600
(sobs)

21:53.533 --> 21:54.367
HERE.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.333
ALL RIGHT.

21:55.367 --> 21:56.267
TORRES.

21:56.300 --> 21:58.467
HEY. UH, DO ME A--
DO ME A--DO ME A FAVOR

21:58.500 --> 22:00.800
AND, UH, PUT YANG
ON YOUR SURGERY.

22:00.833 --> 22:03.300
ONLY IF YOU BUY DRINKS
AT JOE'S TONIGHT.

22:03.333 --> 22:04.367
DONE.

22:04.400 --> 22:06.300
(chuckles)

22:08.133 --> 22:11.133
(crunching)

22:18.667 --> 22:21.467
DR. MONTGOMERY,
WILL YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

22:21.500 --> 22:25.033
CAN YOU TALK TO MY PATIENT?
I DON'T WORK HERE
ANYMORE, STEVENS.

22:25.067 --> 22:26.367
SHE'S PREGNANT
AND H.I.V. POSITIVE,

22:26.400 --> 22:29.200
AND SHE THINKS SHE HAS TO
TERMINATE THE PREGNANCY.
SHE DOESN'T.

22:29.233 --> 22:30.767
(mouth full)
I KNOW, BUT SHE DOESN'T,

22:30.800 --> 22:33.267
AND IT'S NOT MY AREA
OF EXPERTISE.
I DON'T WORK HERE
ANYMORE, STEVENS.

22:33.300 --> 22:35.467
IF I WORKED HERE,
I WOULD BE PERFORMING

22:35.500 --> 22:37.333
SURGERY AFTER SURGERY
AFTER SURGERY.

22:37.367 --> 22:39.333
I MIGHT EVEN BE BACK
WITH, UH, MY HUSBAND,

22:39.367 --> 22:41.600
WHO IS APPARENTLY ON THE MARKET,
AND I'M NOT SAYING

22:41.633 --> 22:43.533
THAT I WANT TO GET BACK
WITH MY HUSBAND.

22:43.567 --> 22:45.467
IT'S JUST THAT THINGS
WERE SIMPLER WITH HIM

22:45.500 --> 22:48.433
THAN THE MESSY, MESSY SINGLE
LIFE I AM CURRENTLY LIVING,

22:48.467 --> 22:51.167
WHICH WAS NOT MY POINT,
BY THE WAY.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.267
MY POINT WAS...
THAT I NO LONGER WORK HERE,

22:53.300 --> 22:55.767
WHICH MEANS YOU NEED
TO PULL YOUR FACE

22:55.800 --> 22:56.967
OUT OF THE POTATO CHIP TROUGH

22:57.000 --> 22:59.567
AND GO TEND
TO YOUR PATIENTS YOURSELF.
I KNOW, BUT--

22:59.600 --> 23:02.300
YOU'RE A FIGHTER, STEVENS.
WHAT HAPPENED?

23:02.333 --> 23:04.300
(normal voice)
I LOST A LOT OF FIGHTS.

23:04.333 --> 23:06.233
WELL, TIME TO GET BACK UP.

23:06.267 --> 23:07.533
GO.

23:07.567 --> 23:11.567
BE THE CHANGE
YOU WANT TO SEE IN THE WORLD.

23:13.400 --> 23:15.467
DID YOU JUST QUOTE GANDHI
TO ME?

23:15.500 --> 23:18.233
IT'S, UH, TIME
TO TAKE HER TO THE O.R.

23:18.267 --> 23:21.267
I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

23:21.300 --> 23:22.767
WE HEARD YOU.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.433
IT COULD BE BAD,

23:24.467 --> 23:27.467
AND THERE'S ALWAYS
A WHOLE LOT OF BAD TO FOCUS ON

23:27.500 --> 23:30.467
IF YOU WANT TO.

23:30.500 --> 23:32.500
BUT THERE'S HOPE, TOO, RIGHT?

23:32.533 --> 23:35.600
THERE'S ALWAYS HOPE, TOO.

23:39.300 --> 23:40.367
JENNIFER?

23:40.400 --> 23:42.300
NO, IT'S DR. SHEPHERD.

23:42.333 --> 23:44.167
I HATE THIS...

23:44.200 --> 23:46.833
NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE.

23:46.867 --> 23:48.700
I JUST WANT TO SEE JENNIFER.

23:48.733 --> 23:52.367
PHILLIP, THIS IS
AN EXTREMELY RISKY OPERATION.

23:52.400 --> 23:54.667
YOU STILL MAY HAVE
A FEW WEEKS TO LIVE.

23:54.700 --> 23:57.667
YOU COULD SPEND THAT TIME
WITH JENNIFER.

23:57.700 --> 24:00.100
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO
THIS SURGERY TODAY.

24:00.133 --> 24:02.233
(chuckles)

24:02.267 --> 24:04.600
I'M TRYING
TO FIX JENNIFER UP.

24:04.633 --> 24:07.067
I DON'T WANT
TO LEAVE HER ALONE.

24:07.100 --> 24:10.833
IT'S THE ONE THING ABOUT
ALL THIS I REALLY CAN'T STAND.

24:10.867 --> 24:15.233
I JUST WANT HER
TO BE ALL RIGHT WHEN I'M GONE.

24:15.267 --> 24:17.167
YOU NEED TO TELL HER THAT.

24:17.200 --> 24:19.100
BEFORE YOU GO INTO SURGERY,

24:19.133 --> 24:21.433
YOU NEED TO REMEMBER
THIS CONVERSATION,

24:21.467 --> 24:24.500
AND YOU NEED
TO TELL HER THAT.

24:29.333 --> 24:30.800
HEY.

24:30.833 --> 24:33.533
I ONLY HAVE FIVE MINUTES
BECAUSE WE MOVED A SURGERY UP.

24:33.567 --> 24:35.467
BUT I DID WANT TO COME HERE
AND SAY

24:35.500 --> 24:37.400
THAT OBVIOUSLY,
HE DOESN'T KNOW ME AT ALL.

24:37.433 --> 24:38.833
I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO'S EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED.

24:38.867 --> 24:40.767
HE'S THE ONE
WHO'S EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED.

24:40.800 --> 24:42.233
"HE"?

24:42.267 --> 24:44.567
DEREK--TOLD ME
NOT TO GET MY HOPES UP.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.100
ANYBODY WHO KNOWS ME

24:46.133 --> 24:48.167
KNOWS I'M NOT A HOPEFUL PERSON
TO BEGIN WITH.

24:48.200 --> 24:49.267
RIGHT.

24:49.300 --> 24:52.233
I CAME UP WITH THIS
CLINICAL TRIAL. IT'S MY BABY.

24:52.267 --> 24:55.133
DOES HE HONESTLY THINK THAT
I'VE JUST WALKED INTO THIS THING

24:55.167 --> 24:57.833
WITH NO UNDERSTANDING
OF HOW HARD IT WILL BE?

24:57.867 --> 25:00.067
SERIOUSLY. NO WONDER
WE DIDN'T WORK OUT.

25:00.100 --> 25:02.267
BECAUSE HE TOLD YOU
NOT TO GET YOUR HOPES UP.

25:02.300 --> 25:04.467
EXACTLY. I GOTTA GO.
SURGERY'S ABOUT TO START.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.467
THE SURGERY WITH NO HOPE?

25:06.500 --> 25:08.667
SHUT UP.

25:08.700 --> 25:10.433
(door closes)

25:10.467 --> 25:14.067
SO WHO'S THE NEW MYSTERY WOMAN
THAT DEREK'S DATING?

25:14.100 --> 25:17.200
WHO'S THE UNLUCKY McREBOUND?

25:17.233 --> 25:19.067
(laughs)

25:19.100 --> 25:22.400
WHAT? OH, IS THE--
THE WHOLE "Mc" THING OVER NOW?

25:22.433 --> 25:25.400
I MEAN, SURELY THINGS HAVEN'T
CHANGED THAT MUCH AROUND HERE.

25:25.433 --> 25:27.633
ADDISON, THE WOMAN STANDING
IMMEDIATELY TO YOUR RIGHT,

25:27.667 --> 25:31.700
THE ONE HANDING YOU
THE SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS...

25:33.500 --> 25:34.433
HEY.

25:34.467 --> 25:35.567
HEY.

25:35.600 --> 25:38.367
SIX DATES, HEAVY PETTING,
LOTS OF TONGUE--GOOD GUY.

25:38.400 --> 25:40.467
SCALPEL?

25:42.300 --> 25:44.733
(clears throat)

25:44.767 --> 25:47.833
WE CAN HAVE THE BABY? YOU'RE
SAYING WE CAN HAVE THE BABY--

25:47.867 --> 25:49.667
A HEALTHY BABY.

25:49.700 --> 25:51.367
WITH THE PROPER
PRENATAL TREATMENT,

25:51.400 --> 25:54.667
UM, THE RISKS TO YOUR BABY
ARE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED.

25:54.700 --> 25:56.533
I HAVEN'T FOUND YOU
AN O.B. YET,

25:56.567 --> 25:59.200
AND I THINK THE PROCESS
MIGHT PROVE REALLY DIFFICULT--
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

25:59.233 --> 26:01.133
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
WE CAN FIGURE ANYTHING OUT.

26:01.167 --> 26:03.067
UH, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
THANK YOU.

26:03.100 --> 26:05.400
NO! NO.
DO NOT THANK HER.

26:05.433 --> 26:08.833
(scoffs) I ASKED YOU
TO DO ONE THING.

26:08.867 --> 26:12.033
I-I ASKED YOU
TO SCHEDULE AN ABORTION.
SARAH--

26:12.067 --> 26:14.533
NO. SHE JUST WALKS IN HERE
AND GETS YOUR HOPES UP,

26:14.567 --> 26:15.767
AND THAT'S NOT OKAY.

26:15.800 --> 26:17.633
I WAS DIAGNOSED AT 19,

26:17.667 --> 26:19.567
AND I HAVE LEARNED
HOW TO DEAL WITH IT.

26:19.600 --> 26:22.333
BUT I WILL NOT PUT THAT
ONTO A BABY.

26:22.367 --> 26:24.533
I CANNOT BRING A BABY
INTO THIS WORLD

26:24.567 --> 26:26.767
WHO COULD POSSIBLY HAVE
THIS DISEASE.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.700
I WON'T.

26:28.733 --> 26:32.167
NOW... COULD YOU PLEASE
JUST SCHEDULE THE ABORTION?

26:32.200 --> 26:35.167
AND DO ME A FAVOR.
DON'T COME BACK.

26:35.200 --> 26:38.100
I'D LIKE A DIFFERENT DOCTOR.

26:38.133 --> 26:41.567
***

26:47.333 --> 26:50.667
(laughing)

26:50.700 --> 26:53.567
***

26:53.600 --> 26:56.667
(laughing continues)

26:56.700 --> 27:00.133
PHILLIP, REMEMBER WHAT
WE TALKED ABOUT?

27:00.167 --> 27:03.300
(laughs) JENNIFER.

27:03.333 --> 27:04.667
JENN?

27:04.700 --> 27:06.600
JENNIFER!

27:06.633 --> 27:10.267
***

27:10.300 --> 27:13.167
I-I DON'T WANT
TO LEAVE YOU ALONE.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.100
I-I WANT YOU TO MEET SOMEONE.

27:15.133 --> 27:17.667
I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME
YOU'LL TRY.

27:17.700 --> 27:19.300
'CAUSE...

27:19.333 --> 27:22.633
I CAN'T--I CAN'T DO THIS
THINKING I'M LEAVING YOU ALONE.

THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO CLOSE.

28:49.633 --> 28:52.667
OKAY, GET THE BABY TO HAHN.
ADDIE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.767

HIDING IN THE CLINIC.

28:56.800 --> 28:59.200
YEAH? OKAY. LISTEN, IZZIE--
I LOST THE CONTEST.

28:59.233 --> 29:02.600
I COULDN'T HACK CARDIO.
I PERFORMED C.P.R. ON A DEER.
IZZIE...

29:02.633 --> 29:05.733
I THINK I'VE BEEN HIDING. I--
YOU CAN'T COME
PLAY DARTS WITH US TONIGHT.

I-I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SAY THIS.
YOU SHOULD GET THIS.

GET WHAT?
YOU'RE--YOU'RE NOT
AN INTERN ANYMORE.

29:10.600 --> 29:12.500

I'M NOT A RESIDENT.

29:12.533 --> 29:15.567

I'M TRYING TO STOP COMPLAINING

29:18.367 --> 29:20.033

IS NEW FRIENDS

YOU'RE HERE TO PUSH
SOME KIND OF AGENDA, RIGHT?

29:51.633 --> 29:55.100
NO. NO. LISTEN... IF YOU WANT
TO HAVE AN ABORTION

29:55.133 --> 29:57.033
BECAUSE YOU WANT
TO HAVE AN ABORTION,

29:57.067 --> 29:59.533
THEN THAT'S BETWEEN YOU
AND WHATEVER GOD YOU BELIEVE IN.

29:59.567 --> 30:01.467
BUT IF YOU WANT
TO HAVE AN ABORTION

30:01.500 --> 30:03.767
BECAUSE YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT
MEDICINE IS TELLING YOU TO DO,

30:03.800 --> 30:05.700
THEN THAT'S BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

30:05.733 --> 30:08.400
I WAS INEFFECTUAL.
I WAS UNCLEAR.

30:08.433 --> 30:10.333
I'VE BEEN ON MY HEELS
A LITTLE BIT LATELY,

30:10.367 --> 30:12.800

SO JUST LISTEN, OKAY?

30:12.833 --> 30:14.733
I WASN'T TELLING YOU
THERE IS SOME CHANCE

30:14.767 --> 30:16.667

MIGHT NOT BE BORN SICK.

PERFECTLY HEALTHY--

30:22.567 --> 30:23.767
A 98% CHANCE.

30:23.800 --> 30:26.267
THERE'S A HIGHER CHANCE
OF YOUR BABY BEING BORN

30:26.300 --> 30:27.367
WITH DOWN SYNDROME

30:27.400 --> 30:29.533

H.I.V. ON TO YOUR CHILD.

30:29.567 --> 30:31.533
I DON'T... I JUST--
I-I CAN'T--

30:31.567 --> 30:35.033
I KNOW YOU GAVE UP ON
HAVING CHILDREN A LONG TIME AGO,

30:35.067 --> 30:36.800

THAT IT'S DIFFICULT

30:36.833 --> 30:39.167
TO READJUST YOUR THINKING
SO QUICKLY,

30:39.200 --> 30:41.467
BUT, SARAH, IF YOU TAKE
YOUR MEDS RESPONSIBLY,

30:41.500 --> 30:45.100
THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU CAN'T
HAVE A BEAUTIFUL, HEALTHY BABY.
