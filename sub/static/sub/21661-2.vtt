WEBVTT

01:27.712 --> 01:29.047
Darn it!

01:29.923 --> 01:31.299
Is this necessary?

01:31.716 --> 01:32.926
-Yes.
-Yes.

01:33.134 --> 01:33.968
Fine.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.640
Has it ever been this difficult
in finding a tenant before?

01:39.432 --> 01:41.142
It has never taken more than a month.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.646
Really? Why can't we find someone?

01:45.271 --> 01:49.442
I spoke to Ms. Ha,
and she said we were too picky.

01:52.695 --> 01:56.574
I know why we can't find a tenant.

01:58.034 --> 02:01.412
A friend from my department was looking
for a place, so I told her about ours,

02:01.955 --> 02:04.124
and she said something weird.

02:04.207 --> 02:06.960
She said there was a bad rumor
about our house.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.879
Are rumors spreading already?

02:10.547 --> 02:12.799
-Then...
-I heard that, too.

02:12.882 --> 02:14.968
I hear Yoon-jin is saying stupid things.

02:15.051 --> 02:16.594
They aren't stupid.

02:16.719 --> 02:19.681
It's true. A powerful curse...

02:19.764 --> 02:21.391
-Yoon-jin?
-You remember.

02:21.474 --> 02:23.476
She couldn't even last the whole of May.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.312
-What did she say?
-Well...

02:26.396 --> 02:28.314
They're terrible.

02:28.606 --> 02:31.359
They might smile around you,
but they'll totally make you an outcast.

02:31.651 --> 02:34.571
What are they, 12 years old?
How could college students do that?

02:35.613 --> 02:37.365
-Are they talking about us?
-Exactly.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.159
Right?

02:39.284 --> 02:41.703
-Excuse me.
-They were nagging me from day one.

02:41.786 --> 02:43.830
I got crap for leaving the Wi-Fi on,

02:43.913 --> 02:46.082
for brushing my teeth
with the water running...

02:46.499 --> 02:49.335
They whined about the utility bill
being higher than the previous month.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.629
They were so strict.

02:53.840 --> 02:57.093
What's worse is,
they would talk amongst themselves,

02:57.176 --> 02:59.512
and stop once I walked into the room.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.140
When I asked what it was,
they would say it was nothing.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.851
If it was nothing, why did they stop
when I walked in?

03:04.934 --> 03:06.311
Do you know how crappy that feels?

03:07.270 --> 03:10.982
They would talk about people
only they know, make secret jokes...

03:11.608 --> 03:13.818
Why do I care who Yi-na is?

03:13.902 --> 03:16.279
"Yi-na did this," and "Yi-na did that."

03:16.362 --> 03:19.991
You were wrong. How could
educated people make someone an outcast?

03:20.283 --> 03:22.619
Look at you now.
I'm trying to talk, but...

03:22.702 --> 03:23.703
Especially that big mouth.

03:23.786 --> 03:26.331
She's really the absolute worst.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.667
She's... She's just...

03:30.752 --> 03:32.545
I never met anyone like that before.

03:32.837 --> 03:35.632
If she were a guy, she would be in jail
for sexual harassment by now.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.051
Every time she opens her mouth...

03:39.594 --> 03:42.805
How could she ask me
what's my favorite position?

03:48.645 --> 03:49.520
What time is it?

03:50.438 --> 03:52.232
It's 3:45 p.m.

03:52.732 --> 03:53.775
What time is she coming?

03:54.108 --> 03:56.152
She said around 4 p.m.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.780
Did you see her ID?

03:59.239 --> 04:00.657
The one checking out the room.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.617
-What is it?
-Beyoncé.

04:03.451 --> 04:04.702
Beyoncé From Behind.

04:05.411 --> 04:06.913
Beyoncé From Behind.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.874
That means she has a fat butt.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.713
What? Why is she so early?

04:15.880 --> 04:16.965
Just a minute.

04:20.051 --> 04:20.927
Everyone, ready?

04:43.199 --> 04:46.494
EPISODE 2
COWARD #TheStranger

04:47.954 --> 04:49.455
Hello...

04:57.422 --> 04:59.132
Did you come to see the room?

05:01.426 --> 05:03.928
Is this Yeonnam-ro 22?

05:04.929 --> 05:05.763
Yes.

05:06.514 --> 05:08.391
Yes, it is. Come in.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.156
-She's a girl, right?
-Yes.

05:23.906 --> 05:25.074
How tall is she?

05:27.577 --> 05:29.871
Belle Epoque Rules

05:46.054 --> 05:48.181
Let me show you the room. This way.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.224
The room?

05:50.850 --> 05:52.685
Yes. It's this one.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.494
You checked the details
on the site, right?

06:28.638 --> 06:30.139
Don't you have any questions?

06:34.769 --> 06:36.521
Do all four of you live here?

06:37.980 --> 06:39.065
Yes.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.484
Has it been long?

06:41.943 --> 06:43.861
I don't know what you consider long,

06:44.112 --> 06:45.738
but everyone has been here
for over a year.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.964
We'll talk with the owner
and get back to you.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.479
She's quiet, especially for that height.

07:18.563 --> 07:21.149
-Yes.
-She looks rude. And she's so tall.

07:21.816 --> 07:24.819
At first, I thought she was a guy
because she was so tall.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.905
Why is her ID "Beyoncé From Behind"
when she's just tall?

07:29.532 --> 07:32.618
I'll come by around four tomorrow.
I look forward to meeting you.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.078
You're right.

07:34.412 --> 07:37.373
Most people who put Beyoncé
in their IDs have big butts.

07:38.708 --> 07:41.169
I think she looks more like athletes.

07:41.919 --> 07:43.838
So? Yes or no?

07:45.798 --> 07:48.134
I'm kind of...

07:48.217 --> 07:51.095
Right? Me, too.

07:53.264 --> 07:55.308
One oddball per house is enough.

07:56.392 --> 07:57.727
At least one, you know.

07:58.227 --> 07:59.145
Then it's a "no."

08:03.316 --> 08:05.401
Hello, Ms. Ha. Where are you?

08:06.652 --> 08:07.653
How is the weather?

08:09.489 --> 08:10.823
How nice.

08:12.450 --> 08:15.036
The room? Well, the thing is...

08:17.955 --> 08:18.998
No.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.501
We just rented it out.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.586
Yes, of course.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.172
Her contact information?

08:26.672 --> 08:28.466
Her name is Eun Cho.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.384
Yes, Eun.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.178
-What? Why?
-And the number is...

08:32.261 --> 08:34.180
Ms. Ha must have said something.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.392
What time is it in Chile?
How is she awake at this hour?

08:41.479 --> 08:44.106
How could you do that on your own?

08:44.232 --> 08:46.567
She said if we don't have a tenant,
her friend will move in.

08:50.821 --> 08:53.991
Well, rather than
living with an old lady...

08:54.116 --> 08:55.368
The tall Beyoncé is better.

08:55.993 --> 08:58.663
Tall and silent Beyoncé.

09:09.590 --> 09:10.466
Who is it?

09:11.050 --> 09:12.635
I'm here to see the room.

09:13.344 --> 09:14.470
The room has been rented.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.932
-What?
-We just rented it out.

09:18.599 --> 09:19.809
I'm sorry.

09:20.142 --> 09:21.435
What the...

09:53.676 --> 09:54.802
I'm moving out.

10:01.183 --> 10:02.018
Why?

10:04.562 --> 10:06.063
I need to look into something.

10:07.523 --> 10:09.066
You've got to be kidding me.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.569
What? You always told me to move out.

10:12.862 --> 10:13.988
Just because...

10:18.826 --> 10:20.161
Do as you wish.

10:20.244 --> 10:23.497
Leave if you want.
Come home when you want.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.500
It's not like things go my way.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.337
Nothing goes my way, anyway.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.435
Coming!

10:49.732 --> 10:51.442
Hi. Come in.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.615
-Is that all you have?
-Yes.

11:07.458 --> 11:10.544
Well, I was just reminded of the past.

11:11.671 --> 11:15.424
When I first moved in,
my luggage fell over, too...

11:19.136 --> 11:21.263
Well... Never mind.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.810
You can use the bottom shelf
of the shoe closet.

11:25.893 --> 11:27.853
Why is mine the bottom shelf?

11:32.608 --> 11:34.318
It must be inconvenient,
since you're tall.

11:34.652 --> 11:35.694
Then switch with me.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.805
Everyone uses their own toiletries.

12:03.180 --> 12:06.392
We use different colored baskets
to avoid confusion.

12:07.059 --> 12:10.646
There are already pink,
blue, purple, and white,

12:10.813 --> 12:12.773
so you can use any other color.

12:17.027 --> 12:18.612
Eun-jae, Ji-won, Jin-myung

12:18.696 --> 12:21.323
We have designated shelves
in the fridge, too,

12:21.407 --> 12:22.950
but it's hard to stick to it.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.828
It's best to put your name
on the containers.

12:26.954 --> 12:29.290
We buy instant noodles and rice
collectively.

12:29.623 --> 12:31.667
At first, we got them separately, too,

12:32.001 --> 12:34.628
but it's cheaper to buy in bulk,
and there isn't enough room.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.047
We go shopping every other week...

12:40.217 --> 12:42.595
What? Is there anything else
you want to know?

12:44.054 --> 12:45.264
It's never-ending.

12:46.390 --> 12:47.391
Is there a lot more left?

13:02.156 --> 13:05.242
Why are you sitting there like that?
Is she not here yet?

13:06.076 --> 13:07.077
She's here.

13:08.245 --> 13:10.080
I thought you were going
to show her around.

13:10.414 --> 13:11.248
I know.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.584
You said you would explain everything,

13:13.667 --> 13:15.794
which you wanted someone else
to do for you.

13:16.587 --> 13:19.507
Well, I wanted to, but...

13:20.966 --> 13:23.719
What? Did the new kid look down on you?

13:24.762 --> 13:25.971
Already? You poor thing.

13:26.555 --> 13:27.932
Eun-jae.

13:29.558 --> 13:30.893
You foolish kid.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.021
Watch us.

13:36.065 --> 13:36.899
Watch and learn.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.404
Eun?

13:43.948 --> 13:45.866
What are you doing? Unpacking?

13:49.286 --> 13:51.705
Oh, my gosh.
Are these all the clothes you have?

13:52.289 --> 13:56.627
What kind of a girl wears only black?
This is black, too, and so is this.

14:09.139 --> 14:10.057
What a simple life.

14:11.016 --> 14:13.018
It's nice. A minimalist life.

14:14.645 --> 14:17.022
You're a Korean literature major?

14:17.106 --> 14:18.607
Language and literature.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.025
Language and literature.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.777
Language and literature means
you'll have...

14:27.032 --> 14:29.952
Well, not all language and literature
majors like to read.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.705
DELAYED JUSTICE

14:32.788 --> 14:33.873
Is this fun?

14:39.128 --> 14:41.255
I can't stand people touching my things.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.095
Sorry.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.265
Do you have something else to say?

15:16.415 --> 15:17.541
What's up?

15:18.584 --> 15:19.418
What?

15:21.253 --> 15:22.338
She...

15:25.424 --> 15:26.592
Yes?

15:30.346 --> 15:31.388
Can you come out?

15:33.182 --> 15:35.309
-Why?
-What?

15:37.394 --> 15:40.564
It's your first day. Let's have a beer.

15:43.901 --> 15:44.860
I'm tired.

15:49.198 --> 15:51.617
It will be quick.
I would like to talk to you, too.

16:05.756 --> 16:07.508
Here's to your first day.

16:08.008 --> 16:09.218
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.771
Have you lived with others before?

16:23.148 --> 16:25.317
-No.
-Do you have any siblings?

16:29.154 --> 16:30.155
Why?

16:31.991 --> 16:34.284
You seem uncomfortable hanging out
with people your age.

16:36.036 --> 16:37.454
You don't have any siblings, right?

16:38.163 --> 16:39.206
Well...

16:48.674 --> 16:49.842
I THOUGHT YOU HAD QUESTIONS?

16:51.093 --> 16:52.344
HER HEIGHT?

16:52.469 --> 16:53.637
That thing.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.222
THE BEYONCÉ THING?

16:59.268 --> 17:01.311
Do you like Beyoncé?

17:03.772 --> 17:04.773
No.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.424
Do you have an older brother?

17:34.845 --> 17:37.931
-I just said I had no siblings.
-That's right.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.727
You have an uncle, right?
How old is your youngest uncle?

17:49.693 --> 17:52.946
Well... This is actually a funny joke.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.699
But you need to respond,

17:56.658 --> 17:59.369
so that I can ask you
to introduce me or to get out.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.789
And we laugh.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.501
Laugh.

18:06.877 --> 18:11.006
We'll have a lot of conflicts at first,
since we're complete strangers.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.927
You'll have to say what you want,
but you'll have to hold back as well.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.888
Anyway, I hope we get along.

18:20.432 --> 18:21.475
Well, whatever.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.269
Are we done?

18:26.605 --> 18:27.856
Hey.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.530
You should clean after yourself.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.867
She's very unique.

19:20.576 --> 19:21.577
Unique?

19:22.369 --> 19:24.746
-She's a disrespectful brat.
-I agree.

19:25.455 --> 19:27.040
A newbie should behave like one.

19:27.624 --> 19:29.209
Be a little shy, uncomfortable...

19:29.751 --> 19:31.170
-and cautious around us.
-Exactly.

19:33.714 --> 19:38.051
In that way, you were perfect. Right?

19:38.135 --> 19:38.969
Right?

19:40.596 --> 19:43.932
Right. She was always anxious,
like a puppy that needed to poop.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.063
Then what? Do we kick her out?

19:52.316 --> 19:54.401
Would you rather live
with Ms. Ha's friend?

19:58.405 --> 20:01.742
Let's assume she isn't familiar
with hanging out with people.

20:03.827 --> 20:06.830
We're the ones who are screwed
if she wants to move out.

20:14.421 --> 20:15.839
That room must be cursed.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.258
Yi-na had a temper, too.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.844
She wasn't that bad.

20:53.293 --> 20:54.503
Oh, my gosh.

20:56.838 --> 20:58.173
You scared me.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.359
What the heck?
Why was she staring at me like that?

21:19.945 --> 21:21.530
Hi there, beautiful. Did you wash up?

21:22.322 --> 21:24.866
-Do you want to lie with me?
-Shut it!

22:23.675 --> 22:24.885
It was a coincidence.

22:25.844 --> 22:26.845
Right?

22:27.512 --> 22:29.931
No. She does look at people
in a funny way.

22:30.724 --> 22:31.725
Instead of like this,

22:32.851 --> 22:34.519
-she looks at you like this.
-That's right.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.981
She looks at you like this. It's annoying.

22:38.648 --> 22:40.859
Really? I didn't notice.

22:41.443 --> 22:44.738
Actually, when I was picking tomatoes
on the roof,

22:45.822 --> 22:49.576
-she came up and asked about you.
-Me?

22:51.620 --> 22:52.954
What about?

22:53.038 --> 22:54.623
If anything happened to you last year.

22:55.957 --> 22:57.918
Really? That's strange.

22:58.418 --> 23:00.212
She asked me about you.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.964
If anything happened to you last year.

23:03.590 --> 23:06.134
What the heck? That's so weird.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.136
Maybe she wants to get to know us?

23:08.220 --> 23:10.764
Then she should ask us directly.

23:10.847 --> 23:12.099
My point exactly.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.185
Come to think of it...

23:16.269 --> 23:17.521
What?

23:18.188 --> 23:19.481
Did something happen to you, too?

23:20.857 --> 23:22.442
Not really "happen."

23:23.151 --> 23:25.195
I thought I saw wrong, but...

23:25.904 --> 23:28.907
SOO-MYUNG YOON

23:38.959 --> 23:40.127
Was it Eun?

23:41.086 --> 23:42.546
Well, I'm not sure.

23:43.672 --> 23:46.049
Thinking about it now,
I feel like it might have been.

23:46.716 --> 23:50.762
She was tall, thin, and wearing all black.

23:51.638 --> 23:52.472
It was her.

23:52.556 --> 23:55.392
Who else wears all black in the summer?

23:56.226 --> 23:58.478
What the heck? I just got chills.

23:59.020 --> 24:00.063
She even follows people.

24:04.151 --> 24:07.028
Why? What is it?
Did something happen to you, too?

24:09.489 --> 24:11.366
What is it? It's okay. Tell us.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.326
What is it?

24:17.539 --> 24:18.999
-Nothing.
-What?

24:19.583 --> 24:21.168
She didn't do anything to me.

24:22.335 --> 24:25.213
She didn't watch me from afar,
ask strange questions,

24:25.797 --> 24:26.756
or follow me.

24:28.216 --> 24:31.303
I'm offended. Is this how it feels
to be an outcast?

24:31.887 --> 24:33.638
You call that a problem?

24:33.847 --> 24:37.851
Everything else aside, let's fix the
bathroom's doorknob as soon as possible.

24:39.895 --> 24:40.812
What's up?

24:45.066 --> 24:46.693
Someone left a pot on the stove.

24:47.861 --> 24:48.695
Oh, no.

24:52.574 --> 24:53.909
Is it burned?

24:53.992 --> 24:55.619
-That was close.
-It didn't burn.

24:56.203 --> 24:57.287
No?

24:58.455 --> 24:59.497
Excuse me.

25:01.458 --> 25:04.085
I sent my portion of living expenses
to your bank account.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.005
My name is Jin-myung.

25:08.465 --> 25:09.424
I know, but...

25:11.009 --> 25:12.636
I don't know how to address you.

25:13.511 --> 25:15.847
You can treat me like a sister
like the others do.

25:16.890 --> 25:18.308
A sister is too weird.

25:19.809 --> 25:21.937
It's not like we're related or anything.

25:41.414 --> 25:42.999
Who is it?

25:43.083 --> 25:44.167
Eun lives here, right?

25:44.251 --> 25:46.044
No, there is no one by that name.

25:52.092 --> 25:54.761
Just a minute!

25:59.641 --> 26:00.600
It's me.

26:01.601 --> 26:02.894
She said you weren't here.

26:08.525 --> 26:09.734
You're early.

26:10.443 --> 26:12.529
-No, I just...
-Come in.

26:22.038 --> 26:24.165
-Who is it?
-Hello.

26:25.542 --> 26:26.626
I'm Eun's friend.

26:27.043 --> 26:28.920
I heard she moved, so I wanted...

26:29.004 --> 26:30.755
-Come in.
-I wanted to visit.

26:37.178 --> 26:40.890
Were you sleeping? Your hair is all messy.

26:53.903 --> 26:56.614
-So? Is that them?
-Yes.

26:57.866 --> 26:59.034
Did you find out who it was?

26:59.951 --> 27:00.910
No, not yet.

27:02.329 --> 27:03.872
They all look normal enough.

27:08.710 --> 27:10.337
A housewarming gift.

27:11.755 --> 27:13.715
Why did you bother?
I won't be staying long.

27:14.299 --> 27:16.259
Still. Open it.

27:22.599 --> 27:24.059
Aren't they cute?

27:26.436 --> 27:27.354
Look.

27:32.567 --> 27:34.486
Hey. Stop that.

27:37.405 --> 27:39.240
Don't take it off.

27:48.583 --> 27:49.584
What are you doing?

27:52.170 --> 27:53.004
Well...

27:54.964 --> 27:56.716
She brought a friend.

27:57.300 --> 28:00.178
That's right.
It woke us up early in the morning.

28:02.013 --> 28:05.016
And they closed the door.
They're in there alone.

28:06.226 --> 28:07.435
Is it a guy?

28:09.020 --> 28:10.146
No, but...

28:18.279 --> 28:19.114
Bye.

28:19.906 --> 28:21.533
Can't you walk me to the bus stop?

28:22.033 --> 28:23.118
No. Why?

28:23.410 --> 28:24.536
Come on.

28:43.930 --> 28:45.765
-What's wrong?
-The onion is rotten.

28:45.849 --> 28:47.517
I said not to buy so many.

28:49.769 --> 28:51.688
-Is it too sweet?
-Put it in my mouth.

28:55.233 --> 28:56.776
It's hot!

29:06.077 --> 29:08.329
-Did your friend leave?
-Yes.

29:10.206 --> 29:12.292
Let us know in advance
if your friends or family visit.

29:13.168 --> 29:14.419
That's the rule.

29:14.502 --> 29:15.795
Sure.

29:17.213 --> 29:19.090
Your friend is really cute.

29:19.883 --> 29:22.552
Right?
We saw you when we were coming home.

29:23.386 --> 29:26.139
You two looked... If others saw you...

29:26.222 --> 29:27.891
Your chemistry was so...

29:28.808 --> 29:29.768
What does that mean?

29:32.479 --> 29:33.480
What?

29:39.360 --> 29:42.113
I was just saying,

29:43.448 --> 29:46.201
you're complete opposites,
so you're a good match.

29:55.543 --> 29:58.379
I was just kidding.

29:59.756 --> 30:01.049
Did I say something bad?

30:02.217 --> 30:05.011
Not really.
You were being your usual self.

30:06.137 --> 30:07.138
Right?

30:09.390 --> 30:11.142
Why is she getting angry
about strange things?

30:13.436 --> 30:14.562
So?

30:15.438 --> 30:16.523
Should we call her out?

30:18.066 --> 30:19.943
I might get sick if I eat with her.

30:22.445 --> 30:24.364
But we can't eat by ourselves.

30:29.953 --> 30:30.912
This isn't fair.

30:31.496 --> 30:34.040
-Why should we tip-toe around the newbie?
-You spilled.

30:35.959 --> 30:39.128
If people saw us now,
they would say we were excluding her.

30:40.088 --> 30:44.467
People get angry
if a secret they want to hide gets out.

30:45.134 --> 30:45.969
What?

30:48.638 --> 30:50.139
Psychologically...

30:51.891 --> 30:54.394
What you mean is, Eun...

30:54.477 --> 30:55.854
No way.

30:56.521 --> 30:58.606
It's not that common.

30:59.983 --> 31:02.527
It isn't, but it does exist.

31:02.610 --> 31:03.695
What if that's true?

31:04.654 --> 31:06.990
What do you mean? If it's true, it's true.

31:07.574 --> 31:09.200
-Still...
-Still what?

31:09.701 --> 31:11.452
Will you discriminate against her?

31:11.536 --> 31:14.330
No, I don't mean we should discriminate.

31:14.414 --> 31:16.165
I don't like it.

31:16.958 --> 31:18.835
Right? It's kind of uncomfortable.

31:19.544 --> 31:21.004
It's not uncomfortable, but...

31:24.549 --> 31:25.758
It's just...

31:31.306 --> 31:34.100
Eun-jae, would it be uncomfortable for you
if Eun were a lesbian?

31:36.477 --> 31:37.562
Yes.

31:38.062 --> 31:40.273
I may be lame,

31:40.857 --> 31:42.942
but I've never met one before.

31:43.693 --> 31:44.569
To be blunt,

31:45.445 --> 31:47.989
isn't it like living with a guy?

31:49.574 --> 31:50.617
Is it?

31:52.243 --> 31:53.453
So, do we kick her out?

31:53.953 --> 31:55.663
I'm not saying we should discriminate.

31:55.747 --> 31:58.583
If the parties are uncomfortable,
one party should leave.

31:58.666 --> 32:00.043
That's discrimination.

32:02.086 --> 32:04.464
The two of you don't care at all?

32:05.798 --> 32:06.799
Not really.

32:07.967 --> 32:10.428
It's only because it's new.
Once we get used to it...

32:12.305 --> 32:14.515
You start class next week, right?
Will you be okay?

32:16.392 --> 32:19.562
I have no choice.
I can't take two years off.

32:20.647 --> 32:21.773
I'll have to deal somehow.

32:24.359 --> 32:25.193
What about you?

32:26.152 --> 32:29.280
It's not like I can take time off
from school for something like that.

32:30.114 --> 32:32.116
What about you?
When is your final interview?

32:34.619 --> 32:35.620
This Friday.

32:50.510 --> 32:53.846
CRIME SCENE 3

33:01.688 --> 33:02.855
What are you doing?

33:03.022 --> 33:04.023
Watching something.

33:06.776 --> 33:08.528
Do you want to go
to the convenience store?

33:09.320 --> 33:10.196
The convenience store?

33:11.406 --> 33:12.490
Yes.

33:13.241 --> 33:14.575
Can we go a little later?

33:17.078 --> 33:18.413
The thing is...

33:19.455 --> 33:22.625
I need to send a package by today.

33:24.043 --> 33:25.378
Give me a minute.

33:46.607 --> 33:49.485
Don't you need to start going around
by yourself?

33:50.153 --> 33:50.987
I do.

33:54.073 --> 33:55.825
How will you go to school?

33:57.618 --> 33:59.203
I have you and Ji-won.

33:59.912 --> 34:01.706
Yoo-kyung and Kyung-ah, too.

34:18.639 --> 34:20.892
-Your room is so loud.
-Right?

34:21.059 --> 34:22.268
Even if I shut the window.

34:22.685 --> 34:23.811
That's why it was so cheap.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.439
It looks completely different
from the picture.

34:26.689 --> 34:28.983
It looked pretty,
with a garden and everything.

34:29.525 --> 34:32.570
It's a different place. The one you saw
was Belle Epoque in Yeonnam.

34:33.988 --> 34:35.948
Those people were rude jerks, too.

34:36.032 --> 34:38.076
I even made an appointment
to see the room,

34:38.159 --> 34:39.660
-and they said it was taken,
-Let's go.

34:39.744 --> 34:41.162
and wouldn't even let me in.

34:41.412 --> 34:42.622
And you just let that slide?

34:43.623 --> 34:44.791
-I'm too old to care.
-What?

34:44.874 --> 34:47.126
-Beyoncé.
-Beyoncé what?

34:58.221 --> 34:59.097
What the heck?

35:01.432 --> 35:03.392
You need an ID to buy beer.

35:10.817 --> 35:11.984
Do I look that young?

35:12.401 --> 35:14.278
No way. How?

35:20.034 --> 35:21.035
Where are you coming from?

35:23.121 --> 35:23.996
Is something wrong?

35:34.757 --> 35:36.843
-Yes?
-We need to talk.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.700
The day you first came here,
how did you know about here?

36:01.576 --> 36:02.952
Why did you come to this place?

36:04.871 --> 36:08.541
I heard from a friend
that you had an empty room.

36:08.875 --> 36:09.959
That's not true.

36:10.042 --> 36:12.670
You said you saw it on the rental site.

36:12.753 --> 36:14.338
Beyoncé From Behind.

36:16.257 --> 36:17.383
I never said that.

36:18.676 --> 36:19.927
You did.

36:20.803 --> 36:21.637
Right?

36:27.685 --> 36:29.478
Did you come to see the room?

36:30.813 --> 36:32.940
Is this Yeonnam-ro 22?

36:35.526 --> 36:36.652
Let me show you the room.

36:37.653 --> 36:38.487
The room?

36:41.908 --> 36:44.493
We'll talk with the owner
and get back to you.

36:49.248 --> 36:50.082
That's strange.

36:51.459 --> 36:52.710
I'm sure she did.

36:53.961 --> 36:57.340
But you knew we had mistaken you
for someone else, didn't you?

36:57.632 --> 36:59.050
Didn't you?

36:59.967 --> 37:03.137
Well, I did think it was strange.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.513
Then why didn't you say anything?

37:06.349 --> 37:07.516
Well,

37:08.017 --> 37:10.269
I don't need to tell you
every little thing.

37:13.439 --> 37:16.025
-If you're done...
-Where is your family?

37:17.443 --> 37:18.444
In Seongsan-dong.

37:18.527 --> 37:20.488
You said your school was in Bukgajwa-dong.

37:22.365 --> 37:23.532
So?

37:23.908 --> 37:25.034
So why are you here?

37:26.410 --> 37:27.370
Can't I be?

37:36.337 --> 37:37.421
What about Seongsan-dong?

37:38.381 --> 37:40.925
Seongsan-dong and Bukgajwa-dong
are very close.

37:43.761 --> 37:44.637
What's going on?

37:45.221 --> 37:47.056
She isn't Beyoncé.

37:48.182 --> 37:49.058
It's someone else.

37:50.935 --> 37:53.271
-She's very suspicious.
-Yes.

37:54.605 --> 37:56.983
She's hiding something.

37:58.484 --> 37:59.402
What?

38:09.954 --> 38:11.372
It's like they have their guards up.

38:11.998 --> 38:14.041
It's not like they were friendly
to begin with.

38:14.875 --> 38:15.960
Then were you caught?

38:16.794 --> 38:17.878
I'm not sure yet.

38:18.671 --> 38:20.298
So? What will you do?

38:21.590 --> 38:23.426
What is there to do?
If I'm caught, I'm caught.

38:25.261 --> 38:26.345
That's so lame.

38:27.138 --> 38:28.889
Then why did you bother moving in there?

38:29.557 --> 38:32.310
You should cause a big scene.

38:33.644 --> 38:34.687
Are you having fun?

38:34.770 --> 38:36.731
Of course. It's someone else's life.

38:39.191 --> 38:40.359
How does it look?

38:43.195 --> 38:45.823
It's so pretty. This was meant for you.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.241
Isn't she pretty?

38:57.668 --> 38:58.711
Eun.

39:05.343 --> 39:06.552
I was about to call.

39:07.720 --> 39:08.554
Why?

39:10.931 --> 39:12.808
Your mom said...

39:13.351 --> 39:16.312
She isn't my mom,
but your legal wife for now.

39:20.191 --> 39:21.233
You moved out?

39:26.697 --> 39:29.575
Is something wrong?
Everything is okay, right?

39:30.242 --> 39:31.452
I saw you a few days ago.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.204
What?

39:35.081 --> 39:36.082
Where?

39:48.511 --> 39:49.887
You had a big smile on your face.

39:51.847 --> 39:53.099
I guess you were in a good mood.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.852
-I don't know. When...
-So...

39:58.646 --> 39:59.730
that pissed me off.

41:19.518 --> 41:21.103
-Good morning!
-Good morning.

41:32.198 --> 41:33.824
Good morning.

41:34.158 --> 41:35.534
Hi. Did you sleep well?

41:35.910 --> 41:36.744
Yes.

41:45.419 --> 41:46.879
I'm leaving.

41:47.463 --> 41:48.714
-Interview?
-Yes.

41:49.131 --> 41:51.759
-Good luck. You can do it!
-Thanks.

41:59.183 --> 42:00.601
How many times has she done it?

42:01.685 --> 42:04.438
I stopped counting
once it hit double digits.

42:08.776 --> 42:10.945
It will get harder
if it doesn't happen this year.

42:35.678 --> 42:37.805
What's wrong? Do you feel sick?

42:38.764 --> 42:40.391
Yes, a little.

42:46.272 --> 42:48.899
Then who will take me
to the hospital today?

42:50.568 --> 42:53.070
I can't. I have plans today.

43:13.132 --> 43:15.301
Daddy!

43:17.219 --> 43:18.887
Daddy!

43:19.680 --> 43:20.806
Get away.

43:22.725 --> 43:23.642
It's okay.

43:26.353 --> 43:28.147
Were you scared? It's okay.

43:37.489 --> 43:39.283
What? What are you doing?

43:40.492 --> 43:42.202
I thought you were having a nightmare.

43:50.461 --> 43:51.462
I guess no one is at home.

43:53.255 --> 43:54.256
What?

43:56.425 --> 43:57.593
Why?

43:58.552 --> 43:59.678
It's quiet.

44:00.638 --> 44:01.722
They will be back soon.

44:02.389 --> 44:04.725
They're all nearby.

44:06.477 --> 44:07.645
That's strange.

44:08.312 --> 44:10.356
I thought everyone said
they would be home late today.

44:13.901 --> 44:15.319
Then why did you ask?

44:18.113 --> 44:19.198
It's just that I forgot.

44:20.449 --> 44:22.159
Me, too. I forgot.

44:27.414 --> 44:29.083
I should go to my room.

44:44.556 --> 44:46.266
What was that? What did she mean?

44:47.184 --> 44:48.519
So what if no one is at home?

44:49.478 --> 44:51.063
So what if they come home late?

46:05.679 --> 46:07.181
Good morning.

46:07.514 --> 46:09.099
Hi. Did you sleep well?

46:09.391 --> 46:10.225
Yes.

46:25.365 --> 46:26.742
Excuse me.

46:27.534 --> 46:28.827
Excuse me.

46:31.580 --> 46:32.623
Are you okay?

47:40.816 --> 47:42.401
EUN-JAE YOO

47:45.070 --> 47:47.781
OH &amp; PARK ENTERTAINMENT
INTERVIEW

48:07.301 --> 48:09.845
HIT SONGS OF IDOL GROUPS

48:42.377 --> 48:44.588
I start class next week.

48:45.380 --> 48:47.883
At times, I feel like I'll be fine,

48:47.966 --> 48:50.802
but at other times,
I don't think I can do it.

48:52.846 --> 48:56.183
It's still too hard for me
to go anywhere alone.

49:20.457 --> 49:21.541
This is nice.

49:22.042 --> 49:24.169
Please pick up.

49:25.504 --> 49:26.713
Please.

49:35.889 --> 49:38.433
Hey!

49:48.026 --> 49:49.403
Hey!

49:51.488 --> 49:52.406
Eun-jae!

49:52.906 --> 49:55.617
Hey! Eun-jae!

51:10.609 --> 51:11.985
Seriously.

51:17.657 --> 51:18.617
What's wrong with you?

51:20.577 --> 51:21.703
I don't know.

51:44.267 --> 51:47.562
I value the relationship
among team members,

51:47.646 --> 51:50.774
so my goal was to help them
understand each other.

51:51.358 --> 51:52.567
You graduated very late.

51:52.651 --> 51:54.903
But I don't see experience
to make up for it.

51:55.570 --> 51:56.530
What did you do?

51:57.113 --> 52:00.408
I worked several part-time jobs,
six to seven hours a day.

52:00.492 --> 52:02.911
I didn't do it for my resume.
I needed the money.

52:02.994 --> 52:05.288
If you worked that much,
you must not know about movies

52:05.789 --> 52:06.873
or music from our industry.

52:07.457 --> 52:09.125
No, I do not.

52:09.835 --> 52:12.921
The last movie I saw was Train to Busan.

52:14.339 --> 52:15.882
Do you know any singers?

52:17.175 --> 52:21.137
The only group whose members
I would recognize is Big Bang.

52:22.097 --> 52:24.182
JIN-MYUNG YOON
DESIRED DEPARTMENT: MANAGEMENT SUPPORT

52:41.116 --> 52:42.450
I'm a coward.

52:44.578 --> 52:47.956
I'm like a kid who closes her eyes
and swings away.

52:50.041 --> 52:51.793
I'm like a dog barking in fear.

52:54.713 --> 52:56.131
INTERVIEWS

52:56.298 --> 52:57.716
Excuse me.

52:58.091 --> 52:59.968
May I borrow your phone?

53:00.051 --> 53:01.386
It's an emergency.

53:02.220 --> 53:04.306
I'm not a strange man. Please...

53:05.348 --> 53:07.767
Hello. May I use your phone just once?

53:07.851 --> 53:10.020
It's an emergency, that's why.

53:12.230 --> 53:13.523
I'm a coward.

53:14.441 --> 53:15.525
I'm always afraid.

53:15.609 --> 53:17.152
I'm glad.

53:17.903 --> 53:19.237
It will be easier to go to school.

53:19.446 --> 53:21.323
Unfamiliar places are strange places.

53:22.073 --> 53:23.283
You need to go alone...

53:25.327 --> 53:27.454
Strange places become scary places.

53:28.788 --> 53:31.666
Scary places become bad places.

53:32.584 --> 53:34.669
-I need to use the bathroom.
-Me, too.

53:36.171 --> 53:37.297
Like that,

53:38.423 --> 53:41.051
unfamiliar places become scary places
that I must avoid.

53:44.262 --> 53:45.472
Nice, right?

53:50.226 --> 53:51.227
Are you having fun?

53:52.354 --> 53:53.647
This is pure heaven.

54:02.822 --> 54:04.157
Where are you going?

54:08.453 --> 54:10.080
I'm afraid again

54:11.790 --> 54:14.376
of seeming like a stranger to someone,

54:16.503 --> 54:17.587
of appearing weird.

54:19.381 --> 54:21.174
So I try my best

54:22.300 --> 54:24.344
to become like others.

54:24.928 --> 54:27.597
You ran so far. Why did you do that?

54:28.848 --> 54:31.559
What about you? Why did you come after me?

54:32.769 --> 54:33.979
Because you kept running.

55:00.755 --> 55:03.008
MEDICINE FOR COLD

55:05.719 --> 55:07.345
I'm scared again

55:11.433 --> 55:14.436
that if the coward inside of me
swings her fists with her eyes closed,

55:15.103 --> 55:16.479
someone may get hurt.

55:25.947 --> 55:31.119
Maybe I'm not as good a person
as I think I am.

55:32.579 --> 55:33.538
That scares me.

55:47.510 --> 55:48.803
There is no hot water!

55:49.054 --> 55:51.139
Really? What do we do?

55:51.723 --> 55:52.640
Take cold showers?

56:13.328 --> 56:14.370
Hello.

56:14.454 --> 56:16.247
Hello. Five, please.

56:16.623 --> 56:17.999
-How much?
-It's 35,000 won please.

56:18.583 --> 56:20.627
-Hello.
-Thank you.

56:21.586 --> 56:22.879
Hello.

56:24.714 --> 56:25.799
Hello.

56:31.179 --> 56:33.973
-I'm a girl.
-For real?

56:37.477 --> 56:40.021
Eun, do people mistake you often?

56:41.564 --> 56:44.734
Sometimes, older ladies jump
when I walk into the bathroom.

56:45.527 --> 56:46.694
Isn't that a pain?

56:47.403 --> 56:48.321
What can I do?

56:48.863 --> 56:49.864
Try wearing a skirt.

56:50.657 --> 56:51.991
I would look like a cross-dresser.

56:52.575 --> 56:53.743
What if you grow your hair?

56:54.494 --> 56:55.537
It's difficult to maintain.

56:56.871 --> 56:59.040
Doesn't it offend you,
being mistaken for a guy?

57:00.750 --> 57:02.001
I haven't thought about it.

57:02.794 --> 57:04.629
When did you get so close?

57:05.880 --> 57:07.966
Well, we're the same age and all.

57:08.675 --> 57:09.968
I'm more senior in school though.

57:11.928 --> 57:14.389
It's not about the appearance,
but the attitude.

57:14.722 --> 57:17.225
You're always hunched over like this.

57:17.642 --> 57:19.227
Straighten your shoulders.

57:19.519 --> 57:21.938
And walk lightly like this.

57:22.313 --> 57:24.065
-Right? Give it a try.
-Lightly?

57:25.191 --> 57:27.235
-Shoulders back.
-What is that?

57:27.318 --> 57:28.987
She's so stiff!

57:29.154 --> 57:30.738
-Look at that.
-So funny.

57:30.822 --> 57:32.115
-Awesome.
-This is better.

57:32.824 --> 57:35.535
She's a giraffe. Giraffe Cho.

58:15.742 --> 58:19.329
Congratulations. We are happy
to offer you a job in our company.

58:39.182 --> 58:40.016
Mom?

58:43.353 --> 58:44.938
When is Ms. Ha coming?

58:45.522 --> 58:47.232
She'll come when she comes.

58:49.108 --> 58:50.818
Was this always like this?

58:57.033 --> 58:57.867
But you know,

58:59.077 --> 59:01.704
I think it will become harder
for us to meet. Is that okay?

59:06.209 --> 59:07.126
Yes.

59:08.419 --> 59:09.796
I got in.

59:14.342 --> 59:15.718
I want a kiss.

59:17.428 --> 59:18.555
One more time.

59:26.312 --> 59:27.689
When are you coming to Seoul?

59:31.484 --> 59:32.569
No.

59:38.241 --> 59:40.535
Okay. I'll call again soon.

59:45.665 --> 59:46.958
You were here?

59:50.128 --> 59:51.170
I got the job.

59:53.256 --> 59:54.215
Okay.

59:55.758 --> 59:56.676
No congratulations?

59:57.552 --> 59:58.886
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

1:00:01.389 --> 1:00:02.557
What's wrong?

1:00:04.726 --> 1:00:05.810
"No."

1:00:08.896 --> 1:00:11.566
What? Did you think I would speak
in monotone even with my boyfriend?

1:00:12.191 --> 1:00:13.234
-Yes.
-Yes.

1:00:14.527 --> 1:00:17.780
May I kiss you?
Yes, kiss me as much as you want.

1:00:19.407 --> 1:00:20.491
Jin-myung.

1:00:21.701 --> 1:00:23.244
Jin-myung Yoon, Ye-eun Jung

1:00:23.328 --> 1:00:25.330
Ji-won Song, Eun-jae Yoo

1:00:31.085 --> 1:00:37.008
She has a scar on her palm.

1:00:39.552 --> 1:00:43.514
It looks like it was made by a knife.

1:00:57.195 --> 1:01:00.406
Mapo-gu Yeonnam-ro 22, 2nd Floor

1:01:13.711 --> 1:01:16.130
Are you happy? Because of you...

1:01:16.339 --> 1:01:18.132
I'll make you pay for what you did, bitch.

1:01:18.216 --> 1:01:21.761
I won't forgive you. I'll have my revenge.

1:01:21.928 --> 1:01:26.808
I'll kill you.

1:01:26.891 --> 1:01:29.811
I'll kill you.

1:01:43.074 --> 1:01:46.327
-Ye-eun Jung. Is she your prime suspect?
-Ye-eun has changed.

1:01:46.411 --> 1:01:48.871
I heard you were attacked
by your boyfriend.

1:01:48.955 --> 1:01:51.207
I heard you were abducted, too.

1:01:51.290 --> 1:01:53.209
I would rather not talk about it.

1:01:55.336 --> 1:01:56.421
Wait!

1:01:56.504 --> 1:01:58.089
-They broke up.
-Hi.

1:01:58.172 --> 1:02:00.758
The groups were made
by your names in alphabetical order.

1:02:00.842 --> 1:02:03.553
Oh, no. You'll have to see him
until you graduate.

1:02:03.636 --> 1:02:04.721
You can't take time off.

1:02:04.804 --> 1:02:07.140
I'm Jin-myung Yoon
from Management Support team.

1:02:07.390 --> 1:02:09.225
Sorry, but don't talk about me.

1:02:09.308 --> 1:02:11.394
Celebrities have personal lives, too.

1:02:11.477 --> 1:02:13.646
Shouldn't you leave us alone while we eat?

1:02:14.147 --> 1:02:16.357
Who does all of this
to deliver someone else's letter?

1:02:16.441 --> 1:02:18.484
You even moved.

1:02:18.860 --> 1:02:19.694
Is it true?

1:02:19.777 --> 1:02:22.363
That you're more desperate
to sleep with a guy than to get a job.

1:02:22.447 --> 1:02:24.699
I like you. Let's go.

1:02:26.951 --> 1:02:29.495
-Ji-won.
-I need to tell someone,

1:02:29.579 --> 1:02:32.039
but I can't tell people
who are too close to me.

1:02:32.123 --> 1:02:34.375
Because that person will be
just as painful as I am.

1:02:34.500 --> 1:02:36.043
Pretty shoes.

1:03:14.499 --> 1:03:15.416
That's ridiculous.

1:03:22.924 --> 1:03:24.634
My poop weighed 400 grams!

1:03:34.101 --> 1:03:35.186
That's ridiculous.

1:03:36.187 --> 1:03:38.189
