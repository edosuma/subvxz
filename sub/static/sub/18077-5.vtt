00:03.069 --> 00:04.537
What is going on here?

00:04.604 --> 00:07.005
McEwan has blocked us from
getting our lumber to the mill.

00:07.073 --> 00:09.667
Sounds like a bunch of cockroaches
that need to be stepped on.

00:09.743 --> 00:12.474
Pine chigger.
Deadly to trees.

00:12.545 --> 00:14.206
Check on union cards.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.975
This is my union card.

00:17.717 --> 00:21.210
I'm beginning to wonder if I'm really
cut out for this kind of work.

00:23.189 --> 00:25.487
Where's your courage, man?

00:25.558 --> 00:28.493
It hasn't been spotted
in these parts since 1954.

00:28.561 --> 00:30.427
The bigger they are,
the harder they fall.

00:30.864 --> 00:31.854

Bigfoot country.

00:33.466 --> 00:34.592
[screaming]

00:35.702 --> 00:36.794
What you doing, fool?

00:36.970 --> 00:38.301
Let's see if this thing runs.

00:39.305 --> 00:40.295
[honking]

00:41.541 --> 00:42.940
We're burning up, man.

00:43.943 --> 00:45.911
(man) They're coming through.
Hold on.

00:49.449 --> 00:51.816
<i>(male narrator) In 1972,
a crack commando unit...</i>

00:51.885 --> 00:53.546
<i>was sent to prison
by a military court...</i>

00:53.620 --> 00:55.110
<i>for a crime
they didn't commit.</i>

00:55.188 --> 00:56.451
<i>These men promptly escaped...</i>

00:56.523 --> 00:58.150

stockade...</i>

00:58.224 --> 00:59.623

01:01.561 --> 01:03.461

02:59.245 --> 03:01.179
Why don't you let me
drop you off, Samantha?

03:01.247 --> 03:03.443
No way.
We're in this together, John.

03:03.550 --> 03:05.518
Besides, I never back out
of a fight.

03:05.618 --> 03:08.485
Okay. Never could talk
any sense to you anyway.

03:08.655 --> 03:10.180
Besides, I gotta take care
of you.

03:10.290 --> 03:13.021
Well, don't you worry
about me, little sister.

03:13.293 --> 03:15.455
Nothing's gonna happen to me,
I promise you.

03:17.730 --> 03:18.822
[birds chirping]

03:19.499 --> 03:20.660
[truck approaching]

03:39.018 --> 03:41.316
John, that's McEwan's truck.

03:41.854 --> 03:43.117
I don't think we should stop.

03:43.590 --> 03:47.549
It's our last chance to fill up.
Gotta get some gas.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.632
(McEwan)
John Lawrence.

03:54.701 --> 03:56.931
I thought I explained it
very nicely before.

03:57.503 --> 03:59.301
This is a union gas station
now.

03:59.772 --> 04:01.866
It wouldn't be right for a scab
to be using the pumps.

04:01.941 --> 04:04.501
This station's open to the public,
McEwan, and I need a fill up.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.879
Don't see why
you want to fill her up, John.

04:08.514 --> 04:11.142
The only logging done around
here is done by union members.

04:11.551 --> 04:13.679
You mean anyone who's willing
to pay you dues.

04:14.754 --> 04:15.778
[exclaiming]

04:15.855 --> 04:17.482
What a waste of fuel, huh?

04:17.757 --> 04:18.747
[gasping]

04:21.027 --> 04:22.927
Get away from him! Stop it.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.157
What are you guys doing?

04:24.264 --> 04:26.323
Stay out of this, old man.
It's not your fight.

04:26.733 --> 04:28.724
[groaning] Real sorry you
had to see this, ma'am.

04:29.068 --> 04:31.059
But these loggers
got a lot at stake...

04:31.304 --> 04:33.329
and your brother just keeps
getting in the way.

04:33.406 --> 04:35.534
You're gonna kill him.
Stop it!

04:35.608 --> 04:36.769
[grunting]
That's enough.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.437
You can't stop me, McEwan.

04:42.515 --> 04:44.506
I'm real sorry
you feel that way, John.

04:52.925 --> 04:55.257
Guess you're not gonna be
doing too much without a truck.

04:55.395 --> 04:56.419
[panting]

04:56.562 --> 04:57.552
Torch it.

the strength...

05:58.157 --> 05:59.625
I'd like a paper, please.

06:09.635 --> 06:11.899
You gave me too much change.
No, I didn't.

06:11.971 --> 06:13.336
Yes, yes you did.

06:16.542 --> 06:17.771
Yes, I did.

06:18.978 --> 06:21.003
Well, honesty in the big city,
huh?

06:21.247 --> 06:22.510
I just want a paper.

06:22.615 --> 06:24.845
I'd like the one second up
from the bottom, please.

06:24.917 --> 06:26.316
Second from the bottom?

06:27.220 --> 06:29.450
[sighing]
Lady, they're all the same.

06:29.522 --> 06:32.423
Well, perhaps, but I'd like the
one second from the bottom.

06:34.460 --> 06:37.361
Now, today is Thursday,
the...

06:38.030 --> 06:39.623
Twelfth.
The twelfth.

06:40.466 --> 06:43.697
And it says right here,
Thursday, the twelfth.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.101
The twelfth, yeah.

06:45.705 --> 06:49.801
Now this paper is the same
as this paper...

06:50.810 --> 06:52.539
or this paper...

06:52.912 --> 06:57.247
or this paper, or this paper.
Trust me, lady.

06:57.550 --> 06:58.642
Look.

06:58.751 --> 07:01.743
Could I have the paper I asked for?
I'll give you $10 for it.

07:02.288 --> 07:03.517
$10?

07:04.757 --> 07:05.815
[groaning]

07:06.459 --> 07:10.396
You must want that paper
pretty bad.

07:10.696 --> 07:11.686
What's in it?

07:11.764 --> 07:14.461
There's something in there for me.
I was told to get that paper.

07:14.534 --> 07:16.696
Look I have to have
that paper, okay?

07:17.403 --> 07:18.996
$15...
$15...

07:19.071 --> 07:20.470
mm...
mm...

07:20.540 --> 07:23.635
$17, $18.
That's all I have.

07:23.776 --> 07:25.767
Please,
could I have that paper?

07:25.878 --> 07:27.175
$18.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.609
[groaning]
Well...

07:39.258 --> 07:40.248
[grunting]

07:42.261 --> 07:43.353
[sighing]

07:43.429 --> 07:45.830
There you go, lady.
Thank you.

07:54.607 --> 07:57.076
You must need to see us
pretty bad, huh?

07:59.579 --> 08:03.174
So this Bull McEwan wants to organize
a union for all the loggers up there.

08:03.249 --> 08:04.808
McEwan has got
everybody believing...

08:04.884 --> 08:07.945
they can get twice as much money for
their lumber as they've been getting.

08:08.020 --> 08:10.717
All they have to do is join the
union and give him all their dues.

08:10.790 --> 08:14.055
And all they're gonna get for their money
is a lot of empty promises, right?

08:14.126 --> 08:17.391
Well, anyone who stands up to him gets
beaten up and their equipment wrecked.

08:17.463 --> 08:19.056
The police can't do anything
'cause...

08:19.131 --> 08:21.065
there's never any witnesses
that'll testify.

08:21.133 --> 08:23.625
McEwan has blocked us from getting
our lumber to the mill...

08:23.703 --> 08:26.138
and if we can't haul our logs,
we'll be wiped out.

08:26.205 --> 08:29.266
Sounds like a case of a bunch of
cockroaches that need to be stepped on.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.310
Except no one's been able to
do the stepping.

08:31.377 --> 08:33.208
Well, I happen to do
a little trading...

08:33.279 --> 08:35.179
in international lumber
futures and...

08:35.515 --> 08:37.506
since the bottom fell out
of the housing market...

08:37.582 --> 08:39.984
some of these guys are only
getting five cents on the dollar.

08:40.052 --> 08:42.248
Then there's no way for McEwan
<i>to</i> make good <i>on</i> his word.

08:42.321 --> 08:44.949
Oh, if I was just a man. I would
haul off and crack McEwan one...

08:45.024 --> 08:46.185
right across the jaw.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.852
I'm glad you're not a man...

08:48.261 --> 08:49.990
I like you
just the way you are.

08:51.831 --> 08:52.821
Will you help us?

08:52.932 --> 08:54.593
Depends if you can pay
our fee.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.692
If we can get McEwan off
our backs...

08:57.169 --> 08:59.365
we have a good crop of timber
for this year.

08:59.505 --> 09:03.066
We will get the money.
Then we will be there.

09:04.443 --> 09:06.241
(Murdock)
Perkins, Normandy, 1944.

09:06.312 --> 09:08.371
(Face) How long has this man
been talking like this?

09:08.447 --> 09:11.849
Well, I don't know. We never
listen to what Murdock says.

09:11.984 --> 09:13.975
He's been gibbering
for as long as I can remember.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.351
Then why did I get the call
only just this morning?

09:16.422 --> 09:18.618
I didn't know
someone called you.

09:19.158 --> 09:21.252
Look,
to be perfectly honest...

09:21.327 --> 09:23.694
we just don't pay any attention
to what Murdock says.

09:23.763 --> 09:25.697
You don't pay attention?

09:25.865 --> 09:29.165
Well, that seems to be obvious.
Because if you did pay attention...

09:29.235 --> 09:32.068
you'd know this man is a major
threat to our national security.

09:32.138 --> 09:35.574
We were ordered to take
the great ship Leningrad...

09:35.708 --> 09:37.267
16 were killed...

09:37.343 --> 09:40.745
but it wasn't my fault.
Kalyenko knew.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.712
Two of his men were agents.

09:42.782 --> 09:44.341
Look, I don't understand
this...

09:44.417 --> 09:47.352
but you can't just take this patient
out of here without the proper--

09:47.420 --> 09:50.048
The MI-5 chaps knew we were
gonna bomb Haiphong harbor...

09:50.122 --> 09:52.056
[shushing] but their
Secretary put the call in--

09:52.124 --> 09:53.819
If you repeat anything
of what you've heard...

09:53.893 --> 09:56.225
(Face) you'll be in violation
of the National Security Act.

09:56.295 --> 09:57.626
What is going on here?

09:57.697 --> 10:00.166
Nurse Meadows, what is that
patient doing in the hall?

10:00.266 --> 10:02.257
Please, he's with
Military Intelligence.

10:02.335 --> 10:05.430
All right, I want both of you to
go about your business as usual...

10:05.504 --> 10:09.771
as if everything's normal.
Sergeant Heidelberg.

10:10.076 --> 10:13.307
(Murdock) The mission to
Berlin had to be aborted.

10:13.546 --> 10:16.038
The Prime Minister
has the briefing papers--

10:16.148 --> 10:18.378
If you repeat anything
that you have just heard...

10:18.451 --> 10:21.512
you both will be tried and
convicted of sedition and treason.

10:23.556 --> 10:26.423
When did you first enter
this country, Ms. Heidelberg?

10:26.859 --> 10:28.850
I was born here.

10:29.028 --> 10:32.225
You will be contacted, be prepared
to bring proof of citizenship.

10:32.598 --> 10:36.660
Now, you will listen
very carefully.

10:37.203 --> 10:39.331
You will both finish your
shift, clock out, and go home.

10:39.405 --> 10:41.840
If in an hour you don't hear
from me, don't leave the house.

10:41.907 --> 10:43.238
Your phone will ring.
Pick it up.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.539
If the voice on the other end
doesn't say "Thunderball"...

10:45.611 --> 10:47.909
let it ring at least six times
before you pick it up again.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.311
Is that perfectly clear?
But--

10:49.382 --> 10:51.043
There are no buts.

10:51.117 --> 10:53.108
Let's just hope
we have acted in time.

10:53.386 --> 10:54.785
[speaking German]

11:01.894 --> 11:02.884
[birds chirping]

11:09.969 --> 11:11.664
Bigfoot country.

11:12.071 --> 11:14.540
First one who lays an eye
on the hairy guy wins.

11:15.074 --> 11:16.166
What's the prize?

11:16.709 --> 11:19.201
$15 and a year's free
subscription.

11:20.112 --> 11:21.637
It say it right there.
(Face) Swell.

11:21.714 --> 11:24.012
People have been looking for
this missing link for years.

11:24.083 --> 11:28.020
I'm gonna tag this baby and get my name
right up there with Charles Darwin and...

11:28.120 --> 11:31.021
Leo Bell.
Leo Bell? Who's that?

11:31.190 --> 11:32.453
That's the guy
in the room next to me.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.256
He's got a mouth so big he can put a
whole jar of peanut butter in it.

11:35.327 --> 11:36.294
Lid and all.
Really?

11:36.362 --> 11:37.352
Jealous?

11:37.430 --> 11:38.591
[honking]

11:38.998 --> 11:40.193
It's working great.

11:40.399 --> 11:43.425
This Bigfoot mating call's gonna
lead that baby right to me.

11:43.569 --> 11:46.038
There ain't no Bigfoot. It's
just a big story, that's all.

11:46.105 --> 11:49.075
Oh, yeah? Well, when I catch
him, I'm gonna be rich.

11:49.975 --> 11:51.238
[honking]

11:51.444 --> 11:54.175
If you blow that in my face again,
I'm gonna stick it up your nose.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.305
That would hurt.
(Hannibal) Cool it, guys.

11:56.582 --> 11:59.415
Samantha said that no one in
town would sell her supplies.

11:59.618 --> 12:02.212
There should be a gas station-
coffee shop up ahead.

12:02.288 --> 12:04.279
We'll stop and pick up
a couple of things...

12:04.356 --> 12:06.324
and I'll call and let her know
we're in the area.

12:13.432 --> 12:14.957
[van doors closing]

12:25.444 --> 12:27.173
There you go.
Thank you.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.511
Now. Four hundred hamburgers?

12:33.786 --> 12:38.223
If you ran around in the woods all day
in a hair suit, you'd get hungry, too.

12:38.958 --> 12:43.293
Now we lay them burgers
from the forest to my window.

12:43.362 --> 12:46.127
The big guy follows
the trail, and bam!

12:46.232 --> 12:48.701
We catch him munching
on a burger, claim the reward.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.760
Now 'course,
since they're your burgers...

12:52.204 --> 12:55.367
we split that reward
right down the middle.

12:55.674 --> 12:57.972
$7.50 cents each.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.914
Where's your courage, man...

13:03.282 --> 13:04.647
your sense of adventure?

13:04.717 --> 13:08.551
You don't catch a mountain
with a mouse, you know?

13:09.722 --> 13:11.019
Or do you?

13:13.058 --> 13:14.822
Yeah, we're about 10 minutes
away.

13:15.795 --> 13:19.026
Yeah, we're going to pick up a couple
of things. And then we'll be there.

13:19.098 --> 13:20.566
Okay, We-

13:26.238 --> 13:27.603
You friends of the Lawrences?

13:27.807 --> 13:29.275
We're gonna work for them.

13:29.375 --> 13:31.036
I hear they got some logs
to haul.

13:31.377 --> 13:32.811
They got nothing to move.

13:33.112 --> 13:35.479
Around here folks don't work
for the Lawrences.

13:35.548 --> 13:36.538
Oh.

13:37.283 --> 13:38.478
Hey, Face?

13:38.818 --> 13:42.049
Did you see a sign that we passed
saying we're leaving the country?

13:42.121 --> 13:45.147
No can't say I did, Hannibal.
How about you, Murdock?

13:45.291 --> 13:47.316
No, sure didn't.
Well...

13:48.360 --> 13:50.829
that means we're in the
United States of America...

13:51.197 --> 13:53.791
and, as I remember,
it's a free country.

13:54.033 --> 13:57.230
This is a public place.
We can go where we want.

13:57.469 --> 13:59.904
Around here you can't, mister.
You hear me?

14:00.072 --> 14:01.233

14:49.622 --> 14:52.284
Proprietor,
here's for the breakage.

14:53.325 --> 14:54.793
Thanks
for the use of the hall.

14:55.928 --> 14:57.020
[exclaiming]

14:57.096 --> 14:59.394
You think McEwan will know
we were here?

I don't believe this.

15:43.208 --> 15:45.802
You don't wanna scare him away.
Who?

15:45.878 --> 15:46.868
Bigfoot.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.047
I know he's out there.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.849
A fleeting shadow...

15:52.217 --> 15:54.777
the glimmer of a hairy elbow.

15:55.154 --> 15:58.556
The outline of a footprint
in the dew-drenched earth.

15:58.791 --> 16:02.318
The whole overstuffed
enchilada, Bigfoot.

16:02.394 --> 16:06.331
And this is the call
of the big, blond Bigfoot.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.724
Murdock, you're crazy.

Yoo-hoo.

16:27.453 --> 16:30.115
It's 5:00
in the morning.

16:30.189 --> 16:33.022
I thought a soldier like you
was used to getting up early.

16:34.426 --> 16:38.590
I am. As long as I don't have to share a
room with Marlin Perkins over there.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.860
(Face) He kept me up all night
going on and on and on...

16:40.933 --> 16:42.128
about Bigfoot.

16:42.201 --> 16:44.499
No, I see him. He's coming...

16:45.437 --> 16:47.064
I see the beast.

16:47.139 --> 16:48.402
[birds chirping]

16:48.474 --> 16:50.169
He's coming closer...

16:50.442 --> 16:54.140
and closer
and... Oh, it's so horrible!

16:54.213 --> 16:55.339
[screaming]

16:57.483 --> 16:59.918
What you doing, fool?
We got some logging to do.

17:00.152 --> 17:03.247
Yeah. B.A.'s gonna teach me
to be a bad logger.

17:04.123 --> 17:06.819
Bad means good, right?
You got it, little guy.

17:06.892 --> 17:09.156
B.A., do you know
what you've done?

17:09.494 --> 17:13.693
Bigfoot got one look at you and hightailed
it back into the woods to warn his friends.

17:13.766 --> 17:17.669
I wouldn't be surprised if the Bigfoots
didn't even have a reward out after you.

17:17.736 --> 17:19.204
[grunting]

17:29.548 --> 17:30.845
Look at little Billy.

17:30.916 --> 17:34.546
I haven't seen him this happy
since his father passed away.

17:35.521 --> 17:38.616
He has a good lady for a mother.
He's a lucky boy.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.428
Boy, these trees really look a
lot bigger when you get outside.

17:44.596 --> 17:46.564
The bigger they are,
the harder they fall.

17:46.632 --> 17:48.691
You had to use that one,
didn't you, Hannibal?

17:49.168 --> 17:50.795
Face, this won't take long.

17:51.070 --> 17:54.665
McEwan can't afford to have any
logging operation he doesn't control.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.107
If we can get the Lawrences'
logs to the mill, past McEwan...

17:58.177 --> 18:01.374
the other loggers will see it and know
they can stand up to this slimeball.

18:01.447 --> 18:02.812
And it'll put him
out of business.

18:02.981 --> 18:04.642
You're gonna have to
get us a truck...

18:04.716 --> 18:06.684
to replace the one
McEwan torched.

18:07.186 --> 18:08.654
[moaning]

18:09.188 --> 18:10.781
Sawdust and tweed.

18:11.023 --> 18:13.219
My tailor's really gonna love
this one.

18:19.331 --> 18:20.560
[screeching]

18:30.242 --> 18:32.370
So this is the new crew
you hired, John.

18:32.811 --> 18:34.176
That's right, McEwan.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.308
We're going to be hauling logs.
That's good to hear.

18:38.350 --> 18:41.445
We figured we'd just come up
here and check on union cards.

18:42.955 --> 18:43.945
How about you?

18:45.023 --> 18:47.515
You got a union card?
No.

18:48.694 --> 18:49.684
Hey, Face...

18:50.696 --> 18:52.460
you got a union card?
No.

18:52.531 --> 18:54.863
I must have left it back
in my tuxedo.

18:55.501 --> 18:58.163
How about you, B.A.?
This is my union card.

18:58.403 --> 19:00.132
Hey, now easy, fellas.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.165
We came up here nice
and friendly like.

19:03.842 --> 19:07.642
Which is more that I can say the way you
handled yourself at the gas stop yesterday.

19:07.913 --> 19:10.382
We handled ourselves
beautifully at the truck stop.

19:10.482 --> 19:13.008
McEwan, it's more than just taking
the money from these loggers.

19:13.085 --> 19:16.214
You've taken their dreams and you've
twisted 'em till there's nothing left.

19:16.288 --> 19:18.188
That's very poetic.
The lady is right.

19:18.290 --> 19:22.124
You taking these people money and got them
believing you can get more for their lumber.

19:22.194 --> 19:24.686
And you can't and you know it.
You're not a union.

19:24.763 --> 19:28.461
You're just a bunch of goons extorting
money from good, hardworking people.

19:29.535 --> 19:31.196
Now easy, easy.

19:32.037 --> 19:33.300
(McEwan)
You know, Lawrence...

19:33.372 --> 19:36.706
seems to me there's an overdue
mortgage on this place.

19:36.942 --> 19:40.469
And if you don't get your logs to the
mill you're gonna lose your house.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.043
Now that's a real nasty bit
of trouble.

19:45.284 --> 19:48.515
But I got this feeling you're in
for a whole run of nasty trouble.

19:48.887 --> 19:51.413
Well, now that you've said
what you came to say...

19:52.991 --> 19:54.789
get the hell off our property.

19:55.627 --> 19:56.788
Come on.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.633
[car engine starting] He meant what
he said, you know, about trouble.

20:04.970 --> 20:06.233
Yeah, I expect that.

20:07.706 --> 20:08.696
B.A...

20:10.776 --> 20:13.404
stand guard up by the road
by those trees.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.877
Murdock, make a half circle about a
quarter mile and see what you can find.

20:18.917 --> 20:22.148
Face, we still gotta get that truck.
Gotcha.

20:23.722 --> 20:26.054
Hey. Where are you taking me?
To get a truck.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.020
[car approaching]

20:32.564 --> 20:33.622
[tires screeching]

20:40.239 --> 20:41.365
I don't get it.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.101
We stop in the middle
of the forest...

20:43.175 --> 20:47.043
you go digging under a tree, and you
expect us to get a truck with that?

20:47.646 --> 20:50.081
"That," as you call it,
is a prop.

20:50.282 --> 20:54.685
It's the performance
that counts. Shall we?

20:58.390 --> 21:00.449
It's the coloring
that's got me worried.

21:00.525 --> 21:02.584
See, the African variety
has the orange tint.

21:02.661 --> 21:05.130
The Brazilian ones
have the dark brown spots.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.390
Can I help you?

21:06.498 --> 21:09.024
Frank Sullivan. G-10, USFS.

21:10.769 --> 21:14.728
United States Forest Service.
Insecticide Division.

21:14.806 --> 21:17.741
(Face) We could have
a big problem here.

21:18.343 --> 21:19.572
What are you talking about?

21:19.678 --> 21:23.273
I'm talking about the South
American pine chigger.

21:24.616 --> 21:28.075
"South American" what? Pine chigger.
Deadly to trees.

21:28.820 --> 21:32.279
We found a couple of them
crawling around out back.

21:32.691 --> 21:35.490
Must have been in a load of
logs somebody hauled recently.

21:37.429 --> 21:38.726
I rented a truck...

21:38.797 --> 21:41.061
to the Garrison Brothers yesterday.
They was hauling logs.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.362
There you go.

21:42.734 --> 21:45.203
But they weren't pine.
They weren't?

21:45.437 --> 21:47.735
Not pine? Good Lord!

21:47.806 --> 21:49.740
Now they've acquired a taste
for other woods.

21:49.808 --> 21:51.537
You could be wiped out here.

21:51.877 --> 21:53.470
Well, what do we do?

21:53.879 --> 21:56.280
Well, I'm pretty sure these
are the Brazilian variety.

21:56.348 --> 21:57.816
Which, believe me,
is a big relief...

21:57.883 --> 21:59.749
because their bite
usually isn't fatal.

21:59.818 --> 22:00.808
Fatal?

22:00.952 --> 22:04.980
That was the African variety that bit Dr.
Tunis last week, wasn't it?

22:05.123 --> 22:06.181
(Samantha)
I think so.

22:06.458 --> 22:08.893
Of course Dr. Tunis,
he had a bad heart, too.

22:08.960 --> 22:11.520
So there were other factors
involved in his death.

22:11.897 --> 22:15.026
Oh, boy, I sure hope the females
haven't laid their eggs yet...

22:15.100 --> 22:19.037
'cause if they have, we could
be sitting on a time bomb here.

22:19.905 --> 22:23.398
Hey, what're you gonna do? What if
them females already laid their eggs?

22:23.475 --> 22:25.443
The fumigation squad
is out, right?

22:25.510 --> 22:29.504
They're running a few days behind schedule,
so we can't predict when they'll get here.

22:29.581 --> 22:32.209
Wait a minute. You gotta get them out here.
I got trucks to rent.

22:32.284 --> 22:33.911
Well, a week maybe...
At least.

22:33.985 --> 22:35.919
I don't want that truck
on my lot.

22:35.987 --> 22:37.819
See, it's against
department regulations...

22:37.889 --> 22:40.551
to transport a vehicle
suspected of infestation.

22:40.959 --> 22:43.894
On the other hand...
We could save time.

22:43.962 --> 22:45.487
Yes, yes, you could.

22:46.898 --> 22:49.333
Could you sign us
an authorization note, please?

22:52.471 --> 22:53.597
Thank you.

23:07.953 --> 23:09.546
See, what did I tell you?

23:09.621 --> 23:13.990
It's just a combination of
charm, sophistication, finesse.

Works every time.

Sometimes that doesn't always
work on everything.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.493
What do you mean?

23:19.564 --> 23:23.023
Well, sometimes it's best to just be
straightforward and honest with someone.

23:23.802 --> 23:27.329
Well, of course
if that doesn't work...

23:27.406 --> 23:29.170

Yeah.

28:41.953 --> 28:45.548
If we don't get the timber to the mill
by nightfall, we're out of business.

28:45.790 --> 28:48.316
We've only got a couple
of hours to get a new one.

28:48.760 --> 28:51.491
Do you have any idea how much
a thing like that costs?

28:52.597 --> 28:54.497
Oh, I'll bet Face knows
just the guy

28:54.566 --> 28:56.830
who'd loan us the money
to buy one, huh, Face?

28:56.901 --> 28:59.233
Well,
now that you mention it...

29:06.811 --> 29:09.280
And after what happened to
Lawrence and his pals today...

29:10.181 --> 29:12.650
I don't think we're gonna
worry about him anymore.

29:12.717 --> 29:13.707
[chuckling]

29:13.885 --> 29:15.944
They're probably
in the next county by now.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.647
Why don't you tell the boys
it's payday?

29:21.593 --> 29:22.890
[chainsaw buzzing]

29:48.286 --> 29:50.721
I hope you don't mind us
entering without knocking.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.484
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

29:52.557 --> 29:55.652
They looked surprised to see us.
Yeah, I think they are.

29:56.127 --> 29:58.061
You guys don't learn too well,
do you?

29:58.129 --> 30:00.826
On the contrary.
We're very quick studies.

30:01.699 --> 30:04.100
B.A., show these suckers
what happens to people...

30:04.169 --> 30:06.228
(Hannibal) who don't
respect others' property.

30:14.245 --> 30:15.474
Come here, pal.

30:17.982 --> 30:20.451
Now, Face, get the cash.

30:21.820 --> 30:26.519
My friends and I are a little unhappy
watching our backs for fallen trees.

30:26.958 --> 30:28.926
So I got some advice for you.

30:29.027 --> 30:30.017
Pack up...

30:30.929 --> 30:33.398
and move to some other part
of the woods.

30:33.832 --> 30:37.666
That was a very expensive piece of
equipment you blew up, Mr. McEwan.

30:37.735 --> 30:40.227
So I'm sure you'll want
to make a donation, and...

30:40.638 --> 30:43.972
that ought to just about
cover it. Thanks.

30:48.079 --> 30:49.638
Back off, McEwan.

31:05.330 --> 31:07.298
<i>(John) They should be
there in about an hour.</i>

31:07.365 --> 31:08.628
Okay, John.

31:08.733 --> 31:11.759
I'll keep her open for you.
I'll do it for you...

31:11.936 --> 31:14.530
but you can't let McEwan know
I'm helping you.

31:15.139 --> 31:16.504
<i>Okay, thanks.</i>

31:51.542 --> 31:53.271
Just spoke to Claymont.
We're all set.

31:53.344 --> 31:55.745
He'll take the whole load, but
we've got to be there by 2:00.

31:55.813 --> 31:57.178
Good, we're ready to roll.

31:57.248 --> 32:00.513
McEwan'll never let you get through to
the mill. He's gonna try to stop you.

32:00.585 --> 32:03.486
He probably will.
And we'll be ready for him.

32:05.990 --> 32:07.685
You take care of yourself,
now, B.A.

32:08.393 --> 32:12.330
Okay, Billy, you listen to your
mother and don't you worry about B.A.

32:12.497 --> 32:13.931
I'll be back for supper.

32:14.799 --> 32:15.789
[gasping]

32:18.236 --> 32:20.898
[imitating B.A.] Hey, I don't want
you giving any jive to B.A...

32:20.972 --> 32:22.770
'bout that Bigfoot stuff,
you hear?

32:24.442 --> 32:25.500
[B.A. chuckling]

32:28.880 --> 32:30.644
Once you hit the mill,
you'll be safe.

32:30.715 --> 32:32.979
I'd wish you'd let me
make this run with you.

32:33.051 --> 32:35.543
John, you gotta stay here to take
care of Billy and Samantha...

32:35.620 --> 32:37.952
in case McEwan's men
come back this way.

32:38.823 --> 32:40.313
Okay, B.A., let's mount up.

32:46.998 --> 32:49.660
Please, be careful.
You can count on it.

32:50.068 --> 32:53.197
I'm allergic to bullets, especially
those headed in my direction.

32:53.271 --> 32:54.568
So we're moving out.

32:57.542 --> 32:59.374
♪ I'm a lumberjack,
I'm okay ♪

32:59.444 --> 33:01.776
♪ I sleep all night
and I work all day ♪

33:01.846 --> 33:04.076
♪ Wear my clothes
just once a year ♪

33:04.148 --> 33:06.173
♪ Smells real bad
but I don't care ♪

33:06.250 --> 33:08.378
♪ I'm a lumberjack,
that's a fact... ♪

33:10.888 --> 33:11.878
They're rolling.

33:12.223 --> 33:14.351
<i>(McEwan) Comin' by you
in about five minutes.</i>

33:14.425 --> 33:16.757
We're ready for 'em.
They won't get through.

33:17.195 --> 33:18.959
You better make sure
they don't.

33:28.906 --> 33:31.136
It's steering to the left
pretty bad, Hannibal.

33:31.209 --> 33:32.608
(B.A.)
I did what I could...

33:32.744 --> 33:35.213
but with this load, the
steering won't last too long.

33:35.279 --> 33:37.475
Just keep it on the road, B.A.
We'll make it.

33:44.489 --> 33:47.049
Looks like McEwan's put out
the welcome mat.

33:48.226 --> 33:49.489
[gunshots firing]

33:55.533 --> 33:56.523
Hold on.

34:06.677 --> 34:07.906
Nice, B.A.

34:08.946 --> 34:09.936
[screeching]

34:12.949 --> 34:15.009
I could have picked
their teeth with it...

34:15.085 --> 34:17.248
if B.A. had kept
this thing straight.

34:17.321 --> 34:19.755
I don't think it's the best
time to tell him, all right?

34:19.824 --> 34:20.813
Uh-oh.

34:34.572 --> 34:36.335
This is starting
to get interesting.

34:36.407 --> 34:38.466
This fool thing beginning
to heat up, Hannibal.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.248
[car tires screeching]

34:53.690 --> 34:56.717
We're burning up, man. I'll give
'em a little more firepower.

36:26.517 --> 36:27.780
[honking]

36:44.402 --> 36:46.200
You, Claymont?
Yup.

36:47.572 --> 36:49.597
These logs belong
to John Lawrence.

36:49.707 --> 36:52.039
We didn't really think
you'd make it.

36:52.610 --> 36:54.009
You're better than we thought.

36:55.179 --> 36:57.204
(Claymont) Boys. Halt.

36:57.949 --> 37:00.714
Hey, Smith, I'll take that.

37:04.388 --> 37:06.550
You're dead men.
You know that, don't you?

37:06.924 --> 37:08.323
Oh, Colonel.

37:09.894 --> 37:12.226
McEwan, we've got 'em
down here at the lumberyard.

37:12.296 --> 37:14.162
<i>(McEwan) Okay, hold
them till I get there.</i>

37:14.232 --> 37:15.393
(Sven)
We'll take care of them.

37:21.105 --> 37:22.095
[grunting]

37:24.642 --> 37:26.110
There. That'll hold 'em.

37:27.812 --> 37:29.541
And when McEwan gets here...

37:29.614 --> 37:32.345
you guys are gonna be
fertilizer for the trees.

37:33.317 --> 37:34.910
I always had a green thumb.

37:36.020 --> 37:37.181
You know, Hannibal...

37:37.255 --> 37:40.885
I'm beginning to wonder if I'm really
cut out for this kind of work.

37:42.893 --> 37:43.883
[grunting]

37:46.797 --> 37:48.231
I can see it.

37:48.466 --> 37:50.434
The heart starts
a-pumping...

37:50.501 --> 37:52.492
and the adrenalin
starts a-flowing...

37:52.570 --> 37:55.835
and the veins and the muscles
start to swell.

37:56.607 --> 37:57.938
An immovable object...

37:58.009 --> 38:02.207
against an overwhelming,
powerful muscular force.

38:02.680 --> 38:05.672
Go to it, big guy,
you can do it.

38:08.486 --> 38:10.955
Oh, it is a beautiful machine.

38:11.188 --> 38:12.178
Shut up, fool.

38:15.026 --> 38:16.152
[grunting]

38:29.140 --> 38:31.507
You go down,
I'll tell if it hurts.

<i>You fool!</i>

38:39.216 --> 38:40.206
[exclaiming]

38:41.852 --> 38:43.513
Fool, you got the thing
on my ankle.

38:53.464 --> 38:54.454
Thanks.

38:56.667 --> 38:59.466
Now, they've gone to get
McEwan.

39:01.806 --> 39:04.503
We probably got less than an
hour before they get back.

39:05.076 --> 39:06.544
Well,
what's your plan, Colonel?

39:06.844 --> 39:08.039
Artillery, Captain...

39:09.146 --> 39:11.547
we need artillery.

39:14.185 --> 39:18.986
Now, team, what do you think?

39:21.158 --> 39:22.319
Huh? Look at it.

40:50.147 --> 40:51.444
[sawing]

42:04.421 --> 42:06.549
Well, praise the Lord.

42:14.865 --> 42:16.264

44:16.987 --> 44:18.682
The man did try, Hannibal.

44:18.756 --> 44:22.249
Yeah, they always try,
but they never learn.

44:22.626 --> 44:25.288
You see, what they really need
is a plan.

44:30.100 --> 44:31.226
[birds chirping]

44:32.336 --> 44:36.170
You know, it's too bad you've got to go, I
can always use a bunch of good loggers.

44:37.841 --> 44:39.832
With McEwan gone,
you'll get yourself a crew.

44:39.910 --> 44:41.901
All right, found a guy
in Los Angeles...

44:41.979 --> 44:44.209
who says he'll take
all the logs you can give him.

44:44.281 --> 44:47.911
And he'll give you 50 cents a board
foot more than the going rate.

44:48.018 --> 44:49.042
What?
Yeah...

44:49.119 --> 44:51.645
but you gotta be there in 48 hours.
There's the address.

44:51.722 --> 44:52.712
I'll be there.

44:58.696 --> 44:59.686
Hey, B.A.

45:00.364 --> 45:02.389
My tire's flat.
Wanna help me fix it?

45:04.201 --> 45:06.169
Did you eat all your breakfast
this morning?

45:06.236 --> 45:09.695
Yep. And I even took my vitamins so
I can be big and strong like you.

45:10.574 --> 45:11.871
Well, okay, let's go.

45:13.010 --> 45:15.843
It's a long way to L.A., so I
brought you some sandwiches.

45:15.979 --> 45:19.210
Your favorite kind.
My favorite kind?

45:19.450 --> 45:20.940
Ham sandwiches.

45:23.454 --> 45:26.583
Well, this is the most
inexpensive job we've ever had.

45:26.657 --> 45:28.751
No motel bills,
good home-cooked food.

45:28.826 --> 45:32.285
You can put another $15 in that
kitty soon as Bigfoot comes around.

45:32.830 --> 45:36.095
Murdock, I think if you
were gonna catch Bigfoot...

45:36.166 --> 45:37.759
you'd have caught him by now.

45:38.869 --> 45:42.032
We have to leave
in 15 minutes.

45:42.339 --> 45:44.603
But I've got traps
set everywhere, Colonel--

45:47.010 --> 45:50.105
Of course, I mean, if I haven't
gotten him by the time...

45:50.180 --> 45:52.945
we're getting ready to leave, of
course, I'll throw in the towel.

45:53.016 --> 45:54.450
But I've got a feeling.

45:54.718 --> 45:57.688
My sixth sense tells me
that he's near.

45:57.855 --> 45:58.981
[metal clanking]

Bigfoot. I knew I'd get him,
I knew it.

to stay behind in the van?

[Murdock laughing] You dead meat, fool.
I'm gonna kill you.

Let me down, sucker.
I'll get you, Murdock.
