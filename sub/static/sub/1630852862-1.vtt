01:09.551 --> 01:10.718
Hey.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.510
Where are we going?

02:20.678 --> 02:22.510
Kata forbid.
How could you?

02:22.552 --> 02:25.094
Night like this, how couldn't I?

02:25.136 --> 02:28.886
Don't you feel it?
Don't you feel the energy?

02:33.761 --> 02:35.679
You mustn't.

02:35.721 --> 02:38.928
She disagrees.
She's calling.

02:38.970 --> 02:41.094
All sorts of vermin
be hearing that call too.

02:41.136 --> 02:42.594
Nonsense.

02:42.636 --> 02:44.553
Not nonsense.
What happened to Mel?

02:44.595 --> 02:45.553
Smallpox.

02:45.595 --> 02:47.804
That wasn't smallpox.

02:51.136 --> 02:53.679
Something's out there.
That's why Kata...

02:53.721 --> 02:55.261
Hush!

02:59.137 --> 03:00.804
Those expose the soul.

03:00.846 --> 03:02.804
How else can it fly?

03:06.637 --> 03:08.012
Silly girl.

03:08.054 --> 03:10.137
You call what you are.

05:18.014 --> 05:19.848
Oh, fuck!

06:30.225 --> 06:33.683
Happy birthday, Sis.

06:33.725 --> 06:37.808
Aw!
Oh, you didn't have to.

06:37.850 --> 06:39.725
Oh, come on.

06:43.975 --> 06:46.349
Ah!

06:46.391 --> 06:48.726
Mm, mm.

07:05.851 --> 07:08.059
Oh, what a day.

08:17.310 --> 08:19.060
- You okay?
- What?

08:23.311 --> 08:24.935
Never mind.

08:41.352 --> 08:43.226
Hey!

08:43.268 --> 08:45.602
Can you come get me, please?

08:45.644 --> 08:47.602
I'm not feeling well.

08:47.644 --> 08:49.977
Okay.
Sure.

08:50.019 --> 08:51.228
See you soon.

08:54.436 --> 08:56.519
Hey, babe.
How's it goin'?

08:56.561 --> 08:58.144
I'm gonna go pick up Delfi.

08:58.186 --> 09:00.061
Oh, for Christ's sake.

09:00.103 --> 09:01.270
She's not feeling well.

09:01.312 --> 09:03.644
Again?

09:03.686 --> 09:05.977
She's not gonna
take the fuckin' bus?

09:06.019 --> 09:07.644
Don't you see
what's happening here?

09:07.686 --> 09:09.520
Enlighten me.

09:09.562 --> 09:11.312
She's dead weight.

09:14.228 --> 09:16.603
Fuck.

09:41.228 --> 09:43.145
Delfi!

09:43.187 --> 09:44.562
Hello?

09:48.062 --> 09:50.354
Why didn't you
wait for me at the store?

09:50.396 --> 09:52.313
Thanks for coming.

09:52.355 --> 09:54.103
You okay?
You sound a little...

09:54.145 --> 09:55.480
Just tired.

10:01.271 --> 10:02.978
Gonna stop
for some wine and stuff.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.438
I've got friends
coming over later.

10:04.480 --> 10:06.729
I'm tired, Andra.

10:06.770 --> 10:08.688
Oh, pep up.

10:08.730 --> 10:10.646
A little party
is just what you need.

10:13.230 --> 10:14.646
Yeah.

10:28.230 --> 10:30.189
Hey!
Work happening here.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.480
Uh, coming.

10:43.105 --> 10:44.563
Hi. You look awesome.

10:44.605 --> 10:47.604
Thanks.

10:47.646 --> 10:50.231
- You doin' better?
- Oh, yeah.

10:51.522 --> 10:53.231
What was it before?

10:57.231 --> 10:59.272
Tony coming?

10:59.314 --> 11:00.980
Nah, I'm done with him.

11:02.772 --> 11:05.314
Oh, Tony.
Poor Tony.

11:08.481 --> 11:12.147
You never liked him anyways.

11:25.148 --> 11:28.190
Nice job!

11:28.232 --> 11:30.647
I don't know how
I'm gonna survive this class.

11:30.689 --> 11:32.106
Heinz is a nightmare.

11:32.148 --> 11:33.647
I'm actually
enjoying Heinz's class.

11:33.689 --> 11:37.481
- He's such a drag.
- No, I love studying Erikson.

11:37.523 --> 11:39.022
Erikson's old school.

11:39.064 --> 11:40.565
Oh, yeah right!
I don't think so.

11:40.606 --> 11:42.647
I wrote my dissertation
on modern Eriksonian.

11:42.689 --> 11:44.398
And I bet you slayed that.

11:44.440 --> 11:46.523
Yeah, I'm getting
my PhD in the fall.

11:46.565 --> 11:48.106
Oh, at Yale I presume?

11:48.148 --> 11:49.315
San Serra, actually.

11:49.357 --> 11:50.773
- You got in!?
- You got it!?

11:50.814 --> 11:52.481
Oh, just keep it low key, okay?

11:52.523 --> 11:54.148
Andra's going to California!

11:54.190 --> 11:57.148
Shh! No, no, I haven't
decided yet.

11:57.190 --> 11:58.773
Wouldn't take me
very long to decide.

11:58.815 --> 12:00.440
Oh, California?
Like a millisecond.

12:00.482 --> 12:03.231
Shh!
Don't tell anyone, okay?

12:03.273 --> 12:05.690
Ah.
Ooh!

12:19.732 --> 12:21.191
Okay.

12:21.233 --> 12:22.606
Dear, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

12:36.399 --> 12:38.815
"..very limited spots."

12:38.857 --> 12:41.233
"Unfortunately..."

13:06.483 --> 13:08.192
Where are we going?

13:10.483 --> 13:12.317
Kata forbid.
How could you?

13:12.359 --> 13:14.524
Night like this, how couldn't I?

13:21.774 --> 13:24.192
Something's out there.
That's why Kata...

13:24.234 --> 13:25.358
Hush!

13:27.359 --> 13:28.483
You mustn't.

13:28.525 --> 13:31.359
She disagrees.
She's calling.

13:51.484 --> 13:53.817
Delfi, stop!
Stop!

14:15.526 --> 14:18.526
Delfi, talk to me.

14:18.568 --> 14:20.651
Delfi, what the fuck happened?

14:20.693 --> 14:23.526
I'm worried about you.
This feels like two years ago.

14:26.360 --> 14:29.944
Okay, look, I know you've been
struggling with something,

14:29.985 --> 14:32.485
but you really need
to tell me what's going on.

14:35.568 --> 14:37.318
I can't.

14:37.360 --> 14:38.693
Why?

14:45.318 --> 14:46.526
I've been seeing things.

14:52.319 --> 14:54.526
Oh, Delfi, not again.

14:54.568 --> 14:56.526
Why didn't
you tell me it was back?

15:01.361 --> 15:04.319
Okay, listen, Delfi.
We'll go back to therapy.

15:04.361 --> 15:05.859
I know some professors
at the college.

15:05.901 --> 15:07.734
Great people.
All of them.

15:07.776 --> 15:11.486
You'll have your pick, okay?
We'll get you a new doctor.

15:14.611 --> 15:16.694
I have one.

15:16.736 --> 15:17.903
Who?

15:21.694 --> 15:23.861
Often unresolved issues, pain,

15:23.903 --> 15:27.444
fear, regret,
manifest as delusions,

15:27.486 --> 15:29.360
or hallucinations.

15:29.402 --> 15:31.444
If these issues
lie in the subconscious,

15:31.486 --> 15:34.319
hypnosis can be
a window onto them.

15:34.361 --> 15:36.736
So, just relax
while I set things up.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.527
Do you know Forging Mind?

15:45.403 --> 15:47.486
He's a digital artist
from Australia.

15:47.527 --> 15:49.903
Motion art therapy,
meditative visuals,

15:49.945 --> 15:51.278
stuff like that.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.736
Great guy.

16:01.612 --> 16:02.945
So, Delfi.

16:06.945 --> 16:09.403
I want you
to imagine you're a bird...

16:14.946 --> 16:17.445
..flying over
the story of your life.

16:21.362 --> 16:22.863
You're safe in the air.

16:25.612 --> 16:27.445
Nothing can hurt you.

16:30.695 --> 16:32.570
You can see all of your past.

16:42.571 --> 16:44.446
We are one of a kind!

16:51.113 --> 16:53.529
Do you feel safe?

16:53.571 --> 16:54.988
Yes.

17:04.779 --> 17:08.821
I'm going to ask
about your hallucinations now.

17:08.864 --> 17:10.529
When did they begin?

17:13.529 --> 17:14.779
In the womb.

17:18.155 --> 17:20.738
Are they triggered
by anything in particular?

17:23.155 --> 17:24.613
When it comes.

17:26.488 --> 17:30.030
Is "it" something
your mind has constructed?

17:30.072 --> 17:32.447
No.

17:32.489 --> 17:35.822
Where is "it" from then?

17:35.864 --> 17:37.364
What is "it"?

17:41.530 --> 17:46.530
It is...

17:51.572 --> 17:53.572
It's here.

17:55.781 --> 17:57.488
Where?

17:57.530 --> 18:00.613
Touching my hair.

18:00.655 --> 18:01.781
Back!

18:09.697 --> 18:11.198
I'm not equipped to deal

18:11.240 --> 18:12.698
with these types of things.

18:12.740 --> 18:14.823
But I'll refer you
to someone else,

18:14.865 --> 18:16.990
someone very gifted.

18:20.073 --> 18:22.156
Pat Banfi?

18:22.198 --> 18:23.823
She's a spiritualist.

18:29.823 --> 18:32.573
That was just insane.

18:32.615 --> 18:34.073
You're so narrow minded.

18:34.115 --> 18:36.031
No, I'm not, but come on.

18:38.031 --> 18:39.448
I wanna see this Pat.

18:41.115 --> 18:42.699
We're going to a proper doctor.

18:42.741 --> 18:44.073
- Give me Pat's number.
- No, why?

18:44.115 --> 18:46.073
It's just gonna
be more of that bullshit.

18:46.115 --> 18:47.531
Give me her number!

18:47.573 --> 18:50.907
Okay, no, Delfi.
You had an episode.

18:50.949 --> 18:53.239
You're seeing things.
You need proper help.

18:53.281 --> 18:56.531
Please, you need medication.

18:56.573 --> 18:58.824
And that's okay.

18:58.866 --> 19:00.573
Fuck you!

19:03.741 --> 19:05.157
Delfi!

19:33.867 --> 19:35.115
Hello?

19:35.157 --> 19:37.741
Hi, um, Dr. Smith
gave me your number.

19:37.783 --> 19:40.490
It's great to
finally speak to you.

19:40.532 --> 19:42.574
It's not about me.
It's about my sister.

19:42.616 --> 19:44.282
It is about you.

19:44.324 --> 19:45.866
Excuse me?

19:45.908 --> 19:47.991
I know you're scared, Andra.

19:48.033 --> 19:48.991
You should be.

19:49.033 --> 19:50.658
How do you know my name?

19:50.700 --> 19:53.075
I've been expecting this call.

19:53.117 --> 19:55.866
Let me talk you through things.

19:55.908 --> 19:58.033
First, just let me
know who you are.

19:58.075 --> 20:00.825
I know your nights are restless.

20:00.867 --> 20:04.825
You're beginning
to sense a new reality.

20:04.867 --> 20:08.741
One you'll face without Delfi.

20:08.783 --> 20:12.742
Is this some little game
you set up with Dr. Smith?

20:12.783 --> 20:15.033
You've
always been the strong one.

20:15.075 --> 20:17.617
It makes sense for you
to carry the burden now.

20:17.659 --> 20:19.158
What do you mean
"carry the burden?"

20:19.200 --> 20:22.659
My sister is the one who's sick.
I'm trying to help her get well.

20:22.701 --> 20:24.158
There's little time.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.867
You must be prepared
for what's coming.

20:25.909 --> 20:27.200
This is crazy.

20:27.242 --> 20:29.659
I know what's wrong with Delfi,

20:29.701 --> 20:30.992
how she can be saved,

20:31.034 --> 20:33.200
how you're the only
one who can do it.

20:33.242 --> 20:36.201
Please, you must listen to me.

20:36.243 --> 20:39.117
I'm not listening to anything
until you tell me who you are

20:39.159 --> 20:41.659
and how you know
about me and my sister.

20:41.701 --> 20:43.034
A friend.

20:43.076 --> 20:44.701
That's all that's
important for now.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.242
I'm a friend.

20:48.034 --> 20:50.576
Let's try another way.

20:50.618 --> 20:53.659
It's hard because you've
ignored the truth for so long.

20:53.701 --> 20:57.660
But now,
just between us, admit it.

20:57.701 --> 21:02.660
You know she's not sick.
Something does haunt her.

21:09.951 --> 21:11.868
Maybe a few times.

21:11.910 --> 21:13.702
Go on.

21:13.744 --> 21:15.827
I'm not even sure
what I saw.

21:15.869 --> 21:20.284
Or didn't see
what it was.

21:29.160 --> 21:33.285
I was very young.
I'm not even sure.

21:33.327 --> 21:37.827
Um, I'm about seven years old

21:37.869 --> 21:39.410
playing with Delfi.

22:04.995 --> 22:06.661
Did you see?

22:06.703 --> 22:08.202
Okay, can you please
just tell me

22:08.244 --> 22:10.285
what I can do to help my sister?

22:10.327 --> 22:14.119
Until you see,
it'll keep focus on her.

22:14.161 --> 22:15.744
I don't understand.

22:15.786 --> 22:17.285
You will soon.

22:17.327 --> 22:19.203
- Please!
- I'll set a lantern.

22:19.245 --> 22:20.786
A lantern?

22:20.828 --> 22:22.744
What does that
have to do with anything?

22:22.786 --> 22:25.078
The lantern will
lead you there.

22:25.120 --> 22:27.411
You said you were
a friend and we need help.

22:27.453 --> 22:30.119
Delfi's burden
will pass when you see.

22:30.161 --> 22:31.869
Maybe we can meet face-to-face.

22:31.911 --> 22:34.286
We will
meet face-to-face soon enough.

22:34.328 --> 22:38.786
But now,
you must find the lantern.

22:41.828 --> 22:44.828
What?
Oh, shit.

23:27.287 --> 23:28.996
Delfi?

23:56.872 --> 23:58.247
Delfi!?

24:07.038 --> 24:07.996
Delfi?

24:43.330 --> 24:45.581
Oh, my God!

24:45.623 --> 24:48.247
No!
Delfi!

24:48.288 --> 24:51.331
I'm not here.

24:55.248 --> 24:56.956
Delfi! Delfi!

24:56.998 --> 24:58.332
Delfi, stay with me.

24:58.374 --> 25:00.290
Come on.
Come on, Delfi.

25:13.956 --> 25:17.914
- Oh!
- Shh!

25:23.665 --> 25:26.206
- I was trapped.
- Mm-hm.

25:26.248 --> 25:29.247
- It got me.
- It's okay.

25:29.289 --> 25:31.540
Okay? Everything is okay.

25:36.582 --> 25:39.332
You don't understand.

25:39.374 --> 25:41.498
It's gonna keep me forever.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.373
And I'll still be alive.

25:43.415 --> 25:45.415
Oh, Delfi,
you're not making any sense.

25:45.457 --> 25:49.957
No, listen!
No, listen to me!

25:49.999 --> 25:53.207
It's getting closer every night.

25:53.249 --> 25:55.998
It's getting
closer every night.

25:56.040 --> 25:57.874
Last night, tonight.

26:00.666 --> 26:03.374
Tomorrow's a full moon.
It'll get me for sure.

26:07.625 --> 26:10.458
I gotta end it now.

26:11.708 --> 26:12.708
Delfi, no!

26:12.750 --> 26:14.374
You can't stop me!

26:14.416 --> 26:17.040
Under hypnosis you said
it was with you in the womb.

26:17.082 --> 26:18.999
If that's true,
then the connection to you

26:19.041 --> 26:20.374
predates your birth
and killing yourself

26:20.416 --> 26:21.916
won't solve anything!

26:26.750 --> 26:28.916
What am I gonna do?

26:30.958 --> 26:35.708
What am I gonna do?

26:35.750 --> 26:40.916
Shh, shh, shh.

27:17.626 --> 27:20.334
- That smell.
- What smell?

27:24.084 --> 27:25.293
Where did you get this?

27:25.335 --> 27:28.335
A friend gave it to me
from North Bay.

27:41.293 --> 27:43.376
North Bay? North Bay?

27:43.418 --> 27:46.000
Yeah.

27:48.126 --> 27:49.460
Delfi.

28:05.418 --> 28:06.710
I know this place.

28:11.335 --> 28:13.418
Oh, Delfi,
this looks familiar to me too.

28:13.460 --> 28:15.543
You're confusing memories
of when we went to camp

28:15.585 --> 28:17.127
after Mom and Dad died.

28:17.169 --> 28:18.668
No,
it was a different time

28:18.710 --> 28:20.585
before any of this shit
happened to me.

28:20.627 --> 28:23.252
I'm telling you I've been there.

28:23.294 --> 28:25.169
There's a river
with a trail that leads

28:25.211 --> 28:26.419
to a forest of birches.

28:27.544 --> 28:29.461
I've been there.

28:29.503 --> 28:31.294
Okay.

28:34.294 --> 28:36.211
North Bay's only
a couple hours from here.

29:33.795 --> 29:35.795
It's even better
than the picture online.

30:08.920 --> 30:11.338
Oh, wow.

30:14.630 --> 30:15.837
Told you we shoulda come.

30:23.296 --> 30:28.296
There's even tea.

30:52.546 --> 30:54.172
I know you think I'm crazy.

30:55.880 --> 30:58.589
No, Delfi.

30:58.630 --> 31:00.879
I don't think you're crazy.

31:00.921 --> 31:03.464
- Okay?
- Okay.

31:08.714 --> 31:11.422
I do think...

31:11.464 --> 31:14.672
♪ That you're losing
your freakin' mind ♪

31:14.714 --> 31:16.839
♪ And I don't know
where to turn ♪

31:18.047 --> 31:19.547
♪ I keep sayin' ♪

31:19.589 --> 31:21.422
♪ Sayin' I'm fine ♪

31:21.464 --> 31:22.839
♪ Keep sayin' I'm fine ♪

31:22.881 --> 31:25.422
- Ooh.
- ♪ I keep sayin' I'm fine ♪

31:25.464 --> 31:27.214
♪ time ♪

31:27.256 --> 31:30.589
♪ Tryin' to get it together
but my dreams are so... ♪

32:35.798 --> 32:37.840
"Went walking."

35:06.469 --> 35:09.760
Ugh, thanks for waiting.

35:12.802 --> 35:16.677
Oh, Andra!
I was...

35:16.719 --> 35:18.969
Shh!

35:21.636 --> 35:24.969
It was a group of us.

35:25.011 --> 35:28.678
We were witches.

35:28.720 --> 35:31.803
And we had it.

35:31.845 --> 35:34.135
We had the power.

35:34.177 --> 35:37.552
We had the power,
the power of the world.

35:37.594 --> 35:41.011
The power?

35:41.053 --> 35:44.552
Yeah. Don't you feel it?

35:44.594 --> 35:47.095
Don't you feel the energy?

35:47.137 --> 35:48.678
Shh!

35:48.720 --> 35:51.887
Don't you feel it?
Don't you feel the energy?

35:53.636 --> 35:54.803
We mustn't.

36:02.762 --> 36:04.886
And there was...
There was Kata.

36:07.887 --> 36:10.595
And she was our leader.

36:10.637 --> 36:14.511
Kata.
Oh, Kata?

36:14.553 --> 36:16.178
Kata!

36:16.220 --> 36:17.929
- Kata, wait!
- Delfi!

36:17.970 --> 36:20.637
- Kata, it's me!
- Delfi, enough!

36:20.679 --> 36:22.721
- You don't understand!
- No, you don't understand.

36:22.763 --> 36:24.261
We need to go to the hospital.

36:24.303 --> 36:26.303
- I've never felt better!
- You're dissociating.

36:26.345 --> 36:28.637
You need help now or you could
remain delusional.

36:28.679 --> 36:30.137
No, no, this is real!

36:30.179 --> 36:32.679
I can't.
I can't do this anymore!

36:32.721 --> 36:34.179
No, don't be scared.
I'll show you.

36:34.221 --> 36:37.304
- No, I'm going home.
- This is home.

36:37.345 --> 36:38.887
Delfi, I'm sorry.

36:38.929 --> 36:41.179
You can come with me
if you want or not,

36:41.221 --> 36:42.637
but I've gotta go!

36:42.679 --> 36:44.846
No! Come on!

37:49.180 --> 37:50.888
- You see?
- Let's get out of here!

37:50.930 --> 37:52.598
- It's okay.
- We go to the city.

37:52.640 --> 37:54.138
We go straight
to the hospital, okay?

37:54.180 --> 37:56.305
- Okay!
- Okay.

37:56.347 --> 38:00.388
If you still want to.

38:00.430 --> 38:02.263
After I take you somewhere.

38:02.305 --> 38:04.263
No! Delfi, no!
I'm tired. I'm cold.

38:04.305 --> 38:05.973
And I'm getting
really freaked out here!

38:06.015 --> 38:07.388
J-J-Just let me
take you somewhere.

38:07.430 --> 38:09.889
And then I vow,
I promise on our parents' souls,

38:09.931 --> 38:11.723
whatever you say.

38:11.765 --> 38:13.223
- Please.
- Fuck, fine.

38:20.973 --> 38:22.389
Where are you taking me?

38:22.431 --> 38:24.723
To the most
amazing place in the world.

38:24.765 --> 38:26.098
- You'll see.
- Delfi, listen.

38:26.140 --> 38:29.264
I'm not...
I'm not feeling very well.

38:29.306 --> 38:32.139
I think I'm the one
who needs to go to the hospital.

38:32.181 --> 38:34.431
Ah, you're just scared.

38:34.473 --> 38:36.306
I don't know.

38:36.348 --> 38:38.223
I don't know
what to believe anymore.

38:38.265 --> 38:40.682
Sure, you do.
That's why you're scared.

38:40.724 --> 38:42.223
Trust me.

38:42.265 --> 38:44.889
As bad as it gets,
the flip's just as brilliant.

38:44.931 --> 38:46.807
I don't understand.

38:46.849 --> 38:51.181
You will.
As soon as you see this place.

38:51.223 --> 38:54.181
Well, what's
so special about it?

38:54.223 --> 38:56.807
It's where
we used to practice.

38:56.849 --> 38:59.140
A place of power.

38:59.181 --> 39:02.140
A place of power
in downtown North Bay?

39:02.182 --> 39:05.306
We're getting close.
I can feel it.

39:05.348 --> 39:06.765
Shit, Delfi.

39:12.932 --> 39:14.057
Nothing's here.

39:17.016 --> 39:18.807
This is it.

39:18.849 --> 39:20.724
Oh, I'd find it blindfolded.

39:23.307 --> 39:24.849
911.

39:24.891 --> 39:26.390
Hi, we have
a psychiatric emergency.

39:26.432 --> 39:28.349
- One moment, please.
- For fuck's sake, Delfi.

39:38.307 --> 39:41.099
You must find the lantern.

39:44.517 --> 39:45.975
This is just a dream.

39:55.267 --> 39:57.183
Andra!

39:57.225 --> 39:58.516
Andra, look.
Look, look.

39:58.558 --> 40:01.016
See, see? People... people still
come here.

40:01.058 --> 40:02.516
Oh, my gosh.

40:02.558 --> 40:03.891
Imagine.

40:03.933 --> 40:05.975
This, this used
to be all forest.

40:06.017 --> 40:07.308
Okay, okay.

40:07.350 --> 40:09.517
I can't believe
I'm back here!

40:21.017 --> 40:22.850
Isn't it something?

40:31.267 --> 40:34.392
Well, how big is this place?

40:34.434 --> 40:37.017
It doesn't stop.

41:04.394 --> 41:07.101
What's happening here?

41:07.143 --> 41:08.602
Nothing.

41:12.184 --> 41:14.059
You're blushing.

41:14.101 --> 41:16.143
Really?

41:19.852 --> 41:21.142
He's coming over.

41:21.184 --> 41:22.852
Okay.

41:26.101 --> 41:28.477
Okay. So, like,
you know that feeling

41:28.519 --> 41:30.977
when you feel like
you know somebody

41:31.019 --> 41:33.060
but you just met? It's...

41:33.102 --> 41:34.935
I'm Sid.

41:34.977 --> 41:36.477
Andra.

41:36.519 --> 41:39.019
Andra? Nice to meet you.

41:41.519 --> 41:43.518
- Special place.
- Yeah. So I hear.

41:43.560 --> 41:46.102
I was actually in the middle of
backpacking across Canada.

41:46.144 --> 41:48.268
And then, these guys
at the hostel in Toronto

41:48.310 --> 41:50.227
were, like,
"Come check this place out."

41:50.269 --> 41:52.185
And I was, like,
"Yeah, sure. Why not?"

41:52.227 --> 41:56.102
So, I've been here every night
for, like, a week now.

41:56.144 --> 41:57.977
We just arrived yesterday.

41:58.019 --> 41:59.935
Oh. Well, are you staying
in town, or...

41:59.977 --> 42:04.143
A bit out, actually.
Um, it's a really pretty...

42:04.185 --> 42:05.644
You should come check it out.

42:05.686 --> 42:07.227
Fossmill Cabin.

42:07.269 --> 42:09.311
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

42:09.353 --> 42:11.311
I feel like I know you.

42:11.353 --> 42:12.686
Right. Like you do.

42:12.728 --> 42:14.227
Yeah.

42:14.269 --> 42:16.185
Right. See what I mean?
Like, you're just...

42:16.227 --> 42:17.436
- Familiar.
- Yeah.

42:17.478 --> 42:19.103
You're just different.

42:19.144 --> 42:21.436
You probably get that
all the time, though.

42:21.478 --> 42:24.978
I don't, actually. Thanks.

42:31.561 --> 42:32.894
You okay?

42:32.936 --> 42:34.354
Great.

42:36.312 --> 42:38.395
- I can't think straight.
- Oh, my God.

42:39.686 --> 42:42.270
- Oh, this place is alive.
- Yeah.

42:45.020 --> 42:47.270
I want to go there.

42:48.646 --> 42:50.228
- Let's go there.
- Okay.

43:26.438 --> 43:29.438
One. And I am the same.

43:30.646 --> 43:34.646
And I am the same. One.

44:00.105 --> 44:01.521
Andra!

44:14.522 --> 44:16.563
All good?

44:16.605 --> 44:19.356
I...

44:19.398 --> 44:23.105
It's just... Oh, my God.

44:23.147 --> 44:24.481
That was amazing.

44:24.523 --> 44:27.021
I just saw the light.
Did you see it, too?

44:27.063 --> 44:31.647
It was like past, present
and future, all here, right now.

44:31.689 --> 44:35.481
Blake, Rilke, Eckhart,
they tried to capture it.

44:35.523 --> 44:37.272
I'm all in.

44:37.314 --> 44:38.564
I want in.

44:38.606 --> 44:42.356
Okay. Okay, yeah.
I'll take you there.

44:42.398 --> 44:44.147
I've seen where it leads...

44:46.689 --> 44:49.231
...and, wow!

44:56.648 --> 44:58.064
Andra?

44:58.106 --> 44:59.522
Delfi.

44:59.564 --> 45:01.315
No time,.
Thank you for everything.

45:01.357 --> 45:04.357
No. Thank you. Fossmill Cabin!

45:11.440 --> 45:14.273
I was out of it.
I was out of my mind.

45:14.315 --> 45:16.565
Everything was glimmering
and joined.

45:16.607 --> 45:18.273
I felt so free.

45:18.315 --> 45:20.732
I mean, it lasted just a moment,
but it was enough.

45:20.773 --> 45:22.690
Listen, Andra.
I need to talk to you.

45:22.732 --> 45:24.398
I'm worried about you.

45:24.440 --> 45:26.690
Why are you worried?
No, Delfi. I'm finally awake.

45:26.732 --> 45:30.064
I mean, I've seen with my mind.

45:35.357 --> 45:37.357
So beautiful.

45:40.899 --> 45:42.815
Andra? No, Andra.

45:49.774 --> 45:51.108
Andra!

45:51.150 --> 45:54.316
I'm fine. No. It's nothing.

45:54.358 --> 45:56.358
Oh.

46:14.899 --> 46:17.108
Okay. We made it.

46:21.608 --> 46:25.399
Andra?

46:25.441 --> 46:27.441
We need to talk.

46:41.691 --> 46:43.691
I'm serious, Andra.

48:05.902 --> 48:07.902
You came here
looking for answers.

48:12.693 --> 48:16.235
She's got one, maybe two,
days left.

48:16.277 --> 48:17.610
What are you saying?

48:17.652 --> 48:19.236
It got into her.

48:19.278 --> 48:20.526
How?

48:20.568 --> 48:22.943
The same way it got into you.

48:31.860 --> 48:36.402
Darkness and light
are two sides of the same coin.

48:36.444 --> 48:38.486
Forever united.

48:38.528 --> 48:41.569
In some scenarios,

48:41.611 --> 48:46.069
they seep, one into the other.

48:46.111 --> 48:50.736
The light so bright
that it can burn a hole,

48:50.778 --> 48:52.819
as it did in Andra's soul.

48:54.736 --> 48:57.736
That's how it got in.

48:57.778 --> 48:59.903
It traps souls

48:59.945 --> 49:03.652
and stops them from recycling.

49:03.694 --> 49:08.611
But I'm here. How did I recycle?

49:08.653 --> 49:10.569
There's an exorcism.

49:10.611 --> 49:12.611
I performed it.

49:19.487 --> 49:21.487
Perform it on Andra, then.

49:24.362 --> 49:26.362
It requires a sacrifice.

49:27.570 --> 49:29.570
What kind of sacrifice?

49:33.029 --> 49:35.029
I won't let it have her.

49:36.487 --> 49:38.487
What kind of sacrifice?

52:14.990 --> 52:17.156
Shit.

52:28.824 --> 52:32.324
This is a dream.

52:32.365 --> 52:34.532
You said that before.

52:55.199 --> 52:57.199
Andra, wake up.

53:02.116 --> 53:04.116
It's almost 2:00...

53:05.784 --> 53:07.784
...p.m.?

53:16.825 --> 53:18.825
Andra?

53:24.408 --> 53:28.658
Something... Something's wrong...

53:28.700 --> 53:31.658
What?

53:48.909 --> 53:50.909
What?

54:33.410 --> 54:35.702
No, wait. No, wait.

54:35.744 --> 54:38.159
Delfi, we go back.

54:38.201 --> 54:39.409
What?

54:39.451 --> 54:42.910
We go back
to the place of power.

54:42.951 --> 54:46.869
And if I could just
go back to that light...

54:46.911 --> 54:51.409
If I just find that light
and I'll stay there...

54:51.451 --> 54:54.869
I swear. I'll stay
there forever,

54:54.911 --> 54:56.994
and everything will be okay.

54:57.036 --> 54:59.036
Okay?

55:00.952 --> 55:02.119
No, no, no. Please.

55:02.161 --> 55:03.660
It doesn't work like that,
Andra.

55:03.702 --> 55:04.869
It doesn't work
like that.

55:04.911 --> 55:07.161
Please take me back.

55:16.161 --> 55:18.202
Andra?

55:30.369 --> 55:32.452
- Get back.
- Please. You got to let me in.

55:32.494 --> 55:34.327
- Please. You don't understand.
- I said get back.

55:34.369 --> 55:35.994
Why are you sending us away?

55:36.036 --> 55:37.786
- Andra...
- I'm not leaving till I know.

55:37.828 --> 55:39.786
Something foul
was around last night.

55:39.828 --> 55:41.786
I didn't feel like
closing it up.

55:41.828 --> 55:43.452
Tonight, though,
I'm not taking any chances.

55:43.494 --> 55:45.120
Please. You don't understand.

55:45.161 --> 55:47.369
Look. You're not the only ones
I sent away.

55:47.411 --> 55:48.953
It's just this place
exposes people.

55:48.995 --> 55:50.703
Everyone inside
has got to be clean.

55:50.745 --> 55:52.245
Well, I'm a good person!

55:52.287 --> 55:54.452
Good people catch bad things
all the time.

55:54.494 --> 55:56.161
That's why I can't have you
here.

55:56.203 --> 55:58.911
Well, fuck you!
Fuck you, you fucking prick.

55:58.953 --> 56:00.745
You should have been here
yesterday.

56:00.787 --> 56:02.787
Where the hell
were you yesterday?

56:06.538 --> 56:07.870
Oh, fuck that place!

56:07.912 --> 56:10.537
Hey, hey, hey. What's going on?

56:10.579 --> 56:14.286
Last night, something
infected me. I don't know.

56:14.328 --> 56:15.496
Breathe, breathe.

56:15.538 --> 56:16.870
Everything you're going through,

56:16.912 --> 56:18.496
it's just side effects,
all right?

56:18.538 --> 56:21.203
There's a name for it.
It's called kundalini.

56:21.245 --> 56:24.078
Look at this!

56:24.120 --> 56:26.746
This look like fucking
kundalini bullshit to you?

56:26.788 --> 56:28.036
I mean, fuck.

56:28.078 --> 56:29.829
- You should go to a hospital.
- No.

56:29.871 --> 56:32.079
Come on.
We'll all go to the hospital.

56:32.120 --> 56:33.871
Andra, Andra.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

56:33.913 --> 56:37.037
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Andra, Andra. Hold my hand.

56:37.079 --> 56:39.163
I'll fucking kill you!

56:55.497 --> 56:58.079
We're almost there.

57:32.539 --> 57:34.247
Andra, it's going to be
all right.

57:34.289 --> 57:35.455
Shut the fuck up.

57:35.497 --> 57:37.580
I promise I won't let it
get to you.

57:37.622 --> 57:39.830
Get out of my face!

57:49.498 --> 57:51.498
Andra!

57:57.289 --> 58:00.163
- I know you're here.
- Andra!

58:00.205 --> 58:03.205
Come on, you fuck. Show your
fucking disgusting face!

58:04.665 --> 58:07.997
Andra, Andra?

58:10.915 --> 58:12.873
Andra, open up.

58:18.372 --> 58:20.414
Andra?

58:25.456 --> 58:27.998
Andra, no! No.

58:28.040 --> 58:31.040
Andra! Shit.

58:40.582 --> 58:42.624
She didn't mean it.

58:42.666 --> 58:45.873
Over here.

58:57.582 --> 58:59.916
It's me you're hearing.

59:01.582 --> 59:04.582
Come. Let's talk.

59:28.749 --> 59:31.583
Andra is in bad trouble.

59:31.625 --> 59:33.500
Everything she said is true.

59:35.333 --> 59:37.333
Go to her right now.

59:37.375 --> 59:39.040
She said she'd kill me.

59:39.082 --> 59:44.040
A declaration of undying love.

59:44.082 --> 59:46.082
I can't believe that.

59:49.124 --> 59:51.124
Go get her now.

59:54.124 --> 59:57.250
No. This is bullshit, okay?

59:57.292 --> 01:00:01.166
I've seen,
in a dream of a dream,

01:00:01.208 --> 01:00:02.708
you and her intertwined.

01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:05.458
Many hundreds of years past...

01:00:07.542 --> 01:00:10.208
And many more to come.

01:00:18.125 --> 01:00:19.667
Go to her right now.

01:00:45.418 --> 01:00:47.418
Andra?

01:01:25.294 --> 01:01:27.168
Andra?

01:01:30.419 --> 01:01:35.210
Flee the light.

01:01:35.252 --> 01:01:39.335
It hunts in the light.

01:01:41.377 --> 01:01:43.085
Breathe!

01:03:18.296 --> 01:03:20.504
Remember when we met?

01:03:28.837 --> 01:03:30.297
Look.

01:03:31.671 --> 01:03:34.587
I won't.

01:03:34.629 --> 01:03:36.920
Look.

01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:48.630
Let's start again, then.

01:03:55.921 --> 01:03:58.421
Fight it, Andra.
You can control it.

01:03:58.463 --> 01:04:00.005
Run.

01:04:00.047 --> 01:04:01.421
Run.

01:04:01.463 --> 01:04:02.713
Control it.

01:04:06.547 --> 01:04:08.963
Andra?

01:04:09.005 --> 01:04:10.505
No!

01:04:12.005 --> 01:04:14.463
See you soon.

01:05:02.673 --> 01:05:04.673
Hello?

01:05:09.548 --> 01:05:11.299
Is anyone in here?

01:05:17.132 --> 01:05:19.424
Is anyone in here?

01:05:30.881 --> 01:05:32.424
Andra?

01:05:56.133 --> 01:05:59.008
Now, come.

01:06:00.757 --> 01:06:02.840
Come to me.

01:06:14.674 --> 01:06:16.341
Whoa. No, no, no.

01:06:19.050 --> 01:06:21.840
Andra, I want to help you.
I need you...

01:06:24.133 --> 01:06:26.050
...to help me.

01:07:14.092 --> 01:07:15.926
I won't let it have her.

01:07:17.092 --> 01:07:19.426
It requires a sacrifice.

01:07:21.968 --> 01:07:24.801
What kind of sacrifice?

01:07:35.717 --> 01:07:37.717
I've got to make this right.

01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:44.550
Stay with her.

01:07:44.592 --> 01:07:46.676
Tell her I'm sorry.

01:08:07.718 --> 01:08:09.551
Just breathe.

01:08:09.593 --> 01:08:12.802
Breathe. Focus on me.
Focus on my voice. Focus on me.

01:08:12.844 --> 01:08:15.093
Oh, no, Delfi!

01:08:15.135 --> 01:08:17.761
Delfi went to get help.
She's fine.

01:08:17.803 --> 01:08:19.803
She's fine, okay?

01:08:25.136 --> 01:08:27.969
Breathe, Andra, Andra.

01:08:28.011 --> 01:08:30.468
Focus on my voice.
Focus on my voice.

01:08:38.635 --> 01:08:40.969
Andra! Stay focused
on me. Focus on my voice, okay?

01:08:42.676 --> 01:08:44.926
Breathe, breathe.
Andra? Andra, breathe.

01:08:46.178 --> 01:08:48.844
Andra, breathe. Breathe.
Come on.

01:08:48.886 --> 01:08:51.053
Andra, Andra!

01:08:59.804 --> 01:09:02.176
Breathe, Andra. Andra.

01:09:02.219 --> 01:09:04.720
Andra, stay focused on me.

01:09:16.804 --> 01:09:21.053
Come on. I'm here.

01:09:22.929 --> 01:09:25.011
Just breathe.
It's going to be fine.

01:09:32.678 --> 01:09:34.886
Come and get me.

01:09:36.345 --> 01:09:38.178
Fight it. Fight it!

01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:39.845
Fight it.

01:09:39.886 --> 01:09:41.679
Fight it!

01:10:59.306 --> 01:11:00.889
Delfi!

01:11:57.473 --> 01:12:00.807
No, it doesn't matter.
You're okay.

01:12:14.973 --> 01:12:16.390
No!

01:12:27.432 --> 01:12:29.348
. You're okay.

01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:31.849
You're okay.
I got you. I got you.

01:12:31.891 --> 01:12:34.516
I got you. You're okay.

01:12:40.515 --> 01:12:42.390
Andra.

01:12:42.432 --> 01:12:44.016
Oh, Delfi.

01:12:44.058 --> 01:12:45.224
What?

01:12:45.266 --> 01:12:47.266
Delfi is gone.

01:13:23.975 --> 01:13:26.474
You sure you don't want me
to come with you?

01:13:28.642 --> 01:13:30.809
I'll be fine.

01:13:48.601 --> 01:13:49.975
Pat?

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:16.101
I just can't get these images
out of my head.

01:14:16.143 --> 01:14:18.976
Delfi trapped

01:14:19.018 --> 01:14:21.934
in that evil dimension

01:14:21.976 --> 01:14:23.851
with all that light
sucked out of her.

01:14:23.893 --> 01:14:25.893
That didn't happen to her.

01:14:27.685 --> 01:14:30.851
She's one of the lucky ones,
and you saved her.

01:14:35.185 --> 01:14:38.268
No. She gave her life
to save me.

01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:40.101
She gave her life, yes.

01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:43.934
But she saved her soul, which is
what the darkness wanted.

01:14:43.976 --> 01:14:46.519
Her beautiful, mischievous soul.

01:14:46.561 --> 01:14:48.519
However, thanks to you,

01:14:48.561 --> 01:14:51.561
it now has a new interest.

01:14:57.477 --> 01:15:00.519
That burden you mentioned
when we first talked?

01:15:00.561 --> 01:15:02.644
It fixates on the last soul
to escape it,

01:15:02.686 --> 01:15:05.061
as it did with Delfi
and those before her.

01:15:10.561 --> 01:15:13.644
How long has this cycle
been going on?

01:15:13.686 --> 01:15:15.644
Since there's been light,

01:15:15.686 --> 01:15:17.894
there's been darkness.

01:15:22.269 --> 01:15:26.019
And now, I'm its latest target?

01:15:26.061 --> 01:15:28.561
Yes.

01:15:28.603 --> 01:15:30.269
However, it's not all hopeless.

01:15:30.311 --> 01:15:32.227
I can teach you ways
to be vigilant

01:15:32.269 --> 01:15:34.269
and to protect yourself.

01:15:36.186 --> 01:15:40.144
It'll be hard, but you must find
the balance.

01:15:40.186 --> 01:15:42.603
Elude the darkness,

01:15:42.645 --> 01:15:46.020
but keep it close enough
that it can't hunt others.

01:15:46.061 --> 01:15:50.062
That's the trick.

01:15:54.478 --> 01:15:56.145
It's a hell of a burden.

01:15:56.187 --> 01:15:58.145
But a noble one.

01:15:58.187 --> 01:16:01.270
You're quite strong, Andra.

01:16:01.312 --> 01:16:03.436
It's very possible
that you could survive

01:16:03.478 --> 01:16:05.478
with the darkness...

01:16:07.062 --> 01:16:09.396
...forever.

01:16:13.228 --> 01:16:15.228
Forever?
