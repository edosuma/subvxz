04:00.042 --> 04:02.382
Well, he's on the hook.

04:02.500 --> 04:05.170
- Do we let him go?
- No. Teach him a lesson.

04:05.292 --> 04:07.082
Yeah. Blow his mind.

04:07.208 --> 04:08.668
- Yeah.
- Abby?

04:10.208 --> 04:11.918
Are you game?

04:12.042 --> 04:13.632
Why not?

04:32.083 --> 04:34.213
Aghh!

04:54.875 --> 04:56.825
Hello, little green friend.

04:58.167 --> 05:00.037
Gently there.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
- I won't hurt you.
- Tom, what are you doing?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.420
Tom! Are you all right?

05:10.833 --> 05:12.333
Tom, you're not human!

05:14.083 --> 05:15.833
I'm sorry, but...

05:16.750 --> 05:19.040
But sometimes
i just don't understand you!

05:19.167 --> 05:23.207
One minute you want to make love to me,
the next you don't even notice I'm there!

05:23.333 --> 05:24.923
Sometimes you scare me.

05:25.042 --> 05:27.132
It's not me that scares you.

05:28.583 --> 05:30.423
It's the world.

05:31.417 --> 05:33.327
Let's get out of it, Abby.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.118
Let's cross over.

05:35.250 --> 05:36.830
Cross over?

05:36.958 --> 05:40.538
- To the other side.
- How do we do that?

05:41.750 --> 05:43.790
We kill ourselves.

05:43.917 --> 05:47.747
- Oh, tom. Not that again.
- Yes.

05:49.583 --> 05:52.423
- I'm sorry, but I can't.
- Why not?

05:52.542 --> 05:54.542
Well, I promised...

05:54.625 --> 05:58.325
I promised my mother I'd help her
go shopping in the morning.

06:04.250 --> 06:06.080
Besides...

06:07.125 --> 06:08.995
We'd miss all this.

06:11.083 --> 06:13.253
But we'll come back.

06:13.375 --> 06:15.415
It'll be even better.

07:02.792 --> 07:05.292
You mustn't cry, mummy.

07:05.417 --> 07:07.417
No, darling.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.710
I'm sorry. I'll try.

07:10.833 --> 07:12.543
I'm happy here.

07:12.625 --> 07:15.125
I miss you all, of course.

07:15.250 --> 07:18.580
But, mummy, you mustn't be sad for me.

07:18.667 --> 07:20.417
It's so lovely.

07:21.417 --> 07:23.667
I couldn't be happier.

07:32.292 --> 07:34.132
May we ask her...

07:58.458 --> 08:00.998
Over 100 years old.

08:02.708 --> 08:04.578
Maximus leopardus, isn't it?

08:04.667 --> 08:07.077
Yes, the tree-climbing variety.

08:07.208 --> 08:09.828
So very rare now.

08:09.958 --> 08:12.958
They're usually only found in graveyards.

08:14.625 --> 08:16.375
That's right.

08:17.875 --> 08:21.785
Anyone taking a Maximus leopardus
from a graveyard

08:21.917 --> 08:24.667
is either foolhardy or ignorant.

08:25.625 --> 08:29.875
You're always saying I'm foolhardy.
But I'm not ignorant, shadwell.

08:33.332 --> 08:35.082
Except about certain things.

08:37.332 --> 08:40.462
Three things. So answer me.

08:43.082 --> 08:46.083
Why did my father die
in that locked room?

08:50.875 --> 08:53.325
Why do you never get any older,
shadwell?

08:55.917 --> 08:58.917
And what is the secret
of the living dead?

09:00.458 --> 09:03.208
Why do you ask me these questions?

09:05.958 --> 09:10.118
You have already decided to force
an answer out of your mother tonight.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.210
I have to go now.

09:13.208 --> 09:15.538
- Goodbye, mummy.
- Bye, darling.

09:15.625 --> 09:17.245
- Daddy.
- Goodbye, susie.

09:17.375 --> 09:18.915
- Granny.
- Goodbye, lovely.

09:19.042 --> 09:20.882
- Grandfather.
- Goodbye, baby.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.710
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

09:22.833 --> 09:24.623
Goodbye.

09:26.250 --> 09:28.460
- Mrs latham?
- Are you all right, mrs latham?

09:29.958 --> 09:31.708
Do you mind?

09:40.333 --> 09:42.173
Rest now.

09:44.333 --> 09:48.833
Now... relax and start to breathe deeply.

09:56.042 --> 09:57.712
Rest.

09:58.500 --> 10:02.210
You're going to go into
a nice deep sleep.

10:03.375 --> 10:06.375
A deep, deep sleep.

10:08.750 --> 10:11.380
Wasn't she wonderful?

10:11.500 --> 10:14.170
Do you think we can go orjust wait?

10:14.292 --> 10:15.962
I'll speak to him.

10:16.083 --> 10:20.043
I, er, understand that mrs latham
never accepts any payment.

10:20.167 --> 10:23.327
No, we're only servants
of a greater power.

10:23.458 --> 10:26.288
- There's a present we'd like her to have.
- No, thank you.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.247
It's been in our family for generations.

10:34.042 --> 10:36.542
- No, thank you.
- Please!

10:36.625 --> 10:38.245
- No!
- I insist.

10:38.375 --> 10:41.705
- You must take it.
- Get out! Get out! All of you!

10:44.708 --> 10:47.118
- I'm sorry if I'm upsetting you.
- Get out!

11:12.250 --> 11:14.830
In you go, little green friend.

11:23.458 --> 11:25.418
Hello, darling.

11:26.875 --> 11:28.535
Good evening, mother.

11:32.167 --> 11:34.577
I hear it went very well tonight.

11:34.667 --> 11:38.077
Yes, it did. All except for one thing.

11:43.042 --> 11:45.462
I had a telephone call from the police.

11:46.208 --> 11:49.208
The word, mother, is fuzz.

11:50.042 --> 11:53.332
I don't know what you and your gang
of delinquents have been up to,

11:53.458 --> 11:56.458
but if you get into any more trouble,
you're going to be arrested.

11:56.583 --> 11:59.423
The word, mother, is busted.

12:00.667 --> 12:03.917
Oh, tom. Tom!

12:04.917 --> 12:07.127
You're up to something, aren't you?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.080
Everybody dies, don't they?

12:12.208 --> 12:14.248
But some come back.

12:15.333 --> 12:16.713
Isn't that so?

12:16.833 --> 12:19.583
You tried to get into
the locked room today, didn't you?

12:19.708 --> 12:23.418
How do the dead come back, mother?
What's the secret?

12:25.208 --> 12:28.828
Oh, tom, don't go on with this.

12:28.958 --> 12:31.038
You don't know enough.

12:31.167 --> 12:35.127
That room's been locked for 18 years.

12:35.250 --> 12:38.170
And my father's been dead for 18 years.

12:38.292 --> 12:41.252
You know why the fuzz called, mother?

12:42.917 --> 12:44.917
We blew a fellow's mind.

12:45.042 --> 12:46.882
It was beautiful.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.880
Should've been there.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.420
He went right through the windscreen.

12:52.292 --> 12:55.332
It was great fun.

12:55.458 --> 12:59.078
But just you wait till you hear what
we've got planned for tomorrow night.

12:59.208 --> 13:01.208
You're threatening me, aren't you?

13:01.333 --> 13:05.213
You want me to behave, mother?
Then give me the secret.

13:09.333 --> 13:11.543
I think we should give him the key.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.170
We can't.

13:15.417 --> 13:17.827
That room could destroy him.

13:17.958 --> 13:20.078
Not with this protection.

13:28.375 --> 13:31.745
- Will the room give me the secret?
- It may.

13:33.333 --> 13:35.373
It depends on you.

13:36.375 --> 13:37.875
On what you are.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.710
If you're afraid,
we won't think any less of you.

13:51.417 --> 13:53.627
I'm not chickening out, shadwell.

15:29.958 --> 15:32.038
Shadwell!

15:33.083 --> 15:34.673
Mother!

20:15.708 --> 20:18.578
Oh! My poor boy!

20:19.500 --> 20:22.670
Pulse is a bit slow,
but that's quite usual in shock.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.420
Oh, no.

20:28.375 --> 20:30.665
His father's glasses.

20:35.250 --> 20:37.630
If only he'd had more courage.

20:39.083 --> 20:42.373
If he'd had more courage,
he'd be with you now.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.170
I warned him.

20:44.292 --> 20:46.462
I said, "Charles, don't try.

20:46.583 --> 20:48.423
"Don't cross over.

20:48.542 --> 20:50.922
"You haven't got the faith to come back."

20:52.000 --> 20:54.500
At the last moment,
he must've had doubts.

20:56.250 --> 20:58.830
I said, "when you die,

20:58.958 --> 21:02.038
"you've got to believe
that you're going to come back.

21:02.917 --> 21:06.627
"You've got to believe that
with all your being."

21:06.750 --> 21:08.170
Thank you, mother.

21:09.458 --> 21:11.918
Thank you very much.

21:46.833 --> 21:49.293
- What do we do now, then?
- I don't know.

21:49.417 --> 21:52.417
What's the fastest anybody's done
on the motorway?

21:52.542 --> 21:55.212
- 95.
- And then you woke up!

21:55.333 --> 21:57.753
You must be dreaming,
out of your cotton-picking mind!

21:57.875 --> 21:59.955
Today we do the ton.

22:03.458 --> 22:05.788
- And hold it.
- But that's suicide.

22:05.917 --> 22:07.497
So?

22:11.833 --> 22:15.333
Well, hell, you've gotta go some time.
Which way, tom?

22:15.458 --> 22:18.078
Through the town first, I think.

23:31.375 --> 23:33.245
What are you doing?

23:38.708 --> 23:40.328
' - Oh!

23:45.833 --> 23:46.923
Get out!

23:50.292 --> 23:52.042
Fred!

23:55.500 --> 23:58.210
Hey, it's terrible weather.

24:03.917 --> 24:05.827
Timber!

24:10.292 --> 24:12.212
Ice cream? Cornet?

24:16.250 --> 24:18.830
On!

24:40.333 --> 24:42.173
Down there, constable!

24:52.542 --> 24:54.712
Constable,
what are you gonna do about my...

25:39.958 --> 25:42.868
Come on, get out of here!

26:20.708 --> 26:23.498
Whey-hey!

27:34.083 --> 27:35.713
Aghh!

27:40.250 --> 27:41.580
Ohh.

27:54.292 --> 27:56.752
Tom, you'll kill yourself!

27:56.875 --> 27:59.495
I'll try. Off the bridge!

28:00.875 --> 28:02.995
Tom, please, don't!

28:04.000 --> 28:07.380
I'll going! See you around!

28:38.875 --> 28:40.575
Oh, look!

28:58.917 --> 29:02.537
- I'm Abby holman.
- Mrs latham is expecting you.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.330
Miss Abby holman, madam.

29:19.333 --> 29:21.793
So you're tom's girlfriend.

29:21.917 --> 29:23.827
I hope you didn't mind
my asking to see you.

29:24.958 --> 29:26.958
Won't you sit down?

29:29.958 --> 29:33.288
You're not at all what I... expected.

29:34.917 --> 29:37.457
I mean, you're... you're wearing a dress.

29:38.792 --> 29:41.132
You're probably wondering
why I came here.

29:42.708 --> 29:45.578
You were with him when it happened,
weren't you?

29:45.708 --> 29:46.958
Yes.

29:52.750 --> 29:54.710
Tell me...

29:54.833 --> 29:56.713
Was it an accident?

30:01.375 --> 30:03.745
Don't you know or...

30:03.875 --> 30:06.125
Or don't you want to tell me?

30:07.250 --> 30:08.750
It wasn't an accident.

30:08.875 --> 30:10.825
He killed himself.

30:10.958 --> 30:12.368
Yes.

30:12.500 --> 30:14.630
Mrs latham,

30:14.750 --> 30:17.080
why would tom want to kill himself?

30:22.417 --> 30:25.167
- Sherry?
- No, thank you.

30:34.917 --> 30:36.787
Thank you, shadwell.

30:38.167 --> 30:41.037
Now, what did you want to see me about,
Abby?

30:41.167 --> 30:43.577
Well, this may sound strange,

30:43.708 --> 30:46.118
but we'd like to bury tom in our own way.

30:47.833 --> 30:51.673
- What do you think, shadwell?
- Well, it's a little unusual, madam.

30:51.792 --> 30:54.582
But I think
it's what tom would've wanted.

31:02.542 --> 31:04.462
Very well.

31:08.125 --> 31:09.915
Where will you bury him?

31:10.042 --> 31:12.922
- Down at the seven witches.
- Oh. Good.

31:17.625 --> 31:19.825
You know the legend?

31:19.958 --> 31:24.458
Yes, erm, witches were supposed to have
been turned into stone, weren't they?

31:24.583 --> 31:29.083
Yes. You see, they broke a bargain
that they'd made with superior powers.

31:29.875 --> 31:31.875
They had to be punished.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.830
Good day, miss holman.

31:55.292 --> 31:57.632
He's coming back, isn't he?

31:57.750 --> 31:59.580
Yes.

31:59.708 --> 32:01.668
Do you want him back?

32:09.083 --> 32:11.673
Yes, god help me, I do.

He works for tom's mother.

Excellent.

36:15.083 --> 36:18.373

36:30.167 --> 36:32.577

38:28.292 --> 38:32.082
Cut across the seven witches,
it'll save you ten minutes.

38:35.583 --> 38:37.503
You're not afraid, are you?

39:53.333 --> 39:54.713
No, please!

40:11.292 --> 40:13.542
Right, that'll be 66.

40:20.500 --> 40:22.170
Now, look,

40:22.292 --> 40:24.832
I'm sick of you ton-up boys
trying that trick on me.

40:24.958 --> 40:27.918
Now, you pay up or else.

40:28.042 --> 40:30.292
What are you gonna do, kill me?

40:30.417 --> 40:33.457
I'll teach you a lesson,
you long-haired git!

40:36.667 --> 40:40.247
I don't have to take that sort of talk
any more. Not from anybody.

40:55.208 --> 40:58.538
- You got a phone?
- Yeah. We sell beer, too.

40:58.625 --> 41:01.575
Ok. I'll try a pint.

41:16.958 --> 41:19.328
- Where's the phone, then?
- Round the corner.

41:31.875 --> 41:33.455
- Hello.
- Hello.

41:33.583 --> 41:36.753
- Got any change for the phone?
- Help yourself, love.

41:44.125 --> 41:47.455
- Why did you do that?
- I'm just buying a ride on his bike.

41:56.583 --> 41:59.173
Shadwell,
i don't want to see anyone tonight.

41:59.292 --> 42:00.882
Very good, madam.

42:03.958 --> 42:06.618
Latham manor. Shadwell here.

42:06.750 --> 42:09.420
Hello, shadwell.

42:09.542 --> 42:11.502
Good evening, tom.

42:12.292 --> 42:15.422
- 'I made it, shadwell.'
- We all knew you would.

42:15.542 --> 42:17.712
'How does it feel to be back?'

42:17.833 --> 42:20.543
splendid. Enjoying every minute.

42:22.375 --> 42:24.415
'Ls my mother there?'

42:29.542 --> 42:31.792
- hello, tom.
- Hello, darling.

42:31.917 --> 42:33.877
How are you? Are you all right?

42:34.000 --> 42:38.500
Well, I'm, er, dead, mother.
But apart from that, I couldn't be better.

42:38.667 --> 42:40.417
Am I going to see you?

42:41.792 --> 42:44.382
I've got one or two things
I'd like to do.

42:44.500 --> 42:48.500
But I'll try and pop around some time.
Goodbye, mother.

42:54.750 --> 42:57.330
- That'll be 16.
- This one's on the house.

43:02.500 --> 43:04.790
I said 16, Sonny!

43:13.458 --> 43:15.208
He's with me.

43:16.250 --> 43:18.920
That's right. Yes.

43:23.792 --> 43:26.382
Yes, well, thanks very much. Ta-ra, love.

43:26.500 --> 43:28.750
Hey! I thought we were going somewhere.

43:28.875 --> 43:31.995
No, I'm sorry, love,
I've gotta go somewhere special tonight.

43:32.125 --> 43:34.955
Oh. I'm not classy enough,
is that what you're saying?

43:35.083 --> 43:37.623
No, I didn't mean that at all.

43:37.750 --> 43:40.420
What about my money?
That was good enough for you.

43:40.542 --> 43:42.582
Sure. And I'm very grateful.

43:42.667 --> 43:45.417
It's just that
i can't take you anywhere tonight.

43:47.750 --> 43:49.790
I'm coming for a ride.

43:49.917 --> 43:53.827
Look, I'm not going to argue.
Just be a good girl and get off the bike.

43:53.958 --> 43:55.958
No. I'm staying.

43:58.292 --> 43:59.582
You silly little fool!

44:05.042 --> 44:07.582
For god's sake, get the police, quick!

44:20.042 --> 44:23.172
Evening, inspector.
Sorry to interrupt your card game.

44:23.292 --> 44:25.832
It's all right, sergeant.
I was losing anyway.

44:25.958 --> 44:28.828
- Stand aside, please. Thank you.
- Excuse me. Thank you.

44:41.875 --> 44:44.245
- Who made the call?
- I... I did.

44:44.375 --> 44:46.575
I told her not to go with him.

44:47.292 --> 44:49.172
But she would.

44:49.292 --> 44:52.832
- Go with who?
- One of that... bike gang.

44:53.708 --> 44:56.118
The living dead, they call themselves.

45:00.083 --> 45:01.423
That lot.

45:10.167 --> 45:12.287
Did the fuzz come to your house
last night, too?

45:12.417 --> 45:15.747
Yeah.
Right, who the hell did it, then, eh?

45:15.875 --> 45:17.575
Hatchet, where was you last night?

45:17.667 --> 45:19.457
Why does everybody think it's me?

45:19.583 --> 45:22.123
The police said one of us killed them
and it wasn't me.

45:22.250 --> 45:25.460
Yeah. Well, who did it, then. Eh?

45:26.458 --> 45:28.578
I was playing at a gig last night.

45:28.667 --> 45:31.417
- I was shacked up at a motel.
- Hinky?

45:31.542 --> 45:33.582
Drop me out,
i was watching telly all night.

45:33.708 --> 45:37.078
Did any of you ask the fuzz
what the killer looked like?

45:40.208 --> 45:41.918
Well, I did.

45:43.250 --> 45:45.170
They described tom.

45:46.042 --> 45:48.332
Right down to his name tag.

45:59.500 --> 46:01.290
Someone's dug him up!

46:02.250 --> 46:04.330
Someone's dug him up and took his bike!

46:04.458 --> 46:06.288
And pinched his clothes.

46:06.417 --> 46:08.707
Yeah. And then did the killings.

46:08.833 --> 46:10.713
Making it look like one of us!

46:10.833 --> 46:13.583
Well, when we get him... l'll kill him!

46:37.875 --> 46:39.125
Don't you know me, Abby?

46:42.000 --> 46:44.250
Morning, hinky. Gash.

46:45.250 --> 46:47.630
Chopped meat. Jane.

46:48.458 --> 46:51.038
Bertram. Hatchet.

46:52.167 --> 46:55.037
Look, tom latham's dead.

46:55.167 --> 46:58.707
I'm the leader of this gang now.
Who are you?

46:58.833 --> 47:02.173
I'm tom. I've come back.

47:02.292 --> 47:05.422
Like I told you, Abby, it can be done.

47:05.542 --> 47:07.462
And here I am to prove it.

47:07.583 --> 47:09.583
Any of you could do it if you wanted to.

47:09.667 --> 47:13.457
There's only one condition. You have to
believe you're gonna come back.

47:13.583 --> 47:16.543
Believe enough
so that you really want to die.

47:16.625 --> 47:18.665
That's all there is to it.

47:18.792 --> 47:22.632
Maybe. But that doesn't prove
you're tom latham, does it?

47:30.792 --> 47:33.422
- Tom!
- And another thing.

47:35.167 --> 47:37.167
You can only die once.

47:37.292 --> 47:41.132
After that,
nothing and nobody can harm you.

47:41.250 --> 47:43.920
Oh, man, what are we waiting for?

48:30.375 --> 48:33.785
The lord is my Shepherd,
i shall not want.

48:34.458 --> 48:37.288
He maketh me
to lie down in green pastures.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.420
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

48:41.292 --> 48:43.172
He restoreth my soul.

48:43.292 --> 48:47.212
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for his namesake.

48:48.083 --> 48:52.293
Yea, though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.

48:52.417 --> 48:54.327
For thou art with me,

48:54.458 --> 48:56.748
thy rod and thy staff comfort me.

48:56.875 --> 49:01.245
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

49:01.375 --> 49:04.955
Thou annoitest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.

49:05.917 --> 49:10.287
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life

49:10.417 --> 49:13.577
and I will dwell
in the house of the lord forever.

49:22.083 --> 49:26.293
My wife would like a last look
at our daughter.

49:26.417 --> 49:29.167
Oh, yes, of course. If you please.

50:05.833 --> 50:07.963
Whoo-hoo!

50:08.083 --> 50:10.713
- Ok?
- Yeah, great!

50:22.083 --> 50:25.003
Good afternoon, ladies!

51:03.625 --> 51:05.575
Hey, look!

51:05.667 --> 51:08.287
It's father Christmas!

51:08.417 --> 51:09.877
Why don't you get out of it?

51:10.000 --> 51:12.170
Nur-nur-nur-nur!

51:13.417 --> 51:15.247
You stupid kids!

51:17.958 --> 51:19.288
Stupid kids!

51:23.333 --> 51:25.043
Teach him a lesson?

51:43.750 --> 51:45.000
Get out of it!

52:13.125 --> 52:14.745
Hello, Abby.

52:15.667 --> 52:17.917
Tom! Ohh!

52:19.333 --> 52:21.003
Oh, I missed you.

52:26.042 --> 52:28.082
Jane and hinky, what happened to them?

52:32.375 --> 52:33.785
Hinky isn't coming back.

52:33.917 --> 52:36.497
At the last moment, he hesitated.

52:37.542 --> 52:39.082
He didn't really wanna die.

52:43.167 --> 52:45.997
Poor hinky. And Jane?

52:47.542 --> 52:49.462
She's out there.

52:58.792 --> 53:00.042
Tom, she's dead!

53:01.125 --> 53:03.625
Of course!
Some of my best friends are dead.

53:11.875 --> 53:14.125
Hey, look! No arms!

53:17.542 --> 53:20.002
Well, you two must be having fun.

53:20.125 --> 53:21.875
Come with us, Abby.

53:22.833 --> 53:24.543
Supposing...

53:24.625 --> 53:27.495
Supposing at the last moment
i was frightened, like hinky.

53:28.417 --> 53:30.167
I need you, Abby.

53:30.292 --> 53:32.172
If I had you, I'd have everything.

53:33.333 --> 53:35.003
If only I could believe that.

53:50.583 --> 53:54.333
From the look of those skid marks,
something must've forced him over.

53:54.458 --> 53:56.328
Did you get anything
out of the witnesses?

53:56.458 --> 53:59.578
Yes, sir.
Exactly the same story from all of them.

53:59.667 --> 54:02.827
Two motorcyclists
jabbing at his tyre with a knife.

54:03.708 --> 54:05.578
Any identification?

54:06.292 --> 54:08.212
Yeah. The living dead again.

54:10.125 --> 54:13.375
All right, they've had it this time.
This is a murder charge.

54:13.500 --> 54:15.380
- Pull them all in!
- Right, sir.

54:29.458 --> 54:32.168
Hm. Message from the station, inspector.

54:32.292 --> 54:35.292
- Yes, sergeant?
- They've brought in all the gang.

54:35.417 --> 54:37.577
- Right.
- Roger.

54:43.792 --> 54:45.332
That's bloody odd.

54:54.250 --> 54:55.920
Get after them!

55:25.458 --> 55:27.538
- X-u-n...
- X-u-n...

55:27.625 --> 55:30.915
- 9-9-3.
- ..9-9-3.

55:33.917 --> 55:36.957
- Y-g-j...
- Y-g-j...

55:37.875 --> 55:40.455
5-7-g. No! Er, 6-7-g.

55:40.583 --> 55:42.043
6-7-g.

56:30.750 --> 56:32.750
It's the latham house.

56:32.875 --> 56:34.325
Drive in.

56:56.208 --> 56:58.788
Y- g-j...

56:58.917 --> 57:01.707
6-7-g.

57:03.208 --> 57:06.668
Check those registrations, please.
And give them priority.

57:07.583 --> 57:10.043
But my son is dead, inspector.

57:10.167 --> 57:11.917
Yes, I know.

57:12.042 --> 57:16.082
But this is the only place
those motorbikes could've gone.

57:17.208 --> 57:21.288
Shadwell,
have any of tom's friends been here?

57:21.417 --> 57:22.827
No, madam.

57:23.792 --> 57:26.082
- Is it important?
- Very.

57:26.208 --> 57:27.668
It's murder.

57:29.375 --> 57:30.995
What can I do to help you?

57:31.125 --> 57:34.375
The thing is, mrs latham, an outbreak
like this doesn't just happen.

57:34.500 --> 57:36.830
There's always something behind it.

57:36.958 --> 57:40.168
Now, ever since your son died...

57:42.417 --> 57:44.707
- I'm sorry.
- Please go on.

57:45.667 --> 57:47.537
First your son was killed.

57:48.625 --> 57:52.285
The following night,
someone wearing your son's clothes...

57:53.083 --> 57:55.253
Murdered five people.

57:57.792 --> 58:01.542
Three days later,
two more of your son's gang died,

58:01.625 --> 58:03.375
a boy and a girl.

58:04.250 --> 58:06.710
This afternoon,
there was another killing.

58:06.833 --> 58:10.963
Immediately after the girl's body
disappeared from her coffin.

58:11.083 --> 58:12.213
He must have...

58:12.333 --> 58:15.543
Inspector, mrs latham has been under
a great strain.

58:16.875 --> 58:20.205
The girl means something to you,
doesn't she, mrs latham?

58:21.042 --> 58:22.922
You must warn her family.

58:23.042 --> 58:25.042
They must have nothing to do with her.

58:25.167 --> 58:27.207
Madam, you must rest.

58:27.875 --> 58:29.955
Please tell them, inspector. Please.

58:30.083 --> 58:33.673
If that girl comes back,
they must have nothing to do with her!

58:33.792 --> 58:35.792
It's evil!

58:35.917 --> 58:38.747
Please tell them, inspector! Please!

58:38.875 --> 58:41.035
Yes, yes, of course I will.

58:42.167 --> 58:43.787
Now, don't worry.

58:59.458 --> 59:01.998
I suppose everyone
has their breaking point.

59:07.417 --> 59:10.127
I'm sorry. I should've realised
what a shock it's been.

59:10.250 --> 59:12.080
Yes, it has.

59:12.208 --> 59:13.668
Thank you.

59:21.125 --> 59:24.625
We've, er... checked on the owners
of those bikes, sir.

59:25.750 --> 59:27.000
Well?

59:27.125 --> 59:30.575
Well, they belong to tom latham
and Jane pettibone,

59:30.708 --> 59:33.618
the young woman
whose body disappeared this afternoon.

59:44.083 --> 59:47.293
Pigs! Pigs! We're gonna kill ya!

59:50.667 --> 59:53.247
Do you hear?
We're gonna out you to bits!

59:54.125 --> 59:56.325
Oh, belt up, hatchet.

59:56.458 --> 59:58.418
We're in enough trouble as it is.

59:59.208 --> 01:00:01.788
But we ain't done nothing!
We're innocent!

01:00:01.917 --> 01:00:05.457
It's a murder charge.
20 years, you know? Pick up two.

01:00:05.583 --> 01:00:07.753
You're a fine lot.

01:00:09.583 --> 01:00:12.253
Do you really think tom
would let us take the rap?

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:14.665
Oh, what can he do? We're in jail.

01:00:14.792 --> 01:00:16.832
- So?
- So what can he do?

01:00:17.625 --> 01:00:21.075
When you come back,
you can do anything, remember?

01:00:42.667 --> 01:00:46.207
Who the hell's making all that noise?

01:00:49.458 --> 01:00:51.828
What the hell do you think you're up to?

01:00:51.958 --> 01:00:54.618
We've come to give ourselves up.
We've been naughty.

01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:56.830
Yes, well, you're up to your neck
in trouble now.

01:00:56.958 --> 01:00:58.918
- Should I close the door?
- Yes, please, love.

01:00:59.042 --> 01:01:01.582
Now, I'm booking you both
for a breach of the peace.

01:01:01.708 --> 01:01:05.208
Oh, that's terrible!
Which way to the cells?

01:01:06.792 --> 01:01:07.922
Names.

01:01:08.042 --> 01:01:10.002
- Yes.
- Please.

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:12.665
- Tom latham.
- And Jane pettibone.

01:01:12.792 --> 01:01:14.332
Addresses.

01:01:15.542 --> 01:01:18.582
Er, oh, care of the cemetery
will find us.

01:01:18.667 --> 01:01:20.827
Being funny isn't gonna help you, miss.

01:01:21.917 --> 01:01:23.667
What the blazes?

01:01:23.792 --> 01:01:25.672
- What's going on in here?
- They just rode in.

01:01:25.792 --> 01:01:28.672
I wanna have a talk with you two.
Where did you get these machines?

01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:37.380
- Tom.
- Well? Have you made up your mind yet?

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:38.880
Yes.

01:01:45.417 --> 01:01:47.207
I'm coming with you.

01:03:15.083 --> 01:03:17.123
- Oh. Oh!
- Sorry.

01:03:20.625 --> 01:03:22.035
Thank you.

01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:27.583
- Is that your bike?
- Yeah. Yeah. Do you like it?

01:03:27.708 --> 01:03:30.828
- Bet it's fast.
- Would you like to...

01:03:37.708 --> 01:03:40.118
Sorry. Gotta go.

01:04:04.667 --> 01:04:06.577
Hey, constable!

01:04:06.708 --> 01:04:08.288
That's my bike!

01:04:08.417 --> 01:04:11.457
Is it now? Then come on down here!

01:04:11.583 --> 01:04:13.173
Ok.

01:05:22.458 --> 01:05:24.328
Out you go.

01:05:25.875 --> 01:05:27.785
Go!

01:05:34.542 --> 01:05:36.502
Go!

01:05:49.833 --> 01:05:52.373
Hey, want this?

01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:52.250
What?

01:10:01.625 --> 01:10:02.995
Oh!

01:10:06.208 --> 01:10:08.618
Oh!

01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:14.580
Thank you.

01:10:22.458 --> 01:10:24.578
Shadwell! Shadwell!

01:10:24.667 --> 01:10:26.577
Oh, tom!

01:10:26.667 --> 01:10:29.417
Tom! Tom. Where is he?

01:10:32.083 --> 01:10:33.923
Frog!

01:10:34.042 --> 01:10:36.712
Frog.

01:10:45.708 --> 01:10:47.618
Who are you?

01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:49.630
I'm a police inspector.

01:10:54.875 --> 01:10:56.705
Then I'm alive.

01:10:56.833 --> 01:10:59.293
Yes. You were lucky.

01:11:00.792 --> 01:11:05.212
Why? Why should a young, pretty girl
want to die?

01:11:06.292 --> 01:11:09.132
Why should any of them
want to kill themselves?

01:11:09.250 --> 01:11:11.580
The others. Are they...

01:11:12.917 --> 01:11:15.247
Yes. All of them.

01:11:45.125 --> 01:11:47.245
You mind which one we start with?

01:11:47.375 --> 01:11:50.575
No. It's all the same to me.
Three, is it?

01:11:50.708 --> 01:11:52.578
No, sir, there's been another one.

01:11:52.667 --> 01:11:54.127
Four?

01:11:55.625 --> 01:11:59.205
Bloody work horse, that's what I am.
Come on, let's get started.

01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:08.790
Come on, out you come.

01:12:09.708 --> 01:12:11.118
All right?

01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:18.040
All right, lift.

01:12:24.833 --> 01:12:28.003
No marks of violence.
Probable cause of death, drowning.

01:12:37.292 --> 01:12:39.582
Let's see if he's got
any water in his lungs.

01:12:39.667 --> 01:12:41.997
Yes, sir.

01:12:42.125 --> 01:12:45.035
- Who the hell could that be?
- Why don't you go and find out?

01:12:55.083 --> 01:12:57.793
Well, there's not much doubt about that.

01:12:57.917 --> 01:13:00.747
It's for you, doctor.
Your wife. She says it's urgent.

01:13:00.875 --> 01:13:03.535
Oh, blast!

01:13:03.625 --> 01:13:06.915
Er, pour that into a beaker
and stick a label on it, will you?

01:13:07.042 --> 01:13:08.792
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

01:13:37.708 --> 01:13:39.828
Are you deaf or something?

01:13:43.333 --> 01:13:46.003
I'm sorry, my love,
there's nothing I can do about it.

01:13:46.125 --> 01:13:48.035
You'll just have to start without me.

01:13:48.167 --> 01:13:49.917
Ok. Bye-bye.

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:25.118
- Hello?
- 'Abby holman, please.'

01:14:26.583 --> 01:14:29.873
- who's calling, please?
- 'Her friend.'

01:14:31.833 --> 01:14:34.793
I'm afraid miss holman died last night.

01:14:36.083 --> 01:14:39.333
- She's dead, shadwell!
- You must be very happy.

01:14:39.458 --> 01:14:43.208
Happy? She's made it, mother!
She's dead.

01:14:43.333 --> 01:14:45.423
Oh, my god, that poor girl.

01:14:45.542 --> 01:14:49.502
Cheer up!
This is the happiest day of my life!

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:54.250
What's the matter?

01:14:56.250 --> 01:14:57.580
Mother?

01:14:57.708 --> 01:14:59.788
What are you going to do now?

01:15:01.125 --> 01:15:03.125
What are you all going to do next?

01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:05.920
Oh, there's lots to be done.

01:15:08.208 --> 01:15:11.038
For starters, do you know
how many policemen there are?

01:15:11.167 --> 01:15:13.707
And judges? Teachers?

01:15:13.833 --> 01:15:16.583
Preachers? Do-gooders?

01:15:16.667 --> 01:15:19.707
You mean the entire establishment?

01:15:19.833 --> 01:15:23.713
Right. And if I run out of ideas,
hatchet has a programme.

01:15:23.833 --> 01:15:26.173
Oh, yes, there's lots to be done.

01:15:30.208 --> 01:15:34.458
The reason I told them you were dead
is that I want to set a trap.

01:15:35.917 --> 01:15:37.877
With your help.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.040
I'm so glad I didn't die.

01:15:41.917 --> 01:15:43.877
It was very close.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.290
Now, listen to me, Abby.
Whoever dug up tom latham's body

01:15:47.417 --> 01:15:49.537
and took Jane pettibone from her coffin

01:15:49.625 --> 01:15:53.205
also stole those four bodies
from the morgue.

01:15:53.333 --> 01:15:56.253
Now, they were all members
from the same gang. Your gang.

01:15:56.375 --> 01:15:58.535
You are the last of them.

01:15:58.625 --> 01:16:02.075
If whoever they may be
thinks that you are dead,

01:16:02.208 --> 01:16:05.168
I'm certain they'll come
for your body, too.

01:16:05.292 --> 01:16:07.252
That's when we'll get them.

01:16:07.375 --> 01:16:09.455
But I'm not dead.

01:16:09.583 --> 01:16:11.583
I've announced that you are.

01:16:11.667 --> 01:16:16.167
I want to take your body to the morgue
and see what'll happen.

01:16:16.458 --> 01:16:18.708
Now, will you do it?

01:16:27.292 --> 01:16:31.132
Nothing will happen to you. I promise
we'll take every possible precaution.

01:16:33.542 --> 01:16:35.922
- Inspector?
- Uh-huh?

01:16:36.042 --> 01:16:38.542
If you loved somebody

01:16:38.625 --> 01:16:40.705
but didn't want to see them any more,

01:16:40.833 --> 01:16:42.543
what would you do?

01:16:42.625 --> 01:16:45.285
Would you meet them and tell them?

01:16:45.417 --> 01:16:47.247
Or would you just go away?

01:16:47.375 --> 01:16:49.035
Well, er...

01:16:50.042 --> 01:16:53.002
It would be more honest
to tell them to their face.

01:16:53.125 --> 01:16:54.535
Yes.

01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:15.540
Tom! Tom!

01:18:16.583 --> 01:18:19.423
I've got to talk to you! Now!

01:18:19.542 --> 01:18:21.542
Why? What's the hurry?

01:18:21.625 --> 01:18:23.705
It can't wait!

01:18:23.833 --> 01:18:25.673
Haven't you caught on yet?

01:18:25.792 --> 01:18:29.382
We've got all the time there is!
All eternity!

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.460
Look out, Jean!

01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:54.130
Come on!

01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:18.830
It's easy to kill live people.

01:19:25.458 --> 01:19:27.828
Watch this!

01:19:31.250 --> 01:19:33.170
Oh! My baby!

01:19:33.292 --> 01:19:35.042
Oh! My baby!

01:19:41.833 --> 01:19:44.123
Well, what do we do now?

01:19:46.125 --> 01:19:48.415
I've always fancied
driving through a brick wall.

01:19:48.542 --> 01:19:51.212
- How about you?
- Why not?

01:20:02.625 --> 01:20:06.075
- Where are we going?
- My place.

01:20:07.958 --> 01:20:10.578
I'll take the right wall,
you take the left.

01:20:23.083 --> 01:20:24.873
What happened?

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.250
- My back wheel skidded.
- Liar!

01:20:27.375 --> 01:20:29.375
You're not dead.

01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:35.080
That's what I was trying to tell you,
tom.

01:20:35.208 --> 01:20:37.078
I don't want to die.

01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:10.040
I must stop him.

01:21:11.583 --> 01:21:14.753
- You can't.
- I must.

01:21:15.917 --> 01:21:18.327
You made a bargain. It was for all time.

01:21:24.542 --> 01:21:27.252
I'm going to break that bargain.

01:22:02.667 --> 01:22:05.037
I still want you, Abby.

01:22:05.167 --> 01:22:07.667
I can't kill myself.

01:22:07.792 --> 01:22:09.582
I won't let you go.

01:22:11.667 --> 01:22:14.457
If we kill you, you can never come back.

01:22:15.542 --> 01:22:18.382
But if you do it, we'll be together...

01:22:19.708 --> 01:22:21.248
forever.

01:22:22.333 --> 01:22:24.253
I want to go on living.

01:22:24.375 --> 01:22:26.245
No.

01:22:35.333 --> 01:22:37.503
You've got three minutes to decide.

01:23:03.458 --> 01:23:06.788
- Are you quite sure now?
- Yes.

01:23:06.917 --> 01:23:09.577
And you know
what you will become?

01:23:09.667 --> 01:23:12.627
- Yes.
- And that it will be for all eternity?

01:23:14.708 --> 01:23:16.788
Yes.

01:23:16.917 --> 01:23:20.827
And that your son was part of
our bargain and he will have to pay, too?

01:23:22.625 --> 01:23:24.495
It was his own doing.

01:24:57.458 --> 01:24:59.248
Time's up.
