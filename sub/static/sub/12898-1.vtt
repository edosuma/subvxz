01:03.630 --> 01:08.260
Where can I go from Your Spirit?

01:08.334 --> 01:12.862
Where can I flee
from Your presence?

01:12.939 --> 01:15.407
If I go up to the heavens,

01:15.475 --> 01:17.409
You're there.

01:17.477 --> 01:21.573
If I rise on the wings of the dawn,

01:21.648 --> 01:26.483
if I settle on the far side of the sea,

01:26.553 --> 01:28.783
even there,

01:28.855 --> 01:32.689
Your Hand will guide me.

01:32.759 --> 01:36.126
There is no place you can go,

01:36.196 --> 01:39.131
no place you can be,

01:39.199 --> 01:41.030
where you are not in the presence

01:41.101 --> 01:43.797
of the Lord our God.

01:43.870 --> 01:46.430
There is no thought
you can have,

01:46.506 --> 01:49.007
no dream
you can dream,

01:49.075 --> 01:53.771
where the Lord our God
does not see.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.838
If I go up to the heavens,

01:55.915 --> 01:58.748
You are there.

01:58.818 --> 02:02.879
If I rise on the wings of the dawn,

02:02.956 --> 02:07.689
if I settle
on the far side of the sea,

02:07.760 --> 02:09.818
even there,

02:09.895 --> 02:13.627
Your hand will guide me.

02:13.700 --> 02:18.160
If I make my bed in the depths,

02:18.238 --> 02:22.231
You are there.

03:02.682 --> 03:05.173
Dorothy? We're back.

03:12.759 --> 03:14.488
Dorothy?

03:19.265 --> 03:23.395
Naughty baby won't drink its milk!

03:23.469 --> 03:25.528
Jesus!

04:01.841 --> 04:06.403
Shh. Shh.

04:06.479 --> 04:10.472
- No, please!
- Calm down.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.183
You see what I mean?

04:15.255 --> 04:16.882
Absolutely normal.

04:35.008 --> 04:37.533
Can I have a cigarette?

04:46.853 --> 04:50.220
Things are still very...

04:50.290 --> 04:51.848
confused.

04:51.924 --> 04:53.414
There's no rush.

04:53.493 --> 04:55.791
You take all the time you want.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.934
Where should I begin?

05:07.006 --> 05:08.906
You wanted this case.

05:08.975 --> 05:13.241
You knew how difficult it would be.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.310
But you still wanted it.

05:20.553 --> 05:22.953
You insisted.

05:26.459 --> 05:29.587
I wanted to go.

05:29.662 --> 05:32.130
I needed to.

05:34.834 --> 05:38.065
I had to get away
before the city smothered me.

08:27.373 --> 08:29.637
They're riding our backside!

08:29.709 --> 08:31.006
Hurry up!

08:39.452 --> 08:41.317
Hurry up!

08:41.386 --> 08:44.049
Faster!

08:44.123 --> 08:47.149
Go! Step on it! Step on it!

09:18.925 --> 09:20.392
Come on, lads.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.837
The Lord giveth,

09:36.909 --> 09:39.036
and the Lord taketh away.

09:39.111 --> 09:40.373
Look over there!

09:55.695 --> 09:58.095
You all right, miss? You're okay?

10:00.032 --> 10:01.556
I wasn't speeding.

10:01.634 --> 10:03.226
There were two cars racing each other.

10:03.302 --> 10:04.394
Racing each other?

10:04.470 --> 10:06.665
An orange and a blue one.

10:08.674 --> 10:11.006
It's hardly a diving watch you've got there.

10:11.077 --> 10:12.567
Let it dry.

10:12.645 --> 10:14.943
It'll tick again in a day or two.

10:15.014 --> 10:17.312
Well, we can't
sit around here all night.

10:30.396 --> 10:33.593
Wait. There's a back entrance.

10:47.747 --> 10:49.681
The psychiatrist.

10:52.585 --> 10:54.815
- Gloria.
- Did you have a bit of an accident, huh?

10:58.491 --> 11:00.288
All right, Colin?

11:01.894 --> 11:03.361
You come with me.

11:03.429 --> 11:05.488
We'll get you dried off.

11:19.879 --> 11:23.110
Here it is. Isn't a suite,
but I hope you'll be comfortable.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.616
I'll maybe get you another blanket.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.711
It's been cold these last few nights.

11:31.957 --> 11:33.754
The heating's been on all day,

11:33.826 --> 11:36.090
so there should be
plenty of hot water.

11:40.299 --> 11:42.164
This is the bathroom.

11:42.234 --> 11:43.701
Should I run a bath for you?

11:54.580 --> 11:57.014
I'll bring you up another towel.

12:09.295 --> 12:12.025
Don't take any notice of the menfolk.

12:12.098 --> 12:14.623
They're decent enough men at heart.

12:20.206 --> 12:21.867
Be back up in a few minutes.

12:21.941 --> 12:23.841
Bring you up a bit of supper.

13:00.012 --> 13:02.242
There you are.

13:02.314 --> 13:03.747
Did you sleep well?

13:03.816 --> 13:06.148
Not with an electric guitar
playing over my head all night.

13:07.820 --> 13:09.014
That's funny.

13:09.088 --> 13:12.057
There's no one here but ourselves.

13:12.124 --> 13:14.354
You were maybe dreaming.

13:14.426 --> 13:18.226
It's a lovely day.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.128
I'll get you some white pudding.

13:20.199 --> 13:22.463
It's delicious. You'll love it.

14:00.472 --> 14:02.201
How long will it take to fix this?

14:02.274 --> 14:03.263
It's scrap.

14:03.342 --> 14:04.809
Even if we could get the parts,

14:04.877 --> 14:07.107
it would cost more
than the car's worth.

14:11.383 --> 14:12.475
Can I rent a car?

14:12.551 --> 14:15.145
I've only got that pickup over there.

14:15.221 --> 14:19.351
- Is it safe?
- How safe was your BMW?

14:19.425 --> 14:21.416
I'll get you the keys.

14:58.697 --> 14:59.721
You must understand that I'm here

14:59.798 --> 15:02.892
as much as for your sake
as for Dorothy's.

15:02.968 --> 15:04.902
You're already making excuses for her?

15:04.970 --> 15:06.767
I'm trying to find out the truth.

15:06.839 --> 15:09.137
The truth?

15:09.208 --> 15:11.199
The truth is...

15:11.277 --> 15:14.269
you'll find some name for her condition,

15:14.346 --> 15:15.745
and in another couple of years,

15:15.814 --> 15:18.214
she'll be out there abusing
someone else's child,

15:18.284 --> 15:21.344
maybe even her own.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.752
Can you tell me
what happened that night?

15:26.558 --> 15:29.220
That was the first time
we used Dorothy as a babysitter.

15:29.295 --> 15:32.924
I had my doubts,
but the pastor said she was all right.

15:32.998 --> 15:35.228
Dorothy? We're back.

15:37.403 --> 15:39.496
Dorothy?

15:43.642 --> 15:46.736
Naughty baby won't drink its milk!

15:49.181 --> 15:51.115
Jesus!

15:52.318 --> 15:53.683
He's my baby.

15:53.752 --> 15:55.515
He's my baby. He's my baby!

15:55.587 --> 15:57.350
- Get away from him!
- He's my baby!

15:58.924 --> 16:00.289
Hello, shit face!

16:00.359 --> 16:02.088
What have you done?

16:02.161 --> 16:05.289
What have you done?
What have you done!

16:06.498 --> 16:10.093
Come on. Come on!

16:14.974 --> 16:18.000
Pastor, you gotta
let us on to the mainland.

16:18.077 --> 16:19.567
It's an emergency. Please!

16:19.645 --> 16:21.408
In this case, we'll make an exception.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.277
Well, I'll call for assistance.
They'll send a helicopter.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.694
She's a fuckin' nutcase.

16:38.764 --> 16:42.256
Ask Paul Fallon's son Jake
what he thinks of her.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.416
Hello, Dorothy.

17:36.555 --> 17:37.579
I'm Dr. Morton,

17:37.656 --> 17:39.749
but you can call me Jane.

17:44.396 --> 17:47.194
You were expecting me, weren't you?

18:05.684 --> 18:08.118
You're very gifted.

18:15.727 --> 18:19.163
Dorothy, we need to talk.

18:22.334 --> 18:23.323
Can I sit here?

18:33.879 --> 18:35.574
You know why I'm here, don't you?

18:38.417 --> 18:39.941
Look, all I want is to listen to you.

18:40.018 --> 18:43.112
I'm not here to judge you,
and I won't make any decisions.

19:00.539 --> 19:01.597
Do you like babies?

19:03.942 --> 19:06.968
What baby?

19:07.045 --> 19:09.605
There was no baby.
I wasn't even there.

19:13.352 --> 19:15.650
I don't want to speak anymore.

19:17.489 --> 19:19.889
Nobody listens to me.

19:21.560 --> 19:22.618
Nobody.

19:22.694 --> 19:24.594
I'm listening.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.801
And I'll understand you.

19:30.869 --> 19:32.928
Dorothy.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.939
Trust me.

19:42.114 --> 19:45.515
So where were you if you
weren't at the Kearsleys'?

19:48.287 --> 19:50.721
I said my prayers,

19:50.789 --> 19:52.848
and I went to bed.

19:55.827 --> 19:58.227
And I woke up in the morning

19:58.297 --> 20:00.663
in my bed.

20:04.836 --> 20:07.828
Do you remember anything else?

20:07.906 --> 20:10.204
I'm sick of all your questions.

20:12.644 --> 20:14.373
Okay.

20:16.982 --> 20:20.577
Well, why don't we just
swap places, then?

20:20.652 --> 20:22.552
You ask me questions.

20:24.656 --> 20:26.385
I can ask you questions?

20:36.468 --> 20:38.902
You think she's guilty, don't you?

20:38.971 --> 20:41.838
I'm just doing the first psychological
assessment in this case.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.169
Case?

20:43.242 --> 20:45.301
This case is a child.

20:45.377 --> 20:46.742
And she has suffered enough.

20:46.812 --> 20:48.404
It's up to the court
to decide what happens.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.506
I promise I'll do what's best for her.

21:05.030 --> 21:07.021
"Curiosity.

21:07.099 --> 21:10.796
Sin or flaw?"

21:14.439 --> 21:16.703
That's enough now!

21:16.775 --> 21:19.369
Write that out 100 times

21:19.444 --> 21:20.706
and show me in the morning.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.178
Now go!

21:40.766 --> 21:42.063
So you're the doctor, too?

21:42.134 --> 21:43.931
I am.

21:44.002 --> 21:46.470
How long have you
been looking after Dorothy?

21:46.538 --> 21:49.632
Not since she was 13.

22:07.793 --> 22:09.260
Healthy child, isn't she?

22:10.896 --> 22:15.026
Here on the island,
we live a clean, healthy life.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.898
Our faith shelters us.

22:17.969 --> 22:21.029
I suppose you just failed to notice
her mental illness?

22:21.106 --> 22:24.542
Dorothy is a special child.

22:24.609 --> 22:26.975
There is a place for her
in our community.

22:27.045 --> 22:28.945
Even if she did molest that baby?

22:29.014 --> 22:31.141
It is the Lord's place to judge, not mine.

22:31.216 --> 22:32.649
I'm not here to judge her, either.

22:32.718 --> 22:34.379
I'm here to help her.

22:34.453 --> 22:35.613
And she can be helped.

22:38.457 --> 22:41.824
We have little faith in your science.

22:41.893 --> 22:45.488
How can your science
fathom her pure soul?

22:45.564 --> 22:48.499
One of God's angels.

22:48.567 --> 22:52.162
An angel that might end up in prison.

23:06.718 --> 23:09.881
They're not really fond
of women in here, are they?

23:09.955 --> 23:12.981
It's a very devout community.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.958
They take their faith very seriously.

23:15.026 --> 23:16.220
You're not a believer?

23:16.294 --> 23:17.659
Me? No. Jeez.

23:17.729 --> 23:19.094
Had enough of that when I was a kid.

23:19.164 --> 23:20.256
You were born here?

23:20.332 --> 23:22.129
Hmm. And raised.

23:22.200 --> 23:26.637
Tried to escape the place,
but this island is like a magnet.

23:26.705 --> 23:28.070
You can't escape.

23:31.176 --> 23:32.268
There you are.

23:40.452 --> 23:42.579
What is it with white food and this island?

23:42.654 --> 23:44.417
Hey, you've only three days of it.

23:44.489 --> 23:45.581
I have to live here.

23:50.362 --> 23:52.296
I saw Dorothy today.

23:52.364 --> 23:54.662
Yeah? How'd it go?

23:54.733 --> 23:55.893
I think she's scared to death.

23:55.967 --> 23:58.299
- Scared of who?
- Don't know.

24:00.539 --> 24:02.530
Herself, maybe.

24:02.607 --> 24:05.132
Self-loathing can be a powerful driver.

24:05.210 --> 24:07.075
Don't stare at her too long there, John.

24:07.145 --> 24:08.476
You know what these shrinks are like.

24:08.547 --> 24:11.380
Wouldn't want her to know
we're thinking about fucking her.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.008
Jesus.

24:58.630 --> 25:00.689
Dear Lord...

25:04.870 --> 25:10.308
...once again we ask You
to shower Your blessings upon us.

25:11.977 --> 25:15.174
Give unto Your servant Dorothy

25:15.247 --> 25:18.808
the warmth of Your divine light.

25:18.884 --> 25:21.182
Let her find the way

25:21.253 --> 25:23.744
through the halls of darkness.

25:27.158 --> 25:29.888
Talk to me.

25:29.961 --> 25:33.055
I know you're there, my son.

25:35.467 --> 25:38.868
Say hello to your mother, son.

25:48.179 --> 25:50.511
Happy Birthday, son.

25:57.422 --> 26:00.653
Perhaps this is not the time.

26:00.725 --> 26:02.556
I'm sorry, mate.

26:21.346 --> 26:22.904
Hello!

26:22.981 --> 26:25.609
Janey!

26:25.684 --> 26:28.175
What's up, lying shrink?

26:28.253 --> 26:30.517
Hope we're not wakin' you up, eh!

26:44.736 --> 26:46.169
We don't need you!

26:46.237 --> 26:48.569
Go back to where you belong!

27:02.554 --> 27:03.816
Would you calm down, John?

27:03.888 --> 27:05.822
Come on, lad. They're only kids.

27:05.890 --> 27:07.619
- Christ Almighty!
- Jesus.

27:07.692 --> 27:09.125
They're just kids, John.

27:09.194 --> 27:10.957
- It's just kids messing about.
- Let go of me.

27:11.029 --> 27:12.792
I'll fucking kill them.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.016
They were underneath
my window, waiting for me.

27:34.085 --> 27:36.815
Look, I can see you're upset.

27:36.888 --> 27:39.379
But I know everybody on this island.

27:39.457 --> 27:42.654
There aren't any teenagers
that fit that description.

27:42.727 --> 27:45.252
Or orange cars, for that matter.

27:47.032 --> 27:48.329
You think I'm imagining this?

27:48.400 --> 27:50.334
No, but...

27:52.237 --> 27:54.535
Look,

27:54.606 --> 27:55.868
if it helps, I'll stick around

27:55.940 --> 27:58.465
for the next couple of days, okay?

27:58.543 --> 28:01.910
You're leaving Sunday, right?

28:12.857 --> 28:14.290
That's my son.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.327
Lives with his mother on the mainland.

28:18.063 --> 28:19.587
Do you have any kids?

28:23.735 --> 28:24.929
A little boy.

28:25.003 --> 28:26.664
Yeah?

28:28.473 --> 28:29.565
He died.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.141
I'm sorry.

28:37.215 --> 28:38.648
It's okay.

28:40.652 --> 28:43.746
Um, I'd better go.

28:43.822 --> 28:45.756
Thanks for the drink.

29:17.722 --> 29:19.087
When my sister died,

29:19.157 --> 29:21.057
there was no one else to look after her.

29:21.126 --> 29:23.720
So it was natural she stay with me.

29:23.795 --> 29:25.319
What about Dorothy's father?

29:25.396 --> 29:28.797
We never knew him.

29:28.867 --> 29:32.928
Mabel wasn't promiscuous,
you understand?

29:33.004 --> 29:34.972
She was fanciful,

29:35.039 --> 29:36.028
flighty.

29:48.453 --> 29:52.890
She wasn't simple, either,
no matter what the others say.

29:52.957 --> 29:55.755
She just couldn't seem
to hold down a job

29:55.827 --> 29:57.624
until she took the job
in the funeral parlor,

29:57.695 --> 30:00.357
laying out the dead.

30:00.431 --> 30:02.456
She liked that.

30:02.534 --> 30:05.002
But she was a good mother.

30:05.069 --> 30:07.333
And she kept Dorothy safe
from the other children.

30:07.405 --> 30:10.374
Do you have any idea why she was
bullied by the other children?

30:10.441 --> 30:13.274
Because they hated
anyone or anything

30:13.344 --> 30:14.834
that was different.

30:14.913 --> 30:17.848
God help the child.
She was always different.

30:17.916 --> 30:20.544
Did you ever think
she might be dangerous?

30:20.618 --> 30:23.815
She never laid a hand on that baby.

30:23.888 --> 30:25.287
She swore to me she didn't,

30:25.356 --> 30:26.983
and I believe her.

30:30.695 --> 30:32.754
Why do you want to help me?

30:32.831 --> 30:34.492
Because I've heard
you talk and...

30:34.566 --> 30:36.864
I don't think you're here to help me.

30:36.935 --> 30:39.631
I am here to help you.

30:39.704 --> 30:41.069
I think I can help you, Dorothy.

30:41.139 --> 30:42.834
You know why?

30:42.907 --> 30:44.636
Because it's my gift.

30:46.110 --> 30:47.600
You're good at painting,

30:47.679 --> 30:50.239
and I'm good at listening
and understanding.

31:16.341 --> 31:19.833
I can see why you like this place.

31:19.911 --> 31:21.970
It's beautiful.

31:23.548 --> 31:28.576
My mother used to bring me here
when I was little.

31:28.653 --> 31:32.214
We had this game
where we pretended to fly.

31:34.626 --> 31:37.094
I always wanted to fly.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.695
Suppose you could fly.
Where would you go?

31:41.766 --> 31:44.599
Nowhere.

31:44.669 --> 31:46.762
I'd just fly.

31:58.716 --> 32:00.479
I'd never land.

32:00.551 --> 32:02.416
I'd fly as far as I could

32:02.487 --> 32:04.717
until my last breath...

32:07.859 --> 32:09.224
and then fall.

32:10.695 --> 32:12.959
And everything would be over.

32:28.413 --> 32:29.345
Don't be shy, boy.

32:29.414 --> 32:31.177
Hey.

32:34.118 --> 32:36.916
Hey, Paul,
that son of yours won't take a drink.

32:36.988 --> 32:38.888
Go on, Jakey.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.754
The Pastor's not here.

32:52.503 --> 32:54.471
You're a man now, Jakey.

33:13.057 --> 33:14.388
Uhh...

34:49.487 --> 34:51.614
The love of the Lord Jesus

34:51.688 --> 34:55.022
is as the ocean, vast and endless.

34:55.092 --> 34:57.357
We see it lap upon our shore.

34:57.428 --> 35:01.091
But know that it
laps on every shore.

35:01.165 --> 35:04.498
The Lord sees all and knows all...

35:04.569 --> 35:06.696
the righteous and the sinner,

35:06.771 --> 35:09.604
the guilty and the blameless.

35:12.343 --> 35:14.072
Morning.

35:16.747 --> 35:18.476
We had an appointment.
Do you remember?

35:18.549 --> 35:19.607
I'm sorry.

35:19.684 --> 35:20.810
I had to take Dorothy

35:20.885 --> 35:23.046
to the police station to sign the register.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.645
She's ready for you now.

35:28.025 --> 35:30.323
Hi, Dorothy.

35:30.394 --> 35:33.261
Do you want to come for a walk with me?

35:36.534 --> 35:38.092
I'll take you back to your aunt afterwards.

35:41.739 --> 35:44.207
I want to stay with my auntie.

35:44.275 --> 35:45.299
Come on, child.

35:46.711 --> 35:48.941
Come out.

35:49.013 --> 35:52.107
Do as you're told, child.

35:53.718 --> 35:55.879
That's a girl.

36:15.740 --> 36:17.640
Your aunt is really nice
with you, isn't she?

36:17.708 --> 36:20.142
Yes, she is.

36:20.211 --> 36:23.647
She's looking after me
until Mommy comes back.

36:23.714 --> 36:26.410
Where is your mommy?

36:26.484 --> 36:29.009
She's out on the sea, sailing.

36:29.086 --> 36:32.180
She'll soon be back
to pick up her little Mimi

36:32.256 --> 36:35.657
and give her a pretty dress.

36:35.726 --> 36:37.489
M-Mimi?

36:37.562 --> 36:39.325
How old are you?

36:41.999 --> 36:43.330
3.

36:43.401 --> 36:45.335
Ain't she gorgeous?

36:52.610 --> 36:55.238
So if you are Mimi,

36:55.313 --> 36:57.281
where has Dorothy gone?

36:57.348 --> 36:59.179
She hasn't gone.

36:59.250 --> 37:00.444
She's asleep.

37:00.518 --> 37:01.542
Asleep?

37:01.619 --> 37:03.018
Yes.

37:03.087 --> 37:05.715
In here. Right inside.

37:07.391 --> 37:09.552
Dorothy is asleep inside of you?

37:10.962 --> 37:12.224
You know what?

37:12.296 --> 37:13.991
When her mother died,

37:14.065 --> 37:15.532
I had to go to the funeral

37:15.600 --> 37:18.125
because Dorothy was sleeping.

37:18.202 --> 37:20.102
They don't let her out much.

37:20.171 --> 37:21.229
Who doesn't let her out?

37:21.305 --> 37:23.671
The others.

37:23.741 --> 37:24.765
Who are they?

37:24.842 --> 37:26.104
I'm not allowed to tell.

37:26.177 --> 37:28.771
Why don't they let her out?

37:28.846 --> 37:32.942
Because she always
tries to kill herself.

37:33.017 --> 37:35.212
Do you think my hair is pretty?

38:13.991 --> 38:15.720
Do you like it?

38:15.793 --> 38:17.420
It's a gift. You can keep it on.

38:17.495 --> 38:19.429
Oh, thank you!

39:01.706 --> 39:04.470
Tear that bitch's dress!

39:04.542 --> 39:06.669
Tear that bitch's dress!

39:14.752 --> 39:15.810
Dorothy!

39:15.886 --> 39:18.946
Trash it to ribbons!

39:19.023 --> 39:21.787
- Mimi!
- Shut your mouth, you little bitch!

39:21.859 --> 39:24.521
Aah! Bitch!

39:24.595 --> 39:26.529
Who are you?

39:26.597 --> 39:28.531
Talk to me.

39:28.599 --> 39:30.692
Fuck off! Ugh!

39:30.768 --> 39:31.996
Fuck off, slag!

39:32.069 --> 39:34.003
I'll kick your fuckin'...

39:48.052 --> 39:50.987
Mommy.

39:51.055 --> 39:52.989
Mommy.

39:53.057 --> 39:56.185
Mommy.

39:59.430 --> 40:03.025
Mommy, where are you?

40:03.100 --> 40:07.059
Mommy, help me.

40:07.138 --> 40:08.332
Help me.

40:08.406 --> 40:11.068
Shh.

40:11.142 --> 40:12.871
Shh. It's over.

40:12.943 --> 40:14.570
I'm here with you, baby.

40:18.616 --> 40:20.243
How dare you!

40:20.317 --> 40:22.148
You should be ashamed of yourself.

40:22.219 --> 40:23.277
Come on, pet.

40:24.288 --> 40:27.621
I would appreciate it
if you didn't interfere during the sessions.

40:27.691 --> 40:29.352
Come on, darlin'.

40:29.427 --> 40:30.689
Go on now.

40:30.761 --> 40:32.126
Good girl.

41:23.214 --> 41:25.182
Hello? Tom?

41:25.249 --> 41:27.183
It's me, Jane.

41:27.251 --> 41:29.845
Yeah. Great.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.888
Well, it's a very interesting case.

41:31.956 --> 41:34.584
I think I just might have to stay...

41:34.658 --> 41:36.148
Hello?

41:37.328 --> 41:38.590
Hello?

41:41.532 --> 41:42.829
Shit.

41:46.303 --> 41:49.170
Badger!

41:49.240 --> 41:51.174
Oh. You scared me.

41:51.242 --> 41:52.641
Sorry.

41:52.710 --> 41:54.473
It's difficult to call
the mainland from the island.

41:56.814 --> 41:58.145
You going back to the village?

41:58.215 --> 42:00.740
I am now, I suppose.

42:10.895 --> 42:13.159
Your fags are crap.

42:13.230 --> 42:14.857
Haven't you got anything stronger?

42:29.914 --> 42:32.678
- Dorothy?
- Uh-uh.

42:32.750 --> 42:35.218
Wrong answer.

42:35.286 --> 42:37.117
Want to try again?

42:37.187 --> 42:38.984
Well, I see Dorothy.

42:39.056 --> 42:41.786
But you're listening to Mary.

42:41.859 --> 42:44.419
Fuckin' weird, huh?

42:44.495 --> 42:46.292
So where's Mimi?

42:50.534 --> 42:54.265
Little bitch couldn't keep her mouth shut.

42:54.338 --> 42:57.205
And what about Dorothy?

42:57.274 --> 43:00.607
Moaning or praying somewhere in here.

43:03.247 --> 43:06.182
She's only good for one thing...

43:06.250 --> 43:09.742
taking the hangover after I get drunk.

43:09.820 --> 43:11.720
Is that what happened, Mary?

43:11.789 --> 43:14.349
You hurt the baby and let Dorothy face
the consequences?

43:14.425 --> 43:16.791
I didn't lay a finger on that brat!

43:16.860 --> 43:19.454
But if she goes to jail for it,
there's no more drinking for you.

43:19.530 --> 43:21.395
You better take care, shrink!

43:21.465 --> 43:23.490
You're a stranger here.

43:23.567 --> 43:25.057
Stick your nose in too far,

43:25.135 --> 43:27.262
and you might lose it.

43:27.338 --> 43:28.703
Trust me.

43:28.772 --> 43:30.239
You don't want that.

43:40.884 --> 43:43.375
Who said you could feel me tits?

43:45.389 --> 43:48.881
Why are we going to
this shitty party anyway?

43:48.959 --> 43:52.417
Because I want to dance.

43:52.496 --> 43:54.487
Fuck you.

43:54.565 --> 43:57.193
And you know how well I can dance.

43:57.267 --> 43:58.598
Hey.

44:00.871 --> 44:03.271
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

44:49.620 --> 44:51.554
Jesus.

45:06.236 --> 45:07.726
The bastards.

45:07.805 --> 45:10.000
The bastards!

45:12.076 --> 45:15.273
Christ. I'm gonna make them pay for this.

45:15.345 --> 45:17.313
By Christ I am.

45:48.612 --> 45:50.477
Come on, lads. Come on.

45:56.820 --> 45:57.980
Come on.

46:01.658 --> 46:03.558
Mrs. Fallon.

46:06.063 --> 46:08.395
Mrs. Fallon, I'm Jane Morton.

46:08.465 --> 46:10.330
- I'm here to...
- I know who you are.

46:11.502 --> 46:13.197
I need to speak to your son Jake.

46:13.270 --> 46:16.671
You want to ask him
about that bitch Dorothy Mills?

46:16.740 --> 46:20.039
She's a liar. A slut and a liar.

46:22.012 --> 46:24.640
Why do you call her a slut?

46:33.624 --> 46:35.216
What's the problem?

46:35.292 --> 46:36.782
What do you want?

46:36.860 --> 46:38.259
Come to gloat?

46:38.328 --> 46:40.455
- Paul, calm down.
- Shut up!

46:40.531 --> 46:43.523
You're getting a real kick
out of this, aren't you?

46:43.600 --> 46:44.862
Messin' us around like guinea pigs.

46:44.935 --> 46:46.368
Well, let me tell you something.

46:46.436 --> 46:48.631
This island is no
fucking laboratory, Doctor.

46:48.705 --> 46:50.366
Come on, now, Paul. Drop it.

46:55.312 --> 46:57.280
- All right, come on.
- You fucking bird.

46:57.347 --> 46:58.871
Go on.

47:00.083 --> 47:02.984
What the fuck is wrong with you people?

47:03.053 --> 47:04.543
Just go.

47:25.676 --> 47:28.110
Get a grip on yourself, boy.

47:28.178 --> 47:30.840
We didn't do anything wrong.

47:30.914 --> 47:32.245
Not us.

47:35.552 --> 47:38.544
We've nothing to be guilty about.

47:38.622 --> 47:39.680
No, sir.

48:09.553 --> 48:11.487
Does nothing work on this bloody island?

48:11.555 --> 48:13.648
- We'll see what we can do tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

48:13.724 --> 48:16.420
It's the Lord's day today.

48:27.604 --> 48:31.438
Go and see in the church.

48:31.508 --> 48:35.103
She let the devil into her house.

48:35.178 --> 48:36.611
Our Father...

48:36.680 --> 48:39.080
- Our King of glory...
- Our King of glories...

48:39.149 --> 48:42.607
- We ask the Lord Jesus...
- We ask the Lord Jesus...

48:42.686 --> 48:44.677
To bear your servant Dorothy...

48:44.755 --> 48:46.620
To bear your servant Dorothy...

48:46.690 --> 48:48.954
Once more into the realm of the dead.

48:49.026 --> 48:51.256
Once more into the realm of the dead.

48:57.968 --> 49:00.664
Praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ,

49:00.737 --> 49:03.035
- our Father, our King...
- I beg you.

49:03.106 --> 49:05.131
Please let him talk to me.

49:05.208 --> 49:08.041
Please let him find the peace to talk.

49:08.111 --> 49:09.100
Leave her alone!

49:09.179 --> 49:11.841
Through the blackness of eternity...

49:11.915 --> 49:15.009
Fuck all of you pigs!

49:17.654 --> 49:19.588
Please stop!

49:21.325 --> 49:22.758
It hurts!

49:29.333 --> 49:34.066
Let her go
before I fucking kill you!

49:34.137 --> 49:36.367
Please don't!

49:36.440 --> 49:38.374
Leave her alone!

49:38.442 --> 49:40.569
For God's sake.

49:40.644 --> 49:44.603
Please don't. Please.

49:44.681 --> 49:46.615
I shall notify the court in the morning

49:46.683 --> 49:49.880
that Dorothy must be taken
into custody immediately.

49:49.953 --> 49:50.977
She's not safe with you.

49:51.054 --> 49:53.352
I'm taking her with me.

50:10.207 --> 50:11.265
Aah!

50:11.341 --> 50:13.741
You bitch! Bitch!

50:13.810 --> 50:15.038
All right, Dorothy, calm down.

50:15.112 --> 50:17.842
Oh, hey, it's the fucking sheriff!

50:22.085 --> 50:24.019
I asked you not to intervene.

50:24.087 --> 50:26.180
Well, next time, I'll tie her up.

50:35.165 --> 50:37.156
My head.

50:37.234 --> 50:40.965
Well, you were kind of asking for it.

50:41.038 --> 50:44.303
Dorothy?

50:44.374 --> 50:47.605
I'm not Dorothy.

50:47.677 --> 50:48.803
I'm Kurt.

50:50.247 --> 50:52.238
Well, nice to meet you, Kurt.

50:52.315 --> 50:53.407
I'm Jane.

50:55.786 --> 50:58.311
Tell me what I can do to help you.

50:58.388 --> 51:00.356
I always take the pain for her.

51:00.424 --> 51:02.016
For Dorothy.

51:02.092 --> 51:06.028
I take the pain so she doesn't get hurt.

51:06.096 --> 51:07.529
She wouldn't handle it.

51:07.597 --> 51:09.326
That's very brave of you.

51:09.399 --> 51:11.390
Yeah, well, I'm getting
a bit bored with it now.

51:11.468 --> 51:12.992
And I don't want to go to jail.

51:13.070 --> 51:15.197
If Dorothy goes to jail,
we'll all go, won't we?

51:15.272 --> 51:18.002
Yes.

51:18.075 --> 51:20.407
But you have to help me.

51:20.477 --> 51:23.037
Were you there at the Kearsleys'?

51:23.113 --> 51:24.910
- Did you see the baby?
- No, no.

51:24.981 --> 51:28.439
I can't talk. Duncan won't let me.

51:28.518 --> 51:30.679
- Who's Duncan?
- Duncan's the boss.

51:30.754 --> 51:32.085
Where is he? Can I talk to him?

51:32.155 --> 51:34.680
Trust me, you don't want
anything to do with him.

51:34.758 --> 51:36.350
You, especially. He'd kill you.

51:36.426 --> 51:37.950
Tell Duncan that I want to speak to...

51:40.297 --> 51:42.663
Come back here, bastard!

51:42.732 --> 51:44.666
Bastard! Shut it!

51:44.734 --> 51:46.998
Hold her down for me.

51:49.573 --> 51:51.006
Dorothy.

51:52.275 --> 51:54.436
No.

51:55.946 --> 51:58.540
I killed the baby, didn't I?

51:58.615 --> 52:00.344
Tell me. Tell me, please.

52:00.417 --> 52:02.351
- Dorothy?
- What are you doing? No.

52:02.419 --> 52:03.545
- I promise...
- Stop it.

52:03.620 --> 52:06.589
- I promise it won't hurt.
- Stop it!

52:06.656 --> 52:08.647
We should take her home.

52:13.330 --> 52:15.321
I gave her a tranquilizer.

52:15.398 --> 52:17.559
She'll sleep until tomorrow morning.

52:23.140 --> 52:25.608
I'll be here before she wakes up.

52:47.030 --> 52:48.793
You were very impressive back there.

52:48.865 --> 52:50.332
Thanks.

52:50.400 --> 52:52.960
But you should've got
that ferry this morning.

52:53.036 --> 52:55.129
You know, people
are getting nervous around here.

52:55.205 --> 52:56.172
You're unsettling them.

52:56.239 --> 52:57.797
I'm unsettling them?

52:57.874 --> 52:59.739
You've had time to gather
your material, you know?

52:59.809 --> 53:02.869
You can write
your report now, can't you?

53:02.946 --> 53:05.744
Well, maybe there's more
at stake than just a report.

53:05.815 --> 53:07.180
Look, I've a small boat.

53:07.250 --> 53:09.844
I could easily take you to the mainland.

53:09.920 --> 53:12.115
I can't leave without Dorothy.

53:12.189 --> 53:14.248
Well, the next ferry isn't for three days.

53:14.324 --> 53:17.953
Well, then, I'll just have to wait for it.

53:18.028 --> 53:20.326
See you later.

53:55.065 --> 53:57.659
Jakey.

53:57.734 --> 53:59.497
Hey, gorgeous.

54:02.038 --> 54:04.006
Want to party?

54:04.074 --> 54:05.666
Dorothy, you shouldn't be out here...

54:05.742 --> 54:06.731
Shut up.

54:08.211 --> 54:10.975
You drive.

54:26.496 --> 54:27.986
Come on.

54:30.667 --> 54:32.567
Come on.

54:39.042 --> 54:40.805
Come on.

54:40.877 --> 54:43.607
Come on. Come on.

54:50.053 --> 54:52.988
You really think
I was gonna let a pinhead like you

54:53.056 --> 54:54.614
jerk off inside me?

54:54.691 --> 54:57.819
You're a funny boy, Jakey, aren't you?

54:57.894 --> 54:59.384
Can't resist.

54:59.462 --> 55:03.660
I'm desperate,
but I'm not that desperate.

55:10.407 --> 55:13.865
You twisted slut. I'll fucking kill you!

55:13.943 --> 55:15.638
You slag!

55:15.712 --> 55:18.613
You fucking dirt box!

56:52.208 --> 56:53.800
Hello?

56:53.877 --> 56:55.139
<i>Dr. Norton?</i>

56:55.211 --> 56:57.645
Yes, it's me. Who's speaking?

56:57.714 --> 56:59.648
<i>Dorothy tried to kill herself.</i>

56:59.716 --> 57:01.047
Who is this?

57:01.117 --> 57:03.984
<i>Dorothy needs you. Come quickly.</i>

57:20.670 --> 57:22.103
Dorothy!

57:22.172 --> 57:23.264
Why, you must be freezing.

57:23.339 --> 57:25.933
I'm not Dorothy. I'm Kurt.

57:26.009 --> 57:28.204
What happened, Kurt?

57:28.278 --> 57:30.075
When you put Dorothy to bed,

57:30.146 --> 57:34.014
Mary took over
and escaped out the window.

57:34.083 --> 57:36.108
What did she do?

57:36.186 --> 57:38.313
The usual tricks.

57:38.388 --> 57:40.117
She got arsed with some bloke,

57:40.190 --> 57:43.648
and then vanished
when things got out of hand.

57:43.726 --> 57:48.060
Dorothy was so close
to throwing herself off that cliff.

57:48.131 --> 57:50.258
If I hadn't been there to save her...

57:50.333 --> 57:51.960
Good man, Kurt.

57:52.035 --> 57:54.094
Dorothy will be very proud of you.

57:56.005 --> 57:58.974
Oh, sweetheart, I'm here.
It's all right now.

57:59.042 --> 58:01.840
I'm taking you home.

58:01.911 --> 58:03.902
What sort of drug did you give her?

58:55.865 --> 58:58.197
I'm not dead?

58:59.302 --> 59:00.234
I'm not dead!

59:00.303 --> 59:02.066
No, no, you're not dead.

59:02.138 --> 59:05.130
But I saw the cliff.

59:05.208 --> 59:06.573
I remember the cliff.

59:06.643 --> 59:08.668
I fell off the cliff. I saw the waves.

59:08.745 --> 59:10.337
Shh. You're safe now. It's okay.

59:10.413 --> 59:12.540
No, but I'm a freak.

59:12.615 --> 59:14.276
Nobody can help a freak!

59:14.350 --> 59:15.681
You're not a freak, Dorothy, okay?

59:15.752 --> 59:18.243
I've done horrible things
I don't even remember.

59:18.321 --> 59:21.586
I'm so ashamed.

59:21.658 --> 59:23.888
I'm so ashamed.

59:23.960 --> 59:26.952
Listen, Dorothy. Listen carefully to me.

59:27.030 --> 59:32.525
The things that are happening inside of you
are not your fault.

59:32.602 --> 59:33.967
These blackouts that you have,

59:34.037 --> 59:36.369
they're caused
by different characters

59:36.439 --> 59:40.671
that you've created in your mind.

59:40.743 --> 59:42.768
And when you're scared,
just like now,

59:42.845 --> 59:46.246
your... your mind sends out
a character to protect you.

59:46.316 --> 59:49.012
But I don't remember anything.

59:50.286 --> 59:52.686
No, but it's because...

59:52.755 --> 59:54.382
it's because you...

59:54.457 --> 59:56.288
- Dorothy.
- No.

59:56.359 --> 59:59.157
It's because...

59:59.228 --> 01:00:02.163
you disappear when that happens.

01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:05.099
Dorothy...

01:00:06.502 --> 01:00:07.594
they're inside of you.

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:10.969
No. No.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.668
Dorothy, they're trying to keep you

01:00:13.743 --> 01:00:15.540
- from killing yourself.
- It isn't true.

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:18.080
Dorothy, it was one of these characters

01:00:18.147 --> 01:00:20.547
that hurt this baby, Dorothy, not you.

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:22.482
You mustn't be afraid of them.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.645
Listen, you must try
to relate to them.

01:00:28.057 --> 01:00:30.617
Get your hand off me.

01:00:30.693 --> 01:00:33.685
Didn't I already tell you to piss off?

01:00:33.763 --> 01:00:36.323
Duncan, is that you?

01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:37.832
Did you hurt the baby?

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:39.390
Do you think I hurt the baby?

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:42.905
- Why did you do it?
- How can I do anything?

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:44.405
I'm just a character.

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:45.998
Why did you do it?

01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:47.474
Payback.

01:00:47.543 --> 01:00:49.170
Just a little bit of payback.

01:00:49.245 --> 01:00:52.009
What could a baby
have done against you?

01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:55.346
You think you're
so fucking smart, don't you?

01:00:55.418 --> 01:00:58.854
You don't know anything.

01:01:01.224 --> 01:01:04.785
Why don't you take a look
at Dorothy's latest drawing?

01:01:04.861 --> 01:01:07.955
She did it just for you!

01:01:16.706 --> 01:01:19.231
Isn't that sweet little David,

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:22.175
floating and dead

01:01:22.245 --> 01:01:26.011
like a rotten old fish?

01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:35.480
Mommy, Mommy, the water is so cold.

01:01:35.558 --> 01:01:38.755
- Stop it.
- I don't want to die.

01:01:38.828 --> 01:01:41.490
Stop it. Stop it!

01:01:41.564 --> 01:01:46.467
Don't shout at me, Mommy.
I'm drowning. Help me.

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:50.336
Help me. Why did you leave me?

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:52.306
Don't let me drown.

01:01:55.912 --> 01:01:59.177
Mommy, help me.

01:01:59.248 --> 01:02:01.682
Why did you leave me?

01:02:01.751 --> 01:02:03.582
Don't let me drown.

01:02:03.653 --> 01:02:06.554
Please, the water is so cold.

01:02:06.622 --> 01:02:09.750
The water is so cold.

01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:13.353
I don't want to die.

01:03:59.402 --> 01:04:00.926
Please forgive me.

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:07.165
It was my fault.

01:04:09.245 --> 01:04:11.577
I thought it was safe.

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:15.782
Please forgive me.

01:06:13.402 --> 01:06:16.371
Who is the boy in this photograph?

01:06:16.439 --> 01:06:18.566
That's my grandson.

01:06:20.176 --> 01:06:22.041
He's the boy that drove me into the lake,

01:06:22.111 --> 01:06:23.408
him and two other kids.

01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:26.676
Oh, no. It couldn't be him.

01:06:26.749 --> 01:06:29.741
He's dead this ten years.

01:06:31.687 --> 01:06:33.621
He was good on the guitar.

01:06:39.462 --> 01:06:41.362
What was his name?

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:45.190
Duncan.

01:06:55.711 --> 01:06:56.871
How did he die?

01:06:56.946 --> 01:06:59.312
Such a stupid thing.

01:06:59.382 --> 01:07:04.342
They crashed their car into the lake.

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:05.614
They?

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:09.146
Duncan and his two young friends,

01:07:09.225 --> 01:07:11.193
Mary and Kurt.

01:07:13.496 --> 01:07:16.932
No, that's impossible.

01:07:16.999 --> 01:07:18.728
I saw them in the car in front of me.

01:07:18.801 --> 01:07:20.996
I've seen them in the square.

01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:23.561
If you don't believe me,
check the records.

01:08:39.849 --> 01:08:41.908
You must have told her
about your son.

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:45.147
You're the only one
I've mentioned it to.

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:47.416
And I didn't even
tell you how he died.

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:49.685
You've obviously been going
through too much strain.

01:08:49.758 --> 01:08:51.350
Look, you're exhausted,
and your imagination's

01:08:51.426 --> 01:08:52.689
beginning to play tricks on you.

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:54.456
Tricks?

01:08:54.529 --> 01:08:56.622
You don't have the slightest idea.

01:08:56.698 --> 01:08:59.064
These characters
inside of her head are dead.

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:00.863
They're dead!

01:09:00.935 --> 01:09:05.066
And these kids that drove me
into the lake, they're dead, too.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:06.904
And they're the ones
that are turning poor Dorothy

01:09:06.975 --> 01:09:09.069
into a fucking ventriloquist!

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:10.737
One time she's Mimi,
then she's Kurt,

01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:12.404
then she's Duncan, then she's Mary.

01:09:12.481 --> 01:09:14.176
I've heard them
all speak through her,

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:16.013
and there's not a fucking thing
she can do about it.

01:09:16.085 --> 01:09:17.176
How can you believe that?

01:09:17.252 --> 01:09:19.118
You're the psychiatrist, for fuck's sake.

01:09:19.188 --> 01:09:22.122
Colin, some evil shit is going on.

01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:25.752
I swear, she feels people's pain.

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:29.491
I mean, I even heard
my own dead son speak.

01:09:29.564 --> 01:09:31.192
Jane. Jane, Jane, Jane.

01:09:34.703 --> 01:09:35.897
Shh.

01:09:37.606 --> 01:09:40.073
Hush.

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:50.776
Jane, you have
to get away from here.

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:52.444
I'm gonna take you
to the mainland tomorrow...

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:55.547
- No.
- No, listen.

01:09:55.624 --> 01:09:58.525
I don't like the way people are acting.

01:09:59.528 --> 01:10:03.259
I don't think you're safe here.

01:10:03.332 --> 01:10:06.233
What is their real problem
with Dorothy?

01:10:09.271 --> 01:10:10.568
What are they so fucking scared of?

01:10:10.639 --> 01:10:14.632
It's old stuff, okay? Local stuff.

01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:18.441
It's like you've lifted a stone
and exposed something.

01:10:20.449 --> 01:10:22.747
I can't believe it's Dorothy.

01:10:33.429 --> 01:10:34.453
Here.

01:10:36.599 --> 01:10:38.499
These'll help you
get through the night.

01:10:40.102 --> 01:10:41.729
You can sleep here.

01:10:41.804 --> 01:10:43.465
I'll wake you
first thing in the morning.

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:45.439
Trust me.

01:10:45.507 --> 01:10:47.600
We'll make decisions in the morning.

01:10:47.676 --> 01:10:48.938
Okay.

01:11:43.065 --> 01:11:44.862
No!

01:11:44.933 --> 01:11:46.264
Badger!

01:11:46.335 --> 01:11:48.530
Colin, you fucking loser!

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:52.602
Get them, Colin!

01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:25.197
Oh.

01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:09.577
I'm going to take Dorothy
back with me to the hospital.

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:12.238
With the right treatment there,

01:14:12.314 --> 01:14:14.214
I'm confident we can help her.

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:24.949
It's for her own good, Mrs. McMahon.

01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:27.359
If I can prove this is a case
of multiple personality,

01:14:27.429 --> 01:14:29.021
there's a good chance she'll be acquitted.

01:14:29.097 --> 01:14:32.396
You want to keep her gift
all to yourself, don't you?

01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:37.562
I couldn't bear to lose
my Mary all over again.

01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:39.971
We're talking about
Dorothy, Mrs. McMahon.

01:14:40.042 --> 01:14:43.773
Well, my little Mary died 10 years ago.

01:14:43.846 --> 01:14:47.247
I thought I'd never see her again.

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:51.980
But the good Lord brought Dorothy
into my home as a gift.

01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:54.614
She's worked miracles for me.

01:15:06.435 --> 01:15:11.168
She's made your son
speak, hasn't she?

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.172
David.

01:15:12.241 --> 01:15:14.436
That's his name, isn't it?

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:18.237
Isn't it?

01:15:19.781 --> 01:15:22.045
We have to think about Dorothy.

01:15:22.117 --> 01:15:23.914
We have to help her.

01:15:28.056 --> 01:15:29.421
I'll take good care of her.

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:00.821
You've gotta get away from here.

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:03.517
I've seen death
cast its wings on you.

01:16:14.603 --> 01:16:15.900
What is it, Dorothy?

01:16:19.141 --> 01:16:20.608
Is it the water?

01:16:23.045 --> 01:16:25.707
- And the blood?
- I'm scared.

01:16:27.983 --> 01:16:30.747
I don't want to remember.

01:16:30.819 --> 01:16:32.753
I'm scared.

01:16:36.892 --> 01:16:38.484
It's okay.

01:16:40.996 --> 01:16:43.931
You've gone through it once.

01:16:43.999 --> 01:16:45.796
And you can live it
again through memory.

01:16:48.337 --> 01:16:52.103
I want to take you
back in time, Dorothy.

01:16:52.174 --> 01:16:54.665
I'll count from 10 to 1.

01:16:57.479 --> 01:16:59.970
10,

01:17:00.048 --> 01:17:03.279
9,

01:17:03.352 --> 01:17:05.616
8,

01:17:05.687 --> 01:17:08.588
7,

01:17:08.657 --> 01:17:11.888
6,

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.222
5,

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:14.660
4,

01:17:14.730 --> 01:17:15.992
3,

01:17:16.064 --> 01:17:18.123
2,

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:19.258
1.

01:17:23.872 --> 01:17:25.965
Where are you?

01:17:27.843 --> 01:17:29.435
There was an accident.

01:17:31.046 --> 01:17:33.412
My mother is washing
the dead people.

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.615
- How old are you?
- I'm 5.

01:17:40.689 --> 01:17:42.748
- Do you know them?
- Yes.

01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:45.691
Look, Dorothy. Aren't they beautiful now?

01:17:47.929 --> 01:17:50.022
They've a long journey ahead of them,

01:17:50.098 --> 01:17:51.827
to the realm of the dead.

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:53.162
Shall we say good-bye to them?

01:17:54.236 --> 01:17:55.168
No...

01:17:55.237 --> 01:17:57.501
Don't be scared, Dorothy.

01:17:57.572 --> 01:18:00.166
Look. It's your cousin Mary.

01:18:00.242 --> 01:18:01.470
Give her a kiss good-bye.

01:18:01.543 --> 01:18:03.534
- No.
- Give her a kiss.

01:18:03.612 --> 01:18:07.139
No!

01:18:07.215 --> 01:18:09.206
Dorothy, give her a kiss good-bye.

01:18:14.423 --> 01:18:16.516
Come on.

01:18:31.773 --> 01:18:33.638
Shh. It's over now.

01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:35.973
It's over now. Dorothy. Shh.

01:18:36.044 --> 01:18:39.275
Shh.

01:18:39.347 --> 01:18:42.680
You didn't kiss the dead bodies.

01:18:42.751 --> 01:18:45.447
Your mind created Mimi
as a tiny little girl

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:48.284
who doesn't have
the slightest idea about death.

01:18:49.357 --> 01:18:51.655
She kissed the dead for you.

01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:54.321
Yeah.

01:18:54.396 --> 01:18:56.830
It's all over now.

01:18:56.898 --> 01:19:00.857
Shh. Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

01:19:00.936 --> 01:19:03.928
We'll leave tomorrow morning.

01:19:04.005 --> 01:19:05.836
Shh.

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:16.110
Evening, Colin.

01:20:16.178 --> 01:20:17.668
Remember me?

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:25.315
- No...
- You weren't so scared

01:20:25.387 --> 01:20:26.615
when you were with your three mates.

01:20:27.889 --> 01:20:28.878
No.

01:20:30.458 --> 01:20:31.652
You're not real.

01:20:31.726 --> 01:20:34.354
Don't pretend you've forgotten,
you fucking piece of shit!

01:20:34.429 --> 01:20:35.987
You're dead.

01:20:36.064 --> 01:20:37.292
Mary's dead. You're all dead.

01:20:37.365 --> 01:20:38.354
We're back.

01:20:38.433 --> 01:20:40.924
We've been waiting for you.

01:20:41.002 --> 01:20:43.163
Time for payback...

01:20:43.238 --> 01:20:45.672
Sheriff.

01:21:08.797 --> 01:21:10.424
You tell us who's next!

01:21:10.498 --> 01:21:11.465
It's up to you.

01:21:11.533 --> 01:21:12.932
There's a man lying dead in the hall.

01:21:13.001 --> 01:21:14.525
You tell us who's next.

01:21:42.864 --> 01:21:44.456
Don't you tell us what to do!

01:21:44.532 --> 01:21:46.090
Quiet, every one of you!

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:52.732
Dorothy, tell me what happened.

01:21:52.807 --> 01:21:55.207
I don't know. I don't know.

01:21:55.277 --> 01:21:57.404
When I woke up, he was dead.

01:21:57.479 --> 01:21:58.673
She's got to be stopped.

01:21:58.747 --> 01:22:00.738
Before she comes after all of us!

01:22:02.083 --> 01:22:04.677
Can't you see he killed himself?

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:06.380
Dorothy's not the problem.

01:22:06.454 --> 01:22:08.752
It's you! It's all of you!

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:10.757
She knows the truth
about your community.

01:22:10.825 --> 01:22:12.554
Dorothy is a lunatic,
just like her mother,

01:22:12.627 --> 01:22:13.651
and you know that.

01:22:13.728 --> 01:22:15.889
Dorothy's a member of our community.

01:22:15.964 --> 01:22:18.125
It's our responsibility to deal with her.

01:22:19.901 --> 01:22:22.563
My name is Duncan McLellan.

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.967
Oh, Duncan.

01:22:28.043 --> 01:22:29.510
My dear Duncan...

01:22:29.577 --> 01:22:32.068
I was a member
of your community, too.

01:22:41.690 --> 01:22:44.420
We're listening, Duncan.

01:22:44.492 --> 01:22:46.050
I'll show you.

01:23:27.402 --> 01:23:29.666
Tell us, Duncan.

01:23:29.738 --> 01:23:31.797
Why did you hurt
the Kearsleys' baby?

01:23:43.184 --> 01:23:45.744
His father had to pay.

01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:49.221
They all had to pay
for what they did to Mary!

01:23:51.459 --> 01:23:53.222
Yeah! Come on, Mary!

01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:18.851
Whoo!

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:22.287
Get the fuck away!

01:24:22.357 --> 01:24:24.348
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo!

01:24:24.426 --> 01:24:25.859
Whoo!

01:24:28.363 --> 01:24:29.762
Why don't you give us a dance?

01:24:29.831 --> 01:24:32.265
Just piss off, would you?

01:24:32.333 --> 01:24:33.698
Slapper!

01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:37.363
Duncan?

01:24:37.439 --> 01:24:38.872
Kurt!

01:24:40.542 --> 01:24:43.067
Why the fuck are
youse hiding from me?

01:24:43.144 --> 01:24:45.510
Keeping all the booze
to yourselves, is it?

01:24:47.882 --> 01:24:49.042
Lads!

01:24:52.854 --> 01:24:54.014
Fuck it.

01:24:57.592 --> 01:24:59.958
- Hey! Come back and dance.
- Fuck off!

01:25:00.028 --> 01:25:01.962
Better watch your language, you slut.

01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:03.224
Yeah, be polite to me friend.

01:25:03.298 --> 01:25:05.391
Hey! Let go of me, will you?

01:25:05.467 --> 01:25:07.264
Get the fuck off me!

01:25:07.335 --> 01:25:09.030
Get the fuck off me!

01:25:11.206 --> 01:25:14.039
Duncan! Duncan!

01:25:47.642 --> 01:25:48.631
Leave her alone!

01:25:49.878 --> 01:25:52.073
Jesus!

01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:54.809
Let her go! Or I swear I'll kill him!

01:25:54.883 --> 01:25:56.646
Let her go, lads! Let her go!

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:02.817
Back off! Back off!

01:26:02.891 --> 01:26:05.257
I'll cut his throat.

01:26:05.326 --> 01:26:07.055
Fucking shag this!

01:26:17.605 --> 01:26:19.095
I'll fucking kill him for that!

01:26:19.174 --> 01:26:20.539
This is getting out of hand, lad.

01:26:20.608 --> 01:26:22.542
He tried to kill you.
Are you with us or not?

01:26:34.889 --> 01:26:37.380
It's okay! It's over now!

01:26:37.458 --> 01:26:39.756
They're riding our backside!

01:26:39.827 --> 01:26:41.727
Hurry up!

01:26:44.599 --> 01:26:46.897
Faster! Speed it up, man!

01:26:48.603 --> 01:26:51.163
Try the fucking gas!

01:26:51.239 --> 01:26:53.400
Faster!

01:26:53.474 --> 01:26:54.771
I can't go faster!

01:26:54.842 --> 01:26:56.537
Hurry! Just step on it!

01:26:56.611 --> 01:26:58.238
Step on it!

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:01.345
Oh, God.

01:27:01.416 --> 01:27:03.475
Hurry up!
They're gonna kill us!

01:28:09.584 --> 01:28:10.573
You...

01:28:10.652 --> 01:28:13.519
You killed my daughter.

01:28:13.588 --> 01:28:15.988
You killed my daughter!

01:28:16.057 --> 01:28:18.184
Kurt. My Kurt.

01:28:18.259 --> 01:28:20.318
We were just young and stupid!

01:28:20.395 --> 01:28:21.657
We didn't mean...

01:28:22.997 --> 01:28:24.828
Forgive us, Duncan, please!

01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:27.700
Duncan!

01:28:36.644 --> 01:28:38.612
- You bastard.
- Get away from me.

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:39.977
Stay away!

01:28:40.048 --> 01:28:41.037
Stay away!

01:28:45.687 --> 01:28:47.951
Mary McMahon was up for it!

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:54.860
Oh...

01:28:54.929 --> 01:28:58.456
you bunch of hypocrites.

01:28:58.533 --> 01:29:00.967
You didn't bat an eye
when we took her away, did you?

01:29:01.035 --> 01:29:02.024
Hmm?

01:29:03.338 --> 01:29:04.805
You all thought she deserved it.

01:29:04.872 --> 01:29:07.033
Didn't you!

01:29:10.044 --> 01:29:11.875
We're all in this together.

01:29:11.946 --> 01:29:13.345
Together.

01:29:18.353 --> 01:29:20.446
We can keep this on the island.

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:23.948
- She's the only evidence.
- Dorothy!

01:29:24.025 --> 01:29:26.289
Please! Please, don't touch her!

01:29:26.361 --> 01:29:28.352
You leave her alone! Please!

01:29:28.429 --> 01:29:30.954
- Hush, woman!
- Don't touch her!

01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:32.727
Think about it now.

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:37.260
Huh? Do you really want
all the publicity?

01:29:37.338 --> 01:29:38.600
Hmm?

01:29:38.673 --> 01:29:40.937
Policemen?

01:29:41.008 --> 01:29:42.202
Journalists?

01:29:42.276 --> 01:29:43.766
Huh?

01:29:43.845 --> 01:29:47.576
All poking their noses
all around this island?

01:29:47.648 --> 01:29:49.513
Our island?

01:29:50.752 --> 01:29:56.315
It'll be the end
of your happy little community.

01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:05.296
Huh? Think about that now.

01:30:12.373 --> 01:30:15.103
She's the only evidence.

01:30:18.846 --> 01:30:19.870
You leave her alone!

01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:25.811
This is a time of tribulation.

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:29.441
Fear and anger

01:31:29.517 --> 01:31:33.078
threaten to drive apart
those who have lived in fellowship

01:31:33.154 --> 01:31:35.213
for many, many years.

01:31:36.924 --> 01:31:39.984
We cannot let this pass.

01:31:41.796 --> 01:31:45.562
For the sake
of the island, we must act.

01:31:45.633 --> 01:31:48.033
We must right this wrong.

01:31:52.874 --> 01:31:55.399
We will not hand you to the police.

01:31:57.078 --> 01:31:59.638
But you cannot stay here.

01:31:59.714 --> 01:32:02.842
You will be exiled
from this place forever,

01:32:02.917 --> 01:32:04.908
you and your families.

01:32:05.987 --> 01:32:08.717
Your homes will be leveled.

01:32:08.789 --> 01:32:11.587
All memory of you will be erased.

01:32:15.129 --> 01:32:18.223
If any man should disagree with this,

01:32:18.299 --> 01:32:20.130
let him speak now.

01:32:28.609 --> 01:32:30.907
We have all sinned.

01:32:30.978 --> 01:32:34.311
And we shall all suffer.

01:32:36.317 --> 01:32:38.182
So let us now devote ourself

01:32:38.252 --> 01:32:41.278
to the worship of the Lord our God,

01:32:41.355 --> 01:32:45.689
in the hope of redeeming
ourselves in His eyes.

01:32:48.896 --> 01:32:51.592
As for the psychiatrist,

01:32:51.666 --> 01:32:53.861
it was her own stubbornness

01:32:53.935 --> 01:32:56.995
and refusal to listen to reason

01:32:57.071 --> 01:33:00.472
which brought her to tragedy.

01:33:00.541 --> 01:33:03.408
Suffice to say

01:33:03.477 --> 01:33:08.107
she left us without word
of her destination.

01:33:56.530 --> 01:33:59.431
No.

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:02.594
No. It's not possible.

01:34:05.306 --> 01:34:06.238
I'm dead?

01:34:06.307 --> 01:34:07.467
I'm so sorry, Jane.

01:34:09.844 --> 01:34:12.176
It's all my fault.

01:34:12.246 --> 01:34:14.407
I should've stopped you
from going on that damned island.

01:34:14.482 --> 01:34:15.471
I feel so guilty.

01:34:15.549 --> 01:34:17.210
Don't say that.

01:34:18.352 --> 01:34:20.445
I'm happy you sent me.

01:34:22.523 --> 01:34:25.788
I couldn't save David, you see.

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:27.452
But at least I saved Dorothy.

01:34:29.363 --> 01:34:31.331
I saved her, didn't I?

01:34:32.867 --> 01:34:34.596
You saved her.

01:34:36.537 --> 01:34:37.799
You brought her back to me.

01:34:40.374 --> 01:34:41.398
She'll be acquitted,

01:34:41.475 --> 01:34:44.444
and she'll stay here
until she's cured.

01:34:47.715 --> 01:34:49.239
Yeah.

01:34:53.054 --> 01:34:54.817
And now it's up to you, Jane.

01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:59.619
You have to leave Dorothy's body.

01:34:59.694 --> 01:35:02.219
She won't be free until you're gone.

01:35:12.239 --> 01:35:14.764
Will you take good care of her?

01:35:14.842 --> 01:35:16.537
I promise.

01:35:29.523 --> 01:35:32.617
Keep it.

01:35:32.693 --> 01:35:34.684
David loved you so much.

01:35:38.032 --> 01:35:39.556
I'll keep it forever.

01:35:43.537 --> 01:35:47.268
Good-bye, my love.

01:36:18.739 --> 01:36:19.933
Dorothy?

01:36:22.343 --> 01:36:24.004
Is that you?

01:36:34.688 --> 01:36:37.452
Has Jane been crying?

01:36:37.525 --> 01:36:39.220
She was here.

01:36:42.363 --> 01:36:44.092
She's gone now.

01:36:47.868 --> 01:36:52.168
She's with her son... David.

01:36:54.542 --> 01:36:56.806
Do you think they're all gone?

01:36:59.046 --> 01:37:01.981
Duncan and Kurt

01:37:02.049 --> 01:37:03.812
and Mary?

01:37:03.884 --> 01:37:06.182
And Mimi, too?

01:37:06.253 --> 01:37:09.347
You have to learn to live
on your own now, Dorothy.

01:37:23.204 --> 01:37:24.637
You're free.
