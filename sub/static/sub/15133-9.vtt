00:01.167 --> 00:04.102
<i>Yes,
I'm laying odds on tomorrow</i>

00:04.170 --> 00:06.070
Call the Mormons.
Tell them you're
not coming back.

00:06.139 --> 00:07.606
<i>Previously on Smash...</i>

00:07.674 --> 00:09.642
<i>I can't put that
number in Bombshell.</i>

00:09.709 --> 00:11.643
<i>Fade up on a star</i>

00:11.711 --> 00:12.905
I'm going to get
you a new story.

00:12.979 --> 00:15.470
Leigh Conroy has agreed
to come out of retirement

00:15.548 --> 00:16.742
and play the part of Gladys.

00:16.816 --> 00:18.408
How am I
supposed to be anything

00:18.485 --> 00:20.919
when you're always here
sucking up the light?

00:21.554 --> 00:24.114
<i>If I were a boy</i>

00:24.190 --> 00:25.782
<i>Congratulations.</i>

00:25.859 --> 00:26.951
You just became our Diva.

00:27.660 --> 00:28.820
Here I am, 15 years too late,

00:28.895 --> 00:29.953
saying I'm sorry.

00:30.697 --> 00:31.925
You've got balls, Jimmy.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.461
We could get another drink.
I know a spot on the corner.

00:35.535 --> 00:36.968
What, did you run up here?

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:02.462 --> 01:04.054
Hey.
Hey.

01:04.697 --> 01:06.221
What time is it?

01:06.299 --> 01:08.267
I don't know. 7:00.

01:09.769 --> 01:11.760
What time did
we go to sleep?

01:11.838 --> 01:13.601
6:00.

01:14.074 --> 01:17.475
What? No!
We have rehearsal in an hour.

01:17.544 --> 01:19.011
So?

01:22.382 --> 01:23.781
Maybe Ana forgot her keys?

01:23.850 --> 01:25.579
She would call first.

01:25.985 --> 01:27.077
<i>- Hello?
- Karen?</i>

01:27.153 --> 01:29.178
<i>It's your father.</i>

01:29.255 --> 01:30.279
Dad?

01:30.356 --> 01:32.551
<i>It's cold.
Can you let me in?</i>

01:32.725 --> 01:34.556
Um, yeah, I'll buzz you up.

01:34.627 --> 01:36.720
Oh, my God. I forgot.
Ooh.

01:36.796 --> 01:37.922
I get to meet your dad, huh?

01:37.997 --> 01:39.464
Town, conference.
He's in town.
What?

01:39.532 --> 01:40.556
Look,
you got to get out of here.

01:40.633 --> 01:42.430
Really?
It's my dad.

01:42.569 --> 01:43.900
Oh, my gosh.
It's a mess in here.

01:44.537 --> 01:47.233
Um, my pants.

01:48.608 --> 01:50.098
Where do I even put this?

01:50.810 --> 01:52.801
Okay. Oh, gosh.

01:53.146 --> 01:55.114
Get the shoe,
get the shoe.
Here, shirt. Your shirt.

01:55.849 --> 01:56.907
Here, here, here. Hurry.

01:56.983 --> 01:59.781
Hey. It's all right.

01:59.853 --> 02:00.877
Bye.

02:00.987 --> 02:01.976
Mmm.

02:05.091 --> 02:07.082
Oh, my God,
go, go, go.
All right, I'm going.

02:12.165 --> 02:13.564
Dad. Hi.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.161
Can I come in?

02:15.235 --> 02:16.293
Oh, of course.

02:16.369 --> 02:18.360
It's just a mess.
I was going to clean up.

02:18.905 --> 02:20.839
Don't worry about it.

02:22.308 --> 02:23.866
You want some coffee?

02:24.878 --> 02:26.869
Uh, coffee...

02:28.314 --> 02:30.214
Ugh.

02:30.550 --> 02:31.881
Is that your mom again?

02:31.951 --> 02:34.078
Yeah, the fifth time
this morning.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.416
I wonder what's so important?

02:35.488 --> 02:37.080
Why don't you answer
and find out?

02:37.157 --> 02:40.149
<i>Because I'm still mad
at her for not coming to
the opening of Liaisons.</i>

02:40.260 --> 02:41.352
I didn't.

02:41.461 --> 02:43.190
You would have if
you weren't on tour.

02:43.263 --> 02:46.255
She was just sitting at home
updating her website

02:46.332 --> 02:47.822
and sending letters
to her fan club.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.835
She didn't even
send a card.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.768
"I'm sorry,
I'm too jealous
to attend"?

02:52.906 --> 02:55.636
But now that I'm
starring on Broadway,
the calls won't stop.

02:55.708 --> 02:58.268
I wish I was starring
on Broadway instead
of in the ensemble.

02:58.344 --> 02:59.538
Not even in the ensemble.

02:59.612 --> 03:01.307
A cover for the ensemble.

03:02.615 --> 03:05.345
Ivy, Tom and Eileen would like
to talk to you right away.

03:05.418 --> 03:06.783
In private.

03:11.891 --> 03:13.825
How does this sound?

03:13.893 --> 03:17.727
"Scott. It was so nice
to talk to you yesterday
and clear the air..."

03:17.830 --> 03:19.229
Are you writing an e-mail?

03:19.299 --> 03:21.961
I thought you were
doing a final pass
on today's scenes.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.059
I was.

03:23.136 --> 03:24.433
And I'm also
writing an e-mail.

03:25.738 --> 03:27.535
You apologized.
He accepted.

03:27.607 --> 03:29.802
That story has a beginning,
middle and an end.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.844
I screwed up his
life 15 years ago.

03:31.911 --> 03:33.811
I want to try
and make it right.

03:34.614 --> 03:36.275
Let it lie.

03:36.349 --> 03:40.718
I think we both know
I don't do that very well.

03:42.388 --> 03:45.687
Neither do I,
but I'm going to try
really hard with Sam.

03:45.758 --> 03:47.089
I know I hurt him.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.889
But I'm going to
give him some time.

03:48.962 --> 03:50.054
You should, too.

03:53.299 --> 03:54.391
Ivy's here.

03:54.867 --> 03:57.165
What?
Oh, come on.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.070
Oh, my God.
You didn't tell her yet?

04:00.139 --> 04:01.731
I didn't want to do
it over the phone.

04:01.808 --> 04:03.776
Besides,
she said she wanted to
call her first herself...

04:03.843 --> 04:04.867
Hi.

04:06.179 --> 04:08.647
Call who first?
What's going on?
Am I being...

04:08.715 --> 04:09.773
Don't worry.

04:09.849 --> 04:13.751
No, um, it's not anything bad.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.009
Um...

04:15.788 --> 04:18.779
Ivy, as you're our star,

04:18.858 --> 04:20.791
we want you to be
the first to know

04:20.860 --> 04:23.226
that we've cast the part
of Marilyn's mother, Gladys.

04:23.296 --> 04:24.593
Patti LuPone?

04:24.664 --> 04:27.895
No, but someone
a little closer to home.

04:27.967 --> 04:28.956
Oh, well,
who is it?

04:29.068 --> 04:31.127
Ivy, darling.

04:31.204 --> 04:32.899
And she's early.
Mom.

04:33.006 --> 04:36.237
I've been trying
to call you since I got
the offer last night,

04:36.309 --> 04:38.300
but you never
pick up your phone.

04:38.411 --> 04:39.503
Oh, my God.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.842
Look at that.
She's almost speechless.

04:41.914 --> 04:45.111
Think of it, Leigh Conroy
stepping out of retirement

04:45.184 --> 04:48.779
to play
the role of a lifetime,
the role only she can play,

04:48.855 --> 04:50.686
your mother.
She already has that role.

04:51.324 --> 04:54.418
Which is why I
haven't accepted it yet.

04:54.494 --> 04:58.328
I told them I would
only take it with
my daughter's blessing.

04:59.265 --> 05:02.166
<i>Ivy, Bombshell is
on track creatively.</i>

05:02.969 --> 05:07.770
But we simply need
something to support that
on the business side.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.637
And Leigh is
a very big draw.

05:09.742 --> 05:12.540
But none of us wants you
to be uncomfortable.

05:12.612 --> 05:17.879
Including me.
If you don't want me here,
I will completely understand.

05:17.950 --> 05:19.076
It's up to you.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.620
Should we at least try it?
What do you say?

05:22.822 --> 05:25.382
I say yay?

05:26.826 --> 05:28.726
Yay. Yay.

05:31.097 --> 05:33.292
Okay, Mom,
let's go say hi.

05:35.234 --> 05:36.724
That went well.

05:36.803 --> 05:38.134
It's only been five minutes.

05:38.204 --> 05:41.037
Who knows what'll happen
once the shock wears off?

05:41.474 --> 05:43.965
Well, whatever it is,
let's hope it's good.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.510
Ivy and Leigh working together

05:45.578 --> 05:48.376
<i>is the only reason
we're getting the Arts
cover of the Times.</i>

05:49.148 --> 05:51.173
It helps to be
friends with the editor.

05:51.284 --> 05:52.581
Pass along my
thanks to Richard?

05:52.685 --> 05:55.779
You can tell him yourself.
He'll be by later
with a photographer.

05:55.855 --> 05:58.847
Oh, good, who knows how
long this will last.

06:00.760 --> 06:05.220
<i>I pull myself together</i>

06:05.298 --> 06:07.459
<i>I'm focused on the prize</i>

06:07.533 --> 06:11.492
<i>I'm falling, baby,
through the sky
Through the sky</i>

06:11.604 --> 06:15.973
<i>I'm falling, baby,
through the sky</i>

06:16.042 --> 06:20.502
<i>It's my calling, baby
Don't you cry, don't you cry</i>

06:20.580 --> 06:24.016
<i>I'm falling down
through the sky</i>

06:24.117 --> 06:27.575
<i>It's a tune you can hum</i>

06:29.389 --> 06:32.790
<i>Oh, Broadway, here I come</i>

06:34.727 --> 06:38.720
<i>Mmm...</i>

06:40.767 --> 06:46.535
<i>Will I remain the same
or will I change a little bit?</i>

06:49.475 --> 06:56.472
<i>Will I feel broken
or totally complete?</i>

06:58.518 --> 07:03.888
<i>Will I retain my name
when I'm the biggest,
hugest hit...</i>

07:03.956 --> 07:05.685
All right,
stop there.

07:06.392 --> 07:08.724
We've got a big
day ahead of us.

07:10.897 --> 07:12.922
Oh, let a father be
proud of his daughter.

07:12.999 --> 07:16.696
I'm sorry.
I... I won't interrupt.

07:16.769 --> 07:19.203
Karen told me about
the big fundraiser
tonight. So...

07:19.272 --> 07:20.830
Well, I hope that you'll come.

07:20.907 --> 07:23.137
You can hear Karen sing this
in much nicer surroundings.

07:23.209 --> 07:24.767
About that.

07:24.844 --> 07:27.312
<i>Since tonight is
Hit List's introduction</i>

07:27.380 --> 07:29.780
to our board members and
the patrons of this theater,

07:29.849 --> 07:31.840
we want to wow them
with everything we've got.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.441
What are you thinking?

07:33.519 --> 07:35.419
Now that we have our Diva,
maybe we should show her off?

07:35.488 --> 07:37.683
Yeah, well, Karen is singing.
She's our star.

07:37.757 --> 07:40.624
I'm not taking
away her number.
Just adding another one.

07:40.693 --> 07:43.025
I'm thinking we should do
the Diva's number.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.960
Do we even have
time to pull this off?

07:45.031 --> 07:48.398
Almost definitely not,
but that's never
stopped me in the past.

07:48.901 --> 07:51.495
Number's in good shape.
Let's just run
it one more time.

07:51.571 --> 07:54.506
You never know,
our composer might
turn up at some point.

07:54.574 --> 07:55.905
I'd better, uh...
Dad.

07:56.242 --> 07:57.732
Just stay.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.710
And watch Ana rehearse.
She's amazing.

07:59.779 --> 08:01.770
I'm sure you
have your reasons,

08:01.848 --> 08:05.682
<i>but I still can't quite
see why you left
Bombshell for this.</i>

08:05.751 --> 08:07.150
It's a great show.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.950
It might not be Broadway,
but it's right for me.

08:10.022 --> 08:12.013
Just stay. You'll see.

08:12.091 --> 08:15.288
I can't say "no" to spending
more time with you.

08:15.361 --> 08:17.829
You sounded great.

08:17.897 --> 08:19.922
Like...
Okay. Yeah.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.897
Of course you'd oversleep
without me there.

08:23.970 --> 08:25.528
Hey, tell everybody
I'm on my way.

08:25.605 --> 08:27.004
What's gotten into you?

08:27.073 --> 08:28.665
You sound happy.

08:28.741 --> 08:30.106
Maybe I am.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.048

09:02.309 --> 09:03.776
Hi. Hi.

09:04.945 --> 09:08.108
I know this is
an incredibly
awkward situation.

09:08.181 --> 09:09.614
But my hands
were basically tied.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.674
When Eileen came up
with the idea to
hire your mother...

09:11.752 --> 09:14.084
Let's just see
how this goes, okay?

09:20.761 --> 09:25.198
Norma Jean and Gladys,
we are ready for your
very first rehearsal.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.559
Leigh. Feel free
to hold your script.
Yeah.

09:29.636 --> 09:31.968
I know you've barely
even had a chance to read it.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.405
Oh, read it?
I'm already memorized.

09:34.474 --> 09:36.169
Of course you are.

09:36.843 --> 09:39.141
Where do I stand?

09:39.212 --> 09:40.804
Right behind me.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.058
That looks cool.

09:58.599 --> 10:01.363
You wait till you see what
the guys at AntiGravity
have put together.

10:01.435 --> 10:04.495
If we pull this off,
we should raise
quite a few eyebrows tonight.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.738
Where's your dad?

10:06.807 --> 10:08.365
Oh, Scott's showing
him around.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.672
<i>He thinks I made a mistake
leaving Bombshell.</i>

10:11.745 --> 10:14.179
You took a risk.
We both did.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.545
I wish he could
look at it that way.

10:17.384 --> 10:18.442
Why don't you bring
him to the fundraiser?

10:18.518 --> 10:20.952
I don't know.
It's not really his thing.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.717
Watching his daughter perform?
He'd love it.

10:24.091 --> 10:25.183
Maybe.
Oh, okay.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.726
Uh, they're ready to fit
me for my costume now.

10:29.796 --> 10:30.922
Okay.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.358
Oh, Mr. Collins,

10:34.434 --> 10:37.198
how lovely of you to grace us
with your presence.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.760
Sorry I'm late.
Hey.

10:38.839 --> 10:39.965
Let's get started.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.632
Oh, we did already.

10:44.277 --> 10:47.075
Sweetheart,
I won't let them adopt you.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.711
I'm your family.
They're not.

10:50.784 --> 10:53.116
But you've never
treated me like family.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.551
They do.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.316
Please, let me go.

10:56.790 --> 11:00.351
I'm not just something
you can cut out of your life.

11:00.427 --> 11:01.451
Tom?

11:01.528 --> 11:02.825
All right.

11:02.896 --> 11:04.659
Let's pause here.

11:04.731 --> 11:05.720
Um...

11:12.005 --> 11:13.802
Come on. Over here.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.936
Why are they
being so nice?

11:19.012 --> 11:20.138
This is boring.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.680
I want my catfight already.

11:21.748 --> 11:23.079
All right. Um...

11:23.884 --> 11:27.650
I want to get behind
the choices both
of you are making.

11:27.721 --> 11:31.418
But I need some help
understanding them first.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.623
What's to understand?

11:33.860 --> 11:38.320
You're playing a very
contentious scene, uh,

11:38.398 --> 11:39.422
warmly.

11:40.600 --> 11:44.866
Norma Jean's my daughter.
I love her.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.969
She's asking you
to let the neighbors adopt her

11:48.041 --> 11:49.906
because you're
mentally unstable.

11:49.976 --> 11:53.036
And you don't seem very upset
that she's saying no.

11:53.780 --> 11:56.681
Why would I be upset?
I love my mother.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.541
She tried to kidnap you
when you were a small child

11:59.619 --> 12:01.553
by stuffing you
in a duffel bag.

12:01.621 --> 12:06.649
Proof that,
no matter how misguided,
Gladys cared about her.

12:11.198 --> 12:12.187
Richard.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.358
<i>I was about to call.
Good.</i>

12:14.735 --> 12:18.535
I'm about to meet my
photographer, and then
we were going to head over.

12:18.605 --> 12:20.163
<i>Is today okay?
Mmm...</i>

12:20.240 --> 12:22.538
It's okay,
but tomorrow
would be better.

12:22.809 --> 12:24.470
Deadline for
the weekend section

12:24.544 --> 12:26.409
is tomorrow.
Will you be ready?

12:26.480 --> 12:27.879
<i>I'll make sure of it.</i>

12:28.081 --> 12:31.414
Perhaps I can repay
you for your kindness
with dinner next week.

12:31.485 --> 12:33.919
Eileen Rand, are you
asking me out on a date?

12:34.121 --> 12:36.817
No, that would be
a conflict of interest.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.624
<i>That's right, and The New York
Times frowns on those.</i>

12:39.860 --> 12:43.455
<i>It's too bad, though.
That's the only reason
I signed on for this.</i>

12:43.964 --> 12:45.295
To spend some time with you.

12:45.398 --> 12:48.333
Well, let me get back to you.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.369
I'm sure I can
figure something out.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.838
Why isn't this working?

12:53.907 --> 12:54.931
They're being so polite,

12:55.041 --> 12:57.874
<i>they're turning
Norma Jean and Gladys
into the Gilmore Girls.</i>

12:57.944 --> 13:00.003
They're both amazing
actresses on their own.

13:00.080 --> 13:03.072
You just need to find
a way to get them there,
together.

13:03.150 --> 13:04.242
How?

13:04.317 --> 13:07.343
Directors use
a variety of methods
to get what they want.

13:07.621 --> 13:11.318
If you're not getting
the performance you want,
find another way.

13:12.692 --> 13:15.058
I shouldn't just
wait for them to
find it themselves?

13:15.128 --> 13:16.823
First week of
rehearsal? Sure.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.524
Week before tech?
Get in there.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.464
I have an idea.

13:21.535 --> 13:23.332
But it isn't pretty.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.530
Hey.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.969
Is everything okay?

13:30.343 --> 13:32.709
I hope you're not mad
at me for making you
leave this morning.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.576
No. No, I'm not mad.

13:35.081 --> 13:38.312
Good, 'cause this is
really strange for me.

13:39.252 --> 13:42.449
My dad's here,
he's asking me all these
questions about my life,

13:43.323 --> 13:47.953
and then in
the middle of all that,
there's what happened with us.

13:50.463 --> 13:52.795
You haven't told anybody,
right?

13:52.899 --> 13:54.890
Ana, Kyle. Derek.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.299
No. Why?

13:57.270 --> 14:00.706
We're working together.
It's better to
keep it between us.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.566
If that's what you want.

14:03.777 --> 14:05.301
No, no, I...

14:05.378 --> 14:07.744
I'm sorry.
No, it's not that. It's...

14:10.150 --> 14:11.947
What?
What is it?

14:12.018 --> 14:13.349
Um, I have to go.
I'm sorry.

14:15.121 --> 14:16.145
Not here.

14:16.923 --> 14:18.220
Let's go.

14:26.434 --> 14:28.265
Pretty nice
place you got here.

14:28.336 --> 14:29.667
What are you doing here?

14:29.770 --> 14:31.431
Huh? How'd you find me?

14:31.505 --> 14:34.497
You broke into my house, man,
I knew you was alive.

14:34.609 --> 14:36.804
Did a little digging.
And here you are.

14:37.678 --> 14:38.838
Dude, I don't have it.

14:39.780 --> 14:41.907
Even with all these posters
with your name on them?

14:42.016 --> 14:43.574
It's not anywhere
near what I owe you.

14:44.418 --> 14:45.908
Well, you'll find it.

14:46.520 --> 14:47.646
I know where you live.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.886
And I know where you work.

14:50.725 --> 14:53.159
Well, maybe I could meet
some of your new friends, huh?

14:54.161 --> 14:55.287
I need time.

14:58.032 --> 14:59.727
I'll see you soon.

15:08.910 --> 15:10.036
Mr. Cartwright.

15:10.111 --> 15:11.442
You're leaving already?

15:11.512 --> 15:15.107
Well, Karen's done,
so I thought I'd go.

15:15.182 --> 15:16.774
Uh, call me Roger.

15:16.884 --> 15:19.478
I've got a ticket
for tonight's benefit.

15:19.553 --> 15:21.919
Thought you might
like to see the star of
our show at her best.

15:21.989 --> 15:26.255
You're, uh...
You're very fond of
my daughter, aren't you?

15:27.061 --> 15:28.790
Yeah. She's a wonderful girl.

15:29.830 --> 15:30.854
But

15:31.899 --> 15:35.357
<i>give her the chance
to show you what
she left Bombshell for.</i>

15:37.338 --> 15:38.635
Nice jacket.

15:40.374 --> 15:41.705
Thank you?

15:46.047 --> 15:49.949
Sam, I'm so glad to
see you're back here.

15:50.051 --> 15:53.452
I know how sad Ivy was
when you left for the tour.

15:55.022 --> 15:56.683
Isn't this a hoot?

15:56.791 --> 15:59.726
When I got the offer,
I said to Tom,
"Go with your other options,"

15:59.827 --> 16:01.988
but he insisted.

16:02.096 --> 16:04.894
Huh. I thought it was
Eileen's choice.

16:04.966 --> 16:07.434
It was Eileen's idea,

16:07.501 --> 16:09.366
but Tom's decision.

16:09.437 --> 16:11.701
I had to say "yes"
just to get him off the phone.

16:13.674 --> 16:16.643
Now what exactly happened
between you two?

16:16.711 --> 16:19.509
Is there no chance
of patching things up?

16:22.550 --> 16:23.949
Julia.
Hmm?

16:24.852 --> 16:26.547
Are you free
tonight by any chance?

16:26.620 --> 16:28.850
I was just going
to hang out here
at rehearsal.

16:28.923 --> 16:31.255
Because Karen is
performing a number from

16:31.359 --> 16:33.691
Derek's new show at
the fundraiser tonight.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.492
And I was thinking
maybe we should

16:35.563 --> 16:37.258
go along and see
what they left us for.

16:37.398 --> 16:40.333
The fundraiser
for the Manhattan
Theatre Workshop?

16:40.434 --> 16:42.129
Correct.
Sure.

16:42.203 --> 16:43.830
Great. I'll be by
with my car at 8:00?

16:44.138 --> 16:45.162
Okay.
Good.

16:45.639 --> 16:46.628
Bye, Tom.

16:48.843 --> 16:50.640
All right.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.271
I know it's late and
we all want to get home.

16:53.347 --> 16:56.214
And we can,
once we get this right.

16:57.385 --> 16:58.374
Um...

16:59.286 --> 17:01.880
Let's turn up
the drama a little bit.

17:02.790 --> 17:03.950
When you're ready.

17:05.726 --> 17:08.387
Sweetheart,
I won't let them adopt you.

17:08.496 --> 17:12.990
Okay. So, this is
a mother-daughter scene.

17:13.067 --> 17:14.762
You are a mother and daughter.

17:14.835 --> 17:16.598
Let's draw on that.

17:16.771 --> 17:19.637
You grew up
with your mother
working on Broadway.

17:20.374 --> 17:21.534
What was that like?

17:21.608 --> 17:22.633
I don't really remember.

17:22.810 --> 17:26.040
Oh, what?
Of course you do.

17:26.113 --> 17:30.948
<i>I was performing
Anything Goes the whole time
I was pregnant with Ivy.</i>

17:31.018 --> 17:34.510
She tap-danced
along right with me
the whole first trimester.

17:34.622 --> 17:37.614
And you won a Tony
for that role, right?

17:37.691 --> 17:39.158
Yep. Yep.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.687
I wasn't even 30 years old.

17:42.229 --> 17:43.218
I'm sorry, what?

17:44.231 --> 17:46.426
I was 27 when I had you.

17:46.534 --> 17:48.661
According to what calendar?

17:48.736 --> 17:51.296
Take what you're feeling now,
do the scene. Go.

17:51.372 --> 17:53.806
Tom. Tom, you'll love this.

17:53.874 --> 17:56.638
When Ivy was eight years old,

17:58.879 --> 18:01.871
She got fat all of a sudden...

18:01.949 --> 18:02.938
Mom.

18:03.017 --> 18:04.177
No, no, no.
Just briefly.

18:04.251 --> 18:07.414
Then you got very thin, dear.
But don't be so uptight.

18:07.855 --> 18:12.121
But anyway,
in this brief moment in time,

18:12.193 --> 18:14.991
<i>I was playing Maria
in Sound of Music.</i>

18:15.062 --> 18:17.553
And Ivy, she just so
desperately wanted to

18:17.631 --> 18:20.293
audition for one of
the von Trapp children.

18:20.367 --> 18:25.862
So I begged the producers,
and they agreed
to bring her in

18:26.941 --> 18:28.806
for Kurt.

18:32.079 --> 18:33.842
It was a boy.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.875
You know what?
Maybe we should...

18:36.951 --> 18:39.442
Did I ever tell you
about the time that

18:39.520 --> 18:41.954
my mother came to
visit me at theater camp?

18:42.056 --> 18:43.785
I don't think I
remember that one.

18:43.858 --> 18:44.984
Oh, sure, you do.

18:45.059 --> 18:46.924
It was the summer
before eighth grade.

18:46.994 --> 18:49.224
<i>You came to see me
in Into the Woods.</i>

18:49.530 --> 18:52.988
It was my first real role,
and she was upstaging me
even then.

18:53.067 --> 18:54.694
But that wasn't
the worst part.

18:54.768 --> 18:56.565
Ancient history, Ivy.

18:57.004 --> 19:00.462
I was Little Red,
and Christina Nicholson
was Cinderella.

19:00.941 --> 19:02.636
Christina got
a standing ovation.

19:02.743 --> 19:05.143
And you said,
"If you were born with

19:05.212 --> 19:07.476
"the talent she has,
that could have been you.

19:08.883 --> 19:10.282
"But you weren't.

19:10.351 --> 19:12.512
"So you're gonna have to
work that much harder."

19:15.556 --> 19:18.184
And you did work
that much harder.

19:18.292 --> 19:19.281
The scene?

19:19.527 --> 19:21.427
And here we are.

19:21.495 --> 19:22.962
I am here.

19:23.931 --> 19:25.489
And you shouldn't be.

19:26.267 --> 19:29.100
But of course, when I
finally get my big shot,

19:29.203 --> 19:31.364
you have to show
up and remind me

19:31.438 --> 19:33.372
that I'm still
not good enough.

19:34.041 --> 19:35.736
Well, guess what?

19:36.143 --> 19:38.873
At least the best
part of my career
is still ahead of me.

19:55.129 --> 19:59.463
<i>Broadway, here I come</i>

19:59.533 --> 20:03.526
<i>Broadway, here I come</i>

20:03.771 --> 20:08.538
<i>Broadway, here I come</i>

20:08.609 --> 20:15.606
<i>Broadway, here I come</i>

20:17.051 --> 20:19.576
<i>And the last thing I hear</i>

20:21.555 --> 20:25.047
<i>As the impact grows near</i>

20:25.759 --> 20:32.688
<i>Is it a scream or a cheer?</i>

20:33.434 --> 20:36.198
<i>Well, never mind,
I'll never find out</i>

20:36.270 --> 20:38.363
<i>'Cause Broadway, I am here</i>

20:48.215 --> 20:50.410
That, right there,
is a star.

20:51.352 --> 20:54.378
Yeah, she could have been,
if you'd let her.

20:55.122 --> 20:56.419
Excuse me?

20:56.824 --> 21:01.261
I've been reading about you,
how you treat the women
who work for you.

21:03.063 --> 21:05.588
My daughter threw away
her Broadway dreams,

21:05.666 --> 21:08.567
dreams she's had
since she was so
little I could hold her,

21:08.636 --> 21:10.126
all to follow you down here.

21:10.371 --> 21:13.204
I have nothing but respect
for your daughter, sir.

21:13.707 --> 21:16.198
It was entirely her decision.
It was nothing to do with me.

21:17.645 --> 21:21.012
A man would stand up
and admit his
role in all this.

21:23.017 --> 21:25.611
A boy would
sneak out the window.

21:27.721 --> 21:29.348
That was great.

21:30.057 --> 21:31.684
Hey, thanks. Um...

21:32.226 --> 21:35.024
So, I was, um...
I was...

21:35.929 --> 21:41.026
I wanted to ask you
for an advance on my money.

21:41.902 --> 21:44.598
It's just, it's hard to,
to work shifts

21:44.672 --> 21:47.607
at the restaurant
when I'm in rehearsal.

21:47.675 --> 21:51.167
Sorry to break it to you,
but this is nonprofit theater.

21:51.879 --> 21:55.076
Well, I mean, what about
all these people? Aren't they,
aren't they supporting us?

21:55.416 --> 21:56.678
I mean,
they don't look so hard up.

21:57.017 --> 21:58.746
They keep the lights on.

21:58.819 --> 22:00.514
Is there something wrong?

22:02.523 --> 22:04.184
No, hey. Forget it.

22:06.460 --> 22:10.123
Too bad my restraining order
hasn't been processed yet.

22:10.197 --> 22:13.792
I didn't come
to see you, I came to
support your theater.

22:13.867 --> 22:17.268
Is that why you
bid on so many items
in the silent auction?

22:17.338 --> 22:20.637
I just really think that
that spa weekend
is a good deal.

22:20.708 --> 22:22.573
You're trying too hard.

22:22.643 --> 22:23.735
I feel terrible.

22:23.811 --> 22:25.108
I noticed.

22:28.482 --> 22:29.915
Eileen Rand?

22:30.017 --> 22:31.609
What a surprise.

22:32.753 --> 22:34.880
You missed
Karen Cartwright.
I did.

22:35.255 --> 22:36.745
I'm glad you got a ticket.

22:37.591 --> 22:39.582
Apparently I'm at table four.

22:40.194 --> 22:42.958
Huh. That's interesting,
'cause so am I.

22:43.964 --> 22:45.522
It's a miracle.

22:48.268 --> 22:50.065
Oh, my God,
you won't believe who's here.

22:50.137 --> 22:52.435
<i>Richard Francis,
Arts editor of
The New York Times.</i>

22:52.506 --> 22:54.599
He's gonna watch
you shut it down.

22:54.675 --> 22:56.199
Oh, I didn't think I
could get more nervous.

22:56.276 --> 22:57.743
Don't be.
You're gonna be great.

22:58.078 --> 23:00.308
Hey, where's Jimmy?
I was kind of
hoping he was in here.

23:00.381 --> 23:01.370
I need to talk to him.

23:01.482 --> 23:03.109
Yeah. He's been
acting weird all day.

23:03.183 --> 23:04.309
Yeah, I noticed.

23:04.385 --> 23:06.444
Is everything okay?
Did something happen?

23:06.520 --> 23:07.987
Ana, we're ready.

23:08.355 --> 23:09.720
Okay.

23:21.668 --> 23:27.072
<i>I could fall in love with you</i>

23:27.841 --> 23:32.676
<i>I could fall in love</i>

23:33.914 --> 23:39.477
<i>In my dreams your
dreams come true</i>

23:39.853 --> 23:44.415
<i>Say you'll dream of us</i>

23:44.491 --> 23:51.260
<i>At night when
the bright stars are burning
high over Manhattan</i>

23:51.598 --> 23:56.763
<i>All washed out in
neon and hidden from view</i>

23:56.837 --> 24:03.436
<i>But when the power goes out
and you look up from Brooklyn</i>

24:03.510 --> 24:09.107
<i>Will you reach for me
reaching out for you?</i>

24:09.183 --> 24:15.418
<i>Oh, will you reach for me
reaching out for you?</i>

24:18.158 --> 24:22.618
<i>Reaching out for you</i>

24:25.766 --> 24:31.602
<i>I can tell you're unprepared</i>

24:31.672 --> 24:37.201
<i>For what will happen next</i>

24:37.811 --> 24:43.545
<i>Nothing now
could change my mind</i>

24:43.617 --> 24:48.577
<i>Or make me want you less</i>

24:49.756 --> 24:52.122
<i>Do you want this tonight?</i>

24:52.192 --> 24:58.859
<i>When the bright
stars are burning
high over Manhattan</i>

24:58.966 --> 25:03.733
<i>All washed out in neon
and hidden from view</i>

25:03.837 --> 25:10.436
<i>But when the power goes out
and you look up from Brooklyn</i>

25:10.511 --> 25:16.347
<i>Will you reach for me
reaching out for you?</i>

25:16.416 --> 25:21.649
<i>Oh, will you reach for me
reaching out for you?</i>

25:24.858 --> 25:27.349
<i>Would you reach for me?</i>

25:29.329 --> 25:32.730
<i>I could wait for you</i>

25:33.867 --> 25:36.665
<i>Would you reach for me?</i>

25:37.471 --> 25:39.735
<i>Bright stars are burning...</i>

25:39.806 --> 25:42.001
Hey, they need you downstairs
like, right away.
Oh.

25:42.075 --> 25:43.099
<i>... high over Manhattan</i>

25:43.176 --> 25:47.943
<i>All washed out in
neon and hidden from view</i>

25:48.015 --> 25:54.682
<i>But when the power goes out
and you look up from Brooklyn</i>

25:54.755 --> 26:00.352
<i>Will you reach for me
reaching out for you?</i>

26:00.427 --> 26:07.196
<i>Oh, will you reach for me
reaching out for you?</i>

26:07.267 --> 26:12.967
<i>Will you reach for me
reaching out for you?</i>

26:15.475 --> 26:20.503
<i>Reaching out for you?</i>

26:21.448 --> 26:26.147
<i>I'm reaching out for you</i>

26:27.554 --> 26:32.787
<i>I'm reaching out for you</i>

26:45.806 --> 26:47.330
Hi, Jimmy.

26:50.445 --> 26:51.969
Patek Philippe.

26:53.648 --> 26:54.808
Score.

26:54.882 --> 26:56.873
I... I can explain.
I wouldn't bother.

26:58.519 --> 26:59.850
It's pretty obvious.

27:00.888 --> 27:02.913
Derek, I'm in trouble, okay?

27:09.230 --> 27:10.629
All right. Go on.

27:13.534 --> 27:15.729
I mean, it's this guy I know,

27:17.205 --> 27:19.400
this dealer,
I used to work for him.

27:19.507 --> 27:23.603
And buy from him,
and crash with
him and his friends.

27:23.678 --> 27:24.838
Okay.

27:24.912 --> 27:27.278
Okay, but I got out of there,
like, a year ago.

27:27.348 --> 27:30.442
It's just I needed some
cash for a clean start.

27:30.518 --> 27:33.316
How much did
you take from him?

27:33.388 --> 27:34.582
Eight grand.

27:44.666 --> 27:46.099
Why didn't you just ask me?

27:46.734 --> 27:48.326
Are you kidding?

27:48.403 --> 27:50.496
I thought you and I
are becoming friends.

27:50.605 --> 27:52.630
Believe it or not,

27:52.707 --> 27:56.268
you don't have a monopoly
on youthful indiscretion.

27:56.944 --> 27:59.071
Hey.
What are you doing in here?

27:59.147 --> 28:01.911
Uh, fetching our
coats in your absence.

28:01.983 --> 28:04.543
Oh, look at that.
They match. Catch.

28:09.123 --> 28:10.112
Big night.

28:10.758 --> 28:11.747
Ambitious.

28:13.161 --> 28:14.355
You could say that.

28:14.429 --> 28:15.589
Were your patrons pleased?

28:15.697 --> 28:18.097
I hope so.
What'd you think?

28:18.166 --> 28:20.691
Oh, I thought it
was extraordinary.

28:20.902 --> 28:22.870
You and I used to
try stuff like this.

28:22.937 --> 28:23.926
Mmm-hmm.

28:24.439 --> 28:28.000
Think about what we
could have pulled off
if we had stuck together.

28:28.076 --> 28:29.566
I do think about it.

28:29.677 --> 28:31.201
More and more lately.

28:32.547 --> 28:37.416
But if what I did
got you to this place,
I no longer feel guilty.

28:39.654 --> 28:41.144
You're onto
something here.

28:41.255 --> 28:44.486
I'm just glad I stalked
you so I could see it.

28:44.726 --> 28:46.717
Well, I hope
you don't stop.

28:47.528 --> 28:48.893
I'm getting used to you.

28:51.933 --> 28:53.491
Ooh.
There you are.

28:54.102 --> 28:57.230
Hey, Roger,
you've met our composer,
Jimmy Collins?

28:57.305 --> 28:58.670
Hello, Jimmy, uh...

29:03.144 --> 29:05.374
Karen, uh, walk me out.

29:05.480 --> 29:07.471
It's late,
I'm going to get a cab.

29:07.715 --> 29:08.773
Okay.

29:09.550 --> 29:11.643
You, my dear,
were a vision.
Oh, thanks.

29:12.720 --> 29:13.914
I'm betting
the house on you guys.

29:13.988 --> 29:15.114
Well, she killed it, so...

29:15.723 --> 29:18.920
Derek, great to see you,
as usual.

29:19.994 --> 29:21.052
Interesting show.

29:21.129 --> 29:22.391
<i>Richard Francis,
New York Times.</i>

29:22.463 --> 29:23.452
Scott Nichols.

29:23.531 --> 29:25.396
As I'm new in town,
I've yet to have the pleasure.

29:26.868 --> 29:28.802
Is this the team
behind that number?
Yes.

29:28.870 --> 29:30.929
And this
is the sprite.

29:31.172 --> 29:32.230
Spinning in the air.

29:32.406 --> 29:33.668
Yes, I'm Ana.

29:33.741 --> 29:36.539
Uh, she plays the Diva.
That was her song
in the first act.

29:37.378 --> 29:39.403
Well, I can't wait to see
what she does in the second.

29:39.514 --> 29:41.038
She is all
over the place.

29:41.115 --> 29:42.480
Well, we'll leave you to it.

29:42.550 --> 29:45.348
I'm so looking
forward to seeing
where all this goes.

29:45.419 --> 29:46.681
- Let's talk.
- Sure.

29:46.754 --> 29:47.880
Soon.
Of course.

29:50.892 --> 29:53.224
Okay, I am literally
waiting to exhale.

29:53.294 --> 29:55.626
Dude, "all over the place"?
The Diva only has one song.

29:55.730 --> 29:57.630
Not anymore.
Forget the patrons.

29:57.732 --> 30:02.032
<i>That man is the only
fan Hit List needs.
If he says jump, we fly.</i>

30:02.570 --> 30:04.162
Here we are.

30:04.672 --> 30:10.008
Well, that was fun. And see,
no conflict of interest.

30:10.978 --> 30:12.138
Let's keep it that way.

30:12.346 --> 30:16.214
Look, I want to
spend time with you.

30:17.185 --> 30:20.052
So I had a thought.

30:21.355 --> 30:23.653
<i>Why don't I give
the Bombshell story
to another writer?</i>

30:24.192 --> 30:25.557
Do I still get the cover?

30:25.626 --> 30:26.923
Sure.

30:27.061 --> 30:29.791
I thought you
were looking forward
to writing it.

30:29.864 --> 30:32.662
I'll find something
else to write about.

30:36.137 --> 30:39.265
I'm sorry if things got
a little tense back there.

30:41.442 --> 30:42.704
I'm not.

30:42.810 --> 30:45.938
It felt good
to say the things
that needed to be said.

30:46.013 --> 30:50.143
You mean that terrible story
about how I never missed
your shows growing up

30:50.218 --> 30:51.947
and taught you to work hard?

30:52.019 --> 30:54.044
What a bad mother I've been.

30:54.121 --> 30:55.816
You never should
have taken this job.

30:55.923 --> 30:58.790
They need me.
You need me.

30:58.860 --> 31:00.020
No, I don't.

31:00.094 --> 31:02.756
You may be
a star in the making,
but you're not there yet.

31:02.864 --> 31:05.492
Your name can't
open this show.

31:05.566 --> 31:08.797
But ours can,
the two of us together.

31:08.870 --> 31:10.804
We may need you
to open the show,

31:10.872 --> 31:13.966
but after that,
I'll never need you again.

31:22.683 --> 31:26.210
<i>I finally understand
about why you left Bombshell.</i>

31:26.287 --> 31:28.187
You left because
of that composer.

31:28.256 --> 31:30.281
The one I saw
sneaking out your
window this morning.

31:30.358 --> 31:31.347
Dad...

31:31.459 --> 31:33.484
You've never
even mentioned him
to your mom and me.

31:33.561 --> 31:35.495
Who is he?
What's his story?

31:35.730 --> 31:37.857
I just don't want
you to make a mistake.

31:37.932 --> 31:39.524
Jimmy's important to me.

31:39.767 --> 31:43.669
This show is, too.
So if this is all a mistake,
it's too late,

31:44.171 --> 31:45.297
I already made it.

31:48.843 --> 31:50.435
I guess you did.

32:06.561 --> 32:10.827
When I was a film cutter
at RKO, after work,

32:10.899 --> 32:13.561
me and the girls
would sometimes

32:13.635 --> 32:18.766
drive all the ways down
to the Santa Monica
Pier and go dancing.

32:19.641 --> 32:21.609
I should have come to see you,

32:21.677 --> 32:24.737
but I knew you were better off
where you were.

32:27.115 --> 32:29.413
Oh, Norma Jean,
I'm so sorry.

32:29.484 --> 32:32.647
Mama, I'm Marilyn now.

32:33.055 --> 32:35.114
I haven't been
Norma Jean in years.

32:35.524 --> 32:39.460
Baby, I wish I was
back in the cutting room.

32:39.528 --> 32:43.862
I'd take all these
pieces of our lives

32:43.932 --> 32:46.765
and I'd make
something beautiful.

32:49.905 --> 32:53.170
<i>If our lives were a movie</i>

32:53.241 --> 32:55.573
<i>I'd know what to do</i>

32:56.278 --> 33:00.578
<i>I'd write every
scene with my heart</i>

33:01.917 --> 33:04.545
<i>An RKO picture</i>

33:04.619 --> 33:07.486
<i>That stars me and you</i>

33:07.823 --> 33:11.816
<i>And this time
I'd learn my part</i>

33:14.229 --> 33:17.027
<i>I'd paint you some scenery</i>

33:17.099 --> 33:19.624
<i>We'd sing and we'd dance</i>

33:20.002 --> 33:24.735
<i>From morning to late afternoon</i>

33:25.440 --> 33:28.534
<i>And when that scene is done</i>

33:28.610 --> 33:31.135
<i>Then I'd take down the sun</i>

33:31.213 --> 33:33.511
<i>And for you, darling</i>

33:33.582 --> 33:35.982
<i>I'll hang the moon</i>

33:40.756 --> 33:45.523
<i>We'd wake up to sunshine
like lights on a set</i>

33:46.595 --> 33:50.964
<i>You'd reach out
and there'd be my hand</i>

33:52.034 --> 33:54.901
<i>All day there'd be music</i>

33:54.970 --> 33:57.768
<i>A perfect duet</i>

33:57.839 --> 34:02.242
<i>That flows from
the white baby grand</i>

34:03.879 --> 34:06.370
<i>At night when
you're frightened</i>

34:06.448 --> 34:08.916
<i>I'd play you to sleep</i>

34:09.384 --> 34:14.981
<i>That melody from Clair de Lune</i>

34:15.056 --> 34:17.924
<i>And to fill up the sky</i>

34:18.025 --> 34:20.722
<i>Past the clouds I would fly</i>

34:20.829 --> 34:23.092
<i>And for you, darling</i>

34:23.165 --> 34:24.826
<i>I'll hang the moon</i>

34:26.101 --> 34:29.831
<i>Hang the moon forever</i>

34:29.905 --> 34:34.069
<i>So you'd never
fear the darkness</i>

34:34.609 --> 34:37.077
<i>The darkness I've known</i>

34:37.846 --> 34:40.906
<i>Moon, protect Norma Jean</i>

34:41.116 --> 34:45.143
<i>So that she'll never be alone</i>

34:46.822 --> 34:48.312
<i>Never alone</i>

34:50.058 --> 34:55.188
<i>If our lives were a movie
then you'd be the star</i>

34:55.263 --> 35:00.030
<i>'Cause now I know
the role I should play</i>

35:00.735 --> 35:03.431
<i>To applaud all you do</i>

35:03.572 --> 35:06.302
<i>All the things that you are</i>

35:06.374 --> 35:10.777
<i>And just be there
on opening day</i>

35:12.814 --> 35:15.112
<i>I know in the past</i>

35:15.183 --> 35:18.016
<i>That the lines were all wrong</i>

35:18.086 --> 35:23.456
<i>And the music
was never in tune</i>

35:23.525 --> 35:26.187
<i>But the wish that I make</i>

35:26.261 --> 35:29.128
<i>Is for just one more take</i>

35:29.197 --> 35:31.188
<i>Because then, darling</i>

35:31.266 --> 35:34.531
<i>I'll hang the moon</i>

35:36.705 --> 35:40.607
<i>I'll hang the moon
above you</i>

35:40.675 --> 35:47.672
<i>So you never fear the darkness
the darkness of night</i>

35:48.850 --> 35:51.819
<i>Then you'll know I love you</i>

35:51.887 --> 35:56.153
<i>Each time that
you feel the light</i>

35:57.659 --> 35:59.149
<i>Feel the light</i>

36:01.129 --> 36:06.192
<i>If our lives were a movie
then I'd cut away</i>

36:06.268 --> 36:10.568
<i>All the moments
when I wasn't there</i>

36:12.707 --> 36:15.403
<i>The scenes that are happy</i>

36:15.510 --> 36:17.876
<i>Are all that will stay</i>

36:18.346 --> 36:22.544
<i>The rest will
dissolve into air</i>

36:24.486 --> 36:31.119
<i>As the final reel ends
we might both shed a tear</i>

36:31.193 --> 36:36.790
<i>For the ending
is coming up soon</i>

36:37.966 --> 36:41.766
<i>But when the screen
fades to black</i>

36:42.771 --> 36:46.798
<i>We can smile and look back</i>

36:48.109 --> 36:50.600
<i>And for you, darling</i>

36:50.845 --> 36:57.842
<i>I'll hang the moon</i>

37:22.844 --> 37:23.936
Well, that should do it.

37:24.012 --> 37:25.639
We've got some work
we can get on with

37:25.714 --> 37:27.443
while you go and
visit your friend.

37:27.515 --> 37:29.142
He can wait.

37:29.217 --> 37:30.445
Yeah, but he shouldn't.

37:30.518 --> 37:32.076
Handle it now.

37:34.856 --> 37:36.790
Thanks.
Sure.

37:45.033 --> 37:48.196
Sorry. I was awful
hard on you last night.

37:48.270 --> 37:50.170
I just want you
to be happy,

37:50.238 --> 37:52.001
and if that boy
makes you happy,

37:52.073 --> 37:54.337
then that's all
that matters to me.

37:54.409 --> 37:55.740
Thank you.

37:57.178 --> 37:58.338
Jimmy.

37:58.813 --> 38:02.305
Uh, your show
seems interesting.

38:03.351 --> 38:06.013
I look forward to
seeing the rest of it
on opening night.

38:07.355 --> 38:09.585
Maybe we could
all have dinner.

38:11.493 --> 38:13.518
Uh, yeah,
I'd like that.

38:14.863 --> 38:16.194
Good. Good.

38:16.264 --> 38:18.391
Roger. You're not
staying for rehearsal?

38:18.566 --> 38:20.227
No, I was just saying
good-bye to my daughter.

38:20.302 --> 38:21.997
I've got to get
to my conference.

38:22.070 --> 38:23.833
Oh. Let's get you a cab.

38:25.674 --> 38:27.665
So, you told your dad, huh?

38:27.742 --> 38:29.767
He saw you.
Out my window.

38:29.844 --> 38:30.902
Oops.

38:31.613 --> 38:35.014
Hey, look. I know that
I've been weird lately.

38:35.817 --> 38:38.513
I just want you to know
it's not you. I've just...

38:38.586 --> 38:40.076
I've had a lot on my mind,

38:40.155 --> 38:43.056
but it's gonna be
all good now. Okay?

38:43.124 --> 38:44.216
Taxi.
Okay.

38:45.827 --> 38:48.387
Uh, I owe you
an apology, Derek.

38:49.164 --> 38:50.495
No, there's no need.

38:50.565 --> 38:51.827
No, I do.
I was wrong.

38:52.067 --> 38:54.058
I thought you and
my daughter were together.

38:54.135 --> 38:56.262
But it wasn't you I saw.

38:57.505 --> 38:59.473
Good luck with the show.

39:10.251 --> 39:12.242
Hi.
Hey.

39:12.887 --> 39:15.048
I took the liberty of
ordering your usual.

39:17.325 --> 39:18.849
You remember
from 15 years ago?

39:20.462 --> 39:21.451
Hmm.

39:24.332 --> 39:27.529
Wow. You do. Okay.

39:29.971 --> 39:31.302
Hey, let me
ask you something.

39:31.373 --> 39:34.501
How do you turn
an ancillary character
into a second lead?

39:35.543 --> 39:36.976
Well, off the top
of my head, he...

39:37.045 --> 39:38.535
She.

39:38.613 --> 39:40.843
...would have to
play off the hero.

39:40.915 --> 39:44.578
So you make her a villain
or a cautionary tale.

39:45.053 --> 39:47.385
I'd have to look
at the material.
Why do you ask?

39:48.690 --> 39:52.558
I want to give
you the chance you

39:52.627 --> 39:55.892
so desperately want
to make it up to me.

39:57.932 --> 39:59.763
My show needs your help.

40:00.702 --> 40:02.431
How do you feel
about being a dramaturg?

40:02.504 --> 40:03.937
Oh.

40:05.373 --> 40:08.342
Um, if you had asked
me six months ago,
I would have said not good.

40:08.410 --> 40:10.071
Look, I'm not asking
you to be one.

40:10.145 --> 40:12.909
I'm just asking you to read it
and give me your thoughts.

40:12.981 --> 40:15.745
I know you have
your own show.

40:16.484 --> 40:17.610
I thought this
was sung through.

40:17.685 --> 40:20.745
It's the story
that needs help,
not the music.

40:21.890 --> 40:23.619
And you know story.

40:25.226 --> 40:26.818
Does Derek know?

40:27.429 --> 40:30.830
You'd be doing
this for me, not him.

40:35.103 --> 40:36.092
Okay.

40:42.977 --> 40:44.274
That was amazing.

40:44.345 --> 40:46.313
Who's going to love that?
I know.

40:46.414 --> 40:47.938
How about everyone
who has a mother?

40:49.517 --> 40:52.418
I know bringing Leigh on board
has been a challenge for you,

40:52.487 --> 40:55.217
but you've got to admit,
it's been worth it so far.

40:55.290 --> 40:57.815
Maybe for the show,
but it's been torture for me.

40:58.560 --> 41:00.027
Sam told me everything.

41:00.628 --> 41:03.495
You knew how hard it was
going to be for me to work
with the woman

41:03.598 --> 41:07.329
whose shadow
I've spent my entire
life trying to escape.

41:08.269 --> 41:09.463
And you still hired her.

41:09.938 --> 41:11.405
I'm doing what's
right for the show.

41:12.774 --> 41:14.173
And so am I.

41:14.242 --> 41:15.607
We're not friends.

41:15.677 --> 41:18.168
I work for you now,
and that's it.

41:28.256 --> 41:29.689
Look at that.

41:29.891 --> 41:31.358
It's all there.

41:32.193 --> 41:33.421
Yeah. We good?

41:33.761 --> 41:35.490
Oh, better than.

41:35.730 --> 41:38.324
Man, the last thing
I ever thought

41:38.399 --> 41:40.765
I'd see from
you is 8,000 cash.

41:41.135 --> 41:43.660
You wanna come inside,
hang out, old times' sake?

41:43.738 --> 41:45.433
I never want to see you again.

41:47.075 --> 41:49.805
Well, you want a little
something for the road?

41:56.284 --> 41:57.979
Have a good one, Collins.

41:59.053 --> 42:01.146
It's Collins now, right?

42:03.858 --> 42:06.554
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.
