WEBVTT

00:02.803 --> 00:04.338
HOLDEN, THAT'S
A SERIOUS BRUISE!

00:04.372 --> 00:05.639
THE ULCER'S
COMPLETELY UNDER CONTROL.

00:05.673 --> 00:07.341
I'M TOTALLY
OKAY TO SWIM AGAIN.

00:07.375 --> 00:09.277
IT'S NOT MY CALL.
I HAVE TO TALK TO
THE PRINCIPAL.

00:09.310 --> 00:10.711
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY
MADE A NEW FRIEND.

00:10.744 --> 00:12.480
DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE
THOSE TWO HOOKING UP.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.115
JASON'S PARENTS
BEGGED ME

00:14.148 --> 00:15.749
TO CHANGE THE DATE
ON THE FORMER WILL.

00:15.783 --> 00:17.385
THEY DIDN'T WANT
THEIR SON

00:17.418 --> 00:19.320
TO LOOK LIKE
THE NUMBER ONE SUSPECT.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.189
I'VE SEEN ALI
 WITH DARK HAIR BEFORE.

00:21.222 --> 00:23.091
I'M PRETENDING
TO BE SOMEONE ELSE.

00:23.124 --> 00:25.126
MAYBE ALI FOUND A WAY
TO FLY UNDER HIS RADAR.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.294
BY BEING SOMEONE ELSE?

00:26.327 --> 00:27.495
BRUNETTE ON THE I.D.

00:27.528 --> 00:28.696
"VIVIAN DARKBLOOM"
IS A PSEUDONYM

00:28.729 --> 00:30.431
FOR VLADIMIR NABOKOV.

00:30.464 --> 00:32.133
YOU DIDN'T JUST
SEND IT TO US--

00:32.165 --> 00:33.301
YOU SENT IT TO EVERYBODY
IN YOUR ADDRESS BOOK.

00:33.334 --> 00:34.635
I DIDN'T DO THIS!

00:35.803 --> 00:37.238
( ticking )

00:49.250 --> 00:51.519
( cellphone rings )

00:54.388 --> 00:56.324
( ring )

00:58.692 --> 01:00.494
( ring )

01:04.632 --> 01:05.733
MRS. MARIN?

01:05.766 --> 01:07.335
YES.
YES.

01:16.144 --> 01:18.412
THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT
FROM ALI'S CLAIM TICKET?

01:18.446 --> 01:19.847
THAT'S WHAT THEY GAVE ME.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.550
SO, BASICALLY, YOU PICKED
UP HER DRY CLEANING.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.486
I JUST CAN'T EVER PICTURE
ALISON WEARING THIS.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.488
WELL, PICTURE
VIVIAN DARKBLOOM.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.357
SO NOW WE'RE SAYING
THIS VIVIAN DARKPERSON

01:29.390 --> 01:30.758
HAD HER OWN WARDROBE TOO?

01:32.393 --> 01:33.527
THIS IS SO WEIRD.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.264
CAN I TOUCH IT?

01:36.297 --> 01:39.467
YEAH, IT'S A RAINCOAT, ARIA,
IT'S NOT A MUMMY.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.302
WHERE'S HANNA?

01:41.335 --> 01:43.637
SHE AND HER MOM HAD TO MEET
WITH TAMBORELLI BEFORE SCHOOL.

01:43.671 --> 01:45.839
YEAH. KATE'S MOM
PRINTED OUT THAT
NAKED PICTURE

01:45.873 --> 01:47.308
AND SHE'S
THREATENING TO SUE.

01:47.341 --> 01:48.542
SHE WANTS BLOOD.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.911
HANNA'S.
YEAH. PROBABLY MINE TOO.

01:50.944 --> 01:54.582
I'M THE ONE WHO TOLD HER
THAT KATE USED TO BE CALLED
"BOIL N' BAGGIES."

01:54.615 --> 01:55.816
WHO TOLD "A"?

01:55.849 --> 01:57.718
WHO TELLS "A" ANYTHING?

01:57.751 --> 02:02.323
THAT PLAN WAS PROBABLY
IN MOTION THE MOMENT
KATE WALKED INTO SCHOOL.

02:02.356 --> 02:04.292
GUYS, CHECK IT OUT.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.693
WHAT IS THAT?

02:05.726 --> 02:07.695
IT'S A PHONE NUMBER.
WHOSE?

02:07.728 --> 02:09.197
UH... THERE'S NO NAME.

02:09.229 --> 02:10.264
LET'S CALL IT.

02:10.298 --> 02:11.565
OKAY, STOP.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.401
NOW I FEEL LIKE
WE'RE IN A BAD PLACE.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.903
WE'RE IN MY
LIVING ROOM, EMILY.
WE ARE HOLDING A COAT.

02:15.936 --> 02:17.671
YEAH, THAT BELONGS TO SOMEONE
WHO'S NO LONGER ALIVE.

02:17.705 --> 02:18.672
EM.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.408
HOW CAN WE NOT CALL THIS?

02:20.441 --> 02:22.376
OKAY, WHOEVER THIS IS
MAY HAVE SOME ANSWERS,

02:22.410 --> 02:25.213
LIKE WHY ON EARTH DID
ALISON NEED TO BE THIS
VIVIAN PERSON?

02:25.246 --> 02:27.315
YEAH, AND WHO WAS VIVIAN
MEETING, AND WHY?

02:27.348 --> 02:28.882
YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA
FIND THAT OUT FROM
A NUMBER IN A POCKET?

02:28.916 --> 02:30.951
WELL, IT'S PROBABLY EASIER
THAN HIRING THE FAT LADY

02:30.984 --> 02:32.453
WITH THE TUBE TOP
AT THE FARMER'S MARKET

02:32.486 --> 02:33.587
WHO'S GONNA
TELL YOU YOUR FORTUNE,

02:33.621 --> 02:34.722
BUT IF YOU'RE TOO SCARED--

02:34.755 --> 02:35.756
I'M NOT SCARED!

02:40.761 --> 02:42.563
( cellphone dialing )
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT OUR FORTUNES...

02:42.596 --> 02:43.831
BUT THAT LADY
WITH THE TUBE TOP

02:43.864 --> 02:45.299
MAKES REALLY GOOD
APPLE BUTTER.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.600
HELLO?

02:46.634 --> 02:47.868
'KAY, WHAT IF
WE KNOW THIS PERSON?

02:47.901 --> 02:49.603
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY?

02:49.637 --> 02:50.804
Female Voice: THE MOBILE
 SUBSCRIBER AT 215...

02:50.838 --> 02:52.406
IT WENT TO VOICEMAIL.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.474
MAN OR WOMAN?
IT'S A COMPUTER.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.343
...IS UNAVAILABLE.

02:55.376 --> 02:56.977
UH...
 ( beep )

02:57.010 --> 02:59.613
GIVE IT TO ME. JUST...!

03:01.349 --> 03:04.318
HI, UM... THIS IS
A FRIEND OF VIVIAN'S.

03:04.352 --> 03:06.654
CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME
A CALL BACK ON THIS
NUMBER TODAY?

03:06.687 --> 03:08.756
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.
THANKS.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.661
I KNOW THAT TEENAGERS
 MAKE MISTAKES.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.529
IT'S THEIR BIOLOGICAL
MANDATE TO SCREW UP.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.298
THIS WAS NO MISTAKE!
THIS WAS INTENTIONAL!

03:17.331 --> 03:19.433
SHE SET OUT TO
SABOTAGE MY DAUGHTER

03:19.467 --> 03:20.801
IN HER FIRST
WEEK OF SCHOOL.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.703
HANNA SAID SHE DIDN'T DO IT,
AND I BELIEVE HER.

03:22.736 --> 03:23.971
OH, REALLY?
THEN WHO DID?

03:24.004 --> 03:25.739
IT WAS SENT
FROM HER PHONE!

03:25.773 --> 03:28.242
HANNA'S RESUME
SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.

03:28.276 --> 03:30.378
SHE IS MALICIOUS,
SHE IS RESENTFUL,

03:30.411 --> 03:31.645
AND I WANT TO SEE HER
PUNISHED FOR THIS.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.347
AND SHE WILL BE.

03:33.381 --> 03:36.350
ROSEWOOD HIGH HAS A ZERO
TOLERANCE POLICY FOR BULLYING,

03:36.384 --> 03:39.453
AND SENDING A PHOTO LIKE THIS
IS A VERY SERIOUS OFFENSE.

03:39.487 --> 03:41.355
SHE WILL NOT BE
LET OFF THE HOOK.

03:41.389 --> 03:42.623
SHE'S BEEN OFF THE HOOK
FOR SOME TIME.

03:42.656 --> 03:43.891
THERE'S NO GUIDANCE.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.659
HER MOTHER IS NEVER HOME.

03:45.693 --> 03:48.629
HER MOTHER IS A DIVORCED
WOMAN WHO WORKS FULL TIME

03:48.662 --> 03:50.964
BECAUSE HER HUSBAND
LEFT HER FOR YOU!

03:50.998 --> 03:52.833
LADIES, LADIES, LOOK.

03:52.866 --> 03:56.304
UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES,
SHE WOULD BE EXPELLED FOR THIS.

03:56.337 --> 03:59.607
HOWEVER, GIVEN THE UNUSUAL
CIRCUMSTANCES HERE,

03:59.640 --> 04:01.975
I THINK EVERYONE HERE
WOULD BE BETTER SERVED
BY A DIFFERENT APPROACH.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.844
BEING EXPELLED WORKS FOR ME.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.613
WHAT WERE YOU
GOING TO SUGGEST,
MR. TAMBORELLI?

04:05.646 --> 04:07.047
UNTIL THE SCHOOL BOARD
FIGURES OUT

04:07.080 --> 04:08.782
HOW THEY'RE GONNA HANDLE THIS,

04:08.816 --> 04:10.584
I WANT YOU LADIES
TO WORK THROUGH IT.

04:10.618 --> 04:11.952
SO IN TOMORROW'S EVENT,

04:11.985 --> 04:13.454
YOU'RE GONNA BE PUT
IN THE SAME GROUP.

04:13.487 --> 04:14.822
WHAT EVENT?
WHAT IS THIS?

04:14.855 --> 04:18.591
OUR SCHOOL SPONSORS
"TRUTH UP" DAY.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.528
IT'S A GUIDED WORKSHOP.

04:20.560 --> 04:21.795
THE GOAL IS
TO BREAK BARRIERS,

04:21.829 --> 04:23.063
FORGE NEW CONNECTIONS,

04:23.096 --> 04:24.832
AND OWN UP TO BAD BEHAVIOR.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.335
EVERYONE WHO PARTICIPATES
STAYS OVERNIGHT.

04:27.368 --> 04:28.602
AND THIS IS
SUPERVISED BY...?

04:28.636 --> 04:30.604
TEACHERS AND PARENTS.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.005
WOULD EITHER OF YOU
CARE TO VOLUNTEER?

04:32.039 --> 04:33.474
I'LL BE THERE.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.075
GOOD.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.611
WELL, YOU'LL BE EXPECTED
TO BRING A SLEEPING BAG,

04:37.645 --> 04:40.814
A TOOTHBRUSH,
AND A CHANGE IN ATTITUDE.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.586
* GOT A SECRET

04:45.619 --> 04:47.020
* CAN YOU KEEP IT?

04:47.054 --> 04:49.022
* SWEAR THIS ONE YOU'LL SAVE

04:49.056 --> 04:50.858
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

04:50.891 --> 04:53.994
* TAKING THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

04:54.027 --> 04:56.397
* IF I SHOW YOU
 THEN I KNOW YOU *

04:56.430 --> 04:58.832
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

04:58.866 --> 05:01.101
* 'CAUSE TWO
 CAN KEEP A SECRET *

05:01.134 --> 05:03.937
* IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD

05:07.741 --> 05:10.811
WAIT. THEY STILL THINK
YOU SENT THAT PICTURE?

05:10.844 --> 05:13.080
YEP.
AT LEAST YOU WEREN'T
SUSPENDED, HAN.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.548
THIS IS GONNA BLOW OVER.

05:14.582 --> 05:16.083
YEAH, UNTIL "A"
GETS HUNGRY AGAIN

05:16.116 --> 05:18.852
AND TAKES ANOTHER BITE
OUT OF MY ASS.

05:18.886 --> 05:19.987
HANNA.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.422
NO. WE THOUGHT
WE HAD ALL THE POWER

05:21.455 --> 05:23.023
BECAUSE
WE HAD "A's" PHONE.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.092
WELL, GUESS WHAT--
NOW "A's" USING

05:25.125 --> 05:26.594
OUR PHONES AGAINST US.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.085
GUESS IT COULD HAVE BEEN
A LOT WORSE, RIGHT?

05:52.119 --> 05:53.587
TAMBORELLI'S A JERK.

05:53.621 --> 05:55.989
HIT THE WALL
WITH HIM LAST WEEK.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.958
WAIT, IS HE THE ONE WHO'S
KEEPING YOU OFF THE SWIM TEAM?

05:57.991 --> 06:00.728
TOTALLY. HE'S GOT
SOME MAJOR SPONSOR
ON THE HOOK

06:00.761 --> 06:02.095
AND DOESN'T WANT
ANYONE IN THE POOL

06:02.129 --> 06:03.997
WHO MIGHT TARNISH
THE TEAM'S IMAGE.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.600
WHAT?! GOD,
TALK ABOUT BULLIES!

06:06.634 --> 06:09.002
HOW MUCH LONGER ARE WE
GONNA HAVE TO PAY

06:09.036 --> 06:11.371
FOR PICKING UP
THAT STUPID SHOVEL?

06:22.550 --> 06:23.784
HEY.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.919
HEY.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.187
WHAT'S EVERYBODY DOING?

06:27.220 --> 06:30.524
UH, SOME KIND OF PROJECT
FOR "TRUTH UP" DAY.

06:30.558 --> 06:31.825
WANNA HELP?

06:31.859 --> 06:33.026
SURE.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.064
SO, HOW'S THAT BRUISE DOING?

06:37.097 --> 06:38.699
FINE.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.134
HELP ME WITH THIS,
WOULD YOU?

06:41.168 --> 06:45.673
UM... IT ONLY WORKS
IF YOU PULL ON THE END.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.144
IT'S NOT REALLY FAIR,
YOU KNOW.

06:51.178 --> 06:54.081
I AGREE. NEXT THEY'LL BE
ASKING US TO PAINT THE SCHOOL.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.549
I'M TALKING ABOUT
OUR ARRANGEMENT.

06:55.583 --> 06:56.950
HOW COME YOU GET TO KNOW
WHO I'M MEETING,

06:56.984 --> 06:58.552
BUT I DON'T GET TO KNOW
WHO YOU'RE MEETING?

06:58.586 --> 06:59.853
BECAUSE THAT'S
OUR ARRANGEMENT.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.054
YOU KNOW ENOUGH.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.860
OKAY.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.003
I'LL GO GET SOME THUMBTACKS.

07:33.587 --> 07:34.755
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

07:38.025 --> 07:40.928
( Jenna laughing )

07:46.600 --> 07:47.701
SPENCER?

07:47.735 --> 07:50.604
HEY.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.272
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

07:52.305 --> 07:54.141
JUST HAD TO DROP OFF
SOME OLD FORMS--

07:54.174 --> 07:56.510
KIDS THAT I COUNSELED
AFTER SCHOOL.

07:56.544 --> 07:57.778
WERE YOU OUT OF TOWN?

07:57.811 --> 07:59.747
YEAH, YEAH. GEORGIA.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.849
WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FIX UP
MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.517
IT NEEDS A LITTLE WORK.

08:03.551 --> 08:05.719
HEY, CAN YOU, UH,
DO ME A FAVOR?

08:05.753 --> 08:07.955
UM, WHAT DO YOU NEED?

08:07.988 --> 08:09.289
GIVE YOUR FATHER
A MESSAGE FOR ME.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.191
TELL HIM HE OWES ME A CALL.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.126
WHY?
JUST GIVE HIM THE MESSAGE.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.195
I'M BACK, AND HE CAN'T
KEEP DODGING ME.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.930
JASON!

08:16.964 --> 08:19.633
HEY, JASON,
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.535
THAT'S OKAY. WE WERE DONE.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.604
HOW YOU DOING, ELLA?
FRAZZLED.

08:23.637 --> 08:26.540
I VOLUNTEERED TO
RECRUIT SUPERVISORS
FOR TOMORROW'S EVENT,

08:26.574 --> 08:28.075
AND I AM STILL SHORT ON STAFF.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.843
ARE YOU BY ANY CHANCE FREE?

08:29.877 --> 08:30.911
I DON'T THINK SO.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.546
WELL, IT WAS WORTH A TRY.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.246
PLEASE TELL ME YOUR PARENTS
ARE STILL ONBOARD,

08:34.280 --> 08:36.216
BECAUSE I NEED BODIES.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.951
YEAH, I'M PRETTY SURE.

08:37.985 --> 08:39.687
WHAT'S THE EVENT?

08:39.720 --> 08:42.188
MAYBE, UH...
MAYBE I CAN BE THERE.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.758
REALLY?
WELL, YEAH. I MEAN...

08:44.792 --> 08:46.159
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE
DESPERATE ENOUGH TO ASK ME,

08:46.193 --> 08:47.628
THEN, SURE, COUNT ME IN.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.863
( soft chuckle )

08:51.899 --> 08:53.033
( knock on door )
COME IN.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.269
DOING YOUR HOMEWORK?

08:56.303 --> 08:57.971
YEAH. WHAT'S UP?

08:58.005 --> 08:59.973
I WAS JUST READING
SOME MATERIAL ON
THIS "TRUTH UP" DAY.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.775
FIGURE IF I'M GOING
TO SUPERVISE, I...

09:01.809 --> 09:03.977
YOU REALLY
DON'T HAVE TO GO.
I MEAN, IT SOUNDS PATHETIC.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.813
NO, I WANT TO GO.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.581
I NEED SOME ANSWERS MYSELF.

09:12.119 --> 09:16.356
HANNA, I DON'T CARE
WHAT IT SAYS ON YOUR
DRIVER'S LICENSE.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.326
TO ME, YOU ARE STILL
MY BABY GIRL,

09:19.359 --> 09:22.963
AND... I WILL CRUSH
ANYONE WHO TRIES
TO HURT YOU.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.598
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

09:25.799 --> 09:27.968
MAYBE I'VE MADE
SOME MISTAKES,

09:28.001 --> 09:29.770
CLEANING UP YOUR MESSES...

09:29.803 --> 09:32.005
MOM.
...NOT FORCING YOU TO TALK

09:32.039 --> 09:33.707
BECAUSE I WANTED
TO RESPECT YOUR PRIVACY.

09:33.741 --> 09:36.176
STOP.

09:36.209 --> 09:37.678
WE DON'T HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.112
YES, WE DO.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.848
THIS IS NOT
THE FIRST TIME

09:40.881 --> 09:43.951
YOU'VE TOLD ME
SOMEONE FRAMED YOU.

09:43.984 --> 09:46.754
WHO WOULD DO THAT?

09:46.787 --> 09:48.288
WHY CAN'T YOU
GIVE ME A NAME?

09:48.321 --> 09:50.123
THERE IS NO NAME.

09:54.862 --> 09:58.666
HANNA, YOU CAME VERY CLOSE
TO GETTING KICKED OUT OF
SCHOOL THIS MORNING.

09:58.699 --> 10:02.002
THIS IS POTENTIALLY
A CRIMINAL CHARGE.

10:02.035 --> 10:06.273
WHO DO YOU THINK
SENT THAT PICTURE
FROM YOUR PHONE?

10:08.408 --> 10:11.078
LOOK, I'M STUCK HERE.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.981
I'VE GIVEN YOU
EVERY OPPORTUNITY
TO CONFIDE IN ME.

10:14.014 --> 10:16.416
I'M JUST GONNA ASK YOU,
DID YOU...

10:16.449 --> 10:18.251
SEND THAT PICTURE OUT?

10:30.197 --> 10:31.398
I DIDN'T DO IT.

10:50.417 --> 10:51.785
OFF.

10:54.154 --> 10:57.257
YOU GUYS, TAMBORELLI'S
TELLING KIDS TO TURN OFF
THEIR CELL PHONES.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.126
OTHERWISE, HE'S GONNA
HAVE TO CONFISCATE THEM.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.293
THEY CAN'T DO THAT,
CAN THEY?

11:00.327 --> 11:01.995
THOSE ARE THE RULES.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.363
TURN OFF
THE DIGITAL SPIGOT,
OR THEY WILL.

11:03.396 --> 11:04.832
WAIT, WHAT'S A SPIGOT?

11:04.865 --> 11:06.233
IT'S--

11:06.266 --> 11:08.401
NEVER MIND.
I REALLY DON'T CARE.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.771
ARE THERE ANY MESSAGES
FROM THAT NUMBER IN
ALI'S COAT?

11:10.804 --> 11:12.039
NO.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.941
PEOPLE, PLEASE,
PICK A LINE.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.776
ANY LINE.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.144
AND IT DOES NOT
MATTER WHICH ONE.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.912
YOU WILL BE GIVEN
YOUR GROUP ASSIGNMENTS,

11:18.946 --> 11:20.247
AND THEY WILL TELL YOU
WHERE TO GO,

11:20.280 --> 11:22.115
BUT, PLEASE,
JUST PICK A LINE.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.890
WHAT'S UP?

11:30.991 --> 11:32.325
HEY. NOTHING.

11:34.995 --> 11:37.330
MUST BE WEIRD
TO HAVE YOUR MOM HERE.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.199
IF SHE PATROLS THE HALLS
AT SCHOOL AND AT HOME,

11:39.232 --> 11:41.434
I CAN SEE WHY
YOU NEED TO SNEAK OUT
NOW AND THEN.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.306
HEY. WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR VOICE?

11:48.341 --> 11:51.278
DOES THIS HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH WHAT FELL OUT
OF MY BAG YESTERDAY?

11:53.947 --> 11:55.749
DID YOU TELL YOUR MOTHER?

11:55.783 --> 11:57.284
NO.

11:57.317 --> 12:00.020
NO, I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.755
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
I'M OKAY WITH IT, THOUGH.

12:01.789 --> 12:02.990
OKAY WITH WHAT?

12:03.023 --> 12:05.358
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
SAY IT OUT LOUD.

12:07.961 --> 12:11.198
HOLDEN, IF YOU ARE
HOOKED ON SOMETHING,
OR IF YOU'RE DEALING--

12:11.231 --> 12:13.066
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.334
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

12:14.367 --> 12:16.804
NO.

12:16.837 --> 12:19.072
THAT BAG WASN'T FILLED WITH
FLINTSTONES VITAMINS.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.373
I'M NOT STUPID.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.209
NO, BUT YOU'RE WAY OFF.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.077
WE'VE SET UP
ANOTHER TABLE.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.879
START A LINE
OVER THERE.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.574
HEY, DID YOU KNOW SHE WAS
GONNA BE IN THIS GROUP?

12:54.607 --> 12:56.509
NO.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.545
IF I DID, I WOULD HAVE
GIVEN MYSELF A FEVER
THIS MORNING.

12:58.578 --> 12:59.913
( Caleb chuckles )

13:01.949 --> 13:03.450
EXCUSE ME, WHERE'S 206?

13:03.483 --> 13:04.918
RIGHT THERE.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.119
OH.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.994
JASON.
NICE TO SEE YOU.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.897
ARE YOU PART OF THIS?
YEAH, THIS IS MY GROUP.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.266
I'M HELPING OUT FOR THE DAY.
IS PETER HERE TOO?

13:19.299 --> 13:20.868
NO, MR. HASTINGS
IS OUT OF TOWN.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.602
OF COURSE HE IS.

13:22.635 --> 13:23.937
I'M SORRY?

13:23.971 --> 13:26.373
NOTHING.
UH... AFTER YOU.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.284
YOU'VE GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.986
WHAT, YOU KNOW THAT GUY?

13:39.019 --> 13:41.188
YEAH. IT'S ALISON'S BROTHER.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.561
( sighs )
I CAN'T DO THIS.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.130
I DON'T THINK
YOU'VE GOT A CHOICE.

13:51.932 --> 13:54.567
BESIDES, WITH EVERYBODY
SPILLING THEIR GUTS TODAY,

13:54.601 --> 13:57.570
SOME OF US MIGHT HAVE
A LOT TO SAY.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.039
I KNOW I DO.

14:03.276 --> 14:04.945
OKAY.

14:04.978 --> 14:08.081
TAKE A STEP FORWARD
IF YOU'D RATHER NOT BE HERE.

14:08.115 --> 14:11.451
HOW ABOUT WE SKIP THIS STEP
AND JUST JUMP OUT THE WINDOW?

14:11.484 --> 14:13.286
( subdued laughter )

14:13.320 --> 14:15.388
LET'S START WITH A STEP

14:15.422 --> 14:17.424
'CAUSE I'M SURE SOME OF YOU
WOULD RATHER NOT BE HERE.

14:21.494 --> 14:24.898
OKAY. TAKE A STEP IF YOU FEEL
YOU'VE EVER BEEN MISTREATED

14:24.932 --> 14:29.002
BY A STUDENT OF A FACULTY
MEMBER OF THIS SCHOOL.

14:33.974 --> 14:36.876
UM, EMILY,
ONE STEP AT A TIME.

14:41.648 --> 14:44.117
TAKE A STEP IF YOU'VE
EVER FELT THE SCHOOL

14:44.151 --> 14:47.587
WAS AN UNSAFE
OR UNWELCOMING ENVIRONMENT.

14:52.059 --> 14:54.094
EMILY.
ONE STEP IS NOT ENOUGH.

14:54.127 --> 14:57.030
IT'S NOT SAFE OR WELCOMING.

14:57.064 --> 14:59.366
FOR SOME OF US,
IT GETS WORSE EVERY DAY.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.134
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

15:01.168 --> 15:03.503
I USED TO
ENJOY GOING TO SCHOOL,

15:03.536 --> 15:05.505
BEING A PART OF A TEAM
AND ALL THAT.

15:05.538 --> 15:08.508
BUT NOW YOU MAKE ONE
MISTAKE AND YOU'RE TARNISHED,

15:08.541 --> 15:10.410
NEVER TO BE TRUSTED AGAIN.

15:10.443 --> 15:13.080
EMILY, CAN I SEE YOU
FOR A MOMENT?

15:17.117 --> 15:18.551
OKAY, UH, TAKE A STEP

15:18.585 --> 15:20.453
IF YOU'VE EVER LIED
TO YOUR PARENTS

15:20.487 --> 15:22.555
ABOUT DRINKING ALCOHOL.

15:25.025 --> 15:27.995
IF YOU'RE FEELING
UNSAFE AND UNWELCOME,

15:28.028 --> 15:30.530
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
YOUR BEHAVIOR HAS
MADE YOUR TEAMMATES

15:30.563 --> 15:33.133
AND OTHER STUDENTS
AT THIS SCHOOL
FEEL THE SAME WAY.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.535
NOW, YOU'RE NOT HELPING
YOUR CAUSE BY ATTACKING ME.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.137
I WASN'T ATTACK--

15:37.170 --> 15:39.039
YOU'RE NO SAINT, EMILY.

15:39.072 --> 15:42.542
MAYBE IT'S TIME YOU TAKE
A LOOK AT WHAT GOT YOU
TO THIS POINT.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.211
...many of you are afraid
to talk about things

15:44.244 --> 15:45.512
that could bond you
to strangers.

15:45.545 --> 15:48.315
This exercise
is about discovery...

15:48.348 --> 15:51.518
DISCOVERING YOURSELF
AND DISCOVERING YOUR CLASSMATES.

15:51.551 --> 15:54.321
( cellphone rings )

15:56.089 --> 15:59.126
SORRY. FORGOT
TO TURN IT OFF.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.991
I WANT TO GO BACK
TO MY OLD SCHOOL.

16:35.528 --> 16:38.731
UH, HOT TUBS
IN THE COURTYARD.
( laughter )

16:38.765 --> 16:41.201
HALF DAY ON FRIDAYS
AND NO TRIG.
( laughter )

16:41.234 --> 16:42.569
YEAH. OKAY.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.304
LET'S USE THIS GAME
TO TALK ABOUT

16:44.337 --> 16:46.506
WHAT WE COULD
REASONABLY CHANGE.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.808
A HOT TUB IN THE COURTYARD
DOES NOT COUNT.

16:48.841 --> 16:53.813
NOW, KATE, YOU MENTIONED
LIKING YOUR OLD SCHOOL.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.416
WHAT DO THEY HAVE
THAT WE DON'T?

16:57.550 --> 16:59.652
NICE PEOPLE.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.521
YES, WELL, WE HAVE
SOME OF THOSE HERE,

17:01.554 --> 17:02.822
AND I AM SURE
YOU WILL FIND THEM.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.491
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE?

17:06.159 --> 17:08.761
I THINK STUDENTS SHOULD
HAVE MORE OF A SAY.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.497
IF SOMEONE'S MESSED WITH YOU,

17:10.530 --> 17:12.832
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE
TO DECIDE THEIR PUNISHMENT.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.300
HEY, NOW.
NO.

17:14.334 --> 17:15.367
( chuckles )
WHAT?

17:15.402 --> 17:16.569
TOSS ME THE BALL.

17:18.671 --> 17:21.074
I'M JUST SAYING,
IF SOMEBODY PULLED
THAT KIND OF STUNT

17:21.108 --> 17:23.076
ON ME AT A NEW SCHOOL,
I'D GO POSTAL.

17:23.109 --> 17:24.711
ON THE OTHER HAND...

17:24.743 --> 17:27.314
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D RENT A BILLBOARD.
( subdued snickers )

17:27.347 --> 17:29.249
NOEL, LET'S DROP
THE BAD BOY ACT

17:29.282 --> 17:30.517
AND JUST GET REAL.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.086
BAD BOYS GOT NOTHING
ON MEAN GIRLS.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.188
GUYS HAVE A FIGHT,
THERE'S A PUNCH,
IT'S OVER.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.257
GIRLS DON'T FIGHT FAIR.

17:37.290 --> 17:40.193
THEY GANG UP,
THEY KEEP SECRETS,
THEY PLOT.

17:40.227 --> 17:41.828
THEY CAN CUT YOU DOWN
WITH A LOOK.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.263
YOU KNOW WHAT?
GIVE ME THE BALL.

17:43.296 --> 17:44.331
HANNA!

17:44.364 --> 17:45.865
NO, IT'S MY TURN.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.800
WHERE DOES HE GET OFF
CALLING OTHER PEOPLE OUT?

17:47.834 --> 17:50.437
HE IS THE WORST, SMUG,
BLACKMAILING SON OF A--?

17:50.470 --> 17:51.438
HANNA!

17:51.471 --> 17:52.839
MISS MONTGOMERY,

17:52.872 --> 17:54.674
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN ME?

17:54.707 --> 17:57.610
DO YOU THINK I'M
THE PERSON HE'S DESCRIBING?

17:57.644 --> 17:59.579
AM I A BULLY?

18:03.650 --> 18:05.418
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T ANSWER THAT

18:05.452 --> 18:07.420
BECAUSE I ALREADY KNOW WHAT
EVERYONE HERE THINKS OF ME.

18:24.237 --> 18:26.539
HOW WAS BREAK?
DID YOU SEE HANNA?

18:26.573 --> 18:29.576
HOW'S SHE DOING?

18:29.609 --> 18:32.345
OKAY, I GUESS.

18:32.379 --> 18:34.214
I MEAN, IT'S HARD.

18:34.247 --> 18:36.783
PEOPLE REALLY THINK
SHE SENT THAT PICTURE.

18:36.816 --> 18:37.784
PEOPLE ARE TOADS.

18:41.688 --> 18:45.225
MONA, I KNOW YOU HEARD
WHAT TAMBORELLI SAID TO ME,

18:45.258 --> 18:46.893
AND I'M NOT PROUD
OF THE STUFF THAT WENT DOWN

18:46.926 --> 18:48.728
WHEN ALISON WAS STILL HERE.

18:50.230 --> 18:53.933
SHE TREATED YOU BADLY,
AND I...

18:53.966 --> 18:56.436
I LET HER.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.704
I NEVER TRIED TO STOP HER,

18:57.737 --> 18:59.272
AND I SHOULD HAVE.

19:03.243 --> 19:04.411
I'M SORRY.

19:08.215 --> 19:09.682
( scoffs )
OH, HONEY.

19:09.716 --> 19:12.652
THAT WAS, LIKE,
TWO PERSONALITIES AGO.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.454
I AM SO NOT HOLDING
ON TO THAT.

19:14.487 --> 19:15.788
WHAT GETS ME

19:15.822 --> 19:18.625
IS HOW TAMBORELLI
IS TREATING YOU.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.693
HE'S TOAD OF TOAD HALL.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.229
I MEAN, IF YOU WERE A GUY,

19:22.262 --> 19:23.963
YOU'D ALREADY BE
BACK ON THE SHARKS.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.532
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:25.565 --> 19:27.500
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH SLACK HE CUTS

19:27.534 --> 19:29.636
FOR THE FOOTBALL TEAM?

19:29.669 --> 19:31.771
"OFFENSIVE LINE"
DOESN'T BEGIN TO DESCRIBE

19:31.804 --> 19:33.273
WHAT THEY GET AWAY WITH.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.807
HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS?

19:34.841 --> 19:36.843
I USED TO WORK
IN THE V.P.'s OFFICE
DURING HOME ROOM.

19:36.876 --> 19:39.279
I KNOW A LOT...

19:39.312 --> 19:40.713
AND YOU SHOULD TOO.

19:40.747 --> 19:43.750
OKAY, EVERYONE,
BREAK'S OVER.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.622
FEEL FREE TO WRITE DOWN
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.824
IT'S ANONYMOUS.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.293
JENNA, IF YOU
NEED HELP, I CAN--

19:53.326 --> 19:54.527
NO, THANK YOU.
I'LL PASS.

19:54.561 --> 19:55.862
WELL, I'M SORRY,

19:55.895 --> 19:57.497
BUT THAT'S NOT
REALLY AN OPTION.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.798
IF YOU'D PREFER JASON,
HE'LL BE BACK

19:58.831 --> 20:00.367
IN A FEW MINUTES
WITH THE FLASHLIGHTS,

20:00.400 --> 20:01.568
OR IF THERE'S
SOMEONE ELSE YOU TRUST.

20:01.601 --> 20:02.902
I DON'T TRUST
ANYONE AROUND HERE.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.372
OKAY.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.607
WELL, KEEP IN MIND
THAT THIS DAY IS ABOUT

20:07.640 --> 20:09.609
OPENING UP
TO NEW POSSIBILITIES,

20:09.642 --> 20:11.478
AND YOU'LL
BE EXPECTED TO--

20:11.511 --> 20:13.780
TO WHAT? TO FORGIVE
ALL THE CLASSMATES
WHO'VE MISTREATED ME?

20:13.813 --> 20:15.382
( mirthless chuckle )

20:15.415 --> 20:17.750
I'M NOT BIG ON GROUP
HUGS, MRS. HASTINGS.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.486
I DON'T NEED
A SPECIAL FLASHLIGHT

20:19.519 --> 20:21.254
TO KNOW WHAT PEOPLE
AROUND HERE ARE HIDING.

20:21.288 --> 20:25.925
THIS SCHOOL'S FILLED
WITH PHONIES AND LIARS.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.660
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.

20:28.961 --> 20:30.597
IN WHAT WAY HAVE YOU
BEEN MISTREATED?

20:30.630 --> 20:31.864
HOW MUCH TIME HAVE YOU GOT?

20:31.898 --> 20:33.866
OH, SHOULD I-- SHOULD I
START WITH THE DAY

20:33.900 --> 20:36.536
THAT I WAS CORNERED
IN THE GIRLS' BATHROOM
AND SMACKED?

20:36.569 --> 20:37.837
Is she talking about Hanna?

20:37.870 --> 20:39.572
DID YOU EVER REPORT THIS?

20:39.606 --> 20:41.708
WELL, SHE COULDN'T.
Wait! Caleb!

20:41.741 --> 20:43.843
NO BECAUSE IF SHE HAD,
SHE WOULD HAVE TO ADMIT

20:43.876 --> 20:45.678
THAT SHE
THREW THE FIRST PUNCH.

20:47.414 --> 20:49.048
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, JENNA?

20:49.081 --> 20:52.452
SO, JUST TO CLARIFY,
WE ARE TELLING THE WHOLE
TRUTH TODAY, RIGHT,

20:52.485 --> 20:54.421
NOT JUST THE PART
WE WANT TO REMEMBER?

20:56.356 --> 20:59.759
BY THE WAY,
THIS IS CALEB SPEAKING,

20:59.792 --> 21:01.428
IN CASE YOU WERE CONFUSED.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.538
JASON!

21:11.571 --> 21:15.508
I HEARD THAT YOU AND MY MOM
ARE LEADING A GROUP.

21:15.542 --> 21:16.943
HOW WEIRD IS THAT?

21:16.976 --> 21:19.546
YEAH, IT IS.

21:19.579 --> 21:20.913
I WAS HOPING IT WOULD
BE YOUR DAD, THOUGH.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.515
WHY?

21:22.549 --> 21:24.651
WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT
THAT YOU TALK TO HIM?

21:24.684 --> 21:26.052
( soft chuckle )

21:26.085 --> 21:27.787
JASON, LOOK,
I KNOW ABOUT THE WILL.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.824
I KNOW THAT
MY DAD RISKED A LOT
TO PROTECT YOU,

21:31.858 --> 21:33.760
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.763
WAS THERE SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENED BETWEEN
OUR FAMILIES?

21:36.796 --> 21:39.666
JUST TALK TO YOUR DAD
WHEN HE GETS BACK IN TOWN.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.868
HE'S NOT OUT OF TOWN,
AND I'VE ALREADY ASKED HIM.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.703
HE WON'T TELL ME.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.343
CALEB WENT AFTER HER?

21:50.377 --> 21:51.744
WHAT DID JENNA DO?

21:51.778 --> 21:53.480
NOTHING YET.

21:53.513 --> 21:55.348
CALEB THINKS HE KNOWS
WHO HE'S DEALING WITH,

21:55.382 --> 21:57.484
AND IF HANNA WAS
WORRIED ABOUT HIM BEFORE...

21:57.517 --> 21:58.918
WHERE IS HANNA?

21:58.951 --> 22:00.953
I DON'T KNOW.
NO ONE CALLED BACK.

22:00.987 --> 22:02.389
WHAT?

22:05.157 --> 22:06.893
THE NUMBER FROM ALI'S COAT.

22:09.462 --> 22:11.931
WELL, WE SHOULD HAVE
SAID WE WERE VIVIAN,
NOT HER FRIEND.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.666
THAT MESSAGE WOULD
HAVE BEEN RETURNED.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.635
CALL BACK.
SAY YOU'RE VIVIAN.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.370
WELL, I CAN'T DO IT.
HE KNOWS MY VOICE.
YOU DO IT.

22:17.404 --> 22:19.472
ME? I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT A VIVIAN SOUNDS LIKE.

22:19.506 --> 22:21.107
A LOT LIKE ALISON.

22:21.140 --> 22:22.875
YOU KNOW WHAT?
GIVE IT TO ME.
I'LL DO IT.

22:25.512 --> 22:27.880
( dialing cellphone )

22:27.914 --> 22:30.850
( telephone ringing )

22:30.883 --> 22:32.051
Girl: HELLO?

22:34.487 --> 22:35.722
HELLO?

22:35.755 --> 22:39.125
UH, HI. HI. UM...

22:40.493 --> 22:42.028
I-I LEFT A MESSAGE
YESTERDAY.

22:42.061 --> 22:43.896
I'M A FRIEND OF VIVIAN'S.

22:43.930 --> 22:47.033
YEAH. WHO GAVE YOU
 THIS NUMBER?

22:47.066 --> 22:49.769
NO ONE HERE KNOWS
 ANYONE NAMED VIVIAN.

22:49.802 --> 22:51.037
DON'T CALL HERE AGAIN.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.772
( dial tone )

22:52.805 --> 22:55.408
OH, SHE TOTALLY
GOT OUR MESSAGE.

22:55.442 --> 22:57.176
OR SHE'S JUST TIRED
OF A STRANGER

22:57.209 --> 22:59.045
CLOGGING UP
HER VOICE MAIL.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.813
YEAH. MAYBE IT IS
WHAT IT IS--

23:00.847 --> 23:02.549
JUST A NUMBER IN A POCKET.

23:02.582 --> 23:04.083
Woman on P.A.:
 ATTENTION, PLEASE.

23:04.116 --> 23:06.419
WILL EMILY FIELDS
 PLEASE REPORT IMMEDIATELY

23:06.453 --> 23:08.154
TO THE VICE PRINCIPAL'S
 OFFICE?

23:08.187 --> 23:09.989
WHAT'S GOING ON?

23:10.022 --> 23:11.558
LONG STORY.

23:11.591 --> 23:13.159
CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER.

23:19.031 --> 23:21.568
MONTGOMERY.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.570
BET YOUR GRUB'S
BETTER THAN MINE.

23:23.603 --> 23:24.971
( chuckling )
HEY.

23:25.004 --> 23:26.539
YOU WANNA FIND SOMEPLACE
TO SIT AND EAT?

23:26.573 --> 23:28.741
OH, UM... AC-ACTUALLY,

23:28.775 --> 23:30.910
I WAS JUST GONNA GO
MEET SOME FRIENDS.

23:30.943 --> 23:33.880
OH. OKAY.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.884
HEY, ARE WE STILL ON
FOR SATURDAY?

23:37.917 --> 23:39.686
I WAS KIND OF
COUNTING ON IT.

23:39.719 --> 23:42.789
( sighs )
LOOK, HOLDEN--

23:42.822 --> 23:44.924
I'M JUST-- I'M STARTING
TO FEEL REALLY WEIRD

23:44.957 --> 23:47.059
ABOUT COVERING FOR
WHATEVER IT IS THAT
YOU'RE DOING.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.161
ARIA.
NO, I-I LIKE YOUR PARENTS...

23:49.195 --> 23:51.063
AND I LIKE YOU. A LOT. I DO.

23:51.097 --> 23:55.067
BUT... I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN HANDLE IT

23:55.101 --> 23:57.036
IF YOU'RE HURTING YOURSELF.

23:57.069 --> 24:00.573
SO... WHAT,
THE DEAL'S OVER?

24:00.607 --> 24:02.609
DON'T YOU NEED ME?
WHO'S GONNA COVER FOR YOU?

24:04.143 --> 24:06.245
I DON'T KNOW. I...
HAVEN'T FIGURED THAT OUT YET,

24:06.278 --> 24:07.680
BUT... I WILL.

24:09.015 --> 24:10.650
I'M SORRY.

24:10.683 --> 24:12.952
Female Vocalist:
 * ...COULD TELL YOU WHY

24:15.788 --> 24:17.857
* THOUGHT I COULD
 ALMOST SEE *

24:17.890 --> 24:19.659
* THE OTHER SIDE

24:21.060 --> 24:22.495
* OF SOMETHING

24:22.529 --> 24:23.763
COME ON, YOU HAVE
TO EAT SOMETHING.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.031
* REAL

24:25.064 --> 24:27.700
MY MOM THINKS I SENT
THAT PICTURE TOO.

24:27.734 --> 24:29.702
NO, SHE DOESN'T.
ONLY FOUR PEOPLE...

24:29.736 --> 24:31.738
IN THIS WHOLE TOWN
WHO DON'T THINK
I LIVE IN THE SEWER.

24:31.771 --> 24:35.141
I TRIED THAT.
BELIEVE ME, THE ROOF
IS MUCH BETTER.

24:35.174 --> 24:37.610
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
GO TO CALIFORNIA.

24:37.644 --> 24:39.011
THEY HAVE HIGH SCHOOLS THERE.

24:39.045 --> 24:41.914
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO CALIFORNIA.

24:41.948 --> 24:43.115
GIVE ME YOUR CELLPHONE.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.551
( thud )
I CAN TRACE
AN I.P. ADDRESS.

24:44.584 --> 24:46.519
WHAT WAS THAT?

24:49.789 --> 24:51.257
JUST THE PLASTIC.

24:51.290 --> 24:52.792
ARE YOU SURE WE'RE
THE ONLY ONES UP HERE?

24:52.825 --> 24:55.962
I'M POSITIVE.
NOBODY COMES UP HERE.

24:55.995 --> 24:57.830
I FOUND IT WHEN I WAS
SQUATTING IN THE SCHOOL.

24:57.864 --> 24:59.966
THIS WAS, LIKE, MY PATIO.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.734
* THOUGHT I COULD
 ALMOST SEE... *

25:01.768 --> 25:03.235
WHERE'S YOUR CELL PHONE?

25:03.269 --> 25:04.971
* ...THE OTHER SIDE

25:05.004 --> 25:06.873
JUST... LET ME HELP YOU.
JUST HOLD ME.

25:06.906 --> 25:08.875
OKAY?

25:08.908 --> 25:10.877
THAT WILL HELP ME.

25:10.910 --> 25:12.612
* I WANTED TO FEEL

25:12.645 --> 25:14.013
* LIKE I

25:14.046 --> 25:15.548
* COULD TELL YOU WHY

25:18.651 --> 25:20.887
* THOUGHT I COULD
 ALMOST SEE *

25:20.920 --> 25:22.822
* THE OTHER SIDE

25:24.090 --> 25:26.292
* THE END IS HERE

25:33.700 --> 25:35.301
( knocking on door )

25:37.369 --> 25:39.138
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

25:39.171 --> 25:41.073
GOTTA GET YOU BACK
IN THAT POOL, EM.
YOU'RE OUT OF SHAPE.

25:41.107 --> 25:43.576
MONA, HOW DID YOU
GET IN HERE?

25:43.610 --> 25:45.578
AND WHERE'S MR. TAMBORELLI?

25:45.612 --> 25:47.847
PROBABLY ON HIS SECOND
BEER AT THE SMOKEHOUSE.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.248
I SAW HIM SNEAK OUT.

25:49.281 --> 25:50.750
SHUT THE BLINDS,
WOULD YOU?

25:51.951 --> 25:55.054
WAS THAT YOU
WHO CALLED ME DOWN HERE?

25:55.087 --> 25:56.889
I DIDN'T
RECOGNIZE YOUR VOICE.

25:56.923 --> 25:59.592
YES, I KNOW.
IT'S A GIFT.

25:59.626 --> 26:01.327
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

26:01.360 --> 26:03.863
EVIDENCE. HERE WE GO.

26:03.896 --> 26:07.233
HE CHANGED HIS PASSWORD,
BUT I'M IN.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.707
Emily: WOW.

26:14.741 --> 26:16.643
YOU'RE REALLY GIFTED
AT THIS TOO.

26:16.676 --> 26:18.711
FRESHMAN YEAR,
I LIVED IN THIS OFFICE.

26:18.745 --> 26:21.881
MR. T's SECRETARY WAS,
LIKE, MY ONLY FRIEND.

26:25.051 --> 26:26.953
LOOK, HON,
IF YOU'RE TOO PARANOID...

26:26.986 --> 26:29.055
WHAT?
IF YOU WANT ME TO STOP...

26:29.088 --> 26:31.090
NO. TYPE. I'M JUST...

26:31.123 --> 26:32.825
LOCKING THE DOOR.

26:32.859 --> 26:35.227
( lock clicks )

26:41.133 --> 26:42.368
IS IT EMPTY?

26:42.401 --> 26:45.004
NOT YET.

26:45.037 --> 26:47.273
REMIND ME WHY WE
VOLUNTEERED FOR THIS EVENT.

26:47.306 --> 26:48.741
( distant
train whistle blows )

26:48.775 --> 26:50.843
WELL, I THINK
THE TRUTH IS OVERRATED.

26:50.877 --> 26:52.178
I COULD STAND
TO HEAR SOME MORE.

26:52.211 --> 26:53.946
WELL, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

26:53.980 --> 26:57.083
I DON'T THINK HANNA DID
WHAT SHE'S ACCUSED OF.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.685
IT COULD VERY WELL
JUST BE SOMEONE

26:58.718 --> 27:00.386
TRYING TO MAKE HER
LOOK BAD.

27:00.419 --> 27:02.689
WHY? TO WHAT END?

27:02.722 --> 27:04.256
I DON'T KNOW.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.892
MAYBE IT'S JUST ME,

27:05.925 --> 27:08.828
BUT I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING'S
HAPPENED TO OUR GIRLS.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.663
I'VE TRIED
TO PROTECT HANNA,

27:10.697 --> 27:12.799
BUT WHEN SHE LOST ALISON...

27:12.832 --> 27:15.101
THAT'S WHY
WE WENT OVERSEAS.

27:15.134 --> 27:18.270
IT WAS JUST TO GIVE ARIA
SOMETHING ELSE TO THINK ABOUT

27:18.304 --> 27:20.673
BESIDES THAT.

27:20.707 --> 27:24.376
I DON'T THINK THE MOMENT
WAS WHEN THEY LOST ALISON.

27:24.410 --> 27:27.747
I THINK IT WAS
WHEN THEY MET ALISON.

27:32.018 --> 27:34.721
GO BACK TO "SPRING TRAINING."
I THINK I SAW SOMETHING.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.092
PERFECT.

27:40.126 --> 27:42.762
NOW OPEN UP THE EXPENSE
REPORTS FOR APRIL.

27:45.031 --> 27:48.868
WELL! BASTE ME IN BLING
AND CALL ME BULGARI.

27:48.901 --> 27:51.137
MONA, WH-WHAT ARE YOU SEEING?

27:51.170 --> 27:52.972
HOW RYAN GIRALDO
GOT BACK ON THE TEAM

27:53.005 --> 27:55.307
AFTER HE WAS CAUGHT TAGGING.

27:55.341 --> 27:56.909
WHERE ARE YOU SEEING THAT?

27:56.943 --> 27:58.978
HIS FATHER OWNS THAT
DANISH FURNITURE STORE.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.914
THE FANCY CHAIR
YOU'RE SITTING ON
RETAILS FOR TWO THOUSAND.

28:01.948 --> 28:05.451
MR. T TURNED IN
A RECEIPT FOR $29.99.

28:05.484 --> 28:07.486
SHE SHOOTS, SHE SCORES.

28:07.519 --> 28:08.888
OKAY, WAIT.

28:08.921 --> 28:11.157
SO TAMBORELLI TOOK
THE CHAIR AS A BRIBE?

28:11.190 --> 28:15.694
YES, MA'AM, AND NOW
WE CAN USE IT TO GET YOU
BACK IN THE SHARKS.

28:19.131 --> 28:20.432
MONA, STOP.

28:20.466 --> 28:22.134
I CAN'T BLACKMAIL
A SCHOOL OFFICIAL.

28:22.168 --> 28:24.403
HONEY, YOU CAN'T BE
A SHARK IF YOU'RE TOOTHLESS.

28:27.339 --> 28:29.809
SAME NUMBER, SAME HOUSE.

28:29.842 --> 28:31.143
YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME.

28:31.177 --> 28:32.311
( beep )

28:34.446 --> 28:36.749
I JUST LEFT YOUR HUSBAND
A MESSAGE.

28:36.783 --> 28:38.517
TURNS OUT HE'S NOT
OUT OF TOWN.

28:38.550 --> 28:41.821
YOU'RE RIGHT.

28:41.854 --> 28:44.023
BUT IT'S REALLY NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS WHERE HE IS.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.491
OH, IT'S MY BUSINESS.

28:45.524 --> 28:47.126
IT'S ALWAYS
BEEN MY BUSINESS.

28:47.159 --> 28:48.895
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW THAT
UNTIL RECENTLY.

28:48.928 --> 28:50.997
JASON, THIS DAY IS ABOUT
FORGING NEW CONNECTIONS.

28:52.431 --> 28:54.333
ARE YOU SURE THAT THIS
IS THE RIGHT APPROACH?

28:54.366 --> 28:57.103
WELL, THAT DEPENDS ON
HOW YOU LOOK AT IT,
MRS. HASTINGS.

28:57.136 --> 28:58.404
IT'S ALSO
ABOUT COMING CLEAN

28:58.437 --> 29:01.007
AND OWNING UP
TO THE TRUTH, BUT, HEY,

29:01.040 --> 29:03.409
IF YOU WANT TO STAY
IN DENIAL, GO FOR IT.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.377
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.780
SO, ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

29:07.814 --> 29:09.315
SOME DUDE IN GERMANY
WENT ON A DATING WEBSITE

29:09.348 --> 29:12.118
AND ADVERTISED FOR SOMEONE
HE COULD KILL AND EAT.

29:12.151 --> 29:14.453
SHUT UP.

29:14.486 --> 29:18.057
I'M SERIOUS.
AND GOT, LIKE,
220 RESPONSES.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.960
WHY DOES EVERY WOMAN
THINK THAT SHE CAN
CHANGE A GUY?

29:20.993 --> 29:25.031
ALI, ARE YOU EVEN
GOING TO TAKE THIS TEST?

29:25.064 --> 29:28.100
Veronica: WE'VE BEEN
NEIGHBORS FOR 15 YEARS!

29:28.134 --> 29:30.970
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOUR MOM AND DAD?

29:31.003 --> 29:32.238
ARE THEY SPLITTING UP?

29:32.271 --> 29:33.372
NO.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.044
DO THEY DO THIS EVERY NIGHT?

29:38.077 --> 29:40.012
NO, MY DAD'S JUST UPSET.

29:40.046 --> 29:42.849
YOUR BROTHER GAVE
MELISSA A RIDE HOME
FROM PHILLY, AND...

29:42.882 --> 29:45.251
THEY GOT CAUGHT
MAKING OUT IN THE CAR.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.319
SERIOUSLY?!

29:47.353 --> 29:48.888
OPEN THE DOOR.

29:48.921 --> 29:50.422
ALI, STOP. I DON'T
WANT TO HEAR THIS.

29:50.456 --> 29:53.159
I DO. JASON AND MELISSA?

29:53.192 --> 29:55.527
THAT'S JUICIER THAN THE GUY
THAT EATS HIS DATES.

29:55.561 --> 29:57.496
MY DAD IS FREAKING OUT
OVER NOTHING.

29:57.529 --> 29:59.932
MELISSA'S OBSESSED WITH IAN.
SHE DOESN'T EVEN LIKE JASON.

29:59.966 --> 30:02.568
Veronica: ...A KISS.
I THINK YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

30:02.601 --> 30:03.936
SHE'D BETTER NOT.

30:03.970 --> 30:05.037
WHY NOT?

30:05.071 --> 30:07.106
( argument continues )

30:07.139 --> 30:09.909
LET'S JUST SAY IT WOULD
BE A MATCH FROWNED UPON
BY THE GODS.

30:27.559 --> 30:30.129
HEY. WE TRIED
TEXTING YOU.

30:30.162 --> 30:32.131
CALEB HAS MY PHONE.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.366
ARE THOSE SALTED?
PLEASE SAY YES.

30:41.974 --> 30:43.442
COME ON, LET'S--
LET'S GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

30:43.475 --> 30:44.977
NO. I'M FINE.

30:45.011 --> 30:46.578
Man on P.A.:
 YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE.

30:46.612 --> 30:48.915
AFTER THE DINNER BREAK,
 ALL STUDENTS MUST ATTEND

30:48.948 --> 30:51.283
THE FILM BEING SCREENED
 IN ROOM 109.

30:51.317 --> 30:55.354
AGAIN, ROOM 109
 AT SEVEN P.M. THANK YOU.

30:55.387 --> 30:57.356
WAIT. WHY DID TAMBORELLI
CALL YOU DOWN?

30:57.389 --> 30:58.958
SHE HAS A BIRTHMARK!

30:58.991 --> 31:00.626
OKAY.

31:00.659 --> 31:02.094
EM, DO YOU STILL HAVE IT--

31:02.128 --> 31:03.395
THAT PHOTO FROM
THE LOCKER ROOM?

31:03.429 --> 31:06.665
YEAH, I THINK SO. WHY?

31:06.698 --> 31:09.035
HAN, WHAT--
WHAT'S GOING ON?

31:09.068 --> 31:11.137
THERE WASN'T A BIRTHMARK
IN THAT PHOTO! WHERE IS IT?

31:11.170 --> 31:12.638
WHAT?!
LOOK!

31:12.671 --> 31:15.107
LOOK, THERE'S NO BIRTHMARK!
IT WAS PHOTOSHOPPED!

31:15.141 --> 31:17.076
Y-YOU THINK SHE
STUCK HER HEAD ON
SOMEBODY ELSE'S BODY?

31:17.109 --> 31:18.911
YES.

31:18.945 --> 31:21.580
WHY WOULD "A" GO TO ALL THAT
TROUBLE TO PHOTOSHOP HER BODY?

31:21.613 --> 31:24.083
IF-- IF SHE WAS TRYING
TO EMBARRASS HER,

31:24.116 --> 31:26.118
WHY WOULD SHE IMPROVE HER?

31:26.152 --> 31:28.387
WHAT IF IT WASN'T "A"
WHO TOOK THAT PHOTO

31:28.420 --> 31:29.688
AND SENT IT FROM MY PHONE?

31:29.721 --> 31:31.257
WELL, WHO DID?

31:44.370 --> 31:46.005
THE DAMAGE HAS
ALREADY BEEN DONE.

31:46.038 --> 31:48.140
I DIDN'T SNAP THAT
PICTURE OF YOU, KATE...

31:48.174 --> 31:50.542
BUT I THINK I KNOW WHO DID.
WHO?

31:50.576 --> 31:53.445
LET'S JUST SAY I'M NO STRANGER
TO THE MAGIC OF PHOTOSHOP.

31:53.479 --> 31:56.315
I MEAN, I SPENT
ALL OF NINTH GRADE
TRIMMING MY THIGHS.

31:56.348 --> 31:58.484
MMM. AND I CARE BECAUSE...?

31:58.517 --> 32:00.953
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I'M STARTING TO THINK

32:00.987 --> 32:04.190
THAT SOMEONE PUT YOUR HEAD
ON A MUCH BETTER BODY.

32:04.223 --> 32:06.258
( chuckles )
EXCUSE ME?

32:06.292 --> 32:09.528
WELL, FOR ONE,
YOUR CHEST WAS
DEFINITELY ENHANCED.

32:09.561 --> 32:11.297
GUESS AGAIN, HANNA.

32:11.330 --> 32:13.465
SOME OF US DON'T HAVE
TO WORK AS HARD AS YOU DO.

32:13.499 --> 32:16.302
SO, YOU DIDN'T ENHANCE.
YOU JUST ERASED.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.338
THE BIRTHMARK
ABOVE YOUR WAIST.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.107
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.641
YES, YOU DO.

32:22.674 --> 32:24.576
YOU KNOW, NEXT TIME
I'D BE A LITTLE BIT
MORE CAREFUL

32:24.610 --> 32:27.013
WHEN YOU'RE TAKING
A SWEATER OFF IN PUBLIC.

32:28.580 --> 32:31.450
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT, KATE?
WHY WOULD YOU TAKE A PHOTO--?

32:31.483 --> 32:33.719
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

32:33.752 --> 32:36.188
WAIT FOR YOUR STUCK-UP
BFF TO DOWNLOAD

32:36.222 --> 32:38.157
HIDEOUS PICTURES OF ME
FROM RIDING CAMP.

32:38.190 --> 32:40.292
LIKE I COULDN'T
SEE THAT COMING!

32:40.326 --> 32:44.630
YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT'S TIME
I REALLY TOOK A PICTURE
OF YOU, KATE.

32:44.663 --> 32:47.066
ARIA, CAN I
BORROW YOUR PHONE?

32:47.099 --> 32:49.168
YEAH, IN A MINUTE.
I'M USING IT, THOUGH.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.271
TO RECORD THIS CONVERSATION.

32:58.777 --> 33:00.746
MY MOM HAS GOT TO HEAR THIS.

33:00.779 --> 33:02.748
I CAN'T BELIEVE KATE WOULD
SEND THAT OUT HERSELF.

33:02.781 --> 33:04.616
I MEAN, THAT'S PSYCHO.
NO, IT'S GENIUS.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.218
THE FIRST WEEK OF SCHOOL,
SHE TAKES DOWN HANNA

33:06.252 --> 33:07.619
AND MAKES EVERY GIRL
PITY HER

33:07.653 --> 33:09.221
AND MAKES EVERY GUY
WANT TO POUNCE ON HER.

33:09.255 --> 33:10.389
OKAY, NOT EVERY GUY.

33:10.422 --> 33:11.690
CALEB WANTS
TO STRANGLE HER.

33:11.723 --> 33:13.259
YOU NEED
TO TELL HIM TO STOP.

33:13.292 --> 33:14.426
STOP HIM FROM WHAT?

33:14.460 --> 33:15.794
FROM TRYING
TO CRACK MY PHONE.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.363
HE STILL
THINKS JENNA DID IT.

33:17.396 --> 33:19.098
YOU HAVE
TO TEL HIM TO QUIT.

33:19.131 --> 33:20.332
BUT WHY ME?
BECAUSE YOU'RE
IN THE SAME GROUP.

33:20.366 --> 33:22.301
NOW, GO CHECK
THE MUSIC ROOM.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.570
WHAT IF HE'S NOT IN THERE?
WELL, THEN,
CHECK THE ROOFTOP.

33:24.603 --> 33:26.338
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
JENNA SNIFFING OUT
WHAT HE'S DOING.

33:26.372 --> 33:27.606
SHE'S GOT EYES EVERYWHERE.

33:27.639 --> 33:29.475
NOW, GO.
I HAVE TO FIND MY MOM.

33:53.399 --> 33:55.334
Noel:
LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY?

33:57.236 --> 34:01.240
UM... YEAH.
I-I JUST THOUGHT
CALEB WAS IN HERE.

34:01.273 --> 34:02.508
HE'S NOT.

34:02.541 --> 34:03.775
IS HE MISSING?

34:03.809 --> 34:05.244
HOPE SO.
( chuckles )

34:05.277 --> 34:06.778
MAYBE... SOMEBODY
THREW HIM OUT

34:06.812 --> 34:09.348
WITH THE REST OF
THE GARBAGE.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.083
HMM.
( chuckles )

34:11.117 --> 34:13.819
YEAH. OKAY. UM...

34:13.851 --> 34:15.487
WELL, IF-- IF HE
COMES BACK HERE--

34:15.521 --> 34:16.655
HE'D BETTER NOT.

34:30.768 --> 34:32.304
WERE YOU AWAKE FOR THAT?

34:43.649 --> 34:44.815
CALEB?

34:54.560 --> 34:56.362
CALEB, ARE YOU UP HERE?

35:02.301 --> 35:03.469
CALEB.

35:17.216 --> 35:19.385
( message indicator plinks )

35:51.350 --> 35:53.219
JASON...

35:54.753 --> 35:56.255
I HAVE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

35:58.357 --> 35:59.858
JUST HEAR ME OUT. PLEASE.

36:05.331 --> 36:06.532
DID YOU...

36:08.500 --> 36:10.436
ARE YOU BACK BECAUSE...

36:13.472 --> 36:14.640
MY DAD...

36:16.642 --> 36:18.710
IS YOUR FATHER TOO?

36:20.646 --> 36:22.581
WHO TOLD YOU?

36:24.283 --> 36:25.451
ALI.

36:27.253 --> 36:28.820
A LONG TIME AGO.
I JUST...

36:31.523 --> 36:33.559
I DIDN'T HEAR IT
UNTIL TONIGHT.

36:43.269 --> 36:46.405
CALEB?
( door closes )

36:47.573 --> 36:48.740
HELLO?

36:57.416 --> 36:58.650
OH, DAMN IT!

36:58.684 --> 37:00.719
( pounding )

37:00.752 --> 37:02.521
CAN ANYBODY HEAR ME?

37:04.490 --> 37:07.426
CAN ANYONE PLEASE
OPEN THIS DOOR?

37:09.027 --> 37:10.396
HELLO?

37:13.031 --> 37:14.400
CRAP?

37:19.938 --> 37:21.340
( loud thud )

37:22.541 --> 37:24.843
WHO IS THAT?

37:24.876 --> 37:27.045
IS SOMEBODY UP HERE?

37:27.078 --> 37:28.714
Oh, my God.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.021
AAH!

37:36.054 --> 37:37.623
LET GO OF ME!

37:37.656 --> 37:38.990
LET GO!

37:39.024 --> 37:40.926
WHERE'S YOUR PAL CALEB?
GET AWAY FROM ME!

37:42.661 --> 37:45.964
( Noel groans )

37:47.366 --> 37:48.800
ARIA, COME ON DOWN.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.872
WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG
WITH YOU, IDIOT?

37:53.905 --> 37:55.273
I WASN'T ATTACKING HER!

38:05.384 --> 38:07.553
( panting and gasping )

38:09.621 --> 38:10.689
YOU OKAY?

38:11.790 --> 38:13.325
( mumbles affirmatively )

38:13.359 --> 38:15.761
WH-WHERE DID YOU LEARN
TO KICK SOMEBODY LIKE THAT?

38:15.794 --> 38:19.398
AND DON'T YOU TELL ME
THAT YOU PICKED IT UP
IN PORTUGAL, OKAY?

38:19.431 --> 38:21.500
WAIT.

38:21.533 --> 38:23.068
IS THIS PART OF THE SECRET?

38:23.101 --> 38:25.637
YOUR BRUISE-- DID SOMEBODY
JUMP ON YOU LIKE THAT?

38:25.671 --> 38:27.539
COME ON.

38:27.573 --> 38:29.341
LET'S GET AWAY FROM HERE.

38:57.002 --> 38:58.370
DONE.

38:58.404 --> 38:59.170
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, DONE?

39:00.672 --> 39:02.441
DOES HE KNOW
WE WERE IN HIS OFFICE?

39:02.474 --> 39:04.710
WE DIDN'T GET TO THAT PART.
I JUST TOLD HIM FOOTBALL PLAYERS

39:04.743 --> 39:06.745
TALK A LOT WHEN THEY'RE
NOT ON THE FIELD.

39:06.778 --> 39:08.880
OKAY, MONA, HE CANNOT
KNOW THAT WE WERE--
HE WON'T.

39:08.914 --> 39:11.883
CONGRATULATIONS, HON.
YOU'RE BACK ON THE TEAM.

39:11.917 --> 39:14.686
IF I HAD A POM-POM,
I'D SHAKE IT.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.655
( soft chuckle )

39:16.688 --> 39:19.825
UH... WHY WOULD YOU
DO THIS FOR ME?

39:19.858 --> 39:22.828
IT WAS FUN.
THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS DO.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.563
BUT NOW YOU'VE GOT
TO HELP ME.

39:24.596 --> 39:27.699
WHAT DO PEOPLE WEAR
TO A SWIM MEET?

39:27.733 --> 39:30.436
IF I SHOW UP IN MY WEDGES,
ARE THEY GONNA GET MUSHY?

39:30.469 --> 39:31.637
( laughing )

39:33.605 --> 39:35.541
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
MY MOM IS?
UH, NO.

39:47.185 --> 39:48.587
WHERE'S KATE?

39:48.620 --> 39:50.689
SHE AND HANNA ARE INSIDE.

39:50.722 --> 39:53.892
MR. TAMBORELLI WANTED
TO SPEAK TO THE GIRLS
BEFORE HE INCLUDED US.

39:53.925 --> 39:55.494
WHAT'S GOING ON?

39:55.527 --> 39:57.429
WHAT, DID HANNA PICK
ANOTHER FIGHT?

39:57.463 --> 40:00.666
NO, BUT SHE MAY HAVE
ENDED THIS ONE.

40:00.699 --> 40:04.202
IN THE FUTURE, ISABEL,
BEFORE YOU POINT FINGERS,

40:04.235 --> 40:06.137
YOU MAY WANT
TO TAKE A WHIFF
OF THE ROTTEN FRUIT

40:06.171 --> 40:08.106
UNDER YOUR FAMILY TREE.

40:08.139 --> 40:09.641
( door opens )

40:19.084 --> 40:21.219
Spencer: WHY AM I
THE LAST TO KNOW?

40:21.252 --> 40:23.822
Veronica: YOU'RE NOT.
MELISSA DOESN'T KNOW EITHER.

40:23.855 --> 40:25.123
WHAT?!

40:25.156 --> 40:27.058
HOW COULD YOU NOT TELL HER?

40:27.092 --> 40:28.994
HOW COULD YOU
BE OKAY WITH THIS?

40:29.027 --> 40:31.863
HOW CAN YOU GO ON
LIVING NEXT DOOR TO THEM
FOR ALL OF THESE YEARS?

40:31.897 --> 40:33.465
I DIDN'T KNOW.

40:33.499 --> 40:35.601
I DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL
JASON WAS NEARLY AN ADULT,

40:35.634 --> 40:38.670
AND BY THEN, YOUR FATHER
AND I, WE DISCUSSED IT.

40:38.704 --> 40:40.005
YOU DISCUSSED WHAT?

40:40.038 --> 40:41.640
HOW HE WAS GONNA
TELL HIS DAUGHTERS

40:41.673 --> 40:43.509
THAT HE WAS GOING ON
A FATHER-SON FISHING TRIP

40:43.542 --> 40:44.976
WITH THE KID NEXT DOOR?

40:45.010 --> 40:46.645
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU FEEL ANGRY

40:46.678 --> 40:48.179
AND CONFUSED AND BETRAYED.

40:48.213 --> 40:50.048
BELIEVE ME, I DID TOO,

40:50.081 --> 40:51.917
AND SOMETIMES I STILL DO,

40:51.950 --> 40:53.652
BUT I'VE HAD TO GET PAST IT.

40:53.685 --> 40:54.853
HOW?!

40:54.886 --> 40:57.222
SPENCER, EVERY FAMILY
HAS SECRETS.

40:57.255 --> 41:00.626
IF I HAD KNOWN BEFORE,
THEN I WOULD HAVE MADE
A DIFFERENT DECISION,

41:00.659 --> 41:02.127
AND YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.829
( sighs )

41:03.862 --> 41:05.997
HONEY, PLEASE, LET'S GO HOME
AND TALK TO YOUR FATHER.

41:06.031 --> 41:07.833
NO. I DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO HIM.

41:07.866 --> 41:09.267
I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO LOOK AT HIM.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.169
SPENCER, THIS DOESN'T
REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING.

41:11.202 --> 41:12.571
NO, THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING!

41:13.872 --> 41:15.206
HONEY, PLEASE.

41:16.875 --> 41:18.944
LET'S GO HOME.
WHAT IS HOME?

41:21.312 --> 41:23.114
THAT'S A JOKE.

41:38.930 --> 41:41.499
Female Vocalist:
 * WHEN YOU'RE WEARY

41:44.570 --> 41:46.872
* AND HAUNTED

41:49.708 --> 41:52.644
* THERE IS NO SIGN

41:54.846 --> 41:57.816
* WE'LL EVER CROSS

41:57.849 --> 42:00.051
* YOU SHOULD KNOW NOW

42:02.721 --> 42:05.857
* THAT I FEEL THE LOSS

42:08.994 --> 42:12.698
( vocalizing )

42:12.731 --> 42:14.833
SPENCE?

42:14.866 --> 42:16.568
WHAT TIME IS IT?

42:18.169 --> 42:20.839
* HURT TOO

42:25.243 --> 42:26.778
OH, MY GOD.

42:26.812 --> 42:29.781
I GOT, LIKE,
SIX MISSED CALLS
FROM THAT NUMBER.

42:29.815 --> 42:32.884
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT-- WHAT NUMBER?

42:32.918 --> 42:34.686
WHERE THE HELL AM I?

42:34.720 --> 42:37.623
THE NUMBER IN ALI'S RAINCOAT.
( cellphone vibrates )

42:37.656 --> 42:39.124
WHO'S CALLING NOW?

42:39.157 --> 42:40.892
Emily: THE SAME NUMBER.

42:40.926 --> 42:41.960
DO I ANSWER IT?

42:41.993 --> 42:43.294
YES, ANSWER IT.

42:43.328 --> 42:46.832
( cellphone vibrates )

42:46.865 --> 42:48.133
HELLO?

42:48.166 --> 42:49.701
Man: HEY, IS THIS
 VIVIAN'S FRIEND?

42:49.735 --> 42:52.237
Y-YES. YES, IT IS.

42:52.270 --> 42:53.639
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

42:54.873 --> 42:59.077
I... WAS CALLING...
BECAUSE WE, UM...

42:59.110 --> 43:00.612
I HAD A FEW QUESTIONS.

43:00.646 --> 43:02.280
YEAH, WELL,
 I HAVE A FEW MYSELF,

43:02.313 --> 43:04.750
BUT I DON'T WANT
 TO DO THIS ON A PHONE.

43:04.783 --> 43:06.752
WILL YOU MEET ME?

43:10.021 --> 43:11.356
YES.

43:12.724 --> 43:14.225
I WILL.
