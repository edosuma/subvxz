WEBVTT

00:01.794 --> 00:03.044
(June) EVER SINCE I MOVED

00:01.794 --> 00:03.044
TO NEW YORK,

00:03.086 --> 00:05.046
I'VE MADE AN EFFORT

00:03.086 --> 00:05.046
TO BE FRIENDLY...

00:05.088 --> 00:08.049
HELLO, SIR. (chuckles)

00:05.088 --> 00:08.049
OH.

00:08.091 --> 00:09.259
IT'S LIKE WE'RE DANCING.

00:09.301 --> 00:10.928
MOVE OR I'LL KICK YOU

00:09.301 --> 00:10.928
IN THE CLAM!

00:10.970 --> 00:14.431
BUT LATELY IT'S FEELING

00:10.970 --> 00:14.431
A LITTLE ONE-SIDED.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.308
NEW YORKERS ALWAYS SEEM

00:14.473 --> 00:16.308
TO BE IN A RUSH.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.268
THEY NEVER EVEN STOP

00:16.350 --> 00:18.268
TO GET TO KNOW THEIR NEIGHBORS.

00:18.310 --> 00:21.104
OH, HI, I'M JUNE.

00:18.310 --> 00:21.104
I DON'T THINK THAT WE'VE MET--

00:21.146 --> 00:22.063
AAH!

00:22.105 --> 00:23.106
GAH!

00:23.148 --> 00:25.400
HAVE A GOOD DAY!

00:28.111 --> 00:32.366
PERFECT. A CAPTIVE AUDIENCE

00:28.111 --> 00:32.366
FOR MY INDIANA CHARM.

00:32.407 --> 00:34.743
BUILDING, MEET JUNE.

00:39.915 --> 00:41.792
OH. COOKIES. FUN.

00:41.834 --> 00:44.127
IS IT A COWORKER'S BIRTHDAY?

00:41.834 --> 00:44.127
(blows raspberry)

00:44.169 --> 00:47.088
I'M BRINGING THEM

00:44.169 --> 00:47.088
TO THE TENANTS MEETING.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.590
I WANT TO MEET OUR NEIGHBORS.

00:48.632 --> 00:50.133
BACK IN INDIANA,

00:48.632 --> 00:50.133
I WAS THE BEST NEIGHBOR.

00:50.175 --> 00:54.513
I USED TO FEED PEOPLE'S CATS,

00:50.175 --> 00:54.513
AND WATER PLANTS, AND GET MAIL.

00:54.555 --> 00:55.806
OH, SO YOU WERE MY GRANDMA.

00:55.848 --> 00:57.975
TURN DOWN THE JUDGMENT,

00:55.848 --> 00:57.975
JUDGE JUNEY.

00:58.017 --> 01:00.394
I AM ALSO GOING

00:58.017 --> 01:00.394
TO THE TENANTS MEETING.

01:00.435 --> 01:02.103
REALLY?

01:00.435 --> 01:02.103
YEAH.

01:00.435 --> 01:02.103
I SAW A NEW FAMILY MOVED IN

01:02.145 --> 01:05.106
AND I WANT TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

01:02.145 --> 01:05.106
I KNOW HOW TO BE NICE.

01:05.148 --> 01:06.149
HMM.

01:06.191 --> 01:07.943
(gasps)

01:07.985 --> 01:11.822
OH. I GUESS IT'S ALWAYS

01:07.985 --> 01:11.822
GONNA BE FLOUR WITH YOU.

01:14.157 --> 01:17.160
SO THE STOOP HANDRAILS

01:14.157 --> 01:17.160
WILL BE PAINTED ON TUESDAY.

01:17.202 --> 01:19.747
A REMINDER--

01:17.202 --> 01:19.747
WE DO ENCOURAGE DOORMATS.

01:19.788 --> 01:21.582
AND THE BUILDING TRIP TO ATLANTA

01:19.788 --> 01:21.582
HAS BEEN CANCELED

01:21.623 --> 01:24.125
DUE TO LACK OF FUNDS,

01:21.623 --> 01:24.125
NOT LACK OF INTEREST.

01:24.167 --> 01:25.586
NO!

01:27.212 --> 01:28.422
OKAY, NEXT ORDER

01:28.463 --> 01:31.550

01:28.463 --> 01:31.550

01:31.592 --> 01:35.136

01:36.221 --> 01:38.139
(woman) HI.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.601
CHLOE? UH, YOU DON'T...

01:47.190 --> 01:49.026
WHERE'S THE NEW FAMILY?

01:49.068 --> 01:50.193

01:50.235 --> 01:53.447
HI THERE. I'M CHLOE.

01:50.235 --> 01:53.447
I LIVE IN APARTMENT 23.

01:53.488 --> 01:55.824
HOW OLD ARE YOU? 16? 17?

01:55.866 --> 01:56.992

UGH.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.073
I WAS 18.

02:36.115 --> 02:37.198
HE WAS 17.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.200
IT WAS SWEET.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.200
WE HELD HANDS AND PASSED NOTES,

02:39.242 --> 02:42.245
THEN WE HAD SEX IN THE BACK

02:39.242 --> 02:42.245
OF HIS DAD'S DELIVERY TRUCK.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.831
ANYWAY, HIS PARENTS HATED ME,

02:43.872 --> 02:45.457
SO THEY PROSECUTED

02:43.872 --> 02:45.457
TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THE LAW.

02:54.967 --> 02:58.137
CURFEWS, BODY SPRAYS,

02:54.967 --> 02:58.137
DOODLES OF FIGHTER JETS...

02:58.177 --> 03:01.222
(sighs) NOW THE NEIGHBORS HATE

02:58.177 --> 03:01.222
US. THE NEIGHBORS HATE US NOW.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.432
YOU KNOW WHO I HATE?

03:02.474 --> 03:05.894
SINGLE MOMS. THEY MAKE

03:02.474 --> 03:05.894
SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT.

03:09.356 --> 03:12.109
CHLOE WAS 2 1/2 MONTHS OLDER

03:09.356 --> 03:12.109
THAN THAT BOY.

03:12.151 --> 03:16.237
SHE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN

03:12.151 --> 03:16.237
THAT IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE.

03:16.279 --> 03:18.866
YOU'RE ACTING VERY WEIRD.

03:16.279 --> 03:18.866
ARE YOU DRUNK?

03:18.907 --> 03:20.075
ON FREEDOM!

03:20.117 --> 03:21.284
JENNIFER AND I BROKE UP!

03:21.326 --> 03:23.244
SHE FINALLY DUMPED ME!

03:23.286 --> 03:24.538
OH, I'M SORRY.

03:24.579 --> 03:27.082
DON'T BE. I FEEL GREAT.

03:24.579 --> 03:27.082
I'M FREE OF ALL THE RULES.

03:27.124 --> 03:29.543
NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT

03:27.124 --> 03:29.543
ABOUT ME?

03:29.584 --> 03:32.921
I GREW IN MY BURNS.

03:29.584 --> 03:32.921
JENNIFER HATED HAIR.

03:32.963 --> 03:36.257
SHE ALSO BANNED REGGAE MUSIC,

03:32.963 --> 03:36.257
FANTASY FOOTBALL, AND TANK TOPS,

03:36.299 --> 03:39.260
BUT NO MORE!

03:39.302 --> 03:40.303
(chuckles)

03:40.345 --> 03:41.847
HELLO, SHOULDERS.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.307
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE

03:41.889 --> 03:44.307
YOU'VE BEEN OUT IN THE WORLD.

03:44.349 --> 03:45.976
WE HAVE

03:44.349 --> 03:45.976
A HALF-BLACK PRESIDENT NOW.

03:46.018 --> 03:50.313
I THINK HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB

03:46.018 --> 03:50.313
DESPITE A VERY HOSTILE CONGRESS.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.273
(laughs) YOU'RE FUN.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.984
JENNIFER WAS NOT FUN.

03:54.026 --> 03:55.569
OH, YOU'RE INVITED

03:54.026 --> 03:55.569
TO THE BRUNCH I'M THROWING.

03:55.610 --> 03:58.279
BRUNCH? THAT'S

03:55.610 --> 03:58.279
YOUR FIRST SINGLE GUY MOVE?

03:58.321 --> 04:00.157
NOT STRIPPERS OR GOLF?

04:00.199 --> 04:02.993
JENNIFER ALWAYS MADE ME SPEND

04:00.199 --> 04:02.993
SUNDAYS HIKING WITH HER CATS.

04:03.035 --> 04:05.286
BUT THIS SUNDAY,

04:03.035 --> 04:05.286
THERE ARE NO RULES!

04:05.328 --> 04:07.288
YOU CAN HAVE A MIMOSA

04:05.328 --> 04:07.288
OR A COFFEE,

04:07.330 --> 04:09.583
WATCH THE GAME

04:07.330 --> 04:09.583
OR READ THE PAPER.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.919
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T HAVE TO

04:09.624 --> 04:11.919
PUT SUNSCREEN ON A CAT,

04:11.960 --> 04:14.046
IT'S ALL GOOD.

04:15.047 --> 04:18.299
(Chloe giggling)

04:18.341 --> 04:20.969
(man moans)

04:21.011 --> 04:22.137
I'M GOING TO BED.

04:22.179 --> 04:24.305
CAN YOU AT LEAST HOLD OFF

04:22.179 --> 04:24.305
ON THE SEX NOISES

04:24.347 --> 04:25.557
UNTIL I GET MY EARPLUGS IN?

04:25.599 --> 04:27.308
OH, YOU CAN'T GO IN YOUR ROOM.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.310
NO, IT'S ALL GOOD.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.310
WE'RE DONE.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.312
WHAT? IN MY ROOM?

04:31.354 --> 04:33.314
GOOD NIGHT OUT.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.358
OH, F.Y.I.--I WORE YOUR

04:33.356 --> 04:35.358
PAJAMA PANTS FOR A WHILE.

OH, WELL, I'M REALLY BAD WITH

04:43.992 --> 04:47.328

04:47.370 --> 04:49.039
CHLOE, THIS GUY HAS

04:47.370 --> 04:49.039
A GIRLFRIEND.

04:49.081 --> 04:52.167
SO? SOMEONE TOLD ME HE'S ONLY

04:49.081 --> 04:52.167
WITH HER BECAUSE SHE'S BIPOLAR.

04:52.209 --> 04:53.501
YEAH, I TOLD YOU THAT.

04:53.543 --> 04:54.836
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

04:53.543 --> 04:54.836
I'LL FIX IT.

04:54.878 --> 04:58.215
I'M JUST GONNA FLASH

04:54.878 --> 04:58.215

04:58.257 --> 05:00.217
HI.

WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

05:02.385 --> 05:03.428

05:03.470 --> 05:04.846
(man) GOD KNOWS

05:03.470 --> 05:04.846
WHAT GOES ON IN THERE.

05:04.888 --> 05:07.599
(woman) LOOK AT THOSE TWO SLUTS.

05:04.888 --> 05:07.599
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEM.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.810
OF COURSE MISS MEGAN'S LAW

05:07.641 --> 05:09.810
AND HER ROOMMATE ARE WHORES.

05:09.851 --> 05:12.395
IT'S LIKE A DUTCH BROTHEL

05:09.851 --> 05:12.395
IN THERE.

05:12.437 --> 05:13.396
I'M GOING IN.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.856
ANTHONY, NO!

05:14.898 --> 05:19.236
OUR NEIGHBORS HATE ME

05:14.898 --> 05:19.236
BECAUSE OF YOU!

05:19.278 --> 05:21.362
I AM A SLUT BY ASSOCIATION.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.865
ARE YOU EVEN AWARE

05:21.404 --> 05:23.865
OF YOUR BEHAVIOR?

05:23.907 --> 05:28.662
I MEAN, HAVE YOU EVER IN YOUR

05:23.907 --> 05:28.662
LIFE DATED AN APPROPRIATE GUY?

05:29.579 --> 05:32.874
♪♪♪

05:52.435 --> 05:54.562
LOOK, I CAN'T HELP IT.

05:54.604 --> 05:57.065
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN DRAWN

05:54.604 --> 05:57.065
TO INAPPROPRIATE MEN.

05:57.107 --> 05:59.651
IT'S SO FUN THOUGH.

05:57.107 --> 05:59.651
I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.029
OH, REALLY? YOU THINK SO?

FINE. JUST FOLLOW ME.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.631

06:21.673 --> 06:24.425
WHERE ARE WE?

06:21.673 --> 06:24.425
I CAN BARELY SEE.

06:24.467 --> 06:27.428
A COUGAR BAR

06:24.467 --> 06:27.428
CALLED SADDLEBAGS.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.056
ARE THOSE...

06:29.097 --> 06:30.891
YES, THEY ARE.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.434
(woman) I CAN NO LONGER

06:30.932 --> 06:33.434
GET PREGNANT.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.020
I CAN NO LONGER

06:33.476 --> 06:35.020
GET PREGNANT.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.437
(woman) MY C-SECTION SCARS

06:35.062 --> 06:36.437
HAVE FADED COMPLETELY.

06:36.479 --> 06:40.025
(woman) I'VE HAD MY I.U.D. IN

06:36.479 --> 06:40.025
FOR 34 YEARS.

06:40.067 --> 06:44.071
(woman) I WAS AN ALTERNATE

06:40.067 --> 06:44.071
ON THE 1976 U.S. SWIM TEAM.

06:44.112 --> 06:47.448
(slurps loudly)

06:47.490 --> 06:50.451
SEE HOW WELL

06:47.490 --> 06:50.451
I SUCKED THAT DOWN?

06:50.493 --> 06:51.452
UGH.

06:51.494 --> 06:52.662
TAKE A GOOD, HARD LOOK,

06:52.704 --> 06:54.331

07:00.503 --> 07:01.462

07:27.364 --> 07:30.158
HOW THEIR LIP LINER BLEEDS

07:27.364 --> 07:30.158

12:08.478 --> 12:10.813
ANGELA BASSETT PLAYED

12:08.478 --> 12:10.813

IN THE BUILDING HATES US,

12:37.840 --> 12:40.176
THE LANDLORD REFUSES

12:37.840 --> 12:40.176
TO FIX IT.

12:40.218 --> 12:42.220
I LIKE TO KEEP CRACKERS

12:40.218 --> 12:42.220
NEXT TO MY BED

12:42.262 --> 12:43.804
JUST IN CASE I WAKE UP QUEASY.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.816
I KNOW. BUT I JUST HAD

12:53.856 --> 12:55.816
A SEX DREAM ABOUT HIM.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.652

12:57.694 --> 13:00.863
WELL, I MEAN, I-I GUESS--

12:57.694 --> 13:00.863
I GUESS THAT COULD WORK.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.532
I MEAN, HE MEETS

13:00.905 --> 13:02.532
ALL THE CRITERIA.

13:02.574 --> 13:04.701
HE'S CUTE, HE'S KIND,

13:02.574 --> 13:04.701
HE HAS A JOB.

13:04.743 --> 13:07.287
I KNOW. DON'T EAT THAT.

13:04.743 --> 13:07.287
PIGEONS WALKED ON THAT.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.830
HE'S GREAT, RIGHT?

13:07.328 --> 13:09.830
YOU DID IT.

13:09.872 --> 13:10.831
NO, WE DID IT.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.292
WE DID IT. YAY!

13:10.873 --> 13:12.292
YAY!

13:12.333 --> 13:14.835
WELL, I'M GONNA GO TAKE HIM

13:12.333 --> 13:14.835
DOWN TO POUND TOWN. AH!

13:14.877 --> 13:16.755
NO! BABY STEPS.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.755
(hums)

13:16.795 --> 13:17.838
NO!

13:21.884 --> 13:23.344
OKAY, SO WE HAVE

13:21.884 --> 13:23.344
TO TREAD CAREFULLY

13:23.386 --> 13:25.846
BECAUSE MARK'S MY BOSS

13:23.386 --> 13:25.846
AND YOU'RE MY ROOMMATE,

13:25.888 --> 13:27.098
AND THINGS COULD GET

13:25.888 --> 13:27.098
A LITTLE MESSY.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.058
RIGHT. BUT JUST FOR YOU,

13:27.140 --> 13:29.058
SO IT'S OKAY.

13:29.100 --> 13:32.353
OKAY, CHLOE,

13:29.100 --> 13:32.353
ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.897
LUTHER IS NOT WORKING OUT

13:32.395 --> 13:34.897
AS MY WINGMAN.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.775
♪♪♪

13:36.815 --> 13:38.901
HEY, GIRL.

13:38.943 --> 13:41.028
YOU LIKE MY FRIEND

13:38.943 --> 13:41.028

13:41.070 --> 13:42.863
JAMES VAN DER BEEK.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.866

13:42.905 --> 13:45.866
HE LIKES YOU, TOO.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.494
(normal voice) BUT I DON'T.

13:47.535 --> 13:50.580
HE IS A GUEST JUDGE ON

13:47.535 --> 13:50.580
"PROJECT RUNWAY" IN THE MORNING.

13:50.622 --> 13:53.874
HE NEEDS HIS BEAUTY SLEEP OR HIS

13:50.622 --> 13:53.874
FACE WILL BE BIG AS A PLATE.

13:53.916 --> 13:59.798
SO GET YOUR PURSE

13:53.916 --> 13:59.798
AND CLICK-CLACK ON OUT OF HERE.

13:59.838 --> 14:01.882
CLICK-CLACK. CLICK-CLACK.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.884
(slurps)

14:03.926 --> 14:05.094
(mouths words)

14:05.136 --> 14:07.888
(mouths words)

14:07.930 --> 14:10.725
SORRY, JAMES,

14:07.930 --> 14:10.725
CHLOE HAS CHANGED.

14:10.767 --> 14:14.145
SHE FINALLY LIKES

14:10.767 --> 14:14.145
AN APPROPRIATE GUY.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.939
MARK, THE GUY WITH THE BIG HAIR

14:14.187 --> 14:16.939
FROM JUNE'S WORK.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.817
NO WAY.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.817
I DON'T BUY IT.

14:18.857 --> 14:20.485
IF SHE LIKES HIM, THERE'S GOTTA

14:18.857 --> 14:20.485
BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM.

14:20.527 --> 14:21.944
WE JUST DON'T KNOW

14:20.527 --> 14:21.944
WHAT IT IS YET.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.904
SHE ONLY LIKES

14:21.986 --> 14:23.904
INAPPROPRIATE GUYS.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.323
NOT ANYMORE.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.907
AND WE'RE GOING

14:25.365 --> 14:26.907
TO SEE MARK NOW

14:26.949 --> 14:28.618
AND CHLOE IS GOING

14:26.949 --> 14:28.618
TO INTERACT WITH HIM

14:28.660 --> 14:30.829
IN A POLITE

14:28.660 --> 14:30.829
AND NONSEXUAL MANNER.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.455
WHATEVER THAT MEANS!

14:34.833 --> 14:35.958
(door bells jingle)

14:36.000 --> 14:37.794
HI THERE.

14:37.836 --> 14:38.919
YOU MUST BE MARK.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.547
I'M CHLOE. NICE TO MEET YOU.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.549
(muffled) YEAH, WE'VE MET,

14:40.588 --> 14:42.549
LIKE, 30 TIMES.

14:42.590 --> 14:43.299
(giggles)

14:43.341 --> 14:45.385
YES. (laughs loudly)

14:45.426 --> 14:48.304
SO, MARK,

14:45.426 --> 14:48.304
YOU SECRETLY MARRIED? KIDS?

14:48.346 --> 14:49.930
YOU EVER KILL A MAN

14:48.346 --> 14:49.930
OUTSIDE OF COMBAT?

14:49.972 --> 14:51.932
JAMES, NOT NOW.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.932
I'M IN A CRISIS, OKAY?

14:51.974 --> 14:54.853
MY FRIEND MARTIN AND HIS WIFE

14:51.974 --> 14:54.853
JUST CANCELED ON ME FOR BRUNCH.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.187
NOW I'M DOWN TO FOUR PEOPLE.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.605
I MEAN, THAT'S NOT BRUNCH.

14:57.647 --> 14:58.939
THAT'S BARELY

14:57.647 --> 14:58.939
A CASUAL BREAKFAST.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.734
IT'S A WASTE

14:58.981 --> 15:00.734
OF EVERYONE'S TIME.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.943
OOH! MARK, CHLOE CAN COME.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.445
YEAH, I'LL COME, TOO.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.947
I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING

15:04.487 --> 15:06.947
YOUR GAY LOVER WHOSE NAME IS...

15:06.989 --> 15:08.825
ALL RIGHT.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.825
UH, BACK UP TO SIX!

15:08.867 --> 15:11.952
(laughs) CAN'T KEEP BRUNCH

15:08.867 --> 15:11.952
DOWN FOR LONG. BRUNCH!

15:11.994 --> 15:14.622
(June and Chloe laugh)

15:14.664 --> 15:15.707
(whispers) CHLOE.

15:15.749 --> 15:16.957
(normal voice) CHLOE,

15:15.749 --> 15:16.957
THIS IS PERFECT.

15:16.999 --> 15:20.754
YOU CAN TELL MARK YOU LIKE HIM

15:16.999 --> 15:20.754
AT A DAYTIME CHAPERONED MEAL.

15:20.795 --> 15:24.215
OH, GOD. THIS IS SUCH HARD WORK.

15:20.795 --> 15:24.215
WHEN DOES THE FUN START?

15:24.257 --> 15:26.967
WHEN YOU GET A RING

15:24.257 --> 15:26.967
ON YOUR FINGER, MISS THING.

15:27.009 --> 15:28.928
WHAT?

15:27.009 --> 15:28.928
I SWUNG TOO FAR.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.642
WELCOME, BRUNCHERS.

15:34.684 --> 15:38.646
COME ON IN. OKAY, WE GOT KYLE

15:34.684 --> 15:38.646
AT THE JUICE STATION,

15:38.688 --> 15:40.981
THAT'S TIM WATCHING FOOTBALL

15:38.688 --> 15:40.981
ON MUTE

15:41.023 --> 15:42.859
WHILE HE'S LISTENING TO JAZZ.

15:42.901 --> 15:45.236
THE AUDIO DOESN'T EVEN MATCH

15:42.901 --> 15:45.236
THE VISUAL AND IT'S OKAY.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.822
IT'S BRUNCH! (chuckles)

15:47.864 --> 15:49.990
HEY. WE'RE NOT LATE, ARE WE?

15:50.032 --> 15:51.033
"WE"?

15:51.075 --> 15:52.076
YEAH, I JUST WENT

15:52.118 --> 15:54.454
AND PICKED UP ANTHONY

15:52.118 --> 15:54.454
FROM KARATE CLASS.

15:54.495 --> 15:55.580
OH, OKAY.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.998
IT'S, UH, SUPPOSED TO BE

15:55.622 --> 15:57.998
BRUNCH FOR JUST SIX,

15:58.040 --> 16:00.293
BUT SURE. WHATEVER.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.293
YOU'RE FAMOUS.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.629
CHLOE, YOU REMEMBER ANTHONY,

16:00.334 --> 16:02.629
RIGHT?

16:02.670 --> 16:05.882
LOOK AT HIM ALL SWEATY

16:02.670 --> 16:05.882
IN HIS KARATE GI.

16:05.924 --> 16:07.842
SMOOTH AND HAIRLESS.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.886
(slurps)

16:09.928 --> 16:14.181
AH! YOU KNOW, I FINISHED EVERY

16:09.928 --> 16:14.181
WII GAME I'VE EVER STARTED.

16:14.223 --> 16:17.351
YELLOW BELT, HUH? WEAK.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.522
(Mark and Chloe laugh)

16:21.564 --> 16:23.942
SO I REALIZED THE OLD WOMAN

16:21.564 --> 16:23.942
I'D BEEN PARTYING WITH ALL NIGHT

16:23.983 --> 16:25.025
WAS REALLY PAUL McCARTNEY.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.027
(laughs) SO DID YOU TELL HIM

16:27.069 --> 16:28.404
THE GREEN BEANS HAD BEEN

16:27.069 --> 16:28.404
IN YOUR PURSE?

16:28.446 --> 16:30.323
OF COURSE NOT.

16:28.446 --> 16:30.323
MY SKIRT WAS ALREADY RIPPED.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.032
YOU KNOW,

16:30.364 --> 16:32.032
ANTHONY LIKES THE BEATLES.

16:32.074 --> 16:34.243
HE CAN SING

16:32.074 --> 16:34.243
"NORWEGIAN WOOD."

16:34.285 --> 16:36.203
HOW COME EVERYONE ELSE

16:34.285 --> 16:36.203
HAS REAL SILVERWARE?

16:36.245 --> 16:39.624
'CAUSE I HAD

16:36.245 --> 16:39.624
PLACE SETTINGS...

16:39.666 --> 16:41.459
FOR  SIX...

16:41.501 --> 16:43.837
ANTHONY.

16:43.878 --> 16:45.839
(whispering) TIME TO LET HIM

16:43.878 --> 16:45.839
KNOW THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.298
TELL HIM YOU WANT

16:45.880 --> 16:47.298
TO SEE HIS APARTMENT

16:47.340 --> 16:49.049
AND GET SOME ONE-ON-ONE TIME.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.134
OKAY.

16:50.176 --> 16:53.721
SO, MARK, THIS IS

16:50.176 --> 16:53.721
A REALLY NICE ROOM.

16:53.763 --> 16:56.516
ARE THERE ANY OTHER NICE ROOMS

16:53.763 --> 16:56.516
THAT I COULD SEE?

16:56.557 --> 16:59.477
YEAH, SURE. UM, THE EGGS ARE

16:56.557 --> 16:59.477
IN THE WARMING TRAY,

16:59.519 --> 17:03.314
THE GRAPEFRUIT'S BEEN SUGARED.

16:59.519 --> 17:03.314
LET'S DO IT.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.277
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

17:08.319 --> 17:12.072
HOT 17-YEAR-OLD DUDE IN A GI.

17:08.319 --> 17:12.072
NOTHING.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.741
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS, JUNE.

17:13.783 --> 17:15.075
I'VE LOST HER.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.118
HMM.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.954
CAN I HAVE ANOTHER JUICE?

17:17.996 --> 17:20.080
NO. YOU'VE HAD THREE ALREADY.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.082
SO THIS IS ME IN HIGH SCHOOL,

17:22.124 --> 17:25.085
AND THAT IS

17:22.124 --> 17:25.085
ACTUALLY THIS SHIRT.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.547
ARE THOSE CRACKERS?

17:27.588 --> 17:29.757
YEAH, I KEEP THEM THERE

17:27.588 --> 17:29.757
IN CASE I GET QUEASY.

17:29.799 --> 17:32.010
IT WAS JUNE'S IDEA.

17:29.799 --> 17:32.010
SHE'S REALLY SMART.

17:32.051 --> 17:36.180
SEE, I HAVE THESE WEIRD DREAMS

17:32.051 --> 17:36.180
WHERE I'M ON A ROLLER COASTER...

17:36.222 --> 17:38.725
I LIKE JUNE.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.725
I  REALLY  LIKE JUNE.

17:38.766 --> 17:41.019
I DON'T KNOW IT YET,

17:38.766 --> 17:41.019
BUT I LIKE JUNE.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.312
WE'RE FRIENDS AND JUNE PROBABLY

17:41.060 --> 17:43.312
DOESN'T LIKE ME,

17:43.354 --> 17:45.147
SO THAT'S WHAT'S KEEPING ME

17:43.354 --> 17:45.147
FROM SEEING IT.

17:45.189 --> 17:47.107
BUT YEAH, JUNE.

17:47.149 --> 17:50.528
OHH.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.780
THAT'S WHY I WAS

17:50.570 --> 17:52.780
ATTRACTED TO YOU.

17:52.822 --> 17:55.115
WHAT?

17:52.822 --> 17:55.115
YOU'RE

17:52.822 --> 17:55.115
EMOTIONALLY UNAVAILABLE.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.535
YOU  ARE

17:55.157 --> 17:57.535
AN INAPPROPRIATE GUY.

17:57.577 --> 17:58.202
UH...

17:58.244 --> 17:59.996
BUT JUST BECAUSE

18:00.038 --> 18:03.165
I HAVE A DEEP URGE TO SLEEP

18:00.038 --> 18:03.165
WITH YOU DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE TO.

18:03.207 --> 18:06.126
NOPE. I'M WALKING AWAY.

18:06.168 --> 18:09.422
I GUESS I HAVE CHANGED.

18:06.168 --> 18:09.422
(giggles)

18:13.384 --> 18:15.553
(sighs) SOMETIMES

18:13.384 --> 18:15.553
YOU THROW BRUNCH,

18:15.595 --> 18:19.139
AND SOMETIMES BRUNCH THROWS YOU.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.141
OH, JAMES.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.560
STOP POUTING.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.854
YOU'RE JUST UPSET BECAUSE

18:22.602 --> 18:24.854
YOU LOST YOUR WINGMAN,

18:24.896 --> 18:28.148
BUT THIS IS GONNA BE BETTER

18:24.896 --> 18:28.148
FOR CHLOE.

18:28.190 --> 18:31.151
BETTER FOR CHLOE

18:28.190 --> 18:31.151
OR FOR YOU?

18:31.193 --> 18:32.570
YOU JUST DON'T WANT

18:31.193 --> 18:32.570
YOUR NEIGHBORS

18:32.612 --> 18:34.154
TO THINK YOU'RE A SLUT.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.154
WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH ANYWAY?

18:34.196 --> 18:37.157
DO YOU EVEN LIKE THEM?

18:37.199 --> 18:38.158
NO.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.036
BUT YOU LIKE CHLOE?

18:38.200 --> 18:40.036
YEAH.

18:40.078 --> 18:41.996
YEAH, 'CAUSE SHE'S SPONTANEOUS

18:40.078 --> 18:41.996
AND CHARMING.

18:42.038 --> 18:43.247
AND FUN AND UNPREDICTABLE.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.041
SO WHY ARE YOU TRYING

18:43.289 --> 18:45.041
TO CHANGE HER?

18:46.208 --> 18:49.420
(cell phone alert chimes)

18:51.672 --> 18:54.174
(sighs)

18:54.216 --> 18:55.635
I SHOULD'VE BOUGHT

18:54.216 --> 18:55.635
MORE CROISSANTS.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.177
I MEAN, I STOOD THERE

18:55.676 --> 18:57.177
AT THE GROCERY STORE,

18:57.219 --> 19:00.180
I HAD THEM IN MY HAND,

18:57.219 --> 19:00.180
AND I CHOKED.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.808
I CHOKED.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.183
WAIT.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.727
IF MARK IS HERE, THEN WHO--

19:07.229 --> 19:09.231
ANTHONY, NO!

19:09.273 --> 19:10.232
WHO ARE YOU, MY MA?

19:10.274 --> 19:13.611
OH, THANK GOD.

19:13.653 --> 19:17.197
WAIT. THEN WHO'S IN THERE?

19:17.239 --> 19:19.033
'SUP, CHICKENS?

19:20.493 --> 19:22.996
ARIGATO.  HEY!

19:23.037 --> 19:26.206
YES! SEX WITH A STRANGER

19:23.037 --> 19:26.206
IN ANOTHER DUDE'S BEDROOM!

19:26.248 --> 19:28.709
WELCOME BACK!

19:26.248 --> 19:28.709
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

19:28.751 --> 19:31.211
I COULDN'T DO IT.

19:28.751 --> 19:31.211
I COULDN'T MARRY A FARMER.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.212
(laughs)

19:32.254 --> 19:33.631
WHERE ARE MY EGGS?

19:33.673 --> 19:35.257
WHAT'S GO--WHO WAS THAT?

19:35.299 --> 19:38.011

19:35.299 --> 19:38.011
THIS BRUNCH MADE ME REALIZE

19:38.052 --> 19:39.637
THAT I STILL LIKE

19:38.052 --> 19:39.637
INAPPROPRIATE GUYS.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.140
SO IT'S NOT GONNA WORK OUT

19:39.679 --> 19:42.140
WITH MARK. I HOPE IT'S OKAY.

19:42.181 --> 19:45.434
IT IS OKAY. I AM SO SORRY

19:42.181 --> 19:45.434
FOR TRYING TO CHANGE YOU

19:45.476 --> 19:47.478
AND MAKE YOU INTO SOMETHING

19:45.476 --> 19:47.478
THAT YOU'RE NOT.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.438
OH, MY GOD.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.438
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

19:49.480 --> 19:53.067
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU.

19:49.480 --> 19:53.067
LOVE YOU 1,000%.

19:53.109 --> 19:54.234
OKAY. BYE-BYE.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.236
(beep)

19:56.278 --> 19:57.237
GUESS WHAT.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.865
JENNIFER AND I ARE

19:57.279 --> 19:58.865

19:58.906 --> 20:02.242
LET HER CHANGE YOU.

20:02.284 --> 20:04.162

20:04.203 --> 20:06.246
OKAY, EVERYBODY OUT.

20:06.288 --> 20:09.083
I NEED TO SHAVE

20:06.288 --> 20:09.083

20:09.125 --> 20:11.335

20:09.125 --> 20:11.335
IF WE CAN SQUEEZE IN A HIKE.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.253
CATS CAN'T WALK THEMSELVES.

20:13.295 --> 20:16.256
SO LET'S GO, BRUCE LEE.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.842

20:17.884 --> 20:19.259
I GUESS IT'S FOR THE BEST

20:19.301 --> 20:21.179
THAT IT DIDN'T WORK OUT

20:19.301 --> 20:21.179
WITH YOU AND MARK.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.262
IT JUST WASN'T MEANT TO BE.

20:22.304 --> 20:23.263

20:39.155 --> 20:43.242
ALL SYSTEMS ARE GO ♪

20:48.539 --> 20:50.290
(indistinct conversations)

20:50.332 --> 20:52.292

20:52.334 --> 20:53.293
MY WINGMAN IS BACK.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.685
