WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:03.937
-(stomps)
-(fingers snapping rhythmically)

00:06.040 --> 00:09.343
ANNOUNCER: Better Things.
All new Thursdays at 10:00
on FX.

00:13.247 --> 00:16.350
FXX presents You're the Worst.

00:17.685 --> 00:20.654
(bicycle bells dinging)

00:20.688 --> 00:22.656
(man singing opera)

00:22.690 --> 00:26.194
(children giggling)

00:26.227 --> 00:29.897
When I saw the images from the
Eagle Nebula, my God, Leonard.

00:29.930 --> 00:32.333
Swirling, almost pulsating

00:32.366 --> 00:34.768
elephant trunks of dust and gas

00:34.802 --> 00:37.037
700 light-years away. Oh.

00:37.071 --> 00:39.440
Ah, the Pillars of Creation.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.709
Spitzer observed a cloud of

00:41.742 --> 00:44.678
supernova shock waves,
suggesting the pillars

00:44.712 --> 00:47.881
Hubble had just photographed
may have actually been destroyed

00:47.915 --> 00:49.883
6,000 years ago.

00:49.917 --> 00:52.553
Oh, what better captures

00:52.586 --> 00:56.090
both the pathetic insignificance
of humanity

00:56.124 --> 00:59.460
and our own tragic nobility

00:59.493 --> 01:02.062
than to fall in love
with the ghost of something

01:02.096 --> 01:04.064
we had no chance

01:04.098 --> 01:06.434
of ever knowing
in the first place.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.436
(doorbell plays 2001's
"Also Sprach Zarathustra" theme)

01:08.469 --> 01:10.838
Ah.

01:16.244 --> 01:18.146
What up, space nerds?

01:18.179 --> 01:20.948
You must be Paul's family.
Welcome.

01:20.981 --> 01:22.916
-(chuckles)
-Oh. Thank you.

01:22.950 --> 01:24.452
Okay!

01:24.485 --> 01:26.954
Paul forgot to mention
how ravishing you are.

01:26.987 --> 01:29.089
-Oh, well, thank you.
-(door slams)

01:29.123 --> 01:32.760
And... Vernon. Paul described
you pretty accurately.

01:32.793 --> 01:35.929
-Thanks.
-(clears throat)
Uh, I'm Leonard Gilmartin,

01:35.963 --> 01:38.499
but please, call me Gilly.
Everyone does.

01:38.532 --> 01:41.602
-Oh.
-Copy that, Gillbo.
-Just Gilly.

01:41.635 --> 01:44.572
I'm the president of
the Pasadena Astronomy Society.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.674
I won an auction
on Eeebs for these.

01:46.707 --> 01:49.076
Hundred bones for a set of four.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.611
Bit pricey, but as a surgeon,

01:50.644 --> 01:53.514
I know how important it is
to be able to see good.

01:53.547 --> 01:56.817
Oh, fabulous. Of course,
you know it's a lunar eclipse.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.522
Agree to disagree.

02:01.555 --> 02:02.956
(Becca softly chuckles)

02:02.990 --> 02:05.493
-Oh, joy! You made it!
-Oh, good.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.795
I'll let you show them
to their room. (chuckles)

02:07.828 --> 02:11.299
Wow, Paul,
this place is trés classy.

02:11.332 --> 02:14.302
Yeah, it's like we're getting
to crash at a Pier 1 Imports,

02:14.335 --> 02:17.471
or something not quite as fancy,
but still good, like a CB2.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.807
I'm so glad you guys came!

02:19.840 --> 02:22.343
I look forward to
the once-a-year family weekend

02:22.376 --> 02:24.878
here at Gilly's
more than just about anything.

02:24.912 --> 02:27.181
Aside from the McRib.

02:27.215 --> 02:30.651
What is it about that sandwich
that haunts me so?

02:30.684 --> 02:32.686
Where's Tallulah?

02:32.720 --> 02:35.022
Becca asked Lindsay to watch her
while we were away.

02:35.055 --> 02:36.857
You said
you were gonna ask her.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.859
Oh. Right.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.894
-I did... and she said yes.
-Huh.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.496
-So, that's all set.
-Ah.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.832
I got to shoot off a text
real quick, unrelated.

02:44.865 --> 02:48.068
-Follow me to your quarters.
-(Becca chuckles)

02:58.412 --> 03:01.549
* I'm gonna leave you anyway *

03:01.582 --> 03:03.684
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

03:03.717 --> 03:06.053
* Gonna leave you anyway. *

03:12.393 --> 03:14.695
-(gentle piano music playing)
-(Becca gasps)

03:17.197 --> 03:19.166
Ah!

03:19.199 --> 03:22.336
Blankets and pillows.
Ka-ching!

03:22.370 --> 03:25.673
And I'm right next door.
We share a bathroom.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.275
Gross.

03:27.308 --> 03:30.177
I'll let you two settle in.

03:30.210 --> 03:33.581
I'm supposed to help some of the
little ones make a moon cake.

03:33.614 --> 03:38.552
It's actually a sponge cake
with powdered sugar. Shh.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.187
(Becca sighs)

03:40.220 --> 03:42.022
We play our cards right, Bec,

03:42.055 --> 03:44.758
I think we can milk this con
into a European vacay.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.860
Ew.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.129
Paul probably wants us
to do the insemination

03:49.162 --> 03:51.465
during the eclipse,
like a freaky.

03:51.499 --> 03:54.568
-For sure.
What a dingus. (gasps)
-Ugh.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.704
I bet I can make
my own sandwich here.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.939
Like, they'll probably have one
of those fancy sandwich bars

03:58.972 --> 04:01.208
with all the fixins.
Can you imagine, Bec?

04:01.241 --> 04:03.977
(chuckles)
Me with fixins?

04:05.446 --> 04:07.648
I can't even picture it.

04:18.659 --> 04:21.962
Come on, sport with us.
Tallyho!

04:24.264 --> 04:26.434
BECCA:
Get it, honey.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.168
That's out.

04:28.201 --> 04:30.270
-(cheering, laughing)
-Yeah! Nice serve, buddy!

04:30.304 --> 04:32.940
Oh, honey.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.743
-(bicycle bells dinging)
-(Becca whoops)

04:35.776 --> 04:37.311
Come and get me, Vern.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.548
VERNON:
Oh! Shitballs.

04:59.567 --> 05:02.002
-Did you feel it?
-I did.

05:02.035 --> 05:04.037
(indistinct chatter)

05:10.711 --> 05:13.113
Fixins.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.683
(playing classical music)

05:34.902 --> 05:38.406
I just want to address something
so that there isn't any

05:38.439 --> 05:42.376
dark cumulonimbus sullying
this weekend.

05:42.410 --> 05:46.847
I've been doing some
soul-searching, and I think

05:46.880 --> 05:48.916
we should press pause
on the insemination protocol.

05:50.551 --> 05:53.020
But we're making progress.

05:53.053 --> 05:56.690
I-I feel us getting closer
with every attempt.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.759
Come on,
let's give it one more shot

05:58.792 --> 06:01.328
when the moon eats the sun
or whatever the frig.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.031
The truth is, our primitive
insemination technique,

06:04.064 --> 06:05.899
combined with Rebecca's

06:05.933 --> 06:09.336
geriatric womb, has me
convinced success is improbable.

06:09.369 --> 06:12.239
Did you just call my womb
geriatric?!

06:12.272 --> 06:14.675
-Primitive technique?
-Sometimes,

06:14.708 --> 06:17.310
it's just harder
for women of your advanced age.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.716
We faked it!

06:22.750 --> 06:24.952
-What do you mean?
-Nothing! She doesn't
mean anything.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.588
I think her geriatric womb
has spread to her brain.

06:27.621 --> 06:30.223
We've never put any
of your semen into my vagina.

06:30.257 --> 06:31.859
We've only been pretending
in order

06:31.892 --> 06:33.961
to string you along
and make more money.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.964
My womb works. It works
like gangbusters, mister.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.766
What did you do with my...?

06:38.799 --> 06:41.535
Your gunk?
I squirted it out the window.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.136
But if it makes you feel
any better,

06:43.170 --> 06:45.205
the ficus in Lindsay's alley
has grown, like, a foot.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.207
BECCA:
This time, we'll actually do it.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.043
And we'll bake you up
a bouncing baby in no time.

06:50.077 --> 06:53.947
Come on. There were mistakes
made on both sides.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.983
On both sides.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.989
Now that the the cold,
hard truth is coming out...

07:02.022 --> 07:04.458
I've already lined up
another surrogate.

07:04.492 --> 07:05.993
She's 24,

07:06.026 --> 07:09.129
is getting her master's,
and was a Division 1

07:09.162 --> 07:11.398
fencing champion.
And the best part?

07:11.431 --> 07:15.102
She's not a no-good,
rotten liar!

07:15.135 --> 07:16.970
You're cheating on us?
Dude...

07:17.004 --> 07:19.507
this is a lot to take in
right now. We trusted you!

07:19.540 --> 07:21.642
Calling all stargazers!

07:21.675 --> 07:24.645
Lunch is ready!

07:24.678 --> 07:26.514
(indistinct chatter)

07:26.547 --> 07:28.816
This is a pleasure for me
to be with all of you.

07:28.849 --> 07:31.852
(indistinct chatter continues)

07:37.024 --> 07:40.160
GILMARTIN: Oh, well,
you're in for it now.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.763
Let's eat, everybody.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.365
Enjoy the cheese, it's imported.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.375
The Mayans believed that

07:55.408 --> 07:58.011
during an eclipse, jaguars would
come out of the earth

07:58.045 --> 08:01.348
and eat the pale people,
pale people like you.

08:01.381 --> 08:04.518
At least my little dick's not
hanging out of my shorts.

08:04.552 --> 08:05.886
Ha! Stupid.

08:05.919 --> 08:08.221
(laughs)

08:08.255 --> 08:09.523
Mmm.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.163
(fire crackling)

08:24.171 --> 08:27.207
I'm actually glad you found
that 24-year-old.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.877
She sounds great.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.345
Just... be careful, though.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.682
It can be complicated
for a woman,

08:34.715 --> 08:37.685
especially a young one
without children.

08:37.718 --> 08:40.253
Once you see that baby...
(sighs)

08:40.287 --> 08:42.956
it's hard not to be attached.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.927
I see what you're trying to do.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.398
Our trust has been
irrevocably shattered, Becca.

08:51.431 --> 08:53.667
It's over.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.669
I know we betrayed you,

08:55.703 --> 08:58.772
but when it came down to it,
that has never really seemed

08:58.806 --> 09:01.041
like the right way
to create a life--

09:01.074 --> 09:03.543
the bathroom, the cold baster.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.245
Vernon.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.447
I mean...

09:07.480 --> 09:11.318
what if we eliminated
the intermediary device?

09:19.459 --> 09:21.795
Are you suggesting
that you and I...?

09:21.829 --> 09:23.463
Yes.

09:23.496 --> 09:25.599
I am.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.868
Give us that come, bro!
We'll do it for real this time!

09:27.901 --> 09:31.438
-We promise!
-What is wrong with you two?

09:31.471 --> 09:34.407
She offers to have sex with me,
then you try to intimidate me?

09:34.441 --> 09:36.710
I don't know what type
of reindeer games

09:36.744 --> 09:39.947
you're playing,
but I don't want to join in.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.949
Not in any of them!

09:44.017 --> 09:46.219
Great job, turd.

09:46.253 --> 09:49.156
I was this close to getting
our fish back on the line.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.458
-By offering him your bod?
-You got greedy,

09:51.491 --> 09:54.561
and now our golden goose thinks
my eggs have expired!

09:54.594 --> 09:56.129
Don't blame this on me.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.265
You were enjoying the scam
just as much as I was.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.733
You said you felt like
Annette Bening

09:59.767 --> 10:00.801
-in The Grifters.
-You're the one

10:00.834 --> 10:02.602
that blew up our lives
and put us

10:02.636 --> 10:04.104
in this situation
in the first place!

10:04.137 --> 10:05.572
You didn't just nick an artery.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.475
You nicked any chance
of us being happy again.

10:08.508 --> 10:12.012
You were always a bitch,
but you just got mean, Bec.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.247
Why'd you even marry me
in the first place?

10:14.281 --> 10:16.116
I could be married to Téa Leoni!

10:16.149 --> 10:19.987
You were in line with her
at Jamba Juice! One time!

10:20.020 --> 10:21.989
We shared a moment!
She said, "Cool jacket."

10:22.022 --> 10:23.857
Who knows where
it could have gone.

10:23.891 --> 10:26.126
But instead, I ended up
with a blackhearted witch

10:26.159 --> 10:27.961
who wants nothing to do with me!

10:27.995 --> 10:29.763
I only married you
because you were a doctor

10:29.797 --> 10:31.164
and I wanted
to make Jimmy jealous.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.700
But you even ruined that

10:32.733 --> 10:36.536
by becoming a giant,
worthless zero!

10:57.224 --> 10:58.759
(exhales)

11:02.262 --> 11:03.530
What?

11:03.563 --> 11:05.132
Do you want to play
a game with me?

11:05.165 --> 11:08.836
Yeah, okay, but no pussin' out
when I stomp you.

11:08.869 --> 11:11.171
I'm an adult grown-up.
That means some shit.

11:15.575 --> 11:17.310
This game?

11:17.344 --> 11:19.379
-Are you even
for real right now?
-Mm-hmm.

11:19.412 --> 11:21.414
(chuckles)
Look at you.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.683
You're just a chill little dude
who hasn't been kicked

11:23.717 --> 11:25.352
in the nards by life yet.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.987
But you will.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.989
One day when you're
least expecting it-- blam!

11:29.022 --> 11:30.858
One second you're the envy
of all the other docs,

11:30.891 --> 11:34.862
'cause you got a hot wife,
vanity plates, two Apple watches

11:34.895 --> 11:37.330
and a podcast in the top
three hundy on Stitcher.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.666
And the next thing you know,
everything's taken away

11:39.699 --> 11:42.602
because your scalpel
accidentally sliced open

11:42.635 --> 11:44.004
-a woman's...
-(gasps)

11:44.037 --> 11:45.172
...juice box.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.573
So you quit. End of story.

11:46.606 --> 11:47.640
Deal the things.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.612
Ooh, I got "chip on shoulder."

11:55.282 --> 11:56.583
(giggles)

11:57.617 --> 11:58.952
"Brain freeze."

11:58.986 --> 12:00.520
No prob.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.123
-(buzzes)
-Damn it!

12:03.156 --> 12:05.959
-My turn.
-That's not... Come on, let me
get these brain shits out.

12:05.993 --> 12:08.728
-But it buzzed.
-The shit's rigged!

12:08.762 --> 12:10.563
Let me go again!
You're being awful!

12:10.597 --> 12:13.300
-But it's my turn! No!
-Getting the brains!
I'm getting the brains.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.602
-But it's my turn!
-I'm getting the brains.
I am a grown-up!

12:18.839 --> 12:20.841
("Nocturne in E-flat Major"
by Frédéric Chopin playing)

12:25.512 --> 12:27.414
-(clears throat)
-(children laughing)

12:40.460 --> 12:42.129
Oops.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.264
If you already have
that 24-year-old lined up,

12:44.297 --> 12:46.633
why'd you ask us
to come for the weekend?

12:48.001 --> 12:49.803
You were the only people

12:49.837 --> 12:52.305
I wanted to share
this weekend with.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.174
I thought we were family.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.277
I'm sorry, Paul.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.180
(sighs)

13:00.213 --> 13:02.115
Here.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.716
Let me recalibrate it for you.

13:06.954 --> 13:09.256
You know, at the end of the day,

13:09.289 --> 13:10.757
it's probably for the best.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.826
I mean, if I had your baby,

13:12.860 --> 13:15.128
we'd probably end up
on Jerry Springer.

13:15.162 --> 13:18.832
"Woman pregnant with
sister's ex-husband's child."

13:18.866 --> 13:21.468
Also, you divorced Lindsay
for a reason--

13:21.501 --> 13:24.504
not to then have her
in your life forever.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.942
You're right.

13:28.976 --> 13:31.378
This probably is for the best.

13:38.485 --> 13:39.987
(buzzes)

13:40.020 --> 13:42.822
(panting)

13:43.891 --> 13:45.325

13:45.358 --> 13:47.060
(monitor beeping)

13:50.864 --> 13:52.065
(buzzes)

13:52.099 --> 13:54.567
NURSE:
Doctor! What did you do?

13:54.601 --> 13:56.036
(buzzing)

13:56.069 --> 13:58.371
We're losing her!

13:58.405 --> 13:59.839
Doctor!

13:59.873 --> 14:02.175
Dr. Barbara! Dear God!

14:02.209 --> 14:05.578
BECCA: Giant, worthless zero!
I wish I'd never married you.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.047
...just to make Jimmy jealous.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.748
TEA LEONI (echoing):
Hey, cool jacket.

14:08.781 --> 14:10.217
I'm Téa Leoni.
I'm Téa Leoni.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.851
Cool jacket.

14:11.885 --> 14:14.387
So sexy.

14:14.421 --> 14:17.157
(monitor flatlining)

14:17.190 --> 14:18.825
Is that really Mercury?

14:18.858 --> 14:21.261
Believe it or not, it's
actually one of the few planets

14:21.294 --> 14:23.363
that's easier to see
in daylight.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.732
Want to see
the stunning siren herself,

14:25.765 --> 14:27.400
Venus?

14:29.602 --> 14:32.405
There she is.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.407
Let me see. I want to see.

14:34.441 --> 14:37.210
-(laughs)
-Here.

14:37.244 --> 14:39.246
Amazing.

14:40.813 --> 14:44.251
You have the same
anti-helical folds as Lindsay.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.419
How would you know that?

14:46.453 --> 14:48.555
(laughs)
No. It's your ears.

14:48.588 --> 14:51.058
-Oh.
-Right here.

14:51.091 --> 14:52.559
(Becca clears throat)

14:52.592 --> 14:54.962
Let me show you
its terrestrial functions.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.363
-Hmm.
-We actually have
a fighting chance

14:56.396 --> 14:58.065
of seeing your house from here.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.567
I mean... former house.

15:05.805 --> 15:06.806
(gasps)

15:11.644 --> 15:13.947
I think I just saw...

15:13.981 --> 15:15.448
I got to go.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.685
(Becca scoffs)

15:19.686 --> 15:21.821
(panting)
Vernon!

15:21.854 --> 15:22.822
Nerd!

15:22.855 --> 15:24.624
Good Lord! What did you do?

15:24.657 --> 15:25.925
I threw this heavy-ass rock in,

15:25.959 --> 15:27.894
but then changed my mind
at the last sec,

15:27.927 --> 15:30.930
so now I'm doing this,
which sucks! Help me!

15:32.699 --> 15:34.501
(both straining)

15:34.534 --> 15:38.138
If I don't make it,
I need you to do me a favor.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.606
You're gonna make it.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.608
Listen, it's
for Becca and Tallulah.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.177
I want them to know
I was a good man.

15:44.211 --> 15:46.179
-(straining)
-Which is why I need you

15:46.213 --> 15:48.848
to delete my browser history
and all my bookmarks

15:48.881 --> 15:50.317
and my Dropbox,

15:50.350 --> 15:52.119
-maybe burn the laptop.
-Huh?

15:52.152 --> 15:55.989
Please, Paul! First thing,
maybe even before you call 911.

15:56.023 --> 15:57.090
Pull harder!

15:57.124 --> 15:59.426
(both straining)

15:59.459 --> 16:00.660
Okay.

16:07.034 --> 16:08.968
(both grunting)

16:13.040 --> 16:16.543
-Ah.
-Thanks for saving my life.

16:16.576 --> 16:19.612
Fam.
(chuckles wearily)

16:19.646 --> 16:22.115
(panting): That really
should've been easier for you.

16:22.149 --> 16:24.884
I'll hook you up
with some Joe Rogan supplements.

16:24.917 --> 16:26.619
Family discount.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.488
(panting, laughing)

16:32.992 --> 16:34.961
You're right.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.829
I'm worthless.

16:36.863 --> 16:39.132
I thought at least
if I was dead,

16:39.166 --> 16:40.733
then you'd get
the life insurance money.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.669
But then I 'membered
I never switched the auto-pay

16:42.702 --> 16:44.704
to the new card
after I left the old one

16:44.737 --> 16:46.906
at that churro stand
at Six Flags.

16:46.939 --> 16:48.975
Also, the new card
would've bounced

16:49.008 --> 16:51.010
on account of we're broke.

16:51.044 --> 16:53.680
So I guess I'm worthless,
dead or alive.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.584
You're worth something to me.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.088
I'm so pathetic.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.722
Being pregnant is the only time

17:02.755 --> 17:04.457
I've ever really felt special.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.428
I mean, since I stopped
playing Clarissa

17:08.461 --> 17:09.829
on the Nickelodeon cruise.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.431
You're always special.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.100
Even when you're being
a huge bitch.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.834
Aw.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.436
Remember before
when you said that thing

17:16.469 --> 17:18.338
about only wanting
to get knocked up

17:18.371 --> 17:19.672
because it made you
feel special?

17:19.706 --> 17:22.675
Well, if we're keeping it 100...

17:22.709 --> 17:24.744
I was stalling.

17:24.777 --> 17:27.680
Yeah, at first just for
the money, but then I realized

17:27.714 --> 17:31.184
the idea of you being preggers
with someone else's kiddo

17:31.218 --> 17:33.186
kind of made me feel...

17:33.220 --> 17:36.223
like not a man or whatnot.

17:37.257 --> 17:40.227
Anyjunk, feelings are stupid.

17:40.260 --> 17:44.197
Vernon, the fact that you were
even open to the idea

17:44.231 --> 17:46.799
in the first place
just shows how confident

17:46.833 --> 17:49.436
-and secure you are.
-(children laughing)

17:49.469 --> 17:51.037
And that's really sexy.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.240
Sexy, huh?

17:53.273 --> 17:55.408
-Very.
-GIRL: Here.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.746
Aw.

17:59.779 --> 18:02.048
Things are gonna get better
for us, just you wait.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.717
Once I get funding for
my Korean medical food truck,

18:04.751 --> 18:07.620
everything's gonna be
coming up Vernon. And Becca.

18:09.356 --> 18:11.057
And Tallulah. Shit.

18:11.090 --> 18:15.328
Well, I believe in you, honey.

18:15.362 --> 18:19.632
I mean, I have to.

18:19.666 --> 18:22.735
-(laughs)
-Ow!

18:22.769 --> 18:25.405
-Shitballs.
-Oh! Aw.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.840
Poor baby. Here.

18:29.842 --> 18:31.978
One hour to the eclipse!
I repeat,

18:32.011 --> 18:33.513
one hour to the ecl...

18:41.388 --> 18:44.757
Ladies and gentlemen, boys
and girls, this is the moment

18:44.791 --> 18:46.826
we've all been waiting for.
Are you ready?

18:46.859 --> 18:48.761
-CROWD: Yes!
-Well, then,

18:48.795 --> 18:50.096
look to the skies!

18:55.168 --> 18:56.569
(giggles)

19:00.807 --> 19:04.010
It's so neat.

19:04.043 --> 19:06.246
(indistinct chatter)

19:16.523 --> 19:19.359
(crowd cheering)

19:20.393 --> 19:22.229
GILMARTIN:
Yes!

19:23.930 --> 19:27.967
Brilliant! Brilliant!

19:28.000 --> 19:30.203
Absolutely brilliant.

19:30.237 --> 19:32.239
Ah, wonderful.

19:46.052 --> 19:48.821
GILMARTIN:
Eclipses never fail

19:48.855 --> 19:51.190
to cast their magic spells,
do they?

19:51.224 --> 19:53.826
-Indeed, they do not.
-(both chuckle)

19:53.860 --> 19:55.094
Please, have a seat.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.732
Did your guests
enjoy themselves?

19:59.766 --> 20:03.536
I think so. It's complicated.

20:03.570 --> 20:07.173
Oh, must be nice to have family.

20:07.206 --> 20:10.377
It's always just been me
and the cosmos.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.579
And the prostitutes.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.080
Well...

20:14.113 --> 20:16.516
I've come to understand
that the main attraction

20:16.549 --> 20:20.620
of having Becca as my surrogate
was so, in some small way,

20:20.653 --> 20:24.557
my marriage wouldn't have been
a total waste.

20:24.591 --> 20:27.294
Well, there is no waste
in the universe.

20:27.327 --> 20:31.364
When something comes to an end,
be it a galactic age,

20:31.398 --> 20:34.801
a star or a weekend away,

20:34.834 --> 20:38.638
it is simultaneously
the beginning of something else.

20:38.671 --> 20:42.875
Loss can be hard, but you might
be mourning something

20:42.909 --> 20:45.912
that was never actually there
in the first place.

20:45.945 --> 20:49.816
Yes, maybe this idea you had
of making a new family

20:49.849 --> 20:52.051
slipped through your fingers,

20:52.084 --> 20:55.388
but perhaps there's
something else already there

20:55.422 --> 20:57.424
that you've failed to see.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.835
(spits)

21:13.840 --> 21:16.443
-BECCA: Ooh!
-(Vernon chuckles)

21:23.550 --> 21:25.017
BECCA:
Oh!

21:30.490 --> 21:33.393

21:35.462 --> 21:38.598
Yeah. Oh, there.

21:38.631 --> 21:41.601
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.603

Doctor.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.038
Yeah. Oh.

Uh, uh... (clears throat)

22:46.232 --> 22:48.034
Um...

22:48.067 --> 22:51.538
I got you, bro.

22:51.571 --> 22:53.239
Oh.

22:53.272 --> 22:57.677

-Oh, this is really happening.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.078
(all moaning)

23:00.647 --> 23:02.114
-Oh, yeah.

23:30.409 --> 23:33.079

an eclipse last night?

23:33.112 --> 23:34.614
No. Who cares?

23:34.647 --> 23:37.149
I don't know. Dipshits like...

23:37.183 --> 23:40.620
Oh, shit.
I conjured them.

23:40.653 --> 23:41.954
Hey, guys.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.756
What are you doing in our diner?

23:43.790 --> 23:45.424
Your diner? I didn't know

23:45.458 --> 23:47.894
you'd gotten into
the restaurant business, Jimmy.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.563
(laughter)

23:50.597 --> 23:52.331
We're just getting b-fast.
Nothing weird about that.

23:52.364 --> 23:54.133
So don't try
to make it weird, okay?

23:54.166 --> 23:56.503
Okay, well,
great bumping into you. Not.

Have you been under

There's mean-girl issues
with my youngest,

25:03.402 --> 25:05.037
