00:08.384 --> 00:11.126
The matches of the adult division
of the Tenkaichi Budokai

00:11.345 --> 00:13.461
have at last gotten underway.

00:13.681 --> 00:20.769
First, Kuririn showed off his
overwhelming strength. However...

00:25.359 --> 00:27.771
Who exactly is this guy?

00:29.988 --> 00:32.070
You will learn, soon enough.

00:33.117 --> 00:35.449
You will learn, soon enough.

00:39.331 --> 00:41.037
l-l'm sorry...

00:45.421 --> 00:46.581
I'm dropping out.

00:46.797 --> 00:48.378
D-Dropping out?

00:49.425 --> 00:53.293
Incredibly, Piccolo bowed out without a fight.

00:53.512 --> 00:59.553
Is this truly how powerful
the mysterious Shin really is?

00:59.768 --> 01:03.477
And, as everyone felt a
great unrest coming on,

01:03.689 --> 01:09.810
the third match, between Videl
and Spopovitch, was about to start.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074

02:43.121 --> 02:48.457
"An Eerie Entity--Who Exactly is Spopovitch...?'l

02:51.880 --> 02:57.216
Videl! Videl! Videl!...

03:27.583 --> 03:29.665
This guy is so icky.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.752
That guy sure is absorbed with this.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.952
Videl! Good luck!

04:15.172 --> 04:18.380
Hey, that punk will be a pushover for Videl.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.834
Fight! Fight! Lovely Videl!

04:22.053 --> 04:25.842
Whaddya know, Gohan's girlfriend
is mighty popular, huh?

04:26.058 --> 04:26.888
So it seems.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.136
Huh? That girl is Gohan's...?

04:29.353 --> 04:32.971
Is that right? Gohan, aren't you the stud?

04:33.190 --> 04:37.274
I know, right! I understand she's
a ridiculously wealthy young girl!

04:37.486 --> 04:39.442
Gohan is such a good son to his ma!

04:39.655 --> 04:43.523
But she's Mister Satan's
one and only daughter.

04:43.742 --> 04:46.324
Th-That doesn't really matter, does it?

04:46.536 --> 04:48.788
That's an issue between the two of them.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.252
All right then, the third match!

05:02.469 --> 05:06.303
Contestant Videl versus
Contestant Spopovitch! Please begin!

05:26.326 --> 05:27.987
What is it?

05:28.203 --> 05:32.492
Perhaps I am mistaken,
but are you, by any chance...

05:32.708 --> 05:33.493
Yes?

05:33.709 --> 05:37.497
B-By any chance, are you the Grand Kaio-sama?

05:37.713 --> 05:41.046
No, I am not.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.294
No, he is not the Grand Kaio.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.552
He is the Kaioshin-sama.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.926
K-Kaioshin?!

05:58.066 --> 05:59.442
Oh, my!

05:59.651 --> 06:02.563
Contestant Videl suddenly
launches into an opening strike!

06:02.779 --> 06:06.488
This is tremendous! She is not
giving him time to strike back!

06:11.580 --> 06:14.037
Please, keep it to yourself for now.

06:15.292 --> 06:19.001
I do not wish for anyone else to know just yet.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.091
K-Kaioshin-sama...?

06:27.387 --> 06:31.972
At the head of the four Kaio-sama
stands the Grand Kaio-sama...

06:32.184 --> 06:34.550
And while I'd heard rumors
that there was another deity

06:34.770 --> 06:38.354
who reigned over all of the Kaio-sama...

06:44.446 --> 06:47.483
No wonder he's on such
a different sphere from us!

06:49.576 --> 06:50.656
What's wrong, Piccolo?

06:50.869 --> 06:53.360
Did that guy smart off to you, or something?

06:53.580 --> 06:57.038
If you want, I'll go give him
a piece of my mind.

06:57.250 --> 07:01.243
D-Don't! Don't say a word!
I'm begging you, don't say a word!

07:01.463 --> 07:02.748
Huh?

07:02.964 --> 07:09.585
Th-That young man is
the K-K-Kaioshin-sama...?

07:09.805 --> 07:12.638
l-l've never even met him, myself.

07:12.849 --> 07:16.137
Why would someone such as he be on Earth?

07:20.482 --> 07:24.020
Uh-oh! Contestant Spopovitch
has already gone down!

07:24.236 --> 07:25.976
I'll take the count!

07:29.825 --> 07:32.237
Contestant Spopovitch has gotten back up!

07:32.452 --> 07:35.239
It looks like he's still raring to go!

07:48.552 --> 07:51.794
Spopovitch sure has gotten
better at taking a beating, huh?

07:52.013 --> 07:54.846
So his appearance isn't the only
thing that's different, is it?

07:55.058 --> 07:56.559
No.

07:59.688 --> 08:03.021
When I first saw him,
I didn't realize it was him.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.489
Contestant Videl's attack is tremendous!

08:20.709 --> 08:24.201
However, Contestant Spopovitch
is tolerating it well!

08:34.014 --> 08:36.551
Yeah, way to go, Videl!

08:38.768 --> 08:41.350
Contestant Spopovitch has gone down!

08:41.563 --> 08:43.599
Er, no, he's getting up!

08:45.025 --> 08:47.266
He has gotten up!

09:00.624 --> 09:01.739
How is that girl doing?

09:01.958 --> 09:03.289
She can bring it.

09:03.501 --> 09:06.208
Yes. She completely has
the upper hand in ability.

09:06.421 --> 09:08.332
Her moves are landing, one after the next.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.460
Hmph, it's a low-level fight.

09:16.181 --> 09:18.797
And he goes down again!

09:19.809 --> 09:22.016
True to this gifted young lady's reputation!

09:22.229 --> 09:24.265
Contestant Spopovitch
may be a giant of a man,

09:24.481 --> 09:26.938
but he is in completely over his head!

09:28.610 --> 09:29.895
Looking cool!

09:30.111 --> 09:31.100
Nice going, Videl!

09:31.321 --> 09:33.812
That girl is pretty good, isn't she?

09:34.032 --> 09:35.147
Yeah, really.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.733
She's a perfect girlfriend
for Gohan-kun, isn't she?

09:37.953 --> 09:40.990
Yes, she is! I think so, too!

09:41.206 --> 09:45.290
Now l have to do whatever
it takes to get them to marry!

09:45.502 --> 09:49.165
You're kidding, right?
Is that really Mister Satan's daughter?

09:49.381 --> 09:51.667
See? She's pretty good, right?

09:57.180 --> 09:58.761
N-No way...!

10:00.016 --> 10:03.725
Whoa! Once again, Contestant Spopovitch
has gotten up unfazed!

10:03.937 --> 10:06.349
What toughness he has!

10:19.369 --> 10:21.985
This has taken an unexpected turn!

10:22.205 --> 10:24.241
Even after Contestant Videl's fierce attack,

10:24.457 --> 10:28.166
the damage appears to be unfelt
by Contestant Spopovitch!

10:54.029 --> 10:56.520
You sure are persistent. Geez!

11:09.669 --> 11:11.660
All right! It's over!

11:20.138 --> 11:22.470
It's all over!

11:27.812 --> 11:30.599
Contestant Videl launches a
tremendous rapid-fire attack!

11:30.815 --> 11:35.024
Even Contestant Spopovitch
has to be utterly, ut--

11:51.252 --> 11:52.958
H-He's up...

11:53.171 --> 11:54.502
H-He can't be!

11:54.714 --> 11:56.955
She should drop out of the match.

11:57.175 --> 11:58.836
Something ain't right about that guy.

11:59.052 --> 12:03.011
Eh? Drop out? But Videl is
way ahead of him right now.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.054
Th-That's right!

12:37.465 --> 12:38.875
Ah! Videl!

12:39.092 --> 12:43.335
Ha! Relax. Videl is just
having a little fun with him.

12:43.555 --> 12:44.795
Keep it together!

12:45.014 --> 12:48.632
I can't let you be Gohan's wife
if you're goin' to do that!

12:48.852 --> 12:51.810
It sounds like Chichi-san will be
one nagging mother-in-law, huh?

12:52.021 --> 12:53.522
Y-Yeah...

13:06.244 --> 13:07.575
Ah! Sh-She'll land out!

13:07.787 --> 13:09.288
Oh, no!

13:23.094 --> 13:25.085
She stopped...!

13:27.891 --> 13:31.133
A-Amazingly, Contestant Videl
is flying through the air!

13:31.352 --> 13:33.434
She has not fallen out!

13:39.569 --> 13:40.775
W-What the...?

13:40.987 --> 13:42.272
What's going on?

13:42.489 --> 13:43.695
Nice going, nice going!

13:43.907 --> 13:46.740
I'm the one who taught her Bukujutusu.

13:46.951 --> 13:50.535
She may have been better off
falling out just now.

13:50.747 --> 13:53.955
Sure enough, there's something
strange about that Spopovitch guy.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.659
After all the damage he must have taken,
he's far too together,

13:57.879 --> 14:00.370
and I ain't sensing any life
to speak of from him.

14:00.590 --> 14:04.208
Any life to speak of? W-What does that mean?

14:04.427 --> 14:07.544
Beats me. I can't tell that much.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.933
What?! Videl is about to get
clobbered by Spopovitch?!

14:17.190 --> 14:19.021
There has to be some kind of mistake.

14:19.234 --> 14:21.065
Spopovitch is the guy that I beat

14:21.277 --> 14:24.610
in the first round of the last tournament.

14:25.740 --> 14:29.153
Videl is far more capable than he is.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.234
Perhaps so, but he seems to have gotten

14:31.454 --> 14:33.319
much better since last time.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.206
It's for show! For show!

14:37.418 --> 14:39.909
Videl, you rascal! You're taking a cue from me,

14:40.129 --> 14:42.871
and you're trying to liven up
the tournament, huh?

14:43.883 --> 14:45.168
Do you think so?

14:45.385 --> 14:47.216
Of course that's what she's doing!

15:13.746 --> 15:20.242
C-Contestant Spopovitch's neck
has been broken!

15:20.461 --> 15:22.326
Sh-She killed him!

15:27.844 --> 15:29.960
Sh-She killed the guy!

15:39.230 --> 15:40.731
No, don't watch!

15:52.493 --> 15:57.613
L-Ladies and gentlemen,
we have arrived at a tragic conclusion.

15:57.832 --> 15:59.572
In accordance with tournament rules,

15:59.792 --> 16:04.627
Contestant Videl, having killed
her opponent, is disqualified--

16:37.622 --> 16:41.991
W-W-What's this?!
His neck has gone back to normal!

16:42.210 --> 16:44.075
What in the world is this...?

16:50.218 --> 16:52.755
W-What is with this guy...?

17:18.871 --> 17:22.204
Goku is right. She should give up already.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.782
That bastard is definitely not normal.

17:29.465 --> 17:33.049
Whoa! Contestant Videl is flying once again!

17:38.266 --> 17:40.302
That's good! Flee up into the air for now,

17:40.518 --> 17:42.804
and wait for your strength to recover!

17:50.987 --> 17:52.852
H-He's flying!

17:53.072 --> 17:54.687
H-He can't be!

18:01.122 --> 18:02.987
H-How can this be happening?!

18:03.207 --> 18:06.040
Contestant Spopovitch has also taken flight!

18:09.005 --> 18:10.495
No way!

18:29.692 --> 18:34.732
H-Hey... ls flying becoming a new thing now?

18:34.947 --> 18:40.692
|-| don't believe it.
Is Spopovitch able to do that now?

18:40.912 --> 18:42.573
Th-There's no way.

18:50.546 --> 18:53.583
How can he be flying, too...?

19:13.110 --> 19:14.941
A-A Ki blast!

19:37.885 --> 19:41.173
W-What kind of guy is this?

19:41.389 --> 19:43.425
Th-That bastard!

19:43.641 --> 19:47.429
It may not have been very forceful,
but still, he used a Ki blast!

19:47.645 --> 19:49.510
That's not all.

19:49.730 --> 19:53.973
If he kills her, he'll lose.
He shot a weak one on purpose.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.900
W-Why is he...?

19:57.113 --> 20:02.733
Looks like he somehow got hold of a lot
more power than he'd normally have.

20:02.952 --> 20:09.323
He shouldn't be powerful enough
to master Bukujutsu or Ki blasts.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.248
What does that mean?

20:11.460 --> 20:16.625
I don't know. How did he get such power?

20:21.012 --> 20:24.721
I don't care who this guy is. I'm still Videl!

20:24.932 --> 20:27.719
I'm the daughter of Mister Satan,
the man who defeated Cell!

20:27.935 --> 20:30.551
I should definitely be able to beat him!

20:55.713 --> 20:59.752
Contestant Videl goes down!
Was that the clinching blow?!

21:06.515 --> 21:09.882
Oh, my! Contestant Videl has not given up yet!

21:10.102 --> 21:13.936
With indomitable spirit,
she is trying to get up again!

21:14.148 --> 21:17.857
L-Like I'll ever give up!

21:18.069 --> 21:23.359
Spopovitch is able to fly
and even use Ki blasts.

21:23.574 --> 21:27.658
Just what is the secret to this man's strength?

21:27.870 --> 21:32.955
And with her back to the wall,
how will Videl fight back?

22:41.777 --> 22:43.233
Heya! l'm Goku!

22:43.446 --> 22:46.688
That Spopovitch guy is one outlandish freak!

22:46.907 --> 22:49.398
How can he go that far
against a female opponent?

22:50.411 --> 22:54.370
He'll pay for this!
You'll pay for this, Spopovitch!

22:54.582 --> 22:56.197
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:56.417 --> 22:59.580
"Videl Battered--Gohan's Fury
Reaches |ts Limit!!"

22:59.795 --> 23:04.755
Why, you...! How dare you
put Videl through this?!
