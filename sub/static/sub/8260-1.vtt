00:21.256 --> 00:23.190
- You got the note?
- Yeah, right.

00:23.258 --> 00:26.887
Nice and tight.
Two, three, four.

00:58.160 --> 01:01.891
This is the Fordham section
of The Bronx: my home.

01:01.964 --> 01:03.829
A world unto itself.

01:03.899 --> 01:06.163
Any borough
is only 15 minutes away...

01:06.235 --> 01:08.760
but they seem 3,000 miles away.

01:11.173 --> 01:12.970
That's Mount Carmel Church.

01:13.041 --> 01:15.942
The sound of the bells
filled the neighborhood.

01:26.188 --> 01:30.022
It was 1960, and doo-wop
was the sound on the streets.

01:33.095 --> 01:37.031
I felt like there was a doo-wop
group on every corner back then.

01:39.835 --> 01:41.769
What a time it was.

01:43.405 --> 01:46.932
The Yankees were playing the
Pirates in the World Series...

01:47.009 --> 01:49.671
and Mickey Mantle
was like a god to me.

01:49.745 --> 01:53.681
My dad and I would go to Yankee
Stadium and see the Yankees win.

01:56.185 --> 01:59.643
That's the Chez Bippy,
where all the guys hung out.

01:59.721 --> 02:02.155
I'll tell you about them later.

02:05.627 --> 02:08.721
That's my building.
I live on the third floor.

02:08.797 --> 02:11.595
667 East 187th Street.

02:14.336 --> 02:15.769
There's my stoop.

02:18.640 --> 02:21.632
On warm summer nights
all through the neighborhood...

02:21.710 --> 02:24.770
you would hear young Italian men
romancing their women.

02:24.846 --> 02:26.905
Hey, Marie!

02:26.982 --> 02:29.951
- Get in the fucking car!
- No!

02:30.018 --> 02:32.543
- Get in the car!
- Leave me alone.

02:32.621 --> 02:35.089
- You know I love you.
- Yeah, bullshit.

02:35.157 --> 02:37.182
Get in the fucking car!

02:47.436 --> 02:50.530
And right there,
under that lamppost there...

02:50.606 --> 02:54.542
stood the number-one man
in the neighborhood, Sonny.

02:55.611 --> 02:58.546
Everybody loved Sonny
and treated him like a god.

02:59.615 --> 03:02.482
And in my neighborhood,
he was a god.

03:03.585 --> 03:07.112
I would sit on my stoop and
watch him, all day and night.

03:08.023 --> 03:10.321
But he would never even
look at me.

03:10.392 --> 03:13.259
Never, until one day.

03:21.637 --> 03:24.765
- What do you want?
- You got room there for us?

03:24.840 --> 03:26.364
You wish.

05:19.454 --> 05:21.319
- Oh, shit!
- Let's go!

05:50.652 --> 05:52.347
That's my dad, Lorenzo Anello.

05:53.388 --> 05:57.757
His bus route was 187th Street.
I used to love riding with him.

05:58.493 --> 06:01.223
That's me, Calogero,
at nine years old.

06:21.583 --> 06:24.017
See you later, Pop.

06:31.860 --> 06:33.350
Go right upstairs, son.

06:34.396 --> 06:38.332
That's my mom, Rosina.
She met my dad at a dance.

06:38.400 --> 06:41.062
They fell in love
and been together since.

06:49.644 --> 06:52.579
You're always listening.
Take care of this fucking...

08:22.938 --> 08:25.168
Come on. Knock him out!

08:33.615 --> 08:36.549
The Chez Bippy.
This is where all the guys hung out.

08:36.618 --> 08:39.644
Get the fuck out of here!
Take a walk!

08:40.554 --> 08:43.524
Tony Toupee was owner of the bar
in name only.

08:43.592 --> 08:45.526
It was really Sonny's place.

08:48.863 --> 08:51.491
Tony was a frustrated singer.
Everybody hated his voice.

08:51.566 --> 08:54.626
So just for spite, he would
never utter a spoken word.

08:54.703 --> 08:56.193
He would only sing it.

08:56.271 --> 08:59.069
He was Tony Toupee
because of his lousy hairpiece.

09:03.912 --> 09:06.005
Eddie Mush
was a degenerate gambler.

09:06.081 --> 09:08.276
He was the world's
biggest loser.

09:08.350 --> 09:11.251
He was "Mush" because everything
he touched turned to mush.

09:11.319 --> 09:13.685
Never mind.
I need a winner.

09:13.755 --> 09:17.384
At the track, the teller would
give him his tickets ripped up.

09:17.459 --> 09:19.484
I had the Yankees. They lost.

09:19.561 --> 09:22.997
If it wasn't for bad luck,
I wouldn't have no luck at all.

09:24.432 --> 09:26.332
JoJo the Whale.

09:26.401 --> 09:28.961
You didn't walk with JoJo,
you walked among him.

09:29.037 --> 09:32.165
If you stared long enough,
you'd see him get fatter by the hour.

09:33.141 --> 09:36.269
Legend has it his shadow
once killed a dog.

09:39.114 --> 09:40.775
They called him
Frankie Coffeecake...

09:40.849 --> 09:44.376
because his face looked like
a Drake's Coffeecake.

09:44.452 --> 09:47.012
He was tough to look at.

09:59.734 --> 10:01.759
Hey, kid, how you doing?

10:03.505 --> 10:06.372
His name was Jimmy Whispers.
He was Sonny's main man.

10:07.442 --> 10:10.605
He was "Whispers" because
everything was a secret to him.

10:15.850 --> 10:17.875
Danny K.O. knocked guys out...

10:17.952 --> 10:20.853
and Bobby Bars spent
half his life behind them.

10:20.922 --> 10:24.824
This was Sonny's crew, and
nobody fucked with these guys.

10:25.894 --> 10:30.763
What are you doing here
Didn't we tell you not to come here?

10:30.832 --> 10:34.461
I told you to come upstairs!
Wait till I tell your father!

10:34.536 --> 10:38.097
- What were you doing here?
- I was looking for Daddy.

10:38.173 --> 10:39.606
That's very nice!

10:41.342 --> 10:43.435
I have to get something in the store.
Don't move!

10:43.511 --> 10:46.207
You wait right here! You hear me?

10:48.383 --> 10:52.877
I always tried to imitate Sonny.
He still wouldn't look at me.

10:57.892 --> 11:00.156
Sonny had five fingers...

11:00.228 --> 11:02.287
but he only used three.

11:04.432 --> 11:06.866
Come on. Let's go.
Move. Upstairs.

11:14.809 --> 11:16.743
I'm not in the mood for steak.

11:16.811 --> 11:18.836
You're not?

11:18.913 --> 11:21.404
You know how often I have to drive
that bus back and forth...

11:21.483 --> 11:23.747
so we can eat steak once a week?

11:23.818 --> 11:25.752
- Seven.
- Who told you that?

11:25.820 --> 11:27.082
Nobody. I counted.

11:27.155 --> 11:29.248
Your father
wants to talk to you.

11:29.324 --> 11:32.657
- About what?
- You were by the bar today.

11:32.727 --> 11:35.287
- I wasn't.
- Tell your father the truth!

11:35.363 --> 11:37.661
- I was by the bar.
- Why'd you lie?

11:37.732 --> 11:40.064
- I took a shot.
- Wanna do something here?

11:40.135 --> 11:42.262
What am I gonna say?
Nice try, son.

11:42.337 --> 11:44.999
- Thanks, Dad.
- Lorenzo, come on, please!

11:45.073 --> 11:47.234
How can I keep him away?
It's two doors away.

11:47.308 --> 11:49.572
Daddy's right.
Listen to him.

11:49.644 --> 11:51.407
Shut up.
Nobody's talking to you.

11:51.479 --> 11:53.344
Give me your plate.

11:53.414 --> 11:56.815
I want you to listen to me.

11:56.885 --> 12:00.787
Do not go near the bar.
Stay on the stoop.

12:00.855 --> 12:03.653
- When you're older, you'll understand.
- Yes.

12:03.725 --> 12:08.025
- You don't see me going there.
- Mommy won't let you go either?

12:08.096 --> 12:11.259
- What am I going to do?
- I got him all day.

12:11.332 --> 12:13.892
I'm just kidding.
I'll won't go near the bar.

12:18.473 --> 12:22.102
Look what I got. Two tickets,
Yankee Stadium, center field.

12:22.177 --> 12:24.509
- Behind the Mick?
- Right behind number seven.

12:24.579 --> 12:27.207
- Now eat your steak.
- Yeah!

12:31.419 --> 12:33.444
Let's go, Alfie.

12:33.521 --> 12:35.614
That's Phil the Peddler.

12:35.690 --> 12:37.851
He would call everybody "Mary."

12:37.926 --> 12:40.861
Me and my friends would
love to break his balls.

12:43.398 --> 12:46.231
Slick and Crazy Mario
were my best friends.

12:46.301 --> 12:48.769
Slick got his name
because of his hair.

12:48.837 --> 12:51.670
Mario got his
because he was just crazy.

12:54.042 --> 12:57.569
I'll kick your fucking asses
for you, you bunch of Marys.

12:59.180 --> 13:02.445
Stay away from the fruit!
Keep your hands off the fruit!

13:02.517 --> 13:03.984
You fucking Marys!

13:04.052 --> 13:07.317
I'll kick you loose, you Marys!
The three of you!

13:07.388 --> 13:11.119
I'll kick your fucking asses,
you fucking ball breakers!

13:11.192 --> 13:15.822
Stay away from the vegetables!
What do you think this is?

13:15.897 --> 13:19.094
Wait! Go make your mother
and father feed you!

13:19.167 --> 13:23.001
I'll give you the heave-ho,
you fucking ball breakers!

13:24.539 --> 13:25.870
How many did you get?

13:25.940 --> 13:27.874
You don't stop
borrowing money!

13:27.942 --> 13:30.502
Oh, boy,
Coffeecake's in trouble again.

13:30.578 --> 13:32.102
What should I do?

13:32.180 --> 13:33.807
He's gonna get his ass kicked.

13:33.882 --> 13:37.079
Guys, check it out.
Mario, who's this?

13:45.260 --> 13:48.593
That's Jimmy Whispers.

13:48.663 --> 13:52.030
You'd better talk to him again.
You're responsible for him.

13:52.100 --> 13:54.034
Whoa! Come on, wait a minute.

13:59.140 --> 14:01.370
It's Sonny.

14:02.277 --> 14:05.678
You do somebody now,
big mouth.

14:05.747 --> 14:08.045
Do somebody hard,
like Coffeecake.

14:08.116 --> 14:11.313
- I can't do Coffeecake!
- That's hard.

14:11.386 --> 14:14.844
Put a screen in front of your
face while I throw shit at it.

14:16.724 --> 14:18.157
Oh, shit.

14:19.460 --> 14:22.554
These niggers got some balls,
coming in our neighborhood.

14:22.630 --> 14:25.190
They just pass through
from school.

14:25.266 --> 14:28.064
- How the fuck do you know?
- Dad told me.

14:28.136 --> 14:31.071
My father told me
that's how it starts.

14:32.240 --> 14:35.937
Hey, get the fuck out of our
neighborhood, fucking niggers!

14:36.010 --> 14:37.944
Go back where you came from!

14:38.012 --> 14:40.640
You're lucky
you're on that bus!

14:40.715 --> 14:43.081
Go back where you came from!

14:43.151 --> 14:47.247
Stay out of our neighborhood!
I'll kick your fucking ass!

14:51.192 --> 14:52.625
Why?

15:04.973 --> 15:09.034
You don't fucking stop.
Get the fuck out of here!

15:09.110 --> 15:11.374
Nobody's cooler than you, Sonny.

15:15.450 --> 15:18.010
What the fuck is wrong with you?

15:18.086 --> 15:20.748
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you, you scumbag!

15:20.822 --> 15:23.916
You motherfucker!
I'll bust your fucking head!

15:26.027 --> 15:28.086
I'll bust your fucking head!

15:36.571 --> 15:38.004
What's going on here?

15:39.907 --> 15:41.340
Give me the gun!

15:41.409 --> 15:43.400
Move the fucking car!

15:45.880 --> 15:47.279
Come on!

15:56.858 --> 15:59.918
When Sonny looked at me,
I went deaf.

15:59.994 --> 16:01.621
I couldn't hear.

16:01.696 --> 16:05.132
All I could see was Sonny
with the gun in his hand.

16:30.591 --> 16:31.888
What happened?

16:31.959 --> 16:33.756
Dad, it was just
a parking space.

16:33.828 --> 16:35.989
- You don't understand.
- Is he all right?

16:36.064 --> 16:38.191
- Baby, are you okay?
- Let's go inside.

16:38.266 --> 16:40.461
- What happened?
- I'm okay, Mom.

16:40.535 --> 16:43.834
Oh, my god, I got so scared.

16:46.874 --> 16:52.471
You don't understand. They were
fighting over a parking space. Why?

16:52.547 --> 16:55.277
It wasn't over a parking space.
They just met at the wrong time.

16:55.349 --> 16:57.544
- What kind of answer is that?
- Leave it alone.

16:57.618 --> 16:59.552
He's okay.
That's the main thing.

16:59.620 --> 17:01.781
I can't believe somebody
would do this.

17:05.560 --> 17:06.959
Who is it?

17:07.028 --> 17:09.291
Police. Is this
the Anello residence?

17:11.465 --> 17:13.023
Yeah. Can I help you?

17:13.101 --> 17:15.729
We'd like to ask you
some questions.

17:16.436 --> 17:19.031
- About what?
- Just open the door!

17:24.779 --> 17:26.679
How you doing? Good.

17:26.747 --> 17:29.307
I'm Detective Belsik.
This is Detective Vella.

17:29.383 --> 17:31.146
Hello, son. How you doing, ma'am?

17:32.053 --> 17:33.953
We'd like to ask your son
a few questions.

17:34.021 --> 17:36.717
- About what?
- There was a shooting outside.

17:36.791 --> 17:40.591
- We believe your son was there.
- Really? He knows nothing about that.

17:40.661 --> 17:42.561
There were people who saw him.

17:42.630 --> 17:44.564
They're wrong.
He don't know nothing.

17:44.632 --> 17:48.534
We can do things
the nice way or the hard way.

17:48.603 --> 17:50.833
I don't care.
He don't know nothing.

17:50.905 --> 17:53.100
Daddy, I know everything.

17:56.310 --> 17:58.835
Kids. Sometimes they
make believe they see things.

17:58.913 --> 18:03.009
We didn't pick your name out of a hat.
We know he was there. So let's go.

18:05.019 --> 18:08.284
Son, here's what
I'd like you to do for us.

18:08.356 --> 18:11.951
Take a walk downstairs with us and
your father. We have people down there.

18:12.026 --> 18:16.326
I want you to pick out
the person you saw with the gun.

18:16.397 --> 18:19.628
That's it. You think
you could do that for us?

18:31.746 --> 18:34.078
Good. Come on.
Let's take a walk.

18:34.148 --> 18:36.776
Mr. Anello,
take a walk downstairs.

18:37.952 --> 18:40.443
- We won't be long.
- Will he be okay?

18:40.521 --> 18:43.422
Everything's fine.
They'll be back in two minutes.

19:06.180 --> 19:07.647
There's Lorenzo.

19:40.047 --> 19:41.639
Fellas, turn around.

19:44.585 --> 19:46.780
You two, take your hats off.

19:48.089 --> 19:51.547
Put your head up.
Straight ahead. Look this way.

19:51.626 --> 19:53.992
- Is that him?
- No.

20:00.935 --> 20:03.665
How about this guy?
Straight ahead, fella.

20:03.738 --> 20:04.966
How about him?

20:08.009 --> 20:10.910
Straight ahead, you.
How about this guy?

20:13.314 --> 20:15.680
Give me an answer.
How about him?

20:20.821 --> 20:23.312
How about him?
Is it this guy?

20:25.826 --> 20:27.623
Give me an answer.

20:32.366 --> 20:34.300
Hey! Put your eyes up!

20:35.770 --> 20:37.499
How about this guy?

20:42.977 --> 20:45.878
Let's go. Hey, look
straight ahead! Over here.

20:48.449 --> 20:50.280
Look at me. That's it.

20:50.351 --> 20:51.978
Is it this guy?

20:53.754 --> 20:56.052
- How about this guy?
- No.

20:59.360 --> 21:02.056
Look at this guy.
How about him?

21:03.597 --> 21:05.758
Hey! Straight ahead.

21:07.201 --> 21:10.364
How about this guy?
Is it him?

21:25.720 --> 21:26.982
Give me an answer.

21:31.625 --> 21:33.217
- You satisfied, Officer?
- No.

21:33.294 --> 21:36.320
- He don't know.
- Yeah, yeah, he doesn't know.

21:36.397 --> 21:39.059
- He said he can't help you.
- Take a walk.

21:39.133 --> 21:41.897
- Go ahead. Take a walk.
- Come on, son.

21:48.342 --> 21:51.834
You guys can breathe again.
Get out of my sight.

21:56.150 --> 21:59.051
- We really fooled them, Dad.
- Yeah.

22:00.121 --> 22:02.487
I didn't rat, Dad.

22:02.556 --> 22:03.989
No, you didn't rat.

22:05.092 --> 22:07.026
I did a good thing, right?

22:07.094 --> 22:10.325
Yeah, you did a good thing
for a bad man.

22:12.299 --> 22:14.995
I did a good thing
for a bad man.

22:15.069 --> 22:17.663
I didn't understand that
at nine years old.

22:18.706 --> 22:20.367
All I knew was...

22:20.441 --> 22:23.376
a rat was the lowest thing you
could be in my neighborhood...

22:23.444 --> 22:24.741
and I didn't rat.

22:40.728 --> 22:43.959
Why did you say I did
a good thing for a bad man?

22:45.866 --> 22:50.462
Because sometimes you have to do
things that aren't right.

22:52.139 --> 22:53.629
Do you understand?

22:54.809 --> 22:58.677
No. It's just that I thought
I did the right thing.

22:58.746 --> 23:00.646
Now I'm not sure I did.

23:00.714 --> 23:04.081
You did do the right thing.
When you get older, you'll see.

23:04.151 --> 23:06.278
Your mother and I
love you very much.

23:12.026 --> 23:14.893
Tomorrow you ride
on the bus with me. Okay?

23:18.599 --> 23:21.796
City Island was the last stop
on my father's route.

23:21.869 --> 23:24.497
It was one of our
favorite places.

23:24.572 --> 23:27.063
It was like
a daylong vacation.

23:27.708 --> 23:31.075
My dad listened to jazz
and we talked about baseball.

23:36.116 --> 23:37.913
Can I have an ice cream?

23:38.652 --> 23:41.348
We do our job first,
then ice cream.

23:41.422 --> 23:42.855
Okay, Pop.

23:45.693 --> 23:47.126
Here.

23:48.562 --> 23:51.929
- Let's play the game.
- Let's see how good you are.

23:51.999 --> 23:54.092
What player last won
the Triple Crown?

23:54.168 --> 23:57.569
Mickey Mantle.
Batting average, .353.

23:57.638 --> 24:01.734
RBls, 130. Home runs, 52.

24:02.643 --> 24:05.703
- That's pretty good.
- He's the greatest player ever.

24:05.779 --> 24:07.713
Joe D.'s
the greatest ballplayer.

24:08.883 --> 24:12.876
The Yankee Clipper.
56-game hitting streak.

24:12.953 --> 24:15.854
- Nobody beat that. Right, Dad?
- Nobody beat that, son.

24:17.057 --> 24:20.185
- You know why Joe D. was great?
- Because he was Italian?

24:20.261 --> 24:23.253
- Well, that's part of it.
- Then why?

24:23.330 --> 24:26.766
Because he had the most talent.
That's right.

24:28.102 --> 24:33.005
- Do I have talent, Dad?
- Of course you do.

24:33.073 --> 24:34.734
Can I be a ballplayer?

24:35.543 --> 24:37.807
You can be anything
you want to be.

24:37.878 --> 24:40.745
The saddest thing in life
is wasted talent.

24:40.814 --> 24:45.080
If you've got talent and do the
wrong thing, nothing happens.

24:45.152 --> 24:47.950
But when you do right,
good things happen.

24:48.022 --> 24:50.684
- You hear me?
- You're right.

24:50.758 --> 24:53.192
- Let's get that ice cream.
- Good.

24:54.595 --> 24:57.530
- I'll shut the doors, right?
- Yeah.

25:00.901 --> 25:02.459
Ready. Watch it.

25:04.705 --> 25:06.866
- Got it?
- I got it.

25:08.742 --> 25:13.304
Wasted talent was something my
father talked about all my life.

25:14.682 --> 25:17.173
Let's hurry.
The game's starting.

25:17.251 --> 25:20.948
36,683 here to see
the final game...

25:21.021 --> 25:22.886
of the '60 Series.

25:22.957 --> 25:25.323
And what a ball game
they're looking at.

25:25.392 --> 25:28.793
Moose Skowron, with that
infield hit deep to third...

25:28.862 --> 25:32.559
has picked up his twelfth
World Series base hit in 1960.

25:37.571 --> 25:39.334
Time called. Blanchard back...

25:42.576 --> 25:44.339
Come on, Sonny.

25:48.882 --> 25:51.874
One out, unassisted,
to Nelson, to end the sixth.

25:52.486 --> 25:56.047
Southpaw hitter.
Elroy Face...

25:56.123 --> 25:58.318
staring down to
his battery mate Hal Smith.

25:58.392 --> 26:01.293
Into the stretch.
The little man sets.

26:01.362 --> 26:03.125
Here's the first one
to Blanchard.

26:03.197 --> 26:04.892
Outside and a ball.

26:08.969 --> 26:10.664
See you later, Pop.

26:16.644 --> 26:19.772
Get right upstairs
and watch the rest of the game.

26:19.847 --> 26:21.838
No hanging out, son.

26:30.824 --> 26:32.951
Hey, Lorenzo, how you doing?

26:33.027 --> 26:35.427
Keep driving.
I want to talk to you.

26:37.297 --> 26:39.356
Your kid is a good kid.

26:39.433 --> 26:40.798
Thanks.

26:40.868 --> 26:43.302
Sonny appreciates
what you two did.

26:43.370 --> 26:46.271
That's all right. I'm just glad
everything worked out.

26:46.340 --> 26:47.602
He'll help you now.

26:47.675 --> 26:51.338
You drop some numbers off for us
and make $150 a week.

26:51.412 --> 26:55.712
- Do it right off the bus.
- Thanks, but I got a city job.

26:55.783 --> 26:57.944
- I could lose it.
- Think about it.

26:58.018 --> 27:00.043
I just can't do it.

27:00.120 --> 27:02.782
$150 a week. You don't
want to think about it?

27:02.856 --> 27:05.825
I can't do this.
It's not for me.

27:05.893 --> 27:09.226
Sonny will be disappointed,
but I'll give him your answer.

27:10.564 --> 27:13.055
Stop the bus.
I want to get off.

27:31.185 --> 27:33.949
- They offered me a job today.
- Doing what?

27:34.021 --> 27:37.752
Numbers. I just drop off
a piece of paper...

27:37.825 --> 27:39.759
and get 150 a week.

27:39.827 --> 27:41.954
What did you say?

27:42.029 --> 27:45.863
What do you think?
I told him it's not for me.

27:50.337 --> 27:51.804
What?

27:52.740 --> 27:56.801
I don't know. 150 dollars?
It's only numbers.

27:56.877 --> 28:00.142
- You think I should've took it?
- I don't know.

28:01.548 --> 28:05.882
But you get involved with those guys,
next thing, one, two three...

28:13.994 --> 28:15.655
I don't like the way you look.

28:16.530 --> 28:17.963
Maybe you're right.

28:19.233 --> 28:22.669
- I'm going to check on the baby.
- Come here.

28:22.736 --> 28:24.670
- What?
- Come here.

28:26.573 --> 28:29.736
Are you sorry you got stuck
with a bus driver?

28:29.810 --> 28:33.007
I fell in love
with your uniform.

28:42.256 --> 28:45.191
The day of the funeral,
I felt really bad.

28:45.259 --> 28:49.719
I realized a man died, and I
lied and committed a mortal sin.

28:49.797 --> 28:51.731
I wanted God's forgiveness.

29:02.676 --> 29:04.803
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

29:04.878 --> 29:07.608
It has been one month
since my last confession...

29:07.681 --> 29:11.481
and these are my sins:
I missed Sunday Mass twice...

29:11.552 --> 29:13.884
I lied
about witnessing a murder once.

29:13.954 --> 29:18.254
- I ate meat on Friday...
- Wait. Can you back up a bit?

29:19.293 --> 29:20.851
I ate meat on Friday once?

29:20.928 --> 29:23.362
Not that one.
Back up a little more.

29:23.430 --> 29:26.729
- About witnessing a murder?
- Yeah, that's the one.

29:26.800 --> 29:29.268
Do you realize what you said?

29:29.336 --> 29:31.167
It was only once.

29:31.238 --> 29:35.402
- Do you know what the fifth is?
- Yes, Father, I know.

29:35.475 --> 29:37.807
"I refuse to answer
because I might incrimin..."

29:37.878 --> 29:39.470
The Fifth Commandment.

29:40.447 --> 29:41.937
"Thou shall not kill."

29:43.417 --> 29:47.615
That's right. Now, I want you
to tell me what happened.

29:47.688 --> 29:50.282
No, Father, I'm not
telling nobody nothing.

29:50.357 --> 29:52.325
Don't be afraid, my son.

29:52.392 --> 29:56.158
- Nobody's more powerful than God.
- I don't know about that.

29:56.230 --> 29:58.357
Your guy's
bigger than my guy up there...

29:58.432 --> 30:00.866
but my guy's bigger than yours
down here.

30:03.904 --> 30:08.034
You got a point. Five Our
Fathers and five Hail Marys.

30:08.108 --> 30:10.440
For a murder rap? Not bad.

30:10.510 --> 30:13.274
- What did you say?
- Bye, Father!

30:13.347 --> 30:16.248
It was great to be Catholic
and go to confession.

30:16.316 --> 30:18.250
You could start over
every week.

30:29.162 --> 30:30.891
Hey, kid!

30:34.468 --> 30:38.529
Sonny wants to see you. Nobody's
going to grab that bike.

30:46.880 --> 30:49.815
They're good kids.
They just did some work for me.

30:49.883 --> 30:52.078
- Put them in.
- It's up to you.

30:53.654 --> 30:56.987
Here's the kid, Sonny.
Go ahead. Don't be afraid.

31:08.001 --> 31:10.094
How you doing, kid?

31:11.004 --> 31:12.437
Good.

31:14.408 --> 31:16.808
We finally meet face-to-face.

31:20.914 --> 31:22.347
Are you afraid of me?

31:23.650 --> 31:25.174
- No.
- That's good.

31:26.186 --> 31:27.653
What's your name?

31:28.322 --> 31:29.721
Calogero.

31:30.524 --> 31:33.357
That's a big name.
You got a nickname?

31:36.396 --> 31:39.729
- What do your friends call you?
- Calogero.

31:39.800 --> 31:41.495
That makes sense.

31:42.569 --> 31:44.264
Are you a Yankee fan?

31:47.474 --> 31:49.066
Sit down.

31:51.044 --> 31:53.911
Come over here.
Sit next to me.

31:59.653 --> 32:02.918
You must be pretty upset
after the Yankees lost.

32:02.990 --> 32:06.357
Bill Mazeroski, I hate him.

32:06.426 --> 32:10.522
He made Mickey Mantle cry.
The papers said the Mick cried.

32:10.597 --> 32:13.293
Mickey Mantle?
That's what you're upset about?

32:13.367 --> 32:16.768
Mantle makes $100,000 a year.
How much does your father make?

32:16.837 --> 32:19.670
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

32:19.740 --> 32:23.039
If your dad needs money, go ask
Mickey Mantle. See what happens.

32:23.110 --> 32:26.477
Mickey Mantle don't care about
you. Why care about him?

32:26.546 --> 32:27.945
Nobody cares.

32:30.017 --> 32:31.678
Can I ask you something?

32:31.752 --> 32:33.413
Sure.

32:34.588 --> 32:37.523
Did you shoot that man
over a parking space?

32:42.262 --> 32:44.787
When you get older,
you'll understand.

32:49.202 --> 32:53.798
From that day on, I never felt
the same about the Yankees.

33:14.061 --> 33:16.621
I started spending a lot
of time with Sonny.

33:18.398 --> 33:22.459
I would come home from school
and sneak away any chance I got.

33:22.536 --> 33:25.061
I would serve the guys drinks and coffee
for tips.

33:25.138 --> 33:27.902
- Bet!
- I'll lay a hundred.

33:34.548 --> 33:36.311
Come on, Sonny!

33:37.784 --> 33:39.615
- Son of a bitch!
- I don't believe it!

33:39.686 --> 33:41.415
I should break his arm.

33:42.155 --> 33:44.487
Here, kid, this is for you.

33:44.558 --> 33:48.790
- Loan me a hundred.
- You know what's gonna happen!

33:48.862 --> 33:51.092
- I feel it! Please!
- Give him a hundred.

33:51.164 --> 33:54.622
- I'm in, I'm in!
- Go ahead. Give him the dice.

33:54.701 --> 33:56.259
- Give him the dice.
- I'm in!

33:56.336 --> 33:59.203
- It's fucking hot.
- Come on, Mush, make a donation.

33:59.272 --> 34:02.673
- Get this over with, Mush.
- Come on, dice.

34:02.742 --> 34:06.974
Baby needs a new pair of shoes.
Come on, seven!

34:07.047 --> 34:09.208
Come on! Come on, dice!

34:10.150 --> 34:12.777
- And seven!
- I don't even have to look.

34:12.853 --> 34:15.947
- Craps! I'm out!
- Get out of here.

34:17.556 --> 34:21.550
- Get him out of here!
- Man never hit a number in his life!

34:23.130 --> 34:25.257
Bring the dice up here.

34:25.331 --> 34:26.094
Where's the kid?

34:27.199 --> 34:31.569
- Put this coffee on my tab?
- Yeah. Get the fuck out of here.

34:31.638 --> 34:35.699
Where's the kid? The kid's
gonna throw the dice for me.

34:35.775 --> 34:38.608
Sonny, don't let this kid
throw the dice!

34:38.678 --> 34:42.011
- Anybody got a problem with that?
- No problem.

34:44.518 --> 34:47.112
I want you to throw the dice for me.

34:47.187 --> 34:49.655
- I don't know how to play.
- You don't have to know.

34:49.723 --> 34:52.817
You just listen to me.
Hear what I said?

34:52.893 --> 34:55.418
Put 500 down on the kid.

34:55.495 --> 34:57.486
I got a hundred!

35:05.372 --> 35:08.466
Can you stop fucking
leaning on me, please?

35:08.542 --> 35:11.443
- You're breathing all over me.
- Hey, JoJo, relax!

35:11.511 --> 35:14.105
I'm trying to get a bet in.
I wanna play too!

35:15.215 --> 35:18.378
You got to hit the wall, kid.
You can do it. Hit the wall.

35:18.451 --> 35:20.419
- You can do it.
- Wait!

35:21.988 --> 35:23.421
I'm betting on Sonny.

35:23.490 --> 35:25.754
I don't want your money
touching mine.

35:25.825 --> 35:30.125
What, it's counterfeit?
My money's no good no more? Why?

35:30.197 --> 35:32.995
Because you're
a fucking jinx, that's why!

35:33.066 --> 35:36.661
Put him in the bathroom!
Get him out of here!

35:37.771 --> 35:42.140
Get in there,
you fucking loser mutt!

35:42.209 --> 35:43.699
Leave him in there!

35:45.612 --> 35:47.443
- A fucking jinx!
- Shoot the dice.

35:48.748 --> 35:50.477
That's a lot of money on you.
Come on.

35:50.550 --> 35:53.576
- Roll a seven. Come on.
- Shoot the fucking dice.

35:55.488 --> 35:56.921
Seven!

36:00.560 --> 36:02.755
Bring the dice up.
Put $1,000 on seven.

36:10.870 --> 36:12.963
You can do it, all right?

36:13.039 --> 36:14.301
You...

36:14.374 --> 36:17.605
Stop fucking breathing on me!
You're killing me over here!

36:17.677 --> 36:20.737
I'm on a win streak.
Stop breathing on me!

36:20.814 --> 36:23.749
- Put him in the bathroom.
- Eddie's in there. He won't fit.

36:23.817 --> 36:27.309
I don't give a fuck!
Put him in there!

36:37.063 --> 36:39.327
Give me a another seven.

36:39.399 --> 36:41.560
Shoot the fucking dice!
Come on!

36:43.169 --> 36:46.468
We got a four! That's all right.

36:46.539 --> 36:48.029
Four's what we got.

36:48.108 --> 36:51.669
- Let's go! Shoot the dice!
- Give the kid another shot!

36:51.745 --> 36:54.680
What's wrong with this money?
What, is he crazy?

36:54.748 --> 36:55.942
Is it counterfeit?

36:57.584 --> 37:00.280
I say the kid makes the four.
Give me $500.

37:00.353 --> 37:01.877
Get your bets down.

37:01.955 --> 37:06.221
- Twenty-two on the hard four.
- I'll lay a hundred.

37:06.293 --> 37:09.023
- Who wants a gag on the four?
- One-forty, no gag.

37:09.095 --> 37:10.722
Put it down.

37:10.797 --> 37:13.960
- I say he makes the hard four.
- He'll never make it.

37:14.034 --> 37:17.470
- Come on. You can do it.
- Don't worry. I'll throw a seven.

37:17.537 --> 37:19.698
- No seven!
- Yeah! Hit a seven!

37:19.773 --> 37:22.298
- Shut up!
- Quiet!

37:22.375 --> 37:27.074
- Do you believe this kid?
- Nobody laughs at this kid.

37:27.147 --> 37:28.876
Seven's are not good now.

37:28.948 --> 37:30.916
- Hit the wall.
- Get a four.

37:30.984 --> 37:33.214
Make the point.
You can do it.

37:36.056 --> 37:37.785
Frankie Coffeecake, no good.

37:37.857 --> 37:40.758
I don't want his face looking
at that face when he's throwing dice.

37:41.761 --> 37:44.559
Jimmy, get a towel from the bar.
Put it over his head.

37:44.631 --> 37:47.429
I don't want a towel over
my head. It's embarrassing.

37:47.500 --> 37:49.934
Put him in the fucking bathroom.

37:50.003 --> 37:52.369
Wait a minute. I got money here!

37:53.440 --> 37:55.431
Get the fuck out of here!

37:55.508 --> 37:57.669
- Get him the fuck out!
- Put him in the bathroom.

37:57.744 --> 37:59.268
Get over here.

38:01.281 --> 38:05.445
- Rat bastard locks us in here.
- Very degrading.

38:05.518 --> 38:07.486
I need that point. Listen!

38:07.554 --> 38:10.785
See that money over there?
See that money?

38:10.857 --> 38:14.384
Are we going to make this point?
Come on. Attaboy!

38:14.461 --> 38:17.897
- Come on!
- I need a 2-2 on the hard four.

38:17.964 --> 38:20.626
Hey, don't get cocky, kid!

38:20.700 --> 38:22.065
Fucking kid.

38:22.135 --> 38:24.603
Just make the point. Go ahead.

38:26.239 --> 38:28.503
I don't fucking believe it!
He did it!

38:30.009 --> 38:32.978
Eleven. I made eleven
passes in a row.

38:35.615 --> 38:38.880
I don't know how much money
Sonny won, but it was a lot.

38:44.391 --> 38:46.621
He said the working man
was a sucker...

38:46.693 --> 38:50.254
and I was at the best school:
the University of Belmont Ave.

38:50.330 --> 38:54.323
I was getting two educations:
from the street and from school.

38:54.401 --> 38:57.336
That way I'd be twice as smart
as everybody.

39:10.750 --> 39:13.719
Hey, kid, you did good.

39:13.787 --> 39:15.914
- Thanks.
- Here.

39:18.324 --> 39:19.757
That's it?

39:21.428 --> 39:22.861
Here.

39:24.364 --> 39:26.264
All right?

39:27.100 --> 39:30.194
- Go home. It's getting late.
- See you later.

39:34.607 --> 39:36.541
Listen.

39:38.044 --> 39:40.035
We got to fix your name.

39:41.514 --> 39:43.379
From now on, you're C.

39:43.450 --> 39:45.680
- C?
- That's right. C.

39:45.752 --> 39:47.379
Go home.

39:47.454 --> 39:49.854
So long, Sonny.

39:49.989 --> 39:53.447
Sonny took me everywhere
and introduced me as his boy.

39:53.526 --> 39:56.324
I noticed strange things started
happening in the neighborhood.

39:56.396 --> 40:00.833
Hey, Calogero, come on over.
I want to talk to you.

40:02.936 --> 40:04.369
My name is C.

40:05.205 --> 40:07.673
I mean C.

40:07.740 --> 40:11.176
- How are you today, my boy?
- Good.

40:11.244 --> 40:13.712
I got nice peaches
for your mom.

40:13.780 --> 40:15.941
I don't have any money.

40:16.015 --> 40:18.415
You don't need no money
with me, kid.

40:19.252 --> 40:21.686
Don't embarrass me
like that again.

40:23.356 --> 40:26.792
Just tell Sonny
that I took care of you.

40:32.365 --> 40:37.234
I saw it was because of Sonny
that everyone was being so nice.

40:37.303 --> 40:40.466
I liked it.
I liked it a lot.

40:45.478 --> 40:48.675
Mommy, look what I got.
Some peaches for...

40:49.282 --> 40:50.715
free.

41:00.260 --> 41:02.888
- What's this?
- What's what, Dad?

41:02.962 --> 41:06.261
Where did you get this? Your mother
found this behind your drawer.

41:06.866 --> 41:08.458
I've been saving.

41:08.535 --> 41:11.936
$600? Did you become
a brain surgeon overnight, son?

41:12.539 --> 41:14.336
Tell your father
where you got the money.

41:14.407 --> 41:16.898
- I worked for it.
- Doing what?

41:16.976 --> 41:20.707
- Things.
- "Things"? What do you mean?

41:20.780 --> 41:22.748
Oh, things. You know, things.

41:23.816 --> 41:27.217
Don't lie. Just tell the truth
and I won't get upset.

41:28.187 --> 41:31.315
- Promise?
- Would I say it if I didn't mean it?

41:33.626 --> 41:35.787
I work the crap games for tips.

41:35.862 --> 41:37.796
- Crap games?
- What crap games?

41:38.698 --> 41:40.427
What crap games?
What tips?

41:41.334 --> 41:44.599
- What crap games?
- You said you wouldn't get mad.

41:44.671 --> 41:46.036
I lied. Tell me.

41:46.105 --> 41:49.336
- I work for Sonny for tips.
- I knew it.

41:49.409 --> 41:52.901
Weren't you told
not to go near that bar?

41:52.979 --> 41:55.004
- But I worked for it.
- What do you mean?

41:55.081 --> 41:57.345
- You're not supposed to go there!
- I'm taking it back.

41:57.417 --> 42:00.284
- I'm bringing it back to the bar.
- Let's just think about it for a minute.

42:00.353 --> 42:03.288
- What are you saying?
- We could use the money.

42:03.356 --> 42:05.085
It's not like
he had to do something bad.

42:05.158 --> 42:08.958
You know where this comes from. I don't
want him having that kind of money!

42:09.028 --> 42:11.792
- Let's just think about it...
- That's it!

42:11.864 --> 42:14.264
- Come on.
- Wait a minute. Listen to me.

42:15.902 --> 42:20.168
Why do you got to go down
like this? Calm down!

42:20.239 --> 42:22.799
Lorenzo, please!

42:22.875 --> 42:24.809
I don't believe this!

42:43.296 --> 42:46.459
- Is Sonny around?
- I think he's in the back.

42:57.610 --> 42:59.134
We can't accept that.

42:59.879 --> 43:02.143
Your son worked for it.

43:02.215 --> 43:05.275
Right. My son. I don't want him
involved in what goes on here.

43:05.351 --> 43:07.251
Involved in what?

43:07.320 --> 43:10.221
Please, I'm not a stupid man.

43:10.289 --> 43:14.589
- Just stay away from my son.
- Hey, you stay right over here.

43:14.661 --> 43:16.424
C, go outside.

43:16.496 --> 43:20.432
I'll speak to my own son.
Calogero, wait outside.

43:22.735 --> 43:25.431
First, I respect you, Lorenzo.
You're a stand-up guy.

43:25.505 --> 43:28.770
But don't ever talk to me
like that again.

43:28.841 --> 43:31.105
I tell your son
to go to school...

43:31.177 --> 43:35.614
It's not what you say, it's what
he sees... clothes, cars, money.

43:36.482 --> 43:38.416
He threw away
his baseball cards...

43:38.484 --> 43:40.975
because Mickey Mantle
would never pay my rent.

43:41.054 --> 43:43.716
He said that?
I don't believe this kid.

43:43.790 --> 43:48.090
That's not funny when he has
a bigger bank account than I do.

43:48.161 --> 43:50.288
I offered you work.
You said no.

43:50.363 --> 43:53.730
And I say no now.
Just leave my son alone.

43:53.800 --> 43:57.429
Don't you see I treat that kid
like he's my son?

43:57.503 --> 44:00.734
He ain't your son.
He's my son!

44:00.807 --> 44:02.866
- Get out!
- I'm not afraid of you.

44:02.942 --> 44:05.240
- You should be.
- I know what you can do.

44:05.311 --> 44:08.610
And I would never
step out of line.

44:08.681 --> 44:12.082
But this time you're wrong.
This is my son, not yours!

44:12.151 --> 44:15.951
You want to fight? Get out or
I'll give you a fucking slap!

44:16.022 --> 44:17.956
Stay away from my son!

44:18.024 --> 44:20.652
- I don't care who you are!
- Get out of here!

44:21.728 --> 44:24.219
- Where's my money?
- It's in there.

44:24.297 --> 44:26.094
It was mine!

44:26.165 --> 44:28.793
That's bad money!
You can't have it.

44:28.868 --> 44:31.894
- I earned that money!
- Stay away from him!

44:31.971 --> 44:34.462
- Please listen!
- Stay away from him!

44:34.540 --> 44:38.135
- Dad, listen to me!
- Did you hear me? Stay away!

44:38.211 --> 44:42.147
Sonny was right.
The working man is a sucker.

44:42.215 --> 44:44.479
Wrong! Pulling a trigger
doesn't take strength.

44:44.550 --> 44:48.748
Get up every day and work for a
living! Let's see him try that!

44:48.821 --> 44:51.847
We'll see who's really tough.
The working man is tough.

44:51.924 --> 44:54.188
Your father's the tough guy!

44:54.260 --> 44:57.252
Everybody loves him, just like
everybody loves you on the bus.

44:57.330 --> 45:00.959
No, it's not the same. People
don't love him. They fear him.

45:01.033 --> 45:02.898
There's a difference.

45:05.271 --> 45:07.205
- I'm sorry.
- I don't understand, Dad.

45:07.273 --> 45:10.868
You will.
You will when you get older.

45:12.612 --> 45:14.546
I'm sorry I hit you.

45:39.105 --> 45:42.836
- Should I take care of him?
- No, leave him alone.

45:44.677 --> 45:47.874
Sonny and my father never
spoke to each other again.

45:47.947 --> 45:51.314
I never listened to my father
about staying away from him.

45:51.384 --> 45:55.184
The bar was so close.
I'd sneak away any chance I got.

45:55.254 --> 45:59.850
Eight years passed, and
as I grew, Sonny grew in power.

45:59.926 --> 46:03.020
He became a boss,
and I was his friend.

46:20.479 --> 46:22.504
Dion was topping the charts.

46:22.582 --> 46:24.777
The Beatles were changing
our life-styles.

46:24.851 --> 46:28.150
The Yankees were in last place
and I didn't give a shit.

46:28.221 --> 46:31.987
There was change everywhere, but
my neighborhood was the same.

46:33.226 --> 46:37.253
They're off! Kryptonite
comes first from the gate!

46:37.330 --> 46:40.857
- On the outside...
- Here's the kid! We're in!

46:40.933 --> 46:44.630
- C! You get it in?
- Yeah. It's all on Kryptonite.

46:44.704 --> 46:47.867
- You hold them.
- Look at this horse go.

46:47.940 --> 46:50.909
- Come on. Take it home!
- Look at this one move!

46:50.977 --> 46:55.107
- This horse can't lose!
- You can do it, Kryptonite!

46:55.181 --> 46:58.981
It's a lock. Don't even worry
about it. We can't lose.

46:59.051 --> 47:03.044
I'm not even going to look
because I know we can't lose.

47:03.122 --> 47:06.421
- Look! He's pulling away!
- Come on, Kryptonite!

47:06.492 --> 47:08.517
Come on, Kryptonite!
Look at him!

47:08.594 --> 47:10.994
Forget it. It's over.
It's all over.

47:11.063 --> 47:12.894
Let's go!

47:12.965 --> 47:16.401
- That's it, Kryptonite!
- Come on, Kryptonite!

47:16.469 --> 47:19.802
Bring me luck!
Come on. Bring me luck!

47:19.872 --> 47:22.363
Come on, Kryptonite!
Hang in there!

47:22.441 --> 47:24.841
- Oh, shit!
- Come on! Let's go!

47:24.911 --> 47:28.005
Get the...
He bet the fucking horse?

47:28.080 --> 47:30.742
He bet Kryptonite?
Give me the tickets.

47:30.816 --> 47:32.340
But, Sonny, we're winning.

47:32.418 --> 47:37.253
We can't win. The Mush
bet Kryptonite. Fucking jinx!

47:37.323 --> 47:40.759
- We're five lengths in the lead.
- Come on. We've been "mushed."

47:40.826 --> 47:43.886
Come on. I got to get away
from this fucking jinx.

47:43.963 --> 47:46.989
- Come on, one!
- Fucking jinx!

47:47.066 --> 47:49.091
Come on. You can still do it!

47:49.168 --> 47:52.160
Come on, Kryptonite.
You can still do it!

47:52.238 --> 47:56.197
- Hang in there!
- Come on. Take it home!

47:56.275 --> 47:58.641
Hang in there!

48:01.147 --> 48:02.944
Shit!

48:03.015 --> 48:07.349
- Fuck! This fucking close!
- I don't believe I lost!

48:07.420 --> 48:09.149
I don't fucking believe it!

48:09.221 --> 48:12.190
Hey, C, I got a tip
in the next race for you.

48:12.258 --> 48:14.249
Go fuck yourself!

48:15.194 --> 48:17.128
You're very emotional.

48:20.199 --> 48:23.691
White Birch wins it
in an absolute shocker!

48:35.281 --> 48:38.182
We finally got our own
social club.

48:38.250 --> 48:40.184
We called it the Deuces Wild.

48:40.252 --> 48:44.018
Drinks were a buck
and the jukebox paid the rent.

48:44.090 --> 48:46.024
We only cared
about hanging out.

48:47.193 --> 48:49.923
We would cut class
and hang out all day and night.

48:49.996 --> 48:51.793
Nobody wanted to go home...

48:51.864 --> 48:55.561
because you might leave and find
out later you missed something.

49:00.239 --> 49:04.175
Whoa, look at those broads
over there. They're beautiful!

49:17.023 --> 49:19.753
Yo, get over here!
Come here!

49:19.825 --> 49:22.521
Put it back in your pants.

49:22.595 --> 49:25.428
- Those broads are both pigs.
- How do you know?

49:25.498 --> 49:28.490
- Fuck you, C.
- How the hell do you know?

49:28.567 --> 49:32.025
- They'd fail my test fast.
- What test?

49:32.104 --> 49:36.768
If you want to marry a girl,
she's got to pass the test.

49:36.842 --> 49:40.710
- I call it the Mario test.
- This I got to hear.

49:40.780 --> 49:44.546
The test is, you take a girl
for a ride in your car.

49:44.617 --> 49:49.486
You pull up to one of them big
18-wheelers on the highway.

49:49.555 --> 49:52.319
You pull alongside it
and get the driver's attention.

49:52.391 --> 49:56.259
Honk your horn. Make sure
he's looking. That's important.

49:56.328 --> 49:59.320
At the same time, put your hand
behind this broad's head...

49:59.398 --> 50:02.162
and push her head down
between your legs.

50:02.234 --> 50:06.193
- Get the fuck out of here.
- It's for her own good.

50:06.272 --> 50:09.207
Now, if this girl
goes down on you...

50:09.275 --> 50:11.675
knowing that truck driver
is watching...

50:11.744 --> 50:14.269
then she's a pig
who can't be trusted.

50:14.346 --> 50:16.246
You're a sick maniac.

50:16.315 --> 50:20.479
When they're into it, they
throw their hair over their ear.

50:20.553 --> 50:23.920
They did it before. Believe me,
they're fucking pros.

50:39.438 --> 50:42.930
That's the second time
those niggers passed today.

50:43.008 --> 50:47.809
- Who gives a fuck?
- I give a fuck, that's who.

50:47.880 --> 50:50.474
Did they bother you? No.

50:50.549 --> 50:53.882
Today it's one car, then two,
then it's their neighborhood!

50:53.953 --> 50:57.582
- Then they'll fuck our broads.
- They shouldn't be here. Period.

50:57.656 --> 51:00.284
Invite them in.
Make them have a drink.

51:00.359 --> 51:02.418
Smash their fucking heads.

51:02.495 --> 51:05.521
You want a shot?
Take one. Come back!

51:08.701 --> 51:11.431
Louie? Dumps! Get over here!
Where's my money?

51:11.504 --> 51:13.972
I got to do that thing.
I can't...

51:14.039 --> 51:18.169
This guy owes me 20 bucks.
It's been two fucking weeks.

51:18.244 --> 51:20.178
You can't dodge me forever!

51:21.080 --> 51:22.809
Fucking piece of shit.

51:32.825 --> 51:34.725
I'll be right back.

51:34.793 --> 51:37.887
- All right, I'll see you.
- Come back.

51:44.737 --> 51:46.705
Take a ride with me.

51:46.772 --> 51:49.639
- Do I have to?
- Yeah, you have to. Come on.

51:57.116 --> 51:58.947
Sit over here.

52:07.393 --> 52:10.157
This music
gives me a headache.

52:10.229 --> 52:13.494
You kids today don't even know
what good music is.

52:13.566 --> 52:15.363
This is good music.

52:23.175 --> 52:26.110
Want to go to the fights
with me tomorrow?

52:32.785 --> 52:34.514
You listening to me?

52:37.823 --> 52:40.189
Can't you call me C?
Everybody does.

52:40.259 --> 52:42.955
Calogero was your grandfather's
name, the name I gave you.

52:43.028 --> 52:45.963
That's why I can't call you
C or whatever it is.

52:49.368 --> 52:51.302
Want to go to the fights?

52:52.471 --> 52:56.464
- Could I let you know tomorrow?
- Do you want to go or not?

52:57.376 --> 53:00.573
- All right, I'll go.
- Don't say it like that.

53:00.646 --> 53:04.582
Don't want to twist your arm.
Don't do me a favor.

54:09.515 --> 54:12.211
She was tall,
she was beautiful...

54:12.284 --> 54:14.115
and she was classy.

54:14.186 --> 54:16.381
But she was black.

54:18.891 --> 54:21.826
And that was a no-no
in my neighborhood.

54:40.546 --> 54:44.141
- Jackie, what's the first?
- 2:00, fellas.

54:44.216 --> 54:47.117
- Two. Your friend's number.
- Who?

54:47.186 --> 54:49.780
- Your pal.
- Don't fuck around.

54:49.855 --> 54:52.119
- Johnny Biscord bet 228 again?
- That's it.

54:52.191 --> 54:53.658
- Again?
- Again.

54:54.426 --> 54:56.519
I'll have better music
next time.

54:57.930 --> 55:00.364
I'm only kidding.
It's okay, Pop.

55:04.670 --> 55:06.433
See you later.

55:26.425 --> 55:29.656
- Louie!
- My grandmother's sick.

55:29.728 --> 55:33.095
I'll talk to you later.
I got to go do something.

55:33.165 --> 55:34.655
Where's my fucking money?

55:37.269 --> 55:40.727
- You're dead, you piece of shit!
- C, come here!

55:42.007 --> 55:44.475
- Get over here.
- He's fucking crazy, this kid.

55:44.543 --> 55:47.808
The kid wants his fucking money.
What can you do?

55:47.880 --> 55:51.509
- I got to talk to him.
- You gotta stop babying him.

55:53.185 --> 55:54.652
He owes me money.

55:54.720 --> 55:58.281
- Hit him with a fucking bat.
- Knock him all over the block.

55:58.357 --> 56:02.123
Is that the advice you give
the kid, you fucking hoodlums?

56:02.194 --> 56:04.992
Come on. Don't listen
to these hoodlums.

56:06.265 --> 56:09.132
I'm going to Gino's.
I'll be back.

56:09.701 --> 56:11.430
What's the matter?

56:11.503 --> 56:13.869
This Louie Dumps
owes me 20 dollars.

56:13.939 --> 56:18.342
It's been two weeks, and whenever
he sees me he keeps dodging me.

56:18.410 --> 56:21.868
He's becoming a pain in the ass.
Should I crack him one?

56:21.947 --> 56:24.780
What's the matter?
What have I been telling you?

56:24.850 --> 56:27.580
Sometimes hurting somebody
ain't the answer.

56:27.653 --> 56:31.919
- Is he a good friend of yours?
- No, I don't even like him.

56:31.990 --> 56:33.958
There's your answer right there.

56:34.026 --> 56:37.018
It costs you 20 dollars
to get rid of him.

56:37.095 --> 56:40.997
He's never bother you again. He's never
gonna ask you for money again.

56:41.066 --> 56:44.001
He's out of your life for
20 dollars. You got off cheap.

56:44.069 --> 56:46.003
You're always right.

56:46.071 --> 56:50.337
If I was, I wouldn't have
done 10 years in the joint.

56:50.409 --> 56:52.502
What did you do every day?

56:52.578 --> 56:55.046
There's only three things
to do in the joint, kid:

56:55.113 --> 56:57.604
lift weights, play cards
or get into trouble.

56:57.683 --> 57:00.345
- What did you do?
- Me? I read.

57:01.453 --> 57:02.886
What did you read?

57:03.622 --> 57:06.489
- Ever hear of Machiavelli?
- Who?

57:06.558 --> 57:09.425
He's a famous writer
from 500 years ago.

57:09.495 --> 57:11.793
Availability.
That's what he always said.

57:11.864 --> 57:14.992
- Availability?
- That's right. Listen to me.

57:16.034 --> 57:19.003
You know why I live
in this neighborhood?

57:19.071 --> 57:20.470
Availability.

57:20.539 --> 57:22.905
I want to stay close
to everything...

57:22.975 --> 57:25.876
because being on the spot,
I can see trouble immediately.

57:25.944 --> 57:28.913
Trouble is like a cancer.
You got to get it early.

57:28.981 --> 57:31.472
Otherwise it gets big
and kills you.

57:31.550 --> 57:33.381
You got to cut it out.

57:36.455 --> 57:38.480
You're worried about
Louie Dumps.

57:38.557 --> 57:40.491
Nobody cares.

57:42.494 --> 57:46.396
Worry about yourself, your family,
the people that are important to you.

57:46.465 --> 57:49.298
That's what it comes down to:
availability.

57:49.368 --> 57:53.236
The people that see me every day
that are on my side...

57:53.305 --> 57:56.069
they feel safe
because they know I'm close.

57:56.141 --> 57:58.905
That gives them
more reason to love me.

57:58.977 --> 58:02.640
The people that want to do otherwise,
they think twice...

58:02.714 --> 58:04.477
because they know I'm close.

58:04.550 --> 58:06.916
That gives them
more reason to fear me.

58:06.985 --> 58:09.317
Is it better
to be loved or feared?

58:10.756 --> 58:12.781
That's a good question.

58:12.858 --> 58:15.452
It's nice to be both,
but it's difficult.

58:15.527 --> 58:17.757
But if I had my choice...

58:17.829 --> 58:19.888
I would rather be feared.

58:21.233 --> 58:23.394
Fear lasts longer than love.

58:23.468 --> 58:25.868
Friendships bought with money
mean nothing.

58:25.938 --> 58:28.998
You see how it is.
I make a joke, everybody laughs.

58:29.074 --> 58:31.065
I'm funny, but not that funny.

58:32.477 --> 58:36.311
Fear keeps them loyal to me.
The trick is not being hated.

58:37.082 --> 58:41.348
I treat my men good. But if I
give too much, I'm not needed.

58:41.420 --> 58:44.514
I give just enough where they need me
but don't hate me.

58:46.158 --> 58:48.183
Don't forget what I'm telling you.

58:50.195 --> 58:53.426
Sonny, I got some
beautiful veal chops today.

58:53.498 --> 58:56.092
I got some nice linguine...

58:56.168 --> 58:59.433
and I got
some beautiful sauce.

59:42.080 --> 59:44.344
You're not dressed properly.
You'll have to leave.

59:44.416 --> 59:46.577
What's wrong
with how we're dressed?

59:46.652 --> 59:49.712
These gentlemen ain't dressed
right. I asked them to leave.

59:49.788 --> 59:51.722
Is there a problem?

59:51.790 --> 59:56.090
He's acting like our money ain't
green. We just want some beers.

59:56.161 --> 59:58.095
A few beers, that's it?

59:58.163 --> 01:00:02.099
That's it. We'll be on our way.
We ain't looking for trouble.

01:00:02.167 --> 01:00:04.226
Spoken like a gentleman.
Give them their beers.

01:00:04.302 --> 01:00:05.997
- I appreciate that.
- No problem.

01:00:10.409 --> 01:00:12.343
Here you go.

01:00:12.411 --> 01:00:15.005
You got some brews down here?
Nice cold ones.

01:00:17.416 --> 01:00:18.849
Two over here, huh?

01:00:21.687 --> 01:00:25.953
One more beer.
Got some thirsty people here.

01:00:26.024 --> 01:00:30.393
All right, brothers.
If I may, a toast to our host.

01:00:30.462 --> 01:00:33.863
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost!

01:00:33.932 --> 01:00:36.162
Get wet, you dago wop!

01:00:36.234 --> 01:00:39.135
Look at all this shit
all over me!

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:44.074
Oh, you again, huh?

01:00:44.142 --> 01:00:46.702
That wasn't very nice.
Now you got to leave.

01:00:46.778 --> 01:00:49.747
I'll tell you when the fuck
we leave. Get away from me.

01:00:54.052 --> 01:00:56.543
Hey, watch the bikes, man.

01:00:56.621 --> 01:01:00.148
- What's going on here?
- Come on!

01:01:03.595 --> 01:01:06.359
- This is half empty.
- What's this shit?

01:01:06.431 --> 01:01:08.763
What's going on here?

01:01:11.937 --> 01:01:13.404
Now you can't leave.

01:01:14.473 --> 01:01:17.135
I will never forget
the look on their faces.

01:01:17.209 --> 01:01:21.236
All eight of them.
Their faces dropped.

01:01:21.313 --> 01:01:23.941
All their courage and strength
was drained from their bodies.

01:01:25.917 --> 01:01:28.943
They had a reputation
for breaking up bars.

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:32.183
But they knew that instant
they made a fatal mistake.

01:01:32.257 --> 01:01:33.986
This time, they walked
into the wrong bar.

01:01:34.059 --> 01:01:36.391
Come on, motherfucker!

01:01:57.215 --> 01:01:59.046
Crack his fucking head open!

01:02:18.203 --> 01:02:20.262
You fucking creep!

01:02:36.154 --> 01:02:37.951
Step on his head!

01:02:40.692 --> 01:02:43.354
Get them out of here!

01:02:43.428 --> 01:02:45.862
Drag them the fuck out!
Move it!

01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:56.568
Watch my car!

01:03:03.682 --> 01:03:05.343
Fucking punks!

01:03:06.718 --> 01:03:09.312
Get him!
Grab that hairy bastard!

01:03:09.387 --> 01:03:10.820
Let the kids kill them.

01:03:10.889 --> 01:03:14.484
- Hit him!
- Get away!

01:03:17.395 --> 01:03:19.329
Kick him in his face!

01:03:19.397 --> 01:03:20.864
Here, you motherfucker!

01:03:21.933 --> 01:03:23.491
Look at me.

01:03:23.568 --> 01:03:26.799
I'm the one who did this
to you. Remember me.

01:03:29.441 --> 01:03:32.035
Come on, Sonny!
Let's go, you guys!

01:03:33.745 --> 01:03:37.909
- They ruined my lunch!
- Let's get out of here!

01:03:40.452 --> 01:03:42.886
Leave them there
like the dogs that they are.

01:03:46.858 --> 01:03:49.349
They ruined my whole
fucking lunch! Come on!

01:04:05.153 --> 01:04:07.519
Take a look at this gun
right here.

01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:09.318
It's a.45.

01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:11.881
This thing could stop
an elephant driving a truck...

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:13.427
and the truck too.

01:04:13.494 --> 01:04:15.587
Nicky Zero
was the neighborhood thief.

01:04:15.663 --> 01:04:18.598
His mother called him Zero. She
said he'd never amount to nothing.

01:04:18.666 --> 01:04:20.600
It's too big.
Where will you hide it?

01:04:20.668 --> 01:04:23.728
- Then you want this one.
- They can spot that.

01:04:24.973 --> 01:04:27.806
- You need this.
- What is wrong with you?

01:04:27.876 --> 01:04:29.275
Don't point the gun.

01:04:29.344 --> 01:04:31.608
It's on safety.
I won't kill you.

01:04:31.679 --> 01:04:35.115
Don't ever do that.
Now let me see the fucking gun.

01:04:35.183 --> 01:04:39.085
- This is you. This is class.
- I don't know.

01:04:39.153 --> 01:04:42.088
- What's this?
- Let me see this.

01:04:43.224 --> 01:04:44.691
Feels nice.

01:04:44.759 --> 01:04:46.226
Right there. Feel it.

01:04:46.294 --> 01:04:49.058
I wanna shoot somebody,
you know what I mean?

01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:52.258
I wanna shoot somebody too.
That's the gun for it.

01:04:52.333 --> 01:04:54.392
- What are you guys doing?
- You think so?

01:04:54.469 --> 01:04:57.802
What's going on?
Are you stupid or something?

01:04:57.872 --> 01:04:59.999
Are you fucking stupid
or something?

01:05:00.074 --> 01:05:03.339
What's the matter with you,
selling guns around here?

01:05:03.411 --> 01:05:06.812
You'll make this whole place hot
and get us all fucking pinched.

01:05:06.881 --> 01:05:08.473
Get out of here!

01:05:10.418 --> 01:05:13.285
Stay over here. Don't move.
All of you. Stay right there.

01:05:13.354 --> 01:05:16.721
I want no guns. You hear me?
Get out of here!

01:05:16.791 --> 01:05:18.918
C, get over here!

01:05:18.993 --> 01:05:20.927
Come here.
I want to talk to you.

01:05:28.903 --> 01:05:31.895
- Sonny, loan me 500.
- Tomorrow.

01:05:38.413 --> 01:05:41.746
You think you're a tough guy
with these guns, is that it?

01:05:41.816 --> 01:05:44.080
No, but after what happened
in the bar, I thought...

01:05:44.152 --> 01:05:46.916
You think a gun
makes you a tough guy?

01:05:46.988 --> 01:05:50.685
I seen more guys with guns
wet the bed than anything.

01:05:50.758 --> 01:05:52.817
It's when the other guy
pulls out his gun.

01:05:52.894 --> 01:05:54.828
Then we see
who the tough guy is.

01:05:54.896 --> 01:05:56.386
You don't understand.

01:05:56.464 --> 01:05:58.455
I do understand.
This shit is not for you.

01:05:58.533 --> 01:06:00.467
Those kids are gonna
get you in trouble.

01:06:00.535 --> 01:06:02.366
But they're my friends.
You know that.

01:06:02.437 --> 01:06:04.530
They're jerk-offs.

01:06:04.605 --> 01:06:06.505
Look at me.

01:06:06.574 --> 01:06:08.166
Jerk-offs.

01:06:08.242 --> 01:06:10.676
And Slick is
the biggest jerk-off.

01:06:11.746 --> 01:06:13.304
What have been telling you?

01:06:13.381 --> 01:06:16.407
"Stay in school.
Get two educations." I know.

01:06:16.484 --> 01:06:19.317
That's right.
Don't do what I do.

01:06:19.387 --> 01:06:22.254
This is my life, not yours.

01:06:22.323 --> 01:06:24.655
I do what I have to do.
This is not for you.

01:06:25.727 --> 01:06:27.695
All right. I'm sorry.

01:06:31.799 --> 01:06:34.290
Want to go to the fights
with me tomorrow?

01:06:34.369 --> 01:06:35.836
I don't know.

01:06:35.903 --> 01:06:38.497
I got a piece of
a good middleweight.

01:06:38.573 --> 01:06:40.507
Come with me.
We'll sit in front.

01:06:40.575 --> 01:06:44.341
I would like to come, but I told
my father I would go with him.

01:06:44.412 --> 01:06:47.176
You know where I'm sitting.
Come by and say hello.

01:06:47.248 --> 01:06:50.081
- All right.
- You know where I'm sitting.

01:06:59.794 --> 01:07:01.261
Sit here.

01:07:03.364 --> 01:07:06.026
Nice seats.
I hope I don't get a nosebleed.

01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:08.728
These are the best I can do.
What do you want?

01:07:08.803 --> 01:07:10.293
I'm only kidding.

01:07:40.868 --> 01:07:43.302
Hi, C. How are you doing?
Hello, Lorenzo.

01:07:43.371 --> 01:07:44.804
How are you doing?

01:07:44.872 --> 01:07:49.309
Sonny has a couple of ringside
seats for you. Come on down.

01:07:53.414 --> 01:07:55.939
Tell him thanks,
but we're good where we are.

01:08:00.054 --> 01:08:02.420
Tell Sonny thanks,
but we're good where we are.

01:08:02.490 --> 01:08:05.823
You're welcome to come down.
You know where the seats are.

01:08:05.893 --> 01:08:08.123
Anytime during the fight. Okay?

01:08:08.196 --> 01:08:10.130
Okay. Thanks.

01:08:10.198 --> 01:08:13.292
Introducing the principals
for this evening's main event.

01:08:13.367 --> 01:08:16.359
He's got seats for us.
He's trying to be our friend.

01:08:16.437 --> 01:08:19.372
I like my seat. I paid for it.
You want to go down there, go.

01:08:21.042 --> 01:08:23.272
Go ahead. Go down there.

01:08:23.344 --> 01:08:25.335
Welcome
Eric "The Rock Man" Holland!

01:08:29.517 --> 01:08:31.951
I bring you,
and you want to go with them.

01:08:32.019 --> 01:08:34.010
Go with them.

01:08:34.087 --> 01:08:36.488
You think I want to sit with you
when you want to be with them?

01:08:36.557 --> 01:08:39.048
From the Bronx, New York...

01:08:39.127 --> 01:08:41.652
How do you think
that makes me feel?

01:08:41.729 --> 01:08:43.162
Joe Carey!

01:08:49.136 --> 01:08:51.071
I'm sorry if I hurt you, Dad.

01:09:00.413 --> 01:09:02.279
Everything I've been
telling you.

01:09:20.968 --> 01:09:24.596
He's been avoiding me. When I
see him, I'll break his face.

01:09:24.671 --> 01:09:27.106
- Do you like him?
- He's a jerk-off!

01:09:27.175 --> 01:09:29.643
Ten dollars. You got off cheap.
He's out of your life.

01:09:29.710 --> 01:09:32.577
I'm still going to
fucking break his face.

01:09:39.053 --> 01:09:42.352
I couldn't believe it.
She was right in front of me.

01:09:42.423 --> 01:09:46.120
I never forgot her since I
saw her on my father's bus.

01:09:46.194 --> 01:09:48.219
I wanted to talk to her,
but she was with her friends...

01:09:48.296 --> 01:09:50.229
and I was with mine.

01:09:52.633 --> 01:09:58.367
I only have eyes

01:09:58.439 --> 01:10:03.433
For you

01:10:03.511 --> 01:10:06.878
Dear

01:10:08.416 --> 01:10:12.614
This fucking doo-wop.
I want to strangle one of them.

01:10:15.756 --> 01:10:21.353
My love must be a kind
of blind love

01:10:23.764 --> 01:10:28.895
I can't see anyone but you

01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:32.701
- Let's get something to eat.
- This fat bastard ate it all.

01:10:32.773 --> 01:10:34.707
What's wrong with you?
You're always eating.

01:10:34.775 --> 01:10:38.472
- I was hungry.
- Did you read about the bikers?

01:10:38.546 --> 01:10:40.104
- No.
- I was reading the paper.

01:10:40.181 --> 01:10:43.048
You see the way Jimmy
was hitting them?

01:10:43.117 --> 01:10:46.348
- What about Danny with that pipe?
- I don't know.

01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:48.854
- Let's get out of here.
- You wanna get out of here?

01:10:48.923 --> 01:10:50.857
Come on. Let's go.

01:10:52.093 --> 01:10:53.958
Come on, C.

01:10:54.028 --> 01:10:56.758
- I can't come. I got a test.
- Fuck the test.

01:10:56.831 --> 01:10:58.765
I missed it last week.

01:10:58.833 --> 01:11:02.291
You sure? All right.
We'll be at The Deuces.

01:11:02.370 --> 01:11:07.569
Are the stars out tonight

01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:15.046
I don't know
if it's cloudy or bright

01:11:15.116 --> 01:11:21.055
I only have eyes

01:11:21.122 --> 01:11:26.355
For you

01:11:26.427 --> 01:11:28.361
Dear

01:11:35.936 --> 01:11:39.872
We were alone for the first time.
I knew I had to say something to her.

01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:41.874
This chance
might never come again.

01:11:43.978 --> 01:11:48.039
I wanted to be cool, but I still
didn't even know her name.

01:11:48.115 --> 01:11:50.413
I said to myself, "She must
have an exotic name...

01:11:50.484 --> 01:11:52.076
like Monique or Danielle."

01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:01.325
You go to this school?

01:12:01.395 --> 01:12:03.056
I'm Jane.

01:12:03.998 --> 01:12:07.229
- Jane? That's your name?
- Yeah. What's wrong with that?

01:12:07.301 --> 01:12:09.895
Nothing. It's a great name.
I love that name.

01:12:09.970 --> 01:12:11.995
I just moved here.

01:12:12.073 --> 01:12:14.439
I seen you on the bus
the other day.

01:12:14.508 --> 01:12:16.032
And you are?

01:12:16.110 --> 01:12:17.941
I'm Calogero.

01:12:18.012 --> 01:12:19.445
Ca-who?

01:12:21.315 --> 01:12:23.681
- What kind of name is that?
- It's Italian.

01:12:23.751 --> 01:12:26.845
Actually, it's Sicilian.
My family's from Sicily.

01:12:26.921 --> 01:12:28.616
Sicily?

01:12:28.689 --> 01:12:31.055
You know where Italy is?
It's the boot that comes down.

01:12:31.125 --> 01:12:33.423
The island next to it that looks
like it's getting kicked...

01:12:33.494 --> 01:12:34.927
is Sicily.

01:12:34.995 --> 01:12:37.623
- I like Italians.
- You do?

01:12:40.434 --> 01:12:41.958
Are you waiting for someone?

01:12:42.036 --> 01:12:44.971
- Yes, I am.
- Oh, you are.

01:12:45.039 --> 01:12:47.564
All right.
Well, I better go.

01:12:50.010 --> 01:12:52.035
Wait.

01:12:52.113 --> 01:12:54.047
I was just waiting
for my brother.

01:12:54.115 --> 01:12:56.413
Sometimes we walk home together.

01:12:56.484 --> 01:12:58.952
If it's no problem,
I could walk you home.

01:13:00.221 --> 01:13:02.985
I live down Webster Avenue.
Is that all right?

01:13:04.058 --> 01:13:06.526
That's no problem.
Come on. Let's go.

01:13:08.195 --> 01:13:10.026
So you wait for your brother?

01:13:11.098 --> 01:13:13.828
- That's great.
- What's so great about it?

01:13:13.901 --> 01:13:16.392
What's so great about it?
It's just great.

01:13:19.206 --> 01:13:21.140
Where did you get that hat from?

01:13:21.208 --> 01:13:24.405
- You don't like this hat?
- It's funny-looking.

01:13:24.478 --> 01:13:27.413
Maybe it will look better
another way. Hold this.

01:13:36.924 --> 01:13:38.915
You have beautiful eyes.

01:13:40.428 --> 01:13:42.123
Thanks. So do you.

01:13:47.168 --> 01:13:48.863
That's better.

01:13:50.771 --> 01:13:52.762
Do you want to go to the movies?

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:55.741
You want to go
to the movies with me?

01:13:55.810 --> 01:13:58.335
Yeah. I told you
I liked Italians.

01:13:58.412 --> 01:14:00.710
You want to go right now?

01:14:00.781 --> 01:14:02.646
No, of course not now.

01:14:03.717 --> 01:14:05.651
How about tomorrow?

01:14:05.719 --> 01:14:08.017
6:00. We'll meet in front.

01:14:08.088 --> 01:14:10.488
I'll be waiting here
till tomorrow then.

01:14:14.428 --> 01:14:17.522
Oh, I'm sorry. I mean I'll
meet you in front tomorrow.

01:14:19.066 --> 01:14:21.398
Sorry I'm saying stupid stuff.
I'm so nervous.

01:14:23.170 --> 01:14:26.697
You're not saying stupid things.
You're doing okay.

01:14:26.774 --> 01:14:28.469
You think so?

01:14:29.977 --> 01:14:32.104
Where are you originally from?

01:14:32.179 --> 01:14:34.374
- Brooklyn.
- What part?

01:14:34.448 --> 01:14:36.245
- East New York.
- Where's that?

01:14:36.317 --> 01:14:38.342
It's far. Way out.

01:14:38.419 --> 01:14:41.547
I got relatives in Brooklyn.
I never heard of that part.

01:14:41.622 --> 01:14:43.886
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:14:43.958 --> 01:14:47.325
- I suppose they're Italian too.
- Yeah.

01:14:47.394 --> 01:14:48.827
That figures.

01:14:48.896 --> 01:14:50.864
- What's your last name?
- Williams.

01:14:50.931 --> 01:14:52.922
Very easy. Very simple.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.494
Jane Williams.
That's a pretty easy name to say.

01:14:57.571 --> 01:14:59.664
Can't say mine's that easy.

01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:01.537
Wait. Let me see.

01:15:01.609 --> 01:15:05.409
Calogero Anello?

01:15:05.479 --> 01:15:07.140
- Yeah.
- Got it.

01:15:07.214 --> 01:15:08.909
My friends call me C.

01:15:08.983 --> 01:15:10.974
I like Calogero better.

01:15:14.855 --> 01:15:16.379
These books are heavy.

01:15:17.558 --> 01:15:19.617
That's why I'm glad
you're carrying them.

01:15:52.493 --> 01:15:53.926
Well...

01:15:55.162 --> 01:15:57.027
I guess this is it.

01:15:57.097 --> 01:15:59.964
- I really had a great time.
- Me too.

01:16:01.335 --> 01:16:04.133
- I think you're very nice.
- Thanks. So are you.

01:16:05.139 --> 01:16:06.936
Thank you.

01:16:10.311 --> 01:16:12.245
Sorry I can't walk you
all the way home.

01:16:12.313 --> 01:16:15.248
That's all right.
I only live a block down.

01:16:16.584 --> 01:16:20.076
- I'll see you tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.

01:16:20.154 --> 01:16:22.418
Tomorrow night? 6:00?

01:16:23.223 --> 01:16:24.747
You're getting better.

01:16:24.825 --> 01:16:26.690
I just wanted to double-check.

01:16:28.028 --> 01:16:30.462
Well. Bye.

01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:12.395
What is it, white motherfucker?

01:17:25.219 --> 01:17:26.709
Come on, Aldo.

01:17:30.157 --> 01:17:33.024
That was a late fucking finger.

01:17:33.093 --> 01:17:35.186
Was it late, man? Tell me.

01:17:35.262 --> 01:17:37.355
What are you talking about?

01:17:37.431 --> 01:17:40.366
Go ahead! This fucking kid
keeps winning my money!

01:17:40.434 --> 01:17:43.699
I'm going to curse him now.
He won't win anymore.

01:17:43.771 --> 01:17:46.865
He's got all my money.
How am I going to play?

01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:49.431
He won't win anymore. Watch.

01:17:52.913 --> 01:17:54.608
What the fuck, man?

01:17:56.984 --> 01:17:59.418
These fucking spooks can't ride
in their own neighborhood?

01:17:59.486 --> 01:18:00.953
Just leave them alone.

01:18:01.021 --> 01:18:03.421
What is it with you
and these niggers lately?

01:18:03.490 --> 01:18:06.118
- They ain't bothering nobody.
- They're bothering me.

01:18:06.193 --> 01:18:07.455
Not me.

01:18:13.934 --> 01:18:16.198
This is our neighborhood,
you black bastard!

01:18:20.474 --> 01:18:22.066
Let's get these niggers!

01:18:22.142 --> 01:18:25.043
Get the fuck
out of our neighborhood!

01:18:25.112 --> 01:18:27.273
- Let's get out of here!
- Get him!

01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:34.653
Black bastard!

01:18:41.695 --> 01:18:43.788
C, come here!

01:18:47.334 --> 01:18:48.562
Leave me alone!

01:18:49.970 --> 01:18:52.336
Grab him, C!
Get this motherfucker!

01:18:52.406 --> 01:18:54.067
- Stay down!
- I didn't do anything!

01:18:54.141 --> 01:18:56.803
I won't hurt you. Stay down.
I don't want to hurt you.

01:18:56.877 --> 01:18:58.572
Get him!

01:19:05.018 --> 01:19:06.178
Motherfucker!

01:19:06.253 --> 01:19:09.188
What are you doing,
dancing with him? Get off!

01:19:11.225 --> 01:19:14.490
Get out of here, crazy bastards.
The cops are coming.

01:19:14.561 --> 01:19:16.529
I can see them. Go!

01:19:16.597 --> 01:19:18.997
- I can see the lights.
- Get off him!

01:19:19.066 --> 01:19:22.126
They called the cops! Come one!
Let's go!

01:19:22.202 --> 01:19:23.829
They called the cops!

01:19:23.904 --> 01:19:25.997
What are you doing?

01:19:26.073 --> 01:19:28.371
- You're going to kill him!
- I don't care.

01:19:28.442 --> 01:19:30.433
I want to kill him!

01:19:30.511 --> 01:19:32.342
- The cops are coming!
- Fuck that!

01:19:34.114 --> 01:19:36.048
They called the fucking cops!
Come on!

01:19:47.094 --> 01:19:49.062
Didn't I tell you Slick
was nothing but trouble?

01:19:49.129 --> 01:19:51.222
Yeah, but he's my friend.

01:19:52.566 --> 01:19:54.557
He's your friend.
I'm your friend, kid.

01:19:55.903 --> 01:19:57.928
You're letting yourself
get caught up in this shit.

01:19:58.005 --> 01:19:59.996
These kids could hurt you.
Think for yourself.

01:20:02.409 --> 01:20:05.071
I'm trying,
but we hate these people.

01:20:05.145 --> 01:20:07.079
I don't hate them,
but, you know.

01:20:07.147 --> 01:20:09.877
What people?
What's on your mind?

01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:12.475
- I met this girl.
- Yeah? So?

01:20:12.553 --> 01:20:15.989
I like her and everything,
but she ain't white.

01:20:16.056 --> 01:20:17.580
She's from Webster Avenue.

01:20:17.658 --> 01:20:20.388
- She's a colored girl.
- Yeah.

01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:21.825
You like her?

01:20:21.895 --> 01:20:24.022
I do, but I don't want
to hear the guys.

01:20:24.097 --> 01:20:28.227
Fuck them. Half of them
are gonna end up dead or in jail.

01:20:28.302 --> 01:20:30.236
Nobody cares.

01:20:30.304 --> 01:20:32.431
All that matters
is what's good for you...

01:20:32.506 --> 01:20:34.497
and how you feel
about each other.

01:20:36.276 --> 01:20:38.005
Let me tell you something.

01:20:38.078 --> 01:20:39.739
When you're alone,
late at night in bed...

01:20:39.813 --> 01:20:41.781
just you and her
under the covers...

01:20:41.849 --> 01:20:43.612
that's all that matters.

01:20:43.684 --> 01:20:46.380
You got to do what your heart
tells you to do.

01:20:46.453 --> 01:20:48.614
I'll tell you something.

01:20:48.689 --> 01:20:50.884
You're only allowed three
great women in your lifetime.

01:20:51.992 --> 01:20:55.257
They come along like great
fighters, once every ten years.

01:20:55.329 --> 01:20:58.423
Rocky Marciano.
Sugar Ray Robinson. Joe Louis.

01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:01.565
Sometimes you get them
all at once.

01:21:01.635 --> 01:21:04.763
Me? I had my three
when I was 16. That happens.

01:21:04.838 --> 01:21:07.466
What are you gonna do?

01:21:07.541 --> 01:21:09.202
That's the way it goes, you know?

01:21:09.276 --> 01:21:12.109
Tell you right now.
See this girl?

01:21:13.213 --> 01:21:15.306
Maybe this girl
puts wind in your sails.

01:21:17.818 --> 01:21:19.752
Maybe she's
your first great one.

01:21:19.820 --> 01:21:22.084
Thanks, Sonny.
I think I'll go for it.

01:21:22.155 --> 01:21:26.091
- Is she a good kid?
- I just met her. I hope so.

01:21:26.159 --> 01:21:28.320
Tomorrow you borrow my car.

01:21:28.395 --> 01:21:30.989
- You don't lend it to anybody.
- I'll lend it to you.

01:21:31.064 --> 01:21:32.998
I want you to make
a good impression.

01:21:33.066 --> 01:21:35.296
You borrow my car,
and you give her the test.

01:21:35.369 --> 01:21:37.132
The "Mario test"?

01:21:37.204 --> 01:21:40.367
Mario's a psycho.
Why do you listen to him?

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:42.738
Give her my test,
the door test.

01:21:42.809 --> 01:21:44.800
- What's that?
- Listen to me.

01:21:44.878 --> 01:21:47.369
You pull up
right where she is.

01:21:47.447 --> 01:21:50.439
Before you get out of the car,
lock both doors.

01:21:50.517 --> 01:21:53.577
You get out of the car,
you walk over to her.

01:21:53.654 --> 01:21:55.588
You bring her over to the car.

01:21:55.656 --> 01:21:58.716
You take out the key, unlock it,
open the door for her.

01:21:58.792 --> 01:22:01.556
You let her get in.
Then you close the door for her.

01:22:01.628 --> 01:22:04.654
You walk behind the car and
look through the rear window.

01:22:04.731 --> 01:22:07.325
If she doesn't reach over and
lift up that button for you...

01:22:07.401 --> 01:22:09.335
so you can get in,
dump her.

01:22:09.403 --> 01:22:11.633
- Just like that?
- Listen to me, kid.

01:22:11.705 --> 01:22:14.333
If she doesn't reach over,
lift up that button for you...

01:22:14.408 --> 01:22:18.504
she's a selfish broad and all
you're seeing is the tip of the iceberg.

01:22:18.578 --> 01:22:20.808
You dump her fast.

01:22:20.881 --> 01:22:22.849
What about the beautiful things
you just told me?

01:22:22.916 --> 01:22:24.941
Do what my heart tells me to do.

01:22:25.018 --> 01:22:28.454
Find someone to put wind in my
sails. She could be a great one.

01:22:28.522 --> 01:22:31.013
Bullshit, kid.
The door test is what counts.

01:22:31.091 --> 01:22:33.116
You dump her,
and you dump her fast.

01:22:33.193 --> 01:22:35.525
- Dump her?
- Dump her.

01:22:48.108 --> 01:22:50.804
- Dad. Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

01:22:53.513 --> 01:22:56.243
I need your opinion. You know
Joey Osso from down the block?

01:22:57.617 --> 01:23:00.177
He asked me what I thought
about him dating a colored girl.

01:23:00.253 --> 01:23:03.654
- What do you think?
- Joey can't find white girls?

01:23:03.724 --> 01:23:06.659
That's not a good answer.
What's the problem?

01:23:06.727 --> 01:23:08.661
I get along with everybody
on the bus...

01:23:08.729 --> 01:23:12.256
but when it comes to marriage,
we should marry within our own.

01:23:12.332 --> 01:23:16.268
- You know I'm not prejudiced.
- Don't tell me that. You are.

01:23:16.336 --> 01:23:19.203
What would you say if I wanted
to date a colored girl?

01:23:19.272 --> 01:23:21.035
You would never do that.

01:23:21.108 --> 01:23:23.508
You never know. This girl
might be one of the great ones.

01:23:23.577 --> 01:23:26.944
You're only allowed three
great women in your lifetime.

01:23:27.014 --> 01:23:29.676
- Who told you that?
- Joey Osso.

01:23:34.187 --> 01:23:37.748
You tell him that sometimes
in the heat of passion...

01:23:37.824 --> 01:23:39.951
the little head tells
the big head what to do...

01:23:40.027 --> 01:23:42.120
and that the big head
should think twice about it.

01:23:43.196 --> 01:23:45.187
All right.

01:23:45.265 --> 01:23:46.698
Be careful.

01:25:17.724 --> 01:25:19.817
- You okay?
- No.

01:25:19.893 --> 01:25:22.020
My brother got beat up
in your neighborhood.

01:25:22.095 --> 01:25:23.357
What?

01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:25.728
Yesterday, some Italian guys
beat up my brother...

01:25:25.799 --> 01:25:27.198
in your neighborhood.

01:25:27.267 --> 01:25:30.532
- What's that have to do with me?
- Were you there?

01:25:30.604 --> 01:25:34.404
- No, I wasn't there.
- Please don't lie to me.

01:25:34.474 --> 01:25:36.738
I'm telling you the truth.
I wasn't there.

01:25:36.810 --> 01:25:39.973
We'll see who's lying.
My brother's in the car.

01:25:40.046 --> 01:25:43.174
I told him I was going out with
an Italian, so he came along.

01:25:43.250 --> 01:25:45.844
He recognized you
and said you beat him up.

01:25:45.919 --> 01:25:48.979
- You did that to his face.
- I didn't touch your brother.

01:25:49.055 --> 01:25:50.386
Believe me.

01:25:50.457 --> 01:25:52.448
Okay, we'll see.

01:26:00.867 --> 01:26:02.732
We'll get this straight
right now.

01:26:11.411 --> 01:26:12.969
Yeah, that's him.

01:26:14.915 --> 01:26:16.906
- You did this to me.
- I didn't do anything...

01:26:16.983 --> 01:26:18.575
- Yes, you did!
- I didn't.

01:26:18.652 --> 01:26:20.711
- Are you sure it was him?
- I'm positive!

01:26:20.787 --> 01:26:23.255
Don't believe him.
I didn't touch him.

01:26:23.323 --> 01:26:26.224
- So you were there?
- But I didn't do anything.

01:26:26.293 --> 01:26:29.524
- Believe me.
- You told me you weren't there!

01:26:29.596 --> 01:26:31.621
It was the other guys.
I tried to help him.

01:26:31.698 --> 01:26:34.690
- How did my eye get like this?
- I tried to help you!

01:26:34.768 --> 01:26:37.532
- Bullshit, man!
- You know I didn't do anything.

01:26:37.604 --> 01:26:39.970
- Why were you on top of me?
- It was the others!

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:43.066
- It was you!
- I was the only one helping you.

01:26:43.143 --> 01:26:44.770
This is how you repay me?

01:26:44.844 --> 01:26:46.937
Fuck that! No, fuck you, man!

01:26:47.013 --> 01:26:50.141
I didn't do anything!
Fuck you, you fucking nigger!

01:26:53.987 --> 01:26:57.354
See what I'm talking about?
Just like the rest of them!

01:27:52.712 --> 01:27:54.805
How come you're back so fast?

01:27:54.881 --> 01:27:57.372
The keys are in the car.
I got to go.

01:27:57.450 --> 01:28:00.112
Wait. Come here. What happened?

01:28:00.186 --> 01:28:02.814
It just didn't work out.
I got to go.

01:28:02.889 --> 01:28:05.187
- What happened with the girl?
- Everything went wrong.

01:28:05.258 --> 01:28:07.556
You want to go to the track?

01:28:07.627 --> 01:28:10.528
No. I don't want to talk.
I got to go.

01:28:10.597 --> 01:28:12.189
C, you sure?

01:28:12.265 --> 01:28:14.790
- Come on.
- Maybe next time, Sonny.

01:28:20.106 --> 01:28:22.370
Come on.

01:28:22.442 --> 01:28:25.240
Take my car.
Bobby, you drive.

01:28:25.312 --> 01:28:26.643
Okay, Sonny.

01:28:51.471 --> 01:28:53.439
Why are you driving Sonny's car?

01:28:53.506 --> 01:28:56.907
- What are you talking about?
- I saw you driving his car.

01:28:56.976 --> 01:29:00.241
- I don't want you driving his car.
- I'm not in the mood to hear this.

01:29:00.313 --> 01:29:02.781
I don't care. We already
talked about the bikers...

01:29:02.849 --> 01:29:04.783
and that fight in that bar.

01:29:04.851 --> 01:29:07.319
- I don't want you in that bar.
- Should I have run away?

01:29:07.387 --> 01:29:10.754
- Make them think I got no heart?
- You think those guys care?

01:29:10.824 --> 01:29:12.792
What make you think
you're so special?

01:29:12.859 --> 01:29:14.986
- You don't know Sonny.
- I know how he thinks.

01:29:15.061 --> 01:29:17.052
You fuck up,
he'll hurt you like anybody.

01:29:17.130 --> 01:29:19.792
- Sonny trusts me.
- He can't trust anybody.

01:29:19.866 --> 01:29:22.892
The sooner you know that the better.
How often do I have to tell you?

01:29:22.969 --> 01:29:24.937
People don't respect him.
They fear him.

01:29:25.004 --> 01:29:27.097
There's a big difference.
You want to be somebody?

01:29:27.173 --> 01:29:29.903
Be somebody who works
and takes cares of his family.

01:29:29.976 --> 01:29:32.444
Yeah, look away. Look...

01:29:32.512 --> 01:29:35.948
You're my only son. I'm looking
out for your best interests.

01:29:36.015 --> 01:29:38.142
The saddest thing in life
is wasted talent.

01:29:38.218 --> 01:29:42.211
- I don't want to hear this.
- You're going to hear it.

01:29:42.288 --> 01:29:44.620
I might not have money,
I might not have a Cadillac...

01:29:44.691 --> 01:29:46.716
but I don't have to
look over my shoulder.

01:29:46.793 --> 01:29:49.387
I don't answer to anybody. My
parents came here with nothing...

01:29:49.462 --> 01:29:51.760
And they died with nothing.

01:29:51.831 --> 01:29:54.891
Don't you dare disrespect your
grandparents! Do you hear me?

01:29:54.968 --> 01:29:57.402
And you're wrong. They tried
to give me a better life.

01:29:57.470 --> 01:29:59.768
- I'm trying to...
- What better life?

01:29:59.839 --> 01:30:02.933
We don't own a car! We ain't got money!
We ain't got nothing!

01:30:03.009 --> 01:30:06.172
Don't take it out on me
because you're a bus driver.

01:30:06.246 --> 01:30:07.838
The working man is a sucker!

01:30:22.829 --> 01:30:26.424
Hey, C. Look what these black
motherfuckers did to our club.

01:30:26.499 --> 01:30:29.696
You believe the balls on them,
throwing eggs at our club?

01:30:29.769 --> 01:30:33.136
Get in the car.
We're going to go fuck them up.

01:30:33.206 --> 01:30:35.003
Get in the car.

01:30:37.277 --> 01:30:38.676
Sonny and Jimmy!

01:30:38.745 --> 01:30:42.681
Oh, shit! Back off!
Get out of here!

01:30:42.749 --> 01:30:44.376
What's going on?

01:30:46.052 --> 01:30:48.111
After you picked up my car,
where did you go?

01:30:48.188 --> 01:30:51.157
I drove around and went
to pick up Jane. Why?

01:30:51.224 --> 01:30:53.124
Was there really a Jane?

01:30:53.193 --> 01:30:54.820
Sonny, what is it?

01:30:54.894 --> 01:30:57.294
After you dropped that car off,
it didn't start.

01:30:57.363 --> 01:30:59.957
We found something on the
engine. It didn't go off.

01:31:00.033 --> 01:31:04.902
Tell me how that got on there,
and where did you go in my car!

01:31:04.971 --> 01:31:07.735
I picked it up,
I drove right to the school...

01:31:07.807 --> 01:31:09.536
and I locked the doors
like you told me.

01:31:09.609 --> 01:31:12.544
Don't lie to me!
Where did you go with my car?

01:31:12.612 --> 01:31:15.046
I didn't do anything!
I swear! Please!

01:31:15.114 --> 01:31:18.743
- Don't lie to me!
- I didn't do anything!

01:31:18.818 --> 01:31:22.584
I swear, I just went right
to the school and that was it!

01:31:22.655 --> 01:31:24.589
I swear to God!
Why would I hurt you?

01:31:24.657 --> 01:31:26.591
You've been like a father to me!

01:31:39.806 --> 01:31:42.604
Calogero? Hey!

01:31:45.712 --> 01:31:48.010
- What happened to my son?
- Go drive your bus.

01:31:48.081 --> 01:31:51.175
- Don't tell me to drive my bus!
- Take it easy!

01:31:51.251 --> 01:31:53.344
Touch me and I'll stick you
in the fucking ground!

01:31:56.589 --> 01:32:00.116
Next time find out what's going
on before you open your mouth.

01:32:16.175 --> 01:32:17.870
Come here.

01:32:25.618 --> 01:32:28.815
- What happened with you and Sonny?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

01:32:28.888 --> 01:32:30.480
Where'd you get this car?

01:32:30.557 --> 01:32:32.787
Don't worry about it.
We borrowed it.

01:32:36.930 --> 01:32:39.125
Slow down!

01:32:39.198 --> 01:32:41.325
I don't wanna get pinched
before we get there.

01:32:41.401 --> 01:32:44.131
I know. I'm not driver
for nothing.

01:32:44.203 --> 01:32:46.000
We're in a hot car. Slow down.

01:32:46.072 --> 01:32:49.439
I know what I'm doing.
Don't worry about it.

01:32:49.509 --> 01:32:50.999
What's that smell?

01:32:51.077 --> 01:32:53.477
We made those niggers
a cocktail.

01:32:53.546 --> 01:32:56.310
Look at these beauties.

01:32:56.382 --> 01:32:59.112
We're going to teach them
a lesson.

01:32:59.185 --> 01:33:02.985
- We're going to finish the job.
- For throwing eggs at our joint.

01:33:03.056 --> 01:33:05.490
Ralphie, take this.

01:33:07.627 --> 01:33:09.595
Why don't you give me
the big one?

01:33:09.662 --> 01:33:11.323
Take that and shut up!

01:33:11.397 --> 01:33:15.333
I'll take these motherfuckers!
I hate them! I'll kill them!

01:33:15.401 --> 01:33:18.199
What are you doing,
lighting a cigarette?

01:33:18.271 --> 01:33:21.104
- Relax.
- You got the cocktails in here.

01:33:21.174 --> 01:33:24.837
Relax. I know what I'm doing.

01:33:24.911 --> 01:33:27.675
I can't wait to see the look
on those motherfuckers' faces.

01:33:27.747 --> 01:33:29.715
I can't wait.

01:33:29.782 --> 01:33:33.548
They were smiling. I was too,
but I was dying inside.

01:33:34.854 --> 01:33:38.290
I wanted out, but I
couldn't get out of the car.

01:33:38.358 --> 01:33:40.349
What was I going to say?
"Let me out. I'm afraid."

01:33:40.426 --> 01:33:42.360
You better use that gun.

01:33:42.428 --> 01:33:44.362
I could never go back
to that neighborhood.

01:33:44.430 --> 01:33:47.126
They would call me a punk,
a dog, a mutt.

01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:49.134
They would say I got no heart.

01:33:49.202 --> 01:33:53.366
I kept hearing my father's voice
in my head. "Don't blow it, son.

01:33:53.439 --> 01:33:57.205
These people will hurt you.
Don't waste your talent."

01:33:57.276 --> 01:33:59.369
Then I kept hearing
Sonny's voice.

01:33:59.445 --> 01:34:04.314
"Be careful, C. Don't lose it.
Keep your head."

01:34:04.384 --> 01:34:07.376
Somebody pulled the chain,
and I was going down the toilet.

01:34:14.661 --> 01:34:16.595
They want to throw eggs
at our club?

01:34:16.663 --> 01:34:18.426
We'll give them
a big surprise.

01:34:22.268 --> 01:34:24.259
C, out of the car.

01:34:24.337 --> 01:34:27.568
- He's with us.
- Mind your business. Get out.

01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:30.040
Come on. He's with us.

01:34:30.109 --> 01:34:32.202
Come on. Move.

01:34:37.116 --> 01:34:39.676
For the last time,
stay away from this kid.

01:35:05.211 --> 01:35:08.374
I can't believe it.
You don't even trust me?

01:35:08.448 --> 01:35:10.916
Listen. It's not
that I don't trust you.

01:35:10.983 --> 01:35:15.613
I won't listen. You don't even
believe there was a Jane.

01:35:15.688 --> 01:35:17.918
Couldn't it have been in the car
when I picked it up?

01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:21.721
Me and Jane could have gotten
killed. You never thought that, did you?

01:35:24.397 --> 01:35:26.126
Don't you trust anybody?

01:35:29.535 --> 01:35:31.469
It's a horrible way to live.

01:35:32.672 --> 01:35:34.936
For me, it's the only way.

01:35:35.007 --> 01:35:36.565
Not for me.

01:35:57.263 --> 01:35:59.493
Some fine-looking black chick
was just here looking for you.

01:35:59.565 --> 01:36:02.864
- She just left?
- lf you hurry, you'll catch her.

01:36:02.935 --> 01:36:04.402
Come here.

01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:06.404
Told you.

01:36:08.875 --> 01:36:11.105
You want me to go get him?

01:36:11.177 --> 01:36:12.610
No, leave him alone.

01:36:19.085 --> 01:36:22.612
My brother told me the truth.
You did try to help him.

01:36:22.688 --> 01:36:24.121
I told you.

01:36:24.190 --> 01:36:26.681
I know. But he
took it out on you.

01:36:26.759 --> 01:36:29.159
It's okay.
I understand how he felt.

01:36:29.228 --> 01:36:31.253
I'm glad you understand.

01:36:35.768 --> 01:36:38.794
Mind your own business!
Get back in your house!

01:36:41.174 --> 01:36:43.665
Let them stare.
Give me your hand.

01:36:45.845 --> 01:36:47.335
Give me your hand.

01:36:52.285 --> 01:36:54.344
- Glad you came to see me.
- I missed you.

01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:55.887
I missed you too.

01:36:58.658 --> 01:37:00.558
I think you're beautiful.

01:37:01.561 --> 01:37:03.256
Stop.

01:37:03.329 --> 01:37:04.819
No, I really do.

01:37:06.532 --> 01:37:09.729
I want to be with you,
and I don't care what anybody says.

01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:14.567
- Can I have a kiss?
- Sure.

01:37:23.382 --> 01:37:25.316
That's not a kiss.

01:37:26.385 --> 01:37:28.080
This is a kiss.

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:43.360
Do you know how to make sauce?

01:37:43.436 --> 01:37:45.233
What?

01:37:45.304 --> 01:37:47.238
You know, sauce for macaroni.

01:37:49.242 --> 01:37:50.231
Shut up.

01:38:03.222 --> 01:38:05.190
I'm really sorry
about what happened.

01:38:06.826 --> 01:38:08.987
- My brother didn't mean it.
- Where's your car?

01:38:09.061 --> 01:38:11.461
Give me the keys! We got to go!

01:38:11.530 --> 01:38:14.465
- What are you talking about?
- We got to get there.

01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:36.188
I knew you were
one of the great ones.

01:38:36.255 --> 01:38:38.655
Great ones?
What are you talking about?

01:38:38.724 --> 01:38:40.658
Never mind.
It's an Italian thing.

01:38:51.437 --> 01:38:53.997
Hurry up.
Make a U-turn over here.

01:38:55.241 --> 01:38:56.674
Go by in front.

01:38:59.078 --> 01:39:01.103
What are they doing
in our neighborhood?

01:39:49.161 --> 01:39:51.095
Get it out!

01:40:44.383 --> 01:40:46.044
Be careful, guys.

01:40:46.118 --> 01:40:47.881
- What's happening?
- What happened?

01:40:47.953 --> 01:40:51.445
- Four white guys just got blown up.
- White guys got killed, that's what.

01:41:00.499 --> 01:41:02.364
Willy, are you all right?

01:41:04.036 --> 01:41:05.970
Yeah, I'm all right.

01:41:12.011 --> 01:41:15.242
They started out as white boys.
Now they are toast.

01:41:15.314 --> 01:41:18.340
They look better now, right?

01:41:18.417 --> 01:41:21.978
They left something for you
in the trunk! Take a look.

01:41:22.054 --> 01:41:24.284
Get out of our neighborhood!

01:41:24.356 --> 01:41:26.517
Fucking pussy-ass motherfucker!

01:41:26.592 --> 01:41:29.083
Don't say shit, man!

01:41:29.161 --> 01:41:31.129
Get out of the neighborhood!

01:41:33.332 --> 01:41:37.632
Sometimes when I think about it I don't
know if I should've been happy or sad.

01:41:37.703 --> 01:41:39.500
Happy because I was alive...

01:41:39.572 --> 01:41:42.040
or sad because
my friends were dead.

01:41:43.409 --> 01:41:45.673
But one thing I knew was
I was grateful.

01:41:45.744 --> 01:41:47.712
Grateful because of Sonny.

01:41:48.914 --> 01:41:51.644
Listen, Jane, I got to go.

01:41:51.717 --> 01:41:53.344
- You okay?
- Yeah, man.

01:41:53.419 --> 01:41:57.116
- Listen, I'm sorry.
- Jive-ass white motherfucker!

01:41:57.189 --> 01:41:59.623
You don't understand.
I was in that car.

01:41:59.692 --> 01:42:02.126
Just go. The boys
are about to go crazy.

01:42:02.194 --> 01:42:05.630
What are you looking at?
Fuck that bitch too!

01:42:07.133 --> 01:42:08.191
Go.

01:42:11.437 --> 01:42:13.462
Get the fuck out of
the neighborhood!

01:42:40.733 --> 01:42:42.724
He saved my life.

01:42:55.214 --> 01:42:57.182
I had to tell him.

01:42:57.249 --> 01:42:59.877
I wanted to thank Sonny.
He saved my life.

01:43:12.431 --> 01:43:14.524
C, I swear,
my grandmother's still sick.

01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:16.534
I'll give you the 20 next week.

01:43:16.602 --> 01:43:18.194
Forget the 20!

01:43:32.718 --> 01:43:35.812
- You know where Sonny is?
- I don't care where he is!

01:43:35.888 --> 01:43:38.686
I'm losing here!
Why are you breaking my balls?

01:43:38.757 --> 01:43:40.224
He's in the front.

01:43:42.895 --> 01:43:44.829
C! Come here!

01:43:49.068 --> 01:43:50.831
Let my boy through.

01:43:55.374 --> 01:43:57.740
Come here.

01:43:57.810 --> 01:44:00.779
All I could see
was big smiling faces.

01:44:02.214 --> 01:44:04.307
All of a sudden, out of all
these smiling faces...

01:44:04.383 --> 01:44:06.146
there was this one face.

01:44:06.218 --> 01:44:08.914
I couldn't understand why I kept
looking at this one face...

01:44:08.988 --> 01:44:11.479
and then I realized
he wasn't smiling.

01:44:12.891 --> 01:44:15.359
All I could see was this guy...

01:44:15.427 --> 01:44:17.361
and nobody could see him but me.

01:44:20.499 --> 01:44:22.490
Come on, C!

01:44:25.638 --> 01:44:27.037
Come here!

01:44:34.079 --> 01:44:36.547
Get an ambulance!

01:44:55.801 --> 01:44:58.895
The guy that killed Sonny
was the son of the man he killed...

01:44:58.971 --> 01:45:01.030
eight years earlier
in front of my house.

01:45:39.745 --> 01:45:42.339
There were flowers
all over the place.

01:45:42.414 --> 01:45:44.348
Gangsters have this thing
about flowers.

01:45:45.417 --> 01:45:47.942
Whoever sends the biggest arrangement
cares the most.

01:46:00.866 --> 01:46:03.835
- John and Anthony from Detroit.
- How are you?

01:46:07.806 --> 01:46:09.797
Did you see the way
he went down?

01:46:12.745 --> 01:46:14.770
It was just like
Sonny said it would be.

01:46:16.582 --> 01:46:18.106
Nobody cares.

01:46:36.835 --> 01:46:39.099
I'm sorry,
but we got to close up.

01:46:41.874 --> 01:46:43.967
Could you give me
a couple more minutes?

01:46:44.042 --> 01:46:46.135
Okay. I'll be in my office.

01:47:07.533 --> 01:47:09.967
How are you doing, Sonny?

01:47:10.035 --> 01:47:11.593
Not so good, huh?

01:47:13.172 --> 01:47:15.265
She passed the test.
That's what I wanted to tell you.

01:47:16.341 --> 01:47:18.275
She might be
my first great one.

01:47:19.845 --> 01:47:23.042
I'm going to go out with her.
Thanks for helping me.

01:47:24.483 --> 01:47:26.451
Thank you for saving my life.

01:47:26.518 --> 01:47:28.452
I never got a chance
to tell you.

01:47:30.189 --> 01:47:34.489
They all died.
Slick, Aldo, Mario, Ralphie.

01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:35.993
All of them.

01:47:40.199 --> 01:47:42.759
Sorry. I thought I was alone.
I'm just thinking out loud.

01:47:42.835 --> 01:47:44.826
That's okay.
It's understandable.

01:47:48.941 --> 01:47:51.933
This man is a great man.
He saved my life.

01:47:57.983 --> 01:48:00.952
- You Lorenzo the bus driver's kid?
- Yeah.

01:48:01.019 --> 01:48:03.010
- C, right?
- Yeah.

01:48:03.088 --> 01:48:05.022
Sonny told me all about you.

01:48:05.090 --> 01:48:07.388
Sorry, but I don't
even know who you are.

01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:09.784
My name is Carmine.

01:48:10.863 --> 01:48:13.297
We go back a long way together,
Sonny and me.

01:48:15.100 --> 01:48:17.068
He saved my life too once.

01:48:21.740 --> 01:48:23.731
You don't remember me, do you?

01:48:25.644 --> 01:48:28.306
Many years ago?
In front of your house?

01:48:29.781 --> 01:48:31.840
You don't remember this?

01:48:31.917 --> 01:48:36.047
You were the guy who got hit
with the baseball bat, right?

01:48:37.122 --> 01:48:38.851
Yeah, I remember.

01:48:38.924 --> 01:48:40.892
I was there.
I saw the whole thing.

01:48:40.959 --> 01:48:42.483
I know, kid.

01:48:43.862 --> 01:48:45.796
Sonny told me what you did.

01:48:46.798 --> 01:48:50.063
Listen, I've been away.

01:48:50.135 --> 01:48:54.003
But I'll be in the neighborhood
taking care of things for a while.

01:48:54.072 --> 01:48:57.701
You need anything, come and
see me at the bar, okay?

01:48:57.776 --> 01:49:01.576
I think I'll give the bar a rest
for a while, but thanks anyway.

01:49:01.647 --> 01:49:03.080
It's okay. I understand.

01:49:04.182 --> 01:49:06.650
Was that fight really over
a parking space?

01:49:24.036 --> 01:49:26.266
Don't forget.
You need anything, come see me.

01:49:27.639 --> 01:49:29.937
- Anything.
- All right.

01:49:30.008 --> 01:49:31.498
So long, kid.

01:49:43.722 --> 01:49:45.656
Dad, what are you doing here?

01:49:49.494 --> 01:49:51.428
I came to pay my respects
to your friend.

01:49:53.732 --> 01:49:55.199
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:49:55.267 --> 01:49:57.929
I'm sorry if I ever hurt you
in any way.

01:50:00.272 --> 01:50:01.705
It's okay.

01:50:02.808 --> 01:50:04.742
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:50:13.719 --> 01:50:16.552
I want to thank you
for saving my kid's life.

01:50:20.759 --> 01:50:22.818
I never hated you.
I guess it's...

01:50:24.229 --> 01:50:27.426
that I was mad at you because
you made him grow up so fast.

01:50:32.437 --> 01:50:34.428
May God have mercy on your soul.

01:50:39.444 --> 01:50:40.877
I'll wait over here.

01:50:46.084 --> 01:50:47.642
Did you hear that?

01:50:48.954 --> 01:50:50.922
My father didn't hate you.

01:50:52.958 --> 01:50:54.448
Nobody cares, huh?

01:50:56.461 --> 01:50:58.429
You were wrong about that one.

01:51:04.403 --> 01:51:05.836
Wasted talent.

01:51:11.076 --> 01:51:12.543
See you around.

01:51:22.421 --> 01:51:23.945
Let's go home, C.

01:51:30.929 --> 01:51:32.954
Sonny and my father
always said...

01:51:33.031 --> 01:51:35.022
that when I get older
I would understand.

01:51:36.101 --> 01:51:38.228
Well, I finally did.

01:51:38.303 --> 01:51:40.601
I learned something
from these two men.

01:51:40.672 --> 01:51:43.800
I learned to give love
and get love unconditionally.

01:51:43.875 --> 01:51:46.002
You just have to accept people
for what they are.

01:51:47.245 --> 01:51:49.406
And I learned
the greatest gift of all.

01:51:49.481 --> 01:51:52.382
The saddest thing in life
is wasted talent.

01:51:53.518 --> 01:51:56.817
And the choices that you make
will shape your life forever.

01:51:58.356 --> 01:52:00.415
But you can ask anybody
from my neighborhood...

01:52:00.492 --> 01:52:02.460
and they'll just tell you.

01:52:02.527 --> 01:52:04.495
This is just another Bronx tale.
