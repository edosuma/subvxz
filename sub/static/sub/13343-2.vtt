WEBVTT

00:06.807 --> 00:10.010
( chatter )

00:10.111 --> 00:12.012
And what car are you
currently driving?

00:12.113 --> 00:14.715
I'm currently
driving a Cadillac.
Fuck the Mercedes.

00:14.815 --> 00:16.184
Cheers.

00:17.885 --> 00:19.187
What a lovely
party, Mother.

00:19.287 --> 00:21.989
I guess my invitation
got lost in the mail.

00:22.090 --> 00:24.492
You shouldn't be
out of bed, dear.

00:24.592 --> 00:27.027
Dr. Goldstein here said
you need your rest.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.662
But I want
to join the party.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.431
Or do I embarrass you

00:30.531 --> 00:33.167
in front of all your
fancy society friends?

00:33.267 --> 00:35.603
( stammers )
Why would you embarrass me?

00:35.703 --> 00:36.904
Because of this?

00:37.004 --> 00:39.006
Because of
my little accident.

00:39.107 --> 00:40.341
( laughs )

00:40.441 --> 00:41.342
Oh, cut!

00:41.442 --> 00:43.577
Come on, that was
my best take.

00:43.677 --> 00:45.146
You can't
keep laughing.

00:45.246 --> 00:47.148
- Sorry, but it's funny.
- No, it's not funny.

00:47.248 --> 00:49.083
One out of 12 teenage girls
tries to kill themselves.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.384
Is that funny to you?

00:50.484 --> 00:52.886
No, but you playing
a teenage girl is.

00:52.986 --> 00:54.322
Let's go again.

00:54.422 --> 00:55.723
Oh, can we make this
the last take?

00:55.823 --> 00:56.924
Marion's gonna
be home soon.

00:57.024 --> 00:58.226
Okay, quick as we can,
everyone.

00:58.326 --> 00:59.927
Wade's ex-wife
will be home soon.

01:00.027 --> 01:01.862
We're not divorced.
We're just separated.

01:01.962 --> 01:04.432
And not for long.
Guess what this Casanova's
got planned later?

01:04.532 --> 01:07.000
He's taking her out
in a bloody limousine.

01:07.101 --> 01:08.836
Am I right?
I wish I was
his ex-wife.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.138
- We're just separated.
- Yeah.

01:10.238 --> 01:11.672
- I hope it goes well, okay.
- It will.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.641
Let's pick this up, okay?
Are you still rolling?

01:13.741 --> 01:15.643
( woman clears throat )

01:15.743 --> 01:18.078
Action.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.580
Because of
my little accident?

01:19.680 --> 01:21.782
( laughs )
Sorry, sorry.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.884
You should think
about making this
into a comedy.

01:23.984 --> 01:27.188
We're starting over.
Get back. Go.

01:27.288 --> 01:30.191
* Just a little boy lost
looking for a lamb *

01:30.291 --> 01:33.060
* In the all-night city

01:33.161 --> 01:38.332
* Living in
his lonely limousine *

01:38.432 --> 01:41.569
* And though
he never has to worry *

01:41.669 --> 01:45.173
* He's the only one
and only one *

01:45.273 --> 01:46.974
* He's ever gonna need

01:47.074 --> 01:50.211
* Absolutely,
he's in definite need *

01:50.311 --> 01:54.081
* Ooh, maybe we've been
alone too long *

01:54.182 --> 01:57.117
* You don't
want to be lonely *

01:57.218 --> 01:59.920
* Maybe we've been
alone too long *

02:00.020 --> 02:04.325
* You don't want
to be lonely. *

02:13.534 --> 02:14.968
Hello.

02:15.068 --> 02:16.170
Hello, Marion.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.671
You look--
you look well.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.673
Thank you.
Can I talk to you
for a second?

02:19.773 --> 02:21.475
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.844
- Wade, are you
coming with us, or...
- Yeah, just a second.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.646
Yeah, okay.

02:28.616 --> 02:31.185
I don't want to come off
like I'm being difficult,

02:31.285 --> 02:33.587
but you said
you'd be gone by 3:00.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.823
I mean, you gave us
permission to be here,
so I thought...

02:35.923 --> 02:38.792
The whole point of being
separated is that we give
each other space.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.394
Yeah, I know.

02:40.494 --> 02:43.531
I just-- I don't understand,
like, what the problem is.

02:43.631 --> 02:47.835
The problem is that
I don't know who I am
except your wife.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.169
Why is that a problem?

02:49.270 --> 02:50.738
I don't--
I'm not my own person.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.073
- Okay, that's it for me...
- Ooh, I-- we should--

02:53.173 --> 02:55.008
- 'cause we have
got to-- haven't we?
- yeah, we're running late.

02:55.108 --> 02:56.710
- Mm-hmm.
- We've gotta
hit the streets.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.412
We've gotta beat
the bloody traffic,

02:58.512 --> 03:00.147
- so, we're out of your hair.
- Yeah, okay.

03:00.248 --> 03:02.716
- Good to see ya.
Good to see ya.
- Yeah.

03:05.353 --> 03:07.488
Okay, I don't want
to talk about this.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.690
Oh, I know you don't,
and that's one
of the problems,

03:09.790 --> 03:13.694
but I have to talk
about how I feel
or I'll go crazy.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.963
Just-- what do you feel?
What do you wanna say?

03:17.365 --> 03:20.768
Wade, sometimes I wonder
what it would be like...

03:20.868 --> 03:23.304
if we'd never met.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.439
Marion, sorry.
Your car's blocking me in.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.308
Any chance
I could move it?

03:27.408 --> 03:29.410
Uh, yeah, fine.

03:29.510 --> 03:32.980
Did you know
I bought a sex toy?

03:33.080 --> 03:34.582
Keys.
Forgot the keys.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.517
- Yes, they're--
- Have them. I'm off.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.019
We can fix it.

03:39.119 --> 03:42.290
- No, we just--
we need a fresh start.
- ( car alarm blaring )

03:42.390 --> 03:44.592
- ( sighs )
- That is all we need, okay?

03:44.692 --> 03:46.660
- And I was gonna-- listen.
- No, it's--

03:46.760 --> 03:48.496
I was gonna surprise you
tonight, all right,

03:48.596 --> 03:50.197
but I'm picking
you up for dinner--

03:50.298 --> 03:53.767
Sorry, um, which one is it
to switch off the alarm?

03:53.867 --> 03:55.403
It's the middle one.

03:55.503 --> 03:58.105
- You have to press it twice.
- You gotta press it twice.

03:58.205 --> 03:59.106
Middle one.
Gotta press it twice.

03:59.206 --> 04:00.341
( car alarm chirps )

04:00.441 --> 04:01.875
I was gonna
surprise you tonight.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.444
I'm picking you up,
we're going to dinner,

04:03.544 --> 04:05.713
and I rented
a stretch limousine.

04:05.813 --> 04:08.982
- It's all planned out.
- No, I'm not going on
a date with you, Wade.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.019
I've been thinking,
and I don't think

04:12.119 --> 04:13.987
we should see each other
for a month.

04:15.989 --> 04:17.758
Me again.

04:17.858 --> 04:20.761
We cannot figure out
where the emergency brake is
on the car.

04:20.861 --> 04:25.566
Is it one of those
sort of that's, you know,
or is it the kind of...

04:29.337 --> 04:32.039
Oh, pop out yourself.
Makes sense.

04:34.074 --> 04:35.776
How did that go?

04:35.876 --> 04:38.679
She doesn't want to see
or talk to me for a month.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.848
( sighing )

04:43.016 --> 04:45.553
Does that mean
that limousine's
going to waste?

04:56.296 --> 04:57.465
It's supposed
to be here by now.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.500
Probably dropping off
some big shot.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.335
Well, you know what
the company's called--
Superstar Limos.

05:01.435 --> 05:02.803
- Wade: Really?
- Yeah.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.572
I think that's the one
that the Hollywood pros use.

05:04.672 --> 05:07.107
I've never seen people
so excited about a limo before.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.109
Who doesn't get excited
about a limousine?

05:09.209 --> 05:11.311
- ( scoffs )
- It's the glamour, isn't it?
The sophistication.

05:11.412 --> 05:12.613
Who's behind
the darkened windows?

05:12.713 --> 05:14.515
Is it George Clooney?
Is it Jennifer Lopez?

05:14.615 --> 05:16.450
Is it someone
going to a funeral?
You don't know.

05:16.550 --> 05:19.286
Don't disrespect the limo.

05:19.387 --> 05:21.355
Hey, what's with
the French film bollocks?

05:21.455 --> 05:22.656
I never said
you could change my art.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.892
I said you could have
a few friends over.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.828
Well, I wanted to create
a sort of ambiance.

05:27.928 --> 05:32.299
- Yeah?
- I wanted to host
more of a salon.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.634
- A salon?
- Yes.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.569
A place where
my friends and I

05:35.669 --> 05:37.471
can talk about art...

05:37.571 --> 05:41.241
- Right.
- and culture, philosophy,
or politics.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.677
So you and the other
struggling actresses
are gonna be sat around

05:43.777 --> 05:46.780
discussing Wittgenstein
and North Korea?

05:46.880 --> 05:49.249
- Yes, that might come up.
- ( jazz music playing )

05:49.349 --> 05:50.250
- That could come up?
- Yeah.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.852
Okay, wow.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.755
Oh, and the sound track
for tonight will be jazz,
I noticed.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.390
- Oh, I love jazz.
- You love jazz?

05:56.490 --> 05:58.325
- Yes.
- Name three key
jazz musicians.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.027
( scoffs )

06:01.895 --> 06:04.197
- Miles Davis.
- Number one, yeah.

06:04.297 --> 06:05.466
Lance Armstrong.

06:05.566 --> 06:06.734
The trumpet player,
Lance Armstrong?

06:06.834 --> 06:08.836
- Yes.
- Okay, and number three?

06:08.936 --> 06:12.440
The Loneliest Monk.

06:12.540 --> 06:13.974
The Loneliest Monk?

06:14.074 --> 06:16.143
- Yes. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

06:16.243 --> 06:18.245
'Cause I've heard of
the guy called Thelonious Monk.
You're not thinking of him?

06:18.345 --> 06:20.080
- Yeah, yeah.
That's what I said.
- That's what you said.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.281
- Yeah, he's great.
- Sure, sure, sure, sure.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.382
He's great.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.951
You clearly are
a jazz aficionado.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.887
- My apologies.
- I am.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.388
- It's here! The limo's here!
- Is the limo here?

06:28.489 --> 06:29.890
- Come and see it.
- Limo's here!

06:29.990 --> 06:32.292
- ( door opens )
- I've seen a long car before.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.527
- Yeah.
- Look at that.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.262
Oh.
( laughs )

06:35.362 --> 06:36.530
- Dang, look at that.
- Look at this.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.065
That's a nice ride
right there.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.833
- Cool, isn't it?
- It is cool. Look at that.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.101
I know.

06:41.201 --> 06:42.470
- How you feeling?
- Feeling great.

06:42.570 --> 06:43.704
- Yeah?
- Yeah, why?

06:43.804 --> 06:45.372
Just after that thing
with Marion,

06:45.473 --> 06:47.040
I just thought
you might be a bit,
you know--

06:47.140 --> 06:49.443
- so, ruining it.
- Hey, don't worry about me.

06:49.543 --> 06:50.944
Yeah, we're spending
30 days apart.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.279
Life's gotta be lived.

06:52.379 --> 06:54.381
Ooh, that's a nice
little ride right there.

06:54.482 --> 06:56.650
Look at that.
Dang.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.319
What's, like,
the most amount of people
you could have in here?

06:59.419 --> 07:00.420
Well, the max is 12.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.422
What about the least?

07:02.523 --> 07:04.257
Just me.

07:04.357 --> 07:06.193
You got a nickname
for the limo?

07:06.293 --> 07:07.461
Nope.

07:07.561 --> 07:09.129
I'd probably call it
My Best Black Buddy.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.532
Oh.

07:11.632 --> 07:12.866
I've never told
anyone this before,

07:12.966 --> 07:14.668
but I've actually
got a fantasy

07:14.768 --> 07:17.905
of one day driving
back to my hometown
in a limo

07:18.005 --> 07:20.774
with my beautiful wife,
who's a model

07:20.874 --> 07:24.311
with a PhD
in philosophy--
smart lady--

07:24.411 --> 07:26.313
and we drive in
and everyone I ever
went to school with

07:26.413 --> 07:28.482
and all the girls
that wouldn't ever
go on dates with me,

07:28.582 --> 07:30.618
they come out, they see
the limo, they're like,
"Who's that?"

07:30.718 --> 07:32.820
"It's Stuart Pritchard!
Why did we let him slip
through our fingers?"

07:32.920 --> 07:35.022
- You know what I mean?
- Oh.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.924
And I'll tell you
who else will be there--
Mike Moffat, all right?

07:37.024 --> 07:38.325
And he'll be eating
his fucking words,

07:38.425 --> 07:39.560
let me tell you that
for nothing.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.595
Who is Mike Moffat?

07:41.695 --> 07:42.963
Hey, why'd you invite him?

07:43.063 --> 07:44.632
So, yeah, I got
my extensions out last week

07:44.732 --> 07:47.768
- and this is all my real hair.
- Oh, hello, ladies.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.036
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.403
Woman #3: Hi.

07:50.504 --> 07:51.639
Sorry, you must think
I'm a terrible show-off.

07:51.739 --> 07:54.341
You've caught me
admiring my limousine.

07:54.441 --> 07:57.110
( laughs )
I need the legroom.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.947
- ( both laugh )
- No, I'm-- I don't normally
drive 'round in a limo.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.315
I, um-- I actually
drive a vintage BMW.

08:02.415 --> 08:03.551
From 1994.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.318
Hey, I'm Kives.
Pleasure.

08:05.418 --> 08:09.256
Yeah, um, ladies,
can I just ask you
a very quick question?

08:09.356 --> 08:11.458
Hey, guys.
I don't know what
you've got planned tonight,

08:11.559 --> 08:13.293
but we're just gonna be
hitting some clubs,

08:13.393 --> 08:15.563
just maxing, relaxing
in the limo, so you're
welcome to join if you--

08:15.663 --> 08:17.865
Thank you, but we already
have a fun night in store.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.767
- Woman: Okay. Yay, wine.
- All right.

08:19.867 --> 08:22.670
- Jessica: Okay, let's go.
- ( engine starts )

08:23.771 --> 08:25.673
Stuart: Ladies!

08:25.773 --> 08:28.842
* Get your motor running

08:28.942 --> 08:31.712
( both )
* Head out on the highway

08:31.812 --> 08:35.215
* Looking for adventure

08:35.315 --> 08:38.552
* In whatever
comes our way *

08:38.652 --> 08:42.089
* Born to be wild

08:45.125 --> 08:46.960
* Born to be wild.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.796
It's gonna take too long.
It's gonna take too long.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.631
- It's gonna take too long.
- Are you-- you're going down?

08:50.731 --> 08:52.065
Stuart: Just come down.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.836
Wade:
Ow, you gotta
move your leg.

09:02.576 --> 09:04.311
Wade, there's snacks
in here, mate.

09:04.411 --> 09:05.779
No, there's not.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.480
- Are the snacks free?
- Chauffeur: Uh, no, sir.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.049
- What about the booze?
- Nope.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.118
- What about the water?
- Yeah, water's fine.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.253
- Did you hear that?
- I'll have one of those
later...

09:13.353 --> 09:14.588
if I get thirsty.

09:14.688 --> 09:16.824
- ( window whirrs )
- Look at that.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.192
Bloody hell.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.461
Now that is the sort of lady
that's at home in a limousine.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.562
Am I right?

09:22.663 --> 09:24.231
Where do women
like that hang out?

09:24.331 --> 09:27.267
Oh, I don't know, Soho House,
Ambassador Room, my dick.

09:27.367 --> 09:28.802
Don't cheapen this...

09:28.902 --> 09:31.438
although the Ambassador Room's
not a bad idea.

09:31.538 --> 09:33.573
Driver,
to the Ambassador Room.

09:33.674 --> 09:36.209
Actually, I don't think
you're gonna get in there
without a reservation.

09:36.309 --> 09:39.512
( scoffs )
This is a reservation
right here.

09:39.613 --> 09:40.948
What's the ZIP code
down there?

09:41.048 --> 09:43.083
- 310, baby.
- That's an area code.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.818
Still works.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.921
Did you guys know that
Gwyneth Paltrow's doctor

09:48.021 --> 09:50.423
banned her from eating eggs,
shellfish, deepwater fish,

09:50.523 --> 09:53.093
wheat, meat, and coffee
for three weeks?

09:53.193 --> 09:55.896
It worked
'cause she looks amazing.

09:55.996 --> 09:58.431
Have you guys tried
any of her gluten-free recipes?

09:58.531 --> 10:00.500
You know, I haven't,
but I want to.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.435
- I want to.
- Yeah, I want to, too.

10:02.535 --> 10:06.006
What do people think
about North Korea?

10:09.777 --> 10:11.478
Well, I'm definitely
not an expert,

10:11.578 --> 10:14.782
but I just feel like
we should nuke them
before they nuke us.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.917
You guys,
it's Saturday night.

10:17.017 --> 10:19.619
- Can we not talk about this?
It's depressing.
- Yeah.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.222
Well, I just thought
that it might be kinda cool

10:22.322 --> 10:24.725
to talk about something
a little bit different tonight,

10:24.825 --> 10:27.695
like art or culture,

10:27.795 --> 10:30.998
or politics,
philosophy.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.700
Why?

10:32.800 --> 10:35.602
Don't you guys feel like
we're in a bit of a rut?

10:35.703 --> 10:37.705
- Yeah.
- We go out, we party,

10:37.805 --> 10:39.740
see the same people,
talk about the same stuff.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.241
Aren't you guys
bored of that?

10:42.810 --> 10:46.680
Do you ever wonder, like,
what are we doing here?

10:46.780 --> 10:48.949
To be in TV and movies.

10:49.049 --> 10:52.385
No, I don't mean,
like, in L.A.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.587
I mean, like,
in the whole--

10:54.688 --> 10:56.690
Hey, can you
change the music?

10:56.790 --> 10:58.225
It's kinda weird.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.627
Oh, you don't like jazz?

11:00.728 --> 11:03.163
It's Saturday night.
Maybe something with words?

11:03.263 --> 11:04.564
Oh, yeah.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.266
- Yeah, I can-- sure.
- Yeah.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.501
Paparazzo:
Over here, please.
Big smile.

11:08.601 --> 11:09.703
Thank you so much.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.004
Right here,
right here.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.774
Oh, look at
the bloody paparazzi.

11:13.874 --> 11:16.009
Scum, aren't they?

11:16.109 --> 11:18.378
All right,
wait here, gentlemen.

11:21.614 --> 11:23.250
Woman:
Oh, I'm dying to see him.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.985
Hey.
( kisses )

11:25.085 --> 11:26.619
Woman #2:
I can't believe
he said that to her.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.655
Hiya, I just want to
pop in for a quick drink.

11:28.756 --> 11:31.291
Um, just wondering,
where should I have
my driver park my limo?

11:31.391 --> 11:33.794
What is the name
on the reservation,
please?

11:33.894 --> 11:37.064
Um, I'm actually coming in
tonight without a reservation.

11:37.164 --> 11:38.732
I can't let you in
without a reservation.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.467
- All right.
- ( horns honking )

11:40.567 --> 11:42.402
I'm not sure you're following.
I just pulled up in a limousine.

11:42.502 --> 11:43.937
- Yes.
- Yeah.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.672
- I gotta move the car.
- Hang on a minute.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.040
Are you going in?

11:47.140 --> 11:48.475
- Yeah.
- No.

11:48.575 --> 11:50.143
- They're not going in?
- No.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.379
Why are you talking to her?
Ask me if you got a question.

11:52.479 --> 11:53.680
( horns continue honking )

11:53.781 --> 11:55.582
- Sorry, what was
your name?
- Jane.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.985
Jane, I'm gonna need to
speak to your manager,
I'm afraid.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.087
He is gonna tell you
the exact same thing.

12:00.187 --> 12:01.989
- All right, we shall see.
- Okay.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.456
Richard to the front
entrance, please.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.925
Richard to the front.

12:05.025 --> 12:07.160
Look, I gotta move here.
I can't stay here.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.628
Just hang on.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.397
You have to move.
He's blocking everything.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.066
What's he blocking, your view
of Kim Kardashian's vagina?

12:13.166 --> 12:15.235
I'm just gonna drive
around the block.

12:15.335 --> 12:18.071
No, don't go round the block
'cause I need the manager
to see the-- just--

12:18.171 --> 12:21.108
- What?
- Pull in here. Come in this
alleyway. Just pull in there.

12:21.208 --> 12:22.742
- ( door closes )
- Good evening.

12:22.843 --> 12:23.977
- Hello, you the manager?
- I am.

12:24.077 --> 12:24.978
Hi, yeah, I was
just talking to...

12:25.078 --> 12:26.947
- Jane.
- Jane...

12:27.047 --> 12:28.916
and she seems to think
I can't pop in
for a quick drink.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.617
Really?
Do you have
a reservation?

12:30.717 --> 12:31.618
Nope,
he just walked up.

12:31.718 --> 12:33.020
I didn't just walk up.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.922
I was actually just
chauffeured up in that.

12:35.022 --> 12:37.724
- In a town car?
- No, that's a limousine, you--

12:37.825 --> 12:39.793
Does anyone in your limousine
have a reservation?

12:39.893 --> 12:41.161
Right, um...

12:41.261 --> 12:42.796
didn't want to have
to mention this,

12:42.896 --> 12:45.866
but maybe I'm quite
well-known in the UK.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.735
- Want me to Google him?
- There's no Googling.
There's no need to Google.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.270
You're famous
in England?

12:51.304 --> 12:52.806
Ahem. Eh.

12:52.906 --> 12:54.507
Sure, well,
we have a number of
British employees.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.276
If I were to bring one down,
they would know who you are?

12:56.376 --> 12:58.378
Eh.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.547
- Neville, please report--
- Let's just keep Neville
out of it, all right?

13:00.647 --> 13:02.749
Do you know what?
I'm not gonna jump
through your hoops.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.151
I'd like you to
notify your owner

13:04.251 --> 13:06.987
that you just turned away
Stuart Pritchard.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.922
- Sorry, Stuart...
- Pritchard.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.124
- I'm Googling him.
- Why are you
getting involved?

13:11.224 --> 13:12.860
It's nothing
to do with you.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.561
Just remember that face

13:14.661 --> 13:16.396
'cause you'll be
apologizing to it later.

13:16.496 --> 13:17.898
Nothing on Google.

13:17.998 --> 13:20.400
It's nothing to do
with you, is it?

13:25.338 --> 13:26.473
Pathetic.

13:26.573 --> 13:27.774
You're pathetic,
if anyone is.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.576
Just drive the car,
please.

13:29.676 --> 13:32.212
Yeah, I can't see the street.
You're gonna have
to guide me out.

13:32.312 --> 13:35.048
You're a professional driver.
Just reverse.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.750
I can't go into the traffic
'cause I can't see anything.

13:37.851 --> 13:40.353
Get out of the way.
Out of the way.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.191
Sir, I told you
you can't come in.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.926
I'm not
coming back in, am I?

13:46.026 --> 13:47.560
I'm moving the limousine.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.062
Hang on, hang on,
hang on, hang on.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.398
- ( horns honking )
- Hang on a minute.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.768
Just hang on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

13:55.869 --> 13:57.037
( horns continue honking )

13:57.137 --> 13:58.939
What's the point
of honking?

13:59.039 --> 14:02.609
I've got a limousine.
There's no point honking.

14:02.709 --> 14:05.078
Why you taking pictures?
Who you gonna sell them to?

14:05.178 --> 14:07.948
It's for my private
collection.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.483
You can honk all you like.
There's a limousine here.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.019
It was a limo.

14:12.119 --> 14:15.422
Remember this face,
mate, all right?
Remember it.

14:16.689 --> 14:20.093
- Open the door!
- Oh, my God.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.995
( honking continues )

14:24.898 --> 14:26.533
It's definitely
about hormones,

14:26.633 --> 14:28.268
and they change
every seven years
in a seven-year cycle,

14:28.368 --> 14:30.103
so I used to have to wash
my hair every three days.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.139
Now I have to wash it
every day.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.774
Wow. They say you're
only supposed to do it
every other day.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.876
Hey, who wants
to watch a film?

14:36.977 --> 14:39.346
Oh, my God, you know what
I watched the other night
and it's still great?

14:39.446 --> 14:41.114
- What?
- "10 Things I Hate
About You."

14:41.214 --> 14:43.816
- Oh, Heath Ledger.
You guys.
- I know.

14:43.917 --> 14:47.020
Well, actually,
I had a film in mind.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.557
"Battleship Potemkin."

14:50.657 --> 14:51.724
Hmm?

14:51.824 --> 14:53.860
Oh, is that the one
with Rihanna?

14:53.961 --> 14:56.296
Oh, no.
You're thinking
of "Battleship."

14:56.396 --> 14:58.798
Uh, this is
"Battleship Potemkin."

14:58.898 --> 15:03.403
Apparently, it is "one of
the most important films
of all time."

15:03.503 --> 15:05.272
Who's in it?

15:05.372 --> 15:06.639
Uh...

15:06.739 --> 15:09.342
Mikhail Gomorov,

15:09.442 --> 15:12.179
Vladimir Uralsky,

15:12.279 --> 15:18.485
and, oh--
Aleksanteri Ahola-Valo.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.624
* 'Cause we clubbin'
and we buzzin' *

15:24.724 --> 15:27.894
* Yes, we gonna get it here
till the nightfall *

15:27.995 --> 15:29.162
* There's nothing else...

15:29.262 --> 15:31.464
Hello, ladies.
Where the party at?

15:31.564 --> 15:33.000
Up your ass.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.135
Just-- don't talk like that
in front of ladies.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.703
What, you want
to fucking stop me?

15:38.305 --> 15:39.772
No.

15:39.872 --> 15:41.041
( laughs )

15:41.141 --> 15:42.842
This is so much fun.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.511
We should rent a limo
every week.

15:47.014 --> 15:49.116
Hey, ladies.
Where you heading?

15:49.216 --> 15:50.717
We don't know.
We're from St. Louis.

15:50.817 --> 15:52.085
We're here to party.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.886
- ( all cheer )
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:53.987 --> 15:55.788
This is the best party
in L.A. right in here.

15:55.888 --> 15:57.757
Just three dudes
having fun.
Nothing weird.

15:57.857 --> 15:59.059
We're not
getting in there.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.427
Oh, come on.
We've got free booze!

16:00.527 --> 16:02.095
Well, no, the booze
is not free.

16:02.195 --> 16:03.263
They're actually
charging us for the booze,

16:03.363 --> 16:04.597
but you can
still have some.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.133
All right,
stop, stop, stop.

16:06.233 --> 16:07.600
Listen, I guarantee you
one of you was just
complaining

16:07.700 --> 16:08.968
about having to walk
in those heels, right?

16:09.069 --> 16:10.937
This water's
free, though.

16:11.038 --> 16:12.905
Okay, wait, wait.
How do we know you're
not just gonna attack us?

16:13.006 --> 16:14.541
- Yeah.
- Please, definitely not.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.109
We're harmless.
We are not going
to attack you.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.211
We're nice guys.
I'm disabled...

16:18.311 --> 16:19.779
- Yeah.
- and this guy's got
no upper body strength.

16:19.879 --> 16:21.214
None whatsoever.
I'm pathetic.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.283
I don't know.
Come on.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.617
Listen,
you're on vacation.

16:24.717 --> 16:25.885
Have an adventure.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.787
Come on,
don't make me beg.

16:27.887 --> 16:29.689
( pants )

16:29.789 --> 16:30.723
( laughing )

16:30.823 --> 16:32.692
- Hold on.
- We are disabled.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.928
If you've got any CDs,
there's a CD player
in here as well.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.830
Okay, one drink.

16:37.930 --> 16:38.998
- Whoo!
- Oh, all right.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.468
Come on in.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.770
* It's going down
'cause we clubbin'
and we buzzin' *

16:43.870 --> 16:46.106
* Yes, we gonna get it here
till the nightfall *

16:46.206 --> 16:49.042
* If nothing else, lose
yourself, get outta control *

16:49.142 --> 16:52.279
* A lotta cruisin'
with music and alcohol... *

16:52.379 --> 16:54.681
( violin music playing )

17:08.561 --> 17:11.431
I think I'm gonna
get some more wine.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.468
Yeah, I need
a refill, too.

17:23.976 --> 17:25.645
( wine pours )

17:28.047 --> 17:30.383
( women laughing )

17:36.356 --> 17:38.358
Hey, should I--
should I pause the movie?

17:38.458 --> 17:42.129
We were talking,
and, um...

17:42.229 --> 17:44.964
it's Saturday night,
and we were thinking

17:45.064 --> 17:47.700
maybe we should
just go out.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.270
Okay, yeah.
I know the movie
was kind of heavy.

17:50.370 --> 17:51.971
- No, it was amazing.
- I really like the movie.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.340
I definitely
want to rent it again.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.841
I just didn't
like it tonight.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.643
Woman #3:
Russia looks beautiful.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.645
Oh.
( chuckles )

17:58.745 --> 18:01.614
So, what do you guys
want to do instead?

18:01.714 --> 18:03.783
- Bottoms up? Hey!
- Whoa!

18:04.984 --> 18:06.386
- Ah!
- Oh.

18:06.486 --> 18:07.620
You guys.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.157
Hey, let's get a photograph
of this happy moment.

18:10.257 --> 18:11.424
- Woman: Oh, just us?
- Stuart: Yeah, yeah.

18:11.524 --> 18:14.161
- Oh!
- ( shutter clicks )

18:14.261 --> 18:16.196
Oh, I didn't--
that one didn't come out,

18:16.296 --> 18:17.464
so we better
do that one again.

18:17.564 --> 18:20.167
No, uh, no.
Get another
couple of these.

18:20.267 --> 18:23.370
Yeah, you're--
she's wise to
my little plan.

18:23.470 --> 18:24.737
- The party has begun.
- Oh, yeah, more.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.739
Is it true what they say
about men with big feet?

18:26.839 --> 18:28.208
Yes, it is.
It is.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.177
We have great trouble
finding shoes that fit.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.512
- That's not what I meant.
- I know exactly
what you meant, madam.

18:32.612 --> 18:36.015
- Let me try one on.
- You are trying to get me
undressed, methinks.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.517
Yes, well,
you found out my secret.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.219
- ( phone rings )
- ( laughs )

18:39.319 --> 18:41.254
Hang on a minute.
Sorry, excuse me.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.122
Keep it quick.
What do you want?

18:43.223 --> 18:45.492
The salon is over.

18:45.592 --> 18:48.161
We had a very
stimulating time,

18:48.261 --> 18:50.497
but we were wondering

18:50.597 --> 18:54.367
if we could come
join you in the limo.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.569
What, you
or your friends?

18:56.669 --> 18:57.504
Both.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.406
But definitely
your friends.

18:59.506 --> 19:00.407
Yes.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.542
Tell the girls
I'm on my way.

19:02.642 --> 19:06.145
It's nice, but I'm afraid
it could get stuck on there
and then drop it.

19:06.246 --> 19:09.282
- Good news.
- ( all cheer )

19:09.382 --> 19:11.851
Ladies,
your chariot awaits.

19:11.951 --> 19:13.520
Ooh.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.955
Thank you so much.
You're so cool.

19:16.055 --> 19:17.990
You're so cool.
Get in there, you.

19:18.090 --> 19:19.759
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.331
( sighs )

19:25.198 --> 19:27.800
( all cheering )

19:31.971 --> 19:33.240
How much fun is this?

19:33.340 --> 19:34.907
How much fun
are we having, huh?

19:35.007 --> 19:37.277
Cheers.
Cheers.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.279
- Cheers, cheers.
- Cheers.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.014
You may have noticed,

19:42.114 --> 19:43.383
I've actually got
a hot tub at my place.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.117
We could always pop back
later and tub it up.

19:45.218 --> 19:47.153
- Wade, am I wrong?
- Wade: No, he's right.

19:47.254 --> 19:49.989
- Yeah, see?
- He's right. How much fun
are we having tonight?

19:50.089 --> 19:52.992
So, is this, like,
a typical Saturday night
in Hollywood?

19:53.092 --> 19:54.294
You know, renting a limo?

19:54.394 --> 19:55.962
Or is this
a special occasion?

19:56.062 --> 19:59.198
Well, I--
actually I hired this
for me and my wife,

19:59.299 --> 20:02.302
but, um-- but,
yeah, she couldn't
make it, so...

20:02.402 --> 20:03.503
- Oh.
- Yeah.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.838
She lets you
party without her, huh?

20:05.938 --> 20:09.208
- Your wife rocks.
- Yeah. Yeah, she does.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.443
Kives:
I'm gonna make
another toast.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.245
- Hollywood nights!
- Whoo, yeah!

20:12.345 --> 20:14.547
Wade:
You know, I, um--

20:14.647 --> 20:16.449
I'm-- actually, I think
I'm gonna go sit up front
for a little bit.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.385
I'm-- I'm feeling
carsick.

20:18.485 --> 20:22.021
- Oh.
- Yeah, could you pull over
just for a second?

20:22.121 --> 20:23.523
- Thanks so much.
- Really?

20:31.030 --> 20:32.465
Oh, you can go.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.033
Oh, could you
put the divider up?

20:34.133 --> 20:35.802
Oh, sure.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.944
( sighs )

20:45.044 --> 20:47.614
( sobbing )

20:59.025 --> 21:00.226
Well, that was weird.

21:00.327 --> 21:02.829
( laughs )

21:02.929 --> 21:04.096
That's never
happened before.

21:04.196 --> 21:06.132
Mm.

21:06.232 --> 21:08.868
( groans )
Boy, traffic.

21:08.968 --> 21:10.403
I know.

21:10.503 --> 21:11.771
Everybody's out tonight.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.072
- Sure seems like it, right?
- It does.

21:13.172 --> 21:14.240
Oh, yes, it's--

21:14.341 --> 21:15.442
Have you--
you been to London?

21:15.542 --> 21:16.909
- No.
- Never been?

21:17.009 --> 21:18.578
It's great.
I've been twice.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.112
- Yeah, it is.
- The closest I got

21:20.212 --> 21:22.649
was I spent a summer
in Ireland doing this
horror movie.

21:22.749 --> 21:25.084
Oh, wow, really?
Where in Ireland?

21:25.184 --> 21:26.353
Dublin.

21:26.453 --> 21:27.954
- Whereabouts in Dublin?
- Blackrock.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.823
- Blackrock, really?
What street?
- Leeson Street.

21:30.923 --> 21:33.192
- Leeson Street?
- Yeah, do you know it?

21:33.292 --> 21:34.461
No, I've never
been to Dublin.

21:34.561 --> 21:36.429
But I've always
wanted to go.

21:36.529 --> 21:38.831
- I've been to Ireland.
- Good for you.

21:38.931 --> 21:41.568
Isn't it weird that
you spent all that time
in Ireland

21:41.668 --> 21:43.603
and I'm from England
and they're sort of
neighbors?

21:43.703 --> 21:45.672
It's quite
a weird coincidence.

21:45.772 --> 21:47.607
My grandmother
was born in London.

21:47.707 --> 21:49.141
How's that
for a coincidence?

21:49.241 --> 21:50.677
Um...

21:51.878 --> 21:53.513
So, tell me more
about this horror movie.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.582
Um, Maxine's
at the Prada party
at Ambassador Room.

21:55.682 --> 21:57.249
- We should go.
- Amazing.

21:57.350 --> 21:59.118
I love the Ambassador Room.
I was there earlier.

21:59.218 --> 22:01.153
( whispers )
I just don't think that
we can get everyone in.

22:01.253 --> 22:03.122
Listen, why don't
the four of us go in

22:03.222 --> 22:06.426
and we'll leave the limo
with the tourists
and the disabled guy?

22:06.526 --> 22:08.294
Sure.
Yeah, that's cool.

22:08.395 --> 22:09.896
Um, okay.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.432
- Hey, there she is.
- It's tight in here.

22:12.532 --> 22:14.667
It is tight, it is tight,
it is tight.

22:17.103 --> 22:18.771
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

22:18.871 --> 22:20.172
Nice to meet you.

22:20.272 --> 22:21.974
Thank you.

22:22.074 --> 22:23.643
Should we come in?

22:23.743 --> 22:25.578
Uh, no, um,
unfortunately,
it's guest list only,

22:25.678 --> 22:28.147
but, uh...
enjoy the rest of your trip.
Nice to meet you.

22:28.247 --> 22:29.816
Bye, cheers.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.117
- I'll hold down
the fort. Buh-bye.
- ( scoffs )

22:31.217 --> 22:32.885
Oh, you look so cute.
Come on in.

22:32.985 --> 22:34.887
- You look skinny.
- Jane: You guys
look adorable.

22:34.987 --> 22:36.489
Oh, this schmuck again.

22:36.589 --> 22:39.125
Sir, I told you,
you can't come in
without a reservation.

22:39.225 --> 22:41.093
Uh, no, I don't
have a reservation,

22:41.193 --> 22:42.995
but I'm actually with
these ladies and they do
have a reservation.

22:43.095 --> 22:45.932
- Ladies, I'm with you, right?
- Yeah, he's with us.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.166
All right?

22:47.266 --> 22:49.569
Who's the schmuck now?

22:51.704 --> 22:53.740
Hey, why are you
ditching the teachers?

22:53.840 --> 22:55.842
- 'Cause I really
like Nikki.
- Yeah.

22:55.942 --> 22:57.744
I know I say this a lot,
but I've been talking to her

22:57.844 --> 22:59.378
and I think she's
got a real kind of
emotional intelligence,

22:59.479 --> 23:01.047
and I felt like we connected
on quite a sort of--

23:01.147 --> 23:03.416
I don't know,
quite a profound level.
You know what I mean?

23:03.516 --> 23:05.552
You know she has
a boyfriend, right?

23:05.652 --> 23:07.887
- What about Ashley?
- She has a fiancé.

23:07.987 --> 23:11.558
- Lisa?
- She wants you to stop
staring at her chest.

23:11.658 --> 23:13.660
Well, then, she should
wear a bra that fits.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.161
Why didn't you give me
this intel before?

23:15.261 --> 23:17.530
I had a sure thing
in the limo.

23:17.630 --> 23:19.331
Oh, for fuck's sake.

23:19.432 --> 23:20.733
Out of the way!

23:23.736 --> 23:25.972
Oh, I love
this fucking idiot.

23:26.072 --> 23:29.642
Wait! Wait,
Kives, stop!

23:37.183 --> 23:38.851
Listen.

23:49.529 --> 23:52.231
Hello.
( panting )

23:52.331 --> 23:54.867
I was at this other party,
and I thought,

23:54.967 --> 23:58.938
"What am I doing here?
This is where the party's at."

23:59.038 --> 24:00.039
So I'm back.

24:02.675 --> 24:04.877
What were you talking about?
The time that you guys
kissed in college?

24:04.977 --> 24:08.080
- Woman: Oh, no, no.
- Kives: Do you wanna kiss now?

24:08.180 --> 24:10.850
- Woman: No!
- Woman #2: We're gonna
need some more champagne.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.485
So, how long were you
in London for?

24:12.585 --> 24:15.454
- Fuck off.
- Yep.

24:25.264 --> 24:28.434
( chatter )

24:28.535 --> 24:30.102
Hey, Wade. You sure
you don't want to join us?

24:30.202 --> 24:31.604
No, no, I'm beat.

24:31.704 --> 24:33.339
All right. Good night, buddy.
I'll call you tomorrow.

24:33.439 --> 24:34.807
Be safe, all right?

24:34.907 --> 24:37.577
- After party!
- ( laughing )

24:38.545 --> 24:41.247
Woman:
St. Louis!

24:41.347 --> 24:43.816
St. Louis!

24:43.916 --> 24:46.285
( chatter )

24:46.385 --> 24:49.589
Why do they have to
have the party here?
It's always so crowded.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.758
Yeah, they should've had it
at Bootsy Bellows.

24:51.858 --> 24:53.259
( gasps )
Oh, have you been
to Pour Vous?

24:53.359 --> 24:54.827
It's the same guys
that do Bootsy's.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.495
No, no, no.
You're thinking
of Shore Club.

24:56.596 --> 24:58.798
Pour Vous
is the same guys
as Harvard & Stone.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.733
I haven't been
to Harvard & Stone.
Should I go?

25:00.833 --> 25:02.301
Yeah, it's good
on Wednesdays.

25:02.401 --> 25:03.836
Maybe I'll check it out.

25:03.936 --> 25:05.237
Yeah, you know, actually,
it's pretty good.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.939
You might like it,
you might not.

25:07.039 --> 25:08.340
Hey, you guys.
I think I'm gonna go.

25:08.440 --> 25:09.508
- Oh, why?
- Wait, no.

25:09.609 --> 25:10.977
Yeah, I'm tired.

25:16.949 --> 25:19.418
All right, well,
see you later, mate.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.654
I can't go 30 days
without talking to Marion.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.322
It's gonna be hard.

25:23.422 --> 25:25.625
Well, you made it through
today, no problem, didn't ya?

25:25.725 --> 25:27.426
Actually,
I had to go up front
and cry for a while.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.295
- Did you? Oh.
- Yeah.

25:29.395 --> 25:31.130
Well, thanks for
doing it up front and not
in front of the women.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.899
Well, yeah, I--
you know, I thought
it might ruin the mood.

25:32.999 --> 25:34.200
- Definitely would've.
- Yeah.

25:34.300 --> 25:35.802
I appreciate that,
thanks.

25:35.902 --> 25:37.870
But, uh, listen.
You know,
if you need to talk,

25:37.970 --> 25:40.707
- I'm here for ya.
- Thank you.

25:40.807 --> 25:42.274
Unless there's women around,
in which case, obviously--

25:42.374 --> 25:43.409
- Of course.
- keep quiet.

25:43.509 --> 25:44.977
No, I wouldn't.
I wouldn't.

25:45.077 --> 25:48.314
- Okay. Come here.
- Okay. Oh!
There he goes.

25:48.414 --> 25:50.182
- All right.
- Okay.

25:50.282 --> 25:51.483
- Come here.
- Oh.

25:51.584 --> 25:53.653
- Thank you.
- Give him one as well.

25:53.753 --> 25:55.755
- All right. See ya.
- I'll see ya.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.260
All right.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.229
Home, Jeeves.

26:05.765 --> 26:08.267
* I heard you caught
a falling star *

26:08.367 --> 26:11.203
* Down on
Sunset Boulevard *

26:11.303 --> 26:14.774
* What a souvenir

26:16.643 --> 26:19.245
* It only sparkled
for the night *

26:19.345 --> 26:21.814
* And when you held it
in the light *

26:21.914 --> 26:25.317
* The glitter disappeared

26:28.520 --> 26:31.991
* Look who's lonely now

26:32.091 --> 26:36.262
* Welcome to
the other side *

26:36.362 --> 26:37.797
( phone chimes )

26:39.398 --> 26:42.835
* Look who's lonely now

26:42.935 --> 26:47.106
* You know my arms
are open wide *

26:49.475 --> 26:51.778
* There's
a lot of fun uptown *

26:51.878 --> 26:54.647
* That sophisticated crowd

26:54.747 --> 26:59.752
* Took you for a ride

26:59.852 --> 27:02.454
* When they finally
let you down *

27:02.554 --> 27:05.324
* There was
no one else around *

27:05.424 --> 27:08.861
* Who could sympathize

27:11.798 --> 27:15.567
* Look who's lonely now

27:15.668 --> 27:19.638
* Welcome to the other side
