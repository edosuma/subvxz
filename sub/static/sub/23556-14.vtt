00:03.204 --> 00:04.970
Careful, guys.

00:04.971 --> 00:06.538
We don't know what we might run into.

00:12.413 --> 00:13.679
All right, guys.

00:24.225 --> 00:27.760
The hacker's hideout.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.830
We found it.

00:31.832 --> 00:34.099
This is what we've been looking for.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.904
Aw, he took his computers.

00:38.906 --> 00:40.072
Careful, guys.

00:40.074 --> 00:41.173
Don't touch anything.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.246
There are cables everywhere.

00:47.248 --> 00:48.480
Hmm, anything else?

00:48.482 --> 00:50.182
No hardware, just cables.

00:50.184 --> 00:51.717
Can we take it with us?

00:51.719 --> 00:53.185
- Yes!
- No!

00:53.187 --> 00:55.621
Guys, we don't touch anything.

00:55.623 --> 00:58.390
This is a crime scene.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.832
Guys?

01:06.834 --> 01:09.334
You need to see this.

01:12.139 --> 01:14.640
Oh... whoa...

01:14.642 --> 01:17.109
This is so weird.

01:17.111 --> 01:18.777
That's a map of our house.

01:22.483 --> 01:23.882
Super Secret Room?

01:23.884 --> 01:26.485
And look... the crown.

01:26.487 --> 01:28.087
The same as on Evie's necklace.

01:28.089 --> 01:29.822
I don't understand.

01:29.824 --> 01:31.790
Do you know this room?

01:31.792 --> 01:33.225
I, I don't think so.

01:33.227 --> 01:36.628
Well, that's because it's super secret!

01:36.630 --> 01:39.398
Our house never ceases to amaze me.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.732
You guys head back to the house.

01:40.734 --> 01:43.168
I'm gonna stay here and call Simone.

01:43.170 --> 01:44.436
Yeah, I'm gonna stay with you.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.437
All right.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.438
Okay.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.372
- Be safe.
- Be safe.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.047
This... is the history
of the Hunter house.

01:55.049 --> 01:56.582
I've actually read it a few times.

01:56.584 --> 02:00.152
Anyway, it reminded me
of a passage that I read before.

02:00.154 --> 02:05.257
"Of a room of mystery deep
inside the layers of the house,

02:05.259 --> 02:09.527
"where only the most invaluable
treasures shall be hidden.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.430
"Signed...

02:11.432 --> 02:15.634
Leo Hunter, 1892."

02:15.636 --> 02:18.203
Oh, yes, crazy Uncle Leo.

02:18.205 --> 02:20.105
Erik told me about him once.

02:20.107 --> 02:21.673
He was a bit...

02:21.675 --> 02:23.275
Crazy?

02:23.277 --> 02:24.510
To put it mildly.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.345
So why do you want to know
about Uncle Leo?

02:26.347 --> 02:28.814
Oh, we wanted to know more
about the Super Secret...

02:28.816 --> 02:30.916
Super-serious family history.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.251
Okay.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.852
I'm afraid, though, I don't know

02:33.854 --> 02:36.288
too much about Uncle Leo,
but Erik would.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.223
Do you know where Erik is?

02:38.225 --> 02:39.992
He's probably out running errands,

02:39.994 --> 02:41.293
but he'll be back soon.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.928
So you know nothing on crazy Uncle Leo?

02:42.930 --> 02:43.896
I'm afraid not.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.901
I... do know...

02:48.903 --> 02:51.970
that Uncle Leo used to sleep
in what is now

02:51.972 --> 02:52.971
Sal's room.

02:52.973 --> 02:53.939
Sal's room?

02:55.142 --> 02:56.074
Cool. Bye!

03:02.683 --> 03:04.816
So, as a cop, do you have to go

03:04.818 --> 03:06.351
on a lot of high-speed chases?

03:06.353 --> 03:08.187
No, it's not like that.

03:08.189 --> 03:11.456
It's mostly just about,
you know, listening.

03:11.458 --> 03:13.625
Asking questions can get you a long way.

03:14.795 --> 03:15.961
Simon.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.129
You!

03:17.131 --> 03:18.430
I need to talk to you.

03:18.432 --> 03:21.033
I told you not to interfere
with this case again,

03:21.035 --> 03:22.100
yet here you are.

03:22.102 --> 03:23.735
I'm sorry, Simon,

03:23.737 --> 03:25.304
but we, we found something in this train

03:25.306 --> 03:27.773
and you really need to take a look.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.541
Please?

03:31.445 --> 03:32.611
All right.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.012
We'll take it from here.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.280
You guys go home.

03:35.282 --> 03:37.349
Right now.

03:41.956 --> 03:43.255
Great police work, Daniel.

03:55.502 --> 03:56.835
My room is turned upside down

03:56.837 --> 03:58.503
and we still haven't found anything.

03:58.505 --> 04:00.706
Actually, I think
your room has improved.

04:02.109 --> 04:04.142
Hmm...

04:04.144 --> 04:06.311
Maybe there's a space behind the wall.

04:06.313 --> 04:08.614
How can we find out?

04:08.616 --> 04:10.515
Um...

04:10.517 --> 04:12.451
Maybe I could use...

04:12.453 --> 04:14.886
Aha! A feather.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.188
A feather?

04:16.190 --> 04:17.956
Why do you need a feather?

04:17.958 --> 04:19.291
To see if there's a draft coming in.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.017
There we go!

05:01.201 --> 05:02.467
What's that?

05:02.469 --> 05:04.836
Looks like a tiny, little door
to a tiny mouse house.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.204
Well, it better not be.

05:06.206 --> 05:08.307
Well, it's too small to be
a door to a secret room.

05:08.309 --> 05:10.575
Yeah, we could never fit through.

05:10.577 --> 05:12.411
Maybe I can.

05:12.413 --> 05:13.979
Tess, don't take this the wrong way,

05:13.981 --> 05:15.981
but aren't you a little bit big?

05:15.983 --> 05:17.215
I mean my arm.

05:17.217 --> 05:19.117
Oh, right, your arm.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.757
Ah.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.102
You feel anything?

05:37.104 --> 05:38.303
Not yet.

05:38.305 --> 05:40.772
Maybe a tiny, little Super Secret Room?

05:40.774 --> 05:42.874
No, wait.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.142
I feel something.

05:44.144 --> 05:45.210
It's like a handle.

05:45.212 --> 05:46.345
Push it!

05:58.359 --> 05:59.791
I'm stuck.

05:59.793 --> 06:00.959
- What? No, you're not.
- No, you're not.

06:00.961 --> 06:01.960
Oh, come on.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.095
One, two, three.

06:04.098 --> 06:05.664
- Uh-oh.
- I'm pretty sure I'm stuck.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.099
I can't get my hand out!

06:07.101 --> 06:08.934
She's stuck...

06:08.936 --> 06:10.268
- I'm really stuck.
- You get it off!

06:10.270 --> 06:11.903
What... why, why me?

06:14.775 --> 06:16.742
- What's going on?
- The little thing... the door.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.310
The trap door, the mouse house,

06:18.312 --> 06:19.845
whatever, get me... it's stuck.

06:19.847 --> 06:21.747
Here...

06:21.749 --> 06:22.848
- Ah!
- Oh!

06:22.850 --> 06:25.283
Oh, oh... oh!

06:27.454 --> 06:28.453
Oh...

06:30.357 --> 06:31.790
It's obvious this Leo guy

06:31.792 --> 06:33.992
was a little paranoid.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.395
He might have rigged the entire
house with booby traps.

06:36.397 --> 06:39.064
I mean, who decides to stick their hand

06:39.066 --> 06:40.499
in a weird hatch anyway?

06:41.969 --> 06:44.970
I'm sorry, officer,
I'll be "careful" next time.

06:44.972 --> 06:47.272
I mean, I'm just trying to help, but...

06:47.274 --> 06:49.274
who knows what's hidden
beyond these walls?

06:49.276 --> 06:52.377
Maybe... an indoor pool
with a water slide.

06:52.379 --> 06:54.780
Or a roller coaster! Can I search too?

06:54.782 --> 06:57.616
Maybe that's a little
too adventurous for you, Evie.

06:57.618 --> 07:00.185
Is there maybe a fun game you can play?

07:02.589 --> 07:04.623
I'm sorry.

07:07.961 --> 07:11.163
So... what's the next move?

07:11.165 --> 07:12.431
I think we should continue searching

07:12.433 --> 07:13.732
for the Super Secret Room.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.667
This time... we'll be careful.

07:22.342 --> 07:23.442
Hey, Evie.

07:29.349 --> 07:31.683
You wanted to be part
of the adventure, right?

07:35.389 --> 07:38.356
Well, we can make our own club.

07:38.358 --> 07:41.092
We can be the... Club of Adventurers...

07:41.094 --> 07:43.361
Without an Adventure.

07:43.363 --> 07:46.731
My daddy always used to
take me on adventures.

07:46.733 --> 07:48.867
I get it.

07:48.869 --> 07:52.637
You miss your dad.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.273
Do you wanna talk about it?

07:56.743 --> 07:58.043
I want to show you something.

07:58.045 --> 07:58.977
Come on!

08:05.652 --> 08:07.853
Where are we going?

08:07.855 --> 08:09.221
You'll see.

08:09.223 --> 08:11.456
- It's a surprise.
- Oh.

08:11.458 --> 08:12.657
You're gonna love it.

08:15.429 --> 08:17.329
Whoa...

08:17.331 --> 08:18.530
A maze.

08:18.532 --> 08:20.932
Yes, that's right.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.734
Why are we here?

08:22.736 --> 08:24.135
My daddy used to take me here.

08:24.137 --> 08:27.506
We would walk and talk and...

08:27.508 --> 08:29.007
Well, show me.

08:32.613 --> 08:35.813
My daddy did all sorts
OF THINGS: caves...

08:35.816 --> 08:37.982
deep-sea dives, all very dangerous.

08:37.985 --> 08:40.150
But he was very brave.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.354
I wish my birth parents
were that interesting.

08:42.356 --> 08:44.389
Kate and Erik are interesting.

08:44.391 --> 08:48.226
Yeah, that's for sure.

08:48.228 --> 08:51.496
Here... right.

08:51.498 --> 08:53.532
Are you sure you know where we're going?

08:53.534 --> 08:56.001
It's a maze. We're not going anywhere.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.903
Right, right, but...

08:57.905 --> 09:00.005
we are gonna get
to an exit eventually...

09:00.007 --> 09:01.172
aren't we?

09:01.174 --> 09:02.474
Let's hope so.

09:12.819 --> 09:13.852
Okay, so...

09:13.854 --> 09:15.954
the trick with the feather worked.

09:15.956 --> 09:18.356
Now let's see if we can pick up a draft.

09:18.358 --> 09:19.858
Ready?

09:19.860 --> 09:21.826
Let's do it.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.339
We're never gonna find the room.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.243
Let's see... if we can find more about

09:38.245 --> 09:40.345
the Super Secret Room...

09:40.347 --> 09:42.347
in the history book of the Hunter house.

09:42.349 --> 09:43.515
That's a great idea!

09:43.517 --> 09:44.583
Let's go.

09:59.533 --> 10:02.634
Me, I always wanted to be
a comic book artist,

10:02.636 --> 10:04.703
so now I've been trying
to get my work sold and...

10:04.705 --> 10:07.038
Yeah, but they, they have to
see that it's good, you know?

10:07.040 --> 10:10.875
It has to be really... unique, I'd say.

10:10.877 --> 10:11.977
Yeah.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.678
Anyway, I like this little chat.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.013
Daniel always told me
I should listen more

10:15.015 --> 10:16.648
and, you know, I think he's right.

10:16.650 --> 10:18.950
I should...

10:18.952 --> 10:20.885
Evie?

10:20.887 --> 10:22.654
Jake?

10:22.656 --> 10:25.156
Evie?

10:25.158 --> 10:26.424
Evie, where are you?

10:26.426 --> 10:28.893
Jake, come and find me.

10:28.895 --> 10:30.195
Evie!

10:30.197 --> 10:32.697
What...?

10:34.301 --> 10:37.936
Evie... Evie!

10:37.938 --> 10:39.504
Oh, this isn't funny, Evie!

10:57.424 --> 10:59.424
It's the old telegraph machine.

10:59.426 --> 11:00.525
Oh, right, the one

11:00.527 --> 11:03.428
Erik and Kate used
last year to contact us.

11:03.430 --> 11:04.896
But why is it doing that?

11:04.898 --> 11:07.098
Someone's trying to send us a message.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.367
Why won't they just send us an email?

11:09.369 --> 11:13.038
The only people that know
it's here is... us...

11:13.040 --> 11:15.740
us Hunters and... we're all here.

11:15.742 --> 11:17.208
Except...

11:17.210 --> 11:18.476
- Max!
- Max!

11:28.088 --> 11:29.888
What does it say?

11:29.890 --> 11:31.122
What?

11:33.193 --> 11:35.360
"A...

11:35.362 --> 11:37.929
"cow...

11:37.931 --> 11:39.097
"lives...

11:39.099 --> 11:41.499
"in... a...

11:41.501 --> 11:43.401
tree."

11:44.971 --> 11:46.371
That doesn't make any sense.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.206
Or does it?

11:48.208 --> 11:52.444
Well, Max isn't very good at Morse code.

11:52.446 --> 11:55.880
This is the voicemail
of Erik Hunter.

11:55.882 --> 11:56.981
Please leave a message after the beep.

11:57.984 --> 11:59.918
I've been trying to reach Erik

11:59.920 --> 12:01.252
but he hasn't picked up his phone.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.555
Well, he's probably
meeting with his lawyer.

12:03.557 --> 12:04.556
He'll be back.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.558
Don't worry.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.159
Simon mentioned
that he tried to reach him.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.095
He was pretty angry.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.330
You know Erik is, is not allowed

12:12.332 --> 12:14.999
- to leave the country or anything, right?
- Why would he?

12:15.001 --> 12:16.701
Right.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.803
Still, I mean...

12:18.805 --> 12:19.971
maybe we should be looking for him.

12:19.973 --> 12:22.774
Erik will be back.

12:22.776 --> 12:23.775
I promise.

12:23.777 --> 12:25.410
I know.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.811
And you're doing great.

12:26.813 --> 12:29.414
I know you're doing everything you can.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.650
Well, I'm allowed to spend time
with my family, of course.

12:32.652 --> 12:35.920
I just... can't help with
the investigation anymore.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.889
And of course we won't ask you to.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.694
Another message from Max.

12:47.834 --> 12:52.971
"A... hundred... cows...
eat... flowers."

12:52.973 --> 12:55.173
Maybe he's writing a song.

12:55.175 --> 12:58.676
So you guys stopped searching
for the Super Secret Room?

12:58.678 --> 13:00.245
Actually, we're talking to Max.

13:00.247 --> 13:01.513
If you can call it that.

13:01.515 --> 13:02.514
Yeah.

13:02.516 --> 13:05.383
His Morse code is a little rusty.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.985
"A cow lives in a tree"?

13:06.987 --> 13:08.453
It's kinda beautiful, right?

13:08.455 --> 13:09.854
Like a poem.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.369
Just one word.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.672
"Danger."

13:29.376 --> 13:30.441
Anything else?

13:32.312 --> 13:34.879
That's it.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.084
Evie?

13:40.086 --> 13:42.520
I'm gonna get you out.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.289
Don't worry, I'll come and find you.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.291
Uh...

13:46.293 --> 13:50.128
Don't worry, I'm right here.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.230
Wherever that might be.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.835
Where are you?

13:56.837 --> 13:58.002
- Evie?
- Jake...

13:58.004 --> 14:00.572
Come and find me.

14:00.574 --> 14:03.041
Evie, you're going
in the wrong direction!

14:06.613 --> 14:08.046
Or maybe I am.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.818
Jake... I'm here.

14:13.820 --> 14:14.986
I'm not lost.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.087
Evie?

14:19.926 --> 14:20.959
Evie, where are you?

14:20.961 --> 14:23.728
I'm at the exit. I won!

14:23.730 --> 14:25.997
Oh, good, good, okay.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.732
I, I was looking for you.

14:27.734 --> 14:28.933
I'll get there too then, yeah?

14:28.935 --> 14:29.934
To the exit.

14:29.936 --> 14:30.935
Which I can find.

14:30.937 --> 14:31.936
Easily.

14:31.938 --> 14:33.538
So... what do you see?

14:33.540 --> 14:36.207
Oh, no, I don't need your help.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.910
I'll find it.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.645
Okay, I might need a little bit of help.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.881
I see a lot of, uh... maze.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.148
Look closer.

14:44.150 --> 14:46.684
Do you see anything out of the ordinary?

14:46.686 --> 14:48.086
Yeah.

14:48.088 --> 14:50.288
Yeah, there's, like, a, a twig
sticking out of the bush

14:50.290 --> 14:51.322
with yellow leaves.

14:51.324 --> 14:52.991
Good, I was just there.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.492
Do you see anything else?

14:54.494 --> 14:55.994
Like footsteps or a branch?

14:55.996 --> 14:57.328
Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a,

14:57.330 --> 14:59.597
there's a green twig here on the floor.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.833
Good. Follow that direction.

15:01.835 --> 15:03.368
Do you see something else?

15:04.771 --> 15:06.571
Yeah, another twig
sticking out of the tree,

15:06.573 --> 15:07.639
yellow leaves.

15:07.641 --> 15:09.274
Then follow that.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.042
Do you hear my voice getting closer?

15:11.044 --> 15:13.878
Follow the sound...

15:13.880 --> 15:15.980
How do you know this maze so well?

15:15.982 --> 15:19.884
I told you, my dad used to
take me here every week.

15:19.886 --> 15:21.252
And I'm a tracker.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.755
I'm always checking for things
out of the ordinary.

15:23.757 --> 15:25.523
Wow...

15:25.525 --> 15:27.659
I go to school every day
and I still sometimes get lost.

15:27.661 --> 15:29.527
You're almost there.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.496
All right, Evie.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.064
Where are you?

15:33.066 --> 15:36.234
Jake, I'm here.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.102
Ah, hey.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.737
Wow. You...

15:39.739 --> 15:40.972
are a very good tracker.

15:40.974 --> 15:44.509
And you're a pretty good listener.

15:45.845 --> 15:47.612
When your life depends on it.

15:49.883 --> 15:51.049
Yeah.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.517
Let's go home.

15:58.124 --> 16:01.192
Maybe crazy Uncle Leo was just that.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.661
- What?
- Crazy.

16:03.663 --> 16:08.066
The Super Secret Room must be
somewhere around here.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.301
We've searched everywhere.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.603
Did you know we have an extra bathroom

16:12.605 --> 16:14.072
just for when someone
from the royal family

16:14.074 --> 16:15.239
comes to visit us?

16:15.241 --> 16:16.741
The Royal Loo. I knew that.

16:16.743 --> 16:17.909
Oh.

16:17.911 --> 16:19.377
Hey, guys.

16:19.379 --> 16:20.878
Hey. Where'd you guys go?

16:20.880 --> 16:23.448
Well, we did
a little exploring ourselves.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.483
Did you find the Super Secret Room yet?

16:25.485 --> 16:27.118
No, we looked everywhere.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.754
Well, maybe Evie should
have a crack at it.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.155
She's a really good explorer.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.623
Why? It's no use.

16:32.625 --> 16:33.858
Oh, come on.

16:33.860 --> 16:34.826
One more try.

16:37.297 --> 16:38.363
Okay.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.800
Guys, we've searched the entire hallway

16:42.802 --> 16:46.137
and we haven't found anything.

16:55.749 --> 16:57.849
Look at the picture.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.317
Oh, that's Leo Hunter and his wife.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.352
It's a little out of place.

17:03.957 --> 17:05.857
Yeah. It looks like

17:05.858 --> 17:07.657
there's something hidden behind it.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.493
What is it?

17:09.496 --> 17:13.164
Looks like some kind of... button.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.499
Wow...

17:14.501 --> 17:16.800
Evie, how did you see that?

17:16.803 --> 17:19.337
Because Evie is a really good tracker.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.305
The absolute best.

17:21.307 --> 17:23.174
Well, what are we waiting for?

17:23.175 --> 17:24.242
Let's push it.

17:38.358 --> 17:39.991
It's a door.

17:56.042 --> 17:59.377
So, this is the Super Secret Room?

17:59.379 --> 18:01.512
More like Super Dirty Room.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.981
I guess the cleaning lady
couldn't find this one either.

18:03.983 --> 18:05.083
Or the cleaning man.

18:07.187 --> 18:10.621
Why would the hacker
be interested in this?

18:10.623 --> 18:13.524
Maybe this is all... very expensive.

18:16.162 --> 18:19.530
So why did he mark a crown
symbol on the map?

18:22.368 --> 18:25.503
"When daylight reaches
its highest point...

18:25.505 --> 18:29.340
the time has come
for the crown to shine."

18:30.910 --> 18:32.743
Daylight... crown...

18:32.745 --> 18:34.245
The pictures!

18:39.385 --> 18:40.918
Help me out here.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.054
Uh... light... crown...

18:44.691 --> 18:46.924
This is the drawing we got
from the cryptex

18:46.926 --> 18:50.361
and this is the drawing
we got from the puzzle box.

18:50.363 --> 18:55.333
"When the daylight reaches
its highest point..."

18:55.335 --> 18:57.101
What are you doing?

18:57.103 --> 18:58.803
Inspecting the fibers.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.539
Maybe the paper has
photosensitive properties.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.875
Or maybe it changes
in different lighting.

19:03.877 --> 19:05.109
Or, no, no...

19:05.111 --> 19:07.011
Maybe the fibers are gyroscopic,

19:07.013 --> 19:10.581
created by ancient
gravity-sensitive nano-fibers!

19:10.583 --> 19:11.682
Oh...

19:14.554 --> 19:16.921
"When daylight reaches
its highest point."

19:16.923 --> 19:18.990
Maybe something happens
when I hold it up high.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.558
I don't think that's even possible.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.859
You're right.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.194
Maybe it's pressure-sensitive.

19:23.196 --> 19:25.830
The sun... up... higher.

19:25.832 --> 19:26.831
We have to go even higher.

19:26.833 --> 19:27.999
To the roof.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.234
I think it's just
a normal piece of paper.

19:30.236 --> 19:32.236
What about "The time has come

19:32.238 --> 19:34.105
for the crown to shine"?

19:34.107 --> 19:36.974
Of course.

19:36.976 --> 19:39.844
The crown symbol is light-activated!

19:39.846 --> 19:40.978
So smart of those relatives.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.914
Hey, calm down, Professor Crazy Talk.

19:42.916 --> 19:45.283
I think all these puzzles
may have gone to your head.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.985
Or maybe we need to launch
the sun at the sun!

19:47.987 --> 19:49.153
We'll need a rocket.

19:49.155 --> 19:50.555
Okay, listen.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.356
We need to simplify things.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.025
It's one of the things
I learned as a policeman.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.993
How do we do that?

19:55.995 --> 19:57.895
You know, be objective.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.030
Analyze the facts.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.097
That's what scientists do.

20:00.099 --> 20:01.499
And that's what cops do.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.669
What's taking you guys so long?

20:04.671 --> 20:07.405
We don't have all the time in the world.

20:07.407 --> 20:10.208
Time.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.475
What?

20:11.477 --> 20:13.144
"The time has come."

20:15.715 --> 20:18.516
Guys, I got it.

20:18.518 --> 20:21.619
"When daylight reaches
its highest point...

20:21.621 --> 20:24.755
the time has come
for the crown to shine."

20:24.757 --> 20:27.058
So?

20:27.060 --> 20:28.793
At what time does daylight
reach its highest point?

20:28.795 --> 20:30.061
Noon.

20:30.063 --> 20:32.096
Exactly. At high noon.

20:32.098 --> 20:35.132
Boy, Daniel, you're
a really great detective.

20:35.134 --> 20:37.935
Yes! Our big brother's back on the team.

20:44.644 --> 20:47.278
These are doors.

20:58.358 --> 21:01.025
Now we're talking.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.229
Is that...?

21:05.231 --> 21:06.864
Yes.

21:18.144 --> 21:19.777
Whoa...

21:19.779 --> 21:21.112
Don't touch it.

21:21.114 --> 21:23.547
Got it.

21:25.351 --> 21:27.818
So you found the room.

21:34.327 --> 21:35.626
Erik...

21:35.628 --> 21:37.495
I believe...

21:37.497 --> 21:39.897
I owe you all an explanation.
