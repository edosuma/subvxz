WEBVTT

00:03.742 --> 00:05.614
The Mashriq Army has only ever
attacked live military targets.

00:05.657 --> 00:07.572
I mean, we never
even considered

00:07.616 --> 00:10.184
the possibility they might
go after a museum vessel.

00:10.227 --> 00:11.968
Terrible...
Watch out!

00:13.056 --> 00:14.710
NELSON:
Hey, are you okay?

00:14.753 --> 00:16.842
Nelson!

00:16.886 --> 00:18.670
DEEKS: Who is he? ERIC: Abbas Jalal.

00:18.714 --> 00:20.890
NELL:
Wasim Ghulam has met with him
on multiple occasions,

00:20.933 --> 00:22.370
always in a different place.

00:22.413 --> 00:23.849
I guess I missed
something.

00:23.893 --> 00:25.547
That's why I think we
should bring in somebody else.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.723
Her name came up while I was
researching the Mashriq Army.

00:27.766 --> 00:29.725
Special Agent Fatima Namazi.

00:29.768 --> 00:31.857
If the Mashriq Army thought
it was worth the risk

00:31.901 --> 00:34.469
to free Jalal, he must
be important, huh?If they took Jalal,

00:34.512 --> 00:36.210
it's because they need him
for something.

00:36.253 --> 00:37.385
Another attack.

00:37.428 --> 00:39.430
I got eyes on Jalal.

00:39.474 --> 00:42.042
Federal agents!
Everyone stay back!

00:42.085 --> 00:43.130
Show us your hands, Jalal.

00:49.440 --> 00:50.920
FATIMA:
You need to see this.

00:50.963 --> 00:53.227
I've been monitoring the Mashriq
Army's online presence.

00:53.270 --> 00:54.619
They just posted this.

00:54.663 --> 00:57.970
You have just felt
the wrath of the Mashriq Army.

00:58.014 --> 01:00.234
No one is safe.

01:00.277 --> 01:02.453
DEEKS:
We got two more exits
wired with explosives.

01:02.497 --> 01:03.628
They're checking the last one
right now,

01:03.672 --> 01:05.065
but it's probably
the same thing.

01:05.108 --> 01:06.327
I don't think

01:06.370 --> 01:08.720
you're getting out of there
any time soon.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.599
There's got to be
an exit somewhere.

01:17.642 --> 01:20.036
Elias, we should
just go back.
No way.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.472
Just let me think.

01:21.516 --> 01:23.387
MORALES :
Please gather in the lobby.

01:23.431 --> 01:26.434
The police have directed us
to not open

01:26.477 --> 01:28.610
any of the exit doors.

01:28.653 --> 01:30.786
Move to the theater lobby
immediately.

01:30.829 --> 01:31.874
You heard them.

01:31.917 --> 01:33.615
Come on, let's go.Eddie,

01:33.658 --> 01:35.791
we shouldn't be at the movies--
we're supposed to be at school.

01:35.834 --> 01:38.141
Mom's gonna kill us if
she found out we ditched.

01:39.186 --> 01:40.970
Okay. Yeah.

01:41.013 --> 01:43.755
Hey! I see an exit sign.

01:46.454 --> 01:48.717
MAN:
Get what you can, boys.

01:54.026 --> 01:55.071
It's all free today.

02:26.450 --> 02:28.017
Give me a sitrep.

02:28.060 --> 02:30.019
Third bomb just went off
at the backstage exit.

02:30.062 --> 02:31.238
Callen and Sam
still in there?

02:31.281 --> 02:32.674
Sam's in the lobby
helping the wounded.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.676
Callen just left to get eyes
on that third bomb.

02:34.719 --> 02:36.417
This whole theater
could be wired to explode.

02:36.460 --> 02:38.332
Well, that's a possibility, but
the only thing we know for sure

02:38.375 --> 02:39.855
is that the exits are
where people are dying,

02:39.898 --> 02:41.465
so everyone's got to
stay inside for now,

02:41.509 --> 02:43.815
including
Callen and Sam.
Done.

02:44.860 --> 02:47.036
CALLEN:
Nell, talk to me.

02:47.079 --> 02:48.298
No one has entered
or exited backstage

02:48.342 --> 02:49.691
since the bomb went off.

02:49.734 --> 02:50.735
Got it.

02:52.563 --> 02:55.392
Hold on.
I think I hear something.

02:57.089 --> 02:59.353
Federal agent!

02:59.396 --> 03:00.919
EDDIE:
Hello? Hello?

03:00.963 --> 03:03.052
Help us! Please!

03:04.271 --> 03:06.882
Hey.

03:06.925 --> 03:08.275
How you doing there?

03:08.318 --> 03:11.016
I'm okay.
I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

03:11.060 --> 03:13.541
My name's Callen.
Can you tell me your name?

03:13.584 --> 03:14.629
I'm Eddie.You're Eddie?

03:14.672 --> 03:16.457
How old are you, Eddie?

03:16.500 --> 03:19.111
Nine.You're nine, huh?

03:19.155 --> 03:21.636
Eddie, you got anybody
in there with you?My brother Elias.

03:21.679 --> 03:22.811
I can't wake him up, though.

03:22.854 --> 03:24.552
Just help us,
please!
Okay.

03:24.595 --> 03:26.554
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

03:26.597 --> 03:28.904
I'm gonna get you out of there.
Just wait one second, okay?

03:28.947 --> 03:30.210
You just hold tight.

03:30.253 --> 03:32.734
Sam, bomb site's clear,
but I got a couple kids

03:32.777 --> 03:33.822
trapped under some debris.

03:33.865 --> 03:35.302
You need me to come to you?

03:35.345 --> 03:37.217
No, I'm good.
Stay out there with the wounded.

03:37.260 --> 03:38.348
Copy that.

03:38.392 --> 03:39.219
Sam.

03:39.262 --> 03:41.743
Baby, what's wrong?

03:41.786 --> 03:43.614
I can't breathe.

03:43.658 --> 03:44.572
Listen-- stand back.

03:44.615 --> 03:46.748
Don't move.

03:46.791 --> 03:48.619
Dan...

03:48.663 --> 03:51.013
your left collarbone
is dislocated.

03:51.056 --> 03:53.058
It's blocking
your windpipe.

03:53.102 --> 03:54.321
Oh, my God.
Will he be okay?

03:54.364 --> 03:56.497
He will be
if I can pull it in place.

03:56.540 --> 03:57.846
All right.

03:58.977 --> 04:01.893
Okay, now, Dan,

04:01.937 --> 04:03.939
we've come this far together,

04:03.982 --> 04:05.810
I'm not gonna start
lying to you now.

04:05.854 --> 04:08.160
This is gonna hurt.

04:09.336 --> 04:10.685
But it's the only way.

04:10.728 --> 04:13.035
Okay?

04:13.078 --> 04:15.646
Okay. Okay.

04:24.612 --> 04:27.136
Okay, one more, one more.

04:27.179 --> 04:28.006
Okay.

04:29.094 --> 04:30.139
Hang in there.

04:31.401 --> 04:32.794
Okay. Give me the shirt.
Give me your shirt.

04:32.837 --> 04:34.012
Get it in place.

04:34.056 --> 04:35.187
Hold that in place.
Hold that in place.

04:35.231 --> 04:36.319
Okay.

04:36.363 --> 04:38.321
Okay.

04:41.193 --> 04:42.238
Ready?

04:56.470 --> 04:58.820
ANNIE:
Thank you! Thank you so much!

04:58.863 --> 05:00.517
Thank you!We need to prep
him to move.

05:00.561 --> 05:03.215
We got to get him
to the hospital. Morales!

05:03.259 --> 05:04.391
Yes?

05:04.434 --> 05:06.567
A little help.
Oh, yes, sir.

05:10.527 --> 05:12.921
We're gonna use this
as a backboard.
Okay.

05:12.964 --> 05:14.270
All right?
Uh-huh.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.490
Okay, grab his feet.
Grab his feet.
All right.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.100
We'll lift on the count
of three.

05:18.143 --> 05:19.710
Okay? All right.Got it.

05:19.754 --> 05:22.452
One, two, three, come on.

05:24.236 --> 05:26.151
Okay, Eddie,

05:26.195 --> 05:27.631
you know how to do
an army crawl?

05:27.675 --> 05:31.026
Yeah. We do it
at gymnastics class.

05:31.069 --> 05:32.593
Well, that's good to hear.

05:32.636 --> 05:34.377
'Cause I need a little room in
there to get your brother out,

05:34.421 --> 05:36.336
and this is what
I need you to do.

05:36.379 --> 05:39.382
I want you to get down
and army crawl towards me. Okay?

05:39.426 --> 05:42.472
You think you can do that?Yeah.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.213
Let's give that a try,
all right?

05:44.256 --> 05:46.258
You just look right at me,
and let's give it a try.

05:46.302 --> 05:49.697
I can do it, but you're gonna
help Elias, right?

05:49.740 --> 05:51.046
Of course I'm gonna help Elias.

05:51.089 --> 05:52.308
But I need you to help me first.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.657
Okay?
Okay.

05:53.701 --> 05:56.399
So come on down here.
Right through here.

05:56.443 --> 05:57.705
There you go.

05:57.748 --> 06:00.316
You're a brave guy.
A brave nine-year-old.

06:02.231 --> 06:04.538
There you go.

06:04.581 --> 06:08.019
Just keep coming.
All the way.

06:08.063 --> 06:09.020
There you go, buddy.

06:09.064 --> 06:10.370
Watch your head.

06:10.413 --> 06:11.936
There you go.

06:11.980 --> 06:13.373
All right, listen, Eddie.

06:13.416 --> 06:15.766
You're gonna stay
right here, okay?

06:15.810 --> 06:17.202
I'm gonna get your brother.

06:25.254 --> 06:27.517
Kensi, Deeks,

06:27.561 --> 06:28.562
you guys out front?Excuse me.

06:28.605 --> 06:30.433
Yeah, we're here,
Sam, we're here.

06:30.477 --> 06:33.784
When Callen and I moved in
on Jalal, he looked scared.

06:33.828 --> 06:36.134
Well, makes sense. He knew
what he came here to do.

06:36.178 --> 06:38.267
No, that's the thing.
Right before the bomb detonated,

06:38.310 --> 06:39.964
he looked like...

06:40.008 --> 06:41.705
Like what?

06:41.749 --> 06:44.621
Like he wanted our help.

06:44.665 --> 06:47.232
You think somebody else
forced him to do it?

06:47.276 --> 06:49.409
I don't know,
but in that moment,

06:49.452 --> 06:51.802
I don't think he made the
decision to detonate that bomb.

06:51.846 --> 06:53.413
Someone else did.

06:53.456 --> 06:55.153
A remote detonator.
Yeah.

06:55.197 --> 06:56.764
They'd need a line of sight.

06:56.807 --> 07:00.071
They wouldn't want to be
in the theater.

07:00.115 --> 07:02.813
They had to be posted up
out front somewhere.

07:02.857 --> 07:04.380
There.

07:05.729 --> 07:06.817
Beale, I need
surveillance footage

07:06.861 --> 07:08.166
from that cafÃ©'s
outdoor seating.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.038
ERIC:
Got it. What am I looking for?

07:10.081 --> 07:11.256
Anything after
the initial explosion.

07:11.300 --> 07:12.649
Anybody acting suspicious.

07:12.693 --> 07:15.870
Ooh, there.
Push in on that guy.

07:15.913 --> 07:17.480
Yeah.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.656
NELL:
See, he's too casual.

07:19.700 --> 07:22.616
It's like he knew
what was about to happen.

07:22.659 --> 07:25.009
Okay, guys, we have a man who
was seated at the outdoor tables

07:25.053 --> 07:27.185
who casually walks away

07:27.229 --> 07:28.970
directly after the explosion.

07:29.013 --> 07:31.059
Can't get a good look
at his face, though.

07:36.717 --> 07:39.023
Sam, we've got a direct line
of sight into the lobby.

07:39.067 --> 07:41.983
Jalal didn't detonate that bomb.

08:11.186 --> 08:14.450
How you doing, Elias?
My name's Callen.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.365
I'm gonna get you out
of here. Okay?

08:16.408 --> 08:18.759
Where is Eddie?
Is he okay?

08:18.802 --> 08:22.110
Eddie's fine. He's fine.
He's right out here, okay?

08:22.153 --> 08:25.287
My mom's gonna kill me
if anything happens to him.

08:25.330 --> 08:26.810
Nothing's gonna happen
to him. Okay?

08:29.596 --> 08:31.162
I'm gonna get you out of here.

08:32.207 --> 08:34.035
All right, now, listen.

08:34.078 --> 08:37.125
I'm gonna have to lift this up
so I can get your leg free.

08:37.168 --> 08:40.041
Then I'm gonna pull you
out of here. Understand?

08:40.084 --> 08:42.609
It's gonna hurt. Right?

08:42.652 --> 08:44.219
It might.

08:44.262 --> 08:46.177
But you're Eddie's big brother.

08:46.221 --> 08:47.918
Eddie's scared right now.

08:47.962 --> 08:50.660
You've got to be
brave for him.

08:50.704 --> 08:53.576
So you're gonna be strong
for your brother, aren't you?

08:53.620 --> 08:55.186
Yes, sir.

08:55.230 --> 08:56.579
That's right.

08:56.623 --> 08:57.580
Okay, you ready?

08:57.624 --> 08:59.321
Yes, sir.

09:07.503 --> 09:09.461
There you go.
There you go.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.726
I'm gonna pull you around.

09:14.336 --> 09:16.164
You okay?Yeah.

09:16.207 --> 09:17.469
Here you go.

09:17.513 --> 09:18.993
Watch it, be careful.

09:19.036 --> 09:20.603
All right.
All right.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.605
You are being so brave,
my friend.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.393
You still there, Eddie?EDDIE:
Yeah.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.887
There you go.

09:43.931 --> 09:45.759
Elias.I'm okay.

09:45.802 --> 09:48.065
I'm okay.I got both boys.

09:48.109 --> 09:49.589
NELL:
Nice work, Callen.

09:49.632 --> 09:52.809
Bomb squad has secured
exit points west of the lobby.

09:52.853 --> 09:54.115
Copy that.

09:56.030 --> 09:58.946
Mrs. Ryland.Cathy!

10:02.950 --> 10:04.734
Guys, we got to go.
Got to move,

10:04.778 --> 10:06.170
got to move, got to move...SAM: All right,
Dan, hang in there.

10:06.214 --> 10:07.476
Hang in there.
We got you.

10:07.519 --> 10:10.131
Come on, come on,
come on. Right here.

10:10.174 --> 10:13.264
Okay. All right.
You hang in there, buddy.

10:13.308 --> 10:16.616
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you.You're welcome. You're welcome.

10:16.659 --> 10:17.617
Be strong.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.357
Hey, Morales.

10:19.401 --> 10:21.229
Good work in there today.

10:21.272 --> 10:23.231
Why would someone do this?

10:23.274 --> 10:25.842
I ask myself that every day.

10:25.886 --> 10:28.758
Excuse me.
Hey, guys.

10:28.802 --> 10:29.759
Here we go.

10:29.803 --> 10:32.196
Watch his leg.Elias.

10:50.998 --> 10:52.390
NEWSMAN:
Yes, Paula, as you can see,

10:52.434 --> 10:54.479
this is the terrifying scene
just outside...

10:54.523 --> 10:56.960
Body count's up to seven,
but all other civilians

10:57.004 --> 10:59.049
were safely evac'd.

10:59.093 --> 11:00.703
Bomb squad's gonna be
finishing clearing the theater

11:00.747 --> 11:02.313
in the next few hours.

11:02.357 --> 11:03.706
Look, I know
you're all running on fumes,

11:03.750 --> 11:05.055
but you saw this video.

11:05.099 --> 11:07.231
The terrorist cell we
believe is responsible,

11:07.275 --> 11:09.712
the Mashriq Army,
has issued another threat.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.583
And based on the weapons crates
we found at the warehouse,

11:11.627 --> 11:12.933
it could be a bombing

11:12.976 --> 11:14.543
or an active shooter scenario.SAM:
If these attacks

11:14.586 --> 11:15.936
were financed by money

11:15.979 --> 11:17.720
that Jalal stole
from Omar Azim...

11:17.764 --> 11:19.156
Then we need to find Azim.Right.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.331
Eric and Nell found a
last known location,

11:20.375 --> 11:22.116
an intersection in West L.A.

11:22.159 --> 11:23.639
We'll check it out.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.510
Wasim Ghulam, the suspect

11:25.554 --> 11:27.774
in the USS Iowaattack,
has just regained consciousness.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.514
So I'd like you

11:29.558 --> 11:30.733
to take Fatima with you.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.169
See if you can get
anything out of him.

11:37.261 --> 11:39.220
Anything on that video, Beale?

11:39.263 --> 11:40.612
No, and I'm trying

11:40.656 --> 11:42.179
everything I can think of.

11:43.180 --> 11:45.574
Well, breaks come
when you least expect them.

11:45.617 --> 11:47.881
The FBI found

11:47.924 --> 11:50.231
four undetonated bombs hidden
within the theater,

11:50.274 --> 11:51.667
so as awful as
the attack was,

11:51.711 --> 11:53.887
it could've been much worse.

11:53.930 --> 11:55.845
Okay.

11:55.889 --> 11:57.368
I just got a hit on the search
for known associates

11:57.412 --> 11:59.762
of Lethabo Khan, the shooter

11:59.806 --> 12:01.982
Callen and Sam took down
at the warehouse.

12:02.025 --> 12:03.592
Okay, apparently this photo

12:03.635 --> 12:05.507
was taken in Panama
six months ago.

12:05.550 --> 12:07.465
Now, that is Khan on the left,

12:07.509 --> 12:11.339
and facial rec just ID'd the man
on the right as Moswen Basson.

12:11.382 --> 12:12.862
Interesting.

12:12.906 --> 12:15.169
Basson served in the same
Special Forces unit as Khan,

12:15.212 --> 12:16.779
and, like Khan,

12:16.823 --> 12:19.477
he was discharged in 2009
for insubordination.

12:19.521 --> 12:21.088
Discharged
for the same incident?

12:21.131 --> 12:22.480
Well, it appears so,

12:22.524 --> 12:24.961
but the details
have been redacted.

12:25.005 --> 12:27.007
Intel records show Khan working
for a private security firm

12:27.050 --> 12:30.184
in Venezuela from 2010 to 2013.NELL:
Ooh.

12:30.227 --> 12:32.752
And lookee here.
FBI flagged Basson

12:32.795 --> 12:35.363
as part
of a private protection detail

12:35.406 --> 12:36.973
in Costa Rica at that same time.

12:37.017 --> 12:39.497
Looks like both men chose
to go the paid mercenary route.

12:39.541 --> 12:40.977
What are the odds
that they've kept in touch?

12:41.021 --> 12:44.154
Maybe Basson is also working
for the Mashriq Army.

12:44.198 --> 12:45.765
NELL:
Well, according to
Fatima, Mashriq Army

12:45.808 --> 12:47.331
doesn't work with outsiders.

12:47.375 --> 12:49.159
Well, based on the events
of the last few days,

12:49.203 --> 12:51.292
the Mashriq Army's evolving.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.780
Tell you, those kids from the
theater are something special.

13:00.823 --> 13:02.607
I don't know many adults
who could've held it together

13:02.651 --> 13:04.566
in a situation like that.

13:04.609 --> 13:06.263
They got that warrior spirit.

13:06.307 --> 13:07.743
Yeah.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.223
You hear from the hospital?

13:10.224 --> 13:11.399
Elias is still in surgery.

13:12.748 --> 13:14.663
Doctor said
it's gonna be a long one.

13:15.707 --> 13:17.492
We'll find the people
who did this.

13:17.535 --> 13:18.841
NELL:
Hey, Callen?

13:18.885 --> 13:19.842
Yeah.

13:19.886 --> 13:20.843
So, I got an update

13:20.887 --> 13:22.149
on Omar's car.

13:22.192 --> 13:23.977
After it passed
through that intersection,

13:24.020 --> 13:25.848
it looks like
a gas station security camera

13:25.892 --> 13:27.545
picked it up
about a mile down the road

13:27.589 --> 13:29.112
turning into an industrial park.

13:29.156 --> 13:30.766
Gonna send you the location now.

13:30.810 --> 13:31.854
All right, got it.

13:31.898 --> 13:34.509
Oh, and, guys,
Omar is not alone.

13:34.552 --> 13:36.816
The video shows two others
in his car.

13:37.686 --> 13:38.948
Copy that.

13:45.607 --> 13:47.478
Wasim.

13:47.522 --> 13:49.263
Nice to see you again.

13:51.526 --> 13:53.223
You help the Americans?

13:53.267 --> 13:54.877
Betray your people,

13:54.921 --> 13:57.880
your country, and
almighty Allah.

13:57.924 --> 14:00.187
You wear a hijab,

14:00.230 --> 14:03.755
but you are nothing more
than a spoiled American girl.

14:03.799 --> 14:07.759
You murder innocent people
for personal gain.

14:07.803 --> 14:10.980
Your actions have nothing to do
with Allah.

14:17.813 --> 14:19.075
Why don't you tell us why

14:19.119 --> 14:20.468
the Mashriq Army attacked
the L.A. Theatre.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.775
I will tell you nothing.

14:24.820 --> 14:26.169
Oh.

14:26.213 --> 14:27.605
Easy, tiger.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.000
Starting to think

14:31.044 --> 14:32.523
you don't like me.

14:32.567 --> 14:34.874
Which is weird, right? 'Cause
I'm incredibly likable.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.919
Super likable.
In fact, it's probably

14:36.963 --> 14:39.443
the most common adjective used
to describe me, is "likable."

14:39.487 --> 14:41.271
Maybe not the mostcommon.Stop.

14:41.315 --> 14:43.012
Just stop talking.

14:43.056 --> 14:44.187
KENSI:
It's amazing to me

14:44.231 --> 14:45.580
how in every culture
on this planet,

14:45.623 --> 14:47.364
people have the same
reaction to you.

14:47.408 --> 14:48.931
Oh, it's not Deeks. Wasim here

14:48.975 --> 14:51.629
is just a man who values
his personal space.

14:53.327 --> 14:55.024
DEEKS:
Not being fond of tight spaces

14:55.068 --> 14:57.940
is interesting, considering
your reward for trying to bomb

14:57.984 --> 15:00.638
the USS Iowa
is solitary confinement.

15:00.682 --> 15:03.032
KENSI:
23 hours a day

15:03.076 --> 15:04.991
in a six-by-eight
windowless box.

15:05.034 --> 15:06.818
At night, you know
what they say?

15:06.862 --> 15:08.908
It is so dark in there

15:08.951 --> 15:11.998
that it's like being trapped
in a black hole.

15:12.041 --> 15:15.001
Okay! I can't do
solitary confinement. Please.

15:15.044 --> 15:16.045
Back away.

15:16.872 --> 15:18.265
Okay.Okay.

15:20.876 --> 15:22.399
KENSI:
Then I'll ask again.

15:22.443 --> 15:23.748
Why did the Mashriq Army

15:23.792 --> 15:25.228
attack the L.A. Theatre?

15:25.272 --> 15:27.578
What are you talking about?There was a bombing today.

15:27.622 --> 15:29.929
The Mashriq Army
does not attack theaters.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.539
We seek to
avenge the death

15:31.582 --> 15:33.106
of our families

15:33.149 --> 15:35.412
and the destruction of our homes
by your cowardly military.

15:35.456 --> 15:37.110
Tell us about Abbas Jalal

15:37.153 --> 15:39.155
and his role within
the Mashriq Army.

15:40.417 --> 15:43.333
Jalal only manages our money.

15:43.377 --> 15:46.510
He is not a soldier
of the cause.

15:46.554 --> 15:47.685
He is of little value to us.

15:47.729 --> 15:48.860
KENSI:
Really? He's of so little value

15:48.904 --> 15:50.340
to you that you manipulated him

15:50.384 --> 15:51.602
into wearing a suicide vest

15:51.646 --> 15:52.864
at the L.A. Theatre.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.605
Jalal was a fearful man.

15:54.649 --> 15:56.912
He's not capable
of something like that.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.044
And even if he was,

15:58.087 --> 16:00.046
he would never pay
the ultimate price

16:00.089 --> 16:01.351
for the Mashriq Army.

16:01.395 --> 16:03.136
Well, he did, so tell us why.

16:05.181 --> 16:07.314
I have no idea.

16:07.357 --> 16:08.750
Who would Jalal
sacrifice himself for

16:08.793 --> 16:10.404
if not for you and your cause?

16:12.449 --> 16:15.278
This man, Omar Azim.

16:15.322 --> 16:17.628
Jalal loved him
like a father,

16:17.672 --> 16:19.761
but Omar would
not accept us.

16:19.804 --> 16:21.154
He spoke poorly

16:21.197 --> 16:22.720
of the Mashriq Army

16:22.764 --> 16:25.375
and even tried to get Jalal
to condemn us.

16:26.376 --> 16:28.509
So you forced Jalal
to steal that money

16:28.552 --> 16:30.685
from Bana and Omar Azim?

16:31.729 --> 16:34.689
Jalal proved himself loyal
to the Mashriq Army.

16:36.212 --> 16:38.562
But he did not kill himself
for us.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.480
CALLEN:
We've found
Omar's last known location.

16:43.524 --> 16:45.874
SAM:
No bombs, no wires.
We're going in.

16:45.917 --> 16:47.702
Copy that.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.831
Omar Azim.

17:29.874 --> 17:31.485
The Mashriq Army flag.

17:31.528 --> 17:33.878
SAM:
This is where they
filmed the threat video.

17:33.922 --> 17:35.619
Then, whoever issued
the threat of another attack

17:35.663 --> 17:37.621
is still out there.

17:47.588 --> 17:49.981
CALLEN:
Coroner's prelim
placed Omar's death

17:50.025 --> 17:51.461
within the last few hours.

17:51.505 --> 17:54.682
SAM: Hmm.These two were killed
over 12 hours ago.

17:54.725 --> 17:56.553
Bana Azim said Omar
disappeared last night,

17:56.597 --> 17:58.207
so he was kept tied up.

17:58.251 --> 18:00.905
Maybe they restrained Omar
so they could interrogate him.

18:00.949 --> 18:02.559
Might have had something
to do with Jalal.

18:02.603 --> 18:04.126
SAM:
And these two were
stripped down.

18:04.170 --> 18:07.434
Clothes gone, not
anywhere in the building.

18:07.477 --> 18:09.610
Maybe they were wearing
some kind of uniforms.

18:09.653 --> 18:12.830
Uniforms that give them access
to their next target.

18:12.874 --> 18:16.138
We need IDs on these bodies,
find out where they worked.

18:16.182 --> 18:18.488
FATIMA:
So let's say Jalal didn't plan

18:18.532 --> 18:19.968
or want to carry out
the bombing,

18:20.011 --> 18:21.839
and he didn't do it
for the Mashriq Army.

18:21.883 --> 18:23.189
Well, Omar's bound
and executed,

18:23.232 --> 18:25.104
so it looks like he didn't
force Jalal to do it.

18:25.147 --> 18:27.236
Unless he did.What do you mean?

18:27.280 --> 18:29.586
Jalal cared for Omar; he's
like a father figure to him.

18:29.630 --> 18:32.763
So what if somebody used Omar
as leverage against Jalal?

18:32.807 --> 18:35.201
Okay, so...

18:35.244 --> 18:37.420
Omar wasn't tortured
and interrogated.

18:37.464 --> 18:38.943
He was being used as ransom

18:38.987 --> 18:40.945
until Jalal executed
the bombing.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.251
If Jalal didn't follow through,

18:42.295 --> 18:44.558
they'd kill a man he cared for
and respected.

18:44.601 --> 18:48.170
We have to find who's pulling
these strings, and fast.

18:48.214 --> 18:49.519
NELL:
Hey, Callen?

18:49.563 --> 18:50.868
What's the word, Nell?

18:50.912 --> 18:52.435
NELL:
I've ID'd the bodies.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.220
Uh, Graham Heller
and Ray Donner,

18:54.263 --> 18:57.440
they were both baggage handlers
at the West Harbor Airport.

18:57.484 --> 18:59.138
That's their next target.

18:59.181 --> 19:00.617
Have Kensi and Deeks
meet us there,

19:00.661 --> 19:02.793
and alert the airport
PD that we're inbound.

19:02.837 --> 19:04.099
We don't want
to trigger any action

19:04.143 --> 19:06.710
earlier than they had planned.Yep, got it.

19:06.754 --> 19:11.454
Those employee ID badges give
'em access to restricted areas.

19:11.498 --> 19:13.326
That's not good.

19:17.025 --> 19:18.287
Hey, guys?

19:18.331 --> 19:19.636
CALLEN: Yeah.So, airport director

19:19.680 --> 19:21.116
said that Donner
and Heller were part

19:21.160 --> 19:23.988
of the crew that was stationed
at the main terminal.

19:24.032 --> 19:26.208
I only see six baggage handlers.

19:26.252 --> 19:28.079
No one noticed that Donner
and Heller showed up to work

19:28.123 --> 19:29.472
looking a little different?

19:29.516 --> 19:31.387
We were told the airport
uses lots of contractors,

19:31.431 --> 19:32.867
so there's lots of turnover.

19:32.910 --> 19:34.999
Yeah. Crews are accustomed
to seeing new faces every day.

19:35.043 --> 19:37.045
All right, we'll head in,
we'll find out who's using

19:37.088 --> 19:39.134
the stolen ID badges.And, Deeks,

19:39.178 --> 19:40.831
tell the director of the airport
that we'll be on the tarmac

19:40.875 --> 19:43.399
wearing mechanics coveralls
and vests.

19:43.443 --> 19:45.836
That'll be cute. Copy that.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.490
Follow my lead out there.

19:47.534 --> 19:49.623
I know tools
aren't your thing.

19:49.666 --> 19:51.190
Useful tools are my thing.

19:51.233 --> 19:52.843
Mm.You know, guns, knives,
things that'll save my life.

19:52.887 --> 19:55.194
That stuff you use for your
hobbies, like fixing old boats

19:55.237 --> 19:57.326
and cars, those aren't tools,
those are toys.

19:57.370 --> 19:58.675
And it doesn't
bother you,

19:58.719 --> 20:00.286
knowing that if your
car breaks down,

20:00.329 --> 20:02.462
you have neither the knowledge
nor tools to fix it?

20:02.505 --> 20:04.812
Now, in this scenario,
is every auto mechanic

20:04.855 --> 20:06.988
in the entire world
already dead?

20:08.337 --> 20:10.339
I'm just asking.

20:11.862 --> 20:12.820
WOMAN:
Bye now, thank you.

20:12.863 --> 20:15.301
MAN:
Thanks.Have a nice day.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.264
Half the badges are obscured,

20:22.308 --> 20:23.613
but I'm sending you
the photos anyway.

20:23.657 --> 20:25.659
NELL:
Copy that, Callen.

20:29.402 --> 20:31.317
What exactly are you pretending
to do over there?

20:32.492 --> 20:33.580
I mean, it's ridiculous.

20:33.623 --> 20:35.234
Why does it bother you so much

20:35.277 --> 20:37.236
that we don't have the same
interests and hobbies?

20:37.279 --> 20:38.672
'Cause I don't want to get shot
because you're over there

20:38.715 --> 20:39.890
tapping things with a wrench.

20:39.934 --> 20:41.370
That's a good point.

20:41.414 --> 20:43.067
NELL:
Hey, Callen, I've got a match.

20:43.111 --> 20:44.634
South African mercenary
Moswen Basson,

20:44.678 --> 20:45.940
he's the guy with the beard.

20:45.983 --> 20:47.637
FATIMA:
We got a hit
on Homeland's database.

20:47.681 --> 20:49.465
The last photo you sent
is another

20:49.509 --> 20:51.728
South African mercenary
named Sanele Chetty.

20:51.772 --> 20:54.078
He has ties with Basson
going back a decade,

20:54.122 --> 20:55.558
when they were both arrested
for smuggling

20:55.602 --> 20:57.604
military-grade explosives
into South Africa.

20:57.647 --> 21:00.128
That's three South African
mercenaries since the warehouse.

21:00.171 --> 21:02.652
Mm-hmm.The Mashriq Army

21:02.696 --> 21:04.132
would never work
with mercenaries.

21:04.175 --> 21:05.394
CALLEN:
Yeah, well, either way,
we got two shooters

21:05.438 --> 21:07.396
on site that are
explosive experts.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.746
Everyone's hustling from cart
to cart but Basson and Chetty.

21:09.790 --> 21:12.271
They're staying
at the same cart.

21:12.314 --> 21:14.011
Well, let's find out
what's on the cart.

21:14.055 --> 21:16.144
Kens, Deeks, we're moving in.

21:16.187 --> 21:18.277
Heads on a swivel. We don't know
if they got backup shooters

21:18.320 --> 21:20.279
on site.Copy that.

21:21.802 --> 21:23.847
Hey, guys.

21:25.066 --> 21:27.024
Is this the baggage cart
with the bad axle?

21:27.068 --> 21:29.288
There is no problem here.

21:29.331 --> 21:30.419
SAM:
Look, guys,

21:30.463 --> 21:31.942
the sooner you point out
the broken axle,

21:31.986 --> 21:34.467
the sooner I can get back
to the bar to watch the fight.

21:34.510 --> 21:36.686
There is no problem.Look, I've been waiting

21:36.730 --> 21:39.341
a long time for the heavyweight
division to make a comeback,

21:39.385 --> 21:40.603
so if you just point out

21:40.647 --> 21:42.039
the broken axle,
we can all be on our way.

21:42.083 --> 21:45.129
Please, we are
very busy here.

21:45.173 --> 21:46.305
Federal agents!

21:47.001 --> 21:49.220
SAM:
On your knees. On your knees.

21:49.264 --> 21:50.961
Don't do it. Don't do it.

21:55.836 --> 21:57.707
I got Chetty.I got the bag.

22:16.073 --> 22:18.424
Nell, we have an unactivated
bomb on the tarmac.

22:18.467 --> 22:19.773
Alert Airport Police.

22:19.816 --> 22:21.383
I'm looking for any antennas.

22:21.427 --> 22:22.732
Copy that, Sam.

22:22.776 --> 22:24.560
Attention. This is
the NCIS Operation Center.

22:24.604 --> 22:27.607
I need you to clear all runways
and terminals immediately.

22:27.650 --> 22:29.652
There is a live explosive
on site.

22:29.696 --> 22:32.307
I repeat:
a live explosive on site.

22:43.231 --> 22:44.754
Sam. Chetty's secured,

22:44.798 --> 22:47.278
but I think he may
have activated the bomb.

22:47.322 --> 22:48.671
He did.

22:48.715 --> 22:50.412
But I think I can disarm this.

22:50.456 --> 22:52.675
WOMAN :
Attention, travelers,
please immediately

22:52.719 --> 22:54.024
proceed to the main terminal

22:54.068 --> 22:56.026
and exit
through the entrance doors,

22:56.070 --> 22:58.725
toward Parking Lot A.

22:58.768 --> 23:00.379
Deeks, janitor has a gun.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.642
Airport security will be waiting
to provide further instructions.

23:02.685 --> 23:03.860
Federal agents.

23:03.904 --> 23:06.559
Remain calm and orderly
at all times.

23:06.602 --> 23:07.516
We appreciate your cooperation.

23:07.560 --> 23:08.909
DEEKS:
Now!
Drop!

23:08.952 --> 23:10.693
DEEKS:
Hey!

23:10.737 --> 23:11.999
KENSI:
Secure the weapon!

23:19.833 --> 23:20.877
Oh!

23:22.879 --> 23:23.880
You know I had him, right?

23:23.924 --> 23:26.753
Yeah, clearly. You okay?

23:26.796 --> 23:28.363
Yeah, just kind of tweaked
my neck on that hit.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.712
That's 'cause you got to pop
from the hips,

23:29.756 --> 23:30.713
flatten your back,
keep your head up,

23:30.757 --> 23:32.367
and drive through your target.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.108
Yeah, I'll think
about that next time.

23:34.151 --> 23:35.588
Callen, Sam, I got the guy
in the terminal.

23:35.631 --> 23:36.937
CALLEN:
Everybody needs to move!

23:36.980 --> 23:39.287
There's a live bomb
on the tarmac!

23:39.330 --> 23:40.462
Partner, how we doing?

23:40.506 --> 23:42.159
40 seconds. I'm almost there.

23:42.203 --> 23:44.118
I just need a few more seconds.

23:44.161 --> 23:45.902
Sam, we've just learned
that there are 11 people

23:45.946 --> 23:47.643
still on that plane.

23:50.037 --> 23:51.778
Nell, how's that west runway
looking?

23:51.821 --> 23:53.562
NELL:
Air traffic has been diverted.

23:53.606 --> 23:55.434
Ground personnel is clear.
You are good to go.

24:09.273 --> 24:11.450
Sam, you're cutting it
too close.

24:11.493 --> 24:13.234
The blast can ignite
the jet fuel.

24:13.277 --> 24:15.454
I need to get more separation.

24:15.497 --> 24:16.716
Sam, you need to get off
of that thing, now!

24:16.759 --> 24:19.196
I've got five seconds! Four...

24:19.240 --> 24:20.633
Sam, get off!

24:20.676 --> 24:21.764
Three...Sam.

24:22.765 --> 24:23.592
Sam!

24:29.380 --> 24:30.773
KENSI:
Oh, my gosh.

24:59.280 --> 25:01.282
CALLEN:
All right, thanks.

25:04.111 --> 25:05.939
You good?

25:07.288 --> 25:09.290
Be better if I didn't see
a bomb for a long time.

25:09.333 --> 25:10.900
What do you mean?
Bombs are your thing.

25:10.944 --> 25:12.772
It's like your superpower.

25:12.815 --> 25:14.556
I mean, Sam Hanna
without a bomb to disable

25:14.600 --> 25:16.993
would kind of be
like Aquaman without a...

25:18.952 --> 25:22.259
No. Based on your vast,
extensive knowledge of comics,

25:22.303 --> 25:23.957
I'm looking forward
to hearting this.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.393
Aquaman without what?

25:25.436 --> 25:28.744
Aquaman without a...
I got nothing.

25:28.788 --> 25:30.703
I got nothing.

25:30.746 --> 25:33.357
I don't think
the Mashriq Army's behind this.

25:33.401 --> 25:35.098
I think those
South African mercenaries

25:35.142 --> 25:37.318
are working
for someone else.

25:37.361 --> 25:39.407
Neither attack matches
the intel Fatima gave us

25:39.450 --> 25:41.017
on the Mashriq Army.

25:41.061 --> 25:44.107
They don't target civilians
and they don't use outsiders.

25:44.151 --> 25:46.457
Right, so whoever's behind this
showed us that fake video

25:46.501 --> 25:48.155
to keep us on the trail
of the Mashriq Army.

25:48.198 --> 25:49.722
I don't think
it's another terrorist group.

25:49.765 --> 25:51.724
They usually want to
take credit for these attacks.

25:51.767 --> 25:53.334
You know, a terrorist
group wouldn't target

25:53.377 --> 25:54.857
an airport this small.

25:54.901 --> 25:57.468
Or a movie theater
midweek at noon.

25:57.512 --> 25:59.035
They want high-density,
soft targets

25:59.079 --> 26:01.255
where they can get
as many kills as possible.

26:01.298 --> 26:04.650
Yeah. LAX,
The Grove, you know.

26:04.693 --> 26:06.434
More casualties,
more publicity.

26:06.477 --> 26:07.957
Well, unless
they're not prepared

26:08.001 --> 26:09.480
for all the additional security.

26:09.524 --> 26:11.439
Nah, these guys are
pros, ex-military.

26:11.482 --> 26:13.789
They're not gonna be deterred
by private security.

26:13.833 --> 26:15.878
All right, so these attacks
aren't causing mass casualties,

26:15.922 --> 26:17.924
but they are causing
mass hysteria.

26:17.967 --> 26:19.969
Why would you want to set
that atmosphere?

26:20.013 --> 26:24.017
Everyone in the city of L.A.
is in a state of panic.

26:24.060 --> 26:27.629
They're wondering where
the next attack will be.

26:27.673 --> 26:29.631
These attacks are a smokescreen
for something else.

26:29.675 --> 26:33.113
Something more important that
would warrant all this effort.

26:33.156 --> 26:35.158
Important's another way
of saying valuable.

26:35.202 --> 26:37.291
Could be a high-level heist.It would have to be

26:37.334 --> 26:40.511
the heist of the century
to justify all this.

26:42.688 --> 26:44.603
If these guys weren't
dying for a cause,

26:44.646 --> 26:46.996
then they were looking to leave.

26:47.040 --> 26:48.519
Looking to escape alive.

26:48.563 --> 26:52.001
Eric, Nell, these guys
probably had an escape vehicle

26:52.045 --> 26:53.481
here at the airport;
see if you can locate it.

26:53.524 --> 26:55.309
And alert LAPD
to be on the lookout

26:55.352 --> 26:56.832
for potential hits
on large banks,

26:56.876 --> 26:58.617
jewelry stores, museums.

26:58.660 --> 27:00.227
ERIC:
We're on it.

27:01.924 --> 27:05.536
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

27:05.580 --> 27:08.191
but your threats...

27:08.235 --> 27:09.932
they have no value to me.

27:09.976 --> 27:12.674
They're not threats.
They're promises.

27:12.718 --> 27:14.720
You will spend the next...

27:14.763 --> 27:17.200
forever in prison.

27:18.593 --> 27:23.206
I do not fear the punishment
that awaits me.

27:23.250 --> 27:24.947
This is kind of a first.

27:24.991 --> 27:27.689
Someone just completely
brushing off a life sentence.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.386
Well, there's a way in,
we just got to find it.

27:29.430 --> 27:31.388
Tell me more
about this Dingane Naidoo.

27:31.432 --> 27:34.217
Well, like his fellow cohorts
from the airport,

27:34.261 --> 27:35.697
he is a native of South Africa.

27:35.741 --> 27:36.698
Did he serve?

27:36.742 --> 27:38.787
Military, no.
Time, yes.

27:38.831 --> 27:41.616
Though his record is
largely unimpressive.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.226
He's got a minor drug arrest

27:43.270 --> 27:45.751
in South Africa,
a burglary charge

27:45.794 --> 27:47.709
in Saudi Arabia
that he got off on.

27:47.753 --> 27:49.711
It doesn't sound like the
profile of a religious zealot.

27:49.755 --> 27:51.104
FATIMA:
Not at all.

27:51.147 --> 27:52.627
And it definitely doesn't fit
with what we know

27:52.671 --> 27:53.889
about the Mashriq Army.

27:53.933 --> 27:55.935
Yeah, sounds more like
a common street criminal

27:55.978 --> 27:57.763
looking for their next gig.

27:57.806 --> 27:59.808
Well, maybe that's
all he is.
What do you mean?

27:59.852 --> 28:02.724
Well, maybe this was
his next gig.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.421
Working with a crew
of mercenaries

28:04.465 --> 28:07.163
to bomb the West Harbor Airport
as cover for something else?

28:07.207 --> 28:08.164
He wouldn't come
all this way to work

28:08.208 --> 28:09.818
without a hefty payday.

28:09.862 --> 28:10.906
Well, and if he's willing
to spend the rest

28:10.950 --> 28:12.125
of his life behind bars,

28:12.168 --> 28:14.344
it must be because
he already got paid.

28:14.388 --> 28:16.738
Yeah, but you can't spend
that money in prison.

28:16.782 --> 28:19.001
Which means it's
for somebody else.

28:19.045 --> 28:21.438
Huh.

28:21.482 --> 28:23.702
Callen, Sam,
I got Basson and Chetty

28:23.745 --> 28:25.747
pulling into the main terminal
parking lot this morning.

28:25.791 --> 28:28.097
Got it.
What were they driving?

28:28.141 --> 28:30.578
ERIC:
It's a gray van.

28:30.621 --> 28:32.623
That van could be wired.

28:32.667 --> 28:34.974
You're the bomb guy.

28:35.017 --> 28:36.802
So, it looks like
your theory holds water.

28:36.845 --> 28:39.239
Naidoo does have someone
back in South Africa.

28:39.282 --> 28:41.067
Who? Wife? Parents?

28:41.110 --> 28:43.156
No, his parents died years ago,
and he never married, but...

28:43.199 --> 28:46.159
FATIMA:
He once lived
with a woman in Johannesburg,

28:46.202 --> 28:48.422
who now lives there
with her five-year-old son.

28:48.465 --> 28:49.989
So, let me guess.
They shared that apartment

28:50.032 --> 28:51.599
in 2013?

28:51.642 --> 28:54.036
Yep. And it looks like
this boy is Naidoo's son.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.256
Oh, and get this. The boy
attends a private school

28:56.299 --> 28:59.302
that costs the equivalent
of $15,000 a year,

28:59.346 --> 29:01.740
and his mother works
as a waitress.

29:01.783 --> 29:03.785
Yeah, she's not paying
that tuition on her own.

29:03.829 --> 29:05.352
Okay, so the money
he's making as a mercenary

29:05.395 --> 29:06.919
is used for his child,
which is why

29:06.962 --> 29:08.094
he doesn't mind going to prison.

29:08.137 --> 29:09.225
And we've found our way in.

29:09.269 --> 29:10.226
Yep.
Shall we?

29:10.270 --> 29:11.488
Yeah.

29:12.968 --> 29:14.404
Oh, Agent Ross.

29:14.448 --> 29:15.884
Detective Deeks, Agent Blye,

29:15.928 --> 29:18.104
I understand that
you detained Dingane Naidoo

29:18.147 --> 29:19.366
at the West Harbor Airport.

29:19.409 --> 29:20.584
We're about to go
and question him again.

29:20.628 --> 29:21.890
You want to join us?

29:21.934 --> 29:23.892
I'm afraid
that's gonna have to wait.

29:23.936 --> 29:25.764
I need to take Naidoo with me.

29:25.807 --> 29:26.982
No, no, no. I know
that we're working this

29:27.026 --> 29:28.288
through the Joint
Terrorism Task Force,

29:28.331 --> 29:30.638
but Naidoo is accused
of planning and executing

29:30.681 --> 29:31.639
a terrorist attack.

29:31.682 --> 29:33.162
Now, we got him.
He has information

29:33.206 --> 29:34.816
that could help prevent
the next attack.

29:34.860 --> 29:37.819
Look, if it were up to me,
I wouldn't be here, all right.

29:37.863 --> 29:39.038
But I have my hands tied.

29:39.081 --> 29:40.648
I mean, this came
straight from the top.

29:40.691 --> 29:42.432
I've got personnel
coming in on a plane.

29:42.476 --> 29:43.912
Washington feels that
their interrogators

29:43.956 --> 29:45.131
are just gonna be
more effective.

29:45.174 --> 29:47.350
I'm sorry.
Let's go.

29:50.876 --> 29:52.529
Did that just happen?

29:52.573 --> 29:55.097
Yeah.
That just happened.

29:55.141 --> 29:57.447
No wires, no explosives.

29:57.491 --> 29:58.753
Looks empty.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.363
Yeah.

30:10.330 --> 30:12.506
Careful.

30:14.029 --> 30:15.857
SAM:
What you got?

30:15.901 --> 30:18.991
I got passports with the photos
of Khan, Naidoo,

30:19.034 --> 30:20.122
Basson, and Chetty.

30:20.166 --> 30:22.298
False names.

30:24.779 --> 30:26.346
They were planning
on exiting the country

30:26.389 --> 30:27.869
once this thing was over.

30:27.913 --> 30:32.569
Fatima, has LAPD confirmed
any threats against local banks

30:32.613 --> 30:33.962
or other high-value targets?

30:34.006 --> 30:34.963
FATIMA:
Negative, Callen.

30:35.007 --> 30:36.269
LAPD is still on alert,

30:36.312 --> 30:38.010
but they haven't noticed
anything suspicious.

30:38.053 --> 30:40.882
Oh, and, guys, the FBI
took Naidoo from the boatshed.

30:40.926 --> 30:43.972
They are taking over
his interrogation.

30:44.016 --> 30:46.192
I mean, I fully recognize that
we're all on the same team here,

30:46.235 --> 30:48.150
but it's just...
It sucks.

30:48.194 --> 30:49.891
We gave the FBI Naidoo's son,

30:49.935 --> 30:51.719
and now we're risking
another bomb going off

30:51.762 --> 30:54.896
while they test this airborne
interrogation team of theirs.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.593
Did you say "airborne"?

30:58.247 --> 30:59.814
Yeah. Why?
What are you thinking?

30:59.858 --> 31:01.468
Sam and Callen found
fake passports,

31:01.511 --> 31:04.210
which means that Khan,
Naidoo, Chetty, and Basson

31:04.253 --> 31:05.689
were all planning
on leaving the country.

31:05.733 --> 31:07.474
Except nobody is airborne

31:07.517 --> 31:08.736
because all the airports
are closed.

31:08.779 --> 31:09.911
I mean, nobody's
landing or taking off.

31:09.955 --> 31:12.958
But what about
a private flight?

31:13.001 --> 31:14.785
Nell, you got any private
flights scheduled to take off

31:14.829 --> 31:17.136
from airports other than LAX
or West Harbor?

31:17.179 --> 31:19.399
No, nothing.
And the flights

31:19.442 --> 31:21.531
that were scheduled
to arrive at LAX and West Harbor

31:21.575 --> 31:23.446
have been rerouted
to a regional airport.

31:23.490 --> 31:25.709
They've all landed except for
one, a noncommercial flight

31:25.753 --> 31:27.537
from Bangkok
with only four passengers.

31:27.581 --> 31:29.278
But hold on.

31:29.322 --> 31:30.932
Guys, this flight
is transporting

31:30.976 --> 31:32.020
a prisoner for extradition.

31:32.064 --> 31:33.369
He's a South African
arms dealer.

31:33.413 --> 31:35.154
Jandre Els.

31:35.197 --> 31:37.939
Jandre Els is extremely
high-level

31:37.983 --> 31:39.245
and extremely well-funded.

31:39.288 --> 31:41.377
And he's about to spend
a lot of time in prison,

31:41.421 --> 31:43.162
which means he has the incentive
to find somebody

31:43.205 --> 31:44.293
willing to help him escape.

31:44.337 --> 31:45.773
Or, better yet,
a group of somebodies.

31:45.816 --> 31:48.254
Say, for instance,
South African mercenaries.

31:48.297 --> 31:50.125
My money says they're
all working for him.

31:50.169 --> 31:52.258
This was never about
a high-value heist.

31:52.301 --> 31:53.781
Jandre Els is the target.

31:53.824 --> 31:55.087
NELL:
Okay, guys,

31:55.130 --> 31:56.958
U.S. Marshals were planning
on transferring Els

31:57.002 --> 31:59.613
directly to a flight to Chicago,
where he's being tried.

31:59.656 --> 32:02.616
But they're now moving him
to the Metro Detention Center

32:02.659 --> 32:04.270
until flights are restored.

32:04.313 --> 32:05.967
That's why they wanted
those flights grounded,

32:06.011 --> 32:07.795
so that Els' connecting flight
wouldn't take off.

32:07.838 --> 32:09.797
I mean, think about it.
He's much more vulnerable

32:09.840 --> 32:11.625
en route
to the Metro Detention Center

32:11.668 --> 32:13.061
'cause
it's an impromptu transfer.

32:13.105 --> 32:14.933
Yeah, but Khan, Basson,
and Chetty are all dead,

32:14.976 --> 32:16.978
and Naidoo is on his way
to Washington.Yeah, but

32:17.022 --> 32:18.806
we never found those automatic
rifles from the warehouse.

32:18.849 --> 32:20.068
There could be
a whole second team

32:20.112 --> 32:21.287
out there just waiting

32:21.330 --> 32:22.462
to take down
this prison transport.

32:22.505 --> 32:23.811
Guys, the Jandre Els flight

32:23.854 --> 32:25.465
has landed at Torrance Airport,

32:25.508 --> 32:27.467
and an SUV registered
to the marshals

32:27.510 --> 32:28.729
just exited.

32:28.772 --> 32:29.904
My God.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.688
Those marshals are gonna be
outgunned.

32:40.871 --> 32:43.265
ERIC:
Callen, we can't reach
the marshals

32:43.309 --> 32:45.050
in the prisoner transport.
They're all off-line.

32:45.093 --> 32:46.486
CALLEN:
Got it. Alert LAPD

32:46.529 --> 32:48.575
we may have shooters
in the area with fully-automatic

32:48.618 --> 32:50.490
assault rifles.NELL:
Copy that. The nearest

32:50.533 --> 32:52.187
SWAT team is 15 minutes out.

32:52.231 --> 32:53.884
SAM:
We're a mile out and closing.

32:53.928 --> 32:55.408
Kensi and Deeks
are five minutes out.

32:55.451 --> 32:58.019
CALLEN:
Yeah, well, tell 'em
we need them there in two.

33:03.329 --> 33:05.026
That's Ross.

33:05.070 --> 33:06.854
CALLEN:
Kensi, Deeks,
Ross is in on it.

33:06.897 --> 33:08.508
They hit the marshals.
Shooters on site.

33:08.551 --> 33:09.988
DEEKS:
Ross. That son of a bitch.

33:15.906 --> 33:17.125
Moving!

33:45.936 --> 33:47.982
CALLEN:
Kens, Deeks, what's your 20?

33:48.026 --> 33:49.636
DEEKS:
Present.

33:49.679 --> 33:51.420
SAM:
Better late than never.

33:51.464 --> 33:54.554
Yeah, well, never's sounding
pretty damn good right now.

33:59.298 --> 34:01.909
I can't get a
clear shot. Moving!

34:01.952 --> 34:03.954
Move!

34:09.134 --> 34:10.570
SAM:
Ross, drop your weapon.

34:10.613 --> 34:12.572
Reloading.

34:15.705 --> 34:17.707
CALLEN:
Sam, stay down.

34:18.926 --> 34:20.928
DEEKS:
Ross, drop the weapon.

34:51.176 --> 34:53.352
There you are.
I was looking for you.

34:53.395 --> 34:55.615
Oh. Sorry.
Should I not be in here?

34:55.658 --> 34:58.052
Oh. No, no, it's
totally fine.

35:00.185 --> 35:03.623
I was just looking
for someplace to...

35:03.666 --> 35:05.015
I get it.

35:05.059 --> 35:07.017
My spot's usually
in the burn room.

35:08.018 --> 35:09.281
Um,

35:09.324 --> 35:11.761
you did some really great work
today, Fatima.

35:15.069 --> 35:17.027
You do that?

35:17.071 --> 35:19.117
What we just did--

35:19.160 --> 35:21.119
you do that all the time?

35:21.162 --> 35:23.338
No, not all the time.

35:23.382 --> 35:25.166
I mean, sometimes.

35:27.864 --> 35:31.172
Okay, maybe more
than sometimes, actually.

35:34.306 --> 35:37.787
What if... what if Callen and
Sam didn't get to the theater

35:37.831 --> 35:39.659
and more people were killed
by that bomb?

35:39.702 --> 35:42.531
Or... or we didn't
figure out

35:42.575 --> 35:44.185
that they were targeting
the airport,

35:44.229 --> 35:46.666
and-and that bomb exploded
in a crowded terminal?No, no.

35:46.709 --> 35:48.320
Don't play the "what if" game.

35:48.363 --> 35:50.670
I'm not built for this.

35:52.062 --> 35:53.368
I'm not like you.

35:53.412 --> 35:55.370
Do you think I'mbuilt for this?

35:55.414 --> 35:57.459
You're so calm and...

35:57.503 --> 35:59.635
...in control.
I mean,

35:59.679 --> 36:01.420
you can separate
your emotions from...

36:01.463 --> 36:02.812
Oh, Fatima,

36:02.856 --> 36:06.207
I barely hold it together
most days.

36:06.251 --> 36:10.385
No, I most certainly
am notbuilt for this.

36:10.429 --> 36:12.648
When I first started here,
this work was

36:12.692 --> 36:14.607
completely
foreign to me.

36:14.650 --> 36:16.565
I mean, I never even dreamed
of having

36:16.609 --> 36:18.915
a job like this.Then why?

36:23.920 --> 36:25.879
Well...

36:25.922 --> 36:28.011
because I believe
in the work we do here,

36:28.055 --> 36:30.144
and...

36:30.188 --> 36:34.017
I really like being part
of this team.

36:37.586 --> 36:39.545
This team is pretty rad.

36:39.588 --> 36:41.851
I mean, it's the raddest.

36:45.725 --> 36:48.684
I... I spoke
with Omar's wife Bana.

36:48.728 --> 36:50.860
God, she must be so devastated.

36:50.904 --> 36:53.254
I'm gonna get coffee
with her tomorrow.

36:53.298 --> 36:54.777
She's been through a lot.

36:54.821 --> 36:56.823
Wow. That's really nice.

37:00.783 --> 37:03.133
All right.

37:03.177 --> 37:05.092
I got to know.

37:05.135 --> 37:08.313
Are you really a rich kid
from Beverly Hills?

37:10.619 --> 37:12.578
Born in Mashhad,
raised in Beverly Hills.

37:12.621 --> 37:13.927
Ooh.

37:13.970 --> 37:16.582
This Midwestern girl has
so many questions.

37:16.625 --> 37:19.106
Madeo for Italian food,
Murat's for your tailoring.

37:19.149 --> 37:20.934
Mm. What about pizza?

37:20.977 --> 37:22.414
Mulberry's.

37:22.457 --> 37:24.198
Of course.

37:33.947 --> 37:35.296
Louis.

37:35.340 --> 37:36.950
Madam Undersecretary.

37:36.993 --> 37:40.388
Hell of a few days for your team
out here in the City of Angels.

37:40.432 --> 37:41.868
Yes. Yes, it was, ma'am.

37:41.911 --> 37:44.958
But they're not my team.

37:45.001 --> 37:48.875
Regardless. It's quite a feat
to expose a corrupt FBI agent,

37:48.918 --> 37:51.312
especially one
as accomplished as Ross.

37:51.356 --> 37:53.575
Ross was smart.
He knew that as long

37:53.619 --> 37:55.447
as the focus was
on the Mashriq Army,

37:55.490 --> 37:58.014
no one would be tracking
his moves to free Jandre Els.

37:58.058 --> 37:59.973
That's where
Abbas Jalal came in.

38:00.016 --> 38:01.366
Yeah, once

38:01.409 --> 38:03.846
Agents Nelson and Yim had Jalal
in custody,

38:03.890 --> 38:05.326
Ross had the cover he needed.

38:05.370 --> 38:07.720
All it took then was tipping off
the mercenaries.

38:07.763 --> 38:10.331
So I didn't know you were
coming to Los Angeles.

38:10.375 --> 38:13.378
I didn't either, and then
one thing led to another,

38:13.421 --> 38:16.642
and now here I am,
booking a hot yoga class

38:16.685 --> 38:18.818
while drinking
a kale pressed juice.

38:18.861 --> 38:21.211
I'm almost a local.

38:21.255 --> 38:23.475
That's not something
to aspire to.Ah.

38:23.518 --> 38:24.998
You've been here
a fair amount of time.

38:25.041 --> 38:27.348
So let's cut to the chase.

38:27.392 --> 38:31.221
Should this team be disbanded
or not?

38:33.223 --> 38:34.747
You've wanted to know
for a long time

38:34.790 --> 38:38.011
if this team is dangerous,
operating outside of the lines,

38:38.054 --> 38:41.319
putting not only the citizens
but our organization at risk.

38:41.362 --> 38:42.755
Right?

38:42.798 --> 38:44.191
About sums it up.

38:44.234 --> 38:45.627
You've sent

38:45.671 --> 38:47.760
a long list of people out here
to get those answers.

38:47.803 --> 38:50.415
A few, but only two
that I trust.

38:50.458 --> 38:52.330
Thank you.

38:52.373 --> 38:55.811
You presume that you accompany
Admiral Kilbride on that list?

39:00.294 --> 39:02.252
You know,

39:02.296 --> 39:04.385
they're a good team.

39:04.429 --> 39:06.866
They're better
than good. They're

39:06.909 --> 39:08.433
tip of the spear, top-notch.

39:08.476 --> 39:10.913
They only want for one thing.

39:10.957 --> 39:12.828
What's that?

39:12.872 --> 39:15.396
Henrietta Lange.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.877
I've never seen

39:17.920 --> 39:20.096
such loyalty
in a command structure before.

39:20.140 --> 39:22.403
Well, she handpicked them.

39:22.447 --> 39:24.623
One of them, she practically
raised from childhood.

39:24.666 --> 39:29.323
But my ten-dollar juice
is getting warm.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.456
What's your official
recommendation?

39:39.333 --> 39:41.291
Don't break them up.

39:41.335 --> 39:44.904
Let them do
what they do.

39:44.947 --> 39:48.255
They can operate without Hetty.

39:48.298 --> 39:51.040
And without you?

39:56.219 --> 39:58.221
Very well.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.098
And, Louis, I, um...

40:07.100 --> 40:09.668
I truly appreciate
you taking this assignment.

40:09.711 --> 40:13.411
I know the timing
has been less than ideal.

40:15.108 --> 40:17.415
How is Mariana doing?

40:18.459 --> 40:20.026
I don't know.

40:20.069 --> 40:22.637
She stopped letting me help her
about a month ago.

40:24.073 --> 40:26.685
I've dealt with addiction
in my family.

40:26.728 --> 40:29.731
If there is ever anything

40:29.775 --> 40:31.820
I can do for you
or your daughter...

40:34.432 --> 40:36.390
The worst part?

40:36.434 --> 40:39.611
The person in the world
I want to help the most,

40:39.654 --> 40:41.743
I can do the least for.

40:46.705 --> 40:49.055
It's time to go home, Louis.

41:10.293 --> 41:12.252
You guys stop
at the hospital?

41:12.295 --> 41:14.863
We did. Elias's surgery
went perfectly.

41:14.907 --> 41:17.692
Only lingering effects
should be a few scars.

41:17.736 --> 41:19.694
He's a tough kid.

41:19.738 --> 41:21.261
He's already talking
about getting back

41:21.304 --> 41:22.828
on the wrestling mat.Wow.

41:22.871 --> 41:25.570
Jandre Els put this city through
hell for his own freedom.

41:25.613 --> 41:27.093
Not just that.

41:27.136 --> 41:28.921
I mean, he had Ross
disguise his escape

41:28.964 --> 41:30.531
as an attack
by Islamic terrorists.

41:30.575 --> 41:32.533
Yeah, well,
L.A. is so divided right now.

41:32.577 --> 41:34.579
He knew another attack would
throw gas on the fire.

41:34.622 --> 41:35.754
Mm-hmm.He didn't care.

41:35.797 --> 41:37.930
The fire and smoke
of the city burning

41:37.973 --> 41:39.453
would have hid
his escape.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.455
Except the city
didn't burn.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.501
It did not.

41:47.505 --> 41:50.333
âª I will leave the light on

41:54.599 --> 41:57.863
âª I will leave the light on

42:01.040 --> 42:02.911
âª I will leave the light on

42:02.955 --> 42:04.783
âª And I know
you're down and out now âª

42:04.826 --> 42:06.611
âª But I need you to be brave

42:06.654 --> 42:09.788
âª Hiding from the truth
ain't gonna make this all okay âª

42:09.831 --> 42:12.355
âª I feel your pain,
if you don't feel our grace âª

42:12.399 --> 42:14.749
âª And you've lost your way

42:14.793 --> 42:18.013
âª Well, I will leave
the light on âª
