WEBVTT

00:04.938 --> 00:08.974
Thanks for giving my bike
a spring tune-up, Parker.

00:08.976 --> 00:10.509
No problem, munch.

00:10.511 --> 00:11.910
I wanna make sure
the thing that carries you

00:11.912 --> 00:14.580
away from here
is working at all times.

00:16.149 --> 00:17.850
All right, boys, clear out.

00:17.852 --> 00:19.251
Varsity softball tryouts
are coming up,

00:19.253 --> 00:21.253
and I need the backyard
to practice.

00:21.255 --> 00:22.988
Forget it, Maddie.

00:22.990 --> 00:24.556
We were here first.

00:25.525 --> 00:26.792
Hi, Joey.

00:26.794 --> 00:27.860
Oh, dear.

00:29.963 --> 00:31.964
Backyard is all yours, Maddie.

00:33.566 --> 00:34.700
No, I wasn't finished!

00:34.702 --> 00:36.635
<i>- ( Screams )</i>
<i>- ( Crashes )</i>

00:40.040 --> 00:42.674
The backyard's
all yours, Maddie.

00:45.145 --> 00:47.212
<i>( Theme music plays )</i>

00:47.214 --> 00:48.847
<i>¶ Better in stereo</i>

00:48.849 --> 00:50.716

00:50.718 --> 00:53.118

01:32.960 --> 01:34.793

01:38.264 --> 01:39.598
( Sighs )

01:39.600 --> 01:40.732
It's here! It's here.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.234
My future is here.

01:42.236 --> 01:43.669
My future is here!

01:43.671 --> 01:45.637
Between two slices of bread.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.774
Your future can wait.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.909
Look.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.526
That's the costume
from "space werewolves."

01:55.782 --> 01:57.983
"Space werewolves"
is a big action blockbuster

01:57.985 --> 02:00.319
that's gonna be kind of
like the next "twilight,"

02:00.321 --> 02:03.188
except it's werewolves in space
instead of vampires on earth.

02:03.190 --> 02:04.323
It's way more believable.

02:05.992 --> 02:08.227
So, you got the lead
in the movie.

02:08.229 --> 02:10.762
No. They actually don't think a
girl will look tough enough.

02:10.764 --> 02:12.731
So you stole the suit

02:12.733 --> 02:14.266
so they can't make the movie.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.201
You are diabolical.

02:17.403 --> 02:19.805
Actually, I talked them into
sending me the werewolf suit

02:19.807 --> 02:21.640
so I can take pictures in it
to prove them wrong.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.276
That could work too.

02:24.278 --> 02:26.178
I like you better diabolical.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.279
( Chuckles )

02:27.281 --> 02:29.148
Liv, great news.

02:29.150 --> 02:30.382
Channel four just called.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.251
They're coming to the house
this Friday

02:32.253 --> 02:33.385
to interview you

02:33.387 --> 02:36.088
for their morning news
cooking segment.

02:36.090 --> 02:38.891
I'm doing
"nibbling with nimbus"?

02:38.893 --> 02:40.792
Yes.
Can you believe it?

02:40.794 --> 02:42.327
I love that segment.

02:42.329 --> 02:47.199
Last week, nimbus deep fried
a Turkey with vin diesel.

02:47.201 --> 02:49.234
Wait, mom, did you say Friday?

02:50.370 --> 02:53.138
So a "space werewolves"
movie photo shoot

02:53.140 --> 02:54.806
and a live TV interview.

02:54.808 --> 02:58.377
Okay, this is shaping up
to be an oddly stressful week.

02:58.379 --> 03:01.480
Well, luckily you have
a super-cool mom

03:01.482 --> 03:04.883
who's also a therapist. And she
can help you manage your stress.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.685
Good. Because I am
going to need your help

03:06.687 --> 03:08.353
picking out
a TV-rrific outfit.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.888
You want my fashion advice.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.290
Oh, it's finally happening.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.791
Okay.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.793
How about a peasant blouse

03:14.795 --> 03:17.429
with some sensible trousers?

03:17.431 --> 03:19.031
Yeah, this was a mistake.

03:22.168 --> 03:23.402
Green belts,

03:23.404 --> 03:25.070
the path of the dragon

03:25.072 --> 03:26.338
is not easy.

03:29.275 --> 03:31.276
Hyah!

03:31.278 --> 03:33.145
Do not be scared.

03:33.147 --> 03:35.080
The fly lives, barely.

03:35.082 --> 03:36.381
<i>( Fly buzzes )</i>

03:36.383 --> 03:40.385
that distractions
will not be tolerated.

03:42.288 --> 03:45.090
Wow, sensei rae dawn
is no joke.

03:45.092 --> 03:47.292
I heard if you look
directly in her eyes,

03:47.294 --> 03:50.762
she can steal your soul.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.764
Dragon Parker,

03:52.766 --> 03:54.399
are you ready to advance
from green belt

03:54.401 --> 03:57.002
by unleashing your inner dragon

03:57.004 --> 04:00.038
and performing
the leaping dragon back-kick?

04:00.040 --> 04:02.174
( Exhales ) Ready, sensei.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.444
Hyah!

04:05.446 --> 04:07.279
( Cheers )

04:07.281 --> 04:10.382
Impressive, young dragon.

04:11.351 --> 04:12.851
Your belt.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.021
Remind your parents
it's 9.95 for the new belt

04:16.023 --> 04:17.789
and 1.20 for
the target you broke.

04:21.361 --> 04:22.828
Dragon Evan,

04:22.830 --> 04:25.130
- are you ready...
- Let me stop you right there.

04:26.332 --> 04:28.533
My mom says I can't
unleash my dragon today.

04:28.535 --> 04:30.135
Excuse me?

04:30.137 --> 04:32.304
She thinks I shouldn't
participate in an activity

04:32.306 --> 04:35.207
where kids are judged
in terms of winning or failing.

04:36.309 --> 04:38.510
Especially when
I'm going to fail.

04:41.314 --> 04:42.881
Anyway I can get a blue belt

04:42.883 --> 04:44.283
by being open about my feelings

04:44.285 --> 04:46.451
and talking out issues?

04:47.487 --> 04:51.356
Seems your inner dragon
is more of a salamander.

04:51.358 --> 04:52.991
No belt for you.

04:52.993 --> 04:55.794
You have one week
to earn your blue belt

04:55.796 --> 04:58.830
or endure the shame of
watching the rest of the class

04:58.832 --> 05:01.233
move on to the 2:30
Tuesday slot

05:01.235 --> 05:03.068
without you.

05:04.837 --> 05:07.105
There was no way
I was gonna let the sensei

05:07.107 --> 05:08.307
break up the team of

05:08.309 --> 05:10.175
super-awesome
martial arts dude

05:10.177 --> 05:11.843
and his beloved sidekick,

05:11.845 --> 05:15.814
freckles,
the smiling salamander.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.015
Yeah.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.417
Evan might need a new nickname.

05:19.835 --> 05:21.120
Okay, willow, ready?

05:21.121 --> 05:23.555
Focus. Fire one at me.
Right here.

05:26.526 --> 05:28.293
Perfect...

05:28.295 --> 05:31.129
If we were playing
"smash that pot."

05:33.099 --> 05:35.500
Willow, you've been
in a slump for days.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.336
I just can't concentrate.

05:37.338 --> 05:39.504
Okay, well, softball
tryouts are this weekend,

05:39.506 --> 05:41.306
and if we want to be the first
sophomores to make varsity,

05:41.308 --> 05:42.507
then you gotta get
your head in the game.

05:42.509 --> 05:45.010
What is your problem?

05:45.012 --> 05:46.845
You know what?
I just don't feel comfortable

05:46.847 --> 05:48.180
talking about it.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.381
Okay, well,
we have to get to the bottom

05:49.383 --> 05:51.316
of whatever this is
before tryouts.

05:51.318 --> 05:52.584
And if you're not
willing to talk to me,

05:52.586 --> 05:54.186
then maybe we need
some professional help.

05:54.188 --> 05:56.321
( Gasps ) Did someone say
"professional help"?

05:56.323 --> 05:58.423
( Pants )

05:58.425 --> 06:00.926
It is finally happening.

06:02.929 --> 06:05.397
Thank you for seeing me
in my office.

06:05.399 --> 06:08.934
Thank you for the ride.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.937
Well, I thought we would
be more comfortable here.

06:11.939 --> 06:14.106
And I thought you'd be
more receptive to my words

06:14.108 --> 06:15.474
if you could see
all my degrees.

06:18.311 --> 06:20.078
So, willow can't pitch.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.980
Exactly. Fix her.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.449
So you tell me

06:24.451 --> 06:27.185
what is the first thing

06:27.187 --> 06:29.388
that pops into your head.

06:29.390 --> 06:30.455
Joey.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.359
Joey.

06:37.930 --> 06:40.332
Joey on a horse
that looks like Joey.

06:42.168 --> 06:43.435
Okay.

06:43.437 --> 06:45.103
I'm gonna go out on a limb here

06:45.105 --> 06:47.439
and say that this has something

06:47.441 --> 06:48.507
to do with Joey.

06:50.109 --> 06:51.443
Wow, you're good.

06:52.512 --> 06:55.380
( Scoffs ) Joey?

06:55.382 --> 06:56.448
This whole thing is about Joey?

06:56.450 --> 06:57.916
Maddie, this is a safe place.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.251
We do not judge,

06:59.253 --> 07:00.318
even if it is the first place

07:00.320 --> 07:01.987
your brain wants to go.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.158
Okay, so what is going on
with you and Joey?

07:06.160 --> 07:08.427
Nothing.
That's the problem.

07:08.450 --> 07:09.429
It's springtime.

07:09.430 --> 07:13.331
Love is in the air,
birds are chirping,

07:13.333 --> 07:15.200
but all I can think about is

07:15.202 --> 07:19.004
why doesn't my sweet
little Joey bird chirp at me?

07:19.006 --> 07:22.307
Okay, what... what does Joey
have to do with your pitching?

07:22.309 --> 07:24.376
I can't concentrate.

07:24.378 --> 07:26.978
When I pitch,
I look directly at you.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.314
- Right.
- But every time I look at you,

07:29.316 --> 07:31.349
all I see is Joey.

07:33.319 --> 07:34.986
I look like Joey?!
No, okay.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.588
( Clears throat )
We both wear glasses,

07:36.590 --> 07:39.658
but that is where
the similarity ends, right?

07:39.660 --> 07:41.126
Right?!

07:42.195 --> 07:43.728
So the reason you
stink at pitching

07:43.730 --> 07:47.332
Yeah. You guys look
exactly like each other.

07:47.334 --> 07:48.667
Except he makes it work.

07:57.343 --> 07:59.377
Oh, good, you're here.
I really need to talk.

07:59.379 --> 08:01.379
Oh, I'm all ears.

08:01.381 --> 08:02.581
( Chuckles )

08:04.183 --> 08:06.451
Okay, willow's in a slump
and she can't pitch,

08:06.453 --> 08:08.720
and that's gonna keep her
from making varsity softball.

08:08.722 --> 08:11.189
( Groans ) Sports.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.592
( Groans )

08:15.328 --> 08:17.462
But the reason she can't pitch

08:17.464 --> 08:19.331
is because she can't
concentrate on anything

08:19.333 --> 08:21.066
other than her
massive crush on Joey.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.401
Ooh, feelings.
Yay.

08:24.605 --> 08:29.207
and I wish she would realize that
there's so much more out there

08:29.209 --> 08:31.510
in the world for her
other than just Joey.

08:31.512 --> 08:35.413
Okay, so make her see
that there's more out there.

08:35.415 --> 08:38.683
( Gasps ) Put a love note
from a secret admirer

08:38.685 --> 08:41.419
in her locker, and she'll
forget all about Joey.

08:41.421 --> 08:44.356
Liv, that's actually
a really good idea.

08:44.358 --> 08:47.058
Actually, I remember
in fourth grade

08:47.060 --> 08:49.327
when I was so obsessed
with marky Stevens

08:49.329 --> 08:51.329
that I literally
couldn't even play kickball.

08:51.331 --> 08:54.332
And then I got
a secret admirer note from...

08:54.334 --> 08:56.434
You.

08:58.337 --> 09:00.338
And who went on
to win top prize

09:00.340 --> 09:02.274
in the school
kickball-y thing?

09:02.276 --> 09:03.508
Uh-huh,
you're welcome.

09:10.683 --> 09:12.183
- Whatcha doing?
- Ooh!

09:13.686 --> 09:15.787
Do not sneak up
on me like that.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.789
What are you doing
at willow's locker?

09:17.791 --> 09:21.826
More importantly, what am I
doing at willow's locker?

09:21.828 --> 09:23.662
Is that a note?

09:23.664 --> 09:25.664
Yeah, actually,
don't tell anyone,

09:25.666 --> 09:27.332
but I'm doing us both a favor.

09:27.334 --> 09:30.402
to get willow to stop
obsessing about you.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.337
I hope you wrote a good one.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.339
Willow's got a bad
case of the Joeys,

09:34.341 --> 09:36.474
and I'm not sure
there's a cure.

09:39.211 --> 09:42.213
Hmm, the hairs on the back
of my neck just stood up.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.583
Willow's coming.
Run.

09:55.695 --> 09:57.495
Hey, Joey.

09:57.497 --> 09:59.230
( Imitating Joey )
Hey, beautiful.

10:01.367 --> 10:02.701
( Normal voice ) What's this?

10:05.805 --> 10:08.340
Secret admirer?

10:08.342 --> 10:10.342
Oh-ho. No way.

10:10.344 --> 10:11.810
It looks like she's buying it.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.345
( Chuckles )

10:13.347 --> 10:15.680
Stop standing like me.

10:15.682 --> 10:17.749
We do not look alike.

10:23.422 --> 10:25.690
Evan, I know
you're disappointed

10:25.692 --> 10:27.425
that you didn't
get your blue belt.

10:27.427 --> 10:28.693
Actually, I'm cool.

10:28.695 --> 10:31.162
I've accepted it
as a part of life's journey.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.365
Come on, Evan.
We're a team.

10:33.367 --> 10:34.633
That can't be
how you really feel.

10:34.635 --> 10:37.202
You're right.
My mom told me to say that.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.138
You wouldn't believe
the things I've accepted

10:40.140 --> 10:42.707
as part of life's journey.

10:42.709 --> 10:44.542
But I really do
want my blue belt.

10:44.544 --> 10:47.379
Then we've got to unleash
your inner dragon.

10:47.381 --> 10:49.614
If you don't become a blue belt

10:49.616 --> 10:51.216
by our next class,

10:51.218 --> 10:52.350
we move on without you.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.752
Hey, just because I stink

10:53.754 --> 10:55.720
doesn't mean I don't
understand English.

10:57.356 --> 11:00.358
We are gonna get you
angry enough

11:00.360 --> 11:04.262
to release all your
pent up inner aggression.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.698
This is the new
balance plate lunchbox

11:06.700 --> 11:08.700
your mom made you get, right?

11:08.702 --> 11:11.369
But didn't you want
the cool ufc lunchbox

11:11.371 --> 11:14.205
with the dude's
eyeball falling out?

11:14.207 --> 11:15.840
My mom thought
it was too violent.

11:15.842 --> 11:19.544
Plus, this one had
a carrot thermos.

11:19.546 --> 11:22.714
Evan, if you want
that cool ufc lunchbox,

11:22.716 --> 11:24.849
you need to smash
the balance plate.

11:24.851 --> 11:28.186
Come on, dude. Reach down
deep and breathe some fire.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.289
( Exhales )

11:33.492 --> 11:35.226
You know, I better not.

11:36.262 --> 11:37.662
Mom says if I
don't bring it home,

11:37.664 --> 11:38.897
I don't get my dessert.

11:38.899 --> 11:40.532
And you know how
I love raw almonds.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.804
Liv, you ready for your
"space werewolves" photo shoot?

11:48.541 --> 11:50.709
Stand back, humanoid,

11:50.711 --> 11:52.444
or feel my fury.

11:52.446 --> 11:55.213
( Hisses )

11:55.215 --> 11:57.749
Whoa.
You look awesome.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.384
( Squeals ) Thanks, dad.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.553
( Giggles ) Now let's do this.

12:03.923 --> 12:05.590
- Snarl.
- ( Snarls )

12:05.592 --> 12:06.725
- <i>Growl.</i>
<i>- ( Growls )</i>

12:06.727 --> 12:08.693
- Howl.
- ( Howls )

12:08.695 --> 12:11.329
Show me fierce.

12:11.331 --> 12:12.697
Boom, pow, wha-cha!

12:16.502 --> 12:17.635
No!

12:17.637 --> 12:19.637
Dad, the armor glue
they sent me

12:19.639 --> 12:21.339
said it's supposed
to be permanent.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.374
Don't worry.
I got some fantastic shots

12:23.376 --> 12:24.642
before your suit fell apart.

12:24.644 --> 12:27.245
Oh, great.
That one's perfect.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.247
Now I can take these
itchy ears off.

12:29.249 --> 12:33.251
( Chuckles ) Ow.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.253
( Chuckles ) They're stuck.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.788
Oh, okay.
So are my fangs.

12:39.725 --> 12:41.860
That's so weird.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.394
The makeup glue
that they sent me

12:43.396 --> 12:45.396
says it's only supposed
to last 20 minutes.

12:46.332 --> 12:48.500
And the armor glue says

12:48.502 --> 12:50.401
"permanent."

13:01.113 --> 13:02.447
Hey, mads.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.516
What a beautiful day.

13:04.518 --> 13:06.384
I see heart shapes
in the clouds,

13:06.386 --> 13:10.288
and the air smells
like Jasmine and hot dogs.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.692
I got a note from
a secret admirer.

13:14.694 --> 13:16.594
- You did?
- ( Both squeal )

13:16.596 --> 13:17.662
( Clears throat )

13:19.398 --> 13:21.299
Wow, that's totally unlike us.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.501
Yeah, let's please
never do that again.

13:25.604 --> 13:27.939
But I can't really
say I'm surprised.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.407
You are a top-notch lady

13:29.409 --> 13:31.743
who any guy would
be lucky to have.

13:31.745 --> 13:34.479
Now let's get us
on that varsity squad.

13:34.481 --> 13:37.515
Turn my hand into
a bloody pulp.

13:37.517 --> 13:41.452
My secret admirer
is Joey Rooney.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.688
My little Joey bird
finally chirped back!

13:45.925 --> 13:47.458
Wait, Joey?

13:47.460 --> 13:49.180
There was nothing
in that note about Joey...

13:50.396 --> 13:53.398
I'm assuming because
you said it was a secret.

13:55.401 --> 13:56.935
For the first time in weeks,

13:56.937 --> 13:59.571
my mind is clear
and I can concentrate.

13:59.573 --> 14:01.472
I mean,
it's obviously Joey, right?

14:01.474 --> 14:02.674
( Chuckles nervously )

14:02.676 --> 14:04.409
Okay, so I know
I should have come clean

14:04.411 --> 14:05.944
right then and there
to protect my brother

14:05.946 --> 14:07.045
and my best friend,

14:07.047 --> 14:10.715
but in my defense...

14:10.717 --> 14:11.783
Yeah, okay.
I got nothing.

14:13.052 --> 14:15.386
Sure. Yeah.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.455
Why not?
( Nervous chuckle )

14:17.457 --> 14:20.525
The point is that you
are out of your slump

14:20.527 --> 14:23.494
and now we can get you
ready for tryouts.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.363
Yeah, about that.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.631
I'm quitting softball.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.399
What?!

14:28.401 --> 14:29.934
Willow, you can't.

14:29.936 --> 14:32.070
Relationships take work.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.538
This thing I have
going on with Joey

14:33.540 --> 14:34.772
has to be my top priority.

14:36.542 --> 14:37.842
See you later, mads,

14:37.844 --> 14:39.544
if I ever come back
down to earth.

14:41.780 --> 14:43.414
Wow.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.817
There really is no cure
for a bad case of the Joeys.

14:51.457 --> 14:53.992
Young dragons,

14:53.994 --> 14:56.594
before we give the weak link

14:56.596 --> 14:58.396
known as Evan

14:58.398 --> 15:00.164
<i>his final chance</i>

15:00.166 --> 15:05.536
take a few moments
to feed your inner dragons.

15:07.072 --> 15:09.540
It's snack time.
Work with me here.

15:10.609 --> 15:12.810
I was about to give up
and look for a new sidekick

15:12.812 --> 15:14.946
when I remembered
the time Evan lost it

15:14.948 --> 15:17.081
because his mom
gave him seaweed chips.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.083
So I swapped out
his raw almonds

15:19.085 --> 15:21.152
for some of that
disgusting water weed.

15:22.755 --> 15:27.425
At least we get to have
snack together one last time.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.093
Are you ready for your snack?

15:29.095 --> 15:30.628
You should have your snack.

15:32.097 --> 15:36.434
- I'm not really that...
- I said eat your snack.

15:39.738 --> 15:41.639
I can't believe this!

15:41.641 --> 15:42.707
What's wrong?

15:42.709 --> 15:44.142
It's seaweed chips!

15:44.144 --> 15:46.577
Unsalted, organic,
seaweed chips.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.179
I keep telling
my mom I hate them.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.081
Give me carrot sticks or celery

15:50.083 --> 15:51.215
or even rutabaga,

15:51.217 --> 15:53.685
just not seaweed chips!

15:54.753 --> 15:55.954
Come on, dude.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.556
Listen to your mom and eat it!

15:58.558 --> 16:00.758
I won't eat seaweed!

16:00.760 --> 16:03.061
( Shouts )

16:03.063 --> 16:04.295
( Yells )

16:04.297 --> 16:06.097
( Grunts )

16:07.466 --> 16:09.233
What, what?!

16:09.235 --> 16:10.835
( Shouts, grunts continue )

16:12.237 --> 16:13.671
( Screams )

16:13.673 --> 16:15.073
( Gasping )

16:16.208 --> 16:17.475
I'm a good friend.

16:19.211 --> 16:21.479
Who else wants some?

16:21.481 --> 16:23.915
Dragon Evan,

16:23.917 --> 16:25.249
that was your inner dragon.

16:25.251 --> 16:26.784
It's been released!

16:26.786 --> 16:29.253
You are ready for
your blue belt now.

16:29.255 --> 16:31.889
Yes! Evan, you did it.

16:31.891 --> 16:33.958
Tell me something
that I don't know.

16:35.494 --> 16:37.528
Try to keep up, munch.

16:42.568 --> 16:44.802
Good morning, Stevens point.

16:44.804 --> 16:47.505
And welcome to
"nibblin' with nimbus"

16:47.507 --> 16:50.241
where every week, Wisconsin's
favorite meteorologist...

16:50.243 --> 16:52.243
this guy...
cooks up some breakfast

16:52.245 --> 16:55.913
for one of Stevens point's most
intriguing residents or visitors.

16:55.915 --> 16:58.216
And this week, we got
a tasty combination

16:58.218 --> 16:59.784
of breakfast brats

16:59.786 --> 17:01.285
and the always flavorful star

17:01.287 --> 17:04.222
of "sing it loud," Liv Rooney.

17:05.557 --> 17:07.225
I tried all night

17:07.227 --> 17:09.227
to get my ears
and my fangs off.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.629
They wouldn't budge.
I tried cancelling

17:11.631 --> 17:14.098
and Johnny nimbus
showed up anyway.

17:14.100 --> 17:16.234
So I did what any
great actress would do.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.302
I hid my flaws with
wardrobe and props.

17:19.772 --> 17:21.839
Live and in person,
here she is now.

17:27.179 --> 17:29.047
Wow, Liv Rooney,

17:29.049 --> 17:32.550
Tell me, is that what all the
kids are wearing these days?

17:32.552 --> 17:36.120
'Cause if not, they will be
after watching this.

17:36.122 --> 17:37.555
Ah, who am I kidding?

17:37.557 --> 17:39.090
No kids are
watching this program.

17:41.093 --> 17:44.328
Johnny, you are adorable.

17:44.330 --> 17:47.098
So tell us, what are you
cooking up this morning?

17:47.100 --> 17:49.233
Well, I got a griddle
full of brats

17:49.235 --> 17:52.236
and a side order of
get to know you.

17:52.238 --> 17:56.040
Okay, now these eggs
are ready for poaching.

17:56.042 --> 17:58.242
And here's a secret
I learned from Nana nimbus.

17:58.244 --> 18:01.312
Don't use water.
Use chicken broth instead.

18:01.314 --> 18:02.413
Liv Rooney, could you
open that for me.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.015
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

18:05.250 --> 18:08.786
( Chuckles )

18:08.788 --> 18:10.188
<i>( Bites, can crunches )</i>

18:11.990 --> 18:13.324
Here you go, Johnny.

18:13.326 --> 18:15.126
Wow! That was quick.

18:15.128 --> 18:17.628
All right.
Now get poaching.

18:17.630 --> 18:18.763
There you go.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.231
Just liberally
putting it in there.

18:20.233 --> 18:21.866
They're gonna taste great.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.367
Okay. Now.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.169
Let's sit down to chew the fat.

18:25.171 --> 18:26.304
And I mean that literally.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.606
These brats are 90% fat.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.212
Well, come on, Liv.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.246
Come on over and
sink your teeth

18:35.248 --> 18:36.848
into one of these babies.

18:39.318 --> 18:40.718
Oopsie-Daisy.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.286
Oh, Liv, here.
Let me help you up.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.955
Here... oh!

18:45.224 --> 18:46.357
Either I've had
too much coffee,

18:46.359 --> 18:48.092
or werewolves are real!

18:50.028 --> 18:53.798
Um... ( Chuckles )

18:53.800 --> 18:55.933
Uh, no.
Actually, Johnny,

18:55.935 --> 19:00.771
I am just giving you
a channel four exclusive.

19:00.773 --> 19:05.109
I am up for the lead
in "space werewolves,"

19:05.111 --> 19:07.245
so to get my fans excited,

19:07.247 --> 19:10.781
I decided that I would
give you a little sneak peek.

19:10.783 --> 19:11.983
- ( Growls )
- Oh!

19:13.252 --> 19:15.119
Seriously.

19:15.121 --> 19:16.361
You're kind of freaking me out.

19:21.793 --> 19:23.694
Hey, did willow get the note?

19:23.696 --> 19:26.297
- Yeah, she did, but...
- Was she happy?

19:26.299 --> 19:27.698
Well, yeah, she was...

19:27.700 --> 19:29.267
shh shh shh shh.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.869
All I needed to know
is that she's off my scent.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.337
You have served your purpose.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.039
Hey, willow.

19:35.041 --> 19:38.376
Willow willow willow.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.978
I heard you got a little
note in your locker.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.680
I did.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.449
I bet you're pretty
excited about that, huh?

19:45.451 --> 19:48.252
I say chase this rainbow
and see where it takes you.

19:49.454 --> 19:51.255
- Um, Joey...
- Maddie.

19:51.257 --> 19:52.423
Not now.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.058
I've been waiting
for this moment

19:54.060 --> 19:55.193
for a long time.

19:57.996 --> 19:59.263
I just can't take it anymore.

19:59.265 --> 20:02.266
Joey Rooney's
my secret admirer!

20:06.805 --> 20:09.340
What is happening?

20:10.809 --> 20:12.143
Yeah.

20:12.145 --> 20:14.278
Uh, I think it's best
that the three of us

20:14.280 --> 20:16.480
talk about this
in a safe place.

20:19.184 --> 20:20.251
Willow.

20:22.287 --> 20:24.322
You can put him down now.

20:24.324 --> 20:27.124
Oh, I didn't realize.

20:27.126 --> 20:28.426
It just feels so right.

20:30.128 --> 20:32.029
( Sighs ) Thank you.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.798
Punish Maddie, mom.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.467
Make her clean the bathrooms
for the next five years.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.269
Yeah, punish her.

20:38.271 --> 20:40.037
Your bathrooms could
use a little help.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.274
There are six of us
living in one house.

20:43.276 --> 20:45.343
I do the best I can.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.245
Maddie, what I'm hearing

20:47.247 --> 20:49.947
is that your brother and your
overly critical best friend

20:49.949 --> 20:51.916
are understandably upset.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.085
Willow, I was really
just trying to help.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.419
I didn't want to
see my best friend

20:55.421 --> 20:58.356
drive herself crazy
over some stupid guy.

20:58.358 --> 20:59.390
Um...

20:59.392 --> 21:03.427
The stupid guy is right here.

21:04.796 --> 21:06.797
Thanks, Maddie, but you
shouldn't have interfered.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.132
I know.

21:08.134 --> 21:10.334
And I'm sorry.

21:10.336 --> 21:15.539
who <i>so </i> does not need a guy to make
her feel better about herself.

21:15.541 --> 21:17.475
Never forget that.

21:19.811 --> 21:21.912
You're not really quitting
softball, are you?

21:21.914 --> 21:23.381
No, you're right.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.549
- We're making varsity.
- ( Grunts )

21:25.551 --> 21:29.420
I shouldn't get hung up on
what some stupid guy thinks.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.455
Again, right here.

21:33.358 --> 21:36.394
So Maddie, is there anything you
would like to say to your brother?

21:36.396 --> 21:39.297
Yeah. Joey...

21:39.299 --> 21:41.299
Did you eat the last
muffin this morning?

21:41.301 --> 21:42.533
Maddie.

21:42.535 --> 21:44.502
( Sighs )

21:44.504 --> 21:45.536
Uh...

21:45.538 --> 21:48.139
I should not have let

21:48.141 --> 21:50.041
willow think that you
were her secret admirer.

21:50.043 --> 21:51.275
Exactly.

21:51.277 --> 21:52.543
How willow and I
feel about each other

21:52.545 --> 21:53.944
is none of your business.

21:53.946 --> 21:57.448
- ( Gasps )
- Oh, no.

21:57.450 --> 22:00.418
Joey just said he and I
had feelings...

22:00.420 --> 22:02.186
About each other.

22:02.188 --> 22:04.522
( Giggles )

22:04.524 --> 22:05.423
Um, no.

22:05.425 --> 22:07.825
What I meant was...

22:07.827 --> 22:09.226
I'm going now.

22:11.897 --> 22:13.998
And Maddie,
I did eat that muffin.

22:19.004 --> 22:21.005
( Panting )

22:21.007 --> 22:22.073
Hide me!

22:25.177 --> 22:26.977
I unleashed Evan's inner dragon

22:26.979 --> 22:28.612
and now I can't put
it back in its cage.

22:29.948 --> 22:32.283
( Shouts )

22:32.285 --> 22:35.853
My dragon wants to
throw him around some more.

22:37.155 --> 22:39.256
No idea what you're
talking about, son.

22:40.359 --> 22:41.959
Don't lie to me, old man.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.361
I can see him
trembling behind you.

22:46.965 --> 22:48.899
What did I say about
running in the house?

22:48.901 --> 22:50.568
What did I say about
talking back, woman?

22:53.638 --> 22:54.905
( Squeals )

22:54.907 --> 22:56.474
Stop, drop and howl.

22:56.476 --> 22:59.176
Dad, the "space werewolves"
movie people called,

22:59.178 --> 23:01.178
and apparently
my video went viral.

23:01.180 --> 23:03.514
And the only thing they love
more than all the free publicity

23:03.516 --> 23:05.116
were all the free
pics you took.

23:05.118 --> 23:07.551
I'm back on the short
list for the lead.

23:07.553 --> 23:11.288
I'm so proud of
my little werewolf.

23:11.290 --> 23:15.326
Cage your dragon!
Cage your dragon!

23:15.328 --> 23:18.195
( Growls )

23:18.197 --> 23:19.263
Hi, Evan.

23:20.365 --> 23:21.432
( Screams )

23:24.069 --> 23:27.505
Oh, right.
( Chuckles )

23:27.507 --> 23:31.942
No wonder everyone was looking
at me so weird at the mall.
