our enchanting encounter

02:21.809 --> 02:26.397
in the lobby last week.

09:03.377 --> 09:05.484
The winning cake

09:05.485 --> 09:07.589
from Couture Cooking.

09:07.631 --> 09:10.363
Hey, we just wanted to say

09:10.364 --> 09:13.095
we totally forgive you guys

09:07.631 --> 09:13.095
for ruining the MMA fight.

09:13.137 --> 09:14.513
Looking back,

09:14.514 --> 09:15.889
shrieking that I wish

09:13.137 --> 09:15.889
I could chop you up

09:15.931 --> 09:17.766
- and feed you
- to Mrs. Kipling

09:17.808 --> 09:19.477
Might have been a slight

09:19.478 --> 09:21.145
overreaction on my part.

09:23.397 --> 09:25.190
- That's what you
- said in Hindi?

09:25.232 --> 09:26.359
I thought you were

09:26.360 --> 09:27.485
ordering take-out.

09:27.526 --> 09:29.007
- No wonder the food's
- not here yet.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.448
- You might be
- interested to know

09:32.490 --> 09:33.720
We discovered a way

09:33.721 --> 09:34.950
to view the match.

09:34.992 --> 09:36.473
As long as

09:36.474 --> 09:37.953
you're not watching it in

09:34.992 --> 09:37.953
the screening room tonight.

09:37.995 --> 09:39.559
We have the premiere of

09:39.560 --> 09:41.123
Runways and Ravioli.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.375
(WHISTLING)

09:43.417 --> 09:45.482
Bone Crusher!

09:45.483 --> 09:47.546
Skull Smasher!

09:47.587 --> 09:48.587
(BERTRAM GASPS)

09:51.133 --> 09:52.259
Who are these guys?

09:54.386 --> 09:55.617
Duh. Bone Crusher

09:55.618 --> 09:56.847
and Skull Smasher.

09:59.016 --> 10:01.060
They are being paid to

10:01.061 --> 10:03.103
recreate the bout

09:59.016 --> 10:03.103
that you spoiled for us.

10:03.145 --> 10:04.668
How much is

10:04.669 --> 10:06.190
your allowance?

10:06.231 --> 10:07.337
The question you

10:07.338 --> 10:08.442
should be asking

10:06.231 --> 10:08.442
yourself is,

10:08.484 --> 10:09.943
- (GASPS)
- "Where's my wallet"?

10:13.322 --> 10:15.324
On your mark!

10:15.325 --> 10:17.326
Get set! Mix it up!

10:17.368 --> 10:18.803
- Oh! Watch the cake!
- Watch the cake!

10:18.827 --> 10:20.079
Oh, I sure hope nothing

10:20.080 --> 10:21.330
bad happens to it.

10:21.372 --> 10:23.541
Yes, it is awful

10:23.542 --> 10:25.709
when something you care

10:21.372 --> 10:25.709
deeply about is ruined.

10:32.257 --> 10:32.841
My cake!

10:32.883 --> 10:34.801
My dress!

10:38.680 --> 10:39.973
- It is true what
- they say,

10:40.849 --> 10:42.642
Revenge is sweet.

10:42.684 --> 10:43.852
- Ha-ha!
- Ha-ha!

10:48.482 --> 10:49.650
Tony, are you sure

10:49.651 --> 10:50.817
you want to go through

10:48.482 --> 10:50.817
with this?

10:50.859 --> 10:52.069
I mean, I thought

10:52.070 --> 10:53.278
you loved living in your

10:50.859 --> 10:53.278
mom's scrapbooking room.

10:55.239 --> 10:56.781
- I think she
- wants me gone.

10:56.823 --> 10:57.887
This morning I woke up

10:57.888 --> 10:58.950
and the words "Get out"

10:58.992 --> 11:00.911
- was spelt in glitter
- on my forehead.

11:08.877 --> 11:11.171
Pretty great, huh?

11:11.213 --> 11:13.131
- And only two thousand
- bucks a month.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.281
You'd think $2,000

11:16.282 --> 11:17.719
would get you one window.

11:17.761 --> 11:18.761
Or less mold spores.

11:20.138 --> 11:21.306
Oh, I got a window.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.440
Ah! Really

11:29.441 --> 11:30.857
opens up the place.

11:33.110 --> 11:35.070
- But your bed can't even
- go all the way down.

11:35.112 --> 11:36.548
- The landlord said
- it's actually good

11:36.572 --> 11:38.490
- To sleep with
- your feet elevated.

11:38.532 --> 11:39.576
He says I could use

11:39.577 --> 11:40.618
more blood flow

11:38.532 --> 11:40.618
to my brain.

11:42.953 --> 11:44.121
And this neighborhood

11:44.122 --> 11:45.289
is so dangerous!

11:45.330 --> 11:48.792
Nah. It's family-friendly.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.649
See, some kid drew

11:50.650 --> 11:52.463
a chalk outline of a man at

11:48.833 --> 11:52.463
the bottom of the air shaft.

11:59.177 --> 12:01.305
Tony, this is a bad idea.

12:01.346 --> 12:02.973
No, it's not.

12:03.014 --> 12:04.182
I've been thinking a lot

12:04.183 --> 12:05.350
about my future,

12:05.392 --> 12:07.370
- and I'm ready to - start the next
- Phase of my life.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.038
- You want to start
- the next phase of your life

12:09.062 --> 12:11.303
- In a place where you can
- flip an egg from the toilet?

12:12.190 --> 12:13.942
Absolutely!

12:13.984 --> 12:15.923
That's gonna be a real

12:15.924 --> 12:17.862
time saver in the morning!

12:17.904 --> 12:19.135
Or is it gonna be weird

12:19.136 --> 12:20.365
when there's

12:17.904 --> 12:20.365
two people living here?

12:20.407 --> 12:21.575
(STAMMERING) Two people?

12:21.617 --> 12:22.826
Isn't this place

12:22.827 --> 12:24.035
small enough?

12:24.077 --> 12:26.122
And the walls

12:26.123 --> 12:28.165
seem to be closing in.

12:24.077 --> 12:28.165
Can we go?

12:28.206 --> 12:29.271
Yeah, we should

12:29.272 --> 12:30.334
get ready

12:28.206 --> 12:30.334
for dinner anyhow.

12:30.375 --> 12:31.376
I can't wait for you

12:31.377 --> 12:32.377
to meet my folks.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.608
Trust me, this is going to

12:33.609 --> 12:34.796
be a night to remember.

12:42.346 --> 12:43.639
(SCREAMING)

12:46.308 --> 12:48.101
- Hi, honey.
- Welcome home!

12:49.436 --> 12:51.104
- How did you
- get in here?

12:51.146 --> 12:52.146
I let him in.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.859
Whoo-hoo!

12:55.860 --> 12:57.902
You know I can't

12:53.815 --> 12:57.902
stand Stuart.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.488
- I know,
- that's why I did it.

13:05.744 --> 13:07.684
Stuart, get out!

13:07.685 --> 13:09.623
I don't want you here!

13:09.665 --> 13:10.938
Sounds like someone

13:10.939 --> 13:12.209
needs a foot massage.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.419
I'll go get my oils.

13:18.048 --> 13:20.842
(GROANING)

13:25.180 --> 13:26.348
Men.

13:26.390 --> 13:27.474
Boys.

13:27.516 --> 13:28.726
Tell me about it.

13:30.852 --> 13:31.875
I'm pretty sure

13:31.876 --> 13:32.896
Tony wants me to

13:30.852 --> 13:32.896
move in with him.

13:32.937 --> 13:34.127
And, I'm meeting

13:34.128 --> 13:35.315
his parents tonight!

13:35.357 --> 13:37.735
I know just how you feel.

13:37.776 --> 13:38.965
Stuart invited me to

13:38.966 --> 13:40.153
meet his turtles.

13:40.195 --> 13:41.905
- And they're both
- named Zuri!

13:43.865 --> 13:45.843
- Plus, Tony said - this would be,
- "A night to remember."

13:45.867 --> 13:47.094
- Do you think
- he's gonna propose?

13:47.118 --> 13:49.496
Why wouldn't he?

13:49.538 --> 13:51.418
- Ugh! If only I weren't
- so charming and cute!

13:53.083 --> 13:54.543
I share the same burden.

13:54.544 --> 13:56.002
Dimples are a curse.

13:58.213 --> 13:59.903
Wait. Just in case,

13:59.904 --> 14:01.592
you're coming to dinner

13:58.213 --> 14:01.592
with me tonight.

14:01.633 --> 14:02.843
He'd never ask me to

14:02.844 --> 14:04.052
marry him with a little

14:01.633 --> 14:04.052
kid hanging around.

14:05.470 --> 14:06.535
Make that

14:06.536 --> 14:07.598
two little kids!

14:07.639 --> 14:08.724
A double date is

14:08.725 --> 14:09.808
a great idea.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.184
Zuri and I need

14:11.185 --> 14:12.519
some couple friends.

14:12.561 --> 14:13.771
No, we don't.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.733
- I have to go put on
- my dinner pants.

14:20.902 --> 14:22.237
- He was here
- the whole time?

14:22.279 --> 14:24.573
It's unbelievable, right?

14:24.615 --> 14:26.533
- I had an easier time
- getting rid of lice.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.688
Boys, we have a

14:35.689 --> 14:38.002
surprise for you!

14:38.044 --> 14:39.818
Whatever you have

14:39.819 --> 14:41.590
planned for us,

14:38.044 --> 14:41.590
just know we're armed.

14:41.632 --> 14:43.196
Yes.

14:43.197 --> 14:44.760
I have a water balloon

14:41.632 --> 14:44.760
filled with permanent ink,

14:44.802 --> 14:45.865
and I am not

14:45.866 --> 14:46.928
afraid to use it.

14:46.970 --> 14:49.264
(POPPING)

14:49.306 --> 14:51.850
(STAMMERING IN DISBELIEF)

14:53.310 --> 14:55.061
(LAUGHING)

14:55.103 --> 14:57.063
- Wrong target,
- but just as funny.

14:59.316 --> 15:00.316
Idiots.

15:02.193 --> 15:03.883
Look, Bertram and I

15:03.884 --> 15:05.572
are willing to give you

15:05.614 --> 15:06.699
first dibs on

15:06.700 --> 15:07.783
the screening room

15:05.614 --> 15:07.783
from now on,

15:07.825 --> 15:09.326
- if you stop
- messing with us.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.178
- BERTRAM: You just have to
- sign a peace treaty

15:11.202 --> 15:12.513
- That we've put out
- on the terrace.

15:12.537 --> 15:13.789
Never!

15:13.831 --> 15:15.290
I set up a buffet.

15:15.332 --> 15:17.125
- Dude, why didn't you
- just lead with that?

15:25.342 --> 15:29.513
Hey, it's cold out here!

15:29.554 --> 15:31.682
I built you a fire,

15:31.723 --> 15:32.516
- but that was mostly
- so you couldn't

15:31.723 --> 15:32.723
Crawl back through.

15:34.017 --> 15:36.186
(BOTH LAUGHING)

15:38.229 --> 15:39.314
(EXCLAIMING IN SURPRISE)

15:43.026 --> 15:44.444
Ow! You're crushing me!

15:46.697 --> 15:49.117
We knew you'd head

15:49.118 --> 15:51.535
towards the screening room,

15:46.697 --> 15:51.535
right into our booby-trap!

15:51.576 --> 15:53.161
Who are the idiots now?

15:55.038 --> 15:57.248
Uh, I think it is a tie.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.480
Because now

15:58.481 --> 15:59.668
there is no one

15:57.290 --> 15:59.668
to let us back in!

15:59.710 --> 16:01.546
And I am colder than

16:01.547 --> 16:03.380
a Himalayan mountain

15:59.710 --> 16:03.380
goat's tootsies.

16:04.047 --> 16:06.966
Me, too.

16:07.008 --> 16:08.695
- But the sight of - Bertram's butt in
- Emma's face

16:08.719 --> 16:10.303
- Makes me feel all
- warm and fuzzy.

16:14.766 --> 16:16.226
- Oh! Oh, Tony,
- this is great!

16:16.267 --> 16:18.228
Very family friendly.

16:18.269 --> 16:19.646
Not romantic at all.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.379
Tony, is this you

16:23.380 --> 16:25.151
opening the door?

16:25.193 --> 16:26.695
Yep, this is where

16:26.696 --> 16:28.196
I got my start.

16:28.238 --> 16:29.989
- I still got those
- training epaulets.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.368
Maybe someday

16:33.369 --> 16:34.619
I'll pass them on

16:32.116 --> 16:34.619
to my son.

16:36.204 --> 16:38.081
- Okey-dokey.
- Let's get our grub on!

16:39.958 --> 16:42.085
There's my bambino!

16:42.126 --> 16:43.503
Hey!

16:48.174 --> 16:50.301
You must be Jessie.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.987
- I'm Carmella. - And this is my
- Husband, Angelo.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.284
But when you're here,

16:53.285 --> 16:54.556
call us Mama and Papa.

16:54.598 --> 16:56.057
It'll be fun!

16:56.099 --> 16:57.601
- (CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)
- So fun!

16:58.351 --> 16:59.644
- Ah!
- Ah!

16:59.686 --> 17:00.896
Ah!

17:06.233 --> 17:07.944
Ow!

17:07.986 --> 17:09.069
Totally worth it.

17:11.281 --> 17:12.782
(ALL CHUCKLING)

17:16.327 --> 17:17.913
- Tony, is this
- your grandfather?

17:18.663 --> 17:20.205
Nope.

17:20.248 --> 17:21.449
- Never seen
- that guy before.

17:22.917 --> 17:24.159
- Come on, let's eat.
- Come on.

17:30.341 --> 17:33.177
Those are all relatives.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.243
It's a Chicolini family

17:35.244 --> 17:37.265
tradition to propose

17:33.219 --> 17:37.265
in this restaurant.

17:37.307 --> 17:38.475
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

17:38.476 --> 17:39.643
Really?

17:39.684 --> 17:42.208
My family has a tradition

17:42.209 --> 17:44.731
to never accept a proposal

17:39.684 --> 17:44.731
in an Italian restaurant.

17:46.817 --> 17:47.897
That's a weird coincidence.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.823
Lean!

17:55.408 --> 17:56.608
- A little harder.
- (GRUNTING)

17:57.995 --> 17:59.120
I got it!

17:59.162 --> 18:01.039
- Okay, great.
- Now cut us down!

18:02.123 --> 18:03.291
With cheese?

18:06.003 --> 18:07.838
- You were supposed
- to grab the scissors!

18:09.547 --> 18:10.570
Sorry. I figured we'd

18:10.571 --> 18:11.591
be here a while.

18:14.302 --> 18:16.054
Jessie,

18:16.055 --> 18:17.806
someone really wants

18:14.302 --> 18:17.806
to meet you.

18:17.848 --> 18:19.517
This is

18:19.518 --> 18:21.184
Tony's grandmother, Elda.

18:21.225 --> 18:22.946
- (WITH MOUTH FULL)
- Very nice to meet you.

18:24.021 --> 18:26.064
(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)

18:26.105 --> 18:27.500
- Elda says you eat
- like a toddler,

18:27.524 --> 18:29.244
- But she's willing to
- overlook it because

18:29.275 --> 18:31.235
- You have excellent
- child-bearing hips.

18:31.277 --> 18:32.403
Check!

18:33.446 --> 18:35.824
Will you all excuse us?

18:35.866 --> 18:37.301
- Zuri and I need to
- use the ladies' room.

18:37.325 --> 18:38.368
But I don't

18:38.369 --> 18:39.410
have to go...

18:39.452 --> 18:40.763
- Well, then, - why don't you
- Wash your hands.

18:40.787 --> 18:41.663
- You've been eating
- that greasy squid!

18:41.705 --> 18:42.705
That was squid?

18:46.292 --> 18:48.252
- Listen, Zuri. - We have to
- Get out of here

18:48.294 --> 18:49.522
- Before Tony - has a chance
- To propose!

18:49.546 --> 18:51.048
- Can you pretend
- to be sick?

18:51.089 --> 18:52.424
Being out with Stuart,

18:52.425 --> 18:53.758
I won't need to pretend.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.561
- I've been holding back
- my barf all night.

18:56.970 --> 18:58.200
Good. I might ask

18:58.201 --> 18:59.430
you to let it rip.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.372
Hey, guys, bad news.

19:03.373 --> 19:04.602
Zuri isn't feeling too...

19:04.644 --> 19:05.979
(GASPS)

19:05.980 --> 19:07.313
Ooh! Tiramisu!

19:07.355 --> 19:08.690
- Hand me
- a big girl fork!

19:11.442 --> 19:13.486
(WHIMPERING)

19:13.528 --> 19:15.092
Ravi, if you really

19:15.093 --> 19:16.656
have to pee that bad,

19:13.528 --> 19:16.656
just go in the plant.

19:18.366 --> 19:19.617
Forgive me, ficus!

19:21.745 --> 19:23.080
(ZIPPER UNZIPS)

19:23.121 --> 19:23.788
RAVI: Ah!

19:23.830 --> 19:25.707
(SCREAMS)

19:25.749 --> 19:27.125
Oh, and don't aim

19:27.126 --> 19:28.501
into the wind.

19:29.377 --> 19:30.377
RAVI: Now you tell me.

19:33.131 --> 19:34.734
- Okay, guys, - finish up
- Your desserts.

19:34.758 --> 19:36.151
- We really should be
- going before...

19:36.175 --> 19:38.449
No, no, no,

19:38.450 --> 19:40.722
no, no, no!

19:40.764 --> 19:41.869
Hey, where'd this ring

19:41.870 --> 19:42.974
come from?

19:43.016 --> 19:44.475
Tony, don't be coy!

19:44.517 --> 19:46.562
Look, you are amazing,

19:46.563 --> 19:48.605
and I really like you,

19:48.646 --> 19:49.731
but if you think this

19:49.732 --> 19:50.815
is happening,

19:50.857 --> 19:53.878
- you're a few meatballs - short of a
Chicolini - Bottomless Spaghetti Plate!

19:53.902 --> 19:55.570
What are you saying?

19:55.612 --> 19:57.172
- Maybe I can shed - some light on this
- Situation...

19:57.196 --> 19:58.489
- Not now, Stuart!
- Okay.

20:00.658 --> 20:01.659
Tony, what I'm saying

20:01.660 --> 20:02.660
is that

20:02.702 --> 20:04.829
I am extremely flattered,

20:04.871 --> 20:06.039
but, no,

20:06.040 --> 20:07.206
my answer is no.

20:07.248 --> 20:08.750
I cannot marry you, Tony.

20:08.792 --> 20:10.293
What?

20:10.334 --> 20:11.604
- Jessie, I really think
- you want to hear that...

20:11.628 --> 20:12.754
- Stuart!
- Grown-up talk!

20:14.131 --> 20:15.131
But that's my ring!

20:15.924 --> 20:17.634
Zuri's ring, actually.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.222
It's a promise ring

20:22.223 --> 20:23.389
I got for you.

20:23.431 --> 20:25.809
Aww, Stuart...

20:25.850 --> 20:27.332
Okay, I'll take the ring,

20:27.333 --> 20:28.812
but I'm not

20:25.850 --> 20:28.812
promising anything.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.191
- You thought I
- was proposing?

20:33.232 --> 20:34.567
Of course!

20:34.568 --> 20:35.902
You said this would be

20:33.232 --> 20:35.902
"a night to remember."

20:35.944 --> 20:37.905
- Sure, because I knew
- we could get a free meal!

20:39.656 --> 20:41.449
- And you wanted to
- share your apartment!

20:41.491 --> 20:43.284
It's 2,000 bucks a month!

20:43.326 --> 20:44.369
I'm gonna split it

20:44.370 --> 20:45.411
with my cousin,

20:43.326 --> 20:45.411
Dominic!

20:48.456 --> 20:50.709
He has

20:50.710 --> 20:52.961
more square footage

20:48.456 --> 20:52.961
than your apartment.

20:53.003 --> 20:54.713
Listen, Jessie,

20:54.714 --> 20:56.422
you're the greatest

20:53.003 --> 20:56.422
girl ever,

20:56.464 --> 20:58.154
but I don't want to get

20:58.155 --> 20:59.843
married for years and

20:56.464 --> 20:59.843
years and years and...

20:59.884 --> 21:00.884
Whoa!

21:01.886 --> 21:04.055
Let me get this straight.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.516
I'm just supposed to

21:05.517 --> 21:06.933
just wait around

21:04.097 --> 21:06.933
in my Tessie T-shirt

21:06.975 --> 21:08.205
for years and years

21:08.206 --> 21:09.435
and years,

21:09.477 --> 21:10.624
until you are ready to

21:10.625 --> 21:11.771
make a commitment?

21:11.813 --> 21:13.614
- Quick. - Get all the knives
- Off the table.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.195
You guys heard all that?

21:18.236 --> 21:19.445
All of Brooklyn heard it.

21:19.487 --> 21:20.947
Elda's webcasting it.

21:26.744 --> 21:27.788
I still can't believe

21:27.789 --> 21:28.830
I did that.

21:31.457 --> 21:32.604
I can't imagine

21:32.605 --> 21:33.751
what Tony must be

21:31.457 --> 21:33.751
thinking.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.729
- He's probably thinking - how he's
gonna get his - Cousin Dominic

21:35.753 --> 21:37.964
Up four flights of stairs.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.551
- I am having
- the worst night ever!

21:44.512 --> 21:45.513
(SCOFFS IN DISBELIEF)

21:49.642 --> 21:50.894
Maybe the second worst.

21:52.103 --> 21:53.251
Help us!

21:53.252 --> 21:54.397
Let us in!

21:54.438 --> 21:55.481
Cut us down!

21:55.523 --> 21:56.837
I really need

21:56.838 --> 21:58.151
to wash my hands!

22:01.154 --> 22:02.488
- Do you know
- what this means?

22:02.530 --> 22:04.032
- We're surrounded
- by nitwits?

22:06.034 --> 22:07.765
Yes, but also,

22:07.766 --> 22:09.495
the screening room

22:06.034 --> 22:09.495
is free!

22:09.537 --> 22:11.497
- I can finally watch
- that Channing Tatum movie!

22:14.959 --> 22:16.377
(TEETH CHATTERING)

22:20.757 --> 22:22.717
Thank you.

22:22.759 --> 22:24.261
- EMMA:
- Zuri, hurry.

22:26.888 --> 22:28.890
Sit tight.

22:28.932 --> 22:30.659
- It takes me an hour - to cut a
piece of paper - With these babies,

22:30.683 --> 22:32.685
So this could take a while.
