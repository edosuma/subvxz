And I'm always teasing him by pretending
to see the monsters everywhere.

17:51.100 --> 17:53.400
a lovely house.

17:53.400 --> 17:57.800
Lucy?
Offer Mr. Mortman a meatball.

18:05.067 --> 18:07.467
Mmm. Delicious.

18:07.467 --> 18:11.400
Mm-hmm.
What's for dinner?

18:12.400 --> 18:16.400
Well, it was going
to be a surprise, but--

18:16.400 --> 18:19.167
Since you asked, you are.

18:19.667 --> 18:23.233
[ Coughs ] Excuse me.
I thought you said--

18:23.733 --> 18:28.267
That's right. You.
You are.

18:28.267 --> 18:30.700
[ Hissing ]

18:30.700 --> 18:32.567
[ Screeches ]

18:53.267 --> 18:55.767
[ Hissing ]

18:56.767 --> 18:58.667
[ Dad]
Now that was a close call.

18:58.667 --> 19:01.567
[ Sighs ]

19:02.000 --> 19:04.267
Now listen, both of you.

19:04.267 --> 19:08.767
You can never, ever
let anyone know...

19:08.767 --> 19:11.200
that we are monsters.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.633
We know that.

19:14.133 --> 19:18.133
And we can't have any other
monsters in town either.

19:18.133 --> 19:20.833
- [ Hisses ]
- And do you know why?

19:20.833 --> 19:23.433
Because they might tell
other people about us.

19:23.433 --> 19:26.700
And they'd be frightened,
and they'd chase us away.

19:26.700 --> 19:28.700
Or worse.

19:31.200 --> 19:34.867
Mr. Mortman's the first monster
to come around in 20 years.

19:34.867 --> 19:36.700
Besides us, of course.

19:36.700 --> 19:39.500
That's why it took us
so long to believe you, Lucy.

19:39.500 --> 19:43.767
And when you two get bigger,
you're gonna get your training fangs.

19:43.767 --> 19:48.633
That's right. Before long, you and
Randy will be able to transform...

19:48.633 --> 19:51.167
just like your father and me.

19:51.167 --> 19:53.100
[ Clattering ]

19:53.100 --> 19:56.567
[ Randy ]
Oh, no! Another one!

19:56.567 --> 20:00.300
- [ Mom ] Not another Mortman.
- What are we gonna do?

20:00.800 --> 20:03.533
Better let him in.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.333
- [ Mom Snarling ]
- [ Hissing ]

20:10.333 --> 20:13.300
Hey, what's up?

20:13.300 --> 20:16.200
Just finished dinner.

20:16.667 --> 20:19.667
[ Aaron ]
Aw, man. Talk about timing.

20:19.667 --> 20:21.600
Well, what's for dessert?

20:21.600 --> 20:25.700
Well, it was going
to be a surprise, but...

20:26.133 --> 20:27.733
since you asked.

20:27.733 --> 20:29.633
You...

20:29.633 --> 20:31.967
like cherry pie?

20:31.967 --> 20:34.100
Sure.

20:39.900 --> 20:41.433
[ Belches ]

20:42.067 --> 20:44.500
Pardon me.
