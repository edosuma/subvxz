01:10.195 --> 01:11.696
What are you playing at?

01:12.822 --> 01:15.241
What is that you're trying to achieve?

01:25.585 --> 01:27.295
Why are you so scared of me?

01:28.379 --> 01:31.633
Did something happen between us?

01:40.433 --> 01:42.477
Stop dodging my questions. Just tell me.

01:43.269 --> 01:44.771
So I can be careful around you.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.026
Mr. Seo.

02:01.663 --> 02:02.956
Fancy seeing you here.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.334
Hello.

02:07.377 --> 02:08.670
What brings you here?

02:15.927 --> 02:20.640
TAERIM FOUNDATION'S FAMILY DAY,
EMPLOYEES' FAMILIES ARE INVITED

02:22.058 --> 02:25.311
<i>I wanted to see if I liked baseball.</i>

02:25.395 --> 02:27.397
PROGRAM
EXHIBITION BASEBALL MATCH WITH KIDS

02:31.025 --> 02:33.194
I saw the poster at the hospital.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.989
I noticed it was happening today
and was nearby, so…

02:37.574 --> 02:39.367
But I didn't know you were here.

02:43.371 --> 02:46.332
Dad, play catch with me.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.376
Play catch with me.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.753
Sure. Let's go.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.558
-Is this comfortable?
-Yes.

03:06.769 --> 03:08.229
Let's play catch. Let's go.

03:10.565 --> 03:11.441
Okay. Go ahead.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.821
So you happened
to see the poster and came here?

03:16.905 --> 03:17.739
There you go.

03:20.241 --> 03:21.075
Yes.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.871
-I thought I did.
-You're only throwing strikes.

03:26.873 --> 03:27.957
I wonder

03:29.208 --> 03:31.169
if I really came here because of baseball.

03:33.838 --> 03:37.175
Ho-su, where did you learn to do this?

03:37.258 --> 03:39.427
-You!
-You got it from me?

03:45.308 --> 03:46.809
All right. Throw it to Mom!

03:47.477 --> 03:50.563
-I don't know if I can catch it!
-Throw it to Mom!

03:51.064 --> 03:51.940
Dad, catch!

03:55.485 --> 03:56.319
-Mom.
-Yes?

03:56.402 --> 03:57.570
-Higher.
-Catch it.

03:57.654 --> 03:58.655
Mom!

04:00.949 --> 04:02.408
Ho-su, I'll throw it high.

04:09.207 --> 04:14.212
EPISODE 7
IF LOVE IS THE BEGINNING OF MISFORTUNE

04:24.931 --> 04:26.057
All right. Come in.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.730
The order of events will
be identical to that of Mass.

04:32.814 --> 04:36.442
After my sermon,
your wedding will take place.

04:37.026 --> 04:39.946
I will approach the bride and groom
after my sermon.

04:40.029 --> 04:42.323
Then the bride can put
the bouquet on the table,

04:43.116 --> 04:45.952
and both of you can take off your gloves.

04:46.577 --> 04:50.290
That's when I need a witness each
from both of you to step forward…

04:50.373 --> 04:52.875
<i>Ms. Gu, is it true that you were fired?</i>

04:52.959 --> 04:55.378
<i>When are you coming today?</i>

04:56.754 --> 04:58.631
<i>Filming without consent is illegal.</i>

04:59.132 --> 05:00.800
<i>And so is doing it for someone else.</i>

05:01.676 --> 05:05.013
<i>Do you think you'll be special to her
if you do what she tells you to do?</i>

05:05.096 --> 05:07.557
<i>No. If you were special to her,</i>

05:07.640 --> 05:10.226
<i>she wouldn't have let you commit a crime.</i>

05:13.980 --> 05:16.816
Don't let those who don't care
about you take advantage of you.

05:17.984 --> 05:21.612
You should start identifying
those who are giving you a chance

05:22.196 --> 05:23.948
<i>and helping you…</i>

05:26.993 --> 05:28.703
Everything she said is true.

05:29.203 --> 05:31.456
It's good advice
from a successful painter.

05:32.081 --> 05:32.957
What?

05:33.541 --> 05:38.796
But people like her who can afford failure
shouldn't give out such advice.

05:40.256 --> 05:41.424
Don't you see?

05:41.507 --> 05:44.761
People like us won't get
another chance if we mess up once.

05:44.844 --> 05:48.598
Is it so wrong to be a bit sly
to get what we want?

05:51.851 --> 05:52.685
You can.

05:54.604 --> 05:58.107
Right. Li-sa acted
totally nuts at the exhibition.

05:59.358 --> 06:03.321
She kept being rude to that sculptor
and threw a fit at her mom.

06:05.573 --> 06:09.118
Li-sa's mother came with you guys?

06:09.202 --> 06:10.203
Yes.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.705
Ms. Gu. I can make drinks now.

06:13.289 --> 06:14.499
Wait here.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.885
Why are you leaving?
Aren't you here to see Ju-yeong?

06:31.599 --> 06:32.725
That's fattening.

06:34.602 --> 06:36.562
Did you not come in because of me?

06:36.646 --> 06:39.524
I came because I couldn't reach her.
What is this? So annoying.

06:39.607 --> 06:42.151
That's not the right word.
You're disappointed.

06:45.530 --> 06:49.033
If you are curious about someone,
it means you are interested.

06:49.117 --> 06:52.328
And if you are annoyed because
she won't reciprocate your interest,

06:52.411 --> 06:53.955
you must be sad and disappointed.

06:54.038 --> 06:57.333
You're full of crap.
You're totally off base here.

06:57.416 --> 07:01.546
I just thought that
you should face your feelings as they are.

07:04.465 --> 07:06.342
Did you enjoy the exhibition with her?

07:06.425 --> 07:07.677
Why did you invite me?

07:08.594 --> 07:10.138
The sculptor is my husband.

07:11.806 --> 07:12.807
You're married?

07:14.016 --> 07:15.518
Why did you pretend to be single?

07:16.102 --> 07:17.770
I did no such thing.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.772
Did it seem so because we were apart?

07:19.856 --> 07:21.023
Why?

07:24.694 --> 07:26.112
He fell in love

07:26.988 --> 07:28.698
with someone else for a while.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.201
There it is. See you around.

08:01.689 --> 08:03.983
Seeing how you watched
the game until the end,

08:05.443 --> 08:06.903
you must've liked baseball.

08:08.779 --> 08:10.615
Right. I guess I did.

08:14.911 --> 08:16.996
-Bye, then.
-Get in, please.

08:17.705 --> 08:20.082
They're all leaving,
so it's hard to get a cab now.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.542
No. Thank you for the offer.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.461
Please get in. We have space.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.394
Any plans on having kids?

08:40.478 --> 08:41.979
You seem to like kids.

08:43.856 --> 08:47.109
I'm neither fit nor confident
to be a dad right now.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.861
No one feels ready to be a parent.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.947
You just do your best
with whatever you have.

08:52.156 --> 08:55.910
But I've never imagined
myself being a dad.

08:55.993 --> 08:58.621
Well, it isn't something
you can just imagine.

08:59.288 --> 09:01.374
Being everything to your kid.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.336
You can't give up
just because it gets hard.

09:05.419 --> 09:07.213
And giving up on them isn't right.

09:08.839 --> 09:12.843
On top of that, it's not something
other people can do for you. You know?

09:14.720 --> 09:17.598
Then I guess I'm not ready yet.

09:19.934 --> 09:23.854
Having someone whom I love more
than myself and must be responsible for…

09:25.815 --> 09:27.400
I'm not ready for that yet.

09:50.631 --> 09:51.674
What's wrong?

09:58.180 --> 09:59.140
Just go around her.

10:10.985 --> 10:12.153
Honey.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.697
Don't get out. It will just get worse.

10:16.324 --> 10:17.199
What is this?

10:17.283 --> 10:19.243
Get out, or your car will get dirty.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.126
Give me a minute, honey.

10:35.051 --> 10:37.553
Ms. Gu! What do you think
you are you doing?

10:40.097 --> 10:42.391
Honey, go check on Ho-su first.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.186
Honey.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.276
Come here, Ho-su.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.195
Hae-won!

11:06.207 --> 11:09.460
What scares you so much
to feel the need to go this far?

11:12.963 --> 11:14.423
-Let go.
-Stop.

11:14.507 --> 11:17.885
Let go. Let go of me!

11:17.968 --> 11:19.095
Let go!

11:19.178 --> 11:20.012
-Stop.
-Let go!

12:34.753 --> 12:38.382
<i>He fell in love
with someone else for a while.</i>

12:48.851 --> 12:49.935
Here we go.

12:51.061 --> 12:53.397
Hold on. Let's just take this off, Ho-su.

12:53.981 --> 12:55.024
Did you two fight?

12:56.025 --> 12:56.901
No.

12:56.984 --> 12:58.903
Then why bring your sleepy son here?

13:00.029 --> 13:02.448
Lie down. There you go.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.617
Grandma?

13:04.700 --> 13:08.370
My puppy. What did you do?
Why do you look so exhausted?

13:08.954 --> 13:11.832
I hit a home run today.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.459
Good boy.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.252
Dad…

13:16.754 --> 13:19.673
Mom smells sweet.

13:24.803 --> 13:25.930
He must've had a dream.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.391
Ho-su, you can sleep here
with your grandma today.

13:31.352 --> 13:35.606
I wonder why your mother smells sweet.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.860
She got mad

13:39.944 --> 13:42.279
at some man.

13:43.906 --> 13:47.660
So the dinosaur lady had a fight with her.

13:49.119 --> 13:50.329
Good night.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.013
You're not going to tell me?

14:08.097 --> 14:10.516
They gave me a ride with good intentions.

14:10.599 --> 14:14.019
With good intentions? They hate me.

14:14.853 --> 14:16.021
What good intentions?

14:16.105 --> 14:17.481
I ran into them.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.567
They had no ulterior motives.

14:19.650 --> 14:20.609
Exactly.

14:22.486 --> 14:23.821
Why do you keep running into them?

14:25.906 --> 14:26.991
That's even stranger.

14:27.074 --> 14:29.493
-Hae-won.
-Don't meet them when I'm not with you.

14:29.577 --> 14:32.162
She might say something
to make you hate me.

14:32.246 --> 14:33.747
What on earth…

14:34.999 --> 14:36.333
What's that look?

14:37.877 --> 14:39.003
You don't believe me?

14:39.086 --> 14:41.505
Why would I hate you
because of something they say?

14:43.048 --> 14:44.675
Are you sure you won't?

14:47.636 --> 14:51.098
I don't know why
we're arguing over someone else

14:52.641 --> 14:53.893
when we're doing fine.

14:56.896 --> 14:57.980
No.

14:58.772 --> 14:59.982
We're not fine.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.403
I'm just pretending to be okay.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.657
Honestly, I'm not okay at all.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.829
I bet you didn't know that.

15:16.206 --> 15:18.459
You don't even know
how I've been all these years.

15:20.669 --> 15:22.129
So how could it be okay?

15:47.237 --> 15:48.405
What are you doing here?

15:53.243 --> 15:55.537
Do you remember that guy
we met at the exhibition?

15:56.789 --> 15:57.623
What?

15:59.917 --> 16:01.710
You draw someone

16:02.795 --> 16:04.672
because you love them.

16:06.632 --> 16:07.716
That's what he said.

16:10.427 --> 16:11.887
It's getting late. Go to sleep.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.181
I don't have time to listen to you.

16:18.102 --> 16:20.270
-The heath…
-What?

16:22.564 --> 16:24.525
You know, the flowers.

16:25.359 --> 16:28.487
They were all over the hill
where you went to draw a long time ago.

16:28.570 --> 16:29.405
Do you remember?

16:41.291 --> 16:43.293
And I think I saw him there.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.132
What are you talking about?

16:49.216 --> 16:51.844
I remember seeing him there.

16:57.224 --> 16:59.226
How could you have seen him there?

17:00.561 --> 17:02.730
You were little.
You're remembering it wrong.

17:03.397 --> 17:05.816
No. I'm sure it was him there.

17:05.899 --> 17:06.734
That was your dad.

17:09.653 --> 17:11.947
Your dad was there with us.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.789
Then I should ask Dad.

18:09.588 --> 18:10.714
I had no idea.

18:15.010 --> 18:16.595
I'm sorry I didn't know.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.441
I'm sorry.

21:02.010 --> 21:06.056
Dad. When I went to see Mom with you
when I was little,

21:06.139 --> 21:07.349
those flowers there.

21:08.850 --> 21:11.561
-Flowers?
-Yes, what were they called?

21:14.564 --> 21:15.857
What flowers?

21:31.623 --> 21:33.709
She asked me that question before.
What flower?

21:50.309 --> 21:51.768
<i>Honestly, I'm not okay at all.</i>

21:52.894 --> 21:55.147
<i>You don't even know
how I've been all these years.</i>

22:43.361 --> 22:45.947
Did you meet my daughter Li-sa?

22:47.074 --> 22:48.033
Pardon?

22:51.369 --> 22:53.330
POSTS
120 LIKES

22:54.122 --> 22:57.542
Right, I did.
I met her at your exhibition.

23:01.129 --> 23:02.631
What did you

23:03.882 --> 23:05.258
tell her?

23:07.803 --> 23:09.679
What nonsense did you tell her? She--

23:09.763 --> 23:12.265
It's cold. We can talk sitting.

23:17.979 --> 23:19.815
If you keep acting this way,

23:21.525 --> 23:25.362
it makes me think I was someone awful.
And that scares me.

23:27.280 --> 23:30.408
Hae-won told me that I used to hate you.

23:30.492 --> 23:32.702
I'm not here to talk about our past.

23:33.870 --> 23:35.956
-I think Li-sa--
-Heath.

23:40.544 --> 23:43.380
I only told her the name of the flower.

23:45.215 --> 23:48.593
As our meeting was brief,
nothing else happened.

23:51.138 --> 23:53.390
I understand why you are worried.

23:54.015 --> 23:58.478
I heard that Hae-won hurt your daughter
when she was her teacher.

24:00.272 --> 24:03.650
From now on, I will try
to be careful not to run into her…

24:05.485 --> 24:06.653
again.

24:12.325 --> 24:15.662
I would appreciate that.
And I apologize for barging in.

24:23.378 --> 24:25.672
It's true that you hated me.

24:26.923 --> 24:29.342
So I don't feel comfortable
around you either.

24:30.343 --> 24:33.555
But I think there's any need
to try to remember that.

24:35.807 --> 24:38.560
If you don't remember it,
then it's never happened.

24:49.946 --> 24:51.656
That was in the past.

24:51.740 --> 24:54.117
Even if I hated you in the past,

24:55.035 --> 24:56.578
I don't hate you now.

24:57.454 --> 24:59.122
Actually, I'm concerned about you.

25:00.290 --> 25:02.417
I know that it's my place
to worry about you.

25:03.418 --> 25:05.962
You look like you're being chased.
And that bothers me.

25:06.963 --> 25:08.256
That's all I feel now.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.885
Let go. You'll hurt your hand.

25:11.968 --> 25:14.137
I just wanted to tell you…

25:17.390 --> 25:18.725
not to worry.

25:36.243 --> 25:38.245
JEONG HUI-JU

25:51.341 --> 25:53.593
He's worried about me? How ridiculous.

25:58.848 --> 26:01.017
GU HAE-WON

26:01.101 --> 26:05.522
You'll be an intern for three months
and assist Mr. Seo as you learn the ropes.

26:11.111 --> 26:13.947
I know artists don't like
to be part of an agency

26:14.030 --> 26:16.032
because contracts make them
feel tied down.

26:16.116 --> 26:18.201
But to have a stable working environment,

26:18.285 --> 26:21.496
they definitely need
to be sponsored by the galleries.

26:21.579 --> 26:25.000
With these conditions, I don't think
Woo-jae will turn down your offer.

26:25.083 --> 26:28.295
He should work
on his next project right away.

26:28.378 --> 26:29.879
We must keep the momentum going.

26:31.298 --> 26:32.299
Okay.

26:33.967 --> 26:35.719
Mr. Seo told me that

26:35.802 --> 26:38.138
you were the rookie
everyone had their eyes on.

26:39.014 --> 26:40.557
Why did you stop drawing?

26:50.108 --> 26:52.652
I actually have

26:54.237 --> 26:56.489
a few of your early pieces.

26:57.907 --> 27:02.537
But the themes and style of your works
have changed a lot

27:03.246 --> 27:04.998
from back then.

27:08.668 --> 27:11.546
Was there any reason behind the changes?

27:13.256 --> 27:15.675
Well, artists are human after all.

27:15.759 --> 27:19.804
So the paintings are bound to change
based on the life of the artists.

27:19.888 --> 27:22.766
Since I find my inspiration around me,

27:22.849 --> 27:24.809
the changes would've been more noticeable.

27:27.354 --> 27:31.316
That must mean you've lived a good life.

27:33.401 --> 27:36.654
-Sir. Could I talk to you?
-Yes?

27:37.697 --> 27:38.740
Okay.

27:44.662 --> 27:46.581
Have you been living a good life then?

27:51.294 --> 27:54.589
I liked your early pieces more
because I could feel Woo-jae's influence.

27:55.965 --> 27:58.259
But your current paintings…

27:59.886 --> 28:01.054
They are suffocating.

28:02.722 --> 28:05.100
It's like you purposely
painted only pretty things.

28:08.186 --> 28:10.397
But I'm glad to see that you are happy…

28:12.482 --> 28:16.277
because you must not be lonely enough
to steal someone else's man again.

28:29.249 --> 28:33.753
When I saw this painting, the angle…

28:41.219 --> 28:43.096
You want me to work with Mr. Seo?

28:43.179 --> 28:45.348
There's a building
that will be demolished soon,

28:45.432 --> 28:49.394
that was designed by Asia's Best
Architect Award winner, Woo Jeong-hyo.

28:49.477 --> 28:51.479
So I'm thinking
of doing an exhibition there.

28:53.189 --> 28:55.734
I know that well-known artists like you

28:55.817 --> 28:58.153
prefer to work alone.

28:58.236 --> 29:00.655
So I'm asking you for a favor.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.949
For my gallery and Mr. Seo.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.619
I don't understand why I should.

29:06.703 --> 29:10.457
If this is because
I recruited your curator--

29:10.540 --> 29:14.586
My gallery was chosen
for next year's Art Basel.

29:15.920 --> 29:19.466
There's a special "unlimited" exhibition,
curated by the critics.

29:19.549 --> 29:22.093
I'm sure you know
that only two of galleries in Korea

29:22.177 --> 29:23.803
will have a chance to participate.

29:26.181 --> 29:27.599
An entry to Art Basel

29:27.682 --> 29:30.727
will be enough to attract attention
from the global market.

29:31.561 --> 29:34.522
And you might be the one
who gets that chance.

29:39.444 --> 29:42.781
<i>Opening a gallery itself is a gamble.</i>

29:43.364 --> 29:45.158
We're not some conglomerate.

29:45.241 --> 29:47.994
They are filthy-rich,
so a failed business won't hurt them.

29:49.746 --> 29:50.997
And look.

29:52.457 --> 29:53.917
Wasn't this an expansion job?

29:56.294 --> 29:57.754
Why does it cost this much?

29:58.797 --> 30:01.466
We reduced 20 percent
of the total construction cost.

30:02.091 --> 30:04.969
And we've already got 35 percent
of the budget from investments.

30:05.553 --> 30:07.680
You always do whatever you want.

30:07.764 --> 30:10.058
Why ask me
if you're not going to listen to me?

30:10.141 --> 30:12.185
Can you support Hui-ju on this?

30:12.268 --> 30:13.478
She needs to earn it.

30:13.561 --> 30:16.105
How can I support her
when she fights people?

30:16.773 --> 30:18.191
She didn't fight anyone.

30:18.274 --> 30:21.027
It was just a baseball game,
but it was a work event.

30:21.110 --> 30:22.487
How could she…

30:23.363 --> 30:24.948
Wait. Is this about that thing?

30:25.448 --> 30:27.492
I told you it wasn't what it looked like.

30:27.575 --> 30:29.744
I may disapprove of her,

30:30.286 --> 30:33.039
but I will not let you divorce her
because of your affair.

30:44.217 --> 30:46.344
Was Mr. Seo at the baseball game?

30:52.517 --> 30:55.395
I'm sorry I'm late. I thought
the meeting was happening now.

30:55.478 --> 30:57.772
You're not late. You're right on time.

30:58.439 --> 31:00.191
I want you to drive to Samin Hotel.

31:02.151 --> 31:03.695
Okay.

31:06.406 --> 31:08.992
So, about the gallery…

31:13.538 --> 31:14.789
What did you talk about?

31:14.873 --> 31:16.207
It was about the foundation.

31:18.251 --> 31:21.087
But she didn't invite me
and just wants to use me as a driver?

31:24.299 --> 31:25.633
Then you can

31:26.634 --> 31:27.927
update me later.

31:28.511 --> 31:29.470
Are you coming?

31:55.330 --> 31:58.249
PSYCHIATRIC COUNSELLING ROOM

31:58.333 --> 31:59.709
Hello.

32:01.628 --> 32:04.631
I'm sorry about yesterday. Hae-won--

32:04.714 --> 32:09.385
She must be very upset about her job.
Please comfort her.

32:09.469 --> 32:11.304
Thank you for understanding.

32:11.387 --> 32:14.599
I do understand,
but as you've seen yesterday,

32:14.682 --> 32:16.809
we're not very comfortable
around each other.

32:19.062 --> 32:21.314
I'd like for you to also move hospitals.

32:23.191 --> 32:25.526
-Hyeon-seong.
-Do you have time today?

32:25.610 --> 32:29.072
Let's eat dinner at our house.
Your sister wants to see you more often.

32:29.155 --> 32:31.366
-See you later.
-Okay.

32:35.703 --> 32:39.624
-I'll talk to him later--
-Ms. Jeong is your sister?

32:40.541 --> 32:42.710
Yes, she is.

32:46.172 --> 32:49.217
I see Dr. Choi is taking care of you.
Dr. Choi is great.

32:50.051 --> 32:54.263
Yes, an honest and good person.

32:54.889 --> 32:56.599
But progress is slow.

32:57.475 --> 33:01.145
-Since the problem is me.
-Gosh. Don't think of it like that.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.983
It could be better
only thinking of the present,

33:05.066 --> 33:07.527
than being stuck on the past.

33:08.111 --> 33:10.655
Ms. Jeong said something similar.

33:11.239 --> 33:12.198
Pardon?

33:12.281 --> 33:15.243
I'm not sure what is going on.

33:16.577 --> 33:19.247
Everything is jumbled up.

33:20.957 --> 33:25.837
Whenever you're confused, just think,
"The emotions I feel right now are real."

33:27.338 --> 33:30.675
And whatever it is that happened,
I'm against you moving hospitals.

33:34.679 --> 33:36.764
You see, I'm the best there is.

33:38.266 --> 33:39.642
Take care.

33:49.068 --> 33:51.904
I'll set up a meeting
with architect Woo Jeong-hyo soon.

33:51.988 --> 33:52.822
Okay.

33:56.451 --> 34:00.955
By the way,
Ms. Gu agreed to work at my gallery.

34:01.622 --> 34:03.124
She majored in art too.

34:03.207 --> 34:05.209
She has a great eye for interpreting art.

34:05.793 --> 34:07.545
I like that she respects artists too.

34:07.628 --> 34:11.841
Besides, I like having
happy couples around. It's therapeutic.

34:12.467 --> 34:15.553
I'm so happy to see
that Mr. Seo formed a happy family

34:15.636 --> 34:17.263
unlike his father.

34:17.972 --> 34:22.477
And it's ironic how a man like his father
raised such a loving person like him.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.896
I don't know much about him.

34:25.605 --> 34:28.232
But even if he wasn't
a good father to Mr. Seo,

34:28.316 --> 34:32.070
I'm sure he was the best father
to the artist within Mr. Seo.

34:33.571 --> 34:35.782
Not only did he pass down his talent,

34:35.865 --> 34:38.826
but also a sense of hunger
that couldn't be satiated.

34:40.369 --> 34:43.289
I'm sure Mr. Seo will prove his worth.

34:50.671 --> 34:52.256
I should be on my toes.

35:02.683 --> 35:05.103
Hey. How was work?

35:10.274 --> 35:12.568
Why did you send me
the money from your sale?

35:12.652 --> 35:15.321
I don't have anything to spend on.
You can spend it.

35:17.156 --> 35:20.409
I want you to do whatever you want
with that. That's my wish.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.204
I'll get you some tea.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.467
Let's have a wedding.

35:39.720 --> 35:42.181
We never had one.
We only registered our marriage.

35:43.641 --> 35:45.059
Let's use the money for that.

35:53.651 --> 35:55.736
We can invite a lot of people,

35:55.820 --> 35:58.114
take tons of photos,
and wear pretty clothes too.

36:00.032 --> 36:02.410
We're already married.

36:02.493 --> 36:05.872
Exactly. I want to show people
that we are married.

36:05.955 --> 36:07.582
I want everyone to know.

36:07.665 --> 36:09.542
We don't have anyone to invite.

36:10.334 --> 36:12.336
It's not like I have any other family.

36:13.045 --> 36:14.672
And I don't have any close friends.

36:14.755 --> 36:16.382
My family is your family.

36:16.465 --> 36:18.384
We have my grandpa and my mom.

36:18.467 --> 36:21.804
We can invite people from the gallery
and your recently-gained fans.

36:26.058 --> 36:27.810
You just have to say yes.

36:28.603 --> 36:29.562
I'll plan everything.

36:35.902 --> 36:37.862
You told me to do what I wanted with it.

36:39.572 --> 36:40.990
I want to be congratulated.

36:42.158 --> 36:43.910
I want people to congratulate us.

36:58.883 --> 37:01.135
Should we make our own invitations?

37:01.219 --> 37:02.929
It's been ages since I drew anything.

37:03.679 --> 37:07.099
When should we have the wedding?
Where should we have it?

37:07.183 --> 37:09.060
What do you think about the gallery?

37:12.313 --> 37:15.316
Goodness, Ho-su. The elephant's ears
are bigger than its trunk.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.526
Its name is Paka.

37:17.610 --> 37:20.613
Paka has big ears,
so he can even fly with them.

37:21.405 --> 37:23.574
Goodness. They can be wings too?

37:24.408 --> 37:26.035
This is super cool.

37:27.453 --> 37:29.288
Look. He should be an artist.

37:29.372 --> 37:30.998
He's talented, isn't he?

37:33.084 --> 37:35.127
Was Hui-ju also artistic
when she was young?

37:39.465 --> 37:41.217
I had never seen her draw as a kid.

37:42.426 --> 37:44.387
We were lucky to go to school.

37:44.929 --> 37:46.847
I'm really grateful to you

37:47.431 --> 37:49.767
for helping her follow her dream.

37:50.268 --> 37:53.312
I didn't help much.
Your sister is just talented.

37:57.483 --> 37:59.986
Goodness, Hui-ju. How long
have you been standing there?

38:01.487 --> 38:03.614
You should've told me
you were coming over.

38:03.698 --> 38:04.949
I invited him over.

38:05.491 --> 38:08.452
Every hospital is trying
to steal him from our hospital,

38:08.536 --> 38:10.079
so I'm trying to keep him at ours.

38:11.706 --> 38:13.749
You wanted to study
sports physical therapy.

38:13.833 --> 38:16.711
USC has a good residency program.

38:16.794 --> 38:20.089
Or you can go for a full-time
clinical internship in St. Louis.

38:21.007 --> 38:22.675
After you study there for two years,

38:22.758 --> 38:25.428
why don't you run your own center
within the hospital?

38:25.511 --> 38:27.388
Gosh. That's such a generous offer.

38:27.471 --> 38:31.058
He cares about you more than I do.
That's never crossed my mind.

38:35.479 --> 38:36.480
What about Li-sa?

38:36.564 --> 38:37.982
She's not home yet.

38:39.525 --> 38:41.193
I thought she already called you.

38:53.873 --> 38:56.042
What took you so long?
I texted you hours ago.

38:57.043 --> 38:58.711
I came as soon as my shift ended.

38:59.503 --> 39:00.796
I'm not going home today.

39:02.131 --> 39:03.382
I'll crash at your place.

39:04.967 --> 39:06.385
My dad is home.

39:06.469 --> 39:08.721
So what? I can sleep in your room.

39:57.728 --> 39:58.729
What's that for?

39:58.813 --> 40:01.023
Who knows what might be useful later?

40:01.107 --> 40:02.358
I'll film everything.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.282
-Did you pick one?
-Yes.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.877
She's blowing up your phone.

40:22.711 --> 40:24.296
You didn't tell her?

40:24.380 --> 40:27.550
Darn it. What about your mom?
Where is she?

40:28.134 --> 40:31.053
Who knows? She might be dead
on some alley for all I know.

40:33.180 --> 40:35.599
-Did they divorce?
-No.

40:37.810 --> 40:38.978
She just left.

40:40.271 --> 40:44.150
He keeps badmouthing her,
saying that she left for another man.

40:44.233 --> 40:45.317
But I totally get why.

40:47.778 --> 40:49.905
Would you want
to live with someone like him?

40:51.615 --> 40:54.118
In any case, she did abandon you.

40:54.201 --> 40:55.828
How can she like men over her kid?

40:57.079 --> 40:59.373
I like men who are nice to me.

41:00.166 --> 41:01.000
They are gross.

41:02.543 --> 41:05.171
Why are they gross?
You just haven't met the right person.

41:05.254 --> 41:06.422
You're full of it.

41:06.505 --> 41:08.340
-Then have you ever kissed anyone?
-Yes.

41:09.925 --> 41:11.177
Stop lying.

41:11.260 --> 41:12.845
When? Who? How?

41:18.309 --> 41:21.061
Like this. It's not a big deal.

41:24.857 --> 41:27.776
Come on! Get off me! You stupid.

41:27.860 --> 41:30.613
Don't mind him.
He falls back asleep after that.

41:30.696 --> 41:32.406
-Bring me more drinks.
-I'm leaving.

41:32.490 --> 41:33.741
You're not sleeping over?

41:33.824 --> 41:35.826
It's so loud. How can I sleep here?

41:35.910 --> 41:38.287
The path out of here is complicated.
Wait up!

41:44.543 --> 41:46.629
You should have called a cab to the house.

41:48.005 --> 41:49.882
I wanted to walk with you.

41:51.383 --> 41:54.094
Then you should visit more often.

41:55.804 --> 41:59.141
Well, I want to.

42:00.017 --> 42:03.312
But I don't feel like myself here.
I feel out of place.

42:06.690 --> 42:09.527
Hey. What happened yesterday?

42:10.736 --> 42:11.820
What do you mean?

42:11.904 --> 42:16.033
Hyeon-seong and Mr. Seo
ran into each other at the hospital.

42:17.826 --> 42:20.412
He asked Mr. Seo
to switch to another hospital.

42:22.081 --> 42:23.082
What?

42:24.708 --> 42:25.543
Why?

42:25.626 --> 42:27.711
Ms. Gu was mentioned,
so I think I know why,

42:27.795 --> 42:29.630
but it wasn't my place to ask.

42:41.392 --> 42:44.812
-That's my cab. I'll get going. Bye.
-Bye.

42:57.408 --> 43:00.744
<i>He asked Mr. Seo
to switch to another hospital.</i>

43:00.828 --> 43:02.830
<i>And I think I saw him there.</i>

43:18.762 --> 43:20.556
What are you thinking about?

43:24.810 --> 43:28.689
I'm trying to figure out
why I went to Ireland all of a sudden.

43:29.523 --> 43:30.524
Stuff like that.

43:32.526 --> 43:34.653
Well, it wasn't so sudden.

43:34.737 --> 43:36.614
You always wanted to go.

43:37.531 --> 43:39.325
Your favorite sculptor…

43:39.408 --> 43:40.492
Rowan Gillespie?

43:41.201 --> 43:42.202
Yes.

43:42.953 --> 43:44.788
-And the Cliffs…
-Cliffs of Moher.

43:45.789 --> 43:46.624
of Moher.

43:51.670 --> 43:53.922
Since we all die at some point,

43:55.049 --> 43:57.301
you wanted to die in a place like that.

44:02.348 --> 44:04.433
<i>So no one would know
if you were dead or alive</i>

44:05.768 --> 44:08.270
<i>because no one would find your body.</i>

44:32.503 --> 44:33.379
Hae-won!

44:36.715 --> 44:38.342
What was that? That was dangerous.

44:40.427 --> 44:42.304
I needed to believe.

44:45.265 --> 44:48.227
I needed to believe
that you wouldn't let me get hurt.

45:17.965 --> 45:20.801
I AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS BELOW,

EMBASSY OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

45:38.360 --> 45:41.989
HELLO, THIS IS THE EMBASSY
OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA IN IRELAND

45:47.286 --> 45:49.746
<i>Mr. Seo Woo-jae,
Korean police received a report</i>

45:49.830 --> 45:51.790
<i>that you had gone missing.</i>

45:51.874 --> 45:54.460
<i>We confirmed
that you departed for Ireland.</i>

45:54.543 --> 45:59.173
<i>So Interpol and our embassy
were requested to cooperate.</i>

46:04.720 --> 46:09.141
Yes. You were reported missing
on July 20th, 2014.

46:10.350 --> 46:15.063
The embassy located your whereabouts
after finding your travel logs to Ireland.

46:15.147 --> 46:17.191
And the missing person report
was cancelled at your request.

46:18.400 --> 46:20.486
Who first made the report?

46:20.569 --> 46:22.946
Gu Hae-won, your wife.

46:32.498 --> 46:34.166
<i>It's about Ms. Gu.</i>

46:34.249 --> 46:37.085
She quit. I thought
you were informed of it.

46:37.169 --> 46:39.630
I was wondering how exactly that happened.

46:39.713 --> 46:42.132
The disciplinary committee
decided to dismiss her.

46:42.216 --> 46:44.134
As there's much talk
about our high school,

46:44.218 --> 46:45.719
Mr. An didn't want any scandals.

46:45.802 --> 46:49.097
So he wrote a letter
of recommendation for Ms. Gu.

46:49.181 --> 46:50.724
And Ms. Gu won't

46:51.433 --> 46:53.936
be able to cause problems
regarding the incident.

46:54.019 --> 46:58.273
That means my husband
met up with her in private.

47:04.821 --> 47:07.908
I heard I would've died
if I was found any later.

47:07.991 --> 47:11.578
So I wanted to express my gratitude
to the man who saved me.

47:22.923 --> 47:24.216
Choi Jun-yeong?

47:24.758 --> 47:27.678
Yes. From what I heard,
he took me to the hospital

47:27.761 --> 47:32.266
and was the one who linked me
to Taerim Foundation for my medical bills.

47:32.349 --> 47:34.643
I was wondering if I could find this man.

47:37.396 --> 47:40.732
It is true that I donated some money
because my son was born there.

47:41.942 --> 47:44.361
But we only sponsor their social programs.

47:44.444 --> 47:46.113
We don't pick the recipient.

47:46.196 --> 47:51.326
It must have been the hospital's decision
who chose to sponsor you.

47:51.410 --> 47:54.955
I asked the hospital too.
But I was unable to get an answer.

47:57.541 --> 47:59.126
Leave the documents here.

47:59.209 --> 48:01.628
We'll look into it as much as we can.

48:02.337 --> 48:05.382
-Is that all?
-Yes. Thank you.

48:11.430 --> 48:12.806
Mr. Seo.

48:15.350 --> 48:18.645
Does Ms. Gu know
that you came here for this matter?

48:23.275 --> 48:25.444
Are you looking for a new hospital?
Or I can--

48:25.527 --> 48:28.280
No. I got much better at your hospital.

48:28.363 --> 48:30.324
And I can't easily get a new psychiatrist.

48:31.033 --> 48:32.784
Please be a bit more understanding.

48:42.127 --> 48:45.213
Sir, your wife was here just a moment ago.

48:46.673 --> 48:47.549
Just now?

48:48.717 --> 48:49.676
Where is she?

48:49.760 --> 48:52.304
She just left
when she knew you had a visitor.

48:52.387 --> 48:53.805
I saw her car leave.

48:56.099 --> 48:58.644
Tell Mr. Choi I want to see him here now.

48:58.727 --> 48:59.853
Yes, sir.

I'm almost there.

Hello. This is Gu Hae-won.

51:19.785 --> 51:21.703
Yes. Can we talk for a minute?

51:22.204 --> 51:24.664
It's about Ju-yeong's high school
admission counsel.

51:25.665 --> 51:27.667
Her father couldn't make it, right?

51:27.751 --> 51:29.795
I should have been there at least.

51:29.878 --> 51:32.547
But I didn't want
to run into Li-sa's mother…

51:34.716 --> 51:36.718
I see. She came.

51:39.930 --> 51:43.058
Right. Then some other time…

51:51.942 --> 51:55.320
GUIDE TO WEDDING MASS

51:58.114 --> 52:00.408
You should just
start coming to weekly service.

52:02.619 --> 52:04.120
Do you have a long lunch break?

52:04.621 --> 52:07.040
You work at the gallery now.
You came this far?

52:07.123 --> 52:10.710
I came here to see if I could do
something here, but they said no.

52:10.794 --> 52:12.712
If the church said no,

52:14.172 --> 52:15.423
maybe you shouldn't?

52:17.217 --> 52:18.343
You think so?

52:18.885 --> 52:22.430
Where's Mr. Seo? Why are you here alone?
And you've stopped getting treatment.

52:23.557 --> 52:24.558
I don't know.

52:26.810 --> 52:28.562
I wonder where he went.

52:56.798 --> 52:59.301
CONFESSIONAL

53:02.137 --> 53:04.472
I have to go out. I can't be in here.

53:06.683 --> 53:09.728
What does she have on you?
Why do you let her walk all over you?

53:15.233 --> 53:16.943
RITES OF CONFESSION

53:17.027 --> 53:19.029
This must be the confessing side.

53:20.864 --> 53:23.241
No. You should confess to a priest.

53:23.325 --> 53:25.911
This world is so unfair.

53:29.706 --> 53:30.916
So is love.

53:33.084 --> 53:35.670
It takes two people to fall in love.

53:36.630 --> 53:37.923
But when it ends,

53:38.965 --> 53:40.926
one of them can just easily walk away.

53:43.845 --> 53:47.390
And when the other one is in pain,
they're considered obsessive or clingy.

53:51.019 --> 53:52.562
I find that really unfair.

53:54.564 --> 53:57.567
-Hey…
-I wanted to have a wedding here.

53:59.527 --> 54:01.237
Breaking a promise made here would

54:01.821 --> 54:03.990
make you feel like
you'd really be punished.

54:08.620 --> 54:10.038
But they said no.

54:12.916 --> 54:16.795
There are so many restrictions.
I thought God was supposed to be generous.

54:16.878 --> 54:18.838
Well, what about Mr. Seo?

54:19.631 --> 54:21.466
Only one of you needs to be a believer.

54:21.549 --> 54:24.219
Or what about your parents?

54:24.302 --> 54:27.931
It might not be enough for a nuptial Mass,
but you can at least rent the church.

54:29.057 --> 54:32.519
Thanks for trying
to listen to my useless crap.

54:34.104 --> 54:36.314
I won't bother you anymore.

54:36.398 --> 54:37.607
I never thought

54:39.150 --> 54:40.318
it was useless.

54:40.902 --> 54:42.195
And you're not bothering me.

54:43.113 --> 54:45.073
When I'm alone,

54:45.156 --> 54:48.660
I often think
about the things you tell me.

54:51.997 --> 54:54.165
Why are you so kind?

54:55.250 --> 54:58.253
It must be taxing
to always be the good guy.

55:19.190 --> 55:22.110
GUIDE TO WEDDING MASS

55:27.490 --> 55:28.992
I thought I made myself clear.

55:32.495 --> 55:34.581
You two must have gotten close already.

55:41.921 --> 55:43.006
That woman…

55:48.178 --> 55:50.180
Does she know you're a murderer?

56:06.154 --> 56:07.822
Where have you been all day?

56:09.741 --> 56:11.951
Where else? I was in my studio.

56:13.411 --> 56:14.913
Why didn't you answer your phone?

56:16.915 --> 56:19.709
I just missed your call. So I called back.

56:29.677 --> 56:30.512
What's wrong?

56:31.346 --> 56:32.388
Hae-won.

56:37.143 --> 56:38.645
Did I

56:39.562 --> 56:40.855
run away from you?

56:43.149 --> 56:46.444
I was reported missing.
And you were the one who reported it.

56:48.780 --> 56:52.367
Did I really disappear on you
without giving you an explanation?

56:55.537 --> 56:56.496
Why did I?

57:05.880 --> 57:07.340
I'd like to know too.

57:10.468 --> 57:13.138
You said you would tell me
everything once you came back.

57:13.221 --> 57:15.014
So I waited, but you never came back.

57:19.352 --> 57:21.604
Waiting for you was so hard.

57:23.106 --> 57:26.192
So there was a point
when I wished you'd had an accident.

57:28.903 --> 57:30.655
If you were dead…

57:34.325 --> 57:38.580
It wouldn't have been as painful.
I could have just mourned for you.

57:42.667 --> 57:44.627
But it turned out you were in an accident.

57:48.214 --> 57:50.550
And you showed up
in front of me as a different man.

57:53.678 --> 57:55.138
So I can't even resent you.

57:56.431 --> 57:57.640
How irresponsible of you.

58:01.978 --> 58:04.814
You may have come back,
but I'm still waiting

58:05.773 --> 58:07.567
for you to explain everything.

58:20.038 --> 58:22.540
When will you get your memories back?

58:23.791 --> 58:25.043
What did your doctor say?

58:26.461 --> 58:27.962
I'll go with you next time.

58:44.729 --> 58:48.358
I think you should visit
the architect's studio at least once.

58:48.441 --> 58:50.818
-Let's see when you're all available.
-Okay.

59:01.663 --> 59:03.414
Artist Choi is here for you.

59:03.498 --> 59:04.624
Is it already time?

59:05.917 --> 59:08.628
Woo Jeong-hyo isn't available today.

59:08.711 --> 59:10.713
So you can all meet next week at the site.

59:14.759 --> 59:18.471
Ms. Lee. I wanted to ask you something.

59:20.223 --> 59:22.725
Woo-jae and I never had our wedding.

59:23.393 --> 59:25.311
So we want to hold a wedding soon.

59:26.187 --> 59:28.481
A wedding? When?

59:28.565 --> 59:30.066
We haven't set the date yet.

59:30.149 --> 59:34.070
We don't have a lot of guests to invite.
So it's iffy to rent a venue.

59:34.153 --> 59:35.572
That brings me to my question.

59:35.655 --> 59:38.491
Could we rent your gallery
just for one day?

59:39.075 --> 59:41.995
Of course, as long as the schedule allows.

59:42.078 --> 59:43.663
You can discuss it with my staff.

59:44.247 --> 59:46.457
-Excuse me. I have another meeting.
-Bye.

59:47.667 --> 59:48.793
Thank you.

1:00:02.599 --> 1:00:03.850
Congratulations.

1:00:05.310 --> 1:00:07.270
I hope you will be happy this time.

1:00:08.771 --> 1:00:10.273
Why did you say that?

1:00:11.858 --> 1:00:13.443
You want us to be happy this time?

1:00:14.277 --> 1:00:16.446
Then were we unhappy before?

1:00:35.506 --> 1:00:39.427
MOM

1:00:43.848 --> 1:00:46.100
You can't drive right now.
Pull over. I'll drive.

1:00:46.184 --> 1:00:48.394
My grandpa was hurt back then too.

1:00:48.478 --> 1:00:51.147
<i>That's how you started
teaching Hui-ju in my place.</i>

1:00:52.023 --> 1:00:53.316
This is awful.

1:00:53.399 --> 1:00:55.818
We don't know how he is yet.
I'm sure he's okay.

1:00:55.902 --> 1:00:57.195
No.

1:00:57.278 --> 1:00:59.030
<i>I'm not worried about my grandpa.</i>

1:00:59.614 --> 1:01:02.325
<i>It's awful that
I'm reminded of those days.</i>

1:01:19.008 --> 1:01:20.176
What's wrong?

1:01:20.259 --> 1:01:22.387
I heard you were sick!

1:01:23.304 --> 1:01:25.014
Those people at the health center.

1:01:25.098 --> 1:01:27.517
They always call my family.

1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:30.103
I can't even get my medicine
without making you worry.

1:01:30.186 --> 1:01:31.771
Did your mom make a fuss again?

1:01:32.897 --> 1:01:35.149
She's not even here. Why all the fuss…

1:01:44.826 --> 1:01:48.329
What are you doing? Come on. Stop.

1:01:48.413 --> 1:01:49.789
Stop it.

1:01:58.506 --> 1:01:59.590
An accident?

1:02:00.091 --> 1:02:01.759
How many times must I tell you?

1:02:02.844 --> 1:02:04.178
You were in an accident,

1:02:04.762 --> 1:02:08.015
so you were unconscious
in bed for all these years?

1:02:08.725 --> 1:02:09.809
I'm sorry.

1:02:11.853 --> 1:02:15.106
We'll have a wedding this time
even if it's small.

1:02:15.189 --> 1:02:16.607
Why should it be small?

1:02:17.150 --> 1:02:19.777
Throw a big one,
so everyone in our town can come.

1:02:20.987 --> 1:02:22.405
We'll go on our honeymoon too.

1:02:24.824 --> 1:02:26.576
Cat got your tongue?

1:02:27.201 --> 1:02:28.453
It's your wedding too.

1:02:31.080 --> 1:02:32.123
I'm sorry.

1:02:34.041 --> 1:02:35.918
Do you even make money?

1:02:53.144 --> 1:02:56.272
You're a real son of a bitch.

1:02:56.355 --> 1:02:58.065
Hell, I'd prefer a dog.

1:03:03.988 --> 1:03:06.115
Don't just stand there. Take this down.

1:03:06.199 --> 1:03:07.200
Yes, sir.

1:03:14.040 --> 1:03:18.961
If I ever hear my baby say
she doesn't want to live,

1:03:19.045 --> 1:03:21.422
I'll tear off your limbs and eat them.

1:03:27.637 --> 1:03:31.057
It seems like it might rain.

1:03:31.599 --> 1:03:32.767
Take these all down.

1:03:56.207 --> 1:03:58.668
We should head back, but I'm so sleepy.

1:04:05.550 --> 1:04:07.218
You've been exhausted all day.

1:04:08.261 --> 1:04:09.428
We'll sleep over.

1:04:10.054 --> 1:04:13.266
We didn't even bring your meds.

1:04:14.517 --> 1:04:15.601
Don't worry.

1:04:16.978 --> 1:04:19.063
No, we can't.

1:04:20.106 --> 1:04:23.234
We have to go plan the wedding.

1:04:26.112 --> 1:04:28.322
And our honeymoon too.

1:04:30.867 --> 1:04:32.743
Sure. Let's do that.

1:04:34.287 --> 1:04:36.289
Let's go to the Cliffs of Moher.

1:04:39.959 --> 1:04:40.835
Sure.

1:04:47.341 --> 1:04:49.468
I'm sure they will look so beautiful

1:04:51.012 --> 1:04:52.847
in person, right?

1:04:56.893 --> 1:04:59.186
When we look at something so beautiful,

1:05:00.146 --> 1:05:02.106
we'll want to live.

1:05:04.817 --> 1:05:05.776
Right.

1:05:12.033 --> 1:05:13.618
I'm curious.

1:05:16.871 --> 1:05:18.623
Standing way up there…

1:05:20.124 --> 1:05:22.835
who would you think of?

1:07:03.561 --> 1:07:04.895
<i>I'm curious.</i>

1:07:06.397 --> 1:07:07.898
<i>Standing way up there…</i>

1:07:09.900 --> 1:07:13.696
<i>who would you think of?</i>

1:09:17.570 --> 1:09:19.989
<i>There's not much else besides the wedding.</i>

1:09:20.072 --> 1:09:21.866
<i>Is it because of Woo-jae?</i>

1:09:21.949 --> 1:09:24.743
<i>Tell me, Woo-jae. Do you love me?</i>

1:09:24.827 --> 1:09:28.164
-I'm sorry.
-Don't apologize!

1:09:28.247 --> 1:09:31.584
<i>If you turn away from her again,
Hae-won will die.</i>

1:09:32.626 --> 1:09:34.420
<i>It's not like
accidents happen with a warning.</i>

1:09:34.920 --> 1:09:36.505
<i>I want to be like you, Hui-ju.</i>

1:09:36.589 --> 1:09:38.883
<i>I thought I ran away best I could.</i>

1:09:38.966 --> 1:09:41.510
Together with you holding my hand.

1:09:41.594 --> 1:09:43.804
<i>Even if that path is nothing
but a torturous hell,</i>

1:09:43.888 --> 1:09:47.933
<i>I vow to be with you together.</i>

1:09:49.518 --> 1:09:54.523
