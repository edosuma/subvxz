00:00.060 --> 00:01.680
Previously on
<i>Black Lightning...</i>

00:01.859 --> 00:06.400
She's here to realize her full
potential for the benefit of all of us.

00:06.480 --> 00:09.560
<i>Wendy could prove to be
more revolutionary</i>

00:09.570 --> 00:11.410
<i>than the tank or
the machine gun.</i>

00:11.480 --> 00:13.320
You let me in right now!

00:13.390 --> 00:17.280
She's powering up too fast!
Can't you all see that?

00:17.290 --> 00:20.620
Grace? Grace.
Are you in here?

00:23.400 --> 00:25.330
You should not have come here.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.500
I already know there's
meta-humans in the clinic.

00:27.570 --> 00:29.050
But no one but me
knows where they are.

00:30.670 --> 00:33.430
Those Leavenworth
subjects turned covert assets?

00:33.500 --> 00:34.910
They're the exact same people

00:34.990 --> 00:37.210
inside those pods we took
out of that clinic basement.

00:37.290 --> 00:39.510
So, who do we wake up first?

00:39.520 --> 00:42.940
Marcus Bishop.
He can control and emit vibrations.

00:46.180 --> 00:47.970
Jeff, the facility is under attack.

00:49.670 --> 00:51.520
How soon before all
my metas are at full strength?

00:51.600 --> 00:53.280
Four days if I push it.

00:53.360 --> 00:55.610
Since I'll be renting these super
freaks out to the highest bidder,

00:55.620 --> 00:56.860
the more there are,

00:56.940 --> 00:59.070
the merrier
my bank account will be.

00:59.150 --> 01:03.700
You're about to be the most powerful
meta-human arms dealer in the world.

01:03.780 --> 01:05.530
I'm gonna make him pay, Khalil.

01:05.610 --> 01:07.460
<i>I'm gonna put
Tobias Whale in the ground.</i>

01:07.540 --> 01:10.120
Revenge is not the right thing,
justice is.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.340
Revenge is justice.

01:15.620 --> 01:17.300
<i>Why won't you let me die?</i>

01:17.380 --> 01:19.850
Because you still have work to do yet.

Wait right there!

01:37.480 --> 01:38.860
Get on the ground, now!

01:38.940 --> 01:40.570
Put
your hands up! Hands up!

01:40.650 --> 01:42.280
Hey! Hey! Hey!
I'm on y'all's side!

01:42.360 --> 01:43.860
Don't shoot me!

01:43.940 --> 01:45.160
Get down on the ground!

01:45.170 --> 01:46.630
You gonna shoot me?

01:48.840 --> 01:50.500
I'm on y'all's side!

01:50.580 --> 01:52.210
What you doin'?

01:52.280 --> 01:54.000
Don't shoot me,
I'm on y'all's side!

01:54.010 --> 01:55.430
I'm tryin' to help you!
Don't shoot!

01:55.500 --> 01:57.210
Please, don't shoot!
Please don't...

02:02.130 --> 02:04.350
I love these potatoes.

02:04.430 --> 02:06.080
Jennifer made them.

02:06.080 --> 02:09.900
And she has promised to help
me prepare dinner twice a week.

02:10.380 --> 02:11.230
Huh?

02:13.480 --> 02:14.700
Well, these are delicious.

02:14.770 --> 02:16.030
Thanks.

02:17.650 --> 02:20.610
Yeah, I bought them...
at that new shop on Williams Street.

02:20.690 --> 02:22.080
I threw them in a pan
and heated them up.

02:24.450 --> 02:26.580
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.750
Everything okay, honey?

02:32.410 --> 02:33.790
Yeah, I think so.

02:35.290 --> 02:38.880
Look, it's not me, it's a friend, okay?
It'll be fine.

02:38.890 --> 02:43.510
So, a family meeting?
Seems very official.

02:43.580 --> 02:47.940
I just...
thought we needed to talk.

02:49.050 --> 02:50.600
I mean, a lot has happened.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.150
I mean, Khalil had...

02:57.310 --> 02:59.410
A new meta showed up in Freeland

02:59.480 --> 03:02.410
and helped kidnap
the vaccine kids.

03:02.490 --> 03:03.910
Now, look, I know

03:03.990 --> 03:06.910
that you are eager to
just jump into the fight.

03:06.920 --> 03:12.490
And I know that
you are eager to take revenge.

03:12.570 --> 03:14.250
And everything in my fatherly body

03:14.260 --> 03:16.760
wants to tell both of you
to stay out of it,

03:16.830 --> 03:20.260
but your mother
has helped me see

03:20.340 --> 03:22.970
that I need to father
in a different way.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.800
Go Mom.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.640
Your father wants to protect you.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.270
That's a good thing.

03:33.930 --> 03:37.190
But I need to be
able to trust you.

03:37.260 --> 03:41.730
Okay, I need to know that we are
all rowing in the same direction.

03:41.810 --> 03:43.570
So, I've come up with a code,

03:43.640 --> 03:46.450
three rules that we will follow.

03:46.530 --> 03:47.990
Rule number one.

03:48.060 --> 03:50.320
We don't tell anybody
who we are.

03:50.400 --> 03:51.490
Hmm.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.630
Well, that's for
you two blabbermouths.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.450
Mom and I are good
on that front.

03:55.460 --> 03:58.970
Rule number two.
You always have backup.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.180
Gambi counts?

04:00.750 --> 04:02.970
Gambi counts.

04:03.050 --> 04:05.380
Your mother and her best
friend "Shotgun" count.

04:09.940 --> 04:13.470
Hey, but no going it alone doing
anything power-related, okay?

04:13.550 --> 04:14.360
Okay.

04:14.860 --> 04:15.930
Mmm-hmm.

04:16.010 --> 04:17.190
Rule number three,

04:18.399 --> 04:20.480
we don't kill, ever.

04:20.490 --> 04:22.490
Uh-uh, Dad,
Tobias killed Khalil.

04:22.570 --> 04:24.500
And he tried to kill you.

04:24.580 --> 04:27.530
I have not forgotten anything that
Tobias has done to me, believe me.

04:27.540 --> 04:29.330
But killing him won't change
a damn thing.

04:29.410 --> 04:32.000
Okay, no telling folks,
no going all Robin Hood...

04:32.080 --> 04:33.240
I understand those.

04:33.320 --> 04:35.340
This doesn't make sense.
Tobias needs to go.

04:35.410 --> 04:38.510
- You know that. You know it.
- This is not open for discussion.

04:38.580 --> 04:40.510
If either one of you
doesn't go along,

04:40.580 --> 04:42.840
I will tell Gambi to lock up
your suit and throw away the key.

04:42.920 --> 04:44.790
Okay, whoa.
I am a grown woman, so...

04:44.870 --> 04:48.090
I can't... I can't keep you
from wearing a hoodie

04:48.170 --> 04:50.020
and going out stealing money
from gangsters,

04:50.090 --> 04:52.350
but I can keep you
from pretending

04:52.430 --> 04:55.650
that the suit gives you
license to make bad choices.

05:07.690 --> 05:09.700
Do you agree to these rules?

05:09.780 --> 05:11.580
- You mean your rules?
- And?

05:13.950 --> 05:16.920
Don't look at me.
You guys have to figure this out.

05:21.790 --> 05:22.920
Fine.

05:28.370 --> 05:29.515
Could you pass me the potatoes?

05:29.518 --> 05:30.664
Yeah.

05:33.210 --> 05:35.800
Damn it.

05:35.880 --> 05:38.070
- Can I borrow something?
- Yeah.

05:38.140 --> 05:39.940
Okay.

05:41.450 --> 05:43.950
- I need to clean it up.
- I got it. I got it.

06:13.510 --> 06:14.800
We're ready.

06:14.810 --> 06:16.270
Then wake them up.

06:18.800 --> 06:19.900
Three,

06:22.970 --> 06:24.190
two,

06:26.100 --> 06:26.860
one.

06:57.340 --> 06:59.510
Calm down, ladies.

07:16.570 --> 07:17.870
Let them up.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.520
Darryl.

07:44.050 --> 07:45.280
Joe.

07:50.270 --> 07:51.450
Rebecca.

07:52.700 --> 07:54.900
Kiss my ass.

07:54.910 --> 07:57.410
Hmm.

07:58.610 --> 08:00.450
I know this is disorienting.

08:00.530 --> 08:01.950
You've been in those
pods for 30 years

08:02.030 --> 08:03.540
and the world has changed.

08:03.620 --> 08:04.710
Who the hell are you?

08:06.700 --> 08:09.050
All you need to know
is that I am Tobias Whale.

08:09.130 --> 08:12.130
Tobias...
Tobias who?

08:12.200 --> 08:13.720
Your new boss.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.550
Now, sit your ass down

08:15.560 --> 08:17.630
while I educate you
on what's about to happen.

08:23.640 --> 08:25.900
Let's get started.

08:25.980 --> 08:28.270
<i>The rest of this
is just too graphic to show.</i>

08:28.340 --> 08:28.797
<i>Put your hands up!</i>

08:28.798 --> 08:30.733
<i>Bystanders say
the young man, affectionately...</i>

08:30.758 --> 08:32.433
<i>known as Cape Guy
in the neighborhood,</i>

08:32.480 --> 08:34.480
<i>was caught in a magnetic storm.</i>

08:34.559 --> 08:36.870
<i>Cape Guy wasn't
trying to hurt nobody.</i>

08:36.950 --> 08:39.250
<i>He was one of those
Green Light babies,</i>

08:39.320 --> 08:42.250
<i>I mean, high as a kite,
wanting to be a superhero.</i>

08:42.330 --> 08:45.250
<i>But all that metal flying around...</i>

08:45.330 --> 08:47.250
<i>I mean, he was more scared
than the police</i>

08:47.330 --> 08:49.580
<i>about everything
that was happening.</i>

08:49.660 --> 08:51.920
<i>A hero and veteran for
his country who suffered from PTSD.</i>

08:51.930 --> 08:54.170
<i>News sources reveal
that his wife believed</i>

08:54.250 --> 08:57.170
<i>that he may have been self-medicating
with the drug Green Light.</i>

08:57.250 --> 08:58.930
<i>And, while we haven't
been able to confirm</i>

08:59.010 --> 09:00.600
<i>that Cape Guy was
a Green Light meta,</i>

09:00.680 --> 09:02.840
<i>it is increasingly clear</i>

09:02.920 --> 09:06.390
<i>that Freeland police are now willing
to shoot first and find out later.</i>

09:06.470 --> 09:07.690
What a shame.

09:10.020 --> 09:11.950
It proves that Freeland
is a dangerous place

09:12.020 --> 09:13.660
for young people with powers.

09:16.160 --> 09:19.120
Did you get any leads
on the kidnapped vaccine kids?

09:19.200 --> 09:23.000
No, the trail has,
as they say, gone cold.

09:24.370 --> 09:25.880
How long can they live
without treatment?

09:26.960 --> 09:28.300
They were stable,

09:28.370 --> 09:30.410
I'm not sure how the move
might have affected them.

09:30.490 --> 09:32.220
I doubt
the kidnappers were careful.

09:33.490 --> 09:34.580
They might all be dead.

09:34.660 --> 09:35.680
Hmm.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.510
That would be a shame, too.

09:48.820 --> 09:50.570
How are they?

09:50.640 --> 09:53.440
Dr. Stewart did a
wonderful job of taking care of them.

09:53.510 --> 09:56.030
They're actually better than
they've ever been before.

09:56.570 --> 09:58.260
Good.

09:58.260 --> 10:00.990
How long until they can be
awakened and join the prison metas?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.240
A week or two.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.570
What then?

10:04.650 --> 10:09.240
My army of metas will make me richer
and more powerful than I ever dreamed.

10:09.320 --> 10:11.670
And I plan to cram my victory
down the throats of everyone

10:11.750 --> 10:14.050
who tried to stand in my way.

10:18.590 --> 10:21.060
Spoken like a true gentleman.

10:26.608 --> 10:28.198
Okay, look, it's a tragic fact,

10:28.278 --> 10:29.938
black men die every day in Freeland.

10:30.018 --> 10:31.758
So, why have you
focused on this one?

10:31.758 --> 10:35.118
Todd Green was near the free clinic
the night it was broken into.

10:35.198 --> 10:37.528
I think the radiation we
found near the break-in site

10:37.538 --> 10:40.908
was from the power supply sustaining
a pod which held a meta-human.

10:40.988 --> 10:43.208
The same meta that showed up
to steal the vaccine kids?

10:43.288 --> 10:44.788
Yes.

10:44.798 --> 10:48.598
You think Todd Green was
involved in the theft?

10:51.208 --> 10:54.348
Unemployed academic?

10:54.428 --> 10:56.228
Not exactly the resume
of a master criminal.

10:56.298 --> 10:58.058
According to his cell phone,

10:58.138 --> 11:01.178
the day he was fired, the kid was
in the neighborhood of Club 100.

11:01.258 --> 11:02.818
You think he was working
for Tobias?

11:02.888 --> 11:05.188
It was just a theory,
until he was found blown up.

11:05.258 --> 11:06.648
And we both know
that's Tobias's MO.

11:06.718 --> 11:08.278
So Tobias has the vaccine kids

11:08.358 --> 11:10.448
and a meta from the free clinic?

11:10.528 --> 11:12.238
Or metas. We don't know
how many there were.

11:12.318 --> 11:14.818
Great. One or worse than one.

11:14.898 --> 11:17.158
Your lead is dead.
How do we find him?

11:17.228 --> 11:19.578
The radiation from
the power supply

11:19.588 --> 11:23.038
sustaining for the pod,
or pods, is very low-level,

11:23.108 --> 11:24.758
so it can't be tracked
by satellite.

11:24.828 --> 11:27.038
But I've installed Geiger
counters around Freeland,

11:27.118 --> 11:29.128
hoping to triangulate
a location.

11:29.138 --> 11:30.258
The pods aren't moving.

11:30.338 --> 11:32.758
Radiation flies with the wind.

11:32.838 --> 11:35.428
Wind speed and direction
will be my measurable elements.

11:37.378 --> 11:39.098
Do I have this on right?

11:39.178 --> 11:40.858
That's for your arm.

11:42.178 --> 11:42.978
Oh.

11:44.588 --> 11:45.778
Okay, got it.

11:48.618 --> 11:51.988
Floating radiation
leading to lethal metas...

11:53.858 --> 11:56.788
Just when I thought being a parent
couldn't get any more stressful.

11:58.198 --> 12:00.958
Jeff,
there isn't a parenting book

12:01.038 --> 12:02.908
for what you and Lynn
are trying to do,

12:02.988 --> 12:05.458
but you're doing
a hell of a job anyway.

12:07.708 --> 12:11.798
Yes, yes, yes.

12:11.878 --> 12:15.518
They gonna add it up
and they gonna eat it down.

12:17.048 --> 12:18.268
Who's that?

12:19.978 --> 12:22.398
No. Not "Who is that,"

12:23.218 --> 12:24.358
"What's that."

12:26.558 --> 12:31.028
Roadkill possum.

12:33.278 --> 12:35.438
You know,

12:35.518 --> 12:41.278
sometimes I try to bring something
back that's particularly pustulent.

12:41.358 --> 12:43.288
Just a little

12:44.578 --> 12:46.878
pungent.

12:47.658 --> 12:49.008
Why?

12:49.778 --> 12:51.048
I don't know.

12:54.288 --> 12:56.888
To push myself,
you know, Latavious.

12:58.588 --> 13:00.938
Just trying to get better
at what I do.

13:08.268 --> 13:11.598
What's on your mind, son?

13:11.678 --> 13:15.488
I thought I was supposed to kill
Jefferson Pierce because he killed Earl,

13:17.308 --> 13:19.698
but, it turns out
that I killed Earl.

13:21.278 --> 13:24.248
There's nothing but pain
for me in this life.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.918
And who do you blame for that?

13:28.818 --> 13:30.718
Tobias Whale.

13:30.788 --> 13:32.298
Tobias Whale.

13:37.038 --> 13:38.178
You know...

13:40.208 --> 13:42.138
he killed Lady Eve, too.

13:49.548 --> 13:54.108
She brought me here
to Blackbird,

13:54.178 --> 13:56.818
taught me how to use my gifts,

13:56.888 --> 13:58.738
and to love...

14:01.158 --> 14:02.618
Love her...

14:05.988 --> 14:10.758
and the work that I do.

14:11.668 --> 14:13.128
But now

14:14.338 --> 14:16.298
there is a hole in my heart...

14:18.338 --> 14:20.808
and it cannot be filled.

14:25.348 --> 14:27.308
Where Tobias goes,

14:28.778 --> 14:31.278
heartache is sure to follow.

14:31.348 --> 14:33.398
That's why I was thinking...

14:38.688 --> 14:41.158
that maybe he's better off dead.

14:42.098 --> 14:44.158
I wholeheartedly agree.

14:46.778 --> 14:50.458
Okay, Jen. I'm going to direct
an electric charge toward the sleeve.

14:50.538 --> 14:52.458
Now, if the material does
what it is supposed to,

14:52.538 --> 14:54.868
it will absorb that charge,
then disperse it,

14:54.948 --> 14:56.268
so that it doesn't add
to your energy load.

14:56.293 --> 14:57.162
Okay.

14:57.208 --> 14:59.708
Now, I can't control the amount
of power that you generate,

14:59.788 --> 15:02.308
so you still need to work
on controlling your emotions,

15:02.378 --> 15:04.718
but I'm hoping this will prevent
anyone else from overloading you.

15:04.788 --> 15:05.808
Sounds like a plan.

15:05.888 --> 15:07.038
Now, if you get
at all uncomfortable,

15:07.038 --> 15:08.548
just signal me,
and I'll shut it down.

15:08.628 --> 15:09.768
- Okay.
- Ready?

15:21.398 --> 15:23.068
You sure she's going to be okay?

15:23.148 --> 15:24.868
I've taken every precaution.

15:28.908 --> 15:32.708
But, if you're worried,
I've got these gloves.

15:33.658 --> 15:34.898
What are those?

15:34.898 --> 15:37.328
They're viscoelastic,
so they absorb energy.

15:37.338 --> 15:39.218
I developed them when you were a
kid, in case you overloaded.

15:45.458 --> 15:48.558
When she was a baby,
I never imagined we'd end up here.

15:49.428 --> 15:51.098
I hear you.

15:51.108 --> 15:52.768
The material's working.

15:52.838 --> 15:55.098
Okay, Jen, you can power down,

15:55.178 --> 15:56.738
I'm gonna let you out.

15:58.938 --> 16:00.528
So you didn't feel anything?

16:00.608 --> 16:01.868
- Nope.
- Awesome.

16:01.938 --> 16:03.478
Okay, when will
the full suit be ready?

16:03.558 --> 16:05.038
Well, not until I finish
the insulation.

16:05.108 --> 16:07.108
Until then, it's probably more
harmful than it is helpful.

16:07.188 --> 16:09.918
But come on, I'll show you how
the whole thing fits together.

16:10.478 --> 16:11.418
Okay.

16:45.818 --> 16:47.328
Why are you bleeding so much?

16:50.628 --> 16:53.278
Dad! You don't want
to see the suit?

16:53.358 --> 16:55.418
No. I'll wait.

16:56.658 --> 16:58.458
I recognize that look.

16:59.158 --> 17:00.838
What?

17:00.918 --> 17:02.678
The look on your face. You are
thinking sappy thoughts, aren't you.

17:03.698 --> 17:04.998
No, I'm not.

17:05.078 --> 17:06.178
What were you thinking about?

17:07.748 --> 17:11.428
Lunch. You pick.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.848
Okay, I'ma go get changed.
Starving.

17:21.278 --> 17:24.438
Do you ever get
a static problem?

17:24.518 --> 17:26.028
You mean with the electricity?

17:26.098 --> 17:26.988
Mmm-hmm.

17:27.528 --> 17:28.948
No.

17:29.028 --> 17:31.448
Good, because I don't want
the powers to mess up my hair.

17:34.288 --> 17:35.368
That's better.

17:35.438 --> 17:36.708
You are getting way too serious.

17:38.038 --> 17:39.168
So, this code...

17:39.778 --> 17:41.278
Yes?

17:41.358 --> 17:43.048
Look, I know you want us to
make good choices, all right.

17:43.128 --> 17:46.088
Somebody throws me shade
at school, do not power up.

17:46.158 --> 17:47.918
There's a cat caught in a tree,

17:47.998 --> 17:49.208
call the fire department.

17:49.288 --> 17:52.808
Freeland gets attacked
by a giant marshmallow...

17:52.888 --> 17:54.638
Uh, s'mores for everyone?

17:58.478 --> 18:02.098
But Tobias, he's a totally
different category, Dad.

18:02.178 --> 18:05.398
Think about it,
all of our problems come from him.

18:05.468 --> 18:08.108
It doesn't matter.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.358
Freeland would be better off
if he were permanently gone.

18:10.438 --> 18:12.788
You don't mean
"permanently gone,"

18:13.568 --> 18:14.538
you mean "dead."

18:15.958 --> 18:19.668
And, it's not about whether
he deserves it,

18:19.748 --> 18:24.788
though the Good Book says it
is not our decision to make.

18:24.868 --> 18:26.788
It also says
"an eye for an eye."

18:26.868 --> 18:29.428
Which is an idea older than
the Bible, Jen.

18:30.258 --> 18:32.258
Hammurabi's Code.

18:32.328 --> 18:35.718
It was meant to limit
vengeance, not justify it.

18:35.798 --> 18:38.058
Khalil died because you put him out front.
Doesn't that matter?

18:42.338 --> 18:46.108
You know, I have had a long time
to think about my powers, Jennifer.

18:46.178 --> 18:50.198
Some days I feel like
I have it all figured out,

18:50.278 --> 18:52.948
but most of the time,
I have no idea...

18:53.018 --> 18:57.788
No idea why God saw fit
to put this burden on me.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.378
The only thing I know for sure

19:00.448 --> 19:02.208
is that those
with the greatest power

19:02.288 --> 19:05.718
should not be able to
decide who lives or dies.

19:08.368 --> 19:09.928
No, that is a path

19:11.968 --> 19:13.928
that can only lead to darkness.

19:19.628 --> 19:20.648
You hear me?

19:21.378 --> 19:22.778
Yeah, Dad, I do.

19:27.688 --> 19:29.978
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:30.058 --> 19:32.608
Oh, she's going to like that.

19:32.688 --> 19:33.888
I hope so.

19:33.958 --> 19:35.248
But more importantly,
when it's finished,

19:35.318 --> 19:37.158
- I hope it will keep her safe.
- Keep her safe?

19:39.528 --> 19:42.248
I'm nothing if not predictable.

19:42.328 --> 19:44.408
What do you need, sweetheart?

19:44.488 --> 19:45.628
So, I've been looking for Grace,

19:45.708 --> 19:47.208
but, Uncle Gambi,
what I'm finding

19:47.278 --> 19:49.748
is raising more questions
than answers.

19:49.828 --> 19:52.208
So, an elderly Asian man
with wicked martial arts skills

19:52.288 --> 19:54.098
almost kicked my ass,

19:54.178 --> 19:56.178
a half-eaten horse is just...

19:56.248 --> 19:58.978
I could have guessed all day
and never gotten to those.

19:59.048 --> 20:01.178
- His eyes. They...
- What about them?

20:01.258 --> 20:02.348
They changed at some point.

20:02.418 --> 20:04.598
It was like he morphed, I guess.

20:04.608 --> 20:06.778
He might be a shapeshifter.

20:06.848 --> 20:08.348
Metas come
in many different forms.

20:08.428 --> 20:10.278
- Is that what it sounds like?
- Yes.

20:10.358 --> 20:13.528
And it could also explain the horse,
if his true form is that of an animal.

20:14.358 --> 20:16.028
Did his eyes look human?

20:16.098 --> 20:18.658
Yeah. Well, I...
I don't know.

20:18.668 --> 20:19.958
If he was a meta,
the real question is,

20:20.028 --> 20:21.528
what did he want with Grace?

20:21.608 --> 20:23.368
You didn't tell her about
your powers, did you?

20:23.448 --> 20:24.368
Because if she told
someone else...

20:24.448 --> 20:26.838
No, no. I definitely didn't.

20:31.748 --> 20:34.508
Sweetheart, if she loves you
the way you say you love her,

20:35.638 --> 20:37.848
she will find her way
back to you.

20:41.048 --> 20:43.888
I've arranged for you to
meet a woman named Perenna.

20:43.968 --> 20:46.318
She's a therapist and a healer.

20:46.388 --> 20:48.888
She's gonna help you
understand your powers

20:48.968 --> 20:51.228
and hopefully be
at peace with them.

20:51.308 --> 20:54.698
Perenna, that's a pretty name.

20:55.728 --> 20:56.988
You'll like her.

21:00.648 --> 21:02.368
Do I have to go to her?

21:02.448 --> 21:05.418
I think, to start off with,
we'll have her come to you.

21:06.408 --> 21:08.378
Okay, good.

21:11.418 --> 21:13.508
Are you nervous?

21:13.588 --> 21:15.388
About going back into Freeland?

21:16.758 --> 21:18.848
It's been 30 years.

21:20.258 --> 21:23.398
Everything I knew is gone.

21:24.768 --> 21:29.238
I'm not nervous,
I'm just sad, I guess.

21:30.348 --> 21:31.948
It feels lonely.

21:34.438 --> 21:36.368
It's hard to think
about going back into a world

21:36.438 --> 21:38.868
that's moved on without you,

21:38.948 --> 21:43.118
especially given
that you have rare gifts,

21:43.188 --> 21:46.208
but you have a choice about
what to do with your powers.

21:46.288 --> 21:49.418
Once you can control them,
you can use them or not.

21:50.718 --> 21:53.788
You'll always be a meta, Wendy,

21:53.868 --> 21:57.508
but that doesn't mean you
can't be a teacher or a doctor.

21:59.468 --> 22:02.928
I can't remember
what I wanted to be.

22:02.998 --> 22:05.518
I'll make sure
you have time to remember.

22:06.418 --> 22:08.808
I'm here for you, okay?

22:08.878 --> 22:10.148
Anything you need.

22:14.428 --> 22:16.948
Look, I know you don't like
working with Agent Odell.

22:20.268 --> 22:22.288
I appreciate that you stay.

22:23.688 --> 22:24.828
Come.

22:27.828 --> 22:29.298
It'll be okay.

22:36.199 --> 22:39.669
Look, I know
it's only a semi-automatic.

22:39.749 --> 22:43.849
I'm sorry, but I ain't never
had much use for guns.

22:48.129 --> 22:49.149
It'll do.

22:51.019 --> 22:54.349
I can understand why you'd
want to be armed, I mean...

22:54.429 --> 22:58.479
Everybody's armed,
but know this,

22:58.489 --> 23:02.119
no gun is more powerful
than you are.

23:02.189 --> 23:04.489
You see, your real weapon,
Latavious,

23:04.569 --> 23:10.499
is that while you can die, you can
always be brought back to life again.

23:11.869 --> 23:14.329
And I know, it'll be painful.

23:14.409 --> 23:18.339
The dying, the returning,
the returning, the dying...

23:20.199 --> 23:23.849
But it'll be worth it.

23:25.049 --> 23:27.309
It will allow you
to do great things.

23:27.389 --> 23:29.349
I don't want to do great things.

23:30.669 --> 23:31.519
I'm tired.

23:32.309 --> 23:33.969
I know.

23:33.979 --> 23:35.529
I just want to rest.

23:36.639 --> 23:40.279
Lala, if you kill Tobias,

23:41.679 --> 23:43.989
you'll feel much better.

23:52.909 --> 23:56.079
Negro, you think this is funny?

23:56.159 --> 23:58.459
I've taken out
an entire village by myself.

23:58.529 --> 24:01.179
I'm not about to practice
fighting with this fool.

24:01.249 --> 24:02.589
I'm no damn dog.

24:02.659 --> 24:04.429
Black Lightning and this banana girl

24:04.509 --> 24:07.679
represent the only metas in Freeland
that have ever gotten the better of me.

24:07.759 --> 24:09.349
As much as I hate them,

24:09.429 --> 24:11.019
right now it seems like
you aren't fit

24:11.099 --> 24:13.559
to kiss the bottom of
their stupid-looking boots.

24:13.639 --> 24:15.849
So, if you can't get yourself
together and show some discipline,

24:15.929 --> 24:17.229
I'm gonna kill your black ass.

24:20.139 --> 24:22.019
This idiot's worth
millions of dollars.

24:22.099 --> 24:23.409
What the hell are you doing?

24:24.019 --> 24:24.909
Saving you.

24:26.609 --> 24:28.779
Suture his neck, please.

24:28.859 --> 24:30.859
Don't worry,
the blade isn't poisoned.

24:30.869 --> 24:36.039
And a little blood loss will teach
him a lesson.

24:59.979 --> 25:01.399
<i>You gonna shoot me?</i>

25:01.479 --> 25:02.599
<i>Get down on the ground!</i>

25:02.609 --> 25:03.899
<i>You gonna shoot me?</i>

25:03.969 --> 25:05.469
<i>Now!</i>

25:05.469 --> 25:06.319
<i>Don't shoot me!
I'm on your side.</i>

25:06.389 --> 25:07.529
<i>I'm trying to help you!</i>

25:07.599 --> 25:08.539
<i>Down!</i>

25:10.989 --> 25:12.319
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>

25:12.399 --> 25:14.119
I just wanted
to make sure you're okay.

25:15.229 --> 25:16.829
Yeah, I mean, the world

25:16.899 --> 25:18.619
<i>is about to blow up
because of Cape Guy.</i>

25:18.629 --> 25:20.499
<i>But, just a normal day
in Freeland, right?</i>

25:20.569 --> 25:21.919
- I'm sure...
<i>- Black Lightning and Thunder</i>

25:21.999 --> 25:23.589
will take care of it. I know.

25:23.669 --> 25:24.589
It's what they do.

25:24.669 --> 25:25.639
We help.

25:27.579 --> 25:29.929
Is there something else,
'cause I really am fine.

25:33.419 --> 25:37.769
I was also gonna ask if
you'd be willing to talk to Wendy.

25:37.849 --> 25:39.269
<i>You mean Wind Girl?</i>

25:39.349 --> 25:42.389
That's not what we call her,
but yes.

25:42.469 --> 25:44.339
About what?

25:44.339 --> 25:47.019
Her wardrobe is 30 years out of date
but Pinterest can help with that.

25:47.099 --> 25:48.189
It's not about clothes.

25:48.269 --> 25:50.739
It's about
how you feel about having...

25:51.939 --> 25:53.459
What?

25:53.529 --> 25:57.789
It's probably not
a conversation for the phone.

25:57.869 --> 26:04.969
Oh. You want me to talk to her
about all the juice and the feelings

26:05.039 --> 26:07.969
<i>that come along
with having the juice.</i>

26:08.049 --> 26:12.879
Yes. She's having
a hard time adjusting.

26:12.959 --> 26:14.139
From one weirdo to another.

26:14.219 --> 26:16.459
<i>You're not a weirdo.</i>

26:16.539 --> 26:21.139
<i>You're the same wonderful, sensitive,
smart, loving person you've always been.</i>

26:21.149 --> 26:22.979
<i>But if you had known
how all this was gonna go,</i>

26:23.059 --> 26:26.319
I bet you would've considered
a more vigorous birth control.

26:26.399 --> 26:28.909
I wouldn't change a thing.

26:32.569 --> 26:34.329
All right, yeah.

26:34.409 --> 26:37.739
I don't have a problem talking to
Windy Wendy, but what about the code?

26:37.819 --> 26:40.169
<i>Rule number one is don't share.</i>

26:40.249 --> 26:42.499
I'm confident we can
figure something out.

26:42.579 --> 26:44.509
Masks and voice synthesizers?

26:44.579 --> 26:47.679
We will go full on
<i>Mission Impossible.</i>

26:47.749 --> 26:49.549
Yeah, all right.

26:50.039 --> 26:51.179
Oh, Mom...

26:51.259 --> 26:52.179
Yeah?

26:53.499 --> 26:55.889
Thank you for saying
that I'm not a weirdo.

26:57.339 --> 26:59.799
I know that's what
you think, but

26:59.879 --> 27:01.229
it's still really nice to hear.

27:02.629 --> 27:04.179
I love you.

27:04.189 --> 27:05.439
Love you.

27:10.609 --> 27:13.199
So, who should we choose?

27:13.279 --> 27:15.699
Marcus is too weak,
thanks to you.

27:15.779 --> 27:17.369
He's an ass anyway.

27:17.449 --> 27:18.339
I like Rebecca,

27:18.340 --> 27:22.199
but I don't think sending a woman
would appeal to your target audience.

27:22.209 --> 27:24.919
Hmm...
Men can be stupid that way.

27:26.959 --> 27:29.049
I vote for Joe.

27:29.129 --> 27:31.759
His powers will look good
on camera, that's for sure.

27:33.869 --> 27:35.269
Joe it is.

27:48.269 --> 27:49.479
What are they doing here?

27:49.559 --> 27:51.239
- Training Wendy.
- No.

27:51.319 --> 27:53.149
She has powers,
but she doesn't know how to use them.

27:53.229 --> 27:55.149
You almost killed her
when you activated her.

27:55.229 --> 27:57.579
- I'll be careful.
- I don't trust you to be anything.

27:57.659 --> 27:59.489
Wendy's been stuck
in a pod for 30 years.

27:59.569 --> 28:03.239
And she's lost everything, except
these powers that she didn't ask for.

28:03.249 --> 28:05.329
And I'm not letting you
anywhere near her

28:05.399 --> 28:07.249
until she can figure out
how to handle that.

28:07.259 --> 28:09.869
Dr. Stewart,
whether she chose them or not,

28:09.949 --> 28:12.039
she has skills
that could be of use...

28:12.119 --> 28:13.299
No!

28:15.339 --> 28:17.589
She is gonna have therapy, okay?

28:17.599 --> 28:19.099
She's gonna finish high school.

28:19.179 --> 28:21.439
She's gonna learn
how to balance a checkbook

28:21.509 --> 28:23.609
or do pottery or whatever
she wants to do.

28:23.679 --> 28:28.279
And then, only then,
can she become one of your soldiers.

28:39.289 --> 28:40.159
Okay.

28:41.699 --> 28:43.459
I hear you.

28:43.989 --> 28:45.339
I'll wait.

28:55.961 --> 28:57.541
A half-eaten horse?

28:57.551 --> 28:59.371
I assumed.

28:59.381 --> 29:01.381
I suppose
it could have been half-rotten.

29:03.461 --> 29:06.721
I know you're upset because you
can't find Grace, and I get it.

29:06.801 --> 29:08.391
It's totally understandable,

29:08.471 --> 29:10.101
but were you stoned
when you went over there?

29:11.341 --> 29:12.971
Tell the truth,

29:13.051 --> 29:15.561
'cause a fighting Asian man and
a half-eaten horse sound crazy.

29:15.571 --> 29:17.781
No, I wasn't stoned.
That's you.

29:17.851 --> 29:20.491
- Yeah...
- That's what I saw. And I...

29:22.561 --> 29:25.401
Hey, your eyes?
They change color?

29:25.411 --> 29:27.411
Uh...

29:27.941 --> 29:28.971
You okay?

29:32.781 --> 29:33.961
Yeah, I'm fine.

29:36.571 --> 29:39.801
Oh, no, they're the same.
Thought they were lighter for a second.

29:41.801 --> 29:43.471
Where's Grace Choi?

29:53.351 --> 29:54.481
I got to go.

29:55.181 --> 29:56.501
Where are you going?

29:56.501 --> 29:58.941
Uh-uh, you can't just go.
I tell you everything.

30:00.931 --> 30:03.611
Look, Gambi said something
about a shapeshifter,

30:03.691 --> 30:05.901
someone who could be
a danger to Grace.

30:05.981 --> 30:09.321
Jen, I think
the shapeshifter was Grace.

30:09.331 --> 30:10.771
Grace is a meta.

30:10.851 --> 30:13.321
And she ran because
she thought I would reject her.

30:13.401 --> 30:15.831
If I'd just told her
who I was, then...

30:16.871 --> 30:18.871
Find her. Screw the rules.

30:18.951 --> 30:20.711
Anissa, find her and
tell her who you are.

30:24.301 --> 30:26.041
The world is unfair.

30:26.121 --> 30:29.631
Governments control
the police, the armies,

30:29.711 --> 30:33.341
<i>and those with great dreams
are left on the outside,</i>

30:33.421 --> 30:36.481
<i>lacking the tools to bend
the world to their own will.</i>

30:36.561 --> 30:41.821
<i>So imagine a single soldier
strong as an entire army.</i>

30:41.891 --> 30:46.651
Imagine soldiers trained by
the best military in the world.

30:46.661 --> 30:49.911
I'm sending you a video
from the dark web.

30:49.991 --> 30:52.331
Tobias just unleashed a different
kind of meta on Freeland

30:52.411 --> 30:54.241
for some kind of demonstration.

30:54.311 --> 30:56.491
<i>I think he's
created a mercenary army.</i>

30:56.501 --> 31:00.251
But with weapons no money can buy.

31:01.991 --> 31:07.511
Meta-human soldiers, now available
to those who can afford them.

31:07.591 --> 31:09.341
Where's Fire Boy headed?

31:09.351 --> 31:10.801
He's headed down Wilson Street,

31:10.871 --> 31:12.341
but there's not much over there.

31:12.351 --> 31:13.771
Well, there has to be something.

31:13.841 --> 31:15.731
Tobias wants more chaos,
not less.

31:22.251 --> 31:24.691
Councilman Parker is showing
off a new mall project.

31:24.771 --> 31:27.531
He's giving a speech.
Dignitaries and press.

31:27.611 --> 31:29.361
What did Parker
ever do to Tobias?

31:29.371 --> 31:30.681
I have no idea.

31:30.761 --> 31:32.861
Five hundred jobs is just
for the construction.

31:32.941 --> 31:35.961
Once this project is finished and
these offices are filled with people,

31:36.031 --> 31:38.541
there will be more jobs.
Jobs in the dining industry...

31:40.781 --> 31:42.161
Don't just stand there,
stop him!

31:47.411 --> 31:48.931
Everyone, get out!

31:51.131 --> 31:52.631
Get out!

31:59.651 --> 32:01.021
Woo!

32:15.206 --> 32:16.966
The meta's moving
inside the mall.

32:17.046 --> 32:18.136
You got to give me something.

32:18.216 --> 32:19.806
He's heating up some pipes.

32:21.046 --> 32:22.686
- For what?
- I don't know.

32:29.926 --> 32:30.856
They're gas pipes.

32:34.566 --> 32:36.116
He's super heating them.

32:42.766 --> 32:44.996
Houses in west Freeland
are catching on fire.

32:45.076 --> 32:47.706
West Freeland?
Jen is home alone.

32:47.786 --> 32:48.956
I'm on it.

33:58.646 --> 34:01.026
- You should tell him to retreat.
- No.

34:01.096 --> 34:04.816
You said yourself, Black Lightning
and Thunder are formidable.

34:04.826 --> 34:06.816
One meta might not be enough
to beat them.

34:06.896 --> 34:08.496
- Let him try.
- And if he fails?

34:11.326 --> 34:13.585
Tobias, you can't sell
a dead meta.

34:21.835 --> 34:23.206
Fine.

34:23.216 --> 34:24.096
Joe, get out of there.

34:28.505 --> 34:29.846
Let him go.

34:37.596 --> 34:39.936
Figure out how to cool
these gas lines

34:39.946 --> 34:41.366
and keep Freeland
from burning down.

34:42.686 --> 34:44.116
How long do I have to stay here?

34:44.196 --> 34:45.136
I don't know.

34:45.146 --> 34:46.446
There's a fridge
under the stairs

34:46.525 --> 34:47.616
and you have Internet access.

34:47.696 --> 34:49.525
Yeah, I just have
a ton of math to do,

34:49.606 --> 34:51.626
and this isn't my usual
studying vibe.

34:51.696 --> 34:53.795
Well, your dad and sister are
working to put out those fires

34:53.866 --> 34:55.366
and I don't think
it'll be long until...

34:55.446 --> 34:56.406
<i>Where's Jennifer?</i>

34:56.485 --> 34:58.706
Here. Safe.

34:58.716 --> 35:00.636
<i>Thanks. Any news?</i>

35:00.706 --> 35:02.956
The radiation algorithm
has generated an address.

35:02.966 --> 35:05.006
You know where Tobias is.

35:05.076 --> 35:06.456
I know where the pods are.

35:06.526 --> 35:08.476
<i>We haven't finished
cooling the pipes yet.</i>

35:08.546 --> 35:10.546
All right. Well, I'll go
watch over that location

35:10.626 --> 35:11.756
<i>until you can get there.</i>

35:11.836 --> 35:13.896
<i>- I'm sending you the address.</i>
- Okay.

35:19.226 --> 35:21.556
Jen, stay here
and make yourself comfortable.

35:21.636 --> 35:23.526
- I'll be back as soon as I can.
- Okay.

35:52.842 --> 35:55.672
I wouldn't have said retreat if
I didn't think it was necessary.

35:55.752 --> 35:58.432
I did what you suggested.

35:58.512 --> 36:01.272
No good can come
from rubbing it in my face.

36:01.342 --> 36:02.752
I'm not.

36:02.832 --> 36:04.932
And I appreciate you
meeting with me in private.

36:04.942 --> 36:08.272
I think that Cutter
is a little too possessive.

36:08.282 --> 36:11.352
A long time ago,
I was too proud to retreat,

36:11.432 --> 36:13.782
and I ended up indentured
to a rogue nation

36:13.862 --> 36:16.782
and then the worst people
in the US government.

36:16.862 --> 36:20.112
I've lost everything because I
didn't have the good sense to stop.

36:20.122 --> 36:21.292
That sucks for you.

36:21.362 --> 36:23.662
I'm smarter than you are.

36:23.672 --> 36:25.952
It's not an insult.
It's a fact.

36:26.032 --> 36:28.702
I'm smarter than virtually
everyone I meet.

36:28.782 --> 36:30.302
It's annoying,
but I've learned to live with it.

36:30.372 --> 36:34.052
What I lack is your genius
for survival.

36:35.212 --> 36:37.642
I think we'd make a good team.

36:37.712 --> 36:40.142
I can't kill people
with a whisk,

36:40.222 --> 36:43.232
but my big brain can solve
a whole lot of problems.

36:45.722 --> 36:47.232
So far, I'm not impressed.

36:49.392 --> 36:51.862
And I actually appreciate
Cutter's possessiveness.

37:03.412 --> 37:06.002
We had to open a hole in the gas
line to release the pressure,

37:06.082 --> 37:07.492
<i>the gas company
is on the way to fix it.</i>

37:07.502 --> 37:09.212
Shouldn't have any more fires
downstream.

37:10.082 --> 37:11.082
Have you seen anything?

37:11.162 --> 37:12.162
Nothing.

37:12.242 --> 37:13.592
<i>Okay, I'm on my way.</i>

37:20.292 --> 37:21.722
Where is Tobias?

37:23.432 --> 37:24.592
Who are you?

37:24.672 --> 37:26.512
It doesn't matter.

37:26.522 --> 37:28.512
How did you get in here?

37:28.522 --> 37:31.362
Where's Tobias?

37:31.432 --> 37:33.352
He's, uh...

37:55.702 --> 38:00.092
Death is knocking,
but ain't nobody home.

38:00.102 --> 38:03.772
I can't really die, sweetheart.
How about you?

38:25.902 --> 38:27.292
All the time I put into this,

38:27.372 --> 38:29.082
and that Black Lightning
and banana girl

38:29.162 --> 38:31.082
somehow show up and ruin...

38:33.782 --> 38:36.252
For a guy so focused
on getting rich,

38:36.262 --> 38:38.422
you are very cavalier
with your assets.

38:38.432 --> 38:41.882
Only thing worse than a loud-mouthed
Negro is a loud-mouthed white woman.

38:41.952 --> 38:44.132
Todd would still be with us
if he'd kept his mouth shut.

38:44.212 --> 38:47.272
I suggest you keep yours shut.

38:47.342 --> 38:49.772
- Someone's here looking for you.
- Whoever it is, kill him.

38:49.852 --> 38:51.732
Tried. Didn't work. Let's go.

38:53.022 --> 38:55.442
Rebecca, get everyone
to the rendezvous spot.

39:06.982 --> 39:09.462
I checked.

39:09.532 --> 39:11.672
Your neighborhood is now safe.

39:12.782 --> 39:13.582
Thank you.

39:14.572 --> 39:16.802
Freeland's lucky to have them.

39:16.872 --> 39:19.222
- Who?
- Black Lightning and Thunder.

39:21.452 --> 39:23.342
Don't you agree?

39:23.352 --> 39:26.142
Yes, they're...
They're quite something.

39:26.222 --> 39:28.392
Hmm...

39:30.552 --> 39:32.192
Have a good night.

39:45.702 --> 39:47.492
Tobias just exited the building.

39:47.502 --> 39:49.142
Can you hold them?

39:52.982 --> 39:55.172
- Oh, no.
<i>- What is it?</i>

39:55.242 --> 39:56.872
It's Jen. She's here...

39:56.882 --> 39:58.672
She's wearing her suit.
It's not ready.

39:59.372 --> 40:00.302
Damn!

40:08.212 --> 40:11.232
- What the hell is that?
- Don't know, don't care.

40:23.682 --> 40:25.032
You can't get away.

40:25.112 --> 40:29.082
I will find you, and I'll...
I'll kill...
