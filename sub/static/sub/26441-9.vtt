does this look to you?

13:25.160 --> 13:26.160
Not very.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.277
Let's look around carefully.

13:28.560 --> 13:30.870
Hey, Doc, there's some lights
around that rock.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.156
Nice spot, Graham.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.160
Both of you, stay close.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.193
Let's make sure
we can find our ways back.

14:07.520 --> 14:10.035
Have you seen either a very loud
creature heading that way

14:10.120 --> 14:13.477
or a Norwegian human
possibly heading the other way?

14:14.000 --> 14:15.070
Name of Erik.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.516
The human.

14:16.840 --> 14:18.320
His daughter's missing him.

14:19.080 --> 14:20.480
Such tragedy.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.272
Makes me hungry.

No.

Fine. If you can't help us,
can we have your lantern

14:29.440 --> 14:31.360
'cause you seem to have
a monopoly on light here.

14:31.640 --> 14:34.792
Hmm, no charity. Only trade.

Away.

14:36.920 --> 14:38.798
Lantern not yours.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.394
All right. I was only looking.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.480
Take it easy.

14:42.160 --> 14:43.480

I so want your tubular.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.196
Such a shiny tubular.

15:10.800 --> 15:14.111
Because Ribbons did see
the man you seek,

15:14.560 --> 15:16.870
er, trade is now possible.

15:17.400 --> 15:22.191
With this tubular,
you can buy this tasty information,

15:22.280 --> 15:24.192
plus one lantern.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.871
What did he look like, this man?

15:28.560 --> 15:31.200
Oh, no horns, one mouth.

15:31.760 --> 15:32.955
So ugly.

15:33.560 --> 15:38.077
Like you, but such nice big boots.

15:38.720 --> 15:39.720
So, he's alive.

15:41.280 --> 15:43.590
Was anyone with him, or any thing?

15:44.280 --> 15:46.237
You'll find when I take you.

Hey, Doc. You're not gonna
give him the sonic, are you? Look.

He's got a belt full of
massive dead rats with six legs.

16:17.400 --> 16:18.754
Graham's right.

16:18.840 --> 16:20.433
For all we know, he took Erik.

16:20.720 --> 16:23.235
And now, you want us to follow
that nutter into the dark.

16:23.320 --> 16:25.471
No, I want you to follow
this nutter into the dark.

16:25.560 --> 16:27.358
There's three of us and only one of him.

- Okay.

I'm sorry. I was wrong.

Which part of the house
is weakest on the map?

17:04.560 --> 17:07.712
Er, the conservatory.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.071

17:13.960 --> 17:15.633
That's not a map, is it?

17:15.720 --> 17:17.175
It sounded like
she was writing something.

I want my dad.

Let go of me!

You can't just grab me
and drag me around.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.640
- I could call the police.
- What?

17:34.840 --> 17:37.355
And tell them about the monster
or the portal in the mirror?

17:37.440 --> 17:38.556
How's that gonna help?

17:38.640 --> 17:41.678

about what she wrote on the wall.

- That was closer.

are you talking us, Ribbons?

25:56.240 --> 25:57.469
But here I am.

25:57.560 --> 25:58.630
(CHUCKLES)

25:58.720 --> 26:01.997
She can't leave. We try,
but she can't go through the mirror.

26:02.640 --> 26:04.313
I know I stayed away
from Hanne too long,

26:04.400 --> 26:07.040
but I kept thinking,
"What if I go, and I can't come back?"

26:08.680 --> 26:11.195
(SIGHS) I can't lose Trine again.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.680
GRAHAM: You gotta get
your priorities straight, mate.

26:14.160 --> 26:15.799
Your daughter needs you. Come on.

26:16.320 --> 26:17.720
Don't you want to see your friend?

26:18.640 --> 26:19.790
What are you talking about?

26:21.160 --> 26:22.799
She got here when you did.

26:38.080 --> 26:40.197
(WOMAN HUMMING)

26:40.280 --> 26:42.397
- All right?
- Yeah, I, erm...

26:42.480 --> 26:43.755
I know that sound.

26:55.080 --> 26:56.799
Graham O'Brien.

26:58.480 --> 27:00.631
You better tell me right now
what's going on.

27:03.680 --> 27:05.080
Don't do this to me.

27:14.800 --> 27:15.995
(BREATHING SHAKILY)

27:19.480 --> 27:22.200
- RYAN: Don't move. Stand really still.
- (GASPING)

27:22.800 --> 27:24.029
It's me. Ryan.

27:27.200 --> 27:29.635
All right, uh,
I'm just gonna sort something,

27:30.560 --> 27:32.472
then we're gonna move together.

27:33.880 --> 27:35.519
There's a light stashed here.

27:38.440 --> 27:39.794
(GRUNTING)

27:39.880 --> 27:42.156
(GASPS AND BREATHES SHAKILY)

27:46.480 --> 27:48.756
All right. Just hold my sleeve.

27:48.840 --> 27:51.116
- HANNE: Where are we?
- No idea. Stay close.

27:52.480 --> 27:53.675
All right.

27:57.520 --> 27:59.000
HANNE: Tell me what you can see.

28:00.160 --> 28:01.799
Well, there's kind of a cave.

28:02.520 --> 28:03.840
Nice cave, though.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.876
You ever been to the Peak District?
A bit like that.

28:07.960 --> 28:10.077
Ryan, you're lying to me.

28:11.040 --> 28:12.952
I'm sorry for slamming the door on you.

28:13.560 --> 28:15.438
I had to get in here to find my dad.

28:16.520 --> 28:18.193
Fine. You want the truth?

28:19.240 --> 28:21.152
The monsters in the woods
were just recordings.

28:21.280 --> 28:23.397
I reckon your dad did that
to keep you inside.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.800
Should've just got Wi-Fi.

28:26.920 --> 28:28.513
He lied to me.

28:30.720 --> 28:32.791
- Yeah.
- And now you're lying to me

28:32.880 --> 28:34.473
about how bad it is in here.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.594
I'm trying to look after you.

28:37.680 --> 28:41.594
I know this sounds daft, but am I real?

28:42.320 --> 28:44.994
That creature on the crane,
it killed me.

28:46.080 --> 28:48.675
But now I'm here with you.

28:50.680 --> 28:52.399
I... I don't understand.

28:53.920 --> 28:55.479
No, neither do I.

28:56.280 --> 28:57.999
Why are you being so off with me?

28:58.840 --> 29:00.274
Because this isn't possible.

29:00.920 --> 29:01.956
I know.

29:02.520 --> 29:04.910
But I'm here, love. I'm real.

29:06.760 --> 29:10.549
If you're Grace,
tell me everything about this necklace.

29:12.120 --> 29:13.270
GRACE: It's mine.

29:14.480 --> 29:17.040
You gave it to me two Christmases ago.

29:18.080 --> 29:20.549
Same year Ryan got me
a different frog necklace.

29:21.640 --> 29:23.359
'Cause I like frogs.

29:24.440 --> 29:26.955
You two didn't check with each other
before you went shopping.

29:28.320 --> 29:29.674
And you're wearing it

29:30.840 --> 29:32.672
as a way of keeping me close.

29:33.120 --> 29:34.679
This is unfair.

29:37.960 --> 29:42.239
This has to be a trick. You... You...
You can't be her.

29:43.320 --> 29:44.834
I feel like me.

29:47.560 --> 29:49.040
YASMIN: That can't be Grace.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.793
- Can it?
- No.

29:51.680 --> 29:53.558
And you can't be Erik's wife.

29:53.680 --> 29:58.072
I know. But we are, aren't we?

30:01.440 --> 30:02.954
DOCTOR: All right. No need to panic.

30:03.680 --> 30:04.830
I wasn't panicking.

30:04.920 --> 30:06.479
I know. I was talking to myself.

30:06.560 --> 30:09.280
'Cause all this is very wrong.

30:09.960 --> 30:11.314
Right. What do we know?

30:12.120 --> 30:16.273
This mirror is a direct portal
between two worlds.

30:16.360 --> 30:18.795
We went into it in the real world,

30:18.880 --> 30:20.997
we came out of it in this world.

30:21.080 --> 30:23.231
But that antizone
sprung up in the middle,

30:23.320 --> 30:24.800
splitting the portal in two.

30:24.880 --> 30:27.793
- The buffer zone between the two worlds.
- Exactly.

30:27.880 --> 30:30.952
'Cause antizones only exist
where the fabric of the universe

30:31.040 --> 30:33.680
is under huge, terrible threat.

30:34.520 --> 30:35.556
Oh.

30:35.880 --> 30:39.794
So that means that one must be to stop

30:39.880 --> 30:43.794
this world and your world
from ever touching.

30:44.840 --> 30:47.309
Wait, but that means that
this world is dangerous.

30:47.760 --> 30:49.274
But how can it be dangerous?

30:49.360 --> 30:52.319
Also, what even has the power
to create a copy world like this?

30:52.560 --> 30:53.596
Unless...

30:54.480 --> 30:56.995
Oh, no actual way.

30:57.640 --> 30:59.199
No actual way what?

30:59.280 --> 31:00.919
I've told you about
the Solitract, right?

31:01.000 --> 31:04.755
- Literally never heard the word before.
- Solitract. Solitract.

31:04.840 --> 31:09.232
It's a theory, a myth,
a bedtime story my gran used to tell me.

31:09.320 --> 31:10.470
You had a grandmother?

31:10.560 --> 31:12.279
I had seven, but Granny Five,
my favourite,

31:12.360 --> 31:14.079
used to tell me about the Solitract.

31:16.680 --> 31:20.390
'Cause in the beginning,
pre-time, pre-everything,

31:20.480 --> 31:25.032
all the laws and elements and nuts
and bolts of the universe were there.

31:25.400 --> 31:28.791
The light, matter, maths, and so on,

31:29.000 --> 31:33.233
but they couldn't fit together properly,
because the Solitract was there.

31:33.920 --> 31:35.320
So what is the Solitract?

31:35.400 --> 31:37.596
A consciousness. An energy.

31:37.680 --> 31:40.832
Our reality cannot work
with Solitract energy present.

31:40.920 --> 31:44.436
The most basic ideas of the universe
just get ruined.

31:46.160 --> 31:49.836
Think of it like a kid with chicken pox,
nuclear chicken pox,

31:49.920 --> 31:53.118
who wants to join in, but always ends up
infecting everyone else.

31:53.520 --> 31:57.514
Our universe cannot work
with the Solitract in it.

31:57.720 --> 31:59.996
Your gran told you
this as a bedtime story?

32:00.120 --> 32:02.237
Only when I had trouble sleeping. So...

32:02.320 --> 32:03.800
- What did our universe do?
- (SIGHS)

32:04.840 --> 32:11.394
It managed to exile the Solitract
to a separate, unreachable existence.

32:12.440 --> 32:13.999
The Solitract plane.

32:14.280 --> 32:17.512
And suddenly, everything makes sense.

32:17.840 --> 32:22.551
The universe could finally work,
because the Solitract had been removed.

32:22.680 --> 32:26.276
Hang on. Are you saying
we are now on the Solitract plane?

32:26.360 --> 32:29.432
I wish I wasn't, but I think I am.
I'm scared. Are you scared?

32:30.400 --> 32:32.039
I'm genuinely terrified.

32:32.200 --> 32:35.716
This is a separate exiled universe
that is also a consciousness?

32:35.800 --> 32:39.191
That's what Granny Five said.
A conscious universe.

32:39.520 --> 32:42.115
She also said that Granny Two
was a secret agent for the Zygons,

32:42.200 --> 32:44.032
but she seems bang-on with this one.

32:44.480 --> 32:45.630
But why?

32:46.160 --> 32:48.550
Why has the Solitract copied your world,

32:48.680 --> 32:50.672
including Grace and Trine,

32:51.080 --> 32:53.197
and built a doorway

32:54.160 --> 32:55.753
to our universe?

32:56.720 --> 32:59.838
When you put it like that,
it sounds like a trap.

33:04.040 --> 33:05.679
What are you doing in Norway?

33:05.760 --> 33:08.150
It's the docked ship.
Oh, you'd love it, Grace.

33:08.240 --> 33:10.277
It... It's this whole police box.

33:10.360 --> 33:12.829
And inside,
it's like a massive spaceship.

33:12.960 --> 33:14.599
It goes everywhere and anywhere.

33:14.680 --> 33:16.319
She were telling
the truth that night.

33:16.400 --> 33:17.675
You remember everything, right?

33:17.760 --> 33:19.752
- 'Course I remember everything.
- Yeah.

33:20.720 --> 33:22.996
I've been to an alien planet, Grace.

33:23.280 --> 33:24.316
Me.

33:25.160 --> 33:27.117
And... And I've met Rosa Parks.

33:27.200 --> 33:29.112
- Rosa Parks?
- I know.

33:29.680 --> 33:31.000
(CHUCKLES)

33:31.400 --> 33:33.312
Sounds like you're doing fine
without me.

33:34.920 --> 33:36.115
I'm lost, Grace.

33:36.680 --> 33:37.796
I miss you.

33:38.680 --> 33:41.115
All my life, I was looking for you.
Then I found you.

33:41.480 --> 33:43.949
And I was so happy.

33:44.680 --> 33:46.194
That makes two of us.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.360
Then I lost you.

33:50.960 --> 33:52.110
I'm here.

33:52.200 --> 33:53.839
Yeah, I... I miss you so much.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.720
I miss you so much, Grace.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.476
Graham, we're off. Now.

33:59.600 --> 34:01.751
Uh... Uh, fine. Yeah. Come on, Grace.

34:01.880 --> 34:05.715
Yeah. Sorry to be blunt. Hi, Grace.
That's not Grace. No offence, Grace.

34:05.800 --> 34:08.952
- None taken, love.
- She can't come, Graham. She's not real.

34:09.040 --> 34:10.952
- I think you're wrong.
- I'm not wrong.

34:11.040 --> 34:13.315
- She remembers everything.
- I know this is difficult.

34:13.400 --> 34:15.232
I mean, all the crazy things
you've seen, Doc,

34:15.320 --> 34:17.630
I mean, you can't tell me
that you know it's not her.

34:17.719 --> 34:20.713
This whole thing is a con.
I don't think even Grace knows it.

34:20.800 --> 34:23.713
I think this whole world is a trap,
and she's part of it.

34:24.360 --> 34:27.319
Listen to me.
It's her or the real world.

34:27.440 --> 34:28.920
You can't have both.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.231
Please, get inside. We're going.

34:35.440 --> 34:38.319
I need to get this open,
and get Graham and Erik out of here.

34:39.440 --> 34:40.954
Oh, it won't budge.

34:41.159 --> 34:43.117
It must be controlled by the Solitract.

34:44.199 --> 34:46.271
Oh, and I can't force it
with the sonic like before,

34:46.360 --> 34:48.272
because it's clever and it's adapting.

34:48.520 --> 34:51.159
What if you do something
it hasn't dealt with before,

34:51.239 --> 34:53.391
like reverse the polarity or something?

34:54.800 --> 34:57.395
Yes, we can. You speak my language.

34:57.880 --> 34:59.200
RYAN: Keep running, Hanne!

35:00.000 --> 35:02.037
In here. In here. Get down. Get down.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.157
(SCREECHING)

35:07.560 --> 35:09.199
(GROANING)

35:09.320 --> 35:11.391
- I think we're good to go.
- Nice work, Doctor.

35:11.480 --> 35:12.994
Thank you. I do my best.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.471
Graham, Erik, time to go.

35:15.560 --> 35:18.951
- Come on.
- Graham, you heard what the Doctor said.

35:19.480 --> 35:21.278
- Grace, come on.
- I'm not sure.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.317
I can't hold it open much longer.

35:23.440 --> 35:26.319
Graham, Yaz, Erik, now, please!

35:26.400 --> 35:28.278
(SCREECHING)

35:29.040 --> 35:30.076
Run!

35:35.040 --> 35:37.271
There's a portal straight ahead.
I'll distract them.

35:37.920 --> 35:40.799
- (GASPING) What are you doing here?
- ERIK: Hanne, it's me.

35:40.880 --> 35:42.155
(GASPING)

35:42.240 --> 35:45.711
- (SCREECHING)
- (GASPING)

35:45.800 --> 35:49.032
- I heard my dad!
- It's okay. It's okay. I'm here.

35:49.640 --> 35:51.871
HANNE: Where are we? What's happening?

35:51.960 --> 35:54.600
DOCTOR: The portal's adapted again.
I can't open it.

35:55.320 --> 35:56.800
I've got a surprise for you.

35:57.120 --> 35:58.474
It's your mum, Hanne.

35:59.240 --> 36:00.435
She's alive.

36:00.600 --> 36:02.637
- What?
- TRINE: Hanne...

36:04.520 --> 36:06.876
(GASPS) My gorgeous girl.

36:07.880 --> 36:08.996
(GASPS)

36:09.240 --> 36:12.597
I don't know who you are,
but you are not my mum.

36:12.680 --> 36:13.716
- (GASPS)
- (RUMBLING)

36:13.800 --> 36:15.553
Ryan. Ryan?

36:15.640 --> 36:17.233
Ryan's not here.

36:17.560 --> 36:20.155
Wait, was he in the antizone with you?

36:20.720 --> 36:22.632
He's still in there with those things.

36:22.720 --> 36:24.598
The portal's shut,
and Ryan's still in there.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.231
Well, get it open.
We've got to help him.

36:27.320 --> 36:29.073
- No!
- What do you mean "no"?

36:29.160 --> 36:30.913
(CRASHING)

36:31.000 --> 36:33.879
This world is falling apart
because of us still being here.

36:33.960 --> 36:36.919
You and us are still
totally incompatible.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.151
Erik being here
may have been manageable.

36:39.240 --> 36:42.517
But five of us?
That's a lot more incompatible stuff.

36:42.600 --> 36:46.389
You've gone over capacity.
You need to let us go now.

36:46.480 --> 36:49.393
Is it me, or is this woman
completely mad?

36:49.480 --> 36:51.551
Grace and Trine aren't doing this.

36:51.640 --> 36:55.680
Of course they are.
They're made of Solitract energy.

36:55.920 --> 36:58.151
Hanne can sense it, why can't you?

36:58.640 --> 36:59.790
Why?

37:00.120 --> 37:02.191
What did you build this all for?

37:08.160 --> 37:10.959
Oh! I'm dumb. Of course.

37:12.080 --> 37:15.039
You want the same thing
you've always wanted.

37:15.680 --> 37:16.955
To be with us.

37:18.200 --> 37:20.271
So you've built a world
you thought we'd like,

37:20.600 --> 37:23.479
and taken forms we won't reject.

37:24.080 --> 37:25.639
Don't listen to her, love.

37:25.960 --> 37:28.520
Don't take advantage of him.
You're not Grace.

37:28.800 --> 37:31.838
The real Grace was
a beautiful, smiling superstar.

37:32.320 --> 37:34.152
And you know what she was,
above all else?

37:34.360 --> 37:37.353
She was brave, and she'd be leading
