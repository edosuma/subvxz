01:37.265 --> 01:39.233
Hey, Jimmy,

01:39.300 --> 01:41.869
check Gallery One, will ya?

01:53.647 --> 01:55.816
Hey, Jimmy?

01:55.883 --> 01:57.618
You there?

02:09.997 --> 02:11.765
(alarm blaring)

02:11.832 --> 02:13.133
(electrical buzzing)

02:14.735 --> 02:16.670
(alarm blaring)

02:21.209 --> 02:23.644
(electronic beeps)

02:27.515 --> 02:29.917
DAVID:
No sign of an outside entry.

02:29.983 --> 02:33.754
Guy must of come in during
business hours and laid in wait.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.456
He had key-card access
to the entire building,

02:35.523 --> 02:36.657
could've hid out anywhere.

02:36.724 --> 02:37.991
Any witnesses?

02:38.058 --> 02:39.193
No. He was wearing a mask.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.394
Guards didn't get a look.

02:40.461 --> 02:43.096
Well, this thing looks
pretty high-tech to me.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.698
What'd they get?

02:44.765 --> 02:46.267
Pissarro painting.

02:46.334 --> 02:49.670
-Estimated worth: 22 million.
-Yeah?

02:49.737 --> 02:52.673
What is it?

02:52.740 --> 02:54.007
Paris au Printemps,

02:54.074 --> 02:55.409
AprГ©s-Midi.

02:55.476 --> 02:56.744
You speak French?

02:56.810 --> 02:59.847
There was a girl,
once upon a time.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.215
Who's that?

03:01.282 --> 03:03.517
Museum curator, Arthur Ruiz.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.419
He was in bed
when he got the call.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.221
Excuse me, guys,
I got it, thanks.

03:07.288 --> 03:08.222
How are you doing?

03:08.289 --> 03:09.890
Don Eppes, FBI.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.425
-Hello.
-So, uh,

03:11.492 --> 03:13.193
what can you tell me
about the security here?

03:13.261 --> 03:16.697
Well, we're a small museum, but
the system's state of the art.

03:16.764 --> 03:20.768
Any changes in routine,
security guard roster changes?

03:20.834 --> 03:22.836
You're thinking one of my people
had something to do with this?

03:22.903 --> 03:24.638
Well, we're gonna
need to see a list.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.574
Any security footage
you might have.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.842
Of course, of course. That, uh,

03:28.909 --> 03:32.446
that Pissarro was
the most valuable piece we had.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.682
And frankly,
the timing couldn't be worse.

03:34.748 --> 03:35.983
And why's that?

03:36.049 --> 03:37.117
The painting was scheduled

03:37.184 --> 03:38.519
to begin a major tour
next month.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.321
Well, you got insurance, right?

03:40.388 --> 03:43.257
Actually,
the Pissarro was on loan

03:43.324 --> 03:44.358
from a private owner
in Glendale.

03:44.425 --> 03:45.893
He's out of town

03:45.959 --> 03:48.296
-on vacation.
-He must be a generous guy,

03:48.362 --> 03:50.030
loan you something
so valuable.

03:50.097 --> 03:52.466
Actually, one of the advantages
of loaning a painting

03:52.533 --> 03:55.303
to a museum is the savings
on an insurance policy.

03:55.369 --> 03:57.605
Assumption being
that a secure museum

03:57.671 --> 03:59.473
is as safe as a bank vault.

04:00.874 --> 04:04.144
I'll get you
that personnel list.

04:04.211 --> 04:06.614
So much for safe assumptions.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.316
So much.

04:09.216 --> 04:10.684
You're not leaving that?

04:10.751 --> 04:14.555
So, so I'll... I'll clean it up
when I get back.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.490
This isn't
Animal House, Charlie.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.125
Right, this is my house.

04:18.191 --> 04:20.361
Yeah, I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.595
It's not for sale.

04:21.662 --> 04:23.030
I'm not interested in
buying the house back.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.767
Just like to see you put
more into maintaining it.

04:26.834 --> 04:29.903
-It's a cup of coffee,
it's a bowl of cereal. -Yeah?

04:29.970 --> 04:31.772
What about the leak
in the attic, huh?

04:31.839 --> 04:34.442
The garage door needs
fixing, cable is out.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.209
-Cable's out?
-Yeah.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.778
Since when is the cable out?

04:37.845 --> 04:39.680
Since our resident math genius
forgot to pay the bill.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.214
Look, I don't want to be a nag,

04:41.281 --> 04:43.484
I just want you to live up
to your responsibilities.

04:43.551 --> 04:45.185
All right, all right,
I'll tell you what.

04:45.252 --> 04:46.987
-Make a list for me.
-Okay.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.656
I already did.

04:52.426 --> 04:55.429
DAVID: Running down the museum
employees, but no one's popped.

04:55.496 --> 04:56.830
And we have eyes
on the video.

04:56.897 --> 04:59.166
So this guy beat
a card-entry system,

04:59.232 --> 05:00.634
lasers and motion sensors.

05:00.701 --> 05:01.702
-He's a pro.
-Hey, guys.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.203
Which is why we have
to move fast

05:03.270 --> 05:05.839
if we have any hope of catching
him or finding this painting.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.575
Jack Tollner, from
New York, Theft Unit

05:07.641 --> 05:09.543
out of D.C.;
David Sinclair, Megan Reeves.

05:09.610 --> 05:11.645
-Morning.
-You got here pretty quick.

05:11.712 --> 05:12.946
Yeah, well, 22 million
buys you a red eye.

05:13.013 --> 05:15.082
-There you go.
-Art Theft Unit, huh?

05:15.148 --> 05:17.851
I always pictured you guys
for horn rims and bow ties.

05:17.918 --> 05:21.389
Well, Lasik surgery took care
of the horn rims, and I've

05:21.455 --> 05:22.823
never been partial to bow ties,

05:22.890 --> 05:25.393
but if you like them,
I'll go out and get myself one.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.761
Oh, what are we looking at here?

05:27.828 --> 05:30.230
Well, based on the paperwork the
museum sent over, I'm guessing

05:30.297 --> 05:31.665
a piece like this may be
difficult to move.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.767
-Because of its value?
-Because of its provenance.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.736
Provenance?

05:35.803 --> 05:37.471
The paper trail of ownership,
the documentation

05:37.538 --> 05:40.841
of a piece of art's origins--
and this Pissarro has quite

05:40.908 --> 05:42.976
-a tainted one.
-What do you mean, by tainted?

05:43.043 --> 05:45.345
This isn't the first time
this painting's been stolen.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.748
First time was by the Nazis.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.528
Nazis stole the painting?

06:00.594 --> 06:01.829
The provenance shows a pattern

06:01.895 --> 06:03.931
of Nazi looted art
that I've seen before.

06:03.997 --> 06:06.400
-Looted how?
-When the Nazis came into power,

06:06.467 --> 06:07.901
they passed laws forcing Jews

06:07.968 --> 06:09.470
to register property,
it provided them

06:09.537 --> 06:11.038
virtual "shopping lists."

06:11.104 --> 06:12.205
They looted homes by day,

06:12.272 --> 06:14.241
shipped the families off
to the camps the same night.

06:14.307 --> 06:15.843
Right and no witnesses.

06:15.909 --> 06:18.479
-Except for the few
who survived. -All right, well,

06:18.546 --> 06:19.780
what we do know is that

06:19.847 --> 06:22.015
-whoever stole the Pissarro
had skills. -Well, the Bureau

06:22.082 --> 06:24.418
has a database of career
art thieves; I'd start there.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.654
All right, I'll get on it.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.988
This is the perfect way to show

06:28.055 --> 06:29.557
that electric
and magnetic forces

06:29.623 --> 06:31.692
-are two sides of the same coin.
-Right.

06:31.759 --> 06:35.829
Hey, guys, what, uh,
what are we doing here.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.298
Oh, this screw is attached
to this battery by a magnet

06:38.365 --> 06:39.700
and the current
running through the wire

06:39.767 --> 06:41.334
is causing that screw to spin.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.103
Let me guess, show-and-tell day?

06:43.170 --> 06:45.272
Yeah, Charlie and I are
preparing a joint lecture

06:45.338 --> 06:46.540
on circular motion.

06:46.607 --> 06:50.277
Yeah, the movement is governed
by Fleming's Left Hand Rule.

06:50.343 --> 06:53.413
Our lecture's also looking
at the Coriolis force.

06:53.481 --> 06:55.315
It's the same principle that
causes hurricanes to spin

06:55.382 --> 06:57.651
-counterclockwise in our
hemisphere -So, what's happened?

06:57.718 --> 06:59.853
-What's up?
-A Pissarro was stolen

06:59.920 --> 07:03.691
last night, the father
of Impressionist painting.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.059
Pissarro, I'm sorry?

07:06.126 --> 07:07.160
At, uh, The Roland Museum,

07:07.227 --> 07:09.362
they were in and out less
than six minutes, so we got

07:09.429 --> 07:11.064
a database of art thieves,
names, M.O.s.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.066
I'm figuring you can get
through it faster than us.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.802
Maybe we could use a Quadratic
Discriminant Analysis.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.370
Right, we can Look
for a combination of attributes

07:17.437 --> 07:20.240
in this existing set of data
that match to a new set of data.

07:20.307 --> 07:21.542
Good, good.

07:21.609 --> 07:22.976
In this case,
identifying variables

07:23.043 --> 07:24.845
-of a particular theft.
-Type of art,

07:24.912 --> 07:27.615
museum, security, specifics

07:27.681 --> 07:29.449
-of the crime. -Because
there has to be something

07:29.517 --> 07:32.385
to this museum or something
about this particular piece

07:32.452 --> 07:35.122
-of art that proved attractive
to your thief, right? -Right.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.790
In a field of flowers,
we know that

07:36.857 --> 07:38.626
only certain types
of flowers attract

07:38.692 --> 07:40.127
certain types of insects.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.496
An insect will alight
on certain flowers,

07:42.563 --> 07:45.933
just like a thief will only be
attracted to certain targets,

07:45.999 --> 07:47.901
based on
specific characteristics.

07:47.968 --> 07:51.138
We know the characteristics
of this most recent theft.

07:51.204 --> 07:52.005
And we can compare

07:52.072 --> 07:54.307
that data to past thefts
using a Quadratic

07:54.374 --> 07:56.476
Discriminant Analysis, I mean,
we should be able to quickly

07:56.544 --> 07:59.079
and, you know, efficiently
boil down your suspect pool.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.781
All right, I came
to the right place.

08:00.848 --> 08:03.183
MEGAN:
I might have a suspect here.

08:03.250 --> 08:07.621
Eight years ago, Mrs. Erika
Hellman, was notified

08:07.688 --> 08:08.822
by the Art Loss Register
that the current

08:08.889 --> 08:10.658
owner of the Pissarro
was trying to sell it.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.159
-Art Loss Register?
-Database

08:12.225 --> 08:13.961
of lost or looted artworks,
I've often seen it

08:14.027 --> 08:16.463
-come into play in Holocaust
claims. -Owner's dealer

08:16.530 --> 08:18.265
checked the Pissarro
against Registry,

08:18.331 --> 08:19.066
found Mrs. Hellman's claim

08:19.132 --> 08:20.433
that it had been
looted by the Nazis.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.637
She sued the owner,
his name's Peyton Shoemaker,

08:23.704 --> 08:24.872
and she lost.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.439
Apparently,
there was insufficient

08:26.506 --> 08:28.041
-documentation.
-Not surprising.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.743
The Nazis were very good
at covering their tracks.

08:29.810 --> 08:30.844
How old is this woman?

08:30.911 --> 08:32.580
Um, according to the DMV,

08:32.646 --> 08:33.947
she's 78.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.684
There are people
she could have paid

08:36.750 --> 08:38.418
to do this.

08:38.485 --> 08:41.054
Did you know about the
Pissarro's provenance, Mr. Ruiz?

08:41.121 --> 08:42.823
Well, of course.
As the museum's

08:42.890 --> 08:44.592
curator, I have to know.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.994
Doesn't sound like
you were too troubled

08:47.060 --> 08:49.797
by the indications that it
was once looted by the Nazis.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.732
No, it was a concern.

08:51.799 --> 08:52.966
But we did our due diligence.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.735
The owner's paperwork
was in order.

08:54.802 --> 08:57.237
We were satisfied with the
assurances he provided us.

08:57.304 --> 09:01.709
Especially with the importance
of an acquisition like this one.

09:01.775 --> 09:04.745
There are many paintings

09:04.812 --> 09:06.413
with problematic
provenances, Agent Reeves.

09:06.479 --> 09:09.149
That doesn't mean they're
all Nazi looted art.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.084
Yes, but none of those
other paintings would have

09:11.151 --> 09:12.786
increased your admission revenue
by 50 percent.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.387
Look, I don't

09:14.454 --> 09:17.357
deny the Pissarro's been a boon
to a small museum like ours.

09:17.424 --> 09:20.327
Perhaps the Guggenheim can
afford to be more selective,

09:20.393 --> 09:22.429
but we can't.

09:22.495 --> 09:27.735
So, one family's misfortune
will be another man's treasure.

09:31.104 --> 09:34.341
The painting hung
in our home in Berlin.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.444
When I was little,

09:37.510 --> 09:41.815
my father used to pretend we
were the people in the painting.

09:41.882 --> 09:45.619
He always promised
that when I got old enough,

09:45.686 --> 09:48.421
he would take us
all there to Paris.

09:48.488 --> 09:52.826
Obviously, did not happen.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.461
I'm sorry for your loss,

09:54.527 --> 10:01.201
and I hope you understand why I
would have to ask you about it.

10:01.268 --> 10:08.008
Well, I hate to disappoint you,
but you, you have the wrong man.

10:08.075 --> 10:12.379
Naturally, I would love
to have it back again.

10:12.445 --> 10:18.318
You see, the Nazis,
they took everything.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.320
Not just the painting.

10:20.387 --> 10:24.424
I don't have one
photograph of my family.

10:24.491 --> 10:28.996
But when I look
at the Pissarro...

10:29.062 --> 10:35.335
I-I feel as if I was
seeing them all again.

10:35.402 --> 10:39.039
You have any idea
who might have taken it?

10:39.106 --> 10:40.974
(door opens)

10:41.041 --> 10:44.144
No, but we know who stole it
70 years ago.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.645
-Sorry, Nana, traffic on
the freeway. -Yeah.

10:45.713 --> 10:47.347
-I got here as soon as I could.
-Oh, thank you.

10:47.414 --> 10:48.515
-Hi.
-This is my

10:48.581 --> 10:50.884
grandson, Joel. This is Agent

10:50.951 --> 10:52.385
Eppes, Don Eppes.

10:52.452 --> 10:53.420
FBI.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.857
From what I understand,
a federal court

10:56.924 --> 10:58.091
denied your grandmother's claim?

10:58.158 --> 10:59.459
They used the law against her,

10:59.526 --> 11:01.995
same way they used it against
my great-grandfather in 1938.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.764
We just didn't have the money

11:03.831 --> 11:05.398
to continue the fight.

11:05.465 --> 11:06.533
Mm-hmm.

11:06.599 --> 11:07.768
What my grandson is saying

11:07.835 --> 11:10.003
is that we did not lose
the painting

11:10.070 --> 11:12.105
on the merits of the case.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.507
We lost it

11:14.574 --> 11:16.710
because my memory is failing.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.678
My grandmother is the only

11:18.746 --> 11:20.680
living witness
who ever saw the Pissarro

11:20.748 --> 11:22.015
hanging in her father's home.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.785
The rest of the family
were murdered by the Nazis.

11:24.852 --> 11:27.087
The court would not accept

11:27.154 --> 11:29.957
the failing memory
of an old woman.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.962
I had seven
sisters and brothers.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.698
You have family?

11:38.766 --> 11:40.901
Yeah, I have a father
and a brother.

11:40.968 --> 11:43.771
My mother passed away
a few years ago.

11:45.572 --> 11:47.808
You know what loss is, then.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.244
Well, I-I, um...

11:51.311 --> 11:53.947
Look, I'm going to need
to take a look

11:54.014 --> 11:55.916
at your phone
and your bank records.

11:55.983 --> 11:58.886
Now, of course, this would
be with your consent.

11:58.952 --> 12:00.453
Maybe you'd like
to take a painting.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.455
Joel, please.

12:02.522 --> 12:05.225
I did not steal the Pissarro.

12:05.292 --> 12:06.927
Though I admit,

12:06.994 --> 12:09.596
it has run through my mind
many times.

12:09.662 --> 12:13.100
Surely you can understand this.

12:13.166 --> 12:16.103
Family is our anchor
to life.

12:16.169 --> 12:19.206
We lose it, we're adrift.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.211
You have no idea what it's like

12:24.277 --> 12:29.482
to be the only survivor
of your family...

12:31.551 --> 12:33.887
...and to have no idea why.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.295
LARRY:
I find this whole

12:42.362 --> 12:46.333
Nazi association just
so sadly ironic.

12:46.399 --> 12:47.334
How do you mean?

12:47.400 --> 12:50.670
Okay, just observe
this perspective.

12:50.737 --> 12:53.606
Now, most artists at the time,
they painted street scenes

12:53.673 --> 12:54.707
from the street level.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.276
AMITA:
Yeah, but this was painted

12:56.343 --> 12:57.377
from a rooftop.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.512
Why? Artistic choice?

12:59.579 --> 13:01.114
Survival. Pissarro was Jewish.

13:01.181 --> 13:04.351
He was living in Paris at
the time of the Dreyfus Affair.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.686
Anti-Semitic mobs were
roaming the streets.

13:06.753 --> 13:08.055
He feared for his life.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.657
How do you know so much
about Pissarro, Larry?

13:10.723 --> 13:12.926
Oh, my father was a painter.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.628
Really? You never told us that.

13:15.695 --> 13:17.797
It's not a memory
that I gladly inhabit.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.799
Why, all this went
under the heading of,

13:19.867 --> 13:22.602
what, parental disappointment?

13:22.669 --> 13:24.304
He wanted you to be a painter?

13:24.371 --> 13:27.740
He wanted me to see the world
the way he saw it.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.509
Which is the folly
of fatherhood.

13:29.576 --> 13:32.079
Tell me about it.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.246
Why?

13:33.313 --> 13:35.115
Are you and your dad
having problems?

13:35.182 --> 13:37.117
You know, he's been
getting on my case

13:37.184 --> 13:38.585
about how I maintain my house.

13:38.651 --> 13:39.652
LARRY:
Now you see

13:39.719 --> 13:42.122
why I sold my house, okay?
Renounce all worldly cares

13:42.189 --> 13:43.857
-for the more sublime pursuits.
-(computer beeps)

13:43.924 --> 13:48.428
I think we've got something from
the FBI's Art Theft Database.

13:49.997 --> 13:52.900
Three similar robberies.

13:52.966 --> 13:55.502
Analyzing past thefts
for common variables

13:55.568 --> 13:57.104
with our current crime,

13:57.170 --> 13:59.439
I've succeeded in identifying
three suspects--

13:59.506 --> 14:01.074
Michael Ness,

14:01.141 --> 14:02.976
Ben Larkin,
and this is Ronald Wheeler.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.078
TOLLNER:
Ness is in a prison in Turkey.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.047
Now, there's a good time.

14:07.114 --> 14:08.381
And I think Larkin's dead.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.951
Yeah, murdered
three years ago in Kiev.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.752
All right,
so we focus on Wheeler.

14:12.819 --> 14:15.188
TOLLNER:
Wheeler's Canadian.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.925
Database has a current address
for Wheeler in Toronto.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.227
You know your art thieves, huh?

14:20.293 --> 14:22.429
I'm impressed with how quickly
you combed through our database.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.264
DAVID:
Homeland Security has no record

14:24.331 --> 14:25.465
of Wheeler entering the country.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.267
All right. Well, no
surprise there, right?

14:27.334 --> 14:29.269
No. He'll be traveling
on a false passport.

14:29.336 --> 14:30.470
DON:
All right, let's get

14:30.537 --> 14:31.704
his picture out
to everyone, right?

14:31.771 --> 14:32.705
The hotels, airports,

14:32.772 --> 14:33.606
train stations, you know?

14:33.673 --> 14:35.675
And I'd start with
the upscale ones.

14:35.742 --> 14:36.977
And within the last week.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.611
You got a $22 million painting,

14:38.678 --> 14:41.081
you're not going
to stay in some dump.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.083
MAN:
He said his name was Gautier.

14:43.150 --> 14:46.086
His real name is Wheeler.

14:46.153 --> 14:49.489
Good morning, Mr. Gautier.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.092
Mr. Gautier is not
entertaining visitors.

14:52.159 --> 14:54.995
We're going to need
you to stay back.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.167
Ronald Wheeler, FBI.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.302
We want to talk with you.

15:11.511 --> 15:12.912
Clear.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.586
You smell gunpowder?

15:23.423 --> 15:27.627
We just went way past
stealing high-end art.

15:27.694 --> 15:31.298
Somebody's willing
to kill for this painting.

15:36.869 --> 15:39.006
Mrs. Hellman's story's
not that unusual.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.640
Similar thing
happened to a woman

15:40.707 --> 15:42.375
who got several Klimt
paintings back

15:42.442 --> 15:44.144
from an Austrian
national museum.

15:44.211 --> 15:45.278
They fought her for years.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.147
I mean, she said
it's the only thing

15:47.214 --> 15:48.281
that's left from her family.

15:48.348 --> 15:49.882
MEGAN:
I guess the federal court

15:49.949 --> 15:51.184
didn't see it that way, though.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.485
Not for the Hellmans anyway.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.421
Or the owner,
this Mr. Shoemaker,

15:54.487 --> 15:57.757
just has more bucks to throw
at a high-priced legal team.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.259
Is he back from his vacation?

15:59.326 --> 16:01.628
Why? Do you think
he stole his own painting?

16:01.694 --> 16:05.765
Look, I mean, he tries
to sell it and gets a lawsuit.

16:05.832 --> 16:08.001
Right. Maybe
an insurance company

16:08.068 --> 16:10.103
won't ask the same questions?

16:10.970 --> 16:12.605
When did you get home?

16:12.672 --> 16:14.307
Uh, about an hour ago.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.043
Didn't you hear me
working outside?

16:16.109 --> 16:17.410
No, I didn't.

16:17.477 --> 16:20.213
The re-circ pump on
the koi pond's on the fritz.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.015
Yeah? Fish are okay?

16:22.082 --> 16:23.450
Yeah, thanks to me
playing bucket brigade.

16:23.516 --> 16:26.053
Don't you remember I told you
that that pump needed servicing?

16:26.119 --> 16:27.587
The list? Yeah, right.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.489
I'm sorry. I've been busy.
I'm busy.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.424
Yeah, well, I've been
busy, too, Charlie.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.126
You know, at your age,
I had a house,

16:33.193 --> 16:34.861
a wife, and two kids
to take care of.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.663
Any murders to solve?

16:36.729 --> 16:37.797
No, seriously.

16:37.864 --> 16:41.268
Any life-altering mathematical
advances to conceive of?

16:41.334 --> 16:43.536
Oh, I see-- the same old story,
the same excuse for everything.

16:43.603 --> 16:44.871
I don't need... You know what?

16:44.937 --> 16:47.907
I don't need a lecture
on how to run my own home,

16:47.974 --> 16:49.276
much less my life.

17:05.158 --> 17:06.959
The Pissarro was inherited.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.230
My father's the one
who made the original purchase.

17:10.297 --> 17:11.364
Any idea from who?

17:11.431 --> 17:12.832
A reputable dealer in Paris.

17:12.899 --> 17:14.301
It was right after the war.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.537
My father was in the Army
on leave in Paris.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.072
He stopped by a shop,

17:19.139 --> 17:20.807
saw the painting, fell in love.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.041
MEGAN:
And did he

17:22.109 --> 17:23.310
question its origin?

17:23.376 --> 17:25.078
After the war, it was difficult

17:25.145 --> 17:26.379
to know where anything
came from.

17:26.446 --> 17:28.481
So many had died or fled.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.851
Well, how hard did you think
he, uh, actually tried?

17:31.918 --> 17:36.123
My father bought the painting
from a legitimate dealer.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.857
I have the paperwork.

17:37.924 --> 17:39.092
He paid a fair price.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.327
What, $12,000?

17:40.393 --> 17:43.230
$12,000 was a great amount
of money in those days.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.132
Well, still, it's
nowhere near the 20 million

17:45.198 --> 17:47.234
you were trying
to get eight years ago.

17:49.136 --> 17:51.238
DON:
I'm just curious-- does it...

17:51.304 --> 17:53.540
even bother you at all knowing
where it came from?

17:53.606 --> 17:56.042
Well, the fact is, Idon'tknow
where it comes from.

17:56.109 --> 17:58.345
-No one does. -But they have
their suspicions, don't they?

17:58.411 --> 18:00.613
And I understand with the taint
on the painting,

18:00.680 --> 18:02.849
it'll be almost impossible
to get the price

18:02.915 --> 18:03.916
you're asking.

18:03.983 --> 18:06.219
I'm not sure I understand
where this is going.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.987
The Pissarro is insured...

18:08.054 --> 18:09.189
For $22 million.

18:09.256 --> 18:12.692
If you're suggesting what
I think you're suggesting...

18:13.893 --> 18:15.828
Yeah?

18:15.895 --> 18:17.764
I feel bad for Mrs. Hellman,
I really do,

18:17.830 --> 18:19.366
but the court heard
all the evidence.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.635
That woman did not stand
a chance.

18:22.702 --> 18:25.272
Which is precisely why
I offered her a settlement.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.641
30% of the proceeds

18:28.708 --> 18:31.110
of any sale I made
if she agreed

18:31.178 --> 18:33.780
to drop her claim
against the painting.

18:33.846 --> 18:34.847
And she refused?

18:34.914 --> 18:36.082
Her grandson.

18:36.149 --> 18:37.784
He threw my attorney's offer

18:37.850 --> 18:39.986
in my face.

18:40.052 --> 18:42.322
You know, I had my father's
honor to consider.

18:42.389 --> 18:44.157
I had to match it

18:44.224 --> 18:47.327
against the compromised memory
of an elderly woman.

18:47.394 --> 18:50.797
If it were your father,
who would you believe?

18:54.934 --> 18:56.869
(knock at door)

18:58.771 --> 19:01.808
Hey. Ooh,
it looks pretty serious.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.243
Huh? No. Oh, no. Come in.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.444
-Yeah?
-No, actually, no.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.546
I'm just, uh...
I'm balancing my checkbook.

19:06.613 --> 19:07.480
The bank called.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.816
I guess I overdrew
paying some bills.

19:09.882 --> 19:10.683
Oh, don't say it.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.219
-What?
-I'm a math genius,

19:12.285 --> 19:14.020
and I can't even
balance my own checkbook.

19:14.086 --> 19:15.922
Right. I got
an earful from Dad.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.123
I didn't say anything.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.525
I should have known, you know,

19:18.591 --> 19:20.327
this arrangement
of dad living with me

19:20.393 --> 19:22.862
would just end up driving us
both completely insane.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.731
Nah. I sort of get it now.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.833
I mean,
why you bought the house.

19:26.899 --> 19:29.736
It's, like, it gives you
an anchor, you know?

19:29.802 --> 19:33.406
I mean, where you grew up,
your family.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.509
What's up?

19:36.576 --> 19:40.112
Why do you think
we were never religious?

19:40.179 --> 19:43.115
Mom wanted a Christmas tree.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.317
Yeah, exactly.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.185
I mean, it's funny, right?

19:46.253 --> 19:48.921
This case got you thinking
about that?

19:48.988 --> 19:51.991
Yeah, a little bit.

19:52.058 --> 19:54.727
Actually, I need some help
with this, Charlie.

19:54.794 --> 19:57.597
Oh, great, and Dad wonders
why I can't get any work done.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.766
Well, it's just I'm trying
to figure out where,

19:59.832 --> 20:02.134
you know, whoever stole
the Pissarro would go next.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.403
With Wheeler dead...

20:03.470 --> 20:05.538
I imagine the options
are pretty limited.

20:05.605 --> 20:06.539
Totally.

20:06.606 --> 20:09.376
But I do suspect
that there are only a few places

20:09.442 --> 20:10.810
that this painting might end up,

20:10.877 --> 20:13.212
and that can be charted
with a diffusion map

20:13.280 --> 20:14.814
using a network
diffusion proba...

20:14.881 --> 20:16.549
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just slow down.

20:16.616 --> 20:17.684
It's like a vehicle

20:17.750 --> 20:20.420
traveling along
a network of roads.

20:20.487 --> 20:22.555
You know, cars can
go anywhere, right?

20:22.622 --> 20:24.257
But a commercial truck
is limited

20:24.324 --> 20:25.992
to how many routes
it can travel,

20:26.058 --> 20:28.127
and if that truck is carrying
hazardous material,

20:28.194 --> 20:30.463
well, then, the network becomes
even more restricted.

20:30.530 --> 20:31.831
If it's carrying nuclear waste,

20:31.898 --> 20:33.566
the network becomes
even more limited,

20:33.633 --> 20:35.435
and there are only
a few destinations--

20:35.502 --> 20:37.370
repositories--
where nuclear waste can go.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.971
It's the same with the Pissarro.

20:39.038 --> 20:41.808
There are only a few places
that it can travel.

20:41.874 --> 20:44.677
Shoemaker might be right
on target with the grandson.

20:44.744 --> 20:47.280
I have phone logs
going back to the time

20:47.347 --> 20:48.981
that Shoemaker made
the settlement offer.

20:49.048 --> 20:50.283
And?

20:50.350 --> 20:52.084
Mrs. Hellman's grandson
made several calls

20:52.151 --> 20:55.054
to a private investigator
specializing in the recovery

20:55.121 --> 20:57.156
of stolen artwork, Peter Tucci.

20:57.223 --> 20:58.558
Why do I know that name?

20:58.625 --> 21:00.327
He has, uh, pending charges
in Istanbul

21:00.393 --> 21:01.561
related to the crime

21:01.628 --> 21:04.163
that Michael Ness
is doing time for in Turkey.

21:04.230 --> 21:05.965
Ness is one of the art thieves

21:06.032 --> 21:07.834
that Charlie pulled
off the database.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.101
Yeah, check this out.

21:09.168 --> 21:11.538
Uh, the museum records its, uh,
security footage digitally.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.341
I pulled an MPEG file from
about three months ago.

21:14.407 --> 21:15.942
Nice.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.078
MEGAN:
Mrs. Hellman's

21:19.145 --> 21:20.212
grandson?

21:20.279 --> 21:21.448
Is he casing the place?

21:21.514 --> 21:23.583
He contacted Tucci
three years ago.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.352
About hiring Ness
to rip off the Pissarro.

21:25.418 --> 21:26.619
TOLLNER:
But when Ness

21:26.686 --> 21:28.821
got caught,
he couldn't do the job.

21:28.888 --> 21:31.824
Wow. Joel Hellman really
couldn't take no for an answer.

21:38.365 --> 21:40.166
I don't know a guy
named Ronald Wheeler

21:40.232 --> 21:42.101
or how he ended up dead.

21:42.168 --> 21:44.036
Have a seat.

21:44.103 --> 21:45.905
I haven't done anything.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.940
Look, tell me about
your relationship

21:48.007 --> 21:49.542
with Peter Tucci.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.044
That was over three years ago.

21:52.111 --> 21:55.448
Right around the time
the courts decided against you.

21:55.515 --> 21:58.084
(sighs):
I lost my cool.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.186
It was a stupid thing to do.

22:00.252 --> 22:01.388
Look, I understand how you feel.

22:01.454 --> 22:02.789
I mean with your
grandmother and all

22:02.855 --> 22:04.524
and then not being
able to help her.

22:04.591 --> 22:05.692
They embarrassed her.

22:05.758 --> 22:07.527
They brought in doctors
and tested her memory

22:07.594 --> 22:09.128
and made her live
through things that...

22:09.195 --> 22:11.531
That's you at the museum,

22:11.598 --> 22:13.466
taken three months ago.

22:15.468 --> 22:17.804
I go a lot.

22:17.870 --> 22:20.507
I don't know, somehow
it made me feel...

22:20.573 --> 22:22.141
better to be close to it.

22:22.208 --> 22:24.276
Not as good as having it

22:24.343 --> 22:26.012
would make you feel
though, right?

22:26.078 --> 22:27.914
No.

22:27.980 --> 22:30.917
I told you, I haven't
done anything.

22:35.154 --> 22:36.923
So what do you think?

22:36.989 --> 22:38.391
Well, I think
he thought about it,

22:38.458 --> 22:39.759
but I don't think he did it.

22:39.826 --> 22:41.861
He didn't make any real efforts
to cover his tracks either.

22:41.928 --> 22:43.329
Well, then we're back
to the owner,

22:43.396 --> 22:45.097
Shoemaker,
and the insurance scam.

22:45.164 --> 22:47.900
It's a nice theory, but so far
I can't find a paper trail

22:47.967 --> 22:49.569
between Shoemaker
and our thief, Wheeler.

22:49.636 --> 22:51.571
I mean, there's no payments
to a middle man,

22:51.638 --> 22:52.739
there's nothing.

22:52.805 --> 22:54.441
That painting's
got to be somewhere.

22:54.507 --> 22:57.043
AMITA: Yeah, the numbers
are staggering.

22:57.109 --> 23:00.447
The Nazis looted hundreds
of thousands of artworks.

23:00.513 --> 23:03.115
Nearly a fifth of all European
art at the time.

23:03.182 --> 23:05.184
Yeah, there's still
a lot out there, you know?

23:05.251 --> 23:06.553
Museums, dealers, collectors...

23:06.619 --> 23:09.689
Yeah, it's just appalling--
blood trade.

23:09.756 --> 23:11.458
I am starting to see
a pattern here.

23:11.524 --> 23:13.560
You know, the heaviest flow
of art

23:13.626 --> 23:14.961
running along these networks.

23:15.027 --> 23:17.196
With China being
a prime destination.

23:17.263 --> 23:18.130
So we should start

23:18.197 --> 23:20.433
concentrating
on networks supplying to China.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.702
(cell phone ringing)

23:25.004 --> 23:25.738
(phone beeps off)

23:25.805 --> 23:27.273
Wouldn't be Dad, would it?

23:27.339 --> 23:28.641
It's a standoff.

23:29.709 --> 23:30.910
Hey, here's another chestnut

23:30.977 --> 23:33.480
from my rather exhaustive study
of the great artists.

23:33.546 --> 23:34.814
Did you know

23:34.881 --> 23:37.416
that Monet's father wanted
him to be a grocer?

23:37.484 --> 23:40.219
Oh, yeah? Hmm.

23:40.286 --> 23:41.488
Good thing he didn't listen.

23:41.554 --> 23:42.955
Well, fathers imposing
their wills

23:43.022 --> 23:46.192
on their sons... I tell ya,
that is the stuff of legend.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.359
CHARLIE:
This is hardly so grand.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.095
I mean, the last
message he left me

23:49.161 --> 23:51.363
equated my refusal
to take out the garbage

23:51.430 --> 23:52.465
with my supposed
commitment-phobia

23:52.532 --> 23:54.701
and my failure to settle down.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.970
There might be
some truth in that.

23:59.138 --> 24:00.372
What?

24:00.439 --> 24:01.508
Uh, I'm just saying...

24:01.574 --> 24:04.511
Where were we? China?

24:04.577 --> 24:06.846
Uh, yeah...

24:06.913 --> 24:08.380
(muttering)

24:08.447 --> 24:11.083
DON:
That smells good.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.852
Where's Charlie?

24:12.919 --> 24:14.987
I don't know,
working late I guess.

24:15.054 --> 24:16.523
Or hiding from you.

24:16.589 --> 24:19.125
He's been complaining?

24:19.191 --> 24:20.527
You been giving him a hard time?

24:20.593 --> 24:23.062
Hey, he owns the place,
you know.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.898
Remember when I was looking
for a place of my own?

24:25.965 --> 24:27.433
And I thought
that staying on here

24:27.500 --> 24:28.801
was gonna keep me
from moving on.

24:28.868 --> 24:30.469
What does this have
to do with Charlie?

24:30.537 --> 24:31.804
Well, he just
comes and he goes.

24:31.871 --> 24:33.706
He has no idea how
to maintain a home.

24:33.773 --> 24:35.608
Dad, the guy's got
a lot on his plate.

24:35.675 --> 24:36.809
Hey look, I don't want
to be a pest.

24:36.876 --> 24:38.745
I just want to make sure
that when the time comes,

24:38.811 --> 24:40.580
he knows how to take care
of his own house--

24:40.647 --> 24:42.448
his own family if
he ever has one.

24:42.515 --> 24:43.550
Well, talk to him.

24:43.616 --> 24:44.851
I mean, you can't just

24:44.917 --> 24:47.086
ride him like he's a little kid.

24:47.153 --> 24:49.556
Are you referring
to my failures with you?

24:49.622 --> 24:53.425
Me? I'm a lost cause, pal.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.762
What's up?

24:55.828 --> 24:56.929
You had a tough day?

24:56.996 --> 24:58.731
You know I had to interview

24:58.798 --> 25:02.635
that Holocaust survivor
yesterday, her grandson today.

25:02.702 --> 25:04.771
-Oh, about that painting, huh?
-I felt weird

25:04.837 --> 25:06.305
'cause nobody believes
the woman; it's like

25:06.372 --> 25:08.641
her life never existed
because there's nobody left

25:08.708 --> 25:11.177
-who remembers it.
-Yeah.

25:12.378 --> 25:14.213
You remember
my mother's cousin, Anna?

25:14.280 --> 25:17.183
-Yeah, I mean... -Yeah, it was
the same way with her.

25:17.249 --> 25:18.317
She got out before the war,

25:18.384 --> 25:20.920
but she spent her whole life--
the whole rest of her life--

25:20.987 --> 25:22.488
searching for her people.

25:22.555 --> 25:23.590
Can you imagine that?

25:23.656 --> 25:26.092
I mean, living that life
going through all that?

25:26.158 --> 25:29.862
This woman finds a piece
and it gets taken away again.

25:32.599 --> 25:33.900
Let me get you a plate.

25:35.802 --> 25:38.470
Hey, did your mom's cousin
ever find anyone?

25:38.537 --> 25:40.139
No, not a single soul.

25:46.579 --> 25:50.482
LARRY: Oh, still taking your
meals outside the home, I see.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.451
CHARLIE:
Still brown bagging it.

25:52.518 --> 25:54.353
Is this some of your work?

25:54.420 --> 25:58.157
It's my submission for entry
into art school.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.893
One of the many life steps
I never took.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.762
-You're pretty good.
-Don't mistake

26:02.829 --> 26:04.563
technical ability
for originality.

26:04.631 --> 26:06.365
Almost every one of these

26:06.432 --> 26:08.234
is a copy of a masterwork.

26:08.300 --> 26:09.769
My father insisted that before

26:09.836 --> 26:12.905
I attempt anything original,
I had to understand

26:12.972 --> 26:14.774
those who came before me.

26:14.841 --> 26:16.643
I mean, what is all this

26:16.709 --> 26:19.646
red marginalia here?

26:19.712 --> 26:21.280
When network analysis
came up empty,

26:21.347 --> 26:23.115
I found these leads to China.

26:23.182 --> 26:25.284
Still no sign of the Pissarro
so I must've miscalculated.

26:25.351 --> 26:28.520
You know, some of the greatest
errors in cosmology

26:28.587 --> 26:30.222
have come not from poor math,

26:30.289 --> 26:31.658
but from poor assumptions.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.392
What poor assumptions
am I making?

26:33.459 --> 26:36.495
Well, current wisdom holds
that the picture's

26:36.562 --> 26:39.632
Nazi associations
have compromised

26:39.699 --> 26:41.901
its potential for sale
on the black market.

26:41.968 --> 26:44.403
Compromised yeah,
but eliminated no.

26:44.470 --> 26:45.337
Yet you can find

26:45.404 --> 26:47.339
no market to which
you can trace a sale.

26:47.406 --> 26:49.608
China seemed the best bet.
Don came up empty.

26:49.676 --> 26:50.810
Perhaps this Pissarro

26:50.877 --> 26:54.380
is not for sale anywhere
because for some reason,

26:54.446 --> 26:56.348
it's simply not saleable.

26:56.415 --> 26:58.685
Even with the taint,
it's still worth millions.

26:58.751 --> 27:00.552
Why wouldn't it be "saleable"?

27:00.619 --> 27:02.789
No idea.

27:05.491 --> 27:08.160
I'm leaving.

27:12.765 --> 27:14.901
All right.

27:17.003 --> 27:18.604
CHARLIE:
I think I've figured out

27:18.671 --> 27:21.674
why you haven't been able
to find the Pissarro.

27:22.742 --> 27:23.843
Using a computer program

27:23.910 --> 27:25.611
that analyzes fine art paintings

27:25.678 --> 27:26.946
from enhanced photographs.

27:27.013 --> 27:30.516
Now uses two criteria:
craquelure...

27:30.582 --> 27:31.450
Craquelure?

27:31.517 --> 27:33.085
It's a fancy word
for the cracks that form

27:33.152 --> 27:34.086
on the surface of a painting.

27:34.153 --> 27:36.522
And those cracks
form patterns,

27:36.588 --> 27:37.690
which will give us an idea

27:37.757 --> 27:38.825
of where and when a work
was painted

27:38.891 --> 27:40.827
because the pattern depends

27:40.893 --> 27:42.128
on the artist's materials:

27:42.194 --> 27:44.263
the paint, the brush...
even the canvas.

27:44.330 --> 27:47.533
A painter in 15th century
Florence used different

27:47.599 --> 27:50.703
materials than a painter
in 17th century London.

27:50.770 --> 27:53.139
Or a painter
in 19th century Paris.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.842
See, different materials
and the vagaries of time

27:55.908 --> 27:58.044
create specific
craquelure patterns

27:58.110 --> 28:01.047
which we can analyze using
mathematical models.

28:01.113 --> 28:03.415
-You said there were
two criteria. -Right, well...

28:03.482 --> 28:06.252
The analysis also
looks at visual style--

28:06.318 --> 28:08.087
the artist's actual
brushstrokes.

28:08.154 --> 28:10.089
-Like a fingerprint?
-More like a signature.

28:10.156 --> 28:12.458
See, with currency,
I used a wavelet analysis.

28:12.524 --> 28:15.561
But with paintings,
I can use a more sophisticated

28:15.627 --> 28:17.029
curvelet analysis,

28:17.096 --> 28:19.631
allowing us to look at the art
in three dimensions.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.433
Using curvelet analysis,

28:21.500 --> 28:24.036
we can measure
the contours and the depth

28:24.103 --> 28:25.772
of an artist's brushstrokes,

28:25.838 --> 28:27.907
giving us a mathematical
expression

28:27.974 --> 28:30.409
of the artist's
unique signature...

28:30.476 --> 28:32.311
which we then use
to evaluate other works

28:32.378 --> 28:34.546
attributed to the artist
to see if the same hand

28:34.613 --> 28:36.983
did, in fact, paint them all.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.685
Enhancing the museum catalogue
photo of the Pissarro,

28:39.752 --> 28:41.187
I ran both analyses

28:41.253 --> 28:43.189
and compared it
to other Pissarros

28:43.255 --> 28:45.591
from museums around the world.

28:45.657 --> 28:47.994
The results are undeniable.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.262
This isn't a Pissarro.

28:52.932 --> 28:54.901
It's a fake.

29:00.372 --> 29:02.108
The Pissarro a forgery?

29:02.174 --> 29:03.976
It's not possible.

29:04.043 --> 29:05.311
Our math consultant

29:05.377 --> 29:07.579
did an extensive
analysis, Mr. Ruiz.

29:07.646 --> 29:08.647
From a photograph.

29:08.714 --> 29:11.317
-With a computer's enhancement.
-I'm sorry,

29:11.383 --> 29:13.986
but whatever consultant
you used is mistaken.

29:14.053 --> 29:16.989
I'm afraid that's
not really possible.

29:17.056 --> 29:18.057
Well, it has to be.

29:18.124 --> 29:19.091
This painting underwent

29:19.158 --> 29:20.492
an extensive
authentication process

29:20.559 --> 29:23.062
-when it arrived here a year
and a half ago. -Then what about

29:23.129 --> 29:25.697
a switch? What if someone
changed the painting

29:25.764 --> 29:26.899
-since the authentication?
-How?

29:26.966 --> 29:28.700
Hmm? When?

29:28.767 --> 29:30.136
I don't work at a museum,

29:30.202 --> 29:32.304
but have you cleaned
the painting in the past

29:32.371 --> 29:33.405
year and a half?

29:33.472 --> 29:36.375
Under the strict supervision
of the museum conservator.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.610
Who also, by the way,
performed the authentication.

29:38.677 --> 29:41.113
And that would have been done
on the premises, correct?

29:41.180 --> 29:44.984
Yes. In our restoration
department.

29:49.188 --> 29:50.622
The Pissarro was taken down

29:50.689 --> 29:52.825
June 3rd for a cleaning.

29:52.892 --> 29:54.126
Who did the work?

29:54.193 --> 29:55.794
Me.

29:55.862 --> 29:58.965
And you also performed
the authentication

29:59.031 --> 30:00.867
on the Pissarro when
it first arrived here?

30:00.933 --> 30:02.268
-That's right.
-And you're certain

30:02.334 --> 30:04.937
that the painting you cleaned
on June 3rd is the same one

30:05.004 --> 30:07.039
you authenticated 18 months ago.

30:07.106 --> 30:08.975
Patrick has been
with me 20 years.

30:09.041 --> 30:11.277
I trust his judgment completely.

30:11.343 --> 30:13.279
So, there's no chance
you missed something?

30:13.345 --> 30:15.081
This painting was the most
important piece

30:15.147 --> 30:17.216
we've ever displayed here.

30:17.283 --> 30:18.317
Mr. Holden?

30:19.751 --> 30:21.153
I'm certain that the painting

30:21.220 --> 30:24.090
was the same one that I examined
a year and a half ago.

30:25.024 --> 30:27.326
You have your answer.

30:32.698 --> 30:34.066
Is it you that also does

30:34.133 --> 30:36.435
the museum catalogues,
Mr. Holden.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.170
For every exhibition.

30:40.006 --> 30:42.008
When was the photograph
of the Pissarro taken?

30:42.074 --> 30:44.944
I don't know.

30:45.011 --> 30:46.145
What do you mean
you don't know?

30:46.212 --> 30:47.914
This particular photograph
was furnished

30:47.980 --> 30:49.248
by the owner.

30:49.315 --> 30:50.582
Peyton Shoemaker
gave you the photograph?

30:50.649 --> 30:52.484
Once in a while an owner loaning

30:52.551 --> 30:53.953
a painting does
accompany the piece

30:54.020 --> 30:56.255
with his own photographic
documentation.

30:58.991 --> 31:00.492
MEGAN:
So Shoemaker provided

31:00.559 --> 31:04.396
the photo when he first loaned
the piece to the museum.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.265
The same photograph
your brother used

31:06.332 --> 31:07.733
to determine it was a forgery.

31:07.799 --> 31:10.769
Okay, so we're saying, what,
the stolen one was a fake.

31:10.836 --> 31:12.338
But did Shoemaker know it?

31:12.404 --> 31:14.073
He may even be the one
who had it made.

31:14.140 --> 31:15.141
Forgery of his own painting?

31:15.207 --> 31:16.142
Owners often have forgeries made

31:16.208 --> 31:17.977
to protect their art
against theft.

31:18.044 --> 31:19.345
But maybe Shoemaker was afraid

31:19.411 --> 31:20.980
he'd lose his painting
another way.

31:21.047 --> 31:22.348
The Hellmans.

31:22.414 --> 31:24.416
TOLLNER: Those type of claims
never really go away.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.518
Collectors tend to shy
away from paintings

31:26.585 --> 31:28.887
with questionable histories
for that very reason.

31:28.955 --> 31:30.189
In other words,
if the Hellmans

31:30.256 --> 31:32.358
ever find more evidence
to support their claim...

31:32.424 --> 31:34.126
They could go right
back to court.

31:34.193 --> 31:36.795
He creates a fake
to hedge his bet.

31:36.862 --> 31:37.930
Then he loaned it

31:37.997 --> 31:39.598
to the museum to get the break

31:39.665 --> 31:40.599
in the insurance premium.

31:40.666 --> 31:42.068
Shoemaker might even be trying

31:42.134 --> 31:43.435
to pull off a double scam--

31:43.502 --> 31:45.237
have the fake one stolen
for insurance, right,

31:45.304 --> 31:47.506
and then sell the real one later
on the sly.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.409
Why steal back
the fake Pissarro now?

31:50.476 --> 31:52.444
I mean, it's been hanging
on the museum wall

31:52.511 --> 31:54.013
-for a year and a half.
-Hey, wait,

31:54.080 --> 31:55.247
what'd that guy,
that curator guy say...

31:55.314 --> 31:58.584
-it was going on tour?
-Next month.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.552
Which would have meant
another authentication.

32:00.619 --> 32:02.788
Fool me once shame on
you, fool me twice...

32:02.854 --> 32:05.791
Now, the question is...

32:05.857 --> 32:07.659
where is the real Pissarro?

32:07.726 --> 32:09.295
Right.

32:11.063 --> 32:12.898
You can add,
but you can't hide.

32:12.965 --> 32:14.833
What's broken?

32:14.900 --> 32:18.270
I've come with a peace offering.

32:18.337 --> 32:19.305
French dip.

32:19.371 --> 32:22.408
Thank you, but you
didn't have to do that.

32:22.474 --> 32:24.977
There are a lot of things
I don't have to do, Charlie,

32:25.044 --> 32:26.678
but I just do them
because I want to.

32:26.745 --> 32:29.881
Just feel like you worry
about me too much, Dad.

32:29.948 --> 32:33.085
Charlie, look, you're a grown
man, but you're still my son

32:33.152 --> 32:35.421
and I'm still your father.

32:35.487 --> 32:36.388
Okay,

32:36.455 --> 32:38.857
it-it's not
about the house or chores.

32:38.924 --> 32:43.229
It's, uh, it's about...
accepting responsibility.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.031
(slams book shut)

32:45.097 --> 32:49.535
Dad, I'm a... I'm a full-tenured
professor at one of the most

32:49.601 --> 32:51.670
prestigious universities
in this country.

32:51.737 --> 32:53.672
How do you think I got here,
by slacking off?

32:53.739 --> 32:56.542
You can do the math, Charlie,
we all know that,

32:56.608 --> 32:59.011
but, uh, sometime, you're going
to want more for your life.

32:59.078 --> 33:01.913
I know you can't see that
right now, but...

33:01.980 --> 33:04.950
sometime, God willing, you're
going to have to make a choice

33:05.017 --> 33:06.252
between one of your algorithms

33:06.318 --> 33:08.520
and one of your kids
upstairs with the flu.

33:09.421 --> 33:11.257
I have a kid with the flu now?

33:11.323 --> 33:16.028
Charlie, I look at Larry,
you know, an-and I respect him,

33:16.095 --> 33:17.896
but look at him--
he's all alone.

33:17.963 --> 33:19.598
I mean, he sleeps on couches,

33:19.665 --> 33:22.368
puts his work ahead
of relationships.

33:22.434 --> 33:23.902
You got to start somewhere.

33:23.969 --> 33:25.271
The kind of life
I'm talking about,

33:25.337 --> 33:27.073
it just doesn't happen by magic.

33:30.476 --> 33:34.446
Is that what this
has been all about?

33:34.513 --> 33:37.383
You're worried that I'm
going to turn into Larry?

33:37.449 --> 33:39.485
(chuckles)

33:43.289 --> 33:45.491
I worry about that,
too, sometimes.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.395
Yeah...

33:49.461 --> 33:52.598
because I look around and I
don't see the best role models.

33:54.700 --> 33:56.435
For example, Einstein.

33:57.336 --> 33:58.637
Einstein never had a home life.

33:58.704 --> 34:01.507
Einstein dumped his wife
and married his cousin.

34:01.573 --> 34:04.910
I hope that's not your way
of making me feel better.

34:04.976 --> 34:10.216
Dad, I'm wrestling
with all this, all of it.

34:10.282 --> 34:12.784
My math, my work with Don,

34:13.852 --> 34:14.953
Amita.

34:15.020 --> 34:17.556
I'm sorry, I just don't have it
all figured out yet.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.495
You have no right.

34:23.562 --> 34:24.896
MEGAN:
Actually, we have a warrant.

34:24.963 --> 34:26.165
This is ludicrous.

34:26.232 --> 34:28.066
You're telling me
that my painting is a forgery

34:28.134 --> 34:30.336
based on an analysis
of a photograph?

34:30.402 --> 34:32.771
A photograph that you
submitted to the museum,

34:32.838 --> 34:34.406
and I spoke to your
insurance company--

34:34.473 --> 34:35.607
they're going to
withhold your payment.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.643
Yeah, well,
I'll take them to court.

34:37.709 --> 34:38.844
I wouldn't count
on the courts

34:38.910 --> 34:41.347
backing your play a second time,
Mr. Shoemaker.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.681
The Hellmans are behind this,
aren't they?

34:42.748 --> 34:45.050
They paid some sleazy math
expert to look at a photograph

34:45.117 --> 34:46.518
and say that my Pissarro
is a fake.

34:46.585 --> 34:47.686
Well, if they think
they're going

34:47.753 --> 34:50.088
to get something out
of this, they're wrong.

34:50.156 --> 34:51.323
That's a really
interesting theory,

34:51.390 --> 34:53.392
but the math expert
works for us.

34:53.459 --> 34:54.360
Why?

34:54.426 --> 34:55.527
Why would
I steal my own painting?

34:55.594 --> 34:57.196
And if it was a fake,
why would the Hellmans

34:57.263 --> 34:59.498
have fought for four years
to get it back?

34:59.565 --> 35:01.400
-Nothing so far.
-Of course, there's nothing!

35:01.467 --> 35:02.501
I didn't steal the painting,

35:02.568 --> 35:04.736
and I never shot a gun off
in my life.

35:06.938 --> 35:11.177
My father was an honorable man
who served his country.

35:11.243 --> 35:14.213
He was not a criminal
and neither am I.

35:16.548 --> 35:19.518
So, where would someone like
Shoemaker hide that original?

35:19.585 --> 35:22.254
If he is our guy, he's done
a real good job of eliminating

35:22.321 --> 35:24.323
the one witness who could pin
the forgery on him.

35:24.390 --> 35:25.324
By killing Wheeler.

35:25.391 --> 35:27.359
Wait a minute, if he
commissioned a fake,

35:27.426 --> 35:28.860
there's got to be a forger.

35:28.927 --> 35:30.862
Maybe our second witness.

35:30.929 --> 35:32.931
Find him, we find the killer.

35:32.998 --> 35:35.601
TOLLNER: It won't be easy
catching this guy.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.336
I've met any number of forgers

35:37.403 --> 35:39.137
capable of work this good.

35:39.205 --> 35:40.406
Maybe he's been caught before.

35:40.472 --> 35:43.074
Maybe he even has a file.

35:43.141 --> 35:44.743
That's a lot of names
to run down.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.712
Well, what if we don't
run down the names?

35:46.778 --> 35:48.514
What if we run down
the paintings?

35:48.580 --> 35:50.816
We have a photograph of
the forged Pissarro, right?

35:50.882 --> 35:53.619
Yeah, and the Bureau has
a photographic database

35:53.685 --> 35:55.153
of other forgeries seized
over the years.

35:55.221 --> 35:58.224
So, we give the photograph to
Charlie, he can do an analysis

35:58.290 --> 35:59.425
against all the other forgeries.

35:59.491 --> 36:01.159
If he can tell us Pissarro
didn't paint the fake,

36:01.227 --> 36:02.328
maybe he can tell us who did.

36:02.394 --> 36:03.762
So per your request,

36:03.829 --> 36:05.597
I compared my analysis

36:05.664 --> 36:07.899
of the forged Pissarro
to the FBI database

36:07.966 --> 36:09.335
of other recovered forgeries.

36:09.401 --> 36:12.571
The algorithm identified
one painting in the database

36:12.638 --> 36:14.940
that most closely resembles
the handiwork

36:15.006 --> 36:17.175
of our suspect
to an accuracy rate

36:17.243 --> 36:18.610
of, like, 89.9%.

36:18.677 --> 36:20.145
All right, so you found him?

36:20.212 --> 36:21.313
Oh, I definitely found him.

36:21.380 --> 36:22.448
So who's our forger?

36:22.514 --> 36:25.183
His name is Gustav Stolberg.

36:25.251 --> 36:26.485
Well, where is he?

36:26.552 --> 36:28.720
He's in a Jewish cemetery

36:28.787 --> 36:30.622
in Budapest.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.258
He died in 1948.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.465
So, our forger died
60 years ago?

36:39.531 --> 36:41.367
Yeah, so the fake's at
least that old, then.

36:41.433 --> 36:44.236
Interpol just faxed over
the file on Gustav Stolberg.

36:44.303 --> 36:46.037
In 1946,
he was convicted of fraud.

36:46.104 --> 36:48.307
He died in prison
two years later.

36:48.374 --> 36:49.741
Hungarian police seized

36:49.808 --> 36:52.911
what they believed to be five
forged paintings in his shop.

36:52.978 --> 36:54.112
Take a look at the list.

36:54.179 --> 36:55.347
Fourth title down.

36:55.414 --> 36:56.615
TOLLNER:
The Pissarro.

36:56.682 --> 36:58.817
Hungarian police assumed
all five canvases were a fake.

36:58.884 --> 37:01.186
-Right, but one wasn't. -So, we
think that the real Pissarro's

37:01.253 --> 37:05.156
been sitting in a Hungarian
police vault for 60 years?

37:05.223 --> 37:06.258
Wouldn't surprise me.

37:06.325 --> 37:07.626
The Communists never
threw anything away.

37:07.693 --> 37:09.194
They packed the Pissarro
into a crate

37:09.261 --> 37:10.629
along with the other forgeries.

37:10.696 --> 37:12.831
So Mrs. Hellman's father
must have paid Stolberg

37:12.898 --> 37:13.865
to paint the forgery

37:13.932 --> 37:16.034
and then gave him the original
for safekeeping.

37:16.101 --> 37:18.637
At least there's some justice;
the Nazis looted a fake.

37:18.704 --> 37:20.772
It also means that Shoemaker's
probably telling the truth.

37:20.839 --> 37:22.974
that he didn't know the
Pissarro was a forgery.

37:23.041 --> 37:24.376
And maybe no one did.

37:24.443 --> 37:26.211
Look, the fact that that
painting was stolen a month

37:26.278 --> 37:29.014
before it was supposed to go
on tour can't be a coincidence.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.215
Wait a minute.

37:30.282 --> 37:31.317
Holden, the museum conservator.

37:31.383 --> 37:34.586
Yeah.

37:35.487 --> 37:36.622
If what you're saying is true,

37:36.688 --> 37:39.291
that the real Pissarro
has been found,

37:39.358 --> 37:40.926
then I must have made a mistake.

37:40.992 --> 37:42.328
A mistake?

37:42.394 --> 37:43.929
But you've been doing
this for 20 years.

37:43.995 --> 37:45.797
The fact is, you lied to us,
didn't you?

37:45.864 --> 37:48.734
You knew that Pissarro
was a fake the whole time.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.469
Now we're not just
talking about a painting.

37:50.536 --> 37:51.903
A man is dead.

37:51.970 --> 37:54.840
And you're looking at
conspiracy to commit murder.

37:54.906 --> 37:57.876
Whatever you were paid,
Mr. Holden, it's not enough.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.678
Paid?

37:59.745 --> 38:02.881
You think my integrity
would be for sale?

38:05.484 --> 38:06.818
He said it would ruin us.

38:06.885 --> 38:08.920
We'd already announced
the acquisition.

38:08.987 --> 38:10.689
It's one thing
to display a painting

38:10.756 --> 38:13.892
that's suspected
of being Nazi looted art...

38:15.627 --> 38:17.729
...but to exhibit
a forgery?

38:17.796 --> 38:19.431
Who said it would ruin you?

38:19.498 --> 38:21.433
(laughter and chatter)

38:21.500 --> 38:24.470
(classical music playing)

38:39.217 --> 38:41.453
Excuse me. Excuse me.

38:45.491 --> 38:47.426
Holden gave you up, Ruiz.

38:47.493 --> 38:49.495
I spent my life devoted

38:49.561 --> 38:51.963
to the reputation
of this museum.

38:52.030 --> 38:54.566
Killing a man's not going to do
much for the reputation.

38:54.633 --> 38:56.502
-Wheeler was a charlatan.
-He found out the painting

38:56.568 --> 38:58.637
was a forgery,
he tried to blackmail you.

38:58.704 --> 39:01.840
Do you know how difficult it is
for a museum like ours

39:01.907 --> 39:04.009
to actually acquire a Pissarro?

39:04.075 --> 39:04.876
Yeah, but you didn't

39:04.943 --> 39:06.478
actually acquire a Pissarro,
did you?

39:06.545 --> 39:08.514
By the time Patrick alerted me
to the forgery,

39:08.580 --> 39:09.615
it was already too late...

39:09.681 --> 39:10.849
The Pissarro had put
us on the map.

39:10.916 --> 39:13.819
Only the tour next month
would have exposed you.

39:16.622 --> 39:18.557
I thought if the painting
had just...

39:18.624 --> 39:21.326
disappeared,
what would be the harm?

39:21.393 --> 39:22.928
Shoemaker had his insurance,

39:22.994 --> 39:24.896
and the museum would have
had its future.

39:24.963 --> 39:28.033
Yeah, it's not much
of a future now, is it?

39:28.099 --> 39:29.568
Is this really necessary?

39:29.635 --> 39:33.772
Yes, this is really necessary.
Come with me.

39:37.543 --> 39:41.312
The Hungarian police
just delivered it to us.

39:41.379 --> 39:42.714
Oh, my...

39:42.781 --> 39:44.550
-It's yours, Nana.
-Oh, my...

39:44.616 --> 39:45.917
Always has been.

39:45.984 --> 39:47.385
Oh, my God...

39:50.522 --> 39:52.190
You know... I think your father

39:52.257 --> 39:55.026
clearly saw the writing
on the wall

39:55.093 --> 39:56.161
with the Nazis.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.396
So he went to Stolberg
and commissioned a forgery.

39:58.464 --> 40:04.470
After all these years...

40:04.536 --> 40:07.506
to think, even I was beginning

40:07.573 --> 40:12.110
to question whether what
I remembered was true.

40:13.779 --> 40:17.683
Well, I hope this will give you
a little bit of comfort.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.084
* It goes like this,
the fourth, the fifth *

40:19.150 --> 40:22.654
* The minor fall,
the major lift *

40:22.721 --> 40:27.425
* The baffled king composing
Hallelujah... *

40:27.493 --> 40:29.828
(crickets chirping)

40:29.895 --> 40:31.763
LARRY: You know, I can't
imagine-- six years old--

40:31.830 --> 40:35.366
the world around you safe.

40:35.433 --> 40:38.570
Then one day,
everything disappears--

40:38.637 --> 40:40.038
parents, family,

40:40.105 --> 40:41.640
everything you know...

40:41.707 --> 40:43.975
One painting can only
give you back so much.

40:44.042 --> 40:45.844
LARRY:
Well, maybe for Mrs. Hellman,

40:45.911 --> 40:49.314
given the wisdom of her years,
that'll be enough.

40:49.380 --> 40:51.717
-(door opening)
-Oh.

40:51.783 --> 40:52.818
Oh, hey.

40:52.884 --> 40:54.720
What, you guys started
without me, huh?

40:54.786 --> 40:57.155
ALAN:
I'd think Einstein would say

40:57.222 --> 40:58.223
we started with you.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.425
Just a different time
and space, am I right?

41:00.492 --> 41:01.760
I like that.

41:01.827 --> 41:04.530
I've been taking a closer look
at Einstein lately.

41:06.131 --> 41:07.465
What's to eat?

41:07.533 --> 41:09.400
Red meat on the barbecue.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.570
Provided we still
have a barbecue.

41:11.637 --> 41:13.905
Did you get my note?
We're out of propane.

41:13.972 --> 41:15.941
I thought you'd take care of it.

41:18.309 --> 41:19.244
I'm kidding.

41:19.310 --> 41:20.378
We got a new tank.

41:20.445 --> 41:21.613
We're good to go.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.314
All right...

41:23.381 --> 41:24.349
No, no, no, stay, stay.

41:24.415 --> 41:26.417
I got it.

41:26.484 --> 41:27.919
You're gonna grill?

41:27.986 --> 41:31.289
Yeah, you know, T-bone steak
with Mom's amazing steak sauce.

41:31.356 --> 41:32.724
A little corn on the cob.

41:32.791 --> 41:34.425
Hey, you want some help?

41:34.492 --> 41:37.228
No, no.
Think I can handle it.

41:38.830 --> 41:41.767
Charles, that is white corn.

41:44.169 --> 41:48.039
Hey, you know how you told me
about your mom's cousin

41:48.106 --> 41:49.775
-not finding anyone.
-Yeah.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.810
You think you could give me
a list of names?

41:51.877 --> 41:53.879
You're gonna find them?

41:53.945 --> 41:57.348
Yeah, I mean I'd like to try.

41:57.415 --> 41:59.084
What do you think?

41:59.150 --> 42:01.452
Okay.

42:01.519 --> 42:07.258
* And broken Hallelujah *

42:07.325 --> 42:10.896
* Hallelujah *

42:10.962 --> 42:13.732
* Hallelujah... *

42:15.166 --> 42:18.303
* Hallelujah *

42:18.369 --> 42:26.311
* Hallelujah... *

42:29.848 --> 42:32.884
* Hallelu... *
