CHRIS ROCK:
Growing up in Bed-Stuy, the one
thing my mother always said

00:05.573 --> 00:08.076
was that we better not
bring home any babies.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.278
In fact, my mother
was so paranoid,

00:10.311 --> 00:12.146
she didn't like
anything in the house

00:12.180 --> 00:13.547
that even reminded her
of a baby.

00:14.548 --> 00:15.516
Boy!

00:15.549 --> 00:17.418
Is that a baby?

00:17.451 --> 00:19.420
No, it's a football.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.522
(Madonna's "Papa Don't Preach"
playing)

00:21.555 --> 00:23.257
Is that a baby?

00:23.291 --> 00:25.059
No, it's a shoebox.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.227
Oh.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.596
Is that a baby?

00:28.629 --> 00:30.731
No. It's baby carrots.

00:30.764 --> 00:33.134
I was so scared
of bringing home babies,

00:33.167 --> 00:35.669
to this day my mother
has never seen my kids.

00:35.703 --> 00:38.672
Can anyone tell me
what I'm holding?

00:38.706 --> 00:40.108
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

00:40.141 --> 00:40.841
Chris?

00:40.874 --> 00:42.310
An egg?

00:42.343 --> 00:43.811
No, Chris.

00:43.844 --> 00:47.281
For the next week,
this is not an egg.

00:47.315 --> 00:49.650
These will be your children.

00:49.683 --> 00:52.286
Each and every one of you
will be paired

00:52.320 --> 00:54.555
with a member
of the opposite gender,

00:54.588 --> 00:58.592
and the two of you will be
the proud parents

00:58.626 --> 01:02.296
of a brand new
baby boy or girl.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.398
Make my baby sunny-side up.

01:04.432 --> 01:05.633
You'll have to care
for the child,

01:05.666 --> 01:07.301
and at the end of the week,

01:07.335 --> 01:10.471
you'll give a report
on your experience as parents.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.840
When you say
"care for the egg..."

01:12.873 --> 01:14.642
Uh-- you mean the baby.

01:14.675 --> 01:17.211
The baby. How do you mean?

01:17.245 --> 01:20.681
You have to treat your egg
like it's a real baby.

01:20.714 --> 01:23.184
They were a lot more
advanced on this subject

01:23.217 --> 01:25.386
in my old school.

01:25.419 --> 01:28.322
So the assignment
is to treat your egg

01:28.356 --> 01:29.857
like it's a real baby.

01:29.890 --> 01:32.593
Do we have
to do this?

01:32.626 --> 01:34.595
You have to name it,
feed it,

01:34.628 --> 01:37.898
watch it at all times,
and plan its future.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.367
What if we break it?

01:39.400 --> 01:41.602
This is worth 25% of your grade,

01:41.635 --> 01:46.140
so if you crack, break,
lose or eat your baby,

01:46.174 --> 01:47.675
it's an automatic F.

01:47.708 --> 01:50.244
Okay, but if our egg
misbehaves, can we beat it?

01:50.278 --> 01:52.280
What's CJH?

01:52.313 --> 01:53.581
Is that my egg's initials?

01:53.614 --> 01:57.151
No, that's my
Corleone Junior High stamp,

01:57.185 --> 01:59.720
so I'll know
you don't switch eggs.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.922
Now, look inside your
baskets and you'll see

02:01.955 --> 02:04.158
see the name of your
partner for the week.

02:04.192 --> 02:08.162
Chris, we have an uneven number
of boys and girls,

02:08.196 --> 02:10.364
so I thought I'd make you
a single father.

02:10.398 --> 02:11.832
I know it's something
you can relate to

02:11.865 --> 02:13.267
with your childhood and all.

02:13.301 --> 02:14.668
I have a father.

02:14.702 --> 02:16.437
Oh, I know, Chris.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.706
If only your mom knew his name.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.641
Just so you

02:20.674 --> 02:22.676
embrace this project
to the fullest,

02:22.710 --> 02:25.613
I brought something
special for you.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.749
If it's my baby's mama, I
hope she doesn't have feathers,

02:30.651 --> 02:33.787
A brown egg?

02:33.821 --> 02:37.691
They're all the same...
on the inside.

02:37.725 --> 02:41.362
Except my egg's gonna get
pulled over by the police more.

03:14.395 --> 03:15.896
CHRIS:
Instead of caring
about my egg,

03:15.929 --> 03:17.365
I was cooking up a scheme.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.632
I think I'm
gonna boil it.

03:18.666 --> 03:19.700
That way it won't break.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.769
You'd boil your child?

03:21.802 --> 03:23.937
Man, you're taking this
way too seriously.

03:23.971 --> 03:26.374
I think this
project is great.

03:26.407 --> 03:27.541
It's just like life.

03:27.575 --> 03:30.578
I've been taking care of my
brother and sister for years.

03:30.611 --> 03:33.281
So what I'm gonna do,
I'm gonna take this thing home.

03:33.314 --> 03:35.349
I'm gonna put it
in the refrigerator,

03:35.383 --> 03:36.384
and then when
Friday comes,

03:36.417 --> 03:38.252
all I have to do
is tell the class

03:38.286 --> 03:40.754
the same thing I've been doing
for the past 13 years.

03:40.788 --> 03:41.822
Which is, "Get a job!"

03:41.855 --> 03:42.723
Chris, your egg!

03:46.860 --> 03:48.262
Am I going to have to call

03:48.296 --> 03:49.363
Child Protective
Services on you?

03:49.397 --> 03:50.598
At least I didn't dangle

03:50.631 --> 03:51.765
my egg over a balcony

03:51.799 --> 03:52.833
like Michael Jackson.

03:52.866 --> 03:53.967
Are you
ready?
Yeah.

03:54.001 --> 03:56.003
I am so in there.

04:06.647 --> 04:07.948
What are you watching?

04:07.981 --> 04:09.283
Just a movie.

04:09.317 --> 04:10.518
Every kid has
fears growing up.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.520
Drew used to be
scared of spiders.

04:12.553 --> 04:15.022
I used to be scared of the
opening credits to Perry Mason.

04:15.055 --> 04:16.757
Tonya used to
be scared of clowns.

04:16.790 --> 04:21.295
But that all changed when
she saw this-- The Wolfman.

04:24.332 --> 04:25.599
It's just a werewolf.

04:25.633 --> 04:26.734
No! No, no, no!

04:26.767 --> 04:28.302
It might just be a werewolf,

04:28.336 --> 04:30.338
but to Drew it was
also an opportunity.

04:33.607 --> 04:34.775
This can't be right.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.777
That's what he said
when I was born.

04:36.810 --> 04:37.845
What's wrong?

04:37.878 --> 04:39.380
Have you been
using more power?

04:39.413 --> 04:42.850
This electric bill
is $25.83 more than usual.

04:42.883 --> 04:45.719
How am I supposed to know
how much power I'm using?

04:45.753 --> 04:48.789
Well, you take the amount of
time you use an appliance

04:48.822 --> 04:50.891
and divide the required
wattage to power it

04:50.924 --> 04:53.494
by the current cost
of kilowatt hours.

04:53.527 --> 04:56.997
Am I supposed to do that before
or after I file for divorce?

04:57.030 --> 04:58.666
Kilowatts.

04:58.699 --> 05:01.369
My mom thought "kilowatts"
was a riot in the '60s.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.576
Ah. There are the eggs.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.344
See? That's what's
running the bill up.

05:10.378 --> 05:11.879
You just used 11 cents'
worth of electricity.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.814
Why can't you
figure out what's

05:13.847 --> 05:15.416
in the refrigerator
before you open it?

05:15.449 --> 05:17.485
Because I can't
see through the door.

05:17.518 --> 05:18.852
Pass me a fork, please.

05:21.389 --> 05:22.423
Thank you.

05:22.456 --> 05:25.959
Oh... a brown egg.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.828
Stop!
Ah! What?

05:27.861 --> 05:28.962
That egg is my
school project.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.431
What are you talking about?

05:30.464 --> 05:32.400
The egg is my baby.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.001
I'm supposed to take
care of it for a week

05:34.034 --> 05:36.136
and then give a report on what
it's like to be a father.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.939
So what's it doing
in my refrigerator?

05:38.972 --> 05:41.542
Just chillin'.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.076
You're not funny.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.613
I'm just gonna leave it in there
until it was time

05:45.646 --> 05:46.980
to turn it in
and give the report.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.616
I already know
what I'm gonna say.

05:48.649 --> 05:49.717
It's an easy "A."

05:49.750 --> 05:51.852
An easy "A"?

05:51.885 --> 05:54.388
So you think that taking
care of a baby is easy?

05:54.422 --> 05:56.156
No, but it's not a baby.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.625
It's an egg.

05:57.658 --> 06:00.093
But your assignment is to take
care of this egg

06:00.127 --> 06:01.929
as if it were a baby.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.731
Do you think I left you
in the refrigerator

06:03.764 --> 06:05.065
whenever I had
something else to do?

06:05.098 --> 06:07.000
Is it bad?

06:07.901 --> 06:09.503
Not if you got
a thousand dollars.

06:09.537 --> 06:11.939
Ain't that right, baby?

06:16.910 --> 06:18.879
Break time, baby.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.080
Break time.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.015
You are gonna do
this assignment,

06:22.049 --> 06:23.784
and you're gonna
do it right.

06:23.817 --> 06:24.818
Damn!

06:26.920 --> 06:28.922
I have an announcement
to make.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.924
We have a new addition
to the family.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.993
What?
You having a baby?

06:33.026 --> 06:34.495
He ain't sleeping in my room.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.029
I'm not
having a baby.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.665
Chris did.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.733
I thought you said
if we bring home a baby,

06:39.767 --> 06:40.968
you'd slap
the Similac out of us.

06:41.001 --> 06:43.837
It's not a real baby;
it's an egg.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.973
It's Chris's new school project.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.842
Oh, cool.
So what's the baby's name?

06:48.876 --> 06:50.010
I didn't really name it.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.679
Can we call him
Junebug?

06:51.712 --> 06:52.980
Junebug?

06:53.013 --> 06:54.014
What kind of name is Junebug?

06:54.047 --> 06:55.983
It's better than what
I was thinking of--

06:56.016 --> 06:58.118
The Incredible Edible Baby.

06:58.151 --> 07:01.522
I'm going to show you
just how hard it is
to raise a baby,

07:01.555 --> 07:03.757
and if any of
y'all catch Chris

07:03.791 --> 07:05.459
mistreating this child,
you better let me know,

07:05.493 --> 07:07.961
'cause if you do, you're gonna
get a lot worse than an F.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.597
Now let's eat.

07:09.630 --> 07:10.998
Where you going?

07:11.031 --> 07:12.633
I'm gonna go get
ready to eat.

07:12.666 --> 07:13.701
Uh-uh,
no you're not.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.002
Don't you hear
that baby crying?

07:15.035 --> 07:17.571
You feed him first,
and then you eat.

07:17.605 --> 07:18.872
Now get that screaming
child out of here.

07:18.906 --> 07:22.843
If this happened now, I'd try
to get Madonna to adopt my egg.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.248
Since the baby I brought home
was just an egg,

07:28.281 --> 07:32.019
my mother decided to make sure
I got the full baby experience

07:32.052 --> 07:33.687
so I didn't
bring home a real one.

07:33.721 --> 07:34.922
Chris, wake up.
The baby's crying.

07:34.955 --> 07:35.956
What's wrong?

07:35.989 --> 07:38.191
You got to change
his diaper.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.830
Chris, wake up.
The baby's crying.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.865
What's wrong?
He's hungry.

07:48.536 --> 07:49.803
Chris?
Huh?

07:49.837 --> 07:50.938
The baby's crying.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.105
Is it hungry?
No.

07:52.139 --> 07:52.806
Is it wet?

07:52.840 --> 07:54.708
No.
What's wrong with it?

07:54.742 --> 07:56.510
He's got gas.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.091
While I was trying
to raise my baby,

08:11.124 --> 08:12.993
my father was trying
to lower the electric bill.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.027
I was watching that.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.864
I've seen it;
Rosebud's his sled.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.999
(Michael Jackson's
"Billy Jean" playing)

08:19.032 --> 08:21.068
I was listening to that.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.636
I've heard it;
the baby's not his.

08:22.670 --> 08:23.837
Got that right.

08:30.110 --> 08:30.944
That's too low.

08:30.978 --> 08:33.046
That's gonna take
all night to cook.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.214
You can eat in the morning.

08:34.247 --> 08:35.816
Combine breakfast and dinner.

08:35.849 --> 08:36.950
Call it... brinner.

08:36.984 --> 08:40.220
You have officially
lost your mind.

08:46.159 --> 08:46.960
What's that?

08:46.994 --> 08:48.962
A picture-- now you
can figure out

08:48.996 --> 08:51.264
what you want and where it is
before you open the fridge.

08:51.298 --> 08:54.201
Well, what about
if I take something out?

08:54.234 --> 08:58.806
Then you just cross the item
off the picture.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.145
I put Junebug in a paper bag,

09:05.178 --> 09:07.615
because the only way I was
going to be seen with an egg

09:07.648 --> 09:09.349
was if it was with
a side of bacon.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.918
Hey!

09:10.951 --> 09:12.252
Little dude
from across the street.

09:12.285 --> 09:13.654
Let me hold your bag.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.355
No, man, you don't want this.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.591
It's just an egg.

09:17.625 --> 09:18.959
It's for a class project.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.594
I'm supposed to act like
it's my baby.

09:20.628 --> 09:23.030
Oh, yeah? That's very inventive.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.766
I'm only good at acting
like it's not my baby.

09:25.799 --> 09:28.001
That year he won the Oscar
for Best Non-Supporting Father.

09:28.035 --> 09:31.872
Listen, if you ever have any
problems with child support,

09:31.905 --> 09:33.073
come talk to me.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.274
I can help you
save some money.

09:34.307 --> 09:37.144
It seemed like everyone
had advice for raising a baby.

09:37.177 --> 09:40.914
You need to teach this boy
how to protect himself.

09:40.948 --> 09:44.184
Now, I suggest the Brazilian
two-finger neck snap!

09:44.217 --> 09:46.153
Want me to show you
how it works?

09:46.186 --> 09:49.156
Teach the baby to honor
the mother and the father,

09:49.189 --> 09:52.259
and if the father
should meet a tragic death,

09:52.292 --> 09:54.127
the baby shouldn't be upset

09:54.161 --> 09:56.096
if the mother makes friends
with a nice man.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.898
WOMAN:
Omar, I need more bubbles!

09:57.931 --> 09:58.899
Got to go.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.100
Teach this baby the difference

10:00.133 --> 10:02.770
between the knockoffs
and the real thing.

10:02.803 --> 10:06.774
For instance, "Gucci"
does not have an "H" in it.

10:06.807 --> 10:09.643
While I was trying to keep
Junebug on the right track,

10:09.677 --> 10:11.812
Greg had become
a runaway train.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.914
Dang, Junebug is
driving me crazy.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.816
I just can't wait
till this thing is over.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.250
You think you've got problems.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.319
Me and Jennifer don't
agree on a thing.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.121
She thinks Chip
should go to Yale.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.090
I think he's a Harvard man.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.725
And I think you're
a crazy man.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.259
And you're thinking
about colleges?

10:26.293 --> 10:27.928
I'm just trying
to figure out

10:27.961 --> 10:29.262
how to get
a full night's sleep.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.098
You built a crib?

10:31.131 --> 10:32.733
Yeah, and I called
you last night.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.668
Yeah, like 50 times.

10:34.702 --> 10:36.904
Greg, you're taking this
way too seriously.

10:36.937 --> 10:40.173
It's just 'cause I didn't
want him to go to Yale.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.508
And I don't care

10:41.541 --> 10:44.712
how many cribs you build,
he's not going to Harvard.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.182
What?
Nothing.

10:54.922 --> 10:56.857
Chris.

11:18.812 --> 11:21.715
While my mother decided
to give me a break,

11:21.749 --> 11:24.284
my father was making
a break in his case.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.258
Hey, hey, hey,
what's the matter?

11:31.291 --> 11:32.425
You turned the lights off.

11:32.459 --> 11:35.095
Why are you sleeping
with the light on?

11:35.128 --> 11:36.797
'Cause I'm scared of werewolves.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.232
Werewolves

11:39.266 --> 11:41.201
Drew told me
when the full moon comes out,

11:41.234 --> 11:42.402
he's going to turn
into a werewolf.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.204
When did he tell you this?

11:44.237 --> 11:45.338
Last month.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.279
Doc was out of town,

11:52.312 --> 11:54.782
so he left his nephew Monk
to watch the store.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.383
I'm closing at 1900
hours, so keep sweeping

11:56.416 --> 11:57.985
and finish stocking
the shelves.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.987
1900 hours?

12:00.020 --> 12:02.255
7:00, boy-- don't your
parents teach you anything?

12:02.289 --> 12:04.257
Monk had been part
of a famous failed

12:04.291 --> 12:06.493
military operation
in the early '80s

12:06.526 --> 12:08.395
and was very suspicious
of authority.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.696
Watch the closing doors.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.165
Now, why should I
believe these doors
are going to close?

12:12.199 --> 12:13.466
Because you said so?

12:13.500 --> 12:14.935
Well, what if they don't?

12:14.968 --> 12:16.069
Then what?

12:16.103 --> 12:18.171
Are you gonna issue
me a public apology?

12:18.205 --> 12:20.307
Do I get to hire me a
new elevator operator?

12:20.340 --> 12:22.509
And what about all the other
men and women that died

12:22.542 --> 12:24.344
because of these
supposedly

12:26.113 --> 12:27.547
What you got in this bag, boy?

12:27.580 --> 12:29.149
What kind of rations you got?

12:29.182 --> 12:30.517
Careful!

12:30.550 --> 12:31.985
It's not lunch.

12:32.019 --> 12:33.153
It's an egg.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.221
Hey, man, what's that,

12:34.254 --> 12:35.522
a booby trap or
something, man?!

12:35.555 --> 12:37.224
You trying to kill me?
They must have sent
you to kill me,

12:37.257 --> 12:38.291
didn't they?

12:38.325 --> 12:41.895
You been ordered by my
commanding officers, huh?

12:41.929 --> 12:43.396
No, it's my class project.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.533
I'm supposed to take care of it
like it's a baby for a week.

12:46.566 --> 12:49.069
And if anything happens to it,
I get an "F."

12:49.102 --> 12:51.338
What you mean,
"If anything happens"?

12:51.371 --> 12:52.472
I'll tell you what happens.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.307
Try landing a
helicopter at night

12:54.341 --> 12:56.443
in the middle
of a sandstorm in
the Iranian desert.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.610
"If anything happens."

12:57.644 --> 12:59.446
What if they don't tell you
there's a sandstorm, huh?

12:59.479 --> 13:00.313
"If anything happens."

13:00.347 --> 13:02.415
What about if your
commanding officer

13:02.449 --> 13:04.184
doesn't tell you.
that you're going
to be taking fire

13:04.217 --> 13:05.385
from the left
or to the right

13:05.418 --> 13:07.154
or there's even going
to be a sandstorm?

13:07.187 --> 13:08.588
"If anything happens."

13:08.621 --> 13:10.090
It's because you're
commanding officer sent you

13:10.123 --> 13:12.325
on a mission that he
knew was going to fail!

13:12.359 --> 13:15.829
"If anything happens."

13:15.863 --> 13:17.030
Boy, if all you got to do
is take that egg

13:17.064 --> 13:19.332
and carry that egg around
for one week and keep it alive?

13:19.366 --> 13:21.501
Boy, you don't know
how good you got it.

13:21.534 --> 13:24.371
"If anything happens."

13:26.173 --> 13:28.141
:
"If anything happens."

13:28.175 --> 13:30.310
What you talking about, Monk?

13:30.343 --> 13:32.012
Sure do hope you're right.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.513
(Jefferson Airplane's
"White Rabbit" playing)

13:33.546 --> 13:37.117
* Feed your head.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.054
While my mother made sure
I didn't take my mind

13:41.088 --> 13:42.622
or my eye off of Junebug,

13:42.655 --> 13:45.458
She didn't count on one thing:
a ladybug.

13:45.492 --> 13:48.495
Hey, Chris, can you help me
carry some of my bags home?

13:48.528 --> 13:50.463
Uh, Monk, can I help her
carry some of her bags home?

13:50.497 --> 13:51.899
Go ahead.

13:51.932 --> 13:54.201
Thanks.

13:59.006 --> 14:00.173
Boy, where have you been?

14:00.207 --> 14:01.174
You've been gone
for almost an hour.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.409
I thought you went AWOL.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.644
How far does that girl live?
Just up the block.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.180
Oh, all right.

14:07.214 --> 14:08.515
Well, here,
got another package for you.

14:08.548 --> 14:09.582
Take this to Miss Perkins.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.621
Hey, where's Junebug?

14:14.654 --> 14:16.023
What'd you say?

14:16.056 --> 14:17.257
Boy, Junebug?!

14:17.290 --> 14:18.391
How did you know about Junebug?!

14:18.425 --> 14:19.592
That's supposed to be
a black op.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.161
Black op?

14:21.194 --> 14:22.629
Junebug is the name
of my egg.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.097
Oh.

14:24.131 --> 14:27.234
It was sitting right here.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.902
I don't know;
I've been packing bags all day.

14:28.936 --> 14:29.669
That thing could be anywhere.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.072
Oh, man!

14:32.105 --> 14:33.373
Junebug was the first egg

14:33.406 --> 14:35.242
to ever end up
on a milk carton.

14:46.419 --> 14:49.222
Until I could find my egg,
I had to make sure my mother

14:49.256 --> 14:51.658
didn't find out
and crack my skull.

14:51.691 --> 14:54.427
(jazzy spy movie-type
music playing)

15:41.241 --> 15:43.610
If I actually worked that hard
in class,

15:43.643 --> 15:46.246
I might have gone to college.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.389
I might have had a new egg,

15:56.423 --> 15:59.726
but my mother
was her same old suspicious.

16:10.237 --> 16:12.772
Chris, you haven't let that
egg out of your sight, have you?

16:12.805 --> 16:15.275
No, ma'am.
I take it everywhere I go.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.477
Found out why
that electric bill

16:17.510 --> 16:19.646
was $25-a-day,
three cents more than usual.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.614
Really?
Tonya's been sleeping

16:21.648 --> 16:23.150
with the light
on at night.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.018
Girl, you know you're not scared
of the dark.

16:25.052 --> 16:27.454
No, but I'm scared
of werewolves.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.721
ROCHELLE:
What wolves?

16:28.755 --> 16:31.024
JULIUS:
Werewolves.

16:31.058 --> 16:32.225
Drew told me he was going
to turn into one.

16:32.259 --> 16:34.561
She's been sleeping with the
light on for the last month.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.663
CHRIS:
There's no such thing
as werewolves, stupid.

16:36.696 --> 16:37.930
Yes, there are.

16:37.964 --> 16:42.435
In ancient folklore, a werewolf
is a man who turns into a wolf

16:42.469 --> 16:44.471
because he's been bitten
by another werewolf.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.306
It happens
over a full moon.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.375
ROCHELLE:
Boy, did you tell her that?

16:48.408 --> 16:49.642
What?

16:49.676 --> 16:51.078
I said, did you tell her that?

16:52.079 --> 16:53.246
I was just playing.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.382
Oh, there's about
to be a full moon.

16:55.415 --> 16:56.583
Get your behind
upstairs.

16:56.616 --> 16:57.717
Chris, cover your egg's ears.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.220
Dang, Tonya.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.621
Now!

17:01.654 --> 17:03.356
How many times
do I have to tell you?

17:03.390 --> 17:05.425
Stop telling your sister
all that foolishness!

17:05.458 --> 17:07.794
Pass the biscuits.
And go get my belt.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.529
Good thing it was Drew
getting a beating

17:09.562 --> 17:10.697
and not my egg.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.765
You're overbearing
and clingy.

17:12.799 --> 17:15.635
If you keep it up, you're going
to be a single father, too.

17:15.668 --> 17:19.439
20 years later, that's what
Greg's mail-order bride said.

17:19.472 --> 17:20.740
This project sucks.

17:20.773 --> 17:22.075
I know.

17:22.109 --> 17:24.511
Listen, I got to
tell you something.

17:24.544 --> 17:28.181
Last time I heard that,
my mom ran off with my uncle.

17:28.215 --> 17:30.650
Greg, I lost my egg.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.719
What? That's an automatic "F."

17:32.752 --> 17:34.587
I know, I know,
but I replaced it.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.689
Just let me know
if it looks like
the real thing.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.730
Wow, you did this?

17:43.763 --> 17:45.365
Yeah. What do you think?

17:45.398 --> 17:47.334
I think you're going to fail.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.202
Your stamp's upside down.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.574
Before Buffy slayed vampires,

17:54.607 --> 17:57.810
Tonya tried
to whack a werewolf.

17:57.844 --> 18:01.148
* When you close your eyes
and you go to sleep... *

18:01.181 --> 18:02.815
Tonya, what
are you doing?!

18:02.849 --> 18:04.584
If you're a werewolf,
the only way to kill you

18:04.617 --> 18:05.885
is with a silver stake
through your heart.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.487
No, no, Tonya,
I'm not a werewolf.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.755
Werewolves are just
make-believe.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.323
It's a full moon, Drew,
don't play with me.

18:10.357 --> 18:11.558
Are you a werewolf?

18:11.591 --> 18:12.659
No, Tonya, I promise.
I'm not a werewolf.

18:12.692 --> 18:13.593
Please don't kill me.

18:13.626 --> 18:14.394
Is that a hair
growing through your arm?

18:14.427 --> 18:16.829
No, no, no, it's not.
No, I swear.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.498
Are you lying?
I'm not a werewolf,

18:18.531 --> 18:20.533
Tonya, please.
You better not be.

18:20.567 --> 18:23.403
Drew wouldn't be this scared
again until Tonya's birthday

18:23.436 --> 18:25.572
when she asked
for silver bullets.

18:31.478 --> 18:32.845
This just doesn't
make sense.

18:32.879 --> 18:35.282
On my count, we're
missing an egg.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.884
I don't know, baby,
maybe we ate it.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.587
ROCHELLE:
Hey, sweetie.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.622
You ready for your
big report?

18:42.655 --> 18:45.124
No, I was ready
to have egg on my face.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.894
I lost my egg.

18:47.927 --> 18:50.263
Oh. That's not your egg?

18:50.297 --> 18:52.265
No, this is the one I took
from the refrigerator

18:52.299 --> 18:53.866
when I lost
the other one.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.335
Wait a minute.

18:55.368 --> 18:56.836
You got me here like Columbo
trying to figure

18:56.869 --> 18:58.305
how my food is disappearing,

18:58.338 --> 18:59.706
and it's right there
in your hand?

18:59.739 --> 19:01.408
I was scared to tell you
what happened.

19:01.441 --> 19:02.875
I didn't want you to get mad.

19:02.909 --> 19:05.178
See, Chris?
That's my point.

19:05.212 --> 19:07.847
If your real child was missing,
would you hide it from me?

19:07.880 --> 19:08.915
Yes.
No.

19:08.948 --> 19:11.284
Would you steal a white kid
and paint him brown?

19:11.318 --> 19:12.219
Yes.
No, sir.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.853
See, you thinking
about the wrong thing.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.788
The hardest thing
about being a father

19:15.822 --> 19:17.624
is not learning how
to care for somebody;

19:17.657 --> 19:19.692
it's learning how to quit
thinking so much about yourself.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.194
You know, I can't

19:21.228 --> 19:23.196
let you go
to class with a fake egg.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.531
But I'm going to get an "F."

19:24.564 --> 19:26.466
No, you're not.

19:30.237 --> 19:31.838
Junebug

19:31.871 --> 19:32.872
Monk brought it over.

19:32.905 --> 19:35.342
Apparently, when you weren't
paying attention,

19:35.375 --> 19:37.610
it got mixed in with another
customer's groceries.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.446
Well, why didn't you tell me
you had it?

19:39.479 --> 19:40.880
Why didn't you tell me
you lost it?

19:41.948 --> 19:42.915
Here.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.853
And the next time you bring
a baby in my house,

19:46.886 --> 19:50.957
you better bring his mother,
and she better be your wife.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.629
What I thought
would be an easy "A"

19:56.663 --> 19:58.631
ended up being one
of the hardest grades

19:58.665 --> 19:59.866
I've ever earned.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.334
You know, I
made fun of you

20:01.368 --> 20:02.469
for taking this
project so seriously,

20:02.502 --> 20:03.603
but I actually
learned something.

20:03.636 --> 20:07.240
Me, too: women are nuts
and private school's expensive.

20:07.274 --> 20:09.909
Yeah, I don't want to be father
any time soon.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.378
MORELLO:
All right, class,
take your seats

20:11.411 --> 20:12.512
so we can get started.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.647
I can't wait to hear
all your reports.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.850
Junebug!

20:18.985 --> 20:21.654
Chris, why don't you start?

20:21.688 --> 20:24.391
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.993
