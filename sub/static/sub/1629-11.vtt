00:02.378 --> 00:04.585
FELIX: You never
cease to amaze me, Peter.

00:05.173 --> 00:07.664
Outwitting the Evil Queen
in less than a day...

00:07.758 --> 00:09.623
(INHALES SHARPLY)
It's impressive.

00:10.386 --> 00:13.423
She loves the boy.
That makes her weak.

00:14.265 --> 00:18.224
This is it. This is where we'll cast it.
The ingredients?

00:21.564 --> 00:24.681
When it's done, will they all be dead?

00:24.775 --> 00:25.764
Worse.

00:25.860 --> 00:29.193
They'll be slaves
to this new land we're making,

00:29.280 --> 00:30.895
with no idea who they once were.

00:31.574 --> 00:32.984
Death is final, Felix.

00:33.659 --> 00:37.322
Their suffering will be eternal.

00:39.832 --> 00:40.867
(SPLASHES)

00:40.958 --> 00:41.947
MARY: Another curse?

00:42.793 --> 00:43.953
lt's happening again?

00:44.045 --> 00:46.912
Gold, this curse,
is it going to work like the last one?

00:47.006 --> 00:49.964
The last one was created
to service the Queen's wishes.

00:50.301 --> 00:52.792
This will be done per Pan's desire.

00:52.970 --> 00:55.052
I would count on something hellish.

00:55.139 --> 00:56.845
The curse was built to be unstoppable.

00:57.141 --> 00:58.426
There's nothing that can be done.

00:59.185 --> 01:00.641
Well, it is possible to stop it.

01:00.728 --> 01:01.717
What?

01:02.230 --> 01:03.686
By using the scroll itself.

01:04.357 --> 01:07.690
It can only be undone
by the person who used the scroll.

01:07.777 --> 01:08.812
That's you, Regina.

01:09.570 --> 01:13.609
What she did is child's play
compared to what I have in mind.

01:13.699 --> 01:14.688
(WHOOSHES)

01:15.534 --> 01:16.569
-(WATER BUBBLING)
-I knew you'd win.

01:18.871 --> 01:20.156
Peter Pan never fails.

01:23.751 --> 01:24.831
(WHOOSHES)

01:24.919 --> 01:26.455
REGINA: What do / have to do?

01:26.545 --> 01:28.081
You must destroy the scroll.

01:28.172 --> 01:29.537
And both your curse
and his shall be ended.

01:29.632 --> 01:32.544
But know this, there will be a price.

01:32.635 --> 01:33.670
A steep one.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.126
What do you suggest?

01:35.221 --> 01:39.055
Instead of going to him,
bring him to us with a spell.

01:39.267 --> 01:42.259
One that will return
Pan and Henry to their own bodies.

01:42.353 --> 01:43.513
(WATER CONTINUES BUBBLING)

01:43.604 --> 01:45.265
Are we missing something?

01:45.856 --> 01:46.845
Yes.

01:46.941 --> 01:48.181
What is it?

01:48.401 --> 01:50.687
The heart of the thing I love most.

01:50.987 --> 01:53.478
You mean your son's heart?
Rumplestiltskin?

01:53.656 --> 01:55.863
No. No, I never loved Rumple.

01:56.075 --> 01:58.782
Well, then whose heart do we need?
Who do you love?

01:58.911 --> 02:00.776
Love can mean many things, Felix.

02:01.205 --> 02:03.446
It doesn't just come from romance.

02:03.833 --> 02:05.073
Or family.

02:06.210 --> 02:07.711
It can also come from loyalty.

02:08.170 --> 02:09.205
Friendship.

02:09.463 --> 02:12.375
Only one person
has always believed in Pan.

02:14.260 --> 02:15.340
That's me.

02:17.763 --> 02:20.300
Don't be afraid. Be flattered.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.180
No,no,no!

02:22.852 --> 02:24.092
-(SQU|SHES)
-Argh!

-(HEARTBEAT THUMPING)

02:25.730 --> 02:26.936
(GURGUNG)

02:31.193 --> 02:34.105
If I'm back in my own body,
that means I'll have the scroll.

02:34.196 --> 02:35.732
I can bring it to you guys.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.233
Exactly right, Henry.

02:37.325 --> 02:40.112
Even you aren't powerful enough
to cast such a spell.

02:40.202 --> 02:42.693
Well, given the proper tool, I could be.

02:42.788 --> 02:44.119
TINKER BELL: The Black Fairy's wand.

02:44.206 --> 02:45.992
One of the most powerful fairies
that ever existed.

02:46.751 --> 02:48.867
Well-versed in dark magic.

02:48.961 --> 02:53.000
The Blue Fairy exiled her,
but before she did, she took her wand.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.671
I assume our dearly
departed Mother Superior

02:54.759 --> 02:56.044
had it hidden at her residence.

02:56.135 --> 02:57.716
Then what are we waiting for?
Let's hit the convent.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.210
Can I come?

02:59.305 --> 03:01.261
I should pay my respects
to Blue after all.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.630
GOLD: Then it's settled.

03:03.059 --> 03:04.720
The rest of us
should get back to my shop

03:04.810 --> 03:06.971
and prepare Henry for the spell.

03:13.235 --> 03:15.100
(WHOOSHING)

03:15.196 --> 03:17.027
(RUMBLING)

03:39.345 --> 03:41.006
What if it fails?

03:41.097 --> 03:42.928
A magic wardrobe? It's a long shot.

03:43.015 --> 03:44.596
We all know this.

03:44.683 --> 03:46.514
So what do we do
if this plan doesn't work?

03:46.602 --> 03:49.059
Then the Queen's curse
will transport us to a new land.

03:49.355 --> 03:50.470
We will lose our memories

03:50.564 --> 03:53.101
and become a slave
to her darkest desires.

03:53.192 --> 03:56.480
So we have to have faith that
your child will find a way to save us.

03:56.946 --> 03:58.061
If we don't know who we are

03:58.155 --> 03:59.361
and we can't tell her
that she's the Savior,

03:59.448 --> 04:01.234
how will she know what to do?

04:01.325 --> 04:04.692
One day, when the time is right,
our story will reveal itself to her.

04:04.787 --> 04:06.743
-(WH|SPERS) "Our story"?
-You have to trust me.

04:06.831 --> 04:08.321
"Our story," what does that mean?

04:08.791 --> 04:12.579
I don't know yet.
But I do know that it will happen.

04:12.670 --> 04:14.581
Then how can you be so sure?

04:15.005 --> 04:17.838
Because I have the one thing
you need now more than anything.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.007
Hope.

04:21.429 --> 04:24.637
Good luck, Snow. Have faith.

04:30.729 --> 04:32.139
(SIGHS)

04:32.523 --> 04:35.936
That's easy to say when you have
magic wings and a wand.

04:36.026 --> 04:37.857
What can we do,
but choose to believe her?

04:42.366 --> 04:44.448
This was supposed to be hers.

04:45.870 --> 04:47.360
We had such plans.

04:47.455 --> 04:50.288
Listen to Blue.
Have hope. We can prevail.

04:52.042 --> 04:55.455
This curse has destroyed
every dream this family ever had.

04:55.546 --> 04:57.082
We don't know
what the future holds for us.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.875
How do you know
that it holds anything good?

04:59.300 --> 05:01.131
Because the unknown isn't always bad.

05:02.720 --> 05:06.554
Life is full of twists and turns
you never see coming.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.552
This curse? It's just a turn.

05:12.480 --> 05:17.645
But all I ever wanted
was for us to raise our child together.

05:17.735 --> 05:20.351
That was our happy ending.
And now it's gone.

05:20.446 --> 05:22.311
The future we imagined is gone,

05:22.406 --> 05:24.067
but that doesn't mean
we can't find another one.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.523
An unexpected one.

05:32.124 --> 05:33.409
I choose hope.

05:40.257 --> 05:41.372
I can believe.

05:50.434 --> 05:52.595
MARY: This mobile
hung above your crib.

05:52.686 --> 05:56.053
It was supposed to hang over your crib.

05:56.982 --> 05:59.143
I like the unicorns.

06:02.112 --> 06:03.318
Giving you up when the curse hit

06:03.447 --> 06:05.108
was the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

06:05.241 --> 06:06.401
I know.

06:06.492 --> 06:07.527
Every time I look at you,

06:07.618 --> 06:10.451
I wonder what would have happened
if I hadn't had to.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.116
I do the same thing with Henry.

06:13.207 --> 06:15.038
You were doing your best.
You were giving him...

06:15.125 --> 06:16.786
His best chance.

06:18.379 --> 06:21.041
Yeah. But still.

06:21.131 --> 06:24.464
Things would've been very different
ifl had kept him.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.884
We would have had a life together.

06:26.971 --> 06:28.461
A normal one.

06:28.556 --> 06:31.298
Back in Boston, or someplace else.

06:31.392 --> 06:32.381
Huh.

06:33.644 --> 06:35.430
But I guess all that
was just not meant to be.

06:41.026 --> 06:43.062
You doing okay, kid?

06:43.153 --> 06:46.281
Yeah, I'm just ready to be me again.

06:47.324 --> 06:50.157
Not much longer now, Henry.
Not much longer.

06:51.537 --> 06:54.745
Once we have the wand,
all will be as it should.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.167
Sorry to interrupt,
but we need your help.

07:08.387 --> 07:09.593
With What?

07:09.680 --> 07:11.591
The Black Fairy's wand is here,
we need it.

07:11.682 --> 07:12.671
We can never...

07:12.766 --> 07:14.017
Yeah, it's a terrible, terrible thing.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.466
But what's coming is worse.
Where is it?

07:15.644 --> 07:16.633
(LOUD THUMP)

07:19.148 --> 07:20.479
(SHADOW SHRIEKING)

07:22.401 --> 07:24.312
What the hell was that?

07:24.403 --> 07:25.643
It was Pan's Shadow.

07:25.738 --> 07:26.898
(THUMPING)

07:29.617 --> 07:30.652
What does it want?

07:30.743 --> 07:32.074
-The wand.
-Run!

07:32.202 --> 07:33.578
Run, run!

07:35.414 --> 07:36.494
Get the hell out of here.

07:36.582 --> 07:37.822

(GROWLS)

07:43.047 --> 07:44.036
(ROARS)

07:50.596 --> 07:52.461
Mr. Smee, you might want
to pick up the pace.

07:52.556 --> 07:54.672
It would do ourjourney
and your physique some good.

07:54.767 --> 07:55.882
Sorry, Captain.

07:58.937 --> 08:01.804
It's just this place gives me the creeps.

08:01.899 --> 08:03.309
(ANIMAL HOWLING IN DISTANCE)

08:03.400 --> 08:05.356
Don't you think
we should head back to the ship?

08:05.444 --> 08:08.607
Not until I find a way
off this accursed island.

08:09.031 --> 08:10.612
We've dawdled here for too long.

08:10.699 --> 08:13.816
Now that I know there's a dagger
that can end The Dark One,

08:13.911 --> 08:16.243
we must return to our land.

08:17.081 --> 08:18.196
My purpose is renewed.

08:19.249 --> 08:22.116
Why can't your purpose
be back at the ship where it's safe?

08:24.922 --> 08:26.082
Smee?

08:28.258 --> 08:29.543
(GRUNTS)

08:29.927 --> 08:33.044
WOMAN: Aren't you a little old
to be a Lost Boy?

08:33.138 --> 08:34.548
I'm not part of Pan's brigade.

08:34.640 --> 08:37.632
And I can assure you,
I am anything but a boy.

08:39.103 --> 08:41.810
Who are you and why are you here?

08:42.564 --> 08:44.850
I'm the captain of the Jolly Roger,
and I'm here looking...

08:44.942 --> 08:46.682
(INHALES SHARPLY)
For some magic

08:46.777 --> 08:49.985
to help me make my way
back home to my land.

08:50.656 --> 08:53.113
You don't have any, do you? Magic?

08:53.951 --> 08:55.282
(WHISPERS) Fresh out.

08:56.161 --> 08:58.368
Well, I don't buy that for a second.

08:58.455 --> 09:01.242
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you were a fairy.

09:01.333 --> 09:05.576
And if I didn't know any better,
I'd say you were a pirate.

09:05.671 --> 09:06.956
Guilty.

09:08.132 --> 09:10.623
So tell me, fairy, can you help me?

09:11.009 --> 09:12.135
Help you?

09:13.762 --> 09:17.300
Aren't you worried
about me slitting your throat?

09:21.854 --> 09:24.311
Well, that's not the fairy way.

09:25.441 --> 09:27.602
You should be helping me
find my happy ending,

09:27.693 --> 09:30.275
or something else equally as precious.

09:30.654 --> 09:32.155
I was a fairy.

09:32.990 --> 09:34.480
A long time ago.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.357
But then my wings were taken away.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.490
As for your happy ending?

09:42.207 --> 09:43.492
You're on your own.

09:47.296 --> 09:48.502
Watch it!

09:48.630 --> 09:52.168
It's not a weapon,
in the traditional sense.

09:55.554 --> 09:56.669
Rum?

10:01.560 --> 10:02.891
What's so important back home?

10:05.189 --> 10:07.680
The Dark One
murdered the woman I loved.

10:08.859 --> 10:11.475
I intend to make him suffer for it.

10:12.654 --> 10:15.191
And so killing him
is your happy ending?

10:15.574 --> 10:19.158
Even if by doing so,
you could end your own existence?

10:19.244 --> 10:21.656
I'd risk my life for two things.

10:22.414 --> 10:23.870
Love and revenge.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.161
I lost the first.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.709
And if I die for my vengeance,

10:30.547 --> 10:32.629
then that's enough satisfaction for me.

10:32.716 --> 10:33.705
(SHADOW SHRIEKS)

10:33.801 --> 10:36.543
So, all we have to do
is light the candle again, right?

10:37.137 --> 10:38.593
That's how you trapped it in Neverland?

10:38.680 --> 10:40.887
Yeah. This time,
I say we get rid of it for good.

10:41.016 --> 10:42.051
I'll draw its ire.

10:42.267 --> 10:43.598
Are you sure you want to do this?

10:43.727 --> 10:46.969
If it's the only way to prevent this
bloody curse from obliterating us all,

10:47.064 --> 10:48.429
then it's a risk I'm willing to take.

10:48.524 --> 10:50.685
I thought you'd only risk your life
for love or revenge.

10:50.776 --> 10:51.982

10:52.069 --> 10:54.230

Is that the best you've got?

11:09.878 --> 11:10.867
(GROANS)

11:12.965 --> 11:14.125
Can you trap it?

11:14.216 --> 11:15.956
No, it's too high. We got to get closer.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.920
And I can't fly up there.

11:18.387 --> 11:19.502
Tink?

11:19.596 --> 11:21.848
If you didn't notice,
I don't have my wings.

11:21.932 --> 11:22.967
But you have pixie dust.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.180
That doesn't work.

11:24.268 --> 11:28.557
No, no, no, Tink, you made it work once.
You can do it again.

12:24.036 --> 12:25.321

12:27.581 --> 12:29.321

12:37.841 --> 12:39.126
Look who's still a fairy.

12:39.509 --> 12:42.717
And look who's still a pirate.
You all right?

12:43.138 --> 12:45.595
Well, I lost a hand once.
This is nothing.

12:46.516 --> 12:49.679
For the record, I know
why you risked your life back there.

12:50.020 --> 12:52.181
And it wasn't for yourself or revenge.

12:52.481 --> 12:53.516
It was for Emma.

12:54.191 --> 12:55.306
WOMAN: Well done, Green.

12:57.069 --> 12:58.149
Blue?

12:58.695 --> 12:59.684
But you were...

12:59.821 --> 13:01.857
Gone, I know.

13:02.032 --> 13:04.819
But when you killed the Shadow,
mine was returned and I was revived.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.109
Thank you.

13:07.663 --> 13:10.200
You finally believed in yourself, Green.

13:10.415 --> 13:11.666
Tinker Bell.

13:11.750 --> 13:12.830
Welcome back.

13:13.210 --> 13:15.451
I'm a fairy again?

13:15.545 --> 13:17.331
Even after I disobeyed all your rules?

13:17.422 --> 13:18.832
(CHUCKLES)

13:18.924 --> 13:20.380
I might have been overly strict.

13:20.884 --> 13:23.216
You deserved your wings, Tinker Bell.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.377
And you have earned them back
many times over.

13:25.555 --> 13:26.715
(WHISPERS) Thank you.

13:28.225 --> 13:30.682
As for the Black Fairy's wand...

13:30.811 --> 13:31.800
(SIGHS)

13:33.772 --> 13:35.888
Go. Save us all.

13:42.072 --> 13:44.859
She's back. The Blue Fairy.
She gave us the wand.

13:45.534 --> 13:47.070
Do we need anything else?

13:47.244 --> 13:49.030
GOLD: Only one more item.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.326
What is that?

13:54.418 --> 13:56.329
This is one of the only useful things
I managed to pilfer

13:56.420 --> 13:58.536
from Greg and Tamara
before they left for Neverland.

14:00.257 --> 14:02.839
It renders anyone with magic
utterly powerless.

14:02.926 --> 14:04.882
I haven't forgotten about all that,
by the way.

14:06.430 --> 14:08.091
May I see your wrist, Henry?

14:11.852 --> 14:14.969
I want to make sure
that when my dear old dad awakes,

14:15.063 --> 14:16.678
that he's weakened.

14:17.065 --> 14:19.226
This will block his powers.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.270
So what happens now?

14:21.945 --> 14:24.527
I enact the spell,
you fall into a deep sleep,

14:24.614 --> 14:27.947
and when you awake,
you're back in your own body.

14:28.744 --> 14:31.156
And then you hang on to that scroll

14:31.246 --> 14:33.453
and you come find us
as fast as you can.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.327
When I gave my heart to Pan,

14:36.418 --> 14:37.498
(SCOFFS)
I thought I was being a hero.

14:40.088 --> 14:41.294
I'm sorry.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.042
No, you're not the one
that needs to be sorry.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.293
Pan does.

14:45.135 --> 14:46.591
It's time.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.057
Keep your eye on the wand.

15:04.946 --> 15:05.981
What's happening?

15:08.909 --> 15:10.649
Henry's spirit is leaving Pan's body.

15:18.335 --> 15:19.575
It worked.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.669
Let's go find our son.

15:32.516 --> 15:33.596
You're not coming?

15:33.809 --> 15:35.515
No, no. Ithink not.

15:36.436 --> 15:41.180
My father and I
have some unfinished family business.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.485
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

16:07.968 --> 16:09.003
Henry?

16:09.719 --> 16:12.586
You didn't turn in your homework again.
Is there a problem?

16:17.227 --> 16:20.719
Oh, Henry, things really will change
if you just believe it.

16:21.898 --> 16:23.149
Life is unpredictable.

16:23.233 --> 16:24.814
Is your life unpredictable?

16:24.901 --> 16:28.485
'Cause it seems to me like everything
is pretty much the same around here.

16:28.822 --> 16:29.857
Except me.

16:32.868 --> 16:34.654
My birth mom didn't love me.

16:35.412 --> 16:38.199
Regina says she does, but she doesn't.

16:39.583 --> 16:41.244
I don't belong here.

16:41.918 --> 16:43.954
You do belong here, Henry.

16:44.421 --> 16:46.332
You are loved.

16:52.721 --> 16:54.257
I want to show you something.

16:55.432 --> 16:57.798
This morning, I was cleaning out
my bedroom closet.

16:57.893 --> 17:00.350
Like I've done every week,
thousands of times.

17:00.437 --> 17:01.597
And do you know what happened?

17:02.022 --> 17:04.729
I found something.
Something I've never noticed before.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.904
It was just there.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.273
Like magic.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.363
That's not possible.

17:17.454 --> 17:19.319
Well, of course not, but it happened.

17:20.248 --> 17:22.705
This book somehow arrived.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.293
Was it given to me?
Did I forget about it?

17:24.419 --> 17:26.535
I don't know, but there it was.

17:26.630 --> 17:28.666
And do you know what I saw
when I looked inside?

17:30.800 --> 17:31.926
Hope.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.839
Looks like fairy tales to me.

17:38.934 --> 17:41.926
And what exactly do you think
fairy tales are?

17:43.980 --> 17:47.723
They are a reminder
that our lives will get better

17:47.817 --> 17:49.978
if we just hold onto hope.

17:51.154 --> 17:53.941
Your happy ending
may not be what you expect,

17:54.616 --> 17:57.278
but that is what will make it so special.

18:02.165 --> 18:03.450
Can I borrow this?

18:03.959 --> 18:05.244
You can have it.

18:05.335 --> 18:06.575
Really?

18:06.670 --> 18:10.379
Believing in even the possibility
of a happy ending is a powerful thing.

18:11.508 --> 18:12.839
I think you could use it.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.675
I'll see you in class.

18:21.476 --> 18:23.307
-Miss Blanchard!
-Yes?

18:29.192 --> 18:30.307

-Yeah.

19:06.229 --> 19:08.140

in my sleep, laddie.

19:47.771 --> 19:49.853
You've taken away my magic.

19:49.939 --> 19:54.057
That's why it's so easy for you
to strut around and pose now, isn't it?

19:54.986 --> 19:56.226
I wanted to talk to you.

19:57.072 --> 20:01.281
I wanted you to see me
and think about what you've done.

20:01.409 --> 20:02.489
Of course.

20:03.286 --> 20:05.493
To look at my son here at the end,

20:05.580 --> 20:09.198
and really see him
and think about what might have been?

20:09.292 --> 20:11.078
Is that what you want?

20:12.462 --> 20:13.497
Because I do.

20:15.590 --> 20:16.875
I remember looking at you.

20:16.966 --> 20:20.629
The littlest babe, helpless and all mine.

20:22.472 --> 20:24.428
And those big, big eyes,

20:25.266 --> 20:29.054
just full of tears, pulling at me.

20:29.145 --> 20:32.057
Pulling away my name,

20:32.148 --> 20:34.639
my money, my time.

20:34.984 --> 20:36.975
Pulling away any hope
of making my life

20:37.070 --> 20:39.277
into something better for myself.

20:39.614 --> 20:43.323

20:43.493 --> 20:46.735

and never stop.

20:47.997 --> 20:51.125
What are you now? A couple hundred?

20:52.794 --> 20:54.500
Can't I be free of you?

20:54.629 --> 20:56.335
Oh, you will be.

20:57.340 --> 20:58.455
In death.

21:00.635 --> 21:03.627
Then one last lesson, son.

21:04.806 --> 21:06.967

to take their memories.

special meaning to you,

27:34.403 --> 27:36.359
(WHISPERING)
Rumple, please...

27:36.989 --> 27:38.854
You can stop this.

27:38.950 --> 27:40.315
(LABORED BREATHING)

27:40.409 --> 27:41.990
Remove the dagger.

27:43.287 --> 27:45.539
We can start over.

27:48.626 --> 27:51.368
We can have a happy ending.
(CHUCKLES)

27:51.462 --> 27:53.623
Ah, but I'm a villain.

27:55.341 --> 27:59.755
And villains don't get happy endings.

28:47.560 --> 28:50.347
No! Rumple!

28:52.273 --> 28:54.138
He's gone.

28:58.988 --> 29:02.651
Regina, are you okay?

29:04.911 --> 29:06.196
I'm fine.

29:08.998 --> 29:09.987
I'm so sorry.

29:12.501 --> 29:14.913
My father did what he had to do.

29:16.297 --> 29:17.707
He saved us.

29:20.217 --> 29:21.627
Regina, don't let him die for nothing.

29:24.055 --> 29:25.170
Regina?

29:25.264 --> 29:26.253
What?

29:26.349 --> 29:28.305
We're here for a reason, love. Pan.

29:28.476 --> 29:29.511
He's dead.

29:30.102 --> 29:31.182
HOOK: His curse remains.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.135
Can you stop it?

29:33.230 --> 29:36.142
Or shall we all start preparing our souls.
'Cause mine is gonna take some time.

29:46.369 --> 29:47.700
LEROY: It's here!

29:48.454 --> 29:50.035
It's here!

29:50.539 --> 29:52.404
The curse! It's here!

29:52.750 --> 29:55.287
(PANTING) It's coming. From all sides.

29:55.753 --> 29:56.913
There's no escape.

29:57.004 --> 29:59.290
It's not too late.
We can still stop it, right?

29:59.382 --> 30:00.497
(RUMBLING IN DISTANCE)

30:00.591 --> 30:01.671
Regina?

30:01.968 --> 30:03.174
Yes.

30:03.844 --> 30:04.833
Yes.

30:06.055 --> 30:07.135
Well, what's the price?

30:07.223 --> 30:09.088
Gold said that there was a price.
What is our price?

30:11.519 --> 30:13.305
It's not our price.

30:14.438 --> 30:15.553
It's mine.

30:16.023 --> 30:17.604
What are you talking about?

30:17.858 --> 30:21.567
It's what I felt when I first held it.

30:23.990 --> 30:26.356
I have to say goodbye
to the thing I love most.

30:29.704 --> 30:30.739
Henry?

30:31.580 --> 30:33.081
I can never see him again.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.367
I have no choice.
I have to undo what I started.

30:38.587 --> 30:40.418
The curse that brought us
to Storybrooke.

30:40.506 --> 30:43.088
That created Storybrooke.

30:43.300 --> 30:45.291
It doesn't belong here.

30:45.845 --> 30:48.177
And neither do any of us.

30:48.264 --> 30:50.471
Breaking the curse destroys the town.

30:50.891 --> 30:54.383
It will wink out of existence
as though it were never here.

30:55.980 --> 30:59.313
And everyone will go back
to where they're from.

31:00.693 --> 31:02.604
Prevented from ever returning.

31:03.696 --> 31:05.982
You'll go back to the enchanted forest.

31:06.073 --> 31:07.404
All of us.

31:08.784 --> 31:10.285
Except Henry.

31:11.287 --> 31:14.950
He will stay here
because he was born here.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.531
-Alone?
-No.

31:19.045 --> 31:20.581
You will take him.

31:21.297 --> 31:23.458
Because you're the Savior.

31:24.008 --> 31:26.545
You were created to break the curse.

31:29.138 --> 31:32.505
And, once again, you can escape it.

31:34.518 --> 31:38.352
I don't want to.
We'll both go back, with everyone.

31:38.439 --> 31:39.679
That's not an option.

31:40.691 --> 31:42.431
I can't be with him.

31:42.526 --> 31:44.903
If I don't pay the price,
none of this will work.

31:46.238 --> 31:47.569
(THUNDERCLAP,

31:50.826 --> 31:52.657
Emma, you have to go.

31:53.162 --> 31:54.652
I just found you.

31:55.456 --> 31:57.697
And now it's time for you
to leave us again.

31:57.833 --> 32:00.119
For your best chance. For his.

32:00.211 --> 32:01.826
No. No.

32:02.505 --> 32:05.588
I'm not done.

32:06.217 --> 32:07.673
I'm the Savior, right?

32:07.760 --> 32:09.341
I'm supposed to bring back
all the happy endings.

32:09.428 --> 32:10.508
That's what Henry always said.

32:10.638 --> 32:13.220
Happy endings aren't always
what we think they will be.

32:14.100 --> 32:15.556
Look around you.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.179
You've touched the lives
of everyone here.

32:21.148 --> 32:22.763
But we're a family.

32:22.858 --> 32:25.520
Yes, and we always will be.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.192
You gave us that.

32:27.488 --> 32:30.525
You and Henry can be a family,
and you can get your wish.

32:31.117 --> 32:33.608
You can be like everyone else.
You can be happy.

32:35.246 --> 32:38.204
It's time for you
to believe in yourself, Emma.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.121
It's time for you to find hope.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.916
I've known you for some time.

32:43.003 --> 32:45.619
And all I wanted was for you
to get the hell out of my life

32:45.714 --> 32:47.170
so I can be with my son.

32:50.511 --> 32:53.048
(VOICE BREAKS)
But really what I want

32:54.223 --> 32:56.179
is for Henry to be happy.

32:59.145 --> 33:01.136
We have no choice.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.391
You have to go.

33:08.821 --> 33:09.981

33:29.675 --> 33:31.290

33:31.385 --> 33:32.716
It's a boy, Emma.

33:35.306 --> 33:36.421
Emma?

you can change your mind.

(TEARFULLY)
No. I can't be a mother.

34:22.478 --> 34:23.809
What do you mean?

34:23.896 --> 34:28.310
If I had never gone to get Emma,
if I just lived under the curse with you,

34:28.943 --> 34:31.275
none of this would've ever happened.

34:31.946 --> 34:35.154
I thought I was alone.
I thought you didn't love me.

34:35.950 --> 34:37.440
But I was wrong.

34:38.118 --> 34:39.153
(WHISPERS) Henry.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.404
I was wrong, too.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.872
It wasn't your fault. It's mine.

34:46.710 --> 34:49.452
I cast a curse out of vengeance.

34:51.632 --> 34:53.418
And I'm a villain.

I'm sorry.

35:12.736 --> 35:14.112
Don't be.

35:14.863 --> 35:17.320
You got to get our boy
the hell out of here.

35:17.408 --> 35:18.944
And you have to go back there.

35:19.034 --> 35:20.240
Yeah.

35:26.792 --> 35:29.408
Hey, this isn't over.

35:30.713 --> 35:31.828
I'll see both of you again.

35:39.513 --> 35:41.629
It's quite the vessel
you captain there, Swan.

35:45.394 --> 35:47.726
There's not a day will go by
I won't think of you.

35:47.813 --> 35:49.053
Good.

35:56.030 --> 35:57.190
Emma.

35:58.949 --> 36:00.280
There's something I haven't told you.

36:00.367 --> 36:01.527
(SIGHS) What now?

36:02.161 --> 36:04.447
When the curse washes over us,

36:05.039 --> 36:09.248
it will send us all back,
nothing will be left behind.

36:11.295 --> 36:12.785
Including your memories.

36:13.380 --> 36:15.757
It's just what the curse does.

Storybrooke will no longer exist.

36:18.177 --> 36:21.089
It won't ever have existed.

36:22.431 --> 36:24.092
So these last years,

36:25.434 --> 36:27.846
will be gone from both your memories,

36:27.936 --> 36:29.801
and we'll just go back
to being stories again.

36:30.522 --> 36:31.932
What will happen to us?

36:32.566 --> 36:33.601
I don't know.

like a happy ending.

36:36.153 --> 36:37.609

36:39.073 --> 36:41.029
But I can give you one.

36:41.116 --> 36:43.107
You can preserve our memories?

36:43.202 --> 36:48.742
No, I can do what I did
to everyone else in this town

36:51.126 --> 36:53.412
and give you new ones.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.831
You cursed them
and they were miserable.

36:56.382 --> 36:57.622
They didn't have to be.

37:01.303 --> 37:04.966
My gift to you is good memories.
