WEBVTT

00:01.250 --> 00:02.794
Previously, on "Casual"...

00:02.795 --> 00:04.857
I can't feed you, I can't house you.

00:04.882 --> 00:06.303
I don't even know where I'm sleeping at.

00:06.328 --> 00:08.039
- But I want to help.
- Help here.

00:08.039 --> 00:11.389
I mean, there's Skid Row,
immigration, housing...

00:11.414 --> 00:13.125
But I want to help you.

00:13.126 --> 00:15.588
We should do this every day, right?

00:15.589 --> 00:17.633
What, the crossword?

00:21.684 --> 00:23.581
At least until the construction stops.

00:23.753 --> 00:25.566
Did you have these made
before I got here?

00:25.567 --> 00:27.320
No.

00:27.321 --> 00:29.867
You're sad. Why are you sad?

00:30.176 --> 00:32.580
My friend moved away.

00:32.581 --> 00:35.169
Do you love her?

00:37.132 --> 00:39.052
So, Jack and I went to Fresno.

00:39.513 --> 00:40.740
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

00:40.765 --> 00:42.433
Met Rich and his family. They're sweet.

00:42.434 --> 00:44.020
I'm sorry, who's Rich?

00:44.021 --> 00:46.302
He's my half-brother.

00:50.218 --> 00:52.955
I don't know... I don't know
what my fucking problem is.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074

01:03.335 --> 01:04.351
Totally overrated.

01:04.384 --> 01:07.335
Absolutely 100% properly rated.

01:07.585 --> 01:08.903
They're like every other family.

01:08.904 --> 01:11.032
Like... like the Osbournes.

01:11.033 --> 01:12.911
- That's slander.
- And the inbreeding?

01:14.456 --> 01:15.750
There's got to be a lot of inbreeding.

01:15.751 --> 01:17.921
No, not anymore, and also,

01:17.922 --> 01:20.814
no one wears a lace dress
like Kate Middleton.

01:21.554 --> 01:24.183
- That I will concede.
- Thank you.

01:25.771 --> 01:28.066
Oh.- -

01:28.067 --> 01:31.013
Have you seen "Fun Home"?

01:31.742 --> 01:34.287
It's a vibrant musical.

01:34.288 --> 01:37.376
"Hamilton" before "Hamilton."

01:37.377 --> 01:39.255
Oh, I'd love to see "Hamilton."

01:42.262 --> 01:45.770
Um, sorry, can you excuse me just one...

02:16.956 --> 02:19.962
Is everything okay?

02:21.465 --> 02:23.843
Leon...

02:24.806 --> 02:27.393
I want you to know these last few months

02:27.394 --> 02:29.718
have been wonderful.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.863
They've been surprising,

02:32.864 --> 02:35.284
and tender,

02:35.285 --> 02:37.591
and intimate.

02:38.876 --> 02:41.171
They've been perfect.

02:41.172 --> 02:42.673
Exactly.

02:42.674 --> 02:46.431
And perfect is scary for me.

02:48.436 --> 02:51.843
My dad's a fuckup, and the
rest of my family's, like...

02:53.237 --> 02:55.012
Let's just say...

02:55.492 --> 02:57.225
Perfect isn't me.

03:01.452 --> 03:03.084
Okay.

03:03.424 --> 03:05.337
But I want it to be.

03:10.146 --> 03:12.644
They say that your ideal partner

03:12.669 --> 03:15.114
is someone that you would be okay with

03:15.115 --> 03:16.951
if everyone else in the world died.

03:16.952 --> 03:19.915
And I really hope that doesn't happen,

03:19.916 --> 03:23.798
but if it does,

03:23.799 --> 03:27.054
and there's, like, a terrible disease,

03:27.055 --> 03:29.935
or, like, a solar flare or something,

03:29.936 --> 03:33.441
that leads to a mass extinction,

03:33.442 --> 03:35.738
and somehow just the two of us

03:35.739 --> 03:38.660
are the only ones left alive,

03:38.661 --> 03:42.459
I think I'd be okay.

03:42.460 --> 03:44.423
Relatively.

03:45.633 --> 03:47.303
You make my heart burst

03:47.304 --> 03:50.310
when you walk into a room.

03:52.564 --> 03:56.196
Will you walk into every room with me?

03:58.260 --> 04:01.199
Will you marry me?

04:02.007 --> 04:05.005
Is that a yes?

04:05.006 --> 04:08.638
My mom always said to get
verbal confirmation.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.135
Yes.

04:38.364 --> 04:40.200
Yes?

04:42.205 --> 04:44.880
Yes.

04:45.628 --> 04:47.709
Very much yes.

04:48.885 --> 04:50.857
Good.

04:52.100 --> 04:53.728
I'll make breakfast.

04:54.037 --> 04:55.857
No, I have to pick up Clark.

04:55.858 --> 04:58.611
- Oh.
- You still have that son?

04:58.612 --> 05:00.657
Oh, you know, I thought
about getting rid of him,

05:00.658 --> 05:02.871
but the tax credits are...

05:04.333 --> 05:07.922
Oh, my God. Look.

05:07.923 --> 05:10.218
Leon's engaged. Holy fucking fuck.

05:10.219 --> 05:12.222
- You text with Leon?
- Oh, my God.

05:12.223 --> 05:14.602
It's perfect. Leia and Leon.

05:14.603 --> 05:16.022
So alliterative.

05:16.023 --> 05:18.485
Who's Leia?

05:18.486 --> 05:20.990
Val's assistant. With her cat.

05:20.991 --> 05:23.782
Jesus, you don't care.

05:24.081 --> 05:26.204
Leon wants to get coffee later.

05:27.003 --> 05:29.188
You don't think... oh, my God.

05:30.385 --> 05:32.471
You think he wants me
to be the best man?

05:32.811 --> 05:36.145
Alex, I'm naked, and I
need to go and get my son.

05:36.146 --> 05:38.441
Right. Rae, bye.

05:38.442 --> 05:39.795
- Mm.
- Thank you.

05:39.820 --> 05:41.196
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

05:41.323 --> 05:43.327
I'm just so excited.

05:47.920 --> 05:49.986
Is it a green card thing?

05:50.011 --> 05:52.752
No, it's love, actually.

05:53.431 --> 05:55.058
And this has been going on for...

05:55.059 --> 05:57.020
- Seven weeks.
- Oh, my God.

05:57.021 --> 05:58.996
Wow.

06:00.144 --> 06:02.281
- Leia!
- I know it seems fast,

06:02.282 --> 06:04.201
but sometimes you just know, you know?

06:04.202 --> 06:06.038
He's my person. My survival partner.

06:06.512 --> 06:07.708
Will you be a bridesmaid?

06:07.709 --> 06:11.299
I... I've never been a bridesmaid.

06:11.300 --> 06:12.641
Well, I'd like you to be mine.

06:12.666 --> 06:14.531
- Well, I'd be really honored.
- Yay!

06:14.556 --> 06:16.642
Okay, I'm sharing your
info with my sisters.

06:16.643 --> 06:18.521
They're hosting an engagement
fÃªte for us tomorrow.

06:19.009 --> 06:20.902
I thought you only had one sister.

06:20.903 --> 06:22.989
Biologically, yes, but she's
addicted to methamphetamines.

06:22.990 --> 06:24.658
These are my Delta Sig sisters.

06:24.659 --> 06:26.370
They can be kind of much, but you know

06:26.371 --> 06:28.208
You can't choose your family.

06:28.209 --> 06:29.543
But you did choose them.

06:29.544 --> 06:31.908
No, they chose me.

06:37.477 --> 06:38.686
Leia!

06:40.441 --> 06:42.987
Hey, this is Alex.
Leave a message. Or don't.

06:42.988 --> 06:44.240
I'll look at my call log
and decide whether or not

06:44.241 --> 06:45.910
to call you back.

06:45.911 --> 06:47.747
Did you hear? Okay. You must have heard.

06:47.748 --> 06:50.878
I mean, Alex, this is crazy.

06:51.523 --> 06:53.132
Did you know about any of this?

06:53.413 --> 06:55.805
And now I'm a... I'm a bridesmaid.

06:56.077 --> 06:58.351
Oh, my God. Call me.

07:16.138 --> 07:18.405
Oh, fuck me.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.771
My friend was supposed
to come with me, but,

07:20.772 --> 07:22.775
she got roped up in some work shit,

07:22.776 --> 07:24.958
and so now I'm out a copilot.

07:25.656 --> 07:27.367
I thought you weren't supposed to go

07:27.368 --> 07:30.415
to strangers' houses you
meet on Craigslist.

07:30.416 --> 07:32.252
Safety's ideal, but it's not

07:32.253 --> 07:34.715
- an actual thing.
- Right.

07:34.716 --> 07:36.594
Also, Pep Boys is walking distance.

07:36.595 --> 07:37.889
Fuckers tried to upsell me, though.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.602
Brakes, shocks, filters.

07:40.603 --> 07:43.066
Like, bro. Oil change. Oil.

07:43.276 --> 07:45.393
Grease it up and let's go.

07:45.948 --> 07:47.699
Sexism, right?

07:47.700 --> 07:49.620
- Pussy grabs back.
- Damn right it does.

07:50.238 --> 07:52.417
So why you going to Sac-to?

07:52.418 --> 07:54.421
- Volunteering.
- Trust fund kid?

07:54.422 --> 07:56.894
No, just upwardly mobile.

07:57.387 --> 07:59.043
So you're leaving tomorrow?

07:59.183 --> 08:00.543
At the stroke of midnight.

08:00.568 --> 08:02.988
I drive on a lunar schedule on
account of my vampire blood.

08:04.034 --> 08:05.736
And I fucking hate traffic.

08:06.190 --> 08:08.706
I'll just need a hundo
for gas and tolls.

08:09.119 --> 08:10.620
That much?

08:10.621 --> 08:11.622
Is that a problem?

08:11.623 --> 08:13.566
No, not at all.

08:22.687 --> 08:24.285
Leon.

08:25.359 --> 08:26.736
Leon! Hello!

08:27.113 --> 08:28.543
Hey.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.746
Congratulations, man.

08:31.747 --> 08:34.418
I'm a little surprised... I
mean, I'm a lot of surprised.

08:34.863 --> 08:36.144
Why didn't you say anything?

08:36.169 --> 08:37.837
Also, what are you thinking
for the bachelor party?

08:37.889 --> 08:40.101
I hear Cartagena is
amazing now that it's not

08:40.181 --> 08:42.558
overrun by cartels... we can
finally get that cocaine.

08:42.559 --> 08:44.062
- About that...
- I'm kidding. I'm just kidding.

08:44.063 --> 08:46.014
Seriously, that's amazing.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.364
And speech-wise, what are you expecting?

08:49.365 --> 08:52.162
Jokey? Sentimental? I mean,
I suppose a good speech

08:52.163 --> 08:53.837
- does a little of both...
- Alex.

08:54.330 --> 08:56.504
You're not my best man.

08:56.505 --> 08:57.814
Okay.

08:58.542 --> 09:01.494
Yeah, I'm happy just to be a groomsman.

09:02.689 --> 09:03.684
I'm not a groomsman?

09:03.685 --> 09:05.688
It'll be a small wedding party.

09:05.689 --> 09:08.402
- I introduced you to Leia.
- Valerie introduced me to...

09:08.403 --> 09:09.571
I introduced you to Valerie.

09:09.572 --> 09:11.763
No, you didn't.

09:13.455 --> 09:15.751
- That Aussie guy?
- That the best man?

09:15.752 --> 09:17.350
Ryan. Yes.

09:17.965 --> 09:20.677
Oh, man.

09:20.961 --> 09:24.101
This must be what girls
felt like in middle school.

09:24.555 --> 09:26.021
You're a friend.

09:26.414 --> 09:28.067
A good friend.

09:28.233 --> 09:29.737
Please don't take this the wrong way.

09:29.738 --> 09:31.577
Yeah, no. Of course not.

09:32.687 --> 09:34.454
We're having an engagement
party tomorrow.

09:34.455 --> 09:37.753
Um, it would be good to have you there.

09:37.754 --> 09:39.715
Nice, yeah. Cool.

09:39.716 --> 09:42.083
Schedule permitting, but sure.

09:43.432 --> 09:47.278
Oh. Blowing up.

09:48.108 --> 09:50.236
Ah, shit. Office needs me. I got to run.

09:50.512 --> 09:52.742
Uh, congrats, man.

09:52.743 --> 09:54.951
Seriously. So happy for you.

10:02.303 --> 10:05.851
Never join a sorority.

10:05.852 --> 10:08.272
- Duly noted.
- Do you have a Bitmoji?

10:08.566 --> 10:10.234
'Cause what is the point?

10:10.425 --> 10:12.238
What, of a slightly more attractive,

10:12.239 --> 10:14.409
Anglicized avatar that takes funny shit

10:14.410 --> 10:15.996
from gay culture and makes it our own?

10:16.331 --> 10:18.125
Yas, Queen.

10:18.126 --> 10:20.798
And look, don't their faces
look eating disorder-y?

10:20.799 --> 10:22.509
What's with that? What
are you doing here?

10:22.510 --> 10:24.179
Getting back into photography?

10:24.401 --> 10:25.849
Uh, yeah, you could say that.

10:25.850 --> 10:28.772
I call this one "Still Life With Table."

10:28.773 --> 10:30.818
Oh, good.

10:30.819 --> 10:33.073
"Get it, gurl!"

10:35.411 --> 10:37.038
Oh, my God.

10:37.039 --> 10:38.644
Oh, Jesus.

11:02.883 --> 11:04.806
- Oh.
- Hey.

11:05.095 --> 11:07.009
I brought ice cream.

11:07.934 --> 11:10.146
- Hi.
- Leon and Leia are having

11:10.147 --> 11:12.317
an engagement party later.

11:12.318 --> 11:13.987
I know it's short notice,
but if you feel like

11:13.988 --> 11:15.783
celebrating the love
of two near strangers,

11:15.784 --> 11:18.621
then the invite's on the table.

11:18.622 --> 11:20.625
Could be hard for me to get a sitter.

11:20.802 --> 11:22.903
We only need to make a cameo.

11:23.215 --> 11:26.095
You gonna get spoons, or
should I eat with my hands?

11:26.096 --> 11:28.224
I am not above eating with my hands.

11:28.225 --> 11:29.886
Clark's gonna be here any minute.

11:29.911 --> 11:32.707
Right. I got mint chip. He
loves mint chip, I think.

11:32.901 --> 11:34.653
He does love mint chip, and so do I,

11:34.654 --> 11:36.406
but I don't think it's
time for him to eat

11:36.407 --> 11:39.079
mint chip with the two of us together.

11:39.301 --> 11:42.253
Especially when the mint
chip shows up unannounced.

11:44.758 --> 11:46.291
Oh.

11:47.093 --> 11:48.344
Of course.

11:48.369 --> 11:49.851
Yes, that makes sense.

11:49.852 --> 11:51.484
Um...

11:53.392 --> 11:55.153
If I don't put him first right now,

11:55.154 --> 11:57.323
he won't call me when he
gets to college, and...

11:57.324 --> 12:00.288
Yep. Right. Keep that
for the two of you.

12:00.289 --> 12:02.957
One's enough for me.

12:04.895 --> 12:06.941
- Thank you, Alex.
- Uh-huh.

12:08.680 --> 12:12.478
No, no, Randy Brown
was New Mexico State.

12:12.479 --> 12:14.274
Luc Longley was New Mexico.

12:14.275 --> 12:17.614
And Luc Longley named
a species of shrimp.

12:17.889 --> 12:21.789
Yeah, he's a big shrimper, Luc Longley.

12:21.790 --> 12:24.319
I have no idea.

12:25.297 --> 12:27.760
Okay, yeah I got to go,
but let's continue

12:27.761 --> 12:29.638
this conversation tomorrow at length.

12:29.639 --> 12:32.213
Okay. Bye.

12:34.257 --> 12:35.274
Hi.

12:35.275 --> 12:36.999
- Hi.
- What's up?

12:37.446 --> 12:40.534
Well, my stomach won the war

12:40.535 --> 12:43.457
against my brain and it's
seeking reparations,

12:43.458 --> 12:46.255
so how do you feel about tacos?

12:46.256 --> 12:49.971
Oh, shit, I kind of just ate
with some guys from work.

12:49.972 --> 12:51.556
You just kind of ate?

12:51.557 --> 12:53.644
I ate a cheeseburger to completion.

12:53.645 --> 12:55.439
I thought we were gonna eat together.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.736
Well, you should have
texted me, I would have.

12:57.737 --> 12:59.531
Well, why didn't you text me?

12:59.532 --> 13:02.537
'Cause I would have gladly
eaten a cheeseburger.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.332
I will next time. Sorry.

13:04.333 --> 13:06.003
That's fine, I'm just gonna...

13:06.004 --> 13:09.604
I'll eat an appeasement yogurt.

13:10.220 --> 13:11.555
What do you want to do tonight?

13:11.556 --> 13:13.347
We have plans?

13:14.137 --> 13:16.246
You're here, aren't you?

13:17.824 --> 13:20.742
We could watch movies.
Hang out on the couch?

13:22.824 --> 13:24.363
Okay.

13:25.459 --> 13:27.077
Are you mad at me?

13:27.773 --> 13:32.472
No, it's... no, it's
just these bridesmaids.

13:32.473 --> 13:37.900
I mean, they want me to pick
up mason jars and mini-pies.

13:37.901 --> 13:40.279
It's like a Pinterest-sponsored
shakedown.

13:40.280 --> 13:41.628
- Mini-pies?
- Yeah.

13:41.653 --> 13:43.229
And Alex still hasn't called me back.

13:43.254 --> 13:46.009
- Which is just...
- Well, that...

13:46.292 --> 13:48.087
Is maybe a good thing.
Maybe he's finally

13:48.088 --> 13:51.302
jumping off the codependency carousel.

13:55.352 --> 13:57.314
Have you seen my running shoes?

13:59.061 --> 14:00.653
She has a kid, dumb-ass.

14:00.654 --> 14:02.198
You can't just show up uninvited.

14:02.199 --> 14:03.944
I was reeling.

14:04.286 --> 14:07.250
Leon and I have a one-sided
friendship, yes,

14:07.539 --> 14:11.508
but that's inevitable because
he never asks anything of me.

14:11.509 --> 14:14.305
He's a saint, Saint Leon, and I can't be

14:14.306 --> 14:16.101
held to the standards of Sainthood.

14:16.102 --> 14:18.891
Why do you think he didn't
tell you about Leia?

14:19.233 --> 14:22.280
I don't know, maybe he
thought I wouldn't approve.

14:22.281 --> 14:25.411
Or he was nervous. Or racial politics.

14:25.412 --> 14:27.081
He told me a month ago.

14:27.509 --> 14:29.669
When I asked about his life.

14:29.670 --> 14:31.548
- Oh.
- When I moved from Brooklyn,

14:31.775 --> 14:33.594
all my friends were like
so pumped that I was

14:33.595 --> 14:35.564
manifesting my destiny, right?

14:35.766 --> 14:37.393
Well, when I packed my U-Haul to go,

14:37.759 --> 14:39.773
only my best friend Julia showed up.

14:39.986 --> 14:41.822
Never even had to ask.

14:42.404 --> 14:44.992
When you really care about somebody,

14:44.993 --> 14:46.621
you pack the U-Haul.

14:56.390 --> 14:59.604
- Hey.
- Yay.

14:59.811 --> 15:02.068
Wow, you must be the only antique store

15:02.069 --> 15:04.239
with a personal delivery service, huh?

15:04.240 --> 15:07.495
- You'd be surprised.
- Huh.

15:07.496 --> 15:09.707
Hmm. Nice office.

15:09.708 --> 15:12.004
- Very generic.
- Thank you.

15:12.005 --> 15:15.344
Actually, I killed my therapist
and took over the space,

15:15.345 --> 15:18.058
so I'm still just kind of
finding my way around here.

15:18.237 --> 15:20.855
- She probably deserved it.
- I got a random question.

15:21.571 --> 15:23.110
You ever leave your shoes on a bed?

15:23.805 --> 15:25.698
- No.
- Right?

15:25.699 --> 15:28.036
Because the sanctity of the bed

15:28.037 --> 15:30.165
cannot be muddied by shoes.

15:30.166 --> 15:32.295
I had an ex who wore a
mouth guard to bed.

15:32.296 --> 15:34.925
- She left that shit everywhere.
- Eww.

15:34.926 --> 15:38.515
Yeah, no, my problem is more clothes.

15:38.516 --> 15:40.477
Just leaves them around for me to find

15:40.478 --> 15:42.565
like little sweaty prizes.

15:42.566 --> 15:44.036
You're already living together?

15:44.100 --> 15:45.731
No, but he's half moved-in,

15:45.756 --> 15:47.926
so I can't ask him to leave now.

15:48.231 --> 15:49.471
Why not?

15:49.496 --> 15:51.207
Then he'll go to a hotel, and

15:51.208 --> 15:53.253
I'll freak out that I
kicked him off the wagon.

15:53.254 --> 15:55.549
Right, totally, so
instead, you just let him

15:55.550 --> 15:57.053
define the relationship on his terms.

15:57.054 --> 15:58.964
- I get it.
- No.

15:58.989 --> 16:02.119
I am supporting his recovery
in whatever way is necessary.

16:02.260 --> 16:04.573
- Convincing.
- Oh, shut up.

16:04.693 --> 16:07.656
Forget it, what do I know? I'm...
I'm just the jar guy.

16:07.657 --> 16:09.000
Wait, that's what you are.

16:09.025 --> 16:11.665
Yes, you're the... oh,
you're the jar guy.

16:12.032 --> 16:14.755
Um, I do have to go to a braid bar,

16:15.493 --> 16:19.389
because nothing says "nuptials"
like adult women in braids.

16:19.390 --> 16:21.296
Maybe they could braid you a noose.

16:21.560 --> 16:23.647
Oh, yes, just...

16:25.443 --> 16:26.570
Thank you.

16:40.014 --> 16:41.575
Uh, that's a good camera.

16:41.935 --> 16:43.186
It's a piece of junk.

16:43.187 --> 16:45.357
Well, maybe you could buy it anyway.

16:45.358 --> 16:48.405
I'm just a young girl, a
young girl with dreams.

16:48.406 --> 16:49.825
Yeah? What dreams?

16:49.826 --> 16:51.295
World peace?

16:51.320 --> 16:53.615
$200 for the lot.

16:53.750 --> 16:55.627
$200? No, I need at least $500.

16:55.628 --> 16:57.465
Honey, this is a fire sale.

16:57.466 --> 16:59.635
I know desperation when I see it.

16:59.636 --> 17:01.420
It's a buyer's market.

17:01.933 --> 17:03.491
$450?

17:04.480 --> 17:07.304
How about I give you $500 for the table?

17:08.570 --> 17:10.491
It's worth at least $2,000.

17:10.492 --> 17:12.746
No, it's worth what someone's
willing to pay for it.

17:12.747 --> 17:15.579
Which, at the moment, is $500.

17:16.420 --> 17:18.173
Table's not for sale.

17:18.174 --> 17:21.347
Okay. $200 for the lot.
Take it or leave it.

17:23.298 --> 17:25.219
Take it.

17:34.874 --> 17:37.461
The sound bothering you?

17:37.650 --> 17:40.050
I can't do anything
to quiet it, but I am

17:40.051 --> 17:42.290
inquiring about your perspective.

17:43.140 --> 17:46.312
Oh. I'm fine, but thank you.

17:46.688 --> 17:48.820
Yeah. Hey.

17:49.524 --> 17:51.695
That's a really great burned head.

17:52.266 --> 17:54.955
Yeah.

17:54.956 --> 17:57.627
Yeah, I mean it.

18:15.288 --> 18:17.655
Oh. Hi.

18:18.429 --> 18:19.838
Did we have plans?

18:20.155 --> 18:22.009
Is that how you greet
your only daughter?

18:22.010 --> 18:24.055
Oh! Hi! Do we have plans!

18:24.425 --> 18:26.059
Yes, a little forced, but better.

18:26.060 --> 18:27.353
How much do you need?

18:27.354 --> 18:28.898
No.

18:28.899 --> 18:31.737
I'm not that kid. Tell
me I'm not that kid.

18:31.738 --> 18:33.573
- How'd you know?
- Teenager shows up

18:33.574 --> 18:35.285
unannounced on her
divorced dad's doorstep?

18:35.286 --> 18:36.747
That's a classic.

18:36.748 --> 18:38.375
Yeah, so is depressed

18:38.376 --> 18:40.003
single dad day-drinking.

18:40.230 --> 18:41.757
I've missed you.

18:43.780 --> 18:47.443
I can't pretend I wasn't
hurt by groomsman-gate.

18:48.312 --> 18:51.359
But a truth was revealed,
as with all great gates.

18:51.360 --> 18:54.615
I know the friendship

18:54.616 --> 18:58.373
between us is at times tipped.

18:58.725 --> 19:01.856
So, I wanted to give you this.

19:05.680 --> 19:07.224
A bedroom?

19:07.225 --> 19:09.061
It's an office.

19:09.062 --> 19:11.846
Yeah. See? Desk and everything?

19:12.471 --> 19:14.447
Rae said they're doing
construction at your place,

19:14.448 --> 19:17.411
so you've been working at a coffee shop.

19:17.412 --> 19:20.752
And I thought, why not
work here, rent-free?

19:22.213 --> 19:25.094
I... I don't know what to say.

19:27.507 --> 19:28.976
Say yes.

19:28.977 --> 19:31.757
Say no. Say whatever you want.

19:32.567 --> 19:35.615
It's your decision, and I
will respect it either way.

19:37.243 --> 19:40.040
The baristas think I'm a screenwriter.

19:40.041 --> 19:43.088
They keep pitching themselves for roles.

19:43.089 --> 19:45.092
But you're a composer.

19:45.093 --> 19:48.313
I am a composer.

19:49.351 --> 19:51.136
So you can let yourself in.

19:51.731 --> 19:54.261
All right, tell me
about this engagement.

19:54.611 --> 19:56.489
Did you get down on one knee?

19:56.490 --> 19:58.786
Actually, Leia proposed to me.

19:58.787 --> 20:02.626
Le-on! Let me see that ring.

20:02.627 --> 20:04.630
I mean, clearly my
priorities were wrong.

20:04.655 --> 20:07.292
I spent all summer... thank you...
going door to door

20:07.534 --> 20:09.348
and speaking at city council meetings

20:09.349 --> 20:11.269
to hold billionaire oil
companies accountable,

20:11.270 --> 20:13.858
and I should have just
been a sandwich artist.

20:14.253 --> 20:16.320
They didn't pay you?

20:16.321 --> 20:19.373
Organized labor will enjoy a
nice footnote of history.

20:21.875 --> 20:23.725
How much is half? $2,000?

20:23.879 --> 20:26.090
$2,250.

20:26.091 --> 20:28.303
But my body will be pristine again,

20:28.304 --> 20:30.599
and I promise not to have another crisis

20:30.600 --> 20:32.144
for at least a month.

20:32.145 --> 20:35.084
I don't believe you, but still, I pay.

20:35.109 --> 20:37.487
That's called faith.

20:37.488 --> 20:39.533
Oh, hi.

20:39.534 --> 20:41.621
You didn't tell me that
Laura was coming by.

20:41.622 --> 20:43.666
I think I might have only
gotten enough for two,

20:43.667 --> 20:46.422
- but I can go back and...
- No. It's fine.

20:46.423 --> 20:48.218
I don't think she wants to suffer

20:48.219 --> 20:50.646
through a full meal with us.

20:51.683 --> 20:53.980
No, you guys enjoy.

21:11.473 --> 21:12.792
Hi.

21:12.817 --> 21:15.822
An apology aloe was unnecessary.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.902
Thought it was more
discrete than roses.

21:17.903 --> 21:20.156
I'm sorry about yesterday.

21:20.157 --> 21:22.745
Thank you.

21:22.746 --> 21:24.749
And don't worry about
that engagement party.

21:24.750 --> 21:26.335
It's an open bar, so I'll just

21:26.336 --> 21:27.922
drink until I'm numb enough to dance.

21:27.923 --> 21:29.759
Now you tell me you can dance?

21:29.760 --> 21:32.514
Well, I don't, really.
It's more moving

21:32.515 --> 21:34.601
my limbs indiscriminately to rhythm.

21:34.990 --> 21:37.942
Well, I could maybe get
away for a couple hours.

21:38.107 --> 21:40.071
- Yeah?
- But you have to dance for me.

21:40.072 --> 21:42.828
Absolutely not.

21:45.041 --> 21:47.294
Okay. Bye.

23:08.875 --> 23:11.130
Hey, this is Alex.
Leave a message.

23:18.783 --> 23:20.605
Someone's been reading Goop.

23:20.606 --> 23:22.556
Why didn't you fix this?

23:23.153 --> 23:24.948
I haven't had time.

23:24.949 --> 23:27.536
You don't have a job.
All you have is time.

23:27.537 --> 23:30.250
- Actually...
- Buckets and buckets of time.

23:30.251 --> 23:33.130
- It's just a table.
- That's not the point.

23:33.277 --> 23:36.053
All I ask is that you
take responsibility.

23:36.054 --> 23:37.681
I let you do whatever you want.

23:37.682 --> 23:40.104
Can you please just fix the table?

23:41.857 --> 23:43.306
Fine.

23:43.987 --> 23:45.572
Thank you.

23:47.899 --> 23:49.258
Awh...

23:53.338 --> 23:55.342
Ow.

23:59.100 --> 24:00.518
- Don't start.
- No, you look beautiful,

24:00.519 --> 24:01.771
- by the way.
- Yeah.

24:01.772 --> 24:04.192
I love it. It's like... DNA.

24:04.193 --> 24:06.238
- Mm.
- The building blocks of life.

24:06.239 --> 24:07.719
Great.

24:08.828 --> 24:11.352
I think I left my iPad back here.

24:11.959 --> 24:15.632
Hey. What's this?

24:15.633 --> 24:17.719
Champagne for the love birds.

24:17.720 --> 24:20.183
Oh.

24:20.184 --> 24:22.562
- That's thoughtful.
- Well, it's a party, right?

24:22.563 --> 24:24.776
With food, by the way?
'Cause I'm starving.

24:25.309 --> 24:27.489
- Mm.
- Want some cheeseburgers.

24:27.927 --> 24:30.599
Tacos. Mini-pies.

24:36.549 --> 24:38.822
And don't worry about Alex, okay?

24:39.896 --> 24:43.069
He probably just got
distracted by a shiny object.

24:45.275 --> 24:47.279
Thank you.

25:02.059 --> 25:03.729
Oh, my God.

25:03.730 --> 25:07.444
I mean, sorority girls
do not fuck around.

25:07.445 --> 25:09.156
That's a lot of purple loofahs.

25:09.157 --> 25:10.533
- Hi.
- These take-home loofahs?

25:10.534 --> 25:12.078
Can we, uh...

25:12.079 --> 25:13.503
This should be a ride at Disneyland.

25:13.528 --> 25:16.325
I feel this is all Leon.

25:16.421 --> 25:19.200
- Should we get some Champagne?
- Yeah.

25:20.554 --> 25:22.056
I went a little heavy...

25:22.057 --> 25:23.642
You have something on your tie.

25:23.643 --> 25:26.269
- Just kidding. Hi!
- Hi.

25:26.294 --> 25:28.360
I love your dress.

25:28.361 --> 25:30.741
- It matches everything.
- Doesn't it?

25:30.742 --> 25:32.202
I'm like a chameleon

25:32.203 --> 25:34.122
who's infiltrating a wasp nest.

25:34.123 --> 25:36.668
- Hi, Val.
- Hey, Alex.

25:36.669 --> 25:39.090
- Hi.
- Jack. Been too long.

25:39.091 --> 25:41.220
I know, I miss you. Legit miss you.

25:41.221 --> 25:42.932
- I... I can't sleep at night.
- We got to get

25:42.933 --> 25:44.852
the eggs together and make
some barbecue babies.

25:44.853 --> 25:46.355
- Thank you for saying that.
- Are they cheating on us?

25:46.356 --> 25:48.442
- Sure feels that way.
- Does, kind of.

25:48.443 --> 25:51.365
- Ah! Hi!
- Hey!

25:51.366 --> 25:53.369
- Hey. Whoa. Hey.
- Hi.

25:53.370 --> 25:55.414
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

25:55.415 --> 25:57.460
- All right.
- Oh, my gosh.

25:57.461 --> 26:00.007
- Oh, guys, um, Judy.
- Hi.

26:00.008 --> 26:01.635
- Leon, Leia.
- Hey.

26:01.636 --> 26:03.890
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you guys.

26:03.891 --> 26:05.894
- Best wishes. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

26:05.895 --> 26:07.773
You've heard a
lot about one another.

26:07.774 --> 26:10.069
- This is great.
- This is so great.

26:10.070 --> 26:11.739
- It is great.
- Yeah!

26:11.740 --> 26:12.825
And you know, we would
never have happened

26:12.826 --> 26:14.202
if it wasn't for you.

26:14.203 --> 26:15.663
Well, I... come on, I...

26:15.664 --> 26:17.375
Hey, this calls for a toast.

26:17.376 --> 26:18.837
This calls for many toasts.

26:18.838 --> 26:20.883
- To Leon and Leia...
- And Valerie.

26:20.884 --> 26:23.095
Without whom none of us would be here.

26:23.713 --> 26:27.406
Cheers.

26:32.111 --> 26:34.252
I thought you couldn't part with it.

26:34.577 --> 26:36.346
It's a fucking table.

26:36.749 --> 26:38.807
Mom's gonna be pissed.

26:39.253 --> 26:41.143
Do you want it or not?

26:41.549 --> 26:42.969
Grab an end.

26:50.777 --> 26:52.070
Look.

26:52.071 --> 26:53.530
Thank you for coming with me.

26:53.531 --> 26:54.951
You said there was an open bar.

26:54.952 --> 26:56.495
- And how about this?
- What?

26:56.496 --> 26:58.165
- Indiscriminate arm movement.
- Wow!

26:58.166 --> 27:01.088
- That was not indiscriminate.
- It was not.

27:01.089 --> 27:02.800
They replenished the mini-pies.

27:02.801 --> 27:04.552
- Mm-hmm.
- Bring me some.

27:04.553 --> 27:07.266
- Strawberry rhubarb?
- Curate a selection.

27:07.267 --> 27:10.857
Right.

27:10.858 --> 27:13.195
- All right. Hey.
- Hey.

27:13.196 --> 27:14.782
Stop ignoring me.

27:15.167 --> 27:16.627
What? I'm not.

27:16.652 --> 27:19.416
I left you an actual voicemail.

27:19.417 --> 27:21.545
Okay, yeah.

27:21.546 --> 27:23.048
What do you want me to tell you?

27:23.049 --> 27:24.384
Judy's been around a lot.

27:24.385 --> 27:26.806
I haven't really had time to talk.

27:26.807 --> 27:29.979
Oh, okay, so that's what
we're gonna do from now on?

27:29.980 --> 27:33.444
Just like a monthly dinner,
some text messages?

27:33.445 --> 27:34.989
This is what you wanted.

27:34.990 --> 27:36.743
And you know what? You were right.

27:36.744 --> 27:39.497
You and Jack are happy.
Me and Judy are happy.

27:39.498 --> 27:41.334
Everything's working out.

27:41.335 --> 27:44.968
So, just try to have a good time.

27:51.355 --> 27:52.482
- Did you see that?
- What?

27:52.483 --> 27:53.943
- You missed it?
- Oh, no.

27:53.968 --> 27:56.528
Oh, I executed a perfect Electric Slide.

27:56.553 --> 27:57.617
I think it was an Electric
Slide, I don't know.

27:57.618 --> 27:59.287
It was biblical. The Red Sea parted.

27:59.288 --> 28:01.647
- I slid right through.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

28:01.788 --> 28:03.169
- I'm so happy for you though.
- Thank you.

28:03.194 --> 28:04.339
Thank you for that. I appreciate that.

28:04.340 --> 28:06.176
I'm gonna go back out here. Join me?

28:06.177 --> 28:08.096
I feel an impending Macarena coming on.

28:08.097 --> 28:10.309
Uh, let me think about it for a second.

28:10.969 --> 28:13.281
You sure? I'm very
mediocre at dancing.

28:13.362 --> 28:15.366
Have fun.

28:40.120 --> 28:41.956
Leon's always
been the kind of bloke

28:41.957 --> 28:44.085
to console you during a break-up,

28:44.086 --> 28:47.393
to throw back a stubbie with
you when you're feeling blue,

28:47.634 --> 28:50.180
and to hold your hair back when
you're just a little too pissed.

28:50.463 --> 28:53.645
- We get it. You're Australian.
- I'm so gonna fuck him later.

28:53.646 --> 28:55.566
You know, I never
thought I'd meet a gal

28:55.567 --> 28:58.279
good enough for my mate
Leon, but as usual...

28:58.866 --> 29:00.117
- Hi.
- Let's go.

29:00.118 --> 29:02.371
- I was wrong.
- Where?

29:02.372 --> 29:04.042
Now, if you two weren't
so bloody decent, - Val, wait.

29:04.043 --> 29:05.921
I'd hate you both.

29:06.387 --> 29:09.385
But I love you, and I can't believe

29:09.386 --> 29:11.681
that this wonderful dream

29:11.682 --> 29:13.018
is becoming a reality.

29:13.019 --> 29:14.437
Aww!

29:14.438 --> 29:16.191
- What? No, no.
- Wait, wait. What?

29:16.192 --> 29:17.736
- What?
- What?

29:17.737 --> 29:19.865
Come on. Let's go to the bathroom.

29:19.866 --> 29:21.744
- No.
- Fine.

29:21.745 --> 29:25.000
- Let's go to my house.
- Now?

29:25.001 --> 29:27.318
Just...

29:27.924 --> 29:30.068
Can we listen to the toasts?

29:33.518 --> 29:34.560
You're only there for me

29:34.561 --> 29:36.774
when it's on your terms.

29:37.005 --> 29:39.445
What? What?

29:39.446 --> 29:41.157
Why are you being crazy right now?

29:41.158 --> 29:43.537
We're at a party for your friends.

29:43.764 --> 29:45.601
Can we just have a nice evening?

30:36.142 --> 30:37.686
About Ryan's speech.

30:37.687 --> 30:41.319
Little heavy on the
outback, but it played.

30:41.519 --> 30:44.284
Pathos and humor. You chose well.

30:44.995 --> 30:47.892
And I am grateful to be a part of this

30:47.917 --> 30:49.627
in whatever way you'll have me.

30:49.628 --> 30:52.589
So just say the word,
and I'm here to help.

30:53.594 --> 30:56.224
Well, we do need someone
to oversee the ceremony.

30:56.225 --> 30:57.769
- You mean an officiant?
- Darling, that...

30:57.770 --> 30:59.272
Oh, my God. Wow.

30:59.273 --> 31:00.900
Yes, I'd be honored.

31:00.901 --> 31:02.570
I can't believe it. When's the wedding?

31:02.571 --> 31:05.785
- Oh, we were thinking Easter.
- In London.

31:05.786 --> 31:07.663
London! Wait, hey.

31:07.664 --> 31:10.753
Easter is spring break, right?
We can show Clark London.

31:11.023 --> 31:13.300
- Uh...
- Big Ben. West End.

31:13.563 --> 31:15.763
Hogwarts. The Royals?

31:15.764 --> 31:17.786
Yeah.

31:22.945 --> 31:24.990
Hi, this is Valerie.
I'm not here right now.

31:24.991 --> 31:27.329
Please leave a message.

31:36.932 --> 31:38.952
<i>Â¿Quieres?</i>

31:39.645 --> 31:41.725
I'm good.

31:51.554 --> 31:54.476
Whoo!

31:56.888 --> 31:59.200
Yeah.
