Narrator:
In New York City war on crime,

00:03.637 --> 00:07.141
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:07.174 --> 00:09.017
of the Major Case Squad.

00:09.042 --> 00:11.522
These are their stories.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.990
This one is you, Karen.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.621
Martinis in Millbrook or punch in Palm Beach,

00:17.651 --> 00:19.153
it's so versatile.

00:19.186 --> 00:21.564
Oh, Sydney, really, I got to go.

00:21.588 --> 00:23.898
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

00:23.924 --> 00:25.426
If Bernie ever found out--

00:25.459 --> 00:27.632
Oh, just be happy for me.

00:31.098 --> 00:33.374

00:52.286 --> 00:54.129
I know I'm late.

00:54.154 --> 00:56.828
I had to give your appointment
away to a walk-in client.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.894
Rochelle, this is an emergency.

00:58.926 --> 01:01.304
I have a date.

01:01.328 --> 01:02.966
With him?

01:02.996 --> 01:04.998
I can't help myself.

01:10.771 --> 01:13.877
He's French. Even when he's
just ordering a sandwich

01:13.907 --> 01:15.944
it makes you feel like you're in a movie.

01:22.349 --> 01:24.158
He says he loves me.

01:24.184 --> 01:26.596
Talk is cheap. So what color?

01:26.620 --> 01:29.226
- Oh, just give me the usual.
- ( sighs )

01:36.096 --> 01:38.372
Oh, damn. Erma, I have to go. I'm hours late.

01:38.398 --> 01:41.538
He won't care how long he's waited
when he sees you in this.

01:41.568 --> 01:44.105
- Oooh. Mmm.
- Want to try it on?

01:44.137 --> 01:46.481
Oh, I can't, I'm late. Just wrap it.

02:06.159 --> 02:08.729
Cheri? Yoo-hoo?

02:11.498 --> 02:13.535
Denis?

02:17.904 --> 02:19.508
Ow.

02:21.274 --> 02:24.414
Oh, damn. I can't believe it. I broke my nail.

02:28.048 --> 02:29.857
Denis?

02:35.522 --> 02:37.729
( scream )

02:39.660 --> 02:41.799
( theme music playing )

03:28.608 --> 03:30.588
His name is Denis Dupont.

03:30.610 --> 03:32.988
He checked in sometime
around 1:00 this afternoon.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.788
He's stayed with us before.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.886
- Always the same lady?
- Lady?

03:36.917 --> 03:39.898
- The champagne, the strawberries?
- I never paid attention.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.230
I know sometimes he held
business meetings here.

03:42.255 --> 03:45.065
- How long will you people be?
- It depends. What business?

03:45.092 --> 03:47.038
This room is reserved for tomorrow night.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.700
The more you can help me,
the faster we'll be out of here.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.710
Finance, I believe.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.769
Any phone calls, in or out?

03:53.800 --> 03:56.872
The operator put one call through,
a woman, at 10 to 2:00.

03:56.903 --> 04:00.441
Then Mr. Dupont phoned down,
asked not to be disturbed.

04:00.474 --> 04:02.112
Do you have a home address for him?

04:02.142 --> 04:04.520
No, but l believe he lives in town someplace.

04:04.544 --> 04:05.921
How did he pay?

04:05.946 --> 04:08.654
Uh... credit card, from Paris bank.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.662
And he never gave you a local address?

04:10.684 --> 04:12.595
No, and we never asked.

04:16.022 --> 04:18.161
This is a woman's fingernail.

04:19.392 --> 04:22.373
I brought him champagne
and strawberries just before 2:00.

04:22.395 --> 04:25.308
- He was by himself.
- You see anybody go in or out of his room?

04:25.332 --> 04:27.778
Anybody on the floor who didn't belong?

04:27.801 --> 04:29.747
I saw a woman by the elevator,

04:29.770 --> 04:31.306
and she was not a guest.

04:31.338 --> 04:33.181
She was in a hurry, she kept pressing...

04:33.206 --> 04:35.083
You know, the button, to go down very fast.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.918
- What did she look like?
- I think she was redhead.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.447
- Fat, thin?
- Medium maybe.

04:40.480 --> 04:44.018
In big fur coat, Russian sable--
very rich lady.

04:45.185 --> 04:47.392
There's no wallet.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.991
Just an international driver's license...

04:50.023 --> 04:52.765
With a very bad picture.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.468
Denis Dupont, Paris, France, 33.

04:56.496 --> 04:58.203
The maid said he was good looking.

04:58.231 --> 05:01.235
- This makes him look like all of
the Three Stooges.
- ( laughs )

05:01.268 --> 05:03.270
Maybe he had a pay date--

05:03.303 --> 05:05.340
ordered a girl, got the pimp?

05:05.372 --> 05:07.409
Champagne and strawberries for a hooker? No.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.943
Anyway, there's too much
blood and guts for a robbery.

05:09.976 --> 05:13.150
Denis Dupont was attacked practically
the moment he opened this door.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.057
Blood spattered on the doorjamb.

05:15.081 --> 05:17.083
The beating carried into here...

05:18.518 --> 05:21.055
And ended with a broken glass ashtray.

05:21.087 --> 05:23.931
And the way the face is mutilated
makes it personal.

05:23.957 --> 05:26.563
A jealous husband.

05:27.561 --> 05:30.940
If Dupont chose his girlfriends
as carefully as he chose his jackets,

05:30.964 --> 05:33.308
he'd still be alive. Enzo Pari.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.370
Custom-made.

05:36.503 --> 05:39.074
Things like this do not
happen to our customers.

05:39.105 --> 05:41.278
I mean, he was just in here three weeks ago.

05:41.308 --> 05:43.618
Picked up his new suit,
ordered two summer suits.

05:43.643 --> 05:45.884
No, I do not have an address for him.

05:45.912 --> 05:49.189
This is a disaster. The pattern is
made, the cloth's been cut.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.856
- How about a phone number?
- No, he said he was traveling.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.990
How'd you tell him
when his suits were ready?

05:54.020 --> 05:56.398
He called me. He was always
in a hurry to get his suits.

05:56.423 --> 05:58.425
- He's a busy fellow.
- Busy doing what?

05:58.458 --> 06:00.734
I don't know. Mr. Dupont did not use

06:00.760 --> 06:02.603
his personal life for small talk.

06:02.629 --> 06:04.074
What did he talk about?

06:04.097 --> 06:06.407
Business, politics, stock market.

06:06.433 --> 06:09.607
He used to tell me I should invest,
as if I had that kind of money.

06:09.636 --> 06:11.377
So he just walks in off the street

06:11.404 --> 06:13.213
and orders a bunch of $5,000 suits?

06:13.240 --> 06:15.777
He was referred to us by a very good customer.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.846
Jonathan Phelps.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.119
I kept running into him at dinner parties.

06:20.146 --> 06:21.454
He was great fun.

06:21.481 --> 06:23.586
It's a tragic loss for the family, I'm sure.

06:23.617 --> 06:26.359
First John Dupont killing
the wrestler, now this.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.229
Denis was one of those Duponts?

06:28.255 --> 06:30.792
Yes, by his father. His mother was French.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.599
He was raised there.

06:32.626 --> 06:35.072
So what's the inside story?

06:35.095 --> 06:37.735
We think he was meeting
somebody at The Newbury.

06:37.764 --> 06:39.266
Any candidates?

06:39.299 --> 06:42.542
I wouldn't know. I'd been out of touch
with Denis since last summer.

06:42.569 --> 06:45.675
I thought Denis could talk his way
out of any tight spot.

06:45.705 --> 06:47.548
He had talent for that sort of thing?

06:47.574 --> 06:49.952
Oh, speeding tickets, social blunders.

06:49.976 --> 06:52.286
Denis can charm his way
in or out of anything.

06:52.312 --> 06:54.155
And the last time you saw him?

06:54.180 --> 06:55.989
A few weeks ago.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.121
I ran into him at La Goulue.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.028
He was hanging out with a new crowd.

07:00.053 --> 07:03.296
Roy Markham, the investment banker,
and his wife Sydney.

07:03.323 --> 07:06.668
Denis and I threatened
to call each other, but we never did.

07:10.196 --> 07:11.937
Dead?

07:12.933 --> 07:15.641
We had no idea. We just came in from Bedford.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.876
I don't know what we can tell you.

07:17.904 --> 07:20.350
He was really just an acquaintance.

07:20.373 --> 07:22.819
Well, the people at the restaurant said

07:22.842 --> 07:24.947
you ate there together a number of times.

07:24.978 --> 07:28.187
As part of a group. Denis was a
good extra man to have around.

07:29.215 --> 07:33.493
- This is awful news.
- We’re having a hard time pinning
down where he lived.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.558
- Somewhere around the Park.
Isn't that right, Sydney?
- Mm-hmm.

07:36.589 --> 07:39.661
If you leave me your card, I’ll ask around.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.572
We'll do everything to help.

07:43.596 --> 07:47.009
- Louisa?
- We'll be expecting your call.

07:55.008 --> 07:57.215
I thought you said no one would get hurt.

07:57.243 --> 07:59.245
- Will you shut up?
- (door closes )

08:03.550 --> 08:06.087
Far as anybody knows, this
guy lived in the ether.

08:06.119 --> 08:08.895
You'd think the Dupont family'd
keep track of their heirs.

08:08.922 --> 08:11.562
We got calls into them,
the French Consulate, Interpol...

08:11.591 --> 08:13.696
Good. You found a fingernail at the scene?

08:13.727 --> 08:15.570
The nail polish was fresh.

08:15.595 --> 08:19.270
Forensics matched it to a polish
sold only at very exclusive salons.

08:19.299 --> 08:21.210
Only a few hundred of those in the city.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.838
(phone rings)

08:22.869 --> 08:24.906
Major Case Squad, Detective Eames speaking.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.645
Yes, thank you for returning my call.

08:26.673 --> 08:30.644
Question came up at a briefing--
if Dupont was using.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.623
There was only champagne found in the room.

08:32.645 --> 08:36.092
That was the French Consulate. Dupont
was a guest at a reception last month.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.153
They mailed the invitation to his home.

08:41.488 --> 08:43.297
It's a sublet.

08:43.323 --> 08:44.927
The owners live across town--

08:44.958 --> 08:47.370
the Blackstones.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.340
Maybe you should talk to them

08:49.362 --> 08:51.899
before you start going
through Mr. Dupont's things.

08:51.931 --> 08:53.501
Was he a friend of theirs?

08:53.533 --> 08:55.843
Mrs. Blackstone told me

08:55.869 --> 08:58.782
that he was a close personal friend of hers.

08:58.805 --> 09:02.116
Did Mr. Blackstone know
that Mr. Dupont was living here?

09:02.142 --> 09:03.678
Can't see that he couldn't.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.657
Dupont have many visitors? Lady friends?

09:06.679 --> 09:07.987
No, no.

09:08.014 --> 09:10.494
He was minding his P’s and Q's.

09:10.517 --> 09:12.360
The residents here

09:12.385 --> 09:15.298
are thin-skinned about any kind
of bad behavior.

09:15.321 --> 09:18.666
He was already on notice
for smoking in the elevator.

09:18.691 --> 09:20.568
The French, you know.

09:20.593 --> 09:22.971
We'll need the Blackstones' address.

09:22.996 --> 09:26.637
There's something so chilling
about picking up the paper

09:26.666 --> 09:30.079
and reading about an
old lover being murdered.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.982
(sighs)

09:33.206 --> 09:36.119
When did you stop seeing Mr. Dupont?

09:36.142 --> 09:37.348
Months ago.

09:37.377 --> 09:40.119
And we only slept together once.

09:40.146 --> 09:42.558
The French are highly overrated.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.687
He lived in your apartment.

09:44.717 --> 09:47.163
He needed a place to stay
while he was house hunting.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.497
What about your husband?

09:49.522 --> 09:51.001
He didn't mind.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.163
He travels a lot, he's rarely in town,

09:53.193 --> 09:56.333
the dog show, funerals, the US Open.

09:56.362 --> 09:58.205
Yes, I see he likes tennis.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.801
But that's not what I meant.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.972
Did your husband have a
relationship with him?

10:02.001 --> 10:04.982
Denis wasn't a switch-hitter,

10:05.004 --> 10:07.951
and if he were, he wouldn't've
been my husband's type.

10:07.974 --> 10:09.851
Mind if I ask how you...?

10:09.876 --> 10:12.550
The photos-- your husband
and his male tennis friends.

10:12.579 --> 10:14.525
You and your horses.

10:14.547 --> 10:17.050
No photos together. No children.

10:17.083 --> 10:19.120
Separate but equal lives.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.860
Very good.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.427
Well, if you want to know
who Denis was sleeping with

10:25.458 --> 10:27.028
why don't you ask Felix?

10:27.060 --> 10:28.937
Who's Felix?

10:28.962 --> 10:31.408
Felix Perez was Denis' gofer.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.274
Do you have an address for him?

10:33.299 --> 10:35.905
Heavens, no. Why would I?

10:38.471 --> 10:40.508
The blows were methodical,

10:40.540 --> 10:43.544
intended to inflict the most pain--
kidneys, ribs, groin.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.954
The variation and color
of the bruises indicates

10:45.979 --> 10:48.585
the victim was worked over for an hour or so.

10:48.615 --> 10:50.925
- The work of a professional.
- Yeah, I'd say so.

10:50.950 --> 10:54.659
- Internal injuries?
- Ruptured spleen, broken ribs,
punctured lungs.

10:54.687 --> 10:58.225
Somebody wanted something
from Dupont-- information.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.966
You can't talk very clearly
with your face looking like that.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.031
The damage to the face was postmortem.

11:03.062 --> 11:04.973
Cause of death was asphyxiation.

11:04.998 --> 11:08.138
So somebody tortured him
for an hour, suffocated him,

11:08.168 --> 11:11.308
and then for the hell of it
beat his face into hamburger?

11:11.337 --> 11:13.578
I guess they didn't get what they were after.

11:17.043 --> 11:21.185
Charity balls, gallery openings,
nightclub passes,

11:21.214 --> 11:23.251
receipts for Daniel, Le Cirque--

11:23.283 --> 11:25.422
this guy was living a high-octane existence.

11:25.451 --> 11:27.089
I'm heading upstairs for a Compstat.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.862
Any breaking news on Dupont
to liven up my presentation?

11:29.889 --> 11:32.563
Uh, sure. The DMV shows an address

11:32.592 --> 11:35.129
on his assistant, Felix Perez.

11:35.161 --> 11:36.697
Progress.

11:36.729 --> 11:38.834
The building was torn down last year,

11:38.865 --> 11:41.846
- Felix didn't leave a forwarding address.
- Thank you.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.314
- What's all this?
- Dupont's personal effects.

11:44.337 --> 11:47.443
Maybe whatever the bad guys were looking
for will show up in his papers.

11:47.473 --> 11:49.646
Anything does, page me.

11:50.677 --> 11:53.123
Here's George W.'s number in Texas.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.592
Really? I have a letter here
from Donald Trump

11:55.615 --> 11:58.459
thanking Dupont for his timely advice...

11:58.484 --> 12:00.862
And he misspells the word "investment."

12:00.887 --> 12:04.027
You'd think Trump's secretary
would use spell check.

12:06.693 --> 12:08.434
Here we go.

12:08.461 --> 12:11.408
Washington Livery, Felix Perez.

12:12.999 --> 12:15.172
Yeah, okay, maybe he did work here.

12:15.201 --> 12:18.307
But that doesn't mean I had anything
to do with anything he was doing.

12:18.338 --> 12:21.410
- Like what was he doing?
- What I heard from the other drivers--

12:21.441 --> 12:24.081
he'd pick up these Asian
businessmen at the airport,

12:24.110 --> 12:25.646
offer to get them hookers,

12:25.678 --> 12:27.487
take a couple of hundred off them...

12:27.513 --> 12:29.618
And then disappear. That and other things.

12:29.649 --> 12:32.323
- So you fired him?
- No. He got a better offer.

12:32.352 --> 12:35.629
- From?
- Customer he picked up at JFK last summer.

12:35.655 --> 12:37.157
A rich guy.

12:37.190 --> 12:40.603
Perez said he was going to be
this guy's personal assistant.

12:40.627 --> 12:42.629
Good luck to the both of them.

12:45.465 --> 12:49.311
The landlady says Felix has been
MIA since the murder.

12:49.335 --> 12:52.145
Look at this-- signatures. Donald Trump,

12:52.171 --> 12:54.583
Rupert Murdoch, Prince Ernst of Hanover.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.587
Perez was practicing forging.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.215
And here, letters of reference

12:59.245 --> 13:01.054
for Denis Dupont, unsigned.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.219
Now why would the heir to the Dupont fortune

13:03.249 --> 13:05.388
need phony character references?

13:05.418 --> 13:06.988
Low self-esteem?

13:07.020 --> 13:09.864
Well, we can always ask the Duponts.

13:09.889 --> 13:12.233
I'm sorry I was tardy in responding

13:12.258 --> 13:14.636
to your inquiry about Denis Dupont.

13:14.661 --> 13:16.436
All the newspapers were calling

13:16.462 --> 13:19.306
and I had no information
to give them, naturally.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.367
Why naturally?

13:20.400 --> 13:22.778
I did an in-depth search

13:22.802 --> 13:25.510
of the family records regarding Denis Dupont,

13:25.538 --> 13:27.779
this time concentrating

13:27.807 --> 13:30.185
on the French side of the family.

13:30.209 --> 13:32.849
Dupont's a very common name in France,

13:32.879 --> 13:34.324
but he's not one of ours.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.349
There's no connection to the family.

13:36.382 --> 13:39.022
You said this time -- you
made another search?

13:39.052 --> 13:41.396
- Mm-hmm, a few weeks ago.
- For whom?

13:41.421 --> 13:45.494
A Mr. Bernard Cove.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.402
Said he was in real estate.

13:49.128 --> 13:51.836
Dupont kept hawking me to invest with him,

13:51.864 --> 13:54.140
so I checked him out.

13:54.167 --> 13:58.673
When the Duponts said they'd
never heard of him, well,

13:58.705 --> 14:01.276
I decided to keep my money where it was.

14:01.307 --> 14:05.346
We should've known. His
manners, his name-dropping,

14:05.378 --> 14:08.018
He just didn't feel like old money.

14:08.047 --> 14:10.653
Did he find other investors?

14:13.119 --> 14:14.996
I don't know.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.501
Where'd you meet him?

14:18.791 --> 14:21.237
- A gallery opening, right?
- Mmm. Mm-hmm.

14:21.260 --> 14:23.797
Somebody introduced us, I don't remember who.

14:23.830 --> 14:26.777
We heard that women found him attractive.

14:26.799 --> 14:29.109
Did you find him attractive, Mrs. Cove?

14:31.371 --> 14:33.373
I suppose.

14:36.642 --> 14:39.555
What was it about him, specifically?

14:39.579 --> 14:43.220
Being a man, I'm curious.
I couldn't tell from his photo.

14:44.784 --> 14:47.697
Was it his mouth, his eyes?

14:49.655 --> 14:51.760
You'll have to excuse me.

15:01.634 --> 15:04.638
Dupont's finances track like a game
of Snakes and Ladders.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.843
Wire transfers to five different accounts,

15:06.873 --> 15:08.580
withdrawals by cashier's checks.

15:08.608 --> 15:11.111
And all the money's missing.
Over two million bucks.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.919
Missing? You mean out of the country?

15:12.945 --> 15:15.755
I checked the feds for
notifications of foreign transfers--

15:15.782 --> 15:18.524
nothing. The money's here somewhere.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.224
Well, where does the money come from?

15:20.253 --> 15:22.756
He had some kind of investment club.

15:22.789 --> 15:26.032
Heavy hitters at 300 grand a piece.

15:26.058 --> 15:29.403
Roy Markham, Mindy Blackstone, George Reid

15:29.429 --> 15:31.409
and guess who?

15:31.431 --> 15:34.605
Bernard Cove said he never
invested with Dupont,

15:34.634 --> 15:37.911
but here's a cashier's check
receipt for 250K from his account

15:37.937 --> 15:41.817
payable to Dupont, four weeks before
he called the Dupont family office.

15:41.841 --> 15:44.549
He found out Dupont was a phony
after he gave him the money--

15:44.577 --> 15:46.079
which isn't what he told us.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.456
So we don't like Perez?
He's low-rent, he's missing?

15:48.481 --> 15:50.688
Or now that his boss is dead
he's running scared.

15:50.716 --> 15:53.060
You think Cove knew Dupont
was shtupping his missus?

15:53.085 --> 15:54.257
Might've.

15:54.287 --> 15:57.029
Might've used the affair to set up Dupont.

15:57.056 --> 15:59.195
If a guy was picking my wallet and my bed,

15:59.225 --> 16:02.502
I'd want him whacked, too.
How do you want to proceed?

16:02.528 --> 16:04.701
A search warrant? What are you looking for?

16:04.730 --> 16:06.505
A fur coat. Russian sable.

16:06.532 --> 16:08.409
You could save yourself a lot of trouble

16:08.434 --> 16:10.209
if you just show us where you keep it.

16:10.236 --> 16:12.580
My husband just left for his office.
He'd prefer--

16:12.605 --> 16:14.881
- You mind turning this way?
- What're you doing?

16:14.907 --> 16:18.184
- We need a photo to show the staff at
The Newbury Hotel.
- Why? What for?

16:18.211 --> 16:21.055
The warrant is also valid
for nail polish products,

16:21.080 --> 16:24.721
or any records of visits to nail salons.

16:24.750 --> 16:28.288
Someone left a broken nail
in Denis Dupont's room.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.428
Oh my God.

16:35.661 --> 16:38.073
I could use a drink.

16:38.097 --> 16:40.077
You want to tell us something?

16:45.905 --> 16:47.942
I didn't kill him.

16:47.974 --> 16:50.318
He was already dead when I got to the room.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.152
There was nothing that I could do.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.556
Did your husband know
you were meeting him there?

16:54.580 --> 16:57.026
My husband? No, absolutely not. Why?

16:57.049 --> 16:59.791
We suspect he was setting a trap for Dupont.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.924
No, not over an affair.

17:01.954 --> 17:04.525
Besides, he did not know about Denis and me.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.662
Who knew you were going to the hotel?

17:06.692 --> 17:10.640
Nobody. Just Sydney.

17:10.663 --> 17:13.405
Sydney Markham is a friend of yours?

17:13.432 --> 17:15.969
Yes, a very good friend.

17:16.002 --> 17:19.142
She introduced Denis to me.

17:19.171 --> 17:21.981
Sydney Markham...

17:22.008 --> 17:26.012
Whose husband gave Dupont $325,000?

17:28.481 --> 17:30.961
Oh, I had no idea they'd invested.

17:30.983 --> 17:32.985
She never said a word.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.658
Oh my God.

17:36.689 --> 17:39.260
Oh my God. How could I have been so stupid?

17:41.160 --> 17:43.197
It must have been all of them.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.943
They were all in on it.

17:52.371 --> 17:54.442
They came to my house, two of them.

17:54.473 --> 17:56.350
They're not going to find out anything.

17:56.375 --> 17:59.515
How can you be so sure,
hmm? They got this far.

17:59.545 --> 18:01.422
There's no point arguing among ourselves.

18:01.447 --> 18:03.825
We just pay this guy off
and get it over with.

18:03.849 --> 18:06.159
We paid him to get our money back,
which he didn't do.

18:06.185 --> 18:08.722
Now we're going to pay him more
'cause he botched the job?

18:08.754 --> 18:13.260
- We want him to leave town, period.
- Don't you people get it?

18:13.292 --> 18:15.203
We killed a man.

18:15.227 --> 18:17.730
We might not have meant it to happen

18:17.763 --> 18:19.106
but we are responsible.

18:19.131 --> 18:22.374
Okay, we're responsible.

18:22.401 --> 18:25.348
This is what the son of a
bitch is asking for.

18:25.371 --> 18:27.977
I divided it four ways.

18:31.477 --> 18:33.479
Good God!

18:35.014 --> 18:38.359
We pay this and we never
have to worry about it again.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.394
You hope.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.435
A murder conspiracy?

18:49.462 --> 18:51.373
By some of our more prominent citizens.

18:51.397 --> 18:53.399
I'm as shocked as you are.

18:53.432 --> 18:56.572
If Dupont was ripping them off
then why not go to the police?

18:57.336 --> 19:00.146
Embarrassment? Savvy businessmen taken in

19:00.172 --> 19:02.618
by impostor with continental accent?

19:02.642 --> 19:05.316
Ooh! There'd be cautionary
tales in The Journal.

19:05.344 --> 19:07.153
Their credibility would be shot.

19:07.179 --> 19:08.681
I don't see the evidence.

19:08.714 --> 19:10.625
Can you substantiate Mrs. Caves story?

19:10.650 --> 19:14.063
Dupont got a call at his hotel
room at 2:00 from a woman.

19:14.086 --> 19:17.465
Karen Cove said it wasn't her.
She said Sydney Markham delayed her.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.266
Sydney Markham might've been
the one who called Dupont

19:20.292 --> 19:22.602
to make sure he was in place for his beating.

19:22.628 --> 19:25.006
They want to subpoena her phone records.

19:25.031 --> 19:27.136
I'll make it happen.

19:28.134 --> 19:30.842
No, I did not call Dupont at his hotel.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.214
I didn't even know he was at a hotel.

19:33.239 --> 19:35.981
Your phone records show
the call came from here.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.885
Well, I don't know how that's possible.

19:37.910 --> 19:41.187
I do. You're not going
to like my explanation.

19:41.213 --> 19:43.853
Sydney, your driver is downstairs.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.489
Oh, tell Sammy I'll be 20 minutes.

19:48.888 --> 19:52.097
You're forcing me to betray a confidence.

19:52.124 --> 19:54.468
Karen Cove was here that afternoon,

19:54.493 --> 19:56.905
and I believe she was having
an affair with Dupont.

19:56.929 --> 20:00.604
Now if there was a phone call,
it must've come from her.

20:02.234 --> 20:05.010
She already told us about the affair.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.574
She denied making the call.

20:12.511 --> 20:15.219
I don't like to say this about a friend,

20:15.247 --> 20:17.818
but Karen is lying.

20:17.850 --> 20:20.888
She called him. I overheard her.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.275
Give me your license and registration.

20:41.307 --> 20:43.378
What's the problem, Officer?

20:43.409 --> 20:46.322
Uh, well, you're parked
too close to the hydrant.

20:46.345 --> 20:48.416
I thought the rule was 15 feet?

20:48.447 --> 20:50.984
You look about 14 feet to me.

20:54.553 --> 20:58.729
Okay, Sammy. Here you go.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.533
Besides driving Mrs. Markham,

21:00.559 --> 21:03.699
Samuel Bell's been arrested for
bookmaking and a couple of dope pops.

21:03.729 --> 21:06.005
In the bookmaking, who were his associates?

21:07.800 --> 21:11.077
Two. Tommy Doonan -- looks
like he was the bank--

21:11.103 --> 21:13.140
and Leslie Roche--

21:13.172 --> 21:15.618
convictions for assault, assault, assault.

21:15.641 --> 21:18.520
- A collector.
- He's still on probation.

21:18.544 --> 21:20.820
Couple of phone numbers.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.919
Let's track him down. Here.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.860
Hi, is Les there?

21:25.885 --> 21:27.922
It's Sandy.

21:27.953 --> 21:31.958
Well, I owe him some money,
and you know how he is.

21:31.991 --> 21:34.301
( laughs ) Florida?

21:34.326 --> 21:36.533
Oh shoot, I'd so love to talk to him.

21:36.562 --> 21:38.599
You think you got his number down there?

21:41.534 --> 21:44.105
Thanks a bunch. Bye.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.810
Boca Raton. Sport fishing.

21:46.839 --> 21:49.319
What do you know? A parole violation.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.655
I don't do things like this.

21:55.681 --> 21:58.457
I'm a professional.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.623
No muss, no fuss, no murder.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.758
You can check my rap sheet.

22:02.788 --> 22:05.701
We looked in that doctor's bag of tricks

22:05.724 --> 22:08.068
the Boca Raton police got off you.

22:08.093 --> 22:11.666
Slap jacks, brass knuckles--

22:11.697 --> 22:13.540
all of which are illegal, by the way.

22:13.566 --> 22:17.537
My client collects those
for entertainment purposes only.

22:17.570 --> 22:19.550
He'd never actually hit anybody with them.

22:19.572 --> 22:22.553
Then Mr. Dupont must have bumped
into your client's brass knuckles

22:22.575 --> 22:25.249
because they match the bruises on his body.

22:25.277 --> 22:27.723
We're all grown-ups here.

22:27.746 --> 22:29.783
You have one chance

22:29.815 --> 22:32.694
to take your chestnuts out of the fire

22:32.718 --> 22:35.096
and tell us who hired you,

22:35.120 --> 22:37.862
or go down for this all by yourself.

22:48.567 --> 22:51.844
Roy Markham got my name from his driver.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.408
He told me some guy ripped off
him and his friends.

22:54.440 --> 22:57.546
Markham told me to go to this hotel
room, the guy would be there.

22:57.576 --> 22:59.180
They sent me to reason with him.

22:59.211 --> 23:02.784
But the guy head-butts me, makes for
the door, so I gotta knock him down.

23:02.815 --> 23:05.489
It took me a little while to get
control of the situation

23:05.517 --> 23:07.724
but when I did, I asked him
where the money was,

23:07.753 --> 23:10.131
he kept saying he didn't know.

23:10.155 --> 23:12.362
About a half hour later he passed out.

23:12.391 --> 23:15.235
It was time to quit. I left.

23:15.261 --> 23:18.640
He was still breathing. I did not kill him,

23:18.664 --> 23:22.544
I did not break an ashtray on his face.

23:23.569 --> 23:27.608
You said it took a while for you
to get things under control.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.347
This guy was fighting you?

23:29.375 --> 23:30.820
Oh, yeah. From the get-go.

23:30.843 --> 23:33.187
You know, I think he liked to fight.

23:33.212 --> 23:35.419
Might've had a little training.

23:36.348 --> 23:39.761
- Is this the guy you beat up?
- No.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.959
Yeah, that's the guy.

23:49.094 --> 23:51.574
Felix Perez.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.008
Who's Perez?

23:53.999 --> 23:57.537
That's the guy you beat up. The wrong guy.

24:01.740 --> 24:05.210
Somebody tipped Dupont off,
so he put Perez in the room

24:05.244 --> 24:06.985
to get the beating meant for him.

24:07.012 --> 24:09.492
He came back after Leslie Roche left,

24:09.515 --> 24:11.290
finished off Perez, disfigured him

24:11.317 --> 24:13.524
and left him unidentifiable.

24:13.552 --> 24:15.429
Do we even know Dupont's real identity?

24:15.454 --> 24:18.333
We sent the prints from his apartment
to France. No hits yet.

24:18.357 --> 24:20.268
So now he's free to disappear.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.602
While the people he conned
take the rap for his murder.

24:25.164 --> 24:28.475
Uh, there's a chance he's still around.

24:28.500 --> 24:31.970
He's flamboyant and narcissistic.

24:32.004 --> 24:34.780
He's going to want to be where
he can witness his handiwork.

24:34.807 --> 24:38.118
Oh, and he still has two million
bucks stashed somewhere.

24:38.143 --> 24:40.919
So then it's just a question
of flushing him out.

24:40.946 --> 24:43.756
The moment that he has
an inkling that we're on to him,

24:43.782 --> 24:45.318
he's gone.

24:45.351 --> 24:47.888
We need to maintain
his sense of security.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.924
So what are you suggesting?

24:50.956 --> 24:53.334
Charge Markham and his friends
with Dupont's murder.

24:55.227 --> 24:57.605
Charge them for a murder they didn't commit

24:57.629 --> 25:00.303
of a person who isn't dead?

25:00.332 --> 25:03.506
I can't begin to count the number
of violations that would entail.

25:03.535 --> 25:07.312
Mr. Carver, this man Dupont,
or whatever his name is,

25:07.339 --> 25:09.979
has had us chasing our tails
for the last couple of weeks.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.922
I don't know about you,
but I do not like being made a fool of

25:17.616 --> 25:20.859
Payback is the healthy human response here.

25:24.723 --> 25:26.964
Well, I suppose Mr. Roche could be lying

25:26.992 --> 25:28.938
and he did kill the man at the hotel room.

25:29.561 --> 25:33.805
And since the identity of the deceased
is still a matter of conjecture,

25:33.832 --> 25:36.210
it's entirely proper that we charge them

25:36.235 --> 25:39.341
with the murder of John Doe,
AKA, Denis Dupont.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.647
Meantime, we give this to the papers.

25:41.673 --> 25:44.916
The bigger the headlines the better.
We want Dupont to take the hook.

25:46.412 --> 25:49.325
The people charged in the
murder of Denis Dupont

25:49.348 --> 25:51.385
include financier; Ron Markham;

25:51.417 --> 25:53.454
his wife, hat designer; Sydney Markham;

25:53.485 --> 25:56.227
real estate developer,
Bernard Cove and his wife...

25:56.255 --> 25:59.759
Didier, why are you hiding here?

25:59.792 --> 26:01.965
I always hated that picture-

26:03.462 --> 26:05.408
It doesn't even look like you.

26:05.431 --> 26:08.878
Come on now, I have someone
I want you to meet.

26:12.604 --> 26:14.914
Quentin,

26:14.940 --> 26:17.477
this is my boyfriend, Didier.

26:17.509 --> 26:19.955
He's opening the nightclub
I was telling you about.

26:19.978 --> 26:22.720
Simone, you had girl,
I told you not to talk about it.

26:22.748 --> 26:25.160
I only did it because Quentin is so nice.

26:25.184 --> 26:27.164
He's looking for a place to...

26:27.186 --> 26:29.257
How do you say it? "Park your money"?

26:29.288 --> 26:31.859
- Yes.
- I have to be honest with you,

26:31.890 --> 26:34.370
I'm not really looking for investors.

26:34.393 --> 26:35.804
May I ask...

26:35.828 --> 26:38.001
Did you get this suit at Savile Row?

26:38.030 --> 26:40.806
Well, yes. I was just in
London for some meetings.

26:40.833 --> 26:43.211
I get very intrigued

26:43.235 --> 26:46.114
by a man who doesn't want my money.

26:46.138 --> 26:49.381
So, tell me about your club, huh?

26:53.112 --> 26:55.991
- Not guilty.
- Not guilty.

26:56.014 --> 26:58.517
- Not guilty.
- Not guilty.

26:58.550 --> 26:59.790
Not guilty.

26:59.818 --> 27:01.388
People on bail?

27:01.420 --> 27:03.058
A million dollars each, Your Honor.

27:03.088 --> 27:06.535
Such high bail, Your Honor, when the
charges are patently ridiculous.

27:06.558 --> 27:08.731
There's no motive for any murder.

27:08.760 --> 27:12.367
The monies my clients
paid Mr. Dupont were venture capital,

27:12.397 --> 27:14.001
with no expectation of repayment.

27:14.032 --> 27:17.844
Your Honor, they make $2 million gifts
to perfect strangers

27:17.870 --> 27:19.747
and here they are squawking about bail.

27:19.771 --> 27:22.911
Your protestations do
sound hollow, Mr. Bascomb.

27:22.941 --> 27:26.047
Bail is set at a million
for each defendant. Next!

27:26.078 --> 27:30.026
Docket number 3922, People v. Nanette Cohn.

27:30.048 --> 27:32.085
Charge is two counts of larceny...

27:32.117 --> 27:34.961
My client, Mrs. Markham, wants to talk.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.694
An right.

27:36.822 --> 27:38.768
I warned Denis.

27:38.790 --> 27:41.100
My husband put this scheme in motion

27:41.126 --> 27:44.596
to get our money back,
but I couldn't go through with it.

27:44.630 --> 27:47.941
So I called him... from my showroom.

27:47.966 --> 27:51.004
I told him that they were sending
a man over to his hotel.

27:51.036 --> 27:52.811
I told him he should leave.

27:53.805 --> 27:55.580
I don't understand why he didn't.

27:56.808 --> 27:59.379
Since she renunciated the plan,

27:59.411 --> 28:01.391
she's off the hook for the murder.

28:01.413 --> 28:03.324
I'll consider it.

28:03.348 --> 28:06.795
Mrs. Markham, were you
and Mr. Dupont lovers?

28:09.188 --> 28:11.031
Briefly.

28:11.056 --> 28:13.058
And you knew he wasn't who he claimed to be?

28:13.091 --> 28:16.903
Yes, before my husband or any of the others.

28:16.929 --> 28:19.239
- But you didn't care?
- No.

28:20.332 --> 28:24.974
To see someone like him trick
my husband and his friends...

28:25.003 --> 28:27.040
Someone like him, what do you mean?

28:28.173 --> 28:30.380
He was raised in an orphanage.

28:30.409 --> 28:33.322
My father owned a grocery store.

28:33.345 --> 28:35.723
I know what it's like to climb up.

28:35.747 --> 28:38.159
We were very good friends.

28:38.183 --> 28:40.857
Well, how'd he show it?

28:40.886 --> 28:43.230
Like my hat business.

28:43.255 --> 28:45.667
Roy called it a money drain, a hobby.

28:45.691 --> 28:48.365
But Denis made me take it seriously.

28:49.428 --> 28:52.034
He helped me develop a business plan.

28:52.064 --> 28:54.203
He organized my books.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.008
Organized your books?

28:56.034 --> 28:59.413
Yes. He believed in me.

29:00.772 --> 29:03.446
Mrs. Markham brought him in
a couple of months ago

29:03.475 --> 29:05.648
like he was some kind of business god.

29:05.677 --> 29:08.351
He didn't know a line sheet
from an order form.

29:08.380 --> 29:11.691
Did he ask about any banking information--

29:11.717 --> 29:14.095
routing numbers, that sort of thing?

29:14.119 --> 29:16.963
No. But he asked for the
Articles of Incorporation

29:16.989 --> 29:18.900
and the corporate seal.

29:18.924 --> 29:20.835
Did he say why?

29:20.859 --> 29:23.135
No. I know he kept them overnight.

29:23.161 --> 29:25.107
I don't know what for.

29:25.130 --> 29:27.337
To open a bank account, for one thing.

29:27.366 --> 29:30.575
This letter from the IRS,
you know anything about it?

29:30.602 --> 29:33.105
- It's a tax lien.
- Tax lien?

29:33.138 --> 29:36.244
It's dated three weeks ago.

29:38.677 --> 29:40.486
Mode O'Day Hats,

29:40.512 --> 29:43.425
$65,000 in unpaid payroll taxes.

29:43.448 --> 29:46.520
With penalties and interest,
it comes to $90,000.

29:46.551 --> 29:49.828
Your letter said that you already seized
that money from the bank account.

29:49.855 --> 29:52.597
But the bank said that they
have no record of seizure.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.467
Well, they should. Nissei Bank--

29:54.493 --> 29:56.598
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not their bank.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.630
Well, we found an account
there under their name.

29:58.664 --> 30:00.143
It opened two months ago.

30:00.165 --> 30:03.635
- How much in the account?
- As of two weeks ago,

30:03.669 --> 30:06.411
$1,865,000.

30:06.438 --> 30:08.748
The account's frozen until we
get a notarized release

30:08.774 --> 30:11.220
stating they accept our findings
of a tax delinquency.

30:11.243 --> 30:12.813
A notarized release signed by whom?

30:12.844 --> 30:16.917
Mode O'Day's sole shareholder--
Mr. Sydney Markham.

30:16.948 --> 30:19.485
Once we get it, it takes a couple
of weeks to process.

30:19.518 --> 30:22.294
Until then, the account's frozen
like winter in Siberia.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.392
I explained all of this to Mr. Markham.

30:24.423 --> 30:27.165
- You spoke to him?
- Yes, twice.

30:27.192 --> 30:30.071
He even came in, he was so
insistent to clear up the problem.

30:30.095 --> 30:32.541
If only they were all like that.

30:34.199 --> 30:35.906
Is this Mr. Markham?

30:35.934 --> 30:37.914
Yes.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.879
He thought he had the
perfect place to hide his money,

30:45.911 --> 30:48.187
but he didn't count on
the Internal Revenue Service.

30:48.213 --> 30:50.090
Neither did AI Capone.

30:50.115 --> 30:53.153
We still have some time. He has to
phony up some ID for the notary,

30:53.185 --> 30:55.529
and then there's the
turnaround time for the IRS.

30:55.554 --> 30:58.899
Two weeks. If we haven't found him by
then, we're not letting that money go.

30:58.924 --> 31:00.699
We can stall for a few days,

31:00.726 --> 31:03.138
but the minute he picks up
our scent, he'll scoot.

31:03.161 --> 31:05.141
You've got your work cut out.

31:05.163 --> 31:06.665
What's the plan?

31:06.698 --> 31:09.702
- Engage his ego.
- Ah.

31:09.735 --> 31:13.342
He was a confidence man
with too much confidence.

31:13.372 --> 31:16.182
He overestimated his own charisma

31:16.208 --> 31:19.314
and died a fool.

31:21.480 --> 31:24.893
- Is that good for you, Tom?
- Perfect. Thanks, Bobby.

31:26.618 --> 31:28.655
Isn't that Santini from the "Ledger"?

31:28.687 --> 31:32.032
- Yeah. Don't worry, I mentioned your name.
- ( laughs )

31:37.429 --> 31:39.340
I'm going jogging.

31:40.932 --> 31:43.037
What's wrong?

31:47.472 --> 31:50.078
What do you care what they think? It's done.

31:50.108 --> 31:51.883
You get that stupid paper signed,

31:51.910 --> 31:55.084
you come back to Rio with me and
I'll make you forget these people.

31:55.113 --> 31:57.115
Where is your phone?

32:01.153 --> 32:03.133
Here.

32:03.155 --> 32:05.829
I'll get you some food on the way back, okay?

32:09.261 --> 32:13.073
Yes, I would like to place
an international call, person-to-person.

32:13.098 --> 32:17.808
The number is 212-555-0109.

32:17.836 --> 32:19.076
Yes, New York.

32:19.104 --> 32:21.846
Tom Santini.

32:21.873 --> 32:24.285
My name is Denis Dupont.

32:24.309 --> 32:26.516
He said he was very much alive.

32:26.545 --> 32:28.525
He wouldn't tell me where he was,

32:28.547 --> 32:31.153
but the operator said the call originated

32:31.183 --> 32:34.096
from a cell phone prefix from Rio De Janeiro.

32:34.119 --> 32:36.429
What else did he say?

32:36.455 --> 32:38.560
He didn't consider himself a criminal.

32:38.590 --> 32:40.627
He was on a holy mission

32:40.659 --> 32:42.661
to cure the rich of their greed.

32:42.694 --> 32:45.402
He was very funny about it.

32:45.430 --> 32:48.434
What's funny is we've had
half a dozen people call

32:48.467 --> 32:50.208
claiming to be Dennis Dupont.

32:50.235 --> 32:51.509
Really?

32:52.504 --> 32:54.780
This guy had a French accent.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.649
They all had French accents.

32:56.675 --> 32:58.655
(laughing)

32:58.677 --> 33:02.147
Quote me. "Detective Goren says

33:02.180 --> 33:04.626
that Dennis Dupont is dead."

33:04.649 --> 33:07.493
Done. It'll be in tomorrow's paper.

33:08.787 --> 33:11.529
(phone rings)

33:13.692 --> 33:15.194
Goren.

33:15.227 --> 33:18.367
Detective Goren,
pleasure to put a voice to the name.

33:18.396 --> 33:21.343
- Who's this?
- This is the man you call Dupont.

33:21.366 --> 33:24.006
You're going to have to do
better than that.

33:24.035 --> 33:25.514
I get a lot of crank calls.

33:25.537 --> 33:28.177
It's such a shame what
they did to my friend Felix.

33:28.206 --> 33:31.016
They killed him so brutally.

33:31.042 --> 33:32.988
And I'm sold, Mr. Dupont.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.218
Or-- or do you want to tell me
your real name?

33:35.247 --> 33:38.160
Dupont seems to open so many doors.

33:38.183 --> 33:39.685
Not this one.

33:39.718 --> 33:42.164
I’m going to hang up now,
whatever your name is.

33:42.187 --> 33:44.827
Wait, wait, wait. Why not?

33:44.856 --> 33:47.996
There is no intimacy without trust.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.472
My name is Didier--

33:50.495 --> 33:52.406
A common enough name.

33:52.430 --> 33:55.411
A common name for an uncommon beginning.

33:55.433 --> 33:57.379
You were an orphan, isn't that right?

33:58.904 --> 34:02.750
No, my parents were alive
but unable to care for me.

34:02.774 --> 34:04.378
It's a very different thing.

34:04.409 --> 34:07.219
If they were dead,
they'd have had a better excuse.

34:07.245 --> 34:09.452
Hey, what was it like being in an orphanage

34:09.481 --> 34:12.052
with all those kids nobody wanted?

34:12.083 --> 34:14.063
Must've been hard to be special.

34:14.085 --> 34:17.328
I was special. You don't know
what you're talking about.

34:18.322 --> 34:20.893
Maybe you're special now,

34:20.926 --> 34:23.338
but back then you were abandoned.

34:23.360 --> 34:27.103
You were a ward of the State
just like thousands of other poor kids.

34:27.132 --> 34:28.770
I was not poor.

34:28.800 --> 34:31.474
I was only in an orphanage a very short time.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.449
Didier, you don't have to be ashamed.

34:33.471 --> 34:36.418
I'm not ashamed. I can't believe
we're even talking about this.

34:36.440 --> 34:40.355
Well, we can talk about anything you like.

34:40.378 --> 34:43.552
Let's talk about...

34:43.581 --> 34:46.152
How far you've come,

34:47.152 --> 34:49.428
considering you were raised

34:49.454 --> 34:52.161
in some state orphanage with bad food,

34:52.190 --> 34:54.192
bad hygiene, abuse--

34:54.225 --> 34:55.761
was there a lot of abuse?

34:55.793 --> 34:57.933
I told you I was not raised there.

34:57.963 --> 35:01.911
The authorities in my canton
returned me to my parents.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.342
I'm sure your parents are impressed

35:05.370 --> 35:09.045
with everything that you've accomplished.

35:09.074 --> 35:11.076
Or maybe they don't care.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.453
This is intolerable. I don't
know how you people

35:13.478 --> 35:16.049
make a living out of sheer stupidity!

35:16.081 --> 35:19.062
You made a mistake about me, Mr. Goren.

35:19.084 --> 35:21.530
That's all I wanted to let you know.

35:26.858 --> 35:29.839
Do we have the fingerprints
for Mr. Dupont over there?

35:29.861 --> 35:31.807
What's up?

35:31.830 --> 35:34.071
I just got a call from our dead Frenchman.

35:34.099 --> 35:38.445
He said his "canton" gave
him back to his parents.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.074
Cantons are the equivalent of states.

35:40.105 --> 35:43.746
He's not French, he's Swiss.

35:43.775 --> 35:45.777
The Swiss police got a hit on the prints.

35:45.810 --> 35:49.053
Didier Foucault, 33, aliases up the wazoo.

35:49.080 --> 35:52.755
Convictions for fraud, check
kiting, no record of violence.

35:52.784 --> 35:55.458
Last stretch was 7 years ago--
he served 6 months.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.160
The Swiss faxed us

35:57.188 --> 35:59.691
everything they had on
Foucault's early years.

35:59.724 --> 36:02.068
Being Swiss, that probably
includes his dirty nappies.

36:02.093 --> 36:04.505
Contrary to what he told us,

36:04.529 --> 36:07.942
he was in an orphanage run by nuns
from age four to 15.

36:07.966 --> 36:10.310
He was never adopted.
His mother was a prostitute.

36:10.335 --> 36:12.815
He had medical problems
right through his childhood.

36:12.837 --> 36:14.714
That's good, but we still have to find him.

36:14.739 --> 36:17.310
Well, 10 to 1 he'll call back.

36:18.677 --> 36:21.283
He has something to prove to me now.

36:21.312 --> 36:23.258
10 to 1?

36:28.219 --> 36:30.927
I've taken him on before, Mr. Carver.

36:30.955 --> 36:33.435
I'm down 18 bucks.

36:33.458 --> 36:35.404
From Dr. Steven Pitt--

36:35.427 --> 36:39.000
"Orphans live with
a perpetual sense of shame.”

36:39.030 --> 36:40.941
“Some overcompensate through achievement,”

36:40.965 --> 36:44.208
“some mollify their pain
through substance abuse,”

36:44.235 --> 36:48.650
“and some invent complex fantasies
with over-idealized parents.”

36:48.673 --> 36:51.483
“Taken to an extreme,
these individuals develop”

36:51.509 --> 36:54.615
“into pseudologia fantastica-- impostors—“

36:54.646 --> 36:57.786
“who, when confronted
with evidence of their fraud”

36:57.816 --> 36:59.727
“erupt in a rage,”

36:59.751 --> 37:02.322
“and will go to any length
to persuade their audience”

37:02.353 --> 37:04.833
“that their fantasy is true."

37:07.192 --> 37:09.604
He'll call.

37:10.762 --> 37:15.040
He could be using an alias.
Leonard Rochefoucault...

37:15.066 --> 37:16.909
Goren, line four.

37:16.935 --> 37:19.279
I'll call you back.

37:22.240 --> 37:26.279
- Goren.
- Detective Goren, hello.

37:28.046 --> 37:31.152
I wanted to apologize for losing my temper

37:31.182 --> 37:33.162
during our last conversation.

37:33.184 --> 37:36.358
Hey, I understand. Your
childhood's a sore subject.

37:36.387 --> 37:37.923
I don't take it personally.

37:37.956 --> 37:40.402
I'm not the kind of person
who loses his temper.

37:40.425 --> 37:43.429
I was raised with good manners.

37:43.461 --> 37:45.941
You mean at the orphanage? Who raised you?

37:45.964 --> 37:48.240
Civil servants? Priests? Nuns?

37:50.001 --> 37:53.608
What did you do when you wanted
somebody to hold you,

37:54.939 --> 37:57.112
to comfort you?

37:57.142 --> 37:58.917
Hmm, Didier?

37:58.943 --> 38:01.583
Did you make yourself sick
and run to the nurse?

38:01.613 --> 38:03.524
What are you talking about?

38:03.548 --> 38:06.119
Kids like you, abandoned kids,

38:06.151 --> 38:07.994
are hypochondriacs.

38:08.019 --> 38:09.896
This is where you have it all wrong.

38:09.921 --> 38:12.299
My upbringing taught me how to survive.

38:12.323 --> 38:15.964
You survived by pretending
to be other people.

38:15.994 --> 38:18.065
I survived because I was superior.

38:18.096 --> 38:20.633
I am always three steps ahead.

38:20.665 --> 38:23.737
These people you conned, you
weren't three steps ahead of them.

38:23.768 --> 38:25.509
You got out by the skin of your teeth.

38:25.537 --> 38:27.813
- But I got out.
- Only by killing Felix Perez.

38:27.839 --> 38:30.285
- You screwed up, Didier.
- You think what you want.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.379
I think you’re living up to your breeding.

38:32.410 --> 38:36.381
I'll bet your parents
were crooks or drug addicts.

38:36.414 --> 38:38.826
I'll bet your dad pimped out your mom!

38:38.850 --> 38:40.989
You stupid cop!

38:41.019 --> 38:43.465
You have no idea! No idea!

38:43.488 --> 38:45.968
I have an idea you're
terrified of going to prison.

38:45.990 --> 38:48.095
It'd be like going back to the orphanage.

38:48.126 --> 38:51.198
Prison is nothing.

38:52.263 --> 38:54.937
Oh, of course. You've been to prison.

38:54.966 --> 38:57.674
Another mistake made by idiots like you.

38:57.702 --> 39:01.047
But I didn't care. It was a vacation.

39:01.072 --> 39:04.679
Do you know how long it took me
to get special privileges in prison?

39:04.709 --> 39:08.350
Less than 24 hours.

39:08.379 --> 39:10.950
What's a special privilege in a prison?

39:10.982 --> 39:12.928
A tick-infested pillow?

39:12.951 --> 39:16.922
Fresh fruit, caipirinhas,

39:16.955 --> 39:19.458
women-- anything I wanted.

39:19.490 --> 39:22.198
I had the guards like a...

39:22.227 --> 39:24.070
Palm in a fist.

39:24.095 --> 39:26.041
- Drugs?
- Drugs?

39:26.064 --> 39:28.305
See how you think?

39:28.333 --> 39:32.372
You see the pedestrian
level of your intellect?

39:32.403 --> 39:34.713
It's the trouble with you police--

39:34.739 --> 39:36.810
so many guns, so little brains.

39:36.841 --> 39:38.980
You think you'd make a good detective?

39:39.010 --> 39:41.012
I think I'd make the very best detective.

39:41.045 --> 39:42.285
Do you know why?

39:42.313 --> 39:45.886
I understand human nature.

39:47.252 --> 39:51.496
You might profit from such
a study, Detective Goren.

39:57.795 --> 40:00.207
Caipirinhas.

40:00.231 --> 40:02.939
He was in prison in Brazil.

40:02.967 --> 40:05.345
Two years ago, he served eight months

40:05.370 --> 40:07.316
for credit card fraud in Brazil.

40:07.338 --> 40:09.614
He was arrested at a Rio
airport with a girlfriend,

40:09.641 --> 40:11.587
Simone DaSilva, a Brazilian national.

40:11.609 --> 40:13.111
The cell phone from Rio.

40:13.144 --> 40:15.590
We figure he's here with her.
We're calling the hotels

40:15.613 --> 40:17.718
looking for a registration under her name.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.558
Our boy's been keeping himself busy.

40:19.584 --> 40:21.621
The IRS got the notarized release from him.

40:21.653 --> 40:23.360
We're pulling in the notary--

40:23.388 --> 40:26.528
We found the girl. SoHo East, room 1216.

40:26.557 --> 40:28.559
I'll handle the warrants.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.538
- (door opens)
- Is that you?

40:31.562 --> 40:33.132
I was just going down to the bar--

40:33.164 --> 40:36.668
Get your hands on the back of your head!
Sit down! Sit down!

40:36.701 --> 40:38.681
I got her.

40:56.187 --> 40:58.531
You have bitters and soda?

41:00.591 --> 41:03.265
I'm trying to quit drinking.

41:03.294 --> 41:06.366
Maybe Happy Hour isn't
the best place for you.

41:08.566 --> 41:10.477
Well, at least I can smoke.

41:13.905 --> 41:16.545
Nice to put a face to a voice.

41:18.776 --> 41:21.188
(gun cocks)

41:27.585 --> 41:29.531
You have the wrong man.

41:30.855 --> 41:33.199
I don't think so.

41:40.498 --> 41:43.172
- Bail is denied.
- ( gavel bangs )

41:43.201 --> 41:47.047
- Next case.
- People versus Didier Foucault,

41:47.071 --> 41:50.450
Murder in the second degree,
larceny in the first degree.

41:50.475 --> 41:52.148
How do you plead, Mr. Foucault?

41:52.176 --> 41:54.850
- Not guilty, sir.
- People on bail?

41:54.879 --> 41:57.086
We want him remanded to custody, Your Honor.

41:57.115 --> 42:01.586
Your Honor, my client's friends stand
ready to put up any bail amount to
insure his appearance.

42:01.619 --> 42:03.758
These so-called friends are his victims.

42:03.788 --> 42:05.734
He doesn't care about their money.

42:05.757 --> 42:08.135
He was arrested with a ticket for Brazil

42:08.159 --> 42:11.436
and passports bearing 3 different identities.

42:11.462 --> 42:14.033
Now if there was ever a flight risk, he's it.

42:14.065 --> 42:16.773
Thank you, Mr. Carver.

42:16.801 --> 42:18.246
Bail is denied.

42:18.269 --> 42:20.977
The defendant is remanded
to custody pending trial.

42:21.005 --> 42:23.042
- ( gavel bangs )
- Next case.

42:23.074 --> 42:25.281
Docket number 4604.

42:25.309 --> 42:29.052
People v. Christine Chen.
One count child abuse.

42:37.188 --> 42:39.828
Try telling them they're victims.

42:41.059 --> 42:43.869
Don't tell me you feel sorry for this guy?

42:43.895 --> 42:46.239
Nah.

42:46.264 --> 42:48.938
Someone to teach you how to ride a bike,

42:48.966 --> 42:52.277
two people that think you're special?
It makes a difference.

42:52.303 --> 42:54.840
Some people get by on a lot less.

42:54.872 --> 42:56.613
They shouldn't have to.

43:03.815 --> 43:05.726
