WEBVTT

00:10.880 --> 00:12.577
I need to be sure of you, Alfie.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.884
You've been
a little flighty recently.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.581
I need three seats
on next week's flight to Gotham.

00:16.712 --> 00:19.019
I hope America's worth
all this shite.

00:19.149 --> 00:21.499
The League have elected
a new prime minister.

00:21.630 --> 00:23.240
<i>Victor Aziz.</i>

00:23.371 --> 00:24.589
This new chap, Aziz,

00:24.720 --> 00:26.635
were he approached
confidentially,

00:26.765 --> 00:28.941
he might listen to reason.

00:29.072 --> 00:31.727
Do you speak for Harwood
and the Union or for yourself?

00:31.857 --> 00:33.033
I speak for the good
of the English people.

00:33.163 --> 00:35.861
Secret meetings
with the prime minister

00:35.992 --> 00:37.776
of the English League.

00:37.907 --> 00:39.430
I went to speak to him
on your behalf.

00:39.561 --> 00:40.692
Guards.

00:41.998 --> 00:43.565
I was trying to help you!

00:43.695 --> 00:44.609
Regarding Mrs. Gaunt--

00:44.740 --> 00:46.002
everyone I spoke to

00:46.133 --> 00:47.656
believes she's innocent
of the charges

00:47.786 --> 00:49.701
-against her.
-Do they?

00:56.404 --> 00:59.711
Take Lord Harwood away
and confine him to his quarters.

00:59.842 --> 01:00.799
I can explain.

01:03.150 --> 01:04.673
You haven't told him?

01:04.803 --> 01:05.891
Told him what?

01:06.022 --> 01:07.719
That you're pregnant.

01:07.850 --> 01:08.894
No, not yet.

01:09.025 --> 01:10.200
Don't blame you.

01:10.331 --> 01:11.375
He will freak the fuck out.

01:11.506 --> 01:13.595
Fuck.

01:13.725 --> 01:14.900
We have a job for you.

01:15.031 --> 01:16.902
We'll pay you very well.

01:17.033 --> 01:18.687
I don't need your money.

01:18.817 --> 01:19.949
Then we won't pay you
with money.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.169
We'll pay you with silence.

01:22.299 --> 01:23.779
What's that mean?

01:23.909 --> 01:26.347
You're meeting privately
with another man's wife.

01:26.477 --> 01:27.870
There's a lady involved.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.306
Mrs. Troy.

01:29.437 --> 01:30.916
<i>You fucking suicidal lunatic</i>

01:31.047 --> 01:32.309
<i>that you are.</i>

01:32.440 --> 01:33.310
The wife of Gully Troy?

01:33.441 --> 01:34.833
I gather the relevant husband

01:34.964 --> 01:36.705
is a man of strong feeling.

01:36.835 --> 01:38.968
Gully's dangerous.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.970
<i>Mad as a hatter.
The job we have</i>

01:41.101 --> 01:42.754
in mind won't take long.
It's a simple extraction.

01:42.885 --> 01:44.713
<i>One man.</i>

01:46.497 --> 01:47.585
Professor Fox, we have to go.

01:47.716 --> 01:49.761
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:51.154 --> 01:52.199
What have you got for us,
Professor?

01:52.329 --> 01:53.243
Film.

01:53.374 --> 01:54.853
Stormcloud.

01:54.984 --> 01:56.681
<i>The new version is at least</i>

01:56.812 --> 01:58.422
<i>five times more powerful
than projected.</i>

01:58.553 --> 02:00.772
They could kill
the entire population of London

02:00.903 --> 02:03.384
with a device the size
of a cigarette lighter.

02:03.514 --> 02:04.776
Someone's grassed us up.

02:04.907 --> 02:05.864
<i>Has he been acting strange
at all?</i>

02:05.995 --> 02:07.301
No.

02:07.431 --> 02:08.693
Don't take the chance.

02:08.824 --> 02:10.695
<i>Get out of there.</i>

02:10.826 --> 02:12.784
Thank you for letting me know.

02:40.812 --> 02:42.597
-Hello, Alfie.
-All right, boys.

03:18.633 --> 03:19.982
Melanie.

03:20.112 --> 03:21.418
Fuck's sake.

03:21.549 --> 03:23.028
You're lucky I didn't kill you.

03:23.159 --> 03:24.813
Mm. Well, that's me.

03:24.943 --> 03:26.162
Lucky.

03:26.293 --> 03:27.772
-What are you doing here?

03:27.903 --> 03:29.078
Should I not have come?

03:29.209 --> 03:30.732
You're taking a big risk.

03:30.862 --> 03:31.994
The risk's half the fun, no?

03:32.124 --> 03:33.300
No.

03:35.563 --> 03:37.608
Gully doesn't know anything.

03:37.739 --> 03:39.001
Stands to reason.

03:39.131 --> 03:40.698
Neither of us
would be walking around.

03:40.829 --> 03:42.439
Someone knows.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.615
-People know.
-Fuck people.

03:45.877 --> 03:47.705
Do you want to get found out?

03:47.836 --> 03:48.793
Do you have a death wish?

03:48.924 --> 03:50.882
Hmm.

03:51.013 --> 03:53.755
We're asking
the deep questions now.

03:53.885 --> 03:55.017
Okay.

03:58.063 --> 04:00.892
Why are you ashamed
of who you really are?

04:01.023 --> 04:02.981
Who's that then?

04:03.112 --> 04:05.201
Oh, you play
this hard-hearted tough guy,

04:05.332 --> 04:06.855
but, actually,
you're kind of a softie.

04:06.985 --> 04:08.726
Mm, feminine almost.

04:08.857 --> 04:09.988
-Get out.

04:10.119 --> 04:12.252
-You're a do-gooder.
-Mm.

04:12.382 --> 04:14.428
You only like me because
you think I need rescuing.

04:14.558 --> 04:16.430
You got me all wrong, love.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.388
-Heart of stone, me.
-Mm.

04:18.519 --> 04:19.911
See?

04:20.042 --> 04:21.739
Ashamed.

04:21.870 --> 04:23.306
Did you come here
for the banter or what?

04:23.437 --> 04:25.047
Mm-mmm.

04:35.579 --> 04:37.799
-Need.

04:39.409 --> 04:41.803
I appeal to you, my people,
at this time of great need.

04:41.933 --> 04:44.022
Uh, I...

04:44.153 --> 04:48.940
urge you, my people,
at this critical time.

04:49.071 --> 04:51.943
I urge you, my people,
at this critical time.

04:52.074 --> 04:53.554
...intercepted
before they reach the capital.

04:53.684 --> 04:56.687
<i>No supper for the League
tonight.</i>

04:56.818 --> 05:00.256
<i>We sign off with greetings
to our leader, Lord Harwood,</i>

05:00.387 --> 05:03.085
<i>who's taking some time off
at his country estate,</i>

05:03.215 --> 05:05.000
<i>recovering from a bout of the flu.</i>

05:05.130 --> 05:06.828
Bloody liars.

05:06.958 --> 05:08.046
<i>We wish him all the very best.</i>

05:08.177 --> 05:10.048
<i>Get well soon, Your Lordship.</i>

05:29.024 --> 05:30.852
It's beautiful, isn't it?

05:35.335 --> 05:37.162
-Sir...
-It's all right, old chap.

05:37.293 --> 05:38.947
Just gonna sit
under the old walnut tree.

05:39.077 --> 05:40.296
This is your perimeter, sir.

05:40.427 --> 05:42.124
Father planted it
on my seventh birthday.

05:42.254 --> 05:44.518
I'm sorry, sir.
You can't go any further.

05:44.648 --> 05:45.823
Don't be absurd.

05:45.954 --> 05:47.259
It's only ten feet away.

05:47.390 --> 05:48.739
Do I look
like I'm gonna run off?

05:48.870 --> 05:49.871
-Orders.

06:11.066 --> 06:12.067
You, Colonel Salt?

06:12.197 --> 06:14.025
-In charge?
-Colonel as was.

06:14.156 --> 06:15.375
"Sir John Salt" being
my current title.

06:15.505 --> 06:17.333
In charge
of the whole damn country?

06:17.464 --> 06:19.727
Yeah, it seems strange
to me, too, but there we are.

06:19.857 --> 06:22.120
-I shall do my best.
-What about the Union Council?

06:22.251 --> 06:24.166
An advisory body, sir.

06:24.296 --> 06:26.647
When the chancellor's
indisposed,

06:26.777 --> 06:28.692
the Union constitution
stipulates

06:28.823 --> 06:31.042
that his deputy administers
business until such time

06:31.173 --> 06:34.089
as the chancellor is fit
for duty again.

06:34.219 --> 06:36.221
Or, if he is unable to return,

06:36.352 --> 06:37.614
an election can be held.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.268
Ridiculous. But very well.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.792
You can start
by putting Harwood on trial.

06:43.794 --> 06:46.188
-Trial?
-Speedy trial for murder

06:46.318 --> 06:48.669
or commitment
to a lunatic asylum.

06:48.799 --> 06:51.149
-The Army won't settle for less.
-Nor should they.

06:52.716 --> 06:53.935
But a trial now?

06:55.327 --> 06:58.287
It would be a terrible blow
to the war effort.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.158
And the war's near won.

07:01.377 --> 07:02.987
Only London remains.

07:03.118 --> 07:05.207
A war won mostly by the Army
so far.

07:05.337 --> 07:07.252
We will win,

07:07.383 --> 07:09.907
with or without
your Raven Union militias.

07:10.038 --> 07:11.605
With or without Harwood.

07:11.735 --> 07:13.215
I'm sure you're right, General.

07:13.345 --> 07:15.957
So why talk of disunity
at this bright moment?

07:16.087 --> 07:17.828
If we simply bide our time

07:17.959 --> 07:20.570
and keep Harwood locked up
safe and quiet on his estate

07:20.701 --> 07:21.963
until victory is ours,

07:22.093 --> 07:24.226
-would that be such a crime?
-Mm.

07:24.356 --> 07:26.010
We need him alive and well
for now,

07:26.141 --> 07:27.534
smiling for the newsreels.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.711
Nobody need know
he's your prisoner.

07:30.841 --> 07:32.364
Perhaps you're right.

07:32.495 --> 07:35.411
And if,
as an absolute last resort,

07:35.542 --> 07:38.109
we were forced
to use Stormcloud...

07:40.372 --> 07:42.853
...it would be done
in Harwood's name.

07:42.984 --> 07:44.725
God forbid.

07:44.855 --> 07:45.900
Hmm?

07:46.030 --> 07:47.771
Oh, yes, indeed.

07:49.381 --> 07:50.861
God forbid.

07:53.124 --> 07:54.256
Now, in the meantime,

07:54.386 --> 07:55.257
I think it's best
we formulate a plan

07:55.387 --> 07:57.346
-in Harwood's absence.
-Yes, yes.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.957
I understand
the southern territories are...

08:11.099 --> 08:13.188
Sykes' Pain Supplies.

08:13.318 --> 08:14.885
Is that Bet?

08:15.016 --> 08:16.060
Bet Sykes?

08:16.191 --> 08:17.932
No, it's Peg, her sister.

08:18.062 --> 08:19.020
Who's this?

08:19.150 --> 08:21.718
I work for Raven HQ.

08:21.849 --> 08:23.328
I transfer Lord Harwood's calls.

08:23.459 --> 08:25.940
Oh, yes, love.

08:26.070 --> 08:28.029
Is anything wrong?

08:28.159 --> 08:31.075
<i>Yes, actually.</i>

08:31.206 --> 08:32.207
<i>There is something wrong.</i>

09:26.478 --> 09:27.871
The president and her people

09:28.002 --> 09:30.221
<i>have discussed your report
in depth.</i>

09:30.352 --> 09:32.223
<i>They've decided
we're gonna let this one ride.</i>

09:32.354 --> 09:34.312
You're doing nothing?

09:34.443 --> 09:36.532
-No action? <i>
-Plenty action.</i>

09:36.663 --> 09:38.186
<i>All but essential
U.S. government personnel</i>

09:38.316 --> 09:40.405
<i>are to be evacuated from London.</i>

09:40.536 --> 09:42.756
<i>By stages, as discreetly
as possible, of course.</i>

09:42.886 --> 09:44.366
And then what?

09:44.496 --> 09:46.150
<i>Well, this is
an internal dispute</i>

09:46.281 --> 09:48.065
<i>in a sovereign nation.</i>

09:48.196 --> 09:49.284
<i>None of our business.</i>

09:50.241 --> 09:52.374
A brand-new weapon
of mass destruction

09:52.504 --> 09:55.029
is likely gonna be used
on civilians.

09:55.159 --> 09:56.726
That's not America's business?

09:56.857 --> 09:59.033
<i>No.</i>

09:59.163 --> 10:00.425
Can we at least brief Prime
Minister Aziz on the situation?

10:00.556 --> 10:02.602
The League have no idea
what they're facing.

10:02.732 --> 10:04.908
-The people of London... <i>
-No, absolutely not.</i>

10:05.039 --> 10:07.389
<i>The League leadership
and the London public</i>

10:07.519 --> 10:09.347
<i>will find out about Stormcloud
soon enough.</i>

10:09.478 --> 10:11.262
<i>It's not our job to inform them.</i>

10:11.393 --> 10:12.786
<i>The U.S. government
doesn't officially know</i>

10:12.916 --> 10:14.091
<i>about Stormcloud,</i>

10:14.222 --> 10:16.093
<i>and we don't need to know.</i>

10:16.224 --> 10:17.834
<i>We need deniability.</i>

10:17.965 --> 10:19.401
But you do know.

10:19.531 --> 10:21.272
<i>I'll deny that.</i>

10:21.403 --> 10:22.926
-You...
-Ma'am, surely now is the time

10:23.057 --> 10:25.625
for the U.S. government
to intervene forcefully,

10:25.755 --> 10:28.497
to forbid the use of Stormcloud
under international laws.

10:28.628 --> 10:32.327
<i>If Stormcloud is used,</i>

10:32.457 --> 10:35.330
<i>it'll end the war
pretty damn quick, right?</i>

10:38.420 --> 10:41.118
Uh, well...

10:41.249 --> 10:43.294
Well, yes, I guess it would.

10:43.425 --> 10:47.037
<i>Well, your president thinks
ending wars quickly is good.</i>

10:51.172 --> 10:53.478
My God.

10:53.609 --> 10:57.047
You sons of bitches want them
to use Stormcloud?

10:57.178 --> 11:00.311
<i>Dr. Fox, you've been through
a harrowing experience.</i>

11:00.442 --> 11:03.358
<i>Emotional feelings
are only to be expected.</i>

11:03.488 --> 11:06.187
<i>You'll both be on the embassy
flight tomorrow, without fail.</i>

11:06.317 --> 11:07.841
<i>Now, until then,</i>

11:07.971 --> 11:09.190
<i>you speak to no one.</i>

11:10.452 --> 11:12.367
<i>Silence.</i>

11:12.497 --> 11:13.455
<i>Clear?</i>

11:13.585 --> 11:15.457
Clear, Chief.

11:15.587 --> 11:17.851
-Very clear.
-Wait a minute. You...

11:17.981 --> 11:20.244
You cut me off!

11:20.375 --> 11:22.290
I had so much more
to say to her!

11:22.420 --> 11:24.205
That is
precisely why I cut you off.

11:24.335 --> 11:26.337
I was doing you a favor.

11:28.296 --> 11:31.081
Don't do me any more favors.

11:31.212 --> 11:33.214
Once those people mark you down
as unreliable, you're out.

11:33.344 --> 11:35.303
I want out anyway.

11:35.433 --> 11:36.870
And you are "those people."

11:37.000 --> 11:39.133
Two fair points.

11:39.263 --> 11:42.223
And "those people" are fixing to
drop-drop a literal terror bomb

11:42.353 --> 11:44.094
on the city we're standing in.

11:44.225 --> 11:45.879
And those people want us to
run away without warning anyone.

11:46.009 --> 11:47.663
Again, fair points.

11:47.794 --> 11:48.446
I should've let you dig
a deeper hole for yourself.

11:48.577 --> 11:50.405
I apologize.

11:50.535 --> 11:53.538
How the heck can you be so calm
and complacent?

11:53.669 --> 11:55.192
Are you seriously gonna go along
with this shit?

11:55.323 --> 11:56.498
I'm just as mad as you are.

11:56.628 --> 11:57.934
We work
for coldhearted sons of bitches,

11:58.065 --> 11:59.370
and now they've crossed a line.

11:59.501 --> 12:00.241
There's no use
telling them that.

12:00.371 --> 12:01.416
They know what they are.

12:01.546 --> 12:02.330
You won't change their minds--

12:02.460 --> 12:04.375
you'll only irritate them.

12:04.506 --> 12:05.594
Better than saying
nothing at all.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.988
-I beg to differ.

12:08.118 --> 12:09.554
Someday, when you need
federal research money

12:09.685 --> 12:12.296
for some cockamamie invention,
you'll thank me.

12:17.345 --> 12:18.389
-Hello? <i>
-Martha?</i>

12:18.520 --> 12:20.217
Oh. Hi.

12:20.348 --> 12:22.350
I'm-I'm glad you rang.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.221
-We need to talk. <i>
-Yes, we do.</i>

12:24.352 --> 12:25.092
<i>As soon as possible.</i>

12:25.222 --> 12:26.920
Uh... Yes.

12:27.050 --> 12:29.357
Good. It's important.

12:29.487 --> 12:30.967
Yes, it is.

12:31.098 --> 12:32.577
What is it you're talking about?

12:32.708 --> 12:34.710
Well... what do <i>you</i> want
to talk about?

12:34.841 --> 12:37.539
Well, I don't want to say
over an open line.

12:37.669 --> 12:40.585
Okay, well... same.

12:40.716 --> 12:42.500
Let's say this evening
at your place?

12:42.631 --> 12:44.415
-Um...

12:44.546 --> 12:46.417
I'll be here.

12:46.548 --> 12:47.549
Good.

12:50.595 --> 12:52.946
Huh.

12:53.076 --> 12:54.295
-What? <i>
Huh.</i>

12:54.425 --> 12:55.557
-What? <i>
Just...</i>

12:55.687 --> 12:57.080
huh.

13:01.389 --> 13:03.391
He was acting kind of weird.

13:03.521 --> 13:04.566
So were you.

13:04.696 --> 13:06.524
No, thanks.

13:06.655 --> 13:07.525
Oh, right.

13:10.528 --> 13:11.529
Taxi!

13:14.097 --> 13:15.577
-I apologize.
-For what?

13:15.707 --> 13:17.666
For calling you
one of those people.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.363
I am one of those people.

13:19.494 --> 13:21.235
I need a drink.
Do you drink, Lucius?

13:21.365 --> 13:23.150
I will drink you
under the porch.

13:26.631 --> 13:28.546
Two quid? You're robbing me,
Mr. Applebaum.

13:28.677 --> 13:30.461
Robbing you? I'm killing myself.

13:30.592 --> 13:31.549
That's solid oak, that is.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.029
Oak shmoke.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.465
By next week, matchwood, maybe.

13:34.596 --> 13:36.554
You've been saying that
for years.

13:36.685 --> 13:37.381
-And now I'm right.

13:37.512 --> 13:38.774
That's a fiver, at least.

13:38.905 --> 13:41.690
Alfie boy,
talk sense to your mum.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.083
-They've got us surrounded.

13:43.213 --> 13:44.649
London might be burning
next week.

13:44.780 --> 13:46.956
-That right?
-Gonna kill all of us,

13:47.087 --> 13:48.305
those that aren't making

13:48.436 --> 13:50.090
-their lucky escape.

13:50.220 --> 13:51.439
And she wants five pounds
for that?

13:56.139 --> 13:57.358
Good morning, Alfie.

13:59.403 --> 14:00.970
All right, Gully.

14:02.015 --> 14:04.495
I'll be in the kitchen
if you need me, Alfie.

14:07.194 --> 14:09.283
Come back later, Mr. A.

14:09.413 --> 14:10.501
All right, mate.

14:13.548 --> 14:15.071
-I'd like to apologize

14:15.202 --> 14:17.378
for the way it all ended up
on the last job.

14:17.508 --> 14:20.685
Things got
a little bit, uh, minty.

14:20.816 --> 14:23.297
I've ironed the problem out
now though.

14:23.427 --> 14:25.212
Mm.

14:25.342 --> 14:27.997
So...

14:28.128 --> 14:30.260
you really are leaving then.

14:31.174 --> 14:32.436
Told you I was.

14:32.567 --> 14:34.003
Hmm.
I've got one last job for you.

14:34.134 --> 14:35.048
Real beauty.

14:35.178 --> 14:36.527
I'm in the air tomorrow.

14:38.181 --> 14:39.574
What's the hurry, Alfie?

14:39.704 --> 14:43.447
Huh? Airplanes leave every week.

14:43.578 --> 14:45.449
You'll find someone else.

14:45.580 --> 14:47.321
I don't want anybody else.

14:48.496 --> 14:49.627
I want you, Alfie.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.850
Let me tell you about the job,
at least.

14:54.981 --> 14:58.506
Your share would be ten grand,
minimum.

15:01.074 --> 15:03.685
You could have a tunnel
under Threadneedle Street.

15:03.815 --> 15:05.078
Makes no difference.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.296
I'm leaving tomorrow.

15:07.732 --> 15:10.083
You were just gonna, uh...

15:10.213 --> 15:11.867
disappear, were you?

15:11.998 --> 15:14.435
Without so much
as a word of farewell.

15:14.565 --> 15:16.480
There's been no time.

15:19.440 --> 15:23.357
Well, I'm glad we had this
chance to say goodbye at least.

15:24.401 --> 15:25.533
Yeah.

15:25.663 --> 15:27.578
Mm.

15:36.761 --> 15:39.025
Is there something
you're not telling me, Alfie?

15:39.155 --> 15:40.330
No.

15:41.592 --> 15:43.072
Oh, well,
there must be something.

15:43.203 --> 15:44.552
Must be.

15:44.682 --> 15:46.423
No.

15:49.209 --> 15:50.645
There is, isn't there?

15:52.212 --> 15:53.735
No.

15:53.865 --> 15:55.563
I beg, beg,

15:55.693 --> 15:57.565
mind you,

15:57.695 --> 15:59.915
a dear old comrade for help

16:00.046 --> 16:03.571
and he refuses me because
he has a flight to catch?

16:04.746 --> 16:06.487
Seems improbable to me.

16:06.617 --> 16:09.446
Fuck's sake, Gully.

16:09.577 --> 16:11.448
I'm going to America.

16:11.579 --> 16:13.581
The flight's booked.

16:13.711 --> 16:15.452
I got tickets with
seat numbers and everything.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.412
Mm.

16:19.543 --> 16:20.718
Right. Cheerio.

16:20.849 --> 16:22.590
Cheerio.

16:24.331 --> 16:26.507
You're breaking my heart, Alfie.

16:28.639 --> 16:30.424
You're breaking
my fucking heart.

16:55.275 --> 16:56.580
Ooh, look, love, new boys.

16:56.711 --> 16:58.104
-Passes, please.
-Passes?

16:58.234 --> 16:59.583
We live here.

16:59.714 --> 17:00.758
You've still
to show your passes.

17:00.889 --> 17:03.196
Cheeky monkey. Ignore 'em, Bet.

17:03.326 --> 17:04.806
-Passes, indeed.
-Wait a sec.

17:04.936 --> 17:07.330
Touch me
and I'll scream bloody murder.

17:07.461 --> 17:09.724
She will, you know.
Klaxon with tits, this one.

17:09.854 --> 17:11.595
I'm warning you.
Not a finger.

17:11.726 --> 17:13.293
What's all this then?

17:13.423 --> 17:15.295
-They'd not show their passes.
-Is that so?

17:15.425 --> 17:16.774
Oi!

17:26.697 --> 17:27.481
Hmm.

17:29.918 --> 17:31.615
Just leave it on the side,
ladies.

17:31.746 --> 17:33.052
Oh, my God.

17:33.182 --> 17:36.098
-Look at the state of you.
Girls!

17:36.229 --> 17:38.274
-How on earth did you get in?
-Well, never mind that.

17:38.405 --> 17:39.797
We've come to get you out.

17:39.928 --> 17:41.277
We've got a car and a driver
down the road.

17:41.408 --> 17:42.713
Well, that's very heroic of you,

17:42.844 --> 17:43.671
but how do you propose
to do that?

17:43.801 --> 17:44.976
That's the British Army outside.

17:45.107 --> 17:47.588
A dozen pimpled squaddies.
No trouble.

17:47.718 --> 17:48.850
Well, go and get
your toiletries,

17:48.980 --> 17:50.243
some clean underpants
and we'll be away.

17:50.373 --> 17:52.506
-I suppose you heard what I did.

17:52.636 --> 17:54.595
I lost my temper,

17:54.725 --> 17:55.857
killed a poor boy.

17:55.987 --> 17:57.946
-Beat him to death.
-Yeah, we heard.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.904
Could happen to anyone.

18:00.035 --> 18:01.950
I should have stayed
in Salford with you two.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.648
-I was happy there.
-I told you as much at the time.

18:04.779 --> 18:05.910
Now, by all means,
feel sorry for yourself,

18:06.041 --> 18:08.087
but we've just duffed up
several squaddies,

18:08.217 --> 18:11.090
-so we need to be away sharpish.
-No, I-I'm beaten.

18:11.220 --> 18:13.744
The Army will never forgive me.
Salt planned it all along.

18:13.875 --> 18:15.877
He removed my family
and my allies

18:16.007 --> 18:17.661
and then he led me
by the nose to ruin,

18:17.792 --> 18:19.881
like the foolish old goat I am.

18:20.011 --> 18:21.317
Salt?

18:21.448 --> 18:22.840
-That speccy plonker?
-I know.

18:22.971 --> 18:24.712
It's hard to credit, isn't it?

18:24.842 --> 18:26.975
My people came over
with the Conqueror.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.890
We fought at Poitiers,
Agincourt, Water-fucking-loo.

18:30.892 --> 18:32.328
And here I am,

18:32.459 --> 18:35.026
deposed and deceived
by a jumped-up grocer.

18:35.157 --> 18:37.159
He made himself indispensable
to me,

18:37.290 --> 18:39.770
and now he's done exactly the
same to the Army and the Union.

18:39.901 --> 18:41.990
And while he's ruling
in my name as my deputy,

18:42.121 --> 18:43.600
then no one dare touch him.

18:43.731 --> 18:44.949
Not if you stop him.

18:45.080 --> 18:48.127
The best way to stop him
is to die now.

18:48.257 --> 18:50.041
With me dead, he won't be able
to rule in my name.

18:50.172 --> 18:51.695
He won't last long
without that leverage.

18:51.826 --> 18:53.044
But then you'd be dead.

18:53.175 --> 18:54.394
So let's keep
our thinking hats on, eh?

18:54.524 --> 18:56.091
-Too right.
-No, good. You're right.

18:56.222 --> 18:57.701
I can't exactly kill myself,
can I?

18:57.832 --> 18:59.138
-Cardinal sin and all that.
-Correct.

18:59.268 --> 19:01.705
So let's be away
before someone raises the alarm.

19:03.316 --> 19:04.969
Lord Harwood,
the house is surrounded

19:05.100 --> 19:06.928
<i>by a battalion
of the 3rd Rutland Infantry.</i>

19:07.058 --> 19:08.886
<i>You cannot escape.</i>

19:09.017 --> 19:11.019
<i>I ask you to surrender yourself
and your accomplices</i>

19:11.150 --> 19:12.499
<i>without further violence.</i>

19:12.629 --> 19:14.109
Sorry, ladies.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.459
I seem to have led you
into a sad predicament.

19:16.590 --> 19:18.679
It's not your fault.
We came of our own accord.

19:18.809 --> 19:20.376
Mind you,
if you hadn't dithered...

19:20.507 --> 19:21.986
No point nagging him now, eh?

19:23.510 --> 19:25.033
How old are those sandwiches?

19:25.164 --> 19:27.688
Oh, they're jolly good.
You should help yourself.

19:27.818 --> 19:30.386
-I wasn't nagging him.
-You were.

19:30.517 --> 19:31.779
No, I was merely pointing out

19:31.909 --> 19:32.954
that if we'd left
five minutes earlier,

19:33.084 --> 19:34.390
we'd be
in a better position now.

19:34.521 --> 19:36.392
That's what nags do.

19:36.523 --> 19:37.915
They merely point things out.

19:38.046 --> 19:38.960
Clear.

19:39.090 --> 19:40.353
I'll secure the library.

19:40.483 --> 19:41.745
You there.

19:43.443 --> 19:45.053
You tell them for me.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.838
I don't want any more bloodshed,

19:47.969 --> 19:50.363
but I don't trust
you Army chaps.

19:50.493 --> 19:51.973
I'll surrender tomorrow.

19:52.103 --> 19:54.671
Tomorrow and not before.

19:54.802 --> 19:55.977
And only to Colonel Salt.

19:56.107 --> 19:57.935
Only to him.

19:58.066 --> 19:59.633
In person.

19:59.763 --> 20:00.982
Colonel Salt!

20:02.766 --> 20:03.985
Surrender?

20:04.115 --> 20:05.421
Yes.

20:05.552 --> 20:07.423
Well, I bought us some time.

20:07.554 --> 20:10.644
We can have
a-a splendid evening together.

20:10.774 --> 20:13.777
-Just like the old days.
-Lovely.

20:13.908 --> 20:15.866
Couldn't be better.

20:15.997 --> 20:17.694
She's being sarky now
'cause I called her a nag,

20:17.825 --> 20:18.913
but she is, isn't she?

20:19.043 --> 20:20.436
No, I am not.
-You are.

20:20.567 --> 20:21.742
No, I'm not.

20:21.872 --> 20:23.918
To me? Only to me?

20:24.048 --> 20:25.702
They were very specific
on that point, sir.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.226
Typical.

20:27.356 --> 20:29.967
Empty theatrics, Miss Dixon.
Empty theatrics.

20:30.098 --> 20:32.622
-Yes, sir.
-Damn the man!

20:36.147 --> 20:37.975
I'll have to go.

20:39.934 --> 20:42.066
We can't allow this to escalate.

20:42.197 --> 20:44.155
Tell them
I'll be there in the morning.

20:44.286 --> 20:47.158
Reiterate that he's not to be harmed.

20:47.289 --> 20:50.553
Not to be harmed
under any circumstances.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.731
Here we go, eh?!

20:57.343 --> 21:00.389
Make way for Union VIPs.
Let us through.

21:02.913 --> 21:04.393
Glory to the Union!

21:04.524 --> 21:06.134
Glory to Lord Harwood!

21:06.265 --> 21:09.050
Hooray! Glory to the Union!

21:09.180 --> 21:10.878
-Glory to Lord Harwood!
-Hey!

21:16.971 --> 21:18.451
Glory to the Union!

21:18.581 --> 21:20.757
Glory to Lord Harwood!

21:23.151 --> 21:25.806
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

21:31.115 --> 21:33.466
I didn't warm to you,
Thomas, not at first.

21:33.596 --> 21:34.989
Now I begin to like you.

21:35.119 --> 21:36.860
Gee whiz.

21:36.991 --> 21:38.819
You present
as a very conventional,

21:38.949 --> 21:40.647
anally-retentive company man.

21:40.777 --> 21:44.128
But now I see you have
a reckless, romantic side--

21:44.259 --> 21:46.957
a kind of high-functioning
schizophrenia.

21:47.088 --> 21:49.090
Huh. Well, uh,

21:49.220 --> 21:51.135
I didn't much like you
at first either.

21:51.266 --> 21:52.049
The jury's still out.

21:53.964 --> 21:55.879
-Over there! Ha! No!

21:59.970 --> 22:02.886
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:03.017 --> 22:04.975
Still here then?

22:05.106 --> 22:06.107
Off tomorrow.

22:06.237 --> 22:08.805
Bon voyage, dosser.

22:08.936 --> 22:11.330
Yeah. Fair play.

22:21.905 --> 22:23.777
Gentlemen.

22:23.907 --> 22:25.169
My liberator.

22:25.300 --> 22:28.172
I never got a chance
to express my gratitude.

22:28.303 --> 22:30.218
Oh, don't thank me.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.002
It was all Mr. Wayne. Stopped
at nothing to get you out.

22:32.133 --> 22:34.440
Ah. Yes. Um...

22:35.702 --> 22:38.139
-I'm sorry I went to Aziz.

22:38.269 --> 22:39.793
How did he persuade you
in the end?

22:39.923 --> 22:40.968
Never you mind.

22:41.098 --> 22:42.665
Come.

22:42.796 --> 22:43.840
Join us.

22:43.971 --> 22:46.190
Just the one. I'm on duty.

22:46.321 --> 22:47.801
Alfred runs this place.

22:47.931 --> 22:49.368
My last night, I'm happy to say.

22:49.498 --> 22:51.761
Alfred and his mother
are on our same flight tomorrow.

22:53.023 --> 22:53.894
You're leaving, too?

22:54.024 --> 22:54.851
Shh.

22:54.982 --> 22:56.549

A little heavy on the gin,
my love?

26:16.923 --> 26:18.533
-I'm celebrating.
-Oh?

26:18.664 --> 26:21.188
Three winners in a row
at Sandown Park this afternoon.

26:21.318 --> 26:22.406
Oh. Brava.

26:22.537 --> 26:24.887
-Mm.

26:26.193 --> 26:28.108
You don't look very happy.

26:29.065 --> 26:31.459
Well, it's horse racing,
not Zen Buddhism.

26:31.590 --> 26:36.116
Mm, you're never very happy.
Not recently.

26:36.943 --> 26:39.380
It makes me wonder
if everything's quite, um,

26:39.510 --> 26:40.729
shipshape.

26:42.296 --> 26:43.427
-Shipshape?
-Mm.

26:43.558 --> 26:44.690
Why wouldn't it be?

26:44.820 --> 26:46.343
Well, quite.

26:46.474 --> 26:47.780
What could--
what could possibly be wrong?

26:47.910 --> 26:49.956
Everything is shipshape.

26:50.086 --> 26:51.740
Good.

26:51.871 --> 26:54.221
Just checking. Oh...

26:54.351 --> 26:57.050
I'll have a little splash.

27:01.620 --> 27:04.405
You haven't asked if
everything's all right with me.

27:04.535 --> 27:07.147
Is everything all right
with you?

27:07.277 --> 27:10.454
Well, uh, since you ask, uh...

27:10.585 --> 27:13.022
I-I'm feeling
a little sad today.

27:13.153 --> 27:15.372
Why is that?

27:15.503 --> 27:19.333
I went to see...

27:19.463 --> 27:20.987
Alfie.

27:21.117 --> 27:23.250
-Oh?
-Yeah.

27:23.380 --> 27:25.121
Tried to get him
on the next job,

27:25.252 --> 27:27.167
but he said no.

27:27.297 --> 27:29.430
Leaving for America, you know.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.650
Oh. That's a shame.

27:31.780 --> 27:34.348
But I expect you can manage
just fine without him,

27:34.478 --> 27:35.958
can't you?

27:39.396 --> 27:41.747
But, see, it's not just, uh...

27:41.877 --> 27:43.966
not just that.

27:45.011 --> 27:47.274
No, he-he seemed tense,

27:47.404 --> 27:49.711
nervous.

27:50.843 --> 27:54.063
It was almost as if he was...
scared of me.

27:56.022 --> 27:58.415
-Well, I expect he was.
-Mm.

27:58.546 --> 27:59.678
Lots of people
are scared of you.

28:00.635 --> 28:02.202
I have a theory.

28:02.332 --> 28:03.943
Mm?

28:04.073 --> 28:07.163
-Want to hear it?
-I can't stop you.

28:08.295 --> 28:11.515
Yeah, I think...

28:11.646 --> 28:14.301
Alfie was scared of me

28:14.431 --> 28:19.219
because he suspected
that I know the truth.

28:21.221 --> 28:22.483
What truth?

28:22.613 --> 28:24.398
Oh, come on.

28:24.528 --> 28:26.400
-What truth?
-You know.

28:26.530 --> 28:27.923
-I know what?
-The truth.

28:28.054 --> 28:30.839
The truth. The truth.
Gully, stop talking in riddles.

28:30.970 --> 28:32.232
Riddles? No.

28:33.973 --> 28:35.801
A joke...

28:35.931 --> 28:37.019
maybe.

28:45.985 --> 28:47.508
Melanie.

28:47.638 --> 28:49.902
I know.

28:50.032 --> 28:51.164
You know what?

28:51.294 --> 28:52.600
No.

28:52.731 --> 28:55.559
I want to hear you say it.

28:55.690 --> 28:58.432
Oh, come on. Say it.

28:58.562 --> 29:00.521
Just say it. Huh?

29:00.651 --> 29:02.915
-Say it. Tell me. Tell me.

29:03.045 --> 29:04.438
Tell me. Say it.

29:04.568 --> 29:05.700
-Say it!
-You want me to say

29:05.831 --> 29:08.877
that I fucked Alfie Pennyworth,
huh?

29:09.008 --> 29:11.140
Is that what you want?

29:15.014 --> 29:16.363
All right.

29:19.018 --> 29:20.933
-I fucked him.
-Oh.

29:21.063 --> 29:22.499
-And I loved it.
-Hmm.

29:22.630 --> 29:24.458
-Next time,

29:24.588 --> 29:26.286
you can watch if you like.

29:28.549 --> 29:31.334
A whore like you,
why wouldn't you fuck him?

29:31.465 --> 29:32.335
-Now get up!

29:36.731 --> 29:37.645
-Come here. Come here.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.387
Come here.

29:59.362 --> 30:01.103
-Come on. Come on.

30:01.234 --> 30:02.409
Come on.

30:08.067 --> 30:09.198
Over here.

30:29.523 --> 30:31.046
God! God!

30:31.177 --> 30:32.569
-Stop! Stop.

31:07.735 --> 31:09.868
Not that I care what you think,

31:09.998 --> 31:12.522
but do you think
I'm doing the right thing?

31:14.655 --> 31:17.397
Well, I'm glad
I can say yes for once,

31:17.527 --> 31:19.573
without a shadow of a doubt.

31:21.096 --> 31:22.576
Obviously.

31:25.013 --> 31:28.016
You're getting your mother
and yourself out of harm's way.

31:28.147 --> 31:30.192
Exactly.

31:31.541 --> 31:33.326
Stay here and fight?

31:33.456 --> 31:35.545
Why? What for?

31:35.676 --> 31:37.547
Can't hold back the tide.

31:37.678 --> 31:40.072
Can't be done.

31:40.202 --> 31:42.770
Isaac Newton sorted all that.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.728
Isaac Newton sorted what?

31:44.859 --> 31:48.471
Tides. Caused by the gravity
of the moon.

31:48.602 --> 31:49.864
I know how bloody tides work.

31:49.995 --> 31:53.041
I'm saying
you can't argue with gravity.

31:53.172 --> 31:54.216
Oh, really?

31:57.872 --> 31:59.700
Speak for yourself.

32:03.269 --> 32:05.706
Who are you talking to?

32:05.836 --> 32:07.447
Melanie.

32:07.577 --> 32:10.711
I was, um, thinking aloud.

32:12.495 --> 32:13.888
What happened?

32:14.019 --> 32:16.760
-Are you all right?
-Been better.

32:16.891 --> 32:18.545
-Eh.

32:20.373 --> 32:21.678
Come on.

32:32.646 --> 32:35.083
He said you seemed scared.

32:35.214 --> 32:38.173
Made him suspicious.

32:38.304 --> 32:41.611
That's it? That's all he has?

32:43.135 --> 32:44.571
Were you?

32:44.701 --> 32:46.573
Scared.

32:46.703 --> 32:49.141
No.

32:49.271 --> 32:51.447
Well, maybe a bit.

32:53.797 --> 32:57.758
I denied everything,
but he just-- he knew.

32:57.888 --> 33:01.457
And he attacked me
and strangled me.

33:01.588 --> 33:04.808
I hit him with a vase.

33:04.939 --> 33:08.116
I think he's hurt,
but I don't know.

33:08.247 --> 33:10.118
There was a lot of blood.

33:10.249 --> 33:12.512
I ran away.

33:12.642 --> 33:14.557
You don't know where he is now?

33:14.688 --> 33:16.516
No.

33:20.694 --> 33:23.001
Turns out you were wrong.

33:24.654 --> 33:26.743
I don't have a death wish.

33:26.874 --> 33:28.832
I was actually...

33:28.963 --> 33:30.921
very frightened.

33:31.052 --> 33:33.533
Well, there's
a silver lining then.

33:34.577 --> 33:36.536
No death wish.

33:37.798 --> 33:39.756
And you're safe here.

33:44.500 --> 33:48.591
As angry as he was, I could see
in his heart that he was glad.

33:49.940 --> 33:53.640
Now he can be his true self.

33:53.770 --> 33:57.731
He'll kill me.
I'm not safe anywhere.

34:00.342 --> 34:02.475
I'll handle Gully.

34:04.955 --> 34:07.262
No.

34:07.393 --> 34:11.223
No, you have a plane to catch.

34:11.353 --> 34:13.921
And you'd better be on it.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.663
Or he'll kill you, too.

34:23.104 --> 34:25.193
You'd better come to America
with me then.

34:28.283 --> 34:29.719
Sure.

34:29.850 --> 34:31.547
-Have you got a passport?
-Yes, but...

34:31.678 --> 34:33.114
You're sorted then.

34:33.245 --> 34:34.768
I've still got plenty of cash,
and that's all it takes

34:34.898 --> 34:35.899
-to get you there.
-No, it's a lot of money.

34:36.030 --> 34:38.380
Easy come, easy go.

34:41.818 --> 34:43.733
You...

34:43.864 --> 34:46.214
you would really do that?

34:46.345 --> 34:48.129
For me?

34:48.260 --> 34:50.218
I'm buying you a plane ticket.
I'm not offering marriage.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.569
Yeah, well, I'd have
to say no if you did.

34:53.700 --> 34:55.223
-Would you?
-Mm.

34:55.354 --> 34:56.790
You're not my type.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.619
-Mm. Too soft.

35:00.968 --> 35:02.535
You-You're not...

35:02.665 --> 35:05.233
you're not joking?

35:05.364 --> 35:06.887
America?

35:07.017 --> 35:09.455
What did I just say?

35:11.587 --> 35:14.895
Well, I'm going to America.

35:23.991 --> 35:25.253
-Sorry.

35:25.384 --> 35:26.776
No, kiss me.

35:54.021 --> 35:54.935
Martha?

35:56.589 --> 35:57.546
Martha.

35:59.069 --> 36:00.636
Martha!

36:01.898 --> 36:03.465
Martha.

36:08.775 --> 36:10.472
Good day, Miss Kane.

36:11.299 --> 36:13.083
-Sorry it's late.
-Late?

36:13.214 --> 36:14.824
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

36:14.955 --> 36:17.610
Yes. I have
an excellent internal clock.

36:17.740 --> 36:21.004
It is 1:35.

36:21.135 --> 36:22.397
Rhetorical question.

36:22.528 --> 36:24.269
Oh. I hate those.

36:24.399 --> 36:26.749
Martha.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.186
You have to get out of here
right now.

36:28.316 --> 36:30.144
-What are you talking about?
-Stormcloud.

36:30.275 --> 36:32.277
What about Stormcloud?
What is it?

36:32.407 --> 36:33.843
Chemical weapon.

36:33.974 --> 36:35.802
Very, very bad.

36:35.932 --> 36:37.586
They are going to use it
on London.

36:37.717 --> 36:40.067
And the U.S. government
is going to look the other way.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.677
They want the war over. They're
not gonna tell the League

36:41.808 --> 36:42.722
what they know.

36:42.852 --> 36:44.506
But you just told me.

36:44.637 --> 36:45.681
So you know I'm going straight
to Aziz with this.

36:45.812 --> 36:47.553
Well, I hope so.

36:47.683 --> 36:50.730
The best way to stop Stormcloud
is public exposure.

36:50.860 --> 36:52.775
If Aziz yells loud enough,

36:52.906 --> 36:54.864
the White House
can't feign ignorance.

36:54.995 --> 36:56.388
The president can't
openly support a war crime.

36:56.518 --> 36:57.867
She'll have to intervene.

36:57.998 --> 36:58.955
I'll go to Aziz first thing.

36:59.086 --> 37:01.828
Well, uh,

37:01.958 --> 37:03.438
don't tell him who told you.

37:03.569 --> 37:05.266
I think he'll know anyhow.

37:05.397 --> 37:07.877
Well, if anyone asks,
I'll deny telling you anything.

37:08.008 --> 37:09.009
Unless, of course,
I'm under oath. But I...

37:10.532 --> 37:11.620
I doubt it will come to that.

37:13.448 --> 37:14.754
Hmm.

37:18.932 --> 37:19.846
What?

37:21.587 --> 37:24.024
I'm... I'm just surprised.

37:24.154 --> 37:27.157
And glad.
You're doing the right thing.

37:27.288 --> 37:29.116
Well, I'm glad you're glad, but
I'm surprised you're surprised.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.074
Why would I not try to stop
a mass murder?

37:31.205 --> 37:34.382
I don't know. To... avoid
seeming unconventional?

37:34.513 --> 37:35.992
She's got your number.

37:36.123 --> 37:38.821
You know your bosses
will work out who talked.

37:38.952 --> 37:40.083
Deniability's all I need.

37:40.214 --> 37:41.824
Okay.

37:41.955 --> 37:42.912
Okay, you're denied.

37:43.043 --> 37:44.566
Martha, where's the aspirin?

37:45.524 --> 37:46.742
Hi.

37:46.873 --> 37:48.396
I'm Patricia.

37:48.527 --> 37:49.876
Who are you?

37:50.006 --> 37:50.877
Lucius.

37:51.007 --> 37:52.444
Oh.

37:52.574 --> 37:54.097
Say that again.

37:54.228 --> 37:56.056
-Lucius?

37:56.186 --> 37:57.884
You have got such
a lovely timbre

37:58.014 --> 37:59.102
-to your voice.

37:59.233 --> 38:01.714
Why is everyone so glum?

38:01.844 --> 38:02.889
And what are you doing here?

38:03.019 --> 38:04.717
My sister.

38:04.847 --> 38:07.197
Pat, focus.

38:07.328 --> 38:09.635
There may soon be
a chemical attack on London.

38:09.765 --> 38:12.333
We're booked on a U.S.
government flight leaving today.

38:12.464 --> 38:14.814
We're all getting on
that flight. Pat, no arguments.

38:14.944 --> 38:16.250
Oh. I'll be on it. Absolutely.

38:16.381 --> 38:19.122
I despise chemicals.
Don't you, Lucius?

38:19.253 --> 38:20.863
Just to be clear,
I'm not going anywhere.

38:20.994 --> 38:22.778
Of course not. That figures.

38:22.909 --> 38:24.302
You're not going?

38:24.432 --> 38:25.868
We can stop them.
We can stop Stormcloud.

38:25.999 --> 38:27.957
-Oh, please.
-We have to.

38:28.088 --> 38:29.307
Martha, you have to go.
What about...

38:29.437 --> 38:31.657
No! Come on, Patricia.
Let's make some coffee.

38:35.661 --> 38:37.489
-See what I have to deal with?

38:37.619 --> 38:39.142
-Uh-huh.

38:48.282 --> 38:51.111
Right. That'll be him.

38:51.241 --> 38:52.939
-About bloody time.

39:06.300 --> 39:07.519
There you are.

39:07.649 --> 39:09.912
We've been worried sick.

39:10.043 --> 39:11.784
Now, Mum,

39:11.914 --> 39:13.002
this is Melanie.

39:13.133 --> 39:15.135
Melanie, my mum.

39:15.265 --> 39:18.834
Very nice to meet you,
Mrs. Pennyworth.

39:18.965 --> 39:20.793
Long story.
She's coming with us.

39:20.923 --> 39:22.011
Mm.

39:52.085 --> 39:54.000
Be back in a minute.

39:59.266 --> 40:01.007
Mrs. P.

40:01.137 --> 40:02.791
Sit there.

40:04.663 --> 40:06.012
Hi.

40:08.144 --> 40:09.972
And, um,

40:10.103 --> 40:12.018
that covers everything, right?

40:12.148 --> 40:14.063
Yes, sir.

40:14.194 --> 40:16.022
Just a few questions
for English border control.

40:18.111 --> 40:20.200
Reason for departure?

40:20.330 --> 40:21.984
Reason?

40:22.115 --> 40:23.812
Why are you leaving England?

40:25.205 --> 40:26.554
Lots of reasons.

40:26.685 --> 40:28.817
Business or pleasure?

40:30.776 --> 40:32.908
Is it business or pleasure?

40:33.039 --> 40:36.303
Oh. Uh, business.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.827
Have you flown before,
Mrs. Pennyworth?

40:39.698 --> 40:40.960
No.

40:41.090 --> 40:42.135
It's a little scary at first,

40:42.265 --> 40:44.137
but then it's-it's quite fun.

40:45.878 --> 40:48.794
I expect you're
a very experienced traveler.

40:48.924 --> 40:50.099
I am.

40:51.231 --> 40:53.451
Like to keep moving, do you?

40:53.581 --> 40:55.191
Flight is now ready to board.

40:57.280 --> 40:59.152
Here's-here's Alfie back.

41:06.768 --> 41:08.770
Off we go then.

41:13.906 --> 41:15.864
All passengers will depart...

41:31.750 --> 41:32.881
What is it?

41:35.057 --> 41:37.016
I can't go.

41:42.412 --> 41:44.066
I can't go.

41:46.329 --> 41:48.244
Thank you, God.

41:50.116 --> 41:52.901
For fuck's sake, Alfie.

42:03.433 --> 42:06.219
I can't go, but you can.

42:06.349 --> 42:08.047
You have to go.

42:16.446 --> 42:18.927
Try and stop me.

42:21.321 --> 42:23.845
What changed your mind
so suddenly?

42:25.630 --> 42:28.241
Stuff that sounds stupid
if you say it out loud.

42:30.156 --> 42:31.505
This is my home.

42:31.636 --> 42:33.115
If that's not
worth fighting for,

42:33.246 --> 42:35.204
then what is worth fighting for?

42:39.208 --> 42:40.949
Yeah, it does sound stupid.

42:44.300 --> 42:47.086
We would have been good
together.

42:48.304 --> 42:51.003
-We would.

42:52.482 --> 42:55.485
But in the long run,
you'll be better off without me.

42:55.616 --> 42:57.400
Bit of independence
is just the ticket.

43:01.796 --> 43:03.581
Will you be okay?

43:05.844 --> 43:08.281
Mm. Mm.

43:08.411 --> 43:10.718
I will be fine.

43:10.849 --> 43:12.981
I always land on my feet.

43:14.853 --> 43:16.898
What about you?

43:17.899 --> 43:20.119
Don't worry about me.

43:20.249 --> 43:22.556
-I got feet, too.

43:22.687 --> 43:25.298
Passengers for Flight 011 to Gotham

43:25.428 --> 43:27.256
<i>proceed to immediate boarding.</i>

43:27.387 --> 43:29.345
<i>-That's immediate boarding.</i>

43:29.476 --> 43:31.391
-Hey, don't cry.

43:31.521 --> 43:32.958
No, I'm not.

43:33.872 --> 43:36.048
It's a good thing
that's happening.

43:37.223 --> 43:38.964
New life for you.

43:40.182 --> 43:41.923
Here you go.

43:50.410 --> 43:55.284
If you ever do get to America,
you look me up.

43:57.417 --> 43:59.114
I'll do that.

44:30.580 --> 44:32.321
Sorry.

44:40.242 --> 44:42.027
I know you.

44:44.377 --> 44:45.247
You do?

44:45.378 --> 44:47.510
I don't forget gorgeous.

44:47.641 --> 44:49.251
Oh, my God, look at you.

44:49.382 --> 44:52.341
I would drown kittens
for those hips.

44:52.472 --> 44:53.342
Patricia.

44:56.432 --> 44:58.260
Melanie.

44:58.391 --> 45:00.349
Fleeing from an angry lover,
huh?

45:00.480 --> 45:02.874
No, no, don't deny it.

45:03.004 --> 45:04.789
What else could it be?

45:04.919 --> 45:07.269
We'll sit together. You're gonna
tell me the whole sordid tale.

45:07.400 --> 45:08.488
Take my mind off the journey.

45:08.618 --> 45:10.708
Are you scared of flying?

45:10.838 --> 45:14.320
No, I love flying.
I don't like airplanes.

45:14.450 --> 45:15.974
My brother was supposed
to come with me,

45:16.104 --> 45:18.454
but he decided to stay
and be a fucking hero.

45:40.607 --> 45:42.522
You're not going?

45:42.652 --> 45:44.045
No.

45:44.176 --> 45:46.308
Really?

45:46.439 --> 45:48.484
After all the trouble you went
through to get there? Why?

45:49.703 --> 45:51.574
Changed my mind.

45:51.705 --> 45:53.794
That's funny.

45:53.925 --> 45:57.058
I can't see a comical side,
but I suppose there is one.

46:00.061 --> 46:02.237
Why aren't you going?

46:02.368 --> 46:04.152
Changed my mind.

46:05.023 --> 46:06.546
Hmm.

46:12.595 --> 46:14.597
You know, Alfred,

46:14.728 --> 46:16.643
I think this
could be the beginning

46:16.774 --> 46:18.732
-of a beautiful friendship.
I doubt it,

46:18.863 --> 46:21.430
-but you never know, do you?

46:45.628 --> 46:47.456
Fuck me.

46:49.110 --> 46:51.286
My thoughts exactly.

46:52.766 --> 46:54.246
Your government knows
about this?

46:54.376 --> 46:55.725
They'll deny it.

46:55.856 --> 46:57.466
They want the Union
to use Stormcloud

46:57.597 --> 46:59.773
without their knowledge
or permission.

46:59.904 --> 47:01.383
Of course. They just want
the damn war over.

47:01.514 --> 47:02.732
Can't blame them, really.

47:02.863 --> 47:03.951
If you present
the U.S. president

47:04.082 --> 47:06.040
with this evidence publicly,

47:06.171 --> 47:07.694
she'll have to intervene.

47:07.825 --> 47:09.304
She can't be seen to stand by
and do nothing.

47:09.435 --> 47:11.654
She can't do nothing.

47:11.785 --> 47:13.526
At the very least,
we'll buy some time.

47:13.656 --> 47:15.876
Thank you, gentlemen.
We owe you a great debt.

47:16.007 --> 47:18.618
I can't believe this was an easy
choice for either of you.

47:18.748 --> 47:20.968
On the contrary.
It was very easy.

47:21.099 --> 47:22.709
I'm thinking of med school.

47:22.840 --> 47:24.363
That's a really great idea.

47:24.493 --> 47:26.408
You'll make an excellent doctor.

47:26.539 --> 47:28.802
Oh, finally,
I get your approval.

47:28.933 --> 47:30.630
Guess I've been kind of hard
on you, huh?

47:30.760 --> 47:32.458
Kinda.

47:39.465 --> 47:41.684
My old friend.

47:43.556 --> 47:45.514
So happy to have you back
in the fold.

47:48.909 --> 47:51.999
I'm already sorry
I didn't get on that plane.

47:52.913 --> 47:55.089
And you're still
a conniving little bastard.

47:55.220 --> 47:57.483
-Mm. Fair cop, guv.
-Mm.

47:59.528 --> 48:00.616
I'm glad to be back, too,
though.

48:00.747 --> 48:02.183
Mm.

48:05.665 --> 48:07.623
-Mm.
-You two have history, huh?

48:09.625 --> 48:11.410
Yeah.

48:55.758 --> 48:58.587
Salt's here.

48:58.718 --> 49:01.503
You're really gonna surrender
to that wanker?

49:01.634 --> 49:04.158
Well, what else are we to do,
brainbox?

49:04.289 --> 49:05.464
I believe I have a better idea.

49:05.594 --> 49:07.074
Oh, yeah? Now? Suddenly?

49:07.205 --> 49:08.075
We kill him, right?

49:08.206 --> 49:10.469
I like it.

49:10.599 --> 49:12.688
No, he'll be well protected.

49:12.819 --> 49:14.777
I shall create a diversion,

49:14.908 --> 49:16.518
draw the soldiers
to the front of the house.

49:16.649 --> 49:19.565
Meanwhile,
you two leave by the back.

49:19.695 --> 49:21.697
You head for the woods,
beyond the garden.

49:21.828 --> 49:23.612
Should work,
if we time it right.

49:23.743 --> 49:25.788
-A distraction?
-Yeah. I'll surrender

49:25.919 --> 49:28.704
and then I'll faint
or-or have a fit or something.

49:28.835 --> 49:31.490
Then, if you can,

49:31.620 --> 49:34.145
you get a message
to Frances Gaunt.

49:34.275 --> 49:35.885
You send her my fondest love,

49:36.016 --> 49:38.105
and you tell her
how deeply sorry I am

49:38.236 --> 49:39.541
for wronging her so cruelly.

49:39.672 --> 49:42.370
But what about you?

49:42.501 --> 49:43.589
Dearest Peg,

49:43.719 --> 49:45.156
Bet,

49:45.286 --> 49:46.766
you trust me?

49:46.896 --> 49:49.987
So trust
that I'll do the right thing.

49:50.117 --> 49:52.554
The greatest gift
that you two can give me now

49:52.685 --> 49:54.600
is your continued survival.

50:00.823 --> 50:02.390
Right.

50:11.921 --> 50:13.619
Lord Harwood,

50:13.749 --> 50:15.925
John Salt here, as requested.

50:16.056 --> 50:18.624
I'm very sorry
we're in this situation.

50:19.755 --> 50:21.496
Let's talk.

50:37.338 --> 50:39.166
-Good morning, sir.
-Silence!

50:39.297 --> 50:40.559
Scum.

50:45.042 --> 50:48.567
Soldiers of the Raven Union.

50:50.395 --> 50:53.615
This man is a treacherous dog.

50:53.746 --> 50:56.879
And I speak to you
as your rightful leader.

50:57.010 --> 51:01.232
We are fighting an unjust
and unnecessary war,

51:01.362 --> 51:03.060
and we must stop.

51:03.190 --> 51:07.803
I order you to lay down
your arms immediately.

51:09.675 --> 51:10.589
I will count to three,

51:10.719 --> 51:13.026
and any man who disobeys

51:13.157 --> 51:17.552
will be committing mutiny
and sedition.

51:19.641 --> 51:20.599
No!

51:21.904 --> 51:24.429
-One!
-Do not fire!

51:25.647 --> 51:27.388
Two!

51:29.869 --> 51:31.523
-Do not fire!
-Three!

51:31.653 --> 51:32.611
