WEBVTT

00:00.008 --> 00:02.126
Got this phenom-kid, you know.

00:02.151 --> 00:04.252
OHL scouts freaking out over him,

00:04.287 --> 00:06.087
and the woman stuff starts.

00:06.122 --> 00:08.710
- Take it off. You're a homo...
- Shut up!

00:08.735 --> 00:10.892
- Dress wearing... weirdo freak.
- Shut up! Shut up!

00:10.927 --> 00:12.761
Agh!

00:12.795 --> 00:15.096
And Grandpa?

00:15.131 --> 00:17.032
He caught a bad one, and it killed him.

00:17.066 --> 00:18.600
Am I like him as a cop?

00:18.634 --> 00:20.101
You're intuitive like him.

00:20.136 --> 00:21.670
And you're emotional like him.

00:21.704 --> 00:22.904
You're tough like me.

00:22.939 --> 00:24.973
- He's back.
- Who's back?

00:25.007 --> 00:26.975
The asshole who sent me riddles.

00:27.009 --> 00:28.743
You sure it's the same guy?

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

00:57.006 --> 00:59.140
So the gash on the back of his head...

00:59.175 --> 01:00.342
He was wounded,

01:00.376 --> 01:02.244
and then the bruise
mid-thorax is circular.

01:02.278 --> 01:03.878
You think he was held underwater?

01:03.913 --> 01:05.812
Means he went in alive.

01:07.038 --> 01:08.883
Jesse had a boyfriend.

01:08.918 --> 01:10.285
They planned on running away together

01:10.319 --> 01:11.686
the night Jesse went missing.

01:11.721 --> 01:13.922
Jesse didn't show, so
Danny went looking for him.

01:13.956 --> 01:16.520
Saw him in a white truck
near the mine at 1:30 AM.

01:16.545 --> 01:18.212
Didn't see the driver.

01:18.237 --> 01:19.928
White truck it is then.

01:20.164 --> 01:22.063
There's tire skids on the road up there.

01:22.098 --> 01:24.065
Maybe we can narrow down
the size of the truck.

01:24.100 --> 01:25.891
Go.

01:31.140 --> 01:33.172
So how the hell did you find that body?

01:38.381 --> 01:40.915
- They're fake.
- They don't look fake.

01:40.950 --> 01:42.594
They fooled Dr. Jack too.

01:42.619 --> 01:45.086
You sent these to the pathologist?

01:45.121 --> 01:47.222
How long have you had them?

01:47.256 --> 01:49.876
I get that you're pissed but...

01:50.126 --> 01:51.704
there's more.

02:01.170 --> 02:03.038
Jesus Christ.

02:03.072 --> 02:05.006
I told you I would find him.

02:05.041 --> 02:06.908
I told you to talk to me
about this fucking guy.

02:06.942 --> 02:09.560
Isn't that the first
thing I said to you?

02:10.344 --> 02:12.345
So what was he trying to show you...

02:12.746 --> 02:15.677
the shack or Jesse?

02:16.240 --> 02:17.719
The shack, but...

02:17.753 --> 02:20.922
I found Jesse because I
was here so I don't know.

02:21.097 --> 02:24.759
There's scratches on the
wall like somebody was tapped.

02:24.933 --> 02:27.896
Sandy Driver disappeared
before the pageant.

02:27.930 --> 02:29.864
Was she held there?

02:30.638 --> 02:33.231
I just pulled a dead
body out of this water

02:33.256 --> 02:35.470
and you're talking to me
about a 20 year old murder?

02:35.504 --> 02:37.146
What if they're connected?

02:37.171 --> 02:40.075
Oh, for Jesus sake, Annie.

02:40.109 --> 02:42.010
If Jesse Shepherd was at the church

02:42.044 --> 02:44.312
where Sandy's body was
found without fingernails,

02:44.347 --> 02:47.614
and I am sent fingernails
in a doll dressed like Mary,

02:47.639 --> 02:51.256
and told to keep quiet or I won't
learn the truth about either of them.

02:51.281 --> 02:53.288
So what? The shack is just
standing there for 20 years?

02:53.322 --> 02:54.449
It's overgrown.

02:54.474 --> 02:56.758
And it's not a part of town
people go to anymore. Yeah.

02:56.792 --> 02:59.361
- Well, then, show me.
- He watches.

03:00.167 --> 03:01.832
If you go, he'll know I told you.

03:01.856 --> 03:03.299
Well, then he's gonna know when I got

03:03.324 --> 03:04.833
50 fucking cops after him.

03:04.867 --> 03:06.868
I have to deal with this on my own.

03:06.902 --> 03:08.370
You're out of your mind, you know that?

03:08.404 --> 03:10.146
We have a dead kid
and he knows something.

03:10.171 --> 03:11.473
- And if he vanishes then...
- Annie.

03:11.498 --> 03:12.740
Do you hear what I'm saying to you?

03:12.765 --> 03:15.685
- You can't do this alone.
- He thinks we have a bond.

03:15.945 --> 03:20.181
If Sandy Driver was held
in that shack 20 years ago,

03:20.216 --> 03:22.317
we didn't know that, Annie.

03:22.351 --> 03:24.219
So tell me that you understand

03:24.253 --> 03:26.888
that you may be talking
to a killer right now.

03:26.922 --> 03:29.836
Or maybe somebody who
knows things who...

03:30.390 --> 03:32.711
has odd communication skills.

03:35.498 --> 03:37.298
So what's your plan?

03:37.333 --> 03:38.833
I used to leave him things

03:38.858 --> 03:40.851
in exchange for the riddles.

03:45.941 --> 03:48.376
"What I found beyond the horizon."

04:12.400 --> 04:14.043
Hard night?

04:15.304 --> 04:16.838
I just dropped Maggie off

04:16.872 --> 04:20.074
after she ID'd the body of her son.

04:20.108 --> 04:21.964
She ah...

04:25.548 --> 04:27.415
I'm sensitive.

04:27.450 --> 04:29.551
Tell your friends.

04:32.521 --> 04:34.456
Jesse would have had
to have called someone

04:34.490 --> 04:36.391
after the fight in the scrap yard.

04:36.425 --> 04:38.059
Couldn't. Didn't have his phone.

04:38.093 --> 04:39.461
We should check payphones

04:39.495 --> 04:41.863
within a walking distance
of the gas station.

04:42.278 --> 04:44.566
DMV says...

04:44.864 --> 04:49.052
there's 482 white trucks in
Bellevue, Rez, and surrounding area.

04:49.224 --> 04:52.073
739 pale trucks.

04:52.107 --> 04:54.509
I guess we start with A.

04:54.543 --> 04:57.111
Okay, so...

04:57.146 --> 05:02.250
Coroner says Jesse was killed
the night he went missing.

05:02.284 --> 05:04.352
Blunt force head trauma.

05:04.386 --> 05:08.189
Jagged lacerations, from
either a piece of metal or rock,

05:08.224 --> 05:10.258
but the official cause is drowning.

05:10.292 --> 05:11.493
DNA?

05:11.527 --> 05:13.328
No. The water washed it clean.

05:13.362 --> 05:15.943
He was killed near the
entrance to the lake.

05:16.005 --> 05:18.684
It appears his body drifted a bit.

05:18.762 --> 05:21.530
Rock to the head is heat of the moment.

05:21.564 --> 05:24.867
Whoever picked him up didn't
do so intending to kill.

05:24.901 --> 05:27.402
Something happened in the truck.

05:27.437 --> 05:30.272
Take Danny Debassage out
to where he saw the truck

05:30.306 --> 05:31.783
and get him to talk you through it.

05:31.808 --> 05:34.110
I don't know, jog his memory.
See if you can get anything.

05:34.135 --> 05:36.166
Okay.

05:36.667 --> 05:39.349
Gather around, guys!

05:39.459 --> 05:41.738
Sorry.

05:42.014 --> 05:43.973
I'm making a tribute video.

05:50.647 --> 05:52.849
Highlights from practice tapes.

05:54.031 --> 05:57.133
- Jim, send these to me.
- Sure.

05:57.788 --> 05:59.222
Jesse!

06:03.797 --> 06:05.940
I'm so sorry, Maggie.

06:08.663 --> 06:11.672
You need God's strength.

06:13.193 --> 06:15.628
I never did believe in him.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.330
'Til cops came to my house at 5 AM.

06:21.908 --> 06:23.680
Now I do.

06:23.714 --> 06:25.882
And I know what he's all about.

06:29.982 --> 06:31.355
Punishment.

06:31.380 --> 06:33.881
Is that something you believe in?

06:56.747 --> 06:59.572
So no idea who?

06:59.597 --> 07:02.151
You wanna show me how they got in.

07:02.764 --> 07:04.604
Thank you, Father.

07:07.972 --> 07:09.792
So what's it trying to say?

07:09.827 --> 07:12.228
Joseph. Jesus.

07:12.253 --> 07:13.867
Father. Son.

07:13.941 --> 07:15.780
Betrayal? Violence?

07:17.535 --> 07:19.603
Was Jesse's father violent?

07:20.495 --> 07:22.581
Jesse's dad's dead.

07:23.116 --> 07:25.206
These things aren't straightforward.

07:30.380 --> 07:32.214
"Sandy found dead after disappearing

07:32.239 --> 07:35.161
"from a Christmas
pageant dress rehearsal."

07:35.186 --> 07:36.662
_

07:46.796 --> 07:49.231
Sandy's spirit, hear my call.

07:49.265 --> 07:51.366
Your help I need most of all.

07:51.401 --> 07:54.069
Cross from the dead to the living.

07:54.104 --> 07:56.238
Of this disturbance be forgiving.

07:56.263 --> 07:57.969
Agh!

08:01.510 --> 08:04.106
There's no point in coming back to life.

08:04.131 --> 08:06.524
We'll just kill you again.

08:06.549 --> 08:10.452
Do you hear me? We'll
just kill you again.

08:17.167 --> 08:18.803
His number?

08:18.828 --> 08:21.597
He'd be anywhere for a
minute and have carved it

08:21.631 --> 08:23.665
or written it.

08:23.700 --> 08:26.168
It used to piss me off.

08:26.648 --> 08:29.751
Jesse get along with his
father while he was alive?

08:32.102 --> 08:34.676
Was there any violence between them?

08:34.711 --> 08:38.514
His dad liked to go to the bar
after Jesse's games for attention.

08:38.548 --> 08:42.259
That was about the extent
of their relationship.

08:42.904 --> 08:45.118
Mind if I take a look at this?

08:50.794 --> 08:53.362
Why are you asking about his dad?

08:55.298 --> 08:57.477
'Cause of the girl thing?

08:58.234 --> 09:00.519
Lack of male influence?

09:00.941 --> 09:03.550
I could have gotten married again.

09:05.194 --> 09:08.761
But I didn't think he needed
another asshole in his life.

09:11.273 --> 09:14.198
'Cause he had Tom for all that stuff.

09:14.884 --> 09:17.932
I don't know what we would
have done without him.

09:19.189 --> 09:21.409
Is that Tom's truck?

09:32.403 --> 09:35.105
Show 'em how it's done, Jesse.

09:35.364 --> 09:38.766
All right! Come Jesse! Let's
see what you got. Come on!

09:38.800 --> 09:41.602
See how easy that was.
That's what I want.

09:41.870 --> 09:44.404
Jacob, I hear your favourite
band The Jonas Brothers

09:44.439 --> 09:45.506
are getting back together.

09:45.540 --> 09:47.377
Ya wanna go with me?

09:47.402 --> 09:49.069
You're dead.

09:49.698 --> 09:52.213
- Get him. Get him.
- Jacob! Jacob!

09:52.238 --> 09:54.624
Come on. Show a little
heart for fucks-sake.

09:54.716 --> 09:56.316
Skate! Go! Go! Go!

09:56.351 --> 09:58.919
- Hey, Jackie.
- Hi.

10:00.955 --> 10:04.046
My husband forgot to eat this morning.

10:04.893 --> 10:07.728
I thought those two were
suspended, Jacob and Max.

10:07.762 --> 10:09.530
It's just a practice.

10:09.564 --> 10:11.832
Strange that they're practicing today.

10:11.866 --> 10:13.145
Tom is crushed.

10:13.170 --> 10:17.910
He uh, he spent more energy
on Jesse than the girls.

10:18.879 --> 10:20.507
He copes by being with his team.

10:20.542 --> 10:22.676
You know, Jesse's team.

10:24.879 --> 10:26.847
The girls are in the
car. Do you mind? Thanks.

10:26.881 --> 10:28.585
Come on! Come on!

10:31.130 --> 10:34.722
Jesus Christ. Get up you fucking pussy!

10:34.841 --> 10:37.509
No star to hide behind now.

10:38.426 --> 10:40.717
Come on. Get him up!

10:40.742 --> 10:42.296
Don't touch me, you rat!

10:42.330 --> 10:44.031
Asshole!

10:44.065 --> 10:46.700
Hey, hey! Whoa! Come on! Stop!

10:52.187 --> 10:54.132
Ryder.

10:54.509 --> 10:56.677
I thought I had the room.

11:00.415 --> 11:03.417
Ugh. You need better lighting.

11:03.451 --> 11:05.485
No wonder no girls play hockey.

11:05.520 --> 11:09.517
They do. Just... not ones
who care about lighting.

11:15.179 --> 11:16.802
You're right.

11:17.932 --> 11:19.533
I look a hundred.

11:19.567 --> 11:21.435
I can't believe I go out in public.

11:21.469 --> 11:22.819
Yeah, well...

11:23.771 --> 11:25.038
I wasn't supposed to get old.

11:25.073 --> 11:27.475
You weren't supposed to
leave the house like that.

11:28.776 --> 11:30.679
And Jesse...

11:31.913 --> 11:34.881
Jesse wasn't supposed to be found dead.

11:34.916 --> 11:36.950
You two were really close, right?

11:36.985 --> 11:39.595
I wanted to shake him, you know.

11:41.889 --> 11:44.341
Look what the world's offering.

11:46.058 --> 11:50.007
This is hockey not Hollywood.

11:50.031 --> 11:53.045
Put on the make-up in
15 years, and I'll...

11:53.434 --> 11:55.512
I'll be the first to
say, hey kid, you...

11:55.537 --> 11:57.771
you look dynamite in a tube top.

11:57.805 --> 12:00.540
Must have been hard to
watch him throw it all away.

12:00.575 --> 12:03.477
Yeah. He, he was coming around.

12:03.511 --> 12:05.723
Tom, I gotta ask,

12:06.135 --> 12:08.870
were you home the night he went missing?

12:11.332 --> 12:13.053
Yeah.

12:13.087 --> 12:14.721
Was Jackie there?

12:14.756 --> 12:17.586
Listen. I know you're
just doing your job.

12:18.329 --> 12:21.047
But find the asshole who did this.

12:35.510 --> 12:36.943
I can't believe you told on me.

12:36.978 --> 12:39.179
I thought you were cool, Uncle Peter.

12:39.712 --> 12:41.433
Yeah? Well...

12:41.683 --> 12:44.464
I thought you were
sensible, pipsqueak Ryder.

12:44.489 --> 12:46.486
I hate it when you call me that.

12:46.521 --> 12:48.308
Yeah. Well, in prison,
you don't get to uh,

12:48.333 --> 12:50.401
choose your own nickname.
So I'm just warming you up.

12:50.426 --> 12:53.046
Hello. In here.

12:54.529 --> 12:57.880
So the little criminal decided
to break into the Driver house

12:57.905 --> 12:59.733
and conjure up dead Sandy.

12:59.767 --> 13:02.069
And Mr. Driver scared
the piss out of her.

13:02.103 --> 13:03.637
Why would you do that?

13:03.671 --> 13:06.206
In case she could help find Jesse.

13:09.711 --> 13:11.845
Why are you bleeding?

13:11.879 --> 13:14.323
Turns out you need blood for a séance.

13:15.942 --> 13:17.573
You gonna be good?

13:17.598 --> 13:18.920
Good.

13:19.312 --> 13:20.479
Love ya.

13:20.504 --> 13:22.171
Don't move.

13:22.752 --> 13:24.925
You getting it from all angles, huh?

13:24.959 --> 13:26.727
This may sound stupid, but Maggie said

13:26.761 --> 13:28.495
that Jesse had a surrogate dad.

13:28.529 --> 13:29.930
The riddle:

13:29.955 --> 13:32.211
Joseph's not Jesus' real dad...

13:33.048 --> 13:34.530
Tom.

13:35.570 --> 13:36.670
What?

13:36.704 --> 13:38.105
He has a white truck and rage.

13:38.139 --> 13:39.773
I saw him screaming at his team.

13:39.807 --> 13:41.408
It's hockey. It's not ballet.

13:41.442 --> 13:43.192
Is that something your
coach would have done?

13:43.217 --> 13:45.371
My coach hit my dad when
he took me on a camping trip

13:45.396 --> 13:47.247
and I missed a game.

13:48.038 --> 13:49.939
Can we be careful here?

14:05.176 --> 14:06.943
We found Jesse.

14:08.151 --> 14:10.301
He wasn't alive.

14:15.734 --> 14:16.910
Why?

14:16.944 --> 14:19.546
Baby, people do terrible things.

14:20.273 --> 14:23.572
But not all people and not all the time.

14:28.222 --> 14:30.588
I thought you were more mature.

14:35.014 --> 14:37.223
I just told her about Jesse.

14:39.133 --> 14:41.826
Get your stuff ready for the sleepover.

14:42.203 --> 14:44.004
She just got brought home by the cops.

14:44.029 --> 14:45.887
I think she needs to be
with her friends right now.

14:45.912 --> 14:47.442
Do you not see what's going on here?

14:47.467 --> 14:49.276
She's worried and she's trying to help.

14:49.310 --> 14:50.710
Whatever possessed you to bring up

14:50.745 --> 14:52.145
your dad's suicide the other night...

14:52.180 --> 14:53.380
with all that's going on.

14:53.414 --> 14:55.882
She knows the difference
between me and my dad.

14:56.385 --> 14:58.854
- He was crazy.
- He didn't start out crazy.

14:58.879 --> 15:00.644
He started out obsessive.

15:00.789 --> 15:02.229
C'mon!

15:02.731 --> 15:03.730
I'll drive you.

15:03.755 --> 15:05.690
This doesn't mean you're not in trouble.

15:39.827 --> 15:42.095
You are my light.

15:42.129 --> 15:44.624
You are my light.

15:47.268 --> 15:49.194
Annie...

15:50.061 --> 15:53.640
I can see you. See you...

15:56.143 --> 15:57.923
That's all I'm saying.

15:59.082 --> 16:01.400
Yeah. Just a few days.

16:03.156 --> 16:04.356
Okay.

16:24.005 --> 16:25.772
Your office said I'd find you here.

16:25.806 --> 16:27.707
Please tell me you've got good news.

16:27.941 --> 16:30.175
I got brewery investors
threatening to pull out

16:30.200 --> 16:31.867
because they're worried
we're about to become famous

16:31.901 --> 16:33.950
for a hate killing.

16:34.747 --> 16:36.231
What?

16:36.606 --> 16:39.551
I'm upset about Jesse
too, but people need jobs.

16:39.576 --> 16:41.944
Lily, get in the truck.

16:56.092 --> 16:58.560
"If a hero falls from glory,

16:58.595 --> 17:01.130
"where can he relive it?"

17:02.265 --> 17:04.098
Go! Go! Go, Jesse!

17:04.123 --> 17:06.657
That's my boy! Get over here!

17:06.683 --> 17:08.384
Come on!

17:13.797 --> 17:16.397
"Hero. Father figure."

17:20.349 --> 17:23.820
Now you four are the
leaders of this team.

17:24.727 --> 17:28.590
Now we lost our best man,
so you need to step up.

17:28.625 --> 17:31.026
Man up! As a team.

17:31.060 --> 17:32.906
That means no rifts.

17:32.931 --> 17:34.805
Jacob get over here.

17:34.830 --> 17:36.107
Max.

17:41.671 --> 17:44.477
No ice, no padding,
away from Mom and Dad

17:44.502 --> 17:46.989
and your cushy coddled lives.

17:47.737 --> 17:49.854
You settle your problem like men.

17:49.879 --> 17:52.714
- Fight it out.
- This is stupid.

17:53.299 --> 17:54.948
Agh!

17:54.973 --> 17:57.395
That's it. Get it out.

17:58.825 --> 18:00.846
- That's it.
- I'm gonna kill you, man!

18:00.871 --> 18:02.405
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

18:02.430 --> 18:04.087
Did you feel that? Feel that?

18:04.112 --> 18:06.571
That kill or be killed primal shit?

18:06.596 --> 18:07.831
That's how Jesse played.

18:07.856 --> 18:09.898
That's how he played because he had to.

18:09.933 --> 18:12.067
Now you bring that shit to the ice,

18:12.101 --> 18:13.435
we'll be all right.

18:13.469 --> 18:15.604
Not mediocre, like all
these other assholes.

18:15.638 --> 18:17.639
We'll be fucking Gods.

18:18.353 --> 18:20.170
Get over here!

18:24.129 --> 18:26.848
_

18:27.684 --> 18:29.645
Oh, we have a visitor.

18:29.670 --> 18:32.339
Hey, you wanna tell me why your late?

18:34.591 --> 18:36.694
Jesse! I'm talking to you.

18:36.719 --> 18:40.271
Hey! Jesse! I'm talking to you.

18:40.296 --> 18:42.364
Stop behaving like a little girl!

18:42.398 --> 18:44.132
Don't touch me, man! Don't touch me!

18:44.157 --> 18:46.324
What the hell is this? You
ungrateful, little shit!

18:46.349 --> 18:47.606
Come on!

18:48.611 --> 18:51.212
You need to let this go, kid!

18:56.479 --> 18:57.613
Hello, this is Chief Peter Welland.

18:57.647 --> 19:00.349
Leave a message after the beep.

19:00.762 --> 19:04.770
I'm watching this
practice video... of Jesse.

19:05.388 --> 19:08.276
And Tom and Jesse were
so close, and then...

19:08.301 --> 19:10.460
a month ago it all changed.

20:23.499 --> 20:25.174
"Don't be scared."

20:40.067 --> 20:41.683
What are you doing here?

20:42.956 --> 20:44.519
There is a truck parked
in front of your house.

20:44.554 --> 20:46.027
Is that him?

20:46.052 --> 20:48.387
He didn't hurt me. He wouldn't.

20:50.188 --> 20:53.557
He thinks you have a bond,
right? Not you? Just him?

21:07.708 --> 21:10.051
Is that something your
hockey coach would do?

21:13.635 --> 21:16.088
Tom heard we were coming to fight.

21:17.553 --> 21:19.229
He stopped us.

21:21.724 --> 21:23.325
We could have killed each other.

21:23.359 --> 21:24.860
The scores been settled.

21:24.894 --> 21:26.624
We can move on.

21:32.033 --> 21:34.242
What is he a fucking ghost?

21:34.604 --> 21:36.905
Do you believe that?
With Tom and the kids?

21:36.939 --> 21:38.740
They all swore it.

21:38.775 --> 21:41.550
What's with the "Lord
of the Flies" blood shit?

21:42.284 --> 21:44.813
- He has an alibi, Annie.
- His wife!

21:45.136 --> 21:47.916
The riddle's a dad
hurting, betraying his son.

21:47.950 --> 21:50.552
Tom. Jesse's father
figure, has a white truck,

21:50.586 --> 21:52.521
is acting weird.

21:54.204 --> 21:55.705
Is the hero Jesse?

21:55.825 --> 21:57.526
It was 'til he questioned his gender.

21:57.560 --> 21:59.970
Or is Tom the hero who fell
from glory after his accident?

21:59.995 --> 22:02.110
And where does he find it
again? With his team winning.

22:02.135 --> 22:04.102
- He needs Jesse for that.
- Stop!

22:04.127 --> 22:05.634
We're not dragging a guy through the mud

22:05.659 --> 22:08.679
because some psycho made
a painting on a wall, okay?

22:08.704 --> 22:10.457
If Tom did anything,
we'll get him on evidence.

22:10.482 --> 22:11.807
I'm just throwing
stuff against the wall.

22:11.841 --> 22:13.889
I used to be able to do that with you.

22:13.914 --> 22:16.411
Oh my God, don't make this about you.

22:16.446 --> 22:20.182
A kid is dead in a town where
my job is to keep the peace.

22:20.216 --> 22:22.287
And I gotta live with that.

22:22.312 --> 22:24.820
And also I gotta rip apart the
lives of other people I know.

22:24.854 --> 22:26.369
But I guess you don't care about ripping

22:26.394 --> 22:27.393
into other people's lives. Is that it?

22:27.418 --> 22:28.580
Just because we live in a small town,

22:28.605 --> 22:30.041
doesn't mean we don't
try to solve a murder.

22:30.066 --> 22:32.572
Okay, Annie. Listen.
People do weird things.

22:32.597 --> 22:35.132
Suspicious things. Including you.

22:35.338 --> 22:38.276
A lunatic who claimed he
knew something about Jesse

22:38.301 --> 22:40.949
reached out to you and you lied.

22:40.974 --> 22:42.508
And that boy ended up dead.

22:42.533 --> 22:44.277
He died before I lied to you.

22:44.302 --> 22:47.852
And still you ended up making
choices, taking a gamble,

22:47.877 --> 22:49.261
because you thought you knew best.

22:49.286 --> 22:51.042
It's just selfish, ego shit.

22:51.067 --> 22:53.237
And it reminds me of another cop I knew

22:53.262 --> 22:55.970
who left a 7-year-old behind
because he couldn't solve a case.

22:55.995 --> 22:57.245
And what ended up
happening with that guy?

22:57.270 --> 22:58.620
He thought he knew best too.

22:58.645 --> 23:00.651
He ended up, ended up with
the, you know these delusions

23:00.676 --> 23:01.933
and a fucking bullet in his head!

23:01.958 --> 23:04.417
You need to shut the fuck up right now.

23:08.091 --> 23:09.909
Fuck!

23:19.492 --> 23:21.794
Every kid should have a dog. Go on.

23:21.819 --> 23:23.295
What are you doing?

23:23.329 --> 23:25.063
I'm just trying to fix it up.

23:26.007 --> 23:27.365
Jesse's dead.

23:27.400 --> 23:30.093
My dad sucked. And Peter yelled at me.

23:30.710 --> 23:33.529
I can't, I can't do
this right now, Annie.

23:33.554 --> 23:35.106
I'm worried about Daisy.

23:35.141 --> 23:37.475
A séance? A break in?

23:37.843 --> 23:39.101
She worships you,

23:39.126 --> 23:41.054
and I will love you till
the day I fuckin' die,

23:41.079 --> 23:43.804
but I do not want my
daughter to end up like you.

23:45.351 --> 23:48.086
Why? Are you worried some older creep

23:48.120 --> 23:50.355
is gonna see her messed-upness,

23:50.389 --> 23:52.670
take advantage of her
and have sex with her?

23:55.261 --> 23:56.653
Okay. I was shitty.

23:56.678 --> 23:58.512
I had teen hormones.
They got the better of me.

23:58.537 --> 24:00.098
I don't want her to become me either.

24:00.132 --> 24:01.568
I just wanna take care of my kid.

24:01.593 --> 24:04.116
We are taking care of our kid.

24:04.937 --> 24:06.147
What's going on with you?

24:06.172 --> 24:08.108
I don't think you should
call around here all hours.

24:08.133 --> 24:09.788
You park outside my house!

24:09.813 --> 24:11.796
That's because I can't face
going in but I wanna be near you.

24:11.821 --> 24:13.249
But you're right. I-I shouldn't.

24:13.274 --> 24:15.189
I-I-I need to keep a straight head.

24:15.214 --> 24:16.314
Yeah. I'm the one preventing you

24:16.339 --> 24:18.600
from keeping your head
straight. Not the pills.

24:19.299 --> 24:20.757
Let me take you home.

24:20.782 --> 24:23.150
I came here 'cause I
don't wanna be alone.

24:23.422 --> 24:24.889
I'm not going home.

24:24.914 --> 24:27.257
- Don't do this, Annie.
- Do what?

24:27.282 --> 24:29.792
You fucking know what! Start shit!

24:29.817 --> 24:32.194
Get the fuck off me!

24:55.462 --> 24:57.355
Are you my nighttime stalker?

24:57.390 --> 24:59.057
Yeah.

24:59.332 --> 25:02.368
- You write me little notes?
- Yeah.

25:02.929 --> 25:04.763
Do you even know how to write?

25:13.339 --> 25:14.801
Hey man.

25:16.026 --> 25:17.582
Ugh!

25:18.527 --> 25:20.473
This woman brings out the worst in me.

25:20.498 --> 25:22.981
So I'd back the fuck off if I were you.

25:33.503 --> 25:36.361
I'm sorry. I'm so so sorry.

25:38.264 --> 25:40.989
One day you're gonna get yourself
in a shit-load of trouble.

26:12.905 --> 26:14.672
Are you okay?

26:16.497 --> 26:18.097
Yeah.

26:30.583 --> 26:34.107
Is that the closest payphone to
the gas station down the road?

26:34.587 --> 26:36.108
I guess so.

26:39.232 --> 26:41.100
Just a sec.

26:51.387 --> 26:53.082
Jesse used this phone.

27:09.836 --> 27:12.672
We need to pull payphone
records from the Rattlesnake.

27:12.836 --> 27:14.592
There's a payphone at the Rattlesnake?

27:14.627 --> 27:16.196
It's around the back.

27:16.221 --> 27:19.030
It's a hundred years old. I
didn't know it was here either.

27:19.064 --> 27:20.384
Let's check it out.

27:20.409 --> 27:22.078
Hey, I called some dads.

27:22.103 --> 27:24.569
Looks like Tom got the
boys to fight bare fisted,

27:24.603 --> 27:26.671
- for the team.
- Jesus.

27:27.033 --> 27:28.735
Hey, Annie...

27:30.795 --> 27:33.311
I'm sorry for the things I said earlier.

27:33.345 --> 27:34.812
Yep.

28:04.983 --> 28:07.645
You're here. The truck
comes around that corner.

28:07.680 --> 28:10.348
You see Jesse. What was his expression.

28:10.382 --> 28:12.975
Scared? Relaxed?

28:13.792 --> 28:15.986
But he was the truck when you
were supposed to be meeting.

28:16.011 --> 28:17.522
Isn't that weird?

28:17.556 --> 28:19.394
I thought that...

28:21.089 --> 28:23.394
he got cold feet.

28:23.429 --> 28:25.530
Jesse was like amazing.

28:26.003 --> 28:28.499
But I didn't always know what he wanted.

28:28.534 --> 28:31.226
Did anyone else know about
your plan to get out of town?

28:31.835 --> 28:33.406
You sure?

28:33.431 --> 28:35.710
- It's important.
- Is it?

28:35.874 --> 28:38.376
Jesse got beat up by
a bunch of white jocks,

28:38.410 --> 28:40.593
who aren't even in trouble!

28:42.648 --> 28:44.082
Where were you planning to go?

28:44.116 --> 28:46.150
We were gonna get on his bike

28:46.185 --> 28:47.752
and ride 'til no one looked at us funny.

28:47.786 --> 28:49.487
You were going to bicycle out of town?

28:49.521 --> 28:50.939
His motorbike.

28:50.964 --> 28:52.523
Jesse didn't have a motorbike.

28:52.558 --> 28:53.936
He bought one.

28:53.961 --> 28:56.794
He didn't have a job. Did he steal it?

28:59.365 --> 29:02.133
There's a crew of Rez
teens that ride motorbikes

29:02.167 --> 29:05.652
They had a bike and some
cash stolen last month.

29:05.933 --> 29:09.407
There's been word of
retaliation for whoever did it.

29:09.441 --> 29:11.785
I'm gonna check this out on the Rez.

29:18.150 --> 29:20.255
He ever talk about his coach?

29:20.280 --> 29:22.215
Seemed like he was Jesse's hero

29:22.240 --> 29:25.676
and then a month ago it all changed.

29:30.983 --> 29:33.898
They went to a motel in Red Bear Lake.

29:33.932 --> 29:36.534
Jesse told me he was
supposed to meet some scout...

29:37.870 --> 29:40.945
but whatever happened...
Jesse hated Tom after.

29:45.244 --> 29:47.679
Oh, I-I meant to... I just haven't.

29:47.713 --> 29:49.914
We had the wildest party.

29:49.948 --> 29:53.007
Tom still has NHL friends.
He was drafted first round.

29:53.032 --> 29:55.400
Anyway, they visit, things get crazy.

29:55.688 --> 29:57.397
Does Tom party a lot?

29:58.103 --> 29:59.429
No.

29:59.741 --> 30:02.191
Does Tom ever stay out overnight?

30:02.363 --> 30:03.895
What does that have...

30:03.929 --> 30:07.534
Rumors about a motel in Red Bear Lake?

30:09.097 --> 30:12.244
I'd like to put the rumors to rest.

30:12.604 --> 30:16.814
Gotta be a good reason a man takes
a 16-year-old kid to a motel. Yeah?

30:24.883 --> 30:26.068
Do you know for sure he took Jesse,

30:26.093 --> 30:28.061
or you just know he went there?

30:28.121 --> 30:30.037
We know he took Jesse.

30:30.889 --> 30:33.780
With Tom in a position
of power over the boys.

30:40.217 --> 30:42.300
He wasn't sleeping with
Jesse. I know that for a fact.

30:42.334 --> 30:44.435
He, he used to see a
prostitute up there.

30:44.470 --> 30:46.256
For things I won't...

30:47.339 --> 30:49.334
I guess he's back at it.

30:49.420 --> 30:52.131
Was he home the night Jesse was killed?

30:54.613 --> 30:57.133
We don't exactly sleep in one bed.

31:08.330 --> 31:10.064
I need you to think
about this okay, Daniel.

31:10.099 --> 31:12.516
- I'm trying to think about this.
- Would you rather...

31:12.541 --> 31:15.103
... work at Bestbuy...

31:15.137 --> 31:18.955
or be the best buy?

31:18.980 --> 31:20.480
You need to consider these things.

31:20.505 --> 31:22.947
And what are we gonna do
when we get out of here.

31:22.972 --> 31:24.645
If these important questions are not,

31:24.680 --> 31:26.214
you know, on your mind?

31:28.417 --> 31:30.785
You swear I don't get in
trouble if I tell you stuff?

31:30.819 --> 31:32.453
Not if you tell me the truth.

31:32.488 --> 31:34.288
Tom comes here.

31:34.323 --> 31:37.391
Last time he brought
that kid... who died.

31:38.016 --> 31:40.461
I come in, they barely notice

31:40.496 --> 31:42.630
'cause they're so into each other.

31:48.504 --> 31:50.315
We're gonna win it this year.

31:50.340 --> 31:52.273
Sure there's stuff we gotta
work out with the boys.

31:52.307 --> 31:55.143
But they don't see what's going on.

31:55.177 --> 31:58.446
You know, the-the pressure
messing up with your head.

31:58.598 --> 32:02.216
I know you, more than you know yourself.

32:02.251 --> 32:04.793
- You trust me?
- Yeah.

32:07.178 --> 32:09.037
Who's room is this?

32:10.225 --> 32:12.794
Oh... um... a friends.

32:14.430 --> 32:16.350
There she is.

32:17.599 --> 32:19.767
Come on over. What did I tell you, huh?

32:19.802 --> 32:22.342
Should see the girls after this kid.

32:28.343 --> 32:30.278
Let's start with these.

32:31.613 --> 32:33.414
All right. Stand up.

32:34.290 --> 32:38.196
He needs a taste and
a little confidence.

32:38.221 --> 32:39.739
Man up.

32:46.495 --> 32:48.830
Now you take care of my boy, all right?

32:58.874 --> 33:00.343
Oh-oh.

33:01.810 --> 33:03.530
I'm fine.

33:11.153 --> 33:13.899
I'm just so...

33:15.250 --> 33:17.414
fucking...

33:17.846 --> 33:19.446
tired.

33:21.540 --> 33:23.043
Me too.

33:24.377 --> 33:26.011
He thought we had sex.

33:26.036 --> 33:28.003
I knew you were all man.

33:28.028 --> 33:30.805
Who you are on the ice, man. That's you.

33:30.839 --> 33:32.254
That's you.

33:32.279 --> 33:34.781
We're going all the way
to the NHL. All the way.

33:36.493 --> 33:38.568
And you believe this woman?

33:39.662 --> 33:41.749
But how does that mean
that he killed Jesse?

33:41.783 --> 33:44.685
Goes back to Tom being a hero.

33:44.936 --> 33:47.255
Gets hit by a car, it all goes away.

33:47.289 --> 33:48.689
He spends years seeing a hooker

33:48.724 --> 33:51.205
he regales with hockey
stories to relive glory.

33:51.230 --> 33:53.963
Yeah, but it still doesn't
put him with Jesse that night.

33:54.329 --> 33:56.531
Explains him going nuts with the boys.

33:56.565 --> 33:58.499
He's desperate not to fade away.

33:58.534 --> 34:01.369
And we know he wasn't home.
Jackie basically admitted that

34:01.403 --> 34:03.237
when she said, "they 'don't
sleep in the same bed."

34:03.272 --> 34:05.840
Well, until she actually does
it's nothing though, right?

34:05.874 --> 34:07.478
Where's Brady and Virginia?

34:07.503 --> 34:10.407
At Maggie's. They're still working
on the motorcycle/money angle.

34:10.431 --> 34:13.683
But we're thinking something
spontaneous happened in the truck.

34:13.708 --> 34:15.616
That's not gang retaliation.

34:15.650 --> 34:18.286
Tom's got feelings, motives

34:18.320 --> 34:20.655
buried so deep, even from himself.

34:21.098 --> 34:23.902
If Jesse said something that
shamed him, he could snap.

34:32.632 --> 34:34.335
Tom got a call from the
Rattlesnake that night,

34:34.369 --> 34:36.737
12:15AM. It was a three minute call.

34:37.839 --> 34:39.250
Hey!

34:39.400 --> 34:40.804
Tread lightly.

34:41.502 --> 34:43.103
You got a phone call from a payphone

34:43.128 --> 34:45.496
at the Rattlesnake at 12:15 AM

34:45.521 --> 34:47.746
the same night that Jesse was killed.

34:48.483 --> 34:51.918
He was seen in a white
truck at 1:30 nearby.

34:51.954 --> 34:53.581
Yeah. He called.

34:54.389 --> 34:56.114
Wanted me to pick him up.

34:56.139 --> 34:57.592
But I didn't go.

34:57.626 --> 34:59.860
Jackie says I care more
about him than my girls.

34:59.895 --> 35:03.397
I had to draw boundaries...
picking him up at 1:30?

35:03.432 --> 35:05.236
Man, my marriage is in trouble.

35:05.261 --> 35:06.801
So why didn't you say anything?

35:06.835 --> 35:08.436
Because I was ashamed.

35:08.470 --> 35:11.839
A month ago your relationship
with Jesse did a 180.

35:12.327 --> 35:15.710
I guess that's when I told
him about needing boundaries.

35:15.970 --> 35:19.392
Claire, the prostitute you took
him to, paints a different picture.

35:19.548 --> 35:22.350
We can put you two at
Red Bear Lake Motel.

35:23.443 --> 35:24.793
Yeah.

35:24.818 --> 35:27.033
We were supposed to
meet up with a scout.

35:27.058 --> 35:28.863
It fell through.

35:28.888 --> 35:30.458
I did everything for him.

35:30.492 --> 35:32.572
Paid for skates, brought him to camps...

35:32.597 --> 35:34.397
Everything hockey.

35:34.422 --> 35:36.228
Maybe hockey wasn't everything to Jesse.

35:36.253 --> 35:38.799
He would've regretted giving it up.

35:39.337 --> 35:42.783
You know, I'm gonna blow your
mind here, but men are faking it.

35:42.938 --> 35:44.505
Living mediocre lives,

35:44.539 --> 35:47.308
pr-pretending to love changing diapers.

35:47.333 --> 35:50.344
We were chemically made
for a different world.

35:50.379 --> 35:53.279
Where, where we put on armor
or, or, or club mammoths.

35:53.304 --> 35:55.406
And hockey gives us that.

35:57.077 --> 36:00.079
And the camaraderie with the guys...

36:02.017 --> 36:03.557
I wanted him to have that.

36:03.592 --> 36:04.992
So you never took him to a hooker?

36:05.027 --> 36:07.103
Is that what you're trying to say here?

36:07.128 --> 36:09.596
Even if I did and-and I didn't...

36:09.621 --> 36:12.273
that, that was like a month
ago we went to that motel.

36:12.298 --> 36:13.447
How does it mean I killed him?

36:13.472 --> 36:15.160
It goes to how far you'd go to make sure

36:15.185 --> 36:17.738
the kid you invested in, created,

36:18.481 --> 36:20.207
turned into a hero
you could live through.

36:21.491 --> 36:23.912
What happened to you, your accident,

36:23.987 --> 36:25.174
it's unfair.

36:25.199 --> 36:26.881
But through Jesse, you
get a taste of the life

36:26.915 --> 36:28.616
you were supposed to have.

36:28.641 --> 36:31.544
And then he calls you wants
a ride to his boyfriend.

36:31.569 --> 36:33.546
Your ticket leaving town.

36:33.588 --> 36:35.790
It's hard to believe you
wouldn't try to bring him home.

36:35.929 --> 36:37.825
She in charge now? Huh?

36:39.987 --> 36:42.428
Word's gonna get around how
you're running this, Pete.

36:42.453 --> 36:44.320
Oh, how's your temper?

36:44.700 --> 36:47.401
By the way, I remember this junior game,

36:47.436 --> 36:49.403
guy slew footed him.

36:49.825 --> 36:52.075
His fucking dad had to come down
to the ice to pull him off the guy.

36:52.100 --> 36:54.395
I mean, he totally snapped. Just wacky.

36:54.420 --> 36:56.920
Can't imagine the rage
after all your sacrifices

36:56.945 --> 37:00.004
and Jesse says "I'm done. Out.

37:00.029 --> 37:01.586
"It's my life".

37:02.584 --> 37:04.624
'Cause it's your life too.

37:05.487 --> 37:07.388
Without him you go
back to barely existing.

37:07.422 --> 37:09.690
Of course you reacted.

37:09.725 --> 37:11.759
Yeah. He called you
on it, too, didn't he?

37:11.793 --> 37:14.982
Eh? He said, man you
are fucking pathetic.

37:15.007 --> 37:17.765
You're gonna try to live
your life through me?

37:17.799 --> 37:19.667
So you had a bit of an accident.

37:19.701 --> 37:21.035
It makes sense.

37:21.069 --> 37:23.003
You had a heat of the moment reaction.

37:23.038 --> 37:25.334
I was at home the
night Jesse was killed.

37:26.475 --> 37:28.843
Well, Annie, who spoke with your wife,

37:28.877 --> 37:31.460
is not so certain about that, Tom.

37:31.858 --> 37:34.226
You sure you don't wanna
get out in front of this?

37:34.251 --> 37:36.927
Well, Jackie's happy to clear
up any misunderstandings.

37:36.952 --> 37:38.851
She's right outside.

37:45.640 --> 37:48.638
Maggie says Jesse never
had a motorbike or cash.

37:49.564 --> 37:51.161
Holy shit.

37:51.655 --> 37:53.364
Not cash.

37:56.705 --> 37:58.072
You'll know it's ready the pieces

37:58.106 --> 38:00.007
don't stick together anymore.

38:00.041 --> 38:01.557
And that's the gist

38:01.582 --> 38:03.410
of dehydrating food.

38:04.814 --> 38:06.480
Am I boring you?

38:06.995 --> 38:08.949
No. No I'm sorry.

38:08.984 --> 38:11.118
No, I like it.

38:11.792 --> 38:14.059
So can you do it with any fruit?

38:15.090 --> 38:16.757
It's Eddie, leave a message.

38:18.126 --> 38:20.594
Half a pound of MDMA
found in Jesse's closet.

38:20.629 --> 38:22.880
Looks like Jesse was involved
in some sort of distribution.

38:22.905 --> 38:24.999
- Is this about the Rez teens?
- Nope.

38:25.033 --> 38:26.734
It's Rainmaker Jed's trademark

38:26.768 --> 38:28.035
says it's his spirit animal.

38:28.069 --> 38:29.703
So grossly appropriating a culture

38:29.738 --> 38:31.806
one knows nothing about
would normally piss me off.

38:31.840 --> 38:35.042
- But no today.
- Nobody goes to the Rez

38:35.075 --> 38:37.334
until we arrange it with the
Chief and we get a warrant.

38:37.359 --> 38:39.867
Might make some time but
we'll get it. Okay. Go.

38:45.296 --> 38:46.854
Jesse called Tom.

38:46.888 --> 38:48.898
Yes, and then Jackie came in here

38:48.923 --> 38:50.765
saying that you riled her
up with this hooker stuff

38:50.790 --> 38:52.551
so she lied because
she was pissed at him.

38:52.576 --> 38:54.410
Which you shoulda been able to read.

38:57.285 --> 38:59.133
He pays cash for the rooms.

38:59.167 --> 39:01.068
We've got nothing if you
don't give a statement.

39:01.102 --> 39:03.571
You said I didn't have
to do anything official.

39:03.662 --> 39:05.271
It's why I talked to you.

39:06.412 --> 39:08.248
He works with kids.

39:08.709 --> 39:11.045
People need to know
what kind of man he is.

39:11.079 --> 39:13.581
Find someone else then. You swore.

39:13.615 --> 39:16.517
Besides, you can't
put him in a worse jail

39:16.551 --> 39:18.185
than he's already in.

39:18.220 --> 39:21.045
How much you gotta hate
yourself to walk into traffic.

39:21.070 --> 39:24.058
I have sex for money
and got more self worth.

39:24.092 --> 39:26.420
What do you mean walk into traffic?

39:26.553 --> 39:28.577
Something he said once.

39:28.602 --> 39:30.217
He's messed up.

39:30.966 --> 39:33.500
The sign they made when he got drafted:

39:33.535 --> 39:36.537
"Welcome to Bellevue,
home of Tom Edmonds"...

39:36.571 --> 39:39.314
he still has it in the arena basement.

39:39.339 --> 39:41.251
Said the boys like to see it.

39:41.276 --> 39:43.744
Do they? Really?

39:52.854 --> 39:56.751
"If a hero falls from glory,
where can he relive it?"

39:57.125 --> 39:58.859
In a basement.

40:01.297 --> 40:04.165
So Tom gets hit by a van on purpose?

40:04.200 --> 40:06.609
Throws away a career,

40:06.634 --> 40:08.203
risks his life,

40:08.237 --> 40:10.205
days after Sandy's killed.

40:10.239 --> 40:12.655
Did anyone look at him for Sandy?

40:12.834 --> 40:16.028
We can't just ignore the riddler saying,

40:16.053 --> 40:18.645
there is a connection
between these cases.

40:18.670 --> 40:21.161
Look. One is a body in a pond, Annie.

40:21.186 --> 40:23.952
And the other one is
ritualistic psycho stuff.

40:23.986 --> 40:26.219
I'm not saying it's the same killer.

40:26.244 --> 40:28.087
I'm just saying...

40:28.519 --> 40:29.758
there's some connection.

40:29.783 --> 40:31.068
And I'm saying, leave it!

40:31.093 --> 40:32.927
No one wants to go back there, Annie.

40:32.962 --> 40:35.565
You have to admit, it's fucked up...

40:43.487 --> 40:45.596
_

40:48.944 --> 40:50.731
He left me a photo.

40:51.981 --> 40:53.942
Tom was Joseph.

40:54.116 --> 40:56.684
- What?
- In the pageant.

40:56.719 --> 40:59.220
There's something the riddler connected

40:59.466 --> 41:02.157
Tom to Jesse via Joseph.

41:02.191 --> 41:04.195
Now he's showing me that...

41:04.651 --> 41:06.553
Tom was Joseph in the pageant.

41:06.578 --> 41:08.086
Sandy's pageant.

41:08.697 --> 41:09.898
Was he at the shack?

41:09.932 --> 41:11.299
I can't hear you.

41:11.333 --> 41:13.034
I can't hear you, Annie. Say it again.

41:13.069 --> 41:15.602
A photo. I found a photo.

41:16.344 --> 41:18.682
We need... test the shack for DNA,

41:18.707 --> 41:20.578
test it against Tom.

41:20.776 --> 41:22.210
The shack is burnt, Annie!

41:22.244 --> 41:23.644
- What?!
- It's a...

41:23.669 --> 41:26.074
- What?!
- The shack is burnt, Annie.

41:26.099 --> 41:27.715
You went there?!

41:27.750 --> 41:30.612
I said don't go there!
Why did you go there??

41:30.637 --> 41:31.933
I can't hear you.

41:31.958 --> 41:34.668
I can't make out what you're saying.

41:37.967 --> 41:39.131
Hey!

41:39.156 --> 41:40.891
Open the door!

41:43.654 --> 41:45.183
Open the door!

41:47.186 --> 41:49.904
Gasoline? Why?

41:49.939 --> 41:52.466
Because I told Peter about the shack?

41:52.491 --> 41:54.691
You can't expect me to just trust...

41:54.716 --> 41:57.712
Shit... please...

41:57.746 --> 41:59.781
But you can, can't you?

41:59.815 --> 42:01.149
You're taking a chance,
telling me things.

42:01.183 --> 42:02.577
All you want is trust.

42:02.602 --> 42:04.919
And instinctually I do trust you.

42:05.194 --> 42:06.688
But you went away and I grew up.

42:06.722 --> 42:08.990
And I lost myself. And
maybe trusting you again

42:09.024 --> 42:11.259
is the first step to
finding myself again...

42:12.928 --> 42:16.559
Don't trust the guy
with fire in his eyes.

42:45.361 --> 42:47.162
Fire at Chief Peter Welland's.

42:52.792 --> 42:54.693
Goddamn kids...
