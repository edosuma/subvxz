01:18.500 --> 01:20.791
[Klaus] We have to keep going, Sunny.
I'm tired, too,

01:20.875 --> 01:23.333
but we have to find Violet
before it's too late.

01:23.416 --> 01:26.250
Do you think it's true
one of our parents survived the fire?

01:27.958 --> 01:31.041
It is difficult to describe
how Klaus and Sunny felt,

01:31.125 --> 01:33.708
hiding in the mail delivery vents
at Heimlich Hospital.

01:33.791 --> 01:36.833
So, allow me to explain it
by describing something

01:36.916 --> 01:40.125
that happened
to my good friend, Mr. Sirin.

01:41.958 --> 01:45.000
Mr. Sirin was a lepidopterist,
a word which usually means

01:45.083 --> 01:46.791
a person who studies butterflies.

01:46.875 --> 01:48.541
In Mr. Sirin's case, it also meant

01:48.625 --> 01:51.458
one who is being pursued
by government officials.

01:51.541 --> 01:52.875
-[knocking]
-[man] Open up.

01:52.958 --> 01:54.416
We're here for your butterflies.

01:55.583 --> 01:56.583
Quickly. Quickly.

01:56.666 --> 01:58.083
As the secret police closed in,

01:58.166 --> 02:01.291
Mr. Sirin opened his mouth
as wide as he could

02:01.375 --> 02:05.375
and swallowed every last butterfly,
alive and whole.

02:06.791 --> 02:08.916
Mr. Sirin was captured,

02:09.000 --> 02:12.875
but his butterflies were safe
from government questioning.

02:13.875 --> 02:16.375
You see? There's your problem right there.

02:16.458 --> 02:18.000
It is in his memory that,

02:18.083 --> 02:20.791
when a situation is
particularly fraught or tense,

02:20.875 --> 02:24.166
a person is said to have
butterflies in their stomach.

02:24.958 --> 02:27.833
Having butterflies in one's stomach
is not a pleasant feeling,

02:27.916 --> 02:31.125
but it is the best way to describe
how Klaus and Sunny felt,

02:31.208 --> 02:35.833
hiding in the vents at a hostile hospital,
watching Count Olaf and Esmé Squalor

02:35.916 --> 02:38.666
drag their sister toward perils unknown.

02:38.750 --> 02:41.208
[as Olaf] My diagnosis is
you've been captured.

02:41.291 --> 02:43.208
In my medical opinion, it all has to go.

03:38.666 --> 03:40.958
I have nothing to do with party planning.

03:41.041 --> 03:45.083
Please be aware that
two of the three Baudelaire murderers

03:45.166 --> 03:47.583
have been spotted in the hospital.

If you see any children whom you recognize

You really do tie a beautiful bow, Esmé.

Ding, ding, ding.

04:45.833 --> 04:48.041

I should have known better

04:48.125 --> 04:51.333
than to circumvent bureaucracy
for a handsome stranger.

Easy, sister.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.125
I'm not done with you, Babs.

04:54.208 --> 04:57.416
You helped me capture Violet,
and now you're going to help me hide her.

04:57.500 --> 05:02.333
Ha! You couldn't hide a binder clip here.
The paperwork keeps track of everything

05:02.416 --> 05:03.916

05:04.000 --> 05:05.458

05:05.541 --> 05:09.000
Anybody in this hospital would stick out
like a sore thumb

05:09.083 --> 05:10.833

on today's patient list,

05:10.916 --> 05:13.166
which is a complete list of
all the patients here.

05:13.250 --> 05:15.333
Then I'll just take your clipboard.

05:15.416 --> 05:16.625
What? No.

Anything but my clipboard.

05:22.708 --> 05:25.583
It's elementary.
If we devise a fake name for Violet,

05:25.666 --> 05:27.458
we can hide her amongst the patients,

05:27.541 --> 05:30.083
so her siblings
won't be able to find her...

05:30.166 --> 05:33.750

11:57.458 --> 11:59.666
First, file the release papers
in quadruplicate,

11:59.750 --> 12:01.416
and then those have to be authorized.

12:01.500 --> 12:04.208
Is there a way out
of here that doesn't involve paperwork?

12:04.291 --> 12:06.583
You can die. [laughs]

12:07.208 --> 12:09.750
Or you can take a left at the next hall.
The exit's that way.

12:10.375 --> 12:11.791
[door closes]

12:11.875 --> 12:13.250
There's someone coming.

12:19.333 --> 12:21.958
If we disguise ourselves,
we can roam around freely.

12:22.041 --> 12:22.875
What Klaus would do.

12:22.958 --> 12:25.500
Are you suggesting we pretend
to have medical degrees

12:25.583 --> 12:27.875
that we don't actually have?
[laughing nervously]

12:27.958 --> 12:28.875
You have to be quiet.

12:28.958 --> 12:30.583
Sorry, I'm just so nervous.

12:30.666 --> 12:31.708
You're calling attention.

12:31.791 --> 12:34.208
Let me sleep. I'm on a break.

12:34.291 --> 12:35.833
I've never faked anything in my life!

12:35.916 --> 12:40.041
The very thought is preposterous.
It's unthinkable. It's exhilarating.

12:40.125 --> 12:41.541
Yes! Let's do it!

12:41.625 --> 12:43.083
Put on this coat. Just be quiet.

12:43.166 --> 12:45.000
By gum, I want to live!

12:45.083 --> 12:46.958
[Mattathias] Well, that's a shame.

12:47.875 --> 12:51.041
We don't always get what we want.

12:52.750 --> 12:54.916
[laughs nervously]

12:57.958 --> 13:01.875
-Still think you can outsmart me?
-What have you done with Babs?

13:01.958 --> 13:04.833
You were such a bad influence on her,
we had to separate you two.

13:04.916 --> 13:09.500
But that's all right. We will fix
your delinquent behavior once and for all.

13:09.583 --> 13:10.458
Surgically.

13:11.125 --> 13:13.125
We found the anesthesia machine.

13:13.208 --> 13:15.125
This makes me see colored bubbles.

13:16.041 --> 13:17.541
Now, shh.

13:17.625 --> 13:18.958
Just relax...

13:19.041 --> 13:20.416
[breathing heavily]

13:20.500 --> 13:22.541
-and count backward from ten.
-[lullaby playing]

13:24.375 --> 13:25.583
What are you gonna do to me?

13:25.666 --> 13:27.250
Shh.

13:49.625 --> 13:52.375
Maybe we can get them
to give us a look at it.

13:52.458 --> 13:54.041

13:54.125 --> 13:56.416
[in deep voice] You, you, you.

13:57.916 --> 13:59.083
Yes, you.

13:59.166 --> 14:03.125
I have misplaced my patient list.
I was wondering if I could have yours.

14:03.208 --> 14:05.833
Patient list?
But patient lists are precious.

14:05.916 --> 14:09.458
We get them every morning from...
Oh, hello, other doctor.

14:10.416 --> 14:11.333
[as Mattathias] Yes?

Perhaps you can help this first doctor

14:15.583 --> 14:17.166
How may I be of service?

14:17.250 --> 14:19.625
He lost his patient list,
so he can't find his patients.

14:19.708 --> 14:20.916
[Mattathias] Is that so?

14:22.291 --> 14:26.583
You look very familiar.
What is your name, Doctor?

14:26.666 --> 14:28.333
My name is Dr. Faustus.

14:29.375 --> 14:31.041
Dr. Faustus?

14:31.625 --> 14:34.666
-MD.
-You look terribly young to be a doctor.

14:34.750 --> 14:38.666
Where did you attend medical school,
Dr. Faustus?

14:39.583 --> 14:41.125
Uh, Oxford, obviously.

14:41.208 --> 14:45.083
Huh. "Oxford." [snickers] Sounds made-up.

14:45.166 --> 14:46.791
-[volunteers laugh]
-[as Klaus] It is not.

14:46.875 --> 14:50.000
[as Faustus] Dr. Medical School,
may I have a peek at your list?

14:50.083 --> 14:54.125
Why don't you follow me
back to my otherwise deserted office,

14:54.208 --> 14:55.583
and I'll make you a copy.

14:55.666 --> 14:58.208
-Looks like you could use the exercise.
-[Sunny coos]

14:59.500 --> 15:01.625
There's no time to lose.

15:01.708 --> 15:03.250
I have a patient in need of medicine.

15:04.333 --> 15:08.166
And you wouldn't want
all these witnesses to know

15:08.250 --> 15:13.000
you let a patient die on your watch now,
would you, Dr. Medical School?

15:13.083 --> 15:16.791
You both seem pretty legit, to be honest.
You're both wearing medical coats.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.291
Just a quick glance.

15:21.708 --> 15:24.583
There, I saved a life today.

Please hold the applause.

15:47.208 --> 15:48.625
Sunny, you are amazing.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.291
She's not here. How can we find her
if her name's not on the list?

16:10.375 --> 16:11.375
[babbles]

16:12.291 --> 16:16.291
Good thinking. Count Olaf often uses
a ridiculous fake name.

16:16.375 --> 16:20.250
Wait, that makes me think of something
Duncan wrote in his notes.

16:39.041 --> 16:39.916
Duncan wrote "Ana Gram."

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
I thought that was a name,
but it's a clue.

16:42.083 --> 16:43.458
An anagram is a word created

16:43.541 --> 16:45.375
by rearranging letters
in a different word,

16:45.458 --> 16:47.333
like that playwright Al Funcoot.

16:48.458 --> 16:51.083
If you rearrange the letters, you get...

16:52.291 --> 16:53.666
[babbles]

16:54.250 --> 16:55.500
"Yikes" is right.

16:55.583 --> 16:57.666
Olaf uses anagrams
when he wants to hide something,

16:57.750 --> 16:59.375
and, right now, he's hiding our sister.

16:59.458 --> 17:01.791
So, if we find the anagram,
we find Violet.

17:04.958 --> 17:05.958
[coughing]

17:14.708 --> 17:17.541
Excuse me, but I was visiting
that bird town on business

17:17.625 --> 17:19.083
when I came down with light-headedness.

17:19.166 --> 17:21.041
I'm afraid
I might have picked up swine flu.

17:21.125 --> 17:23.583
If you'd like to see a doctor,
fill out the paperwork.

17:23.666 --> 17:25.500
An institution after my own heart.

17:25.583 --> 17:29.541
This hospital once had the finest records
this side of the Mortmain Mountains.

17:29.625 --> 17:32.500
But that's gone now.
My life's work has been destroyed.

17:32.583 --> 17:35.041
That paperwork can never be re-filed.

17:35.625 --> 17:36.666
You could use a secretary.

17:36.750 --> 17:39.916
In my experience,
people who say they want to help you

17:40.000 --> 17:41.625
let you down the most.

17:41.708 --> 17:42.541
I know what you mean.

17:42.625 --> 17:44.958
My secretary disappeared
into the Hinterlands somewhere.

17:46.250 --> 17:49.250
[continues coughing]
Shall I just wait here?

17:50.541 --> 17:51.916
[sighs]

17:52.000 --> 17:53.625
I just love hospitals.

17:55.375 --> 17:56.583
I used to.

17:58.125 --> 18:00.416
This is taking too long.
There's too many names.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.541
You're right, we can eliminate
any name without a "v."

18:05.625 --> 18:08.375
We know Violet Baudelaire has 16 letters.

18:08.458 --> 18:10.500
We must find her
before Olaf does something horrible.

18:10.583 --> 18:12.083
[as Olaf] Scalpel?

18:12.166 --> 18:13.041
Check.

18:13.125 --> 18:14.250
Bone saw?

18:14.333 --> 18:15.750
Check.

18:15.833 --> 18:17.583
Skull drill?

18:17.666 --> 18:19.125
[both] Check.

18:20.875 --> 18:21.833
It's time.

18:25.500 --> 18:28.666
Let's lose our first patient.

18:29.375 --> 18:30.708
Well, look at this name.

18:30.791 --> 18:33.583
Laura V. Bleediotie.
Rearrange the letters, and you get...

18:37.125 --> 18:38.833
It says she's in room 922.

18:43.750 --> 18:45.583
[sniffs] It smells like disinfectant.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.375
I know. I'm hungry, too.

18:55.166 --> 18:56.541
[Klaus] She's not here, Sunny.

18:56.625 --> 18:57.708
Who's not here...

18:59.041 --> 19:00.208
Doctor?

19:01.750 --> 19:05.250
[as Faustus] Do you know what happened
to the patient that was in this room?

19:05.333 --> 19:08.458
Do you mean the ugly little girl
with the big mouth?

19:08.541 --> 19:10.291
She's being prepped for surgery.

19:10.375 --> 19:13.666
-Surgery?
-Yes, so you're just in time.

19:13.750 --> 19:15.875
[Mattathias over PA] Paging Dr. Faustus.

19:15.958 --> 19:19.583
You are desperately needed
in the operating theater.

19:20.166 --> 19:22.708
In precisely five minutes, we will perform

19:22.791 --> 19:26.750
the world's first cranioectomy
on a teenage girl.

19:26.833 --> 19:31.125
[stammering] Well, "cranio" means head,
and "ectomy" means to remove something.

19:33.125 --> 19:37.333
You know very big words.
You must be a very good doctor.

19:37.916 --> 19:39.583
Let's find out how good.

19:39.666 --> 19:42.166
[Mattathias over PA] We all hope
this very dangerous operation

19:42.250 --> 19:43.500
is a complete success.

19:43.583 --> 19:46.291
But, as always, in the field of medicine,

19:46.875 --> 19:49.416
stuff happens.

19:51.541 --> 19:53.750
If you're wondering about
my enormous, terrifying knife,

19:53.833 --> 19:57.291
the answer is, yes, it's incredibly sharp.

19:57.375 --> 20:00.833
One swipe and... [imitates cutting sound]

20:13.791 --> 20:14.958
[elevator bell dings]

20:16.333 --> 20:17.208
Impressive.

20:17.291 --> 20:20.166
Butterflies in your stomach, Dr. Faustus?

20:20.250 --> 20:23.583
Don't worry. This is going to be fun.

20:31.666 --> 20:33.250
-Program?
-Program.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.791
Program.

20:34.875 --> 20:37.125
I can't believe
I got tickets to this operation.

20:37.208 --> 20:40.041
It sold out mere moments
after going on sale.

20:40.125 --> 20:42.458
-I hope it's a musical.
-I brought my opera glasses.

20:42.541 --> 20:45.916
They were an anniversary gift
from my wife. [coughing]

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
You ought to have someone take a look
at that cough, buddy.

20:49.083 --> 20:50.416
Cough?

20:50.500 --> 20:52.916
[hook-handed man]
The show is about to begin.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.833
Please find your places
and silence all mechanical devices.

21:05.791 --> 21:07.333
[Mattathias clears throat]

21:07.916 --> 21:12.375
Ah, Dr. Faustus,
I've been eagerly awaiting you.

21:13.666 --> 21:16.166
And so has
our little sleeping beauty here.

21:16.833 --> 21:21.500
Well, hurry along, Dr. Faustus.
The anesthesia won't last forever.

21:21.583 --> 21:25.125
Don't forget this. You'll need it.

21:27.458 --> 21:30.208
I do hope she doesn't wake up
in the middle of the operation.

21:34.250 --> 21:37.916
Doctors, nurses,
Volunteers Fighting Disease,

21:38.000 --> 21:40.166
gore fans, regular people,

21:40.250 --> 21:44.625
welcome to the operating theater
of Heimlich Hospital.

21:48.750 --> 21:54.166
I am Dr. Mattathias Medical School,
and these are my associates.

21:55.166 --> 21:56.375
Dr. Flacutono.

21:56.458 --> 21:57.291
Dr. Tocuna.

-Nurse Flo.
-Nurse Glo.

21:59.958 --> 22:05.208
And I am Nurse Cassandra Ursula
Terrific Elliandra--

22:05.291 --> 22:08.875
And, of course, the man
who will be performing the operation,

22:08.958 --> 22:12.500
the marvelous Dr. Faustus.

22:17.416 --> 22:18.916
As I'm sure you've heard,

22:19.000 --> 22:23.750
a cranioectomy is a procedure
in which the patient's head is removed.

22:24.333 --> 22:27.708
Scientists have discovered
that many health problems

22:27.791 --> 22:29.458
are rooted in the brainial area.

22:30.333 --> 22:35.250
So, the best thing to do for the patient
is remove the head altogether.

22:37.875 --> 22:42.291
Now, a cranioectomy is as dangerous
as it is necessary.

22:43.083 --> 22:48.208
There is a chance that the patient
may tragically die during the operation,

22:48.791 --> 22:51.750
leaving their enormous fortune
up for grabs.

22:53.000 --> 22:58.583
But sometimes we make sacrifices
in the name of advancement.

23:04.291 --> 23:06.750
Isn't that so, Dr. Faustus?

23:06.833 --> 23:08.500
[breathing heavily]

23:10.916 --> 23:12.375
[as Klaus] What do we do?

23:14.458 --> 23:16.083
[babbles]

23:16.166 --> 23:20.208
When you read books,
you are going to learn information

23:20.291 --> 23:22.541
that might not be useful for a long time.

23:22.625 --> 23:24.750
Then suddenly,
like a strike of lightning...

23:24.833 --> 23:25.708
[thunderclap]

23:25.791 --> 23:28.208
...or a grand piano
falling out of a window,

23:28.291 --> 23:31.208
an opportunity arises
to use the information

23:31.291 --> 23:34.416
gleaned from even
the most unlikely piece of reading.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.791
[piano crashes]

23:40.666 --> 23:42.625
[as Faustus] Before I make
the first incision,

23:42.708 --> 23:45.166
[stammers] I think
I should talk a little bit

23:45.250 --> 23:47.583
about the equipment I'm using.

23:47.666 --> 23:50.166
In the case of Klaus,
it was an obscure book

23:50.250 --> 23:54.583
from the Baudelaire library,
The Complete and Total History of Knives.

23:57.458 --> 23:58.541
This is a knife.

23:58.625 --> 24:03.666
We know it's a knife.
Now let's see you use it.

24:03.750 --> 24:05.708
Any real doctor
would never perform a procedure

24:05.791 --> 24:07.625
without explaining everything first.

24:07.708 --> 24:09.333
And we are both real doctors, aren't we?

24:09.416 --> 24:11.000
-[mouths inaudibly]
-[all murmur]

24:13.583 --> 24:16.125
Keep it short, Doctor.

24:17.333 --> 24:20.000
The knife is the oldest surgical tool
in the world.

24:20.458 --> 24:24.958
Early knives have been found
in Mayan tombs, Egyptian temples.

24:25.041 --> 24:26.375
[hisses]

24:27.208 --> 24:31.833
There are many different types of knife,
which I'm going to list for you now.

24:32.833 --> 24:34.708
-This is very interesting.
-[chuckles]

24:34.791 --> 24:38.250
There's the pen knife, the pocket knife,
the butter knife--

24:38.333 --> 24:40.708
What a lengthy explanation,

24:40.791 --> 24:43.916
but it's time for the main event.

24:45.125 --> 24:49.083
Yes, all these lovely people
will understand the process better

24:49.166 --> 24:51.416
once the head has been removed.

24:51.500 --> 24:52.666
Do it.
