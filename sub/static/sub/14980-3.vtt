00:21.772 --> 00:24.559
Looks like National Geographic
exploded on your desk.

00:24.650 --> 00:27.733
What expression do you see?
Quick, quick, quick, quick!

00:27.862 --> 00:29.477
Disgust.
Yep.

00:29.572 --> 00:33.360
The expression looks
the same on a Papua elder...

00:33.451 --> 00:36.614
or... a Hollywood starlet.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.749
Look at you in New Guinea.

00:40.833 --> 00:43.165
You reliving your
dissertation glory days?

00:47.089 --> 00:49.796
- What’s this?
- That’s a koteka.

00:49.884 --> 00:51.840
That’s hand-carved. It’s very rare.

00:51.928 --> 00:55.921
- What do they use it for? Soup?
- Genital presentation.

00:56.015 --> 01:01.555
Ift/Ie man was Dying to impress a woman,
he ’0’ serve h/mse/f up on that, so to speak.

01:01.646 --> 01:05.935
Dr. t/ghtman, Special Agent Dart/is
is here from the FBI.

01:06.067 --> 01:08.149
And I have your daughter
on line two.
Than/(s, Held/I

01:09.612 --> 01:11.318
[Beeps]
Hello, love.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.691
How’s it going at your mum’s?

01:13.783 --> 01:15.739
Okay, I guess. You know how Mom is.

01:15.826 --> 01:18.158
She needs to know everything
I’m doing every second.

01:18.246 --> 01:22.205
Bloody intrusive, isn’t it?
What are you doing this very second?

01:22.291 --> 01:24.532
- Dad—
- What?

01:24.669 --> 01:27.581
You still need a lift later?
Uh, n0.

01:27.672 --> 01:30.914
Um, actual/y,
I’ve got a [34gr chem test on Friday.

01:31.008 --> 01:34.000
|— I’m gonna sleep over
at Katie’s house?

01:37.640 --> 01:40.052
You sure about that?
Yeah.

01:43.479 --> 01:45.595
- All right. Love you.
- Love you too.

01:45.690 --> 01:48.022
[Beeps]
You heard that, right?

01:48.109 --> 01:52.068
Word repetition and vocal pitch went up
when she was talking about staying at Katie’s.

01:52.196 --> 01:54.812
I’m sure it was nothing.
What did you hear then?

01:54.907 --> 01:59.492
I heard a typical teenager in the process
of forming her self-identity.

02:00.997 --> 02:05.240
That’s psychobabble,
that is. She was lying.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.325
Emily needs to have her own secrets.

02:07.420 --> 02:09.411
That’s not the same thing as lying.

02:12.717 --> 02:16.255
Daniel/e Star/c, I 7 years old
sen/or at Str/l/ers Magnet School.

02:16.345 --> 02:20.884
She went missing a week ago.
Her body was found a day later
dumped in Rock Creek Park.

02:20.975 --> 02:24.092
She died from a blow to the head.

02:24.186 --> 02:26.313
But you’re not here
because ofthe girl, right?

02:26.397 --> 02:30.561
No. Her mother is a feo’era/juo’ge
on the D. C. circuit court.

02:30.651 --> 02:34.940
Judge Stark’s been short-listed
as a possible Supreme Court nominee.

02:35.031 --> 02:37.613
But we’re treating this case
just like any other.

02:37.742 --> 02:41.485
Was there any physical evidence?
Unfortunately,
it rained that night.

02:41.579 --> 02:44.537
The best we can do
is determine that the blow
came from the front,

02:44.623 --> 02:47.990
no defensive wounds,
indicating Danielle
likely knew her killer.

02:48.085 --> 02:52.624
The problem is with the mother.
She says that she was alone
in her chambers.

02:52.715 --> 02:55.331
And no one can verify it.

02:55.426 --> 02:57.417
So you’ve got a suspect, right?

02:59.430 --> 03:02.922
That’s great, since you’re treating
this casejust like any other.

03:03.017 --> 03:05.053
As you can imagine,
we need to proceed carefully...

03:05.144 --> 03:07.556
before we start pointing fingers
at a presidential appointee.

03:07.646 --> 03:10.388
But ifshe’s ly/ng, we need to know

03:10.483 --> 03:14.726
- And ifshe’s not?
- Then we need to know who is.

03:24.789 --> 03:28.657
Nice place.
Bit ofa mausoleum.

03:28.793 --> 03:30.875
...ask you a few questions.
Yes, that’s fine.

03:30.961 --> 03:35.204
Dr. Lightman, Ria Torres, this is
Danielle’s mother,Judge Kathleen Stark.

03:35.299 --> 03:39.087
Agent Dardis tells me that you may be able
to help catch the person who did this.

03:39.178 --> 03:41.294
Yeah.

03:41.389 --> 03:44.552
- What is that for?
- Wejust don’t wanna miss
anything that could help.

03:44.642 --> 03:49.352
-Hmm.
- So, what can you tell us
about Danielle?

03:49.438 --> 03:52.396
Well, I’ve already told
the FBI. everything.

03:52.483 --> 03:55.270
So, what more do you want to know?

03:55.361 --> 03:57.647
Um, tell us about,
uh, your happiest moment together.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.445
A family trip,
a birthday party, anything.

04:00.533 --> 04:02.444
[Sighs]

04:02.535 --> 04:05.493
I don’t understand the purpose ofthis.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.661
Okay. Um,

04:07.748 --> 04:10.865
how did you feel
when you found out she was dead?

04:13.754 --> 04:17.338
l, uh—

04:17.425 --> 04:19.837
I really can’t talk about it.

04:21.929 --> 04:24.762
It was the worst day of my life.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.717
Do you have children, Dr. Lightman?

04:31.480 --> 04:34.392
Yeah. I have a— a daughter.

04:34.483 --> 04:37.520
She’s a little younger than Danielle was.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.569
Then it shouldn’t be hard
for you to imagine howl felt.

04:40.656 --> 04:43.989
Was Danielle
having any trouble at home?

04:44.076 --> 04:46.408
Of course not.

04:46.495 --> 04:51.114
She was everything you
could hope for in a daughter.

04:51.208 --> 04:54.120
She was a straight-A student,
top of her class.

04:54.211 --> 04:56.418
She was so special.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.047
Please find out who did this to her.

05:02.636 --> 05:05.548
[ Ria ] It’s pretty strange
the way she talked about her daughter

05:05.639 --> 05:07.675
Straight-,4 student top of her class.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.973
Who cares about that
after they lose their child?

05:10.060 --> 05:11.971
Someone who’s obsessed with image.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.973
Perfect house, perfect kid.

05:14.064 --> 05:16.100
Perfect kids
don’t usually get murdered
by someone they know.

05:16.192 --> 05:18.148
Yeah, well, maybe Danielle
wasn’t so perfect.

05:18.235 --> 05:20.567
But it’s not Danielle
I’m concerned with.

05:22.364 --> 05:25.447
- [ Beeps, Whirring]
- She was always talking...

05:25.534 --> 05:29.493
about how important
her friends were to her.

05:29.580 --> 05:32.287
You know, she was an only child.

05:32.374 --> 05:34.330
And, uh,

05:34.418 --> 05:36.909
I think she used them to substitute.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.995
I’ve listened to a lot
of grieving mothers.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.296
And ifshe’s faking it,
she’s one ofthe best I’ve seen.

05:41.383 --> 05:44.090
She’s one ofthe best you’ve ever heard.

05:44.178 --> 05:46.965
Now, this was recorded in 7994.

05:47.056 --> 05:49.593
Day after Susan Smith’s
two children disappeared.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.594
[ Beeps, Whirring ]

05:51.685 --> 05:54.722

05:58.359 --> 06:00.270
[ Cal] Sounds grief stricken, r/ght?

06:00.361 --> 06:04.070
Itjust seems so unfair that somebody
could take such two beautiful children.

06:04.156 --> 06:07.193
[ C l/cks ]
[Cal] Right.

06:07.284 --> 06:09.661
She told the police
that she’d been carjacked.

06:09.745 --> 06:11.736
But later she admitted to the police...

06:11.830 --> 06:15.823
that she’d strapped her two children
into their car seats...

06:15.918 --> 06:17.909
and rolled them into the lake.

06:19.505 --> 06:22.372
Now watch it with the sound off.

06:22.466 --> 06:25.003
[ Typing, Beeps]

06:27.638 --> 06:31.802
Well, her lace doesn ’t match
the gr/ef of her words.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.804
Right? There’s no involvement
in the forehead.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.511
Nothing around the eyes.

06:37.606 --> 06:39.562
She could be reading from a grocery list.

06:39.692 --> 06:42.104
[No Audible Dialogue]
Now watch the judge again.

06:44.321 --> 06:47.813
[ Typing, Beeps]

06:47.908 --> 06:51.992
They look exactly the same.
The judge is showing nothing.

Oh, hey. Judge Stark has asked
for a brief mourning period.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.743
But she’ll be available
after tomorrow’s memorial service.

07:35.873 --> 07:38.660
Yeah. We need to be there.
We won’t be able to talk to her.

07:38.751 --> 07:41.117
Well, we don’t need to talk to her.
We need to watch.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.164
You going to the funeral?
I can’t.

07:43.255 --> 07:45.211
I’m meeting
with the deputy chief of NASA.

07:45.341 --> 07:48.754
One oftheir experimental jets crashed.
They think the pilot’s lying
about what happened.

07:48.844 --> 07:52.507
Oh, well, that’s not surprising since
the whole space program was based on lies.

07:52.598 --> 07:55.465
Some of their top scientists
were Nazis recruited after the war.

07:55.559 --> 07:57.845
They gave the world Tang.

07:57.936 --> 08:01.178
- Hey?
- Dr. Lightman? It’s Emily.

08:01.273 --> 08:04.936

/t wasn ’t even a party reallv.
/t was just a couple of friends.

08:17.915 --> 08:21.499
Cops said there were more
than a hundred kids at your
mum’s house while she was away.

08:21.585 --> 08:23.576
So you lied to me
about staying over at Katie’s.

08:23.712 --> 08:27.375
I said I was sorry.
How many more times can I say it?
As many times as you want.

08:27.466 --> 08:30.128
I can’t trust you to be on your own
when your mum’s away.

08:30.219 --> 08:33.052
So you’re gonna come here every day
after school until she gets back.

08:33.138 --> 08:36.301
No! What am I gonna do?

08:39.978 --> 08:42.435
You’re gonna organize this room.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.309

Nope

Long time no see.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.987
Hey, you look terrible, awful.

08:52.074 --> 08:54.360

- That was interesting.
- Okay, you wanna tell me
what that was about?

10:03.061 --> 10:06.599
There was still no action in the forehead
or around the eyes, even though she startled.

10:06.690 --> 10:10.023
- Okay?
- She’s definitely hiding something.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.439
Her age.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.521
She’s using Botox.

10:17.201 --> 10:21.069
No wonder I couldn’t
pick anything up.
It paralyzes the facial muscles.

10:21.163 --> 10:24.781
The tears were real, and her forehead
would show sadness if it could.

10:24.875 --> 10:28.538
Yeah, but she still doesn’t have an alibi
for the night ofthe murder.

10:28.629 --> 10:32.292
Chances are any mother who killed
her daughter would display shame.

10:32.382 --> 10:35.545
- Unless she was a sociopath.
- Ifthe mother’s not lying,
where does that leave us?

10:37.930 --> 10:40.797
FBI. says they think
that Danielle knew her killer.

10:40.891 --> 10:42.973
So it’s possible that person’s here.

10:43.101 --> 10:47.595
It’s pretty risky to show up
at the victim’s memorial.
Well, it’d be suspicious not to.

10:47.689 --> 10:50.271
Especially ifthey were close.

10:53.070 --> 10:56.062
[Man ] You’re looking at the X-48,
or what’s leﬁ‘ of it.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.147
I didn’t realize NASA
still did test flights.

10:58.242 --> 11:01.780
Shuttle program’s coming to a close.
We’re looking to the next generation.

11:01.870 --> 11:05.988
This was supposed to be it.
Now it’s $250 million
worth of scrap metal.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.324
Tell me about the pilot.

11:08.418 --> 11:11.205
Commander David Markov.
He’s had an exemplary career.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.287
Navy pilot, flight instructor.

11:13.382 --> 11:16.089
There ’5 nothing on his record suggests he
would’ve crashed the plane intentional/y.

11:16.218 --> 11:20.006
What makes you think he did?
Flight telemetry indicated
no systems malfunction.

11:20.097 --> 11:22.429
All of a sudden, Markov went
full throttle, flaps down.

11:22.516 --> 11:25.508
He ejected just before he dove
the plane straight into the ground.

11:25.602 --> 11:29.345
I don’t believe he wasjust
disoriented like he’s claiming.

11:29.481 --> 11:32.063
Did he have some sort
of issue with NASA?
No.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.061
But we have
to consider Markov’s father.

11:34.152 --> 11:37.644
He was a rocket engineer with the old
Soviet Space Agency. Defected in ’72.

11:37.739 --> 11:40.230
Russians are developing
their own scramjet technology.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.862
Russian spies.
Oh, what’s next?

11:42.953 --> 11:45.695
Duran Duran
and parachute pants?
’Cause |— I dug the ’805.

11:45.789 --> 11:49.782
It’s what we’ve got.
Commander Marko v won ’t admit an yth/ng.

11:49.877 --> 11:53.665
He’s suspended pending the outcome
ofyour investigation.

11:55.340 --> 11:58.548
I was at Angels Ten,
zone 5 afterburners, C.A.V.U....

11:58.635 --> 12:01.718

12:01.805 --> 12:04.387

at a cruising altitude of 10,000 feet.

12:11.982 --> 12:14.689

After that, itjust all went fuzzy.

12:22.284 --> 12:25.196
- You blacked out?
- No, ma’am. I was fully conscious.

12:25.287 --> 12:29.872
But I got disoriented, lost track oftime.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.540
Next thing I knew,
the aircraft was pointed at the ground.

12:32.628 --> 12:36.086
I managed to get
to the ejection handles and punch out.

12:36.173 --> 12:38.664
That’s howl ended up with this.

12:40.302 --> 12:44.420
Commander Markov,
your father came to this country in 1972?

25:29.654 --> 25:32.737
Yeah. And the slip ofthe tongue
when she was talking
about the pressure.

25:32.824 --> 25:35.440
- [Beeps]
- I mean, he’s been under
a lot of pressure lately,

25:35.576 --> 25:38.283
but I— he’s handled it
just fine.
[Clicks]

25:38.413 --> 25:40.620
So she’s been handling it.
But he hasn’t.

25:40.748 --> 25:44.457
VVhatsshe
hiding about him?
Oh, sex, drugs or money.

25:44.585 --> 25:47.998
The holy trinity.
Drugs could explain
the change in demeanor.

25:48.089 --> 25:50.626
Aren’t pilots drug tested by NASA
every couple of months?

25:50.717 --> 25:52.924
For illegal narcotics.
But drug tests are exclusive.

25:53.010 --> 25:55.046
You have to choose
what you wanna screen for.

25:55.138 --> 25:59.381
Maybe he went
on some kind ofantianxiety
medication a few weeks ago.

25:59.475 --> 26:02.217
And ifhe stopped taking it
right before the test ﬂight,

26:02.311 --> 26:05.144
withdrawal symptoms
can include suicidal impulses.

26:05.231 --> 26:08.644
- Exactly.
- I’ll call NASA.
Have them run a new tox panel.

26:15.783 --> 26:20.368
Oh, good job.
You got a future as a housekeeper.

26:20.455 --> 26:22.411
Yeah. Not bad, right?

26:22.498 --> 26:25.956
And you’ve got stuff in here
going back to the Dark Ages.

26:26.043 --> 26:28.659
[Sighs]
Okay.

26:28.755 --> 26:31.997
I’m sorry I lied.
I totally deserve the punishment.

26:33.676 --> 26:35.792
Apology accepted.

26:35.887 --> 26:40.256
But can you remember this next time you
decide to have a party behind my back?

26:40.349 --> 26:44.137
Oh, I’m not sorry about that,
just that I lied to you about it.

26:44.228 --> 26:46.435
I think you should
check out my networker page.

26:46.522 --> 26:48.899
I had 200 new friend requests
all because ofthat party.

26:48.983 --> 26:53.317
Hey! Since when do you care
about being so popular?

26:53.404 --> 26:56.692
You know what kind oftrouble
you can get into, a girl your age?

26:56.783 --> 26:59.399
Where’s that coming from?
Some case you’re working on?

27:00.536 --> 27:03.027
Oh, what do you care?

27:03.122 --> 27:05.238
What do you care about new friends...

27:05.333 --> 27:08.541
ifall they’re looking for
is a place to drink or to get high?

27:08.628 --> 27:11.165
You’re one to talk.

27:12.423 --> 27:14.755
What do you— What do you call this?

27:16.385 --> 27:18.512
Research.
Oh, please!

27:18.596 --> 27:22.589
Those are Berber nomads.
Completely cut off
from Western civilization.

27:22.725 --> 27:24.841
I had to gain their trust.
Come on.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.969
Talk aboutjoining the tribe.
It’s not
the same thing at all.

27:28.064 --> 27:30.271
And you know it.
Hey.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.859
F.B.I. found surveillance footage at
the courthouse where they can make her out.

27:35.947 --> 27:38.654
So she didn’t kill her daughter then, eh?

27:38.741 --> 27:41.699
No. But there ’5 something you should see.
Daniel/e ’5 academic transcr/pts.

27:41.786 --> 27:44.448
I’ll be right there.

27:45.748 --> 27:48.330
Conversation’s not over.

27:48.417 --> 27:50.408
[ Ria ]
Danielle’s GPA was excellent.

27:50.503 --> 27:52.368
But her SAT. scores
were barely average.

27:52.505 --> 27:55.918
She took the test twice, scoring
around the 65th percentile.
So?

27:56.008 --> 27:58.215
She knew she wasn’t gonna
make the top of her class.

27:58.302 --> 28:01.669
She signed up to take
the SAT. a third time.
Scorejust got posted this week.

28:01.764 --> 28:04.426
Oh! Ninety-fourth percentile.
That’s quite an improvement.

28:04.559 --> 28:07.016
I wonder
what she did differently.
I can tell you one thing.

28:07.103 --> 28:09.936
She got murdered the day
before she took that test.

28:22.410 --> 28:24.492
Why would someone else take the SAT.
for Danielle Stark...

28:24.579 --> 28:26.535
the day after she was murdered?

28:26.622 --> 28:30.786
D.C. Homicide kept the case quiet
for 24 hours because of who the family is.

28:34.964 --> 28:37.546
I got it.

28:37.633 --> 28:39.544
Whoa. Danielle’s name.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.717
But look at the photo.

28:41.804 --> 28:44.671
t ook familiar?

28:49.604 --> 28:52.596
I don’t know what this is. It must be
some kind of prank by one of my students.

28:52.690 --> 28:54.681
Danielle’s I.D. wasn’t stolen.

28:54.775 --> 28:56.857
I think she gave it to you.

28:57.987 --> 28:59.898
Why would she do that?

28:59.989 --> 29:02.776
- Well, so you could
take the test for her.
_ |_

29:03.993 --> 29:07.577
/do not have to listen to this!

29:07.663 --> 29:11.576
Whoo.l You might wanna try
that move again, love, rea/lv.

29:11.667 --> 29:14.704
- It was awful gestural timing.
- What does that mean?

29:14.795 --> 29:18.458
Well, she voiced outrage
and then she slammed her hand down.

29:18.549 --> 29:21.712
If she was truly outraged
it all would’ve happened
at the same t/me.

29:21.802 --> 29:24.384
Look, we have the essay section
of Danielle’s test.

29:24.472 --> 29:27.555
Ifyou took the test for her,
we’lljust match
the handwriting to yours.

29:35.566 --> 29:40.356
Do you have any idea how difficult it is
to get by on a teacher’s salary?

29:43.366 --> 29:47.860
How am / ever gonna pay off
a hundred grand in student loans?

29:47.954 --> 29:51.037
- Yeah, well, you got a point there.
- That sounds like motive to me.

29:51.123 --> 29:55.241
No, no! This is insane! I didn’t know
she was dead when I took the test.

29:55.336 --> 29:57.372
Why would I have taken it ifl killed her?

29:57.463 --> 30:00.250
Well, maybe she
threatened to expose you.
Things got out of hand

30:00.341 --> 30:04.801
- So you decided to build yourselfan alibi.
- No. Nothing got out of hand.

30:04.887 --> 30:08.345
- Wejust— We had an argument.
- About what?

30:09.809 --> 30:12.642
Danielle contacted me through e-mail.

30:12.728 --> 30:17.392
But she didn’t tell me
what score she wanted on the test.

30:17.483 --> 30:20.475
/ can hit an y percentile / want.

30:20.569 --> 30:22.696
/t a voids raising too much suspicion.

30:22.780 --> 30:25.943
But when I asked her,

30:26.033 --> 30:29.901
she looked at me l/ke she didn ’t know
what / was talking about.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.742
/ mean, she hired me!

30:33.833 --> 30:36.916
And where exactly were you
when you had this argument?

30:38.963 --> 30:40.919
I’m ready to arrest the teacher.

30:41.048 --> 30:44.381
I wouldn’t do that
ifl were you.
She had opportunity and motive.

30:44.468 --> 30:47.084
And she admits to arguing with Danielle
the day before the murder.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.170
Yeah. But I saw no signs
that she was lying.

30:49.265 --> 30:51.551
Typically, only an innocent person
is gonna admit to an argument.

30:51.642 --> 30:54.304
A guilty person won’t admit
to anything that would seem incriminating.

30:54.395 --> 30:56.681
You’re saying it wasn’t her?

30:56.772 --> 30:58.728
Don’t know.

30:58.816 --> 31:01.683
But I’d like to see how she reacted
when she was confronted by her teacher.

31:01.777 --> 31:06.066
I wanna see the tape
from that video camera
the day that she was confronted.

31:06.157 --> 31:08.773
There’s still no audio.
You won’t be able to hear
what Danielle said.

31:08.868 --> 31:12.235
I don’t need to hear what she said.
Ijust wanna see her face.

31:17.251 --> 31:19.788
Emily, let me help you.
[Laughs]

31:19.879 --> 31:22.746
Oh. Yeah. Thanks, Gillian.

31:26.385 --> 31:29.047
You okay?
Y-Yeah.

31:29.138 --> 31:31.800
Just my dad being—

31:31.891 --> 31:33.882
Yeah. He can do that.

31:33.976 --> 31:36.683
He never lets me do
anything fun.

31:36.771 --> 31:40.013
Oh, you mean like having a hundred friends
over and getting pulled in by the cops?

31:40.149 --> 31:42.936
Uh,yeah.Yeah,erthat
Yeah.

31:43.027 --> 31:45.814
He knew something was going on
when you called, you know.

31:45.905 --> 31:49.648
He did? Well, why didn’t he say anything?

31:51.118 --> 31:53.985
If he said something
every time you lied to him,

31:54.080 --> 31:56.287
oh, he knows he’d lose you.

31:59.335 --> 32:01.792
Tox results are in.

32:01.879 --> 32:04.541
Buck Rogers tested positive
for a little drug we call venlafaxine.

32:04.632 --> 32:06.839
For treating depression and anxiety.

32:06.926 --> 32:09.918
He was self-medicating
and lying about it to NASA.

32:10.012 --> 32:14.631
Yeah. But the tox screen showed
he was still taking the drug
at the time ofthe crash.

32:14.725 --> 32:17.512
He didn’t have a suicidal impulse
from withdrawal.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.685
Well, then why did he crash the plane?

32:19.772 --> 32:23.515
Drug side effects include time loss,
disorientation and dizziness.

32:23.609 --> 32:26.772
You add intense speed and g-force
from the newjet technology,

32:26.862 --> 32:29.069
you got a very pricey pile of scrap metal.

[ Imitates Explosion]

32:32.409 --> 32:34.400
I didn’t take any medication.

32:34.495 --> 32:37.783
- I’ve never even heard of— What’s it called?
- Venlafaxine.

32:37.915 --> 32:40.201
Tox screen doesn’t lie, Commander.
Well, maybe it’s a mistake.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.954
I mean, labs have been known
to make mistakes.

32:43.045 --> 32:45.878
Commander Markov, I’m turning your case
over to theJustice Department.

32:45.965 --> 32:49.878
I wasn’t taking anything.
You have to believe me.

32:53.097 --> 32:55.554
Can I have a second?

32:57.560 --> 33:00.518
I think the commander’s
telling the truth.
Tox screen came back positive.

33:00.604 --> 33:04.392
- What he’s saying isn’t true.
- You can say something
that’s untrue and still not be lying.

33:04.483 --> 33:07.270
- How?
- Ifyou don’t know it’s a lie.

33:16.829 --> 33:20.287
I don’t understand.
You’re saying that my wife was dosing me?

to cheat for her, then who did?

to succeed more than she did.

not with her scores.

didn’t even have to know.

38:08.287 --> 38:11.529
She had nothing to do with this.

38:12.833 --> 38:14.744
It was me.

38:16.128 --> 38:19.245
/ overheard Daniel/e
arguing with Riley..

38:19.339 --> 38:23.173
and threatening to expose her.

38:23.260 --> 38:25.751
I-I couldn’t— I couldn’t let her ruin
my daughter’s life.

38:30.934 --> 38:33.016
So I...

38:33.103 --> 38:35.845
followed her into the park, and...

38:37.441 --> 38:39.397
l-l did it.

38:44.490 --> 38:48.449
- I killed her.
- You’re under arrest
for the murder of Danielle Stark.

38:50.287 --> 38:52.278
You wanna come with me, sir?

38:53.916 --> 38:56.157
[Sighs]
Ijust—

38:56.251 --> 39:00.745
There’s one problem.
I don’t think he did it.

39:07.721 --> 39:10.758
[Cal]
Hey How you doing?

39:11.934 --> 39:13.925
[Door Closes]

39:14.019 --> 39:17.102
I’ve got, uh—
I’ve got nothing more to say.

39:18.982 --> 39:22.691
I’m not F.B.I.
I told them to wait outside, so—

39:22.778 --> 39:26.020
Why? I-I told them what I did.
I killed her.

39:26.114 --> 39:29.857
Yeah. I just wanna show you
a few photographs.

39:29.952 --> 39:31.863
All right.

39:31.954 --> 39:34.240
What do you see?

39:36.208 --> 39:39.996
- What is this?
- It’s the Stratton-Meyerhoff
Personality Test.

39:40.087 --> 39:44.000
- So, please, what do you see?
- It’s a clown.

39:44.091 --> 39:47.959
I know it’s a clown.
What emotion does he make you feel?

39:48.053 --> 39:50.590
- What does this have to do with anything?
- It’s a simple question.

39:50.681 --> 39:53.218
It’s a simple question. What do you see?

39:54.476 --> 39:57.092
Uh, sadness.

39:57.229 --> 39:59.811
I guess.
Okay, well, that’s good.

40:00.941 --> 40:02.681
And this one?

40:05.779 --> 40:08.395
Happiness,joy. I don’t know.

40:08.490 --> 40:10.572
And this one?

40:10.659 --> 40:14.151
[Groaning]
What are you trying to do?

40:14.246 --> 40:17.329
I’m trying to prove
that you didn’t kill Danielle Stark.

40:17.416 --> 40:19.748
But I told you that I did.

40:19.835 --> 40:22.952
Now, Mr. Berenson, there is
no Stratton-Meyerhoff test.
Ijust made that up.

40:23.046 --> 40:25.253
I wanted to get...

40:25.340 --> 40:29.629
an honest reaction to this photograph.

40:29.720 --> 40:33.338
And what I got was... horror...

40:34.474 --> 40:36.385
and surprise.

40:38.395 --> 40:41.432
Now, a real killer—
if confronted with his victim—

40:41.523 --> 40:46.358
would show disgust,
contempt, even fear.

40:47.487 --> 40:51.025
But not surprise. Never surprise.

40:52.576 --> 40:57.570
Now, Mr. Berenson,
I know you’re trying
to protect your daughter.

40:57.664 --> 41:01.953
You probably even think that you’re doing
the right thing by taking the blame for her.

41:03.712 --> 41:08.206
You can’t protect her from this.

41:12.596 --> 41:14.587
I can’t.

41:16.308 --> 41:19.175
I can’t let my daughter go to prison.

41:20.854 --> 41:23.186
She didn’t mean to kill her.

41:23.273 --> 41:26.481
She wasjust—

41:26.568 --> 41:29.901
just trying to stop—

41:32.407 --> 41:34.659
/ wish she ’d never told me.

41:35.952 --> 41:38.204
I wish I didn’t know.

[Bag Zipping]

42:34.636 --> 42:37.924
- What?
- Nothing.

42:38.014 --> 42:40.141
Good work.

42:43.603 --> 42:46.970
I know what you were saying before
about girls my age.

42:48.817 --> 42:52.480
- Good.
- And considering,

42:52.571 --> 42:55.688
I guess you do a pretty good job
of restraining yourself.

42:57.367 --> 43:01.201
- From what?
- From calling me a liar when
you know I’m up to something.

43:02.622 --> 43:04.613
Well, I’m sorry I always know.

43:07.335 --> 43:10.293
