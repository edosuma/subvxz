00:14.097 --> 00:18.268
<i>You'd think loneliness</i>
<i>would be impossible all crammed in here.</i>

00:19.728 --> 00:22.814
<i>But this train</i>
<i>was designed to separate us...</i>

00:23.857 --> 00:27.026
<i>from our possessions, from our loved ones.</i>

00:30.739 --> 00:34.868
<i>Now, every last shred of us</i>
<i>is worth something to someone.</i>

00:40.040 --> 00:44.669
<i>Everything's rare,</i>
<i>so you gotta pay with something personal.</i>

00:46.504 --> 00:50.467
<i>And we're all trading up</i>
<i>for the most valuable thing there is:</i>

00:51.050 --> 00:52.177
<i>access.</i>

00:54.596 --> 00:59.476
<i>Access all the way to First,</i>
<i>where they hold the table for sport...</i>

01:00.477 --> 01:03.313
<i>...then trade it right back down.</i>

01:08.193 --> 01:12.363
<i>People avoid me</i>
<i>because I care for the Sleepers,</i>

01:12.447 --> 01:17.327
<i>but that's my value,</i>
<i>how I open doors and live in Second.</i>

01:17.410 --> 01:22.749
<i>I can trade for things, while the weakest</i>
<i>can only trade their carbon for compost.</i>

01:29.380 --> 01:31.424
<i>So we keep pushing.</i>

01:31.508 --> 01:36.262
<i>Pushing uptrain,</i>
<i>pushing for access to feel more alive.</i>

01:36.346 --> 01:40.225
<i>Access is freedom. Access is power.</i>

01:40.725 --> 01:46.189
<i>We'd kill for that on </i>Snowpiercer,
<i>1,001 cars long.</i>

02:22.809 --> 02:24.102
<i>I can't be with you.</i>

02:26.146 --> 02:27.480
<i>Good luck, Andre.</i>

02:29.816 --> 02:32.694
We don't even know what the Nightcar is,
what they'll make you do up there.

02:32.777 --> 02:34.696
-Anything's better than this.
-Zarah...

02:34.779 --> 02:37.282
I'll die. I can't do it anymore.

02:38.074 --> 02:39.117
It's my decision.

02:40.869 --> 02:41.953
Hey.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.546
We held on to these for a long time,

02:52.422 --> 02:54.591
but they're worth more now as a commodity,

02:55.592 --> 02:57.552
to trade if you get into trouble.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.140
Good luck, Andre.

03:07.103 --> 03:09.772
- There she is.
- Goddamn sellout.

03:09.856 --> 03:13.735
Yeah, go on. Go show those
rich men how we do it in the Tail.

03:13.818 --> 03:16.529
Just walking away, huh?
Just walk away!

03:16.613 --> 03:18.948
-Good for you.
- She's actually going!

03:52.857 --> 03:53.816
Up.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.621
All right, can we settle?
Let's settle down, please.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.334
Thank you.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.180
-Good morning.
- Good morning.

04:24.264 --> 04:27.976
We all know it's been a tough 48 hours.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.563
It seems the events have been
on Mr. Wilford's mind as well.

04:32.647 --> 04:35.441
He's written a personal message
for us all.

04:37.902 --> 04:40.071
"To my loyal and trusted crew,

04:40.154 --> 04:42.949
without whom this mission
could never succeed.

04:43.866 --> 04:48.913
In this time of adversity, I ask you,
the lead stewards of humanity,

04:48.997 --> 04:53.918
to remain unshaken in spirit and resolve,

04:54.002 --> 04:56.879
as you've done so nobly
these past seven years.

04:58.006 --> 05:02.343
By your steady hand,
we will ride out this hardship

05:02.427 --> 05:04.470
and outlive the ice.

05:06.222 --> 05:11.102
Bound by our cause and our need.
Wilford."

05:13.479 --> 05:15.440
Winston Churchill.

05:17.817 --> 05:21.362
-I'm sorry?
-"Unshaken in spirit and resolve."

05:22.572 --> 05:26.034
Mr. Wilford was paraphrasing Churchill.

05:28.077 --> 05:31.706
-I'll tell him you noticed.
- Tell him there's unrest brewing.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.626
The murders, a Tailie uprising.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.005
Third will feel the brunt
of the rationing.

05:39.088 --> 05:41.257
There's already talk of job action.

05:41.924 --> 05:46.596
To that point, Mr. Wilford suggests
we work to ease the minds of passengers

05:46.679 --> 05:48.014
while we do repairs.

05:48.097 --> 05:52.393
Ruth? What if we moved
next week's prizefight up to tonight?

05:52.477 --> 05:55.188
Distraction? It's brilliant.

05:55.271 --> 05:56.522
We make an event of it,

05:56.606 --> 05:59.609
and the winner gets a full upgrade
from Third to Second.

05:59.692 --> 06:02.195
-It's aspirational for Third,

06:02.278 --> 06:04.781
and it'll remind First
how good they actually have it.

06:04.864 --> 06:08.034
Commander? You can handle the fight?

06:09.494 --> 06:10.953
Of course.

06:11.037 --> 06:14.832
-Good. Settled.
-The Engine will provide.

06:23.633 --> 06:24.926
Get off of me.

06:25.718 --> 06:26.719
Get off me!

06:36.312 --> 06:37.939
Oh...

06:40.358 --> 06:43.569
Did that frighten you?
It was Mr. Wilford's idea.

06:44.570 --> 06:45.905
At least with a bag on my head,

06:45.988 --> 06:48.282
I know how much
Wilford actually wants me to see.

06:48.366 --> 06:52.620
Let me explain clearly.
We each have our place up here.

06:53.412 --> 06:54.413
Our lane.

06:55.206 --> 06:59.085
And until you earn Mr. Wilford's trust,
your lane is narrow.

07:00.086 --> 07:04.674
Your only concern is finding out
who tortured and killed Sean Wise.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.884
And if you try communicating
with the Tail again,

07:06.968 --> 07:08.845
I'll stick your head out a port myself.

07:13.975 --> 07:17.228
Can I have access to the witness
of the first murder yet?

07:19.272 --> 07:20.106
No.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.775
She's still unconscious.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.361
Well...

07:27.238 --> 07:32.160
does Wilford trust me enough to let me
know what Sean Wise was informing on?

07:33.494 --> 07:34.495
Yes.

07:35.955 --> 07:38.666
Sean Wise kept tabs on the black market.

07:38.749 --> 07:39.834
He was trying to find the source

07:39.917 --> 07:42.170
of a new drug wreaking havoc
in Third. Kronole.

07:42.253 --> 07:45.923
Kronole's not new.
It's been in the Tail for two revolutions.

07:48.092 --> 07:49.552
Oh, you're not getting a cut?

07:50.887 --> 07:53.973
Authoritarian states usually control
their own drug trade.

07:54.056 --> 07:57.685
<i>Snowpiercer </i>is an ark.
It's not an authoritarian state.

07:58.394 --> 08:00.104
Okay.

08:00.646 --> 08:04.859
Well, if Sean Wise was looking in
for Kronole, then that's where we start.

08:04.942 --> 08:07.111
All you gotta do is go down on a Brakeman.

08:08.821 --> 08:11.741
Your boy Oz trades K
for blowjobs in the Tail.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.078
Well, look at you, Detective.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.748
Already working on the case.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.335
You should see me without the handcuffs.

08:24.378 --> 08:27.256
Brakeman Till, you're out of uniform.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.261
Somehow, it's my fault the Tailie
got out of his cell last night.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.138
-I wasn't even--
-Will you shut up?

08:59.163 --> 09:01.374
Must be pretty nice up here in Second.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.919
Or do you just lie around in bed all day?

09:06.254 --> 09:08.589
You don't find it a little aspirational?

09:15.388 --> 09:16.430
Some of it.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.736
Nikki falsely imprisoned.

09:31.779 --> 09:36.242
A cannibal ring right under my nose.
It's embarrassing.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.374
And now I can't even find my underwear.

09:46.919 --> 09:47.920
Hey.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.509
Nikki's our only witness,

09:53.593 --> 09:56.220
but that bitch from Hospitality's
blocking access to her.

09:56.304 --> 09:59.307
Yeah, you won't get much out of Nikki.
She's still confused.

09:59.890 --> 10:01.726
I thought she was unconscious.

10:04.395 --> 10:07.064
-I wouldn't go there, Bess.
-Why not?

10:07.148 --> 10:10.026
Because if Melanie's doing it,
it's what Wilford wants.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.360
Okay. Well...

10:12.361 --> 10:15.906
it's that kind of thinking
that put an innocent girl in the Drawers.

10:22.246 --> 10:23.164
Hey.

10:23.873 --> 10:26.250
You don't want to cross paths
with Melanie Cavill.

10:28.085 --> 10:29.378
Then I'll go around her.

10:38.804 --> 10:42.808
Osweiller, shifty little dodger.
I can't wait to slap him with this.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.478
Good, but hold up.
You're at an impasse with this case.

10:45.561 --> 10:48.397
So today, I'm shaking the hell out of
this tree to make something fall out.

10:48.481 --> 10:51.692
The train is like a small town,
so everyone's gonna know you're coming.

10:51.776 --> 10:55.029
Two years ago, you put Nikki in a drawer
for a crime she didn't commit.

10:55.112 --> 10:58.240
Now, you don't know if Sean Wise
was murdered by that same psychopath

10:58.324 --> 11:02.119
or if it's somebody trying to complicate
the murder of a Wilford informant.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.163
-Your point?
-My point is...

11:04.246 --> 11:05.665
I lead this time.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.417
Tailies come pouring out onto us.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.045
You start sticking pikes in those animals,
they back up quick.

11:11.128 --> 11:11.962
Oz...

11:12.046 --> 11:14.048
Heard you went crawling out of there
on your hands and knees.

11:14.131 --> 11:16.008
And you left your partner behind. Move it.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.093
Yes, sir.

11:23.974 --> 11:25.101
What's this about, sir?

11:25.643 --> 11:27.937
You traded Kronole
for blowjobs in the Tail?

11:29.021 --> 11:30.356
Gonna listen to a Tailie?

11:35.403 --> 11:37.363
Who's your supplier?

11:37.446 --> 11:42.368
Supplier? No, no. All right, look.

11:43.702 --> 11:45.913
I passed a little Kroney
to the Tail, okay?

11:45.996 --> 11:47.623
It was just from the stuff
that we confiscated.

11:47.706 --> 11:49.667
It was for that Tailie woman
whose arm they froze off.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.420
It was a humanitarian act.

11:52.503 --> 11:54.130
Did you know Sean Wise?

11:56.090 --> 11:57.842
-What, the dead guy?
-Yeah, the dead guy.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.593
Why? What's that got to do with it?

12:00.845 --> 12:02.888
I swear on the train, boss.

12:06.934 --> 12:08.853
- All right, I'm going.

12:12.148 --> 12:13.524
Watch the neckline, yeah?

12:17.194 --> 12:20.364
-Look, Terence, I was coming to see you.
-Oh, shut it.

12:21.490 --> 12:23.576
Why is the Lead Brakeman leaning on you?

12:23.659 --> 12:27.163
He's asking about Kroney.
I didn't say nothing.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.039
Well, that's good.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.168
What about the Tailie detective he's with?

12:34.003 --> 12:36.839
We, uh... we pulled him out to work
on the Sean Wise murder.

12:38.507 --> 12:42.261
-So how'd he get to Kroney?
-He's smart. Dunno.

12:44.889 --> 12:48.392
-I wouldn't underestimate him.
-Don't worry about that.

12:48.476 --> 12:51.687
We'll give that cop a nice warm welcome.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.621
Roche, look, hey!

13:08.704 --> 13:11.832
I already told you,
Zarah didn't kill the Wilford rat.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.876
Well, she was gonna have
a baby with him, wasn't she?

13:15.336 --> 13:18.839
Look, she lived with him.
What did he tell her?

13:18.923 --> 13:21.592
You talked to my guy,
now I'm gonna talk to yours.

13:26.222 --> 13:29.141
-Sean worked for Ag-Sec.
-He was also a spy.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.310
I didn't know he had
anything to do with any of this.

13:31.393 --> 13:33.062
-He mention Kronole to you?
-No.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.648
Anybody connected with
making it or distributing it?

13:35.731 --> 13:38.108
-He didn't mention drugs at all.
-Hmm.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.402
I mean, he bragged sometimes
about knowing people

13:40.486 --> 13:42.530
who could get him whatever he needed.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.825
You're not new here.
You know how the underground works.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.285
Who was it?

13:49.495 --> 13:52.498
Tunnelmen? Nightcar staff?

13:52.581 --> 13:55.960
-Janitors?
-I don't know anything specific.

13:56.043 --> 13:59.630
You're saying he was a spy,
so he wasn't sharing it with us.

13:59.713 --> 14:02.633
Is that it? 'Cause I gotta
get ready for Fightnight.

14:03.634 --> 14:06.887
-What's that?
-Don't worry, you won't be attending.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.432
- Janitors.
-It's okay.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.982
Oh! Snake eyes. That's another item, York.

14:18.065 --> 14:19.358
Whoo! Off with it.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.780
- Run along now, girls.

14:25.322 --> 14:27.449
Evening. Hi.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.413
- "Fightnight"?
-Perhaps you'll lose more.

14:32.496 --> 14:34.874
Robert loves a fight. Don't you, Robert?

14:34.957 --> 14:37.167
-Ruth, I see you.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.128
With your surprise casino

14:39.211 --> 14:40.796
and your Roman games.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.300
You're just misdirecting us
from an extinction event.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.135
-Snap!

14:47.344 --> 14:52.433
Seriously, Ruth, we realize
that this is no longer a pleasure cruise.

14:52.516 --> 14:56.312
But our fortunes built this train,
and Mr. Wilford is losing control.

14:58.022 --> 15:01.233
Resources crashing,
insurrection in the Tail.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.445
Fightnight is nothing
but a bald-faced distraction.

15:05.362 --> 15:09.283
Yes, but it's an entertaining distraction.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.953
Please, show some solidarity
with the train.

15:13.037 --> 15:16.498
These people work hard, you know.
And it lifts them just to see you.

15:17.082 --> 15:19.126
Yeah, Mom, do it for the Thirdies.

15:19.960 --> 15:20.794
Snap!

15:21.337 --> 15:23.255
- Oh, come on!

15:23.923 --> 15:25.090
Come on, Daddy.

15:26.383 --> 15:29.511
Come on, sweetheart,
let's make a night of it.

15:30.137 --> 15:31.347
You can get dressed up.

15:49.573 --> 15:50.616
Married, right?

15:52.034 --> 15:53.077
Twenty years.

15:54.536 --> 15:55.537
Kids?

15:59.333 --> 16:00.501
We doing this?

16:03.837 --> 16:04.838
Three kids.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.008
Two of 'em didn't make it.

16:13.305 --> 16:14.306
Hard choices.

16:14.807 --> 16:18.477
We hold them close, they keep us going.

16:21.146 --> 16:23.107
It was the same thing
when Zarah went uptrain.

16:24.984 --> 16:28.654
-She was my warmth.
-Tomato soup and a grilled cheese.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.710
Think Sean Wise got killed
on this Kronole tip?

16:43.335 --> 16:47.339
Or did Wilford's rat just get his dick
chopped off by a serial perv?

16:49.925 --> 16:51.093
You ever meet Wilford?

16:51.927 --> 16:54.179
Shook his hand a few times
before we boarded,

16:54.263 --> 16:56.473
but, you know, the Engine's biosecure now.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.017
He speaks through Melanie.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.813
-Hey, I told you to stay home.
-I got something.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.649
-It turns out Nikki's awake.
- Okay.

17:05.733 --> 17:08.402
Take Layton. Keep an eye on him.

17:08.485 --> 17:10.029
-I'm having my lunch.
- Let's go.

17:22.291 --> 17:25.419
-Hey.
-I've got the crack under control.

17:25.502 --> 17:28.172
Bojan's team's behind
on the cattle car window.

17:28.255 --> 17:31.842
Oh, shit! We can't keep
pumping heat down here.

17:32.384 --> 17:35.846
-The main banks are near an all-time low.
-And more mountains to come.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.850
-I can offer one immediate solution.
-What?

17:39.933 --> 17:40.934
We uncouple the Tail.

17:44.021 --> 17:49.109
I mean we move the Tailies into Third,
cut the empty weight loose onto a siding.

17:49.193 --> 17:54.782
That would be civil war in Third.
No, we need a more viable solution.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.913
God, I wish I were welding.

18:02.539 --> 18:05.125
Ma'am. Ma'am. Ma'am. I...

18:09.963 --> 18:10.964
This is Melanie.

18:12.007 --> 18:14.551
-It's me.
<i>-Hey, what's up?</i>

18:15.135 --> 18:18.138
<i>We don't want the investigators</i>
<i>to see Nikki like this, right?</i>

18:18.680 --> 18:20.349
No. Why?

18:22.518 --> 18:24.394
Till might be on her way soon.

18:26.021 --> 18:27.231
Thanks, Jinju.

18:35.572 --> 18:37.866
Make it quick.
She's supposed to be off-limits.

18:37.950 --> 18:42.204
-Nikki? Nikki? She's out of it.

18:42.287 --> 18:44.832
Oh, that's a common
postsuspension reaction.

18:44.915 --> 18:45.958
Yeah, she's got a fever.

18:46.041 --> 18:48.085
That's perfectly normal.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.295
It's not like sleep.

18:50.379 --> 18:51.588
What's not? The Drawers?

18:51.672 --> 18:54.758
Oh, she's just disorientated. Everyone
comes out of it a little differently.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.885
-She's gonna be fine in a few days.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.762
Nikki, can you open your mouth for me?

18:59.304 --> 19:00.472
Oh.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.808
- I wouldn't recommend that.
- Oh, Jesus.

19:02.891 --> 19:04.685
Looks a lot like Kronole withdrawal,
doesn't it?

19:04.768 --> 19:06.728
Oh, no. She's just a long-term Sleeper.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.063
Nikki, has anyone given you Kronole?

19:08.147 --> 19:09.523
- Of course not.
-What's Kronole?

19:09.606 --> 19:10.732
Will it make me feel better?

19:10.816 --> 19:13.652
She's not cleared
for visitors yet, Doctor.

19:13.735 --> 19:14.945
We heard she was awake.

19:15.028 --> 19:17.156
That doesn't mean
she's ready to be questioned.

19:17.739 --> 19:22.911
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Now. Now. Please, let's let her rest.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.205
This is bullshit.

19:25.289 --> 19:28.125
Is your suspension drug
some version of Kronole?

19:28.959 --> 19:31.253
-Of course not.
-Her gums are black.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.922
That's a very common
postsuspension reaction.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.090
Maybe it's the other way around.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.885
Maybe Kronole's a street version
of their suspension drug.

19:37.968 --> 19:39.761
The materials are tightly controlled.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.389
It's not possible, is it?

19:47.436 --> 19:50.689
Klimpt... what have you done?

19:57.988 --> 20:02.159
You skimmed the suspension drug,
then what? Who did you give it to?

20:02.743 --> 20:03.785
Courier comes.

20:03.869 --> 20:07.456
Sometimes, it's a janitor.
Different person each time.

20:07.539 --> 20:12.085
-What did you get?
- Just supplies for the Sleepers.

20:12.169 --> 20:15.339
Vegetable balms to prevent bedsores.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.592
Mr. Wilford didn't think of everything.

20:19.635 --> 20:23.931
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I had no idea they made Kronole from it.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.767
Would you give us a moment, please?

20:35.901 --> 20:37.152
What's going on with these two?

20:37.236 --> 20:39.196
Mmm-hmm. That's what I want to know.

20:39.279 --> 20:42.115
Mr. Wilford's put
an enormous amount of faith in you.

20:44.034 --> 20:45.202
What the hell is this?

20:46.745 --> 20:47.996
What the hell is this?

20:48.747 --> 20:50.832
-This is Miles' hair.
-Layton...

20:50.916 --> 20:53.085
-Miles?
-Layton, stop.

20:53.168 --> 20:54.294
-Miles?
- Layton, stop.

20:54.378 --> 20:55.629
-What did you do to him?
- Stop it!

20:55.712 --> 20:57.965
Stop. It's not what you think.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.344
Miles made the apprenticeship program.

21:05.639 --> 21:06.807
He made apprentice?

21:07.391 --> 21:11.311
Yes, and he's fine.
We just gave him a haircut.

21:13.063 --> 21:14.564
I want to see him right now.

21:16.608 --> 21:21.738
Objects in motion stay in motion
at the same velocity unless...

21:22.531 --> 21:23.615
Anybody?

21:25.450 --> 21:26.451
Miles?

21:27.160 --> 21:29.204
The object is acted on
by an external force.

21:29.871 --> 21:31.999
Correct. Thank you, Miles.

21:33.417 --> 21:36.753
I got my own bunk with a curtain,
my own fork.

21:36.837 --> 21:39.506
And I ate this thing.
It's called a tangerine.

21:39.589 --> 21:42.426
Heard you're nailing
the science, too, bro.

21:42.509 --> 21:44.553
I have 100% on all my tests.

21:44.636 --> 21:45.804
See? That's what I'm talking about.

21:45.887 --> 21:48.640
-You're gonna be an engineer.
-I don't know about that.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.023
Josie's gotta be worried about us.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.191
Yeah, she is.

22:02.237 --> 22:04.656
You see any of the other kids
from the apprenticeship?

22:06.033 --> 22:08.243
Mikala's apprenticing in Laundry.

22:08.827 --> 22:11.038
And Mia, I don't know.

22:15.083 --> 22:16.752
Miles, it's time for dinner.

22:16.835 --> 22:19.254
Oof! Don't you love dinner?

22:28.597 --> 22:30.223
I'm keeping my eyes open.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.211
Okay. Let me down.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.343
That was Blanca Peak.

23:06.426 --> 23:07.677
What's the problem?

23:08.261 --> 23:09.721
We should have passed it yesterday.

23:11.306 --> 23:12.808
We should be running full tilt,

23:12.891 --> 23:15.143
just banking power
to climb the Sierra Madre.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.771
So that impact yesterday
caused some serious damage.

23:17.854 --> 23:20.857
And we were already losing time.
Whatever happened made it a lot worse.

23:21.358 --> 23:23.693
The year-four slowdown lasted a month.

23:24.194 --> 23:26.738
It started with darkness, water rations.

23:26.822 --> 23:31.535
The question is, when does our drain
on resources outweigh our value as labor?

23:32.035 --> 23:34.162
Right before the Sierra Madre, I reckon.

23:34.746 --> 23:37.207
- Look, look, look.
-We're a day behind.

23:37.290 --> 23:41.586
Wilford hasn't uncoupled us yet.
All we've gotta do is hunker down.

23:41.670 --> 23:44.548
Agreed. Double bunks, half water.

23:44.631 --> 23:46.049
- Mmm-hmm. Agreed.
-Agreed.

23:46.133 --> 23:50.345
All right, let's pull everyone forward.
Double-up to conserve heat.

23:50.428 --> 23:51.304
Okay. All right.

23:51.388 --> 23:55.183
Our people uptrain will help us...
somehow.

24:00.355 --> 24:02.065
Thank you for letting me see him.

24:02.149 --> 24:04.776
Well, hopefully now we can focus
on our next steps.

24:06.153 --> 24:07.154
Melanie.

24:08.738 --> 24:13.618
I have to see Josie, his Tail mom.
I convinced her to let him go.

24:14.452 --> 24:16.121
I know she's worried sick about him.

24:17.414 --> 24:20.125
Till can get her a message
next time she's down there.

24:21.209 --> 24:25.130
Look, she really needs
to hear from me that he's okay.

24:25.213 --> 24:28.216
How about when you ID Sean Wise's killer,
I'll let you see her.

24:29.009 --> 24:31.970
It's too late to get downtrain anyway.
The fights are tonight.

24:32.053 --> 24:33.722
Yeah, I was just thinking that.

24:35.599 --> 24:36.433
"Fightnight."

24:38.435 --> 24:40.729
Feels like a pretty good place
to find a janitor.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.440
Yeah, but if they're slinging Kronole,

24:43.523 --> 24:47.319
they're not exactly gonna sit down
and have a chat with the train detective.

24:47.402 --> 24:49.821
How about we leave that
to the train detective?

24:52.407 --> 24:53.909
Watch his back, Brakeman.

25:00.832 --> 25:03.043
<i>Members of the board, as you well know--</i>

25:04.252 --> 25:07.505
<i>...as you well know,</i>
<i>I am not one for speeches.</i>

25:08.548 --> 25:09.883
<i>...one for speeches.</i>

25:09.966 --> 25:11.051
<i>But we've been--</i>

25:11.134 --> 25:14.179
<i>After exceeding earnings</i>
<i>in the fourth-quarter financials, </i>

25:14.262 --> 25:17.432
<i>it's safe to say</i>
<i>that we've been through a bumpy patch.</i>

25:18.850 --> 25:23.271
<i>I am not one for speeches,</i>
<i>but we've been through a bumpy patch.</i>

25:23.355 --> 25:24.773
<i>And my advisors tell me--</i>

25:26.524 --> 25:28.193
<i>So I want to say this to you...</i>

25:32.364 --> 25:34.032
<i>Attention all passengers.</i>

25:34.616 --> 25:36.785
<i>Due to ongoing engineering repairs,</i>

25:36.868 --> 25:41.081
<i>Second and Third Class may experience</i>
<i>diminished electrical supply.</i>

25:41.665 --> 25:45.835
<i>All of us at Wilford Industries</i>
<i>thank you for your patience.</i>

26:00.225 --> 26:02.352
Fight! Fight! Fight!

26:14.906 --> 26:17.450
Who's got a bid for me?
This is Fightnight!

26:17.534 --> 26:20.412
Welcome to the Nightcar!
Let me hear you scream!

26:26.084 --> 26:28.044
Yeah! Come on!

26:28.712 --> 26:29.879
Okay.

26:32.882 --> 26:37.679
-First Class, it's up there.
-Hey! One fox fur on Right Hand Man!

26:37.762 --> 26:39.848
-Whoo!

26:39.931 --> 26:41.725
One of the fighters is a janitor.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.478
That's them in white.

26:46.187 --> 26:48.398
But I don't really know
who's who over there.

26:48.481 --> 26:49.774
It's not my beat.

26:50.942 --> 26:51.776
How you doing?

26:51.860 --> 26:52.694
Yeah!

26:55.238 --> 26:57.115
<i>Good evening, passengers.</i>

26:58.158 --> 27:02.495
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Fightnight.

27:04.289 --> 27:05.915
Kinda everywhere, isn't she?

27:06.624 --> 27:10.211
The prize tonight for the victor,
a coveted upgrade to Second Class.

27:12.756 --> 27:15.216
<i>But before we begin,</i>
<i>it is my honor to announce </i>

27:15.300 --> 27:20.388
that Mr. Wilford himself
would like to say a few words.

27:22.432 --> 27:25.977
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>Good evening, passengers.</i>

27:26.061 --> 27:29.481
<i>As you well know,</i>
<i>I am not one for speeches,</i>

27:29.564 --> 27:34.069
<i>but we've been through a bumpy patch,</i>
<i>so I want to say this to you.</i>

27:34.152 --> 27:36.488
<i>If the track has taught me anything, </i>

27:36.571 --> 27:40.325
<i>it's that even the steepest climbs</i>
<i>give way to descent.</i>

27:40.408 --> 27:45.288
<i>I'll keep doing what I do best.</i>
<i>I will keep our Engine Eternal.</i>

27:45.372 --> 27:51.211
<i>And you keep doing what you do best.</i>
<i>Survive, survive, survive.</i>

27:51.294 --> 27:55.840
Survive! Survive! The Engine will provide!

27:56.341 --> 27:58.301
Wilford! Wilford!

28:01.221 --> 28:03.390
Wilford! Wilford!

28:05.767 --> 28:09.062
And on that note, let the fight begin.

28:10.397 --> 28:11.773
Wait back there.

28:20.031 --> 28:22.283
Zarah's working behind the bar.

28:23.493 --> 28:24.577
All right.

28:25.954 --> 28:26.913
Hey.

28:27.622 --> 28:30.458
She is never gonna talk to me
with you attached to my hip.

28:32.127 --> 28:34.129
I know this woman, okay?

28:35.004 --> 28:37.799
We're gonna get a lot more information
out of her if I go alone.

28:39.050 --> 28:41.136
-All right, go.
- Hey.

28:41.219 --> 28:43.763
Keep an eye on those guys, all right?
Make sure none of them leave.

28:44.889 --> 28:46.099
And watch your back.

28:50.687 --> 28:51.688
There.

28:52.397 --> 28:55.692
There he is, the train detective.

28:57.277 --> 28:59.571
I hope that's his undercover look.

29:19.257 --> 29:21.718
-So glad you're still okay.
-Who are these janitors?

29:23.845 --> 29:27.515
The guy with the beard over there
is Terence, Sean's Kronole connection.

29:29.142 --> 29:31.102
He's head janitor.
Watch yourself with him.

29:31.186 --> 29:32.771
Oh, I just want to say hello.

29:33.438 --> 29:35.356
I can ask if he'll meet with you.

29:35.440 --> 29:36.900
How bad do you need this?

29:37.484 --> 29:38.610
It's the first key.

29:38.693 --> 29:40.737
Well, there's always a price with Terence.

29:44.157 --> 29:45.533
My wedding ring?

29:50.038 --> 29:51.998
You gave it to me the day I left the Tail.

29:53.041 --> 29:55.543
I traded mine, but I kept yours, so...

29:56.127 --> 29:58.713
you can have it back now
so you can trade it if you need to.

30:01.508 --> 30:05.762
I've been thinking about what you said,
about staying up here with you.

30:08.056 --> 30:10.016
I still love you, Zarah.

30:13.186 --> 30:15.188
-But--
-I know, Andre.

30:17.023 --> 30:18.525
I know the Tail needs you.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.445
I love you, too.

31:37.395 --> 31:39.105
You're not a janitor, Brakeman.

31:40.148 --> 31:44.152
Surprise, surprise. They didn't want
to deal with Wilford's pet detective.

31:46.029 --> 31:51.117
Wilford sent me up here
to pry into their business.

31:52.368 --> 31:54.621
If I was Terence, I'd want to talk to me.

31:55.663 --> 31:58.833
Twice in one day
I'm stuck dealing with you.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.586
And I need to speak with Terence.

32:01.669 --> 32:02.754
What, so you come here?

32:02.837 --> 32:06.633
You know he can't risk you,
a bloody Tailie on top of that.

32:07.425 --> 32:09.093
You're just pissing him off.

32:09.177 --> 32:14.265
So go out there, and you tell him
that I got eyes on me, too.

32:14.349 --> 32:17.060
I'm gonna lose Till
so that we can be alone.

32:17.602 --> 32:18.645
Okay.

32:20.563 --> 32:22.982
You think I don't have
more dirt on you, Osweiller?

32:24.609 --> 32:27.403
Me and your boss Roche,
we getting pretty close.

32:28.029 --> 32:30.073
I could probably just make some shit up.

32:30.865 --> 32:33.201
Or maybe Terence never sees Kronole again.

32:37.121 --> 32:39.248
Go tell him, Brakeman.

32:43.711 --> 32:45.088
You're bleeding crazy, man.

32:53.596 --> 32:57.433
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

32:59.394 --> 33:02.855
Shit. Nikki? Nikki?

33:09.028 --> 33:10.738
-What are you doing here?
-I need Kronole.

33:12.740 --> 33:14.993
Look, look, look. Remember who that is?

33:17.412 --> 33:20.039
She killed someone.
What's she doing out?

33:20.540 --> 33:21.666
She's innocent.

33:30.216 --> 33:33.386
Mr. Layton...
You're a pain in the ass.

33:35.680 --> 33:36.681
Come on.

34:45.291 --> 34:48.127
Well, if it isn't
the famous Tailie detective.

34:49.045 --> 34:50.171
You want a date?

34:51.714 --> 34:52.715
Hmm?

35:05.103 --> 35:08.022
The name is Terence. Never "Terry."

35:11.234 --> 35:15.029
So you come out to solve a murder
and my chemicals dry up.

35:15.113 --> 35:15.947
Come on.

35:16.823 --> 35:19.700
That shit's poison, Terence.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

35:23.538 --> 35:25.331
You ever sell Kronole to Sean Wise?

35:25.915 --> 35:28.668
Why? Because he was screwing your wife?

35:28.751 --> 35:32.255
No, because he was a Wilford informant.

35:35.550 --> 35:37.468
Well, I didn't kill him.

35:38.052 --> 35:40.346
-Don't put that on me.
-No.

35:40.429 --> 35:43.182
-You don't want that kind of publicity.
-Yeah.

35:44.559 --> 35:49.689
So, um... how much does Wilford know
about his Kroney problem?

35:49.772 --> 35:51.440
Very little, yet.

35:52.024 --> 35:53.734
Bet if I give him something
about this murder,

35:53.818 --> 35:55.736
he'd probably forget
about the whole thing.

36:04.370 --> 36:08.416
You know what I was in the Old Time,
before I was a janitor?

36:10.042 --> 36:10.960
A janitor.

36:12.378 --> 36:14.005
Cleaned a high-rise building.

36:14.088 --> 36:16.966
I get on this train,
and you know what I see?

36:17.550 --> 36:20.178
The train is just a high-rise
laying on its side.

36:21.262 --> 36:22.680
I know how this thing runs.

36:23.639 --> 36:26.851
And my building just became
the whole goddamn world.

36:27.685 --> 36:29.604
Some people never had it so good.

36:31.606 --> 36:33.941
Ah, I'm still looking for better.

36:34.775 --> 36:39.113
Third Class and the Tail,
70% of the population.

36:39.197 --> 36:43.284
Yeah. Maybe we could see
who's in the penthouse.

36:48.748 --> 36:50.208
It's nice to dream.

36:59.425 --> 37:01.552
I saw Sean the night he was killed.

37:03.137 --> 37:07.308
He came down to score K with another guy.
No one I'd seen before.

37:08.100 --> 37:09.560
Can you describe him?

37:09.644 --> 37:11.187
Not from these corridors.

37:11.270 --> 37:17.902
Um, First Class, maybe. Early thirties.
Um, buzz cut. Takes care of himself.

37:31.207 --> 37:36.087
There's one more thing I need, Terence.
Something very small.

37:42.760 --> 37:45.930
Home you go, people! The border is closed!

37:46.013 --> 37:48.808
The subtrain to Third is out of order.
You're walking home to Third!

37:48.891 --> 37:52.853
It was a great success,
despite a riot breaking out.

37:52.937 --> 37:54.897
Maybe even because of it.

37:54.981 --> 37:57.483
Well, I'll put the riot to bed.
You put them to bed.

37:57.566 --> 37:58.609
And, Ruth...

37:59.527 --> 38:00.361
good job.

38:01.028 --> 38:03.656
It's an honor just to carry out
Mr. Wilford's wishes.

38:06.617 --> 38:08.035
All right.

38:08.119 --> 38:11.914
The border is closed! No pushing.
Nice and easy, please.

38:11.998 --> 38:13.374
Keep it calm.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.337
-I've got some information for you.
-What?

38:18.421 --> 38:21.424
-Last call, I'm afraid.
- Shame.

38:21.507 --> 38:24.260
We were just waltzing down
the Champs-Élysées.

38:24.343 --> 38:25.845
-You're good.

38:26.470 --> 38:29.557
Oh, well, you may have
distracted us for one night, Melanie,

38:29.640 --> 38:33.477
but in a year or two, when you serve up
history's last bœuf bourguignon...

38:34.437 --> 38:36.939
I won't lie. It's serious.

38:38.649 --> 38:41.110
Mr. Wilford could always
cut loose the Tail.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.904
I'm glad you had a good evening.

38:45.031 --> 38:46.615
And safe home, LJ.

38:48.868 --> 38:49.952
Come along, darling.

39:03.007 --> 39:06.010
Layton has the description of a man
who was with Sean Wise

39:06.093 --> 39:07.595
just before he was murdered.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.221
But?

39:09.305 --> 39:12.141
Oh, I'm not gonna tell you
till you let me go see Josie in the Tail.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.652
Josie Wellstead.

39:57.853 --> 39:59.647
I thought you were dead.

40:00.147 --> 40:02.274
What did they do to you?
Why did they pull you out?

40:02.358 --> 40:03.359
I'm fine.

40:04.485 --> 40:05.903
I'm fine. Just listen.

40:08.364 --> 40:09.448
I talked to Miles.

40:10.116 --> 40:15.454
You'd be so proud. He's in a class.
He's learning real science.

40:16.122 --> 40:17.164
And you saw him?

40:17.248 --> 40:19.834
-And he's eating, three squares.

40:20.626 --> 40:22.086
He's got his own fork.

40:27.425 --> 40:30.553
I saw Zarah.
I had it all wrong in my head.

40:30.636 --> 40:35.433
This whole time, I've not been seeing
what was right in front of my eyes.

40:37.685 --> 40:40.438
I miss you, Josie, and I am so sorry.

40:43.232 --> 40:44.233
Me, too.

40:45.693 --> 40:46.986
I miss you, too.

40:49.071 --> 40:50.114
That's enough.

40:52.908 --> 40:56.162
He's got his own bed.
And there's other kids.

40:56.245 --> 40:58.747
And he misses you, Josie.

40:58.831 --> 41:01.500
It's only doors between us!

41:14.597 --> 41:15.806
So, who are we looking for?

43:02.580 --> 43:05.040
You don't remember me, do you, Nikki?

43:11.255 --> 43:12.965
But you do know who I am.
