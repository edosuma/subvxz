00:01.784 --> 00:04.700
[instrumental music]

00:19.367 --> 00:21.064
The girls were
last seen leaving

00:21.151 --> 00:23.284
Sullivan's Tavern,
1:00 in the morning.

00:23.371 --> 00:27.244
A truck driver spotted the car
around 5:30 and called it in.

00:27.331 --> 00:29.594
Look, I only have
four deputies.

00:29.681 --> 00:33.294
Only a couple of 'em have ever
seen a body killed in anger.

00:33.381 --> 00:35.513
If what we have here
is a homicide

00:35.600 --> 00:37.254
I'm gonna need some help.

00:37.341 --> 00:40.170
Just to be clear,
except in special circumstances

00:40.257 --> 00:42.825
we don't help out.
We take over.

00:42.912 --> 00:45.175
You need to be okay
with that.

00:45.262 --> 00:47.786
Okay. I guess.

00:47.873 --> 00:49.310
[dog barking]

00:49.397 --> 00:51.790
She's not really
a morning person.

00:51.877 --> 00:53.879
She'll improve.

00:53.966 --> 00:55.968
Names of
the missing women?

00:56.056 --> 00:58.275
Nicole Gilbert
and Kara Palmer.

00:58.362 --> 01:00.234
Local girls, both 21.

01:00.321 --> 01:03.367
'Work together in
a hunting store in town.'

01:03.454 --> 01:06.718
Last night was
Nicole's engagement party.

01:06.805 --> 01:08.372
The car was found
exactly like this?

01:08.459 --> 01:10.026
Yep. Well, no.

01:10.113 --> 01:13.073
Uh, the door was open just
like that. We popped the trunk.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.075
[dog barking]

01:18.904 --> 01:20.776
Ah, yep.
Dead as a dodo.

01:20.863 --> 01:23.126
No gas either.
They must have left it running.

01:23.213 --> 01:24.432
Hey, there's a different set
of tire tracks here

01:24.519 --> 01:25.737
that pulled off the road.

01:25.824 --> 01:28.479
A truck or a big SUV,
looks like.

01:28.566 --> 01:30.046
They're still fresh.

01:30.133 --> 01:34.355
Must be from the trucker
who called in the car.

01:34.442 --> 01:35.747
Make sure forensics
gets a mold.

01:35.834 --> 01:36.879
Yep.

01:36.966 --> 01:38.315
[sniffing]

01:38.402 --> 01:40.012
What's going on
with your dog?

01:40.100 --> 01:43.668
Oh, he's confused somehow.
This behavior?

01:43.755 --> 01:46.280
He's saying, "Hey, look!
Here they are!"

01:46.367 --> 01:48.195
Give me my
slim Jim already.

01:48.282 --> 01:50.414
Parker, do you have a better dog
close by somewhere?

01:50.501 --> 01:53.765
Sir, this is the best dog
in the county.

01:53.852 --> 01:56.464
Come on, Dexter.
People are waitin' on us.

01:56.551 --> 01:59.031
- Did you look under the car?
- Under the car?

01:59.119 --> 02:01.599
- Yeah.
- Of course, we looked.

02:06.082 --> 02:09.433
[indistinct radio chattering]

02:09.520 --> 02:12.393
Oh, crap.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.003
One or two?

02:16.136 --> 02:17.180
One.

02:19.791 --> 02:21.663
It's Kara Palmer.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.055
So..

02:23.143 --> 02:25.667
...where's Nicole Gilbert?

02:25.754 --> 02:28.148
[male #1]
'Nicole!'

02:30.150 --> 02:32.717
Good boy, Dexter.
He's got her on lock now.

02:32.804 --> 02:34.284
Is there any way to tell
from the scent trail

02:34.371 --> 02:35.764
how fast Nicole was moving?

02:35.851 --> 02:38.288
Oh, sure.
Dexter's detecting skin cells.

02:38.375 --> 02:39.811
They fall off your body
all the time

02:39.898 --> 02:41.639
at a pretty consistent rate.

02:41.726 --> 02:43.598
The faster you move,
the thinner the trail you leave.

02:43.685 --> 02:45.556
So are we following
Nicole on foot

02:45.643 --> 02:47.341
or Nicole tied up
in the back of a truck?

02:47.428 --> 02:48.733
I don't know.

02:48.820 --> 02:50.431
You said you can tell
how fast she was moving.

02:50.518 --> 02:53.608
Oh, Dexter can tell.
I'm just walking behind him.

02:53.695 --> 02:56.698
- 'Nicole, can you hear us?'
- Tell us about Kara and Nicole.

02:56.785 --> 02:58.439
I've known them practically
their whole lives.

02:58.526 --> 03:00.615
Kara was a real sweetheart.

03:00.702 --> 03:01.964
'You'll find
no one around here'

03:02.051 --> 03:03.835
'say a bad word
about Kara Palmer.'

03:03.922 --> 03:05.794
Good churchgoing family,
no trouble at all.

03:05.881 --> 03:08.057
Meaning Nicole Gilbert
wastrouble.

03:08.144 --> 03:10.755
Nicole, well,
she had her problems.

03:10.842 --> 03:13.149
Drugs and drug-related
foolishness mostly.

03:13.236 --> 03:14.455
Fraud, petty theft.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.152
- Any violent offenses?
- No. No.

03:16.239 --> 03:17.936
[Sheriff]
'She was more of
a troubled soul'

03:18.023 --> 03:19.590
'than a bad person.'

03:19.677 --> 03:22.463
'Tough life. Her mom died when
she was seven.'

03:22.550 --> 03:25.248
Her father raised her
on meth and hot dogs.

03:25.335 --> 03:28.382
'He's in prison now
for drug dealing.'

03:28.469 --> 03:31.994
Kara and her family were all
the stability Nicole ever had.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.691
So she and Kara
were good friends.

03:33.778 --> 03:35.302
Odd match.

03:35.389 --> 03:37.565
[Sheriff]
'Yeah, real close
since they were little.'

03:37.652 --> 03:39.958
In a small town, you don't
choose your friends.

03:40.045 --> 03:44.180
They're the same age.
They're female. That's enough.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.748
Kyle, boys,
thank you for coming.

03:46.835 --> 03:49.272
Sheriff.
Where do you want us?

03:49.359 --> 03:52.014
Well, you know this valley
as well as anyone.

03:52.101 --> 03:54.190
- Just pick your spots.
- Do we know if she's armed?

03:54.277 --> 03:55.670
What do you know
about this case?

03:55.757 --> 03:58.542
Uh, same thing
as everybody else, I guess.

03:58.629 --> 04:00.501
Some badass townie girl
got mad drunk

04:00.588 --> 04:03.678
stabbed her friend to death
and ran off into the woods.

04:03.765 --> 04:05.549
Kara Palmer died
from loss of blood.

04:05.636 --> 04:07.551
'Nicole Gilbert is missing.'

04:07.638 --> 04:09.379
'Maybe she ran off.
Maybe she was abducted.'

04:09.466 --> 04:10.554
'We don't know.'

04:10.641 --> 04:12.774
Don't assume anything.

04:12.861 --> 04:14.906
Message received
and understood, ma'am.

04:14.993 --> 04:18.040
Alright, fellas.

04:18.127 --> 04:20.651
You knew Nicole.
You think she did this?

04:20.738 --> 04:22.392
Who knows what others
are capable of?

04:22.479 --> 04:24.786
'She sure had built up
a lot of bad karma.'

04:24.873 --> 04:27.310
But I don't know. She seemed
to be turning her life around.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.617
Bad karma doesn't have
an expiration date.

04:29.704 --> 04:32.402
Uh, actually, it does

04:32.489 --> 04:35.405
according to traditional
Buddhist teachings.

04:35.492 --> 04:36.450
I'm counting on it.

04:39.844 --> 04:41.672
[Lisbon]
Let's go.

04:41.759 --> 04:44.153
[instrumental music]

05:00.125 --> 05:02.650
People in town are already
saying Nicole did this.

05:02.737 --> 05:05.870
But I don't believe it.

05:05.957 --> 05:08.960
She will have to tell me herself
that she did this

05:09.047 --> 05:10.353
before I believe it.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.837
Nicole loved our daughter

05:15.924 --> 05:18.622
and we loved Nicole
almost like she was our own.

05:18.709 --> 05:22.322
- Almost.
- Why, why would she kill her?

05:22.409 --> 05:24.628
She had her troubles,
Lord knows, but..

05:24.715 --> 05:26.238
She wasn't crazy.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.892
Has there been any tension
between them recently?

05:27.979 --> 05:31.243
- Oh, nothing.
- No. None at all.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.290
- Well..
- Yes?

05:34.377 --> 05:37.293
That boy.
That, that fiancé of Nicole's.

05:37.380 --> 05:38.686
Jason O'Toole.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.688
We never met him
but once or twice

05:40.775 --> 05:42.559
and he seemed nice enough.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.996
He works lumber.
You know how those fellas are.

05:45.083 --> 05:46.302
Like to play the buck.

05:46.389 --> 05:47.651
All but sleep at
Sullivan's Tavern.

05:47.738 --> 05:49.523
But, these days,
you have to look past

05:49.610 --> 05:53.178
the piercings and the tattoos
and all that, don't you?

05:53.265 --> 05:55.442
But Kara didn't
think much of him.

05:55.529 --> 05:57.705
- No?
- Didn't approve.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.576
I think there might have been
some tension there.

05:59.663 --> 06:01.230
What was her problem
with Jason?

06:01.317 --> 06:03.841
Oh, I guess
just a feeling

06:03.928 --> 06:06.104
that he wasn't
trustworthy, you know?

06:06.191 --> 06:07.802
But Nicole was in love

06:07.889 --> 06:09.412
and she thought Kara
was just jealous

06:09.499 --> 06:11.414
'cause Kara didn't
have a boyfriend.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.111
Did Jason ever get
violent with Nicole?

06:13.198 --> 06:15.505
Not that I heard,
but I wouldn't be surprised.

06:15.592 --> 06:18.029
Nicole had her fair
share of that type.

06:18.116 --> 06:21.990
- Kara didn't have a boyfriend?
- Kara could've had anyone.

06:23.731 --> 06:26.168
She had no shortage
of suitors.

06:26.255 --> 06:28.083
But have you seen
the men around here?

06:28.170 --> 06:31.042
It's all drunken lumberjacks

06:31.129 --> 06:33.044
and hippie pot farmers.

06:33.131 --> 06:34.350
Kara had..

06:36.308 --> 06:38.572
She had higher standards
than that.

06:38.659 --> 06:40.051
[sobbing]

06:48.582 --> 06:52.150
What's the problem now,
Parker?

06:52.237 --> 06:54.631
Trail's cold, sheriff.

06:54.718 --> 06:56.285
Best dog in
the county, huh?

06:57.721 --> 06:59.070
Come on, Dexter.

07:00.942 --> 07:03.814
[instrumental music]

07:04.641 --> 07:06.251
Nicole!

07:08.384 --> 07:11.518
- She can't answer you.
- Or doesn't want to.

07:11.605 --> 07:13.824
No, she's a captive or dead.

07:13.911 --> 07:15.260
How do you know that?

07:15.347 --> 07:18.655
How far have we come?
What, five miles?

07:18.742 --> 07:21.266
Nicole would've been barefoot,
probably drunk.

07:21.353 --> 07:22.964
It was a dark night.

07:23.051 --> 07:25.053
There's no way she could
cover that distance.

07:25.140 --> 07:26.184
Someone must have her
in a vehicle

07:26.271 --> 07:27.708
and Dexter lost
the scent.

07:27.795 --> 07:30.754
Okay. So you're in charge now.
What do we do?

07:30.841 --> 07:32.626
[Jane]
'It's close to evening.
Call off the search.'

07:32.713 --> 07:34.236
Gather everybody
together and--

07:34.323 --> 07:36.804
Give up?
There's a girl missing.

07:36.891 --> 07:39.502
Tell me, of the men
on this search party

07:39.589 --> 07:41.939
which one would you guess
is a violent sexual predator?

07:42.026 --> 07:43.332
What kind of
question is that?

07:43.419 --> 07:44.420
Whose name just popped
into your head?

07:44.507 --> 07:45.943
Someone's did.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.641
Huh? There's always someone.

07:47.728 --> 07:49.904
This is your method?

07:49.991 --> 07:52.167
Asking people to guess
who've done it?

07:52.254 --> 07:53.647
Strange kind of detective
work you guys do.

07:53.734 --> 07:55.213
Jane's being dramatic

07:55.300 --> 07:57.781
but if somebody did victimize
Kara and Nicole

07:57.868 --> 07:59.522
statistics show that
they'd be really likely

07:59.609 --> 08:00.784
to join the search party.

08:00.871 --> 08:02.046
They enjoy the deceit.

08:02.133 --> 08:04.266
It's like being
the invisible man.

08:04.353 --> 08:05.963
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.487
So gather up the search party.

08:07.574 --> 08:10.098
Let me have a crack at 'em.

08:10.185 --> 08:11.403
He gets results.

08:13.318 --> 08:15.320
I know all these guys.

08:15.407 --> 08:19.803
I'll vouch for
every one of them.

08:19.890 --> 08:20.935
Well, most of them.

08:22.893 --> 08:25.766
[instrumental music]

08:29.247 --> 08:30.597
I'll call 'em in.

08:30.684 --> 08:32.207
[bells jingling]

08:33.861 --> 08:36.472
[tires peal]

08:36.559 --> 08:38.213
[tires screeching]

08:40.607 --> 08:43.697
- Jason O'Toole?
- Get your truck outta my way.

08:43.784 --> 08:45.046
We need to talk to you
about Nicole Gilbert.

08:45.133 --> 08:46.743
I don't have time
for this, guys.

08:46.830 --> 08:48.179
Let's have a little chat.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.707
Where were you going
in such a hurry, Jason?

08:53.794 --> 08:56.057
Back to the woods
to find Nicole.

08:56.144 --> 08:57.275
How do you know
she was in the woods?

08:57.362 --> 08:59.495
I don't.
I hope she's in the woods.

08:59.582 --> 09:01.279
'cause if she's not
in the woods then she can be

09:01.366 --> 09:02.890
anywhere in the frickin'
world, right?

09:02.977 --> 09:04.761
Why not search with
the rest of the town?

09:04.848 --> 09:06.807
Nah, I cover more
ground alone.

09:06.894 --> 09:09.287
Why did Kara drive Nicole home
after the party? Why didn't you?

09:09.374 --> 09:11.899
- Because I was too drunk.
- Or maybe you two had a fight.

09:11.986 --> 09:14.728
No. We were celebrating
our engagement.

09:14.815 --> 09:16.643
That's right about when
the fights start.

09:16.730 --> 09:19.080
We video'd the whole thing.
Okay? You can watch it and see.

09:19.167 --> 09:20.734
- There's no fighting.
- We'll do that.

09:20.821 --> 09:23.084
- Where is that video?
- It's in my truck.

09:23.171 --> 09:26.304
There's this whole Kara issue
we have to talk about.

09:26.391 --> 09:28.350
- Maybe that blew up, huh?
- What issue?

09:28.437 --> 09:29.917
Well, Kara didn't like you

09:30.004 --> 09:31.701
'didn't think you were
good enough for Nicole'

09:31.788 --> 09:33.007
thought you were untrustworthy.

09:33.094 --> 09:36.097
That's funny.
Is that what you do?

09:36.184 --> 09:38.621
You try to get me all upset
or somethin' so I look guilty?

09:38.708 --> 09:40.318
Does it upset you?

09:40.405 --> 09:42.233
That Kara didn't like you?
She was trying to undermine you?

09:42.320 --> 09:46.977
I couldn't care less, okay?
'cause it's not true anyhow.

09:47.064 --> 09:48.979
Kara liked me well enough.

09:49.066 --> 09:50.677
Least I never heard
her say different.

09:50.764 --> 09:53.331
Where were you between
1:00 and 7:00 A.M. last night?

09:56.291 --> 09:59.294
I was here,
passed out on the floor.

10:04.299 --> 10:05.735
[whimpering]

10:05.822 --> 10:08.782
We'll regroup in the morning,
first light.

10:08.869 --> 10:12.220
Before you go,
Patrick Jane from the CBI

10:12.307 --> 10:14.048
would like to have a word
with all of you.

10:14.135 --> 10:17.312
Thanks, Sheriff Nelson.

10:17.399 --> 10:20.054
I want you to look at me,
all of you

10:20.141 --> 10:23.013
and listen closely.

10:23.100 --> 10:26.190
I'd like you to raise your hands
above your heads like this.

10:28.366 --> 10:31.282
Both hands.

10:31.369 --> 10:33.937
You, too, sheriff.

10:34.024 --> 10:35.722
And you, Agent Lisbon.

10:37.680 --> 10:38.638
Please.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.207
Good. Very good.

10:43.294 --> 10:45.862
One of you, one of you here
killed Kara Palmer

10:45.949 --> 10:47.516
and abducted Nicole Gilbert.

10:47.603 --> 10:50.127
I want that person to lower
their right hand now.

10:59.049 --> 11:00.050
Uh, okay.

11:00.137 --> 11:02.009
Okay, uh, usually gets a hit.

11:03.706 --> 11:04.794
Forget I even spoke.

11:07.579 --> 11:09.059
[female dispatcher]
'Sheriff Nelson,
we have a 10-28'

11:09.146 --> 11:10.408
'reported on Nicole Gilbert.'

11:10.495 --> 11:12.976
'A gas station
convenience store.'

11:13.063 --> 11:15.109
'I repeat,
10-28 on Nicole Gilbert.'

11:15.196 --> 11:16.545
Copy that.

11:28.949 --> 11:30.341
She had a nasty blow
to her head

11:30.428 --> 11:31.778
moderate concussion.

11:31.865 --> 11:33.388
Her feet are badly abraded.

11:33.475 --> 11:36.043
And she has a lot of minor
scratches and bruises.

11:36.130 --> 11:37.522
Mild hypothermia.

11:37.609 --> 11:41.178
Physically, she'll be fine
in a day or so.

11:41.265 --> 11:43.180
Mentally, it's another story.

11:43.267 --> 11:45.182
'When you brought her in'

11:45.269 --> 11:47.619
'she was in some kind
of a psychotic state.'

11:47.707 --> 11:50.405
'We've medicated her
to take the edge off that'

11:50.492 --> 11:52.363
'but she's
still in deep shock.'

11:52.450 --> 11:54.061
'She has no memory at all'

11:54.148 --> 11:55.279
of the events
that brought her here.

11:55.366 --> 11:56.628
That's convenient.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.587
If I just stabbed
my best friend to death

11:58.674 --> 12:00.371
I'd want to forget, too.

12:00.458 --> 12:01.721
As soon as
she's well enough

12:01.808 --> 12:03.331
I'm charging her
and taking her to jail.

12:03.418 --> 12:05.855
Sheriff, you have custody
of Nicole, but the CBI's

12:05.942 --> 12:07.944
leading this investigation.

12:08.031 --> 12:09.729
I decide when to file charges.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.121
We don't have
the full facts yet.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.776
[Nelson]
'Facts?
She's covered in blood.'

12:13.863 --> 12:15.647
'She's carrying what looks
to be the murder weapon'

12:15.735 --> 12:18.520
'which the forensic guys say
has Kara's blood on it.'

12:18.607 --> 12:20.957
What more do you want?

12:21.044 --> 12:23.786
Is she well enough
to speak to?

12:23.873 --> 12:26.136
[sighs]
As long as you're
gentle with her.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.621
Have you told her
Kara's dead?

12:32.708 --> 12:34.101
No, we don't want
to upset her.

12:34.188 --> 12:35.537
- Mm.
- She's very fragile.

12:35.624 --> 12:37.191
Yeah.

12:41.369 --> 12:42.544
Nicole?

12:44.633 --> 12:46.330
My name is Teresa Lisbon.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.332
I'm with the California
bureau of investigation.

12:48.419 --> 12:49.681
Hi.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.509
We want to ask you
a few questions

12:51.596 --> 12:52.989
about what happened
to you and Kara.

12:53.076 --> 12:55.600
I told the doctor
I can't remember.

12:55.687 --> 12:57.777
That's okay.

12:57.864 --> 13:00.301
What's the last thing
youdoremember?

13:00.388 --> 13:02.651
My party.

13:02.738 --> 13:04.305
'I remember leaving Sullivan's'

13:04.392 --> 13:07.787
'and getting in
the car with Kara.'

13:07.874 --> 13:10.659
You know where
my fiancé is?

13:10.746 --> 13:12.748
Do you remember anything
else about the party?

13:12.835 --> 13:14.924
We had a good time.

13:15.011 --> 13:17.318
Nothing bad or
unusual happened?

13:17.405 --> 13:18.536
No.

13:18.623 --> 13:21.496
We drank a lot..

13:21.583 --> 13:23.672
danced.

13:23.759 --> 13:24.716
[sighs]

13:24.804 --> 13:27.328
Where's Kara?

13:27.415 --> 13:30.548
You and Kara left the Sullivan
in her car.

13:30.635 --> 13:32.637
Then what happened?

13:32.724 --> 13:33.856
I don't know.

13:33.943 --> 13:35.640
[sighs]

13:35.727 --> 13:37.294
I don't know.
That's what I'm telling you.

13:37.381 --> 13:39.862
'The next thing I remember,
I was in this bed.'

13:42.952 --> 13:45.694
What's wrong with me?
What happened?

13:45.781 --> 13:46.913
Where's Kara? Why won't
anyone tell me anything?

13:47.000 --> 13:48.523
Sshh, it's okay.

13:48.610 --> 13:51.178
- She's dead.
- Jane!

13:51.265 --> 13:53.180
Stabbed to death.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.098
No.

14:00.056 --> 14:02.798
- Why did you say that?
- She was gonna find out anyway.

14:02.885 --> 14:06.584
- The doctor said to be gentle.
- Ah, doctors.

14:06.671 --> 14:08.369
[continues crying]

14:08.456 --> 14:11.502
Open your eyes, Nicole.

14:11.589 --> 14:14.027
Look at me.

14:14.114 --> 14:15.767
Open your eyes.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.335
[breathing heavily]

14:20.120 --> 14:23.079
I told you the truth
because you can handle it.

14:23.166 --> 14:25.734
You have to.
You will.

14:29.607 --> 14:30.826
Tell me you will.

14:33.220 --> 14:34.482
What you have to do now

14:34.569 --> 14:36.527
you have to remember
what happened.

14:36.614 --> 14:39.704
[crying softly]

14:39.791 --> 14:42.403
- Close your eyes and remember.
- Jane..

14:42.490 --> 14:44.274
Close your eyes.

14:48.278 --> 14:50.324
'You were driving with Kara
down flagship road.'

14:50.411 --> 14:52.500
- Pull over.
- What?

14:52.587 --> 14:54.328
Pull over!

14:54.415 --> 14:57.418
[Jane]
'Why did you stop?'

14:57.505 --> 14:59.550
[Nicole]
'I was feeling sick.'

14:59.637 --> 15:01.813
[coughing]

15:01.901 --> 15:04.773
[male #2]
'Hey.'

15:04.860 --> 15:07.210
[panting]

15:07.297 --> 15:09.125
There's a man.

15:09.212 --> 15:11.998
- What does he look like?
- I don't know. I can't see.

15:12.085 --> 15:13.782
It's dark.

15:13.869 --> 15:15.784
'I can hear..'

15:15.871 --> 15:19.222
a loud rushing sound..

15:19.309 --> 15:20.441
...like water.

15:21.790 --> 15:24.358
[imitates running water]

15:26.403 --> 15:27.578
Then what happened?

15:27.665 --> 15:31.104
I..
I don't know.

15:31.191 --> 15:35.412
- I can't remember.
- You have to.

15:35.499 --> 15:37.675
- No, I can't.
- You have to.

15:37.762 --> 15:39.416
[Nicole]
'I can't remember.'

15:39.503 --> 15:40.983
- You have to.
- I can't. I...

15:41.070 --> 15:42.376
[monitor beeping rapidly]

15:42.463 --> 15:44.073
What have you been
doing to her? Out!

15:45.770 --> 15:47.642
[monitor continues
beeping rapidly]

15:47.729 --> 15:50.166
[telephone ringing in distance]

15:56.303 --> 15:57.565
[Sheriff]
'That's bull.'

15:57.652 --> 15:59.219
She's got amnesia,
but not so badly

15:59.306 --> 16:01.221
she can't finger somebody else
for killing Kara.

16:01.308 --> 16:03.005
'Rushing water, my ass.'

16:03.092 --> 16:06.574
No, she's telling the truth.
Something happened.

16:06.661 --> 16:09.055
Something too horrible
for her mind to handle.

16:09.142 --> 16:11.187
- Her memory's blocked.
- Well, even if that's true.

16:11.274 --> 16:13.146
Maybe it's blocked
because she killed Kara.

16:13.233 --> 16:16.192
That's possible.
I don't think so.

16:16.279 --> 16:18.542
- I think she's a victim.
- How can you tell?

16:22.938 --> 16:25.506
- It's in her eyes.
- Oh.

16:25.593 --> 16:28.683
Well, then,
why didn't you say so?

16:28.770 --> 16:29.814
It's in her eyes.

16:31.512 --> 16:33.905
Here's me
looking for facts.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.125
Why would she kill
her best friend?

16:36.212 --> 16:38.823
- What's her, uh, motive?
- Why do women kill other women?

16:38.910 --> 16:40.129
Over men.

16:40.216 --> 16:42.349
Could've been
fighting over Jason

16:42.436 --> 16:43.785
though he's no Brad Pitt.

16:43.872 --> 16:44.960
She was covered in blood.

16:45.047 --> 16:47.223
- Yes?
- But it rained.

16:47.310 --> 16:49.878
It rained hard for a good
few hours last night.

16:49.965 --> 16:51.532
Only when they
recovered Nicole

16:51.619 --> 16:53.751
she was still covered
in blood. So..

16:53.838 --> 16:55.623
So she must've been under
good cover when it rained.

16:55.710 --> 16:58.104
- She must've been indoors.
- She was hiding.

16:58.191 --> 17:00.149
Or she was a captive,
probably near the river.

17:00.236 --> 17:01.759
Hence the sound
of rushing water.

17:03.805 --> 17:05.024
[cell phone ringing]

17:07.635 --> 17:09.854
Rigsby, get a couple park
rangers and organize a search

17:09.941 --> 17:12.248
of all the empty summer cabins,
storage units and sheds

17:12.335 --> 17:14.207
within an earshot of the river,
caves, too.

17:14.294 --> 17:16.992
Oh, and, Rigsby, have Van Pelt
set up the video Jason shot

17:17.079 --> 17:19.038
of the party
at Sullivan's Tavern.

17:19.125 --> 17:20.517
- You got it, boss.
- Let's go.

17:20.604 --> 17:23.085
Hmm.
Uh, sheriff?

17:23.172 --> 17:25.783
There's a man out there
that needs to silence Nicole

17:25.870 --> 17:26.915
before she recovers
her memory.

17:27.002 --> 17:28.917
- So you say.
- So I say.

17:31.354 --> 17:34.140
No one should
enter her room.

17:34.227 --> 17:35.489
Make sure your men
keep her safe.

17:36.533 --> 17:38.666
I know my business.

17:38.753 --> 17:40.972
You mindyours..

17:41.060 --> 17:42.322
...whatever in
the heck it is.

17:44.411 --> 17:47.109
[instrumental music]

17:51.940 --> 17:53.724
[Van Pelt]
How's Jason's alibi look?

17:53.811 --> 17:57.163
Alibi's solid. Several people
saw him passed out at the bar.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.078
Damn.
Nelson was right.

17:59.165 --> 18:01.297
- About what?
- Look at Jason's camera work.

18:01.384 --> 18:04.822
He's torn between
Nicole and Kara.

18:04.909 --> 18:07.651
- I love this girl.
- I love this girl.

18:07.738 --> 18:09.349
- And I love you, baby.
- So he had a thing for Kara.

18:09.436 --> 18:11.438
It's no proof of motive
unless Nicole knew about it.

18:11.525 --> 18:13.962
And it doesn't look like they're
feuding over him, does it?

18:14.049 --> 18:15.833
I'm gettin' married!

18:15.920 --> 18:17.574
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

18:17.661 --> 18:20.447
Wait. Stop right there.
Run it back.

18:20.534 --> 18:22.188
[Lisbon]
'There.'

18:22.275 --> 18:24.146
The guy at the bar
staring at Kara

18:24.233 --> 18:25.234
in the baseball cap.

18:25.321 --> 18:28.933
I can blow it up.

18:29.020 --> 18:30.152
Yeah, let's get a better
look at that hat.

18:33.851 --> 18:35.897
"Earthly Pure."
What is that?

18:35.984 --> 18:40.771
That's the brand of cosmetics
we found in Kara's vehicle.

18:40.858 --> 18:43.122
Can we match that image
to the DMV database?

18:43.209 --> 18:44.862
I can try.

18:44.949 --> 18:46.864
[instrumental music]

18:52.479 --> 18:53.654
[Cho]
'Rulon Farnes.'

19:03.054 --> 19:05.144
Truck driver for
Earthly Pure cosmetics.

19:05.231 --> 19:08.277
I can call the company,
see if I can get a track on him.

19:08.364 --> 19:09.583
Mm, yeah.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.237
Anything?

19:11.324 --> 19:12.890
We searched every
cabin and shack. Nothing.

19:12.977 --> 19:14.414
Have them drop you back
at the station.

19:14.501 --> 19:16.720
Okay, boss.

19:16.807 --> 19:18.809
- Where you goin'?
- For a walk.

19:21.899 --> 19:24.075
[door closing]

19:30.821 --> 19:31.909
How you doing?

19:35.086 --> 19:37.785
People are saying
that I killed Kara.

19:37.872 --> 19:41.005
That's why there's a policeman
outside, so that I don't escape.

19:41.092 --> 19:43.791
Hmm.

19:43.878 --> 19:45.227
Did you..

19:45.314 --> 19:46.272
...kill Kara?

19:47.664 --> 19:50.014
I don't know.

19:50.101 --> 19:51.581
I don't think I did.

19:54.584 --> 19:55.803
Do you think I did?

19:55.890 --> 19:57.370
No.

19:57.457 --> 19:59.807
Why would you kill Kara?

19:59.894 --> 20:01.461
Yeah.

20:01.548 --> 20:02.723
Why would I kill her?

20:05.987 --> 20:08.207
But the thing is,
I don't know.

20:09.817 --> 20:11.297
I don't think I did, but..

20:11.384 --> 20:12.689
[sighs]
I don't know.

20:12.776 --> 20:16.215
[male #3]
'Hey! Hey, where you going?'

20:16.302 --> 20:17.694
'Get your hands off of me!'

20:17.781 --> 20:19.043
'Don't make me taste you, son.'

20:19.130 --> 20:20.828
Everybody just
take it down a notch.

20:20.915 --> 20:23.352
- Uh, what's going on?
- He was trying to sneak in.

20:23.439 --> 20:25.746
I was just, I was trying
to see my girl, alright?

20:25.833 --> 20:27.226
I was just walking through!

20:27.313 --> 20:29.184
Nobody's allowed
to see her right now.

20:31.969 --> 20:33.144
[male #3]
'Come on.'

20:38.628 --> 20:39.803
Wow.

20:39.890 --> 20:40.848
Are they gone?

20:40.935 --> 20:42.197
Yes.

20:44.678 --> 20:46.245
I'm not ready
to see anyone yet.

20:46.332 --> 20:48.159
Are you okay?
You need me to get the nurse?

20:48.247 --> 20:51.554

35:08.584 --> 35:11.370
- It's vibrating.
- Gasoline or diesel?

35:11.457 --> 35:14.416
- Sounded like a diesel.
- Where is he taking you?

35:14.503 --> 35:17.158
- Is it a long journey?
- No.

35:17.245 --> 35:19.813
No, not long.
Short.

35:19.900 --> 35:24.078
A bumpy road.

35:24.165 --> 35:25.732
Agent Lisbon,
your man Jane

35:25.819 --> 35:28.822
just kidnapped Nicole Gilbert
from the hospital.

35:28.909 --> 35:31.346
- Oh, no.
- 'Oh, yes.'

35:31.433 --> 35:35.785
And I'm not happy.
In fact, I'm mad as hell.

35:35.872 --> 35:37.526
You people are my guests.

35:37.613 --> 35:40.877
You can't come in here
and abduct my suspects!

35:40.964 --> 35:43.880
Sheriff, I will fix this.
Let me get on it right away.

35:43.967 --> 35:45.665
- Son of a bitch.
- What's up?

35:45.752 --> 35:49.147
Personnel issues.
Pick up your phone, damn it.

35:49.234 --> 35:51.540
[cell phone ringing]

35:51.627 --> 35:53.325
[cell phone ringing]

35:57.198 --> 35:58.634
We're stopping now.

36:02.072 --> 36:03.248
'It's like an old shed.'

36:05.772 --> 36:08.296
'It was small and dark.'

36:08.383 --> 36:10.342
'And cold and dusty.'

36:13.562 --> 36:15.173
'I'm scared.'

36:15.260 --> 36:20.134
Help me!
Somebody help me!

36:20.221 --> 36:22.005
The door won't open.
I can't get out.

36:22.092 --> 36:23.485
- You will get out.
- I can't get out!

36:23.572 --> 36:25.226
It's gonna be fine.
The door will open.

36:25.313 --> 36:28.098
It will open.
Is it bolted?

36:29.839 --> 36:31.319
Somebody help!

36:31.406 --> 36:34.888
- 'No.'
- 'Chained?'

36:34.975 --> 36:37.238
No, I don't think so.

36:37.325 --> 36:38.935
I'm trapped.
I'm gonna die.

36:39.022 --> 36:41.199
Oh, my god.
I'm gonna die!

36:41.286 --> 36:42.765
Nicole, you can open it.
It's your choice.

36:42.852 --> 36:44.767
The door is unlocked
if you want it to be.

36:44.854 --> 36:46.639
Open the door, Nicole.
Open it.

36:48.771 --> 36:49.859
[gasps]

36:56.910 --> 36:58.128
It's cold up here
at night, huh?

36:58.216 --> 37:00.870
Yeah, and broiling
during the day.

37:00.957 --> 37:02.481
Worst of both worlds.

37:04.265 --> 37:06.920
[gasps]

37:07.007 --> 37:08.922
He's got a knife on me.

37:12.142 --> 37:13.100
Aah!

37:13.187 --> 37:14.623
[grunting]

37:14.710 --> 37:17.060
He's trying to rape me,
but I won't let him.

37:17.147 --> 37:19.149
Aah!

37:23.763 --> 37:26.113
[cell phone ringing]

37:26.200 --> 37:27.810
Where the hell are you?

37:27.897 --> 37:31.901
Nicole remembered everything.
She can describe the suspect.

37:31.988 --> 37:34.339
We're looking for a tall,
well-built man

37:34.426 --> 37:36.602
with brown hair
and glasses, mid 30s.

37:36.689 --> 37:39.474
That's it? That describes
half the men in California.

37:39.561 --> 37:40.997
'Yeah, that's it'

37:41.084 --> 37:45.306
but at least we know
it wasn't her that killed Kara.

37:45.393 --> 37:47.917
- And it wasn't Rulon Farnes.
- Nice work.

37:48.004 --> 37:50.790
For this you illegally abducted
her from the sheriff's custody?

37:50.877 --> 37:53.183
Yeah. I was gonna
tell you about it

37:53.271 --> 37:54.968
but I figured seeing
that it's illegal

37:55.055 --> 37:57.318
best to keep you out of it
so that you have deniability.

37:57.405 --> 38:00.278
Oh, how considerate of you.

38:00.365 --> 38:04.543
Listen to me carefully
and do exactly as I tell you.

38:04.630 --> 38:06.458
Take her back
to the hospital right now

38:06.545 --> 38:08.460
and sincerely apologize
to Sheriff Nelson.

38:14.988 --> 38:16.511
Wow.
What was all that about?

38:18.992 --> 38:20.428
My bad karma.

38:23.126 --> 38:24.258
How's she doing, anyway?

38:24.345 --> 38:26.956
- Who?
- The girl, Nicole.

38:27.043 --> 38:28.001
How's she holding up?

38:28.088 --> 38:30.743
Okay, considering.

38:30.830 --> 38:33.963
She remember anything yet?

38:34.050 --> 38:38.316
- We're doing what we can.
- Good.

38:38.403 --> 38:39.969
Is there anything else

38:40.056 --> 38:43.321
anything specific that
you can remember about him?

38:47.281 --> 38:50.240
Just what he looked like.
That's all I remember.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.938
Doesn't matter
how small it is.

38:52.025 --> 38:54.462
Little things like
what his voice sounded like

38:54.549 --> 38:58.901
or what he smelled like or..

38:58.988 --> 38:59.946
Pineapple.

39:02.731 --> 39:03.863
That's great.

39:05.386 --> 39:07.606
Is this the last place
to check?

39:07.693 --> 39:09.042
[cell phone ringing]
No, there's one more place.

39:09.129 --> 39:12.437
Alright, let's go.

39:12.524 --> 39:15.614
[ringing continues]

39:15.701 --> 39:18.443
- Hey.
- 'Pineapple.'

39:18.530 --> 39:20.009
He smelled like pineapple.

39:20.096 --> 39:22.708
Pineapple?
What the hell go..

39:28.801 --> 39:31.891
Okay, good.

39:31.978 --> 39:35.068
Listen, tell Rigsby
Teresa needs his help.

39:37.723 --> 39:41.770
Me? I'm at the Eagle Pine Lodge
off Route 6.

39:41.857 --> 39:42.902
Okay.

39:54.304 --> 39:58.047
Kyle, let's stay calm
and think this through.

39:58.134 --> 40:01.529
[chuckles]
Think what through?

40:01.616 --> 40:04.227
I really don't want
to shoot you

40:04.314 --> 40:07.970
but I do have to take you into
custody for killing Kara Palmer.

40:08.057 --> 40:09.319
What are we gonna do
about that?

40:12.888 --> 40:14.934
It's not like I set out
to hurt anyone.

40:15.021 --> 40:16.892
'I just wanted to
talk to Nicole.'

40:16.979 --> 40:20.374
[Lisbon]
'Before she ran off
and got married?'

40:20.461 --> 40:22.637
I've noticed her around town
for a long time.

40:22.724 --> 40:25.727
I didn't want her
marrying that guy Jason.

40:25.814 --> 40:27.468
She's too good for him.

40:27.555 --> 40:29.601
Please, Kyle

40:29.688 --> 40:32.038
I really and truly
do not want to hurt you.

40:34.040 --> 40:35.694
You like your chances,
do you?

40:40.089 --> 40:42.440
[both grunting]

40:48.968 --> 40:51.884
Uh, Lisbon?

40:51.971 --> 40:55.322
- 'Lisbon? Lisbon!'
- Sshh!

40:58.064 --> 40:59.631
You alright?

40:59.718 --> 41:01.894
[whispering]
Yeah.
Did you call Rigsby?

41:01.981 --> 41:05.245
Yeah, he's on his way.
Listen, I have an idea.

41:13.035 --> 41:14.080
[Jane]
'Lisbon, be careful!'

41:14.167 --> 41:15.124
[gunshots]

41:15.211 --> 41:17.387
[dramatic music]

41:28.442 --> 41:31.706
Drop it!

41:31.793 --> 41:34.535
Reallydrop it.

41:34.622 --> 41:35.580
On your knees.

41:38.104 --> 41:40.149
Hands, come on.

41:40.236 --> 41:41.803
Let's go. Come on.

41:48.201 --> 41:49.855
Nice work, Jane.

41:56.688 --> 41:58.341
I was hoping
I'd find you here.

41:58.428 --> 42:00.605
Yeah, we're, uh, we're
just about to hit the road.

42:03.042 --> 42:04.304
Thank you.

42:07.350 --> 42:08.351
It's okay.

42:13.356 --> 42:15.054
You know, uh..

42:15.141 --> 42:17.230
...eventually you'll start
to remember the good things.

42:20.799 --> 42:21.800
Yeah.

42:25.630 --> 42:26.718
It goes without saying.

42:26.805 --> 42:29.547
You're welcome.

42:29.634 --> 42:30.591
You ready to go?

42:33.855 --> 42:35.422
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

42:45.214 --> 42:48.304
Hey, can you believe he fell
for that old cell phone gag?

42:48.391 --> 42:51.569
"Old cell phone gag?" I invented
that right there and then

42:51.656 --> 42:52.961
rather brilliantly,
I thought.

42:53.048 --> 42:56.008
Oh, please, I've seen
that done a dozen times.

42:56.095 --> 42:58.314
- What do you mean? Where?
- On TV.

42:58.401 --> 43:01.927
Oh, on TV.
Well, anything can happen on TV.

43:04.799 --> 43:06.366
'The question is'

43:06.453 --> 43:08.542
'where have you seen that
done in real life?'

43:16.115 --> 43:19.205
[instrumental music]

43:19.292 --> 43:21.729
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.
