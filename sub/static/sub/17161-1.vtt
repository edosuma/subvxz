He climbed up on the headline  here to do?

01:16.837 --> 01:18.194

regulations there. Now.

01:21.911 --> 01:23.928

But do not turn malicious.

01:33.458 --> 01:34.236

Now, add little more.

02:00.068 --> 02:01.186
Okay, okay.

Alright. The last container.

02:03.704 --> 02:06.460

02:18.168 --> 02:20.764
First, do not call me "Lady".
Second, this is not "crates".

02:20.924 --> 02:23.600
This is the shipment of
humanitarian relief flood zone...

02:23.641 --> 02:24.959
... And toys for children
in the orphanage.

02:25.040 --> 02:27.236
These are all people in the region
due to voluntary donations there.

02:27.277 --> 02:28.255
What other cars that?

02:28.516 --> 02:30.433

03:49.185 --> 03:51.741
I have asked that a
little gentle glide.

03:52.181 --> 03:53.938
Be careful not to spoil
some cars there.

03:53.979 --> 03:55.656
The storm this big one

03:55.737 --> 03:57.654

03:57.655 --> 04:00.531
- Must try to overcome the storm.
- Then try that pass away.

04:00.572 --> 04:03.807
Chec Several heavy vehicles too. Overload
6 tonnes so hard to control the aircraft.

04:03.848 --> 04:06.164
What are you saying?
Here one is commanding you?

04:06.205 --> 04:09.321

map this stuff away.

04:15.395 --> 04:16.753
There, the victims,
children are...

04:16.793 --> 04:19.909
I'm sure threw away.
It will carry other items to them. This is the command.

04:58.506 --> 04:59.944
Hey, soldier.

05:00.864 --> 05:02.541
Listen to the orders of the commander.

05:03.381 --> 05:06.137

- Take. Now it's time to get lucky here.

05:09.933 --> 05:12.090
This weather we would
have known to bite.

05:22.719 --> 05:25.035
I have to say that, Vodka dom.

05:26.719 --> 05:38.035
Sub: thanh2h @ subteam

05:39.900 --> 05:41.377
Who inserted these
things here do not know.

05:42.217 --> 05:43.614
Gushin, hear that?

05:45.453 --> 05:47.770
Bring key transferred
to property manager.

05:48.330 --> 05:49.408
Do not forget it.

05:51.207 --> 05:52.564
Hey, Lyosha Lyosha is dear.

05:52.965 --> 05:54.442
You're the type who likes rebelling.

05:56.281 --> 05:58.877
Yes, that guy is stupid right,
but not the general public, too.

05:59.078 --> 06:01.274
Now what?
He enraged so rather useless?

06:01.315 --> 06:02.753
Sanhya, if he is, he can do it?

06:03.033 --> 06:04.051
Do Well done.

06:05.231 --> 06:07.547
Yes very much. The stubbornness
is happy Monday. Just do it.

06:08.347 --> 06:11.383
Now with that decision, the sowing
to his plane and was driven rolls.

06:11.624 --> 06:13.021
You're certain to defeat me?

06:13.701 --> 06:14.639
Thank you.

06:19.655 --> 06:20.633
This Lyosha...

06:21.652 --> 06:22.970
He was an excellent pilot.

06:24.289 --> 06:26.446
Missing sky, he will not survive anywhere
. Dead sure.

06:26.567 --> 06:27.585
Do you understand?

06:29.044 --> 06:30.302
Everything will be all right then.

06:31.561 --> 06:33.398
I suggest you
again, see his dad.

06:33.599 --> 06:35.855
Let's have him help.
Why are you so stupid and stubborn?

06:36.196 --> 06:38.872
I really do not understand. Yes
father why he kept such that alienate him?

06:38.953 --> 06:40.270
Just let him arrange for him.

06:40.391 --> 06:42.228
I repeat again, there's
no way I ask him.

06:42.389 --> 06:43.187
Back pride wind blowing huh?

06:43.228 --> 06:45.265
Where He does not arrange.
He's not that kind of person.

06:45.425 --> 06:46.603
What are you doing now?

06:48.942 --> 06:50.099
Temporarily undecided.

06:55.174 --> 06:55.893
Lyosha.

06:58.011 --> 07:00.048
I know they want to pursue the servant.

07:01.248 --> 07:03.644
- Thank you got all of them.
- Forget it.

07:06.122 --> 07:09.038
Lyosha, go to Moscow to go.
Ask your dad for help.

07:09.918 --> 07:10.936
None.

07:19.587 --> 07:20.665
Sorry.

08:04.736 --> 08:08.131
- Book How's dad?
- Tam Tam.

08:09.650 --> 08:12.206
Why not write on the computer announced?
It can be easily removed if the wrong type.

08:13.046 --> 08:16.162
Habit of erasing only for those
who do not normally mind.

08:18.321 --> 08:21.676
"Memoirs of the last aircraft".
The name or absolute.

08:24.753 --> 08:26.191
Dad, I do not stay home long.

08:26.391 --> 08:29.467
I'll find a job.
Renting accommodations and do something.

08:29.548 --> 08:31.585
- To find something?
- Lack declared what the huh?

08:32.984 --> 08:34.621
I know it, I know that potatoes.

08:34.702 --> 08:36.239
Why? From the sky falls a straight
down towards the kitchen, huh?

08:38.857 --> 08:39.775
I did not intentionally.

08:39.816 --> 08:42.013
Expelled from Border
nor intentional.

08:42.493 --> 08:43.931
Expelled from Air Force, too.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.928
Now expelled from the
Air Force transport.

08:46.409 --> 08:48.126
It is not intentional, huh?

09:06.146 --> 09:10.181
He was General Manager of the
youngest airlines, right?

09:11.021 --> 09:13.817
Welcome, comrades.
I am Gushin here.

09:14.737 --> 09:15.854
Listen.

09:17.134 --> 09:19.071
It is hiring pilots guys right?

09:21.130 --> 09:23.286
There are people who
are interested in it.

09:24.166 --> 09:26.443
As distant cousins... They.

09:27.362 --> 09:29.739
This guy has certified about
a little bad behavior.

09:30.479 --> 09:31.757
Eye on you for help.

09:32.077 --> 09:34.374
Of course, a
general-interest alone.

09:34.794 --> 09:38.309
OK. There's something wrong, you
keep chasing straight neck.

09:38.350 --> 09:41.745
Need anything call me, I'm
still alive wrinkle here.

09:42.306 --> 09:43.383
Being. Goodbye.

09:44.303 --> 09:45.661
Okay. Followed by the order
in which arrangements.

09:45.742 --> 09:48.218
The airline
is small but very reliable.

09:48.299 --> 09:50.655
There will be examinations at the
airport, at the training center.

09:50.736 --> 09:53.212
All airlines are trained there.

09:53.373 --> 09:55.570
So what's the cause that they
know all the galaxy's desk.

09:55.611 --> 09:56.409
Dad, thank you.

09:56.450 --> 10:00.764
Temporarily forgetting try some other
people the idea of their children, okay?

10:03.282 --> 10:04.519
As any money?

10:05.280 --> 10:08.275
- Also, please.
- Open cabinet that took more away.

10:11.193 --> 10:12.031
The key here.

10:21.262 --> 10:22.359
Please listen to me.

10:22.380 --> 10:24.378
The conversation continues,
there is no effect.

10:24.558 --> 10:25.716
He killed me there, you know?

10:25.936 --> 10:28.093
I did not kill him.
I just wrote that...

10:28.094 --> 10:30.490
... I can not do
pilots in our company.

10:30.491 --> 10:31.929
Yes. He just sat here
and said Cavalier.

10:31.930 --> 10:34.386
Only he pilots the
new value is, huh?

10:34.686 --> 10:35.744
Please give through.

10:36.404 --> 10:38.681
No one gets through floating rounds
of competition in that his pilots.

10:39.641 --> 10:41.358
matter what he reasonable?

10:43.197 --> 10:44.754
It's possible I have a problem.

10:45.314 --> 10:46.892
But I can not be certain to reach the firm...

10:46.992 --> 10:51.187
... The mood swings, lack
of autonomy and sloppy.

10:51.348 --> 10:52.625
That's what I'm doing.

10:53.066 --> 10:54.583
Hello there, boys.

11:21.593 --> 11:23.031
This problem solved very simply.

11:23.072 --> 11:25.028
Just termination of
employment are some who? M...

11:25.069 --> 11:26.247
Hello Mr.

11:27.387 --> 11:28.864
Why are you late?

11:29.704 --> 11:32.500
- Sorry, I got lost.
- With passenger he answered that, huh?

11:32.581 --> 11:33.898
Okay.
Take this paper.

11:37.376 --> 11:39.372
How did such bad behavior?

11:39.613 --> 11:41.929
We will comment later.
Now on exercise equipment.

11:53.278 --> 11:57.951
Come on. Last takeoff norm.
Favorable meteorological conditions. Start.

12:17.091 --> 12:19.467
As already folded.
Flaps open angle of 0.

12:19.608 --> 12:20.646
True.

12:24.322 --> 12:25.360
Mikhail Palych.

12:25.801 --> 12:29.436
More cloudy and turbulent
air at the average level.

12:38.666 --> 12:42.421
You should upgrade to the altitude in steps
of 160, it will be less than the vibration.

12:42.782 --> 12:45.557
- Hear me?
- Yes, yes. For me, making this one better.

13:01.441 --> 13:02.858
- Is circling.
- Very pretty.

13:04.677 --> 13:07.033
Mikhail Palych. Increased slightly again.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.738
The engine must.

13:25.174 --> 13:27.171
Ignition engines.
Please allow landing.

13:27.531 --> 13:29.508
I am the nearest airport.

13:44.272 --> 13:45.450
Mikhail Palych.

13:49.426 --> 13:53.361
Outdoor temperatures: -5. Runway
length: 800. Wind from the stern.

13:53.701 --> 13:56.697
Leonid Savych, a bit too much?

14:07.566 --> 14:10.442
Brakes back. Emergency braking.
The runway is too short.

14:27.024 --> 14:29.620
He landed it?
I just judged by the fact.

14:29.701 --> 14:32.177
Type like military pilot planes destroyed.
And then what happens?

14:32.218 --> 14:33.495
He drove very pretty.

14:33.576 --> 14:36.892
He deliberately missed because
he can not speak his discretion.

14:36.973 --> 14:40.088
- Myakinsky?
- As always, absent.

14:41.008 --> 14:42.965
- Pilots Gavrylyuk?
- Neck.

14:43.645 --> 14:45.842
- Pilots Burymenko?
- Neck.

14:46.442 --> 14:48.558
- Pilots Shapovalov?
- Yes

14:48.959 --> 14:50.636
- Pilots Prokhorov?
- Neck.

14:51.037 --> 14:52.314
Prokhorov, a trough
practice areas.

14:52.595 --> 14:56.110
We have principles, rules, relations
on the bottom must comply.

14:56.750 --> 14:59.226
Furthermore, certified his
conduct can not worse.

14:59.387 --> 15:00.944
So, you do not need
to protect him.

15:00.945 --> 15:02.343
I'm not protecting anyone.

15:02.624 --> 15:05.379
There are, in such case, the
landing can not be, even...

15:06.299 --> 15:07.018
... Including him.

15:07.378 --> 15:08.776
No one was able to land.

15:12.053 --> 15:13.131
Okay.

15:14.690 --> 15:15.668
Cam help me.

15:16.768 --> 15:18.445
He reset true situation goes.

15:28.514 --> 15:30.951
- You do that for?
- Car of me?

15:31.751 --> 15:33.827
Perhaps not.
Looks like it's me out?

15:34.188 --> 15:36.105
Do not know the guy
Rhino to the car here?

15:36.146 --> 15:39.041
- Sorry, she told anybody?
- Women never to such vehicles.

15:39.502 --> 15:42.498
Surely pilots a certain guy, really
do not understand what kind anymore.

15:42.658 --> 15:43.576
Give me the car keys.

15:44.456 --> 15:47.212
- What To Do?
- I try to fly over and see the stars.

15:47.573 --> 15:49.210
- Give it to me.
- You're a pilot?

15:49.291 --> 15:50.249
Cam help me.

16:20.855 --> 16:21.853
Thank you.

16:25.210 --> 16:26.228
Give her.

16:27.088 --> 16:27.926
The key?

16:29.925 --> 16:30.683
I am Lyosha.

16:31.523 --> 16:32.681
Alesandra.

16:33.401 --> 16:35.478
Alesandra. Does she...

16:36.238 --> 16:37.835
... Can take me out
the subway station?

17:05.484 --> 17:06.682
Leonid Savych.

17:07.482 --> 17:09.559
He must also sign the
minutes of examination.

17:14.874 --> 17:17.430
Why so pensive that he pilots?

17:18.070 --> 17:19.088
Former .

17:19.549 --> 17:22.025
As a former pilot. Today
I have failed miserably.

17:22.825 --> 17:23.903
2 points huh?

17:24.383 --> 17:27.539
None. I want to assure my master
degree, no doubt off minutes.

17:27.700 --> 17:30.056
- Supposed to be smarter.
- Really?

17:32.494 --> 17:33.532
What does she do?

17:33.573 --> 17:35.210
Of course not such
nonessential things.

17:35.251 --> 17:36.289
Bay that silly game?

17:36.290 --> 17:38.327
Arguing with the
judges is silly.

17:38.368 --> 17:40.165
It envied her confidence.

17:40.205 --> 17:43.001
So what is important to him than
flying or the "ego" of his?

17:43.122 --> 17:44.360
'I', it has nothing?

17:44.840 --> 17:46.597
Yes, the "I" of him that
I respected very much.

17:46.958 --> 17:48.976
"What I have to do.
I shall have nothing to do."

17:49.036 --> 17:51.472
"The new other than guilty."
Always so.

17:51.673 --> 17:52.710
Please pick up the phone to help.

17:52.851 --> 17:55.347
Hey, why are you getting so subjective?
Do you know anything about this at all!

17:55.388 --> 17:58.584
Then there anymore.
Of course, I do understand what?

17:58.824 --> 18:00.781
Maybe he thought, only he
had understood everything.

18:00.982 --> 18:02.060
- Who?
- Brother.

18:02.101 --> 18:03.019
- Hush.
- What?

18:03.020 --> 18:04.157
Will you please shut up the household.

18:05.337 --> 18:06.235
Yes.

18:07.255 --> 18:08.193
What?

18:11.530 --> 18:12.528
Yes. I will be there.

18:12.609 --> 18:13.807
Get the hell out of the car.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.005
Hooray.

18:58.877 --> 19:00.554
The cards tell you anything yet.

19:00.675 --> 19:03.430
All depends on you how
to prove themselves.

19:03.571 --> 19:05.828
You only probation, not
its official pilots.

19:06.108 --> 19:07.506
Truth takes time.

19:07.986 --> 19:11.701
You're subject to my command, must follow
all orders and instructions of expertise.

19:12.341 --> 19:15.976
After each flight, I would have to
submit reports on top of his status.

19:16.057 --> 19:18.973
Remember: I see everything,
if there is anything wrong...

19:19.234 --> 19:21.170
... The report will have on the
boss's desk, and "did not see you."

19:21.291 --> 19:22.769
- Clear?
- Thank you.

19:23.409 --> 19:25.525
Excuse me, on my plane when lifting
attitude is not proper height.

19:25.566 --> 19:29.920

19:29.961 --> 19:33.157

- Yes.

19:33.238 --> 19:34.655
- How are you?
- Stable sir.

19:34.796 --> 19:35.834

19:38.991 --> 19:40.668

19:43.147 --> 19:44.584
Calculation pretty much.

19:44.585 --> 19:46.542
I would suggest you go to
the Financial Department.

19:46.663 --> 19:47.780

20:18.187 --> 20:20.304

- Voronezh.

20:20.704 --> 20:22.581
- There I go Volgagrad.
- Congratulations.

20:22.702 --> 20:24.339
No, I mean we're going back to the same
hours and this is...

20:24.380 --> 20:25.258

20:25.259 --> 20:27.935
I will take a glass of it? She said the
restaurant "The Crane" right? "Cranes"?

20:29.095 --> 20:31.091
Thank you. The more I came to Voronezh.

20:32.131 --> 20:34.208
- Hey, she's a pilot?

20:34.249 --> 20:36.965
Girl standing in the pilot
area, named Alesandra.

20:37.325 --> 20:39.042
You came here to work
or do something, huh?

20:50.670 --> 20:51.688

21:14.523 --> 21:17.019
Or do the climb? Great,

21:17.120 --> 21:19.317
Andrey, I do not need excess
Adrenalne climbing wall.

21:34.061 --> 21:36.378

If you have something to
learn, come and see me.

21:42.012 --> 21:42.531
I understand.

21:42.572 --> 21:44.488
Andryusha, police department
let go, he was not the pilot.

21:44.489 --> 21:45.927
Sveta, I do not want
to become a pilot.

21:46.048 --> 21:49.203
In addition to the pilots, she
Victorya Sanna dislike anyone.

21:49.324 --> 21:50.681
So, thank God.

21:54.079 --> 21:55.915

22:07.344 --> 22:08.901
Flight 117 was
ready to take off.

22:09.421 --> 22:10.699
Flight 117 was
allowed to take off.

22:11.099 --> 22:12.337
Runway number 19.

22:12.498 --> 22:13.735
Joystick right.

22:15.135 --> 22:16.053
Takeoff go.

22:16.653 --> 22:17.931
Do not play tricks.

22:25.203 --> 22:26.401

22:27.960 --> 22:29.797
- 100. Speed

22:48.457 --> 22:49.735
Have more folds.

22:50.135 --> 22:51.533
Now cavalier home.

22:56.088 --> 22:59.044
Leonid Savych, okay?
Outside quite panicked passengers.

22:59.165 --> 23:01.561
- Fine.
- The girl, for 1 cup of black coffee.

23:01.962 --> 23:03.279
No sugar, and really special.

23:17.265 --> 23:18.063
Gushin.

23:19.981 --> 23:21.339
The first combat flight
pretty cool, right?

23:21.660 --> 23:22.937
Listen, boys.

23:24.017 --> 23:27.092
This is not combat but flight
passenger transport flights.

23:27.213 --> 23:29.410
On the plane was not
carrying commandos though...

23:29.531 --> 23:32.327
... Which is 200 people
are eager to return home.

23:32.887 --> 23:34.524
Do you understand that?

23:36.243 --> 23:38.200
Sorry, I drove a little higher.
But anyone die thus?

23:38.281 --> 23:40.118
Not allowed to say
so, even joking.

23:40.558 --> 23:42.195
Now listen very clearly here.

23:42.196 --> 23:46.151
The impromptu takeoff today I will
not be included in the report.

23:46.152 --> 23:48.069
But this is the first
and also the last.

23:48.230 --> 23:50.906
The again, do not allow
ridicule crew members.

23:50.946 --> 23:51.825
I sneered when?

23:51.985 --> 23:54.422
He told Andrey  What kind?
He is his teammate.

23:54.862 --> 23:56.299
Kidding. Stewards of the
profession are women.

23:56.380 --> 23:58.177
On the sun, any work
of man is nothing.

23:59.337 --> 24:00.854
He married you?

24:01.335 --> 24:04.131
Who?
Yes, then... well not yet.

24:05.290 --> 24:06.448
It was kind of a pilot "Kamikaze".

24:06.489 --> 24:08.526
The body is unable to keep,
while harming others.

24:09.605 --> 24:11.962
In short, Gushin, be
seriously draw lessons.

24:12.442 --> 24:13.800
I forewarned so that he knows.

24:20.873 --> 24:22.150
Allow to congratulate him.

24:35.017 --> 24:38.971
That's it. So two people angry,
turned against each other.

24:39.252 --> 24:42.128
Then suddenly she Svetka
rooms from 2 to drop by and say:

24:42.169 --> 24:44.125
"I just looked a very strange..."

24:44.446 --> 24:45.923
What? He asked why?

24:46.164 --> 24:48.081
What?
Did you say something, huh?

24:48.442 --> 24:49.320
No...

24:49.880 --> 24:52.476
You do not like you?
Let me take him meatballs.

24:53.716 --> 24:57.111
- At work there is something irritating you?
- He set the whole trouble.

24:57.232 --> 25:00.347
God, to issue apprenticeship.

25:00.588 --> 25:03.903
The price he was also interested
in the son so good right.

25:06.661 --> 25:08.178
In short, he was married or not?

25:09.937 --> 25:11.974
My family is still fine.

25:13.853 --> 25:16.409
Working husband, the wife, too.
The per son is useless.

25:16.450 --> 25:17.448
It's not useless.

25:18.248 --> 25:19.685
It's just less to meet him alone.

25:21.364 --> 25:22.242
Both you, too.

25:22.243 --> 25:23.621
- Hush.
- What's up?

25:26.159 --> 25:27.357
English how so?

25:46.096 --> 25:47.054
Valera.

25:48.254 --> 25:49.651
I crazy?

25:50.531 --> 25:52.248
Do you know his house on the 3rd floor it?

25:52.329 --> 25:53.927
- Normally only.
- Normally what?

25:53.928 --> 25:56.564
How many times have you
tell me, this house doors.

25:57.444 --> 25:59.760
Leaving that kind of climb over
the window, he somersaults.

26:00.680 --> 26:03.036
What if that fell from the balcony down to
determine who will pick up the baby, huh?

26:03.117 --> 26:04.594
- What is this?
- Oil?

26:04.675 --> 26:05.913
New tattoos, huh?

26:07.592 --> 26:09.709
- To prepare to prison life?
- May.

26:09.989 --> 26:11.906
So drink and smoke set off.

26:12.227 --> 26:14.144
The no alcohol, no drugs.
You are followers of "Straight edge".

26:14.265 --> 26:15.862
- As who?
- Thank announced interest.

26:15.903 --> 26:19.418
- Is the matter with the English teacher?
- Friendships remain strong.

26:19.419 --> 26:20.656
Just Leu lies with your father away.

26:21.337 --> 26:25.291
- When are you going to test again?
- Unknown.

26:25.372 --> 26:27.489
- So who knows?
- I do not do certain lawyers.

26:27.490 --> 26:28.967
I'll arrange for you
to fly courses.

26:29.088 --> 26:33.042
For a man like father, right?
The guy clobbered as a taxi driver.

26:33.123 --> 26:35.559
- You say?
- Come on. As for you, go to sleep.

26:35.640 --> 26:37.477
It was impossible to
speak normally with it.

26:37.518 --> 26:38.157
Dad tried yet?

26:38.637 --> 26:42.671
Valera. I forbade you must not
lock the door. Listen not you?

26:46.069 --> 26:47.106
I heard then.

26:47.787 --> 26:50.463
I forbid you are not
allowed to lock the door.

26:51.842 --> 26:52.960
You Understand?

26:54.299 --> 26:56.576
And never been in front of me slammed the door.

26:56.617 --> 26:57.814
Sleep, son.

27:10.161 --> 27:12.038
- Oh, greeted her, Lena.
- Hello, Leonid Savych.

27:12.039 --> 27:13.616
I need to see her.
You wait.

27:14.556 --> 27:15.634
Lena  this.

27:16.674 --> 27:19.949
There is a pretty dull boy
needs to learn English.

27:20.190 --> 27:22.426
- This means that need tutoring?
- Right.

27:22.747 --> 27:24.904
I'm happy, but generally
do not receive tutoring.

27:24.905 --> 27:26.901
Lena, I earnestly ask her that.

27:28.700 --> 27:29.618
Relatives of me?

27:29.619 --> 27:31.097
Do not just relatives.

27:31.218 --> 27:34.253

do not have time to meet.

27:50.516 --> 27:51.594
How Unified offline.

28:46.932 --> 28:51.446
Who allows him to give training
sessions on emergency training?

28:51.447 --> 28:54.163
If you do not turn off the machine, I was able
landing. Only a little more...

28:54.164 --> 28:58.118

29:41.510 --> 29:45.705
<i>Flight 117 was allowed to land.

Do you understand what I have done?

30:43.400 --> 30:44.498
Sorry.

30:48.355 --> 30:49.672
Maybe I got it wrong.

30:53.988 --> 30:55.506

30:55.507 --> 30:57.663
Right now, the entire planet
Coordination Unit are tangled up.

30:58.383 --> 30:59.621
Fog terrible  true, right?

30:59.902 --> 31:01.779
Dense fog, if not control him...

31:01.780 --> 31:03.377

31:08.732 --> 31:10.748

31:10.829 --> 31:12.846
Do not understand it, so

Seeing what?

31:14.885 --> 31:16.722

what had happened.

31:26.632 --> 31:28.189

Twenty one.

32:05.827 --> 32:07.265
Yes.

32:09.183 --> 32:12.499
I see. So he was in the Army in being
disciplined for whatever reason?

32:12.979 --> 32:15.535
There is also a service.
The aircraft encountered a problem and severely damaged.

32:15.896 --> 32:17.813
We, horrible, almost fell.

32:18.333 --> 32:21.169
In the bay there are hundreds of soldiers
and around the airport there is not any.

32:21.210 --> 32:23.007
We still fly, but
they can not land.

32:23.048 --> 32:25.604
Besides those other aircraft,
but they can not do anything.

32:25.765 --> 32:28.960
Helpless feeling overwhelmed, but still
try to fly, and finally to be home.

32:28.961 --> 32:30.438
- It's too lucky.
- Right.

32:30.599 --> 32:33.695
And I was betting with a key
he and one crazy adventure.

32:33.955 --> 32:36.412
He bragged to what
to do if it repeats.

32:36.632 --> 32:38.829
He tells, in a foreign country
has a flywheel acrobatics...

32:38.830 --> 32:41.506
... Can from the plane to the
other aircraft in mid-air.

32:41.747 --> 32:42.665
It has been calculated...

32:42.945 --> 32:46.061
... Need to fly with the speed how much,
how high, what should have facilities...

32:46.182 --> 32:47.979
Of course, as my father says,
it's just a fabulous idea.

32:47.980 --> 32:49.657
But we still decided to try.

32:50.177 --> 32:53.412
Finally, detection Command and
the work being done um up.

32:54.213 --> 32:56.709
They closed the laboratory,
the boy reprimanded...

32:57.449 --> 32:59.286
... And I was kind of army.

32:59.367 --> 33:01.284
- Unfortunately.
- I often encounter such bad luck.

33:02.203 --> 33:04.480
Until now I still can not distinguish
well what to do, what not.

33:05.999 --> 33:08.755
Knowing that will meet
but still plagues input stabbed.

33:09.116 --> 33:11.392
Zinchenko also clashes
with that, I feel...

33:11.992 --> 33:14.788
... Like so students are repeaters.
- It's not the right perspective.

33:16.308 --> 33:18.864
Back then the world
is not for the good.

33:19.264 --> 33:20.781
Which in my opinion, you're such a good person.

33:21.861 --> 33:26.495
You are the one that good. Only thing
I did not know how to reach you.

33:26.576 --> 33:28.213

and beat him again.

33:28.214 --> 33:31.090
I really do not understand, he wanted
someone questioned me about you?

34:09.607 --> 34:11.085
Oh, you are so beautiful.

34:13.123 --> 34:16.159
You are the most beautiful
female pilot a worldly.

34:19.396 --> 34:21.393
The pilot is a very hard job.

34:24.351 --> 34:27.666
You know, as a female
pilot is how not.

34:29.145 --> 34:31.222
Must try to overcome
so many obstacles.

34:34.100 --> 34:36.616
You always have to try
to double the others...

34:36.617 --> 34:38.733
... To get people to recognize.

34:39.572 --> 34:41.130
If not will be eliminated immediately.

34:42.770 --> 34:46.125
If pre-flight, she announced
via loudspeakers:

34:46.565 --> 34:50.320
"Hello your guests, I was the number
two Alesandra Kuzmina pilots".

34:51.998 --> 34:54.516
Immediately, your guests
will be the loud screaming:

34:55.196 --> 34:56.592
"Woman behind the need to drive it?".

34:56.754 --> 34:58.271
I know you see how not offended?

34:59.311 --> 35:02.347
Well, you and I will talk as the
two pilots in the pilot areas.

35:05.145 --> 35:08.420

35:29.637 --> 35:32.912
I want to tell you...

35:33.712 --> 35:35.429
Maybe I should not go
to his place again.

35:36.050 --> 35:37.147
His son... He Valera

35:37.148 --> 35:39.744
It is a gentle young man,
she do not be afraid.

35:39.945 --> 35:42.022

36:44.193 --> 36:45.990

36:50.306 --> 36:51.743
In the plane immediately, Vika.

37:10.882 --> 37:12.520
A coup, Vika.

37:13.719 --> 37:15.117
Will they make us
wait a long time?

37:15.158 --> 37:16.515
Silence. Coordinator hear it.

37:18.314 --> 37:19.711
They are checking the passengers.

37:20.631 --> 37:25.385

37:25.546 --> 37:26.524

Please read it.

38:39.223 --> 38:42.858
We are foreign citizens, so
not allowed to intervene.

Why instead of acting, he
just said the complaint?

40:21.427 --> 40:24.383
You should have stopped the plane again.
Does it matter where?

40:25.103 --> 40:28.618

49:19.250 --> 49:22.040
But maybe... just because
his older brother...

49:52.875 --> 49:54.874
After all, he has to
be at the helm or not?

49:55.083 --> 49:57.624
How could you leave that
kid to the cockpit.

49:57.833 --> 49:59.582
Now everything was scoured
up on the website.

49:59.583 --> 50:02.207
Back also major shareholders as
well as one of us on the flight.

50:02.458 --> 50:05.574
I'm just on the Department of.
At that people keep on attacking spark.

50:05.758 --> 50:07.374
Have a tough time to escape.

50:07.416 --> 50:09.874
- Should I chase you not here?
- He chased me away.

50:10.875 --> 50:12.457
What?

50:17.541 --> 50:18.874
He reiterated go.

50:19.208 --> 50:20.707
I will not regret it.

50:21.333 --> 50:23.290
On the other hand, I
rather admire that boy.

50:23.291 --> 50:25.624
It has taught me is to
sit in the cockpit.

50:26.291 --> 50:29.874
Being insulted, not controversy.
Being spit in his face, suffered.

50:30.175 --> 50:33.165
That to me should not be listed here, but
this must be addressed here directly.

50:34.083 --> 50:35.165
Fear of everything...

50:35.333 --> 50:39.274
... Write diary that ball to fly for anyone...
- To me it all so well.

50:39.875 --> 50:41.874
Can not help it, have patience.

50:42.075 --> 50:43.190
I am very patience here.

50:43.275 --> 50:45.290
But he does not endure.
Because he's doing the right thing.

50:45.333 --> 50:48.599
You should do so that the guy
said he was "a good man" that...

50:48.733 --> 50:50.099
... Become a normal person go.

50:50.500 --> 50:53.915
Now, there are some people from
Asia were inclusive plane.

50:54.416 --> 50:58.499
Even today leaves. The crew has been
selected. He will be the captain.

50:58.500 --> 51:00.124
This trip will be approximately 1  months.

51:00.125 --> 51:02.124
Then this case will certainly finished.

51:02.375 --> 51:05.074
Select grab a deal to
make engines anytime...

51:05.275 --> 51:06.874
... Also can take turns driving.

51:06.875 --> 51:09.499
What forced the other
line guy fired.

51:09.500 --> 51:11.082
None. Can not be dismissed.

51:12.958 --> 51:14.290
I do not understand?

51:14.458 --> 51:16.290
Can not chase him.

51:17.833 --> 51:19.707
So what is it? Son you?

51:20.166 --> 51:23.957
Not my son. But he
is a born pilot.

51:24.375 --> 51:26.999
My hands were just hands,
but his wings are.

51:27.083 --> 51:29.557
The controlled manipulation
of him I could not do it.

51:29.758 --> 51:32.957
So, thank you for trusting me,
but without him, I do not drive.

51:33.458 --> 51:35.882
<i>Passengers attention.
Train departure preparation.</i>

51:35.925 --> 51:41.074
<i>Please do not smoke in the carriages. Expect your guests
sympathy. Thank you.</i>

51:46.000 --> 51:48.582
Why do not you
listen to my phone.

51:49.083 --> 51:51.082
And who allows him to
hold the instrument.

51:51.375 --> 51:52.999
You ask what to do?

51:53.208 --> 51:57.207
<i>Passengers noticed, by the door was about to close.
Next station...</i>

51:57.500 --> 51:59.207
Leonid Savych.

51:59.500 --> 52:01.749
Leonid Savych.
Why are you taking my things?

52:01.750 --> 52:03.749
Enough already. I do not come back.
I suffered enough.

52:18.208 --> 52:20.874
I'm tired, understand?
I'm too tired.

52:26.208 --> 52:27.874
Saying all that yet?

52:29.708 --> 52:30.732
Of it this way.

52:30.908 --> 52:33.832
To fly or not to fly
again as his own work.

52:33.875 --> 52:36.874
Do what you want to do,
where to go, then go.

52:37.125 --> 52:37.949
But...

52:38.041 --> 52:40.290
What type ... first of all he
must also complete this flight.

52:40.291 --> 52:42.290
Since there are a fool
praised him profusely.

52:43.666 --> 52:45.040
Be prepared to fly.

52:46.083 --> 52:47.749
Idiot are you?

52:48.125 --> 52:51.290
Yourself to find out.
About rooms away.

52:54.166 --> 52:56.949
He decided, let it go with you.

52:57.500 --> 53:00.540
What about the payment of testing?
It would be driven away.

53:00.541 --> 53:02.124
After 1 month it will retest.

53:02.125 --> 53:04.499
Then its English skills will better
because the whole they speak English.

53:04.666 --> 53:07.832
It probably should not.
What if "fire lesson plans", why?

53:07.833 --> 53:09.874
Is bad things that you have to
catch a taxi to come here always.

53:10.541 --> 53:11.915
By both his stockings
and forgotten.

53:12.375 --> 53:13.624
I'll buy it.

53:13.625 --> 53:15.290
It is, but do not forget it.

53:16.166 --> 53:18.207
- Why did this makeup?
- What?

53:18.208 --> 53:19.499
Where are you going?

53:20.208 --> 53:25.374
I? Ever you... you go do not they.
Always that.

53:26.041 --> 53:28.282
- Always you?
- Every day too.

53:29.375 --> 53:30.399
Does it matter why?

53:31.916 --> 53:33.999
- Why are you...
- Mau leave the area right away.

53:34.750 --> 53:36.874
But he let it go with him to do?

53:36.875 --> 53:38.957
Along with his 1-month, the
airline had any effect?

53:39.166 --> 53:41.832
Or leave it alone at home
studying, I'll keep an eye on it.

53:41.833 --> 53:43.832
But this does not make sense.

53:45.125 --> 53:48.474
Valera. Stop it, you hear?
Mother said, I stopped.

53:49.041 --> 53:50.332
Can not human like you?

53:50.333 --> 53:52.032
- I love you, son.
- Yes Yes.

53:52.333 --> 53:52.990
Goodbye.

53:53.166 --> 53:55.624
Bye, Honey.

53:56.708 --> 53:59.832
Do not forget to return the paper to fall into place.

54:02.500 --> 54:03.915
Remember to buy stockings offline.

54:07.375 --> 54:09.749
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

54:17.375 --> 54:20.040
Gushin, let's work offline.

54:20.416 --> 54:22.790
This is the second pilot of us.

54:24.041 --> 54:26.540
In the coming months,
we will fly together.

54:26.541 --> 54:28.540
In the same crew.

54:30.083 --> 54:33.832
Preparing to take off.
Ca 1 is Kuzmina, ca 2 is Gushin.

54:44.125 --> 54:45.415
- Hello.
- Hello.

54:45.416 --> 54:47.415
Dad, you here, okay?

54:47.458 --> 54:50.332
Outsiders are not
allowed in the cockpit.

54:51.333 --> 54:53.832
Get out passenger compartment.
Cam belongings.

54:56.125 --> 54:58.207
And taunting the attendant ban.

55:07.666 --> 55:11.249
- He intentionally?
- What?

55:11.333 --> 55:13.874
- You deliberately put me in?
- Intentionally there.

55:13.875 --> 55:16.999
I heard that her actions
are very flexible.

55:17.166 --> 55:19.415
Preparing to take off, Xasha.

55:47.625 --> 55:54.124
Gushin. Gushin.
Call him Captain.

56:01.041 --> 56:05.082
Have not heard Kanwoo island?
A volcanic island in the north.

56:05.708 --> 56:10.165
There just happened earthquake,
now can still aftershocks.

56:10.375 --> 56:13.249
There needs help to put the
elderly and the injured to leave.

56:13.250 --> 56:15.907
I'm close to where it is, moreover
is empty and fuel remaining.

56:16.033 --> 56:18.665
Airlines allows us to decide.

56:19.125 --> 56:20.707
I go.

56:25.125 --> 56:28.749
117 here. We diverted,
Kanwoo fly to the island.

56:29.333 --> 56:33.082
- 117, we are afraid not to be.
- Okay.

56:33.083 --> 56:36.040
- Please allow receiving driver.
- Do not.

56:37.291 --> 56:40.874
Airport there are very small, the
landing will be very difficult.

56:41.041 --> 56:44.957
- So?
- Kuzmina have more experience.

58:27.958 --> 58:31.999
Victor Nicolayevich. Victor Nicolayevich.
Please do stop already.

58:32.000 --> 58:36.082
- I need to inject finish.
- Come on let's go.

58:37.000 --> 58:37.999
- Hello.
- Hello.

58:38.375 --> 58:40.290
The truth is he good here too.
Very good.

58:40.750 --> 58:45.415
Please help put these employees, women and children
go. There are people injured.

58:45.416 --> 58:47.249
It will also add a few
more trips to now.

58:47.250 --> 58:49.249
Try to put away as much as possible.
Okay?

58:49.333 --> 58:51.457
- So, why the indigenous people?
- There is no native speakers.

58:51.458 --> 58:54.374
The mineral mining
work in each shift

58:57.583 --> 58:58.665
- Hi guys.
- Hello.

58:58.666 --> 59:00.457
- A Russian plane?
- Well, of Russia.

59:00.458 --> 59:03.124
- He will give us the go?
- Course

59:03.125 --> 59:04.957
Right now we'll
bring people on board.

59:04.958 --> 59:07.207
- No passport is not?
- Well, do not worry.

59:09.125 --> 59:11.832
Please ask, and he would
move the bodies go?

59:12.416 --> 59:13.749
What body?

59:14.000 --> 59:16.707
Then... people in distress.
There are many people died.

59:16.875 --> 59:19.374
We keep these people
alive already.

59:19.833 --> 59:20.999
Forecast how the situation?

59:21.000 --> 59:24.749
It all can happen, you see.
Everything is possible, I do not know.

59:24.750 --> 59:25.957
So who knows?

59:25.958 --> 59:29.224
Volcano eruption will certainly,
but when and for how long...

59:29.358 --> 59:30.624
... Nobody knows.

59:30.625 --> 59:33.249
Should quickly take off only.
This is a volcano there, you know?

59:33.250 --> 59:34.974
Do not be impatient. Wait
until the bus would take off.

59:35.050 --> 59:36.874
Will come now only.
Maybe so.

59:36.966 --> 59:39.749
Perhaps you? So he can take
responsibility in this situation or not?

59:40.583 --> 59:42.874
Stop it, do not
yell at him again.

59:42.875 --> 59:45.040
He has undergone a shock.
His wife had just died.

59:45.125 --> 59:48.374
Victor Nicolayevich.
It is necessary there.

59:48.625 --> 59:49.957
This is a sedative.

59:50.416 --> 59:53.290
- I came to look at the operating room.
- Be right back offline.

59:54.416 --> 59:55.624
Xasha.

59:56.166 --> 59:59.957
- To see how hospitals.
- Yes.

01:00:23.791 --> 01:00:27.874
Excuse me, help me with.
My husband over there, he's injured.

01:00:27.875 --> 01:00:29.915
He could not sit.
Which should put him away again.

01:00:29.916 --> 01:00:31.915
She just helped put him on a plane.

01:03:06.541 --> 01:03:08.874
It's okay. Alright.

01:03:08.875 --> 01:03:10.457
Okay. Dont be afraid.

01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:17.582
Calm down, calm down.

01:03:17.583 --> 01:03:19.582
I have said before, yet quiet.

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:23.499
Hurry. Going in this direction, this direction.

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.207
Oh, Oh my God.

01:03:26.208 --> 01:03:28.665
What are you doing?
Mau run away. Run.

01:03:28.666 --> 01:03:31.082
I can not. I can not

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:53.457
Where are you parents?

01:03:53.625 --> 01:03:55.749
Help! Help me!

01:04:15.125 --> 01:04:18.207
This is my son. Thank you.

01:04:19.166 --> 01:04:21.624
Get down to me to put out the fire.

01:04:24.958 --> 01:04:27.249
Okay, okay.

01:04:46.083 --> 01:04:47.582
Xasha.

01:04:48.291 --> 01:04:50.874
Clutching his shoulder.

01:04:51.875 --> 01:04:55.790
- Xasha, are you okay?
- I'm OK.

01:04:55.791 --> 01:04:58.540
- Come on, let's get back on air.
- Necessary to help these people.

01:04:58.541 --> 01:05:00.124
- Hurry up.
- Let's go.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.290
Do not be afraid.
People do not panic.

01:05:08.166 --> 01:05:12.082
Calm down, calm down.
All public calm.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.707
Valera. Zinchenko.
Over here yet.

01:05:30.583 --> 01:05:33.040
Everyone please note
sound of my voice.

01:05:33.833 --> 01:05:35.457
Stay calm.

01:05:36.041 --> 01:05:37.915
Do not leave...

01:05:37.916 --> 01:05:40.165
Do not leave the plane...

01:05:40.458 --> 01:05:42.040
... And do not panic.

01:05:42.041 --> 01:05:45.165
After a few minutes, when allowed...

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:47.249
... I will notice and everyone
will be on the plane.

01:05:47.666 --> 01:05:49.290
We will take off.

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:58.232
- Gushin, see Valera is?
- He's there.

01:05:58.300 --> 01:05:59.032
Valera  Where?

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:03.249
Upcoming then, carry on.

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.149
Let me help.

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:07.749
Valera, children over here.

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.649
Dad told me before that.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.049
Do not leave the
aircraft stairs.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.049
Okay. Now we're going
to leave here.

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:19.299
Not okay. I was informed that
the main runway was destroyed.

01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:23.299
We need to call the support from the mainland,
but have to wait until tomorrow morning.

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:29.299
So, why there? After that the lake?
Party shall not be a runway star?

01:06:30.041 --> 01:06:31.257
Have you seen how there already.

01:06:31.375 --> 01:06:35.482
A sea of fire. Burning fuel.
The fuel depot exploded then.

01:06:36.083 --> 01:06:38.632
Course after unburnt fuel,
they may try to take off.

01:06:38.833 --> 01:06:41.082
But the runway was too short,
only for small aircraft.

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:43.207
Which of his plane, it
was too heavy already.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.507
It even rolls up gearing.

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.307
Finally, the bus came.

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:58.307
Go here. I'm here. Hurry up.

01:07:00.258 --> 01:07:01.265
Valera.

01:07:01.458 --> 01:07:02.665
Leonid Savych.

01:07:02.666 --> 01:07:05.582
Let's step back a bit from the stairs.
Calm down.

01:07:05.583 --> 01:07:08.332
Do not worry. All of
them will be gone.

01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:11.999
Or we try try to put out the
fire in the 2nd runway away.

01:07:12.333 --> 01:07:14.207
There the water tower, you see?

01:07:14.208 --> 01:07:16.774
So? Anyway is not enough
length. I will pilot immediately into the sea.

01:07:16.875 --> 01:07:18.874
- What to do?
- Currently unknown.

01:07:24.108 --> 01:07:25.057
Valera.

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:26.957
I have to go?

01:07:26.958 --> 01:07:28.874
Go to the other aircraft stairs.

01:07:32.416 --> 01:07:34.540
- Who is the commander here? Honey?
- No.

01:07:34.541 --> 01:07:36.540
- So Where is the commander?
- He was there.

01:07:36.541 --> 01:07:39.124
He commanded, please stop.

01:07:39.125 --> 01:07:42.415
Hello. I am Margarita.
We have to go back.

01:07:42.416 --> 01:07:45.149
My sister
the kids and a lot of people are on the other side.

01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:46.040
In place?

01:07:46.041 --> 01:07:48.540
Party. Both the bus anymore.
They are trapped there.

01:07:48.541 --> 01:07:50.457
I told her the same goes...

01:07:50.458 --> 01:07:52.457
... But she does not listen.

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:53.957
I told you to come with me...

01:07:53.958 --> 01:07:56.790
... But her children are
too young, she's...

01:07:57.375 --> 01:07:59.499
Leonid Savych. When will
the people on the plane.

01:07:59.666 --> 01:08:01.207
Wait a moment.
There are not yet possible.

01:08:01.791 --> 01:08:03.415
I do not know what to do anymore.

01:08:03.416 --> 01:08:05.124
I told the driver back...

01:08:05.125 --> 01:08:06.207
... But they say that the avalanche and mountain.

01:08:06.208 --> 01:08:07.832
If small cars there?

01:08:07.833 --> 01:08:09.582
Of course, we can try...

01:08:09.583 --> 01:08:12.457
... But inside it was up to 30
people, a car is not enough.

01:08:12.541 --> 01:08:14.874
- Let me go.
- No. Do not.

01:08:14.875 --> 01:08:17.249
Anyway, I still can not fly.
I will be back soon enough.

01:08:17.582 --> 01:08:20.582
Listen. He is a pilot, his job is to fly.
Please stay here.

01:08:20.582 --> 01:08:24.024
Just like in Africa?
We flew away, leaving them to stay?

01:08:24.383 --> 01:08:28.124
In general, why do so?
I will return shortly.

01:08:31.625 --> 01:08:33.832
- Let me go with him, I know...
- I find it. Back plane.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.082
I stay here. Jobs in that
it does not need me.

01:08:37.416 --> 01:08:39.082
This is the work of adults.

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:42.124
I am not a child of 7?

01:08:47.166 --> 01:08:48.524
Leonid Savych. Leonid Savych.

01:08:48.666 --> 01:08:51.124
A
himself he can not put everyone on it.

01:08:51.166 --> 01:08:52.749
Please allow me to go with him.

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:58.457
- Andrey, keep an eye on the boy helped me.

01:09:45.291 --> 01:09:47.040

01:09:47.166 --> 01:09:48.215
What's going on?

01:09:50.316 --> 01:09:51.290
In the village you?

01:09:51.291 --> 01:09:53.624
No, in the upper village.

01:09:53.707 --> 01:09:55.957
- What's on it?
- Mining plant.

01:09:56.375 --> 01:09:57.332
Must leave here.

01:09:57.583 --> 01:09:59.874
Do not be afraid.
Mine much scarier.

01:09:59.875 --> 01:10:01.874
Probably still working.
Lamps still light there.

01:10:19.583 --> 01:10:22.165
What's going on? Why not
let us on the plane?

01:10:22.166 --> 01:10:24.007
Everyone please be patient.

01:10:24.708 --> 01:10:27.165
Runway broken, now
we can not take off.

01:10:34.475 --> 01:10:36.090
- Where are you going?
- Which is the boarding party. Go.

01:10:36.151 --> 01:10:37.765

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:47.290
We need to stop flying,
you understand?

01:10:47.291 --> 01:10:50.290
- There are planes there.
- Calm down, then we'll fly alone.

01:10:54.458 --> 01:10:57.249

- On the plane there.

01:10:57.250 --> 01:10:58.874

The runway is not long enough already.

01:11:44.683 --> 01:11:48.024
Save us.
We are here.

01:11:50.091 --> 01:11:51.007
Calm. She can speak Russian?

01:11:51.091 --> 01:11:52.107

In the bus. Car stuck then.
We can not reach it.

01:11:57.883 --> 01:11:59.857
Son. My son.

01:12:00.183 --> 01:12:03.582

01:12:27.625 --> 01:12:31.624
Follow me. Going into the goods.
Be careful.

01:12:32.208 --> 01:12:33.265
I'm here.

01:12:34.208 --> 01:12:36.165

01:12:36.958 --> 01:12:40.124
- Cow to go here.

Give me your hand. Pedal travel.

01:12:45.333 --> 01:12:47.290
Pedal  strong legs.

01:12:47.458 --> 01:12:50.665

- Come on. We can do this.

01:12:54.875 --> 01:12:57.624

01:13:04.333 --> 01:13:06.665
- Sao already.
- Radio reported the situation there is very bad.

01:13:06.666 --> 01:13:08.957
Lavas flowing very fast,
about to spread to here.

01:13:47.166 --> 01:13:50.207
Valera. Valera.

01:13:50.208 --> 01:13:51.957

01:14:37.958 --> 01:14:39.957
Be sure to fly.

01:14:40.791 --> 01:14:42.457
The pilot  Where?

01:14:42.458 --> 01:14:45.249
Die already. The entire crew.

01:14:45.875 --> 01:14:48.665
Road off of this
kind is very short.

01:14:48.666 --> 01:14:50.665
Another runway would be fine.

01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:52.999
If not, why?

01:15:08.083 --> 01:15:10.499
We have no choice.
Must leave now.

01:15:10.666 --> 01:15:12.665
We use this transport aircraft?

01:15:12.666 --> 01:15:15.374
Yes.
Be prepared to take passengers on the plane.

01:15:16.541 --> 01:15:19.790
When the car back, we'll take off.

01:15:43.875 --> 01:15:46.990

01:15:47.033 --> 01:15:47.999
Shut up.

Come on, hang on.

01:16:05.166 --> 01:16:06.415
Damn.

01:16:08.708 --> 01:16:11.874
- We're on fire.

01:16:17.583 --> 01:16:18.665

01:17:05.708 --> 01:17:08.124
Hurry, Andrey.

01:17:08.325 --> 01:17:10.040
Andrey. Go to the top of the
car and jump over it, hear it?

01:17:29.166 --> 01:17:31.207
- Alright? No what?

01:17:31.208 --> 01:17:33.499

Airport à other?

Anyone else who knows the
road to the airport is not?

01:17:46.791 --> 01:17:49.499
From here, go down

01:17:57.666 --> 01:18:01.999
Do not separated from the group.

01:18:12.166 --> 01:18:14.207
Vehicles returned yet?

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.040
Do not understand something?

01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:21.624
They have about which path to follow?

01:18:23.708 --> 01:18:26.290
There's nothing there anymore.
They are not on anymore.

01:18:26.291 --> 01:18:28.082
Sorry. Anyway, I must say.

01:18:28.083 --> 01:18:30.999
If after 5 minutes without
taking off, it is generally...

01:18:31.025 --> 01:18:32.665
... Will no longer be any more runways.

01:18:40.875 --> 01:18:44.290
- Everyone on the plane.

01:18:48.416 --> 01:18:50.865
<i>The plane was refueled there.</i>

<i>If they are alive...
Gushin will definitely take off.</i>

Ready. Let's go.

01:20:06.666 --> 01:20:08.874

01:20:08.875 --> 01:20:12.082

- Hold it.

01:20:12.083 --> 01:20:16.499
- I'm afraid of blood.
- And I'm afraid to fly. The same?

01:20:17.208 --> 01:20:18.790
People do not make noise is not?

01:20:18.791 --> 01:20:20.790
In much scarier mines.

01:20:24.375 --> 01:20:26.957
Is speed.

01:20:26.958 --> 01:20:28.957
Leonid Savych,
insufficient runway.

01:20:29.875 --> 01:20:30.907
Keep up yet.

01:20:47.208 --> 01:20:51.832
Come on, over here fast.
Give me your hand.

01:20:57.125 --> 01:21:02.124
Everyone remain calm.
Boarding order, we'll take off.

01:21:03.208 --> 01:21:05.624
Gushin. There's no one here.

01:21:05.625 --> 01:21:07.624
No one is how?

01:21:07.625 --> 01:21:10.957
- So who will drive?
- Which do anymore longer runway.

01:21:10.958 --> 01:21:13.124
We will take only burned here.

01:21:23.125 --> 01:21:24.957
- Mommy, I died.
- Calm down.

01:21:25.125 --> 01:21:27.082
Why are you standing there?

01:21:27.083 --> 01:21:30.207
Who is responsible here?
Now he is the captain. As the captain.

01:21:31.708 --> 01:21:34.207
Everyone please come on.
Let him see how.

01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:36.707
We want to know how
this will take off?

01:21:40.041 --> 01:21:43.040
When the fire, we will
take off on runway No. 2.

01:21:43.375 --> 01:21:44.457
All boarding. Hurry up.

01:21:51.791 --> 01:21:54.082
Preparing to move ladders away.

01:22:03.458 --> 01:22:05.040
Let me help.

01:22:08.333 --> 01:22:11.374
People do not get messy.
One by up only.

01:22:13.458 --> 01:22:14.540
- Sit down.
- Where is your mother?

01:22:14.541 --> 01:22:17.207
- He said his mother was on that plane?
- My mother was on another plane.

01:22:29.041 --> 01:22:32.165
UK sit down.
Sit down quickly.

01:23:21.375 --> 01:23:23.374
Everybody buckle up.

01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:39.040
Seat belts on the go.

01:23:59.208 --> 01:24:00.957
Why stop, the captain?

01:24:00.958 --> 01:24:02.957
- Why do not you take off?
- Other burning fuels.

01:24:05.416 --> 01:24:06.999
What to do?

01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:10.174
- Seeing the barrel there?
- So?

01:24:10.375 --> 01:24:12.374
In that country.

01:24:12.875 --> 01:24:16.165
The wire anchor will be
broken, and it will pour.

01:24:21.083 --> 01:24:23.332
I will take off in a few seconds.

01:24:24.541 --> 01:24:26.707
If it does that?

01:24:26.708 --> 01:24:29.457
Okay, will discuss
after landing.

01:24:29.791 --> 01:24:31.915
Take the passenger compartment.
In addition to that needed him more.

01:26:38.583 --> 01:26:40.540
Come on, hang on.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.207
- Burned you?
- We're burnt.

01:27:19.375 --> 01:27:22.749
Calm. Do not panic.
Be quiet.

01:27:22.750 --> 01:27:26.290
Sit down. It is OK.
Head down.

01:27:28.791 --> 01:27:31.124
Do not worry. Everything was okay.

01:27:32.041 --> 01:27:33.749
Sit here with me.
No, the sad Zinchenko.

01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:35.749
Come on. Be brave.

01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:38.065
- Across the burnt already.
- Stay in control.

01:27:38.166 --> 01:27:39.249
Go to reassure people go.

01:27:39.250 --> 01:27:40.474
How reassuring it?

01:27:40.575 --> 01:27:42.040
Please encourage them.
He is the man.

01:27:48.291 --> 01:27:49.332
I heard this.

01:27:50.416 --> 01:27:53.415
The plane took off in extremely
difficult conditions.

01:27:53.416 --> 01:27:55.415
Aircraft crossing the volcano...

01:27:55.625 --> 01:27:57.915
... But a fire engine.

01:27:57.916 --> 01:27:59.332
How long to pass the volcano?

01:27:59.333 --> 01:28:01.082
Unclear. Also Monday
mountains can fire...

01:28:01.083 --> 01:28:03.749
Nearby area runway
landing can not?

01:28:03.791 --> 01:28:05.874
Where  Get the runway.
There is the ocean.

01:28:05.958 --> 01:28:09.082
117, fire protection
system is working on it?

01:28:09.166 --> 01:28:11.040
<i>Fighting system
operating normally.</i>

01:28:11.191 --> 01:28:14.857
<i>The fire had broken off but the engine.
I was flying with one engine.</i>

01:28:20.591 --> 01:28:24.624
<i>Monday engine on fire, rpm is reduced.
I'm trying to put out the fire.</i>

01:28:26.541 --> 01:28:28.874
Please close the window.

01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:36.790
- Hello Mr. Igor Nicolayevich.
- Who's flying?

01:28:36.791 --> 01:28:39.832
The pilot episode of Zinchenko.
Newly hired not long.

01:28:39.833 --> 01:28:41.707
<i>I do not open fire system right...</i>

01:28:41.708 --> 01:28:43.707
<i>... Because the motor can be explosive.</i>

01:28:54.958 --> 01:28:56.582
Fighting, fighting.

01:29:00.791 --> 01:29:02.707
Passed volcano.

01:29:15.250 --> 01:29:17.024
The fire took off then.

01:29:27.791 --> 01:29:29.499
- This.
- What?

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:31.499
Go see everyone out
there, how are you.

01:29:35.625 --> 01:29:37.665
Let me ask, have dinner, no?

01:29:37.766 --> 01:29:40.499
- Huh?
- What happened? We are human... um...

01:29:43.583 --> 01:29:46.582
Stricken engine and
volcanic ash covered.

01:29:46.683 --> 01:29:48.582
There may be a problem landing.

01:29:48.875 --> 01:29:52.082
Please report to the nearest
airport thoroughly prepared.

01:29:52.083 --> 01:29:54.957
Sergeyevich, let preparing

01:29:55.958 --> 01:29:57.957
They can not be flying farther.

01:29:58.458 --> 01:29:59.990
Runway there surrounded by mountains.

01:30:01.791 --> 01:30:05.832
Be prepared airport in Petropavlovsk.
This is a unique opportunity.

01:30:08.125 --> 01:30:11.457
There is new information.
He switch to channel 2.

01:30:13.375 --> 01:30:17.457
Fuel tank has been punctured.
Serious fuel wastage.

01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:19.332
Was going low on fuel.

01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:21.932
Unable to fly to the mainland. Recalling
, can not...

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.832
Leonid Savych?
Leonid Savych.

01:30:24.843 --> 01:30:27.999
Probation?

01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:32.874
Yes. How are you?
Everything alright?

01:30:32.875 --> 01:30:34.874
Alesandra  How are you?

01:30:34.875 --> 01:30:36.874
Fine. Valera where?

01:30:38.416 --> 01:30:41.015
Headset. Wearing headphones to go.

01:30:44.208 --> 01:30:46.874
Valera? Heard his father?

01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:49.415
Hear that?

01:30:50.875 --> 01:30:52.807
If it was me, I never give up republish Where
.

01:30:52.975 --> 01:30:53.807
Valera.

01:30:55.291 --> 01:30:58.790
Valera, I heard you say?

01:30:58.875 --> 01:31:01.499
Leonid Savych. It's me.

01:31:02.625 --> 01:31:03.999
I see.

01:31:10.583 --> 01:31:11.999
They were alive.

01:31:18.666 --> 01:31:20.499
You can do that?
As a child of five.

01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:22.874
He waited until the last minute to refill fuel
aircraft.

01:31:22.958 --> 01:31:24.707
What would you blame?

01:31:26.541 --> 01:31:28.082
Zinchenko, how he?

01:31:28.083 --> 01:31:29.249
Out of fuel already.

01:31:31.375 --> 01:31:35.207
This plan, I will attempt landed
countries.

01:31:35.458 --> 01:31:39.915
The boat came to pick
him call people alive.

01:31:41.583 --> 01:31:42.707
What Ngoan, baby.

01:31:42.708 --> 01:31:44.582
- They have no choice other stars?
- No.

01:31:45.291 --> 01:31:46.957
Can mobilized naval vessels.

01:31:46.958 --> 01:31:48.749
However, this big wave...

01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:50.749
... But transport aircraft landed
again packed with people...

01:31:51.166 --> 01:31:53.415
That is almost no chance.

01:32:01.083 --> 01:32:04.332
Leonid, he was How much oil?

01:32:06.375 --> 01:32:09.124
If you're lucky, it was 20 minutes.

01:32:09.125 --> 01:32:12.332
- You can not fly to the mainland?
- It can not be.

01:32:13.041 --> 01:32:15.332
Generally the only miracle.

01:32:15.333 --> 01:32:18.082
There are procedures to respond
in this situation do not?

01:32:18.083 --> 01:32:20.082
Process  What now?

01:32:22.791 --> 01:32:27.624
Gushin. There was a time...
I see on TV.

01:32:28.458 --> 01:32:30.999
There is a circus
moved by cables...

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.999
... From aircraft to aircraft.

01:32:34.875 --> 01:32:36.207
Airborne.

01:32:48.375 --> 01:32:52.999
Leonid Savych.
There are ideas here.

01:32:55.041 --> 01:32:57.832
A friend of mine said...

01:32:57.833 --> 01:32:59.832
A fabulous idea.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.165
À Hoang Street?
That's what we need now.

01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:10.707
<i>So... he let the plane go down
right away elevation 3000.</i>

01:33:10.958 --> 01:33:13.165
<i>- Can you?
- To.</i>

01:33:13.166 --> 01:33:16.082
<i>It is possible to maintain stability
at the minimum speed you?</i>

01:33:16.583 --> 01:33:17.874
<i>Being.</i>

01:33:19.333 --> 01:33:23.074
<i>If the pressure allows, we
will open the aircraft.</i>

01:33:24.083 --> 01:33:27.415
<i>I will fly behind him.
We will open.</i>

01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:32.749
<i>We will use the rope to
bring people to this party.</i>

01:33:34.458 --> 01:33:36.540
Maybe so okay?

01:33:37.333 --> 01:33:38.790
In theory, it is...

01:33:39.666 --> 01:33:42.082
... But in reality, no
one has ever tried.

01:33:43.666 --> 01:33:46.874
<i>Please consult the Ministry of emergency situations.
Who knows, they offer ways.</i>

01:33:47.208 --> 01:33:49.374
<i>They stop only 20 minutes,
he did not hear back?</i>

01:33:49.375 --> 01:33:50.624
<i>What the hell is there?</i>

01:33:50.625 --> 01:33:52.540
<i>This is a civil
aircraft, not a circus.</i>

01:33:52.541 --> 01:33:53.957
<i>On it are many.</i>

01:33:53.958 --> 01:33:55.915
Do not you understand?
They did not have other options?

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.707
But the aircraft will collide!

01:34:00.625 --> 01:34:03.040
117, do not allow the adventurous.

01:34:03.041 --> 01:34:05.457
With motor  1
he could fly to the place.

01:34:05.458 --> 01:34:08.124
I prohibited.
If violated, he will go to prison.

01:34:08.291 --> 01:34:10.582
So we must be what has landed.

01:34:14.583 --> 01:34:17.040
Even the commandos,
it is too difficult.

01:34:17.183 --> 01:34:19.040
But this is  200 civilians

01:34:22.125 --> 01:34:23.499
More than 200 people...

01:34:34.208 --> 01:34:38.874
Dear passengers. Who told you
that pilots Alexey Gushin.

01:34:39.416 --> 01:34:42.957
Plane we can organize
a safe landing.

01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:45.499
But right near us
was a plane crash.

01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:47.124
On it there are many people.

01:34:47.125 --> 01:34:49.124
They will face if we
do not help victims.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.832
We need to help them...

01:34:51.833 --> 01:34:53.832
... Move into our air.

01:34:54.041 --> 01:34:56.124
I can not decide this alone.

01:34:56.625 --> 01:34:58.040
I need your support.

01:34:58.958 --> 01:35:02.582
Let's vote.
Who supporters?

01:35:07.791 --> 01:35:10.457
And sitting there doing?
Take out counters go.

01:35:11.166 --> 01:35:13.499
Do not allow to risk
in the process...

01:35:13.791 --> 01:35:15.790
... Then face dangerous
situations How's this?

01:35:16.041 --> 01:35:17.749
She sounded so simple,
Tamara Igorevna.

01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:19.874
Perhaps she had not seen
this situation ever, right?

01:35:19.875 --> 01:35:21.290
Make use?

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.040
How do I answer them?

01:35:25.250 --> 01:35:27.374
Simply does not
bother them anymore.

01:36:39.791 --> 01:36:43.665
I can not.
I am also the children...

01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:22.874
- It's there already.
- Peace of mind, I found it.

01:37:25.166 --> 01:37:27.582
Leonid Savych, I'm
following him.

01:37:29.791 --> 01:37:33.457
Okay. Now out there and
opening preparation.

01:37:33.916 --> 01:37:36.582
Be careful, clear?

01:37:36.666 --> 01:37:37.507
I'm out here.

01:37:37.666 --> 01:37:40.707
Shcalov, especially you, understand?

01:37:44.333 --> 01:37:47.332
- Attach to go help them.
- You come with pay.

01:37:47.333 --> 01:37:49.332
Just sit here and seatbelt on.

01:37:49.416 --> 01:37:52.582
- Your mother on that plane right?
- Seat belts on the go.

01:37:52.583 --> 01:37:55.332
Two, three... yet!

01:37:56.875 --> 01:37:59.665
Do versa. Two, three... yet!

01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:05.874
Do it again.
Two, three... yet!

01:38:08.166 --> 01:38:09.874
Doors can not be opened.

01:38:19.708 --> 01:38:21.915
Now, now. Come on come on.

01:38:33.333 --> 01:38:36.665
Leonid Savych.
I really wanted to blow that door.

01:38:37.208 --> 01:38:39.999
Can not open.
Sorry.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.474
Lyosha.
Listen say this announcement.

01:39:02.666 --> 01:39:03.624
<i>Dad?</i>

01:39:05.566 --> 01:39:06.624
<i>As announced stars?</i>

01:39:06.750 --> 01:39:09.124
Then  announced here. And nobody here anymore.

01:39:09.333 --> 01:39:12.165
Notes listen and do not interrupt.

01:39:12.208 --> 01:39:14.407
- There is an idea.
- What idea?

01:39:14.508 --> 01:39:17.832
Dad, you can get an idea what else?
Probably...

01:39:18.666 --> 01:39:20.365
Let's open the floor below
the passenger compartment.

01:39:21.083 --> 01:39:24.707
In the instructions say not to
disconnect power if not that.

01:39:24.708 --> 01:39:26.665
In it is the entire electrical system of the aircraft.

01:39:26.666 --> 01:39:29.749
Instructions are written by the
father, applied in normal conditions.

01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:32.582
But now there is normally no?

01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.957
Now, this place is open.

01:39:37.250 --> 01:39:40.415
Let's open cargo bay enters.

01:39:40.416 --> 01:39:43.457
Doors are insulated,
so it can be opened.

01:39:43.708 --> 01:39:47.082
Just ejected as possible open.

01:39:47.291 --> 01:39:50.707
That's all. And who can receive
through the cargo compartment door.

01:39:51.125 --> 01:39:53.999
- But I do not understand...
- You just try again added the watch.

01:39:54.375 --> 01:39:57.915
Maintain height difference
and reasonable distance.

01:39:57.916 --> 01:39:59.207
I see.

01:39:59.208 --> 01:40:03.249
Lie down and hold on.
Count to three and the bike on it.

01:40:03.250 --> 01:40:04.307
It's good.

01:40:08.166 --> 01:40:09.332
Thank announced.

01:40:10.366 --> 01:40:11.132
Three.

01:40:21.416 --> 01:40:27.665
You Dear passengers. I was No.
2 Alesandra Kuzmina pilots.

01:40:34.083 --> 01:40:37.790
Now we have to move
into another plane...

01:40:38.083 --> 01:40:39.374
... Even while flying overhead.

01:40:39.666 --> 01:40:42.490
Everyone please wear warm
clothes as possible.

01:40:42.666 --> 01:40:46.590
If cream or oil, then
rub into people wind.

01:40:46.666 --> 01:40:49.290
If people panic, we will die.

01:40:50.041 --> 01:40:53.374
If they are coordinated,
we will live.

01:40:53.625 --> 01:40:56.624
I will write to her the phone
number of my daughter.

01:40:56.625 --> 01:40:59.290
I asked her later call it.

01:41:00.041 --> 01:41:02.707
Do not panic that.
Later she would call that.

01:41:02.708 --> 01:41:06.290
I can not get out of here is where.
I will write here.

01:41:07.625 --> 01:41:11.499
I am sorry for it. It named Sophia.
Has seven years...

01:41:11.525 --> 01:41:15.374
My sister trapped in the bus.
Both of her children again.

01:41:15.875 --> 01:41:18.040
I was told to accompany me...

01:41:19.250 --> 01:41:21.040
... But she decided to stay.

01:41:21.291 --> 01:41:24.582
We quarreled and her last
sentence is to hear from me...

01:41:25.208 --> 01:41:30.415
"You idiot, do not ever talk to her again
." Oh my God.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:37.332
What Everyone please step back.
Be careful.

01:41:37.333 --> 01:41:40.540
We will open.
Be careful.

01:42:30.041 --> 01:42:32.332
Unable to access the cables.
I will translate to right.

01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:34.665
Well, be careful.

01:42:34.666 --> 01:42:36.374
Okay, are approaching.

01:42:49.375 --> 01:42:50.707
Loosen the belt.

01:42:52.666 --> 01:42:54.665
Add a little further away.

01:42:59.583 --> 01:43:01.082
Further away, yet.

01:43:07.666 --> 01:43:10.082
Pull to go, I caught it.

01:43:16.208 --> 01:43:17.749
Okay.

01:43:18.541 --> 01:43:20.874
We're ready, Leonid Savych.

01:43:21.291 --> 01:43:22.874
The most important is to stabilize
the speed and altitude.

01:43:22.875 --> 01:43:24.874
I will control the distance.

01:43:38.166 --> 01:43:40.957
Without him, she refused to go.

01:43:41.291 --> 01:43:42.582
That is her fiancé.

01:43:43.208 --> 01:43:45.707
Someone help push away.

01:43:45.708 --> 01:43:49.332
- The push to help him go.
- Let's push any help. Hurry up.

01:43:57.791 --> 01:44:00.332
Preparing the next trip away.

01:44:14.083 --> 01:44:16.040
Drop off any wires.

01:44:33.333 --> 01:44:34.957
Okay.

01:44:49.583 --> 01:44:51.207
Give me your hand.

01:44:54.041 --> 01:44:55.665
Give me your hands yet.

01:45:00.750 --> 01:45:02.332
Carefully. There are children there.

01:45:13.375 --> 01:45:15.207
Come here. Never mind then.

01:45:17.791 --> 01:45:19.624
Sit down.

01:45:22.541 --> 01:45:24.874
Careful, careful.

01:45:38.166 --> 01:45:40.874
Leonid Savych. The first
group was on a plane.

01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:43.624
We do very precise.

01:45:46.958 --> 01:45:49.915
The gentlemen, who still
does not warm clothes?

01:45:50.041 --> 01:45:52.957
Need to go to people
in the other plane.

01:45:52.958 --> 01:45:56.665
- They are in need of help.
- Here. She took off.

01:45:56.666 --> 01:45:59.707
She picked off. Also here

01:46:24.416 --> 01:46:26.790
Depleted oil at your limit.

01:46:27.458 --> 01:46:28.957
Is losing altitude.

01:46:35.916 --> 01:46:37.832
Please wear warm clothing on.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.457
Injured his spine.
Be careful.

01:46:41.458 --> 01:46:43.124
Take this.

01:46:48.083 --> 01:46:50.457
Grid may be cut there.

01:46:53.625 --> 01:46:56.332
Wait, is full already.

01:46:56.333 --> 01:46:57.915

01:47:53.041 --> 01:47:55.790
- Mom.

Let's go help the others go.

01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:38.499

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.499
Leonid Savych, I have
something to tell you.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.707
I was a little impatient... when on the island.

01:56:20.708 --> 01:56:22.040
Only slightly all?

01:56:33.458 --> 01:56:36.415

01:56:42.416 --> 01:56:45.124
Today, the right to fly by

The engine is about to stop then 2.

01:57:07.875 --> 01:57:10.557

I told her to go out.

01:57:33.458 --> 01:57:34.665
I can not.

01:57:36.066 --> 01:57:38.665
I can not. Let her do it,
she has more experience.

01:57:39.166 --> 01:57:41.415
I have never worked
like this ever.

01:57:41.791 --> 01:57:44.374

And she never did.

01:57:44.375 --> 01:57:47.790
Leonid Savych. I was scared.

01:57:48.458 --> 01:57:52.165
Behind  how many are there.
I'm afraid I can not do.

01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:55.040
I tried my best but fear is not.

01:57:55.291 --> 01:57:57.207
Leonid Savych, my hand trembled too.

01:57:57.208 --> 01:57:59.207
In fact, I'm very scared.

01:57:59.208 --> 01:58:02.332
I'm also afraid of this,
even worse than him anymore.

01:58:02.625 --> 01:58:05.915
At least he was still holding
firm joystick, I can not.

01:58:06.291 --> 01:58:09.874
