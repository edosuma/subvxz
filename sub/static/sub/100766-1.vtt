00:40.229 --> 00:42.640
- You're late again, Charlie.
- Sorry, Dwight. It was my alarm.

00:42.646 --> 00:44.396
Last time. I mean it. Katie!

00:49.521 --> 00:52.562
If you want to be the busboy,
you have to be on time. Your hear me?

01:14.062 --> 01:15.062
Here you go.

01:17.646 --> 01:18.687
Hey?

01:19.062 --> 01:20.062
Sleeping Beauty.

01:21.187 --> 01:22.187
Sorry.

01:22.396 --> 01:23.396
It's all right.

01:25.604 --> 01:26.604
Rough day?

01:28.271 --> 01:29.271
Yeah.

01:33.437 --> 01:34.562
What are you studying?

01:35.937 --> 01:40.979
Nothing. Just contemporary sociological
theory and empirical corporate analysis.

01:41.062 --> 01:42.271
Sounds like fun.

01:44.104 --> 01:47.521
You know, when it comes
to corporate empirical analysis,

01:47.604 --> 01:49.729
the jokes just kinda write themselves.

01:50.104 --> 01:51.312
That's what you'd think.

01:54.187 --> 01:55.604
Can I get you anything else?

02:01.729 --> 02:02.729
Adam.

02:03.312 --> 02:04.146
Honey.

02:04.229 --> 02:06.146
- No.
- My break's over.

02:06.229 --> 02:07.729
- No.
- Yes.

02:07.896 --> 02:09.437
- No.
- Come on.

02:09.604 --> 02:11.812
- No!
- Dwight's gonna come looking for me.

02:13.562 --> 02:15.812
- You gotta stop working nights.
- I know.

02:16.562 --> 02:17.896
It's all they've got.

02:18.396 --> 02:21.187
We just have to keep our heads
above water until you finish school.

02:22.437 --> 02:24.646
It's not exactly what I had in mind
when we got married.

02:25.521 --> 02:27.521
We made it this far. Right?

02:28.562 --> 02:30.271
We just have to see it through.

02:30.354 --> 02:33.146
Once you graduate school,
find a great job,

02:33.229 --> 02:34.771
I'll go back to grad school.

02:34.854 --> 02:37.562
And I can support you
in a manner in which you deserve.

02:38.271 --> 02:39.271
You'd better.

02:49.104 --> 02:50.646
How did I get so lucky?

02:52.854 --> 02:53.854
I love you.

02:54.187 --> 02:55.312
I love you too.

03:05.312 --> 03:07.479
Okay, let's go.
Dwight's gonna pitch a fit.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.854
- All right.
- Out the door.

03:09.937 --> 03:11.437
I'm going.

03:15.812 --> 03:16.812
Come on, you.

03:21.146 --> 03:23.746
- Where's the rest of it?
- There is no more money.

03:23.937 --> 03:26.137
- You have all the money.
- Give me the goddamned money!

03:26.521 --> 03:28.437
<b></b> Shut the hell up!

03:28.604 --> 03:30.396
Shut up or you're dead people!

03:30.479 --> 03:32.159
- Don't mess with me!
- I got nothing else!

03:32.229 --> 03:34.629
I'm gonna put a cap in your ass old man!
Do not mess with me!

03:34.646 --> 03:36.681
- Don't shoot somebody else.
- Yeah, well she's next!

03:36.687 --> 03:39.327
- Please, we don't need trouble.
- Want me to do it?

03:39.812 --> 03:42.396
I'll do it right now!
I'll do you all. Right now!

03:43.896 --> 03:46.806
- Nobody else gotta get hurt.
- Then give me the money man!

03:46.812 --> 03:48.852
You don't have to hurt anybody else.
Take the money.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.896
- Hey, I told you. Shut up!
- There is no more money!

03:51.979 --> 03:52.979
Shut up!

03:54.896 --> 03:56.437
I'm done with you, you hear me?

03:56.521 --> 03:59.396
- I'm done with both of you!
- I'm begging you!

03:59.646 --> 04:02.271
- Better pray old man!
- Give him all the money!

04:03.187 --> 04:06.896
I'll do it right now! You hear me?
Do not mess with me old man!

04:19.771 --> 04:21.937
<i>A customer is being called a hero</i>

04:22.021 --> 04:24.021

05:32.271 --> 05:33.271
Morning, Leonard.

05:53.562 --> 05:55.271
<b> <i>No new message.</i>

06:07.729 --> 06:08.729
Thank you, Katie.

06:10.062 --> 06:13.979
My father planted that tree
on the day I was born,

06:14.521 --> 06:16.562
eighty-eight years ago.

06:17.187 --> 06:18.229
It's beautiful.

06:18.729 --> 06:19.771
When I was a boy,

06:20.187 --> 06:23.354
people would say
my mother had a green thumb.

06:23.604 --> 06:26.396
Our garden was quite the show place.

06:26.771 --> 06:27.854
Look at it now.

06:28.979 --> 06:31.312
I hired a fellow once to clean it up.

06:31.729 --> 06:33.312
This was a couple of years ago.

06:33.646 --> 06:34.937
Nice young man.

06:35.229 --> 06:36.812
Ethan something, I think.

06:36.979 --> 06:38.062
What happened to him?

06:38.146 --> 06:39.354
I don't know.

06:39.771 --> 06:42.771
He worked for a few weeks
and then stopped coming.

06:42.854 --> 06:44.104
Never saw him again.

06:45.021 --> 06:46.062
Listen to me!

06:46.146 --> 06:48.771
- I sound like some silly old man.
- No!

06:48.854 --> 06:50.687
And today is our anniversary.

06:51.187 --> 06:53.937
- What?
- Yes. Four months ago today,

06:54.187 --> 06:56.021
the agency sent you to my door,

06:56.604 --> 07:00.312
my new caretaker, companion, and friend.

07:00.396 --> 07:01.396
And friend.

07:02.937 --> 07:03.937
Come on.

07:04.187 --> 07:05.896
It's time to take your medication.

07:10.104 --> 07:12.896
They're gonna schedule the last round
of interviews in a couple weeks.

07:14.146 --> 07:15.229
Couple of weeks?

07:16.979 --> 07:19.937
It's a big company.
Gotta jump through a lot of hoops.

07:21.937 --> 07:25.604
But... that kind of job, you know,
they have their own way of doing things.

07:25.687 --> 07:27.937
- I can't really push them.
- No, I know, I'm just--

07:29.396 --> 07:32.062
I'm a little stressed right now.

07:33.896 --> 07:36.729
You got another call
from the student loan people today.

07:37.271 --> 07:38.312
God, they never quit.

07:38.396 --> 07:43.354
Well, you stopped taking classes
so we have to start paying off the loans.

07:43.437 --> 07:45.771
Otherwise, they'll turn it over
to a collection agency.

07:45.854 --> 07:48.937
- I know, yeah, I'm gonna call tomorrow.
- Great. And maybe you can call

07:49.021 --> 07:51.104
the credit card people
while you're at it too.

07:51.187 --> 07:53.229
And the rep with our health insurance.

07:53.312 --> 07:55.812
Okay, Katie, I get it.
I'll figure something out, all right?

07:55.896 --> 07:56.896
Don't worry.

07:57.562 --> 07:59.396
I'm gonna get started on the dishes.

08:10.854 --> 08:12.687
- Katie.
- Don't tell me not to worry.

08:14.854 --> 08:15.854
I'm sorry.

08:24.646 --> 08:26.521
We're in serious trouble, Adam.

08:27.562 --> 08:30.729
- We need to get some money coming in soon.
- I'll find something.

08:30.812 --> 08:32.854
You've been saying that for months.

08:33.687 --> 08:36.604
It doesn't do us any good for me
to take some minimum wage job.

08:37.854 --> 08:41.437
That's why I quit school, so that
I can find something that pays enough.

08:42.062 --> 08:45.062
We can start chipping away at our debt.
I just need a little bit more time.

08:45.146 --> 08:47.521
We don't have any more time, Adam.

08:49.771 --> 08:52.146
- Here, let me help you.
- No, it's fine. I've got it.

08:52.229 --> 08:53.646
I've got it, Adam. Adam!

08:58.687 --> 08:59.687
I'll clean it up.

09:08.229 --> 09:09.854
Why don't you ever listen to me?

09:11.812 --> 09:13.104
Why did you go in there?

09:13.896 --> 09:15.812
I begged you, Adam.

09:17.146 --> 09:18.521
He could have killed you.

09:19.271 --> 09:22.521
I could have lost you.
Can you imagine how that would have felt?

09:22.604 --> 09:23.604
Never...

09:23.937 --> 09:26.521
holding you again,
never hearing your voice.

09:30.812 --> 09:32.229
Nothing's right anymore.

09:33.396 --> 09:35.062
Babe, it's been four months.

09:38.021 --> 09:39.021
No.

09:39.271 --> 09:40.604
No, I'm sorry. It's-- No.

09:43.562 --> 09:44.562
Where are you going?

09:45.062 --> 09:46.062
Out.

10:00.354 --> 10:01.354
Who's there?

10:27.354 --> 10:28.354
Leonard.

10:29.146 --> 10:30.146
Oh, it's you.

10:30.854 --> 10:31.854
Katie.

10:32.104 --> 10:34.437
- What are you doing out here?
- I thought you were asleep.

10:34.771 --> 10:36.771
I just... came here to think.

10:38.312 --> 10:39.479
What are you doing with that?

10:39.562 --> 10:41.437
I thought I heard someone
in the house again.

10:41.521 --> 10:43.062
- Again?
- I hear them walking

10:43.146 --> 10:44.826
and when I come down, they're always gone.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.229
There's no one in the house.

10:48.771 --> 10:49.771
Here.

10:50.521 --> 10:51.521
Are you all right?

10:53.562 --> 10:56.312
Why didn't you tell me
you had troubles with money?

10:57.062 --> 10:59.437
Oh, it's... not your problem.

10:59.521 --> 11:02.271
- How much do you need?
- Leonard, no.

11:02.354 --> 11:03.937
We're friends, aren't we?

11:04.021 --> 11:05.021
We are.

11:05.812 --> 11:07.229
Well, then let me help you.

11:07.562 --> 11:10.854
- I've got a little money set aside.
- I could never do that.

11:11.229 --> 11:13.562
A young couple starting out.

11:14.062 --> 11:18.062
The world is complicated enough.
You shouldn't have to worry about money.

11:18.146 --> 11:19.604
It comes with the territory.

11:20.187 --> 11:22.104
But to be in love,

11:22.354 --> 11:26.021
maybe have a family one day,
grow old together.

11:26.521 --> 11:28.271
These are wonderful things.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.396
Things I wanted when I was a young man.

11:31.479 --> 11:36.229
And it would be nice to think,
that in some small way,

11:37.354 --> 11:39.521
I made a difference to someone.

11:40.396 --> 11:42.354
Maybe to you and your young man.

11:48.146 --> 11:49.396
He needs a job.

12:01.771 --> 12:03.271
I'll tell Leonard you're here.

12:08.271 --> 12:09.271
It'll be fine.

12:10.187 --> 12:11.354
Just talk to him.

12:12.729 --> 12:13.729
Okay.

12:19.521 --> 12:21.687
Lorazepam, point five milligrams.

12:23.146 --> 12:24.146
Yes.

12:25.979 --> 12:29.146
I can pick it up after five probably...

12:29.229 --> 12:31.646
Local tycoons who built it...

12:31.729 --> 12:33.146
Thank you. Bye.

12:33.271 --> 12:37.021
...so they could get their family away
from the smell of the stock yards.

12:37.604 --> 12:39.896
But their children grew up and...

12:49.562 --> 12:50.979
- Hi, how are you doing?
- Hi.

12:51.062 --> 12:54.104
So sorry to bother you.
My name is Mickey Hayden.

12:54.604 --> 12:55.521
Real estate agent.

12:55.604 --> 12:57.937
Believe me, I know
how this is gonna sound, okay,

12:58.021 --> 13:01.687
but I have this new client,
just got transferred to the city for work.

13:02.062 --> 13:05.396
He's got a big family,
couple of dogs, the whole nine yards.

13:05.479 --> 13:09.104
It's adorable. Anyway,
he's looking for just the right home.

13:09.396 --> 13:12.271
And yesterday, he was driving
through the neighborhood here,

13:12.604 --> 13:14.562
took one look at this amazing house--

13:14.646 --> 13:16.187
Oh, this house isn't for sale.

13:17.271 --> 13:18.271
Are you the owner?

13:18.521 --> 13:22.187
No, but, trust me,
you'd be wasting your time.

13:22.562 --> 13:24.646
He's lived here his entire life.

13:24.979 --> 13:25.979
He's not going anywhere.

13:26.646 --> 13:29.062
My client is seriously motivated.

13:30.771 --> 13:32.211
Yeah, I don't know what to tell you.

13:32.562 --> 13:33.562
I'm sorry.

13:34.521 --> 13:35.521
But good luck.

13:35.854 --> 13:36.979
Oh, wait. Look...

13:37.771 --> 13:39.646
could you do me a favor, Ms...

13:41.354 --> 13:42.354
Katie.

13:42.437 --> 13:43.437
Katie.

13:43.729 --> 13:48.062
If by some crazy chance
he happens to change his mind,

13:48.979 --> 13:50.354
could you have him call me?

13:50.437 --> 13:52.521
That's not gonna happen, but sure.

13:52.937 --> 13:55.021
I appreciate that, thank you.

13:55.104 --> 13:56.104
Yeah.

13:56.187 --> 13:57.271
You have a great day.

13:57.812 --> 13:58.812
You too.

14:09.271 --> 14:11.896
- They want to make an offer?
- Sounds like it.

14:11.979 --> 14:13.779
They don't even care
what the yard looks like?

14:14.937 --> 14:17.521
I'm sure it'll look better
after you start work on it tomorrow.

14:19.604 --> 14:21.104
Place must be worth a fortune.

14:22.479 --> 14:23.479
Mm-hmm.

14:24.771 --> 14:25.771
Must be nice.

14:48.521 --> 14:49.521
Leonard?

15:08.687 --> 15:10.812
There you are. I've got your breakfast.

15:10.896 --> 15:13.354
- Thank you, Katie.
- Of course.

15:16.354 --> 15:18.187
My parents used to play this.

15:19.437 --> 15:20.437
It's lovely.

15:23.271 --> 15:24.854
Sit with me a moment.

15:26.062 --> 15:27.062
Sure.

16:02.646 --> 16:03.726
Did you lock the back door?

16:03.771 --> 16:04.771
- Yep.
- Good.

16:06.312 --> 16:10.479
So, when do I get the grand tour
and see how the other half lives?

16:10.687 --> 16:11.896
The time will come.

16:12.229 --> 16:13.437
What about that Buick?

16:14.062 --> 16:15.862
Looks like it's been parked there
for a while.

16:15.896 --> 16:19.229
- Does Leonard even drive it anymore?
- No, not since I've known him.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.396
I don't think he's driven it in years.

16:36.979 --> 16:38.146
I was reading online

16:39.062 --> 16:43.021
about this medical school with a really
great program in pediatric surgery.

16:45.146 --> 16:46.479
I could send you the link.

17:00.021 --> 17:01.021
I love you.

17:01.771 --> 17:02.771
I love you too.

17:21.146 --> 17:23.561
- Mr. Calvern.
- Hello Katie, how are you today?

17:23.646 --> 17:26.146
I'm fine, thank you.
We weren't expecting you.

17:26.396 --> 17:27.936
Oh, is-- Is this a good time?

17:28.021 --> 17:29.437
Sure, yeah. Come in.

17:33.229 --> 17:36.812
Leonard, Mr. Calvern is here
from the agency.

17:36.896 --> 17:38.604
Good morning, Mr. Wellsley.

17:38.687 --> 17:43.229
Mr. Calvern, how nice to see you again.
Come to check up on us?

17:43.521 --> 17:44.521
<b>No.

17:44.562 --> 17:46.442
Not at all. I happened
to be in the neighborhood

17:46.521 --> 17:48.896
and I thought I'd drop in, say hello.

17:49.187 --> 17:51.021
I thought we might have a chat.

17:51.104 --> 17:53.729
Yeah. I'll get lunch started.
Just call me if you need anything.

17:53.812 --> 17:55.104
- Thank you, Katie.
- Yeah.

17:55.187 --> 17:56.979
- Come back here.
- Oh, great.

17:57.437 --> 17:59.146
This is my favorite room.

17:59.896 --> 18:01.687
- What's for lunch?
- Adam!

18:02.104 --> 18:05.229
- You're all jumpy in the big scary house?
- You can't be in here.

18:05.521 --> 18:08.479
There's a guy from the agency,
and he's doing a drop-in.

18:08.812 --> 18:10.562
Oh. Well, you're doing a great job.

18:11.604 --> 18:14.515
Yeah, and he sees my husband working here.
That won't look a little funny?

18:14.521 --> 18:17.062
Oh, you mean like maybe we're just...
messing around?

18:17.146 --> 18:18.687
I don't know-- Stop it.

18:18.771 --> 18:19.771
- Come on.
- Okay.

18:26.937 --> 18:28.187
But I'm hungry.

18:28.687 --> 18:31.812
- So, how is everything?
- Love you.

18:31.896 --> 18:35.396
Well... that's a question
that people ask all the time

18:35.479 --> 18:37.146
to people of my age.

18:37.687 --> 18:41.146
Well, Mr. Wellsley seems
in good spirits.

18:41.229 --> 18:43.229
You two have gotten very close.

18:43.312 --> 18:45.979
Yeah, he's an interesting man.
I like talking to him.

18:46.062 --> 18:47.354
You hired a gardener?

18:48.187 --> 18:50.312
Part-time, yeah.
It was Leonard's idea.

18:50.562 --> 18:53.271
Okay. Well,
I'll see you soon, Katie.

18:53.354 --> 18:54.354
Yeah.

19:18.312 --> 19:22.646
I can't say I especially care
for our Mr. Calvern.

19:22.979 --> 19:26.229
- Why not?
- He keeps asking all these questions,

19:26.437 --> 19:29.271
like he's trying to trip me up
to make you look bad.

19:29.687 --> 19:32.979
He's just making sure
I'm taking good care of you. That's all.

19:33.062 --> 19:36.562
Well, don't you worry. I told him
I couldn't get along without you.

19:36.896 --> 19:37.896
Speaking of which...

19:38.937 --> 19:39.937
Thank you.

19:57.729 --> 19:58.729
Adam?

19:58.937 --> 19:59.937
Look.

20:00.687 --> 20:01.687
Look.

20:05.271 --> 20:06.271
Whoa.

20:07.146 --> 20:08.396
Did you get a raise?

20:09.104 --> 20:10.104
Oh, no.

20:11.396 --> 20:12.396
What?

20:13.312 --> 20:15.396
I said something to Leonard...

20:16.521 --> 20:17.521
about us.

20:17.937 --> 20:18.937
What do you mean?

20:19.354 --> 20:20.687
I told him we're broke.

20:23.229 --> 20:24.271
Christ, Katie.

20:26.146 --> 20:28.896
- It's a little personal, don't you think?
- I was upset.

20:29.354 --> 20:32.229
You were being a jerk,
and I needed to talk to somebody.

20:32.312 --> 20:34.521
- When was I being a jerk?
- That's not the point.

20:34.604 --> 20:37.437
Leonard wanted to help,
so he offered to give us money.

20:37.729 --> 20:38.729
And you said yes?

20:38.771 --> 20:40.896
No, I asked him to give you a job instead.

20:43.771 --> 20:47.312
Well, maybe this check is for both of us.
Like he added an extra zero.

20:51.062 --> 20:52.062
It's too much.

20:56.562 --> 20:57.562
What are you doing?

20:57.604 --> 21:01.354
I'm calling him. We can't keep this.
He has to write us another check.

21:01.437 --> 21:04.187
By the time we drive back to the house
and he writes another check,

21:04.271 --> 21:05.604
the bank will be closed.

21:06.187 --> 21:09.812
If we don't pay these bills by today,
Katie, they'll be kicking in our door.

21:11.771 --> 21:12.771
He's not answering.

21:13.812 --> 21:15.187
All right, look,

21:15.979 --> 21:17.062
why don't we...

21:17.771 --> 21:18.771
deposit the check--

21:18.812 --> 21:21.521
- We cannot take this money.
- It's just for tonight.

21:22.187 --> 21:24.146
Pay the bills.
Talk to Leonard in the morning.

21:24.229 --> 21:26.021
You can write him a check
for the difference.

21:30.771 --> 21:31.937
It's one night, Katie.

21:46.062 --> 21:47.562
What's Leonard's deal, anyway?

21:48.021 --> 21:50.229
What's he doing in that
big house all by himself?

21:51.646 --> 21:53.687
His parents passed away like...

21:54.521 --> 21:55.771
thirty years ago.

21:55.854 --> 21:58.021
He's an only child.
Never married.

21:59.646 --> 22:00.646
No other family?

22:01.187 --> 22:02.187
No.

22:02.854 --> 22:03.854
It must be tough...

22:04.604 --> 22:06.187
just being all alone like that.

22:06.521 --> 22:07.521
Yeah.

22:09.271 --> 22:10.396
He's such a good guy.

22:14.354 --> 22:15.354
Yeah.

22:31.812 --> 22:33.021
- Love you.
- I love you too.

23:12.521 --> 23:13.521
Leonard?

23:30.229 --> 23:31.229
Leonard?

23:36.604 --> 23:37.604
Leonard?

24:47.479 --> 24:48.479
I'm sorry.

24:53.521 --> 24:55.271
What was he doing up here in the attic?

24:55.896 --> 24:57.771
He liked to come up here sometimes.

24:59.187 --> 25:00.521
Listen to old records.

25:15.396 --> 25:17.521
What would he need to keep locked up here?

25:28.771 --> 25:29.771
Adam.

25:31.312 --> 25:32.312
We shouldn't.

25:34.521 --> 25:35.604
I'm just gonna look.

25:44.396 --> 25:45.396
Katie.

25:45.729 --> 25:46.729
Come look.

25:58.062 --> 25:59.146
Who's she?

26:05.937 --> 26:06.937
I don't know.

26:11.187 --> 26:12.312
All these letters.

26:18.271 --> 26:20.062
Didn't you say that Leonard never married?

26:27.687 --> 26:28.896
We shouldn't do this.

26:29.937 --> 26:30.771
All right.

26:30.854 --> 26:31.937
Let's go.

26:33.021 --> 26:34.312
We need to call 911.

26:36.812 --> 26:38.146
Holy!

26:40.479 --> 26:41.479
What?

26:46.396 --> 26:47.521
That's a lot of money.

26:51.854 --> 26:54.312
You said he lived alone
here for how many years?

26:55.187 --> 26:56.687
People get a little eccentric.

26:57.396 --> 26:59.354
Start by putting some aside,
little by little,

26:59.437 --> 27:00.562
and before you know it...

27:05.312 --> 27:07.021
He doesn't have any family.

27:16.771 --> 27:18.896
It'll end up in a police locker somewhere.

27:21.687 --> 27:22.812
Government'll take it.

27:24.354 --> 27:26.771
Why should we let it get caught up
in the system like that?

27:27.437 --> 27:29.521
When it could actually do some real good.

27:31.354 --> 27:34.604
I mean, you said yourself how much
he cared about you. He wanted to help.

27:36.187 --> 27:37.187
He did.

27:38.354 --> 27:39.562
Well, there you have it.

27:40.187 --> 27:41.604
A way for him to help you.

27:43.271 --> 27:44.271
Help us.

27:50.854 --> 27:52.437
We would have to be careful.

27:54.521 --> 27:55.854
Yeah. We will.

27:56.562 --> 27:57.562
Adam.

27:58.021 --> 27:59.479
- Yeah.
- Promise me.

28:02.646 --> 28:03.646
I promise.

28:16.062 --> 28:18.396
So how long did you work
for Mr. Wellsley?

28:19.229 --> 28:21.229
About four and a half months.

28:22.229 --> 28:23.437
And you lived here too?

28:24.479 --> 28:27.979
Leonard stayed here alone at night.
That's how he wanted it.

28:28.104 --> 28:29.687
He could still get around okay.

28:32.021 --> 28:33.521
When was the last time you saw him?

28:34.021 --> 28:35.312
Yesterday afternoon.

28:35.979 --> 28:38.729
We left a little early
to go to the bank around...

28:38.812 --> 28:39.646
Around 4:30.

28:39.729 --> 28:42.479
And you worked here too, Mr. Kettner?

28:42.562 --> 28:45.521
Just a couple weeks.
I was doing some yard work for Leonard.

28:46.854 --> 28:47.854
We're married.

28:48.312 --> 28:49.312
I kind of got that.

28:49.812 --> 28:50.812
Yeah.

28:54.937 --> 28:59.354
So how was Mr. Wellsley doing?
Was he having any health issues recently?

28:59.604 --> 29:01.771
No. He's been fine. I mean...

29:02.646 --> 29:05.896
he's 88,
so he took a lot of medication but...

29:07.479 --> 29:09.646
but he wouldn't have complained about it
anyway.

29:10.521 --> 29:11.646
He wasn't like that.

29:14.771 --> 29:18.104
Well, I'm gonna need to get some
contact information, next of kin.

29:20.146 --> 29:21.562
He doesn't have any family.

29:21.646 --> 29:22.646
No?

29:23.687 --> 29:24.687
No.

29:28.979 --> 29:30.229
I'm sorry for your loss.

29:31.104 --> 29:32.437
If you have any questions...

29:33.604 --> 29:34.646
just give me a call.

29:38.187 --> 29:41.146
Leonard once told me
he wanted to be cremated.

29:41.937 --> 29:44.396
He wanted his ashes spread in the garden.

29:47.854 --> 29:49.062
Let me get back to you.

29:49.562 --> 29:50.396
Okay.

29:50.479 --> 29:51.479
Thank you.

30:30.354 --> 30:31.396
Where are you going?

30:32.562 --> 30:36.146
I have to talk to Mr. Calvern
to get my name back on the list.

30:36.229 --> 30:37.229
What list?

30:37.312 --> 30:38.437
At the agency.

30:39.312 --> 30:40.396
For another position.

30:41.354 --> 30:42.354
Why?

30:43.562 --> 30:45.396
Because that's what I should do,

30:45.937 --> 30:47.604
now that I don't have a job.

30:49.146 --> 30:51.146
If you don't hear back
about that job soon,

30:51.229 --> 30:52.896
maybe you should start looking again too.

30:53.146 --> 30:54.771
All right. I will.

30:56.854 --> 30:58.187
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

31:33.437 --> 31:36.604
Katie, I am so sorry.
The two of you were so close.

31:36.687 --> 31:38.604
I can't imagine what a shock it was.

31:39.604 --> 31:41.187
If there's anything I can do...

31:41.437 --> 31:44.479
I would like to get another
assignment as soon as possible.

31:44.562 --> 31:47.812
- Oh, okay. Well, let's talk in my office.
- Okay.

32:00.604 --> 32:01.604
UNKNOWN

32:03.479 --> 32:04.479
Hello?

32:05.812 --> 32:06.812
Speaking.

32:08.937 --> 32:10.729
Oh! Hi, yeah.

32:11.854 --> 32:14.146
I agree. I thought
the interview went very--

32:17.354 --> 32:18.354
I see.

32:20.354 --> 32:22.479
Yeah, no, I completely understand.

32:23.354 --> 32:24.479
Thank you for calling.

32:25.687 --> 32:26.687
Yeah, you too.

32:30.604 --> 32:33.854
Katie, I assumed you knew.
I can't put you back to work,

32:33.937 --> 32:36.896
not until the police finish
their investigation.

32:37.646 --> 32:38.729
Investigation?

32:38.812 --> 32:43.187
Well, yes, when a client expires
under the supervision of an employee,

32:43.271 --> 32:47.604
we cooperate with the authorities
to be absolutely certain that there was...

32:49.521 --> 32:51.854
you know, how would it look
to a potential client

32:51.937 --> 32:53.896
that there was even any hint of--

32:54.146 --> 32:58.771
Wait, you think I had something
to do with what happened to Leonard?

32:58.854 --> 33:00.646
God, no. No, of course not.

33:00.729 --> 33:02.021
No. This is...

33:02.604 --> 33:05.062
I'm sorry, Katie.
This is company policy.

33:05.479 --> 33:09.021
There's nothing I can do until the police
officially close their investigation.

33:09.104 --> 33:11.104
So, how long is this gonna take?

33:12.854 --> 33:13.854
Yeah, I--

33:14.271 --> 33:15.271
I wish I knew.

34:15.771 --> 34:16.771
Hello?

35:04.646 --> 35:05.479
Hey.

35:05.562 --> 35:06.979
<i>What were you thinking?</i>

35:07.521 --> 35:11.354
You can't just come in here like this,
like we still belong here.

35:11.437 --> 35:14.979
Excuse me. I'm bleeding right now.
What do you want from me?

35:15.604 --> 35:17.521
We said we'd be careful, Adam!

35:18.354 --> 35:21.062
I asked you and you promised me.

35:21.604 --> 35:24.146
- You promised.
- All right. Okay!

35:24.229 --> 35:25.229
Look, I--

35:26.021 --> 35:27.021
I'm sorry.

35:28.062 --> 35:30.979
But if I wasn't here,
I think that money would be gone.

35:31.062 --> 35:32.687
How could anyone know about the money?

35:33.104 --> 35:36.062
- It's Leonard's. He kept it hidden.
- Why else would they be here, Katie?

35:39.062 --> 35:40.396
You didn't see who it was?

35:40.479 --> 35:41.854
No, they came up behind me.

35:43.646 --> 35:45.604
They couldn't have known you were here.

35:46.437 --> 35:48.146
They wouldn't have busted in like that.

35:48.229 --> 35:50.646
I heard the glass break.
That's why I came down.

35:51.062 --> 35:52.437
The back door was already open.

35:52.521 --> 35:55.062
And you didn't think
maybe that was a bad sign,

35:55.146 --> 35:56.771
that you should get out?

35:56.854 --> 35:58.187
No, I didn't have time to think.

35:58.271 --> 36:01.229
The next thing I know, I was waking up
to the sound of my phone ringing.

36:01.312 --> 36:03.979
How could you do this, Adam?
This never should have happened.

36:04.062 --> 36:05.437
You never should have been here.

36:05.521 --> 36:07.604
- That's not the point!
- Then what's the point?

36:07.687 --> 36:11.271
- Almost a hundred grand! That's the point.
- You're always trying to justify your--

36:14.229 --> 36:15.229
You counted it?

36:18.187 --> 36:20.771
I counted to 92,000, and there was more.

36:29.479 --> 36:31.979
Then she calls me to say how sorry she is

36:32.271 --> 36:35.771
that the hiring committee
decided to go another way.

36:36.604 --> 36:38.104
Whatever the hell that means.

36:38.229 --> 36:39.646
I don't even know...

36:40.771 --> 36:42.354
They're all just such assholes.

36:42.937 --> 36:44.354
I'm just sick of being poor.

36:49.646 --> 36:50.771
Who was it, Adam?

36:51.229 --> 36:52.229
Who got in here?

36:54.854 --> 36:57.771
Maybe somebody
who did some work on the house?

36:58.729 --> 37:02.396
- Sometime before you started.
- Leonard talked about hiring a gardener,

37:03.146 --> 37:04.812
but that was a couple of years ago.

37:07.437 --> 37:10.854
Well, whoever it was,
I don't think it was a coincidence.

37:11.521 --> 37:13.729
They must have known
that Leonard had passed away.

37:13.812 --> 37:15.812
And figured the house would be empty.

37:18.229 --> 37:19.229
Yeah.

37:20.271 --> 37:21.437
But maybe you're right.

37:22.229 --> 37:23.896
Maybe they didn't know about the money.

37:23.979 --> 37:26.187
They probably just wanted
to get in and get out.

37:26.271 --> 37:28.229
Just grab whatever they can get away with.

37:30.562 --> 37:31.812
What if they come back?

37:36.396 --> 37:37.836
All right, right this way.

37:48.271 --> 37:49.271
There you go.

37:50.271 --> 37:51.479
Just ring when you're ready.

37:51.562 --> 37:52.562
Thank you.

38:07.812 --> 38:08.812
Babe.

38:09.604 --> 38:10.604
Dinner's on me.

38:11.104 --> 38:12.104
All right.

39:30.937 --> 39:32.396
- Morning.
- Morning.

39:33.146 --> 39:34.521
I was just making you coffee.

39:36.521 --> 39:40.521
<i>Ms. Franklin, this is Detective Chesler.
We spoke at Mr. Wellsley's house.</i>

39:41.396 --> 39:43.604
<i>Would you give me a call
when you get this message?</i>

39:43.729 --> 39:45.146
<i>You have the number. Thanks.</i>

39:55.354 --> 39:57.812
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Thanks for coming in.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.646
Detective. Is there a problem?

39:59.979 --> 40:01.437
Why don't we talk back here?

40:04.729 --> 40:06.896
Did Mr. Wellsley ever mention a will?

40:07.229 --> 40:08.062
No.

40:08.187 --> 40:09.187
And no family?

40:09.521 --> 40:11.271
He was all alone.

40:11.729 --> 40:13.396
Well, something like this,

40:14.104 --> 40:19.187
the rich old man, living alone, no heirs.
We just have to cross all of our t's.

40:20.521 --> 40:21.521
I'm sorry, Detective.

40:22.312 --> 40:23.812
<b>I don't...

40:24.604 --> 40:25.687
What is this about?

40:26.687 --> 40:30.104
Well, you said that
Mr. Wellsley asked to be cremated.

40:30.187 --> 40:33.396
So I'm assuming that you
want to honor his request.

40:35.437 --> 40:36.437
Yes.

40:37.021 --> 40:38.021
Yes, we do.

40:39.521 --> 40:41.562
Without a family and no will,

40:41.812 --> 40:44.646
the question becomes who bears
the cost of the arrangements.

40:44.729 --> 40:46.104
We'll take care of Leonard.

40:49.937 --> 40:52.771
Okay. I've got
the paperwork right here.

40:58.854 --> 40:59.687
What's that?

40:59.771 --> 41:01.062
His favorite tea.

41:10.229 --> 41:11.229
Thanks.

41:13.771 --> 41:14.771
For Leonard.

41:15.979 --> 41:16.979
Leonard.

41:21.354 --> 41:22.812
We should put the money back.

41:24.896 --> 41:26.021
It doesn't feel right.

41:32.229 --> 41:33.312
Let's just be here.

41:34.437 --> 41:35.437
For Leonard.

41:41.562 --> 41:43.146
We should say something.

41:44.271 --> 41:45.687
"And he shall be like a tree,

41:46.146 --> 41:48.146
planted by the rivers of water.

41:48.229 --> 41:50.687
That bringeth forth
his fruit in his season

41:51.271 --> 41:53.687
and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper."

41:55.604 --> 41:57.062
I'm sorry. Who are you?

41:57.646 --> 42:00.979
Apologies, Ms. Franklin.
My name is Julia Byron-Kim.

42:01.562 --> 42:03.021
I'm Mr. Wellsley's attorney.

42:05.771 --> 42:07.562
Ms. Byron-Kim,

42:08.562 --> 42:11.729
Leonard never said anything
about an attorney.

42:12.271 --> 42:14.729
Please, call me Julia.
And I'm not surprised.

42:15.521 --> 42:16.521
What do you mean?

42:17.187 --> 42:19.937
The first I heard from Mr. Wellsley
was only a few weeks ago.

42:20.021 --> 42:22.812
He called me out of the blue,
wanting me to write up his will,

42:22.896 --> 42:24.687
and asked me to come to the house.

42:25.562 --> 42:28.604
- I never saw you here.
- He was very specific about that.

42:28.687 --> 42:30.396
I was to only come in the evenings.

42:31.271 --> 42:32.271
Why?

42:38.687 --> 42:40.146
He left everything to you.

42:51.062 --> 42:52.937
- Oh, my God!
- Congratulations.

42:53.479 --> 42:54.479
<b>Oh, my God!

42:55.021 --> 42:57.187
I don't even know what to say.
This is...

42:57.604 --> 42:58.896
Say thank you, Leonard!

43:01.229 --> 43:02.229
Wow.

43:02.437 --> 43:05.271
Okay, so what happens now?

43:05.812 --> 43:08.604
First, I suggest you read
over the will very carefully.

43:08.854 --> 43:11.146
Better yet, I would have
your lawyer take a look.

43:11.229 --> 43:12.549
Actually, we don't have a lawyer.

43:14.562 --> 43:17.187
Well, Mr. Wellsley did pay my retainer
in advance,

43:17.271 --> 43:20.104
asked that I help you
through this transition.

43:20.187 --> 43:22.147
What transition?
We can't just move in right away?

43:22.812 --> 43:23.729
Of course you can,

43:23.812 --> 43:26.252
with the understanding
that the will is going through probate,

43:26.312 --> 43:27.896
which takes about three months.

43:28.812 --> 43:30.687
And if there are any surprises,

43:30.771 --> 43:33.104
you should have someone
to look after your interests.

43:33.729 --> 43:36.479
Now, I understand if you
want to find your own lawyer.

43:36.562 --> 43:39.229
You said Leonard called you
out of the blue.

43:39.312 --> 43:40.562
You didn't know him?

43:41.854 --> 43:43.021
I never met him before.

43:45.104 --> 43:46.604
Why did he call you?

43:46.937 --> 43:48.354
He found me on the Internet.

43:49.146 --> 43:50.687
He said that he liked my name.

43:52.687 --> 43:54.187
Byron was his favorite poet.

43:57.271 --> 43:58.271
Ms. Byron-Kim.

43:58.854 --> 44:00.271
Sorry, Julia...

44:02.229 --> 44:03.354
I'm kind of new at this.

44:03.437 --> 44:05.979
I'm not really sure
how to go about it officially,

44:06.729 --> 44:08.187
but I could really use your help.

44:10.187 --> 44:12.271
There are some big changes
coming your way.

44:12.354 --> 44:13.354
I hope you're ready.

44:13.979 --> 44:14.979
Me too.

44:16.771 --> 44:18.146
And how about Adam?

44:18.812 --> 44:19.646
What about him?

44:19.729 --> 44:21.249
Well, he does understand that legally,

44:21.312 --> 44:24.229
where it comes to this house,
you make all the decisions.

44:25.312 --> 44:27.229
We've always decided things together.

44:27.312 --> 44:28.646
Which is how it should be.

44:30.021 --> 44:34.146
These things, you just never know
how it can change someone.

44:36.229 --> 44:37.229
We'll be okay.

44:37.979 --> 44:38.979
Good.

44:39.229 --> 44:40.812
- Leave it to me then.
- Great.

44:40.896 --> 44:42.312
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

44:42.687 --> 44:45.854
We should take a vacation for a month.
Just first class all the way.

44:45.937 --> 44:49.312
You'll get your MBA before you know it.
Find a great job.

44:50.021 --> 44:52.979
- That piece of junk that we drive.
- We can pay off everything.

44:53.062 --> 44:56.771
Credit cards, loans,
just wipe the slate clean.

44:56.854 --> 44:59.979
You know, we should go right now.
Both of us. Just go pick brand new cars.

45:00.062 --> 45:02.271
- Come on, Adam. I'm serious.
- Yeah, me too.

45:02.396 --> 45:05.396
- We can't do that.
- Why not? We have the money.

45:05.479 --> 45:08.771
We can't just walk in there
with all that cash. It'll look weird.

45:08.854 --> 45:11.646
- People are gonna ask questions.
- Yeah. No. You're right.

45:12.354 --> 45:14.646
I did some research online
and been looking into that.

45:14.729 --> 45:15.729
Into what?

45:15.854 --> 45:19.104
See there's ways we can make it work,
right? We just spread the money around.

45:19.187 --> 45:20.947
Different banks,
different kinds of accounts.

45:21.021 --> 45:22.562
What are you talking about?

45:22.646 --> 45:26.062
If we do this right,
it's like nobody will ever know.

45:26.146 --> 45:28.271
We can get away with so much in taxes.

45:28.479 --> 45:29.479
Adam.

45:30.021 --> 45:32.104
We still have to be careful.

45:32.604 --> 45:34.646
We have been careful, okay?

45:34.729 --> 45:37.354
Don't you think it's time for us
to treat ourselves?

45:37.729 --> 45:38.729
You earned it.

45:39.104 --> 45:40.312
God knows I have.

45:41.062 --> 45:45.062
I mean maybe you're right,
but we have to settle in first,

45:45.146 --> 45:47.521
take things slow, you know. Just...

45:48.229 --> 45:50.479
Just a little while longer. Okay?

45:54.021 --> 45:55.021
Yeah.

45:55.146 --> 45:56.146
Okay.

45:57.604 --> 45:58.646
We'll take it slow.

46:09.271 --> 46:12.562
I'll call the movers. See how soon
we can get them over here.

46:12.646 --> 46:14.979
What? We don't need any of this stuff.

46:15.437 --> 46:18.146
What? It's our stuff.
We've had it since we got married.

46:18.229 --> 46:21.104
Yeah well, here, we'll keep the pictures
and some of those books,

46:21.187 --> 46:22.812
and we don't need the rest of this junk.

46:22.896 --> 46:24.771
What are we supposed to do with all of it?

46:24.937 --> 46:27.973
Just leave it for the next poor losers
that have to live in this dump, right?

46:27.979 --> 46:29.521
Jeez, Adam.</b>

46:30.771 --> 46:31.771
Hello?

46:36.187 --> 46:39.562
Yeah, that was five months ago and
I already gave the police my statement.

46:40.771 --> 46:42.011
<i>Who was it who called you, sir?</i>

46:42.312 --> 46:45.896
I didn't get the name. He just said
talk to someone at the front desk.

46:47.479 --> 46:48.479
I got nothing.

46:50.437 --> 46:52.562
Mr.Kettner, everything okay?

46:52.646 --> 46:54.979
He says somebody told him
to come down, make a statement.

46:55.479 --> 46:56.479
What's this regarding?

46:58.146 --> 47:01.396
Like five months ago somebody robbed
the Smile Diner, killed somebody.

47:02.187 --> 47:03.854
You were at the diner that night?

47:03.979 --> 47:04.979
Yes.

47:05.979 --> 47:07.312
Lucky you didn't get hurt.

47:07.729 --> 47:08.729
I kinda stopped the guy.

47:09.187 --> 47:10.021
You did?

47:10.104 --> 47:13.437
Yeah, in that situation, I reacted.
My wife was working that night so...

47:14.646 --> 47:15.854
Ms. Franklin was there too?

47:15.979 --> 47:19.812
Yeah, but what I don't understand
is you already have the guy locked up.

47:19.896 --> 47:21.687
Why do they need another statement?

47:22.729 --> 47:23.729
They don't.

47:24.354 --> 47:25.604
What are you talking about?

47:26.562 --> 47:29.437
That guy from the diner, Ray Gaskin.

47:29.687 --> 47:31.146
- Yeah.
- He's dead.

47:32.104 --> 47:34.729
Somebody stabbed him
in his cell a couple weeks ago.

47:36.146 --> 47:37.229
So who called me?

47:39.187 --> 47:40.687
Kind of wondering that myself.

48:04.187 --> 48:05.187
Excuse me?

48:06.062 --> 48:08.062
Hello, Katie.
Do you remember me?

48:08.729 --> 48:10.129
Yeah, what are you doing back here?

48:10.187 --> 48:14.021
I know, a pain in the ass, right?
But my client, he's driving me nuts.

48:14.104 --> 48:19.062
He just-- He absolutely loves the place.
I think he wants to make an offer.

48:19.146 --> 48:20.396
I told you already.

48:20.771 --> 48:22.062
It's not for sale.

48:22.146 --> 48:24.812
Maybe, if I could speak
with the owner myself,

48:25.271 --> 48:26.646
at least I can say I tried.

48:26.729 --> 48:30.729
Look, I'm really busy and you can't
just show up here like this, so...

48:32.437 --> 48:34.354
I want you to go now. Please.

48:36.854 --> 48:37.854
You know, Katie?

48:39.146 --> 48:40.729
This ain't my first rodeo.

48:42.646 --> 48:45.062
You know, one of the first lessons
in real estate...

48:45.729 --> 48:47.979
if you want to find new listings,

48:48.562 --> 48:49.646
check the obituaries.

48:50.146 --> 48:51.354
<b>Yes,

48:51.521 --> 48:54.604
I know all about the late Mr. Wellsley.

48:55.396 --> 48:56.396
Sad.

48:58.562 --> 49:00.187
The house isn't for sale.

49:01.187 --> 49:04.104
You know, I've had my eye
on this house for a couple years.

49:05.271 --> 49:06.271
The old man...

49:07.146 --> 49:08.146
kicks the bucket...

49:09.354 --> 49:11.687
and you think you can just move in?

49:12.271 --> 49:13.396
I'm gonna smile?

49:14.062 --> 49:15.062
Wish you well?

49:18.896 --> 49:20.021
I own the house now.

49:21.771 --> 49:22.931
What the hell are you saying?

49:22.979 --> 49:24.354
Leonard left it to me.

49:25.521 --> 49:26.896
I have his will, I can prove it.

49:28.396 --> 49:29.562
Yeah, well for five grand

49:29.646 --> 49:33.062
I can make a new will that says
it belongs to my dear Aunt Myrtle.

49:33.146 --> 49:33.979
I have a lawyer.

49:34.062 --> 49:35.062
Of course you do.

49:35.104 --> 49:38.062
If you have any more questions,
I suggest you talk to her

49:38.146 --> 49:42.021
but, in the meantime, get the hell off
my property before I call the police.

49:44.354 --> 49:47.521
All right. Well, I guess
I'll see you around, Katie.

49:55.021 --> 49:56.396
He's just messing with you.

49:56.729 --> 49:58.021
It's not how it sounded.

49:58.771 --> 50:01.604
He practically accused me
of forging the will.

50:03.312 --> 50:04.229
Babe, trust me.

50:04.312 --> 50:06.979
The thing this guy cares about
is what he's losing on commission.

50:07.604 --> 50:08.896
Maybe I should talk to Julia.

50:12.854 --> 50:13.854
The lawyer?

50:14.604 --> 50:15.604
Why?

50:15.729 --> 50:18.646
In case Hayden tries to make trouble?

50:19.771 --> 50:20.646
What could he do?

50:20.729 --> 50:24.937
I don't know but it's like she said,
we don't want any surprises right now.

50:26.229 --> 50:27.229
Katie.

50:27.771 --> 50:30.854
This guy is just pissed off.
Forget about him.

50:32.187 --> 50:33.187
Come on.

50:33.729 --> 50:35.354
It's our first night in our new house.

50:36.354 --> 50:37.354
We should celebrate.

50:41.646 --> 50:42.646
Yeah?

50:43.312 --> 50:44.312
Mm-hmm.

50:44.771 --> 50:46.229
What did you have in mind?

50:48.937 --> 50:50.187
I can think of something.

50:56.896 --> 50:58.854
- Let me take a shower first.
- What?

50:58.937 --> 51:01.354
I've been cleaning the house all day.
I'll be right out.

51:22.979 --> 51:23.979
What is this?

51:26.812 --> 51:29.229
My old one stopped working, so...

51:29.937 --> 51:31.062
Looks expensive.

51:32.771 --> 51:34.271
Well, it's a knock off.

51:34.729 --> 51:36.271
Just bought it from some guy downtown.

51:39.354 --> 51:40.354
Very convincing.

51:44.562 --> 51:45.562
You want company?

51:48.812 --> 51:49.812
I'll be right out.

52:33.104 --> 52:34.104
Detective!

52:34.687 --> 52:37.896
- Looks like I came at a bad time.
- No, you're fine. Come in.

52:38.354 --> 52:39.687
You folks going somewhere?

52:39.771 --> 52:44.062
Yeah, we're moving, actually,
into Leonard's house.

52:44.146 --> 52:45.146
Leonard?

52:45.437 --> 52:46.729
As in Mr. Wellsley?

52:46.812 --> 52:49.604
I know. I'm still getting used
to the idea myself.

52:51.271 --> 52:54.604
Leonard left it to me in his will.

52:56.062 --> 52:59.437
Now then, that is a very nice house.

52:59.812 --> 53:00.937
Yes, it is.

53:01.021 --> 53:02.812
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

53:03.646 --> 53:06.312
So, a thing like that,
what do they call it?

53:07.896 --> 53:08.896
A windfall.

53:10.437 --> 53:11.687
Doesn't happen every day.

53:12.104 --> 53:13.104
Nope.

53:14.937 --> 53:16.687
Funny you forgot to mention it.

53:17.104 --> 53:18.104
What?

53:18.146 --> 53:20.687
The will, and all, when we spoke.

53:20.771 --> 53:22.729
I asked you about his family,
about a will.

53:22.812 --> 53:26.896
Oh no, I didn't know about it until
after the service. His lawyer came by.

53:27.229 --> 53:28.896
That must've been quite a shock.

53:29.437 --> 53:30.979
Yeah, it was.

53:32.146 --> 53:34.479
I'd have loved to see
the look on your face.

53:34.646 --> 53:36.521
You know, I mean you worked there for...

53:37.229 --> 53:39.104
what did you say? Four months?

53:41.271 --> 53:42.896
Why are you here, Detective?

53:44.562 --> 53:46.354
I was hoping to speak with your husband.

53:47.187 --> 53:48.187
He's not here.

53:49.646 --> 53:52.021
Well, maybe you can help me.

53:52.271 --> 53:54.062
See, I was wondering

53:54.312 --> 53:57.771
when you worked nights at that place,
the Smile Diner,

53:58.271 --> 54:00.021
did he pick you up all the time?

54:02.104 --> 54:04.562
I mean, he picked you up before.

54:06.146 --> 54:07.146
Yeah.

54:07.229 --> 54:08.812
Right, but was it a set thing?

54:09.271 --> 54:11.687
Was it every night, was it certain nights?

54:12.271 --> 54:13.562
No, not exactly.

54:13.979 --> 54:15.854
So how did he happen
to be there that night?

54:17.062 --> 54:22.229
I-- I called him to pick me up
and he came early to study.

54:24.312 --> 54:26.854
Well, you ought to play the lottery,
Katie.

54:27.646 --> 54:29.021
You're a very lucky woman.

54:31.854 --> 54:34.229
Does this have anything
to do with the fact that

54:34.604 --> 54:37.604
the police called Adam
about making another statement?

54:38.937 --> 54:39.937
He didn't tell you?

54:41.979 --> 54:43.437
Police never called Adam.

54:44.854 --> 54:47.646
No, I was here.
They called him down at the station.

54:47.729 --> 54:49.521
No, I checked it out after he left.

54:49.896 --> 54:52.354
There's no record
of any calls to his number.

54:53.437 --> 54:55.896
That doesn't make any sense.
Why would-- Why would anyone...

54:56.562 --> 54:58.396
send him down there for no reason?

54:58.854 --> 55:00.812
Well, maybe they had a reason.

55:01.979 --> 55:03.937
Maybe it's just not the one you think.

55:05.687 --> 55:06.687
Take care now.

55:25.687 --> 55:28.062
Thanks, Julia.
I'll talk to you later, bye.

55:40.312 --> 55:41.312
Katie.

55:42.021 --> 55:43.021
What did she want?

55:44.521 --> 55:46.271
I called her, actually.

55:47.521 --> 55:48.521
What did you tell her?

55:49.396 --> 55:50.396
Nothing.

55:53.187 --> 55:54.479
That's not how it looked.

55:55.021 --> 55:57.396
Looked like you guys were best friends
all of a sudden.

55:57.521 --> 55:59.479
Well, maybe if you'd been here,

56:00.062 --> 56:01.687
maybe if you'd answered your phone...

56:03.312 --> 56:04.312
We agreed.

56:05.646 --> 56:07.406
We decided you were not going
to talk to her.

56:07.479 --> 56:09.437
No, you decided.

56:10.271 --> 56:12.812
Like you've been deciding
a lot of things lately.

56:15.396 --> 56:17.021
What are you even talking about?

56:17.937 --> 56:21.854
Why didn't you tell me
that it wasn't the police who called you?

56:22.479 --> 56:25.021
It was somebody else who made
sure you went down there, right?

56:25.354 --> 56:26.354
Who told you that?

56:27.437 --> 56:29.396
Detective Chesler dropped by.

56:31.229 --> 56:33.271
And she was asking a lot of questions,

56:33.812 --> 56:34.812
about you,

56:35.271 --> 56:37.979
about what happened
the night of the diner.

56:38.854 --> 56:39.854
What is that about,

56:39.937 --> 56:40.937
Adam?

56:41.021 --> 56:42.812
<b>How should I know?

56:42.896 --> 56:43.896
Who called?

56:44.021 --> 56:46.354
- Who sent you to the police station?
- I don't know!

56:47.562 --> 56:49.479
My bad, I was gonna tell you about it.

56:49.562 --> 56:52.104
It's a whole lot of other stuff
has been happening right now.

56:52.187 --> 56:53.271
What other stuff?

56:55.604 --> 56:56.771
I think I'm being followed.

56:58.396 --> 56:59.396
What?

56:59.604 --> 57:01.229
I kind of had the feeling before.

57:01.937 --> 57:04.896
Today, I just went driving
around, just around.

57:06.562 --> 57:08.021
I kept seeing the same car.

57:11.896 --> 57:13.062
Did you go to the bank?

57:13.562 --> 57:16.437
- Come on, we said we would not do that.
- No, Adam. No bullshit.

57:16.521 --> 57:19.021
Just tell me.
Did you go to the bank today?

57:19.646 --> 57:20.937
Did you take money out?

57:21.354 --> 57:22.396
I noticed him.

57:23.271 --> 57:24.687
So I figured, you know,

57:25.229 --> 57:27.354
it wouldn't be a good idea.
Just in case.

57:27.437 --> 57:28.729
In case he was after the money.

57:28.812 --> 57:31.812
- We don't know that.
- Why else is he watching you?

57:31.896 --> 57:33.312
Look, maybe I'm just paranoid.

57:33.396 --> 57:36.062
Okay? Maybe there's nobody
who's following me. I don't know.

57:36.146 --> 57:38.562
You got sent down
to the police station, Adam.

57:38.646 --> 57:40.312
That way, I'm here alone.

57:40.396 --> 57:43.854
That way, Hayden shows up,
tries to intimidate me,

57:44.062 --> 57:47.271
scare us out of the house. What is that?
Why is he here?

57:47.979 --> 57:49.312
Because he probably knows.

57:52.146 --> 57:53.146
I warned you.

58:04.562 --> 58:05.562
Chesler.

58:06.312 --> 58:07.312
Hey, Tom.

58:08.479 --> 58:09.479
You did?

58:10.396 --> 58:11.396
Great.

58:11.937 --> 58:13.812
Great, okay. Hold on.

58:17.104 --> 58:20.271
All right, so probably just
from the last four, five months.

58:20.562 --> 58:24.396
We're looking for any checks drawn
on an account from a Leonard Wellsley.

58:25.896 --> 58:27.604
Yeah, made out to her name.

58:28.062 --> 58:29.062
Yeah.

58:29.729 --> 58:31.687
It's Kate... Franklin.

58:38.062 --> 58:40.396
Listen, can you see
what you got on the husband too?

58:40.479 --> 58:42.021
It's a different last name.

58:43.146 --> 58:45.146
It's an Adam Kettner with a "K."

58:46.604 --> 58:49.104
Great, get back to me
as soon as you can. Thanks.

59:11.062 --> 59:12.187
What are you looking for?

59:15.396 --> 59:17.562
Leonard didn't just stash that money.

59:18.354 --> 59:21.229
It had to come from somewhere.
There has to be a reason.

59:22.521 --> 59:23.604
Does that even matter now?

59:30.062 --> 59:31.104
Julia said...

59:32.062 --> 59:35.229
if they find out
we've been hiding something illegal,

59:35.562 --> 59:36.896
we could lose everything.

59:38.229 --> 59:39.229
All right.

59:39.771 --> 59:42.021
So what do you suggest?
We just give it all back?

59:42.104 --> 59:43.104
I don't know.

59:44.312 --> 59:45.521
Yeah, maybe.

59:46.937 --> 59:49.021
- To whom, Katie?
- I don't know!

59:50.854 --> 59:52.271
But this never felt right.

59:54.937 --> 59:57.396
I'm not going back to the way
things were before.

59:59.354 --> 01:00:00.354
Adam.

01:00:02.521 --> 01:00:03.771
We may not have a choice.

01:00:07.562 --> 01:00:08.812
We always have a choice.

01:00:12.687 --> 01:00:17.271
I had absolutely no idea
that Mr. Wellsley left Katie the house.

01:00:18.021 --> 01:00:19.646
That seems a little...

01:00:20.687 --> 01:00:21.687
excessive.

01:00:21.729 --> 01:00:22.729
Doesn't it, though?

01:00:23.354 --> 01:00:24.354
Yeah.

01:00:26.646 --> 01:00:28.604
What can you tell me about her husband?

01:00:29.437 --> 01:00:30.729
I've never met the man.

01:00:31.521 --> 01:00:33.604
So you had nothing to do with hiring him?

01:00:34.812 --> 01:00:36.646
As a gardener at the house.

01:00:38.187 --> 01:00:42.021
No. It's strictly against our policy
for family members to work together.

01:00:42.104 --> 01:00:44.937
Our patients are elderly, infirm.

01:00:45.021 --> 01:00:48.229
We can't risk that kind
of potential distraction.

01:00:48.479 --> 01:00:53.021
So, do you know of Ms. Franklin
ever breaking the rules before?

01:00:53.104 --> 01:00:54.229
Never, no.

01:00:54.687 --> 01:00:58.104
No, she absolutely understood
the importance of her job, especially...

01:00:58.729 --> 01:00:59.729
with Mr. Wellsley.

01:00:59.979 --> 01:01:00.979
Why especially him?

01:01:01.437 --> 01:01:06.521
Well, you wouldn't have known it to look
at him, but his health was very delicate.

01:01:07.062 --> 01:01:09.146
You know, Katie told me,
she kept a notebook,

01:01:09.229 --> 01:01:12.021
like, a daily log,
just to keep track of his medication.

01:01:12.396 --> 01:01:15.437
Do you happen to have
a record of his medications?

01:01:16.771 --> 01:01:19.354
You'd have to speak
with his doctor about that.

01:01:19.437 --> 01:01:22.896
Right. How about Ms. Franklin's contract,
how much she was being paid?

01:01:25.271 --> 01:01:27.646
Yeah, sure, we can get that to you.

01:01:27.729 --> 01:01:30.604
- Yeah.
- Excellent. Thank you. And let me...

01:01:33.896 --> 01:01:36.271
just ask you. Did she...

01:01:37.521 --> 01:01:40.396
Did she ever mention a raise?

01:01:41.687 --> 01:01:42.687
Good lord.

01:01:43.146 --> 01:01:45.854
She deposited that check
just before Wellsley died.

01:01:48.479 --> 01:01:51.562
Was she really taking money
from that poor old man all along?

01:01:52.229 --> 01:01:53.396
It's a good question.

01:02:01.604 --> 01:02:02.604
Adam?

01:02:15.271 --> 01:02:16.271
Adam!

01:03:20.354 --> 01:03:21.354
Shit!

01:03:41.979 --> 01:03:42.979
Ethan?

01:03:43.937 --> 01:03:45.521
These were never cashed.

01:04:32.312 --> 01:04:33.312
You okay?

01:04:36.896 --> 01:04:38.396
I think I know who that is.

01:04:39.021 --> 01:04:40.021
What?

01:04:40.896 --> 01:04:43.937
Leonard said something
about hiring a gardener.

01:04:44.687 --> 01:04:46.271
I think I told you about this.

01:04:46.646 --> 01:04:48.062
A guy named Ethan.

01:04:48.354 --> 01:04:49.812
This was a couple years ago.

01:04:51.937 --> 01:04:53.646
So he's been up there for a while.

01:04:54.229 --> 01:04:56.812
There were checks made out to Ethan Doyle.

01:04:57.437 --> 01:04:58.771
They were never cashed.

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:01.937
Leonard said, one day,
he just stopped showing up.

01:05:02.021 --> 01:05:03.521
Never heard from him again.

01:05:06.021 --> 01:05:07.062
Somebody shot him.

01:05:10.437 --> 01:05:11.437
You looked?

01:05:15.521 --> 01:05:17.354
He must have bled to death up there.

01:05:19.104 --> 01:05:20.104
He was murdered.

01:05:21.146 --> 01:05:22.729
Yeah. I think so.

01:05:25.812 --> 01:05:26.812
But...

01:05:27.312 --> 01:05:29.396
Leonard couldn't have known
he was there.

01:05:29.937 --> 01:05:31.937
Right? I mean,
he would have helped him.

01:05:32.479 --> 01:05:36.271
And why would Doyle hide out in the shed?
Why not... come into the house?

01:05:43.187 --> 01:05:45.187
Maybe these have something
to do with it.

01:05:50.937 --> 01:05:51.937
Take a guess.

01:05:53.271 --> 01:05:54.271
Wow.

01:05:58.354 --> 01:06:00.771
- Do you think they're real?
- Why else would he hide them?

01:06:02.687 --> 01:06:03.687
Shit!

01:06:04.021 --> 01:06:05.396
Here! Just--

01:06:06.729 --> 01:06:08.437
- Oh, God!
- Oh, my God.

01:06:08.521 --> 01:06:09.646
Give them here. Come on.

01:06:09.729 --> 01:06:10.771
- I'm sorry.
- Dammit.

01:06:10.854 --> 01:06:12.640
- Don't answer.
- I saw your car.

01:06:12.646 --> 01:06:15.187
But I can't. My car is parked outside.
They know I'm here.

01:06:16.146 --> 01:06:17.729
- Okay, I'm just gonna...
- I got it.

01:06:17.812 --> 01:06:19.937
Open the door!
Do you hear me? Katie!

01:06:21.229 --> 01:06:23.187
Katie, open the door please!

01:06:24.396 --> 01:06:26.036
I'm sorry.
This really isn't a good time.

01:06:26.104 --> 01:06:29.146
Well, yeah. I'm sure you're very busy
settling into your new home.

01:06:29.229 --> 01:06:30.646
You should be ashamed of yourself.

01:06:30.729 --> 01:06:32.979
How could you take advantage
of that poor man?

01:06:33.062 --> 01:06:34.687
- What?
- Look, I knew something was up.

01:06:34.771 --> 01:06:35.771
I could feel it.

01:06:35.812 --> 01:06:38.646
But you know what? You had him
so frightened he couldn't even tell me.

01:06:38.729 --> 01:06:40.021
It's not-- No!

01:06:40.104 --> 01:06:42.104
I'm not letting you
tarnish my company's good name.

01:06:42.146 --> 01:06:43.466
- Mr. Calvern--
- I'll find proof!

01:06:43.521 --> 01:06:44.854
I'm gonna call the police!

01:06:44.937 --> 01:06:47.417
- I'm gonna have you arrested!
- This really isn't a good time.

01:06:49.187 --> 01:06:50.687
<b>This isn't over, Katie!

01:06:50.937 --> 01:06:51.937
I'll be back!

01:06:53.646 --> 01:06:57.312
I'm gonna find out what's been going on
in this house, one way or another!

01:06:57.687 --> 01:07:02.104
I'm not letting this go! You hear me?
I'm not gonna lose my business over this!

01:07:41.104 --> 01:07:42.521
Why isn't this full?

01:07:59.396 --> 01:08:00.396
Katie?

01:08:02.937 --> 01:08:03.937
Hey, Katie!

01:08:06.979 --> 01:08:07.979
Hey.

01:08:08.562 --> 01:08:10.896
- Didn't you hear me?
- Hi, sorry. I was making tea.

01:08:11.229 --> 01:08:12.229
You want some?

01:08:12.854 --> 01:08:14.271
No. I got you a present.

01:08:16.145 --> 01:08:17.145
A new phone?

01:08:17.854 --> 01:08:19.687
Yeah. Got one for each of us.

01:08:20.437 --> 01:08:22.770
New numbers too. I figured
the way things were going,

01:08:22.854 --> 01:08:24.354
we could both use a little privacy.

01:08:31.562 --> 01:08:33.104
We can't keep them.

01:08:35.854 --> 01:08:37.062
- Katie--
- Adam, no.

01:08:37.854 --> 01:08:41.687
There is a dead man out there.
He was murdered.

01:08:42.354 --> 01:08:43.562
He stole those diamonds.

01:08:43.645 --> 01:08:46.854
And who knows what else
he may have done, who he may have hurt.

01:08:47.812 --> 01:08:50.520
These things don't just go away
like they never happened.

01:08:50.604 --> 01:08:53.520
- The police must be looking for him.
- Don't you get this?

01:08:53.895 --> 01:08:55.187
Doyle stole the diamonds,

01:08:55.604 --> 01:08:58.604
got himself shot,
and then he died out there all by himself.

01:08:58.729 --> 01:09:00.854
It's like-- It's like he fell down a well.

01:09:02.937 --> 01:09:03.854
Two years later,

01:09:03.937 --> 01:09:07.895
nobody knows what happened to him or
the diamonds. We can do whatever we want.

01:09:11.104 --> 01:09:13.687
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling Detective Chesler.

01:09:13.770 --> 01:09:15.562
- We need to tell her--
- No! Wait!

01:09:15.645 --> 01:09:19.687
Wait, just-- Okay, hang on.
Just listen to me for just a second.

01:09:20.354 --> 01:09:24.145
Okay, ask yourself. What the heck
was Doyle doing here in the first place?

01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:26.312
Why take some crappy gardening job

01:09:26.395 --> 01:09:28.854
if he's planning to steal a fortune
in diamonds?

01:09:29.437 --> 01:09:30.437
I don't know.

01:09:31.145 --> 01:09:33.270
Some old guy's house digging up weeds

01:09:33.354 --> 01:09:36.104
is the last place
that anybody's gonna come looking for him.

01:09:36.395 --> 01:09:38.796
I mean, think about it.
Why else wouldn't he cash the checks?

01:09:40.270 --> 01:09:42.104
He didn't want to leave a paper trail.

01:09:42.937 --> 01:09:44.729
That way he sets up the big score.

01:09:45.062 --> 01:09:48.145
Nobody knows about this place
and he can just hide here

01:09:48.479 --> 01:09:49.895
for as long as he needs to.

01:09:50.812 --> 01:09:53.645
Although, I'm sure
that getting shot and dying out there

01:09:53.729 --> 01:09:56.490
- was probably not a part of the plan.
- That doesn't change anything.

01:09:56.562 --> 01:09:58.354
We can't keep those diamonds.

01:09:58.437 --> 01:10:00.229
All right, so what about the money?

01:10:01.229 --> 01:10:02.562
What are we gonna do about that?

01:10:02.646 --> 01:10:03.521
What do you mean?

01:10:03.604 --> 01:10:06.771
If we do this,
then the police put us under a microscope,

01:10:06.854 --> 01:10:08.229
so how is that going to look?

01:10:08.312 --> 01:10:10.646
We took the money from here
and then we hid it in the bank.

01:10:10.729 --> 01:10:11.769
What are they gonna think?

01:10:11.812 --> 01:10:13.312
We'll explain it to them.

01:10:14.146 --> 01:10:17.021
Tell them it was Leonard's money,
that it was his safety net.

01:10:17.104 --> 01:10:18.187
All right, and then what?

01:10:18.312 --> 01:10:20.896
'Cause you heard what the lawyer said.
Even if they believe us,

01:10:20.979 --> 01:10:24.562
even if we don't end up in jail,
we could still lose this place.

01:10:24.646 --> 01:10:26.521
We don't need this house, Adam!

01:10:27.062 --> 01:10:28.562
We don't need any of this.

01:10:28.937 --> 01:10:31.687
Okay? As long as we have each other,

01:10:32.021 --> 01:10:33.141
we're going to be all right.

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:34.229
All right?

01:10:34.937 --> 01:10:36.146
I'm done with all right.

01:10:37.437 --> 01:10:38.729
That's not enough anymore.

01:10:38.812 --> 01:10:41.229
I told you. I'm not going back
to the way things were before.

01:10:41.312 --> 01:10:44.437
And what about that man out there?
What are we supposed to do about that?

01:10:45.062 --> 01:10:46.812
Pretend it never happened?

01:10:46.896 --> 01:10:47.979
I'll take care of it.

01:10:48.521 --> 01:10:50.687
How? How are you gonna do that?

01:10:52.937 --> 01:10:53.937
This house

01:10:54.187 --> 01:10:55.229
belongs to us now.

01:10:55.812 --> 01:10:57.062
Okay, this is our future.

01:10:58.021 --> 01:11:00.312
I'm not gonna let anybody
take that away from us.

01:11:06.479 --> 01:11:08.187
Look, everything is gonna be okay.

01:11:13.687 --> 01:11:15.271
I'll take care of this for you.

01:12:48.854 --> 01:12:50.134
<b>What are you doing?

01:12:51.187 --> 01:12:52.627
<b>Someone's in the house.

01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:55.896
<b>Where did you get that?

01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:09.229
<b>Adam.

01:13:09.354 --> 01:13:11.687
- Don't.
- Don't move.

01:13:11.771 --> 01:13:13.437
<b>We need to call 911.

01:13:27.896 --> 01:13:28.896
Freeze, asshole!

01:13:37.271 --> 01:13:38.271
Oh, my God.

01:13:39.354 --> 01:13:40.354
Calvern.

01:13:57.104 --> 01:13:58.229
Where's the girl?

01:14:03.562 --> 01:14:05.187
How are you holding up, Katie?

01:14:06.729 --> 01:14:08.062
Detective Chesler.

01:14:09.729 --> 01:14:10.729
Hell of a thing.

01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:15.229
It was an accident.

01:14:15.687 --> 01:14:17.396
Yeah, that's what they're saying.

01:14:19.354 --> 01:14:21.896
Either way,
law says it's self-defense, so...

01:14:23.479 --> 01:14:25.229
It still makes you wonder.

01:14:25.854 --> 01:14:27.854
What was going through his head?

01:14:28.562 --> 01:14:30.396
Why would he do something like that?

01:14:31.104 --> 01:14:33.354
Just let himself into the house?

01:14:33.729 --> 01:14:34.729
I don't know.

01:14:41.062 --> 01:14:42.937
Something had to set him off.

01:14:46.937 --> 01:14:48.479
I know none of this is you, Katie.

01:14:50.354 --> 01:14:51.187
What?

01:14:51.271 --> 01:14:54.229
Everything was fine around here
until Adam started work.

01:14:55.146 --> 01:14:57.771
So you can tell me whatever is going on.

01:14:58.187 --> 01:14:59.687
I know that none of it is you.

01:15:00.104 --> 01:15:02.104
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:15:02.354 --> 01:15:04.062
I know about your money problems.

01:15:04.979 --> 01:15:06.312
I know what that does to people.

01:15:07.021 --> 01:15:10.187
I know about the big check
that you deposited from Mr. Wellsley.

01:15:10.271 --> 01:15:11.604
You don't understand.

01:15:11.687 --> 01:15:13.604
Okay, don't say anything, Katie. Just--

01:15:13.687 --> 01:15:14.937
Just listen for a second.

01:15:15.729 --> 01:15:16.729
Because...

01:15:17.396 --> 01:15:18.562
could be that...

01:15:19.979 --> 01:15:20.979
it was a loan,

01:15:21.062 --> 01:15:22.771
maybe it was a gift, who's to say?

01:15:22.979 --> 01:15:25.146
But I want you
to put yourself in my shoes.

01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:26.312
The big picture.

01:15:26.937 --> 01:15:29.937
How all of a sudden,
everything just drops in your lap.

01:15:30.021 --> 01:15:31.812
- I told you--
- I mean, here I am,

01:15:32.729 --> 01:15:35.604
the coroner tells me
that the old guy died in his sleep.

01:15:35.896 --> 01:15:39.812
You tell me what his last wish was.
And I figure, sure, why not?

01:15:40.271 --> 01:15:43.187
But it is not until after he's cremated

01:15:44.312 --> 01:15:45.312
that you find a will.

01:15:45.729 --> 01:15:48.146
I didn't find it,
I didn't even know about it.

01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:50.146
And I don't even have a body.

01:15:51.271 --> 01:15:54.271
I can't even prove
that he didn't die a natural death.

01:15:57.937 --> 01:16:00.521
I mean I gotta tell you,
it's starting to keep me up at night.

01:16:00.812 --> 01:16:02.687
I would never hurt Leonard.

01:16:02.771 --> 01:16:04.229
I am not talking about you.

01:16:04.812 --> 01:16:05.812
What?

01:16:06.354 --> 01:16:11.604
Has Adam ever mentioned anyone
by the name of Gaskin, a Ray Gaskin?

01:16:15.021 --> 01:16:16.604
I know that name.

01:16:16.687 --> 01:16:18.407
'Cause he tried to rob
the diner that night,

01:16:18.687 --> 01:16:21.354
and he also worked as a janitor
at the university

01:16:21.437 --> 01:16:23.187
while Adam was taking classes.

01:16:23.687 --> 01:16:25.521
- No, that's not... No.
- Okay.

01:16:26.104 --> 01:16:28.562
It's a big school.
Maybe they never met.

01:16:30.104 --> 01:16:31.229
But sooner or later...

01:16:32.771 --> 01:16:33.937
Adam is going to screw up.

01:16:34.396 --> 01:16:35.854
It's only a matter of time.

01:16:36.312 --> 01:16:38.562
Don't let him take you down with him.

01:16:38.854 --> 01:16:40.021
You come to me.

01:16:46.229 --> 01:16:47.229
Baby.

01:16:49.562 --> 01:16:50.562
They wanna talk to you.

01:17:10.354 --> 01:17:11.396
Hell of a thing.

01:17:28.604 --> 01:17:29.646
- Katie!
- Hey.

01:17:30.062 --> 01:17:32.937
I heard what happened. Are you all right?
I've been trying to call you.

01:17:33.021 --> 01:17:34.062
My number's been changed.

01:17:35.062 --> 01:17:36.229
I need to talk to you.

01:17:37.771 --> 01:17:39.354
- Yeah. Come upstairs.
- Okay.

01:17:40.979 --> 01:17:43.604
And this Detective Chesler,
do you believe her?

01:17:43.812 --> 01:17:45.687
Is it possible that
Adam had anything to do

01:17:45.771 --> 01:17:47.451
with what happened
at the diner that night?

01:17:47.479 --> 01:17:48.854
I don't know what to believe.

01:17:51.312 --> 01:17:54.604
Did Adam have any problems
with Mr. Wellsley?

01:17:55.146 --> 01:17:56.187
- Any issues?
- No.

01:17:57.479 --> 01:17:59.021
No, nothing.

01:18:00.312 --> 01:18:03.646
If the police suspect that Adam
had anything to do with his death,

01:18:04.521 --> 01:18:06.229
they'll try to find a motive.

01:18:06.312 --> 01:18:09.271
They're gonna try to claim
that he hurried things along.

01:18:11.854 --> 01:18:13.354
He hated being poor.

01:18:13.771 --> 01:18:14.854
Okay, listen to me.

01:18:14.937 --> 01:18:18.062
If Chesler thinks she can make a case,
she's not gonna waste any time.

01:18:18.146 --> 01:18:20.771
She's gonna try to get a warrant
and search the house right away.

01:18:20.854 --> 01:18:21.854
Can she do that?

01:18:21.896 --> 01:18:25.021
You need to be asking yourself,
will she find anything?

01:18:30.062 --> 01:18:31.396
You need to promise me.

01:18:33.312 --> 01:18:34.312
Promise me

01:18:34.854 --> 01:18:36.396
that you'll help Adam too.

01:18:44.937 --> 01:18:45.937
It's gone.

01:18:46.187 --> 01:18:47.187
What?

01:18:49.604 --> 01:18:50.604
The money.

01:18:51.604 --> 01:18:52.812
Adam must have taken it.

01:18:53.771 --> 01:18:55.729
That's what you found? Cash?

01:18:58.479 --> 01:18:59.937
Yeah...

01:19:01.604 --> 01:19:03.021
Almost $100,000...

01:19:03.771 --> 01:19:04.771
in the attic.

01:19:05.729 --> 01:19:07.771
We thought it was stolen at first but...

01:19:07.896 --> 01:19:09.354
And then what changed your mind?

01:19:12.146 --> 01:19:13.146
The diamonds.

01:19:14.646 --> 01:19:16.812
So you found diamonds in the house?

01:19:17.646 --> 01:19:19.646
In the living space above the garage.

01:19:24.354 --> 01:19:26.604
Does Adam have these diamonds?

01:19:28.146 --> 01:19:29.146
Yeah.

01:19:30.437 --> 01:19:31.521
You need to stop him.

01:19:33.062 --> 01:19:34.062
What? Why?

01:19:34.271 --> 01:19:36.671
He knows you suspect something.
That's why he took the money.

01:19:36.729 --> 01:19:38.369
He disappears and throws you to the cops.

01:19:38.396 --> 01:19:40.396
No, Adam would never do that.

01:19:40.479 --> 01:19:41.479
Are you sure?

01:19:43.437 --> 01:19:46.687
You need to find him, bring him
to the house and then call me.

01:19:47.604 --> 01:19:50.396
- You're not coming with me?
- I need to hold off Detective Chesler.

01:19:50.479 --> 01:19:52.159
I don't want her serving
the search warrant

01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:53.549
till we know Adam's in the house.

01:20:17.104 --> 01:20:19.021
- Detective Chesler.
- Detective Johnson.

01:20:19.354 --> 01:20:20.354
What have we got?

01:20:20.521 --> 01:20:23.771
Garbage truck was making its rounds
this morning, called it in.

01:20:23.854 --> 01:20:26.521
- How long's he been in there?
- ME's still en route.

01:20:27.146 --> 01:20:28.146
You beat him here.

01:20:29.604 --> 01:20:30.604
Damn.

01:20:31.562 --> 01:20:32.562
Why did you call me?

01:20:33.729 --> 01:20:35.604
There was a backpack next to the vic.

01:20:35.979 --> 01:20:38.021
Inside we found an old laundry receipt.

01:20:38.854 --> 01:20:40.271
It's pretty faded, but...

01:20:40.687 --> 01:20:43.271
the address matches the name
from one of your cases.

01:20:43.562 --> 01:20:44.562
What's the name?

01:20:44.896 --> 01:20:45.896
Leonard Wellsley.

01:21:04.437 --> 01:21:06.646
Come on, Adam, pick up.

01:21:18.062 --> 01:21:19.729
- Where've you been?
- Adam!

01:21:19.937 --> 01:21:21.896
I'm up half the night talking to the cops.

01:21:21.979 --> 01:21:24.021
I wake up in the morning,
you're already gone.

01:21:24.104 --> 01:21:26.687
There's no note.
You haven't answered your phone all day.

01:21:26.771 --> 01:21:29.187
- Where've you been, Katie?
- The bank.

01:21:29.437 --> 01:21:31.521
That's one of the things
I need to talk to you about.

01:21:32.146 --> 01:21:34.812
- Why did you take the money?
- Cause we're in a lot of trouble.

01:21:34.896 --> 01:21:37.104
Checked up on that real estate agent,
Hayden.

01:21:37.229 --> 01:21:38.687
I mean, what's this guy's deal?

01:21:38.771 --> 01:21:41.021
Why's he so interested
in selling this particular house?

01:21:41.521 --> 01:21:42.521
Guess what?

01:21:42.604 --> 01:21:45.244
There's no record of a Mickey Hayden
getting a real estate license.

01:21:45.271 --> 01:21:47.437
- What?
- Yeah. He just got released from prison.

01:21:47.521 --> 01:21:49.437
Did a couple years
for robbing a jewelry store.

01:21:50.187 --> 01:21:51.021
Jewelry?

01:21:51.104 --> 01:21:53.396
One of those spots downtown.
Doesn't even use a gun.

01:21:53.479 --> 01:21:56.062
He just sweet talks his way
through the security door,

01:21:56.146 --> 01:21:57.979
then he blindsides the armed guard,

01:21:58.062 --> 01:22:00.646
does some old school,
like, smash-and-grab.

01:22:00.729 --> 01:22:03.729
Sixty seconds,
comes out with three million dollars

01:22:03.812 --> 01:22:05.646
in loose diamonds
that were never recovered.

01:22:06.396 --> 01:22:08.979
- That's why he was here.
- Hang on, it gets better.

01:22:09.062 --> 01:22:11.729
Cops think that he had an accomplice
that they never found.

01:22:11.812 --> 01:22:13.146
You wanna take a wild guess?

01:22:14.604 --> 01:22:17.312
This other guy gets shot during
the burglary, then he gets away.

01:22:17.812 --> 01:22:19.479
Doyle got away with the diamonds.

01:22:20.979 --> 01:22:21.979
And...

01:22:22.646 --> 01:22:25.104
there's only one other person
who could've known about it.

01:22:26.187 --> 01:22:27.271
The one who shot him.

01:22:30.021 --> 01:22:30.854
Hayden.

01:22:30.937 --> 01:22:33.497
This bastard didn't bother
to use a fake name. What did he think?

01:22:33.521 --> 01:22:35.161
We weren't smart enough to figure it out?

01:22:35.187 --> 01:22:36.437
We have to call the police.

01:22:36.521 --> 01:22:39.937
No, the only thing that we need to do
is get the hell out of Dodge.

01:22:40.021 --> 01:22:41.979
We got plenty of travel money, so...

01:22:42.062 --> 01:22:43.896
сan you go pack some stuff up real fast?

01:22:43.979 --> 01:22:45.312
I'm gonna go get cleaned up.

01:22:47.146 --> 01:22:48.646
You were never gonna leave me.

01:22:50.812 --> 01:22:52.687
What? No, why would I ever leave you?

01:22:56.646 --> 01:22:57.646
Get changed.

01:23:18.354 --> 01:23:19.396
Hi, Julia.

01:23:19.854 --> 01:23:20.854
It's Katie.

01:23:22.271 --> 01:23:23.771
Yeah, he's here, but...

01:23:24.187 --> 01:23:25.604
listen, it wasn't him.

01:23:30.062 --> 01:23:31.062
Where are they?

01:23:32.812 --> 01:23:33.812
I don't know.

01:23:34.229 --> 01:23:35.354
Call him out here.

01:23:40.271 --> 01:23:41.271
Adam?

01:23:43.021 --> 01:23:44.021
Adam?

01:23:48.937 --> 01:23:49.937
Adam!

01:23:52.396 --> 01:23:53.604
Right here, baby.

01:23:54.771 --> 01:23:55.604
Let her go.

01:23:55.687 --> 01:23:57.271
Look, I just want the diamonds.

01:23:57.354 --> 01:23:58.354
I said let her go.

01:23:59.521 --> 01:24:01.479
I've been waiting a long time for this.

01:24:01.979 --> 01:24:03.854
So how about
you just tell me where they are?

01:24:03.937 --> 01:24:05.562
Some place you're never gonna find them.

01:24:07.312 --> 01:24:08.729
Are you gonna shoot me, kid?

01:24:09.437 --> 01:24:10.437
That's right.

01:24:10.687 --> 01:24:13.207
'Cause if I just give you the diamonds,
you'll shoot both of us.

01:24:13.271 --> 01:24:14.562
Here's the thing though.

01:24:15.062 --> 01:24:16.729
Even if you hit me from there...

01:24:17.812 --> 01:24:21.437
my gun's gonna go off, and it's gonna
blow a hole in her the size of your head.

01:24:21.521 --> 01:24:23.896
And we don't want that now, do we?

01:24:24.604 --> 01:24:26.729
So, let's just talk about this.

01:24:30.729 --> 01:24:31.854
Adam!

01:24:55.229 --> 01:24:56.896
Son of a bitch.

01:25:08.396 --> 01:25:09.396
Adam!

01:25:10.354 --> 01:25:11.354
No!

01:25:11.396 --> 01:25:12.396
Adam!

01:25:13.187 --> 01:25:14.229
Baby...

01:25:14.521 --> 01:25:15.521
Adam!

01:25:15.979 --> 01:25:16.979
Baby!

01:25:17.187 --> 01:25:18.021
Please.

01:25:18.104 --> 01:25:19.104
Adam.

01:25:21.812 --> 01:25:22.896
...in the garden.

01:25:22.979 --> 01:25:24.271
Stay with me, baby.

01:25:44.396 --> 01:25:45.396
Katie.

01:25:49.687 --> 01:25:50.687
Oh, my God.

01:25:54.771 --> 01:25:55.979
Here, Katie.

01:26:00.312 --> 01:26:01.312
I'm sorry.

01:26:02.562 --> 01:26:03.562
Here, sit.

01:26:07.187 --> 01:26:08.187
Hey.

01:26:10.104 --> 01:26:11.146
Katie, listen.

01:26:12.479 --> 01:26:15.479
We need to look for the diamonds
before the police get here.

01:26:15.562 --> 01:26:16.562
Do you understand?

01:26:17.437 --> 01:26:20.354
It's the only way we can explain
what happened without implicating you.

01:26:24.021 --> 01:26:27.062
- Adam never would have hurt Leonard.
- Katie, the diamonds.

01:26:27.146 --> 01:26:29.354
How could I have ever thought that?

01:26:30.562 --> 01:26:31.562
It was Hayden.

01:26:33.437 --> 01:26:34.437
Hayden...

01:26:34.646 --> 01:26:36.979
killed him with an overdose.

01:26:38.187 --> 01:26:41.354
He read the logbook, the one
I kept for Leonard's medication.

01:26:43.062 --> 01:26:44.521
I found the empty pill bottle.

01:26:44.854 --> 01:26:46.187
How do you know it was Hayden?

01:26:46.812 --> 01:26:49.937
Leonard used to tell me all the time
that he could hear someone in the house,

01:26:50.021 --> 01:26:51.687
but I never-- I...

01:26:52.604 --> 01:26:53.604
It was Hayden.

01:26:54.479 --> 01:26:55.896
Looking for the diamonds.

01:26:56.604 --> 01:26:58.437
- He couldn't find them.
- But you did?

01:26:59.396 --> 01:27:00.521
I don't understand.

01:27:03.312 --> 01:27:05.521
Why did Hayden shoot Doyle?

01:27:06.437 --> 01:27:09.771
Why didn't--
Why didn't he end up with the diamonds?

01:27:12.021 --> 01:27:14.604
Because he wasn't half as smart
as he wanted you to think.

01:27:17.271 --> 01:27:21.062
I mean how smart do you have to be
to decide to rip off your partner,

01:27:21.146 --> 01:27:23.354
shoot him while the cops are rolling up,

01:27:23.521 --> 01:27:26.646
and he still gets away
with three million dollars in diamonds?

01:27:27.396 --> 01:27:30.229
Meanwhile, you get busted
and spend two years in prison.

01:27:41.771 --> 01:27:44.229
I never told you how much
the diamonds are worth.

01:27:51.562 --> 01:27:52.562
Oops.

01:27:55.437 --> 01:27:58.396
- What are you doing?
- Look, okay, I paid my dues.

01:27:58.896 --> 01:28:00.979
Okay, I spent ten years
as a public defender.

01:28:01.521 --> 01:28:03.062
How do you think I got Hayden's case?

01:28:03.729 --> 01:28:04.896
I knew he was an idiot.

01:28:05.271 --> 01:28:06.437
But I believed his story.

01:28:07.146 --> 01:28:10.521
And we had an agreement, an understanding,
and, of course, he messes everything up.

01:28:10.812 --> 01:28:12.979
I plea bargained his charges
down to two years.

01:28:13.062 --> 01:28:15.187
I traced Doyle back to
when he worked for Leonard.

01:28:15.271 --> 01:28:17.521
But the only thing
that I couldn't figure out

01:28:17.812 --> 01:28:19.062
was where he was.

01:28:21.437 --> 01:28:22.854
Turns out Doyle was dead.

01:28:24.562 --> 01:28:27.104
You helped kill Leonard?

01:28:27.187 --> 01:28:31.604
No, I had nothing to do with that, okay?
That was all Hayden. He got impatient.

01:28:31.687 --> 01:28:35.146
He wanted to hurry things along,
but I did have to do some fast maneuvering

01:28:35.229 --> 01:28:36.396
to cover up for him.

01:28:38.854 --> 01:28:39.854
The will.

01:28:42.271 --> 01:28:43.521
It isn't real, is it?

01:28:43.604 --> 01:28:44.604
It's real enough.

01:28:45.146 --> 01:28:47.604
With no one to contest it,
what's the difference?

01:28:48.187 --> 01:28:50.896
Look, I'm sure Leonard would've given you
the house if he was alive,

01:28:50.979 --> 01:28:52.646
but that is beside the point.

01:28:53.521 --> 01:28:57.146
Right now, I need you to tell me
where the diamonds are.

01:28:59.479 --> 01:29:00.479
I don't know.

01:29:04.021 --> 01:29:05.021
Katie.

01:29:05.604 --> 01:29:06.604
Adam hid them.

01:29:07.354 --> 01:29:09.104
I really don't know where they are.

01:29:09.937 --> 01:29:11.687
But I wouldn't tell you if I did.

01:29:15.854 --> 01:29:17.694
You know,
that's what I really liked about you.

01:29:17.729 --> 01:29:19.489
<b>It was never about the money.

01:29:22.687 --> 01:29:24.146
But I'm sure they'll turn up.

01:29:25.229 --> 01:29:26.396
These things always do.

01:29:27.812 --> 01:29:29.146
- Katie?
- Detective!

01:29:31.937 --> 01:29:33.187
I'm Julia Byron-Kim.

01:29:33.687 --> 01:29:35.146
I'm Ms. Franklin's attorney.

01:29:35.937 --> 01:29:37.812
Well, Ms. Byron-Kim,

01:29:38.437 --> 01:29:40.797
I'm gonna need you to step out
so I can see both your hands.

01:29:40.812 --> 01:29:43.312
If you just give me a minute
to explain on behalf of my client.

01:29:43.396 --> 01:29:44.896
Show me your hands. Right now!

01:29:44.979 --> 01:29:46.604
All right.

01:29:46.687 --> 01:29:49.021
- Detective, if you would just listen--
- Look out!

01:30:02.771 --> 01:30:03.771
Stay back.

01:30:09.646 --> 01:30:10.646
Are you okay?

01:30:11.354 --> 01:30:12.396
Are you okay?

01:30:12.937 --> 01:30:14.687
You're okay, sweetie.
You're okay.

01:30:15.562 --> 01:30:16.562
Come on.

01:30:18.646 --> 01:30:20.646
Come on.
Let's get you out of here, come on.

01:30:25.521 --> 01:30:26.979
This is Detective Chesler.

01:30:28.021 --> 01:30:30.479
I'm requesting a back-up
and an ambulance

01:30:30.771 --> 01:30:32.104
at 127 Queens.

01:30:35.104 --> 01:30:38.854
FOUR MONTHS LATER

01:30:56.104 --> 01:30:57.104
Katie.

01:30:59.771 --> 01:31:00.896
- Hey.
- Detective.

01:31:01.187 --> 01:31:02.771
Sorry, I tried knocking.

01:31:04.896 --> 01:31:05.896
Sorry, I was...

01:31:06.646 --> 01:31:07.896
a million miles away.

01:31:08.187 --> 01:31:09.187
A young cedar.

01:31:09.396 --> 01:31:10.521
This is a nice spot.

01:31:10.937 --> 01:31:13.146
- Lots of sun.
- Yeah, I think so.

01:31:14.354 --> 01:31:16.354
- It's good to see you.
- And it's good to see you.

01:31:19.354 --> 01:31:20.521
You look beautiful.

01:31:20.854 --> 01:31:21.687
Thank you.

01:31:21.854 --> 01:31:22.896
Yeah, we're...

01:31:23.646 --> 01:31:24.646
We're doing well.

01:31:26.146 --> 01:31:30.479
Well I just came by to let you know
that the case is officially closed.

01:31:31.896 --> 01:31:35.479
Mickey Hayden and Julia Byron-Kim
are the only suspects on record.

01:31:36.146 --> 01:31:38.604
So your baby won't grow up
to someday find out

01:31:38.687 --> 01:31:40.229
her father had a criminal history.

01:31:41.687 --> 01:31:43.521
Thank you, Detective.

01:31:47.271 --> 01:31:50.229
We've been through that place
a half a dozen times,

01:31:50.562 --> 01:31:51.562
top to bottom.

01:31:53.062 --> 01:31:54.396
Still can't figure it out.

01:31:55.062 --> 01:31:56.104
He didn't tell me.

01:31:56.771 --> 01:31:59.521
I really don't know
where Adam hid the diamonds.

01:32:01.729 --> 01:32:03.354
I'm sorry, though. I wish I did.

01:32:09.062 --> 01:32:10.521
Take care of yourself, Katie.

01:32:11.521 --> 01:32:12.521
You too.
