00:00.892 --> 00:02.892
Previously on <i>Awkward...</i>

00:02.893 --> 00:04.994
- Next fall, I'd be starting
a whole new life.

00:04.996 --> 00:06.162
- I have this great photo
of you.

00:06.164 --> 00:07.730
- Nothing happened that night,
and you know it.

00:07.732 --> 00:09.966
- Is there a reason why you
haven't sent me my essay?

00:09.968 --> 00:11.234
- Matty, you want
your essay so bad,

00:11.236 --> 00:12.502
why don't you go
and get it yourself?

00:12.504 --> 00:14.937
You left something in my bed
last night, girlfriend.

00:14.939 --> 00:16.272
Nice try.

00:17.908 --> 00:19.475
- The senior ski trip
was legendary--

00:19.477 --> 00:22.078
legendary for being
less about hitting the slopes

00:22.080 --> 00:22.779
than just hitting it.

00:22.781 --> 00:24.614
The only thing
I was gonna be hitting

00:24.616 --> 00:25.882
was my ass on the snow.

00:25.884 --> 00:28.284
My boyfriend was stuck
in his dorm studying,

00:28.286 --> 00:28.951
and I could barely ski.

00:28.953 --> 00:31.921
Did I really need to be here
to watch a bunch of ski bunnies

00:31.923 --> 00:33.556
hump like bunnies?

00:33.558 --> 00:34.557
[clears throat]

00:34.559 --> 00:35.825
- [giggling]

00:35.827 --> 00:36.959
- Hey, Jenna.

00:36.961 --> 00:39.228
Do you want to sit by us?

00:44.802 --> 00:47.270
- Fair warning, big ass bus
plus windy roads

00:47.272 --> 00:48.738
gives me major
motion malfunction.

00:48.740 --> 00:52.208
You may see winter chunderland
before winter wonderland.

00:52.210 --> 00:53.009
- Lovely.

00:53.011 --> 00:54.310
- Palos Hill seniors.

00:54.312 --> 00:56.345
We are about to embark
on a journey

00:56.347 --> 01:00.149
that will rock your world
and blow your mind.

01:00.151 --> 01:01.651
[cheers and applause]

01:01.653 --> 01:05.888
Especially because I came up
with a novel social experiment

01:05.890 --> 01:08.958
to tear your walls down,
to get real.

01:08.960 --> 01:10.460
Hashtag realness.

01:10.462 --> 01:11.461
To get you ready for college

01:11.463 --> 01:14.997
with open minds, open hearts,
and open souls.

01:14.999 --> 01:17.033
- What about open orifices?

01:17.035 --> 01:17.600
[laughter]

01:17.602 --> 01:20.870
- Now, because colleges
assign the roommates randomly,

01:20.872 --> 01:24.373
I have decided to override
all of your rooming requests

01:24.375 --> 01:27.210
and assign
your roomies randomly.

01:27.212 --> 01:27.744
[all groan]

01:27.746 --> 01:30.046
Everyone needs to break out
of their cliques.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.848
Cliquishness leads to bullying,

01:31.850 --> 01:33.883
and you know how I feel
about bullying.

01:33.885 --> 01:34.650
I have zero tolerance.

01:34.652 --> 01:36.686
You keep interrupting me,
mouth breather,

01:36.688 --> 01:38.788
and I will make your life
a living hell.

01:38.790 --> 01:40.790
[indistinct muttering]

01:40.792 --> 01:41.724
Scoot over.

01:41.726 --> 01:43.526
- Who'd you get?

01:43.528 --> 01:44.460
- Gloria?

01:44.462 --> 01:45.094
- Oh, my God,

01:45.096 --> 01:47.630
Whoria Gloria,
the hookup queen?

01:47.632 --> 01:49.966
Housekeeping will need to
change her sheets

01:49.968 --> 01:50.867
every ten seconds.

01:50.869 --> 01:52.101
- Let's not be judgy.

01:52.103 --> 01:52.668
- Thank you.

01:52.670 --> 01:55.505
Do you know what it's like
being pegged in this school?

01:55.507 --> 01:56.773
It's a snake pit.

01:56.775 --> 01:58.407
- I was the suicide girl.

01:58.409 --> 01:58.841
I know.

01:58.843 --> 02:00.476
- Anyway, I'll hardly ever
be in the room.

02:00.478 --> 02:03.479
Cold weather makes me
horny as [bleep].

02:03.481 --> 02:04.180
- [scoffs]

02:04.182 --> 02:06.582
Look at that desperate deviant.

02:06.584 --> 02:08.017
How can she even
look you in the eye

02:08.019 --> 02:12.488
after leaving her skivvies
in your sheets?

02:12.490 --> 02:12.922
Wow.

02:12.924 --> 02:13.923
Look at you,
museum of tolerant.

02:13.925 --> 02:17.126
- Well, people do desperate
things when they're in love.

02:17.128 --> 02:17.727
- Oh, please.

02:17.729 --> 02:19.695
- Says the girl
who stayed up for 96 hours

02:19.697 --> 02:22.398
catfishing her boyfriend
with a bad Australian accent.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.834
- Judgy-wudgy was a bore.

02:25.602 --> 02:26.536
- Eva's his problem now.

02:26.538 --> 02:27.603
- Cute that you think that,

02:27.605 --> 02:28.871
but I'd keep my eyes open.

02:28.873 --> 02:30.573
She's really threatened by you.

02:30.575 --> 02:33.176
- Well, I'm not threatened
by her.

02:33.911 --> 02:34.677
- Ugh.

02:34.679 --> 02:35.511
Jake is all over Lissa,

02:35.513 --> 02:36.913
which is just horny desperate,

02:36.915 --> 02:39.048
the Hail Mary pass
at the Vestal Virgin.

02:39.050 --> 02:40.416
- And that's Jake's problem.

02:40.418 --> 02:41.818
Why are we spending so much time

02:41.820 --> 02:43.386
worrying about
other people's problems

02:43.388 --> 02:45.354
when we can focus on
our senior ski trip?

02:45.356 --> 02:48.357
- Okay, this whole reasonable
thing you're doing?

02:48.359 --> 02:49.258
So boring.

02:49.260 --> 02:51.894
- Matty, can you get rid of
the barnacle for a second

02:51.896 --> 02:53.329
so we can talk skiing?

02:53.331 --> 02:53.763
- Sadie.

02:53.765 --> 02:56.432
- It's fine, Matty;
She needs some time with you.

02:56.434 --> 02:57.800
I understand.

02:57.802 --> 02:59.468
- Okay, let's talk
black diamonds.

02:59.470 --> 03:01.804
- Sadie, Eva and I are
on this trip as a couple,

03:01.806 --> 03:05.374
and she's starting to pick up
on your hostility.

03:05.376 --> 03:06.242
- Oh, good.

03:06.244 --> 03:09.011
- And, to be honest,

03:09.013 --> 03:10.580
she's worried about you.

03:10.948 --> 03:13.182
That you--you might have
feelings for me.

03:13.184 --> 03:15.017
- Okay,
you can't be serious.

03:15.019 --> 03:17.954
- She told me about
your conversation.

03:17.956 --> 03:18.754
- What conversation?

03:18.756 --> 03:20.389
I don't talk to that freak.

03:20.391 --> 03:22.091
- Our kiss.

03:22.093 --> 03:25.161
How hurt you were that I didn't
think it meant anything.

03:25.163 --> 03:28.931
But I just want you to know
how much I love you, okay?

03:28.933 --> 03:30.933
As friends.

03:31.268 --> 03:33.836
It's better that we lay
all our cards out on the table

03:33.838 --> 03:35.371
and communicate our feelings.

03:35.373 --> 03:38.841
- You are so right, Matty.

03:39.042 --> 03:44.413
And now I'm going to
communicate mine.

03:44.415 --> 03:47.450
[screaming]

03:47.452 --> 03:48.751
- No, no, no!
No violence!

03:48.753 --> 03:50.553
No violence.
Zero tolerance.

03:50.555 --> 03:51.721
- Eva started it.

03:51.723 --> 03:52.388
- She's right.

03:52.390 --> 03:55.424
I don't know what I did,
but I'm sure I deserve it.

03:55.426 --> 03:56.459
- [shushing]

03:56.461 --> 03:57.727
No, no, no, sweetheart.

03:57.729 --> 03:59.362
You mustn't blame yourself.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.631
Everyone, this is
a teachable moment.

04:01.633 --> 04:05.234
The victim, the abusee,
is blaming herself

04:05.236 --> 04:08.671
for the abuser's
hatred and violence.

04:08.673 --> 04:10.273
Well, guess what?

04:10.941 --> 04:12.842
Not on my watch.

04:22.085 --> 04:24.887
- I've decided to carpe
all over this diem.

04:24.889 --> 04:25.988
This is our one and only
senior ski trip.

04:25.990 --> 04:28.524
If that means I take a walk
on the slutty side, I'm in.

04:28.526 --> 04:30.593
- You know, your hair
looks great lately.

04:30.595 --> 04:32.728
It really--it shines.

04:32.730 --> 04:33.396
- Thanks.

04:33.398 --> 04:34.697
I've been using argan oil.

04:34.699 --> 04:36.198
It gives me volume too.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.434
- I am not spending
this ski trip solo.

04:38.436 --> 04:41.170
- Not everyone's
gonna be hooking up, T.

04:41.172 --> 04:41.837
We can ski together.

04:41.839 --> 04:44.807
- The only slopes
that need riding are mine.

04:44.809 --> 04:45.641
- Hey.

04:45.643 --> 04:48.044
You guys super psyched
for our senior ski trip?

04:48.046 --> 04:49.278
- This air is oppressive.

04:49.280 --> 04:49.845
- So clean.

04:49.847 --> 04:52.615
- How are we supposed to breathe
air without toxins in it?

04:52.617 --> 04:53.582
- Dude, check out Groper.

04:53.584 --> 04:55.785
- Major meat in these woods.

04:55.787 --> 04:56.986
- Time to go hunting.

04:56.988 --> 04:58.721
Both: Hungry!

04:58.723 --> 05:01.290
- So you want to hit the slopes
with your pops?

05:01.292 --> 05:01.824
I can shred.

05:01.826 --> 05:04.126
- You know what would make this
senior ski trip super great?

05:04.128 --> 05:06.062
If I could pretend my parents
weren't on it with me.

05:06.064 --> 05:08.531
- Honey, you're going to college
in less than nine months.

05:08.533 --> 05:10.866
We don't have that much time
left together.

05:10.868 --> 05:12.435
Just ski with us.

05:13.203 --> 05:14.470
- No?
- No.

05:14.472 --> 05:15.204
- Please.
- No.

05:15.206 --> 05:17.873
- Don't worry, Ty Ty,
it won't hurt you.

05:17.875 --> 05:20.176
It's just like rain,
only cold.

05:20.178 --> 05:22.745
- I have skied in Switzerland,
dear sister.

05:22.747 --> 05:24.347
Gstaad is epic.

05:24.948 --> 05:26.315
- Tyler is so full of surprises.

05:26.317 --> 05:30.820
I didn't even know
he had a word for snow.

05:30.822 --> 05:32.321
- Hey, Tamara.

05:32.323 --> 05:33.356
Want to go for a run.

05:33.358 --> 05:34.690
- I am so up to go down.

05:34.692 --> 05:38.461
Down the mountain,
I mean, right now.

05:38.463 --> 05:39.462
- Cool.

05:39.464 --> 05:40.596
- Jenna?

05:40.598 --> 05:42.531
- I'm still psyching myself up.

05:42.533 --> 05:44.200
Go ahead.

05:44.202 --> 05:44.600
- Jenna.

05:44.602 --> 05:47.203
You remember your father saying
he would teach me to ski, right?

05:47.205 --> 05:50.439
- You remember me saying
I'd put her in ski school.

05:50.441 --> 05:51.307
- You are an old man.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.542
You cannot keep up
with Matty and Jake.

05:53.544 --> 05:55.978
- Fine, let's get on the chair.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.680
- Oh, God, the chair?

05:57.682 --> 05:59.749
No, I'm not getting
on that thing.

05:59.751 --> 06:00.516
- Well, as far as I know,

06:00.518 --> 06:02.885
that's the only way
up the mountain.

06:03.954 --> 06:04.687
- Hey, you.

06:04.689 --> 06:06.022
I need you in the singles line.

06:06.024 --> 06:07.356
- The singles line:

06:07.358 --> 06:08.124
Skiing equivalent of being

06:08.126 --> 06:11.460
the loser no one wanted to
sit with in the cafeteria.

06:11.462 --> 06:11.861
- J!

06:11.863 --> 06:13.763
You look like a sadsy over there
all by yourself.

06:13.765 --> 06:16.032
You want to go on a run
with Biggie and me?

06:16.034 --> 06:16.866
- No, thanks.

06:16.868 --> 06:17.833
I'm waiting for someone.

06:17.835 --> 06:18.601
- It's not freshies,

06:18.603 --> 06:21.070
but any snow is good snow,
right?

06:21.072 --> 06:23.439
Welcome to my mountain,
and be safe.

06:23.441 --> 06:25.307
- Whoa, hey, freshie.

06:25.309 --> 06:27.076
No bear paws in my honey pot.

06:27.078 --> 06:27.576
- [growls]

06:27.578 --> 06:30.579
- Oh, hey, look,
it's the three musketeers.

06:30.581 --> 06:32.581
You want to come shred
with your folks?

06:32.583 --> 06:33.416
- No, thanks.

06:33.418 --> 06:35.484
I'm--I'm good.

06:35.486 --> 06:36.886
- Come on, cupcake.

06:36.888 --> 06:40.056
- Kevin. Kev--hel--help me.

06:40.058 --> 06:42.758
- My snow adventure
was already a meltdown.

06:42.760 --> 06:44.593
I really needed some TLC.

06:44.595 --> 06:47.296
- Oh, there we go.

06:47.298 --> 06:49.432
There we go.

06:56.006 --> 06:59.508
- Hey, beautiful.

06:59.510 --> 07:00.810
- It was like magic.

07:00.812 --> 07:02.044
He was like magic.

07:02.046 --> 07:04.814
Suddenly, I had
my mountain high.

07:05.849 --> 07:06.248
Oh!

07:06.250 --> 07:07.950
- That's it.
- Oh, my God.

07:07.952 --> 07:10.086
- That's it.
- Oh, my God.

07:10.088 --> 07:11.287
- You got it.

07:11.289 --> 07:12.221
Yes.

07:12.223 --> 07:13.989
You're skiing.

07:13.991 --> 07:15.024
This is it.

07:15.026 --> 07:18.394
[screams]

07:19.763 --> 07:23.399
You know, for a beginner,
you're really a beginner.

07:23.401 --> 07:25.267
- Well, luckily
there is lots of time

07:25.269 --> 07:28.370
before the next Winter Olympics.

07:28.372 --> 07:28.771
Hey.

07:28.773 --> 07:30.339
Oh, you guys
made it down faster,

07:30.341 --> 07:31.874
but we all end up
in the same place.

07:31.876 --> 07:34.243
- Jenna, we've been down
four times.

07:39.149 --> 07:42.351
- [screams]

07:42.353 --> 07:43.486
- You okay?
- Yeah.

07:43.488 --> 07:48.824
- Okay?
- Yeah.

07:48.826 --> 07:54.163
- Oops.

07:54.165 --> 07:55.297
Since the essay
misunderstanding,

07:55.299 --> 07:57.399
so maybe it was time
to be on more solid ground,

07:57.401 --> 07:59.468
even if we were
hanging by a cable

07:59.470 --> 08:00.436
8 million feet in the air.

08:00.438 --> 08:03.472
Eva and Luke certainly
seem to be hitting it off.

08:03.474 --> 08:04.773
- She can talk to anyone.

08:04.775 --> 08:07.676
- She always has
so much to talk about.

08:07.678 --> 08:08.444
- What does that mean?

08:08.446 --> 08:10.646
- I didn't mean it
to come out that way.

08:10.648 --> 08:11.247
Or did I?

08:11.249 --> 08:13.249
There was definitely
some weirdness with Eva,

08:13.251 --> 08:15.084
but it wasn't gonna do me
any good

08:15.086 --> 08:16.018
to get into it with Matty.

08:16.020 --> 08:17.353
- I didn't mean anything.

08:17.355 --> 08:19.221
She's just...

08:19.223 --> 08:19.755
Interesting.

08:19.757 --> 08:21.056
- Jenna, do you have a problem
with Eva?

08:21.058 --> 08:24.293
- She's a lying slunt,
and that's where she lives.

08:24.295 --> 08:27.163
- I didn't know I was
driving you to a catfight.

08:27.165 --> 08:28.164
I would have charged more.

08:28.166 --> 08:29.565
- You're charging me?

08:29.567 --> 08:30.866
That's rude.

08:30.868 --> 08:32.334
- Just gas.

08:32.336 --> 08:33.669
Maybe a neck rub.

08:33.671 --> 08:34.737
You stress me, Sadita.

08:34.739 --> 08:37.106
You're so uptight all the time,
it's contagious.

08:37.108 --> 08:37.973
- There won't be a catfight,

08:37.975 --> 08:40.776
because that ratchet whore
is on the ski trip.

08:40.778 --> 08:42.912
- Then what are we doing here?

08:42.914 --> 08:45.814
- I just need some intel.

08:45.816 --> 08:46.515
And stay in the truck.

08:46.517 --> 08:48.884
- What, you don't want to be
seen with me?

08:49.019 --> 08:51.053
- This isn't a good neighborhood
for you.

08:51.055 --> 08:53.255
- Jenna, she already told me
all of this,

08:53.257 --> 08:55.357
but she said that you showed up
at school

08:55.359 --> 08:57.393
and accused us
of having sex in your bed.

08:57.395 --> 08:58.260
- That's not what happened.

08:58.262 --> 08:59.762
I just told you
I would never think that.

08:59.764 --> 09:01.163
That's what she wanted me
to believe.

09:01.165 --> 09:02.798
- That's a little hard
to believe.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.066

it's hard to believe

09:04.068 --> 09:05.768

in my bed too.

- Yeah, it is.

what this is all about,

09:08.806 --> 09:10.439

is with her,

and just back off?

was afraid of heights.

the dog poops.

No, no.

She might answer you.

26:23.106 --> 26:25.006
You never know.

26:30.479 --> 26:32.714
- If I'm bagging,
I should text Jake.

26:32.716 --> 26:36.117
Damn, my phone's dead.

26:36.119 --> 26:37.619
Can I borrow yours?

26:37.621 --> 26:38.186
- Mine is too.

26:38.188 --> 26:41.322
The weak signal up here
is murder on our batteries.

26:42.191 --> 26:44.058
- Went to voicemail.

26:44.060 --> 26:46.361
- Did it ring first?
- Yes.

26:46.363 --> 26:46.995
- Then it's on.

26:46.997 --> 26:48.496
- What difference
does it make?

26:48.498 --> 26:50.098
She's not answering.

26:52.468 --> 26:53.501
- Can't find my charger.

26:53.503 --> 26:56.504
- I must have left mine
in the lodge.

26:56.506 --> 26:58.873
Should we go back?

26:58.875 --> 26:59.707
- No.

26:59.709 --> 27:00.441
It's fine.

27:00.443 --> 27:01.976
It's kind of nice being cut off

27:01.978 --> 27:04.746
from everyone,
everything,

27:04.748 --> 27:07.115
just the two of us.

27:10.052 --> 27:12.053
- We can talk later.

27:13.622 --> 27:16.557
This is a dream come true.

27:17.359 --> 27:18.459
- Don't be such a nightmare.

27:18.461 --> 27:19.294
I wouldn't be calling you

27:19.296 --> 27:20.528
unless I was
completely desperate.

27:20.530 --> 27:23.298
- You're very needy for such
a ball buster, you know that?

27:23.300 --> 27:25.366
- Listen, that psycho bitch
is on the loose,

27:25.368 --> 27:27.135
and I need to find
a missing person.

27:27.137 --> 27:28.469
Can you help me track them down

27:28.471 --> 27:29.437
through the GPS on their phone?

27:29.439 --> 27:31.606
- That's some serious crazy,
Sadita.

27:31.608 --> 27:33.541
You think I'm some
James Bond dude,

27:33.543 --> 27:34.909
drinking Martinis and stuff,

27:34.911 --> 27:36.244
with a Batmobile
and stuff?

27:36.246 --> 27:36.978
- Look, I am asking you

27:36.980 --> 27:38.846
to ask your Dad
for another favor.

27:38.848 --> 27:39.814
- Damn, <i>blanquita.</i>

27:39.816 --> 27:40.715
It's like you want to be

27:40.717 --> 27:41.783
a part of <i>mi familia</i> so bad.

27:41.785 --> 27:46.087
- Don't cops do stuff like this
all the time?

27:46.089 --> 27:47.055
- Send me the number.

27:47.057 --> 27:48.256
I'll talk to my Dad.

27:48.258 --> 27:50.325
But you owe me.

27:51.660 --> 27:54.429
- You know I admire you
and love you,

27:54.431 --> 27:55.530
and you are so kind,

27:55.532 --> 27:58.232
and I would love to have
a sister like you.

27:58.234 --> 28:00.702
- But you do have
a sister like me.

28:00.704 --> 28:01.402
- That's just it.

28:01.404 --> 28:04.472
You know you're not really
my sister, right?

28:04.474 --> 28:06.974
Biologically
or legally.

28:06.976 --> 28:07.575
- Yes, I know,

28:07.577 --> 28:10.945
but I also know
right from wrong.

28:12.715 --> 28:16.551
- Oh, it's way too cold
and windy to go out there.

28:16.553 --> 28:17.452
Let's go find Jenna and Luke.

28:17.454 --> 28:19.320
- No, Jenna said she wants to be
on her own today.

28:19.322 --> 28:22.056
We don't want to be
buzzkill helicopter parents.

28:22.058 --> 28:24.792
- My shining is really strong
in this altitude,

28:24.794 --> 28:27.662
and I am sensing Jenna
does not want her buzz killed.

28:27.664 --> 28:32.967
And that there is a wild animal
craving some me.

28:34.503 --> 28:38.773
Hey, Biggie, foraging
for some berries and nuts?

28:38.775 --> 28:40.575
- And honey, honey.

28:40.577 --> 28:41.876
I'm off at 4:00.

28:41.878 --> 28:44.445
Apres ski in the base lodge bar?

28:44.447 --> 28:46.647
- Apres, yes.

28:48.550 --> 28:49.717
[growls]

28:49.719 --> 28:50.551
- Oh, my God!

28:50.553 --> 28:52.186
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

28:52.188 --> 28:53.354
This is scare-ifying!

28:53.356 --> 28:55.123
But I think I finally got it.
- Okay.

28:55.125 --> 28:57.492
Now that you're strapped in,
you can try moving.

28:57.494 --> 28:58.793
Let's start with falling leaf.

28:58.795 --> 29:00.094
- No, I don't want to fall.

29:00.096 --> 29:01.362
- Then let's just hold a beat,

29:01.364 --> 29:03.831
and you can try
not moving on the board.

29:03.833 --> 29:05.566
- Sorry I'm such a spaztron.

29:05.568 --> 29:08.703
You can go do the black diamond
with Matty if you want.

29:08.705 --> 29:10.805
- You haven't been
that much of a spaz.

29:10.807 --> 29:11.739
- Yeah, I have.

29:11.741 --> 29:13.441
And I don't just mean today.

29:13.443 --> 29:14.942
I mean, like,
for months now,

29:14.944 --> 29:18.513
and I appreciate you
putting up with it.

29:18.515 --> 29:20.915
- Well, back at you.

29:20.917 --> 29:24.051
Those weren't exactly
my finest hours either.

29:24.053 --> 29:26.487
I'm glad we're still friends.
- So glad.

29:26.489 --> 29:28.256
We only have
one more semester together,

29:28.258 --> 29:29.657
and I keep having these
flash-forwards

29:29.659 --> 29:32.360
to the flashbacks I'll have of
high school when I'm in college,

29:32.362 --> 29:36.664
and I want them to be
magical moments with my PPFFs.

29:36.799 --> 29:39.534
"Perma-posse
of friends forever."

29:41.236 --> 29:42.236
- All right.
- Okay.

29:42.238 --> 29:43.204
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

29:43.206 --> 29:45.206
- You sure?
- No.

29:45.208 --> 29:47.275
[beeping sound]

29:47.277 --> 29:48.743
- I think I see the house.

29:48.745 --> 29:49.710
- You be careful, Sadita.

29:49.712 --> 29:50.945
I need your help on the truck.

29:50.947 --> 29:53.748
You know, the wieners like it
when you hold them.

29:53.750 --> 29:54.649
- Yeah, that's clever.

29:54.651 --> 29:57.051
Thank you, and I'll let you know
how it goes.

29:57.053 --> 29:58.553
- Let me know when you're safe,
okay?

29:58.555 --> 29:59.720
You think you're
this tough bitch,

29:59.722 --> 30:02.156
but I know you're
a fragile little princess.

30:02.158 --> 30:04.125
- Go [bleep] yourself.

30:05.227 --> 30:07.028
- This is
a really nice neighborhood.

30:07.030 --> 30:07.795
What are they doing here?

30:07.797 --> 30:09.397
- Well, she's a
psychotic grifter.

30:09.399 --> 30:10.398
Use your imagination.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.066
- I'm just scared.

30:12.068 --> 30:13.034
- Don't worry.

30:13.036 --> 30:13.835
If she pulls a gun,

30:13.837 --> 30:14.702
I'll use you as my human shield,

30:14.704 --> 30:16.737
and you'll die a quick
and painless death.

30:16.739 --> 30:18.306
- Are you ever not
a total bitch?

30:18.308 --> 30:20.508
- Only to people
who don't repulse me.

30:20.510 --> 30:21.476
- Good.
Go by yourself.

30:21.478 --> 30:23.110
- Wait!
Don't go.

30:26.281 --> 30:27.882
- Why?

30:27.884 --> 30:29.884
- Because.

30:32.821 --> 30:37.391
I would feel better
if you were here.

30:37.860 --> 30:40.495
- Well, Sadie, if that's you
begging me to come with you,

30:40.497 --> 30:42.263
then I guess I have to
come with you.

30:42.265 --> 30:42.964
- That is not begging.

30:42.966 --> 30:44.565
Anyway, I have mace
in my pocket

30:44.567 --> 30:47.101
in case the nut job
tries anything.

30:47.103 --> 30:50.505
[doorbell rings]

30:51.907 --> 30:52.974
- What are you guys doing here?

30:52.976 --> 30:54.509
- Blowing that bitch's cover.

30:54.511 --> 30:56.544
Eva's real name isn't even Eva.

30:56.546 --> 30:58.346
It's Amber Horn
from San Pedro.

30:58.348 --> 31:00.381
She stabbed a guy in the face
with a pencil.

31:00.383 --> 31:03.117
- Excuse me, Hamilcrap,
that is my intel.

31:03.119 --> 31:06.220
- Whoa, whoa, you guys,
just stop it.

31:06.222 --> 31:08.656
I know you have a thing
against Eva,

31:08.658 --> 31:09.524
but you need to deal.

31:09.526 --> 31:11.092
- Do you even know
who she really is?

31:11.094 --> 31:12.527
- Yeah, I do;
She told me.

31:12.529 --> 31:15.429
But she is my girlfriend, and--

31:15.431 --> 31:15.963
- and what?

31:15.965 --> 31:18.533
- And it is really
none of your business.

31:20.769 --> 31:22.537
- I'm pregnant.

31:28.310 --> 31:28.976
- Obviously Matty and I

31:28.978 --> 31:30.344
still have a lot
we need to talk about,

31:30.346 --> 31:31.679
so do you mind leaving us alone?

31:31.681 --> 31:34.148
- I do mind, Amber.

31:34.750 --> 31:37.285
I call bull[bleep]
on this pregnancy.

31:37.287 --> 31:38.185
Pregnant with what?

31:38.187 --> 31:39.453
You've lied about everything

31:39.455 --> 31:41.556
since the day you got to PHHS.

31:41.558 --> 31:42.957
- Matty, I can't take this.

31:42.959 --> 31:45.693
- Listen, you guys,
you need to go.

31:46.828 --> 31:50.164
- Yeah, you try
getting us a cab.

31:50.566 --> 31:53.568
- So there's a lot more, Matty,
that you don't know,

31:53.570 --> 31:55.503
and I'm sure they're dying
to tell you,

31:55.505 --> 31:57.772
so I'd rather you hear it
from me first.

31:57.774 --> 31:59.340
- This should be interesting.

31:59.342 --> 32:00.107
- I don't live in P.V.

32:00.109 --> 32:01.909
I live in San Pedro
with my grandmother

32:01.911 --> 32:05.313
because my parents abandoned me
when I was seven.

32:05.981 --> 32:06.614
- I'm sorry.

32:06.616 --> 32:07.615
- Matty, you know
you have to take

32:07.617 --> 32:09.216
everything she says
with a major grain of salt.

32:09.218 --> 32:11.018
- I just really wanted to go
to a good school

32:11.020 --> 32:13.120
and belong somewhere
with people like you guys.

32:13.122 --> 32:15.156
You seem like
such a tight-knit group.

32:15.158 --> 32:17.825
- Actually, Jenna and I
hate each other.

32:17.960 --> 32:20.127
- I just wanted a chance
at a better life.

32:20.129 --> 32:23.497
- Matty, can I show you pictures
of Amber's bedroom?

32:23.499 --> 32:24.198
- [sighs]

32:24.200 --> 32:26.734
You must be
so proud of yourself, Sadie.

32:26.736 --> 32:28.569
It wasn't enough
you attacked me on the bus.

32:28.571 --> 32:30.338
You take advantage
of my grandmother,

32:30.340 --> 32:31.539
an old woman who's, like,

32:31.541 --> 32:32.573
the only person
in my family

32:32.575 --> 32:33.908
that gives a crap
about me?

32:33.910 --> 32:35.977
So you snoop through my bedroom?

32:35.979 --> 32:36.911
Good job.

32:36.913 --> 32:38.613
- You're nuts.

32:38.615 --> 32:39.113
- [scoffs]

32:39.115 --> 32:41.115
I've been attacked
by girls like you

32:41.117 --> 32:41.682
my whole life,

32:41.684 --> 32:43.451
and the kid I "attacked"
in the fourth grade,

32:43.453 --> 32:44.986
she was with two other kids
in the bathroom,

32:44.988 --> 32:48.155
holding me down, trying to dunk
my head into a toilet,

32:48.157 --> 32:49.123
talking about how trash I was.

32:49.125 --> 32:53.327
So, yeah, lucky for me,
there was a pencil on the floor.

32:53.329 --> 32:54.128
- [scoffs]

32:54.130 --> 32:55.162
- And there's more, Matty,

32:55.164 --> 32:56.464
and if you give me a chance,

32:56.466 --> 32:58.499
I'll explain to you anything
you want to know.

32:58.501 --> 33:01.102
But there's one thing
I never lied about

33:01.104 --> 33:01.936
that I would never,

33:01.938 --> 33:04.138
and those are
my feelings for you.

33:04.140 --> 33:05.206
They're sacred.

33:05.208 --> 33:07.174
- The sociopathic slag is good.

33:07.176 --> 33:09.410
Got to hand her that.

33:11.880 --> 33:12.613
- Hoo!

33:12.615 --> 33:14.949
Crazy powder day, huh?

33:14.951 --> 33:16.250
- Hi.

33:16.252 --> 33:18.252
Sorry, do I know you?

33:18.254 --> 33:20.554
- Yeah, Val, it's Will.

33:21.423 --> 33:22.390
Biggie.

33:22.392 --> 33:24.025
- Oh.

33:24.027 --> 33:24.525
Oh.

33:24.527 --> 33:26.794
Sorry, I didn't recognize you

33:26.796 --> 33:28.863
without your--
you know, your head on.

33:28.865 --> 33:29.830
- [laughs]

33:29.832 --> 33:31.032
Yeah, here I am.

33:31.034 --> 33:32.199
- Yeah.

33:32.201 --> 33:35.269
It's a whole new Biggie, huh?

33:35.871 --> 33:38.372
Just no fur.

33:41.910 --> 33:43.878
- Oh, God, there he is.

33:56.224 --> 33:56.957
Are you crazy?

33:56.959 --> 33:58.492
You could have died out there.

33:58.494 --> 33:59.860
Then what would I have done?

33:59.862 --> 34:01.262
- I didn't almost die.

34:01.264 --> 34:02.329
It's just a sprain.

34:02.331 --> 34:05.700
- Maybe you should
take it down a notch, gramps.

34:05.702 --> 34:07.001
- Yeah, thanks, Lace.

34:07.003 --> 34:08.469
[groans]

34:08.471 --> 34:10.504
Maybe I am feeling
a little old.

34:10.506 --> 34:13.074
Being around all these
high school kids,

34:13.076 --> 34:15.876
my little girl
about to leave the house.

34:15.878 --> 34:18.279
- Honey, don't feel old.

34:18.281 --> 34:19.780
That makes me feel old.

34:19.782 --> 34:22.750
[laughs]

34:22.752 --> 34:23.851
- Would you like another drink,

34:23.853 --> 34:27.154
or would you like to
head back to my den?

34:27.156 --> 34:28.422
[growls]

34:28.424 --> 34:29.557
- Uh, actually, Biggie,

34:29.559 --> 34:32.359
I don't know why I didn't
sense this sooner.

34:32.361 --> 34:35.229
Guess my shining
isn't infallible.

34:35.231 --> 34:35.796
- Your shining?

34:35.798 --> 34:37.498
- My extreme acuity,
my sixth sense,

34:37.500 --> 34:38.966
it can sometimes be a burden.

34:38.968 --> 34:41.035
But, anyway, you seem like
a nice guy.

34:41.037 --> 34:43.637
I just--I think I was so dazzled
by the costume,

34:43.639 --> 34:46.474
that I didn't even think about
what you looked like without it.

34:46.476 --> 34:47.641
- Oh, I'm not allowed
to take off

34:47.643 --> 34:49.643
any part of the costume
while I'm on duty.

34:49.645 --> 34:52.346
You know, because a bear body
and a human head,

34:52.348 --> 34:54.315
it would just
destroy the illusion.

34:54.317 --> 34:55.349
- Of course.

34:55.351 --> 34:55.850
Of course.

34:55.852 --> 34:58.586
I think I'm just
a little more attracted

34:58.588 --> 35:01.655
to the bear than the man.

35:01.790 --> 35:04.058
I don't know
what that says about me.

35:04.060 --> 35:06.060
Maybe I should get a dog.

35:06.561 --> 35:08.062
- It's cool.

35:08.363 --> 35:13.334
Your shining thing
kind of creeped me out anyway.

35:13.969 --> 35:15.369
- Well...

35:15.504 --> 35:18.739
Thanks for the walk
on the wild side, though.

35:22.844 --> 35:25.312
- I can't believe Matty
blew me off,

35:25.314 --> 35:26.413
and on a powder day.

35:26.415 --> 35:27.381
- And where's Jenna?

35:27.383 --> 35:29.416
I'm starting to get
a little worried.

35:29.418 --> 35:31.051
- I don't know.

35:31.053 --> 35:31.752
- Have you seen Jenna?

35:31.754 --> 35:34.088
- We haven't from heard from her
or Matty all day.

35:34.090 --> 35:36.724
- Luckily, I have my gift
of the shining.

35:36.726 --> 35:38.626
If I can just concentrate,

35:38.628 --> 35:41.896
it will guide them to me.

35:41.898 --> 35:42.963
Oh, my God,
my shining is so strong,

35:42.965 --> 35:45.533
it's sucking the energy
out of all the lights.

35:45.535 --> 35:46.400
- [screams]

35:46.402 --> 35:47.234
This is a sign from God.

35:47.236 --> 35:50.304
- Lissa, dearest,
you haven't done anything wrong.

35:50.306 --> 35:53.207
- But I've thought of
doing something wrong.

35:53.209 --> 35:54.308
- You have?

35:54.310 --> 35:55.509
- Yes.

35:55.511 --> 35:57.478
All the time.

35:57.480 --> 35:59.780
Isn't that just as bad?

36:04.052 --> 36:05.753
Hell feels really good.

36:05.755 --> 36:08.589
- Huh, well,
this just keeps getting cozier.

36:08.591 --> 36:11.725
- I'll look for candles
and flashlights.

36:11.727 --> 36:13.561
- I'll come with you.

36:15.330 --> 36:18.132
You have to know that I wouldn't
be here with Sadie

36:18.134 --> 36:21.202
if I wasn't really concerned
about you with her.

36:21.204 --> 36:22.870
- Well, I can take care
of myself.

36:22.872 --> 36:23.838
- Would you please listen to me?

36:23.840 --> 36:25.739
I have given up a lot
to be here.

36:25.741 --> 36:27.308
Luke pretty much dumped me.

36:27.310 --> 36:28.242
- She's pregnant, Jenna.

36:28.244 --> 36:29.410
You heard that part, right?

36:29.412 --> 36:30.411
- And you believe her?

36:30.413 --> 36:31.111
- At the moment, yes.

36:31.113 --> 36:33.147
I think I have to
take her word for it.

36:33.149 --> 36:35.916
- She just admitted to being
a compulsive liar.

36:35.918 --> 36:36.884
Has she even taken a test?

36:36.886 --> 36:38.052
I mean, I thought
I was pregnant once.

36:38.054 --> 36:42.223
- Yeah, and you were so upfront
and honest about it at the time.

36:44.025 --> 36:45.059
- How far along are you?

36:45.061 --> 36:45.993
- Don't know yet.

36:45.995 --> 36:46.861
I only skipped one period.

36:46.863 --> 36:48.329
- Why didn't you use protection?

36:48.331 --> 36:49.964
- I know.
It's crazy.

36:49.966 --> 36:50.731
We use condoms every time.

36:50.733 --> 36:53.801
It's like the universe
just wanted us to have a baby.

36:53.803 --> 36:55.102
- Yeah, right.

36:55.104 --> 36:57.204
That's what the universe wants.

36:57.206 --> 36:57.905
- Got 'em.

36:57.907 --> 37:02.376
Look, let's not get into any
more of this [bleep], all right?

37:03.712 --> 37:05.012
Truce?

37:05.580 --> 37:06.680
- I just want you to be okay.

37:06.682 --> 37:09.683
- If she's really having my kid,
I got to deal with it.

37:09.685 --> 37:12.820
I'm not putting my kid up
for adoption.

37:12.822 --> 37:14.355
- I know.

37:14.357 --> 37:15.756
- All right.

37:18.460 --> 37:19.526
[door creaks open]

37:19.528 --> 37:21.629
[woman gasps]

37:21.631 --> 37:23.130
- Who's there?

37:25.166 --> 37:26.934
- Hey, it's Eva Mansfield.

37:26.936 --> 37:27.601
- Who the hell are you?

37:27.603 --> 37:30.604
- This isn't
the Schafers' place?

37:30.606 --> 37:31.972
Do you know my friends
Carol and Bill?

37:31.974 --> 37:34.375
- We bought this house from them
five years ago.

37:34.377 --> 37:36.176
- Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

37:36.178 --> 37:36.844
I didn't know.

37:36.846 --> 37:38.779
You had a key out
right where they kept theirs.

37:38.781 --> 37:40.748
- Would you and your friends
please leave

37:40.750 --> 37:42.416
before I call the police?

37:48.123 --> 37:50.424
Somehow, Eva talked the owners
of that house

37:50.426 --> 37:51.191
out of calling the police.

37:51.193 --> 37:53.594
Somehow, Matty's faith in Eva
seemed unwavering,

37:53.596 --> 37:57.064
and somehow, I made it back
to the lodge and my bed.

37:57.066 --> 37:57.798
It was a very far cry

37:57.800 --> 38:00.634
from the romantic night
with Luke I'd been planning.

38:00.636 --> 38:01.502
[Sadie snores]

38:01.504 --> 38:02.703
The storm had passed,

38:02.705 --> 38:04.371
but that didn't mean
the air was clear.

38:04.373 --> 38:06.240
- Sadie, what are you
doing here?

38:06.242 --> 38:08.575
- I've been here the whole time.

38:08.577 --> 38:09.376
- Really?

38:09.378 --> 38:11.111
- Wow, that's spooky.

38:11.713 --> 38:12.646
My shining is telling me

38:12.648 --> 38:15.616
we need to get the hell
off this mountain.

38:20.789 --> 38:23.257
- Our last senior ski trip.

38:23.259 --> 38:26.460
- Well, we all have to
grow up some time.

38:26.462 --> 38:28.128
- Thanks, Jenna.

38:28.130 --> 38:29.830
- It was so scary last night.

38:29.832 --> 38:31.732
I kept wishing
I had someone to hold me,

38:31.734 --> 38:36.070
because I was all alone,
by myself, alone.

38:38.340 --> 38:40.407
- I didn't know
why Eva's getting busted

38:40.409 --> 38:41.175
as a house crasher

38:41.177 --> 38:42.109
didn't send Matty running.

38:42.111 --> 38:43.844
Either he still
actually believed in her,

38:43.846 --> 38:46.747
or he was just trying
to do the right thing,

38:46.749 --> 38:48.015
which was very Matty

38:48.017 --> 38:50.084
and kind of heartbreaking
to watch.

38:50.086 --> 38:53.020
- You know, maybe you should
take another test to be sure.

38:53.022 --> 38:54.855
There can be false positives.

38:54.857 --> 38:55.689
- Okay.

38:55.691 --> 38:56.490
Yeah, I know.

38:56.492 --> 38:58.392
- I just want to be sure.

38:58.394 --> 38:59.159
- Of course.

38:59.161 --> 39:01.562
And I want you to be sure.

39:04.366 --> 39:06.834
- I really couldn't tell
what he was thinking,

39:06.836 --> 39:07.534
which was unsettling.

39:07.536 --> 39:10.637
But seeing Matty take control
of his situation

39:10.639 --> 39:12.873
made me realize
I had to find a way

39:12.875 --> 39:14.942
to take control of mine.

39:16.544 --> 39:17.544
Luke?

39:17.546 --> 39:19.013
- Hey.

39:19.015 --> 39:19.813
- Hey.

39:19.815 --> 39:20.881
I'm so sorry.

39:20.883 --> 39:21.548
I really screwed up.

39:21.550 --> 39:22.783
I just got caught up
in all that Eva mess,

39:22.785 --> 39:25.886
and she's really bad news,
but I know that's no excuse.

39:25.888 --> 39:29.723
You dropped everything,
blew off work and school and--

39:29.725 --> 39:31.492
- Jenna, I get it.

39:31.494 --> 39:32.960
I really do.

39:32.962 --> 39:33.894
You're in high school.

39:33.896 --> 39:35.696
Everything's spinning
out of control,

39:35.698 --> 39:37.131
and you're just trying to cope,

39:37.133 --> 39:37.965
and, the truth is,

39:37.967 --> 39:40.134
you still have
a lot of growing up to do.

39:40.136 --> 39:46.173
And I think, for now, you should
probably just go do that.

39:46.175 --> 39:46.940
- What?

39:46.942 --> 39:48.042
Luke, no, no, no, no.

39:48.044 --> 39:48.675
It's--

39:48.677 --> 39:50.644
- you're a great girl, Jenna.

39:50.646 --> 39:53.881
I don't know,
maybe some day.

39:53.883 --> 39:56.283
But I just think
our timing's wrong.

40:10.665 --> 40:12.266
- You look like hell.

40:13.234 --> 40:15.602
- Luke just broke up with me.

40:16.237 --> 40:18.405
- I'm sorry.

40:19.741 --> 40:21.608
The psycho skitch
is in the bathroom,

40:21.610 --> 40:24.078
taking the test right now.

40:24.612 --> 40:25.913
It ends here, people.

40:25.915 --> 40:28.382
There is no way she is pregnant.
