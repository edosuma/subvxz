03:45.527 --> 03:46.537
Mao Sheng!

03:54.169 --> 03:55.070
Mao Sheng!

03:55.103 --> 03:56.838
Mao Sheng!

03:56.872 --> 03:58.173
Mao Sheng!

04:29.537 --> 04:33.709
Zhi Yu... Zhi Yu...

04:38.710 --> 04:42.310
Zhi Yu, there is a lady
who will come to see you.

04:42.711 --> 04:45.511
You better go get ready for yourself.

04:46.221 --> 04:48.292
I've told you that
I don't want English tutor.

04:48.693 --> 04:50.896
If looking for me,
tell her that you can't find me.

05:03.038 --> 05:04.172
Hi.

05:04.206 --> 05:05.107
Hi.

05:05.140 --> 05:07.541
Sorry, it's okay. It's okay.

05:10.812 --> 05:11.612
Oops.

05:15.250 --> 05:16.018
Sorry.

05:17.152 --> 05:18.619
My name is...

05:18.652 --> 05:21.089
Oh, it's okay. I speak English.

05:22.958 --> 05:24.058
- Hi.
- It's nice to meet you.

05:24.059 --> 05:25.626
Hi, nice to meet you.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.796
Come this way, please.

05:34.069 --> 05:36.471
Wow, you must be loaded.

05:36.505 --> 05:37.638
Excuse me?

05:38.440 --> 05:40.942
You have a lovely home.

05:40.976 --> 05:42.676
Well, I work very hard

05:42.711 --> 05:45.013
to make sure my son has the best.

05:45.047 --> 05:47.182
Can I ask you a question?

05:47.215 --> 05:48.183
Of course.

05:48.216 --> 05:52.254
Why is this job
a full-time live-in position?

05:52.287 --> 05:55.023
That's a lot of English studies.

05:55.057 --> 05:55.824
Thank you.

06:01.863 --> 06:03.098
Things have been difficult

06:03.131 --> 06:05.834
since my wife passed away last year.

06:05.867 --> 06:08.737
My son has also struggled.

06:08.770 --> 06:10.038
So in addition to tutoring

06:10.072 --> 06:13.041
I could use a little help at home.

06:13.075 --> 06:14.476
I understand.

06:14.509 --> 06:15.911
My condolences.

06:18.280 --> 06:19.181
Zhi Yu.

06:19.214 --> 06:22.818
Please come out and meet your new tutor.

06:26.521 --> 06:27.823
Hi, Zhi Yu.

06:27.856 --> 06:30.092
It's a pleasure to meet you.

06:30.125 --> 06:31.026
Hello,

06:31.059 --> 06:31.860
it's to me,

06:31.893 --> 06:33.762
pleasure for you meet.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.335
Zhi Yu, show some respect!

06:40.368 --> 06:41.470
It's okay.

06:41.503 --> 06:43.338
Just give him some time.

06:43.371 --> 06:44.372
My apologies.

06:44.406 --> 06:46.607
No need to apologize.

06:51.113 --> 06:52.581
So,

06:52.613 --> 06:53.915
what's the plan?

06:53.949 --> 06:55.750
I have a new job in Wanzhou

06:55.784 --> 06:57.084
and I need you to fly there with Zhi Yu,

06:57.085 --> 06:59.821
set up the house and
get him into his new school.

06:59.855 --> 07:01.957
As soon as I wrap up business here

07:01.990 --> 07:04.359
I will join you a few weeks later.

07:04.392 --> 07:06.328
When do you want me to start?

07:06.361 --> 07:07.162
Tomorrow.

07:07.195 --> 07:07.996
Tomorrow?

07:08.029 --> 07:08.797
Mhmm.

07:12.134 --> 07:13.268
Okay. Okay.

07:13.301 --> 07:14.102
Okay!

07:14.136 --> 07:15.403
Thank you.

08:26.341 --> 08:27.609
Duke.

08:29.110 --> 08:30.412
Hey, Mr. Chey.

08:30.445 --> 08:33.248
- How are you? How are you?
- Thank you.

08:35.650 --> 08:37.650
Good... good...

09:02.444 --> 09:03.411
Okay!

09:05.280 --> 09:06.448
Mr. Chey?

09:08.750 --> 09:10.151
One more thing.

09:17.459 --> 09:18.927
How much?

09:25.701 --> 09:27.369
A fairytale.

09:29.004 --> 09:30.939
There's been evidence, huh?

09:30.972 --> 09:34.909
In the caves right here in this region.

09:34.943 --> 09:36.746
Not just by your farmers,

09:36.778 --> 09:37.979
but by scientists.

09:44.486 --> 09:46.388
And we just found this.

09:51.326 --> 09:53.763
In a bear trap.

10:05.106 --> 10:06.174
No bear.

10:06.207 --> 10:09.844
No, it's like nothing
I've ever seen before.

10:17.319 --> 10:18.553
He wants...

10:18.586 --> 10:20.088
He wants one alive.

10:21.623 --> 10:23.591
Two million.

10:23.625 --> 10:25.260
Two million U.S.,

10:25.293 --> 10:26.827
U-S dollars!

10:27.329 --> 10:28.163
Yeah?

10:55.924 --> 10:57.592
Zhi Yu, some help?

11:21.883 --> 11:23.585
You ever been on a plane before?

11:23.618 --> 11:25.487
I fly one on FS ten.

11:25.520 --> 11:26.621
On what?

11:26.654 --> 11:28.490
Flight simulator.

11:28.523 --> 11:29.691
It's a computer game.

11:29.725 --> 11:30.625
Same thing.

11:30.658 --> 11:32.494
Not exactly.

11:45.540 --> 11:48.243
It must be destiny.

11:48.276 --> 11:49.043
Yeah.

11:50.011 --> 11:51.513
Joshua Ridley,

11:51.546 --> 11:53.615
energy consultant.

11:53.648 --> 11:55.583
I'm his business partner,

11:55.617 --> 11:56.551
Piao Zhimin.

11:57.485 --> 11:59.487
It's nice to meet you.

11:59.521 --> 12:00.688
I'm Denise Nichols

12:00.723 --> 12:02.424
and this is Zhi Yu.

12:02.457 --> 12:05.927
So what hotel are you guys staying at?

12:06.995 --> 12:09.899
Zhi Yu, get out your
English grammar book.

12:09.931 --> 12:11.132
No.

12:11.166 --> 12:14.502
Please get it out, chapter six.

12:14.536 --> 12:15.303
Thank you.

12:17.539 --> 12:18.373
Where?

12:19.474 --> 12:21.142
Chapter six, here.

13:26.341 --> 13:28.510
That's an interesting necklace.

13:28.543 --> 13:29.611
Where'd you get it?

13:29.644 --> 13:31.579
None of your business.

13:40.555 --> 13:42.090
It was my mother's.

13:42.123 --> 13:46.427
My friends tease me and say
that is a girl's necklace.

13:48.129 --> 13:50.565
They don't know anything.

13:51.699 --> 13:53.200
And I think

13:53.802 --> 13:55.270
it's very cool.

14:11.720 --> 14:14.522
Want to read the newspaper?

14:14.556 --> 14:15.690
Okay.

14:15.724 --> 14:16.491
Thank you.

14:21.997 --> 14:23.497
Hey, did you know that we're flying over

14:23.498 --> 14:26.869
one of the most mysterious
places in all of China?

14:26.902 --> 14:27.703
Mhmm.

14:30.706 --> 14:32.775
Where you see mystery,

14:32.808 --> 14:34.642
I see opportunity.

14:34.676 --> 14:35.978
Hey,

14:36.011 --> 14:40.448
the Yeren lives in Shennongjia,
under our plane.

14:40.481 --> 14:41.249
Wow.

14:44.552 --> 14:48.023
What kind of energy business are you in?

14:48.057 --> 14:50.658
Anything that burns, baby.

14:51.292 --> 14:53.627
Responsibly, of course.

14:54.795 --> 14:56.598
Those green mountains

14:56.631 --> 14:59.234
are home to some of
the rarest animals on Earth.

14:59.268 --> 15:01.736
You know, golden monkeys,
giant salamanders.

15:01.769 --> 15:05.339
How many jobs has a salamander created?

16:38.967 --> 16:40.668
Are you okay?

16:40.701 --> 16:41.303
Maybe.

16:41.336 --> 16:42.837
Put on your seat belt.

16:50.312 --> 16:53.648
Honey, I fly over 250,000 miles a year.

16:53.681 --> 16:55.384
Nothing to worry about.

16:58.753 --> 17:01.356
Is this something to worry about?

17:01.390 --> 17:02.925
What's wrong?

17:19.540 --> 17:23.444
Stop screaming, you're scaring him!

17:23.477 --> 17:24.980
Help!

17:25.012 --> 17:25.780
Help!

18:05.187 --> 18:06.221
Help! Help!

18:06.254 --> 18:08.023
We're gonna crash!

18:09.590 --> 18:10.858
We're gonna crash!

18:15.297 --> 18:16.431
Help, we're gonna crash!

18:16.465 --> 18:18.200
We're gonna crash!

18:18.233 --> 18:19.734
Help!

18:19.767 --> 18:21.203
Help!

18:21.236 --> 18:22.603
Help!

18:22.636 --> 18:25.273
We already crashed, you idiot!

18:25.307 --> 18:26.208
Zhi Yu!

18:26.241 --> 18:28.076
Zhi Yu's under this.

18:28.110 --> 18:29.311
He's under the seat.

18:29.344 --> 18:31.179
Let's get him up.
Piao Zhimin, help!

18:31.213 --> 18:33.081
Piao Zhimin, help us!

18:36.151 --> 18:37.185
Zhi Yu?

18:37.219 --> 18:38.186
Zhi Yu?

18:57.072 --> 18:58.240
Zhi Yu?

18:58.273 --> 18:59.607
Zhi Yu, talk to me.

18:59.640 --> 19:01.276
Can you hear me?

19:01.309 --> 19:02.944
Help!

19:02.978 --> 19:03.744
Help!

19:09.117 --> 19:10.618
You got him?

19:10.651 --> 19:13.821
Yeah, I got him.
You take care of the old man.

19:13.854 --> 19:16.058
Mister Feng, can I see?

19:24.832 --> 19:26.300
All right, listen.
You're gonna be fine.

19:26.301 --> 19:27.635
Okay? Just sit tight.

19:27.668 --> 19:29.603
You're totally safe now.

19:31.306 --> 19:32.673
Does anything else hurt?

19:32.706 --> 19:35.110
On your body? Does anything hurt?

19:36.011 --> 19:37.344
I think you're gonna be okay, okay?

19:37.345 --> 19:39.747
Let's get out of the plane.

19:41.249 --> 19:42.850
Hua, is flower.

19:43.818 --> 19:44.652
Fire?!

19:46.188 --> 19:47.289
Fire!

19:47.322 --> 19:48.924
Fire!

19:48.957 --> 19:49.723
Fire!

20:25.927 --> 20:27.628
We gotta get out of here!

20:47.349 --> 20:48.583
Where's Zhi Yu?

20:48.617 --> 20:49.451
He's fine.

20:49.484 --> 20:51.319
He's over by the...

20:51.353 --> 20:52.287
By the tree.

20:54.189 --> 20:55.290
What?

20:55.323 --> 20:56.158
Zhi Yu?

20:56.191 --> 20:58.093
Piao, where is he?

20:58.126 --> 20:59.094
Who?

20:59.127 --> 21:00.060
The kid! The kid! The
kid, like that tall!

21:00.061 --> 21:01.162
Girlie necklace! Where is he?

21:01.163 --> 21:02.964
Maybe he's in shock and wandered off.

21:02.998 --> 21:04.331
Don't go anywhere, I'll take care of it!

21:04.332 --> 21:07.002
He's my responsibility.
I need to go and find him!

21:07.035 --> 21:11.907
No, you don't. You need to
stay here and wait for the...

21:14.808 --> 21:17.078
It's gonna be fine.

21:17.112 --> 21:19.548
I'm gonna call the rescue copter.

21:19.581 --> 21:20.714
I have my phone.

21:20.748 --> 21:21.749
It's fine.

21:23.385 --> 21:25.353
And it has no signal.

21:26.354 --> 21:27.355
Great.

21:36.464 --> 21:37.232
Zhi Yu?

21:45.574 --> 21:49.177
Zhi Yu, if you can
hear me, make a noise!

21:52.247 --> 21:53.348
Mr. Feng?

21:55.749 --> 21:57.219
You're a little bit cut up,

21:57.252 --> 21:59.787
but nothing that looks really serious.

21:59.820 --> 22:02.390
You're probably gonna
need some stitches,

22:02.424 --> 22:03.625
but we can't do that here.

22:03.658 --> 22:06.261
So we're going to bandage
you up first, okay?

22:06.294 --> 22:07.062
Thank you.

22:07.095 --> 22:08.862
Piao, go get a first aid kit.

22:08.896 --> 22:11.333
Sit tight, I gotta see
if I can find the pilots.

22:11.366 --> 22:12.334
Okay?

22:34.522 --> 22:35.357
Zhi Yu?!

22:37.459 --> 22:38.727
Zhi Yu?!

24:48.990 --> 24:50.492
Is anybody there?

24:54.562 --> 24:55.597
Hello?

25:24.692 --> 25:25.527
Pilots?

25:30.098 --> 25:32.534
We have ELT. We'll be okay.

25:33.401 --> 25:35.370
You mean the emergency beacon, right?

25:35.403 --> 25:36.171
Yes.

25:39.641 --> 25:40.475
Zhi Yu!

25:43.913 --> 25:44.946
Zhi Yu!

25:46.514 --> 25:47.549
Zhi Yu!

25:52.420 --> 25:53.188
Zhi Yu!

26:13.608 --> 26:14.442
Zhi Yu!

26:27.522 --> 26:28.356
Denise!

27:44.866 --> 27:47.502
Oh, Zhi Yu! You're okay!

27:47.535 --> 27:48.570
Oh, God!

27:48.603 --> 27:51.105
You're okay, you're okay!

27:51.139 --> 27:53.508
What happened? How did you get here?

27:53.541 --> 27:54.575
- I was in the plane.
- Yeah.

27:54.576 --> 27:58.546
And then I woke up in this cave.

28:01.616 --> 28:02.584
Okay,

28:02.617 --> 28:03.718
we need to go.

28:24.138 --> 28:25.573
No, stay there.

28:31.046 --> 28:31.813
Damn it.

28:32.814 --> 28:35.383
Okay, we need to go this way.

28:38.786 --> 28:39.587
Okay.

28:40.622 --> 28:43.959
Okay, go. Okay, go.
Go, go! Go, go!

28:48.496 --> 28:49.330
Good.

29:00.909 --> 29:01.709
Go! Go!

29:01.743 --> 29:02.710
Go! Go!

30:25.994 --> 30:27.029
Don't look at him.

30:27.062 --> 30:28.496
Keep your eyes on the floor, okay?

30:28.529 --> 30:31.365
You understand me?
Keep your eyes on the floor.

31:11.974 --> 31:12.840
Joshua.

31:12.874 --> 31:14.910
Joshua, wake up.

32:23.678 --> 32:25.513
Zhi Yu! Where are you?

32:25.546 --> 32:28.016
Zhi Yu!

32:28.050 --> 32:29.117
Zhi Yu!

33:12.894 --> 33:14.428
Good day!

33:14.462 --> 33:16.131
Good day?

33:19.968 --> 33:21.802
Are you Mao Sheng?

33:23.005 --> 33:25.140
The Yeren hunter, eh?

33:27.943 --> 33:28.709
Yes.

33:32.180 --> 33:34.049
He thinks we're reporter.

33:34.082 --> 33:35.317
No, no, no, no.

33:35.350 --> 33:36.784
We're scientists.

33:36.817 --> 33:39.955
And we think you've made
a remarkable discovery.

33:43.992 --> 33:45.060
Yes! Yes! Yes!

33:45.961 --> 33:48.130
Please, sit down.

33:48.163 --> 33:48.931
Sit.

33:54.069 --> 33:57.171
Why are you doing here?

33:57.239 --> 34:00.909
We would like to hear about
your encounter with the Yeren.

34:12.054 --> 34:13.021
He says

34:13.054 --> 34:14.289
they only saw a bear

34:14.322 --> 34:15.991
with toothache.

34:16.024 --> 34:17.125
No, no, no.

34:17.159 --> 34:18.092
My father...

34:26.134 --> 34:27.936
It was the Yeren.

34:29.137 --> 34:30.871
Taller than Yao Ming.

34:33.141 --> 34:34.475
Lots of teeth.

34:36.011 --> 34:37.745
You, um...
Did you?

34:43.985 --> 34:46.088
Do you think you
would be able to show us

34:46.121 --> 34:48.255
where you last saw the Yeren?

34:59.234 --> 35:00.902
He wants us to leave.

35:00.936 --> 35:04.772
We will pay you, yeah?
For your trouble.

35:16.351 --> 35:18.886
He doesn't want our money.

35:21.156 --> 35:23.291
Sorry to disturb you then.

35:34.136 --> 35:35.103
That's it?

35:35.137 --> 35:36.737
You're giving up so easily?

35:36.771 --> 35:38.140
On the count of three.

35:38.173 --> 35:38.940
One, two...

35:40.042 --> 35:40.875
Hi!

35:42.210 --> 35:43.045
Three.

35:45.546 --> 35:47.382
Be at the river

35:47.416 --> 35:50.285
behind our house in the morning

35:50.318 --> 35:53.488
and I take you to find the Yeren.

36:03.932 --> 36:05.400
Let's make the fire really big

36:05.434 --> 36:10.305
because I want the rescue helicopters
to be able to see us.

36:10.338 --> 36:11.273
That's weird.

36:11.306 --> 36:13.375
These are known medicinals.

36:13.408 --> 36:15.177
And so we're assuming that

36:15.210 --> 36:17.012
the animal did this?

36:19.448 --> 36:21.049
He is not an animal.

36:21.083 --> 36:22.317
Okay, what is he?

36:22.350 --> 36:23.617
A human?

36:23.651 --> 36:27.389
Who can, like, come out
of the forest and help us?

36:27.422 --> 36:28.390
He is not a man.

36:42.037 --> 36:45.639
He says, some people
believe the Yeren is stupid,

36:45.673 --> 36:48.210
half-way between man and ape.

36:55.283 --> 36:56.551
Other people think

36:56.585 --> 36:58.153
they are very smart,

36:58.186 --> 37:00.355
the protector of the forest.

37:00.388 --> 37:02.591
I think he's very intelligent.

37:02.623 --> 37:04.625
I don't care if he's a Yeti,

37:04.658 --> 37:07.162
a Sasqautch or like a mutant hillbilly,

37:07.195 --> 37:11.166
we are the most intelligent
monkeys on the planet.

37:11.199 --> 37:12.733
That's what allowed us to conquer it.

37:12.766 --> 37:14.936
That's what allowed us to invent modern

37:14.970 --> 37:16.670
twenty-first century medicine.

37:16.704 --> 37:19.740
So lets take the twigs
and the dirt and the mud

37:19.773 --> 37:23.979
off the kid's leg and give
him some real medicine, okay?

37:24.012 --> 37:24.613
You're mean.

37:24.645 --> 37:25.447
Yes, I am mean!

37:25.480 --> 37:26.248
Stop.

37:27.182 --> 37:29.351
We're in a forest with a creature

37:29.384 --> 37:30.718
after a plane crash,

37:30.751 --> 37:33.054
so I apologize if I hurt your feelings.

37:33.088 --> 37:35.689
But let's put some
antibiotics on your leg

37:35.723 --> 37:38.026
so that it can get better, okay?

37:38.059 --> 37:38.960
Joshua?

37:38.994 --> 37:40.761
Calm down.

37:41.896 --> 37:44.366
Piao, get the first aid kit.

37:48.336 --> 37:49.171
Piao!

37:56.545 --> 37:58.812
Piao took the emergency kit.

37:58.846 --> 38:00.481
He took everything.
The food, the supplies.

38:00.482 --> 38:02.184
Everything is gone.

38:08.290 --> 38:10.358
That's ridiculous.
Why would he do that?

38:10.392 --> 38:12.427
I guess he saw an opportunity.

43:15.563 --> 43:16.397
Zhi Yu.

43:25.006 --> 43:26.674
You seriously don't
remember what happened

43:26.708 --> 43:28.076
last time you left the plane?

43:28.109 --> 43:29.711
You're memory is like that...

43:39.922 --> 43:40.889
Shoo!

43:40.923 --> 43:42.056
What are you doing?

43:47.795 --> 43:48.663
What?

43:48.696 --> 43:49.864
What are you doing?

43:49.898 --> 43:51.131
What do you mean, what am I doing?

43:51.132 --> 43:52.433
He's not hurting us.

43:52.467 --> 43:55.503
He's right. He wasn't hurting us.

43:57.405 --> 44:00.041
Oh well, well, I apologize then,

44:00.074 --> 44:03.611
for misunderstanding what
the nice monster wanted.

44:03.645 --> 44:04.546
Yes, no that's okay,

44:04.579 --> 44:07.715
don't thank me for
saving your life twice.

44:07.749 --> 44:10.652
Yep, bad Joshua always
coming in, saving the day...

45:17.719 --> 45:18.553
Hello.

45:19.887 --> 45:20.722
My friend.

45:22.190 --> 45:23.458
You are late.

45:24.392 --> 45:25.660
With the high altitude,

45:25.693 --> 45:27.395
it was a little bit
of a challenge, mate.

45:30.498 --> 45:31.699
Not for me.

45:31.733 --> 45:32.867
I'm okay.

45:32.901 --> 45:33.768
I am strong.

45:34.702 --> 45:35.737
I prove

45:36.604 --> 45:38.573
Yeren really exists.

45:38.606 --> 45:39.574
Oh, good.

45:39.607 --> 45:42.044
Well you can lead the
expedition then, yeah?

45:42.077 --> 45:43.711
You are in charge.

45:44.879 --> 45:46.714
Come on.

46:17.178 --> 46:20.448
There's a plane, there's a plane.

46:20.481 --> 46:21.616
Help!

46:21.649 --> 46:23.052
It's a plane! Hello!

46:23.085 --> 46:24.819
Hey, we're over here!

46:24.852 --> 46:25.820
Help!

46:26.754 --> 46:27.622
Help!

46:27.655 --> 46:28.756
Help!

46:28.790 --> 46:29.557
Help!

46:30.758 --> 46:32.061
We're down here!

46:32.094 --> 46:33.062
We're down here!

46:33.095 --> 46:33.861
Help!

46:33.895 --> 46:34.930
Help!

46:34.963 --> 46:35.897
Help!

46:35.931 --> 46:37.398
Help!

46:37.432 --> 46:38.198
I'm gonna go
put more wood on the fire.

46:38.199 --> 46:39.434
Stop!

46:39.467 --> 46:41.369
The fire is not gonna work.

46:41.402 --> 46:42.637
Feng is in bad shape.

46:42.670 --> 46:44.539
We need to get him to
a doctor right away.

46:44.572 --> 46:45.740
Exactly, he's in bad shape.

46:45.773 --> 46:47.976
He's in no shape to make
a big mountain hike.

46:48.010 --> 46:49.544
Then we will carry him.

46:49.577 --> 46:51.046
We will follow the stream until...

46:51.080 --> 46:52.480
Oh, that's a great idea!

46:52.513 --> 46:54.347
With a big monster waiting
out there to eat us.

46:54.348 --> 46:57.518
That's a chance we'll have to take.

46:57.552 --> 46:59.188
It says in every survival manual,

46:59.220 --> 47:01.322
"stay by the plane, stay by the plane,

47:01.355 --> 47:02.256
"stay by the plane!"

47:02.290 --> 47:03.758
It's like survival 101.

47:03.791 --> 47:06.861
Yet, you want to go wander off
into the wilderness.

47:06.894 --> 47:07.996
That's the plan?

47:08.030 --> 47:10.465
To risk everybody's life?

47:10.498 --> 47:13.768
That's exactly what we're going to do.

47:37.025 --> 47:37.792
crikey!

48:06.287 --> 48:07.488
Wow.

48:07.522 --> 48:09.958
You finally found your
albino salamander, huh?

49:09.117 --> 49:10.118
Come on, Mister Feng.

49:10.152 --> 49:12.087
Sit down, sit down.

49:17.692 --> 49:20.229
I think we should stop and rest.

49:20.262 --> 49:21.729
I'm tired too.

49:24.799 --> 49:26.034
Okay.

49:26.068 --> 49:27.035
Okay.

49:28.237 --> 49:30.838
We should build a shelter.

49:30.872 --> 49:33.075
It's definitely going
to get cold tonight.

49:33.108 --> 49:35.376
I'll go get some branches.

50:24.993 --> 50:25.826
Denise?

50:32.867 --> 50:34.136
What?

50:36.405 --> 50:37.705
That thing.

50:42.911 --> 50:43.744
I saw it.

50:45.180 --> 50:46.781
It's tracking us.

50:51.519 --> 50:53.487
It's protecting us.

51:36.031 --> 51:36.864
Look.

54:17.959 --> 54:18.792
Hello?

54:55.931 --> 54:58.433
We don't need witnesses.

54:58.466 --> 55:01.303
Don't worry, I'll handle this.

55:04.639 --> 55:06.208
Zhi Yu!

55:07.275 --> 55:08.944
Zhi Yu, are you okay?

55:10.412 --> 55:12.314
The boar was chasing me,

55:12.347 --> 55:13.281
but he shot it.

55:13.315 --> 55:14.082
What?

55:16.651 --> 55:20.322
Oh my God,
are we happy to see you guys.

55:20.355 --> 55:22.424
You survived the plane crash, did you?

55:22.457 --> 55:23.325
Yes, we did.

55:23.358 --> 55:24.226
Is that alive?

55:24.259 --> 55:26.428
No, dead as a doorknob, mate.

55:26.461 --> 55:28.363
We have an elderly man with us

55:28.396 --> 55:30.532
who may have a punctured lung.

55:30.565 --> 55:32.200
Which one of you is the medic?

55:32.234 --> 55:35.170
Yeah, we've got a first aid kit.

55:35.203 --> 55:36.238
Chow?

55:41.742 --> 55:44.012
First aid kit?

55:44.045 --> 55:45.347
So,

55:45.380 --> 55:47.315
you guys aren't like

55:47.349 --> 55:49.451
the main rescue team then?

55:50.285 --> 55:51.086
Yeah, no.

55:51.119 --> 55:53.188
No, no, no, we're just researching

55:53.221 --> 55:56.524
rare animals up here in Shennongjia.

55:56.558 --> 55:58.193
Duke Darwin, mate.

55:59.394 --> 56:01.196
And this is my friend,

56:01.229 --> 56:03.497
Doctor Yong Sai.

56:04.232 --> 56:07.168
Joshua Ridley, energy
consultant, nice to meet you.

56:07.202 --> 56:11.072
This here is Denise, and this is Zhi Yu.

56:11.106 --> 56:14.009
We don't care where you
guys are from, what you do,

56:14.042 --> 56:18.580
we just want to get the
hell off this mountain.

56:18.613 --> 56:20.148
Anybody hungry?

56:32.127 --> 56:35.463
So how'd you survive the plane crash?

56:36.897 --> 56:39.434
We were over a meadow and
the pilots tried to land there,

56:39.467 --> 56:42.470
but they didn't make it.

56:42.504 --> 56:43.871
And we got lucky.

56:44.773 --> 56:46.308
Then we were attacked by a bear.

56:46.341 --> 56:48.376
But he was no match for the Yer...

56:48.410 --> 56:49.277
The yelling.

56:50.445 --> 56:53.881
We screamed and it scared the bear away.

56:56.318 --> 57:01.356
So what university did
you say you guys are with?

57:01.389 --> 57:03.558
Privately funded, love.

57:03.591 --> 57:05.293
Corporate gravy train.

57:05.327 --> 57:07.262
It's where the money is.

57:10.932 --> 57:13.234
I will take him some water.

57:13.268 --> 57:14.035
Okay.

57:15.370 --> 57:16.204
Cigar?

57:16.870 --> 57:19.174
Thanks, Duke.

57:19.207 --> 57:19.974
Cigar?

57:21.343 --> 57:22.344
I'd love one.

57:23.244 --> 57:26.481
I'm a bit of a connoisseur, actually.

57:28.383 --> 57:30.418
Only the best, mate.

57:35.390 --> 57:37.025
I'm gonna go

57:37.058 --> 57:39.427
calibrate some, uh...

57:39.461 --> 57:40.228
Equipment.

57:56.678 --> 57:58.613
How's the old man doing?

58:00.582 --> 58:01.882
He has a fever.

58:01.916 --> 58:03.651
He's a tough old coot.

58:03.685 --> 58:05.487
He'll be all right.

58:05.520 --> 58:08.256
Hey, it's Zhi Yu, isn't it?

58:08.289 --> 58:12.460
I want to talk to you about something.

58:12.494 --> 58:13.528
Come on, son.

58:14.929 --> 58:16.297
He'll be okay.

58:25.740 --> 58:27.675
Oh, thank you so much.

58:28.676 --> 58:29.644
Oh, I'm good.

58:29.677 --> 58:31.446
Thank you very much.

58:51.533 --> 58:53.034
Excuse me.

58:53.067 --> 58:56.604
I'm going to make sure the
equipment is calibrated.

58:56.638 --> 58:57.405
Okay.

58:59.541 --> 59:00.575
See you soon.

59:00.608 --> 59:01.609
See you.

59:01.643 --> 59:02.410
Okay.

59:03.678 --> 59:06.514
I'm going to tell you something,
laugh after I tell you.

59:06.548 --> 59:07.315
Okay.

59:07.348 --> 59:09.451
They're planning on killing us.

59:09.484 --> 59:10.285
Laugh.

59:13.021 --> 59:14.489
How do you know that?

59:14.522 --> 59:15.690
Because I speak Chinese.

59:15.723 --> 59:17.459
You what?

59:17.492 --> 59:18.426
Yeah,

59:18.460 --> 59:20.428
it's really useful in
business to not let on,

59:20.462 --> 59:23.631
and like, when people are
going to kill you secretly.

59:23.665 --> 59:24.566
Laugh again.

59:27.735 --> 59:29.504
You know how we're here

59:29.537 --> 59:31.873
to study and protect endangered species?

59:31.907 --> 59:33.775
You know, like that bear you saw, right?

59:33.808 --> 59:35.276
I guess so.

59:35.310 --> 59:36.443
I'm just wondering whether you've seen

59:36.444 --> 59:38.813
any other unusual creatures around here.

59:38.847 --> 59:39.949
Unusual?

59:39.981 --> 59:41.516
Yeah, like I'm thinking

59:41.549 --> 59:43.518
extremely rare, matey.

59:43.551 --> 59:44.719
Like uh...

59:44.752 --> 59:46.154
Maybe uh...

59:46.187 --> 59:48.022
Two and half meters tall,

59:49.757 --> 59:50.658
long red hair.

59:51.927 --> 59:54.362
Like a big ape on steroids.

59:57.131 --> 59:58.566
I'd remember.

01:00:01.536 --> 01:00:03.037
Level with me kid.

01:00:03.071 --> 01:00:04.471
You've seen the Yeren, haven't you?

01:00:04.472 --> 01:00:05.908
No.

01:00:05.941 --> 01:00:07.375
Only newspaper.

01:00:07.408 --> 01:00:11.246
You want that old man to
get medical attention or not?

01:00:17.285 --> 01:00:18.386
Okay.

01:00:18.419 --> 01:00:19.287
We saw one.

01:00:20.188 --> 01:00:21.924
He says he's the guardian of the forest.

01:00:21.957 --> 01:00:22.925
And is he close by?

01:00:22.958 --> 01:00:23.725
No.

01:00:24.626 --> 01:00:25.995
If you're lying to me kid!

01:00:30.431 --> 01:00:31.266
Tiger?

01:00:35.403 --> 01:00:37.973
He's been here all along, hasn't he?

01:00:38.007 --> 01:00:38.907
He's been following us.

01:00:38.908 --> 01:00:40.208
Following or chasing?

01:00:40.241 --> 01:00:42.110
Yeren is my friend.

01:00:43.344 --> 01:00:45.547
He's your friend, is he?

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:46.381
No!

01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:50.451
Not exactly.

01:01:31.459 --> 01:01:32.293
Come on!

01:01:43.504 --> 01:01:45.573
Easy, old man.

01:01:45.607 --> 01:01:46.841
You're in bad shape.

01:01:46.874 --> 01:01:49.844
Take your hand off the boy.

01:01:49.877 --> 01:01:51.245
I'm afraid I can't do that.

01:01:51.279 --> 01:01:53.548
Because if this creature
is the last Yeren on Earth,

01:01:53.581 --> 01:01:56.751
I'm gonna be the one to catch him.

01:01:59.854 --> 01:02:00.822
No!

01:02:02.724 --> 01:02:03.725
Come on!

01:02:03.758 --> 01:02:06.327
I've got other plans for you!

01:02:07.195 --> 01:02:08.596
Let go of me!

01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:09.597
Hey!

01:02:09.631 --> 01:02:11.599
You want the old man to live or die?

01:02:11.633 --> 01:02:13.301
Because as soon we get your Yeren,

01:02:13.334 --> 01:02:16.005
the sooner Feng gets
medical help. You got it?

01:02:16.038 --> 01:02:17.572
Because he is the fish, yeah?

01:02:17.605 --> 01:02:20.675
And you, my friend, are the bait!

01:02:24.278 --> 01:02:25.146
Hold this for a sec.

01:02:25.179 --> 01:02:26.147
Okay.

01:02:32.955 --> 01:02:33.721
Hey!

01:02:36.091 --> 01:02:37.458
Not so fast.

01:02:54.342 --> 01:02:57.112
You have no idea what
you're dealing with.

01:02:57.146 --> 01:02:57.913
Yeah?

01:02:58.813 --> 01:03:00.581
All I know is,

01:03:00.615 --> 01:03:03.518
we've got weapons and he doesn't.

01:03:11.626 --> 01:03:14.595
Come on! Move it, little man!

01:03:22.336 --> 01:03:25.873
You know, that's very touching.

01:03:25.908 --> 01:03:28.911
Come out, you bloody big baboon!

01:03:28.944 --> 01:03:30.678
You saved him once, didn't you?

01:03:30.712 --> 01:03:33.414
So why don't you give it a second go?!

01:03:36.118 --> 01:03:39.854
Come out, you bloody big gorilla!

01:03:55.837 --> 01:03:58.839
Yong Sai, I need backup!

01:03:59.942 --> 01:04:01.876
I'll be right back.

01:04:06.647 --> 01:04:07.815
I've got it.

01:04:09.817 --> 01:04:11.853
Got it at twelve o'clock.

01:04:11.886 --> 01:04:12.854
Chow!

01:04:12.887 --> 01:04:14.022
Flank left.

01:04:14.056 --> 01:04:14.822
Li Wei.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:45.954
Yeren?

01:04:51.526 --> 01:04:52.360
Yeren?

01:05:23.158 --> 01:05:24.392
Don't move!

01:05:24.425 --> 01:05:25.760
You're in danger.

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:02.090
No! I'm gonna take him alive!

01:07:13.868 --> 01:07:14.869
Feng!

01:07:14.903 --> 01:07:15.670
Over here.

01:07:31.987 --> 01:07:33.021
Yeren.

01:08:09.490 --> 01:08:10.524
No!

01:08:23.205 --> 01:08:24.038
Yeren!

01:08:25.941 --> 01:08:26.774
No!

01:08:29.944 --> 01:08:30.778
Yeren!

01:08:31.879 --> 01:08:32.712
Yeren!

01:10:22.524 --> 01:10:25.160
You've said your last good-byes.

01:10:25.193 --> 01:10:26.794
You're wasting time!

01:10:44.645 --> 01:10:47.882
We're gonna make history, Doctor Sai.

01:10:47.916 --> 01:10:52.053
More importantly, we're
going to be very rich!

01:10:54.089 --> 01:10:56.558
Let the Yeren go!
He never hurted you!

01:10:56.591 --> 01:10:58.360
Technically he did, kid.

01:10:58.393 --> 01:11:00.694
He gave my men a beating.

01:11:00.728 --> 01:11:03.131
Look, if you take him
out of his natural habitat,

01:11:03.165 --> 01:11:04.065
he could die.

01:11:04.099 --> 01:11:05.934
His immune system could be compromised.

01:11:05.967 --> 01:11:08.303
That's enough out of you.

01:11:11.805 --> 01:11:13.542
You know, I think that we might have had

01:11:13.575 --> 01:11:15.610
a little bit of a misunderstanding.

01:11:15.644 --> 01:11:17.179
As you know, I'm a businessman.

01:11:17.212 --> 01:11:20.448
I have a win-win proposition for you.

01:11:21.550 --> 01:11:22.384
Right-o.

01:11:24.419 --> 01:11:25.253
Okay.

01:11:30.959 --> 01:11:32.460
Professional opinion,

01:11:32.494 --> 01:11:35.729
but I think you guys are gonna
have a little bit of trouble

01:11:35.763 --> 01:11:37.232
selling this monster.

01:11:37.265 --> 01:11:39.733
Got it sorted, mate.

01:11:39.767 --> 01:11:41.403
Okay, what're you getting?

01:11:41.436 --> 01:11:42.304
Two million.

01:11:42.337 --> 01:11:44.606
Two million? Really?

01:11:44.639 --> 01:11:45.440
That's all.

01:11:45.473 --> 01:11:46.274
Smart ass.

01:11:46.308 --> 01:11:47.342
Well, listen.

01:11:47.375 --> 01:11:48.376
Actually.

01:11:48.410 --> 01:11:49.177
Wait!

01:11:49.843 --> 01:11:51.346
Let the man speak.

01:11:55.116 --> 01:11:57.352
I think I can get
you in the neighborhood

01:11:57.385 --> 01:11:59.487
of twenty million dollars.

01:12:01.289 --> 01:12:03.058
Well, how are going to do that, mate?

01:12:03.091 --> 01:12:06.661
I do land lease deals with
this casino owner in Macao.

01:12:06.695 --> 01:12:09.730
You know, his new casino
is going to have a zoo.

01:12:09.763 --> 01:12:11.933
Like an endangered species zoo.

01:12:11.967 --> 01:12:14.035
You're joking, right?

01:12:16.770 --> 01:12:18.240
You may be willing to risk your life

01:12:18.273 --> 01:12:20.909
for this oversized orangutan, I am not.

01:12:20.942 --> 01:12:22.676
He'll be in a zoo, he'll
be well taken care of.

01:12:22.677 --> 01:12:23.445
Joshua!

01:12:25.846 --> 01:12:27.449
You're pigs.

01:12:27.482 --> 01:12:28.316
All of you.

01:12:34.923 --> 01:12:35.889
I get ten percent.

01:12:35.924 --> 01:12:36.725
You get five.

01:12:36.757 --> 01:12:38.493
Seven and a half.

01:12:38.526 --> 01:12:39.294
Deal.

01:13:16.797 --> 01:13:17.831
Hold on!

01:13:19.768 --> 01:13:21.403
Hold it, just hold it a minute.

01:13:21.436 --> 01:13:23.305
Put it down.

01:13:23.338 --> 01:13:24.105
Mao Sheng!

01:13:33.148 --> 01:13:33.948
Mao Sheng!

01:13:47.861 --> 01:13:49.364
Are you okay?

01:13:49.397 --> 01:13:52.600
He wanted me to protect the Yeren,

01:13:52.634 --> 01:13:53.834
I failed him.

01:13:55.437 --> 01:13:56.604
Oh, sweetie.

01:13:58.506 --> 01:14:00.408
Look, you cannot give up,

01:14:01.543 --> 01:14:02.377
okay?

01:14:05.947 --> 01:14:07.816
Mao Sheng,

01:14:07.848 --> 01:14:10.585
why don't we go that way instead?

01:14:23.131 --> 01:14:24.898
Mate, you're analog.

01:14:24.933 --> 01:14:25.734
I'm a digital man.

01:14:25.767 --> 01:14:27.335
Here, watch me.

01:14:34.676 --> 01:14:36.811
We are going that way!

01:14:36.845 --> 01:14:38.613
That way is dangerous.
We could get lost.

01:14:38.646 --> 01:14:39.880
Whatever!

01:14:39.914 --> 01:14:40.881
Let's go!

01:14:41.683 --> 01:14:42.517
Come on!

01:16:26.421 --> 01:16:27.355
Hurry up!

01:16:45.908 --> 01:16:47.542
I hurt my feet.

01:17:13.301 --> 01:17:15.938
The kid's got ten seconds
to decide his own fate!

01:17:15.971 --> 01:17:18.139
Duke, calm down.

01:17:18.172 --> 01:17:19.909
Let's all calm down.

01:17:31.219 --> 01:17:32.820
We're at the peak.

01:17:32.854 --> 01:17:34.822
The SAT phone might work.

01:17:39.127 --> 01:17:42.263
I'll make the call, we do the deal.

01:17:43.665 --> 01:17:45.466
All righty, then.

01:17:47.569 --> 01:17:48.636
Okay.

01:17:48.670 --> 01:17:49.771
Okay.

01:17:49.804 --> 01:17:50.772
Li Wei,

01:17:51.673 --> 01:17:54.108
prepare the shot tranquilizer!

01:18:02.083 --> 01:18:03.518
Are you okay?

01:18:05.653 --> 01:18:06.821
Give it try.

01:18:44.759 --> 01:18:45.860
Josh!

01:18:45.893 --> 01:18:46.861
Josh.

01:18:46.894 --> 01:18:48.830
Just one little problem.

01:18:51.766 --> 01:18:54.069
Yong Sai disabled the phone.

01:19:03.811 --> 01:19:05.847
Drop your weapons!

01:20:14.682 --> 01:20:15.683
Wait here.

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:18.786
Police.

01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:19.587
Okay.

01:20:21.090 --> 01:20:22.057
How bad is it?

01:20:22.091 --> 01:20:23.224
It's okay.

01:20:38.606 --> 01:20:39.440
Zhi Yu!

01:20:40.775 --> 01:20:41.809
Zhi Yu!

01:20:44.378 --> 01:20:45.914
Father! We're here!

01:20:45.948 --> 01:20:47.049
Zhi Yu, no!

01:20:47.082 --> 01:20:47.849
No! No!

01:20:49.151 --> 01:20:49.985
Go! Go!

01:20:51.153 --> 01:20:52.887
Father!

01:22:15.570 --> 01:22:18.840
I've got use for you now, kid. Eh?

01:22:21.843 --> 01:22:22.610
Help me!

01:22:26.014 --> 01:22:27.548
Father, help me!

01:22:31.886 --> 01:22:33.754
Father, help me!

01:22:33.788 --> 01:22:36.490
You play it safe old man
and put you little stick down.

01:22:36.524 --> 01:22:37.859
You want a hostage?

01:22:37.892 --> 01:22:38.726
Take me instead!

01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:40.695
I got your boy.

01:22:40.728 --> 01:22:42.097
You do as I say!

01:22:42.130 --> 01:22:43.131
Forget the boy.

01:22:43.165 --> 01:22:46.335
We can handle it, man to man!

01:22:53.175 --> 01:22:54.842
Nah.

01:22:54.876 --> 01:22:55.643
We do it my way.

01:22:55.676 --> 01:22:57.545
Tell the cops to back off!

01:22:57.578 --> 01:23:01.883
Nobody leaves the forest
until daybreak, you got that?

01:23:03.318 --> 01:23:04.152
Yeah.

01:23:05.954 --> 01:23:08.023
Just don't hurt boy.

01:24:00.142 --> 01:24:01.243
Are you okay?

01:24:01.276 --> 01:24:03.211
Yeah, I'm a tough guy.

01:24:32.174 --> 01:24:33.008
Yeren!

01:24:34.242 --> 01:24:35.310
Zhi Yu!

01:24:35.344 --> 01:24:37.079
Not again!

01:24:37.112 --> 01:24:38.546
Zhi Yu!

01:24:47.755 --> 01:24:48.589
Yeren!

01:25:15.183 --> 01:25:16.018
No!

01:25:17.885 --> 01:25:18.719
Yeren!

01:25:20.222 --> 01:25:21.555
No!

01:25:31.033 --> 01:25:34.102
Show a little bit of human kindness.

01:25:51.219 --> 01:25:53.554
You will never be one of us.

01:25:54.489 --> 01:25:56.124
You're an animal.

01:25:57.059 --> 01:25:58.060
You'll never

01:25:58.859 --> 01:26:00.795
understand the difference

01:26:00.828 --> 01:26:04.697
between revenge and justice.

01:26:06.902 --> 01:26:08.036
You beast!

01:26:44.106 --> 01:26:44.940
Yeren!

01:26:51.879 --> 01:26:52.713
Yeren!

01:27:46.767 --> 01:27:47.636
Zhi Yu!

01:27:57.012 --> 01:27:57.845
Yeren?
