00:01.067 --> 00:03.202
<i>- Previously on "Alias. "
- McKenas Cole.</i>

00:03.203 --> 00:06.536
Now he works with a third party.
Someone he calls "The Man. "

00:06.606 --> 00:08.540
How do I look?

00:08.541 --> 00:11.601
I need you to kill Arvin Sloane.

00:12.879 --> 00:15.080
No matter how protected
you think you are,

00:15.081 --> 00:16.749
you are not.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.517
Even from your friends.

00:18.518 --> 00:21.043
Even the one
you are about to see.

00:24.491 --> 00:26.859
A Covenant official
wants to defect.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.127
Leonid Lisenker.

00:28.128 --> 00:30.262
In exchange for his extraction
and immunity, he's willing

00:30.263 --> 00:32.664
to turn over everything
he knows about The Covenant.

00:32.665 --> 00:34.666
We'll find each other.

00:34.667 --> 00:37.167
We always find each other.

00:49.249 --> 00:51.450
Dixon, it's me.
I'm at the naval hospital.

00:51.451 --> 00:53.951
There's a sniper.
Lazarey's been shot!

00:57.424 --> 00:59.924
The matter's taken care of.

01:17.811 --> 01:20.311
Hand me the receiver.

01:30.290 --> 01:32.790
Check the power.

01:34.727 --> 01:37.227
Antenna.

01:51.811 --> 01:53.045
- Marshall?
- Go, Mountaineer.

01:53.046 --> 01:54.513
Camera's in position.

01:54.514 --> 01:56.849
Camera's online.
Signal strength is good.

01:56.850 --> 01:59.184
Testing infrared.

01:59.185 --> 02:01.915
Infrared's fine, Mountaineer.
You're good to go.

02:01.988 --> 02:04.488
Copy that.

02:06.192 --> 02:07.626
Are you ready?

02:07.627 --> 02:10.127
Let's do it.

02:25.745 --> 02:28.612
According to our
Covenant defector Mr. Lisenker,

02:28.681 --> 02:30.215
the chalet you were
sent to surveille

02:30.216 --> 02:32.050
is owned by one
of his former contacts,

02:32.051 --> 02:33.552
an arms dealer.

02:33.553 --> 02:35.587
Lisenker visited
the chalet a number of times

02:35.588 --> 02:36.622
on Covenant business.

02:36.623 --> 02:38.090
What The Covenant doesn't know

02:38.091 --> 02:40.125
is that when Lisenker
decided to defect,

02:40.126 --> 02:41.793
he hid a microdisk there.

02:41.794 --> 02:43.862
On it is a copy
of the Doleac Agenda.

02:43.863 --> 02:46.031
- The Doleac Agenda?
- The Covenant playbook.

02:46.032 --> 02:48.592
It details operational plans
for the six Covenant cells,

02:48.668 --> 02:50.402
including the names
and headquarters

02:50.403 --> 02:51.537
of the cell leaders.

02:51.538 --> 02:53.138
Obviously, if we
can identify and capture

02:53.139 --> 02:55.307
any of their leaders,
we can hobble The Covenant.

02:55.308 --> 02:57.902
In the best-case scenario,
shut them down completely.

02:57.977 --> 02:59.745
Can't Lisenker tell us
what's on the disk?

02:59.746 --> 03:01.146
Lisenker had neither the time

03:01.147 --> 03:02.881
nor the technology
to decrypt it.

03:02.882 --> 03:05.284
Have we identified a point
of entry for the chalet?

03:05.285 --> 03:08.083
Actually, based on
what I could pick up

03:08.154 --> 03:10.122
from the infrared cameras
you placed,

03:10.123 --> 03:11.523
perimeter defenses
are way too strong,

03:11.524 --> 03:13.492
so you can't go in
on the ground.

03:13.493 --> 03:15.694
And parachuting in,
that's not an option,

03:15.695 --> 03:16.962
because they've got
these turrets

03:16.963 --> 03:19.198
that would make that
not a very fun day.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.699
And those dots,
those are land mines.

03:21.734 --> 03:24.234
But what really makes
this security system unique

03:24.304 --> 03:26.205
is its lethal response system.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.574
You trip the alarm,
you buy the farm.

03:28.575 --> 03:29.908
The cameras showed you all that?

03:29.909 --> 03:31.510
Not directly, but they indicate

03:31.511 --> 03:33.745
we're most likely dealing
with the work of one person.

03:33.746 --> 03:34.947
Toni Cummings.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.548
She spent six years
in a U.K. Prison

03:36.549 --> 03:38.183
for breaking and entering.

03:38.184 --> 03:40.185
She turned her talents
from cracking security systems

03:40.186 --> 03:41.420
to designing them.

03:41.421 --> 03:42.888
According
to British intelligence,

03:42.889 --> 03:45.517
Cummings is paid up to
eight figures for her services.

03:45.592 --> 03:47.593
And if she designed
a system for the chalet,

03:47.594 --> 03:49.928
you can bet it contains
her signature deterrent.

03:49.929 --> 03:51.463
Lethal response.

03:51.464 --> 03:53.332
- Where is she?
- I'm already on that.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.467
She goes to where the work is,
mostly doing jobs

03:55.468 --> 03:57.803
for Euro celebrities
and children of royalty.

03:57.804 --> 03:59.438
The kind of people
you want to drop-kick.

03:59.439 --> 04:00.606
Once we get a lock
on her location,

04:00.607 --> 04:03.405
you will infiltrate posing
as clients and obtain specs.

04:03.476 --> 04:04.910
In the meantime,
I'll go see Sloane,

04:04.911 --> 04:08.244
see if there's any fallout
after Lisenker's defection.

04:08.314 --> 04:10.082
Sydney, Vaughn,
be prepped to leave

04:10.083 --> 04:12.583
as soon as we find Cummings.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.498
Look, Omnifam
has enough medicine

04:26.499 --> 04:28.267
to treat the malaria epidemic

04:28.268 --> 04:30.669
in the entire Nasarawa region.

04:30.670 --> 04:33.170
Well, then I suggest
that you reconsider my offer,

04:33.206 --> 04:35.731
because I cannot promise you it
will be on the table next week.

04:36.843 --> 04:39.368
Only the third-largest
non-governmental

04:39.445 --> 04:40.879
relief organization
in the world.

04:40.880 --> 04:42.581
One might think
that would make a difference.

04:42.582 --> 04:45.082
Hello, Jack.

04:45.451 --> 04:46.585
I wanted to speak with you

04:46.586 --> 04:48.353
regarding
the Lisenker defection.

04:48.354 --> 04:50.879
Any word on how The Covenant
is taking it?

04:50.957 --> 04:54.757
Tell me, Jack, is that
why you came to see me?

04:58.231 --> 05:00.731
About last week.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.895
It was a matter
of circumstance, Arvin.

05:04.704 --> 05:06.705
Whether I would have
gone through with it...

05:06.706 --> 05:08.707
Oh, you would have.

05:08.708 --> 05:10.475
I would have.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.010
Perhaps.

05:12.011 --> 05:13.945
And now you feel guilty.

05:13.946 --> 05:15.647
Well, don't bother, Jack.

05:15.648 --> 05:18.549
Sydney's life was at stake.

05:18.618 --> 05:21.086
How can I blame a man
for doing whatever he can

05:21.087 --> 05:23.587
to save his daughter's life?

05:26.059 --> 05:29.825
It occurred to me the other
night after you left...

05:31.397 --> 05:33.897
...just how lucky you are.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.501
What your life has become,

05:36.502 --> 05:39.198
how close
you and Sydney are now.

05:39.939 --> 05:42.439
And then I thought
about my wife.

05:45.945 --> 05:48.607
I miss Emily, Jack.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.885
The work I do here.

05:53.886 --> 05:56.386
The research.

05:56.456 --> 06:00.085
Feeding those who would
otherwise go hungry.

06:01.661 --> 06:06.030
I thought that somehow
it would bring me

06:06.099 --> 06:09.591
peace for all that came before.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.870
But there's nothing.

06:14.173 --> 06:16.903
Nothing can erase the past.

06:17.677 --> 06:21.773
Nothing can fill the void
of being alone.

06:23.282 --> 06:26.740
If that's how it seems,
there is something.

06:27.754 --> 06:30.917
The agency has someone
you can talk to in confidence,

06:30.990 --> 06:33.490
if you like.

06:33.526 --> 06:37.189
As someone who today has no
intention of ending your life,

06:37.263 --> 06:39.564
I can arrange a meeting.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.659
You have to stay focused, Arvin.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.736
Maintain your cover
as a double agent

06:44.737 --> 06:46.705
within The Covenant.

06:46.706 --> 06:49.206
You're right, Jack.
I do.

06:51.911 --> 06:55.870
But I don't think
that my condition

06:55.948 --> 07:00.476
can be helped by a psychiatrist.

07:04.323 --> 07:06.324
Now that I know
what happened to me

07:06.325 --> 07:08.160
over the last two years,

07:08.161 --> 07:10.061
in theory,
I should finally be able

07:10.062 --> 07:11.563
to move on with my life.

07:11.564 --> 07:14.064
In theory.

07:14.133 --> 07:17.728
The thing is, when I look ahead,
all I see is Vaughn.

07:17.804 --> 07:20.172
I understand
from reading your brief

07:20.173 --> 07:22.407
the two of you
were imprisoned in North Korea,

07:22.408 --> 07:24.908
almost killed.

07:25.044 --> 07:27.544
This might seem trivial.

07:30.016 --> 07:32.017
But he kissed me.

07:32.018 --> 07:34.953
We kissed.
I mean, I kissed him back.

07:35.021 --> 07:36.788
Is that distinction irrelevant?

07:36.789 --> 07:39.690
Is it irrelevant to you?

07:44.964 --> 07:47.464
That moment.

07:48.568 --> 07:51.799
What happened in North Korea
makes it difficult.

07:52.939 --> 07:56.568
And we're supposed to go
on another operation together.

07:57.276 --> 08:00.006
It's sort of hard to deal with.

08:01.481 --> 08:05.975
How would you feel if Vaughn
left his wife for you?

08:07.787 --> 08:10.287
I don't know.

08:11.290 --> 08:14.691
I don't think he would ever
get divorced because of me.

08:14.760 --> 08:18.287
I mean, I think it would be
because he and Lauren

08:18.364 --> 08:20.332
don't belong together.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.833
Does he belong with you?

08:32.111 --> 08:35.171
Have you ever felt that
someone's your soul mate?

08:43.188 --> 08:45.257
You're a good guy,
you don't want to hurt anybody,

08:45.258 --> 08:48.159
but you're guaranteed
you're gonna hurt everybody.

08:49.128 --> 08:50.762
What are you talking about?

08:50.763 --> 08:53.288
- I really don't know.
- That's helpful advice.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.900
If you think I'm gonna tell you

08:54.901 --> 08:56.101
to stay
in a loveless marriage...

08:56.102 --> 08:57.269
It's not a loveless marriage.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.004
Whatever. And if you're
waiting for me to tell you

08:59.005 --> 09:00.238
to leave your wife
for another woman,

09:00.239 --> 09:02.739
you can forget about that, too.

09:03.643 --> 09:05.210
Do you think you can be
in love with two people

09:05.211 --> 09:06.077
at the same time?

09:06.078 --> 09:08.578
No, I don't.

09:09.115 --> 09:11.283
However, I did have
the same intense feelings

09:11.284 --> 09:14.117
for both Sporty and Posh Spice.

09:14.520 --> 09:17.020
Yeah, who didn't?

09:21.894 --> 09:23.795
Come in.

09:23.796 --> 09:25.697
I found your size.

09:25.698 --> 09:27.732
Great.
Thank you.

09:27.733 --> 09:31.100
Do you have something similar
in black, maybe with some lace?

09:31.170 --> 09:33.670
Thanks.

09:37.076 --> 09:39.576
Come in.

09:44.717 --> 09:49.154
I must say, you're quite
an impressive actress.

09:49.622 --> 09:51.423
When I approached you
in the parking garage,

09:51.424 --> 09:52.891
even I didn't realize you and I

09:52.892 --> 09:55.827
were working
for the same organization.

09:57.396 --> 10:00.058
Would you like to put
something on?

10:00.833 --> 10:03.068
No, I'm rather comfortable
like this.

10:03.069 --> 10:04.836
Would you like me
to put something on?

10:04.837 --> 10:07.337
Hardly.

10:07.406 --> 10:10.375
You and I share
a similar predicament.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.177
The Covenant.

10:12.178 --> 10:14.179
We're expected
to carry out orders

10:14.180 --> 10:17.843
without knowing exactly
how or why we're doing so.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.851
Hence the death of my father.

10:22.421 --> 10:24.356
At your hand.

10:24.357 --> 10:26.358
You were given
and carried out orders

10:26.359 --> 10:27.792
without question.

10:27.793 --> 10:30.028
Not that my father
deserved to live.

10:30.029 --> 10:30.929
He didn't.

10:30.930 --> 10:33.865
It's just that I'm bankrolling
this entire operation

10:33.933 --> 10:36.301
while being treated like
a worthless foot soldier.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.169
Why are you coming to me
with this?

10:38.170 --> 10:40.405
Because since I've learned
of your true affiliation,

10:40.406 --> 10:42.741
I've studied up on you.

10:42.742 --> 10:44.776
Your history.

10:44.777 --> 10:47.012
Your skills.

10:47.013 --> 10:49.513
Your connections.

10:51.183 --> 10:53.518
I also like your perfume.

10:53.519 --> 10:55.220
What do you want?

10:55.221 --> 10:57.721
To stage a coup.

10:57.790 --> 10:59.591
I know of three cell leaders.

10:59.592 --> 11:02.092
I believe you know
the other three.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.895
I propose we eliminate them all.

11:10.469 --> 11:11.736
Look at this.

11:11.737 --> 11:14.706
It must be your lucky...
day.

11:14.774 --> 11:18.301
Actually, I believe
it's my lucky day.

11:24.617 --> 11:26.818
Once we eliminate
all six cell leaders,

11:26.819 --> 11:28.053
we'll travel to St. Petersburg

11:28.054 --> 11:29.954
to meet with the head
of Covenant operations.

11:29.955 --> 11:31.990
Why, to make it easier
for him to kill us?

11:31.991 --> 11:34.125
On the contrary.

11:34.126 --> 11:37.118
Each cell leader wears
a watch containing access keys

11:37.196 --> 11:39.130
to their respective
headquarters.

11:39.131 --> 11:41.366
Once we have all six keys,

11:41.367 --> 11:43.201
we'll force our ascension
within The Covenant,

11:43.202 --> 11:46.171
under threat
that if they don't comply,

11:46.238 --> 11:49.105
the keys will be handed
over to the CIA.

11:52.344 --> 11:55.745
Which color do you think
my husband would prefer?

11:58.250 --> 12:00.775
I prefer the black.

12:01.687 --> 12:04.187
Red it is.

12:37.556 --> 12:40.457
<i># Make up your mind #</i>

12:40.526 --> 12:43.518
<i># Take me or leave me #</i>

12:43.596 --> 12:46.690
<i># I've been doin' fine #</i>

12:46.766 --> 12:48.967
<i># With or without you #</i>

12:52.638 --> 12:53.738
Dad.

12:53.739 --> 12:57.004
I thought we might talk business
over dinner.

12:57.076 --> 13:00.477
<i># The truth is in your eyes #</i>

13:01.680 --> 13:02.881
We've got a lock on Cummings.

13:02.882 --> 13:05.283
She's operating out of
a high-end club in Athens.

13:05.284 --> 13:08.014
You're going in as South-African
diamond smugglers.

13:08.087 --> 13:09.154
You've heard of her work,

13:09.155 --> 13:11.256
want her to upgrade
your Cape Town facility.

13:11.257 --> 13:13.158
How about we just
tell her we're CIA

13:13.159 --> 13:14.626
and want to ask her
some questions?

13:14.627 --> 13:17.095
We believe Cummings
designed the security system.

13:17.096 --> 13:18.363
We're not 100%.

13:18.364 --> 13:20.924
We need to confirm her work
in Chamonix first,

13:21.000 --> 13:22.867
then persuade her
to detail the countermeasures

13:22.868 --> 13:24.369
she put in place at the chalet.

13:24.370 --> 13:25.703
They're prepping
the mission now.

13:25.704 --> 13:28.571
Dixon will be contacting you
within the hour.

13:30.242 --> 13:32.510
I expect Vaughn
will be going with you.

13:32.511 --> 13:35.036
Yeah, I figured.

13:36.348 --> 13:38.483
You realize
it is your prerogative

13:38.484 --> 13:40.118
to ask Dixon
to send someone else.

13:40.119 --> 13:43.316
If Dixon sends me
on an operation, I'm going.

13:43.389 --> 13:47.086
What I mean is,
someone instead of Vaughn.

13:52.898 --> 13:55.300
I'd be more
comfortable going with Weiss.

13:55.301 --> 13:57.929
The contacts, the ones
used to locate Cummings,

13:58.003 --> 13:59.404
Weiss cultivated them

13:59.405 --> 14:02.465
while working a Pan-African
smuggling operation.

14:06.111 --> 14:08.313
I'll call him in,
have him meet you in tac-ops.

14:08.314 --> 14:10.814
Thank you.

14:18.991 --> 14:25.191
The deficit must remain
below 3% of GNP.

14:25.264 --> 14:26.898
Yes, Robert.

14:26.899 --> 14:29.868
Well, of course.
You shall see the figures.

14:29.935 --> 14:31.603
You're on.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.071
Well, absolutely.

14:33.072 --> 14:35.768
No, there is now no question.

14:38.077 --> 14:42.537
Robert, would you mind terribly
if I call you later?

14:43.782 --> 14:46.184
Thank you.

14:46.185 --> 14:49.484
Mr. Gathird, Lauren Reed.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.589
We met before in London.

14:51.590 --> 14:54.650
Of course, Ms. Reed.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.494
What are you doing here?

14:56.495 --> 14:59.987
There is something I was hoping
we might be able to discuss.

15:00.065 --> 15:03.899
And only a man of your position
within The Covenant can help me.

15:03.969 --> 15:06.665
Still, there are protocols.

15:06.739 --> 15:10.402
You didn't worry about protocols
the last time we spoke.

15:13.245 --> 15:16.578
I'll meet you gentlemen
upstairs.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.654
Mr. Gathird.

15:22.655 --> 15:25.155
I need your counsel.

15:25.824 --> 15:28.816
The CIA's aware there's
a mole in their organization,

15:28.894 --> 15:33.422
and I'm feeling vulnerable.

15:34.733 --> 15:36.467
Why come to me?

15:36.468 --> 15:38.102
Well, you said
the last time we spoke

15:38.103 --> 15:40.603
that if I ever needed
anything...

15:41.740 --> 15:44.240
I need your help.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.180
Do you have a minute?

16:57.516 --> 17:00.679
You know,
you're unbelievably good.

17:05.290 --> 17:08.487
Come on. Our flight
to Paris leaves in an hour.

17:09.428 --> 17:10.728
Yes.

17:10.729 --> 17:13.229
Yes, it does.

17:28.113 --> 17:29.380
There she is.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.881
Can I help you?

17:32.184 --> 17:34.684
Tell Ms. Cummings
her clients are here.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.700
You are sweet, darling.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.904
Sit down.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.106
John Steadman.
This is Rebecca Davison.

17:55.107 --> 17:57.208
- Toni Cummings.
- A pleasure.

17:57.209 --> 17:59.444
I prefer not to shake hands.

17:59.445 --> 18:01.945
Sit down.

18:03.215 --> 18:05.911
You want to secure
a facility in Cape Town?

18:05.984 --> 18:07.919
Yes, a diamond-processing plant.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.487
We've had trouble
with break-ins.

18:09.488 --> 18:12.457
The political situation
there is unstable.

18:12.524 --> 18:13.991
They say we're
stripping their land

18:13.992 --> 18:16.327
of its natural resources,
but honestly,

18:16.328 --> 18:18.828
do you think God intended
this kind of beauty

18:18.897 --> 18:21.397
to be wasted in the ground?

18:22.067 --> 18:24.502
Whether we end up
working together or not,

18:24.503 --> 18:26.504
do me a favor, huh?

18:26.505 --> 18:28.573
Don't talk to me about God.

18:28.574 --> 18:30.641
What did God intend?

18:30.642 --> 18:32.743
Hell if I know.

18:32.744 --> 18:35.244
Not a clue.

18:35.414 --> 18:37.281
My work is good.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.449
Yes, we know.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.851
We're very interested

18:39.852 --> 18:42.980
in one of your lethal
response systems.

18:44.289 --> 18:47.747
What you're asking me to do
is illegal in most countries.

18:48.660 --> 18:51.356
So, Mr. Steadman.

18:51.930 --> 18:53.664
Give me one good reason

18:53.665 --> 18:56.725
why I would ever
risk my ass for you.

18:56.802 --> 19:00.067
I believe we can give you
2 million reasons.

19:08.847 --> 19:10.848
Well...

19:10.849 --> 19:13.349
looks like y'all
don't need an ATM.

19:16.522 --> 19:18.356
So, what did you kids
have in mind?

19:18.357 --> 19:22.521
Something like the system
you built in Chamonix.

19:23.862 --> 19:26.888
And how do two
South-African rock wranglers

19:26.965 --> 19:29.033
hear about Chamonix?

19:29.034 --> 19:31.534
The owner is a client.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.710
Yeah.

19:39.711 --> 19:41.746
I outdid myself on that one.

19:41.747 --> 19:45.012
But if you're interested
in a job like that,

19:45.083 --> 19:48.575
those stones won't even
cover the down payment.

19:48.654 --> 19:51.316
They barely cover
this conversation.

19:51.390 --> 19:53.984
Well, then I have
a counteroffer.

19:54.059 --> 19:56.559
Really?

20:02.367 --> 20:04.535
Show us the schematics
for what you built in Chamonix.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.337
Tell us how to bypass
the system.

20:06.338 --> 20:08.206
In exchange, we will make sure

20:08.207 --> 20:09.674
you're treated well
while in custody.

20:09.675 --> 20:11.509
You're smart enough
to know the CIA

20:11.510 --> 20:13.044
has big, wide, comfy cells

20:13.045 --> 20:15.673
with hot water,
cotton sheets, and TV.

20:15.747 --> 20:18.247
We also have cramped,
cold, little cells

20:18.250 --> 20:20.251
with a bare cot
and a hole in the floor.

20:20.252 --> 20:22.687
See, either way,
you're coming home with us.

20:22.688 --> 20:25.188
Where you live is up to you.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.197
There is no bypassing
the system.

20:32.264 --> 20:34.764
Okay, Cummings told you

20:34.866 --> 20:35.800
the chalet
is virtually impenetrable.

20:35.801 --> 20:38.269
They've got three tiers of
tree-mounted security cameras,

20:38.270 --> 20:40.898
plus there's military-trained
guards that patrol.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.373
We need to find some way in.

20:42.374 --> 20:44.408
The Doleac Agenda could mean
the end of The Covenant.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.744
I said virtually impenetrable.

20:46.745 --> 20:49.245
Now, the lethal response
system Toni Cummings built

20:49.281 --> 20:50.615
is in a half-mile-long tunnel,

20:50.616 --> 20:53.915
and that'll serve as our way
into the chalet.

20:54.553 --> 20:56.320
According to the schematic
she gave us,

20:56.321 --> 20:59.313
the lethal response system
is comprised of three zones.

20:59.391 --> 21:01.025
You've got your
automated sentry guns,

21:01.026 --> 21:02.793
electrified zone,
and the big finish...

21:02.794 --> 21:04.562
motion-triggered acid spray.

21:04.563 --> 21:05.730
So how do we get through?

21:05.731 --> 21:07.999
- Well, what I'm thinking...
- We.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.301
I'm sorry.
We.

21:10.302 --> 21:12.536
She was very helpful
in creating...

21:12.537 --> 21:15.370
In fact,
she's always very helpful.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.408
Inflatable Kevlar.

21:17.409 --> 21:19.543
Now, when you hit the first
tunnel, you toss it in.

21:19.544 --> 21:21.279
The guns will open fire,

21:21.280 --> 21:23.447
but the ball will keep
moving, which means the guns

21:23.448 --> 21:27.179
are gonna keep firing until
they're out of ammunition.

21:27.252 --> 21:28.953
Now you're
at the electrified zone.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.980
Cummings armed the tunnel
with 150,000 volts,

21:32.057 --> 21:33.924
which will be
a 15 on this meter.

21:33.925 --> 21:35.693
You want to
double-check it there.

21:35.694 --> 21:37.728
The Neoprene layer
you will be wearing

21:37.729 --> 21:40.391
will protect you,
even if this clocks in at 25.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.867
- And the acid bath?
- We're working on that.

21:42.868 --> 21:44.235
And we need to figure out a way

21:44.236 --> 21:45.936
to get around
the alarm diagnostics.

21:45.937 --> 21:47.638
- Right.
- Ow!

21:47.639 --> 21:49.507
- What?
- God.

21:49.508 --> 21:51.108
- I'm sorry. The baby's kicking.
- Really?

21:51.109 --> 21:55.569
He or she is usually pretty
inactive at this time.

21:55.647 --> 21:58.309
You keep track
of when the baby kicks?

21:58.383 --> 21:59.784
- Carrie, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

21:59.785 --> 22:00.985
The baby's kicking.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.486
I'm good.

22:46.598 --> 22:48.099
Hello?

22:48.100 --> 22:50.368
Jack, it's Arvin.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.099
When you suggested
I see a therapist...

22:54.639 --> 22:57.139
...perhaps you were right.

23:17.596 --> 23:19.630
I'm supposed to say
something important?

23:19.631 --> 23:22.131
You can say anything.

23:23.835 --> 23:25.970
You're far more attractive
than I imagined.

23:25.971 --> 23:27.371
What did you imagine?

23:27.372 --> 23:28.873
I checked up on you.

23:28.874 --> 23:32.435
Yale, Columbia,

23:32.511 --> 23:36.641
prestigious internship
at Mass General.

23:36.715 --> 23:38.816
And then you end up as a GS-18

23:38.817 --> 23:41.650
buried in some cubicle
at Langley.

23:42.654 --> 23:44.855
Well, I wanted
to serve my country.

23:44.856 --> 23:48.257
And I found that people
who worked in intelligence

23:48.326 --> 23:50.920
had to grapple
with some serious issues.

23:50.996 --> 23:52.930
Living duplicitous lives,

23:52.931 --> 23:55.866
compartmentalizing
the personal and professional.

23:55.934 --> 23:58.434
It's a difficult challenge.

23:59.304 --> 24:02.762
I presume that you treated
Sydney and Jack Bristow before.

24:02.841 --> 24:04.909
I can't discuss
other patients with you.

24:04.910 --> 24:07.410
Then they were your patients.

24:10.148 --> 24:14.448
I am not here to play games
with you, Mr. Sloane.

24:14.519 --> 24:15.953
Dr. Barnett...

24:15.954 --> 24:18.514
how can we possibly have
an honest conversation

24:18.590 --> 24:21.525
if we can't talk about the most
important people in my life?

24:21.593 --> 24:24.093
You can talk about them.

24:33.271 --> 24:36.365
I'm sorry you came so far,
Dr. Barnett.

24:38.610 --> 24:42.478
I can stay as long as it takes.

24:42.547 --> 24:43.981
We can just sit here

24:43.982 --> 24:45.983
until you feel
more comfortable talking.

24:45.984 --> 24:48.484
I'm afraid that day
will never come.

24:50.922 --> 24:55.450
Well, I will be staying
in Zurich for two more days.

24:57.829 --> 24:59.497
I urge you to consider

24:59.498 --> 25:01.932
that after I return
to the States,

25:01.933 --> 25:04.235
you'll still be feeling
whatever it is

25:04.236 --> 25:06.136
that you were compelled
to call me here for

25:06.137 --> 25:08.637
in the first place.

25:09.274 --> 25:11.308
Here's my number.

25:11.309 --> 25:13.834
If you change your mind.

25:24.990 --> 25:27.124
We just received intel
that 12 hours ago,

25:27.125 --> 25:29.821
Johannes Gathird, the Executive
Director of the Dryden Bank,

25:29.895 --> 25:32.489
was murdered in the garage
of his Berlin office.

25:32.564 --> 25:34.798
Gerard Kronish,
CFO of Chantre Telecom,

25:34.799 --> 25:36.567
was found dead in Paris
40 minutes ago.

25:36.568 --> 25:38.235
The confirmed intel
suggests that both

25:38.236 --> 25:39.703
were high-ranking members
of The Covenant.

25:39.704 --> 25:41.672
They must know we're after
the Doleac Agenda.

25:41.673 --> 25:42.940
They're killing
the names off the list

25:42.941 --> 25:45.441
before we can get to them.

25:46.211 --> 25:48.546
Hi. Is it true you're
moving up the timetable

25:48.547 --> 25:49.580
on the mission to the Alps?

25:49.581 --> 25:50.848
Yes, we're discussing that now.

25:50.849 --> 25:52.683
Sydney and Vaughn,
there's a plane waiting

25:52.684 --> 25:53.684
to take you back to Chamonix.

25:53.685 --> 25:55.686
The override I'm building

25:55.687 --> 25:57.721
to bypass
the lethal response system...

25:57.722 --> 25:58.856
Haven't quite cracked it yet.

25:58.857 --> 26:00.157
How long do you need?

26:00.158 --> 26:02.593
Well, assuming I'm a genius,
six hours.

26:02.594 --> 26:04.228
Can it work remotely?

26:04.229 --> 26:07.062
Yeah, I don't see why not,
but it would require someone

26:07.132 --> 26:08.566
to execute an uplink
in Chamonix.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.901
Jack, you'll go with them
and handle the uplink.

26:10.902 --> 26:13.402
The three of you,
wheels up in 15 minutes.

26:22.447 --> 26:24.281
Comms and encryption
synchronized?

26:24.282 --> 26:25.916
High-band protocol.

26:25.917 --> 26:28.442
Marshall tweaked them
so there's no delay.

26:35.961 --> 26:39.658
I know you requested Weiss
for the last mission.

26:41.499 --> 26:43.999
I understand.

26:47.973 --> 26:51.568
Every day I wish I could go
back in time.

26:51.643 --> 26:54.143
But I can't.

26:55.647 --> 26:58.343
And as much as I...

27:00.285 --> 27:03.311
As much as I still
have feelings for you...

27:05.423 --> 27:08.483
I won't be the other woman.

27:08.560 --> 27:11.060
Not ever.

27:11.129 --> 27:13.629
I know.

27:16.234 --> 27:18.734
According to Lisenker,

27:18.803 --> 27:21.601
the Doleac Agenda is hidden
in the wine cellar.

27:21.673 --> 27:23.173
It's encrypted on a microdot

27:23.174 --> 27:24.675
that Lisenker injected
into the cork

27:24.676 --> 27:27.736
of a bottle of Chateau Margot,
vintage 1953.

27:30.148 --> 27:32.648
Sydney?

27:32.784 --> 27:36.117
Chateau Margot '53.
Got it.

27:47.165 --> 27:48.799
- Hello?
- Hi.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.801
Michael, where are you?

27:50.802 --> 27:52.202
Or can't you say?

27:52.203 --> 27:54.405
I'll be out of town
for a day or so.

27:54.406 --> 27:56.674
Are you all right?

27:56.675 --> 27:59.175
I just miss you.

28:00.679 --> 28:03.080
When you get back,
I'll make you some dinner.

28:03.081 --> 28:04.915
Something delicious.

28:04.916 --> 28:06.517
It's a date.

28:06.518 --> 28:09.018
Be safe, love.

28:47.525 --> 28:50.025
Watchtower's in position.

28:52.363 --> 28:54.863
Copy that.
How's our position?

28:54.866 --> 28:56.934
You look clear.

28:56.935 --> 28:59.435
Establishing uplink.

29:19.824 --> 29:21.725
Base Camp, I've established
a laser link

29:21.726 --> 29:22.626
to the security server.

29:22.627 --> 29:25.028
- Are you receiving the signal?
- Uplink is 5x5.

29:25.029 --> 29:28.658
We're tapped into their security
network, and I'm accessing now.

29:33.438 --> 29:35.572
We're in position
at the tunnel entrance.

29:35.573 --> 29:37.407
Copy. You're patched
through to Base Camp.

29:37.408 --> 29:39.076
Okay, you're gonna have
to take each kill zone

29:39.077 --> 29:40.511
one at a time,
but don't sweat it,

29:40.512 --> 29:42.579
because you can bet your life
on that gear I gave you.

29:42.580 --> 29:44.248
Well, maybe not your...

29:44.249 --> 29:46.749
My life you can bet.
That's fine.

29:46.818 --> 29:48.886
I'm gonna sever
the kill zone's diagnostics

29:48.887 --> 29:50.120
from the main alarm system

29:50.121 --> 29:51.488
so the guards won't know
you're there.

29:51.489 --> 29:52.356
For how long?

29:52.357 --> 29:54.391
You'll need to get through
the lethal response system,

29:54.392 --> 29:57.725
into the wine cellar,
and back again in five minutes.

29:57.796 --> 30:00.296
Start the clock, Base Camp.

30:00.698 --> 30:02.800
Okay, and the five-minute
countdown has been activated.

30:02.801 --> 30:06.066
Initiating phase one
of lethal response system.

30:10.475 --> 30:12.975
Inflating decoy.

30:32.163 --> 30:34.531
- We've cleared the guns.
- Copy, Mountaineer.

30:34.532 --> 30:36.333
4 minutes and 10 seconds
remaining.

30:36.334 --> 30:37.835
- Marshall?
- Yeah.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.169
- It's time.
- Time for what?

30:39.170 --> 30:41.238
The baby.
I'm having a baby.

30:41.239 --> 30:43.106
Oh, my God.
Okay, don't panic here.

30:43.107 --> 30:45.837
We should probably get you
some hot water, a towel...

30:45.910 --> 30:47.544
- No, a hospital.
- Ambulance is on its way.

30:47.545 --> 30:50.045
I don't want to go
till we're married.

30:50.114 --> 30:52.082
You want to get married
to me now?

30:52.083 --> 30:54.251
- Yes.
- You can do it.

30:54.252 --> 30:56.253
You can be certified
online in minutes.

30:56.254 --> 30:57.387
- He can?
- I can?

30:57.388 --> 30:59.389
Base Camp,
Mountaineer and Boy Scout

30:59.390 --> 31:01.258
are at the electrified zone.

31:01.259 --> 31:03.293
- Sign here.
- Marshall?

31:03.294 --> 31:06.161
Exalted minister of the Internet
Church of Mammals?

31:06.231 --> 31:08.165
Oh, just sign it,
for the love of God!

31:08.166 --> 31:10.666
Initiating voltage reading.

31:12.737 --> 31:14.872
- The reading's at 50.
- You'll have to abort.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.074
Your suits are not equipped
to handle that much voltage.

31:17.075 --> 31:19.703
500,000 volts.
That's got to be a mistake.

31:28.186 --> 31:30.686
You've got three minutes.

31:32.056 --> 31:33.657
Stay away from the sides
and the ladder.

31:33.658 --> 31:34.992
Only go down the center.

31:34.993 --> 31:37.860
Okay, as soon as I hit
the ground, go.

31:42.734 --> 31:45.931
Okay, you have 2 minutes
and 30 seconds, Mountaineer.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.540
Okay, 2 minutes 17.

31:57.115 --> 31:59.615
Syd, stay to the center.

32:06.758 --> 32:09.159
Sydney!

32:09.160 --> 32:11.660
You okay?

32:13.298 --> 32:15.798
I'm okay.

32:24.075 --> 32:25.575
We've cleared the second tunnel.

32:25.576 --> 32:26.610
Copy, Mountaineer.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.478
Mountaineer,
you've got a minute 45.

32:28.479 --> 32:30.614
Okay, breathe, honey.
Breathe.

32:30.615 --> 32:32.616
Approaching the third
countermeasure.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.351
Acid kill zone.

32:34.352 --> 32:37.116
We're firing the sealant.

32:40.358 --> 32:42.526
Okay, let's move.

32:42.527 --> 32:44.594
Base Camp,
the sealant better hold.

32:44.595 --> 32:47.095
You're good, Mountaineer.

32:47.832 --> 32:49.633
Marshall,
do you take this woman

32:49.634 --> 32:51.501
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

32:51.502 --> 32:52.502
I do.

32:52.503 --> 32:55.802
And, Carrie,
do you take this man

32:55.873 --> 32:58.373
to be your
lawfully wedded husband?

32:58.977 --> 33:00.177
Take a second.

33:00.178 --> 33:01.545
I do.

33:01.546 --> 33:05.380
Then, by the power vested in me
by the Church of Mammals...

33:05.450 --> 33:07.184
Okay.
Okay.

33:07.185 --> 33:08.318
I got to go to the hospital.

33:08.319 --> 33:10.819
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

33:10.955 --> 33:12.189
I love you, Mrs. Flinkman.

33:12.190 --> 33:14.690
- I'm keeping my name!
- Fine.

33:14.692 --> 33:16.360
We're at the wine cellar.

33:16.361 --> 33:18.061
You only have a minute left

33:18.062 --> 33:19.496
until the alarm system
is back online.

33:19.497 --> 33:22.660
Oh, and, by the way,
I just got married.

33:24.802 --> 33:27.302
Look for the '53 Chateau Margot.

33:29.340 --> 33:31.840
30 seconds.

33:31.909 --> 33:34.409
'59.

33:35.546 --> 33:38.046
'58.

33:38.149 --> 33:40.183
'57.

33:40.184 --> 33:42.352
Got it.

33:42.353 --> 33:43.854
20 seconds.
Mountaineer, report.

33:56.467 --> 33:58.668
Mountaineer, Boy Scout?
Oh, God, get out!

34:17.455 --> 34:18.722
All security teams
have been alerted

34:18.723 --> 34:21.223
to your position, Mountaineer.

34:31.636 --> 34:33.937
Let's go.

34:33.938 --> 34:35.105
Boy Scout and Mountaineer
are clear.

34:35.106 --> 34:36.639
Proceeding to
the rendezvous point.

34:36.641 --> 34:37.940
Copy that.

34:37.942 --> 34:39.643
Oh, I got to go.
My wife's having a baby.

34:39.643 --> 34:42.143
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

34:53.891 --> 34:55.759
Something you should know.

34:55.760 --> 34:59.196
I spent three years studying you

34:59.263 --> 35:01.465
for my postdoctorate
dissertation.

35:01.466 --> 35:04.026
The agency gave me
complete access

35:04.102 --> 35:06.069
to your files from SD-6.

35:06.070 --> 35:10.268
I know the decisions you made,
the people you killed.

35:10.341 --> 35:13.105
I know what happened
to your wife.

35:13.845 --> 35:18.407
And to some degree,
I understand you, Arvin.

35:18.483 --> 35:21.884
And I can help you
if you let me try.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.372
I'll head to Los Angeles.

35:42.373 --> 35:44.407
You go to St. Petersburg
and present our offer

35:44.408 --> 35:46.309
to the head of operations.

35:46.310 --> 35:49.211
When he agrees
to our terms, contact me.

35:51.115 --> 35:53.116
You're not worried
that I might fail

35:53.117 --> 35:55.642
to include your role
in this, are you?

35:57.155 --> 35:59.122
Not in the least.

35:59.123 --> 36:01.819
Especially since
I'll be keeping these.

36:20.745 --> 36:23.578
I manipulate people.

36:23.648 --> 36:25.582
I'm good at that,

36:25.583 --> 36:27.684
and I know it.

36:27.685 --> 36:28.919
I lie.

36:28.920 --> 36:31.288
I keep secrets.

36:31.289 --> 36:33.190
I divulge only what I must

36:33.191 --> 36:35.819
in order to elicit
the reaction I need.

36:35.893 --> 36:41.126
That skill, in part,
is why I'm still alive.

36:43.267 --> 36:44.668
One of those secrets

36:44.669 --> 36:47.968
affects the only two people
I care about in the world.

36:48.539 --> 36:51.039
Sydney and Jack Bristow.

36:52.410 --> 36:55.709
There are many secrets
I enjoy keeping.

36:55.780 --> 36:58.977
There is power in secrets
that you keep.

37:00.952 --> 37:03.452
But this one.

37:04.889 --> 37:07.949
Oh, this one wears on me.

37:08.025 --> 37:10.525
It has for many years.

37:11.362 --> 37:14.229
It's central
to my very existence.

37:14.298 --> 37:16.892
It's who I am.

37:25.843 --> 37:28.343
You were saying?

37:35.686 --> 37:38.186
I appreciate you coming back.

37:38.222 --> 37:40.722
I do.

37:42.326 --> 37:44.826
But I can't do this.

37:46.330 --> 37:48.830
Arvin.

37:49.333 --> 37:51.601
It's important.

37:51.602 --> 37:54.102
I think you should leave.

37:55.339 --> 37:57.839
Right now.

38:12.790 --> 38:15.290
Mr. Sark!

38:22.166 --> 38:23.667
McKenas Cole.

38:23.668 --> 38:26.168
Your hair.

38:26.170 --> 38:28.670
That's cool.

38:30.841 --> 38:32.509
You're the man
behind The Covenant?

38:32.510 --> 38:35.843
I'm the man in front of the man.

38:37.715 --> 38:39.516
When'd you cut your hair?

38:39.517 --> 38:41.351
It wasn't a matter of choice.

38:41.352 --> 38:44.719
I was in U.S. Custody,
as I thought you were.

38:44.789 --> 38:47.289
When were you released?

38:47.291 --> 38:49.791
That's a good story.

38:52.063 --> 38:54.563
To your hair.

38:59.136 --> 39:01.371
I'll be the senior most
Covenant representative

39:01.372 --> 39:02.672
that you'll be dealing with.

39:02.673 --> 39:05.733
Anything you have to say
to the big boss,

39:05.810 --> 39:08.310
you can say to me.

39:08.779 --> 39:10.680
I assume you have
something to say.

39:10.681 --> 39:13.181
I've come to make an offer.

39:13.484 --> 39:16.248
Wouldn't by chance
happen to have anything to do

39:16.320 --> 39:19.847
with the cell leaders
that you wiped out?

39:21.692 --> 39:24.456
It's amazing, the stuff
I know, isn't it?

39:24.929 --> 39:28.365
So, what do you suppose
we do about that?

39:29.834 --> 39:31.868
The fact that you murdered
our cell leaders.

39:31.869 --> 39:34.237
I presume you're smart enough
to know

39:34.238 --> 39:38.538
that I was acting in
The Covenant's best interest.

39:39.844 --> 39:41.511
Julian...

39:41.512 --> 39:43.279
don't do that.

39:43.280 --> 39:45.448
I can see right now
that you're scared.

39:45.449 --> 39:48.316
But you don't need
to be scared of me.

39:48.386 --> 39:52.015
In fact,
I have a present for you.

39:54.392 --> 39:55.725
<i>Voilà.</i>

39:55.726 --> 39:58.226
Look familiar?

39:58.662 --> 40:02.894
And also, two more.

40:06.203 --> 40:08.703
Two more after that.

40:10.207 --> 40:13.005
And one last one.

40:16.614 --> 40:19.114
Did I just blow your mind?

40:31.162 --> 40:32.762
See, when you first
pitched your scheme

40:32.763 --> 40:36.426
to Miss Reed,
she gave me a call.

40:37.668 --> 40:39.269
Truth of the matter is,

40:39.270 --> 40:42.103
you two had my double
thumbs-up from the get-go.

40:42.173 --> 40:43.306
Why?

40:43.307 --> 40:45.608
Because the CIA
is after the Doleac Agenda.

40:45.609 --> 40:46.943
Assume they get it.

40:46.944 --> 40:49.412
They will have the names
of the cell leaders.

40:49.413 --> 40:51.913
You just made my life
so much easier,

40:51.949 --> 40:54.816
because now those names
are irrelevant.

40:58.088 --> 41:00.123
A woman after my own heart.

41:00.124 --> 41:01.858
Glad to hear that,

41:01.859 --> 41:05.022
'cause you two are gonna
continue working together.

41:05.496 --> 41:09.592
You're gonna be heading up
our new North-American cell.

41:11.368 --> 41:13.962
That sounds just about right.

41:14.038 --> 41:16.538
You're cockier than I am.

41:16.841 --> 41:19.341
I love that about you.

41:20.444 --> 41:22.445
Now, of course,

41:22.446 --> 41:25.540
this doesn't absolve you
of your responsibilities

41:25.616 --> 41:28.608
working overtime
as an agent for Uncle Sam.

41:28.686 --> 41:30.053
Of course.

41:30.054 --> 41:32.455
But in the meantime,
may I suggest...

41:32.456 --> 41:34.023
And this is just a suggestion.

41:34.024 --> 41:35.492
That you put the kibosh

41:35.493 --> 41:39.088
on your husband's
extracurricular sex-tivities?

42:18.736 --> 42:21.236
Lauren, hey.

42:22.172 --> 42:24.173
Did you hear about Carrie?
She had her baby.

42:24.174 --> 42:26.209
I see what's going on
between you and Michael,

42:26.210 --> 42:28.710
so let me be clear.

42:29.046 --> 42:31.546
Stay the hell away
from my husband.
