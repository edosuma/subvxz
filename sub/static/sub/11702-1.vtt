WEBVTT

00:05.044 --> 00:06.484
The name says it all.

00:07.644 --> 00:10.084
Wentworth Correctional Center.

00:12.684 --> 00:14.444
It's written all over the building.

00:15.484 --> 00:16.884
It's on our name badges

00:17.724 --> 00:19.604
and our employment contracts.

00:22.604 --> 00:24.324
Think of it as a mission statement.

00:25.364 --> 00:29.484
Society has deemed these women
defective and it's our job to fix them.

00:34.564 --> 00:37.324
Not to pander, to befriend,

00:37.404 --> 00:39.524
to indulge or to accommodate.

00:39.604 --> 00:42.244
We exist to correct.

00:43.004 --> 00:45.884
Now for three months, these
women have had it easy.

00:45.964 --> 00:48.444
Your instability has
given them opportunity.

00:49.484 --> 00:51.964
They'll have established
new systems and networks.

00:52.044 --> 00:54.324
Their confidence will
be at an all-time high.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:07.404 --> 01:08.964
Today, that confidence ends.

01:13.644 --> 01:15.604
Today, we shut their systems down.

01:28.324 --> 01:32.324
We stamp on their opportunities.
We destroy their networks.

01:35.044 --> 01:38.764
Each and every person
here will know their place.

01:45.884 --> 01:47.124
This is a prison,

01:47.644 --> 01:49.404
and we are in charge.

01:49.604 --> 01:51.084
Hold it there.

01:58.164 --> 01:59.604
Step away from the trolley.

02:02.724 --> 02:03.724
Empty it.

02:36.124 --> 02:37.124
Slot her.

02:37.204 --> 02:39.884
It's not my fault, I
swear! I didn't tell her!

02:39.964 --> 02:42.124
I swear to fuckin' God it wasn't me!

02:44.364 --> 02:45.564
And who are you?

02:55.444 --> 02:57.124
My name's Ms. Ferguson.

02:58.524 --> 03:00.244
But you can call me Governor.

03:51.804 --> 03:53.244
No, I don't know much about her,

03:53.324 --> 03:55.604
except she cleaned up
Stone Park in Queensland

03:55.684 --> 03:58.244
and they gave her the
nickname of 'The Fixer'.

03:58.884 --> 04:01.564
But I reckon we can do better
than that, don't you? The Fixer?

04:01.644 --> 04:03.284
- That's stupid.
- Hey, we got 'em.

04:03.364 --> 04:04.484
- Who?
- Them.

04:07.964 --> 04:09.124
Let 'em go.

04:12.844 --> 04:14.364
Start talking.

04:14.444 --> 04:16.844
- It wasn't my fault.
- I just did what you said.

04:16.923 --> 04:20.084
- Me either. It must have been Sky.
- Sky's job was to push a trolley.

04:20.164 --> 04:22.644
It was yours to get the gear off
the driver and hide it in the bag.

04:22.804 --> 04:25.124
- Yeah, that's what we did.
- What, right in front of the new Governor?

04:25.204 --> 04:26.964
- No one saw us, I swear.
- No?

04:27.044 --> 04:28.964
So how the fuck did she know where it was?

04:30.524 --> 04:31.684
Okay.

04:32.644 --> 04:33.964
One of you screwed up.

04:34.564 --> 04:36.684
One of you ruined my whole fucking system.

04:37.684 --> 04:38.964
Okay?

04:39.524 --> 04:41.524
So who's got the guts to step up, huh?

04:41.604 --> 04:43.564
Who's going to take some responsibility?

04:43.644 --> 04:45.364
- Oh, Franky, come on.
- Who was it?

04:47.684 --> 04:48.884
Okay.

04:49.084 --> 04:50.644
You know how the Romans settled this shit?

04:52.444 --> 04:53.684
Booms.

04:53.764 --> 04:55.724
- Put 'em in your cell.
- What? Why mine?

04:55.804 --> 04:57.124
Just do it.

04:57.204 --> 04:59.004
Don't... Don't touch anything.

05:00.764 --> 05:01.924
Okay.

05:02.284 --> 05:03.484
Now you're gonna slug it out.

05:04.004 --> 05:06.524
- The winner gets to walk.
- Okay, you've taught 'em a lesson, Franky.

05:06.604 --> 05:07.764
Now let 'em go!

05:07.844 --> 05:09.524
Now who's gonna throw the first punch?

05:10.804 --> 05:12.684
- Do it.
- We don't have to do this.

05:13.404 --> 05:15.404
If we both say no, she can't...

05:17.644 --> 05:18.644
Oh!

05:18.964 --> 05:20.284
Now you finish it.

05:26.604 --> 05:28.764
You can't make 'em do it. It's sick.

05:28.844 --> 05:30.524
Shut the door. I don't want to hear it.

05:52.564 --> 05:53.764
- Fletch.
- Mate.

05:54.284 --> 05:56.564
So, where's my duty free, buddy?

05:57.004 --> 05:58.604
I suppose you've drunk it all?

05:58.764 --> 06:00.564
Nope, I'm off the grog, mate.

06:00.964 --> 06:02.124
Four weeks tomorrow.

06:02.284 --> 06:05.604
What, a month in Bali and
you never touched a drop?

06:05.684 --> 06:08.724
Correct. Yeah, it's part of the new
stress management thing I'm doing.

06:09.484 --> 06:10.804
- Nice one.
- Yeah.

06:11.484 --> 06:14.244
I see Ferguson lucked out finding
contraband on her first morning.

06:14.324 --> 06:15.604
Yeah, I bet she was tipped off.

06:15.684 --> 06:17.444
You know, someone's
obviously sucking up to her.

06:18.844 --> 06:19.884
Welcome back.

06:20.124 --> 06:21.164
Hey, Vera.

06:21.244 --> 06:23.884
I wanted to say hi after the
meeting, but you kind of did a runner.

06:23.964 --> 06:25.364
I had to call the hospital.

06:26.764 --> 06:27.804
I'll leave you guys to it.

06:29.764 --> 06:33.964
I'm, uh, sorry, to hear about
your Mum. How's she doing?

06:35.404 --> 06:38.644
The oncologist says she's only got a
few weeks, so I'm moving her back home.

06:38.724 --> 06:41.124
- And you're going to keep working?
- Yeah, I need to.

06:41.204 --> 06:42.364
Well, you know, if
there's anything I can do.

06:42.444 --> 06:43.964
No. No, thanks.

06:46.684 --> 06:48.244
Hey, um, I got you something.

06:52.324 --> 06:53.564
In Bali.

06:55.124 --> 06:56.124
Okay.

07:02.924 --> 07:05.324
They reckon it stimulates
positive energy. I...

07:05.404 --> 07:07.804
I thought, you know, it
might be good, you know, um,

07:08.404 --> 07:09.524
with your mum.

07:10.924 --> 07:12.724
So here's where you're hiding.

07:14.484 --> 07:15.724
I need you in Medical.

07:15.844 --> 07:16.924
Of course.

07:32.004 --> 07:34.644
- Not talking?
- I'm not sure they can.

07:34.724 --> 07:36.004
Any theories?

07:36.084 --> 07:38.964
Ah, it could be a reprisal for the
contraband you found this morning.

07:39.484 --> 07:41.724
These prisoners are out of control.

07:41.804 --> 07:44.244
Erica Davidson was
clearly out of her depth.

07:44.524 --> 07:45.844
Oh, she did her best.

07:46.844 --> 07:50.124
We've been understaffed since she
left, and Mr. Channing was hardly ever

07:51.284 --> 07:52.364
here, and...

07:53.644 --> 07:56.164
Which of the inmates stepped
up when Jacs Holt was killed?

07:56.244 --> 07:59.044
Bea Smith was the favorite,
but since she wasn't around,

07:59.124 --> 08:01.084
Franky Doyle took over. She's in H2.

08:01.964 --> 08:03.124
I'll see her.

08:05.164 --> 08:06.324
Now.

08:30.244 --> 08:31.964
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- No.

08:32.044 --> 08:33.244
Thank you, Ms. Miles.

08:34.604 --> 08:36.683
First day's always a nightmare.
I haven't even eaten yet.

08:36.764 --> 08:39.443
Oh, you should join us for
lunch. I make a killer omelet.

08:39.844 --> 08:42.884
That's right. You won the
breakfast round of that TV show.

08:44.164 --> 08:45.764
What was your winning dish again?

08:45.844 --> 08:49.124
- Caramelized onion and...
- Sweet potato. Yes, I remember.

08:50.324 --> 08:52.164
Well, as tempting as that is,

08:52.804 --> 08:54.884
I prefer to eat alone. It's useful.

08:55.484 --> 08:56.964
- Thinking time.
- Hmm.

08:57.324 --> 08:59.764
You've redecorated. I'm
not sure about the color.

09:00.324 --> 09:03.004
Ms. Davidson and I clearly
have very different tastes.

09:06.164 --> 09:07.804
Well, the Department are idiots.

09:08.244 --> 09:09.484
She was a good Governor.

09:09.564 --> 09:12.044
I gather that you two really hit it off.

09:12.884 --> 09:14.724
Hmm, we understood each other.

09:14.844 --> 09:16.404
I'd like to understand you, Franky.

09:16.564 --> 09:17.964
Ooh, that's a bit forward.

09:21.044 --> 09:25.684
I need someone with smarts and influence
to help me keep the women in line.

09:26.244 --> 09:29.004
Someone to help stop
contraband supply in its tracks.

09:29.084 --> 09:30.564
I wouldn't know anything about that.

09:32.404 --> 09:33.884
If we work together,

09:34.924 --> 09:36.804
it could be mutually beneficial.

09:38.964 --> 09:40.124
What's in it for me?

09:42.164 --> 09:44.044
You must be feeling the pressure.

09:44.804 --> 09:46.364
It's lonely at the top.

09:46.444 --> 09:47.724
Dangerous, too.

09:48.364 --> 09:50.364
Only the best get to stay there.

09:50.444 --> 09:53.164
The rest, they end up like Jacqueline Holt.

09:57.844 --> 10:01.084
Cooperate with me and I'll ensure
that you stay where you belong.

10:01.164 --> 10:02.204
What if I say no?

10:03.604 --> 10:05.044
I'll find somebody else.

10:05.684 --> 10:07.444
There's plenty of contenders out there.

10:08.924 --> 10:10.524
Well, quid pro quo.

10:10.604 --> 10:12.324
I need to look after my girls.

10:13.084 --> 10:14.484
What would you like?

10:15.124 --> 10:17.524
Well, for starters, Kim
Chang's doing her CPA.

10:17.604 --> 10:19.964
And I've been helping her, but,
I've got my own study to worry about.

10:20.084 --> 10:21.204
I can arrange that.

10:21.884 --> 10:23.084
So we have a deal.

10:23.684 --> 10:25.124
We'll chat again soon.

10:34.484 --> 10:36.644
Oh, nearly forgot.

10:36.724 --> 10:38.364
I believe these are yours.

10:40.884 --> 10:42.164
What the fuck.

10:45.124 --> 10:47.764
- These were meant to be posted.
- To an ex-Governor?

10:47.844 --> 10:50.284
I expect Mr. Channing felt
that was inappropriate.

10:52.284 --> 10:53.444
You read 'em?

11:03.124 --> 11:04.724
Ferguson's a fucking player.

11:05.204 --> 11:06.684
What's she done now?

11:08.244 --> 11:11.364
- What are they?
- Unless you've got good news, piss off.

11:11.764 --> 11:15.324
Well, the girls in D-Block are
bitching about the bust this morning.

11:15.404 --> 11:18.444
- Actually C-Block are pretty pissed, too.
- Booms, I said good news.

11:19.564 --> 11:21.764
Oh, ah. Oh, hey, this might cheer you up.

11:22.884 --> 11:24.164
Hang on.

11:26.444 --> 11:27.564
I told you to keep that stashed.

11:27.644 --> 11:30.404
- Yeah, I videoed the scrag fight.
- What the hell did you do that for?

11:30.484 --> 11:31.844
Hello! It's a scrag fight.

11:32.724 --> 11:33.764
Fuck!

11:33.884 --> 11:35.884
The phone is for deals only. If
I find out you've been calling

11:35.964 --> 11:37.764
- your boyfriend again...
- No. No.

11:37.844 --> 11:41.044
No, 'cause I wouldn't, and
I didn't and I wouldn't.

11:41.764 --> 11:43.244
- How many times?
- Just once.

11:43.324 --> 11:45.124
But listen. No, listen. Listen.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.324
Me sister reckons he's
rooting someone else, eh.

11:49.444 --> 11:51.364
How much of the fight did you film?

11:51.444 --> 11:54.084
- Eh?
- How much of the fight did you film?

11:55.084 --> 11:57.124
Oh, just... Just the good bits,
when they were on the floor.

11:57.244 --> 12:00.604
Lindsay pulled Sarah's hair
out and she went boonta.

12:07.804 --> 12:09.124
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:09.204 --> 12:11.244
- Hey, how was the visit?
- Oh, great.

12:11.324 --> 12:13.924
Kaiya's getting so tall.

12:14.004 --> 12:15.084
And she's done you a drawing.

12:15.164 --> 12:16.884
The screws said they'd
bring it in later for you.

12:16.964 --> 12:18.404
- Oh, nice.
- Yeah.

12:18.484 --> 12:19.884
Hey, um...

12:19.964 --> 12:21.244
Heard about the girls.

12:21.684 --> 12:23.164
I tried to see 'em, but
they're still in Medical.

12:23.244 --> 12:26.324
Oh, it was bloody horrible.
Franky is losing the plot.

12:26.404 --> 12:28.284
She's worse since Davidson left.

12:28.364 --> 12:30.524
Well, she's scared. She knows
she's got a target on her back.

12:30.604 --> 12:32.444
- Especially with the bust this morning.
- Yeah.

12:32.524 --> 12:34.964
Hey, they reckon Tanya from
C-Block's gonna make a move soon

12:35.044 --> 12:36.964
and Lou Kelly's been
shooting her mouth off.

12:37.044 --> 12:38.644
Oh, I am so sick of it.

12:38.724 --> 12:40.804
You'll be out soon. You
won't have to think about it.

12:40.884 --> 12:43.444
Yeah.

12:43.524 --> 12:44.844
Who's got the green thumb?

12:44.924 --> 12:47.924
Ah, this is Doreen Anderson, and
Liz Birdsworth, our Peer Workers.

12:48.004 --> 12:49.004
Hi.

12:49.084 --> 12:51.124
- You're doing a great job.
- Oh, it's not just me.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.004
Liz knows heaps about plants and stuff.

12:53.084 --> 12:55.004
You're due for parole soon.

12:55.084 --> 12:56.324
Yeah. Couple of months.

12:56.404 --> 12:57.964
I'll arrange a meeting. We
can have a talk about another

12:58.044 --> 13:00.484
potential Peer Worker
for when Liz leaves us.

13:00.564 --> 13:01.804
Sure.

13:02.324 --> 13:04.124
- These roses look good.
- Yeah.

13:04.204 --> 13:07.284
Yeah, we planted those for Bea
Smith. They're her favorites.

13:07.364 --> 13:09.764
Yes, I've heard a lot about this Bea Smith.

13:10.364 --> 13:12.324
Seems to have made quite an impact.

13:19.004 --> 13:20.444
It's a beautiful day today.

13:21.844 --> 13:24.364
- Let's go for a walk.
- Not till I find the right dress.

13:25.444 --> 13:27.684
The formal's weeks away.
You've got loads of time.

13:28.244 --> 13:29.564
It has to be perfect, Mum.

13:29.964 --> 13:31.204
It will be.

13:32.284 --> 13:33.404
I promise.

13:35.084 --> 13:36.844
All right, ladies, that's us for today.

13:36.924 --> 13:38.604
I'll see you on Friday, okay?

13:39.964 --> 13:41.844
Thank you, Mr. J.

13:42.284 --> 13:43.924
And don't forget your diaries.

13:46.644 --> 13:47.644
Governor.

13:50.604 --> 13:53.364
I hear you've taken on
Erica's education programs.

13:53.444 --> 13:54.804
Yeah, someone had to.

13:54.884 --> 13:55.964
And what's this one?

13:56.044 --> 13:58.644
Ah, it's a drug and
alcohol treatment program.

13:58.884 --> 14:01.484
We educate the prisoners
about addiction, and try to...

14:01.564 --> 14:03.124
There are no drugs in prison.

14:04.684 --> 14:05.964
In theory, no, but...

14:06.044 --> 14:07.764
If you rely on a support group,

14:07.844 --> 14:10.164
that's like throwing our hands up
and saying we can't do our jobs.

14:10.244 --> 14:11.444
Contraband's always going to get in...

14:11.524 --> 14:15.484
When I arrived at Stone Park, every
second inmate was addicted to something.

14:15.564 --> 14:18.084
When I left, there were
no drugs in my prison.

14:19.644 --> 14:21.244
No hand holding,

14:21.324 --> 14:22.644
no support groups.

14:23.004 --> 14:24.444
I just cut the supply.

14:25.444 --> 14:27.324
That's what I'll be doing here.

14:27.404 --> 14:28.524
Okay.

14:31.484 --> 14:34.684
Your background is in social
work, isn't it, Mr. Jackson?

14:34.764 --> 14:36.004
Ah, yes.

14:36.524 --> 14:38.164
Why the career change?

14:39.404 --> 14:42.684
I had a, uh, bad experience.

14:43.124 --> 14:46.684
Yes, I read your file, but, the...

14:47.284 --> 14:48.884
The details have escaped me.

14:51.404 --> 14:54.524
Was it something about
a mother and a child?

14:54.964 --> 14:56.164
I had to separate them.

14:56.404 --> 14:57.964
And do you think you
made the right decision?

14:58.044 --> 14:59.244
What kind of question is that?

14:59.724 --> 15:00.924
Do you?

15:03.804 --> 15:05.044
The boy was at risk.

15:05.764 --> 15:08.324
I didn't know the mother
was going to kill herself.

15:08.404 --> 15:11.004
A social conscience can
be helpful, Mr. Jackson.

15:11.644 --> 15:14.764
But sometimes, as you've
learned, it backfires.

15:16.964 --> 15:19.964
That will be the last meeting
of the drug and alcohol group.

15:21.444 --> 15:23.524
Governor, there's a
reporter here to see you.

15:23.604 --> 15:25.204
I don't give interviews.

15:25.284 --> 15:27.164
Well, you might want to speak to this one.

15:32.844 --> 15:34.804
That was sent to our main news desk.

15:35.444 --> 15:38.324
The text message said it was shot
inside Wentworth this morning.

15:38.404 --> 15:40.124
Don't believe everything you read.

15:40.524 --> 15:43.364
You can't see their faces, but,
they're wearing your uniforms.

15:43.444 --> 15:45.724
We don't have the monopoly
on teal tracksuits.

15:46.844 --> 15:48.804
This was staged, Ms. Jovanka,

15:48.884 --> 15:51.244
somewhere outside this prison
and you've fallen for it.

15:53.964 --> 15:56.084
I'm running this story,
with or without your comment.

15:56.164 --> 15:59.604
Well, if you do run it, you'll be burning
your bridges with me and my prison.

15:59.684 --> 16:01.724
Any future news will be
handed to your opposition

16:01.804 --> 16:03.884
and you're going to find
yourself in charge of the comics.

16:06.124 --> 16:07.444
And if I spike it?

16:09.044 --> 16:11.844
I'll give you advance
warning on any proper news.

16:13.404 --> 16:14.404
It's your choice.

16:17.764 --> 16:18.884
Okay.

16:36.764 --> 16:39.084
Do we know where that
fight was this morning?

16:39.164 --> 16:40.284
Somewhere in H-Block.

16:40.484 --> 16:42.204
This was Franky Doyle, wasn't it?

16:42.284 --> 16:44.484
It is her style. She's big on social media.

16:46.404 --> 16:48.644
- Shall I authorize a cell toss?
- Not yet.

16:49.964 --> 16:53.044
First, I want you to
tell me about Bea Smith.

16:54.804 --> 16:56.364
All right, are your eyes still closed?

16:56.444 --> 16:57.644
Yes.

17:00.324 --> 17:01.644
Open them.

17:02.444 --> 17:04.723
Mum, it's gorgeous!

17:05.164 --> 17:06.644
Well, try it on.

17:12.044 --> 17:13.324
It's just the neighbors.

17:18.404 --> 17:20.124
- What was that?
- Nothing.

17:20.924 --> 17:22.924
Everything's fine. Just try the dress on.

17:24.564 --> 17:25.844
Just ignore them, Deb.

17:26.844 --> 17:29.004
What if it's my date? He could be early.

17:31.364 --> 17:33.324
Mum, what have you done?

17:36.764 --> 17:37.844
Oh...

17:38.404 --> 17:39.604
Don't answer it, Deb.

17:40.044 --> 17:41.804
You just stay in here with me, okay?

17:42.324 --> 17:43.644
Just don't answer it.

18:02.004 --> 18:03.204
Debbie.

18:03.964 --> 18:06.284
She had a complete breakdown
after the sentencing.

18:06.364 --> 18:08.684
Mr. Channing was keeping her sedated.

18:08.764 --> 18:11.204
- Debbie...
- Debbie, that's her daughter?

18:11.604 --> 18:13.004
Deceased, yes.

18:14.484 --> 18:19.284
So her initial charges were dropped,
but she got 12 years for the Holt murder?

18:19.364 --> 18:20.484
Manslaughter.

18:25.324 --> 18:27.844
Have the doctor bring me
a list of her medication.

18:29.204 --> 18:32.204
I think it's time Bea Smith
joined the land of the living.

18:44.700 --> 18:46.540
- The color's amazing, isn't it?
- Yeah.

18:46.620 --> 18:48.380
I reckon she's gonna be in big trouble, eh?

18:48.460 --> 18:51.380
Ferguson might think she's in
charge, but she's in for a shock.

18:51.460 --> 18:52.780
Yeah. D-Block don't care about her.

18:52.860 --> 18:54.660
They just want their gear. They're like...

18:54.740 --> 18:57.500
Okay. Well, you can tell D-Block that
they can take a fucking chill pill.

18:57.580 --> 18:59.900
That goes for everyone else. They
get their gear when they relax.

18:59.980 --> 19:01.620
Hey! Bea.

19:02.900 --> 19:04.620
- Bea!
- No way.

19:09.820 --> 19:11.140
Hey, Bea.

19:11.300 --> 19:12.340
Aw!

19:16.860 --> 19:19.660
All right, ladies. Come on, give her
some space, please. Give her some room.

19:19.740 --> 19:21.300
Hey, is she all right?

19:21.380 --> 19:23.340
Yeah, she'll be fine. Just
leave her alone for now.

19:23.420 --> 19:25.700
Where are you taking her? Ms.
Bennett? Where are you taking her?

19:25.780 --> 19:27.700
- She's coming back.
- Got a pen?

19:38.420 --> 19:39.620
Your old unit's full,

19:39.700 --> 19:42.580
but the Governor wants you
in H-4, close to your friends.

19:49.340 --> 19:51.500
Okay, you're in here.

19:54.020 --> 19:56.380
Um, look, we'll have your
belongings here over later.

19:57.860 --> 19:59.060
Are you okay?

19:59.700 --> 20:00.820
I feel weird.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.500
Well, the Governor wants you off
the sedatives, so you'll need to rest

20:03.580 --> 20:05.700
- until they're out of your system.
- No, I want my medication.

20:05.780 --> 20:07.300
I'm sorry, Bea.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.500
That's pretty harsh
making her go cold turkey.

20:09.580 --> 20:12.420
As long as Ferguson's cleared it with
the doctor, it's worked for her before.

20:12.500 --> 20:13.860
But why make her dry out in the compound?

20:13.940 --> 20:15.540
Well, I don't know,
Will. It's not up to me.

20:15.620 --> 20:16.740
Whoa.

20:17.020 --> 20:18.060
Sorry.

20:18.140 --> 20:20.780
07 to 03, phone call for you at reception.

20:20.860 --> 20:23.180
Yeah, received. I'll be right
there. It'll be the hospital.

20:23.260 --> 20:26.900
Ah, Ms. Bennett, is it okay
if we go and say hello to Bea?

20:27.540 --> 20:29.300
- Yeah, go on through.
- Thanks.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.220
She in there?

20:33.300 --> 20:34.300
Yeah.

20:34.940 --> 20:35.940
Debbie...

20:37.220 --> 20:38.300
What's she doing?

20:40.300 --> 20:41.820
- Hey, love.
- Hey.

20:41.900 --> 20:43.740
Hey, I didn't mean to scare you.

20:43.980 --> 20:46.100
- We got you presents.
- Hey.

20:46.180 --> 20:48.780
We got your favorites, old ginger snaps.

20:48.860 --> 20:52.020
Hello, it's good to see you.

20:52.100 --> 20:53.100
Oh.

20:54.740 --> 20:56.580
You don't look too crash hot, though.

20:57.660 --> 20:59.940
The girls are rapt to see
you. You're a real hero.

21:00.020 --> 21:01.580
- Franky's top dog now.
- Kaiya's going well.

21:01.660 --> 21:02.980
She's loving living with her Grandma.

21:03.060 --> 21:04.140
There's a few newbies for you to meet.

21:04.220 --> 21:05.780
You can do that in the next couple of days.

21:08.540 --> 21:09.580
Bea?

21:10.500 --> 21:11.500
Bea!

21:12.620 --> 21:14.460
- Attention compound.
- Sorry.

21:14.540 --> 21:16.340
All women are to return
to their units immediately.

21:16.420 --> 21:17.900
You sure you're all right?

21:18.420 --> 21:19.460
It's too early for the count.

21:19.540 --> 21:20.820
Yeah, we'd better go though.

21:26.060 --> 21:28.380
All right, ladies! Stand at your cells!

21:28.460 --> 21:30.140
We're out, we're out.

21:30.820 --> 21:32.380
- What's going on?
- Boomer, out.

21:32.460 --> 21:33.900
- Come on, move it. Move it.
- Hey, hey...

21:33.980 --> 21:36.340
Hey, hey, careful. Just made my bed.

21:37.620 --> 21:39.220
What are they looking for?

21:40.060 --> 21:41.780
- What do you reckon?
- I don't know.

21:43.780 --> 21:45.380
Shit, the phone!

21:47.140 --> 21:49.900
- It's under me mattress, Franky.
- Just shut up and keep calm.

21:49.980 --> 21:51.500
No, no, he's gonna find it.

21:56.100 --> 21:57.260
Boomer!

21:58.340 --> 21:59.340
Yeah?

22:00.780 --> 22:03.100
You can't keep this shit
under your mattress, huh?

22:03.180 --> 22:04.340
You know the rules.

22:05.020 --> 22:06.500
Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

22:09.380 --> 22:11.580
- He should have found it.
- Yeah, I moved it.

22:11.700 --> 22:13.740
- Oh...
- My screw tipped me off.

22:13.860 --> 22:16.260
Anyway, Ferguson's too late.
The footage is already out there.

22:16.340 --> 22:17.340
Oh, right.

22:23.340 --> 22:24.900
- Seen Red?
- Yeah.

22:25.940 --> 22:27.660
- How is she?
- Oh, she's pretty out of it.

22:28.740 --> 22:30.620
- She got a plan?
- Plan?

22:31.380 --> 22:32.420
I don't know.

22:32.500 --> 22:34.140
I don't think she's got any plans.

22:34.460 --> 22:35.460
Well, good.

22:51.500 --> 22:52.500
Mum?

23:35.340 --> 23:36.420
No, no. All...

23:36.980 --> 23:38.780
All I'm asking is that someone...

23:39.540 --> 23:41.860
Could someone just call
me with an exact time?

23:42.500 --> 23:43.660
Well, we're gonna look into it.

23:43.740 --> 23:46.140
- Thank you.
- No worries. Have a good day.

23:48.180 --> 23:49.180
Vera.

23:49.540 --> 23:50.580
Is everything okay?

23:50.860 --> 23:53.100
Yeah, Mum's coming home today, so...

23:53.740 --> 23:55.340
You need me to cover your shift?

23:58.500 --> 23:59.500
No, thanks.

23:59.580 --> 24:00.620
- You sure?
- Yeah.

24:00.900 --> 24:02.340
- Morning, Governor.
- Vera.

24:04.580 --> 24:07.020
I've got a few jobs for
you today, Mr. Fletcher.

24:13.860 --> 24:15.580
- Mate.
- Mmm.

24:15.660 --> 24:17.940
- Saw you on surveillance.
- Yep.

24:18.020 --> 24:19.820
Jane Ormond had a big night.

24:20.540 --> 24:21.980
Why don't you get one
of the women to do it?

24:22.100 --> 24:25.020
Well, Ferguson doesn't
want prisoners down here.

24:25.100 --> 24:26.820
At least that's what she says.

24:27.500 --> 24:30.140
You know, I reckon she's got it in
for me because I went for her job.

24:30.220 --> 24:33.980
Well, if she sends you to do the
monthly spend, then you can get paranoid.

24:34.060 --> 24:36.140
Well, that's where I draw the line, mate.

24:36.220 --> 24:39.220
I don't mind mopping out the wet cells,
but I'm not shopping for the fanny wash.

24:41.340 --> 24:43.260
Reckon you were robbed, buddy.

24:43.340 --> 24:44.460
You would have made a great Governor.

24:44.540 --> 24:45.740
You know, Channing thought
I had it in the bag.

24:45.820 --> 24:46.820
Yeah?

24:46.900 --> 24:49.260
But apparently Ferguson's
got friends in high places.

24:49.340 --> 24:51.140
Came in over Channing's head.

24:51.820 --> 24:53.380
- Let's see how long she lasts.
- Hmm.

24:54.780 --> 24:57.580
Hey, you know, I ran
into the new nurse before.

24:57.660 --> 24:58.780
She's pretty smoking', mate.

24:59.140 --> 25:01.700
- Her name's Rose, Fletch.
- Oh, Rose.

25:02.300 --> 25:05.060
- Had a crack, have you?
- Fuck off.

25:05.900 --> 25:07.380
- You should have a crack.
- Yeah?

25:07.460 --> 25:09.220
Yeah. Yeah. Well, you've missed a spot.

25:09.300 --> 25:10.540
Get your big loafers out of here.

25:10.620 --> 25:12.700
Why don't you go down to
Medical and have an examination?

25:12.780 --> 25:13.780
I will.

25:16.820 --> 25:19.620
It'll only be for an hour or two
and I'll make up the time tomorrow.

25:19.700 --> 25:21.220
Will you need to take any leave?

25:21.300 --> 25:23.540
No, no, I've hired a part time nurse, so...

25:25.060 --> 25:26.940
This job's important to you, isn't it Vera?

25:27.820 --> 25:28.820
Yeah.

25:28.900 --> 25:31.020
I'm very impressed with your work ethic.

25:31.620 --> 25:33.820
Corrections need more people like you.

25:34.540 --> 25:38.060
I read somewhere that you'd been
passed over for promotion several times.

25:38.140 --> 25:40.580
That must be frustrating
for someone with your...

25:40.980 --> 25:42.300
Potential.

25:42.700 --> 25:45.340
Well, wish the Department saw it like that.

25:45.660 --> 25:47.140
You just need a mentor.

25:48.420 --> 25:50.820
I'm a great believer
in succession planning.

25:52.180 --> 25:53.660
I'd really appreciate that.

25:53.740 --> 25:55.940
You stick with me. We'll
achieve great things together.

25:57.180 --> 26:00.940
Thank you. And I promise I won't let
personal issues get in the way of my work.

26:01.500 --> 26:03.300
Get me Kim Chang's education paperwork

26:03.380 --> 26:04.940
I'd like to have a look
at her study preferences.

26:05.020 --> 26:06.060
Yes, Governor.

26:11.380 --> 26:14.100
Your PR stunt failed. Just so you know.

26:14.900 --> 26:16.500
I don't know what you're talking about.

26:16.580 --> 26:19.660
I'm so disappointed. I
had high hopes for us.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.620
Still, it's no great loss.

26:23.700 --> 26:24.900
There'll be others.

26:28.820 --> 26:31.700
You know the worst thing
about being on top, Franky?

26:32.660 --> 26:34.220
The only way is down.

26:36.300 --> 26:38.180
Jacqueline Holt learned the hard way.

26:38.780 --> 26:40.020
You might be next.

26:40.540 --> 26:41.860
You don't scare me.

26:43.500 --> 26:44.740
Likewise.

26:45.580 --> 26:48.060
The women might buy
that tough girl act, but,

26:48.140 --> 26:49.860
they didn't see those letters.

26:54.540 --> 26:56.380
- Booms! I need you.
- Yeah?

26:56.580 --> 26:58.980
- Oh, no. I gotta try Daz again.
- Now.

26:59.260 --> 27:00.940
But... Fuck!

27:08.660 --> 27:10.060
Welcome back, Red!

27:10.780 --> 27:12.540
Boomer, just let me go.

27:12.620 --> 27:14.740
Now, three months is a long time,

27:14.820 --> 27:17.660
and a lot of things have changed around
here, so I just wanted to catch you up.

27:17.740 --> 27:20.060
- Please...
- I'm in charge now, you understand?

27:20.140 --> 27:22.100
- Yeah.
- Bring her over.

27:26.700 --> 27:28.340
Who's in charge? Say it.

27:28.700 --> 27:29.820
Ow! Just let me go.

27:36.380 --> 27:38.620
Who's in charge? Say it.

27:39.140 --> 27:41.180
- You are.
- Mmm-hmm.

27:41.260 --> 27:43.420
- And who runs this place?
- You do.

27:57.540 --> 28:00.580
You all heard that,
right? Yeah? She said it?

28:01.260 --> 28:02.820
Spread the word.

28:04.060 --> 28:05.300
Let her go.

28:18.180 --> 28:21.100
Sorry, Red. Just something I had to do.

28:35.660 --> 28:38.260
- What's got into you?
- I want to fuck.

28:41.300 --> 28:42.540
Oh, Franky.

28:42.700 --> 28:44.380
- Franky. Slow down.
- Shut up.

29:04.140 --> 29:05.980
Bea? You all right, love?

29:07.780 --> 29:11.380
Hey, hey. Hey, hey. You shouldn't
have to put up with that crap, darling.

29:13.780 --> 29:14.940
I can't see her.

29:15.940 --> 29:17.260
You can't see who?

29:18.500 --> 29:19.500
Debbie.

29:22.460 --> 29:25.540
Oh, Bea. Darling, Debbie's gone.

29:29.580 --> 29:30.860
No.

29:31.100 --> 29:32.340
No, I can talk to her.

29:35.340 --> 29:36.980
I just need my medication.

29:39.940 --> 29:42.380
I just need my medication.

29:44.820 --> 29:47.260
I need my medication!

29:47.340 --> 29:50.380
- Bea...
- Bea, calm down, darling.

29:50.740 --> 29:53.180
- Get out of here!
- Hey! You've gotta calm down.

29:53.260 --> 29:54.580
No, I need my medication!

29:54.660 --> 29:58.180
Bea, the screws will come and they will
stick you in the wet cell, darling, hey.

29:58.260 --> 29:59.700
Bea, it's all right...

29:59.780 --> 30:02.340
- I want my medication!
- Back away. Back away. Back away.

30:02.420 --> 30:04.540
- What's going on?
- She's just a bit freaked out.

30:04.620 --> 30:07.300
Move away. Move away. Move away!

30:07.380 --> 30:09.500
- I want to talk to her! I can talk to her!
- Bea, Bea...

30:09.580 --> 30:11.700
- I want to her see her!
- Okay, Bea.

30:11.780 --> 30:13.540
Bea, settle down. You need to settle down.

30:13.620 --> 30:15.660
- I can see her!
- Okay, Bea.

30:16.340 --> 30:18.820
- What is it you need? Come on.
- I need my medication.

30:18.900 --> 30:21.780
Okay, I'll take you to
infirmary, all right?

30:21.940 --> 30:23.380
- Yeah.
- You good to walk?

30:27.820 --> 30:29.660
- Please!
- You have to calm down, Bea, breathe.

30:29.740 --> 30:31.260
Please, please.

30:33.500 --> 30:35.540
Cold turkey's too much for
her. She can't handle it.

30:37.220 --> 30:39.060
The first 36 hours are the worst.

30:39.140 --> 30:40.940
She'll feel better by the morning.

30:41.220 --> 30:42.380
This isn't right.

30:43.940 --> 30:46.380
Your concern is noted, Mr. Jackson.

30:46.460 --> 30:47.660
Keep me updated.

31:04.140 --> 31:06.700
She's tired now. She might
actually get some sleep.

31:06.780 --> 31:07.940
Okay.

31:08.020 --> 31:09.820
Listen, is someone keeping an eye on her?

31:09.900 --> 31:13.220
Yeah, yeah. I've offered to
stay on, do a double shift.

31:14.620 --> 31:16.780
- Sucks to be you.
- Uh.

31:17.340 --> 31:19.740
What do you think of
this cold turkey thing?

31:20.260 --> 31:23.540
I think you should be careful
starting fights with the new Governor.

31:24.660 --> 31:26.140
So you agree with her?

31:26.660 --> 31:27.740
I didn't say that.

31:29.860 --> 31:31.220
So you agree with me?

31:32.180 --> 31:34.420
Why don't you shut up and get me a coffee?

31:34.740 --> 31:35.860
Make it strong.

32:07.380 --> 32:08.820
I fucking knew it.

32:09.060 --> 32:10.540
What?

32:10.620 --> 32:12.620
Oh, she's put me on the special spend.

32:12.700 --> 32:15.540
So? It's a few hours down the shopping
center. What's to complain about?

32:16.980 --> 32:18.660
Is there a problem?

32:20.940 --> 32:22.340
Why have you put me on the spend?

32:22.860 --> 32:25.540
Does the Y-chromosome prevent
you from pushing a trolley?

32:27.460 --> 32:29.060
- No.
- Well, then,

32:29.980 --> 32:32.980
from now on male and female
officers will do the special spend.

32:34.420 --> 32:37.700
Vera will be late this morning, so I'll
need you to handle a prisoner transfer.

32:37.900 --> 32:39.420
- Sure.
- Kim Chang.

32:39.820 --> 32:41.100
Moving into D-Block.

32:41.700 --> 32:44.820
She's requested to further her studies,
so we'll put her with the others in D-4.

32:44.900 --> 32:46.540
Franky's not going to be happy about that.

32:47.420 --> 32:49.260
And that is relevant, how?

32:50.660 --> 32:52.260
It's in Kim's best interests.

32:53.020 --> 32:56.220
Oh, and the police came by and picked
up that contraband from the laundry.

32:56.300 --> 32:57.780
Thanks for the tip off.

32:58.700 --> 33:00.580
- No worries.
- Keep up the good work.

33:15.060 --> 33:17.300
You're going to be in the
sun, get a little bit of air

33:17.380 --> 33:19.140
and that'll make you feel nice.

33:19.220 --> 33:20.660
Hey!

33:21.300 --> 33:23.980
- You really freaked us out yesterday.
- Yeah.

33:24.060 --> 33:25.460
But you're all right now, aren't you?

33:25.540 --> 33:27.620
'Cause you've gotten
through the worst of it, hey?

33:27.700 --> 33:29.660
What do you think of the flower boxes, Bea?

33:29.740 --> 33:30.820
- They're looking great, eh?
- Yeah.

33:30.900 --> 33:32.980
Dor's got me into the
gardening, haven't you, darling?

33:33.060 --> 33:35.500
Yeah. Oh, I planted the roses for you.

33:36.820 --> 33:37.820
And for Deb.

33:38.340 --> 33:39.620
They're pretty.

33:40.100 --> 33:42.860
Yeah, look at these ones. You've
got the pansies down the front here.

33:42.940 --> 33:46.140
They're little purple. They're beautiful.
And these ones are the geraniums.

33:46.220 --> 33:49.100
And daisies at the back,
'cause they're nice and bright.

33:49.220 --> 33:51.460
Reckon these ones are coming along, too.

33:54.060 --> 33:55.900
Look at that one. Can you see?

33:56.140 --> 33:57.420
Good morning.

33:58.260 --> 33:59.380
Hi.

34:01.300 --> 34:03.380
I'm Ms. Ferguson, the new Governor.

34:03.460 --> 34:05.420
I don't think we've
been properly introduced.

34:05.980 --> 34:06.980
Bea Smith.

34:07.300 --> 34:09.340
Yes. I've heard all about you.

34:10.020 --> 34:12.020
I didn't want to keep you
cooped up in isolation.

34:12.100 --> 34:14.820
I think you can achieve much more out here.

34:16.179 --> 34:18.060
How are you feeling this morning?

34:18.739 --> 34:21.060
- Better, thanks.
- Yeah, we're looking after her.

34:21.139 --> 34:23.179
I haven't forgotten about you,
Doreen, we'll catch up soon.

34:23.739 --> 34:25.100
Right. Okay.

34:28.820 --> 34:30.260
I think she might like you, Dor.

34:30.699 --> 34:31.980
Whatever.

34:32.780 --> 34:35.780
Franky, you've got to move that phone.

34:35.860 --> 34:38.300
- I nearly got sprung.
- What'd you do with it?

34:38.380 --> 34:39.620
Nothing.

34:39.820 --> 34:41.540
Well, make sure it stays that way.

34:50.980 --> 34:53.100
It's changed. Everything's changed.

34:54.580 --> 34:56.060
You got a problem, Red?

34:59.060 --> 35:00.260
Attention, compound.

35:00.340 --> 35:02.380
H-Block proceed to work units.

35:02.660 --> 35:05.140
- H-Block to work units.
- Gonna go in?

35:05.220 --> 35:06.340
Let's go.

35:12.740 --> 35:15.140
Booms. Who does this remind you of?

35:15.860 --> 35:18.020
Jacqueline!

35:18.860 --> 35:21.860
- You guessed it.
- Oh, yeah, I know.

35:22.700 --> 35:24.180
Man overboard.

35:32.180 --> 35:33.300
You missing us, are ya?

35:34.860 --> 35:36.820
I need you to get me some sedatives.

35:38.100 --> 35:39.140
What for?

35:40.380 --> 35:41.580
Because I like them.

35:43.020 --> 35:45.660
- You knock yourself out?
- Yeah.

35:47.060 --> 35:48.100
Works for me.

35:49.060 --> 35:50.100
It'll cost ya.

35:51.060 --> 35:52.300
How soon can you get 'em?

35:53.340 --> 35:56.100
Bea? You're on light duties.
You're not supposed to be in here.

35:56.380 --> 35:57.420
Leave it with me.

36:02.060 --> 36:03.340
You all right?

36:03.700 --> 36:06.060
Hey, Booms, take over for a sec.

36:06.140 --> 36:07.460
Awesome!

36:14.980 --> 36:16.340
How's that bank balance, Miss Miles?

36:17.580 --> 36:20.340
No, Franky. That was a one off. That's it.

36:20.540 --> 36:22.380
Well, we could make it a
regular deal if you want.

36:24.140 --> 36:26.020
- Did you get rid of it?
- Maybe.

36:26.620 --> 36:27.700
I want that phone gone.

36:28.100 --> 36:29.780
It's nearly flat anyway.

36:31.700 --> 36:33.820
I need some sedatives, soon as possible.

36:35.780 --> 36:36.820
Get back to work.

36:37.820 --> 36:39.020
Okay.

36:42.340 --> 36:44.740
- Don't keep messing up my vibe.
- What?

36:44.820 --> 36:46.700
- Go get rid of the phone.
- Where is it?

36:47.700 --> 36:48.780
Planter boxes.

36:55.900 --> 36:56.980
You owe me.

37:00.180 --> 37:01.180
Lizzie.

37:15.660 --> 37:16.940
What are you doing?

37:17.020 --> 37:19.300
You are not going to
spend your life spaced out.

37:19.380 --> 37:20.620
You give those to me.

37:20.700 --> 37:23.140
Will you just leave me alone?
I want to be with my daughter.

37:24.460 --> 37:25.900
Your daughter's dead.

37:27.580 --> 37:28.740
No, she's not.

37:30.380 --> 37:33.260
I can see her and I talk to her.

37:33.740 --> 37:37.220
Oh, darling, that is just
the drugs. It's not real.

37:37.300 --> 37:39.340
- Brayden Holt killed her.
- No, no.

37:39.420 --> 37:41.220
- Now, you remember Brayden, don't ya?
- No.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.940
Look, that's him there,
darling. You look at that.

37:43.020 --> 37:45.420
That is Brayden Holt, Jacs' son.

37:45.500 --> 37:47.780
Now he stuck a needle in Deb's arm

37:47.860 --> 37:49.940
- and he ended her life.
- No.

37:50.020 --> 37:52.180
And I am sorry that that
happened to you, Bea.

37:52.260 --> 37:53.700
- No.
- But she is gone.

37:53.780 --> 37:55.020
Don't ruin this for me.

37:55.100 --> 37:57.140
- Don't ruin this for me.
- Hey, listen. Listen.

37:57.900 --> 38:00.740
No, you listen to me. You
listen to me, you look at me.

38:03.900 --> 38:06.060
Now you, you are stronger than this.

38:07.260 --> 38:09.940
- You have survived...
- You think I give a fuck?

38:14.020 --> 38:17.140
I am stuck in here with nothing.

38:22.900 --> 38:26.460
Then you take it one day at a time,

38:27.020 --> 38:29.380
and you find a reason to get up tomorrow.

38:31.460 --> 38:33.100
Any reason, Bea.

38:35.060 --> 38:36.740
Just find one.

38:39.940 --> 38:41.180
You can do it.

38:44.180 --> 38:45.540
I know you can.

39:08.574 --> 39:09.814
Hello, Doreen.

39:12.814 --> 39:16.094
Uh... You wanted to see me?

39:17.534 --> 39:20.454
Yes. Come on over.

39:35.094 --> 39:36.414
It's terrible, isn't it?

39:38.454 --> 39:39.854
All your hard work ruined.

39:44.694 --> 39:45.934
And for what?

39:57.694 --> 40:00.334
Still, all is not lost.

40:02.894 --> 40:04.374
Where there's life.

40:10.054 --> 40:13.214
I checked the surveillance cameras,
so we know who's responsible.

40:13.854 --> 40:16.294
Seems this was the hiding
place for some contraband.

40:16.854 --> 40:18.534
I wouldn't know anything about that.

40:19.574 --> 40:21.054
I'm very glad to hear that.

40:22.614 --> 40:26.174
Rochelle is a moll, Daz.

40:26.454 --> 40:29.534
Why would you want to be with her?

40:32.294 --> 40:34.014
I know.

40:36.014 --> 40:37.454
Yeah, I know.

40:38.214 --> 40:41.174
You know she's been with every
bloke in Frankston, don't ya?

40:42.294 --> 40:43.974
You know what they call her?

40:44.454 --> 40:45.734
The Cum Dumpster.

40:50.574 --> 40:52.254
I have to go now.

40:55.854 --> 40:58.134
She'll be slotted, but it
won't undo what she's done.

40:58.614 --> 41:00.974
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you.

41:01.574 --> 41:03.414
I've done it once. I can do it again.

41:04.294 --> 41:05.454
Good attitude.

41:07.214 --> 41:09.214
But I think we can go one better.

41:12.654 --> 41:15.494
This yard has been neglected
for a very long time.

41:15.574 --> 41:18.454
How would you feel about turning
it into a proper vegetable garden?

41:19.134 --> 41:20.854
Something to keep the
women focused and occupied?

41:24.174 --> 41:25.494
Do you think you can do it?

41:27.574 --> 41:29.574
Yeah. When... When can we start?

42:12.854 --> 42:15.054
Oh, it's beautiful.

42:15.294 --> 42:19.374
You're beautiful. You are so beautiful.

42:19.454 --> 42:20.574
Thanks, Mum.

42:26.414 --> 42:27.534
You won't listen to them, will you?

42:28.334 --> 42:29.654
You won't leave me?

42:30.494 --> 42:31.654
Darling...

42:33.134 --> 42:34.414
They're right.

42:35.294 --> 42:37.334
I can't stay here forever.

42:39.774 --> 42:40.934
I have to go now.

42:41.814 --> 42:43.854
But you've got everything you wanted.

42:45.094 --> 42:47.134
- We're together now.
- Mmm-hmm.

42:48.254 --> 42:50.814
It's okay. You're gonna be all right.

42:54.134 --> 42:57.294
Everything is gonna be okay.

43:01.214 --> 43:02.734
My date's here.

43:04.574 --> 43:05.734
Do you wanna meet him?

43:08.014 --> 43:09.054
Yeah.

43:12.694 --> 43:14.814
Hey, please don't cry.

43:15.774 --> 43:17.454
No, no, don't cry, please.

43:20.254 --> 43:21.574
I've got a reason.
