00:00.400 --> 00:02.830
Alan, I need to talk to you.

00:02.840 --> 00:03.780
Okay.

00:03.790 --> 00:04.880
Alone.

00:04.890 --> 00:07.370
Gotta be about sex.

00:07.380 --> 00:08.650
Take a hike.

00:08.660 --> 00:09.640
You know, I'm 14.

00:09.650 --> 00:11.850
- You're not protecting me anymore.
- Jake.

00:12.160 --> 00:15.060
This is just a pathetic sham.

00:16.239 --> 00:17.770
So what's up?

00:17.780 --> 00:21.360
Okay. Long story short, I've
got a young woman upstairs.

00:21.820 --> 00:24.390
I didn't see this one coming.

00:24.880 --> 00:25.820
See her?

00:25.830 --> 00:28.300
I'm surprised you couldn't hear her.

00:28.310 --> 00:31.240
She was like a cat in a fan belt.

00:32.740 --> 00:35.020
Anyway...

00:35.030 --> 00:37.040
I need you to entertain
her in my absence.

00:37.050 --> 00:38.810
Entertain her? What'd you have in mind?

00:38.820 --> 00:41.610
A musical number from sweeney todd?

00:42.130 --> 00:43.130
How young is she?

00:43.140 --> 00:45.650
Maybe a little
peek-a-boo.

00:46.310 --> 00:49.360
Right there. That's
why no one likes you.

00:50.740 --> 00:52.780
Just keep her occupied till I get back.

00:52.790 --> 00:53.800
Where you going?

00:53.810 --> 00:55.580
I have a date.

00:56.210 --> 00:58.530
A date? I-it's 8:30 in the morning.

00:58.540 --> 00:59.450
I know what time it is.

00:59.460 --> 01:03.310
I have a limited window of opportunity
here her husband's playing nine holes,

01:03.330 --> 01:07.140
so I thought as long as he's out,
I'd try to play a couple myself.

01:07.910 --> 01:10.830
Then why don't you send
the other girl home?

01:10.840 --> 01:11.830
I'll be back by noon.

01:11.840 --> 01:14.750
What am I supposed to
do the rest of the day?

01:15.370 --> 01:17.930
Okay, okay. I mean...

01:17.940 --> 01:21.420
I'm gonna say something now because,
well, I think it needs to be said.

01:21.430 --> 01:22.050
What?

01:22.060 --> 01:25.310
You're a severely damaged human being.

01:25.920 --> 01:30.340
I'd love to stay and chitchat with you, but
I've got a golf widow marinating in brentwood.

01:30.350 --> 01:31.570
Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait.

01:31.580 --> 01:33.350
Wh-what am I supposed to
tell the girl upstairs?

01:33.380 --> 01:35.930
I don't know. Tell her
I went out to give blood.

01:35.940 --> 01:39.090
That way, if I come back a little
weak, I've got a good excuse.

01:41.180 --> 01:42.990
So, you want me to just lie to her.

01:43.000 --> 01:43.870
Well, it's up to you.

01:43.880 --> 01:45.190
You could tell her the truth,

01:45.200 --> 01:49.160
but then you'd have to pack up all your
crap and move into the lifeguard station.

01:50.320 --> 01:51.690
why you gotta do that?

01:51.700 --> 01:53.750
Why is it always "my
way or the highway"?

01:53.760 --> 01:55.800
"Obey my commands, or
you're out of the house."

01:55.810 --> 01:58.740
Then again, if the system
works, why mess with it?

02:00.000 --> 02:06.074

02:25.310 --> 02:30.130
boy, they left the faucet on a long
time when they poured those legs.

02:31.320 --> 02:34.520
I don't believe it. Another one.

02:36.910 --> 02:38.110
Hey, Alan.

02:38.120 --> 02:39.570
Who's the blonde?

02:39.580 --> 02:42.570
Don't know. Found her on the beach.

02:42.580 --> 02:44.540
Like--
homeless?

02:44.550 --> 02:46.580
Not tonight.

02:46.590 --> 02:49.110
You realize, that's three in one day.

02:49.120 --> 02:50.630
Depends how you count.

02:50.640 --> 02:53.920
I make it out to be... seven.

02:54.450 --> 02:56.020
Or eight.

02:56.030 --> 02:58.260
I should carry a clicker.

03:00.400 --> 03:03.510
Charlie, even for you,
this is ridiculous.

03:03.520 --> 03:07.300
One man's ridiculous is
another man's yabba-dabba-doo.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.310
"I should carry a clicker."

03:12.320 --> 03:14.640
"Yabba-dabba-doo."

03:14.650 --> 03:16.820
By the way, I'm charlie.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.470
I'm gretchen.

03:18.480 --> 03:19.950
Ooh, I like that. Gretchen.

03:19.960 --> 03:22.690
It's got a built-in grrr.

03:25.270 --> 03:26.950
upstairs on the right.

03:26.970 --> 03:29.370
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Okay.

03:37.320 --> 03:39.570
- Charlie harper?
- Yeah.

03:41.260 --> 03:43.850
Keep your hands off my wife.

03:43.860 --> 03:46.310
Yes, sir. No problem.

03:46.320 --> 03:49.250
Oh, god. Charlie? Are you okay?

03:49.260 --> 03:51.150
No, I'm not okay.

03:51.180 --> 03:54.150
I just got punched in the face.

03:54.910 --> 03:57.410
Help me up.

03:57.420 --> 03:59.490
That was an angry husband, wasn't it?

03:59.500 --> 04:01.450
Well, you can't really blame him.

04:01.460 --> 04:05.110
From now on, he's gonna have to
take his wife golfing with him.

04:07.930 --> 04:09.270
Wait a second.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.660
You're still going upstairs?

04:10.670 --> 04:14.140
Why not? It wasn't her husband.

04:15.410 --> 04:18.110
But... you're bleeding.

04:18.120 --> 04:20.190
Did you see that girl?

04:20.200 --> 04:23.980
I'd be climbing these stairs if
I was just a head and a spine.

04:28.310 --> 04:31.150
Berta, have you noticed anything
different about charlie lately?

04:31.160 --> 04:32.210
What do you mean?

04:32.220 --> 04:34.340
Well, he's always been
promiscuous, but...

04:34.350 --> 04:37.270
I'm starting to think I
should hide my bowling ball.

04:38.430 --> 04:39.810
I know what you're saying.

04:39.820 --> 04:44.020
I'm having to change his sheets so often,
I'm thinking about putting them on a roller.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.410
Ha-have you ever seen
him act this way before?

04:49.420 --> 04:50.820
Well...

04:50.830 --> 04:54.180
when viagra first came out,
I thought he was gonna die.

04:55.830 --> 05:00.490
You know how they say if your erection lasts
more than four hours, you should call your doctor?

05:00.500 --> 05:03.010
He'd just call another girl.

05:03.300 --> 05:04.300
Yipes.

05:04.310 --> 05:08.410
For a while there, he had to
stand on his head to take a leak.

05:16.710 --> 05:18.760
- Morning.
- morning.

05:22.430 --> 05:25.350
Rough night in hump junction?

05:26.450 --> 05:28.690
No, I was good.

05:28.890 --> 05:31.770
I just had a little accident.

05:32.390 --> 05:35.780
I tried to pick my lady friend
up and put her on the bureau

05:35.790 --> 05:40.390
and now I can't find
one of my testicles.

05:41.430 --> 05:43.870
Oh, charlie.

05:43.880 --> 05:46.760
I don't think I really lost it.

05:46.770 --> 05:48.510
It's kind of like your keys.

05:48.520 --> 05:52.660
Even if you can't put your hands on
them, you know they gotta be somewhere.

05:57.430 --> 06:01.370
That is something you do not
want to find in the vacuum bag.

06:04.850 --> 06:07.060
You know, I'm really
starting to worry about him.

06:07.070 --> 06:09.330
I-I feel like I should do something.

06:09.340 --> 06:14.920
The way he's been acting, if I were you, I'd
start sleeping on my back wearing a catcher's mask.

06:17.140 --> 06:20.320
Charlie: Good news! I found it!

06:22.410 --> 06:25.370
It's always the last place you look.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.210
Are you sure you're up to this?

06:32.220 --> 06:34.190
I'm fine.

06:40.260 --> 06:43.810
Just a little tender in the giblets.

06:50.780 --> 06:53.340
Yeah. You're fine.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.570
Two beers, please.

06:57.930 --> 07:00.620
Oh, yeah. Much better.

07:07.180 --> 07:09.540
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

07:09.550 --> 07:11.760
I'm scouting the talent.

07:11.770 --> 07:13.980
Are you out of your mind?

07:13.990 --> 07:15.270
What's your pickup line?

07:15.280 --> 07:18.770
"You want to come back to my place
and help me look for my balls?"

07:19.190 --> 07:22.650
It was one ball, and I found it.

07:22.660 --> 07:25.960
Oh, charlie. Don't you think
you need to slow down a bit?

07:25.970 --> 07:27.380
Why would I want to do that?

07:27.390 --> 07:31.580
Well, come on. Is, is this
lifestyle actually making you happy?

07:32.570 --> 07:34.930
Let me answer that question
with another question.

07:34.940 --> 07:38.020
Who would you rather be? You? Or me?

07:38.030 --> 07:39.650
You're kidding, right?

07:39.660 --> 07:43.840
You have two black eyes and
you're perched on a scrotum cozy.

07:45.560 --> 07:47.940
You.

07:52.970 --> 07:55.740
- Hey, there.
- Oh, sweet lord.

07:55.750 --> 07:57.910
Can I buy you a drink?

07:58.090 --> 07:59.950
If you want to.

07:59.960 --> 08:03.930
Well, I'd like to buy you an
airplane, but let's start with a drink.

08:03.940 --> 08:05.880
- I'm charlie.
- Pepper.

08:06.340 --> 08:07.740
My favorite condiment.

08:07.750 --> 08:10.170
- It's a spice.
- Shut up.

08:11.220 --> 08:13.710
So, charlie.

08:18.590 --> 08:22.160
No kidding. Well, then...

08:26.480 --> 08:28.590
all right. You're under
arrest for solicitation.

08:28.600 --> 08:32.580
Stand up, put your hands behind
your back, and spread your legs.

08:33.480 --> 08:37.120
I'm afraid you're going
to have to choose one.

08:40.429 --> 08:42.690
Now will you admit you've got a problem?

08:42.700 --> 08:45.140
That was entrapment.

08:45.150 --> 08:46.790
I'm the victim here.

08:46.800 --> 08:50.340
If she wasn't a cop, what did you
think you were gonna do with her?

08:51.740 --> 08:53.620
I really don't know.

08:53.630 --> 08:55.870
Charlie, don't you see
what's happening to you?

08:55.880 --> 09:01.020
Nothing's happening, except i offered
to buy a policewoman a $500 martini.

09:01.460 --> 09:04.220
Well, then, I guess there's no
point in my talking to you anymore.

09:04.230 --> 09:07.720
All right. Then something
good came of this.

09:23.400 --> 09:26.210
keep your hands off my girlfriend!

09:26.220 --> 09:29.390
You're gonna have to be more specific.

09:30.730 --> 09:33.310
Son of a bitch.

09:35.810 --> 09:39.260
's been going on?

09:43.140 --> 09:45.360
Well...

09:45.830 --> 09:48.030
I've got a new career.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.760
As a crash test dummy?

09:52.720 --> 09:55.390
- Writing songs for little kids.
- Really?

09:55.400 --> 09:59.660
Yeah. Turns out, immature
minds respond to me.

10:00.060 --> 10:02.460
That sounds about right.

10:03.710 --> 10:05.810
Uh, let's see. What else?

10:05.820 --> 10:07.690
my mom's getting married. Nice guy.

10:07.700 --> 10:08.640
Good for her.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.930
Yeah. Yeah. My brother
still lives with me.

10:10.940 --> 10:13.920
Sure. We knew he wasn't going anywhere.

10:16.240 --> 10:19.970
let's see, um... my
nephew's growing like a weed.

10:19.980 --> 10:23.370
Mack's fianc? is getting married. I've
been dating a lot. Nothing serious.

10:23.380 --> 10:28.100
And, as you can see, I've
had a couple of... mishaps.

10:28.550 --> 10:34.120
Well, except for the facial lacerations
and the rectal doughnut, hardly noticeable.

10:34.130 --> 10:37.800
It's actually a testicular doughnut.

10:37.810 --> 10:39.260
What's the difference?

10:39.270 --> 10:41.500
About that much.

10:43.330 --> 10:46.100
Well, that's disturbing.

10:47.630 --> 10:50.590
let's circle back to the
ex-fianc? What was her name?

10:50.600 --> 10:51.600
Mia.

10:51.610 --> 10:56.470
Mia. How do you feel about mia getting
married and moving on with her life?

10:56.800 --> 10:58.900
I feel fine about it. I'm happy for her.

10:58.910 --> 11:02.000
No remorse? No regrets?

11:02.010 --> 11:04.330
Not really. It's been a long time.

11:04.340 --> 11:08.940
Okay. So when did you learn
about her upcoming nuptials?

11:09.840 --> 11:13.360
I don't know. A couple of weeks ago.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.150
Yep. Two weeks.

11:17.160 --> 11:20.020
You're carrying the
announcement around with you?

11:20.030 --> 11:22.500
- Yeah. Why?
- No reason.

11:23.990 --> 11:26.240
And you say you've been dating a lot?

11:26.250 --> 11:28.110
A little more than usual.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.840
And when did that new pattern start?

11:30.850 --> 11:34.550
Gee. I don't know. It's got
to be a couple of weeks now.

11:37.510 --> 11:38.810
- What?
- Aw, come on, charlie.

11:38.820 --> 11:42.570
Just 'cause I get paid by the hour
doesn't mean this should take forever.

11:44.970 --> 11:48.900
It's pretty clear that the news about
this woman getting married has hurt you,

11:48.910 --> 11:51.750
and you're acting out.

11:51.760 --> 11:56.000
Man, you shrinks want to bring
everything back to feelings, don't you?

11:56.010 --> 11:58.980
You think it has anything to
do with your toilet training?

11:58.990 --> 11:59.940
No.

11:59.950 --> 12:02.900
Well, then I guess we're
stuck with feelings.

12:03.090 --> 12:06.610
Now, when you read that
announcement, how did you feel?

12:07.160 --> 12:08.860
I don't know.

12:08.870 --> 12:12.950
How you feel when the woman you were once in
love with is getting married to another guy.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.050
Describe it.

12:15.060 --> 12:16.180
Describe it?

12:16.190 --> 12:18.310
Just for fun.

12:20.120 --> 12:24.190
It's hard to say exactly. I...

12:24.200 --> 12:28.800
I guess it's kind of like a, a, a
trapdoor opens up under your feet, and...

12:28.810 --> 12:31.020
and... and you're falling.

12:31.030 --> 12:35.340
And, at the same time, there's this
enormous pressure on your chest, like A...

12:35.350 --> 12:40.580
like a big animal-- maybe a possum
or a raccoon-- is sitting on it...

12:42.240 --> 12:44.440
and you can't catch your breath.

12:44.450 --> 12:48.010
"A possum or a raccoon."

12:48.020 --> 12:50.970
- If you're writing it down, say "raccoon."
- Will do.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.830
I don't know why I said possum.

12:55.150 --> 12:56.350
It's okay.

12:56.820 --> 13:00.690
you think it's possible
that this feeling of falling,

13:00.700 --> 13:06.540
and the raccoon on your chest, is a
physical manifestation of unexpressed grief?

13:06.550 --> 13:07.430
Grief?

13:07.450 --> 13:08.950
You know. Sadness.

13:08.960 --> 13:11.280
How do you read sadness into that?

13:11.290 --> 13:14.950
Look, charlie, you're a
smart guy. Emotionally?

13:16.830 --> 13:18.700
but you gotta see what's going on here.

13:18.720 --> 13:22.750
You're using this series of
meaningless sexual liaisons

13:22.760 --> 13:27.110
to run away from your feelings
about losing this woman.

13:27.120 --> 13:31.390
No. No. I'm sorry. I don't
see it. Let's keep looking.

13:31.400 --> 13:34.470
What about my mom getting married?
That can upset a fella. Right?

13:34.480 --> 13:38.030
Make him go all ancient
greek and poke his eyes out.

13:39.050 --> 13:39.890
Oh, come on, charlie.

13:39.900 --> 13:43.130
You loved this woman, and
I'd say you still love her.

13:43.140 --> 13:46.790
And, deep down, maybe you were hoping
someday you'd get back together.

13:46.800 --> 13:52.910
And the only reason you're not sitting here
weeping is because it's too painful for you.

13:55.840 --> 13:58.930
I'm sorry. I... I...
I just can't see it.

13:58.940 --> 14:02.850
You can't see it because
your penis is in the way.

14:05.650 --> 14:07.830
Thank you.

14:08.830 --> 14:11.390
It's not a compliment, charlie.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.450
Says you.

14:15.710 --> 14:18.700
Look, you-you have a
very simple choice here.

14:18.710 --> 14:23.340
You can honestly confront these emotions
and learn the lessons they bring,

14:23.350 --> 14:28.340
or you can drive yourself into an
early grave with indiscriminate sex.

14:31.410 --> 14:34.170
Define "early."

14:53.830 --> 14:55.950
what are you doing?

14:55.960 --> 14:58.990
Trying to feel my feelings.

15:00.880 --> 15:03.660
Really. How's it going?

15:03.670 --> 15:06.060
Not well.

15:12.380 --> 15:14.780
see? Nothing. No grief.

15:14.790 --> 15:17.090
What exactly are you
trying to grieve over?

15:17.100 --> 15:19.320
Well, mia's getting married.

15:19.350 --> 15:22.010
Wait, wait, wait. Mia? The
one you were going to marry?

15:22.020 --> 15:26.750
Yeah. And my shrink thinks
I'm pretty upset about it.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.350
Do you think you're upset about it?

15:29.360 --> 15:32.420
I don't know. I really did love her.

15:32.430 --> 15:35.100
- I know you did.
- Yeah.

15:36.110 --> 15:41.230
I remember, this one time, we were driving
to santa barbara for the weekend, and...

15:41.630 --> 15:46.480
she just smiled at
me, and I thought, man,

15:46.490 --> 15:50.270
I could spend the rest of my
life with this woman. No problem.

15:51.520 --> 15:56.530
And then... then I... I lost her.

15:56.790 --> 16:00.190
And I... I don'T... I don't think I'm
going to find anybody like her again.

16:00.200 --> 16:03.060
What the hell is going on, Alan?

16:03.070 --> 16:04.250
This is good. This is good. You're...

16:04.260 --> 16:06.080
you're finally starting
to feel your grief.

16:06.090 --> 16:11.000
And, and once you really feel it and accept
it, you can get on with your life without mia.

16:11.010 --> 16:11.540
Really?

16:11.560 --> 16:14.910
Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead. Let it out.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.970
no. This is crap.

16:23.170 --> 16:25.090
Where you going?

16:25.100 --> 16:27.590
I just realized, I won't
have to feel my feelings,

16:27.600 --> 16:30.780
and live without mia if
I just go get her back.

16:30.790 --> 16:31.980
That's your solution?

16:32.000 --> 16:34.820
Yeah. "Duh," right?

16:36.240 --> 16:39.200
"Duh," indeed.

16:42.950 --> 16:45.660
Forgot my doughnut.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.380
You laugh, but it really does help.

16:53.980 --> 16:57.230
Bride? Seen the bride?

16:57.240 --> 16:59.080
Got a delivery for the bride.

16:59.090 --> 17:00.230
I think she's in there.

17:00.240 --> 17:03.860
Thanks. There you go.

17:15.470 --> 17:18.390
Charlie! What are you doing here?

17:18.400 --> 17:20.180
I came to get you back.

17:20.190 --> 17:22.500
Are you out of your mind?

17:22.510 --> 17:25.970
No, no. I got the idea from my shrink.

17:26.810 --> 17:29.830
Could you ladies give us a minute?

17:30.560 --> 17:34.710
- Okay. One minute.
- Thanks.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.290
How are you? Looking good.

17:37.300 --> 17:39.930
Don't worry. Your big day will come.

17:42.440 --> 17:44.890
Charlie, I'm getting married in an hour.

17:44.900 --> 17:45.900
So I'm not too late.

17:45.910 --> 17:47.790
Oh, you are so too late.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.410
Just hear me out.

17:49.420 --> 17:51.350
My god! What happened to you?

17:51.360 --> 17:52.400
No big deal.

17:52.410 --> 17:55.610
I just yanked a kid out of
the way of a speeding bus.

17:55.620 --> 17:58.730
Got clipped by the side mirror.

17:58.740 --> 18:01.170
Okay, that's a bunch of crap.

18:01.180 --> 18:03.010
But this is the truth.

18:03.020 --> 18:08.110
Mia, I have never felt about
any woman like I feel about you,

18:08.120 --> 18:10.630
and the thought of you
marrying some other guy is...

18:10.640 --> 18:12.650
it's breaking my heart.

18:12.670 --> 18:16.670
So, I'm just going for broke here.

18:20.030 --> 18:21.930
Mia, I love you.

18:21.940 --> 18:25.540
I will always love you,
and I want you to marry me.

18:25.900 --> 18:29.420
Honey, the photographer wants to, uh...

18:29.430 --> 18:30.480
what's going on?

18:30.490 --> 18:34.000
Daddy, I told you about
charlie harper. Remember?

18:34.010 --> 18:36.150
Oh, good. I'm glad you're here, sir.

18:36.160 --> 18:39.030
I'd like to ask you
for your daughter'S...

18:45.020 --> 18:47.700
how much did you tell him?

18:56.380 --> 18:58.270
Thanks.

18:58.280 --> 19:01.790
- You, uh, need some more ice for your jaw?
- No.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.320
- Your nose?
- Nah.

19:03.330 --> 19:05.610
How about the chestnuts?

19:06.200 --> 19:07.880
Resting comfortably, thanks.

19:07.890 --> 19:11.170
Okay. Well, uh... try to get some sleep.

19:13.050 --> 19:15.110
- Alan?
- Yeah?

19:15.120 --> 19:17.110
I learned something about myself.

19:17.120 --> 19:19.300
That you're a bleeder?

19:19.910 --> 19:23.020
I learned why I screw around so much.

19:23.030 --> 19:25.280
- Really?
- Yep.

19:25.960 --> 19:31.360
I think I've spent my whole life trying to
fill the empty space in myself by, you know...

19:32.700 --> 19:35.670
filling the empty space in others?

19:35.680 --> 19:37.340
Exactly.

19:37.350 --> 19:39.090
That's quite an insight.

19:39.100 --> 19:41.980
Well, I'm deep in therapy now.

19:41.990 --> 19:43.970
You went for one hour, charlie.

19:43.980 --> 19:47.510
50 minutes. It's kind of a racket.

19:48.140 --> 19:52.080
But the point is, I've hit bottom.

19:52.090 --> 19:54.420
I can't keep going like this.

19:54.440 --> 19:56.020
It's time for me to grow up.

19:56.030 --> 19:58.340
I agree. So, uh...

19:58.650 --> 20:00.510
what are you going to do?

20:00.520 --> 20:05.890
Well, I thought I'd find some chick with
a big heart and a tiny ass and marry her.

20:07.420 --> 20:10.730
Maybe that girl from the
beach. She seemed nice.

20:11.360 --> 20:13.400
- You're going to get married?
- Yep.

20:13.410 --> 20:18.290
Settle down, have a couple of kids,
and ship the penis up to cooperstown.

20:18.990 --> 20:20.720
Cooperstown?

20:20.730 --> 20:23.010
It is my bat.

20:23.480 --> 20:26.780
Well, sounds like you've
got everything figured out.

20:26.790 --> 20:29.760
You don't ever figure
this stuff out, Alan.

20:29.780 --> 20:35.400
You just take little baby steps on a
lifelong path to becoming a better man.

20:36.940 --> 20:40.640
- How many pain pills have you taken?
- Nine.

20:42.220 --> 20:44.410
Good night.

20:45.830 --> 20:50.270
Might not be a bad idea to check on me in
an hour or so, make sure I'm still breathing.

20:50.280 --> 20:52.260
I always do.

21:05.700 --> 21:07.640
mia.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.200
My balls!
