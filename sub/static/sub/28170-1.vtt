How big?

02:22.098 --> 02:23.839
Happy birthday, darling.

That's a big piece.

Someone's gonna be up all night.

How are you doing over

This is the Department
of Water and Power.

05:09.570 --> 05:15.097
This is our final
attempt to contact
Steven James Harrison.

05:15.140 --> 05:19.188
If we do not receive payment
by midnight tonight,

05:19.231 --> 05:21.451
the power will be disconnected.

Harrison.

07:01.508 --> 07:03.945
You've got to take better
care of yourself, Stevie.

07:06.295 --> 07:08.515
You only get one life.

07:09.733 --> 07:11.169
Don't waste it like I did.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.785
Well, spit.

09:18.514 --> 09:20.560
Don't you want any sauce?

09:24.738 --> 09:26.043
Hey there, Tiger.

09:27.436 --> 09:29.090
What a party, huh?

09:29.133 --> 09:30.221
Mm-hm

09:31.614 --> 09:33.616
It was a really big show.

09:33.660 --> 09:34.878
Don't you think, Mom?

09:34.922 --> 09:35.966
Mm.

09:46.977 --> 09:48.762
He can't drive himself?

09:48.805 --> 09:50.154
His car wouldn't start.

09:50.198 --> 09:51.242
Took long enough.

09:53.027 --> 09:54.898
-It was traffic.
-Hmm.

09:54.942 --> 09:56.596
He certainly had enough
to drink tonight.

09:56.639 --> 09:58.641
Oh, for Christ's sakes,
it's Christmas Eve.

09:58.685 --> 09:59.773
Don't start!

09:59.816 --> 10:01.339
So, he was having
a little bit of fun.

10:01.383 --> 10:02.819
-You too.
-So, shoot me!

10:07.955 --> 10:08.999
You forgot one.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.657
-It's my sister.
-Dried fruit?

10:14.701 --> 10:16.180
Well, I--

10:16.224 --> 10:18.182
It's for
the bomb shelter, I suppose.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.272
I'll put it by my dad's gift.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.667
The fruit with the gun.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.847
Oh, Stevie, sweetheart.

10:30.891 --> 10:32.762
No, no, no, that's bad luck!

10:32.806 --> 10:35.417
Quick. Very quickly throw it
over your shoulder.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.158
-Why?
-Superstition.

10:37.201 --> 10:39.377
No, they say the devil waits
over your shoulder,

10:39.421 --> 10:42.076
-so you want
to throw salt into his eyes.
-They also say that Judas

10:42.119 --> 10:44.687
spilled salt all over
the table at the last super.

10:44.731 --> 10:46.471
-Oh Judas.
-Oh Judas.

10:46.515 --> 10:48.386
-Oh Judas!
-Oh Judas!

11:09.320 --> 11:11.714
Most destructive bubble
in the history of human-

11:11.758 --> 11:15.326
itching, or swelling,
trouble breathing,
rash, hives, blisters,

11:15.370 --> 11:18.982
mood changes,
slurred speech, blurry vision,
dizziness, weakness,

11:19.026 --> 11:21.071
weight gain, irritability
and confusion.

11:21.115 --> 11:22.943
Swelling of the legs,
hands and feet.

11:22.986 --> 11:25.554
Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting
and kidney failure.

11:25.597 --> 11:28.992
Call your doctor if you
experience a persistent cough,
pain with fever.

11:29.036 --> 11:32.996
A lump or swelling in your neck. Don't take alcohol or drugs
or operate machinery.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.911
Those who have had
a drug or alcohol problem

11:34.955 --> 11:37.305
are more likely
to become dependent.

11:37.348 --> 11:39.916
Now, my toenail fungus is gone. And I can go barefoot again!

11:39.960 --> 11:42.745
Speak with a professional before starting a new drug program.

11:42.789 --> 11:46.009

about my beautiful smile.

11:50.405 --> 11:52.102

are here to help you.

11:52.146 --> 11:53.974
They told me my pearly
whites would be--

13:13.880 --> 13:14.924
I'm not here.

13:16.143 --> 13:17.361
Stevie?

13:18.319 --> 13:19.363
It's Mom...

13:22.105 --> 13:23.890
I have some bad news, honey.

13:24.891 --> 13:26.501
Karen passed away this morning.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.026
I didn't know if you knew.

13:32.202 --> 13:33.595
She never remarried.

13:36.163 --> 13:37.512
I love you, Stevie.

13:37.555 --> 13:39.035
I wish you would call.

13:41.081 --> 13:43.257
Happy 60th birthday.

13:44.911 --> 13:45.955
Time flies.

14:28.737 --> 14:31.435
Are those who believe that
if you move a grain of sand,

14:31.479 --> 14:36.049
you start down a new path,
and everything
before is changed.

14:36.092 --> 14:40.357
There are also those who believe that love can change the future

14:40.401 --> 14:44.535
if it is strong enough
and selfless enough.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.895
Final attempt to contact Steve!

14:56.939 --> 14:58.506
Power will be disconnect--

15:00.073 --> 15:01.552
...passed away this morning.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.046
I am Steve.

15:17.090 --> 15:18.918
And this is Adam.

15:18.961 --> 15:21.007
Very excited to be here tonight.
It's a wonderful crowd.

15:21.050 --> 15:23.052
A lot of faces I recognize.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.621
Professor Ellison,
thank you for the incomplete.

15:26.664 --> 15:28.101
Thank you, sir.

15:28.144 --> 15:29.145
You look great tonight.

15:31.452 --> 15:35.412
-Uhm, my old chemistry
professor, Mr. Dowling.
-Mm.

15:35.456 --> 15:37.501
Thank you for helping me
grow the best weed on campus.

15:37.545 --> 15:40.461
I'm so--
so honored and high right now.

15:43.246 --> 15:44.465
-Look, what's with the--
-I'm not worried.

15:44.508 --> 15:45.945
What's with the box?

15:45.988 --> 15:47.337
It's a class I'm taking.

15:47.381 --> 15:49.122
-A class you're taking?
-Yeah.

15:49.165 --> 15:50.993
-What's it about?
-A cat.

15:51.037 --> 15:52.342
-A cat?
-Yes.

15:52.386 --> 15:53.561
Oh, like the The Cat in the Hat?

15:53.604 --> 15:55.215
No, it's a--

15:55.258 --> 15:58.305
a real cat,
with not a hat, in a box.

15:58.348 --> 15:59.871
What?

15:59.915 --> 16:01.482
It's a thought experiment.

16:01.525 --> 16:03.310
-I don't get your thinking.
-Well, clearly.

16:04.659 --> 16:07.618
- So, what's
the cat's name?
- I don't know.

16:07.662 --> 16:11.231
-You don't know your cat's name?
-I don't know.
I told you, it's not my cat.

16:12.667 --> 16:13.973
Whose cat is it?

16:14.016 --> 16:15.583
I don't-- It's not-- it's uh...

16:15.626 --> 16:17.802
The uh, Schroöd-- Schrodinger.

16:17.846 --> 16:20.066
What? Neighbor of yours?

16:20.109 --> 16:21.502
The physicist...

16:21.545 --> 16:24.113
The Erwin Schroödinger.

16:24.157 --> 16:25.767
Ah, your next door neighbor.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.595
-He lived in Vienna.
-Lived?

16:27.638 --> 16:29.510
-He's dead.
-Ok.

16:29.553 --> 16:32.643
Who went first, Schroödinger
or his cat? What's going on?

16:32.687 --> 16:34.254
What's wrong?
Cat got your tongue?

16:34.297 --> 16:35.559
-Ok...
-There we go.

16:40.477 --> 16:43.480
Alright. That's actually
a really interesting question.

16:43.524 --> 16:45.656
Because the point is that, uh,

16:45.700 --> 16:50.183
-Schroödinger sealed his cat
in a box with a flask of poison.
-Poison?

16:50.226 --> 16:53.621
And if the monitor
detected radio activity,

16:53.664 --> 16:57.451
then the flask would,
uh, shatter
and it would kill the cat.

16:57.494 --> 16:58.887
Does PETA know about this?

16:59.844 --> 17:01.498
It's not a real cat,
first of all.

17:01.542 --> 17:03.022
You said it was a real cat.

17:03.065 --> 17:04.806
Well, I lied. It's physics.

17:04.849 --> 17:06.199
I'm confused.

17:06.242 --> 17:08.288
Half the time, the cat dies,

17:08.331 --> 17:10.159
and the other half
of the time, it lives.

17:10.203 --> 17:11.943
And that's a superposition.

17:11.987 --> 17:13.380
It doesn't sound so super to me.

17:14.250 --> 17:19.255
Meaning, the cat is
simultaneously alive and dead,

17:19.299 --> 17:20.300
at the same time.

17:20.343 --> 17:21.649
Like a zombie kitty, cool.

17:24.478 --> 17:26.480
It's the laws
of quantum entanglement.

17:26.523 --> 17:28.438
-My last relationship.
-Probability and outcome.

17:28.482 --> 17:30.179
Proba-- Probability and outcome?

17:30.223 --> 17:32.747
Yes! Because we know
the probability, Adam.

17:32.790 --> 17:36.881
But in order
to find out the outcome,
we have to peek inside the box.

17:36.925 --> 17:39.710
Hmm. So...

17:39.754 --> 17:43.105
-So, it's the observation...
-Right.

17:43.149 --> 17:44.802
-that you would have...
-I see.

17:44.846 --> 17:47.544
...uh, that seals
the cat's fate.

17:47.588 --> 17:52.201
-So, curiosity...
-...killed the cat.

17:58.338 --> 17:59.295
I gotta go.

18:00.601 --> 18:01.819
So now the real set can begin.

18:01.863 --> 18:03.256
Guys, I'm Adam. How are you?

18:05.736 --> 18:06.607
Hey.

18:07.825 --> 18:08.696
Hi.

18:10.306 --> 18:11.177
Hi.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.005
I'm Karen.

18:16.921 --> 18:17.966
I'm Steve.

18:45.167 --> 18:47.082
- No.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.737
Help me. Mm.

18:53.828 --> 18:54.829
Oh my God!

18:59.442 --> 19:00.704
- Oh boy.
- This is...

19:57.587 --> 19:59.285
Karen passed away this morning.

22:34.570 --> 22:36.224
- Proceed.

22:36.267 --> 22:38.922
Your Honor,

22:38.966 --> 22:42.404
Mr. Harrison should be granted
primary custody of Stevie.

22:42.448 --> 22:45.712
He's the sole financial
provider, he loves his son,

22:45.755 --> 22:47.627
and has been a very
attentive father.

22:47.670 --> 22:50.673
Your Honor, Mrs. Harrison
is with little Stevie

22:50.717 --> 22:53.415
24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

22:53.459 --> 22:57.332
Whereas Mr. Harrison
is absent most of the time,

22:57.376 --> 23:00.335
doing God knows what
with God knows who.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.858
Oh, we're all very aware

23:01.902 --> 23:04.687
of Mrs. Harrison's direct
communications with God.

23:04.731 --> 23:08.517
As well as Mr. Harrison's
nightly bouts with the bottle.

23:09.431 --> 23:11.390
A little nightcap
never hurt anyone.

23:11.433 --> 23:14.088
Unless you are a six year old
boy watching his father

23:14.131 --> 23:16.307
pass out in front
of the television every night.

23:16.351 --> 23:17.483
Counselors.

23:19.136 --> 23:20.834
As the court will recognize,

23:20.877 --> 23:24.620
a young boy needs a strong
masculine role model.

23:24.664 --> 23:27.580
Especially in these
very disconcerting times
of social unrest.

23:27.623 --> 23:30.452
It is clear that Mr. Harrison's

23:30.496 --> 23:36.023
secretive lifestyle choices
make him unsuitable
as residential custodian.

23:36.066 --> 23:38.547
Your Honor!
We can provide further evidence

23:38.591 --> 23:40.331
if necessary, your Honor.

23:43.987 --> 23:46.120
I don't think
we need to do that.

23:46.163 --> 23:47.948
I'm sure there's something
we can work out.

23:47.991 --> 23:50.124
That's enough! Stevie!

23:51.386 --> 23:53.823
I'd like you
and I to have a little talk.

23:55.085 --> 23:56.609
30 minute recess.

24:04.573 --> 24:06.183
Do you like jelly beans?

24:09.012 --> 24:10.013
Oh, good.

24:11.275 --> 24:12.320
Come.

24:24.898 --> 24:27.335
I'm going to
ask you some questions,

24:27.378 --> 24:32.253
and for every answer,
I want you to place a jelly bean
in one of these scales. Ok?

24:35.343 --> 24:37.606
This scale
represents your father.

24:37.650 --> 24:39.652
This scale, your mother.

24:39.695 --> 24:40.783
Ok?

24:42.263 --> 24:43.264
Ok.

24:44.613 --> 24:47.355
Who usually takes you
to school in the morning?

24:47.398 --> 24:50.489
Remember, put a jelly bean in
this side if it's your father,

24:50.532 --> 24:52.229
in this side
if it's your mother.

25:02.718 --> 25:04.285
Who plays more games with you?

25:10.334 --> 25:13.599
Stevie, do you have a room
in both your mother's house

25:13.642 --> 25:15.122
and your father's apartment?

25:16.123 --> 25:17.428
Which do you like better?

25:26.263 --> 25:27.264
Ok.

25:28.527 --> 25:31.312
If you accidentally
broke something,

25:32.443 --> 25:34.620
which parent do you think
would forgive you?

25:40.800 --> 25:45.239
If your parents broke something,
which parent would you forgive?

26:00.646 --> 26:02.517
Stevie.

26:02.561 --> 26:06.521
A broken marriage
is hard on everyone.

26:06.565 --> 26:10.743
And it is never,
never the child's fault.

26:10.786 --> 26:15.661
Sometimes things just don't work
out the way we want them to.

26:16.575 --> 26:17.924
Do you understand?

26:20.013 --> 26:23.494
It's my job to determine
what's best for you.

26:24.757 --> 26:26.106
What you want.

26:28.891 --> 26:30.893
I want my family back.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.044
Where are you?

27:35.088 --> 27:36.219
I'm here.

27:36.263 --> 27:37.656
I can't see you.

27:37.699 --> 27:39.527
There's something
I never told you.

27:39.570 --> 27:42.225
- What?
- I'm a
little claustrophobic.

27:44.445 --> 27:45.751
Define a little bit.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.754
Panic attack.

27:48.797 --> 27:50.451
Now?

27:50.494 --> 27:51.539
Soon.

27:52.801 --> 27:53.846
Take my hand.

27:57.763 --> 28:00.853
We haven't
been married 10 minutes
and I already feel trapped.

28:02.724 --> 28:04.204
Oh God.

28:05.248 --> 28:06.641
Oh my God.

28:06.685 --> 28:09.209
No, just shh, shh, it's ok.

28:13.300 --> 28:14.649
See? Everything's ok.

28:18.087 --> 28:19.610
I hope this isn't a sign.

28:23.614 --> 28:25.355
Oh, thank God.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.462
Steve, what are you doing?

28:48.901 --> 28:50.076
Let's take the stairs.

29:55.706 --> 30:01.321
- Oh my God. Dude, I got
it all over my pants, man.

30:01.364 --> 30:04.933
-Peed my pants.
-I'm so sorry.

32:14.280 --> 32:16.064
Karen, did I wake you?

32:17.979 --> 32:19.546
When were you going
to tell me about this?

32:20.895 --> 32:22.288
What?

32:22.331 --> 32:24.768
You were fired
three weeks ago, Steve?

32:26.640 --> 32:28.990
-I wasn't.
-Stop drinking,
or I'm leaving you!

33:28.093 --> 33:30.834
And the race is on! O-Oh!

33:34.316 --> 33:36.536
-I'm catching up. I'm
catching up. I'm catching up.
-Nope. No.

33:36.579 --> 33:37.928
Ah... I'm ahead!

33:37.972 --> 33:39.800
-And Dad pulls ahead.
-Ah, yeah.

33:41.932 --> 33:42.977
Oh, yeah.

33:46.067 --> 33:46.937
Oh, no.

33:48.635 --> 33:50.680
-I'm in the lead!
-There goes Stevie,
Stevie's in the lead,

33:50.724 --> 33:53.292
but Dad's coming up strong!
I'm gonna catch--
Coming up, Ah!

33:53.335 --> 33:55.424
-Oh, no, Stevie wins!
-I'm the winner!

33:55.468 --> 33:57.905
You're the winner. Good job,
Tiger, you get the prize.

33:57.948 --> 33:59.907
Thank you, Dad.

33:59.950 --> 34:00.995
Here we go.

34:03.476 --> 34:07.306
Because you are
the winner, Stevie.

34:08.263 --> 34:10.222
-Yeah.
-Do me a favor.

34:10.265 --> 34:13.094
Go pop supper in the oven
and get Dad three fingers, ok?

34:13.138 --> 34:14.182
-Ok.
-Good job.

34:30.155 --> 34:31.417
Hello?

34:44.169 --> 34:45.213
How early?

34:51.611 --> 34:54.570
Well, I only get him
once a week as it is.

35:05.712 --> 35:08.018
I will make it up
next week. I was-

35:08.062 --> 35:11.152
I was not fired, I was laid off.

35:23.556 --> 35:25.775
Pictures? For Christ's sakes!

35:38.092 --> 35:39.659
You are not
taking him away from me!

36:10.907 --> 36:12.822
Stevie, are you ok in there?

36:12.866 --> 36:14.520
Yeah, almost done!

36:17.087 --> 36:19.002
No, he- Nothing, he's fine.

36:42.765 --> 36:43.984
Fine!

36:56.997 --> 36:58.041
Dad?

37:01.567 --> 37:03.133
Stevie...

37:03.177 --> 37:04.874
Come. Come sit.

37:06.049 --> 37:06.963
Thank you.

37:09.314 --> 37:11.011
I have something.

37:11.054 --> 37:12.099
What?

37:25.330 --> 37:26.679
Is this your report card?

37:32.337 --> 37:34.121
Reading and Literature, A.

37:35.296 --> 37:37.777
Mathematics, B.

37:37.820 --> 37:39.561
Social Studies, B+.

37:44.305 --> 37:46.264
Stevie,
I'm so proud of you, son.

37:50.050 --> 37:51.834
"Stevie is a hard worker.

37:51.878 --> 37:54.837
His comprehension of
the subject matter and retention

37:54.881 --> 37:56.186
are above average.

38:00.103 --> 38:03.019
However, Stevie has difficulty
fitting in with other students

38:03.063 --> 38:04.499
and is easily distracted.

38:04.543 --> 38:06.588
His odd behavior
in social situations

38:06.632 --> 38:08.590
makes it difficult
for him to conform."

38:13.552 --> 38:14.683
Hey.

38:19.732 --> 38:21.560
I think that part
belongs over there.

38:25.346 --> 38:26.695
Hold on to the good stuff.

38:34.877 --> 38:35.922
Stevie.

38:37.445 --> 38:39.229
You know
that if I could change...

38:41.188 --> 38:42.232
things,

38:43.625 --> 38:45.845
I would in a heartbeat.

38:45.888 --> 38:47.412
I love you so much, Stevie.

39:02.165 --> 39:04.907
I'm so, so sorry that things
are the way that they are.

39:09.434 --> 39:10.870
Come here.

40:10.538 --> 40:12.627
- Yeah.
- Wow,
look at that,

40:12.671 --> 40:14.237
you're pretty much done, huh?

40:15.195 --> 40:17.502
I'm almost done, Dad.

40:17.545 --> 40:19.678
Looks a little bit like a cobra.

40:19.721 --> 40:22.028
-Where are the eyes?
-It's not a cobra.

40:22.071 --> 40:23.682
It's actually like
a boa constrictor.

40:23.725 --> 40:25.814
Watch out 'cause I'm going
to make it bite you.

40:25.858 --> 40:27.381
Oh no.

40:27.425 --> 40:30.471
If you can see it,
'cause in one, two bite

40:30.515 --> 40:32.168
I can make it... Ah!

40:32.212 --> 40:34.649
Ah, I didn't-- Ouch.

40:34.693 --> 40:36.390
-l thought it bit me.
-It did.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.348
-This-- This is the gut.
-All the gut's all out!

40:38.392 --> 40:40.481
Argh!

40:46.574 --> 40:48.968
It's going on you, Dad!

40:49.011 --> 40:51.318
Ah, Dad!

40:51.361 --> 40:52.885
-Look!
-Oh, hi, Mom.

40:52.928 --> 40:54.452
All the guts came out...

40:54.495 --> 40:56.932
Of the snake, we got,
we killed the snake

40:56.976 --> 41:00.545
-and we were going to paint it,
and all the guts came out on us.
-We are and it's coming,

41:00.588 --> 41:01.546
and it's coming.

41:04.287 --> 41:06.855
-Oh my god!

41:43.413 --> 41:45.024
I'm not here.

41:46.678 --> 41:49.550
Hi, Steve, it's me, Adam.

41:50.769 --> 41:51.900
I miss you, man.

42:10.745 --> 42:12.878
Why aren't you at work?

42:12.921 --> 42:13.966
I got fired.

42:17.230 --> 42:18.274
Again.

42:22.322 --> 42:24.411
I know you don't want
to hear it from me.

42:26.413 --> 42:29.198
Look, I wish
we could talk, Steve.

42:29.242 --> 42:30.678
I just heard about Karen.

43:59.549 --> 44:01.073
The toilet, Steve?

44:18.743 --> 44:20.222
I know what I did was wrong.

44:22.311 --> 44:24.879
And I'll probably regret it
for the rest of my life.

44:32.800 --> 44:34.497
But I can't keep doing this.

44:38.240 --> 44:40.329
I'm taking Trevor
and I'm going to Dad's.

44:42.331 --> 44:44.116
Don't try
and contact me this time.

44:57.651 --> 45:01.263
So, could you call me, please?

45:02.830 --> 45:04.571
Message deleted.

47:09.739 --> 47:12.177
I have a headache. I'm gonna
go and lie down for a bit.

47:17.182 --> 47:18.705
That's enough sugar.

47:58.005 --> 48:02.357
♪ The weather to bring to you, who else, but the weather man? ♪

48:02.401 --> 48:04.316

with a chance of showers.

49:24.570 --> 49:25.614
Dad?

49:41.891 --> 49:43.371
It's ok to cry.

49:47.332 --> 49:48.202
I'm alright.

49:49.856 --> 49:54.208
Sylvester was a very good mouse
and we loved her very much.

49:54.252 --> 49:56.210
And although we didn't
have her for very long,

49:56.254 --> 49:58.996
she was still
a part of our family. Right?

50:00.084 --> 50:03.391
So, thank you, God,
for blessing us with Sylvester,

50:03.435 --> 50:05.350
and may she rest in peace.

50:07.439 --> 50:09.441
Do you want to say
a little something?

50:09.484 --> 50:11.182
No? Ok.

50:11.225 --> 50:12.400
Wait!

50:25.500 --> 50:27.328
Won't she be lonely in there?

50:27.372 --> 50:28.590
Oh, sweetheart.

50:29.809 --> 50:32.159
Sylvester isn't here anymore.

50:32.203 --> 50:33.247
She's already left.

50:36.076 --> 50:39.166
I know it's,
it's confusing, it's--

50:39.210 --> 50:41.734
It's like when a snake
sheds its skin,

50:42.735 --> 50:45.477
It doesn't need it anymore,
so it just leaves it behind.

50:49.742 --> 50:51.178
I love you.

50:51.222 --> 50:52.266
I love you too.

52:53.779 --> 52:54.954
The toilet, Steve?

53:43.785 --> 53:45.526
The point is...

53:47.311 --> 53:50.575
Schroödinger sealed his cat in a box with a flask of poison.

53:52.533 --> 53:54.231
And half the time, the cat dies,

53:54.274 --> 53:55.928
and the other half of
the time, it lives.

53:56.798 --> 53:58.322
It's a superposition.

54:28.352 --> 54:29.396
Dad?

54:38.013 --> 54:39.232
I just stood there...

54:40.712 --> 54:41.756
frozen.

54:47.588 --> 54:49.373
Maybe if I would have

54:49.416 --> 54:50.765
gotten there sooner...

54:52.941 --> 54:53.986
Anyway.

54:59.383 --> 55:00.514
God, she's slow.

55:02.995 --> 55:04.605
Uhm...

55:07.782 --> 55:08.827
How old were you?

55:10.829 --> 55:11.830
Six.

55:18.793 --> 55:20.752
What about, uh you?

55:20.795 --> 55:23.363
You have, you have something?

55:23.407 --> 55:25.278
That's...

55:25.322 --> 55:26.845
childhood traumatic?

55:28.890 --> 55:30.109
Ahem.

55:31.763 --> 55:35.767
My Mom died of cervical
cancer when I was five.

55:39.423 --> 55:40.902
Hmm, that's...

55:42.426 --> 55:43.818
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

55:43.862 --> 55:45.907
I'm such an idiot.

55:45.951 --> 55:47.605
It's ok.

55:47.648 --> 55:49.171
I barely remember her.

55:50.042 --> 55:53.828
But my Dad,
he makes a mean omelet

55:53.872 --> 55:56.701
and taught me
how to hit a curve ball

55:56.744 --> 56:00.182
which is very impressive, so...

56:02.489 --> 56:03.882
No.

56:07.668 --> 56:09.453
-Thanks.
-Busy--

56:12.804 --> 56:13.848
It's a busy night.

56:17.112 --> 56:21.987
-Yeah.
-So, how long did you and

56:22.030 --> 56:23.597
Adam work on the--

56:23.641 --> 56:25.425
-Don't say his name.

56:26.731 --> 56:28.210
Too long, too long.

56:28.254 --> 56:30.038
We needed the extra credit.

56:30.082 --> 56:31.823
-No, it was good, it was...
-Yeah?

56:31.866 --> 56:34.478
I laughed a couple of times.

56:34.521 --> 56:35.653
That's-- that's good.

56:35.696 --> 56:37.524
Mm-hm, the part about, uhm...

56:39.004 --> 56:41.267
-quantum entanglement was--
-Yeah.

56:41.310 --> 56:43.878
Yeah, you almost
made me forget my line.

56:44.836 --> 56:46.446
Hmm.

56:46.490 --> 56:47.491
I'm sorry.

56:47.534 --> 56:48.709
It's uhm...

56:49.580 --> 56:52.844
-It's really weird.
-Hmm?

56:53.801 --> 56:57.065
I just--
I don't even know you, but
I want to tell you everything.

57:00.721 --> 57:01.766
Me too.

57:07.075 --> 57:09.469
You know, I wasn't supposed
to be here tonight.

57:09.513 --> 57:10.688
My car didn't start.

57:11.819 --> 57:13.604
So, I was stuck on campus.

57:13.647 --> 57:15.257
Saw a flyer.

57:15.301 --> 57:16.650
Hmm.

57:16.694 --> 57:17.738
Lucky me.

57:19.348 --> 57:20.393
Me too.

57:33.928 --> 57:35.408
I love you.

57:36.888 --> 57:37.976

57:39.586 --> 57:40.500
Vodka rocks.

57:40.544 --> 57:42.067

58:43.607 --> 58:44.608

59:28.129 --> 59:29.914
There's something
I never told you.

1:01:14.845 --> 1:01:16.150
Yeah, just like that.

1:01:52.883 --> 1:01:54.623
Let me see.

1:01:54.667 --> 1:01:56.887
-I see you.
-I see you.

1:01:58.410 --> 1:02:01.369
Do you want to get ready for
daddy's big birthday surprise?

1:02:01.413 --> 1:02:02.544
Sure!

1:02:03.894 --> 1:02:05.634
-Ok.

1:02:07.419 --> 1:02:10.770
I'm gonna go wash up
for your birthday.

1:02:10.814 --> 1:02:12.119
Oh, cool.

1:02:15.209 --> 1:02:18.169
-Seems just like yesterday when
we were changing his diapers.

1:02:18.212 --> 1:02:20.693
And now he's pretty much
ready for college.

1:02:21.607 --> 1:02:22.695
Not quite.

1:02:27.091 --> 1:02:28.222
Your mom called.

1:02:31.573 --> 1:02:32.792
What did she want?

1:02:34.228 --> 1:02:35.969
Just to wish you
a happy birthday.

1:02:38.319 --> 1:02:39.364
You know what?

1:02:40.887 --> 1:02:43.194
I'm so happy right now
I might actually call her back.

1:02:52.159 --> 1:02:53.247
What was that for?

1:02:54.858 --> 1:02:56.033
I'm proud of you.

1:03:07.784 --> 1:03:08.785
Life is good.

1:03:14.878 --> 1:03:15.966
Maybe it's time.

1:03:23.930 --> 1:03:24.975
Are you sure?

1:03:28.892 --> 1:03:31.198
I know how you felt
being an only child.

1:03:33.287 --> 1:03:34.898
And things are going well.

1:03:43.907 --> 1:03:45.256
Let's make it a girl.

1:03:51.610 --> 1:03:53.568
Ahh!

1:03:53.612 --> 1:03:55.440
Look who it is!

1:03:55.483 --> 1:03:57.572
The big grown up man!

1:04:02.664 --> 1:04:04.971
Happy birthday, Dad!

1:04:05.015 --> 1:04:08.105
-I love you so much! Come on.
-Happy birthday!

1:04:08.148 --> 1:04:09.280
Let's go.

1:04:09.323 --> 1:04:10.542
Let's go.

1:04:10.585 --> 1:04:12.239
-Let's go!

1:04:27.167 --> 1:04:29.300
A snake's gonna get you.

1:04:32.956 --> 1:04:36.089

That is very big.

1:06:35.774 --> 1:06:37.994
-I stick my hand in it.
- Yes, small piece,
please.

1:06:38.037 --> 1:06:40.692
-Small piece...
-Just a teeny...

1:06:40.735 --> 1:06:42.172
-Touching it--
-Oh no!

There we go.

1:06:53.966 --> 1:06:57.317
What faces you're making.

1:07:00.364 --> 1:07:02.801
-You want a refill?

1:07:05.673 --> 1:07:06.805
Busy night.

1:07:11.679 --> 1:07:12.724
You've got Trevor!

1:07:39.490 --> 1:07:41.666
Hey.

1:07:41.709 --> 1:07:43.189
Thank you.

1:07:53.156 --> 1:07:55.549
-What'll you have?
- Vodka, rocks.

1:08:03.731 --> 1:08:07.387
Make it a Shirley Temple,
and a diet coke with a lime.

1:08:27.842 --> 1:08:28.713
It's been six months.

1:08:30.367 --> 1:08:31.411
Eight years.

1:08:32.325 --> 1:08:33.848
That's encouraging.

1:08:33.892 --> 1:08:34.980
How do you do it?

1:08:37.461 --> 1:08:38.636
A day at a time.

1:08:41.334 --> 1:08:42.509
And I want to live.

1:09:41.307 --> 1:09:42.482
Trevor!

1:11:48.608 --> 1:11:51.002
What happens
when life weighs down?

1:11:52.960 --> 1:11:57.748
When there is systemic
contribution...

1:11:57.791 --> 1:12:03.580
Isn't it true? Of course
you may have...
