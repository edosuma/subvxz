00:03.037 --> 00:04.972
ANNOUNCER: From Ryan Murphy,

00:05.005 --> 00:07.908
The Assassination
of Gianni Versace.

00:07.941 --> 00:10.544
Coming soon only on FX.

00:13.181 --> 00:16.817
FXX presents You're the Worst.

00:20.354 --> 00:24.725
Yes, I did choose to V.O.D.
the film through your service,

00:24.758 --> 00:27.928
but my end-user experience
was unsatisfactory.

00:27.961 --> 00:30.398
No, no. There was no lag time.

00:30.431 --> 00:31.732
Everything was fine.

00:31.765 --> 00:34.435
Well, you see, Mario,

00:34.468 --> 00:37.004
the problem is The Babadook...

00:37.037 --> 00:39.006
Yeah, it's not scary.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.574
(whispers):
It's actually so scary.

00:40.608 --> 00:41.875
-I'm gonna make you watch it.
-Then why do you

00:41.909 --> 00:43.611
-want a refund?
-They just give you free shit.

00:43.644 --> 00:46.614
I told U-verse that I got
seizures from watching Legion--

00:46.647 --> 00:48.716
they gave me six months NBA TV.

00:48.749 --> 00:49.717
-(whispers): Yeah.
-(car doors closing)

00:49.750 --> 00:51.885
-(car alarm chirps)
-Shit-sticks.

00:51.919 --> 00:54.588
Uh, hide. You can't be here.

00:54.622 --> 00:55.689
Gretchen can be anywhere!

00:55.723 --> 00:57.558
That crumplesack Neil
is dropping off Olivia.

00:57.591 --> 01:00.628
I'm not supposed to let a lover
hang with the kid until Whitney

01:00.661 --> 01:02.963
-meets her and approves.
-I'll meet your ex-wife.

01:02.996 --> 01:04.398
I'll meet anyone.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.900
I met January Jones once.

01:06.934 --> 01:09.237
Hey, Booner.
Olivia ran next door

01:09.270 --> 01:12.540
to play on the Coughlins'
trampoline. Okay, bye.

01:12.573 --> 01:15.776
Hey, so...
I've started seeing someone.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.478
She wants to meet Whitney.

01:17.511 --> 01:18.912
Oh. Uh...

01:18.946 --> 01:21.615
Our shared calendar says
she's free this afternoon.

01:21.649 --> 01:24.218
Shared calendar?
(mimics whip crack)

01:24.252 --> 01:25.786
(laughs)

01:25.819 --> 01:27.321
-Sorry.
-Real mature.

01:27.355 --> 01:28.422
-I said sorry.
-Whatever.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.424
Yes, Neil,
I have a hot girlfriend

01:30.458 --> 01:33.461
who likes it when I give it
to her every day, hard,

01:33.494 --> 01:34.795
sometimes twice.

01:34.828 --> 01:38.432
So, have fun
having zero sex ever.

01:38.466 --> 01:39.600
Why are you like this?!

01:39.633 --> 01:41.302
Maybe 'cause you're living
in my house,

01:41.335 --> 01:43.637
farting on my Tempur-Pedic,
next to my wife,

01:43.671 --> 01:45.639
you walking circumcision!

01:45.673 --> 01:47.408
-You need therapy.
-I don't...

01:47.441 --> 01:50.344
You need therapy!
You creepy little turd!

01:50.378 --> 01:52.613
-(door slams)
-You jug of ball sweat!

01:52.646 --> 01:54.515
This afternoon?

01:54.548 --> 01:56.784
Okay, bring it on.

01:56.817 --> 02:00.254
Once I get a gallon
of tomato juice and beer in me,

02:00.288 --> 02:01.922
I am hella charming.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.757
She's gonna grill you.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.593
Grill away, bitch.

02:05.626 --> 02:06.794
(gags)

02:06.827 --> 02:08.662
This ranch tastes funny, boo.

02:08.696 --> 02:09.663
We don't have ranch.

02:09.697 --> 02:11.399
*

02:20.541 --> 02:23.677
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

02:23.711 --> 02:26.714
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

02:26.747 --> 02:28.249
* Gonna leave you anyway.

02:33.521 --> 02:35.689
NPR ANNOUNCER: This week
on "Tip of My Tongue..."

02:35.723 --> 02:37.891
CONTESTANT: I guess I'd rename
the Miracle Mile the, uh,

02:37.925 --> 02:40.228
-Cursed Kilometer.
-(laughter)

02:40.261 --> 02:42.396
(Katherine laughs)

02:42.430 --> 02:43.564
Morning!

02:43.597 --> 02:44.565
Katherine.

02:44.598 --> 02:45.833
Hello.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.404
So...

02:50.438 --> 02:54.308
not that I regret last night...

02:54.342 --> 02:56.744
I mean, on principle,
I don't regret things,

02:56.777 --> 02:58.546
not even buying tickets

02:58.579 --> 03:00.714
to see Billy Bob Thornton's
band, but...

03:00.748 --> 03:02.583
But there are no sleepovers.

03:02.616 --> 03:05.519
Got it. Won't happen again.

03:15.929 --> 03:18.366
Well, it's been weird,

03:18.399 --> 03:20.668
but ultimately delightful
seeing you, Jimmy.

03:20.701 --> 03:24.238
You're right,
it got much bigger.

03:24.272 --> 03:25.539
-I'm just gonna get me coat.
-(phone vibrates)

03:27.475 --> 03:32.746
Hey, guess who's about to buy
his first brand-new car?

03:32.780 --> 03:36.216
My main dude Max has a guy
who sets up the loan

03:36.250 --> 03:39.353
and delivers it to you
like a pri-zza!

03:39.387 --> 03:42.390
What the hell does Gretchen mean
by this? "We need to talk."

03:42.423 --> 03:44.892
There's a special circle in hell
for people who say,

03:44.925 --> 03:47.561
"We need to talk,"
instead of just talking.

03:47.595 --> 03:48.562
Fire back, bruh.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.931
I shall.

03:53.401 --> 03:56.470
(chuckles):
Yeah.

03:56.504 --> 03:59.307
Take that.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.541
Well, I'm off.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.443
(phone vibrates)

04:05.346 --> 04:07.548
Where are you going?

04:07.581 --> 04:09.750
Meeting a few mates for brunch.

04:09.783 --> 04:13.487
Perfect. I need a mimosa or six.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.656
Let me just put on some pants.

04:23.297 --> 04:24.565
Nice.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.500
Right?

04:26.534 --> 04:30.404
YOUNG LINDSAY: Mommy, over here!
Mommy! Mommy! Mom!

04:30.438 --> 04:33.240
-This is so sweet.
-YOUNG LINDSAY (on video): Mom!

04:33.273 --> 04:36.510
Sweet? No! Look!

04:36.544 --> 04:38.679
You were doing foot sex
with Lou Diamond Phillips

04:38.712 --> 04:40.381
instead of
paying attention to us!

04:41.449 --> 04:44.985
Am I supposed to feel something
about that?

04:45.018 --> 04:46.920
Maybe regret
that your daughters--

04:46.954 --> 04:49.457
one more than the other,
obviously--

04:49.490 --> 04:51.258
are broken because of you.

04:51.291 --> 04:55.363
Lou and I happened to have had
explosive sexual chemistry.

04:55.396 --> 04:57.698
He could make me climax
by whispering in my ear.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.668
You ignored us constantly.
I played in the street,

05:00.701 --> 05:04.672
I ate watch batteries, I went
on a date with Edward Furlong.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.273
But you're fine.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.542
I am married to Vernon,

05:08.576 --> 05:12.380
a man who shaves his pubic hair
into the letter "V."

05:12.413 --> 05:13.947
Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.983
And I've got to get to the set.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.352
Go.

05:18.386 --> 05:21.689
Deal with your problems
like normal people.

05:21.722 --> 05:24.024
-Split a Klonopin.
-(Becca scoffs)

05:25.693 --> 05:29.497
You saw the tape.
We were... happy little girls.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.866
How did we turn out like this?

05:34.568 --> 05:38.372
Hey, did you ever hear from Lou
after he and Mom broke up?

05:38.406 --> 05:39.807
BECCA:
Never.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.975
-Did you?
-Not a peep.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.745
Unless he's the one who's been
leaving notes on my car

05:44.778 --> 05:47.515
saying "learn how to park."

05:47.548 --> 05:49.417
But it's weird. Isn't it?

05:49.450 --> 05:51.419
He lived with us for,
like, three years.

05:51.452 --> 05:55.489
Yeah, he drove me to dressage
every week in junior high,

05:55.523 --> 05:57.725
and then he just... disappeared.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.693
He wasn't there when I finally
got Princess Pamplemousse

05:59.727 --> 06:01.028
to do the moonwalk.

06:01.061 --> 06:04.231
That's what I'm saying: he could
have kept being our dad-not-dad,

06:04.264 --> 06:06.366
but he straight bailed.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.402
What if it's us?

06:08.436 --> 06:09.403
What?

06:09.437 --> 06:12.406
What if the reason
Mom neglected us

06:12.440 --> 06:15.342
and Lou vanished us
is that we've always sucked?

06:15.375 --> 06:16.444
(laughs):
No.

06:16.477 --> 06:19.212
I was the perfect, special girl.

06:19.246 --> 06:21.749
I...

06:23.751 --> 06:25.385
Let's go ask him.

06:25.419 --> 06:28.556
Mom misremembers everything
about our childhoods.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.724
She showed me a photo of her
and Christina Ricci

06:30.758 --> 06:32.926
on the set of Mermaids
and told me it was us

06:32.960 --> 06:34.628
on vacation in Orlando.

06:34.662 --> 06:36.430
Yes! Let's do it.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.932
Lou was always honest with us,
no matter--

06:38.966 --> 06:40.934
-and there's his dick. Okay.
-Oh.

06:48.676 --> 06:50.611
WHITNEY:
Gretchen.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.613
(quietly):
Balls.

06:52.646 --> 06:55.382
Yes. Gretchen is me.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.984
I mean, I.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.452
-Whitney.
-Oh.

07:05.793 --> 07:08.228
Hmm.

07:08.261 --> 07:12.966
I hope you don't mind, but I did
a little research on you.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.737
You post to Urban Dictionary
a lot.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.572
People got to know.

07:18.606 --> 07:20.774
You don't want people walking
around not knowing what you mean

07:20.808 --> 07:23.777
when you tell them
you just skunked a creamer.

07:23.811 --> 07:26.514
Um, did you know
there's a 14-year-old girl

07:26.547 --> 07:27.815
with your name?

07:27.848 --> 07:30.250
That is also me.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.653
I use "Lil' Gretch"
to catch pedophiles

07:32.686 --> 07:36.490
and occasionally cyberbully
Elle Fanning.

07:36.524 --> 07:38.258
Can I get you ladies a drink?

07:38.291 --> 07:39.760
Just an iced hibiscus tea.

07:39.793 --> 07:43.363
I'll have a Long Island...
juice.

07:43.396 --> 07:44.865
(ringtone plays)

07:44.898 --> 07:47.635
Oh, sorry.

07:47.668 --> 07:51.204
-(phone beeps)
-I got to take this.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.372
What?

07:52.405 --> 07:53.373
(whispers):
Hey.

07:53.406 --> 07:56.710
Double shot of PatrÃ³n
in my juice?

07:56.744 --> 07:58.546
And if you narc on me,
I will cut you.

07:58.579 --> 08:01.214
(quietly):
Okay.

08:01.248 --> 08:02.382
(sighs)

08:06.920 --> 08:08.455
GROUP (singsongy):
Sunday Funday,

08:08.488 --> 08:10.390
better than a Monday!

08:10.423 --> 08:14.728
Can only do it one way,
and that is the drunk way!

08:14.762 --> 08:16.997
-Gag.
-Really.

08:17.030 --> 08:20.367
My friends are all a bit posh.
Try not to embarrass me.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.369
(scoffs)
I am here to binge drink,

08:22.402 --> 08:24.872
read the Guardian on my phone,
and stumble home.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.541
I don't make friends.

08:27.575 --> 08:30.343
Oh! This is Charlie,
Mariel and Flynn.

08:30.377 --> 08:31.879
-Guys, Jimmy.
-Hello.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.413
Oh, six mimosas.

08:33.446 --> 08:35.382
Actually, just bring
a bottle of champagne

08:35.415 --> 08:36.917
-and a pitcher of juice.
-Mm-hmm.

08:38.385 --> 08:40.220
-What do you do, Jimmy?
-Novelist.

08:40.253 --> 08:41.622
-How do you know Katherine?
-Back home.

08:46.694 --> 08:49.830
Same question,
politely directed back at you.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.833
Well, actually, we all met
after Mariel gave a TED Talk

08:52.866 --> 08:54.735
about habit persistence.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.236
I'm a macro-economist.

08:56.269 --> 08:59.506
Halfway interesting.
What about you two?

08:59.539 --> 09:00.774
Architecture critic
for the Times.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.242
I work at JPL.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.577
Tell Jimmy about your robot.

09:03.611 --> 09:04.878
I don't want to bore the guy.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.546
I'm building

09:06.580 --> 09:09.216
a self-guided cryobot to drill
the ice deposits on Mars.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.685
-It's got spider legs.
-What?!

09:11.719 --> 09:13.787
-So, tell us about your book.
-Oh, it's just a spank book.

09:13.821 --> 09:15.689
Nobody's read it with dry hands.

09:15.723 --> 09:17.290
Oh, you'll appreciate this.

09:17.324 --> 09:20.293
I wrote most of it
in a tree house I designed.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.963
Hammered it together and
everything, with the big nails.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.765
Did you hear the ad for
next week's "Tip of My Tongue"?

09:24.798 --> 09:27.635
-That Tommy Vietor is so witty.
-Hush.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.369
So, what are you guys
all doing later?

09:29.402 --> 09:31.872
Heading to Pour Haus to taste
their Uco Valley Malbecs.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.241
Then, we have a reservation
for an escape room.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.776
It's labeled "impossible,"
but we'll see about that.

09:35.809 --> 09:36.977
(laughter)

09:37.010 --> 09:38.545
And the Astrid Jorgen,

09:38.578 --> 09:40.247
the Greenlandic Scream-Singer,

09:40.280 --> 09:41.715
is performing in Chinatown.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.483
Would you want to come?

09:43.516 --> 09:45.786
Wish he could, but you're busy
today, aren't you, Jimmy?

09:45.819 --> 09:47.721
Never!
If I'm being honest,

09:47.755 --> 09:50.390
I basically do nothing
most of the time.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.526
Yesterday, I nodded off halfway
through second breakfast.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.502
I almost wonder if I should
take this and sell it on eBay.

10:02.535 --> 10:03.570
Ooh.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.305
-Huh.
-No, '80s.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.340
-Becca! Lindsay!
-(Lindsay gasps)

10:07.374 --> 10:09.810
This is my car!

10:09.843 --> 10:11.244
Wow.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.946
This is a total panty-soaker.

10:12.980 --> 10:15.649
They threw in the Teen
Safety Package for free.

10:15.683 --> 10:17.985
So, my phone won't work
while the engine's on,

10:18.018 --> 10:20.954
and it beeps if I swear.
Max says...

10:20.988 --> 10:22.322
"Max says, Max says."

10:22.355 --> 10:24.925
Lindsay says it makes you
look doable.

10:24.958 --> 10:25.993
But we do it all the time.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.460
Ugh. Please stop.

10:28.495 --> 10:29.496
(squeals, whoops)

10:29.529 --> 10:31.765
JIMMY:
Okay, uh, careful, please.

10:31.799 --> 10:35.468
-Gentle, be gentle.
-How'd you nab a future car?

10:35.502 --> 10:38.638
Well, um, with my, uh,
spotty credit history,

10:38.672 --> 10:41.975
I had to take out
a seven-year loan with 20% APR.

10:42.009 --> 10:44.544
And as soon as
I put my foot on the gas,

10:44.577 --> 10:45.879
it started depreciating.

10:45.913 --> 10:47.881
Well, I "de-preciate" this car.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.382
Maybe I should cut my losses,
return it,

10:49.416 --> 10:50.617
and get something reasonable.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.852
I'm just a grunt...

10:51.885 --> 10:54.387
-Why is he still talking?
-Bored. Drive now.

10:55.588 --> 10:57.624
(slurping)

10:57.657 --> 10:59.993
Jesus Christ,
my job is a mess.

11:00.027 --> 11:01.394
And I'm still trying
to figure out

11:01.428 --> 11:02.629
the vacation hand-off
with Boone.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.798
And Neil keeps bugging me
about wanting braces.

11:04.832 --> 11:06.834
I'm sorry, would...

11:06.867 --> 11:09.336
would you mind
if I ordered a drink?

11:09.369 --> 11:10.503
Drinking during the day?

11:10.537 --> 11:12.639
Bring us two alcoholic drinks.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.808
-The same as...?
-Yes, the same as each other.

11:14.842 --> 11:15.909
Ketel One martini with a twist.

11:15.943 --> 11:17.377
I don't even know what that is.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.611
Two of those.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.216
I thought the pain of divorce
would end with the papers,

11:23.250 --> 11:25.886
but a breakup is the gift
that keeps on giving.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.421
Amen to that.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.523
So... what are
the other questions

11:30.557 --> 11:31.558
you have on your list?

11:31.591 --> 11:33.593
You could tell I had a list?

11:35.028 --> 11:37.397
I copied it from a blog.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.900
Okay.

11:39.933 --> 11:43.670
"True or false: dinosaur bones
are a lie sent by the devil."

11:43.703 --> 11:46.706
Guess it was a Christian blog?

11:46.740 --> 11:48.575
Bible's got some horny parts.

11:48.608 --> 11:49.843
(laughs)

11:49.877 --> 11:52.279
(gasps) Mmm.

12:07.928 --> 12:10.297
-Hey!
-(both gasp)

12:10.330 --> 12:12.232
Stay away from those lemons!

12:12.265 --> 12:13.767
Just because they're hanging
over the sidewalk,

12:13.801 --> 12:14.935
doesn't mean they're free!

12:14.968 --> 12:16.469
You people act

12:16.503 --> 12:18.972
like I don't need these lemons,
but I do.

12:19.006 --> 12:20.573
I need them very badly!

12:20.607 --> 12:23.911
It's Becca and Lindsay.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.378
Cottumaccio.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.914
You railed our mom.

12:26.947 --> 12:30.583
Sorry, you railed our mother,
in the '90s?

12:33.486 --> 12:34.487
Oh, my God.

12:34.521 --> 12:35.823
Mm.

12:35.856 --> 12:40.794
Becca? Lindsay?

12:40.828 --> 12:42.729
(laughing)

12:42.762 --> 12:44.664
Oh...

12:44.697 --> 12:46.699
*

12:50.603 --> 12:52.840
Mmm! This is good.

12:52.873 --> 12:55.442
It's Country Time.
My lemons aren't juicing lemons.

12:55.475 --> 12:59.246
So... what happened?

12:59.279 --> 13:01.614
(sighs)

13:01.648 --> 13:04.251
I loved your mom.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.419
And when she left me,
I was devastated.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.921
I couldn't even stay
in the city anymore.

13:07.955 --> 13:09.522
Everything reminded me of her.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.324
One day, I'm sitting
on my lanai,

13:11.358 --> 13:12.960
watching my gardeners,

13:12.993 --> 13:15.762
and I thought to myself,
"That's what I want to do."

13:15.795 --> 13:18.365
So, I told my agent,
"From now on, I'm offer-only,"

13:18.398 --> 13:20.367
and I moved out here,
and I put all my energy

13:20.400 --> 13:21.801
into my lemon grove.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.803
One thing I know for sure:

13:23.837 --> 13:26.506
lemons won't ever
walk out on me.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.541
Then why did you just disappear?

13:28.575 --> 13:30.377
Was it my bed-wetting?
Because I stopped

13:30.410 --> 13:32.212
eventually, mostly, sort of.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.813
Your mother forbade me from
ever contacting you again.

13:33.847 --> 13:34.915
I thought you knew that.

13:37.584 --> 13:38.886
(sighs)

13:38.919 --> 13:41.821
Listening to her is one
of my biggest regrets.

13:41.855 --> 13:43.623
That, and turning down Die Hard.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.658
-Why would our mother do that?
-I don't know.

13:45.692 --> 13:48.896
I wanted to ask her, but she had
moved on to dating John Stamos.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.663
You do not mess with that guy.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.699
I mean, the Beach Boys
were so scared of him,

13:52.732 --> 13:55.435
they let him pretend
to play bongos on "Kokomo."

13:56.836 --> 13:58.338
Well, I don't buy it.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.673
You don't just walk away
from people you love.

14:01.574 --> 14:02.842
What could I do, girls?

14:02.876 --> 14:04.577
I had no choice.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.513
Hey,

14:06.546 --> 14:09.316
I've always wondered--

14:09.349 --> 14:11.384
did you ever get Princess
Pamplemousse to moonwalk?

14:13.386 --> 14:14.721
I did.

14:14.754 --> 14:18.391
Ultimately, it led to
a hairline fracture in her shin,

14:18.425 --> 14:19.993
and we had to shoot her,
but...

14:20.027 --> 14:22.562
-she got me that blue ribbon.
-And, Lindsay,

14:22.595 --> 14:24.764
you had always talked about
being a dinosaur.

14:24.797 --> 14:25.999
How'd that go?

14:26.033 --> 14:28.001
(laughs)

14:28.035 --> 14:30.003
So this is Mom's fault.

14:30.037 --> 14:32.005
Sorry.

14:32.039 --> 14:34.807
We got to go pour water
on a witch.

14:35.909 --> 14:37.744
Thanks, La Bamba-Dad.

14:37.777 --> 14:40.680
Good luck with your lemons.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.782
Oh, I need more than luck.

14:44.584 --> 14:45.752
(exhales)

14:51.424 --> 14:53.593
I'm tasting plum,
with hints of violet.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.963
And then licorice
and, um, barberry.

14:55.996 --> 14:59.466
Hmm, it seems the fruit
was harvested too early.

14:59.499 --> 15:00.934
Oh, why do you say that?

15:00.968 --> 15:04.938
Because I'm tasting notes
of statutory grape.

15:10.477 --> 15:11.444
Mmm.

15:11.478 --> 15:13.580
(sustaining off-key note)

15:13.613 --> 15:16.416
*

15:16.449 --> 15:17.917
(laughing)

15:17.951 --> 15:20.954
-Shh!
-Shh, shh!

15:20.988 --> 15:24.224
I'm thinking it might be
the outside ones that...

15:24.257 --> 15:25.392
You can tilt.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.961
No! No, no, no.

15:27.995 --> 15:30.363
Ooh!
(stammers)

15:32.632 --> 15:36.903
(scream-singing continues)

15:36.936 --> 15:39.439
(all laughing)

15:42.275 --> 15:43.910
Rystar! That says rystar!

15:43.943 --> 15:45.445
Uh, Rystar... knight!

15:45.478 --> 15:46.513
Rystar means knight!

15:46.546 --> 15:47.914
Night! Uh... nighttime!

15:47.947 --> 15:49.349
KATHERINE:
No, here, here, here!

15:49.382 --> 15:50.650
Here's the knight,
here's the knight!

15:50.683 --> 15:51.684
55!

15:51.718 --> 15:53.420
Ooh, the lock, the lock.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.787
Yeah.

15:54.821 --> 15:56.456
Oh, I can't breathe.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.591
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

15:58.625 --> 16:01.528
-Photos. -I'm claustrophobic,
can you let me out?

16:01.561 --> 16:05.198
-Let me out!
-(pounding on door)

16:05.232 --> 16:09.536
Let me out!
Let me out!

16:09.569 --> 16:13.340
(buzzer sounds)

16:13.373 --> 16:14.941
Oy.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.709
Ta-da! I escaped us.

16:16.743 --> 16:19.346
-(sighs)
-Stupid.

16:19.379 --> 16:23.216
There is this one mom in the PTA

16:23.250 --> 16:26.686
that I think about knifing
so much,

16:26.719 --> 16:29.522
I should take out
a restraining order on me.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.558
You are nuts, hooker!

16:31.591 --> 16:33.726
I used to be fun.

16:33.760 --> 16:37.864
I used to wear low-rise jeans
and 'shroom in Joshua Tree.

16:37.897 --> 16:43.470
And now, I have to be the
grown-up, but I want to be fun.

16:43.503 --> 16:44.804
Hey, now!

16:44.837 --> 16:48.375
You are just a lady
doing her A-plus best.

16:48.408 --> 16:52.379
-Mm-hmm. -I wish I had a mom
like you. Can I call you Mom?

16:52.412 --> 16:54.914
I'm glad Boone
found someone nice.

16:54.947 --> 16:59.352
He was so lonely for so long.

16:59.386 --> 17:00.520
Aw.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.389
Let's get another round.
(laughs)

17:02.422 --> 17:04.724
(whistles)

17:04.757 --> 17:08.561
One thing I do miss
is the spontaneousness.

17:08.595 --> 17:09.996
On our second date,
Boone drove us

17:10.029 --> 17:11.364
(distorted):
to Portland to...

17:11.398 --> 17:14.267
GRETCHEN:
No. Gretch, don't black out.

17:14.301 --> 17:16.336
(voice echoing indistinctly)

17:16.369 --> 17:20.540
GRETCHEN: Not now. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no! (grunts)

17:23.576 --> 17:27.414
(Whitney moaning)

17:31.718 --> 17:34.954
Oh. Mmm.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.391
GRETCHEN:
Oh, God.

17:38.425 --> 17:41.228
Oh, no. Why is this?

17:41.261 --> 17:42.895
Harder!

17:44.597 --> 17:46.299
(Whitney moaning)

17:46.333 --> 17:47.467
(giggling):
Oh, God.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.236
This is fun.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.803
I feel fun!
(laughing)

17:50.837 --> 17:53.740
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no...

17:53.773 --> 17:55.408
Here I go.
Here I go.

17:55.442 --> 17:56.743
Oh...

17:56.776 --> 17:59.812
Boomtown!
(screams)

17:59.846 --> 18:01.781
Oh...

18:01.814 --> 18:04.651
(mouthing)

18:11.824 --> 18:13.760
JIMMY (laughing):
Statutory grape.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.763
I should sell that one
to the funny-pages.

18:16.796 --> 18:19.232
Edgar, call a tow truck.

18:19.266 --> 18:22.835
Someone's left a try-hardy
luxury sedan in my car park.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.904
Actually, that's mine.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.240
But... you're poor.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.808
I'm not poor.
I'm a writer now.

18:28.841 --> 18:31.644
That doesn't matter.
You have poor brain.

18:31.678 --> 18:34.247
Do you know how I know?
Because I have poor brain.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.649
-Jimmy! -Do you know what I did
with the outsized advance

18:36.683 --> 18:37.850
for my first book?

18:37.884 --> 18:40.453
I bought a house
that I couldn't afford.

18:40.487 --> 18:44.257
I got an FHA loan,
so I only put down 3.5%,

18:44.291 --> 18:47.927
but it's an ARM
on a balloon structure,

18:47.960 --> 18:49.796
which means by the end
of next year,

18:49.829 --> 18:52.465
I may have to burn it
for the insurance,

18:52.499 --> 18:54.601
which I do not have.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.303
Return the car.

18:56.336 --> 18:57.370
No, Jimmy.

18:57.404 --> 18:59.639
You forfeited your right
to tell me what to do.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.348
(sighs)

19:08.381 --> 19:10.517
(phone vibrates)

19:11.718 --> 19:12.752
(phone beeps)

19:13.920 --> 19:16.323
Maximus.

19:16.356 --> 19:18.558
Oh, the whip?

19:22.429 --> 19:24.831
You got to come check it out.

19:24.864 --> 19:28.701
I am so glad you suggested
I buy it.

19:30.270 --> 19:34.707
Hell yeah, I sprung for the all-
vegan leather package. (laughs)

19:37.244 --> 19:39.346
Mom! We're coming in!

19:39.379 --> 19:40.713
(gasps)

19:40.747 --> 19:42.349
Hi, girls.

19:42.382 --> 19:46.486
So, wait, you dated John Stamos,
then Dave Coulier?

19:46.519 --> 19:50.323
-That is not the direction
it's supposed to go. -I know.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.924
LINDSAY:
What's going on here?

19:51.958 --> 19:54.561
Why is La Bamba-Dad
in your house-car?

19:54.594 --> 19:56.429
And which is it,
a house or a car?

19:56.463 --> 19:58.598
And where does the poop go?

19:58.631 --> 20:00.400
Your visit inspired me
to reach out to Faye

20:00.433 --> 20:01.768
after all these years.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.936
I'm so glad you all reconnected.

20:03.970 --> 20:06.239
Well, we're glad too, Mom.

20:06.273 --> 20:08.875
Because we started to think the
reason we never heard from him

20:08.908 --> 20:10.377
was because there was
something wrong with us.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.245
But, now we know, there's
nothing wrong with me at all.

20:12.279 --> 20:14.847
He told us you forbidded him
from ever contacting us.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.216
-(knock on door) -WOMAN:
We're inviting first team, Faye.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.685
Well?

20:18.718 --> 20:21.220
It's true. I did.

20:21.254 --> 20:22.389
Why would you do that?

20:22.422 --> 20:24.891
Because I could see
how close you all were getting,

20:24.924 --> 20:27.560
and I knew it wasn't going
to last between Lou and me.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.429
I did it to protect you.

20:29.462 --> 20:32.231
-(knock on door) -WOMAN:
Cameras are ready, Faye.

20:32.265 --> 20:33.466
-Will you give us a second?!
-We are very busy

20:33.500 --> 20:34.567
blaming our mother
for everything!

20:34.601 --> 20:36.436
-This is very, very important!
-Go, go, go!

20:37.737 --> 20:39.939
You two are adults.

20:39.972 --> 20:41.974
You're goddamned baked.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.477
If your lives are a mess,
you figure it out.

20:47.447 --> 20:48.481
(scoffs)

20:53.986 --> 20:55.322
She's right, you know.

20:55.355 --> 20:58.425
Instead of sitting around
being angry at your mom,

20:58.458 --> 21:00.627
I decided to buy some land
in the country

21:00.660 --> 21:02.929
and focus my energy
on growing a real orchard.

21:02.962 --> 21:06.499
And now, I just kick back
and wait for La Croix to call.

21:06.533 --> 21:07.900
(sighs)

21:07.934 --> 21:11.904
You can't solve your problems
by blaming the past.

21:11.938 --> 21:13.506
Then how do we solve them?

21:15.708 --> 21:16.943
You have a kid.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.578
Be a good parent.

21:18.611 --> 21:19.746
Break the cycle.

21:19.779 --> 21:20.947
It's too late.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.949
Vernon's her father.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.817
Tallulah's headed straight
for the pole.

21:24.851 --> 21:26.753
What about me?

21:26.786 --> 21:28.455
I don't have a kid.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.423
You were such a giving child.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.258
It's true.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.461
She used to dump her dinner
in the toilet

21:34.494 --> 21:36.996
because she felt bad that
it only ever got to eat poop.

21:37.029 --> 21:38.931
Maybe you're supposed to
help other people.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.300
*

21:41.334 --> 21:43.703
Help people.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.505
Okay.

21:45.538 --> 21:48.441
In fact, you've already started
by helping me do something

21:48.475 --> 21:50.309
that I've wanted to do
for years:

21:50.343 --> 21:53.680
have sex with your mom
one last time.

21:58.585 --> 22:01.954
Your friends
are so sophisticated.

22:01.988 --> 22:05.324
You know, my only friends
are this divorced girl

22:05.358 --> 22:08.995
with citrus blindness
and a redheaded doctor

22:09.028 --> 22:11.230
who might be a legal imbecile.

22:11.263 --> 22:13.733
Are they, uh,
available tomorrow?

22:13.766 --> 22:15.902
I'm not bringing you
around my friends again.

22:18.371 --> 22:20.807
What?

22:20.840 --> 22:22.208
They didn't like me?

22:22.241 --> 22:24.210
You behaved
like a complete rube.

22:24.243 --> 22:26.479
You were our redheaded doctor!

22:26.513 --> 22:29.549
Jimmy, I moved across the world
on purpose.

22:29.582 --> 22:32.218
All you do is remind me
of the past.

22:32.251 --> 22:33.886
Bye, Jimmy.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.788
Wait.

22:38.391 --> 22:40.993
Can we still go to JPL?

22:41.027 --> 22:42.595
I want to see the spider robot.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.965
*

22:53.039 --> 22:54.874
Ah.

22:54.907 --> 22:56.409
Mmm!

22:56.443 --> 22:59.912
-Right? It's like getting drunk
on salsa. -(chuckles)

23:03.416 --> 23:06.553
Oh, um, Whitney texted the okay.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.421
She really, really likes you.

23:10.256 --> 23:11.958
Oh, that's such good news.

23:11.991 --> 23:14.694
Also, they refunded me the
seven bucks for The Babadook.

23:14.727 --> 23:17.530
Suckers!

23:17.564 --> 23:18.898
Ah.

23:18.931 --> 23:21.601
Ah...

23:23.670 --> 23:26.405
Good job, you.
She's a tough nut to crack.

23:26.439 --> 23:27.940
I had to go deep.

23:27.974 --> 23:30.943
Really knuckle down.

23:30.977 --> 23:33.446
(quietly):
Boomtown.

crackled with the signal *

23:40.453 --> 23:43.322
* The national TV crews

23:43.355 --> 23:45.391

and vigils *

23:45.424 --> 23:48.461

23:48.495 --> 23:51.430

through her frozen blue eyes *

23:51.464 --> 23:54.300

checkout line front pages *

23:54.333 --> 23:56.302

pinned to the wall *

23:59.472 --> 24:02.609

literate, brilliant *

(dog barks)

24:14.453 --> 24:15.855
Hey, fellas.

24:15.888 --> 24:18.525
I'm on antidepressants,
so I won't even cry after.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.079
Mom.

24:41.347 --> 24:42.448
What?

24:42.481 --> 24:44.551
Can we adopt
a Syrian refugee baby?

24:44.584 --> 24:45.785
No!

24:45.818 --> 24:47.486
Mom, they're dying
every day.

24:47.520 --> 24:50.890
You're literally
murdering a baby
by not adopting one right now.

24:50.923 --> 24:52.124
Get out!
