05:17.117 --> 05:17.918
"I'M SORRY.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.522
ALL THE DRAMA WITH HIM

05:54.522 --> 05:56.557

06:50.578 --> 06:51.378
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING,

06:51.378 --> 06:52.179
'CAUSE I'M CONFINED.

06:52.179 --> 06:55.015
I CAN'T EVEN GO NOWHERE.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.316
SO ALL I'M DOING NOW IS,

06:56.316 --> 06:57.384
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST THINKING,

06:57.384 --> 06:59.119

07:05.893 --> 07:07.360
I MISS YOU.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.896
AND THE WAY I SEE IT,

07:08.896 --> 07:10.998
IT'S ALL THE WOMEN IN MY LIFE,

07:10.998 --> 07:12.666
STARTING WITH MY MOM.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.367
SO WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

07:14.367 --> 07:16.069

07:20.407 --> 07:21.509
OH, REALLY?

07:21.509 --> 07:22.109
THAT'S GOOD.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.176
THAT TAKE--I'M VERY PROUD OF

07:23.176 --> 07:24.778
YOU, I MUST SAY, BECAUSE IT DOES

07:24.778 --> 07:26.780
TAKE A BIG MAN TO UNDERSTAND

07:26.780 --> 07:28.081
WHERE HE IS AND WHERE NEEDS

07:28.081 --> 07:29.550
TO GET TO IN LIFE, YOU KNOW?

07:29.550 --> 07:32.385
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE

07:32.385 --> 07:34.287
'CAUSE BASICALLY, YOU KNOW,

07:34.287 --> 07:38.592
YOU, ERICA, SHAY...

07:39.760 --> 07:40.728
Y'ALL GOT ME--

07:40.728 --> 07:42.129
YOU KNOW, Y'ALL HAD ME SMOKING

07:42.129 --> 07:43.396
HEAVY, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

07:43.396 --> 07:45.098
HAD ME JUST GOING, GOING, GOING

07:45.098 --> 07:46.700
'CAUSE I AIN'T EVEN WANT TO,

07:46.700 --> 07:47.400
YOU KNOW--

07:47.400 --> 07:48.702
DEAL WITH US.

07:48.702 --> 07:49.670
I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

07:49.670 --> 07:51.004
ABOUT THE TRIGGERS

07:51.004 --> 07:52.640
WITH ME, ERICA, AND SHAY,

07:52.640 --> 07:54.241
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,

07:54.241 --> 07:56.009
WE ALL HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE.

07:56.009 --> 07:56.910
NO ONE'S CONTROLLING US,

07:56.910 --> 07:58.546
SO WE DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO.

07:58.546 --> 07:59.580
YOU DIDN'T SMOKE BECAUSE

07:59.580 --> 08:00.914
OF ME, SHAY, AND ERICA.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.249
I AIN'T PUT NO JOINT

08:02.249 --> 08:03.316
UP TO MY MOUTH.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.352
IT'S BEEN YOU ALL THE WHILE.

08:05.352 --> 08:07.621
SO I NEED FOR YOU TO STAND UP

08:07.621 --> 08:09.289
AND BE THAT MAN THAT I TAUGHT

08:09.289 --> 08:11.158
YOU TO BE AND STOP POINTING

08:11.158 --> 08:13.627
THE FINGER AT MOI.

08:13.627 --> 08:14.862
LOOK, MA, HALF OF MY PROBLEM,

08:14.862 --> 08:15.929
THE REASON WHY I WAS SMOKING,

08:15.929 --> 08:17.064
THESE HABITS, IS YOU.

08:17.064 --> 08:17.798
HALF?

08:17.798 --> 08:18.599
I PICK UP--

08:18.599 --> 08:20.000
NOT EVEN 1/3?

08:20.000 --> 08:20.734
NAW, HALF OF IT.

08:20.734 --> 08:21.569
YOU CAN'T GO DOWN TO 1/3?

08:21.569 --> 08:22.435
THE FIRST--LET ME TELL YOU--

08:22.435 --> 08:23.403
YOU CAN'T GO DOWN--

08:23.403 --> 08:24.638
YOU--BUST YOUR BUTT, BOY.

08:24.638 --> 08:25.438
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GOT

08:25.438 --> 08:26.239
TO LEARN HOW TO DO,

08:26.239 --> 08:27.040
WHICH YOU AIN'T--

08:27.040 --> 08:28.576
I KNOW IT'S HARD FOR YOU TO DO?

08:28.576 --> 08:29.977
BE THE BIGGER PERSON.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.011
LIKE, WE'RE FAMILY,

08:31.011 --> 08:31.712
SUPPOSED TO BE FAMILY.

08:31.712 --> 08:32.713
EVERYBODY RESPECT EACH OTHER,

08:32.713 --> 08:33.614
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

08:33.614 --> 08:36.584
WHAT--WHAT YOU AND ERICA GOT,

08:36.584 --> 08:37.384
THAT'S SOMETHING I CAN'T

08:37.384 --> 08:38.586
EVEN CONTROL, BUT AT THE SAME

08:38.586 --> 08:40.253
TIME, I CAN'T ASK MY MOM

08:40.253 --> 08:41.822
CONTINUOUSLY LIKE I DO

08:41.822 --> 08:42.823
TO PLEASE RESPECT HER,

08:42.823 --> 08:44.091
BECAUSE IT DON'T LOOK RIGHT

08:44.091 --> 08:45.125
TO HER GRANDDAUGHTER.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.594
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME ACCEPT HER.

08:46.594 --> 08:47.595
EVERY MAMA--EVERY MAMA--

08:47.595 --> 08:48.796
YOU CAN'T MAKE NOBODY--

08:48.796 --> 08:49.597
I CAN'T MAKE MY MAMA ACCEPT

08:49.597 --> 08:50.430
NOBODY.

08:50.430 --> 08:51.264
I'M COMING TO SEE HOW GOOD

08:51.264 --> 08:52.432
YOU'RE DOING, AND ALL I'VE HEARD

08:52.432 --> 08:53.300
ABOUT...

08:53.300 --> 08:54.067
BUT GUESS WHAT.

08:54.067 --> 08:54.835
WHAT I'M DOING.

08:54.835 --> 08:55.736
AND THAT'S NOT GONNA ROCK.

08:55.736 --> 08:56.604
BUT GUESS WHAT.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.505
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GONNA ROCK?

08:58.505 --> 08:59.206
THAT'S NOT GONNA ROCK.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.107
IT'S GONNA ROCK.

09:00.107 --> 09:00.941
LISTEN.

09:00.941 --> 09:01.709
YOU KEEP TRYING TO MAKE ME

09:01.709 --> 09:02.442
ACCEPT.

09:02.442 --> 09:03.476
NO, NO, THIS WHAT I'M GONNA

09:03.476 --> 09:04.377
TELL YOU, THOUGH.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.412
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACCEPT HER,

09:05.412 --> 09:06.680
BUT HOW DOES IT LOOK BEING

09:06.680 --> 09:07.881
HALF A FAMILY, THOUGH?

09:07.881 --> 09:09.249
YOU KNOW, I CHOSE ERICA TO BE

09:09.249 --> 09:10.417
MY BABY MAMA, AND THAT'S THE WAY

09:10.417 --> 09:11.619
IT IS.

09:11.619 --> 09:12.620
WHETHER ME AND ERICA TOGETHER

09:12.620 --> 09:13.754
OR NOT, WE STILL FAMILY.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.088
WE GOT A KID TOGETHER.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.356
SO IT'S EITHER GET WITH

09:16.356 --> 09:18.025
THE PROGRAM, MAMA,

09:18.025 --> 09:19.259
OR, YOU KNOW, I GOT TO MOVE ON

09:19.259 --> 09:20.761
AND DO WHAT I GOT TO DO.

09:20.761 --> 09:21.695

09:21.695 --> 09:23.130
YOU'RE MY MAMA AND YOU'RE IN

09:23.130 --> 09:24.231

09:24.231 --> 09:24.965
AND THE ONLY REASON WHY YOU

09:24.965 --> 09:25.633

09:25.633 --> 09:26.399
ALL RIGHT, DARRYL.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.234
BECAUSE YOU'RE MY MAMA.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.035

09:28.035 --> 09:29.536
SO CHILL OUT, DEBORAH.

MM-HMM. REALLY?

09:30.838 --> 09:31.705

09:43.817 --> 09:47.320

09:49.456 --> 09:50.658

09:50.658 --> 09:51.659
LOOK AT ME AND LISTEN

09:51.659 --> 09:52.693

09:52.693 --> 09:54.662
DO I ACCEPT THE APOLOGY

09:54.662 --> 09:56.129

09:56.129 --> 09:57.665
NO, I DON'T.

09:57.665 --> 09:58.832
IT SAYS,

09:58.832 --> 10:01.534
"J LOVE SJ, PARTNERS FOR LIFE."

10:01.534 --> 10:02.369
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THAT

10:02.369 --> 10:03.136

10:31.732 --> 10:32.666

10:34.201 --> 10:35.368

10:39.239 --> 10:40.573
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,

10:40.573 --> 10:41.875
THEY CAN'T STAY AWAY FROM ME.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.543

11:50.077 --> 11:50.878
I GUESS I CAN TELL YOU

11:50.878 --> 11:51.812
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.080
OH, MY GOD.

THAT'S THE RING?

12:06.426 --> 12:07.627
I ASKED HIM.

12:07.627 --> 12:08.929
STEVIE GAVE YOU THAT RING?

12:08.929 --> 12:09.696
I ALREADY HAD THIS RING,

12:09.696 --> 12:10.964
BUT I GAVE HIM A NEW RING.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.199
AND I WAS LIKE, LOOK...

12:12.199 --> 12:12.866

THAT'S RIGHT.

12:14.434 --> 12:15.268
OKAY, OKAY.

12:15.268 --> 12:16.036
WHERE'S YOUR RING

12:16.036 --> 12:17.838
THAT HE BOUGHT YOU?

12:17.838 --> 12:20.140
BUT SHE PROPOSED TO HIM,

12:20.140 --> 12:20.874
SO THERE WAS NO RING FROM

12:20.874 --> 12:21.909
STEVIE.

12:21.909 --> 12:22.642
I DON'T GIVE A [bleep]

12:24.577 --> 12:25.278
I SEE YOUR PASSION MORE

12:25.278 --> 12:25.946
THAN I SEE HIS,

12:25.946 --> 12:26.814
AND THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

12:26.814 --> 12:27.614
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

12:28.715 --> 12:29.616
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

12:29.616 --> 12:30.517

12:30.517 --> 12:31.852

12:31.852 --> 12:33.020
THAT'S JUST NOT ME.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.154
DO YOU HAVE A MAN?

12:34.154 --> 12:34.855
NO, I DON'T,

12:34.855 --> 12:36.089
AND I DON'T REALLY WANT ONE.

12:36.089 --> 12:36.924
SHE DON'T WANT NO [bleep].

12:36.924 --> 12:38.191
DON'T CUT ME OFF, ARIANE.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.159
DO YOU LIKE GIRLS?

17:49.035 --> 17:49.702
YOU'RE HEARING.

17:49.702 --> 17:50.703
I HEAR YOU, BUT GUESS WHAT.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.239
IT MEANS NOTHING TO YOU.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.179
DO I ACCEPT THE APOLOGY

17:59.179 --> 18:00.547
AT THIS VERY MOMENT?

18:00.547 --> 18:03.750
NO, I DON'T.

18:03.750 --> 18:04.917
YOU WANT YOUR FAMILY?

18:04.917 --> 18:06.953
YOU FIGURE IT OUT.

18:06.953 --> 18:09.856
AND I GOT TO GO.

18:09.856 --> 18:10.957
APPRECIATE THE GIFTS.

I CAN BE VERY HURTFUL.

18:29.542 --> 18:30.410
SHE WAS LYING.

18:30.410 --> 18:31.544
AFTER YOU SAY SHE WAS LYING,

18:31.544 --> 18:33.079
YOU GO TO MAKE A VIDEO ABOUT

18:33.079 --> 18:34.080

19:07.214 --> 19:08.648
ABOUT JOSELINE AND STEVIE'S

19:08.648 --> 19:09.649

19:09.649 --> 19:10.717
BUT ARIANE THOUGHT THAT WE

19:10.717 --> 19:12.985
SHOULD WARN MIMI JUST IN CASE

19:12.985 --> 19:13.986
STEVIE TRY TO RUB HER NOSE

19:13.986 --> 19:14.654
IN IT.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.357
LET'S SEE THE [bleep].

19:19.626 --> 19:20.493

19:20.493 --> 19:21.261
GONNA STAY?

19:21.261 --> 19:22.629
NO, THEY'RE STILL SWOLLEN.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.331
I GOT TO, YOU KNOW,

19:24.331 --> 19:26.098
EXERCISE AND RUB THEM DOWN

19:26.098 --> 19:27.967
'CAUSE THE IMPLANT IS STILL

19:27.967 --> 19:28.735

19:28.735 --> 19:29.602

19:30.837 --> 19:31.704

19:36.443 --> 19:37.244
YOU KNOW SHE TOLD US

19:37.244 --> 19:39.045
SHE WAS MOVING TO NEW YORK.

19:39.045 --> 19:39.912
MOVING MOVING?

19:39.912 --> 19:41.814
LIKE, OUT OF HERE.

19:41.814 --> 19:42.482
OH.

19:42.482 --> 19:43.149
SHE SAYS SHE'S DONE.

19:43.149 --> 19:44.351
PERMANENTLY.

19:44.351 --> 19:45.418
OH.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.586
OKAY, WELL...

19:46.586 --> 19:47.554
SHE SAID SHE'S OUTGROWN

19:47.554 --> 19:48.421
ATLANTA.

19:48.421 --> 19:49.155
IT WAS INTERESTING.

19:49.155 --> 19:51.458
IT WAS AN INTERESTING PARTY,

19:51.458 --> 19:53.426
AND...

19:53.426 --> 19:54.761
KIND OF WEIRD.

19:54.761 --> 19:56.396
THE ATTENDANCE OF K.'S

19:56.396 --> 19:57.330
PARTY...

19:57.330 --> 19:58.898

20:03.135 --> 20:05.037
KARLIE, AND...

20:05.037 --> 20:08.107
HUSTLING-HER-MAN-DEZ.

20:08.107 --> 20:09.208
SHE WAS VERY PLEASANT.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.444
SHOCKINGLY VERY.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.846
THEN SHE PROCEEDED

20:13.846 --> 20:15.948
TO SAY...

20:15.948 --> 20:17.550
SHE GOT ENGAGED

20:17.550 --> 20:19.452
IN PUERTO RICO.

20:19.452 --> 20:20.920
[laughs]

20:20.920 --> 20:21.988
SHE GOT HIM A RING.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.590
SHE ASKED HIM.

20:23.590 --> 20:26.426
[laughs]

20:26.426 --> 20:27.760
WELL, I HOPE STEVIE IS A BETTER

20:27.760 --> 20:29.061
MAN TO JOSELINE THAN HE WAS

20:29.061 --> 20:30.930
TO ME, BECAUSE OF WHAT I DO

20:30.930 --> 20:32.098
KNOW ABOUT STEVIE,

20:32.098 --> 20:33.833
IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT MAN

20:33.833 --> 20:34.834
IS COMMITTED TO,

20:34.834 --> 20:36.503
IT'S HIS [bleep] AND SOME MONEY

20:36.503 --> 20:37.737
AND NOTHING ELSE.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.171
GOOD LUCK, GIRLFRIEND.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.139
BUT THE THING IS, CLEARLY,

20:40.139 --> 20:41.140
HE SAID YES.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.475
IRONICALLY,

20:42.475 --> 20:44.010
HE SENT ME A TEXT MESSAGE

20:44.010 --> 20:45.845
WHEN THEY WERE OUT THERE

20:45.845 --> 20:47.614
AND SAID, "DON'T BELIEVE

20:47.614 --> 20:49.282
WHATEVER YOU'VE HEARD."

20:49.282 --> 20:50.082
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS

20:50.082 --> 20:50.817
TALKING ABOUT, SO I DIDN'T

20:50.817 --> 20:51.551
RESPOND.

20:51.551 --> 20:52.251
SO HE'S TALKING TO YOU

20:52.251 --> 20:53.820
LIKE Y'ALL ARE TOGETHER STILL.

20:53.820 --> 20:56.188
ALL THE TIME, RIGHT.

20:56.188 --> 20:57.390
THIS THE [bleep] SHE DON'T KNOW,

20:57.390 --> 20:58.591
BUT THAT'S HER BEST FRIEND...

20:58.591 --> 20:59.459
[affecting Jamaican accent]

20:59.459 --> 21:00.226
YOU KNOW HIM AND THAT'S YOUR

21:00.226 --> 21:00.893
MAN.

21:00.893 --> 21:01.728
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE

21:01.728 --> 21:02.595
[bleep] YOUR MAN IS DOING, BOO.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.064
I WAS VERY DUMB AND VERY STUPID

21:05.064 --> 21:06.533
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

21:06.533 --> 21:07.199
AND GUESS WHAT.

21:07.199 --> 21:07.900
SHE'S GOING THROUGH

21:07.900 --> 21:09.135
THE SAME [bleep]

21:09.135 --> 21:09.969
THAT I WAS GOING THROUGH.

21:09.969 --> 21:10.837
ABSOLUTELY.

21:10.837 --> 21:11.704
DO YOU THINK HE GONNA CHANGE?

21:11.704 --> 21:12.705
NO, BOO BOO, HE GONNA DO

21:12.705 --> 21:14.106
THE SAME [bleep] TO YOU.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.509
SO HER PROBLEM NOW, NOT MINE.

21:16.509 --> 21:17.510
YOU WANTED HIM.

21:17.510 --> 21:18.811
GIRLFRIEND, YOU GOT HIM.

YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST GOOD

21:34.761 --> 21:35.962
SEEING JOSELINE BE ABLE

21:35.962 --> 21:38.365

21:51.811 --> 21:52.979
JUST LIKE YOU AND I,

21:52.979 --> 21:53.646
ME AND JOSELINE.

21:53.646 --> 21:54.381
I'MA LET RASHEEDA STAY

21:54.381 --> 21:55.582
WITH SHAWTY LO IN THE STUDIO

21:55.582 --> 21:56.583
SO THEY CAN COLLAB.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.551
AFTER ALL THE [bleep]

21:58.551 --> 22:00.620

22:01.821 --> 22:03.022

22:03.022 --> 22:04.491
ALL IT TOOK WAS TWO GROWN-ASS

22:29.181 --> 22:30.249
SO I WANTED TO SEE IF Y'ALL

22:30.249 --> 22:31.884
COULD DISCUSS YOUR ISSUES

22:31.884 --> 22:32.919

22:32.919 --> 22:33.686
SOMEWHERE.

22:33.686 --> 22:34.754
I DON'T KNOW.

22:34.754 --> 22:35.688
BUT...

22:35.688 --> 22:37.156
I THINK THIS BITCH'S HEAD

22:37.156 --> 22:38.290
IS NOT ON STRAIGHT

22:38.290 --> 22:39.325
OR SHE DONE BUMP [bleep]

22:39.325 --> 22:41.160
OR SOMETHING, BECAUSE ME

22:41.160 --> 22:42.328
BEING PREGNANT, WALKING

22:42.328 --> 22:43.295
INTO A SITUATION WITH K.

22:43.295 --> 22:44.731
MICHELLE, MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT

22:44.731 --> 22:45.665
THING TO DO.

22:45.665 --> 22:46.433
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:46.433 --> 22:47.166
[bleep] IT.

22:47.166 --> 22:48.000
I'M HERE NOW.

22:48.000 --> 22:48.801
LET'S SEE WHAT'S ABOUT

22:48.801 --> 22:52.038
TO GO DOWN.

22:52.038 --> 22:52.972
YOU ALL RIGHT?

22:52.972 --> 22:54.273
YOU GOOD?

22:54.273 --> 22:55.808
TRYING TO HANG IN THERE.

22:55.808 --> 22:57.176
HOW ABOUT YOU?

22:57.176 --> 22:58.310
I'M A'IGHT.

22:58.310 --> 22:59.446
KARLIE WAS LIKE, "RASHEEDA,

22:59.446 --> 23:00.780
RASHEEDA--HOW ABOUT RASHEEDA--

23:00.780 --> 23:01.648
YOU TALK TO RASHEEDA.

23:01.648 --> 23:02.449
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH."

23:02.449 --> 23:03.516
JOSELINE HAS SAID, "HOW ABOUT

23:03.516 --> 23:04.216
YOU TALK TO RASHEEDA?"

23:04.216 --> 23:05.585
MIMI, "WHY DON'T YOU TALK TO

23:05.585 --> 23:07.620
RASHEEDA?"

23:07.620 --> 23:08.821
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS ONE OF THE

23:08.821 --> 23:10.222
BIGGEST STEPS FOR ME,

23:10.222 --> 23:10.923
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE

23:10.923 --> 23:12.058
OUT OF ALL OF THE GIRLS,

23:12.058 --> 23:13.325
YOU HURT ME THE MOST.

23:13.325 --> 23:14.461
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED

23:14.461 --> 23:16.028
WITH ME AND RASHEEDA WAS BECAUSE

23:16.028 --> 23:17.930
I NEVER WOULD EXPECT HER

23:17.930 --> 23:18.865
TO COMMENT ON MY LIFE

23:18.865 --> 23:19.899
THE WAY SHE DID.

23:19.899 --> 23:20.767
I FEEL LIKE YOU COULD NEVER

23:20.767 --> 23:22.602
TELL ANOTHER WOMAN WHAT SHE

23:22.602 --> 23:23.470
BEEN THROUGH.

23:23.470 --> 23:24.904
K., YOU GONNA HEAR

23:24.904 --> 23:26.005
A WHOLE LOT OF STUFF

23:26.005 --> 23:27.073
THAT YOU NOT GONNA LIKE,

23:27.073 --> 23:28.808
BUT YOU CAN'T FIGHT EVERYBODY,

23:28.808 --> 23:29.542
AND EVERYBODY FORMS...

23:29.542 --> 23:30.477
AND YOU SO RIGHT.

23:30.477 --> 23:31.343
THEY OWN OPINION,

23:31.343 --> 23:32.378
AND YOU A STRONG, OPINIONATED

23:32.378 --> 23:33.245
PERSON.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.380
YOU SAY A LOT OF THINGS

23:34.380 --> 23:35.582
TO HURT PEOPLE, K.

23:35.582 --> 23:36.549
I CAN BE VERY HURTFUL.

23:36.549 --> 23:37.684
I MEAN, OFF THE RIP.

23:37.684 --> 23:39.285
I KNOW I CAN BE A BITCH, HON.

23:39.285 --> 23:41.721
I KNOW I CAN BE A BITCH.

23:41.721 --> 23:42.622
BUT SOMETIMES,

23:42.622 --> 23:43.590
I'M JUST BEING FUNNY.

23:43.590 --> 23:44.891
I DON'T EVEN MEAN IT.

23:44.891 --> 23:45.825
I DON'T--I DON'T EVEN--

23:45.825 --> 23:46.659
BUT I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU

23:46.659 --> 23:47.494
NEED TO LEARN FROM,

23:47.494 --> 23:48.294
BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO

23:48.294 --> 23:49.896
UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE TAKE THAT.

23:49.896 --> 23:50.663
EVEN THOUGH ME AND KIRK HAVE

23:50.663 --> 23:51.864
OUR PROBLEMS, EVEN WITH YOU

23:51.864 --> 23:52.799
SAYING A LOT OF STUFF

23:52.799 --> 23:53.733
THAT YOU SAID ABOUT KIRK--

23:53.733 --> 23:54.501
NO, I CAME AT YOU

23:54.501 --> 23:55.167
OUT OF HURT.

23:55.167 --> 23:55.868
I DIDN'T COME AT YOU
