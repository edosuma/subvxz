00:00.699 --> 00:02.366
Over 68 million Americans

00:02.391 --> 00:05.065
leave the safety of
our borders every year.

00:05.132 --> 00:06.600
If danger strikes,

00:06.602 --> 00:09.203
the FBI's International Response Team

00:09.205 --> 00:11.505
is called into action.

00:31.561 --> 00:34.497
Remember how to say "cheese"?

00:34.730 --> 00:36.993
Jibini!

00:38.128 --> 00:40.056
One more time.

00:40.081 --> 00:41.851
Jibini!

00:43.150 --> 00:44.790
Okay, everybody on the train now.

00:44.815 --> 00:45.906
This way, ma'am.

00:53.773 --> 00:56.242
So we're done working at the village?

00:56.267 --> 00:57.699
Yeah.

00:57.853 --> 00:59.371
You gonna miss all the friends you made?

00:59.396 --> 01:01.511
Yeah. They've never
been on a train before.

01:01.536 --> 01:03.223
Well, this one's gonna take all night,

01:03.225 --> 01:05.504
so you better get some sleep.

01:05.529 --> 01:07.761
What about the treat?
Everybody's talking about it.

01:07.763 --> 01:11.198
It's called a retreat. It
means we're done working,

01:11.223 --> 01:14.121
and the rest of our trip
is all about relaxing.

01:14.146 --> 01:16.097
- Sound good?
- Sure, but...

01:16.122 --> 01:18.115
can there also be a real treat?

01:19.542 --> 01:21.425
Let me see what I got in here.

01:21.450 --> 01:24.131
Ooh, looks like someone's been
eating all the fruit snacks.

01:24.365 --> 01:26.313
Let me help you with this.

01:26.315 --> 01:28.082
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:28.084 --> 01:30.751
I saw you push a button,
and the whistle blew.

01:30.753 --> 01:32.115
Would you like to do it next time?

01:32.140 --> 01:34.107
- Can I?
- Of course. Come.

01:34.132 --> 01:36.691
- Thank you, Gervas.
- You're welcome.

01:37.024 --> 01:39.433
- Elijah, Jacob.
- Hey.

01:39.495 --> 01:42.527
Congratulations on uniting
another community, man.

01:42.552 --> 01:44.098
Couldn't have done it without you.

01:44.100 --> 01:46.900
No, thanks, Tumo, but
it... it's your spirit

01:46.902 --> 01:48.773
that gives the others
the confidence to follow.

01:48.798 --> 01:50.679
You are too kind.

01:50.704 --> 01:52.871
And let us know how the water
filtration system works, yeah?

01:52.896 --> 01:54.629
I will.

01:54.654 --> 01:56.354
Well, that's our sign.

01:56.379 --> 01:58.713
Hey, until next time.

02:01.460 --> 02:03.323
Elijah, Jacob,

02:03.348 --> 02:05.612
"God is not unjust.

02:05.637 --> 02:09.066
"He will not forget your work
and the love you have shown him

02:09.091 --> 02:12.471
"as you helped his people
and continue to help them."

02:12.588 --> 02:14.621
It's one of my favorite verses.

02:14.646 --> 02:16.179
Amen, my brother.

02:16.620 --> 02:18.032
Amen.

02:29.749 --> 02:32.980
Raising children requires
patience, kindness,

02:32.982 --> 02:35.060
compassion, responsibility.

02:35.085 --> 02:36.584
The list goes on.

02:36.919 --> 02:40.491
When we practice this,
our kids absorb it.

02:40.516 --> 02:42.116
Leading by example

02:42.141 --> 02:45.676
is the finest and hardest
lesson in raising good people.

02:45.701 --> 02:48.694
Giving oneself to a greater purpose

02:48.731 --> 02:50.230
is a fine model.

02:50.255 --> 02:53.600
We are blessed to have many
members of our congregation

02:53.602 --> 02:57.933
who shoulder an enormous
responsibility to keep us safe.

02:57.958 --> 03:00.215
And they've passed that on.

03:01.711 --> 03:03.778
All right, who's up
for my famous pancakes?

03:03.803 --> 03:05.136
- Me!
- Me, too.

03:05.161 --> 03:06.493
Ryan?

03:06.817 --> 03:08.716
Don't kill me. I have to work.

03:08.718 --> 03:11.067
Oh, come on. On an empty stomach?

03:11.092 --> 03:13.637
You getting on a plane or
are you going to the office?

03:13.662 --> 03:16.367
- The office.
- Well, you can swing by,

03:16.392 --> 03:19.560
and you can have the first batch
and be at your desk by noon.

03:19.562 --> 03:21.195
You sure?

03:21.197 --> 03:23.469
I've seen you on the griddle,
Dad. It takes you a while.

03:23.494 --> 03:24.587
What is it you're always saying?

03:24.612 --> 03:26.243
"You can't rush perfection."

03:26.268 --> 03:29.047
Uh, well, that's true, but
you gotta come by anyway.

03:29.072 --> 03:30.805
Your mom and I don't see you enough.

03:30.830 --> 03:32.056
Done.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.851
Ryan, you wanna race to the car?

03:33.876 --> 03:36.602
Oh, you are on, little brother.

03:36.812 --> 03:38.352
Ready?

03:38.377 --> 03:39.546
Set.

03:39.548 --> 03:41.393
- Go!
- Go, R.J.!

03:44.505 --> 03:47.473
Have you thought about R.J.'s request?

03:47.498 --> 03:49.192
You know I wouldn't
give this my blessing

03:49.217 --> 03:50.416
if I hadn't done the research.

03:50.441 --> 03:52.570
It's a great group and a safe trip.

03:52.595 --> 03:53.961
He's still awfully young,

03:53.963 --> 03:55.763
and the Dominican
Republic is too far away.

03:55.765 --> 03:57.763
How about the other
camp? He loves that place.

03:57.788 --> 04:00.711
When he was little, he did. He's 14.

04:01.020 --> 04:03.871
He wants to volunteer
and make a difference.

04:03.896 --> 04:05.863
He grew up watching you do it.

04:08.737 --> 04:11.204
When's the last time we
had a Sunday at the park?

04:11.463 --> 04:13.096
You know that's a cue
for my phone to ring.

04:13.121 --> 04:16.122
I know. I debated whether
I should say it out loud.

04:18.029 --> 04:19.834
It's a miracle.

04:19.858 --> 04:21.387
Put that down.

04:21.390 --> 04:23.763
Well, we should make
the best of it, huh?

04:24.293 --> 04:26.293
Hey, guys! Who wants
to play hide-and-seek?

04:26.295 --> 04:27.808
- Me, me, me, me!
- Yeah?

04:27.833 --> 04:30.134
Hide-and-seek. Ready?

04:30.159 --> 04:31.363
Go!

04:31.388 --> 04:33.855
To good friends and Sunday brunch.

04:33.880 --> 04:36.621
We haven't done this in a while.
Thanks for making this happen, Monty.

04:36.646 --> 04:38.371
Just meant I had to wake
up at zero dark thirty

04:38.396 --> 04:39.973
for Grandma's Sunday mass,

04:39.975 --> 04:41.775
but I am happy to sacrifice the sleep

04:41.777 --> 04:43.613
if it means I can see
all my ladies in one day.

04:43.638 --> 04:45.171
Aw.

04:45.648 --> 04:47.247
So does that mean you have room

04:47.249 --> 04:49.683
for any other ladies in your life?

04:49.685 --> 04:52.386
Um... depends.

04:52.388 --> 04:54.054
Come on. Spill it, Seger.

04:54.056 --> 04:56.957
Okay, I just met this very sweet girl

04:56.959 --> 04:58.047
who moved into my neighborhood.

04:58.072 --> 05:01.061
I think I may have finally
found someone worthy of you.

05:01.063 --> 05:04.798
Oh. Well, let's make
this a win-win then...

05:05.149 --> 05:07.234
'cause I met this guy at
this comic book convention.

05:07.236 --> 05:09.636
He would be great for
you. Just meet him.

05:09.638 --> 05:11.090
Wow.

05:11.115 --> 05:12.504
Huh.

05:12.552 --> 05:14.098
"Huh" isn't "no."

05:14.123 --> 05:16.215
We're making some progress.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.457
You mean just, like,
for coffee or something.

05:18.482 --> 05:20.949
- Yeah. Yeah, that works.
- This is good.

05:20.974 --> 05:23.625
- My heart's singin'.
- It's just coffee.

05:23.650 --> 05:24.984
Yeah, well, it sounds like

05:25.009 --> 05:26.547
the beginning of a new chapter to me.

05:26.572 --> 05:29.573
Yeah, well, I think it is.

05:29.745 --> 05:31.430
Cheers!

05:41.962 --> 05:45.764
The train for Shinyanga will
be leaving in 10 minutes.

05:45.766 --> 05:48.191
Good morning. We've arrived at Arusha.

05:48.216 --> 05:49.815
Hello?

05:51.238 --> 05:53.438
Anybody here?

06:17.818 --> 06:20.809
We've got 23 missing
Americans in Tanzania.

06:20.834 --> 06:23.986
They're members of the Brunswick
Mission Church in Texas.

06:24.011 --> 06:25.770
They spent a week
volunteering in villages

06:25.795 --> 06:26.948
before they disappeared.

06:26.973 --> 06:29.652
They were last seen en
route to a rural retreat.

06:29.654 --> 06:30.973
Uh, the conductor had eyes on them

06:30.997 --> 06:32.803
about 2:30 in the morning, their time.

06:32.828 --> 06:34.127
Well, that was 12 hours ago.

06:34.152 --> 06:35.606
A lot can happen between now and then.

06:35.631 --> 06:38.027
Have the local police searched
the area where the train stopped?

06:38.052 --> 06:41.035
That's the thing. They didn't stop.

06:41.137 --> 06:44.862
Well, you're... you're saying 23
people vanished from a moving train?

06:44.887 --> 06:46.199
How the hell does that happen?

06:46.201 --> 06:47.901
Yes, but all the employees insisted

06:47.903 --> 06:49.469
there was no stops, no commotion.

06:49.471 --> 06:52.205
- Then what's their explanation?
- The Rapture.

06:52.893 --> 06:56.410
Like... "plucked from the Earth
and taken to Heaven" rapture?

06:56.412 --> 06:58.330
The one and only.

06:58.647 --> 07:00.247
Yeah, well, we have to assume
that it wasn't a miracle

07:00.249 --> 07:01.391
that took these people.

07:01.416 --> 07:03.350
How does an unsub take 23 people?

07:03.352 --> 07:05.886
Well, we can't figure out the
how unless we know the who.

07:05.888 --> 07:07.354
Who has the skills to pull this off?

07:07.356 --> 07:08.622
It'd have to be an organized group

07:08.624 --> 07:09.890
who's done this kind of thing before.

07:09.892 --> 07:11.725
And I bet they're heavily armed.

07:11.727 --> 07:14.227
Well, criminal gangs and
rebels have surged into Tanzania

07:14.229 --> 07:15.629
to escape their own unrest.

07:15.631 --> 07:18.490
I mean, travelers are easy prey.

07:19.443 --> 07:22.002
And once the Americans left
the capital of Dar es Salaam,

07:22.004 --> 07:23.762
the rest of the trip is rural.

07:23.787 --> 07:27.209
Monty, any luck on getting
us the passenger manifest?

07:27.234 --> 07:29.849
No, because most tickets
were purchased in cash.

07:29.874 --> 07:31.243
However, I am trying to figure out

07:31.268 --> 07:33.001
how many more passengers
there were on the train

07:33.002 --> 07:35.202
by going through the background
in social media posts.

07:35.204 --> 07:38.506
The Americans posted these
on their way to the retreat,

07:38.508 --> 07:40.341
before the cellphone service went out.

07:40.343 --> 07:42.109
Do all the missing have
active social media accounts?

07:42.111 --> 07:44.197
No. About half of them. Why?

07:44.222 --> 07:46.752
Because their loved ones are
gonna be expecting an update soon.

07:46.777 --> 07:49.394
Yeah, we should get ahead of
this, reach out to their families.

07:49.419 --> 07:51.118
Monty, we need to control what gets out,

07:51.120 --> 07:52.620
so it's best they come to you.

07:52.622 --> 07:54.606
That's a lot of people.
Maybe the B.A.U. can help.

07:54.665 --> 07:57.135
It's important that they
do not alert the press.

07:57.160 --> 07:59.799
Yeah, if there's a story, organized
unsubs like this will follow,

07:59.824 --> 08:01.043
and they'll be two steps ahead of us.

08:01.068 --> 08:03.440
Both governments have
agreed to wait 24 hours

08:03.465 --> 08:04.957
before releasing a media statement.

08:04.982 --> 08:06.615
Clock starts when you land.

08:06.769 --> 08:09.076
Well, a day doesn't give
us much time to find 'em.

08:09.101 --> 08:10.412
Well, let's hit the ground running.

08:10.437 --> 08:12.326
Local police have started a search,

08:12.351 --> 08:15.873
but the area is so vast, they
need us to help narrow it down.

08:15.979 --> 08:18.612
These people were out to help others.

08:18.614 --> 08:21.482
I'm not about to let
them get punished for it.

08:56.264 --> 08:58.531
A Tanzanian proverb says,

08:58.556 --> 09:01.591
"Little by little, a
little becomes a lot."

09:09.359 --> 09:12.360
- Inspector Polino.
- Unit Chief Garrett.

09:12.362 --> 09:15.564
This is my team... agents
Simmons, Seger, and Jarvis.

09:15.566 --> 09:17.671
Agents, please come this way.

09:17.935 --> 09:20.779
We saw no forced
entry, and it looks like

09:20.804 --> 09:23.960
the belongings of the
Americans are still on board.

09:23.985 --> 09:26.906
We need to speak with the
employees who discovered this.

09:26.931 --> 09:29.665
I hope you get more
out of them than I did.

09:29.913 --> 09:31.326
Are they cooperating?

09:31.351 --> 09:34.018
Yes, just insistent on their beliefs.

09:34.117 --> 09:36.284
But I believe there's
someone responsible.

09:36.286 --> 09:39.554
Does this look like the work of
any militias or rebels around here?

09:39.556 --> 09:41.523
There are legends out there...

09:41.525 --> 09:43.892
men who go beyond just
stealing what they can

09:43.894 --> 09:45.894
and leaving tourists stranded,

09:45.896 --> 09:47.614
ones who want to punish.

09:47.662 --> 09:49.528
Can you lead us to these men?

09:49.530 --> 09:52.465
They are who they are
because we cannot catch them.

09:52.467 --> 09:55.801
They attack and move on. They
are the most dangerous ones.

09:55.803 --> 09:57.927
I understand that, but right
now, they're our best lead,

09:57.952 --> 09:59.091
so we need to track 'em down.

09:59.116 --> 10:00.888
Clara and Mae, you start on victimology

10:00.913 --> 10:02.335
from what's left of the train.

10:02.360 --> 10:03.976
Simmons, you should look at routes

10:03.978 --> 10:06.460
and talk to the conductor
who found the empty car.

10:06.485 --> 10:09.048
Inspector, I'd like to
talk to the search party.

10:09.050 --> 10:10.749
They are gathering here soon.

10:10.751 --> 10:13.519
I also have officers
searching the route,

10:13.521 --> 10:15.121
but they are overwhelmed.

10:15.420 --> 10:19.225
The train traveled overnight,
no stations between.

10:19.227 --> 10:20.732
Where do we begin?

10:20.757 --> 10:23.644
Well, give us an hour.
We'll have a starting point.

10:23.669 --> 10:25.397
Okay, right this way.

10:25.574 --> 10:27.700
Yes, you can send me more photos.

10:27.702 --> 10:29.268
Digital files are fine.

10:29.348 --> 10:30.777
Excuse me.

10:32.607 --> 10:36.444
23 people missing from a train?

10:36.881 --> 10:40.334
- How does that even happen?
- I don't know, but it did.

10:40.359 --> 10:43.082
And now it's everyone's nightmare.

10:43.084 --> 10:44.583
Those families must be a mess.

10:44.608 --> 10:45.695
I mean, at least
they're all in that room

10:45.720 --> 10:48.187
so they can get updates
all the time, but...

10:48.189 --> 10:49.588
there's only 10 of them.

10:49.590 --> 10:51.490
Where's the rest of the family members?

10:51.492 --> 10:53.926
Not all the families
have obvious next of kin.

10:53.928 --> 10:55.227
That's what makes it tricky.

10:55.252 --> 10:57.608
Well, did you check the
next-of-kin database?

10:57.633 --> 11:00.051
- What about NamUs?
- Yes, but there's not much info.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.836
I mean, the missing are a low-key group.

11:01.861 --> 11:04.467
So they kind of fly under
the radar, so it makes sense.

11:04.492 --> 11:06.100
But because we have to
keep this super-contained,

11:06.125 --> 11:09.044
so I can only really share
what I say and to who.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.703
I've been checking social
media for close relatives,

11:11.705 --> 11:13.204
but it seems the only people
who are keeping track of them

11:13.206 --> 11:15.306
were their siblings and parents.

11:15.308 --> 11:16.641
Okay. That's a kick-ass start.

11:16.643 --> 11:18.580
Would I be toe-stepping
if I offered to help?

11:18.605 --> 11:21.246
I could dig into the database dungeon.

11:21.248 --> 11:22.680
I could search for family
members that aren't here.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.901
I could stay with the
ones that are here.

11:23.926 --> 11:26.065
I would love it if you could do both.

11:26.753 --> 11:28.494
I would also love it if
we could clone ourselves.

11:28.519 --> 11:30.155
Right? We need, like, 10 of us.

11:31.332 --> 11:33.065
I would offer up my team,
but they're in Nebraska.

11:33.090 --> 11:35.123
It's fine. If you can
just stay here with them,

11:35.148 --> 11:37.982
then I can go search for
relatives I can trust.

11:38.007 --> 11:40.763
Great. I-I will make tea,
because that always helps.

11:46.359 --> 11:49.017
So the youngest is
Nicholas... 7 years old.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.409
son to single mom Rebecca.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.524
That's brave to bring him all this way.

11:53.549 --> 11:55.594
Well, yeah, but they were
traveling with their church,

11:55.619 --> 11:58.469
so it's essentially an extended family.

11:59.986 --> 12:01.898
That's weird.

12:02.789 --> 12:04.172
What?

12:04.197 --> 12:05.484
If this has anything to do with money,

12:05.509 --> 12:08.289
it's strange that the unsubs
didn't take any of the valuables.

12:08.314 --> 12:10.563
This attack was quick and efficient.

12:10.588 --> 12:11.977
They prioritized.

12:12.002 --> 12:14.547
Maybe they were holding
out for something more,

12:14.572 --> 12:16.205
you know, like ransom.

12:16.230 --> 12:17.430
Yeah.

12:18.425 --> 12:20.656
Also a forensic countermeasure.

12:20.992 --> 12:22.651
There's no reason for
us to track the GPS,

12:22.676 --> 12:24.749
since all their phones are right here.

12:28.014 --> 12:31.114
And like the inspector said,
there's no sign of forced entry.

12:31.781 --> 12:34.415
The only thing is this door.

12:38.289 --> 12:39.903
Looks like it was
jammed from the inside.

12:39.928 --> 12:42.262
Maybe the unsubs were on board.

12:42.896 --> 12:45.800
Yeah, but jumping would have
caused a lot of injuries.

12:46.118 --> 12:49.411
Unless this is an inside job.

12:49.777 --> 12:51.956
Yeah, this would make a lot more sense

12:51.981 --> 12:54.214
if one of the employees was in on it.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.835
Yes, Gervas. And I speak English.

13:01.860 --> 13:03.459
Thank you for helping us.

13:03.850 --> 13:05.819
So were you the last
one to see the Americans?

13:05.844 --> 13:08.178
I did rounds at 2:30.
Everything was fine.

13:08.203 --> 13:09.500
And you arrived here at...

13:09.525 --> 13:11.508
- at 6:30 this morning.
- That's right.

13:11.533 --> 13:13.881
So somewhere in the
span of that four hours,

13:14.070 --> 13:15.791
the 23 Americans disappeared.

13:15.816 --> 13:18.437
Do you know how that happened?

13:20.100 --> 13:22.066
I think it was the Rapture.

13:22.068 --> 13:23.568
They were delivered to Heaven.

13:23.855 --> 13:25.426
You think they were the chosen ones?

13:25.451 --> 13:27.902
- I do.
- But you were not.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.477
It's okay. I have many
responsibilities here.

13:33.681 --> 13:34.980
You have children?

13:35.005 --> 13:36.972
Yes. Do you?

13:36.997 --> 13:39.567
Yeah. Yeah, and I keep thinking about

13:39.592 --> 13:42.987
what those parents are going
through back in the United States.

13:43.905 --> 13:46.546
They should be happy. Their
loved ones are with God.

13:46.571 --> 13:48.405
You cannot prove that.

13:51.574 --> 13:52.959
Listen...

13:53.967 --> 13:57.735
I can't do my job unless
I look at all sides.

13:57.760 --> 14:01.436
The thing is, I do
believe they were chosen,

14:01.461 --> 14:04.128
just not in the same way you believe in.

14:04.153 --> 14:05.986
And whoever took them was watching

14:06.011 --> 14:07.764
and waiting for them to be vulnerable.

14:07.789 --> 14:10.272
I think they're organized,
I think they're patient,

14:10.297 --> 14:13.952
and I also think they needed help
from the inside to pull this off.

14:14.653 --> 14:16.620
Now you're saying the
train never stopped.

14:16.645 --> 14:18.867
- That's correct.
- Well, forgive me for asking,

14:18.892 --> 14:22.116
but if someone were to
threaten your family,

14:22.141 --> 14:24.175
would you do whatever
it took to protect them?

14:24.200 --> 14:25.624
- Of course.
- Would you stop a train

14:25.649 --> 14:27.291
so they could kidnap 23 Americans?

14:27.316 --> 14:29.818
Listen, I swear on my children's
lives that did not happen.

14:29.843 --> 14:31.843
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

14:31.868 --> 14:34.535
Look, if I'm lying, my
children will be damned to hell.

14:34.605 --> 14:36.071
Look, I had nothing to do with this.

14:36.096 --> 14:38.162
I swear to you, I did
not do anything. Please...

14:38.187 --> 14:39.853
Okay, okay, okay.

14:41.615 --> 14:43.381
All right.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.341
I believe you. I need your help.

14:46.366 --> 14:48.119
You've worked this train for years.

14:48.121 --> 14:50.614
- Yes.
- All right.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.858
So there's 400 miles between
when you last saw them

14:53.860 --> 14:55.904
and when you arrived here in Arusha.

14:57.099 --> 14:59.163
Can you show me any terrain
where you may have slowed down,

14:59.165 --> 15:00.717
even a little bit?

15:01.337 --> 15:02.736
Yeah, I can do that.

15:02.761 --> 15:04.303
First of all, I want to thank you all

15:04.328 --> 15:06.452
for volunteering your time.

15:06.477 --> 15:09.078
We believe we're dealing
with a specialized abduction,

15:09.103 --> 15:10.903
requiring many offenders.

15:10.928 --> 15:12.827
They're confident, organized,

15:12.852 --> 15:16.048
and have the means to
hold 23 people hostage.

15:16.073 --> 15:19.875
They likely have access to
encampments, vehicles, and weapons.

15:19.986 --> 15:22.120
We're narrowing down a
starting point for the search

15:22.122 --> 15:24.944
and can begin to canvass
as soon as we confirm.

15:24.969 --> 15:26.869
- Thank you.
- Asante tena.

15:26.894 --> 15:29.186
Guys, we got a possible point of attack.

15:29.211 --> 15:30.514
Let's go.

15:47.914 --> 15:51.549
So the train slowed down
here to get over this trellis.

15:51.615 --> 15:53.618
This could have been the
snatch-and-grab point,

15:53.620 --> 15:56.254
but it's doubtful they kept them here.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.389
There's not much around.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.358
They were definitely exposed.

16:00.897 --> 16:03.124
And look over there.

16:03.149 --> 16:05.155
They must have come down that hill.

16:05.822 --> 16:09.221
The footprints... they
were all scattered.

16:09.312 --> 16:12.913
It would have been chaos,
but they gained control.

16:12.938 --> 16:14.616
Which way did they go?

16:14.641 --> 16:16.503
Guys, I got something here.

16:19.514 --> 16:21.371
It looks like one of the leaders...

16:22.216 --> 16:23.605
Jacob Ross.

16:40.068 --> 16:42.935
They've got eyes on us, up on the ridge.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.985
What do you know about those rebels?

16:45.010 --> 16:47.050
The flag is a Somali rebellion

16:47.075 --> 16:49.909
that's wreaked havoc
all over the continent.

16:49.911 --> 16:52.979
They are at odds with everyone.

16:52.981 --> 16:55.318
If the Americans are held
hostage inside that camp,

16:55.343 --> 16:57.677
I'll lead the negotiation.

16:57.702 --> 16:59.397
I'm not calling in armed forces.

16:59.422 --> 17:01.422
Their presence could
inflame the situation.

17:01.522 --> 17:03.698
Yeah, but we do have
one thing on our side.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.568
In Somali culture,
there's something called...

17:06.895 --> 17:09.362
... which roughly translates
to "fighting while seated."

17:09.364 --> 17:11.137
Those at odds can be civil

17:11.163 --> 17:12.569
unless they're on the battlefield.

17:12.594 --> 17:14.978
Okay, then. Simmons,
Polino, and I will approach.

17:15.002 --> 17:17.597
Clara, you and Mae
lead the search party.

17:17.805 --> 17:20.878
We found one body. There may be more.

17:43.336 --> 17:46.504
_

17:48.026 --> 17:49.659
Who's your leader?

18:06.015 --> 18:08.298
We were litter mates.

18:09.712 --> 18:11.352
Sit.

18:17.733 --> 18:19.233
My name is Jack Garrett.

18:19.258 --> 18:22.483
This is Matt Simmons, and
that's Inspector Polino.

18:23.358 --> 18:26.451
Last night, 23 Americans
were taken off a train,

18:26.506 --> 18:29.041
and one was killed a
quarter-mile from here.

18:29.043 --> 18:31.084
I think you may know who did it.

18:31.855 --> 18:33.822
There are only 12 of us here.

18:34.082 --> 18:36.115
Why would I take more
men than I could control?

18:36.117 --> 18:38.017
It only takes one gun
to control a group.

18:38.019 --> 18:40.350
- I see plenty of those around here.
- I have paid for my weapons.

18:40.375 --> 18:44.147
- By robbing innocent people.
- Those are your words, not mine.

18:48.037 --> 18:50.473
So you found just one dead American

18:50.498 --> 18:52.098
- at the bottom of my hill?
- Yes.

18:52.100 --> 18:55.442
I thought after 9/11, you
people were taught to fight back.

18:55.467 --> 18:58.014
Or are the rest of the missing Americans

18:58.039 --> 19:00.381
just a bunch of cowards?

19:18.939 --> 19:20.739
Keep moving!

19:23.569 --> 19:25.168
Honey, hold on.

19:28.791 --> 19:30.302
Go.

19:36.072 --> 19:38.744
What did you find out up there?
Do they have the Americans?

19:38.769 --> 19:40.523
Well, it wasn't those guys.
I mean, they're horrible,

19:40.548 --> 19:42.692
but they haven't got the
space to hide anyone up there.

19:42.717 --> 19:46.107
And they're not organized
enough for a mass abduction.

19:46.287 --> 19:48.957
- What have you got?
- Looks like Jacob Ross suffered

19:48.982 --> 19:51.662
multiple contusions
from multiple sources.

19:51.687 --> 19:54.504
Put up a hell of a fight. He
has defensive wounds all over.

19:54.529 --> 19:56.062
The C.O.D. is still undetermined,

19:56.064 --> 19:58.297
since I can't properly
examine the corpse out here,

19:58.299 --> 20:00.798
but right now, I'd
say it's a tie between

20:00.823 --> 20:02.723
the blunt force trauma to his skull

20:02.748 --> 20:05.389
or the stab wounds in his abdomen.

20:05.414 --> 20:06.530
Overkill, anyone?

20:06.555 --> 20:07.840
The unsubs may have
taken the whole group,

20:07.842 --> 20:11.043
but I think that the target
of their rage was Jacob.

20:11.045 --> 20:12.378
Well, he and a handful of others

20:12.380 --> 20:13.751
have volunteered in Tanzania before.

20:13.776 --> 20:15.676
- Maybe they made enemies.
- We should look into

20:15.701 --> 20:17.801
their previous trips, see if
there's any other conflicts.

20:17.885 --> 20:19.569
Well, they are organized enough

20:19.594 --> 20:20.920
to plan forensic countermeasures,

20:20.922 --> 20:23.387
like dumping Jacob's body
near the Somali rebel camp.

20:23.412 --> 20:25.057
Well, the overkill tells us
there's a personal connection,

20:25.059 --> 20:26.870
and they want them to be punished.

20:26.895 --> 20:29.730
Killing Jacob is proof that
they mean what they say.

20:29.755 --> 20:32.156
We should also look for secure locations

20:32.158 --> 20:34.124
where they could keep 22 people.

20:34.126 --> 20:36.293
Yeah. Problem is, if they have vehicles,

20:36.295 --> 20:38.723
they could be long gone by now.

20:44.268 --> 20:46.608
Where's Jacob?

20:47.734 --> 20:49.147
When we got off the train,

20:49.172 --> 20:51.585
I saw a bad man

20:51.610 --> 20:53.796
take Elijah and Jacob away.

20:55.008 --> 20:57.142
Did he hurt them?

20:57.144 --> 20:59.981
- Yeah.
- Are they gonna hurt us, too?

21:00.006 --> 21:02.080
Elijah's gonna be okay.

21:02.256 --> 21:03.815
We all will.

21:03.817 --> 21:05.783
Aren't you afraid, too, John?

21:05.785 --> 21:08.501
Of course, but I also have faith.

21:13.126 --> 21:14.734
Since discovering Jacob's body,

21:14.759 --> 21:16.892
I did some digging and
found his wife Sarah.

21:16.894 --> 21:18.327
She filed for divorce about a year ago,

21:18.329 --> 21:19.771
but Jacob never signed the papers.

21:19.796 --> 21:21.296
And that's when I
started doing some digging

21:21.321 --> 21:22.853
and found something interesting.

21:22.878 --> 21:24.825
Jacob doesn't have any personal banking,

21:24.850 --> 21:27.333
but he has opened all of
the mission's accounts.

21:27.358 --> 21:30.559
He's overseen hundreds of
thousands of dollars in goods,

21:30.584 --> 21:32.770
which have been shipped
to Tanzanian projects.

21:32.795 --> 21:34.795
Jacob is the only American
associated with the goodwill.

21:34.820 --> 21:36.186
That could be why he was targeted.

21:36.211 --> 21:37.677
Who's his contact in Tanzania?

21:37.702 --> 21:39.379
Tumo Makani,

21:39.404 --> 21:41.537
the minister of several villages.

21:41.562 --> 21:43.796
Now, Tumo's receipts for goods

21:43.821 --> 21:46.018
don't really match up
with Jacob's waybills.

21:46.056 --> 21:47.150
I think Tumo was stealing.

21:47.175 --> 21:49.942
He's the man between Jacob
and Elijah in this photo.

21:50.861 --> 21:52.541
Keep your friends close...

21:52.566 --> 21:55.300
Tumo's got compounds and
his own volunteers all over,

21:55.325 --> 21:58.059
but there is a spot about 50
miles from your current location.

21:58.084 --> 22:00.197
- Send us the coordinates.
- Done.

22:00.938 --> 22:02.404
He's got a personal
connection to the victim

22:02.406 --> 22:04.940
and the means and
motive to pull this off.

22:04.942 --> 22:06.201
Let's go.

22:12.086 --> 22:13.263
Tumo.

22:40.559 --> 22:42.453
FBI! Freeze!

22:44.615 --> 22:46.492
Tumo, stop!

22:47.910 --> 22:50.644
Uhh! Aah!

22:52.360 --> 22:54.527
Get up! Get up! Up!

22:54.992 --> 22:57.347
What do you know?! Where are they?!

22:57.995 --> 23:00.253
Tumo, where are the Americans?

23:01.607 --> 23:03.580
They are long gone by now.

23:20.269 --> 23:23.269
Where are they taking
us? What are they saying?

23:23.294 --> 23:25.917
He said, "saa nyingine."

23:25.942 --> 23:28.238
I think it means "another hour."

23:29.924 --> 23:31.657
Another hour?

23:31.682 --> 23:34.146
Until what? Until
somebody else gets hurt?

23:34.171 --> 23:36.036
Until they kill us all?

23:43.342 --> 23:45.636
What happened to Jacob Ross?

23:46.063 --> 23:47.663
I last left him on the train.

23:47.665 --> 23:49.636
Jacob's dead, and the
Americans are missing.

23:49.661 --> 23:51.535
Someone took them off.

23:52.056 --> 23:54.757
Where were you and your
men at 2 in the morning?

23:54.782 --> 23:57.234
On our way here. It took all night.

23:57.259 --> 23:58.792
Why'd you run?

24:00.668 --> 24:03.168
Because we took
advantage of the kindness.

24:03.451 --> 24:06.352
We stole from the
shipments. But that's it.

24:08.027 --> 24:11.266
He doesn't leave until we get
some answers. Jack Garrett.

24:11.291 --> 24:13.542
Tumo said that he stole from Jacob,

24:13.567 --> 24:15.601
but this isn't even a
fraction of the supplies

24:15.626 --> 24:17.235
that Jacob sent to Tanzania.

24:17.260 --> 24:19.024
Maybe he's hiding the
rest at another compound.

24:19.049 --> 24:21.015
Or maybe he's just lying.

24:21.765 --> 24:23.336
What's wrong?

24:23.361 --> 24:25.534
Tanzanians want to send in special ops,

24:25.536 --> 24:27.035
which could compromise everything.

24:27.037 --> 24:28.367
The minute they deploy,

24:28.392 --> 24:29.453
the media's gonna be all over it.

24:29.478 --> 24:32.555
- How much time do we have?
- Until midnight.

24:34.221 --> 24:36.821
So it's been a year
since you last saw Jacob?

24:36.846 --> 24:38.679
A little over that, actually.

24:38.704 --> 24:40.871
And you two are not divorced?

24:40.896 --> 24:43.165
Jacob wouldn't betray
his promise to God.

24:43.190 --> 24:44.751
And that's when you
moved in with your sister.

24:44.776 --> 24:45.881
Yes.

24:46.524 --> 24:48.890
Look, I know Jacob was
really involved with

24:48.892 --> 24:51.066
- the Brunswick Mission Church.
- Yeah.

24:51.091 --> 24:52.949
And it seems like him and Elijah Ward

24:52.974 --> 24:54.996
organized the trips to Tanzania.

24:54.998 --> 24:58.660
Yeah. Jacob would
follow Elijah anywhere.

24:59.203 --> 25:01.410
Look, do you have
something I need to sign

25:01.435 --> 25:03.268
or identify Jacob's body?

25:03.293 --> 25:04.660
'Cause I really have to go.

25:05.843 --> 25:08.885
I just need you to answer
a few more of my questions.

25:09.285 --> 25:10.651
Come with me.

25:11.725 --> 25:13.358
When we looked at the things
left behind on the train,

25:13.383 --> 25:16.042
women were the only ones
who had personal items.

25:16.067 --> 25:17.205
The men traveled light.

25:17.230 --> 25:19.290
- That sounds stereotypical.
- Except it gets weirder.

25:19.315 --> 25:21.601
Monty said that he's only
been able to get ahold

25:21.626 --> 25:23.045
of the missing women's families

25:23.070 --> 25:24.454
because they all had
social media accounts.

25:24.479 --> 25:27.280
But none of the men had any
social media presence at all.

25:27.305 --> 25:28.904
Zilch.

25:29.120 --> 25:30.259
Go ahead, Monty.

25:30.284 --> 25:32.311
So Jacob's estranged wife is here,

25:32.336 --> 25:34.556
and she got really anxious
when I mentioned the church

25:34.581 --> 25:36.581
and, more specifically, Elijah Ward.

25:37.071 --> 25:38.853
She said that Jacob would
follow Elijah anywhere

25:38.878 --> 25:42.376
and actually referred to
him as a "loyal subject."

25:42.401 --> 25:44.267
Interesting choice of words.

25:44.292 --> 25:46.559
So they're not the partners
that we thought they were.

25:46.584 --> 25:48.117
Elijah's the leader.

25:48.142 --> 25:50.255
And Jacob was killed
by somebody he knows.

25:50.280 --> 25:51.979
Let's focus on Elijah.

26:05.295 --> 26:07.887
Come, come. Let's go.

26:07.912 --> 26:09.380
This way.

26:09.796 --> 26:10.880
Move.

26:14.008 --> 26:16.927
_

26:16.952 --> 26:18.232
_

26:24.125 --> 26:26.062
Elijah started this devout group,

26:26.087 --> 26:28.256
initiated Jacob as his right hand,

26:28.258 --> 26:30.773
and then 11 more men joined
over the next few years.

26:30.798 --> 26:32.899
Elijah and his 12 disciples.

26:32.924 --> 26:36.148
And then he slowly
recruited nine more women,

26:36.173 --> 26:38.640
including Rebecca Moore,
who brought along her son.

26:38.665 --> 26:40.202
According to their loved ones,

26:40.204 --> 26:42.805
all these women struggled with
abuse and were searching for help.

26:42.830 --> 26:45.070
Which would make them
easier to manipulate.

26:45.095 --> 26:47.529
I think these women were
taken against their will.

26:47.554 --> 26:48.734
They were far from home,

26:48.759 --> 26:51.727
which gives Elijah the ultimate
power and control over them.

26:51.832 --> 26:53.265
They'd be too afraid to revolt.

26:53.290 --> 26:55.090
We were looking in the wrong direction.

26:55.271 --> 26:58.205
- The unsub's on the inside.
- This is a radical cult,

26:58.230 --> 27:00.600
and Elijah is their charismatic leader.

27:00.625 --> 27:02.279
He groomed these women to trust him.

27:02.304 --> 27:04.404
He used their faith against them.

27:05.051 --> 27:07.112
We can't let him get away with this.

27:07.197 --> 27:10.489
So... where would Elijah take them?

27:21.099 --> 27:22.364
John.

27:23.200 --> 27:24.633
What's wrong?

27:24.948 --> 27:26.747
What's going on?

27:26.772 --> 27:28.575
Did you know this was happening?

27:28.600 --> 27:30.133
We couldn't tell everyone.

27:30.310 --> 27:32.243
The mission could have been compromised.

27:32.268 --> 27:34.229
What... mission?

27:34.254 --> 27:37.979
To start over... here, all of us.

27:38.373 --> 27:40.284
You can go now, John.

27:42.583 --> 27:43.982
What is it, Rebecca?

27:44.085 --> 27:46.604
You... tricked us.

27:48.208 --> 27:49.502
No.

27:49.973 --> 27:51.202
I tested you.

27:51.227 --> 27:54.288
How many times have I told you
to stop victimizing yourself?

27:54.313 --> 27:55.569
Now you believe, as I do,

27:55.594 --> 27:58.462
that we all have to go through
hell before we get to Heaven.

27:58.487 --> 28:00.854
You... you told me that
you would do anything

28:00.879 --> 28:02.712
to get away from your hell.

28:02.737 --> 28:05.471
Your bruises may have
healed on the outside,

28:05.747 --> 28:09.072
but inside, you are still
broken and still bleeding.

28:09.097 --> 28:11.634
You need me to help you to be strong

28:11.659 --> 28:13.325
for this young man that you are raising.

28:13.363 --> 28:15.627
You... you'd do anything for him, right?

28:16.133 --> 28:17.994
I would never hurt you,

28:18.019 --> 28:20.048
like his father did.

28:26.743 --> 28:28.872
Don't you have faith, Rebecca?

28:30.009 --> 28:31.709
Yes. Of course I do.

28:31.734 --> 28:34.034
You have to stop letting fear guide you.

28:34.451 --> 28:37.385
What kind of a lesson
is that for Nicholas?

28:44.689 --> 28:46.573
It's beautiful here, son.

28:47.457 --> 28:49.057
You'll see.

28:49.947 --> 28:52.412
Our initial profile was correct.

28:52.436 --> 28:54.050
This is a mission-oriented group,

28:54.075 --> 28:55.948
but Elijah is their leader.

28:55.973 --> 28:58.723
And it took years for him to plan this.

28:58.748 --> 29:00.675
Everything he does,
he does for a reason.

29:00.677 --> 29:03.536
He chose all of these villages.

29:03.561 --> 29:05.465
Do they have any meaning to you?

29:05.490 --> 29:07.723
These spiritual leaders are extremist.

29:07.748 --> 29:10.052
Probably recruited those men
to help set up the commune.

29:10.077 --> 29:13.240
Elijah suffers from a
religious psychopathology

29:13.267 --> 29:15.130
referred to as a "Moses complex."

29:15.155 --> 29:18.223
He doesn't think he's God,
but believes he speaks for him.

29:18.248 --> 29:20.081
And he believes he was chosen by God

29:20.106 --> 29:22.802
to lead his people to the promised land.

29:24.755 --> 29:26.262
We've done it.

29:26.410 --> 29:28.076
Monty just sent this.

29:28.101 --> 29:31.246
"Elijah was born and raised
by a delusional young couple

29:31.271 --> 29:32.910
"who believed that he
could speak to God."

29:32.935 --> 29:35.147
And they named him accordingly.

29:35.172 --> 29:36.389
Elijah was a Hebrew prophet

29:36.414 --> 29:38.381
in both the books of
Kings in the Old Testament.

29:38.406 --> 29:39.553
"His parents were arrested

29:39.578 --> 29:41.974
"for severe abuse of
their other children.

29:41.999 --> 29:44.755
"All were taken away, but
it was too late for Elijah."

29:44.780 --> 29:47.637
He was driven to make his
parents' belief his life's mission.

29:47.662 --> 29:49.095
He wasn't afraid to kill for it.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.427
Jacob's murder unleashed
a homicidal rage.

29:51.452 --> 29:53.753
And if he's showing
signs of euphoric stress,

29:53.778 --> 29:56.041
it could fuel him to take more
risks and hurt more people.

29:56.066 --> 29:57.598
What were his siblings's names?

29:57.623 --> 29:59.289
He was the youngest of eight.

29:59.392 --> 30:01.903
Kids were Ezekiel, Isaac, Ruth,

30:01.928 --> 30:03.995
Caleb, Miriam, Rachel, and Samuel.

30:04.041 --> 30:05.247
Why?

30:05.272 --> 30:07.380
All names from the Old Testament.

30:08.044 --> 30:09.905
It was drilled into his head.

30:09.930 --> 30:11.497
He planned the train ride

30:11.522 --> 30:13.955
to get them close to the Olduvai Gorge.

30:13.980 --> 30:16.942
And historians believe that
is the original Garden of Eden.

30:16.967 --> 30:18.591
I know a shortcut.

30:19.310 --> 30:21.801
The journey started five years ago,

30:22.020 --> 30:24.721
when all of you
brothers and sisters said

30:24.746 --> 30:26.479
that you were lost.

30:26.817 --> 30:29.675
Together, we are found.

30:29.934 --> 30:33.469
Let us bow our heads and
give thanks to our maker,

30:33.721 --> 30:35.898
who has brought us safely

30:36.072 --> 30:37.937
to our new home.

30:37.962 --> 30:40.742
Mama, I don't like this
place. I wanna go home.

30:40.767 --> 30:43.242
I know, baby. It's gonna be okay.

30:46.391 --> 30:48.223
What's the matter?

30:48.783 --> 30:50.450
Are you afraid?

30:50.475 --> 30:51.941
Yes.

30:51.966 --> 30:54.588
Haven't I told you that
fear is for the weak?

30:54.691 --> 30:56.090
Y-yes.

30:56.115 --> 30:58.115
And are you weak, Nicholas?

30:59.561 --> 31:01.012
No.

31:08.749 --> 31:10.248
- Mama!
- Bring him back.

31:10.273 --> 31:12.250
- This needs to end now.
- Nicholas, it's okay.

31:12.275 --> 31:14.414
- Mama, please!
- Hey, Nicholas!

31:14.439 --> 31:16.141
- Elijah!
- Mama!

31:16.166 --> 31:18.266
- Nicholas? Elijah, please.
- Mama!

31:18.291 --> 31:21.485
Elijah, bring him back.
Elijah. Elijah, please.

31:21.874 --> 31:24.074
Elijah, please, don't hurt him.

31:24.099 --> 31:25.266
Elijah, please!

31:25.291 --> 31:27.118
Mama! Mama!

31:27.143 --> 31:28.547
Please, Elijah, don't hurt him!

31:28.572 --> 31:30.899
- Mama, please!
- Elijah, please!

31:30.924 --> 31:32.532
Someone help him!

31:32.557 --> 31:34.039
Elijah, please!

31:34.787 --> 31:37.187
Please! No!

31:39.686 --> 31:41.386
He is delivered

31:41.559 --> 31:44.988
from sin, death, and the Devil.

31:44.991 --> 31:48.606
He has entered our
kingdom here on Earth.

31:49.028 --> 31:50.961
You're home now.

31:51.126 --> 31:52.855
- No need to be afraid anymore.
- Mama!

31:52.880 --> 31:55.481
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.

31:55.483 --> 31:57.049
It's my fault. I'm so...

31:57.051 --> 32:01.887
Let us join in the sacraments
of admission and adoption.

32:01.889 --> 32:05.558
Brothers and sisters, join me.

32:23.978 --> 32:25.359
Jack?

32:31.686 --> 32:33.962
They'll be protective and
convinced we're attacking.

32:33.987 --> 32:35.521
We don't want another Waco.

32:35.523 --> 32:37.979
We go as a peaceful negotiation.

32:41.763 --> 32:44.031
- He is delivered from sin...
- Amen.

32:44.056 --> 32:46.075
... death, and the Devil.

32:46.100 --> 32:49.866
He has entered into our
kingdom here on Earth.

32:49.891 --> 32:51.546
Amen.

32:56.010 --> 32:57.203
Who are you?

32:57.228 --> 33:00.256
My name is Jack Garrett.
I'm with the FBI.

33:00.492 --> 33:03.891
- You don't belong here, Jack.
- Neither do these people.

33:09.157 --> 33:11.724
We are on our own path.
It's not for you to judge.

33:11.859 --> 33:13.536
I'm not judging.

33:14.128 --> 33:17.785
I'm protecting those who
didn't choose to be here.

33:17.810 --> 33:19.912
Every choice that they have made

33:19.937 --> 33:22.201
has brought them to this very spot.

33:22.203 --> 33:24.007
Maybe that's true,

33:25.015 --> 33:28.099
but if anyone's here against
their will, that's against the law.

33:28.124 --> 33:31.273
Brethren, do you recognize Jack?

33:31.979 --> 33:36.145
He is the serpent that
wants us to deny our truth!

33:36.170 --> 33:38.738
I'm only advocating free will.

33:38.793 --> 33:40.684
We both believe in that.

33:41.773 --> 33:43.806
Does anyone want to leave?

33:44.690 --> 33:47.616
No one is in danger here,
but your souls will be

33:47.641 --> 33:50.500
if you run back to
the life that you know,

33:51.032 --> 33:53.165
to darkness,

33:53.167 --> 33:55.274
to demons!

33:55.813 --> 33:58.771
We can start over here.

33:59.069 --> 34:02.364
I have built a safe place for you.

34:02.910 --> 34:06.809
Remember why we left!
This is our destiny!

34:06.834 --> 34:08.246
Don't let them scare you.

34:08.248 --> 34:10.783
God's work is to spread the light,

34:10.784 --> 34:13.119
not hide it away from the world.

34:13.143 --> 34:15.554
Why would you hide everyone away?

34:15.556 --> 34:17.920
Because the world isn't safe.

34:18.493 --> 34:21.199
And it's my fate to help others.

34:21.225 --> 34:22.962
I know how you feel.

34:22.964 --> 34:26.518
Sometimes, I... take a leap of faith.

34:26.543 --> 34:29.400
Other times, I deal with hard facts,

34:29.402 --> 34:31.170
like in this case.

34:31.380 --> 34:33.639
You tricked the women to join you here.

34:33.641 --> 34:35.677
No, I'm saving them

34:35.702 --> 34:37.699
from the abuse that they have suffered.

34:37.724 --> 34:41.147
Have you told anyone what
happened to Jacob Ross?

34:45.197 --> 34:47.230
He was brutally murdered.

34:47.255 --> 34:50.255
It's the way he was killed
that told us the most.

34:50.257 --> 34:51.766
It was personal.

34:53.793 --> 34:56.161
He showed signs of fighting back...

34:56.164 --> 34:59.391
bloody knuckles, skin
under his fingernails.

35:00.071 --> 35:01.766
Who did that to your face?

35:02.503 --> 35:04.236
Why would I kill Jacob?

35:04.238 --> 35:07.147
He threatened your leadership,
and you punished him for it.

35:07.542 --> 35:09.708
Then you sacrificed Jacob

35:09.897 --> 35:13.366
to lead the investigation
away from your paradise.

35:13.714 --> 35:16.215
You're a false prophet and a murderer.

35:16.217 --> 35:19.647
How dare you come in
here and spill those lies?

35:19.672 --> 35:21.787
All you men are trusted disciples.

35:21.789 --> 35:24.541
How much longer before he kills you?

35:26.921 --> 35:28.627
I'm scared.

35:31.245 --> 35:32.877
It's okay. I got you.

35:34.669 --> 35:36.930
Free will, right?

35:40.367 --> 35:42.084
Come on. This way.

35:42.109 --> 35:44.810
Okay. You're safe now. Come on, come on.

35:48.878 --> 35:51.369
You've ruined everything.

35:51.394 --> 35:53.017
Don't you see?

35:54.768 --> 35:57.033
This was their fate.

36:02.530 --> 36:04.015
See if that's yours.

36:04.559 --> 36:07.382
My blood will be on your hands.

36:07.702 --> 36:09.726
You will have sinned.

36:09.751 --> 36:11.936
All you ever wanted
was power and control.

36:11.961 --> 36:13.739
You have that now.

36:15.643 --> 36:18.218
Now go ahead. Be a martyr.

36:18.468 --> 36:21.747
Killing yourself makes you a sinner

36:21.749 --> 36:23.716
in the eyes of your followers,

36:23.741 --> 36:25.656
and you don't want to do that.

36:26.821 --> 36:28.821
Elijah, give me the gun.

36:31.392 --> 36:32.791
Let go of the gun.

36:56.112 --> 36:58.723
Oh, cool. Can I go over there?

36:58.748 --> 37:00.176
Sure.

37:04.714 --> 37:07.793
- Mr. Agent Garrett?
- Hi, Nicholas.

37:07.795 --> 37:09.829
Thanks for saving us.

37:09.854 --> 37:11.864
Well, thanks for being so brave.

37:13.845 --> 37:15.600
I have a question.

37:16.410 --> 37:18.377
Is that your motorcycle?

37:20.641 --> 37:23.175
You see that guy right there?

37:23.177 --> 37:25.567
- He rides this a lot.
- Mm.

37:25.592 --> 37:29.834
And you see Agent Jarvis up
there talking to your mother?

37:30.170 --> 37:32.084
She wants to ride this a lot.

37:32.086 --> 37:33.986
Me, too.

37:35.122 --> 37:37.165
All right, come here.

37:39.752 --> 37:41.376
Okay.

37:41.401 --> 37:42.842
- You like that?
- Yeah.

38:12.693 --> 38:14.326
I saw the news.

38:15.796 --> 38:18.464
I thought you could use
a hug sooner than later.

38:18.466 --> 38:21.302
- Thanks.
- Thank God you found them.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.665
You know, some of them
didn't want to leave.

38:23.690 --> 38:25.815
They devoted their lives to that man.

38:25.940 --> 38:28.243
I have to believe they'll
find a safer place to live.

38:29.833 --> 38:31.573
I saw you guys landed.

38:31.846 --> 38:33.412
- Good job, Dad.
- Thanks.

38:33.414 --> 38:35.930
- Are you headed off?
- Mm.

38:35.955 --> 38:37.776
Like father, like son?

38:38.018 --> 38:40.680
I guess this case means
R.J. doesn't stand a chance

38:40.705 --> 38:42.221
for his Dominican Republic trip.

38:42.246 --> 38:43.768
He hit you up, too?

38:43.793 --> 38:45.701
Yeah. For what it's worth,

38:45.726 --> 38:48.837
he is way more driven
than I was at his age,

38:48.862 --> 38:50.496
and he is a smart kid.

38:50.498 --> 38:52.264
Yeah, I know.

38:52.289 --> 38:55.384
Guess I have, uh, have to
have a little more faith

38:55.409 --> 38:57.260
that he'll be all right.

38:58.182 --> 38:59.776
Is that a "yes"?

38:59.801 --> 39:01.401
He's brave. I'm the one who's scared,

39:01.426 --> 39:03.826
so I can't let that get in his way.

39:05.830 --> 39:07.385
Nice, Dad.

39:07.410 --> 39:09.143
He's gonna be stoked.

39:13.098 --> 39:14.430
Did you two make calls?

39:14.455 --> 39:16.588
You have connections in
the Dominican Republic.

39:16.613 --> 39:18.079
Yeah.

39:19.762 --> 39:21.440
Well...

39:22.080 --> 39:23.513
we know a few guys.
