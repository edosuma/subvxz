00:04.305 --> 00:06.105
¶ ¶

00:06.107 --> 00:08.140
-(cameras snapping)
-Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:08.141 --> 00:10.142
Eh, eh, eh!
(laughing)

00:10.144 --> 00:11.643
I know this is
a student film festival

00:11.645 --> 00:13.145
in the school cafeteria, but...

00:13.147 --> 00:15.381
I feel like I'm walking
a real Hollywood red carpet.

00:15.383 --> 00:17.816
Yeah, except on real
Hollywood red carpets,

00:17.818 --> 00:19.184
you don't see
a lot of hairnets.

00:19.186 --> 00:21.020
(crowd murmuring)

00:21.022 --> 00:24.056
Yo, Marge!
Your fish sticks
were tight today!

00:26.193 --> 00:27.126
(laughs)

00:27.128 --> 00:29.461
Oh wow, this
is so exciting!

00:29.463 --> 00:32.698
-Levi, honey,
I'm so proud of you. Oh!
-(cameras snapping)

00:32.700 --> 00:34.800
Are we gonna be
in a magazine?

00:34.802 --> 00:36.168
Probably the school
newspaper.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.137
"The Peanut Post"?
Like, the front page?

00:38.139 --> 00:41.807
Well, since "The Peanut Post"
is only one page... yeah.

00:41.809 --> 00:44.543
Oh, well then, Levi,
get out my shot, okay?

00:44.545 --> 00:46.345
(cameras snapping)

00:46.347 --> 00:48.213
Well, this is it, family.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.982
First stop, cafeteria.

00:49.984 --> 00:52.317
Next stop, Sundance!

00:52.319 --> 00:55.154
-(tapping, feedback)
-This thing on? Oh!

00:55.156 --> 00:56.355
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:56.357 --> 00:58.190
if you'll kindly
take your seats,

00:58.192 --> 01:00.192
the Carver Cannes
Film Festival

01:00.194 --> 01:01.727
will begin with
a documentary

01:01.729 --> 01:03.829
-by Levi Grayson.
-(applause)

01:03.831 --> 01:05.697
(cheering)

01:05.699 --> 01:08.133
Levi, would you like to come up
and introduce your film?

01:10.938 --> 01:13.172
(whooshing)

01:13.174 --> 01:16.275
(crowd booing)

01:16.277 --> 01:17.443
(whooshing)

01:21.182 --> 01:22.514
Uh-oh.

01:22.516 --> 01:23.749
I think my little
brother's dream

01:23.751 --> 01:25.284
is about to become a nightmare.

01:25.286 --> 01:28.020
Style.
Who determines it?

01:28.022 --> 01:30.956
Your mom, your peers, or you?

01:30.958 --> 01:34.226
What starts as
a lighthearted documentary

01:34.228 --> 01:36.095
becomes so much more in...

01:36.097 --> 01:39.198
-"Dress to Express."
-(cheering)

01:39.200 --> 01:40.299
<i> ¶ Ohhhh ¶</i>

Yep! That's us.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.750
¶ ¶

02:31.752 --> 02:33.819
<i>I thought of starting</i>
<i>my documentary</i>

02:33.821 --> 02:35.754
<i>by following my</i>
<i>big brother Booker,</i>

02:35.756 --> 02:37.256
<i>since he has</i>
<i>tons of style.</i>

02:37.258 --> 02:38.757
<i> Turns out,</i>

02:38.759 --> 02:41.793
<i> someone was about</i>
<i> to cramp his style.</i>

02:41.795 --> 02:44.096
<i> Mom, I told you I'm never</i>
<i> going to wear that!</i>

02:44.098 --> 02:45.831
<i> -Never?</i>
<i> -Never, never--</i>

02:45.833 --> 02:46.832
-(gasp)
-Ever, ever!

02:46.834 --> 02:48.100
-(gasp)
-Never, never--

02:48.102 --> 02:50.769
-(groan)
-Am I going to wear that, ever!

02:50.771 --> 02:52.838
(growling)

02:53.941 --> 02:56.575
Booker, you used to love
my Ravenous designs.

02:56.577 --> 02:59.111
Because your mother
is a fashion designer

02:59.113 --> 03:01.280
of children's haute couture!

03:02.149 --> 03:04.683
Exactly, Mom! They're for kids.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.185
I've outgrown that stuff.

03:06.187 --> 03:09.254
Well, this "stuff"
pays the bills.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.623
Sometimes.

03:11.625 --> 03:14.459
Look, Mom,
Dad sent me and Nia
some shopping money,

03:14.461 --> 03:16.628
so I just wanna pick out
my own clothes.

03:16.630 --> 03:19.364
Just try it on, Booker.
You would look so cute!

03:19.366 --> 03:20.499
Look at that.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.734
Th-that's the thing, Mom.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.369
I don't wanna look cute.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.604
I'm not a baby anymore.

03:25.606 --> 03:29.241
But, uh, tomorrow,
can you make us those
smiley face pancakes?

03:29.243 --> 03:31.043
-Do you want sprinkles?
-Oh, I love the sprinkles.

03:31.045 --> 03:33.078
-You know I made some homemade
whipped cream for you.
-Oh, yes!

03:33.080 --> 03:35.147
You know I did!
Just try it on.

03:35.149 --> 03:36.548
-No, Mom.
-Booker, just try it on!

03:36.550 --> 03:39.885
Listen, I respect Booker.
I do.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.153
But, fashion?

03:41.155 --> 03:44.156
It's my business.
I know what's best.

03:44.158 --> 03:46.091
So, I got this, America.

03:46.093 --> 03:48.260
¶ ¶

03:51.265 --> 03:53.065
-(door shuts)
-Hey, ladies.

03:53.067 --> 03:54.499
(both sigh)

03:56.036 --> 03:58.503
Wow. The double plop down.

03:58.505 --> 04:00.405
Which boy left what boy band?

04:01.008 --> 04:02.241
(sigh) I got rejected from

04:02.243 --> 04:04.276
the Conservation
and Clean-Up Crew.

04:04.278 --> 04:05.210
Oh, what do they do?

04:05.212 --> 04:07.212
-They sort garbage.
-Ew.

04:07.214 --> 04:09.414
-Prepare compost.
Fertilize plants--
-Ew.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.782
That's nasty.

04:10.784 --> 04:14.253
I wanna clean.
I wanna clean up so bad, Mom.

04:14.255 --> 04:17.255
Well, your room is screaming,
"I need to be cleaned.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.324
I need to be
cleaned so bad!"

04:20.261 --> 04:22.261
Just wait for your
turn on that club.

04:22.263 --> 04:24.863
They just accepted
Clarissa Kaywood today,

04:24.865 --> 04:26.431
and she applied
the same time as me.

04:27.301 --> 04:28.233
Ah.

04:28.235 --> 04:30.102
The ugly side of being fly.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.137
What's that
supposed to mean?

04:32.139 --> 04:33.905
Well, maybe they're judging you

04:33.907 --> 04:35.941
for how you look
and what you wear.

04:35.943 --> 04:39.111
I mean, Clarissa did live on
a farm before she moved here,

04:39.113 --> 04:40.812
and she still kinda
dresses that way.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.981
In flannel shirts,
jeans, work boots.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.884
Yeah. I love the way she
always smells like fresh milk.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.452
I know, it makes me
always want cookies!

04:47.454 --> 04:48.620
-Yeah, right?
-(laugh)

04:48.622 --> 04:50.555
But, she dresses
like everyone else

04:50.557 --> 04:51.957
in that club when
you think about it.

04:53.227 --> 04:54.559
You're right.

04:54.561 --> 04:57.629
I'll dress the part,
and I'll show them
how good I am.

04:57.631 --> 05:01.066
Yeah, this is great.
I'm just gonna have
to dress down.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.167
I can help you with that

05:02.169 --> 05:04.102
if you help me with
my Cotillion class.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.304
(laughing)

05:05.306 --> 05:07.472
Tess, why are you taking
a Cotillion class?

05:07.474 --> 05:08.974
Because it's
an "elective,"

05:08.976 --> 05:10.475
and my mom elected
that I take it.

05:10.477 --> 05:13.211
"To learn you some manners
and how to act real classy."

05:14.114 --> 05:15.147
What do you have to do?

05:15.149 --> 05:17.182
Well, they teach us
table etiquette,

05:17.184 --> 05:19.851
manners, ballroom dancing,
and how to give a toast.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.586
Oh, that doesn't
sound so bad.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.855
Well, I've got a test
coming up at the High Tea,

05:23.857 --> 05:26.491
and I've gotta do it in
a dress and high heels.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.927
But, if I pass,
my mom's gonna let me go

05:28.929 --> 05:31.997
to the L-Train
basketball camp.
Choo-choo!

05:33.534 --> 05:36.635
Look, everyone! Oh!
My diploma's here.

05:36.637 --> 05:40.105
Oh, it's official!
I am now a certified...

05:40.107 --> 05:42.307
"Get A Life" life coach!
(laughing)

05:42.309 --> 05:43.942
What else is here... (gasp)

05:43.944 --> 05:46.578
I even get my own whistle!
(whistling)

05:46.580 --> 05:49.147
Looking good out there!
(whistling)

05:49.149 --> 05:52.117
Nice work! Yeah, yeah!
(whistling)

05:52.119 --> 05:54.119
Excellent hustle!

05:55.289 --> 05:57.322
(all sigh)

05:57.324 --> 05:59.758
Hey, I guess I picked
the right week
to start life coaching.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.127
Put me in, Coach! Oh.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.096
Wait, I'm the coach. Yeah!

06:06.800 --> 06:08.200
¶ ¶

06:08.202 --> 06:11.503
While Nia and Tess were
changing their styles,

06:11.505 --> 06:13.972
Booker was finding his online.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.475
Oh, biker knee jeans?

06:16.477 --> 06:18.477
(laugh) Click!

06:18.479 --> 06:21.079
Oh? Those wind pants are lit!

06:21.081 --> 06:24.149
I know you're camouflaged,
but I see you. Hey!

06:27.087 --> 06:28.253
Booker,

06:28.255 --> 06:30.088
I was looking for
fabric swatches,

06:30.090 --> 06:31.256
and...

06:31.258 --> 06:33.992
I found this inside
of the old trunk.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.227
Mom, you show me
that every time

06:35.229 --> 06:36.428
you're looking
for swatches.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.096
Booker,

06:38.098 --> 06:39.431
your little human
head used to fit

06:39.433 --> 06:40.632
inside of this
little hat!

06:41.869 --> 06:42.934
What are you doing?

06:46.073 --> 06:48.206
Throne Threads?
Really?

06:48.208 --> 06:51.243
The streetwear
site with all the--
the swaggy swag?

06:51.245 --> 06:52.611
If you wanted to dress
like a prince,

06:52.613 --> 06:54.780
you shoulda come
to the queen, honey.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.982
Mom, they've got some
really dope stuff on there.

06:57.284 --> 06:58.550
Mm-hmm.

06:58.552 --> 06:59.985
-(click)
-Remove.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.622
-Remove.
-(click)

07:03.624 --> 07:06.258
Mom, Nia and I are 13.
We can pick out our own clothes.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.926
No, no, no. Nia is
not the problem here.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.394
She gets her
taste from me.

07:09.396 --> 07:10.862
You get your taste
from your daddy.

07:10.864 --> 07:11.930
Suspect.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.800
Remove. Re-- ew.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.201
Remov-- Ooh!

07:16.203 --> 07:19.271
Now, that is cute.
That's a pea coat. Click!

07:19.273 --> 07:20.705
A pea coat?

07:21.308 --> 07:23.308
Wow, Mom,
why stop there?

07:23.310 --> 07:24.876
Maybe you can find
a whole sailor suit.

07:24.878 --> 07:28.747
-No, no, no.
-You would look so cute
in a sailor suit!

07:28.749 --> 07:30.148
S-A-I-L--

07:30.150 --> 07:31.416
Mom, stop, stop!

07:31.418 --> 07:32.818
I'm old enough to dress myself.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.553
Sweetheart, listen,
I'm your mom, all right?

07:34.555 --> 07:37.222
And I know what's best
for you. I made you.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.557
And because I'm a...

07:38.559 --> 07:41.626
Fashion designer of
children's haute couture!

07:42.629 --> 07:44.563
I know, I know, Mom.

07:44.565 --> 07:45.997
But you, Mommy,

07:45.999 --> 07:48.066
are killing my game!

07:49.436 --> 07:51.303
I know my mom loves me, but...

07:51.305 --> 07:53.972
sometimes, I feel like
she doesn't really see me.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.640
All she sees is this.

08:01.248 --> 08:04.216
¶ ¶

08:07.287 --> 08:09.287
Hey, Sienna. I know
we have a science test,

08:09.289 --> 08:11.323
but I don't think
that's what they mean

08:11.325 --> 08:13.124
by knowing all the answers

08:13.126 --> 08:14.693
off the top of your head.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.795
(laughing)

08:16.797 --> 08:18.129
-Funny, Nia.
-Why, thank you.

08:18.131 --> 08:20.332
But I'm practicing
my posture for
the Carver Cotillion.

08:20.334 --> 08:21.233
Oh.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.269
Wow, you look so...

08:24.938 --> 08:26.538
farm fabulous.

08:27.441 --> 08:29.307
This is why I love my job.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.543
These kids always surprise you.

08:31.545 --> 08:34.179
When Nia changed her
entire look, I was like,

08:34.181 --> 08:37.282
"Whoa!"
Or as the kids here say,

08:37.284 --> 08:38.917
"wowza."

08:38.919 --> 08:42.320
Levi:
I've never heard
a kid say that.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.456
Oh, they definitely say that.

08:44.458 --> 08:47.392
I wouldn't make up some
slang and pass it off

08:47.394 --> 08:50.896
as something cool the kids
here are saying. (laughing)

08:50.898 --> 08:53.365
That would be very sad.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.102
One, t--

08:57.838 --> 09:00.305
One, t--
Bruh, I'm leading!

09:03.210 --> 09:06.144
Compost.
Compost.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.178
Not compost.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.547
Honestly, Clarissa,

09:08.549 --> 09:11.249
it's like you weren't
even born in a barn.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.085
Hey, Delaney.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.821
How can I help the founder,
and president,

09:16.823 --> 09:18.290
of the Conservation Crew today?

09:18.292 --> 09:20.325
You can't. Now, go away.

09:20.327 --> 09:21.860
I'm saving the Earth right now.

09:21.862 --> 09:24.696
But, I can help.
I'm dressed for it.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.831
No, you're in costume.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.867
I mean, you're not serious
about saving the Earth.

09:28.869 --> 09:29.901
You're a poser.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.737
A poser? But,
how could you say that?

09:32.739 --> 09:35.340
It's written all over
your brand new clothes.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.409

(<i> gasp)</i>

09:53.560 --> 09:56.194
Hey! (giggling)

09:56.196 --> 09:59.397
No need to take your bare
head to Throne Threads,

09:59.399 --> 10:01.900
all right?
Isn't that cute? Ooh!
And I got more.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.401
Look!

10:03.403 --> 10:04.903
Where'd you get
that coat from?

10:04.905 --> 10:07.172
Did Charles Barkley
leave it in your Scut?

10:07.174 --> 10:09.708
No, I got it from a store.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.910
Oh, where?
In the Shaquille O'Neal section?

10:11.912 --> 10:13.878
-(laughing) 'Cause he--
-Booker.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.313
You will grow into it.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.315
All right? I paid a lot
of money for this.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.984
Well, I wanted to pay
a lot of money for it.

10:18.986 --> 10:21.186
Oh, you still can. 29.99.

10:23.256 --> 10:25.857
(indistinct mumbling)

10:25.859 --> 10:28.093
Oh, it looks like your daddy's
money disappeared, huh?

10:28.095 --> 10:29.494
Put it on.

10:32.566 --> 10:34.299
(gasp)

10:34.835 --> 10:36.167
Now, that...

10:36.169 --> 10:39.237
is a throne of threads.
I love that! All right!

10:39.239 --> 10:41.072
You look so cute!
Let me go get a picture!

10:41.074 --> 10:42.907
Doesn't he look adorable?
I'm gonna get my camera!

10:42.909 --> 10:43.942
Yeah, adorable!

10:43.944 --> 10:45.176
You look adorable!

10:45.178 --> 10:47.946
You look miserable.

10:47.948 --> 10:50.015
I just wanna pick out
my own clothes.

10:50.017 --> 10:52.250
Yeah. Your mom's not
hearing you, huh?

10:53.286 --> 10:55.520
Hey, maybe
I can help, huh?

10:55.522 --> 10:58.757
As a recently
certified life coach,

10:58.759 --> 11:00.925
I have a unique perspective.

11:00.927 --> 11:03.862
I can help. I've even
started my own business.

11:03.864 --> 11:06.331
C-O-U-C-H.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.000
Couch. (chuckle)
That's, um,

11:09.002 --> 11:11.336
"Chelsea Offering Up
Chelsea's Help."

11:11.338 --> 11:14.139
-(laugh) How am I doing, honey?
-Levi: Catchy, Mom.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.174
Oh, thank you, baby! (laugh)

11:16.176 --> 11:19.244
My mission, if I choose
to accept it...

11:19.246 --> 11:21.312
which I do, ha,

11:21.314 --> 11:23.381
is to help everyone
with their struggle

11:23.383 --> 11:26.117
to express themselves.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.920
And I've already found
my first clients.

11:28.922 --> 11:33.124
Okay. We just need to
take a deep breath,

11:33.126 --> 11:34.626
and hear each
other out, all right?

11:34.628 --> 11:35.894
In through the nose.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.195
(all inhale)

11:37.197 --> 11:38.530
Good. Out through the mouth...

11:38.532 --> 11:40.865
-(indistinct shouting)
-Okay!

11:42.235 --> 11:45.637
Since you're both having
trouble hearing each other,

11:45.639 --> 11:48.373
I want you to make
vision boards.
Okay, Booker!

11:48.375 --> 11:50.575
You make a board
showing how you think

11:50.577 --> 11:52.577
your mom sees you, right?

11:52.579 --> 11:55.080
-And Rae--
-Mm-hmm...

11:55.082 --> 11:59.084
You make a board showing
how you actually see Booker.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.152
Right? And when you're
both done, you know,

12:01.154 --> 12:03.588
maybe you'll come to some
sort of understanding.

12:03.590 --> 12:06.591
This sounds like
a lot of life coach
mumbo-jumbo to me.

12:06.593 --> 12:08.193
Oh, Rae! Oh...

12:08.195 --> 12:10.395
That means
so much to me.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.330
Thank you.

12:12.332 --> 12:16.067
¶ ¶

12:16.503 --> 12:17.969
Hey, Nia, I--

12:20.440 --> 12:23.174
What the Freaky Friday
is going on in here?

12:23.176 --> 12:25.043
Uh, Nia let me
borrow her dress

12:25.045 --> 12:26.444
for the Cotillion,
Ms. B, and...

12:26.446 --> 12:29.781
these high heels that I will
never be able to walk in.

12:29.783 --> 12:32.383
Nia, why are you dressed
like a '90s indie rock band

12:32.385 --> 12:33.852
from Portland?

12:33.854 --> 12:36.421
Mom, I'm trying to be part
of the Conservation Crew,

12:36.423 --> 12:38.590
but the president
thinks I'm a poser.

12:38.592 --> 12:41.059
Well, you kinda
are posing,

12:41.061 --> 12:42.594
Nia, 'cause
this isn't you.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.229
You know, you don't
have to change

12:44.231 --> 12:45.864
the way you dress just
to impress someone,

12:45.866 --> 12:46.798
and neither
do you, Tess.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.266
You've always been
your own individual,

12:48.268 --> 12:50.301
but you shoulda come
to me for a dress.

12:50.303 --> 12:51.569
Why, Ms. B?

12:51.571 --> 12:55.340
Because I'm a fashion designer
of children's haute couture!

12:57.811 --> 13:00.311
No, Mom, we're not
trying to impress anyone.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.280
Nia, you are a born leader.
You wouldn't even let Booker

13:02.282 --> 13:04.716
beat you into this world.
You were leading then,

13:04.718 --> 13:06.217
and you've been
leading ever since.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.385
Mom, I just
wanna fit in

13:07.387 --> 13:09.154
so I can be a part
of this club.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.321
You should really
listen to yourself

13:10.323 --> 13:12.190
'cause that's
follower talk. You, too--

13:13.293 --> 13:14.292
What!

13:14.294 --> 13:16.294
-Get your friend!
-Okay, okay!

13:16.296 --> 13:18.797
Hey, you guys got about
$10 in quarters down here.

13:18.799 --> 13:19.864
What?!

13:22.135 --> 13:24.169
¶ ¶

13:24.171 --> 13:25.970
All right,
on the count of three,

13:25.972 --> 13:29.007
reveal those vision boards!
One...

13:29.009 --> 13:30.508
Two-- Rae!

13:30.510 --> 13:32.277
(whistling)
Out of bounds!

13:32.279 --> 13:35.680
Whoa,
whoa! Chels, are you
a-a-a coach or a referee?

13:35.682 --> 13:37.849
(whistling)
I'm asking the questions,
all right!?

13:37.851 --> 13:39.350
Go to the penalty box!

13:39.352 --> 13:40.385
What?

13:41.822 --> 13:44.155
Just... Just sit on the couch.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.259
All right, Booker,
it's your turn
to reveal your board.

13:48.261 --> 13:51.329
All right. This is
how my mom sees me.

13:53.300 --> 13:56.167
Oh. Oh,
it's a blank canvas,

13:56.169 --> 13:59.871
full of potential
and unrealized possibilities.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.673
Wow, Booker, that is beautiful.

14:01.675 --> 14:05.176
No, no, no.
I mean, she doesn't see
or listen to me.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.145
Oh, okay. Rae,

14:07.147 --> 14:08.880
did you hear what
Booker just said?

14:09.683 --> 14:11.149
Oh, sorry. I was, uh...

14:11.151 --> 14:14.185
I was thinking I shoulda put
Idris Elba on this board.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.387
Now, that's a man.

14:17.123 --> 14:19.290
You know what? Forget it.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.125
Oh, Booker...

14:21.127 --> 14:23.461
-Really, what did I say?
-Rae, did you even understand

14:23.463 --> 14:25.296
what Booker was
trying to tell you?

14:25.298 --> 14:28.266
He's growing up and he
doesn't think you see it.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.002
Do you see it?

14:31.004 --> 14:33.204
He's always been
my little baby boy.

14:33.573 --> 14:34.439
Yeah.

14:34.441 --> 14:37.208
You remember when
the twins were born, Chels.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.711
How easily Nia just stepped out?

14:39.713 --> 14:41.813
Yeah. Yeah, she was
right on schedule.

14:41.815 --> 14:43.248
You know, she even tried to

14:43.250 --> 14:45.049
snap her own
umbilical cord.

14:45.051 --> 14:47.218
-Ooh, that girl was strong!
-Yeah!

14:47.220 --> 14:48.086
Yeah.

14:49.089 --> 14:52.056
And full of determination.
But, Booker?

14:52.058 --> 14:55.827
Booker's complications kept
him in the incubator for...

14:55.829 --> 14:57.729
-two weeks.
-I remember.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.330
And even though he's
getting older, and...

15:00.066 --> 15:02.500
smells worse
every single day.

15:02.502 --> 15:03.635
Yeah...

15:07.274 --> 15:08.706
I can't help thinking
about the little boy

15:08.708 --> 15:10.909
who was in the incubator
that I had to take care of.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.181
Listen, I know he
thinks he's old enough

15:17.183 --> 15:18.249
to make his own decisions,

15:18.251 --> 15:19.851
but I'm just not
ready for that yet.

15:20.720 --> 15:21.786
I know.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.856
But, kids don't wait
until we're ready.

15:24.858 --> 15:26.958
You know?
They just...

15:26.960 --> 15:28.459
they grow up.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.530
I guess I can let go
a little bit.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.198
-Yeah, a little. Little.
-Just a little.

15:35.568 --> 15:38.269
Wow, Chels,
you're really good
at this life coach thing.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.138
Yeah? Oh, thank you!

15:40.140 --> 15:41.839
(giggling)

15:42.442 --> 15:43.541
Now, um,

15:43.543 --> 15:46.210
how much would you pay me
for that session?

15:46.212 --> 15:48.212
I'm just trying to get
a good idea of my rates.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.481
What?

15:50.483 --> 15:53.384
After Nia got done
icing Tess's face

15:53.386 --> 15:55.987
from her high-heeled
fall from grace,

15:55.989 --> 15:59.257
she thought long and hard
about what her mom said.

15:59.259 --> 16:01.292
And she did what
she always does.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.994
She took action.

16:02.996 --> 16:04.262
Join YOU-nity,

16:04.264 --> 16:05.830
the new group for
Carver students

16:05.832 --> 16:09.000
who wanna preserve and beautify
their environments.

16:09.002 --> 16:10.234
What's going on here?

16:10.236 --> 16:13.571
Well, you won't let me
join the Conservation Crew,

16:13.573 --> 16:15.606
so I'm starting my own club.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.575
Where everyone is welcome.

16:17.577 --> 16:21.346
Actually, I am almost at
the 50 signatures I need.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.614
Do you believe you
can change the world,

16:23.616 --> 16:24.816
just the way you are?

16:24.818 --> 16:27.318
(scoff) Everyone
knows you're a poser.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.287
No, Delaney.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.689
I'm a bold, fashionable woman

16:31.691 --> 16:34.092
who's gonna go to college
for environmental science,

16:34.094 --> 16:36.294
and then I'm gonna go
to a master's program

16:36.296 --> 16:39.263
for fashion marketing,
and then I'm gonna get my PhD

16:39.265 --> 16:41.499
in environmental fashion,
and guess what, Delaney?

16:41.501 --> 16:43.868
You're gonna be in school
for, like, 100 years?

16:43.870 --> 16:45.236
Yes.

16:45.238 --> 16:48.106
And then I'm gonna
change the world.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.775
And I am gonna look
amazing doing it.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.378
You, too, Clarissa?

16:53.380 --> 16:55.513
Actually, Clarissa was

16:55.515 --> 16:57.815
the last of your crew to sign.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.283
Everyone else is
already on the list.

16:59.285 --> 17:00.885
Why is this happening?

17:00.887 --> 17:03.287
Because, Delaney,

17:03.289 --> 17:05.289
you know how to treat
the environment,

17:05.290 --> 17:07.258
but you judge people
based on how they look.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.861
And you can't change
the world like that.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.295
But,

17:11.297 --> 17:13.865
you can if you join my club.

17:15.502 --> 17:16.901
(sigh)

17:16.903 --> 17:18.301
¶ ¶

17:19.839 --> 17:22.973
I love watching
the development of a leader.

17:22.976 --> 17:25.877
The metamorphosis from
caterpillar to butterfly.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.579
From peanut to peanut butter.

17:28.581 --> 17:31.149
Nia is so inspiring.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.251
Go Peanuts!

17:33.253 --> 17:36.287
¶ ¶

17:37.524 --> 17:39.590
(indistinct chatter)

17:43.830 --> 17:45.096
All right, everyone.

17:45.098 --> 17:46.431
I'll be coming around
to give you marks

17:46.433 --> 17:48.099
on everything we've
learned for Cotillion,

17:48.101 --> 17:50.068
before we finish up our toasts.

17:51.337 --> 17:54.072
Posture check.
Shoulders back,

17:54.074 --> 17:55.473
chin up.

17:56.342 --> 17:57.909
Very good, Sienna.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.410
I know, right?

17:59.412 --> 18:03.014
That's a deduction for
a rhetorical question.

18:03.016 --> 18:04.115
Don't phrase it
as a question

18:04.117 --> 18:06.017
unless you're waiting
for an answer.

18:06.019 --> 18:08.252
Are you serious?!

18:08.254 --> 18:10.354
I'm gonna walk away before
you fail our class. Okay.

18:12.025 --> 18:13.591
Etiquette check.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.461
Are you eating
shrimp cocktail?

18:17.230 --> 18:19.063
You need a salad fork.

18:19.065 --> 18:20.431
Excellent, Tess.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.434
You know that little fork
can double as a screwdriver?

18:23.436 --> 18:25.503
(laughing)
And a backscratcher.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.338
I live alone.

18:28.541 --> 18:31.342
Ugh. I hope this isn't
the backscratcher.

18:34.614 --> 18:35.980
(tapping)

18:35.982 --> 18:38.583
Okay, time for our
last two toasts,

18:38.585 --> 18:40.418
uh, Sienna and Tess.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.186
Sienna, will you start us off?

18:43.089 --> 18:45.023
I'm Sienna,

18:45.024 --> 18:46.958
and thanks to Cotillion class,
I've learned that

18:46.960 --> 18:49.660
not only am I beautiful
on the outside,

18:49.662 --> 18:51.562
I'm beautiful on the inside.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.397
Thank you!

18:53.399 --> 18:55.066
You're welcome.

18:55.068 --> 18:56.801
That's not a toast.

18:57.303 --> 18:59.003
Cheers?

18:59.839 --> 19:01.239
Thank you, Sienna.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.374
Next up,
Tess O'Malley.

19:05.278 --> 19:06.611
Sneakers!?

19:06.613 --> 19:08.246
You just mad.

19:10.183 --> 19:12.150
All right, well, I'm Tess.

19:12.152 --> 19:13.651
I didn't think I was
gonna learn anything

19:13.653 --> 19:16.254
in this Cotillion class,
but I did.

19:16.256 --> 19:18.189
I learned how important
good posture is

19:18.191 --> 19:20.324
and when to use the small
little forks at dinner.

19:21.294 --> 19:23.628
But, I also learned that

19:23.630 --> 19:26.164
I don't have to be
somebody I'm not.

19:26.166 --> 19:29.800
So, I will continue taking
this Cotillion class my way,

19:29.802 --> 19:31.536
in high tops

19:31.538 --> 19:32.970
instead of high heels.

19:32.972 --> 19:36.374
(applause, cheering)

19:36.376 --> 19:39.243
Who needs the box step when
you can do the box out step?

19:40.613 --> 19:43.014
One, two, three,
one, two, three,

19:43.016 --> 19:46.217
one, two, three... pointer!
Cheers!

19:46.219 --> 19:48.052
(applause)

19:48.054 --> 19:51.189
Wowza! Now, that's a toast.

19:53.660 --> 19:54.559
Ugh.

19:54.561 --> 19:57.128
I wasn't told to bring props.

19:57.130 --> 19:59.564
¶ ¶

19:59.566 --> 20:01.365
Booker.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.234
Listen,

20:03.236 --> 20:06.304
I didn't mean to dismiss
your style. It's just...

20:07.340 --> 20:09.106
It's a little hard for me
to see you grow up.

20:09.409 --> 20:10.775
A little?

20:11.177 --> 20:12.376
Okay, a lot.

20:13.146 --> 20:15.146
You're not a little kid anymore.

20:15.148 --> 20:17.381
You are a young man who can

20:17.383 --> 20:19.050
choose his own clothes.

20:19.052 --> 20:21.652
Really, Mom?
Do you mean that?

20:21.654 --> 20:24.255
I am going to try really hard

20:24.257 --> 20:25.623
to mean that, yes.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.359
Oh.

20:28.361 --> 20:29.660
Okay, okay, look!

20:33.066 --> 20:34.165
(gasp)

20:34.167 --> 20:36.400
-Mom!
-Huh?

20:36.402 --> 20:38.202
The camo wind pants?

20:38.204 --> 20:40.238
-These are dope!
-You picked them. I just...

20:40.240 --> 20:42.640
all I did was purchase them.
Here, try 'em on.

20:49.349 --> 20:52.917
Well, uh, I am a...
a young man now,

20:52.919 --> 20:55.553
so, uh, need to...

20:55.555 --> 20:58.289
-Oh! Got it! Yes!
-Yeah.

20:58.291 --> 20:59.557
-Yes, my...
-Okay.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.192
My little young man.
He's...

21:02.362 --> 21:04.328
Dress all by himself.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.798
This was only
a short documentary,

21:07.800 --> 21:10.935
but it turned into a wild ride.

21:10.937 --> 21:14.472
I learned so much from
Booker and Nia and Tess,

21:14.474 --> 21:17.275
but they also learned
a lot about themselves.

21:17.277 --> 21:19.427
In their own words...

21:19.428 --> 21:21.578
I guess some people do
make assumptions about you

21:21.581 --> 21:23.247
based on how you dress,

21:23.249 --> 21:26.484
but it's up to you to
decide who you really are.

21:26.486 --> 21:29.453
I'm just Tess. Label-free,
high heel-free,

21:29.455 --> 21:31.122
and free to be me, and...

21:31.124 --> 21:33.457
with good posture.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.760
Clothes don't make the man,

21:35.762 --> 21:38.429
but the clothes I picked out
make this man

21:38.431 --> 21:40.431
look real good.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.566
I see you, camouflage.

21:42.568 --> 21:44.135
Gonna put you on.

21:44.137 --> 21:46.304
So, what did I learn from this?

21:46.306 --> 21:48.906
I learned that everyone's
style is different.

21:48.908 --> 21:51.309
You don't have to dress
to impress anyone.

21:51.311 --> 21:54.278
And pick your own style
to express yourself.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.547
And I am rockin' this cap!

21:57.317 --> 22:00.117
I am Levi Grayson.

22:00.119 --> 22:04.121
(applause)

22:04.123 --> 22:06.190
(cheering)
That's my son!

22:07.694 --> 22:09.860
Levi, would you come up
and take a bow?

22:11.931 --> 22:13.964
No! No! No!

22:13.966 --> 22:16.534
Uh, excuse me. (chuckle)

22:16.536 --> 22:19.437
Hey look, I had a vision.
Trust me, I'm saving you,
brother.

22:20.440 --> 22:23.841
Hey, no one needs to
hear Levi talk, right?

22:23.843 --> 22:26.010
(laugh) You guys wanna
hear from me, right?

22:26.012 --> 22:29.280
(booing)

22:29.282 --> 22:32.283
All:
Levi! Levi! Levi!

22:32.285 --> 22:34.752
Levi! Levi! Levi!

22:34.754 --> 22:38.956
Oh, you all-- you all
wanna hear Levi. Ha, ha!

22:38.958 --> 22:41.292
Sorry, buddy.
That was my vision.

22:42.161 --> 22:43.227
(pats back)

22:43.863 --> 22:45.029
You like me!

22:45.031 --> 22:46.330
(applause)

22:46.332 --> 22:47.765
Come on up!

22:51.204 --> 22:53.304
Oh, my son,

22:53.306 --> 22:55.206
the little filmmaker.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.141
Yes. Levi, I am
going to need a copy

22:57.143 --> 22:58.809
of that for my
college applications.

22:58.811 --> 23:01.746
Yo, I am so inspired
by us right now.

23:01.748 --> 23:04.348
You know, Rae, we looked
pretty good, too.

23:04.350 --> 23:06.517
(scoff) Obviously.
Uh, listen here.

23:06.519 --> 23:09.053
Levi, next time you
make a documentary,

23:09.055 --> 23:11.822
I'm gonna need you to make it
about me. Why? Because I'm a...

23:11.824 --> 23:15.259
All:
Fashion designer of
children's haute couture!

23:15.261 --> 23:17.261
Yeah, yeah...

23:18.364 --> 23:20.197
Rae:
At least you know.
At least you know.

23:20.199 --> 23:22.800
