WEBVTT

00:04.354 --> 00:05.946
We started his new
medication this morning,

00:06.023 --> 00:07.854
and it's already made
a big difference.

00:09.593 --> 00:12.790
Oh, he can't wait to see you, too.

00:12.863 --> 00:15.593
Yeah, he's having
a very good day.

00:16.533 --> 00:19.058
Oh. Oh, you mean today.

00:19.570 --> 00:21.595
Oh, no, no. That's fine.
That would be great.

00:21.672 --> 00:25.164
Uh, well, yeah, I always say,
family is the best medicine.

00:25.676 --> 00:29.510
40 minutes? Okay. We'll see you then.

00:31.648 --> 00:34.481
Joseph. That was your niece.
They're going to be here any minute.

00:34.551 --> 00:37.714
You know, I had a neighbor once,
and his last name was Neighbors.

00:37.788 --> 00:39.813
He had a crabapple tree
out in the back.

00:39.890 --> 00:42.358
Joseph, they're going to be here
soon. We don't have much time.

00:42.426 --> 00:46.226
I need you to remember
what happened in 1968.

00:46.296 --> 00:49.732
You were talking about it this
morning. The Hampton Street Depository.

00:49.800 --> 00:52.394
Crabapple. But you couldn't
eat the fruit. It was no good.

00:52.469 --> 00:56.769
Joseph. I need you to focus. You
said it was a big, big, big secret.

00:56.840 --> 00:59.673
Remember? I showed... You
know, my first car was a DeSoto.

00:59.743 --> 01:03.144
Beautiful machine.
It was as big as a boat.

01:03.213 --> 01:06.080
Well, Joseph,
you had your chance.

01:06.149 --> 01:08.083
I can't find my hat.

01:08.151 --> 01:11.712
I don't know where it is.
Gregory Peck always wore a hat.

01:11.788 --> 01:14.723
What was that movie
Gregory Peck was in?

01:14.791 --> 01:17.487
There was Gregory Peck,
and then there was a hat.

01:17.561 --> 01:19.495
It was a gift from my
neighbor. My other neighbor.

01:19.563 --> 01:21.531
Uh-huh.
That's fascinating.

01:21.598 --> 01:23.122
Yeah, well,
guess how tall she was.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.929
Five foot tall
in her bare feet.

01:25.002 --> 01:27.800
And guess if she knew
karate. Yes, she did.

01:27.871 --> 01:29.429
Nobody cares, Joseph.

01:29.506 --> 01:32.441
Hey, why
are we going upstairs?

01:32.509 --> 01:35.273
I never go upstairs.
It's way too dangerous.

01:35.345 --> 01:36.937
I just can't take that risk,
you understand?

01:37.014 --> 01:39.073
I want my hat.
You probably don't.

01:39.149 --> 01:41.344
You don't understand
anything, do you, Joseph?

01:41.418 --> 01:44.080
What are you doing? I've got
to get my hat. Where is my hat?

01:44.154 --> 01:46.122
You're
going to get your hat.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.679
Wait a minute.
Are you crazy?

01:47.758 --> 01:49.623
What are you doing?

01:49.693 --> 01:51.627
Wait a minute.
Where the hell is my hat?

01:53.000 --> 01:59.074

02:03.740 --> 02:05.469
It's a jungle out there

02:06.209 --> 02:10.645
Disorder and confusion
everywhere

02:10.714 --> 02:12.909
No one seems to care

02:12.983 --> 02:14.007
Well, I do

02:14.084 --> 02:17.019
Hey, who's in charge here?

02:17.087 --> 02:18.748
It's a jungle out there

02:20.857 --> 02:23.087
Poison in the very air
we breathe

02:24.094 --> 02:26.289
You know what's in the water
that you drink?

02:26.530 --> 02:27.519
Well, I do

02:27.597 --> 02:30.395
It's amazing

02:30.901 --> 02:32.425
People think I'm crazy

02:32.502 --> 02:34.026
'cause I worry
all the time

02:34.204 --> 02:36.764
If you paid attention,
you'd be worried, too

02:37.574 --> 02:38.768
You better pay attention

02:38.842 --> 02:41.174
Or this world
we love so much

02:41.745 --> 02:44.612
might just kill you

02:45.482 --> 02:47.746
I could be wrong now

02:47.818 --> 02:49.581
But I don't think so

02:49.653 --> 02:51.746
'Cause there's a jungle
out there

02:52.356 --> 02:54.119
It's a jungle out there

03:09.373 --> 03:11.841
Don't stop, honey.
You sound great.

03:11.908 --> 03:13.603
No slouching.

03:18.582 --> 03:20.072
What is it
this time?

03:20.150 --> 03:21.674
Sorry to bother
you, ma'am.

03:21.752 --> 03:23.151
We had another
noise complaint.

03:23.220 --> 03:25.586
You've got to
be kidding. From who?

03:25.655 --> 03:28.920
He wouldn't give his name.
We think it's the same guy.

03:28.992 --> 03:30.254
Oh! They're leaving.

03:30.327 --> 03:32.056
Finally.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.187
Is she
in handcuffs?

03:33.263 --> 03:34.287
I don't see her.

03:34.364 --> 03:37.765
What? Why aren't they arresting her?

03:37.834 --> 03:42.464
The justice system in this
country is a joke. God.

03:42.539 --> 03:46.600
There she goes again. Natalie,
you've got to make her stop.

03:46.676 --> 03:48.303
I can't stand it.
I can't.

03:48.378 --> 03:50.039
I still don't hear it.

03:50.113 --> 03:53.674
You don't hear that?
Are you kidding me?

03:53.750 --> 03:58.449
She was practicing all
night. I couldn't sleep.

03:58.955 --> 04:02.447
I kept reaching for
the phone to call...

04:03.126 --> 04:07.222
Dr. Kroger? I know.
I miss him, too.

04:07.297 --> 04:11.529
I actually
left him two messages.

04:13.937 --> 04:16.769
I just still
can't believe it.

04:16.839 --> 04:21.777
A heart attack?
I saw him the day before.

04:21.845 --> 04:25.008
He looked fine.
He looked...

04:25.082 --> 04:26.447
We'll find
a new therapist.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.074
There has to be
somebody out there.

04:28.151 --> 04:31.609
No. There will never
be anybody else.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.555
I mean,
the man saved my life.

04:35.092 --> 04:39.461
You didn't know me before Dr. Kroger.
I mean, I was a little messed up.

04:39.529 --> 04:40.723
You know?

04:40.797 --> 04:43.061
He wasn't just a therapist.

04:43.133 --> 04:45.124
He was...

04:46.903 --> 04:48.871
He was Dr. Kroger.

04:49.673 --> 04:52.574
We'll keep looking. What about the
one that my brother recommended?

04:52.642 --> 04:54.735
Dr. Beecham?
No.

04:54.811 --> 04:57.109
The chairs in his
waiting room were too low.

04:57.180 --> 04:59.114
How about the man you met
yesterday? He seemed nice.

04:59.182 --> 05:01.514
Natalie! Eye patch!

05:01.585 --> 05:05.988
Listen. Oh, come on. Listen, you
can hear that. It's even louder now.

05:08.492 --> 05:11.427
By all that's holy!
Give us a break!

05:26.209 --> 05:28.973
Oh, here's one. Before adding
fuel to the primary tank...

05:29.045 --> 05:31.878
You turn the fuel
selector switch to reserve.

05:31.948 --> 05:33.643
Correct.

05:33.717 --> 05:36.948
Hey. Okay, what about
this one? Here? Yeah?

05:37.020 --> 05:38.783
Monk, those are
all closed.

05:38.855 --> 05:41.847
What do you want to do? Do
you want to solve them again?

05:44.394 --> 05:45.418
You okay?

05:45.495 --> 05:47.360
I'm just... I'm just tired. I'm tired.

05:47.430 --> 05:48.419
Why don't you go home?

05:48.498 --> 05:52.195
Can't. Beethoven Junior is still at it.

05:53.170 --> 05:54.467
Come on. Give me
another one.

05:54.538 --> 05:57.473
Uh. Safe water markers
are traditionally...

05:57.541 --> 05:59.532
Green and red horizontal stripes. Nice.

05:59.609 --> 06:00.633
What are you doing?

06:00.710 --> 06:03.338
Oh, I'm buying a boat next
week, if my loan comes through.

06:03.413 --> 06:05.472
Randy's helping me study
for the maritime exam.

06:05.549 --> 06:09.485
Here's one. What does
this mean? "Dot-dot-dash. "

06:09.553 --> 06:11.487
Morse code.
You can skip that.

06:11.555 --> 06:12.613
You know Morse code?

06:12.689 --> 06:14.350
My boys were
both Boy Scouts.

06:14.424 --> 06:16.585
Yeah? I was an Eagle Scout.

06:16.660 --> 06:18.184
Hmm.
Hey, what am I saying?

06:18.261 --> 06:20.695
What about this one?
Here, look.

06:20.764 --> 06:22.959
Joseph Moody.
This one's still open.

06:23.033 --> 06:25.661
Uh, no. Not anymore, actually.
The M.E. Just called on this.

06:25.735 --> 06:27.896
Uh... It's officially
an accident.

06:27.971 --> 06:30.303
His private nurse
found him yesterday.

06:30.373 --> 06:33.342
He was 89 years old. Fell
down a flight of stairs.

06:34.010 --> 06:36.535
Stairs?
That sounds suspicious.

06:36.613 --> 06:37.875
What's suspicious about it?

06:37.948 --> 06:41.475
Are you kidding? Nine
decades of perfect health?

06:41.585 --> 06:44.679
Guy just up and dies? I
think we should check it out.

06:44.754 --> 06:46.346
Are you really
that bored?

06:46.423 --> 06:47.754
Yes, I am.

06:50.527 --> 06:52.654
I'm sorry.
I'm a little confused.

06:52.729 --> 06:53.923
You're from Homicide?

06:53.997 --> 06:56.898
Uh, yes, ma'am. Our office has to
sign off on the coroner's report.

06:56.967 --> 06:58.298
It's just a formality.

06:58.368 --> 07:00.268
I know this is a
difficult time, Ms. Moody.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.770
It will just take
a couple of minutes.

07:01.838 --> 07:04.739
Real estate agents?
Are you selling the house?

07:04.808 --> 07:07.572
We don't have a choice.
There's no other family.

07:07.644 --> 07:09.612
Do you know anyone
who's interested?

07:09.679 --> 07:12.512
It's a wonderful house, and
we're flexible on the price.

07:12.582 --> 07:13.674
We just want
to sell it.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.081
Mmm-hmm.

07:15.151 --> 07:17.881
Your uncle had a private
nurse named Ms. Drake?

07:17.954 --> 07:21.082
That's right. We were lucky
to find her. She was wonderful.

07:21.157 --> 07:24.092
Excuse me. Are these floors Douglas fir?

07:24.160 --> 07:25.593
I think so.

07:25.662 --> 07:27.687
I have her, uh,
statement right here.

07:27.764 --> 07:30.255
Uh, she said the accident
occurred at around 10:30?

07:30.333 --> 07:31.322
That's right.

07:31.401 --> 07:35.235
We were driving up to visit, and it must
have happened just before we arrived.

07:35.305 --> 07:37.637
Excuse me. Sorry.
Does the fireplace work?

07:37.707 --> 07:39.368
As far as I know.

07:39.442 --> 07:40.773
Do you work?

07:40.844 --> 07:41.902
It's so clean.

07:41.978 --> 07:46.210
I know. My uncle was
compulsive about all that stuff.

07:46.616 --> 07:51.212
Before his stroke, he was always dusting
and cleaning. Polishing everything.

07:51.288 --> 07:53.620
Polishing
everything.

07:54.291 --> 07:57.624
According to Ms. Drake, your
uncle was taking a new medication.

07:57.694 --> 08:00.754
Tribiteral? She said
it made him disoriented.

08:00.830 --> 08:02.092
She said she went
to the kitchen.

08:02.165 --> 08:04.759
When she came back, your uncle
was upstairs on the landing?

08:04.834 --> 08:06.392
I thought he
couldn't walk.

08:06.469 --> 08:08.664
Well, he could walk some.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.262
Short distances.

08:10.507 --> 08:12.236
Before she could reach him,

08:12.309 --> 08:15.710
he must have...
Lost his balance.

08:16.646 --> 08:20.742
They found him right
there. His neck was broken.

08:23.853 --> 08:26.117
Here. Here,
have a seat.

08:26.189 --> 08:27.918
It's okay.

08:27.991 --> 08:30.824
Okay. Okay.

08:31.428 --> 08:32.452
Okay.

08:39.269 --> 08:42.102
Okay. Do you know if the roof is new?

08:43.440 --> 08:47.877
Ma'am? Ma'am,
just nod your head.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.605
Roof new?

08:49.679 --> 08:53.581
What? What
about the roof?

08:53.650 --> 08:56.847
I might be interested.
In the house.

08:56.920 --> 08:58.945
I might want to buy it.
You what?

08:59.022 --> 09:01.013
I just have...
I just have one question.

09:01.091 --> 09:03.582
Do any of the neighbors
play piano?

09:03.660 --> 09:05.150
I wouldn't know.

09:05.228 --> 09:08.163
The walls are so thick, you
can't really hear anything.

09:08.231 --> 09:09.789
Really?

09:09.866 --> 09:11.595
Monk, come here.

09:13.937 --> 09:15.768
You are tired.

09:16.206 --> 09:18.333
You're not thinking straight.
You're between shrinks.

09:18.408 --> 09:21.775
You can't be making any
big decisions right now.

09:21.845 --> 09:24.006
You can't hear anything.

09:24.314 --> 09:29.251
Monk, look.
We all miss Dr. Kroger.

09:30.487 --> 09:33.251
Go home.
Get some sleep.

09:34.090 --> 09:37.491
You can't just buy a house
on some crazy impulse.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.619
I'll take it.

09:48.271 --> 09:51.172
I can't believe you bought
a house without telling me.

09:51.241 --> 09:52.640
You would have said no.

09:52.709 --> 09:55.371
Well, let's see what Dr.
Bell has to say about it.

09:55.445 --> 09:57.436
Why should I care
what this clown thinks?

09:57.514 --> 10:00.142
He's a therapist. He's
supposed to be brilliant.

10:00.216 --> 10:03.310
He's written five books,
and he teaches at Stanford.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.783
One minute to go.
If he's late, we're leaving.

10:05.855 --> 10:09.518
Oh, look. His first name
is Neven. "N-E-V-E-N."

10:09.592 --> 10:11.184
It's a palindrome.
That's a good sign.

10:11.261 --> 10:15.561
It's not a perfect palindrome.
The first "N" is capitalized.

10:15.632 --> 10:18.430
Dr. Kroger's name was Charles.
That wasn't a palindrome.

10:18.501 --> 10:19.968
It was to me.

10:26.009 --> 10:30.105
Mr. Monk.
Neven Bell.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.781
I've been looking
forward to this.

10:36.786 --> 10:37.775
Wipe?

10:42.559 --> 10:48.020
Summit Creek. That's your
brand, isn't it? Here.

10:48.498 --> 10:52.901
A glass exactly...
There you go.

10:53.870 --> 10:57.465
Half filled. Or would you
call it half empty? Hmm?

11:02.679 --> 11:04.670
Where did you get
that painting?

11:04.814 --> 11:08.807
I love that piece. That's
from Charles Kroger's office.

11:09.385 --> 11:11.945
I asked Madeline
if I could have it.

11:12.021 --> 11:13.045
Huh.

11:13.122 --> 11:15.352
It doesn't look right,
in here.

11:16.192 --> 11:18.353
I miss him, too.

11:20.263 --> 11:21.924
You okay?

11:22.131 --> 11:25.498
Just tired.
I haven't been sleeping.

11:26.135 --> 11:30.697
Hmm. All right. Then, why don't
we start right there, then?

11:30.807 --> 11:32.741
Why haven't you been sleeping?

11:32.809 --> 11:34.743
No big mystery.

11:34.811 --> 11:39.578
This girl who lives across the
street plays piano. Same song.

11:44.187 --> 11:47.179
Doesn't matter, really. It
doesn't matter. I'm out of there.

11:47.257 --> 11:51.159
I'm moving. I just...
I just bought a house.

11:51.261 --> 11:53.354
Well, congratulations.
Yeah.

11:53.429 --> 11:57.695
Hmm. So, when did it start?
The piano playing?

11:57.767 --> 12:00.201
I don't know.
About a year ago.

12:00.270 --> 12:04.673
Hmm. But it's only been bothering
you for, what? Five weeks?

12:06.609 --> 12:07.633
How did you know that?

12:07.710 --> 12:10.611
Oh. Well, the girl's been
playing piano for a year,

12:10.680 --> 12:14.616
and it's only been bothering
you since Charles Kroger passed.

12:14.717 --> 12:17.618
What? No. No.
Oh, no.

12:17.687 --> 12:20.713
Come on, the music she's playing
is Chopin. Charles loved Chopin.

12:20.790 --> 12:22.883
He played it in his waiting
room all the time. No. No.

12:22.959 --> 12:25.519
Maybe the music is reminding
you of... Of your friend,

12:25.595 --> 12:28.325
and it's been
affecting you. Hmm?

12:28.398 --> 12:31.663
No. No, no, no. No.
Huh. Well.

12:31.734 --> 12:35.226
Maybe. That's just
crazy. That's crazy talk.

12:35.305 --> 12:37.273
Well, Adrian.

12:37.707 --> 12:40.574
Now, I know we've just met.
But for what it's worth,

12:40.643 --> 12:42.941
I don't think you should be
buying a house right now.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.343
I can't believe this.

12:44.414 --> 12:47.941
I think maybe you're buying this property to
avoid dealing with the loss of your friend.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.041
Okay.

12:49.118 --> 12:51.177
All right? What's the rush?
Wait a few weeks.

12:51.254 --> 12:52.983
Maybe a year.
Yeah.

12:53.056 --> 12:55.251
My second wife,
she was in real estate.

12:55.325 --> 12:57.020
You know, lots of
her clients, different...

12:57.093 --> 12:59.254
Can I tell you what I think?
Please.

12:59.329 --> 13:02.958
I don't think this is
working out. I'm sorry.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.159
I just don't feel
comfortable.

13:05.234 --> 13:10.103
And, I'm going to be looking
for a different therapist. So...

13:10.506 --> 13:12.497
Well...

13:13.810 --> 13:15.869
I'm really sorry
to hear that, Adrian.

13:15.945 --> 13:17.810
I really am.
Yeah.

13:20.316 --> 13:21.647
So...

13:25.488 --> 13:27.422
I thought you were leaving.

13:27.490 --> 13:28.957
I can't leave early.

13:29.592 --> 13:31.822
Natalie would kill me.

13:32.228 --> 13:35.095
Hmm. All right.
Well, then, I guess.

13:35.431 --> 13:37.331
Then, we'll just sit.
Hmm?

13:40.036 --> 13:41.401
All right.

14:03.393 --> 14:07.295
93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98.

14:07.797 --> 14:10.994
Do you have any
with 100?

14:11.067 --> 14:12.466
I don't know.
Whatever's there...

14:12.535 --> 14:14.662
Here's the thing.
I'm buying a new house,

14:14.737 --> 14:17.797
and I just came from a therapist
who didn't think I could handle it.

14:17.874 --> 14:19.307
No kidding.
Get this.

14:19.375 --> 14:22.071
He said I was moving because
the girl across the street

14:22.145 --> 14:24.511
reminded me of
my old therapist

14:24.580 --> 14:26.548
because they both
liked Chopin.

14:26.616 --> 14:28.743
Uh-huh.
I know. Crazy, right?

14:28.818 --> 14:32.117
His name was Dr. Kroger.
Charles Kroger. Chuck.

14:32.188 --> 14:33.849
Some people called him
Chuck. I didn't.

14:33.923 --> 14:36.517
I had a lot of respect.
Too much respect for him.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.093
Well, he passed
about five...

14:38.161 --> 14:43.690
I'm sorry. I've got to go
be somewhere else. Good luck.

14:46.436 --> 14:48.063
Hey, congratulations.
Huh?

14:48.137 --> 14:50.799
Yeah, I couldn't help overhearing.
You got yourself a house, huh?

14:50.873 --> 14:52.602
Yeah.
It's a great feeling.

14:52.675 --> 14:54.734
Pride of ownership.
Right.

14:54.811 --> 14:57.439
You know, if you want, I could drill
a couple more holes into that for you.

14:57.513 --> 14:59.743
Really? Oh, it would just
take a couple of seconds.

14:59.816 --> 15:02.284
I'm the same way about my
shower. Very particular.

15:02.351 --> 15:04.615
My girlfriend says
I'm obsessive about it.

15:04.687 --> 15:06.814
I get that all the time.
Do you?

15:06.889 --> 15:09.824
Here. Let me give you this.
Jake Phillips.

15:09.892 --> 15:13.419
Handyman. Answer to a
homeowner's prayers, right there.

15:13.496 --> 15:16.056
"'Honest' Jake. No job
too small or too dirty. "

15:16.132 --> 15:17.360
That's right.
Now, hang onto that.

15:17.433 --> 15:18.923
Because you're moving
into a new place.

15:19.001 --> 15:22.164
And if something's creaking or
bulging or leaking or cracking,

15:22.238 --> 15:26.038
who are you going to call?
Who are you going to call?

15:26.109 --> 15:27.098
Honest Jake.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.609
That's me!

15:28.678 --> 15:30.737
Okay.

15:34.917 --> 15:38.876
Uh, be careful with that! I
say! Sir! Sir! Use both hands.

15:38.955 --> 15:42.823
Don't make me pull out the
contract. Two hands. And use care.

15:42.892 --> 15:45.520
Care. Okay. Care...
Carefully! Watch your step.

15:45.595 --> 15:48.063
Watch your step. And the next
step. Carefully. Carefully.

15:48.131 --> 15:50.691
Carefully. That one has to...
That one has to stay level.

15:50.767 --> 15:55.898
You can use the horizon, but level.
Yeah. Pull. That one says, "Fragile. "

15:55.972 --> 15:57.132
They all say, "Fragile. "

15:57.206 --> 15:59.401
Yeah, but that's underlined.
That means really fragile.

15:59.475 --> 16:03.241
And if it's underlined twice,
that means very, very, extremely.

16:03.312 --> 16:07.078
Hello? Extremely fragile.
Yeah, okay.

16:07.150 --> 16:09.744
That one, you want to be careful with.

16:09.819 --> 16:12.515
Easy. Easy.
Where's the fire?

16:12.588 --> 16:17.321
Where's the fire? Okay, you
want to... Want to take a break?

16:17.393 --> 16:20.157
Should we take a break?
Let's take five.

16:20.229 --> 16:25.394
And, here,
is another bathroom.

16:25.468 --> 16:28.926
For a total of
two bathrooms.

16:29.005 --> 16:31.166
That is a claw-foot bathtub,

16:31.240 --> 16:32.935
which is something
I've always wanted.

16:33.009 --> 16:34.670
It is?
Yeah.

16:34.744 --> 16:36.678
I just didn't know. Oh,
I love all the woodwork.

16:36.746 --> 16:38.577
Okay. Don't touch that.
What? Wet paint?

16:38.648 --> 16:43.017
No. Just don't touch it.
Another wall, hallway.

16:43.386 --> 16:48.255
More walls, another wall, and
we're back in the living room.

16:48.324 --> 16:52.158
I can't believe it.
You actually did it!

16:52.228 --> 16:56.688
Now, that's a new rug. Don't just
stand on it. You have to keep moving.

16:57.133 --> 16:58.122
Moving?

16:58.201 --> 17:00.692
So it doesn't wear out
in one place.

17:01.370 --> 17:03.634
Oh, you mean
like this?

17:04.240 --> 17:05.400
Maybe wider circles.

17:05.473 --> 17:07.874
Okay, I'm just going
to stand over here.

17:07.944 --> 17:10.674
So, what do you think?

17:10.746 --> 17:14.375
I like it. I do. I think
you're going to be really...

17:15.518 --> 17:17.281
You're going to be...

17:17.987 --> 17:19.045
Happy.
Happy.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.419
I already am. I should
have done this years ago.

17:21.490 --> 17:23.617
And you don't miss your
old apartment? Why should I?

17:23.693 --> 17:27.026
Because Trudy was there. And
this house is not the same.

17:27.096 --> 17:30.497
And you're not a big fan
of "not the same. "

17:30.633 --> 17:33.966
Well, maybe I've matured.

17:37.273 --> 17:38.740
I said
maybe I've matured.

17:38.808 --> 17:41.208
Mr. Monk, I was raised
in an older house.

17:41.277 --> 17:44.075
There are going to be
problems. There always are.

17:44.146 --> 17:47.513
And you just can't call the
super, you know? You're it.

17:47.583 --> 17:48.811
You're...
You're responsible.

17:48.885 --> 17:50.250
That's what
I love about it.

17:50.319 --> 17:53.254
I have never been
responsible for anything.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.415
I want to be responsible.
You do?

17:55.491 --> 18:01.487
I want to be part of something.
Something real. Something permanent.

18:02.531 --> 18:07.798
Natalie. I'm... I'm home.

18:08.170 --> 18:11.697
You're right.
It's wonderful!

18:11.774 --> 18:16.108
Oh, okay. Let's celebrate. I'm going
to open up some of that sparkling cider.

18:16.345 --> 18:22.375
So, I'd like to make a toast,
here you go, to your house.

18:22.451 --> 18:25.750
No. To your home. May it
finally bring you the peace...

18:25.821 --> 18:26.845
Shut up. Shut up.

18:26.923 --> 18:28.413
Shut up. Shut. Shut.

18:28.491 --> 18:29.617
What?

18:30.493 --> 18:33.792
That light fixture.
It's off center.

18:33.863 --> 18:36.855
What? Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Come on, Mr. Monk. Come on.

18:36.933 --> 18:38.662
Three inches, maybe.
Three and a half?

18:38.734 --> 18:40.429
It's no big deal.
I didn't even notice it.

18:40.503 --> 18:42.300
Closer to four.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.498
Okay. Here. Hold this.
Why don't we just...

18:44.573 --> 18:49.010
Look, I'm just going to
move the table. How's that?

18:50.813 --> 18:52.678
You're right. That's it.
That's much better.

18:52.748 --> 18:53.772
Thank you.

18:53.849 --> 18:56.079
Okay. All right.
So, to you...

18:56.152 --> 18:58.086
Now, the table's not
centered on the rug.

18:58.154 --> 19:00.247
Okay. That's it. Um...

19:00.323 --> 19:02.883
I'm out of here.
I'll see you tomorrow.

19:09.198 --> 19:12.190
I really appreciate this.
I mean, on such short notice.

19:12.268 --> 19:14.361
I appreciate
the business.

19:15.404 --> 19:19.898
Well, you see...
It's not quite centered.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.969
Absolutely. Yeah. That
would drive anybody crazy.

19:23.045 --> 19:25.878
Let's take a look at
this puppy, shall we?

19:26.782 --> 19:30.548
All right. This is going
to be easy. Piece of cake.

19:30.619 --> 19:32.109
A little walk in
the park, here.

19:32.188 --> 19:34.588
You know what we're going to do?
We're going to reattach this fixture

19:34.657 --> 19:36.784
to a parallel support beam.

19:36.859 --> 19:38.417
It's going to
be good as new.

19:38.494 --> 19:39.825
Oh, I hope so. Be careful.

19:39.895 --> 19:42.056
Yeah. All right. You're a little
bit of a nervous Nellie, are you?

19:42.131 --> 19:44.292
I've got a cousin like you.

19:44.367 --> 19:46.835
He makes coffee nervous.

19:47.570 --> 19:51.472
All right. Hold this.
You got it? Okay.

19:51.774 --> 19:56.473
All righty. You've got
another one coming, here.

19:56.545 --> 19:59.036
Okay. There we go.
Heads up.

19:59.115 --> 20:00.412
Got it.

20:01.884 --> 20:04.284
Uh-oh. Uh-oh?
What, uh-oh?

20:04.353 --> 20:06.787
Your wires are all frayed.
The connection is rusted.

20:06.856 --> 20:08.687
Oh?
What does it mean?

20:08.758 --> 20:10.692
Well, it means you're
not up to code, my friend.

20:10.760 --> 20:14.161
This is a fire trap. Okay, we're going
to have to run a new line to here.

20:14.230 --> 20:16.664
We're going to have to go through
that wall, feed it up over here...

20:16.732 --> 20:20.099
Well. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. I love that wall.

20:20.169 --> 20:23.605
That's... That's
my third favorite wall.

20:23.672 --> 20:27.608
Adrian. I'm a surgeon. It's just going
to be like taking out an appendix.

20:27.676 --> 20:30.042
A little incision,
snip, snip, snip.

20:30.112 --> 20:31.443
Pop over with the wire.

20:31.514 --> 20:34.608
And the fixture, a little
spackle, a little paint.

20:34.683 --> 20:39.017
Is it going to be,
you know, like...

20:39.088 --> 20:40.953
Messy?

20:41.023 --> 20:43.821
Nah. No way. You won't
even know I was here.

20:52.234 --> 20:55.101
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh? Again, uh-oh?

20:55.204 --> 20:57.502
I do not like
the look of this.

20:57.573 --> 20:59.564
All right. We've got
a little problerino.

20:59.642 --> 21:01.007
It's what we call a glitch.

21:01.077 --> 21:03.011
A glitch? Okay.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.906
See this pipe?
Right there?

21:06.982 --> 21:09.348
That's your primary
water line. It's corroded.

21:09.418 --> 21:11.545
Of course it is.
Almost all the way through.

21:11.620 --> 21:14.054
It could burst any time. I thought
you got this place inspected.

21:14.123 --> 21:15.147
I did. I did.

21:15.224 --> 21:16.953
What? Was the guy
blind in both eyes?

21:17.026 --> 21:20.018
All right. Listen to me, Adrian,
I've got to be honest with you.

21:20.096 --> 21:21.893
Because I respect you
very much.

21:22.765 --> 21:24.096
This whole section has to go.

21:24.166 --> 21:27.192
Oh, no. Right here.
Which means this wall,

21:27.269 --> 21:29.829
that wall and this half
of the floor.

21:31.006 --> 21:32.030
What about that half?

21:32.108 --> 21:34.804
That's gonna have to
come up, too.

21:34.877 --> 21:36.845
But I know a great plumber.
His name is Ramone.

21:36.912 --> 21:38.777
They call him Honest Ramone.
Of course they do.

21:43.452 --> 21:44.612
Careful.

21:49.091 --> 21:52.549
Are you okay? You didn't
really have a choice.

21:52.628 --> 21:55.859
I mean, if the pipes
are corroded. Oh, gosh.

21:55.931 --> 21:58.593
You know, I've been through lots of
renovations, it's always like this.

21:58.667 --> 22:00.464
I could tell you
some real stories.

22:00.536 --> 22:02.026
Well, please,
please don't.

22:03.272 --> 22:04.330
Do you want to stay
at my place?

22:04.406 --> 22:07.671
No. They're almost done.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.509
Uh-oh.
No good.

22:13.082 --> 22:14.174
No.

22:15.017 --> 22:16.177
What?

22:16.452 --> 22:20.286
We've got to find out what these are
to, okay? Probably go up over there.

22:20.356 --> 22:21.550
On the
other side, no?

22:21.624 --> 22:24.286
Yeah, the other side.
Go ahead. Yeah.

22:26.028 --> 22:27.996
Me no cut, no?
Yeah. Go ahead.

22:28.063 --> 22:29.462
No problem.
Excuse us.

22:29.532 --> 22:31.864
Right through here, no?
Just watch the molding.

22:38.073 --> 22:39.506
Attaboy.

22:53.389 --> 22:54.617
Hey, Jake.
Can you see me?

22:56.292 --> 22:57.987
Stand up.

23:19.048 --> 23:21.516
So, you are, like,
a detective?

23:21.584 --> 23:23.142
No, he's the best
detective in the world.

23:23.219 --> 23:25.585
Maybe not the world.
Well, who's to say?

23:25.654 --> 23:28.714
So, what's
going on, Columbo?

23:28.791 --> 23:30.884
Okay. This is Joseph Moody's wheelchair.

23:30.960 --> 23:32.154
It was still
in the garage.

23:32.228 --> 23:33.252
Who?

23:33.329 --> 23:35.957
The old man who used to live
here. He fell down these stairs.

23:36.031 --> 23:40.491
He had a private nurse who said
he walked up to that landing.

23:40.569 --> 23:41.695
But look.

23:43.739 --> 23:46.333
Here, here, here.

23:46.408 --> 23:49.775
Tire tracks.
They're a perfect match.

23:49.878 --> 23:51.175
And this.

23:54.917 --> 23:56.441
Wallpaper.

23:56.752 --> 23:57.946
Look.

24:00.522 --> 24:02.581
You can see where
it was ripped away.

24:03.158 --> 24:05.092
No, no, I think...

24:05.160 --> 24:07.720
I think she wheeled him
up these stairs.

24:07.796 --> 24:10.560
So, you just put that
together? Just like that?

24:10.633 --> 24:12.897
Fantastic.

24:12.968 --> 24:14.265
And this.

24:16.338 --> 24:18.898
"Tribiteral. "
It's a new prescription.

24:18.974 --> 24:21.340
This is the stuff she
said made him disoriented.

24:21.410 --> 24:24.277
It's never been opened.
Do you think she killed him?

24:24.346 --> 24:27.281
She lied about it.
There must be a reason.

24:37.526 --> 24:38.857
Hey, Cassie.

24:40.029 --> 24:41.758
Jake.

24:42.498 --> 24:44.056
You scared me to death.

24:44.133 --> 24:46.693
They've got you working
the night shift again, huh?

24:46.769 --> 24:48.293
Yeah.
That sucks.

24:48.370 --> 24:50.497
It throws off
the whole internal clock.

24:50.572 --> 24:52.369
It gets it all
out of whack, huh?

24:54.777 --> 24:56.677
How did you get in?

24:56.745 --> 24:59.441
Sliding door.
It's broken.

25:00.082 --> 25:03.142
No, it's not.
No. It is.

25:04.253 --> 25:06.050
So, how's it going?

25:06.121 --> 25:09.147
When am I
going to see my share?

25:09.224 --> 25:11.954
See, buttercup,
that's why I'm here.

25:12.027 --> 25:15.463
We ran into a little
bump in the road today.

25:15.531 --> 25:17.260
Guess who bought
the house?

25:18.667 --> 25:20.100
Adrian Monk.

25:21.270 --> 25:22.760
I don't know him.

25:22.838 --> 25:24.601
He's on to you, Cassie.

25:24.673 --> 25:27.540
Jake,
it wasn't my fault.

25:27.609 --> 25:29.543
I didn't want to kill him.
I know.

25:29.611 --> 25:31.670
He would have told everyone.

25:31.747 --> 25:34.079
I really didn't have a choice.
I know.

25:48.364 --> 25:49.524
So,
how's the new house?

25:49.598 --> 25:51.463
I don't
want to talk about it.

25:51.533 --> 25:54.969
I don't want to think about it.
Every 20 minutes, it's something else.

25:55.037 --> 25:59.269
Something's rusted or corroded or
falling apart or about to fall apart.

25:59.341 --> 26:00.638
Oh, wow. I can't
wait to see it.

26:00.709 --> 26:04.042
It's like a nightmare, except for the
part where you wake up and it's all over.

26:04.113 --> 26:05.341
Why didn't you warn me?

26:05.414 --> 26:07.439
I did. I tried to.
I think we all did.

26:07.516 --> 26:09.677
Well, why didn't you tie me
down and shoot me in the leg?

26:09.752 --> 26:13.518
What's the good of having a gun if
you don't shoot your friend in the leg

26:13.589 --> 26:15.216
when he's about to
buy an old house?

26:15.290 --> 26:16.985
Next time, I will.
I promise.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.329
Hello?

26:31.774 --> 26:33.241
Hey, did you hear
the one about the...

26:37.112 --> 26:41.515
That's not the way I heard it. My
husband was in the Navy, remember?

26:42.918 --> 26:44.249
Lmpressive.

26:44.319 --> 26:45.718
Ms. Drake?

26:51.693 --> 26:53.092
Oh, my God!
Stay there.

26:53.162 --> 26:54.823
Phone it in!
Stay there.

27:05.340 --> 27:08.832
Still no murder weapon.
Doc says knitting needle.

27:09.978 --> 27:11.104
What do you think?

27:11.180 --> 27:13.705
He was tossing the place?
She walked in?

27:13.782 --> 27:17.240
I don't think so.
Look at the drawers.

27:17.719 --> 27:20.381
They were pulled out
and flipped over,

27:20.456 --> 27:22.651
but everything is
just piled up.

27:22.724 --> 27:25.318
He didn't really
rifle through it.

27:25.494 --> 27:26.791
He was here for her.

27:26.862 --> 27:27.851
Captain.

27:27.930 --> 27:32.526
Check this out. I found it in her
closet. Four grand. Maybe more.

27:32.601 --> 27:33.659
All 20s and 50s.

27:33.735 --> 27:35.464
Geez. I should have
gone to nursing school.

27:35.537 --> 27:38.529
1967, 1966?

27:40.275 --> 27:44.507
These are 40 years old. Some of
the serial numbers are sequential.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.946
I'll call Treasury.
Maybe they can trace them.

27:47.015 --> 27:50.178
Want to come? I can't. I should go home.

27:50.252 --> 27:52.117
See if
it's still there.

28:00.796 --> 28:03.765
Mr. M! Are you ready for some good news?

28:03.832 --> 28:05.629
Yes. Please.
Thank you.

28:05.701 --> 28:09.193
Ramone is getting married!
His old lady said yes!

28:09.271 --> 28:11.262
Ramone! Huh?

28:11.340 --> 28:13.433
No. What about the house?

28:13.509 --> 28:15.374
Yeah. You know, I'm
glad you mentioned that.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.571
Ramone! Ramone!

28:20.315 --> 28:21.782
We found some mold.

28:21.850 --> 28:23.078
Mold?
Go ahead.

28:23.151 --> 28:26.348
It probably started in the
bathroom and spread from there.

28:26.421 --> 28:28.048
So, what we've got to
do is, we've got to go in

28:28.123 --> 28:29.147
and we've got to
get the mold out.

28:29.224 --> 28:32.660
No, no, no. Please, Honest
Jake, I am begging you.

28:32.728 --> 28:35.288
Okay. Okay. Don't.
That's fine.

28:35.364 --> 28:38.822
If you want to live,
you know, with the spores,

28:38.901 --> 28:43.065
the fungus, the bacteria.
Living, spreading,

28:43.405 --> 28:45.339
eating your house
from the inside out.

28:45.407 --> 28:47.534
Uh, it's your decision.

28:49.077 --> 28:51.807
It's your house.
I'll go put this back.

29:02.024 --> 29:05.516
Just remind me.
Why did you move, again?

29:06.061 --> 29:09.553
Oh, yeah. That's right. Your
last place was too noisy.

29:13.068 --> 29:16.128
Hey! I found this in the
attic. Where do you want it?

29:16.204 --> 29:18.172
You can just
leave it here.

29:33.789 --> 29:36.485
"Fire Hydrants to be Painted. "

29:36.558 --> 29:40.050
Look at this.
"More Rain Expected Thursday. "

29:40.128 --> 29:42.528
"Garden Club to Meet"?
It's so boring.

29:42.598 --> 29:44.589
Why would you save all this?

29:45.334 --> 29:48.064
Well, maybe...

29:52.174 --> 29:53.641
I have no idea.

29:54.710 --> 29:57.406
It was before my time, but my
father told me all about it.

29:57.479 --> 29:59.413
He was in his office, right
up there, when it happened.

29:59.481 --> 30:02.109
1968. The day
before Christmas.

30:02.184 --> 30:05.210
Yeah. I was just a kid, but I
remember everybody talking about that.

30:05.287 --> 30:06.413
Is that the gate?

30:06.488 --> 30:10.788
Yes, sir. Three gunmen stole a milk
truck, rammed it through that gate.

30:10.859 --> 30:13.657
They shot two guards and walked
away with four million dollars.

30:13.729 --> 30:17.130
And this is back when four million
dollars was considered a lot of money.

30:17.833 --> 30:19.061
Just go on.

30:19.134 --> 30:21.364
All I know is, we never
recovered a nickel.

30:21.436 --> 30:22.698
Until today.

30:23.472 --> 30:25.463
From the robbery?
Yep. Serial numbers match.

30:25.540 --> 30:27.235
We've got $4,200 there.

30:27.309 --> 30:29.971
A woman named Cassie Drake
was murdered last night,

30:30.045 --> 30:32.343
and we found this in her
closet. Where's the rest of it?

30:32.414 --> 30:34.814
We're working on that.
I was rereading the file.

30:34.883 --> 30:38.046
They caught two of
the three, career bad guys.

30:38.120 --> 30:40.486
They died in prison without
ratting out their partner.

30:40.555 --> 30:41.886
Guess he wasn't
a big spender.

30:41.957 --> 30:43.356
Or he was scared or dead.

30:43.425 --> 30:46.451
Well, the woman who died,
she was a private nurse.

30:46.528 --> 30:49.326
Her last patient was
a man named Joseph Moody.

30:49.398 --> 30:50.422
Ring a bell?

30:50.499 --> 30:52.831
I can check him out. The employment
records are in the basement.

30:52.901 --> 30:53.890
It will take me
ten minutes.

30:53.969 --> 30:55.061
Good deal.

32:33.401 --> 32:37.701
Mr. Monk. I've got a confession to make.

32:38.840 --> 32:40.967
They really don't
call me Honest Jake.

33:07.569 --> 33:09.935
They're looking for
the money, aren't they?

33:10.005 --> 33:12.872
Yeah. The old man
robbed those armored cars.

33:12.941 --> 33:16.138
He hid the money
somewhere in this house.

33:16.211 --> 33:19.612
Forty years later, he's
older. Dementia sets in.

33:19.681 --> 33:22.309
He starts babbling about it
to his private nurse.

33:22.384 --> 33:26.650
She killed him before he could start
blabbing about it to somebody else.

33:27.856 --> 33:30.051
So, she tells her friend,
Not-so-honest Jake.

33:30.125 --> 33:33.617
Yeah. They were probably more than
friends. They were probably sex lovers.

33:35.497 --> 33:38.830
That's what he's been doing here the
whole time. Looking for the money.

33:38.900 --> 33:40.128
You're not going to
believe this.

33:40.202 --> 33:42.932
He's still not the worst
contractor I've ever seen.

33:44.973 --> 33:47.737
Can you... Can you
reach that hammer?

33:48.176 --> 33:49.700
I'll try.

34:04.192 --> 34:08.389
All right, now.
Pull. Come on. Pull.

34:30.985 --> 34:32.283
Now, what?

34:32.353 --> 34:35.187
Nothing. That nail
was driving me crazy.

34:39.226 --> 34:41.752
Oh, God.
What?

34:41.830 --> 34:43.956
He still hasn't
fixed that light.

35:01.416 --> 35:02.815
Oh, my God.

35:02.884 --> 35:04.010
What?

35:04.085 --> 35:06.246
Oh, my God!

35:06.321 --> 35:07.310
What?

35:10.225 --> 35:11.351
"Oh, my God,"
what?

35:11.426 --> 35:14.725
What do you see? Hmm?

35:14.996 --> 35:16.827
What do you see?

35:19.034 --> 35:21.161
What do you see, huh?

35:22.938 --> 35:25.304
Hmm?
Something in here?

35:32.247 --> 35:36.240
This is a false wall. There's a
reason that light wasn't centered.

35:36.318 --> 35:41.654
Because this is a false wall.
Come on. Move the furniture.

35:41.723 --> 35:44.521
Move the furniture.
Move it. It's in here.

35:49.631 --> 35:50.655
Here?

35:50.732 --> 35:52.597
Yep. Take it down.

35:52.667 --> 35:53.929
Jake. Jake.

35:57.005 --> 35:58.597
What do you want to do with
your share of the money?

35:58.673 --> 36:01.608
Same thing I'm going to do
with your share. Spend it.

36:12.454 --> 36:15.719
Come on. This way.

36:24.432 --> 36:25.524
This way.

36:34.776 --> 36:37.108
One, two, three, go.

36:42.384 --> 36:44.249
Is he dead?
Are you dead?

36:44.319 --> 36:46.787
He's not dead.
He's not dead.

36:46.855 --> 36:48.288
He's... still breathing.
Oh, God.

36:48.356 --> 36:49.755
He's going to wake up
any minute.

36:49.824 --> 36:52.190
Help! Somebody help us!

36:52.260 --> 36:55.661
Forget it. It's no use.
Nobody's going to hear you.

36:55.730 --> 36:56.992
The door. The front door.

36:57.065 --> 36:58.430
Go. Go, go.

37:00.201 --> 37:01.190
Go. Pull.

37:01.269 --> 37:03.169
Just pull. Okay.

37:06.341 --> 37:08.172
Yeah.
Pull, pull.

37:08.243 --> 37:09.369
Good.

37:09.444 --> 37:12.072
We got it.
We got it. Pull!

37:13.748 --> 37:16.911
Yes. Once more.

37:16.985 --> 37:18.145
Nice.

37:18.219 --> 37:20.449
Oh, God. Mr. Monk, we're never
going to make it up those stairs.

37:20.522 --> 37:22.581
You're right.
It's too heavy.

37:23.658 --> 37:26.559
Follow me.
Follow you? Okay, pull.

37:29.898 --> 37:32.458
Good. We've got it.
We've got it.

37:32.534 --> 37:33.933
Again.

37:35.036 --> 37:36.298
Keep it coming.

37:36.371 --> 37:38.999
I've got it.
I've got it.

37:40.375 --> 37:42.673
Hand me those rags.
Right there.

37:43.545 --> 37:44.705
What for?

37:44.779 --> 37:45.905
I'm calling for help.

37:45.980 --> 37:47.948
Pull, pull,
pull the tub closer.

37:48.016 --> 37:50.143
Pull it. Pull.

37:50.218 --> 37:51.446
Ow.

37:55.390 --> 37:56.789
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

38:00.762 --> 38:03.424
You were right!
Joseph Moody.

38:03.498 --> 38:07.696
Worked here nine years. Retired
six weeks after the robbery.

38:07.769 --> 38:09.134
What a surprise.

38:09.204 --> 38:11.968
Actually, he lived right around
the corner on Beech Street.

38:12.040 --> 38:15.271
Yeah, we know. A friend of
ours just bought that house.

38:15.577 --> 38:16.703
What the hell?

38:18.980 --> 38:20.914
Looks like a signal.

38:21.082 --> 38:24.711
Dot, dot, dot.

38:24.786 --> 38:25.775
"S."

38:27.055 --> 38:29.080
Uh... "O."
Is that a dash?

38:29.624 --> 38:31.990
"O"... "S-O."
So.

38:32.060 --> 38:34.187
"Soda. " Somebody's
selling soda.

38:34.262 --> 38:36.389
It's Natalie.
She's in trouble!

38:41.870 --> 38:43.667
Come on.

38:54.215 --> 38:55.648
Oh, God.

38:57.085 --> 39:01.283
If you like my work,
tell your friends.

39:03.158 --> 39:05.922
All about word of mouth,
my business.

39:07.529 --> 39:09.224
On second thought...

39:12.033 --> 39:13.500
I'm going to retire.

39:15.236 --> 39:16.863
Drop the gun!

39:16.938 --> 39:18.735
On the ground!
On the ground!

39:19.908 --> 39:21.068
Hands! Let me see your hands!

39:21.142 --> 39:22.575
Take it easy.

39:24.379 --> 39:27.542
Are you okay?
Get up. Get up.

39:28.950 --> 39:30.508
Good luck.

39:30.585 --> 39:31.813
Got it?

39:52.507 --> 39:54.498
Holy moly.
What happened here?

39:54.576 --> 39:56.601
I should never have
bought this house.

39:57.779 --> 40:01.044
I should have waited for
something better to come along.

40:01.649 --> 40:03.116
Like death.

40:05.787 --> 40:07.254
What about your father?

40:07.522 --> 40:09.422
What's... What's your
happiest memory of him?

40:09.490 --> 40:12.618
My father, um, well, he took
me to a football game once.

40:12.694 --> 40:13.718
Sounds like fun.

40:13.795 --> 40:16.355
No. Every time the team
went into a huddle,

40:16.431 --> 40:19.366
he turned to me and said.
"They're talking about you. "

40:19.434 --> 40:20.458
Talking about you?

40:20.535 --> 40:22.696
They weren't. Were they?

40:22.770 --> 40:28.072
No, I... That seems pretty unlikely.
I don't know why he would say that.

40:28.142 --> 40:32.408
Because one player kept looking up
at me. I thought I saw him laughing.

40:32.480 --> 40:36.041
Well, I'm pretty sure they were talking
about the game and what play to run next.

40:36.117 --> 40:37.812
He was looking right at me.

40:37.885 --> 40:39.978
Hmm. Well...

40:40.054 --> 40:41.112
Right at me.

40:41.189 --> 40:45.285
Uh, our time is up. Next session,
let's pick it up right here. All right?

40:45.360 --> 40:47.123
All right. What's, uh...

40:47.195 --> 40:48.219
What's, uh...

40:48.296 --> 40:49.695
What's good for you?

40:49.764 --> 40:51.425
Uh, how's 3:00?

40:51.532 --> 40:53.966
All right. 3:00.
What day?

40:54.035 --> 40:55.502
You know, today.

40:56.237 --> 40:57.829
Today? That's...

40:57.905 --> 41:00.396
That's in two hours. You
mean, you want to come back?

41:00.475 --> 41:02.705
Unless you have
something sooner.

41:02.777 --> 41:04.677
No, it's completely booked up.

41:04.746 --> 41:06.714
What's tomorrow
look like?

41:06.764 --> 41:11.314
