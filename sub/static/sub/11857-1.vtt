WEBVTT

00:06.333 --> 00:07.542
Yo, is that
thing
on or what?

00:07.625 --> 00:09.291
Yeah, yeah, dawg,
look at that red light.

00:09.375 --> 00:10.750
See it?

00:13.041 --> 00:15.083
'Yo, what's up,
<i>mamacitas?'</i>

00:15.166 --> 00:16.166
'Oh, shwing!'

00:18.417 --> 00:22.750
Stop being a
reject.
Give me that.

00:24.542 --> 00:27.208
You're about to
enter
another dimension.

00:27.291 --> 00:29.333
It's a dimension not
only
of sight and of
sound..

00:29.417 --> 00:30.792
But of tweakers, preps

00:30.875 --> 00:33.125
horny housewives
and morons galore.

00:33.208 --> 00:35.583
It's the ninth circle of hell.

00:35.667 --> 00:38.542
The sweaty armpit of Suburbia.

00:38.625 --> 00:41.500
You've just crossed over into..

00:41.583 --> 00:43.166
...the mall.

00:46.875 --> 00:48.333
'Whoa, whoa, whoa.'

00:48.417 --> 00:51.083
- Shop till you drop.
- Right on.

00:52.875 --> 00:55.166
(Neal)
'Uh-oh.'

00:55.250 --> 00:56.709
'"Eenie, meanie'

00:56.792 --> 00:58.959
'"miney, mo.'

00:59.041 --> 01:01.834
'"Catch a tiger by its toe.'

01:01.917 --> 01:03.625
"If he hollers

01:03.709 --> 01:05.000
"let him go.

01:05.083 --> 01:06.041
'"Eenie..'

01:06.125 --> 01:07.333
'"...meanie..'

01:07.417 --> 01:10.709
'...miney...mo."'

01:12.291 --> 01:14.000
Looks like
it's homeslice's lucky day.

01:14.083 --> 01:15.208
'Ah, dope.'

01:19.166 --> 01:21.041
A regular Saturday afternoon

01:21.125 --> 01:22.917
'in America's town square.'

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Huh.

01:28.333 --> 01:29.542
Everyone.

01:42.417 --> 01:43.834
(woman on TV)
'The city is still
reeling'

01:43.917 --> 01:45.375
'weeks after
two teenage gunmen'

01:45.458 --> 01:47.834
'opened fire
at the Woodland Valley mall'

01:47.917 --> 01:51.875
'killing 15 bystanders
before taking their own
lives.'

02:18.959 --> 02:20.959
The lieutenant still got
you in deep freeze, Lil?

02:21.041 --> 02:22.625
The man knows how
to hold a grudge.

02:22.709 --> 02:24.917
This about that fugitive,
what's his face?

02:25.000 --> 02:27.375
It's Joseph,
and it's past tense

02:27.458 --> 02:28.458
the fugitive part.

02:28.542 --> 02:29.500
Is that a fact?

02:29.583 --> 02:31.083
At least from what I hear.

02:31.166 --> 02:32.291
I wonder where he's, uh..

02:32.375 --> 02:34.875
...docking his
tugboat these
days.

02:34.959 --> 02:36.500
You got me.

02:36.583 --> 02:37.834
Okay.

02:37.917 --> 02:39.750
So, Scotty,
you coming with tonight?

02:39.834 --> 02:42.166
- Why, what's up?
- Nurses.

02:42.250 --> 02:43.458
Nice.

02:43.542 --> 02:45.166
Oh, milking that newfound
bachelorhood, huh?

02:45.250 --> 02:46.375
Every drop.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.625
- Morning, boss.
- Scotty. Nick.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.917
Boss.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.667
You remember the
Coulter-Hanlon job back in
'95?

02:55.750 --> 02:57.458
Two kids opened
up with a
shotgun

02:57.542 --> 02:59.250
and a TEC-9 in the mall?

02:59.333 --> 03:02.417
Yeah. Took forever
to process the scene.

03:02.500 --> 03:03.750
The doers offed
themselves

03:03.834 --> 03:07.041
after taking out,
what, uh...15 people?

03:07.125 --> 03:09.125
The contractors
renovating
the air vents

03:09.208 --> 03:10.917
found a video camera.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.417
(Rush)
'And?'

03:12.500 --> 03:15.250
Well, it looks like it was
used to film the massacre.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.917
(male #1 on video):
<i>mamacitas?'</i>

03:20.000 --> 03:21.500
(male #2)
'Oh, shwing!'

03:23.000 --> 03:26.375
'Stop being a reject.
Give me that.'

03:26.458 --> 03:28.375
(Miller)
'Real laugh riot,
these two.'

03:28.458 --> 03:30.625
The survivors say
they busted a gut the whole
time

03:30.709 --> 03:32.458
they were mowing folks down.

03:32.542 --> 03:34.333
Hell of a thing to get on tape.

03:34.417 --> 03:35.959
(Stillman)
'The only footage that
exists.'

03:36.041 --> 03:38.750
No working surveillance cameras
in that wing of the mall.

03:38.834 --> 03:40.291
Only at the two exits.

03:40.375 --> 03:43.667
The survivors never mentioned
the kids having a video
camera.

03:43.750 --> 03:45.291
A lot of times
in shootings like this

03:45.375 --> 03:46.792
people's memories are shaky.

03:46.875 --> 03:48.583
(Rush)
'One witness claims
the gunmen were wearing'

03:48.667 --> 03:52.208
red baseball caps, another
swears they were yellow.

03:52.291 --> 03:53.583
Killer kids.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.583
First this then Columbine.

03:55.667 --> 03:58.333
- Glad I don't got kids.
- I thought I saw something.

03:58.417 --> 04:01.542
Rewind it.

04:01.625 --> 04:02.792
'Right there.'

04:02.875 --> 04:04.083
Did you see his face?

04:04.166 --> 04:07.667
Neal was handing off
the video camera.

04:07.750 --> 04:09.792
So what?

04:09.875 --> 04:12.959
Who was he handing it to?

04:13.041 --> 04:14.667
'Everyone.'

04:16.917 --> 04:19.458
A third shooter?

04:58.041 --> 04:59.917
(Vera)
'"I am The Destroyer'

05:00.000 --> 05:01.208
'"The Apocalypse'

05:01.291 --> 05:02.834
'"The Widowmaker.'

05:02.917 --> 05:04.875
'"I am a rifle, I am a gun.'

05:04.959 --> 05:07.208
"Look down the barrel
of my hate

05:07.291 --> 05:09.875
we're going
to have some fun."

05:10.625 --> 05:12.041
Words to live by.

05:12.125 --> 05:15.542
Cameron's journal,
two days before the shoot-out.

05:15.625 --> 05:17.542
And Neal's artwork

05:17.625 --> 05:18.834
broadcasting their intentions

05:18.917 --> 05:20.333
loud and clear.

05:20.417 --> 05:23.250
According to classmates,
everyone knew the game plan.

05:23.333 --> 05:24.750
The boys talked about it 24/7.

05:24.834 --> 05:26.709
But no one believed 'em.

05:26.792 --> 05:29.000
Whatever happened to kids
punching each other out?

05:29.083 --> 05:30.792
Now they're mowing
each other down.

05:30.875 --> 05:33.083
And we still
don't know
why.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.875
Ah, childhood buddies, uh..

05:34.959 --> 05:37.250
Juniors at Lakefield
High
at the time of the
killing.

05:37.333 --> 05:39.667
(Vera)
'On weekends, Neal pushed
a broom at the mall.'

05:39.750 --> 05:42.542
Cameron was a counter boy
at the Cinnamon King.

05:42.625 --> 05:44.583
Well, maybe our third shooter
works at the mall, too.

05:44.667 --> 05:48.083
Stashes a video camera after
the rampage, gets out of Dodge.

05:48.166 --> 05:49.917
Where'd the camera come from?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.709
Running the serial numbers.

05:51.792 --> 05:53.834
According to the
boy's
computer logs

05:53.917 --> 05:55.792
"The Destroyer"
and "The Apocalypse"

05:55.875 --> 05:57.959
were monikers they used online.

05:58.041 --> 05:59.834
'Big fans of
the game called'

05:59.917 --> 06:01.208
"Renegade Massacre."

06:01.291 --> 06:03.250
What all young
minds
should aspire to.

06:03.333 --> 06:04.917
If Cameron was "The Destroyer"

06:05.000 --> 06:07.709
and Neal was "The Apocalypse"

06:07.792 --> 06:09.083
who's "The Widowmaker"?

06:09.166 --> 06:10.291
Our third shooter.

06:10.375 --> 06:12.083
The name doesn't
come up in the logs.

06:12.166 --> 06:13.250
Well, let's check with the
parents could have went

06:13.333 --> 06:14.750
to school with him.

06:14.834 --> 06:16.792
Bring in the survivors, too.
See what they remember.

06:16.875 --> 06:18.333
Cameron's folks
are still in town.

06:18.417 --> 06:21.041
Neal's family relocated
to Georgia two years ago.

06:21.125 --> 06:23.208
If I were them I would have
run for the hills, too.

06:25.333 --> 06:27.750
I knew my kid wasn't
the ringleader.

06:27.834 --> 06:31.625
Cameron was always
well-behaved. He was polite.

06:31.709 --> 06:33.458
He was more of
a follower, really.

06:33.542 --> 06:35.834
He play a lot of online
video games, Mr. Coulter?

06:35.917 --> 06:38.208
I tried to get him
into sports, but..

06:38.291 --> 06:39.750
...he never took to them.

06:39.834 --> 06:43.208
You familiar with a game
called "Renegade Massacre?"

06:43.291 --> 06:44.709
It's just a game.

06:44.792 --> 06:47.500
Did Neal and Cameron ever play
online games with other kids?

06:47.583 --> 06:48.667
All the time.

06:48.750 --> 06:50.000
Dayton Moore was one.

06:50.083 --> 06:52.542
Dayton Moore?
He was one of the survivors.

06:52.625 --> 06:54.375
'He used to live down
the block.'

06:54.458 --> 06:57.542
Three of them were thick
as thieves until high school.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.375
He's a real bossy kid.

06:59.458 --> 07:02.834
He bullied Cameron
and Neal all the time.

07:02.917 --> 07:05.000
Right.
Thanks for your time.

07:05.083 --> 07:06.834
You're going to interrogate
him,
aren't you?

07:06.917 --> 07:08.417
We'll be in touch,
Mr. Coulter.

07:08.500 --> 07:11.250
It's easier for you to
pretend
we're monsters, isn't it?

07:11.333 --> 07:12.333
Excuse me?

07:12.417 --> 07:14.667
Just like the
newspapers did.

07:14.750 --> 07:16.500
The TV.

07:16.583 --> 07:18.333
What everyone forgets..

07:18.417 --> 07:21.709
...that day
we lost a child,
too.

07:28.208 --> 07:30.667
(male #3)
'My wife,
her name is Jackie.'

07:30.750 --> 07:32.792
'She's in there.'

07:32.875 --> 07:35.125
(female #1)
'Please, help,
my daughter's in there!'

07:35.208 --> 07:36.375
'Get her out!'

07:36.458 --> 07:38.250
'The survivors are coming out.'

07:38.333 --> 07:39.458
Coming out.

07:43.291 --> 07:44.959
'Tara, Tara, Oh, my God, Tara!'

07:45.041 --> 07:46.125
(man)
'Tony, oh, my God.'

07:46.208 --> 07:51.125
(little girl)
'Mommy! Mommy!'

07:51.208 --> 07:52.750
'Dayton!'

07:52.834 --> 07:55.083
- 'Dayton!'
- Oh, Mom!

07:55.166 --> 07:57.041
Mom!

07:57.125 --> 07:58.792
Oh, baby.

07:58.875 --> 08:01.333
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

08:04.500 --> 08:05.709
'There's..'

08:05.792 --> 08:07.959
...there's more
coming out, right?

08:08.041 --> 08:10.417
There's got to be
more coming out,
right?

08:10.500 --> 08:13.625
Are you the parents
of Cameron Coulter?

08:13.709 --> 08:15.041
Yes, we are.

08:15.125 --> 08:17.542
- You need to come with us.
- Why?

08:17.625 --> 08:20.709
No, we...we've got to
wait here for Cameron.

08:20.792 --> 08:23.250
We think your son
might have been involved.

08:23.333 --> 08:25.583
What?

08:25.667 --> 08:28.125
No, no, no.
You're-you're mistaken.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.083
My boy's not involved!

08:30.166 --> 08:31.375
Jim, what is going on?

08:31.458 --> 08:33.583
Oh, Jim.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.166
Everyone blamed us.

08:44.250 --> 08:46.750
'We were just an
ordinary family..'

08:46.834 --> 08:48.250
...just like your own.

08:48.333 --> 08:51.875
Ordinary families don't have
military assault rifles at
home.

08:51.959 --> 08:54.917
A man has a right
to his hobbies.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.208
I'm a hunter.

08:56.291 --> 08:57.542
What kind of animal

08:57.625 --> 09:00.959
do you hunt, with a TEC-9
semiautomatic?

09:13.250 --> 09:15.125
Could you leave that door open?

09:15.208 --> 09:17.417
Me and closed rooms
don't really mix so well.

09:17.500 --> 09:18.417
Sure.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.250
Detectives Rush, Miller.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.458
Always looking
for the exit,
huh?

09:23.542 --> 09:26.709
11 years later,
you'd think I'd be over it.

09:26.792 --> 09:28.667
You grew up
with Cameron and Neal?

09:28.750 --> 09:31.125
In grade school,
that's pretty much it. Why?

09:31.208 --> 09:33.166
You like playing
games online, Dayton?

09:33.250 --> 09:34.959
No, not really.

09:35.041 --> 09:37.166
'The game
"Renegade Massacre?"'

09:37.250 --> 09:40.166
Ring any bells?

09:40.250 --> 09:41.458
I don't know.

09:41.542 --> 09:43.000
How about
"The Widowmaker"?

09:45.917 --> 09:47.125
That was my online ID.

09:47.208 --> 09:48.667
I gamed every once
in a while, so what?

09:48.750 --> 09:49.709
Then why lie?

09:49.792 --> 09:50.709
'Cause I stopped playing

09:50.792 --> 09:52.917
with those psychos way before..

09:53.000 --> 09:54.375
...the, uh, the incident.

09:54.458 --> 09:55.667
(Miller)
'Why?'

09:55.750 --> 09:58.417
To them it wasn't just a game,
it was..

09:58.500 --> 09:59.500
...it was practice.

09:59.583 --> 10:00.709
So maybe a closet geek

10:00.792 --> 10:02.250
like yourself
got caught up, too.

10:02.333 --> 10:04.208
Took it past role-playing,
made it real.

10:04.291 --> 10:05.250
Look, lady..

10:05.333 --> 10:06.291
I was a jock..

10:06.375 --> 10:07.792
...pick of
the high school litter.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.375
I didn't need a fantasy life.

10:09.458 --> 10:11.166
You did online.

10:11.250 --> 10:12.375
The last thing I needed

10:12.458 --> 10:16.000
was to be seen in public
with those freaks.

10:19.792 --> 10:22.667
Check out Butter Face.

10:22.750 --> 10:25.709
'Everything's hot,
"but her face."'

10:29.667 --> 10:31.583
'Check out Davie the dork.'

10:34.083 --> 10:37.375
Bet Clearasil's making
a killing off of him.

10:37.458 --> 10:39.583
Come on, Zach,
leave the dork alone.

10:39.667 --> 10:41.333
Whatever.

10:43.250 --> 10:45.834
'Yo, litter getter! Kneel.'

10:46.959 --> 10:48.417
Got something for you.

10:50.959 --> 10:51.875
What?

10:51.959 --> 10:53.542
You missed a fry, dude.

10:55.875 --> 10:57.375
What fry?

11:00.625 --> 11:01.542
That one.

11:21.542 --> 11:22.875
Whoops.

11:27.834 --> 11:28.875
You know..

11:28.959 --> 11:31.333
...you are one talented
litter getter.

11:41.208 --> 11:43.375
Someone should take an Uzi
to this freaking mall.

11:45.917 --> 11:48.125
What do you think...dudes?

11:51.583 --> 11:53.792
Pow!

11:59.500 --> 12:00.625
When did this happen?

12:00.709 --> 12:01.709
Uh, a few months before

12:01.792 --> 12:03.709
they went ballistic.

12:05.542 --> 12:07.250
I was a jerk.

12:07.333 --> 12:09.458
'We all were.'

12:09.542 --> 12:10.959
Maybe if we hadn't,
then, you know

12:11.041 --> 12:13.625
none of this
would of happened.

12:13.709 --> 12:16.125
He killed a lot
of innocent people.

12:16.208 --> 12:19.083
You're not
responsible for that.

12:19.166 --> 12:21.583
Then who is?

12:30.125 --> 12:31.667
They look so normal.

12:34.583 --> 12:36.583
Are those
the kids who did it?

12:36.667 --> 12:38.000
Yeah.

12:38.083 --> 12:39.834
Some of the victims, too.

12:39.917 --> 12:42.333
Went to the same school.

12:42.417 --> 12:44.291
Could be the third
shooter's
in here.

12:44.375 --> 12:46.000
You getting any closer
to finding him?

12:46.083 --> 12:48.417
Most time, the
doer's
already in the box.

12:48.500 --> 12:49.750
Really?

12:51.041 --> 12:52.125
Yeah.

12:52.208 --> 12:53.458
Hmm.

12:57.250 --> 12:58.542
Really.

13:02.959 --> 13:04.125
Aren't you going
to put that away?

13:04.208 --> 13:06.750
- No.
- Why not?

13:06.834 --> 13:08.500
'Cause..

13:08.583 --> 13:11.000
...it helps me remember.

13:11.083 --> 13:14.291
Keeping photos
of the victims up
there.

13:15.291 --> 13:17.250
Remember what?

13:29.959 --> 13:32.041
You must have had
my photo up there,
too.

13:32.125 --> 13:33.709
[giggling]
No way.

13:37.959 --> 13:39.333
Rush.

13:39.417 --> 13:42.291
Been going through the
security
footage from the mall.

13:42.375 --> 13:44.000
Okay.

13:44.083 --> 13:45.375
Something
you got to see.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.959
'Be there in a few.'

13:52.792 --> 13:54.458
I'll be a couple hours.

13:54.542 --> 13:55.625
Sorry.

13:55.709 --> 13:57.083
'You got to do
what you got to do.'

13:59.500 --> 14:01.625
You might as well
get some sleep now.

14:01.709 --> 14:03.709
Why's that?

14:05.000 --> 14:07.667
'Cause you won't
get much later.

14:09.291 --> 14:11.583
(Kat)
Only two ways in or out
of this part of the mall.

14:11.667 --> 14:13.250
Security cameras
were at each exit.

14:13.333 --> 14:15.959
So, we can see who went
in with Cameron and Neal.

14:16.041 --> 14:18.417
Nope. Crowd's too thick,
couldn't even spot the boys.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.792
What about who came out
after the shooting
started?

14:20.875 --> 14:22.083
(Nick)
'Take a look.'

14:22.166 --> 14:25.000
3:05, the shooting begins.

14:25.083 --> 14:27.542
(Kat)
'Trapping 40 civilians
inside that wing'

14:27.625 --> 14:28.834
and our third shooter.

14:28.917 --> 14:31.417
The rampage continues
for 15 minutes and ends

14:31.500 --> 14:33.959
when SWAT
shows up right here.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.667
So how'd our
third
shooter get out?

14:36.750 --> 14:38.458
That's what
we were wondering.

14:42.417 --> 14:45.291
Well, maybe our guy
offed himself.

14:45.375 --> 14:47.166
Got caught in the cross fire.

14:47.250 --> 14:51.125
Cameron and Neal had the only
self-inflicted gunshot wounds.

14:51.208 --> 14:53.583
So, if our third shooter
isn't one of the dead..

14:53.667 --> 14:55.792
He's posing as one
of the survivors.

15:01.625 --> 15:03.500
(Scotty)
'Been interviewing
survivors all morning. No
dice.'

15:03.583 --> 15:05.291
(John)
'Keep at it, one of them is
got to have seen something.'

15:05.375 --> 15:08.125
A lot of blacked out
memories. Tough going back.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.500
The bottom line, people
don't want to remember.

15:11.709 --> 15:13.000
Hey.

15:13.083 --> 15:15.000
Late night with the nurses?

15:15.083 --> 15:18.166
- Somebody's gotta play
doctor.
- What have you got, Nick?

15:18.250 --> 15:20.208
Lead on the video
camera, traced it back

15:20.291 --> 15:22.041
to an electronic store
at the mall.

15:22.125 --> 15:24.333
Turns out it was stolen
a few days before the attack.

15:24.417 --> 15:25.542
Great.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.333
One of our survivors,
a kid named

15:27.417 --> 15:29.333
Davie Schulman,
was a stock boy there.

15:29.417 --> 15:32.166
- You have a talk with him?
- Miller's on it.

15:32.250 --> 15:34.750
Well, meanwhile, let's keep
interviewing the rest of them.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.709
Scotty, you got a minute?

15:42.583 --> 15:45.333
Get the door, huh?

15:49.250 --> 15:50.500
Detective Renaldi at West.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.750
- You're familiar right?
- Yeah, sure.

15:52.834 --> 15:55.500
He gave me the heads up
on a job they've been
working.

15:55.583 --> 15:56.542
Okay.

15:56.625 --> 15:57.834
A coach at a..

15:57.917 --> 15:59.834
...community boxing
program, early '80s.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.375
- A pedophile.
- Is that right.

16:02.458 --> 16:04.583
Your brother's
name
came up.

16:04.667 --> 16:05.625
What, Mike?

16:05.709 --> 16:07.000
Now, what's he got
to do with it?

16:07.083 --> 16:08.583
Well, it says here
he was in the
program

16:08.667 --> 16:09.709
when he was 12.

16:09.792 --> 16:10.875
So what?

16:10.959 --> 16:12.291
Well, one of the
guy's former
students

16:12.375 --> 16:14.959
is going to testify,
says he should, too.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.750
- He's got it wrong.
- You might want to take a
look.

16:18.834 --> 16:20.875
Like I said, boss, my brother's
got nothing to do with it so--

16:20.959 --> 16:24.208
The guy's still out
there
by the way, coaching.

16:24.291 --> 16:27.542
Until this
thing
goes to
court.

16:28.875 --> 16:32.208
No harm in looking, right?

16:47.917 --> 16:50.750
I kind of lost my trust
in people after that.

16:50.834 --> 16:53.875
I guess that's why
I ended up here.

16:53.959 --> 16:56.333
We're talking
to all the survivors,
Davie.

16:56.417 --> 16:59.583
There might have been
a third shooter.

17:00.417 --> 17:01.417
Third shooter?

17:01.500 --> 17:02.792
You see anyone
else that day

17:02.875 --> 17:04.500
with Cameron and Neal?

17:04.583 --> 17:07.417
I barely
remember anything.

17:07.500 --> 17:08.834
Flashes, sometimes.

17:08.917 --> 17:10.583
It was so loud.

17:10.667 --> 17:12.667
The gunfire.

17:12.750 --> 17:15.750
I didn't know bullets
could do that to people.

17:15.834 --> 17:17.792
It's not like
in the movies.

17:19.417 --> 17:21.375
No, it's not.

17:21.458 --> 17:25.083
I don't...really
like to talk about it?

17:26.375 --> 17:29.333
The third shooter
was using a video camera.

17:29.417 --> 17:33.333
'It was stolen from
the store you worked at.'

17:33.417 --> 17:34.917
Got something
to share, Davie?

17:35.000 --> 17:37.166
- You think I stole it.
- Did you?

17:37.250 --> 17:39.000
No.

17:39.083 --> 17:40.917
But you know who did.

17:43.542 --> 17:46.667
(Tina)
'Davie, hey,
<i>Papi Chulo?'</i>

17:46.750 --> 17:48.083
Hey.

17:48.166 --> 17:49.792
These are cool
video cameras.

17:49.875 --> 17:51.500
Maybe, we can
make some porn.

17:51.583 --> 17:54.000
Bow-chicka-bow-ow.

17:54.083 --> 17:56.667
I got to have one,
make a distraction for me,
okay?

17:56.750 --> 17:58.959
A distraction,
like-like what?

17:59.041 --> 18:02.583
Like, throw up or something.

18:02.667 --> 18:05.542
[chuckles]
I'm just kidding, Davie.

18:12.333 --> 18:14.375
Hmm, they should get a room.

18:14.458 --> 18:17.583
He was a jerk
to you, T. Screw
him.

18:17.667 --> 18:19.000
Zack's not that bad.

18:19.083 --> 18:22.333
Then why's he act like
he doesn't even know
you.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.667
'Cause I'm the hit
and run queen.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.917
Quit talking
about yourself like
that.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.917
Just thought he'd
be different, I guess.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.125
What a sucker.

18:39.333 --> 18:41.291
Maybe..

18:41.375 --> 18:44.750
...you deserve someone
who treats you better.

18:46.583 --> 18:49.125
Someone like...who?

18:54.458 --> 18:55.625
Anyway, I'm out of here.

18:55.709 --> 18:59.375
Oh, uh, what about
the video camera?

18:59.458 --> 19:00.542
What about it?

19:00.625 --> 19:02.542
What, you think
I'm klepto or something?

19:02.625 --> 19:04.500
See...see you later, I guess.

19:06.458 --> 19:09.959
Not if I see you first.

19:10.041 --> 19:12.166
[chuckles]
Thanks a lot.

19:17.500 --> 19:20.125
Tina was a lost kind of soul.

19:21.291 --> 19:22.709
She wouldn't have hurt anyone.

19:22.792 --> 19:23.917
You keep in touch?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.333
I dropped out of school
after, you know..

19:26.417 --> 19:28.542
...we kind of drifted apart.

19:28.625 --> 19:30.041
Thanks for your time, Davie.

19:30.125 --> 19:32.333
If you think
of anything else..

19:32.417 --> 19:34.000
...here's my card.

19:41.375 --> 19:44.792
I was a bad girl,
desperate for
attention.

19:45.875 --> 19:47.500
Shoplifting
was means to an end.

19:47.583 --> 19:50.959
How'd the video camera you
stole
end up in those boys' hands?

19:51.041 --> 19:52.458
What are you talking about?

19:52.542 --> 19:55.208
Cameron and Neal used it to
film their shooting spree,
Tina.

19:55.291 --> 19:57.291
What? Are you sure?

19:57.375 --> 19:59.542
- You knew them, right?
- 'From high school.'

19:59.625 --> 20:01.083
Yeah, but..

20:01.166 --> 20:03.458
...those guys were
seriously damaged goods.

20:03.542 --> 20:06.917
Talked about killing
all the time, everyone knew
it.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.875
Maybe we should have
listened to them, huh?

20:10.959 --> 20:13.166
Tell us what happened
to the video camera.

20:13.250 --> 20:15.291
I got busted, okay?

20:15.375 --> 20:16.959
Security guard
took me to mall jail.

20:17.041 --> 20:17.959
Then what?

20:18.041 --> 20:19.208
He threatened
to call my folks

20:19.291 --> 20:22.458
but hell if I was going
to let that happen.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.542
Quite the little
klepto...ain't we?

20:47.208 --> 20:50.959
So...what are you gonna
do about it...big boy?

20:51.041 --> 20:54.834
What do you think
I'm gonna do about it..

20:54.917 --> 20:56.792
... girlfriend?

20:56.875 --> 20:59.834
I'm going to call
your parents...that's what.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.583
(man)
Yo, Barry.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.458
You stay put.

21:27.625 --> 21:30.667
(Barry)
'The mall's entire
surveillance system.'

21:30.750 --> 21:32.000
Lay of the land.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.083
So you can see
everything from
here.

21:35.166 --> 21:37.625
Half these cameras
are for show.

21:37.709 --> 21:39.166
AKA "dummies."

21:39.250 --> 21:40.917
What about the cameras
on the second level?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.709
Yeah, the ones
near the escalators.

21:42.792 --> 21:44.542
(Barry)
'100 percent fake-o's.'

21:44.625 --> 21:47.041
'Management's a bunch
of tight wads.'

21:47.125 --> 21:49.000
So you could basically take
a machine gun in this place

21:49.083 --> 21:50.166
and nobody would ever know.

21:50.250 --> 21:51.917
'Or care.'

21:52.000 --> 21:54.041
Just imagine the look
on all their faces.

21:54.125 --> 21:56.709
(Lewis)
'That'd be something to see.'

21:56.792 --> 22:00.041
All those happy little folks.

22:00.125 --> 22:02.000
'Not so happy no more.'

22:04.125 --> 22:06.709
Why was he showing them
the mall security
system?

22:06.792 --> 22:09.625
'Cause he was a loser or
desperate for attention.

22:09.709 --> 22:11.542
What happened
to the video camera?

22:11.625 --> 22:13.792
He never ended up
calling my parents.

22:13.875 --> 22:16.375
Guess he pocketed it
for himself.

22:26.542 --> 22:27.834
Barry Lewis?

22:29.458 --> 22:31.834
- Yeah, that's me.
- Philly PD.

22:31.917 --> 22:34.333
Here about the mall shootout
back in '95.

22:34.417 --> 22:36.834
That's not something I spend
a lot of time reminiscing on.

22:36.917 --> 22:40.166
Wonder why you never mentioned
swiping that video camera.

22:40.250 --> 22:41.625
Video camera?

22:41.709 --> 22:43.750
I love it when they play dumb.

22:43.834 --> 22:46.917
The camera you used to film
your little shoot-out.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.917
Whoa. Hold up there, now.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.625
I was shot, if you don't recall.

22:50.709 --> 22:52.041
Great way to take the stink off

22:52.125 --> 22:53.542
what with your condition
and all.

22:53.625 --> 22:55.417
What exactly are you
accusing me of?

22:55.500 --> 22:57.291
Being a mall rent-a-cop
on a power trip.

22:57.375 --> 22:59.750
Planning a massacre
with two whacked-out assassins.

22:59.834 --> 23:01.667
And filming it.
That about covers it.

23:03.709 --> 23:06.667
Those kids stole
that camera off my desk.

23:06.750 --> 23:08.083
How convenient.

23:08.166 --> 23:09.458
Still doesn't explain
why you were showing them

23:09.542 --> 23:11.041
the surveillance system.

23:14.208 --> 23:15.667
They gave me respect.

23:15.750 --> 23:18.500
So you gave two sociopaths
the keys to the kingdom?

23:18.583 --> 23:21.792
Didn't matter in the end.
Me showing them the system.

23:21.875 --> 23:23.208
What do you mean
it didn't matter?

23:23.291 --> 23:26.125
Those kids weren't trying
not to be seen.

23:26.208 --> 23:27.959
They wanted to be on camera.

23:28.041 --> 23:29.500
Why would they want that?

23:29.583 --> 23:32.792
Same reason everybody else does.

23:32.875 --> 23:34.417
Fame.

23:52.959 --> 23:55.583
Smile for the camera, sucker.

24:01.250 --> 24:03.583
Hey...Hey..

24:05.959 --> 24:07.792
Hey!

24:09.291 --> 24:10.875
Let him bleed.

24:13.917 --> 24:16.875
Hey.
Hurry.

24:19.166 --> 24:21.625
You're okay.
You're okay.

24:21.709 --> 24:24.291
(Tina)
'Come on.'

24:25.792 --> 24:28.375
Look at me.

24:28.458 --> 24:30.500
No, wake up, wake up.
Look at me. Look.

24:30.583 --> 24:35.333
I ca...I can't feel nothin'.

24:35.417 --> 24:38.667
- Hey, hey, where's your
wallet?
- What?

24:38.750 --> 24:41.041
- Huh?
- Your wallet.

24:41.125 --> 24:43.166
You got your wife's picture
in here or your kids'?

24:43.250 --> 24:45.542
(Tina)
'You think about them
'cause you can't die.'

24:45.625 --> 24:48.875
I don't...I don't got nobody.

24:48.959 --> 24:50.709
- Sorry.
- No, no.

24:50.792 --> 24:54.792
Then you got to live. Okay?
Okay, you got to live.

24:54.875 --> 24:56.041
'Cause if you get out of here

24:56.125 --> 24:58.041
then maybe, you can find
somebody, okay?

24:58.125 --> 24:59.792
You just got to live. Okay?

25:01.125 --> 25:02.500
Okay.

25:08.667 --> 25:11.583
- I-I-I did this.
- Dayton!

25:11.667 --> 25:13.250
All of it.

25:13.333 --> 25:16.500
'It's all my fault.
it's all my fault.'

25:17.917 --> 25:20.875
I thought I was gonna die.

25:20.959 --> 25:23.667
What that girl said,
pulled me through.

25:23.750 --> 25:27.375
What did Dayton mean,
"I did this, all of it"?

25:29.667 --> 25:31.041
You got me.

25:32.041 --> 25:33.667
Could be,
he's our third shooter.

25:34.667 --> 25:35.917
(Lewis)
'Makes sense.'

25:36.000 --> 25:37.834
'Cause I certainly wasn't.

25:48.333 --> 25:49.792
You know, you guys
can't keep me in here.

25:49.875 --> 25:52.917
Oh, we can do whatever we want,
Dayton. We're the police.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.041
We know what you did. You told
Barry and Tina about it.

25:58.667 --> 26:00.542
You know, I don't have
to be in here.

26:00.625 --> 26:02.083
I'm leaving.

26:04.250 --> 26:05.583
Sit down.

26:15.792 --> 26:18.333
(Cameron on TV)
'You're about to enter
another dimension.'

26:18.417 --> 26:20.417
It's a dimension not only
of sight but of sound.

26:20.500 --> 26:24.500
(Neal)
'Full of tweakers, preps, horny
housewives and morons galore.'

26:24.583 --> 26:26.166
Turn that off.

26:26.250 --> 26:29.000
You played "Renegade Massacre"
for hours with those boys.

26:29.083 --> 26:31.000
It was just a stupid video game.

26:31.083 --> 26:33.000
Maybe, playtime got
boring after a while.

26:33.083 --> 26:34.458
Maybe you needed
the real deal.

26:34.542 --> 26:36.750
- Were you in on their plan?
- No!

26:36.834 --> 26:39.333
- 'Sure about that?'
- I'm leaving.

26:39.417 --> 26:40.500
Come here!

26:40.583 --> 26:45.542
Is this...
is this a game to you?

26:45.625 --> 26:47.709
Turn it off.

26:48.625 --> 26:53.041
Please. Please.

27:02.792 --> 27:04.583
I tried to stop 'em.

27:06.834 --> 27:09.333
I knew it was wrong..

27:09.417 --> 27:11.000
...what they were gonna do.

27:11.083 --> 27:13.208
- Cameron and Neal?
- 'No.'

27:15.625 --> 27:18.208
- Who?
- Zack.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.959
And the others.

27:22.625 --> 27:23.875
Your friends?

27:23.959 --> 27:26.083
What'd they have to do
with the shooting?

27:29.166 --> 27:31.625
'Cause of what happened
earlier that day.

27:33.792 --> 27:35.208
I tried to stop 'em.

27:36.500 --> 27:38.291
Maybe, if I had..

27:38.375 --> 27:41.250
...none of this
would have happened.

27:50.166 --> 27:51.500
Oh, fuck!

27:51.583 --> 27:52.750
What's going on, man?

27:52.834 --> 27:54.291
- Teddy said you guys are
back.
- Shh!

28:07.291 --> 28:08.750
(Zack)
'What's up, dudes?'

28:13.834 --> 28:15.667
- Oh!
- Ooh!

28:16.792 --> 28:18.417
Who's your daddy now?

28:24.083 --> 28:26.500
(Zack)
'Whoa, whoa, hold up there.'

28:26.583 --> 28:27.792
Where do you think
you're going to?

28:27.875 --> 28:29.291
- Stop it!
- Leave her alone, Zack.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.709
Shut up, Dayton.

28:30.792 --> 28:32.959
No. Stop it! Don't touch me.

28:33.041 --> 28:38.125
Stop it. No! No!

28:38.208 --> 28:39.792
- No! No!
- Giddyap!

28:39.875 --> 28:41.625
Stop! No!

28:41.709 --> 28:43.333
No!

28:44.417 --> 28:46.709
(Tina)
'Ow! Ow!'

28:46.792 --> 28:49.375
Stop it!
Get off of
me!

28:54.041 --> 28:56.291
(Tina)
'No! No!'

28:58.333 --> 28:59.709
Stop it! Get off!

29:00.709 --> 29:03.959
- Tina!
- Davie!

29:04.041 --> 29:05.291
Davie!

29:12.875 --> 29:16.542
Oh, Davie!
Davie!

29:21.125 --> 29:22.875
I'll kill all of you!

29:25.333 --> 29:26.583
I tried to stop them.

29:26.667 --> 29:28.750
I'm gonna put a bullet
into all your heads.

29:34.709 --> 29:36.959
I tried.

29:37.709 --> 29:39.333
(Dayton)
'I did.'

29:42.792 --> 29:44.542
When did this happen?

29:47.750 --> 29:50.667
An hour before
the shooting started.

30:01.583 --> 30:05.500
(Miller)
'A bullet in all their
heads.'

30:05.583 --> 30:07.458
You wanted them to pay.

30:07.542 --> 30:08.875
(Valens)
'Don't blame you.'

30:08.959 --> 30:11.166
Someone did that
to my girl..

30:11.250 --> 30:12.917
(Valens)
'Forget about it.'

30:13.000 --> 30:14.875
(Miller)
'So you reached out
to Cameron and Neal.'

30:14.959 --> 30:17.375
Everyone knew their plan,
knew they had guns.

30:17.458 --> 30:19.375
And you had all
the motive in the world.

30:19.458 --> 30:22.000
- I didn't do anything.
- Now, come on, Davie.

30:22.083 --> 30:25.125
These guys mauled
the girl you're in love
with?

30:25.208 --> 30:27.083
You got to settle the score.

30:32.667 --> 30:34.625
Must have hurt.

30:34.709 --> 30:36.125
'Being in love with someone..'

30:37.291 --> 30:39.458
...who didn't love you back.

30:41.500 --> 30:42.750
Yeah, it did.

30:42.834 --> 30:44.917
'But maybe, if you saved her'

30:45.000 --> 30:47.625
from the big bad wolves..

30:47.709 --> 30:48.750
...she would?

30:48.834 --> 30:51.041
- I didn't save her.
- You tried.

30:52.625 --> 30:55.083
No.

30:55.166 --> 30:56.792
You don't understand.

30:56.875 --> 30:59.583
I would have done
anything for Tina.

30:59.667 --> 31:02.667
'Cause all I ever wanted
was for her to like me.

31:02.750 --> 31:06.250
But I let her down
when she needed me the most.

31:14.250 --> 31:15.542
- Tina?
- Uh?

31:15.625 --> 31:19.291
- Are you okay?
- No, uh, just don't touch
me.

31:19.375 --> 31:20.625
Sorry.

31:22.417 --> 31:25.709
I just don't want
to be touched right now.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.041
You want a frozen
yogurt
or something?

31:45.834 --> 31:47.125
We should go to the police.

31:47.208 --> 31:49.166
The police?

31:49.250 --> 31:51.792
They'll arrest Zack
and all of them

31:51.875 --> 31:53.959
f-for what they did to you.

31:57.291 --> 31:59.166
You still like him?

31:59.250 --> 32:02.375
- No, it's not that.
- Then what?

32:05.041 --> 32:08.667
Well, I mean,
it's just that Zack..

32:08.750 --> 32:11.291
...he didn't force me, you know?

32:17.625 --> 32:20.417
Why are you looking at me
like that?

32:23.792 --> 32:25.041
Davie?

32:25.125 --> 32:26.667
Maybe..

32:26.750 --> 32:30.083
...maybe going to the
cops
isn't such a good idea.

32:31.917 --> 32:36.041
- It isn't?
- You said so yourself.

32:36.125 --> 32:38.250
You let him do it.

32:38.333 --> 32:40.542
Kind of, like
you
let everyone..

32:40.625 --> 32:42.000
...do it.

32:47.667 --> 32:49.458
So what's the big deal?

32:52.583 --> 32:55.750
Tina? Tina?

33:32.041 --> 33:35.375
I should have stopped her.

33:35.458 --> 33:37.375
But...you didn't.

33:37.458 --> 33:40.667
I didn't believe anything bad
would really happen.

33:40.750 --> 33:42.917
No one did.

33:52.083 --> 33:54.500
The boss and Lil
just headed over to the
mall.

33:54.583 --> 33:56.417
The mall? Why?

33:56.500 --> 33:58.792
Tina walked in
a few minutes
ago.

33:58.875 --> 34:00.250
With a gun.

34:06.875 --> 34:08.291
You got the area cleared?

34:08.375 --> 34:09.709
She'll be
killed
if they go
in.

34:09.792 --> 34:10.959
She's armed, Lil.
I don't have a choice.

34:11.041 --> 34:12.583
- Let me talk to her.
- No way.

34:12.667 --> 34:15.667
Tina doesn't want to
hurt
anyone but herself.

34:17.875 --> 34:20.625
If she raises the gun,
I'm not holding them back.

34:20.709 --> 34:22.458
Alright, let her through.

34:28.583 --> 34:30.333
Heads up, guys.
There's one of ours coming in.

34:59.417 --> 35:01.417
I'm going to sit down.

35:02.458 --> 35:04.625
If that's okay with you.

35:11.458 --> 35:13.333
Easy, Lil.

35:14.417 --> 35:16.959
I know why you're here, Tina.

35:17.041 --> 35:18.625
I know
what happened to you.

35:18.709 --> 35:22.417
I haven't set foot
in this place for..

35:22.500 --> 35:25.041
...for 11 years.

35:25.125 --> 35:30.000
The same music,
same kids, same
heartbreak.

35:30.083 --> 35:32.875
(Tina)
'Nothing changes.'

35:32.959 --> 35:34.750
No. It doesn't.

35:34.834 --> 35:37.709
I should have done
this
a long time ago.

35:37.792 --> 35:39.375
Like Cameron, Neal.

35:40.625 --> 35:42.208
So when does it end?

35:43.792 --> 35:45.125
The violence.

35:47.333 --> 35:51.083
I wanted to hurt
them
like they hurt me.

35:51.166 --> 35:52.959
I have to
pay
for what I
did.

35:53.041 --> 35:54.083
No.

35:58.417 --> 36:01.166
For every gun that's fired..

36:01.250 --> 36:03.375
...someone can't be
in a closed room.

36:03.458 --> 36:08.000
'Or a walk...or see
their child again.'

36:08.083 --> 36:10.792
It's not just you
who pays, Tina.

36:14.375 --> 36:16.166
It never is.

36:16.250 --> 36:17.667
I know.

36:24.208 --> 36:25.917
Give me the gun.

36:29.333 --> 36:30.750
Give me the gun.

36:48.125 --> 36:52.208
They were little kids.
They were moms and dads.

36:52.291 --> 36:57.000
And they never hurt anybody.

36:57.083 --> 36:58.625
And it didn't matter
to Cameron and Neal.

36:58.709 --> 37:00.834
They were human time bombs.

37:00.917 --> 37:03.500
Just waiting to go off.

37:06.375 --> 37:08.709
And I lit the fuse.

37:24.125 --> 37:26.417
You want to make a porn film?

37:26.500 --> 37:28.583
Bow-chicka-bow-ow.

37:29.875 --> 37:31.959
Girlfriend's seriously tweaked.

37:32.041 --> 37:33.834
Or I could film you..

37:33.917 --> 37:35.041
...killing everyone.

37:36.750 --> 37:39.250
You're always talking about
it,
right? So do it already.

37:41.375 --> 37:43.375
Okay, dawg,
let's get out of here.

37:44.583 --> 37:47.333
What, you're
scared
or something?

37:47.417 --> 37:49.542
What about I kill you first?

37:49.625 --> 37:53.500
Then who's gonna make
you famous, big boy?

37:56.333 --> 37:58.000
Girl's got a point.

38:00.250 --> 38:01.542
So what's the plan?

38:03.458 --> 38:04.750
Cameron?

38:19.625 --> 38:21.583
Kill 'em all.

38:24.709 --> 38:27.542
Kill everybody.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.083
Get the camera.

38:37.417 --> 38:38.750
Did you see his face?

38:41.792 --> 38:43.083
Everyone.

39:52.333 --> 39:54.750
This is it, bro.

39:56.709 --> 39:58.667
Then roll credits, dawg.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.417
The end.

41:15.792 --> 41:18.083
Please...wake up.

44:15.834 --> 44:17.125
