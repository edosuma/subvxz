WEBVTT

00:02.200 --> 00:04.089
<i>Previously on</i> Justified...

00:04.200 --> 00:06.680
- What about Boyd?
- Boyd ain't nothing like Bowman.

00:06.760 --> 00:07.807
Yeah, he's a Crowder.

00:07.880 --> 00:09.006
That's awful strange talk

00:09.080 --> 00:10.684
seeing as you're here
working for him.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.171
My uncle...

00:12.280 --> 00:13.805
You sure he couldn't have
made it out of that mine?

00:13.880 --> 00:15.723
Even if he survived the blast,

00:15.800 --> 00:17.609
the rockfall cut him off
from the entrance.

00:17.680 --> 00:19.205
Probably got turned around
in the dark.

00:19.480 --> 00:21.289
Zachariah got turned around?

00:21.520 --> 00:23.841
You want some advice?
Bring Raylan in.

00:23.960 --> 00:26.361
See if you can confirm
what your gut is telling you.

00:26.440 --> 00:27.680
Is that what you'd do?

00:27.760 --> 00:29.125
You'd let it go.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.926
Wouldn't risk the case
just to save your own ass.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.321
When I asked you how long you'd
been snitching to the Marshals,

00:34.400 --> 00:35.890
you said, "This time."

00:35.960 --> 00:37.530
The other time was about
Grady Hale, right?

00:37.640 --> 00:39.802
You just figured that out
all by yourself, Mikey?

00:43.880 --> 00:46.167
Miss Hale, please call me
as soon as you get this.

00:48.240 --> 00:50.891
Ripping you off...
That was her idea

00:50.960 --> 00:52.962
of payback for you murdering
her husband.

00:53.040 --> 00:54.883
I just thought
you'd ought to know.

00:55.640 --> 00:56.721
Baby?

00:58.320 --> 00:59.481
What did you do?

00:59.560 --> 01:01.688
I gave you what you
always wanted, Raylan...

01:01.840 --> 01:03.490
Boyd Crowder
bleeding at your feet.

01:03.600 --> 01:04.840
I'm going to come after you.

01:05.160 --> 01:06.321
I know.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.448
I know your deputies
just got back to Atlanta,

01:12.520 --> 01:15.205
but we need as many
as you can spare.

01:15.280 --> 01:17.362
We've got a new number one.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.127
Ava Crowder.

01:23.440 --> 01:25.408
Jerry, I'm gonna have to
call you back.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.205
How bad is it?

01:39.280 --> 01:41.567
Well, I shaved.

01:43.440 --> 01:45.204
The Director called.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.686
Tried to tell her that I was
the shot caller on this

01:48.760 --> 01:51.411
from my sickbed, that I just
couldn't let it go,

01:51.480 --> 01:53.244
but apparently you'd already
talked to her.

01:53.360 --> 01:55.283
I'm the one who approved
Ava as a CI,

01:55.360 --> 01:56.566
and Raylan as her handler.

01:57.360 --> 01:58.930
It's only right I take the hit.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.286
I wish you'd called me first.

02:01.360 --> 02:02.521
Am I suspended?

02:03.880 --> 02:05.166
Hell, no.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.642
Not gonna sideline one
of my best man hunters

02:08.720 --> 02:09.881
in the middle of a manhunt.

02:10.240 --> 02:12.561
What the hell's the status
with Crowder?

02:12.640 --> 02:15.325
Nelson's sitting on him
at Harlan Regional Medical

02:15.400 --> 02:17.360
until they get the bullet out
and we can move him.

02:17.480 --> 02:19.448
Well, you do realize you
accomplished something

02:19.520 --> 02:22.000
that I was never able to do
all these years.

02:22.120 --> 02:23.724
Let an untrustworthy CI,

02:23.800 --> 02:25.848
get away with $10 million?

02:26.760 --> 02:27.966
You got Boyd Crowder.

02:33.120 --> 02:35.168
Irrespective of
you being shot,

02:35.240 --> 02:37.971
you are what doctors call
one lucky son of a bitch.

02:38.040 --> 02:40.884
Yeah, well, I don't feel
so lucky at the moment.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.685
Slug splintered
on your collarbone.

02:43.760 --> 02:46.001
Hair south, your lungs'd
be torn to shreds.

02:46.080 --> 02:47.684
We got in there, tied things up.

02:47.760 --> 02:49.410
It could be worse.

02:50.240 --> 02:51.321
You give us a minute, Doc?

02:52.440 --> 02:53.880
You're not the one
shot him, are you?

02:53.920 --> 02:55.729
No, I'm the one
who got him here.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.887
Ain't exactly true, is it?

03:05.960 --> 03:08.486
What you told him about
bringing me here.

03:08.560 --> 03:09.641
Well, I called it in,

03:09.720 --> 03:11.051
made sure they knew
you were emergent.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.724
You handcuffed me to a bumper,

03:13.760 --> 03:16.240
you left me there without
so much as a fare thee well.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.084
You could hear
the sirens on their way.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.845
Must have given you some solace.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.645
I don't suppose you've come
to tell me you've found her.

03:25.520 --> 03:28.330
I found her truck some
down the road, abandoned.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.970
No sign beyond.

03:31.320 --> 03:34.563
Gotta suck, be that
close to the prize,

03:34.640 --> 03:36.210
have it shot out of your hand.

03:37.320 --> 03:38.560
I kinda know how you feel.

03:38.640 --> 03:39.846
No, you don't.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.649
I don't believe in a world
where you know how I feel.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.688
I didn't realize disappointment

03:43.760 --> 03:46.411
was a domain exclusive
unto Boyd Crowder.

03:46.480 --> 03:48.084
Well, Raylan, if we're
gonna play it that simple,

03:48.160 --> 03:49.844
then let's talk about
your disappointments.

03:49.920 --> 03:52.400
What disappoints you,
Raylan Givens?

03:52.480 --> 03:54.881
The fact that you weren't
the one who got to shoot me?

03:56.480 --> 03:58.209
Where is she goin?

03:58.280 --> 03:59.566
Well, you wheel me outta here,

03:59.640 --> 04:01.483
I'll take you straight to her.

04:01.560 --> 04:03.130
That's funny.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.725
Oh, well, it doesn't
have to be funny.

04:04.800 --> 04:08.771
Come on, Raylan. Me and you,
one more ride together.

04:08.840 --> 04:12.128
See if we can't find a reasonable
solution to our problem.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.521
But which is
our problem, exactly?

04:14.600 --> 04:15.681
The money or Ava?

04:16.079 --> 04:17.844
Well, ain't they
the same problem, Raylan?

04:18.240 --> 04:19.366
Are they to you?

04:21.519 --> 04:22.646
I'm gonna get outta here,
Raylan.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.603
Mmm-hmm. Sooner or later,
one way or another,

04:24.680 --> 04:26.648
I'm gonna get outta here,
and when I do,

04:26.840 --> 04:28.171
I'm gonna go get that money.

04:29.160 --> 04:31.367
Which sets me to thinking, how
long you think she's got?

04:31.840 --> 04:34.320
Long enough for you
to execute your great escape?

04:34.400 --> 04:37.131
Get to her before Markham
and his boys do?

04:37.200 --> 04:39.601
Then I got to wonderin' further
what they're gonna do to her

04:39.680 --> 04:40.806
if they get there first.

04:40.880 --> 04:42.882
Well, maybe she has
whatever that is coming.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.201
Oh.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.251
I see.
And you're cool with that?

04:50.160 --> 04:53.050
Them dishing out retribution
however they see fit?

04:53.760 --> 04:55.000
Are you?

04:59.080 --> 05:00.320
My, my.

05:02.520 --> 05:03.885
You know, Raylan.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.170
Zachariah Randolph.

05:07.560 --> 05:08.891
Come again?

05:10.720 --> 05:12.245
It's her uncle.

05:13.160 --> 05:15.049
I think that's the man
you're looking for.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.320
You think he's helping her?

05:22.400 --> 05:25.085
Well, if he ain't died down in one
of those shafts, Raylan, then...

05:26.680 --> 05:28.569
I don't believe he has.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.008
That'd be my first stop.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.889
See you at the arraignment.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.320
You get anything?

05:37.440 --> 05:38.726
Maybe a place to start.

05:38.760 --> 05:41.161
Heard she pulled Boyd's gun on you.
She did.

05:41.240 --> 05:44.130
Man, I did not see that coming.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.009
Anything changes here,
drop me a line.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.366
You ever been down in a mine?

05:47.440 --> 05:49.522
I've been to Mordor,
but not through the mines.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.170
Is that a yes or a no?
No.

06:00.600 --> 06:03.683
Is that it? Way up there?
Yeah!

06:04.080 --> 06:05.969
I thought you said it was close.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.370
How long's
this place been closed?

06:16.480 --> 06:18.084
Oh, eight, nine years.

06:18.160 --> 06:21.004
They used it a...
As a supply station.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.525
Rescue would get the supplies in

06:22.600 --> 06:24.125
to trapped miners
as fast as possible.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.490
Regulations being so damn lax,

06:27.560 --> 06:30.291
they didn't build this thing
till after the '83 collapse.

06:32.680 --> 06:34.284
You think having closer supplies

06:34.360 --> 06:36.408
would have saved my daddy?

06:37.400 --> 06:39.641
God himself couldn't
save your daddy on that day.

06:40.120 --> 06:41.884
That's why I stopped praying.

06:44.280 --> 06:45.645
Yeah, yeah.

06:52.320 --> 06:53.924
Get some heat in here.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.126
And I got...

06:57.920 --> 06:59.843
This here radio for backup.

07:00.680 --> 07:02.682
We'll know they're coming
before they do.

07:02.760 --> 07:04.205
Give us some time
to hightail it outta here,

07:04.280 --> 07:05.770
which is exactly what
we should be doing,

07:05.840 --> 07:07.080
so I'm gonna go over,
see if I can get

07:07.160 --> 07:08.525
one of those old ATVs running.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.529
Pack up these bags, and we
be outta here by sundown!

07:13.680 --> 07:15.720
Now you do know those old
moonshine trails up there,

07:15.760 --> 07:18.764
they just roll through
those mountains like a...

07:18.840 --> 07:20.524
Maze?
Yeah, maze.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.521
Now this Grubes guy
we're going to see,

07:23.600 --> 07:24.726
you sure he knows
his way around?

07:24.840 --> 07:26.604
He knows the trails blindfolded.

07:27.120 --> 07:30.249
But I was thinkin'...
Boyd knows Grubes.

07:30.320 --> 07:31.401
Ah.
If he's alive...

07:31.480 --> 07:33.721
If he's alive, the Marshals
got him, and if he ain't...

07:36.720 --> 07:38.051
The more, the better.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.490
Where are you?

08:16.280 --> 08:17.770
Damn, I can't hear you.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.966
I'm in Richmond,
close to EKU.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.849
Give me the phone, Mikey.
Let me talk to her.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.968
<i>I'll call when I get close.
Keep Duffy there.</i>

08:25.040 --> 08:27.168
I just need to get my purse.

08:33.440 --> 08:36.761
You know, loan usually smell a
rotten bud before it blooms.

08:38.039 --> 08:42.125
But your scent, my dear, has
always been Presidential Kush.

08:47.440 --> 08:49.363
Agents and their questions...

08:49.440 --> 08:52.489
Been at it all night.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.970
Got yourself a new purse.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.328
Yeah, before we go down
a whole road,

08:59.400 --> 09:01.846
I think you might be interested
in the phone call I just had,

09:01.920 --> 09:05.447
wherein I learned that
Wynn Duffy killed Grady.

09:05.520 --> 09:08.205
I didn't know that little
cockroach was still alive.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.806
Yeah. Well, I'm just
going to change that.

09:14.640 --> 09:16.130
How do you know this?

09:18.920 --> 09:20.160
His bodyguard called me.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.162
Wynn Duffy was a rat
14 years ago,

09:23.240 --> 09:25.049
and he's a rat today.

09:26.200 --> 09:30.091
You know, I knew you'd never
leave your home state.

09:30.520 --> 09:33.364
That's why I came back.
Nothing else mattered.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.130
You were the prize.

09:36.960 --> 09:39.850
But now I wonder
if I wasn't just a mark,

09:39.920 --> 09:41.490
someone for you to screw.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.485
At first, yes,

09:47.360 --> 09:48.566
but...

09:49.920 --> 09:52.730
Seeing you, being with you,

09:53.720 --> 09:55.370
everything came flying back.

09:55.640 --> 09:57.529
Oh, don't tell me.
Love?

09:59.720 --> 10:01.688
Well, was it not
the same for you?

10:02.000 --> 10:04.731
Well, I've always
loved you, Katherine.

10:05.440 --> 10:07.124
I just don't trust you.

10:09.680 --> 10:12.365
Well, I accepted
your proposal, Avery.

10:14.120 --> 10:17.203
Would it be so bad
for the two of us to

10:18.280 --> 10:21.682
live together,
not trusting each other,

10:21.760 --> 10:24.491
just like everybody else
in the whole wide world?

10:29.040 --> 10:30.644
You know,
I understand your drive

10:30.720 --> 10:32.529
to avenge Grady's death,

10:33.040 --> 10:35.407
even when you thought it was me.

10:37.920 --> 10:40.002
And I hope when
I'm your husband,

10:42.680 --> 10:44.170
you'd do the same for me.

10:52.680 --> 10:54.603
I'm gonna go shower.
You wanna join me?

10:55.920 --> 10:57.251
Nothing I'd love more.

10:57.920 --> 11:00.127
But there's work to be done.

11:01.480 --> 11:03.448
Going after your $10 million?

11:03.520 --> 11:05.124
Our $10 million.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.411
Then I'm gonna make sure
Boyd Crowder

11:09.520 --> 11:11.124
doesn't see another day.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.441
Well, I'm gonna do
the same to Wynn Duffy.

11:13.520 --> 11:14.885
Let me handle Duffy.

11:15.680 --> 11:17.728
I'll bring you his head
for a wedding present.

11:18.760 --> 11:21.604
Goddamn, Avery Markham.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.005
I love you.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.610
Love you, too.

11:36.120 --> 11:38.202
I never knew
you liked classical, Mikey.

11:39.560 --> 11:40.891
You'd know if you let me
pick the music

11:40.960 --> 11:42.121
every once in a while.

11:43.880 --> 11:45.450
That can change.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.444
A lot can change.

11:51.160 --> 11:52.844
You want me to drive sometimes?

11:54.520 --> 11:56.807
You wanna be in charge
of the TV?

11:57.800 --> 11:58.961
Mikey?

12:00.800 --> 12:02.802
What do you want, Mikey?

12:07.160 --> 12:08.810
Okay, point taken.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.845
You got a code.
You're Billy Jack.

12:10.920 --> 12:12.490
I get it, okay?

12:14.200 --> 12:16.771
Can we end this? Mikey?

12:16.880 --> 12:18.245
I'll forget what happened

12:18.320 --> 12:19.924
and we'll go back
to the way things were.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.770
Okay, Mikey?

12:22.840 --> 12:24.001
Hey!

12:24.320 --> 12:26.766
Take these goddamn cuffs off,

12:26.840 --> 12:28.490
or I'm gonna take that code,

12:28.600 --> 12:30.568
and I will shove it up your ass!

12:33.520 --> 12:35.841
This isn't just about some code.

12:35.920 --> 12:38.400
You were as close to family
as I ever had.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.609
I believed in you, Wynn.

12:40.680 --> 12:43.251
End of the day, you're a rat.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.527
And rats get exterminated,
period.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.407
And I hate being
called "Mikey."

13:05.360 --> 13:06.805
Seat buckle.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.767
I'm just looking to keep
my girl safe.

13:13.320 --> 13:15.846
Are you looking for this?

13:16.560 --> 13:18.449
Come on.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.721
When I was a kid,

13:23.800 --> 13:26.849
can't tell you how many
foster daddies I had.

13:26.920 --> 13:28.843
Angry pricks, one and all.

13:28.920 --> 13:32.163
Lay three hots and a cot
with a side of ass whupping.

13:32.680 --> 13:35.490
I come to rely solely
on my own wherewithal

13:35.560 --> 13:38.211
at a tender age,
not unlike yourself.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.722
I'm hearing tales
about all this money

13:42.840 --> 13:44.330
you supposedly got,

13:44.400 --> 13:46.846
no doubt giving you
a sense of confidence.

13:46.920 --> 13:50.322
But I can tell you what.
Markham's got a lot more.

13:52.240 --> 13:53.651
What's your point?

13:54.920 --> 13:56.922
Do you ever watch
the history channel?

13:57.800 --> 14:02.089
Days of yore, marriages weren't
about love or romance.

14:03.080 --> 14:04.969
Those sentiments
didn't even factor in.

14:05.040 --> 14:08.203
They were about alliances
to end wars,

14:08.480 --> 14:09.891
making each side stronger

14:09.960 --> 14:11.644
against enemies
they had in common.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.290
You understand?

14:13.360 --> 14:14.720
Man, I got no idea
what in the hell

14:14.760 --> 14:15.886
you're talking about.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.206
I'm saying,

14:17.280 --> 14:19.089
if I'd had a Mr. Markham
by my side back then,

14:19.160 --> 14:21.481
I'd have jumped on it as fast
as a bullet.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.281
I wanna offer you
an opportunity,

14:27.360 --> 14:28.964
tuck in with us.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.571
You say yes,

14:32.920 --> 14:35.241
we'll always
be watching your back.

14:36.520 --> 14:38.522
I don't need anybody
watching my back...

14:39.360 --> 14:41.044
Least of all, you.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.048
Got fire in your belly.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.600
What I adore most, girl.

14:47.680 --> 14:50.331
Be careful
lest it burn your brain,

14:50.400 --> 14:52.641
so you can't hear good reason.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.331
You got an escort
down the mine shaft?

15:14.400 --> 15:15.845
He's on the way
out now.

15:16.360 --> 15:18.283
Had to roust the owner
out of the bed.

15:18.360 --> 15:20.442
He was grumpy about it.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.851
Well, you can tell him
he can give me

15:21.920 --> 15:24.161
the what-for as soon
as he gets us on a coal cart.

15:24.720 --> 15:26.722
You think she could
have got down

15:26.800 --> 15:28.040
that mine shaft on her own?

15:28.120 --> 15:30.327
We think Ms. Crowder
has an accomplice

15:30.400 --> 15:31.970
worked this mine
most of his life.

15:33.640 --> 15:34.846
What's that up there?

15:36.320 --> 15:37.810
So I got the claymores set.

15:37.880 --> 15:40.884
Earl's on the AK. We got the
armored car dead in our sight.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.048
Next thing we know,
cherries, man, everywhere.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.521
I'm telling it, Earl.
All right?

15:45.960 --> 15:47.041
Sorry.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.884
How'd the cops know?

15:49.840 --> 15:51.205
Figure we got set up.

15:52.360 --> 15:53.407
By who?

15:55.120 --> 15:57.282
That Katherine chick
and Duffy...

15:57.360 --> 15:58.486
One or both of 'em.

15:59.320 --> 16:00.606
It's like that old saying,
you know?

16:00.680 --> 16:01.727
"Crime doesn't pay"?

16:01.840 --> 16:03.729
God damn it, Earl. No.

16:04.680 --> 16:06.967
"Ain't no honor
among thieves."

16:07.640 --> 16:09.210
Crime does pay.

16:10.320 --> 16:11.890
As long as the criminals
you're working for

16:11.960 --> 16:13.291
don't screw you over
all the time.

16:13.360 --> 16:15.010
Let's go, girls!

16:15.080 --> 16:16.844
You're moving to a new cell!

16:17.240 --> 16:18.446
Come on off your fannies!

16:26.680 --> 16:27.761
Not you two.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.086
You got a visitor.

16:30.800 --> 16:31.881
Who?

16:34.080 --> 16:35.286
Oh, no.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.846
Oh, hey! Hey, we can't be
in here with them!

16:38.760 --> 16:40.171
Come on now!
This shit ain't legal!

16:40.240 --> 16:42.402
Those cops
aren't gonna help you, son.

16:43.400 --> 16:44.845
They're new friends of mine.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.241
I'm gonna tell y'all
upfront right now,

16:47.360 --> 16:48.930
we ain't going down
without a fight.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.450
Jenny here
says you would.

16:56.480 --> 16:59.245
And she's had the last word
in many such a disagreement.

16:59.640 --> 17:00.766
Boon.

17:03.720 --> 17:07.281
I know Boyd is the brain
behind your attempt to rob me.

17:08.359 --> 17:09.964
You and your brother
were just pawns.

17:10.040 --> 17:11.280
We were soldiers.

17:11.359 --> 17:12.805
No, you were pawns.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.807
He sent you out to attack
that armored car

17:15.880 --> 17:18.247
while he executed
his real plan...

17:19.800 --> 17:21.643
Kidnap my fiancee,

17:22.800 --> 17:24.928
extort the $10 million that way.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.884
He screwed you both.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.201
You're lying. Boyd
wouldn't do that to us.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.441
Would he, Carl?

17:32.120 --> 17:34.327
Ever hear of judge Zeke Baron?

17:34.400 --> 17:36.368
I know of Baron's pawn shop.

17:36.440 --> 17:38.408
That's judge Zeke.
He owns it.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.323
He got an office out back.

17:41.480 --> 17:44.643
Buy enough of his junk
for double what it cost,

17:44.720 --> 17:47.405
he's amenable
to signing a release,

17:47.480 --> 17:48.641
get you OR'd.

17:49.160 --> 17:50.889
What does that
have to do with us?

17:50.960 --> 17:52.320
It means we're
getting out of here.

17:52.640 --> 17:53.920
Means you're getting
out of here.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.041
What about Earl?

17:55.120 --> 17:56.121
Yeah.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.328
Job I have
is a one-man effort, Carl.

18:01.120 --> 18:03.282
Well, why me?
Why not the hot kid?

18:04.960 --> 18:06.166
Boyd knows you.

18:06.680 --> 18:08.569
Ask him where my money is.

18:09.440 --> 18:13.081
If he knows, put a bullet
between his eyes.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.086
If he doesn't know...

18:16.600 --> 18:18.807
Put a bullet between
his eyes anyway.

18:21.440 --> 18:24.284
What if I tell you Boyd's
been good to me, huh?

18:25.680 --> 18:28.047
And I don't want your damn job.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.690
If you refuse,

18:31.120 --> 18:32.610
if you fail...

18:33.920 --> 18:36.890
Or if you run off when you
get into the outside world,

18:38.160 --> 18:39.366
then...

18:40.760 --> 18:42.888
Jenny will blow Earl a kiss.

18:43.720 --> 18:45.210
Come on...

19:48.800 --> 19:51.246
Clear.

19:51.760 --> 19:53.091
Somebody's been here.

19:53.160 --> 19:56.403
I imagine this place has
been put to all sorts of use.

19:56.480 --> 19:58.801
Kids stealing,
coming in here to hook up.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.240
It's warm in here.
You notice that?

20:00.280 --> 20:01.725
Like someone had a space heater.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.723
Drag marks right here
by the doorway.

20:04.640 --> 20:06.642
$10 million is a lot of weight.

20:06.720 --> 20:09.166
Maybe spied us, left in a hurry.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.568
If so, they ain't far,
and they ain't moving fast.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.768
We need to shift choppers
and dogs to this ridge,

20:13.840 --> 20:15.922
set a perimeter around
this point as ground zero.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.411
You got any guys you can spare?

20:17.480 --> 20:18.686
I can ask.

20:18.920 --> 20:21.161
Uh, if so, you wanna ride
on one of the helicopters?

20:21.840 --> 20:23.410
One of them's got FLIR.

20:23.480 --> 20:25.482
- Maybe get you a seat if you want.
- Definitely.

20:27.840 --> 20:29.569
<i>It's beyond bad, Chief.</i>

20:30.280 --> 20:31.805
It's career-ending...

20:32.240 --> 20:34.208
Mine, and yours.

20:35.200 --> 20:38.249
You were the one that told me
to put Raylan in the lead.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.970
Why did you call us
in here, Vasquez?

20:40.040 --> 20:41.530
Where is he?

20:42.120 --> 20:43.121
Where's who?

20:44.680 --> 20:46.011
He's working the fugitive.

20:46.560 --> 20:48.449
As the closest Deputy
to the case,

20:48.520 --> 20:49.931
he is the most likely
to find her.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.241
Oh, Jesus, Art. Seriously?

20:52.840 --> 20:54.683
I mean, really, seriously?

20:55.080 --> 20:57.811
God damn it, what, what did
he, promise you a cut?

21:02.120 --> 21:04.771
I'm gonna do you
the goddamn common courtesy

21:04.840 --> 21:07.240
of pretending I didn't hear that
shit come out of your mouth.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.289
He was banging her in the past.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.930
He's almost certainly
banging her now.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.280
His banging her in the past

21:12.360 --> 21:14.169
wrecked the criminal case
back then!

21:14.240 --> 21:16.129
And then here we are again now!

21:16.200 --> 21:17.440
History repeating itself.

21:17.520 --> 21:18.965
Then he lets her shoot his, uh,

21:19.040 --> 21:21.042
whatever the hell you want
to call, Boyd.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.771
That's convenient.
And this Marshal,

21:23.840 --> 21:26.320
whom we've defended on countless
questionable shootings,

21:26.400 --> 21:29.688
well, he decides this time,
he's gonna holster his piece,

21:29.760 --> 21:32.809
and he's just gonna wave
goodbye as she drives away.

21:34.840 --> 21:38.083
You take umbrage with me all
you want, Chief Deputy Mullen.

21:38.160 --> 21:39.810
You give me that look like you
wanna choke me right now.

21:39.880 --> 21:42.645
But eventually, the both of you
are gonna have to come to grips

21:42.720 --> 21:43.801
with the reality.

21:44.400 --> 21:46.289
And in your version of reality?

21:46.760 --> 21:48.808
Your Marshal and his girlfriend

21:48.880 --> 21:50.450
have stolen $10 million

21:50.520 --> 21:53.126
right out from under our noses.

22:14.760 --> 22:16.330
Givens.

22:16.880 --> 22:18.325
I'm about to
get on a helicopter.

22:19.440 --> 22:21.761
I need you
back in Lexington now.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.606
What? What?

22:24.920 --> 22:27.651
Hey, I ain't kidding
about the helicopter.

22:27.720 --> 22:30.883
It's hovering above my head.
Why I'm talking so loud.

22:31.280 --> 22:34.124
Let the helicopter go. Let
somebody else take a ride.

22:34.200 --> 22:35.361
I need you in the office.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.528
What'd I do?
 That's a long list.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.170
I know that tone, Art.

22:39.240 --> 22:41.720
I know it too well, as a matter of fact.
Just tell me.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.880
Vasquez has voiced a concern.

22:44.960 --> 22:47.611
<i>Raised a concern
or leveled an accusation?</i>

22:47.720 --> 22:49.961
Look, you know where
this is going. You tell me.

22:50.080 --> 22:52.811
He thinks I conspired with Ava.

22:52.880 --> 22:55.565
Oh, tell me you ain't
entertaining the notion that

22:55.640 --> 22:58.086
that is anything
other than utter horseshit.

22:58.240 --> 23:00.208
All I'm saying
is you're not giving me

23:00.280 --> 23:01.964
a leg to stand on here.

23:02.040 --> 23:03.963
I'm having trouble enough
defending your actions

23:04.040 --> 23:05.883
even absent
your and Ava's history.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.530
<i>Just let me get
on the helicopter,</i>

23:07.600 --> 23:09.045
<i>take one pass,
see if I can spot 'em.</i>

23:09.120 --> 23:10.963
They're close, Art.
I'm telling you,

23:11.080 --> 23:13.080
I can feel it. They're close.

23:14.200 --> 23:16.806
All right.
You know me so well.

23:16.880 --> 23:20.601
I'm sure you can understand
my tone when I say to you

23:20.680 --> 23:22.921
let the goddamn helicopter go

23:23.000 --> 23:26.322
and get your ass
back to Lexington right now.

23:35.160 --> 23:36.605
God damn it.

23:56.360 --> 23:57.486
Okay...

24:03.200 --> 24:05.009
Are you Deputy Dunlop?

24:05.080 --> 24:06.366
That's me.

24:06.440 --> 24:09.284
They say they got a Deputy who
wants to meet you outside.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.010
Givens, I think?

24:11.080 --> 24:13.242
I could use a coffee anyway.

24:13.320 --> 24:14.924
Keep an eye on him for me
for a minute?

24:15.000 --> 24:16.490
Oh, yeah, you bet.
Thanks.

24:31.040 --> 24:32.485
Let's go.

24:41.400 --> 24:43.971
All right, now you're gonna
have to make this look good, all right?

24:44.080 --> 24:45.730
How about you hit me?

24:45.800 --> 24:47.165
Carl?

24:47.920 --> 24:49.285
Carl.

24:49.640 --> 24:50.641
Carl?

24:54.680 --> 24:57.331
That look good enough to you,
you son of a bitch?

25:00.600 --> 25:02.045
Where's the money, Boyd?

25:02.600 --> 25:04.090
Why are you pointing
a gun at me? I'm infirm.

25:04.160 --> 25:05.525
I trusted you.

25:05.600 --> 25:07.967
You sold Earl and I out.
You set the cops on us.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.166
Who sold you that wooden nickel?

25:09.240 --> 25:11.322
Son, I had every intention
of meeting you...

25:11.560 --> 25:12.971
Don't lie to me, Boyd.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.445
Now where's the goddamn money?

25:17.040 --> 25:18.644
Carl, I'm sorry.

25:19.280 --> 25:22.204
I made a bad decision.
Trust me, son.

25:22.280 --> 25:24.328
And if I had to do it all over
again, I'd do it different.

25:24.400 --> 25:25.686
Last chance.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.603
Hey, hey.
Where is the money?

25:27.680 --> 25:31.127
God damn it, I saved your
life down in that mine.

25:34.280 --> 25:36.123
He's got my brother, Boyd.

25:36.200 --> 25:37.531
I ain't got no choice in this.

25:37.640 --> 25:39.130
Who's got your brother?
Markham?

25:40.640 --> 25:42.244
Well, damn, son,
get me outta here.

25:42.680 --> 25:44.887
Let's go get that money.
We'll get your brother.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.041
We'll kill that son of a bitch.

25:46.120 --> 25:48.771
I'll give you half of everything
that I put my hands on.

25:48.840 --> 25:49.966
Carl.

25:51.120 --> 25:56.251
Carl, I know that we have had
a bad run of luck lately,

25:56.320 --> 25:59.449
but we can change it
right now, god damn it.

25:59.520 --> 26:00.681
Contrary to everything
that's happened,

26:00.760 --> 26:03.684
I care deeply about you
and your brother.

26:05.160 --> 26:08.004
$5 million?

26:19.480 --> 26:21.482
Now go get that key, son.

26:22.200 --> 26:24.521
- Come on.
- Yeah.

26:39.360 --> 26:40.600
Throw me that jacket.

26:43.400 --> 26:44.561
Where's he now?

26:45.080 --> 26:46.570
Earl's in the jail under guard.

26:46.640 --> 26:48.160
Markham bought off
a couple dirty cops.

26:48.680 --> 26:49.966
Do anything for him.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.566
Let's go kill
that skinny son of a bitch.

26:52.640 --> 26:54.563
Question is now,
how we gonna get you out

26:54.640 --> 26:56.449
past the nurses' stand
without anybody noticing?

26:56.520 --> 26:58.568
It shouldn't be
too hard with all the chaos.

26:58.640 --> 26:59.880
What chaos?

27:06.040 --> 27:08.088
We got a shooter on the floor!

27:08.160 --> 27:09.321
Everybody clear out!

27:09.920 --> 27:12.491
- Get outta here!
- He said shooter! Come on!

27:28.240 --> 27:30.368
Where's Nelson?

27:30.440 --> 27:31.930
Somewhere wishing
he wasn't Nelson.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.490
Why didn't he get any backup?

27:33.560 --> 27:34.971
Everyone's out looking for Ava.

27:35.040 --> 27:36.280
Oh, my God.
The word I got

27:36.360 --> 27:37.771
is you're supposed to be
headed back to Lexington,

27:37.840 --> 27:39.126
face this Vasquez reckoning.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.326
Yeah, I was headed
back to Lexington.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.320
Then I got word Crowder
escaped Marshals' custody

27:42.360 --> 27:43.805
and reframed my priorities
somewhat.

27:43.880 --> 27:45.882
And creepy how excited
you seem right now,

27:45.960 --> 27:47.803
not that I am questioning
your priorities.

27:47.880 --> 27:48.960
My priorities are straight.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.321
Uh-huh. So you're gonna
keep cool when I tell you

27:51.440 --> 27:53.602
you need to follow Art's orders
and head back to Lexington.

27:53.680 --> 27:54.761
Give me something here.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.046
Point me in the direction,
couple hours.

27:56.120 --> 27:57.929
Oh, so the joke here is
that I give you directions

27:58.000 --> 27:59.764
back to Lexington, but since
you know where that is...

27:59.880 --> 28:01.325
Who is this peckerwood
here? Is this Carl?

28:01.400 --> 28:02.970
Jesus Christ, man. Carl.

28:03.040 --> 28:04.565
I know. It's weird,
isn't it?

28:04.640 --> 28:05.687
Maybe you should ask him
about that

28:05.760 --> 28:06.921
when you get back to the office.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.162
Tim, can we stop pretending
there's any version

28:09.240 --> 28:11.560
of this conversation that ends
with me going to the office?

28:12.320 --> 28:13.560
If I help you out,

28:13.640 --> 28:15.404
you gonna cut me in
on that$10 million?

28:37.360 --> 28:38.566
Got word from the hospital.

28:40.640 --> 28:42.563
Carl's dead. And...

28:42.640 --> 28:43.926
And Boyd escaped.

28:47.640 --> 28:48.880
I told Carl what would happen

28:48.960 --> 28:50.928
if he failed in his job.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.324
A deal's a deal.

28:55.280 --> 28:57.726
Call our friends at the jail.

28:57.840 --> 28:59.171
Get little brother out.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.126
Help ya?

29:13.200 --> 29:15.089
Deputy U.S. Marshal
Raylan Givens.

29:15.160 --> 29:16.764
Looking for Earl Lennon.

29:16.840 --> 29:19.730
May have him back there awaiting
Marshal's transfer back to Lexington.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.848
Oh, yeah, sure.
Great.

29:22.400 --> 29:24.323
Whatever paperwork you, uh...
Just need to, uh...

29:24.400 --> 29:25.765
Sure.

29:27.040 --> 29:29.122
Can I help you?
Hey.

29:29.760 --> 29:31.603
Look at that.
Got him all ready for me.

29:31.680 --> 29:33.125
Yeah, this prisoner's
been entrusted

29:33.200 --> 29:35.328
to my office's charge.

29:35.400 --> 29:38.200
I mean, what makes you think you can
just walk on out of here with him?

29:38.320 --> 29:41.130
Uh, this. Not to get
all federal on you,

29:41.520 --> 29:42.885
but, kinda is what it is.

29:42.960 --> 29:44.600
Yeah, well, I'm gonna
have to make a call.

29:45.720 --> 29:47.210
See? There it is.

29:47.280 --> 29:48.520
There what is?

29:48.640 --> 29:50.051
You know,
it don't bother me much

29:50.120 --> 29:52.726
running into a cop from this
town that's bent to shit.

29:53.120 --> 29:55.646
I grew up around here. Kinda
expect it now and then.

29:56.560 --> 29:59.643
What irritates me is when
you call 'em on it,

29:59.720 --> 30:01.006
and they give you
this look like,

30:01.560 --> 30:05.610
"How dare you insinuate I'm a piece
of shit tarnishing my badge?"

30:08.080 --> 30:10.048
I see you doing the math,

30:10.160 --> 30:11.760
whether you're gonna
tolerate the insult.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.764
But you should know,
one of your co-workers

30:13.840 --> 30:15.729
is in the hospital
with brain bleed,

30:16.240 --> 30:18.527
and this boy's brother's dead,

30:18.600 --> 30:20.000
so you might wanna
factor them items

30:20.040 --> 30:21.963
into the equation
before you decide

30:22.040 --> 30:23.690
what you're gonna do next.

30:23.800 --> 30:26.280
Number one,
I don't like your tone.

30:26.720 --> 30:29.690
Number two,
that badge don't mean shit.

30:30.080 --> 30:32.811
And number three. This boy's
been bonded out fair and square.

30:33.080 --> 30:35.080
Matter of fact, I was just
about to call the judge.

30:35.120 --> 30:38.841
The Marshal Service have spent
a lot of time and effort

30:38.920 --> 30:42.003
apprehending a fugitive
that's now out on the run,

30:42.080 --> 30:44.003
and lives are in danger
because of it,

30:44.080 --> 30:47.448
so every time you open your mealy
mouth to lie, I think of that,

30:48.600 --> 30:50.887
and I start
picturing how you'd look

30:50.960 --> 30:53.008
without any
of your goddamn teeth.

30:55.040 --> 30:56.121
Wait.

30:56.200 --> 30:57.690
Did you say my brother's dead?

31:06.800 --> 31:08.006
Earl...

31:08.600 --> 31:10.523
Step away from the dirty cop

31:11.400 --> 31:12.765
and come with me,

31:12.840 --> 31:14.330
nice and slow.

31:24.960 --> 31:26.325
Thank you.

31:35.880 --> 31:37.166
Hello, Michael.

31:42.120 --> 31:43.690
Hello, Ms. Hale.

31:44.480 --> 31:46.562
Michael, would you
mind giving me a gun

31:46.640 --> 31:48.563
until this unfortunate mess
is over?

31:48.640 --> 31:51.291
You can retrieve it later.
How's that sound?

31:58.200 --> 32:00.009
Thank you.

32:08.520 --> 32:09.681
Wynn...

32:10.360 --> 32:13.091
Avery wanted to give me
your murderous rat head

32:13.200 --> 32:14.804
as a wedding present,
but I thought,

32:14.880 --> 32:18.168
no, I should do something
nice for him,

32:18.240 --> 32:21.005
get our marriage started out
on the right foot.

32:22.040 --> 32:24.042
The things we do for love.

32:24.720 --> 32:27.007
You gonna put it
in a big, blue Tiffany box

32:27.080 --> 32:29.003
like that ring on your finger?

32:32.760 --> 32:34.171
You're being awfully flip

32:34.240 --> 32:35.810
for someone who's about to die.

32:35.880 --> 32:37.609
What do you want me
to say, Katherine?

32:37.680 --> 32:40.047
Yes, I ratted out Grady
to Simon Poole

32:40.120 --> 32:44.170
and, yes, I killed Simon
Poole because Simon Poole

32:44.240 --> 32:46.242
was gonna rat me out to Grady.

32:46.360 --> 32:47.725
The life we chose, huh?

32:50.000 --> 32:51.365
Why kill Grady?

32:51.640 --> 32:53.051
What do you care?

32:53.600 --> 32:55.967
You were schtupping Markham.

32:56.040 --> 32:58.168
You think about it,
I did you a favor.

32:58.240 --> 32:59.446
Yeah.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.411
Yeah, maybe you did.

33:03.560 --> 33:04.641
But, Wynn...

33:06.120 --> 33:08.771
Grady was my husband.

33:08.880 --> 33:10.370
He was my partner.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.964
And here's how it works.

33:13.040 --> 33:14.804
You protect your partner,

33:15.400 --> 33:18.244
and you avenge them against
people who do them wrong.

33:18.320 --> 33:20.721
That is something
I strongly believe.

33:35.480 --> 33:36.641
Front of the head?

33:37.080 --> 33:38.764
Or back?

33:43.760 --> 33:45.683
- Suit yourself.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

33:46.240 --> 33:47.526
- We don't have to kill him.
- Michael.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.090
Just put the word out
he's a rat.

33:49.400 --> 33:50.760
Let him fend for himself
out there.

33:50.840 --> 33:52.251
- Move aside.
- Look, I don't like

33:52.320 --> 33:54.209
what Duffy did,
but he's my boss,

33:54.520 --> 33:57.126
and I'd have to avenge him,
anybody did him wrong.

33:57.240 --> 33:59.208
- That's what you just said, right?
- Oh, for God's sake.

33:59.280 --> 34:01.248
I mean, I think he's...

34:05.960 --> 34:07.121
Mikey!

34:10.120 --> 34:11.485
Jesus Christ!

34:12.639 --> 34:13.880
Jesus!

34:25.719 --> 34:26.880
Mikey!

34:33.840 --> 34:35.649
Mikey!

35:07.840 --> 35:10.081
Mikey. Mikey.

35:12.200 --> 35:13.850
Will you hold me?

35:15.920 --> 35:17.126
Yeah.

35:21.880 --> 35:23.723
It's okay. Shh.

35:25.600 --> 35:27.284
Shh!

35:27.880 --> 35:28.961
Shh!

36:04.400 --> 36:06.687
911.
<i>What is your emergency?</i>

36:08.520 --> 36:10.204
I'm not sure where to start.

36:30.560 --> 36:32.483
Nice hat.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.283
You take that off
that dude at the diner?

36:37.200 --> 36:38.725
That one didn't appeal to me.

36:39.320 --> 36:42.403
Smelled like patchouli
and scared hipster.

36:43.120 --> 36:46.044
No. I had this one
made custom.

36:46.720 --> 36:48.006
And it cost me a pretty penny.

36:49.320 --> 36:50.890
Say you like it, though?

36:52.200 --> 36:53.281
I do.

36:54.720 --> 36:57.690
It may be the only thing I like
about you right about now.

36:58.840 --> 37:00.683
Now, get out of my way.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.480
I didn't come here
to talk about hats.

37:10.800 --> 37:12.325
This is my favorite part.

37:13.800 --> 37:16.041
Don't you just love this part?

37:20.440 --> 37:23.091
Can hear a goddamn pin drop.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.729
Boon, let him back.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.002
Check my balls right now.

37:39.080 --> 37:40.844
Be purple, they're so blue.

37:43.880 --> 37:45.211
You stay where I can see you.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.090
I'll be brief.

37:51.160 --> 37:53.288
I got a kid in my car
who's nervous

37:53.360 --> 37:55.840
being this close to the Portal.

37:55.960 --> 37:58.122
I got no idea
what you're talking about.

37:58.200 --> 37:59.929
It's all right.
Time comes,

38:00.200 --> 38:03.044
you and Earl both
can tell it to the judge.

38:03.120 --> 38:05.964
The song he's singing about
how his brother got dead...

38:06.040 --> 38:08.327
Enough to put you away
for a good stretch.

38:08.400 --> 38:09.686
So, to that end,

38:10.720 --> 38:13.007
you are gonna leave off
chasing after that money.

38:13.240 --> 38:15.402
You, your shit-heel
cop army,

38:15.520 --> 38:17.124
anybody else you got involved,

38:17.200 --> 38:20.204
and you are definitely gonna
abandon any thoughts you got

38:20.280 --> 38:22.203
of causing harm
to the lady stole it.

38:23.240 --> 38:25.971
You misread
my intentions, Deputy.

38:27.040 --> 38:30.123
I got no cause to engage
in that kind of behavior,

38:30.560 --> 38:32.961
poison my own well

38:33.080 --> 38:36.641
when I'm just starting to
feel like I'm home at last,

38:37.400 --> 38:40.006
setting down roots
with my lady friend.

38:40.080 --> 38:41.320
Your lady friend?

38:41.400 --> 38:43.562
She and I are gonna
own this county, son.

38:44.080 --> 38:46.606
The town you grew up in.

38:46.720 --> 38:48.563
Street you rode your bike down.

38:48.920 --> 38:49.967
You don't know.

38:50.720 --> 38:51.801
Don't know what?

38:54.760 --> 38:55.886
Mr. Markham,

38:57.360 --> 38:58.930
your lady friend is dead

39:00.200 --> 39:02.089
as of a half-hour ago.

39:03.840 --> 39:05.683
Went pretty badly,
as I understand it,

39:05.760 --> 39:09.287
in the confines of a motor
coach belonging to Wynn Duffy.

39:14.160 --> 39:15.321
All this

39:17.080 --> 39:18.411
is on you.

39:20.360 --> 39:22.089
As you undertake your grieving,

39:23.400 --> 39:24.606
may that guide you,

39:24.960 --> 39:27.042
as you contemplate
your next move.

39:29.120 --> 39:30.451
Gentlemen.

39:42.800 --> 39:44.564
Hey, what you doing back there?

39:45.160 --> 39:47.049
You fall asleep?
You trying to get me shot?

39:47.520 --> 39:49.249
You think
they're gonna shoot you?

39:49.320 --> 39:51.084
Shit, maybe I should stand away.

39:55.160 --> 39:56.685
Do we have to do this
right here?

39:57.640 --> 40:00.246
I could haul him in for his threat to you.
You know that, right?

40:00.320 --> 40:02.004
Well, then I got
to testify against him?

40:02.400 --> 40:04.926
That is how the justice
system works, yes.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.411
Well, the hell with that.

40:06.480 --> 40:08.687
That old prick
killed my brother.

40:08.800 --> 40:11.121
I ain't about to be snitchin'
from no witness stand

40:11.200 --> 40:14.010
when I could just as easily put a
goddamn gun in his mouth later.

40:24.520 --> 40:25.931
Hey, dumb-ass.
What?

40:26.000 --> 40:29.561
Talking that way, now I can
take you in for the same shit.

40:29.640 --> 40:31.369
Well, so do it then.

40:31.440 --> 40:33.966
You're just about a stiff-neck
little son of a bitch, ain't you?

40:34.040 --> 40:35.326
Yeah, I guess so.

40:35.400 --> 40:36.765
Yeah. Yeah.

40:40.240 --> 40:41.287
So what now?

40:41.360 --> 40:43.089
What now?
I drop you someplace,

40:43.160 --> 40:44.764
call you in as a pick-up
for the locals,

40:44.840 --> 40:47.320
hope you don't end up in the same
jail cell as you were before.

40:47.360 --> 40:49.283
No, no, wait, wait, now, shit.

40:49.360 --> 40:51.442
Or I could drop you off
similarly,

40:51.520 --> 40:53.204
only call in
the Marshal Service,

40:53.280 --> 40:55.931
put you in PC, make sure he
don't get anywhere near you.

40:56.360 --> 40:58.806
How's testifying sound
to you now? Hmm?

41:01.040 --> 41:02.724
He was my brother.

41:03.200 --> 41:05.089
He was my only brother.

41:06.440 --> 41:09.046
I understand.
Take your time.

41:17.800 --> 41:19.165
You know, you asked me earlier

41:19.240 --> 41:21.811
if I ever heard anything
about what the plan was.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.405
Mmm-hmm.
You know, after,

41:23.480 --> 41:25.403
with Boyd and Ava and the money.

41:26.360 --> 41:27.725
And?

41:27.800 --> 41:30.690
Well, I never heard
anything about that,

41:30.800 --> 41:34.486
but when they were trying to
smuggle that Walker dude out,

41:35.360 --> 41:37.249
they mentioned two things...

41:38.080 --> 41:40.287
Pig shit trucks, and Grubes.

41:40.600 --> 41:42.762
Somebody named Grubes.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.205
Come on.

41:57.240 --> 41:58.844
Guess we wait
till he comes back.

41:59.120 --> 42:00.565
In this cold?

42:06.280 --> 42:07.406
Come on in!

42:25.960 --> 42:27.610
Damn, what's that stink?

42:27.680 --> 42:29.569
Ohm

42:32.920 --> 42:34.126
Grubes?

42:36.640 --> 42:39.086
Oh, no, no, no.
No...

42:40.480 --> 42:41.527
No!

43:08.600 --> 43:10.762
<i>Tell me
you're on your way in.</i>

43:10.840 --> 43:12.524
Yeah. You got
a locator on the car.

43:12.600 --> 43:14.364
You'll find a kid in it
I picked up.

43:14.440 --> 43:16.283
He used to work for Boyd.
You should put him in PC.

43:16.360 --> 43:17.850
He'll give you some good
charges on Markham,

43:17.920 --> 43:20.446
<i>he pulls his head out of his
ass long enough to do it.</i>

43:20.520 --> 43:22.409
Or you could honor
the responsibility

43:22.480 --> 43:24.403
that comes with wearing
that badge

43:24.480 --> 43:27.450
and bring him when you come back here
right now like you were ordered.

43:27.560 --> 43:29.608
No, I'm coming back
when I get Boyd

43:29.680 --> 43:31.489
or Ava and the money,
or all three.

43:33.640 --> 43:35.165
Are you sure
you want to do this?

43:35.240 --> 43:38.210
<i>I don't see as I
got a choice. Do you?</i>

43:38.840 --> 43:41.161
Art, you see
where I got a choice?

43:41.240 --> 43:43.288
<i>You got 48 hours, Raylan.</i>

43:43.360 --> 43:44.646
That's all I can give you.

43:44.720 --> 43:46.961
48 hours, bullshit.

43:47.040 --> 43:49.486
- Who you got coming after me?
- Everybody?

43:49.560 --> 43:51.688
<i>You got too high
an opinion of yourself.</i>

43:51.760 --> 43:53.524
<i>Of course, you always have.</i>

43:53.600 --> 43:55.489
<i>Everybody's out
looking for Boyd.</i>

43:56.600 --> 43:58.921
I'll be the one
coming after you.
