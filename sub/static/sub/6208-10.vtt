00:01.424 --> 00:03.076
Okay, here goes.

00:05.442 --> 00:07.716
- Oh not again!
- You're getting better.

00:07.717 --> 00:09.795
- I stink
- Yeah, but you're getting better.

00:09.796 --> 00:11.609
This time just try to hit it a little higher,

00:11.610 --> 00:13.671
a little straighter and a little further.

00:15.835 --> 00:17.273
Or any one of those.

00:17.274 --> 00:19.517
It's these stupid birdies, why won't they fly?

00:21.786 --> 00:22.875
Sorry!..

00:23.509 --> 00:25.196
Do I get any points for that?

00:28.979 --> 00:32.575
1x10: Sweet & Sour Victory

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

00:48.588 --> 00:51.810
To review.
Bone is composed primarily of what?

00:52.417 --> 00:55.226
Come on, it's written on the board behind me.

00:55.427 --> 00:59.247
CALCIUM! I just told you kids five minutes ago,
don't you listen?

00:59.448 --> 01:00.885
That you heard.

01:01.086 --> 01:03.683
Okay, for homework tonight read chapter fifteen

01:03.684 --> 01:06.532
and reread chapter fourteen, it's for your own good.

01:06.533 --> 01:08.839
- Sr. can I say something?
- What is it Sabrina?

01:08.840 --> 01:10.444
A bones hardness is derived mainly from calcium

01:10.445 --> 01:12.145
phosphate and calcium carbonate

01:12.190 --> 01:14.555
with small amounts of fluorides,
sulphate's and chlorides.

01:14.556 --> 01:17.824
You listened to what I said,
why didn't you raise your hand?

01:17.825 --> 01:19.850
It's never enough for you, is it?

01:24.197 --> 01:25.239
Your point?

01:25.240 --> 01:28.848
I just found out they're offering Kung Fu
as a PE elective, isn't that cool?

01:28.849 --> 01:30.449
What about Badminton?

01:30.450 --> 01:32.915
Well Badminton won't register
these as lethal weapons.

01:32.916 --> 01:34.609
Well you said I should register my racket?

01:34.610 --> 01:36.577
Well you've gotta learn to hold on to that thing.

01:36.578 --> 01:38.392
But it's hard, I'm not a jock like you.

01:38.393 --> 01:39.822
I mean you probably have a ton of these.

01:39.823 --> 01:43.312
Eighteen is not a ton,
and besides it's no big deal.

01:43.413 --> 01:46.476
Trophies are just a symbol
of superiority and greatness.

01:46.477 --> 01:48.126
Oh and who'd want one of those?

01:48.816 --> 01:50.804
I think next semester
I'm going to take basket ball,

01:50.805 --> 01:52.895
that way I can get some
reading done on the bench.

01:52.896 --> 01:56.170
Actually I was hoping you'd take Kung Fu with me.

01:56.471 --> 01:58.321
Really? That'd be fun.

02:00.432 --> 02:01.472
Sorry.

02:08.638 --> 02:10.667
I think that deserves a round of applause.

02:11.940 --> 02:13.003
I said!

02:16.564 --> 02:19.679
Please Hilda, we're on our last vase.

02:19.780 --> 02:22.488
But I'm rehearsing for the
biggest audition of my career,

02:22.489 --> 02:24.307
I need all the encouragement I can get.

02:25.359 --> 02:26.442
There.

02:26.857 --> 02:31.335
Now take a break, you've been practising
that same piece since Mozart wrote it.

02:31.336 --> 02:35.394
No one plays it better than Gustav Von Hagle,
he's the one I have to beat.

02:35.495 --> 02:37.118
Hi aunties, I'm home.

02:37.119 --> 02:38.103
Hi.

02:38.104 --> 02:41.209
Wow, pretty roses and nice arrangement.

02:41.210 --> 02:43.699
They're from my loyal but imaginary fans.

02:43.700 --> 02:44.971
Did you have fun in school?

02:44.972 --> 02:47.654
Yeah, Harvey asked me to take Kung Fu with him.

02:47.655 --> 02:49.199
Isn't that sweet.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.211
I just hope I don't maim him.
Will one of you sign my permission slip?

02:52.212 --> 02:54.220
You do it, I have to protect my hands.

02:55.655 --> 02:56.897
What are we doing?

02:56.898 --> 02:59.564
I think this music is supposed to psych us up

02:59.565 --> 03:02.038
but it's not exactly 'We will rock you.'

03:05.628 --> 03:06.856
Whaaa! Good'ay students.

03:06.857 --> 03:07.857
Mr. Pool?!

03:08.158 --> 03:11.726
I am you sifu and I will be teaching you PE.

03:11.727 --> 03:13.969
So if you'll all please rise to your feet.

03:13.970 --> 03:16.244
I can't believe Mr. Pool knows Kung Fu.

03:16.245 --> 03:19.063
I can, think about how much he
was probably beat up as a kid.

03:19.164 --> 03:22.091
Now we'll begin out class
with the customary bow

03:22.092 --> 03:24.116
to show respect for your er sifu.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.198
Come on, it's tradition.

03:29.515 --> 03:31.392
Now we'll begin with some breathing exercises designed..

03:31.393 --> 03:33.273
to help you locate your chi,

03:33.274 --> 03:35.284
and no that's not something you left in your locker.

03:36.364 --> 03:39.159
ha ha. Er no, chi is inner strength,

03:39.160 --> 03:43.884
so everybody breath in.
And out.

03:43.885 --> 03:46.128
Wow, this is easier than Badminton.

03:47.712 --> 03:49.322
Not that Badminton's easy.

03:49.523 --> 03:52.726
Okay, I'm going to need a er volunteer,
so can I see a show of hands?

03:53.701 --> 03:56.518
No one?
Jeez, Am I teaching a biology?

03:56.719 --> 03:59.812
Mr. Pool, I'll give ageless wisdom a shot.

03:59.813 --> 04:00.813
Thank you.

04:00.814 --> 04:04.280
Now er together we're going to demonstrate
the philosaphy of the river and the rock.

04:04.564 --> 04:05.776
Which do you wanna be?

04:05.777 --> 04:08.206
The rock obviously.
Nothing can move a rock.

04:09.079 --> 04:10.296
Western thinking.

04:10.562 --> 04:14.087
Okay, Sabrina will be the rock,
I'll be the river,

04:14.088 --> 04:16.800
we'll see which one is stronger. We bow.

04:17.968 --> 04:19.015
And go.

04:21.271 --> 04:23.367
- You tripped me!
- The river tripped you.

04:23.932 --> 04:27.514
The river always beats the rock
because the river has great inner strength.

04:27.515 --> 04:29.388
Oh maybe the rock has great inner strength too

04:29.389 --> 04:30.995
but just didn't have a chance to use it.

04:30.996 --> 04:32.765
Huh, the rock is slow and heavy.

04:32.766 --> 04:33.973
The rivers all wet.

04:34.557 --> 04:36.003
The rock wants a rematch.

04:36.004 --> 04:37.204
The river's game.

04:37.405 --> 04:38.915
What are they talking about?

04:39.016 --> 04:40.016
We bow.

04:41.009 --> 04:42.035
and go.

04:44.218 --> 04:45.634
A:ha, very smart. You see..

04:48.121 --> 04:49.419
The rock wins.

04:49.585 --> 04:52.054
And er that's the proper way to fall.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.927
- All right, two out of three.
- You've got it.

05:08.311 --> 05:10.191
I didn't know Sabrina could do that!

05:32.287 --> 05:33.644
No maz! no maz!

05:37.100 --> 05:38.856
Open the door Sabrina, my hands.

05:39.496 --> 05:40.732
It's Mr. Pool! Duck!

05:42.450 --> 05:44.900
You see the reason I'm here is.
Well today in Kung Fu, um..

05:44.901 --> 05:47.228
Actually I think it's better
if you hear this from me.

05:47.646 --> 05:51.195
Today in Kung Fu I kicked
Mr. Pool's butt.

05:51.296 --> 05:52.496
Sabrina, you didn't!

05:52.597 --> 05:56.145
I've never seen such natural gifts,
which is why I'm here.

05:56.146 --> 05:58.155
er Sabrina, are you at all interested in glory?

05:58.156 --> 06:00.054
Mm I could go for some glory.

06:00.237 --> 06:02.455
There's a Kung Fu competition
in Boston next week

06:02.456 --> 06:05.113
and I think you have the potential
to make some waves in the river.

06:05.114 --> 06:07.380
Aren't we getting a little ahead of ourselves?

06:07.381 --> 06:11.446
She's had one class in a public school,
she can't be ready for competition.

06:11.447 --> 06:14.124
But I am, I can prove it.
Wanna see me flip Mr. Pool again?

06:14.125 --> 06:15.125
- Yes.
- No.

06:15.126 --> 06:16.542
that won't be necessary.

06:16.980 --> 06:18.650
So can she go?

06:19.006 --> 06:21.409
Well, it's up to her.

06:21.510 --> 06:22.910
- Okay.
- Great.

06:22.911 --> 06:25.804
I'll just file the necessary paperwork
then swing by my HMO

06:25.805 --> 06:29.006
for a quick CAT scan to make sure
this ringing in my ears is no big deal.

06:29.264 --> 06:32.234
Er see you tomorrow. Hopefully
without all these spots.

06:33.031 --> 06:34.035
See ya.

06:36.142 --> 06:38.735
Whoo:hoo! I think I've found my sport!
Yes! I'm a jock!

06:41.825 --> 06:43.496
Pretend you didn't see that.

06:45.671 --> 06:46.893
She seems happy.

06:46.894 --> 06:50.588
All a little too easy, I smell a rat.

06:50.589 --> 06:54.166
Ooh a Rat! Oh wait,
I had Rat for lunch.

06:59.631 --> 07:00.713
Cute.

07:01.930 --> 07:02.970
And deadly.

07:06.780 --> 07:07.826
You knocked?

07:07.827 --> 07:09.082
Can we come in?

07:09.083 --> 07:11.301
All door are open on
the path to enlightenment.

07:11.491 --> 07:12.753
I'll take that as a yes.

07:12.854 --> 07:17.297
Sabrina we have a question,
Mr. Pool spoke of your natural gifts

07:17.298 --> 07:20.832
and we were wondering are they
truly natural or supernatural?

07:20.833 --> 07:22.589
You mean did I use my magic?

07:22.590 --> 07:25.202
Bare in mind. We're not
accusing, we're just asking.

07:25.203 --> 07:27.283
- Well I did.
- How could you!

07:27.284 --> 07:28.571
What were you thinking?

07:28.572 --> 07:30.800
I thought you wanted me
to use my magic more?

07:30.801 --> 07:33.348
We do but not when you
compete against mortal's,

07:33.349 --> 07:36.044
then your magic gives you an unfair advantage.

07:36.045 --> 07:37.894
That's why I've been practicing so hard.

07:37.895 --> 07:41.705
I wanna win first chair not because
I'm a witch but because I have talent.

07:41.706 --> 07:44.303
But I don't have talent
in fact I stink at sports.

07:44.304 --> 07:46.614
Well have you tried something easy
like Badminton?

07:48.604 --> 07:50.284
Look, are you saying I can't do this?

07:50.455 --> 07:54.070
We're saying let you
conscience be your guide.

07:54.529 --> 07:57.411
Use your moral compass,
or you can borrow mine.

07:58.089 --> 07:59.158
Here try it.

08:07.292 --> 08:08.493
How accurate is this?

08:08.799 --> 08:11.060
We'll leave you alone to think about that.

08:12.098 --> 08:14.353
- Zelda, the door.
- Oh stop it.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.872
I saw you cracking walnuts earlier.

08:19.401 --> 08:21.271
Let your conscience be your guide.

08:21.272 --> 08:24.091
I hate when they say that,
now I have no idea what to do.

08:24.092 --> 08:26.358
You should consider the pros and cons.

08:26.359 --> 08:30.891
I use my magic, I win,
without it, I lose.

08:31.046 --> 08:34.126
Win, lose. Win, lose. I'm going with win!

08:34.318 --> 08:35.985
North Eastern Regional
Kung Fu Championships

08:40.273 --> 08:42.534
Wow! Some of these guys are really big.

08:42.535 --> 08:45.971
Yeah, I wish we had trained more.
Y'know beyond the breathing exercises.

08:45.972 --> 08:49.250
I'll be fine Mr. Pool. Don't forget,
I have my inner strength.

08:49.251 --> 08:52.988
And don't forget. I have a permission
slip signed by your legal guardian:n:n:ns!

08:53.925 --> 08:57.225
I know him, that's the bad guy
from the movie 'Dragon Killer'

08:57.391 --> 09:01.851
His name is Tai Wai Tse and he's
a great fighter with a colossal chi.

09:01.852 --> 09:04.395
Last time I saw him he was
impaled on pungee sticks,

09:04.396 --> 09:05.696
he looks good.

09:05.794 --> 09:07.054
Will I be doing combat with him?

09:07.055 --> 09:09.051
Only if you win all three of your matches.

09:09.052 --> 09:11.909
So let's just focus and concentrate
on your first opponent.

09:11.910 --> 09:13.610
Right, focus and concentrate.

09:14.681 --> 09:17.636
Focus and concentrate.
Focus and concentrate.

09:18.894 --> 09:21.171
Oh Harvey you made it.

09:22.349 --> 09:23.878
I couldn't miss your big match.

09:23.879 --> 09:28.220
I mean it's amazing all the progress
you've made in the past... two days.

09:28.221 --> 09:31.280
Oh well er Mr. Pool's a great teacher.

09:31.677 --> 09:34.090
Well listen. There's something
I want to say to you that,

09:34.091 --> 09:36.558
it's something I always wish my dad
would say to me before a game.

09:37.317 --> 09:40.618
It doesn't matter if you win or  lose,
you're still a winner to me.

09:41.630 --> 09:42.665
Thanks.

09:45.742 --> 09:48.352
Now excuse me Harvey,
I've gotta go kick some butt.

10:24.584 --> 10:31.169
So Tiger Balm, you killed my Brother,
you killed my father

10:31.170 --> 10:33.560
and now you've come for me,
but you will not succeed.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.168
What are you talking about?

10:35.169 --> 10:36.979
That's what the guy said
at the end of 'Dragon Killer'

10:36.980 --> 10:39.005
Y'know right before he tossed
you on the pungee sticks?

10:39.420 --> 10:43.693
Oh yeah, pungee sticks, that was fun.
Are you ready to get this over with?

10:43.694 --> 10:45.615
Aren't we supposed to spar verbally first?

10:45.616 --> 10:50.516
Only in the movies.
Now it is time for me to defeat you.

10:50.517 --> 10:53.004
You can try but you will not succeed.

10:59.808 --> 11:02.142
If the vendor comes by, order me an I.C.

11:40.520 --> 11:42.478
The winner is Sabrina!

11:42.479 --> 11:45.450
Way to go!
I eat lunch with her!

11:46.593 --> 11:47.974
Oh, um troféu!

11:47.975 --> 11:51.235
Oh a trophy!
I have a trophy. Is this real gold?

11:54.587 --> 11:56.278
It's such a great trophy Salem.

11:56.694 --> 12:00.157
Look it says first and it's got
that little gold guy on top.

12:00.302 --> 12:03.011
It really is the best trophy and look.

12:05.650 --> 12:07.305
It comes up past my knee,

12:08.618 --> 12:10.194
and you know what else occurs to me?

12:10.195 --> 12:11.599
Is it about the trophy?

12:11.600 --> 12:14.840
I just realised I can retire now
because I'm not greedy.

12:14.841 --> 12:16.660
I just wanted one trophy
and now I've got one.

12:16.661 --> 12:19.226
Oh. I'm glad it all worked out,
now go to sleep.

12:19.327 --> 12:22.179
Okay. Trophy, trophy, trophy. I'm done.

12:28.568 --> 12:28.890
Cheater!

12:29.710 --> 12:31.598
- What?
- Cheater!

12:33.664 --> 12:34.922
Salem, what did you say?

12:34.923 --> 12:37.126
I didn't say anything. It came from over there.

12:37.127 --> 12:38.387
Over where?

12:38.388 --> 12:39.589
By your trophy.

12:40.815 --> 12:41.840
My trophy?

12:42.425 --> 12:43.432
Cheater!

12:45.156 --> 12:46.253
O meu troféu!

12:48.834 --> 12:51.446
- Did you say something?
- Cheater!

12:51.742 --> 12:52.807
What is this about?

12:52.808 --> 12:56.027
You didn't deserve to win me,
you used magic.

12:56.028 --> 12:58.715
Hey lay off you gold plated mantle warmer.

12:58.716 --> 13:01.419
Don't start with me tabby,
I'll take you out with a single blow.

13:01.420 --> 13:03.443
- I'll mess you up!
- You're going down!

13:03.444 --> 13:04.795
Stop it both of you.

13:05.274 --> 13:06.715
Now can we discus this in the morning?

13:06.716 --> 13:08.736
Sure we can discuss this in the morning,

13:08.737 --> 13:11.029
but I'm not going to shut up tonight.
Cheater! Cheater!

13:12.346 --> 13:13.977
Cheater! Cheater! Cheater!

13:13.978 --> 13:15.404
Shh! you'll wake up my aunts.

13:16.059 --> 13:17.532
- They're asleep?
- Yes.

13:17.533 --> 13:19.219
CHEATER! CHEATER!

13:19.220 --> 13:20.856
You leave me with no alternative.

13:20.857 --> 13:23.028
Cheater! Cheater!
Cheater! Cheater!

13:23.473 --> 13:25.040
Oh, now you're making me mad!

13:27.427 --> 13:28.760
What's all the noise?

13:28.761 --> 13:29.990
Everything okay?

13:29.991 --> 13:32.067
No! My trophy won't shut up.

13:32.068 --> 13:33.863
Well just tell it to... Huh?

13:33.864 --> 13:36.100
It keeps calling me names.
I don't know what's happening.

13:36.787 --> 13:39.804
I take it you decided to compete in Kung Fu?

13:39.805 --> 13:41.827
Yeah and she won. Cheater!

13:42.741 --> 13:47.208
That explains it. The trophy
is speaking your guilty conscience.

13:47.582 --> 13:49.480
You told me to decide for myself and I did.

13:49.481 --> 13:50.758
And you decided wrong.

13:50.759 --> 13:52.393
How do I get it to stop yapping?

13:52.394 --> 13:55.095
Well you could put a teeny
weeny sock in his mouth,

13:55.357 --> 13:57.176
or you could clear your conscience.

13:58.412 --> 13:59.645
I have a better idea.

14:04.955 --> 14:06.781
What? That's where I was planning to keep it.

14:10.195 --> 14:11.670
Here's our champion huh!

14:13.380 --> 14:16.008
Sabrina, I bow to your greatness.

14:16.009 --> 14:17.498
Please, don't.

14:17.499 --> 14:20.779
No you deserve it. Not many
people could compete the way you did.

14:21.153 --> 14:23.509
- That's true.
- So, where's your trophy?

14:23.510 --> 14:27.132
At home in the freezer...
with er all our other valuables.

14:27.469 --> 14:29.910
Don't you wanna show it off in the trophy case?

14:30.086 --> 14:32.255
No. It's really not that great a trophy.

14:32.256 --> 14:34.087
are you kidding, it comes up to your knee?

14:34.088 --> 14:35.929
Besides, that trophy says you're the best.

14:36.462 --> 14:41.376
Well that may be what it says to you
but it's not what it says to me.

14:43.910 --> 14:45.910
- Hilda.
- Gustav.

14:46.011 --> 14:48.906
How nice to see you. What are you doing here?

14:49.455 --> 14:52.127
Auditioning for first chair same as you.

14:52.449 --> 14:55.617
No, not same as me.
You never play same as me.

14:56.216 --> 14:58.053
Hello Stradi

14:58.497 --> 15:00.324
You have a Stradivarius?

15:00.325 --> 15:02.550
Yes, that other job I beat you out

15:02.551 --> 15:06.062
for payed me well enough to buy it..
and a case.

15:06.347 --> 15:08.384
Well you're not going to beat me this time.

15:08.385 --> 15:14.232
Oh no? I think I vill, I think you are fine
for veddings, Bah Mitzvahs..

15:14.233 --> 15:20.736
Hoe:downs but being
first chair requires skill, talent, me.

15:20.737 --> 15:24.400
You know, I've got my fans too
and they think this is my year.

15:24.401 --> 15:26.483
Give it up. There's nothing you can do.

15:26.484 --> 15:27.895
Oh yes there is.

15:27.896 --> 15:32.550
What, you going to cry like a little baby?
boo:hoo, chose me!

15:32.999 --> 15:34.810
No I'm not going to cry.

15:35.897 --> 15:39.699
I'm going to go in there and play
like I've never played before.

15:39.700 --> 15:41.845
That would be a excellent idea.

15:55.126 --> 15:57.352
I take it the audition didn't go well.

15:57.353 --> 16:00.689
Gustav got first, I got second.

16:00.690 --> 16:03.946
I'm so sorry. Should I notify the weather service?

16:03.947 --> 16:04.947
No.

16:06.628 --> 16:09.153
There, now it's out of my system.

16:10.397 --> 16:11.418
Hi guys.

16:11.419 --> 16:12.419
- Hi.
- Hey.

16:12.559 --> 16:15.232
You'll be happy to know
I'm ready to do the right thing.

16:15.233 --> 16:17.062
Oh Sabrina that's great.

16:17.397 --> 16:18.591
I did the right thing.

16:18.592 --> 16:20.417
Oh yeah, your audition.
How did it go?

16:20.418 --> 16:21.662
Yeah, They did the right thing.

16:21.790 --> 16:23.615
So did you get first chair?

16:23.616 --> 16:27.490
No, I got second chair but I tried my hardest,

16:27.491 --> 16:30.374
and second chair is even better than first chair

16:30.375 --> 16:34.017
when you think about it over
and over until words lose all meaning.

16:34.021 --> 16:37.931
You can drop it aunt Hilda,
I've already decided to give back the trophy.

16:39.244 --> 16:41.502
Ch:ch:ch:cheater:r:r! Ch:ch:ch:cheat:ter:r!:!

16:41.503 --> 16:45.730
Okay, I was going to run you under the
hot water but now you get nothing.

16:47.237 --> 16:49.854
I'm tired of playing the ninja assassin..

16:50.224 --> 16:53.732
I know Marty, look I just want to
play the dad on a phone commercial.

16:55.097 --> 16:58.534
Yeah, work on it. Look, I gotta go.
Someone's at the door. love you, chow.

17:01.644 --> 17:04.728
Hi Tai. You er probably don't remember me.

17:04.729 --> 17:08.541
Yeah like so many little blonde girls kick
my butt that I can't keep them straight.

17:08.542 --> 17:09.742
You're Sabrina right?

17:10.153 --> 17:12.997
Yeah. I:I came to bring you this.
I think you should have it.

17:12.998 --> 17:14.617
What? You won it; you keep it.

17:14.618 --> 17:17.332
You keep it. It'll be happier here. Look.

17:18.701 --> 17:21.396
See? Surrounded by his little
friends okay. Gotta go.

17:21.397 --> 17:25.467
Oh wait, wait! I can't keep this trophy,
even though it comes past my knee.

17:25.719 --> 17:27.586
I haven't earned it.
It'd be meaningless.

17:27.587 --> 17:29.470
It's more annoying than meaningless.

17:29.471 --> 17:33.120
I could only accept it if
I won it honourably in a rematch.

17:33.731 --> 17:35.219
You mean I'd have to fight you again?

17:35.598 --> 17:37.054
But we already did that.

17:37.337 --> 17:40.147
Okay, how about this. We play foozball?

17:41.372 --> 17:43.771
There is no honour in foosball.

17:44.138 --> 17:47.578
Wrong. Wrong.

17:47.942 --> 17:50.000
Mr. Pool, can we talk?

17:50.001 --> 17:52.470
Oh, of course my little dragon killer, killer.

17:53.083 --> 17:56.500
I thought you should know
I agreed to a rematch with Tai Wai Tse.

17:56.501 --> 17:58.397
That's fantastic, I'm thrilled.

17:58.398 --> 18:00.447
Although all future booking's
should go through me.

18:00.448 --> 18:01.692
It won't happen again.

18:01.693 --> 18:02.977
Now here's the thing.

18:03.915 --> 18:05.118
I need you to train me.

18:05.119 --> 18:07.126
Oh sure, we'll do our usual breathing exercises.

18:07.127 --> 18:09.573
No, I mean really train me.
Like teach me to fight.

18:09.574 --> 18:11.053
But you know how to fight.

18:11.054 --> 18:12.054
I forgot.

18:44.933 --> 18:48.018
I lost my chi! Where's my chi?
Have you seen it?

18:48.019 --> 18:50.233
Sabrina look, it's right there inside you.

18:50.234 --> 18:51.651
Now you've got the stuff.

18:51.652 --> 18:53.724
I don't know what made you lose your confidence

18:53.844 --> 18:55.885
but I suggest you get it back really soon.

18:56.267 --> 18:58.341
Okay you're right.
I just need to focus and concentrate.

18:58.807 --> 19:01.199
Focus and concentrate.
Focus and concentrate.

19:02.020 --> 19:03.043
Oh! Sorry.

19:03.537 --> 19:04.553
Good luck.

19:06.677 --> 19:09.129
There's Tai Wai Tse.
Does he look flabbier to you?

19:09.230 --> 19:10.230
Not really.

19:12.019 --> 19:13.248
Go get him Sabrina.

19:16.533 --> 19:18.202
So Sabrina, we meet again. 

19:18.403 --> 19:20.977
Yeah, hi! Nice shirt.

19:24.794 --> 19:25.824
O:kay!

19:45.765 --> 19:48.582
Okay I guess upper body
isn't my strength, lets go for legs.

19:53.656 --> 19:56.096
Can you come over here?
I have to ask you a question.

19:56.097 --> 19:58.129
No way. It's a trick,
you'll pull me down.

19:58.130 --> 20:02.178
No I won't. I just want to ask if there's
an honourable way to beg for mercy?

20:02.179 --> 20:03.656
It's not time for mercy yet.

20:10.266 --> 20:11.475
How about now?

20:12.962 --> 20:15.032
You approached this match
with honour, Sabrina.

20:15.033 --> 20:17.297
Now close your eye's and
we'll end it that way.

20:22.106 --> 20:23.576
The UNEI trophy's mine.

20:24.815 --> 20:26.275
Sabrina are you okay?

20:26.556 --> 20:29.575
I think I bruised my chi,
but my conscience is clear.

20:30.175 --> 20:32.161
Excuse me, there's something I have to do.

20:34.468 --> 20:38.484
So I guess this is it.
I'm giving you to your rightful owner.

20:38.485 --> 20:39.910
I'm not a cheater anymore.

20:40.194 --> 20:41.202
I know.

20:41.403 --> 20:42.403
Loser!

20:42.404 --> 20:44.439
I'm not going to miss you one bit.

20:47.016 --> 20:48.443
Hey aunt Zelda, look.

20:50.033 --> 20:53.022
Oh you did the right thing. How do you feel?

20:53.023 --> 20:54.447
Sore but good.

20:54.708 --> 20:56.388
Where's aunt Hilda? I wanna tell her the news.

20:56.389 --> 20:59.413
She's at the symphony.
It's her first night playing second chair.

20:59.514 --> 21:01.261
I wish she had beaten that guy.

21:01.262 --> 21:04.120
Me to, but what can you do?

21:22.452 --> 21:24.074
- Can we come it?
- Sure.

21:24.175 --> 21:25.595
We've got something for you.

21:26.196 --> 21:27.421
Is that a trophy?

21:27.909 --> 21:29.166
And it comes up to your ankle.

21:29.167 --> 21:32.197
'world's greatest niece' Oh that's so nice.

21:32.298 --> 21:33.916
Well you earned it.

21:34.017 --> 21:37.655
Fair and square.
Hey! What's that around your neck?

21:37.656 --> 21:38.656
Nothing!

21:39.839 --> 21:41.840
It's a gold medal isn't it?

21:41.841 --> 21:43.304
Where did you get that?

21:43.405 --> 21:45.284
Kerry Strugg gave it to me?

21:46.396 --> 21:47.671
 Homework time!

21:47.672 --> 21:49.418
