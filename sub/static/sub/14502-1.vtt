GEE, YOU LOOK SO FINE.

00:27.510 --> 00:29.740
GEE, YOU SHOULD BE MINE.

00:30.480 --> 00:32.812

00:45.495 --> 00:47.690
YOU SURE LOOK GOOD TO ME.

00:48.198 --> 00:50.257
MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS.

00:51.601 --> 00:53.466
YOU THRILL ME BODACIOUS.

00:54.671 --> 00:56.764
YOU'RE MY ADMIRATION LIKE...

00:56.906 --> 01:00.205
A SWINGING KING
WHEN IT STARTS TO SWING.

01:00.577 --> 01:02.704
GEE, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME?

01:03.480 --> 01:05.209
GEE, I'M IN LOVE...

01:05.348 --> 01:08.511
YOU SEE. GEE, CAN'T WE AGREE?

01:08.651 --> 01:11.814
ON ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR,
YOU AND ME.

02:00.937 --> 02:02.962
GEE, YOU LOOK SO FINE.

02:03.673 --> 02:05.903
GEE, YOU SHOULD BE MINE.

02:06.576 --> 02:08.942
GEE, OH HOW I PINE.

02:09.679 --> 02:12.113
GEE, YOU SURE ARE FINE.

02:12.982 --> 02:15.041
GEE, LIKE CHERRY PIE.

02:15.852 --> 02:18.116
GEE, I HOPE TO DIE.

02:18.888 --> 02:21.118
GEE, AND THAT'S NO LIE.

02:21.591 --> 02:24.219
JACK, YOU SURE LOOK GOOD TO ME.

02:24.661 --> 02:25.184
MY...

02:25.328 --> 02:27.523
GOODNESS GRACIOUS.

02:28.131 --> 02:30.258
YOU THRILL ME BODACIOUS.

02:31.034 --> 02:32.797
YOU'RE MY ADMIRATION...

02:33.069 --> 02:34.627
LIKE A SWINGING KING...

02:34.771 --> 02:36.864
WHEN IT STARTS TO SWING.

02:37.106 --> 02:39.336
GEE WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME?

02:40.109 --> 02:43.374
GEE, I'M IN LOVE, YOU SEE.
GEE...

02:43.513 --> 02:45.071
CAN WE AGREE?

02:45.215 --> 02:48.446
ON ONE, TWO,
THREE, FOUR, YOU AND ME.

03:20.984 --> 03:24.044
Hey, we're all proud of you, Buster.
Charlie.

03:24.520 --> 03:26.988
Small town cops dropping
a pair like this.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.857
Wait a lifetime, never even
sniff one this good.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.655
Wanna make a move to the boroughs,
you let me know.

03:32.795 --> 03:34.023
It's a phone call.

03:34.597 --> 03:36.792
Hey, maybe you
wanna throw the switch.

03:36.933 --> 03:38.025
I can fix that, too.

03:40.570 --> 03:41.969
You are such an asshole.

03:42.205 --> 03:43.729
You don't even know
what you have here.

03:44.941 --> 03:47.933
Whatever it is,
consider it our gift to you.

03:52.849 --> 03:54.339
You know,
you don't have to go in there.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.580
Yeah, I do.

04:06.029 --> 04:08.862
If any two maggots ever deserved
to boil in their own shit,

04:09.565 --> 04:11.499
it was Ray Fernandez
and Martha Beck.

04:13.169 --> 04:13.965
They'd probably still be cozy

04:14.103 --> 04:16.435
in a Lansing jail cell
if it weren't for Buster.

04:17.640 --> 04:21.599
Or, maybe it was Annie.
Buster's wife.

04:23.479 --> 04:26.915
Who one September night stuck
a service thirty-eight in her ear.

04:27.050 --> 04:29.712
No note. No nothin'.

04:31.120 --> 04:33.520
Just blew her brains
out all over the bathtub.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.520
Cops don't talk about what they see.

04:38.895 --> 04:42.490
They push it down with a stiff Bromo
and a bourbon back, hide behind a...

04:42.632 --> 04:46.329
newspaper and hope nobody notices.
But after...

04:46.469 --> 04:49.063
Buster found Annie in the bathroom,
that all changed.

04:50.306 --> 04:53.139
And he took it out on Fernandez
and Beck with a vengeance.

04:59.582 --> 05:01.413
If they wrote
a book on confidence men,

05:01.784 --> 05:03.809
Ray Fernandez would've
been the pinup boy.

05:06.322 --> 05:09.519
He wasn't the first rat-fuck barnacle
to play the Ionely hearts game.

05:09.859 --> 05:15.092
But he might've been the smoothest.
He knew the game, he knew his marks.

05:15.264 --> 05:17.198
He loved the way it made him feel.

05:18.101 --> 05:21.798
Hell, he was so slick, he even convinced
himself he was Don-fucking-Juan.

05:23.373 --> 05:24.670
Oh Bea...

05:24.807 --> 05:28.038
I'm so sorry I'm late.
A thousand apologies.

05:28.177 --> 05:31.078
So sorry I'm late.
The meetings with my lawyers ran over.

05:31.214 --> 05:32.408
I'm so sorry I'm late.

05:32.548 --> 05:34.209
Had a meeting with my lawyers.
It went over.

05:34.350 --> 05:35.817
I nearly missed the plane.

05:36.019 --> 05:36.917
I was in such a hurry I...

05:37.053 --> 05:39.647
left my wallet and my passport.

05:39.789 --> 05:42.223
I left my wallet and my passport.

05:42.392 --> 05:45.691
And I left my passport
and my wallet...

05:45.828 --> 05:48.058
on the counter at the airport.

05:48.865 --> 05:49.422
You're even more...

05:49.565 --> 05:51.055
beautiful than your picture.

05:52.568 --> 05:53.830
Stunning.

05:54.871 --> 05:56.338
Today's a special day.

06:01.978 --> 06:03.343
It's the oldest con in the book.

06:04.080 --> 06:08.915
He pen paled 'em, war widows,
old maids, spinsters, anyone alone.

06:09.318 --> 06:10.717
Was like picking plums.

06:11.254 --> 06:14.451
They advertised, for Christ sake,
through correspondence clubs

06:14.590 --> 06:15.989
and Ionely hearts rags.

06:16.559 --> 06:17.890
He was quite the bard.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.755
Always slipping in a little
fishing expedition to feel...

06:20.897 --> 06:25.994
out their bank account.
If he smelled... money, Valentino.

06:26.202 --> 06:27.499
If he thought they were broke...

06:28.671 --> 06:30.571
he'd bounce 'em...
like a bad check.

06:39.582 --> 06:41.015
Buster was my partner.

06:41.751 --> 06:44.276
We went all the way back to a squad car,
for Christ sake.

06:45.555 --> 06:47.420
He was the toughest badge
I'd ever seen.

06:48.024 --> 06:50.322
Turned more collars than
a Chinaman drycleaner.

06:51.060 --> 06:54.723
But after he lost Annie,
he parked himself behind the desk,

06:54.964 --> 06:59.560
pushing paper, taking phone calls,
and a lot of other people's shit.

07:00.269 --> 07:01.827
I didn't understand that.

07:02.972 --> 07:04.030
Robinson, Homicide.

07:04.173 --> 07:05.231
You don't know shit
because Jackie Robinson is a...

07:05.374 --> 07:07.672
I don't know shit?
Veteran baseball...

07:07.810 --> 07:08.708
Fuck Jackie Robinson.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.608
Jesus Christ, let me tell you
something so everybody can hear me.

07:10.746 --> 07:11.838
You gave me a hundred to one.

07:11.981 --> 07:12.948
Hundred to one I wouldn't drop

07:13.082 --> 07:14.777
a nickel on the first team
to put a nigger in baseball.

07:14.917 --> 07:17.613
Okay? Even, even if he
is a cousin of Robinson's here.

07:17.753 --> 07:18.913
Okay?

07:19.255 --> 07:20.244
It's okay.

07:20.389 --> 07:21.913
Hello. Oh, Mrs. Reilly?

07:22.058 --> 07:23.992
Oh, Reilly,
your wife's on the phone.

07:24.327 --> 07:25.316
Her negro lover just left,

07:25.461 --> 07:27.326
wants to know if I can
come down there and finish her off.

07:27.463 --> 07:28.157
How you gonna...
finish her off,

07:28.297 --> 07:30.288
you haven't seen your prick
in six months, you fat fuck.

07:30.433 --> 07:31.798
That's funny, your wife...
found it real good.

07:31.934 --> 07:33.629
You think I'm scared of you...
you big fuckin' sack of meat?

07:33.769 --> 07:34.633
- Get outta here.
- Why don't ya...

07:34.770 --> 07:35.930
keep your mouth shut
and learn something?

07:36.072 --> 07:37.061
Fuck you.

07:37.206 --> 07:39.436
I'm telling you, he's gonna
burn your house... down one day.

07:39.575 --> 07:40.667
He's a rat.

07:41.777 --> 07:43.210
Listen, me and Eastman,
we're going over to Jimmy's.

07:43.346 --> 07:46.509
We're gonna uh, play some cards,
suck on the beer tit, tell some lies.

07:46.649 --> 07:47.673
How 'bout it?

07:47.984 --> 07:49.008
Hey Robbie.

07:49.152 --> 07:50.210
Hey Rene.

07:51.988 --> 07:53.853
I can't.
I... gotta take the train tonight.

07:54.524 --> 07:55.957
Train?
What happened to your car?

07:56.092 --> 07:57.081
What, you didn't hear?

07:57.260 --> 07:58.989
The kid drove
it into some garbage cans.

07:59.162 --> 08:00.754
Siren going, lights, everything.

08:00.897 --> 08:01.727
Which bone did you break?

08:01.864 --> 08:03.024
The one between his ears.

08:03.199 --> 08:04.063
Hey, I can drop you.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.225
Yeah, Rene could give you...
a lift.

08:08.337 --> 08:09.167
Nice.

08:09.305 --> 08:09.862
Okay.

08:10.006 --> 08:10.802
Enough.

08:10.940 --> 08:11.838
What?

08:11.974 --> 08:13.168
So we...
playing cards or what?

08:13.309 --> 08:14.742
No, but I'II...
take that ride.

08:15.011 --> 08:16.205
Meet ya at Jimmy's.

08:21.250 --> 08:22.342
By the time Fernandez picked up

08:22.485 --> 08:25.818
on Martha Beck's bullshit smear
in some Ionely hearts rag...

08:26.222 --> 08:27.712
she'd already
been picked over by every...

08:27.857 --> 08:31.384
Tom-Dick son of a bitch who ever
sniffed a skirt, including her own...

08:31.527 --> 08:35.293
brother, who started raping her from...
the time she was ten.

08:36.566 --> 08:37.897
She was good-Iooking, alright.

08:38.634 --> 08:40.033
But damaged goods.

08:42.004 --> 08:43.062
Martha.

08:43.639 --> 08:45.163
Raymond.

08:46.576 --> 08:48.669
Uh, uh, I'm sorry I'm late.

08:48.844 --> 08:51.608
The meetings with my uh,
lawyers ran over.

08:52.014 --> 08:53.606
I was in such a hurry I...

08:54.050 --> 08:55.017
I nearly missed my plane

08:55.151 --> 08:58.086
and I left my wallet
and passport at the counter.

08:58.654 --> 09:00.189
What kind of lawyers?

09:00.189 --> 09:05.058
Oh... just, u- regular lawyers.

09:05.861 --> 09:10.059
We're closing in on some uh,
some import prospects.

09:14.904 --> 09:19.034
I can't believe you're here.
I can't believe we're here.

09:19.208 --> 09:23.042
I mean af- after so many letters...
and for such a long time, it's...

09:24.547 --> 09:25.878
It's incredible.

09:26.015 --> 09:28.609
I mean, here we are...
face to face.

09:30.119 --> 09:30.608
Oh, what?

09:30.753 --> 09:32.243
Please say something.

09:32.388 --> 09:33.548
I uh...

09:36.292 --> 09:37.987
You're just so beautiful.

09:39.195 --> 09:41.356
May I... show you to a table?

09:41.597 --> 09:43.064
How's room service?

09:43.165 --> 09:44.757
It's off the menu, ma'am.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.398
We'll have... breakfast in bed.

09:53.242 --> 09:54.266
What are you doing?

09:54.543 --> 09:56.602
I have an appointment.
I won't be an hour.

09:58.948 --> 10:00.643
I love the way you write.

10:00.916 --> 10:02.076
Such a poet.

10:03.719 --> 10:05.050
Raymond?

10:05.788 --> 10:07.619
You don't disappoint.

10:07.790 --> 10:10.020
A regular Charles Boyer.

10:16.699 --> 10:17.859
Hey, what d'you say we...

10:18.000 --> 10:20.992
test our luck later,
watch the greyhounds run?

10:21.971 --> 10:23.404
Think you can wait... for me?

10:23.572 --> 10:24.869
Oh, I can wait.

10:25.574 --> 10:27.633
The question is, can you?

10:34.984 --> 10:36.952
Hey, you're a little kitty cat.

10:43.192 --> 10:44.159
Toodle-Ioo.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.058
Toodle-Ioo.

10:53.169 --> 10:55.103
Maybe he skinned out
'cause she was broke.

10:55.237 --> 10:57.535
Or maybe he was afraid
she was a keeper.

10:58.074 --> 11:01.532
Either way, Martha had him...
figured at Hello.

11:06.082 --> 11:09.449
Thou anointest my head with oil,
my cup runneth over.

11:09.852 --> 11:13.686
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life.

11:13.856 --> 11:17.656
And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord... forever. Amen.

11:31.307 --> 11:32.535
Dorothy.

11:32.975 --> 11:35.341
My deepest sympathies.

11:35.478 --> 11:36.775
Well thank you.

11:37.780 --> 11:38.747
I'm sorry. Raymond...

11:38.881 --> 11:41.748
Martin.
I was a customer of your husband's.

11:41.884 --> 11:44.409
He was a tough...
but honest businessman.

11:44.553 --> 11:47.750
And I know he'll be missed,
that son of a gun.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.185
What company...
you with?

11:49.325 --> 11:52.817
Bradley Coachworks in Cleveland.
I manage receivables.

11:52.962 --> 11:55.123
So you know our...
account man, Ben Chadwick.

11:55.431 --> 11:58.332
Of course.
Ben, he's a good man.

11:58.467 --> 11:59.832
Anybody who knew
my father knew he was...

11:59.969 --> 12:01.027
a son of a bitch.

12:01.170 --> 12:03.195
And Ben Chadwick's
been dead five years.

12:07.443 --> 12:08.671
Oh my... god!

12:09.779 --> 12:11.770
Oh my god!

12:14.250 --> 12:18.186
My husband's company has been
a loyal customer for many years.

12:18.487 --> 12:21.285
In spite of your...
disregard for the deceased,

12:21.824 --> 12:23.621
he did a fair business with us.

12:24.660 --> 12:29.654
And it's disgraceful
that you'd humiliate a...

12:29.799 --> 12:31.460
patron on this, of all days.

12:31.734 --> 12:35.727
Shame on you!
Shame on you.

12:36.806 --> 12:39.331
Let's go, baby.
Let's go, baby.

12:39.475 --> 12:41.067
Shame on you!

12:42.178 --> 12:44.442
Come on.
Are you okay?

12:44.580 --> 12:45.945
I'm okay.

12:48.584 --> 12:50.814
It's hard to say whose...
voodoo was working on who.

12:52.288 --> 12:54.085
But the day them
two figured each other out

12:54.824 --> 12:57.418
was the beginning of
a bad end for a lot of people.

13:01.130 --> 13:02.188
So what's up with Rene?

13:02.331 --> 13:03.696
You don't need to know.

13:03.866 --> 13:06.960
What, she's got those uh,
silver dollar summits.

13:07.069 --> 13:08.195
Am I right?

13:09.104 --> 13:11.595
Come on.
A week's pay for confirmation.

13:11.740 --> 13:13.037
You don't make enough, Charlie.

13:13.175 --> 13:13.903
Well that's true.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.010
- Slow down here.
- Leave it alone.

13:15.144 --> 13:16.202
- Slow down. Slow down.
- Leave it alone.

13:16.345 --> 13:17.505
No-no, come on, stop.

13:17.646 --> 13:18.408
Come on.

13:18.547 --> 13:19.741
Stop.

13:23.786 --> 13:24.480
What're you doing?

13:24.620 --> 13:26.315
- Borrowing money?
- Shut... the fuck up.

13:26.455 --> 13:27.444
What're you doing?

13:29.792 --> 13:31.817
Back up! Back up, now!

13:32.361 --> 13:33.828
Back up, shit stick.

13:37.600 --> 13:38.965
We gotta get him to County.

13:39.168 --> 13:41.033
You're not putting...
that bloody mess in my car.

13:41.470 --> 13:42.698
Let's go.

13:46.408 --> 13:46.965
What?

13:47.109 --> 13:49.976
Look. Look at my car.
It's full of blood.

13:50.779 --> 13:52.406
Next time you take the train.

13:52.548 --> 13:53.515
I'm sorry.

13:53.649 --> 13:54.274
Oh.

13:54.416 --> 13:55.007
I'll pay for it.

13:55.150 --> 13:56.310
My ass.

13:57.353 --> 13:59.378
What're you trying to do anyway,
get yourself killed?

13:59.788 --> 14:06.057
Baker Baker.
Baker Baker, you up?

14:07.796 --> 14:08.990
Two Baker Baker.

14:09.131 --> 14:11.793
Deceased female in Wantaugh,
twenty-seven thirty-two Merrick Road.

14:11.934 --> 14:12.992
Possible suicide.

14:13.135 --> 14:14.432
Uh, we're ten-ten.

14:14.537 --> 14:16.698
Detective Reilly
requested you, sir.

14:17.306 --> 14:19.365
I've been babysitting this
fuckin' midget for a year, now.

14:19.508 --> 14:20.770
Let's just go.

14:21.343 --> 14:22.275
- With you?
- Yeah.

14:22.411 --> 14:24.402
- Nah.
- No-no, let's just do it.

14:24.780 --> 14:25.872
Come on.

14:29.885 --> 14:31.375
Two Baker Baker en route.

14:35.090 --> 14:36.387
It's raining out there.

14:37.359 --> 14:39.224
You know if she had
any family or relatives?

14:39.662 --> 14:41.596
I, you know, I don't... know.

14:41.730 --> 14:42.856
What's the story?

14:42.965 --> 14:44.262
We're supposed to be off duty.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.966
Well the book says uh,
two detectives from Homicide.

14:47.269 --> 14:48.463
What're you... doing here?

14:48.604 --> 14:50.697
Me? I was losing.

14:51.240 --> 14:52.468
Suspicious.

14:53.342 --> 14:54.707
You are such a piece of shit.

14:55.110 --> 14:56.839
That's not really the point,
is it?

15:13.162 --> 15:15.858
Patty Forsythe, twenty-five.

15:16.231 --> 15:19.564
Filleted the radial,
couple superficials.

15:19.702 --> 15:22.899
Had a hard time getting started
but eventually got it right.

15:23.505 --> 15:24.335
Good, all we need is...

15:24.473 --> 15:26.498
some celery sticks and we can
have a couple Bloody Marys.

15:26.875 --> 15:28.274
Why is this suspicious?

15:28.777 --> 15:30.210
Why is it suspicious?

15:30.346 --> 15:33.509
Well, look, tasty... dame.
Right? She got a nice place.

15:33.649 --> 15:34.206
She got a job.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.942
What, out of the blue
she just decides to play...

15:36.085 --> 15:37.177
connect the dots with a razor?

15:37.319 --> 15:37.944
Come on.

15:38.087 --> 15:39.918
All right, everybody out.

15:40.055 --> 15:40.646
Let's go.

15:40.789 --> 15:43.257
I want names and badges.
Everyone.

15:43.892 --> 15:44.688
Come... on.

15:44.827 --> 15:47.387
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- Huh?

15:47.563 --> 15:48.325
What do you mean
what's wrong with me?

15:48.464 --> 15:49.590
It's a suicide.

15:49.732 --> 15:51.063
A minute ago you said
it was suspicious.

15:51.200 --> 15:51.666
Which is it?

15:51.800 --> 15:54.530
It's a suspicious suicide.
How's that?

15:57.506 --> 16:00.066
I make her a snow cone uh,
thirty-six to forty-eight.

16:00.209 --> 16:00.766
Mm-hm.

16:00.909 --> 16:02.968
She used ice.
Probably thought it would hurt.

16:03.112 --> 16:04.306
Yeah... probably did.

16:04.647 --> 16:07.707
Vascular contractions would
explain the false starts.

16:07.883 --> 16:09.680
Alright, give me a liver...
temp on her.

16:09.885 --> 16:12.683
So, since...
when is he back on the job?

16:13.222 --> 16:14.086
He's always been on the job.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.190
- Oh. Really?
- Mm.

16:15.324 --> 16:17.849
See that, all this time I'm thinking
he works for the fuckin' phone company.

16:18.394 --> 16:19.452
You called us, remember?

16:19.595 --> 16:20.994
- Mm-hm.
- He's top dick.

16:21.130 --> 16:22.825
Yeah, he is.
You got that right.

16:23.499 --> 16:24.488
Why don't you
keep your mouth shut.

16:24.633 --> 16:25.657
Why?
What, is he gonna do something?

16:25.801 --> 16:26.631
He's not gonna do anything.

16:26.769 --> 16:28.430
You know why?
'Cause he's a fucking pug.

16:30.472 --> 16:31.598
Keep it up.

16:32.474 --> 16:34.271
Donuts for the note.
Reilly's buying.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.604
There's no note.

16:35.744 --> 16:36.938
There is a note.

16:37.513 --> 16:39.208
She wanted
to get somebody's attention.

16:39.381 --> 16:40.871
You'd know all about that,
wouldn't you?

16:41.316 --> 16:42.078
Hey.

16:42.217 --> 16:43.479
Hey-hey. I can't...

16:43.619 --> 16:44.643
You bite...
your fuckin' tongue out, you...

16:44.787 --> 16:45.776
Hey. Hear me?

16:45.921 --> 16:47.183
Huh?

16:47.456 --> 16:48.946
I can't...

16:56.799 --> 16:57.925
Found it.

16:59.068 --> 17:00.399
Eclair for me, shit stick.

17:00.536 --> 17:01.833
Fuck you.

17:22.523 --> 17:23.923
Hey.

17:36.672 --> 17:38.105
Don't forget my father.

17:54.356 --> 17:56.085
So your sister's got Eddie?

17:59.828 --> 18:02.319
Yeah, but I still gotta go.

18:02.765 --> 18:04.494
It's two in the morning.

18:04.666 --> 18:08.602
Yup. I gotta go.

18:12.307 --> 18:13.569
Where are my pants?

18:13.709 --> 18:14.971
Over here.

18:17.579 --> 18:19.740
How long you gonna
keep me a secret, huh?

18:20.749 --> 18:22.478
You're no secret.
Trust me.

18:24.887 --> 18:26.354
Shoes?

18:26.488 --> 18:28.080
They're down over there.

18:29.291 --> 18:31.282
Oh yeah. I heard the Dispatch.
You okay?

18:31.426 --> 18:32.654
Yeah.

18:32.961 --> 18:36.488
I mean come on, that's my job.
Been doing it a long time.

18:37.466 --> 18:39.400
That doesn't
mean you're not human.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.602
I don't wanna talk about it.

18:42.971 --> 18:44.598
Hey, I'm... not your wife.

18:45.541 --> 18:47.133
So don't treat me like one.

18:50.879 --> 18:52.039
I'm sorry.

18:55.083 --> 19:01.249
You know Eddie, he never cried.
Not even at the funeral.

19:01.423 --> 19:02.117
No?

19:02.257 --> 19:03.349
No.

19:04.660 --> 19:06.787
Kid shouldn't
have to be that tough.

19:07.496 --> 19:08.724
Neither should you.

19:13.902 --> 19:15.494
Make you some eggs?

19:16.305 --> 19:19.433
You're a doll.
But I gotta go.

19:23.045 --> 19:24.376
Bye. See you later.

19:24.613 --> 19:26.046
Okay. Wanna take my car?

19:26.248 --> 19:30.412
Nah. I'll just walk down to Merrick...
take the bus.

19:31.186 --> 19:32.380
It'll be easier.

19:33.155 --> 19:34.144
Okay.

19:48.537 --> 19:49.902
How'd you find me?

19:50.973 --> 19:52.531
I'm a detective, remember?

19:52.741 --> 19:55.801
Well, I thought
maybe you was a peeping Tom.

19:58.180 --> 20:02.913
You know uh,
no one's gonna hold her against you.

20:03.652 --> 20:05.620
Yeah, except for maybe my son.

20:08.891 --> 20:11.121
Two fights in one night.
That's pretty good.

20:12.628 --> 20:13.788
And Reilly.

20:14.730 --> 20:18.166
Reilly's a... fuckin' idiot.
You used to know that.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.858
I don't know, Charlie.

20:21.336 --> 20:23.770
People don't just punch out
for no reason.

20:24.773 --> 20:28.334
Yeah well, she had a reason.

20:30.979 --> 20:33.447
Uh, I was talking about Annie.

20:34.983 --> 20:36.075
Yeah, I know.

20:39.321 --> 20:42.347
All right, so our girl, she comes
home early with the groceries.

20:42.691 --> 20:44.158
She's looking
for a little romance.

20:44.293 --> 20:49.287
She's got uh, candles,
bottle of chianti, and some rib eyes.

20:49.798 --> 20:53.598
She sees the boyfriend through
the back door with his sister

20:53.735 --> 20:56.636
bent over the table, here,
doing a donkey.

20:57.439 --> 20:58.531
A sister?

20:58.740 --> 20:59.604
Yeah, sister.

20:59.741 --> 21:00.503
Bent over...

21:00.642 --> 21:02.769
Seen them through the back...
door on this table.

21:03.045 --> 21:04.535
People are work.
What can I tell ya?

21:04.680 --> 21:05.942
Jesus Christ.

21:06.081 --> 21:10.711
All right, so, she leaves,
comes back after they're gone.

21:10.852 --> 21:15.346
She scrubs the table with Brillo.
Goes into the bathroom.

21:16.458 --> 21:17.254
You know the rest.

21:17.392 --> 21:18.620
Did they dust?

21:19.194 --> 21:20.161
No.

21:20.362 --> 21:21.420
Why not?

21:21.730 --> 21:22.526
Because while fucking around

21:22.664 --> 21:24.825
on your girlfriend may be shitty,
it ain't illegal.

21:25.133 --> 21:26.464
At least not yet, anyway.

21:26.735 --> 21:28.362
Well it... is,
if it's your sister.

21:30.138 --> 21:34.871
She had to have cash or...
jewelry or silverware or something.

21:35.010 --> 21:36.671
Yeah, she had the ruby
slippers and the diamond broche

21:36.812 --> 21:38.780
she wears to the
steno pool every day.

21:39.414 --> 21:40.972
She worked for the L-I double-R,
for Christ sakes.

21:41.116 --> 21:42.481
She's got nothing.

21:43.752 --> 21:45.083
Let me stake you a...
roll of quarters,

21:45.220 --> 21:46.881
we can still shine them
freebooters down at Jimmy's.

21:47.022 --> 21:47.579
Come on.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.850
Nah. I gotta go home.

21:50.125 --> 21:51.114
Yeah.

22:13.448 --> 22:14.506
Where you been?

22:15.851 --> 22:16.647
Huh?

22:16.785 --> 22:18.047
You first.

22:19.788 --> 22:22.655
Where you been?
You been out drinking? Huh?

22:22.791 --> 22:23.621
- Buster.
- Let me smell your breath.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.624
- Buster, don't. Buster, don't.
- Did you really do that?

22:25.761 --> 22:26.955
- Stop it.
- Let me smell your breath.

22:27.095 --> 22:28.062
- Stop. Buster, stop.
- This is...

22:28.196 --> 22:29.288
- Stop it. Stop it.
- Stay out of it, Ida.

22:29.431 --> 22:30.125
Stop.

22:30.265 --> 22:32.256
- So... What're you doing!
- What's wrong with you?

22:32.401 --> 22:33.095
What's wrong with you?

22:33.235 --> 22:35.760
I'm trying to keep you from making
an ass out of yourself.

22:35.904 --> 22:39.499
Ida, he wrecked the car a week ago.
He shouldn't even been driving.

22:39.641 --> 22:42.610
He's been delivering papers
so he could pay to fix the car.

22:42.744 --> 22:44.473
He wanted to surprise you.

22:46.715 --> 22:49.013
Yeah, well, how the hell
was I supposed to know?

22:49.184 --> 22:51.516
I don't know, you tell me,
you're the cop.

22:52.754 --> 22:55.484
Eddie. Eddie.

22:56.558 --> 22:58.048
I'M IN TOWN.

22:58.460 --> 23:01.054
CAN'T YOU HEAR ME HONEY,
I'M IN TOWN.

23:02.330 --> 23:06.323
HANGIN' ROUN',
JUST WAITIN' FOR YOU.

23:08.203 --> 23:12.765
CAN'T YOU SEE, YOU'RE THE ONE
AND ONLY BO Y FOR ME.

23:13.608 --> 23:18.045
MM, YOU AND ME ARE.
UNINTELLIGIBLE.

23:18.647 --> 23:23.846
Sweetest Delphine, your letter
of last week gives me such hope.

23:24.052 --> 23:26.282
The way you speak
of your daughter gives me

23:26.421 --> 23:30.619
a sense that there is love
in this world left for me.

23:31.193 --> 23:33.491
No-no-no-no, too soft,
too soft.

23:33.628 --> 23:35.186
And mention the kid's name,
mothers love that stuff.

23:35.330 --> 23:36.922
It's the simple things.

23:37.165 --> 23:41.033
I will arrive on March tenth
with my sister Martha.

23:41.169 --> 23:42.101
Excellent.

23:42.237 --> 23:44.330
She's the hottest
bitch you've ever seen,

23:44.473 --> 23:46.441
and does me like a kitten.

23:46.741 --> 23:48.140
That's for sure.

23:48.577 --> 23:49.874
Mm.

23:50.011 --> 23:51.308
You smell like a pimp.

23:51.446 --> 23:53.880
That's the only way I can
get your scent off me, Kitty Cat.

23:54.082 --> 23:56.209
Okay, okay, sign this.

23:57.052 --> 24:01.045
Yeah. Ray Martin.

24:07.129 --> 24:08.687
Hey, hold on.

24:09.297 --> 24:10.389
What?

24:10.565 --> 24:11.793
Go get dressed.

24:11.967 --> 24:13.161
What for?

24:14.236 --> 24:16.101
Because I want you with me.

24:16.471 --> 24:19.201
Really? Why?

24:20.742 --> 24:22.209
Make sure I behave.

24:22.944 --> 24:26.846
Besides,
I like it when you watch me work.

24:30.185 --> 24:31.914
So feisty.

24:36.791 --> 24:38.725
I've been trying to get your
ass street side for a year,

24:38.860 --> 24:39.792
and you wanna chase this?

24:39.928 --> 24:40.986
Yeah I do.

24:41.163 --> 24:42.391
If it'd make you feel better,

24:42.531 --> 24:44.658
I'll put a car on the house,
maybe they'II... come back.

24:44.799 --> 24:45.857
They're not coming back.

24:46.001 --> 24:47.798
Look Buster, you wanna get your ass

24:47.936 --> 24:49.904
off the desk and get
back to work, that's great.

24:50.038 --> 24:52.336
This thing,
it's just a heart break.

24:52.474 --> 24:54.271
Robbie,
Motor Pool sent up your keys.

24:54.409 --> 24:55.501
Say your car's as good as new.

24:55.644 --> 24:56.838
Thanks.

25:03.752 --> 25:07.415
Look, a girl don't rip herself up
like that for no reason.

25:07.556 --> 25:11.356
With all due respect to your wife,
this case isn't fucking about her.

25:14.362 --> 25:15.954
Let me tell you something, Mac.

25:16.097 --> 25:18.793
You couldn't find a rattlesnake
in a fucking lunch bag.

25:19.234 --> 25:21.259
This is a Ionely
hearts a mile away.

25:21.436 --> 25:23.904
Get outta my way,
I'll make you look like a genius.

25:23.972 --> 25:26.236
And don't ever mention
my wife again.

25:26.374 --> 25:28.239
It's none
of your fucking business!

25:31.646 --> 25:33.079
Fuckin' asshole.

25:37.085 --> 25:39.485
Wounds are consistent
with self-infliction.

25:40.388 --> 25:41.980
So, didn't we know that...
already?

25:42.591 --> 25:43.819
She pregnant?

25:45.427 --> 25:46.894
Very good, Detective.

25:47.028 --> 25:48.723
Oh, Jesus Christ.

25:49.564 --> 25:50.622
Think she knew?

25:50.799 --> 25:51.993
Can't help you there.

25:52.234 --> 25:54.293
Sure she did.
That was the hook.

25:54.636 --> 25:56.501
She thought they were...
gonna be a family.

25:56.805 --> 25:58.204
That's why she did it.

26:00.942 --> 26:02.341
What're you gonna
do with her body?

26:02.544 --> 26:03.704
No kin.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.708
Probably send
it to the medical college.

26:05.847 --> 26:07.815
They're always looking
for cadavers.

26:08.516 --> 26:10.541
Call the Weiss Brothers
in Massapequa.

26:10.752 --> 26:14.244
Tell 'em I'll take care of it.
They know me there.

26:21.496 --> 26:22.520
You know that girl in there?

26:22.664 --> 26:23.255
No.

26:23.398 --> 26:24.365
Why you paying
for her funeral?

26:24.499 --> 26:26.023
Well, you know, medical schools,
they saw 'em up.

26:26.167 --> 26:27.225
You wanna see her sawed up?

26:27.669 --> 26:29.068
Tell you the truth,
I don't give a shit.

26:29.204 --> 26:30.034
Well you know,
maybe you should.

26:30.171 --> 26:32.605
You got three daughters, right?
Think about it.

26:32.741 --> 26:35.539
You dropping a month of paychecks
on a box ain't gonna change nothin'.

26:35.677 --> 26:38.737
It's my paychecks.
Mine. Come on.

26:38.880 --> 26:42.145
Hey, you okay?

26:42.584 --> 26:44.074
I'm fine.

26:44.386 --> 26:45.648
Really?

26:45.820 --> 26:48.584
Really. Let's go.

26:54.863 --> 26:56.922
Remember what you told me
when I made detective?

26:57.465 --> 26:59.490
Huh? You said, do the job.
Make sure you go home.

26:59.634 --> 27:02.501
Don't tell your wife nothing,
and keep the blood out here.

27:02.837 --> 27:05.328
What do you think, you actually make...
a fucking difference out here?

27:06.107 --> 27:07.301
I was kind of hoping we did.

27:07.442 --> 27:09.774
We didn't make this fucking...
sewer, we just work in it.

27:10.412 --> 27:11.936
You taken a good look
at these people?

27:12.080 --> 27:12.569
Huh?

27:12.714 --> 27:14.511
They're fucking animals,
what they do to each other.

27:14.883 --> 27:16.441
You're not gonna change that.

27:16.885 --> 27:19.115
You know,
all I got is the job. Okay?

27:19.254 --> 27:21.688
That's a straight line.
I know that.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.420
Uh, okay, you wanna do this,

27:25.694 --> 27:28.390
this makes some kind
of sense to you, fine.

27:28.997 --> 27:31.329
I'll back you up.
I owe you that.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.391
But for both our sakes,
don't make it personal.

27:34.536 --> 27:38.597
Do it right.
Act like a cop.

27:45.714 --> 27:48.774
Ain't nothing out here
but bad road and trouble.

27:50.185 --> 27:51.618
It's beautiful.

27:51.786 --> 27:56.951
The woods... the silence.
No people.

27:57.459 --> 27:59.324
People die in the damn woods.

28:01.229 --> 28:03.595
And bears fuck there.

28:04.332 --> 28:07.529
By the time Fernandez and Beck
left Patty Forsythe in the bathtub...

28:07.669 --> 28:10.763
they'd already conned a dozen
Janes from Staten Island to Miami Beach.

28:11.906 --> 28:14.807
Martha played the part
of Ray's spinster sister to a T.

28:15.377 --> 28:17.777
Who's the
best you've ever had, hm?

28:17.912 --> 28:18.879
Some sister.

28:24.919 --> 28:27.820
Oh, shit! Shit, shit.
Martha, Martha stop.

28:27.956 --> 28:30.356
It's the cop- it's the cops,
god damn it!

28:30.492 --> 28:31.516
Stop.

28:32.560 --> 28:35.427
Oh god! Oh god!

28:38.967 --> 28:41.868
Oh, okay. Okay.
Okay, okay stop it.

28:42.003 --> 28:44.733
Come here.
Come here. Come on.

28:55.417 --> 28:57.977
Uh... shit. Shit.

28:59.287 --> 29:00.914
License and registration.

29:01.055 --> 29:03.319
I wasn't speeding.
Was I speeding?

29:03.458 --> 29:05.221
You were all
over the place, Mister.

29:15.870 --> 29:16.666
What the hell are you... doing?

29:16.805 --> 29:18.500
Schooling you
a little, Raymond.

29:18.807 --> 29:22.038
The car is stolen, Martha.

29:22.177 --> 29:25.772
I changed the plates, but if
he checks the registration, Jesus!

29:25.914 --> 29:27.313
I'II... take care of it.

29:28.116 --> 29:29.708
What're you gonna do?

29:31.052 --> 29:32.679
Explain it to him.

29:33.621 --> 29:35.555
Wait. Wait. Stop.

29:35.690 --> 29:36.884
See what you did?

29:40.895 --> 29:42.726
Oh, my god.

29:43.264 --> 29:46.324
Martha. Martha.

30:12.193 --> 30:13.217
God.

30:19.434 --> 30:20.924
Okay.

30:34.315 --> 30:35.509
Nice.

30:47.896 --> 30:49.454
Drive carefully.

30:51.199 --> 30:52.496
Thanks.

30:57.105 --> 30:58.538
Now...

31:02.043 --> 31:04.876
who's the best you've ever had, hm?

31:07.081 --> 31:08.241
You are.

31:08.383 --> 31:10.510
Best that peach
fuzz ever had, too.

31:10.652 --> 31:12.586
He shot off like a cap gun.

31:13.988 --> 31:17.287
Don't ever forget who...
butters your bread, Raymond.

31:17.959 --> 31:21.395
Don't you ever love them.

31:22.997 --> 31:24.225
Who?

31:24.532 --> 31:26.056
Any of them.

31:26.267 --> 31:28.132
Don't even pretend.

31:29.003 --> 31:30.595
Understood?

31:32.373 --> 31:33.931
Yeah.

31:35.476 --> 31:36.773
Let's go.

31:40.214 --> 31:41.442
It's hot.

31:50.959 --> 31:52.927
My god...
why would she do that?

31:53.962 --> 31:55.759
I was hoping that you'd tell me.

31:57.332 --> 31:58.731
She have any family?

31:59.734 --> 32:02.703
Um, she lost a husband in the war.

32:02.870 --> 32:04.667
What about...
this Raymond guy?

32:04.839 --> 32:06.204
Ray Martin?

32:06.808 --> 32:07.604
Ray Martin.

32:07.742 --> 32:11.007
Run it.
How'd they meet?

32:11.279 --> 32:13.076
Why don't you...
just ask him?

32:13.448 --> 32:15.279
You got a number?
Address?

32:15.416 --> 32:17.145
Oh my god, he doesn't know?

32:17.885 --> 32:20.376
He's from Florida.
I mean that- that's all I know.

32:20.722 --> 32:23.452
What was he like?
Is he a... good guy? Bad guy?

32:23.591 --> 32:24.148
Raymond?

32:24.292 --> 32:25.190
Yeah.

32:25.326 --> 32:26.850
He's a sweetheart.

32:26.995 --> 32:32.194
He's so... uh, handsome, you know.
He writes her letters and whatnot.

32:32.900 --> 32:34.128
Poems, even.

32:34.302 --> 32:34.927
Poems.

32:35.069 --> 32:37.697
He uh...
never lets you pay for anything.

32:38.373 --> 32:39.704
Loves to go dancing.

32:41.476 --> 32:44.809
He took us all out
to the Rivoli Ballroom one time.

32:46.180 --> 32:47.408
He can really cut it up.

32:48.249 --> 32:52.049
Where'd you learn to dance like this?
You should be in shows or something.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.120
Me and
Arthur Murray go way back.

32:54.255 --> 32:55.517
The real Arthur Murray?

32:55.657 --> 32:58.626
Sure. When we get back from
Florida you can ask him all about it.

32:58.860 --> 33:00.851
Tell me about Florida again, Ray.

33:00.995 --> 33:03.589
Can't be out of
this damn cold soon enough.

33:03.731 --> 33:06.165
Tomorrow, sweetie,
on our drive down to the city,

33:06.300 --> 33:08.791
I'll tell you about it as
many times as you want.

33:14.442 --> 33:17.343
In the meantime,
I'm gonna fill up these glasses.

33:17.478 --> 33:20.038
I can't stand
to see beauty go wanting.

33:27.789 --> 33:30.223
Ray said you got
separated during the war.

33:30.958 --> 33:35.258
Oh yeah. My mother took me
to Spain to her hometown,

33:35.396 --> 33:37.023
when I was just a little girl.

33:37.298 --> 33:39.732
Then the war came
and we couldn't get out.

33:39.934 --> 33:41.424
What happened to Ray?

33:42.770 --> 33:44.533
He didn't tell you?

33:44.639 --> 33:45.697
What?

33:46.507 --> 33:48.270
Don't tell him I told you,

33:48.776 --> 33:51.472
but he worked for
the British Intelligence.

33:51.612 --> 33:53.375
He fought fascists.

33:54.215 --> 33:55.807
Like a secret agent?

33:57.085 --> 33:58.814
You didn't hear it from me.

34:01.022 --> 34:02.853
I tell you something, Martha.

34:02.990 --> 34:06.118
Spy or no spy, that brother

34:06.260 --> 34:09.752
of yours makes me feel
positively adolescent.

34:09.964 --> 34:12.125
Oh honey, you've got
something on your teeth.

35:48.196 --> 35:49.424
Let me ask you something.

35:49.931 --> 35:52.365
What in the
fuck are we doing back here?

35:53.034 --> 35:53.898
He's got a hunch.

35:54.035 --> 35:57.004
He's got a hunch.
And this is uh, for what?

35:58.506 --> 36:01.634
Extractions.
Need a confession, you pull a tooth.

36:03.477 --> 36:05.001
Oh, okay.

36:05.446 --> 36:06.879
Oh Christ, what's that stink?

36:07.014 --> 36:08.311
Fucking rat.

36:10.751 --> 36:12.776
This is a snipe hunt.
You know that, right?

36:12.920 --> 36:14.615
Cupids Crossroads.

36:14.755 --> 36:17.519
The club for Ionely
heart connections.

36:18.059 --> 36:20.789
Have you ever passed someone
on a corner and wondered,

36:20.928 --> 36:23.294
could that
be my immortal Capulet?

36:23.898 --> 36:27.334
My irr- irr- irrevocable Montague?

36:27.468 --> 36:30.028
At Cupids Crossroads,
no one escapes...

36:30.238 --> 36:31.762
the raptures of love.

36:32.273 --> 36:33.934
How 'bout
this Dream Catcher?

36:35.343 --> 36:36.105
Mature female...

36:36.244 --> 36:39.680
Ioves nightlife, cozy fires
and bubble baths for two.

36:40.114 --> 36:43.140
Reach out and tell me your dreams.
Your future Mrs...

36:43.284 --> 36:44.751
W-R-l-T-E.

36:44.886 --> 36:46.581
Can have the pick of the litter,
Buster.

36:46.921 --> 36:51.688
Casanova Cop and his naughty
nightstick seek receptacle for love.

36:51.993 --> 36:53.483
Are you kidding?
Half of these dames, they...

36:53.628 --> 36:55.027
keep their teeth in a jar.

36:55.162 --> 36:57.027
They take dinner through
a god damn straw at night.

36:57.198 --> 36:58.859
Not Patty Forsythe.

36:59.333 --> 37:00.391
These dames really want a date...

37:00.534 --> 37:02.365
they need to go straight
for the meat and potatoes.

37:02.503 --> 37:03.231
Okay?

37:03.371 --> 37:06.534
Wild female, she's rich, she likes
to cook, she likes to fuck.

37:06.707 --> 37:08.971
Need a personal post office
just to bag the mail.

37:09.076 --> 37:10.634
Well that's how I found your wife.

37:10.878 --> 37:12.436
What?
I didn't- I'm sorry, I was far away.

37:12.580 --> 37:13.512
I couldn't hear what the...
fuck you said.

37:13.648 --> 37:15.172
Come here,
you motherfucker.

37:16.684 --> 37:20.450
Very loving, older female
considered attractive,

37:20.588 --> 37:23.523
and compassionate and ready
to enjoy life to the fullest...

37:24.158 --> 37:28.254
Ioves ballroom dancing
and nights under the stars.

37:30.965 --> 37:31.829
What d'ya got?

37:31.966 --> 37:34.366
Mrs. Forsythe closed her
personal account five days ago.

37:34.502 --> 37:36.629
She wrote a check
from this account

37:36.771 --> 37:39.296
and they deposited
it into a joint account.

37:39.440 --> 37:40.702
With Ray Martin?

37:40.841 --> 37:41.432
That's right.

37:41.575 --> 37:42.735
How much did she deposit?

37:42.977 --> 37:46.276
Mr. Martin deposited, let's see,
forty-eight hundred seventy dollars.

37:46.414 --> 37:48.905
Mrs. Forsythe transferred the
balance of her personal account...

37:49.050 --> 37:51.109
six thousand six hundred
twenty-three dollars.

37:51.252 --> 37:52.014
Six thousand?

37:52.153 --> 37:53.552
For a combined...
total of eleven thousand,

37:53.688 --> 37:56.282
four hundred and ninety-three
dollars in the... joint account.

37:56.424 --> 37:59.018
And now... you're saying that
account is closed as well?

37:59.460 --> 38:01.860
The next day
Mr. Martin withdrew the balance.

38:01.996 --> 38:02.860
And that was a check?

38:02.997 --> 38:04.555
No... cash.

38:08.369 --> 38:09.563
Thank you.

38:20.581 --> 38:21.479
So?

38:21.716 --> 38:23.206
She had almost seven thousand.

38:23.617 --> 38:25.346
Yeah, seven thousand dollars
at thirty-five bucks

38:25.486 --> 38:27.249
a week is almost
four years pay.

38:27.388 --> 38:28.616
Where'd she get that?

38:28.756 --> 38:29.950
Figure it out.

38:30.024 --> 38:32.185
What's the army death benefit pay,
ten grand?

38:32.326 --> 38:33.088
Yeah, about.

38:33.227 --> 38:35.286
Okay. Well her husband
died in forty-four.

38:35.429 --> 38:38.887
She gets a part-time job,
lives off the death benefit.

38:39.066 --> 38:42.433
That's the number.
That's what she had to steal.

38:43.704 --> 38:45.968
Still, it ain't murder.

38:46.140 --> 38:47.164
Not yet.

38:55.883 --> 38:59.375
Well...
welcome home, Janette.

39:08.362 --> 39:09.886
I know it's not much
to look at, darling.

39:10.031 --> 39:11.555
It's one of my rentals.

39:16.037 --> 39:18.096
It's just
for a couple of nights.

39:18.572 --> 39:21.905
Look... we get our business out
of the way in the morning,

39:22.777 --> 39:24.768
go to the church
in the afternoon,

39:25.646 --> 39:28.706
we'll be on our honeymoon...
by Tuesday.

39:30.484 --> 39:32.179
Is she coming with us?

39:32.586 --> 39:34.144
Who, Martha?

39:35.256 --> 39:36.917
She doesn't like me, Raymond.

39:37.858 --> 39:39.553
Well how can you say that?
Martha likes everybody.

39:39.693 --> 39:40.591
She's a nurse.

39:40.728 --> 39:42.992
She didn't say a single thing to me,
the whole trip,

39:43.130 --> 39:45.792
just glared at me
in the mirror.

39:47.501 --> 39:52.495
Well, even if that were true,
it's none of our business, is it?

39:53.441 --> 39:54.908
No it isn't.

39:55.876 --> 39:57.343
You need a hand?

39:57.511 --> 39:59.342
No, but I think the kitchen might.

39:59.513 --> 40:00.844
I'll take... care of it.

40:00.981 --> 40:04.075
She's alone Janette.
You're a beautiful woman.

40:05.019 --> 40:11.447
You and me, we got each other.
She sees that.

40:13.194 --> 40:14.627
It's difficult.

40:14.962 --> 40:16.759
I hadn't thought
about it that way.

40:19.500 --> 40:22.526
You want me to get her a hotel
for the night, I will. I will.

40:25.439 --> 40:27.703
Or maybe you and
I should go to a hotel, huh?

40:29.643 --> 40:31.110
That'd be fun.

40:32.480 --> 40:35.142
I suppose I can take
it a while longer if she can.

40:35.282 --> 40:37.876
Mm. That's a good girl.

40:42.156 --> 40:48.425
Okay. We'll make it work.
No problems. Forget about her.

40:49.396 --> 40:52.194
It's you and me, kid.
Come on, let's get in there.

40:54.835 --> 40:56.166
Tea time.

40:58.739 --> 41:02.300
Janette, lemon, honey?

41:04.445 --> 41:05.935
Nothing. No thank you.

41:06.080 --> 41:07.445
How 'bout you, Ray?

41:07.915 --> 41:09.348
You want honey?

41:12.253 --> 41:14.084
I wanted to surprise you.

41:17.324 --> 41:18.655
That's wonderful.

41:18.792 --> 41:20.282
Martha, find some tools.
We'll hang it up.

41:20.427 --> 41:22.292
You're gonna... ruin him.

41:35.609 --> 41:39.443
She's right, you know?
You're too good to me.

41:43.851 --> 41:47.582
I'm- I'm cold.
I think I'll run a bath.

41:48.689 --> 41:53.683
Why don't you give me a
few minutes and sneak in with me?

41:54.528 --> 41:57.964
Okay.
I'll see ya soon.

42:11.412 --> 42:12.208
Ray?

42:12.346 --> 42:13.813
It's all right.

42:14.281 --> 42:15.714
There, you do it.

42:16.717 --> 42:18.184
What the hell is wrong with you?

42:18.552 --> 42:19.484
Excuse me?

42:19.653 --> 42:21.746
Are you trying to blow this?

42:22.022 --> 42:23.284
What are you talking about?

42:23.457 --> 42:26.017
You are driving her crazy.

42:26.193 --> 42:29.788
Staring at her in the car.
God damn tea?

42:29.930 --> 42:31.557
You want me to
send you to a hotel?

42:31.699 --> 42:32.631
How dare you.

42:32.766 --> 42:35.234
I've been so nice to that old cow.

42:35.369 --> 42:38.167
And you two have been treating
me like the fucking maid.

42:38.305 --> 42:40.068
I'm not gonna put up
with it, Ray.

42:40.341 --> 42:42.206
We are getting out
of here right now.

42:42.343 --> 42:43.935
We don't have the money,
Martha.

42:44.078 --> 42:45.602
Ray.

42:46.680 --> 42:49.808
It's alright, it's alright.
In a minute.

42:49.950 --> 42:51.508
What... about that other girl,
the one from Michigan...

42:51.652 --> 42:52.846
the one with the kid?

42:53.053 --> 42:53.849
That's the real money.

42:53.988 --> 42:56.081
We don't... need this whore.
Let's... leave right now.

42:56.223 --> 42:58.282
Are you listening to
anything that I'm... saying?

42:58.959 --> 43:00.017
Anything?

43:00.461 --> 43:04.830
All of our cash, all of it,
is in her bank account.

43:05.733 --> 43:09.430
Ray, I... don't care
about the money.

43:09.970 --> 43:13.133
Look, sit down.
Sit down for a second.

43:14.908 --> 43:16.842
The checks clear
Monday morning.

43:16.977 --> 43:18.205
Okay?
Monday morning.

43:18.345 --> 43:19.812
- Baby.
- It'll be all over.

43:19.947 --> 43:22.415
- Baby, I can't wait 'til Monday.
- I promise, it'll all be over.

43:23.250 --> 43:23.875
Come on.

43:24.018 --> 43:25.076
That's enough.

43:25.219 --> 43:29.087
Please, let's just get out of here.
Come on. Let's go.

43:29.223 --> 43:31.714
- You got such a fire, baby...
- Come on.

43:31.859 --> 43:33.326
You put it out with this.

43:33.560 --> 43:38.520
But I'm not leaving without my money.
Got it?

43:58.018 --> 43:59.246
You need any help?

43:59.520 --> 44:01.852
Yeah. Keep that dog out of here.
There's glue all over.

44:01.955 --> 44:07.484
Skip. Skipper. Skipper.
Skipper, come on. Come on, boy.

44:11.332 --> 44:14.733
Here uh, I got...

44:15.736 --> 44:16.998
What's that?

44:17.237 --> 44:19.637
Billy G's... paying me
a dollar and a half a week.

44:19.773 --> 44:20.933
What for?

44:21.375 --> 44:23.866
On account of he's got...
uh, football practice,

44:24.011 --> 44:26.571
doesn't wanna lose
his paper route, so.

44:27.748 --> 44:29.340
Why aren't you
playing football?

44:30.384 --> 44:31.942
Gotta pitch papers.

44:33.821 --> 44:36.449
Well it's gonna take a lot of papers to...
pay for that fender.

44:36.590 --> 44:37.716
I know.

44:43.330 --> 44:47.767
Why don't ya pick up a block...
help me. Go 'head.

44:50.571 --> 44:51.902
Wipe it down with this.

45:01.682 --> 45:03.775
Tell me you love me, baby.

45:04.885 --> 45:06.910
I want to hear you say it.

45:08.589 --> 45:09.851
Yeah, sure.

45:09.990 --> 45:11.150
Say my name.

45:12.192 --> 45:13.591
What are you talking about?

45:13.994 --> 45:15.291
My name.

45:16.797 --> 45:18.128
Say my name.

45:20.300 --> 45:23.861
Come on. Janette.

45:24.004 --> 45:26.802
Say I, I love you.

45:31.712 --> 45:33.339
I love you Kitty Cat.

45:34.148 --> 45:36.639
I do. Come on.

45:37.851 --> 45:39.375
Oo!

45:40.754 --> 45:42.119
Oh my god.

45:43.123 --> 45:43.953
Oh...

45:44.091 --> 45:45.217
Jesus Christ!

45:45.359 --> 45:46.917
You trying to drive...
me crazy?

45:47.127 --> 45:49.391
Do you enjoy...
playing with my heart like this, huh?

45:49.530 --> 45:50.656
Hurting me like this?

45:50.798 --> 45:53.824
No... baby, no.
I was just working.

45:54.134 --> 45:57.535
Son of a bitch!
You called... her my name!

45:57.671 --> 45:59.002
You called her fucking...

45:59.139 --> 46:00.538
- No-no-no-no.
- My...

46:00.674 --> 46:01.800
No.

46:01.942 --> 46:02.966
I... heard you.

46:03.110 --> 46:05.510
My eyes...
were closed, Kitty Cat.

46:06.513 --> 46:07.775
I was with you.
Don't you see?

46:07.915 --> 46:10.247
The only way
I could do it was to see you.

46:11.351 --> 46:13.114
I'm always with... you.

46:14.188 --> 46:17.123
I'm always with you.
I'm always...

46:18.826 --> 46:20.953
Yeah. Mm-hm.

46:21.228 --> 46:22.718
I love you, Ray.

46:31.071 --> 46:32.299
Oh, yeah.

46:35.309 --> 46:37.038
Mm, Kitty Cat.

46:37.244 --> 46:39.144
No, no baby, no.

46:39.480 --> 46:40.947
No-no-no,
wait-wait-wait-wait-wait.

46:41.081 --> 46:42.844
Wait.
Don't stop, Kitty Cat.

46:42.983 --> 46:45.008
- No let me...
- Don't stop.

46:45.185 --> 46:46.516
No.

46:47.321 --> 46:49.255
Close your eyes now.

46:49.823 --> 46:51.518
And finish yourself.

46:53.026 --> 46:55.517
I want to see you see me.

46:56.263 --> 47:01.599
And Raymond...
if you're lying, I'll know.

47:03.170 --> 47:05.070
I'll see your heart.

47:16.116 --> 47:18.778
Baby. Close your eyes.

47:31.164 --> 47:35.328
Oh, god Martha,
you made such a mess.

47:39.106 --> 47:41.301
Oh, Martha.

47:50.884 --> 47:53.614
Rene.
What're you doin' here?

47:54.454 --> 47:55.284
You shouldn't be here.

47:55.422 --> 48:01.361
No. No.
You never answer your phone, and...

48:01.662 --> 48:03.823
I try to get you, you show...
up in the middle of the night.

48:03.964 --> 48:04.862
- Oh...
- And when something happens,

48:04.998 --> 48:06.124
I don't know how to get a hold...
of you.

48:06.266 --> 48:06.994
What happened?

48:07.134 --> 48:08.158
My father.

48:08.302 --> 48:09.326
What?

48:09.469 --> 48:10.834
My dad died.

48:11.138 --> 48:14.232
I just need you to hold me.

48:15.876 --> 48:18.071
I found him in the kitchen.

48:20.681 --> 48:22.171
My daddy.

48:22.749 --> 48:24.512
Come on, let's- let's...
go inside.

48:27.521 --> 48:28.783
Where is he now?

48:29.923 --> 48:31.185
Dad.

48:31.692 --> 48:33.091
Eddie, don't.

48:35.896 --> 48:36.954
Eddie.

48:38.398 --> 48:39.660
Eddie.

48:54.615 --> 48:56.014
You're gonna break it.

48:57.017 --> 48:58.609
Well she don't fit.

49:01.221 --> 49:02.745
I'll make her fit.

49:09.630 --> 49:11.120
The bitch won't die.

49:26.380 --> 49:27.540
Why'd she do it?

49:30.751 --> 49:32.116
Was it because...
of that woman?

49:32.252 --> 49:33.344
No.

49:34.121 --> 49:36.555
Though I can't say at the time
I didn't think about it.

49:36.990 --> 49:38.719
Well I guess
you got what you wanted.

49:39.626 --> 49:41.093
You...
have no idea what I want.

49:41.228 --> 49:43.093
Then why don't you...
explain it to me.

49:47.434 --> 49:48.731
'Cause you can't.

50:17.030 --> 50:18.019
Holster your weapons.

50:18.999 --> 50:20.296
You're... gonna love this.

50:20.400 --> 50:21.799
Missing Persons blotter.

50:21.935 --> 50:22.867
Lady says
her mother disappeared

50:23.003 --> 50:24.368
three days ago
with two characters that...

50:24.504 --> 50:26.131
sound like our friends
from Wantaugh.

50:26.873 --> 50:28.101
Off to Florida.

50:28.308 --> 50:29.673
Cleared out her bank account.

50:29.910 --> 50:31.002
Ray Martin?

50:31.378 --> 50:34.211
It's gotta be.
It's also gotta be an alias.

50:39.519 --> 50:40.679
Coffee?

50:41.054 --> 50:43.045
No, no-no, after.

50:52.766 --> 50:54.131
We need to talk.

50:54.968 --> 50:56.333
About what?

50:56.770 --> 50:58.032
About us.

51:00.140 --> 51:01.903
I think about the future,
Raymond.

51:02.442 --> 51:04.171
Planning...
the future, huh?

51:05.445 --> 51:06.935
See, there you go again.

51:08.115 --> 51:10.879
There I go what? Hm?

51:11.852 --> 51:13.911
I'm trying to talk about something
that's important to me,

51:14.054 --> 51:17.148
something that means something.
And you get sarcastic.

51:17.524 --> 51:22.052
Look, I'm tired.
Okay? I'm sorry.

51:23.430 --> 51:26.058
What do you wanna talk about?
Come here.

51:30.604 --> 51:31.798
Let's talk.

51:32.139 --> 51:33.071
Don't laugh.

51:33.206 --> 51:35.333
Mm... I promise.

51:39.446 --> 51:40.879
I want a baby.

51:43.283 --> 51:44.580
A baby?

51:44.718 --> 51:46.982
I don't wanna be alone the...
rest of my life.

51:48.188 --> 51:49.712
Babies don't leave.

51:52.626 --> 51:53.888
I'd like that.

51:53.994 --> 51:55.359
Don't bullshit me, Raymond.

51:55.495 --> 51:56.985
No, I would...
like that.

51:59.432 --> 52:05.803
You know, to have a boy, a son,

52:06.039 --> 52:09.941
I could take the track,
ballgames or something.

52:11.978 --> 52:13.468
Or maybe a little girl,

52:14.147 --> 52:18.277
I could buy dresses for,
little shoes, dolls.

52:18.518 --> 52:21.009
My own little princess
who calls me Daddy.

52:21.388 --> 52:22.582
What's not to like?

52:29.029 --> 52:30.360
You mean that?

52:30.497 --> 52:31.759
Of course I mean it.

52:32.465 --> 52:33.659
We'd... have to get
the hell outta here, though.

52:33.800 --> 52:35.768
City's no place to raise a kid.

52:36.336 --> 52:37.860
No. Too many creeps.

52:42.976 --> 52:47.640
Yeah. Well Kitty Cat, we get our
business out of the way, we'll be set.

52:48.448 --> 52:50.109
Get some money socked away,

52:50.984 --> 52:53.452
get a place upriver,
Croton or Hastings.

52:53.820 --> 52:56.983
We can do anything.
We can do whatever we want.

52:57.557 --> 52:59.957
I'll put a bun in the oven,
we'll be on our way.

53:01.528 --> 53:02.756
What's the matter?
What did I say?

53:02.896 --> 53:06.059
What did I do now?
What's the matter?

53:08.301 --> 53:11.566
I'm crying because I'm happy.

53:24.784 --> 53:25.716
That's your mother?

53:25.852 --> 53:26.876
Yeah.

53:27.020 --> 53:27.816
How old is she?

53:27.954 --> 53:29.182
Fifty-three.

53:29.789 --> 53:31.950
Yeah.
How long they been together?

53:32.259 --> 53:33.726
About three months.

53:34.594 --> 53:35.993
Big age difference, huh?

53:36.129 --> 53:36.618
Yeah.

53:36.763 --> 53:37.889
Yeah.

53:38.398 --> 53:42.630
Says here she's happy, she eloped,
she'll call you when she gets settled.

53:42.936 --> 53:43.834
What's wrong with that?

53:43.904 --> 53:45.337
It's not her writing.

53:46.139 --> 53:49.233
Well you mean, you uh, actually
positive that that's not her writing?

53:49.376 --> 53:50.434
Yeah.

53:51.211 --> 53:53.873
How 'bout money?
Did your mother have money?

53:54.247 --> 53:56.613
Around five thousand,
plus a house.

53:56.716 --> 53:58.547
Yeah? You check with the bank?

53:58.685 --> 54:01.051
The house was sold.
She cleared out all the accounts.

54:02.289 --> 54:04.223
How 'bout uh, this guy,
you ever seen him?

54:04.357 --> 54:04.982
Met him?

54:05.125 --> 54:06.422
Yeah.

54:06.593 --> 54:08.151
How 'bout his sister,
she ever around?

54:08.295 --> 54:14.996
She don't like me very much.
Listen, this ain't right.

54:17.337 --> 54:20.864
The suspect in the photograph goes
by the name of Raymond Martin.

54:21.241 --> 54:24.369
The woman standing next to
him is the missing person.

54:24.511 --> 54:26.445
Her name is Janette Long.

54:26.947 --> 54:31.145
Apparently he travels with a uh,
woman who claims that she's his sister.

54:31.418 --> 54:33.477
We don't know much
about her other than uh...

54:33.620 --> 54:35.611
she's romantically linked to Martin.

54:38.825 --> 54:40.725
If you've got any information
or you see anything,

54:40.860 --> 54:43.226
you know, let... us know.

54:44.864 --> 54:47.230
Thank you for letting us
intrude on your precinct.

54:47.734 --> 54:48.792
Thank you.

54:56.776 --> 55:01.110
Excuse me. Excuse me.
You didn't look at the picture.

55:01.281 --> 55:02.475
Yeah, sure I did.

55:03.249 --> 55:04.511
Can I show you something?

55:06.519 --> 55:07.850
I mean you gotta ask yourself...

55:07.988 --> 55:11.424
why would a beautiful girl hop
in a tub and do that to herself?

55:12.359 --> 55:13.986
You know what I think, Officer...

55:14.694 --> 55:15.991
Chetnick?

55:16.296 --> 55:16.990
I think that these two...

55:17.130 --> 55:19.223
barnacles figured out
that she was alone,

55:19.566 --> 55:20.692
and that
she was getting money from

55:20.834 --> 55:24.395
her dead hero husband
and a GI insurance policy.

55:24.904 --> 55:28.431
A beautiful girl
with a baby inside her.

55:31.644 --> 55:33.771
Take a look.
Take another look.

55:37.817 --> 55:38.442
Excuse me.

55:38.585 --> 55:39.074
You know...

55:39.219 --> 55:40.345
this is kind of a heartache.

55:40.487 --> 55:42.921
You know, maybe the only way to
resolve it is with a razor blade.

55:44.524 --> 55:48.119
But they're gonna do it again,
and it could even be in your backyard.

55:48.795 --> 55:50.126
How are you gonna live with that?

56:03.176 --> 56:04.404
What the hell was that?

56:04.544 --> 56:05.602
I don't know.

56:06.713 --> 56:08.840
Call a hotel 'cause
I'm not flying in this shit.

56:08.948 --> 56:10.040
It's ridiculous.

56:10.283 --> 56:12.308
Where d'you keep your balls,
in a fucking safe?

56:12.619 --> 56:14.780
You know, you're right,
let's be daring and see what happens.

56:15.021 --> 56:15.885
Try it out.

56:16.022 --> 56:17.216
All right,
it's raining a little bit.

56:17.357 --> 56:18.289
A little bit?

56:18.425 --> 56:19.687
Let's stand here.

56:23.696 --> 56:25.129
Detective Robinson.

56:34.207 --> 56:36.334
I pulled 'em over
on a possible DUI.

56:36.476 --> 56:39.138
Don't know if they're your pair or not.
The guy was bald.

56:39.279 --> 56:40.712
He might've wore a rug, though.

56:40.980 --> 56:41.912
How do you know that?

56:42.048 --> 56:44.039
Tape on his dome, you know?
Double stick.

56:44.184 --> 56:45.811
I thought that
was kind of screwy.

56:50.123 --> 56:51.021
Did you run this?

56:51.157 --> 56:52.852
Didn't have to.
He wasn't drunk.

56:54.094 --> 56:55.789
Why didn't
you tell me this before?

56:56.062 --> 56:58.030
No. Out.
That's all you get.

56:58.298 --> 56:59.458
Right.

57:01.034 --> 57:02.399
I'll tell you this, though.

57:04.037 --> 57:06.164
The... sister that's with him,
she's crazy.

57:06.372 --> 57:06.861
How do you mean?

57:07.006 --> 57:09.474
Unstable, you know?
Fucked up in the head.

57:11.277 --> 57:13.006
Wouldn't believe
a damn thing she says.

57:16.483 --> 57:17.814
Thanks.

57:22.522 --> 57:23.454
Come on.

57:23.857 --> 57:26.951
I got a name, I got a number.
Let's go.

57:27.427 --> 57:28.394
Where you going?

57:28.962 --> 57:30.896
You know tonight is
the kind when accidents happen.

57:32.365 --> 57:33.423
He's Raymond Martinez...

57:33.566 --> 57:36.831
Fernandez. Alias Ray Martin.
Alias Shit stick.

57:37.837 --> 57:41.000
Incarcerated Tallahassee
for burglary, larceny.

57:41.274 --> 57:42.969
Oh, did a year at
Bass Creek for polygamy.

57:43.109 --> 57:44.235
No kidding.

57:44.410 --> 57:46.901
Married twice.
Jane Thompson.

57:47.113 --> 57:49.843
She keeled over... of a heart
attack on the honeymoon in Spain.

57:50.550 --> 57:53.781
Second wife, Myrtle Young,
OD'd on Phenobarbital.

57:54.053 --> 57:56.385
Goes belly-up after they stick
her on a bus back to Little Rock.

57:56.523 --> 57:57.649
The guy's... prolific.

57:57.790 --> 57:58.518
Got an address?

57:58.658 --> 58:01.058
Yeah. P.O. Box in
Ansonia Station in Manhattan.

58:01.361 --> 58:02.589
Big spender.

58:03.062 --> 58:04.256
This is good.

58:05.698 --> 58:08.326
Well, we'll need a warrant.
Get the Leprechaun on it.

58:08.468 --> 58:09.662
Reilly!

58:24.684 --> 58:27.050
So you got uh, any idea how long

58:27.187 --> 58:29.121
it's been since
this guy checked his mail?

58:29.689 --> 58:30.713
Quite a while.

58:31.157 --> 58:32.181
Check the postmarks.

58:32.325 --> 58:33.587
What about this,
how's he pay for this?

58:33.726 --> 58:35.887
Does he have
a billing address?

58:36.095 --> 58:37.528
Yeah, Detective.

58:38.364 --> 58:39.422
Okay, what is it?

58:39.532 --> 58:41.022
You're standing next to it.

58:41.167 --> 58:42.634
Uh, that's
why people have mailboxes,

58:42.769 --> 58:44.464
so that they...
can get their mail.

58:44.604 --> 58:46.731
You know, we should have
Eastman check electric... telephone.

58:46.873 --> 58:48.067
There's gotta
be a trail on this guy.

58:48.208 --> 58:49.573
- Right.
- Yeah.

58:49.709 --> 58:51.643
Somebody's gotta stay
with the box though, right?

58:52.412 --> 58:53.037
Yeah.

58:53.179 --> 58:54.976
Yeah. Reilly, it's you.

58:55.548 --> 58:56.310
What's me?

58:56.449 --> 58:58.781
Hold on, whoa-whoa-whoa,
whoa-whoa, hey... come on.

58:59.052 --> 59:00.679
I'm not staying
with the fucking...

59:00.920 --> 59:02.478
Stay with the box!

59:02.922 --> 59:04.321
I haven't even had my lunch.

59:05.158 --> 59:06.386
Alright.

59:09.362 --> 59:10.693
Come on, you idiot.

59:10.863 --> 59:12.091
Going!

59:12.632 --> 59:13.564
What?

59:13.700 --> 59:16.601
What? I'm a little up
to here from him.

59:18.838 --> 59:22.137
All first names.
P.O. Boxes from all over.

59:22.275 --> 59:25.506
Meredith from Deluth.
Sally from Wheaton.

59:26.312 --> 59:28.177
But this is shit.
We can't take this to the D.A.

59:28.314 --> 59:30.839
Well just keep looking.
Don't come in here with bad news.

59:31.584 --> 59:33.552
Well do you know how many
spic-ass Fernandez motherfuckers

59:33.686 --> 59:35.449
there are on the
Con Edison rolls?

59:36.623 --> 59:37.612
No, how many?

59:37.757 --> 59:39.088
Thousands.

59:39.959 --> 59:42.894
You wanna know how many Raymond
Martinez Fernandezes there are?

59:43.029 --> 59:44.360
Put us out of our misery.

59:45.231 --> 59:52.069
Just one. In Valley Stream.
Out by the airport.

59:52.205 --> 59:53.229
No kidding.

59:56.843 --> 59:58.276
- All right.
- Let's go.

59:58.778 --> 01:00:02.942
He even paid his bill.
What a fuckin' idiot.

01:00:06.653 --> 01:00:08.177
- Gonna knock, right?
- Right.

01:00:23.403 --> 01:00:24.495
We're in!

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:29.034
Bathroom's clean.

01:00:30.743 --> 01:00:31.971
Nobody in the kitchen.

01:00:32.645 --> 01:00:34.044
They've gone.
They skinned out.

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:35.306
We just missed 'em.

01:00:35.448 --> 01:00:36.506
How do you know that?

01:00:36.683 --> 01:00:37.775
Look, there's food on the table.

01:00:37.917 --> 01:00:39.384
The lights are on.
The heat's on.

01:00:39.519 --> 01:00:42.249
Check the milk outside.
Pay attention.

01:00:42.722 --> 01:00:44.451
They could still be upstate,
for all we know.

01:00:44.891 --> 01:00:45.880
Or in Lauderdale by now.

01:00:46.025 --> 01:00:47.458
Maybe...
they're on the fuckin' moon.

01:00:47.593 --> 01:00:49.083
Hey, check
the god damn basement.

01:00:49.429 --> 01:00:50.418
Go.

01:00:50.596 --> 01:00:51.722
Come on.

01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:54.499
Come here.

01:00:54.634 --> 01:00:55.999
We have to check the basement.

01:00:56.502 --> 01:00:58.026
Thought... we were gonna knock.

01:00:58.171 --> 01:00:59.468
You did.

01:01:00.406 --> 01:01:01.430
What's your problem?

01:01:01.541 --> 01:01:02.565
You. You're my problem.

01:01:02.709 --> 01:01:03.266
I'm your problem?

01:01:03.409 --> 01:01:05.843
Yeah. It's like you don't
wanna catch bad guys anymore.

01:01:05.912 --> 01:01:07.709
Yeah, I do.
But I'm a homicide cop.

01:01:07.847 --> 01:01:08.814
This is bunko all the way.

01:01:08.948 --> 01:01:11.439
That's not what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about your coasting.

01:01:11.584 --> 01:01:13.779
You're talking about poker,
you're talking about pension.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:14.852
Like you don't give a shit.

01:01:14.987 --> 01:01:16.079
Oh I give a shit.

01:01:16.255 --> 01:01:19.554
Grand larceny, polygamy,
incest, maybe.

01:01:19.692 --> 01:01:21.216
They're all Ionely hearts.
Who gives a shit?

01:01:21.361 --> 01:01:23.329
She's probably sucking on
a coconut in Florida right now.

01:01:23.463 --> 01:01:25.693
This homicide thing
is all in your head.

01:01:25.832 --> 01:01:27.891
It- it's a zero.
It's all fiction.

01:01:28.034 --> 01:01:28.625
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:01:28.768 --> 01:01:29.894
Then why is MacSwain all over it?

01:01:30.036 --> 01:01:32.732
And if I'm so screwed up,
why did they put you on it, huh?

01:01:32.872 --> 01:01:34.840
Well I think
that question answers itself.

01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:39.100
You better get down here.

01:02:08.841 --> 01:02:12.641
Spatter on the walls, blood,
bone, brains, but no bullet.

01:02:12.779 --> 01:02:14.144
Soap underneath the baseboard.

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:15.474
They thinned it out
when they cleaned up.

01:02:15.615 --> 01:02:16.639
But no body.

01:02:16.783 --> 01:02:17.613
Sure there is.

01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:20.241
Somewhere.
It's a total bleed-out.

01:02:21.187 --> 01:02:21.949
Who's this?

01:02:22.088 --> 01:02:23.180
It's the landlord.

01:02:24.223 --> 01:02:25.451
When's the last time you saw 'em?

01:02:26.292 --> 01:02:26.917
Speak English.

01:02:27.059 --> 01:02:29.493
I already told him.
Now who's going to pay for my floor?

01:02:29.662 --> 01:02:30.594
Three days ago.

01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:32.755
Son of a bitch, he had lease...
with me.

01:02:32.932 --> 01:02:35.332
I make out, though.
Fifty... dollar deposit.

01:02:35.468 --> 01:02:37.868
Good.
You can pay for it yourself.

01:02:39.872 --> 01:02:41.305
Albany make... the car?

01:02:41.441 --> 01:02:44.205
Yeah. Forty-seven Plymouth.
Stolen.

01:02:44.343 --> 01:02:46.607
Probably switches plates
every time he winds his watch.

01:02:46.746 --> 01:02:48.941
What about my door, huh?

01:02:50.583 --> 01:02:52.175
Think we're goin'.

01:02:52.885 --> 01:02:54.011
Get outta the way.

01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:55.819
Hey buddy.

01:02:57.089 --> 01:02:59.580
Now everything matches...
you stupid piece of shit.

01:03:00.526 --> 01:03:01.993
You got any more questions?

01:03:05.364 --> 01:03:06.592
We just missed 'em.

01:03:06.833 --> 01:03:10.667
They were only five miles away
buying a Desoto flop top in Seaford.

01:03:11.137 --> 01:03:12.934
But they might as
well have been on the moon.

01:03:13.973 --> 01:03:17.602
We were so close,
but we lost 'em.

01:03:19.111 --> 01:03:20.601
And it all went cold.

01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:44.195
Hello.

01:03:44.804 --> 01:03:45.771
I'm Ray.

01:03:45.938 --> 01:03:47.098
I... know.

01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:53.945
Uh, this is my daughter,
Rainelle.

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.277
Hello Rainelle.

01:03:56.782 --> 01:03:58.579
This is a picture I made.
This is...

01:03:58.718 --> 01:04:01.812
Mommy, this is me,
and this is... you.

01:04:03.022 --> 01:04:04.011
How about that.

01:04:04.156 --> 01:04:05.646
You're so talented.

01:04:06.192 --> 01:04:07.284
Oh.

01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:09.391
Thank you.

01:04:09.662 --> 01:04:10.754
Can I show you my... room?

01:04:10.897 --> 01:04:12.228
Of course you can.

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:18.227
Is it this way, right?
Okay.

01:04:20.907 --> 01:04:22.169
Do you have any pets, huh?

01:04:22.308 --> 01:04:22.831
Um...

01:04:22.975 --> 01:04:25.000
Little frog or something,
perhaps?

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:29.475
You must be Martha.

01:04:29.782 --> 01:04:31.773
Nice to meet you, Delphine.

01:04:31.951 --> 01:04:34.317
It... means so much to me
that you give up your nursing job,

01:04:34.453 --> 01:04:35.920
you come all the
way here with Ray.

01:04:36.055 --> 01:04:37.818
Please.

01:04:38.224 --> 01:04:39.851
Let me look at you.

01:04:42.862 --> 01:04:44.796
So pretty.

01:05:03.583 --> 01:05:07.542
It's okay, boy. It's okay.
You're fine. Okay...

01:05:08.588 --> 01:05:10.021
Oh, you got one.

01:05:10.756 --> 01:05:11.723
Yeah.

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:15.390
You caught all those?

01:05:15.528 --> 01:05:16.495
Yup.

01:05:17.063 --> 01:05:18.860
Dog doesn't like 'em.
Do you, now?

01:05:18.998 --> 01:05:20.090
Come here, Skip.

01:05:20.266 --> 01:05:21.392
It's okay.

01:05:26.205 --> 01:05:27.433
Watch out.

01:05:33.379 --> 01:05:35.176
Sorry about your dad.

01:05:36.048 --> 01:05:37.345
Thank you.

01:05:41.921 --> 01:05:43.548
Did you uh, wanna... try?

01:05:45.324 --> 01:05:46.621
- Sure.
- It's- it's easy.

01:05:46.759 --> 01:05:47.691
Alright.

01:05:49.261 --> 01:05:52.355
Take the rope...
it's kind of... Pick that up and...

01:05:52.498 --> 01:05:53.556
It's getting worn.

01:06:06.579 --> 01:06:07.443
Good afternoon.

01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:08.706
What the hell you doing?

01:06:09.348 --> 01:06:11.612
Boiling crabs.
What's it look like?

01:06:12.084 --> 01:06:13.745
No, what the hell's
she doing here?

01:06:15.254 --> 01:06:17.745
I invited the squad.
She's part of the... squad.

01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:19.915
She's talking to my son,
for Christ's sake.

01:06:20.226 --> 01:06:21.284
So what?

01:06:21.694 --> 01:06:22.854
Well, he don't understand.

01:06:22.995 --> 01:06:24.394
Maybe you should explain it
to him.

01:06:24.864 --> 01:06:26.456
Then maybe you should
explain it to me.

01:06:26.832 --> 01:06:29.960
Look, who I'm banging...
he doesn't need to know about.

01:06:30.202 --> 01:06:33.103
- Nice. Thank you very much.
- Rene, look, he's fifteen.

01:06:33.673 --> 01:06:34.435
How am I supposed to say

01:06:34.573 --> 01:06:36.803
I'm- I'm with a woman
that's not his mother, huh?

01:06:36.909 --> 01:06:39.776
You don't need to say it.
He already knows you're banging me.

01:06:39.912 --> 01:06:41.641
Ida knows you're banging me.
Everybody knows.

01:06:41.781 --> 01:06:43.146
Well you know, they do now.

01:06:43.282 --> 01:06:44.078
So what's your problem?

01:06:44.216 --> 01:06:45.513
I don't got a problem.

01:06:45.818 --> 01:06:47.149
Sure you do.

01:06:49.455 --> 01:06:51.446
You wanna know what I think?

01:06:52.825 --> 01:06:56.022
I think your son hasn't cried
yet 'cause he's waiting for you to.

01:06:59.265 --> 01:07:00.892
You know everything, don't ya?

01:07:03.169 --> 01:07:07.936
Oh come on.
It doesn't have to be that hard, okay?

01:07:12.845 --> 01:07:13.834
All right.

01:07:45.277 --> 01:07:46.244
It's me.

01:07:46.645 --> 01:07:48.306
Why don't you come over.

01:07:49.515 --> 01:07:51.483
No. Now.

01:07:52.251 --> 01:07:53.912
I know this son of a bitch.

01:07:54.186 --> 01:07:55.448
And he ain't happy.

01:07:56.655 --> 01:07:58.213
This is
why I'm here on a Sunday?

01:07:58.357 --> 01:08:00.518
Yeah, shit bags don't keep...
store hours, Charlie.

01:08:00.726 --> 01:08:02.353
Yeah, and the dead'II...
still be dead in the morning.

01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:04.690
He's fleecing women,
having the good life.

01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:07.390
Cars, money.
He loved his life.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:11.366
Then suddenly he's banging the sister
on his girlfriend's kitchen table?

01:08:12.471 --> 01:08:14.234
Blood in the...
bathtub, blood in the floorboards.

01:08:14.373 --> 01:08:15.840
Who knows where else?

01:08:16.008 --> 01:08:16.736
It's a mess.

01:08:16.876 --> 01:08:18.309
Maybe she ain't his sister.

01:08:18.511 --> 01:08:23.971
Maybe she's one of his marks or,
maybe she's got her claws into him.

01:08:24.116 --> 01:08:25.743
Yeah, that's...
what I was thinking.

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:29.719
Can't keep a guy like that down,
not for long.

01:08:30.122 --> 01:08:32.386
He's restless.
He wants... his life back.

01:08:33.058 --> 01:08:34.923
He's gonna try to dump her,
and when he does,

01:08:35.594 --> 01:08:37.255
Hell's coming home
for Christmas.

01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:50.569
- You're such a sweet little girl.
- Thank you.

01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:53.371
- This is the life. Huh, kid?
- Yeah.

01:08:56.381 --> 01:08:58.816
Who ever thought he'd take
a shine to babies.

01:09:01.153 --> 01:09:04.782
It's really wonderful.
They've really taken to each other.

01:09:04.924 --> 01:09:11.261
You know?
She never met her real father.

01:09:11.596 --> 01:09:12.894
No?

01:09:14.099 --> 01:09:18.058
I resigned myself that it's
just going to be me and her.

01:09:21.774 --> 01:09:24.242
I am so grateful
to you and Ray.

01:09:27.613 --> 01:09:29.046
Thank you.

01:09:36.255 --> 01:09:38.120
I know little girl who needs nap.

01:09:38.823 --> 01:09:40.654
I know a little boy who needs a nap.

01:09:40.893 --> 01:09:42.359
Right now, young lady.

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:43.755
Mommy.

01:09:45.130 --> 01:09:46.188
Alright now, be a good girl.

01:09:46.332 --> 01:09:49.563
Oo, my god.
You weigh a million pounds.

01:09:55.674 --> 01:09:57.972
Oh Ray, will you go to market
like you... said?

01:09:58.110 --> 01:09:59.600
The list is on the counter.

01:09:59.712 --> 01:10:00.872
Okay Mommy.

01:10:03.482 --> 01:10:05.313
Well-well-well.

01:10:05.417 --> 01:10:05.849
Yeah.

01:10:05.985 --> 01:10:07.646
Isn't this rich?

01:10:07.786 --> 01:10:09.276
Don't get to liking
it too much, Raymond.

01:10:09.421 --> 01:10:11.286
You never know
when things will change.

01:10:11.557 --> 01:10:13.548
Yeah?
Well maybe I'm ready for a change.

01:10:13.692 --> 01:10:15.717
You Bette Crocker and the brat?

01:10:16.228 --> 01:10:17.286
I can see it all.

01:10:17.429 --> 01:10:19.920
You out there building
a picket fence,

01:10:20.065 --> 01:10:21.999
waving to the folks
in the neighborhood,

01:10:22.134 --> 01:10:23.396
sticking the fucking...

01:10:23.535 --> 01:10:25.594
star on top of the
Christmas tree. Hm?

01:10:26.138 --> 01:10:27.833
That'll be something,
all right.

01:10:28.274 --> 01:10:29.502
Maybe it would.

01:10:32.344 --> 01:10:35.939
You'd be out of your mind inside
a week begging me to come back.

01:10:37.149 --> 01:10:41.483
But, the real problem here,
Raymond...

01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:47.252
the real reason this could never work
is the simple fact that you are no good.

01:10:47.726 --> 01:10:51.025
You are no damn good.

01:10:57.870 --> 01:10:59.929
Don't forget to go to market.

01:11:17.723 --> 01:11:20.055
I'm sorry, but I forgot
to put the cereal in the bag.

01:11:21.093 --> 01:11:22.924
I sure don't want your
little one going hungry.

01:11:23.429 --> 01:11:25.294
I sure appreciate that.

01:11:29.401 --> 01:11:30.663
I like your car.

01:11:52.391 --> 01:11:54.052
What is the matter with you?

01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:05.836
I'm sick like dog.

01:12:06.005 --> 01:12:07.233
Is it the food?

01:12:07.406 --> 01:12:08.634
Oh, no.

01:12:09.208 --> 01:12:10.607
It's me.

01:12:12.011 --> 01:12:15.469
Ten minutes after I get pregnant,
my body lets me know.

01:12:22.855 --> 01:12:27.554
The only thing that makes me feel
better is the cool of the tile.

01:12:28.293 --> 01:12:30.352
Oh, thank god for it.

01:12:31.530 --> 01:12:34.090
I was down for...
two months with Rainelle.

01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:39.670
Don't be angry with us, Martha.

01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:44.971
I wanted... to tell you but Raymond,
he wanted it to be surprise.

01:12:45.978 --> 01:12:47.036
Raymond?

01:12:47.513 --> 01:12:49.276
He wants us
to go out and celebrate,

01:12:49.415 --> 01:12:54.910
but... between you and me,
I'm not up to it.

01:12:55.054 --> 01:12:56.521
I can see that.

01:12:58.190 --> 01:13:02.320
If it's a girl...
we're gonna name her Martha.

01:13:03.362 --> 01:13:05.023
I made him promise.

01:13:10.569 --> 01:13:12.799
Can I tell you something, Martha?

01:13:14.206 --> 01:13:15.434
Tell me.

01:13:16.742 --> 01:13:20.075
I know Raymond isn't exactly
who he say he is, you know.

01:13:21.647 --> 01:13:23.512
He like to tell the stories.

01:13:25.017 --> 01:13:29.716
Doesn't matter to me,
because I have my little girl to raise

01:13:29.855 --> 01:13:32.756
and now I have the new baby.

01:13:33.292 --> 01:13:35.055
I don't want to do it alone.

01:13:37.129 --> 01:13:40.155
Rainelle,
she's crazy about him,

01:13:40.799 --> 01:13:42.824
and... his heart
is in the right place.

01:13:43.035 --> 01:13:44.229
You know?

01:13:45.704 --> 01:13:52.200
I don't... know when it
happened but, I'm in love with him.

01:14:12.097 --> 01:14:13.928
It's gonna be all right.

01:14:19.638 --> 01:14:21.538
It's gonna be all right.

01:14:23.175 --> 01:14:25.370
I'll get you something
for your stomach.

01:14:25.511 --> 01:14:26.409
Oh.

01:14:26.545 --> 01:14:28.035
Remember, I'm a nurse.

01:14:30.883 --> 01:14:32.077
Okay.

01:14:41.693 --> 01:14:42.955
Here.

01:14:45.097 --> 01:14:46.860
This will make you feel better.

01:14:48.534 --> 01:14:51.196
Put your feet up.
Put your feet up.

01:14:53.705 --> 01:14:55.332
I'll get you a pillow.

01:14:56.542 --> 01:14:58.134
Thank you, Martha.

01:15:36.748 --> 01:15:38.340
Mommy!

01:15:39.151 --> 01:15:40.379
Delphine?

01:15:40.519 --> 01:15:43.784
Mommy. I want my mommy!

01:15:44.089 --> 01:15:46.023
Martha?

01:15:50.996 --> 01:15:52.657
Is that for me, baby?

01:15:56.235 --> 01:15:57.600
Delphine?

01:16:01.807 --> 01:16:03.638
You knocked her up.

01:16:04.476 --> 01:16:05.704
Ray.

01:16:06.044 --> 01:16:07.443
Ray.

01:16:10.382 --> 01:16:12.213
What did you do to her?

01:16:12.818 --> 01:16:14.445
The baby.

01:16:14.686 --> 01:16:16.244
What's wrong with her!

01:16:16.388 --> 01:16:17.218
Mommy!

01:16:17.356 --> 01:16:19.790
If you don't love me
then I don't wanna live.

01:16:20.392 --> 01:16:23.759
Do it.
Prove that you don't love me, hm?

01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:27.130
Oh, come on, baby.
You want out.

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:29.958
I'll help you.
We'll do it together.

01:16:30.102 --> 01:16:32.536
Alright?
Just... squeeze it.

01:16:32.671 --> 01:16:33.467
Stop it.

01:16:33.605 --> 01:16:37.166
I don't wanna stay.
Not without you.

01:16:37.309 --> 01:16:39.675
I can't. I can't.

01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:43.743
Who knows you, Raymond?

01:16:44.349 --> 01:16:46.112
Who takes care of you?

01:16:47.486 --> 01:16:48.145
Martha.

01:16:48.287 --> 01:16:50.517
Who... wants you like you are?

01:16:50.656 --> 01:16:52.920
Who's never...
ever gonna leave... you?

01:16:53.091 --> 01:16:56.527
Who do you love, Raymond?
Tell me. Who- who is... it?

01:16:56.662 --> 01:16:58.061
Martha!

01:16:58.196 --> 01:16:59.458
Then show me.

01:17:00.098 --> 01:17:00.530
Show...

01:17:00.666 --> 01:17:03.965
Martha that you love her.
Prove it.

01:17:04.503 --> 01:17:06.130
Prove it... baby.

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:09.468
Oh no, not- not like that.

01:17:09.608 --> 01:17:13.237
If you- if you don't want to hug me...
don't even try it.

01:17:13.378 --> 01:17:14.606
I don't want you
to prove it like that.

01:17:14.746 --> 01:17:16.043
Shoot her.

01:17:18.083 --> 01:17:21.246
Do you love... me?
Do you love me?

01:17:21.653 --> 01:17:23.177
Say you love me!

01:17:23.322 --> 01:17:24.186
Yes!

01:17:24.323 --> 01:17:25.790
Then... do it.

01:17:33.732 --> 01:17:35.666
Do it...
because you love me.

01:17:47.546 --> 01:17:49.514
Mommy!

01:18:29.821 --> 01:18:31.880
Speed limit's thirty miles
an hour back here.

01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:34.353
What's your hurry?

01:18:34.826 --> 01:18:35.986
I don't know.

01:18:36.895 --> 01:18:41.525
Driver's license, please.
What's the lime for?

01:18:42.667 --> 01:18:43.929
Horse died.

01:18:44.202 --> 01:18:45.226
Hm.

01:18:58.984 --> 01:19:00.508
Dispatch Code Three.

01:19:01.186 --> 01:19:02.949
Get back in your vehicle, sir.

01:19:03.822 --> 01:19:05.551
I said get...
back in your truck.

01:19:38.123 --> 01:19:40.751
You have any idea how many
interstate APB's go out in a week?

01:19:42.961 --> 01:19:44.326
I'm leaving.

01:19:45.964 --> 01:19:48.956
All right.
Well, see you later.

01:19:49.534 --> 01:19:50.660
No.

01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:57.067
I'm going to Rochester
to live with my sister.

01:19:58.477 --> 01:20:00.274
Found a job
and everything, so.

01:20:04.483 --> 01:20:05.973
What the
hell you gonna do that for?

01:20:06.618 --> 01:20:08.313
I got nothing keeping me here.

01:20:09.554 --> 01:20:10.578
Buster.

01:20:11.723 --> 01:20:13.987
They're in Michigan.
They killed a cop.

01:20:14.125 --> 01:20:14.853
Did they... get 'em?

01:20:14.993 --> 01:20:16.620
Not yet.
I got us a flight out of Idyllwild.

01:20:16.761 --> 01:20:18.456
We gotta go... right now.
Come on.

01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:23.258
I don't want you to go.

01:20:23.435 --> 01:20:25.062
So stop me.

01:20:46.124 --> 01:20:48.058
I'll be back in a couple days.
Don't go.

01:20:49.127 --> 01:20:50.526
Take care of Eddie.

01:21:28.366 --> 01:21:34.271
Look at that, a brand new tricycle.
How 'bout that, huh?

01:21:36.841 --> 01:21:39.173
Did you wanna look at it?
It's in that box.

01:21:39.878 --> 01:21:41.869
It's beautiful.
Just like you wanted.

01:21:54.225 --> 01:21:56.785
Fellas.
Hunt, Kent County...

01:21:56.895 --> 01:21:58.385
Robinson, Nassau County.

01:21:58.530 --> 01:21:59.724
Tooley, detective squad.

01:21:59.864 --> 01:22:00.922
Charlie.

01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:03.759
You got uh, information on
a case we're investigating.

01:22:03.902 --> 01:22:05.870
Well it's actually our case
we're investigating.

01:22:06.137 --> 01:22:07.968
This is... my sandbox,
Detective.

01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:10.835
Well it's kind of like
a fly shitting on pepper,

01:22:10.976 --> 01:22:12.170
if you catch my drift.

01:22:12.410 --> 01:22:14.970
Maybe you wouldn't mind
explaining something to me.

01:22:15.146 --> 01:22:17.376
- What's that?
- Why didn't you just phone it in?

01:22:18.383 --> 01:22:20.715
When was the last time you lost
an officer in the line?

01:22:20.919 --> 01:22:22.284
This is the first.

01:22:22.954 --> 01:22:24.251
So you don't practice
capital punishment

01:22:24.389 --> 01:22:27.324
here in the uh,
Wolverine State, do ya?

01:22:27.959 --> 01:22:30.052
Look, you help us catch 'em...
we'll invite you up to

01:22:30.195 --> 01:22:32.060
New York for an honest trial

01:22:32.197 --> 01:22:34.563
and a first class
Westinghouse fish fry.

01:22:34.733 --> 01:22:36.166
You got no body.

01:22:36.334 --> 01:22:38.859
No body, no murder.
No murder, no extradition.

01:22:39.170 --> 01:22:40.330
You don't know where they are.

01:22:40.705 --> 01:22:43.435
So, we make a deal
or we let them slip

01:22:43.575 --> 01:22:45.304
into a more
sympathetic commonwealth.

01:22:46.845 --> 01:22:48.745
Well how do we know
you've even got something?

01:22:51.216 --> 01:22:52.444
What's that...
supposed to be?

01:22:52.784 --> 01:22:55.218
A P.O. Box, Grand Rapids.

01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:57.114
We... got a deal?

01:22:58.757 --> 01:22:59.985
Do we have a... deal?

01:23:01.993 --> 01:23:03.858
Yeah, yeah, come on, come on.

01:23:10.301 --> 01:23:11.768
Hey. Hey.

01:23:11.936 --> 01:23:15.565
Stop pouting, you spoiled brat.
Stop pouting.

01:23:15.807 --> 01:23:17.365
How you doing, ol' timer?

01:23:17.742 --> 01:23:18.936
That your dog?

01:23:19.444 --> 01:23:20.502
Yes sir.

01:23:20.645 --> 01:23:23.045
God... damn,
he's an ugly son of a bitch.

01:23:23.181 --> 01:23:24.478
How much you want for him?

01:23:24.983 --> 01:23:26.348
He ain't for sale.

01:23:27.152 --> 01:23:29.017
Everything's for sale.

01:23:30.321 --> 01:23:31.686
A thousand dollars.

01:23:31.823 --> 01:23:32.346
What?

01:23:32.490 --> 01:23:34.014
Take it or leave it.

01:23:35.193 --> 01:23:37.889
A thousand... dollars.

01:23:38.730 --> 01:23:39.719
I'll take it.

01:23:48.406 --> 01:23:49.873
Here's one from our boy.

01:23:50.275 --> 01:23:52.436
My dearest Delphine,
I can't wait to see you.

01:23:53.478 --> 01:23:54.604
There's no date.

01:23:54.879 --> 01:23:56.870
There's only one reason
she wouldn't check her mail.

01:23:59.551 --> 01:24:00.677
He's already here.

01:24:03.354 --> 01:24:06.755
Two-oh-four Adeline Place.
Byron Center.

01:24:23.541 --> 01:24:25.133
Honey, would you like some milk?

01:24:26.444 --> 01:24:27.468
Hm?

01:24:30.582 --> 01:24:34.211
Maybe later, huh? Hm?

01:24:36.087 --> 01:24:39.215
What's the matter?
You don't like your dog?

01:24:39.758 --> 01:24:41.453
He's not my dog.

01:24:43.161 --> 01:24:44.458
Listen.

01:24:45.697 --> 01:24:48.097
You know you're all alone now.

01:24:51.703 --> 01:24:54.103
And I know how that feels.

01:24:55.406 --> 01:24:58.102
It burns on your skin.

01:24:58.243 --> 01:24:59.369
Hm?

01:25:01.379 --> 01:25:07.181
Makes you feel a really bad
pain right on your stomach.

01:25:07.452 --> 01:25:10.444
You can't breathe well.

01:25:10.989 --> 01:25:14.356
You feel
like you're in a dark room

01:25:14.893 --> 01:25:19.489
and that the walls are
coming down on you,

01:25:19.631 --> 01:25:25.934
and that no one
can come and save you.

01:25:27.338 --> 01:25:32.241
I know how you feel, honey.
Do you feel... lonely?

01:25:33.178 --> 01:25:36.477
Hm? Do you feel Ionely?

01:25:37.749 --> 01:25:39.910
You don't have to feel Ionely.

01:25:40.118 --> 01:25:43.451
I'm gonna take
such good care of you, baby.

01:25:46.224 --> 01:25:48.454
I'm gonna be such
a good mommy.

01:25:50.261 --> 01:25:53.253
I'm gonna love you so much.

01:25:57.535 --> 01:26:01.198
But you must love me back.
Understand?

01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:05.734
You must love me back.

01:26:05.877 --> 01:26:07.276
I hate you!

01:26:07.745 --> 01:26:08.507
No you don't.

01:26:08.646 --> 01:26:09.510
I hate you!

01:26:09.647 --> 01:26:10.443
No.

01:28:08.766 --> 01:28:10.028
Ray!

01:28:13.705 --> 01:28:15.036
Don't fire! I got him!

01:28:23.948 --> 01:28:26.041
Get him! Get him!
Son of a bitch!

01:28:26.217 --> 01:28:27.115
No!

01:28:27.285 --> 01:28:29.014
No!

01:28:41.399 --> 01:28:42.627
So where's Mrs. Downing?

01:28:42.767 --> 01:28:43.734
I don't know.

01:28:43.868 --> 01:28:45.460
Where is the little girl?

01:28:48.006 --> 01:28:49.234
I don't know.

01:28:53.878 --> 01:28:55.277
Only four... in the clip.

01:28:56.914 --> 01:28:58.245
Whose gun is this?

01:29:07.992 --> 01:29:10.688
You... got five seconds to tell me
where that fucking little girl is.

01:29:13.598 --> 01:29:14.792
Sweetheart.

01:31:00.404 --> 01:31:03.931
Oh god. Oh god.

01:31:31.536 --> 01:31:34.505
Once we found Delphine Downing...
toes-up in the shed,

01:31:34.872 --> 01:31:36.965
it was no trouble
to find Janette Long.

01:31:37.975 --> 01:31:41.741
She'd been there all along, rotting...
away under the coal chute.

01:31:44.482 --> 01:31:46.746
But the Kent County prosecutor
wasn't giving up the biggest...

01:31:46.884 --> 01:31:49.216
pinch since Bugs Moran
without a confession.

01:31:50.254 --> 01:31:51.585
So we sweated 'em.

01:31:53.424 --> 01:31:55.517
The truth is, though,
animals like that,

01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:59.562
they can't wait to tell you
their story, while it was ripe.

01:32:04.569 --> 01:32:05.934
Want a donut?

01:32:08.239 --> 01:32:10.503
You know what they say
about cops and donuts?

01:32:10.908 --> 01:32:11.897
No, what?

01:32:13.311 --> 01:32:15.506
Neither one is
any good without a hole in them.

01:32:17.215 --> 01:32:18.705
They say that
about women, too.

01:32:28.693 --> 01:32:30.183
It's good to see you have a sense
of humor considering

01:32:30.328 --> 01:32:31.955
what you got ahead of you.

01:32:32.430 --> 01:32:36.332
Room and board for
the next fifty, sixty years?

01:32:37.468 --> 01:32:38.992
Be worse
if you had it your way.

01:32:40.304 --> 01:32:41.396
That's true.

01:32:41.505 --> 01:32:43.166
I know who you are.

01:32:44.275 --> 01:32:45.435
You do?

01:32:51.482 --> 01:32:52.676
That's good.

01:32:56.387 --> 01:32:57.411
Tell you what.

01:32:57.822 --> 01:32:59.449
Let's don't...
bullshit each other, huh?

01:32:59.624 --> 01:33:00.648
Fine.

01:33:01.659 --> 01:33:03.024
I'm not gonna ask you much.

01:33:03.227 --> 01:33:05.422
I'm not gonna ask you about
the pretty girl in the bathtub.

01:33:05.630 --> 01:33:07.393
I'm not gonna
ask you about the uh,

01:33:07.531 --> 01:33:10.329
three dozen women that you
fleeced across the country.

01:33:10.468 --> 01:33:14.165
I'm not even gonna ask you
to tell me where Janette Long's body is.

01:33:14.772 --> 01:33:16.137
But I am gonna ask you what...

01:33:16.274 --> 01:33:20.938
happened, because there's a young lady
and three kids that need to know,

01:33:21.078 --> 01:33:24.047
'cause they wanna understand
so they can move on with their lives.

01:33:24.248 --> 01:33:27.149
You'd just love it
to be that simple, wouldn't you?

01:33:27.718 --> 01:33:31.916
Put it in a little box,
explain what you can't.

01:33:32.056 --> 01:33:33.887
Like you did
with that little girl, huh?

01:33:34.025 --> 01:33:37.620
What? That's what you're
all about too, isn't it?

01:33:38.362 --> 01:33:42.662
Making things, people,
just go away?

01:33:44.935 --> 01:33:49.463
You can't just throw things away.
What you did to people.

01:33:50.541 --> 01:33:55.706
It's always there, out there,
waiting for you in the dark.

01:33:55.846 --> 01:33:57.074
Sure enough.

01:33:58.015 --> 01:34:03.078
The thing is, though,
you'd just as soon see me burn...

01:34:03.688 --> 01:34:05.246
so you can go home...

01:34:05.489 --> 01:34:07.719
to your little house,
your little wife,

01:34:07.858 --> 01:34:11.316
your little life,
and pound your chest like a monkey.

01:34:11.462 --> 01:34:12.759
Huh?

01:34:15.166 --> 01:34:19.967
I take some amusement in denying you
and your donuts that pleasure.

01:34:22.406 --> 01:34:23.304
Ms. Beck.

01:34:23.441 --> 01:34:25.739
- You can call me Martha, honey.
- Martha.

01:34:27.078 --> 01:34:32.516
My life is a never-ending
sewer of maggots like you.

01:34:34.618 --> 01:34:36.984
You're gonna grow old
and die in a concrete box

01:34:37.121 --> 01:34:39.681
with bars at one end
and a shitter at the other.

01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:42.220
In a couple of years
I won't even remember your name.

01:34:42.393 --> 01:34:46.591
Just gonna be a case
file stamped, Closed.

01:34:48.432 --> 01:34:51.765
But you got an opportunity...
to help somebody.

01:34:52.570 --> 01:34:55.334
It's not much, really...
considering what you did.

01:34:56.374 --> 01:34:59.275
It would be the one...
decent thing that you do

01:34:59.410 --> 01:35:02.140
in what's left of your sad
and pathetic life.

01:35:11.889 --> 01:35:16.917
We did it with a hammer.
Ray, he strangled her.

01:35:17.862 --> 01:35:19.261
He didn't do any more than I did.

01:35:19.397 --> 01:35:20.887
I'm not trying
to pass that off on him.

01:35:21.031 --> 01:35:22.328
We both did it.

01:35:25.002 --> 01:35:27.903
It's just that one
bitch wouldn't die.

01:35:30.007 --> 01:35:31.235
That's all.

01:35:33.043 --> 01:35:34.203
That's all.

01:35:38.716 --> 01:35:40.206
We hauled 'em back to New York.

01:35:40.718 --> 01:35:43.346
The trial lasted forty-four days.

01:35:44.021 --> 01:35:46.888
They were charged with three
murders and tied to twenty more.

01:35:47.625 --> 01:35:50.253
But it only took
Janette Long to get 'em the juice.

01:36:11.849 --> 01:36:13.111
Looks nice.

01:36:16.053 --> 01:36:19.545
You know, I built it for her.
Well, for both of you.

01:36:20.224 --> 01:36:21.657
She would've liked that.

01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:24.318
I wished I had told her.

01:36:25.029 --> 01:36:26.496
You told me.

01:36:27.665 --> 01:36:29.599
You know, I don't know
why she left us, Eddie.

01:36:30.601 --> 01:36:37.029
I mean I, I could understand
why she'd leave me but, you, no.

01:36:38.876 --> 01:36:40.275
It wasn't your fault.

01:36:41.145 --> 01:36:42.669
It wasn't your fault, either.

01:36:51.055 --> 01:36:52.249
You know where I'm going?

01:36:52.389 --> 01:36:53.583
Yeah.

01:36:54.024 --> 01:36:55.651
You know how to rig...
the trailer hitch?

01:36:56.827 --> 01:36:57.919
Yeah.

01:36:58.028 --> 01:36:59.791
Why don't ya pick me up afterwards.

01:37:09.673 --> 01:37:11.038
Careful with the fender.

01:38:09.533 --> 01:38:11.330
Okay. Okay.

01:38:11.468 --> 01:38:12.833
You wanna know why?

01:38:13.938 --> 01:38:15.838
You wanna know why we did it?

01:38:16.006 --> 01:38:19.533
Okay Martha, why?
Why'd you do it?

01:38:20.978 --> 01:38:26.712
Because Raymond is mine.
He belongs to me.

01:38:33.591 --> 01:38:35.388
God, he's a lover.

01:38:36.894 --> 01:38:38.555
So... romantic.

01:38:39.964 --> 01:38:42.125
I'm the only one for him.

01:38:43.067 --> 01:38:44.898
Nothing comes between us.

01:38:47.071 --> 01:38:48.163
No one.

01:38:48.806 --> 01:38:50.330
Raymond Martinez Fernandez,

01:38:50.474 --> 01:38:52.305
you've been duly convicted
and sentenced to death to...

01:38:52.443 --> 01:38:53.842
be carried out forthwith.

01:38:54.612 --> 01:38:56.136
Do you have anything...
to say?

01:39:01.752 --> 01:39:03.185
Oh god.

01:39:04.421 --> 01:39:05.581
Oh my god.

01:39:06.056 --> 01:39:10.823
He kills... for me.
That's how much he loves me.

01:39:14.064 --> 01:39:16.532
What else would anybody kill...
or die for?

01:39:19.336 --> 01:39:19.893
Has anybody...

01:39:20.037 --> 01:39:22.665
ever loved you that much,
Detective?

01:39:23.741 --> 01:39:26.073
To kill or die for you?

01:40:04.181 --> 01:40:09.209
I can smell him.
So sweet.

01:40:10.788 --> 01:40:12.085
Martha Jule Beck,

01:40:12.289 --> 01:40:13.847
you've been duly
convicted and sentenced...

01:40:13.991 --> 01:40:15.652
to death to be
carried out forthwith.

01:40:15.793 --> 01:40:17.226
Do you have anything to say?

01:40:25.936 --> 01:40:27.335
So long.

01:40:53.497 --> 01:40:54.987
You don't look so good.

01:40:58.168 --> 01:40:59.465
I'm all right.

01:40:59.770 --> 01:41:00.998
You sure?

01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:04.368
An eye for an eye... right?

01:41:05.442 --> 01:41:06.306
Yeah.

01:41:06.443 --> 01:41:07.603
Yeah.

01:41:08.545 --> 01:41:10.809
They don't have enough
eyes and teeth

01:41:10.948 --> 01:41:13.576
between 'em to pay for
what they did, though.

01:41:16.286 --> 01:41:19.483
Some- some god damn
fish fry, huh?

01:41:22.559 --> 01:41:24.959
Like MacSwain said,
this is a good one.

01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:30.830
I don't know, Charlie.
It don't feel that good to me.

01:41:33.704 --> 01:41:35.296
Yeah, well
I know why they're in there.

01:41:35.639 --> 01:41:38.733
I know why.
We just did our job.

01:41:40.110 --> 01:41:41.407
We did.

01:41:55.125 --> 01:41:57.616
For a long time I didn't understand
what he did that day.

01:41:58.362 --> 01:42:00.830
I figured he tossed a gold
shield career into the shitter.

01:42:05.435 --> 01:42:07.926
But it started to hit me
what the job had become for Buster.

01:42:10.107 --> 01:42:11.233
And for me, too.

01:42:15.012 --> 01:42:16.138
Buster left his...
regrets and what didn't work

01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:19.147
no more in the
Sing Sing Death House.

01:42:19.650 --> 01:42:24.280
He pushed up river for better days.
And he never looked back.

01:42:25.305 --> 01:42:31.477
