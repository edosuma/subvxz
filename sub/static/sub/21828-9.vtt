WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.875
(Ryan) Previously, on Mech-X4...

00:04.959 --> 00:06.792
I could've won this battle
if I had two good arms.

00:06.875 --> 00:07.792
But I know what we can do.

00:07.875 --> 00:10.041
-Do it.
-Who are you talking to?

00:10.125 --> 00:11.625
(boom)

00:12.792 --> 00:15.667
-Welcome to Mech-X4.
-No way.

00:33.875 --> 00:36.875
Okay, weapons... ugh.

00:38.083 --> 00:39.000
Huh.

00:40.250 --> 00:41.458
Sticky.

00:44.458 --> 00:45.875
(sigh)

00:48.792 --> 00:51.333
Scanners. Shields.

00:51.417 --> 00:52.709
Scanners and shields.

01:02.458 --> 01:04.083
This is amazing.

01:12.625 --> 01:13.542
-Excuse me.
-Jeez.

01:13.625 --> 01:14.750
That's my spot.

01:15.375 --> 01:18.333
-How long you been up there?
-Since you said "sticky."

01:19.875 --> 01:21.750
It's pretty cool, isn't it?

01:21.834 --> 01:25.083
Yeah, uh, except for the hallway
that smells like bratwurst.

01:25.792 --> 01:28.917
Dang it, I told Spyder to stop
using the legs as a smokehouse.

01:30.542 --> 01:33.667
So, it's been a few days
since we asked you to join.

01:33.750 --> 01:35.500
You still haven't told us that you're in.

01:40.458 --> 01:42.792
By the way, you still
haven't told us that you're in.

01:42.875 --> 01:44.792
Oh, yeah. Oh, no, no, I'm-I'm in.

01:44.875 --> 01:46.417
Giant monster-fighting robot?

01:46.500 --> 01:47.542
Ah, you know it.

01:47.625 --> 01:49.458
I will handle defense
until Harris gets back.

01:49.542 --> 01:50.583
Then bump it!

01:51.208 --> 01:53.291
Uh...

01:53.375 --> 01:58.041
Um, I'm really psyched to be here,
but I'm not really the bump-it type.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.959
So... what's on deck?

02:02.959 --> 02:06.625
Getting ready to fight something
way worse than Seth Harper.

02:07.917 --> 02:12.542
(theme music playing)

02:42.375 --> 02:44.417
(growling)

02:48.709 --> 02:51.166
Guys! Guys!
We're getting our butts handed to us!

02:51.250 --> 02:53.625
Okay, note to self,
wash hands after battle.

02:53.709 --> 02:56.750
We're losing the ventral armor.
I gotta go secure it.

02:58.625 --> 03:00.208
Harris! Harris, shields!

03:00.291 --> 03:02.417
I've got you covered, Desmond.

03:02.500 --> 03:03.375
Desmond?

03:03.458 --> 03:06.208
Well, I've been calling you Ryan
for what, 13 years now?

03:06.291 --> 03:07.417
Why did you not say something?

03:07.500 --> 03:09.959
Sorry, sorry, Veracity, habit.

03:10.041 --> 03:11.041
Yup.

03:14.917 --> 03:17.667
Okay, Spyder, arm cannon,
and then I'll follow up with...

03:17.750 --> 03:19.291
(boom)

03:19.875 --> 03:21.333
The robot won't respond.

03:21.417 --> 03:23.083
My panel's dead, too.

03:23.750 --> 03:26.792
(roaring)

03:26.875 --> 03:28.834
(Harris) Bam. Simulation over.

03:28.917 --> 03:32.375
Bam. Welcome to Scraptown, y'all. Yo.

03:32.458 --> 03:33.959
Well, that stunk.

03:34.041 --> 03:36.917
At least Harris' simulation program
worked okay.

03:39.583 --> 03:42.041
Anybody else get an animated Harris
mocking them on their Mech-Link?

03:42.125 --> 03:44.208
Since he's been injured,
he's had a lot of free time.

03:44.291 --> 03:46.208
I don't get it.
How did we lose power?

03:46.291 --> 03:47.834
Uh, yeah, I think this is on me.

03:47.917 --> 03:51.375
I figured out how to extend the shields,
and keep the monster further away.

03:51.458 --> 03:53.583
Seems like a great idea to me, yeah.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.750
Which is our first clue
that it was a bad idea.

03:55.834 --> 03:59.750
Well, I mean, I needed the extra power
to extend the shields, and I guess

03:59.834 --> 04:01.750
it took it from your systems. My bad.

04:01.834 --> 04:03.417
It was a great idea,

04:03.500 --> 04:06.208
but you have to tell us
so we can work as a team.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
-I was just tryin' to win.
-We were all trying to win.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.458
These simulations
are to help you learn to work with us,

04:12.542 --> 04:13.667
but you've gotta work with us.

04:13.750 --> 04:15.834
Hey, she gets it. She gets it, Ry.

04:16.959 --> 04:19.417
Hey, guys, how'd the simulation go?

04:19.500 --> 04:23.041
Well, spectacular.
She was great, uh...

04:23.125 --> 04:25.792
I mean, of course, you're great, too.
It's still your chair.

04:25.875 --> 04:27.834
It's, uh... You're just injured.

04:29.125 --> 04:32.667
So, do I know how
to defuse a situation or what?

04:32.750 --> 04:34.542
I found the plane Grey
and Traeger stole.

04:34.625 --> 04:36.333
They're way up in the Arctic.

04:36.417 --> 04:38.917
The Arctic. That's way too far
for us to rocket jump.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.458
We need Leo's flight mode.

04:40.542 --> 04:44.250
So, Mark and I will have to finish
the flight upgrade during our free period.

04:44.333 --> 04:46.500
All right, great training session,
everyone.

04:46.583 --> 04:48.125
See y'all at school.

04:49.417 --> 04:51.417
When Ryan said
"Great training session everyone."

04:51.500 --> 04:53.542
-Sarcasm. Yup.
-Figured.

04:58.917 --> 05:02.709
Hey... ya know you really messed up
with Veracity back there?

05:02.792 --> 05:06.625
Dude, we have to get her ready for battle.
If she's not up to speed, we could lose.

05:06.709 --> 05:08.208
Ryan, she barely knows you.

05:08.291 --> 05:10.333
Okay, we follow you
because we've known you forever.

05:10.417 --> 05:11.959
Okay, so what are you suggesting?

05:12.041 --> 05:13.333
Camp out in the robot?

05:13.417 --> 05:15.709
We can watch scary movies?
We can make s'mores?

05:15.792 --> 05:17.500
The s'mores would actually be great.

05:17.583 --> 05:20.667
Yeah, they would but, no,
that's not what I'm saying.

05:21.583 --> 05:24.166
When Dad was in the Army,
he wasn't best buds with his commanders.

05:24.250 --> 05:26.917
But they inspired him.
That's why he followed them.

05:27.709 --> 05:30.000
That's what you need to do with Veracity.

05:31.375 --> 05:32.250
Inspire her?

05:33.250 --> 05:34.333
How do I do that?

05:34.417 --> 05:37.000
Part of being a leader
is figuring out how, bro.

05:41.166 --> 05:42.834
(school bell ringing)

05:45.250 --> 05:46.542
Yo, Sup V?

05:46.625 --> 05:48.500
(all) Shh!

05:48.583 --> 05:50.041
Dude, be quiet.

05:50.125 --> 05:52.041
Sorry. Sorry, what...

05:52.125 --> 05:55.917
What, uh...
what are these people doin' here?

05:56.000 --> 05:57.583
Is this some sort of kid prison?

05:57.667 --> 05:59.625
Spyder, go away.

05:59.709 --> 06:00.583
No.

06:00.667 --> 06:04.000
I'm reading Harris'
stupid tutorial again. Uh...

06:04.792 --> 06:06.542
Reading, no.

06:06.625 --> 06:09.208
I came here to tell you
that you're doing fine.

06:12.333 --> 06:13.417
Look...

06:14.208 --> 06:18.125
I can memorize every ridiculous detail
in that stupid tutorial,

06:18.208 --> 06:19.917
but that's gonna solve
the real problem.

06:20.000 --> 06:20.959
Right.

06:21.750 --> 06:22.792
Which is...?

06:22.875 --> 06:24.542
I'm used to working alone.

06:25.125 --> 06:27.750
The whole others relying on me
and me relying on others thing,

06:27.834 --> 06:30.625
just... just kinda weirds me out.

06:31.458 --> 06:37.125
I actually don't have
a lot of friends or anything.

06:40.125 --> 06:42.208
You know what's cool about the robot?

06:42.291 --> 06:46.000
It's that it made all of us
teammates, and friends.

06:46.834 --> 06:50.458
Mark and I didn't get along,
and now we're like, super buds.

06:50.542 --> 06:52.333
(Mark) Angus! Hey, Smelly!

06:52.417 --> 06:55.000
Me and Nerdo are ready
to test flight mode. Peace, Buttface.

06:55.083 --> 06:57.000
N-no problem, best buddy!

06:57.083 --> 06:59.125
(students) Shh!

06:59.208 --> 07:00.583
I hate kid prison.

07:02.792 --> 07:05.333
-I will not be silenced!
-Shh!

07:05.417 --> 07:06.500
Yeah!

07:19.625 --> 07:23.458
(jet sounds)

07:25.750 --> 07:26.917
Locked in!

07:27.000 --> 07:28.750
Ah!

07:30.166 --> 07:32.583
I can feel the jet
integrating with the robot.

07:33.417 --> 07:35.792
All right! Let's fly!

07:45.375 --> 07:46.250
Woo!

07:50.625 --> 07:51.834
Flying is awesome!

07:51.917 --> 07:54.750
Duh, bro, that's why birds
are always singing.

07:55.458 --> 07:57.166
Woooo!

08:02.375 --> 08:03.291
(laughs)

08:09.709 --> 08:11.125
Woo-hoo!

08:15.625 --> 08:16.583
Hooo!

08:16.667 --> 08:18.542
Dude, faster, spin faster!

08:18.625 --> 08:21.750
Or... slower. In a straight line, please.

08:24.750 --> 08:27.000
(explosion)

08:30.458 --> 08:32.834
Aah! Aah! What the heck?

08:33.709 --> 08:36.583
Whoa, uh, reading
some kind of e-explosion?

08:36.667 --> 08:39.417
Obviously. Damage reports coming in.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.208
Shut the jet down,
take us back to the hangar.

08:41.291 --> 08:42.375
This test was a failure.

08:46.583 --> 08:48.417
It's not going down, I can't stop it.

08:56.917 --> 08:58.709
Aah!

08:58.792 --> 08:59.750
Bro, you okay?

08:59.834 --> 09:01.083
Yeah, I'm just trying not to crash.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.834
I still can't turn off the jet's engines.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.583
The jet's turbines
are combustion engines.

09:04.667 --> 09:07.000
It's a chemical reaction.
You can't turn it off with your power.

09:07.083 --> 09:09.083
Mountain! Mountain!

09:15.834 --> 09:16.959
Nice move!

09:17.041 --> 09:18.667
Harris, can you detach the jet?

09:18.750 --> 09:20.875
No. The explosion fried everything.

09:22.041 --> 09:25.458
And also, did you know
Spyder has a third nipple?

09:25.542 --> 09:28.667
-What?
-That was a pillow fort secret!

09:28.750 --> 09:31.625
That you gave away there, ha, ha.

09:31.709 --> 09:33.417
The carbon monoxide
is filling up the cockpit.

09:33.500 --> 09:34.500
That's why he's so loopy.

09:34.583 --> 09:36.125
And the hatch is sealed.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.458
All right, let's save the day!

09:38.542 --> 09:39.542
Mark, bust him out.

09:39.625 --> 09:41.667
I'm gonna fly over the ocean
where we can't hit anything.

09:41.750 --> 09:42.959
On it.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.000
-(boom)
-Aaah!

09:45.083 --> 09:46.208
Aah! Aah!

09:46.291 --> 09:47.959
Dude, what's wrong now?

09:48.041 --> 09:51.166
I don't know how to say it,
so... I'm just gonna say it.

09:51.250 --> 09:52.709
My butt's on fire.

09:52.792 --> 09:55.834
Uh, yup, there is a fire
in the anterior syndromic system.

09:58.208 --> 09:59.375
The robot's butt.

10:00.125 --> 10:01.959
You guys need to put it out.

10:02.041 --> 10:04.500
Also, I have a burn cream
for that, if you'd like.

10:04.583 --> 10:05.417
Go!

10:10.291 --> 10:11.875
I'll have you out of there in a sec!

10:11.959 --> 10:14.917
(Harrie) Listen, Mark, if I don't make it,

10:15.000 --> 10:17.667
there's something important
you need to know.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.083
What is it?

10:19.166 --> 10:20.625
Me and Spyder are the ones

10:20.709 --> 10:22.792
who ruined your date
with Casey Weintraub.

10:22.875 --> 10:24.792
You were the ones
that put glue on my car seat?

10:24.875 --> 10:28.041
(gasp) Oh, she was so mad
in the video!

10:28.125 --> 10:29.250
What video?

10:29.333 --> 10:30.375
Never mind.

10:31.417 --> 10:33.333
(grunts) I can't get this thing open.

10:33.417 --> 10:35.750
I'm gonna try to teleport through.

10:42.792 --> 10:44.208
It didn't work!

10:45.000 --> 10:47.083
Curse you, physics!

10:47.166 --> 10:48.750
Look, I know you're hopped up
on goofy gas,

10:48.834 --> 10:50.166
but I need you
to cowboy up right now.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.417
How do I get you outta here?

10:51.500 --> 10:55.041
The only way would be
to blow the hatch off with a bomb.

10:55.709 --> 10:56.875
I'll be right back!

10:59.291 --> 11:01.250
Wow, you are fast like a cheetah!

11:01.333 --> 11:03.667
No offense, comic relief,
but I can handle this by myself.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.625
No, that's not how we work, okay,
I know every inch of this robot.

11:06.709 --> 11:09.667
You need me.
Also, what are we doing?

11:09.750 --> 11:11.834
The robot has a built-in
fire suppression system,

11:11.917 --> 11:13.667
but for some reason,
it's not activating right now.

11:13.750 --> 11:16.041
But, around this corner
is a panel that's gonna let me...

11:16.125 --> 11:19.083
-Toast marshmallows.
-Oh...

11:19.166 --> 11:22.000
-(sparks)
-Okay. Okay, that's just an obstacle.

11:22.083 --> 11:25.083
Uh, life only gives us
obstacles, so think.

11:25.166 --> 11:27.750
-About what?
-(sigh) So many obstacles.

11:27.834 --> 11:29.792
-(sparks)
-Oh, okay, uh...

11:29.875 --> 11:32.542
There are junction boxes
in the ventilation systems,

11:32.625 --> 11:35.208
and we can activate the fire
suppression system from there, yes.

11:35.291 --> 11:37.583
But it's like a maze in there,
so I'm not gonna know where to go.

11:37.667 --> 11:40.583
Well, I got the blueprints here,
I-I can...

11:40.667 --> 11:42.709
Wait... There we go.
I-I can direct you.

11:43.542 --> 11:45.667
Uh, is there someone else
who can do this?

11:45.750 --> 11:48.542
Maybe Ryan, or like,
that water skiing squirrel?

11:48.625 --> 11:53.166
Oh, man, I wish, but, no,
just... trust your teammate.

11:57.583 --> 11:58.583
Okay.

11:58.667 --> 12:00.166
Okay. Okay.

12:00.250 --> 12:02.792
(grunts)

12:08.667 --> 12:12.458
Yo, Ryan. I can't get to the armory.
There's a fire.

12:12.542 --> 12:15.291
(Ryan) Veracity and Spyder are on it.
Just hang on.

12:15.375 --> 12:16.750
Whoa!

12:20.583 --> 12:23.500
Okay, um... make a right.

12:23.583 --> 12:25.458
(Spyder) No, no! Left.

12:25.542 --> 12:28.417
-No.
-Spyder? Focus.

12:28.500 --> 12:31.375
Okay... make a left.

12:31.458 --> 12:33.458
Then the next right,
then the next left,

12:33.542 --> 12:35.375
and you're golden. Trust me.

12:36.458 --> 12:37.750
Ah, there we go.

12:47.959 --> 12:49.625
Is there a fire in the vents, too?

12:49.709 --> 12:51.250
Plenty of time before it gets to you.

12:51.333 --> 12:52.458
Are you sure?

12:52.542 --> 12:55.083
Oh, I know fire,
I destroy a lot of evidence.

12:56.041 --> 12:57.542
Okay.

13:04.166 --> 13:05.583
I got it! I got it!

13:08.166 --> 13:10.542
I can feel the fires going out
all over the bot.

13:10.625 --> 13:11.625
My butt thanks you.

13:11.709 --> 13:13.667
And my butt says you're welcome.

13:13.750 --> 13:15.959
All right, we're out over the ocean.
I'm just doin' donuts.

13:16.041 --> 13:18.458
Spyder, Veracity,
get back to the control center.

13:18.542 --> 13:20.291
Mark, get Harris out of the jet.

13:20.375 --> 13:23.667
Uh, more fire.
You can get outta there, now, V.

13:24.458 --> 13:27.834
The fire suppression is taking
its time coming into the vent systems,

13:27.917 --> 13:29.917
and the fire's coming at me really fast.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
(fiery bursts)

13:32.083 --> 13:33.250
(screams)

13:33.333 --> 13:34.625
I got you, V.

13:34.709 --> 13:37.166
Ryan, I need an incline
as steep as you can.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.041
I'll do the best I can.

13:42.834 --> 13:46.125
(screaming)

13:48.250 --> 13:49.542
(screaming)

13:49.625 --> 13:51.250
-Veracity!
-(thud)

13:55.917 --> 13:57.208
(coughs)

13:58.375 --> 13:59.583
You guys saved me.

14:00.375 --> 14:05.041
And you saved us, so...
thanks, and you're welcome.

14:06.083 --> 14:07.667
Thanks and you're welcome.

14:07.750 --> 14:09.542
Thank you and you're welcome.

14:09.625 --> 14:11.625
Thank you and you're welcome.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.458
I'm not used to this.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.208
Okay. I'm gonna blow the hatch.

14:20.291 --> 14:22.959
(Mark) Let's get your little wee butt
outta there.

14:23.834 --> 14:28.291
(beeping)

14:28.375 --> 14:30.458
(explosion)

14:40.417 --> 14:43.333
All right, buddy.
We're gonna get you outta here.

14:45.208 --> 14:46.959
So, I've got Nerdo.

14:47.041 --> 14:48.583
And the fire is out.

14:48.667 --> 14:51.542
And we're right over the ocean.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.333
We just need to figure out
a way to stop.

14:53.417 --> 14:55.709
I mean, what could possibly go wrong?

14:55.792 --> 14:57.125
(loud bang)

14:59.041 --> 15:03.458
(engines roaring)

15:05.834 --> 15:07.500
I can't steer anymore!

15:07.583 --> 15:09.041
That. That's what
could possibly go wrong.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.917
Uh, the fire destroyed
the controls for the rudder.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.417
It'll take hours to fix.

15:12.500 --> 15:14.709
We don't have hours.
We're rocketing back toward Bay City.

15:14.792 --> 15:16.959
(Veracity) Well, if we crash
into the city at this speed,

15:17.041 --> 15:19.792
we will turn it into a crater.

15:24.792 --> 15:28.542
It's no use. The jump rockets
aren't strong enough to change our course.

15:28.625 --> 15:33.083
There's only one more option...
eject and blow up Mech-X4.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.875
You mean use the self-destruct?

15:34.959 --> 15:37.583
If anybody has a better idea,
I'm listening.

15:38.500 --> 15:41.834
Harris... do you remember,
in, uh, in fifth grade,

15:41.917 --> 15:43.542
when you were too afraid
to take me down

15:43.625 --> 15:45.583
in that mathletics showdown?

15:45.667 --> 15:47.834
For the bazillionth time, I wasn't afraid.

15:47.917 --> 15:52.000
My parents' car really...
did... run out of gas.

15:52.083 --> 15:54.583
Hey, yeah! Without gas,
the engines will stop.

15:54.667 --> 15:57.000
We'll never run out of gas
before we hit the city.

15:57.083 --> 16:00.709
But according to Harris'
absurdly detailed tutorial,

16:00.792 --> 16:02.834
we can just dump fuel manually,
we have to go outside,

16:02.917 --> 16:04.583
and not fall to our deaths.

16:04.667 --> 16:06.417
It's too dangerous
at the speed we're moving at.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.458
The wind will blow you right off.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.875
If only we could, like, uh,
stay still for a few minutes.

16:12.959 --> 16:14.083
The grappling grip!

16:14.166 --> 16:17.458
We can grab something on the ground,
and it'll hold the robot like an anchor!

16:17.542 --> 16:19.250
That could give us the time
to dump the fuel.

16:19.333 --> 16:22.166
I could dump the fuel, but...
there are two engines.

16:23.375 --> 16:24.959
We need another person to take the trip.

16:25.041 --> 16:28.000
Harris can't.
And Spyder's firing the grappling grip,

16:28.083 --> 16:29.542
and I have to pilot the robot.

16:29.625 --> 16:31.041
I got it.

16:31.709 --> 16:33.375
It's gonna be rough out there.

16:33.458 --> 16:35.542
No, I know. I can do it.

16:38.333 --> 16:39.917
Come on, Desmond.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.667
Bump it.

16:44.917 --> 16:46.375
You guys dump the fuel.

16:46.458 --> 16:48.834
We'll find us something to slow us down.

16:50.458 --> 16:52.166
There are gravity pucks
in these shoes.

16:52.250 --> 16:54.125
They'll keep you attached
to the robot's hull.

16:54.208 --> 16:56.875
If they don't, at least I die
in a pair of nice new shoes.

16:56.959 --> 16:59.125
-Now you're gettin' it.
-Hm.

16:59.208 --> 17:01.333
So, would Ryan really
blow up the robot to save the city?

17:01.417 --> 17:03.250
Totally.

17:03.333 --> 17:05.166
Other kids freak
if their apps don't update.

17:05.250 --> 17:07.166
How could he
give all of this up, it's just...

17:07.250 --> 17:09.834
Inspiring? Like a good leader?

17:11.792 --> 17:12.917
I told him to do that.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.208
Look at you. Brother of the year.

17:14.291 --> 17:16.208
Huh... Let's go.

17:16.291 --> 17:17.375
(Veracity laughs)

17:35.333 --> 17:39.000
You take this fuel tank.
I'm gonna take the one on the far side.

17:39.083 --> 17:40.291
Okay.

17:47.500 --> 17:52.166
(wind howling)

17:54.458 --> 17:55.542
(Ryan) Mark, how's it going?

17:55.625 --> 17:57.500
Dumping the fuel now.

18:00.959 --> 18:04.834
(howling wind continues)

18:08.834 --> 18:10.667
(laughs) Yeah!

18:15.875 --> 18:17.834
(laughs)

18:17.917 --> 18:20.792
(Veracity) I'm emptying the second tank!

18:20.875 --> 18:23.792
(Harris) We're losing fuel and speed!
It's working!

18:25.083 --> 18:27.041
-(crashing sound)
-Aah... Aah... Aah!

18:27.125 --> 18:28.542
Ohh!

18:39.542 --> 18:41.208
Aah! Ahhh!

18:42.083 --> 18:44.542
(screams)

18:44.625 --> 18:46.291
Aah! Ohh!

18:47.792 --> 18:49.875
(Harris) We're still coming in too fast!

18:49.959 --> 18:52.875
(Ryan) Spyder, grappling grip!
We gotta slow down now!

19:02.542 --> 19:05.375
(grunts) All right, we snagged something.

19:05.458 --> 19:06.458
And it's holding!

19:07.959 --> 19:09.875
The grip is barely hanging on!

19:09.959 --> 19:12.458
My arm feels like it's being
torn out of the socket!

19:12.542 --> 19:15.041
Keep holding,
the freighter's anchored.

19:16.792 --> 19:18.333
(grunts)

19:18.417 --> 19:20.083
(Harris) We're moving again!

19:22.333 --> 19:23.792
Dude, where's Veracity?

19:24.834 --> 19:26.166
She didn't come back?

19:27.625 --> 19:31.500
Grab the gravity pucks,
we all have to go out there and find her.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.375
(Ryan) Veracity! You're okay!

19:37.458 --> 19:38.625
Found her.

19:39.750 --> 19:41.291
I knocked Harris' tutorial,

19:41.375 --> 19:43.500
but it did have an annoyingly
detailed section

19:43.583 --> 19:45.583
on how to amp up
your gravity shoes.

19:45.667 --> 19:48.291
You didn't think I was gonna let you
croak me on our first mission, right?

19:48.375 --> 19:49.250
(beeps)

19:49.333 --> 19:54.542
Oh, and uh, we will be
out of fuel in three, two...

19:54.625 --> 19:55.792
and one.

19:59.125 --> 20:00.917
(Veracity) So, we're gliding.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.542
Shouldn't you be back
in your flight girdle?

20:02.625 --> 20:05.291
Okay, but we're definitely coming up
with a cooler name for this thing.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.250
(boom)

20:19.458 --> 20:21.125
(Harris) Found the source
of the explosion.

20:21.208 --> 20:23.417
Leo had to build the jet
from whatever tech he could find,

20:23.500 --> 20:25.583
so some of the fuel lines
weren't secure enough.

20:25.667 --> 20:27.875
Some of the gas leaked
into the thrusters and ignited.

20:27.959 --> 20:28.959
We've replaced all of them.

20:29.041 --> 20:31.750
We could take the fight to Traeger
as soon as the repair cycle's over.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.375
In a day or so.

20:35.458 --> 20:38.417
Hey! The new 4D movie
opened at the Metro-Plex,

20:38.500 --> 20:40.875
uh, you can practically
smell Chris Pratt's handsomeness.

20:42.792 --> 20:46.625
Okay, well... just bought tickets.

20:46.709 --> 20:48.709
-I'll save the seats.
-I'm on snack patrol.

20:48.792 --> 20:51.792
And I'll point out the plot holes.
Yeah, there's a lot of them.

21:00.458 --> 21:02.625
Hey. Aren't you comin'?

21:04.250 --> 21:05.333
Yeah.

21:05.875 --> 21:09.083
Um... yeah, I'll shush
people that can't shut up.

21:09.166 --> 21:12.166
Awesome, because Spyder
loves to yell at the screen.

21:17.125 --> 21:18.500
(sighs)

21:18.583 --> 21:20.458
(laughs)

21:30.667 --> 21:32.417
Everything is ready.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.959
Mech-X4 is still out there.

21:35.041 --> 21:36.750
They always figure out a way to win.

21:36.834 --> 21:42.125
I know. But now... we have this.

22:02.792 --> 22:09.083
(theme music playing)

22:28.834 --> 22:30.250
(barks)
