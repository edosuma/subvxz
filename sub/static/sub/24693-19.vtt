SHE'LL NEVER DO IT.
NEVER.

00:18.785 --> 00:21.253
SHE TOTALLY WOULD.
RIGHT, NESSING?

00:21.255 --> 00:23.622
YEAH. YOU KNOW,

THANK YOU.

00:52.869 --> 00:54.669
THOUGHT JOE
COULD PULL IT OFF.

00:54.671 --> 00:56.604
SHE'S SUCH A PRUDE,

YOU THINK HE'LL LIKE ME?

01:02.830 --> 01:04.611
OF COURSE HE WILL.
HE ALREADY DOES.

01:04.614 --> 01:07.398
TURN AROUND.
TURN AROUND.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.333
[both giggling]

01:08.335 --> 01:10.902
OH, THAT MUST BE JOE.

01:14.307 --> 01:16.624
TESSA, WHAT'S WRONG?

01:22.531 --> 01:24.582
[gasps]

01:28.687 --> 01:31.322
PAUL, YOU SURE YOU
DON'T WANNA WEAR YOUR TUX?

01:31.324 --> 01:32.657
I LIKE WEARING
DAD'S.

01:32.659 --> 01:34.809
THEN WEAR IT RIGHT.

01:34.811 --> 01:36.411
COME ON.

01:37.646 --> 01:39.113
DOESN'T HE LOOK
GREAT, BILL?

01:39.115 --> 01:40.915
JUST DON'T MESS UP

KIANA, HAVE YOU
SEEN TESSA?

02:04.824 --> 02:08.026
[laughs] BACK OFF, GUMP.
SHE'S NOT HERE.

02:08.027 --> 02:10.529
AND IF SHE WAS, WOULD SHE
BE LOOKING FOR YOU?

02:10.531 --> 02:12.997
GET REAL, PAUL.

02:15.434 --> 02:16.834
<i>HE RUINED EVERYTHING.</i>

02:16.836 --> 02:19.103
PAUL TOLD HIM WE'RE
ALL A BUNCH OF LESBOS.

02:19.105 --> 02:21.005
AND THAT'S WHY
JOE DUMPED YOU?

02:21.007 --> 02:24.008
PAUL IS
SO GONNA REGRET THAT.

02:24.010 --> 02:25.910
SO REGRET IT.

(Goren) MANOR HILL... LOOKS
MORE LIKE A COLLEGE

05:00.550 --> 05:01.882
THAN IT DOES A HIGH SCHOOL.

05:01.884 --> 05:03.184
(Eames) COST MORE LIKE ONE TOO.

05:03.186 --> 05:04.752
THE DECEASED IS
PAUL PHILLIPS, 17.

05:04.754 --> 05:06.504
DAD'S A BIG CEO.

05:06.506 --> 05:08.289
SCHOOL'S HEADMASTER
HAS MAJOR CASE PULLED IN

05:08.291 --> 05:09.523
FOR A HANGING?

05:09.525 --> 05:11.793
HE THINKS THE LOCAL PRECINCT
DOESN'T LIKE HIS KIDS.

05:11.795 --> 05:13.694
ON THAT, HE'D BE RIGHT.

05:13.696 --> 05:16.464
ANNA NOBEEL FOUND THE BODY
AROUND 4:00 P.M.

05:16.466 --> 05:18.800
IT'S NOBILE.

05:18.802 --> 05:20.634
PAUL WAS A STUDENT
OF MINE.

05:20.636 --> 05:22.336
YOU NOTICE ANYTHING?
WAS HE DEPRESSED?

05:22.338 --> 05:23.688
NO.

05:23.690 --> 05:25.706
BUT PAUL LIVED
IN HIS OWN WORLD.

05:25.708 --> 05:27.809
NOT ONE OF THE POPULAR KIDS.
MM-MM.

05:27.811 --> 05:29.978
<i>(Eames) WAS HE NEW HERE?</i>

05:29.980 --> 05:32.731
(Anna) NO, HE WAS IN
THE 14-YEAR CLUB...

05:32.733 --> 05:34.248
KIDS WHO STARTED
IN PRE-K.

05:34.250 --> 05:37.301
BUT THE LONGER HE STAYED,
THE LESS HE FIT IN.

05:37.303 --> 05:40.071
DID HE BELONG TO ANY GROUPS,
PLAY SPORTS?

05:40.073 --> 05:41.706
UH... JUST CROSS-COUNTRY.

05:41.708 --> 05:45.226
THE LONELINESS
OF THE LONG DISTANCE RUNNER.

05:45.228 --> 05:47.028
COULD YOU JUST
TURN AROUND FOR ME,

05:47.030 --> 05:48.162
SPIN AROUND?

05:48.164 --> 05:50.815
JUST ONCE. JUST...

05:50.817 --> 05:52.650
[chuckles]

05:55.054 --> 05:57.622
YOU HAVE, UH,
PAINT FLECKS...

05:57.624 --> 05:59.758
ALL OVER YOU, YEAH.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.876
OH, UM...
FROM THE BOILER ROOM.

06:01.878 --> 06:07.081
I TRIED TO HOLD PAUL'S
BODY UP WHILE I CALLED FOR HELP.

06:07.083 --> 06:09.317
THE BOILER ROOM?
WHAT WERE YOU DOING DOWN THERE?

06:09.319 --> 06:10.818
WELL, THE DOOR
TO THE TUNNELS

06:10.820 --> 06:12.253
IS SUPPOSED TO BE
LOCKED.

06:12.255 --> 06:13.587
IT WAS WIDE OPEN.

06:13.589 --> 06:15.940
<i>(Biaggi)</i>
<i>UH... HEADMASTER'S WAITING.</i>

06:17.026 --> 06:19.411
A REAL CYA.

06:19.413 --> 06:20.794
(Eames) LET ME GUESS...

06:20.796 --> 06:23.297
KIDS COME DOWN HERE
TO HOOK UP AND GET HIGH.

06:23.299 --> 06:24.798
WELL, THEY CALL IT
THE TUNNELS.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.501
IN THE '30s, THE SENIORS
BUILT A STILL DOWN HERE.

06:27.503 --> 06:29.203
KEIFER GATES,
HEADMASTER.

06:29.205 --> 06:31.906
IN HINDSIGHT,
PAUL SHOULD HAVE BEEN

06:31.908 --> 06:34.075
IN A LESS
COMPETITIVE SCHOOL.

06:34.077 --> 06:37.211
THIS WAS A TRAGEDY
WAITING TO HAPPEN.

06:38.781 --> 06:40.247
RIGOR IS JUST SETTING IN.

06:40.249 --> 06:43.217
THIS WOUND ON HIS NECK,
IT'S NOT VERY DEEP.

06:46.521 --> 06:48.122
<i>(Eames) THERE'S SOME KIND OF</i>

06:48.124 --> 06:50.091
SAILOR'S KNOT
TIED AT THIS END.

06:50.093 --> 06:52.093
IT'S A BOWLINE.

06:52.095 --> 06:55.329
SO HE, UH, GETS THE NOOSE
OVER THE PIPE,

06:55.331 --> 06:57.665
KICKS THE CHAIR OUT.

07:00.535 --> 07:03.537
SHOULD BE MORE...
PAINT CHIPS.

07:06.175 --> 07:08.542
I MEAN, EVEN IF SOMEONE
WANTS TO KILL HIMSELF,

07:08.544 --> 07:11.612
YOU KNOW, THE BODY STILL
FIGHTS TO SURVIVE.

07:11.614 --> 07:13.915
CELL PHONE, BACKPACK...

07:13.917 --> 07:15.282
MIA.

07:15.284 --> 07:16.584
WE'RE SEARCHING THE GROUNDS.

07:16.586 --> 07:20.287
MUD ON HIS SNEAKERS
IS STILL FRESH.

07:20.289 --> 07:22.590
SO HE HANGED HIMSELF,

07:22.592 --> 07:25.409
<i>BUT DECIDED TO GO</i>
<i>FOR A TRAINING RUN FIRST?</i>

07:26.946 --> 07:29.080
PAUL WAS DOING BETTER.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.482
HE WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING
FORWARD TO THE PROM.

07:33.052 --> 07:35.086
HE HAS A NICE SMILE.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.787
HOW'D PROM GO?

07:36.789 --> 07:38.356
I DON'T KNOW.

07:38.358 --> 07:40.492
<i>BILL HAD A SAILING</i>
<i>REGATTA THIS WEEKEND.</i>

07:40.494 --> 07:41.676
WE GOT BACK TODAY.

07:41.678 --> 07:44.279
YOU SAIL, MR. PHILLIPS?

07:44.281 --> 07:45.980
YEAH.

07:45.982 --> 07:47.248
PAUL SAIL?

07:47.250 --> 07:49.817
HE TRIED.
HE'D GET SEASICK.

07:49.819 --> 07:51.468
<i>(Eames) NEITHER OF YOU</i>

07:51.470 --> 07:53.137
SPOKE TO PAUL
SINCE FRIDAY?

07:53.139 --> 07:54.839
<i>WE WERE TRYING TO FOSTER</i>

07:54.841 --> 07:57.708
MORE INDEPENDENCE.

07:59.545 --> 08:01.645
<i>BUILD HIS SELF-ESTEEM.</i>

08:01.647 --> 08:02.563
<i>(Goren) THIS TUX HERE,</i>

08:02.565 --> 08:05.550
THE ONE IN THE PHOTO,

08:05.552 --> 08:06.534
<i>IS THIS YOURS?</i>

08:06.536 --> 08:08.336
<i>IT JUST LOOKS BIG ON HIM.</i>

08:08.338 --> 08:10.305
HE LIKES TO BORROW
MY THINGS.

08:10.307 --> 08:12.573
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
HE SPILLED SOMETHING ON IT

08:12.575 --> 08:15.910
AND THEN PUT THE WHOLE THING
IN THE WASH.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.961
HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE?

08:17.963 --> 08:19.564
IT'S RUINED!

08:27.656 --> 08:29.257
MY BOY.

08:37.482 --> 08:41.184
HE JUST... YOU SAID
HE'D BEEN BETTER LATELY.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.754
IS HE ON MEDICATION?

08:42.756 --> 08:44.188
SEVERAL.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.422
[clears throat]

08:45.424 --> 08:47.625
BILL, THEY NEED
TO KNOW.

08:49.178 --> 08:51.245
I'LL GET YOU A LIST.

08:52.481 --> 08:55.132
SO PAUL'S MEDS
ARE ALL FOR DEPRESSION.

08:57.202 --> 09:00.204
WE WERE ALSO ON THE LOOKOUT
FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.139
THERE'S A HISTORY
IN BILL'S FAMILY.

09:04.342 --> 09:06.577
AND HE'S
EMBARRASSED BY IT.

09:06.579 --> 09:09.514
HE'S PRIVATE.

09:09.516 --> 09:11.649
DETECTIVE,
I DIDN'T SEE ANY SIGNS

09:11.651 --> 09:13.518
THAT PAUL WAS SLIPPING.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.520
MAYBE... A YEAR AGO.

09:15.522 --> 09:17.221
BUT RECENTLY...

09:17.223 --> 09:21.158
IT SEEMED LIKE HE WAS HAPPY
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

09:23.194 --> 09:24.762
CAUSE OF DEATH...

09:24.764 --> 09:27.098
ASPHYXIATION FROM HANGING.

09:27.100 --> 09:30.551
BUT HE DIDN'T
DO IT HIMSELF?

09:30.553 --> 09:32.719
NOT UNLESS HE FRACTURED
HIS OWN SKULL FIRST.

09:32.721 --> 09:34.155
HIS HAIR MASKED
THE BRUISING,

09:34.157 --> 09:36.257
BUT THERE WAS
EXTENSIVE INTERNAL BLEEDING.

09:36.259 --> 09:38.392
SO HE WAS OUT COLD
WHEN HE WAS HANGED.

09:38.394 --> 09:40.027
<i>(Goren) ANY OTHER BRUISES?</i>

09:40.029 --> 09:41.412
(Rodgers) JUST GETTIN' TO THAT.

09:45.634 --> 09:47.568
<i>THERE ARE MORE</i>

09:47.570 --> 09:49.470
AROUND THE KIDNEYS,
GROIN, BUTTOCKS.

09:49.472 --> 09:52.290
BUT THESE ARE FROM TWO
TO THREE DAYS BEFORE HIS DEATH.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.225
<i>HE LITERALLY</i>
<i>GOT HIS ASS KICKED.</i>

09:54.227 --> 09:57.095
<i>(Goren) NO HITS TO THE
FACE, UPPER BODY.</i>

09:57.097 --> 09:59.998
WE'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.265
IN ABUSED WIVES, CHILDREN.

10:01.267 --> 10:05.352
THE ABUSER KNOWS NOT TO HIT THEM
WHERE IT'LL SHOW.

10:05.354 --> 10:07.621
(Ross) SO PAUL TOOK A
BEATING ON SATURDAY

10:07.623 --> 10:09.590
AND WAS HANGED ON MONDAY.

10:09.592 --> 10:11.658
POOR KID.
HIS BACKPACK TURN UP?

10:11.660 --> 10:13.293
NOT AT HIS HOME,

10:13.295 --> 10:15.963
AND NOT IN MANOR HILL"
PUBLIC SPACES OR CLASSROOMS.

10:15.965 --> 10:17.497
WHAT ABOUT STUDENT LOCKERS?

10:17.499 --> 10:19.734
HIS SCHOOL'S LEGAL TEAM'S
GETTING BACK TO US ON THAT.

10:19.736 --> 10:22.837
THE PROBLEM MAY BE
LESS IN SCHOOL THAN IN HOUSE.

10:22.839 --> 10:24.939
TELL ME WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT BILL PHILLIPS.

10:24.941 --> 10:27.108
THE PIT BULL
IN PINSTRIPES.

10:27.110 --> 10:29.243
CORPORATE RAIDER.

10:29.245 --> 10:31.945
<i>BUYS UP COMPANIES, FIRES HALF</i>
<i>THE STAFF, BULLIES THE REST.</i>

10:31.947 --> 10:34.165
(Goren) BULLIES ARE
DISGUSTED BY WEAKNESS.

10:34.167 --> 10:37.935
HIS SON PAUL
WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT.

10:37.937 --> 10:39.937
A LOT OF DADS ARE DISAPPOINTED
BY THEIR KIDS.

10:39.939 --> 10:41.471
DOESN'T MEAN
THEY'D HANG THEM.

10:41.473 --> 10:43.857
WELL, PHILLIPS' FAMILY
HAS A HISTORY OF SCHIZOPHRENIA.

10:43.859 --> 10:47.328
I MEAN, HE KNOWS
THE MISERY, THE INEVITABILITY.

10:47.330 --> 10:50.014
HE COULD HAVE SEEN
HIS SON SLIPPING AND...

10:50.016 --> 10:51.448
CUT HIS LOSSES?

10:51.450 --> 10:53.818
I HOPE YOU'RE WRONG.

10:57.222 --> 10:59.190
YEAH!

10:59.192 --> 11:00.641
(Goren) WE WERE SURPRISED

11:00.643 --> 11:03.344
WHEN YOUR WIFE SAID
THAT YOU WERE PLAYING SQUASH.

11:03.346 --> 11:05.179
THAT'S HOW I DEAL
WITH BAD NEWS...

11:05.181 --> 11:06.948
GET OUT MY ANGER.

11:06.950 --> 11:08.950
I'M AFRAID WE MAY
HAVE MORE BAD NEWS.

11:08.952 --> 11:10.952
WE DON'T THINK PAUL
COMMITTED SUICIDE.

11:10.954 --> 11:12.453
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

11:12.455 --> 11:14.455
YOU TOLD US PAUL
DIDN'T HAVE MANY FRIENDS.

11:14.457 --> 11:17.458
MAYBE HE FELL IN
WITH A NEW CROWD RECENTLY,

11:17.460 --> 11:18.659
<i>A TOUGHER CROWD?</i>

11:18.661 --> 11:21.261
HE BARELY LEFT
HIS DAMN ROOM.

11:21.263 --> 11:22.313
HERE'S WHAT'S TROUBLING...

11:22.315 --> 11:26.117
PAUL WAS... HE WAS BEATEN
BADLY SOMETIME SATURDAY.

11:26.119 --> 11:30.804
BRUISES ALL OVER HIM
WHERE YOU COULDN'T SEE THEM.

11:30.806 --> 11:32.573
YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE
AWAY SAILING,

11:32.575 --> 11:34.608
BUT THE REGATTA
DIDN'T START TILL SUNDAY.

11:34.610 --> 11:36.126
WE MADE A WEEKEND OF IT.

11:36.128 --> 11:39.263
WHAT, YOU THINK I HIT HIM?
ARE YOU NUTS?

11:40.531 --> 11:44.001
WELL, YOU DO HAVE
A TEMPER.

11:44.003 --> 11:46.237
AND YOU HAVE YOUR NERVE.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.222
ANY MORE QUESTIONS?

11:48.224 --> 11:52.092
YEAH. WHERE WERE YA
MONDAY AFTERNOON?

11:55.364 --> 11:57.732
BOARD MEETING
IN VIRGINIA.

11:57.734 --> 12:01.502
I TOOK OFF IN MY GULFSTREAM
FROM TETERBORO AT 10:00 A.M.

12:01.504 --> 12:03.738
YOU KNOW, THEY TOLD ME

12:03.740 --> 12:06.974
THAT MAJOR CASE
WAS AN ELITE UNIT.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.676
I'M UNDERWHELMED.

12:08.678 --> 12:09.793
THANK YOU.

12:13.415 --> 12:15.900
IF HE WERE MY DAD,
I'D HIDE IN MY ROOM TOO.

12:17.635 --> 12:20.437
SO OUTCAST AT HOME,
OUTCAST AT SCHOOL.

12:21.840 --> 12:24.641
PAUL HAD TO HAVE
SOMEONE, RIGHT?

12:24.643 --> 12:26.394
<i>(Kiana) EVERYONE IS
GONNA HAVE TO GEEK UP</i>

12:26.396 --> 12:27.861
<i>AND WIPE THEIR</i>
<i>HARD DRIVES CLEAN.</i>

I EMAILED YOU ALL THE LINK.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.067
WAIT. WILL THIS ERASE
MY SCHOOL NOTES?

12:33.069 --> 12:36.103
NO, BOO, ONLY THE TARGET FILE
GETS SNUFFED.

12:36.105 --> 12:38.022

12:38.024 --> 12:38.889
CHECK IT.

12:47.532 --> 12:49.399
THE GRIEF COUNSELOR
GAVE YOU MY NAME?

12:49.401 --> 12:51.702
<i>(Eames) SHE JUST TOLD US</i>

12:51.704 --> 12:52.769
YOU AND PAUL
WERE FRIENDS.

12:52.771 --> 12:55.039
SHE DIDN'T TELL US
WHAT YOU TWO SPOKE ABOUT.

12:55.041 --> 12:57.241
WELL, NOT MANY STUDENTS
SPOKE TO HER AT ALL, JACK.

12:57.243 --> 12:59.510
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO SAY?

12:59.512 --> 13:02.229
THE OFFICERS AREN'T CONVINCED
PAUL KILLED HIMSELF.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.116
OH.

13:10.638 --> 13:12.807
IF THIS ISN'T
A GOOD PLACE TO TALK...

13:12.809 --> 13:14.591
I JUST DON'T WANNA MISS
ANY CLASS WORK.

13:14.593 --> 13:17.228
YEAH, I THINK
THAT WE WOULD RATHER

13:17.230 --> 13:19.463
TALK TO YOU AT YOUR HOME.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.282
ALL RIGHT.

13:21.284 --> 13:22.499

13:29.391 --> 13:32.726
THIS NEEDS TO STAY
OFF THE RECORD.

13:35.797 --> 13:37.498
SORRY.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.967
SO, UH...

13:39.969 --> 13:42.903
PAUL TALK TO YOU
ABOUT, UH,

13:42.905 --> 13:44.805
WHO BEAT HIM UP
OVER THE WEEKEND?

13:44.807 --> 13:46.474
HE GOT BEAT UP?

13:48.743 --> 13:50.110
OH...

13:50.112 --> 13:52.112
OH, WHAT, JACK?

13:52.114 --> 13:54.014
THAT'S WHY HE MADE THE VIDEO.

14:00.204 --> 14:02.573
PAUL JUST SAID
HE WAS FED UP

14:02.575 --> 14:04.307
AND HE WASN'T GONNA
TAKE IT ANYMORE.

14:06.694 --> 14:09.463

YEAH, TESS NOBILE
AND KIANA RICHMOND.

14:17.990 --> 14:19.590
NOBILE. IS SHE
RELATED TO THE TEACHER?

14:19.592 --> 14:21.058
HER DAUGHTER.

14:21.060 --> 14:23.027
<i>I TOLD PAUL NOT TO SEND IT.</i>

14:23.029 --> 14:26.063
BUT BY NOON ON MONDAY,

14:26.065 --> 14:28.933
HE'D ALREADY V-CAST IT
TO HALF THE STUDENT BODY.

14:28.935 --> 14:31.385
AND FOUR HOURS LATER,
HE WAS DEAD.

14:38.509 --> 14:40.010
YOU WANNA INVADE
OUR PRIVACY,

14:40.012 --> 14:41.745
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO CUT OUR LOCK.

14:47.218 --> 14:49.770
WE DON'T HAVE PAUL'S BACKPACK.
THIS IS CRAZY.

14:51.305 --> 14:52.957

MY LOCKER.

14:52.959 --> 14:55.676

15:02.785 --> 15:04.418
THIS ONE
IS MY DAUGHTER'S,

15:04.420 --> 15:06.520

ANOTHER PART OF HER HARD DRIVE.

15:37.903 --> 15:39.936

PAUL'S PRANK VIDEO.

15:39.938 --> 15:42.606

THE WEAK LINK.

WHICH GIRLS ON YOUR TEAM
DID THIS?

18:12.775 --> 18:14.542
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK
TO THEM.

18:14.544 --> 18:17.044
THE WARRANT IS ONLY
FOR YOUR COMPUTER.

THERE'S A LOT OF...
THAT'S BEFORE PROM NIGHT.

18:28.090 --> 18:29.289
SO CLICK ON...

18:29.291 --> 18:30.541
DON'T, PLEASE.

18:30.543 --> 18:33.544
I THINK I CAN HELP.

18:33.546 --> 18:36.397
THOSE ARE MY TEAMMATES,
BUT I WASN'T THERE.

18:36.399 --> 18:38.298
YOU WEREN'T?
MOM.

18:38.300 --> 18:41.751
THEY DID IT
BECAUSE PAUL HURT ME.

18:41.753 --> 18:46.056
SEE, I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO
TO THE PROM WITH LUVFORTY, JOE...

18:46.058 --> 18:47.724
LUVFORTY, TENNIS PLAYER.
YEAH.

18:47.726 --> 18:50.594
BUT PAUL TOLD HIM THE LACROSSE
TEAM WAS ALL LESBIANS,

18:50.596 --> 18:52.312
SO JOE DITCHED ME.

18:52.314 --> 18:55.532
PAUL HAD IT IN FOR YOU.
ANY IDEA WHY?

18:55.534 --> 18:58.702
THAT'S THE WEIRD THING.
I ASKED PAUL WHY HE HATED ME.

18:58.704 --> 19:01.154
AFTER HIS TAPE WENT OUT.
<i>UH-HUH.</i>

19:01.156 --> 19:02.456
HE SAID HE DIDN'T.

19:02.458 --> 19:06.877
THAT HE LOVED ME
WAY MORE THAN JOE.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.829
<i>WERE YOU SURPRISED?</i>

19:08.831 --> 19:11.064
WE NEVER EVEN HUNG OUT.

19:13.067 --> 19:14.434
I TOLD HIM...

19:14.436 --> 19:17.104
YOU'RE THE LAST PERSON
ON EARTH I COULD EVER LOVE.

19:17.106 --> 19:19.106
HE STARTED CRYING.

19:19.108 --> 19:21.742
AND THEN HE RAN OFF
INTO THE TUNNELS.

19:23.562 --> 19:25.729
IF HE KILLED HIMSELF
BECAUSE OF ME...

19:25.731 --> 19:27.898
DID YOU TELL ANYONE
ABOUT WHAT PAUL SAID?

19:29.233 --> 19:32.035
KIANA.
BEFORE LACROSSE PRACTICE.

19:33.287 --> 19:35.188
HOW DID SHE REACT?

19:37.258 --> 19:39.610
HEY, YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM
WHAT YOU KNOW.

19:43.381 --> 19:45.298
KIANA TOLD ME NOT TO WORRY.

19:45.300 --> 19:48.185
SHE WAS GONNA PUT
AN END TO IT.

19:49.337 --> 19:51.738
I WAS AT LACROSSE PRACTICE
WHEN PAUL DIED.

19:51.740 --> 19:53.624
ASK MY TEAMMATES.

19:53.626 --> 19:54.992
WE DID.
THEY BACK YOU.

19:54.994 --> 19:57.494
BUT YOUR COACH SAID
YOU WERE HALF AN HOUR LATE.

19:57.496 --> 19:58.728
HE SAID, THEY SAID.

19:58.730 --> 20:00.931
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT, PAUL?

20:00.933 --> 20:03.433
WAS IT THAT HE WAS
A WEIRD KID, YOU KNOW,

20:03.435 --> 20:05.118
AWKWARD, ALWAYS STARING?

20:05.120 --> 20:06.386
I HAD NOTHING
AGAINST PAUL

20:06.388 --> 20:08.706
UNTIL HE STARTED
DISSING ME.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.241
OH, NO, YOU MEAN DISSING
YOU AND TESSA.

20:11.243 --> 20:14.511
NOW, WERE YOU MAD AT HIM
BECAUSE HE OUTED YOU?

20:14.513 --> 20:17.013
OR MAYBE BECAUSE
HE HAD THE GUTS TO SAY SOMETHING

20:17.015 --> 20:20.633
THAT YOU NEVER COULD,
THAT HE HAD A CRUSH ON TESSA?

20:20.635 --> 20:22.552
MY DAUGHTER
IS NOT A MURDERER,

20:22.554 --> 20:24.388
AND SHE IS NOT A LESBIAN.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.473
WHICH OF THOSE SCARES YOU MORE,
MR. RICHMOND?

20:26.475 --> 20:27.758
YOU DON'T KNOW
MY DAUGHTER.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.110
NEITHER DO YOU.

20:30.112 --> 20:32.262
LOOK PAUL DESERVED
TO BE GOT...

20:32.264 --> 20:34.297
BUT I DIDN'T KILL HIM.

20:34.299 --> 20:36.734
<i>MY PLAN WAS TO JAM</i>
<i>HIS BIKE LOCK,</i>

20:36.736 --> 20:37.767
MAKE HIM WALK HOME.

20:37.769 --> 20:40.204
LIGHT PUNISHMENT.
<i>IT WOULDN'T BE.</i>

20:40.206 --> 20:42.138
ONCE WE SHOVED HIM
IN A CAR TRUNK,

20:42.140 --> 20:44.407
STRIPPED HIM, AND DUMPED HIM
IN THE SOUTH BRONX.

20:44.409 --> 20:45.775
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE SOUTH BRONX?

20:45.777 --> 20:48.145
I KNOW THINGS, DAD.
GET USED TO IT.

20:48.147 --> 20:50.013
<i>MESSING WITH HIS BIKE</i>

20:50.015 --> 20:52.565
MADE ME LATE FOR PRACTICE.

20:52.567 --> 20:54.218
THERE WERE NO SIGNS
OF TAMPERING.

20:54.220 --> 20:55.953
THAT'S BECAUSE
MS. NOBILE CAUGHT ME.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.487
<i>(Goren)</i>
<i>MS. NOBILE.</i>

20:57.489 --> 20:58.872
YOU'RE SURE.

20:58.874 --> 21:00.440
SHE ASKED ME
WHAT I WAS DOING.

21:00.442 --> 21:02.442
I SAID GETTING BACK
AT PAUL.

21:02.444 --> 21:05.212
FOR HIS VIDEO.
SO SHE KNEW.

21:05.214 --> 21:06.530
I SHOWED IT TO HER.

21:06.532 --> 21:09.383
SHE NEEDED TO KNOW WHAT PAUL DID
TO HER DAUGHTER.

21:09.385 --> 21:11.351
SHE SAID GO BACK TO PRACTICE,
FORGET ABOUT IT.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.470
SHE'D TALK TO PAUL.

21:16.057 --> 21:17.724
[knock on door]

21:17.726 --> 21:19.025
CAN I TALK TO YOU ABOUT PAUL?

21:19.027 --> 21:22.029
JERRY, CAN WE HAVE
A MINUTE?

21:24.849 --> 21:28.318
I'VE KNOWN PAUL...
SINCE WE WERE FOUR.

21:28.320 --> 21:31.037
NO ONE EVER BULLIED HIM
WHILE I WAS AROUND.

21:31.039 --> 21:33.873
MM. YEAH. YOU WERE
A GOOD FRIEND TO HIM.

21:33.875 --> 21:36.576
I STILL AM.

21:36.578 --> 21:39.913
LOOK, MS. NOBILE...

21:39.915 --> 21:42.583
I REALLY HOPE TESS
WASN'T INVOLVED IN THIS.

21:44.319 --> 21:46.553
BUT IF SHE WAS...

21:46.555 --> 21:48.839
SHE'S GONNA PAY.

21:55.630 --> 21:56.930
ANNA NOBILE

21:56.932 --> 22:00.033
TELLS KIANA SHE'S GONNA HAVE
A TALK WITH PAUL,

22:00.035 --> 22:02.603
AND THEN SHE DISCOVERS
HIS BODY.

22:02.605 --> 22:04.571
SHE SAY ANYTHING WHEN
HER DAUGHTER IMPLICATED KIANA?

22:04.573 --> 22:06.056
NOT A WORD.

22:06.058 --> 22:08.592
HOW DID WE MISS HER
ON THE FIRST PASS?

22:08.594 --> 22:10.761
SHE'S A RENAISSANCE ART SCHOLAR
AND A MOM.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.328

AT RISD TO MANOR HILL?

22:23.542 --> 22:26.476
TURNS OUT WHEN MOM
SIGNED ON TO TEACH,

22:26.478 --> 22:28.244
TESSA GOT
A FULL SCHOLARSHIP.

22:28.246 --> 22:29.963
<i>ANNA PUT HER CAREER ASIDE</i>

22:29.965 --> 22:34.418
TO ENSURE THE DAUGHTER
HAD THE BEST SHOT POSSIBLE.

22:34.420 --> 22:36.220
IF SHE EVER THOUGHT
THAT TESSA'S FUTURE

22:36.222 --> 22:38.138
WAS BEING THREATENED...

22:38.140 --> 22:40.206
TELL HEADMASTER GATES
WE WANNA GO AHEAD

22:40.208 --> 22:42.042

22:43.311 --> 22:45.646
TELL HIM WE'LL BE BY
WITH A WARRANT

22:45.648 --> 22:47.814
AND A DOZEN TABLOID
PHOTOGRAPHERS BY LUNCH.

22:47.816 --> 22:49.650
THAT WOULD BE
A BLUFF?

22:49.652 --> 22:52.102
THAT WOULD.

22:52.104 --> 22:53.804
HOW WELL DID YOU KNOW
PAUL PHILLIPS?

22:53.806 --> 22:56.807
HE WAS IN ONE
OF MY FIVE CLASSES.

22:56.809 --> 22:59.142
DID HE EVER COME
FOR OFFICE HOURS?

22:59.144 --> 23:02.980
NEVER. HE HAD A HARD TIME
JUST MAKING EYE CONTACT.

23:02.982 --> 23:05.749
REALLY, MS. NOBILE?

23:07.485 --> 23:10.821
LOOKS LIKE I HAVE
PAUL PHILLIPS' PHONE AND...

23:10.823 --> 23:13.523
MR. PHILLIPS' NOTEBOOKS.

23:21.599 --> 23:24.951
MONDAY AFTERNOON,
RIGHT BEFORE PAUL WAS KILLED,

23:24.953 --> 23:29.205
KIANA SHOWED YOU
THE VIDEO HE MADE.

23:29.207 --> 23:31.374
YOU DIDN'T TELL US
ABOUT THAT.

23:31.376 --> 23:33.443
I WAS PROTECTING
MY DAUGHTER.

23:33.445 --> 23:35.195
I WAS AFRAID TESSA
WAS PART OF THAT PACK

23:35.197 --> 23:36.647
THAT BEAT UP PAUL.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.615
THEY COULD EXPEL HER
FOR THAT.

23:38.617 --> 23:40.750
BUT SHE SAID
SHE WASN'T THERE.

23:40.752 --> 23:44.288
I WASN'T SURE
SHE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.

23:44.290 --> 23:46.706
AND WE'RE NOT SURE
IF YOU'RE TELLING THE TRUTH.

23:46.708 --> 23:50.627
PAUL RUINED TESSA'S PROM
AND HER FIRST LOVE.

23:50.629 --> 23:53.847
AND THEN YOU SAW
THE VIDEO HE MADE...

23:53.849 --> 23:56.583
AND YOU RAN OFF
IN A RAGE TO FIND HIM.

23:56.585 --> 24:00.987
WHICH I DID...
HANGING FROM A PIPE.

24:00.989 --> 24:02.989
MAYBE YOU STRUNG HIM UP
OVER THAT PIPE.

24:02.991 --> 24:04.274
ME?

24:04.276 --> 24:05.759
[laughs]

24:05.761 --> 24:09.096
I COULD BARELY
HOLD UP PAUL'S LEGS

24:09.098 --> 24:11.198
WHEN I TRIED TO SAVE HIM.

24:11.200 --> 24:14.367
IF THERE'S ANYONE
I WANNA KILL, IT'S JOE.

24:15.770 --> 24:17.604
YOU DIDN'T LIKE JOE?

24:17.606 --> 24:18.905
I NEVER MET HIM.

24:18.907 --> 24:21.625
TESSA ONLY MET HIM ONCE
AT A PARTY.

24:21.627 --> 24:23.777
THEY CALL IT
A CYBER RELATIONSHIP.

24:25.196 --> 24:28.699
BUT I SAW HIS WEB PAGE,
I READ HIS EMAILS,

24:28.701 --> 24:31.118
AND I THOUGHT HE WAS
THE PERFECT BOY FOR HER.

24:31.120 --> 24:33.219
SHE LET YOU READ
HIS EMAILS.

24:33.221 --> 24:35.121
IN THE BEGINNING.

24:35.123 --> 24:39.092
SHE WANTED MY APPROVAL,
AND I GAVE IT, FREELY.

24:39.094 --> 24:41.845
HE HAD SUCH POETRY.

24:41.847 --> 24:44.848
SO HE WAS A...

24:44.850 --> 24:48.451
LIKE A...
A SENSITIVE SOUL.

24:50.387 --> 24:53.724
WHAT... WHAT MADE YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT HIM?

24:53.726 --> 24:55.926
AFTER PROM WEEKEND,

24:55.928 --> 24:58.529
THERE WAS AN ENVELOPE
UNDER MY OFFICE DOOR

24:58.531 --> 25:00.313
FROM JOE

25:00.315 --> 25:04.300
WITH PHOTOS OF PAUL
BEING BEATEN BY THE GIRLS.

25:04.302 --> 25:07.937
JOE'S NOTE SAID THAT
TESSA WAS ONE OF THEM

25:07.939 --> 25:10.206
AND THAT HE'D POST
THE VIDEO ONLINE

25:10.208 --> 25:13.026
UNLESS I RESIGNED.

25:15.780 --> 25:18.248
YOU WERE BEING BLACKMAILED.

25:18.250 --> 25:19.515
MM-HMM.

25:21.902 --> 25:24.888
DID YOU TELL ANYONE
AT SCHOOL?

25:24.890 --> 25:27.040
AT MANOR HILL?

25:27.042 --> 25:29.109
[laughs]

25:29.111 --> 25:30.794
PLEASE.

25:30.796 --> 25:33.897
THOSE OTHER GIRLS WOULD BE
PROTECTED BY THEIR PARENTS,

25:33.899 --> 25:37.684
BUT IF TESSA WERE INVOLVED,

25:37.686 --> 25:39.619
SHE'D BE THE SCAPEGOAT,

25:39.621 --> 25:42.189
KICKED OUT RIGHT BEFORE
HER SENIOR YEAR.

25:46.911 --> 25:48.995
ANNA'S STORY CHECKS OUT.

25:48.997 --> 25:51.097
HERE'S A COPY OF
THE BLACKMAIL LETTER FROM JOE,

25:51.099 --> 25:53.417
<i>AND THE PHOTOS.</i>

25:55.420 --> 25:56.903
OKAY, SO JOE'S A BLACKMAILER.

25:56.905 --> 25:58.755
WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO SAY
ABOUT PAUL'S MURDER?

25:58.757 --> 26:00.640
WE'RE STILL TRYING
TO FIND HIM.

26:00.642 --> 26:03.310
BRISTOL ACADEMY
IS NOT BEING COOPERATIVE.

26:03.312 --> 26:06.346
TERRIFIC. TRACK HIM
THROUGH HIS FRIENDPOST PAGE?

26:06.348 --> 26:07.780
HE TOOK IT DOWN.

FOR AN "A" THEY'D KILL?

33:26.137 --> 33:27.369
NESSING'S ALREADY
ADMITTED TO BROWN.

33:27.371 --> 33:29.105
<i>BUT THE OTHER TWO ARE JUNIORS.</i>

33:29.107 --> 33:31.624
BRANT'S A LEGACY
AT YALE.

33:31.626 --> 33:34.894
<i>AND WALKER'S FAMILY</i>
<i>WENT TO HARVARD.</i>

33:34.896 --> 33:36.162
BRING 'EM IN.

33:36.164 --> 33:38.832
ONE OF 'EM ISN'T GOING
IVY LEAGUE.

33:38.834 --> 33:41.100
NESSING.

33:41.102 --> 33:45.872
OH, YOU'RE THE KID WHO
SOLD YOUR KEY TO THE JUNIORS

33:45.874 --> 33:48.791
SO THAT THEY COULD HAVE A PARTY
AT YOUR HOUSE, RIGHT?

33:48.793 --> 33:52.111
DAD TOLD ME
TO BE MORE INDUSTRIOUS.

33:52.113 --> 33:54.747
I TELL YOU, THAT PRANK'S BECOME
PRETTY LEGENDARY. [Chuckles]

33:57.884 --> 34:02.555
AND WHAT ABOUT
CREATING JOE?

34:02.557 --> 34:04.190
WAS THAT GONNA BE
YOUR NEXT LEGENDARY PRANK?

34:04.192 --> 34:05.942
LOOK, IF TESS THOUGHT
SHE COULD LAND A GUY LIKE THAT,

34:05.944 --> 34:08.010
SHE DESERVED TO GET PUNKED.

34:08.012 --> 34:09.946
I'M JUST SAYING.

34:09.947 --> 34:11.331
PAUL LIKED TESS,

34:11.333 --> 34:13.514
SO WE CREATED JOE
AS A CYRANO THING.

34:13.516 --> 34:16.252
AND PROM NIGHT WAS GONNA BE
BAIT AND SWITCH.

34:16.254 --> 34:17.170
YEAH.

34:17.172 --> 34:18.938
WHEN PAUL TOLD HER
HE WAS JOE,

34:18.940 --> 34:20.356
SHE'D FALL FOR HIM.

34:20.358 --> 34:23.842
TWO LAST PICKS
FINDING TRUE LOVE TOGETHER.

34:23.844 --> 34:25.194
EXCEPT THAT WAS
NEVER GONNA HAPPEN

34:25.196 --> 34:29.264
BECAUSE THIS WAS NEVER
ABOUT TESSA OR PAUL.

34:29.266 --> 34:32.335
THE REAL TARGET WAS
MS. NOBILE.

34:32.337 --> 34:35.237
<i>JOE GETS TESSA</i>
<i>TO STRIP ON CAMERA,</i>

34:35.239 --> 34:38.408
AND YOU GUYS BLACKMAIL
HER MOTHER TO RESIGN.

34:38.409 --> 34:41.627
WHAT'S WRONG WITH TRYING
TO GET RID OF A TEACHER

34:41.629 --> 34:43.094
WHO MAKES YOU DO
COMMUNITY SERVICE

34:43.097 --> 34:44.263
AND GIVES OUT "C" s?

34:44.264 --> 34:46.498
IS THERE A CRIME IN THAT?

34:46.501 --> 34:47.583
HE'S RIGHT,
DETECTIVE.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.284
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
HARMLESS SCHOOLBOY PRANKS.

34:49.286 --> 34:51.437
NO, WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT MURDER.

34:51.438 --> 34:53.072
I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH MURDER.

34:53.074 --> 34:54.591
ONE OF YOU DID.

34:54.592 --> 34:57.293
NOW, IF IT WASN'T YOU,
WHO WAS IT?

34:57.295 --> 35:00.597
<i>NESSING OR JACK?</i>

35:00.599 --> 35:05.751
LOYALTY OR YALE?
YOUR CALL.

35:09.673 --> 35:12.558
NESSING'S THE PICADOR.

35:12.560 --> 35:15.645
JACK'S THE MATADOR.

35:18.265 --> 35:21.066
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT,
DETECTIVES?

35:21.068 --> 35:23.302
DO YOU HAVE A SUSPECT
IN PAUL'S MURDER?

35:23.304 --> 35:24.770
JOE CARDINAL.

35:24.772 --> 35:25.971
HE GOES
TO ANOTHER SCHOOL,

35:25.973 --> 35:27.190
AND HE WAS A FRIEND
OF PAUL'S.

35:27.192 --> 35:29.142
THEN WHAT DOES THIS
HAVE TO DO WITH JACK?

35:29.144 --> 35:32.445
WE NEED JACK TO TELL US
ALL HE CAN ABOUT JOE.

35:32.447 --> 35:35.315
DAD, I NEVER EVEN MET
THE GUY.

35:35.317 --> 35:37.333
EASY, WE KNOW
YOU RAN ERRANDS FOR HIM.

35:37.335 --> 35:40.186
<i>(Stanford) THESE ERRANDS,</i>

35:40.188 --> 35:41.437

IF THEY MIGHT LEAD...

35:41.439 --> 35:42.471
MR. WALKER,

35:42.473 --> 35:43.540
THE ONLY PERSON

35:43.542 --> 35:45.374
WE'RE INTERESTED
IN PROSECUTING IS JOE.

35:47.244 --> 35:49.278
ALL RIGHT, THEN, SON,
TELL THEM WHAT YOU KNOW.

35:50.997 --> 35:52.398
NO.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.833
I'M NOT GONNA RAT
ANYBODY OUT.

35:53.835 --> 35:55.685
DO NOT BE AN IDIOT.

35:55.687 --> 35:57.136
YOU'RE NOT GONNA THROW AWAY
YOUR FUTURE

35:57.138 --> 35:58.621

35:58.623 --> 36:01.641
<i>(Stanford) WALKER, IT'S

36:01.643 --> 36:03.276
<i>JACK IS AN OUTSTANDING</i>

36:03.278 --> 36:04.393
SCHOLAR/ATHLETE.

36:04.395 --> 36:05.528
HIS FUTURE IS BRIGHT.

36:05.530 --> 36:06.962
HE MEANS
I'M GOING TO HARVARD.

36:06.964 --> 36:08.898
<i>(Eames)</i>
<i>DON'T COUNT ON THAT, JACK.</i>

36:08.900 --> 36:11.617

36:11.619 --> 36:13.185
<i>A FELONY.</i>

36:13.187 --> 36:15.471
YOU JUST SAID YOU WEREN'T
INTERESTED IN PROSECUTING HIM.

36:15.473 --> 36:18.124
DAD, HELLO?
THEY'RE BLUFFING.

36:18.126 --> 36:21.578
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH IT TOOK

36:21.580 --> 36:22.912
TO GET YOU THIS FAR?

36:22.914 --> 36:26.832
YOUR GRANDFATHER AND I DONATED
A COMPUTER ROOM AT MANOR HILL

36:26.834 --> 36:29.719
TO KEEP YOU ENROLLED
AFTER MIDDLE SCHOOL.

36:29.721 --> 36:31.487
THAT WAS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL, DAD.

36:31.489 --> 36:33.656
WE'VE BEEN ENDOWING A CHAIR

36:34.826 --> 36:35.825
YEAH, I KNOW.

36:35.827 --> 36:38.594
SO TELL ME,
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

36:41.631 --> 36:43.433
[Jack strikes billiard ball]

36:43.435 --> 36:44.901
TELL HIM.

36:47.204 --> 36:49.288
COME ON.
GO AHEAD, TELL HIM.

36:49.290 --> 36:51.223
TELL HIM HOW SICK YOU ARE

36:51.225 --> 36:53.259
<i>OF HEARING THAT YOU'LL</i>
<i>NEVER MAKE IT ON YOUR OWN.</i>

36:53.261 --> 36:56.378
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.

36:56.380 --> 36:59.432
AREN'T YOU ON THE TENNIS TEAM,
SCOUTS AND SCHOLARS?

36:59.434 --> 37:01.434

37:01.436 --> 37:02.635
<i>(Eames) WOW.</i>

37:02.637 --> 37:03.669
FOUR DECIMALS.

37:03.671 --> 37:05.304
SO WHY DOES YOUR DAD THINK
YOU NEED TO BE CARRIED?

37:05.306 --> 37:07.306
WHAT'S WRONG WITH A FATHER
HELPING HIS SON?

37:07.308 --> 37:10.493
I DON'T NEED HELP.
ESPECIALLY NOT FROM YOU.

37:10.495 --> 37:13.345
<i>(Goren) HE'S RIGHT.</i>

37:13.347 --> 37:14.563
I MEAN, HE'S
A SUCCESSFUL YOUNG MAN,

37:14.565 --> 37:16.632

HE'S A FAILURE.

37:16.634 --> 37:17.900
I MEAN, THAT'S...

37:17.902 --> 37:19.502
OKAY, YOU ARE WAY
OUT OF LINE HERE.

37:19.504 --> 37:21.604
AND YOU BETTER START TALKING
TO THEM

37:21.606 --> 37:22.805
<i>AND TELL THEM WHAT YOU KNOW.</i>

37:22.807 --> 37:24.674
I'M NOT GONNA RAT OUT JOE.

37:24.676 --> 37:26.025
<i>(Goren) GOOD FOR YOU.</i>

37:26.027 --> 37:27.960

37:30.532 --> 37:32.898
<i>(Walker) OKAY, JACK,</i>

37:32.900 --> 37:34.583

37:43.527 --> 37:45.060
YOU WOULD LIKE JOE.

HAVE YOU BITCHED

37:48.366 --> 37:51.867
ABOUT HOW THE SCHOOL
IS GOING DOWN THE TUBES,

AND HOW TEACHERS
LIKE MISS NOBILE

<i>(Goren)</i>
<i>TRUE. YEAH.</i>

LIKE THAT OUT OF CONTEXT.

38:36.530 --> 38:38.364

BEST INTEREST TO TAKE A BREAK.

38:38.366 --> 38:40.732
<i>(Eames) WHAT ABOUT KIANA?</i>

38:40.734 --> 38:42.501

YOUR SON CREATED HIM.

39:49.920 --> 39:52.738
DAD, SHUT UP.

39:52.740 --> 39:54.806
I DID IT, OKAY?
FOR YOU.

39:54.808 --> 39:57.059
(Stanford) THIS IS OFF THE RECORD.
NONE OF THIS IS ADMISSIBLE.

39:57.061 --> 39:58.828
SO THE SCHOOL COULD BE
WHAT IT WAS WHEN YOU WENT THERE.

39:58.830 --> 40:00.512
THAT'S ENOUGH. <i>(Stanford) JACK.</i>

40:00.514 --> 40:02.281
SHUT YOUR MOUTH, STANFORD.

40:02.283 --> 40:04.183

YOU'RE A TOOL TOO.

40:04.185 --> 40:07.419
HE WOULD NEVER LET YOU TAKE
ANYTHING TO TRIAL.

40:12.742 --> 40:15.311
THERE IS NO JOE.

40:15.313 --> 40:16.645
I DID IT ALL.

40:16.647 --> 40:18.915
HE'S JUST SAYING THIS
TO GET ATTENTION.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.616
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

40:20.618 --> 40:26.005
I ALMOST HAD TESS
STRIPPING FOR JOE ON WEBCAM.

40:26.007 --> 40:28.407
BUT SHE SAID NO.

40:28.409 --> 40:30.326

40:30.328 --> 40:31.661
<i>(Eames)</i>
<i>THAT'S WHEN YOU TOLD HER</i>

40:31.663 --> 40:33.596

40:33.598 --> 40:35.948
WELL, IT WASN'T LIKE
HE WAS GONNA SHOW UP

40:35.950 --> 40:39.151
TO THE PROM, NOW WAS IT?

40:39.153 --> 40:42.788
PAUL WAS.
HE WAS WAITING FOR TESSA.

40:44.390 --> 40:45.991
HOW DID YOU HANDLE THAT?

40:45.993 --> 40:50.145
YEAH, WELL,
I HAD TO SCRAMBLE.

40:50.147 --> 40:52.147
I KNEW KIANA HAD A CRUSH
ON TESS.

40:52.149 --> 40:55.885
SO I PLAYED HER
AGAINST PAUL.

40:55.887 --> 40:57.553
AND THAT WORKED TOO, DAD.

40:57.555 --> 41:00.339
THOSE GIRLS...
THIS IS SO DARWINIAN.

41:00.341 --> 41:04.593
THOSE GIRLS BEAT THE CRAP
OUT OF HIM

41:04.595 --> 41:06.262
AND VIDEOTAPED IT.

41:11.901 --> 41:15.054
AND THEN PAUL STRUCK BACK
WITH HIS VIDEO.

41:15.056 --> 41:17.556
DUMB GEEK.

41:17.558 --> 41:19.391
I TOLD HIM NOT TO.

YOU, UH, UH, YOU
DIDN'T ATTACK PAUL, DID YOU?

41:29.737 --> 41:33.773
I DIDN'T ATTACK PAUL.

41:33.775 --> 41:35.174
HE CAME AT ME.

41:36.943 --> 41:39.245
BECAUSE HE REALIZED
YOU'D RUINED THINGS WITH TESSA

41:39.247 --> 41:40.646

JUST ONE LITTLE SHOVE
