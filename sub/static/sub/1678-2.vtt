00:12.800 --> 00:14.360
Okay, where was I?

00:14.400 --> 00:15.760
You were telling us how you met Mom.

00:15.800 --> 00:17.560
In excruciating detail.

00:17.680 --> 00:23.040
Right. So, back in 2005, when I was 27, my two best friends got engaged,

00:23.160 --> 00:25.640
and it got me thinking, maybe I should get married.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.560
And then I saw Robin.

00:27.880 --> 00:29.360
She was incredible.

00:29.440 --> 00:31.120
I just knew I had to meet her.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.080
That's where your Uncle Barney came in.

00:33.160 --> 00:36.400
I suggest we play a little game I like to call "Have you met Ted?"

00:36.480 --> 00:38.160
Wait, no, no, no. We're not playing "Have you met Ted?"

00:38.240 --> 00:39.680
Hi. Have you met Ted?

00:41.160 --> 00:42.480
So I asked her out.

00:42.560 --> 00:45.080
And I know this sound crazy, but after just one date,

00:45.160 --> 00:48.120
I was in love with her which made me say something stupid.

00:48.240 --> 00:49.680
I think I'm in love with you.

00:49.760 --> 00:50.560
What?!

00:50.640 --> 00:51.760
Oh, Dad.

00:52.600 --> 00:54.080
So then what happened?

00:54.600 --> 00:55.640
Nothing.

00:55.840 --> 00:58.120
I mean, I'd made a complete fool of myself.

00:58.280 --> 01:01.240
So, a week went by, and I decided not to call her.

01:01.280 --> 01:02.720
So you're not gonna call her?

01:02.800 --> 01:05.600
You went from, "I think I'm in love with you" to "I'm not gonna call her"?

01:05.640 --> 01:06.880
I wasn't in love with her, okay?

01:06.920 --> 01:10.200
I was briefly in love with the abstract concept of getting married.

01:10.240 --> 01:12.200
It had absolutely nothing to do with Robin.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.040
- Robin.
- Hi.

01:14.120 --> 01:15.400
Look who I ran into.

01:15.480 --> 01:16.920
Since when do you guys know each other?

01:17.000 --> 01:19.160
Oh, since about... here.

01:19.760 --> 01:21.920
Lily recognized me from the news and...

01:22.120 --> 01:23.400
Hello, sailor!

01:23.520 --> 01:24.840
They just got engaged.

01:26.160 --> 01:28.120
Well, I should get back to the station.

01:28.360 --> 01:29.640
See you, guys.

01:31.280 --> 01:33.480
- Nice seeing you, Ted.
- Yeah, you, too.

01:35.720 --> 01:36.800
- Dawn it!
- What?

01:36.880 --> 01:39.240
- I'm in love with her.
- No!

01:39.560 --> 01:42.000
As your sponsor, I will not let you relapse.

01:42.040 --> 01:43.360
You blew it, it's over, move on.

01:43.440 --> 01:47.840
I don't know, I just have this feeling she's the future Mrs. Ted Mosby.

01:49.240 --> 01:50.720
Lily, you squeaked?

01:50.960 --> 01:52.360
She said something about me, didn't she?

01:52.440 --> 01:54.000
Come on, spill it, Red!

01:54.120 --> 01:55.080
Fine.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.200
So, what do we think of Ted?

01:58.880 --> 02:00.600
Ted's something else.

02:00.680 --> 02:01.600
Huh.

02:01.720 --> 02:03.120
I'm gonna spin that as good.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.640
Lots of guys are something, I'm something else.

02:05.720 --> 02:07.320
Comes on a little strong.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.720
But, that's part of my charm.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.480
But, that's part of his charm.

02:11.560 --> 02:13.760
Oh, totally. I mean, he's sweet, he's charming,

02:13.840 --> 02:16.920
he's just looking for something a little bit more serious than I am.

02:16.960 --> 02:19.640
I mean, the most I can handle right now is something casual.

02:20.280 --> 02:22.040
This just stays between us, right?

02:22.120 --> 02:23.200
Are you kidding?

02:23.280 --> 02:25.640
This flapper? Fort Knox.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.200
Oops.

02:27.880 --> 02:29.320
She wants casual.

02:29.560 --> 02:31.600
Okay, I'll be casual.

02:31.680 --> 02:34.520
I'm going to be a mushroom cloud of casual.

02:34.600 --> 02:35.560
You know why?

02:35.640 --> 02:36.760
Cause it's a game--

02:36.840 --> 02:39.400
I want her to skip to the end and do the whole happily-ever-after thing.

02:39.440 --> 02:41.960
But you don't get there unless you play the game.

02:42.040 --> 02:43.280
So, are you going to ask her out?

02:43.360 --> 02:44.680
Yeah... No!

02:44.760 --> 02:48.400
I can't ask her out, because if I ask her out, I'm asking her out.

02:48.480 --> 02:52.120
So, how do I ask her out without asking her out?

02:55.440 --> 02:57.200
Did you guys get high?

02:57.920 --> 02:58.760
I got it.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.160
I don't ask her out.

03:00.280 --> 03:03.360
I invite her to our party next Friday.

03:03.440 --> 03:04.800
We're having a party next Friday?

03:04.880 --> 03:05.960
We are now.

03:06.080 --> 03:07.080
Casual.

03:07.240 --> 03:11.240
Yeah, cause nothing says "casual" like inviting a hundred people over just to mack on one girl.

03:11.280 --> 03:13.640
Oh, and Lily, that's my leg.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.560
You waited five minutes to tell me that?

03:18.600 --> 03:19.800
All right, so call her up.

03:19.880 --> 03:21.640
No, calling's not casual.

03:21.720 --> 03:23.440
I just got to bump into her somewhere.

03:23.480 --> 03:26.600
Now, if only I knew her schedule, I could arrange a chance encounter.

03:26.640 --> 03:30.040
That's great, Ted-- you'll be the most casual stalker ever.

03:32.760 --> 03:35.160
Ever since Marshall put that ring on her finger,

03:35.240 --> 03:39.320
Lily had been, well, extra affectionate.

03:39.440 --> 03:41.360
Baby, no.

03:41.440 --> 03:44.440
I have a 25-page paper on constitutional law due Monday.

03:44.480 --> 03:45.760
I barely started.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.560
Hey, I'm just sitting here,

03:47.920 --> 03:49.560
wearing my ring,

03:49.760 --> 03:51.960
my beautiful ring.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.040
Kind of makes wearing other stuff seem wrong.

03:56.440 --> 03:57.840
Like my shirt.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.720
Kind of don't want to wear my shirt anymore.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.080
Or... my underwear.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.960
That's right, I'm not wearing any.

04:09.520 --> 04:10.840
No underwear?

04:10.920 --> 04:12.720
Not even slightly.

04:12.800 --> 04:13.800
Guys.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.680
Boundaries.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.200
There she is.

04:19.279 --> 04:20.079
Thanks, Bill.

04:20.200 --> 04:24.480
I'm reporting from the Razzle Dazzle Supermarket on 75th and Columbus...

04:24.560 --> 04:26.200
75th and Columbus.

04:27.280 --> 04:28.560
Game on!

04:29.000 --> 04:34.480
...where four-year-old Leroy Ellenberg has climbed inside a grab-a-prize machine and gotten stuck.

04:37.480 --> 04:40.680
And, all in the pursuit of a stuffed, purple giraffe.

04:41.040 --> 04:44.040
For Metro News 1, I'm Robin Trubotsky.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.080
We're clear.

04:45.240 --> 04:46.400
Thanks, Don.

04:47.440 --> 04:48.160
Ted.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.560
Robin, wow!

04:50.680 --> 04:51.640
What are the odds?

04:51.760 --> 04:52.760
What are you doing here?

04:52.840 --> 04:56.200
Oh, you know, just, uh, shopping for, uh, dip.

04:56.320 --> 04:57.440
I love dip.

04:57.560 --> 05:00.480
I mean, I don't love dip, I like dip... as a friend, you know.

05:01.160 --> 05:03.840
So, uh, hey, you, uh, reporting a news story or something?

05:03.920 --> 05:05.520
Yeah, kid stuck in a crane machine.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.400
How sweet of you to call it news.

05:07.480 --> 05:10.040
Wow. Kid in a crane machine.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.960
You just had to have that toy, didn't you?

05:12.040 --> 05:13.640
Couldn't play the game like everyone else.

05:13.720 --> 05:15.200
You're all sweaty!

05:15.800 --> 05:16.640
Cute kid.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.640
Um, you know, it's so funny I should run into you.

05:18.680 --> 05:21.920
We're, uh, we're having a party next Friday, if you feel like swinging by.

05:21.960 --> 05:23.880
But, you know, whatever.

05:23.920 --> 05:26.000
Oh, I'm going back home next weekend.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.680
It's too bad it's not tonight.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.360
It is... it's tonight.

05:29.440 --> 05:31.040
This Friday. Did I say next Friday?

05:31.120 --> 05:33.680
Sorry, I guess I've been saying next Friday all week.

05:33.720 --> 05:35.760
But, yeah, it's tonight, the, uh, the party's tonight.

05:35.840 --> 05:38.080
But, you know, whatever.

05:43.520 --> 05:44.320
Hello?

05:44.360 --> 05:46.240
Hey, am I interrupting anything?

05:46.320 --> 05:48.320
No, no, I'm just writing my paper.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.560
Hitting the books.

05:49.680 --> 05:52.640
Yeah, well, you and Lily might want to put some clothes on.

05:52.840 --> 05:54.240
We're throwing a party in two hours.

05:54.280 --> 05:55.360
Okay, bye.

05:59.520 --> 06:01.840
So, Gatsby, what are you gonna do when Robin shows up?

06:01.880 --> 06:04.560
Okay, I got it all planned out.

06:05.080 --> 06:07.920
She steps through the door-- and where's Ted?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.120
Not eagerly waiting by the door.

06:10.280 --> 06:12.440
No, I'm across the room at my drafting table,

06:12.520 --> 06:16.120
showing some foxy young thing all my cool architect stuff.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.760
So, Robin strolls over,

06:17.880 --> 06:22.000
and I casually give her one of these: "Hey, what's up?"

06:22.040 --> 06:25.800
She says, "Hey, nice place, et cetera, et cetera."

06:25.880 --> 06:27.320
And then, I say,

06:27.360 --> 06:29.040
"Well, make yourself at home."

06:29.120 --> 06:31.720
And, I casually return to my conversation.

06:31.880 --> 06:33.760
Then, an hour later...

06:34.640 --> 06:37.800
"Oh, you're still here?" I say,

06:37.880 --> 06:40.680
like I don't really care, but it's a nice surprise.

06:40.760 --> 06:42.440
And then, very casually:

06:43.080 --> 06:45.120
"Want to see the roof?"

06:46.240 --> 06:47.440
The roof!

06:47.520 --> 06:50.080
Get her up to the roof, and the roof takes care of the rest.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.480
What's so special about the roof?

06:51.560 --> 06:55.080
Oh, the moon, the stars, the shimmering skyline.

06:55.160 --> 06:57.800
You can't not fall in love on that roof.

06:58.840 --> 07:00.720
We do it up there, sometimes.

07:01.040 --> 07:02.880
Solid plan, my little friend.

07:02.920 --> 07:03.840
We're the same height.

07:03.880 --> 07:07.040
But, may I suggest one little modification.

07:07.600 --> 07:11.000
That foxy young thing you were chatting up, take her up to the roof and have sex with her.

07:11.040 --> 07:13.160
- Crazy monkey style...
- That's not the plan.

07:13.240 --> 07:14.840
Well, it should be the plan. I mean, look at her.

07:14.880 --> 07:17.360
Ted, look at her. She's smoking!

07:17.400 --> 07:18.960
- Thank you!
- Yeah...

07:19.040 --> 07:20.560
But, she's not Robin!

07:20.600 --> 07:21.760
Exactly!

07:21.840 --> 07:23.240
Ted, let's rap.

07:23.560 --> 07:28.040
Statistic: At every New York party, there's always a girl who has no idea whose party she's at.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.960
She knows no one you know, and you will never see her again.

07:31.040 --> 07:35.280
Do you see where I'm going with this?

07:35.360 --> 07:36.960
Barney, I don't think so.

07:37.040 --> 07:37.960
Scoping.

07:38.600 --> 07:39.840
Scoping.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.680
Man, you're a dork.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.040
Target acquired!

07:44.120 --> 07:47.520
Now it's time we play a little game I like to call "Have you met Ted?"

07:47.600 --> 07:48.800
Oh, come on, not this.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.040
Hi. Have you met Ted?

07:50.120 --> 07:50.720
No.

07:50.800 --> 07:51.880
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.720
- Do you know Marshall? Lily?
- No.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.600
Hmm. Do you know anyone at this party?

07:55.720 --> 07:57.200
I work with Carlos.

07:57.440 --> 07:58.360
Excuse me.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.960
Anyone know a Carlos?

08:00.160 --> 08:01.040
- No.
- No.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.800
On a silver platter.

08:03.080 --> 08:04.800
Bon appétit.

08:04.880 --> 08:06.200
I don't think so.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.200
Your loss, her gain.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.200
Excuse me.

08:09.360 --> 08:11.640
Can I show you the roof? It's magical up there.

08:11.720 --> 08:12.560
- Sure.
- Wait, wait.

08:12.640 --> 08:13.920
Hey, hey, I got that roof reserved.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.320
Dude, Robin's not coming.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.360
Hey, she's going to show up!

08:20.400 --> 08:21.520
She'll show up.

08:21.880 --> 08:23.280
She didn't show up.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.600
At least it was a great party.

08:26.920 --> 08:29.040
I ate, like, four whole cans of dip.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.840
You always know what to say, old friend.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.080
It's Robin.

08:37.440 --> 08:38.240
Answer it.

08:38.320 --> 08:40.520
No, no, not right away-- got to seem casual.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.039
Hello?

08:43.080 --> 08:45.160
I'm so sorry I missed your party.

08:45.280 --> 08:46.600
Who is this? Meredith?

08:47.240 --> 08:48.120
Robin.

08:48.240 --> 08:49.640
Oh, Robin!

08:49.720 --> 08:53.080
Hey! Yeah, I, uh, guess you never showed up, did you?

08:53.160 --> 08:54.240
No, I got stuck at work.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.680
But, they finally got that kid out of the crane machine.

08:56.760 --> 08:58.440
Did he get to keep the purple giraffe?

08:58.520 --> 09:00.760
Yeah, they let him keep all the toys.

09:00.840 --> 09:04.320
He was in there a long time, and little kids have small bladders.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.000
I wish your party was tonight.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.480
It is-- the party's tonight.

09:11.360 --> 09:14.920
Yeah, uh... it's a two-day party, 'cause that's just how we roll.

09:15.960 --> 09:19.680
Uh, so, if you want to swing by, you know, it's casual.

09:19.760 --> 09:20.640
See ya.

09:24.360 --> 09:25.440
So, that was Robin.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.600
What are you doing to me, man?! I got a paper to write!

09:27.680 --> 09:29.240
I know! Sorry! It's terrible!

09:29.600 --> 09:32.160
- I'll buy more dip!
- Ted! Ted, wait!

09:33.080 --> 09:34.840
Get French onion!

09:38.880 --> 09:41.080
Can you believe this guy? I got a paper to write.

09:42.880 --> 09:43.880
Okay, fine.

09:43.920 --> 09:47.520
But, it's got to be, like, super-quick, and no cuddling after.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.960
I'm the luckiest girl alive.

09:53.600 --> 09:56.040
You were so right about the roof!

09:56.080 --> 09:57.280
The roof!

09:57.400 --> 10:00.600
The roof is on fire, Ted!

10:00.800 --> 10:02.880
That girl from last night-- I took her back to my place,

10:02.920 --> 10:05.160
then this morning, took her outside, spun her around a couple times

10:05.240 --> 10:09.560
and sent her walking. She will never find her way back, and there she is.

10:10.440 --> 10:11.640
How did she get here? Did you invite her?

10:11.680 --> 10:12.720
I have no idea who that is.

10:12.760 --> 10:14.280
She said she works with Carlos. Who's Carlos?

10:14.360 --> 10:15.720
I don't know any Carlos.

10:16.160 --> 10:18.120
Hi, you!

10:18.160 --> 10:19.040
You're back!

10:19.120 --> 10:20.280
I sure am.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.320
Come on, sweetie, I need a drink.

10:24.400 --> 10:25.840
"Sweetie"? Really?

10:29.040 --> 10:30.800
Whoa! Whoa, rabbits!

10:30.840 --> 10:32.840
Come on, I got that roof reserved.

10:33.000 --> 10:33.800
All right.

10:35.040 --> 10:38.360
So, it's over between me and works-with-Carlos girl.

10:38.400 --> 10:39.640
Whoa! That was fast.

10:39.720 --> 10:44.720
Yeah. I was trying to think, what's the quickest way to get rid of a girl you just met?

10:45.040 --> 10:46.560
I think I'm in love with you.

10:46.680 --> 10:47.400
What?!

10:47.520 --> 10:48.520
Thanks, bro.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.000
Glad I could help.

10:51.920 --> 10:52.600
What the...

10:52.680 --> 10:54.400
No, no, no. Come on.

10:54.560 --> 10:55.840
Sorry, Ted.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.840
Great. What am I going to do when Robin shows up?

11:00.160 --> 11:01.600
She'll show up.

11:01.880 --> 11:03.240
She didn't show up.

11:04.120 --> 11:06.520
All right. We threw two parties.

11:06.640 --> 11:08.200
Everybody had fun.

11:08.320 --> 11:11.000
Everybody wanged, everybody chunged.

11:11.560 --> 11:14.960
Now, the kid has got to get to work, and the kid is not to be disturbed.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.200
Repeat after me.

11:16.280 --> 11:18.400
I will not have sex with Marshall.

11:18.480 --> 11:21.160
I will not have sex with Marshall.

11:24.000 --> 11:24.960
It's Robin.

11:27.080 --> 11:27.840
Hello?

11:27.920 --> 11:29.240
- Hi, Ted.
- Amanda?

11:29.320 --> 11:32.640
Oh, Denise! Sorry, you totally sounded like Amanda.

11:32.760 --> 11:33.480
It's Robin.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.560
Oh, Robin.

11:35.040 --> 11:35.720
Hi.

11:35.960 --> 11:40.200
I totally wanted to come. I got stuck at work again. I feel like I live there.

11:40.280 --> 11:42.160
I'm sorry I missed your party, again.

11:42.240 --> 11:45.280
Hey, ain't no thing but a chicken wing, mamacita.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.800
Who am I?

11:47.560 --> 11:50.880
I guess there's no chance your two-dayer turned into a three-dayer?

11:51.600 --> 11:53.960
It did, indeed. The party continues tonight.

11:54.120 --> 11:58.840
Yeah. Uh, last night, people were like, "Keep it going, bro. Party trifecta."

11:58.920 --> 12:01.280
Wow! Okay, well, I'll be there.

12:01.360 --> 12:03.240
Great! See you tonight.

12:06.120 --> 12:07.520
So, that was Robin.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.920
So, I threw a third party for Robin...

12:12.160 --> 12:13.800
on a Sunday night.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.160
Well, this is lame.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.160
Lame...

12:17.600 --> 12:18.920
or casual?

12:19.280 --> 12:20.280
Lame.

12:20.480 --> 12:21.760
Or casual?

12:22.960 --> 12:24.520
Hey, law books.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.760
Ready for a little 15 minute recess?

12:26.800 --> 12:30.320
Sorry, baby, I got to work. I need all my blood up here.

12:30.440 --> 12:36.880
Has anybody seen An Introduction to Contract Tort and Restitution Statutes from 1865-1923?

12:38.120 --> 12:39.840
Anybody seen a big-ass book?

12:40.640 --> 12:41.320
No.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.000
Hello, Barney.

12:44.120 --> 12:46.000
Of course.

12:47.640 --> 12:48.720
You look well.

12:49.160 --> 12:51.160
Is it weird they invited both of us?

12:51.720 --> 12:53.080
Who?

12:53.800 --> 12:57.480
Who invited you? No one even knows who you are!

12:58.200 --> 13:00.080
I understand you're hurt, but

13:00.520 --> 13:02.000
you don't have to be cruel.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.480
Carlos was right about you.

13:05.760 --> 13:07.920
Who is Carlos?!

13:08.000 --> 13:09.720
Hey, where the hell is my...?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.160
Oh...!

13:13.960 --> 13:14.920
Okay...

13:16.160 --> 13:21.720
An Introduction to Contract Tort and Restitution Statutes from 1865-1923

13:21.800 --> 13:23.600
is not a coaster!

13:23.680 --> 13:27.160
Ted, I'm jeopardizing my law career so you can throw not one,

13:27.240 --> 13:29.400
not two, but three parties

13:29.440 --> 13:32.600
for some girl that you just met who's probably not even going to show up!

13:32.680 --> 13:34.000
I mean, where is she, Ted, huh?

13:34.120 --> 13:35.360
Where's Robin?

13:37.320 --> 13:38.080
Hi.

13:38.720 --> 13:39.720
Hi, Ron.

13:48.080 --> 13:51.360
So, you threw all these parties for me?

13:51.640 --> 13:54.040
No. Oh, you thought that... no!

13:54.120 --> 13:56.040
I... okay, yes. You got me.

13:56.200 --> 14:00.640
One of the reasons I threw these parties was so that I could introduce you

14:00.720 --> 14:02.960
to, um, this guy.

14:03.040 --> 14:06.080
Uh, I figured, you know, since it didn't work out between us

14:06.160 --> 14:07.880
and now we can just laugh about it...

14:09.240 --> 14:11.400
Anyway, Robin, this is...

14:11.560 --> 14:12.520
Carlos.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.560
- Oh!
- Oh!

14:17.920 --> 14:19.640
She's still talking to Carlos.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.240
I can still win this. I-it's not over.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.920
Okay, buddy. Time for the tough talk.

14:25.080 --> 14:27.760
Robin seems great, but let's look at the facts.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.200
You want to get married.

14:29.240 --> 14:33.560
And right now, there's a million women in New York looking for exactly you.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.040
But Robin ain't one of them.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.680
She's not just one of them. She's the one.

14:37.760 --> 14:40.760
Yeah, well, the one is heading up to the roof.

14:43.280 --> 14:44.640
What are you going to do?

14:45.480 --> 14:46.360
Nothing.

14:46.680 --> 14:50.120
It's a game. I got to just keep playing it.

15:27.400 --> 15:28.280
Ted...

15:28.360 --> 15:30.440
Hey, Carlos, can you give us a minute?

15:30.480 --> 15:32.440
Hey, no sweat, hombre.

15:33.160 --> 15:33.960
See ya.

15:37.640 --> 15:38.520
Robin...

15:38.760 --> 15:41.480
look, I didn't throw this party to set you up with Carlos,

15:41.560 --> 15:42.760
or the one before that,

15:43.160 --> 15:44.480
or the one before that.

15:45.760 --> 15:48.320
I threw these parties because I wanted to see you.

15:49.320 --> 15:50.720
Well, here I am.

15:52.040 --> 15:54.960
There's something here, look, unless I'm crazy.

15:55.440 --> 15:57.040
You're not crazy.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.080
I don't know, Ted.

16:00.120 --> 16:02.200
I mean, we barely know each other

16:02.400 --> 16:05.360
and you're looking at me with that look. And, it's like...

16:05.480 --> 16:06.240
Like, like what?

16:06.320 --> 16:09.120
Like, "Let's fall in love and get married

16:09.160 --> 16:11.440
and have kids and drive them to soccer practice."

16:11.520 --> 16:13.960
I'm not going to force sports on them unless they're interested.

16:15.560 --> 16:16.840
It's a great look.

16:17.480 --> 16:18.920
But you're looking at the wrong girl.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.600
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.160
I don't want to get married right now, maybe ever.

16:23.240 --> 16:29.400
And, if we got together, I'd feel like I'd either have to marry you or break your heart, and...

16:30.240 --> 16:32.920
I just couldn't do either of those things.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.880
Just like you can't turn off the way you feel.

16:39.120 --> 16:40.200
Click.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.840
Off. Let's make out.

16:42.000 --> 16:42.920
What?

16:43.680 --> 16:45.800
What? That was the off switch.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.320
And I turned it off.

16:47.520 --> 16:51.400
I mean, look, sure, yes, I want to fall in love, get married, blah, blah, blah.

16:51.440 --> 16:55.480
But, on the other hand... you, me,

16:56.160 --> 16:57.480
the roof.

16:58.760 --> 17:00.240
There's no off switch.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.640
There is an off switch.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.720
And it's off.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.400
No, it's not.

17:07.400 --> 17:08.880
Yes, it is.

17:09.440 --> 17:10.720
No, it's not.

17:10.760 --> 17:13.680
Yes... it is.

17:27.319 --> 17:28.560
No, it's not.

17:29.360 --> 17:31.720
You're right. There's no off switch.

17:33.040 --> 17:35.040
God, I wish there was an off switch!

17:35.800 --> 17:37.040
Me, too.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.960
So, um...

17:45.200 --> 17:46.680
What do we do now?

17:49.280 --> 17:50.640
We could be friends.

17:50.880 --> 17:52.040
Oh...

17:53.360 --> 17:57.880
Look, I know it sounds insincere when people say that, but...

17:58.480 --> 17:59.520
we could.

18:00.320 --> 18:01.760
I don't know, Robin.

18:01.920 --> 18:03.560
I've made such a jackass of myself here.

18:03.640 --> 18:07.760
We start hanging out, every time I see you it'll be like, "Oh, that's right. I'm a jackass."

18:08.120 --> 18:09.440
You're not a jackass.

18:10.040 --> 18:12.240
Look, I'm sorry. I only moved here in April

18:12.320 --> 18:14.720
and I'm always working and

18:14.960 --> 18:17.960
I just haven't met a lot of good people so far.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.640
But I understand.

18:22.080 --> 18:26.560
Well, uh, maybe in a few months, after it's not so fresh,

18:26.640 --> 18:30.400
we could all, uh, you know, get a beer.

18:30.920 --> 18:31.960
Yeah.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.240
That sounds good.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.040
I'll see you, Ted.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.920
Or, you know, now.

18:47.480 --> 18:49.920
We could all get a beer now.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.040
I'd like that.

18:56.440 --> 19:00.600
My friends are going to love you... like you, you know, as a friend.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.120
Jackass.

19:05.760 --> 19:07.120
Unbelievable.

19:07.640 --> 19:10.640
That's just a recipe for disaster. They work together!

19:10.720 --> 19:11.560
Are you jealous?

19:11.640 --> 19:14.800
Oh, please. What does Carlos have that I don't?

19:14.800 --> 19:17.000
- A date tonight.
- Oh!

19:17.080 --> 19:18.920
Stop the tape. Rewind. Play it again.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.800
- A date tonight.
- Oh!

19:21.960 --> 19:23.200
I'm not sure I like her.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.560
Hey, don't you have a paper to write?

19:25.640 --> 19:28.080
- Dude, you're talking to the kid.
- I know it.

19:28.120 --> 19:29.640
I'm going to knock back this beer.

19:29.720 --> 19:31.520
I'm going to knock back one more beer.

19:31.560 --> 19:34.400
I'm going to go home. I'm going to write a 25-page paper.

19:34.480 --> 19:36.600
I'm going to hand it in and I'm going to get an "A."

19:36.640 --> 19:39.920
My name is Rufus and that's the trufus.

19:40.320 --> 19:41.640
He got a B-minus.

19:41.720 --> 19:44.600
But still, 25 pages in one night, B-minus?

19:44.640 --> 19:45.920
The kid was good.

19:46.440 --> 19:48.120
At least let me buy you a beer.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.720
Come on, I'll buy everyone a beer.

19:49.800 --> 19:50.800
I'll help carry.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.160
- You know something Ted?
- What?

19:57.200 --> 19:58.400
You are a catch.

19:58.480 --> 20:00.920
You're going to make some girl very happy.

20:01.080 --> 20:03.760
And I am going to help you find her.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.680
Well, good luck.

20:05.960 --> 20:07.840
I mean, maybe New York's just too big a town.

20:07.880 --> 20:09.840
I mean, there's millions of people in this city.

20:09.960 --> 20:12.920
How, in all this mess, is a guy supposed to find the love of his life?

20:13.000 --> 20:15.440
I mean, where do you even begin?

20:17.920 --> 20:20.240
Hi. Have you met Ted?
