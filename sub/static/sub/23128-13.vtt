WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:02.989
- Previously on Being Human...

00:03.100 --> 00:04.590
I don't think
I have much longer.

00:04.630 --> 00:07.133
- You have to fight!
- You've seen Donna.

00:07.240 --> 00:08.435
That's an unnatural power.

00:08.540 --> 00:09.439
Aaah!

00:09.540 --> 00:11.406
- Sally's heart
iS our weapon.

00:11.510 --> 00:13.478
- I love you.

00:17.410 --> 00:19.276
- No!

00:19.380 --> 00:21.519
- (Josh): No!

00:21.620 --> 00:24.214
(Screaming)

00:24.320 --> 00:25.014
Is she here?

00:25.120 --> 00:27.259
- We won?

00:27.360 --> 00:28.850
- (Kenny)
I want you to turn me.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.724
- It's not what
you think it is.

00:30.830 --> 00:34.095
There's a vaccine for
the virus. Werewolf blood.

00:34.200 --> 00:34.792
- Tell me!

00:34.900 --> 00:35.560
(Groans)

00:35.660 --> 00:37.219
- I killed
your daughter.

00:37.330 --> 00:38.764
(Growling)

00:38.870 --> 00:40.531
- Aaah!

00:40.640 --> 00:42.199
- I love you!

00:42.310 --> 00:44.460
- (Josh) Life is just a
series of accidents.

00:44.570 --> 00:48.200
And one of those accidents
led me to you.

00:48.310 --> 00:51.280
- My best wishes
to the bride.

00:54.950 --> 00:56.884
- You can't
be here.

00:56.990 --> 00:57.889
I don't know
what you want,

00:57.990 --> 00:59.082
but you need
to leave.

00:59.190 --> 01:01.158
- Is everything
all right?

01:03.260 --> 01:05.649
You need to get out
of here right now!

01:05.760 --> 01:09.492
- We didn't leave things
on a very good note, I agree.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.625
- I'll call the police,
I swear to God.

01:11.730 --> 01:13.164
Did you follow us here?

01:13.270 --> 01:15.193
- There's something
you need to know

01:15.300 --> 01:17.564
about this life
you've chosen to live.

01:17.670 --> 01:18.660
- We've moved on.

01:18.770 --> 01:20.238
We just got married!

01:20.340 --> 01:23.844
- All the more reason
to protect your family.

01:23.950 --> 01:25.679
I've made my peace
with your desire

01:25.780 --> 01:27.817
to commingle
with the vampires

01:27.920 --> 01:30.582
but this connection
you've made with your blood,

01:30.690 --> 01:32.784
it's deadly.

01:32.890 --> 01:34.710
- Because of how
it cures the virus?

01:34.820 --> 01:36.322
- It's not a cure.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.524
It's a curse.

01:38.630 --> 01:39.722
You need to
come with me.

01:39.830 --> 01:40.900
- Aw, go to hell.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.493
- If you want to keep
your loved ones safe,

01:44.600 --> 01:46.830
if you want to
keep humans safe,

01:46.940 --> 01:49.910
you will come with me
right now.

02:00.850 --> 02:03.490
- Mmm!

02:03.590 --> 02:05.149
(Giggles)

02:05.250 --> 02:06.809
(Sighing)

02:06.920 --> 02:09.321
Are you confusing
this with mistletoe?

02:09.430 --> 02:11.159
- Mmm!

02:11.260 --> 02:13.228
Um...

02:13.330 --> 02:16.300
Did you know that
mistletoe is actually a...

02:19.570 --> 02:20.969
It's a parasitic bush

02:21.070 --> 02:23.767
that the Celts just decided
was a charm for fertility.

02:23.870 --> 02:24.769
- Mmm!

02:24.870 --> 02:28.477
- Think it was the 16th Century.
- Yeah.

02:28.580 --> 02:31.277
(Whooshing)

02:31.380 --> 02:34.213
- So this is it?
This is how you close a deal?

02:34.320 --> 02:36.186
Is this your move?
Bush talk?

02:36.290 --> 02:37.382
- What do I do?

02:37.490 --> 02:39.356
- Oh, you want privacy?

02:39.460 --> 02:40.279
- Oh, no, no, no.

02:40.390 --> 02:41.357
(Sighing)

02:41.460 --> 02:43.326
- Being invisible sucks.

02:43.430 --> 02:44.579
(Whooshing)

02:44.690 --> 02:46.351
- Hey.

02:46.460 --> 02:48.326
It's been a
really long day

02:48.430 --> 02:50.899
and if you're tired,
I totally understand.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.331
(Chuckling)

02:52.440 --> 02:53.862
- You're kicking
me out again?

02:53.970 --> 02:54.960
- No!

02:55.070 --> 02:56.560
- I'm running out of ways

02:56.670 --> 02:59.207
to justify your girlish
need for privacy.

02:59.310 --> 03:01.904
- No, listen, I am not
kicking you out.

03:02.010 --> 03:04.399
It's just I'm...

03:04.510 --> 03:08.469
*¥*x ..and I'm trying
to resist *

03:09.950 --> 03:11.679
* But I like it

03:11.790 --> 03:13.815
* So much

03:13.920 --> 03:15.888
* Oh yes, I like it

03:15.990 --> 03:18.960
* So much *

03:24.730 --> 03:27.734
- I know I did
the right thing...

03:29.710 --> 03:32.702
fighting Donna,
letting you die.

03:38.250 --> 03:40.241
Well, the right thing sucks.

03:42.350 --> 03:45.741
I mean, I could've
eaten, like, one person,

03:45.850 --> 03:49.787
one person, like
a criminal or something

03:49.890 --> 03:52.029
or someone who was
terminally ill.

03:52.130 --> 03:55.498
I could've done
someone a favour.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.898
I could've done
you and me a favour.

04:02.910 --> 04:03.900
(Sighing)

04:07.740 --> 04:09.742
I would only
tell you that.

04:16.519 --> 04:17.442
- Do you have your phone?

04:17.550 --> 04:18.880
- No.

04:18.990 --> 04:20.185
- We should call Aidan.

04:20.290 --> 04:22.019
- No, we're not
bringing him into this.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.258
- I get it, OK?

04:23.360 --> 04:26.421
I just would feel better if
someone knew where we were.

04:26.530 --> 04:28.692
He didn't bring us
all the way out here

04:28.800 --> 04:30.768
to give us
a rice maker.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.636
- A few days ago,
I followed some vampires

04:39.740 --> 04:43.074
who had killed
members of my pack.

04:43.180 --> 04:44.477
(Liam sighing)

04:44.580 --> 04:46.344
I wanted revenge.

04:46.450 --> 04:48.919
I wasn't expecting this.

04:53.020 --> 04:55.489
- What is this?

04:55.590 --> 04:58.423
- They're incubating.

04:58.530 --> 05:02.125
This is what your relationship
with the leeches creates.

05:02.230 --> 05:03.994
They drink wolf's blood,

05:04.100 --> 05:07.695
and those they turn,
turn into these.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.269
- Our blood causes
this defect?

05:10.370 --> 05:13.010
- They cause the defect.

05:13.110 --> 05:16.842
It wasn't enough that they use
our blood to save themselves.

05:16.950 --> 05:20.648
They had to get greedy and spawn
a whole new breed of monsters

05:20.750 --> 05:23.845
who feed on children
without a thought.

05:23.950 --> 05:26.009
You're here to help me
get rid of them.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.680
Unless in your grand
moral scheme of things

05:28.790 --> 05:30.758
you can justify this.

05:48.940 --> 05:50.169
(Sighing)

05:50.280 --> 05:54.171
(* Ryan Adams - Wonderwall )

05:54.280 --> 05:56.817
- You look real
proud of yourself.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.217
- What?

05:58.320 --> 06:00.379
I am, actually.

06:00.490 --> 06:01.480
(Chuckling)

06:01.590 --> 06:03.024
- Yeah, you should be.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.019
(Sighing)

06:05.130 --> 06:08.828
So, is Nora pregnant?

06:08.930 --> 06:09.761
- What?

06:10.700 --> 06:11.189
- I thought I could
catch you off guard

06:11.930 --> 06:12.897
if I asked you
out of the blue!

06:13.000 --> 06:13.899
- No!

06:14.000 --> 06:15.729
- Come on! The wedding
was so shotgun!

06:15.840 --> 06:18.400
- It was not.
OK, it was a little bit, but--

06:18.510 --> 06:19.773
- Are they on the lam?
- No!

06:19.880 --> 06:23.077
- Did they rob a bank?
- No, they didn't.

06:23.180 --> 06:28.141
- I think they just wanted to
do it without complication.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.150
(Sighing)

06:44.870 --> 06:47.862
- (Suzanna) He's
already dreaming.

06:49.840 --> 06:52.502
- I wish that we could
keep him here.

06:55.780 --> 06:57.248
He's happy.

06:57.350 --> 07:00.513
- At home, he is, yes.

07:00.620 --> 07:03.487
I worry with the
children in town,

07:03.590 --> 07:06.241
that he is--

07:06.350 --> 07:09.524
He wants to tell them that
his father's returned.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.928
- He_-

07:12.030 --> 07:15.625
He knows that
he cannot.

07:15.730 --> 07:18.392
- Of course. No.

07:18.500 --> 07:22.130
(Sighing)

07:22.240 --> 07:25.210
Caleb Miller saw your
lifeless body in the war.

07:27.180 --> 07:30.946
He told me himself
that you were dead.

07:31.050 --> 07:34.020
I think it makes Isaac
lonely to hide this,

07:36.350 --> 07:39.342
even though we are
happy as we are.

07:41.190 --> 07:44.182
And he understands
this is a miracle.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.699
- My immortality

07:49.800 --> 07:53.395
- would not be a
miracle in their eyes.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.468
They would think
me unnatural.

07:57.570 --> 08:01.529
(Sighing)

08:01.640 --> 08:03.005
- Aidan, wake up.

08:03.110 --> 08:05.044
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

08:05.150 --> 08:07.517
Yep, yep, yep.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.679
- Oh! OK.
OK, I'm sorry.

08:09.790 --> 08:10.416
We'll move.

08:11.250 --> 08:11.546
- But I don't care.
I don't care.

08:12.790 --> 08:14.087
I'm not even solid. I don't
care where you guys do stuff.

08:14.190 --> 08:17.182
It's just 'cause Kenny...

08:17.290 --> 08:19.179
(Kenny screaming)

08:19.290 --> 08:20.519
Yeah.

08:20.630 --> 08:23.725
(Grunting)

08:23.830 --> 08:24.820
(Whispering):
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

08:24.930 --> 08:26.091
- How long has
he been doing that?

08:26.200 --> 08:28.168
- Hurry up.
Just get down there.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.631
She's out.
Just get downstairs.

08:42.950 --> 08:45.146
(Kenny whimpering)

08:45.250 --> 08:48.379
- Kenny?

08:48.490 --> 08:50.925
- What am I?

08:51.030 --> 08:52.520
What did you do?

08:52.630 --> 08:53.597
(Growling)

08:58.130 --> 09:02.135
- We can control our future,
our destiny as a breed,

09:02.610 --> 09:03.839
as a family.

09:03.940 --> 09:05.362
- As a family?

09:05.470 --> 09:07.632
- We are connected.

09:07.740 --> 09:09.469
I am your maker,

09:09.580 --> 09:12.914
and so I will
nurture you.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.875
That's what we do.

09:14.980 --> 09:17.039
- Stop talking to us
like we're children.

09:17.150 --> 09:19.084
I've been a wolf before.

09:19.190 --> 09:22.319
- Not mine.
I'm a purebred.

09:22.420 --> 09:24.229
My blood is different.

09:24.330 --> 09:26.185
Before you felt
like it was a curse,

09:26.290 --> 09:28.497
but now you'll see
it's a gift.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.591
- Don't you dare tell him
that this is a gift!

09:30.700 --> 09:32.225
- You think
I should thank you?

09:32.330 --> 09:36.062
- You're headstrong
just like my Brynn was.

09:36.170 --> 09:38.867
But you understand the
greatness of what we are.

09:38.970 --> 09:41.769
- My God! No, we are
not your family!

09:41.880 --> 09:44.440
- You are not part
of our pack.

09:44.550 --> 09:48.145
- At last you embrace
the notion of a pack.

09:48.250 --> 09:50.218
- I would sooner die
than run with you.

09:55.860 --> 09:56.930
- Is that a challenge?

09:57.030 --> 09:57.724
- Josh.

09:57.830 --> 10:00.458
- Are you really
ready to die?

10:02.670 --> 10:04.160
- I killed
your daughter.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.226
(Gasps)

10:11.970 --> 10:13.472
(Gasping)

10:20.450 --> 10:22.578
- OK, slow--slow--

10:22.690 --> 10:26.479
Slow down.

10:26.590 --> 10:27.955
- Am I going to
stay this way?

10:28.060 --> 10:30.324
- No.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.488
I don't know.

10:32.730 --> 10:33.492
Look, I--I am just trying to
understand what happened here.

10:33.600 --> 10:34.999
- You knew?
- No! I--

10:35.100 --> 10:37.068
Not when I turned
you, I didn't.

10:40.700 --> 10:43.431
- You know, I thought...

10:43.540 --> 10:46.976
that it was supposed
to be different.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.332
You said that, right?

10:48.440 --> 10:51.899
You said I was supposed to feel
different, but this? Really?

10:52.010 --> 10:53.648
I feel like
I'm on fire.

10:53.750 --> 10:54.945
- You're transitioning.

10:55.050 --> 10:56.779
- You can't say that!
- It's a normal--

10:56.890 --> 10:58.847
- You don't know
what I am!

11:06.330 --> 11:08.094
- I'm gonna see you
through this.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.919
You understand me? I am going
to see you through this.

11:11.030 --> 11:12.498
I'm gonna make this
right for you.

11:12.600 --> 11:15.900
- How?

11:16.000 --> 11:17.764
- I know what it feels like

11:17.870 --> 11:20.578
to give everything
to change your fate

11:20.680 --> 11:22.637
only to end up
in a nightmare.

11:26.380 --> 11:27.870
I'm sorry.

11:33.820 --> 11:36.357
Just don't make
any false promises.

11:36.460 --> 11:37.882
Aidan.

11:37.990 --> 11:39.287
(Screaming in distance)

11:39.390 --> 11:41.859
- Who was that?
- Kat.

11:41.960 --> 11:42.995
(Gagging)

11:43.100 --> 11:44.761
- Oh no!

11:44.870 --> 11:45.962
No!

11:46.070 --> 11:47.663
No!
- Oh! Kat!

11:47.770 --> 11:50.205
- I was just on my way
to the bathroom.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.608
Is this--
Who is this?

11:52.710 --> 11:53.734
- Tell her that
you didn't know.

11:53.840 --> 11:54.978
Tell her I was
a shut-in.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.707
- She's been dead...

11:56.810 --> 11:58.039
- Anything,
really. Jump in.

11:58.150 --> 11:59.675
- She's been dead
up here!

11:59.780 --> 12:00.918
- Remain calm, please.
- Why?

12:01.020 --> 12:04.285
- Why do you have a rotting body
in your house, Aidan?

12:05.220 --> 12:07.109
- OK. I think this
looks bad right now,

12:07.220 --> 12:08.984
but let's just calm down
and we can--

12:09.090 --> 12:11.058
- I have to--
I need to call the cops...

12:11.160 --> 12:12.150
-Ican
explain this!

12:12.260 --> 12:15.389
- ...0I someone.

12:15.500 --> 12:16.865
What is this?

12:16.970 --> 12:17.994
- Sally was
very, very sick.

12:18.100 --> 12:19.420
- This is why you
always wanted me to go.

12:19.530 --> 12:23.103
- I'm sorry. I just didn't
want them to take me.

12:23.210 --> 12:26.305
(Scoffs)

12:26.410 --> 12:27.878
(Birds chirping)

12:30.980 --> 12:32.470
(Panting)

12:39.050 --> 12:42.554
- You let me treat you
like you were one of my own.

12:42.660 --> 12:43.821
- I am sorry.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.887
I'm sorry that I did
what I had to do.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.367
If this is what our blood does,
then we have to get to Aidan.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.962
- Oh God! Kenny!

12:53.070 --> 12:55.664
- He has one of his own?

12:55.770 --> 12:57.602
Aidan has a son?

12:57.710 --> 13:00.236
Well, then now he'll know
what it is to lose a son.

13:00.340 --> 13:03.310
You and your pathetic
claims to do the right thing,

13:05.950 --> 13:08.317
why don't you
try starting here?

13:08.420 --> 13:10.081
Your friends
are waking up.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.885
(Groaning)

13:11.990 --> 13:13.014
- No!
- No!

13:13.120 --> 13:14.258
- Don't leave!

13:14.360 --> 13:15.054
- Look at you.

13:15.160 --> 13:16.753
Let your precious
vampires

13:16.860 --> 13:19.488
give you the end you deserve.

13:19.590 --> 13:22.321
(Grunting)

13:22.430 --> 13:23.898
(Growling)

13:28.400 --> 13:32.234
- Josh!

13:32.340 --> 13:33.978
We can find
another way out.

13:34.080 --> 13:37.539
- And so can they, and find
more people, children.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.744
- What are we,
vigilante killers now?

13:39.850 --> 13:41.579
- We're part of this, Nora.

13:41.680 --> 13:42.670
- No, not of this.

13:42.780 --> 13:45.215
- Yes, we are.
Yes, we are.

13:45.320 --> 13:46.515
And so is Aidan.

13:46.620 --> 13:47.485
Don't you understand?

13:47.590 --> 13:48.955
Liam may have
left him alone

13:49.060 --> 13:51.927
out of some vague loyalty
to us, but that's gone now.

13:52.030 --> 13:53.998
(Shrieking)

13:54.100 --> 13:55.556
(Grunting)

14:04.710 --> 14:08.032
- What is that?

14:08.140 --> 14:10.040
What are you doing?

14:10.150 --> 14:12.107
- Burning them.

14:36.370 --> 14:39.237
- I can't live like
this anymore.

14:39.340 --> 14:41.274
- This is the rest of
what I have for you.

14:41.380 --> 14:45.339
I was hoping this would
last you a few days,

14:45.450 --> 14:46.372
but you seem, um,

14:46.480 --> 14:48.244
I mean, you seem--
- What?

14:48.350 --> 14:50.819
- Well, you seem hungrier
than a normal vampire.

14:52.690 --> 14:55.682
Normal's the wrong word.
You know what I mean.

15:10.340 --> 15:13.401
Just space these
two out, OK?

15:13.510 --> 15:16.480
You're my blood and
I don't do well when I've, um,

15:19.550 --> 15:20.915
when I drink too much.

15:21.020 --> 15:24.081
So, uh,
pace yourself,

15:24.190 --> 15:25.646
Trust me.

15:31.260 --> 15:33.251
We're gonna be OK.

15:40.600 --> 15:44.002
- Papa! Papal!

15:44.110 --> 15:45.862
- Calm yourself, son.

15:45.970 --> 15:48.234
- They know!

15:48.340 --> 15:48.806
- Who?

15:48.910 --> 15:50.344
Who? Quickly!

15:50.450 --> 15:51.975
- They know about you!

15:52.080 --> 15:55.471
They think you are a devil
that mother's cursed,

15:55.580 --> 15:57.844
a witch who raised
you from the dead.

15:57.950 --> 15:59.247
- Oh, my Isaac!

15:59.350 --> 16:01.318
I--I am so sorry.

16:05.690 --> 16:07.499
(Grunts)

16:07.600 --> 16:09.557
(Crows cawing)

16:16.240 --> 16:17.537
(Sighing)

16:17.640 --> 16:19.961
- If anyone can get him
through this, it's you.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.434
And I say this
as someone

16:21.540 --> 16:23.907
whose heart you ripped
out of her corpse.

16:24.010 --> 16:27.947
- Sally, do you remember
when Rebecca turned Bernie?

16:28.050 --> 16:28.869
- Yeah.

16:28.980 --> 16:30.584
- I was horrified.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.660
He was just a kid.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.717
But what I never
told anyone...

16:38.330 --> 16:40.321
was that I was relieved.

16:42.530 --> 16:45.522
Exactly what I wanted
her to do. I wanted--

16:47.400 --> 16:49.391
I wanted that family.

16:53.940 --> 16:56.932
- Do you think that's why
you're so attached to Kenny?

16:59.950 --> 17:02.942
- I think that--that when
I survived the virus,

17:04.720 --> 17:07.712
I gave myself
permission to live,

17:09.990 --> 17:12.321
so I relaxed.

17:12.430 --> 17:14.057
And then I drank more blood.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.527
And my tolerance ain't
what it used to be,

17:16.630 --> 17:18.189
and so I would
wake up disoriented,

17:18.300 --> 17:21.792
not home, not knowing...

17:21.900 --> 17:24.869
but really not
wanting to know...

17:28.339 --> 17:30.342
that I turned them.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.145
- You what?
You--you turned them?

17:32.250 --> 17:33.718
- Yeah.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.345
- How many are
we talking here?

17:35.450 --> 17:37.839
- One more that I know of.

17:37.950 --> 17:40.920
- Why did you do
this to me?

17:43.530 --> 17:46.352
- Oh!

17:46.460 --> 17:47.689
Aidan! What are
you doing?

17:47.800 --> 17:49.199
- Look, I didn't intend this.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.324
I would never intend this.

17:50.430 --> 17:51.693
You know that I haven't turned
anyone since Henry,

17:51.800 --> 17:52.892
and with good reason,

17:54.100 --> 17:55.966
but to come back into this
world the way that it was, I...

17:57.110 --> 17:58.737
Sally, I was alone.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.535
- I feel alone.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.608
I want a family.
You know that.

18:02.710 --> 18:04.075
I understand that.

18:04.180 --> 18:05.909
So why wouldn't
you just talk about it?

18:06.010 --> 18:08.616
- Talk about what?
"Hey, Josh, guess what?

18:08.720 --> 18:10.449
“I'm making more of the thing
that I claim to hate."

18:10.550 --> 18:12.541
I couldn't talk about it.
I wasn't thinking.

18:12.650 --> 18:13.788
Something
just kicked in.

18:13.890 --> 18:15.085
- Instinct?

18:15.190 --> 18:17.010
- More than bloodlust.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.588
I mean, why kill anyone...

18:19.690 --> 18:22.421
when you can turn them?

18:22.530 --> 18:27.092
So I woke up
not remembering

18:27.140 --> 18:27.493
and then just
trying to forget.

18:31.340 --> 18:32.330
- Like me with
Archie Kingston.

18:35.580 --> 18:38.208
I'm sorry. I was just
saying that I get it, yeah.

18:38.310 --> 18:39.175
Go on.

18:39.280 --> 18:41.977
- Sally, listen.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.479
I turned a man,

18:43.590 --> 18:44.819
a man with children,

18:44.920 --> 18:47.048
and then I killed him.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.457
- Aidan, don't.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.619
- No, it's important.
You listen to me.

18:50.730 --> 18:51.549
That's your friend.

18:51.660 --> 18:53.958
I want peace,
I want humanity,

18:54.060 --> 18:58.019
but what I am
iS @ monster.

18:58.900 --> 19:01.164
That's me.

19:01.270 --> 19:05.229
And now that
innocent kid...

19:05.740 --> 19:07.606
(Sighing)

19:07.710 --> 19:09.633
Forever. He's--

19:09.740 --> 19:12.778
Well, he's
a monster too.

19:12.880 --> 19:15.474
- You and I both
learned the hard way

19:15.580 --> 19:19.915
to be careful
what you wish for.

19:20.020 --> 19:24.981
So all we can do now is
just learn to live with it.

19:36.640 --> 19:38.404
If I had known
we'd be here now,

19:38.510 --> 19:40.330
I would've hugged
you so much more.

19:40.440 --> 19:45.048
(Chuckles)

19:45.150 --> 19:48.643
- Sally--

19:48.750 --> 19:50.639
- Aidan.

19:50.750 --> 19:57.156
Aidan, get up!
Aidan!

19:57.260 --> 19:58.386
Aidan?

19:58.490 --> 20:02.222
- So you lied about
Brynn to protect Nora.

20:02.330 --> 20:03.400
How noble.

20:03.500 --> 20:04.729
- Where are they?

20:04.830 --> 20:06.161
- Paying penance.

20:06.270 --> 20:08.568
They mentioned
you had a son.

20:08.670 --> 20:09.239
(Sniffling)

20:09.340 --> 20:10.501
Where is he?

20:10.610 --> 20:12.499
- Get out of my house.

20:12.610 --> 20:14.806
- No! No! Aidan!

20:14.910 --> 20:16.378
Aidan! Aidan!

20:16.480 --> 20:20.144
- I know this won't kill you,
but it's just so satisfying.

20:20.250 --> 20:21.513
(Screaming)

20:21.620 --> 20:22.678
- Oh my God!

20:22.780 --> 20:24.248
- I repeat.

20:24.350 --> 20:25.385
- Aaah! No!

20:25.490 --> 20:26.514
- Where is he?

20:26.620 --> 20:29.510
- (Kenny):
Aidan? Aidan!

20:29.620 --> 20:32.089
(Aidan groaning)

20:32.190 --> 20:33.453
- Aidan, get up.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.050
No!

20:35.160 --> 20:37.128
- (Kenny): Aidan!

20:42.640 --> 20:44.005
- Aidan, get up.

20:44.110 --> 20:47.068
- So this is your
little boy, huh?

20:48.440 --> 20:50.033
You must be so proud.

20:50.140 --> 20:52.245
- Aidan?
Aidan, please!

20:52.350 --> 20:53.511
- Aidan!

20:53.620 --> 20:54.917
- Aidan!

20:59.920 --> 21:01.615
Please, please.

21:01.720 --> 21:02.858
Aidan, please!
- No!

21:02.960 --> 21:04.587
- Aaah!

21:08.260 --> 21:09.750
(Tires screech)

21:14.640 --> 21:16.631
(Grunting)

21:16.740 --> 21:18.060
(Groaning)

21:18.170 --> 21:19.103
- (Josh):
Aidan, where are you?

21:19.210 --> 21:21.235
- Just how my son was
when I found him.

21:21.340 --> 21:22.808
- Aidan!

21:25.980 --> 21:27.971
(Grunting)

21:31.320 --> 21:33.049
(Grunting)

21:33.150 --> 21:35.118
- Aaah!

21:39.990 --> 21:43.995
- I should've done this
the first time I saw you.

21:51.370 --> 21:54.374
- Let him go!
Leave him alone!

21:56.710 --> 21:58.701
Let go of him!

22:07.690 --> 22:15.290
(Groaning)

22:15.400 --> 22:17.926
Josh!

22:18.030 --> 22:19.100
- Stop! Stop!

22:19.200 --> 22:21.168
(Josh grunting)

22:25.270 --> 22:27.910
Oh my God! Oh my God!

22:28.010 --> 22:29.637
(Aidan groaning,
Josh panting)

22:29.740 --> 22:31.708
Nora! Nora! Please!

22:35.980 --> 22:37.539
(Birds chirping)

22:37.650 --> 22:40.915
(Sighing)

22:41.020 --> 22:43.990
(Panting, groaning)

22:46.560 --> 22:48.050
(Sniffles)

22:59.510 --> 23:01.501
- You didn't get
to kill him.

23:08.950 --> 23:10.941
- What matters is
that he's dead.

23:16.490 --> 23:17.980
Just hold this there.

23:22.460 --> 23:26.465
(Sighs)

23:26.570 --> 23:28.766
Hey. You OK?

23:28.870 --> 23:30.668
- Oh yeah!

23:30.770 --> 23:33.034
I am great!
Just great.

23:33.140 --> 23:36.599
Yeah. I was gonna go out
and get us a keg.

23:36.710 --> 23:37.905
- Ah! Perfect.

23:38.010 --> 23:40.672
- No, no, no. Listen,
I gotta go find Kat.

23:40.780 --> 23:42.874
She said she was
gonna call the cops,

23:42.980 --> 23:44.948
and the body count
is mounting.

23:47.760 --> 23:51.754
- One of those bodies is
a purebred werewolf corpse...

23:52.490 --> 23:54.959
if we're splitting hairs,
uh, you know...

23:55.060 --> 23:56.357
- Hey, you know what?

23:56.460 --> 23:58.895
Screw the keg.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.263
Pick us up some crack.

24:00.370 --> 24:01.792
- Yeah.

24:01.900 --> 24:04.107
- Aidan.
Listen, man.

24:04.210 --> 24:08.169
What--what happened
with Kenny...

24:09.010 --> 24:12.947
(Sighing)

24:13.050 --> 24:16.020
- Yeah, he was going
to kill her.

24:20.860 --> 24:23.886
I'll take
care of him.

24:23.990 --> 24:26.755
- He's a-- He was
a great guy.

24:26.860 --> 24:28.828
- Yeah, but it's
different now.

24:31.530 --> 24:33.532
You don't have
to say anything.

24:46.380 --> 24:50.169
(Seagulls squawking)

24:50.280 --> 24:52.783
Hello, Blake.

24:52.890 --> 24:53.857
- Aidan.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.212
- Thank you
for coming.

24:55.320 --> 25:00.190
- I expected you might be
irked about the wolves we drank.

25:00.230 --> 25:02.324
- Irked?

25:02.430 --> 25:04.728
(Laughing)

25:04.830 --> 25:07.219
No, not irked.

25:07.330 --> 25:09.492
I'm disappointed.

25:09.600 --> 25:12.137
That's worse.

25:12.240 --> 25:14.629
So you're lucky that
I need your help.

25:14.740 --> 25:15.605
- My help?

25:15.710 --> 25:16.734
- Yeah, you heard me.

25:16.840 --> 25:19.810
A friend of mine,
she withessed an event.

25:21.420 --> 25:22.649
(Sighs)

25:22.750 --> 25:24.411
She saw some things that
she shouldn't have seen.

25:24.520 --> 25:27.114
And I'm not very good
at compelling,

25:27.220 --> 25:29.689
but I get the feeling that
manipulation's your forte.

25:29.790 --> 25:31.326
(Chuckling)

25:31.430 --> 25:33.990
- Is this your idea
of sweet-talking me?

25:34.100 --> 25:36.455
(Laughing)

25:36.560 --> 25:40.770
- You know what the great
thing is about vampires

25:40.870 --> 25:44.829
is you can just
make them disappear.

25:45.110 --> 25:47.636
And I could erase
your friends too.

25:47.740 --> 25:50.505
Or you could
recognize the fact

25:50.610 --> 25:56.379
that I'm giving you the
opportunity to do me a favour.

25:56.480 --> 25:58.016
Let's be clear.

25:58.120 --> 25:59.588
I would owe you.

26:12.230 --> 26:14.130
- We could go to Alaska.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.139
- What?

26:16.170 --> 26:18.468
- You were thinking about it
for our honeymoon.

26:18.570 --> 26:21.403
I shot it down.

26:21.510 --> 26:26.471
But now, I don't know.

26:30.380 --> 26:33.589
That was crazy back there.

26:33.690 --> 26:35.158
- T know.

26:40.130 --> 26:42.121
- I'm talking about
you specifically.

26:45.270 --> 26:48.490
And I think
you know, lately...

26:48.600 --> 26:52.537
something's different.

26:52.640 --> 26:56.429
You didn't get
to kill your maker.

26:56.540 --> 26:59.999
But did you
even want to?

27:00.110 --> 27:03.569
- Of course I did, after
everything he's done to us.

27:03.690 --> 27:05.988
- But did you want
to lift the curse?

27:11.190 --> 27:12.055
What's going on?

27:12.160 --> 27:14.049
- I don't know.

27:14.160 --> 27:17.596
You're right.
I feel different.

27:17.700 --> 27:22.763
When we went to see Donna,
in this space between,

27:22.800 --> 27:24.564
I had a vision.

27:24.670 --> 27:28.573
My wolf, like in
the meditation with Pete.

27:28.680 --> 27:32.639
Only this time,
he's still with me.

27:36.320 --> 27:38.311
- You're still you.

27:48.630 --> 27:51.429
- What's her name?

27:51.530 --> 27:52.167
Aidan.

27:52.270 --> 27:55.763
- Kat Neely.

27:55.870 --> 27:57.338
(Knocking)

28:01.410 --> 28:03.003
- Miss Neely?
- Yeah.

28:03.110 --> 28:05.272
- Det. Ann Grether,
District BS.

28:05.380 --> 28:08.020
I'd like to speak with you
about Aidan Waite.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.441
- Yeah, come in.

28:10.550 --> 28:11.517
- Thank you.

28:20.690 --> 28:22.192
(Groans)

28:26.400 --> 28:28.437
What the hell
are you doing here?

28:28.540 --> 28:30.030
- We just wanna talk to you.
- No!

28:30.140 --> 28:33.110
I already called the cops and
I didn't even know what to say.

28:34.740 --> 28:36.674
No! No! You need
to get out of herel

28:36.780 --> 28:39.750
- Kat! Please, I am asking you
to sit down and just talk.

28:44.090 --> 28:46.343
- No! Get off of me!

28:46.450 --> 28:49.215
No! Stop!

28:49.320 --> 28:50.515
- You went to the wedding

28:50.620 --> 28:52.588
and you had a little
too much fun,

28:52.690 --> 28:56.456
and that's why you're feeling
a little foggy today.

28:56.560 --> 29:01.532
Aidan's bringing you coffee and
everything is absolutely fine.

29:02.670 --> 29:03.569
You feel--

29:03.670 --> 29:07.561
- No. Enough.

29:07.670 --> 29:09.001
(Sighing)

29:09.110 --> 29:10.737
- You're calm.

29:10.850 --> 29:11.510
You're happy.

29:11.610 --> 29:12.600
(Sighing)

29:13.750 --> 29:15.309
It was really one of the
happiest nights of your life.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.444
- Hmm...

29:16.550 --> 29:18.188
- And now that
you think about it,

29:18.290 --> 29:20.748
you realize you really
didn't get enough sleep.

29:20.860 --> 29:21.816
Close your eyes.

29:26.360 --> 29:27.350
I should go.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.226
- Do you think that it--

29:33.330 --> 29:34.832
- It worked.

29:34.940 --> 29:37.159
Which is why
I should go,

29:37.270 --> 29:38.738
'cause I'm nobody.

29:43.510 --> 29:47.048
Do you remember
saying you owe me?

29:47.150 --> 29:49.619
- I think I owe just about
everyone at this point.

29:58.990 --> 29:59.889
(Alarm system beeps)

29:59.990 --> 30:00.650
(Door closes)

30:00.760 --> 30:03.491
(Yawning)

30:03.600 --> 30:04.965
Hey!

30:05.070 --> 30:08.438
- Hi.

30:08.540 --> 30:09.063
- Hi.

30:09.170 --> 30:10.569
- Hi!

30:10.670 --> 30:12.468
(Moans)

30:12.570 --> 30:14.277
- I'm so sorry.

30:14.380 --> 30:17.907
- Why--why you sorry?

30:18.010 --> 30:19.603
- For waking you up.

30:19.710 --> 30:21.576
- Oh, I need to wake up.

30:21.680 --> 30:23.569
I thought you were
getting coffee.

30:23.680 --> 30:24.818
(Chuckles)

30:24.920 --> 30:25.842
- Yeah, yeah.

30:25.950 --> 30:28.612
I was-- The line was
just too long.

30:28.720 --> 30:30.119
- Your face!

30:30.220 --> 30:33.622
Whoa!

30:33.730 --> 30:36.722
What did we get
into last night?

30:36.830 --> 30:38.468
(Chuckles)

30:38.570 --> 30:40.129
(Giggles)

30:40.230 --> 30:41.197
(Moaning)

30:48.810 --> 30:50.130
(Bird squawking)

30:54.380 --> 30:56.417
(Crow cawing)

30:56.520 --> 30:57.476
(Sighing)

31:10.260 --> 31:13.662
- This is it.

31:13.770 --> 31:16.535
Isn't it?

31:16.640 --> 31:17.937
- Let's go.

31:28.150 --> 31:30.141
- Aidan, what I did
to your friend...

31:33.320 --> 31:36.085
what happened,

31:36.190 --> 31:37.658
I wasn't myself.

31:44.030 --> 31:45.828
(Murmuring)

31:45.930 --> 31:48.570
(Suzanna gasping)

31:48.670 --> 31:49.637
- Yes.

31:55.180 --> 31:57.979
(Gasping)

31:58.080 --> 32:00.799
- You could end
the struggle now,

32:00.910 --> 32:02.378
prove you are clean.

32:09.660 --> 32:12.186
Save your soul.

32:12.290 --> 32:14.258
Renounce the monster
who is how your husband!

32:18.130 --> 32:19.791
- T will not!

32:27.140 --> 32:30.337
- Isaac, Isaac...

32:30.440 --> 32:31.908
Wait here.

32:52.470 --> 32:53.392
Oh!

32:53.500 --> 32:56.265
Suzanna!

32:56.370 --> 32:58.509
- You call the devil
in her house!

32:58.610 --> 33:00.066
(Whimpering)

33:02.780 --> 33:04.771
- Suzanna!
Oh! Oh! Oh!

33:11.290 --> 33:12.610
(Moans)

33:12.720 --> 33:14.711
- Devil!
- The beast!

33:14.820 --> 33:16.959
- You poisoned the soul
of a good woman

33:17.060 --> 33:19.552
and you will be next
to die, demon!

33:19.660 --> 33:22.493
(Groaning)

33:22.600 --> 33:24.227
- A curse on your house!

33:30.740 --> 33:33.732
(Groaning)

33:35.180 --> 33:38.673
- Ah! Isaac! Run!

33:38.780 --> 33:41.909
Run!

33:42.020 --> 33:43.647
Run, Isaac!

33:43.750 --> 33:45.718
(Screaming)

33:50.620 --> 33:52.884
(Women screaming)

33:52.990 --> 33:54.458
- You're looking at the devil!

33:57.660 --> 33:58.661
(Screaming)

34:05.370 --> 34:09.170
You can't hurt me.
You can't hurt me!

34:09.280 --> 34:11.248
Oh, please.

34:11.350 --> 34:14.342
Dear God! God!

34:14.449 --> 34:16.418
- This is for my wife.

34:18.750 --> 34:20.239
(Cracking and screaming)

34:26.960 --> 34:28.449
(Panting)

34:31.130 --> 34:32.620
(Roaring)

34:40.310 --> 34:44.246
- Aidan? Aidan!

34:44.350 --> 34:45.806
(Whimpering)

34:50.949 --> 34:52.884
- Run.

34:52.989 --> 34:54.081
- What?

34:54.190 --> 34:55.112
- Run!

34:55.219 --> 34:57.188
- What am I supposed to do?
- Run!

35:02.560 --> 35:04.050
(Panting)

35:07.500 --> 35:08.990
(Crickets chirping)

35:13.210 --> 35:14.405
- That's it.

35:14.510 --> 35:15.534
- Are you OK?

35:15.640 --> 35:16.607
- Yeah, I'm fine.

35:16.710 --> 35:18.371
- No, Sally.

35:18.480 --> 35:19.572
- Yeah.

35:19.680 --> 35:23.275
I feel like
this is where I should be.

35:23.380 --> 35:26.486
- You know, I know the
consequences were--

35:26.590 --> 35:28.558
(Chuckles)

35:28.660 --> 35:29.786
Well, they sucked!

35:29.890 --> 35:30.857
- (Sally): Yeah.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.155
- Right?

35:32.260 --> 35:35.127
But watching you live
was amazing.

35:35.230 --> 35:37.198
- You guys gave me
everything I ever wanted.

35:39.370 --> 35:40.860
(Inhaling deeply)

35:44.270 --> 35:47.934
- So, uh, should we...

35:48.040 --> 35:50.532
sing something or...

35:50.640 --> 35:53.769
- Yeah, I really don't
want you to, though.

35:53.880 --> 35:55.712
- Good, 'cause I
don't want to.

35:55.820 --> 35:58.881
- Good. You know, I'd actually
just like a minute

35:58.990 --> 36:01.652
to say goodbye.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.717
- She would like
a--a minute alone.

36:25.310 --> 36:27.301
- Hey, how did
it go with Kenny?

36:31.420 --> 36:33.411
- He never had a chance.

36:52.270 --> 36:55.376
(Birds chirping)

36:55.480 --> 36:56.936
(Crickets chirping)

37:00.080 --> 37:01.570
(Birds chirping)

37:14.700 --> 37:17.920
(Whooshing)

37:18.030 --> 37:19.327
Are you OK?

37:22.640 --> 37:24.961
All right, let me
rephrase that.

37:25.070 --> 37:29.280
So you're a ghost again and you
no longer want to eat people,

37:29.380 --> 37:31.803
which is, well, I can
tell you, a slippery slope.

37:31.910 --> 37:35.039
But other than that,

37:35.150 --> 37:38.518
do you wanna go to
a movie or something later?

37:38.620 --> 37:40.088
(Both chuckling)

37:40.190 --> 37:42.181
- I'm OK.

37:42.290 --> 37:45.851
I'm happy I'm here
instead of...

37:45.960 --> 37:48.292
you know,
in Donna's belly.

37:48.400 --> 37:51.768
- Ugh!

37:51.870 --> 37:53.827
I'm thinking about Josh.

37:56.870 --> 37:58.167
- I wonder what it was
like last night,

37:58.270 --> 37:59.567
turning after
all that time.

37:59.670 --> 38:01.707
- Yeah, at least
he had Nora with him.

38:01.810 --> 38:04.029
- Yeah.

38:04.140 --> 38:06.450
Maybe it's easier
being the same as Nora.

38:09.020 --> 38:12.012
At least there's that.

38:12.120 --> 38:13.542
- Yeah.

38:13.650 --> 38:16.290
Maybe sometimes, it's just
easier to be the same.

38:22.330 --> 38:23.889
- So how is
everything with Kat?

38:24.000 --> 38:24.694
- It's good.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.529
- Things are good?

38:26.630 --> 38:27.495
- Yeah. Yeah.

38:27.600 --> 38:29.659
Things are good.

38:29.770 --> 38:30.896
- Yeah? They're good?

38:31.000 --> 38:33.059
- Oh boy.
- They're real good?

38:33.170 --> 38:34.001
- OK, I was
afraid of that.

38:34.110 --> 38:35.134
I'm gonna go
for a walk.

38:35.240 --> 38:37.379
- Yeah, you walk that off.
You walk that off!

38:37.480 --> 38:40.370
- Yeah, that's it.

38:40.480 --> 38:41.447
(Sighing)

38:56.700 --> 38:58.464
- The one that got away.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.527
(Gasps)

39:00.630 --> 39:01.768
- How is this happening?

39:01.870 --> 39:05.204
- Your presence is
very strong in this house.

39:05.310 --> 39:07.733
I can feel it,
now that we're connected.

39:07.840 --> 39:09.808
You feel the
connection, don't you?

39:12.450 --> 39:14.077
- The fire.

39:14.180 --> 39:16.615
- I haven't met the likes
of you and your friends

39:16.720 --> 39:19.189
in a long, long time.

39:19.290 --> 39:21.554
I respect your
chutzpah, I really do.

39:21.660 --> 39:22.183
(Grunts)

39:22.290 --> 39:24.554
Honey, stop.

39:24.660 --> 39:25.354
(Gasps)

39:26.190 --> 39:29.421
So, obviously,
we can't stay here.

39:29.530 --> 39:31.157
- I'm not leaving.

39:31.260 --> 39:35.060
- You know how this works,
better than most.

39:35.170 --> 39:36.831
You don't belong
in this plane.

39:36.940 --> 39:38.465
- I'm not going
back to limbo.

39:38.570 --> 39:41.335
- No, you're not.

39:41.440 --> 39:44.410
- You know what happens when
a death spot is destroyed?

39:46.410 --> 39:48.174
- You say we're linked?
I'll take you with me.

39:48.280 --> 39:51.045
I'll leave you there.
I'll shred you.

39:51.150 --> 39:52.584
You don't know
what I can do.

39:52.690 --> 39:54.488
- Oh no, I do.

39:57.820 --> 39:59.822
Why do you think
I like you so much?

40:13.610 --> 40:17.171
(Exhales)

40:17.280 --> 40:18.748
(Grunting)

40:28.420 --> 40:29.910
(Screaming)

40:49.180 --> 40:52.707
** Sometimes I don't
sleep at night *

40:52.810 --> 40:56.440
- *1T hear the wind
in the moaning trees *

40:56.550 --> 41:00.009
* T wonder how
my child will fare *

41:00.120 --> 41:04.079
* With wars and bombs
and thieves *

41:05.130 --> 41:07.428
* Thunder has begun

41:07.530 --> 41:08.998
(Cars honking)

41:11.800 --> 41:15.464
* A storm is gonna come

41:18.400 --> 41:22.075
* A storm is gonna come

41:27.980 --> 41:31.473
* Black crows circling
up above *

41:31.590 --> 41:35.151
* Crying out
Do you hear that sound? *

41:35.260 --> 41:39.219
* T never thought
it'd come to this *

Oh my God!
