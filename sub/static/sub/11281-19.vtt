00:05.506 --> 00:08.342
CHRIS ROCK:
At 15, I was sick
of being a nerd.

00:08.376 --> 00:09.710
When you're a nerd, people

00:09.743 --> 00:13.147
you want to pay attention
to you ignore you,

00:13.181 --> 00:15.616
and the people you wish would
ignore you, pay attention.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.618
And I was done with it.

00:17.651 --> 00:20.221
From now on,
I was going to be cool.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.190
Cool guys got everything--

00:22.223 --> 00:27.095
girls, cars, girls,
money, girls.

00:27.128 --> 00:29.330
But what exactly is cool?

00:29.363 --> 00:31.699
I tried the surfer look.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.501
* See it in your walk

00:33.534 --> 00:36.137
* Tell 'em when you talk...

00:36.170 --> 00:39.773
I tried the superhero look.

00:39.807 --> 00:43.311
* You got the right stuff,
baby... *

00:43.344 --> 00:44.778
I tried the cowboy look,

00:44.812 --> 00:47.081
but I ended up with
the Village People look.

00:47.115 --> 00:48.749
No matter what I did,
I ended up

00:48.782 --> 00:50.518
looking as cool
as a fat guy

00:50.551 --> 00:52.453
in a sweat suit with
a herringbone chain.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.796
* Ah, make it funky now.

01:02.830 --> 01:06.800

01:25.486 --> 01:27.588
Since I knew nothing
about being cool,

01:27.621 --> 01:30.158
I decided to consult with
the coolest guy I knew

01:30.191 --> 01:32.693
to find out his secrets.

01:32.726 --> 01:34.662
Hey, little dude
from across the street.

01:34.695 --> 01:35.529
Let me hold a dollar.

01:35.563 --> 01:37.865
Hey, man, can I talk
to you for a minute?

01:37.898 --> 01:38.866
Yeah.

01:38.899 --> 01:40.434
Later on.

01:43.571 --> 01:45.306
What do you think
makes a guy cool?

01:45.339 --> 01:47.175
Cool?

01:47.208 --> 01:49.377
Man, nothing makes you cool.

01:49.410 --> 01:52.380
You either cool or you're not.

01:52.413 --> 01:54.315
But what if you're
not born cool,

01:54.348 --> 01:55.683
and you want to be?

01:55.716 --> 01:58.186
Well, the fastest way
is to associate yourself

01:58.219 --> 01:59.720
with cool people.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.689
That way you're cool
by association.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.457
But why would they want
to hang with me?

02:03.491 --> 02:06.860
Look, man, it starts
with attitude, all right?

02:06.894 --> 02:09.597
Followed by a little
head gear.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.664
Accompanied by the walk.

02:10.698 --> 02:11.665
The walk?

02:11.699 --> 02:14.568
Yes, man.
All right-- the walk.

02:16.937 --> 02:19.507
You got to put a lean
in your walk, man.

02:19.540 --> 02:20.741
You know, like
you're slightly bothered

02:20.774 --> 02:22.576
by an old gunshot
wound to the hip.

02:22.610 --> 02:23.777
Like this.

02:23.811 --> 02:24.912
Easy for him--

02:24.945 --> 02:27.615
he had a gunshot wound
to the hip.

02:28.916 --> 02:31.585
You see?
Now you try.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.658
Nah, man, that ain't it.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.527
Look, uh...

02:39.560 --> 02:41.629
The collar, that's right.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.731
Get this collar
popped up, man.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.600
All right, now try again.

02:46.634 --> 02:49.270
I can't watch this.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.904
Nah, nah, that's...

02:50.938 --> 02:52.740
that's not it at all.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.242
All right, look,
we definitely

02:54.275 --> 02:57.245
gonna have to pull out
the big guns on this.

02:57.278 --> 02:59.580
Now, the coolest boy
in the world right now

02:59.613 --> 03:01.582
is LL Cool J.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.284
And you think you can
make me look like him?

03:03.317 --> 03:06.220
Let's find out.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.892
Not bad. Not bad at all.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.627
Hey, Chris.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.263
It's working already?!

03:15.296 --> 03:16.697
Let me hold a dollar.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.733
Here's my self-respect, too.
Keep the change.

03:19.767 --> 03:23.771
Well, got to go, little dude
from across the street.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.673
Stay cool.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.742
While I was on my way
to being cool,

03:28.776 --> 03:31.779
spring cleaning was
making my mother hot.

03:33.381 --> 03:34.648
Ugh!

03:34.682 --> 03:37.318
Look at all this junk.

03:47.395 --> 03:49.797
No he didn't.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.899
Julius!

03:53.567 --> 03:54.635
What's going on?

03:54.668 --> 03:57.371
This is what's going on.

03:57.405 --> 03:59.907
You told me you were going
to get rid of that years ago.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.642
Instead you just
hid it from me?

04:01.675 --> 04:02.710
It wasn't hid.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.611
Yes, it was.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.813
It was underneath
your camouflage jacket.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.881
It was camouflaged!

04:07.915 --> 04:08.749
Baby, it's a good coat.

04:08.782 --> 04:12.019
Do you remember who
gave you this coat?

04:12.052 --> 04:14.855
I think it was Janet.

04:14.888 --> 04:15.956
You're damn right!

04:15.989 --> 04:18.359
So when you told me that you
were gonna get rid of it,

04:18.392 --> 04:20.861
that means you were lying,
so now you're a liar?

04:20.894 --> 04:23.364
Yes.
You're acting like you
pulled Janet out of the closet.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.965
What difference
does it make?

04:24.998 --> 04:28.536
It's a coat, not
a woman-- damn!

04:28.569 --> 04:30.804
So you're telling me
you're going to keep the coat,

04:30.838 --> 04:34.074
even though I'm telling you
I don't want you to keep it?

04:34.107 --> 04:36.744
Yeah. I see no sane
reason to get rid of
it, so I'm keeping it.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.979
Okay, fine.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.714
Keep the coat, Julius.

04:40.748 --> 04:43.050
I hope it keeps you warm.

04:43.083 --> 04:46.086
Takes a brave man to choose
a coat over a woman.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.788
A brave stupid man.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.061
Hey, man, did you
get shot in the leg?

04:54.094 --> 04:55.763
No, why?

04:55.796 --> 04:57.097
'Cause you're walking
like it hurts.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.600
I'm just trying
to be cool.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.369
It's not working.

05:01.402 --> 05:02.903
It's not working?

05:02.936 --> 05:05.072
Look at you-- you look like
a powder blue Dean Martin.

05:05.105 --> 05:07.375
Technically, I look like
a powder blue Joey Bishop.

05:07.408 --> 05:08.409
Whatever.

05:08.442 --> 05:09.510
We need to change
our images.

05:09.543 --> 05:10.878
I don't know about you,

05:10.911 --> 05:12.813
but I'm tired of being at
the bottom of the totem pole.

05:12.846 --> 05:13.881
A powder blue totem pole.

05:13.914 --> 05:14.915
That's true.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.717
I want to be
like them.

05:18.586 --> 05:22.723
Tell me why they
don't go to school
and they don't work,

05:22.756 --> 05:24.124
but they have great cars
and great girls?

05:24.157 --> 05:24.925
Because they're criminals.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.960
Those are the kids
from the arcade.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.697
We can't be like them.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.932
I mean, those kids
have either been suspended,

05:31.965 --> 05:33.934
expelled or dropped
out of school.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.836
When you're old,
that makes you a loser,

05:35.869 --> 05:38.806
but when you're young,
it gives the illusion of cool.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.108
Shh, be quiet.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.446
Hey, kid, you got a cigarette?

05:45.479 --> 05:47.948
No, but I got some gum.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.850
Forget it.

05:53.153 --> 05:54.822
It's spearmint.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.056
And sugar-free.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.025
I don't think he's listening.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.493
Well, we learned
one thing--

05:59.527 --> 06:01.595
cool guys have
cigarettes.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.864
Now before you go getting
all upset,

06:03.897 --> 06:06.967
in 1986,
almost everybody smoked.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.869
People didn't give a damn
about health.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.038
Here's a partial list
of things in this picture

06:11.071 --> 06:13.407
that people didn't know
where dangerous.

06:22.049 --> 06:25.118
Eventually, all these people
died horribly,

06:25.152 --> 06:27.655
but while they lived,
they were cool.

06:27.688 --> 06:30.758
My brother Drew was so cool,
he could do anything.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.527
But in the spring of '86,
that changed.

06:33.561 --> 06:36.497
Here, take this thing
away from me.
What's this?

06:36.530 --> 06:37.931
It's evil.

06:37.965 --> 06:38.932
The Rufus Cube--

06:38.966 --> 06:41.001
the most diabolical puzzle
ever invented.

06:41.034 --> 06:43.904
It caused nervous breakdowns,
divorces and suicides

06:43.937 --> 06:45.839
because it was almost
impossible to solve.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.708
This looks easy.

06:49.677 --> 06:52.546
Chris, I got to go into the
library for a few minutes.

06:52.580 --> 06:53.681
Watch the register.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.082
The library?

06:55.115 --> 06:57.017
Yeah, I got to go
to the bathroom.

06:57.050 --> 06:59.520
I do some of my best
handicapping in the john.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.154
Keep an eye
on the register.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.991
A big part of being cool
is taking advantage

07:04.024 --> 07:07.094
of opportunities
when they present themselves.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.199
Now that I had cigarettes,

07:12.232 --> 07:16.003
I had the start
of what I needed.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.038
A real cool guy
wouldn't have paid,

07:18.071 --> 07:19.807
but Nerdy McGee

07:19.840 --> 07:21.875
would have felt too guilty.

07:21.909 --> 07:24.111
Even though I had the keys
to being cool,

07:24.144 --> 07:25.879
Greg was locked
into being a square.

07:25.913 --> 07:28.115
All right, just put one
of these behind your ear.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.182
Dude, that's contraband.

07:29.216 --> 07:30.951
The Surgeon General
told us not to...

07:30.984 --> 07:33.554
Greg, do you want
to look cool or not?

07:33.587 --> 07:35.589
Yeah, but I don't want
to be a fugitive.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.192
Freeze!

07:39.226 --> 07:40.728
Go! Go! Go! Go!

07:40.761 --> 07:42.262
Get down!
All the way down!

07:42.295 --> 07:44.064
Slowly remove the cigarette

07:44.097 --> 07:45.566
away from your ear.

07:45.599 --> 07:48.769
Stay there, dirtbag!

07:48.802 --> 07:50.003
You don't have
to smoke it.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.839
You just have to put it
behind your ear

07:51.872 --> 07:54.107
and walk around like
those guys at the arcade.
The arcade?

07:54.141 --> 07:55.776
I'd like to get back
in there again.

07:55.809 --> 07:56.977
You went in the arcade?

07:57.010 --> 07:58.011
Yeah, once.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.554
Forget that.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.121
That was before
you looked cool.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.923
Okay, man, I'll try it.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.959
Yeah.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.727
Oh, remember, you get caught
with a cigarette in school

08:13.761 --> 08:14.728
is an automatic suspension.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.697
Right, it's just to walk around
and look cool

08:16.730 --> 08:17.831
for the other kids.
Right.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.667
So how do I look?

08:19.700 --> 08:21.902
Nervous. Come on, man,
pop your collar.

08:21.935 --> 08:24.805
Put your shades on.
Roll up your pant leg.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.273
Okay.

08:30.277 --> 08:31.545
Better.

08:31.579 --> 08:32.646
No it's not.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.881
All right, let's make a pact.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.916
If either one of us gets caught
by the teacher

08:35.949 --> 08:37.150
we don't rat out the other.
Deal?

08:37.184 --> 08:38.919
Deal.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.557
Chris gave it to me.

08:43.591 --> 08:45.292
Chris?

08:45.325 --> 08:47.828
I'm so disappointed
in you.

08:47.861 --> 08:48.962
I know that nicotine,

08:48.996 --> 08:51.865
pork rinds
and malt liquor

08:51.899 --> 08:53.667
are the black man's vices...

08:53.701 --> 08:55.135
You forgot white women.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.571
...but why infect Gregory?

08:57.605 --> 08:59.673
Because I wanted
to be cool.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.942
Now I just feel like a fool.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.310
I don't know.

09:03.343 --> 09:05.178
Well, I'm sorry, Chris,

09:05.212 --> 09:06.947
but you're suspended.

09:06.980 --> 09:10.050
When my parents found out, I
was finally going to be cool.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.585
Cool as a corpse.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.157
My father had worked
hard all day.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.259
But my mother had been
to space.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.161
You went to work
like that?

09:21.194 --> 09:22.896
Don't you know you
could get fired?

09:22.930 --> 09:23.997
What did your boss say?

09:27.034 --> 09:29.870
So you say you
want a raise?

09:31.905 --> 09:33.273
I got a raise.

09:33.306 --> 09:36.343
You shouldn't
be wearing that.

09:36.376 --> 09:37.745
Get rid of it.

09:37.778 --> 09:40.347
Oh, I'll be happy
to get rid of it...

09:40.380 --> 09:42.182
as long as you get rid
of that jacket.

09:42.215 --> 09:43.884
I'm not getting rid
of my jacket.

09:43.917 --> 09:44.918
Fine.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.053
Fine.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.888
Fine!

09:47.921 --> 09:48.956
Not fine.

09:51.725 --> 09:54.695
When you get suspended from
school, they call your parents.

09:54.728 --> 09:57.931
So if the phone rang,
this could be my last meal.

09:57.965 --> 10:00.400
So what's going on, Chris?

10:00.433 --> 10:01.902
What you mean?

10:01.935 --> 10:02.936
There's something
different about you.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.371
Did you get
a haircut?

10:04.404 --> 10:06.774
No.
Well, you look kind of cool.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.776
What he thought was cool
was actually terror.

10:08.809 --> 10:11.111
Mama, why are you
dressed like that?

10:11.144 --> 10:13.080
Ask your father.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.414
Daddy, why is Mama
dressed like that?

10:14.447 --> 10:15.783
Maybe your mother doesn't know
the difference

10:15.816 --> 10:16.884
between a perfectly
good coat

10:16.917 --> 10:17.885
and a spacesuit.

10:17.918 --> 10:20.087
Better be glad she doesn't
have a ray gun.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.255
So, Chris, how was
your day at school?

10:22.289 --> 10:23.323
It was all right.

10:23.356 --> 10:24.792
Anything interesting happen?

10:24.825 --> 10:26.426
No.
DREW:
You sure?

10:26.459 --> 10:28.729
'Cause usually you talk
more about school.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.397
Can't get you
to stop talking about it.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.732
Nothing happened

10:31.765 --> 10:32.866
at school, okay?

10:32.900 --> 10:34.034
It was just like
any other day.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.002
Any other bad day.

10:35.035 --> 10:37.337
Why are you talking
to your brother like that?

10:37.370 --> 10:38.706
He's just asking
you a question.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.373
Yeah, Chris, calm down.

10:40.407 --> 10:43.276
Drew, will you put that
thing down and eat your dinner?

10:43.310 --> 10:45.713
Dad, I've almost got it.
I can't stop.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.180
Either you eat your dinner
or do the cube.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.181
What's it's going to be?

10:48.215 --> 10:49.382
I'll take the cube.

10:49.416 --> 10:52.953
I thought somehow I had dodged

10:52.986 --> 10:54.087
the suspension bullet,

10:54.121 --> 10:56.323
but actually it was just loaded
in a different gun.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.357
Hey, Chris, wait up.

10:57.390 --> 11:00.027
What's up?

11:00.060 --> 11:01.261
Nothing. Just thought I should
tell you about my day.

11:01.294 --> 11:04.998
What about it?
Oh, I just sat around
the house by myself,

11:05.032 --> 11:06.099
answering phones,
taking messages.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.901
Good for you.

11:07.935 --> 11:09.169
Yeah, I talked
to Grandma,

11:09.202 --> 11:11.071
Uncle Michael, the principal
from your school,

11:11.104 --> 11:12.973
Daddy...

11:13.006 --> 11:14.441
Never underestimate
the power of the Devil.

11:14.474 --> 11:17.110
Wait a minute, did you say
the principal from my school?

11:17.144 --> 11:18.378
Yeah, you know, they always call

11:18.411 --> 11:20.848
when they suspend somebody from
school for having cigarettes.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.950
Did they think you were Ma?

11:22.983 --> 11:24.217
I don't know.
I just answered the phone

11:24.251 --> 11:25.953
and they started talking.

11:25.986 --> 11:28.055
You out three days... I guess
that's a total of $15.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.990
What is?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.091
Five dollars a day.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.060
You know it's going to cost
to keep my mouth shut.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.996
The price of being
cool was steep,

11:36.029 --> 11:38.031
but it beat the price
of being beat.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.337
Getting suspended from school
was hard,

11:44.371 --> 11:46.006
but figuring out what I was
going to do

11:46.039 --> 11:47.107
with my day was harder.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.143
Hey, man, what are
you doing here?

11:50.177 --> 11:52.045
I had nowhere else to go.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.881
You're not still mad
at me, are you?

11:53.914 --> 11:55.148
Yeah, actually, I am.

11:55.182 --> 11:56.149
You ratted me out.

11:56.183 --> 11:57.517
I'm torn about it, man.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.920
Please, don't make me feel
any worse than I already am.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.922
Why did you cave so fast?

12:01.955 --> 12:04.024
My therapist says
I'm bad under pressure.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.358
I'm just not cool.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.060
No kidding.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.528
Forget about it.
It's all right.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.064
So what are you going
to do all day?
I don't know...

12:11.098 --> 12:13.166
wander around till
it's time to go home.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.803
Maybe I'll see
you at lunch.

12:15.836 --> 12:18.105
Got to go.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.314
Well, all right.

12:27.347 --> 12:30.183
I was at the arcade, but I was
afraid if I went in

12:30.217 --> 12:33.020
what happened to Greg
would happen to me.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.525
Hey, it's Juicy Fruit.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.329
Hey, want a smoke?

12:42.362 --> 12:43.831
Look at Juicy Fruit.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.565
Thanks, man.

12:45.598 --> 12:46.834
What you up to?

12:46.867 --> 12:48.301
Nothing. Just hanging.

12:48.335 --> 12:49.136
What's the matter,
Juicy Fruit,

12:49.169 --> 12:51.104
you get lost
on the way to school?

12:51.138 --> 12:52.405
No, actually,
I got kicked out.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.841
So did I.

12:53.874 --> 12:54.975
So did I.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.043
Actually,
we all did.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.478
Except for Vinnie.
He never went.

12:58.511 --> 13:01.081
Hey, come on in,
hang out for awhile.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.382
Cool.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.885
I might not smoke,
but right now I'm on fire.

13:04.918 --> 13:06.820
You could do this
yourself, Julius.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.922
Yeah, but every time I do,
I nick my head.

13:08.956 --> 13:10.057
You know what's
going on?

13:10.090 --> 13:11.591
You got a lot of bumps
back here, man.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.526
Lot of lumps in the back
of your head, man.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.196
My grandmother used to read
these things, man.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.365
The configuration is telling me
you got a lot of tension.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.834
Yeah, well, that's true.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.870
Oh, got one coming
at 2:00.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.404
In barbershops
across America

13:24.437 --> 13:26.139
somebody's always on
the lookout for women.

13:26.173 --> 13:27.307
No matter how they look.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.142
Oh, man.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.543
Look at that outfit.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.512
Man, she looks a fool.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.381
I wished my mama
looked like that.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.548
I'd never
leave the house.

13:35.582 --> 13:36.984
Here she come across
that street.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.518
Come on, come on, get
a little closer, baby.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.621
Uh-uh-uh! That is a
Cadillac walk right there.

13:41.654 --> 13:42.956
Honky Cadillac.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.993
Wait a minute...
Man, that's...

13:47.094 --> 13:48.461
Who? Hey, hey,
who is it?

13:48.495 --> 13:51.198
No, don't worry
about it, man.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.332
Where'd she go?

13:52.365 --> 13:54.467
Hey, everybody.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.970
Hey.
Hey.

13:57.004 --> 13:58.105
Hey, baby, I was
just wondering

13:58.138 --> 13:59.306
what you wanted
for dinner tonight?

13:59.339 --> 14:01.008
Rochelle...

14:01.041 --> 14:04.644
I guess I'm
interrupting something.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.114
You know what?
I'll just make
you roast beef.

14:09.282 --> 14:10.217
Bye, boys.

14:16.256 --> 14:17.324
Man, you got problems.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.060
You got that right.

14:20.093 --> 14:23.096
The next day, I had no question
about where I was going.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.164
Hey, Juicy Fruit,

14:24.197 --> 14:25.365
you want some beer?

14:25.398 --> 14:27.300
Nah, I only drink beer
with my dinner.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.169
Maybe we should go get
something to eat later.

14:29.202 --> 14:32.005
Maybe. So what we doing
for the rest of the day?

14:32.039 --> 14:34.441
Just about time to go
pick up Vito.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.176
You're gonna
love Vito.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.477
Who's Vito?

14:37.510 --> 14:38.946
He's a friend of ours.

14:38.979 --> 14:39.980
He gets out today.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.148
Out of what?

14:42.182 --> 14:44.317
Come on, let's go.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.185
You're cute,
Juicy Fruit.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.653
You're not too bad-looking
yourself.

14:58.131 --> 15:00.300
Trixie had her eye on me,

15:00.333 --> 15:02.369
but somebody else
had their eye on us.

15:07.207 --> 15:10.077
GUARD:
This way, Vito.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.578
All right, Vito--
see you again.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.413
Later that day, I met Vito.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.382
He was the guy these guys
looked up to.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.417
He was also a convict.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.389
Who's this?

15:22.422 --> 15:24.091
He's Juicy Fruit.

15:24.124 --> 15:24.924
Juicy Fruit?

15:24.958 --> 15:26.559
What kind of name
is Juicy Fruit?

15:26.593 --> 15:27.961
My real name is Chris.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.396
Don't worry about it.
He's cool.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.663
Yeah?

15:30.697 --> 15:32.099
You cool, Juicy Fruit?

15:32.132 --> 15:33.266
Yeah, I'm cool.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.968
Not with that nickname.

15:35.002 --> 15:36.536
We'll see about that
the day after tomorrow.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.238
What happens the day
after tomorrow?

15:38.271 --> 15:40.407
We're going to get the guys
who ratted on me.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.376
We'd do it tomorrow, but I need
one day to get the guns.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.512
And you're going to be
the lookout.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.480
So you cool with
that, Juicy Fruit?

15:47.514 --> 15:49.282
Mama!

15:53.353 --> 15:55.022
ROCK:
Before I went ahead with
being a lookout,

15:55.055 --> 15:56.389
I got a second opinion
from Doc.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.558
And they want you to be
the lookout?

15:58.591 --> 16:00.293
Yeah, I mean, I don't want
to do it,

16:00.327 --> 16:03.196
but these kids like me and I've
come so far on my coolness.

16:03.230 --> 16:05.032
And I'm just
the lookout.

16:05.065 --> 16:07.367
I can't get in any real trouble.
Wrong.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.036
You don't know nothing
about crime, do you?

16:09.069 --> 16:10.303
You act as
a lookout,

16:10.337 --> 16:12.472
while something
felonious occurs,

16:12.505 --> 16:15.042
that makes you
an accessory.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.743
Yeah, but I'll still
be cool, right?

16:16.776 --> 16:18.345
Wrong again.

16:18.378 --> 16:21.348
There are a lot of subheadings
to being an accessory.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.516
You can be an accessory
before the fact.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.785
You can be an accessory
after the fact.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.621
Or you can be an accessory
during the fact.

16:28.655 --> 16:29.722
In any event,

16:29.756 --> 16:32.592
if you get caught,
you going to jail.

16:32.625 --> 16:35.328
Doc spent three to five
as an accessory.

16:35.362 --> 16:39.166
Do you know how embarrassed
I was when you walked in
there in that outfit?

16:39.199 --> 16:40.433
I don't see why.

16:40.467 --> 16:44.271
That was a perfectly good pair
of hot-pink fishnet stockings.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.339
I don't see any sane reason
not to wear them.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.441
Okay, you win.

16:48.475 --> 16:50.443
I'll get rid of the coat.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.412
You sure?

16:52.445 --> 16:54.181
Now I don't want
to twist your arm.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.049
That's a good coat.

16:56.083 --> 16:59.486
Baby, you look like you're
about to ease on down the road.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.621
Yeah, I'm sure.

17:01.654 --> 17:04.191
When all else fails, quit.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.526
Where's Drew?
Dinner's almost ready.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.495
He's upstairs working
on that cube.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.363
He's been messing
with it all day.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.465
He is obsessed
with that thing.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.267
What'd you do at
school today, Chris?

17:14.301 --> 17:17.504
Oh, you know,
same old, same old.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.440
TANYA:
My day was great.

17:20.473 --> 17:21.574
We're learning
time tables.

17:21.608 --> 17:22.809
Today we did fives.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.644
Five times one is five,

17:24.677 --> 17:26.246
and five times
two is ten,

17:26.279 --> 17:29.249
and five times
three is 15.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.084
And five times four is a brick
upside your head.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.689
Sure, I could have
not shown up,

17:36.723 --> 17:39.159
but then every time the
cool guys saw me at school,

17:39.192 --> 17:41.594
they'd say, "Hey, there goes
the guy that's not cool."

17:41.628 --> 17:43.163
All right,

17:43.196 --> 17:44.464
you stand here.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.166
If the cops come,
you blow this whistle.

17:46.199 --> 17:47.534
Got it?

17:47.567 --> 17:49.469
Yeah, but I don't really
think we should be here.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.404
I was out where
the buses don't run.

17:51.438 --> 17:54.374
I had lost touch
with the mothership.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.875
I was someplace
where I didn't belong.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.444
Chris, what are
you doing here?

17:57.477 --> 17:58.411
Sweatin'.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.280
I'm hanging with the
guys from the arcade.

18:00.313 --> 18:01.148
The cool kids?

18:01.181 --> 18:02.649
I don't know if
they're cool anymore.

18:02.682 --> 18:03.816
What's going on?

18:03.850 --> 18:05.185
I'm a lookout.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.586
And if the cops come,

18:06.619 --> 18:08.388
I'm supposed to blow
this whistle.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.522
Dude, that makes you
an accessory

18:09.556 --> 18:10.890
before, during
and after the fact.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.859
I know.
I don't even want to be here.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.294
But I'm kind of stuck.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.762
You got to think
about this, Chris.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.330
My uncle was a lookout
one time,

18:17.364 --> 18:19.132
and he ended up getting
shot in the throat.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.367
In the throat?

18:20.400 --> 18:21.901
Yeah, he didn't die,

18:21.934 --> 18:23.503
but he ended up
wearing a turtleneck

18:23.536 --> 18:24.537
for the rest of his life.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.241
I knew if I didn't blow
that whistle

18:28.275 --> 18:30.143
I would never be
one of the cool kids.

18:30.177 --> 18:32.145
In fact, the cool kids
might kill me.

18:32.179 --> 18:34.547
But if being cool
meant going to prison,

18:34.581 --> 18:36.349
that price was just too high.

18:36.383 --> 18:37.717
So what are you
going to do?

18:37.750 --> 18:40.287
I did what any nerd would do.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.423
That day, Drew lost

18:43.456 --> 18:45.225
his cool, too.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.394
What's wrong with you?

18:47.427 --> 18:48.628
Take this thing
away from me.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.297
It's evil.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.498
I know.
I hate these things.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.400
Yeah,
I never want to see it again.

18:53.433 --> 18:54.301
Me neither.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.705
So what kind of games
do you like to play?

18:58.738 --> 19:00.173
I love Monopoly.

19:00.207 --> 19:01.508
Really? Me, too.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.610
Maybe we can get together
and play sometime.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.478
Great.
Can I have your number?

19:05.512 --> 19:07.214
I already wrote it down.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.816
Even when Drew failed,
he succeeded.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.584
Guys who do the Rufus Cube

19:11.618 --> 19:13.953
end up with other guys
who do the Rufus Cube.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.922
Drew ended up with a girl.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.959
Who knew to solve
the Rufus Cube,

19:19.992 --> 19:23.363
you either had to have
the mind of a genius

19:23.396 --> 19:26.165
or the liver of Lindsey Lohan.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.437
Finally my suspension was up,

19:30.470 --> 19:32.539
and for once Tanya
didn't rat me out.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.474
Have a good day
at school, Chris.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.842
Thanks, Tanya.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.444
No problem.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.646
If you're wondering
why my cool friends

19:39.679 --> 19:41.248
didn't come after me
and kill me--

19:41.281 --> 19:42.382
it's because of what
happened to them.

19:42.415 --> 19:47.487
Johnny Boy spent the rest
of his life in prison.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.856
Trixie had
a tragic pole accident.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.524
I'm gonna move
your leg.

19:51.558 --> 19:52.792
Slow here...

19:52.825 --> 19:55.328
Vito lived a happy,
successful life

19:55.362 --> 19:56.829
for the next four hours.

19:56.863 --> 20:00.467
Then he was gunned down
by some other cool guys.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.802
It seems cool, like beauty,

20:02.835 --> 20:05.372
turned out to be
in the eye of the beholder.

20:05.405 --> 20:08.541
This task force will not sleep
or be deterred

20:08.575 --> 20:11.911
until the gang's leader
is apprehended.

20:11.944 --> 20:14.247
For the purpose of this case,

20:14.281 --> 20:20.387
we're calling him Mr. Cool,
aka... Juicy Fruit.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.621
* Everybody Hates Chris. *
