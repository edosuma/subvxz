00:00.438 --> 00:02.929
<i>Back in the '90s, there
was nothing we all dreaded more</i>

00:03.015 --> 00:04.623
<i>than parent-teacher conferences.</i>

00:04.695 --> 00:06.992
<i>My classroom was filled
with distractions,</i>

00:07.038 --> 00:09.105
<i>so I always kept my expectations low.</i>

00:09.172 --> 00:10.476
So, Tom's been doing really well,

00:10.547 --> 00:12.797
and I have seen so much growth
from him this past year.

00:12.890 --> 00:14.664
As far as a plan moving forward...

00:14.742 --> 00:16.911
Mr. Scott, you really want
to play the drums, don't you?

00:17.847 --> 00:18.946
Go ahead.

00:21.117 --> 00:23.684
<i>Each teacher had their own way
to deal with parents.</i>

00:23.753 --> 00:25.119
<i>Coach Mellor took a hard line.</i>

00:25.188 --> 00:27.421
Now I know why Eric
has no core strength.

00:27.490 --> 00:29.106
It's not him, it's weak genes.

00:29.153 --> 00:31.629
Hopefully, you guys will be
a little better at running laps.

00:32.590 --> 00:35.096
<i>Whereas Wilma took the path
of least resistance.</i>

00:35.164 --> 00:38.232
Karen is a joy to have in class
and making steady progress.

00:38.301 --> 00:40.167
Jessica is a joy to have in class

00:40.270 --> 00:41.636
and making steady progress.

00:41.738 --> 00:43.905
Logan is a joy to have in class

00:44.007 --> 00:45.273
and making steady progress.

00:45.375 --> 00:47.108
<i>But it did come at a cost...</i>

00:50.213 --> 00:51.812
<i>But no one took more pride</i>

00:51.881 --> 00:54.181
<i>in his parent-teacher
conferences than CB.</i>

00:54.284 --> 00:55.483
<i>He really went all out.</i>

00:55.551 --> 00:58.619
Hey, CB. Or should I say, "Aloha."

00:58.644 --> 00:59.654
You got the theme.

00:59.686 --> 01:00.728
Does anyone not?

01:00.823 --> 01:03.791
<i>Oui, oui! Bonjour!</i>

01:03.860 --> 01:05.459
Ah, John, please feel free

01:05.528 --> 01:07.094
to help yourself to some coconut shrimp.

01:08.331 --> 01:09.897
Mmm!

01:09.966 --> 01:12.199
It's like a regular shrimp
went on a tropical vacation

01:12.302 --> 01:13.334
in my mouth.

01:13.436 --> 01:14.936
Plus this ukulele music.

01:15.038 --> 01:15.937
You're really capturing the spirit

01:16.039 --> 01:17.305
of the islands there, Johnny.

01:17.407 --> 01:18.306
Mahalo.

01:18.408 --> 01:19.674
Oh, and last but not least...

01:19.776 --> 01:22.643
the "surf's up" backdrop
with fun props for pictures.

01:22.712 --> 01:24.578
Photo backdrop? That's a little lame.

01:24.647 --> 01:26.147
Are adults really gonna go for that?

01:26.215 --> 01:28.249
Whoa! Hang 10, dudes!

01:28.351 --> 01:31.185
<i>♪ One of these days,
you're gonna get outta here ♪</i>

01:31.287 --> 01:34.221
<i>♪ Live your life and finally be free ♪</i>

01:34.324 --> 01:37.191
<i>♪ Go where you wanna go,
do what you wanna do ♪</i>

01:37.293 --> 01:40.795
<i>♪ Someday, you will say
"Those were the days" ♪</i>

01:40.897 --> 01:42.997
<i>It was March 25th, 1990-something</i>

01:43.099 --> 01:44.298
<i>and Glascott had just returned</i>

01:44.400 --> 01:46.233
<i>from the state's annual
principals' conference.</i>

01:46.336 --> 01:48.469
- Good morning.
- Oh, hey, John.

01:48.571 --> 01:50.037
How was the Pennsylvania State Education

01:50.139 --> 01:51.272
Leadership Conference weekend?

01:51.297 --> 01:52.350
Ah, the P-SELC.

01:52.375 --> 01:55.476
It was two wild nights, a wild day,
and one calm morning

01:55.578 --> 01:58.045
at the beautiful Holiday
Inn Express in Harrisburg.

01:58.147 --> 01:59.747
Well, I should go prepare
for my first class.

01:59.849 --> 02:01.315
You're right, it does get crazy.

02:01.417 --> 02:02.984
- Yeah, I didn't say anything about...
- After checking in,

02:03.086 --> 02:05.152
we all met at the hotel bar
for Chardonnay,

02:05.254 --> 02:07.054
made dinner
out of the free hors d'oeuvres,

02:07.156 --> 02:09.723
and then took a dive
into the indoor swimming pool.

02:09.826 --> 02:11.058
If you know what I mean.

02:11.160 --> 02:13.094
Usually, "if you know what I mean"

02:13.196 --> 02:14.462
is preceded by innuendo

02:14.564 --> 02:16.764
that could possibly
be taken as interesting.

02:16.866 --> 02:18.132
I know what you mean.

02:18.234 --> 02:20.501
- Any school-related stuff come up?
- Absolutely.

02:20.603 --> 02:21.736
There were several presentations

02:21.838 --> 02:24.205
on innovative educational techniques...

02:24.307 --> 02:26.273
self grading, circular classrooms,

02:26.376 --> 02:27.775
Microsoft Encarta.

02:27.877 --> 02:29.844
Oh, my favorite... edible gardens.

02:29.946 --> 02:31.812
- Somebody say "edible gardens"?
- Yes, a school garden

02:31.914 --> 02:33.714
where the kids can grow
their own healthy foods.

02:33.816 --> 02:35.416
- I've been waiting for this day.
- Mm-hmm.

02:35.518 --> 02:37.451
I shall set an example
by growing my own food.

02:37.553 --> 02:39.020
I'll be the hero
we've all been waiting for.

02:39.122 --> 02:41.155
And the kids can study
the chemicals in the soil

02:41.257 --> 02:42.289
and photosynthesis.

02:42.392 --> 02:44.258
Oh, and I have a great idea
for a scarecrow.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.726
He's a veteran big city cop

02:45.828 --> 02:47.395
who's grown "too old for this [bleep]"

02:47.497 --> 02:49.597
so he moves to the country
for a quieter life.

02:49.699 --> 02:52.533
All right, so, we all want the
garden for different reasons.

02:54.537 --> 02:55.503
Hey, Mr. Brown.

02:55.605 --> 02:56.971
Hey, Weasel.

02:57.073 --> 03:00.007
I was wondering, um,
when my dad comes in tonight,

03:00.109 --> 03:02.810
can you maybe skip the whole
"really bad grades" part

03:02.912 --> 03:04.879
and focus on the "gets to class
on time" part?

03:04.981 --> 03:07.181
- But you're always late.
- Yeah, could you skip that part, too?

03:07.283 --> 03:08.949
Weasel, telling your dad
about your progress

03:09.052 --> 03:11.318
is kind of the whole point of
the parent-teacher conference.

03:11.421 --> 03:13.254
But he's so psyched
about me going to college,

03:13.356 --> 03:15.589
and, let's be real,
he's gonna be super bummed

03:15.658 --> 03:17.391
when he realizes I'm not smart enough.

03:17.493 --> 03:18.903
Don't say that. You're smart.

03:18.928 --> 03:19.964
You really think so?

03:19.996 --> 03:22.096
College is in the cards
for you. All right?

03:22.165 --> 03:24.265
And I'm gonna help you through
the application process.

03:24.367 --> 03:25.399
I got your back, buddy.

03:25.468 --> 03:27.268
- Thanks, Mr. Brown.
- Happy to help.

03:27.370 --> 03:28.436
All right.

03:28.538 --> 03:29.737
I'm gonna peel off here

03:29.806 --> 03:31.405
because these pineapples
are poking me in the nips.

03:31.507 --> 03:32.740
That's cool.

03:32.809 --> 03:34.308
<i>Later that night,
parent-teacher conferences</i>

03:34.377 --> 03:35.443
<i>were in full swing,</i>

03:35.545 --> 03:37.011
<i>which meant CB was in his element.</i>

03:37.180 --> 03:38.512
Nice to meet you.

03:40.049 --> 03:41.515
Oh, aloha!

03:41.617 --> 03:42.850
Mr. Brown.

03:42.952 --> 03:45.586
We haven't met before.
I'm Weasel's dad, Greg.

03:45.688 --> 03:47.888
Nice to meet you. You can call me CB.

03:47.990 --> 03:50.491
Come on in, take a seat.

03:50.593 --> 03:53.828
So, I saw he got
that 68 on the last midterm.

03:53.896 --> 03:55.396
Yeah, he normally does better than that.

03:55.465 --> 03:56.730
Well, that could be on me.

03:56.799 --> 03:58.332
The night before the test,
I surprised him

03:58.434 --> 04:00.000
with two tickets to Penn & Teller,

04:00.103 --> 04:01.869
and, uh, we were out pretty late.

04:01.971 --> 04:05.072
Wait, Penn & Teller?
The masters of sarcastic magic?

04:05.174 --> 04:06.974
Oh, man, the Ticketmaster guy

04:07.076 --> 04:08.476
told me that those shows were sold out

04:08.578 --> 04:10.177
and no amount of my tears
would change it.

04:10.279 --> 04:12.179
Well, I'm the event coordinator
at the Spectrum,

04:12.281 --> 04:15.483
so I wind up getting all sorts
of tickets... Ice Capades,

04:15.551 --> 04:17.817
monster truck rallies, X Games...

04:17.887 --> 04:20.187
- The X Games happening right now?
- Yeah.

04:20.255 --> 04:22.656
Have you seen
BMX Street god Garrett Reynolds?

04:22.758 --> 04:24.725
If you've seen BMX Street god
Garrett Reynolds,

04:24.794 --> 04:25.893
I will literally kill you.

04:25.995 --> 04:29.063
Whoa. Beep, beep!
Super fan coming through.

04:29.132 --> 04:31.198
- Honk!
- Would you like me to get you some tickets?

04:31.300 --> 04:32.733
Kssh! "Uh, Earth to Greg.

04:32.835 --> 04:34.335
Uh, CB would love to get those tickets.

04:34.437 --> 04:35.603
It's his dream." Kssh!

04:35.671 --> 04:37.104
Kssh! "Greg here.

04:37.173 --> 04:38.973
Tickets are locked
and ready for takeoff."

04:39.075 --> 04:41.208
Kssh!

04:41.310 --> 04:42.877
We play so well together.

04:42.979 --> 04:44.512
Listen... about that 68.

04:44.614 --> 04:45.846
Gosh, I wish there was a way

04:45.948 --> 04:47.148
we could move him out of "D"

04:47.216 --> 04:49.016
into... into C-ville, you know?

04:49.118 --> 04:50.985
Weasel's a good kid,
and I suppose I can give him

04:51.087 --> 04:52.419
a little extra credit work,

04:52.488 --> 04:54.288
hopefully get him
on that train to C-ville.

04:54.357 --> 04:56.157
I knew you were a cool guy.

04:56.225 --> 04:58.092
I am. I'm a cool guy.

04:58.194 --> 05:00.060
<i>As CB met the friend of his dreams,</i>

05:00.163 --> 05:02.830
<i>Mellor and Wilma were on cloud
nine in their new garden.</i>

05:03.933 --> 05:06.867
What in the H-E-double canoe
paddles is going on here?!

05:06.936 --> 05:09.370
I think you mean what's
growing on here, Mr. Ball,

05:09.438 --> 05:11.639
because this is our new
edible, raised garden!

05:11.741 --> 05:13.007
It's an amazing, hands-on

05:13.109 --> 05:14.808
educational experience for the students.

05:14.877 --> 05:17.444
It's also smack dab in
the middle of my parking spot!

05:17.547 --> 05:19.647
You see that sign?
It's perfectly clear...

05:19.749 --> 05:22.249
"reserved for board members."

05:22.351 --> 05:24.351
Come on, Earl. Nobody parks
in these spots anymore.

05:24.453 --> 05:26.487
I know that 'cause a squirrel
died here three years ago

05:26.556 --> 05:28.189
and the skeleton
just blew away last week.

05:28.257 --> 05:29.757
Couldn't you just maybe park
in the visitor's lot?

05:29.859 --> 05:31.825
Visitor's lot?!

05:31.928 --> 05:33.093
Are you really suggesting

05:33.162 --> 05:36.564
that the former principal
of this school for two decades

05:36.666 --> 05:38.032
is a visitor?

05:38.100 --> 05:41.168
Oh, hi, Earl. Are you here to
get the "411" on the convention?

05:41.270 --> 05:42.703
Because things got crazy.

05:42.805 --> 05:44.705
They had a sign that said "No Diving."

05:44.807 --> 05:45.973
This guy dove.

05:46.042 --> 05:48.342
How could you let them put
a garden in my parking spot?

05:48.411 --> 05:51.912
Now, these two suggest
I just take a visitor's spot.

05:52.014 --> 05:53.581
Visitor's spot!

05:53.683 --> 05:55.249
Homie don't play that.

05:55.318 --> 05:57.651
Well, a garden is a wonderful
learning tool, Earl.

05:57.720 --> 06:00.955
That type of radical decision
requires authorization.

06:01.057 --> 06:03.524
Well, I thought it was such
a slam dunk, I just moved ahead.

06:03.626 --> 06:04.758
And Wilma and I agreed.

06:04.860 --> 06:06.794
Oh, you and Wilma agreed?

06:06.896 --> 06:09.363
Gosh, why didn't you
tell me that to begin with?

06:09.432 --> 06:11.098
Well, that changes nothing!

06:11.200 --> 06:12.700
Now, as your superior...

06:12.802 --> 06:14.668
and the reason why
you have this job at all...

06:14.770 --> 06:18.138
I expect you to take care
of this <i>tout de suite</i>.

06:18.207 --> 06:20.441
Of course. I'll, uh...
I'll have the garden removed.

06:20.509 --> 06:22.009
- Oh, hell no.
- Come on, John.

06:22.111 --> 06:24.111
He's right. I should've
followed the proper channels.

06:24.213 --> 06:27.615
I'll go move my car,
and you can take my space today.

06:27.717 --> 06:29.049
What the hell just happened?

06:29.118 --> 06:31.151
John's always like that
when it comes to Ball.

06:31.220 --> 06:32.386
He never pushes back.

06:32.488 --> 06:33.921
Well, you know who pushes back?

06:33.990 --> 06:35.489
- I'm guessing you?
- Me.

06:35.591 --> 06:36.657
I guessed right.

06:39.161 --> 06:40.427
Go left, Johnny. Go left.

06:40.529 --> 06:42.196
Yo, yo, yo!

06:42.298 --> 06:43.864
Guess who went
to the X Games last night?

06:43.966 --> 06:46.667
I hope it was you, otherwise your
outfit's ridiculous for no reason.

06:46.769 --> 06:47.735
It was me.

06:47.837 --> 06:49.003
Oh, and also, look at my swag bag.

06:49.105 --> 06:50.170
Cool. What'd we get?

06:50.273 --> 06:51.772
I got these gnarly shades.

06:51.874 --> 06:53.040
Pretty rad, I think, huh?

06:53.142 --> 06:55.042
Both gnarly and rad?

06:55.144 --> 06:58.045
Oh, man. I gotta process this.

06:58.147 --> 07:02.316
Oh, also, check out this extreme...
mouse pad. Huh?

07:02.418 --> 07:04.385
It's an extreme koozie. Yeah?

07:04.487 --> 07:05.786
Can I get a what-what?

07:05.888 --> 07:07.955
Sure, what-what makes
these things extreme?

07:08.057 --> 07:10.157
'Cause I got them at the X Games
and they were extremely free.

07:10.259 --> 07:11.825
How are you getting free stuff
at the X Games?

07:11.927 --> 07:14.161
Weasel's dad Greg took me.
He's got connections.

07:14.263 --> 07:16.196
Ohh, Weasel's dad.

07:16.265 --> 07:18.198
- I think the guy's a little shady.
- What? Why?

07:18.301 --> 07:19.633
First of all, my friend Carla said so.

07:19.735 --> 07:20.701
Greg's her step-dad.

07:20.803 --> 07:22.236
Duh. That's why she doesn't like him.

07:22.338 --> 07:23.837
Nobody likes step-dads.

07:23.939 --> 07:26.473
They've got secrets and mysterious pasts

07:26.575 --> 07:27.708
and second families.

07:27.810 --> 07:29.276
You watch a lot of
Lifetime movies, don't you?

07:29.378 --> 07:30.344
I do, yeah.

07:30.446 --> 07:31.545
But I've met Greg,

07:31.647 --> 07:33.647
and he's the slick,
connected, player type,

07:33.749 --> 07:36.083
so I'm just not really sure why...

07:36.185 --> 07:37.618
Why he'd wanna hang around with me?

07:37.720 --> 07:38.919
Is that what you're...
Is that what you're saying?

07:39.021 --> 07:40.921
No, it is not. I... Um...

07:41.023 --> 07:42.556
You know, you guys
are always trying to push me

07:42.658 --> 07:43.824
to do things outside of school,

07:43.926 --> 07:45.626
and then when I finally do it,
you want to stop me?

07:45.728 --> 07:47.594
I'm just trying to help you out
because I'm your friend.

07:47.697 --> 07:49.229
I don't need to be looked out for, okay?

07:49.332 --> 07:51.465
Because the only vibe
that I get from Greg

07:51.567 --> 07:52.966
is that he's gnarly and rad.

07:53.069 --> 07:55.002
Kind of like my extreme shades.

07:55.104 --> 07:56.403
But that's okay because I got

07:56.505 --> 07:58.972
this extreme eyeglass repair kit.

08:00.142 --> 08:03.277
I-I-I can fix the lid with one of these.

08:08.729 --> 08:11.338
<i>It had been a day since Glascott
had given in to Ball's demands.</i>

08:11.392 --> 08:13.104
<i>And it was really taking a toll on him.</i>

08:13.183 --> 08:14.893
- You okay?
- Visitor parking is full.

08:14.932 --> 08:16.768
I had to park over at Willow Grove Mall.

08:16.838 --> 08:17.855
That's like two miles away.

08:17.917 --> 08:19.250
Yeah, no Tae Bo for me tonight.

08:19.352 --> 08:20.718
You should've stood up to Ball, John.

08:20.787 --> 08:22.453
He was right. I need to follow
proper protocol.

08:22.555 --> 08:23.921
Protocol shmotocol!

08:24.023 --> 08:25.122
By taking the first word

08:25.225 --> 08:27.225
and rhyming it
with a nonsensical second word,

08:27.293 --> 08:29.627
I have conveyed
my dismissive opinion of it.

08:29.696 --> 08:31.429
We had to get rid of the garden
for right now,

08:31.497 --> 08:33.297
but maybe after we go through
the proper channels,

08:33.399 --> 08:34.398
we can get it back again.

08:34.500 --> 08:35.832
Now, if you'll excuse me,

08:35.902 --> 08:38.202
I need to go pre-arrange
transportation back to my car

08:38.304 --> 08:39.636
for after work.

08:41.307 --> 08:43.474
Nice try, but Ball has got
a strange hold on him.

08:43.543 --> 08:44.909
Well, then we'll have to do something.

08:44.978 --> 08:46.444
- Kill Ball?
- No!

08:46.512 --> 08:48.079
Look, if we go get all the other members

08:48.181 --> 08:49.347
to agree to the garden,

08:49.415 --> 08:50.648
Ball's outvoted.

08:50.717 --> 08:51.882
Right. We should do that first.

08:51.951 --> 08:53.884
- John will love that we did that.
- Mm-hmm.

08:53.987 --> 08:56.354
You went to the Board?!
Why would you do that?!

08:56.422 --> 08:58.689
- That's an odd way to display love.
- But it worked!

08:58.758 --> 09:00.825
The Board gave up their
parking spaces for the garden.

09:00.893 --> 09:03.394
And Ball can't fight the rest
of the board, so problem solved.

09:03.463 --> 09:04.726
- Yay.
- "Problem solved"?

09:04.788 --> 09:05.906
Why is this happening?

09:05.932 --> 09:09.734
Okay, long story short,
this is now my office.

09:09.852 --> 09:11.719
Well, actually, that's the entire story.

09:11.788 --> 09:13.854
It's neither long
nor has it been shortened.

09:13.956 --> 09:15.122
Why are you doing this, Earl?

09:15.224 --> 09:16.957
'Cause I directed you
to remove the garden,

09:17.026 --> 09:18.259
and then Mork and Mindy here,

09:18.328 --> 09:20.361
they went around behind
your back and over my head.

09:20.430 --> 09:22.229
You lost control of the faculty, John.

09:22.332 --> 09:24.365
So I'm stepping in,
I'm taking hold of the rudder

09:24.467 --> 09:25.666
until the ship is righted.

09:25.735 --> 09:27.622
This is not the outcome we foresaw.

09:27.647 --> 09:28.713
Shazbot.

09:28.738 --> 09:30.538
<i>Mellor and Wilma's plan had backfired,</i>

09:30.606 --> 09:33.240
<i>but CB was moving forward with
his agreement to help Weasel.</i>

09:33.309 --> 09:35.076
All right, Weasel, let's take
this college essay

09:35.178 --> 09:36.510
by the horns, all right?

09:36.579 --> 09:38.713
We just got to find something
that you can write five pages on.

09:38.815 --> 09:39.847
Five pages?

09:39.916 --> 09:41.882
Dude, that's, like, a gazillion words.

09:41.984 --> 09:44.085
- Actually, it's about 1,200.
- That's still a lot.

09:44.153 --> 09:46.387
It's okay. We're gonna take it
one step at a time here.

09:46.489 --> 09:49.290
So, we just got to find
a topic that you connect with.

09:49.392 --> 09:51.759
All right? So, let's see. Um...

09:51.861 --> 09:54.762
How about "Biggest Obstacle
You've Ever Encountered?"

09:54.831 --> 09:56.063
That's easy. This essay.

09:56.132 --> 09:57.231
We're not gonna do that.

09:57.300 --> 09:59.633
How about "Most Exciting Place
You've Ever Visited"?

09:59.702 --> 10:01.702
Geno's Cheesesteaks. No, wait.

10:01.804 --> 10:03.704
Pat's Cheesesteaks. No, wait.

10:03.773 --> 10:07.875
Geno's has the cheesesteaks,
but Pat's has the fries.

10:07.977 --> 10:09.343
- Gah!
- Moving on.

10:09.445 --> 10:12.913
How about "Who Do You
Admire Most And Why?"

10:13.015 --> 10:15.282
I feel like you could
connect to this one really well.

10:15.351 --> 10:17.385
'Cause if I'm writing it,
it's about your dad.

10:17.487 --> 10:19.820
- Yeah, maybe.
- Maybe?

10:19.889 --> 10:22.723
I mean, he is smart, he's funny,
he's got a great job,

10:22.825 --> 10:24.725
he knows famous people,
he's got great hair.

10:24.794 --> 10:25.926
He's pretty awesome.

10:26.028 --> 10:28.295
If we're talking awesome dudes
with great hair,

10:28.364 --> 10:30.364
that's my best bud Ronnie all the way.

10:30.466 --> 10:31.399
Uh, CB?

10:31.501 --> 10:32.767
It seems Weasel's father

10:32.869 --> 10:34.034
is calling my phone for you.

10:34.137 --> 10:35.336
Oh, yeah, I gave him your number

10:35.438 --> 10:37.037
so he could reach me at any time.

10:37.140 --> 10:38.939
Greg-ster, what's up, man?

10:39.041 --> 10:41.041
Hey, is it okay
if I give Ronnie your number?

10:41.144 --> 10:42.309
- No.
- That's okay.

10:42.412 --> 10:43.811
He's usually right next to me.

10:43.913 --> 10:44.779
You will not believe this.

10:44.881 --> 10:45.946
Greg just invited me

10:46.048 --> 10:48.282
to go see David Copperfield
with him tonight.

10:48.351 --> 10:50.651
Hey, my dad took me to that show
a couple nights ago.

10:50.753 --> 10:53.954
He cuts a woman in half and then...

10:54.056 --> 10:55.656
Well, I don't want to spoil it.

10:55.758 --> 10:56.757
He puts her back together?

10:56.826 --> 10:58.426
Oh, cool. You've seen it, too.

10:58.494 --> 11:00.728
Not only am I going to
go see David Copperfield,

11:00.830 --> 11:02.830
but I am meeting him before the show.

11:02.932 --> 11:04.498
And the Shiffmeister's gonna be there.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.267
"The West Wing's" Richard Schiff?

11:06.369 --> 11:08.102
- No, Claudia Schiffer.
- That makes more sense.

11:08.171 --> 11:10.404
Anyway, I got to skate on
out of here, so...

11:10.506 --> 11:12.473
So, we're done working
on my college essay?

11:12.542 --> 11:13.641
Weasel, one second on that.

11:13.709 --> 11:15.576
Um, CB, can we have a quick chat
in the hallway?

11:15.678 --> 11:16.710
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

11:17.980 --> 11:19.313
What are you doing?

11:19.415 --> 11:21.148
You're just gonna
leave Weasel high and dry?

11:21.250 --> 11:22.483
Shoot.

11:22.552 --> 11:24.819
Could you step in for me and
help him with his college essay?

11:24.887 --> 11:27.321
You teach reading and writing.
I am the music teacher.

11:27.390 --> 11:29.056
Well, the key word here
is "teacher," so...

11:29.125 --> 11:30.291
- You got this.
- No.

11:30.393 --> 11:32.726
I can't believe you're ditching
Weasel for Greg.

11:32.795 --> 11:34.328
Or are you just upset
because he actually

11:34.397 --> 11:36.063
- likes hanging out with me?
- No.

11:36.132 --> 11:37.798
I'm upset because
you're acting more like Greg

11:37.867 --> 11:39.366
- than you are yourself.
- How do you figure?

11:39.435 --> 11:41.535
Well, Greg took Weasel out when
he should have been studying,

11:41.637 --> 11:42.937
and now you're going out with Greg

11:43.005 --> 11:44.605
when you should be helping Weasel study.

11:44.674 --> 11:46.807
No, see, I'm still helping.

11:46.909 --> 11:48.042
Weasel's writing about the person

11:48.144 --> 11:49.944
that he admires most, which is Greg.

11:50.012 --> 11:52.246
So by hanging out with him,
I'll then gain information

11:52.315 --> 11:53.514
about how admirable he is,

11:53.616 --> 11:55.082
which I can then go and tell Weasel.

11:55.151 --> 11:56.317
Whatever you wanna tell yourself.

11:56.419 --> 11:57.651
Thank you!

11:57.720 --> 11:59.520
<i>CB wasn't changing his outlook.</i>

11:59.622 --> 12:00.955
<i>But as for the principal's office,</i>

12:01.023 --> 12:03.123
<i>it had undergone some minor
changes of its own.</i>

12:03.226 --> 12:04.425
Can I help you, young man?

12:04.527 --> 12:05.726
I need to see the principal.

12:05.828 --> 12:07.528
And you've come to the right place.

12:07.630 --> 12:09.363
How come you're out here
and not in your office?

12:09.465 --> 12:11.932
I felt I was too removed from
the students and the faculty,

12:12.001 --> 12:14.702
so I decided to climb down
from my ivory tower

12:14.804 --> 12:16.837
and, uh, become
a man of the people again.

12:16.906 --> 12:19.039
Also, Ball kicked him out of his office.

12:19.141 --> 12:20.541
- He's in there now.
- Yes.

12:20.610 --> 12:23.210
That and a little bit
of the ivory tower thing, too.

12:23.312 --> 12:24.345
But I'm still your principal.

12:24.413 --> 12:25.679
Is Martha the principal, too?

12:25.781 --> 12:27.014
- Yes!
- No, you're not.

12:27.116 --> 12:28.582
Oh, I was unsure.

12:28.651 --> 12:30.618
There's been a lot of changes recently.

12:30.720 --> 12:33.954
Martha, I need to dictate a memo.

12:34.056 --> 12:34.955
Go nuts.

12:35.057 --> 12:37.157
Yes, I authorize that, Martha.

12:37.260 --> 12:40.694
The following policy changes
go into effect immediately.

12:40.763 --> 12:42.863
First, this school will no longer have

12:42.932 --> 12:44.532
a student suggestion box.

12:44.634 --> 12:46.166
But that was my suggestion.

12:46.235 --> 12:48.769
And that box is a great way
for the students to feel

12:48.871 --> 12:51.238
as though they have a say
in their own education.

12:51.340 --> 12:53.173
Yeah, it's a gone-zo.

12:53.242 --> 12:55.242
Next, we will no longer be holding

12:55.311 --> 12:57.077
ice cream social Fridays.

12:57.146 --> 12:59.179
- Which day will it be on?
- Never day.

12:59.282 --> 13:01.282
That's not a real day, and you know it.

13:01.384 --> 13:03.250
And also that's my idea.

13:03.319 --> 13:04.985
Next, I was thinking of doing away

13:05.087 --> 13:08.188
with Glascott's "Good Guys
and Great Gals" picture wall.

13:08.257 --> 13:11.592
All right, I'm beginning to think
that this is personal, Earl.

13:11.694 --> 13:13.627
You're clearly trying to undo
everything that I've done

13:13.729 --> 13:15.396
since I've become principal,

13:15.498 --> 13:16.931
starting with the garden.

13:17.033 --> 13:18.165
Yes. That reminds me.

13:18.267 --> 13:20.968
Martha, did you get the forklift
to remove the garden

13:21.070 --> 13:22.403
and put it in John's driveway?

13:22.505 --> 13:23.804
Okay, Earl,
I understand that you're upset

13:23.906 --> 13:25.205
about your parking spaces,

13:25.308 --> 13:27.241
but this is too much.

13:31.647 --> 13:32.680
John, what's going on?

13:32.782 --> 13:34.481
Ball finally pushed me too far.

13:34.506 --> 13:35.593
And now you're pushing back.

13:35.618 --> 13:36.717
Yes, I am.

13:36.786 --> 13:39.320
- Ooh, I love it when this happens.
- Me too.

13:39.422 --> 13:41.789
<i>As Glascott was more
fired up than ever before,</i>

13:41.891 --> 13:44.425
<i>CB was pumped to hang out
with his cool new friend.</i>

13:44.527 --> 13:45.659
This is the best.

13:45.728 --> 13:47.394
I can't believe I'm meeting
David Copperfield tonight

13:47.496 --> 13:49.430
and David Copperfield's
supermodel girlfriend.

13:49.532 --> 13:50.664
What should I say, by the way?

13:50.733 --> 13:53.467
CB, relax. David and Claudia
are normal people.

13:53.536 --> 13:55.069
They put on
their skin-tight leather pants

13:55.171 --> 13:56.971
one leg at a time, just like you and me.

13:57.073 --> 13:58.606
- Phew! That's good to hear.
- You'll be fine.

13:58.708 --> 14:00.407
I mean, it's not like
you're some nerdy fanboy

14:00.476 --> 14:02.476
who's gonna do some lame
magic trick in front of him.

14:04.347 --> 14:05.479
Of course not!

14:05.548 --> 14:08.115
That would be so ridiculous,
wouldn't it?

14:08.217 --> 14:11.218
Greg, G, I just wanted to say
thank you for all this.

14:11.320 --> 14:15.122
Between tonight and the X Games,
I just... I really owe you one.

14:15.224 --> 14:16.724
That's what friends are for, right?

14:16.792 --> 14:18.626
- Absolutely.
- I mean, it's a two-way street.

14:18.694 --> 14:20.561
- You'll find a way to pay me back.
- Yeah, of course.

14:20.663 --> 14:22.296
I mean, I don't know
what I could possibly offer you

14:22.398 --> 14:23.897
that's gonna compete
with all this, but...

14:24.000 --> 14:26.400
Actually, I just thought of something.

14:26.502 --> 14:28.636
Maybe you could do me
another solid with Weasel.

14:28.738 --> 14:30.270
Oh, yeah, absolutely. You name it.

14:30.339 --> 14:31.338
I appreciate you helping him

14:31.440 --> 14:32.940
with his college essay and everything.

14:33.009 --> 14:35.209
It's just that he might need
more than a little nudge.

14:35.311 --> 14:37.344
So, you're asking me to... what?

14:37.413 --> 14:40.514
I mean, maybe you could...
write it for him.

14:40.616 --> 14:42.683
No, that... that's plagiarism.

14:42.785 --> 14:44.451
That's the biggest crime
an English teacher

14:44.553 --> 14:45.786
could possibly commit.

14:45.888 --> 14:47.655
Full disclosure, I took that sentence

14:47.757 --> 14:49.156
from my college English professor.

14:49.258 --> 14:50.357
Those are not my words.

14:50.459 --> 14:51.458
Okay, how about this?

14:51.560 --> 14:52.993
What if he held the pencil and wrote

14:53.095 --> 14:54.895
while you dictated the words?

14:54.997 --> 14:58.132
That way, he'd be writing it himself.

14:58.234 --> 14:59.566
Then we'd be square for everything.

14:59.669 --> 15:01.602
Greg, have you been
inviting me to hang out with you

15:01.704 --> 15:03.671
because you want me
to cheat for your son?

15:03.773 --> 15:07.107
Cheating, helping...
it's the way of the world.

15:08.444 --> 15:09.510
Well, I thought it was a different deal,

15:09.612 --> 15:11.211
where we were friends,
but I-I guess not.

15:11.313 --> 15:13.747
All right. I feel really stupid.

15:13.849 --> 15:16.250
Say hi to David for me, okay?

16:45.688 --> 16:48.179
<i>Glascott had finally taken
a stand against Ball,</i>

16:48.211 --> 16:50.039
<i>and he was going to do
the same for the garden.</i>

16:50.081 --> 16:51.218
I'm proud of you, John.

16:51.249 --> 16:53.008
It's good to see
the big dog still has bite.

16:53.118 --> 16:54.884
And I'm proud of you
for fighting for our garden.

16:54.953 --> 16:56.452
Although you could have chained yourself

16:56.554 --> 16:57.653
to something more sturdy.

16:57.756 --> 16:59.522
You think I shoulda went
with the bean trellis?

16:59.591 --> 17:00.690
Seems like a lateral move.

17:04.496 --> 17:05.994
What the hell?

17:06.064 --> 17:08.498
Hey, I got orders to forklift
that garden out of here.

17:08.566 --> 17:10.433
I've been good to you
all these years, Johnny.

17:10.502 --> 17:12.167
How can you take Earl Ball's side?

17:12.237 --> 17:14.837
I'm just a workin' man trying
to stay employed to pay my rent.

17:14.873 --> 17:17.874
If I'm a day late, my mom will
put my ass out on the streets.

17:17.976 --> 17:19.442
She's tough, but fair.

17:19.544 --> 17:20.843
Uh-oh. Ball's coming in hot.

17:20.912 --> 17:23.945
John! What's going on here?

17:24.048 --> 17:25.714
- Please stop this.
- I can't.

17:25.784 --> 17:26.883
I dropped the key in the dirt,

17:26.951 --> 17:28.618
and then I was trying to find the key,

17:28.720 --> 17:30.153
and I kicked more dirt around,

17:30.221 --> 17:31.754
so I can't find the key.

17:31.856 --> 17:32.755
This is insane.

17:32.824 --> 17:34.290
Now, get out of here

17:34.392 --> 17:36.292
so Johnny can haul this out of here.

17:37.562 --> 17:39.729
I'm principal here, Earl, not you.

17:39.798 --> 17:41.464
And who got you that job, John?

17:41.566 --> 17:42.632
- You did.
- That's right.

17:42.734 --> 17:43.733
But that was years ago,

17:43.802 --> 17:45.234
and you won't let me forget it.

17:45.303 --> 17:48.304
And all this time, I felt like
I owed you for this job.

17:48.406 --> 17:49.872
But you know what, Earl?

17:49.974 --> 17:51.073
I earned this job.

17:51.142 --> 17:52.675
- Bring it, John.
- Tell him, John!

17:52.744 --> 17:55.478
And the only people a principal
owes anything to

17:55.580 --> 17:58.514
are my staff and my students.

18:03.655 --> 18:05.354
They tell you that at the conference?

18:05.423 --> 18:06.622
No, Earl.

18:06.724 --> 18:09.592
You told me that
when you gave me this job.

18:14.966 --> 18:16.466
Johnny, we're done here.

18:22.774 --> 18:24.106
You did it, John.

18:24.175 --> 18:25.708
That's great. Thank you, everyone.

18:25.810 --> 18:29.212
Now, everyone grab a hoe
and help me find the key.

18:33.852 --> 18:35.318
So, how was the night with Greg?

18:35.420 --> 18:36.819
Hope it was worth it.

18:36.921 --> 18:39.388
Um... it wasn't, because you were right.

18:39.491 --> 18:40.823
Uh, Greg was using me.

18:40.892 --> 18:43.092
He asked me to write
Weasel's college essay for him.

18:43.161 --> 18:45.495
- I'm sorry.
- Eh, I guess I'm just a gullible idiot

18:45.563 --> 18:48.297
for thinking a guy like him
would wanna hang around with me.

18:48.366 --> 18:50.032
You are a way better guy than Greg.

18:50.101 --> 18:51.801
It's his loss he doesn't
get to hang around with you.

18:51.870 --> 18:52.969
Then how come last night, he partied

18:53.071 --> 18:55.037
with David Copperfield
and Claudia Schiffer

18:55.106 --> 18:56.138
and I just went straight home
and watched

18:56.241 --> 18:58.274
a "Boy Meets World" marathon on cable?

18:58.343 --> 19:00.076
Because he's a user and a d-bag

19:00.178 --> 19:01.410
and you're a sweet, trusting guy

19:01.513 --> 19:02.845
who always sees the best in people.

19:02.947 --> 19:04.714
Honestly, it's, like,
my favorite thing about you.

19:04.816 --> 19:06.582
Thank you. That's very sweet.

19:06.684 --> 19:08.184
I just can't believe I let Weasel down

19:08.253 --> 19:09.652
just to hang with a guy
I thought was cool

19:09.721 --> 19:10.953
at a cool event.

19:11.022 --> 19:13.789
First... not that cool
of an event. At all.

19:13.892 --> 19:14.824
Yeah, but I heard he made the crack

19:14.926 --> 19:16.092
in the Liberty Bell disappear.

19:16.194 --> 19:17.126
Yeah, when it's under the blanket,

19:17.228 --> 19:18.294
he spins it around to the other side.

19:18.396 --> 19:19.729
- Big whoop.
- No.

19:19.831 --> 19:21.497
N...

19:21.599 --> 19:23.432
Oh. Yeah.

19:23.535 --> 19:24.867
But the showmanship, though.

19:24.936 --> 19:26.936
And second,
you still have plenty of time

19:27.038 --> 19:28.137
to make things right with Weasel.

19:28.239 --> 19:29.405
Thanks, Lain.

19:29.507 --> 19:31.140
Now go work your magic.

19:31.209 --> 19:32.575
Okay.

19:35.313 --> 19:37.580
John, you were right.

19:37.649 --> 19:40.383
I was trying to undo
all of your hard work.

19:40.451 --> 19:41.784
Why would you do that, Earl?

19:41.853 --> 19:43.819
I think lately, I've been feeling

19:43.888 --> 19:46.455
more and more like
a ceremonial figurehead.

19:46.558 --> 19:49.825
Regal in stature,
but still ultimately symbolic.

19:49.894 --> 19:51.327
Not unlike the Queen of England.

19:51.396 --> 19:54.030
But people love the Queen.
And her namesake band.

19:54.132 --> 19:56.666
Well, it's just I miss
being a principal so much

19:56.768 --> 19:59.835
and... and making a difference
in the way you do every day

19:59.904 --> 20:01.337
since you've been principal.

20:01.439 --> 20:04.707
And... I guess that parking spot?

20:04.776 --> 20:07.944
Parking spot was my last real
connection to this school.

20:08.046 --> 20:10.980
And when you guys
put a garden on it, it just...

20:11.082 --> 20:13.249
Hey, Earl, without you,

20:13.318 --> 20:15.618
the school wouldn't be what it is today.

20:15.720 --> 20:16.852
You planted the seeds.

20:16.955 --> 20:19.555
I'm just here tending the garden.

20:19.657 --> 20:20.756
Thank you very much, John.

20:20.825 --> 20:21.757
Yeah.

20:21.859 --> 20:24.093
So, will you name the garden after me?

20:24.195 --> 20:25.428
Sure.

20:25.496 --> 20:26.629
And if you're not too busy,

20:26.731 --> 20:28.097
you wanna stick around
and get some coffee?

20:28.166 --> 20:29.498
I'd love to give you the 4-1-1

20:29.601 --> 20:31.867
on what went down
at the principals' conference.

20:31.970 --> 20:33.336
I would love that. Thank you.

20:33.438 --> 20:34.337
Well, first off, they still give you

20:34.405 --> 20:35.538
the extra mint under your pillow,

20:35.640 --> 20:37.340
but you got to call ahead
and ask for it,

20:37.408 --> 20:38.608
if you know what I mean.

20:38.710 --> 20:39.675
Oh, my.

20:39.777 --> 20:41.010
<i>Sometimes in life,</i>

20:41.112 --> 20:43.045
<i>you have to take a stand
for what you believe in,</i>

20:43.147 --> 20:46.148
<i>even if it means standing up
to one of your closest friends.</i>

20:50.054 --> 20:51.854
<i>'Cause even though
it can be intimidating,</i>

20:51.923 --> 20:54.991
<i>when you persevere, there's no
greater feeling in the world.</i>

20:57.829 --> 21:00.096
<i>Because you know in your heart
it's the right thing to do.</i>

21:02.233 --> 21:04.300
<i>So don't be scared.</i>

21:04.402 --> 21:06.002
<i>Because the truth is,</i>

21:06.104 --> 21:09.205
<i>new and exciting things
will grow out of the situation</i>

21:09.307 --> 21:11.607
<i>or maybe even blossom bigger than ever.</i>

21:16.414 --> 21:17.437
Weasel.

21:17.515 --> 21:19.181
How'd the essay go about your dad?

21:19.283 --> 21:21.083
I think you should just read it.

21:23.050 --> 21:24.394
Oh, my gosh.

21:26.714 --> 21:27.894
You wrote this about me?

21:27.986 --> 21:30.792
What can I say?
You're a huge inspiration to me.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.774
<i>In the end, you'll realize
that it was all worth it.</i>

21:39.514 --> 21:41.888
Okay, so we all agree
that Greg turned out to be...

21:41.944 --> 21:44.580
- A huge douche, yeah.
- Yes, <i>el douche grande</i>.

21:44.627 --> 21:47.971
That aside, he did have
some very cool <i>accoutrement</i>

21:48.018 --> 21:49.385
that I feel like I can pull off.

21:49.487 --> 21:51.033
Oh, like the bitchin' outfit
you're wearing right now?

21:51.127 --> 21:53.213
- Like this hat.
- Does that come with a paper route?

21:53.299 --> 21:55.322
- Gold hoop earring.
- He only gave you one?

21:55.401 --> 21:56.834
Bam. Fanny pack.

21:56.936 --> 21:59.070
German virgin who's on a trip
with his family.

21:59.172 --> 22:01.138
- What about this pager?
- Cool!

22:01.163 --> 22:02.283
Five years ago.

22:02.308 --> 22:04.375
Also, super-stylin' Mandarin collar.

22:04.477 --> 22:06.177
- I hate that on you.
- All right.

22:06.279 --> 22:07.411
Attention, all!

22:07.513 --> 22:09.647
The harvest from my section
of the garden has arrived.

22:09.749 --> 22:11.649
I give you nature's bounty!

22:11.751 --> 22:14.051
Oh, my gosh. I didn't know
we planted baby corn.

22:14.153 --> 22:15.953
No, that's just corn.

22:16.055 --> 22:18.522
I don't get it. I thought
I saw some great vegetables.

22:18.624 --> 22:20.958
Unfortunately,
the bus parks next to my box,

22:21.060 --> 22:22.760
blocking any direct sunlight.

22:22.862 --> 22:24.562
Oh! Cute little blueberries?

22:24.664 --> 22:26.697
I didn't know you were planting these.

22:26.743 --> 22:27.676
That's hard gum.

22:27.785 --> 22:32.785
