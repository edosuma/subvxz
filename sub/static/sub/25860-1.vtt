18:58.929 --> 19:00.346
Would you tell meif you were?

19:00.347 --> 19:02.891
No, I wouldn't.

19:02.933 --> 19:05.811
Okay so this is for you-it's the itinerary.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.313
Okay. It's more likean anvil.

19:08.355 --> 19:09.689
You know we couldprobably use

19:09.690 --> 19:12.317
this as a back-up anchor, you know?

19:12.359 --> 19:13.359
[laughs]

19:13.360 --> 19:14.527
Cute.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.405
So Evan told me you guysrun a really tight schedule

19:16.446 --> 19:18.448
and I have everything markeddown there down to the minute.

19:18.490 --> 19:22.286
Yeah, you know I saw allthe emails and we're going

19:22.327 --> 19:23.703
to have to make some changes.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.372
Okay, well you just told meyou weren't such a bad guy.

19:25.414 --> 19:26.874
I believed that statementwas legally binding.

19:26.915 --> 19:30.502
Well, you probably should havehad me sign something then.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.545
Evan already approvedall of this.

19:32.546 --> 19:36.842
Yes, I know and the thing isEvan is no longer here.

19:36.884 --> 19:39.761
Look, I can't have cooking inthe solarium going on

19:39.803 --> 19:42.890
while meditation is going on -how calming would that be?

19:42.931 --> 19:46.310
Oh, and we all know that yourjob is to keep the calm,

19:46.351 --> 19:49.730
but there wasn't any meditationon the schedule.

19:49.771 --> 19:51.940
Yeah, I just added it.

19:51.982 --> 19:54.568
Yeah, look I'm trying todistinguish myself from him.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.987
I want to give our guestssome cool new experiences.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.155
You should try meditation-

19:58.196 --> 19:59.698
I think it might be goodfor you.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.992
It's at the same timeas my event.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.368
Right. Yeah.

20:03.410 --> 20:05.203

20:05.245 --> 20:07.664

20:07.706 --> 20:09.833

20:18.800 --> 20:19.885
Oh.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.845
Hi, I'm Miles Websterfrom Excursions Magazine.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.680

20:29.895 --> 20:31.437

20:31.438 --> 20:33.231
I didn't know you were doingthis event!

20:33.273 --> 20:34.900
I took over a few weeks ago!

20:34.942 --> 20:36.109
Allie-Alexandra-

20:36.151 --> 20:37.778

20:37.819 --> 20:39.321

20:39.363 --> 20:41.573
Well, she is in great hands.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.492
Miles covered my Dad'sold hotel.

20:43.533 --> 20:45.077
He interviewed us a few times.

20:45.118 --> 20:47.829
Actually, we went on a datea few years ago.

20:47.871 --> 20:50.374
And then I had to go to Africaon assignment for two months

20:50.415 --> 20:53.877
and when I got backthis one met someone else.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.754
I never had good timingwith you.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.924
Yeah, actually my radarwas pretty off on that guy

20:58.966 --> 21:01.885
so I guess we both missedthe boat on that one.

21:01.927 --> 21:07.766
Okay, well if you have anyquestions about the ship

21:07.808 --> 21:10.185

Fit for royalty.

23:26.321 --> 23:28.740
What's that supposedto mean?

23:28.782 --> 23:30.659
I might have googled you.

23:30.700 --> 23:31.785
After I read the binder.

23:31.827 --> 23:34.453
You know, I like to knowwhat I'm dealing with.

23:34.454 --> 23:36.289
And what is it you thinkyou're dealing with?

23:36.331 --> 23:37.623
Well, you're a Grayham.

Good job.

24:01.148 --> 24:02.190
With no mistakes.

24:02.232 --> 24:04.401
You know you really shouldn't beso rigid.

24:04.442 --> 24:05.527
I'm not rigid.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.486
I - I'm a planner.

24:07.487 --> 24:09.656
That's literallymy job description.

24:09.698 --> 24:11.241
Some would call me structured.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.285
And some would call that rigid.

24:13.326 --> 24:15.328
I can help with that too.

24:15.370 --> 24:16.454
I don't need help.

24:16.496 --> 24:18.957
I need a new location.

24:18.999 --> 24:21.376
I've got the perfect one. Come on.

24:24.713 --> 24:29.342
I give you your new locationfor Living Easy in the Kitchen.

24:29.384 --> 24:30.594
We get to use this?

24:30.635 --> 24:32.387
Oh yeah.

24:32.429 --> 24:34.346
Evan told me that wecouldn't use the restaurants

24:34.347 --> 24:36.516
because it would interferewith the passenger meals.

24:36.558 --> 24:39.311
Yes but that was Evan's rule.

24:39.352 --> 24:41.021
I cleared it with the foodand beverage department

24:41.062 --> 24:44.941
and if you have a hard out by3:00 pm and that means gone,

24:44.983 --> 24:47.194
cleaned up, out of here?

24:47.235 --> 24:49.571
The restaurant is yours.

24:49.613 --> 24:51.114
This is perfect.

24:52.407 --> 24:53.783
We're going to have morethan enough options on board

24:53.825 --> 24:55.868
to accommodate everyone nightly.

24:55.869 --> 24:59.456
Ah, well Tony, I believeyou've met Miles.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.873
Yes, I have.

25:00.874 --> 25:01.958
Hello again, sir.

25:02.000 --> 25:02.876
Hello.

25:02.877 --> 25:04.169
Sorry, we're old friends.

25:04.211 --> 25:05.879
Small world.

25:05.921 --> 25:08.714
And in the most perfect way.

25:08.715 --> 25:10.008
Hard out by 3:00pm?

25:10.050 --> 25:12.844
Yes, absolutely, understood. This is great.

25:12.886 --> 25:13.887
Great.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.054
And speaking of perfectwhy don't we take you

25:15.055 --> 25:16.681

25:16.723 --> 25:18.642
You'll love itfor some shoots.

25:18.683 --> 25:20.559
See ya.

25:20.560 --> 25:24.356
Alright, please, 3:00pm, gone.

25:24.397 --> 25:26.608
Now who's being rigid?

25:31.404 --> 25:32.781
So he used to be a lawyer.

25:32.822 --> 25:35.575
What does he do to supporthimself now?

25:35.617 --> 25:38.828
I didn't ask Wes forhis bank statement Livvy.

25:38.870 --> 25:41.873
Yeah, because he doesn't haveto ask for yours.

25:41.915 --> 25:43.041
We're Grayhams.

25:43.083 --> 25:45.961
You always said thatwe have to be cautious.

25:46.002 --> 25:48.254
And it's true.

25:48.255 --> 25:51.424
But not every man is like Ben.

25:51.466 --> 25:56.846
I know I have battle scarsbut you barely know Wes

25:56.888 --> 25:58.682
and we can't possibly knowhis motives.

25:58.723 --> 26:02.143
I've been a Grayhamfor a long time Olivia.

26:02.185 --> 26:04.937
My eyes are always open.

26:04.938 --> 26:06.690
You have to trust my judgement.

26:06.731 --> 26:09.608
Mom I do trust you.

26:09.609 --> 26:13.989
I just... it's him thatl'm worried about.

26:14.030 --> 26:16.783
Just focus on your work.

26:16.825 --> 26:19.035
I will do whatever I canto help you and I promise,

26:19.077 --> 26:24.040
I promise to look outfor any red flags.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.126
Okay.

26:26.167 --> 26:28.794
I know I have to focus.

26:28.795 --> 26:30.963
But I just really wantto prove to Ben that I can-

26:30.964 --> 26:34.551
No, no, no, you don't haveanything to prove.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.803
Mom, I have everything to prove.

26:36.845 --> 26:40.890
Honey-do this for you.

26:40.932 --> 26:44.853
Leave Ben where he belongs, in the past.

26:44.894 --> 26:46.730

Okay.

32:28.404 --> 32:30.698
I went out on my own.

32:30.740 --> 32:32.533
I always felt like I had to worka little harder

32:40.833 --> 32:44.336
and I was wonderingwhat happened to you!

32:44.337 --> 32:47.506
I think it's very brave-taking a risk like that?

32:47.507 --> 32:50.342
See I've always been too fondof financial stability

32:50.343 --> 32:52.595
to do what I really wantedin life.

48:36.038 --> 48:38.707

My job is to allowother people to shine.

48:40.751 --> 48:43.253

52:03.703 --> 52:05.705
From your lips tocorporate's ears.

52:05.747 --> 52:07.999

53:30.206 --> 53:31.416
Well, your mother does.

53:31.458 --> 53:34.878
Yeah, now she does butthat was never the case.

53:34.920 --> 53:37.589
Oh!

53:41.760 --> 53:44.762
And I was raised to avoidunnecessary death!

53:44.763 --> 53:47.097
All death is unnecessary.

53:47.098 --> 53:52.771
This, however, is completelysafe and ridiculously fun.

So leave the old cautiousOlivia and Ben

54:04.157 --> 54:05.784

1:02:16.023 --> 1:02:17.316

1:02:17.358 --> 1:02:20.110

1:02:24.907 --> 1:02:25.783
Alright, thank you.

1:02:25.783 --> 1:02:26.659
Don't worry about a thing.

1:02:26.701 --> 1:02:27.785
It's my job to worry.

1:02:27.827 --> 1:02:29.619
Okay.

1:02:29.620 --> 1:02:30.496
I got a plan.

1:02:32.457 --> 1:02:33.124
No.

1:02:33.124 --> 1:02:34.041
Is it robots?

1:02:34.083 --> 1:02:35.042
No.

1:02:35.084 --> 1:02:36.377
Even better.

1:02:36.419 --> 1:02:37.795
It's robots isn't it?

1:02:37.837 --> 1:02:39.881
Alright we are tiedfor the championship.

1:02:39.922 --> 1:02:42.383
Table 27 you guys rang inwith Bette Davis

1:02:42.425 --> 1:02:43.926
which was the incorrect answer.

1:02:43.968 --> 1:02:47.221
Now Table 24 you guys cansteal this for the win!

1:02:47.263 --> 1:02:49.640

1:02:49.682 --> 1:02:50.975

1:02:51.017 --> 1:02:53.853
"It's going to be a bumpy ride."

1:02:53.895 --> 1:02:55.021
Olivia Grayham!

1:02:55.062 --> 1:02:56.481
You seem very confidentthat you know the answer.

1:02:56.522 --> 1:02:57.398

You guys are the champions! Congratulations!

1:03:04.947 --> 1:03:07.241

Especially your father.

1:03:24.133 --> 1:03:26.844
Maybe that's a traditionwe start again.

1:03:26.886 --> 1:03:29.346

1:03:29.347 --> 1:03:31.974

1:03:32.016 --> 1:03:33.976

Oh, I'll take a wine.

1:03:49.283 --> 1:03:51.118

1:03:57.375 --> 1:04:01.087

1:04:04.048 --> 1:04:06.592

1:04:06.634 --> 1:04:08.052

I sing.

1:06:09.548 --> 1:06:10.840
[laughs]

1:06:10.841 --> 1:06:15.680
Let me ask you a question, what is it you do not do?

1:06:15.721 --> 1:06:17.765
I can't eat peanut butter.

1:06:17.807 --> 1:06:20.226
It closes up my throatand I could die.

1:06:20.267 --> 1:06:23.229
Not the answerthat I was expecting.

1:06:23.270 --> 1:06:25.189
Yeah.

1:06:25.231 --> 1:06:27.942
You are a man of many talents.

1:06:27.983 --> 1:06:30.527
Well, I can say the sameabout you,

1:06:30.528 --> 1:06:33.989
except for the man part, obviously, that's weird.

1:06:34.031 --> 1:06:35.741
I can't eat parsley.

1:06:35.783 --> 1:06:37.535
I get hives.

1:06:37.576 --> 1:06:38.202
That's...

1:06:38.244 --> 1:06:39.120
Yeah. I break out.

1:06:39.161 --> 1:06:40.287
That's weird.

1:06:40.329 --> 1:06:41.789
It's bad.

1:06:44.083 --> 1:06:45.209
It was impressive.

1:06:45.251 --> 1:06:48.211
The way you ralliedwhen Preston didn't show?

1:06:48.212 --> 1:06:49.546
I'm putting that in my article!

1:06:49.547 --> 1:06:50.673
What?

1:06:50.715 --> 1:06:54.051
Yeah. A sort of "at sea anythingcan happen" angle.

1:06:54.093 --> 1:06:56.470
I feel good about this.

1:06:56.512 --> 1:06:59.140
I feel good about this!

1:06:59.181 --> 1:06:59.849
Ugh.

1:06:59.890 --> 1:07:01.308
It's these clubs.

1:07:01.350 --> 1:07:04.060
Probably.

1:07:04.061 --> 1:07:06.272
I did have a lot of help.

1:07:06.313 --> 1:07:08.482
Look, you were the star.

1:07:08.524 --> 1:07:09.483
Not him.

1:07:09.525 --> 1:07:11.193
You like her.

1:07:11.235 --> 1:07:12.820
[laughs]

1:07:12.862 --> 1:07:15.071
She's getting off, I'm staying on man.

1:07:15.072 --> 1:07:16.365
I've been there, done that.

1:07:16.407 --> 1:07:17.575
So what?

1:07:17.616 --> 1:07:19.034
It doesn't change the factthat you actually like her.

1:07:19.076 --> 1:07:21.120
Like a lot more thanyou're willing to admit.

1:07:21.162 --> 1:07:22.830
You're incredible!

1:07:22.872 --> 1:07:24.165
I don't know.

1:07:24.206 --> 1:07:26.500
I just kind of like being alittle more behind-the-scenes.

1:07:26.542 --> 1:07:30.045
The best thing that could happenwas Eve leaving without me.

1:07:30.087 --> 1:07:32.422
It showed mewhat I really want.

1:07:32.423 --> 1:07:33.757
This ship.

1:07:33.758 --> 1:07:38.387
I'm not going to let anyone oranything get in the way of that.

1:07:38.429 --> 1:07:39.597
Alright man.

1:07:39.638 --> 1:07:41.390
Whatever floats your boat?

1:07:41.432 --> 1:07:42.057
Ship.

1:07:42.099 --> 1:07:43.142
It's a ship.

1:07:43.184 --> 1:07:43.809
It's a ship.

1:07:43.851 --> 1:07:45.394
I'm going to go again.

1:07:45.436 --> 1:07:48.314
I know you like to bebehind the scenes

1:07:48.355 --> 1:07:52.359
but I'd love a photographof you for this article.

1:07:52.401 --> 1:07:53.110
Really?

1:07:53.152 --> 1:07:54.277
I want to showthose people

1:07:54.278 --> 1:07:56.989
at the Grayham Hotelwhat they're missing.

1:07:59.116 --> 1:08:03.329
I mean, look at this place. It's got everything.

1:08:03.370 --> 1:08:04.413
It's great.

1:08:04.455 --> 1:08:06.040
This ship is amazing.

1:08:06.081 --> 1:08:08.209
It's really amazing.

1:08:08.250 --> 1:08:10.836
I really have to get backto my Mom.

1:08:10.878 --> 1:08:12.171
Oh, okay.

1:08:12.213 --> 1:08:14.215
But you have a reallyamazing night.

1:08:14.256 --> 1:08:15.841
You too.

1:08:15.883 --> 1:08:18.177
Bye.

1:08:18.219 --> 1:08:19.970
[exhales]

1:08:29.355 --> 1:08:32.149
You know, I was actuallydreading this cruise.

1:08:32.191 --> 1:08:33.109
Really?

1:08:33.150 --> 1:08:34.150
Yeah.

1:08:34.151 --> 1:08:36.653
I mean, the magazinenever pays for a guest

1:08:36.654 --> 1:08:39.656
and lately I've been feelingkind of lonely.

1:08:39.657 --> 1:08:42.910
But running into youand your gang,

1:08:42.952 --> 1:08:44.829
it's been fun, I'm having a blast.

1:08:44.870 --> 1:08:46.664
They're a really good gang.

1:08:46.705 --> 1:08:51.418
Hey listen, maybe oncewe get back to dry land

1:08:51.460 --> 1:08:52.711
we could try dinner again?

1:08:52.753 --> 1:08:54.839
Just you and me.

1:08:54.880 --> 1:08:57.216
I mean what a coincidence right?

1:08:57.258 --> 1:09:00.094
That you come on this cruiseand you reconnect with somebody

1:09:00.136 --> 1:09:03.180
who always made you wonderwhat might have been.

1:09:03.222 --> 1:09:06.976
That's a coincidence that cannotbe ignored in my book.

1:09:09.228 --> 1:09:11.772
You don't have to answer meright now.

1:09:11.814 --> 1:09:14.692
Just think about it.

1:09:14.733 --> 1:09:16.735
See you tomorrow.

1:09:43.220 --> 1:09:46.556
You sure do love high places.

1:09:46.557 --> 1:09:50.102
I do all my best thinkingwhen I'm up high.

1:09:50.144 --> 1:09:52.938
What are you thinking about?

1:09:52.980 --> 1:09:58.986
Well, I'm thinking that besidesa few minor setbacks

1:09:59.028 --> 1:10:05.659
and being under a microscope, I had a really good cruise.

1:10:08.787 --> 1:10:12.374
I am always emotional.

1:10:12.416 --> 1:10:17.713
I feel like for the first timein my life

1:10:17.755 --> 1:10:22.635
I'm finally on solid ground.

1:10:22.676 --> 1:10:25.930
How ironic because we'rein the middle of the ocean

1:10:25.971 --> 1:10:28.265
[laughs]

1:10:28.307 --> 1:10:32.978
I guess we both had thingswe had to put behind us.

1:10:33.020 --> 1:10:35.104
Walls that needed to bebroken down

1:10:35.105 --> 1:10:37.607
Issues to overcome.

1:10:37.608 --> 1:10:41.110
Bags to store in the overheadcompartment.

1:10:41.111 --> 1:10:45.324
Maybe we finally made itto our destination

1:11:09.515 --> 1:11:13.936
And then, well, um... he kissed me.

1:11:13.978 --> 1:11:16.563
He kissed you?

1:11:16.605 --> 1:11:18.481
We got caught upin the moment.

1:11:18.482 --> 1:11:19.525
Hold on.

1:11:19.566 --> 1:11:20.526
But he kissed you?!

1:11:20.567 --> 1:11:21.819
Would you just shush!

1:11:21.860 --> 1:11:23.152
My Mom is right there.

1:11:23.153 --> 1:11:26.907
The last thing I want is herasking me more questions.

1:11:26.949 --> 1:11:28.324
I mean what's the point?

1:11:28.325 --> 1:11:32.204
We get off this ship in a coupledays and he stays onboard so...

1:11:32.246 --> 1:11:33.163
So.

1:11:33.164 --> 1:11:34.998
You finally open yourself up

1:11:34.999 --> 1:11:37.209
and the guy is geographicallyunavailable.

1:11:37.251 --> 1:11:39.628
So you kissed her.

1:11:39.670 --> 1:11:41.213
I knew it man. You like her.

1:11:41.255 --> 1:11:42.464
Okay, but it's not feasible.

1:11:42.506 --> 1:11:45.092
You have a month offbetween contracts dude

1:11:45.134 --> 1:11:47.052
Not when I'mthe cruise director

1:11:47.094 --> 1:11:49.012
I haven't seen you like somebodylike this since...

1:11:49.013 --> 1:11:49.847
Whoa.

1:11:49.848 --> 1:11:51.557
What does it matter?

1:11:51.598 --> 1:11:56.186
Listen you are only unavailableif you choose to be.

1:11:56.228 --> 1:11:58.187
Why do you choose to be?

1:11:58.188 --> 1:12:01.190
Maybe because I finally feellike I'm home?

1:12:01.191 --> 1:12:02.901
And if I give all this up andthat doesn't work out then

1:12:02.943 --> 1:12:04.820
what do I got?

1:12:04.862 --> 1:12:06.405
Nothing.

1:12:06.447 --> 1:12:07.864
Want some bartender advice?

1:12:07.865 --> 1:12:08.532
Have a drink.

1:12:08.574 --> 1:12:09.658
You seem stressed out.

1:12:09.700 --> 1:12:10.867
I'm going to work.

1:12:10.868 --> 1:12:12.035
I'll see you later.

1:12:12.036 --> 1:12:13.370
Yeah.

1:12:14.413 --> 1:12:17.416
And lastly judges Beckyand I made my special

1:12:17.458 --> 1:12:21.170
buffalo chicken potato saladin 15 minutes I might add,

1:12:21.211 --> 1:12:26.050
so who's it going to be? Becky, John or Fiona?

1:12:26.091 --> 1:12:28.510
It's a three-way tie! Everybody wins!

1:12:28.552 --> 1:12:32.890
[applause and cheers]

1:12:32.931 --> 1:12:34.516
And thank you so much for coming

1:12:34.558 --> 1:12:37.936
and making my firstLiving EasyAt SeaCruise so incredible.

1:12:37.978 --> 1:12:39.605
So now, let's eat.

1:12:39.646 --> 1:12:41.273
Okay, but before everybody goes

1:12:41.315 --> 1:12:43.275
if you could please fill outyour comment cards

1:12:43.317 --> 1:12:45.568
we would love yourconstructive criticism.

1:12:45.569 --> 1:12:48.822
Yes, but if you loved it, feel free to mention that too.

1:12:48.864 --> 1:12:50.240
Multiple times if you want to

1:12:50.282 --> 1:12:52.785
so that way I can comeagain next year.

1:12:52.826 --> 1:12:54.411
Thank you.

1:12:54.453 --> 1:12:56.079
[applause]

1:12:56.080 --> 1:12:58.581
There are a ton of disappointedguests in the dining room.

1:12:58.582 --> 1:13:00.417
They didn't know this had moved.

1:13:00.459 --> 1:13:02.711
I put notes undereveryone's doors.

1:13:02.753 --> 1:13:05.130
Yes, but you have to goabove and beyond, Tony.

1:13:05.172 --> 1:13:07.007
You make announcements.

1:13:07.049 --> 1:13:08.175
You track people down.

1:13:08.217 --> 1:13:09.718
I don't know.

1:13:09.760 --> 1:13:11.804
Maybe corporate was right.

1:13:11.845 --> 1:13:13.722
You're not ready.

1:13:14.431 --> 1:13:16.850
Hey. Hey, you knowthat's not your fault.

1:13:16.892 --> 1:13:18.101
I should have said something...

1:13:18.102 --> 1:13:19.602
No, you know I did my best,

1:13:19.603 --> 1:13:23.899
that's all I can do, and I amtired of trying to win her over.

1:13:23.941 --> 1:13:25.400
Look at me.

1:13:25.442 --> 1:13:27.903
You are great and ifshe doesn't see that,

1:13:27.945 --> 1:13:30.864
that's because she's crazy.

1:13:30.906 --> 1:13:33.325
I have one day left.

1:13:33.367 --> 1:13:38.122
Let's just enjoy every minuteof it.

1:13:38.163 --> 1:13:39.123
Okay.

1:13:39.124 --> 1:13:40.207
Okay.

1:13:40.249 --> 1:13:41.290
[Sigh]

1:13:41.291 --> 1:13:45.963
This trip went so fastbut what a great time.

1:13:46.004 --> 1:13:48.131
You know, Wes isa good guy Mom.

1:13:48.132 --> 1:13:50.676
You two lookreally good together.

1:13:50.717 --> 1:13:55.055
I really appreciateyou saying that.

1:13:55.097 --> 1:13:56.682
What's on your mind Livvy?

1:13:56.723 --> 1:14:00.561
One very handsomecruise director perhaps?

1:14:00.602 --> 1:14:02.729
What am I supposed to do, mom?

1:14:02.771 --> 1:14:06.775
See him once a week for threehours in between cruises?

1:14:06.817 --> 1:14:10.153
It's definitely a complicatedscenario.

1:14:10.154 --> 1:14:11.196
But at least I'm happy to see

1:14:11.238 --> 1:14:15.159
that you're openingyour heart again.

1:14:15.200 --> 1:14:17.160
Am I though?

1:14:17.161 --> 1:14:21.290
Or did I just let him inbecause he was easy and safe?

1:14:21.331 --> 1:14:23.125
Because I knew this hadan expiration date?

1:14:23.167 --> 1:14:26.336
Because there's Mileswho's a good guy,

1:14:26.378 --> 1:14:34.428
he's nice and he lives near meand I am completely unsure.

1:14:34.470 --> 1:14:37.139
Then it looks like you haveto ask yourself

1:14:37.181 --> 1:14:38.848
what would makeyou happy?

1:14:38.849 --> 1:14:42.019
Who would make you happy?

1:14:42.060 --> 1:14:46.565
And then you have to leap.

1:14:48.525 --> 1:14:50.944
Don't forget to put your bagsout tonight, honey.

1:14:52.196 --> 1:14:53.655
I have to say my favourite partof the job

1:14:53.697 --> 1:14:55.699
is just meeting peoplefrom all over the world.

1:14:55.741 --> 1:14:58.534
So many different languages.

1:14:58.535 --> 1:15:02.039
I'm learning a lot everywhere...

1:15:11.757 --> 1:15:15.677
Uh, yeah, and I gotta saythat my French

1:15:15.719 --> 1:15:16.970
is probably my favourite.

1:15:17.012 --> 1:15:19.139
Buenos Dias muchachos!

1:15:19.181 --> 1:15:20.390
Buenos Dias seniorita.

1:15:20.432 --> 1:15:21.475
Hola!

1:15:32.611 --> 1:15:35.989
What is it about waterthat makes it so soothing, huh?

1:15:39.368 --> 1:15:41.662
That it has no rough edges,

1:15:41.703 --> 1:15:45.082
just kinda flowsthe ways it flows.

1:15:45.123 --> 1:15:46.166
I think we could all benefit

1:15:46.208 --> 1:15:49.585
from being a little bit morelike that.

1:15:49.586 --> 1:15:53.131
You seem different thanwhen you first got here.

1:15:53.173 --> 1:15:57.260
Yeah, yeah, I feel likewhen I got on the ship

1:15:57.261 --> 1:16:00.222
just this old phaseof me ended

1:16:00.264 --> 1:16:01.431
and I'm on the vergeof something

1:16:01.473 --> 1:16:03.350
I'm just not really sure what.

1:16:03.392 --> 1:16:06.061
What you're on the vergeof is huge success!

1:16:06.103 --> 1:16:07.603
And this articleand the response

1:16:07.604 --> 1:16:11.525
to all the live videos are goingto do wonders for you.

1:16:11.567 --> 1:16:15.153
I know.

1:16:15.195 --> 1:16:19.199
I just don't really knowif I want that anymore.

1:16:19.241 --> 1:16:21.535
Olivia that's crazy.

1:16:21.577 --> 1:16:22.953
This is your business.

1:16:22.995 --> 1:16:26.164
It's what you've beenworking for.

1:16:26.206 --> 1:16:28.000
Don't let anyone change that.

1:16:28.041 --> 1:16:32.671
Oh, no, I'm not, it's just, what's the point?

1:16:32.713 --> 1:16:35.966
If it doesn't make you happy, you even said so yourself,

1:16:36.008 --> 1:16:37.467
you're tired of moving.

1:16:37.509 --> 1:16:40.012
Yeah, but I was just venting.

1:16:40.053 --> 1:16:43.682
Like I said, I preferthe creature comforts.

1:16:43.724 --> 1:16:45.309
Look, sometimes we haveto sacrifice

1:16:45.350 --> 1:16:48.103
just for a little stability.

1:16:48.145 --> 1:16:52.858
I guess I just want to be a partof something bigger than me.

1:16:52.899 --> 1:16:54.943
Find a place that I belong.

1:16:56.987 --> 1:16:58.572
Look.

1:16:58.613 --> 1:17:01.700
I've watched you on this cruise.

1:17:01.742 --> 1:17:04.995
I see the way you lookat that Tony guy

1:17:05.037 --> 1:17:07.122
but it doesn't make sense.

1:17:07.164 --> 1:17:10.417
You and I, we make sense.

1:17:10.459 --> 1:17:12.168
We live near each other.

1:17:12.169 --> 1:17:13.670
We have similar interests.

1:17:13.712 --> 1:17:15.338
We know we get along.

1:17:15.339 --> 1:17:17.466
You got past whatever you gotpast this week with him

1:17:17.507 --> 1:17:19.134
and that's great.

1:17:21.845 --> 1:17:23.639
We're getting offthis ship soon.

1:17:23.680 --> 1:17:25.223
Let's get off together.

1:17:26.850 --> 1:17:29.603
Because that makes sense.

1:17:30.520 --> 1:17:33.231
I think you're so great.

1:17:33.273 --> 1:17:39.488
I just, I need time to justfigure out what this new me is.

1:17:41.531 --> 1:17:44.700
Well, if you ask me,

1:17:44.701 --> 1:17:47.621
I don't think there neededto be a new you.

1:18:13.230 --> 1:18:13.939
Paula!

1:18:13.980 --> 1:18:14.940
Hi I've been looking for you.

1:18:14.981 --> 1:18:16.358
Olivia, is everything alright?

1:18:16.400 --> 1:18:18.067
I don't want to tell you howto do your job

1:18:18.068 --> 1:18:21.405
but there's something I needto show you.

1:18:21.446 --> 1:18:23.824
Alexandra's comment cards.

1:18:30.247 --> 1:18:33.125
Oh.

1:18:33.166 --> 1:18:34.917
I'll take theseunder consideration.

1:18:34.918 --> 1:18:36.545
Thank you.

1:18:40.966 --> 1:18:42.050
[knocking on door]

1:18:42.092 --> 1:18:43.009
Hey.

1:18:43.051 --> 1:18:44.469
Hey Tony.

1:18:44.511 --> 1:18:50.267
Alright, so I am wise enoughto admit when I am wrong.

1:18:53.103 --> 1:18:54.646
What are you talking about?

1:18:54.688 --> 1:18:57.941
I put some unfair expectationson you.

1:18:57.983 --> 1:19:00.861
I know how tricky an eventscruise can be

1:19:00.902 --> 1:19:03.738
and if that is your first one,

1:19:03.780 --> 1:19:10.412
maybe, maybe I'm the onewho should have bent a little.

1:19:10.454 --> 1:19:12.289
I really appreciate yousaying that.

1:19:12.330 --> 1:19:15.167
And I just heard backfrom corporate.

1:19:15.208 --> 1:19:18.462
They're willing to offer youa six-month contract to start.

1:19:18.503 --> 1:19:20.589
The Harmony of the Seasis yours,

1:19:20.630 --> 1:19:24.092
if you still want it.

1:19:24.134 --> 1:19:26.178
Uh yes, yes!

1:19:26.219 --> 1:19:27.220
Wow.

1:19:27.262 --> 1:19:28.638
I want this.

1:19:28.680 --> 1:19:30.806
This is where I belong.

1:19:30.807 --> 1:19:33.309
I, um, thank you.

1:19:33.310 --> 1:19:34.311
You're welcome.

1:19:34.352 --> 1:19:36.688
And congratulations Tony.

1:19:42.152 --> 1:19:43.653
[exhales]

1:19:45.530 --> 1:19:47.240
Hey! Tony!

1:19:47.282 --> 1:19:48.325
There you are.

1:19:48.366 --> 1:19:50.659
I've been looking for you.

1:19:50.660 --> 1:19:51.745
Last day.

1:20:01.421 --> 1:20:02.130
That's amazing.

1:20:02.172 --> 1:20:03.839
I'm so happy for you.

1:20:03.840 --> 1:20:08.220

1:20:12.015 --> 1:20:13.683
Maybe you can even goto your father's hotel

1:20:13.725 --> 1:20:16.311
with a handsome reporteron your arm.

1:20:16.353 --> 1:20:18.980
Show your ex.

1:20:19.022 --> 1:20:22.191
I really hope you can showthem all, Olivia.

1:20:22.192 --> 1:20:25.278
What are you talking about?

1:20:25.320 --> 1:20:27.697
You and Miles.

1:20:27.739 --> 1:20:30.617
I mean you guys lookamazing together.

1:20:30.659 --> 1:20:35.538
I'm really glad that you foundwhat you were looking for.

1:20:35.539 --> 1:20:36.706
That's what I wantfor all my guests.

1:20:36.748 --> 1:20:40.502
I want them to leave refreshedand renewed.

1:20:42.337 --> 1:20:44.631
Is that what I am to you?

1:20:44.673 --> 1:20:48.510
Just a guest?

1:20:48.552 --> 1:20:50.637
What else would you be?

1:20:56.268 --> 1:21:00.188
Must be pretty convenientfor you.

1:21:00.230 --> 1:21:06.152
Always making connections, one cruise at a time.

1:21:06.194 --> 1:21:10.448
Always sailing around but neveractually arriving anywhere.

1:21:14.619 --> 1:21:18.290
Thank you Tony for helping mefind me.

1:21:18.331 --> 1:21:21.126
I hope that one day you can stopsailing and you can arrive

1:21:21.167 --> 1:21:25.714
because that's when you're gonnafind where you really belong.

1:21:25.755 --> 1:21:28.091
That's when you'll get home.

1:21:38.059 --> 1:21:39.144
And on behalf of RoyalCaribbean

1:21:39.185 --> 1:21:40.437

1:21:47.903 --> 1:21:51.907

1:21:56.077 --> 1:21:57.454
Thank you.

1:22:10.175 --> 1:22:11.843
[chuckles]

1:22:36.201 --> 1:22:39.037
Hey. Hope you hada good cruise.

1:22:40.664 --> 1:22:41.373
Oh!

1:22:41.414 --> 1:22:42.457
I was just coming to find you.

1:22:42.499 --> 1:22:43.208
Do you have a minute?

1:22:43.249 --> 1:22:44.167
Of course.

1:22:44.168 --> 1:22:45.335
I have an idea

1:22:45.377 --> 1:22:46.920
and we probably have to run itthrough corporate.

1:22:46.962 --> 1:22:50.006
It's your ship now Tonyand I'm all ears.

1:22:50.048 --> 1:22:51.173
Okay.

1:22:51.174 --> 1:22:52.258
Great. Let's go.

1:22:52.300 --> 1:22:53.343
So.

1:23:01.267 --> 1:23:02.811
[knocking]

1:23:07.857 --> 1:23:10.276
Olivia?

1:23:10.318 --> 1:23:11.027
Hey.

1:23:11.028 --> 1:23:12.737
Did they already check out?

1:23:19.869 --> 1:23:23.205
Olivia hey, it's Tony again.

1:23:23.206 --> 1:23:27.043
Please call me even if you'vealready disembarked which you

1:23:27.085 --> 1:23:30.255
probably have because everybodyhas except a few stragglers.

1:23:30.296 --> 1:23:33.800
I need to talk to you. It's important.

1:23:53.236 --> 1:23:55.363
Do you like what you see?

1:23:57.741 --> 1:24:00.994
Her beauty takesyour breath away.

1:24:01.036 --> 1:24:05.915
I don't think I'll ever get usedto calling a ship her or a she.

1:24:05.957 --> 1:24:09.753
As much as I love this ship,

1:24:09.794 --> 1:24:12.922
I wasn't actually talkingabout her.

1:24:14.299 --> 1:24:17.886
You know, no one's ever peggedme the way you did, Olivia.

1:24:17.927 --> 1:24:19.763
Ever.

1:24:19.804 --> 1:24:23.057
Maybe it's because we're alike.

1:24:23.099 --> 1:24:24.142
It's crazy.

1:24:24.184 --> 1:24:27.187
You walked on to my ship

1:24:27.228 --> 1:24:33.610
and you somehow changedeverything for me.

1:24:33.651 --> 1:24:35.111
How so?

1:24:35.153 --> 1:24:37.947
You made me rethinkabout where I belong.

1:24:37.989 --> 1:24:40.950
Someone once told me thatbelonging is not necessarily

1:24:40.992 --> 1:24:46.039
about the where, but it's about the who.

1:24:48.166 --> 1:24:49.667
Me with you.

1:24:49.709 --> 1:24:51.920
This is where I belong.

1:25:03.014 --> 1:25:05.391
I have an idea and I wantto run it by you.

1:25:05.433 --> 1:25:10.688
Just sort of a way that we couldhave our cake and eat it too.

1:25:10.730 --> 1:25:12.315
We just spent thiswhole cruise eating

1:25:12.357 --> 1:25:14.526
and you want me to thinkabout cake.

1:25:14.567 --> 1:25:18.238
I think you're really goingto like this idea.

1:25:18.279 --> 1:25:19.155
Okay?

1:25:19.197 --> 1:25:20.532
Yeah.

1:25:22.575 --> 1:25:24.202
