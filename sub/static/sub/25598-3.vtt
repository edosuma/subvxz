WEBVTT

00:01.366 --> 00:02.734
I'm here because
I want you to come home.

00:02.735 --> 00:03.525
Back to the firm?

00:03.526 --> 00:04.673
Yes, and not only that,

00:04.674 --> 00:05.955
you can get the ten
best associates

00:05.955 --> 00:07.630
from Robert Zane's
stable to come with you.

00:07.631 --> 00:08.939
And what's in this for me?

00:08.940 --> 00:10.906
I'll make sure that you are
the youngest senior partner

00:10.907 --> 00:11.705
we've ever had.

00:11.706 --> 00:14.311
As of this morning,
we're merging with Robert Zane.

00:14.312 --> 00:15.624
When I came over,
you said my name

00:15.625 --> 00:16.958
would be the
one to go up next.

00:16.960 --> 00:17.859
You have my word.

00:17.861 --> 00:19.260
Your name goes up next.

00:19.262 --> 00:21.095
Alex, what are you doing?

00:21.097 --> 00:22.730
I'm going through every one
of Samantha Wheeler's files,

00:22.732 --> 00:24.765
'cause a fight's coming,
and I'm gonna be ready.

00:24.767 --> 00:27.068
Katrina, are you sure
you're gonna be okay

00:27.070 --> 00:28.936
firing people
you've worked with for years?

00:28.938 --> 00:30.004
I'll tell you
what I told Louis,

00:30.006 --> 00:32.006
that if I'm going to grow
in my role here,

00:32.008 --> 00:33.808
this is something I'm going
to have to learn to do.

00:33.810 --> 00:36.043
I gave you an order,
and you blatantly ignored me.

00:36.045 --> 00:38.045
I did do what you
originally asked:

00:38.047 --> 00:40.092
to objectively evaluate
the associates.

00:40.093 --> 00:42.226
I don't care.
Brian is staying.

00:42.228 --> 00:44.929
Gavin Andrews is a hell of a
lot more than meets the eye.

00:44.931 --> 00:47.799
And a guy with your history
would want to be more careful

00:47.801 --> 00:49.867
about who he gets
into bed with.

00:49.869 --> 00:50.902
Tell me what
you're talking about,

00:50.904 --> 00:53.237
or get out
of my goddamn office.

00:53.239 --> 00:55.707
I admit I'm starting to see
what you see in her.

00:55.709 --> 00:57.075
That's all I was hoping for.

00:57.077 --> 00:58.743
Now I can tell you
why I was hoping it.

00:58.745 --> 01:00.144
What haven't you told me?

01:00.146 --> 01:01.879
Her name goes
up on the wall next.

01:05.051 --> 01:06.641
I mean,
how was I supposed to know

01:06.642 --> 01:07.841
she was married?
- I don't know,

01:07.843 --> 01:09.676
maybe her wedding ring
could have tipped you off.

01:09.678 --> 01:10.844
Mm.

01:10.846 --> 01:13.313
I was 23, you know?

01:13.315 --> 01:15.015
I wasn't looking
at no damn rings.

01:15.017 --> 01:17.484
You really had some balls
when you were younger.

01:17.486 --> 01:19.920
Still do,
thank you very much.

01:19.922 --> 01:22.322
Now, why don't you get to it?

01:22.324 --> 01:24.958
- Why don't I get to what?
- Harvey, you've got plenty

01:24.960 --> 01:28.228
of friends to have drinks with,
most of them prettier than me.

01:28.230 --> 01:29.663
You've got something
on your mind.

01:29.665 --> 01:32.232
Let's hear it.
- Robert, do you remember

01:32.234 --> 01:33.934
when you told me
you promised Samantha

01:33.936 --> 01:35.769
her name would go up next?
- I do.

01:35.771 --> 01:39.406
I made Alex the same promise.

01:39.408 --> 01:42.509
- Why you telling me now?
- Because we're partners.

01:42.511 --> 01:46.646
I don't want to keep
any secrets from my partner.

01:46.648 --> 01:49.182
Then I guess there's only
one thing to do.

01:49.184 --> 01:51.685
- What's that?
- Kick the can down the road.

01:51.687 --> 01:53.854
Because there's no way
both of us are gonna be able

01:53.856 --> 01:56.123
to keep that promise,
and for all we know,

01:56.125 --> 01:58.825
one of them could get hit
by a bus before we have

01:58.827 --> 02:00.627
to make that call.
- Then I guess

02:00.629 --> 02:01.962
it's a good thing
both our names

02:01.964 --> 02:05.165
are already up there.
- Sure is.

02:05.167 --> 02:08.368
- Another drink?
- Yeah, make it a double.

02:08.370 --> 02:10.270
And where are you going?

02:10.271 --> 02:13.740
To make room for that double.

02:15.110 --> 02:16.343
Excuse me, would you mind
giving me a minute to...?

02:16.345 --> 02:19.880
Oh, I'm so sorry, I--
I didn't hear you come in.

02:19.882 --> 02:23.283
Um, I'll just go.
- Are you all right?

02:23.285 --> 02:24.885
Uh, yeah.

02:24.887 --> 02:27.988
I, um--I just got a phone call.

02:27.990 --> 02:30.390
Um, it's not important.

02:30.392 --> 02:32.526
Excuse me.
- No, you stay.

02:32.528 --> 02:34.361
I'll use the one downstairs.

02:34.363 --> 02:37.364
Take as long as you need.

02:37.366 --> 02:40.901
For what it's worth...

02:40.903 --> 02:43.236
I hope everything's okay.

02:45.641 --> 02:48.675
Thank you.

02:50.712 --> 02:53.113
What are you doing
in my home?

02:53.115 --> 02:55.682
I'm here because I have a way
to get your Renoir back,

02:55.684 --> 02:57.350
but I'm gonna need something
from you.

02:57.352 --> 02:59.252
- And what exactly is that?
- Give your ex the villa

02:59.254 --> 03:01.588
in Bordeaux, and guarantee
she never pays a nickel

03:01.590 --> 03:03.890
of upkeep.
- And why would I do that?

03:03.892 --> 03:05.692
Because you asked me
to get that painting back

03:05.694 --> 03:07.327
and this is the only way
that's gonna happen.

03:07.329 --> 03:08.962
No, I mean
why would I do that

03:08.964 --> 03:11.531
when your firm is about
to sign my biggest competitor?

03:11.533 --> 03:13.667
- What are you talking about?
- I just learned

03:13.669 --> 03:15.502
Samantha Wheeler's about
to sign Delta.

03:15.504 --> 03:16.937
- God damn it.
- See, I thought

03:16.939 --> 03:18.672
I made it clear
that if I sign with you

03:18.674 --> 03:20.273
it is because I trust you.

03:20.275 --> 03:22.275
Using me as a stalking horse
doesn't make me feel like

03:22.277 --> 03:23.710
I can trust you.
- Gavin, that's not

03:23.712 --> 03:25.445
what's going on here.
- I told you,

03:25.447 --> 03:27.614
that painting
is personal to me.

03:27.616 --> 03:29.549
I'm gonna tell you why.

03:29.551 --> 03:31.184
My father was not
a wealthy man,

03:31.186 --> 03:33.253
but he had an education.

03:33.255 --> 03:34.721
If there's one thing
he appreciated

03:34.723 --> 03:37.490
more than anything, it was art.

03:37.492 --> 03:39.326
Every Sunday, we'd go
to a different gallery.

03:39.328 --> 03:40.860
We'd walk through--
he would tell me

03:40.862 --> 03:43.296
everything he knew
about every painting there was.

03:43.298 --> 03:45.298
You know who
his favorite artist was?

03:45.300 --> 03:46.967
Renoir.

03:46.969 --> 03:48.969
I paid $8 million
for that painting.

03:48.971 --> 03:52.472
It's worth twice that now,
but I would never sell it...

03:52.474 --> 03:57.777
because every time
I look at it...

03:57.779 --> 03:59.646
I think of him.

03:59.648 --> 04:02.382
Gavin, I told you
I'll get that painting back

04:02.384 --> 04:03.583
and I will.

04:03.585 --> 04:05.085
And I'll tell you
something else--

04:05.087 --> 04:06.620
There's no way
Samantha Wheeler's signing

04:06.622 --> 04:08.788
Delta goddamn Airlines.

04:11.994 --> 04:14.094
Thanks.

04:14.096 --> 04:16.730
Alex, what a pleasant surprise.

04:16.732 --> 04:18.298
Cut the bullshit.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.100
I just found out you're going
after Delta Airlines.

04:20.101 --> 04:21.901
Not just going after,
it's practically a done deal.

04:21.903 --> 04:24.104
That was fast,
since you only talked to Delta

04:24.106 --> 04:26.172
after you found out
I was pursuing Gavin Andrews.

04:26.174 --> 04:27.641
One had nothing
to do with the other.

04:27.643 --> 04:29.743
And I said cut the bullshit.

04:29.745 --> 04:32.145
You did this because you knew
you'd either sign Delta

04:32.147 --> 04:34.414
and I'd be out in the cold,
or Gavin Andrews

04:34.416 --> 04:36.283
would accuse me of using him
as a stalking horse

04:36.285 --> 04:38.685
and I'd be out in the cold.
- If you're so sure of that,

04:38.687 --> 04:40.287
then what are you doing
standing here

04:40.289 --> 04:42.188
ruining my morning bagel?
- I'm here to tell you

04:42.190 --> 04:43.556
to back the hell off.

04:43.558 --> 04:44.391
Well, that's not
gonna happen.

04:44.393 --> 04:45.425
Listen to me.

04:45.427 --> 04:46.493
I don't know
how you did things before,

04:46.495 --> 04:48.762
but around here,
we don't stab each other

04:48.764 --> 04:49.996
in the back.
- Then what do you call

04:49.998 --> 04:52.499
going after my old client
for the sole purpose

04:52.501 --> 04:54.868
of making me look bad?

04:54.870 --> 04:56.703
Because I'm not gonna
let that slide.

04:56.705 --> 04:58.805
Not to mention I warned you

04:58.807 --> 05:00.206
Gavin Andrews
isn't worth the trouble.

05:00.208 --> 05:01.174
You don't want to look bad,

05:01.176 --> 05:02.575
or the client's
too much trouble?

05:02.577 --> 05:04.344
Which one is it?
- It's both,

05:04.346 --> 05:06.146
and if you can't see that
then it's not my problem.

05:06.148 --> 05:09.349
What I see is you standing
between me and a client,

05:09.351 --> 05:11.985
and if I were you, I'd get
the hell out of the way.

05:11.987 --> 05:13.687
Well, then you'd better
sign your guy fast,

05:13.689 --> 05:15.155
because I'm already on
the one-yard line with mine

05:15.157 --> 05:17.761
and I'm about to punch it in.

Hey.

06:00.120 --> 06:02.120
Good morning, Robert.
- It will be

06:02.122 --> 06:04.322
once this damn hangover
wears off.

06:04.324 --> 06:07.458
- Out late last night, yo?
- Uh, no, I was here

06:07.460 --> 06:10.061
forgetting my age
and matching Harvey

06:10.063 --> 06:11.729
drink for drink.

06:11.731 --> 06:13.598
Now, what can I do for you?
- Robert, you know,

06:13.600 --> 06:15.299
if you're hungover, I can whip
up my nana's special remedy.

06:15.301 --> 06:17.368
I just need some sugar, tea,
a little steamed milk,

06:17.370 --> 06:18.803
and, of course,
two of my cuticles.

06:18.805 --> 06:20.471
Thanks, but I'd rather
have the hangover.

06:20.473 --> 06:21.839
It's about the tea, isn't it?

06:21.841 --> 06:23.041
Because she's from
the old country

06:23.043 --> 06:24.475
and I can substitute--
- Louis.

06:24.477 --> 06:26.678
What in God's name
did you come in here for?

06:26.680 --> 06:28.479
Okay. Robert.

06:28.481 --> 06:30.815
The other day
when I was feeling left out,

06:30.817 --> 06:34.085
you and Harvey let me know
that you clocked me.

06:34.087 --> 06:36.521
Well, I realized
that there's someone

06:36.523 --> 06:38.423
that I haven't been clocking.

06:38.425 --> 06:40.191
- What are you talking about?
- When I brought Katrina over

06:40.193 --> 06:42.493
from you, I told her
that she was gonna be

06:42.495 --> 06:43.995
the youngest senior partner
in firm history,

06:43.997 --> 06:45.897
and I want
to fulfill that promise.

06:45.899 --> 06:47.165
Now, let me
get this straight:

06:47.167 --> 06:49.500
you're holding me
to a promise you made to her

06:49.502 --> 06:51.202
so that you could steal her
from me.

06:51.204 --> 06:52.804
Robert, that's not the point
and you know it.

06:52.806 --> 06:55.373
Katrina is a great lawyer,
and it's time.

06:55.375 --> 06:57.875
Maybe it is time,
but senior partner

06:57.877 --> 07:00.344
isn't just "lawyering," Louis.

07:00.346 --> 07:02.280
It's about managing people,
and I don't know

07:02.282 --> 07:03.915
how good Katrina Bennett is
with people.

07:03.917 --> 07:05.550
Well, then you tell me.

07:05.552 --> 07:07.919
What can she do
to prove herself to you?

07:11.925 --> 07:13.558
Excuse me, Mr. Specter?

07:13.560 --> 07:16.227
- I know you, you're--
- From last night.

07:16.229 --> 07:17.862
I, uh...

07:17.864 --> 07:19.864
wanted to return this.

07:19.866 --> 07:21.733
You were very kind.
Thank you.

07:21.735 --> 07:23.067
It's nothing.
I was just hoping

07:23.069 --> 07:25.069
everything was okay.
- Actually,

07:25.071 --> 07:27.205
that's the reason
that I'm here.

07:27.207 --> 07:29.640
- What do you mean?
- I was upset last night

07:29.642 --> 07:31.976
because I got a call
from my mother.

07:31.978 --> 07:35.413
She needs an operation,
and I can't afford it.

07:35.415 --> 07:36.881
What are you asking me?

07:36.883 --> 07:39.117
I've worked
enough overtime hours

07:39.119 --> 07:41.119
to make having
that operation possible,

07:41.121 --> 07:43.755
but they won't pay me overtime
because my title

07:43.757 --> 07:46.290
is Facilities Manager.

07:46.292 --> 07:47.992
I don't manage anything.

07:47.994 --> 07:50.294
I was hoping maybe...
- I'd be able

07:50.296 --> 07:53.498
to get you your money.
- Yes.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.566
- Listen, Miss...?
- Anna.

07:55.568 --> 07:58.269
Anna Reed.
- Anna, your employer

07:58.271 --> 08:00.838
is my landlord,
so if I get involved

08:00.840 --> 08:02.607
things could get
very complicated.

08:02.609 --> 08:06.077
But it's a simple matter
of paying me for my work.

08:06.079 --> 08:07.912
If that were true,
why would he listen to me

08:07.914 --> 08:09.981
when he didn't listen to you?

08:09.983 --> 08:12.817
Because people like me
don't matter

08:12.819 --> 08:14.819
to people like them.

08:14.821 --> 08:18.589
I'm just the lady
that cleans their toilet.

08:18.591 --> 08:20.758
Please, Mr. Specter.

08:20.760 --> 08:24.495
I'm not proud
to ask you for this

08:24.497 --> 08:26.998
but my mother needs this,
and when it comes

08:27.000 --> 08:29.500
to taking care of people
we love,

08:29.502 --> 08:32.837
pride has no place.

08:32.839 --> 08:35.173
Okay.

08:35.174 --> 08:38.142
I can't promise anything,
but I'll try.

08:38.144 --> 08:39.277
Thank you.

08:39.279 --> 08:42.313
I knew you were kind.

08:47.954 --> 08:50.221
Don't tell me you're dating
the cleaning woman now.

08:50.223 --> 08:53.357
- And what if I was?
- I'd say congratulations.

08:53.359 --> 08:54.959
But why don't you tell me
why she was here.

08:54.961 --> 08:56.861
I ran into her
in the bathroom last night.

08:56.863 --> 08:58.462
She was crying.

08:58.464 --> 09:00.031
The building isn't paying her
what she's owed,

09:00.033 --> 09:01.566
and she asked me
to look into it.

09:01.568 --> 09:03.401
You mean, she asked you
to pick a fight

09:03.403 --> 09:04.869
with our landlord,
who I shouldn't have

09:04.871 --> 09:06.637
to tell you
is a mean son of a bitch,

09:06.639 --> 09:08.639
and this is a bad idea.
- Robert, I'm not an idiot,

09:08.641 --> 09:10.842
and I'm not picking any fights
with David Fox.

09:10.844 --> 09:12.677
I'm gonna talk to the man
for two minutes.

09:12.679 --> 09:15.346
If he doesn't see it my way,
that's it.

09:15.348 --> 09:17.815
Trust me.

09:17.817 --> 09:19.684
Okay, Harvey.

09:19.686 --> 09:22.820
I trust you.

09:29.162 --> 09:31.429
There you are.
Been looking all over for you.

09:31.431 --> 09:34.065
Louis, if there's any chance
whatever it is can wait...

09:34.067 --> 09:35.333
It can't.
I need you to supervise

09:35.335 --> 09:36.734
Brian Altman.
- What?

09:36.736 --> 09:38.336
Louis, I am in the middle
of a case,

09:38.338 --> 09:40.037
and there is a huge meeting
in an hour.

09:40.039 --> 09:41.072
Well, then have him
help you with it.

09:41.074 --> 09:42.773
I don't need any help,
and I can't

09:42.775 --> 09:44.175
be mentoring someone right now.

09:44.177 --> 09:45.843
It's not mentoring;
it's managing.

09:45.845 --> 09:48.079
Then have someone else
manage him.

09:48.081 --> 09:49.213
Damn it, Katrina,
this is your chance

09:49.215 --> 09:51.382
to be senior partner.

09:51.384 --> 09:52.850
- Oh, my God.
- That's right.

09:52.852 --> 09:54.218
I just talked to Robert Zane
about making good

09:54.220 --> 09:55.920
on my promise to you.
and I shouldn't even

09:55.922 --> 09:57.021
be telling you this--
no one can know.

09:57.023 --> 09:58.856
He's on board
as long as you can show

09:58.858 --> 10:00.958
that you are a manager.

10:00.960 --> 10:02.860
Okay, uh...

10:02.862 --> 10:04.428
Look, then just do me a favor.

10:04.430 --> 10:06.397
Please just tell Brian
to familiarize himself

10:06.399 --> 10:08.065
with Bigelow Textiles
and meet me

10:08.067 --> 10:10.067
in the conference room
in 45 minutes.

10:10.069 --> 10:12.236
Katrina,
is something going on?

10:12.238 --> 10:13.504
Why would something
be going on?

10:13.506 --> 10:14.972
I don't know,
'cause I just told you

10:14.974 --> 10:16.007
that your dreams
are coming true

10:16.009 --> 10:18.442
and it looks like
you ate a bad clam.

10:18.444 --> 10:20.544
I'm sorry, Louis.

10:20.546 --> 10:24.215
This is amazing news.
I'm just crunched for time.

10:24.217 --> 10:26.817
So, please, just tell Brian
to be there

10:26.819 --> 10:30.254
and I will handle him
from here on out.

10:30.256 --> 10:32.690
Okay, I'll let him know.

10:38.898 --> 10:40.498
David Fox.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.066
I'm Harvey Specter.

10:42.068 --> 10:44.068
Of, uh, Something,
Something, Specter Litt?

10:44.070 --> 10:45.803
Don't tell me
us changing our name

10:45.805 --> 10:48.406
is gonna be an issue again.
- No, it's not.

10:48.408 --> 10:50.408
Donna Paulsen saw to that
in your new lease.

10:50.410 --> 10:52.310
Well, Donna has a way
of getting what she wants.

10:52.312 --> 10:53.978
Speaking of what people want,
why don't you tell me

10:53.980 --> 10:55.780
why you're here.
- I need your help.

10:55.782 --> 10:57.548
There's a cleaning woman
on our floor

10:57.550 --> 10:59.483
who can't afford to pay
her mother's medical bills.

10:59.485 --> 11:02.286
Turns out technically
she's a facilities manager,

11:02.288 --> 11:04.455
which means she's not eligible
to make overtime.

11:04.457 --> 11:06.123
A maid
with a manager's title.

11:06.125 --> 11:07.858
I mean, sounds to me
like she's being empowered.

11:07.860 --> 11:10.094
You and I both know
that title is just a way

11:10.096 --> 11:11.829
to get around paying
what she's earned.

11:11.831 --> 11:13.631
- I don't know any such thing.
- Oh, bullshit.

11:13.633 --> 11:14.665
She's your employee.
- Wrong.

11:14.667 --> 11:15.900
I contract
all my cleaning services out

11:15.902 --> 11:18.302
to another company,
a company I don't run.

11:18.304 --> 11:20.104
You're gonna tell me
that company is anything more

11:20.106 --> 11:21.572
than a piece of paper
and a PO Box?

11:21.574 --> 11:22.974
Why don't you pay them
a visit and find out?

11:22.976 --> 11:24.775
Listen, David,
all I'm asking

11:24.777 --> 11:26.310
is do the right thing.

11:26.312 --> 11:28.145
Pay her for her work.
- You know,

11:28.147 --> 11:29.714
why don't you reach
into your own pocket?

11:29.716 --> 11:30.948
'Cause that's what
you're asking me to do.

11:30.950 --> 11:33.451
And I do this for her,
I gotta do it for everyone.

11:33.453 --> 11:34.885
And if you don't
do it for her,

11:34.887 --> 11:36.620
you will have to do it
for everyone.

11:36.622 --> 11:38.789
You'd better watch
what you say to me,

11:38.791 --> 11:40.358
'cause in case you forgot,
you're still living

11:40.360 --> 11:42.226
under my roof.
- And if you don't back off,

11:42.228 --> 11:44.428
I'll take that roof
and everything else you have,

11:44.430 --> 11:46.397
because you just violated
half-a-dozen laws

11:46.399 --> 11:48.399
by threatening a tenant.
- You want to take me on,

11:48.401 --> 11:50.568
you go for it,
'cause I didn't get where I am

11:50.570 --> 11:52.103
by letting people like you
push me around.

11:52.105 --> 11:53.971
Last time,
Donna kicked your ass.

11:53.973 --> 11:55.706
Well, I'm not Donna,

11:55.708 --> 11:59.176
so you pay my client
what you owe her.

12:02.181 --> 12:03.848
- Alex.
- We need to talk

12:03.850 --> 12:05.750
about Samantha Wheeler.

12:05.752 --> 12:07.918
- What does that mean?
- It means she's making a play

12:07.920 --> 12:10.021
for Delta Airlines,
and I want you to stop her.

12:10.023 --> 12:12.023
Delta would be a huge client;
why would I want to stop her?

12:12.025 --> 12:13.657
Because she only went
after them to stop me

12:13.659 --> 12:15.159
from signing Gavin Andrews,
and team mates

12:15.161 --> 12:16.560
don't do that to each other.

12:16.562 --> 12:18.229
This team mate talk
sounds great,

12:18.231 --> 12:19.930
but you just went after
one of her old clients.

12:19.932 --> 12:21.732
I didn't choose Gavin
because he was hers.

12:21.734 --> 12:23.901
I chose Gavin because
he was the most valuable client

12:23.903 --> 12:25.503
to Robert Zane.

12:25.505 --> 12:27.138
The fact that he was hers
just wasn't gonna stop me.

12:27.140 --> 12:28.706
Wasn't gonna stop you,
or was icing on the cake?

12:28.708 --> 12:30.274
What difference
does that make?

12:30.276 --> 12:32.109
Well, considering
what you're asking me to do,

12:32.111 --> 12:33.744
it makes all the difference.
- Louis, after Zane ended up

12:33.746 --> 12:36.180
as managing partner
I wanted to take her on,

12:36.182 --> 12:38.582
but you said I should make
a friend of Zane instead.

12:38.584 --> 12:40.451
So I went after Gavin
to impress Robert,

12:40.453 --> 12:42.453
and if you're not
gonna stop her, I might as well

12:42.455 --> 12:43.621
just have gone after her
in the first place.

12:43.623 --> 12:45.356
All right, Alex, okay.

12:45.358 --> 12:47.258
But giving up a client
with eight-figure billables

12:47.260 --> 12:49.293
is going out on one hell
of a limb, so I do this,

12:49.295 --> 12:51.028
you better deliver
Gavin Andrews.

12:51.030 --> 12:52.596
I will, Louis.

12:52.598 --> 12:54.732
You have my word.

13:01.541 --> 13:03.241
Samantha Wheeler.

13:03.243 --> 13:04.843
You and I need
to have a little chat.

13:04.845 --> 13:06.511
Louis Litt.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

13:06.513 --> 13:09.014
- Oh, you know who I am.
- Well, a man like yourself

13:09.016 --> 13:11.716
needs no introduction.
- That is very kind of you,

13:11.718 --> 13:13.418
but I'm not here for you
to blow smoke up my ass.

13:13.420 --> 13:15.520
Let me guess:
Alex realized

13:15.522 --> 13:16.955
he wasn't gonna stop me
on his own.

13:16.957 --> 13:18.523
He realized
that you were trying

13:18.525 --> 13:20.225
to undermine him, which is why
I'm here to tell you

13:20.227 --> 13:21.860
that you're gonna stop
pursuing Delta.

13:21.862 --> 13:23.762
I don't believe this.

13:23.764 --> 13:25.263
Are you seriously
coming in here to tell me

13:25.265 --> 13:28.166
I can't sign one of the world's
biggest airlines?

13:28.168 --> 13:29.401
Yeah, I am.

13:29.403 --> 13:33.805
And this isn't a discussion;
it's an order.

13:33.807 --> 13:35.874
I hope you've had a chance

13:35.876 --> 13:37.409
to think long

13:37.411 --> 13:40.212
and hard about this.

13:40.214 --> 13:42.747
Because I'd be careful
what you wish for.

13:42.749 --> 13:44.716
You trying to intimidate me?

13:44.718 --> 13:46.551
Just giving you
a little advice.

13:46.553 --> 13:48.420
Well, listen here,
sweet face.

13:48.422 --> 13:50.055
I get it.

13:50.057 --> 13:51.156
You're the it girl.

13:51.158 --> 13:53.291
Well, you know who I am?

13:53.293 --> 13:54.659
I'm Litt man.

13:54.661 --> 13:57.462
And you can try to sashay
your six-foot frame around here

13:57.464 --> 14:00.732
like you're Brigitte Nielsen
in 1985--

14:00.734 --> 14:03.568
turn me into a puddle,
get me to capitulate.

14:03.570 --> 14:07.405
Well, I got news for you:
it's not gonna happen.

14:07.407 --> 14:09.741
All right.

14:09.743 --> 14:11.843
I'll drop Delta.

14:11.845 --> 14:13.278
I knew you'd see things
my way.

14:13.280 --> 14:16.481
But someday...

14:16.483 --> 14:19.751
you're gonna come asking
for a favor.

14:19.753 --> 14:24.389
Might not be today,
might not be tomorrow,

14:24.391 --> 14:26.892
but it's gonna happen...

14:26.894 --> 14:29.261
and when it does...

14:29.263 --> 14:32.531
I'm gonna remember
this conversation.

14:32.533 --> 14:35.066
And Louis?

14:35.068 --> 14:37.302
If you think I couldn't
turn you into a puddle,

14:37.304 --> 14:41.006
you are wildly mistaken.

14:41.008 --> 14:42.574
So we're clear.
You'll drop the client.

14:42.576 --> 14:45.944
I have to go somewhere now.
- Mm.

14:45.946 --> 14:48.780
I'm sure you do.

14:55.270 --> 14:56.770
Brian.

14:56.772 --> 14:58.738
What's going on?
You look lost.

14:58.740 --> 15:00.067
I'm not lost.
I'm just under the gun.

15:00.068 --> 15:01.679
Have you seen Katrina?
- No, why?

15:01.680 --> 15:03.213
Bigelow Textiles
is in the conference room

15:03.215 --> 15:06.016
and the meeting was scheduled
for five minutes ago.

15:06.018 --> 15:07.551
I don't know what to do.
- Easy.

15:07.553 --> 15:09.753
Katrina's never missed
a meeting in her life.

15:09.755 --> 15:10.954
If she's not there,
she will be.

15:10.956 --> 15:11.755
Just go ahead and start.
- Thing is, I just got

15:11.757 --> 15:12.756
the case an hour ago.

15:12.758 --> 15:15.759
I'm hazy on the particulars
at best.

15:15.761 --> 15:17.327
I think I should cancel.
- I don't think

15:17.329 --> 15:18.629
that's a good idea.
- But what happens

15:18.631 --> 15:20.511
if I start the meeting
and she doesn't show up at all?

15:20.535 --> 15:22.152
And what happens
when you cancel the meeting

15:22.153 --> 15:23.359
and she shows up
three minutes later?

15:23.360 --> 15:24.930
- Donna--
- Brian, look.

15:26.044 --> 15:28.111
I know your value,
and I believe

15:28.113 --> 15:30.246
that Katrina knows your value,
but the truth is,

15:30.248 --> 15:32.282
not too long ago,
you were on the chopping block.

15:32.284 --> 15:34.417
If you've been invited in
on this case,

15:34.419 --> 15:35.785
you're being offered
another chance.

15:35.787 --> 15:37.420
And canceling a meeting
that Katrina's running

15:37.422 --> 15:39.956
a little late to isn't the way
to prove myself.

15:39.958 --> 15:42.125
No, it's not.

15:43.895 --> 15:45.728
You're right.

15:45.730 --> 15:48.264
I'll get it going.

15:51.403 --> 15:52.669
Harvey.

15:52.671 --> 15:54.916
Is there a reason
why the 49th floor toilets

15:54.917 --> 15:56.839
have been backed up?
- Why would I know that?

15:56.840 --> 15:58.772
Because when I called
to have it fixed, they said

15:58.773 --> 16:00.292
they couldn't get to it
for another four hours

16:00.293 --> 16:02.274
and in the mean time,
maybe you could

16:02.275 --> 16:04.008
take a look at it.

16:04.010 --> 16:05.439
Son of a bitch.

16:07.213 --> 16:09.647
You, you, you.

16:09.649 --> 16:11.115
Drop what you're doing
and meet me

16:11.117 --> 16:12.416
in the conference room.
- We're working on something...

16:12.418 --> 16:13.417
I don't give a shit
what you're working on.

16:13.419 --> 16:18.088
Conference room, five minutes.

16:18.090 --> 16:19.723
Harvey.

16:19.725 --> 16:20.925
Donna, I'm in the middle
of something.

16:20.927 --> 16:22.893
I can see that.
Do you mind telling me

16:22.894 --> 16:25.193
what that something has to do
with those toilets?

16:25.194 --> 16:29.096
It has to do with the fact
that David Fox wants a fight

16:29.098 --> 16:30.897
and I'm gonna give him one.
- A fight about what?

16:30.899 --> 16:32.937
He doesn't want to pay
our cleaning woman overtime.

16:32.938 --> 16:35.505
Hang on, so you're pulling
the associates

16:35.507 --> 16:36.840
off the Vistech merger
to help her?

16:36.842 --> 16:38.141
Fine, you want me to use
different associates?

16:38.143 --> 16:39.442
I will.
- I don't care

16:39.444 --> 16:42.145
what associates you're using;
I want to explain to you

16:42.147 --> 16:43.480
that David Fox is no joke.

16:43.482 --> 16:45.682
And as noble as it sounds,
you don't want

16:45.684 --> 16:47.918
to get in a fight with him
over something like this.

16:47.920 --> 16:50.353
I know that, Donna.
That's what I said to Zane.

16:50.355 --> 16:52.856
- But...
- But what?

16:52.858 --> 16:55.625
Harvey, this isn't what we do.
- Mike would have done it.

16:55.627 --> 16:57.494
And Mike's not here anymore
because he finally came

16:57.496 --> 17:00.830
came to terms with the fact
that this isn't what we do.

17:00.832 --> 17:03.767
Look, if you told Zane
you knew this wasn't worth it,

17:03.769 --> 17:06.435
then you already know
I'm right.

17:08.205 --> 17:09.606
Okay, Donna.
You're right.

17:09.608 --> 17:11.875
Tell those associates
to get back to whatever

17:11.877 --> 17:14.444
they were working on.

17:19.718 --> 17:22.786
Mr. Bigelow, nice to meet you.

17:22.788 --> 17:24.020
I'm sorry we're running
a little late.

17:24.021 --> 17:25.555
I'm Brian Altman.
- Where the hell's Katrina?

17:25.557 --> 17:26.890
I'm sure
she'll be right here.

17:26.892 --> 17:28.023
In the mean time,
can I offer you--

17:28.026 --> 17:30.493
No, no, no.
I don't have time

17:30.495 --> 17:32.095
for the meantime.

17:32.097 --> 17:33.196
If Ms. Bennett can't bother
showing up on time,

17:33.198 --> 17:35.532
she can play catch-up
when she gets here.

17:35.534 --> 17:37.000
Okay, I see you're
in a hurry.

17:37.002 --> 17:38.335
Let's go through the report
from the top.

17:38.337 --> 17:41.404
I don't need you
to read me the damn report.

17:41.406 --> 17:45.075
What I need are some answers.

17:45.077 --> 17:47.577
Um, all right.
What do you want to know?

17:47.579 --> 17:49.079
What kind of exposure
are we looking at, here?

17:49.081 --> 17:51.581
Well, Kineserve claims
you improperly broke

17:51.583 --> 17:53.883
your contract,
but the board minutes

17:53.885 --> 17:55.352
don't indicate any bad faith
on your part.

17:55.354 --> 17:58.054
That's the good news.
- And the bad news?

17:58.056 --> 18:00.457
The minutes don't show
any discussion of good cause

18:00.459 --> 18:02.292
for terminating
the contract, either.

18:02.294 --> 18:03.326
No good cause?

18:03.328 --> 18:06.629
Did you see
the delivery manifests?

18:06.631 --> 18:08.098
Um, I'd have to take
another look at them

18:08.100 --> 18:09.566
before weighing in.
- Another look?

18:09.568 --> 18:14.237
What about
the stress test results?

18:14.239 --> 18:15.538
Right.

18:15.540 --> 18:16.940
Let me just find that.
- You haven't even read

18:16.942 --> 18:18.308
all the goddamn minutes,
have you?

18:18.310 --> 18:21.411
I must have
just missed that part.

18:21.413 --> 18:22.379
If you'd just let me find it...

18:22.381 --> 18:23.613
I can see
what's going on, here.

18:23.615 --> 18:25.181
Katrina didn't think
I was worthy of her attention,

18:25.183 --> 18:26.683
so she pawned me off
on some incompetent,

18:26.685 --> 18:30.620
second-rate associate.
- Mr. Bigelow, I can assure you

18:30.622 --> 18:31.788
that is not the case.

18:31.790 --> 18:33.990
Katrina values your business
very much,

18:33.992 --> 18:35.658
and I am
a fully capable attorney.

18:35.660 --> 18:37.127
Not from what I see.

18:37.129 --> 18:38.795
And if I can't be handled
by a competent attorney,

18:38.797 --> 18:41.464
I don't see why I should
be handled by this firm at all.

18:41.466 --> 18:43.433
Please, Mr. Bigelow.

18:43.435 --> 18:44.968
Um, if we could just reset,
I think we got off

18:44.970 --> 18:46.302
on the wrong foot.
- You wanna reset?

18:46.304 --> 18:48.938
Get your shit together,
'cause I'm not about

18:48.940 --> 18:50.140
to sit here and watch you
bumble your way

18:50.142 --> 18:51.508
through something you're
clearly not prepared for.

18:51.510 --> 18:52.675
And the next time
you call me in for a meeting

18:52.677 --> 18:55.211
without Katrina Bennett,
don't bother

18:55.213 --> 18:57.213
calling me in at all.

18:59.000 --> 19:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

19:07.076 --> 19:08.576
I don't believe this.

19:08.944 --> 19:10.177
- Brian...
- No, you sent me in

19:10.179 --> 19:12.780
to a meeting by myself,
and you're, what?

19:12.782 --> 19:14.448
Out taking a stroll
around the park?

19:14.450 --> 19:16.150
- Please, not now.
- Yes, now, because I just got

19:16.152 --> 19:18.018
my ass handed to me
by your client.

19:18.020 --> 19:19.753
I wasn't taking a stroll;
I was in the bathroom

19:19.755 --> 19:21.522
in a stall
because it's the only place

19:21.524 --> 19:25.092
in this entire building
that's dark and quiet.

19:25.094 --> 19:27.027
- What are you talking about?
- I had a migraine.

19:27.029 --> 19:28.796
One of the worst I've ever had.

19:28.798 --> 19:30.431
And when it was time
for the meeting

19:30.433 --> 19:31.565
I opened the door,
but even with the sunglasses

19:31.567 --> 19:33.934
the light made it feel
like there were icicles

19:33.936 --> 19:36.937
in my head,
and I couldn't leave.

19:36.939 --> 19:39.673
Brian, I'm so sorry.

19:39.675 --> 19:41.442
I had no idea
you get migraines.

19:41.444 --> 19:43.544
I haven't had one
since high school.

19:43.546 --> 19:46.213
They're triggered by stress.
- You mean like the stress

19:46.215 --> 19:47.781
of having to fire
a bunch of associates.

19:47.783 --> 19:50.617
They started the day after.

19:50.619 --> 19:52.252
- You need to tell Louis.
- No.

19:52.254 --> 19:53.687
Louis is the last person
who can know about this.

19:53.689 --> 19:55.389
Why would you want
to hide this from him?

19:55.391 --> 19:57.024
Because you don't get
nine shots at senior partner;

19:57.026 --> 19:59.059
you get one.

19:59.061 --> 20:01.662
You're up
for senior partner.

20:01.664 --> 20:03.197
I am.

20:03.199 --> 20:05.766
No one is supposed to know
about this, not even me.

20:05.768 --> 20:07.701
And if suddenly I start
getting migraines

20:07.703 --> 20:10.003
that make it seem
like I can't handle the job...

20:10.005 --> 20:13.373
No one's gonna find out
anything from me.

20:13.375 --> 20:15.809
But Bigelow is pretty pissed.
- Well, Bigelow isn't going

20:15.811 --> 20:17.344
to be at the motion
to dismiss tomorrow,

20:17.346 --> 20:20.714
so as long as I win that,
we'll be fine.

20:20.716 --> 20:23.584
In the meantime, I'd better
go face the music with Louis.

20:23.586 --> 20:24.985
Brian, you don't have
to do that.

20:24.987 --> 20:26.320
If I don't,
he's gonna find out

20:26.322 --> 20:28.689
about your migraines.

20:28.691 --> 20:30.524
Be direct.

20:30.526 --> 20:32.092
Tell him you're sorry.

20:32.094 --> 20:37.097
He might not be happy,
but he'll respect you.

20:37.099 --> 20:38.499
Brian.

20:38.501 --> 20:40.000
If ever there were any doubt

20:40.002 --> 20:42.503
about you being
a valuable associate...

20:42.505 --> 20:44.338
there isn't anymore.

20:45.841 --> 20:49.009
- Anna, it's Harvey Specter.
<i>- Mr. Specter.</i>

20:49.011 --> 20:50.744
<i>I didn't expect</i>
<i>to hear from you so soon.</i>

20:50.746 --> 20:51.845
<i>Does this mean that--</i>
- I'm afraid

20:51.847 --> 20:54.948
it's not gonna work.
- What?

20:54.950 --> 20:57.918
<i>I tried talking to them,</i>
<i>and there's nothing I can do.</i>

20:57.920 --> 20:59.419
You mean you don't want
to make a problem

20:59.421 --> 21:01.522
for your firm.
<i>- No.</i>

21:01.524 --> 21:03.323
Anna...

21:03.325 --> 21:05.259
there's another firm out there
I can recommend to you.

21:05.261 --> 21:07.761
I can't afford
to pay another firm.

21:07.763 --> 21:09.029
<i>You wouldn't have to.</i>

21:09.031 --> 21:11.598
Look, the guy who used
to do cases like this

21:11.600 --> 21:13.667
doesn't work here anymore,
but he used to work

21:13.669 --> 21:15.869
at a clinic, and I'm talking
about setting you up there.

21:15.871 --> 21:17.204
<i>I should have known</i>

21:17.206 --> 21:19.640
<i>you'd pawn me off.</i>
- I'm not pawning you off.

21:19.642 --> 21:22.342
I promise, I will go down there
and make sure one

21:22.344 --> 21:26.146
of the two lawyers I know
handles this personally.

21:26.148 --> 21:27.581
Okay.

21:27.583 --> 21:30.951
If you trust this firm,
then I trust you.

21:30.953 --> 21:33.287
I'll be in touch.

21:37.459 --> 21:41.128
Yes, absolutely.

21:41.130 --> 21:43.864
I agree 100%.

21:45.634 --> 21:49.236
Never again.

21:49.238 --> 21:50.437
Hey, Louis, can I talk
to you for a second?

21:50.439 --> 21:51.538
Sure as hell can,
'cause I wanna know

21:51.540 --> 21:53.841
what the ---- happened
in that meeting.

21:53.843 --> 21:55.075
- That's what I came--
- You know what, never mind.

21:55.077 --> 21:56.143
I don't need to hear it,
because I just got

21:56.145 --> 21:58.245
off the phone
with John Bigelow,

21:58.247 --> 21:59.580
and he tells me
that you couldn't answer

21:59.582 --> 22:02.049
a goddamn question.
- I know that, and I just--

22:02.051 --> 22:03.884
He also says, and I quote,
"I never want

22:03.886 --> 22:08.021
to be in another meeting
with Brian Altman again."

22:08.023 --> 22:09.656
I--I'm sorry, Louis.
I'm sorry.

22:09.658 --> 22:10.791
You're sorry?

22:10.793 --> 22:11.992
That's all you have
to say for yourself?

22:11.994 --> 22:14.494
Because you just
let down Katrina.

22:14.496 --> 22:16.363
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

22:16.365 --> 22:18.866
- I do.
- I do not think that you do.

22:18.868 --> 22:21.835
Because she wanted to fire you,
Brian, and I wouldn't let her.

22:21.837 --> 22:23.270
Then she gives you
a second chance,

22:23.272 --> 22:24.905
and you do this?

22:24.907 --> 22:27.541
What the hell is your excuse,
Brian?

22:27.543 --> 22:30.010
Do you just suck at your job,
or are you actively trying

22:30.012 --> 22:32.713
to undermine
a direct supervisor?

22:32.715 --> 22:34.915
- I guess I suck at my job.
- Something like this

22:34.917 --> 22:37.017
ever happens again,
forget about being fired.

22:37.019 --> 22:38.585
You're gonna wish
you were never born.

22:38.587 --> 22:41.788
Now get out, because right now
John Bigelow isn't the only one

22:41.790 --> 22:44.858
who never wants
to see your face again.

23:01.543 --> 23:04.945
Hi, can I help you?

23:04.947 --> 23:06.213
Is Nathan Krueger here?

23:06.215 --> 23:09.016
Nathan's in Philadelphia
on a case.

23:09.018 --> 23:11.752
- How about Oliver Grady?
- Oliver's out with a client.

23:11.754 --> 23:13.720
Is there something
I can help you with?

23:13.722 --> 23:15.389
No, thanks.

23:15.391 --> 23:17.724
Can I tell them
who stopped by?

23:17.726 --> 23:20.661
It's okay; I've taken enough
of your time.

23:27.069 --> 23:29.169
- Is that what I think it is?
- Renoir.

23:29.171 --> 23:31.438
Signed, sealed, and delivered.

23:31.440 --> 23:32.606
Mind telling me
how you pulled it off?

23:32.608 --> 23:34.741
Absolutely, as soon
as you hand me

23:34.743 --> 23:36.343
a signed engagement letter.

23:36.345 --> 23:37.544
You know what,
I'm gonna do you one better.

23:37.546 --> 23:39.112
Why don't you take out
your phone and check out

23:39.114 --> 23:40.514
the latest edition
of the "Journal."

23:44.320 --> 23:46.320
I don't believe it.

23:46.322 --> 23:47.321
You issued an announcement

23:47.323 --> 23:48.989
saying we're
your new attorneys.

23:48.991 --> 23:50.290
I told you, you're my guy,
and I don't mind

23:50.292 --> 23:52.526
the world knowing it.

23:52.528 --> 23:55.762
- So where do you want this?
- I don't give a shit,

23:55.764 --> 23:57.798
'cause it's not
gonna be here long.

23:57.800 --> 23:59.666
What?

23:59.668 --> 24:00.734
I'm shipping it
to the Cayman Islands

24:00.736 --> 24:01.868
where a certain
airline company's

24:01.870 --> 24:05.372
gonna pay me $55 million
for it.

24:05.374 --> 24:06.940
I thought you said
it was only worth 16,

24:06.942 --> 24:08.041
and that you'd never sell it.

24:08.043 --> 24:10.043
Well, that's the thing
about art:

24:10.045 --> 24:12.846
the value is in the eye
of the beholder.

24:12.848 --> 24:15.916
I want you to behold this.

24:18.153 --> 24:20.620
You want me on-shore
55 million from a blind trust

24:20.622 --> 24:21.922
in the Caymans?

24:21.924 --> 24:23.991
Gavin, I have to tell you,
this looks a hell of lot

24:23.993 --> 24:25.492
like laundering money.
- Well, then it's a good thing

24:25.494 --> 24:27.561
you don't know that for sure,
because if you don't know it

24:27.563 --> 24:30.464
you can do it,
and you're going to do it.

24:30.466 --> 24:31.698
I get it.

24:31.700 --> 24:33.800
You gave me a bullshit story
about this thing

24:33.802 --> 24:35.502
having sentimental value
to rope me in.

24:35.504 --> 24:37.037
then you put out
an announcement saying

24:37.039 --> 24:37.938
we're your attorneys.

24:37.940 --> 24:40.674
And now, if I don't do this,

24:40.676 --> 24:41.708
you drop us
and the world thinks

24:41.710 --> 24:43.643
we shit the bed
inside of a day.

24:43.645 --> 24:45.345
You catch on quick.

24:45.347 --> 24:47.381
- I'm not doing it.
- Maybe you will,

24:47.383 --> 24:49.383
maybe you won't.

24:49.385 --> 24:50.717
But you'd better think about
how you're gonna explain

24:50.719 --> 24:53.353
to Robert Zane
how you signed me and lost me

24:53.355 --> 24:55.922
inside of two days.

25:06.638 --> 25:08.420
There you are.
I've been waiting for you

25:08.421 --> 25:09.887
to give me something to do.

25:09.889 --> 25:12.122
There isn't much left to do,
so I'm handling it myself.

25:12.124 --> 25:15.292
Katrina, come on,
there's a ton of work left.

25:16.128 --> 25:17.294
I can see you're still in pain.

25:17.296 --> 25:18.095
There must be something
I can do.

25:18.097 --> 25:19.363
I'll be fine.

25:19.365 --> 25:21.665
What if I turned
all the lights on?

25:21.667 --> 25:23.700
Would you be fine then?

25:23.702 --> 25:25.202
Katrina, 'cause that's
what it's gonna be like

25:25.204 --> 25:28.205
in court tomorrow.
- Brian.

25:28.207 --> 25:30.607
I heard what happened
with Louis,

25:30.609 --> 25:33.677
and I'm not going
to let that happen again.

25:37.650 --> 25:40.417
Listen to me.

25:40.419 --> 25:42.319
I knew what I signed up for
when I said I'd keep

25:42.321 --> 25:45.489
your situation a secret.
- And I appreciate it.

25:45.491 --> 25:47.224
And now I'm going
to go into court tomorrow

25:47.226 --> 25:48.325
and do the best I can.

25:48.327 --> 25:50.127
Katrina, you gave me
a second chance,

25:50.129 --> 25:53.097
and when you did,
you admitted you were wrong.

25:54.500 --> 25:56.266
Not everyone would do that.

25:56.268 --> 25:58.569
And someone that would
is exactly the kind of person

25:58.571 --> 26:01.238
I want to have leading me
as a senior partner.

26:01.240 --> 26:03.273
So if you won't let me
do this for you,

26:03.275 --> 26:05.409
at least let's do it together.

26:07.813 --> 26:09.947
Okay, Brian.
We'll do it together.

26:12.418 --> 26:14.418
Alex, whatever it is,
I'm meeting a client

26:14.420 --> 26:15.452
for dinner.
- That's okay,

26:15.454 --> 26:16.687
I just have one question.

26:16.689 --> 26:17.921
Did you know?
- Know what?

26:17.923 --> 26:19.323
That Gavin Andrews
was gonna ask me

26:19.325 --> 26:21.992
to launder money for him.

26:21.994 --> 26:24.294
I don't believe it.
You knew it the whole time.

26:24.296 --> 26:25.863
No, I didn't.

26:25.865 --> 26:27.698
But I knew he was gonna
ask you to do something.

26:27.700 --> 26:29.433
Then you and I
are gonna go upstairs

26:29.435 --> 26:30.834
and figure out how
to get out of this, right now.

26:30.836 --> 26:32.503
Are you out of your mind?

26:32.505 --> 26:34.138
I'm not going anywhere near
that man's account.

26:34.140 --> 26:36.273
Yes, you are,
because you knew my history

26:36.275 --> 26:38.075
and you let me
sign him anyway.

26:38.077 --> 26:40.144
Are you fucking kidding me?
I brought up your history.

26:40.146 --> 26:42.112
And you knew I was
in no position to trust you.

26:42.114 --> 26:43.313
And what I was I supposed
to do about that?

26:43.315 --> 26:45.682
You could have given me
some goddamn specifics.

26:45.684 --> 26:47.351
'Cause there's no way
you didn't have something

26:47.353 --> 26:48.986
that would have convinced me
you were telling the truth.

26:48.988 --> 26:50.687
And how was I supposed
to trust you wouldn't use

26:50.689 --> 26:52.356
whatever I said against me?
- I wouldn't do that.

26:52.358 --> 26:53.724
Oh?
So if I had said,

26:53.726 --> 26:55.359
"Hey, Alex,
don't sign this guy.

26:55.361 --> 26:56.360
He's gonna ask you
to cover up a murder."

26:56.362 --> 26:57.327
You weren't gonna use that?

26:57.329 --> 26:59.062
Is that what he asked you
to do?

26:59.064 --> 27:00.631
This conversation is over.

27:00.633 --> 27:02.533
You made your bed.
Don't come crying to me

27:02.535 --> 27:05.068
because the sheets are dirty.
- I'm not gonna cry to anyone.

27:05.070 --> 27:06.870
I'm gonna tell Zane
exactly what this man

27:06.872 --> 27:08.472
is all about,
and we'll see what happens

27:08.474 --> 27:10.307
when he finds out
whatever shit you did.

27:10.309 --> 27:14.178
You don't think Robert knew?

27:14.180 --> 27:15.512
Why do you think
he didn't fight

27:15.514 --> 27:18.849
for Gavin's business
when we left Rand Kaldor?

27:18.851 --> 27:21.318
You're saying Zane knows
you did illegal shit?

27:21.320 --> 27:24.254
I'm saying, Robert Zane knew
what kind of a client

27:24.256 --> 27:26.990
Gavin Andrews was,
that I knew how to handle him,

27:26.992 --> 27:29.693
and that I stopped wanting to.

27:29.695 --> 27:32.896
Then help me get out of this.

27:32.898 --> 27:34.565
- Why should I?
- Because we're on

27:34.567 --> 27:36.567
the same team,
and that's supposed

27:36.569 --> 27:38.502
to mean something,
especially when it's about

27:38.504 --> 27:40.037
breaking the law.

27:40.039 --> 27:41.672
Please, Samantha.

27:41.674 --> 27:44.608
I should have listened to you,
but I have a family.

27:44.610 --> 27:47.911
I can't afford to do something
that'll hurt them.

27:47.913 --> 27:51.215
Okay, Alex.

27:53.018 --> 27:54.184
You are a family man.

27:54.186 --> 27:57.421
He is not.
- What are you saying?

27:57.423 --> 27:59.856
I'm saying,
you're the kind of man

27:59.858 --> 28:02.859
that would go to any length
to protect your family.

28:02.861 --> 28:04.695
Gavin Andrews
is the kind of man

28:04.697 --> 28:09.366
that would go to any length
to protect himself.

28:12.338 --> 28:15.105
So all we need to do
is open with material breach,

28:15.107 --> 28:17.407
show severability
doesn't apply, then close

28:17.409 --> 28:19.409
with impossibility
of performance.

28:19.411 --> 28:20.911
We do all that,
it'll drive the stake

28:20.913 --> 28:23.313
right through their claim.

28:23.315 --> 28:25.582
We?

28:25.584 --> 28:27.284
Yes, we.

28:27.286 --> 28:28.819
Because although
I'm feeling better,

28:28.821 --> 28:30.053
you did this as much as I did,
which means

28:30.055 --> 28:32.489
we should do it together.

28:32.491 --> 28:34.491
You sure?

28:34.493 --> 28:36.593
I'm sure.

28:36.595 --> 28:37.661
I do believe
that's the first time

28:37.663 --> 28:38.829
I've seen you smile
since we started

28:38.831 --> 28:41.431
this whole thing.

28:41.433 --> 28:43.166
I was just thinking
about my senior year

28:43.168 --> 28:44.301
of high school.

28:44.303 --> 28:45.502
This is how I used
to do my homework.

28:45.504 --> 28:47.504
You had an associate
write your papers for you

28:47.506 --> 28:50.941
in high school?
- I had a study partner.

28:50.943 --> 28:53.343
He was my best friend.

28:53.345 --> 28:56.113
We used to write our papers
together by flash light.

28:56.115 --> 28:59.583
Never thought I'd be doing
the same thing years later.

28:59.585 --> 29:02.152
You in touch with him?

29:02.154 --> 29:03.954
No.

29:03.956 --> 29:05.656
But I feel like I am
after tonight.

29:08.594 --> 29:10.961
Now you're smiling.
I know it sounds cheesy.

29:10.963 --> 29:13.330
No, I was just thinking
about where we were a week ago

29:13.332 --> 29:16.800
when I thought
you were cold and heartless.

29:16.802 --> 29:19.202
And I went from that
to being your best friend

29:19.204 --> 29:21.038
in record time.
- I wouldn't say best friends.

29:21.040 --> 29:22.739
Well, you can only say stuff
like that to me

29:22.741 --> 29:24.941
because we're, like,
best friends.

29:24.943 --> 29:27.344
Well, I don't know
about that.

29:27.346 --> 29:29.513
But we are close enough
for me to tell you

29:29.515 --> 29:30.981
that you're going
to go to court

29:30.983 --> 29:32.516
by yourself tomorrow.

29:32.518 --> 29:34.685
But I thought you said
you were feeling better.

29:34.687 --> 29:37.554
I am, but you did all this
to help prove

29:37.556 --> 29:38.889
that I could manage people,

29:38.891 --> 29:40.157
and what kind of manager
would I be

29:40.159 --> 29:41.795
if I didn't give you a chance
to prove yourself

29:41.796 --> 29:44.261
to John Bigelow?

29:44.263 --> 29:46.496
You sure?

29:46.498 --> 29:49.466
I'm sure.

29:55.741 --> 29:57.307
What do you mean
you gotta go down to Central?

29:57.309 --> 29:58.709
How long's that gonna take?
- It's gonna take

29:58.711 --> 29:59.876
as long as it takes.
- What the hell

29:59.878 --> 30:01.211
is going on, here?
- Robert, you all right?

30:01.213 --> 30:02.446
You look like hell.
- The elevator wouldn't stop

30:02.448 --> 30:03.814
on our floor.

30:03.816 --> 30:06.416
Had to get off at 45 and hike
the rest of the way up here.

30:06.418 --> 30:08.218
God damn, man,
you gotta keep in shape.

30:08.220 --> 30:09.653
That was only five floors.
- Is that really the problem

30:09.655 --> 30:11.054
we need to talk about, Louis?
- No.

30:11.056 --> 30:12.389
In fact, an hour ago,
the elevators

30:12.391 --> 30:13.957
weren't working at all.
- Shit.

30:13.959 --> 30:15.225
And now this ass clown says
that he needs

30:15.227 --> 30:17.394
to have landlord's approval
to order a simple fuse.

30:17.396 --> 30:18.929
- What?
- I said that he's--

30:18.931 --> 30:20.764
I know what you said.
I wanna hear it from him.

30:20.766 --> 30:22.099
What do you want me to say?

30:22.101 --> 30:23.767
I got orders
from my supervisor.

30:23.769 --> 30:25.869
No new parts without Mr. Fox's
specific approval.

30:25.871 --> 30:27.371
Louis, I know
what's going on here.

30:27.373 --> 30:29.373
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about the fact

30:29.375 --> 30:31.942
that this is
no goddamn coincidence.

30:35.414 --> 30:36.580
Anna, it's Harvey Specter.

30:36.582 --> 30:37.948
I've got good news:
I've decided

30:37.950 --> 30:41.284
<i>to take care of you myself.</i>

30:41.286 --> 30:42.919
Because I showed up
to work this morning

30:42.921 --> 30:46.490
and they told me I was fired,
and that I shouldn't bother

30:46.492 --> 30:48.225
<i>applying to any...</i>
- Anna, I got something

30:48.227 --> 30:49.593
I can't reschedule
right this second.

30:49.595 --> 30:51.027
I'm gonna have to--
<i>- Please, Mr. Specter.</i>

30:51.029 --> 30:53.897
<i>I was in horrible shape</i>
<i>before, but now I don't know</i>

30:53.899 --> 30:55.165
<i>what to do.</i>
- Look, I'll tell you

30:55.167 --> 30:56.700
what we're gonna do:
I'm gonna call you back

30:56.702 --> 30:57.934
in five minutes, you're gonna
tell me exactly what happened.

30:57.936 --> 31:01.505
because I'm not gonna let them
get away with this.

31:01.507 --> 31:02.739
Okay, Harvey,
what the hell is going on

31:02.741 --> 31:04.174
with that cleaning woman?
- Robert...

31:04.176 --> 31:05.342
You said you weren't going
to pick a fight, and you did.

31:05.344 --> 31:07.978
And now our elevators
aren't working.

31:07.980 --> 31:09.346
You wanna know
what's going on?

31:09.348 --> 31:12.649
David Fox just retaliated
against Anna by firing her,

31:12.651 --> 31:14.684
and I'm about
to knock his teeth out.

31:14.686 --> 31:16.820
- You will do no such thing.
- Relax, Robert.

31:16.822 --> 31:18.522
We can handle
a clogged toilet or two.

31:18.524 --> 31:20.123
Did you hear
what I just said?

31:20.125 --> 31:21.091
I'm not talking about toilets.

31:21.093 --> 31:23.026
The man just shut down
our elevators,

31:23.028 --> 31:24.594
and I'm not gonna let us
start losing clients

31:24.596 --> 31:26.163
because you decided
the cleaning staff

31:26.165 --> 31:27.531
is more important
than the needs of this firm.

31:27.533 --> 31:29.966
I didn't do anything
that you didn't sign off on.

31:29.968 --> 31:31.501
Bullshit.
You said that you were

31:31.503 --> 31:32.636
gonna have
a two-minute conversation

31:32.638 --> 31:34.271
with the man,
and if that's all you did

31:34.273 --> 31:35.672
he wouldn't be sabotaging
our offices.

31:35.674 --> 31:37.274
Well, you know what, Robert?
I don't care

31:37.276 --> 31:39.810
what he's doing to us.
I care what he's doing to her.

31:39.812 --> 31:41.611
- What did you just say?
- I said I don't care

31:41.613 --> 31:42.846
what he's doing to us.
- Well, I do.

31:42.848 --> 31:45.148
- Excuse me?
- You heard me, Harvey.

31:45.150 --> 31:46.450
I don't know what it is
you think you're doing,

31:46.452 --> 31:48.618
but it needs to stop.
- I don't believe this.

31:48.620 --> 31:50.520
You're siding with him.
- Yes, Harvey, I am.

31:50.522 --> 31:51.955
And you're not gonna want
to hear this either, Harvey,

31:51.957 --> 31:53.023
but I am too.

31:53.025 --> 31:54.324
Because if you keep
escalating this,

31:54.326 --> 31:55.759
it's not just gonna be
about broken elevators.

31:55.761 --> 31:56.960
He's gonna find a way
to kick us out of the building.

31:56.962 --> 31:58.295
Well, none of you
are gonna want to hear this,

31:58.297 --> 32:01.965
but I don't give a shit
whether he kicks us out

32:01.967 --> 32:03.033
of the building or not.
- That's enough.

32:03.035 --> 32:04.267
You don't go to war
with the guy

32:04.269 --> 32:06.636
that owns your house
over something like this.

32:06.638 --> 32:10.207
End it, and end it today.

32:19.047 --> 32:20.579
May I join you?

32:20.884 --> 32:22.641
You don't usually ask that.

32:22.642 --> 32:23.875
And you haven't made
your own copies

32:23.877 --> 32:26.277
since we were at
the DA's office.

32:26.279 --> 32:27.912
I guess I haven't.

32:31.484 --> 32:32.984
Harvey, I thought
that you were gonna

32:32.986 --> 32:34.786
take this thing to the clinic.

32:34.788 --> 32:36.654
That's what I did, Donna.

32:36.656 --> 32:38.856
But Nathan and Oliver
weren't there;

32:38.858 --> 32:40.725
there were cases piled high
on every desk;

32:40.727 --> 32:42.560
and nobody there
would care about her

32:42.562 --> 32:44.529
the way I needed them to, so...

32:44.531 --> 32:46.731
I turned around
and I walked right out.

32:46.733 --> 32:49.701
- I see.
- How did I get here, Donna?

32:49.703 --> 32:52.537
I'm at odds with Robert
and Louis, and now even you,

32:52.539 --> 32:55.406
over something two months ago
shouldn't have even shown up

32:55.408 --> 32:56.407
on my radar.

32:56.409 --> 32:59.043
I'll tell you
how you got here...

32:59.045 --> 33:00.144
and I can't believe
I didn't see this

33:00.146 --> 33:02.480
the second you started
this thing.

33:02.482 --> 33:05.049
Harvey, you're missing Mike.

33:05.051 --> 33:06.584
- What are you talking about?
- Don't you see?

33:06.586 --> 33:08.920
This case has Mike Ross
written all over it.

33:08.922 --> 33:09.987
And you didn't walk out
of that clinic

33:09.989 --> 33:11.122
because Nathan and Oliver
weren't there;

33:11.124 --> 33:12.423
you walked out
because Mike wasn't there.

33:12.425 --> 33:15.093
Well, what am I supposed
to do about that, Donna?

33:15.095 --> 33:17.662
Because this woman needs help,
and I am not gonna throw her

33:17.664 --> 33:20.264
out on the street.
- Tell you what I'd do.

33:20.266 --> 33:21.466
I'd call Mike.

33:21.468 --> 33:23.234
If there's anyone who's been
in a situation

33:23.236 --> 33:24.602
like this before, it's him,

33:24.604 --> 33:27.572
and he's the best person
to figure a way out.

33:27.574 --> 33:29.340
But Harvey, you've got
to do it soon,

33:29.342 --> 33:31.743
because Robert and Louis
are right.

33:31.745 --> 33:35.413
You have to let this thing go.

33:43.123 --> 33:45.022
- Is it done?
- It is done.

33:45.024 --> 33:46.190
Good.

33:46.192 --> 33:50.762
Wasn't so hard, was it?
- Not for me.

33:50.764 --> 33:52.430
What's this?

33:52.432 --> 33:53.798
The hell did you do
with my money?

33:53.800 --> 33:56.200
I found you a legitimate
business opportunity.

33:56.202 --> 33:57.335
In the goddamn
Cayman Islands?

33:57.337 --> 33:58.703
Funny thing:
most people want

33:58.705 --> 34:01.439
to repatriate their money,
which means you can make

34:01.441 --> 34:03.708
a pretty sweet deal
by investing locally instead.

34:03.710 --> 34:06.110
You can't do this.
You don't have the authority.

34:06.112 --> 34:07.078
I do now,
because you're looking

34:07.080 --> 34:09.547
at the new trustee
of your account.

34:09.549 --> 34:11.616
- That's impossible.
- Is it?

34:11.618 --> 34:13.217
Pretty smart
making your niece trustee

34:13.219 --> 34:14.284
to insulate yourself.

34:14.286 --> 34:15.719
Of course, when I told her
you set her up

34:15.722 --> 34:16.987
to take the fall
if authorities ever found out

34:16.989 --> 34:18.356
where your money came from,
she was more than happy

34:18.358 --> 34:22.326
to sign over control to me.
- I don't believe you.

34:22.328 --> 34:24.228
Pick up the phone
and call her.

34:24.230 --> 34:25.362
She's kind of pissed
at you, though.

34:25.364 --> 34:27.598
Thanksgiving might be
weird this year.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.667
You son of a bitch.
You sold me out.

34:29.668 --> 34:31.636
No, Gavin, I didn't.

34:31.638 --> 34:33.771
I did what's in
your best interest,

34:33.773 --> 34:35.505
regardless of the fact
that you're too stupid

34:35.507 --> 34:36.741
to see it.

34:36.743 --> 34:39.143
- You're fired.
- I don't think so.

34:39.145 --> 34:40.378
Because if I can do this
to you,

34:40.380 --> 34:42.746
imagine what I can do
for you.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.449
But if you ever ask me
to do anything like this

34:45.451 --> 34:47.985
ever again,
I won't just turn you in.

34:47.987 --> 34:50.755
I'll sign over every nickel
of this trust to your niece,

34:50.757 --> 34:53.591
and every other relative
you've ever screwed over.

34:53.592 --> 34:56.527
Are we clear?

34:56.529 --> 34:59.430
We're clear.

35:08.141 --> 35:09.540
Louis, can I talk to you
for a minute?

35:09.542 --> 35:11.843
Of course.
But first, I understand

35:11.845 --> 35:13.177
congratulations are in order.

35:13.179 --> 35:14.946
I heard you won
in court today.

35:14.948 --> 35:16.180
That's the thing.

35:16.182 --> 35:19.617
It wasn't me who won, Louis;
it was Brian.

35:19.619 --> 35:21.219
- What?
- Just let me explain.

35:21.221 --> 35:22.653
Explain what?

35:22.655 --> 35:23.788
That the client said "no Brian"
and you didn't listen?

35:23.790 --> 35:25.022
I don't care
what the client said

35:25.024 --> 35:27.959
because two years ago,
another client said,

35:27.961 --> 35:29.093
"no Katrina" and "no Rachel,"

35:29.095 --> 35:31.462
and you told them
to go to hell.

35:31.464 --> 35:33.064
So why should I be
any different

35:33.066 --> 35:34.799
as a manager than you?
- Because, Katrina,

35:34.801 --> 35:36.500
the situation was different.

35:36.502 --> 35:39.237
You didn't shit the bed;
Brian did.

35:39.239 --> 35:42.306
No, Louis, he didn't.

35:42.308 --> 35:45.176
I did.

35:45.178 --> 35:46.377
What are you talking about?

35:46.379 --> 35:49.180
I've been getting migraines,
Louis.

35:49.182 --> 35:52.316
I used to get them as a kid,
and ever since I had

35:52.318 --> 35:55.987
to fire those associates,
I started getting them again.

35:55.989 --> 35:57.255
And you were afraid
to tell me

35:57.257 --> 35:59.257
because of senior partner.

35:59.259 --> 36:01.359
Yes, and I was supposed
to be in that meeting

36:01.361 --> 36:02.727
with Brian, and he didn't
tell you about it

36:02.729 --> 36:05.863
because he was protecting me.

36:07.367 --> 36:10.101
So it wasn't Brian's fault;
it was yours.

36:10.103 --> 36:12.403
It was.

36:12.405 --> 36:14.872
And I know you're gonna have
to tell Robert everything,

36:14.874 --> 36:19.176
and I know that probably means
I won't be senior partner,

36:19.178 --> 36:22.513
but I can't let Brian
hurt his career for me.

36:24.183 --> 36:26.851
Katrina, the only thing
I'm gonna be telling Robert

36:26.853 --> 36:30.554
is that you're gonna make
one hell of a senior partner.

36:40.233 --> 36:42.533
- Is that what I think it is?
- If you think it's the plan

36:42.535 --> 36:47.738
to put this Fox thing to bed,
then yes.

36:49.375 --> 36:51.242
This is good.

36:51.244 --> 36:53.144
Mike's a pretty smart guy.
- It is good,

36:53.146 --> 36:54.378
but Mike didn't
come up with it.

36:54.380 --> 36:55.646
- I did.
- Well,

36:55.648 --> 36:59.617
now that you mention it,
I do see a bunch of flaws.

36:59.619 --> 37:02.586
Seriously, Harvey,
this is great, but...

37:02.588 --> 37:04.922
why didn't you talk to Mike?

37:04.924 --> 37:07.124
Because I thought instead
of calling and asking

37:07.126 --> 37:10.294
for a solution, I'd rather call
and tell him a story

37:10.296 --> 37:12.330
with a happy ending.
- And you don't send in

37:12.332 --> 37:14.732
the puppy to clean up
the dog's mess.

37:14.734 --> 37:17.134
- Something like that.
- In that case,

37:17.136 --> 37:19.904
you're gonna need this back.
- No, I'm not,

37:19.906 --> 37:22.807
because you're gonna be the one
to give it to David Fox.

37:22.809 --> 37:25.209
- Why me?
- Because we still need

37:25.211 --> 37:27.578
to get him to agree,
and we can either do it

37:27.580 --> 37:30.081
with a sledgehammer
or a velvet glove.

37:30.083 --> 37:31.749
I get it.

37:31.751 --> 37:34.218
You're saying
I'm a sledgehammer.

37:34.220 --> 37:37.288
Something like that.

37:37.290 --> 37:39.657
Listen, Harvey, if you're
gonna send me in there

37:39.659 --> 37:40.891
to negotiate this,
I need to know

37:40.893 --> 37:43.094
that I have carte Blanche
to do what it takes

37:43.096 --> 37:46.397
to close him.
- I know.

37:46.399 --> 37:50.301
You do.

37:50.303 --> 37:51.902
Hey.

37:51.904 --> 37:54.305
How'd you think of this?

37:54.307 --> 37:55.439
Easy.

37:55.441 --> 37:59.310
I just thought,
"What would Mike do?"

38:07.020 --> 38:08.986
Donna Paulsen.

38:08.988 --> 38:10.855
- David Fox.
- You know, if you're here

38:10.857 --> 38:12.623
to harass me
about this cleaning lady,

38:12.625 --> 38:15.459
then you can just
turn right around.

38:15.461 --> 38:18.462
I'm here because of this.

38:22.535 --> 38:24.368
You're filing
a class-action lawsuit?

38:24.370 --> 38:26.537
We're not;
East Side Legal Clinic is.

38:26.539 --> 38:28.139
Which means that no matter
what you do to us,

38:28.141 --> 38:30.241
it's not going away.

38:30.243 --> 38:31.809
And if you try
to fire anybody else,

38:31.811 --> 38:33.277
you'll be getting
another one of those.

38:33.279 --> 38:35.980
And it won't be for overtime;
it'll be for retaliation.

38:35.982 --> 38:38.816
You'll be in court
for the rest of your life.

38:38.818 --> 38:41.385
Why are you here
instead of Harvey Specter?

38:41.387 --> 38:44.488
Because if Harvey were here,
he'd drop that down

38:44.490 --> 38:46.357
walk out,
and go to war with you.

38:46.359 --> 38:49.026
I, on the other hand,
have a compromise.

38:49.028 --> 38:51.829
- Which is?
- Give Anna Reed her job back,

38:51.831 --> 38:53.831
you start paying those people
what they're worth...

38:53.833 --> 38:55.866
- And?
- You get free legal services

38:55.868 --> 38:57.735
from Harvey Specter himself
for the next year.

38:57.737 --> 38:58.669
Oh, come on.
Bullshit.

38:58.671 --> 39:00.337
There's no way
he agrees to that.

39:00.339 --> 39:01.539
Oh, he'll agree to it,
all right.

39:01.541 --> 39:03.074
So you mean he doesn't
already know about it.

39:03.076 --> 39:04.408
No, he doesn't.

39:04.410 --> 39:06.544
But he gave me the authority
to close this thing,

39:06.546 --> 39:08.345
and that's what I've determined
it's gonna take

39:08.347 --> 39:10.414
because neither one of you
is gonna compromise

39:10.416 --> 39:13.717
unless you know the other one
is getting shafted.

39:13.719 --> 39:15.619
- One condition.
- Nope.

39:15.621 --> 39:17.388
This is take it or leave it.
- You won't even hear

39:17.390 --> 39:18.823
my condition.
- No, I won't,

39:18.825 --> 39:19.924
because I have no interest
in going to dinner with you

39:19.926 --> 39:21.592
to close this deal.

39:21.594 --> 39:23.561
So what's it gonna be?

39:23.563 --> 39:27.598
War or win-win?

39:27.600 --> 39:30.201
You set up the paperwork
in the morning, we got a deal.

39:30.203 --> 39:31.602
I'll do you one better.

39:31.604 --> 39:32.803
I'll send it down
in the morning.

39:32.805 --> 39:35.906
I got better things to do
with my time.

39:44.217 --> 39:45.549
What's this?

39:45.551 --> 39:49.053
Floor-level tickets
for the UFC at Barclays.

39:49.055 --> 39:51.822
- You did your homework.
- I did.

39:51.824 --> 39:52.990
Like you told me
I should have done

39:52.992 --> 39:54.125
with Gavin Andrews
in the first place.

39:54.127 --> 39:56.393
I assume that means
you took care of him?

39:56.395 --> 39:58.996
And the horse he rode in on.

39:58.998 --> 40:01.298
Anyway, I know
we'll probably end up

40:01.300 --> 40:02.600
going toe-to-toe
plenty of more times

40:02.602 --> 40:07.805
before it's all over,
but for now, good night.

40:07.807 --> 40:10.674
You're more than meets the eye.

40:10.676 --> 40:13.110
Alex.

40:13.112 --> 40:15.112
I know you think
we're in competition

40:15.114 --> 40:17.982
for the same thing,
but we're not.

40:17.984 --> 40:20.351
What are you talking about?

40:20.353 --> 40:22.920
Robert Zane
made me a promise.

40:22.922 --> 40:27.324
The next name that goes up
on the wall is mine.

40:27.326 --> 40:29.126
Why are you telling me this?

40:29.128 --> 40:30.261
Because we're never going
to trust each other

40:30.263 --> 40:32.530
if you think I'm trying
to get ahead of you.

40:32.532 --> 40:33.531
I'm not.

40:33.533 --> 40:36.800
Because I already am.

40:38.971 --> 40:43.140
Good night, Samantha.

40:43.142 --> 40:46.043
Good night.
