00:01.022 --> 00:03.080
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:03.104 --> 00:05.148
What are they? Dread Doctors.

00:05.172 --> 00:06.383
There's a dead girl.

00:06.407 --> 00:07.985
You know it wasn't Kira.

00:08.009 --> 00:09.219
My daughter's still alive.

00:09.243 --> 00:10.988
I'm just going to
have to kill her again.

00:11.012 --> 00:12.511
I'm here for a pack.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.581
You gotta give her the bite. No.

00:17.218 --> 00:18.283
Success...

00:19.153 --> 00:20.419
Eminent.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.989
Tell me where you are, Lydia.

00:46.013 --> 00:47.880
Tell me what you see.

00:51.052 --> 00:52.362
The bridge...

00:52.386 --> 00:53.852
Keep moving.

00:54.789 --> 00:56.733
Describe what you find.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.023
Tell me what he did.

01:04.465 --> 01:06.231
Stay focused, Lydia.

01:13.207 --> 01:16.019
What did you do to me?
I've amplified your abilities.

01:16.043 --> 01:19.078
Something that might just
save the lives of your friends.

01:20.948 --> 01:23.193
Now focus on the bridge...

01:23.217 --> 01:24.361
On Theo.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.563
Why did he let his sister die?

01:26.587 --> 01:28.921
I don't know.
You don't see it yet.

01:29.657 --> 01:31.668
Search for it, Lydia.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.225
Keep looking.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.631
Why did he let her die?

01:40.301 --> 01:42.034
What did he want?

01:58.385 --> 01:59.952
Her heart.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.225
He wanted her heart.

02:14.235 --> 02:16.034
There's no record
of a heart condition.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.452
But a transplant

02:22.476 --> 02:24.943
would make Theo a Genetic
Chimera like the others.

02:27.715 --> 02:30.560
The hypothermic conditions
would keep the organ viable.

02:30.584 --> 02:31.984
Theo.

02:43.397 --> 02:44.708
But why him?

02:44.732 --> 02:46.610
Why choose a 10-year-old

02:46.634 --> 02:48.267
willing to kill his own sister?

02:58.279 --> 03:00.556
Why do you care?

03:00.580 --> 03:03.540
Because Theo was a first step in the
right direction for the Dread Doctors.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.929
Think of who they are.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.598
Para scientists who have
prolonged their lives

03:08.622 --> 03:11.990
and twisted the laws of nature
in pursuit of one goal.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.661
The creation of
the perfect killer.

03:17.031 --> 03:18.375
And now they've done it.

03:18.399 --> 03:21.433
But Theo doesn't know
who the success is.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.048
The last Chimera.

03:25.072 --> 03:26.716
It doesn't matter.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.185
There's a reason they chose him,

03:28.209 --> 03:31.054
a reason he failed, a reason
they changed their methods

03:31.078 --> 03:34.524
and a reason
they finally succeeded.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.381
It all starts with Theo.

04:13.654 --> 04:16.120
Visiting hours are
well past over.

04:23.230 --> 04:24.730
We're not here to visit.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.602
We're here for Lydia Martin.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.858
When did you know for sure?

05:14.882 --> 05:17.060
That the Dread Doctors
had succeeded?

05:17.084 --> 05:19.629
Scott and Stiles
found out that night.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.064
The night of the Super moon.

05:21.088 --> 05:23.188
But they really
didn't know it yet.

05:24.325 --> 05:26.692
There was too much going on.

05:27.761 --> 05:30.128
Liam had almost killed Scott.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.843
Kira was still gone.

05:33.867 --> 05:37.080
Malia was trying to
find The Desert Wolf.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.236
You were missing.

05:39.707 --> 05:43.853
And Sheriff Stilinski
was dying...

05:43.877 --> 05:46.656
All right, we've got a liver
lac and perforated intestine.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.858
Where's my son?

05:48.882 --> 05:51.561
We're taking care of you, Sheriff, but
you have to keep your oxygen mask on.

05:51.585 --> 05:56.032
Contact the blood bank and type
and cross match for four units of O neg.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.101
Where's my son?

05:58.125 --> 05:59.869
Where's Stiles?

05:59.893 --> 06:01.587
Stilinski, right?

06:01.611 --> 06:03.306
You said his insurance was
with the county? He's a Deputy?

06:03.330 --> 06:04.774
No, he's the sheriff,

06:04.798 --> 06:06.643
he's the county sheriff. Okay.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.512
He's covered. I mean
he should be covered.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.570
I'll take care of it.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.184
I texted Scott.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.052
He's coming as soon as he can.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.554
I can call Malia. No, no, no.

06:17.578 --> 06:20.623
Don't, don't call anyone.

06:20.647 --> 06:22.258
Is there anyone
else we need to notify?

06:22.282 --> 06:23.360
A next of kin?

06:23.384 --> 06:24.883
No, it's me.

06:27.321 --> 06:28.754
It's just me.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.161
What's happening?

09:45.185 --> 09:47.052
You're a harbinger
of death, Jordan.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.422
Don't you know?

09:51.792 --> 09:53.369
Know what?

09:53.393 --> 09:54.859
Someone's dying.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.383
What are you talking about?

10:07.407 --> 10:09.708
I can't say how I know,
but Lydia Martin is missing.

10:10.377 --> 10:13.756
Parrish, you're missing.

10:13.780 --> 10:18.194
And some people here are really
confused by your behavior, me included.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.029
I know and I'm going
to try to explain it.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.731
But I need you to find
whoever's available...

10:21.755 --> 10:24.033
Parrish, no one's available.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.436
Do you have any idea
what's going on?

10:26.460 --> 10:29.806
The high school sign somehow
ended up in one of the hallways.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.441
The library is
completely wrecked.

10:31.465 --> 10:34.277
There might be a prehistoric
animal running around the streets,

10:34.301 --> 10:36.379
and I am starting to seriously
think about a transfer.

10:36.403 --> 10:39.248
Okay, listen. I promise I'm
gonna explain what I can later.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.217
But, right now,
I've got to find Lydia.

10:41.241 --> 10:42.707
Parrish. I have to find her.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.188
Lydia!

10:59.526 --> 11:00.759
Lydia!

11:26.486 --> 11:27.997
Stiles, you need to get up.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.288
You gotta get up.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.058
He's okay.

11:34.594 --> 11:36.939
Dr. Geyer is stitching
him up right now.

11:36.963 --> 11:38.841
Okay, I wanna see him.
Okay, okay.

11:38.865 --> 11:42.078
The anesthesia needs to wear
off. It's gonna be at least two hours.

11:42.102 --> 11:46.916
Okay, yeah, but everything's gonna
be okay though, I mean, he's okay?

11:46.940 --> 11:48.807
Mmm. He's gonna be just fine.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.478
Oh, thank God.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.031
Scott, wake up.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.288
Scott.

12:04.624 --> 12:06.102
Are you all right?

12:06.126 --> 12:07.270
Yeah.

12:07.294 --> 12:08.993
Yeah, I'm fine. You're bleeding.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.698
It's not that bad.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.645
Why are you here?

12:15.669 --> 12:17.402
I need your help. With what?

12:18.105 --> 12:19.237
With her.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.043
I found her out in the woods...

12:42.562 --> 12:44.040
It's a badge.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.296
A sheriff's badge.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.366
No.

12:50.504 --> 12:51.770
It's a warning.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.960
What do you think you're doing?

13:17.363 --> 13:18.741
Someone's got to tell
her about Hayden. No.

13:18.765 --> 13:21.110
Somebody doesn't have to be you.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.378
All right, especially
looking like this.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.669
I mean, what if they
think you killed her?

13:31.978 --> 13:33.122
Maybe I did.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.512
You didn't.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.918
And while the last few hours
haven't been your best...

13:41.655 --> 13:43.521
This isn't the way to fix it.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.960
She's going to find out,

13:50.630 --> 13:53.398
and it's not gonna hurt
any less coming from you.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.285
What?

14:22.729 --> 14:24.195
It's Hayden.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.399
It's her scent.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.285
She's here.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.054
You held her body

14:38.078 --> 14:40.105
in your arms.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.369
You... You watched Parrish
carry her out of the hospital.

14:43.783 --> 14:45.583
She's... She's gone...

15:05.672 --> 15:07.472
Hey, come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

15:10.777 --> 15:14.123
Help! Get someone
to help me. Quick.

15:14.147 --> 15:17.916
I need help. I've got an 18-year-old
female, potentially hypothermic.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.583
What do you mean you don't know?

15:40.607 --> 15:42.200
Two hours ago, he was fine.

15:42.224 --> 15:43.819
Now it looks like somebody
took a baseball bat to his neck.

15:43.843 --> 15:45.488
There could've been
some minor internal.

15:45.512 --> 15:46.856
Did you say, "Minor internal?"

15:46.880 --> 15:49.225
Since when is
anything internal minor?

15:49.249 --> 15:51.894
Stiles I need to know what's
going on with him, okay?

15:51.918 --> 15:54.497
Dr. Geyer, somebody needs
to tell me what's happening.

15:54.521 --> 15:57.188
Somebody needs to tell
me what's happening to him!

15:59.960 --> 16:01.025
We don't know.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.852
Where were you? You
trusted him. You believed him.

16:16.876 --> 16:18.888
Right, huh? So, where
were you? Hey, hey, hey...

16:18.912 --> 16:20.189
Where the hell were you?

16:20.213 --> 16:21.946
Stop it!

16:23.984 --> 16:25.216
Okay, all right, all right.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.703
Your dad's not
the only one who got hurt.

16:33.727 --> 16:35.293
Oh, you'll heal.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.697
I'm not talking about me.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.650
Everything's going
to be all right, Lydia.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.074
We're going to get you
the best medical care.

16:50.910 --> 16:52.410
The best doctors.

16:53.446 --> 16:54.912
The best everything.

17:03.757 --> 17:04.888
No.

17:05.392 --> 17:06.836
No, you don't.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.204
You're not coming in here.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.705
Get out! Just wait, wait. I
think I know who did this, okay.

17:10.730 --> 17:11.840
I just need to look at
the back of her neck.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.209
I know who did this.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.611
You. All of you! Get out!

17:15.635 --> 17:16.912
Come on, please. You
just gotta listen to me.

17:16.935 --> 17:18.180
You just gotta check
the back... Just get out!

17:18.204 --> 17:19.644
Just check the back
of her neck. Out!

17:21.540 --> 17:23.141
Oh, God.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.140
I told you to stay in the car.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.678
I told you to stay in the car.

18:04.551 --> 18:05.861
It could be a side
effect of shock.

18:05.885 --> 18:07.063
She's catatonic.

18:07.087 --> 18:08.531
It was Theo digging his
way through her mind.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.566
Why would he do that?
What is he looking for?

18:10.590 --> 18:12.835
The same thing he's always
looking for. An advantage.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.970
So what did he gain by
trying to kill Stilinski?

18:14.994 --> 18:17.105
It left me alone with Liam.

18:17.129 --> 18:19.241
Theo wanted to make sure no one
would be there to stop him from killing me.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.644
Okay, so he gutted my
dad as a distraction.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.812
We need to find this kid.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.981
Isn't that a little dangerous?
Especially since he almost killed my kid?

18:26.005 --> 18:28.050
Yeah, but he said he
didn't want my dad to die.

18:28.074 --> 18:29.251
And you believe him?

18:29.275 --> 18:30.519
He told me where to find him.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.054
So, maybe he also
knows how to save him.

18:32.078 --> 18:33.456
What do you want
to do? Talk to him?

18:33.480 --> 18:34.990
If it saves my dad, then yeah.

18:35.014 --> 18:36.792
I'll come with you. He
doesn't know that I'm alive.

18:36.816 --> 18:37.860
Maybe that gives
us an advantage.

18:37.884 --> 18:38.961
He'll know you're there.

18:38.985 --> 18:40.396
I just need to talk to
him. Not fight him.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.997
Stiles, you can't go alone.

18:42.021 --> 18:43.499
Does anyone even
know how to find him?

18:43.523 --> 18:44.722
We don't have to find him.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.024
He'll come to me.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.790
She'll be well taken
care of, Ms. Martin.

19:21.060 --> 19:22.340
It's a very different place now.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.407
She'll be safe there.

19:25.431 --> 19:26.764
She'll be safe.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.447
Just two signatures, Ms. Martin.

19:31.471 --> 19:32.615
Ms. Martin

19:32.639 --> 19:34.483
I promise I'll look
after her personally.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.385
Ms. Martin She'll be safe there.

19:36.409 --> 19:37.475
Okay.

19:38.645 --> 19:40.811
Ms. Martin. Ms. Martin,
who was that?

19:42.549 --> 19:43.714
What were you signing?

19:44.284 --> 19:45.895
She'll be safe there.

19:45.919 --> 19:47.239
What do you mean?
What did you do?

19:49.355 --> 19:50.555
I did what I had to.

19:53.226 --> 19:55.059
I guess we're all
telling the truth now.

20:08.308 --> 20:09.907
You killed my best friend?

20:14.080 --> 20:15.713
Let's be honest, Stiles.

20:17.116 --> 20:18.616
Was he still really
your best friend?

20:20.620 --> 20:22.431
Are you going to
let my father die?

20:22.455 --> 20:25.255
If I wanted him to die I wouldn't
have told you where you can find him.

20:26.826 --> 20:30.105
Then why are they saying
his body is shutting down?

20:30.129 --> 20:33.309
That some toxin's poisoning him
and they don't know how to stop it.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.711
I'm not the bad guy, Stiles.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.146
I'm just a realist.

20:37.170 --> 20:39.481
I'm a survivor. If you knew
the things that I know...

20:39.505 --> 20:40.849
Yeah, but what do you know?

20:40.873 --> 20:42.184
I know what's coming.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.208
I know what the
Dread Doctors created.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.756
And I know what Parrish is.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.593
No, there have not been any other
bodies brought in tonight, thank God.

20:50.617 --> 20:51.716
No one named Hayden?

20:53.186 --> 20:54.863
Mason, take him home.

20:54.887 --> 20:56.915
It's 6:00 in the morning.

20:56.939 --> 20:59.059
Dad, you're sure there have
been no other dead bodies?

21:00.493 --> 21:03.327
Both of you. Home. Now.

21:10.103 --> 21:12.403
We're not going home, are we?

21:12.905 --> 21:13.905
No.

21:17.110 --> 21:19.655
Well, we both know
where Hayden's body is.

21:19.679 --> 21:21.423
And if you want to find her,
you're going to have to

21:21.447 --> 21:22.813
find the Nemeton.

21:23.316 --> 21:24.927
Okay.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.183
Let's find the Nemeton.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.587
I need to learn to shut up.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.234
Lydia figured it out.

21:32.258 --> 21:33.535
I saw it in her memories.

21:33.559 --> 21:35.559
Right after you drove
her out of her mind.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.641
Collateral damage.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.676
But if she's right
about Parrish,

21:40.700 --> 21:42.544
then things around here are
gonna get a lot worse.

21:42.568 --> 21:44.680
I don't care. You should.

21:44.704 --> 21:46.482
Because if your dad does
survive he's not gonna be

21:46.506 --> 21:47.950
sheriff of anything much longer.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.173
What's happening to him?

21:50.276 --> 21:51.342
Hey, tell me!

21:53.613 --> 21:55.858
Stiles, you need to get up.

21:55.882 --> 21:57.214
You gotta get up now.

21:58.851 --> 22:01.830
Stiles. Stiles.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.821
Are you okay? Are
you hurt? I'm fine.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.603
You blacked out. I'm okay.

22:07.627 --> 22:08.871
Did you get anything from him?

22:08.895 --> 22:10.939
Nothing. He was calm
the entire time.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.374
What about his heart?

22:12.398 --> 22:15.199
I heard it jump, but only
once, and only for a second.

22:16.235 --> 22:17.601
That doesn't mean he was lying.

22:18.304 --> 22:20.215
Not really.

22:20.239 --> 22:21.583
The rest of the
time it was steady.

22:21.607 --> 22:23.574
When did it jump?
What was I talking about?

22:25.078 --> 22:26.958
It was when you said that
your dad was poisoned.

22:28.081 --> 22:29.291
That could be something.

22:29.315 --> 22:31.260
A jump could mean
surprise, right?

22:31.284 --> 22:33.329
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

22:33.353 --> 22:35.786
So why would he be surprised
that my dad's still dying?

22:38.324 --> 22:40.235
Oh, wait.

22:40.259 --> 22:42.779
He didn't say that he was the
one who attacked your dad, did he?

22:42.929 --> 22:44.073
No.

22:44.097 --> 22:46.097
Well, then this means it was
probably someone else.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.100
Another Chimera.

22:55.842 --> 22:57.274
Chimera...

23:05.451 --> 23:07.563
Stiles? Yeah, I can
do the rest myself.

23:07.587 --> 23:09.147
You don't even
know where to start.

23:09.171 --> 23:10.733
All we know that
it's another Chimera.

23:10.757 --> 23:12.134
Do you even know
where you're headed?

23:12.158 --> 23:14.439
Come on. Let me help. I can
find the clues that you can't.

23:19.799 --> 23:22.478
You can't do this alone,
okay. You need me.

23:22.502 --> 23:23.712
You need all of us.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.314
I can get more help.
I can text Liam.

23:25.338 --> 23:26.849
Liam just tried to kill you.

23:26.873 --> 23:28.372
Okay, then at least let me help.

23:28.941 --> 23:30.040
You believed him?

23:31.043 --> 23:32.143
You trusted him, too.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.324
Theo got to all of us.

23:35.348 --> 23:36.892
You know, you don't even
know the real story.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.182
I don't need to.

23:39.051 --> 23:40.951
All that matters right
now is your dad.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.665
Come on, Stiles.

23:43.689 --> 23:45.934
We survived an Alpha pack,

23:45.958 --> 23:48.303
a Dark Druid,
professional assassins.

23:48.327 --> 23:50.394
We can survive Dread
Doctors and Chimeras, too.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.768
We're not looking for
a missing Chimera.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.538
We're looking for
a missing teenager.

24:45.151 --> 24:46.584
Liam!

24:47.854 --> 24:49.086
Liam.

24:55.728 --> 24:57.061
All right.

24:58.197 --> 24:59.608
This is the one.

24:59.632 --> 25:00.843
You see these.

25:00.867 --> 25:02.144
These are Ley Lines.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.046
They're mapped according
to telluric currents.

25:04.070 --> 25:07.004
Stiles said that he and Lydia
were looking at the intersections.

25:07.707 --> 25:10.608
Probably... This one.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.188
But they never found it.

25:13.212 --> 25:14.745
They kept going out
there to look,

25:15.915 --> 25:18.894
but they said the Nemeton
has to want to be found.

25:18.918 --> 25:22.931
It's a supernatural tree that has to want
to be found in order for you to see it?

25:22.955 --> 25:24.066
Yeah.

25:24.090 --> 25:25.434
That's awesome.

25:25.458 --> 25:26.618
We should just make a copy...

25:43.175 --> 25:45.287
I'm going to find a way
to get her out of there.

25:45.311 --> 25:46.951
Even if I have to break
through the walls.

25:50.650 --> 25:52.283
Good luck with that Deputy.

26:03.896 --> 26:06.508
She's a pretty little
thing, isn't she?

26:06.532 --> 26:09.177
That pretty little thing could
shatter your skull with her voice

26:09.201 --> 26:11.135
if someone decided
to teach her how.

26:18.144 --> 26:20.222
There was a call a few
hours ago about a sophomore

26:20.246 --> 26:22.024
from Beacon High who
never came home last night.

26:22.048 --> 26:24.214
What's his name? Noah Patrick.

26:33.059 --> 26:34.258
Now we can catch his scent.

26:38.631 --> 26:40.642
You called her. We need
all the help that we can get.

26:40.666 --> 26:42.077
I should be calling everyone.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.634
And I know what
this kid looks like.

27:22.842 --> 27:25.342
This is it. There should
be a clearing here.

27:26.612 --> 27:28.779
Maybe the clearing doesn't
want to be found either.

27:41.527 --> 27:42.704
I couldn't save her.

27:42.728 --> 27:43.927
No one could.

27:45.765 --> 27:47.231
I was standing right there.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.145
Melissa did everything
medically possible...

27:50.169 --> 27:52.069
While I was trying
to kill Scott.

27:52.805 --> 27:54.238
You can't take all the blame.

27:55.041 --> 27:57.152
I mean, there was, like, 800

27:57.176 --> 27:59.021
extenuating circumstances.

27:59.045 --> 28:00.611
It wasn't just the moon.

28:02.481 --> 28:04.793
Then it was losing Hayden.

28:04.817 --> 28:06.650
In fear,

28:07.887 --> 28:11.633
anger, and Theo took
advantage of it.

28:11.657 --> 28:14.036
Or maybe it was just me.

28:14.060 --> 28:17.327
Liam, you're a werewolf.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.444
There was a full moon,

28:22.468 --> 28:24.168
a Super moon.

28:25.304 --> 28:27.137
And you can't let yourself...

28:39.085 --> 28:40.429
What?

28:40.453 --> 28:43.198
The Nemeton's a beacon for
supernatural creatures, right?

28:43.222 --> 28:44.599
Yeah.

28:44.623 --> 28:47.269
So what if it takes a
supernatural creature to find it.

28:47.293 --> 28:50.639
I am a supernatural creature
and I can't find anything.

28:50.663 --> 28:52.863
But you've been looking
with your human eyes.

29:13.352 --> 29:15.052
Mason... What?

29:15.888 --> 29:17.232
Look.

29:17.256 --> 29:18.388
I don't see any...

29:28.167 --> 29:29.466
Intense.

29:46.185 --> 29:47.985
He didn't want you
to call me, did he?

29:50.289 --> 29:51.388
No.

29:52.258 --> 29:53.524
Is it that bad?

29:54.593 --> 29:56.960
We kind of broke up, I guess.

29:58.197 --> 29:59.963
Yeah, we kind of broke up, too.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.745
Hey, you can tell me
what's going on with you.

30:03.769 --> 30:05.247
I mean besides Stiles.

30:05.271 --> 30:06.982
You can talk to me.

30:07.006 --> 30:08.350
I said I'd help find this kid

30:08.374 --> 30:10.140
and I'm doing it to
save Stiles' dad.

30:11.277 --> 30:13.155
Don't ask me to talk.

30:13.179 --> 30:15.257
Well, I'm not asking.
I'm offering.

30:15.281 --> 30:17.748
I'm just saying
it's okay if you want to.

30:20.186 --> 30:21.285
I know.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.099
I got it. I got his scent.

30:43.209 --> 30:45.086
Melissa, that man
in there is dying

30:45.110 --> 30:47.656
and I don't know
how to save him.

30:47.680 --> 30:48.924
I went to Harvard Med.

30:48.948 --> 30:50.959
I have degrees lining
the wall of my office.

30:50.983 --> 30:54.351
And I don't have the slightest
clue what's going on here.

30:55.621 --> 30:58.600
If you know something
about this that I don't...

30:58.624 --> 31:00.101
Me? Yes, you.

31:00.125 --> 31:01.525
Nothing seems to faze you.

31:02.561 --> 31:05.407
And not to sound accusatory,

31:05.431 --> 31:07.209
but it's
like you know something.

31:07.233 --> 31:09.666
Knowing something is different
from understanding it.

31:11.537 --> 31:14.850
Yeah, I could tell you things,
really bizarre things.

31:14.874 --> 31:18.108
But right now I can't tell you
anything that is gonna save his life.

31:21.146 --> 31:22.390
Then what are we supposed to do?

31:22.414 --> 31:24.915
Keep him alive.
For as long as we can.

31:30.289 --> 31:32.133
There's only four here.

31:32.157 --> 31:33.602
That means four
Chimeras are missing.

31:33.626 --> 31:34.803
I only care about one.

31:34.827 --> 31:36.304
Hayden's alive. She has to be.

31:36.328 --> 31:38.340
Okay, maybe you're right.

31:38.364 --> 31:40.108
Either way, we gotta tell
someone about this.

31:40.132 --> 31:42.276
We get the cops down here

31:42.300 --> 31:44.446
and they can figure out who's
dead, who's alive and who's whatever.

31:44.470 --> 31:45.569
Sound good?

31:49.141 --> 31:51.174
You two.
Stay right where you are.

31:54.079 --> 31:56.947
That's it. That's where
I found the bodies.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.319
Four of them.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.538
This is Noah's. He was here.

32:10.562 --> 32:11.562
I think he's close.

32:14.767 --> 32:16.611
Guys...

32:16.635 --> 32:18.313
I think we've been
down tunnels like this before

32:18.337 --> 32:19.848
like when we were trying
to find Liam and Hayden.

32:19.872 --> 32:21.316
Okay, so what?

32:21.340 --> 32:24.019
Maybe, it means we're
closer than we think.

32:24.043 --> 32:25.820
Maybe there's something
else down here.

32:25.844 --> 32:27.088
Something that we
haven't found yet.

32:27.112 --> 32:28.790
Yeah, nothing that helps my dad.

32:28.814 --> 32:31.848
Look, we can't just be standing
around here waiting for something to...

32:33.686 --> 32:34.918
Stiles.

32:36.055 --> 32:37.387
Stiles, you need to get up.

32:40.192 --> 32:41.258
Come on.

32:42.328 --> 32:43.593
You gotta get up now.

32:45.397 --> 32:46.875
You need to get up.

32:46.899 --> 32:48.165
Stiles.

32:48.567 --> 32:49.733
Hey.

32:51.704 --> 32:53.036
You still got me.

32:59.411 --> 33:01.078
You okay? Yeah, fine.

33:04.049 --> 33:05.482
Let me go, please, please.

33:08.554 --> 33:09.653
They're coming.

33:39.585 --> 33:41.429
You're not going anywhere.
I said I don't remember.

33:41.453 --> 33:42.764
You don't remember anything? No.

33:42.788 --> 33:44.966
Not when it happens.
Not when I change.

33:44.990 --> 33:47.469
You clawed my dad half to death,
okay, and now it's poisoning him.

33:47.493 --> 33:49.804
You're gonna start remembering
every detail right now.

33:49.828 --> 33:51.339
Scott, I hear them.
Yeah, I do, too.

33:51.363 --> 33:52.474
Hey, Stiles, get
him out of here.

33:52.498 --> 33:54.576
Go to the hospital. Figure
out a way to save your dad.

33:54.600 --> 33:55.677
We're not gonna be
able to stop them.

33:55.701 --> 33:57.178
But we can slow them down.

33:57.202 --> 33:58.468
Stiles, go.

34:19.425 --> 34:20.502
We're gonna be okay.

34:20.525 --> 34:22.259
Scott, we're gonna
die down here.

34:23.094 --> 34:24.393
No, we're not.

34:25.230 --> 34:26.341
How can you be so sure?

34:26.364 --> 34:28.208
Because you're not the
only one that I called.

34:28.233 --> 34:29.498
Get down.

34:52.091 --> 34:53.223
Run.

35:10.476 --> 35:12.020
Step back. I think
I can break through it.

35:12.044 --> 35:15.123
It's just sometimes, most
of the time, I lose control.

35:15.147 --> 35:16.313
So you better step back.

35:47.946 --> 35:49.146
Let's go.

35:54.253 --> 35:56.364
Dr. Geyer! We have
to open him up.

35:56.388 --> 35:57.799
What?

35:57.823 --> 35:59.534
There's something inside him.
Something that we didn't see.

35:59.558 --> 36:01.536
Melissa, we can't just open
him up. It's a piece of bone.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.771
He's being poisoned
by bone marrow.

36:03.795 --> 36:06.474
I know it doesn't make any
sense, I know what it sounds like,

36:06.498 --> 36:08.443
but you have to open him up.

36:08.467 --> 36:09.733
Do it now.

37:27.012 --> 37:28.745
It's okay, Stiles.

37:31.083 --> 37:32.782
You still got me.

37:51.637 --> 37:52.736
He was here.

37:54.873 --> 37:56.351
What else can you tell me?

37:56.375 --> 37:58.019
Why don't you tell
me how I know that?

37:58.043 --> 37:59.921
Noah's part Berserker.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.905
You're part jaguar. You'll
be drawn to each other.

38:05.150 --> 38:06.983
Is that why I'm here with you?

38:08.186 --> 38:09.719
I saved your life.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.393
What?

38:21.033 --> 38:23.444
I think he's dying.

38:23.468 --> 38:25.068
That means they're
going to find him.

38:27.205 --> 38:28.872
Probably already have.

39:03.575 --> 39:05.920
We could've used him.

39:05.944 --> 39:07.277
For what?

39:16.722 --> 39:17.987
What is that?

39:18.824 --> 39:20.023
A symbol.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.126
The symbol of an
Alpha and his pack.

39:24.563 --> 39:25.729
Whose pack?

39:27.466 --> 39:28.565
Scott's.

39:31.069 --> 39:33.314
It was more than
a symbol, wasn't it?

39:33.338 --> 39:35.271
It was a promise
to reunite them.

39:35.774 --> 39:36.884
Yes.

39:36.908 --> 39:38.152
But has Scott done it yet?

39:38.176 --> 39:39.509
Will he be coming for you?

39:42.381 --> 39:43.747
Someone's coming.

39:46.651 --> 39:48.451
But it's not Scott.

40:00.766 --> 40:02.543
You don't wanna do this, Theo.

40:02.567 --> 40:03.945
She's safe in here.

40:03.969 --> 40:06.603
The Dread Doctors don't know
how important she is yet.

40:16.648 --> 40:18.214
She doesn't look good.

40:20.051 --> 40:21.629
She has a hole in her head.

40:21.653 --> 40:22.986
It's not a good look for anyone.

40:31.229 --> 40:33.897
I can't believe this is actually
a medical establishment.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.544
Pick her up.

40:36.568 --> 40:38.746
We're getting her out of here.

40:38.770 --> 40:42.016
Now what would a pack of
Chimeras want with a Banshee?

40:42.040 --> 40:44.185
I don't want a Banshee.

40:44.209 --> 40:45.475
I'm looking for a Hellhound.

40:55.554 --> 40:57.020
You wanted a Hellhound...

40:59.925 --> 41:01.391
I think you found one.
