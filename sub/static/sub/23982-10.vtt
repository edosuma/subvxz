00:02.879 --> 00:04.839
Ah! Oh, gee!

00:05.590 --> 00:06.925
- Sam!
- I'm OK.

00:07.342 --> 00:08.426
- Sam!
- I'm OK, you?

00:08.593 --> 00:09.802
No!

00:09.928 --> 00:12.805
Now fuck off me, Sasquatch.
I can't breathe.

00:18.436 --> 00:19.521
It's Colin's girlfriend.

00:20.522 --> 00:22.398
Hey! Hey, you!

00:23.024 --> 00:25.443
Inside!
We saw you in Colin's house!

00:26.069 --> 00:28.196
Uh... tell us your name!

00:29.113 --> 00:30.073
Sweetheart...

00:30.573 --> 00:33.034
This... this is gonna go very badly
if it goes any further.

00:33.076 --> 00:34.911
The neighbours have
already called the cops.

00:35.161 --> 00:40.291
Open the door, set the gun down
where we can see it, then go back inside

00:41.125 --> 00:43.169
lie face down with your arms out.

00:56.933 --> 00:59.310
Pete?
I have no idea what he's up to.

00:59.769 --> 01:01.396
You were working together last week.

01:01.646 --> 01:02.814
That was last week.

01:03.356 --> 01:06.609
Look, if you're gonna shoot me,
shoot me, cos I'm tired.

01:07.694 --> 01:10.738
I know it's something to do
with the storage facility in Mount Vernon.

01:12.949 --> 01:15.827
Pete and Maggie were involved
in a robbery there three years ago.

01:16.035 --> 01:19.664
You take my advice, and you stay
as far away from that place as you can.

01:19.747 --> 01:20.748
Why?

01:21.708 --> 01:23.084
The owner is not a good man.

01:23.626 --> 01:25.003
I met him, Luka something.

01:27.463 --> 01:29.757
Do you know where your
family is, Audrey?

01:36.097 --> 01:37.473
I am so sorry.

01:37.557 --> 01:38.433
Shut up.

01:51.404 --> 01:53.281
- Is anybody else here?
- No.

01:53.948 --> 01:55.617
Oh, my gosh...

01:56.367 --> 01:57.243
Oh, fuck!

01:57.285 --> 01:58.911
Help!

02:04.042 --> 02:04.959
Sammy?

02:05.793 --> 02:06.753

02:56.886 --> 02:57.845
Rakija, no?

02:58.179 --> 03:00.848
You think they have rakija in fucking casino?
No, whiskey.

03:01.933 --> 03:02.809
Whiskey.

03:17.740 --> 03:18.825
Got any quarters?

03:18.991 --> 03:20.451
- For what?
- The slots.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.036
I want to make it look real.

03:22.412 --> 03:23.746
They don't take coins anymore.

03:24.163 --> 03:25.039
Get a card.

03:25.248 --> 03:26.541
No bucket of nickels?

03:29.460 --> 03:31.504
Bako. You have hundred?

03:32.046 --> 03:32.922
<i>Ne.</i>

03:38.845 --> 03:40.430
Any idea where the leak is coming from?

03:40.555 --> 03:41.973
No, I just called maintenance.

03:42.140 --> 03:44.058
Oh, and by the way,
I spoke to our slot guy.

03:44.100 --> 03:45.852
He said a bank of slots
doesn't come in a crate.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.937
Oh, really? Even the Excelsior 3000

03:48.020 --> 03:49.605
the new non-touch eye-tracking slots?

03:49.647 --> 03:51.816
OK, let's open it up and see what happens.
Maybe it'll get water damage.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.443
- Get the crowbar, no, get the crowbar.
- No, no, no.

03:53.526 --> 03:55.319
No, no, no, we can just move the slots

03:55.361 --> 03:57.071
and then, you know,
until we get the leak stopped.

03:57.155 --> 03:58.531
Why would you move it?
It's protected already.

03:58.614 --> 03:59.907
Alright, we're probably gonna
have to move the buffalo

03:59.949 --> 04:01.826
but I think it weighs, like,
600 pounds or something.

04:02.702 --> 04:04.954
Call Facilities, see if we can get
some moving guys up here.

04:05.455 --> 04:06.497
May I make a suggestion?

04:07.290 --> 04:08.875
For the time being, just cover it.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.793
That painter over there has a drop cloth.

04:10.835 --> 04:12.920
I'm sure she'd let you use it
to cover the buffalo.

04:18.342 --> 04:20.470
Let's just cover the slots too, OK?

04:22.096 --> 04:23.556
I'd better call Suzanne.

04:23.890 --> 04:25.558
Keep on maintenance to stop the leak.

04:33.524 --> 04:36.527
She climbed out of the storage unit,
kept crawling over the ceiling

04:36.569 --> 04:38.446
until she got to the bathroom,
knew it'd be unlocked.

04:38.654 --> 04:39.906
OK, but she got out.

04:39.989 --> 04:41.491
Why the hell would she stay there?

04:41.741 --> 04:44.827
Figured it'd be safer than being
on the street with Luis looking for her.

04:45.328 --> 04:46.829
How much of a lead does Colin have?

04:47.121 --> 04:48.164
Ten minutes.

04:49.123 --> 04:51.083
- Go.
- No, no.

04:52.001 --> 04:53.878
- Not until the ambulance gets here.
- Go.

04:53.961 --> 04:57.173
Unless you're gonna give me a transfusion,
you're useless here.

05:03.012 --> 05:04.347
Hey, does this make us even?

05:04.639 --> 05:05.515
For what?

05:06.390 --> 05:07.517
Vietnam.

05:08.226 --> 05:09.644
I just saved your life.

05:09.852 --> 05:12.188
Yeah, before I called the ambulance.

05:12.897 --> 05:16.317
So technically,
I saved your life more recently.

05:17.109 --> 05:18.027
Asshole.

05:18.319 --> 05:19.654
Takes one to know one!

05:20.238 --> 05:22.448
Hey, I thought you were the bad guys.

05:22.615 --> 05:23.533
Julia?

05:24.283 --> 05:25.326
It's Grandpa.

05:26.035 --> 05:27.245
You're in danger.

05:27.745 --> 05:29.330
Come on.

05:32.834 --> 05:33.918
What are you doing?

05:34.293 --> 05:36.045
It went straight to Otto's voicemail.

05:36.087 --> 05:37.839
I'll text him. Jesus.

05:40.550 --> 05:42.343
- Is it Otto?
- No, it's Taylor.

05:42.468 --> 05:44.846
- Well, give it to me. Give it to me.
- Jesus...

05:44.929 --> 05:46.681
- Yes?
- Where are you?

05:46.806 --> 05:48.599
<i>Headed back from New York, why?</i>

05:49.100 --> 05:50.393
You need to turn around.

05:51.352 --> 05:54.689
Roby got the test results back from
the blood she found on Winslow's car.

05:55.398 --> 05:58.192
It belongs to a
post-menopausal Caucasian...

05:58.234 --> 05:59.694
- Hey, Taylor.
- Hey.

05:59.819 --> 06:01.028
Caucasian woman.

06:01.612 --> 06:02.697
<i>Grandma, she's...</i>

06:03.030 --> 06:04.407
<i>she's gonna want a cheek swab.</i>

06:04.490 --> 06:06.033
She has more than enough for a warrant.

06:06.075 --> 06:08.119
Once she has your DNA,
she'll be able to put you in the car

06:08.160 --> 06:10.162
with Winslow on the night he died.

06:10.830 --> 06:14.584
Maybe the cops will find the gun
that killed Winslow before Roby finds you.

06:15.418 --> 06:17.295
What you gotta do...
What you have to do...

06:17.712 --> 06:20.047
is stay away from the farm
for as long as you can.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.174
- I can't.
<i>- What?</i>

06:22.216 --> 06:24.552
<i>- Grandma, what--</i>
- There's a threat against the family.

06:24.927 --> 06:25.928
<i>What?</i>

06:27.096 --> 06:30.224
Pete and Maggie are involved with a man
who said he was gonna burn down the farm

06:30.266 --> 06:32.226
- with everyone inside it.
- What?

06:33.269 --> 06:35.313
Oh, for fuck's sake.

06:35.813 --> 06:38.399
<i>OK, OK, OK. Look, look.</i>

06:38.691 --> 06:40.359
I will round up Grandpa and Julia.

06:41.110 --> 06:42.403
Then I'm gonna go to the farm.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.656
You have Carly, so just stay away.

06:46.574 --> 06:47.658
Yeah, OK.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.831
- Look up Lori Tuttle in my contacts.
- Who's Lori Tuttle?

06:54.123 --> 06:55.666
She's an old friend of mine. She's...

06:56.000 --> 06:57.668
she's who you're gonna
be staying with tonight.

06:57.710 --> 06:59.462
- What? No, Grandma, I'm not--
- It's not an argument.

06:59.503 --> 07:00.630
It's not a discussion.

07:01.339 --> 07:02.924
I don't know what the hell's
gonna happen back home

07:03.007 --> 07:04.592
but you aren't going anywhere near it.

07:04.717 --> 07:06.218
- You shouldn't either.
- Look up Lori Tuttle!

07:07.345 --> 07:08.512
Gr...

07:12.600 --> 07:14.393
Hey, here it comes, here it comes.

07:16.562 --> 07:17.730
Why is it dragging?

07:21.317 --> 07:23.277
Think something's caught
in one of the wheels.

07:23.819 --> 07:24.695
Whoa!

07:36.207 --> 07:37.333
Oh, shit.

07:37.500 --> 07:40.044
This machine! This game is rigged!

07:40.336 --> 07:42.630
Help! Hey! It's taking my money!

07:43.172 --> 07:44.757
Somebody get the management!

07:45.007 --> 07:47.176
Anybody! Machine's not working!

07:47.551 --> 07:50.638
- Come on, come on...
- Somebody! Please!

07:52.974 --> 07:56.102
Ah! Never mind, never mind.

07:56.185 --> 07:57.311
Look at that!

07:57.812 --> 07:59.981
Look at that!

08:00.022 --> 08:01.649
I thought it was rigged!

08:02.108 --> 08:03.818
Come take a look. Yeah.

08:19.834 --> 08:21.377
One, two, three...

08:22.211 --> 08:25.172
Uh, hey, I got the green lights!

08:25.297 --> 08:28.509
I see the lights flash and everything,
but where's the money?

08:29.343 --> 08:30.511
Come on, where's the money?

08:41.689 --> 08:43.899
Where's the money?
You see the fine woman standing...

08:43.983 --> 08:45.860
Standing right there...
going away from me now.

I heard somebody say it went that way.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.919
Hey, I don't know if I'm really comfortable
with these expensive machines

10:26.961 --> 10:29.088
- staying here if shit's getting stolen.
- Well, get 'em out.

10:30.464 --> 10:31.590
You heard the man.

10:40.558 --> 10:41.433
Thanks.

11:03.622 --> 11:06.292
You, in the truck!
Do not move!

11:08.335 --> 11:09.587
Check the front.

11:11.881 --> 11:13.299
- All clear.
- Damn right.

11:13.549 --> 11:14.758
Let's open it up.

11:41.160 --> 11:42.578
...motherfucking chainsaw.

11:45.539 --> 11:46.624
It's empty.

11:47.041 --> 11:48.792
The buffalo's fucking empty!

11:48.876 --> 11:49.877
Yeah, we got nothing.

11:50.127 --> 11:51.337
You did it, <i>chief.</i>

12:05.059 --> 12:05.976
Yeah.

12:06.060 --> 12:08.020
- Where are you?
- Almost there.

12:09.563 --> 12:10.856
And what happened with the FBI?

12:11.065 --> 12:14.693
They took bait, hook, line, and sinker.

12:16.070 --> 12:17.279
Miro watched Maggie.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.073
<i>Where's Marius?</i>

12:19.281 --> 12:21.992
Last I saw him,
he and Gina were running for his car.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.958
I'll wake you when we get there.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.292
I'm fine.

12:41.387 --> 12:43.472
- Where is he? Marius?
- Not here.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.770
- I told you they would try to fuck me.
- That you did.

12:57.486 --> 12:58.862
<i>No fucking Marius here.</i>

12:59.071 --> 13:00.906
<i>Money must be in bags.
Where are they?</i>

13:01.657 --> 13:02.908
Bags still on the car.

13:26.557 --> 13:28.392
Motherfucker!

13:32.187 --> 13:33.439
We unpack buffalo.

13:34.565 --> 13:36.066
Open fucking case.

13:36.859 --> 13:37.943
Fuck!

13:38.610 --> 13:40.154
Buffalo's never been opened!

13:41.280 --> 13:42.239
I'll open it.

13:52.708 --> 13:53.584
Fuck.

13:56.337 --> 13:57.212
Nothing.

14:02.343 --> 14:04.345
Money never in fucking buffalo.

14:04.386 --> 14:05.971
What, they put on a whole fucking show?

14:06.430 --> 14:07.931
Buffalos, casinos...

14:11.977 --> 14:13.771
Right, they... they... they want me here.

14:13.812 --> 14:14.938
They don't want me there.

14:15.522 --> 14:16.523
Where?

14:17.524 --> 14:19.985
Why Maggie rented locker for fucking niece.

14:21.362 --> 14:24.073
To get entry code to get in.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.229
The place is still standing.

14:57.439 --> 14:58.732
I don't see anyone.

14:59.608 --> 15:01.026
You in Mount Vernon yet?

15:02.611 --> 15:03.487
Fuck.

15:12.746 --> 15:13.789
Otto.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.375
If you run into that little prick

15:17.501 --> 15:18.669
what's his name?

15:19.336 --> 15:20.629
Yeah, yeah, Colin.

15:21.422 --> 15:23.757
Well, if you run into Colin, watch it.

15:24.550 --> 15:27.261
He struck me as a punk
with something to prove.

16:15.601 --> 16:17.227
- Hello, Marius.
- Oh, shit.

16:17.853 --> 16:20.689
Hand me your gun, grip-first.
Very slowly.

16:26.111 --> 16:29.656
I was told someone might be coming
to burn this place to the ground.

16:30.699 --> 16:32.784
I didn't imagine it would be you.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.329
Oh, no. No, it's not... I'm not.

16:36.288 --> 16:37.247
No, my...

16:40.459 --> 16:41.502
Pete's mum...

16:42.544 --> 16:43.504
Maggie.

16:44.505 --> 16:47.257
She told me to come here
and to make sure that nothing happened

16:47.591 --> 16:49.551
to the farm or anyone in the family.

16:50.761 --> 16:51.887
Put these on.

16:57.017 --> 16:57.976
Ah, ah, ah.

17:04.858 --> 17:07.027
Now tell me what the hell is going on.

17:20.499 --> 17:22.543
Get in the driver's seat
and keep the engine running.

17:22.584 --> 17:23.460
We're here?

17:23.585 --> 17:27.130
If you get anything close to a bad feeling,
you get the fuck outta here.

17:27.172 --> 17:28.131
What?

17:29.424 --> 17:30.759
But this isn't Durham.

17:31.635 --> 17:33.887
We were supposed to meet Maggie in Durham.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.266
We're in Mount Vernon.

17:38.684 --> 17:40.185
Why are we in Mount Vernon?

17:43.230 --> 17:44.690
Cos this is where the money is.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.934
Listen, Valerie.
I know you're here.

18:23.437 --> 18:25.981
It's smart, coming back to a locked unit.

18:27.399 --> 18:28.567
My name is Colin.

18:29.192 --> 18:30.319
Luis sent me.

18:31.528 --> 18:32.738
He wants to make things right.

18:35.115 --> 18:36.450
I'm gonna disarm this lock

18:37.701 --> 18:38.827
and then we'll talk.

18:51.757 --> 18:52.924
Valerie, what are you doing?

18:54.259 --> 18:55.469
Are you standing on the door?

18:56.678 --> 18:57.763
Look...

18:58.305 --> 18:59.765
I know you're probably scared.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.642
Just open the door.

19:01.767 --> 19:03.060
Everything's gonna be OK.

19:24.247 --> 19:25.499
I remember you.

19:26.875 --> 19:29.461
Valerie, open the fucking door
or I'll blow through it!

19:29.544 --> 19:32.130
I'm Valerie's bail bonds officer,
and I'll shoot back!

19:33.215 --> 19:34.091
Shit.

19:35.884 --> 19:38.220
Bail lady, I told you what would happen
if we met again.

19:42.265 --> 19:44.476
Look, I got no beef with you.

19:44.893 --> 19:46.395
Open the door and walk away.

19:46.603 --> 19:47.854
That's not happening.

19:49.147 --> 19:50.148
Hard way it is.

19:52.818 --> 19:53.860
Who the fuck are you?

19:55.362 --> 19:56.863
We're both looking for Valerie.

19:57.447 --> 19:58.949
She's in here with her bail lady

19:59.908 --> 20:00.951
but I got here first.

20:01.201 --> 20:02.744
I got bail lady's cousin.

20:03.495 --> 20:04.371
Split?

20:06.665 --> 20:07.582
Why not?

20:09.167 --> 20:10.168
Bail lady...

20:11.920 --> 20:12.838
your cousin's here.

20:15.298 --> 20:17.676
- Pete?
- Julia, don't open the door!

20:17.801 --> 20:20.387
Look, Julia, you're out of options.

20:21.221 --> 20:22.931
Give us Valerie,
we'll give you Pete.

20:24.725 --> 20:25.600
Otherwise...

20:26.476 --> 20:29.020
he dies now, and we come through
the door and kill you both.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.439
There is another option.

20:32.190 --> 20:33.150
Fuck.

20:33.608 --> 20:35.444
Put down your weapons
and let my grandson go.

20:35.902 --> 20:36.987
I don't think so.

20:37.988 --> 20:41.575
Listen, numb-nuts, my cop grandson
is right behind me.

20:41.867 --> 20:45.203
You got about two seconds
to put your fucking weapons on the floor.

20:45.829 --> 20:46.913
Yeah, you can shoot me

20:46.997 --> 20:49.958
but they already know
who the fuck you are, shit-for-brains.

21:01.011 --> 21:03.680
Come on, kick 'em over here.
Kick 'em over here!

21:04.306 --> 21:05.348
Get away from the door.

21:05.807 --> 21:06.683
Julia?

21:14.191 --> 21:15.525
- You OK?
- Uh, been better.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.736
- What're you doing here?
- Yeah, what're you doing here?

21:17.778 --> 21:19.279
Tell you later.
Come on, we gotta get out of here.

21:19.571 --> 21:22.115
No, you go, you go.
Taylor should be here by now. I'll...

21:22.449 --> 21:23.617
I'll handle these guys.

21:23.784 --> 21:25.827
- Wait, Grandpa, you don't--
- I will handle them.

21:27.037 --> 21:28.288
OK, come on.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.627
Wait, wait, wait, Julia! Julia!

21:33.710 --> 21:35.462
- I'll go make sure he's OK.
- No, no, no.

21:35.545 --> 21:37.047
Go, go, go, go! Go.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.300
What you gonna do, old man?

21:40.884 --> 21:41.927
You gonna kill us?

21:42.469 --> 21:43.345
Kill you?

21:44.012 --> 21:45.680
Why the fuck should I even bother?

21:46.097 --> 21:47.390
Prove something to yourself.

21:47.557 --> 21:49.351
Let me ask you
just one question.

21:49.768 --> 21:51.436
You guys ever met each other before?

21:51.978 --> 21:53.271
The fuck you care?

21:54.856 --> 21:57.901
Cos your friend here,
he's the guy that stuck his knife

21:58.443 --> 22:00.821
in your old man's neck and killed him.

22:03.406 --> 22:04.574
Motherfucker.

22:25.178 --> 22:26.429
What the hell is going on?

22:26.471 --> 22:28.473
Can I explain later?
Right now, we need to get her to jail.

22:28.849 --> 22:31.268
I'm no safer in jail than I was here.

22:31.351 --> 22:33.436
Yeah, but in jail,
you're not my problem anymore.

22:33.562 --> 22:35.730
- Where's Grandpa?
- Grandpa is right here.

22:36.106 --> 22:37.691
- Where's Pete?
- Isn't he with you?

22:38.275 --> 22:40.235
Why the fuck is Pete here?

22:40.443 --> 22:42.696
Yeah, Pete can take care of himself.
We gotta go.

22:43.697 --> 22:45.031
What did you do to those guys?

22:45.115 --> 22:46.908
I just made an introduction.
Come on!

23:29.826 --> 23:31.453
I fucking knew it.

23:35.332 --> 23:36.666
He fucking knew.

23:37.334 --> 23:38.335
Bravo.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.712
So many clever people.

23:41.922 --> 23:43.548
Marius, I want to know about this.

23:45.842 --> 23:50.430
Maggie go to great length
to get code to get in.

23:52.474 --> 23:53.391
You?

23:55.393 --> 24:00.315
Uh, when, uh, Frank and Joe
brought me here for the first time

24:00.357 --> 24:02.275
I... I, uh I memorised it.

24:06.529 --> 24:07.906
You memorised it?

24:09.407 --> 24:10.533
Good for you.

24:11.242 --> 24:12.452
Hey.

24:12.827 --> 24:14.996
You know how money end up behind wall?

24:15.789 --> 24:17.791
Maggie just tells me. Good story.

24:18.124 --> 24:22.212
I was fixing wall after FBI tore it open

24:22.462 --> 24:26.883
was when Maggie and boyfriend found money.

24:27.425 --> 24:32.514
Boyfriend, bleeding,
looking for hiding spot for money

24:33.139 --> 24:37.978
unscrewed drywall, hide money,
screw back in.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.318
That make you laugh?

24:47.070 --> 24:49.447
Me here, money right there, whole time?

24:50.573 --> 24:51.908
Is that funny to you?

24:52.075 --> 24:55.495
Is good joke to end on.

25:00.250 --> 25:01.501
Hey, so...

25:06.423 --> 25:11.428
Maggie tell me to wait for you
to show up before I kill her.

25:12.637 --> 25:18.685
Says you are reason
she is here with my money.

25:20.061 --> 25:22.272
I... I don't know what that... that means.

25:22.605 --> 25:23.648
- No?
- No.

25:28.028 --> 25:29.362
- What?
- No?

25:30.071 --> 25:33.908
What? First she is here, now you are here.

25:37.495 --> 25:38.747
It's coincidence.

25:38.830 --> 25:39.789
Coincidence?

25:39.873 --> 25:43.126
Oh, no, no, it's not a...
it's not a... it's not a coincidence, no.

25:43.668 --> 25:45.336
I... I figured it out.

25:46.046 --> 25:48.423
A couple of days ago,
I tried to open the buffalo

25:48.965 --> 25:50.300
and she stopped me

25:53.053 --> 25:55.972
and that's when I knew the...
the money wasn't in the buffalo

25:56.431 --> 25:59.350
and then when she, um, rented the locker

26:01.061 --> 26:02.145
for Julia

26:02.979 --> 26:04.981
I knew the money was still here.

26:06.858 --> 26:07.734
Somewhere.

26:08.860 --> 26:11.362
But you still need
Maggie to show you where?

26:13.198 --> 26:14.074
Yeah.

26:14.324 --> 26:16.367
And if you'd been faster, you'd be gone.

26:16.451 --> 26:17.410
That was plan?

26:17.452 --> 26:19.037
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

26:19.329 --> 26:20.580
This fucker...

26:29.047 --> 26:30.882
All you had to do was trust me.

26:31.382 --> 26:32.759
Like you trusted me?

26:32.801 --> 26:35.136
$11 million is big payday.

26:36.888 --> 26:38.556
Why not work together?

26:38.973 --> 26:43.061
I had to do it this way
so that I could give it back to you.

26:44.270 --> 26:47.273
- A lie.
- I swear, it's not a lie.

26:48.233 --> 26:50.318
No? What, then?

26:51.444 --> 26:52.946
You have fucking vision?

26:53.863 --> 26:54.739
Yes.

26:55.824 --> 26:57.492
Of your future.

26:58.201 --> 26:59.077
Huh?

27:00.078 --> 27:01.037
Tell.

27:01.913 --> 27:03.331
What is my future?

27:09.129 --> 27:10.922
I can't... I can't.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.521
Gypsy fucking bullshit.

27:28.857 --> 27:30.942
I pour you some of my special brew.

27:33.194 --> 27:35.238
Luka, you have the money.
You won.

27:35.572 --> 27:36.739
Doesn't matter.

27:36.823 --> 27:39.284
- Frank understands.
- That I do.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.787
You make big show for Luka.

27:44.998 --> 27:48.418
Buffalo, casino, secret meeting...

27:49.836 --> 27:51.129
all lies.

27:58.636 --> 28:00.722
You lie with mouth.

28:01.514 --> 28:02.891
- You lose mouth.
- No, no, no!

28:02.932 --> 28:04.142
- She's not lying!
- Shut up!

28:04.184 --> 28:05.101
She's not lying!

28:13.026 --> 28:15.695
For that, you drink first.

28:15.820 --> 28:18.323
- I know... I know what her vision is.
- Say it.

28:19.574 --> 28:21.784
- Say it!
- She's been working me all along.

28:21.826 --> 28:23.786
She... she want...

28:24.954 --> 28:26.497
She wanted me to protect her.

28:27.457 --> 28:29.125
What is vision?

28:32.503 --> 28:34.380
It's that I kill you.

28:45.600 --> 28:48.144
You think con man will protect you?

28:48.895 --> 28:52.023
Con man is cheat, sneak

28:52.482 --> 28:54.317
only take care of self.

28:56.611 --> 28:57.695
People change.

29:04.369 --> 29:05.662
What the fuck?

29:06.537 --> 29:07.705
Marius, put down the gun.

29:10.959 --> 29:12.877
Put down the gun and kick it away.

29:19.217 --> 29:21.135
Luka, you think
I'm gonna let Marius kill you?

29:23.596 --> 29:24.889
I promised I'd do that myself.

29:39.821 --> 29:40.697
Frank...

29:42.949 --> 29:43.950
Frank...

29:48.371 --> 29:49.580
I didn't kill Joe.

29:49.789 --> 29:52.375
If you hadn't fucked around,
Joe wouldn't have died!

29:52.583 --> 29:53.710
That's on you!

30:11.644 --> 30:14.647
Gina, take your gun
and point it at Maggie.

30:15.940 --> 30:17.984
What? What now?

30:18.568 --> 30:20.111
We're gonna take what we came for.

30:20.737 --> 30:21.988
Three people just died.

30:22.196 --> 30:23.906
Death is just a transition...

30:25.575 --> 30:26.451
right, Maggie?

30:26.617 --> 30:27.952
FBI! Hands up!

30:27.994 --> 30:29.245
Drop your weapons!

30:29.746 --> 30:31.998
- Drop 'em!
- Everybody down on the floor.

30:32.248 --> 30:34.167
- Let's see your hands.
- Don't you freaking move!

30:36.044 --> 30:37.462
Get some EMTs here now.

30:41.758 --> 30:44.093
See, Marius?
If you'd taken our immunity deal

30:44.260 --> 30:46.596
you'd be walking out of here a free man,
but you didn't.

30:46.888 --> 30:49.140
- How did you find us?
- We tracked his phone.

30:49.515 --> 30:52.894
So, we still got your cooperation,
and you got nothing.

30:54.312 --> 30:55.521
What about these two?

30:56.981 --> 30:58.399
No federal warrants pending.

30:59.150 --> 31:00.109
Cut 'em loose.

31:22.006 --> 31:23.216
Change of plan.

31:24.217 --> 31:25.093
What?

31:26.010 --> 31:27.261
I'm not taking her to jail.

31:50.535 --> 31:51.577
We got it!

31:55.206 --> 31:56.624
That's my boy.

31:58.626 --> 31:59.502
Yeah!

32:00.670 --> 32:02.755
We got it!

32:03.047 --> 32:04.090
Way to go, girl.

32:06.175 --> 32:08.136
- You didn't trust me?
- It's not about trust.

32:08.219 --> 32:10.263
It's about as few people
knowing as possible.

32:10.346 --> 32:12.557
- What happened?
- We came as soon as we got your text.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.267
You were supposed to call, not text.

32:14.350 --> 32:16.477
- Texts get delayed.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

32:16.644 --> 32:17.770
I had a knife to my throat.

32:17.979 --> 32:19.772
- Is Luka alive or dead?
- He's dead.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.525
So's Frank and,
uh, the bald guy.

32:22.567 --> 32:24.152
The big hairy one's in the wind.

32:24.235 --> 32:26.028
They were the ripcord?

32:26.362 --> 32:28.114
Oh, yeah, Gina, meet Adam and Nicole.

32:28.489 --> 32:29.490
Hey, how you doing?

32:29.866 --> 32:31.200
I thought you guys were real.

32:31.784 --> 32:32.910
Yeah, maybe a little too real.

32:32.952 --> 32:35.496
- Next time, warn me about that stomach punch.
- Fake is fake.

32:35.580 --> 32:38.166
Are we gonna stand here jawing
about our grievances

32:38.249 --> 32:39.792
or are we going to chop?

32:40.251 --> 32:42.378
- Let's chop.
- Let us chop! Come on.

32:44.297 --> 32:47.175
So... them chasing Luka
and the second buffalo?

32:47.967 --> 32:49.427
We needed to sell it to Luka.

32:50.052 --> 32:51.179
Let's open it up.

32:56.184 --> 32:58.895
- Where is he?
- 9 o'clock, in the trees.

32:59.520 --> 33:00.730
Too far to hear voices.

33:02.148 --> 33:03.107
Chainsaw?

33:04.192 --> 33:05.067
Chainsaw.

33:06.819 --> 33:08.654
But they had files on us.

33:09.280 --> 33:10.656
Yes, they had files.

33:11.991 --> 33:14.410
Files you never saw the inside of.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.497
Anyone want these magazines?

33:17.705 --> 33:18.956
Yes, yes, I'll take them.

33:19.457 --> 33:20.374
Nerd.

33:20.625 --> 33:21.751
Reduce his cut.

33:27.757 --> 33:28.716
You OK?

33:30.051 --> 33:30.927
Yeah, why?

33:32.470 --> 33:34.764
I've known you longer
than you've known yourself.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.266
You and Maggie worked well together.

33:38.976 --> 33:40.853
Yeah, until she tried
to pull a switch on me.

33:41.646 --> 33:43.481
No hard feelings.
It's all part of the game.

33:43.898 --> 33:44.815
Switch?

33:45.775 --> 33:46.734
What's this?

33:51.280 --> 33:52.240
Where'd you find that?

33:52.323 --> 33:54.283
It's at the bottom of one of the boxes.

34:17.181 --> 34:18.307
Marius?

34:20.476 --> 34:22.019
What's wrong?

34:39.036 --> 34:42.039
- Hello, Marius.
- There's a gun pointed at my head.

34:42.081 --> 34:44.375
If you don't give them the money,
they're gonna fucking kill me.

34:44.417 --> 34:46.085
<i>I decided to switch the money</i>

34:46.294 --> 34:48.921
<i>- when I realised your FBI were fake.</i>
- Of course they're fake!

34:48.963 --> 34:50.298
That's why they have a gun
pointed at my head.

34:50.840 --> 34:52.592
You know when I realised they were fake?

34:53.134 --> 34:54.260
They weren't in my vision.

34:56.512 --> 35:00.558
Maggie, your vision is gonna get me killed.

35:01.475 --> 35:04.020
<i>Marius, I applaud your ability to, uh...</i>

35:04.186 --> 35:05.146
<i>How do you say it?</i>

35:05.396 --> 35:06.647
Never drop the con?

35:06.981 --> 35:11.027
I saved your fucking life,
and this is the thanks I get?

35:12.320 --> 35:14.322
You know, when you look back, you'll see

35:14.697 --> 35:16.949
<i>your big mistake was not believing me.</i>

35:17.158 --> 35:21.287
Listen, listen, OK, look.
They're, they're agreeing to take half.

35:21.537 --> 35:23.039
Alright?
I think that's reasonable.

35:23.539 --> 35:27.543
The only time I ever lied
is when I said my vision had changed.

35:28.419 --> 35:29.587
<i>It never changed.</i>

35:29.712 --> 35:33.674
<i>The only way we get to be free
is giving the money back to Luka.</i>

35:41.140 --> 35:42.600
Open the fucking door.

35:54.028 --> 35:56.447
During this next part,
whatever pain you're feeling

35:57.323 --> 35:58.699
I want you to think of Reggie.

36:10.795 --> 36:13.297
- How much?
- Eleven million.

36:17.968 --> 36:21.597
Is that why they didn't say anything
about a threat to the family?

36:22.431 --> 36:24.392
- Because they wanted the money?
- No.

36:25.351 --> 36:27.478
The bad guy said if it looked like you knew

36:27.853 --> 36:29.814
that they'd kill all of you, that's why.

36:30.940 --> 36:34.902
And now all the bad guys are dead,
according to Maggie's text on your phone.

36:35.194 --> 36:36.070
Yeah.

36:40.199 --> 36:41.242
That should be her.

36:41.784 --> 36:43.119
That should be Maggie, right now.

36:52.420 --> 36:53.546
It's not.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.233
You work for Luka.

37:56.275 --> 37:58.402
I saw you in Mount Vernon.
What are you doing here?

37:58.736 --> 37:59.737
I have job.

38:01.405 --> 38:02.823
Looks like you have two jobs

38:03.324 --> 38:04.825
shoot me and burn down the house.

38:06.243 --> 38:08.162
Why would you want to do
something like that?

38:09.663 --> 38:10.706
I give word.

38:11.081 --> 38:12.666
To the wrong man.

38:14.794 --> 38:16.378
You go now, I won't stop you.

38:18.547 --> 38:19.423
If I don't?

38:20.841 --> 38:21.842
You gonna shoot me?

38:21.926 --> 38:24.345
You do anything other than
drop that gun, I will.

38:25.012 --> 38:26.138
Come on now, son.

38:27.848 --> 38:29.934
Your boss and the other gun thugs are dead.

38:30.392 --> 38:31.477
Just go.

38:32.436 --> 38:34.104
Maybe try another line of work.

38:49.954 --> 38:51.247
Maggie Murphy's mum.

39:21.193 --> 39:22.236
Got her passport?

39:25.322 --> 39:26.198
And the bag?

39:30.160 --> 39:31.120
Shit.

39:31.787 --> 39:32.663
What?

39:33.330 --> 39:34.248
Roby.

39:42.798 --> 39:43.883
Taking it all, huh?

39:44.675 --> 39:46.635
It'll barely cover
what we lose by you skipping.

39:48.345 --> 39:50.598
How am I supposed to get
from Canada to Mexico?

39:51.473 --> 39:52.474
Walk? I don't know.

39:52.516 --> 39:54.184
- I can still take you to jail.
- No...

39:55.394 --> 39:56.270
No.

40:05.029 --> 40:06.864
Does this make things good between us?

40:07.990 --> 40:08.866
No.

40:10.075 --> 40:13.495
But they will no longer be as bad.

40:59.124 --> 41:00.626
Marius told me everything.

41:01.961 --> 41:02.836
Marius?

41:04.254 --> 41:05.130
Is that true?

41:09.134 --> 41:10.511
OK.

41:15.182 --> 41:17.017
Well, Mum...

41:18.644 --> 41:20.896
it was the only way
I could see to get through it.

41:22.815 --> 41:25.317
- Did you get the money?
- No, no one did.

41:25.526 --> 41:27.528
Ah, then it was all for nothing.

41:28.529 --> 41:31.740
Oh, my God, Mum,
the house is still standing.

41:31.991 --> 41:33.492
We're all alive! Oh, my God.

41:33.575 --> 41:34.743
I gotta get going.

41:35.285 --> 41:39.123
I just came back to make sure
you were OK and, uh...

41:40.541 --> 41:44.044
see if, um, Marius here needed a ride.

41:46.463 --> 41:47.548
Yeah, that'd be good.

41:49.800 --> 41:50.759
Where's Pete?

41:53.846 --> 41:54.847
I don't know.

41:56.932 --> 41:58.350
I think he's mad at me.

41:58.976 --> 42:01.854
Things didn't work out the way he hoped.

42:02.813 --> 42:04.606
I think he'd want to come back
here, though.

42:04.982 --> 42:07.985
Given his involvement in all of this,
I can't say he's welcome.

42:10.320 --> 42:13.407
Well, Mum, you know,
you have a problem forgiving people.

42:15.075 --> 42:17.578
Maybe you could give Pete a try,
see how that works out.

42:21.415 --> 42:22.708
Will you, um...

42:24.585 --> 42:26.128
Will you tell Dad I love him?

42:27.421 --> 42:28.630
You could tell him yourself.

42:31.633 --> 42:36.680
No, I... I think I need to put, um,
miles between myself and everything here.

42:38.223 --> 42:39.141
Uh...

42:41.769 --> 42:42.811
Take care, Mum.

42:53.113 --> 42:54.656
You're an odd one, Marius.

42:57.326 --> 42:58.410
But I like you.

43:12.674 --> 43:13.717
You know...

43:15.511 --> 43:17.429
You never apologised.

43:19.932 --> 43:21.100
Neither did you.

43:26.939 --> 43:27.815
I...

43:31.485 --> 43:32.486
Audrey Bernhardt.

43:34.863 --> 43:36.281
Oh, hello, detective.

43:36.907 --> 43:39.034
- You leave the package?
- Yeah, I did.

43:39.201 --> 43:40.911
You didn't tell her who you are.

43:41.286 --> 43:42.329
I wanted to, Mum

43:42.371 --> 43:45.290
but then, you know, I figured, like,
with everything that's happened

43:45.374 --> 43:47.084
we can't stay here right now.

43:47.584 --> 43:49.253
What's the point in making things worse?

43:50.212 --> 43:53.132
Yeah, well, me and you

43:54.383 --> 43:55.467
we have family.

43:57.261 --> 43:58.345
What does Marius have?

44:05.978 --> 44:08.730
Look, I, I know this wasn't the score
we talked about.

44:08.856 --> 44:09.815
Not even close.

44:10.482 --> 44:13.360
Look, Marius,
it ain't bad for three days' work

44:14.528 --> 44:16.697
but you promised this was the big one.

44:19.449 --> 44:20.409
Where you going?

44:21.493 --> 44:22.452
I don't know.

44:23.036 --> 44:25.747
I just hope it's somewhere
you can't find me.

44:27.624 --> 44:29.251
Eleven million, almost too much.

44:30.085 --> 44:32.796
Yeah, well, you know what they say,
go big or go to Canada.

44:33.422 --> 44:35.924
You almost ended up in a tub of acid,
you know that?

44:36.300 --> 44:37.718
The key word there is "almost."

44:38.510 --> 44:39.761
There's another "almost."

44:41.305 --> 44:43.098
You almost killed a man.

44:45.058 --> 44:46.268
You think about that.

45:06.914 --> 45:07.873
Hello.

45:07.915 --> 45:10.417
Look, Detective, I don't know why
you've got my grandmother in your sights

45:10.459 --> 45:11.793
but I'm advising her to lawyer up.

45:12.669 --> 45:13.545
Really?

45:14.004 --> 45:15.881
Well, when I talked to her

45:15.923 --> 45:18.383
- she said she'd give a cheek swab voluntarily.
- You talked to her?

45:18.675 --> 45:20.010
- Just now.
- Without telling me?

45:20.427 --> 45:21.470
Well, we already spoke.

45:21.595 --> 45:25.307
- Did you Mirandize her?
- Oh, Officer Bowman, please, just listen.

45:26.225 --> 45:27.684
When I spoke to her, I told her

45:27.726 --> 45:29.937
that a cheek swab
would not be necessary at this time.

45:31.438 --> 45:33.440
A text came in
to the Connecticut state tip line

45:33.523 --> 45:36.068
saying there was a gun at an address

45:36.151 --> 45:38.362
that may be linked
to the murder of an NYPD cop.

45:40.447 --> 45:41.365
Wow.

45:41.823 --> 45:42.741
It gets better.

45:43.450 --> 45:45.744
Staties say the owner of the house

45:46.161 --> 45:48.538
has been on their radar
as a possible contract killer.

45:49.206 --> 45:50.082
Holy shit.

45:50.165 --> 45:52.834
And the suspected hitman's son
has a girlfriend

45:53.252 --> 45:54.628
apparently they all live together

45:54.836 --> 45:57.631
and said girlfriend shot a man in
Bridgeport earlier this morning.

45:58.423 --> 45:59.466
Given that tip

45:59.925 --> 46:01.885
state police ordered
a preliminary comparison

46:01.927 --> 46:03.804
between the slug from
this morning's shooting

46:04.012 --> 46:05.722
and a slug from Winslow's chest

46:05.889 --> 46:08.308
and they say it's a match.

46:08.976 --> 46:09.893
No shit?

46:10.102 --> 46:11.645
No shit indeed.

46:13.063 --> 46:13.981
Wow.

46:15.607 --> 46:18.277
Wow, I guess you'll be sticking around
a little bit longer, then.

46:18.902 --> 46:19.945
Sadly, no.

46:21.071 --> 46:22.864
Captain called, needs me back in the city.

46:23.323 --> 46:25.033
Case is once again in Bridgeport hands.

46:26.243 --> 46:28.537
My guess,
they'll stick with the original theory.

46:29.079 --> 46:31.039
Winslow was a dirty cop, killed by a pro.

46:33.375 --> 46:34.293
Or...

46:36.044 --> 46:37.170
Your grandmother shot him.

46:37.546 --> 46:41.049
By accident, I'm sure. She doesn't come
across as a stone-cold killer

46:41.758 --> 46:42.718
and you covered it up

46:45.137 --> 46:46.722
planted the gun at the hitman's house

46:47.431 --> 46:48.932
texted the tip from a burner

46:49.933 --> 46:51.560
and let nature take its course.

46:57.441 --> 46:59.526
But I'm gonna go with option A.

47:01.111 --> 47:02.446
Dirtbag-on-dirtbag crime.

47:03.280 --> 47:04.323
Makes a lot more sense.

47:06.491 --> 47:09.703
If you're ever in the city, give me a ring.
I owe you a meal.

47:13.373 --> 47:14.708
It worked, what Taylor did.

47:16.960 --> 47:17.836
For now.

47:19.046 --> 47:21.965
They have a dirty cop's murder
and a dead hitman to pin it on.

47:22.549 --> 47:24.509
File is closed, trust me.

47:26.636 --> 47:27.721
What about all the rest?

47:28.555 --> 47:30.390
Bodies, bodies in Mount Vernon?

47:31.141 --> 47:33.060
Bad guys all around.
No one gives a shit.

47:34.394 --> 47:35.437
Sam got shot.

47:35.937 --> 47:39.983
Yeah, he told them he was tracing a skip,
and then he pulled the age card

47:40.025 --> 47:41.485
said he couldn't remember any more.

47:45.238 --> 47:46.865
She didn't say if she was coming back?

47:47.783 --> 47:48.909
All she said, I told you.

47:50.035 --> 47:50.911
Well...

47:52.454 --> 47:53.622
It was good seeing her.

47:55.207 --> 47:56.291
What a price.

48:03.924 --> 48:05.258
I'm not sorry, Carly.

48:06.468 --> 48:09.262
I'd do anything to protect you,
even piss you off.

48:12.265 --> 48:13.934
- Is everyone OK?
- Yes.

48:15.602 --> 48:16.978
Hey, want a sandwich?

48:17.521 --> 48:18.563
I want sleep.

49:24.379 --> 49:25.297
Mrs Reid.

49:26.423 --> 49:27.466
What can I help you with?

49:28.633 --> 49:29.676
Where can we talk?

49:33.346 --> 49:34.306
Stay there.

49:34.723 --> 49:36.433
We don't wanna raise any more eyebrows.

49:36.683 --> 49:37.767
What does it matter?

49:38.101 --> 49:39.519
Sean already knows everything.

49:39.769 --> 49:40.854
Yeah, I know. He told me.

49:41.771 --> 49:43.815
He also told me you were
fucking that New York detective.

49:43.857 --> 49:46.193
I'm not fucking her.
We were working a case.

49:46.276 --> 49:47.319
Taylor!

49:48.028 --> 49:49.237
I didn't believe him.

49:50.739 --> 49:51.948
I know you a little bit.

49:54.284 --> 49:55.327
Yeah.

49:58.622 --> 49:59.498
Look...

50:00.582 --> 50:02.042
my apartment's kind of small

50:02.334 --> 50:05.295
but we could make it work for a couple
of months till we find our own place.

50:09.299 --> 50:10.342
You changed your mind.

50:10.634 --> 50:11.760
Not about you.

50:11.968 --> 50:14.262
Just... just about leaving right now.

50:14.387 --> 50:16.598
No, no, I get it, you know?

50:17.224 --> 50:18.308
Timing's wrong.

50:18.892 --> 50:20.769
I need to be patient.
It's not a matter of "if"

50:21.144 --> 50:22.229
but "when."

50:22.437 --> 50:23.939
Oh, my God, you believed him.

50:25.649 --> 50:29.277
That bullshit he likes to spout
about love or money

50:30.111 --> 50:32.113
"If you say you want both, you want money,"
well...

50:33.782 --> 50:34.658
Fine.

50:36.326 --> 50:37.369
I want love.

50:38.870 --> 50:39.913
Then leave.

50:42.374 --> 50:45.502
Not until I know what
he's doing at Hartford.

50:47.045 --> 50:49.756
Used to be, putting your family
out of business was the icing on the cake.

50:49.881 --> 50:51.258
Now it's the cake.

50:52.300 --> 50:53.802
You need somebody on the inside.

50:59.182 --> 51:00.475
Mm, yeah...

51:02.394 --> 51:03.311
Well...

51:05.522 --> 51:09.568
If we're going to do this the right way,
then we need to set up a series of dead drops

51:10.360 --> 51:12.779
so that you can leave information
and I can get it.

51:12.988 --> 51:14.155
What are you talking about?

51:15.574 --> 51:17.617
Well, you're going to be our spy, right?

51:18.994 --> 51:21.162
So you need to earn Sean's trust back

51:23.373 --> 51:25.125
which means that we can't see each other.

51:26.876 --> 51:28.336
No phone calls, no texts

51:29.629 --> 51:30.589
no contact.

51:33.258 --> 51:36.428
And then, in a year, maybe two

51:38.555 --> 51:40.473
maybe he'll let down his guard enough

51:40.890 --> 51:43.768
to actually say something to you
worth hearing.

52:02.662 --> 52:03.538
Fuck.

52:16.134 --> 52:18.219
- You get some sleep?
- I will.

52:19.512 --> 52:24.476
I just wanted to thank you for taking me
on that little adventure to New York.

52:25.518 --> 52:28.605
It was fun spending time with you
and tracking down that woman.

52:29.856 --> 52:30.774
I'm glad.

52:32.692 --> 52:35.195
I've even forgiven you for dumping me
at your friend's house.

52:39.824 --> 52:41.660
But what I can't forgive you for

52:43.161 --> 52:44.829
is lying to me about my parents' death.

52:49.250 --> 52:50.502
What are you talking about?

52:51.294 --> 52:53.630
Aunt Maggie left me a bunch of letters
my mum wrote her

52:54.631 --> 52:58.843
and this one is postmarked
the day before Mum and Pop were killed.

53:00.512 --> 53:01.388
Read it.

53:02.013 --> 53:05.016
And then maybe you can tell me
how everything you've told me isn't a lie.

53:17.237 --> 53:18.405
I backed out, Marius

53:18.446 --> 53:20.490
so, technically speaking,
you don't owe me anything

53:22.575 --> 53:23.993
but that is certainly not enough.

53:24.411 --> 53:25.537
The rest was soup.

53:36.214 --> 53:37.507
Well, you made it out alive.

53:40.844 --> 53:41.720
Barely.

53:45.515 --> 53:46.725
I almost killed a man.

53:48.059 --> 53:49.602
Hey. Was he a good man?

53:50.103 --> 53:51.479
Do you know any of those?

53:56.234 --> 53:57.861
What do you think you're gonna do now?

54:01.740 --> 54:03.616
It's too bad you're burned with the family.

54:04.033 --> 54:05.285
No, I'm not.

54:06.119 --> 54:09.914
I got a call from Audrey,
checking in to see if I was OK.

54:11.207 --> 54:12.625
Pete didn't tell them anything.

54:13.251 --> 54:15.545
I thought he was desperate
to go back to them.

54:15.587 --> 54:16.463
I know.

54:16.546 --> 54:19.632
I guess he just didn't want
to turn their lives upside-down again.

54:22.177 --> 54:23.428
I did like the grandma.

54:23.720 --> 54:25.513
Yeah, yeah.

54:29.768 --> 54:30.685
Go back.

54:32.145 --> 54:33.563
I don't know. I guess there's...

54:36.232 --> 54:38.777
there's some con
you could run with bail bonds.

54:38.818 --> 54:41.863
Oh, for God's sake, Marius, come on!

54:42.822 --> 54:43.698
You like them.

54:45.158 --> 54:46.326
Why can't you just admit it?

54:46.826 --> 54:48.828
You really have the wrong impression of me.

54:49.078 --> 54:51.164
- Really? Yeah?
- Yeah, I'm a bad person.

54:52.499 --> 54:53.666
I'm a bad person.

54:59.130 --> 55:01.841
Marius, you threatened to kill yourself
if they harmed Julia.

55:09.808 --> 55:10.683
You.

55:10.725 --> 55:12.060
You sound surprised.

55:12.519 --> 55:13.520
<i>Shouldn't I be?</i>

55:13.645 --> 55:18.942
Listen, I'd like a chance to explain myself
to, uh, to the family.

55:19.484 --> 55:20.693
Why should we believe you?

55:21.236 --> 55:24.489
Julia, I... I didn't...
I didn't know what to do.

55:24.531 --> 55:26.199
That's why I wanted you to carry a gun.

55:26.366 --> 55:28.201
Did you have Carly carry a gun? Taylor?

55:29.077 --> 55:30.787
Taylor's a cop.
He always carries a gun.

55:30.912 --> 55:31.788
Shut up.

55:34.082 --> 55:36.459
I was just thinking
I could come to the farm, and...

55:36.501 --> 55:40.296
and say my piece and then if you never
want to see me again, that's fine.

55:41.422 --> 55:42.298
OK.

55:42.841 --> 55:43.842
<i>Thank you.</i>

55:43.925 --> 55:45.802
Look, I'm meeting someone.
I gotta go.

55:51.432 --> 55:52.475
Mr Bagwell.

55:53.685 --> 55:56.396
Ah, Miss, uh... begins with a B.

55:56.563 --> 55:58.314
- Bowman, Julia Bowman.
- Right.

55:59.440 --> 56:01.651
- Would you care to sit down?
- Thank you.

56:03.194 --> 56:04.112
How's your daughter?

56:04.737 --> 56:08.533
Losing a pet can be traumatic at any age,
especially for a child.

56:09.450 --> 56:11.035
She's getting through it.

56:13.079 --> 56:15.123
- But that's not why you're here, is it?
- No.

56:15.290 --> 56:16.207
No.

56:16.416 --> 56:19.460
Well, I hope you're not here
to make excuses for your ex-boyfriend.

56:19.919 --> 56:22.130
He was supposed to come see me,
and he hasn't.

56:22.380 --> 56:23.923
No, that's not it.

56:25.925 --> 56:27.093
Then what can I do for you?

56:29.596 --> 56:30.889
This is gonna sound a little strange.

56:30.930 --> 56:32.891
You know, Miss Bowman,
I work with ex-convicts.

56:32.974 --> 56:34.100
I live with strange.

56:34.601 --> 56:35.768
Alright, well...

56:37.312 --> 56:38.730
