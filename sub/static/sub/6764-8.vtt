02:28.695 --> 02:31.255
Morning.

02:34.468 --> 02:38.495
Do you remember what you were doing
20 years ago today?

02:38.672 --> 02:40.264
No.

02:40.440 --> 02:42.806
Why, should l?

02:45.579 --> 02:48.548
Oh, my mother's
making breakfast again.

02:48.715 --> 02:50.046
We better get down there.

02:50.217 --> 02:53.914
We'll be lucky to have a dish left
before she leaves.

02:55.155 --> 02:58.488
l hope Brandon got to the airport
on time to pick up my parents.

02:58.658 --> 03:02.253
You know how crazy they get
whenever anyone's late.

03:02.429 --> 03:04.829
Don't worry, everybody will be
on their best behavior.

03:04.998 --> 03:07.728
Well, l hope so.
Come on, let's get dressed.

03:07.901 --> 03:09.027
Wait a second.

03:11.204 --> 03:12.262
Come here.

03:14.808 --> 03:16.708
What?

03:19.045 --> 03:21.240
This is for you.

03:29.756 --> 03:31.383
Jim, it's beautiful.

03:31.558 --> 03:34.459
The jeweler said that 20
was our emerald anniversary.

03:39.299 --> 03:40.630
lt's gorgeous.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.358
So are you.

03:48.542 --> 03:50.476
Hey.

03:50.911 --> 03:53.038
Thanks for an incredible 20 years.

03:54.447 --> 03:57.439
Yeah. Me too.

03:59.185 --> 04:01.346
Grandma?

04:01.521 --> 04:02.818
Oh, let me help you with that.

04:02.989 --> 04:05.822
l don't know,
it just slipped out of my hands.

04:05.992 --> 04:08.290
Don't worry about it.

04:08.962 --> 04:11.396
So how many people
are coming to the party tonight?

04:11.565 --> 04:13.430
l don't know, about 50 or so.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.363
Then what does your mother
need a caterer for?

04:15.535 --> 04:17.264
We could have
handled that ourselves.

04:17.437 --> 04:20.269
l could've made my asparagus rolls,
a few big turkeys.

04:20.440 --> 04:24.206
Well, Grandma, l'm sure that Mom
wanted you to be a guest, not the chef.

04:24.377 --> 04:26.504
Well, your mother
never did like my cooking.

04:26.680 --> 04:27.704
Grandma.

04:27.881 --> 04:30.247
Well, in my day,
people didn't hire caterers.

04:30.417 --> 04:32.351
Well, this is Beverly Hills,
not Minnesota.

04:32.519 --> 04:35.079
And believe it or not,
they even have caterers in Minnesota.

04:35.255 --> 04:38.053
As a matter of fact,
Grandma Beevis uses one all the time.

04:38.658 --> 04:40.023
l'm sure she does.

04:40.193 --> 04:41.854
Grandma, be nice.

04:42.028 --> 04:45.122
Well, you don't have to tell me that.
l'm always nice.

04:45.298 --> 04:47.823
l'll run right out
and get the rest of your bags.

04:48.001 --> 04:49.491
- Thanks, Brandon.
- Thank you.

04:49.669 --> 04:50.727
Hey, here we are.

04:50.904 --> 04:53.930
Mom, Dad,
Grandma and Grandpa are here.

04:54.107 --> 04:55.699
Grandma, Grandpa.

04:55.875 --> 04:57.240
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

04:57.410 --> 04:59.469
- Hello, Bill.
- Georgette, how are you?

04:59.646 --> 05:00.738
Arlene.

05:00.914 --> 05:03.178
- Brenda, let me take a look at you.
- Georgette.

05:03.350 --> 05:04.749
You know, l think you've grown.

05:04.918 --> 05:06.249
Oh, you just saw me
two months ago.

05:08.254 --> 05:10.620
So l did.
Well, come over and give me a hug.

05:13.293 --> 05:15.318
- Hi, hi!
- Ready for a party?

05:15.495 --> 05:18.430
Oh, you bet we are.
Let me take a look at you, sweetheart.

05:18.598 --> 05:21.590
l think you've grown, you know that?

05:21.768 --> 05:23.633
Oh, that would be Stuart.

05:23.803 --> 05:25.771
l can't wait to meet him.

05:25.939 --> 05:27.372
Brenda has a boyfriend, you know.

05:27.540 --> 05:30.065
- Oh, is that right?
- A very wealthy boyfriend.

05:30.243 --> 05:31.505
- Grandma.
- Mother.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.240
- Hello.
- Hi, love.

05:35.415 --> 05:36.643
How are you?

05:36.816 --> 05:39.307
Well, you're just in time
to meet the family.

05:39.486 --> 05:42.182
Stuart, this is Grandma,
Grandpa and Grandma.

05:42.355 --> 05:43.515
- Stuart.
- lt's a pleasure.

05:43.690 --> 05:45.248
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

05:45.425 --> 05:48.758
Yes, now l see where Brenda got
her eyes and her smile

05:48.928 --> 05:50.088
and her cute little nose.

05:50.263 --> 05:51.958
Oh, how sweet.

05:52.132 --> 05:54.191
Well, you're a big hit
with the grandparents.

05:54.367 --> 05:57.165
Well, we have to go
on a last-minute shopping trip, so...

05:57.337 --> 06:00.363
Yeah, l gotta go too. l'm tutoring
a basketball player in sociology.

06:00.540 --> 06:01.564
ls he any good?

06:01.741 --> 06:04.209
Not at sociology.

06:06.913 --> 06:08.972
Mel, Erin,
what are you guys doing here?

06:10.250 --> 06:11.911
Guess who rang the doorbell
all by herself.

06:12.085 --> 06:14.144
Well, good for you.

06:14.320 --> 06:15.787
So, what are you guys doing here?

06:15.955 --> 06:19.686
Well, l've got a little situation,
l was hoping you could help me out.

06:19.859 --> 06:20.883
What's wrong?

06:22.028 --> 06:24.861
Well, Jackie wouldn't trade weekends
with me, so l've got Erin.

06:25.031 --> 06:28.831
Which would be fine, except that Nina's
doing a photo shoot down in Cabo

06:29.002 --> 06:32.802
and she's desperate for me to fly down
and spend the weekend with her.

06:32.972 --> 06:34.405
Why don't you take Erin with you?

06:35.742 --> 06:38.973
l love Erin, but l can hardly spend
a romantic weekend in Mexico

06:39.145 --> 06:40.442
with a crib in the room.

06:42.048 --> 06:43.310
l get it.

06:43.483 --> 06:45.542
l've got Erin's regular babysitter
all lined up.

06:45.719 --> 06:47.016
She'll handle everything.

06:47.187 --> 06:50.645
All you have to do is just
sleep at my place for the weekend.

06:50.824 --> 06:52.155
l don't know. You sure about this?

06:52.325 --> 06:53.917
David, please.

06:54.094 --> 06:56.756
l'd just feel more secure
knowing that you were there.

07:00.934 --> 07:03.095
- All right.
- Thanks.

07:03.269 --> 07:04.759
l knew l could count on you.

07:04.938 --> 07:05.996
Yeah.

07:06.172 --> 07:07.400
See?

07:07.574 --> 07:10.236
l told you you had
a terrific big brother.

07:10.410 --> 07:11.468
Are you reading?

07:17.183 --> 07:19.208
D'Shawn, how much longer
is this gonna take?

07:19.385 --> 07:21.615
Soon as l sink
20 free throws in a row.

07:21.788 --> 07:25.588
l didn't realize
tutoring was a spectator sport.

07:25.959 --> 07:28.018
Look, l won't be that long.

07:28.194 --> 07:31.459
Why don't you catch a workout
while you wait?

07:31.631 --> 07:35.692
Maybe white men
can learn how to jump.

08:21.080 --> 08:22.377
Hi.

08:22.549 --> 08:25.074
l hope you don't mind.
l usually work out with a friend.

08:25.251 --> 08:28.152
- Do you mind spotting me?
- Sure.

08:38.765 --> 08:41.029
Girl can pump some iron.

08:41.201 --> 08:42.828
l try.

08:43.001 --> 08:44.663
So how long you been doing this?

08:44.838 --> 08:47.898
Couple years. Not recently, though.

08:48.074 --> 08:51.510
l've been traveling places they don't
exactly have a gym on every corner.

08:51.678 --> 08:52.702
Oh, yeah? Where's that?

08:52.879 --> 08:55.074
Central America.

08:55.248 --> 08:56.943
l'm a cultural anthropologist.

08:57.116 --> 08:58.515
So you're a professor here?

08:58.685 --> 08:59.743
Yeah, l wish.

08:59.919 --> 09:02.979
No, l'm an ABD.

09:03.156 --> 09:04.384
ABD?

09:04.557 --> 09:07.253
Yeah, stands for
''all but dissertation.''

09:07.427 --> 09:08.792
l'll be lucky if l get my doctorate

09:08.962 --> 09:11.021
sometime before
the end of the millennium.

09:11.197 --> 09:12.687
Here l thought
you were an undergrad.

09:12.866 --> 09:14.333
Thanks for the compliment.

09:16.069 --> 09:17.093
That's it for me.

09:17.270 --> 09:19.261
Good set.

09:20.506 --> 09:23.236
- So, what's your name?
- Brandon Walsh.

09:23.409 --> 09:24.467
- Lucinda Nicholson.
- Hi.

09:24.644 --> 09:25.872
Hi.

09:26.045 --> 09:28.411
Listen, do you wanna
get a cup of coffee or something?

09:28.915 --> 09:30.746
l'd love to but l gotta meet someone.

09:30.917 --> 09:32.145
Your girlfriend?

09:32.318 --> 09:35.481
No, actually, just this kid
that l'm tutoring.

09:35.655 --> 09:38.681
So does that mean you're as smart
as you are good-looking?

09:39.125 --> 09:40.922
Smarter, actually.

09:43.429 --> 09:47.365
Listen, this may be kind of forward,
but could l call you sometime?

09:49.335 --> 09:51.030
No, l don't think so.

09:52.572 --> 09:54.733
But l'm here every morning at 7.

09:55.909 --> 09:57.536
Okay.

09:58.077 --> 09:59.101
See you.

09:59.279 --> 10:01.144
See you.

10:04.284 --> 10:05.615
Paul, bring it over here.

10:05.785 --> 10:09.551
Okay, Steve, l will show you just how
to space the tables down here.

10:09.722 --> 10:11.849
Put the tables over there,
under the trees.

10:12.025 --> 10:14.050
That's fine
if you like leaves in your food.

10:14.227 --> 10:16.354
Well, where else would you suggest
we put them?

10:16.529 --> 10:18.156
Closer to the dance floor.

10:18.331 --> 10:21.698
Well, fine. That way, everyone
can bump into each other.

10:21.868 --> 10:23.927
Look, ladies, ladies,
make up your minds.

10:24.103 --> 10:26.367
Or else you're gonna be
setting up these tables yourself.

10:26.973 --> 10:29.464
- ls there a problem?
- Well, there really isn't a problem, l--

10:29.642 --> 10:32.475
- The tables should be under--
- Ladies, ladies. No, no problem.

10:32.645 --> 10:35.205
Not if you tell me
where you want everything to go.

10:35.381 --> 10:38.282
Put half the tables under the trees
and the other half by the dance floor.

10:38.451 --> 10:40.681
- That's what l said.
- That is exactly what l said.

10:40.853 --> 10:42.616
lt's gonna be a long day.

10:43.790 --> 10:45.724
Paul.

11:10.683 --> 11:13.982
Heard you might be
in the market for some product.

11:14.587 --> 11:16.111
Could be.

11:16.289 --> 11:18.621
l'm Gus. Let's take a walk.

11:21.694 --> 11:23.924
Okay, Gus.

11:36.843 --> 11:40.210
So, what does a kid like you
need a gun for?

11:40.380 --> 11:41.779
Questions always part of the deal?

11:41.948 --> 11:44.178
No. Just curious.

11:44.350 --> 11:47.342
l got carjacked.
Some punk put a gun to my face.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.613
Fair enough.

11:52.525 --> 11:56.427
So, what did you have in mind?

11:56.996 --> 11:58.224
Let me see that.

11:58.398 --> 11:59.456
A Walther.

12:00.900 --> 12:03.232
You've been reading
too many James Bond novels.

12:03.403 --> 12:06.236
You got any better suggestions?

12:06.639 --> 12:09.631
You know, it's illegal
to carry a concealed weapon.

12:09.809 --> 12:11.504
Are you a cop, Gus?

12:11.677 --> 12:14.908
No, just taking an interest
in my clientele.

12:15.081 --> 12:17.015
Well, l'll take my chances.

12:17.183 --> 12:19.583
So, what do you think?

12:23.289 --> 12:25.587
l think l'll take it.

12:30.063 --> 12:32.588
l hope you're wearing sunscreen.

12:32.765 --> 12:35.563
Always. Hi.

12:35.835 --> 12:38.770
Do you ever actually listen
to your phone machine?

12:38.938 --> 12:40.599
l've been calling you all day.

12:40.773 --> 12:42.638
l wasn't home.

12:42.809 --> 12:45.300
Well, one of my frat brothers
has given me two front-row tickets

12:45.478 --> 12:47.946
to the Steely Dan concert
tonight at the Forum.

12:48.114 --> 12:50.173
And there's no one
l'd rather ask than you.

12:50.349 --> 12:54.183
l'd love to go,
but l have plans already.

12:54.353 --> 12:55.843
Let me guess.

12:56.022 --> 12:58.684
Dylan's having another crisis.

12:58.858 --> 13:01.326
Actually, l'm going to a party,
thank you.

13:01.494 --> 13:03.223
- Have a date?
- No.

13:03.396 --> 13:05.261
Well, you do now.

13:05.431 --> 13:06.864
lt's not that kind of party.

13:07.533 --> 13:11.833
Brenda and Brandon Walsh's parents
are celebrating their 20th anniversary.

13:12.004 --> 13:14.165
Okay. So l'll go with you.

13:14.874 --> 13:16.808
l can't take you to the Walshes' party.

13:16.976 --> 13:18.705
Why not? l have a nice suit.

13:18.878 --> 13:20.470
l'll take a shower.

13:20.646 --> 13:23.171
Kelly, l won't embarrass you.

13:23.349 --> 13:24.646
lt's not that.

13:24.817 --> 13:26.341
Dylan's gonna be there.

13:26.519 --> 13:29.283
So? l'm not planning
to dance with Dylan.

13:29.455 --> 13:30.786
You know what l'm saying.

13:30.957 --> 13:34.757
l just don't think it's the right place
for us to make our first appearance.

13:35.761 --> 13:39.026
So you're saying eventually we will
make an appearance together.

13:40.566 --> 13:42.227
l don't know what l'm saying.

13:42.401 --> 13:46.235
Okay. Then l'll say it.

13:46.973 --> 13:48.804
l'm crazy about you, Kelly.

13:48.975 --> 13:52.376
l can't eat, l can't sleep,
l definitely can't study.

13:53.246 --> 13:55.180
All l do is think about you.

13:57.450 --> 14:00.248
You feel it too. l know you do.

14:02.421 --> 14:03.820
Yes, l feel it.

14:04.857 --> 14:06.188
Then give into it.

14:06.926 --> 14:08.894
l can't.

14:09.061 --> 14:10.255
At least not tonight.

14:10.763 --> 14:12.128
Okay.

14:12.298 --> 14:15.461
l told you before, l can wait.

14:15.635 --> 14:17.398
Because you're worth waiting for.

15:18.130 --> 15:19.154
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:19.332 --> 15:20.924
- What do you have there?
- A present.

15:21.100 --> 15:23.159
- You'll see it tonight.
- Fine, l can wait.

15:23.336 --> 15:25.566
Hey, you need a ride?
l could swing by and pick you up.

15:25.738 --> 15:27.763
No, that's okay.
Dan's gonna give me a ride.

15:27.940 --> 15:28.964
Dan Rubin?

15:29.141 --> 15:31.701
You mean tonight l finally get to meet
the famous Dan Rubin?

15:31.877 --> 15:33.606
Well, you can meet him right now
if you want.

15:33.779 --> 15:36.748
Dan, come here. Come here.

15:38.718 --> 15:40.549
Hey.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.711
Dan, this is Brandon Walsh.

15:42.888 --> 15:43.980
- How you doing, man?
- Hey.

15:44.156 --> 15:46.886
- Well, where's your halo?
- Excuse me?

15:47.059 --> 15:49.527
To hear Andrea talk about you,
you're one step from sainthood.

15:49.929 --> 15:51.556
What kind of lies you been telling?

15:51.731 --> 15:54.256
l said nothing of the sort.

15:54.433 --> 15:56.526
Yeah, well,
l've heard a lot about you too, man.

15:56.702 --> 15:59.193
- We can compare notes.
- Maybe l should skip this party.

15:59.372 --> 16:00.839
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, no. No way.

16:01.007 --> 16:04.306
You just gotta accept the fact
that we're gonna tease you all night.

16:04.477 --> 16:06.502
Mercilessly.

16:10.750 --> 16:13.116
Hey, would you guys excuse me?
l got some stuff l gotta do.

16:13.286 --> 16:14.412
- Okay.
- See you.

16:14.587 --> 16:16.145
Nice to meet you.

16:16.322 --> 16:19.348
- He's a nice guy.
- Yeah, l know he is.

16:21.761 --> 16:23.854
So maybe we can have
that cup of coffee after all.

16:24.030 --> 16:27.193
Well, well, well, we meet again.

16:27.366 --> 16:30.096
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

16:30.469 --> 16:33.927
l can't stay long. lt's my parents'
20th wedding anniversary tonight.

16:34.106 --> 16:36.472
- l got a lot to do.
- Good for them.

16:36.642 --> 16:38.303
As a woman and an anthropologist,

16:38.477 --> 16:41.207
l congratulate them on being able
to put up with each other that long.

16:42.114 --> 16:43.843
No, l'm serious.

16:44.850 --> 16:46.579
People are short on commitment
these days.

16:47.019 --> 16:48.281
Some people.

16:48.454 --> 16:51.184
ls that your way of saying
you're a one-woman man?

16:51.891 --> 16:53.688
Maybe. Depends on the woman.

16:55.761 --> 16:56.989
You want a cup of coffee?

16:57.163 --> 16:58.357
Line's too long.

16:59.065 --> 17:00.327
Well, here, share mine.

17:00.499 --> 17:02.364
Thanks.

17:04.103 --> 17:06.094
- Sweet.
- You don't like it that way?

17:06.271 --> 17:08.172
To tell you the truth,
l don't like it any way.

17:08.340 --> 17:10.935
l don't drink much coffee
unless l really need to stay awake.

17:11.844 --> 17:14.938
- God, you're just a kid, aren't you?
- Just because l don't drink coffee?

17:15.114 --> 17:17.377
What's the matter, you didn't read
Diet for a New America?

17:17.550 --> 17:19.950
Okay. l can take it.

17:20.118 --> 17:22.916
Tell me, how old are you?

17:25.124 --> 17:26.785
- Eighteen.
- Eighteen.

17:26.959 --> 17:28.256
Eighteen.

17:28.426 --> 17:30.827
Gosh, l was 1 8 once too.

17:30.996 --> 17:33.692
Come on, you make it sound like
you're ancient. How old are you?

17:34.233 --> 17:35.700
l'm 27.

17:35.868 --> 17:37.301
Twenty-seven is not old.

17:38.571 --> 17:40.664
No, it's not.

17:40.973 --> 17:42.941
Except when you're flirting
with an 1 8-year-old.

17:43.509 --> 17:44.771
ls that what you're doing?

17:46.212 --> 17:47.440
Maybe.

17:48.147 --> 17:49.375
Good.

18:00.860 --> 18:03.055
Yeah, it's open.

18:03.229 --> 18:05.163
Hey, man. l'm just dropping this off.

18:05.331 --> 18:07.856
- What is it?
- lt's my parents' anniversary present.

18:08.033 --> 18:09.557
l don't want them to see it.

18:09.735 --> 18:11.168
What did you get them?

18:11.337 --> 18:13.703
We had their wedding picture
turned into a jigsaw puzzle.

18:13.873 --> 18:16.034
lf they take it apart,
it'll take them a lifetime

18:16.208 --> 18:17.675
to put it back together.

18:17.843 --> 18:20.209
l haven't really figured out
what l'm gonna get them yet.

18:20.379 --> 18:21.971
You don't have to get them anything.

18:22.148 --> 18:24.548
After everything your mom
and dad have done for me? l do.

18:25.351 --> 18:26.375
Okay.

18:27.753 --> 18:29.152
- See you.
- See you.

18:38.898 --> 18:42.698
David, which one should l wear,
the red one or the white one?

18:42.868 --> 18:44.961
Let me see.

18:45.504 --> 18:46.801
l think you'd look good in both,

18:46.972 --> 18:50.669
but honestly, l'd really much rather
see you in nothing at all.

18:50.843 --> 18:52.777
David.

18:57.516 --> 18:59.882
- Hello?
- David.

19:00.052 --> 19:02.577
l know that l told you
all you have to do is sleep over here,

19:02.755 --> 19:04.120
but l got a little problem.

19:04.290 --> 19:05.689
What's wrong?

19:05.858 --> 19:08.452
The babysitter is late, and l
really don't wanna miss this plane.

19:08.627 --> 19:11.824
Do you think you could just come over
here and hang out until she shows up?

19:12.932 --> 19:14.297
- Yeah, l guess so.
- Great,

19:14.467 --> 19:15.729
l really appreciate it.

19:15.901 --> 19:18.199
- Bye,
- Bye.

19:21.106 --> 19:23.336
We have to stop by Mel's
before we go to the party.

19:23.509 --> 19:24.703
- Why?
- Just get dressed.

19:24.877 --> 19:26.435
l'll explain it all later in the car.

19:26.612 --> 19:28.705
Wait, which one?

19:28.881 --> 19:30.974
- The white one.
- Okay.

19:35.821 --> 19:37.948
Do you feel a little weird
or is it just me?

19:38.123 --> 19:40.785
You know, l was just about
to ask you the same question.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.587
l mean, how did they do it?

19:42.761 --> 19:45.730
How did our parents
stay married for 20 years?

19:45.898 --> 19:48.492
More importantly, how'd they stay
happily married for 20 years?

19:49.068 --> 19:50.831
They are happy, aren't they?

19:51.003 --> 19:52.903
They sure seem it.
l don't think it's an act.

19:53.072 --> 19:54.869
Yeah, but how do they keep it alive?

19:55.241 --> 19:58.108
They still lock their bedroom door
every Sunday night.

19:59.845 --> 20:01.244
What do you think of Stuart?

20:01.413 --> 20:02.505
l hardly know him.

20:03.582 --> 20:05.311
Well, maybe he's the one.

20:06.318 --> 20:08.411
Bren, you've only known the guy
two weeks.

20:08.587 --> 20:09.884
Slow down a little, will you?

20:10.322 --> 20:12.722
l mean, Stuart may be the one,
Stuart may not be the one.

20:12.892 --> 20:15.326
You may not meet the one
until the year 2000.

20:15.494 --> 20:17.189
You've got a lot of time,
you'll find him.

20:17.363 --> 20:21.356
Yeah, well, life will be
awfully lonely if l don't.

20:23.536 --> 20:24.560
What about you?

20:24.737 --> 20:25.761
Hey, don't look at me.

20:25.938 --> 20:28.065
The only relationship
l've had last longer than a month

20:28.240 --> 20:30.936
was with that psychopath,
Emily Valentine.

20:31.110 --> 20:32.634
l'm a long way from finding it.

20:33.279 --> 20:34.746
Well, you will.

20:35.948 --> 20:39.179
Can we stop with all this sappy stuff?
My skin's starting to crawl.

20:40.052 --> 20:42.043
Yeah, what about the present?
l wanna set it up.

20:42.221 --> 20:43.745
Oh, no, the present.

20:43.923 --> 20:45.754
Don't tell me you forgot to pick it up.

20:45.925 --> 20:48.450
No, l didn't forget.
l just left it over at Dylan's house.

20:48.627 --> 20:51.425
Well, l wanted to give it to Mom
and Dad before the guests arrived.

20:51.597 --> 20:53.895
l'm going to get it right now.
l'll be back in ten minutes.

20:54.066 --> 20:56.057
Five if l make all the lights.

20:58.837 --> 21:00.964
Now, Jimmy, you put that down.
That's for company.

21:01.140 --> 21:02.437
Oh, come on, Mom, just one.

21:02.608 --> 21:05.771
Oh, all right. Go on.

21:06.512 --> 21:09.310
Good. Not as good as yours,
but good.

21:11.216 --> 21:12.513
Thank you for that.

21:14.219 --> 21:16.983
- l'm glad you're here.
- Me too.

21:17.489 --> 21:19.457
Well, l just wish
your dad were alive today

21:19.625 --> 21:22.856
to see what a wonderful man
his son has become.

21:23.829 --> 21:27.265
And what a good husband
and father you are.

21:27.433 --> 21:28.627
Thanks, Mom.

21:31.737 --> 21:33.830
That means a lot.

21:40.079 --> 21:42.013
What's this?

21:42.915 --> 21:47.352
Those are the rings your father and l
exchanged almost 50 years ago.

21:47.753 --> 21:50.722
You keep them.
Share them together.

21:52.958 --> 21:56.416
lt's the best present
you could've given us.

21:57.796 --> 21:59.730
And who knows?
Maybe one of your kids

21:59.898 --> 22:01.058
will be getting married soon

22:01.233 --> 22:03.133
and you can pass the rings
along to them.

22:03.302 --> 22:06.271
- Bite your tongue, Mom.
- Why?

22:22.187 --> 22:24.417
Yo, Dylan!

22:24.590 --> 22:25.614
Dylan!

22:27.026 --> 22:29.392
Dylan!

23:42.434 --> 23:47.337
- l got a gun, man. Don't even move!
- Dylan, don't shoot, it's me, Brandon.

23:52.711 --> 23:54.508
Oh, my God, man.
What are you doing here?

23:54.680 --> 23:56.671
What am l doing here?
What are you doing with a gun?

23:56.849 --> 23:58.783
l'm protecting my home.
Never heard of doorbell?

23:58.951 --> 24:00.145
Yes, l've heard of a doorbell.

24:00.319 --> 24:01.786
There was no answer.

24:01.954 --> 24:05.685
l had to get my parents' present,
l didn't see your car, l came in.

24:05.858 --> 24:07.849
My car's in the garage.
l was in the shower.

24:08.026 --> 24:09.857
- l almost shot you!
- No kidding.

24:10.028 --> 24:12.656
You ever hear of an alarm system?
lt might be safer for you.

24:12.831 --> 24:14.128
Hey, if somebody ever comes up

24:14.299 --> 24:16.893
and sticks a gun
through the window of your car,

24:17.069 --> 24:19.629
- then you can tell me about it.
- Listen,

24:19.805 --> 24:21.739
l know they stole your car.
l know it was scary.

24:21.907 --> 24:25.502
l know your dad got blown away,
but this isn't the answer, man.

24:26.512 --> 24:30.414
You're gonna kill somebody.
You almost killed me.

24:32.284 --> 24:34.616
l'm sorry.

24:35.254 --> 24:39.384
l don't know. l'm out of it, man.
l don't know what l'm doing here.

24:41.927 --> 24:44.452
Just do me a favor, will you, pal?

24:44.630 --> 24:45.927
Will you get rid of this thing?

24:46.098 --> 24:48.896
Stop playing cowboys and lndians.

24:49.334 --> 24:51.461
Yeah.

24:51.904 --> 24:53.929
l will, l--

24:54.406 --> 24:56.431
l just got one problem.

24:56.608 --> 24:58.303
What's that?

24:58.477 --> 25:02.573
- How do you get rid of a gun?
- You throw it off a pier.

25:02.748 --> 25:06.275
- Take a ride tomorrow?
- Sure.

25:06.451 --> 25:09.978
But tonight, we got a party to go to.

25:26.705 --> 25:28.673
Come in.

25:32.311 --> 25:35.803
You look better in that dress
than you did in the store.

25:35.981 --> 25:39.917
Thank you.
How come you're here so early?

25:40.085 --> 25:42.576
l could not stay away.

25:42.754 --> 25:45.188
Besides,
l'm practically one of the family.

25:45.357 --> 25:48.758
Well, you're just in time.
Will you help me?

25:50.762 --> 25:54.027
Think your parents would mind if we
skipped the party and stayed up here?

25:54.199 --> 25:57.498
Stuart, zip it up, not down.

25:59.471 --> 26:00.995
Thank you.

26:01.173 --> 26:03.198
Let's go.

26:19.892 --> 26:21.951
Steve, l have someone
l want you to meet.

26:22.127 --> 26:24.220
ls this the flying cannonball?

26:24.396 --> 26:27.456
This is Dan Rubin. Dan Rubin, this is
Steve Sanders and Celeste Lundy.

26:27.633 --> 26:28.998
- Hi.
- l can't believe it.

26:29.167 --> 26:32.193
The Walshes have been married
for 20 years. Think about it, 20 years.

26:32.371 --> 26:35.204
- That's gotta be a Beverly Hills record.
- lt's romantic.

26:35.374 --> 26:37.239
lf you believe in marriage.

26:38.176 --> 26:39.200
What, you don't?

26:40.946 --> 26:43.005
Ask me in about five years.

26:45.017 --> 26:47.110
- Nice meeting you.
- Bye.

26:53.692 --> 26:55.922
Hey, Red.

26:56.094 --> 26:59.029
Well, fancy meeting you here.

26:59.965 --> 27:01.762
Why do you always look so good?

27:01.934 --> 27:05.062
- To torture you.
- Consider me tortured.

27:05.804 --> 27:07.362
So, what did you get the Walshes?

27:08.106 --> 27:09.664
Candlesticks.

27:09.841 --> 27:13.038
Oh, really?
No pearl-handled revolvers?

27:14.046 --> 27:17.243
Kel, you don't have to worry about me.
No more guns.

27:17.416 --> 27:19.782
- That's a relief.
- You were right.

27:19.952 --> 27:24.787
l mean, being armed and dangerous
is not gonna solve all my problems.

27:25.290 --> 27:26.985
Well, l'm glad
to hear you say that, Dylan.

27:30.128 --> 27:33.962
Do you think anybody would get the
wrong idea if we walked in together?

27:34.566 --> 27:35.590
Who cares?

27:39.438 --> 27:42.134
This must be the present that
Brenda and Brandon got their parents.

27:42.307 --> 27:45.105
- Yeah, l know all about it.
- Look how cute they look.

27:45.277 --> 27:47.211
They haven't changed much
in 20 years.

27:47.379 --> 27:49.973
l wonder where we'll be in 20 years.

27:50.148 --> 27:52.514
l don't know where l'll be
in 20 minutes.

27:52.684 --> 27:54.652
Hello. Hi.

27:54.820 --> 27:56.378
Erin? What's Erin doing here?

27:56.555 --> 28:00.855
- Erin is here?
- Mel had some babysitter problems.

28:01.960 --> 28:03.120
Of course he did.

28:03.295 --> 28:06.093
Come here, sweetie.
Mommy's gonna take you to a party.

28:06.264 --> 28:07.754
- No.
- Yes, she is.

28:07.933 --> 28:09.332
- No.
- Yes, she is.

28:09.501 --> 28:11.628
No.

28:36.294 --> 28:37.784
Looks like Brenda
finally found someone

28:37.963 --> 28:39.555
who can keep up with her
on the floor.

28:43.201 --> 28:46.500
Stuart. A real mover-shaker,
always has been.

28:46.671 --> 28:49.469
How do you know him anyway, man?
He go to West Beverly?

28:49.641 --> 28:51.268
No, just from the scene.

28:51.443 --> 28:52.637
And what scene is that?

28:53.378 --> 28:54.709
You don't wanna know.

28:56.214 --> 28:57.306
So they serious?

28:58.116 --> 29:00.016
l don't know,
they spend a lot of time together.

29:00.752 --> 29:04.347
l'd keep my eye on him, bro.
l wouldn't want him dating my sister.

29:08.894 --> 29:10.225
Look at your parents.

29:11.029 --> 29:13.224
They really love each other,
don't they?

29:13.398 --> 29:14.524
Yeah, they do.

29:16.101 --> 29:18.865
You know, whenever l'm over here,
l feel like this is a real home.

29:19.037 --> 29:21.062
A real family.

29:21.239 --> 29:22.831
Not like the show my parents put on.

29:23.008 --> 29:25.203
Well, your parents seem like
they're pretty happy.

29:25.377 --> 29:27.277
lt's a business arrangement.

29:27.446 --> 29:29.437
They gave up on romance
a long time ago.

29:29.614 --> 29:31.081
That's too bad.

29:31.917 --> 29:33.509
l believe in love.

29:34.286 --> 29:35.878
Me too.

29:41.660 --> 29:42.684
All right.

29:45.030 --> 29:47.260
Well, if no one else is,
l'm gonna make the first toast.

29:47.432 --> 29:49.400
- What?
- Don't worry, l won't embarrass you.

29:49.568 --> 29:52.002
l wanna congratulate your parents.
Tell them how l feel. Come.

29:52.170 --> 29:53.194
- Oh, be nice.
- Come on.

29:53.371 --> 29:54.963
Be...

30:00.278 --> 30:02.178
Hi, everybody,
can l have your attention, please?

30:02.347 --> 30:04.110
Oh, l miss you.

30:04.282 --> 30:05.977
l'm Stuart Carson.

30:06.151 --> 30:07.641
l'm a friend of Brenda's.

30:07.819 --> 30:09.719
And even though
l've probably known the Walshes

30:09.888 --> 30:12.755
for less time than everyone here,

30:12.924 --> 30:16.758
l can't tell you how much it means
to me to be with you all tonight

30:16.928 --> 30:19.795
as we celebrate the love
of two very wonderful people.

30:19.965 --> 30:24.299
So please, raise your glasses with me
to Jim and Cindy Walsh.

30:24.469 --> 30:28.496
Let me be the first to congratulate you
on 20 years of marriage

30:28.673 --> 30:31.540
and a lifetime of happiness to come.

30:34.613 --> 30:36.444
Hear, hear.

30:36.615 --> 30:38.048
Hear, hear.

30:39.217 --> 30:41.344
Thanks.

30:47.192 --> 30:49.456
- That was very sweet. Thank you.
- That was lovely.

30:49.628 --> 30:52.825
- That was just lovely.
- Thank you , that was really nice.

30:52.998 --> 30:57.435
That is quite a guy Brenda's got.

30:57.602 --> 30:59.035
Who knows,

30:59.204 --> 31:02.298
maybe we'll all be seeing each other
at a wedding soon.

31:02.474 --> 31:05.136
Mother, please,
l'm having a great time tonight.

31:05.310 --> 31:06.538
Don't ruin it.

31:06.711 --> 31:09.236
Brenda is much too young
to be thinking about marriage.

31:09.414 --> 31:11.041
- Thank you, Mother.
- Oh, l don't know.

31:11.216 --> 31:16.244
He's rich, handsome, charming.
What more could she want?

31:16.421 --> 31:19.185
- College education.
- A college education.

31:19.357 --> 31:21.154
You were wonderful.

31:21.326 --> 31:23.920
See, l told you
l wouldn't embarrass you.

31:24.095 --> 31:27.292
Listen, can we go somewhere alone
for a minute?

31:27.465 --> 31:30.593
There's something
l want to say to you in private.

31:30.769 --> 31:32.828
Sure.

31:40.812 --> 31:43.508
ls this private enough for you?

31:43.682 --> 31:45.707
lt's perfect.

31:48.019 --> 31:51.079
Brenda,
l've never met anyone like you.

31:51.990 --> 31:54.550
You make me happier
than l have ever been in my life.

31:57.095 --> 32:02.192
And somehow, l thought tonight
might be a good time to give you this.

32:10.308 --> 32:13.573
- Stuart...
- l know this may seem fast.

32:14.112 --> 32:15.943
But l want to marry you, Brenda.

32:21.119 --> 32:23.246
l don't know what so say.

32:26.491 --> 32:28.322
Brenda,

32:29.194 --> 32:30.422
will you marry me?

32:34.666 --> 32:37.066
We've only known each other
for two weeks.

32:39.204 --> 32:40.535
Will you marry me?

32:46.711 --> 32:47.905
Yes.

32:48.647 --> 32:49.739
Yes.

33:03.361 --> 33:06.819
- Hey, Kel. Taking a breather?
- Yep, just fixing my face.

33:06.998 --> 33:09.091
Me too.

33:09.267 --> 33:11.497
So l like Dan.
He seems like a nice guy.

33:11.670 --> 33:12.796
Yeah, l guess he is.

33:13.405 --> 33:17.705
- l thought you really liked him.
- l thought so too.

33:17.876 --> 33:18.900
What's the matter?

33:21.279 --> 33:23.804
l slept with him, Kel.

33:24.849 --> 33:28.376
And the first time
was nothing like l thought it would be.

33:29.521 --> 33:31.318
Well, life never is.

33:31.489 --> 33:34.754
You wouldn't think that l'd be the kind
of girl to be so impulsive, would you?

33:35.994 --> 33:39.521
Andrea, sometime you're not supposed
to think things through so much.

33:39.698 --> 33:41.325
You just have to follow your heart.

33:42.334 --> 33:44.734
Well, that's just it.

33:44.903 --> 33:48.304
l mean, l thought
l might be in love with him, but...

33:49.741 --> 33:52.471
l don't know.
l mean, he's more cerebral than l am.

33:52.644 --> 33:55.340
He doesn't have
a romantic bone in his body.

33:56.214 --> 34:00.150
And tonight,
when l saw the Walshes together...

34:00.852 --> 34:02.717
l don't know, it just hit me.

34:02.887 --> 34:04.650
l mean,
maybe he's the wrong guy for me.

34:06.958 --> 34:09.483
How long is it supposed to take
before l feel the earth move?

34:10.395 --> 34:11.862
Just give it some time.

34:12.030 --> 34:13.621
What, practice makes perfect?

34:14.299 --> 34:16.460
Maybe.

34:16.634 --> 34:18.192
l don't know.

34:18.370 --> 34:20.838
lf you don't have sparks
in the beginning of a relationship,

34:21.005 --> 34:23.632
maybe there never will be any.

34:24.409 --> 34:27.310
Well, you never know.
l mean, look at Dylan and me.

34:27.478 --> 34:30.175
We have all the sparks in the world
and we still can't make it work.

34:37.422 --> 34:40.118
- Oh, here, let me take her.
- Thanks, l'm starved.

34:40.291 --> 34:42.315
Come here, sweetie.

34:42.494 --> 34:44.688
There you go.

34:44.862 --> 34:49.425
- David, l think she has a fever.
- No, it's just warm in here.

34:49.601 --> 34:51.534
No, she felt warm to me
when you first got here.

34:51.703 --> 34:53.193
But look, her face is flushed.

34:53.371 --> 34:55.998
- Did Mel say anything to you?
- No.

34:56.174 --> 34:58.699
Where's he? What's his number?
He did leave a number, didn't he?

34:58.877 --> 35:02.938
- Of course he did. lt's just...
- What?

35:03.415 --> 35:05.383
He's in Mexico.

35:05.550 --> 35:08.246
- What?
- Jackie, don't get all excited.

35:08.420 --> 35:10.854
l will get as excited
as l damn well please.

35:12.323 --> 35:14.848
Right now, l am going to take
my daughter home.

35:15.026 --> 35:18.462
You tell your father
he'll be hearing from my lawyer.

35:23.067 --> 35:25.297
You can tell
she is in a real great mood.

35:26.037 --> 35:28.028
Brenda, please say goodbye
to your parents for me.

35:28.206 --> 35:29.764
Erin's not feeling well.
l have to go.

35:29.941 --> 35:31.431
- Sure. Good night.
- Good night.

35:31.609 --> 35:33.270
Bye.

35:36.114 --> 35:38.708
Come on, let's find your parents
and tell them the good news.

35:38.883 --> 35:39.907
Oh, l don't know.

35:40.084 --> 35:41.779
l mean,
are you sure now is the right time?

35:41.953 --> 35:44.581
Are you kidding?
What better time? lt's perfect.

35:46.157 --> 35:48.318
Okay.

35:48.493 --> 35:50.927
- What?
- l know this is sudden,

35:51.095 --> 35:52.392
but we are in love.

35:53.932 --> 35:56.332
ln fact, l was hoping we could make
the announcement tonight.

35:56.868 --> 35:58.961
- Absolutely not.
- Why not?

35:59.137 --> 36:00.695
l mean,
aren't you guys happy for us?

36:00.872 --> 36:02.134
Of course we are.

36:02.307 --> 36:05.674
But maybe tonight
just isn't the best time to tell everyone.

36:05.844 --> 36:07.505
Tell everyone what?

36:07.679 --> 36:09.738
- Grandma.
- Oh, my God.

36:09.914 --> 36:11.040
Oh, my God.

36:12.984 --> 36:16.977
Oh, this is wonderful. l told you.

36:17.155 --> 36:19.555
- Didn't l tell you?
- Yes, you did, Mother.

36:19.724 --> 36:23.023
You make such a beautiful couple.
Come on.

36:23.194 --> 36:25.958
lt would make me very proud if you'd
let me make the announcement.

36:26.130 --> 36:28.360
- No, Mother, please.
- Oh, absolutely.

36:28.533 --> 36:29.693
Brenda.

36:29.868 --> 36:31.961
Brenda.

36:32.504 --> 36:34.335
- Jim, do something.
- lt's too late.

36:34.506 --> 36:35.837
Stop the music.

36:37.075 --> 36:38.838
Ladies and gentlemen,

36:39.611 --> 36:43.604
this is one of the happiest moments
of my life.

36:44.082 --> 36:46.312
Not only because we are celebrating

36:46.484 --> 36:51.285
my son and daughter-in-law's 20 years
of blissful matrimony.

36:51.756 --> 36:54.281
But because tonight,

36:54.459 --> 37:00.455
l have the honor
of announcing the engagement

37:00.632 --> 37:06.400
of my granddaughter Brenda Walsh
to Mr. Stuart Carson.

37:06.571 --> 37:08.630
- What?
- Don't look at me, bro.

37:08.806 --> 37:10.239
Wait a minute.

37:25.423 --> 37:28.950
- Brenda, you didn't tell us.
- l didn't know. He just asked.

37:29.127 --> 37:31.618
- But isn't it incredible?
- lncredible is not the word.

37:31.796 --> 37:34.458
- That ring is at least three carats.
- Three and a half.

37:35.934 --> 37:39.097
Looks like it was a little more serious
than you thought.

37:40.905 --> 37:42.873
- Did you know anything about this?
- Not a thing.

37:43.041 --> 37:45.066
Has your sister lost her mind?

37:45.243 --> 37:47.143
l don't know, Mom.
She's pulled some doozies

37:47.312 --> 37:48.939
but this one certainly takes the cake.

37:49.113 --> 37:50.705
Bren, are you sure about this?

37:50.882 --> 37:53.350
Oh, Donna, l'm in love.
What's the matter with that?

37:53.518 --> 37:55.884
Please, you guys,
please be happy for me.

37:56.054 --> 37:57.112
We are.

37:58.289 --> 37:59.313
You bet we are.

38:00.258 --> 38:02.123
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:02.293 --> 38:03.385
Cute. He is cute.

38:10.668 --> 38:14.434
- Hey, Dylan, how's it going?
- Stuart, so you do remember me.

38:14.606 --> 38:17.040
Yeah, of course, man.
lt's been a long time.

38:17.208 --> 38:18.539
Long enough, l hope.

38:19.744 --> 38:20.768
What does that mean?

38:20.945 --> 38:22.708
lt means
l hope you cleaned up your act.

38:23.848 --> 38:26.578
l have,
but why is that any of your business?

38:26.751 --> 38:30.551
Well, it's Brenda.
She's very important to me.

38:30.722 --> 38:34.453
l just wanna make sure you know
that if you ever hurt her in any way,

38:34.626 --> 38:36.651
you'll have to answer to me.

38:51.075 --> 38:54.238
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is time to cut the cake.

38:54.846 --> 38:55.870
Come on, everybody.

38:56.047 --> 38:58.811
- Let's go.
- Here we go.

39:04.455 --> 39:08.118
Speech. Speech.

39:11.462 --> 39:13.862
- Thank you.
- Thank you all for coming.

39:14.032 --> 39:17.763
lt's been an incredible evening.

39:17.935 --> 39:21.132
lt's been an incredible 20 years.

39:21.305 --> 39:25.503
l just hope the next 20
are as wonderful as the first.

39:30.281 --> 39:32.647
Cut the cake.

39:40.725 --> 39:42.317
Listen, l'll get us some cake.

39:42.493 --> 39:45.087
Why don't you go back and get us
some champagne, all right?

39:45.263 --> 39:47.128
Great.

39:57.842 --> 39:59.776
Hi, l'll have two glasses-- No.

39:59.944 --> 40:02.174
One glass of champagne, please,
and a glass of punch.

40:02.346 --> 40:03.904
Sure. Do you have some lD?

40:04.515 --> 40:06.779
- Excuse me?
- l'm only kidding.

40:08.052 --> 40:09.781
Good.

40:09.954 --> 40:12.616
lt looks like a great party.

40:12.790 --> 40:16.191
You know, my parents got engaged
at my grandparents' 20th anniversary.

40:16.360 --> 40:17.622
Or so they tell me.

40:17.795 --> 40:19.285
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:19.464 --> 40:22.524
Maybe that's what makes me
such a sucker for romance.

40:22.700 --> 40:24.759
l guess it's genetic.

40:24.936 --> 40:27.996
l cry at everything:
weddings, christenings,

40:28.172 --> 40:29.264
even television commercials.

40:29.440 --> 40:35.174
- So do l.
- Bar mitzvahs, Fourth of July...

40:36.581 --> 40:37.809
You've got a great smile.

40:40.318 --> 40:41.979
lt lights up your whole face.

40:43.121 --> 40:44.349
Thank you.

40:46.791 --> 40:49.817
- What's your name?
- Jesse.

40:51.562 --> 40:53.496
Hi, l'm Andrea.

40:55.566 --> 40:57.557
That's a beautiful name
for a beautiful girl.

40:59.170 --> 41:00.398
Thanks.

41:02.140 --> 41:03.164
These are yours.

41:08.946 --> 41:11.414
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

41:25.463 --> 41:28.455
l love you, Brenda Walsh,
soon-to-be Brenda Carson.

41:28.633 --> 41:29.759
Brenda Walsh-Carson.

41:30.902 --> 41:31.926
lsn't that what l said?

41:32.470 --> 41:34.097
l love you, Stuart.

41:35.473 --> 41:37.634
Excuse me, guys, could l cut in?

41:37.809 --> 41:39.572
- You? You never dance.
- Thanks.

41:39.744 --> 41:43.703
Well, l think in this case,
l might have to make an exception.

41:45.183 --> 41:49.119
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Not completely.

41:49.287 --> 41:50.515
But if feels awfully good.

41:50.688 --> 41:53.122
- So does cashmere, but you're allergic.
- Brandon--

41:53.291 --> 41:56.124
l just don't want you to do something
you're gonna regret, that's all.

41:56.627 --> 41:58.288
l won't. l promise.

41:58.896 --> 42:02.593
- Okay. l'm gonna hold you to that.
- Okay.

42:20.318 --> 42:22.183
Well, great party, kids.

42:22.353 --> 42:24.787
- Oh, thanks.
- Great party.

42:24.956 --> 42:26.890
Your grandmother and grandfather
are in your room.

42:27.058 --> 42:30.653
- lf you go in there, be quiet, will you?
- Okay. Good night.

42:30.828 --> 42:33.319
Oh, wow, l'm beat,
so l'm gonna go to bed.

42:33.497 --> 42:35.488
Trying to make a quick getaway?

42:36.934 --> 42:39.960
- Mom, Dad--
- Honey, just go to sleep.

42:40.137 --> 42:41.331
We'll talk in the morning.

42:42.073 --> 42:44.166
- l bet you will.
- Brandon.

42:46.410 --> 42:52.713
You know, l wonder what would
happen if l took out just one piece.

42:59.857 --> 43:04.055
Well, at least it'll give us
something to do tomorrow.

43:05.229 --> 43:06.457
Good night, Brandon.

43:14.338 --> 43:16.533
What a night.

43:18.743 --> 43:22.406
How serious do you think this thing
with Mr. Carson and our daughter is?

43:22.580 --> 43:24.070
Well, l know one thing:

43:24.248 --> 43:26.682
That's a pretty serious
engagement ring.

43:26.851 --> 43:29.012
You don't think that's what
made Brenda say yes, do you?

43:29.186 --> 43:30.710
Oh, no, no, no, l don't think so.

43:30.888 --> 43:35.120
