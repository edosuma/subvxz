WEBVTT

00:06.086 --> 00:09.266
A lot of sadness here.

00:09.834 --> 00:11.872
People here didn't want them.

00:11.873 --> 00:14.575
They were, in life, unwanted brats.

00:14.576 --> 00:15.739
Did it scare the kids?

00:15.740 --> 00:18.098
Oh, yeah. They were frightened.

00:18.099 --> 00:22.128
There was something
I saw that scared me.

00:22.129 --> 00:24.706
You could see what looked
like a head peeking out.

00:24.707 --> 00:26.720
If you had a kid, would
you let them come here?

00:26.721 --> 00:28.376
Probably not.

00:28.377 --> 00:31.917
Things are really messed up.

00:34.516 --> 00:36.555
There's something down there.

00:36.556 --> 00:38.507
My name..

00:38.508 --> 00:40.609
Is Amy Allan.

00:40.610 --> 00:42.809
A lot of dead people are here.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.001
I see dead people.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.682
This is not good.

00:45.683 --> 00:47.751
I speak to dead people.

00:47.752 --> 00:49.463
He is very pissed off.

00:49.464 --> 00:51.000
And they speak to me.

00:51.001 --> 00:52.309
The house is angry.

00:52.310 --> 00:55.770
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:55.771 --> 00:57.577
He's killed people.

00:57.578 --> 00:59.030
I rely on my partner.

00:59.031 --> 01:00.304
I'm Steve Dischiavi.

01:00.305 --> 01:02.550
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

01:02.551 --> 01:03.940
He got shot at his house?

01:03.941 --> 01:06.919
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:06.920 --> 01:08.267
Aren't you terrified, being here?

01:08.268 --> 01:09.621
It's my job to reveal 'em.

01:09.622 --> 01:11.686
That sounds like something
out of The Exorcist.

01:11.687 --> 01:13.797
But Steve and I never speak..

01:13.798 --> 01:15.820
We never communicate
during an investigation..

01:15.821 --> 01:17.161
Until the very end..

01:17.162 --> 01:18.498
That's bad.

01:18.499 --> 01:20.586
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay..

01:20.587 --> 01:21.943
I'd like some answers.

01:21.944 --> 01:24.944
Or time to get out.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074

01:48.990 --> 01:52.060
Amy and I work independently
from one another.

01:52.061 --> 01:54.062
It's my job to sort fact from fiction

01:54.063 --> 01:57.652
with interviews, research,
and hard evidence.

02:05.307 --> 02:07.409
I received a call from
a woman named Rebecca

02:07.410 --> 02:10.877
who works at the Slocum House
Theatre in Vancouver, Washington.

02:10.878 --> 02:13.668
Apparently, there's some strange
things going on in the building.

02:13.669 --> 02:16.081
But her biggest concern is the kids.

02:16.082 --> 02:17.844
They come there to see a theater show,

02:17.845 --> 02:19.988
and apparently, she
thinks they're in danger.

02:19.989 --> 02:24.789
I'm gonna try to find
out what's going on.

02:46.635 --> 02:48.491
As I approach this location,

02:48.492 --> 02:52.061
before I even open and invite
the dead to communicate with me,

02:52.062 --> 02:57.042
I begin to get images
flashing through my mind.

03:04.631 --> 03:09.673
Before Amy enters, I remove anything
that could influence her investigation.

03:09.674 --> 03:12.708
This theater contains a lot of
information that could be leading.

03:12.709 --> 03:18.609
I take my time to remove everything so
the building is ready for tonight's walk.

03:58.734 --> 04:03.098
A lot of sadness here.
A lot of sadness here.

04:03.099 --> 04:06.295
Things are really messed up. Um..

04:06.296 --> 04:09.930
Uh, there's, like,
chil.. A lot of children.

04:09.931 --> 04:12.881
Every medium has something
that just creeps them out.

04:12.882 --> 04:15.135
And for me, it's dead children.

04:15.136 --> 04:16.742
Sometimes I try to tune them out,

04:16.743 --> 04:20.973
but there are just too many
in this place to avoid them.

04:20.974 --> 04:25.270
They're running around
and being happy and happy.

04:25.271 --> 04:28.275
Everything's fine and, uh..

04:28.276 --> 04:30.524
But it's not. It's really not.

04:30.525 --> 04:32.308
And it's all..

04:32.309 --> 04:35.369
Um, really messed up.

04:45.636 --> 04:49.199
The Slocum House is Vancouver's
oldest community theater.

04:49.200 --> 04:52.120
And after 20 years of being
the company's vice president,

04:52.121 --> 04:55.273
Rebecca's grown very concerned
about the safety of the children.

04:55.274 --> 05:01.174
So I'm going to meet with her and
see how Amy and I can help out.

05:02.976 --> 05:04.790
Why do you need me and Amy to come in?

05:04.791 --> 05:08.593
We've noticed that the
activity has increased recently.

05:08.594 --> 05:10.829
And, uh, mostly when the kids are here.

05:10.830 --> 05:13.208
And I think it's frightening the kids.

05:13.209 --> 05:15.889
We usually have two classes
of kids in the summertime,

05:15.890 --> 05:18.755
and this year we didn't
have any sign up at all.

05:18.756 --> 05:20.416
And I think they're just
frightened to be here.

05:20.417 --> 05:22.573
Uh, what kind of things are going on?

05:22.574 --> 05:27.861
We've had apparitions, um,
voices, um, things being moved.

05:27.862 --> 05:29.454
You know, a little bit of everything.

05:29.455 --> 05:31.719
Okay. Are you ever
frightened when you're here?

05:31.720 --> 05:33.640
Yeah.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.596
Why would you stay here?

05:35.597 --> 05:36.485
It's my job.

05:36.486 --> 05:37.453
Okay.

05:37.454 --> 05:38.721
But your concern is for the kids.

05:38.722 --> 05:40.285
Absolutely for the kids.

05:40.286 --> 05:42.514
It dramatically increases
when the kids are here.

05:42.515 --> 05:43.818
- Okay.
- That's my main concern.

05:43.819 --> 05:45.903
I want the children safe.

05:45.904 --> 05:47.824
Okay.

06:00.846 --> 06:03.560
There's a lot of kids here.

06:03.561 --> 06:05.603
I don't like that if they're dead.

06:05.604 --> 06:07.877
Mm-hmm. Like, how many kids?

06:07.878 --> 06:08.735
10 to 20 kids.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.112
And are they all from the same period?

06:10.113 --> 06:13.747
- Like, are they all interacting and..
- Yeah, yeah.

06:13.748 --> 06:19.076
They're just being loud and running
around, kind of torturing the adults here.

06:19.077 --> 06:22.497
They're just acting crazy.

06:36.516 --> 06:38.007
Uh, so, Rebecca, this is the theater?

06:38.008 --> 06:38.718
Yeah.

06:38.719 --> 06:40.001
Okay, what happens here?

06:40.002 --> 06:44.580
We were doing a show, and just as we
were going for a curtain call and bowing,

06:44.581 --> 06:47.142
there was a vase of
flowers on a bookshelf,

06:47.143 --> 06:51.442
and it flew off and landed center stage.

06:51.443 --> 06:52.468
But was anybody there?

06:52.469 --> 06:55.408
Nobody was there. We
were all up front bowing.

06:55.409 --> 06:57.162
So I guess the audience sees this.

06:57.163 --> 06:59.091
Yeah, the audience did see it.

06:59.092 --> 07:01.000
What else happens in this room?

07:01.001 --> 07:03.256
There was this one time
where the children were here,

07:03.257 --> 07:04.976
and we turn off all of the lights

07:04.977 --> 07:07.306
and they recite their lines
to make sure they know them.

07:07.307 --> 07:10.479
And as they were doing that,
they were looking on the stage,

07:10.480 --> 07:13.646
and there were lights
flying all over the place.

07:13.647 --> 07:14.938
And what did it look like to you?

07:14.939 --> 07:17.407
Actually, it looked.. Kind of
looked like fireflies or something.

07:17.408 --> 07:19.828
And it had nothing to do with
production lights or anything like that?

07:19.829 --> 07:21.535
No, no, no, it was totally dark in here.

07:21.536 --> 07:23.147
We turned all the lights off.

07:23.148 --> 07:24.295
Did it scare the kids?

07:24.296 --> 07:28.016
Oh, yeah. They were frightened.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.440
People here didn't want them.

07:36.441 --> 07:37.703
Their families didn't like 'em either.

07:37.704 --> 07:38.581
Mm-hmm.

07:38.582 --> 07:41.843
They were, in life, unwanted brats.

07:41.844 --> 07:44.125
They were..

07:44.126 --> 07:47.112
Spoiled or, like, rotten, rotten.

07:47.113 --> 07:49.122
Did they live here or
did they just come..

07:49.123 --> 07:52.783
I don't know. I don't know.

07:53.974 --> 07:58.654
I wonder why ** oh
and, there's bunk beds.

08:01.151 --> 08:03.431
Bunk beds.

08:14.075 --> 08:15.875
Oh.

08:16.496 --> 08:20.036
Why? Why would you do this?

08:20.409 --> 08:22.861
There's, like, six..

08:22.862 --> 08:24.348
Six of them.

08:24.349 --> 08:26.084
Six what?

08:26.085 --> 08:28.065
Girls.

08:30.191 --> 08:33.731
Things are really messed up.

08:47.128 --> 08:49.035
So, Rebecca, what happens down in here?

08:49.036 --> 08:50.810
Um, I've heard children laughing.

08:50.811 --> 08:53.281
- In the basement here?
- Yes, in the basement.

08:53.282 --> 08:55.480
- Were there any kids in the building?
- No, no.

08:55.481 --> 08:56.798
This was late at night.

08:56.799 --> 09:00.110
It.. It sounded like there was
two or three kids in the corner.

09:00.111 --> 09:03.255
And like they were playing a
game and laughing with each other.

09:03.256 --> 09:06.801
And I.. I looked. Of course,
there was nothing there.

09:06.802 --> 09:09.272
So is there anything else you
might have heard or seen down here?

09:09.273 --> 09:14.613
I was down here by myself and I saw
something shoot across in the back corner

09:14.614 --> 09:17.029
as if it were trying to
hide from me or something.

09:17.030 --> 09:20.130
It looked like a younger teenage girl.

09:20.131 --> 09:23.431
That's interesting. Okay.

09:29.602 --> 09:32.715
I hear someone running.

09:32.716 --> 09:36.616
A girl running down this hallway.

09:37.924 --> 09:43.824
There's a young girl, uh, and
she's yelling at another girl.

09:44.925 --> 09:46.728
They're teenagers.

09:46.729 --> 09:52.629
She wants her to leave her
alone, and she's a stupid [Beep].

09:53.082 --> 09:54.545
There's, like, three s..

09:54.546 --> 09:57.066
Three sisters.

09:57.125 --> 10:00.108
There's one in particular, um..

10:00.109 --> 10:05.200
And she's probably, like, 18 or
something, and blonde hair, brown eyes.

10:05.201 --> 10:08.141
She's, like, 5'2..

10:09.229 --> 10:12.529
And she's crying a lot.

10:20.615 --> 10:23.971
What can you tell me about the house
that could help me in my investigation?

10:23.972 --> 10:27.099
This is not the original
location of the house.

10:27.100 --> 10:30.948
The house was actually located about
a block over and down a little bit.

10:30.949 --> 10:33.785
And we had it moved here in 1966.

10:33.786 --> 10:35.213
So we're really close to where it was.

10:35.214 --> 10:36.631
Exactly, yeah.

10:36.632 --> 10:38.016
What about this basement?

10:38.017 --> 10:39.800
At the old site, there was no basement.

10:39.801 --> 10:41.948
This we did.

10:41.949 --> 10:45.249
This was all underground.

10:51.848 --> 10:55.148
Well, I guess.. Do this.

11:00.392 --> 11:02.552
Oh, uh..

11:02.819 --> 11:04.844
I don't like it.

11:04.845 --> 11:06.194
What's wrong?

11:06.195 --> 11:10.695
I don't know. I don't like it in here.

11:12.633 --> 11:17.373
I, like, felt like I
walked through a wall.

11:18.299 --> 11:19.670
Oh.

11:19.671 --> 11:23.691
And then I got scared, because I..

11:28.036 --> 11:32.596
There was something
I saw that scared me.

11:33.662 --> 11:36.834
Someone here hates children.

11:36.835 --> 11:39.115
Hates 'em.

11:53.372 --> 11:56.753
There was something I saw..

11:56.754 --> 11:59.394
That scared me.

12:02.041 --> 12:03.626
And it went down.

12:03.627 --> 12:07.202
It got sucked into the ground.

12:07.203 --> 12:10.396
It was a big guy, I think. A big guy.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.666
Yeah, uh..

12:12.667 --> 12:18.067
I don't like him, and that
kind of made me nervous.

12:28.741 --> 12:31.610
So the guy went in the..

12:31.611 --> 12:34.311
Into the floor..

12:36.727 --> 12:39.279
Uh, over in here.

12:39.280 --> 12:43.792
And he's running because he
doesn't want to be bothered.

12:43.793 --> 12:47.393
He is kinda scary, this guy.

12:51.417 --> 12:52.899
He's like 7 feet tall.

12:52.900 --> 12:55.988
He's huge, and he's,
like, really broad..

12:55.989 --> 12:58.809
A big, broad guy.

13:06.788 --> 13:08.318
Kim, thanks for meeting with me.

13:08.319 --> 13:09.883
Uh, I spoke with Rebecca.

13:09.884 --> 13:13.345
Uh, she told me what was going on
and some of the concerns she has.

13:13.346 --> 13:15.712
Have you experienced
anything or seen anything?

13:15.713 --> 13:20.578
Yeah, um, mostly, I don't like
coming down to the basement by myself,

13:20.579 --> 13:24.555
because it just makes me
feel really nervous down here.

13:24.556 --> 13:28.636
I was closing, uh, the cellar door,

13:29.875 --> 13:35.775
and a man, very distinctly, in a
brown suit, short cut, steel-gray hair,

13:36.902 --> 13:40.675
kind of stocky, walking
directly under there,

13:40.676 --> 13:42.588
and I said, "hey, what are you doing?"

13:42.589 --> 13:45.075
Because I thought it was
somebody downstairs taking a tour.

13:45.076 --> 13:48.379
And I looked around, and
there was nobody down here.

13:48.380 --> 13:50.981
Anything else that you've
seen in the basement?

13:50.982 --> 13:55.907
There's a.. A.. An old air vent
that's, um, right in the ceiling here.

13:55.908 --> 13:58.004
And I cover it with a piece of paper

13:58.005 --> 14:01.312
when I'm doing a show
because it makes me nervous.

14:01.313 --> 14:06.824
It feels like, you know,
things kind of seep up into it

14:06.825 --> 14:09.969
and mess with my lights.

14:09.970 --> 14:15.870
Th.. Things don't work properly
when, you know, when I'm up there.

14:34.259 --> 14:37.559
This big guy, you know..

14:38.489 --> 14:42.463
And, you know, if there's a sensitive,
occasionally, they're gonna see him.

14:42.464 --> 14:45.922
And he, uh, he was probably like 5'7..

14:45.923 --> 14:49.720
But he was a pretty.. Pretty stocky guy.

14:49.721 --> 14:54.337
In death, entities can project
themselves the way they want to be seen.

14:54.338 --> 14:56.544
The 7-foot man I
encountered in the basement

14:56.545 --> 15:00.505
was really only 5'7 when he was alive.

15:00.506 --> 15:03.866
He doesn't like children.

15:04.970 --> 15:08.150
He might be aggressive.

15:08.994 --> 15:13.014
And he, like, shakes 'em sometimes.

15:19.636 --> 15:22.118
There's a really
uncomfortable feeling up here.

15:22.119 --> 15:24.971
The men's costume room right behind you,

15:24.972 --> 15:27.863
I always feel like there's a man
in there or there's a male presence.

15:27.864 --> 15:30.753
It's.. It's.. I just feel
like I'm being followed.

15:30.754 --> 15:32.351
Did you ever experience anything?

15:32.352 --> 15:37.121
Yes, one time during a show, um, we
could hear what sounded like kids running,

15:37.122 --> 15:40.866
um, things getting knocked
over, shoes dropping.

15:40.867 --> 15:45.147
So we came up to investigate and
we didn't see anybody up here,

15:45.148 --> 15:48.760
but the two other people I was
with, um, were looking down the hall,

15:48.761 --> 15:52.570
and they could see what looked
like a head, you know, peeking out.

15:52.571 --> 15:53.776
Kim, I don't understand.
You're.. You're..

15:53.777 --> 15:55.245
- Uncomfortable in the basement.
- Right.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.965
- You're uncomfortable
up here. - Mm-hmm.

15:56.966 --> 15:58.939
There's things going
on in the theater level.

15:58.940 --> 16:00.278
Why would you stay here?

16:00.279 --> 16:03.044
I.. I come here because I
like doing what I'm doing.

16:03.045 --> 16:08.945
And it's one of those pride things,
you're not gonna let it beat you.

16:11.096 --> 16:13.144
I'm getting really mad.

16:13.145 --> 16:13.945
You're getting what?

16:13.946 --> 16:16.302
- Angry.
- Why?

16:16.303 --> 16:20.623
Because they're not being clear about..

16:23.068 --> 16:25.708
What they want.

16:33.533 --> 16:35.884
Shaun, I understand you were the
stage manager here at some point.

16:35.885 --> 16:36.881
That's correct.

16:36.882 --> 16:38.472
Let me ask you a question
about Rebecca and Kim.

16:38.473 --> 16:41.774
I mean, are.. Are they legit?
They crazy? What's the story?

16:41.775 --> 16:44.234
Nothing about them, to
me, would seem crazy.

16:44.235 --> 16:45.452
Okay.

16:45.453 --> 16:49.520
Do you, uh, know, if, uh, when kids
have been present, has anything happened

16:49.521 --> 16:50.353
once the kids are here?

16:50.354 --> 16:53.169
When the kids are here, it
definitely wakes the house up.

16:53.170 --> 16:54.713
Did you have anything happen here?

16:54.714 --> 17:00.614
I will hear my name being called, usually
from this point, from the greenroom.

17:01.507 --> 17:03.010
It won't be like a, "hey, Shaun. "

17:03.011 --> 17:05.310
- It'll be..
- "Hey, Shaun. "

17:05.311 --> 17:08.612
And there's nobody here.

17:08.817 --> 17:10.095
What else happened?

17:10.096 --> 17:13.726
I've seen a man in the
men's dressing room.

17:13.727 --> 17:17.472
He's standing in the
window, almost to greet you.

17:17.473 --> 17:19.035
- Shaun, if you had
a kid.. - Mm-hmm.

17:19.036 --> 17:21.239
A young kid, would
you let them come here?

17:21.240 --> 17:23.700
Probably not.

17:25.771 --> 17:28.131
It's an old man.

17:28.132 --> 17:30.772
Ooh. He's old.

17:31.194 --> 17:36.993
And he, uh, is tired of children,
because he thought they were rotten.

17:36.994 --> 17:40.088
All I know is that old
man didn't like 'em.

17:40.089 --> 17:42.853
He initially liked children.

17:42.854 --> 17:46.070
And then he grew to hate them.

17:46.071 --> 17:47.748
There's some mental illness here.

17:47.749 --> 17:48.832
Yeah, crazy.

17:48.833 --> 17:50.424
"Crazy" in big letters.

17:50.425 --> 17:51.860
- What does that mean?
- It's just "crazy"

17:51.861 --> 17:53.403
in big letters. That's what I see.

17:53.404 --> 17:54.275
"Crazy. "

17:54.276 --> 17:56.150
Where do you see that?

17:56.151 --> 17:58.587
Like, just words written on a plaque.

17:58.588 --> 18:00.688
"Crazy. "

18:11.853 --> 18:13.543
There's some mental illness here.

18:13.544 --> 18:14.816
Yeah, crazy.

18:14.817 --> 18:17.250
"Crazy" in big letters.

18:17.251 --> 18:19.351
"Crazy. "

18:23.778 --> 18:26.563
There are plenty of crazy
sightings at the Slocum Theatre.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.808
But before I start
digging into its past,

18:28.809 --> 18:31.756
I want to make sure there's nothing
structurally wrong with the house.

18:31.757 --> 18:34.321
That might cause things
to just move on their own.

18:34.322 --> 18:36.551
It's a long shot, but I've
called in a building inspector

18:36.552 --> 18:40.332
to give the house a once-over.

18:40.967 --> 18:42.540
Kurt, thanks for coming out to meet me.

18:42.541 --> 18:43.554
Absolutely.

18:43.555 --> 18:46.815
There's claims of objects moving
from one side of a room to another,

18:46.816 --> 18:49.422
stuff falling off shelves for no reason.

18:49.423 --> 18:51.624
What I need to find out,
and I know it's a long shot,

18:51.625 --> 18:54.605
is if there's anything structurally
in this house that would cause that.

18:54.606 --> 18:57.556
For something to move
all the way across a room,

18:57.557 --> 18:59.680
we'd have to have
something pretty dramatic.

18:59.681 --> 19:05.321
I would think we'd be able
to find that if it's here.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.735
With over 20 years on
the police Department,

19:13.736 --> 19:15.943
I know that you have to
rule out the obvious first.

19:15.944 --> 19:18.859
Since the house was moved,
I'm hoping that'll explain

19:18.860 --> 19:23.000
why things have been shifting around.

19:35.744 --> 19:37.383
So, Kurt, what did you find out?

19:37.384 --> 19:43.284
Well, I didn't find anything that would
justify the items falling off shelves

19:43.477 --> 19:45.854
or being moved from one
side of the room to another.

19:45.855 --> 19:50.809
We have some slight areas of
unevenness that are not level,

19:50.810 --> 19:52.601
but nothing like you're describing.

19:52.602 --> 19:54.042
So there's nothing extreme here.

19:54.043 --> 19:56.683
Nothing extreme.

19:58.156 --> 20:00.922
Now that I know the Slocum
Theatre is structurally sound,

20:00.923 --> 20:03.843
I've gotta start digging
into who lived and died here.

20:03.844 --> 20:09.744
So I'm going to speak with a local
writer who knows this town inside and out.

20:14.687 --> 20:16.335
Jeff, thanks for taking
the time to meet with me.

20:16.336 --> 20:17.671
I appreciate it.

20:17.672 --> 20:20.609
Uh, I know you've written
several books, uh, about

20:20.610 --> 20:22.186
the Vancouver, Washington, area.

20:22.187 --> 20:24.853
My interest is in the
Slocum House Theatre.

20:24.854 --> 20:27.028
I was wondering if you
could help me out with that.

20:27.029 --> 20:32.458
The Slocum House was built by Charles
and Laura Slocum in the late 1870s.

20:32.459 --> 20:35.260
You know, you can tell, they're
obviously well-to-do people,

20:35.261 --> 20:36.905
and I can imagine them,
when they first got married,

20:36.906 --> 20:40.934
being really, really happy together,
buying that big, huge house lot,

20:40.935 --> 20:43.832
and then ten years later,
starting to build their dream house

20:43.833 --> 20:46.934
for a whole bunch of kids
and cousins and things.

20:46.935 --> 20:49.784
And yet, as life went on,
they didn't have any children.

20:49.785 --> 20:51.991
Obviously, the house is
built for a large family.

20:51.992 --> 20:53.073
It.. It was.

20:53.074 --> 20:57.846
And.. And Charles was gone a lot,
and so she was really kind of stuck,

20:57.847 --> 21:01.352
and she more or less adopted all the
neighborhood children as surrogates.

21:01.353 --> 21:03.672
So there would be birthday
parties all the time,

21:03.673 --> 21:05.819
and little plays for the children,

21:05.820 --> 21:11.720
and.. And I think any occasion she could
find, she would bring the children in.

21:14.718 --> 21:18.018
This one lady, she was..

21:18.641 --> 21:21.126
She was trapped, um,
and didn't like her life,

21:21.127 --> 21:26.129
and, uh, uh, there's like
chil.. A lot of children.

21:26.130 --> 21:29.137
I don't know if they're
dead unwanted brats.

21:29.138 --> 21:31.070
I'm hoping they're just residual.

21:31.071 --> 21:34.145
Aren't the kids a part
of this family here?

21:34.146 --> 21:34.904
Nope.

21:34.905 --> 21:36.109
They come from somewhere else?

21:36.110 --> 21:38.030
Yeah.

21:41.147 --> 21:43.175
Do you know what the reason was
why they didn't have any kids?

21:43.176 --> 21:45.739
No, I honestly don't know, but
they both started a little late.

21:45.740 --> 21:48.012
He was almost 30, and
she was in her mid 20s,

21:48.013 --> 21:50.293
which, for back then,
that was pretty old.

21:50.294 --> 21:51.083
Right.

21:51.084 --> 21:53.119
Uh, but Charles was away a lot.

21:53.120 --> 21:59.020
I mean, he had business interests all
the way into Idaho, places like that.

22:03.066 --> 22:08.300
This man, he just wants to be
away, and so he goes away a lot.

22:08.301 --> 22:13.941
He's unhappy that, uh, this
is how his life turned out.

22:19.731 --> 22:22.016
Now what I need to do is dig
into the property's history

22:22.017 --> 22:24.691
before the Slocums were there.

22:24.692 --> 22:27.127
I'm headed over to the Clark
County historical museum.

22:27.128 --> 22:32.108
Hopefully, I'm gonna get
some leads over there.

22:32.465 --> 22:38.099
In a case that dates back to the
1800s, it's hard to find solid evidence.

22:38.100 --> 22:41.722
But I'm able to uncover
two pieces of info.

22:41.723 --> 22:46.576
A guy named Amos Short once owned
the land where the theater sits.

22:46.577 --> 22:52.477
And he was involved in a bloody
land dispute resulting in two deaths.

22:57.516 --> 23:00.902
They're putting bags on dead people.

23:00.903 --> 23:03.789
And there's all these bugs.

23:03.790 --> 23:08.770
And it smells because
their bodies were rotting.

23:09.428 --> 23:12.668
It was just really bad.

23:30.253 --> 23:33.587
They're putting bags on dead people.

23:33.588 --> 23:34.785
And, uh..

23:34.786 --> 23:37.627
And there's all these bugs.

23:37.628 --> 23:42.608
And it smells because
their bodies were rotting.

23:46.740 --> 23:49.386
I finally got some solid
leads at the library.

23:49.387 --> 23:53.064
It turns out that a man named Amos
Short had a legal claim to the property

23:53.065 --> 23:55.134
that the Slocum Theatre sits on.

23:55.135 --> 23:59.353
Some land developer called
Hudson's Bay Company wanted him off.

23:59.354 --> 24:04.189
Apparently, Amos wasn't having
it, and he shot two of their guys.

24:04.190 --> 24:05.921
Now I have to meet
with a local historian

24:05.922 --> 24:10.542
to find out what led
up to that incident.

24:18.982 --> 24:22.604
I found out about Amos and Esther
Short, that lived on the property where

24:22.605 --> 24:24.344
the Slocum House Theatre is.

24:24.345 --> 24:25.086
Mm-hmm.

24:25.087 --> 24:27.952
What do you know about
Amos and Esther Short?

24:27.953 --> 24:30.276
Well, Amos and Esther
Short came out on..

24:30.277 --> 24:33.277
On the Oregon trail.

24:34.209 --> 24:37.383
They eventually had, I
think it was 12 children.

24:37.384 --> 24:41.957
And they filed a land claim, uh,
where that house is located now,

24:41.958 --> 24:47.121
but there were competing, uh, individuals
and organizations for that land.

24:47.122 --> 24:51.267
The Hudson's Bay Company was here,
and they wanted the Shorts to leave.

24:51.268 --> 24:54.491
And when he was gone,
Esther was harassed.

24:54.492 --> 24:57.081
It was an individual, Dr. Gardner,

24:57.082 --> 24:59.967
and a Hawaiian gentleman
from the Hudson's Bay Company.

24:59.968 --> 25:02.258
They harassed her on a regular basis.

25:02.259 --> 25:04.494
Uh, destroyed their agricultural fields,

25:04.495 --> 25:06.392
and they burned her
cabin down three times.

25:06.393 --> 25:11.019
I mean, there was a
lot of harassment here.

25:11.020 --> 25:16.920
There was someone here who was a Doctor
at some point, and this educated man

25:17.311 --> 25:20.251
did not like women.

25:21.089 --> 25:24.449
Didn't like them at all.

25:27.380 --> 25:30.844
Gardner and his assistant,
uh, come on to the property.

25:30.845 --> 25:35.630
They have a confrontation with Amos,
and then he gives 'em a verbal warning,

25:35.631 --> 25:37.269
asking them to leave.

25:37.270 --> 25:39.496
And then the shooting happens.

25:39.497 --> 25:40.958
And he winds up killing both of them.

25:40.959 --> 25:45.388
Right, right, and.. And he's
acquitted of self-defense.

25:45.389 --> 25:48.962
So Amos Short killed the two men who
tried to run him off his own land.

25:48.963 --> 25:53.196
But I need to know what happened
to Amos and his wife after that.

25:53.197 --> 25:55.931
So I managed to track down
a relative of Esther Short

25:55.932 --> 26:01.832
to see if she could provide me with
more details regarding this case.

26:07.777 --> 26:10.298
What's your relationship
to Esther Short?

26:10.299 --> 26:14.737
I'm about, uh, five generations
down from Esther Short.

26:14.738 --> 26:18.981
This is, uh, Esther when
she was a young woman.

26:18.982 --> 26:22.073
Now when Amos wasn't around, did
they try getting her off the land?

26:22.074 --> 26:22.790
Oh, yes.

26:22.791 --> 26:25.983
I don't know how many times
the Hudson Bay people, uh,

26:25.984 --> 26:28.091
put 'em on a raft and
sent 'em down the river.

26:28.092 --> 26:30.453
Probably three or four times.

26:30.454 --> 26:31.719
- The kids..
- The kids.

26:31.720 --> 26:34.795
- And her?
- So it was in the middle of the winter.

26:34.796 --> 26:37.896
One of those times, she was pregnant
when she was put on that raft.

26:37.897 --> 26:39.231
So these had to be pretty brutal men

26:39.232 --> 26:41.770
to do something like
that to her and ten kids.

26:41.771 --> 26:45.438
I mean, it was just
like they didn't exist.

26:45.439 --> 26:48.389
So Esther and Amos suffered
some serious hardships.

26:48.390 --> 26:49.104
Oh, yeah.

26:49.105 --> 26:52.690
Amos was just determined
he was gonna be here.

26:52.691 --> 26:56.722
But he went to, uh, San
Francisco with a load of potatoes,

26:56.723 --> 27:00.164
and then on his way back, the whole
ship went down, there were no survivors.

27:00.165 --> 27:01.014
Was it accidental?

27:01.015 --> 27:06.915
I do not know, but I suspect that had
something to do with the antagonism.

27:17.114 --> 27:20.506
There was a.. A big event.

27:20.507 --> 27:25.129
Someone's lost and people
are running all over.

27:25.130 --> 27:29.150
Inside the house, there's a panic.

27:32.458 --> 27:36.437
I feel like the person
who's lost is a male.

27:36.438 --> 27:42.338
Uh, they're scared because this male,
uh, they would be lost, uh, without him.

27:46.833 --> 27:49.404
Now what happened to
Esther after Amos died?

27:49.405 --> 27:52.144
She had to take care of her kids.

27:52.145 --> 27:54.626
She eventually ended up
having two different hotels.

27:54.627 --> 27:58.706
She ran those, and she did everything
she could to make it succeed.

27:58.707 --> 28:02.047
And I think she was tough
enough and strong enough

28:02.048 --> 28:03.928
that she was absolutely determined

28:03.929 --> 28:08.969
that she was gonna leave
a legacy for her kids.

28:19.415 --> 28:22.058
I came across several
dead people on my walk.

28:22.059 --> 28:25.724
But I decided to have a sketch
artist draw the most prominent one,

28:25.725 --> 28:28.485
the angry Doctor.

28:30.567 --> 28:32.982
There was a male.

28:32.983 --> 28:36.523
He had a heart-shaped face.

28:42.437 --> 28:45.200
Um, what can you tell me about his nose?

28:45.201 --> 28:47.361
It starts pretty high.

28:47.362 --> 28:50.782
The bridge is pretty high.

28:51.299 --> 28:54.891
Did it look sort of like that roughly?

28:54.892 --> 28:56.195
Proportion-wise and everything?

28:56.196 --> 28:58.560
I think his nose is a little thinner.

28:58.561 --> 28:59.369
A little thinner. Okay.

28:59.370 --> 29:01.290
Yeah.

29:02.249 --> 29:05.485
What can you tell me about his eyes?

29:05.486 --> 29:10.004
They're deep set and they're
a little bit far apart.

29:10.005 --> 29:12.041
And what can you tell
me about his hairdo?

29:12.042 --> 29:15.160
It came down pretty.. Pretty low.

29:15.161 --> 29:18.881
Then it's all slick.. Slicked.

29:24.080 --> 29:26.960
Sort of like that?

29:27.685 --> 29:29.545
Yes.

29:54.995 --> 29:57.257
Amy and I work
independently of one another.

29:57.258 --> 30:01.719
Tonight we'll be discussing
our findings for the first time.

30:01.720 --> 30:03.390
Well, guys, it's good to see you again.

30:03.391 --> 30:05.337
Uh, this is my partner.. Amy.

30:05.338 --> 30:06.316
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:06.317 --> 30:08.474
They run a theater show for the kids.

30:08.475 --> 30:09.754
Correct.

30:09.755 --> 30:13.270
Apparently, whenever
kids are in the theater,

30:13.271 --> 30:16.859
activity in the house
goes through the roof.

30:16.860 --> 30:18.115
And it's a big concern for them.

30:18.116 --> 30:20.726
They're worried about the kids
and to see if they're safe.

30:20.727 --> 30:22.775
So with that being said,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy

30:22.776 --> 30:26.754
and find out what happened on her walk.

30:26.755 --> 30:29.404
Well, it was really
interesting because I had, um,

30:29.405 --> 30:32.688
physical sensations that
were a little unusual.

30:32.689 --> 30:35.314
It felt like I was
walking through walls.

30:35.315 --> 30:41.215
And that was downstairs in the
entrance to the changing area, I guess.

30:42.017 --> 30:46.397
Like I hit the wall, and then it gave.

30:46.692 --> 30:49.812
Uh, I don't like it.

30:50.202 --> 30:52.722
What's wrong?

30:54.118 --> 30:58.078
And that kind of made me nervous.

31:01.603 --> 31:06.614
The interesting thing is that
there used to be a wall there.

31:06.615 --> 31:09.324
We have recently redone
that whole basement.

31:09.325 --> 31:13.845
And there was another room down there
that we actually got rid of completely.

31:13.846 --> 31:15.335
Oh, wow. Okay.

31:15.336 --> 31:19.861
The house was moved in 1966
from where it originally was.

31:19.862 --> 31:20.572
Mm-hmm.

31:20.573 --> 31:22.738
And it didn't have a
basement originally.

31:22.739 --> 31:23.621
No.

31:23.622 --> 31:25.605
So it was all dirt there.

31:25.606 --> 31:28.366
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:33.334 --> 31:39.234
I also began to feel um, a real sense
of despair and depression and loss.

31:42.067 --> 31:47.967
And then I met this younger
female who was feeling this way.

31:48.425 --> 31:54.325
And it seemed to have a lot
to do with her and her family.

31:54.979 --> 31:57.430
She was missing her husband.

31:57.431 --> 32:00.452
- He was always gone and traveling and..
- Hmm.

32:00.453 --> 32:03.800
I think she really,
really loved him a lot.

32:03.801 --> 32:07.951
I got a picture of, uh,
Charles and Laura Slocum.

32:07.952 --> 32:11.046
They met here in town. They got married.

32:11.047 --> 32:12.680
They built that house.

32:12.681 --> 32:16.253
Now obviously the house is big, and you
would think they built a house that big

32:16.254 --> 32:17.251
because they were gonna have kids.

32:17.252 --> 32:19.883
So they didn't have any kids.
We don't know really why.

32:19.884 --> 32:21.835
Interesting.

32:21.836 --> 32:27.736
A lot of sadness, very depressing,
like nobody was ever really happy here.

32:30.466 --> 32:33.642
He used to go away a lot on
business and then come back.

32:33.643 --> 32:36.935
She used to do a lot of events in the
house for the kids in the neighborhood.

32:36.936 --> 32:42.396
Apparently, uh, it filled
the void of not having kids.

32:45.822 --> 32:48.790
Once when I was in the theater,
um, I was sitting there,

32:48.791 --> 32:53.039
and this apparition of this
woman came walking past me.

32:53.040 --> 32:54.992
And she had long hair, and she..

32:54.993 --> 32:56.008
She didn't acknowledge me.

32:56.009 --> 32:59.518
She just kept walking right past.

32:59.519 --> 33:01.242
And you think it's her?

33:01.243 --> 33:04.843
I do. I do think it's her.

33:07.541 --> 33:09.728
So, Amy, what else did
you see on your walk?

33:09.729 --> 33:15.189
I came into contact with
residual imprints of children.

33:19.007 --> 33:23.900
People here didn't want
them because they were..

33:23.901 --> 33:24.891
Spoiled.

33:24.892 --> 33:28.912
They were, in life, unwanted brats.

33:30.348 --> 33:33.792
And there were at least ten of them.

33:33.793 --> 33:39.014
They were running, yelling
and screaming and jumping and..

33:39.015 --> 33:44.094
Any adult, they're like, on,
and, um, wanting attention, and..

33:44.095 --> 33:49.513
Yeah, it was kind of overwhelming, just,
like, how much, how loud, how active

33:49.514 --> 33:51.562
these kids were.

33:51.563 --> 33:54.242
We tend to hear noises,
especially when kids are present,

33:54.243 --> 34:00.143
and, uh, Shaun and Rebecca saw
what looked like a smaller head..

34:00.317 --> 34:01.367
Kind of peeking around.

34:01.368 --> 34:04.138
I just opened the door and said,
"okay, you guys, knock it off. "

34:04.139 --> 34:06.578
"We have a show. We need
you to stop making noise. "

34:06.579 --> 34:10.599
And, uh, yeah, nobody was upstairs.

34:16.781 --> 34:20.621
I also saw an elderly gentleman.

34:22.304 --> 34:24.272
He traveled all the time.

34:24.273 --> 34:27.108
Then I got the educated man.

34:27.109 --> 34:30.109
He hated women and..

34:30.661 --> 34:33.962
He didn't like children.

34:37.101 --> 34:39.492
You know, I went back a lot
further than the Slocums.

34:39.493 --> 34:44.306
Uh, the land that house sat
on was originally owned by, uh,

34:44.308 --> 34:46.038
Amos and Esther Short.

34:46.039 --> 34:48.676
Uh, it wasn't even U.S.
soil at the.. At the time.

34:48.677 --> 34:51.735
And they were in a battle
with the Hudson Bay Company.

34:51.735 --> 34:53.087
They didn't want them here.

34:53.088 --> 34:55.254
They claimed the land
here, that it was theirs.

34:55.255 --> 35:00.595
When Amos would go off on business,
Esther was left alone with the ten kids.

35:00.596 --> 35:03.948
Hudson Bay Company did everything
they could to get rid of her.

35:03.949 --> 35:05.601
They destroyed the crops.

35:05.602 --> 35:08.014
They burned their cabin three times.

35:08.015 --> 35:11.613
Even went as far as, two times,
putting her and the ten kids in a boat

35:11.614 --> 35:13.391
and sticking them on
the river with no oars.

35:13.392 --> 35:15.312
What?

35:17.821 --> 35:19.405
"Take care. "

35:19.406 --> 35:22.346
That's pretty sick.

35:26.352 --> 35:29.584
Shaun, tell Amy about the
guy you see in the window.

35:29.585 --> 35:32.150
I'm wondering if he could be
one of the three guys Amy saw.

35:32.151 --> 35:36.669
Every time I walk into the
side door of the theater,

35:36.670 --> 35:42.570
the men's costume room window, a
man is standing there watching me.

35:45.757 --> 35:47.481
And it's just this..

35:47.482 --> 35:50.662
Wyatt Earp-looking man.

35:54.022 --> 35:56.058
Amy, you sketched one of
the men you saw, right?

35:56.059 --> 35:58.999
Yes. Um, I sketched

35:59.356 --> 36:01.933
who I felt was the educated man.

36:01.934 --> 36:04.934
He hated women and..

36:05.886 --> 36:08.819
He didn't like children.

36:08.820 --> 36:13.920
You know what? Let's
take a look at the sketch.

36:27.477 --> 36:30.357
That's who I see.

36:38.435 --> 36:40.607
Amy, you sketched one of
the men you saw, right?

36:40.608 --> 36:42.505
- Yes, I did.
- Okay.

36:42.506 --> 36:47.246
I sketched who I felt
was the educated man.

36:54.122 --> 36:57.002
What do you think?

37:00.739 --> 37:02.599
Wow.

37:03.980 --> 37:05.900
Yeah.

37:14.980 --> 37:17.380
That's him.

37:18.082 --> 37:23.002
That's the man that
watches me in the window.

37:26.134 --> 37:29.914
Everything about it is spot-on.

37:30.018 --> 37:33.931
Oh, man, the hair is
just ridiculous. That's..

37:33.932 --> 37:35.251
That's it.

37:35.252 --> 37:37.381
The hair was very specific, so..

37:37.382 --> 37:38.474
Yeah.

37:38.475 --> 37:40.947
Well, there's a lot more to the story.

37:40.948 --> 37:46.848
Um, as far as Amos goes, at one point,
Amos was home, and.. Two men came again

37:50.582 --> 37:52.123
to try to get him off the property.

37:52.124 --> 37:52.940
Ahh.

37:52.941 --> 37:55.571
He told them, "don't come on my land"

37:55.572 --> 37:58.432
"or I'm gonna shoot. "

37:58.433 --> 38:01.525
Gave 'em a warning shot.

38:01.526 --> 38:03.191
They didn't listen.

38:03.192 --> 38:06.055
Two more shots, and he killed both men.

38:06.056 --> 38:08.270
And it happened right
outside the door of the house.

38:08.271 --> 38:09.957
- Oh, my gosh.
- Wow.

38:09.958 --> 38:12.983
Now both of them worked
for the Hudson Bay Company.

38:12.984 --> 38:18.884
One guy was named Dr. Gardner, and,
uh, his assistant, a Hawaiian guy.

38:19.467 --> 38:24.816
There was someone here who
was a Doctor at some point.

38:24.817 --> 38:27.280
He hates the girls,
like, the teenage girls.

38:27.281 --> 38:29.173
Just hates 'em.

38:29.174 --> 38:32.834
Hates 'em so much. Hates 'em.

38:32.839 --> 38:36.419
Unfortunately, there is no
photo of Dr. David Gardner.

38:36.420 --> 38:39.430
I don't know who this
educated man that I saw was,

38:39.431 --> 38:42.252
but I do know that he hated women.

38:42.253 --> 38:44.680
He died in 1850.

38:44.681 --> 38:46.804
Hardly anybody's picture
was taken back then.

38:46.805 --> 38:51.638
But it's obvious that you
and Amy saw the same guy.

38:51.639 --> 38:53.177
That's him.

38:53.178 --> 38:54.469
Yeah.

38:54.470 --> 38:59.861
A Doctor is obviously an educated
man, especially in the 1850s.

38:59.862 --> 39:02.502
Now, Amy, you said
this man hated children?

39:02.503 --> 39:04.963
Mm-hmm. Yes.

39:13.018 --> 39:15.267
Well, we many never know
if it's really Dr. Gardner

39:15.268 --> 39:17.086
who's scaring the children here.

39:17.087 --> 39:18.941
But the most pressing question is,

39:18.942 --> 39:24.282
is it safe for those kids
to come into the theater?

39:24.978 --> 39:30.078
That being said, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:31.768 --> 39:33.378
Well..

39:33.379 --> 39:36.619
In this case, there's..

39:38.387 --> 39:40.667
Good news.

39:40.684 --> 39:42.978
I feel it's safe for them.

39:42.979 --> 39:47.659
But I have a problem
with the 7-foot man.

39:48.818 --> 39:52.538
He.. Is kinda scary, this guy.

39:52.608 --> 39:54.303
And he's, like, really broad..

39:54.304 --> 39:57.124
A big, broad guy.

40:01.036 --> 40:03.770
So was he 7 feet tall, or was
he just presenting himself..

40:03.771 --> 40:04.963
- He was just presenting..
- Okay.

40:04.964 --> 40:07.183
- In life, he was, like, 5'7..
- Okay.

40:07.184 --> 40:10.431
But in death, he's 7 feet tall.

40:10.432 --> 40:14.813
I think he needs a stern talking
to because he is being a hypocrite.

40:14.814 --> 40:20.714
He is saying he wants to be left
alone, and yet, he's harassing.. People.

40:22.363 --> 40:25.543
So that needs to stop.

40:25.842 --> 40:30.070
I think you guys should talk about
what each of you has experienced,

40:30.071 --> 40:33.463
what you want, what you
don't want, write it all down,

40:33.464 --> 40:36.599
and then go down there as a group
and read out the whole thing.

40:36.600 --> 40:39.794
Be like, "that's your
space, you hang out there. "

40:39.795 --> 40:42.523
"We'll respect that if you respect us. "

40:42.524 --> 40:46.287
"If you don't respect us,
then you're gonna have to go. "

40:46.288 --> 40:49.338
I'm certain the 7-foot-man
was Dr. Gardner's assistant.

40:49.339 --> 40:55.159
He's chosen to stay in the
theater, but needs to move on.

40:57.402 --> 41:00.559
Amy, what do they do if, after
they have this talk with this guy,

41:00.560 --> 41:01.852
and it doesn't stop?

41:01.853 --> 41:04.196
Well, then you're going to
throw him out of the location.

41:04.197 --> 41:04.951
Okay.

41:04.952 --> 41:09.721
We'll keep in contact
to see how this goes.

41:09.722 --> 41:15.121
And if you have to make him leave,
then I'll tell you what you need to do.

41:15.122 --> 41:17.745
I mean, now that we know that
it's not dangerous for the kids..

41:17.746 --> 41:19.205
- Yeah.
- You know, I mean..

41:19.206 --> 41:21.452
It kinda goes to the
personality of the house.

41:21.453 --> 41:23.284
It would be, you know,
if he wants to stay

41:23.285 --> 41:25.955
and he's willing to follow the rules..

41:25.956 --> 41:27.207
We don't have any hostility.

41:27.208 --> 41:29.255
We just want kids to
feel comfortable coming..

41:29.256 --> 41:30.917
- So..
- Right. Right.

41:30.918 --> 41:34.698
- Mm-hmm. -
Thank you so much.

41:34.868 --> 41:38.281
There are several dead people
inhabiting the Slocum House,

41:38.282 --> 41:42.304
but only the 7-foot man
presents any sort of danger.

41:42.305 --> 41:46.104
As long as the employees of the theater
follow the advice I've given them,

41:46.105 --> 41:51.459
they have nothing to worry about,
and the children will remain safe.
