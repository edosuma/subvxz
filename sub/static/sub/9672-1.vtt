01:58.118 --> 01:59.703
I remembered a joke.

02:00.037 --> 02:01.538
It's funny.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.081
Okay.

02:03.081 --> 02:06.126
Seorg and his wife were having sex one night,

02:06.210 --> 02:08.920
when their young son suddenly enters the room.

02:09.045 --> 02:09.686
Hang on a sec.

02:09.711 --> 02:11.448
Are we going in the right direction?

02:12.216 --> 02:13.675
Olav!

02:15.594 --> 02:18.055
What are we looking for?

02:18.430 --> 02:20.432
Just keep going.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.936
A little bit more or else we will be flagged on the site.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.897
Okay.
Continue the joke.

02:28.315 --> 02:32.152
The boy gets scared and leaves running from the room, crying.

02:32.736 --> 02:34.129
The mother says, "Honey!

02:34.155 --> 02:35.722
Now, what should we do? "

02:35.822 --> 02:37.199
You know women...

02:37.324 --> 02:40.953
The father says: "Let me handle this".

02:43.330 --> 02:45.415
Then he leaves and goes to the child's bedroom

02:45.541 --> 02:46.959
to say he was joking.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.877
He opens the door and sees the small bastard

02:48.961 --> 02:52.840
is lying on top of his grandmother, having sex with her!

02:53.131 --> 02:56.760
Very animated too, rises and falls, up and down.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.221
Then he looks for the father and says:

02:59.304 --> 03:00.639
What's wrong, Dad?

03:00.764 --> 03:03.183
You play with mine so I play with her, right?

03:08.856 --> 03:10.232
Stop!

03:17.406 --> 03:18.866
Is it here?

03:23.412 --> 03:25.038
It's right here.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.772
Don't move!

04:02.534 --> 04:04.244
Turn on the light.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.550
Oh, my God!

05:30.122 --> 05:31.540
Kate!

05:31.623 --> 05:34.126
- Shit.
- Sorry, Kate.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.461
These fellas said that you've been expecting them?

05:36.587 --> 05:38.463
- Of course, thanks, Hanks.
- Thanks.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.928
Hey, uh...
you forgot, didn't you?

05:45.053 --> 05:47.556
No, no, I just...

05:48.515 --> 05:49.975
Yeah.

05:50.517 --> 05:53.395
He just wanted to...
Actually, this is him.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.315
I'm Dr. Sander Halvorson.

05:56.648 --> 05:58.108
Kate Lloyd.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.694
Yes.
Do you know who I am?

06:02.237 --> 06:03.655
I do.

06:04.323 --> 06:06.658
Adam told me a little bit about you as well.

06:06.742 --> 06:10.120
He said you specialized in vertebrate paleontology.

06:10.245 --> 06:11.747
Primarily, yes.

06:11.830 --> 06:15.042
And obviously you extracted specimens from pack ice.

06:15.125 --> 06:18.170
I've worked on several cold weather digs.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.172
Good.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.095
An old friend of mine, a colleague of Oslo,

06:27.179 --> 06:30.057
runs a geological research station in Antarctica.

06:30.140 --> 06:33.268
48 hours ago, his team found something

06:33.769 --> 06:35.437
quite remarkable.

06:35.938 --> 06:37.272
Really?

06:37.731 --> 06:39.066
What'd they find?

06:39.149 --> 06:42.402
We're flying down there tommorow evening to examine the site.

06:42.486 --> 06:44.821
And I need a paleontologist.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.742
Doctor, I'm sure you can understand that

06:48.825 --> 06:52.037
I need to know a little bit about what it is I'm being asked to dig up?

06:52.162 --> 06:53.664
There is a structure.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.457
A structure?

06:55.999 --> 06:58.252
- Yes.
- In Antarctica?

06:58.836 --> 07:00.504
And a specimen.

07:01.046 --> 07:03.006
That's all I can tell you.

07:03.549 --> 07:06.343
And I guess I don't have any time to think about this.

07:06.468 --> 07:07.402
No, I'm sorry.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.496
I need your answer right now.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.602
Well...

07:16.687 --> 07:18.146
I'm in.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.649
Great.

07:21.149 --> 07:24.027
Adam will get you the details of our departure.

07:26.321 --> 07:27.963
Right, I'll see you in the car.

07:27.989 --> 07:28.966
Yes, of course.

07:28.992 --> 07:29.708
Thank you.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.161
Adam.

07:35.706 --> 07:37.249
What the hell is it?

07:37.374 --> 07:39.793
You now officially know as much as I do.

07:39.877 --> 07:43.255
But I'll tell you one thing, I worked for that guy for three years

07:43.380 --> 07:46.133
and I've never seen him this excited.

08:22.921 --> 08:24.297
She US?

08:36.100 --> 08:37.559
Look at this guy.

08:39.979 --> 08:42.315
I mean, how is that even humanly possible?

08:54.452 --> 08:57.372
I was hoping maybe you could help me with something?

08:57.872 --> 09:02.544
I can't seem to get ahold of a newspaper three weeks old

09:02.669 --> 09:05.547
and I'm a man in desperate need for certain information.

09:05.672 --> 09:08.341
Carter, don't do this to yourself, man.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.969
And what information would that be?

09:11.177 --> 09:13.763
I want to know how the Cavaliers are going.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.267
I don't follow football.

09:18.351 --> 09:19.978
It's a basketball team.

09:20.687 --> 09:22.021
They play basketball.

09:22.146 --> 09:25.066
Barely.
They're the Cavaliers, man.

09:27.652 --> 09:28.901
Sorry, I couldn't help you.

09:28.927 --> 09:30.221
Nah, that's all right.

09:30.905 --> 09:33.867
Listen, just so you guys know, whatever y'all are doing,

09:33.950 --> 09:36.077
you might wanna wrap it up in a couple of days.

09:36.160 --> 09:37.537
Yeah, why's that?

09:37.620 --> 09:39.979
There's a storm moving in.

09:40.005 --> 09:41.274
A nasty one.

09:41.374 --> 09:42.973
Good morning, Griggs.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.444
Yeah, he's right.

09:44.502 --> 09:46.921
And the last place where you want to be

09:47.005 --> 09:50.341
is cooped up with a dozen Norwegian guys.

09:53.469 --> 09:54.846
Trust me.

10:02.061 --> 10:04.439
Base in sight of my 1 o'clock.

10:06.191 --> 10:09.004
<i>This is H3 Sea King inbound to Thule.</i>

10:09.030 --> 10:10.094
<i>Do you copy?</i>

10:11.029 --> 10:12.385
<i>Hello, H3 Sea King.</i>

10:12.411 --> 10:14.766
<i>Please, approach from the west.</i>

10:14.991 --> 10:16.701
<i>Landing pad is cleared</i>

10:30.173 --> 10:32.050
<i>Bravo, coming back.</i>

10:34.260 --> 10:36.387
Good to go, Griggs.

10:40.475 --> 10:42.310
- Dr. Halvorson?
- Yes?

10:43.102 --> 10:45.230
- Welcome to Thule.
- Thank you.

10:45.355 --> 10:48.691
Edvard asked you to go to the site, right now.

10:49.984 --> 10:51.778
Lars is going to drive you.

10:53.488 --> 10:54.989
- Hi.
- Hi. Welcome.

10:55.073 --> 10:56.991
<i>- Please go in the Spryte.
- Thanks.</i>

10:57.075 --> 10:58.368
Hello, sir.

11:56.467 --> 11:57.760
Watch your step.

12:03.308 --> 12:04.767
Brighten.

12:05.476 --> 12:06.769
Edvard!

12:08.771 --> 12:11.191
- You got it.
- Sure, I did.

12:14.694 --> 12:16.821
Yeah, this is Kate Lloyd.

12:17.989 --> 12:20.491
- Columbia paleontology.
- Welcome.

12:20.575 --> 12:22.493
Adam Finch, my research assistant.

12:22.577 --> 12:23.870
- Welcome.
- Hi.

12:23.995 --> 12:25.538
This is Edvard, my good friend.

12:25.622 --> 12:27.066
This is some of my team.

12:27.092 --> 12:28.236
Karl and Juliette.

12:28.262 --> 12:29.342
Both geologists.

12:29.375 --> 12:30.919
- Hi.
- Welcome.

12:32.086 --> 12:33.421
Okay.

12:34.880 --> 12:38.175
Let me show you why you flew 10,000 miles.

13:18.507 --> 13:20.050
Holy shit!

13:21.093 --> 13:24.972
We estimated this has been here approximately 100,000 years.

13:25.556 --> 13:28.642
We picked up a signal transmitting.

13:30.185 --> 13:32.479
Some kind of distress call, perhaps.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.773
Incredible.

13:34.898 --> 13:36.817
We think the signal was triggered

13:36.900 --> 13:40.153
when the survivor exited the craft.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.284
Survivor?

14:10.184 --> 14:11.602
My God.

14:28.285 --> 14:31.121
How long will it take to get it out, do you know, Kate?

14:34.208 --> 14:36.919
Assuming you've the right equipment, I'd say...

14:38.045 --> 14:39.713
maybe half a day.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.216
Good.

15:03.529 --> 15:07.199
The ice, should I ask you how fragile is it?

15:07.282 --> 15:09.159
It's not in a fracture zone.

15:09.243 --> 15:12.120
So there's very little risk of fissuring.

15:12.204 --> 15:13.956
And the ice is quite dense.

15:14.039 --> 15:16.667
So we think we can get it out in one piece.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.126
Good.

15:18.252 --> 15:21.296
I mean, rough estimates about 6 by 12 feet, 3 and a half feet high.

15:21.380 --> 15:23.757
- Probably some place right around...
- That's great...

15:23.841 --> 15:27.553
Make sure that everyone stays off the radio.

15:27.636 --> 15:29.763
I do not want any information out.

15:29.847 --> 15:32.975
And the crane... do we have something appropriate for this?

15:33.350 --> 15:34.828
Yes, it's already there.

15:34.854 --> 15:35.961
It's all set up.

15:36.061 --> 15:37.396
I'm Peder, by the way.

15:37.521 --> 15:39.356
- Peder.
- Nice to meet you.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.462
So, you've gotten it all taken care of.

15:41.488 --> 15:43.302
I don't think you really need me.

15:43.569 --> 15:44.477
What about him?

15:44.503 --> 15:46.680
He's secretly disinterested or...?

15:46.780 --> 15:48.073
Oh, that's Lars.

15:48.156 --> 15:50.951
He does not understand English, but he works like a bear.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.536
And, as you can see from the scans,

15:52.536 --> 15:55.873
the ship carved a 200 meter tunnel into the ice.

15:57.583 --> 15:59.257
So, let me get this right.

15:59.283 --> 16:01.278
You crashed into a glacier...

16:02.004 --> 16:03.755
And then without enough information

16:03.881 --> 16:06.383
you leave the cozy confines of your ship?

16:06.508 --> 16:10.512
Maybe he was hurt and wanted to find someplace warm.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.850
Well, I guess it didn't find it.

16:53.722 --> 16:56.141
The first night is hard.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.828
Sorry, I didn't mean to keep you up.

16:59.854 --> 17:01.838
No, no, it's fine.

17:06.318 --> 17:09.238
I'll never look at them the same again.

17:53.700 --> 17:55.618
What do you mean for transport weight?

17:55.743 --> 17:58.506
To cut it down to a portable weight,..

17:58.532 --> 18:01.524
..we have to take it from here to here.

18:03.459 --> 18:05.378
Start with 4 inches.

18:05.795 --> 18:07.755
I never believed in this shit.

18:08.631 --> 18:10.508
I always did.

18:12.177 --> 18:14.971
- We're all set?
- Nearly there.

18:15.096 --> 18:16.681
Good.

18:17.223 --> 18:18.725
Good.

18:21.394 --> 18:25.231
But before we do, I'm going to take a tissue sample.

18:28.484 --> 18:30.778
Do you really think that's a good idea?

18:31.905 --> 18:33.698
Yes, I do.

18:34.866 --> 18:36.993
I mean the conditions are so unpredictable

18:37.076 --> 18:39.078
and we don't have the proper equipment.

18:39.204 --> 18:40.872
Sterilization is an issue.

18:40.997 --> 18:44.667
Edvard, what do you have in the way of a small diameter drill?

18:44.792 --> 18:47.003
Up to 30mm.

18:47.504 --> 18:49.255
Very good.

18:49.631 --> 18:52.050
I think somewhere around here.

18:57.596 --> 19:00.390
Kate.
Just a second.

19:01.975 --> 19:05.979
In the future, don't contradict me in front of those people again.

19:06.104 --> 19:07.064
I just thought...

19:07.090 --> 19:08.840
You're not here to think.

19:08.941 --> 19:11.568
You're here to get that thing safe out of the ice.

19:13.153 --> 19:15.280
I hope we understand each other.

21:04.348 --> 21:06.808
So, have you ever tasted this before?

21:06.975 --> 21:09.019
- No, I haven't.
- It tastes very bad.

21:09.102 --> 21:11.605
Gentlemen.
Ladies.

21:11.939 --> 21:15.442
After a short but thorough investigation

21:15.567 --> 21:17.653
of our visitor,

21:18.362 --> 21:20.531
I can say, unequivocally,

21:20.864 --> 21:25.452
that I've never seen anything on any cellular level,

21:27.454 --> 21:31.041
like what we have in that other room.

21:31.333 --> 21:34.211
<i>Now, the impact of this find...</i>

21:34.294 --> 21:37.422
<i>will be felt for thousands of years.</i>

21:37.673 --> 21:39.967
<i>From this point on,</i>

21:40.092 --> 21:44.388
<i>the world as we know it has forever been altered.</i>

21:47.683 --> 21:50.978
You, my friends, will all be immortalized,

21:51.061 --> 21:54.314
as the people who made this discovery.

22:01.655 --> 22:03.198
Thank you.

22:08.704 --> 22:11.748
Do you think they're going to pay a bonus for bringing over an alien

22:11.832 --> 22:13.667
instead of coal samples?

22:23.302 --> 22:26.096
You've got anything better than this cough syrup?

22:26.680 --> 22:28.056
- Hey, Griggy.
- Yeah?

22:28.182 --> 22:30.392
You want to go out and get the cabinet stash?

22:30.475 --> 22:32.060
Sure, no problem.

22:33.020 --> 22:34.396
I'm on it.

22:59.004 --> 23:01.048
Where did I put this bottle?

24:44.067 --> 24:45.652
Jesus Ch...

24:51.658 --> 24:53.410
Screw you, man.

24:55.954 --> 24:57.664
Son of a...

25:25.776 --> 25:27.152
It broke out!

25:30.280 --> 25:31.782
What?

25:32.574 --> 25:34.660
It ain't a damn joke, man!

25:34.743 --> 25:37.079
The freaking thing's alive!

25:37.913 --> 25:40.290
I was in the room, man, looking at the ice

25:40.374 --> 25:42.084
then the freaking thing jumped out!

26:07.359 --> 26:09.736
We search in groups of two and three.

26:10.821 --> 26:11.768
The entire camp.

26:11.794 --> 26:13.365
If you find it, pull out,

26:13.365 --> 26:15.242
don't attempt anything on your own.

26:15.784 --> 26:16.994
And be careful...

26:17.161 --> 26:18.787
we don't know what condition it's in.

27:10.672 --> 27:14.259
Griggs, did you leave that open?

27:16.803 --> 27:20.432
- I don't remember.
- Shit.

27:25.646 --> 27:27.036
Hey, just be careful, man.

27:27.062 --> 27:29.466
That thing jumped through the fucking roof.

27:57.845 --> 27:58.887
Jesus Christ.

29:09.583 --> 29:11.627
Help! Over here!

29:13.003 --> 29:15.797
Help! Somebody! Over here!

29:18.300 --> 29:21.011
- It attacked Henrik.
- Come on.

29:24.556 --> 29:28.310
- Jesus!
- In there!

29:33.941 --> 29:34.988
God, somebody do something!

29:35.014 --> 29:35.634
Oh my God.

29:40.823 --> 29:42.908
Shoot it! Shoot the fucker, man!

30:05.848 --> 30:07.641
We got to burn that fucker, man! Burn it!

30:15.023 --> 30:15.983
Throw it, throw it!

31:15.542 --> 31:16.668
His blood pressure's low.

31:24.927 --> 31:26.803
Henrik and...
his small children.

31:30.724 --> 31:32.239
Yes, it's horrible.

31:32.265 --> 31:34.336
It's a horrible tragedy.

31:35.938 --> 31:37.312
We're all shocked.

31:37.338 --> 31:39.550
At what happened to Henrik.

31:41.026 --> 31:44.822
But with due respect, we need to examine
the remains before it all disintegrates.

31:45.739 --> 31:47.040
Hey, that was a man.

31:47.066 --> 31:47.975
Not remains.

31:48.158 --> 31:50.035
No, I know, I'm talking about the creature.

31:51.161 --> 31:54.414
And I'm sure we're all aware of the importance of this discovery.

31:54.581 --> 31:56.416
This may be the first and only time...

31:56.416 --> 31:59.211
mankind has been visited by an alien lifeform.

31:59.795 --> 32:03.674
And as scientists, we're obliged to study it.

32:03.674 --> 32:07.010
Didn't work out so well the last time, did it?

32:07.302 --> 32:08.929
I think you should destroy it.

32:11.181 --> 32:12.349
Completely.

32:13.892 --> 32:16.186
I think you've contributed enough to this matter now.

32:16.687 --> 32:17.855
Oh, really?

32:18.605 --> 32:22.234
Listen, your guy, Olav, back there, he's in bad shape.

32:23.694 --> 32:26.321
Now, we're gonna fly him back to McMurdo at sun-up...

32:26.321 --> 32:28.073
and take him to the military hospital.

32:29.533 --> 32:31.201
And what're you gonna tell them, hmm?

32:32.452 --> 32:36.999
I'm gonna tell them the truth, as crazy as it sounds.

33:53.534 --> 33:56.286
Kate?
Can you help here?

34:01.000 --> 34:02.502
Come on.

34:06.714 --> 34:08.466
Pull that side up.

34:34.742 --> 34:38.621
His face is encased in some type of amniotic sac.

35:05.773 --> 35:09.402
The tissue. Looks almost new.

35:12.280 --> 35:14.491
What was it doing to him?

35:15.325 --> 35:18.077
It appears that it was absorbing him.

35:18.703 --> 35:21.080
Some type of digestion.

35:21.956 --> 35:23.583
It's fascinating.

35:26.002 --> 35:27.837
<i>It is fascinating.</i>

35:44.687 --> 35:46.689
- What's the matter? Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

35:46.731 --> 35:48.483
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

35:48.525 --> 35:49.870
Do you need something?

35:49.896 --> 35:51.302
No, no. I'm okay.

36:19.055 --> 36:20.932
What is this?

36:22.851 --> 36:24.894
Looks like a titanium plate.

36:25.436 --> 36:28.731
Used to reinforce bones and compound fractures.

36:28.857 --> 36:30.775
Yeah, that's right.

36:31.150 --> 36:33.361
Henrik broke his arm last year.

36:33.486 --> 36:36.447
He had to go to Argentina to get it set.

36:40.243 --> 36:43.663
So if this was in his arm, what's it doing out of him now?

36:48.376 --> 36:49.919
That's a good question.

37:10.023 --> 37:11.566
What are you doing?

37:12.066 --> 37:14.569
Took a sample of Henrik's tissue.

37:14.652 --> 37:17.947
I want to find out what this thing was doing to him.

37:28.332 --> 37:30.792
I think you should take a look at this.

37:41.428 --> 37:43.722
These cells aren't dead.

37:45.724 --> 37:47.893
That's not possible.

37:52.981 --> 37:55.901
Looks like the alien cells are somehow

37:55.984 --> 37:58.529
attacking Henrik's cells and then they...

37:59.947 --> 38:00.448
What is that?

38:00.474 --> 38:02.015
It looks like they are transforming...

38:02.115 --> 38:04.117
They're imitating his cells.

38:06.995 --> 38:09.289
Okay, I don't know if that's what I'm seeing, but...

38:09.373 --> 38:11.291
They're imitating him.

38:38.485 --> 38:40.028
It's going to be okay, Olav.

38:40.112 --> 38:42.197
A doctor will see you in McMurdo.

38:44.616 --> 38:46.285
Kate.

38:47.369 --> 38:49.079
- Hey.
- Hi.

38:50.873 --> 38:52.291
We're leaving.

38:53.792 --> 38:56.003
Once the weather holds up, we'll be back with help...

38:56.003 --> 38:58.172
as soon as we can.

38:58.755 --> 39:00.382
Okay.

39:01.592 --> 39:03.010
Alright.

39:15.689 --> 39:17.733
- Keep him warm.
- I will.

39:17.983 --> 39:19.568
C'mon, let's go.

39:24.781 --> 39:26.241
Sit down there.

39:27.534 --> 39:29.286
There you go.

40:16.917 --> 40:19.419
Ah, let's get the hell out of here.

41:21.398 --> 41:23.817
Carter!
Carter, wait!

41:35.287 --> 41:37.664
She's flagging us down.

41:38.207 --> 41:41.251
- What's wrong?
- They shouldn't leave.

41:43.253 --> 41:44.755
Carter.

41:45.088 --> 41:46.924
Let's just get out of here, man.

41:54.389 --> 41:56.183
Alright, fuck it, we're landing.

41:56.266 --> 41:57.643
Shit.

41:57.726 --> 41:59.394
Let's take her down.

42:02.272 --> 42:03.982
Is there something wrong?

42:05.442 --> 42:07.277
No, everything's fine.

42:14.201 --> 42:15.994
Probably just forgot something.

42:17.037 --> 42:19.706
We'll be in the air in no time, okay?

42:20.999 --> 42:22.876
Don't worry.

42:23.126 --> 42:24.962
Hang in there.

42:45.315 --> 42:46.984
Something's wrong.

43:15.721 --> 43:19.183
Hailing McMurdo, or any ears on the emergency channel.

43:19.349 --> 43:21.602
Do you copy? Over.

43:23.353 --> 43:26.023
I repeat, this is Thule Station.

43:26.356 --> 43:29.693
They crashed here, right behind this ridgeline.

43:33.954 --> 43:35.498
It's impossible to reach them.

43:37.541 --> 43:39.710
This doesn't make any sense.

43:40.002 --> 43:42.421
I mean, they have plenty of visibility, right?

43:42.463 --> 43:43.956
We're not going after them?

43:43.982 --> 43:45.007
Shouldn't we try?

43:45.049 --> 43:47.259
We need a chopper to even get close to them.

43:47.384 --> 43:48.969
And there's refueling and hailing.

43:49.054 --> 43:51.273
All this can't be a coincidence.

43:53.258 --> 43:56.512
Radio's dead. It's fucking dead.

43:58.096 --> 43:59.765
The incoming storm.

43:59.848 --> 44:01.141
Fuck.

44:01.266 --> 44:02.851
There's too much interference.

44:30.295 --> 44:32.109
We have four missing persons.

44:32.135 --> 44:34.199
We have no helicopter or radio.

44:34.299 --> 44:38.470
You made a mistake for bringing these people here.

44:38.554 --> 44:40.013
More people may die.

44:40.138 --> 44:42.933
But, Sander, we don't know even if they are dead or not.

44:43.267 --> 44:46.270
Colin, Lars, get your gear.

44:48.230 --> 44:50.232
<i>We'll take a snowcat to the next base.</i>

44:50.315 --> 44:51.775
Lars, do it now.

44:52.901 --> 44:54.695
I don't think that's a good idea.

44:57.322 --> 44:58.740
And why is that?

44:59.032 --> 45:01.201
Because no one can leave this camp...

45:01.326 --> 45:03.495
until we know more about what's going on here.

45:03.579 --> 45:04.978
I make decisions about this camp.

45:05.004 --> 45:06.190
I know, Edvard, but...

45:06.290 --> 45:08.083
Why did you flag down that helicopter?

45:08.167 --> 45:09.918
Because I thought it was in danger.

45:10.002 --> 45:11.378
Why?

45:12.254 --> 45:14.590
I took a sample of Henrik's blood...

45:15.007 --> 45:17.384
and I saw that the alien cells were still alive.

45:17.509 --> 45:21.138
They were alive and they were copying Henrik's cells.

45:21.763 --> 45:23.765
Replicating them.

45:25.309 --> 45:26.810
Adam saw it too.

45:29.646 --> 45:30.981
Is that true?

45:33.859 --> 45:35.235
I don't know.

45:35.569 --> 45:37.654
I mean, I don't know what we saw.

45:37.738 --> 45:39.823
I mean, we saw something.

45:39.948 --> 45:41.108
I don't understand.

45:41.134 --> 45:42.476
What are you saying?

45:45.370 --> 45:49.750
That this thing can, and probably has,

45:49.833 --> 45:51.793
replicated a person.

45:51.919 --> 45:53.670
- What?
- That can't be.

45:53.754 --> 45:55.422
- Who?
- This is insane.

45:55.547 --> 45:57.492
Okay, Okay. Kate? Kate?

45:57.518 --> 45:58.617
Okay! Kate.

45:59.426 --> 46:01.678
This is not the time to be yelling fire.

46:02.095 --> 46:05.015
Let's stop, gather our thoughts,

46:05.140 --> 46:06.934
and discuss this in private.

46:07.017 --> 46:09.269
We don't need any private meeting, Doctor.

46:09.353 --> 46:10.812
We all want the fucking information!

46:10.938 --> 46:12.397
There's more.

46:14.983 --> 46:16.276
What are those?

46:16.401 --> 46:19.112
I think they are fillings from someone's teeth.

46:19.363 --> 46:21.740
I found them by a puddle of blood in the shower.

46:21.865 --> 46:23.158
Puddle of blood?

46:23.283 --> 46:25.786
It can clone cells, but not inorganic material.

46:25.869 --> 46:29.081
It couldn't copy these, so it spit them out.

46:30.207 --> 46:32.167
We're wasting too much time already.
Lars?

46:32.167 --> 46:33.126
Listen!

46:33.961 --> 46:37.756
When I went back to check it, someone had cleaned up the blood.

46:38.215 --> 46:40.092
Someone had wiped it away.

46:41.176 --> 46:43.512
Alright, so whatever it is...

46:44.388 --> 46:47.015
It is still here.

46:52.813 --> 46:54.356
I've heard enough.

46:54.898 --> 46:57.693
Lars, Colin, get the gear.
Ten minutes.

46:59.153 --> 47:00.821
Please, Edvard.

47:01.572 --> 47:02.573
You can't leave.

47:03.615 --> 47:04.364
You can't leave!

47:04.390 --> 47:06.310
You don't know what we're dealing with.

47:10.497 --> 47:11.540
Well done.

47:22.134 --> 47:23.093
Kate?

47:27.639 --> 47:30.225
I don't know if I should be speaking about this.

47:30.767 --> 47:32.352
I don't want to get anyone in trouble.

47:32.436 --> 47:33.520
Speaking about what?

47:34.396 --> 47:35.647
You were saying...

47:36.398 --> 47:39.860
about someone cleaning up the blood from the shower.

47:40.027 --> 47:42.112
And that someone here may not be themselves.

47:42.112 --> 47:43.238
Juliette, please...

47:44.990 --> 47:46.325
What did you see?

47:47.534 --> 47:50.133
After the crash, I think...

47:50.159 --> 47:53.815
I saw Colin coming from the showers.

47:53.916 --> 47:55.584
He was holding something.

47:56.376 --> 47:59.963
It could've been a towel, a rag, something to clean up.

48:00.714 --> 48:05.511
Kate, I can't say for sure, but it's just that I s...

48:21.652 --> 48:23.195
He's leaving with Edvard.

48:23.320 --> 48:24.863
We can't let them go.

48:25.614 --> 48:27.032
We can't let any of them go.

48:28.742 --> 48:31.495
I know where they keep the keys for the vehicles.

48:39.253 --> 48:41.880
- Where are they?
- In that drawer.

48:43.215 --> 48:44.967
- This one?
- Yes.

48:48.929 --> 48:52.349
- How many am I looking for?
- Five.

48:54.184 --> 48:55.686
Three and four.

48:57.354 --> 48:58.730
You said there were five?

49:36.393 --> 49:37.728
Run!

49:48.655 --> 49:49.990
Kate, what happened?

49:50.908 --> 49:54.328
Karl. It got Karl.
It got... Karl.

50:14.181 --> 50:15.516
Kate.

50:28.695 --> 50:30.113
Burn it!

51:33.218 --> 51:35.304
Enough, that's enough.

51:37.764 --> 51:39.766
Burn in hell.

51:57.367 --> 51:59.369
What the fuck's happening to us?

52:04.959 --> 52:06.878
It attacks its prey,

52:08.338 --> 52:10.465
copies it perfectly...

52:11.216 --> 52:13.176
and then hides inside it.

52:14.135 --> 52:15.637
Waiting.

52:18.473 --> 52:20.350
Is it still among us?

52:23.561 --> 52:25.355
It could be any of us.

52:31.444 --> 52:33.279
We got to get out of here.

52:33.404 --> 52:34.989
Yeah, right now.

52:35.073 --> 52:37.742
And it could be getting a vehicle with it.

52:39.202 --> 52:41.079
You'll be alone.

52:41.621 --> 52:43.206
Vulnerable.

52:45.208 --> 52:47.377
That's exactly what it wants.

52:48.670 --> 52:51.631
Not to mention you'll be giving it a way out of here.

52:52.298 --> 52:54.259
A way to spread.

52:56.010 --> 52:57.929
It's like a virus.

52:58.763 --> 53:00.849
So what do we do with any virus?

53:01.182 --> 53:02.851
Quarantine.

53:04.185 --> 53:07.856
We isolate it and then we kill it.

53:09.023 --> 53:10.441
Yeah.

53:11.234 --> 53:13.570
We have to rely on science.

53:13.903 --> 53:17.240
Exposing our uncontaminated blood to the cells of the creature

53:18.365 --> 53:21.493
might create a reaction...
of some kind.

53:21.577 --> 53:24.079
So we take blood samples from everybody.

53:24.496 --> 53:26.748
Yeah, and we test each one of them.

53:27.291 --> 53:29.793
Yes, Adam and I can do that.

53:31.545 --> 53:32.880
Okay.

53:35.048 --> 53:37.176
Lars and I'll disable the vehicles.

53:39.261 --> 53:41.430
We have to trust in this plan.

53:44.892 --> 53:47.478
It's our only chance of making it through this.

54:03.952 --> 54:05.787
- Is that it?
- Yes.

54:06.205 --> 54:08.665
- No more vehicles?
- Only these.

54:09.166 --> 54:10.459
Okay.

54:19.968 --> 54:21.470
What?

54:47.579 --> 54:49.081
Grenades.

54:59.258 --> 55:01.343
Is everything alright?

55:06.849 --> 55:09.226
Yes, yes, everything's fine.

55:11.395 --> 55:12.729
Good.

55:14.523 --> 55:16.817
- Lars, you're okay?
- Yes.

55:16.942 --> 55:18.861
Kate, we should go.

55:19.444 --> 55:21.280
The storm is getting worse.

55:37.087 --> 55:38.589
Who is that?

55:50.934 --> 55:52.769
Hurry up. They're coming.

56:06.783 --> 56:08.577
The Americans.

56:11.788 --> 56:14.917
It is impossible for a human to survive in that crash.

56:16.376 --> 56:18.158
We should burn them.

56:18.184 --> 56:20.322
Right here, right now.

56:21.173 --> 56:23.425
- Let's finish them off!
- Peder?

56:24.343 --> 56:26.011
It could be murder.

56:26.094 --> 56:27.367
It could be survival, Kate.

56:27.393 --> 56:29.373
Yes, but we don't have to kill them.

56:29.473 --> 56:31.850
Right? We can just lock them up...

56:31.975 --> 56:34.269
until the Sander's test is ready.

56:34.937 --> 56:36.522
Please.

56:38.148 --> 56:39.650
Please.

57:34.454 --> 57:36.081
So this is a good idea?

57:38.750 --> 57:40.169
Locking us up?

57:43.755 --> 57:45.257
You need our help.

58:02.691 --> 58:05.903
Warn your scientists they can't handle with what we saw in that chopper.

58:07.571 --> 58:09.615
For all I know, you could be one of those things.

58:11.658 --> 58:14.161
It's pretty hard to believe you both walked away from that crash.

58:14.495 --> 58:16.001
Yeah, I get that, I do, but...

58:16.027 --> 58:17.481
We're preparing a test.

58:19.917 --> 58:21.335
And then we figure out who's who.

58:23.170 --> 58:24.713
It's all I can offer you right now.

59:10.968 --> 59:13.053
Damn!
There's a fire here!

59:31.238 --> 59:32.445
Someone sabotaged it.

59:32.471 --> 59:34.308
There's nothing left. Nothing.

59:34.700 --> 59:36.076
Now there's no test.

59:37.286 --> 59:38.495
How could this happen?

59:39.246 --> 59:40.622
It was no accident.

59:41.790 --> 59:42.749
You.

59:44.084 --> 59:45.460
You were in there with him.

59:46.086 --> 59:47.546
You were the last one.

59:47.880 --> 59:50.090
- How are you accusing me?
- Why not?

59:51.049 --> 59:52.098
He's got something to hide.

59:52.124 --> 59:53.327
What are you, an asshole?

59:53.468 --> 59:54.861
I was the one working on the test.

59:54.887 --> 59:55.829
I left for 2 minutes!

59:55.888 --> 59:57.097
You just don't want us to know the truth,

59:57.097 --> 59:58.473
- do ya?
- Bullshit!

59:58.557 --> 01:00:01.393
This is a goddamn fucking nightmare!

01:00:01.685 --> 01:00:02.936
There might be another way.

01:00:07.441 --> 01:00:11.737
I think there might be...
another way to tell.

01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:30.005
Peder, give me your flashlight.

01:00:35.552 --> 01:00:37.638
Now tell Lars...
to open his mouth.

01:00:38.889 --> 01:00:40.098
Tell him to open his mouth.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.104
Open your mouth.

01:00:53.946 --> 01:00:55.656
That's good.

01:00:56.114 --> 01:00:57.792
Lars has fillings.

01:00:57.818 --> 01:00:59.309
So he's human.

01:00:59.368 --> 01:01:01.578
It can't imitate inorganic material.

01:01:02.871 --> 01:01:04.289
See?

01:01:05.791 --> 01:01:07.167
Yes.

01:01:17.219 --> 01:01:18.595
Good.

01:01:19.638 --> 01:01:21.223
Good.

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:24.560
Open.

01:01:25.185 --> 01:01:26.645
Come on!

01:01:27.688 --> 01:01:29.398
You're next!

01:01:29.481 --> 01:01:31.275
Open your mouth!

01:01:39.032 --> 01:01:40.242
Okay.

01:01:41.827 --> 01:01:43.537
Good.

01:01:47.457 --> 01:01:49.668
Right now, it's at least something.

01:01:50.752 --> 01:01:52.588
A way to eliminate some of us.

01:01:52.671 --> 01:01:55.048
So I'm gonna get killed because I floss?

01:01:55.174 --> 01:01:57.134
Nobody's getting killed.

01:01:57.467 --> 01:01:58.802
Kate?

01:01:58.927 --> 01:02:01.805
Kate, come on.

01:02:02.181 --> 01:02:03.640
Kate.

01:02:05.517 --> 01:02:07.019
Just do it.

01:02:07.644 --> 01:02:08.937
Kate.

01:02:12.149 --> 01:02:13.317
Open.

01:02:29.958 --> 01:02:31.668
Just go stand over there.

01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:48.101
You know as well as I do, there are too many variables.

01:02:50.813 --> 01:02:52.105
Open your mouth.

01:02:57.736 --> 01:02:58.946
Open your mouth!

01:03:01.073 --> 01:03:02.199
They're porcelain.

01:03:06.995 --> 01:03:08.372
Go stand with Adam.

01:03:13.293 --> 01:03:15.003
Anyone else with porcelain fillings?

01:03:15.838 --> 01:03:17.172
Or clean teeth?

01:03:21.134 --> 01:03:22.427
It's bloody absurd.

01:03:42.573 --> 01:03:43.824
This is wrong.

01:04:10.184 --> 01:04:13.020
Jonas, you and Lars go out.

01:04:13.103 --> 01:04:15.606
Get Carter and Jameson, bring them in here, we'll check them too.

01:04:15.772 --> 01:04:18.040
But why don't we just leave them where they are?

01:04:18.066 --> 01:04:19.176
They can't do anything.

01:04:19.234 --> 01:04:20.277
We need to know.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.696
- What?
- She wants us to find the Americans.

01:04:22.779 --> 01:04:24.198
Let's do it, then.

01:04:25.657 --> 01:04:26.909
Come on!

01:04:48.555 --> 01:04:49.681
She is smart.

01:04:54.812 --> 01:04:55.729
Yeah.

01:04:57.439 --> 01:04:59.107
She is in control now.

01:05:47.573 --> 01:05:49.158
Shit, they've gone.

01:05:50.325 --> 01:05:51.702
They escaped.

01:05:52.786 --> 01:05:53.787
Lars.

01:05:54.913 --> 01:05:56.790
Let's go back inside.

01:05:58.250 --> 01:06:00.836
No.
We have to find them.

01:06:02.337 --> 01:06:03.382
Lars, be careful.

01:06:03.408 --> 01:06:04.698
They are not human!

01:06:06.425 --> 01:06:07.384
Lars!

01:06:08.218 --> 01:06:09.428
Lars!

01:06:10.762 --> 01:06:11.722
Lars!

01:06:11.722 --> 01:06:13.056
Lars!

01:06:13.932 --> 01:06:15.809
Lars Wait.

01:06:16.351 --> 01:06:17.269
Lars.

01:06:21.315 --> 01:06:22.274
Peder.

01:06:24.276 --> 01:06:25.277
Stay calm!

01:06:29.198 --> 01:06:30.324
The threat isn't here.

01:06:30.949 --> 01:06:32.117
It's out there.

01:06:32.826 --> 01:06:35.078
The Americans are the real enemy.

01:06:36.330 --> 01:06:37.956
He's right, Peder.

01:06:38.207 --> 01:06:40.626
Whatever they're saying right now, it doesn't matter.

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:43.795
You can't trust them.

01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:49.343
Watch them.

01:06:54.264 --> 01:06:55.349
Kate!

01:06:55.724 --> 01:06:57.017
Come on!

01:07:01.021 --> 01:07:02.439
Come on!

01:07:03.273 --> 01:07:04.691
Where are they?

01:07:04.775 --> 01:07:05.923
Where's the rest?

01:07:05.949 --> 01:07:07.636
They attacked them.

01:07:07.694 --> 01:07:09.154
- Who?
- They got Lars!

01:07:09.238 --> 01:07:11.949
- Peder!
- They took Lars!

01:07:12.032 --> 01:07:12.560
What happened?

01:07:12.586 --> 01:07:13.642
Peder, keep them back.

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:14.553
We have to help him.

01:07:14.579 --> 01:07:15.686
Stay on them, Peder.

01:07:15.786 --> 01:07:16.495
What happened?

01:07:16.521 --> 01:07:17.938
Peder, they took Lars.

01:07:18.038 --> 01:07:19.132
The enemy is out there.

01:07:19.158 --> 01:07:21.108
We don't know if we can trust them!

01:07:21.166 --> 01:07:23.377
Peder, don't listen to them.

01:07:23.752 --> 01:07:25.963
Stay on them! Stay on them, Peder!

01:07:31.343 --> 01:07:32.511
They're inside.

01:07:45.149 --> 01:07:46.483
Where is Lars?

01:07:46.483 --> 01:07:47.734
We haven't got Lars.

01:07:47.985 --> 01:07:49.736
- Calm down!
- Where is Lars?

01:07:49.903 --> 01:07:51.321
I said calm down!

01:07:51.405 --> 01:07:53.949
- Where the fuck is Lars?
- Drop it!

01:07:55.492 --> 01:07:56.618
Somebody tell him.

01:07:56.644 --> 01:07:58.770
Peder, don't listen to them.

01:07:59.621 --> 01:08:01.707
- Put it down!
- They killed Lars!

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.489
Lars is killed.

01:08:03.515 --> 01:08:05.736
Burn them! Burn them!

01:08:19.975 --> 01:08:22.019
Peder? Peder?

01:08:26.023 --> 01:08:27.274
Okay!

01:08:28.274 --> 01:08:30.109
I just wanna check my friend, okay?

01:08:31.278 --> 01:08:32.362
It's okay.

01:08:33.863 --> 01:08:35.115
He was gonna fire.

01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:49.176
It's gonna catch fire!

01:08:49.203 --> 01:08:49.796
It will explode!

01:08:49.796 --> 01:08:50.923
Come on! Let's go!

01:09:11.902 --> 01:09:12.819
Edvard?

01:09:15.697 --> 01:09:16.698
Edvard?

01:09:26.166 --> 01:09:27.960
- Pick him up.
- Okay.

01:09:32.171 --> 01:09:33.090
You.

01:09:33.966 --> 01:09:35.133
Yeah, you. Help him!

01:09:44.350 --> 01:09:45.727
Alright, show yourselves!

01:09:47.479 --> 01:09:48.897
Right fucking now!

01:09:55.612 --> 01:09:56.905
Everybody in the rec room.

01:10:03.871 --> 01:10:05.122
Pick him up, come on.

01:10:12.713 --> 01:10:13.839
Sit down.

01:10:21.263 --> 01:10:23.056
Not all of us are human.

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:26.602
Just put him over there on the couch.

01:10:42.826 --> 01:10:44.828
Help! Help me!

01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:46.705
- My God!
- Get it off him!

01:10:48.207 --> 01:10:50.250
What the fuck is this shit, man?

01:11:00.928 --> 01:11:02.387
Carter, Carter!

01:11:02.513 --> 01:11:03.722
Carter, burn it, man!

01:11:05.015 --> 01:11:06.572
There's something wrong with it!

01:11:06.598 --> 01:11:07.084
Hold on!

01:11:07.142 --> 01:11:09.353
Goddamn it, Carter, burn it!

01:11:14.650 --> 01:11:16.151
Look out!
Fuck!

01:11:17.152 --> 01:11:18.111
Adam!

01:11:25.369 --> 01:11:27.329
- Shit!
- Carter, take it!

01:11:29.915 --> 01:11:30.958
Carter!

01:11:31.041 --> 01:11:32.584
There's something wrong with the pressure.

01:11:33.293 --> 01:11:34.545
Put some air in the pipe.

01:11:37.089 --> 01:11:38.090
Watch out!

01:11:40.008 --> 01:11:40.968
Carter!

01:11:52.646 --> 01:11:53.897
We gotta get the air up.

01:12:00.988 --> 01:12:01.947
No.

01:12:17.087 --> 01:12:18.046
No.

01:12:18.338 --> 01:12:19.840
No.

01:12:20.716 --> 01:12:21.592
God!

01:12:22.551 --> 01:12:23.802
No, God!

01:12:25.053 --> 01:12:26.180
Carter!

01:12:28.765 --> 01:12:29.975
No! No!

01:13:37.668 --> 01:13:39.711
I'm with you, buddy.

01:14:27.259 --> 01:14:28.135
Carter.

01:14:33.807 --> 01:14:34.850
You're okay?

01:14:36.143 --> 01:14:37.102
Yeah.

01:14:40.856 --> 01:14:41.982
And you?

01:14:42.983 --> 01:14:44.610
Not yet, no.

01:14:45.194 --> 01:14:48.155
We find it and then we kill it.

01:15:58.892 --> 01:16:00.519
I think that was Sander.

01:16:01.895 --> 01:16:02.896
Yeah.

01:16:23.417 --> 01:16:25.961
- Shit!
- Watch out! God!

01:16:28.088 --> 01:16:30.090
Kate, do you see it?

01:16:30.507 --> 01:16:31.383
Where'd it go?

01:16:33.177 --> 01:16:34.219
There!

01:16:35.804 --> 01:16:36.722
Get back!

01:16:47.191 --> 01:16:48.692
Don't.
Don't touch it.

01:17:07.544 --> 01:17:08.670
You hear that?

01:17:09.421 --> 01:17:10.422
Yeah.

01:20:57.983 --> 01:20:58.942
Kate!

01:21:23.258 --> 01:21:24.384
- Sander.
- Wait.

01:21:25.052 --> 01:21:26.136
So what?

01:21:27.554 --> 01:21:28.889
He'll freeze out there.

01:21:28.931 --> 01:21:30.307
And if he doesn't?

01:21:31.016 --> 01:21:32.226
If it makes it out of here...

01:21:34.061 --> 01:21:35.562
millions of people could die.

01:21:35.562 --> 01:21:36.910
It's got nowhere to go.

01:21:36.936 --> 01:21:38.048
Yes, it does.

01:21:49.827 --> 01:21:52.246
Alright.

01:22:35.747 --> 01:22:37.082
What?

01:22:41.670 --> 01:22:43.172
What happened to Lars?

01:22:44.756 --> 01:22:46.425
We didn't kill him.

01:23:43.023 --> 01:23:44.316
Come on.

01:24:12.886 --> 01:24:14.179
Run, run!

01:24:32.072 --> 01:24:33.031
Kate!

01:24:34.491 --> 01:24:35.826
Kate!

01:24:37.953 --> 01:24:39.413
Kate!

01:26:05.290 --> 01:26:06.208
Kate?

01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:12.047
Kate?

01:30:27.553 --> 01:30:28.637
Kate!

01:31:38.664 --> 01:31:39.916
So what we do now?

01:31:45.922 --> 01:31:47.548
There's a Russian station...

01:31:48.549 --> 01:31:50.092
about 50 miles from here.

01:31:52.553 --> 01:31:53.930
Should have enough gas.

01:32:01.938 --> 01:32:03.856
We're gonna make it back, okay?

01:32:07.401 --> 01:32:08.361
Okay.

01:32:28.256 --> 01:32:29.382
Let's go.

01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:33.005
I'm gonna put this in the back.

01:32:50.112 --> 01:32:51.864
You know how I knew you weren't human...

01:32:53.824 --> 01:32:55.367
when you showed up back at base?

01:32:57.828 --> 01:32:58.787
No.

01:33:02.082 --> 01:33:03.333
Your earring.

01:33:12.426 --> 01:33:13.927
It was on your other ear.

01:33:25.814 --> 01:33:26.899
Kate?

01:33:27.524 --> 01:33:29.610
Kate, what're you doing?

01:33:30.861 --> 01:33:32.154
Let's talk about it.

01:33:33.238 --> 01:33:34.239
Talk to me.

01:33:34.740 --> 01:33:35.699
Kate?

01:33:36.158 --> 01:33:37.075
Kate!

01:33:38.494 --> 01:33:39.411
Kate!

01:33:42.122 --> 01:33:44.124
No!...

01:36:05.557 --> 01:36:06.683
Oh my God.

01:36:14.566 --> 01:36:19.154
Hello?
Hello, can anybody hear me?

01:36:20.823 --> 01:36:21.865
Hello?

01:36:24.451 --> 01:36:25.494
Edvard?

01:36:26.537 --> 01:36:27.579
Edvard?

01:36:31.959 --> 01:36:33.335
Edvard?

01:36:35.838 --> 01:36:36.755
Edvard?

01:36:38.215 --> 01:36:39.967
Lars, it's me.

01:36:48.308 --> 01:36:49.476
Hello, Lars!

01:36:58.443 --> 01:37:00.762
Lars? Lars, it's Matias.

01:37:00.788 --> 01:37:02.139
It's Matias!

01:37:02.406 --> 01:37:04.074
- Open your mouth.
- What?

01:37:04.408 --> 01:37:06.746
Do what I say, now!

01:37:06.772 --> 01:37:08.453
It's Matias.

01:37:08.479 --> 01:37:11.840
Lars, it's me, Matias.

01:37:22.718 --> 01:37:24.317
That's no dog.

01:37:24.343 --> 01:37:27.539
Start the helicopter, now!

01:37:35.147 --> 01:37:37.255
Get it up, get it up!
Now!

01:37:37.281 --> 01:37:38.091
Come on!
