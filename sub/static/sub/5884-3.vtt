00:00.573 --> 00:01.257
Don't.

00:01.433 --> 00:03.394
<i>Previously on
AMC's Mad Men...</i>

00:03.810 --> 00:04.673
Don't what?

00:05.809 --> 00:06.875
This is the one.

00:07.129 --> 00:08.169
Who is she?

00:08.426 --> 00:09.986
She's the soul of the world.

00:10.706 --> 00:11.977
What does it mean?

00:12.162 --> 00:13.594
The only thing keeping
you from being happy

00:13.721 --> 00:15.451
is the belief that
you are alone.

00:18.331 --> 00:19.233
Do you miss London?

00:19.331 --> 00:20.042
God, yes.

00:20.498 --> 00:22.169
Stop telling what to do,
I know what you want.

00:22.283 --> 00:23.707
So do it.

00:25.505 --> 00:26.794
I joined the army, Joanie.

00:26.947 --> 00:28.323
You're gonna be taken care of

00:28.466 --> 00:30.089
and I'm gonna be a Sargent.

Remind me...
when did you stop
taking the pills?

01:12.514 --> 01:14.149
They ran out on the 2nd.

01:14.217 --> 01:16.553
I'd say I would
expect to be fertile again
at the end of the cycle,

01:16.621 --> 01:18.690
Although from my experience
it's more likely a month.

01:18.757 --> 01:20.893
All this time
I've been afraid to skip one

01:20.961 --> 01:24.634
- But it could take a month?
- Why don't you join him
for basic training?

01:24.702 --> 01:26.405
It would boost
the men's morale.

01:28.108 --> 01:30.974
From what I remember,
San Antonio is lovely
this time of year.

01:31.042 --> 01:32.610
We don't know when he's going.

01:32.678 --> 01:34.913
You've been married
two years, Joan?

01:34.981 --> 01:36.549
Most gals your age don't wait.

01:38.019 --> 01:40.188
We have a plan.

01:40.256 --> 01:41.957
Uh-huh.

01:42.024 --> 01:43.993
Jojo, I know it's none
of my business,

01:44.061 --> 01:46.731
But I only went to Korea
because they made me.

01:46.799 --> 01:49.168
I didn't have
a choice or a wife.

01:49.236 --> 01:51.838
All I want to know is
if my husband and I
can start a family...

01:51.906 --> 01:53.574
<i>When my husband
and I can start a family.</i>

01:55.978 --> 01:57.012
Go get 'em.

01:59.216 --> 02:00.917
- Walter.
- Yes?

02:00.985 --> 02:02.586
I just want
to make sure that...

02:03.956 --> 02:05.890
You know I've had
a couple of procedures.

02:05.958 --> 02:08.092
I just want to make sure
they don't affect anything.

02:08.161 --> 02:11.130
A couple?
I only remember one.

02:11.199 --> 02:13.234
There was one before that.

02:13.301 --> 02:14.569
Should I be worried?

02:16.839 --> 02:18.807
Was the other performed
by a physician?

02:20.110 --> 02:21.811
She said she was a midwife.

02:21.879 --> 02:24.915
Well, you got pregnant
subsequently,

02:24.983 --> 02:26.851
And I know everything
went fine here

02:26.919 --> 02:28.520
And, physically,
everything looks fine.

02:30.524 --> 02:32.759
Like the song says,
"whatever will be will be."

02:34.028 --> 02:35.195
Happy new year.

02:47.579 --> 02:49.013
Good morning,
Mr. Draper.

02:49.081 --> 02:51.584
Good morning, Allison.

02:51.652 --> 02:54.220
- Coffee?
- Yes please.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.602
Ah. I'm glad
I caught you
before you left.

03:06.670 --> 03:08.671
The flight's
not until 12:30.

03:08.739 --> 03:11.475
Well, still you've got
to fight the tourists
for a taxi,

03:11.542 --> 03:13.711
Then if you hit traffic...
Triborough bridge,

03:13.778 --> 03:16.447
Somebody's always
running out of gas
and I think you know who.

03:18.684 --> 03:22.921
So I saw on your way
to Acapulco you have
24 hours in Los Angeles.

03:22.989 --> 03:24.823
- What do you want?
- The brown derby,

03:24.891 --> 03:26.826
Bill asher...
he'll probably
try to cast you.

03:26.893 --> 03:28.962
- Morning, don, Harry.
- Hello.

03:29.029 --> 03:30.698
- Am I interrupting?
- No.

03:30.765 --> 03:33.301
I'll see you
at the traffic meeting
this afternoon.

03:33.369 --> 03:34.903
We're still
doing that? Why?

03:34.971 --> 03:36.939
Just go to England already.
Stop feeling guilty.

03:37.007 --> 03:38.642
Take two weeks...
you'll be twice as happy.

03:38.710 --> 03:41.178
I'm happy when I'm working.

03:41.247 --> 03:43.248
I'm sure another day
and a half of work

03:43.316 --> 03:44.750
Will not come close
to the amount

03:44.818 --> 03:47.252
Of fiddling about you did
in Los Angeles this year.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.553
Okay.
Happy new year, don.

03:53.257 --> 03:56.692
Oh, there you are.
Please make sure
he signs these.

03:56.760 --> 03:59.762
If I don't see you,
happy new year.

03:59.829 --> 04:01.196
Enjoy your family.

04:02.699 --> 04:04.533
Would you like
to sign these now?

04:04.601 --> 04:06.268
Might as well.

04:10.140 --> 04:13.209
So what will you be doing?

04:13.277 --> 04:15.577
Don't worry.
I'll be here
till the bitter end.

04:16.978 --> 04:19.010
No, I mean for new year's.

04:19.077 --> 04:22.177
I'm gonna go see
my sister in Patterson
over the weekend and...

04:22.245 --> 04:24.410
I don't know...
probably Times Square.

04:24.478 --> 04:26.077
I always wondered who did that.

04:27.444 --> 04:29.111
It was a little
scary last year,

04:29.179 --> 04:31.814
But I think we'll
have a whole bunch
of girls this time.

04:31.881 --> 04:34.983
- And sailors.
- I'm sure.

04:35.051 --> 04:37.285
<i>- but for the rest
of the week,</i>

04:37.353 --> 04:40.287
If you want me
or someone else on your desk
for West coast hours,

04:40.354 --> 04:41.955
- I can arrange that.
- I'll be fine.

04:42.022 --> 04:44.423
Well, I'll let you know
when you should leave.

04:44.490 --> 04:46.057
Thank you.

04:52.665 --> 04:54.866
- Why is the door shut?
- I don't like pipe smoke.

04:54.934 --> 04:57.135
- He's very considerate.
- Could you tell him I'm here?

04:57.203 --> 04:59.371
What is this regarding?

05:02.508 --> 05:04.875
Sorry to bother you,
but since Roger's not here,

05:04.943 --> 05:06.611
I am sending Caroline
uptown to get me

05:06.678 --> 05:08.980
Some fried chicken for lunch
and I know you like it.

05:09.048 --> 05:10.982
- Interested?
- I am.

05:11.049 --> 05:14.218
- Breast? Thigh?
- One of each.

05:15.687 --> 05:18.088
Oh, I wanted to ask you...

05:18.155 --> 05:19.956
I would like
to put in a request now

05:20.023 --> 05:21.890
For a few days off
the second week of January.

05:21.958 --> 05:23.791
You have new year's off.

05:23.859 --> 05:26.760
My husband's a doctor.
His schedule's not flexible.

05:28.797 --> 05:30.999
Why don't you
go home and ask him
how he would feel

05:31.067 --> 05:33.601
About some nurse asking
for a holiday immediately
following a holiday?

05:35.137 --> 05:36.837
I would be happy with two days.

05:36.905 --> 05:39.873
Our financial planning
and expense budgets
for next year...

05:39.941 --> 05:42.009
- I'll need you
to assist me.
- We can do it now.

05:42.076 --> 05:43.543
No one knows why
we're here anyway.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.512
Because there's work to do.

05:46.580 --> 05:49.715
And I understand
that all men are dizzy
and powerless to refuse you,

05:49.783 --> 05:51.817
But consider me
the incorruptible exception.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.185
Fried chicken indeed.

05:54.988 --> 05:57.022
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have asked.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.290
Don't go and cry about it.

05:58.357 --> 05:59.691
Excuse me?

06:01.026 --> 06:03.327
I said don't go
and cry about it.

06:41.691 --> 06:42.891
Hey.

06:44.694 --> 06:48.162
- Get off my porch.
- You actually came.

06:52.400 --> 06:55.135
- What the hell
happened to your leg?
- It's broken.

06:55.202 --> 06:57.103
It didn't work that well
to begin with.

07:00.774 --> 07:02.007
How are you?

07:04.043 --> 07:06.644
Aw. You just need
a little r&r.

07:13.918 --> 07:15.986
What happened?

07:16.053 --> 07:17.587
Don't fry eggs in bare feet.

07:17.655 --> 07:19.989
Sit down.

07:20.057 --> 07:22.591
- What do you want?
- Half of what you have.

07:25.194 --> 07:27.361
- You've got a leak.
- I fixed the roof.

07:27.429 --> 07:29.129
It just needs a little makeup.

07:29.197 --> 07:32.331
- Call a painter.
- I don't know.

07:32.398 --> 07:35.233
Once it stopped smelling,
I kind of forgot about it.

07:40.703 --> 07:42.770
I wondered whose car that was.

07:42.838 --> 07:44.705
- Hello, dick.
- Hello, patty.

07:44.773 --> 07:46.906
- It's been too long.
- Stephanie.

07:46.974 --> 07:48.775
Stephanie.

07:48.842 --> 07:50.542
Last time I saw you,
you didn't have front teeth.

07:52.111 --> 07:54.178
They're helping me while
I'm in my fragile state,

07:54.246 --> 07:55.846
Although no one asked them too.

07:55.913 --> 07:59.181
- Can I get you something?
- No, we live in South Pasadena.

07:59.249 --> 08:01.482
It's a long drive.
Are you staying?

08:01.550 --> 08:03.784
- Just for the night.
- Here?

08:03.851 --> 08:07.219
Patty, remember you
told me to tell you
if you were intruding?

08:07.286 --> 08:09.720
Try to keep her off her feet.

08:09.788 --> 08:12.423
The cast isn't stable
and we don't need
any more accidents.

08:13.926 --> 08:15.994
Aunt Anna, I just left
everything on the bed.

08:16.062 --> 08:17.431
I don't know where things go.

08:17.499 --> 08:18.867
You can tell by looking.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.515
She's never gotten over
me flunking home-EC.

08:28.582 --> 08:30.249
dick, fix her a drink.

08:30.317 --> 08:33.385
- Are you drinking age?
- Yes, but don't bother.

08:33.453 --> 08:35.621
Stephanie is studying
poly-sci at cal.

08:35.688 --> 08:37.256
She should be studying music.

08:37.323 --> 08:40.826
Berkeley?
Are you sitting in?

08:40.894 --> 08:43.095
I agree with what
they're doing,

08:43.162 --> 08:46.031
But somebody's
gotta go to class.

08:48.066 --> 08:50.734
- Steph, are you ready?
- Why don't you two
stay for dinner?

08:50.802 --> 08:52.802
Glenn and I have
a bridge game
at the Dickson's

08:52.870 --> 08:54.637
And he's expecting
a dinner of his own.

08:54.705 --> 08:56.239
Good, 'cause I only
want her her to stay.

08:56.306 --> 08:59.472
- How will she get home?
- I have a car.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.572
Or she'll spend the night.
You can get her
in the morning.

09:04.575 --> 09:07.810
Okay, you figure it out.
Good night, sweetheart.

09:09.612 --> 09:12.246
You know I'm very grateful.

09:12.314 --> 09:14.748
If I don't see you,
dick, happy new year.

09:14.816 --> 09:15.983
Happy new year.

09:20.788 --> 09:22.889
I'm going to wash
the road off me,

09:22.957 --> 09:25.425
And then we are
going to that place
with the beer and abalone.

09:25.493 --> 09:27.627
Perfect.
Sounds like there's
towels all over the bed.

09:30.331 --> 09:32.865
- Why am I staying?
- I wanted him to meet you

09:32.933 --> 09:34.833
And I know you've got grass.

09:39.970 --> 09:41.770
Hello.

09:41.838 --> 09:45.139
Ah. Come over here.

09:46.775 --> 09:49.177
- Is that your dinner?
- I love your chicken.

09:51.813 --> 09:54.981
- How was the doctor?
- Everything's good.

09:55.049 --> 09:58.185
Good.
I have to go.

09:58.252 --> 10:00.153
Let me at least heat it up.

10:00.220 --> 10:01.687
You can take it with you.

10:03.723 --> 10:06.090
Peabody's offered
his place in the Poconos
for the 14th and 15th.

10:06.157 --> 10:08.824
Greg, I can't
get away, not then.

10:08.891 --> 10:10.692
Joanie, I have
to work new year's.

10:10.759 --> 10:12.360
I had to trade it for January.

10:12.428 --> 10:14.462
Then get one of
the Jewish docs to do it.

10:14.530 --> 10:16.630
- You worked
on their holiday.
- Joanie...

10:16.698 --> 10:19.400
You don't think
I'd rather be smelling
perfume than Lysol?

10:19.467 --> 10:20.901
Tell me what you want me to do.

10:20.969 --> 10:22.870
I guess it's not
your problem too.

10:25.107 --> 10:27.340
Why don't you just not show up?

10:27.408 --> 10:29.709
- I'll lose my job.
- We'll make it.

10:29.776 --> 10:32.210
- Until when?
- Until I leave for basic,

10:32.278 --> 10:34.413
And then it's just
a couple of weeks
and then I'll be home.

10:34.480 --> 10:36.582
And then you're
going to Vietnam.

10:36.649 --> 10:39.718
- We don't know that.
- Oh, that makes me
feel better.

10:39.786 --> 10:41.886
Just keep marking off
the days on the calendar

10:41.954 --> 10:43.921
While keep planning
for our future.

10:43.989 --> 10:46.356
I'll see you tomorrow
when you're on your way out.

10:50.327 --> 10:52.895
- You don't even know
when you're going!
- Soon.

10:56.799 --> 10:59.767
<i>- so I'd say Laura was
the worst roommate.</i>

10:59.835 --> 11:02.736
She had a nervous breakdown.

11:02.804 --> 11:05.972
One morning she's
reading the bible

11:06.040 --> 11:07.507
<i>Instead
of her psych book.</i>

11:07.575 --> 11:09.975
The next morning
she woke me up,

11:10.043 --> 11:12.877
Leaning over me
with this crazy smile,

11:12.945 --> 11:15.446
And said, "morning, Stephanie.

11:15.514 --> 11:17.148
Have you heard
the good news?"

11:17.215 --> 11:18.982
There are worse things.

11:19.050 --> 11:21.518
No, there aren't.

11:21.585 --> 11:24.253
Where did you go
to school, dick?

11:24.321 --> 11:25.888
<i>♪ when you first try
to shoot the curve... ♪</i>

11:25.956 --> 11:29.191
I strung together
a few nonconsecutive years

11:29.258 --> 11:31.693
In night school, city college.

11:31.761 --> 11:34.095
A self-made man.

11:34.163 --> 11:38.232
What's it like
taking off your suit
and returning to the wild?

11:38.299 --> 11:40.734
I really don't
like how political
you're getting.

11:40.802 --> 11:42.502
I'm not political.

11:42.570 --> 11:45.338
I just don't understand
who's in charge.

11:45.406 --> 11:47.374
You're in charge.

11:47.441 --> 11:49.342
Trust me.
I work in advertising.

11:49.410 --> 11:52.444
You're kidding me.
It's pollution.

11:52.512 --> 11:54.279
So stop buying things.

11:55.647 --> 11:57.815
Don't think
that's not possible.

12:01.018 --> 12:03.319
I'll say this in terms

12:03.387 --> 12:05.722
I will be right back
after this brief message

12:05.790 --> 12:07.557
From Jan and Dean.

12:07.625 --> 12:10.226
<i>♪ just try a "Quasimodo"
or "the coffin" too... ♪</i>

12:10.294 --> 12:13.162
I like to think I had
a bit of a hand in that.

12:13.229 --> 12:15.328
you and God.

12:16.830 --> 12:18.929
Young people are gonna save us.

12:18.997 --> 12:20.763
<i>♪ so get your girl

12:20.831 --> 12:22.598
How would you feel
about me bringing
the kids out this spring?

12:22.666 --> 12:25.000
Really?

12:25.068 --> 12:27.335
You know how badly
I've wanted to meet them.

12:27.403 --> 12:28.803
<i>♪ you're an
asphalt athlete... ♪</i>

12:28.871 --> 12:30.371
So what, I'll be their aunt?

12:31.706 --> 12:33.407
Wait till they tell Betty that.

12:33.474 --> 12:35.408
You told me
you told her everything.

12:35.476 --> 12:36.876
She'll understand.

12:38.544 --> 12:40.611
I don't think
she'll ever understand.

12:40.679 --> 12:43.614
You had to know she'd be hurt.

12:43.681 --> 12:46.115
<i>♪ why don't you skateboard me?
Why don't you ♪</i>

12:46.183 --> 12:47.617
<i>♪ grab your board

12:47.685 --> 12:51.452
After I told her
I felt... Relieved.

12:53.421 --> 12:56.023
I kept thinking
how small it was

12:56.090 --> 12:57.859
- Compared to
how long it went on.
- Small?

12:57.927 --> 12:59.963
I know. I...

13:01.899 --> 13:03.800
It's just...

13:03.868 --> 13:05.935
<i>♪ why don't you
skateboard me? ♪</i>

13:06.003 --> 13:07.803
<i>- ♪ why don't you ♪
- ♪ grab your board ♪</i>

13:07.871 --> 13:10.506
<i>♪ and go sidewalk surfin'

13:10.573 --> 13:12.374
I could tell

13:12.442 --> 13:15.476
The minute she saw
who I really was...

13:17.979 --> 13:19.780
She never wanted
to look at me again.

13:23.950 --> 13:26.717
<i>♪ if you're FD

13:26.785 --> 13:29.285
Which is why I never told her.

13:30.821 --> 13:33.823
<i>- Oh, dick.
- ♪ quaint little villages... ♪</i>

13:33.891 --> 13:35.760

13:38.363 --> 13:39.830

13:39.898 --> 13:42.298
<i>♪ with old Cape Cod... ♪</i>

13:42.366 --> 13:45.534
I ought I'd play something
so you two could dance.

13:45.602 --> 13:47.802
How the hell am I gonna dance?

13:47.870 --> 13:50.671
I don't know how
you ever danced to this.

13:52.239 --> 13:53.239
Come on.

13:54.741 --> 13:56.942
Keep your hands
at 100 and 2:00.

13:57.010 --> 14:01.913
<i>♪ served by a window

14:01.981 --> 14:05.050
<i>- ♪ you're sure ♪

14:05.117 --> 14:08.855
<i>♪ with old Cape Cod... ♪</i>

14:08.923 --> 14:10.657
So you picked this song
because it's old?

14:12.893 --> 14:15.094
That doesn't mean it's bad.

14:15.162 --> 14:17.530
It's kind of corny.

14:19.299 --> 14:22.001
I think it sounds
like she's inviting us

14:22.069 --> 14:25.070
To a very beautiful place

14:25.138 --> 14:27.873
Where there's
no surfing at all.

14:29.408 --> 14:30.875
Have you ever been there?

14:30.943 --> 14:34.145
Mmm, no.

14:34.213 --> 14:36.080
<i>♪ remind you
of the town... ♪</i>

14:36.148 --> 14:39.884
But... Every time
I hear this song,

14:39.952 --> 14:41.719
I want to go.

14:41.787 --> 14:46.991
<i>♪ if you spend an evening,
you'll want to stay ♪</i>

14:47.058 --> 14:52.929
<i>♪ watching the moonlight

14:52.997 --> 14:55.365
<i>♪ you're sure to... ♪</i>

15:00.271 --> 15:03.173
I know for a fact
you did not break
that leg making eggs.

15:03.240 --> 15:06.342
I used to love sitting,

15:06.410 --> 15:08.244
And now that I have to,
I hate it.

15:08.312 --> 15:10.346
I should get home.

15:12.682 --> 15:14.983
I'll drive you.
I'll put the top up.

15:15.051 --> 15:16.418
That's okay.
I'll hitch.

15:18.321 --> 15:19.821
I do it all the time.

15:19.889 --> 15:21.356
You'll get picked up
by some creep.

15:23.059 --> 15:24.626
I guess this is safer.

15:32.728 --> 15:35.695
So are you married or divorced?

15:36.964 --> 15:38.564
Couldn't I just be single?

15:38.631 --> 15:40.899
no.

15:40.967 --> 15:43.668
I mean I'd be surprised.

15:44.870 --> 15:46.603
I'm divorced.

15:48.239 --> 15:50.974
Do you go on those dates
where you sit there

15:51.041 --> 15:53.842
And ask each other questions?

15:56.712 --> 15:58.746
It's a means to an end.

15:58.814 --> 16:00.647
But nobody knows

16:00.715 --> 16:02.015
What's wrong with themselves...

16:03.684 --> 16:07.920
And everyone else
can see it right away.

16:19.436 --> 16:21.773
thank you very much.

16:21.841 --> 16:23.710
It was my pleasure.

16:23.777 --> 16:26.012
So what time's
your flight tomorrow?

16:26.079 --> 16:28.280
Noon.

16:28.348 --> 16:30.682
Unless you think
I should change it.

16:35.921 --> 16:37.254
What are you doing?

16:38.523 --> 16:40.356
I don't know.

16:42.326 --> 16:45.327
You're so beautiful and young.

16:51.800 --> 16:54.634
Anna and I never had

16:54.702 --> 16:56.703
A romantic relationship.

16:56.770 --> 16:58.337
But you love her.

16:59.806 --> 17:01.672
For lots of reasons...

17:04.608 --> 17:06.575
And in a very different way.

17:08.743 --> 17:10.444
I have to tell you something

17:10.511 --> 17:13.512
And I probably shouldn't.

17:13.579 --> 17:15.714
I promised...

17:17.383 --> 17:18.717
I wouldn't,

17:18.785 --> 17:22.686
But I see you two together

17:22.755 --> 17:24.789
And I know I have to.

17:26.089 --> 17:27.723
Okay.

17:27.790 --> 17:30.058
Anna is...

17:32.894 --> 17:34.861
She has cancer.

17:39.365 --> 17:43.001
- What?
- It's why
she broke her leg.

17:43.069 --> 17:46.171
It's in her bones.
It's all over her body.

17:47.340 --> 17:48.740
I'm sorry.

17:52.178 --> 17:56.350
Cancer. Shit.

17:56.418 --> 17:58.218
I'm so sorry.

17:59.987 --> 18:01.821
Of course she's not
gonna say a damn thing.

18:02.989 --> 18:04.723
She doesn't know.

18:06.126 --> 18:08.995
- What?
- The doctors said

18:09.063 --> 18:12.432
She doesn't have long,
so there's no reason
to tell her.

18:12.499 --> 18:16.202
Some quacks out in Pedro?
What are you going
to do about it?

18:16.270 --> 18:18.604
My mom got a consultation.

18:18.672 --> 18:21.139
Your mother does not
get to decide that.

18:21.207 --> 18:24.408
Please don't make me sorry
that I told you.

18:27.712 --> 18:29.746
I didn't want you to leave here

18:29.814 --> 18:31.547
And not know.

20:34.682 --> 20:36.116
Good morning.

20:36.183 --> 20:37.650
I woke up in a panic

20:37.719 --> 20:39.719
Because I thought
I might've missed you.

20:39.787 --> 20:42.389
But it doesn't look
like you're ready to go.

20:42.456 --> 20:44.991
I thought I'd stay
a little longer
if it's okay.

20:45.059 --> 20:47.293
Hell yes.
Stay as long
as you want.

20:47.361 --> 20:49.461
We'll see.

20:50.796 --> 20:52.962
If I had rolled over on this,

20:53.029 --> 20:55.395
I would've had
to smoke the dress.

21:05.935 --> 21:07.903
How'd you sleep?

21:09.839 --> 21:12.173
I was feeling no pain,
as they say.

21:12.241 --> 21:14.308
In fact, I don't know
if I would've woken up

21:14.376 --> 21:16.210
If I hadn't heard
that jet fly by.

21:16.278 --> 21:18.378
And I thought, "oh my god.
Dick left already."

21:21.415 --> 21:23.716
There's all kinds
of aircraft here, you know.

21:23.784 --> 21:26.552
If we stay up tonight
and we get lucky,

21:26.620 --> 21:29.021
We'll see something
you'll remember.

21:29.089 --> 21:31.790
if we keep smoking that.

21:34.227 --> 21:36.328
I've seen u.F.O.S.

21:36.395 --> 21:38.796
There was a lot going on
during the missile scare,

21:38.864 --> 21:40.665
But it was different.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.800
You saw a u.F.O.?

21:42.868 --> 21:45.568
Mm-hmm. You don't have
to do that, you know.

21:45.636 --> 21:48.204
I want to.

21:48.272 --> 21:50.573
I'm not gonna fight
watching dick Whitman

21:50.640 --> 21:52.541
Paint my living room
in his shorts.

21:57.080 --> 21:59.081
I'm so damn proud of you.

22:01.384 --> 22:03.017
I count on that.

22:04.286 --> 22:08.588
Does that scare you?

22:08.656 --> 22:10.923
The idea
of another civilization
on another planet

22:10.991 --> 22:12.691
Smart enough to find
a way to get here?

22:12.759 --> 22:14.259
It doesn't scare me,

22:15.628 --> 22:17.228
But the odds are against it.

22:17.295 --> 22:19.363
<i>Well, I saw
something once</i>

22:19.431 --> 22:21.832
And I'm telling you
it knocked me sideways.

22:23.734 --> 22:26.035
I started thinking
of everything I was
sure was true

22:28.071 --> 22:30.673
And how flimsy it all might be.

22:30.740 --> 22:32.975
You don't need to see
a u.F.O. To know that.

22:34.677 --> 22:36.677
That's not a great way
to think about things.

22:46.252 --> 22:48.486
<i>I know everything
about you</i>

22:48.554 --> 22:51.155
And I still love you.

22:55.092 --> 22:57.160
Are you just gonna
paint that corner?

22:57.227 --> 22:59.461
'cause a patch
of new paint is just
as bad as a stain.

23:07.168 --> 23:09.636
<i>What the hell
is going on?</i>

23:09.704 --> 23:12.471
- You're gonna get arrested.
- No, you are.

23:12.539 --> 23:14.907
- That's breaking and entering.
- I thought you had
a flight to catch.

23:14.975 --> 23:16.775
I changed my plans.

23:16.843 --> 23:19.845
You just can't keep
your pants on, can you?

23:25.618 --> 23:28.319
You never know what's
gonna set her off.

23:33.992 --> 23:36.794
- I need to talk to you.
- I bet.

23:36.861 --> 23:38.262
I heard you car
pull up at 2:30.

23:38.329 --> 23:41.297
- She's half your age.
- What's your plan?

23:41.365 --> 23:44.666
Just gonna let her
wake up one day in agony
and you tell her it's over?

23:47.703 --> 23:50.538
<i>I'm going to assume
that you've done everything</i>

23:50.606 --> 23:52.840
In your limited means,
but I'm here now.

23:52.908 --> 23:54.575
She's gonna see
some real doctors

23:54.643 --> 23:56.310
And she's not gonna
live in the dark.

23:56.378 --> 23:59.279
We showed the x-rays
to specialists... everybody.

24:00.682 --> 24:03.249
- It's very advanced.
- Specialists?

24:03.317 --> 24:05.885
- You don't think she knows
something's going on?
- She had polio.

24:05.953 --> 24:07.586
She's been going to doctors
since she was eight.

24:07.654 --> 24:09.721
Maybe... I don't know.

24:11.690 --> 24:14.124
She hasn't let on,
so this is the way
it's gonna be.

24:14.192 --> 24:16.860
I understand
you feel guilty,
but don't.

24:16.927 --> 24:19.162
Go to Acapulco.
There's nothing
for you to do here.

24:19.229 --> 24:21.497
<i>She is very
important to me.</i>

24:21.565 --> 24:23.599
I'm gonna do what I have to.

24:23.667 --> 24:26.334
You have no say
in the affairs
of this family.

24:27.769 --> 24:29.369
You're just a man in a room

24:29.437 --> 24:31.104
With a checkbook.
I'm sorry.

24:42.048 --> 24:43.848
Please do the decent thing.

24:45.017 --> 24:46.351
The longer you're here,

24:46.418 --> 24:47.953
The more likely you are
to say something.

24:59.740 --> 25:02.309
She thinks you brought
the pot, I bet.

25:02.377 --> 25:04.144
If it wasn't for my niece,

25:04.212 --> 25:06.247
We'd have killed
each other by now.

25:07.949 --> 25:10.051
She means well
and she's family.

25:10.118 --> 25:11.719
I wouldn't have picked her.

25:12.888 --> 25:14.723
I'm just saying

25:16.258 --> 25:18.260
Not everybody has that.

25:19.595 --> 25:21.230
You have your kids.

25:21.297 --> 25:22.865
I bet that's better.

25:22.932 --> 25:24.933
It's different.

25:32.941 --> 25:35.609
I have to tell you something.

25:35.676 --> 25:37.344
What's wrong?

25:46.486 --> 25:48.119
I have to go.

25:50.756 --> 25:52.557
I'm sorry.

25:57.462 --> 26:00.063
I... I thought
I could stay,
but I can't.

26:00.131 --> 26:01.898
Oh, I don't care.

26:01.966 --> 26:04.001
I want you to.

26:04.068 --> 26:06.703
I want you
to do everything
you want to do.

26:08.873 --> 26:10.607
I'll bring the kids
out at Easter.

26:10.675 --> 26:13.443
We'll go to Catalina,
see the bison.

26:22.685 --> 26:24.152
Acapulco.

26:26.520 --> 26:28.253
Do you think
there's more Mexicans
here or there?

26:34.076 --> 26:35.710
<i>Joan.</i>

26:35.778 --> 26:37.278
Open it.

26:46.953 --> 26:48.053
They're beautiful.

26:50.256 --> 26:53.592
It's so encouraging
to see someone happily
married around here.

26:53.660 --> 26:55.694
Peggy, why don't you go home?

26:55.762 --> 26:58.029
- I'll tell everyone you have
something important to do.
- Really?

26:58.096 --> 26:59.396
- I have to buy a dress.
- Oh.

26:59.464 --> 27:01.198
New year's eve,
big group of girls,

27:01.266 --> 27:04.167
- You'll want to stand out.
- No, I'm spending it with mark.

27:04.234 --> 27:06.535
My boyfriend?

27:06.603 --> 27:07.969
happy new year.

27:10.505 --> 27:11.672
Excuse me.

27:12.942 --> 27:14.275
"darling, I've been an ass.

27:14.343 --> 27:16.011
- Kisses, lane"?
- What?

27:16.079 --> 27:18.449
I am not your darling
and I don't want your kisses.

27:18.517 --> 27:20.686
- What?
- I thought American men
were bad enough,

27:20.754 --> 27:22.922
But none of them has
ever so consistently

27:22.990 --> 27:24.857
Made me feel
like a helpless,
stupid little girl.

27:24.925 --> 27:27.192
Calm down.
I did send you flowers,

27:27.260 --> 27:29.794
But I also sent flowers
to my wife in London.

27:29.861 --> 27:32.162
The sentiments
were very different,
I assure you. Sandy!

27:35.500 --> 27:37.634
Um, is everything okay?

27:37.701 --> 27:39.135
- Yes.
- Just get back to work.

27:39.203 --> 27:40.369
Sandy!

27:42.672 --> 27:45.539
Did it ever occur
to you how sensitive
these deliveries were?

27:45.607 --> 27:47.541
How often do I send flowers?

27:47.608 --> 27:50.276
I ordered the flowers
from Rhinelander's.

27:50.344 --> 27:53.779
They assured me
they were going to contact
your florist in London,

27:53.847 --> 27:56.381
And somehow
they mixed them up.
It's not my fault.

27:56.449 --> 27:58.750
Sandra,
everyone makes mistakes,

27:58.817 --> 28:01.385
But the fact that you're
the kind of person who cannot
accept blame is egregious.

28:04.388 --> 28:06.121
I don't know what that means.

28:06.189 --> 28:08.087
It means I can't believe
I hired you.

28:08.155 --> 28:10.792
<i>You had one simple task.</i>

28:10.859 --> 28:13.761
I don't even know
if I can call to apologize.

28:13.829 --> 28:15.863
What exactly did
Mrs. Harris's note say?

28:15.930 --> 28:20.133
It said, "Joan,
forgive me. Lane."

28:22.369 --> 28:24.070
You're fired.
Go get your things.

28:24.137 --> 28:25.604
You'll be paid through
the end of the year.

28:28.107 --> 28:29.974
Those instructions
you understood!

28:31.210 --> 28:33.244
I'll have Megan clean this up.

28:39.750 --> 28:42.651
- What are you doing?
- You inspired me.

28:44.053 --> 28:45.320
Would you like
to sign your work?

28:46.856 --> 28:48.756
- Really?
- Pick a spot on the wall.

28:55.096 --> 28:57.063
Ah.

28:57.131 --> 28:59.199
You should swim as much
as you can there.

28:59.266 --> 29:01.200
It'll clear your head.

29:01.268 --> 29:02.868
And no cliff diving.

29:21.289 --> 29:24.491
Hey.
You'll be fine.

29:26.294 --> 29:28.128
You'll make the best of it.

29:28.195 --> 29:29.495
You always do.

29:32.899 --> 29:35.467
You know you can call me
if you need anything.

29:45.678 --> 29:47.845
- Goodbye, Anna.
- Goodbye, dick.

29:55.220 --> 29:56.154
<i>Mr. Draper?</i>

29:56.221 --> 29:57.955
Mr. Draper?

30:01.759 --> 30:03.393
Happy new year.

30:04.562 --> 30:06.062
Happy new year.

30:15.036 --> 30:18.272
hey, what are you doing up?

30:18.340 --> 30:20.374
I figured since
we missed it here,

30:20.441 --> 30:22.376
We could celebrate it
in Hawaii.

30:25.246 --> 30:27.680
Oh, look at that.

30:27.748 --> 30:31.683
I'm sorry.
I ate dinner at 3:00.

30:31.751 --> 30:34.185
A bowl of cottage cheese
in the cafeteria?

30:36.821 --> 30:39.756
How about a glass
of fresh-squeezed
orange juice?

30:39.824 --> 30:43.261
Sure. The nurses
spent five minutes

30:43.329 --> 30:45.530
Trying to get this girl's
contact lenses out.

30:45.598 --> 30:47.999
She was screaming.
It turns out

30:48.067 --> 30:50.201
Her friend was the one
with the contact lenses.

30:50.269 --> 30:52.135
Oh! God!

30:53.471 --> 30:55.038
Oh God.

30:55.106 --> 30:56.973
- Let me see.
- I cut it really bad, Greg.

30:57.041 --> 30:57.941
- It really hurts.
- Jesus.

31:01.511 --> 31:03.878
Hold this.

31:05.714 --> 31:07.346
Just take me to the hospital.

31:07.414 --> 31:08.878
Sit down.

31:15.681 --> 31:18.649
- Greg, you don't
have to do this.
- Would you stop?

31:22.787 --> 31:24.754
Isn't there some
medical ethical law

31:24.822 --> 31:27.089
- Against operating
on your wife?

31:37.799 --> 31:39.066
I want you to calm down.

31:39.134 --> 31:43.469
For me, this is like...

31:43.537 --> 31:46.839
I don't know...
filing some papers
is for you.

31:46.907 --> 31:48.173
I do it all the time.

31:48.241 --> 31:50.409
I don't do that anymore.
I have other people do that.

31:50.476 --> 31:52.744
It's really throbbing.
Let me get my coat.

31:52.812 --> 31:56.380
Hey, since when have
we had that bird's
nest on the ceiling?

31:58.083 --> 32:00.884
I usually save that for kids.

32:03.787 --> 32:05.488
Now don't move.

32:08.194 --> 32:10.728
One hillbilly says
to the other,

32:10.796 --> 32:13.597
"you wanna play
20 questions?"

32:15.099 --> 32:18.001
The other hillbilly says,
"what is that?"

32:18.068 --> 32:20.903
He says, "I write something

32:20.971 --> 32:22.972
On a piece of paper,

32:23.040 --> 32:26.174
"And you get 20 questions
to guess what it be."

32:27.777 --> 32:29.511
So he takes out
a piece of paper

32:29.578 --> 32:31.346
And writes "donkey damn" on it.

32:31.413 --> 32:35.416
The other hillbilly takes
a second to think and asks,

32:35.483 --> 32:37.384
"can you eat it?"

32:38.852 --> 32:40.620
The other hillbilly says,

32:40.688 --> 32:42.221
"I might reckon
you could."

32:42.289 --> 32:45.357
The other one says,

32:45.424 --> 32:47.225
"is it donkey damn?"

32:50.562 --> 32:52.463
Cohen told me that.

32:57.401 --> 33:00.370
Aw, come on. It's fine.

33:01.705 --> 33:03.838
I'm not crying 'cause it hurts.

33:03.906 --> 33:05.940
Everything's gonna be okay.

33:06.007 --> 33:07.808
When?

33:11.312 --> 33:12.845
Joanie.

33:20.852 --> 33:23.786
I can't fix anything else,

33:25.055 --> 33:26.856
But I can fix this.

33:44.171 --> 33:46.072
Hello?

33:46.140 --> 33:47.640
<i>Hello?</i>

33:50.543 --> 33:52.776
I thought you were in Acapulco.

33:54.946 --> 33:56.714
I didn't feel like it.

33:56.782 --> 33:58.649
You should be in England
with your family.

33:58.717 --> 34:00.885
Oh, too much to do.

34:00.953 --> 34:02.453
They'll be back soon enough.

34:02.521 --> 34:04.822
I have a sandwich
in the refrigerator.

34:04.890 --> 34:06.257
It's very large.

34:06.324 --> 34:07.825
No thank you.

34:09.628 --> 34:11.194
- Do you mind?
- Help yourself.

34:18.369 --> 34:22.004
<i>- I received something</i>

34:22.071 --> 34:25.907
Rather special
from my father
for my birthday.

34:25.975 --> 34:28.042
- What is it?
- Who knows?

34:30.045 --> 34:31.946
He's one of those alcoholics

34:32.013 --> 34:33.547
Who thinks
that he's collecting.

34:37.184 --> 34:39.051
Chin-chin.

34:45.121 --> 34:47.355
- There's no...
- no bite at all.

34:50.592 --> 34:52.126
<i>- well...</i>

34:55.362 --> 34:57.029
<i>- ...I will let you get back
to your business.</i>

35:00.600 --> 35:03.302
- Ah.
- I made a discovery

35:03.370 --> 35:07.175
As I slowly pulled back
from the records.

35:07.243 --> 35:10.115
I can't take
any more bad news, lane.

35:12.352 --> 35:15.153
Although things are
precarious financially,

35:17.956 --> 35:20.123
It's been a magnificent year.

35:29.598 --> 35:30.832
<i>lane!</i>

35:33.034 --> 35:34.667
what?

35:34.735 --> 35:36.268
<i>Come here.</i>

35:42.608 --> 35:44.409
We're going to the movies.

35:46.112 --> 35:47.847
Do you think we should?

35:47.914 --> 35:49.882
Does howdy doody
have a wooden dick?

35:52.018 --> 35:54.553
"zorba the Greek"...
seen it, but would
see it again.

35:56.355 --> 35:57.922
"it's a mad mad mad world."

35:57.990 --> 35:59.423
No kidding.

36:01.426 --> 36:03.527
- "send me no flowers."
- no.

36:05.629 --> 36:07.129
<i>"the guns of August."</i>

36:07.197 --> 36:10.031
I hate guns and I hate August.

36:12.934 --> 36:14.801
It's all over the rug.

36:14.869 --> 36:16.869
We'll have to smoke the dress.

36:16.937 --> 36:19.605
I don't know that one.

36:21.374 --> 36:23.241
"the umbrellas
of Cherbourg."

36:25.210 --> 36:27.577
Catherine Deneuve.

36:27.645 --> 36:30.712
Apparently it's for
all the young lovers
of the world.

36:37.552 --> 36:40.153
This movie is very good.

36:44.091 --> 36:45.958
You know what's
going on here, don't you?

36:47.460 --> 36:50.795
- Handjobs.
- Is that right?

36:52.964 --> 36:54.831
What percentage do you think?

36:54.899 --> 36:56.432
Do you mind?

36:59.468 --> 37:01.635
Monster!

37:03.840 --> 37:05.909
You like it here.

37:05.977 --> 37:08.577
I do. I do.

37:08.644 --> 37:10.611
Even alone.

37:13.016 --> 37:15.617
You remind me of a chap
I knew in school.

37:16.952 --> 37:19.088
We followed him around
in a pack

37:19.156 --> 37:21.390
And he didn't notice
we were there.

37:23.793 --> 37:25.994
He died in a motorcycle crash.

37:28.630 --> 37:31.532
Mmm.
Rebecca convinced me

37:31.599 --> 37:33.567
That you were all
on holiday together...

37:33.634 --> 37:35.835
Without me.

37:37.137 --> 37:39.571
I suppose we haven't
been very welcoming.

37:39.639 --> 37:41.406
Campbell's friendly,

37:41.474 --> 37:44.542
Although I believe
unintentionally.

37:44.610 --> 37:48.845
But my wife is
quite severe with people,

37:48.913 --> 37:50.380
Including me.

37:52.316 --> 37:53.682
I'm sorry to hear that.

37:55.851 --> 37:57.352
I, um...

37:58.821 --> 38:00.521
I wanted to bring our families

38:00.589 --> 38:02.990
To New York for the holidays,

38:03.058 --> 38:05.425
But she was terribly homesick.

38:06.760 --> 38:08.828
We had an argument...

38:08.895 --> 38:10.929
A series of arguments...

38:10.997 --> 38:13.731
And she left.

38:13.799 --> 38:17.133
I then weakened
and sent her flowers.

38:17.201 --> 38:19.335
Huh.
Tried to, anyway.

38:21.203 --> 38:23.237
Then we had a rather
solemn phone call

38:23.305 --> 38:27.239
In which she told me
she was not returning.

38:31.109 --> 38:33.476
Then she put
my son on the phone.

38:36.812 --> 38:38.279
That's tough.

38:40.348 --> 38:42.783
How did you know
when you were done?

38:44.952 --> 38:46.887
It wasn't my decision.

38:49.257 --> 38:50.726
And I've learned the hard way

38:50.793 --> 38:53.297
Not to give advice
in these situations.

38:55.102 --> 38:57.537
You were
supposed to tell me
to get on a plane.

38:59.273 --> 39:01.307
Is that what you want?

39:01.374 --> 39:03.742
Or is that what
people expect of you?

39:06.579 --> 39:08.913
I want my beef.

39:08.981 --> 39:11.382
Ah. Here it is.

39:19.524 --> 39:22.726
I, uh,

39:22.794 --> 39:25.027
Was going to call
a lady friend of mine.

39:25.095 --> 39:26.561
I'm supposed
to meet her downtown.

39:28.163 --> 39:31.364
Do you want her
to bring a friend?

39:32.800 --> 39:35.301
Oh, no no.
No thank you.

39:35.369 --> 39:36.835
What are you gonna do?

39:38.538 --> 39:40.372
We can pretend it's new year's.

39:40.439 --> 39:42.640
It actually is.

39:51.382 --> 39:53.282
If you don't mind.

39:53.350 --> 39:54.884
It's the least I can do.

40:02.458 --> 40:06.094
- I'm not hungry.
- What? Not hungry

40:06.162 --> 40:08.029
For this...

40:08.097 --> 40:10.765
- Beautiful piece
of American meat?

40:14.970 --> 40:18.739
I got a big Texas belt buckle!

40:18.806 --> 40:21.907
<i>- Yeehaw!</i>

40:24.210 --> 40:27.112
I'm thinking,
"did my mother get suspicious
and call the fuzz?"

40:27.180 --> 40:29.614
"we know you're
practicing self-abuse.

40:29.682 --> 40:31.549
Please come out
with your hand up."

40:36.020 --> 40:39.255
Aw. I see we have
an anniversary
here tonight.

40:42.059 --> 40:44.360
Look at these two...
George and Martha.

40:46.729 --> 40:49.798
Tell me, what's it like
when your eyes meet across
a crowded men's room?

40:52.501 --> 40:55.103
Wall street,
does it bother your parents
that he's so ugly?

40:57.906 --> 41:00.441
At the end of the night

41:00.509 --> 41:02.944
When it's just
the two of you,
who picks up the check?

41:03.011 --> 41:07.114
We're not homosexuals!
We're divorced!

41:07.182 --> 41:08.983
don't.

41:09.051 --> 41:12.487
Oh man. Now they're
gonna fight in the car
all the way home.

41:12.555 --> 41:14.756
"honey, why'd you provoke
the comedian?"

41:17.359 --> 41:20.128
Okay, now welcome
a talented young musician

41:20.195 --> 41:22.830
Whose mother says
he's the next Bob Dylan.

41:24.699 --> 41:27.167
Yeah.

41:31.539 --> 41:33.640
Candice, this is lane.

41:33.708 --> 41:35.042
And this is my friend Janine.

41:35.109 --> 41:36.276
- Hello.
- A pleasure.

41:36.344 --> 41:38.445
I guess I was wrong.
You're not queers.

41:38.513 --> 41:40.981
You're rich.

41:41.048 --> 41:42.649
<i>A warm welcome
for Rudy Jenson.</i>

41:51.926 --> 41:53.994
- You ladies look lovely.
- Why thank you.

41:54.062 --> 41:55.896
It's true.

41:57.832 --> 41:59.132
I love this song.

41:59.199 --> 42:01.000
Really?
He wrote it.

42:01.068 --> 42:02.768
Don't.
She'll believe anything.

42:02.836 --> 42:04.937
<i>- What?</i>

42:05.004 --> 42:06.471
Let's get out of here.

42:13.380 --> 42:15.647
You have no mixers
at all and no food.

42:15.715 --> 42:18.149
I love your apartment.

42:18.216 --> 42:19.850
It's very manly.

42:19.917 --> 42:22.818
It came this way.

42:22.886 --> 42:25.120
I think Norman mailer
shot a deer over there.

42:27.556 --> 42:29.323
I love deer.

42:29.391 --> 42:31.191
Get your tail
in here and help me.

42:37.698 --> 42:40.199
she seems to know her way
around in your kitchen.

42:40.267 --> 42:42.234
What's that like?

42:42.302 --> 42:43.802
I told you I don't like

42:43.870 --> 42:45.237
Giving advice
in these situations.

42:50.242 --> 42:51.809
Why don't you show me around?

42:53.712 --> 42:55.580
I suppose I am
a bit curious myself.

42:59.884 --> 43:01.719
Not in there.

43:57.881 --> 44:00.115
What happened to Acapulco?

44:03.285 --> 44:05.218
She does not go to Barnard.

44:08.394 --> 44:10.197
Guys like him like that.

44:12.373 --> 44:15.111
Come on. Let's go
in the other room.

44:15.179 --> 44:17.849
No. Here.

44:36.930 --> 44:39.164
- Morning.
- Morning.

44:40.632 --> 44:42.699
I'm terribly thirsty.

44:42.766 --> 44:45.101
We'll have coffee in a minute.

44:45.168 --> 44:46.901
Just a glass of water, please.

44:54.407 --> 44:55.841
What do I owe you
for the evening?

44:58.679 --> 45:00.947
- Don't worry about it.
- I should pay.

45:02.249 --> 45:05.050
The girl...
how much was she?

45:05.118 --> 45:06.985
$25.

45:08.754 --> 45:12.321
Fascinating.

45:12.389 --> 45:14.656
Here's $30.

45:23.864 --> 45:26.665
Well, I shall be running along.

45:40.478 --> 45:44.047
<i>Thank you for
the welcome distraction.</i>

46:15.405 --> 46:17.206
sorry.

46:26.950 --> 46:30.451
All right. Gentlemen,
shall we begin 1965?
