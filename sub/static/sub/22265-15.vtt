to open up a

we get Jack, and we get out.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.269
Well, I've been digging
through the lore,

02:16.360 --> 02:17.577
but so far nothing.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.463
Great. So, we got Cass in Syria,

trying to find fruit
from the Tree of Life.

02:24.800 --> 02:27.303
We don't know where Lucifer is,
so we can't get grace from an archangel

of the spell

02:29.440 --> 02:30.657

02:30.960 --> 02:32.939
"Blood of a most holy man."

02:34.840 --> 02:37.400
A most holy man. What... What...
What does that mean?

02:37.560 --> 02:41.018
No idea. I've been thinking, maybe,
blood of a saint.

02:41.160 --> 02:43.060
- A saint?
- Yeah.

02:44.160 --> 02:45.479
Yeah, that should be easy to get.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.297
Well, actually, uh,

02:48.400 --> 02:50.504
turns out, there's a huge market
for religious relics.

Ah. The Internet is not
Just for porn anymore.

03:08.240 --> 03:10.504
Aanay, uh, a lot of this is fake,

03:10.600 --> 03:12.943
obviously, but I...
I did find one dealer

03:13.040 --> 03:14.541
who seems to be legit.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.279
Margaret Astor.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.189
Worth a shot?

03:18.920 --> 03:20.899
Yeah, good. Why not?

03:21.200 --> 03:23.657
I don't think I can take another one
of these cold pieces of Papa Giovanni's.

03:40.600 --> 03:41.589
Miss Astor?

03:42.960 --> 03:44.302
"Ms." will do.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.784
Of course. Great. Uh, may we sit?

03:47.160 --> 03:48.149
Please.

03:53.240 --> 03:54.787
So, gentlemen, what can I do for you?

03:55.640 --> 03:57.744
Okay. We, um... We're interested
in obtaining

03:57.880 --> 04:00.906
a very rare religious artifact

04:01.000 --> 04:04.902
and... And we're told that maybe
you'd be the person to help us out.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.508
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:07.160 --> 04:08.149
Who told you that?

04:08.720 --> 04:09.709
The Internet.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.580
So, this is not
a personal recommendation.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.268
No. Um...

04:16.880 --> 04:18.381
ls... Is that a problem?

04:19.680 --> 04:23.229
Personal relationships
are very important to me.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.103
Right.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.140
Well, um...

04:35.040 --> 04:39.340
I would personally appreciate
any help you could give us.

04:44.720 --> 04:47.939
- What sort of help do you need?
- We need, um...

04:49.440 --> 04:50.907

04:51.640 --> 04:53.744
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:53.840 --> 04:56.058
- Whatever for?
- Does it matter?

04:57.920 --> 04:59.421
I was asking...

05:00.880 --> 05:01.869
Sam.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.389
Sam.

05:11.640 --> 05:14.461
So, Sam, what can you tell me?

05:14.720 --> 05:16.506
Unfortunately, not very much.

05:16.680 --> 05:19.240
Just that it's very,
very important to us.

05:21.040 --> 05:22.029
To me.

05:23.480 --> 05:24.697
Well, of course it is.

05:25.040 --> 05:28.498
Blood of a saint. _
Very rare, very expensrve.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.461
It just so happens
I might know one person

05:32.600 --> 05:34.101
who would have such an item.

05:35.200 --> 05:37.509
- Do I dare give you the name?
- Please.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.940
I would be very much in your debt.

05:45.760 --> 05:47.182
Well, that's lovely.

05:47.920 --> 05:49.023
But know, Sam,

05:50.880 --> 05:52.620
I like to collect on what's owed to me.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.706
His name is Richard Greenstreet.

05:57.520 --> 05:58.657
He lives in Seattle.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.663
I'll provide an introduction,
but that's as far as I'll go.

06:02.240 --> 06:03.821
Perfect. Thank you.

06:04.080 --> 06:05.502
Now, don't thank me yet.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.700
Greenstreet has all the trappings
of a gentleman,

06:08.880 --> 06:12.225
but I would advise caution.

06:14.440 --> 06:15.907
Mmm.

06:16.680 --> 06:17.749
Mmm...

06:20.480 --> 06:22.584
Your names again?

06:22.800 --> 06:25.940
This is Sam, I'm Dean Vaughn.
We're from Rhode Island.

06:26.480 --> 06:29.699
Rhode Island.
My, you are a long way from home.

06:30.440 --> 06:33.546
Do you happen to know the Manchin twins
out of Newport?

06:33.760 --> 06:35.307
The Manchin twins? Uh...

06:35.600 --> 06:38.057
Well, we don't know them personally,
but obviously, we know of them.

06:38.560 --> 06:40.266
Mmm. That's interesting,

06:40.840 --> 06:46.187
because to the best of my knowledge,
there are no Manchin twins from Newport.

06:47.120 --> 06:48.439
So, who are you really?

06:50.280 --> 06:51.861
This is Sam, I'm Dean Winchester.

06:51.960 --> 06:53.860
DEAN: We were told that you might have
something that we need.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.177
What might that be?

06:56.040 --> 06:57.029
Blood of a saint.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.177
The blood of a saint.

07:00.920 --> 07:05.027
Why, yes. I do believe
I possess such an item.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.618
Cost me a small fortune to obtain.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.217
Right. We need some for a worthy cause.

07:10.840 --> 07:12.979
I gave up on worthy causes years ago.

07:13.240 --> 07:15.947
And as I said,
the blood cost me a fortune.

07:16.080 --> 07:20.107
Judging by your Montgomery Ward suits
and your cheap ties,

07:20.200 --> 07:23.306
I'm guessing you don't have
a small fortune

07:23.400 --> 07:26.301
or for that matter,
two nickels to rub together.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.982
So, I'm quite afraid this has been
a waste of your time

07:29.080 --> 07:32.504
and more importantly, mine.

07:35.120 --> 07:36.109
Good day, gentlemen.

07:37.480 --> 07:38.504
Mmm.

07:42.240 --> 07:44.105
Uh... Wait.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.065
I suppose we can be of service
to one another.

07:51.360 --> 07:54.181
Since you had the nerve to come in here
under false pretenses,

07:54.480 --> 07:57.825
I assume you won't be above
a little bit of chicanery. Hmm?

08:00.400 --> 08:01.389
Yes.

08:01.800 --> 08:02.824
We're listening.

08:03.280 --> 08:04.269
Hmm.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.069
Sit.

08:10.280 --> 08:11.599
A short while ago,

08:11.800 --> 08:16.339
a valuable item that I covet was removed
from its ancestral home in Malta.

08:17.040 --> 08:20.919
I believe the thief was working
for a man named Santino Scarpatti.

08:21.680 --> 08:22.783
Scarpatti, the mob boss?

08:22.880 --> 08:24.507
Mmm. You've heard of him.

08:24.760 --> 08:26.580
I've heard enough
to know he kills people.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.023
Oh, yes, I suppose he does.

08:29.640 --> 08:33.417
(SIGHS) In any case,
here is my proposal.

08:33.600 --> 08:38.424
You procure said item for me
and I will trade it for the blood.

08:42.240 --> 08:44.185
And what kind of item is it
that we're talking about?

08:45.040 --> 08:47.417
The skull of St. Peter.

08:51.000 --> 08:51.989
DEAN: Okay.

08:52.280 --> 08:55.545
We steal the skull from the head
of the Seattle mob.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.865
In exchange,
you'll give us the blood of...

09:00.560 --> 09:05.429
St. Ignatius. That's correct.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.580
Yeah, we can do that. No problem.

09:09.840 --> 09:10.943
What else can you tell us?

09:11.240 --> 09:14.300
Rumor has it the skull is supposed
to be turned over tomorrow night.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.539
Unfortunately, I don't know
the name of the thief

09:16.720 --> 09:19.427
_ or where the meet
IS supposed to take place.

09:19.720 --> 09:21.108
That's not a lot to go on.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.217
I have faith.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.464
So, this is what we've come to? Thieves?

09:28.760 --> 09:31.342
Hey, you want the blood, right? Well...

09:31.440 --> 09:32.828
Besides, the thing's already stolen.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.979
(SCOFFS) Really? That's your rationale?

09:35.360 --> 09:36.679
Hey, I'm not perfect.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.780
And by the way, neither are you. Okay?

09:39.040 --> 09:41.679

Now you're above a little "chicanery"?

to save it, then so be it.

- Nice timing. What?

10:24.880 --> 10:26.700

into airline records

10:30.000 --> 10:31.900
in the first three days
after the skull was stolen.

would you?

10:49.040 --> 10:50.905
As a matter of fact, I do.

got to him before we could.

29:54.640 --> 29:56.460
Even with all the complications.

29:57.160 --> 29:59.424
Complications are what I pay you for.

30:00.160 --> 30:01.741
Maybe we should talk about a raise.

30:02.040 --> 30:04.383
No, we really shouldn't.

30:04.920 --> 30:07.946
Mr. Scarpatti, thank you so much
for coming.

30:08.200 --> 30:09.303
What can I say?

30:09.720 --> 30:12.427
When somebody's screwing me,
I like to look into their eye.

30:12.600 --> 30:13.817
- No one's screwing--
- Really?

30:13.960 --> 30:16.178
If it wasn't for me,
that wouldn't even be here, all right?

30:16.280 --> 30:17.781
I already made a deal.

30:17.960 --> 30:19.063
With a dead man.

30:19.240 --> 30:21.026
Well, he wasn't dead at the time.

- Mr. Miele was the competition--
- Yeah, so... So, you killed him.

30:26.640 --> 30:27.823
I cornered the market.

30:28.600 --> 30:29.624
Really?

30:30.360 --> 30:35.297
SO, I... I suppose you don't plan on
honoring his price?

30:35.520 --> 30:36.782
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

30:38.200 --> 30:39.588

You're worried.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.221

31:38.440 --> 31:39.828
God will see us through.

Yeah, he really won't.

some sort of a...

well, (CHUCKLES) good luck.

God would reach down and protect us.

are God's things.

it's a good thing.
