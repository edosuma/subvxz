(male narrator)
Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:08.130 --> 00:12.060
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:12.080 --> 00:16.219
They call themselves Smurfs.
They were good.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
[music continues]

00:22.109 --> 00:26.149
Then, there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard.

00:26.170 --> 00:27.219
He was bad.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.039
Oh, I hate Smurfs!

00:31.059 --> 00:34.000
I'll get you,
I'll get all of you

00:34.020 --> 00:36.100
if it's
the last thing I ever do!

00:36.119 --> 00:38.109
[evil laugh]

00:38.130 --> 00:41.100
[groans]
Oh! I'll get you!

00:41.119 --> 00:44.170
I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry!

00:44.189 --> 00:47.030
(male narrator)
Well, the forest
is still there

00:47.049 --> 00:51.070
and if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:51.090 --> 00:55.060
And if you are good,
you may just catch a glimpse..

00:55.079 --> 00:57.009
...of the Smurfs.

00:59.149 --> 01:01.130
[theme music]

01:05.049 --> 01:06.170
(Hefty)
Smurf to it! We're late!

01:06.189 --> 01:08.210
I hope they didn't
start without us.

01:08.230 --> 01:10.129
[clamoring]

01:12.030 --> 01:16.030
Hey, where you all going?
Don't you want any surprise?

01:18.140 --> 01:20.079
In that case..

01:20.099 --> 01:21.189
[explosion]

01:21.210 --> 01:25.129
I just can't bear to see
a good surprise go to waste.

01:25.150 --> 01:27.079
[laughing]

01:27.099 --> 01:30.039
At last,
we will hear Papa Smurf's new

01:30.060 --> 01:31.219
"Smurphony in C."

01:32.000 --> 01:34.069
I hear it's a beautiful piece.

01:34.090 --> 01:36.090
In that case,
I'll have two pieces.

01:36.109 --> 01:38.170
It's music, Greedy, not food.

01:38.189 --> 01:42.039
Ah, but music
is food for the soul.

01:42.060 --> 01:45.009
Mm. And my soul
will have two pieces too.

01:46.180 --> 01:49.030
[Smurfs cheering]

01:54.020 --> 01:57.060
And now, my "Smurphony in C."

01:57.079 --> 01:58.189
A one, and a two, and..

01:58.210 --> 02:00.180
[Harmony playing off-key]

02:00.200 --> 02:02.209
[all groaning]

02:02.230 --> 02:06.079
Stop, stop!
This will not do!

02:06.099 --> 02:08.020
Didn't you like my playing?

02:08.038 --> 02:10.008
Well, uh, i-it's just that

02:10.030 --> 02:12.069
we can't have
a "Smurphony in C"

02:12.090 --> 02:15.169
with a single musician.
We need other players.

02:15.189 --> 02:17.090
We'd like to help, Papa Smurf.

02:17.110 --> 02:19.050
But we don't have
any instruments.

02:19.069 --> 02:20.150
Then go smurf some.

02:20.170 --> 02:22.229
[clamoring]

02:24.129 --> 02:26.170
Bah! Nothing! Nothing at all.

02:26.189 --> 02:28.159
I've been searching
the forest for years

02:28.180 --> 02:30.110
and I still
can't find the village

02:30.129 --> 02:33.159
of those disgusting
little Smurfs.

02:33.180 --> 02:35.000
[yowls]

02:36.139 --> 02:40.000
But I won't give up.
Right, Azrael? Azrael?

02:40.020 --> 02:42.090
[Azrael whimpering]

02:42.110 --> 02:45.170
Azrael, come down from there!
We have work to do.

03:01.150 --> 03:05.069
Greedy Smurf, why aren't you
making an instrument too?

03:05.090 --> 03:08.060
I am, Papa Smurf.
A kettle drum.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.090
But first, I have
to empty the kettle.

03:12.080 --> 03:14.169
Alright, Smurfs, are we ready?

03:14.189 --> 03:16.139
(all)
'Ready, Papa Smurf.'

03:16.159 --> 03:19.060
Then a one, and a two, and..

03:19.079 --> 03:21.090
[orchestral music]

03:23.129 --> 03:26.050
My smurfness!
They've started without me.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.170
[off-key music]

03:31.009 --> 03:32.050
What's wrong?

03:32.069 --> 03:34.120
I believe you played
an incorrect note.

03:34.139 --> 03:37.000
- 'I did?'
- No problem, Smurfs.

03:37.020 --> 03:40.099
Let's just begin again.
A one, a two, a--

03:40.120 --> 03:42.030
[off-key music]

03:43.050 --> 03:44.090
Now what?

03:44.110 --> 03:46.110
Harmony,
perhaps it's your trumpet.

03:46.129 --> 03:48.219
Yeah! Let me try it.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.170
[trumpet music]

03:50.189 --> 03:54.050
- Hm. It's fine.
- Of course it is.

03:54.069 --> 03:56.139
He might do better
with another instrument.

03:56.159 --> 03:59.229
- Here, try this.
- A snap.

04:00.009 --> 04:01.219
[off-key music]

04:03.090 --> 04:06.129
I have the solution.
A triangle.

04:06.150 --> 04:09.050
[off-key music]

04:09.069 --> 04:13.120
- It's hopeless, Papa Smurf.
- Harmony plays out of tune.

04:13.139 --> 04:17.009
Maybe we could make him
the conductor, huh, Papa Smurf?

04:17.029 --> 04:18.220
Good idea, Smurfette.

04:20.160 --> 04:23.060
And a one, and a two, and a..

04:23.079 --> 04:24.220
[off-key music]

04:25.209 --> 04:27.180
[clamoring]

04:30.100 --> 04:34.009
It's unfair. They're all
just jealous, that's all.

04:34.029 --> 04:35.159
Well, who needs them?

04:35.180 --> 04:38.199
I'll just smurf all by myself.
So there.

04:38.220 --> 04:40.230
[off-key music]

04:41.209 --> 04:43.120
- Yipes!
- Reow!

04:43.139 --> 04:45.209
W-w-what
is that horrible noise?

04:45.230 --> 04:47.170
Uh, could it be thunder?

04:47.189 --> 04:50.199
It sounds like the howl
of a wounded dragon.

04:50.220 --> 04:53.180
Or-or the angry roar
of a giant.

04:56.170 --> 04:58.000
[Gargamel gasps]

04:58.019 --> 04:59.170
[whispers]
It's a Smurf.

04:59.189 --> 05:03.029
The nerve of those Smurfs,
telling me I'm out of tune.

05:03.050 --> 05:06.029
'They'll be sorry they smurfed
me out of the orchestra.'

05:06.050 --> 05:09.209
That's it.
That gives me a brilliant idea.

05:09.230 --> 05:11.170
But I must act fast.

05:13.100 --> 05:14.079
thud

05:14.100 --> 05:15.170
'I have everything I need here.'

05:15.189 --> 05:18.220
And soon,
I'll have those Smurfs too!

05:19.000 --> 05:20.129
[laughs]

05:20.149 --> 05:23.050
I've made up my mind,
I'm going back to the village

05:23.069 --> 05:26.069
and they can beg me to play
in their old Smurphony

05:26.089 --> 05:27.129
but I'll just say--

05:27.149 --> 05:30.009
(Gargamel)
'You'll say yes.'

05:30.029 --> 05:31.069
Who are you?

05:31.089 --> 05:35.120
Oh, have no fear,
I am Aurora, the good..

05:35.139 --> 05:37.019
Oh, I hate that word.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.139
...fairy.

05:38.159 --> 05:42.079
So tell me your fondest wish
and it shall be granted.

05:42.100 --> 05:46.060
I'll help you.
Don't you wish to become a mu?

05:46.079 --> 05:48.060
- Huh?
- Oh, come now, ha-ha.

05:48.079 --> 05:49.129
A musi..

05:49.149 --> 05:51.189
- Huh?
- A musician!

05:51.209 --> 05:54.050
Oh, that. It's no use.

05:54.069 --> 05:56.060
The other Smurfs
don't like my playing.

05:56.079 --> 05:58.220
Ah, but they will now.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.100
With this magic shazalakazoo..

06:02.120 --> 06:04.230
...you will make
beautiful music.

06:05.009 --> 06:07.110
Oh, thank you, good fairy,
ma'am!

06:07.129 --> 06:11.120
Now hurry, go show
your little friends.

06:11.139 --> 06:14.120

Now he'll lead me
right to the Smurf Village.

Hey, wait till you hear this!

06:26.129 --> 06:29.170
- Oh, no!
- Him again.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.089
I hate "Again."

06:31.110 --> 06:34.019
It's called a shazalakazoo

06:34.040 --> 06:36.199
and you'll love it. Listen.

What are you smurfing?

06:43.050 --> 06:45.159
Is this a joke? What happened?

06:45.180 --> 06:47.230
Oh, come on, you can get up now.

06:48.009 --> 06:51.110
Papa Smurf.
Wake up, Papa Smurf. Hey!

06:51.129 --> 06:55.040
This is terrible. I've got
to find that good fairy.

Yoo-hoo. Looking for me?

06:58.060 --> 07:00.069

07:00.089 --> 07:04.149
- Gargamel!
- At long last, revenge is mine!

07:04.170 --> 07:07.019
What have you done
to all the Smurfs?

07:07.040 --> 07:09.189
Who, me? Nothing.
Nothing at all.

07:09.209 --> 07:11.079
You have destroyed them

07:11.100 --> 07:14.019
with your magical
shazalakazoo.

07:14.040 --> 07:16.189
Now I have only
to dispose of..

07:16.209 --> 07:18.089
Yipe!

07:18.110 --> 07:21.009
And not a single Smurf
will be left on Earth.

blue friends, and you are next!

And, and, and..

08:19.209 --> 08:21.079
That was a close smurf.

Now, I'd better get back
to the village.

08:26.079 --> 08:29.069
The horrible little monster
has run like a coward.

08:29.089 --> 08:32.100
Eh, no matter. He's probably
gone back to his village.

08:32.120 --> 08:35.000
And now I know
exactly where it is.

08:35.019 --> 08:36.139

08:36.159 --> 08:39.179
I go straight ahead,
then I turn right..

08:39.200 --> 08:43.058
Or is it left?
Then right again. And again.

08:43.080 --> 08:46.000
Oh, no. Oh, no!
I've lost the trail.

of this smurfity-smurf!

Wait a minute, since this spell
came from Gargamel

09:14.029 --> 09:16.149
I'll bet he has
the cure for it too.

to cheer you up, Mr. Gargamel?

No, no! Please! Please don't!
No, I beg you!

I'm going to play
a final salute in your honor.

11:44.190 --> 11:46.080
[off-key music]

11:46.100 --> 11:49.129
- 'Oh! Stop!'
- 'You.. You're awake!'

11:49.149 --> 11:53.049
And how! You're racket
is enough to smurf the dead.

11:53.070 --> 11:56.139
But.. But..
But then, I found the cure.

11:56.159 --> 11:58.039
[off-key music]

11:58.059 --> 11:59.159
[yawns]

11:59.179 --> 12:04.019
- Uh, what happened?
- It's a long story, Papa Smurf.

12:04.039 --> 12:06.019
And it all started when..

12:07.090 --> 12:10.100
And Gargamel pretended
he was a good fairy?

12:10.120 --> 12:12.039
- Yep.
- Oh, Harmony.

12:12.059 --> 12:15.049
We owe you a lot. Mwah!

12:15.070 --> 12:18.129
So, all is smurfy
that ends smurfy.

12:18.149 --> 12:20.110
Now, we can resume
our performance

12:20.129 --> 12:22.110
of the "Smurphony in C."

12:22.129 --> 12:25.000
Great,
my horn's all warmed up.

12:25.019 --> 12:27.049
[clamoring]

12:27.070 --> 12:29.129
You will let me play,
won't you?

12:29.149 --> 12:32.059
- Well, um--
- In a manner of speaking.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.159
Well, that is, we, um--

12:33.179 --> 12:35.080
We certainly can't refuse him

12:35.100 --> 12:38.080
after all he's done. Can we?

12:38.100 --> 12:39.200
Papa Smurf, why don't we..

12:39.220 --> 12:41.200
[indistinct whispering]

12:41.220 --> 12:44.179
Handy, that's a fine idea.

12:44.200 --> 12:47.110
[off-key music]

12:47.129 --> 12:50.019
[orchestral music]

12:58.059 --> 13:00.070
[theme music]
