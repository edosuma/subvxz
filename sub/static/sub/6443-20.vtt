<i>I need help now!</i>

00:08.868 --> 00:12.573
Please, you have to help us.
No, no, it isn't enough time.

00:13.726 --> 00:16.231
What the hell's the matter
with you people? This is an emergency!

00:16.239 --> 00:18.409
It's too late. It's too late.

00:19.429 --> 00:20.891
It's coming!

00:28.161 --> 00:31.213
Oh, god.
What's happening to me?

00:39.089 --> 00:40.486
I'm sorry!

00:41.228 --> 00:44.471
No! No, don't leave me, please!

Are you all right?

01:00.469 --> 01:01.342
Yeah, what was that?

01:01.361 --> 01:02.144
I don't know.

01:02.775 --> 01:04.563
I think it came from Evans field.

01:22.298 --> 01:23.651
Oh, my god.

01:25.030 --> 01:26.592
Lana, wait. Lana!

Season 4 Episode 20

02:05.470 --> 02:07.970
Original Airdate May 4, 2005

02:54.916 --> 02:57.870
Last time I checked, babies don't just
fall out of the sky, Mr. Kent.

02:57.898 --> 02:59.938
It left a 30-foot crater, sheriff.

02:59.985 --> 03:01.185
How else would you explain it?

03:01.206 --> 03:02.805
Well, I can't. That's
why we're conducting

03:02.831 --> 03:04.441
a little something
called an investigation.

03:04.450 --> 03:06.164
What's gonna happen
to the baby now, sheriff?

03:06.199 --> 03:08.464
Well, he'll be placed
with child services

03:08.490 --> 03:10.422
until we can find
a home for him.

03:12.471 --> 03:14.561
You did good for a change, Mr. Kent.

03:15.571 --> 03:18.002
The little critter wouldn't
be alive if not for you.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.229
Dad,

03:23.144 --> 03:24.624
this baby's parents...

03:25.094 --> 03:26.935
I don't think they're from around here.

03:30.869 --> 03:32.559
What do you mean?
You think the baby's...

03:33.475 --> 03:34.732
the baby's not from earth?

03:34.767 --> 03:37.172
We found him in a crater,
just like you and mom found me.

03:38.147 --> 03:41.035
Yeah, but when we found you,
we also found a spaceship.

03:42.937 --> 03:45.436
The truth is, we don't know
what happened on that field.

03:53.997 --> 03:54.902
Hi.

03:55.864 --> 03:56.663
Hi.

03:57.273 --> 03:59.011
I've tried everything,
but he won't stop.

03:59.035 --> 03:59.915
Is he okay?

04:00.021 --> 04:02.165
If you can believe it, all
his crying is a good sign.

04:02.191 --> 04:03.778
The doctor said he's
perfectly healthy.

04:03.964 --> 04:05.533
I'm gonna go talk
to the nurses,

04:05.559 --> 04:07.531
find out if we can get
some more formula.

04:07.578 --> 04:08.987
Clark, you take over.

04:09.011 --> 04:10.232
- Me?
- Yeah.

04:10.267 --> 04:11.958
Well, I, Lana...

04:12.357 --> 04:14.022
I don't really...

04:21.060 --> 04:21.894
Wow,

04:22.124 --> 04:24.637
looks like someone has
the magic touch.

04:28.318 --> 04:29.668
I'll be right back.

04:31.148 --> 04:32.040
Uh...

04:32.475 --> 04:35.070
when does child services
come and take him?

04:35.117 --> 04:36.021
They're not.

04:36.255 --> 04:38.108
They don't have room for him yet, so

04:38.155 --> 04:40.257
he's going to stay
in the hospital until they do.

04:40.668 --> 04:42.452
Well, he can't stay in the hospital.

04:42.722 --> 04:43.732
I mean, he...

04:45.681 --> 04:47.501
maybe he can come stay with us.

04:50.366 --> 04:51.892
Until they find room for him.

05:03.175 --> 05:05.488
I found an arrowhead
in Evans field once,

05:05.512 --> 05:07.177
but never a baby in a crater.

05:07.212 --> 05:08.457
It's really weird.

05:08.903 --> 05:12.191
But what's even weirder
is the way Clark is with him.

05:12.214 --> 05:14.821
Let me guess...
he's completely baby-phobic.

05:14.844 --> 05:17.049
Actually, exactly the opposite.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.646
You should see the look in his eyes
when he's holding that baby.

05:19.693 --> 05:21.852
It's like he's completely at ease,

05:22.133 --> 05:23.331
not to mention

05:23.378 --> 05:25.973
he's a natural born baby burper.

05:26.478 --> 05:28.660
I've got the spit-up stains to prove it.

05:28.812 --> 05:30.861
Sorry I'm late. I was up all night
with the crying machine

05:30.885 --> 05:32.845
and every time I put him down,
he starts up again.

05:32.851 --> 05:35.059
Well, if you need any help,
I could come over tonight.

05:35.106 --> 05:36.200
Well, that would be great.

05:36.226 --> 05:38.051
Could you pick up some
formula on the way?

05:38.086 --> 05:39.812
Sure. How are you on diapers?

05:39.836 --> 05:41.367
The diapers... pretty good.

05:41.414 --> 05:42.207
Okay,

05:42.271 --> 05:44.490
before you guys start
picking out the schools...

05:44.500 --> 05:46.871
for the little tyke, you
might wanna hear this.

05:47.496 --> 05:50.681
I had my contact at emergency
services run a check of all

05:50.713 --> 05:53.505
the 911 calls made around the time
that you found the baby.

05:53.541 --> 05:55.959
This one kinda stuck out.

05:56.662 --> 05:59.316
<i>What the hell's the matter
with you people? It's an emergency!</i>

05:59.351 --> 06:02.234
<i>It's too late!
It's coming! It's coming! Aah!</i>

06:02.284 --> 06:04.198
She sounds so scared.

06:04.245 --> 06:06.999
<i>No! No, don't leave me, please!</i>

06:08.495 --> 06:10.984
Did he just leave her there?

06:11.231 --> 06:13.342
If he did, he might still be alive.

06:13.847 --> 06:16.325
From the sounds of this,
the mother wasn't as lucky.

06:22.435 --> 06:24.760
She didn't even get to see her own baby.

06:26.157 --> 06:28.869
But the baby survived.
How is that possible?

06:28.905 --> 06:30.965
Can you trace this call back
to the cell phone?

06:31.012 --> 06:32.151
I can try.

06:32.620 --> 06:35.110
If this is the father, he might
have some answers for us.

06:45.816 --> 06:46.696
Genevieve.

06:48.223 --> 06:51.663
You know, I'm not accustomed
to being summoned like a lapdog.

06:52.873 --> 06:54.798
Don't be silly, Lionel.

06:55.186 --> 06:56.816
I'd never allow you on my lap.

06:59.645 --> 07:02.856
So, uh, why am I here,
if not for the, uh,

07:03.494 --> 07:05.032
pleasure of your company?

07:05.780 --> 07:08.175
It's time to repay old debts, Lionel.

07:08.328 --> 07:13.750
Arranging your release from maximum
security prison was not an easy task.

07:16.028 --> 07:18.694
And I have yet to receive
even a hint of gratitude.

07:19.470 --> 07:21.995
Well, I've been
racking my brain

07:22.015 --> 07:24.065
trying to write a
thank-you note, but, uh,

07:24.090 --> 07:27.154
words could never express the way I feel.

07:29.274 --> 07:33.290
Your son just returned from China
with a lost element.

07:33.713 --> 07:35.756
And I would like you to retrieve it for me.

07:35.779 --> 07:37.972
No, no, you have the wrong son in mind.

07:38.019 --> 07:40.591
It was Jason who brought
the stone back home.

07:40.849 --> 07:43.843
Jason's incapable of such subterfuge.

07:44.242 --> 07:47.229
Unfortunately, he inherited his intelligence

07:47.264 --> 07:49.448
from my husband's side of the family.

07:49.483 --> 07:52.771
Yeah, I never thought you married well.

07:53.182 --> 07:54.920
Lex, on the other hand,

07:55.084 --> 07:56.951
received his genes from a

07:57.005 --> 07:59.389
far more cunning source.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.123
You know, there were other treasure
seekers in China, Genevieve.

08:03.779 --> 08:04.436
Ha.

08:05.515 --> 08:07.253
A farmboy,

08:07.558 --> 08:09.449
an ex-cheerleader,

08:10.142 --> 08:11.513
and Lex Luthor.

08:11.983 --> 08:14.226
Who do you think ended up
with the prize?

08:14.284 --> 08:15.071
Well,

08:15.506 --> 08:18.406
my son hasn't been
listening to me for years.

08:19.909 --> 08:22.581
What do you want me to do,
give him a good spanking?

08:26.150 --> 08:27.442
You know, Lionel,

08:28.053 --> 08:31.867
I don't think either one of us
want me to go after Lex myself.

08:34.426 --> 08:36.129
You be careful, Genevieve.

08:36.467 --> 08:40.400
I regard a threat to any Luthor
as a threat to me.

08:41.092 --> 08:42.995
Interpret it any way you like.

08:44.897 --> 08:46.441
I want that stone,

08:47.205 --> 08:48.156
Lionel.

09:02.791 --> 09:04.329
What's the matter?

09:04.376 --> 09:06.763
What's the matter, little guy?
Is your milk too cold? Huh?

09:13.601 --> 09:14.508
Here, try this.

09:14.636 --> 09:16.618
Try this, try this, try this.

09:16.677 --> 09:17.358
Huh?

09:17.687 --> 09:18.427
Yeah?

09:18.650 --> 09:20.939
There you go.
There you go.

09:20.975 --> 09:23.042
Clark, I could easily get
Chelsea to cover for me

09:23.077 --> 09:24.824
at the talon.
You don't have to stay home.

09:24.859 --> 09:26.659
That's okay.
I want to stay with him.

09:26.674 --> 09:27.330
Okay.

09:28.218 --> 09:30.084
It kind of changes your perspective

09:30.108 --> 09:32.079
when you have someone who
depends on you for everything.

09:32.126 --> 09:32.807
Yeah.

09:33.158 --> 09:34.885
And I mean everything.

09:35.996 --> 09:37.359
Could you hand me a diaper?

09:37.380 --> 09:38.689
Here you go.

09:39.213 --> 09:40.883
Well, listen, you have
my number at the talon,

09:40.909 --> 09:42.588
and your dad's out in the
barn if you need him.

09:42.603 --> 09:43.507
- Okay.
- Okay?

09:43.642 --> 09:44.787
Have fun.

09:44.810 --> 09:45.433
Yeah.

09:49.612 --> 09:50.269
Okay.

09:56.938 --> 10:00.102
Clark Kent, changing diapers like a pro.

10:01.985 --> 10:04.380
You know, all this baby stuff
is easier than people say.

10:04.415 --> 10:06.423
I think I pretty much
got it under control.

10:08.641 --> 10:09.346
Oh...

10:11.600 --> 10:13.009
Nice aim, little guy.

10:13.678 --> 10:15.663
Clark, we can't keep
calling him "little guy."

10:15.700 --> 10:18.031
They're gonna make fun of him
when he gets to high school.

10:18.050 --> 10:19.259
Well, um...

10:20.110 --> 10:21.883
we found him in Evans field.

10:22.470 --> 10:23.841
Why don't we call him Evan?

10:25.027 --> 10:26.636
I think he likes it.

10:27.728 --> 10:28.902
Hello, Evan.

10:29.066 --> 10:31.356
This is Clark, and I'm Lana.

10:31.767 --> 10:35.062
And we think that you're
the most beautiful baby ever.

10:36.694 --> 10:39.007
You know, Lana, maybe we should take a step back.

10:39.489 --> 10:41.062
Step back from what?

10:42.433 --> 10:44.958
Well, maybe we shouldn't
get so attached.

10:48.774 --> 10:50.312
I mean, if his father's still alive...

10:50.347 --> 10:52.564
then he never should've
left him in that field.

10:52.881 --> 10:54.478
Lana, we don't know what happened.

10:54.655 --> 10:57.200
He could've gone for help.
He could be looking for Evan right now.

10:57.214 --> 10:58.646
Or maybe he isn't.

11:00.042 --> 11:03.142
Maybe Evan is an orphan,
just like we were.

11:05.396 --> 11:07.862
Clark, things like this don't just happen.

11:08.085 --> 11:11.572
There's a reason he survived
and that someone like you found him.

11:13.460 --> 11:14.517
We found him.

11:20.669 --> 11:21.550
Evan?

11:26.552 --> 11:28.255
Clark, what's happening?

11:34.739 --> 11:35.737
Clark, wha...

11:42.172 --> 11:43.416
my god.

11:59.846 --> 12:01.243
What are you doing, son?

12:01.959 --> 12:05.764
An exciting new venture,
something worthy of a captain of industry?

12:05.799 --> 12:08.469
I'm simply continuing
where you left off, dad.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.947
I, uh, can't talk now.

12:11.252 --> 12:12.027
Well,

12:12.168 --> 12:13.471
we better talk.

12:14.046 --> 12:17.553
Genevieve Teague thinks
you have the missing element.

12:19.996 --> 12:21.323
The one from China.

12:23.894 --> 12:25.139
Come on, dad.

12:25.820 --> 12:28.232
You've raised me
to be smarter than that.

12:29.687 --> 12:31.587
Why use Genevieve
Teague as a threat?

12:31.613 --> 12:33.963
Why not just come out and
ask for it yourself?

12:34.302 --> 12:38.230
I'm here as a father who's concerned
about the safety of his son.

12:41.279 --> 12:44.854
She had Bridgette Crosby murdered
because of one of those elements.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.273
You think she'd hesitate
to do the same to you?

12:49.344 --> 12:50.483
I don't have it.

12:53.172 --> 12:56.340
And even if I did,
I'd never trust you.

12:59.005 --> 12:59.663
Lex...

13:00.990 --> 13:03.947
we haven't a lot of time
left to spend together.

13:05.637 --> 13:09.078
You can go on for the rest of your life
being mistrustful of me,

13:09.853 --> 13:12.453
or you can accept me
as your father

13:12.747 --> 13:13.968
who loves you.

13:23.320 --> 13:25.703
She's dangerous, Lex.
She...

13:27.922 --> 13:29.601
watch your back, son.

13:30.365 --> 13:31.901
I always do.

13:47.220 --> 13:48.734
Where is Evan now?

13:48.770 --> 13:50.541
In the loft with Lana.

13:50.576 --> 13:52.276
And, mom, I've never
seen anything like it.

13:52.356 --> 13:53.630
Last night, he
was just a baby.

13:53.635 --> 13:55.537
His growth spurt was really amazing.

13:55.613 --> 13:57.175
And frightening.

13:57.210 --> 13:59.286
Evan needs to be seen by a doctor.

13:59.403 --> 14:01.446
We have to take him back
to the hospital.

14:01.475 --> 14:02.700
What are we gonna
tell the doctors...

14:02.725 --> 14:04.351
he's some second-generation
meteor freak?

14:04.699 --> 14:06.092
He'll either wind
up in Belle Reve

14:06.110 --> 14:07.565
or a laboratory for
the rest of his life.

14:07.578 --> 14:10.044
I don't know, Clark, but we
owe it to him to do something.

14:10.367 --> 14:12.273
I was thinking we'd
take him to someone who

14:12.499 --> 14:14.265
has experience in the
effects of meteor rock.

14:14.300 --> 14:15.146
Clark,

14:15.555 --> 14:18.114
I realize that Lex
has helped us in the past,

14:18.455 --> 14:21.684
but there's no way that I'm about to put
this young man's life in his hands.

14:21.719 --> 14:22.975
If I were in trouble,

14:23.116 --> 14:25.007
and Lex was the only one
who could help,

14:25.484 --> 14:26.600
what would you do?

14:33.175 --> 14:34.960
"You must be very kind to him,

14:35.171 --> 14:38.092
to teach him all he needs
to know in rabbit land.

14:38.139 --> 14:41.063
For he is going to live with us
forever and ever."

14:43.811 --> 14:46.110
You know how to read?

14:46.650 --> 14:49.738
I've read all of Clark's books.
But this is my favorite.

14:49.985 --> 14:52.063
I also liked the encyclopedia.

14:52.474 --> 14:56.335
The encyclopedia, huh?
That's a pretty long book.

14:56.675 --> 14:58.906
I know. I stopped on "W."

14:58.977 --> 15:01.877
Windmills. Did you know they
were invented in Persia?

15:05.317 --> 15:07.572
Why are you looking
at me like that?

15:07.818 --> 15:08.746
Um...

15:11.094 --> 15:14.502
you are a very,
very special boy, Evan.

15:14.747 --> 15:18.258
I think that you are the most special
little boy that I have ever met.

15:18.845 --> 15:19.643
Really?

15:19.855 --> 15:20.700
Yeah.

15:21.064 --> 15:22.661
And you're really lucky,

15:23.024 --> 15:25.878
because there are so many more
books for you to read

15:25.913 --> 15:28.090
and so many places
for you to see.

15:28.137 --> 15:29.253
Like what?

15:29.441 --> 15:31.002
Like a real windmill.

15:31.448 --> 15:33.453
And when you stand
up on top of it,

15:33.479 --> 15:35.818
the whole world stretches
out around you.

15:36.145 --> 15:38.491
Can we go right now?

15:39.019 --> 15:40.088
Where are you going?

15:41.588 --> 15:42.551
Dad!

15:42.574 --> 15:45.745
Mom's taking me to see a real windmill.
Wanna come?

15:46.038 --> 15:46.825
Um...

15:48.187 --> 15:48.985
Evan...

15:50.946 --> 15:51.815
listen...

15:54.245 --> 15:56.088
we're not your real parents.

15:56.546 --> 15:58.942
Everyone's supposed to have
a mother and father.

15:59.153 --> 16:00.700
And they're supposed
to love each other

16:00.705 --> 16:02.433
very much, just
like you and Lana.

16:08.248 --> 16:10.702
Clark and I care
about you a lot, Evan.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.097
That's what matters.

16:12.801 --> 16:14.398
If you're not my mom and dad,

16:15.854 --> 16:17.075
where are they?

16:20.140 --> 16:21.723
We don't know, but...

16:21.911 --> 16:23.378
wherever they are,

16:24.259 --> 16:26.525
I'm sure they love you very much.

16:31.129 --> 16:32.502
You wanna go for a ride in the truck?

16:32.538 --> 16:34.369
Are we going to the windmill?

16:35.132 --> 16:38.561
Uh... we will, but first, I want to
take you to meet a friend of mine.

17:06.212 --> 17:07.891
I hope I've done the right thing.

17:11.695 --> 17:13.386
Clark, he looks really scared.

17:14.270 --> 17:16.054
I just hope it'll be over soon.

17:16.336 --> 17:19.201
Lex has his top scientists trying
to figure out what's happening.

17:20.317 --> 17:23.123
And they've already come up
with some intriguing discoveries.

17:23.414 --> 17:25.352
Lex, is he gonna be all right?

17:27.523 --> 17:28.686
Tell us what's happening.

17:29.365 --> 17:31.901
Well, the results are only
preliminary, but...

17:32.277 --> 17:35.353
the data indicates that
Evan's body is storing energy,

17:35.377 --> 17:37.077
like a battery charging.

17:37.112 --> 17:38.686
Charging for what?

17:39.191 --> 17:42.842
The theory we're working on is that
once enough energy is stored, it's

17:42.878 --> 17:46.148
expended to fuel a burst
of rapid cell division.

17:46.184 --> 17:48.978
That's how he was able to go from
a baby to a 7-year-old in one day.

17:49.013 --> 17:50.552
Is there any way to stop it?

17:50.786 --> 17:53.311
My team believes a bone marrow
transplant might slow the growth

17:53.346 --> 17:55.307
and bring his metabolism
back to normal.

17:55.377 --> 17:57.148
Can we use my bone marrow?

17:57.218 --> 17:59.097
We're willing to do
anything to help.

18:00.670 --> 18:02.232
Well, it's not that simple.

18:02.455 --> 18:04.909
His genetic makeup is highly unusual.

18:05.312 --> 18:07.406
For this to work, we'll
need an exact match

18:07.432 --> 18:08.976
with a living
donor, which means

18:09.011 --> 18:10.584
a biological parent.

18:11.477 --> 18:13.825
Well, we think his mother died
when he was born.

18:13.858 --> 18:15.643
We're still trying to find his father.

18:17.063 --> 18:19.470
What's going to happen
to Evan if we can't?

18:30.295 --> 18:30.988
Evan!

18:34.214 --> 18:34.883
Evan.

18:39.052 --> 18:40.320
Unbelievable.

18:43.875 --> 18:45.838
What's wrong with me?

18:47.656 --> 18:50.262
Prep the level 3 facility.
I want him transferred immediately.

18:50.286 --> 18:52.176
No. You're not
taking him anywhere.

18:52.599 --> 18:55.086
Clark, we need to isolate him
while we run more tests.

18:55.391 --> 18:56.671
I just want to go home.

18:56.706 --> 18:58.421
Lex, he's just a boy.

18:58.526 --> 19:01.271
We understand you're trying to help,
and we appreciate it.

19:01.330 --> 19:03.760
He's been through enough.
We're taking him home.

19:23.378 --> 19:24.763
I'm dying, aren't I?

19:25.515 --> 19:27.429
Evan, don't say that.

19:29.875 --> 19:31.495
I- I read the average

19:31.530 --> 19:33.935
life span of a man is 74 years.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.655
I've aged from a newborn
to a teenager

19:38.816 --> 19:40.085
in 48 hours.

19:43.020 --> 19:44.042
Do the math.

19:44.605 --> 19:46.155
Evan, we're not gonna give up.

19:46.754 --> 19:48.790
Lex has got his team working
on a cure right now.

19:48.837 --> 19:50.157
And if we can find your father...

19:50.162 --> 19:52.642
do you really think they're gonna
find a cure for me overnight?

19:56.514 --> 19:59.402
It's like my life was just some sort
of trick that was played on me.

20:00.471 --> 20:03.841
All that stuff I read in the books
that I thought I was gonna see...

20:05.356 --> 20:06.283
I'm not...

20:10.346 --> 20:11.166
am I?

20:11.835 --> 20:13.490
Don't talk like that, all right?

20:13.725 --> 20:15.357
We just have to keep trying.

20:17.917 --> 20:18.997
It's not fair.

20:22.863 --> 20:25.094
This whole thing... it's just not fair!

20:30.859 --> 20:34.381
Clark, we have to do something.
We can't just let this happen to him.

20:35.790 --> 20:37.563
Would you go see if he's okay?

20:39.055 --> 20:40.640
I need to find his father.

20:58.013 --> 21:00.092
So our friendly phone
company just got friendlier.

21:00.125 --> 21:03.330
I was able to trace the 911
call back to a cell phone.

21:03.366 --> 21:06.630
His mother was Karen Gallagher.
She was a senior here.

21:06.806 --> 21:09.413
I remember hearing about her.
Was she wall of weird material?

21:09.460 --> 21:13.017
I got a couple blips on the radar
when I heard that she...

21:13.040 --> 21:14.567
had a knack for
shorting monitors when

21:14.593 --> 21:16.094
ever she walked into
the computer lab,

21:16.140 --> 21:18.156
but I had no idea that
super-fast pregnancy

21:18.182 --> 21:19.668
powers was part
of the equation.

21:19.703 --> 21:21.053
How long was she pregnant for?

21:22.028 --> 21:25.363
Well, last weekend, Christina Varrano
had a party at her house,

21:25.398 --> 21:30.223
and Karen apparently went NC-17
with some guy in the bedroom.

21:30.340 --> 21:32.242
Christina has no idea
who the guy was.

21:32.266 --> 21:35.260
So she got pregnant and
delivered a baby a week later?

21:39.007 --> 21:40.722
We need to find Evan's father.

21:43.199 --> 21:44.186
Okay.

21:45.125 --> 21:46.111
Well,

21:46.780 --> 21:49.645
Christina used e-vite
to send out all her invitations.

21:49.678 --> 21:52.261
I guess ours got lost
in the electronic mail.

21:52.378 --> 21:55.408
Let's just check all the RSVP's
and try to track him down.

22:03.698 --> 22:06.363
Excuse me. Does Tanner
Sutherland work here?

22:06.575 --> 22:07.853
Yeah, he's over there.

22:09.931 --> 22:10.706
Thank you.

22:12.854 --> 22:13.794
Tanner?

22:13.853 --> 22:16.154
Leave your car around
back, I'll get to it.

22:19.471 --> 22:21.901
Hey, were you at Christina
Varrano's party last week?

22:25.400 --> 22:27.244
Uh, I don't remember.

22:29.998 --> 22:31.372
I think I was working.

22:32.910 --> 22:34.836
So you didn't hook up
with Karen Gallagher?

22:36.222 --> 22:37.537
What do you want?

22:38.124 --> 22:39.366
Who the hell are you?

22:39.495 --> 22:41.186
I'm the guy who found your son,

22:42.008 --> 22:43.629
laying in the middle of a field.

22:45.014 --> 22:46.998
Look, dude, I don't have a son, and...

22:47.045 --> 22:49.065
I don't know what you're
talking about, all right?

22:49.075 --> 22:50.500
I got work to do.

22:50.515 --> 22:52.415
I'm not going to let you
walk away from this.

22:52.420 --> 22:53.525
You have a responsibility.

22:53.583 --> 22:55.421
Get off me, man.
What's your problem?

22:55.479 --> 22:57.663
My problem is your son needs your help.

23:00.204 --> 23:01.777
Now tell me how he got
on that field.

23:06.990 --> 23:08.514
I got with this girl

23:08.702 --> 23:09.723
at a party.

23:11.614 --> 23:13.727
The next day, she calls me up, crying,

23:13.763 --> 23:16.099
saying she's... she's pregnant.

23:18.268 --> 23:20.534
I go over, and her stomach...

23:20.569 --> 23:22.025
it was already...

23:26.534 --> 23:28.640
a week later, we were in my car,

23:28.828 --> 23:30.425
we're speeding to the hospital

23:30.460 --> 23:33.806
and she's screaming, "it's coming!"
And she starts glowing.

23:33.853 --> 23:36.578
And then the car it went
up like a freakin' a-bomb.

23:39.854 --> 23:41.239
That wasn't a baby.

23:41.979 --> 23:43.740
It was some kind of monster.

23:45.302 --> 23:47.357
He's a human being, Tanner,

23:47.662 --> 23:49.118
and he's your son.

23:49.235 --> 23:50.635
He's aging rapidly.

23:51.469 --> 23:52.737
He needs your help.

23:53.512 --> 23:55.012
He needs a bone
marrow transplant.

23:55.025 --> 23:56.050
You're the only one
who can help him.

23:56.054 --> 23:56.935
What?

23:57.434 --> 23:58.244
No.

24:00.583 --> 24:02.473
Look, I can't deal with this.

24:03.177 --> 24:04.258
I'm sorry.

24:04.704 --> 24:05.702
I can't.

24:17.447 --> 24:19.466
How could someone do
that to their own son?

24:19.502 --> 24:20.194
Clark,

24:20.593 --> 24:23.062
being a father is an
enormous responsibility.

24:23.097 --> 24:24.729
The kid is just too young
to handle it.

24:24.753 --> 24:27.970
He's Evan's only hope, and Evan's going
to die if we can't convince him to help.

24:28.005 --> 24:30.389
I know that, son, and we're
gonna figure it out.

24:30.894 --> 24:33.428
But what's more important right now
is what are we gonna tell Evan?

24:33.451 --> 24:35.894
Maybe it's best I don't even
tell him I found his father.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.066
He's gonna take it pretty hard.

24:38.218 --> 24:39.040
Son,

24:39.287 --> 24:41.903
an orphaned child has every right
to know about his origins.

24:41.938 --> 24:44.099
You should know that
better than anybody.

24:44.627 --> 24:45.778
I'll tell you what...

24:45.825 --> 24:48.267
I'll talk to him, okay?
I mean, I do have a little

24:48.302 --> 24:50.064
experience in that department.

24:50.096 --> 24:51.963
Thanks, dad, but I think I should tell him.

24:51.987 --> 24:53.055
Tell him what?

24:55.204 --> 24:56.765
Did you find my father?

24:59.313 --> 25:00.652
Clark, where is he?

25:03.418 --> 25:05.120
He works downtown...

25:06.659 --> 25:09.524
at Massey's auto garage.
His name's Tanner Sutherland.

25:10.792 --> 25:12.120
When can I see him?

25:13.248 --> 25:14.856
Look, Evan, um,

25:15.267 --> 25:17.287
sometimes, when you

25:17.615 --> 25:20.927
meet your biological father,
it can be painful.

25:21.554 --> 25:22.446
Why?

25:24.395 --> 25:25.616
I don't understand.

25:28.047 --> 25:30.784
They don't always live up
to your expectations, Evan.

25:31.112 --> 25:32.428
Trust me, I know.

25:32.921 --> 25:34.248
But I want to see him.

25:34.565 --> 25:36.103
Evan, we're just
trying to protect you.

25:36.138 --> 25:37.700
You can't protect me.

25:37.791 --> 25:38.954
No one can.

25:38.989 --> 25:40.175
Just calm down, okay?

25:40.198 --> 25:42.054
Stop telling me what to do, Clark.

25:43.146 --> 25:44.625
You're not my father.

25:46.786 --> 25:48.124
- Evan!
- Clark.

25:57.248 --> 25:59.324
Is there any possibility of an error?

25:59.489 --> 26:01.649
We've run the projections three times.

26:02.460 --> 26:03.141
Lex,

26:03.445 --> 26:04.820
I found Evan's father.

26:05.991 --> 26:06.724
Where is he?

26:06.750 --> 26:09.185
He's here in Smallville,
but he doesn't want to help.

26:09.232 --> 26:12.449
I've just been informed that Evan's cell
division is increasing exponentially,

26:12.473 --> 26:15.291
along with the energy
he expels when he ages.

26:15.712 --> 26:18.248
We have only a few hours
to stabilize Evan.

26:18.436 --> 26:20.435
According to the projections,
Evan is building

26:20.445 --> 26:22.670
towards a massive
chronological event.

26:23.262 --> 26:25.000
You're saying Evan's about to die?

26:25.305 --> 26:27.076
It's a lot worse than that.

26:27.334 --> 26:29.615
The next time Evan ages,
he'll release enough

26:29.641 --> 26:32.020
energy to kill himself
and anyone else at hand.

26:42.822 --> 26:43.738
Good night.

26:50.432 --> 26:53.085
We're closed.
Come back tomorrow.

26:58.181 --> 26:59.837
Are you deaf?

27:00.319 --> 27:01.798
What are you staring at?

27:02.397 --> 27:03.654
My father.

27:04.534 --> 27:05.896
Don't call me that.

27:05.932 --> 27:07.294
I'm not your dad.

27:07.315 --> 27:08.524
Yes, you are.

27:09.804 --> 27:11.201
Why won't you admit it?

27:11.236 --> 27:12.892
You stay the hell away from me.

27:13.174 --> 27:15.264
Please, dad. Just help me.

27:15.566 --> 27:16.658
I'm your son.

27:16.682 --> 27:17.979
No, you're not!

27:18.185 --> 27:20.169
You're some kind of freak!

27:34.855 --> 27:35.540
Dad?

27:42.045 --> 27:42.820
Dad?

27:44.440 --> 27:45.168
Dad.

27:49.460 --> 27:50.340
Oh, my god

27:52.066 --> 27:53.123
what have I done?

28:00.395 --> 28:02.403
Okay, dad, call me if you find him.

28:03.002 --> 28:03.941
What happened?

28:03.988 --> 28:05.245
Evan's gone.

28:05.327 --> 28:06.793
He must've snuck out.

28:06.840 --> 28:09.945
My parents are looking for him, and Lana's
at the farm in case he comes back.

28:09.980 --> 28:12.528
Well, let's make sure we can
help him when he turns up.

28:13.228 --> 28:13.838
Lex.

28:20.975 --> 28:21.821
He's dead.

28:26.635 --> 28:27.516
Evan.

28:28.337 --> 28:31.895
Clark, we needed a living donor
to stop Evan from aging again.

28:33.891 --> 28:36.017
There's gotta be something else
we can do to help him.

28:38.621 --> 28:39.701
There is.

28:41.321 --> 28:45.079
We need to track him down and seal him
in a containment chamber under Luthorcorp.

28:46.536 --> 28:47.675
No. Lex...

28:47.710 --> 28:50.869
it's the only way to contain
the blast from his final change.

28:53.041 --> 28:54.896
Lex, I'm not gonna let him just die.

28:54.919 --> 28:57.718
Nothing can stop that
from happening now, Clark.

28:59.209 --> 29:00.266
Look, I'm sorry,

29:00.301 --> 29:03.577
but if we don't isolate Evan, a lot of
innocent people are going to be killed.

29:19.716 --> 29:21.395
He hasn't come back, Mr. Kent.

29:22.663 --> 29:24.189
Let me know if you find him.

29:30.626 --> 29:33.232
Ok. Evan, I have been worried
sick about you.

29:33.267 --> 29:35.322
We've been looking for you all night.

29:39.573 --> 29:40.750
Are you okay?

29:41.701 --> 29:42.840
I don't know.

29:44.108 --> 29:45.775
I did something bad.

29:48.182 --> 29:49.744
Evan, tell me what happened.

29:53.254 --> 29:54.580
It was an accident...

29:57.046 --> 29:58.232
a mistake.

29:59.712 --> 30:01.823
We all make mistakes.

30:02.211 --> 30:04.289
It's part of what makes us human.

30:06.473 --> 30:07.530
What happened?

30:12.212 --> 30:13.421
Are you all right?

30:15.312 --> 30:16.767
It's happening again.

30:17.636 --> 30:18.705
I can feel it.

30:19.398 --> 30:22.692
I'm gonna call Clark, and we're
gonna get you help, okay?

30:30.559 --> 30:31.522
It's coming.

30:32.027 --> 30:33.365
I can feel it.

30:33.811 --> 30:36.395
There has to be something
that we can do.

30:39.283 --> 30:40.164
There is.

30:42.001 --> 30:44.305
The windmill that you told me about,

30:44.328 --> 30:45.373
remember?

30:46.512 --> 30:48.919
Where the whole world
stretches out around you.

30:52.947 --> 30:54.180
I'd like to see it.

30:54.591 --> 30:55.875
Just once.

30:59.491 --> 31:01.135
Please, Lana, hurry.

31:07.928 --> 31:08.715
Chloe,

31:08.750 --> 31:10.148
has Evan been here?

31:10.582 --> 31:14.105
No. I mean, at the rate he's aging,
I'm not even sure I'd recognize him.

31:14.140 --> 31:17.169
He must be with Lana. I keep trying
to call her, but all I get is static.

31:17.331 --> 31:20.901
Maybe he's putting off
an energy field like his mom was.

31:21.136 --> 31:22.733
That would explain the power surges.

31:22.768 --> 31:23.672
Power surges?

31:23.696 --> 31:26.467
Yeah, they've been popping up
all over town for the last hour.

31:26.503 --> 31:28.510
Looks, they're happening all over.

31:30.753 --> 31:31.728
What's this?

31:31.775 --> 31:34.884
It's the DWP grid. See,
these are the affected areas.

31:34.919 --> 31:36.387
Where's the most recent one?

31:36.422 --> 31:37.373
Um...

31:39.370 --> 31:40.908
10 miles west

31:40.943 --> 31:43.245
on the outskirts of town
in the middle of nowhere.

31:43.268 --> 31:45.135
Why would Lana and Evan
be way out there?

31:45.171 --> 31:46.122
The windmill.

31:46.591 --> 31:48.176
The one at chandler field?

31:54.451 --> 31:55.883
Go get 'em, speedy.

31:59.946 --> 32:00.909
You were right.

32:01.425 --> 32:03.489
The whole world is right there.

32:09.559 --> 32:10.757
It's beautiful.

32:12.800 --> 32:15.125
I'm glad you finally got
a chance to see it.

32:29.513 --> 32:31.110
Lana, you have to go.

32:32.002 --> 32:33.517
No, Clark, we have to help him.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.278
There's no time.
You have to go now.

32:35.405 --> 32:36.298
Clark...

32:37.096 --> 32:38.094
go.

32:47.540 --> 32:48.902
It's okay. I'm here.

32:49.501 --> 32:50.887
I'm sorry for what I said.

32:51.016 --> 32:53.011
It's okay, I know.
It's all right.

32:53.093 --> 32:55.383
I'm glad it was you
and Lana that found me.

32:56.510 --> 32:58.471
I think you found us.

32:59.023 --> 33:00.243
What's happening?

33:00.302 --> 33:02.181
I can feel it.
You better go.

33:02.228 --> 33:03.014
No.

33:03.108 --> 33:04.729
Evan, I'm not leaving you.

33:06.831 --> 33:08.838
I wish you had been
my father, Clark.

33:14.035 --> 33:14.881
Evan.

33:15.679 --> 33:16.560
Evan.

33:36.680 --> 33:37.514
Clark!

33:38.136 --> 33:38.970
Clark!

33:47.784 --> 33:48.547
Clark,

33:48.770 --> 33:49.745
are you all right?

33:50.365 --> 33:52.372
I got clear just before...

33:53.089 --> 33:54.145
where's Evan?

33:58.706 --> 33:59.680
He's gone.

34:35.589 --> 34:37.397
I can't believe he's gone.

34:39.603 --> 34:40.743
I know. Me too.

34:43.547 --> 34:45.590
This whole year, I've felt...

34:45.871 --> 34:47.750
so disconnected.

34:49.559 --> 34:51.866
But when Evan came into my life,

34:53.580 --> 34:56.797
it was like I finally knew
where I belonged.

34:58.438 --> 35:00.071
I had a purpose.

35:00.106 --> 35:01.984
He only lived for a short time,

35:03.628 --> 35:07.042
but it seems like Evan's affected us
like we've known him our whole lives.

35:11.105 --> 35:14.690
Clark, we think we have
all the time in the world,

35:14.713 --> 35:17.731
that we're going to live forever,
but it's not true.

35:19.892 --> 35:22.250
I guess we should make
the most of the time we have

35:24.093 --> 35:25.608
before it's too late.

35:36.781 --> 35:39.059
This was his favorite book.

35:40.668 --> 35:41.443
Really?

35:41.619 --> 35:42.617
Yeah.

35:44.308 --> 35:46.456
It was my favorite book
when I was a kid.

35:50.496 --> 35:51.283
I, um,

35:52.410 --> 35:54.782
I used to pretend
that I was the rabbit.

35:55.757 --> 35:59.268
I was just like him, and my parents had
brought me to life with their love.

36:03.409 --> 36:07.154
My only hope is that
Evan felt that way about us.

36:27.708 --> 36:30.268
It's a 1961 Bordeaux.

36:32.356 --> 36:33.694
I am honored.

36:34.645 --> 36:37.792
Well, I assume your visit
means I have...

36:38.191 --> 36:39.624
cause to celebrate.

36:39.953 --> 36:42.898
Don't all my visits deserve
to be celebrated, Genevieve?

36:44.577 --> 36:46.902
Some more than others.

36:48.597 --> 36:49.458
Mmm...

36:50.965 --> 36:52.503
do you have something for me?

36:53.642 --> 36:55.474
I most certainly do.

36:57.552 --> 36:59.689
To the resolution of our problem.

37:00.088 --> 37:00.828
Hmm...

37:07.518 --> 37:08.704
parenthood...

37:08.892 --> 37:11.252
it's an interesting
phenomenon, isn't it?

37:14.140 --> 37:17.887
The lengths we go to...
to protect our children.

37:23.840 --> 37:25.014
No limits.

37:26.462 --> 37:28.200
What are you...

37:36.431 --> 37:39.742
The wine you've just drunk
will kill you in a matter of minutes.

37:41.973 --> 37:44.580
I'm told that the pain
will be excruciating.

37:47.529 --> 37:48.962
How about a trade?

37:49.741 --> 37:53.557
You give me the stone that you
stole from Bridgette Crosby,

37:54.121 --> 37:55.671
and I give you...

37:57.641 --> 37:58.992
the antidote.

38:00.119 --> 38:01.575
One more thing...

38:03.242 --> 38:05.215
you go near my son,

38:05.426 --> 38:09.065
and anything that happens
to him happens to you.

38:11.190 --> 38:12.576
Is that understood?

38:16.881 --> 38:18.737
The element, Genevieve.

38:19.899 --> 38:21.003
Where is it?

38:47.540 --> 38:49.733
You did everything you could, Clark.

38:52.868 --> 38:54.759
I'm sure Evan knew that.

38:59.967 --> 39:02.925
All the times that
I've run off or disappeared

39:04.158 --> 39:06.824
or almost died, how do you
guys deal with that?

39:09.058 --> 39:12.604
It isn't easy, Clark, but
it does come with the territory.

39:14.859 --> 39:17.783
You see, every parent's greatest fear
is that one day they...

39:17.820 --> 39:19.839
will lose their child forever.

39:23.514 --> 39:26.368
It seems like raising a kid
is the toughest job in the world.

39:26.732 --> 39:29.160
It's also the most rewarding.

39:30.017 --> 39:32.328
There is nothing quite like

39:33.291 --> 39:34.899
watching your son

39:36.156 --> 39:39.114
grow up into a young man
you can be very proud of.

39:44.917 --> 39:46.972
It's too bad I'll never know
what that's like.

39:48.593 --> 39:49.520
Why not?

39:52.294 --> 39:53.973
I'm from another planet.

39:55.781 --> 39:58.646
I'm not even human.
Who knows if I can have kids?

39:59.010 --> 40:02.237
Clark, your father and
I couldn't have children.

40:03.646 --> 40:05.771
We were still blessed with a son.

40:08.614 --> 40:11.455
You never know what
the future will bring you.

40:30.858 --> 40:31.844
Clark.

40:32.173 --> 40:35.460
Lana told me you straightened
things out with child services.

40:36.141 --> 40:37.386
I appreciate it.

40:37.961 --> 40:40.231
Well, I know you grew
pretty tight with him.

40:41.440 --> 40:44.481
I promise you, Evan's life wasn't in vain.

40:44.892 --> 40:46.019
What do you mean?

40:46.794 --> 40:49.066
Well, my team believes
studying his unique

40:49.093 --> 40:51.470
cellular structure could
advance research on

40:51.514 --> 40:55.246
cancer and age-related
diseases by hundreds of years.

40:56.537 --> 41:00.741
I'm releasing our findings to every
research facility across the globe.

41:00.964 --> 41:04.298
Evan's life may offer hope
for generations to come.

41:07.656 --> 41:09.581
He was a special kid, Lex.

41:12.341 --> 41:15.058
I can't help wondering what
kind of man he would've become.

41:15.997 --> 41:17.124
A good one...

41:18.052 --> 41:19.931
as long as you were in his life.

41:20.764 --> 41:23.312
I bet you're gonna be
a great dad someday, Clark.

41:27.907 --> 41:29.386
So will you, Lex.

41:30.419 --> 41:31.993
I don't know about that.

41:33.507 --> 41:36.382
Look, we're all reflections
of how we've been raised.

41:36.429 --> 41:38.824
Your parents gave you
encouragement and support.

41:38.871 --> 41:40.703
My chose the opposite track.

41:41.595 --> 41:44.422
I plan on leaving
a different kind of legacy.

41:48.426 --> 41:50.023
Well, I better get back to work.

41:52.550 --> 41:53.618
Thanks, Lex.

42:05.939 --> 42:06.985
Mr. Luthor...

42:07.759 --> 42:09.885
are you sure you want
to release the findings?

42:11.834 --> 42:13.088
Eventually...
