00:00.767 --> 00:02.667
You have an 11-year-old little girl.

00:02.734 --> 00:04.333
Yes.

00:04.400 --> 00:07.533
You told your daughter,
"You're going to get braces."

00:07.600 --> 00:11.533
I'm a single mom and I could not afford
to do braces by myself.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.500
Is he supposed to pay?

00:13.567 --> 00:14.467
Yes.

00:15.633 --> 00:18.066
It's simple. I have other things
to do today.

Court come to order! All rise!

00:51.934 --> 00:53.266
[Judy]
Have a seat, please.

00:54.667 --> 00:57.433
Case 1010, McCants versus Frazier.

00:58.367 --> 01:01.433
Ms. McCants, I gather
that you fell in love with this guy

01:01.500 --> 01:03.934
-a long time ago, for a short time.
-I did.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.600
I gather from the papers
that you were in high school?

01:06.667 --> 01:09.767
-I was.
-[Judy] The relationship was short-lived,

01:09.834 --> 01:14.200
but the product of that was
now an 11-year-old little girl,

01:14.266 --> 01:16.200
who I assume both of you adore.

01:16.266 --> 01:17.300
Yes.

01:17.367 --> 01:19.767
[Judy] Is this your only child,
or do you have others?

01:19.834 --> 01:21.166
[crying] She's my only.

01:21.233 --> 01:23.800
-[Judy] And you, sir?
-I have two more.

01:23.867 --> 01:26.934
Are the two other children that you
have currently living with you?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.433
-Yes.
-[Judy] Okay.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.567
-And are you remarried?
-No.

01:30.633 --> 01:32.934
Just so that I know
a little bit more about you.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.266
Ms. McCants, you're employed?

01:35.333 --> 01:37.333
-Part time.
-[Judy] What kind of work do you do?

01:37.400 --> 01:40.400
I'm an assistant director
on music videos.

01:40.467 --> 01:41.600
[Judy]
And you, sir?

01:41.667 --> 01:43.567
I work at a factory, a bagel factory.

01:43.633 --> 01:46.033
The issue in the case has to do
with two things.

01:46.100 --> 01:48.367
-Your daughter's name is Vanessa?
-Yes.

01:48.433 --> 01:50.600
And it has to do with Vanessa's braces,

01:50.667 --> 01:53.767
and then an airline ticket,
which I can get to later.

01:53.834 --> 01:57.367
You both live in different jurisdictions,
and I gather, Mr. Frazier,

01:57.433 --> 01:59.667
that you and Ms. McCants,
despite the fact

01:59.734 --> 02:02.400
that you've probably had
some bumpy issues,

02:02.467 --> 02:05.367
you've maintained a close
relationship with your daughter.

02:05.433 --> 02:06.600
Oh, yes, definitely.

02:06.667 --> 02:09.734
-And you visit her, or she visits you?
-Yes--

02:09.800 --> 02:11.600
How many times a year
does she visit you?

02:11.667 --> 02:16.033
Uh, every other holiday, and I
get her for the summer for six weeks.

02:16.100 --> 02:19.734
Is that an agreement that you two
came to by yourselves,

02:19.800 --> 02:23.066
-or did it involve court intervention?
-Court.

02:23.133 --> 02:25.200
And how long has that order been in place?

02:25.266 --> 02:26.900
Since 2018.

02:26.967 --> 02:29.433
And there's been visitation
consistently since?

02:29.500 --> 02:30.734
-Yes.
-[Judy] Great.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.800
-[Kellin] Yes. Yes.
-Well, that's terrific.

02:32.867 --> 02:36.333
I applaud you, because
that's good for your daughter.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.300
-Yes.
-[Judy] Yeah.

02:38.367 --> 02:41.533
Tell me about the issue of the braces,
Ms. McCants.

02:42.166 --> 02:47.166
Last summer, in 2020, my daughter

02:47.233 --> 02:49.367
-went for her visit--
-[Judy] Do you need a minute?

02:49.433 --> 02:50.433
No, I'm sorry.

02:50.500 --> 02:51.567
Do you need a tissue?

02:51.633 --> 02:54.100
-[Shawntia] Yes, I'm sorry.
-Yes.

02:54.500 --> 02:55.633
Kevin.

02:56.934 --> 02:59.133
-Here you go. Mm-hmm.
-[Shawntia] Thank you.

02:59.200 --> 03:03.266
Okay. She went for her visit,
and she asked her dad

03:03.333 --> 03:07.367
what was wrong with her teeth,
because when she was a little girl,

03:07.433 --> 03:12.300
she fell off her bike and messed up
her teeth, or so she thought,

03:12.367 --> 03:15.300
and she had asked him
what was wrong with her,

03:15.367 --> 03:18.033
you know, why her teeth
looked like that, basically.

03:18.100 --> 03:20.266
And he said, "You have ugly teeth
like your mom--"

03:20.333 --> 03:22.300
-Not true, not true.
-[Judy] Just a second. Just a second.

03:22.367 --> 03:26.500
A, I honestly don't believe that he said
to a child that he loves,

03:26.567 --> 03:28.166
"You have ugly teeth like your mom."

03:28.233 --> 03:31.066
She's not here to tell me
that that's what he said,

03:31.133 --> 03:34.467
so I'm just telling you,
I'm not quite sure.

03:34.533 --> 03:37.667
She texted me what he said
when he said it.

03:37.734 --> 03:39.166
-[Judy] Do you have it?
-I do.

03:39.233 --> 03:40.333
[Judy]
I'd like to take a look at it.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.367
"Ugly teeth like your mom."
I never said that.

03:42.433 --> 03:44.600
[Judy laughing]
If you're talking to yourself--

03:44.667 --> 03:48.500
-I'm sorry. I would never say that.
-Mr. Frazier, not helpful.

03:48.567 --> 03:49.867
Ma'am.

03:49.934 --> 03:53.266
-Before Vanessa went to see her dad...
-[Shawntia sniffles]

03:53.333 --> 03:55.433
had you discussed her teeth with her?

03:55.500 --> 03:56.834
-No.
-[Judy] Ever?

03:56.900 --> 03:58.600
No. [sniffles]

03:59.467 --> 04:00.667
[sighs]

04:01.700 --> 04:05.700
There's nothing in here that that says
that he told her she had ugly teeth.

04:05.767 --> 04:08.767
Um... I thought it was in that one.

04:08.834 --> 04:13.066
According to this, she had a conversation
with her father about her teeth

04:13.133 --> 04:17.033
and how they might've gotten that way.
Did he drop her,

04:17.100 --> 04:18.834
-did she fall off her bike?
-Right.

04:18.900 --> 04:23.734
Mom told me this, told me that,
and he said you probably need braces.

04:23.800 --> 04:28.967
And she wrote to you and said
don't tell Dad.

04:29.033 --> 04:32.100
You wrote back that
"you have a beautiful smile

04:32.166 --> 04:35.367
and we're going to get you braces
so that you can look even better.

04:35.433 --> 04:40.000
He's just mad no one took care of him
the way I take care of you.

04:40.066 --> 04:44.967
He's a sad man--"
It's typical separated parents and--

04:45.033 --> 04:48.467
But there's nowhere where he said ug--
I couldn't imagine,

04:48.533 --> 04:50.266
-somebody who has...
-Not at all.

04:50.333 --> 04:53.934
[Judy] ...a regular, consistent
relationship with a child,

04:54.000 --> 04:56.800
told this child that in any way
she was ugly,

04:57.333 --> 05:02.200
using that word. In any event,
based upon what you gave me, here,

05:02.266 --> 05:07.200
you told your daughter, in this text,
"Don't worry, you're going to get braces."

05:07.266 --> 05:10.967
That's what you say to her.
Okay, and that's what this case is about,

05:11.033 --> 05:12.967
who's supposed to pay for the braces.

05:13.033 --> 05:15.967
Okay, let me hear what happened.
Then she came home.

05:16.033 --> 05:18.300
She came home and, like I said, she--

05:18.367 --> 05:23.233
I don't want you to tell me anymore
what your daughter said

05:23.300 --> 05:26.767
that you can't confirm to me
in some sort of a written document,

05:26.834 --> 05:30.934
because that's hearsay. I'm assuming,
for the purposes of this case,

05:31.000 --> 05:36.333
that the first time braces were mentioned,
according to you,

05:36.400 --> 05:39.233
was during this visit with her father?

05:39.300 --> 05:43.333
-Yes.
-And the subject of her teeth came up,

05:43.400 --> 05:45.834
and he said, "No,
you have your mom's teeth,

05:45.900 --> 05:50.133
both y'all need braces."
Does that sound right, sir?

05:50.200 --> 05:53.467
Uh, I don't-- I think I said it like that,
I'm not sure.

05:53.533 --> 05:56.400
Okay. So, both of you need braces,
you have your mom's teeth.

05:56.467 --> 06:01.000
Okay, and she's 11 and she's getting to
that age where she's being self-conscious

06:01.066 --> 06:05.033
about, probably, a whole bunch of things.
All of that, not unusual.

06:05.100 --> 06:08.734
So now, before I get to
the strict issue of braces,

06:08.800 --> 06:13.834
I assume that if you're in court, and
if you're in court as recently as 2018,

06:14.333 --> 06:17.467
and you have visitation with your daughter
every other holiday

06:17.533 --> 06:20.900
and during the summers,
there is also a support order in place.

06:20.967 --> 06:22.667
-Yes.
-And can you tell me

06:22.734 --> 06:24.800
what that support order is, Mr. Frazier?

06:24.867 --> 06:27.800
Yes. I pay, uh, $500 every month.

06:27.867 --> 06:30.800
-You pay $500 every month.
-[Kellin] Yeah, for child support.

06:30.867 --> 06:33.667
Are you consistent now
in your child support payments?

06:33.734 --> 06:34.834
Are you up to date?

06:34.900 --> 06:38.266
I haven't missed a date in, like,
ten years, I've been paying.

06:38.333 --> 06:41.667
-That's not true.
-Are there current arrears in that order?

06:41.734 --> 06:43.667
-Yes.
-[Judy] And what are the arrears?

06:43.734 --> 06:44.900
Thirteen hundred.

06:44.967 --> 06:48.800
Okay. Well, over a long period of time,
$1,300, he's--

06:48.867 --> 06:51.900
So, he's relatively current
in his child support order.

06:51.967 --> 06:54.867
Is there anything else that's provided
in the judge's order

06:54.934 --> 07:00.467
with regard to medical, dental,
or any unusual expenses,

07:00.533 --> 07:02.900
other than the $500 a month?

07:02.967 --> 07:05.967
It says, "All uninsured health expenses

07:06.033 --> 07:08.233
exceeding the annual
ordinary medical amount

07:08.300 --> 07:11.500
will be paid 40 percent by the Plaintiff
and 60 percent by the Defendant."

07:11.567 --> 07:13.500
May I see it, please? Kevin?

07:18.700 --> 07:22.166
It says, "All uninsured
healthcare expenses

07:22.233 --> 07:25.100
exceeding the annual
ordinary medical amount,"

07:25.166 --> 07:28.066
which the court fixes at $403,

07:28.133 --> 07:32.033
"will be paid for 40 percent by the
Plaintiff," she was the Plaintiff.

07:32.100 --> 07:35.066
-[Kellin] Right.
-"...and 60% by the Defendant."

07:35.133 --> 07:37.967
Yes, uh, but I didn't think it was
a necessary medical--

07:38.033 --> 07:40.200
-We'll get to that in a minute.
-[Kellin] Okay.

07:40.266 --> 07:43.700
Whether it was necessary or not,
we're gonna get to in a second,

07:43.767 --> 07:46.033
based on upon some things
that I'm looking at.

07:46.100 --> 07:49.500
But now, I want you to tell me,
Ms. McCants,

07:49.567 --> 07:53.233
what conversation did you have with
her father, with regard to the braces?

07:53.300 --> 07:57.233
I don't talk to her dad, he doesn't
respond to my text messages, usually,

07:57.300 --> 08:01.233
so I talk to my daughter
and she will text her dad.

08:01.300 --> 08:04.233
So, she's like our go-between
for conversations--

08:04.300 --> 08:05.433
Oh, that's unfortunate.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.767
-It is, it's really sad.
-That's not true.

08:07.834 --> 08:09.066
-Shh!
-[Kellin] I'm sorry.

08:09.133 --> 08:10.133
[theme music playing]

08:10.200 --> 08:12.033
[Judy]
That's not his signature.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.800
He signed for the braces--

08:13.867 --> 08:15.867
[Judy]
That's not his signature.

08:15.934 --> 08:21.367
You don't have to be a handwriting expert
to look at the signature on his answer...

08:21.433 --> 08:24.900
-No, I understand, he--
-[Judy] ...and this is not his signature.

08:27.934 --> 08:29.233
[theme music playing]

08:34.066 --> 08:37.100
[narrator]
<i>Shawntia McCants says ex-boyfriend</i>

08:37.166 --> 08:41.533
<i>Kellin Frazier owes for their</i>
<i>daughter's braces and an airline ticket.</i>

08:41.600 --> 08:45.967
So, what you're telling me is that
you never had a direct conversation

08:46.033 --> 08:49.200
with Mr. Frazier about
his participation in the braces.

08:49.266 --> 08:52.333
That's correct. I do have
the text messages from my daughter

08:52.400 --> 08:54.300
-of what he said--
-[Judy] No,

08:54.367 --> 08:58.800
I don't want to see text messages
from your daughter, what he said.

08:58.867 --> 09:04.066
If you have a text message from him
agreeing to pay for more than

09:04.133 --> 09:08.000
what is allocated in
the child support order, I will see that.

09:08.066 --> 09:11.767
But I don't want to see
your daughter's interpretation--

09:11.834 --> 09:13.834
No, I absolutely understand, Your Honor.

09:13.900 --> 09:15.934
-Okay, great.
-So, okay, I have text messages

09:16.000 --> 09:17.767
between him and I as well, but--

09:17.834 --> 09:22.233
I just want to see--
Your position is that he said to you,

09:22.300 --> 09:25.734
this is what you say in your complaint,
if you pay the down payment,

09:25.800 --> 09:28.667
-he'll make the rest of the payments.
-That's exactly what he said.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.967
That's what I want to see. Not that your
daughter said he said, but what he said.

09:32.033 --> 09:35.266
-No, that's direct text messages.
-[Judy] From him to--

09:35.333 --> 09:37.233
Yes, to his daughter.

09:42.133 --> 09:44.066
-He even signed--
-[Judy] Shh-shh!

09:44.133 --> 09:48.000
No. This is a child having
a conversation with her father.

09:48.066 --> 09:52.233
And this is a discussion about
the down payment of $500.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.500
-That-- That's part of it--
-And she says--

09:53.567 --> 09:54.967
Just a sec, that's part of it.

09:55.033 --> 09:58.000
And she's saying, "I just want my braces

09:58.066 --> 10:00.834
and I don't like being
in the middle of this."

10:00.900 --> 10:05.500
That's the 11-year-old saying.
And then, Mr. Frazier says to her,

10:05.567 --> 10:09.633
"Tell her to pay the $500 and
I will cover the monthly payments."

10:09.700 --> 10:12.934
That's what he says.
"Okay, she says she will do that,

10:13.000 --> 10:15.900
but you need to call and
give the credit card information

10:15.967 --> 10:18.967
so they can get started
at 2:30 p.m. today.

10:19.033 --> 10:22.533
They can't get started without
your information first."

10:22.600 --> 10:27.000
And you said to her, "Give me the number
who I have to talk to."

10:27.066 --> 10:30.700
And her dad's saying, "That's why
I don't like doing business with her,

10:30.767 --> 10:34.500
she just said that she would make
the down payment. I'm not paying half.

10:34.567 --> 10:38.233
I have to pay over $4,000 to her $500."

10:38.300 --> 10:40.567
-So, there's more--
-Yes, Your Honor.

10:40.633 --> 10:43.100
-Please let me explain. Okay.
-[Judy] Yeah.

10:43.166 --> 10:46.433
So, what happened was,
my daughter said that--

10:46.500 --> 10:48.066
No, you can't tell me what your daughter--

10:48.133 --> 10:50.433
The problem is, you can't tell me what
your daughter said.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.767
When I was talking to her, we were
talking about the braces.

10:52.834 --> 10:54.233
-[Judy] Who was?
-My daughter and I.

10:54.300 --> 10:57.100
I don't care whether your daughter and
you were talking about the braces.

10:57.166 --> 11:00.266
You can't tell me what your daughter said.
It's hearsay.

11:00.333 --> 11:02.800
I was telling my daughter

11:02.867 --> 11:06.300
-what to say on the phone.
-I don't-- I don't care.

11:06.367 --> 11:08.767
It's hearsay.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.033
It's hearsay. Let me tell you
about an oral contract,

11:11.100 --> 11:13.000
because you don't have a written contract.

11:13.066 --> 11:17.900
An oral contract has to have
all of the elements

11:17.967 --> 11:20.033
that a written contract does.

11:20.100 --> 11:25.000
And you don't make that through
an intermediary who's 11 years old.

11:25.066 --> 11:29.667
You just don't do that.
It's clear from this that it was unclear.

11:29.734 --> 11:35.467
According to this, which is your order,
because what you are attempting to do,

11:35.533 --> 11:40.800
Ms. McCants, is modify the judicial order,
which requires him to pay 60 percent.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.467
-No, ma'am. No, ma'am. Please.
-[Judy] Yeah.

11:42.533 --> 11:44.000
Please, may I explain, please?

11:44.066 --> 11:46.100
[Judy] You can, if you
can do it without hearsay.

11:46.166 --> 11:49.600
Okay. Okay. This was not
a court-ordered agreement.

11:49.667 --> 11:54.800
This was something that
I told Vanessa

11:54.867 --> 11:59.800
that I was not able to pay for braces,
I could not afford it by myself.

11:59.867 --> 12:03.867
I'm a single mom and
I take care of her by myself.

12:03.934 --> 12:05.967
-That's not true.
-I do get child support,

12:06.033 --> 12:09.000
and it does help,
but it does not cover all of our bills.

12:09.066 --> 12:13.033
So I explained to Vanessa,
I could not afford to do braces by myself.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.700
Was that before or after
she went to visit her father?

12:15.767 --> 12:16.800
That was after.

12:16.867 --> 12:21.967
Okay, and you left it up to an 11-year-old
to communicate with her father.

12:22.033 --> 12:25.166
What I'm telling you, Ms. McCants,
is I understand your position.

12:25.233 --> 12:27.934
and believe me,
I'm sympathetic with your position,

12:28.000 --> 12:29.600
-but this is a court.
-Yes, ma'am.

12:29.667 --> 12:33.333
And right now, what you have is
a judicial order that's signed.

12:33.400 --> 12:36.867
And it says that the Defendant,

12:36.934 --> 12:38.800
and I don't know whether
he's paid 60 percent--

12:38.867 --> 12:40.367
-He has not.
-[Judy] Okay.

12:40.433 --> 12:42.300
-I have proof I have, for Your Honor.
-Just a second.

12:42.367 --> 12:44.600
That's stage number three of this case.

12:44.667 --> 12:47.834
That's the judicial order.
And I'm telling you now

12:47.900 --> 12:51.500
that using an 11-year-old
to act as a go-between,

12:51.567 --> 12:53.900
unless you have had
direct conversations with her,

12:53.967 --> 12:58.233
to modify a court order and relying on
hearsay is something we can't do in court.

12:58.300 --> 13:00.867
-We just can't.
-No, I do understand, Your Honor.

13:00.934 --> 13:04.033
What I'm-- What I would really,
am trying to say is,

13:04.100 --> 13:07.433
when she got home,
I told her I could not--

13:07.500 --> 13:09.633
-[Judy] That's hearsay.
-That's hearsay, okay.

13:09.700 --> 13:13.166
Yes. Any out-of-court statement
that you make to your daughter--

13:13.233 --> 13:16.767
-You're trying to develop a contract-
-No, the text messages

13:16.834 --> 13:19.734
are my contract because
that's her texting her dad.

13:19.800 --> 13:25.400
He said, "I will not pay the down payment.
I will pay the $4,000 for your braces."

13:25.467 --> 13:30.734
Her braces came up to $5,079.
If I paid $500, that leaves $4,500.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.934
What the last thing that he said was--
You have to have a meeting of the minds

13:34.000 --> 13:35.600
to have a modification of a contract.

13:35.667 --> 13:39.133
And any modification of a written contract
really has to be in writing.

13:39.200 --> 13:43.433
Even if I were to stretch that and say
he agreed to pay for her braces,

13:43.500 --> 13:46.166
the last thing he says here,
"I'm not paying half."

13:46.233 --> 13:48.133
-Half of the down payment--
-[Judy] Shh!

13:48.200 --> 13:51.633
The last thing that he said is
"I'm not paying half.

13:51.700 --> 13:54.467
I have to pay over $4,000 to her $500."

13:54.533 --> 13:57.934
Right, he wasn't paying half of the down
payment. That's what he was saying.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.767
-Well, I don't know th--
-Your Honor, please,

14:00.834 --> 14:01.934
please, please listen.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.834
If he's saying he has to pay
over $4,000 for her braces,

14:04.900 --> 14:08.000
that would mean he's taking on
the responsibility of her braces.

14:08.066 --> 14:10.433
That's what you--
It's an interpretation that you're making.

14:10.500 --> 14:11.500
Your Honor, um--

14:11.567 --> 14:13.066
It's an interpretation that you're making.

14:13.133 --> 14:17.066
And I think that the mistake is,
it's really a mistake in communication,

14:17.133 --> 14:20.066
and I don't know how to rectify that,
because it's gonna become

14:20.133 --> 14:23.166
more complex, Mr. Frazier,
as your daughter gets older.

14:23.233 --> 14:25.867
-Yes.
-[Judy] You know, it's clear to me,

14:25.934 --> 14:31.834
from listening to the two of you,
especially listening to you, Ms. McCants,

14:31.900 --> 14:36.734
that this is something that your daughter,
at age 11, wanted.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.066
-Yes.
-She wanted,

14:39.133 --> 14:43.500
irrespective of what her father was--
Said, or didn't say to her.

14:43.567 --> 14:45.033
-The ins--
-Your Honor,

14:45.100 --> 14:46.967
I would not have paid
the down payment.

14:47.033 --> 14:48.734
-I would not--
-[Judy] Just a second.

14:48.800 --> 14:52.467
You're not paying attention.
This is something that an 11-year-old

14:52.533 --> 14:55.233
felt self-conscious about and she wanted.

14:55.300 --> 14:59.633
And she must be bright and
she must have known

14:59.700 --> 15:04.066
that the only way that it was
gonna get done is if her father did it.

15:04.133 --> 15:08.033
Because you made it clear to her
that you couldn't afford to pay for it.

15:08.100 --> 15:12.633
Because she is, in fact, in these
text messages, really pleading with him

15:12.700 --> 15:14.900
to take over the braces,
something she really wants.

15:14.967 --> 15:19.400
I feel sorry for her. I feel sorry for her
father that he's put in this situation.

15:19.467 --> 15:23.300
I feel especially sorry for you,
because as the child's mother,

15:23.367 --> 15:27.600
there's no question in my mind that you
want her to grow up feeling confident.

15:27.667 --> 15:31.133
And if this is taking away from her
confidence, that's not a good thing.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.967
-Yes, Your Honor.
-[Judy] So, I got it.

15:33.033 --> 15:37.900
I also would like to say, we
have been going to the orthodontist.

15:37.967 --> 15:42.100
And so, even though you're saying
it's not a written agreement...

15:42.800 --> 15:46.433
The agreement was, it was
I pay the down payment of $500

15:46.500 --> 15:47.900
and he pay the monthly payment.

15:47.967 --> 15:50.633
-I said no.
-Okay. Okay. The only thing--

15:50.700 --> 15:53.567
The only thing that I'm going to ask
Mr. Frazier is,

15:53.633 --> 15:55.900
that's what you understood
the agreement to be,

15:55.967 --> 15:58.834
-is that the agreement that you made?
-No.

15:58.900 --> 16:00.867
Mr. Frazier...

16:00.934 --> 16:02.166
I'm sorry.

16:03.667 --> 16:06.667
When you cancelled the ticket,
did you get the money back?

16:06.734 --> 16:09.200
I didn't get the money back
until a week later 'cause she--

16:09.266 --> 16:13.800
I don't care if it's a week later,
I don't care if it's next Tisha B'Av,

16:13.867 --> 16:16.400
it doesn't matter to me,
you got the money back.

16:20.200 --> 16:21.633
[theme music playing]

16:26.200 --> 16:29.700
[narrator] <i>Shawntia McCants</i>
<i>accuses her daughter's father</i>

16:29.767 --> 16:35.100
<i>Kellin Frazier of refusing to pay for</i>
<i>the cost of braces and travel expenses.</i>

16:35.166 --> 16:40.000
Tell me what the agreement, in your mind,

16:40.066 --> 16:44.367
was with regard to your daughter's braces.
You clearly had a discussion with her

16:44.433 --> 16:48.800
when she was visiting with you in 2020
during the summer about the braces.

16:48.867 --> 16:52.066
Yes, but I spoke with Shawntia.

16:52.133 --> 16:54.967
I only promised to pay when
I could afford it, which I have.

16:55.033 --> 16:56.300
You spoke to her directly?

16:56.367 --> 16:57.367
[Kellin] I spoke to her
directly on the phone.

16:57.433 --> 17:00.800
Okay. Now, Mr. Frazier,
you have to know that

17:00.867 --> 17:06.500
I have trouble believing that
"I will pay when I can afford to pay it,"

17:06.567 --> 17:10.233
because you're a working guy,
you have three children,

17:10.300 --> 17:12.633
you have $500 taken out of your pay.

17:12.700 --> 17:15.667
And the two children that you have
live with you. How old are they?

17:15.734 --> 17:17.700
Ten, eleven and three.

17:18.367 --> 17:20.200
-[Judy] Well, that's three children.
-Yeah, three childlren.

17:20.266 --> 17:22.300
No, my 11-year-old
does not live with him.

17:22.367 --> 17:24.867
-Are you counting Vanessa?
-I'm counting Vanessa, yeah.

17:24.934 --> 17:27.767
-Okay, so they are ten and three.
-Yes.

17:27.834 --> 17:30.667
How much was the entire dental work,
Ms. McCants?

17:30.734 --> 17:34.100
Five thousand, seventy-nine dollars
and seventy-six cents.

17:34.166 --> 17:36.500
-Is she finished with her dental work?
-No.

17:36.567 --> 17:39.166
Okay, but that's the entire cost
of the braces?

17:39.233 --> 17:40.767
-Yes.
-[Judy] Okay.

17:40.834 --> 17:45.633
And of that, so far, Mr. Frazier has paid,
according to your records,

17:45.700 --> 17:47.900
-how much?
-Six hundred and six dollars.

17:47.967 --> 17:51.734
Sarah, I need 60 percent

17:51.800 --> 17:54.467
of $5,079.

17:54.533 --> 17:55.834
[Shawntia] Your Honor...

17:55.900 --> 17:58.734
-I understand the court--
-[Judy] Ju-Just-- Don't--

17:58.800 --> 18:02.000
-I get 3,047.4, is that what you get?
-[Sarah] Yeah.

18:02.066 --> 18:03.066
-[Judy] Hmm?
-Yes.

18:03.133 --> 18:05.300
-[Shawntia] Your Honor.
-[Judy whispers] Oh, perfect!

18:05.367 --> 18:07.734
He signed the contract for the braces.

18:07.800 --> 18:10.133
-[Judy] Oh, I'd like to see that.
-[Kellin sighs]

18:10.200 --> 18:12.133
[papers rustling]

18:13.667 --> 18:16.900
You said $3,047, correct?

18:17.433 --> 18:18.967
-Yeah.
-[Sarah] Yeah. Great.

18:19.033 --> 18:22.000
I just put the decimal in the wrong place.
[chuckling] Thank you.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.500
That's not his signature.

18:30.734 --> 18:31.967
That's not his signature.

18:33.100 --> 18:34.600
He signed for the braces.

18:34.667 --> 18:36.066
That's not his signature.

18:36.133 --> 18:41.433
You don't have to be a handwriting expert
to look at the signature on his answer,

18:41.500 --> 18:43.066
No, I understand. He--

18:43.133 --> 18:45.500
and this is not his signature.

18:45.567 --> 18:50.066
No, I understand.
So, when I made the down payment,

18:50.133 --> 18:53.734
they gave me this contract,
and that was the part of the contract

18:53.800 --> 18:56.800
for the monthly payments.
You can see where it says

18:56.867 --> 18:59.767
his debit card number
for the monthly payment.

18:59.834 --> 19:02.166
That was on file.
That's just-- my debit card was on file.

19:02.233 --> 19:04.367
Just a second.
That's not what I asked you.

19:04.433 --> 19:06.233
I said this is not his signature.

19:06.300 --> 19:08.600
-Who wrote this signature?
-I signed it for him

19:08.667 --> 19:10.433
-when I was at the orthodontist. No.
-[woman laughs]

19:10.500 --> 19:12.834
-I had his permission to sign it.
-No, Your Honor, that's not true.

19:12.900 --> 19:13.934
[Judy] Shh!

19:15.266 --> 19:17.367
-I promise it is true.
-[Judy] Okay.

19:17.433 --> 19:21.400
Sarah, let me just check my math, $3,047

19:21.467 --> 19:23.200
-less what he paid--
-And four cents.

19:23.266 --> 19:25.934
Less what he paid, which is $606.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.834
Twenty-four forty-one?

19:27.900 --> 19:28.934
Your Honor?

19:29.000 --> 19:32.834
[Sarah] Two thousand, four hundred
forty-one dollars and four cents.

19:32.900 --> 19:37.767
In order to modify a written court order,
which this is,

19:37.834 --> 19:41.367
which provides that he's responsible
for any medical expenses

19:41.433 --> 19:44.667
in excess of a certain amount,
which is a de minimus amount of money,

19:44.734 --> 19:48.000
he is to pay 60 percent
and you are to pay 40 percent.

19:48.066 --> 19:51.533
What I have to do is to determine
whether or not there was

19:51.600 --> 19:56.867
such a compelling contract
between the two of you, in writing,

19:56.934 --> 20:00.533
to modify this order,
which was signed by a judge,

20:00.600 --> 20:05.934
that changes the logistics of this,
and I actually find that there was not.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.066
So, Mr. Frazier, you are responsible for

20:10.133 --> 20:13.934
an additional $2,441 to the orthodontist.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.867
Now, let's get to this airline ticket.

20:15.934 --> 20:21.667
The airline ticket is another part of your
lawsuit, and that involves the visit

20:21.734 --> 20:24.800
that either did take place,
or was supposed to take place

20:24.867 --> 20:29.700
in June of 2021. Was that for
the summer visit, Ms. McCants?

20:29.767 --> 20:32.967
-Yes.
-And Mr. Frazier, it's your obligation

20:33.033 --> 20:35.734
-to pay for the airline ticket?
-Yes, one way.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.900
-How much was the airline ticket?
-Two hundred and twenty-four dollars.

20:38.967 --> 20:41.266
You want to tell me what happened
this past summer,

20:41.333 --> 20:43.834
why you didn't pay that $241?

20:43.900 --> 20:47.133
I actually paid it, Your Honor,
but it was a scheduling conflict,

20:47.200 --> 20:51.633
so I had to cancel. So, Shawntia
went along and bought the tickets herself.

20:51.700 --> 20:53.934
I never agreed to reimburse her for that.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.834
But I did pay for the airline ticket.

20:55.900 --> 20:57.200
-She told me so that I'd reschedule--
-Well, wh--

20:57.266 --> 20:58.967
Did you get to
see your daughter in June?

20:59.033 --> 21:01.066
-Yes, she came down.
-I brought her up.

21:01.133 --> 21:04.266
-I paid for the--
-Just a second. Did she visit with you?

21:04.333 --> 21:06.567
-Yes.
-So, you enjoyed the visit,

21:06.633 --> 21:08.667
but ultimately didn't pay for the ticket?

21:08.734 --> 21:11.266
-Well, I did pay for the tickets.
-[Judy] But then you cancelled it.

21:11.333 --> 21:13.567
-Shawntia told me to cancel.
-Yes. No, I did not.

21:13.633 --> 21:15.600
Just a-- Whether you did or not--

21:15.667 --> 21:18.867
Listen, I'm gonna get to
the dessert of this case

21:18.934 --> 21:21.633
and you all want to start
with the appetizer.

21:21.700 --> 21:24.934
The dessert of this case has to do with

21:25.000 --> 21:28.734
a $224 airline ticket.

21:28.800 --> 21:30.700
-Yes.
-[Judy] Well, if it was unused,

21:30.767 --> 21:33.934
that's one thing, but you got to
enjoy your daughter's company

21:34.000 --> 21:36.867
-for that visit.
-Yes, yes.

21:36.934 --> 21:39.533
Yeah, well, and it was your agreement,

21:39.600 --> 21:44.266
-and it has been your agreement--
-I have proof that I paid for the tickets.

21:44.333 --> 21:47.200
He-- He-- He bought tickets
and cancelled them.

21:47.266 --> 21:49.467
'Cause she said it was
a scheduling conflict--

21:49.533 --> 21:51.734
Okay, just a--
There was a scheduling conflict.

21:51.800 --> 21:54.467
-[Kellin] Yeah, and--
-If you-- Mr. Frazier--

21:54.533 --> 21:55.533
I'm sorry.

21:57.333 --> 22:00.633
When you cancelled the ticket
did you get the money back?

22:00.700 --> 22:03.200
I didn't get the money back
until a week later, 'cause she--

22:03.266 --> 22:07.734
I don't care if it's a week later,
I don't care if it's next Tisha B'Av,

22:07.800 --> 22:10.633
it doesn't matter to me,
you got the money back.

22:10.700 --> 22:12.500
And she paid for the ticket,

22:12.567 --> 22:14.200
-and you had visitation.
-I did.

22:14.266 --> 22:17.934
It's simple, that's dessert.
That's not how we get there.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.567
I have other things to do today.

22:19.633 --> 22:22.300
The court order is saying she pay
one way, I pay the other way.

22:22.367 --> 22:23.900
Like, I'm paying to take her home--

22:23.967 --> 22:26.467
Just a second.
Did you pay the other way?

22:26.533 --> 22:29.700
I'm taking her home on Sunday.
I paid for that, completely.

22:29.767 --> 22:33.400
Is he supposed to pay for one way
for the child's visit,

22:33.467 --> 22:35.333
and you're supposed to pay for one way?

22:35.400 --> 22:36.367
Yes, Your Honor.

22:36.433 --> 22:40.400
And he is returning the child to you
at his own expense.

22:40.467 --> 22:43.567
-Yes.
-Well, then, you pay for the trip going.

22:43.633 --> 22:45.166
What difference does that make?

22:45.233 --> 22:48.700
The order is that he is supposed
to come get her from Georgia

22:48.767 --> 22:52.633
and I come get her from Michigan.
Because this has been an ongoing thing.

22:52.700 --> 22:54.767
-Not true.
-He will not come get his child.

22:54.834 --> 22:57.367
I have been forced to go take her to him

22:57.433 --> 23:01.233
because she wants to see her dad
and her brothers for the summer.

23:01.300 --> 23:03.000
I purchased the tickets--

23:03.066 --> 23:06.633
Are you talking about a ticket for you
or a ticket for her?

23:06.700 --> 23:08.533
For her and myself, like--

23:08.600 --> 23:10.800
[Judy] Is he supposed
to pay for your ticket?

23:10.867 --> 23:12.300
Yes. The court order says
he pays for three--

23:12.367 --> 23:14.066
-Let me see.
-You have the order.

23:14.133 --> 23:18.000
Would you have the Plaintiff
put an X where that is

23:18.066 --> 23:20.500
so that I don't have to
go through the whole thing?

23:21.000 --> 23:22.533
There. All right. Highlighter.

23:23.333 --> 23:24.967
Here you go, mark it.

23:27.900 --> 23:29.133
Okay. Thank you.

23:30.734 --> 23:31.500
Here, Judge.

23:34.900 --> 23:38.200
[Judy] Well, at age 11 is she considered
an unaccompanied minor?

23:38.266 --> 23:43.066
At this point, yes, but we've
never sent her by herself that way.

23:43.133 --> 23:48.300
Yeah, actually, if she's an unaccompanied
minor, it has to have either a fee,

23:48.367 --> 23:53.600
or a parent. Judgment for the Plaintiff
in the amount of $2,665,

23:53.667 --> 23:56.934
which includes the one-way ticket.
We're finished here, thank you very much.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.233

Court adjourned.

23:58.300 --> 23:59.467
[theme music playing]

24:01.066 --> 24:04.767
I thought it was fair, you know,
I'm obligated to pay 60 percent.

24:04.834 --> 24:08.033
He agreed to pay the whole payment
of the braces.

24:08.100 --> 24:10.133
I never called my daughter ugly,
I never will.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.734
He lied and got away with it.

24:11.800 --> 24:13.867
I really hope we can communicate better.

24:13.934 --> 24:16.767
That's fine, he can lie if he wants to.
He's very good at it.

24:17.900 --> 24:21.333
That seemed like a really tough call.
How do you make that decision

24:21.400 --> 24:24.000
when you can tell, obviously,
that both parents

24:24.066 --> 24:26.166
just want their daughter to feel her best?

24:26.233 --> 24:29.000
You know, clearly,
this child is fortunate.

24:29.066 --> 24:31.400
She has two parents
that really care about her.

24:31.467 --> 24:35.200
I think what it comes down to,
that even though it's a hard call,

24:35.266 --> 24:39.467
if you want to modify a court order
that has been litigated

24:39.533 --> 24:43.633
and resulted in an order of custody
and visitation,

24:43.700 --> 24:47.000
and support and medical bills,
then you don't use the child

24:47.066 --> 24:50.233
as a go-between, [chuckling]
the child is not an intermediary,

24:50.300 --> 24:52.900
to create a contract.
From a legal perspective,

24:52.967 --> 24:57.867
she didn't have the answer.
And I guess from a social perspective,

24:57.934 --> 25:03.000
parents have to love their children more

25:03.066 --> 25:06.166
[laughing] than they dislike each other.
That's the bottom line.
