We need to work together.

00:20.438 --> 00:21.928
Do you have that tech
you stole from us?

00:22.106 --> 00:24.518
If I don't recover
that, Zorin is never
gonna trust me!

00:24.609 --> 00:25.815
I need that key!

00:26.444 --> 00:27.980
CARLOS: Sure looks like
he's back on that playbook.

00:28.112 --> 00:29.773
You really want to
gamble that he's
not gonna flip again?

00:33.534 --> 00:36.947
You want a confession
from me because I'm
the villain.

00:38.164 --> 00:40.450
I'm a bad man.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.497
But then it's not
all I am, is it?

00:43.753 --> 00:46.540
I'm a special kind
of bad man.

00:46.631 --> 00:47.916
A freak.

00:48.925 --> 00:52.008
When people
find out about me,

00:52.094 --> 00:55.052
they find out about
all the other freaks,
as well.

00:57.058 --> 00:59.174
Nobody will believe him
if he says he comes
from the future.

00:59.268 --> 01:00.974
Yeah, but he has no past.

01:01.062 --> 01:03.223
It doesn't matter
if they don't believe him.

01:07.652 --> 01:09.142

All that's gonna get
you is a life sentence

GORD: All right,
Inspector, this is
a mess and you know it.

01:28.005 --> 01:31.293
The use of these restraints
is a human rights violation

01:31.384 --> 01:34.421
and my client has been held
for days without charges.

01:34.679 --> 01:36.795
Carlos can delay this.
We just need a few more days.

01:37.181 --> 01:38.170
No, he's stuck.

01:38.266 --> 01:40.427
He has to lay charges
soon or this is
an unlawful detention.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.042

03:29.126 --> 03:32.334

take him down.

03:32.421 --> 03:35.163

to act according to plan?

it means they're alive.

She wants to go home
even though home
probably isn't there.

07:46.675 --> 07:47.664
Does she understand that?

A chance?

That's an excellent question.

08:02.775 --> 08:04.686
Okay.

08:04.777 --> 08:10.818
So, the soldiers asked me
to provide Piron security
after your unscheduled visit.

08:10.908 --> 08:12.318
Those men are loyal to me,

08:12.409 --> 08:15.116
and they'll turn on
Zorin and his team
on my command.

08:16.038 --> 08:17.528
Okay. Sounds feasible.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.532
So, with my help,
you and Alec get
inside the building

08:21.669 --> 08:24.661
and, along with my security,
you neutralize the soldiers.

I think it's time
we invite him to the party.

with your technology,

09:48.172 --> 09:50.333
he has the ability
to send me home.

09:51.675 --> 09:53.757
And if he can do it for me,
he could do it for you, too.

to get it back.

10:07.524 --> 10:11.108
Even if I could,
what if I was too late?
I can't do that again.

10:11.195 --> 10:12.731
I can't...

10:12.821 --> 10:14.777
I can't lose them again.

10:14.865 --> 10:16.901

not much time,

10:16.992 --> 10:19.574
and ifyou don't want
to, I understand.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.070
But I really hope
you want to help.

10:23.874 --> 10:26.786
We need access
to the machine, just once.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.501
It doesn't have to be
dangerous for anybody.

10:30.005 --> 10:31.745
If I did choose to go back,

10:34.551 --> 10:37.133
I wouldn't compromise
this mission.

10:37.221 --> 10:38.256
I understand.

10:39.515 --> 10:41.847

back the key you requested,

10:41.934 --> 10:43.470
as a sign of my good faith.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.553
Alec really thinks
he can do this?

10:50.484 --> 10:54.568
He says "impossible"
to me as often as
he says "probable".

10:55.948 --> 10:56.937
But you're willing?

10:57.366 --> 10:58.947
For a chance to see my son?

10:59.034 --> 11:02.026
It's possible he may
not even be there.

11:04.039 --> 11:05.745
You're really killing
the moment.

11:07.459 --> 11:09.871

you might want to say
to help your case,

will say what it wants.

It doesn't matter to me.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.322
It'll take us both down.

to Kiera, either.

11:44.246 --> 11:45.406

and now she wants
to go back to sleep?

11:52.963 --> 11:55.329
You should take me
to court now, Inspector.

11:55.424 --> 11:56.755
I'll make sure she stays.

11:56.967 --> 11:58.923
Well... (CHUCKLES)

11:59.011 --> 12:00.842
Well, I don't blame
her for wanting
to go see her kid.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.636
Oh, she's still
walking out on you.

12:06.018 --> 12:07.929
It's not like that.

12:08.020 --> 12:09.681
(CHUCKLES)

12:09.771 --> 12:11.853
I'm not gonna hide
who I am, Fonnegra.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.564
Neither would you.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.529
The truth of me
reveals the truth
of her.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.154
(DOOR CLOSES)

12:30.083 --> 12:32.369
CARLOS: It's
a hell of a view, huh?

12:32.461 --> 12:33.701
I always liked it.

12:34.796 --> 12:35.785
(SIGHS)

12:37.382 --> 12:38.792
What can I do
for you, sir?

12:40.218 --> 12:44.211
I'm here to take
Travis back to Piron
for processing.

12:44.348 --> 12:46.179
(CHUCKLES)
Don't be so surprised.

12:46.850 --> 12:48.932
You and I both know
that our friend in lockup

12:49.019 --> 12:52.511
pushes the limits
of biology in a way
that begs investigation.

12:53.732 --> 12:56.223
Kellog knows more than
he's willing to tell me.

12:56.318 --> 12:57.353
I can live with that,

12:58.236 --> 13:01.364
but I wanted to give
you a chance to tell
me what you know

13:01.448 --> 13:02.858
and how this
connects to Kiera.

13:08.038 --> 13:09.244
(EXHALES)

13:15.462 --> 13:16.918
Kiera, Kellog, and Liber8,

13:17.005 --> 13:19.963
they were sent back
in time from the future
to change history.

13:29.226 --> 13:31.387
(LAUGHING)
Okay, that's a good one.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.062
You understand
why I had to ask?

13:41.822 --> 13:43.107
Are you okay?

13:47.327 --> 13:49.534
I was looking for a way
to be relevant.

13:50.580 --> 13:53.572
After I realized my body
was going to be a liability,

13:54.501 --> 13:56.958
my pride did not allow me
to deal with the truth.

14:00.882 --> 14:01.871
Until now.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.551
It's a recording I found
that's going to help you

14:07.639 --> 14:09.755
lay charges
in the Escher murder.

14:11.685 --> 14:12.674
(BEEPS)

14:13.937 --> 14:15.302
MATTHEW: (ON RECORDER)
We ’re in this together.

14:15.439 --> 14:17.395
EMILY: Sure, you get me
to kill Escher for you...

14:17.482 --> 14:18.642
But we ’re in this together.

14:18.734 --> 14:21.646
MATTHEW: You do this,
and you’re free of me.
(EMILY CHUCKLES)

14:21.737 --> 14:23.477
EMILY: Escher used
to say that, too.

14:23.572 --> 14:26.905
MATTHEW: Once you pull
the trigger, it’ll
finally be true.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.991
You can get Kellog on
conspiracy to commit murder.

14:30.078 --> 14:33.616
All you have to do
is offer Emily a deal
to testify against him.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.413
Let's bury
this son of a bitch.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.419
Are you sure about this?

14:38.670 --> 14:41.127
You tell your partner
I'm walking out of the cave.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.792
With all her mysteries
and missteps,

14:43.884 --> 14:46.000
she's always trying to
do the right thing.

14:46.803 --> 14:47.792
It's time I did the same.

14:50.057 --> 14:54.141
So, I will be back to deal
with this Travis thing.

14:55.645 --> 14:56.634
I hope I can count on you.

15:12.287 --> 15:13.493
I'm reprogramming it.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.911
The way the time ball
uses the soldier's

15:14.998 --> 15:16.829
power source is new, but

15:16.917 --> 15:19.408
the brakes
and the steering wheel
are all the same.

15:19.503 --> 15:20.834
Except not really.

15:21.922 --> 15:24.459
Well, you only get
to use the brakes once.

15:26.009 --> 15:29.843
In the future, my future,
if I ever get back,

15:30.430 --> 15:31.840
there are no guarantees.

15:36.561 --> 15:38.222
He may not even be.

15:40.315 --> 15:42.397
I thought you were optimistic
about Brad helping us.

15:44.694 --> 15:48.027
He asked me the questions
I'm afraid to ask myself.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.866
Well, you can
always stay here.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.542
(CHUCKLES) Thanks.

16:07.592 --> 16:09.253
(INAUDIBLE)

16:15.517 --> 16:16.848
Don't stop now.

16:26.570 --> 16:27.810
Where's my key, Tonkin?

16:29.072 --> 16:31.279
She has agreed to return it.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.357
In exchange for what?

16:33.451 --> 16:34.987
Doesn't matter.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.443
What she wants,
no one can give her.

16:36.538 --> 16:37.573
Mmm-hmm.

16:39.541 --> 16:41.998
Why does Kellog
want to come here,
to this time?

16:42.836 --> 16:45.122
He said it was
a turning point.

16:45.213 --> 16:47.750
A time when choices
could still be made
and have an impact.

16:47.966 --> 16:49.672
(CHUCKLES)

16:49.759 --> 16:51.420
I don't think there's
any right choice.

16:53.972 --> 16:55.928
You'll feel differently

16:56.016 --> 16:59.053
when you see your sister
and nephews come
through that portal.

16:59.769 --> 17:02.181
I want to see them,
I really do.

17:02.272 --> 17:05.184
But I would give
everything I have
to go back to 2035.

17:05.275 --> 17:07.061
Yeah, we all have our dates,

17:07.152 --> 17:09.609
outcomes we'd like
to change. But this...

17:11.615 --> 17:13.071
Is a one-way flight.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.865
How can you be sure?

17:17.329 --> 17:20.071
Commander spent years
trying to build
forward travel.

17:20.624 --> 17:22.580
He could see the writing
on the wall.

17:23.543 --> 17:27.707
He knew that time travel
would be the weapon
that leveled everything.

17:28.006 --> 17:30.088
Never cracked it.

17:30.175 --> 17:31.790
He told you this?

17:32.469 --> 17:33.709
I have my date, too.

17:34.721 --> 17:35.961
2032.

17:37.265 --> 17:39.847
Two children, a wife.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.229
(MAN WHISTLES)

17:46.399 --> 17:48.014
That's it.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.064
Finished.

17:52.155 --> 17:53.395
I think I deserve a drink.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.321
Oh, ifthat's true,
we all do.

17:57.494 --> 17:59.860
Come on, Tonkin.
Join us.

18:15.011 --> 18:16.797
Will it work?

18:16.888 --> 18:19.595
That's the question
I'm afraid to ask myself.

18:19.683 --> 18:21.014
How's it all going?

18:24.187 --> 18:26.849
Come on, I thought
we're on the same team.

18:28.358 --> 18:30.724
You didn't think that
for an instant.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.810
People change all the time,

18:32.904 --> 18:35.111
and there's no time
like the present.

18:35.198 --> 18:36.404
Unless my timing
is all wrong.

18:37.367 --> 18:40.029
We're done. I need to take
the device somewhere safe.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.461
I've done my part.
How do we proceed?

18:51.548 --> 18:53.459
I'll tell you
when you need
to know.

18:53.550 --> 18:56.132
You know, there was
a time when that attitude
would have thrilled me.

18:56.219 --> 18:57.504
But I got too much
at stake now.

18:57.679 --> 19:00.421
With this?
Some thing you stole?

19:02.392 --> 19:04.883
You know how improbable
this has been?

19:04.978 --> 19:07.185
Our survival.

19:07.272 --> 19:11.140
What makes you think my life
is any less precious to me
than yours is to you?

19:11.234 --> 19:12.314
(SIRENS WAILING)
Uh, Kiera?

19:12.402 --> 19:14.609
What? Oh, Shit.

19:15.405 --> 19:16.986
I take it this isn't
part of the plan.

19:17.073 --> 19:18.062
No.

19:18.199 --> 19:20.326
Matthew Kellog,
you're under arrest...

19:20.410 --> 19:21.445
Carlos?

19:21.578 --> 19:23.409
For conspiracy
in the murder of Escher...

19:23.496 --> 19:25.111
Carlos.
AKA Marc Sadler.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.822
You have the right
to retain and instruct
council without delay.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.077
This is a big
misunderstanding.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.204
Carlos, what are you doing?

19:30.295 --> 19:32.411
Ifyou do not have a lawyer,
we can refer one to you.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.120
Was this you?
No, itwas not.

19:34.215 --> 19:36.342
Anything you say can be
used as evidence in court.

19:36.426 --> 19:38.212
Carlos, this can wait.
I need him now!

19:38.386 --> 19:40.172
No. This is murder.

19:40.263 --> 19:41.628
This is happening
right here and now.

19:41.806 --> 19:43.797
Yeah, but the thing is
we sort of need his help.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.428
Do you understand?

19:45.518 --> 19:46.769
Do you wish to speak
to a lawyer?

19:48.438 --> 19:49.598
Call Jacqueline right away.

19:51.149 --> 19:53.140
I'll take care of it.

19:53.234 --> 19:54.690
Ma'am, please step back.

19:54.778 --> 19:57.019
You're going to regret
this, Carlos.

19:57.113 --> 19:58.614
I can promise you that.

20:06.748 --> 20:08.830
(SIGHS) I've waited
a long time to do that.

20:08.917 --> 20:09.952
If you would
just listen to me...

20:10.043 --> 20:13.001
Save it, Kiera.
I serve the public good,
not private concerns.

20:13.088 --> 20:14.624
You should know that by now.

20:40.532 --> 20:41.692
Oh good, you're still here.

20:42.492 --> 20:45.780
I probably got half an hour
or so down here.

20:46.037 --> 20:49.746
Um, you... You could try
to recruit me to that
organization of yours.

20:49.833 --> 20:51.789
Um...
(SNAPS FINGERS) Liber8?

20:57.507 --> 20:58.496
(SIGHS)

20:59.217 --> 21:00.332
I'll call you back.

21:01.845 --> 21:03.506
What evidence?

21:03.596 --> 21:06.554
An audio recording
of Kellog ordering
the hit on Escher.

21:07.392 --> 21:08.472
Did Dillon bring it to you?

21:10.645 --> 21:13.933
So, it's selfish
if I want to wait,

21:14.023 --> 21:17.515
but it's not selfish
if you're trying
to save Dillon.

21:17.861 --> 21:18.896
That's not what this is about.

21:18.987 --> 21:20.648
Then I guess it has nothing
to do with me leaving, either.

21:20.738 --> 21:21.727
(SCOFFS)

21:23.241 --> 21:26.654
Carlos, I know you see
this as a suicide mission.

21:27.370 --> 21:28.359
I do.

21:28.496 --> 21:30.361
But that is
my choice to make.

21:30.498 --> 21:31.453
Great. I'm not stopping you.

21:31.541 --> 21:33.406
That's exactly
what you're doing.

21:33.501 --> 21:35.708
No. Kiera, we're partners.

21:35.795 --> 21:36.955
We're supposed to
have each other's back.

21:37.046 --> 21:38.172
I didn't even know
you wanted to leave

21:38.256 --> 21:39.712
until circumstances
forced you to tell me.

21:39.799 --> 21:43.166
Until I could be sure.
Also, my choice.

21:43.261 --> 21:44.626
Yeah, well, your choices?

21:44.721 --> 21:47.383
They have an impact
on the people in your life.

21:47.557 --> 21:50.048
You need to take
responsibility,
notjust for yourself.

21:50.143 --> 21:52.259
I have honored
my responsibility to others.

21:52.395 --> 21:54.477
(SCOFFS)
This department, this city.

21:54.564 --> 21:56.020
Dillon, you, Alec.

21:56.107 --> 21:58.519
I have done right
by all of you.

21:58.610 --> 21:59.850
Yes, yes, you have done that.

21:59.944 --> 22:01.980
But you've also done
whatever the hell
you wanted to

22:02.071 --> 22:03.356
when it suits you.

22:04.574 --> 22:05.689
This is different.

22:06.451 --> 22:07.941
You hear yourself, right?

22:08.620 --> 22:10.360
You want me to release Kellog.

22:10.788 --> 22:13.279
You know what he's done,
you know what he's capable of,

22:13.625 --> 22:15.490
and yet you still
want him free.

22:23.426 --> 22:24.461
Listen, I'm...

22:25.595 --> 22:27.426
I'm sorry about Sonya,
by the way.

22:29.641 --> 22:30.676
And Lucas.

22:33.269 --> 22:34.930
ls Garza still alive?

22:38.274 --> 22:41.983
It's hard to believe
you were once one of us.

22:42.070 --> 22:43.310
What are you
talking about?

22:43.947 --> 22:46.279
I'm the embodiment of what
Liber8 was fighting for.

22:47.784 --> 22:49.149
Choice.

22:49.410 --> 22:50.695
Self-determination.

22:52.789 --> 22:53.778
Freedom.

22:55.083 --> 22:57.244
Who better represents
those virtues than me?

22:57.335 --> 22:59.747
It's what you do
with those virtues.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.545
Sonya.

23:03.633 --> 23:05.715
Lucas.

23:05.802 --> 23:08.214
Jowarski. Kagame.

23:09.556 --> 23:11.342
They built a legacy.

23:11.432 --> 23:14.014
Tens of thousands more
who won't suffer and die

23:14.102 --> 23:15.967
because we changed
that future.

23:16.104 --> 23:17.184
What about you?

23:18.773 --> 23:22.812
What will they say about
Travis Verta at the end?

23:23.861 --> 23:25.237
Hmm.

23:26.155 --> 23:28.487
"He killed like no other.

23:30.827 --> 23:34.445
"He terrorized
with the best of them."

23:36.082 --> 23:39.290
He'll be out on bail
in 24 hours and all of this
will be for nothing.

23:39.377 --> 23:40.583
Oh, Iwouldn't bet on it.

23:42.255 --> 23:43.415
ls Kellog the only one
you're arresting?

23:43.506 --> 23:45.747
Oh, right on cue.
Special interest number two.

23:45.842 --> 23:46.831
Are you going to arrest Emily?

23:46.926 --> 23:48.587
If I knew where she was.

23:48.678 --> 23:50.669
Now, I could compel you
to give me her location

23:50.763 --> 23:52.139
or you could
just be a good citizen.

23:52.223 --> 23:54.600
Carlos, he doesn't know.
I don't.

23:54.684 --> 23:56.970
And you can't trust Kellog
to tell the truth
about her involvement.

23:57.061 --> 23:58.597
I have evidence.

24:01.858 --> 24:03.439
Kellog blackmailed her.

24:03.526 --> 24:04.891
My father did, too.

24:05.278 --> 24:06.484
Well, then we'll have to
find that out.

24:06.571 --> 24:08.436
Oh, yeah, justice.
That always gets
to the truth.

24:08.531 --> 24:11.068
Justice, you know, even if
that's only a concept,

24:11.159 --> 24:12.148
that's all that I've got.

24:12.243 --> 24:14.234
And it works great for those
who can afford to buy it.

24:14.370 --> 24:16.986
Well, isn't that what
you're trying to do? Huh?

24:17.874 --> 24:20.081
You know, I've tried
to protect you and Kiera
along the way,

24:20.168 --> 24:21.829
but Kellog had
your father murdered.

24:22.253 --> 24:23.709
Okay? I don't get
to look the other way.

24:24.047 --> 24:28.006
Not for Kiera,
not for Kellog,
and not for Travis.

24:28.092 --> 24:30.378
What about Travis?

24:30.720 --> 24:32.756
They'll say,
"Travis Verta,

24:33.473 --> 24:35.134
"he was the key.

24:35.892 --> 24:40.101
"The key to unlocking

41:30.489 --> 41:31.979
Did we lose Travis?

41:32.658 --> 41:33.647
Yeah.

41:35.285 --> 41:38.368
Yeah, he helped
save a lot of lives,
including mine.

41:38.580 --> 41:41.617
He had a chance
to walk. He didn't.

41:43.293 --> 41:46.831
You know, Nora's going to
have a lot of questions.

41:46.922 --> 41:49.038
I'm not sure we have
the answers for her.

41:49.883 --> 41:51.589
I'll take the heat.

41:53.428 --> 41:54.588
Alec, give us a sec,
would you?

41:55.013 --> 41:56.674
Yeah, sure thing.

41:59.643 --> 42:01.008
What the hell
happened to Kellog?

42:02.104 --> 42:03.184
I had to let him go.

42:03.605 --> 42:05.561
God damn it, Kiera.
I had no choice.

42:06.942 --> 42:09.308
Brad was holding
Alec at gunpoint.

42:09.403 --> 42:10.734
You wanted
Kellog in the wind.

42:11.321 --> 42:13.403
At least that was
the play earlier today.

42:14.282 --> 42:17.365
What I said,
about wanting to see Sam,

42:18.662 --> 42:20.527
nothing has ever been
truer for me.

42:21.581 --> 42:22.616
But every one of us

42:23.250 --> 42:25.992
getting what we want
when we want it?

42:26.086 --> 42:28.372
I know it doesn't
work that way.

42:32.050 --> 42:33.790
I don't want to lose you.

42:35.011 --> 42:39.471
And sometimes,
I don't want to go, either.

42:41.518 --> 42:42.803
(CHUCKLES)

42:42.894 --> 42:44.976
Well, with the way
things are playing out,

42:45.063 --> 42:47.224
we may be stuck
with each other for good.

42:49.776 --> 42:51.391
Can't you just give up
this fantasy, okay?

42:51.486 --> 42:54.319
Come back to reality,
as hard as that may be?

42:54.406 --> 42:57.990
Whatever your plan was,
Brad blew it apart
when he blew this place up.

42:58.493 --> 43:00.609
Okay? I'm going to
destroy the asshole

43:00.787 --> 43:02.027
that did this to me
and my people,

43:02.122 --> 43:06.206
so you tell me
where he is right now.
