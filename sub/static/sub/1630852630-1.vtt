01:23.150 --> 01:24.418
What the hell is that?

01:31.458 --> 01:33.528
What's going on?

01:34.696 --> 01:36.363
Port side engine's on fire.

01:36.396 --> 01:37.732
Go back to your seat.

01:40.702 --> 01:42.369
Controls aren't responding.

01:46.541 --> 01:48.543
Brace for impact!

04:06.748 --> 04:11.519
At 0130, a C-47,
alongside its 10-man crew,

04:11.552 --> 04:15.022
disappeared 80 miles
south of Stuttgart.

04:21.729 --> 04:22.930
So...

04:25.499 --> 04:30.705
We've been tasked
with checking it out.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.006
- Hey, get the gear.
- Move out.

04:32.974 --> 04:34.474
Go, go, go, go, go.

04:34.509 --> 04:37.545
Korsky, Hoyte,
Gardner, Castle, move.

04:37.578 --> 04:38.579
Get to work.

04:38.613 --> 04:40.748
Simms, rear!

04:40.782 --> 04:42.482
Hey, we found
some clips of Swedish...

04:42.517 --> 04:45.720
Everyone else,
keep your goddamn ears open.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.855
Vehicle, six o'clock!

04:59.767 --> 05:00.835
Easy, Sergeant.

05:03.370 --> 05:04.471
Fuck.

05:06.406 --> 05:09.544
Son of a fucking...
Major Johnson.

05:10.678 --> 05:11.712
What a surprise.

05:13.014 --> 05:16.117
I was told you were
running operations

05:16.150 --> 05:19.520
from a chateau
outside of Reims, sir.

05:19.554 --> 05:21.354
Yeah, well, I guess
I got a little tired

05:21.388 --> 05:25.593
of eating frog legs
and foie gras.

05:25.626 --> 05:29.362
Well, I just hope you didn't
make the drive in vain, sir.

05:29.396 --> 05:31.032
Hey, come on.

05:31.065 --> 05:33.501
You know, Sergeant,
a conductor needs to just

05:33.534 --> 05:35.770
come to the orchestra pit
for some time.

05:35.803 --> 05:38.506
You know, from time
to time, brother.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.141
Mm.

05:40.174 --> 05:44.477
Yeah, but this ain't no opera,
and these ain't no violins.

05:44.512 --> 05:47.447
They just happen to make
sweet music of their own.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.886
Come on, you think you
could pick it up a little?

05:54.155 --> 05:58.793
Well, I think it's time I
introduce you to someone.

05:58.826 --> 06:02.395
Walsh is an old pupil of
mine from back in Texas.

06:02.429 --> 06:05.398
He's also quite literally
the only man for the job.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.702
I got 12 men already,

06:07.735 --> 06:10.437
and you know 13
ain't a lucky number.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.477
You know that plane went
down behind enemy lines,

06:17.511 --> 06:22.415
and it was carrying
sensitive material.

06:22.449 --> 06:25.553
And Walsh is going to be
riding with you to retrieve it.

06:25.586 --> 06:29.857
My team doesn't need outside
help recovering cargo, sir.

06:29.891 --> 06:30.958
Disobeying orders.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.595
That's a court martial offense.

06:36.197 --> 06:39.567
Yeah, but if I'm in jail,

06:39.600 --> 06:42.136
who's gonna do your
dirty work, huh?

06:42.169 --> 06:44.205
It's nice to see
you haven't changed.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.141
It's great catching up,
Sergeant.

06:47.174 --> 06:48.643
It's always such a
pleasure to see you.

06:50.144 --> 06:53.480
Well, but as you know,
time is of the essence.

06:56.951 --> 06:58.819
Watch your step.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.493
Come here.

07:12.566 --> 07:16.537
Don't just stand
around, we got work, man.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.005
You ever whacked any Jerries?

07:20.107 --> 07:23.077
Depends on your definition
of whacked, sir.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.846
Christ, just keeps
getting better and better.

07:28.516 --> 07:30.751
All right, listen up, boys.

07:30.785 --> 07:32.019
We're gonna find that wreckage

07:32.053 --> 07:33.821
and we're gonna
patch up who we can,

07:33.854 --> 07:36.557
and we're gonna let this
guy sift through the rest.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.028
Let's move out!

07:41.062 --> 07:42.495
Keep moving,
come on, hey.

07:53.107 --> 07:56.143
You know, when we
were at Marseilles,

07:56.177 --> 07:58.713
I pulled Brewer
from a burning APC.

08:00.114 --> 08:03.184
Two of his men were
still trapped inside.

08:03.217 --> 08:05.519
Bastards, they were screaming,

08:05.553 --> 08:06.787
and before I could get to them,

08:06.821 --> 08:09.790
a Stuka swooped
down out of nowhere,

08:09.824 --> 08:12.126
and well, what can I say,

08:12.159 --> 08:14.895
there was nothing left but
a crater where they'd been.

08:18.099 --> 08:21.836
<i>Brewer still despises me
for it.</i>

08:21.869 --> 08:24.071
<i>He'd rather die a
thousand deaths himself</i>

08:24.105 --> 08:26.774
than lose a single damn soldier.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.811
That's the kind of man he is.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.949
And I'll tell you what, I sure
wish we had more like him.

08:34.982 --> 08:37.218
All right, all right,
waterproof your gear,

08:37.251 --> 08:38.786
we're taking the scenic route.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.254
Yes, Sarge.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.723
All right, wait,
fuck, just wait.

08:42.757 --> 08:44.158
Come on, get those
tubs and a whetstone.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.793
Walsh, tell me.

08:48.863 --> 08:52.700
What makes this sensitive
material so special they need a,

08:52.733 --> 08:55.102
an entire squad dedicated to it?

08:55.136 --> 08:58.906
I don't ask about what
they send me to retrieve.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.941
- And why is that?
- Keep moving, come on.

09:00.975 --> 09:03.344
Well, if I'm captured, that
way it's impossible for them

09:03.377 --> 09:05.246
to get anything out of me,

09:05.279 --> 09:07.248
no matter how much
they torture me.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.187
Come on, hurry up.

09:32.273 --> 09:34.241
This just arrived
from command, sir.

09:34.275 --> 09:36.143
Let's have some
coffee first, huh?

09:36.177 --> 09:37.645
Sir, yes sir.

09:46.353 --> 09:49.590
- Quit moving around!
- Flatten it out!

10:20.354 --> 10:22.756
We'll search this quad first.

10:22.790 --> 10:24.225
Make our way to high ground.

10:25.059 --> 10:26.160
All right.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.294
Then scan from there.

10:30.097 --> 10:32.333
I wanna find this
crash site before nightfall.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.238
Come on, let's move out.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.890
Oh, shit.

11:17.378 --> 11:19.747
Well, you certainly know you're
back in the thick of things

11:19.780 --> 11:23.918
when the lukewarm dirt
passes for coffee.

11:25.986 --> 11:31.292
Listen, this operation's
been designated top secret.

11:31.325 --> 11:34.195
Anything you hear or see
from this point forward

11:34.228 --> 11:36.197
is not to leave this tent.

11:36.230 --> 11:37.798
You get my drift?

11:37.831 --> 11:39.266
Yes, sir.

11:39.300 --> 11:40.334
Understood, sir.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.904
I'm curious, though.

11:43.938 --> 11:46.340
You have some of the best
surveyors in the world

11:46.373 --> 11:47.975
at your disposal.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.076
Why bring me in?

11:51.312 --> 11:53.781
Well, I hear your
German is impeccable.

11:53.814 --> 11:56.784
My PhD thesis was
on dialect diversity

11:56.817 --> 11:59.019
of ancient Germanic tribes.

11:59.053 --> 12:01.523
Well then, let's put it
to the test, shall we?

12:13.535 --> 12:15.469
I want you to listen up.

12:15.503 --> 12:18.339
Our codebreaker's been
analyzing a transmission

12:18.372 --> 12:20.174
recorded by OSS.

12:26.480 --> 12:27.915
Okay.

12:27.948 --> 12:30.518
Right here,
what are they saying?

12:30.552 --> 12:32.419
Just a bunch of
random numbers, sir.

12:32.453 --> 12:33.921
No, no, no, no.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.389
The voice in the
background, the woman.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.124
I will play it at a half speed.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.064
Sounds like...

12:45.299 --> 12:50.004
Sounds like <i>Baum des Lebens.</i>

12:50.037 --> 12:53.207
<i>Baum des Lebens,</i>
what does that mean?

12:53.240 --> 12:54.775
Tree of life.

13:01.215 --> 13:02.283
Tree of life.

13:21.335 --> 13:22.570
Sarge.

13:22.604 --> 13:24.438
Sarge, can I wipe
my ass with this

13:24.471 --> 13:26.907
when we run out of toilet paper?

13:42.189 --> 13:43.257
Did our guys do it?

13:44.592 --> 13:45.926
No way.

13:46.460 --> 13:47.995
SAS, maybe.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.431
The Brits wouldn't do
this, or the French,

13:50.464 --> 13:52.366
and the Russians
ain't this far west.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.442
Luger, nine millimeter.

14:01.475 --> 14:03.410
Krauts did this to their own?

14:04.912 --> 14:06.581
I bet these men were deserters.

14:14.455 --> 14:16.423
You know what I say?

14:16.457 --> 14:18.526
The Krauts start killing Krauts,

14:18.560 --> 14:20.595
sit back and enjoy
the fireworks.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.140
Taft.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.008
Let the Jerry rot in peace.

14:38.546 --> 14:39.480
Take cover!

14:54.729 --> 14:58.966
Don't worry, it's okay to
piss yourself the first time!

15:02.570 --> 15:04.204
Korsky!

15:04.238 --> 15:05.272
Go.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.007
Thoretti!

15:09.209 --> 15:10.210
Cover fire!

15:10.244 --> 15:12.647
- Go, get in there.
- Go!

15:39.641 --> 15:41.175
Clear!

15:51.418 --> 15:52.687
Gardner.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.556
Ask him how many
are still out there.

15:59.627 --> 16:01.228
Hey, easy, man, easy.

16:02.029 --> 16:03.163
Can I look?

16:18.078 --> 16:19.446
Come on, boy,
speak English.

16:19.480 --> 16:22.115
Shell shock due
to severe trauma.

16:22.149 --> 16:24.017
I've seen this before.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.653
Beat him all you want,
he ain't saying a word.

16:25.687 --> 16:27.555
Yeah, he shoots well
for severe trauma.

16:27.589 --> 16:29.490
Get him up, he's coming with us.

16:35.362 --> 16:36.764
Sergeant?

16:36.798 --> 16:38.298
What's the problem, Walsh?

16:39.534 --> 16:41.101
Forget to get shot?

17:39.426 --> 17:41.094
I hope you get over
your trauma soon,

17:41.128 --> 17:43.531
you limey son of a bitch.

17:43.565 --> 17:45.499
Sure it's wise to
take him with us?

17:45.533 --> 17:47.301
I'll find a use for him.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.436
He'll give away our position
first chance he gets.

17:49.469 --> 17:52.339
You just worry about that
plane we need to find, huh?

18:38.185 --> 18:40.521
You and Rucker check it out.

19:13.821 --> 19:15.222
Right there.

19:24.766 --> 19:26.567
Yeah, check it out.

19:54.629 --> 19:56.229
It's nothing, let's go.

19:56.263 --> 19:57.330
Let's go.

20:09.043 --> 20:11.512
Holy fucking fruit.

20:11.546 --> 20:12.847
Let's go.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.483
Let's go!

20:23.323 --> 20:24.992
Okay, yeah.

20:28.062 --> 20:28.996
Oh shit!

20:32.867 --> 20:35.837
Who... who the hell
are those women?

20:35.870 --> 20:38.405
They're civilians,
they hide up here from us.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.842
Their husbands are off
fighting the war somewhere.

20:40.875 --> 20:43.578
I never seen
civilians like that before.

20:43.611 --> 20:45.412
Not even in France.

20:45.445 --> 20:46.914
Oh, you haven't been
laid in a long time, Ruck.

20:46.948 --> 20:48.448
Maybe you never have.

20:48.482 --> 20:49.984
You kidding me?

20:50.017 --> 20:50.852
I used to get it all the
time back home in Sweden.

20:50.885 --> 20:51.819
Yeah, right.

20:54.922 --> 20:57.892
- Women?
- Absolute knockouts.

20:59.527 --> 21:00.460
The redhead, man.

21:03.731 --> 21:07.802
She got this gorgeous body
with two perfectly round...

21:07.835 --> 21:09.737
At ease, Rucker.

21:14.809 --> 21:16.476
But sorry, Chief,

21:16.511 --> 21:17.645
them girls might know
where the plane went down.

21:17.678 --> 21:19.412
Yeah, he's right, Sarge.

21:19.446 --> 21:20.715
Me and Simms here, we can
use our interrogation skills

21:20.748 --> 21:22.049
from Paris, you know?

21:22.083 --> 21:23.951
My zook's loaded and
ready to fire, man.

21:25.052 --> 21:27.354
We got a man down.

21:27.387 --> 21:28.990
We're not gonna
risk our position

21:30.024 --> 21:32.292
to mess with civvies, got it?

21:32.960 --> 21:34.028
- Got it.
- Yeah.

21:35.797 --> 21:37.064
You got a problem, Walsh?

21:41.769 --> 21:42.837
No, sir.

21:44.071 --> 21:45.372
Let's move.

22:02.857 --> 22:06.661
So I'm thinking about asking
Sarge for a one night pass.

22:07.595 --> 22:08.996
Dream on, Ruck.

22:09.030 --> 22:10.731
Are you telling me you
wouldn't wanna ride

22:10.765 --> 22:11.999
one of them moaning girls?

22:19.807 --> 22:21.776
We got married two
days before I shipped.

22:23.010 --> 22:24.779
Look at this.

22:24.812 --> 22:27.982
She's two already,
and I never held her once.

22:28.015 --> 22:29.951
I ain't betraying my
family for some Nazi whore.

22:29.984 --> 22:32.587
Ooh, Nazi whore.

22:34.121 --> 22:35.756
I like the sound of that.

22:47.068 --> 22:49.136
What the hell?

22:52.673 --> 22:54.942
This don't make a
shit worth of sense.

22:54.976 --> 22:57.778
We've been following
that contour for an hour.

22:57.812 --> 22:59.446
Now we're in the same spot?

23:06.854 --> 23:08.856
There's no way the sun is north.

23:08.890 --> 23:11.926
We must be in the middle of
some, some kind of magnetic ore.

23:13.628 --> 23:15.663
It could be what
took down the plane.

23:15.696 --> 23:16.831
What?

23:18.132 --> 23:21.102
It could be what
took down the plane.

23:21.135 --> 23:23.771
When Odysseus entered
the land of the dead,

23:25.539 --> 23:26.908
the demons,
they changed the stars

23:26.941 --> 23:28.676
so he would lose direction.

23:30.044 --> 23:32.513
What kind of fufu
gibberish is that, Walsh?

23:33.547 --> 23:34.481
It's Greek mythology.

23:34.515 --> 23:37.118
Okay, do me a favor.

23:37.151 --> 23:40.855
You keep your goddamn poetry
to yourself, all right?

23:40.888 --> 23:42.489
Somebody's been here
after we left.

23:52.767 --> 23:54.467
Well, it takes wolves
a couple hours

23:54.502 --> 23:58.940
to sniff out the grave and
start digging up the body.

23:59.807 --> 24:01.876
Olin, fire up the radio.

24:01.909 --> 24:04.211
We'll use it as a
signal to navigate.

24:04.245 --> 24:07.548
I need two volunteers
to guard the perimeter.

24:07.581 --> 24:08.916
Everyone else, 10-minute rest.

24:11.585 --> 24:13.120
I'll take the
southeast quadrant.

24:14.922 --> 24:16.090
Will you now?

24:18.793 --> 24:19.994
All right, whatever, Walsh.

24:21.062 --> 24:22.096
Carbony, your rifle.

24:23.798 --> 24:26.801
Walsh, don't make me regret it.

24:30.271 --> 24:31.973
Gotta drop a bomb.

24:33.107 --> 24:34.909
Keep right where I can see you.

24:34.942 --> 24:37.578
I'd rather get shot than have
you watch me taking a shit.

24:52.727 --> 24:54.028
<i>Sierra Echo,
this is Falcon Seven.</i>

24:54.061 --> 24:56.197
- <i>Do you copy, over.</i>
- Sarge.

25:03.337 --> 25:04.805
<i>Sierra Echo,
Major Johnson</i>

25:04.839 --> 25:06.741
<i>needs to speak with you, over.</i>

25:06.774 --> 25:08.175
Copy, Falcon Seven.

25:21.622 --> 25:22.523
It's dead, sir.

25:24.825 --> 25:28.963
<i>♪ Go on, brave Spartan ♪</i>

25:28.996 --> 25:32.133
<i>♪ You are most welcome ♪</i>

25:32.166 --> 25:36.003
<i>♪ To stay here for food ♪</i>

25:36.037 --> 25:39.940
<i>♪ So tired from trouble ♪</i>

25:39.974 --> 25:43.344
<i>♪ So weary of war ♪</i>

25:43.377 --> 25:46.614
<i>♪ Give into rest, soldier ♪</i>

25:46.647 --> 25:49.150
<i>♪ Fight no more ♪</i>

25:57.158 --> 25:59.226
I have no idea
what you're saying.

26:07.968 --> 26:11.072
Hey, you stay right
where you are.

26:22.149 --> 26:23.250
Friend?

26:50.111 --> 26:51.846
That's our bird.

26:58.819 --> 26:59.954
Damn.

27:04.191 --> 27:06.694
Now would you
believe if I told you

27:06.727 --> 27:08.896
I've never done this before?

27:47.868 --> 27:49.870
<i>This is Captain Rice.</i>

27:49.904 --> 27:50.971
<i>Everyone else is dead.</i>

27:54.108 --> 27:55.409
Captain Rice?

27:57.512 --> 28:00.381
Captain, can you hear me?

28:04.051 --> 28:05.419
Do you copy me?

28:05.452 --> 28:07.788
<i>Captain Rice?</i>

28:07.821 --> 28:09.390
<i>Captain, can you hear me?</i>

28:17.031 --> 28:18.799
Oh no, dear god.

28:20.000 --> 28:20.868
First section, let's move!

28:32.346 --> 28:33.981
Please help me!

28:35.382 --> 28:36.450
Help me.

28:53.033 --> 28:54.401
Don't kill me.

28:55.537 --> 28:57.805
- Walsh.
- Yeah, at ease, G.I.

28:57.838 --> 28:59.974
What the hell are you doing?

29:01.342 --> 29:02.743
I heard a shot.

29:06.447 --> 29:08.048
Why'd you discharge your weapon?

29:08.082 --> 29:09.783
I ain't telling you shit.

29:09.817 --> 29:11.118
You ain't the sarge.

29:11.151 --> 29:12.386
But I am.

29:20.160 --> 29:22.796
Walsh put a knife
to my throat, sir.

29:22.830 --> 29:23.931
Almost killed me.

29:25.966 --> 29:27.334
Walsh?

29:27.368 --> 29:29.937
Your man, he fired his weapon,
he charged the squad.

29:29.970 --> 29:31.972
I'm not taking any chances.

29:34.875 --> 29:36.977
What were you
firing at, Private?

29:38.946 --> 29:40.447
I was charged by a wild pig.

29:44.985 --> 29:47.288
What were you doing
out there anyway?

29:50.024 --> 29:51.158
I...

29:53.528 --> 29:55.296
I found the plane, sir.

30:05.939 --> 30:06.874
Good job, Private.

30:07.941 --> 30:08.976
Let's move!

30:19.320 --> 30:22.923
I thought you said you didn't
have any combat experience.

30:22.956 --> 30:24.958
Well, I never said that.

30:24.992 --> 30:27.928
I guess maybe you
just assumed it?

30:27.961 --> 30:30.364
Then how'd you learn to
take down a man like that?

30:33.967 --> 30:35.135
Burma.

30:35.903 --> 30:37.104
Hey, Walsh.

30:39.940 --> 30:41.576
I really don't
care how many Japs

30:41.609 --> 30:43.377
you bushwhacked in the jungle.

30:43.410 --> 30:46.046
You do that to one
of my men again,

30:46.080 --> 30:47.915
you're gonna answer to me.

31:11.438 --> 31:12.640
It's just wild boars.

31:14.542 --> 31:17.244
Sounded like one of
Rucker's potato farts.

31:17.277 --> 31:18.646
Remember D-Day, Bo?

31:18.680 --> 31:19.647
Yeah, I thought
we were gonna die

31:19.681 --> 31:21.181
before we hit the beach.

31:28.656 --> 31:29.957
Let's move.

31:48.075 --> 31:49.943
Friar, north perimeter.

31:49.977 --> 31:52.112
Rucker south, rest of
you sweep for survivors.

31:53.480 --> 31:55.115
Walsh, do what
you came here for.

32:49.504 --> 32:51.171
Sergeant.

32:51.205 --> 32:53.508
There were 11 flyboys on
this bird when it crashed.

33:00.047 --> 33:03.551
There should be bodies,
or parts of them anyway.

33:03.585 --> 33:06.053
Krauts must have got
in here before we did,

33:06.086 --> 33:07.655
took all the bodies away.

33:07.689 --> 33:11.759
No, it wasn't the Germans,
that's for sure.

33:11.793 --> 33:13.661
Oh, I almost forgot.

33:13.695 --> 33:15.329
We got an expert in our midst.

33:16.698 --> 33:18.733
If the Nazis had been here, sir,

33:18.766 --> 33:20.434
they wouldn't have left this.

33:22.302 --> 33:25.372
Okay, we found the plane,
we found the secret stuff.

33:25.405 --> 33:26.406
Can we go home now?

33:28.208 --> 33:29.577
We're not going anywhere.

33:31.613 --> 33:33.480
If there's a, even
the slightest chance

33:33.515 --> 33:35.683
that one of these
flyboys is still alive,

33:38.720 --> 33:40.354
I'm not leaving them behind.

33:43.123 --> 33:44.526
Sarge.

33:45.560 --> 33:46.694
This way.

34:33.841 --> 34:35.375
Ah, Jesus.

34:35.409 --> 34:36.611
You okay, man?

34:36.644 --> 34:38.680
Yeah, okay.

34:38.713 --> 34:39.781
Sarge.

34:40.648 --> 34:41.783
Sarge.

34:45.252 --> 34:47.522
Simms!

35:16.684 --> 35:18.820
Captain Rice.

35:18.853 --> 35:20.922
USAF.

35:40.340 --> 35:41.475
Morgan.

35:42.242 --> 35:43.410
Check him out.

35:49.617 --> 35:50.752
He's dead, sir.

35:51.786 --> 35:53.788
I said check him out.

35:58.726 --> 36:00.762
The Japs got to him.

36:00.795 --> 36:02.496
That ain't
Japanese, you idiot.

36:02.530 --> 36:03.463
Then what is it?

36:04.932 --> 36:08.368
Bird, tree, death.

36:08.402 --> 36:10.337
Ancient magical symbols.

36:10.370 --> 36:11.271
Cut him open.

36:13.941 --> 36:15.275
- I'll do it.
- Do it.

36:25.252 --> 36:26.721
I heard stories
about Nazi doctors

36:26.754 --> 36:28.422
doing this kind of thing.

36:28.455 --> 36:31.859
You know, medical experiments,
mutilations, drugs.

36:35.029 --> 36:36.964
Had enough of this bullshit.

36:36.998 --> 36:41.769
This man, he has
no internal organs.

36:41.803 --> 36:42.837
In Haiti they use feathers

36:42.870 --> 36:44.706
to bring back the dead and shit.

36:45.707 --> 36:47.274
It's called hoodoo or something.

36:47.307 --> 36:48.609
Stop that crap right now.

36:51.979 --> 36:53.881
All right.

36:53.915 --> 36:55.817
You fellas wanna
know what's going on?

36:57.985 --> 37:00.521
We got all the
answers right here.

37:00.555 --> 37:01.656
Right here.

37:06.027 --> 37:09.564
You start talking
or you start eating.

37:13.935 --> 37:15.903
<i>Hexen.</i>

37:15.937 --> 37:18.271
- <i>Hexen.</i>
- What does <i>hexen</i> mean?

37:19.507 --> 37:20.808
Witches, sir.

37:21.809 --> 37:22.810
You fellas are right.

37:24.311 --> 37:26.379
Should have shot him
right on the spot.

37:26.413 --> 37:27.782
I'll do
him right now, Sarge,

37:27.815 --> 37:28.616
- just say the word.
- No, no, it's too late.

37:28.649 --> 37:29.751
Too late.

37:31.753 --> 37:32.820
Crew's dead.

37:34.922 --> 37:38.593
And I ain't going
back empty-handed.

37:41.028 --> 37:42.697
Put the dead in the ground.

37:44.464 --> 37:45.633
We're going home.

38:00.081 --> 38:01.883
What do you know?

38:20.802 --> 38:25.940
You know, in 1840,

38:25.973 --> 38:29.076
Hans Garmin, the German
national wanted in connection

38:29.110 --> 38:31.846
to dozens of missing
children in Leipzig.

38:31.879 --> 38:35.983
He was arrested trying
to enter the US,

38:36.017 --> 38:37.752
and this manuscript was found

38:37.785 --> 38:40.955
sewn into the lining
of his luggage.

38:40.988 --> 38:45.560
It's the first of
a two-volume set.

38:45.593 --> 38:48.896
You have the
second part as well, sir?

38:48.930 --> 38:50.898
Well, certainly not
for lack of trying.

38:53.534 --> 38:56.436
I've led teams across three
continents in search of it.

39:07.949 --> 39:11.384
Come here, tell me what
you make out of it.

39:11.418 --> 39:12.520
Right here.

39:14.722 --> 39:17.959
Hm.
Old High German, definitely.

39:17.992 --> 39:20.393
Well, I mean, I could
have told you that.

39:20.427 --> 39:23.164
But sir, this is the oldest
form of the Germanic language,

39:23.197 --> 39:26.399
hasn't been spoken this
way in 1,000 years.

39:30.171 --> 39:31.505
Okay.

39:37.979 --> 39:41.414
Defeating time, does that
make any sense to you, sir?

39:42.683 --> 39:46.888
Well, yeah, more than
you could imagine.

39:46.921 --> 39:48.756
No wonder that fucking
Fuhrer's agents

39:48.789 --> 39:51.692
have been scouring the area.

39:51.726 --> 39:53.661
I just hope we find
it before they do.

40:18.052 --> 40:20.688
This ain't playtime, Walsh.

40:24.992 --> 40:28.461
You gonna tell me that
after everything we've seen,

40:28.495 --> 40:32.800
nothing seems strange
to you in the slightest?

40:51.886 --> 40:55.823
Two years ago, I was in Italy.

40:57.892 --> 41:01.862
And we'd been spilling
our brains out

41:01.896 --> 41:03.898
fighting the Germans
right and left.

41:06.968 --> 41:10.571
But then, on Christmas Eve,

41:13.908 --> 41:15.509
everything got quiet.

41:17.311 --> 41:20.247
The Jerries started
playing Christmas carols

41:20.281 --> 41:21.716
on their loudspeakers.

41:23.784 --> 41:27.021
And their boys and our boys

41:28.689 --> 41:29.857
joined together.

41:34.261 --> 41:35.529
Two days later,

41:38.265 --> 41:40.768
we started blowing each
other's brains out,

41:40.801 --> 41:42.036
just like before.

41:45.339 --> 41:46.640
So, no.

41:48.776 --> 41:50.945
Nothing seems strange
to me anymore.

41:51.846 --> 41:52.913
Help dig.

42:09.130 --> 42:11.065
Rucker.

42:11.098 --> 42:15.536
Rucker, tell me what you saw
back there, at the windmill.

42:18.139 --> 42:20.608
Come on, man, I know
you saw something.

42:22.043 --> 42:23.177
Tell me what you saw.

42:24.879 --> 42:25.913
Tell me about the women.

42:37.091 --> 42:40.127
Oh, Jesus, I think
I'm gonna be sick.

42:40.161 --> 42:42.863
Easy there, easy, easy.

42:42.897 --> 42:43.898
Let me help you.

42:43.931 --> 42:45.132
Don't touch me!

42:51.038 --> 42:52.173
Rucker?

42:54.108 --> 42:55.843
Morgan, help him out.

42:55.876 --> 42:56.944
Stay back.

42:56.977 --> 42:57.978
Whoa, whoa.

42:58.012 --> 43:00.614
Stay back, or I'll shoot myself.

43:01.682 --> 43:03.217
What the hell you doing, Ruck?

43:03.250 --> 43:04.718
I'm so sorry.

43:08.689 --> 43:10.891
Come on.

43:10.925 --> 43:11.859
Stay down, stay down.

43:11.892 --> 43:13.828
Give him a shot!

43:13.861 --> 43:14.762
Stick him!

43:24.271 --> 43:27.108
Jesus Christ.

43:27.141 --> 43:29.777
I told him to stay away
from those French tarts.

43:29.810 --> 43:32.279
He didn't go with no
French tarts, Gardy.

43:32.313 --> 43:34.148
Ruck's never even
had a girlfriend.

43:35.883 --> 43:37.952
Look like it's eating his flesh.

43:37.985 --> 43:39.420
If he can't walk,
put him on a stretcher.

43:39.453 --> 43:41.188
We gotta hit that river
by nightfall.

43:41.222 --> 43:43.958
Let's finish up this
business, all right?

43:43.991 --> 43:45.025
Where is he?

43:45.059 --> 43:46.727
- Get that goddamn Jerry!
- Shit!

44:05.012 --> 44:06.780
You got one chance
to quit squirming.

44:50.758 --> 44:51.892
Oh God.

45:11.513 --> 45:12.980
Who did this?

45:20.522 --> 45:24.892
He says they
exsanguinated him,

45:24.925 --> 45:26.493
like they did to his men.

45:26.528 --> 45:28.829
Sergeant, nobody can
bleed out a man that fast.

45:30.864 --> 45:31.899
Witches can.

45:39.974 --> 45:41.842
I want a better explanation.

45:41.875 --> 45:42.876
Brewer!

45:44.311 --> 45:46.380
I really think you
should talk to Rucker.

45:53.887 --> 45:55.889
You got something you
wanna tell me, Private?

45:56.924 --> 45:59.059
More, ow, morphine.

45:59.093 --> 46:00.828
It hurts really bad.

46:00.861 --> 46:01.962
No.

46:03.565 --> 46:05.966
Not till you tell us
what you know.

46:18.012 --> 46:19.246
I shot one.

46:20.548 --> 46:22.283
What the hell you talking about?

46:23.518 --> 46:25.452
I fucked one,
and then I shot her.

46:30.124 --> 46:31.892
You shot a civilian?

46:33.561 --> 46:36.964
I, she was, she,

46:36.997 --> 46:38.966
she wasn't a civilian.

46:48.976 --> 46:51.245
She was a witch, Sarge.

46:51.278 --> 46:53.013
The hell did you do to me?

47:05.259 --> 47:06.628
Get back.

47:06.661 --> 47:10.532
As my chosen one,
you will never die.

47:10.565 --> 47:13.267
Get the hell away from me.

47:16.604 --> 47:19.273
We're never getting out
of this forest.

47:19.306 --> 47:21.041
They won't let us.

47:24.011 --> 47:25.412
All right, all right, all right.

47:25.446 --> 47:27.181
Give this fucker his morphine.

47:27.214 --> 47:28.616
Make it a triple shot,

47:28.650 --> 47:29.917
will you, huh?

47:35.389 --> 47:37.424
Bury Friar with the others.

47:39.960 --> 47:43.964
I want a defensive
position along that ridge,

47:43.997 --> 47:46.133
mined with everything
we got, okay?

48:31.311 --> 48:33.648
In five minutes,
I want you to switch over

48:33.681 --> 48:35.282
to this frequency.

48:56.738 --> 48:58.372
0321.

48:58.405 --> 49:00.608
<i>Copy, over.</i>

49:03.611 --> 49:07.047
<i>Walsh, it's
Johnson, go ahead, over.</i>

49:07.080 --> 49:09.517
I found the film, sir.

49:09.551 --> 49:11.653
We were informed that
another SS search party

49:11.686 --> 49:13.053
is currently in route.

49:16.691 --> 49:20.494
But Brewer, his squad is
really losing it, sir.

49:22.162 --> 49:23.297
This place, it...

49:25.800 --> 49:27.234
It plays tricks on the mind.

49:48.690 --> 49:51.124
Goddamn lazy surprise
sons of bitches.

49:52.059 --> 49:53.227
Fuck!

49:53.260 --> 49:54.762
I can't take it anymore,
I swear to god,

49:54.796 --> 49:56.664
I can't take another
fucking minute.

49:56.698 --> 49:57.699
Rucker's cursed us.

50:08.175 --> 50:09.577
Okay, Sarge?

50:09.611 --> 50:11.278
No, he's not okay,
none of us is okay.

50:11.311 --> 50:12.780
Shut your fucking mouth
or I will shut it for you.

50:12.814 --> 50:16.684
Sarge...
Speak to me.

50:29.429 --> 50:31.398
Sierra Echo,

50:31.431 --> 50:34.201
reading you loud
and clear, over.

50:36.571 --> 50:40.307
Four KIA, one severely infirmed.

50:40.340 --> 50:44.044
Requesting updated extraction
point due to casualties, over.

50:48.382 --> 50:50.284
Son of a bitch.

50:56.423 --> 51:00.093
Poison gas.

51:02.797 --> 51:07.702
And Major Johnson's
outdone himself this time.

51:07.735 --> 51:11.471
Treating us, acting like
fucking guinea pigs.

51:13.407 --> 51:15.375
Sir, all I heard was static.

51:16.711 --> 51:19.146
- Huh?
- I didn't hear anything either.

51:19.179 --> 51:21.214
What about you, Korsky?

51:21.248 --> 51:23.618
Sir, I heard exactly
what you heard.

51:23.651 --> 51:24.586
Bullshit!

51:26.286 --> 51:27.589
This is Sierra Echo,
do you copy me, over.

51:27.622 --> 51:29.456
The hell you think you're doing?

51:29.489 --> 51:32.159
Proving to you that
there is no one there.

51:32.192 --> 51:33.661
Base come in,
this is Sierra Echo,

51:33.695 --> 51:36.296
- do you copy me, over.
- Put the handset down.

51:36.330 --> 51:38.332
See, nothing.

51:38.365 --> 51:40.902
Hello, base command,
anyone, please,

51:40.935 --> 51:42.637
my CO has lost his fucking mind.

51:42.670 --> 51:43.738
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

51:43.771 --> 51:45.138
- whoa whoa!
- Oh Jesus.

51:46.306 --> 51:47.842
- You shot me.
- Just a graze.

51:48.710 --> 51:50.210
Next one won't be.

51:50.243 --> 51:52.412
Now sit the fuck down.

51:56.383 --> 51:59.854
Private Taft, you do
not have permission

51:59.887 --> 52:01.556
to leave this space!

52:03.825 --> 52:05.860
Anyone else wanna
question my authority?

52:07.895 --> 52:09.129
Huh?

52:10.531 --> 52:11.666
Anyone?

52:12.834 --> 52:16.470
What about you, Walsh?

52:16.504 --> 52:18.205
You hear the voice
on that radio?

52:40.895 --> 52:42.664
Oh god, please don't
kill me, please.

52:42.697 --> 52:43.865
Please.

53:09.957 --> 53:11.559
Hey.

53:11.592 --> 53:13.293
Your watch.

53:13.326 --> 53:14.896
There was only static
on that radio, Korsky,

53:14.929 --> 53:16.430
and you know it.

53:20.434 --> 53:21.903
Sarge got us through
four years of this crap

53:21.936 --> 53:23.370
without getting us shot.

53:25.940 --> 53:27.407
If he wants to hear
voices on the radio,

53:27.441 --> 53:28.976
then I'll hear them too.

53:56.003 --> 53:57.304
Come on!

54:02.710 --> 54:04.545
Is that a pig?

54:08.883 --> 54:09.917
I got one!

54:10.952 --> 54:12.620
What happened?

54:12.653 --> 54:15.388
Sarge here, he just got
us our first decent meal.

54:15.422 --> 54:16.557
Right, Sarge?

54:33.608 --> 54:35.710
Sure hope Taft's all right.

54:35.743 --> 54:37.845
Ah, he'll be fine.

54:37.879 --> 54:40.615
Had a similar incident
in Marseilles.

54:43.584 --> 54:44.852
He'll be back soon
as he gets a whiff

54:44.886 --> 54:46.386
of this good old barbecue.

54:46.419 --> 54:47.454
Mm, num num.

54:48.790 --> 54:51.058
Want me to feed the Kraut too?

54:51.092 --> 54:52.794
We all know you got a
soft spot for Krauts,

54:52.827 --> 54:54.695
ever since your mama fucked one.

54:56.631 --> 54:59.100
Don't make me kick your
ass, you son of a bitch.

54:59.133 --> 55:01.401
I'll feed the goddamn Jerry.

55:01.434 --> 55:02.502
All right.

55:03.771 --> 55:06.974
Let it be known how Americans

55:09.877 --> 55:11.512
treat their prisoners.

55:12.780 --> 55:14.582
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

55:32.667 --> 55:33.768
You knew.

55:40.842 --> 55:43.544
10 yards!

55:44.912 --> 55:46.848
One o'clock, in the trees!

55:51.018 --> 55:52.352
Sarge!

55:54.188 --> 55:55.488
Sarge?

56:10.004 --> 56:12.840
<i>No one
respects your authority.</i>

56:22.950 --> 56:24.118
<i>Everyone's against you.</i>

56:29.090 --> 56:30.625
<i>Walsh is a spy.</i>

56:33.160 --> 56:34.962
<i>They joined the enemy.</i>

56:54.181 --> 56:59.520
These things, they use
strike and retreat tactics.

56:59.553 --> 57:03.791
They slink off into the forest
the first sign of gunfire,

57:03.824 --> 57:07.962
only to come back for the
bodies once the coast is clear.

57:09.196 --> 57:10.798
They're scavengers.

57:10.831 --> 57:12.199
So bullets can hurt them then.

57:12.233 --> 57:15.536
Rucker said he shot one of them.

57:15.569 --> 57:17.939
Wake his ass up, we need
to know everything he does.

57:20.841 --> 57:21.909
Rucker, wake up.

57:23.210 --> 57:24.512
Rucker.

57:28.816 --> 57:30.017
Where is he?

57:30.051 --> 57:31.886
They're picking us off
one by one.

57:31.919 --> 57:33.254
There's nothing
we can do about it.

57:33.287 --> 57:35.222
Nah, we stay together,
all right?

57:35.256 --> 57:37.558
We take the fight to them.

57:37.591 --> 57:40.861
No more being hunted,
it's time we start hunting.

57:40.895 --> 57:42.196
No.

57:42.229 --> 57:43.731
Sergeant Brewer gave us
specific orders.

57:43.764 --> 57:46.133
Sergeant Brewer's
lost his goddamn mind.

57:46.167 --> 57:47.635
When do we start?

57:47.668 --> 57:48.769
Right now.

57:49.804 --> 57:50.871
Who's with me?

57:51.772 --> 57:52.907
Fine.

57:53.874 --> 57:54.909
Yeah.

57:57.111 --> 57:58.579
Suit up.

58:00.915 --> 58:03.617
A solar compass
consists of three arcs,

58:03.651 --> 58:06.787
latitude, declination of sun
and time of day

58:06.821 --> 58:09.056
to conduct accurate
land surveys,

58:09.090 --> 58:12.226
providing one has the
current coordinates.

58:12.259 --> 58:15.563
So, numbers on that recording,

58:15.596 --> 58:17.665
what if they're not
so random after all?

58:25.873 --> 58:27.875
I've been watching you guys.

58:32.646 --> 58:35.149
Wanted to see if you
were really gonna leave.

58:36.717 --> 58:37.818
Welcome to join us.

58:39.820 --> 58:41.222
So you're in charge now, huh?

58:45.926 --> 58:47.862
These men,
they're your men, Brewer.

58:47.895 --> 58:48.829
They care about you.

58:49.864 --> 58:50.865
Hey, Sarge.

58:54.835 --> 58:55.903
We looked for you.

58:56.837 --> 58:57.972
Then we waited.

58:59.740 --> 59:01.742
Thought maybe the gas got you.

59:03.077 --> 59:05.246
You're a terrible liar, Morgan.

59:08.049 --> 59:10.785
That was our medic!

59:10.818 --> 59:12.953
Wasn't there from the start.

59:12.987 --> 59:15.756
An outsider.

59:15.790 --> 59:16.690
He was a good man!

59:16.724 --> 59:17.925
He was a traitor!

59:17.958 --> 59:19.960
So are you, so are all of you!

59:23.097 --> 59:25.633
Sarge, I'm sorry!

59:28.235 --> 59:30.771
Hey asshole!

59:30.805 --> 59:32.773
Olin!

59:32.807 --> 59:35.276
Get back here!

59:35.309 --> 59:36.610
Olin?

59:37.244 --> 59:38.913
Olin!

59:38.946 --> 59:40.314
Come back, Olin!

59:45.186 --> 59:46.287
Olin!

59:47.421 --> 59:49.056
Olin!

59:49.090 --> 59:50.291
Where are you?

59:53.227 --> 59:54.795
Olin, come here!

59:57.765 --> 59:58.799
Olin!

1:00:28.395 --> 1:00:29.296
Please, God.

1:00:30.731 --> 1:00:31.932
I just wanna see her again.

1:00:49.083 --> 1:00:50.217
Betty?

1:00:51.752 --> 1:00:52.853
God listens.

1:00:53.988 --> 1:00:54.922
It's impossible.

1:00:55.956 --> 1:00:57.691
Do you remember our wedding day?

1:01:02.496 --> 1:01:04.732
It was the best day of my life.

1:01:04.765 --> 1:01:08.435
Do you take this woman
as your beloved wife

1:01:12.039 --> 1:01:14.175
for the rest of
your natural life?

1:01:16.911 --> 1:01:17.978
I do.

1:02:22.810 --> 1:02:24.845
Can't fight this off,
go, go, go, go, go!

1:02:44.566 --> 1:02:46.066
Shit ain't right, man.

1:02:52.239 --> 1:02:56.810

- You okay?
- Yeah.

1:05:25.459 --> 1:05:29.029
<i>It's Major Johnson,
do you copy?</i>

1:05:29.062 --> 1:05:31.131
This is Walsh, sir, over.

1:05:31.165 --> 1:05:33.200
All right, Walsh,
use a solar compass.

1:05:33.233 --> 1:05:34.702
I'll have the
coordinates for you.

1:05:51.151 --> 1:05:54.321
Where are you going, sir?

1:05:54.354 --> 1:05:56.558
I'm going to get my
boots a little dirty.

1:06:04.799 --> 1:06:06.066
Wait a minute.

1:06:09.804 --> 1:06:11.639
The windmill.

1:06:11.673 --> 1:06:13.140
It was right here, we saw it.

1:06:16.210 --> 1:06:18.479
We saw what they wanted
us to see, Freeman.

1:06:20.748 --> 1:06:24.719
Just a illusion.

1:06:24.752 --> 1:06:27.655
A projection of the real place.

1:06:27.689 --> 1:06:32.794
Which is hidden under
a concealment spell.

1:06:32.827 --> 1:06:35.429
Impossible to find unless
you have the right angle.

1:06:37.231 --> 1:06:38.265
The right time.

1:06:39.834 --> 1:06:41.001
And then...

1:06:45.707 --> 1:06:47.241
It's gotta be right there.

1:06:48.643 --> 1:06:50.210
There.

1:07:04.559 --> 1:07:05.660
Walsh.

1:07:17.304 --> 1:07:18.606
Walsh!

1:07:18.640 --> 1:07:19.741
There.

1:07:21.275 --> 1:07:22.309
There it is.

1:07:26.781 --> 1:07:28.048
Come on.

1:08:38.519 --> 1:08:40.555
Freeman, check upstairs.

1:09:15.723 --> 1:09:18.626
The complete witch's archive.

1:09:18.660 --> 1:09:21.829
The major was only ever able
to get his hands on volume one.

1:09:21.863 --> 1:09:23.463
The Nazis got part two.

1:09:25.566 --> 1:09:27.535
Last week one of our
operatives in Berlin

1:09:27.568 --> 1:09:31.706
was able to smuggle out a
photographic copy of this.

1:09:32.740 --> 1:09:34.474
So that's what was on the plane.

1:09:35.777 --> 1:09:37.612
Uh-huh.

1:09:37.645 --> 1:09:39.346
Come take a look at this.

1:09:44.752 --> 1:09:47.822
It's Latin for warrior's blood.

1:09:47.855 --> 1:09:52.292
Right here it says, "Oh tree
of life, quench thy thirst,

1:09:53.293 --> 1:09:55.262
"'til flowers burst."

1:09:57.732 --> 1:10:01.769
The witches, they were
killing the soldiers

1:10:02.770 --> 1:10:03.838
to live forever.

1:10:07.307 --> 1:10:08.743
Immortality.

1:10:08.776 --> 1:10:09.844
It's real, Freeman.

1:10:12.747 --> 1:10:15.382
If Hitler gets his
hands on this...

1:10:15.415 --> 1:10:18.653
How do you fight an army
you can't even kill?

1:10:23.591 --> 1:10:27.394
Three days ago, OSS
intercepted a transmission

1:10:27.427 --> 1:10:31.666
sent by those Germans
we found in the woods,

1:10:31.699 --> 1:10:34.501
announcing that they had
found the tree for the Fuhrer.

1:10:36.571 --> 1:10:39.339
That was the real
mission, Freeman.

1:10:39.372 --> 1:10:40.742
You knew what we
were up against,

1:10:40.775 --> 1:10:42.009
and you didn't say a thing?

1:10:42.043 --> 1:10:43.611
I couldn't jeopardize

1:10:43.644 --> 1:10:44.679
- the mission.
- Most of the squad

1:10:44.712 --> 1:10:45.947
is dead now because of you.

1:10:45.980 --> 1:10:47.849
Hey, you need to calm down...

1:10:49.784 --> 1:10:50.818
Hey, calm down.

1:10:57.058 --> 1:10:58.458
Freeman, stop.

1:11:19.346 --> 1:11:20.848
Easy, huh?

1:11:23.851 --> 1:11:24.886
We good?

1:11:33.928 --> 1:11:35.797
What the hell is that?

1:11:40.367 --> 1:11:41.636
Wait.

1:12:06.694 --> 1:12:10.798
They've been harvesting
warriors for centuries.

1:12:34.589 --> 1:12:36.524
Tree of life.

1:12:55.810 --> 1:12:57.377
Warrior's blood.

1:12:59.881 --> 1:13:01.749
This is it, Freeman.

1:13:01.782 --> 1:13:05.519
The tree of life the Fuhrer's
fantasized about for years.

1:13:09.790 --> 1:13:11.125
Don't touch her.

1:13:13.227 --> 1:13:15.796
Hey, Rucker, you put down
that gun there, buddy,

1:13:15.830 --> 1:13:18.699
and I promise I'll get
us all out of here.

1:13:25.206 --> 1:13:27.141
Jesus.

1:13:27.174 --> 1:13:29.010
Only one problem
with that, Walsh.

1:13:36.717 --> 1:13:37.952
I like it here.

1:13:40.922 --> 1:13:44.525
She'll be back for me soon.

1:13:47.929 --> 1:13:50.197
Look what she did to you.

1:13:51.532 --> 1:13:52.700
The tree.

1:13:54.068 --> 1:13:56.203
It's gonna heal me.

1:13:56.237 --> 1:13:57.738
They promised me that.

1:14:00.141 --> 1:14:01.441
No.

1:14:03.644 --> 1:14:07.982
Rucker, they're lying to you.

1:14:08.015 --> 1:14:13.054
They're just gonna feed you to
the tree like all the others.

1:14:50.691 --> 1:14:52.727
Walsh, get up.

1:15:23.024 --> 1:15:25.593
Walsh, tags, look.

1:15:51.886 --> 1:15:53.754
- Walsh.
- Yeah.

1:16:38.232 --> 1:16:40.868
Prepare the others.

1:16:54.782 --> 1:16:56.951
You're up first, Freeman.

1:17:40.461 --> 1:17:42.730
You knew we were
never going home.

1:17:51.939 --> 1:17:53.340
God.

1:17:58.312 --> 1:17:59.346
Let's do this.

1:18:20.334 --> 1:18:22.369
Get up, son.

1:18:26.874 --> 1:18:29.310
I was supposed to meet you
at the extraction point.

1:18:29.343 --> 1:18:31.078
Where are the others?

1:18:31.111 --> 1:18:32.079
They're all dead.

1:18:35.517 --> 1:18:38.819
Collect the flowers,
let's get out of here.

1:20:36.437 --> 1:20:38.640
Huh, mustard gas.

1:20:38.673 --> 1:20:42.409
Killed 120,000 people
in World War One,

1:20:42.443 --> 1:20:43.545
before it was banned.

1:20:45.145 --> 1:20:47.515
Think it'll still work?

1:20:47.549 --> 1:20:50.150
Well, I imagine we're
gonna find out soon.

1:24:44.484 --> 1:24:47.321
Major, I'm gonna
get you out of here.

1:24:47.354 --> 1:24:49.524
Torch the bitch, torch it.

1:24:49.557 --> 1:24:50.692
Just torch it.
