WEBVTT

00:01.440 --> 00:03.032
<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:03.120 --> 00:05.270
If you are gonna help me
with Haley's record

00:05.360 --> 00:07.430
well, you could maybe
move into the house with me.

00:07.520 --> 00:09.988
- It's a business arrangement.
- Of course.

00:10.080 --> 00:12.753
With me tonight is
my new color announcer, Gigi Silveri.

00:12.840 --> 00:14.512
You really expect us
to practice in this dump?

00:14.600 --> 00:16.033
Not only practice.

00:16.120 --> 00:19.795
Till further notice,
you're gonna play all your games in here.

00:20.800 --> 00:23.678
If you tell Whitey I have a heart condition,
I'm off the team.

00:23.760 --> 00:26.911
Yeah. And if I don't tell Whitey about
your heart condition, you're off the planet.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.149
<i>It was you, wasn't it?</i>

00:28.240 --> 00:31.550
The dress I designed. The one you made.
It got me into Rogue Vogue.

00:31.640 --> 00:34.518
Your clothes are good,
but if you're afraid to go...

00:34.600 --> 00:37.239
Oh, no, I'm gonna go, and I'm gonna win.

00:37.600 --> 00:40.512
Did you think about it?
Having a baby to stay together?

00:40.600 --> 00:42.113
Let me see the pills.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.071
I cannot believe you still don't believe me.

00:44.600 --> 00:45.715
Here.

00:46.600 --> 00:49.194
- Take them. I don't need them anymore.
- Haley.

00:49.360 --> 00:51.999
Your future as a basketball player
is totally secure.

00:52.080 --> 00:54.389
Your future as my husband, not so much.

00:55.120 --> 00:58.078
You know, I thought about you
every day I was gone,

00:58.160 --> 01:00.833
and you're even prettier
than I remembered.

01:00.920 --> 01:03.150
Keith Scott?
Put your hands behind your head.

01:03.240 --> 01:04.309
What the hell is this?

01:04.400 --> 01:06.994
You're under arrest for
the attempted murder of Dan Scott.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074
Learn the unknown words of this movie
--->   Skeebdo.com

01:49.440 --> 01:51.317
You're next. Haley?

01:52.560 --> 01:53.709
You're next.

01:59.640 --> 02:02.313
So have you given any thought
to which college you'd like to attend?

02:02.400 --> 02:04.994
Yeah, actually.
I've been looking at Stanford.

02:07.960 --> 02:09.187
Oh, you're serious?

02:09.280 --> 02:12.511
Well, Stanford may not be
too realistic for you, Faily.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.152
- Haley.
- What?

02:15.240 --> 02:17.754
I think you just called me "Faily."
My name's Haley.

02:17.840 --> 02:20.195
My mistake.
I must have thought that was your name

02:20.280 --> 02:21.679
because you failed every class.

02:21.760 --> 02:24.797
- I didn't fail anything.
- No? What about your marriage?

02:25.320 --> 02:27.959
Well, that is none of your business.

02:28.040 --> 02:30.952
Then there was the HCM test.
You failed that, too.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.112
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, that's right.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.668
You failed the friendship test
by letting Lucas play basketball

02:35.760 --> 02:38.320
with a serious heart condition.
Such a shame.

02:43.600 --> 02:44.794
Clear!

02:47.520 --> 02:49.192
He's eighty-sixed, yo.

02:50.440 --> 02:52.271
Just say, "He's dead," Tim.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.074
You're next.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.598
Haley? Haley.

03:03.360 --> 03:04.634
You're next.

03:06.840 --> 03:09.752
So have you given any thought
to which college you'd like to attend?

03:11.160 --> 03:12.718
Stanford.

03:14.640 --> 03:16.551
That's a great school for you.

03:17.760 --> 03:18.954
Are you okay?

03:19.240 --> 03:20.753
'Cause you seem a little sketchy.

03:20.840 --> 03:23.559
Me? No, no. Actually, I'm fine.

03:23.640 --> 03:25.790
I just love sleeping in jail cells.

03:27.280 --> 03:29.555
You understand that we have you on tape

03:30.280 --> 03:32.953
buying a bottle of liquor
the day of the fire.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.474
I've seen it. It was stimulating.

03:36.600 --> 03:37.715
Yeah.

03:38.040 --> 03:41.919
- We also know that you bought a gun.
- Oh, my God. Was Dan shot?

03:42.760 --> 03:45.991
Or wait. No, no, no. It was a fire. Yeah.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.714
It's gonna be fine.
You need to get to school.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.199
I'll call you if I hear something.

04:01.280 --> 04:03.077
Come on, Mom. It's Keith.
This is important.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.037
Your future is important.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.435
Don't you have a meeting
with your guidance counselor today

04:07.520 --> 04:08.669
to talk about colleges?

04:08.760 --> 04:10.113
You wouldn't want to miss that.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.634
I mean, look, Keith didn't go to college,
and look where he ended up.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.871
What the hell is wrong with you?
He's your brother, for God's sake.

04:15.960 --> 04:19.190
Exactly. Someone should have told him
that before he tried to light me on fire.

04:19.279 --> 04:20.269
Keith had nothing to do with that.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.476
How would you know? Were you there?

04:22.880 --> 04:24.791
Lucas, go to school.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.117
- Don't waste your breath on him.
- You wasted more than that.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.394
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Now, come on.

04:29.480 --> 04:31.198
You don't want to get hurt
before the big game tomorrow.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.508
There's gonna be scouts there.

04:32.600 --> 04:35.194
Oh, but then they're there
to see Nathan, not you.

04:36.040 --> 04:38.873
Well, got to run.
Don't want to be late for the Keith Show.

04:38.960 --> 04:41.554
In today's episode, Keith Scott learns:

04:41.640 --> 04:44.438
You play with fire,
you're gonna get burned.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.797
Sorry. Why am I here again?

04:47.880 --> 04:50.599
I mean, not that I'm not grateful
for the "Get Out Of Jail Free" card,

04:50.680 --> 04:52.238
but what's the catch?

04:52.320 --> 04:54.629
You're here so I can help you decide
which college is best for you.

04:54.720 --> 04:58.269
I doubt I'll even go to college,
so you're wasting your breath.

04:58.360 --> 05:00.351
And you're wasting my time.

05:01.040 --> 05:03.998
Why do you think your brother
would accuse you of trying to kill him?

05:04.080 --> 05:07.072
Maybe he's still mad at me
for sleeping with his wife.

05:07.160 --> 05:09.116
And is your wife gonna factor
into the college you pick?

05:09.200 --> 05:11.509
That's not really your business, is it?

05:11.640 --> 05:13.596
Anyway, colleges come to me.
I don't go to them.

05:13.680 --> 05:16.353
- Then why'd you come back to Tree Hill?
- 'Cause I live here.

05:16.440 --> 05:19.034
- And do you want to stay close to home?
- Probably.

05:19.120 --> 05:21.554
I mean, I can't really afford
to go to college out of state.

05:21.640 --> 05:23.915
Well, you're not going anywhere
until we sort this out.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.514
Okay, okay. Just stop, all right?

05:27.200 --> 05:28.872
I want to talk to my brother.

05:28.960 --> 05:32.157
I know he's out there. Come on, Danny!
Come on in!

05:32.640 --> 05:33.789
Danny!

05:37.720 --> 05:39.233
You ready to confess?

05:40.480 --> 05:42.596
Yeah, okay. Okay.

05:43.280 --> 05:44.599
I confess.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.110
I bought a bottle of liquor.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.638
I was just so thirsty.

05:49.840 --> 05:51.956
I'm sorry, Dan. Can you forgive me?

05:52.080 --> 05:53.832
You think this is funny?

05:55.320 --> 05:57.993
- Stop smiling, you son of a bitch!
- Okay.

05:58.080 --> 05:59.672
There's no need
to bring Mom into this, Danny.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.832
- Okay, that's enough.
- Wipe that damn smile off your face.

06:02.920 --> 06:04.399
That's enough, I said. That's enough.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.153
Help. Police.

06:14.840 --> 06:17.912
Well, I guess I just don't really get
the point of college.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.912
The point is to find something you love
and hopefully make a career of it.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.797
What makes you happy?

06:23.480 --> 06:25.710
I don't know. Music, I guess.

06:25.840 --> 06:28.957
But everyone loves your stuff.
You know that, right?

06:30.120 --> 06:33.157
I just think this would be
a great opportunity for you.

06:34.840 --> 06:37.229
Okay. We'll talk later, then.

06:38.440 --> 06:42.149
- Musicians can be so neurotic.
- No, that was Brooke.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.708
She's got this fashion show thing
coming up,

06:44.800 --> 06:47.473
so she calls me every second
she has a new idea

06:47.560 --> 06:49.630
which is pretty much every second.

06:49.840 --> 06:52.149
I didn't think I'd hear from her again
now that her and Lucas

06:52.240 --> 06:54.674
have stopped
this whole non-exclusive crap.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.837
Non-exclusive, meaning?

06:57.640 --> 07:00.029
Basically, friends with benefits.

07:02.040 --> 07:03.553
Friends with benefits?

07:04.440 --> 07:05.953
Isn't that just sleeping around?

07:06.040 --> 07:10.113
No. It's like being friends with someone
you get to have sex with,

07:10.200 --> 07:13.158
but you can still hook up
with other people, too.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.432
Okay. So you're right.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.028
It's the same.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.073
And what about you?

07:24.480 --> 07:27.552
- Do you have any beneficial friends?
- No.

07:27.920 --> 07:29.876
I dated this guy Nathan for a while,

07:29.960 --> 07:32.599
but we were more benefits
than we were friends.

07:33.400 --> 07:36.551
But we're just friends, no benefits now.
And then...

07:37.320 --> 07:40.517
There was this other guy,
but he was more than that.

07:47.240 --> 07:48.958
Were you in love with him?

07:53.280 --> 07:56.078
That's the hard part. Sex is easy.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.918
But if you find someone you're in love with
who's also your friend,

08:00.000 --> 08:02.275
wouldn't that be the greatest benefit?

08:02.520 --> 08:04.715
That's the fairy tale, I guess.

08:04.800 --> 08:07.109
There's nothing wrong with fairy tales.

08:07.800 --> 08:10.030
Everyone ends up happily ever after.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.595
When I was little,
my parents took us to California

08:16.680 --> 08:19.672
so my sister could look at colleges,
and Stanford was just one of our stops,

08:19.760 --> 08:22.797
and I was only eight, but I just fell in love.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.395
I'd never seen anything like it
growing up in Tree Hill,

08:26.480 --> 08:30.268
all those different people in one place,
and I just thought to myself,

08:30.640 --> 08:33.234
"This must be what the world is like.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.551
"This is where I want to be."

08:35.640 --> 08:38.438
And ever since then,
I've just wanted to go there.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.076
Where does your husband want to go?

08:43.000 --> 08:45.355
Hey, this came to the apartment for you.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.232
Guess they think you still live there.

08:47.680 --> 08:48.749
Thanks.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.951
2,798 miles.

08:51.640 --> 08:53.710
That's how far apart
our dream schools are.

08:53.800 --> 08:54.915
Yeah.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.350
Nathan, I said some things
the other night...

08:58.440 --> 09:00.032
I said some things, too.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.233
I'm sorry.

09:03.800 --> 09:04.994
Me, too.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.470
I guess we can add this to the list
of things we should have talked about.

09:10.560 --> 09:12.232
We can talk about it now.

09:12.520 --> 09:15.671
I didn't realize I was supposed to
figure out my entire future today.

09:15.760 --> 09:17.591
You should at least be thinking about it.

09:17.680 --> 09:21.753
Trust me, I've been thinking about it
ever since I could shoot a basketball.

09:22.720 --> 09:25.678
Look, Mayor Scott, the arrest was a favor,

09:26.080 --> 09:28.640
but without anything solid,
I can't hold him.

09:28.720 --> 09:31.188
In fact, the only charges I could bring
would be against you

09:31.280 --> 09:33.111
for assaulting your brother.

09:33.760 --> 09:35.273
Can I fire you?

09:35.800 --> 09:36.869
No.

09:37.680 --> 09:39.511
<i>It's good seeing you, Danny.</i>

09:41.080 --> 09:44.117
<i>Could this visit take the place</i>
<i>of Christmas this year?</i>

09:54.640 --> 09:56.676
Stanford is, like, my dream school.

09:56.760 --> 09:59.354
It's where I've wanted to go
since I played pretend SATs.

09:59.440 --> 10:00.953
Man, I forgot
how much of a nerd you were.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.553
Whatever, Rambo.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.351
Now, Rambo was cool!

10:07.120 --> 10:11.636
I don't feel like I'm picking a college
as much as I feel like I'm picking a future.

10:11.720 --> 10:14.518
Yeah, but didn't you kind of pick a future
when you married Nathan?

10:14.600 --> 10:16.238
Watch it, mister.

10:17.520 --> 10:20.717
Hey, by the way, you're, like,
feeling all right and everything, right?

10:20.800 --> 10:22.119
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

10:22.200 --> 10:25.510
I just had this dream
that you had a heart attack.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.079
And you're buying your medicine,

10:27.160 --> 10:29.594
and you don't need to borrow
any money or anything, right?

10:29.680 --> 10:31.875
Yes, I'm fine, but thank you.

10:32.280 --> 10:34.111
What's up, boyfriend? Faily?

10:34.200 --> 10:36.031
And I'm never telling you
anything again ever.

10:36.120 --> 10:38.634
Speaking of, though, what is the
deal with these meetings today

10:38.720 --> 10:42.872
- when college is like a million years away?
- Or 3,000 miles. Bye.

10:43.720 --> 10:44.948
Okay, I don't get it.

10:45.040 --> 10:47.270
She just realized that she and Nathan
want to go to college

10:47.360 --> 10:49.794
- across the country from each other.
- They just figured that out?

10:49.880 --> 10:52.110
Isn't that the sort of thing
couples talk about?

10:52.200 --> 10:54.430
Yes. So,

10:55.080 --> 10:56.752
what are your plans after high school?

10:56.840 --> 10:59.274
Well, I always figured
I'd marry a millionaire

10:59.360 --> 11:02.591
and he'd whisk me away
to his private island in the Bahamas.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.511
Where are you on that, anyway?

11:04.600 --> 11:07.512
How's the fashion institute's
basketball team?

11:07.600 --> 11:11.115
Is there a good fashion program
at, like, basketball school?

11:15.760 --> 11:18.399
Mouth, you're totally screwed.

11:19.160 --> 11:21.230
Principal Turner wants to see you.

11:23.440 --> 11:26.432
I don't think I did anything wrong.
I mean, did he say what he wants?

11:26.520 --> 11:30.149
No, because he didn't actually send me.
I just need your help.

11:30.240 --> 11:33.198
But I had an appointment
with the guidance counselor.

11:33.320 --> 11:35.595
Why would you let some burnout
in a dead-end job

11:35.680 --> 11:36.715
tell you where to go to college?

11:36.800 --> 11:38.313
I mean, college obviously
didn't work for her.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.630
Rachel, that burnout's my mom.

11:42.400 --> 11:45.153
See? I can joke, too.
But seriously, I need to get back.

11:45.240 --> 11:49.313
But seriously, just catch the counselor
on her lunch hour at the soup kitchen.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.789
- I need your help.
- Marvin McFadden?

11:57.480 --> 11:58.629
Keith.

12:03.160 --> 12:05.594
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

12:05.720 --> 12:08.075
The Tree Hill jail isn't exactly Attica.

12:08.320 --> 12:10.754
But you didn't have to wait for me.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.116
We can't let Dan get away with this.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.794
We should probably sue him
or call the news or maybe even hire...

12:16.880 --> 12:18.074
Go out?

12:19.080 --> 12:20.957
The Ravens are playing tomorrow night,

12:21.040 --> 12:23.952
and I was thinking that
maybe we should go together.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.436
You're asking me out on a date?

12:27.160 --> 12:29.720
Keith, Dan is trying
to convict you of murder.

12:30.080 --> 12:33.516
I didn't kill anyone.
Dan is just trying to rattle me.

12:34.400 --> 12:38.075
Besides, nothing would make
me happier than taking you out.

12:39.160 --> 12:42.277
And nothing would make Dan angrier
than seeing me happy.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.312
Well, okay, then. I'd love to.

12:44.400 --> 12:47.631
But, for the record,
I'll be doing it for the first reason.

12:47.960 --> 12:49.075
Okay.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.149
The second reason will just be a bonus.

12:53.960 --> 12:55.791
So you're interested in fashion design?

12:55.880 --> 12:58.713
Yes, but I'm interested in a lot of things.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.553
- Such as?
- I'm student council president,

13:01.920 --> 13:04.957
captain of the cheerleaders,
founder of DWnotl,

13:05.040 --> 13:07.600
and girlfriend of Ravens' star
shooting guard, Lucas Scott.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.148
And what are your plans after high school?

13:10.320 --> 13:12.754
After high school, I have cheer practice.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.752
Five, six, seven, eight.

13:16.840 --> 13:20.276
Cross front, cross back,
turn around, and pop!

13:20.360 --> 13:23.352
- Back it up.
- Whoa! Stop! Halt! Cut!

13:23.440 --> 13:25.351
Why is everybody here early?

13:25.440 --> 13:28.273
- Early? You're like an hour late.
- I don't think so.

13:28.360 --> 13:30.828
Unlike you, I've never thought
there was a 13:00.

13:30.920 --> 13:33.275
Brooke, Rachel said
you wanted us here an hour early.

13:33.360 --> 13:36.318
And where did you two
think I was this whole time?

13:36.640 --> 13:38.039
Late, as usual.

13:38.120 --> 13:41.271
Brooke, the Classic's coming up,
and we don't have a routine yet.

13:41.360 --> 13:44.477
And I figured
since Mouth helped you out last year,

13:44.560 --> 13:46.596
we could maybe come up with one
and surprise you.

13:46.680 --> 13:48.159
So surprise.

13:48.560 --> 13:52.269
The only way I'd be surprised right now
is if you were actually wearing underwear.

13:52.360 --> 13:54.396
I guess no surprises, then.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.111
Okay. I am the captain of this squad.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.634
It is my job to come up with
a routine for the tournament.

13:59.720 --> 14:02.632
But the tournament's the same
weekend as Rogue Vogue.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.392
You'll be in New York City.

14:06.560 --> 14:09.120
That's why you submitted
my fashion designs.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.109
Surprise.

14:22.440 --> 14:26.115
I mean, I could probably get
some academic scholarship interest,

14:27.560 --> 14:29.869
but I'm really hoping
to still play basketball.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.876
<i>I guess I'm not ready to give it up.</i>

14:33.960 --> 14:37.839
You know, in jail a shot like that
would make you somebody's girlfriend.

14:38.200 --> 14:39.838
Yeah, well, you'd know.

14:40.360 --> 14:42.828
- I was worried about you. Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

14:42.920 --> 14:45.150
Anyway, you're a kid, Lucas.
You should worry about kid stuff.

14:45.240 --> 14:48.755
Oh, you mean like school, money, Mom,

14:49.280 --> 14:51.430
college scholarships, scouts?

14:51.520 --> 14:53.909
Wow, it's tough being a kid these days.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.590
Since when do you worry about scouts?

14:56.680 --> 14:59.114
Since I realized if I get
a basketball scholarship,

14:59.200 --> 15:00.679
my mom won't have to worry.

15:00.760 --> 15:03.672
- She likes to worry about you.
- I don't want her to.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.236
You know, college is expensive.

15:06.720 --> 15:08.915
We'll manage. We always have.

15:11.320 --> 15:13.151
- What?
- You said "we."

15:16.960 --> 15:20.157
I asked your mom out on a date.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.839
- I hope that's okay with you.
- I think it's great.

15:23.920 --> 15:26.309
- What did she say?
- Funny.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.115
I guess you had to ask the question.

15:29.200 --> 15:32.556
My track record with your mom
is about as bad as the Ravens'.

15:32.800 --> 15:35.473
So do me a favor. Win tomorrow night.

15:35.560 --> 15:38.233
I was gonna say "score,"
but I didn't think that was appropriate.

15:44.960 --> 15:47.190
Oh, hi. Come on in.
Have you seen my friend Mouth?

15:47.280 --> 15:49.430
He looks just like you, only he
has a skank attached to his hip.

15:49.520 --> 15:52.751
I'm sorry, Brooke. I was trying to help
all the cheerleaders, including you.

15:52.840 --> 15:55.752
Well, for the record, when you're
helping Rachel, you are not helping me.

15:55.840 --> 15:57.592
I don't think she tried to set you up.

15:57.680 --> 15:59.955
She said she had no idea
it was the same weekend

16:00.040 --> 16:02.315
- when she submitted your designs.
- And you believed her?

16:02.400 --> 16:04.231
Mouth, she is lying, okay?

16:04.320 --> 16:06.151
If you weren't so busy
trying to see through her shirt,

16:06.240 --> 16:08.595
you would see through her BS.
She's using you.

16:08.680 --> 16:11.752
- How?
- I don't know. I am not a conniving bitch.

16:11.840 --> 16:15.355
But I know that if she's being nice to you,
it is for a reason, and not a good one.

16:15.440 --> 16:18.512
And if you want a new friend, why don't
you hang out with the raisin girl?

16:18.600 --> 16:22.275
- Her name is Gigi.
- Yes, Gigi, good. Rachel, bad.

16:23.720 --> 16:26.712
- So I should stick with my own kind.
- I'm not saying that.

16:26.800 --> 16:30.270
I just know how someone like her
sees someone like you.

16:30.960 --> 16:32.279
Someone like me?

16:33.960 --> 16:37.350
I get it. A hot girl would never
hang out with someone like me

16:37.440 --> 16:39.431
- unless she wanted something.
- No, Mouth, wait...

16:39.520 --> 16:42.080
Why? Do you have more furniture
for me to move?

16:43.760 --> 16:45.193
<i>Your parents aren't around?</i>

16:45.280 --> 16:47.794
No, but that's not unusual for Tree Hill.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.878
We should have milk cartons
with missing parents on them.

16:50.960 --> 16:53.758
- It must be difficult being alone.
- I'm not alone.

16:54.200 --> 16:55.553
I hate being alone.

16:55.640 --> 16:59.918
I have my roommate and my squad,
my friends, my Peyton, my Lucas.

17:00.240 --> 17:04.358
Hey, I didn't know what to get you,
so I got a little bit of everything.

17:05.359 --> 17:08.238
Is there a kick in the head in there?
'Cause that's what I deserve.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.513
What's wrong?

17:11.520 --> 17:14.796
Mouth came over here earlier,
and I went all "mean girls" on him.

17:14.880 --> 17:17.155
Wait a second. You were mean to Mouth?

17:17.480 --> 17:19.914
Yeah, you know what? There might be
a kick in the head here somewhere.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.912
It's just he's gotten all buddy-buddy
with that escort wannabe Rachel

17:23.000 --> 17:24.398
who I found out
only entered me in Rogue Vogue

17:24.480 --> 17:26.277
because it's the same weekend
as the Classic.

17:26.359 --> 17:29.636
- So do them both.
- I can't. I need you to help me decide.

17:29.720 --> 17:32.234
I mean, this is my last year to take
my squad to the Classic and win,

17:32.320 --> 17:35.357
but Rogue Vogue could be
my only chance at showing my designs.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.715
You know what I would do if I was you?

17:38.320 --> 17:40.470
- Do them both.
- You are not helping.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.312
Okay, they're in different states,

17:42.400 --> 17:44.391
but, I mean, they're during
different times of the weekend.

17:44.480 --> 17:47.040
And I would still have to
be in two places at once.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.997
I'm not Supergirl. I can't...

17:50.320 --> 17:51.719
I could fly.

17:52.760 --> 17:54.398
Oh, my God. This could totally work.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.357
I could win two trophies
and keep one on my dresser,

17:56.440 --> 17:58.032
and shove the other one up Rachel's...

18:02.040 --> 18:03.519
Hello, Peyton.

18:03.960 --> 18:05.598
Oops. I mean Haley.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.991
It's hard to keep
all of Nathan's girlfriends straight.

18:08.080 --> 18:10.674
You know, I'll probably call
the next one you.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.354
- So what are you doing here?
- Just some official mayor business.

18:13.440 --> 18:16.159
- Wouldn't want to bore you.
- Thanks.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.670
How's my new song doing, anyway?

18:20.200 --> 18:22.589
- What are you talking about?
- The song you're recording.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.432
Nathan's paying Chris Keller
to work with you,

18:24.520 --> 18:27.398
and since I'm paying Nathan's allowance
for being such a good little boy,

18:27.480 --> 18:28.959
it's kind of mine.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.270
You didn't know where
the money was coming from.

18:33.360 --> 18:35.351
Don't you and Nathan talk about anything?

18:35.440 --> 18:38.512
Yeah, mostly we talk about
how happy he is to be away from you.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.591
You know, that's not exactly
the "thank you" I was expecting

18:40.680 --> 18:43.319
after dropping thousands
of dollars on your career.

18:44.400 --> 18:45.958
I'll see you in class.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.079
Nathan,

18:51.280 --> 18:53.840
did you pay Chris
to help me with my music?

18:53.920 --> 18:57.151
- Good morning to you, too.
- I just ran into your dad. Is that true?

18:57.240 --> 18:59.879
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you tell me, Nathan?

18:59.960 --> 19:01.791
I want us to be honest
with each other about everything.

19:01.880 --> 19:04.155
So, what? Every time I want
to do something nice for you

19:04.240 --> 19:06.037
- I have to ask first?
- No, that's not the point.

19:06.120 --> 19:08.395
It was very nice, but you, like,
totally went behind my back

19:08.480 --> 19:10.471
and it felt like something Dan would do.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.438
Do I have to change the locks
at school now?

19:18.520 --> 19:20.317
I'm the Mayor. I have the keys to the city.

19:20.400 --> 19:23.119
Besides, is that any way
to talk to your new teacher?

19:23.200 --> 19:26.033
Principal Turner asked me
to speak to your Political Science class.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.394
You're kidding.

19:27.480 --> 19:30.711
I need to get away from my dad,
and basketball's the way out.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.633
The plan's always been
high school and then Duke,

19:33.720 --> 19:36.314
- then the NBA.
- Who came up with this plan?

19:39.240 --> 19:40.389
My dad.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.232
Where are you going?
Are you just gonna skip class?

19:42.320 --> 19:44.754
I've heard you speak, Dad. Waste of time.

19:58.720 --> 20:00.631
Have you talked to your parents
about college?

20:00.720 --> 20:04.599
Well, I mean, my birth mom's really
the only one that's around right now

20:05.040 --> 20:06.393
and she didn't go.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.153
What did she do after high school?

20:08.360 --> 20:09.588
Drugs.

20:10.440 --> 20:12.874
Well, you didn't go to college,
and you're doing just fine.

20:12.960 --> 20:16.396
I'm a freelance writer
who lives paycheck to paycheck.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.758
I've done okay,
but I could have done better.

20:21.320 --> 20:24.790
- You don't want to go to college?
- Does that surprise you?

20:24.880 --> 20:27.678
Actually, it does.
I'd just assumed you'd go.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.432
- Why?
- Because you can.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.356
I never understood people who had
the chance to go and chose not to.

20:35.440 --> 20:39.353
Well, I don't understand people
that waste four years in school

20:39.440 --> 20:41.158
when they could be out living life.

20:41.920 --> 20:44.912
What's the hurry?
From what I hear, college is fun.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.515
I can see you majoring in Art
or Music or Business.

20:48.600 --> 20:52.593
Really? You see all that without
tarot cards or a Ouija board?

20:53.200 --> 20:56.715
- What else do you see?
- I see you being late for cheerleading.

20:58.480 --> 21:00.391
I guess you really are psychic.

21:00.840 --> 21:02.796
All right. Well, how about this?

21:02.880 --> 21:05.917
Do you by any chance
see a name for this album?

21:06.320 --> 21:08.629
Hopefully something better
than "This Album."

21:08.720 --> 21:11.109
I don't know. It's kind of growing on me.

21:12.960 --> 21:14.473
Okay. Have fun.

21:14.720 --> 21:17.712
Don't benefit any friends,
and do good cheering.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.153
Go, Ravens.

21:20.640 --> 21:22.358
You know, I'm starting
to doubt my powers,

21:22.440 --> 21:25.352
'cause I never would have
seen you as a cheerleader.

21:25.840 --> 21:27.831
My mom was a cheerleader.

21:28.480 --> 21:32.359
I just want my mom
to stop worrying and enjoy life.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.518
She deserves that much.

21:38.440 --> 21:41.000
So tonight's the big night.
Are you excited?

21:41.360 --> 21:44.352
I mean, Keith is, like,
the most popular kid in school.

21:44.440 --> 21:47.079
Don't make fun of me. I'm too nervous.

21:51.720 --> 21:53.392
All right. Now,

21:54.760 --> 21:56.079
how do I look?

21:56.640 --> 21:58.870
- Like my mom.
- I'm serious.

21:59.680 --> 22:01.113
You look great, Ma.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.630
You looked great the last time
you asked me and the time before that.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.995
And what about the time before that?

22:07.880 --> 22:08.949
So-so.

22:10.640 --> 22:12.790
Shouldn't dating get easier?

22:14.720 --> 22:15.789
Okay.

22:15.880 --> 22:17.359
Do you want me to have
a little talk with him,

22:17.440 --> 22:20.193
you know, make sure
his intentions are honorable?

22:20.360 --> 22:21.793
I got it from here.

22:23.280 --> 22:26.033
All right. Good luck at the game.

22:26.320 --> 22:28.117
You will be joining us
for dinner afterwards?

22:28.200 --> 22:29.918
- I'll be there.
- Okay.

22:30.080 --> 22:33.470
You know, this is getting pretty serious
bringing him home to meet the fam?

22:33.560 --> 22:34.754
Enough!

22:42.800 --> 22:44.518
Keith, you look...

22:45.240 --> 22:47.800
You look... too.

22:53.280 --> 22:57.751
I have a confession.
I was pretty nervous about tonight.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.194
Oh, yeah. Me, too.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.438
I actually changed my shirt three times.

23:01.920 --> 23:05.071
I was gonna change again,
and I realized I only have three shirts.

23:05.160 --> 23:07.116
- Well, I like that one.
- Thanks.

23:07.680 --> 23:08.874
This is yours?

23:09.120 --> 23:11.236
This is the car I've always dreamed about

23:11.320 --> 23:13.470
which makes it perfect for tonight.

23:14.640 --> 23:16.710
What made you finally decide to buy it?

23:16.800 --> 23:19.917
Lately I've been less about
talking and more about doing.

23:28.880 --> 23:31.440
<i>So why don't you like to</i>
<i>talk about college?</i>

23:31.840 --> 23:34.832
'Cause it freaks me out, okay?

23:35.720 --> 23:37.153
I like high school.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.072
I'm good at high school.

23:39.160 --> 23:42.232
You know, I know who my friends are
and who my enemy is.

23:42.760 --> 23:44.751
I've got this place down.

23:47.040 --> 23:48.234
Rachel.

23:48.520 --> 23:51.512
Question. What do Rogue Vogue
and the Classic have in common?

23:51.600 --> 23:54.637
Answer? Brooke Davis.
Nice try, but I'm doing both.

23:54.720 --> 23:56.597
- How are you gonna do that?
- It's called "you're an idiot."

23:56.680 --> 24:00.275
One's on Saturday, one's on Sunday and
there's a flight smack-dab in the middle.

24:00.360 --> 24:03.670
So you're gonna have to try harder
next time you practice bitchcraft.

24:03.760 --> 24:07.070
Won't you just be
the busiest girl in ho business?

24:07.160 --> 24:10.709
And you'll be taking a backseat,
but I guess you're used to that.

24:28.360 --> 24:32.433
- This gym's nearly as old as you are.
- Yeah, but I look better.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.394
- Hey, Whitey.
- Gonna win one for us tonight?

24:35.480 --> 24:38.233
Well, it depends.
Are you gonna stick around and watch?

24:38.320 --> 24:40.993
- Yeah, I'll be here.
- I bet you will.

24:43.960 --> 24:45.837
Good to have you home, Keith.

24:46.240 --> 24:49.915
All I need now is a win
to make this night perfect.

24:53.520 --> 24:56.034
Your basketball career
could end just like that.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.395
You need to think about
your education, too.

24:58.480 --> 24:59.674
You don't get it.

24:59.760 --> 25:02.752
Without basketball,
I'm not gonna have an education.

25:02.840 --> 25:05.149
I'm not gonna get into college
based on my grades.

25:05.240 --> 25:06.798
Basketball's all I've got.

25:12.240 --> 25:16.358
This place is disgusting.
I can actually see the germs in the air.

25:19.080 --> 25:20.593
Yeah, me, too.

25:22.600 --> 25:26.149
- Nathan, good news.
- What, I'm adopted?

25:26.360 --> 25:28.316
- David Shea is here.
- What?

25:29.480 --> 25:31.277
If you want to play
for any basketball powerhouse

25:31.360 --> 25:34.113
on the East Coast,
that's the scout you want to impress.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.397
Seems all those phone calls
I made on your behalf paid off.

25:37.480 --> 25:41.029
This has nothing to do with you.
If he's here, it's because of me.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.758
You can't own this one.

25:43.640 --> 25:45.676
All right, let's bring it in! Come on!
Move it!

25:45.760 --> 25:47.239
Move, move, move!

25:47.320 --> 25:48.548
This is Gigi Silveri.

25:48.640 --> 25:51.791
Now that the Ravens
have stripped out of their street clothes

25:51.880 --> 25:55.793
and put on tight shorts
that caress their firm buttocks,

25:56.240 --> 25:58.435
we're ready to get under way. Mouth?

25:59.120 --> 26:00.792
That was good.

26:00.880 --> 26:03.075
All right, here's the deal.
You want to go back

26:03.160 --> 26:06.470
to playing in a gym that doesn't
smell like moldy cheese?

26:06.560 --> 26:09.711
Well, go out there
and win a game for a change!

26:10.160 --> 26:12.674
All right, on three. One, two, three!

26:12.760 --> 26:13.749
Win!

26:14.360 --> 26:16.669
Nathan! Not tonight.

26:17.440 --> 26:20.079
- You have a seat.
- What? Why?

26:20.160 --> 26:22.993
I understand you skipped
Political Science this morning.

26:23.080 --> 26:25.036
Coach, my dad was there.
He knew I was skipping.

26:25.120 --> 26:27.315
I didn't. You know the policy.

26:27.680 --> 26:30.399
You miss school, you miss the game.
No exceptions.

26:30.480 --> 26:32.675
- Dustin, you're in.
- No, no, Coach.

26:32.760 --> 26:34.557
There's a big-time scout here.
I have to play tonight.

26:34.640 --> 26:37.950
Nathan, sit down. Now!

26:55.520 --> 26:57.670
What if basketball doesn't work out?

26:59.000 --> 27:00.877
I don't expect it to.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.315
But if it can help me
get into a good college,

27:03.400 --> 27:07.188
and help my mom out at the same time,
I'm gonna throw everything I have into it.

27:07.280 --> 27:09.430
Defense! Defense!

27:10.400 --> 27:12.675
Defense! Defense!

27:18.600 --> 27:19.589
Oh, yeah!

27:29.880 --> 27:31.677
Piece of advice for you, gramps,

27:31.760 --> 27:35.958
most coaches play their leading scorers.
It kind of helps them, you know, win.

27:36.680 --> 27:39.592
The Mayor's talking to me. What an honor.

27:51.400 --> 27:52.992
And there's the end of the first half.

27:53.080 --> 27:55.548
The Ravens trail in a close one, 37-34.

27:55.640 --> 27:58.393
We'll be back in a few minutes
with the start of the second half.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.593
I'll be right back.

28:11.280 --> 28:12.508
Can I talk to you, Coach?

28:12.600 --> 28:14.750
Not if it's about your brother,
Ferris Bueller.

28:14.840 --> 28:16.990
Look, the only reason
Nathan skipped class was because of Dan,

28:17.080 --> 28:20.038
and the only way to get him away
from Dan is to let the scouts see him play.

28:20.120 --> 28:21.633
It's not your place to defend him.

28:21.720 --> 28:23.870
Yes, it is.
You made me co-captain, didn't you?

28:23.960 --> 28:25.712
Well, he's my teammate,
and the team needs him.

28:25.800 --> 28:28.109
I appreciate your concern
for your "teammate,"

28:28.200 --> 28:29.269
but rules are rules,

28:29.360 --> 28:31.749
and you're gonna have to find
a way to win without him.

28:40.240 --> 28:43.710
- Funny running into you here.
- Am I in the right bathroom?

28:43.800 --> 28:45.836
Mouth, I'm really, really, really sorry.

28:46.480 --> 28:47.959
Okay? I didn't mean to hurt you.

28:48.040 --> 28:52.955
I just meant a guy like you
is one of my very best friends,

28:53.880 --> 28:57.793
and I was just trying to protect you
from one of my very unbest friends.

29:00.960 --> 29:02.359
It's okay, Brooke.

29:02.600 --> 29:05.751
Can I make it up to you?
Hang out after the game?

29:07.080 --> 29:09.435
I never thought
I'd be propositioned in a men's room

29:09.520 --> 29:11.954
- and like it, anyway.
- Is that a yes?

29:12.320 --> 29:14.595
Well, I kind of have plans.

29:16.160 --> 29:17.559
With Rachel.

29:18.080 --> 29:20.150
- I'd invite you, but...
- It's okay.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.718
Be careful, Mouth.

29:34.400 --> 29:35.515
David Shea.

29:35.840 --> 29:38.229
Mayor Dan Scott, Nathan's father.

29:38.320 --> 29:40.072
I was looking forward
to seeing your son play.

29:40.160 --> 29:43.038
Who wasn't? Listen, David, the truth is

29:43.120 --> 29:45.429
Coach Durham
has a personal issue with me.

29:45.520 --> 29:48.557
Unfortunately, he's punishing
Nathan for it. It's sad, really.

29:48.640 --> 29:51.791
- Lucas is playing well.
- That's even sadder.

29:51.880 --> 29:53.632
Are you talking about Lucas?

29:53.720 --> 29:56.871
'Cause I'm Keith, Lucas' uncle.

29:56.960 --> 29:58.393
He's having quite a night.

29:58.480 --> 30:01.313
Yeah. He's a really good kid,
and he's got great grades, too.

30:01.400 --> 30:04.995
That's nice to hear.
Well, I got to get back inside.

30:05.080 --> 30:07.753
- It's nice to meet you two.
- You, too.

30:12.400 --> 30:15.790
- You both could do better.
- God knows I've done worse.

30:19.680 --> 30:20.954
Keith,

30:21.600 --> 30:23.431
I wouldn't leave town if I were you.

30:24.040 --> 30:27.396
Well, I'm not going anywhere, Danny.
I wouldn't dream of it.

30:40.880 --> 30:43.633
I feel like I can't win.
I mean, do I go on without him?

30:43.720 --> 30:46.553
Do I beg him to come with me,
follow him wherever he goes?

30:47.920 --> 30:50.229
I don't think you ever realize
how much you love something

30:50.320 --> 30:51.389
until you have to give it up.

30:56.800 --> 30:58.552
What is that boy on?

30:58.640 --> 30:59.629
Or not on.

30:59.720 --> 31:02.154
<i>Okay, time winding down</i>
<i>in the fourth quarter.</i>

31:02.240 --> 31:04.629
<i>The Ravens need a basket.</i>
<i>Lucas Scott drives into the lane.</i>

31:04.720 --> 31:07.678
<i>He puts the shot up and scores,</i>
<i>and the Ravens are down by one.</i>

31:07.760 --> 31:09.239
<i>Nine seconds left in the game.</i>

31:09.320 --> 31:10.435
Move, move, move, move!

31:10.520 --> 31:13.034
All right, now, I want you guys
to take a good look around you.

31:13.120 --> 31:16.237
Take a good, hard look,
because once in a while

31:16.320 --> 31:19.198
you have to ask yourself
how you got to this place,

31:19.280 --> 31:23.831
0-2 playing in this crummy sweatbox
of a gym.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.399
Well, I'll tell you how you got there.

31:25.480 --> 31:28.278
You got there
by playing selfishly and losing.

31:28.360 --> 31:30.316
But for the next nine seconds,

31:30.400 --> 31:33.597
if you change the first thing,
you'll change the second.

31:33.680 --> 31:36.831
All right, let's go. One, two, three...

31:36.920 --> 31:38.273
Ravens!

31:41.360 --> 31:44.318
- Did your father go to Duke?
- No.

31:45.560 --> 31:46.834
But I'm better than him.

31:49.280 --> 31:50.554
Lucas.

31:53.080 --> 31:54.274
The dead spot.

31:54.720 --> 31:56.676
Fleming has no left, all right?

31:56.760 --> 31:58.671
He'll go to his right,
so if you force him to the dead spot,

31:58.760 --> 32:00.079
you'll be able to pick his pocket.

32:42.040 --> 32:43.553
<i>I never would have joined</i>
<i>the basketball team</i>

32:43.640 --> 32:44.834
<i>if it wasn't for my uncle Keith.</i>

32:45.800 --> 32:49.634
You know, he wanted me to be
a part of something, to feel like I belong.

33:05.440 --> 33:07.874
<i>It sounds like he really cares about you.</i>

33:10.000 --> 33:11.911
Yeah, he's like a father to me.

33:26.920 --> 33:28.956
You keep playing like that
and you might have a chance

33:29.040 --> 33:30.439
with the captain of the cheerleaders.

33:30.520 --> 33:33.318
- Really? She say something?
- Yeah. She said this.

33:34.960 --> 33:36.154
You coming over tonight?

33:36.240 --> 33:39.437
I don't know. I'm gonna have dinner
with Keith and my mom.

33:39.520 --> 33:40.748
So how about after that?

33:40.840 --> 33:42.558
You don't want to hang around
and be a third wheel.

33:42.640 --> 33:44.153
What if they want to get freaky?

33:44.240 --> 33:46.674
That's my mom, not a visual
I want to have in my head.

33:46.760 --> 33:50.036
So how about you come over,
and I'll give you a better one?

33:50.120 --> 33:51.439
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.513
Have fun with your family.

34:01.320 --> 34:03.231
- You okay?
- Yeah.

34:03.880 --> 34:05.871
Just worried about Lucas.

34:06.680 --> 34:10.355
I'm sorry you didn't get to play today.
I know you wanted to impress that scout.

34:10.440 --> 34:14.558
Why? You don't think he was impressed
with my bench-sitting skills?

34:18.639 --> 34:21.029
Haley, I'm sorry.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.594
I wish I had an answer
for all this school stuff.

34:23.679 --> 34:26.911
It's just... If I tell you not to go to Stanford,

34:27.000 --> 34:29.560
I'm telling you not
to follow your dreams, again.

34:30.120 --> 34:33.032
If I tell you to go, I'm saying
I don't want to be with you.

34:34.360 --> 34:36.032
So what do you want me to say?

34:37.639 --> 34:39.072
Say you love me.

34:40.239 --> 34:41.797
Of course I love you.

34:42.400 --> 34:43.799
Scott!

34:44.360 --> 34:45.679
Dave Shea.

34:46.679 --> 34:48.079
You played a great game today.

34:48.600 --> 34:50.909
Thanks. I had a lot of help.

34:53.239 --> 34:56.994
You know, you should meet
my brother, though. Hey, Nathan!

35:04.520 --> 35:07.512
- How you doing?
- All right. Good to meet you.

35:07.600 --> 35:10.273
- You, too. Good game, huh?
- Fantastic.

35:10.360 --> 35:13.432
The truth is, I don't really
like to think about college,

35:13.880 --> 35:15.632
'cause that means high school's over.

35:21.080 --> 35:24.914
<i>After graduation, everyone will</i>
<i>probably go play basketball,</i>

35:25.360 --> 35:27.510
<i>or sing or start record labels.</i>

35:29.160 --> 35:31.628
And I'll have to start all over.

35:32.280 --> 35:33.429
Alone.

35:37.320 --> 35:38.878
<i>I'm sure I'll be fine.</i>

35:42.520 --> 35:44.556
But, like I said,
I don't like to think about it.

35:54.080 --> 35:55.672
<i>At the end of the day,</i>

35:55.760 --> 35:57.557
<i>I just want to be with</i>
<i>my family and friends.</i>

35:58.120 --> 36:01.157
I want to play basketball,
and I want to go to college.

36:02.440 --> 36:04.556
Well, that's not too much to ask, is it?

36:06.560 --> 36:10.951
It's just hard because the game's
the only thing that ever mattered to me

36:11.640 --> 36:13.198
till Haley came along.

36:19.920 --> 36:21.194
Coach,

36:21.400 --> 36:23.630
I wanted to talk to you
about not playing me tonight.

36:24.680 --> 36:27.353
I'm not having this conversation again.

36:28.040 --> 36:29.917
It was the right thing to do.

36:32.080 --> 36:34.594
Well, that was a good tip
you gave to Lucas.

36:34.800 --> 36:36.631
It may have won us the game.

36:38.160 --> 36:41.516
Tonight you put the team
ahead of yourself.

36:42.280 --> 36:44.236
That's what a true leader does,

36:44.560 --> 36:47.199
and that's something
your father never learned.

36:48.040 --> 36:49.917
And don't worry about that scout.

36:50.560 --> 36:53.120
I'll see he comes back.
You'll get your shot.

36:53.560 --> 36:55.357
Thanks, Coach, but,

36:56.080 --> 36:58.992
I was hoping maybe
you could call somebody at Stanford.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.632
All right, I'll make a call.

37:08.080 --> 37:10.469
It's just hard because before I was married

37:10.560 --> 37:13.199
I thought Stanford was my future.

37:15.440 --> 37:19.149
But all those different faces I remember,
all those different people,

37:20.760 --> 37:22.398
none of them are Nathan.

37:32.360 --> 37:35.557
- Hey.
- Hi. How was the game?

37:35.680 --> 37:37.238
Yeah, it was okay.

37:37.320 --> 37:40.357
It wasn't exciting watching
the Ravens get their first win?

37:42.600 --> 37:43.794
I was there.

37:43.880 --> 37:45.950
Well, why didn't you come say hi?

37:46.920 --> 37:50.515
I just wanted to watch you do your thing.
You were great.

37:50.880 --> 37:53.519
Yeah, I can go pom-to-pom
with the cheeriest.

37:53.600 --> 37:55.079
I'm serious, Peyton.

37:55.400 --> 37:57.470
You're smart, you're funny,
you're beautiful,

37:57.560 --> 38:00.154
and what I can see,
there's nothing that you're not good at.

38:01.200 --> 38:02.428
You want something?

38:02.520 --> 38:04.476
Except taking compliments, apparently.

38:05.440 --> 38:07.078
No, I'm sorry. I just...

38:07.440 --> 38:09.271
I'm not used to it.

38:09.840 --> 38:12.798
You know, as I watched you tonight,
I thought to myself,

38:14.720 --> 38:17.553
"This girl has so much to offer the world.

38:18.440 --> 38:20.237
"If only she could see it."

38:22.360 --> 38:25.432
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

38:28.280 --> 38:31.033
I came up with a possible album title

38:31.720 --> 38:33.756
and took a shot at the cover art.

38:38.640 --> 38:40.073
What do you think?

38:41.880 --> 38:43.518
"Friends with benefit."

38:45.520 --> 38:46.839
I love it.

38:48.680 --> 38:52.229
So I think I want to study Art and Music,

38:52.680 --> 38:54.398
and maybe Business.

38:54.640 --> 38:56.232
Any suggestions?

39:22.720 --> 39:24.631
I hope you got your pants on.

39:28.440 --> 39:29.714
Go home, Danny.

39:30.600 --> 39:32.113
This isn't your life.
