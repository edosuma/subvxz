00:22.423 --> 00:24.959
Good fucking riddance.

00:31.766 --> 00:33.381
What did I say?

00:33.401 --> 00:37.686
I said if we come back here,
they're gonna kill us.

00:37.706 --> 00:38.953
We're alive for a reason.

00:38.973 --> 00:40.622
Lawrence owned the villa.

00:40.642 --> 00:42.657
Milo scammed him out of it

00:42.677 --> 00:44.559
and put it in our names.

00:44.579 --> 00:45.860
What does that mean for us?

00:45.880 --> 00:47.095
My guess is we'll be getting a visit

00:47.115 --> 00:49.330
from his estate lawyer
in the morning.

00:49.350 --> 00:52.687
Till then, we may as well
just get some sleep.

01:01.395 --> 01:05.146
Thanks. Thank you.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.636
Thanks for coming back to get me.

01:09.638 --> 01:11.873
I'm really sorry about this.
I...

01:13.041 --> 01:15.777
I don't know what else to say.

01:28.522 --> 01:29.958
Shit. Hold that.

01:32.661 --> 01:33.708
That's a really nice watch.

01:33.728 --> 01:35.509
Anniversary present.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.946
Got one for Ava, got one for me.

01:37.966 --> 01:39.180
Nice.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.950
But like every other
nice gesture I've tried,

01:41.970 --> 01:43.451
that one blew up in my face, too.

01:43.471 --> 01:44.518
How come?

01:44.538 --> 01:45.887
Ava's niece babysitting.

01:45.907 --> 01:47.421
Lifted the damn thing.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.758
Well, that's too bad.

01:49.778 --> 01:51.292
- Ever get it back?
- Hell no.

01:51.312 --> 01:53.461
Ava just accused me of pawning it

01:53.481 --> 01:54.829
and blaming it on her niece.

01:54.849 --> 01:57.098
Shit just kind of went
downhill from there.

01:57.118 --> 02:00.088
Really hasn't stopped since.

02:02.123 --> 02:03.537
You're good.

02:03.557 --> 02:06.207
- Thank you, man.
- Yeah.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.929
You got it.

02:30.752 --> 02:32.233
Fuck.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.855
Aw, man.

02:44.565 --> 02:47.201
How the hell is he doing that?

02:55.143 --> 02:58.159
Early risers.
My kind of guys.

02:58.179 --> 02:59.728
Let's get you out of Belize, huh?

02:59.748 --> 03:00.795
You're American.

03:00.815 --> 03:02.596
Let me make sure I got this right.

03:02.616 --> 03:03.932
You must be Gus.

03:03.952 --> 03:06.467
Alexander... that's you?

03:06.487 --> 03:08.870
- No.
- I go by Lex.

03:08.890 --> 03:11.806
Okay. What happened?
What happened there?

03:11.826 --> 03:15.076
Oh, the guy, you know,
the cat, the one that...

03:15.096 --> 03:17.545
"The cat" he calls the guy.

03:17.565 --> 03:20.081
Little bastard ran out
of lives, didn't he?

03:20.101 --> 03:21.916
Anyway, that means you're Joel.

03:21.936 --> 03:24.218
- Can you get us home?
- Yes, I can.

03:24.238 --> 03:26.420
And Cobi?

03:26.440 --> 03:28.089
Oh, no. I can't pound you.

03:28.109 --> 03:29.657
You're lousy with berry bugs.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.059
What? What is it?

03:31.079 --> 03:33.962
Berry bugs. Harvest mites.
Nasty little guys.

03:33.982 --> 03:37.231
They cling to tight places,
moist, sweaty places.

03:37.251 --> 03:39.133
They're not...
They're bad news.

03:39.153 --> 03:42.670
Gus, Cobi, Lex, Joel.
Got it. Perfect.

03:42.690 --> 03:45.339
You guys are all from Illinois.
I grew up just north of there.

03:45.359 --> 03:46.808
Like Milwaukee?

03:46.828 --> 03:48.176
This is exciting.

03:48.196 --> 03:50.144
You guys,
you're gonna ace this thing.

03:50.164 --> 03:52.113
- What thing?
- Lawrence will drive you.

03:52.133 --> 03:54.615
I'm Aaron, by the way.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.550
I'll meet you there.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.473
What thing?

04:02.676 --> 04:05.860
Oh, it's a wire.

04:05.880 --> 04:07.481
It's always a wire.

04:46.921 --> 04:48.837
What'd you do?

04:48.857 --> 04:50.939
How'd you beat me? Barrel Boom?

04:50.959 --> 04:52.373
Honey Camp.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.508
I took Manatee Mountain.
Goddamn it.

04:54.528 --> 04:57.846
Well...

04:57.866 --> 05:01.082
Welcome to Camp Chiquibil.

05:01.102 --> 05:03.517
You guys are all perfectly safe here.

05:03.537 --> 05:06.420
You're also free to leave
whenever you please.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.722
Well, thank you.

05:08.742 --> 05:11.359
You should know, Gus,
that there's very little chance

05:11.379 --> 05:13.727
of you ever returning
to Chicago without my help.

05:13.747 --> 05:14.896
Yeah? Why's that?

05:14.916 --> 05:16.297
Well, one, there's DNA evidence

05:16.317 --> 05:18.532
tying one of you
to your friend Milo's death.

05:18.552 --> 05:21.035
Two, you guys are all wanted
in connection to the death

05:21.055 --> 05:23.104
of a local convenience store
owner named Algrove,

05:23.124 --> 05:25.173
who was found face first
in the same swimming pool

05:25.193 --> 05:27.408
as, three, the murdered
police captain.

05:27.428 --> 05:31.412
And that one, I'm pretty sure
you guys actually did.

05:31.432 --> 05:35.149
Oh, and let us not forget
our missing chargé d'affaires.

05:35.169 --> 05:38.086
Just for the record, that
one was a total accident.

05:38.106 --> 05:40.788
Well, even if
you did manage to escape,

05:40.808 --> 05:42.891
make it to the American border,

05:42.911 --> 05:46.614
you'd just be detained
at Immigration.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.031
What is that?

05:50.051 --> 05:51.900
What charge would
Homeland Security hold us on?

05:51.920 --> 05:53.201
Yeah, w-we're Americans.

05:53.221 --> 05:54.635
Are you fucking kidding me?

05:54.655 --> 05:56.971
We drone-kill Americans
in foreign lands.

05:56.991 --> 05:59.073
Why don't you give them
the good news?

05:59.093 --> 06:00.574
The good news is I'm in a position

06:00.594 --> 06:03.177
to make all this go away.
- Aaron has connections.

06:03.197 --> 06:04.645
Not to mention your passports.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.147
Yeah? What do you want from us?

06:06.167 --> 06:07.748
To deliver a package.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.918
In exchange, I'll make
all your problems disappear.

06:09.938 --> 06:11.419
- What package?
- To who?

06:11.439 --> 06:13.054
Those are great questions.
I'll answer them

06:13.074 --> 06:14.288
as soon as I know you're on board.

06:14.308 --> 06:17.058
Guys, guys? This is bullshit.

06:17.078 --> 06:18.993
It's bullshit! Let's go!

06:19.013 --> 06:20.361
Too good to be true, huh?

06:20.381 --> 06:22.096
You know what?
Maybe it is. Maybe it is.

06:22.116 --> 06:24.032
You guys discuss it internally.

06:24.052 --> 06:25.934
I'll give you a moment to huddle up.

06:25.954 --> 06:27.335
All right? Go ahead.

06:27.355 --> 06:28.802
Why are we still standing here?

06:28.822 --> 06:30.238
He said we're free to go.

06:30.258 --> 06:32.540
- You believe that?
- Welcome to Camp Mind Fuck.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.808
Should we even be
talking about this with her?

06:34.828 --> 06:38.812
Coggah Rum?
She's deaf as an adder.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.548
All Aaron's workers are deaf.

06:40.568 --> 06:43.117
But can I give you a steer?
If there's any way

06:43.137 --> 06:44.752
you can get
the rest of that money back,

06:44.772 --> 06:46.487
then do it now.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.456
Because if he finds out it's short,

06:48.476 --> 06:51.059
things could very quickly
take a turn for the worse.

06:51.079 --> 06:54.162
And you care because...?

06:54.182 --> 06:56.664
I think we've seen enough
killing for one week.

06:56.684 --> 06:59.367
If you tell me where it is,
I'll fetch it.

06:59.387 --> 07:00.701
And I'll also bring some paperwork.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.703
You can sign the villa
back over to me.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.993
Put a line under
the whole sorry business.

07:13.401 --> 07:14.983
Th...

07:15.003 --> 07:17.551
- This woman has it... Erica...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:17.571 --> 07:19.320
She works at the pharmacy
at the counter.

07:19.340 --> 07:21.255
Faber's.
- We went to her house.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.191
She skipped town.
It's too late.

07:23.211 --> 07:24.692
What car she drive?

07:24.712 --> 07:27.628
A shit blue Corolla,
but with a busted rear bumper.

07:27.648 --> 07:30.098
That's all I need.
I'll be in touch.

07:30.118 --> 07:31.365
- You happy?
- I got my ass kicked

07:31.385 --> 07:33.001
- defending those people.
- You just killed

07:33.021 --> 07:34.435
- a fucking family.
- They had the money!

07:34.455 --> 07:36.470
- You just killed a family.
- They stole it twice!

07:36.490 --> 07:38.472
I want to go home.
I don't want to die.

07:38.492 --> 07:40.341
So I don't want to go home?
That's what you're saying?

07:40.361 --> 07:43.011
- I don't want to go home?
- All right, good stuff.

07:43.031 --> 07:44.878
Looks like we're all still here.

07:44.898 --> 07:48.069
Are we all still here?

07:51.772 --> 07:52.886
Great.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.675
Let's take the tour.

07:59.047 --> 08:03.031
Of the 103 small businesses
that my parent company founded,

08:03.051 --> 08:05.766
only two of them
have turned a profit.

08:05.786 --> 08:08.869
This is one of them.

08:08.889 --> 08:11.605
God, this thing stinks.

08:11.625 --> 08:14.775
Are those women
whacking off the fish?

08:14.795 --> 08:16.844
Yeah.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.346
Now, this is the secret weapon.

08:18.366 --> 08:20.048
This is the broodstock.

08:20.068 --> 08:21.782
Breeders... healthy,
lipid-rich mothers.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.285
They help us to attain the
highest hatch rates and yields

08:24.305 --> 08:26.420
per acre of any hatchery
in the region.

08:26.440 --> 08:31.345
So it's something we're, uh...
really proud of.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.095
You guys can follow me this way.

08:34.115 --> 08:36.450
This is really cool.

08:42.256 --> 08:45.106
All right. Lex, Gus and Joel,

08:45.126 --> 08:47.408
I'm gonna have you guys sit tight.

08:47.428 --> 08:49.310
Cobi, you're gonna come with me.

08:49.330 --> 08:51.145
We're going to take care
of that berry bug problem.

08:51.165 --> 08:52.380
Oh, great.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.947
What kind of sign language is that?

08:53.967 --> 08:55.216
One of our own devising.

08:55.236 --> 08:57.105
All my employees speak it.

09:05.446 --> 09:07.328
So, uh, that private...

09:07.348 --> 09:10.198
private sign language thing,
it's, like...

09:10.218 --> 09:12.400
it's, like, for secrecy, right?

09:12.420 --> 09:14.102
You ran your own business, correct?

09:14.122 --> 09:15.103
Yeah.

09:15.123 --> 09:16.470
You know, I'm sensing

09:16.490 --> 09:18.339
that you and I
are on a similar wavelength,

09:18.359 --> 09:20.508
but from your friends
I'm sensing dissonance.

09:20.528 --> 09:23.644
Well, I know.
You'd probably be the same

09:23.664 --> 09:25.379
if you had the vacation we just had.

09:25.399 --> 09:28.149
I am not fucking around right now.

09:28.169 --> 09:29.150
Okay.

09:29.170 --> 09:30.184
- Okay?
- Yeah.

09:30.204 --> 09:31.585
I know you went to Guatemala.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.641
I know you crossed
the border last night.

09:36.510 --> 09:37.925
How... how'd you know that?

09:37.945 --> 09:40.194
I'm the guy that makes
things work around here.

09:40.214 --> 09:42.463
I'm the guy that decides
who comes and who goes

09:42.483 --> 09:46.200
and who lives and who doesn't
fucking exist anymore.

09:46.220 --> 09:47.268
Okay. Sure.

09:47.288 --> 09:49.203
But, hey, you made it out.

09:49.223 --> 09:50.871
That's saying something, right?
I mean...

09:50.891 --> 09:53.674
And when your friend needed you,
what'd you do?

09:53.694 --> 09:55.376
You came back.

09:55.396 --> 09:57.678
That's the stuff
that leaders are made of.

09:57.698 --> 10:01.081
So, listen, I'm gonna
need you to be like a...

10:01.101 --> 10:02.850
I don't know, like a project manager.

10:02.870 --> 10:05.085
Keep your friends focused.
Keep 'em positive.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.987
It will literally be the difference

10:07.007 --> 10:08.289
between life and death.

10:08.309 --> 10:10.391
When we pull this off,

10:10.411 --> 10:11.992
I'll make it worth your while.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.862
Really?

10:14.882 --> 10:16.464
Like how?

10:16.484 --> 10:18.466
Let's just say you won't
be working in some office

10:18.486 --> 10:21.001
in a shitty strip mall, wearing
department store suits anymore.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.870
...Yeah. I don't...

10:22.890 --> 10:24.972
I don't work in a...
like, a strip mall.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.407
And if I were you,

10:26.427 --> 10:28.075
I wouldn't mention Guatemala
to your friends.

10:28.095 --> 10:30.144
But I came back, and you just
said that that showed, like...

10:30.164 --> 10:32.180
Right. What we're looking for
is, like, an all-for-one,

10:32.200 --> 10:33.847
one-for-all kind of vibe,

10:33.867 --> 10:35.949
and I wouldn't want them jumping
to the wrong conclusions.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.318
Right.

10:37.338 --> 10:39.119
- You understand?
- Mm-hmm.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.289
All right. This is gonna sting.

10:41.309 --> 10:43.857
What's gonna sting?

10:43.877 --> 10:46.494
Ow! Fuck! Ow!

10:46.514 --> 10:48.329
Why is she wearing that mask?

10:48.349 --> 10:51.619
Fuck! Ow! Ow!

11:03.063 --> 11:04.545
Okay, guys.

11:04.565 --> 11:06.814
This is the, uh... package

11:06.834 --> 11:09.717
that we need to deliver to Jesús...

11:09.737 --> 11:11.685
Along with his money
that you owe him.

11:11.705 --> 11:12.953
That we owe him.

11:12.973 --> 11:13.907
What's in it?

11:15.676 --> 11:17.258
I don't know.

11:17.278 --> 11:18.746
Then why are we delivering it?

11:20.281 --> 11:21.929
Plausible deniability.

11:21.949 --> 11:23.597
They already tried
to get Milo to do it.

11:23.617 --> 11:25.666
Close. I outsourced to Lawrence.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.835
I asked him to deliver
a package to a boat,

11:27.855 --> 11:29.537
bring the boat to
a certain set of coordinates,

11:29.557 --> 11:31.239
and then leave the boat there.

11:31.259 --> 11:34.107
He handed the job off to Milo,
and then it was, you know...

11:34.127 --> 11:35.709
It was a miscommunication.

11:35.729 --> 11:38.379
Miscommunication? A guy in a cat
mask blew his fucking head off.

11:38.399 --> 11:40.448
Yeah, and this guy right here?

11:40.468 --> 11:42.250
He's the one who finally
took care of him.

11:42.270 --> 11:43.651
So maybe we should hear him out.

11:43.671 --> 11:45.919
Okay. Well, why don't you
put an end

11:45.939 --> 11:47.255
to all of our problems

11:47.275 --> 11:48.689
and just FedEx the fucking thing?

11:48.709 --> 11:50.258
Jesús knows
that you were on the boat.

11:50.278 --> 11:51.659
He knows you collected the money.

11:51.679 --> 11:53.126
Therefore, you have to be the ones

11:53.146 --> 11:54.462
to deliver the package to him.

11:54.482 --> 11:56.464
He's kind of expecting you.

11:56.484 --> 11:58.699
Hey, I didn't force you guys
on that boat.

11:58.719 --> 12:01.034
Whoa, Gus! What are you...?!

12:01.054 --> 12:03.771
Hey, what are you doing?!

12:03.791 --> 12:06.807
Peanuts! What is he,
a fucking elephant?

12:06.827 --> 12:08.976
How do you know there wasn't
anthrax in there?

12:08.996 --> 12:10.311
- Shut up!
- Right?

12:10.331 --> 12:12.079
You guys are missing
the point. This is good.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.515
It's good to know the weaknesses
of your team up front.

12:14.535 --> 12:16.684
That's why I conducted this test
with a dummy package.

12:16.704 --> 12:19.019
Now, Gus, you clearly
have some trust issues.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.488
Problems with authority, huh?

12:20.508 --> 12:23.123
Cobi, you need to be
way more assertive, my man.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.025
- Okay.
- And, Lex, if I might,

12:25.045 --> 12:27.361
just a bit too trusting.

12:27.381 --> 12:29.530
And, Joel...

12:29.550 --> 12:32.700
you got some anger in there.

12:32.720 --> 12:34.034
Am I right?

12:34.054 --> 12:36.103
All right, follow me.

12:36.123 --> 12:39.507
You guys are gonna have to hike
15 miles across a rainforest.

12:39.527 --> 12:40.608
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

12:40.628 --> 12:42.109
Are there roads? Can we drive?

12:42.129 --> 12:45.546
There is one road,
but it's crawling with bandits.

12:45.566 --> 12:47.901
Follow me, please, gentlemen.

12:50.471 --> 12:53.474
This is my sundries closet.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.893
You'll find all the knowledge
and supplies

12:59.913 --> 13:01.495
that you'll need for your journey.

13:01.515 --> 13:03.331
Pull this off
and you're homeward bound.

13:03.351 --> 13:04.932
Look, you said it was a day's hike.

13:04.952 --> 13:07.468
Why would we need all this shit?

13:07.488 --> 13:10.604
Maybe you won't. Your call.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.606
Hey. Knowledge is power.

13:12.626 --> 13:17.345
There are things out there.

13:17.365 --> 13:18.812
Insects that can paralyze,

13:18.832 --> 13:22.082
deadly terrain,
unexploded ordnance fields.

13:22.102 --> 13:27.154
But I guess you guys
got it all figured out, huh?

13:27.174 --> 13:29.089
I'll leave you to it.

13:29.109 --> 13:30.824
We need to be on the road
by nightfall

13:30.844 --> 13:33.193
so you can be in position by dawn.

13:33.213 --> 13:37.064
You know, I may be
going out on a limb here,

13:37.084 --> 13:38.866
but given the alternatives,

13:38.886 --> 13:42.002
I just got to say,
I'm impressed with this guy

13:42.022 --> 13:43.537
and his company.

13:43.557 --> 13:47.140
This isn't his company.
This is the company.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.377
This is a CIA front.

13:49.397 --> 13:51.512
You think he's CIA?

13:51.532 --> 13:54.247
- That's good, right?

13:54.267 --> 13:58.519
Lawrence has been CIA-sanctioned
drug trafficking for decades.

13:58.539 --> 14:00.454
- He told you that?
- He works with Aaron,

14:00.474 --> 14:03.991
right, wh-who's paranoid enough
to hire only deaf workers,

14:04.011 --> 14:07.695
who creates his own fucking
sign language, right?

14:07.715 --> 14:09.930
Who kills little people

14:09.950 --> 14:13.421
with fucking crossbows
and gets off on it.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.270
Holy shit!

14:17.290 --> 14:19.627
There's fucking rockets in there!

14:21.294 --> 14:23.544
Well, he's the only person

14:23.564 --> 14:26.313
that actually tried to help us
since we got here.

14:26.333 --> 14:27.615
Yeah. Guess Rochelle
didn't count.

14:27.635 --> 14:28.682
Okay, second person.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.083
Look how we fucked that up.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.520
Okay, well, we'll try
not to fuck it up.

14:32.540 --> 14:34.755
Okay, should we mention
the missing money?

14:34.775 --> 14:36.323
- I mean...
- No!

14:36.343 --> 14:39.993
Jesus Christ, no.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.963
This place might...
might be bugged.

14:42.983 --> 14:43.984
What?

14:45.753 --> 14:48.021
Place might be bugged.

14:50.458 --> 14:52.593
* *

15:06.139 --> 15:08.589
You have an electric cooler now.

15:08.609 --> 15:11.191
The Lord forgives diesel.

15:11.211 --> 15:16.517
I suppose he must also forgive
4G LTE as well.

15:19.119 --> 15:22.102
There's a car left Belize City
not so long ago.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.638
It's traveling on one
of the three highways.

15:24.658 --> 15:28.041
Your people have farms
along all of the highways,

15:28.061 --> 15:31.712
and each of the farmers has a
wife with a phone stashed away.

15:31.732 --> 15:34.748
We agreed to transport
your parcels, nothing more.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.584
We are not a mafia,

15:36.604 --> 15:40.387
and we do not want any part in
violent and treacherous deeds.

15:40.407 --> 15:43.544
I think you've just given me
the title of my memoir.

15:50.518 --> 15:53.521
No, thanks. I carry my own.

15:57.424 --> 15:59.372
The terms of our deal were clear.

15:59.392 --> 16:02.042
I helped you protect your land
against government acquisition

16:02.062 --> 16:04.244
in return for small favors.
This is such a favor.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.313
If I bend any further,
I won't bend back.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.215
I have strayed too far
from righteousness.

16:08.235 --> 16:10.317
That must feel really good.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.419
Question.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.542
Should I shoot Mommy...

16:15.743 --> 16:18.191
or should I shoot boy-o?

16:18.211 --> 16:19.212
Get out!

16:21.048 --> 16:24.431
Much depends on me finding this car.

16:24.451 --> 16:27.154
So what can you do for me?

16:45.739 --> 16:47.675
Enough of this bullshit.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.226
I'm out. I'm out.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.328
- Where are you going?
- Belize City,

16:55.348 --> 16:57.665
because a certain family
might be better off

16:57.685 --> 16:59.620
if I got to them before Lawrence did.

17:05.893 --> 17:07.941
Should we go after him
or should we stay here?

17:07.961 --> 17:10.611
No, just let him go.
He'll come back.

17:10.631 --> 17:12.800
He just needs to blow off some steam.

17:36.890 --> 17:39.660
He's not coming back.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.332
* *

18:26.974 --> 18:30.991
Um, there's been a...
a slight hiccup.

18:31.011 --> 18:33.827
One of the team left, took off.

18:33.847 --> 18:35.162
It was Joel, right?

18:35.182 --> 18:37.665
Gus. Why did you think
it was Joel?

18:37.685 --> 18:39.399
Cobi, I asked you
to manage your team.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.368
Yeah. Um, I know.

18:41.388 --> 18:44.938
Well, you know, I didn't
think he was gonna do it.

18:44.958 --> 18:47.808
But then I was pretty sure
that, you know,

18:47.828 --> 18:49.777
he was gonna come back.

18:49.797 --> 18:52.145
So I'm-I'm not exactly sure

18:52.165 --> 18:57.517
if this, like, affects things
m-moving forward.

18:57.537 --> 18:58.852
Yes. Yes, it does.

18:58.872 --> 19:00.220
There's an expectation

19:00.240 --> 19:02.042
that the four of you
will arrive together.

19:04.745 --> 19:05.879
Ooh.

19:19.226 --> 19:21.094
Sir!

19:22.195 --> 19:23.410
Excuse me.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.713
I'm sorry. Excuse me, sir.

19:25.733 --> 19:27.547
Sir, excuse me.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.136
Excuse me.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.740
Sir, excuse me.

19:35.575 --> 19:36.724
Oh!

19:36.744 --> 19:38.311
¡Corre! ¡Corre! ¡Corre!

19:45.786 --> 19:47.067
What was that?

19:47.087 --> 19:49.069
That would be the ordnance field.

19:49.089 --> 19:50.503
There's a quarry out there.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.072
In the colonial days,

19:52.092 --> 19:54.742
the British Army used it
for artillery practice.

19:54.762 --> 19:57.931
When Gus left, did he go east?

20:22.222 --> 20:23.771
Efrain.

20:23.791 --> 20:25.739
Gus.

20:25.759 --> 20:27.194
Sorry about that.

20:29.763 --> 20:32.145
You must walk carefully.

20:32.165 --> 20:33.814
Follow my footsteps exactly.

20:33.834 --> 20:35.883
So you, uh, you work with bombs?

20:35.903 --> 20:38.185
Yeah. Yes.

20:38.205 --> 20:41.308
Scrap metal.
Good price. Good price.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.726
Listen.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.929
No, I need to get to Belize City.

20:48.949 --> 20:51.484
Oh, Belize City, yeah.

20:56.023 --> 20:59.306
Follow me. Step where I step.

20:59.326 --> 21:01.428
- No safe.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.332
Hello. Efrain.

21:24.885 --> 21:28.155
Wait. Hey! I need your help!

21:32.893 --> 21:34.361
Come back here!

21:35.896 --> 21:37.865
Hey!

21:40.633 --> 21:42.069
Somebody!

21:49.276 --> 21:50.978
Help!

21:52.946 --> 21:56.663
- Gus!
- Gus!

21:56.683 --> 21:58.318
Gus!

21:59.386 --> 22:01.534
Gus!

22:01.554 --> 22:03.270
Hey, guys?

22:03.290 --> 22:05.072
- Hey, man!
- No, no, no, no, no.

22:05.092 --> 22:07.074
- No, no, no, no!
- What?

22:07.094 --> 22:09.709
Do not take another step!
Stop!

22:09.729 --> 22:12.079
Do not take one step further.

22:12.099 --> 22:15.382
It's a minefield.
We've already had an explosion.

22:15.402 --> 22:17.750
Please do not take another step.

22:17.770 --> 22:18.952
What are you doing?

22:18.972 --> 22:20.553
- Lex! Stop!
- What are you doing?

22:20.573 --> 22:22.622
I got it! I got it.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.011
This was in my materials.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.198
What are you doing?

22:31.218 --> 22:34.034
I'm gonna use this
as a demining needle.

22:34.054 --> 22:35.735
Lex, you don't have to do this, Lex.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.204
Hey, come on, man.

22:37.224 --> 22:39.927
It's all of us or none of us.

22:44.731 --> 22:47.047
I respect what you did.

22:47.067 --> 22:49.049
It t-takes a lot of balls

22:49.069 --> 22:50.918
to cross a minefield to save a girl.

22:50.938 --> 22:54.554
I didn't know it was a minefield
when I started crossing it.

22:54.574 --> 22:56.389
Lex!

22:56.409 --> 22:58.825
You're gonna hit one of them
with that stick, Lex.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.460
No. I just need to be careful.

23:00.480 --> 23:04.384
You know, a light touch
does not trigger the explosive.

23:12.960 --> 23:15.562
Gus, Ava's watch.

23:18.698 --> 23:20.313
It was me.

23:20.333 --> 23:21.848
What?

23:21.868 --> 23:23.570
I stole it.

23:25.605 --> 23:27.120
What do you mean?

23:27.140 --> 23:30.123
I stole it, Gus. I stole it.

23:30.143 --> 23:31.959
Why are you telling me this now?

23:31.979 --> 23:33.660
If not now, when?

23:33.680 --> 23:37.264
Look, it-it was a long time ago.
It was a different life.

23:37.284 --> 23:39.599
I owed money all over town,

23:39.619 --> 23:45.472
and-and it was an easy fix
to a very... difficult problem.

23:45.492 --> 23:48.108
I'm-I'm ashamed and embarrassed
to admit it, okay?

23:48.128 --> 23:52.812
But I can't... I mean,
we can't move forward.

23:52.832 --> 23:54.414
So you're just telling me
some fucked-up shit

23:54.434 --> 23:56.416
while you're saving my ass, right?

23:56.436 --> 23:58.018
Didn't I tell you I was done
being manipulated?

23:58.038 --> 23:59.319
I am sorry.

23:59.339 --> 24:02.389
I just hope I can
make it up to you, Gus.

24:02.409 --> 24:03.643
That's all.

24:10.683 --> 24:12.452
Almost.

24:19.192 --> 24:22.429
Here you go. Right here.

24:24.497 --> 24:27.080
Come on.

24:27.100 --> 24:28.535
You step on it.

24:30.670 --> 24:33.140
Come on, man.

24:36.543 --> 24:38.045
Sorry.

24:42.049 --> 24:44.151
Follow me, all right?

24:46.419 --> 24:50.837
I mean, maybe
all this studying stuff,

24:50.857 --> 24:52.605
maybe it's really paid off.

24:52.625 --> 24:54.274
We're proving
that we're an effective team.

24:54.294 --> 24:56.109
Sounds like Aaron gave you

24:56.129 --> 24:57.810
some really good
fucking Kool-Aid.

24:57.830 --> 25:00.347
No, I'm serious.
This is great.

25:00.367 --> 25:02.249
Something like that happens,

25:02.269 --> 25:04.051
all your resentment towards
each other goes away.

25:04.071 --> 25:05.685
You start letting go of secrets.

25:05.705 --> 25:10.590
I mean, people pay a fortune
to do this at, like, retreats.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.359
You plan on telling us
where you disappeared to

25:12.379 --> 25:13.926
after you got out of quarantine?

25:13.946 --> 25:15.162
Did you go to Guatemala?

25:15.182 --> 25:16.963
You know what?

25:16.983 --> 25:18.931
Yep, that's what I did.

25:18.951 --> 25:20.467
I went to Guatemala.

25:20.487 --> 25:23.403
Then I came back to help out.

25:23.423 --> 25:25.705
What did you do in Guatemala?

25:25.725 --> 25:27.507
I went to the embassy.

25:27.527 --> 25:29.876
I was trying to get
your passports back.

25:29.896 --> 25:30.877
What'd you do?

25:30.897 --> 25:33.246
Went for a walk.

25:33.266 --> 25:36.183
Played soccer with some Argentineans.

25:36.203 --> 25:39.419
Really?

25:39.439 --> 25:40.787
Yeah.

25:40.807 --> 25:44.524
Let's get back
and get this thing over with.

25:44.544 --> 25:46.479
* *

26:12.972 --> 26:16.022
I'm entrusting this with you.

26:16.042 --> 26:19.126
If anyone in this group
is a born leader, it's you.

26:19.146 --> 26:20.727
I thought you made Cobi the leader.

26:20.747 --> 26:24.264
Real leaders don't lie
and undermine their team.

26:24.284 --> 26:25.965
They don't brown-nose either.

26:25.985 --> 26:27.800
Real leaders take action,

26:27.820 --> 26:30.503
save their friend
from an ordnance field.

26:30.523 --> 26:32.038
Hey, you're coming with us, right?

26:32.058 --> 26:33.039
No.

26:33.059 --> 26:34.407
There's a surprise.

26:34.427 --> 26:35.842
I like to keep a certain distance.

26:35.862 --> 26:37.744
You guys are gonna need
your car, though.

26:37.764 --> 26:39.412
The car's at the villa.

26:39.432 --> 26:41.314
Villa's probably teeming with cops.

26:41.334 --> 26:44.684
Right, right.

26:44.704 --> 26:47.307
You're too much.

26:49.742 --> 26:52.325
Okay.

26:52.345 --> 26:56.629
This, uh, this payment was in
Euro notes, right?

26:56.649 --> 26:57.964
500 Euro notes?

26:57.984 --> 27:00.420
As far as we know.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.790
It's light.

27:06.092 --> 27:09.075
Well, um... um...

27:09.095 --> 27:11.231
It's all the money we have.

27:14.667 --> 27:18.738
So you don't...
have all the money?

27:21.541 --> 27:24.624
You don't have all the money?

27:24.644 --> 27:27.214
Why did no one tell me this before?

27:29.216 --> 27:32.665
Well, uh...

27:32.685 --> 27:34.000
It was Lawrence.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.288
Lawrence knew about this?

27:40.393 --> 27:43.630
Fuck! Fuck! God!

27:46.533 --> 27:49.282
Jesús needs all of that money!

27:49.302 --> 27:51.284
By extension,
you need all of that money!

27:51.304 --> 27:52.852
Do you underst...

27:52.872 --> 27:54.607
Christ on a fucking bike!

27:56.376 --> 27:58.611
Goddamn it!

28:00.613 --> 28:02.749
How much of it is missing?

28:04.917 --> 28:06.399
Tell me right now.

28:06.419 --> 28:07.567
- Half.
- We know who has it.

28:07.587 --> 28:09.101
We-we just have to find it.

28:09.121 --> 28:10.270
We're running out of time,

28:10.290 --> 28:11.671
so this is what we're gonna do.

28:11.691 --> 28:13.673
We're gonna get in this car,

28:13.693 --> 28:16.343
and we're gonna think about how
we're gonna get that money back,

28:16.363 --> 28:19.946
and we are gonna think
very fucking clearly!

28:19.966 --> 28:23.350
We'll split up if we have to,

28:23.370 --> 28:25.572
but we are going to get
that money back.

28:40.653 --> 28:42.322
Go! Go!

28:44.291 --> 28:45.625
Yeah, go.

28:56.303 --> 28:58.184
- What's going on here?
- My apologies.

28:58.204 --> 29:03.189
But, please, there's a path
through my farm, huh?

29:03.209 --> 29:05.345
Just back up.

29:09.782 --> 29:11.318
Back up.

29:16.456 --> 29:18.305
So she just didn't show up?

29:18.325 --> 29:19.472
No notice at all?

29:19.492 --> 29:22.141
You have any idea where she went?

29:22.161 --> 29:24.577
- No. Sorry.
- Fuck.

29:24.597 --> 29:26.313
I'm leaving my number.

29:26.333 --> 29:28.315
I can't sell you any more pills.

29:28.335 --> 29:30.950
Me? I don't... Okay.

29:30.970 --> 29:32.939
I don't want any pills.

29:34.474 --> 29:36.556
Hey, what you want, eh?

29:36.576 --> 29:39.392
Xanax? Cialis? Viagra?

29:39.412 --> 29:42.161
What? No, no. I'm-I'm fine.

29:42.181 --> 29:43.830
I'm looking for somebody.

29:43.850 --> 29:45.064
Oh, who?

29:45.084 --> 29:46.533
Erica. She works here.

29:46.553 --> 29:49.101
Erica! She me sister's friend.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.403
She around here, you know.

29:50.423 --> 29:52.572
- Come, come, come.
- Wait. Gus.

29:52.592 --> 29:54.441
- Come.
- Well, wait, let me...

29:54.461 --> 29:56.343
No, she around the corner
havin' a smoke.

29:56.363 --> 29:57.610
- Where?
- Come, come. Down here.

29:57.630 --> 29:59.432
Wait, where are we going?

30:03.269 --> 30:04.384
Speak.

30:04.404 --> 30:06.052
Ashenfelter Farms

30:06.072 --> 30:08.721
on the Western Highway,
and you'll find the money.

30:08.741 --> 30:10.256
Why didn't you tell me
half of it was missing?

30:10.276 --> 30:13.059
I solved a problem
you didn't even know existed.

30:13.079 --> 30:14.293
That's the benefit of having someone

30:14.313 --> 30:15.462
who really knows the place.

30:15.482 --> 30:17.129
It's called experience, Aaron.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.431
I don't like secrecy.

30:18.451 --> 30:19.499
The CIA man doesn't like secrecy?

30:19.519 --> 30:20.667
Or attitude.

30:20.687 --> 30:22.369
Oh, here's some attitude for you.

30:22.389 --> 30:23.803
Go fuck yourself!

30:23.823 --> 30:26.573
The whole lot of you smug,
shiny wankers!

30:26.593 --> 30:28.375
You'd be nothing
without people like me.

30:28.395 --> 30:29.542
Be careful now.

30:29.562 --> 30:31.010
You killed my friend.

30:31.030 --> 30:32.412
Yeah, well,

30:32.432 --> 30:34.834
sometimes people stop being useful.

30:38.304 --> 30:39.739
How much further?

30:44.076 --> 30:45.077
Now!

30:48.114 --> 30:50.897
* *

30:50.917 --> 30:52.999
Hey!

30:53.019 --> 30:55.422
Hey! Hey!

30:58.324 --> 31:00.373
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

31:00.393 --> 31:03.162
Hey! Hey!

31:04.997 --> 31:06.533
What?!

31:11.438 --> 31:12.839
Jesus Christ!

31:15.041 --> 31:18.778
Hey, I'd wear that shirt, okay?
I'm serious.

31:24.584 --> 31:26.599
All right, good news.

31:26.619 --> 31:28.267
Lawrence really showed
some hustle today.

31:28.287 --> 31:29.769
Found the Diggs family,

31:29.789 --> 31:31.504
which means we are one step
closer to the money.

31:31.524 --> 31:33.072
Are they okay?

31:33.092 --> 31:35.795
The family? Erica?

31:37.564 --> 31:39.579
What in the holy crap
are you wearing?

31:39.599 --> 31:41.814
He got rolled by some teenage girls.

31:41.834 --> 31:44.917
All right, we're gonna pick up
the rental car at the villa.

31:44.937 --> 31:47.474
You guys will follow me
from there. Copy?

32:16.903 --> 32:20.119
Okay. So, apparently,
they are reluctant to reveal

32:20.139 --> 32:24.624
where they're hiding the cash,
which is unfortunate.

32:24.644 --> 32:27.179
Which one of you has
the most trust with Erica?

32:29.882 --> 32:31.017
I do.

32:32.585 --> 32:34.233
Hammer, safety, trigger.

32:34.253 --> 32:37.203
Do not come out of there
without an answer.

32:37.223 --> 32:40.372
I'll go in there,
but I'm not touching that.

32:40.392 --> 32:41.708
Okay, don't worry.

32:41.728 --> 32:43.676
I'm taking it
to make sure nobody uses it.

32:43.696 --> 32:45.512
All right? Is the safety on?

32:45.532 --> 32:46.746
You guys are gonna do great in there.

32:46.766 --> 32:48.347
Wait. Aren't you
coming in with us?

32:48.367 --> 32:49.736
Plausible deniability.

33:00.547 --> 33:02.749
In there.

33:05.752 --> 33:09.589
And watch out for the old woman.

33:13.626 --> 33:15.542
Erica.

33:15.562 --> 33:17.009
I came to Punta Gorda to save you.

33:17.029 --> 33:19.311
Well, he crossed
a minefield to save you.

33:19.331 --> 33:22.582
Your granny stole half our
money. She's why you're here.

33:22.602 --> 33:24.350
- Okay... -The last time
you came looking for me,

33:24.370 --> 33:25.685
you said it wasn't your money.

33:25.705 --> 33:27.787
Okay, okay!
Guys, okay, listen.

33:27.807 --> 33:29.141
I'm opening the gate.

33:33.212 --> 33:34.894
It's still not our money.

33:34.914 --> 33:36.328
Okay, we're not the bad guys here.

33:36.348 --> 33:37.897
- We are here to help you!

33:37.917 --> 33:39.365
Will someone shut the fucking dog up?

33:39.385 --> 33:41.100
Okay, we're all just
trying to survive!

33:41.120 --> 33:42.434
You, us, everybody.

33:42.454 --> 33:43.903
Then why are you waving a gun at us?

33:43.923 --> 33:46.639
Here, look. No waving, okay?

33:46.659 --> 33:48.007
We're all intelligent people here.

33:48.027 --> 33:49.609
You want to know the truth?

33:49.629 --> 33:51.811
She won't even tell me
where she hid it.

33:51.831 --> 33:53.412
Does she underst... goddamn...

33:53.432 --> 33:54.981
Does she understand

33:55.001 --> 33:57.383
that her entire family
could die over this?

33:57.403 --> 33:59.085
Not to mention us.

33:59.105 --> 34:01.220
Okay, look, you have to reason
with her.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.355
Enough of this shit!

34:03.375 --> 34:05.592
...What the fuck are you doing?!

34:05.612 --> 34:06.993
Put it down! Put that down!

34:07.013 --> 34:09.094
- No! This ends now!

34:09.114 --> 34:10.663
Shut the fuck up!

34:10.683 --> 34:11.964
It's fine. Look, it's fine.
It's fine.

34:11.984 --> 34:14.033
- Where's the money?!
- Cobi!

34:14.053 --> 34:16.101
Hey!

34:16.121 --> 34:17.603
- What is that?
- Give me this!

34:17.623 --> 34:19.271
Shut up! Shut up!

34:19.291 --> 34:20.693
Stop! Please!

34:40.346 --> 34:42.281
Where's the money?

34:57.664 --> 35:01.013
Okay, time to get back on track.

35:01.033 --> 35:03.249
Just a car ride away, boys.

35:03.269 --> 35:06.372
Victory...
it's within your reach.

35:14.113 --> 35:16.195
The five of us,

35:16.215 --> 35:22.201
we all come from
a long legacy of victors.

35:22.221 --> 35:25.204
American exceptionalism.
Don't forget that.

35:25.224 --> 35:28.374
Our ancestors harnessed
the power of a fucking atom

35:28.394 --> 35:31.243
and used it to bring
an empire to its knees.

35:31.263 --> 35:33.212
History is on your side!

35:33.232 --> 35:35.047
You're strong, you're dominant.

35:35.067 --> 35:38.751
I look at each one of you,

35:38.771 --> 35:41.207
and I see greatness.

35:47.513 --> 35:49.161
He's on some bullshit.

35:49.181 --> 35:51.330
We're gonna end up
like that fucking dog

35:51.350 --> 35:52.699
if we deliver this thing.

35:52.719 --> 35:54.320
If we stay, we will.

36:01.260 --> 36:03.095
What's in that package?

36:07.266 --> 36:12.018
Okay. I want you
to treat this package

36:12.038 --> 36:15.822
as you would a child, all right?

36:15.842 --> 36:19.291
Don't shake it,
don't open it. Gus?

36:19.311 --> 36:22.895
And remember, gentlemen,
this is for Jesús,

36:22.915 --> 36:25.284
and Jesús only.

36:27.653 --> 36:30.302
What about our passports?

36:30.322 --> 36:32.338
You can have them when you get back.

36:32.358 --> 36:33.926
If we get back.

36:46.773 --> 36:48.374
Hey, guys?

36:49.909 --> 36:52.011
Safe travels.

37:13.800 --> 37:16.648
- We good?
- Yep, it's all here.

37:16.668 --> 37:20.619
Minus a few bills that we
spent along the way, but...

37:20.639 --> 37:25.244
"Delivery of insufficient funds
will result in violence."

37:48.500 --> 37:50.269
* *

37:59.378 --> 38:00.692
Did you see that?

38:00.712 --> 38:03.115
See what?

38:04.483 --> 38:06.318
Nothing. Whatever.

38:21.367 --> 38:23.115
Nothing.

38:23.135 --> 38:29.521
* I see a red door
and I want it painted black *

38:29.541 --> 38:36.628
* No colors anymore,
I want them to turn black *

38:36.648 --> 38:39.031
* I see the girls walk by *

38:39.051 --> 38:43.202
* Dressed in their summer clothes *

38:43.222 --> 38:50.162
* I have to turn my head
until my darkness goes *

39:03.509 --> 39:10.329
* I see a line of cars
and they're all painted black *

39:10.349 --> 39:17.169
* With flowers and my love,
both never to come back *

39:17.189 --> 39:23.642
* I see people turn their heads
and quickly look away *

39:23.662 --> 39:30.449
* Like a newborn baby,
it just happens every day *

39:30.469 --> 39:37.289
* I look inside myself
and see my heart is black *

39:37.309 --> 39:43.930
* I see my red door
and it has been painted black *

39:43.950 --> 39:50.736
* Maybe then I'll fade away
and not have to face the facts *

39:50.756 --> 39:59.565
* It's not easy facing up
when your whole world is black *

40:04.070 --> 40:07.619
* Oh... *

40:07.639 --> 40:10.889
* Oh *

40:10.909 --> 40:14.426
* Oh... *

40:14.446 --> 40:16.462
* Oh *

40:16.482 --> 40:23.169
* I want to see your face
painted black *

40:23.189 --> 40:25.938
* Black as night *

40:25.958 --> 40:28.527
* Black as coal. *
