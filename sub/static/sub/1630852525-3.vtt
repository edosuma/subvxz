WEBVTT

00:04.571 --> 00:09.409
- I feel like I'm in the dark, like with no light in sight.

00:09.509 --> 00:12.879
Life is  not  turning out the way it was promised.

00:12.979 --> 00:16.349
I just feel like the whole world is against me.

00:16.416 --> 00:18.585
And like, everything that I try to do

00:18.685 --> 00:20.253
just gets like chomped, chewed

00:20.353 --> 00:23.056
and like pooped out right before my eyes.

00:23.156 --> 00:25.425
- And here's the question I always ask you,

00:25.525 --> 00:27.394
whose fault do you think that is?

00:27.494 --> 00:29.929
- And here's the answer I always give you--

00:30.030 --> 00:31.531
not mine.

00:31.598 --> 00:33.700
You know, I feel like I've stopped trusting the world

00:33.767 --> 00:36.603
to the point that I don't even know what's true anymore.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.605
And I can't help but feeling like

00:38.705 --> 00:41.374
there's big forces against me at play

00:41.441 --> 00:43.276
and I'm being sabotaged.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.279
Otherwise it would mean that things are my fault,

00:46.379 --> 00:49.182
and that just can't be true! - Okay.

00:49.249 --> 00:51.718
That's enough for you. Leave your cash in the basket.

00:51.785 --> 00:54.287
Don't let my next client see you on the way out.

00:56.122 --> 01:00.226
- Hi. Hot dog, no bun, just relish, cup style.

01:00.293 --> 01:02.195
- What's cup style?

01:02.262 --> 01:03.763
- In a cup.

01:03.863 --> 01:06.299
Quick, I just had therapy.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.635
- An entire airplane

01:08.735 --> 01:11.104
carrying a major national football team

01:11.204 --> 01:13.239
disappears on a domestic flight

01:13.306 --> 01:15.742
on the same day that Jay Harry Swanson

01:15.809 --> 01:18.144
becomes the new director of the CIA.

01:18.244 --> 01:21.614
And not a single email is sent about this change of hands.

01:21.714 --> 01:24.617
You ever got a new boss without even a heads up?

01:24.717 --> 01:26.086
I didn't think so.

01:26.152 --> 01:28.321
Makes you wanna clench your asshole so tight

01:28.421 --> 01:29.789
it ruptures like hell.

01:29.889 --> 01:32.158
- Crazy. - These people know your name.

01:32.258 --> 01:34.060
They know how you like to scratch your legs.

01:34.127 --> 01:36.663
They even know the rolodex of attractive people

01:36.763 --> 01:38.231
you keep in your head

01:38.298 --> 01:39.732
when you go to pleasure yourself.

01:39.799 --> 01:42.502
- God... what is with her?

01:42.602 --> 01:44.270
- You're just sandwiches to them.

01:44.337 --> 01:45.738
That's right.

01:45.805 --> 01:48.675
I'm talking to you and you and you and you and you.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.444
I can tell you don't trust the world,

01:51.511 --> 01:54.114
and you know everyone's against you,

01:54.180 --> 01:56.182
mocking your dumb as shit life.

01:56.282 --> 01:57.984
- - Well, there's a reason why

01:58.084 --> 02:00.186
you feel freaky deaky all the time.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.088
It's because you're being hunted.

02:02.155 --> 02:04.424
Well, welcome to the jungle, baby.

02:04.491 --> 02:06.426
You are nothing but prey here.

02:06.493 --> 02:08.761
Prey here...here...here...

02:21.708 --> 02:23.510
- What's up big dogs?

02:23.610 --> 02:25.645
Slurping on some caffeine soup?

02:25.712 --> 02:27.714
- Oh, you know it, bro. Living the dream,

02:27.814 --> 02:30.150
taking people's homes away, and getting rich quick.

02:30.216 --> 02:32.819
- That's what's up. That's what's up.

02:32.886 --> 02:35.288
That's what's up, that's what's up.

02:38.691 --> 02:41.494
- Hi. - Uh...

02:41.561 --> 02:43.329
Hi. Um...

02:43.396 --> 02:45.498
What are you doing here?

02:50.003 --> 02:51.237
- I got the sense yesterday

02:51.337 --> 02:52.405
that you still have

02:52.505 --> 02:54.874
some bitter feelings toward me,

02:54.974 --> 02:56.509
so I wanted to come by and

02:56.576 --> 02:58.144
say I'm sorry.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.380
- Okay.

03:04.150 --> 03:05.585
- I saw this...

03:05.685 --> 03:07.053
this app you're building.

03:07.153 --> 03:08.888
- Hmm.

03:08.988 --> 03:11.391
- Is this really the kind of work you wanna be doing?

03:11.491 --> 03:13.660
- Yeah, well, it's kinda where the world's headed,

03:13.726 --> 03:15.261
so, yeah, it is.

03:15.361 --> 03:16.596
- Mm.

03:19.699 --> 03:22.435
I know about you and Portia.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.571
And if she makes you happy,

03:24.671 --> 03:30.009
then I think that's great, because I want you to be happy.

03:30.076 --> 03:35.048
- Well, you know, she doesn't make me kill people, so...

03:37.750 --> 03:39.786
- I know I deserve that,

03:42.288 --> 03:45.592
But I also know how much we care about each other.

03:46.626 --> 03:49.295
I love you and you love me.

03:49.395 --> 03:51.197
And that's why you're angry still,

03:51.264 --> 03:53.566
because still have feelings for me.

03:53.633 --> 03:57.804
- Okay. If you don't leave, I'm gonna call security.

04:01.741 --> 04:02.642
Okay.

04:43.149 --> 04:45.418
- Hello.

04:57.597 --> 05:00.466
Ah...

05:13.212 --> 05:16.549
Oh, I got you.

05:19.552 --> 05:22.822
I got you now you beautiful bastard.

05:29.495 --> 05:32.198
No, no. I had him. I had him.

05:33.733 --> 05:36.969
Ahh...end.

05:37.036 --> 05:38.237
Hello? What?

05:38.338 --> 05:40.406
- Dory Sief is arriving, Mr. Quinn.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.141
- Oh.

05:43.409 --> 05:45.511
Uh, thank you.

05:46.212 --> 05:49.749
- I can't believe we're at Tunnel Industries, El.

05:49.849 --> 05:52.518
This is crazy. What do you think he's gonna be like?

05:52.585 --> 05:54.987
- Oh, I mean, we're not gonna meet the Tunnel Quinn.

05:55.054 --> 05:56.823
They'll just send some nerd who works for him.

05:56.889 --> 05:58.424
- Right, right, right, right, right.

05:59.692 --> 06:03.262
Oh my God, is that Drew with Dory?

06:03.363 --> 06:05.231
- They're fucking. - What?

06:05.331 --> 06:07.200
- They're absolutely fucking. - How do you know that?

06:07.266 --> 06:08.935
- I know on some level they're fucking.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.437
- Hi, you two. both: Hi.

06:11.537 --> 06:13.573
- Wow, right?

06:13.673 --> 06:16.075
Oh, isn't this exciting? - It's so amazing.

06:16.175 --> 06:17.944
- It's so good. I love your glasses.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.779
You like my outfit? - Yeah. Amazing.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.447
- Hi. How are you? - Hey.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.950
- I'm so happy you guys joined me, you know?

06:24.050 --> 06:25.785
I don't really know what to expect,

06:25.885 --> 06:27.920
so it means a lot to have you guys by my side.

06:28.020 --> 06:30.723
- You know, I gotta say now that someone very famous

06:30.790 --> 06:32.058
has acknowledge you, Dory,

06:32.125 --> 06:34.260
I do feel bad for calling you crazy

06:34.360 --> 06:35.962
and committing you to a mental institution.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.598
- - Same.

06:38.698 --> 06:40.800
- Ha ha. My best friends.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.602
- - Welcome to you all.

06:42.702 --> 06:43.903
Look at you.

06:43.970 --> 06:46.406
Welcome to my, uh, my playland.

06:46.472 --> 06:48.474
Do you like it? You feeling somewhat inspired?

06:48.574 --> 06:49.976
- Oh my God. - Yes.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.411
- It's actually him. It's actually him.

06:51.477 --> 06:52.945
- Okay. Come, follow me.

06:53.045 --> 06:54.714
This way, it's right up the stairs.

06:54.781 --> 06:57.450
You are a genius. Can I tell you that?

06:57.550 --> 06:59.652
I'm sure, but so while I got you here,

06:59.752 --> 07:02.422
I gotta get your perspective on something top secret

07:02.488 --> 07:03.890
that I'm working on.

07:03.956 --> 07:06.159
In fact, I wanna get it from all of you.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.560
- Hmm. - What is it?

07:07.627 --> 07:10.329
- It is groundbreaking.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.931
Um...literally.

07:11.998 --> 07:15.268
Because I'm digging a hole...

07:15.334 --> 07:18.171
to the center of the earth,

07:18.271 --> 07:20.606
and I'm taking you there.

07:20.673 --> 07:22.675
- What? - Uh-huh, uh-huh!

07:22.775 --> 07:24.243
Uh-huh! - Come on!

07:24.310 --> 07:26.112
- Uh-huh, uh-huh!

07:27.113 --> 07:28.114
Hello.

07:28.181 --> 07:29.949
Thank you. - Thank you.

07:30.016 --> 07:31.784
- Thank you. -

07:31.851 --> 07:33.953
Yeah, she's too rough with me.

07:34.020 --> 07:35.688
Very good. Thank you, everybody.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.623
Thank you so much. - Cool.

07:37.690 --> 07:39.659
- So this is the elevator that takes us to

07:39.759 --> 07:42.762
like the floor with pictures of the earth's core right?

07:42.829 --> 07:44.197
Or like--where where--

07:44.297 --> 07:46.432
like, wh-where exactly is it that we're going?

07:46.499 --> 07:48.968
- No, no, we're going to the center of the earth,

07:49.035 --> 07:50.102
like I said.

07:50.169 --> 07:51.537
- Really? - Yep.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.606
- I'll try anything once. - Good.

07:53.673 --> 07:55.541
- I'm confused. Wouldn't we need like training for that?

07:55.641 --> 07:57.543
- Training? What kind of training would that entail?

07:57.643 --> 07:59.846
- I'm sorry, this is too tight. I can't get out of it,

07:59.946 --> 08:01.881
and I really don't like things touching my necklace bones.

08:01.981 --> 08:04.383
So yeah, I just don't think I wanna do this.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.053
- That makes sense, 'cause this is very unnatural.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.388
Here, chew on this, if you will.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.291
Take one, pass one down. - Okay.

08:12.358 --> 08:13.893
- This is gonna raise your blood pressure

08:13.993 --> 08:16.128
and keep you from getting dizzy.

08:16.195 --> 08:17.563
But don't swallow it.

08:17.663 --> 08:20.399
It takes seven years for gum to digest.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.834
Ooh!

08:21.901 --> 08:23.402
We're sealed in now.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.906
- Initiating in three, two, one.

08:27.006 --> 08:29.575
- Oh God. Ohh.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.177
Oh my God.

08:31.244 --> 08:34.881
- How many, um, feet are we going?

08:34.981 --> 08:38.150
- 3,558 miles,

08:38.217 --> 08:39.685
which I know is disappointing,

08:39.752 --> 08:41.254
but we're not yet able to get to

08:41.354 --> 08:43.089
that final 400 miles of core core.

08:43.189 --> 08:46.526
Uh, we would die so-- - How long is this gonna take?

08:46.592 --> 08:48.895
- Oh, this is gonna take about nine hours.

08:48.995 --> 08:51.664
Oh, oh, I should have told you to pee.

08:51.731 --> 08:53.099
Well, you're gonna pee anyway, so...

08:53.199 --> 08:55.268
- No! - No, no, no. I can't, I can't.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.270
I can't, I can't. I mean, this is insane.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.272
I have to get off of the elevator.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.773
- It's okay. Just keep chewing.

09:00.873 --> 09:03.509
Chew, chew, chew, chewing the gum. It's good.

09:03.576 --> 09:05.177
Hey, you know how lucky you are?

09:05.244 --> 09:07.446
So few people have ever gotten a chance to do this,

09:07.547 --> 09:09.715
and trust me, you're gonna be so amazed

09:09.782 --> 09:12.218
at some of the insane s-h-i-tut

09:12.285 --> 09:13.352
that you're about to see.

09:13.419 --> 09:15.521
It's gonna get real cool, guys.

09:15.588 --> 09:17.890
- Oh my God, no!

09:17.957 --> 09:20.359
- Hey, Aspen, sweetie,

09:20.426 --> 09:21.894
I'm gonna go for a run.

09:21.961 --> 09:24.697
You're okay to be here on your own, right?

09:24.764 --> 09:27.033
- All right. Have a wonderful run, Fathers.

09:27.099 --> 09:28.968
- Oh, it's just me. Your other father

09:29.068 --> 09:30.937
didn't come home last night.

09:31.037 --> 09:32.939
He is working on hurting me.

09:33.039 --> 09:36.709
- Hey Kikei, do you mind keeping an eye on my child

09:36.776 --> 09:38.978
while I'm out? He's a hoot.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.914
- Okay, Mr. Marc. I'm not putting in chlorine this week,

09:41.981 --> 09:44.317
just lavender, because the chlorine,

09:44.417 --> 09:47.119
it gets in the skin and it's really bad.

09:47.219 --> 09:48.955
- Oh, smart.

09:49.055 --> 09:52.058
Love the puka shells by the way.

09:52.124 --> 09:54.060
- Thank you, Mr. Marc.

09:54.126 --> 09:56.162
- Okay. Bye, sweetie.

10:14.313 --> 10:17.617
- I should say it does get real, real hot

10:17.683 --> 10:19.452
around this 50-mile mark.

10:19.518 --> 10:21.954
- What? We still have so much more left to go.

10:22.021 --> 10:24.857
- So much farther. Oh, it's gonna get crazy, you guys.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.659
Oh, and faster.

10:28.194 --> 10:29.595
Hang on.

10:29.662 --> 10:31.764
- It hurts. It hurts.

10:31.831 --> 10:34.133
- Mr. Quinn!

10:34.200 --> 10:35.668
You stop this elevator right now

10:35.768 --> 10:37.370
and you bring back to the surface of the earth,

10:37.470 --> 10:39.271
and that is an order! - Sorry, I can't do that.

10:39.338 --> 10:41.107
This works with magnetic propulsion.

10:41.173 --> 10:42.375
We have to arrive at our destination

10:42.475 --> 10:43.676
before turning back round.

10:43.776 --> 10:46.779
- You're a madman! You're a madman!

10:46.846 --> 10:49.482
- Say-say, do you-do you mind if I scream?

10:49.548 --> 10:51.450
I sometimes need to scream

10:51.517 --> 10:54.053
right...at this...point.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.222
Ahh-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya--

11:05.164 --> 11:06.065
Ohh...

11:12.171 --> 11:14.073
- Oh my God!

11:15.574 --> 11:17.410
So beautiful. - Yeah.

11:17.510 --> 11:21.414
- So cool. - It's magnificent.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.150
- I've never seen anything like it.

11:24.216 --> 11:27.553
- Oh crap, I'm crying.

11:27.653 --> 11:30.756
I'm crying. I'm crying.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.992
- Told you. I told you.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.663
Oh, no. - What's happening?

11:37.730 --> 11:39.732
What's happening? - No, no, no. Oh God, no.

11:39.832 --> 11:43.269
- Wh-wh-wh-wha-- Say what's wrong!

11:43.369 --> 11:45.771
- Oh God, something is impacting the elevator.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.273
The doors are gonna open.

11:47.373 --> 11:50.443
- What? We're gonna die! We're gonna die!

11:50.543 --> 11:52.545
We're going to die! -

11:52.611 --> 11:55.114
- We're going to meet our souls.

11:55.214 --> 11:56.515
Sorry.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.291
Lunch?

12:05.391 --> 12:08.127
- Where are we? - Is that a restaurant!

12:08.227 --> 12:09.628
- Yes. - There's like...

12:09.729 --> 12:11.530
a whole civilization down here.

12:11.597 --> 12:13.132
- Yes. Yes. That's right.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.267
Two floors down from where you started.

12:15.367 --> 12:18.204
Centrifugal force,

12:18.270 --> 12:20.039
a top notch graphics team,

12:20.106 --> 12:21.640
and a big heater.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.477
I do that for every single guest that I have here.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.978
I had to go to the hospital once

12:26.078 --> 12:27.480
from doing it too many times.

12:27.580 --> 12:31.584
- It wasn't real?

12:31.650 --> 12:33.285
It wasn't real?!

12:33.385 --> 12:36.489
- It feels horrible, right?

12:36.589 --> 12:39.058
Hey, we're gonna send you a zip file with pictures

12:39.125 --> 12:40.426
of all of you in mid-panic.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.261
It was so funny.

12:42.328 --> 12:43.996
- You're a sick fuck.

12:44.096 --> 12:47.566
- But why are you in there?

12:50.269 --> 12:52.071
- I thought we were gonna die.

12:52.138 --> 12:53.672
- I know. I know.

12:53.773 --> 12:57.910
I hope everybody's hungry. I hope you're hungry as bears.

13:01.147 --> 13:02.348
- Portia. Portia. Portia.

13:14.527 --> 13:15.861
- Excuse me.

13:20.032 --> 13:22.034
- I didn't see you there, little guy.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.036
- May I have an ice cream please?

13:24.136 --> 13:27.706
- Oh, I-I'm afraid I do not have that authority.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.375
I-I wouldn't like it

13:29.475 --> 13:32.678
if you couldn't have dairy and got a seizure.

13:32.778 --> 13:35.815
- Please. The truck is right outside.

13:35.881 --> 13:37.716
The song makes me crave it

13:37.817 --> 13:41.187
and it would be a nice and enjoyable relief from the heat.

13:41.287 --> 13:43.989
- I don't want your dads to yell at me, you know?

13:46.358 --> 13:49.061
- All the other children are receiving ice creams.

13:49.161 --> 13:51.630
- I'm sorry, little guy.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.685
- Hey, Portia Davenport,

14:12.751 --> 14:15.354
you're not eating meat right now, right?

14:16.355 --> 14:18.924
- I'm not. How did you know that?

14:19.024 --> 14:21.360
- Well, you know, I invented texting--I know everything.

14:21.427 --> 14:24.230
I already know what everybody wants to eat,

14:24.330 --> 14:26.765
and here it is.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.736
- Oh my God. My favorite fish food.

14:30.836 --> 14:32.571
- What did you get?

14:32.671 --> 14:37.076
- Burger. - Look at that. Look at that.

14:37.176 --> 14:40.512
- So Tunnel, may I ask, um...

14:40.579 --> 14:42.348
how did you change your mind about me?

14:42.414 --> 14:46.018
- You and I have a lot in common, I think.

14:46.085 --> 14:48.420
You know, I mean, you're trying to do something

14:48.520 --> 14:50.189
that nobody's ever done before,

14:50.256 --> 14:52.758
and it's something that's so radical

14:52.858 --> 14:55.394
that it sounds unbelievable.

14:55.461 --> 14:57.463
I thought that it was ludicrous,

14:57.563 --> 15:00.633
but then I came to understand that I was being shortsighted.

15:00.733 --> 15:04.870
After all, I've been called all the same nasty names

15:04.937 --> 15:06.405
that you've been called--

15:06.472 --> 15:09.808
insane, sociopathic, stupid--

15:09.909 --> 15:14.880
but people confuse ambition

15:14.947 --> 15:17.316
for psychopathy.

15:17.416 --> 15:18.751
So maybe you're not crazy.

15:18.817 --> 15:21.954
You're just, uh, inspired?

15:23.289 --> 15:25.591
- I like to think so. - Yes.

15:25.658 --> 15:28.394
Hey, do you know why I put you in that elevator?

15:28.460 --> 15:31.163
all together: No. - Before today, did you believe

15:31.263 --> 15:33.165
it was possible to go to the center of the earth?

15:33.265 --> 15:34.900
- No. - No.

15:34.967 --> 15:36.669
- But today you believed it didn't you?

15:36.769 --> 15:41.006
- I actually, I had a suspicion that it wasn't real.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.609
- All right. If you say so. But I do believe

15:43.676 --> 15:46.111
that with my special effects and da da da,

15:46.178 --> 15:49.748
finally you came around to all believing

15:49.815 --> 15:51.016
that it was true, right?

15:51.116 --> 15:52.751
- Mm-hmm. - True.

15:52.818 --> 15:56.121
But we didn't actually go to the center of the earth.

15:56.188 --> 15:58.824
So...what did you accomplish?

15:58.924 --> 16:03.996
- Well, Dory, maybe now one day we can go

16:04.096 --> 16:06.999
to the center of the earth because we're one step closer

16:07.099 --> 16:09.535
to believing that it's possible.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.370
And to me,

16:11.470 --> 16:15.341
you're the embodiment of possibility and people,

16:15.441 --> 16:18.544
they sure want what you have, I'll tell you that.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.279
- And what do you think I have?

16:20.346 --> 16:23.449
- The belief that you can lead us to a future

16:23.515 --> 16:27.553
where we're no longer tyrannized by our minds.

16:27.653 --> 16:31.724
All beings flowing together,

16:31.824 --> 16:33.892
absolutely in rhythm

16:33.993 --> 16:37.997
with the divine song of the universe.

16:38.063 --> 16:41.233
No more pain.

16:41.333 --> 16:42.568
And you're telling us

16:42.668 --> 16:47.973
that we could have that in our lifetimes.

16:48.040 --> 16:51.176
I mean...wow!

16:54.213 --> 16:55.814
- What is--what?

16:59.351 --> 17:02.254
God, is that--is that Kikei? - It is.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.022
Are you a resident here? - I am.

17:04.089 --> 17:05.924
What happened, Officer? - Drowned.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.760
- But it's only 4 feet of water.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.561
- I've seen it before with pool boys.

17:09.661 --> 17:11.597
They see a dead bee and fixate on it.

17:11.697 --> 17:14.266
Next thing you know, they fall head first against the bottom.

17:14.366 --> 17:17.436
Let this be a lesson to you, huh? Let the bees float.

17:17.536 --> 17:18.937
- I will, Officer.

17:19.038 --> 17:23.442
Well, this is just awful. I employed him.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.110
Oh, Aspen!

17:25.210 --> 17:26.578
Thank you.

17:26.678 --> 17:30.349
Aspen, sweetie. Do not look, okay? Don't look.

17:30.416 --> 17:35.287
- I awoke from a slumber to see him floating like a Lily pad.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.056
- Oh God. - I called the police,

17:37.122 --> 17:38.457
but it was too late.

17:38.557 --> 17:41.693
His lungs were filled with the water.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.863
Does that mean he's...dead?

17:44.930 --> 17:50.135
- He's with Jesus Christ and his angels now. Yes.

17:53.739 --> 17:58.243
- May I have an ice cream because of what I've seen?

17:58.310 --> 18:00.145
- Oh, of course.

18:00.245 --> 18:01.780
Of course you can have an ice cream.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.883
You have been through so much. Ohh!

18:04.950 --> 18:07.753
You're such a good boy.

18:07.820 --> 18:11.056
- What exactly are you proposing?

18:11.123 --> 18:13.659
- Well, Drew Gardner, what I'm proposing

18:13.759 --> 18:18.497
is that we find a way to turn Dory's ideas

18:18.597 --> 18:20.299
into something you can hold on to,

18:20.399 --> 18:24.103
something that could change the course of human history.

18:24.169 --> 18:26.839
Something that's so revolutionary

18:26.939 --> 18:30.008
that people 500 years from now are gonna point back

18:30.109 --> 18:35.814
to this moment right now and say, "They did...that."

18:35.914 --> 18:37.316
- Okay.

18:37.416 --> 18:39.852
And there could be lunch boxes and phone cases

18:39.952 --> 18:41.854
and a whole line of bedding. And--

18:41.954 --> 18:45.190
- So you want to sell enlightenment?

18:45.290 --> 18:48.627
- I wanna invent it, uh, and produce it

18:48.694 --> 18:50.796
and sell it. - I would love to

18:50.863 --> 18:52.664
take something that would like fix me.

18:52.764 --> 18:53.999
- Yes, but who wants to do the work?

18:54.099 --> 18:55.701
All that talking and teaching

18:55.801 --> 18:58.370
and spending 40 days and nights in the jungle.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.805
Nobody wants that.

18:59.872 --> 19:03.475
They want a quick and easy solution.

19:03.542 --> 19:05.377
- They want a pill.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.112
- What'd you say?

19:07.179 --> 19:09.114
- They want a pill.

19:11.550 --> 19:14.486
- That's what it should be.

19:14.553 --> 19:16.288
- I feel like I'm gonna cry and I don't even know why.

19:16.355 --> 19:17.890
- Yeah, but it's a concept.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.826
You can't swallow a concept.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.227
It's just kind of nutty.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.563
I mean, does no one else see this?

19:24.663 --> 19:26.665
- I think maybe you can't see it

19:26.732 --> 19:29.568
because, my darling, you're kind of not feeling involved.

19:29.668 --> 19:32.237
But I sure want you to be involved, 'cause what a story.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.540
Don't you think it would be a great story, you know,

19:34.640 --> 19:38.911
friends who were famously just torn asunder

19:39.011 --> 19:40.512
by their differences

19:40.579 --> 19:43.482
and now reunited by enlightenment

19:43.549 --> 19:46.852
and the fight for the future of humanity.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.320
What do you think of that?

19:48.387 --> 19:51.590
Plus, you know, you would be set for life.

19:51.690 --> 19:54.359
- I, for one, would love to be involved.

19:54.426 --> 19:56.261
- I would love to be involved.

19:56.361 --> 19:59.698
- Mm-hmm. And Dory would you need to think it over?

19:59.765 --> 20:01.099
Where's your head at?

20:01.200 --> 20:03.335
- With all due respect, Tunnel...

20:04.937 --> 20:09.107
I think the one who needs to think it over more is you.

20:12.611 --> 20:14.046
- Why is that?

20:14.112 --> 20:19.384
- Because if we do this and it actually works

20:19.451 --> 20:24.122
and you can really feel what I feel,

20:24.223 --> 20:27.926
then you'll want to give up...

20:28.026 --> 20:30.462
all of this.

20:30.562 --> 20:33.465
This is not something to take lightly.

20:33.565 --> 20:36.235
I don't believe in business,

20:36.301 --> 20:38.136
and even though your ideas are big,

20:38.237 --> 20:41.473
I still very much see you as a businessman.

20:41.573 --> 20:46.545
So...I just don't know if I can trust you yet.

20:46.979 --> 20:49.147
- That's fine. Take your time.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.749
Uh...

20:50.816 --> 20:53.652
you know where to find me.

20:54.586 --> 20:58.957
I'll be right, uh, right here at the center of the earth.

21:00.158 --> 21:01.960
- Would you ever wanna be enlightened?

21:02.060 --> 21:03.895
Like if it came in the form of a pill

21:03.962 --> 21:05.330
and I was in charge of it

21:05.430 --> 21:07.566
and I was also extremely celebrated for that.

21:07.633 --> 21:09.768
- Oh my God.

21:09.835 --> 21:11.270
It's Kikei's puka shells.

21:11.336 --> 21:13.839
- Why would Aspen have those? - I don't know.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.109
Unless--

21:17.175 --> 21:18.176
- Unless what?

21:18.277 --> 21:20.812
- You don't think Aspen...

21:20.912 --> 21:21.947
- Marc!

21:22.014 --> 21:23.315
No!

21:23.415 --> 21:25.517
- Yeah. Right, no.

21:43.201 --> 21:45.370
- He knows how to play Piano.

21:49.641 --> 21:52.210
- Good--good boy. Ha.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.656
- Dory. I really feel like in my cells

22:04.723 --> 22:07.059
that working with Tunnel is the right thing to do.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.527
I really do.

22:08.627 --> 22:10.028
- I just have to be careful

22:10.128 --> 22:12.364
with how I approach it, you know?

22:12.464 --> 22:14.733
There's just something about him.

22:14.833 --> 22:17.536
I don't know if he fully gets it.

22:17.636 --> 22:21.540
- Dory, Dory, Dory. This could be our redemption,

22:21.640 --> 22:24.876
like not just for you, for all of us.

22:24.976 --> 22:27.746
And it's incredible-- we're given this opportunity

22:27.846 --> 22:31.917
where we can actually right the wrongs of our past.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.320
- No matter what happens,

22:35.387 --> 22:38.657
I want you right there by my side, okay?

22:38.724 --> 22:42.227
- Ohh...really? - Yeah.

22:42.327 --> 22:46.198
- It would be such an honor to be right by your side.

22:51.069 --> 22:54.272
Are you--are you and, um, Drew back together?

22:54.373 --> 22:56.007
- Why?

22:57.242 --> 22:59.845
- Just when I saw you guys come in together,

22:59.911 --> 23:03.081
I thought--kind of was like...

23:03.181 --> 23:06.284
maybe sensing a vibe.

23:07.519 --> 23:10.021
- You have nothing to worry about Portia.

23:10.088 --> 23:12.924
Drew loves you so much.

23:17.062 --> 23:19.030
- I'm lost.

23:20.465 --> 23:22.734
I'm a lost soul.

23:22.801 --> 23:25.704
But today at Tunnel's,

23:25.771 --> 23:28.974
with you and your light,

23:29.074 --> 23:34.045
I finally felt for the first time like...

23:34.112 --> 23:36.081
I had the sense of hope.

23:41.319 --> 23:43.288
Can I tell you something?

23:43.388 --> 23:45.257
- Of course.

23:49.428 --> 23:52.297
- I wasn't jealous of you.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.468
I was jealous of Drew.
