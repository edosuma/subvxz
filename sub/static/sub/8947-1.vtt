01:10.800 --> 01:14.100
Listen, here's the thing.

01:14.170 --> 01:19.040
If you can't spot the sucker
in your first half hour at the table,

01:19.110 --> 01:21.370
then you are the sucker.

01:28.920 --> 01:32.290
Guys around here'll tell ya--
you play for a living.

01:32.360 --> 01:36.380
It's like any other job.
You don't gamble. You grind it out.

01:36.460 --> 01:40.730
Your goal is to win
one big bet an hour, that's it.

01:40.800 --> 01:44.060
Get your money in when you have the best
of it, and protect it when you don't.

01:44.130 --> 01:46.120
Don't give anything away.

01:46.200 --> 01:49.040
That's how I've paid my way
through half of law school.

01:49.110 --> 01:52.560
A true grinder.

01:52.640 --> 01:57.580
See, I learned how to win a little at
a time. But finally, I've learned this--

01:57.650 --> 02:02.140
If you're too careful, your
whole life can become a fuckin' grind.

02:10.460 --> 02:14.190
This is Teddy KGB's place.

02:14.260 --> 02:17.860
- Five hundred.
- You won't find it in the Yellow Pages.

02:17.930 --> 02:20.100
Nope.
Not tonight.

02:20.170 --> 02:22.100
No? What?

02:25.840 --> 02:28.310
Give me three stacks
of high society.

02:42.760 --> 02:46.560
Thirty thousand.
Count it.

02:52.200 --> 02:57.610
- That's good.
- So, you're sitting the apple.

02:57.670 --> 03:00.770
- Good. Want a cookie?
- No.

03:02.110 --> 03:04.050
He doesn't look like much,

03:04.110 --> 03:07.810
but KGB is connected all the way
to the top of the Russian mob.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.880
He's the one guy in the game
you don't want to fuck with.

03:10.950 --> 03:13.220
But if you're looking
for high stakes,

03:13.290 --> 03:15.280
this is the only place
in town.

03:15.360 --> 03:18.950
They all know me as a small-timer,
but that's about to change.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.730
Joey Knish
is a New York legend.

03:28.810 --> 03:31.600
He's been a rounder,
earning his living at cards...

03:31.670 --> 03:34.270
since he was 19 years old.

03:34.340 --> 03:36.780
What are you,
holdin' those for somebody?

03:36.850 --> 03:40.210
Uh, yeah,
I'm holding 'em for you.

03:40.280 --> 03:42.250
You should be.

03:42.320 --> 03:45.120
'Cause I hope you're not thinking
of putting all that glimmer in play.

03:45.190 --> 03:48.490
He's as close to a friend
as there is in this place.

03:48.560 --> 03:51.460
Come here.
- But tonight, I don't want to see him.

03:51.530 --> 03:53.790
Now, you don't wanna
butt onions with these guys.

03:53.860 --> 03:56.990
'Cause they'll chew you up,
take your whole bankroll.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.870
- So you say.
- There's plenty of easy games.

04:00.940 --> 04:04.170
We get outta here, get some coffee,
ride over to that soft seat in Queens.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.640
I know what I'm doing.

04:08.950 --> 04:11.710
You're making a run at it,
aren't you?

04:11.780 --> 04:14.340
Rolling up a stake
and going to Vegas.

04:14.420 --> 04:17.910
I'm right, right?

04:17.990 --> 04:20.149
- I can beat the game.
- Maybe.

04:20.220 --> 04:22.710
Maybe this is a game
can be beat.

04:22.790 --> 04:25.590
But you know you can beat the 10-20
at the Chesterfield and the Hi-Low...

04:25.660 --> 04:28.060
at that goulash joint
on 79th Street.

04:29.630 --> 04:33.400
Okay.
I understand.

04:35.610 --> 04:39.300
I understand.
Back to battle.

04:42.180 --> 04:45.050
The game in question is
No-Limit Texas Hold 'Em.

04:45.110 --> 04:47.840
Minimum buy-in $25,000.

04:47.920 --> 04:51.280
A game like this doesn't come together
often outside the casinos.

04:51.350 --> 04:53.480
The stakes attract
rich flounders,

04:53.560 --> 04:55.990
and they in turn
attract the sharks.

05:00.630 --> 05:04.330
No-Limit Texas Hold 'Em
is the Cadillac of poker.

05:04.400 --> 05:07.840
Each player is dealt
two cards face down.

05:07.900 --> 05:11.070
Five cards are then dealt
face up across the middle.

05:11.140 --> 05:14.600
These are community cards everyone can
use to make the best five card hand.

05:16.180 --> 05:19.050
The key to the game is playing
the man, not the cards.

05:19.120 --> 05:21.550
Bet an eight ball.

05:23.720 --> 05:27.850
There's no other game in which fortunes
can change so much from hand to hand.

05:27.920 --> 05:31.120
A brilliant player can get
a strong hand cracked, go on tilt...

05:31.190 --> 05:34.160
and lose his mind along with
every single chip in front of him.

05:34.230 --> 05:38.360
This is why the World Series of Poker is
decided over a No-Limit Hold 'Em table.

05:38.430 --> 05:41.100
Some people, pros even,
won't play No-Limit.

05:41.170 --> 05:43.470
They can't handle
the swings.

05:44.840 --> 05:47.240
But there are others,
like Doyle Brunson,

05:47.310 --> 05:50.370
who consider No-Limit
the only pure game left.

05:52.480 --> 05:58.040
Like Papa Wallenda said-- "Life is on
the wire. The rest is just waiting."

05:58.120 --> 06:00.590
Pass it to you.

06:03.590 --> 06:06.030
All right, I raise.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.930
- I'm gonna raise five hundred.
- Fold.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.430
It's a position raise.
I call it.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.740
Here's the beauty of this game.

06:23.480 --> 06:26.740
Go ahead.
- I just got top two pair on the flop,

06:26.820 --> 06:28.780
and I want to keep him
in the hand.

06:28.850 --> 06:32.250
Against your average guy,
I'd set a bear trap, hardly bet at all.

06:32.320 --> 06:35.310
Let him walk into it.
But KGB's too smart for that.

06:35.390 --> 06:38.220
So, what I've got to do
is over-bet the pot,

06:38.290 --> 06:40.390
make it look like
I'm trying to buy it.

06:40.460 --> 06:41.299
I bet $2,000.

06:41.599 --> 06:44.760
Then he plays back at
me, and I get paid off.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.630
Call.

07:18.700 --> 07:21.970
My guess is Teddy's on a flush draw.

07:23.640 --> 07:25.630
Burn and turn.

07:27.410 --> 07:29.380
There's my money card, nine of hearts.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.470
I got a full house.

07:33.550 --> 07:35.880
- To the bettor.
- Check's good.

07:35.950 --> 07:39.720
Now I hope
a spade falls and Teddy makes his flush.

07:39.790 --> 07:43.820
That way he'll bet strong, and I'll beat
him with my nines full over aces.

07:49.070 --> 07:52.730
I'm going to bet--

07:52.800 --> 07:56.240
Bet...

07:56.310 --> 07:59.330
$15,000.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.910
Time.

08:06.850 --> 08:09.680
I want him to think
that I'm pondering a call,

08:09.750 --> 08:13.620
but all I'm really thinking about
is Vegas and the fucking Mirage.

08:28.650 --> 08:32.640
All right, your 15, plus
I have another 33 to raise you.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.650
Um--

08:38.820 --> 08:42.490
Yeah, I'm gonna go all in, 'cause
I don't think you got the spades.

08:45.800 --> 08:50.130
You are right.
I don't have spades.

08:55.370 --> 08:58.430
I know before
the cards are even turned over.

09:02.580 --> 09:05.680
Aces full, Mike.

09:35.050 --> 09:36.980
Get up.

09:39.990 --> 09:41.920
Come on.
Come on.

09:46.760 --> 09:49.850
- Want some?
- No.

09:49.930 --> 09:53.090
I'm down to the felt, Knish.
I lost everything.

09:53.170 --> 09:57.330
Man, I lost my case money.
I lost my tuition.

09:58.900 --> 10:02.500
It happens to everyone.
Time to time, everyone goes bust.

10:02.580 --> 10:05.640
You'll be back in the game
before you know it.

10:05.710 --> 10:08.770
I'm done.
I'm out of it.

10:08.850 --> 10:11.340
They all say that
at first.

10:11.420 --> 10:14.580
Hey, man, let me stake you.
Standard deal, you know.

10:14.650 --> 10:18.920
Fifty percent of your winnings.
If you lose, it's on me.

10:20.690 --> 10:22.890
I'd just throw it away.

10:25.970 --> 10:29.420
- You still got the truck?
- Sure.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.440
Come on.

10:45.920 --> 10:49.880
You don't hear much
about guys who take their shot and miss,

10:49.960 --> 10:52.220
but I'll tell you
what happens to 'em.

10:52.290 --> 10:55.160
They end up humping crappy jobs
on graveyard shifts,

10:55.230 --> 10:58.250
trying to figure out
how they came up short.

10:59.800 --> 11:01.990
See, I had this picture
in my head.

11:02.070 --> 11:05.060
Me sitting at the big table,
Doyle to my left,

11:05.140 --> 11:09.630
Amarillo Slim to my right,
playing in the World Series of Poker.

11:09.710 --> 11:14.040
And I let that vision
blind me at the table against KGB.

11:14.110 --> 11:16.950
Now, the closest I get
to Vegas is west New York,

11:17.020 --> 11:19.580
driving this lousy route
handed down from Knish...

11:19.650 --> 11:22.950
to rounders who forget
the cardinal fuckin' rule--

11:23.020 --> 11:24.990
Always leave yourself outs.

11:25.060 --> 11:27.550
- Hey, Moogie.
- Let me ask you a question.

11:27.630 --> 11:31.120
In a legal sense, can fuckin'
Steinbrenner just move the Yankees?

11:31.200 --> 11:33.830
Does he have the fuckin' right
to just move them?

11:33.900 --> 11:36.630
I don't know.
How should I know that?

11:36.700 --> 11:37.769
You didn't learn that yet?

11:38.069 --> 11:40.660
No, we get to Steinbrenner
in the third year of law school.

11:40.740 --> 11:43.500
Oh.

11:43.580 --> 11:47.770
- Take care, man.
- Yeah.

11:59.730 --> 12:01.630
The judges' game.

12:01.690 --> 12:05.820
I'd heard about it for years on the
street, before I was even in law school.

12:05.900 --> 12:09.530
A rotating group of ten or twelve
judges, prosecutors and professors.

12:09.600 --> 12:12.040
They all have money,
and in my playing days...

12:12.100 --> 12:15.560
it would have been pretty sweet to have
any one of them owing me favors.

12:15.640 --> 12:18.200
Only problem is, no one
can get in the game anymore.

12:18.280 --> 12:22.300
One rounder, Crispy Linetta,
sat under some pretense,

12:22.380 --> 12:26.880
but they found out he was a pro, he couldn't
cross the street without a legal hassle.

12:26.950 --> 12:29.820
Even his regular club,
Vorshay's, got shut down.

12:29.890 --> 12:32.820
Place had been open
since 1907.

12:32.890 --> 12:34.790
Oh, Michael.

12:34.860 --> 12:37.520
- You got some things for me?
- Yes, I do.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.930
Put 'em on the desk,
it's all right.

12:41.330 --> 12:43.300
Kid, he paying you
for this late night shit?

12:43.370 --> 12:46.740
Oh, well, knowledge is
my reward, sir.

12:46.810 --> 12:49.170
Let me tell you, it ain't worth it.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.540
Why don't you become a jockey,
do something useful.

12:51.610 --> 12:54.370
Kid's a little tall, isn't he, Gene?

12:54.450 --> 12:57.420
Enough with the Belmont
recruiting spiel. Your bet.

12:57.480 --> 12:59.750
- All right. I call.
- Michael is lead counsel...

12:59.820 --> 13:02.150
in the Moot Court
you're presiding over next week, Gene.

13:02.220 --> 13:04.350
Besides, he could use
the background if heâ€™s gonna...

13:04.420 --> 13:07.480
clerk for one of you fellas
this summer, right?

13:07.560 --> 13:11.660
Abe, I thought you liked the kid. Why do
you want to make him a civil servant?

13:11.730 --> 13:15.130
Yeah, look-- a word to the wise.
Stay in the private sector.

13:15.200 --> 13:19.160
That Nassau defense attorney's game?
They use our chips for coasters.

13:19.240 --> 13:21.600
The amazing thing is, in this
collection of great legal minds,

13:21.670 --> 13:24.440
there isn't a single
real card player.

13:24.510 --> 13:28.040
- I call.
- Raise.

13:28.110 --> 13:30.240
Um, the professor raises.

13:32.180 --> 13:35.550
Mike?
Michael, I would have just called.

13:35.620 --> 13:37.560
No, you're good.

13:37.620 --> 13:40.420
All right, I call.

13:40.490 --> 13:43.050
I don't know if I'm going to bring
my legal career to a crashing halt...

13:43.130 --> 13:47.330
before it even starts,
but I just can't help myself.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.370
- Good.
- I'm in.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.770
Read 'em and weep.

13:55.540 --> 13:57.980
Threes check.

14:02.650 --> 14:05.640
Check to Martin and Lewis
over there.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.710
- Check to the raiser.
- Czechoslovakia.

14:08.790 --> 14:13.050
- What's the limit?
- $20. Big bet's $20.

14:13.130 --> 14:17.220
Okay. Good.
There's $20.

14:17.300 --> 14:21.490
You've seen half a hand. How the
fuck are you betting into us?

14:21.570 --> 14:24.160
You sure this is wise, Abe?
It's your money the kid's bettin' with.

14:24.240 --> 14:28.610
It's plenty wise. We know what we're
holding, and we know what you're holding.

14:28.670 --> 14:31.400
The fuck you know what we all got.

14:31.480 --> 14:34.410
Summer clerkship in your office says
I know what you're holding.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.970
I don't bet
with jobs like that.

14:37.050 --> 14:40.420
Let's just say I'll put you at the top
of the list if you're right.

14:40.490 --> 14:44.420
Okay. Well, you
were looking for that third three,

14:44.490 --> 14:47.360
but you forgot that Professor Green
folded it on Fourth Street,

14:47.430 --> 14:49.590
and now you're representing
that you have it.

14:49.660 --> 14:52.100
The D.A. made his two pair,
but he knows they're no good.

14:52.160 --> 14:55.790
Judge Kaplan was trying to squeeze out
a diamond flush, but he came up short,

14:55.870 --> 14:58.270
and Mr. Eisen is futilely hoping
that his queens are gonna stand up.

14:58.340 --> 15:01.670
So, like I said,
the Dean's bet is $20.

15:01.740 --> 15:04.680
- Well, kiss my ass.
- Kiss my ass.

15:08.480 --> 15:11.510
- What'd you have, Abe?
- Nothin' but a busted straight.

15:11.580 --> 15:14.140
- Oh, come on.
- It's good enough to win. Take it down.

15:14.220 --> 15:17.710
All right, kid, your first assignment.
Pull up a seat next to me.

15:17.790 --> 15:20.380
Oh, I'd like to. I can't, I can't.
I don't play cards.

15:20.460 --> 15:24.050
- Get outta here!
- See you tomorrow.

15:24.130 --> 15:26.460
- Whose deal?
- My deal.

15:26.530 --> 15:29.310
- I like the kid, Abe.
- Good kid.

15:29.380 --> 15:31.680
Smart kid.

15:31.780 --> 15:35.220
I tell ya, it's hard leaving that game.

15:35.280 --> 15:38.810
An open invitation
to lay with those lambs.

15:38.890 --> 15:40.820
But I'm retired.

15:43.290 --> 15:46.020
The truth is, I can always
find games, though.

15:46.090 --> 15:50.000
Easy games, tough games, straight games,
crooked games, home games.

15:50.070 --> 15:54.230
I can turn this truck onto the Jersey
Turnpike and be at the Taj in two hours.

15:55.670 --> 15:57.610
But I've made promises.

16:00.780 --> 16:03.210
I'm just a law student now.

16:04.950 --> 16:06.880
Hello?

16:06.950 --> 16:08.880
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:10.490 --> 16:13.280
- How'd it go?
- Oh, great.

16:17.530 --> 16:21.830
I am sick of that fucking route.

16:21.900 --> 16:24.830
Don't worry.
A few more semesters--

16:24.900 --> 16:27.960
Mmm.

16:28.040 --> 16:30.470
Oh, I gotta go.

16:30.540 --> 16:33.800
- I'm really late.
- Oh, just stay here. I'll be really quick.

16:33.880 --> 16:36.500
You won't feel a thing.

16:36.580 --> 16:38.910
We both know
that's not true.

16:38.980 --> 16:41.680
Besides, you should
get some sleep.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.910
These fuckin' long nights
are killing me.

16:43.990 --> 16:45.950
They never used to.

16:46.020 --> 16:48.050
Yeah, well, that's different.
I mean, that was like...

16:48.120 --> 16:50.820
buy in at 8:00, next thing
you know it's morning.

16:50.890 --> 16:53.990
But hey, you know, I think
I'm hooked up for this summer.

16:54.060 --> 16:56.120
Hooked up how?

16:56.200 --> 16:59.960
Well, after I left you last night at the
library, I impressed Judge Marinacci.

17:00.040 --> 17:02.160
I think I might be in line
for a clerkship.

17:03.640 --> 17:06.369
Tell me more.

17:06.440 --> 17:09.500
Well, those guys were
all playing cards, and--

17:09.579 --> 17:12.210
Just hear me out now,
hear me out.

17:12.280 --> 17:15.220
They were playing cards
and I read his hand blind.

17:18.150 --> 17:21.589
So, instead of coming home, you went
and played cards with some judge?

17:21.660 --> 17:24.680
No, I wasn't even playing.
They were playing.

17:27.300 --> 17:29.290
I just caught his eye
by reading his hand, that's all.

17:29.360 --> 17:33.160
I mean, as long as I don't fuck
up Moot Court, I think the job's mine.

17:35.640 --> 17:38.230
What kind of job
is that gonna be, Mike?

17:38.310 --> 17:40.830
Writing an opinion
on high-stakes poker?

17:40.910 --> 17:43.470
Honey, you're the one
who told me...

17:43.550 --> 17:46.140
that I should use my poker skills
in the courtroom.

17:46.210 --> 17:48.610
Yeah, I know
I said that, but--

17:48.680 --> 17:51.880
You know what I meant.
I meant that you should use your head.

17:51.950 --> 17:56.120
You know, the way you calculate odds
on the spot, the way you read people.

17:56.190 --> 17:58.035
That's what I meant.
I didn't mean that you

17:58.335 --> 18:00.180
should try to con your
way into a summer job.

18:00.260 --> 18:04.560
- Honey, con? I was networking.
- Oh, God.

18:04.630 --> 18:08.130
Networking. Are you trying
to con me now?

18:08.200 --> 18:10.970
No.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.600
I just--
I don't think you get it.

18:13.680 --> 18:17.240
You'll be just like one
of those ex-college athletes.

18:17.310 --> 18:19.910
You know, great job at the
D.A.'s office as long as...

18:19.980 --> 18:22.820
they never miss
a lawyer's league game.

18:22.880 --> 18:26.320
It's true. I just think if you
get in this way,

18:26.390 --> 18:28.550
you'll always be
a hustler to them.

18:28.620 --> 18:30.620
Baby, I didn't even play.

18:32.690 --> 18:35.490
Okay.

18:35.560 --> 18:37.560
I'll see you later.

18:44.770 --> 18:46.710
Oh.

18:46.810 --> 18:51.210
- Hey, hon, can I take the Jeep tomorrow?
- Yeah, where?

18:51.280 --> 18:54.080
Uh, Worm's gettin' out.
I was gonna pick him up.

18:54.150 --> 18:56.710
Tomorrow.
Beautiful.

18:56.790 --> 18:58.720
I promised
I'd be there, hon.

18:58.790 --> 19:02.550
Worm. I just can't believe you
still know someone called "Worm."

19:02.620 --> 19:04.590
He's like my brother.

19:06.900 --> 19:08.830
Shit.
I didn't even play.

19:10.900 --> 19:14.930
I met Worm at Dwight Inglewood
Preparatory Academy over in Jersey.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.900
We were the only two kids attending
who didn't have a trust fund.

19:17.970 --> 19:21.140
My father's office was there.
It said "Custodian"on the door.

19:21.210 --> 19:23.730
That's why
they took me.

19:26.620 --> 19:30.050
Pow!

19:32.420 --> 19:35.750
W-Was that, like,
your strong finish or something?

19:35.820 --> 19:38.660
- Motherfucker!
- You leave me no choice, the way you play.

19:38.730 --> 19:41.490
That's the fourth time you done
played that bitch of spades on my ass.

19:41.560 --> 19:43.960
No, no, no, no, no.

19:44.030 --> 19:47.090
Dowling had it three hands ago, and
two hands ago I got the black Maria,

19:47.170 --> 19:49.100
so I don't want to
hear you bitchin', okay?

19:49.170 --> 19:50.954
Yeah, but he shot the
moon on that hand, didn't he?

19:51.254 --> 19:51.940
Yeah, I saw that.

19:52.010 --> 19:56.170
- So it helped you.
- Now-- Okay, you're right.

19:56.240 --> 19:58.800
You ain't walking outta here
with our grits, Worm.

19:58.880 --> 20:02.340
You know the drill, okay? I'm not
gonna smoke 'em. I'll hold on to 'em.

20:02.420 --> 20:04.270
if you want 'em back,
you can trade me for 'em,

20:04.570 --> 20:06.150
or try to play
double or nothing tomorrow.

20:06.220 --> 20:10.160
Murphy! What the hell you sittin'
there for? You're processed. Come on.

20:12.230 --> 20:15.860
Processed? This motherfucker's
gettin' the jump.

20:15.930 --> 20:18.230
Come on, man, have
some decency here, Worm.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.230
You can buy all the smokes
you want in half an hour.

20:20.300 --> 20:22.508
What are you talking about?
I won these fair and square.

20:22.808 --> 20:23.970
You don't even smoke, Worm.

20:24.040 --> 20:27.870
Jesus, you guys are such
fuckin' babies. You know that?

20:27.940 --> 20:31.850
If you're determined to die of cancer,
you really oughta learn how to play cards.

20:31.910 --> 20:34.110
Ain't a good idea to add
insult to injury, yo.

20:34.180 --> 20:36.780
- That shit will come back and hurt you.
- You know what?

20:36.850 --> 20:39.790
Not in this lifetime.
Enjoy your time.

20:41.890 --> 20:44.380
Murphy.

20:44.460 --> 20:47.390
Worm's dad did the grounds,
when he wasn't too fuckin' drunk.

20:47.460 --> 20:49.490
That's when we did 'em.

20:49.560 --> 20:51.760
Of course, the grounds
weren't all we did.

20:51.830 --> 20:55.830
Worm put us into a scam a day on all the
young aristocrats we went to school with--

20:55.900 --> 21:00.640
selling 'em dime bags of oregano,
nunchakus and firecrackers from Chinatown.

21:00.710 --> 21:03.340
- Where's the rest?
- Kept us in lunch money.

21:08.250 --> 21:10.180
- Thank you.
- Until the time we went for...

21:10.250 --> 21:13.050
more than just pocket change
and got caught.

21:13.120 --> 21:16.580
We had the starting five take a dive
against Friends Academy.

21:16.660 --> 21:20.390
The point guard snapped
and gave Worm up.

21:25.070 --> 21:28.230
They hauled him up before
the school board, offered him a deal.

21:28.300 --> 21:31.360
Tell us who else was involved,
and we'll go easy on you.

21:31.440 --> 21:34.900
Worm didn't say a fuckin' word.
Got himself expelled.

21:37.350 --> 21:40.180
- I stayed in school and graduated.
- Crank the outside.

21:43.950 --> 21:47.440
Not many guys would stand up
for a friend like that.

21:56.770 --> 21:59.730
Ta-da!

21:59.800 --> 22:02.400
- Mike McD. God. I knew you'd be here.
- Aw, man.

22:02.470 --> 22:03.204
You never let me down.

22:03.504 --> 22:05.440
I would have been there
every week if you let me, man.

22:05.510 --> 22:08.480
I know, I know. I couldn't
let you see me in this shit hole.

22:08.540 --> 22:11.100
- Look at you. You look great, man.
- You too, you too.

22:11.180 --> 22:13.340
- Did they toughen you up in there?
- No, no.

22:13.420 --> 22:15.470
It was a piece of cake.
Piece of cake.

22:15.550 --> 22:19.010
Man, look at your ride. You've been
prospering while I've been away.

22:19.090 --> 22:21.560
- What have you been up to?
- I borrowed it.

22:21.620 --> 22:26.150
Whatever.Just get in it and
drive me far away from here.

22:28.030 --> 22:30.790
There's like two whole economies in
there-- there's cash and there's trade.

22:30.870 --> 22:32.990
So I gotta keep three games
going at once, all right?

22:33.070 --> 22:36.610
A game with the white guys, a game with
the brothers, and a game with the guards.

22:36.680 --> 22:39.740
And the trick is, I gotta take
enough cash off the white guys...

22:39.820 --> 22:43.550
to lose it to the guards so that
they keep doing me favors and shit,

22:43.620 --> 22:47.650
but I gotta trim enough smokes off the black
guys that I can trade and keep myself...

22:47.730 --> 22:49.836
in the style that I've
grown accustomed to,

22:50.136 --> 22:52.290
and all of this without
getting my ass kicked.

22:52.360 --> 22:54.360
So you're working
with a partner?

22:54.430 --> 22:56.420
No. Who the hell
am I gonna trust in there?

22:56.500 --> 22:58.590
- It's just me all alone.
- What's this? Come here.

22:58.670 --> 23:01.200
- You like that? Isn't that beautiful?
- What is that?

23:01.270 --> 23:04.110
It's like an ace up my sleeve.
What else?

23:04.180 --> 23:07.010
Wait till I show you some of my chops,
man. I've gotten pretty blinding.

23:07.080 --> 23:09.810
- It's like, it's like, you know--
- All right.

23:09.880 --> 23:11.820
It's gonna blow your mind,
blow your mind.

23:11.880 --> 23:14.510
You been working?
Is your game sharp?

23:14.590 --> 23:16.550
No, man,
I'm off it.

23:16.620 --> 23:18.850
What, are you--
you gettin' cold cards?

23:18.920 --> 23:21.450
No, man,
I mean I quit.

23:21.530 --> 23:25.590
- What, are you shitting me?
- No, man, I--

23:25.660 --> 23:29.570
- I got cleaned out.
- Mike McD? You lost?

23:29.630 --> 23:33.730
Yeah, man, I-- It was a real
blood game over at KGB's place.

23:33.810 --> 23:36.740
You sat down with the Mad Russian
and he emptied your pockets?

23:36.810 --> 23:39.570
Yeah. I didn't want to tell you
while you were in there.

23:39.640 --> 23:42.240
I didn't want to
dispirit you like that.

23:42.310 --> 23:45.040
Jesus, what were you thinking?
So, you're just a student now?

23:45.120 --> 23:48.240
- What are you doing for money?
- I'm driving Knish's truck.

23:48.320 --> 23:52.150
Oh, God, you're killin' me. Mike, Mike,
we gotta get you back on the game.

23:52.220 --> 23:54.490
- The old partners here, we're gonna
run like-- - No, no, no, I'm off it.

23:54.560 --> 23:57.190
I mean, I really am. Done.

23:57.260 --> 24:00.660
You are, huh? All right. I know a game
perfect for the two of us.

24:00.730 --> 24:04.030
It's a berry patch right outside
New York City-- prime pickings.

24:04.100 --> 24:08.940
- I'll drop you-- I'll drop you off.
- Okay.

24:09.010 --> 24:11.910
- I mean it. No, I'm really off it.
- I know, I know.

24:21.050 --> 24:23.040
This is it,
this is it.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.720
So get this, here's the plan.
I know this girl Barbara.

24:25.790 --> 24:30.420
She's fuckin' hot. I was this close
to bangin' her when they sent me away.

24:30.500 --> 24:33.930
She works as a hostess for all these
fuckin' trust fund babies in here.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.930
She got me into
their little game.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.181
She introduced me as her
cousin from out of town

24:38.481 --> 24:40.440
who loves to gamble but
wants to learn poker.

24:40.510 --> 24:42.440
That sounds solid.
That's a nice hookup.

24:42.510 --> 24:46.440
It's all the way nice. There's only
one problem. I got this feeling.

24:46.510 --> 24:51.070
- What feeling is that, exactly?
- You know this feeling very well.

24:51.150 --> 24:53.170
- You know, when you got
your table all set. - Uh-huh.

24:53.250 --> 24:56.520
- Knife, fork, sauce,
A-1, Luger's, but-- - Yeah.

24:56.590 --> 25:00.080
- You just don't have the stake.
- Exactly. Glad you understand.

25:00.160 --> 25:02.820
A nickel would start me
very nicely.

25:02.890 --> 25:05.360
Whoa, Jesus, what have you
been livin' on?

25:05.430 --> 25:08.130
I'm livin' a little light,
I told you.

25:08.200 --> 25:12.140
- Anyway, that's $220, so that'll
get you started. - $220, I mean--

25:12.200 --> 25:16.260
Hey, thanks, but I mean,
that's, like, 11 bets.

25:16.340 --> 25:18.780
I mean, I can't
even get a table on this--

25:18.840 --> 25:21.740
Good, so forget this game. I'll
straighten you out in the city tomorrow.

25:21.810 --> 25:24.480
No way. I gotta get started.

25:24.550 --> 25:26.540
I mean, I'm already
behind here.

25:26.620 --> 25:29.050
You just got out.
What's the big fuckin' hurry?

25:29.120 --> 25:31.520
The hurry is, other than you,
my friend, there's about five guys,

25:31.590 --> 25:35.120
like, eagerly awaiting
my release.

25:35.190 --> 25:37.680
- How much do you owe?
- Like, ten.

25:37.760 --> 25:41.720
- Ten?
- I can't even figure it with the juice.

25:41.800 --> 25:45.930
Hey, look, I can get started on this
easy if it's you and me working together.

25:47.670 --> 25:50.800
I heard you asking before, and I hear
you asking now, but I can't do that.

25:50.880 --> 25:54.040
I just can't do that.
I've made promises.

25:54.110 --> 25:57.310
Hey, you know what? What am I saying?
I totally understand, I do.

25:57.380 --> 26:01.550
It's fine. I'll make a couple of moves
earlier than I would have normally--

26:01.620 --> 26:04.820
- But thanks, I appreciate it.
- Premium hands.

26:04.890 --> 26:09.790
- I'll catch you in the city tomorrow?
- Yeah.

26:09.860 --> 26:12.830
Hey, Mike, man.
Fuckin' great to see ya.

26:12.900 --> 26:14.990
You too.

26:57.610 --> 27:00.410
In Confessions of
a Winning Poker Player, Jack King said,

27:00.480 --> 27:03.810
"Few players recall big pots
they have won, strange as it seems,

27:03.880 --> 27:06.540
"but every player can remember
with remarkable accuracy...

27:06.620 --> 27:09.520
the outstanding tough beats
of his career."

27:09.590 --> 27:11.580
Seems true to me.
'Cause walking in here,

27:11.660 --> 27:13.920
I can hardly remember
how I built my bankroll,

27:13.990 --> 27:17.050
but I can't stop thinking
of how I lost it.

27:17.130 --> 27:19.100
Mike.

27:19.160 --> 27:19.335
Hi.

27:19.635 --> 27:22.790
Barbara. Worm said you'd
be running a little late.

27:22.870 --> 27:25.030
Just follow me.

27:30.780 --> 27:34.440
I probably won't even sit.
You know, just kinda keep him company.

27:34.510 --> 27:36.640
No, no, that's
not gonna work.

27:36.710 --> 27:40.410
Here's the play-- you're my new boyfriend,
you're looking for a regular game.

27:40.490 --> 27:43.550
Really? Well, I'm not
much of a card player.

27:43.620 --> 27:47.890
Bullshit. Worm tells me that's
precisely what you are.

27:50.500 --> 27:53.830
My cut is 25 per cent.

27:53.900 --> 27:57.300
- I see.
- Good. Come on.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.580
Gentlemen.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.840
- This is my boyfriend Michael.
- Hello, Michael.

28:09.010 --> 28:10.950
Be nice to him.

28:11.020 --> 28:14.080
Leave him enough money
to buy me breakfast.

28:14.150 --> 28:16.090
- Good luck.
- Thanks, sweetie.

28:16.150 --> 28:18.320
Here, why don't you
pull up a chair.

28:19.960 --> 28:23.450
- Okay, this one's Chicago.
- You know Chicago?

28:23.530 --> 28:25.590
- Uh, remind me.
- Stud game.

28:25.660 --> 28:27.820
High spade in the hole
wins half the pot.

28:27.900 --> 28:31.030
Okay, well,
deal me in, I guess.

28:34.040 --> 28:35.970
- That's you.
- Oh, thanks.

28:37.540 --> 28:40.310
Okay.

28:42.180 --> 28:44.270
- That's two on you, Murph.
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

28:47.450 --> 28:50.290
- I'm in.
- I'm gonna make it five.

28:50.360 --> 28:53.120
Hey, big spender.

28:53.190 --> 28:57.290
Worm and I fall into our old rhythm
like Clyde Frazier and Pearl Monroe.

28:57.360 --> 29:01.230
We bring out all the old school tricks,
stuff that would never play in the city--

29:01.300 --> 29:03.390
signalling, chip placing,
trapping.

29:03.470 --> 29:05.940
- We even run the old best hand play.
- Raise.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.700
I can probably crack the game
just as quickly straight up,

29:08.770 --> 29:11.070
but there's no risk
in this room.

29:11.140 --> 29:15.170
Now, some people might look down on
Worm's mechanics, call it immoral.

29:15.250 --> 29:19.580
But as Canada Bill Jones said, "It's
immoral to let a sucker keep his money."

29:19.650 --> 29:22.680
Like they teach you
in One-L--

29:22.750 --> 29:25.310
caveat emptor, pal.

29:25.390 --> 29:29.350
I got the boat, queens over.

29:29.430 --> 29:33.590
He asked you if that stung, Birch.

29:33.670 --> 29:36.030
Worm really has become an artist, too.

29:36.100 --> 29:39.330
Discard culls, pickup culls,
overhand run ups, the Double Duke--

29:39.400 --> 29:43.400
His technique is flawless.
But his judgment is a little off.

29:43.470 --> 29:45.950
A few times, I have to fold the case
on him, just so it won't be obvious.

29:48.360 --> 29:52.380
Still, he plays the part
of the loser to perfection.

29:52.460 --> 29:54.590
Flush.

29:54.660 --> 29:57.220
I got the full house.
I got the queens over the aces.

29:57.300 --> 29:59.930
Ahh, fuck!
You know what?

30:00.000 --> 30:04.030
- Fuck you and your never-ending
string of boats, okay? - Hey.

30:07.380 --> 30:10.340
Well, my Uncle Les says when the
money's gone, it's time to move on,

30:10.410 --> 30:14.210
so enjoy it,
you secret handshaking assholes.

30:16.250 --> 30:20.650
Murph! Hey, come back any time.
Your money's always good here.

30:20.720 --> 30:24.680
Good night, Mike. See you next time.

30:24.760 --> 30:27.280
You guys, uh,
wanna keep playing?

30:41.510 --> 30:44.480
How'd we do?
Oh, beautiful.

30:44.550 --> 30:46.710
Fuckin' assholes,
they deserved it.

30:46.780 --> 30:48.770
All right, $300,
that's your cut.

30:48.850 --> 30:51.340
- Thank you very much, boys.
- Hey, you were great. Great.

30:51.420 --> 30:54.550
- When can we do this again?
- No, no, it was a one-time thing for me.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.820
- Just because.
- Forget it.

30:56.890 --> 30:59.950
- Uh, two weeks.
- Two weeks? Okay. Okay.

31:00.030 --> 31:04.020
Hey, thanks a lot. Yeah.

31:04.100 --> 31:06.190
Hey, I had to try, right?

31:06.270 --> 31:08.260
Bye.

31:08.340 --> 31:10.330
Hey, how'd you know
I was coming back?

31:10.410 --> 31:13.310
That's easy.
Who's your favorite actor?

31:13.370 --> 31:17.210
Clint Eastwood. The Outlaw Josey Wales,
man. The Man with No Name.

31:17.280 --> 31:19.340
He always doubles back
for a friend.

31:20.750 --> 31:23.180
Hey, we made good time.
Wanna get breakfast?

31:23.250 --> 31:26.780
No, I gotta get home. If she
hasn't already changed the locks on me.

31:26.850 --> 31:29.150
Just do me a favor.
Give me five minutes.

31:29.220 --> 31:31.380
Get me
straightened out.

31:35.630 --> 31:38.960
This may not look like Teddy's place,
but it ain't the Ivy Leagues either.

31:39.030 --> 31:41.560
So don't fuck around.
You gotta play on your belly.

31:41.640 --> 31:43.730
All right.
No problem.

31:49.140 --> 31:51.510
Hey, you know I have no problem
with the way you help yourself,

31:51.580 --> 31:54.140
but these guys
are fast company.

31:54.220 --> 31:56.410
- They'll spot every move.
- Tough customers, huh?

31:56.480 --> 31:58.480
- Yeah. I'm serious.
- All right.

31:58.550 --> 32:00.520
- You won't just get a finger up your spine.
- Okay, I hear ya.

32:00.590 --> 32:02.750
I'm playing straight.

32:12.770 --> 32:15.790
Michael McDermott.

32:15.870 --> 32:18.000
- How you doin', Mikey?
- Good, how you doin'?

32:18.070 --> 32:20.470
Good. You know, um,

32:20.540 --> 32:22.530
the computer tried
to delete you last week.

32:22.610 --> 32:24.540
- Oh, yeah?
- But I knew you'd be back.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.910
Oh, no, I'm not back,
I just--

32:26.980 --> 32:29.350
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

32:29.420 --> 32:32.350
Um, this is Les Murphy.
He's like my brother.

32:32.420 --> 32:34.390
Call me Worm.

32:34.460 --> 32:38.290
Hey. Don't wiggle away.

32:38.360 --> 32:40.950
Hey, what's she
wearing the button for?

32:41.030 --> 32:43.960
They're wired right into the precinct.
They got 'em on the payroll.

32:49.640 --> 32:52.770
- What are they playing?
- Uh, 20-40 forced rotation.

32:52.840 --> 32:55.570
It's the only game going
right now.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.310
Is that Fat Greggie sitting 20-40?
The game's that soft?

32:58.380 --> 33:02.840
Yeah. It's a real live game.
So, you guys gonna play?

33:02.920 --> 33:04.850
- No.
- Hell, yeah, I'm gonna play.

33:04.920 --> 33:06.615
Oh, come on, you're not
gonna walk away from this.

33:06.915 --> 33:07.580
Not gonna happen.

33:07.660 --> 33:10.450
Mike, we could cut
this room up in an hour.

33:13.060 --> 33:17.190
All right, run along, then.
Say hi to her for me.

33:17.270 --> 33:21.400
- Me, too.
- I will. Take care of him.

33:25.340 --> 33:27.900
Jesus. What a fuckin' waste.

33:27.980 --> 33:30.440
Do you believe that?
She's really got him by the balls.

33:30.510 --> 33:33.310
- That's not so bad, is it?
- Depends on the grip.

33:33.380 --> 33:35.870
- Come on, give me $2,000.
- On the finger?

33:35.950 --> 33:38.890
You heard Mike.
He's good for it. Come on.

33:38.950 --> 33:42.290
Look, I'm gonna triple that
in half an hour, princess. Let's go.

33:42.360 --> 33:44.720
Okay.

34:02.610 --> 34:04.670
Hey.

34:04.750 --> 34:07.040
Reunion run a little late?

34:07.110 --> 34:09.909
I was gonna call,
but I didn't want to wake you up.

34:09.980 --> 34:12.510
It's okay.
I wasn't sleeping.

34:12.590 --> 34:15.179
Well, why don't you change
and we'll get a cab.

34:17.760 --> 34:19.850
Um, why don't you just go ahead,
and I'm gonna jump in the shower.

34:19.929 --> 34:23.659
And if I miss a little bit of the Mulligan
meeting, just cover for me, all right?

34:32.270 --> 34:34.239
Hey.

34:35.580 --> 34:38.370
At least give me a story.
You know, I mean--

34:38.449 --> 34:40.780
I mean, tell me you were
out drinking till you threw up.

34:40.850 --> 34:44.080
Tell me you were getting
lap dances over at Scores.

34:44.150 --> 34:47.989
- I don't care, just give me something.
- I was entertaining Worm.

34:48.060 --> 34:50.679
- Uh-huh.
- The least I can do for the guy.

34:50.760 --> 34:54.420
- So, you were nowhere near a card game.
- Sweetie.

34:54.500 --> 34:56.690
What?
I'm asking you a question.

34:56.760 --> 35:00.260
- I'm just--
- No. I was nowhere near a card game.

35:00.330 --> 35:02.600
All right?

35:02.670 --> 35:04.600
All right.
I'll wait for you.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.840
I mean, the key is a seamless
passing of the baton among the team.

35:39.910 --> 35:43.470
I think the most important thing is to be
respectful to the judges but not obsequious.

35:43.540 --> 35:45.510
Now, wait a minute.
Make sure to be deferential.

35:45.580 --> 35:47.640
Gene Marinacci won't buy
deferential.

35:47.720 --> 35:49.770
Oh, it's Gene, is it?

35:49.850 --> 35:52.750
Well, I knew there was a reason
why you were lead counsel,

35:52.820 --> 35:55.760
and it's got nothing to do
with your punctuality.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.760
Sorry.
I couldn't find a cab.

35:57.830 --> 36:01.730
Anyway, when you make the opening remarks,
make sure you stick to the fact pattern.

36:01.800 --> 36:05.790
And use the right cites.
Use book cites, not Lexis.

36:05.870 --> 36:07.890
Hi, Jo.

36:07.970 --> 36:09.900
- Long time.
- Knish. How are you?

36:11.540 --> 36:14.570
The same.

36:14.640 --> 36:17.940
I don't mean to interrupt
you future magistrates and noblemen,

36:18.010 --> 36:19.980
but I, uh,
I need a word.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.820
- Um--
- It's important.

36:23.880 --> 36:26.350
Okay. Excuse me.

36:26.420 --> 36:28.480
Sorry.

36:30.960 --> 36:33.190
- I'll act as lead counsel.
- It's all right, Kelly.

36:33.260 --> 36:35.350
We were gonna
take a break anyway.

36:35.430 --> 36:37.920
Coffee time.

36:41.370 --> 36:44.630
The guy's a cheat.
He always has been.

36:44.710 --> 36:47.370
Right now, he's over at Chesterfield's,
ruining your reputation...

36:47.440 --> 36:49.380
with every lousy second
he deals.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.970
Shit. I told him.
Did anybody else see him?

36:52.050 --> 36:55.250
Nobody saw-- I heard it.
Snapping sound gave it away.

36:55.330 --> 36:57.760
I didn't know him,
I might not have noticed.

36:57.830 --> 37:00.590
I turn around, and I see him
with the mechanic's grip, I know.

37:00.660 --> 37:02.860
- You want one?
- Did you give him the office?

37:02.930 --> 37:05.870
I tried to warn him, but
he looked right through me.

37:05.940 --> 37:08.000
- All right, I'll go get him.
- No, no, no. He's okay now.

37:08.070 --> 37:10.800
Most of those Georges are at the tail
end of a 36-hour session.

37:10.880 --> 37:14.440
They can't see straight.
Come on, I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

37:14.510 --> 37:16.810
But if he's still there
when Roman and Maurice start their game,

37:16.880 --> 37:18.820
he's gonna wish he was
still inside.

37:18.880 --> 37:20.820
I'm gonna go get him.

37:22.820 --> 37:26.650
Amarillo Slim, the greatest
proposition gambler of all time,

37:26.720 --> 37:28.780
held to his father's maxim--

37:28.860 --> 37:32.160
"You can shear a sheep many times,
but skin him only once."

37:32.230 --> 37:34.490
Gotta bet my jacks.

37:34.570 --> 37:37.470
This is a lesson
Worm's never bothered to learn.

37:37.540 --> 37:40.100
Hey, guys.

37:40.170 --> 37:42.110
English only at the table,
no Russian.

37:42.170 --> 37:45.270
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

37:45.340 --> 37:47.940
If you want to see this seventh card,
you're gonna stop speaking fuckin' Sputnik.

37:48.010 --> 37:50.710
- Oh, da, motherfucker.
- You're worried we might work together.

37:50.780 --> 37:52.770
I'm sure you're just talking
about perogies...

37:52.850 --> 37:54.880
and snow and shit, but let's
cut it out, all right?

37:54.950 --> 37:57.150
There's the river,
down and dirty.

37:59.160 --> 38:01.890
I think you got that ace,
Roman, but I'm gonna pay for it.

38:03.430 --> 38:05.400
Okay, well,
I got the jacks. Come on.

38:05.460 --> 38:07.620
- Ace. - Oh, you
got it. - And six.

38:07.700 --> 38:09.790
Wow, two pair.
But I got sevens, too, though.

38:09.870 --> 38:13.770
- With my jacks.
- Motherfucker, slow rolling me like that.

38:13.840 --> 38:15.860
You said just jacks.

38:15.940 --> 38:17.870
But you made me for the sevens,
Maurice. You're a player.

38:17.940 --> 38:21.000
- Fuck!
- Hey, come on! Don't be a fuckin' baby.

38:21.080 --> 38:23.170
- Hey, Maurice.
- Hey.

38:23.250 --> 38:25.770
Hey, Mike, you here to play?
Come on, we need some new blood.

38:25.850 --> 38:28.750
They're putting a fucking bracelet
on me tomorrow for four months.

38:28.820 --> 38:31.310
- I already stuck two racks.
- Well, have a good rest, man.

38:31.390 --> 38:33.320
Can I talk to you
for a second, Cosmonaut?

38:33.390 --> 38:36.480
No, man, I'm on a roll.
This is a very emotional game.

38:36.560 --> 38:38.530
Gotta do it.

38:38.600 --> 38:41.090
I counted these.

38:41.170 --> 38:43.130
Leave it.
It's fine.

38:49.210 --> 38:51.200
- What's going on?
- Where are you at?

38:51.280 --> 38:54.340
I was pumped up eight G's. I was ready
to go on a run when you came along.

38:54.410 --> 38:57.470
- All right, listen.
- Hey, wait, I want a hot dog.

38:57.550 --> 39:00.280
You're in town for five fuckin' minutes,
you already got a sign on your back.

39:00.350 --> 39:03.450
Oh, what, that fuckin' Knish
rat me out?

39:03.520 --> 39:05.510
You gotta stop listening
to that guy, man.

39:05.590 --> 39:07.890
He sees all the angles, but
he doesn't have the balls to play one.

39:07.960 --> 39:10.220
Hey, that guy hasn't had to
work in 15 years, Worm.

39:10.290 --> 39:12.630
You don't think that's work,
what he does?

39:12.700 --> 39:14.990
Grinding it out on his fuckin'
leather ass? No, thank you.

39:15.070 --> 39:18.030
I thought so, too, all right?
Now I know what real work is.

39:18.100 --> 39:20.630
Speaking of which,
are you even gonna get a job?

39:20.700 --> 39:22.930
Or are you just gonna go back
to printing those credit cards?

39:23.010 --> 39:25.270
- Huh? You gonna go away again?
- I wasn't printing.

39:25.340 --> 39:28.180
I was distributing. Distributing.
It's different, okay?

39:28.250 --> 39:30.410
Second of all, I'm never
going back there.

39:30.480 --> 39:32.880
Stop worrying
so much, okay?

39:32.950 --> 39:34.880
Come here.

39:36.720 --> 39:40.160
I just want you to think
long term, all right? Be smart.

39:40.220 --> 39:43.090
Every place in Manhattan,
they all keep books, all right?

39:43.160 --> 39:44.212
If you get listed
as a mechanic,

39:44.512 --> 39:46.360
then not only are you gonna
get the shit kicked out of you,

39:46.430 --> 39:49.160
you're not gonna get a fuckin' game
anywhere in New York.

39:49.230 --> 39:51.570
It's stupid.
It's just bad business.

39:51.640 --> 39:54.630
Look, this is what I love about you--
you think about the big picture.

39:54.710 --> 39:56.640
That's great, okay?
But it's not me.

39:56.710 --> 39:58.970
I don't play the game straight up,
and then if I lose,

39:59.040 --> 40:00.980
go get some real work
or something, okay?

40:01.050 --> 40:02.980
I see a mark,
I take him down.

40:03.050 --> 40:05.070
That's what I do.
That's the way I live.

40:05.150 --> 40:07.670
I know. Listen, you're the guy
who taught me all the angles.

40:07.750 --> 40:09.810
But I'm not the guy with
my nose open right now.

40:10.110 --> 40:10.740
Aw, come on.

40:10.820 --> 40:14.150
I'm not gonna preach to you, but those
two guys in there, they're not rabbits.

40:14.220 --> 40:17.490
Roman and Maurice?
They're Russian outfit guys.

40:17.560 --> 40:20.430
Not as bad as KGB, but you don't want
to be fuckin' with those guys.

40:20.500 --> 40:24.490
With those fake
Versace shirts and shit? Jesus.

40:24.570 --> 40:28.530
Look, you still got time.
Just go back in there, right?

40:28.610 --> 40:30.540
Lose their fuckin' money
back to 'em, all right?

40:30.610 --> 40:32.630
Just make it look good.
Just catch a run of real shitty cards.

40:32.710 --> 40:34.700
- Give it back to 'em.
- I can't. I can't.

40:34.780 --> 40:37.540
I gotta put some scratch together, man.
I gotta get somethin' going.

40:37.610 --> 40:40.950
Then go out to suburbia, man. Play
in a fuckin' dentist's game, okay?

40:41.020 --> 40:43.794
Go to Swan Meadow,
play in the golf pro game.

40:44.094 --> 40:45.180
That's an idea.

40:45.260 --> 40:48.750
I'll definitely do that,
but I can't dump to these guys.

40:48.830 --> 40:51.520
You got to.

40:51.600 --> 40:53.530
All right,
whatever, whatever.

40:53.600 --> 40:56.360
Meet me at Stromboli's
in half an hour, all right?

40:56.430 --> 40:58.400
I can't, I gotta go.
I have a meeting.

40:58.470 --> 41:00.400
And then I gotta go to fuckin' Queens.
I gotta load the truck.

41:00.470 --> 41:03.170
Jesus, man, you're such a fuckin'
workin' man now. I'm never gonna see you.

41:03.240 --> 41:05.736
Make it look good. I
mean it, make it look good.

41:06.036 --> 41:06.800
You know me.

41:18.960 --> 41:21.080
- So, how'd you do?
- Ah, so-so.

41:22.790 --> 41:24.950
Six thousand,
two thousand.

41:25.030 --> 41:28.620
Oh, hold on.
Two more.

41:28.700 --> 41:30.630
All right, so it's
ten grand total,

41:30.700 --> 41:32.670
take back the two we lent you,
give you the white meat.

41:32.740 --> 41:34.700
You know what?

41:34.770 --> 41:37.260
Why don't you give me
all of it?

41:37.340 --> 41:39.740
Usually, credit players
only leave with their profit.

41:39.810 --> 41:42.070
Otherwise, the juice starts
five points a week on Mike.

41:42.150 --> 41:44.080
Oh, okay.
We'll owe you.

41:59.330 --> 42:03.460
Hey. I've been looking
all over for you.

42:03.530 --> 42:05.470
Didn't want to
be found.

42:05.540 --> 42:08.870
You know, Petrovsky waited and waited.
So did the rest of the group.

42:08.940 --> 42:11.840
- Jo, look, I missed one meeting.
- It's not about the meeting.

42:11.910 --> 42:15.440
I don't care about the meeting. Do
you even know why I left this morning?

42:15.510 --> 42:17.260
I found that gangster's
roll in your pocket.

42:17.560 --> 42:18.610
It's not what you think.

42:18.680 --> 42:19.889
It's not what you think.

42:20.189 --> 42:22.810
Who do you think I am?
You lie right to my face?

42:22.890 --> 42:25.980
Look, old days at least
you never lied.

42:26.060 --> 42:28.150
You lost everything,
but at least you never lied.

42:30.530 --> 42:34.290
Jo, this wasn't even a real game.
This was like Wiffle Ball.

42:34.360 --> 42:35.496
Can you lose your
rent playing Wiffle Ball?

42:35.796 --> 42:36.390
No, I couldn't lose.

42:36.470 --> 42:39.030
- That's the point.
- No, Mike, you can lose.

42:39.100 --> 42:42.070
I watched you, I stood by you while
you lost everything before.

42:42.140 --> 42:43.720
I don't think I can go
through that with you again.

42:44.020 --> 42:44.840
Jo, I wasn't gonna lose!

42:44.910 --> 42:47.210
Why does this still seem
like gambling to you?

42:47.280 --> 42:49.750
Why do you think the same five guys
make it to the final table...

42:49.810 --> 42:52.300
at the World Series of Poker
every single year?

42:52.380 --> 42:54.510
What are they, the luckiest guys
in Las Vegas?

42:54.590 --> 42:58.650
- It's a skill game, Jo.
- Great. So why'd you have to lie to me?

42:58.720 --> 43:02.920
- Because I knew you wouldn't understand.
- Understand what?

43:02.990 --> 43:06.900
Last night, I sat down
at this card table.

43:06.960 --> 43:12.230
I felt alive for the first time since
I got busted at KGB's joint, okay?

43:12.300 --> 43:15.330
You just told me you felt alive for
the first time at a fucking card table.

43:15.410 --> 43:16.410
No, what--

43:16.475 --> 43:19.507
What's that supposed
to make me understand?

43:50.107 --> 43:51.570
I heard you was out.

43:51.640 --> 43:54.110
Hey, fuckin' Grama.
How you doin'?

43:54.180 --> 43:55.746
I was just thinkin' about
you. You know, I could use you.

43:56.046 --> 43:56.370
Oh, yeah?

43:56.450 --> 43:58.940
See me in, like, two weeks.
I'll put you back on the payroll.

43:59.020 --> 44:03.460
Well, I got some bad news for ya, Worm.
I'm out on my own now.

44:03.530 --> 44:06.020
- Really?
- Yeah.

44:06.100 --> 44:08.190
Go figure.

44:08.270 --> 44:11.640
There were a lot of angry people when
you went away. A lot of people were mad.

44:11.710 --> 44:14.040
I know, Grama, that's why I'm trying
to put together a roll here.

44:14.110 --> 44:16.100
A lot of people coming up to me,
asking if I could help,

44:16.180 --> 44:18.140
asking if I knew
where to find you.

44:18.210 --> 44:20.840
- So, it got me to thinkin'.
- Really, you thinkin' now? That's big.

44:20.910 --> 44:24.080
Hey, Jesus! Come on!
Take it easy.

44:24.150 --> 44:26.590
It's just
a friend of mine.

44:26.650 --> 44:30.020
Hey! Easy, easy, easy, easy.
God!

44:30.090 --> 44:33.180
Get the fuck outta here.
What did I say?

44:33.260 --> 44:36.490
- Hey, man, take it easy!
- Get the fuck outta here!

44:38.100 --> 44:40.900
Okay.
Here's what I'm thinkin'.

44:40.970 --> 44:44.500
Instead of you owing 15 grand spread out
to five guys, you owe 25 to me.

44:44.570 --> 44:47.010
What? Where the fuck
do you get off? 25 grand?

44:47.070 --> 44:49.630
Where the fuck
do I get off?

44:49.710 --> 44:51.700
Ohh.

44:51.780 --> 44:55.710
Here's how it is. 25 grand,
and the juice is still runnin'.

44:55.780 --> 44:58.250
Jesus Christ.

44:58.320 --> 45:00.450
What the fuck are you doin', man?
You were my partner.

45:00.520 --> 45:02.450
No, no,
I was your lackey.

45:02.520 --> 45:04.460
But I learned
a few things, Worm.

45:04.520 --> 45:08.290
I consolidated
your outstanding debt.

45:08.360 --> 45:11.630
Where'd you get
the scratch for that?

45:11.700 --> 45:14.930
You've been rolling fags
in the Village again.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.440
Still a wise ass. Unbelievable.

45:17.500 --> 45:20.060
What I did was go partners
with an old friend of yours.

45:20.140 --> 45:23.470
Teddy KGB backed me.

45:23.540 --> 45:26.030
Bullshit.
Bullshit.

45:27.110 --> 45:30.710
Teddy's got plenty of goons.

45:30.780 --> 45:32.840
Why would he put you
under his flag?

45:32.920 --> 45:37.650
Because as soon as he heard your name,
he became real excited for the prospect.

45:37.720 --> 45:40.350
What, so you bought me up, Grama?

45:40.430 --> 45:43.690
Yeah, got a real sweet deal, too.
30 cents on the dollar.

45:43.760 --> 45:46.890
There's not a lot of faith in you
out there in the business community.

45:46.970 --> 45:49.830
Great, so you're a banker now, Grama.
That's really classy.

45:49.900 --> 45:53.770
Not exactly. I don't have to tell you
my collection methods.

45:53.840 --> 45:55.770
Oh, God. All right, look.

45:55.840 --> 45:57.810
Just take it easy,
all right?

45:57.880 --> 45:59.940
I'll scrape something together,
and I'll find you this week.

46:00.010 --> 46:02.310
- That's just what I figured.
- No, no, no.

46:02.380 --> 46:05.157
So I'm gonna take what
you got on you right now.

46:05.457 --> 46:06.250
Here. Fine.

46:06.320 --> 46:09.880
Have yourself
a ball, okay?

46:11.960 --> 46:14.480
God!

46:14.560 --> 46:17.290
Damn!

46:29.540 --> 46:31.480
Excuse me.

46:43.060 --> 46:44.990
Mind if I sit?

46:45.060 --> 46:47.490
Michael.

46:47.560 --> 46:50.460
Please, please.
Sit, sit.

46:52.670 --> 46:55.100
That was a nifty trick
the other night.

46:57.170 --> 46:59.260
- It was wonderful.
- Thank you.

46:59.340 --> 47:03.070
Marinacci and the D.A. were ready to cut
cards for your services at that point.

47:05.650 --> 47:09.450
Of course, it was an altogether
different trick, that disappearing act...

47:09.520 --> 47:11.510
you pulled today
at your group's meeting.

47:11.590 --> 47:14.814
Yeah. Well, I figure
I owe you an explanation.

47:15.114 --> 47:16.280
Ah, not to me.

47:16.360 --> 47:18.450
I'm sure there's
a good reason you left.

47:18.530 --> 47:20.820
You'll just have to
work harder. Prepare.

47:20.890 --> 47:24.330
And smooth things out with the others.

47:24.400 --> 47:27.660
Right. Yeah.
Okay.

47:27.730 --> 47:31.400
- Okay, well, thanks.
- Stay. Take a drink.

47:32.840 --> 47:34.770
- Jamie?
- Yeah?

47:34.840 --> 47:37.470
- Another glass, darling.
- Sure.

47:37.540 --> 47:39.670
- What are you drinking?
- Gin. Always gin.

47:39.750 --> 47:41.680
- Here you go.
- Thanks, dear.

47:41.750 --> 47:44.110
Thank you.

47:44.180 --> 47:47.520
I know a magician doesn't
divulge his secrets, but--

47:47.590 --> 47:50.250
I'm no magician.

47:50.320 --> 47:53.720
Well, if it wasn't magic,

47:53.790 --> 47:56.390
how did you know
what everyone held?

47:56.460 --> 47:59.400
It's a combination
of things.

47:59.470 --> 48:01.530
Um, I was watching
when the cards came out.

48:01.600 --> 48:06.060
That's-- That's just an old habit
with me, like breathing.

48:06.140 --> 48:08.160
You watch the cards.

48:08.240 --> 48:11.680
I watch the cards also, but I watch
the players reacting to the cards.

48:11.750 --> 48:14.310
That's how I knew the D.A.
made his two pair,

48:14.380 --> 48:16.820
and Judge Kaplan
missed the flush.

48:16.880 --> 48:19.250
I was watching their eyes
when they checked their river cards.

48:19.320 --> 48:22.580
- Their faces tell you everything.
- You watch the man.

48:22.660 --> 48:26.820
I-- I never knew you had
to calculate so much at cards.

48:32.500 --> 48:36.270
All right, here's the thing.
You only play premium hands.

48:36.340 --> 48:39.130
You only start
with jacks or better split,

48:39.210 --> 48:41.730
nines or better wired,
three high cards to a flush.

48:41.810 --> 48:44.640
If it's good enough to call, you gotta
be in there raising, all right?

48:44.710 --> 48:48.610
I mean, tight, but aggressive. And I do mean
aggressive. That's your style, Professor.

48:48.680 --> 48:51.450
I mean, you gotta--
you gotta think of it as a war.

48:51.520 --> 48:55.550
You are officially never
invited to our game again.

48:57.720 --> 49:01.520
I don't blame you. Put a guy like me in a
game like that, the cards don't even matter.

49:01.600 --> 49:03.530
I'll play it blind.

49:05.470 --> 49:08.800
Michael,

49:08.870 --> 49:11.960
- may I tell you a story?
- Please.

49:12.040 --> 49:17.340
For generations,
men of my family have been rabbis.

49:17.410 --> 49:20.470
In Israel,
before that in Europe.

49:20.550 --> 49:24.240
It was to be my calling.
I was quite a prodigy.

49:24.320 --> 49:26.720
The pride of my yeshiva.

49:26.790 --> 49:29.020
The elders said I had
a 40-year-old's understanding...

49:29.090 --> 49:32.750
of the midrash
by the time I was 12.

49:32.830 --> 49:35.090
But by the time
I was 13,

49:36.600 --> 49:38.930
I knew I could never
be a rabbi.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.930
Why not?

49:41.000 --> 49:44.330
Because for all
I understood of the Talmud,

49:46.310 --> 49:49.000
I never saw
God there.

49:49.080 --> 49:51.840
- You couldn't lie to yourself.
- I tried.

49:51.910 --> 49:53.850
Tried like crazy.

49:53.910 --> 49:57.150
I mean, people were
counting on me.

49:57.220 --> 50:00.310
But yours is
a respectable profession.

50:00.390 --> 50:02.320
Not to my family.

50:02.390 --> 50:06.760
My parents were destroyed,
devastated by my decision.

50:08.600 --> 50:13.900
My father sent me away
to New York...

50:13.970 --> 50:16.730
to live
with distant cousins.

50:16.800 --> 50:19.600
Eventually, I--
I found my place,

50:19.670 --> 50:22.440
my life's work.

50:23.840 --> 50:26.280
What then?

50:26.350 --> 50:29.280
I immersed myself fully,
I studied the minutiae,

50:29.350 --> 50:31.780
I learned everything I could
about the law.

50:31.850 --> 50:34.840
I mean, I felt deeply inside
that it was what I was born to do.

50:38.090 --> 50:41.460
- And did your parents get over it?
- No.

50:41.530 --> 50:45.660
I always hoped
that I would find...

50:45.730 --> 50:48.670
some way to change
their minds, but--

50:52.370 --> 50:54.310
They were
inconsolable.

50:56.310 --> 50:59.340
My father never spoke
to me again.

51:03.350 --> 51:06.680
If you had to do it
all over again,

51:06.750 --> 51:10.560
would you make
the same choices?

51:10.630 --> 51:12.900
What choice?

51:16.410 --> 51:19.600
The last thing I took away
from the yeshiva is this--

51:21.850 --> 51:24.280
We can't run
from who we are.

51:26.520 --> 51:28.780
Our destiny chooses us.

51:32.120 --> 51:34.750
Hey.
L'chayim.

51:55.580 --> 51:57.510
Hey.

51:57.580 --> 51:59.550
Hey, where you been?
I've been freezing my ass off.

51:59.620 --> 52:03.210
- What happened?
- Ah, ran into a door. Don't worry about it.

52:03.290 --> 52:03.900
What happened?

52:04.200 --> 52:06.380
Hey! She crossed her
legs too fast, all right?

52:06.460 --> 52:08.580
- Just mind your own business.
- You comin' up?

52:08.660 --> 52:10.960
No, I've been standing out here
all this time just to say hi.

52:11.030 --> 52:13.660
Listen, things haven't
been that smooth on the home front,

52:13.730 --> 52:16.320
so tone it down
a little, all right?

52:16.400 --> 52:19.030
- Tone down what, motherfucker?
- Great.

52:19.100 --> 52:21.590
Never mind.

52:24.040 --> 52:26.980
When you become a big shot lawyer,
could you find us an elevator building?

52:27.040 --> 52:28.980
Shut up.

52:32.920 --> 52:35.750
What, did you
get robbed?

52:35.820 --> 52:38.520
Um, not exactly.

52:39.620 --> 52:43.420
Wait, wait, wait.
Did she split on you?

52:43.490 --> 52:46.550
Oh, God.

52:48.260 --> 52:52.290
Oh, my God. Mike, she made off
with your sheets.

52:52.370 --> 52:54.860
I always told her she'd be
a good card player.

52:54.940 --> 52:56.742
Know exactly when to
release a shitty hand.

52:57.042 --> 52:58.270
Come on, Mike, forget that.

52:58.340 --> 53:01.140
This girl is obviously
wrapped way too tight for living.

53:01.210 --> 53:05.270
No, she was a good-- I knew it.
I fuckin' knew it.

53:10.390 --> 53:12.350
It's depressing.

53:12.420 --> 53:14.520
You can't trust 'em.
You can't trust 'em at all.

53:14.590 --> 53:18.360
I mean, look at you.
You domesticated yourself for this girl.

53:18.430 --> 53:21.230
You took yourself out of the life.
You walked the fuckin' line for her.

53:21.300 --> 53:24.660
And the minute you want a little
of it back, she walks out on you.

53:24.730 --> 53:27.670
It's just like
the saying says, you know?

53:27.740 --> 53:32.670
In the poker game of life,
women are the rake.

53:32.740 --> 53:36.040
- They are the fuckin' rake.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

53:36.110 --> 53:39.570
What saying?

53:39.650 --> 53:44.140
I don't know.
But there oughta be one.

53:47.090 --> 53:50.990
You know what cheers me
up when I'm feelin' shitty?

53:51.290 --> 53:51.890
What?

53:51.960 --> 53:54.560
Rolled up aces over kings.

53:57.970 --> 53:59.900
- That right?
- Yeah.

53:59.970 --> 54:04.300
Check raising stupid tourists
and taking huge pots off 'em.

54:04.370 --> 54:04.726
Yeah?

54:05.026 --> 54:08.870
Stacks and towers of
checks I can't even see over.

54:08.950 --> 54:13.440
Playin' all night,
high-limit Hold 'Em at the Taj.

54:13.520 --> 54:17.110
- Where the sand turns to gold.
- Fuck it, let's go.

54:18.620 --> 54:21.180
- Don't tease me.
- Let's play some fuckin' cards.

54:35.140 --> 54:37.070
The poker room at the Mirage in Vegas...

54:37.140 --> 54:39.940
is the center of
the poker universe.

54:40.010 --> 54:42.310
Doyle Brunson, Johnny Chan,
Phil Helmuth--

54:42.380 --> 54:44.640
The legends consider it
their office.

54:44.710 --> 54:46.650
Every couple of days
a new millionaire shows up...

54:46.720 --> 54:48.880
wanting to beat
a world champion.

54:48.950 --> 54:52.120
Usually they go home
with nothing but a story.

54:52.190 --> 54:54.250
Down here, the millionaires are scarce
or they're playing craps,

54:54.320 --> 54:56.820
but there's still
plenty of money for the taking.

54:56.890 --> 54:58.830
In fact, on the weekends
you can't get a game in the city,

54:58.900 --> 55:02.090
because all the New York rounders
are taking care of the tourists here.

55:02.170 --> 55:05.730
Hey, hey, why don't you warm up
a seat for me. I'll catch up with you.

55:05.800 --> 55:08.170
- What?
- Look.

55:08.240 --> 55:10.203
I got certain needs
I gotta attend to, okay?

55:10.503 --> 55:11.070
Hey, good.

55:11.140 --> 55:11.681
I mean, I'm overdue.

55:11.981 --> 55:13.470
Good, man, hey, I was
startin' to wonder about you.

55:13.540 --> 55:17.380
I thought, maybe, you know, the boys
upstate brought about a few changes in you.

55:17.450 --> 55:21.280
Hey, in your dreams,
lover.

55:28.860 --> 55:30.850
- Hey, Mikey! -
Hey. - Hey, Mike.

55:30.930 --> 55:34.490
This is beautiful.
Welcome to the Chesterfield south.

55:34.560 --> 55:36.830
- Ho!
- Changing $500.

55:36.900 --> 55:39.730
Come all the way to Atlantic City
just to see your mugs, huh?

55:39.800 --> 55:41.860
Twice in one week.

55:41.940 --> 55:44.930
For someone who don't play, you spend
a lot of time in card rooms.

55:45.010 --> 55:46.940
This is what
I like to see, huh?

55:47.010 --> 55:50.100
Mike McDermott where he belongs--
sittin' with the scumbags.

55:50.180 --> 55:52.810
Tellin' jokes,
draggin' the occasional pot.

55:52.880 --> 55:56.840
Occasional? Yeah, like my ex-wife
occasionally went out with other men.

55:56.920 --> 56:01.380
Forget her, Face. I was actually gonna
try and make some real money tonight.

56:01.460 --> 56:05.090
But in honor of Mike's
alley-like return to the ring,

56:05.160 --> 56:07.130
I'll sit with you all
for a while.

56:07.200 --> 56:09.260
Hey, don't do us
any favors, Knish.

56:09.330 --> 56:11.861
They're about to go to the
board to fill these seats.

56:12.161 --> 56:12.630
Bet it.

56:12.700 --> 56:16.230
I raise. You know, if we wanted
to take each other's rolls,

56:16.310 --> 56:18.240
we could have just
stayed home.

56:19.910 --> 56:21.840
These two have no idea...

56:21.910 --> 56:25.350
what they're about to
walk into.

56:25.420 --> 56:27.380
Down here to have a good time,
they figure...

56:27.450 --> 56:30.820
why not give poker a try?

56:30.890 --> 56:32.980
After all, how different
can it be from the home games...

56:33.060 --> 56:35.020
they've played
their whole lives?

56:37.130 --> 56:41.590
All the luck in the world isn't
gonna change things for these guys.

56:41.660 --> 56:44.930
They're simply overmatched.

56:47.170 --> 56:51.040
We're not playing together, but then again,
we're not playing against each other either.

56:51.110 --> 56:55.340
It's like the Nature Channel. You don't
see piranhas eating each other, do you?

57:03.190 --> 57:06.380
They wear their tells
like signs around their necks.

57:06.460 --> 57:09.450
Facial tics, nervous fingers.

57:09.530 --> 57:11.460
A hand over a mouth.

57:11.530 --> 57:14.430
The way a cigarette
is smoked.

57:14.500 --> 57:17.630
Little unconscious gestures
that reveal the cards in their hands.

57:17.700 --> 57:20.100
We catch everything.

57:20.170 --> 57:22.760
If a fish acts strong,
he's bluffing.

57:22.840 --> 57:26.280
If he acts meek,
he's got a hand. It's that simple.

57:32.280 --> 57:34.770
- How are you, you workaholics?
- Worm.

57:34.850 --> 57:37.410
Good to see ya.
Glad you're out.

57:37.490 --> 57:39.580
Number's changed,
of course.

57:39.660 --> 57:41.780
Lotta games this weekend,
so you're gonna need the number.

57:41.860 --> 57:43.790
- I'll give you a ring.
- Hey, Worm?

57:43.860 --> 57:46.120
Do they allow people like you
in places like this?

57:46.200 --> 57:49.760
Zagosh, when you get yourself a job,
then you can be my fuckin' P.O.

57:49.830 --> 57:51.770
How about that?

57:51.830 --> 57:54.460
Now, let's get started,
shall we?

57:54.540 --> 57:56.470
I'm sorry, sir.

57:56.540 --> 57:59.240
You can't take chips
from another player at the table.

57:59.310 --> 58:01.300
We all know each other here.

58:01.380 --> 58:04.180
We're like friends, so if nobody
complains, do you have a problem?

58:04.250 --> 58:06.180
- It's all right.
- No problem.

58:06.250 --> 58:10.780
Sir, you have to buy 'em from me.

58:10.850 --> 58:13.908
Fuck this low-limit shit.
Can we go get something to eat?

58:14.208 --> 58:15.790
I got comped at the noodle bar.

58:15.860 --> 58:17.720
I want to talk to you.

58:17.800 --> 58:19.970
Look who's treatin'
to a free meal.

58:23.800 --> 58:27.930
You keep grinding out that rent money,
Joe. It's noble work you're doing.

58:28.000 --> 58:31.230
So, hey, uh,
Nick the Greek.

58:31.310 --> 58:33.240
What's with
kitin' my checks?

58:34.880 --> 58:37.400
- I'm on empty, that's why.
- You are? You're tapped again?

58:37.480 --> 58:39.710
I mean--
How much was the hooker?

58:39.780 --> 58:44.220
Mike, please. Relaxation therapist.

58:44.290 --> 58:46.250
Okay?

58:46.320 --> 58:48.690
- It's not where it went.
- Wait a minute.

58:48.760 --> 58:50.690
It went to
Roman and Maurice?

58:50.760 --> 58:53.320
I told you, man, you didn't have to
give it all back to 'em.

58:53.390 --> 58:55.950
Take a little money
for your time, you know?

58:56.030 --> 58:58.000
Hey, that's not
where it went either.

59:00.400 --> 59:02.600
- I ran into Grama tonight.
- Yeah?

59:02.670 --> 59:04.640
Yeah. He took
everything I had.

59:04.710 --> 59:07.070
You're kiddin' me.
Wait, who's he working for?

59:09.080 --> 59:11.410
Well, he's sorta
out on his own.

59:11.480 --> 59:14.180
This fucker went around
and bought up all my debt. Grama.

59:14.250 --> 59:17.810
That turncoat motherfucker.
Are you kiddin' me?

59:17.890 --> 59:20.320
So what do you owe him?

59:20.390 --> 59:22.650
I don't know. By his crazy fuckin'
gorilla math?

59:22.720 --> 59:24.660
Like, 15.

59:24.730 --> 59:27.720
- Fifteen? Fifteen?
- Yeah, I mean--

59:27.800 --> 59:30.820
He says the juice has been running
the entire time on my ten.

59:30.900 --> 59:32.870
- So, it's just like--
- Why didn't you tell me that, man?

59:32.930 --> 59:35.460
Why did you not tell me that?
I could have paid that off.

59:35.540 --> 59:37.800
- I had the-- I had the money.
- Hey!

59:37.870 --> 59:40.710
I'm not gonna sit in the can and have
my friend paying down my debt.

59:40.780 --> 59:42.710
I'm not a leech,
all right?

59:42.780 --> 59:45.710
We can help each other, like always.
That's why we're here.

59:45.780 --> 59:48.150
That's-- That's why we gotta
get in the bigger game.

59:48.220 --> 59:50.150
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- All right. All right.

59:50.220 --> 59:52.062
Listen, man, I'll help you.
You know I'll help you, man.

59:52.362 --> 59:52.620
Yeah?

59:52.690 --> 59:54.445
I mean, fuck that guy.
We'll figure something out.

59:54.745 --> 59:55.020
Yeah.

01:00:00.790 --> 01:00:02.730
How long
should we wait?

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:06.360
I suggest we wait another five minutes,
and then choose another lead counsel.

01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:12.900
Here he comes.

01:00:14.970 --> 01:00:18.810
Mr. McDermott,
perhaps we can begin now.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.810
I'm so sorry I'm late.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:26.550
Come to order in the matter of Slater v.
New York State Higher Education Services.

01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:30.720
The facts have been stipulated,
the briefs have been read.

01:00:30.790 --> 01:00:34.230
Lead counsel for plaintiff,
Mr. McDermott,

01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:38.890
please proceed
with oral arguments now.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.260
If that is convenient
for you.

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:47.800
Yes, it is, and again,
I'm sorry, ah, that I'm late.

01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:50.600
Um--

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:54.110
Well, I think clearly
the, uh--

01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:59.080
the case which controls the issue at bar
would be, uh, Texas v.Johnson,

01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:02.640
- which holds--
- Texas v.Johnson?

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:06.620
Mr. McDermott, that is a Supreme Court
free speech case...

01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:09.490
that has no bearing
in the premises.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:13.090
Each group was apprised to ignore
that aspect of this matter...

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:17.190
and focus instead on the idea
of de facto segregation.

01:01:18.570 --> 01:01:21.200
Right. Um, well--

01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:23.210
Mr. McDermott has
been unreachable,

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.510
so I'll take over,
if it pleases the court.

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:29.780
Someone saying something meaningful
would please us a great deal.

01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:34.050
What we have here is a clear case
of gerrymandering,

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:37.050
impacting schoolchildren
and schools in the district...

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:40.110
that was created solely
to separate students by race.

01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:43.820
Although not dispositive, the student
body is more than 99 percent white.

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:46.390
Well, that
was impressive.

01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:50.560
Usually you have to know something about
a case to give an opening statement.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.970
Guys, what--
what can I say?

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:57.500
Hey, it worked out great for me, McDermott.
I think I actually impressed Marinacci.

01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:59.510
Jo.

01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:02.910
- Jo.Jo.
- What?

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:07.110
We're not gonna talk?
You left me pretty quick there.

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:09.060
You make it sound as
if it was my decision.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.380
Well, it wasn't mine.

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:14.830
I came home and you were gone.
You were just gonna drop me like that?

01:02:14.890 --> 01:02:16.880
I learned it
from you, Mike.

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.230
You always told me
that this was the rule.

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:23.230
Rule number one: Throw in your cards
the moment you know they can't win.

01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:23.927
Fold the hand.

01:02:24.227 --> 01:02:26.600
Look, this is our thing
that we're talking about.

01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:29.510
It's not some
losing hand of poker.

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:33.740
I know exactly what
we're talking about, Mike.

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:39.750
So, that's the last
of it, then?

01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:44.360
Yeah.

01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:58.760
I mean, I'd say good luck, but I know
it's not about luck in your game.

01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:09.370
Eric Seidel cannot win this hand,

01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:11.750
and yet
he doesn't know it.

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:16.910
Chan is trying to sucker him in
by taking his time.

01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:20.580
Oh, look at that look
of the defending champ.

01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:24.220
And now Fifth Street,
a six of diamonds. No help.

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:27.930
Johnny Chan has
a queen high straight.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.770
Will Eric Seidel
fall for the bait?

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:35.400
Yes, he's going all in,
and Chan has him.

01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:37.740
Johnny Chan, the master--

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:44.150
Yes, he's going all in,
and Chan has him.

01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:50.850
- Hello.
- Oh, hey, Mike. It's Petra. Can I come up?

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:52.860
Yeah, I'll buzz you in.

01:03:57.260 --> 01:04:00.560
Well, that's the important thing
with the game of Hold 'Em.

01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:02.960
You're never down and out
until your chips are all gone.

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:06.970
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.170
- How you doing?
- Good.

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:16.780
I haven't seen the place in a while.

01:04:16.850 --> 01:04:18.780
Looks about the same.

01:04:18.850 --> 01:04:23.190
- You want some scotch or something?
- No, I'm fine.

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:27.850
- Oh, '88 World Series, huh?
- Yeah.

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:29.860
Johnny Chan.

01:04:29.930 --> 01:04:33.560
Flops the nut straight and
has the discipline to wait him out.

01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:36.290
He knows Seidel's
gonna bluff at it.

01:04:36.370 --> 01:04:39.300
And yet he doesn't know it.
- Johnny fucking Chan.

01:04:39.370 --> 01:04:43.310
Chan is trying to sucker him in
by taking his time.

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:46.240
Look at the control.
Look at that fuck.

01:04:46.310 --> 01:04:49.510
He knows his man well enough
to check it all the way...

01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:52.070
and risk winning nothing
with those cards.

01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:54.090
He owns him.

01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:57.020
Will Eric Seidel fall for the bait?

01:04:57.090 --> 01:05:00.550
Yes, he's going all in
and Chan has him.

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:01.945
Johnny Chan, the master.

01:05:02.245 --> 01:05:04.820
Poor Seidel. Kid
doesn't know what hit him.

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:07.560
Yeah, I know
what that feels like.

01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:10.900
It's like a locomotive
running through your stomach.

01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:15.410
You feel gut-shot. Fuck it.
You didn't come here to talk about this.

01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:17.530
What's going on?

01:05:19.610 --> 01:05:23.550
- Tomorrow's a week.
- A week of what?

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:27.980
The first two thousand
you owe the Chesterfield.

01:05:28.050 --> 01:05:31.850
- Oh. Worm.
- Yes, it's kinda weird.

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:35.620
He'd just won eight grand.
Why go on the line behind another two?

01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:39.390
So, he took, what, about eight
off of Roman and Maurice?

01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:43.130
Yeah, yeah, he comes in
after you leave,

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:45.500
sits for like
another 20 more minutes,

01:05:45.570 --> 01:05:48.400
cashes out
for the full amount.

01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:52.530
Maurice hasn't been back since. I think
he's been playing across the street.

01:05:52.610 --> 01:05:56.240
But, uh, Worm's
been around plenty.

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:59.220
He's run you up
just under seven grand.

01:06:01.650 --> 01:06:05.210
Well, do me a favor
and just put him on his own.

01:06:05.290 --> 01:06:08.190
- Yeah?
- Yeah, cut him off.

01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:10.390
Um, I tell ya,
I got a thousand.

01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:13.120
I got a thou.
And that's, you know--

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:15.500
I just started
coming back, so--

01:06:15.570 --> 01:06:20.800
- Thanks for making it easy, Mike.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:25.570
I'm, uh-- I'm sorry to be back
over here for this reason.

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:29.550
- Don't worry about it.
- No, I-- I like being here.

01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:32.450
It's good
to see you, Mike.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:39.020
- I can stay.
- Listen, I tell ya, I'll-- I'll, um--

01:06:39.090 --> 01:06:41.990
I'll come-- I'll come--
I'll see you down at the club.

01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:44.760
- I'll come by this week.
- Yeah.

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:28.160
I know you're in here.

01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:35.780
Mike?

01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:38.780
Hey. I thought you
were the janitor, man.

01:07:38.850 --> 01:07:41.840
It's a good thing Grama
doesn't know you as well as I do.

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:44.910
Come on. I'll play ya horse.
Fifty bucks a letter.

01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:49.190
Yeah? When I win, are you gonna pay
me back with my own fucking money?

01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:52.990
Oh, oh, easy. Relax. Don't wing it.
Just--Just step and throw.

01:07:58.370 --> 01:08:00.570
You need to work
on your accuracy.

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.982
Will you stop fucking around
for five goddamn minutes

01:08:03.282 --> 01:08:04.540
for once in your fucking life!

01:08:04.610 --> 01:08:07.540
Whoa, Jesus. What happened?
My old man just walked in the door.

01:08:07.610 --> 01:08:10.740
I should fucking beat the shit
out of you the way he used to.

01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:16.010
You remember when we found
this place, man?

01:08:18.090 --> 01:08:20.580
Yeah, I remember
when we found this place.

01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:22.555
You were hiding from Tommy
Manzy 'cause you thought

01:08:22.856 --> 01:08:24.460
he was gonna fucking
pound you into oblivion.

01:08:24.529 --> 01:08:27.460
Yeah, now, see?
What did I ever do to that guy?

01:08:27.529 --> 01:08:30.760
You fucked his mother.

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:34.569
Yeah, but she was a good-looking
older woman. You gotta give me that.

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:38.600
You spent a year of your life hiding in
this fucking gym from that sick fuck...

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:41.979
until he pissed off the wrong guy and
someone dropped a garbage can on his head.

01:08:42.050 --> 01:08:44.910
What do you want me to say? Those
were wild times. You were there too.

01:08:44.979 --> 01:08:47.109
Nothing's changed.
Nothing has changed.

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:49.920
You were hiding from your troubles then.
You're hiding from your troubles now.

01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:52.550
I like to hide, and that's
part of the fun for me, you know?

01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:54.560
I don't like
running solo.

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:56.890
It's like I used to have a running
partner, you know what I'm saying?

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:59.399
If we fucked up back then
and got caught,

01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:03.529
the worst thing that was going to happen
was maybe catch a beating, get expelled.

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:07.800
But, man, you're fixing to go down hard,
and it almost seems like you want to.

01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:10.710
Stop worrying so much about me, okay?
I'm turning things around.

01:09:10.779 --> 01:09:13.340
I'm not gonna let anybody
drop a garbage can on my head.

01:09:13.410 --> 01:09:16.609
No, no, you're gonna get out of the way.
It's gonna land on me.

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:18.620
I'll see ya.

01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:26.350
Come on, Mike. Hey.
Come on, come on, come on.

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:30.390
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry about the money.

01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:32.399
I should've told you.

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:36.660
It's just-- What do you want me to say?
It's fucking embarrassing.

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:39.229
I, like, just get out,
I'm in a big fucking hole.

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:42.300
I need something to get goin'.
I gotta get started.

01:09:42.370 --> 01:09:44.310
And?

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:47.609
Well, I'm not gonna lie.
There's been some reversals.

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:50.716
Some reversals. How
much money do you have?

01:09:51.015 --> 01:09:52.120
Nine hundred.

01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:56.350
I mean, I caught a frozen wave of cards
like you fucking read about.

01:09:56.420 --> 01:10:00.150
I think I'm getting you outta hock,
I find out I'm seven grand in.

01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:03.160
I know, man. I was really--
I was really up big.

01:10:03.230 --> 01:10:05.160
I was cruising along.

01:10:05.230 --> 01:10:08.130
I tried to beat that blackjack game
at the Horseshoe Club in Brooklyn.

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:12.000
- That place is a mitt joint.
- I know. It was, like, ouch. I'm so stupid.

01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:15.200
I got so good with this,
I thought I could neutralize 'em.

01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:17.400
You're really jamming me up
here, man. Seven grand.

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:17.892
I know.

01:10:18.192 --> 01:10:22.140
That's it. I can't go any deeper
than that. You're off the tip.

01:10:22.210 --> 01:10:24.580
- I understand. That's okay.
- And you gotta talk with Grama.

01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:27.640
- You gotta square things away with Grama.
- No way, Mike.

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:29.980
I'm not talking
to that fucking Judas.

01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:31.990
You think
there's any other way?

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:38.690
I know all
the reasons I shouldn't be here,

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:41.460
but sometimes
reasons don't matter.

01:10:41.530 --> 01:10:44.530
You see, no one's
ever stood up for Worm.

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:47.900
The guy's been kicked around
his whole life, from his father on down.

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:53.310
Maybe he's not the same guy
he was when he went away,

01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:56.350
but I can't give up on him
that easy.

01:10:56.410 --> 01:10:58.580
I'm all he's got.

01:10:58.650 --> 01:11:00.880
Oh, what the hell.

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:06.480
- Hi, boys.
- Hi.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:09.460
You cops?
You look like cops.

01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:12.900
- We're not cops.
- You wanna twirl then?

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:15.930
No, no, we're just here
to see Grama.

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:21.970
Jesus.

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:27.600
- You sure about this? I got a bad
feeling. - That's all right.Just--

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:30.980
Just let me do
the talking, all right?

01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:37.410
Hey, Grama.

01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:40.720
- Long time.
- Mike.

01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:44.060
Hey, Worm. It's good you came.
That's real smart thinking.

01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:47.830
So, did you bring him along
to help carry all my money?

01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:49.830
Uh, there's no money today.

01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:52.840
No money?
There's gotta be some money.

01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:55.070
Come on. Get outta here.

01:11:57.340 --> 01:11:59.470
He's not kidding.
I got nothing.

01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:03.410
You owe 25. I'll take
the rest in five days.

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:06.580
- Five grand in a week, and you
keep the juice going-- - Shh. Quiet.

01:12:06.650 --> 01:12:10.180
You gotta catch 'em in the act.

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:16.850
Get in your hole, you bitch!

01:12:16.930 --> 01:12:19.190
- Christ.
- Fucking dog.

01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:23.530
You can't let 'em get away with it
or else they think they run the place.

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:26.800
- So, where were we?
- Five grand.

01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:31.470
In a week. Grama, we want what
you want. We wanna square this thing.

01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:35.310
But three days-- three days
is impossible. All right?

01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:38.680
No one's saying you're not the man.Just
think of this as a business decision.

01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:41.740
Look, he just got out.
Let's put him on a plan.

01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:44.620
No, no, no, no, no.
This isn't The Money Store.

01:12:44.690 --> 01:12:47.320
We're not negotiating here.
I tell you how it works.

01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:48.790
Well, then, I'm asking.

01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:54.990
So, you're looking for a
little grace, Lester, some charity?

01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:58.700
You know what, Grama? I need your fucking
charity like I need your cock in my ass.

01:12:58.770 --> 01:13:01.970
- Shut the fuck up!
- It's too late for him to shut up.

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:04.630
- Hey, listen! He's good for it.
- He's good for it, Mike?

01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:07.140
If you think he's good for it,
it's on you too.

01:13:07.210 --> 01:13:09.150
Then it's on me too.

01:13:09.210 --> 01:13:11.741
Fifteen large, five days,
or I start breaking things.

01:13:12.041 --> 01:13:12.650
I hear ya.

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:15.710
Get the fuck outta here.

01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:17.760
Piece of shit.

01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:20.260
Now, what the hell
are you doing?

01:13:20.330 --> 01:13:22.760
I'm not gonna get down on my knees
for that jerk-off.

01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:25.560
All I said is just keep
your mouth shut for five seconds.

01:13:25.630 --> 01:13:28.390
- Shit. I'm sorry.
- Goddamn it.

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:31.730
That's it.
I'm really sunk now.

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:36.140
No, 15 grand in five days. I can do that.
I've gone on rushes like that before.

01:13:36.210 --> 01:13:40.410
Ah, under optimum conditions
with a bankroll, maybe.

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:43.410
- But what have you got on you?
- Got, like, 350.

01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:46.850
Ah, that's 1 ,200 between us.
We might as well play the fucking Lotto.

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:50.510
No, man, no. Listen. Find the games,
scout 'em out, I sit, I mop 'em up.

01:13:50.590 --> 01:13:52.950
You know, we might have
a shot at this...

01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:55.650
if we sat together
and just did our thing.

01:13:55.730 --> 01:13:58.530
I'm not gonna do that.
I'm gonna do this straight up.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.460
- Oh, fuck, man.
- I mean it.

01:14:00.530 --> 01:14:03.660
- Well, where do you wanna start?
- There's a 30-60 at the Chesterfield.

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:07.030
Come on, listen-- there's the 4:00 a.m.
in Woodside. There's the Greeks.

01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:09.600
All right, there's
a union game in Jersey.

01:14:09.670 --> 01:14:12.610
- I know a guy whose cousin can get us in.
- All right.

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:15.080
- There's four.
- There's a cigar shop in Brooklyn.

01:14:15.150 --> 01:14:16.353
It's like an easy clean.

01:14:16.653 --> 01:14:19.310
There's a golf pro game
in Riverdale. That's six.

01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:21.480
- You sure you're up for this?
- I'm fucking up for this.

01:14:21.550 --> 01:14:23.490
An 80.

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:33.090
I bet the full amount.

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.400
The full amount, huh?
Well, let me look at you here.

01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:41.740
Nope. You didn't do it this time.
I'm gonna raise you.

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:55.850
- I don't know.
- The bet's 50.

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:58.550
I kinda like this robusto.

01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:00.750
A nice, nutty finish.

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:06.260
I love the Cameroon wrapper
on this baby. Nice and oily.

01:15:07.330 --> 01:15:10.790
I'll call.
What do you got?

01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:12.840
I have what's
known as the wheel.

01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:17.140
It's got earthy tones, a smooth draw,
enough kick to win me the Hi and the Lo.

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:20.640
Call.

01:15:20.710 --> 01:15:25.450
- Trip aces.
- I-- I only got a pair.

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:28.350
- Jacks.
- What did you think he had?

01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:31.010
Does he look like a man
beaten by jacks?

01:15:31.090 --> 01:15:34.550
Jacks are a monster compared
to the crap you play, Taki.

01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:38.560
- Ah, fuck you. Fuck you.
- Fuck me? Fuck you!

01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:41.720
It's only money. I bet.

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:44.460
Then let's get some in there.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:48.130
- Make it five.
- You're raising me 300, kid?

01:15:49.710 --> 01:15:51.640
I call your 300.

01:15:51.710 --> 01:15:55.300
- How much is in there, Weitz?
- About 1 ,500. 1 ,500.

01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:58.580
Here's a thousand. There's 500.

01:15:58.650 --> 01:16:00.550
I bet you
the pot limit, kiddo.

01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:02.850
Are you sure on that, Goldie?

01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:06.480
You might want to leave a little something
for your daughter's riding lessons.

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:09.190
There's a lot more
where that came from, Weitz.

01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:14.560
Take it down.

01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:17.190
I got shit.
I bluffed the big ringer.

01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:19.700
Let's go. Let's go.

01:16:19.770 --> 01:16:23.540
Get up. Get off your ass.
We're done. Come on.

01:16:23.610 --> 01:16:26.510
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere--
Oh, by the way, anybody.

01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:29.270
Buy some real jewelry,
you fucking cheap bastard.

01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:30.870
Unbelievable.

01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:33.710
- What were you doing in there?
- I didn't have it.

01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:35.720
You didn't have it?

01:16:35.790 --> 01:16:38.780
Since when you have to have it to
take a pot off a hump like that?

01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:40.537
A grade schooler would've
played back at that guy.

01:16:40.837 --> 01:16:41.790
I was waiting the guy out.

01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:44.800
Eventually, he was going to bluff
at the wrong pot. I was gonna take him.

01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:48.820
We don't have time. That guy was
papier-mache. You gotta make strong moves.

01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:52.700
The move was folding. I can't lose
what I don't put in the middle.

01:16:52.770 --> 01:16:56.670
Oh, Jesus, you know what?
Fuck all that 'cause we needed that pot.

01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:59.070
Well, what
are we up to?

01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:03.980
That's like seven.
Seven.

01:17:04.050 --> 01:17:07.020
With that pot you just dumped
on that fucking V-neck sweater,

01:17:07.090 --> 01:17:09.020
we would've had ten.

01:17:09.090 --> 01:17:12.280
Look at you. One 64-hour session,
and you need a nap.

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:14.790
- No time for a fucking nap.
- No, we don't. That's all right.

01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:17.620
Come on.
I know what you need.

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:20.290
I know-- I got just the place
for you. Yeah, yeah.

01:17:29.570 --> 01:17:33.310
Feel like I'm gonna get whacked
sitting here like this.

01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:40.940
We got 7,300, Mike.
We gotta double that in two days.

01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:45.460
Well, we're gonna get close. I'm sure
if we come up a little short, Grama--

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:47.960
We come up
even a little short,

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:50.960
Grama will shoot us and bury us
in a hole somewhere.

01:17:52.530 --> 01:17:55.160
Now, I know this game
up in Binghamton.

01:17:55.230 --> 01:17:57.430
- In Binghamton?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:02.570
It's like 16 or 17 guys.
Two full tables. All municipal workers.

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:06.630
They come play right after
they get their paychecks. It's very fat.

01:18:06.710 --> 01:18:10.340
Are you sure? Binghamton's
five hours each way.

01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:15.010
Well, look, I figure there's
15 or 20 grand in that room, okay?

01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:18.720
If we get even half of that,
we're home.

01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:20.720
Lead me to it.

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:36.300
- Municipal workers, huh?
- What? These guys work for the city.

01:18:36.370 --> 01:18:38.740
They work for the state,
you idiot.

01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:42.010
Oh, this is
just stupid.

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:44.980
Look, we're here, okay?

01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:46.254
You got any better ideas?

01:18:46.554 --> 01:18:49.250
How the hell am I supposed
to even get in this game?

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:53.420
No, it's easy. The whole time I was in the
joint, I was just dumping money to guards.

01:18:53.490 --> 01:18:57.990
This one guy, Pete Frye, I probably lost
like ten grand over 18 months.

01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:00.530
I mean, he thinks
I'm a total fish.

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:03.690
He told me anytime I wanted a game
when I got out, just look up his nephew.

01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:07.400
You just go in there,
you ask for Sean Frye, you're in.

01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:10.700
You're gonna clean this game up.
These guys are total suckers.

01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:13.210
All right. Give me,
like, eight hours.

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:16.870
- Come back at 7:00, 7:30.
- What am I gonna do for eight hours?

01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:20.245
Why don't I come in?
I'll sit for a little while.

01:19:20.545 --> 01:19:20.940
No.

01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:22.017
No, not a chance.

01:19:22.317 --> 01:19:25.250
I'll sit at the other
table and play straight.

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:29.050
You wanna play straight? You go
in there, I'll be back in eight hours.

01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:33.060
Aw, Jesus.

01:19:33.130 --> 01:19:36.570
All right, all right. I'll go find
a fucking bowling alley.

01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:38.260
I don't know.

01:19:42.610 --> 01:19:44.540
Excuse me.

01:19:44.610 --> 01:19:48.670
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm looking for Sean Frye.

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:54.020
Yeah, right over there
in that cap.

01:19:54.090 --> 01:19:56.020
Thanks.

01:20:01.190 --> 01:20:03.130
Let's go.

01:20:03.190 --> 01:20:05.250
- Sean Frye?
- That's right.

01:20:05.330 --> 01:20:09.100
Yeah, your Uncle Pete told me
to come by if I ever was around here.

01:20:09.170 --> 01:20:11.360
You one
of his students?

01:20:13.470 --> 01:20:17.100
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I-- I wasn't inside.

01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:20.440
- You know him from hunting then, huh?
- Yeah, yeah, actually.

01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:24.170
I met him over at, uh-- He took me
for like a grand over at the lodge.

01:20:24.250 --> 01:20:27.910
Well, that's the buy-in here.
We play 20-40 Stud.

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:30.420
- Grab a seat.
- Great.

01:20:39.930 --> 01:20:42.370
- How you doing? I'm Mike.
- How you doing? Vitter.

01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:45.100
- Osborne. - Hi.
- This is Whitley.

01:20:45.170 --> 01:20:47.100
Bet 40.

01:20:47.170 --> 01:20:49.540
Back at ya.

01:20:49.610 --> 01:20:53.070
- All right.
- You and me, Mike.

01:20:54.650 --> 01:20:56.580
Another 40.

01:20:56.650 --> 01:20:59.740
All right,
40 it is.

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:03.450
- Flush.
- Mm.

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:07.290
Generally, the rule is, the nicer
the guy, the poorer the card player.

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:10.790
And these guys, despite being cops,
are real sweethearts.

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:14.960
I'm right on schedule,
up 4,200.

01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:18.990
The morning can't get here soon enough.

01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:21.970
Holy shit! That's a hell of an elk.

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:24.700
My grandfather got that one.
Ain't that a beauty?

01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:26.830
- Hey, fellas.
- Hey, Bear!

01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:30.140
Met this guy down at the bowling alley.
Says he likes to play cards.

01:21:30.210 --> 01:21:33.550
Well, you've come to the right place.

01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:36.180
This is Whitley. Osborne.
This guy's name is Mike.

01:21:36.250 --> 01:21:38.810
- Mike? How are ya? Les Murphy.
- This is Vitter.

01:21:38.890 --> 01:21:41.220
- So, what are you guys playing?
- 20-40 Stud.

01:21:41.290 --> 01:21:43.230
Okay.
Deal me in.

01:21:43.290 --> 01:21:45.660
All right,
your money's good here.

01:21:45.730 --> 01:21:48.760
Give him some chips,
start playing some cards.

01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:55.570
Everybody ante.

01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:02.770
Let's play some cards.

01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:17.560
- Ace high bets.
- Well, I like what I have.

01:22:17.630 --> 01:22:19.720
The bet is 20.

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:22.130
I know that look.
I'm gonna fold.

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:25.640
Fold too.

01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:27.640
I'll take it.

01:22:29.710 --> 01:22:32.730
- Yeah, everybody ready? Fourth Street.
- Yes, sir.

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:41.220
Raise you.

01:22:41.290 --> 01:22:45.280
- I'm in.
- Wow. Wow. A lot of action.

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:49.590
A lot of action.

01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:56.260
- I got the flush.
- Show me. What you got in here?

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:02.340
- Jesus. Who wants more?
- I'm in.

01:23:02.410 --> 01:23:04.640
- I'm in.
- Come on, come on.

01:23:04.710 --> 01:23:07.180
I'm staging
a late-night comeback here.

01:23:08.810 --> 01:23:11.110
Late-night rally.

01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:15.310
Okay? Just to--
Just to warn you.

01:23:16.890 --> 01:23:18.680
Ace high bets.

01:23:21.690 --> 01:23:23.490
Uh, ace checks.

01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:27.500
- Check.
- Check on an ace. All right. I'll check.

01:23:27.570 --> 01:23:29.500
- Check.
- Check.

01:23:29.570 --> 01:23:32.090
All right, free card.
Here we go.

01:23:32.170 --> 01:23:34.760
- Hold on there a fucking second.
- Easy. What are you doing?

01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:38.040
- Give me the deck.
- Relax, man. Don't get so agitated.

01:23:38.110 --> 01:23:41.480
Looks like we got a road gang here.
- A what?

01:23:41.550 --> 01:23:45.540
- What are you-- What? - What the
hell's going on over here, Stu?

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:47.710
This son of a bitch
is base dealing.

01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:50.480
- Caught a hanger, Sarge.
- What? A hanger?

01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:52.990
I don't even know
what you're saying.

01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:55.749
He's saying you're dealing
off the bottom of the deck.

01:23:56.049 --> 01:23:57.320
Oh, God. Come on, guys.

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.760
- What did he give him?
- To me?

01:23:59.830 --> 01:24:04.290
- Seven of hearts.
- You boys professionals? You working?

01:24:04.370 --> 01:24:06.560
I was winning
before this guy got here.

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:09.230
Okay, okay. Let's let the cards
do the talking.

01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:12.400
If the seven didn't help you,
we'll listen to what you have to say.

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:15.210
Ozzy, turn the cards.

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:17.750
Come on! It's three of a kind!

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:20.750
- Shut up!
- I'm just sayin', it's three of a kind.

01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:23.150
One last thing, Stu.

01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:26.390
Scumbag!

01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:28.390
Hey, all right,
take it easy.

01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:30.860
Aren't you supposed
to read us our rights?

01:24:30.930 --> 01:24:32.690
Here's your fuckin' rights!

01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:38.530
Fuck you!

01:24:51.150 --> 01:24:56.380
Get the fuck outta here,
you cocksuckers! Shit!

01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:00.280
Aw, Jesus!

01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:04.560
Worm.

01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:08.970
Worm?

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:13.470
Hey, Les.

01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:15.470
Hey.

01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:18.100
Hey, you all right?

01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:20.110
Mike?

01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:22.110
Yeah.

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:26.120
You should've played
those kings, Mike.

01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:29.020
Aw, you're an asshole.

01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:32.990
I know. I know.
I'm sorry.

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:36.650
They took
every fucking nickel.

01:25:36.730 --> 01:25:40.320
I think I got 300
in my boot somewhere.

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:45.030
Oh, look at you.
Fuck!

01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:47.970
Fuck, I cannot believe
I caught a hanger.

01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:52.840
- Aw, it's never happened, I swear to God.
- Where's the car?

01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:56.110
- God, I think I cracked a rib.
- What the fuck were you thinking?

01:25:56.180 --> 01:25:59.340
- I was trying to give us an edge.
- I had 'em.

01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:01.890
Hey, I'm sorry
we got banged up, all right?

01:26:01.950 --> 01:26:04.390
I took a shot and I missed.
That happens.

01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:08.120
- Fucking happens all the time around you.
- What, it doesn't happen to you?

01:26:08.190 --> 01:26:11.390
You're the guy who flushed his whole
fucking bankroll on one hand, Mike.

01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:13.716
Oh, hey, fuck you,
man. That was different.

01:26:14.016 --> 01:26:15.400
Why? Explain that to me.

01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:18.560
Why different, huh?
What makes you so fucking special?

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:20.930
How come all your moves
are so smart and noble...

01:26:21.010 --> 01:26:23.370
and I'm always
the idiot piece of shit?

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:26.170
You act like you're the only one
with any fucking ambition.

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:29.800
What's your ambition, man? Tell me.
I don't know. What is it?

01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:32.133
I don't even know. I
don't think like that.

01:26:32.433 --> 01:26:33.610
No, you don't think.

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:35.620
No, I don't think
like you!

01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:38.620
You always think you can beat the game
straight up. That's not me.

01:26:38.690 --> 01:26:40.592
I told you, I'm always gonna
look for that edge. Always.

01:26:40.892 --> 01:26:41.660
What's the edge now?

01:26:41.730 --> 01:26:44.160
We owe 15 grand in a day.
What do we do?

01:26:44.230 --> 01:26:47.060
It's easy. We get
the fuck outta Dodge, all right?

01:26:47.130 --> 01:26:49.960
We just steer clear
of the city for a while.

01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:53.370
We'll hit the road. We'll be up again
in no time. This'll all blow over.

01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:54.073
We'll have a ball.

01:26:54.373 --> 01:26:56.130
Not a fucking chance
I'm gonna live like that.

01:26:56.210 --> 01:26:58.898
You talk to Grama.
You get him to stake me.

01:26:59.198 --> 01:27:00.970
It's not gonna work, okay?

01:27:01.050 --> 01:27:03.640
We're not dealing with Grama.

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:08.310
You said
Grama's on his own.

01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:12.120
- You told me Grama's on his own.
- KGB bankrolled him.

01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:18.390
- So you've just fucked us right in the ass.
- Yeah, all the way, okay?

01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:22.490
So you see what I'm saying?
No fooling around. It's highway time.

01:27:22.570 --> 01:27:25.970
Are you with me or not?

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:28.330
No, I'm not this time.

01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:39.510
- Give me the keys.
- You're really gonna go back there?

01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:42.880
Yeah.

01:27:44.150 --> 01:27:47.120
I'll see you
when I see you.

01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:53.030
Hey. At least you're
rounding again, right?

01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:56.460
You're gonna thank me
for that someday.

01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:11.010
Fold or hang tough.
Call or raise the bet.

01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:14.180
These are decisions
you make at the table.

01:28:14.250 --> 01:28:17.780
Sometimes the odds are stacked so clear,
there's only one way to play it.

01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:21.920
Other times, like holding a small pair
against two over cards,

01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:24.620
it's six to five,
or even money, either way.

01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:28.260
Then it's all about feel,
what's in your guts.

01:28:29.330 --> 01:28:31.300
Well, look at you.

01:28:31.370 --> 01:28:33.670
Look at me.

01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:35.760
Come in.

01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:37.770
No.

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:42.300
- Where's your friend?
- Uh, he's gone.

01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:46.320
- He's gone.
- So you brought my money?

01:28:47.890 --> 01:28:51.950
- I'm a little short.
- How short?

01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:53.790
The whole way.

01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:56.920
There must be
some kind of story.

01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:00.690
Well...

01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:04.260
as you can see,
I can't pay you.

01:29:04.340 --> 01:29:07.100
I see you're
banged up pretty good.

01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:14.610
You never should've vouched
for that scumbag.

01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:19.680
Maybe not.

01:29:21.250 --> 01:29:24.650
- You're leaving me no outs here.
- Why?

01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:28.280
I can't trust you two
aren't playing me.

01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:30.850
I'm not the one
working with a partner here.

01:29:32.930 --> 01:29:37.200
You wanna take it up with KGB,
you go right ahead.

01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:42.800
Otherwise, you got one day,
or this'll feel like a Swedish massage.

01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:02.250
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:16.570
You look like Duane Bobick
after one round with Norton.

01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:21.580
- What the fuck happened to you?
- Ah, Worm.

01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:24.880
When are you
gonna listen?

01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:27.420
I'm listening.

01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:31.280
What do you need?
500? A grand?

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:33.950
- Huh?
- I need-- I need 15,000.

01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:36.580
- Fifteen?
- Yep.

01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:39.750
I need a blow job
from Christy Turlington.

01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:43.430
- Get the fuck outta here. $15,000?
- Seriously, Joey.

01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:47.440
What can you do for me? Five hundred
dollars is not even gonna get me started.

01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:52.310
Goddamn it, Mike, if 500 won't
help, what's two grand gonna do?

01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:56.440
What kind of trouble
you in?

01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:59.570
I'm in the worst kind,
with the worst guy.

01:30:59.650 --> 01:31:01.740
- KGB?
- Yep.

01:31:03.820 --> 01:31:05.760
Come here.

01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:09.590
Didn't I tell you...

01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:12.560
to never let that guy
get a hold of you?

01:31:12.630 --> 01:31:16.000
- You told me a lot of things.
- Yeah, yeah. And you don't listen.

01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:19.000
I tell you to play within your means,
you risk your whole bankroll.

01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:21.560
I tell you not to
overextend yourself, to rebuild,

01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:24.040
you go into hock for more.

01:31:24.110 --> 01:31:26.670
I was giving you
a living, Mike,

01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:30.180
showing you the playbook
I put together off my own beats.

01:31:30.250 --> 01:31:32.180
That wasn't enough
for you--

01:31:32.250 --> 01:31:36.120
This is one time I don't need
you to tell me how I fucked up.

01:31:36.190 --> 01:31:38.120
I know I fucked up.

01:31:38.190 --> 01:31:41.160
What I need from you
is money.

01:31:41.230 --> 01:31:44.130
- I need whatever money you can give me.
- See, that's the thing.

01:31:44.190 --> 01:31:46.790
This time
there is no money.

01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:50.360
I give you two grand,
what's that buy you? A day?

01:31:50.430 --> 01:31:52.630
No, I give it to you,
I'm wasting it.

01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:55.470
- That's fucking great.
- You did it to yourself.

01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:58.470
You had to put it all on the line
for some Vegas pipe dream.

01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:00.570
Yeah, I took a risk.
I took a risk.

01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:03.140
You see all the angles.
You never have the stones to play one.

01:32:03.210 --> 01:32:07.010
"Stones"?
You little punk.

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:09.920
I'm not playing for the thrill
of fucking victory here.

01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:15.250
I owe rent, alimony, child support.
I play for money.

01:32:15.330 --> 01:32:17.260
My kids eat.

01:32:17.330 --> 01:32:19.800
I got stones enough
not to chase cards, action...

01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:23.660
or fucking pipe dreams
of winning the World Series on ESPN.

01:32:23.730 --> 01:32:26.360
You want me to, uh,
call some people,

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:28.600
try and buy you
some time, I will.

01:32:28.670 --> 01:32:31.160
Place to stay, or the truck.
No problem.

01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:35.610
But about the money,
I gotta do this. I gotta say no.

01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:39.270
That's fine.
I understand.

01:32:42.490 --> 01:32:45.080
- Hey, listen.
- What?

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:47.750
I put it all on the line.
That's true.

01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:51.490
And you know what?
It wasn't a bad beat.

01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:53.550
I wasn't unlucky.

01:32:53.630 --> 01:32:56.460
I got outplayed.
I got outplayed that time.

01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:01.060
But I know I'm good enough
to sit at that table.

01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:03.610
It's not-- It's not
a fucking pipe dream.

01:33:03.670 --> 01:33:06.140
I don't doubt your talent.

01:33:06.210 --> 01:33:09.240
I never--
I never told anybody this.

01:33:09.310 --> 01:33:13.410
About eight, nine months ago,
I'm at the Taj, it's late,

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:15.510
and I see Johnny Chan
walk in.

01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:17.520
And he goes,
he sits 300-600.

01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:20.420
And the whole place stops
when Johnny Chan walks in.

01:33:20.490 --> 01:33:22.580
Everybody puts
an eye on him.

01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:25.090
After a little while,
there wasn't a crap game going...

01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:27.600
'cause all the high rollers
are over there watching him.

01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:30.500
Some are playing with him, giving
away their money to this guy to say...

01:33:30.570 --> 01:33:32.500
"Oh, I played
with the World Champion."

01:33:32.570 --> 01:33:35.500
And you know what I did?
I sat down.

01:33:35.570 --> 01:33:39.270
Nah, you need 50, 60 grand
to play right in that game.

01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:41.830
Well, I had six,
but I had to know.

01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:43.850
What happened?

01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:47.180
Played tight for an hour. I folded
mostly, and then I made a score.

01:33:47.250 --> 01:33:50.620
- Wired aces or kings?
- Rags.

01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:55.410
I had nothing.
But he raised.

01:33:55.490 --> 01:33:58.090
And I just decided, you know,
I don't care about the money.

01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:00.430
I'm just gonna
outplay the guy.

01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:03.160
I'm just gonna outplay
this guy this hand.

01:34:03.230 --> 01:34:05.930
- I re-raised.
- Re-raise.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.770
- You played right back at him, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:11.330
And he just comes right
back over the top of me,

01:34:11.410 --> 01:34:13.930
trying to bully me like
I'm some fucking tourist.

01:34:14.010 --> 01:34:15.950
I hesitate for two seconds.
I re-raised.

01:34:16.010 --> 01:34:18.980
And he makes a move toward his checks,
and he looks at me.

01:34:19.050 --> 01:34:22.490
And he looks at his cards,
and he looks at me again.

01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:25.780
And he mucked it.
I took it down.

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:30.730
"Did you have it?"
"I'm sorry, John. I don't remember."

01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:35.400
I got up, and I walked
to the cashier.

01:34:35.470 --> 01:34:39.030
I sat with the best
in the world, and I won.

01:34:39.100 --> 01:34:42.970
You put a fucking move on Chan,
you son of a bitch.

01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:46.170
So that's why you made
that run on KGB's place.

01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:48.680
That's right.

01:34:48.750 --> 01:34:51.410
And I'll do it again
if I can.

01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:55.520
Well, then I'm rooting
for you, Mike.

01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:58.550
I'll see you around,
Knish.

01:35:00.090 --> 01:35:04.120
This is temporary?
Will you be back next semester?

01:35:04.190 --> 01:35:07.430
Oh, I think we
both know I'm no lawyer.

01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:11.470
I hope my story
didn't discourage you.

01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:16.560
No. It inspired me.
I think I was on my way out anyway.

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:19.670
- But now you're here.
- That's right.

01:35:19.740 --> 01:35:23.340
- You're in trouble?
- Yes, sir, I am.

01:35:23.410 --> 01:35:28.250
Uh, not with the law.
I owe.

01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:32.190
- A gambling debt?
- Yeah.

01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:37.250
It's not mine. It's, uh--
I vouched for the wrong guy.

01:35:37.330 --> 01:35:40.090
Um, so now it's on me.

01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:42.100
I understand.

01:35:44.170 --> 01:35:47.190
So, what will it take
for you to be free of this?

01:35:49.370 --> 01:35:52.540
- I need 15,000 tonight.
- Michael!

01:35:52.610 --> 01:35:55.370
Michael!

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:02.380
- You know, I'm not a wealthy man, Michael.
- I know.

01:36:02.450 --> 01:36:05.850
And it kills me
to ask you, but...

01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:08.720
I don't have
any other play here.

01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:11.960
So, uh, if you can
help me at all--

01:36:12.030 --> 01:36:14.090
I hate to see you
like this.

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:16.600
I want to help you, Michael.
But $15,000, I-- I--

01:36:16.670 --> 01:36:18.530
I know.

01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:27.300
If it must be tonight,

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:31.910
then ten
is the best I can do.

01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:35.580
Would you do that?

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:43.150
When my mother
let me leave the yeshiva,

01:36:43.230 --> 01:36:45.990
it nearly broke her.

01:36:46.060 --> 01:36:50.300
But she knew--
She knew the life I had to lead.

01:36:52.370 --> 01:36:55.130
To do that for another
is a mitzvah.

01:36:58.010 --> 01:37:01.410
And for that, I owe.

01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:19.190
So you take this money...

01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:22.230
and you get yourself
out of this trouble.

01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:24.230
You hear me?

01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:31.670
I know you can.

01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:38.680
I-- I promise that I'm gonna--
I'll pay you back.

01:37:39.750 --> 01:37:41.680
Good luck.

01:38:03.810 --> 01:38:07.640
I've often seen these people,
these squares, at the table.

01:38:07.710 --> 01:38:11.880
Short-stacked and long odds against,
all their outs gone,

01:38:11.950 --> 01:38:14.640
one last card in the deck
that can help them.

01:38:16.350 --> 01:38:20.720
I used to wonder how they could let
themselves get into such bad shape...

01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:23.990
and how the hell they thought
they could turn it around.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.490
Just walking in here
makes me queasy.

01:38:33.570 --> 01:38:36.700
The brick walls.
The fucking mopes at the tables.

01:38:36.770 --> 01:38:40.970
The musty smell. I feel like Buckner
walking back into Shea.

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:43.540
But what choice do I have?

01:38:43.610 --> 01:38:46.450
So, you have my money?

01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:49.420
- I owe you that money tomorrow, right?
- Da.

01:38:50.990 --> 01:38:53.110
So it's still mine.

01:38:53.190 --> 01:38:58.220
For the next eight hours,
it is yours.

01:38:58.300 --> 01:39:01.630
But if you
don't have it all by then,

01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:04.460
then you are mine.

01:39:04.530 --> 01:39:06.470
Well...

01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:16.110
I got $10,000.
I'm looking for a game.

01:39:17.310 --> 01:39:20.440
- You sure?
- You heard me.

01:39:24.050 --> 01:39:27.250
So, we'll play. Heads up.

01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:30.520
We both start
with a couple of racks.

01:39:30.590 --> 01:39:34.330
Blinds, uh, 25 and 50?

01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:39.060
And we don't stop
until one of us has it all.

01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:44.000
Let's do it.

01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:11.660
I'm gonna raise.

01:40:11.740 --> 01:40:13.790
Thousand straight.

01:40:13.870 --> 01:40:16.360
Very aggressive.

01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:19.170
A new day.

01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:23.040
And you won't be pushed around.

01:40:23.110 --> 01:40:26.840
But... I re-raise.

01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:30.720
Five thousand.

01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:35.660
Doyle Brunson says,
"The key to No-Limit...

01:40:35.730 --> 01:40:38.460
is to put a man to a decision
for all his chips."

01:40:38.530 --> 01:40:40.460
Teddy's just done it.

01:40:40.530 --> 01:40:43.690
He's representing aces,
the only hand better than my cowboys.

01:40:43.770 --> 01:40:46.500
I can't call and give him
a chance to catch.

01:40:46.570 --> 01:40:49.660
I can only fold,
if I believe him. Or--

01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:52.140
I re-raise. I'm all in.

01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:24.830
Take it down.

01:41:32.780 --> 01:41:34.720
In a heads-up match,

01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:38.950
the size of your stack is almost as
important as the quality of your cards.

01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:41.620
I chopped one of his legs out
in the first hand.

01:41:41.690 --> 01:41:45.145
Now all I have to do is lean
on him until he falls over.

01:41:45.445 --> 01:41:45.990
Check.

01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:48.530
Bet a thousand.

01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:51.620
Call. I'll call.

01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:57.100
Check.

01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:02.300
What's that, 2,500 there?
I'm gonna tap your tap.

01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:13.460
Jacks up.

01:42:15.890 --> 01:42:17.830
Very good.

01:42:19.530 --> 01:42:21.830
Good hand.

01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:26.300
Catching that Jack
on the turn.

01:42:26.370 --> 01:42:31.000
- You got lucky there.
- Yep, it was luck.

01:42:31.070 --> 01:42:35.070
So, that's it then, hmm?

01:42:35.150 --> 01:42:40.170
Just like a young man
coming in for a quickie.

01:42:40.250 --> 01:42:45.020
I feel so unsatisfied.

01:42:45.090 --> 01:42:47.020
I'm sorry.

01:42:47.090 --> 01:42:50.820
You must feel proud
and good.

01:42:50.890 --> 01:42:53.990
Strong enough
to beat the world.

01:42:55.570 --> 01:43:00.230
- I feel fine.
- Me too. I feel okay.

01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:05.270
'Course maybe we check
with one other guy, see how he feels.

01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:07.940
Grama!

01:43:10.850 --> 01:43:13.280
I thought I smelled him.

01:43:13.350 --> 01:43:15.720
I'll take what's ours.

01:43:15.790 --> 01:43:18.650
'Course you could
let it ride, Mike.

01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:21.780
Take your chances.
You could let this happen, Grama?

01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:23.880
Sure, partner.

01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:27.160
He still has till morning
to make good.

01:43:27.230 --> 01:43:32.690
Uh, you know what? I got my
five grand here. That's just fine by me.

01:43:32.770 --> 01:43:36.000
- I'm going home.
- Fine.

01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:38.400
It's a fucking joke anyway.

01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:43.140
After all, I am paying you
with your money.

01:43:46.050 --> 01:43:49.450
- What did you say?
- Your money.

01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:52.960
I am still up 20 grand...

01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:56.580
from this last time
I stick it in you.

01:43:56.660 --> 01:44:00.860
They're trying
to goad me, trying to own me.

01:44:00.930 --> 01:44:06.030
But this isn't a gunfight. It's not
about pride or ego. It's only about money.

01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:09.800
I can leave now,
even with Grama and KGB...

01:44:09.870 --> 01:44:13.330
and halfway
to paying Petrovsky back.

01:44:13.410 --> 01:44:15.340
That's the safe play.

01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:19.110
I told Worm you can't lose
what you don't put in the middle.

01:44:19.180 --> 01:44:23.020
- Deal 'em.
- But you can't win much either.

01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:27.280
Checks!

01:44:29.190 --> 01:44:33.150
- Double the blinds?
- Yeah.

01:44:33.230 --> 01:44:35.360
Table stakes.

01:44:35.430 --> 01:44:38.960
Good. Feel free
to reload at any time.

01:44:55.150 --> 01:44:58.680
You must
be kicking yourself...

01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:02.890
for not walking out
when you could.

01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:07.400
Bad judgment.

01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:09.660
But...

01:45:09.730 --> 01:45:12.100
don't you worry, son.

01:45:12.170 --> 01:45:16.160
It will all be over soon.

01:45:21.580 --> 01:45:23.240
Okay.

01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:49.510
Check.

01:45:51.070 --> 01:45:54.640
No check here.
I tap you.

01:46:09.460 --> 01:46:11.790
I'm laying
this down, Teddy.

01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:15.700
Top two pair.

01:46:15.770 --> 01:46:19.260
It's a monster hand,
and I'm gonna lay that down...

01:46:19.340 --> 01:46:23.290
'cause you got two-four, and I'm
not gonna draw against a made hand.

01:46:28.510 --> 01:46:32.310
Lays down a monster.

01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:40.820
Should have paid me off
on that.

01:46:43.290 --> 01:46:46.820
Why the fuck did you
lay that down?

01:47:02.250 --> 01:47:05.740
Wow.
Not hungry?

01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:09.010
Mr. Son of a Bitch.

01:47:09.090 --> 01:47:12.450
Let's play some cards.

01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:14.460
The rule is this:

01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:17.820
You spot a man's tell,
you don't say a fucking word.

01:47:17.890 --> 01:47:19.830
I finally spotted KGB's.

01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:24.200
And usually I would've let him go on
chewing those Oreos till he was dead broke.

01:47:24.270 --> 01:47:29.070
But I don't have that kind of time.
I've only got till morning.

01:47:29.140 --> 01:47:33.510
Not even Teddy KGB's immune
to getting a little rattled.

01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:37.340
Enough is enough, Teddy.
Finish the fucking kid off.

01:47:37.410 --> 01:47:40.380
Hanging around.
Hanging around.

01:47:40.450 --> 01:47:45.220
Kid's got alligator blood.
Can't get rid of him.

01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:51.160
No, I'm not going anywhere.
Double the blind.

01:47:51.230 --> 01:47:53.820
Okay.

01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:55.630
I call.

01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:06.810
Check.

01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:20.950
Two grand.

01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:26.690
All right, I'll call the two grand.
I'll gamble.

01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:29.160
Don't splash the pot.

01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:34.200
You're on a draw, Mike?
Go away.

01:48:34.270 --> 01:48:36.600
This one
is not good for you.

01:48:36.670 --> 01:48:42.110
And in my club, I will splash the pot
whenever the fuck I please.

01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:44.270
Okay.

01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:54.110
I'm gonna check, Teddy.

01:48:55.690 --> 01:48:57.630
That's right.

01:48:57.690 --> 01:49:02.130
Big daddy...

01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:05.030
bets...

01:49:05.100 --> 01:49:07.570
the pot.

01:49:11.370 --> 01:49:13.310
That's 4,400.

01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:16.740
All right, I'm gonna call you, or else
I won't respect myself tomorrow morning.

01:49:16.810 --> 01:49:20.510
Respect is all you'll have left
in the morning.

01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:26.150
Last card coming.

01:49:36.430 --> 01:49:38.590
Check.

01:49:38.670 --> 01:49:42.200
It hurts, doesn't it?

01:49:42.270 --> 01:49:46.470
You can't believe
what fell.

01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:50.030
All your dreams... dashed.

01:49:50.110 --> 01:49:54.170
Hopes down
the fucking drain.

01:49:54.250 --> 01:49:58.550
Your fate, he is sitting
right beside you.

01:49:58.620 --> 01:50:01.520
That ace could not
have helped you.

01:50:03.930 --> 01:50:08.230
I bet it all.

01:50:13.700 --> 01:50:17.300
You're right, Teddy.
The ace didn't help me.

01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:21.940
I flopped
a nut straight.

01:50:23.710 --> 01:50:27.080
Motherfucker!

01:50:27.150 --> 01:50:30.740
- Motherfucker! That is it!
- That's it?

01:50:30.820 --> 01:50:32.750
What the fuck
you talking about?

01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:35.090
- Take him down, Teddy.
- Nyet! Nyet! No more!

01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:37.490
No! Not tonight!

01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:42.290
This son of bitch,
all night he check, check, check.

01:50:42.370 --> 01:50:44.300
He trapped me!

01:50:44.370 --> 01:50:46.960
Well, you feeling
satisfied now, Teddy?

01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:50.130
'Cause I can go on
busting you up all night.

01:50:50.210 --> 01:50:52.830
Nyet! Nyet!

01:50:58.150 --> 01:51:01.740
He beat me.
Straight up.

01:51:02.820 --> 01:51:04.750
Pay him.

01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:08.750
Pay that man his money.

01:51:50.630 --> 01:51:54.160
Turned my ten grand
into just over 60.

01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:57.830
Paid 15 to Grama, six went back
to the Chesterfield.

01:51:57.910 --> 01:52:01.400
As for Worm,
well, I figure we're even.

01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:04.540
And after the ten going back
to the professor,

01:52:04.610 --> 01:52:09.450
I'm back where I started,
with three stacks of high society.

01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:20.500
Hey.

01:52:22.570 --> 01:52:27.830
- You look like hell.
- Ah, well, you should've seen me yesterday.

01:52:29.910 --> 01:52:33.140
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. You?

01:52:34.740 --> 01:52:36.870
Now I am.

01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:43.610
So, you're
outta here, huh?

01:52:43.690 --> 01:52:49.390
Yeah, I'm-- I figure
there's nothing left for me here.

01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:53.360
Listen, um, will you
give this to Petrovsky?

01:52:53.430 --> 01:52:57.460
I... didn't want to wake him up.
It's still a little early.

01:52:57.530 --> 01:53:00.560
Can I count on you
to do that?

01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:03.700
You could always count
on me, Mike.

01:53:05.310 --> 01:53:07.240
Thanks.

01:53:07.310 --> 01:53:09.610
Take care, Jo.

01:53:11.180 --> 01:53:15.120
Hey. Call me.

01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:18.450
If you need a lawyer.

01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:21.050
I will.

01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:23.920
And I will.

01:53:42.750 --> 01:53:44.680
Kennedy Airport.

01:53:53.720 --> 01:53:57.820
- So, where you headed?
- I'm going to Vegas.

01:53:57.890 --> 01:54:00.260
- Vegas, huh?
- Yeah.

01:54:00.330 --> 01:54:02.260
Good luck, man.

01:54:02.330 --> 01:54:05.460
People insist on calling it luck.

01:54:05.530 --> 01:54:07.470
Thanks.

01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:13.870
First prize at the World Series
of Poker is a million bucks.

01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:17.380
Does it have my name on it?
I don't know.

01:54:17.450 --> 01:54:19.710
But I'm gonna find out.
