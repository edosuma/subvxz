01:28.188 --> 01:29.289
Okay.

02:16.536 --> 02:17.903
Whoo! Upsy-daisy!

02:17.904 --> 02:19.439
Up, up, baby! Yeah.

02:21.674 --> 02:23.642
Come on, baby! Here we go!

02:23.643 --> 02:26.146
Yeah! Whoo!

02:26.613 --> 02:27.913
Fight for that air, baby!

02:27.914 --> 02:29.916
Fight for that air, baby!

03:08.555 --> 03:10.790
Whoo! Yeah!

03:37.350 --> 03:39.251
Remember when your mother
used to bring us here?

03:39.252 --> 03:40.619
Ages ago.

03:40.620 --> 03:42.889
Every single summer for a week.

03:44.290 --> 03:45.290
Till...

03:45.825 --> 03:46.926
Till Dad passed.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.496
I'm sorry. I didn't...

03:54.334 --> 03:55.501
What are you laughing at?

03:57.003 --> 03:59.739
Remember our first skinny
dip in the midnight moon?

04:00.340 --> 04:02.809
We couldn't find our clothes
when we came back to shore!

04:03.343 --> 04:07.312
I was freaking out, thinking
some maniac stole them.

04:07.313 --> 04:09.715
Of course I remember. I was the
one that had to walk home naked.

04:09.716 --> 04:11.917
And Mom was furious!

04:11.918 --> 04:14.519
Yeah, but we were the ones that
stayed in the freezing water

04:14.520 --> 04:15.722
until you got back.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.552
Hey, Mom! Yeah. We
just pulled up.

04:48.354 --> 04:50.489
No. We haven't been
inside yet, but, uh,

04:50.490 --> 04:52.292
everything looks fine.

04:53.526 --> 04:55.928
Sure. I'll call you in a bit.
Just give us the time to...

04:57.530 --> 04:58.698
I will.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.434
Okay. Love you, too. Bye.

05:01.768 --> 05:03.636
Mom.

05:43.476 --> 05:44.877
Let's go get our bags.

06:24.617 --> 06:27.153
Everything is exactly
the way I remember it.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.555
All right. Pick your room.

06:36.829 --> 06:37.829
Hm.

06:48.007 --> 06:49.475
Ohh!

06:50.810 --> 06:53.045
This is the best
room in the house.

06:53.946 --> 06:56.616
Oh, my God! It's just so cozy!

06:58.618 --> 07:00.153
Oh, I miss this smell! Oh!

07:30.082 --> 07:31.183
Hey.

07:31.184 --> 07:34.020
Whoo! I wasn't sure that's
where it was going.

07:34.620 --> 07:35.655
Yeah.

07:37.857 --> 07:39.892
Let's see a trick.

07:49.235 --> 07:51.103
Lory? You need anything?

07:54.040 --> 07:55.975
I hope this isn't
too hard on you.

07:59.645 --> 08:00.846
The pleasure of having you here

08:00.847 --> 08:03.049
is stronger than... any regret.

08:05.084 --> 08:06.219
Thanks.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.212
This was a beautiful
way to say goodbye.

08:12.558 --> 08:13.559
Who is it?

08:13.860 --> 08:14.961
David.

08:16.095 --> 08:17.964
Jim's nephew.
Caretaker's my uncle.

08:20.266 --> 08:21.567
Hey.

08:22.602 --> 08:23.736
Where's Jim?

08:23.970 --> 08:25.571
He's resting. He caught a cold.

08:25.972 --> 08:27.573
Oh. I'll stop by in the morning.

08:27.840 --> 08:28.840
Anytime.

08:30.576 --> 08:31.776
Hey, you ladies need anything?

08:31.777 --> 08:33.044
We're fine. Thank you.

08:33.779 --> 08:35.547
Tell Jim I'll be
here until Sunday.

08:35.548 --> 08:36.716
Right.

08:37.015 --> 08:38.336
Are you expecting
any more guests?

08:39.184 --> 08:40.953
No. Goodnight.

08:41.988 --> 08:43.089
Goodnight.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.647
Mm.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.783
Connection always
sucked around here.

09:11.717 --> 09:12.919
Lory, stop it.

09:16.756 --> 09:19.156
There hasn't been any crime in
this area since I can remember.

09:19.992 --> 09:21.594
Not even a stolen CD.

09:22.628 --> 09:25.197
Perfect opportunity to tell
you about my new novel.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.135
You're not gonna spook
us again, are you?

09:29.969 --> 09:31.337
Readers like to be spooked.

09:31.771 --> 09:33.606
Not me. Not tonight.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.675
Mm-mmm.

09:35.942 --> 09:37.710
All right. Tell us.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.615
It takes place...

09:43.316 --> 09:45.685
in the house by the lake.

09:46.218 --> 09:47.253
You must be kidding.

09:50.156 --> 09:52.958
It actually takes place
in this very house.

09:52.959 --> 09:54.193
It begins...

09:55.061 --> 09:56.729
with an 11-year-old girl...

09:57.730 --> 10:00.098
The age when the
boundaries between reality

10:00.099 --> 10:02.034
and the inner world
are still blurred.

10:02.802 --> 10:04.136
Somewhere in the woods...

10:04.904 --> 10:10.076
three mysterious men are
discussing their evil plan.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.046
A mere story of home invasion...

10:15.047 --> 10:18.050
mixed with
supernatural elements.

10:19.752 --> 10:21.220
I don't like this already.

10:24.890 --> 10:27.626
And yes, you're supposed
to be freaked out.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.095
That's... That's the point.

10:29.929 --> 10:33.265
You see, this time I went
for a story without a plot.

10:34.033 --> 10:35.935
We never figure out
why they're doing it

10:36.402 --> 10:38.404
and what they hope
to gain from it.

10:39.238 --> 10:40.338
Why?

10:40.339 --> 10:41.974
Cause if we know
their motives...

10:42.842 --> 10:44.676
we can always convince ourselves

10:44.677 --> 10:46.212
that it will never happen to us.

10:48.848 --> 10:50.282
I want to explore fear...

10:51.717 --> 10:53.252
and masochism.

10:54.887 --> 10:57.355
I wanna know... How does it feel

10:57.356 --> 10:59.091
to be confronted with the devil?

11:01.293 --> 11:02.862
What if you don't believe in it?

11:05.398 --> 11:07.266
The only thing you
have to believe...

11:08.067 --> 11:09.268
is that there are men...

11:10.936 --> 11:12.972
capable of horrible acts.

11:15.675 --> 11:16.976
All right. Enough.

11:17.343 --> 11:20.211
Yeah. That's enough.

11:20.212 --> 11:21.247
We'll read the book.

11:22.415 --> 11:23.415
Are you finished with it?

11:25.818 --> 11:27.253
Haven't written a page yet.

11:35.127 --> 11:37.128
Oh, I'm going jogging at dawn

11:37.129 --> 11:38.297
if anyone wants to join.

11:40.933 --> 11:42.901
Yeah. Why don't you make us
breakfast when you come back?

11:42.902 --> 11:44.035
I can do that.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.236
Yeah. You don't have to do that.

11:45.237 --> 11:46.438
Anyway, night.

11:46.439 --> 11:48.307
Goodnight. See you
in the morning.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.248
It's not funny.

12:31.183 --> 12:32.918
I know you're in there, Kay.

12:43.996 --> 12:45.197
Come out now!

13:29.975 --> 13:31.143
Oh, my God.

14:48.988 --> 14:49.988
What?

15:00.199 --> 15:01.300
Dad?

15:06.472 --> 15:08.507
I'm so sorry, Dad.

15:10.542 --> 15:11.677
I'm so sorry.

15:36.969 --> 15:38.037
Daddy!

15:41.307 --> 15:42.441
Dad!

15:59.191 --> 16:01.060
My God. Come on. Hey.

16:05.064 --> 16:06.064
Come on, baby.

16:10.336 --> 16:12.503
There you go. There you go.

16:12.504 --> 16:14.573
All right. You're good.

16:15.174 --> 16:16.207
Good girl.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.743
I got you. I got you.

16:18.177 --> 16:19.177
Oh, thank God.

16:22.181 --> 16:23.448
I thought I'd lost you.

16:23.449 --> 16:26.218
Never do that again, okay?
I promise.

16:36.061 --> 16:37.596
Dad? Dad?

16:38.397 --> 16:39.431
No! No, no, no, no!

16:40.299 --> 16:41.299
Daddy?

16:42.301 --> 16:44.769
Daddy? No! No.

16:44.770 --> 16:46.104
Dad. Dad!

16:46.105 --> 16:48.707
Mom! Mom!

16:49.274 --> 16:51.042
D-Dad!

16:51.043 --> 16:53.445
No, Dad. No. No.

17:39.158 --> 17:40.626
Were you waiting for someone?

17:46.765 --> 17:47.765
Who is it?

18:08.287 --> 18:09.555
Who is it?

18:26.805 --> 18:27.805
Do it.

18:59.171 --> 19:01.540
Was that a publicity
stunt for your book?

19:03.509 --> 19:04.676
Are you out of your mind?

19:08.180 --> 19:09.180
David?

19:13.285 --> 19:14.419
What do you want?

19:24.329 --> 19:27.533
I don't like this. Yeah.
None of us do.

19:28.867 --> 19:30.702
There's a hotel ten
miles from here.

19:31.637 --> 19:33.705
Good idea. Let's get our stuff.

19:40.712 --> 19:42.648
- Oh, my God!
- Belle! Lory!

19:43.482 --> 19:44.482
Who did this?

19:45.851 --> 19:48.286
Calm down. Just grab your stuff.

19:48.287 --> 19:49.288
We're gonna go.

20:33.398 --> 20:34.566
Sorry.

20:45.677 --> 20:47.713
Damn! I forgot the keys.

21:52.744 --> 21:53.879
I don't like this.

22:06.858 --> 22:07.926
You scared us.

22:09.494 --> 22:10.796
All four.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.501
Ah, shit.

22:17.502 --> 22:18.570
Try yours.

22:26.611 --> 22:28.413
Back inside. Now.

22:31.083 --> 22:33.084
- It's disconnected.
- Of course!

22:33.085 --> 22:35.387
We need to calm down and
figure out what to do next.

23:37.482 --> 23:39.951
We're gonna sleep together
upstairs tonight.

23:40.585 --> 23:42.105
Kids' room is the
hardest to break into.

23:42.654 --> 23:44.423
Six hours till dawn.

23:44.756 --> 23:46.924
Whoever's doing this doesn't
know who they're fighting with.

23:46.925 --> 23:48.527
Well said. We'll show them.

25:48.079 --> 25:49.359
At least we'll hear them coming.

25:50.115 --> 25:51.149
We will.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.028
They only have one way in now.

26:06.264 --> 26:07.264
Lift up.

26:17.842 --> 26:18.842
Drop it.

26:23.014 --> 26:25.750
Kay and Lory, you sleep first.

26:26.051 --> 26:27.751
I won't be able
to close my eyes.

26:27.752 --> 26:29.020
Neither will I.

26:29.187 --> 26:31.156
Just try, at least.

26:49.240 --> 26:51.400
I wonder if they get off just
knowing that we're scared.

26:53.345 --> 26:54.779
You're optimistic.

27:03.355 --> 27:04.923
Shh.

27:40.191 --> 27:41.925
What? What?

27:41.926 --> 27:42.727
- Shh! Shh!
- What happened?

27:42.727 --> 27:43.727
Shh.

27:56.875 --> 27:58.977
Angela. What?

28:03.014 --> 28:04.115
Nothing.

28:11.756 --> 28:12.756
Leave!

28:13.758 --> 28:14.758
Right now!

28:19.898 --> 28:22.100
Fuck. Fuck.

28:32.944 --> 28:35.145
I saw it! It's here!

28:35.146 --> 28:37.381
K... I saw it! The terrace!

28:37.382 --> 28:39.150
He's hiding behind
the wall outside!

29:22.794 --> 29:24.929
Good evening, ladies!

29:25.396 --> 29:26.931
How bout we drop the weapons?

29:27.832 --> 29:28.933
Lower them.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.202
You too, honey. Mm?

29:32.337 --> 29:34.139
Turn around.

29:35.874 --> 29:37.242
Put it on the ground, slowly.

29:44.115 --> 29:45.115
What do you want?

29:47.485 --> 29:48.552
Move the bed!

29:48.553 --> 29:52.257
Mr. Black is anxious to
make your acquaintance.

29:53.358 --> 29:54.491
- Let's go! Move the bed!
- Move it!

29:54.492 --> 29:55.492
Let's go!

30:03.301 --> 30:04.402
Come on.

30:07.906 --> 30:09.007
Open the door.

30:10.408 --> 30:11.408
Open it!

30:15.513 --> 30:18.516
And say hello to Mr. Black.

30:39.103 --> 30:40.305
Girls!

30:41.072 --> 30:42.173
See...

30:43.241 --> 30:44.943
I'm a little underwhelmed.

30:45.977 --> 30:47.412
And a little disappointed.

30:48.279 --> 30:51.482
I expected you to be a
little bit more polite...

30:52.851 --> 30:58.289
and obey every
single word I say.

30:58.556 --> 31:02.594
I said, "Say hello to Mr.
Black!"

31:05.129 --> 31:06.297
Hello.

31:06.631 --> 31:08.399
No. No, no, no, no, no.

31:09.100 --> 31:11.202
"Hello, Mr. Black."

31:11.903 --> 31:14.105
Hello, Mr. Black.

31:18.643 --> 31:19.644
And you?

31:21.446 --> 31:22.446
Look at him.

31:26.084 --> 31:27.418
Say it!

31:29.287 --> 31:30.421
Hello, Mr. Black.

31:32.457 --> 31:34.525
Thank you. It wasn't
so hard, was it?

31:36.561 --> 31:37.641
Now, I think we could do...

31:38.963 --> 31:40.131
a little bit better.

31:41.165 --> 31:42.967
Don't you, huh? Look at him.

31:44.068 --> 31:45.136
What do you have to say?

31:46.671 --> 31:47.906
Hello, Mr. Black.

31:51.142 --> 31:52.243
And you? Hmm?

31:54.412 --> 31:55.545
Huh?

31:55.546 --> 31:56.614
Hello, Mr. Black.

31:58.149 --> 31:59.417
Say it louder, please.

32:01.619 --> 32:03.021
Hello, Mr. Black.

32:07.091 --> 32:08.359
Hello, girls.

32:11.329 --> 32:13.364
Thank you for inviting
us to your party.

32:22.507 --> 32:23.942
Shall we start...

32:25.143 --> 32:27.478
with... the fun?

32:29.113 --> 32:30.448
Please.

32:33.318 --> 32:34.318
"Please," what?

32:35.653 --> 32:38.289
Shh. It's okay. It's okay.
Please, don't kill us.

32:39.958 --> 32:40.958
Kill you?

32:42.427 --> 32:44.262
Why would I want to kill you?

32:45.296 --> 32:46.296
Blue?

32:47.465 --> 32:48.985
Do you want to kill
these young ladies?

32:51.369 --> 32:52.437
Blue!

32:53.604 --> 32:54.738
Of course not. Of course not.

32:54.739 --> 32:55.739
Red!

32:57.108 --> 32:58.576
All we want to do
is join the party.

33:04.449 --> 33:05.449
You see?

33:07.085 --> 33:09.220
Hmm? Okay.

33:10.355 --> 33:11.556
Okay.

33:13.458 --> 33:16.561
Really?

33:23.701 --> 33:24.701
Very well then.

33:29.407 --> 33:30.441
Let's begin.

33:32.577 --> 33:33.577
Take off your clothes.

33:37.248 --> 33:38.449
Hey! Girls!

33:39.050 --> 33:40.518
Don't make me repeat myself.

33:41.386 --> 33:43.054
You're gonna regret this.

33:45.323 --> 33:46.691
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure.

33:47.358 --> 33:48.359
Meanwhile...

33:49.360 --> 33:50.527
Take it off.

33:50.528 --> 33:53.364
- I politely ask.
- No!

33:56.234 --> 33:57.402
Okay.

33:59.237 --> 34:00.405
Come here.

34:07.178 --> 34:08.178
Stop!

34:11.049 --> 34:12.049
Stop.

34:16.454 --> 34:19.222
That wasn't much fun, was it?

34:19.223 --> 34:23.194
No. It actually wasn't.
Not at all.

34:37.308 --> 34:38.309
Do you have music?

34:39.476 --> 34:40.678
- Downstairs.
- Aw, yeah.

34:41.746 --> 34:43.214
Music. A little tunes.

34:44.549 --> 34:45.629
So what are we waiting for?

34:55.726 --> 34:58.396
No! No! No! No! No!

35:00.865 --> 35:02.500
Stop! No!

35:09.507 --> 35:10.641
No! No! No! No!

35:18.683 --> 35:20.218
Hey! Hey! Quit it! No!

35:22.453 --> 35:25.289
Don't you move! Don't
move a muscle!

35:32.463 --> 35:33.564
Stop!

35:37.168 --> 35:39.470
Stop. Stop.

35:39.670 --> 35:41.639
That will be a lesson
to all of you.

35:43.674 --> 35:44.709
I don't want to kill you.

35:48.646 --> 35:49.814
But I won't hesitate.

35:51.649 --> 35:52.783
Do you believe me?

35:53.284 --> 35:54.284
Yes. Huh?

35:55.286 --> 35:56.487
I can't hear you!

35:56.654 --> 35:57.755
Yes!

36:00.658 --> 36:01.893
Okay. Okay.

36:08.432 --> 36:09.367
Downstairs.

36:09.368 --> 36:11.601
Let's go! Let's go!

36:11.602 --> 36:15.405
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

36:15.406 --> 36:16.406
Come on!

36:18.609 --> 36:19.644
Take off your shoes.

36:20.511 --> 36:21.511
No.

36:21.812 --> 36:22.847
Take them off!

36:23.714 --> 36:24.715
Let's go!

36:34.425 --> 36:35.660
You first.

36:36.928 --> 36:37.929
Please.

36:39.363 --> 36:40.598
I would love to please you.

36:41.299 --> 36:42.567
I'll probably do it, too.

36:47.471 --> 36:48.706
Downstairs.

36:51.709 --> 36:52.944
Give me the chairs. Come on!

36:54.312 --> 36:55.312
Come on!

36:57.381 --> 36:58.381
Faster!

36:59.550 --> 37:00.550
Go.

37:04.855 --> 37:06.357
Go.

37:07.692 --> 37:08.692
Continue.

37:13.664 --> 37:15.233
Don't even think about it.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.335
I will kill her.

37:20.638 --> 37:21.706
Don't do it.

37:22.807 --> 37:24.274
Come on! Move!

37:24.275 --> 37:25.409
Come on! Move!

37:26.644 --> 37:27.678
Come on!

37:48.499 --> 37:49.500
Belle.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.271
There's nothing you could
have done to save me.

37:55.306 --> 37:56.707
You died for me.

37:58.943 --> 37:59.943
No.

38:00.878 --> 38:02.780
I died because I
had a weak heart.

38:07.451 --> 38:08.986
What is this?

38:11.522 --> 38:12.857
Don't let the
darkness get to you.

38:14.425 --> 38:17.728
It will harden your soul
and erode your emotions.

38:40.885 --> 38:41.885
You're next.

38:45.056 --> 38:46.424
Your turn.

38:46.624 --> 38:47.624
For what?

38:49.927 --> 38:50.995
Take off your clothes.

38:52.863 --> 38:53.863
Slowly.

38:55.099 --> 38:56.099
Sensually.

38:58.102 --> 38:59.570
Like a stripper?

39:02.340 --> 39:03.407
That would be nice.

39:05.343 --> 39:06.344
Uh...

39:13.684 --> 39:14.684
Start.

39:17.988 --> 39:19.357
Now! Okay!

39:30.868 --> 39:31.868
That's right.

39:47.518 --> 39:48.753
There we go.

41:35.092 --> 41:36.793
Okay! Sorry!

41:36.794 --> 41:38.261
Sorry! I... I'm sorry!

41:38.262 --> 41:39.697
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

41:40.664 --> 41:41.664
Stop!

41:43.767 --> 41:44.834
I won't...

41:44.835 --> 41:47.003
Stop! Stop! No!

41:47.004 --> 41:48.839
Let her go!

41:51.642 --> 41:52.710
And you're next.

41:54.912 --> 41:56.072
You want me to dance for you?

42:02.720 --> 42:05.256
You're going to be doing it for her.
Stop! Stop!

42:05.956 --> 42:06.824
Stop! You're gonna...

42:06.824 --> 42:07.824
Please!

42:33.584 --> 42:34.818
Stop.

42:35.819 --> 42:36.954
Watch.

42:39.957 --> 42:41.025
Stop!

42:41.825 --> 42:42.860
Stop!

42:50.167 --> 42:51.869
Kiss her.

42:57.675 --> 42:58.809
Give another kiss.

43:05.215 --> 43:08.018
Mmm. Yes. She likes that.

43:12.923 --> 43:14.058
Enjoy.

43:18.662 --> 43:20.196
Stop. Stop.

43:20.197 --> 43:21.599
You're still helping
your friend.

43:23.167 --> 43:24.801
Still helping her.

43:24.802 --> 43:26.904
Go on. She likes it.

43:27.771 --> 43:29.073
You want to make her happy.

43:30.674 --> 43:32.376
Stop. Stop. Stop.

43:57.234 --> 43:58.234
Jim?

44:01.672 --> 44:02.773
Jim!

44:04.708 --> 44:06.176
Oh, Jim!

44:12.750 --> 44:13.851
Jim.

44:14.885 --> 44:15.886
Jim.

44:16.253 --> 44:18.255
No, Jim.

44:18.822 --> 44:20.991
No, Jim.

44:22.092 --> 44:23.427
No.

45:23.153 --> 45:24.955
Oh, yeah.

45:26.256 --> 45:27.391
Oh, yeah.

45:28.292 --> 45:30.461
No! No! No!

45:31.428 --> 45:32.763
Now you're going down.

45:36.500 --> 45:38.000
Where are you going? Huh?

45:38.001 --> 45:41.738
Huh? Where are you going? Huh?

45:41.739 --> 45:42.873
Where are you going? Huh?

45:43.841 --> 45:44.841
No!

45:45.275 --> 45:47.144
No! No!

45:47.978 --> 45:49.846
Huh? Where you going?

45:49.847 --> 45:51.315
Come here! Come here! No!

45:52.182 --> 45:53.216
Let's get comfortable, huh?

45:53.217 --> 45:54.851
No! Get 'em off!

45:54.852 --> 45:55.852
Please!

45:57.087 --> 45:58.288
Shh. No, please!

46:01.291 --> 46:02.493
Where you going? Huh?

46:03.127 --> 46:05.195
Come here. We got a
runner, don't we?

46:12.035 --> 46:14.104
No! No! Stop!

46:14.304 --> 46:16.874
Stop!

46:19.543 --> 46:21.310
Take your shirt off! Let's go!
Come on! Someone help me!

46:21.311 --> 46:22.945
Let's see what you got, huh?

46:22.946 --> 46:24.414
No! No!

46:26.950 --> 46:29.419
No! Please! Take these off her.
Can't leave these on.

48:18.295 --> 48:19.429
Shh.

48:20.130 --> 48:21.231
It's okay.

48:28.405 --> 48:30.273
It's okay. Look at me. No.

48:30.274 --> 48:31.274
Look at me. No.

48:31.909 --> 48:32.976
Look at me.

48:34.111 --> 48:35.479
Look at me!

48:38.348 --> 48:40.384
I love you.

48:43.086 --> 48:44.086
Come here.

48:44.388 --> 48:45.923
Stand. Come here.

48:51.061 --> 48:52.529
Upsy-daisy.

48:53.697 --> 48:55.132
There we go. Come here.

49:03.206 --> 49:04.274
Shh.

49:11.348 --> 49:12.349
Look at me.

49:14.051 --> 49:15.986
Look at me. Look at me.

49:16.586 --> 49:17.587
Huh? See, it's not bad.

49:21.992 --> 49:23.359
No. Wanna dance?

49:23.360 --> 49:26.163
No. No. "Yes. Yes. Yes."

49:28.131 --> 49:30.466
Well, okay then. Let's dance.

49:30.467 --> 49:32.269
No.

51:28.452 --> 51:29.785
- Come on, baby!
- Whoo!

51:29.786 --> 51:32.522
There we go! Yeah! Whoo!

51:40.130 --> 51:41.698
Fight for that air, baby!

51:42.532 --> 51:44.334
Fly for Mr. Red!

51:45.535 --> 51:47.236
Yeah, huh?

51:47.237 --> 51:48.270
Hang, baby, hang! There you go!
There you go!

51:48.271 --> 51:49.405
You look pretty.

51:49.406 --> 51:52.375
Come on. Hang 'em up!
Hang 'em up!

51:59.249 --> 52:00.249
No!

52:05.722 --> 52:07.490
Whoo! Woo-hoo!

52:07.491 --> 52:09.159
Baby! Whoo!

52:20.203 --> 52:21.504
Whoo! Yeah!

52:21.505 --> 52:22.838
No!

52:22.839 --> 52:24.740
There you go. How's
it feel, huh?

52:24.741 --> 52:26.409
Just wanna join the
party, baby, huh?

53:55.999 --> 53:56.999
Shh.

54:46.483 --> 54:47.517
No!

55:09.572 --> 55:10.774
Huh? Come on!

55:12.509 --> 55:13.509
Hey, yo, Red?

55:24.688 --> 55:25.922
Hey, you see him?

55:26.790 --> 55:27.791
No. I don't see him.

55:30.393 --> 55:31.393
Hey, yo, Red?

55:35.098 --> 55:36.098
The fuck?

55:40.470 --> 55:41.838
Fuck.

56:11.401 --> 56:12.481
Drop your gun on the floor.

56:17.640 --> 56:19.042
I will kill her.

56:19.709 --> 56:20.844
Then I'll kill you.

56:26.850 --> 56:27.850
Open your eyes.

56:34.157 --> 56:35.158
All right.

56:35.625 --> 56:36.705
Say goodbye to your friend.

56:41.898 --> 56:42.898
Don't.

56:43.733 --> 56:44.800
Don't do it.

56:44.801 --> 56:45.835
Too fast.

56:46.903 --> 56:47.971
Not enough pain.

56:55.011 --> 56:58.448
Listen to what she says.

57:00.683 --> 57:01.684
It's not worth it.

57:11.995 --> 57:13.096
Thank you.

57:18.635 --> 57:19.702
Soon enough...

57:20.770 --> 57:22.138
you'll wish you were dead.

57:36.085 --> 57:37.085
Kay.

57:37.554 --> 57:39.022
Kay.

57:39.155 --> 57:40.489
Kay. No.

57:40.490 --> 57:41.757
No! Kay.

57:41.758 --> 57:43.992
Kay, it's me. It's me. It's me.
No! No! Get off!

57:43.993 --> 57:45.160
It's me. It's me. It's me.
It's me. No!

57:45.161 --> 57:47.497
No! Ow! Ow.

57:49.599 --> 57:51.000
They're not gonna
hurt us anymore.

58:11.054 --> 58:12.655
We're not alone, you know.

58:14.224 --> 58:15.692
You will regret this.

58:17.060 --> 58:18.380
The other two are
in the basement.

58:33.977 --> 58:35.044
They're out there...

58:36.012 --> 58:37.012
watching.

58:38.982 --> 58:39.982
See this?

58:41.784 --> 58:43.052
This is live feed.

58:44.554 --> 58:47.222
They're coming any moment now.

58:47.223 --> 58:49.224
And all of... Shh.

58:49.225 --> 58:51.895
Shh.

59:13.249 --> 59:14.249
What the fuck?

59:24.894 --> 59:25.894
What is your real name?

59:28.932 --> 59:29.966
Fuck you.

59:31.901 --> 59:33.002
Excellent.

59:33.136 --> 59:35.271
Mr. Fuck You, welcome
to the party.

59:42.211 --> 59:44.913
Maybe, just maybe,

59:44.914 --> 59:47.183
I'll spare your life if you
tell me your real name.

59:48.585 --> 59:49.752
Don't say shit.

59:55.058 --> 59:56.259
What about you?

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:02.298
Three real men.

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:04.968
Courageous, strong, defiant.

01:00:07.203 --> 01:00:08.605
I like that.

01:00:09.172 --> 01:00:11.341
They're coming.

01:00:17.313 --> 01:00:19.015
Oh, God!

01:00:20.917 --> 01:00:23.319
You're going to die slowly.

01:00:24.387 --> 01:00:25.989
That is what you deserve.

01:00:26.222 --> 01:00:28.958
No one is coming to avenge you.

01:00:29.993 --> 01:00:31.327
That really just sounded good.

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:47.210
Who is watching us? I don't...
I don't know.

01:00:47.744 --> 01:00:49.211
I don't know. It wasn't
part of the deal.

01:00:49.212 --> 01:00:50.680
Oh, God!

01:00:51.714 --> 01:00:52.749
I don't believe you.

01:00:57.186 --> 01:00:58.855
What difference does it make?

01:00:59.889 --> 01:01:01.991
None... to me.

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:09.065
What are you doing?

01:01:12.301 --> 01:01:14.102
My God! Come on!

01:01:14.103 --> 01:01:16.171
Yeah! Fucking bitch!
You fucking bitch!

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:17.273
Fuck. Fuck.

01:01:17.707 --> 01:01:19.441
Yeah! Die!

01:01:19.442 --> 01:01:23.079
Come on! Fucking bitch! Fuck.

01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:26.081
Fuck! I just killed you.

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:38.427
Belle.

01:01:42.432 --> 01:01:43.832
What?

01:01:43.833 --> 01:01:45.034
Are we supposed to be nice?

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:47.369
We should call the police.

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:51.406
No phone. The nearest
house is too far. What...

01:01:51.407 --> 01:01:52.775
What do you suggest?

01:01:53.009 --> 01:01:54.744
We shouldn't do what
they did to us.

01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:56.079
We're not.

01:01:56.279 --> 01:01:57.479
We didn't provoke the events.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.082
We're just reacting to them.

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:01.984
We shouldn't be...

01:02:02.218 --> 01:02:03.386
Angela, shut up.

01:02:04.821 --> 01:02:05.821
It's not right.

01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:10.326
They just raped you!

01:02:11.828 --> 01:02:12.828
I got...

01:02:16.099 --> 01:02:17.200
For what?

01:02:22.171 --> 01:02:24.006
For what?

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.041
Fuck! I'm sorry.

01:02:26.042 --> 01:02:27.976
So you can make your
own snuff movie?

01:02:27.977 --> 01:02:29.878
No. No. No. No. No.
No. I'm sorry.

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:30.813
Do it. Please.

01:02:30.814 --> 01:02:32.280
No. No.

01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:36.352
Please. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:38.353
Do it. I'm sorry. Please.

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:40.455
Please, please, please. Don't do it.
Don't do it. Don't do it.

01:02:40.456 --> 01:02:42.324
No! No! No! Please! Please!

01:02:42.325 --> 01:02:43.959
I'm sorry. Don't do it. Do it!

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:46.128
Please. Please. Please. Please.

01:02:46.129 --> 01:02:47.529
Fuck! Don't do it.

01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:49.898
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:02:49.899 --> 01:02:51.934
I'm so fucking...
Please! Please!

01:02:53.503 --> 01:02:56.271
What? "I'm sorry," and
all is forgotten?

01:02:56.272 --> 01:02:57.406
I can't believe it.

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.809
Nothing is forgotten!

01:03:00.143 --> 01:03:01.344
Stop! He's dying!

01:03:02.545 --> 01:03:04.046
Look, I'll tell you
everything I know.

01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:06.249
Okay? Which isn't much.

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:08.518
I'll take not much.

01:03:15.525 --> 01:03:16.525
My name is...

01:03:18.327 --> 01:03:19.362
Paul Collins.

01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:21.531
Okay? I don't know theirs!

01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:26.803
Look, we met for the first
time this afternoon.

01:03:28.004 --> 01:03:29.238
It was all preplanned.

01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:32.208
And... And he's right.

01:03:32.508 --> 01:03:35.278
The paint, the GoPro,
it was in a mailbox.

01:03:36.345 --> 01:03:38.880
And then you killed old Jim?

01:03:38.881 --> 01:03:40.115
No! No, we didn't!

01:03:40.116 --> 01:03:41.951
We weren't even supposed
to shoot at you!

01:03:43.853 --> 01:03:46.022
Look, all we had to
do was scare you...

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:49.391
play with you as
much as we wanted,

01:03:49.392 --> 01:03:50.927
and leave you here...

01:03:52.395 --> 01:03:53.395
drugged.

01:03:54.063 --> 01:03:55.164
Drugged?

01:03:56.999 --> 01:03:58.000
Yeah.

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:00.837
Look in my pocket.

01:04:11.414 --> 01:04:12.548
See? You gotta believe me.

01:04:18.187 --> 01:04:19.222
I do.

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:21.523
I do.

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:24.059
You do?

01:04:27.129 --> 01:04:28.689
Okay, so, what are you
gonna do with us?

01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:41.309
Eye for an eye. No. No. No.

01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:43.980
Fuck, no! Please! Fuck.

01:04:45.114 --> 01:04:46.382
Please.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.989
Come on. Faster!

01:04:54.957 --> 01:04:55.925
Come on. Move!

01:04:55.925 --> 01:04:56.925
Go!

01:04:58.027 --> 01:04:59.027
Move!

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:01.230
I like the way you're thinking.

01:05:03.432 --> 01:05:04.432
Get in.

01:05:04.433 --> 01:05:06.502
Come on. Shh.

01:05:09.972 --> 01:05:10.972
Come here.

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:13.109
There you go.

01:05:22.618 --> 01:05:24.353
It's been a good
companion of mine.

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:28.024
Too bad I'll have to
trash it after this.

01:05:29.158 --> 01:05:31.026
On the bed. Get on the bed!
No! No!

01:05:31.027 --> 01:05:32.027
Come on! On the bed!

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.335
For you. No! No!

01:05:40.336 --> 01:05:41.437
Here! Come here!

01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:48.444
So, Mr. Red.

01:05:49.345 --> 01:05:50.413
Wanna do us the honors?

01:05:55.217 --> 01:05:56.418
This has to stop!

01:05:56.419 --> 01:05:57.720
No, you gotta stop.

01:06:00.656 --> 01:06:01.656
Belle.

01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:04.293
Belle. Belle.

01:06:05.594 --> 01:06:06.594
It's me.

01:06:07.697 --> 01:06:08.998
Please.

01:06:09.432 --> 01:06:10.433
It's Ange.

01:06:12.601 --> 01:06:14.003
Are you really gonna kill me?

01:06:20.476 --> 01:06:21.577
Wait.

01:06:25.548 --> 01:06:27.615
Wait! Wait! No, don't
open the door!

01:06:27.616 --> 01:06:29.484
- David!
- There's no David!

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:31.619
- What if?
- You're all going crazy!

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:32.687
No, no. Please, no.

01:06:32.688 --> 01:06:34.222
Wait. No!

01:06:34.223 --> 01:06:36.192
Talk to me. No! No,
no, no, no, please!

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:49.171
What the fuck?

01:06:52.475 --> 01:06:54.410
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

01:07:30.079 --> 01:07:31.714
Hey, come on.

01:07:32.481 --> 01:07:33.481
Okay.

01:07:36.485 --> 01:07:38.487
Almost there. Come on.

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:40.556
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

01:07:51.834 --> 01:07:53.714
You didn't wanna kill us.
Is that what you said?

01:08:06.816 --> 01:08:08.384
I hope you're
enjoying this show.

01:08:15.391 --> 01:08:16.457
Come on!

01:08:16.459 --> 01:08:18.227
- Move it!
- Stop! Please!

01:08:21.197 --> 01:08:22.098
Please! Okay!

01:08:22.099 --> 01:08:23.165
Okay!

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:26.401
So?

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.537
No. No! No!

01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:32.508
Do it.

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:34.609
No more, please. Start!

01:08:36.345 --> 01:08:38.481
I'm sorry!

01:08:39.548 --> 01:08:42.318
Oh, no!

01:08:43.152 --> 01:08:44.220
Oh, no!

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.259
I'm sorry!

01:08:54.796 --> 01:08:57.666
Say "Hi" to Mr. David.

01:08:59.801 --> 01:09:01.437
- "Hi."
- Hi!

01:09:01.871 --> 01:09:02.904
"Mister."

01:09:02.904 --> 01:09:04.573
"David"! David!

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:06.741
Hi, Mr. David.

01:09:06.742 --> 01:09:08.144
Pathetic.

01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:14.849
- Oh, God!
- Shut up!

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:16.818
Please. Please. Please.

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:18.220
Shut up!

01:09:18.487 --> 01:09:19.854
You gotta stop. This...

01:09:19.854 --> 01:09:21.389
You gotta stop! Is for Angela!

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:22.390
No!

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:27.162
No! No!

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:30.198
Fuck! Stop!

01:09:30.198 --> 01:09:32.635
No! No, please! This is for...

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:57.526
Listen to me carefully.

01:09:59.795 --> 01:10:01.197
Whoever is out there...

01:10:02.731 --> 01:10:04.233
doesn't care about any of us.

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:05.968
Including you.

01:10:08.337 --> 01:10:09.977
He would already have
saved you if he did.

01:10:12.808 --> 01:10:13.876
You have no choice.

01:10:23.919 --> 01:10:24.919
Let's get out of here.

01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:35.330
Here's the plan.

01:10:37.433 --> 01:10:39.802
Lory, you sneak out from the
window in the basement.

01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:42.571
Try to get help any way you can.

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:47.610
Red, Kay, and I will try
to create a diversion.

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:49.745
Red, I'm gonna trust
you with a gun.

01:10:51.847 --> 01:10:53.816
Remember, we're not the enemy.

01:10:56.418 --> 01:10:58.338
Whatever is the amount of
money they promised you,

01:10:58.654 --> 01:11:00.623
they never intended to pay it.

01:11:15.871 --> 01:11:17.973
Don't you dare touch me!
Stand back!

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:12.494
What?

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:16.765
He cut Lory's head off.

01:12:18.734 --> 01:12:19.734
No!

01:12:19.735 --> 01:12:21.570
No, no, no.

01:12:22.037 --> 01:12:24.540
No, it's impossible.
No, it's impossible.

01:12:25.607 --> 01:12:26.775
No.

01:12:27.776 --> 01:12:29.011
No.

01:12:45.594 --> 01:12:46.895
We're gonna make it.

01:12:47.596 --> 01:12:48.731
I promise.

01:12:50.766 --> 01:12:51.900
He's not gonna get us.

01:12:58.574 --> 01:12:59.574
How?

01:13:14.923 --> 01:13:15.923
Perfect.

01:13:22.598 --> 01:13:23.598
Okay.

01:14:08.944 --> 01:14:11.513
There must be a reason for
whoever's doing this.

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:14.550
Anyone in college we hurt?

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:19.754
Anyone who wants to buy
this house for cheap.

01:14:19.755 --> 01:14:20.955
I don't know. Kay.

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:22.191
I know, I know, I know.

01:14:23.058 --> 01:14:24.059
That was stupid.

01:14:28.597 --> 01:14:30.799
Have you ever
witnessed pure evil?

01:14:35.170 --> 01:14:36.872
I wanted to write about it...

01:14:40.242 --> 01:14:41.710
but I didn't even
know what it meant.

01:14:45.013 --> 01:14:46.248
Not until tonight.

01:14:49.051 --> 01:14:50.052
I did.

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:57.226
Don't let the
darkness get to you.

01:14:58.694 --> 01:15:01.964
It will harden your soul
and erode your emotions.

01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:11.172
Belle?

01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:19.580
Belle!

01:15:21.884 --> 01:15:23.118
You got me worried.

01:15:24.853 --> 01:15:26.088
You were far away.

01:15:29.124 --> 01:15:31.026
I was just thinking
of my father.

01:16:03.959 --> 01:16:05.227
I was thinking...

01:16:06.061 --> 01:16:08.062
These old basements,
they usually have, like,

01:16:08.063 --> 01:16:10.032
a crawlspace under the house.

01:16:14.036 --> 01:16:15.137
I don't know.

01:16:27.783 --> 01:16:29.317
No! No! No! No! Wait.
Wait. Wait.

01:16:29.318 --> 01:16:31.219
No. We have to find another way.

01:16:45.801 --> 01:16:47.302
Holy shit. Okay, go.

01:17:10.192 --> 01:17:11.226
There's something there.

01:17:29.077 --> 01:17:30.078
Oh, my God.

01:17:30.879 --> 01:17:31.879
We gotta go.

01:17:41.156 --> 01:17:42.516
You were supposed
to just have fun.

01:17:44.292 --> 01:17:46.094
It didn't work out that way.

01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:49.130
No, it didn't.

01:17:50.766 --> 01:17:52.267
Who the fuck are you?

01:17:56.038 --> 01:17:58.973
You would have killed us any...
anyway.

01:17:58.974 --> 01:17:59.975
Maybe.

01:18:00.308 --> 01:18:03.744
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

01:18:03.745 --> 01:18:05.213
How does it feel, huh?

01:19:10.445 --> 01:19:11.445
Oh, my God.

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.349
Go! I'm trying!

01:19:17.385 --> 01:19:19.820
I'm trying. I'm trying. Oh, God.

01:19:19.821 --> 01:19:21.490
Oh, he's coming! Please!

01:19:31.933 --> 01:19:32.933
Oh, shit.

01:19:33.869 --> 01:19:35.370
Okay, almost there. Hold on.

01:19:46.481 --> 01:19:47.481
Hold on.

01:19:50.986 --> 01:19:52.053
I hear him!

01:19:54.322 --> 01:19:56.290
Okay, grab my hand!
Grab my hand!

01:19:56.291 --> 01:19:59.827
Get off of me! Go! Go! Go!

01:19:59.828 --> 01:20:01.062
Grab my hand. Come on.

01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:02.931
Grab my hand.

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:07.369
Come on. Come on.

01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:30.992
Let's stay here.

01:20:46.107 --> 01:20:47.108
Now.

01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:00.155
Belle. Belle!

01:21:00.956 --> 01:21:01.956
Wait!

01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:04.925
Belle!

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:07.195
Shit.

01:21:14.069 --> 01:21:15.549
How long should we
play this game, huh?

01:21:16.504 --> 01:21:17.504
You're trapped.

01:21:21.009 --> 01:21:23.545
How about I spare the life of
the first one to come out?

01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:29.017
Gonna get you either way!

01:21:37.359 --> 01:21:38.393
Now!

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:40.161
Now!

01:22:49.698 --> 01:22:51.700
I think... I think we're okay.

01:23:11.619 --> 01:23:12.619
What?

01:23:17.192 --> 01:23:18.493
We made it.

01:23:20.028 --> 01:23:21.062
We did.

01:23:25.266 --> 01:23:26.468
We made it.

01:23:30.238 --> 01:23:31.339
We're not far away.

01:23:53.128 --> 01:23:54.661
"And that night,

01:23:54.662 --> 01:23:59.234
I realized that there was no such thing
as a boundary between good or evil,

01:23:59.567 --> 01:24:02.137
black and white, right or wrong.

01:24:03.071 --> 01:24:05.407
All I learned is that this world

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:09.477
is divided by the executed
and executioners."

01:24:11.079 --> 01:24:12.079
Hm.

01:24:18.253 --> 01:24:19.354
So?

01:24:21.056 --> 01:24:22.056
What do you think?

01:24:23.792 --> 01:24:25.093
Well, it's not Shakespeare...

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:26.561
or Styron.

01:24:28.063 --> 01:24:30.665
It's certainly not Cormac
McCarthy or J.K. Rowling.

01:24:34.135 --> 01:24:35.203
You know...

01:24:37.405 --> 01:24:38.685
your proofreader did a good job.

01:24:40.642 --> 01:24:42.310
I was right about
your first book.

01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:44.479
It was a piece of crap,
and it sold nil.

01:24:47.715 --> 01:24:49.195
I really thought your
career was over.

01:24:50.118 --> 01:24:51.151
Okay.

01:24:51.152 --> 01:24:53.321
And what do you think
about this one?

01:24:54.255 --> 01:24:55.723
Not great either.

01:24:58.293 --> 01:24:59.293
But...

01:25:01.162 --> 01:25:02.464
It's gonna make a lot of money.

01:25:03.331 --> 01:25:04.199
And as you well know...

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:07.702
wealth gives you the ability
to fully experience life.

01:25:10.105 --> 01:25:11.673
That's Henry David Thoreau.
Sure.

01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:14.542
So... you like it?

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:17.145
Not a bit. But I'd be
crazy not to publish it.

01:25:17.345 --> 01:25:19.714
Yeah. You would say the
same thing about the Bible.

01:25:20.215 --> 01:25:21.216
Probably.

01:25:22.484 --> 01:25:23.484
Is this all true?

01:25:23.885 --> 01:25:24.885
Yes.

01:25:26.421 --> 01:25:27.555
It was in the newspapers.

01:25:29.357 --> 01:25:30.658
How... How do you feel?

01:25:33.228 --> 01:25:34.228
Better.

01:25:37.398 --> 01:25:38.600
Writing was cathartic.

01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:45.840
That's why I wrote "A true
story," not "Based on."

01:25:46.608 --> 01:25:48.910
Yeah, no, I, uh...
I got the nuance.

01:25:49.677 --> 01:25:52.180
So did they ever
prove Belle did it?

01:25:55.316 --> 01:25:57.152
She has never been the same

01:25:57.552 --> 01:25:59.287
since her father died.

01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:05.493
Well, I'll give you this: You got an
amazing gift for capturing details.

01:26:06.895 --> 01:26:08.530
I will never forget
a second of it.

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:12.167
It's all recorded...

01:26:13.868 --> 01:26:14.868
in here.

01:26:54.375 --> 01:26:55.410
Do you have it?

01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:01.215
It's all there.

01:27:01.416 --> 01:27:02.449
Not so fast.

01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:05.653
Everything that happened last
night is recorded in here.

01:27:19.667 --> 01:27:21.635
I trust the second half of
the payment will be there.

01:27:21.636 --> 01:27:22.970
Trust me.

01:27:22.971 --> 01:27:24.472
You'll be very satisfied.

01:27:30.278 --> 01:27:31.579
Can I ask you why you did it?

01:27:41.322 --> 01:27:43.391
I'll have to kill
you if I tell you.

01:27:50.798 --> 01:27:52.433
Now that I think about it...

01:27:54.769 --> 01:27:56.404
I have to kill you anyway.
