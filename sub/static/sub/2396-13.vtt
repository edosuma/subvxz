WEBVTT

00:01.560 --> 00:03.562
PREVIOUSLY
ON "VERONICA MARS"...

00:03.570 --> 00:06.562
CYRUS...
WE NEED TO TALK.

00:06.570 --> 00:08.765
I'VE BEEN VERY GENEROUS
OVER THE YEARS.

00:11.470 --> 00:13.370
I DIDN'T KILL CYRUS,
KEITH.

00:13.380 --> 00:14.802
Keith:
I'VE GOT A LI'I'I'LE CONUNDRUM.

00:14.810 --> 00:16.698
NISH SAYS SHE EGGED
THE DEAN'S VOLVO ON CAMPUS

00:16.710 --> 00:18.302
THE NIGHT HE WAS MURDERED.

00:18.310 --> 00:20.346
MINDY SAYS
SHE HAD THE VOLVO PARKED

00:20.350 --> 00:22.215
AT THE NEPTUNE GRAND
ALL NIGHT.

00:22.220 --> 00:23.847
ANY GUESS
AS TO WHO'S LYING?

00:23.850 --> 00:26.887
DID YOU AND MADISON HAVE SEX
OVER WINTER BREAK?

00:26.890 --> 00:28.209
WE WERE BROKEN UP
AT THE TIME.

00:28.220 --> 00:30.620
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT HER.

00:30.630 --> 00:33.929
FENNEL,
YOU RUN FIRST TEAM TODAY.

00:33.930 --> 00:35.227
WAIT, COACH --

00:35.230 --> 00:37.266
YOU WANT TO KEEP
YOUR STARTING JOB, MASON,

00:37.270 --> 00:38.965
START SHOWING ME SOMETHING.

00:38.970 --> 00:41.632
LET'S GO!

00:43.710 --> 00:46.702
CAN SOMEONE TELL ME JUST WHAT
THE HELL WE'RE DOING OUT THERE?

00:46.710 --> 00:50.578
I MEAN, WE'RE ON A BASKETBALL
COURT IN BASKETBALL UNIFORMS,

00:50.580 --> 00:53.515
BUT WHAT WE'RE PLAYING --
IT'S NOT BASKETBALL.

00:53.520 --> 00:56.284
WHERE'S THE PASSING?
WHERE'S THE TEAMWORK?

00:56.290 --> 00:58.383
WHERE'S YOUR HEADS?!

00:58.390 --> 01:00.119
AND WHERE ARE YOU, JOSH?

01:00.120 --> 01:02.725
YOU GONNA PULL YOUR
HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS
AND START PLAYING BALL?

01:02.730 --> 01:04.550
YOU'RE GETTING BACK-SCREENED
EVERY TRIP DOWN.

01:04.560 --> 01:06.198
I'M TRYING, DAD.
THEY JUST --

01:06.200 --> 01:08.794
I DON'T WANT EXCUSES, JOSH.
I WANT YOU TO GROW UP.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.358
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GOT TO DO,

01:10.370 --> 01:12.691
SO HOW ABOUT INSTEAD OF WHINING
ABOUT HOW YOU CAN'T DO IT,

01:12.700 --> 01:13.962
YOU JUST MAN UP AND DO IT?

01:13.970 --> 01:16.530
DOES THAT SOUND LIKE SOMETHING
MAYBE YOU CAN MANAGE?

01:16.540 --> 01:18.030
YOU KNOW WHAT, DAD?
NOT REALLY.

01:18.040 --> 01:20.008
SO, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
LAY OFF ME?

01:20.010 --> 01:20.999
JOSH, DAMN IT. DON'T.

01:21.010 --> 01:22.409
DON'T WHAT? QUIT?

01:31.420 --> 01:33.479
COME ON.
EVERYBODY IN HERE.

01:33.490 --> 01:36.288
SO, THEY'RE KILLING US INSIDE.

01:37.290 --> 01:40.521
FENNEL, LOOK ALIVE.

01:40.530 --> 01:43.328
WELL,
LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE.

01:43.330 --> 01:44.763
OF A 20-POINT LOSS?

01:44.770 --> 01:47.568
AND THE SMALL FORWARD
QUIT THE TEAM.

01:47.570 --> 01:49.663
WELL, YOU DID PLAY
A LOT OF MINUTES

01:49.670 --> 01:52.571
FOR A GUY WHO HAD TO QUIT
THE TEAM FIRST SEMESTER.

01:52.580 --> 01:55.435
THAT'S A SIDE,
AND IT'S SOMEWHAT BRIGHT.

01:55.440 --> 01:57.340
ME STARTING
MEANS MASON ISN'T.

01:57.350 --> 01:58.578
AND THAT'S BEEN AWKWARD.

01:58.580 --> 02:01.048
WHY? IF YOU'RE
THE BETTER PLAYER...

02:01.050 --> 02:03.382
THAT'S THE THING.

02:03.390 --> 02:04.880
I'M NOT SURE I AM.

02:04.890 --> 02:07.256
IT'S JUST THAT MASON'S ALWAYS
IN THE COACH'S DOGHOUSE,

02:07.260 --> 02:09.057
AND I'M --
YOU'RE YOU.

02:09.060 --> 02:10.687
SO, HE HASN'T BEEN SPEAKING
TO ME.

02:10.690 --> 02:13.750
BRIGHT-SIDE-WISE,
IT'S BREAK-EVEN AT BEST.

02:13.760 --> 02:15.398
YOU GET ONE MORE TRY.

02:16.930 --> 02:19.091
WELL...

02:19.100 --> 02:20.692
I GOT NOTHING.

02:21.700 --> 02:24.100
WALK IT OFF, FENNEL.

02:24.110 --> 02:25.338
YOU DOING OKAY?

02:25.340 --> 02:26.932
WITH THE LOGAN SITUATION,
I MEAN?

02:26.940 --> 02:30.376
I'VE BEEN TRYING REALLY HARD
NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT,

02:30.380 --> 02:33.178
SO THANKS
FOR BRINGING IT UP.

02:47.200 --> 02:50.465
Keith: "IF YOU'VE EATEN ANY OF
THIS BREAKFAST, YOU NOW OWE ME.

02:50.470 --> 02:54.895
INVOICES HAVE TO GO OUT TODAY.
SEE YOU AT THE OFFICE."

02:56.510 --> 02:59.673
AND I ALWAYS FALL FOR IT.

03:07.120 --> 03:10.749
MR. CASABLANCAS, I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOUR BUDDY LOGAN ECHOLLS

03:10.750 --> 03:12.718
IS GRACING US
WITH HIS PRESENCE TODAY.

03:12.720 --> 03:13.948
DOUBTFUL.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.757
WHEN THEY REMOVE
A GRAPEFRUIT-SIZED TUMOR,

03:15.760 --> 03:17.489
THEY REALLY RECOMMEND
BED REST.

03:17.490 --> 03:19.651
YOU MIGHT LET HIM KNOW THAT
IF HE MISSES ANOTHER CLASS,

03:19.660 --> 03:21.389
HE SHOULDN'T BOTHER
SHOWING UP AGAIN.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.027
HE'LL FAIL
AUTOMATICALLY.

03:23.030 --> 03:25.521
I'LL LET HIM KNOW
YOUR PRAYERS ARE WITH HIM.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.761
MR. ECHOLLS, I'M MORE THAN HAPPY
TO GIVE YOU YOUR HAMBURGER.

03:29.770 --> 03:32.409
WE'D JUST LIKE TO TAKE
SOME OF OUR TRAYS.

03:32.410 --> 03:34.628
Logan:
LEAVE THE FOOD AND GO.

03:34.640 --> 03:37.677
WE'RE OUT
OF SALT AND PEPPER SHAKERS.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.773
I'M AFRAID
I CAN'T DO THAT, SIR.

03:39.780 --> 03:44.285
WE'RE RUNNING OUT
OF SALT AND PEPPER SHAKERS.

03:44.290 --> 03:45.848
THIS NEEDS TO STOP.

03:45.850 --> 03:48.410
WHY DON'T YOU
LET ME HANDLE THIS?

03:48.420 --> 03:49.751
YO, LOGAN. IT'S ME.

03:49.760 --> 03:52.695
I'M COMING IN.
I'M BRINGING THE FOOD.

04:06.240 --> 04:09.107
DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE FIRE
IN VERONICA'S NEIGHBORHOOD?

04:09.110 --> 04:11.578
SOMEBODY'S METH LAB BLEW UP
OR SOMETHING.

04:11.580 --> 04:14.708
BET YOU CAN SEE IT
FROM THE BALCONY.

04:33.100 --> 04:38.003
I'M GONNA TAKE A SHOWER.
YOU GUYS GO TO TOWN.

04:50.750 --> 04:53.617
YOU'RE NOT STILL LOOKING
FOR THE FIRE, RIGHT?

04:53.620 --> 04:55.053
SO, I GOT A MESSAGE FOR YOU

04:55.060 --> 04:57.927
FROM THE GUY
WHO TEACHES OUR ECONOMICS CLASS.

04:57.930 --> 05:00.228
YOU GOT TO SHOW UP,
OR HE'S GONNA FAIL YOU.

05:00.230 --> 05:03.927
SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS WHEN
I'M THE ACADEMIC ON THE BALCONY.

05:03.930 --> 05:06.023
SO, IN OTHER NEWS,

05:06.030 --> 05:08.965
I MET THIS GIRL
A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AT A PARTY --

05:08.970 --> 05:10.631
* HOT! *

05:10.640 --> 05:12.130
LIKE, VOLCANIC HOT.

05:12.140 --> 05:15.974
LIKE, I MIGHT HAVE TO USE
AN OVEN MITI' TO FEEL HER UP.

05:15.980 --> 05:18.107
BLINK IF YOU UNDERSTAND.

05:18.110 --> 05:22.149
SHE'S COMING HERE TONIGHT,
AND SHE'S BRINGING HER SISTER,

05:22.150 --> 05:25.608
WHO, I MIGHT ADD, SHE DESCRIBED
AS PRACTICALLY HER TWIN.

05:25.620 --> 05:27.656
BY THE WAY,
I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH

05:27.660 --> 05:29.082
ON PATHETIC SAD SACKERY,

05:29.090 --> 05:32.150
AND "HOT SISTER'l IS
THE RECOMMENDED TREATMENT.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.229
NO, THAN KS.

05:33.230 --> 05:34.197
YOU SURE?

05:34.200 --> 05:35.519
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT GOING

05:35.530 --> 05:37.498
TO THE SWIM TEAM'S
BEACH BLANKET BLOWOUT.

05:37.500 --> 05:38.797
YOU CAN WEAR YOUR T-SHIRT

05:38.800 --> 05:42.031
THAT SAYS,
"I'D RATHER BE HOME CRYING."

05:45.670 --> 05:48.798
SO, PER MY UNDERSTANDING
OF CONTRACT LAW,

05:48.810 --> 05:53.076
MY EATING THE BREAKFAST IN NO
WAY OBLIGATES ME TO PERFORM --

05:53.080 --> 05:55.844
MY DAUGHTER, VERONICA.
SHE WORKS FOR ME.

05:55.850 --> 05:58.387
VERONICA, THIS IS
COACH BARRY'S WIFE AND SON.

05:58.390 --> 06:00.085
CLIFF BROUGHT THEM IN.

06:00.090 --> 06:02.752
COACH BARRY WAS FOUND MURDERED
LAST NIGHT BESIDE THE P.C.H.

06:02.760 --> 06:04.318
SHERIFF SUSPECTS JOSH,

06:04.330 --> 06:07.527
AND WE'VE BEEN ASKED
TO HELP FIND THE REAL KILLER.

06:08.960 --> 06:12.839
* A LONG TIME AGO,
WE USED TO BE FRIENDS *

06:12.840 --> 06:18.506
* BUT I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF YOU
LATELY AT ALL *

06:19.440 --> 06:21.078
* COME ON, NOW, SUGAR *

06:21.080 --> 06:23.605
* BRING IT ON, BRING IT ON,
YEAH *

06:23.610 --> 06:27.114
* JUST REMEMBER ME WHEN *

06:27.120 --> 06:32.148
* WE USED TO BE FRIENDS
A LONG TIME AGO *

06:32.150 --> 06:34.209
* WE USED TO BE FRIENDS *

06:34.220 --> 06:37.951

06:39.090 --> 06:41.991
SO, WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.763
I TOLD THE SHERIFF
ALREADY.

06:43.770 --> 06:46.091
WE HAD THIS FIGHT AT HALFI'IME,
ME AND MY DAD.

06:46.100 --> 06:48.330
AND I SAID I QUIT,
AND HE GOT ALL MAD.

06:48.340 --> 06:49.864
YOU KNOW,
IT WAS LIKE THAT.

06:49.870 --> 06:52.031
THERE'S A SPOT
OUT ON THE P.C.H.,

06:52.040 --> 06:54.201
THIS LI'ITLE TURNOUT
OVERLOOKING THE OCEAN.

06:54.210 --> 06:57.407
MY DAD GOES THERE AFTER LOSSES
JUST TO SIT AND MELLOW OUT,

06:57.410 --> 06:59.640
SO I WENT OUT TO TRY
AND TALK WITH HIM.

06:59.650 --> 07:00.639
WHAT DID YOU FIGHT ABOUT?

07:00.650 --> 07:02.208
DUMB BASKETBALL STU FF.

07:02.220 --> 07:06.179
"BUCK UP," "BE A MAN,"
ALL THOSE FAMOUS SPORTS CLICHS.

07:06.190 --> 07:08.613
WHEN I GOT THERE,
I THOUGHT HE ALREADY LEFT

07:08.620 --> 07:10.326
'CAUSE HIS CAR
WASN'T THERE.

07:10.330 --> 07:11.979
THEN I SAW --

07:11.990 --> 07:16.495
I SAW THIS BODY ON THE GROUND,
AND I SAW BLOOD.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.968
SO, I RAN OVER, AND...

07:18.970 --> 07:21.837
IT WAS DAD.
HE WAS DEAD -- SHOT.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.967
YOU CALL THE SHERIFF THEN?
NO, I COULDN'T.

07:23.970 --> 07:26.734
I MEAN, I TRIED, BUT YOU CAN'T
GET A SIGNAL THERE,

07:26.740 --> 07:28.605
SO -- I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

07:28.610 --> 07:30.669
ALL I COULD THINK OF WAS MOM
AND BOBBY.

07:30.680 --> 07:32.238
BOBBY IS
HIS LITTLE BROTHER.

07:32.250 --> 07:33.740
I JUST DROVE HOME

07:33.750 --> 07:35.274
SO THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO HEAR IT
FROM THE SHERIFF.

07:35.280 --> 07:38.488
WHEN HE CAME IN,
HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS IN SHOCK.

07:38.490 --> 07:40.412
HE HAD BLOOD
ALL OVER HIS SHIRT.

07:40.420 --> 07:41.819
I TOLD HIM TO TAKE A SHOWER

07:41.820 --> 07:44.584
'CAUSE I DIDN'T WANT BOBBY
TO SEE HIM LIKE THAT.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.922
WHAT LED THEM
TO SUSPECT JOSH?

07:46.930 --> 07:49.194
SOMEONE MUST HAVE FOUND
TOM'S BODY AND CALLED IN,

07:49.200 --> 07:52.692
BECAUSE AFTER JOSH SHOWERED,
THE SHERIFF ARRIVED.

07:52.700 --> 07:56.033
HE FOUND THE BLOODY CLOTHES,
THEN HE FOUND THE RING --

07:56.040 --> 07:58.201
TOM'S N.I.T.
CHAMPIONSHIP RING.

07:58.210 --> 08:00.804
YOU TOOK THE N.I.T. RING
OFF YOUR DAD'S FINGER?

08:00.810 --> 08:02.175
NO, HE LEFT IT FOR ME.

08:02.180 --> 08:03.670
AFTER I QUIT,

08:03.680 --> 08:06.342
I TOOK A SHOWER,
AND WHEN I WENT TO MY LOCKER,

08:06.350 --> 08:08.045
IT WAS JUST IN THERE.

08:08.050 --> 08:11.816
I FIGURED IT WAS SOME KIND OF
PEACE OFFERING OR SOMETHING.

08:11.820 --> 08:13.959
THAT'S WHY I WENT OUT
TO FIND HIM.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.827
P.C.H.ers HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE
FOR CARJACKINGS OUT THERE.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.697
I DON'T KNOW WHY THE SHERIFF
IS SO FOCUSED ON JOSH.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.850
THOSE GANG KIDS KILLED TOM.
THEY STOLE HIS CAR.

08:21.860 --> 08:24.294
IT'S OBVIOUS,
AND HE SHOULD BE AFTER THEM.

08:24.970 --> 08:29.464
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO MIGHT
HAVE HAD A GRUDGE WITH YOUR DAD?

08:29.470 --> 08:30.630
MEL STOLTZ.
JOSH.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.107
HE HATED DAD.

08:32.110 --> 08:34.032
HE TOLD ANYONE WHO LISTENED
HE WANTED HIM GONE.

08:34.040 --> 08:35.701
MEL STOLTZ --
STOLTZ INDUSTRIES?

08:35.710 --> 08:37.143
IT'S HEARST'S
PRIMARY BENEFACT OR.

08:37.150 --> 08:40.642
HE WANTED YOUR FATHER
FIRED, NOT DEAD.

08:40.650 --> 08:41.947
WE'LL LOOK INTO IT.

08:41.950 --> 08:43.486
AND DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE SHERIFF.

08:43.490 --> 08:46.186
HE HAS A LONG AND PROUD HISTORY
OF BEING WRONG.

08:46.190 --> 08:50.559
I'M VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS,
MRS. BARRY.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.949
WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN.

08:58.200 --> 09:02.967
IT'S AS BAD AS SHE SAYS?
LAMB'S GOING AFTER THE KID?

09:02.970 --> 09:05.461
WELL, HE WAS THINKING
VERY HARD ABOUT IT,

09:05.470 --> 09:06.732
OR HE REALLY HAD TO PEE.

09:06.740 --> 09:08.571
IT'S HARD TO TELL
WITH THAT MAN.

09:08.580 --> 09:09.979
AND YOU BELIEVE THE WIFE?

09:09.980 --> 09:12.005
SHE COULD BE LYING
TO COVER FOR HER SON.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.911
THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE.
I MEAN, I BELIEVE HER.

09:14.920 --> 09:18.048
I'VE BELIEVED MANY THINGS
THAT TURNED OUT TO BE LIES,

09:18.050 --> 09:20.951
BUT, WELL, YOU KNOW,
WHY EVEN ASK ME?

09:20.960 --> 09:23.019
HOW ABOUT THE LITTLE
BROTHER, BOBBY?

09:23.030 --> 09:24.782
HE CAN BACK UP
THEIR STORY.

09:24.790 --> 09:26.599
BOBBY IS SEVERELY
AUTISTIC.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.955
HE WON'T BE TESTIFYING
FOR ANYONE.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.730
DUDE, YOU'RE NOT HELPING.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.298
I'M AWARE OF THAT.

09:34.300 --> 09:36.165
I LIVE HERE, TOO, YOU KNOW.
THIS IS MY HOME.

09:36.170 --> 09:37.808
PEOPLE WALK IN,
THEY DON'T THINK,

09:37.810 --> 09:39.232
"THIS LITTLE CLEAN AREA
IS DICK'S,

09:39.240 --> 09:41.299
AND THE HIDDEN BOTTLES OF URINE
ARE LOGAN'S."

09:41.310 --> 09:43.904
THEY THINK "'SILENCE
OF THE LAMBS' BASEMENT,"

09:43.910 --> 09:47.744
AND THEIR DESIRE TO GET NAKED
NEAR ME TAKES A NOSE DIVE.

09:47.750 --> 09:49.012
YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'RE RICH.

09:49.020 --> 09:50.715
THIS WOULD BE
COMPLETELY DISGUSTING.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.818
HELLO, GORGEOUS!

10:00.260 --> 10:02.194
HE DOESN'T NORMALLY
LOOK LIKE THIS.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.919
SOME CHICK RIPPED OUT HIS HEART
AND STOMPED ON IT.

LOGAN ECHOLLS,
MELINDA AND HEATHER BUTTON.

10:22.180 --> 10:24.410

ABLE TO HOOK ME UP.

MY PAROLE OFFICER
