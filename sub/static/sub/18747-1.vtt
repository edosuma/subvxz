02:59.137 --> 03:02.249
You are my special angel

03:02.349 --> 03:05.085
- Special angel
- Special angel

03:05.185 --> 03:07.045
Sent from up above...

03:07.145 --> 03:09.715
- Above
- Above

03:49.146 --> 03:51.114
Mom, Dad, I'm home.

05:52.894 --> 05:56.405
- How you doing?
- Fine. Hi, how are you?

06:01.194 --> 06:03.322
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

06:05.615 --> 06:09.961
Now, I know many of you are not
that interested in Entomology 23-A.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.797
Neither was I when I first started.

06:13.957 --> 06:17.360
You're probably taking it because
it happens to meet the science requirement

06:17.460 --> 06:19.963
of this great liberal arts university

06:21.131 --> 06:23.634
or because it meets at
a convenient time of the day.

06:25.969 --> 06:28.330
Why they call it 23-A beats me.

06:28.430 --> 06:32.174
I've suggested "Introduction to bugs..."

06:32.976 --> 06:35.003
"Meeting the little creatures..."

06:35.103 --> 06:37.606
Anything but Entomology 23-A.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.383
But one thing is sure.

06:40.483 --> 06:41.718
By the time you finish this course,

06:41.818 --> 06:44.992
you will know that man
is just one species in this world...

06:45.572 --> 06:46.824
In the universe...

06:47.657 --> 06:49.059
And we're going to meet
some of the others.

06:49.159 --> 06:52.145
Some of them are
quite spectacular in their abilities,

06:52.245 --> 06:54.964
appearance, talents, and longevity.

06:56.249 --> 07:00.706
We're going to meet some creatures who do
things you've never dreamed possible.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.347
Really.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.056
Well, we have to start somewhere,
so, lights...

07:09.095 --> 07:10.312
Camera.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.518
I offer you the ephemeroptera.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.427
Hello?

07:24.527 --> 07:25.679
Who is this?

07:25.779 --> 07:26.847
Elizabeth.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.266
Is your mother in? May I speak with her?

07:29.366 --> 07:30.709
She's out right now.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.207
Okay, thank you. I'll call back.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.200
Hi, Louis.

08:05.151 --> 08:06.528
You hungry?

08:09.322 --> 08:10.665
All right.

08:13.451 --> 08:14.703
Come on.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.742
Charlie, you left the door
unlocked again.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.076
Very dangerous.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.849
I know it. I know it.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.936
He drinks beer with his dinner now.

08:36.890 --> 08:38.251
We going to the movies?

08:38.351 --> 08:39.602
Yeah, we could.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.275
Will you get it?

08:46.359 --> 08:47.576
Thanks.

08:50.613 --> 08:51.932
May I ask who's calling?

08:52.032 --> 08:54.142
His ex-wife and his daughter.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.494
Please come in.

08:57.454 --> 08:58.772
Daddy! Daddy!

08:58.872 --> 09:00.357
Hi, Elizabeth. How's my little girl?

09:00.457 --> 09:02.943
- Fine.
- That's great.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.277
What happened?

09:04.377 --> 09:06.446
I have to go to Centerville
for a few days.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.782
I have to leave Elizabeth with you.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.134
Sure. It's all right.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.039
What happened?

09:16.139 --> 09:17.561
My mother died.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.063
I've got to go back.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.322
Up! Up!

09:32.238 --> 09:33.932
Up! Up!

09:34.032 --> 09:35.892
Sorry about your mother.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.962
I know I never met her, but I'm sorry.

09:40.789 --> 09:41.961
You look real good.

09:42.707 --> 09:45.711
I was in the islands for two weeks.
The Bahamas.

09:49.380 --> 09:51.366
Goodbye, Charles.

09:51.466 --> 09:53.076
Take good care of Elizabeth.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.302
Sure.

10:12.362 --> 10:14.389
Phalangida opilione.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.036
Daddy-longlegs.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.188
Tropisternus lateralis.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.040
That's a dry beetle.

10:25.416 --> 10:26.484
Water beetle.

10:26.584 --> 10:27.801
Oh, oh.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.714
Oops.

10:31.548 --> 10:32.532
Close.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.724
Yeah.

10:35.802 --> 10:40.749
I can't understand why we haven't been
able to reach mother for the last four days.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.897
I keep thinking
we're gonna hear from her.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.481
What do you want for dessert?

10:48.398 --> 10:49.741
Ice cream.

10:56.865 --> 10:59.243
Maybe she's not coming back.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.563
Sure she is, honey.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.210
She'll be back.

11:11.629 --> 11:14.532
Operator, are you sure
there's no way to get through?

11:14.632 --> 11:17.243
I'm sorry, sir. All the lines
for Centerville are down.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.640
You'll have to try later.

11:27.478 --> 11:30.173
But I've been trying
this number for days now.

11:30.273 --> 11:32.967
The West Side has been off like
this for two weeks.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.345
If you'd like to try back later...

11:35.445 --> 11:36.446
Thanks.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.021
Hi, Morgan.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.189
Hello, Elizabeth.

11:46.289 --> 11:47.941
- Hi, Morgan.
- Hello, sir.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.009
Just make sure
she gets to school on time.

11:50.460 --> 11:51.486
Certainly, sir.

11:51.586 --> 11:53.363
And tell my mother
I'll call her in a couple of days.

11:53.463 --> 11:54.405
Of course, sir.

11:54.505 --> 11:55.631
Bye, honey.

11:56.674 --> 11:57.891
Don't worry.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.013
Bye, Daddy.

13:22.793 --> 13:24.671
Be quiet.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.068
Take it easy.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.694
Sit. Stay.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.021
Howdy. You want a room?

13:50.121 --> 13:51.272
Yes.

13:51.372 --> 13:53.149
That will be 7 bucks a night.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.192
7 bucks?

13:54.292 --> 13:55.509
Mmm-hmm.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.635
Oh, please, cash only.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.267
Out of 10.

14:04.135 --> 14:06.037
I'm here looking for the Newmans.

14:06.137 --> 14:07.538
Newman? My name's Newman.

14:07.638 --> 14:08.748
Arthur Newman.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.852
Oh, maybe you know my wife Margaret.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.671
Your wife?

14:14.771 --> 14:15.922
Margaret Newman?

14:16.022 --> 14:17.006
Yeah.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.174
I'm afraid not.

14:18.274 --> 14:21.511
I'll need your name and address, Mr...

14:21.611 --> 14:22.553
Bigelow.

14:22.653 --> 14:23.779
Bigelow.

14:24.906 --> 14:28.351
Well, maybe she left
before you got here.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.520
No, I've lived here all my life.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.772
Maybe you've got the wrong town.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.294
I don't think that's possible.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.193
Now, her mother just passed away...

14:37.293 --> 14:38.670
Alma Newman.

14:39.462 --> 14:44.367
No, I've... I know
all the Newmans in Centerville.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.369
I've never heard of her.

14:46.469 --> 14:50.623
Uh, how long are you planning
on staying, Mr. Bigelow?

14:50.723 --> 14:52.125
I'm just gonna look around.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.168
I presume you don't mind.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.045
Oh, no. No.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.113
Is that dog staying, too?

15:00.316 --> 15:04.787
Yes, well, uh, maybe you'd better
take the room out back.

15:07.323 --> 15:08.683
Here you go.

15:08.783 --> 15:13.334
And, Mr. Bigelow,
please keep that dog locked up.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.744
Oh, come on.

15:27.844 --> 15:30.238
What's the matter with you?

15:31.764 --> 15:33.107
Are you all right?

15:34.475 --> 15:36.377
Listen, I got to go look around.

15:36.477 --> 15:37.854
You stay here for awhile.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.593
No.

15:43.693 --> 15:44.785
Stay.

16:31.782 --> 16:35.019
Uh, let me ask you, do you know
if Alma Newman lives around here?

16:35.119 --> 16:36.104
No, sir.

16:36.204 --> 16:38.423
Any of you guys ever hear
of the Newmans?

16:38.915 --> 16:42.192
Well, I hear Paul Newman
might be dropping by sometime.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.531
That's funny. Real funny.

16:46.631 --> 16:49.158
Hey, Dad, we know our neighbors,

16:49.258 --> 16:52.853
and like we said, nobody by the name
of Alma Newman lives here.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.482
I didn't mean to break up all your fun.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.393
Louis?

19:01.307 --> 19:02.479
Louis!

19:14.570 --> 19:16.618
Shouldn't have brought the dog
in the first place.

19:23.454 --> 19:24.922
Louis! Louis!

19:32.129 --> 19:33.597
Louis! Louis!

20:07.540 --> 20:09.417
Yo. Fuel pump.

20:10.334 --> 20:11.586
Take a couple hours.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.555
Two hours?

20:17.425 --> 20:18.642
Half an hour.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.187
I'll wait over there.

20:45.703 --> 20:46.896
Just coffee.

20:46.996 --> 20:48.168
Something to eat?

20:49.498 --> 20:50.545
Coffee.

21:15.399 --> 21:16.867
My dog is gone.

21:26.327 --> 21:27.954
Anybody seen a dog around?

21:46.305 --> 21:47.557
A brown husky?

21:55.731 --> 21:57.074
I guess not.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.521
Nice car.

23:58.437 --> 23:59.859
You want to tell me what happened?

24:07.571 --> 24:10.871
Well, maybe you'll
think of something on the way.

25:06.755 --> 25:07.756
No.

25:12.970 --> 25:13.971
Use the key.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.957
Yes, could I have a B.L.T.? Room 2121.

27:24.726 --> 27:25.943
Room service.

27:30.482 --> 27:31.574
Room service.

27:32.109 --> 27:33.611
I'll just leave it on the table, sir.

28:10.606 --> 28:12.233
We've arrived in New York, sir.

28:13.567 --> 28:14.944
Did you have a nice trip?

28:16.278 --> 28:17.450
Yeah, great.

29:29.851 --> 29:31.386
Hello?

29:58.755 --> 29:59.865
Hello?

29:59.965 --> 30:01.217
Mother, it's me.

30:02.050 --> 30:03.493
Have you heard from Margaret?

30:03.593 --> 30:04.640
No.

30:05.095 --> 30:06.330
Is everything all right?

30:06.430 --> 30:07.456
Didn't you find her?

30:07.556 --> 30:08.557
No.

30:09.558 --> 30:10.810
How's Elizabeth?

30:12.811 --> 30:13.795
She's fine.

30:13.895 --> 30:15.067
She's still sleeping.

30:16.690 --> 30:17.674
It's awfully early.

30:17.774 --> 30:18.800
Yes, I know.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.072
I'm sorry.

30:20.569 --> 30:22.071
I'll see you both after class.

30:22.487 --> 30:23.579
Bye.

30:46.845 --> 30:47.829
Charles!

30:47.929 --> 30:50.102
Please, Henry, don't give me
a hard time about this.

30:51.141 --> 30:53.001
Some Southern Illinois state trooper

30:53.101 --> 30:56.421
picks me up in the middle
of the night on the highway.

30:56.521 --> 30:59.424
The car I'm in has no doors, no trunk.

30:59.524 --> 31:01.401
That's when I need imagination.

31:01.735 --> 31:05.080
You know, Charles,
I've been studying the stars

31:05.697 --> 31:07.324
for over 60 years.

31:07.741 --> 31:09.288
When I first came to Columbia,

31:10.118 --> 31:15.357
we didn't even know the existence
of some of the planets in our solar system.

31:15.457 --> 31:17.801
Now we travel to them, take snapshots.

31:18.877 --> 31:22.155
No, no, the boundaries of the universe,

31:22.255 --> 31:26.180
the laws that govern the world
have changed so much in my time.

31:30.305 --> 31:34.584
But a bug-eyed monster blowing up cars
somewhere in the Midwest?

31:34.684 --> 31:35.901
Forget it, Charlie.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.798
It seems to me, Charles,
you've got two choices.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.718
I can give you a phone number
of a woman I know.

31:42.818 --> 31:44.594
She works for the government.

31:44.694 --> 31:47.322
She listens to all these stories
for a living.

31:47.823 --> 31:48.890
Or?

31:48.990 --> 31:51.601
Or you can try and forget
the whole thing,

31:51.701 --> 31:55.581
go back to work, later go home,
clean the apartment, and see a movie.

31:58.041 --> 32:01.045
Charles, you never surprise me.

32:02.963 --> 32:04.406
Thanks, Henry.

32:04.506 --> 32:06.759
Believe me, Margaret will call.

32:25.068 --> 32:26.136
Mrs. Benjamin.

32:26.236 --> 32:28.472
Uh, this is Charles Bigelow.

32:28.572 --> 32:30.995
Dr. Hollister gave me this number.

32:32.325 --> 32:33.372
Yes?

32:35.370 --> 32:36.838
I saw something.

32:38.206 --> 32:40.004
Well, come on in.

32:40.667 --> 32:42.419
I'm on the eighth floor.

32:42.544 --> 32:43.545
Okay.

33:12.532 --> 33:14.142
Well, this is odd.

33:14.242 --> 33:19.106
According to what we have,
no one has lived in that town since 1958,

33:19.206 --> 33:21.129
when it was destroyed by a tornado.

33:22.709 --> 33:25.963
You say your ex-wife
comes from that town?

33:26.880 --> 33:27.927
Yes.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.429
How long were you married?

33:31.718 --> 33:32.935
Four years.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.765
What happened? Why did you get divorced?

33:39.559 --> 33:43.814
Uh... I don't think
that's any of your business.

33:48.068 --> 33:51.789
All right, Mr. Bigelow.
I'm going to show you some drawings.

33:53.406 --> 33:56.956
These are renderings
of the most commonly sighted aliens.

33:58.161 --> 34:00.814
I want you to look at them
and tell me if you see anything

34:00.914 --> 34:04.384
that reminds you of the creature
you saw last night on the road.

34:10.297 --> 34:11.344
No.

34:14.219 --> 34:15.266
No.

34:20.308 --> 34:22.034
No.

34:23.143 --> 34:25.172
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Bigelow.

34:25.272 --> 34:27.400
Just a little joke we have around here.

34:30.193 --> 34:31.915
Why don't you come with me?

34:33.822 --> 34:36.891
We receive reports
of all kinds of phenomena here.

34:36.992 --> 34:39.018
As a scientist,
you'll be interested to know

34:39.119 --> 34:43.043
that most of them turn out
to have very rational solutions.

34:44.916 --> 34:48.612
Just last year we had,
uh, a rash of phone calls

34:48.712 --> 34:51.511
about a 50-foot woman in Oregon.

34:52.340 --> 34:55.869
She only came out at night,
running down the highway.

34:55.969 --> 34:57.437
Running and running...

34:58.471 --> 34:59.873
We checked it out.

34:59.973 --> 35:05.104
Andrea Criban, the world's
tallest woman basketball player.

35:06.187 --> 35:07.530
She was in training.

35:08.315 --> 35:11.259
Then there was
this small town in Louisiana,

35:11.359 --> 35:13.386
where it rained on the same 10-block...

35:13.486 --> 35:16.035
Look, I didn't say
it was raining in Centerville.

35:18.825 --> 35:21.770
Mr. Bigelow,
if there was something out there,

35:21.870 --> 35:23.713
don't you think we'd know about it?

35:27.375 --> 35:29.127
I'll have the marine show you out.

35:31.838 --> 35:33.055
Thanks.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.428
Betty Walker?

36:36.528 --> 36:37.620
Yes?

36:39.531 --> 36:40.908
My name is Charles Bigelow.

36:42.158 --> 36:43.956
I'm a Professor at Columbia.

36:44.786 --> 36:46.663
Columbia? That sounds serious.

36:48.707 --> 36:51.631
You're from a Pulitzer Prize
committee, right?

36:54.045 --> 36:55.763
Well, what can I do for you?

36:56.631 --> 36:58.491
Do you have a cigarette, by any chance?

36:58.591 --> 36:59.968
Uh, I quit.

37:00.427 --> 37:01.661
What's on your mind?

37:01.761 --> 37:05.165
- Did you write this article?
- Yes, I did, if you can call it that.

37:05.265 --> 37:06.482
Well...

37:08.601 --> 37:09.944
I saw one.

37:11.563 --> 37:12.589
What?

37:12.689 --> 37:13.986
I saw one of these.

37:16.609 --> 37:18.553
Tim, could you come here
a minute, please?

37:18.653 --> 37:20.430
I'd like you to hear this.

37:20.530 --> 37:22.828
Mister, uh, Bigelow here

37:23.992 --> 37:25.685
has just seen an alien.

37:25.785 --> 37:27.312
Hi, Mr. Bigelow.

37:27.412 --> 37:29.776
Go on, Mr. Bigelow.

37:30.331 --> 37:34.052
Okay, it was in Illinois,
in Centerville.

37:34.669 --> 37:37.697
It was standing on the side of the road.

37:37.797 --> 37:39.449
I drove right past it.

37:39.549 --> 37:42.035
Uh, it looked just like this.

37:42.135 --> 37:44.287
It had these smooth, obsidian eyes.

37:44.387 --> 37:46.748
Wait a minute. Let me guess.

37:46.848 --> 37:47.916
You were hypnotized.

37:48.016 --> 37:49.751
You were taken aboard a flying saucer,

37:49.851 --> 37:53.276
where they placed you on a silver table
and examined you.

37:53.855 --> 37:58.093
You even have tiny marks
all over your body to prove it.

37:58.193 --> 38:02.073
Look, Mr. Bigelow, we don't pay
very much for alien stories anymore.

38:03.072 --> 38:04.724
Two-headed dogs...

38:04.824 --> 38:05.892
That's very big.

38:05.992 --> 38:10.338
Two-headed dogs maybe,
but aliens are... passé.

38:12.916 --> 38:14.192
Finished?

38:14.292 --> 38:15.509
Mmm-hmm.

38:16.002 --> 38:18.488
All right. It fired at me.

38:18.588 --> 38:21.888
It was like a laser beam.
It struck my car.

38:22.550 --> 38:23.802
Very powerful.

38:28.056 --> 38:29.353
Is that "laser beam"?

38:32.393 --> 38:35.237
I know it sounds ridiculous,
but it happened.

38:37.023 --> 38:39.801
All I want to know is,
where did this picture come from?

38:39.901 --> 38:42.074
It was just in the file
with some old letters.

38:43.029 --> 38:44.781
No one's supposed to believe this stuff.

38:45.657 --> 38:46.909
She made it up.

38:51.079 --> 38:52.877
Well, I won't keep you any longer.

39:12.892 --> 39:15.503
You know, if you're in a hurry,
you should have taken the stairs.

39:15.603 --> 39:17.105
It's only 18 stories.

39:18.565 --> 39:19.782
I'm sorry.

39:20.400 --> 39:23.028
You know, we don't get very many
visitors around here anymore.

39:23.611 --> 39:26.205
At least, not since the Bigfoot story.

39:28.074 --> 39:30.247
All right, I'm sorry.
Here are your glasses.

39:33.246 --> 39:34.623
I know, it wasn't that funny.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.973
Come on, loosen up.
I'm trying to be nice.

39:49.095 --> 39:51.518
Don't change
your personality just for me.

39:52.432 --> 39:53.979
Oh, that's good. I like that.

39:54.601 --> 39:57.462
Well, now that we're past
the awkward getting-to-know-you phase,

39:57.562 --> 39:58.939
let me buy you a drink.

39:59.898 --> 40:01.341
Well, come back tomorrow.

40:01.441 --> 40:03.535
Maybe we can find this photograph.

40:22.837 --> 40:24.239
Hi, Earl. How you doing?

40:24.339 --> 40:27.242
Well, not too well today.
My Aunt Mabel died.

40:27.342 --> 40:29.327
Well, you can't criticize her for that.

40:29.427 --> 40:32.580
Oh, you know, Earl, that funny-sounding
machine next to the sink

40:32.680 --> 40:34.165
that's supposed to make
my garbage disappear?

40:34.265 --> 40:35.250
Uh-huh.

40:35.350 --> 40:36.459
Well, it doesn't!

40:36.559 --> 40:38.186
Well, I guess I'll be up later.

40:39.896 --> 40:40.988
Okay, girls.

40:57.997 --> 40:59.691
Hello. Avon calling.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.359
New wave, right?

41:01.459 --> 41:02.610
Uh, pardon me?

41:02.710 --> 41:04.821
Well, the look. I mean,
you're part of a band or something?

41:04.921 --> 41:07.282
Uh, we have many fine products.

41:07.382 --> 41:09.701
Oh, come on. Don't you people
do any market research?

41:09.801 --> 41:11.895
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

41:12.887 --> 41:15.665
Well, then, let me put it this way.
I don't want any.

41:15.765 --> 41:17.667
Oh, but please, if you would...

41:17.767 --> 41:21.442
If you would just let me familiarize you
with some of our miraculous products,

41:22.563 --> 41:23.780
it could change your luck.

41:24.315 --> 41:26.818
Well... Not today.

41:43.710 --> 41:44.819
Are you okay?

41:44.919 --> 41:46.136
It's the heat.

41:46.796 --> 41:48.990
Well, can I get you something to drink?

41:49.090 --> 41:53.328
No. If I could just use
your bathroom, my dear...

41:53.428 --> 41:54.600
I guess it's okay.

42:00.143 --> 42:01.878
You have a lovely apartment.

42:01.978 --> 42:05.465
Thank you. The bathroom's over there,
just around the corner.

42:05.565 --> 42:06.612
Thank you.

42:25.543 --> 42:26.715
Hello?

42:28.671 --> 42:31.049
Hello? Are you okay?

42:32.467 --> 42:33.844
Is there anything I can do?

42:35.261 --> 42:36.979
Would you like me to call someone?

42:52.028 --> 42:53.972
Jesus, Earl, you scared me.

42:54.072 --> 42:55.665
Well, the door was open.

42:56.741 --> 42:59.060
Look, Earl, I know
this is going to sound ridiculous,

42:59.160 --> 43:01.834
but I think a strange woman's
locked herself in my bathroom.

43:02.580 --> 43:04.127
Well, Betty, how'd she get in there?

43:05.333 --> 43:07.085
Earl, I let her in.

43:08.628 --> 43:10.881
Well... I'll have a look.

43:11.380 --> 43:12.597
Thanks.

44:04.725 --> 44:07.899
Earl, you know what I was thinking?

44:09.480 --> 44:11.323
Maybe we should call the cops.

44:12.441 --> 44:13.567
Earl?

44:17.405 --> 44:18.497
Earl?

44:26.914 --> 44:30.293
Miss Walker, could you come
with me for a minute?

44:36.966 --> 44:38.868
You know, there's one thing
that bothers me.

44:38.968 --> 44:40.845
Normally, when someone's
been electrocuted...

44:43.055 --> 44:44.272
There's a body.

44:46.976 --> 44:48.273
Where's the body?

45:44.200 --> 45:45.292
Tim?

45:46.661 --> 45:47.812
What?

45:47.912 --> 45:51.399
You know, I think there was a letter
that came with this photograph.

45:51.499 --> 45:52.546
So?

45:53.709 --> 45:55.131
Well, could you find it?

45:56.462 --> 45:57.714
This filing system?

45:59.006 --> 45:59.949
Come on, Tim.

46:00.049 --> 46:01.075
All right, all right, all right.

46:01.175 --> 46:02.472
I'll see what I can do.

46:13.604 --> 46:14.947
Excuse me.

46:18.693 --> 46:19.865
Is there something wrong?

46:20.653 --> 46:22.872
No. I've just been
working here too long.

46:25.324 --> 46:26.871
What do you teach, anyway?

46:28.869 --> 46:30.246
Entomology.

46:31.497 --> 46:32.714
Insects.

46:36.585 --> 46:37.677
What do you want?

46:39.964 --> 46:42.558
Thought we should have that drink.

46:45.386 --> 46:48.981
She said she was an Avon lady,
for Christ's sakes.

46:49.390 --> 46:52.269
You know, one of those
well-scrubbed Midwestern faces...

46:52.893 --> 46:56.422
Oklahoma, where the wind
comes sweeping down the plains.

46:56.522 --> 46:58.445
Hmm, or Illinois.

46:59.108 --> 47:00.325
I know.

47:02.528 --> 47:03.700
Go on.

47:04.238 --> 47:05.932
I let her use my bathroom. That's it.

47:06.032 --> 47:07.625
That's the last I saw of her.

47:08.576 --> 47:11.876
But if I run into her again,
I'm going to be ready.

47:16.542 --> 47:17.610
You know what I think?

47:17.710 --> 47:20.696
Yeah, I know what you think, and I don't
want to hear it. It's just too creepy.

47:20.796 --> 47:21.922
Listen to me!

47:23.758 --> 47:25.326
I think they followed me.

47:25.426 --> 47:26.769
I led them right to you.

47:27.678 --> 47:29.601
Anyway, you published that photograph.

47:33.184 --> 47:34.731
I wonder what they want.

47:38.731 --> 47:43.511
You know, several times during the last
few days, I thought I was going mad.

47:43.611 --> 47:45.113
Nobody wants to hear this.

47:46.322 --> 47:47.640
But I'm a scientist.

47:47.740 --> 47:49.208
I know what I saw.

47:51.118 --> 47:53.120
I just want somebody to believe me.

47:53.621 --> 47:56.124
I believe you, Charlie, I really do.

47:56.999 --> 47:59.235
Although let's not tell anybody,
you know what I mean?

47:59.335 --> 48:00.678
Let's just forget it.

48:01.170 --> 48:03.197
I mean, I don't want to walk...
Walk around saying

48:03.297 --> 48:06.200
there was an alien in my apartment
who gobbled up my supe.

48:06.300 --> 48:07.677
It sounds ridiculous.

48:08.469 --> 48:09.537
I want to forget it.

48:09.637 --> 48:12.015
I want to go away
for a long vacation and...

48:13.474 --> 48:15.476
Oh, God, I want some dinner.

48:31.992 --> 48:35.062
All right! That's nice.

48:35.162 --> 48:37.189
Look at this!

48:37.289 --> 48:39.166
Incredible. He's great!

48:39.625 --> 48:41.569
I don't believe it.

48:41.669 --> 48:43.046
He's not even looking at it!

48:43.170 --> 48:45.093
Aw, sure.

48:45.840 --> 48:47.183
Riverside Drive, please.

48:47.967 --> 48:49.576
Hey, I'm going to play.

49:04.859 --> 49:06.093
Hmm?

49:06.193 --> 49:07.386
I don't dance.

49:07.486 --> 49:09.705
What do you mean, you don't dance?
Everybody dances.

49:11.824 --> 49:15.294
This is quaint, too.
Who's your decorator?

49:17.872 --> 49:21.192
Well, you want a beer
or some water or something?

49:21.292 --> 49:23.670
No. A nice, soft chair would be fine.

49:30.843 --> 49:32.345
My God, what was that?

49:34.513 --> 49:35.890
It's not a pet, is it?

49:37.141 --> 49:39.251
I hope it doesn't have a coy name.

49:39.351 --> 49:41.879
No, uh, it belongs
in that jar right there.

49:41.979 --> 49:44.256
I just haven't been able
to catch it yet.

49:44.356 --> 49:45.633
Please, I can't take any more.

49:45.733 --> 49:48.577
No more surprises,
nothing unexpected, please.

50:07.046 --> 50:08.298
I'll be right back.

50:13.802 --> 50:14.995
Who is it?

50:15.095 --> 50:16.768
Charles, it's Margaret. Open up.

50:18.098 --> 50:19.395
Margaret?

50:20.434 --> 50:21.651
What happened to you?

50:22.520 --> 50:23.692
I tried to find you.

50:25.356 --> 50:27.133
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

50:27.233 --> 50:29.076
Where have you been
for the last week and a half?

50:29.693 --> 50:31.115
I've got to talk to you.

50:33.322 --> 50:36.292
Uh, you'll never guess what happened.
My wife just returned.

50:37.535 --> 50:40.062
You never told me you were married.

50:40.162 --> 50:42.606
You told me other things,
but not that you were married.

50:42.706 --> 50:44.066
I'm not.

50:44.166 --> 50:47.966
Why don't you check the dictionary
under W-I-F-E?

50:48.796 --> 50:49.989
We're divorced.

50:50.089 --> 50:51.557
Uh-huh, sure.

50:52.132 --> 50:53.117
Where you going?

50:53.217 --> 50:54.309
Home.

50:58.222 --> 50:59.707
You don't understand.

50:59.807 --> 51:01.333
You're right, I don't.

51:01.433 --> 51:04.562
I'll call you tomorrow... Maybe.

51:05.938 --> 51:06.939
Fine!

51:20.160 --> 51:22.413
Charlie, where is Elizabeth?

51:22.913 --> 51:24.165
She's at my mother's.

51:33.674 --> 51:36.518
Charlie, there's something
we have to talk about.

51:44.226 --> 51:47.355
I was supposed to find out
how things work here.

51:51.025 --> 51:53.119
But instead I found a way...

51:56.572 --> 51:58.370
The way I wanted to live.

51:59.283 --> 52:01.627
And when it didn't work out
with you and me,

52:02.620 --> 52:04.372
there was still Elizabeth.

52:06.373 --> 52:10.128
Now, Charles, now,
now is the important time.

52:10.878 --> 52:13.472
Now they want Elizabeth, too.

52:14.340 --> 52:15.717
You've got to get to her.

52:16.300 --> 52:19.429
You've got to hide her
for the next couple of days,

52:20.095 --> 52:22.518
until 9:00 on Sunday night.

54:20.466 --> 54:22.076
I shot one.

54:22.176 --> 54:26.413
And it had green blood, and I think
they're on their way up here.

54:26.513 --> 54:28.207
Is there any other way out of here?

54:28.307 --> 54:29.875
Just the fire escape.

54:29.975 --> 54:31.648
Well, you hurry. I'll stop them.

54:32.352 --> 54:33.353
Go.

55:13.101 --> 55:14.169
Get in!

55:14.269 --> 55:15.691
Get in, for God's sake!

55:26.406 --> 55:28.642
Now tell me I didn't see
anybody in Centerville.

55:28.742 --> 55:30.102
- Tell me nobody's living there!
- Mr. Bigelow...

55:30.202 --> 55:31.437
Come on, tell me! Come on.

55:31.537 --> 55:33.897
Well, I can't do that.
You know I can't do that.

55:33.997 --> 55:36.024
Come on, tell me.
I wanna hear you say it!

55:36.124 --> 55:38.923
You've intruded
on a very delicate situation.

55:39.586 --> 55:40.758
Come on, Benjamin.

55:41.505 --> 55:43.615
All right, I will tell you one thing.

55:43.715 --> 55:45.492
We have an agreement with them.

55:45.592 --> 55:47.936
We've known about them for a long time.

55:48.804 --> 55:51.331
They provide us with certain advantages,

55:51.431 --> 55:53.876
and we provide them
with a place to live.

55:53.976 --> 55:55.335
But it hasn't been easy!

55:55.435 --> 55:57.463
We haven't had much choice at all.

55:57.563 --> 56:00.299
Don't give us that. They're after us!

56:00.399 --> 56:02.026
Charlie, who is this?

56:03.277 --> 56:05.780
This is the government woman
I told you about.

56:06.488 --> 56:07.765
Hello. I'm Betty Walker.

56:07.865 --> 56:09.959
I know who you are, Miss Walker.

56:11.034 --> 56:14.021
Your article has caused us
a lot of agony.

56:14.121 --> 56:17.483
You know, these people don't know
what a rag your newspaper is.

56:17.583 --> 56:19.711
They actually take it seriously!

56:20.294 --> 56:21.653
I don't know what they'll do next.

56:21.753 --> 56:22.738
Well!

56:22.838 --> 56:25.057
Driver, go to East 63rd Street.

57:43.335 --> 57:44.444
They took her.

57:44.544 --> 57:45.887
- Bigelow, wait!
- Let's go.

57:56.807 --> 57:58.059
Get 'em.

58:10.570 --> 58:13.164
Put out an A.P.B.
for the bridges and the airports.

58:13.573 --> 58:14.790
What about the trains?

58:15.450 --> 58:17.418
Nobody takes the train anymore.

58:22.332 --> 58:23.675
Gate 27...

58:24.626 --> 58:26.153
His name is Willie Collins.

58:26.253 --> 58:27.321
What?

58:27.421 --> 58:29.239
The guy who sent the photograph.

58:29.339 --> 58:30.556
Oh, oh.

58:35.303 --> 58:38.273
Look, he's in Illinois.
Let's go and see him.

58:38.932 --> 58:42.252
Charlie, listen to me.
He knows about them.

58:42.352 --> 58:45.026
This is where he is.
I'm sure he can help us.

58:46.273 --> 58:47.616
I hope you're right.

58:54.406 --> 58:57.330
Well, she said the deadline
was 9:00 p.m. Sunday.

58:57.909 --> 58:59.456
It's 11:00 now.

59:05.792 --> 59:07.886
Whatever it is, we have 34 hours.

59:22.642 --> 59:24.144
They took the train.

01:00:05.477 --> 01:00:07.354
I was on a train once.

01:00:09.147 --> 01:00:11.525
It wasn't anything like this, of course.

01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:14.199
Was that before you met Margaret?

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:16.662
Mmm-hmm.

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:21.226
Where'd you meet her, Charlie?

01:00:21.326 --> 01:00:22.873
Cape Canaveral?

01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:29.510
No. Uh, I met her in a bookstore...

01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:32.216
Scribner's Bookstore.

01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:35.240
Charlie?

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:36.283
Hmm?

01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:38.101
Can I ask you the obvious question?

01:00:38.844 --> 01:00:39.936
What?

01:00:40.512 --> 01:00:41.955
Didn't you know she was...

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:43.932
Well, a little strange?

01:00:48.353 --> 01:00:53.405
Well, she was difficult to live with,
but so am I, and, uh...

01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:59.953
She was a good mother. Is a good mother.

01:01:00.907 --> 01:01:03.877
And she doesn't have
to strike a match to light a stove.

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:11.543
Yeah, well, it was a talent
she kept to herself.

01:01:41.239 --> 01:01:43.058
This is it, Charlie.

01:01:43.158 --> 01:01:45.502
Looks like some kind of hospital.

01:01:47.495 --> 01:01:48.792
It's an asylum.

01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:53.176
Dr. Milch, Dr. Anthony Milch,
please call 261.

01:01:54.002 --> 01:01:57.222
Dr. Stayman, Dr. Wally Stayman,
please call 46.

01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:02.220
He's a permanent patient, east wing.

01:02:02.928 --> 01:02:04.671
Permanent?

01:02:09.184 --> 01:02:11.437
Willie, you have some visitors.

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:14.406
Say hello.

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:18.701
Mr. Collins, I'm Betty Walker
from The National Informer:

01:02:21.112 --> 01:02:22.705
Do you remember you wrote us a letter?

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:34.593
Thank you, Nurse.

01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:39.597
We just need to talk to you.

01:02:43.134 --> 01:02:45.933
Come to see what kind of lunatic
writes things like this, huh?

01:02:46.888 --> 01:02:48.140
Interview the madman?

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:50.813
No.

01:02:51.851 --> 01:02:53.545
I've had a lot of visitors like you
through the years.

01:02:53.645 --> 01:02:56.298
It stops being amusing after a while.
It might be better if...

01:02:56.398 --> 01:02:57.945
Look, they took my daughter.

01:03:05.657 --> 01:03:06.954
Come with me.

01:03:24.843 --> 01:03:26.311
They killed my family.

01:03:27.679 --> 01:03:28.726
Sit down, please.

01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:40.195
I was a young man then,

01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:43.070
had just set myself up in business.

01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:46.741
I had a family, just like most folks.

01:03:48.116 --> 01:03:49.413
Oh, you can smoke here.

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:53.004
We were on vacation.

01:03:54.039 --> 01:03:55.712
First one we took
since the kids were born.

01:03:57.792 --> 01:03:59.569
We drove across the country.

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:01.046
Wanted to see America.

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:03.698
Then one day, driving along,

01:04:03.798 --> 01:04:06.472
must have been in the car
since 6:00 in the morning,

01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:08.495
my wife's complaining.

01:04:08.595 --> 01:04:09.812
She wants me to stop.

01:04:10.764 --> 01:04:12.766
The kids were driving her crazy,

01:04:14.267 --> 01:04:16.315
like kids will do, making her mad.

01:04:18.897 --> 01:04:20.240
Then she sees a town.

01:04:21.941 --> 01:04:24.219
It was one of those perfect
summer nights.

01:04:24.319 --> 01:04:25.662
It was still light out.

01:04:27.781 --> 01:04:29.249
There wasn't a soul around.

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:33.377
We saw a rooming house, decided to stop.

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:38.233
I must have gone over this
a million times in my mind.

01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:39.880
Why didn't I just go to sleep?

01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:42.570
I don't know.

01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:43.967
It's probably all that driving.

01:04:46.591 --> 01:04:48.685
Anyway, I felt jittery.

01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:50.641
Went for a walk.

01:04:52.347 --> 01:04:53.599
I came to a church.

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:55.232
There was this sound,

01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:57.398
very high-pitched.

01:04:58.395 --> 01:04:59.942
It was like it was drawing me in.

01:05:01.106 --> 01:05:04.326
The sound was coming
from behind the altar.

01:05:08.613 --> 01:05:11.162
There was an open door
that led underground,

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:13.827
so I went down.

01:07:20.954 --> 01:07:22.126
Alice!

01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:26.633
Daddy!

01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:00.205
Aah!

01:08:03.663 --> 01:08:04.710
Aah!

01:08:08.668 --> 01:08:10.511
Daddy?

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:13.882
Daddy?

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:19.937
Daddy?

01:08:31.983 --> 01:08:33.200
Willie.

01:08:36.194 --> 01:08:38.555
Daddy.

01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:41.250
Willie.

01:08:46.663 --> 01:08:48.416
Daddy?

01:08:49.334 --> 01:08:50.801
I never saw them again.

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.966
I went home, tried to get some help.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.408
You can probably guess
what that was like.

01:08:57.508 --> 01:09:00.557
My friends thought
I'd become a serious crackpot.

01:09:01.386 --> 01:09:02.830
Everybody else thought
I was a mad killer

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:05.183
who'd be hanged as soon as
they could find the bodies.

01:09:05.558 --> 01:09:07.481
Then, then I went to Washington.

01:09:08.645 --> 01:09:11.944
I actually thought that they would help.

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:16.365
It was the shortest
investigation in history.

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:18.495
Then I got proof.

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:20.741
That photograph.

01:09:21.491 --> 01:09:22.617
I sent it everywhere.

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:26.962
It even took your paper 10 years
before they printed it.

01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:42.203
I guess I got somebody worried, though,
because they started following me.

01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:43.770
I'd come home at night...

01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:47.457
It felt like people
had been in the house.

01:09:47.558 --> 01:09:49.685
It was like they were playing
a game with me.

01:09:53.564 --> 01:09:54.941
That's all.

01:09:56.442 --> 01:09:57.614
I finally gave up.

01:10:00.279 --> 01:10:02.657
This is my way of saying I surrender.

01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:06.436
I'm no threat to them here.

01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:08.459
I'm no threat to anybody here.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.052
Nurse.

01:10:22.343 --> 01:10:23.640
Will you come here, please?

01:10:25.805 --> 01:10:29.652
This man has been to Centerville.
He's seen the aliens.

01:10:29.752 --> 01:10:33.838
That's right, Willie.
Visiting hours are almost over.

01:10:34.272 --> 01:10:36.652
I'm going there right now.

01:10:38.276 --> 01:10:39.594
I'll take him from here.

01:10:39.694 --> 01:10:41.867
Say goodbye to your visitors, Willie.

01:10:57.879 --> 01:10:59.176
I'll be with you.

01:11:00.298 --> 01:11:01.515
I'll be with you.

01:11:05.303 --> 01:11:06.454
I don't know what to think.

01:11:06.554 --> 01:11:09.123
A few days ago, my biggest worry
was my telephone bill.

01:11:09.223 --> 01:11:10.770
Well, don't come along with me, then.

01:11:11.434 --> 01:11:14.587
You suggesting I take a room,
set up shop in the east wing?

01:11:14.687 --> 01:11:15.755
That's a good idea.

01:11:15.855 --> 01:11:17.548
Let me explain something
to you, Charlie.

01:11:17.648 --> 01:11:20.093
You're a professor who devotes
a major portion of your day

01:11:20.193 --> 01:11:22.095
carving up bugs and flirting with coeds.

01:11:22.195 --> 01:11:25.014
I'm just a simple working girl
who's been making up stories like this

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:28.601
for The National Informer for years,
and I'd very much like to see it.

01:11:28.701 --> 01:11:30.203
Can you understand that?

01:11:31.496 --> 01:11:32.605
Look, Betty...

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:34.707
I know, I know. Forget it.

01:11:59.732 --> 01:12:01.279
You got a light, hmm?

01:12:02.235 --> 01:12:03.908
Never mind. Never mind.

01:12:05.238 --> 01:12:06.305
You're going to need some help.

01:12:06.405 --> 01:12:07.390
Oh.

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:09.242
I'm just the guy
who's gonna be able to give it to you.

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:12.503
I've been waiting for this
for a long time.

01:12:41.232 --> 01:12:42.279
Okay.

01:12:43.067 --> 01:12:44.410
There she blows.

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.963
Of all the places
they could have come to...

01:12:56.956 --> 01:12:58.708
Probably millions
of light years away, huh?

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:07.808
Oh, shit.

01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:15.166
Sorry, sir.
No one is allowed beyond this point.

01:13:15.266 --> 01:13:16.250
Why is that?

01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:17.772
There's been some trouble down the road.

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:19.900
Bigelow, is that you?

01:13:22.732 --> 01:13:24.717
Miss Walker's in there too, I presume?

01:13:24.817 --> 01:13:25.968
Hi, Mrs. Benjamin.

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:28.846
You two have been more trouble
than you will ever know.

01:13:28.946 --> 01:13:30.640
You can wait here with us for an hour.

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:32.391
Then it'll all be over.

01:13:32.491 --> 01:13:33.743
What'll all be over?

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:36.044
It's all been negotiated, Bigelow.

01:13:37.204 --> 01:13:39.774
They came here 25 years ago today,

01:13:39.874 --> 01:13:41.000
and now they're leaving.

01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:42.276
Don't move!

01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:43.673
Are you crazy?

01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:45.071
Hold your fire!

01:13:45.171 --> 01:13:47.073
Back! I'll kill her.
I'll kill her. I mean it.

01:13:47.173 --> 01:13:48.157
You can't stop them.

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:49.242
Turn around.

01:13:49.342 --> 01:13:51.410
Come on, Willie, come on. Give me that.

01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:52.807
Here, take this.

01:13:53.512 --> 01:13:54.997
Get in the car.

01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:56.165
Don't shoot!

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:57.959
Okay. Come on now.

01:13:58.059 --> 01:13:59.168
Back.

01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:00.378
Get away!

01:14:00.478 --> 01:14:01.570
Back!

01:14:17.203 --> 01:14:18.420
Hold your fire!

01:14:27.046 --> 01:14:28.093
Charlie...

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:33.807
As soon as you have the girl,
I'll be there.

01:14:38.516 --> 01:14:39.542
To tell you the truth,

01:14:39.642 --> 01:14:41.878
I really don't expect to be
seeing the two of you again.

01:14:41.978 --> 01:14:43.980
Come on, Willie. We'll see you later.

01:15:02.707 --> 01:15:03.754
Let's go.

01:15:56.177 --> 01:15:58.179
She does not belong there.

01:15:58.763 --> 01:16:01.582
Please let her stay.
She's so very happy here.

01:16:01.682 --> 01:16:03.059
It's time, Margaret.

01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:07.321
Better get her ready.

01:16:37.676 --> 01:16:39.178
Daddy! Daddy!

01:18:01.594 --> 01:18:07.291
My dear friends, we send
our greetings and congratulations.

01:18:07.391 --> 01:18:11.362
You have reached the end
of a long and arduous project.

01:18:12.938 --> 01:18:17.510
When we were ﬁrst commissioned to do
our study of this planet and its people,

01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:22.286
no one thought we would accomplish
so much in such a short period of time.

01:18:23.073 --> 01:18:27.453
When the crisis struck,
we were given a deadline, and we met it.

01:18:28.454 --> 01:18:31.816
Some of you gathered
the scientiﬁc information we require,

01:18:31.916 --> 01:18:35.637
and others studied and participated
in the social structure.

01:18:36.253 --> 01:18:38.631
This has proven of great value,

01:18:39.089 --> 01:18:41.638
although some of you
may have become too involved.

01:18:42.301 --> 01:18:45.555
But I'm happy to know
you'll all be returning with us.

01:18:46.597 --> 01:18:51.377
The information you carry with you
will help our leaders to make a ﬁnal decision

01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:54.777
as to our future
and the future of this planet.

01:18:55.856 --> 01:18:59.156
I understand that we have
an addition to our group.

01:18:59.485 --> 01:19:04.491
What an amazing and unexpected pleasure
this news was for us here.

01:19:06.075 --> 01:19:09.750
Let the little creature come forward.
Let us see.

01:19:10.621 --> 01:19:12.840
Little Elizabeth, come forward.

01:19:32.726 --> 01:19:34.023
That's right.

01:19:36.021 --> 01:19:37.089
Elizabeth! Come here!

01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:38.361
Daddy!

01:19:41.068 --> 01:19:46.498
Mr. Bigelow, your daughter
is about to travel very far away.

01:19:46.865 --> 01:19:48.583
It will be very difﬁcult for her to...

01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:07.638
Willie!

01:21:07.738 --> 01:21:08.990
Willie, hurry up!

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:10.915
Willie!

01:21:15.412 --> 01:21:16.629
Willie!

01:21:21.668 --> 01:21:24.592
No, no! Betty! Get back. Get back!

01:21:33.806 --> 01:21:35.683
Just give us the girl.
We don't want to harm you.

01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:37.397
No.

01:21:37.851 --> 01:21:40.024
I really don't think
you have much choice, ma'am.

01:21:40.813 --> 01:21:42.235
Give her to us now.

01:21:42.648 --> 01:21:44.070
The lady said no, fella.

01:21:50.656 --> 01:21:52.374
Don't you people understand English?

01:22:02.042 --> 01:22:04.511
No! No! Willie! No!

01:22:06.171 --> 01:22:07.531
Aah!

01:22:24.106 --> 01:22:26.425
Now don't you think
you'd like to give us the girl?

01:22:26.525 --> 01:22:27.509
No.

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:28.826
I'm sorry.

01:22:30.237 --> 01:22:31.784
I'm sorry, Elizabeth.

01:25:36.506 --> 01:25:38.575
It is time, Mr. Bigelow.

01:25:38.675 --> 01:25:40.552
We are going to leave.

01:25:43.722 --> 01:25:46.566
Daddy, I don't want to go!

01:25:47.392 --> 01:25:48.609
Neither do I, honey.

01:25:49.895 --> 01:25:51.863
Mommy, help us!

01:25:58.028 --> 01:26:00.281
For the love of God, Margaret,
do something!

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:06.245
Now!

01:26:11.041 --> 01:26:12.338
Now, Elizabeth!

01:26:12.668 --> 01:26:15.421
Do what Mommy told you now!

01:29:00.752 --> 01:29:03.280
Please remain calm.

01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:05.803
Everything is under control.

01:29:06.508 --> 01:29:08.510
You're out of danger now.

01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:13.915
- Betty? Betty!
- Please remain calm.

01:29:14.015 --> 01:29:16.109
There's no need to be afraid.

01:29:16.601 --> 01:29:18.069
We're here to help you.

01:29:20.355 --> 01:29:21.857
Well, save me.

01:29:28.321 --> 01:29:29.493
Ready?

01:29:33.243 --> 01:29:34.686
How'd you get up there?

01:29:34.786 --> 01:29:36.129
Don't ask.

01:29:58.143 --> 01:29:59.440
She'll be back.
