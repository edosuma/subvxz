00:01.101 --> 00:02.168
My name is Lena Grisky

00:02.202 --> 00:05.171
and I go to the best
ballet school in the world.

00:05.205 --> 00:06.372
I have a secret.

00:06.406 --> 00:08.374
I'm a time traveler from
1905

00:08.408 --> 00:11.277
and my boyfriend Henri
is doing everything he can
to get me home.

00:11.645 --> 00:14.615

Go off the beat ♪

00:14.648 --> 00:17.551

(Henri) 'I know
I sound mad but I'm not joking.
Time travel is really a thing.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.404
My dad says
you went through a portal,

01:11.437 --> 01:15.676
which means you should end up
in the exact same place,
just in a different year.

01:16.276 --> 01:22.649
I don't know what year
exactly,
but if my Dad's right, then
you're still at the Garnier.

01:23.283 --> 01:25.619
So that's good, right?'

01:33.527 --> 01:37.363
'That necklace I gave you,
that's the reason
you time traveled.

01:37.397 --> 01:42.435
It's special.
Keep it in a safe place.
Always keep it protected.

01:42.468 --> 01:45.371
There are people
who'd do anything
to get their hands on it.'

01:55.181 --> 01:59.553
'I don't want to scare you,
but this is really important.
Beware.

01:59.586 --> 02:04.357
Three guys.
Dressed in strange clothes.
These are the Time Collectors.

02:04.390 --> 02:08.361
They will know
what year you're in,
and that terrifies me.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.266
They're coming for you.'

02:49.970 --> 02:53.707
'I know it wasn't
exactly the plan,
but I promise I'll find you.'

02:54.575 --> 02:56.610
(classical music plays)

02:57.310 --> 03:00.280
(Lena gasps)
(students laugh)

03:00.614 --> 03:02.683
May I try again please?

03:03.416 --> 03:04.618
Thank you.

03:06.052 --> 03:11.357
(Henri) 'Whatever time
you're in, just do what
you always do. Dance.

03:11.391 --> 03:14.194
Dance like
your life depends on it.

03:14.895 --> 03:17.798
Blend in and stay away
from the Time Collectors.

03:18.431 --> 03:20.601
Dance like
your life depends on it.'

03:21.434 --> 03:22.836
Wow!

03:46.960 --> 03:48.294
(gasps)

03:48.995 --> 03:52.298
(threatening music)
(Gabrielle tuts)

03:52.332 --> 03:53.366
Excuse me.

03:53.399 --> 03:54.801
(Gabrielle) Elena!

03:57.971 --> 03:59.472
Can I help you, boys?

03:59.506 --> 04:00.874
Too many people here...

04:00.907 --> 04:06.412
(Franck) Don't worry,
Paris is ours.
She'll be alone soon enough.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.693
(students chattering)

04:21.027 --> 04:24.798
Hi, Thea. Social report.
You have ninety-six
more followers.

04:24.831 --> 04:26.867
(Bree) School report.
Dede and Brock broke up.

04:27.734 --> 04:31.371
Oh no, wait... That was on the
show "Emergency Beauty Queens."

04:31.404 --> 04:33.373
Nothing new at school to
report.

04:35.341 --> 04:37.277
(camera shutters clicking)

04:38.845 --> 04:40.614
Post that one.
My followers will love it.

04:42.082 --> 04:47.487
(Jeff beatboxes, then gasps)
Whoa! Dude, dude...

04:47.521 --> 04:49.956
She's totally famous
from that show Dance Off.

04:49.990 --> 04:54.360
Ho, ho ho! My friends are
gonna lose their minds, bro!

04:55.929 --> 04:57.664
Ready, ready? One, two,
three...

05:06.773 --> 05:07.641
Who is she?

05:08.008 --> 05:09.576
Excuse me?

05:09.610 --> 05:12.813
Erm... I was just
asking...

05:14.047 --> 05:19.385
Elena Grande. She's new.
And she's a problem.

05:21.454 --> 05:23.724
Bree, look away.

05:24.791 --> 05:29.029
What's up with her, anyway?
She looks like
a scared little rabbit.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.031
(girls snigger)

05:31.598 --> 05:33.399
She wrecked my Défilé.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.836
She'll pay for destroying
my moment.

05:35.869 --> 05:38.338
Totally. Like money?

05:39.439 --> 05:44.377
Bree, don't be so literal.
She'll pay because
she'll want to be us and can't.

05:44.745 --> 05:47.447
(scoffs) Yeah, that's
totally
what I meant...

05:51.184 --> 05:52.719
Hey, you.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.088
You alright?

06:01.562 --> 06:02.929
Welcome home.

06:03.196 --> 06:06.499
Did you see
those motorcars outside?

06:06.533 --> 06:09.903
Wait... home?
But I thought you said
we were going to the school.

06:09.936 --> 06:13.073
And here we are...
School, Milady.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.075
But we sleep
at the Garnier, yes?

06:15.108 --> 06:17.043
I wish.
But our room's pretty good.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.581
How is Henri ever gonna find me
if I'm not there but here?

06:20.614 --> 06:25.051
Oh! A boy! That's why
you're being so weird.

06:25.085 --> 06:29.590
You can text, e-mail, and
VideoChat this Henri guy.
It's like, no biggie.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.825
I simply must be at the
Garnier,
the Paris Ballet House.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.827
Yeah, relax,
we go there all the time.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.596
Really? Truly?

06:35.629 --> 06:38.832
What are you, a hundred?
Yes, really, truly.

06:38.865 --> 06:41.134
Now come on,
I've got your back.

06:46.172 --> 06:50.176
(phones beeping and ringing)

06:57.250 --> 07:00.921
Wow. This is the future!

07:04.224 --> 07:05.826
(phone beeps)

07:07.994 --> 07:11.632
You guys! It's the invitation
to the Blok audition.

07:11.665 --> 07:15.669
This is... huge.
You've got to dance like
you've never danced before.

07:15.702 --> 07:17.871
You. Wear blue. You. Green.

07:17.904 --> 07:21.207
Nobody wear pink,
cause that's my color. Got it?

07:22.075 --> 07:24.044
(whispers) She told me
to throw all of my blue...

07:24.077 --> 07:25.011
(whispers) Get this.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.013
What are you all
standing there for?

07:27.047 --> 07:30.717
You should be practicing,
picking out outfits.
Go. Go.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.558
It's an underground
dance crew: the Blok.

07:37.591 --> 07:40.060
Determines your social status
for the rest of the year.

07:40.093 --> 07:42.495
It's the only place where
we can dance hip-hop and stuff.

07:42.529 --> 07:43.730
Sick!

07:43.764 --> 07:46.266
The fact that you're new and
still got in? Really cool man.

07:46.299 --> 07:51.505
Well, hip-hop is my thing.
And I'm gonna wipe the floor
with your lameness.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.241
Just don't let it
get in the way
of why you're here, you know?

07:55.275 --> 07:56.276
What's that supposed to
mean?

07:56.309 --> 07:59.079
It means ballet first.

07:59.112 --> 08:04.084
And save your "thing"
for after class not during it,
if you know what I mean.

08:04.117 --> 08:07.153
Sure. Yo, check it dude.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.861
Wooh.

08:18.965 --> 08:20.133
(laughs)

08:20.734 --> 08:22.603
That's what I thought!

08:25.238 --> 08:27.908
So at 6:30,
you better be ready to roll.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.209
I shower at night.
More hot water.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.177
Oh, do you wanna
write this down?

08:31.778 --> 08:36.717
Okay, so breakfast's at seven.
Then boring school. Then lunch.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.052
Then ballet, ballet pairs,
ballet tech, then...

08:39.753 --> 08:40.554
Lena, are you listening?

08:40.587 --> 08:44.658
Hmmm. What is this?
It's delicious!

08:44.691 --> 08:47.928
Is that what you call
this miracle? Piesa.

08:47.961 --> 08:50.897
How do you not know
what pizza is?
Aren't you from Italy?

08:56.637 --> 08:58.071
Are they trousers?!

08:58.104 --> 09:01.107
Okay. What is your deal?
Like, where are you from?

09:01.141 --> 09:03.744
Cause you sound like you
just landed from another planet.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.880
And you act like you just
stepped out of a documentary
on the History Channel.

09:07.213 --> 09:10.817
I'm from a small town
in Russ... Italy.

09:10.851 --> 09:14.254
And we don't have any of
these modern day conveniences.

09:14.287 --> 09:19.192
And girls certainly
don't wear trousers.
Or eat pizza.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.962
Wow.
Are they really comfortable?

09:22.796 --> 09:25.599
Oh. Are you Amish?

09:26.867 --> 09:31.304
Oh... Okay, yeah, yeah!
I totally get you.

09:31.337 --> 09:37.878
With the clothes
and the overall panic. Right.
Okay... I can work with this.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.045
(phone beeps)

09:40.881 --> 09:44.017
OMG. This just in!
"Dance if you dare". You in?

09:44.050 --> 09:45.519
Am I in what exactly?

09:45.552 --> 09:49.122
Only the coolest gig around.
How's your street dancing?
Hip-hop? No?

09:50.891 --> 09:55.829
Oh, you didn't get
invited.
Hey, don't feel bad,
I didn't get asked last year.

09:55.862 --> 09:58.632
And I guess being Amish
you don't have a phone,

09:58.665 --> 10:02.636
so he wouldn't have
your digits anyway.
But it's okay, you're with me.

10:02.669 --> 10:06.006
I don't mean to be rude,
but what language do you speak?

10:06.039 --> 10:12.112
Funny. You're kinda weird,
but lucky for you,
weird is my jam.

10:14.380 --> 10:16.382
I'm half Brit, half
American.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.952
Dude, you're spilling it.

10:18.985 --> 10:21.655
I spend summers in London
with my dad.

10:21.688 --> 10:24.891
My mum's a diplomat,
so she travels everywhere.
They're divorced.

10:24.925 --> 10:27.961
But anyway,
let's continue with the tour!

10:32.165 --> 10:33.366
(squeals with joy)

10:40.373 --> 10:43.176
(laughs) Really, Jeff?

10:43.209 --> 10:47.013
You spend more time
in front of the mirror than
anyone else in this place.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.815
He's just showing us
around.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.018
You ready for the tour?

10:55.989 --> 11:00.694
Oh, I get it...
You've got a crush on him.
(laughs)

11:01.394 --> 11:02.963
Tour on!

11:06.266 --> 11:08.735
OK, memorize it.
Studios are over there.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.804
That one's for the girls,
that one's for the boys.

11:10.837 --> 11:16.409
And don't be late. Like, ever.
Unless you're dead.
And even then, I'd get a...

11:16.442 --> 11:18.244
(boys snigger)

11:20.881 --> 11:25.185
First time with a glass door...
Don't worry.
It happens to everyone.

11:25.886 --> 11:30.023
Sort of.
They didn't even notice.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.960
(boys burst out laughing)

11:53.346 --> 11:54.881
Is this a costume party?

11:54.915 --> 11:59.820
Hardly. You dance on the roof
to get into a secret
underground dance crew.

12:00.521 --> 12:01.955
Whose?

12:01.988 --> 12:06.993
Max. Alverez? Hello?

12:07.027 --> 12:08.228
And it's a secret.

12:08.261 --> 12:12.032
I mean, we know, but no one
can know that we know. You know?

12:12.065 --> 12:16.202
He does it every year.
It's the highest status
in the school if you make it in.

12:16.236 --> 12:19.973
You can never talk about it.
You're either in, or out.

12:20.006 --> 12:22.976
Please tell me that isn't
what you're wearing.

12:24.545 --> 12:28.048
Oh! Your stuff hasn't arrived.
I can lend you something.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.084
Oh no, that's okay.
This is my favorite dress.

12:31.117 --> 12:34.220
It's what I would wear
to a formal event.
Thank you, though.

12:34.254 --> 12:39.225
Okay. If you wanna look like
my Great Aunt Rosemary,
then go right ahead.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.326
Let's go.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.828
But it's after dark
and we don't have a chaperone.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.899
Which is anxiously cold.

12:45.932 --> 12:49.169
You mean... awesomely
cool?

12:49.202 --> 12:53.339
That is what I mean.
Shall we call the footman
to get the carriage?

12:53.373 --> 12:58.378
Okay, erm...
No footman. No carriage.

12:58.912 --> 13:04.184
(laughs nervously)
I was just trying to have
a humorous exchange. Erm...

13:05.351 --> 13:07.554
Let's... let's travel
forth.

13:07.588 --> 13:09.155
Okay.

13:14.995 --> 13:20.500
(hip-hop beat plays,
students cheer)

13:39.920 --> 13:42.022
Why does he always do
that?

13:42.055 --> 13:46.860
Tonight's like an audition.
If we get in, we won't be
total social outcasts.

13:46.893 --> 13:49.195
No offense, but you need
this.

13:49.896 --> 13:50.897
Come on.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.250
Nope.
-Wasn't asking!

14:30.036 --> 14:32.305
Come on, new girl,
show us what you got.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.981
Okay, don't panic,
but it's your turn.

14:41.014 --> 14:41.915
My turn for what?

14:41.948 --> 14:44.284
You need to win this.
Redemption is key.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.485
What is the contest?

14:45.519 --> 14:46.787
Dance. Come on.

14:46.820 --> 14:49.990
Oh no, that's okay.
I'm just going to watch,
thank you.

14:50.957 --> 14:53.660
Come on, don't be shy!

14:53.694 --> 14:55.128
Go.

14:59.199 --> 15:01.134
(distant cheering)

15:09.743 --> 15:13.914
Look at me.
You can do this. Take Thea down.
Come on. Clap her in!

15:26.527 --> 15:28.294
She's gonna need a
miracle.

15:28.328 --> 15:31.097
(Henri) Dance like
your life depends on it.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.341
Woohoo!

15:44.010 --> 15:46.547
(students) Go, go, go!

15:55.188 --> 15:57.323
Right... Keep it simple,
yeah?

16:11.638 --> 16:13.674
Oh, I'm so sorry!

16:16.409 --> 16:17.443
She's still going.

16:20.346 --> 16:22.048
(all gasp) Oooh!

16:24.417 --> 16:27.453
It's okay. I'm okay.
Keep the game going.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.422
(all cheer)

16:31.792 --> 16:34.060
I accept the contest.

16:40.466 --> 16:43.136
(Jeff) Wooh!
Thea! You're on fire, girl!

16:43.704 --> 16:46.272
(all) Thea! Thea!

16:46.306 --> 16:47.273
Nice!

16:47.307 --> 16:50.310
(Ines) Dude, seriously, stop!
That's enough!

16:52.646 --> 16:54.147
(booing)

16:59.520 --> 17:02.823
How am I doing? Am I
winning?
I think I'm winning!

17:02.856 --> 17:05.826
Winning? No, no!
You're kind of doing
the opposite of winning.

17:05.859 --> 17:08.361
Come on, you can stop now.

17:08.394 --> 17:10.597
Don't worry.
I'll teach you some stuff.

17:10.631 --> 17:12.699
Like how to navigate
the world of teenagers

17:12.733 --> 17:16.169
or maybe a few
non-Amish dance moves.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.605
That was awful.
(laughs)

17:18.639 --> 17:21.842
Seriously painful, dude.
I'm gonna have to teach you,

17:21.875 --> 17:26.279
because I can't see that again.
Like, it burned my eyes.

17:26.680 --> 17:29.249
Like, the image is burned
onto my corneas.

17:29.583 --> 17:31.852
I think I actually
might need surgery.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.153
(laughs)

17:34.120 --> 17:36.657
(all) Go, go, go!

17:39.325 --> 17:41.862
He doesn't actually
need surgery, right?
That was a joke?

17:41.895 --> 17:43.396
See? You're learning.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.739
(threatening music)

17:54.608 --> 17:56.543
Argh... She's always
surrounded by people.

17:56.577 --> 17:57.644
I can dance my way in.

17:57.678 --> 18:01.447
No Clive.
You won't dance
your way into anywhere.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.184
We need to get to her
through the boyfriend.

18:09.623 --> 18:12.192
Let's go. Something feels off.

18:39.485 --> 18:41.622
Thank you for coming
to this staff meeting.

18:44.190 --> 18:48.161
As you know, we demand
excellence in this school.

18:48.194 --> 18:50.864
And it's up to me
to uphold such excellence.

18:57.437 --> 19:02.142
Okay, so. I have decided
to cut Elena Grande.

19:10.651 --> 19:12.719
(gasps)

19:13.486 --> 19:15.689
No way!

19:16.456 --> 19:17.858
Yes!

19:18.291 --> 19:21.361
Dash? Dash? Dash!

19:21.394 --> 19:26.432
Check it out man! I got in!
Wooohoooo!

19:26.466 --> 19:27.668
And you did too!

19:27.968 --> 19:30.203
Whoa!
-No way, dude!

19:31.304 --> 19:33.473
Yes! Sick.

19:33.507 --> 19:37.711
(both cheer and laugh)

19:38.645 --> 19:40.480
(laughs)

19:40.514 --> 19:42.415
Woooh!

19:45.552 --> 19:48.288
(phones beeping, students laugh)

19:50.991 --> 19:53.293
Play it again!
(all laugh)

19:55.929 --> 19:57.764
(Ines' phone beeps)

20:35.536 --> 20:36.937
Sooo?

20:38.505 --> 20:40.574
I don't have my card yet.
-No?

20:41.074 --> 20:44.010
Nope.
-Huh. Weird.

20:45.746 --> 20:47.681
Did you check your
pockets?

20:53.053 --> 20:56.623
(squeals excitedly)
You're the best!

20:56.957 --> 20:59.926
You owned it last night.
Killer moves.

21:07.467 --> 21:10.671
(hip-hop beat plays on TV)

21:28.522 --> 21:29.890
Oh, I'm so sorry.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.359
I need to blend in.

21:34.761 --> 21:37.898
When I was little,
I could outrun any boy
in the pala... place.

21:38.464 --> 21:41.467
And everyone said
I couldn't climb trees.
But I could and I did.

21:41.935 --> 21:45.038
She's not going to beat me.
She's about to get...

21:46.740 --> 21:47.841
what's the word?

21:47.874 --> 21:49.409
Schooled?

21:49.442 --> 21:51.645
Really? That's the word?

21:51.945 --> 21:54.881
You could say beaten, or owned,
but I'd say schooled.

21:55.716 --> 21:58.484
All right, then.
I'm gonna schooled her!

21:58.519 --> 22:01.822
(laughs) Yeah! Schooled
her.

22:05.959 --> 22:06.927
I need your help.

22:08.494 --> 22:10.697
I'd like to take your
offer up
on the wardrobe.

22:13.133 --> 22:16.469
I'm gonna wear...
trousers!

22:16.503 --> 22:18.071
(both laugh)

22:18.104 --> 22:22.408
Okay.
What's mine is yours.
Tadaa!

22:22.876 --> 22:23.877
(both laugh)

22:49.435 --> 22:51.972
Impressive. Show me that
move.

22:52.005 --> 22:55.008
All in good time, my friend.
I wouldn't want you
to hurt yourself.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.077
Haha! Funny.

22:58.612 --> 23:01.782
Whoa! What is up with her?

23:04.050 --> 23:06.019
(gasps)

23:06.853 --> 23:07.854
(laughter)

23:09.089 --> 23:12.058
Alright, alright.
Let's see you
strut your stuff then.

23:13.627 --> 23:14.861
Yeah!

23:20.601 --> 23:25.506
(classical music starts)

23:25.539 --> 23:27.173
(changes to dance beat)

23:34.981 --> 23:37.183
(gasps)
Woohoo!

23:51.932 --> 23:53.967
(Jeff) Oh, yeah!

23:58.939 --> 24:01.642
Oh, she's looking at you Thea.

24:23.997 --> 24:25.799
Woohoo!

24:30.937 --> 24:32.573
Uh-huh.

24:45.686 --> 24:47.688
(cheering and clapping)

24:48.121 --> 24:49.823
Thank you.

24:54.260 --> 24:55.161
Well done!

24:55.195 --> 24:57.698
Wow. I mean...
I did not see that coming!

24:57.731 --> 25:00.767
That was unbelievably cool.
I knew you had it in you.

25:00.801 --> 25:04.037
Woooooooh, yes!

25:04.070 --> 25:07.073
But, I'm gonna have
to give you a few lessons
in the world of hip-hop.

25:07.107 --> 25:08.208
Gratis, of course.

25:08.241 --> 25:11.144
(Dash)
Really impressive, new girl.

25:13.980 --> 25:16.016
Too bad you couldn't
pull that off last night.

25:16.049 --> 25:19.986
Or yesterday
at the workshop audition.
Too little, too late, I'd say.

25:20.020 --> 25:22.989
Well, I mean... She got
one of these, didn't she?

25:27.060 --> 25:28.895
(others gasp and whisper)

25:30.797 --> 25:32.165
(whispers) She is so over.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.801
What? Tell, tell!

25:35.235 --> 25:40.006
She's out. Cut. Over.
Miss Carré told me herself.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.775
(Kennedy and Bree)
Wow.

25:41.808 --> 25:44.645
(Ines)
Where did that come from?
-(Gabrielle) Students!

25:48.782 --> 25:54.354
The dancers that will be chosen
for my workshop are as follows.

25:54.387 --> 25:57.157
Max Alverez.

25:57.190 --> 25:59.025
Dash Khan.

25:59.926 --> 26:02.128
Ines Le Breton.

26:02.162 --> 26:03.597
Jeffery Chase.

26:03.630 --> 26:04.931
Hm?

26:04.965 --> 26:08.902
Mr. Chase?
Do you not feel you belong?
Should I reconsider?

26:09.302 --> 26:14.207
No, Ma'am. I just...
There's so many good dancers.

26:14.240 --> 26:18.178
And sometimes I get...
No, Ma'am.

26:18.211 --> 26:19.179
Aaron Licht.

26:20.981 --> 26:22.983
Thea Raphael.

26:24.317 --> 26:25.719
And finally...

26:26.019 --> 26:27.153
Elena Grande.

26:27.187 --> 26:28.955
(hurried footsteps approach)

26:28.989 --> 26:33.193
I'm so sorry I'm late.
Hi everyone. I'm Elena Grande.

26:33.226 --> 26:34.728
(all gasp)

26:34.761 --> 26:38.198
(student) Whoa. Who is she then?
