01:01.293 --> 01:02.726
Look at you.

01:03.295 --> 01:06.389
- Look over here. Okay, great, great.
- All right, let's do this.

01:06.465 --> 01:08.160
Do you like my new dress?
Okay, ready?

01:08.234 --> 01:10.168
All right, say "cheese. "

01:10.236 --> 01:12.898
Oh, wait. Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:13.939 --> 01:17.500
Maybe it's just me, but can
I just say, why "cheese"?

01:17.576 --> 01:20.909
I know it's not your fault, obviously
you didn't make it up, but please,

01:20.980 --> 01:22.880
it makes us look like
pod people.

01:22.948 --> 01:24.609
How about something
more snapshot like?

01:24.683 --> 01:25.911
Au naturel.

01:32.291 --> 01:34.486
That's good.
I think we've got it, though, don't you?

01:34.560 --> 01:35.720
I'm living the dream
over here.

01:35.795 --> 01:39.356
Honey, did you see that young
man Cousin Dougy brought with him?

01:39.431 --> 01:40.989
He's been staring
at you all afternoon.

01:41.066 --> 01:43.762
Don't destroy the cake.
I used fresh tangerines.

01:43.836 --> 01:45.326
Can you taste it
in the frosting?

01:45.404 --> 01:48.771
Has he really? It's delicious.
Yeah, God, his eyes are gorgeous.

01:48.841 --> 01:51.241
They're kind.
And they're gorgeous. Go on.

01:51.310 --> 01:52.777
I'll go over.
You will?

01:52.845 --> 01:54.176
Yeah.
Okay. All right.

01:54.246 --> 01:55.543
Oh, but, honey.

01:55.614 --> 01:58.014
Just don't do that thing
you do. What thing, Mom?

01:58.083 --> 02:00.347
Oh, you know that little
thing. It's no big deal.

02:00.419 --> 02:02.649
That, you know, when you're
insecure, you're self-conscious,

02:02.721 --> 02:05.087
that little very loud,
nervous laugh?

02:05.157 --> 02:06.522
Honey, it's adorable, but...

02:06.592 --> 02:09.322
Oh, God, look, there she goes.
Oh, look.

02:09.395 --> 02:10.657
Oh, I know, we see it.

02:10.729 --> 02:12.629
She only buttons the part
she can see in the mirror.

02:12.698 --> 02:16.759
At least she shaves more than the front of
her legs now, she's got almost the whole...

02:16.836 --> 02:18.167
Hi.
Hi.

02:18.237 --> 02:20.034
Okay, it's going...
It's okay.

02:20.105 --> 02:21.094
Yeah.

02:23.676 --> 02:25.200
Uh-oh. Kiss of death.

02:31.283 --> 02:33.080
- It was so...
- You're beautiful.

02:33.152 --> 02:35.347
- Are we going to do the picture?
- All right, let's do this.

02:35.421 --> 02:36.615
Let's just do it, okay?
Okay.

02:36.689 --> 02:37.917
This time I think
we should pose.

02:37.990 --> 02:39.082
I think we should
pose for one.

02:39.158 --> 02:42.355
Oh, wait a minute, wait. Hold on for
just one second, okay? Where's Mil?

02:42.428 --> 02:44.919
Oh, God, how did we
lose her?

02:44.997 --> 02:47.090
Milly? Where are you?

02:49.235 --> 02:52.932
I'm upstairs,
with Uncle Harold's nephew.

02:53.005 --> 02:54.939
The politically-active
open-hearted journalist?

02:55.007 --> 02:57.339
Mil, let me get your sisters
in on this.

02:57.409 --> 02:58.603
Maggie, what do you do?

02:58.677 --> 02:59.735
You hit "Speaker," Mom.

02:59.812 --> 03:00.972
No, no, I know.
Okay, I knew that, but...

03:01.046 --> 03:02.638
No, but the one
that says "speak. "

03:02.715 --> 03:04.945
- Mil, we're here, we're all here.
- Hi.

03:05.017 --> 03:06.245
So how's it going?

03:06.318 --> 03:08.479
It's good.
It's good.

03:08.554 --> 03:10.351
Okay.
The only thing is

03:12.424 --> 03:14.858
I think he may have
a hot dog with a bun.

03:15.861 --> 03:17.761
Are you having a picnic? What?

03:17.830 --> 03:20.355
No. Uncircumcised is back in.

03:20.432 --> 03:23.196
You know that guy I dated
before Derek, he had a...

03:23.269 --> 03:25.737
And I preferred it because
it was so much more dramatic.

03:25.804 --> 03:27.237
When it finally made its
appearance, you were like...

03:27.306 --> 03:28.773
What's in there?

03:28.841 --> 03:30.468
Just stop it for a second.
Just a little...

03:30.542 --> 03:32.476
This is your wedding.
All right.

03:32.544 --> 03:36.446
Honey, just remember, he's
accomplished and he's considerate.

03:36.515 --> 03:39.313
And don't forget, you have one
breast smaller than the other.

03:39.385 --> 03:42.081
Thank you, Mom. God.

03:43.055 --> 03:45.649
Wait, didn't he get back
together with his wife?

03:45.724 --> 03:47.191
Oh, no.

03:48.727 --> 03:52.595
Well, Milly, congratulations
on your first wedding.

03:53.599 --> 03:56.466
Let's hope it's the first
of many. Cheers.

03:58.570 --> 03:59.935
All right.

04:01.206 --> 04:04.039
A little thyme, remember?
For hope.

04:04.109 --> 04:06.839
And they say lavender
for remembrance.

04:06.912 --> 04:08.607
But my grandmother
preferred marigolds

04:08.681 --> 04:12.048
'cause she said it made you
remember only the good stuff.

04:13.419 --> 04:17.355
I feel like making love to you

04:19.524 --> 04:21.822
My God. All right,
we gotta cut off the champagne

04:21.894 --> 04:24.294
and get some food in their
stomachs before there's an encore.

04:24.363 --> 04:27.298
Let's go ahead and get the
entrées ready, all right?

04:27.366 --> 04:28.731
Thank you.

04:33.305 --> 04:34.670
Not a good time.

04:34.974 --> 04:37.875
Honey, I was just thinking
about that brilliant

04:37.943 --> 04:41.572
but went-overboard-with-the-teeth-bleaching
flute player from Ohio.

04:41.814 --> 04:44.681
Yup, he actually stopped
by work to surprise me.

04:44.750 --> 04:45.910
- Hey.
- How sweet.

04:45.985 --> 04:48.545
He's getting to know
my staff as we speak.

04:48.620 --> 04:51.350
I guess I was wrong.
I mean, I had him pegged

04:51.423 --> 04:53.857
for one of those guys who
wants you till he's got you

04:53.926 --> 04:56.190
and then doesn't think twice about
sleeping with your best friend.

04:56.261 --> 04:58.195
You know, that kind of guy.

04:58.263 --> 05:01.198
No, no, Mom. He's great.
Beautiful, beautiful.

05:01.266 --> 05:04.997
You know, Mom, I gotta go.
We're about to serve the entrées.

05:05.070 --> 05:07.129
And I wore those shoes
that we just bought,

05:07.206 --> 05:09.003
no wonder they were on sale,
my feet are killing me.

05:09.074 --> 05:10.769
I'm gonna call you when I get
home, okay? I love you, bye.

05:17.383 --> 05:18.543
Milly.

06:05.497 --> 06:07.522
You have no messages.

06:11.737 --> 06:12.761
Oh!

06:12.838 --> 06:14.430
That's it, Cooper.

07:11.964 --> 07:14.831
Whose idea was this? A Korean spa?

07:14.900 --> 07:16.367
- Mine.
- Oy.

07:16.435 --> 07:18.801
Ma, why do you wear
the high-tops?

07:18.871 --> 07:20.463
I just got these.
What's wrong with these?

07:20.539 --> 07:21.870
They're just kind of
depressing.

07:21.940 --> 07:25.000
They're kind of something
you would wear in a hospital.

07:25.310 --> 07:27.778
Wait a sec, I'll have
you know, young ladies,

07:27.846 --> 07:30.576
that this underwear
enhances the female form,

07:30.649 --> 07:33.846
highlighting the elegance of the waist
and making the legs appear longer,

07:33.919 --> 07:36.285
instead of the...
Well, I'm sorry to say this,

07:36.355 --> 07:39.415
but the awful, you know,
foreshortening aspect of a thong,

07:39.491 --> 07:42.460
which breaks up
the body disproportionately.

07:42.528 --> 07:45.622
Mom, come on, for your 60th
birthday, we're gonna break you down

07:45.697 --> 07:46.994
and we're gonna buy you
something beautiful,

07:47.065 --> 07:48.623
something that Grandma Moses
would not wear.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.531
Yes, you are.
And speaking of your birthday,

07:50.602 --> 07:52.729
we've talked about possibly,

07:52.804 --> 07:54.669
like, a really small party. We
feel you should have a party.

07:54.740 --> 07:55.832
Not a big one.
Just intimate.

07:55.908 --> 07:56.897
Elegant...
Something very sophisticated.

07:56.975 --> 07:58.169
Because it's a really big
milestone for you, Mom.

07:58.243 --> 08:00.541
No. Misses, no. Absolutely no. Misses...

08:00.612 --> 08:03.604
No, I'm not going to talk about it,
we're not going to think about it

08:03.682 --> 08:07.413
and certainly I'm not gonna not celebrate
the fact that my life is basically over.

08:07.486 --> 08:09.852
Ma.
But I did find a recipe

08:09.922 --> 08:12.789
for a butterscotch buttercream
cake that is to die for.

08:12.858 --> 08:15.088
We got her.
Totally got her.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.788
Massage naked.
Take all clothes off.

08:17.863 --> 08:20.195
No. Not now, pal. No.

08:20.265 --> 08:21.960
No.

08:25.204 --> 08:26.569
Whose idea was this?

08:26.638 --> 08:29.129
Which one of you could possibly
think that I would ever enjoy this?

08:29.208 --> 08:32.109
No, it was not. It was so you.

08:32.177 --> 08:33.701
Just you wait.

08:33.979 --> 08:35.378
No.

08:36.081 --> 08:37.378
Hi, babe.

08:44.656 --> 08:45.816
Okay.

08:59.972 --> 09:01.667
Honey, I'm worried about you.

09:01.740 --> 09:04.971
It's not sad sobbing. I
promise, Mom, I'm fine, I'm fine.

09:05.043 --> 09:09.070
It's just the pressure point
reflex thing.

09:10.482 --> 09:11.471
Pardon?

09:11.550 --> 09:12.744
What kind of oil
would you like?

09:12.818 --> 09:14.718
Oh, wakana oh yulike
to you too.

09:14.786 --> 09:17.949
Mom.
What? It's a greeting.

09:26.565 --> 09:29.056
Hey, wait. What are you...
What are you...

09:29.234 --> 09:32.931
What are you doing here now?
Hey, that's the head. That's...

09:33.205 --> 09:36.072
Soft to hard. Soft to hard.

09:37.709 --> 09:39.267
God damn it.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.180
Oh, my God.

09:48.720 --> 09:52.121
Girls, she's not back
with Rafferty, is she?

09:52.190 --> 09:54.522
She doesn't want to
talk about it, Mom.

09:54.593 --> 09:58.427
I knew it. I thought we got rid of that
pathologically ambivalent narcissist

09:58.497 --> 10:00.965
three years ago when he almost
stood you up at Mae's wedding.

10:01.033 --> 10:02.432
Well, you know what, Mom?

10:02.501 --> 10:03.763
He's never gonna
stand me up again

10:03.835 --> 10:06.895
because he's been sleeping
with my ex-boyfriend.

10:06.972 --> 10:08.166
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.969
- I could kill him.
- Oh, God.

10:20.118 --> 10:22.143
You deserve somebody
who wants you,

10:22.220 --> 10:24.381
somebody who's as good
and as kind as you are.

10:24.456 --> 10:26.720
Why do you always
have to put me down?

10:26.792 --> 10:28.919
I'm not putting you...
Yes, you are.

10:28.994 --> 10:31.189
Love is supposed to make you
feel good about yourself.

10:31.263 --> 10:32.628
You shouldn't have to
settle for crumbs.

10:32.698 --> 10:35.565
Okay, okay. I know.
I'm an idiot, okay?

10:35.634 --> 10:37.602
- I'm done. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, no. No.

10:42.741 --> 10:45.574
All right. You're the
psychologist in the family.

10:45.644 --> 10:47.305
What do you think we should do
about your sister?

10:47.379 --> 10:50.075
I swear, with men,
she's like psychotic flypaper.

10:50.148 --> 10:53.743
They're either gay, married,
unavailable or out of their minds.

10:53.819 --> 10:57.448
No, Mom, you have to leave her alone.
You have to quit making her so insecure.

10:57.522 --> 10:59.387
She had the least
amount of time with Dad

10:59.458 --> 11:02.018
who wasn't exactly
a great male role model.

11:02.094 --> 11:05.359
And stop being a helicopter,
Mom, you're hovering.

11:08.333 --> 11:10.426
You're right, you're right.

11:11.803 --> 11:12.861
I'm gonna back off,

11:12.938 --> 11:15.907
I'm gonna give her some space
to sort things out for herself.

11:15.974 --> 11:17.100
Good.

11:18.310 --> 11:19.402
Yeah.

11:20.679 --> 11:21.976
If only I could choose
for her.

11:22.047 --> 11:23.105
No.
No. That is so...

11:23.181 --> 11:24.876
That is so
Fiddler on the Roof.

11:24.950 --> 11:26.315
Your parents
didn't choose for you.

11:26.385 --> 11:27.511
Yeah, but maybe
they should have.

11:27.586 --> 11:31.022
You know what I think?
I think you're fixating on her

11:31.089 --> 11:34.115
to avoid dealing with this very
big birthday you have coming up.

11:34.192 --> 11:36.126
I am not fixating on her.

11:36.194 --> 11:39.027
Is it crazy for me
to want her to have

11:39.097 --> 11:42.089
one healthy relationship
in her life?

11:42.167 --> 11:44.635
I mean, come on,
if she keeps up this pattern

11:44.703 --> 11:46.000
of wrong choice
after wrong choice...

11:46.071 --> 11:48.505
I mean, okay, one thing
when you're in your 20s,

11:48.573 --> 11:51.406
but 20 years later,
it's not so pretty.

11:53.345 --> 11:54.573
Maggie?

11:55.514 --> 11:56.879
I don't...

11:58.216 --> 12:00.616
I don't want her to end up
alone.

12:01.653 --> 12:03.848
You know what I realize?

12:03.922 --> 12:07.449
I give up the search. I don't
need anybody. I mean, look at Mom.

12:07.526 --> 12:10.188
She's been single most of her adult
life and she's lived a great life.

12:10.262 --> 12:14.062
So you know what? I'm going
to be just like you, Mom.

12:16.735 --> 12:18.327
Just like you.

12:21.173 --> 12:23.801
Milly, you are gonna
thank me for this later.

12:24.810 --> 12:25.970
Okay.

12:27.245 --> 12:28.906
"Adult Friend Finder. "

12:28.980 --> 12:33.610
"Over 14 million members. "
Well, that's a very good sign.

12:33.685 --> 12:35.346
I like how they use
the word "friend. "

12:35.420 --> 12:38.480
Friendship is the cornerstone
of any good relationship.

12:45.363 --> 12:49.424
Oh, my God. Oh, sorry, Coop. I'm
sorry, honey. Wait, okay. Wait. Shoot.

12:49.501 --> 12:51.867
Eat my dick.

12:52.637 --> 12:57.700
No, no, no. Be quiet, okay? Gone,
gone. All goney, right? Gone.

13:01.847 --> 13:03.144
Cooper, quiet.

13:05.517 --> 13:07.985
Gateway customer support.
May I help you?

13:08.186 --> 13:10.177
Mr. Online Support?

13:10.255 --> 13:13.986
Yeah, no. What's happened is my
computer has apparently frozen.

13:14.059 --> 13:17.961
No, I was just doing a little bit
of pre-Christmas online shopping.

13:18.029 --> 13:20.497
Why do you need to know
what site I'm on?

13:21.900 --> 13:24.460
Oh, my God.

13:27.839 --> 13:29.272
God darn.

13:29.341 --> 13:32.742
Hello, is this We Match 4 You?

13:35.347 --> 13:39.909
"Let me preface this ad by saying if you
are a nut job, pervert or fruitcake, move on.

13:39.985 --> 13:43.284
"Nudists, mama's boys, the
sexually confused need not apply. "

13:43.355 --> 13:48.054
"Anarchists, xenophobes, philistines,
masochists, sexists, bigots not welcome. "

13:48.126 --> 13:51.789
I know it's $5 a word.
No, well, don't worry.

13:52.297 --> 13:53.525
I'm not that talky.

13:53.598 --> 13:57.193
So let's just take it from
page two. "Chronically itchy. "

13:57.269 --> 14:00.568
"I'm looking for someone with a
steady job who knows the value of work.

14:00.639 --> 14:04.370
"That does not exclude
the independently wealthy. "

14:05.377 --> 14:08.403
Okay, hope that goes out...

14:08.480 --> 14:12.143
Polka dots. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I like it.

14:13.785 --> 14:14.752
I like it, I like it.

14:28.667 --> 14:29.656
Oh.

14:33.438 --> 14:37.534
Hi. You must be Daphne Wilder.
It's so nice to meet you.

14:37.609 --> 14:39.634
Let's date your daughter.

14:41.079 --> 14:43.377
I'll just dig in real quick,
'cause I'm hypoglycemic,

14:43.448 --> 14:47.145
'cause otherwise my blood sugar hits
the ground and... You know? Okay.

14:47.218 --> 14:51.416
I was just wondering what you think the
cornerstone of any good relationship is?

14:52.057 --> 14:53.388
What is in there?

14:53.458 --> 14:56.552
So why don't you just free associate,
okay? I say marriage, you say...

14:56.628 --> 14:57.686
I say marriage.

14:57.762 --> 14:59.957
No, no, I say marriage and...
I say marriage.

15:00.031 --> 15:02.158
Right, but that's not what
I meant. I meant that...

15:02.233 --> 15:03.257
I...
I...

15:03.335 --> 15:04.495
Me.
Me.

15:05.770 --> 15:09.763
I have a slight allergy
to dander and nut meats.

15:10.609 --> 15:12.600
Okay, done,
thank you very much.

15:12.677 --> 15:14.076
It's been wonderful meeting you. Thank you.

15:14.145 --> 15:17.979
Appreciate it, yeah. Right.
Thank you very much. Okay, yeah.

15:18.049 --> 15:19.914
If I say marriage,
then what do you say?

15:19.985 --> 15:21.282
Vera Wang.

15:32.197 --> 15:33.186
Your name is?

15:33.264 --> 15:34.731
Louie.
Huey.

15:40.772 --> 15:42.501
I've already got a woody.

15:44.142 --> 15:45.131
Uh!

15:47.812 --> 15:50.042
How old did you say you were?

15:56.454 --> 15:59.048
My name is Dr. Iris McDunna.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.615
I'm sorry, I'm right in the
middle here, Iris. I know.

16:01.693 --> 16:04.560
I read your ad, "You'll
know me by my polka dots. "

16:04.629 --> 16:08.759
I'm a licensed psychologist and
I wanted to offer you my services.

16:08.833 --> 16:11.700
I wanted to suggest
that as a mother,

16:11.770 --> 16:16.002
you attend, free of charge,
one of my Letting Go seminars.

16:16.074 --> 16:18.736
Hi. I think we were
supposed to meet now.

16:21.513 --> 16:23.481
Yeah. Oh, that's...

16:23.548 --> 16:24.913
Right.

16:25.717 --> 16:27.548
Right. That is so...

16:27.619 --> 16:30.747
Iris, I'm so sorry.
I can't afford to be rude.

16:31.322 --> 16:33.256
I'll leave you my card.

16:33.558 --> 16:36.288
Thank you so terribly much.

16:38.196 --> 16:41.927
God. Thank you, whoever you
are. I'll have another. Another.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.559
I really don't think I can't
get through another one of these

16:44.636 --> 16:46.263
without being
heavily medicated.

16:46.337 --> 16:48.362
That bad, huh?
Bad?

16:48.540 --> 16:50.030
Yeah. Like...

16:52.577 --> 16:53.669
Wow.

16:55.647 --> 16:58.115
And I like that you're going
for a younger guy.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.741
Me?

17:01.720 --> 17:04.086
No, no, no.
That ship's docked.

17:04.155 --> 17:07.682
No. No, this is
for my daughter.

17:11.128 --> 17:13.926
Let me get this straight. So
you're meeting these guys for her?

17:13.998 --> 17:15.021
Uh-huh.

17:15.099 --> 17:17.090
So she's cool with you
doing this for her, then.

17:17.167 --> 17:19.465
Maybe you should just
go play your guitar.

17:19.537 --> 17:21.698
She doesn't know, does she?

17:21.940 --> 17:23.031
Look.

17:24.976 --> 17:28.878
I wouldn't be here if it weren't
for the fact that Milly is...

17:28.947 --> 17:30.437
She's at a crossroads
in her life.

17:30.515 --> 17:32.983
Another hard left
and I really...

17:33.051 --> 17:37.954
She's like this person who's too
sensitive. You know what I mean?

17:38.523 --> 17:41.424
She's an innocent.
She's a pushover.

17:43.061 --> 17:44.653
I'm usually not this
in-the-muck-of-it.

17:44.729 --> 17:48.165
I mean, actually, I consider
myself a reasonably sane mother.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.701
Well, yeah,
it is a crazy love, though.

17:50.769 --> 17:54.569
I mean, who's to say I wouldn't
do the same for my own kid?

17:55.507 --> 17:56.496
Mmm.

17:56.641 --> 17:59.974
Excuse me. I'm Jason Grant.
I don't mean to interrupt.

18:00.044 --> 18:01.102
I've been waiting
over by the bar,

18:01.179 --> 18:04.637
but I only have so much time
before I have to get back to work.

18:08.086 --> 18:10.020
I just wanted to
ask you about your family.

18:10.088 --> 18:15.321
Yeah, well, my dad is an engineer
who was always a closet architect.

18:16.161 --> 18:19.494
And I grew up with a love of old
buildings. I know what you mean.

18:19.831 --> 18:23.426
So I suppose I became the architect
that he always dreamed of being.

18:23.501 --> 18:25.935
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

18:27.205 --> 18:29.036
Oh, thank you, dear Lord.

18:30.441 --> 18:31.703
Can I order you something?

18:31.776 --> 18:35.143
You know, actually it turns
out I'm so not hungry at all.

18:35.213 --> 18:39.172
Let me get you the funghi chitarrina misto.
It's the best-kept secret in the city.

18:39.250 --> 18:40.512
Can we have two orders
of that, please?

18:40.585 --> 18:43.577
And a bottle of the
Castellare Chianti Poggiale.

18:44.189 --> 18:46.851
If you insist, huh?
No, I do, I do.

18:49.027 --> 18:52.963
Do you mind my asking why a man like
you hasn't found a woman already?

18:53.631 --> 18:55.861
Well, I'll admit
I'm a bit of a workaholic.

18:55.934 --> 18:57.993
It's a very important time
in my career right now.

18:58.069 --> 19:01.129
I've found women
but just not the right one.

19:01.206 --> 19:03.140
A lot of great "almosts"
out there.

19:03.208 --> 19:05.438
Oh, yeah, a lot of "almosts. "

19:06.277 --> 19:07.403
Yeah.

19:11.516 --> 19:13.040
You speak Italian, huh?

19:13.117 --> 19:15.108
No, I fake Italian.

19:15.186 --> 19:16.346
I'd really love to learn it.

19:16.421 --> 19:18.651
You know, Milly happens to be
a phenomenal cook.

19:18.723 --> 19:20.782
She's always wanted to take
a cooking tour of Italy.

19:20.859 --> 19:23.555
Oh, wow, I was gonna go
there this fall. Really?

19:23.628 --> 19:25.118
But it's a crazy time
for me right now.

19:25.196 --> 19:28.393
My company is celebrating
their tenth anniversary.

19:28.466 --> 19:29.455
Oh.

19:29.767 --> 19:31.667
You're gonna need
a caterer then.

19:31.736 --> 19:34.864
I mean, those kinds of occasions
should be marked, don't you think?

19:37.208 --> 19:40.666
You are good. So James Bond.
Yes.

19:41.212 --> 19:43.874
Well, it was a pleasure
to meet you, Daphne Wilder.

19:43.948 --> 19:46.940
Well, Jason, my pleasure.

19:47.018 --> 19:49.145
Gotta love a woman
in polka dots.

19:49.220 --> 19:52.087
Not everyone can pull it off.
Thank you.

19:54.125 --> 19:55.149
Bye.

19:55.226 --> 19:56.557
Bye-bye.
Bye.

20:00.531 --> 20:02.522
Oh, my God.

20:03.635 --> 20:04.966
Oh, yes.

20:05.703 --> 20:07.330
And the winner is?

20:07.639 --> 20:11.075
Duh. Hands down,
bachelor number 17.

20:11.142 --> 20:12.632
Him?
Yes.

20:13.111 --> 20:14.601
Oh, I don't trust that guy.

20:14.679 --> 20:16.613
That guy was playing you
like a slide guitar.

20:16.681 --> 20:18.148
He was not.

20:18.216 --> 20:21.014
He's a very stable,
responsible, mature young man.

20:21.085 --> 20:22.450
He has empty eyes.

20:22.520 --> 20:25.614
They were not empty. And who am
I supposed to choose anyway, huh?

20:25.690 --> 20:28.682
Who do you think is better?
Me.

20:29.093 --> 20:30.253
What?

20:31.329 --> 20:32.853
I like you.

20:32.931 --> 20:36.423
And I have an odd instinct that I'd
like her too. Maybe I should meet her.

20:36.501 --> 20:39.664
Let me be perfectly honest
with you, okay?

20:40.838 --> 20:43.466
You're a very charming guy,
irresistible, in fact.

20:43.541 --> 20:45.907
And that's why I know you
would be a horrendous choice

20:45.977 --> 20:49.276
because I'm not looking for a
great affair for my daughter.

20:49.347 --> 20:51.747
You know, like, gorgeous musician
who's gonna break her heart.

20:51.816 --> 20:53.249
I'm looking for
a life partner.

20:53.318 --> 20:54.512
That's great. Thanks.

20:54.585 --> 20:58.578
Yeah, no, I love being reduced to a
cultural cliché. That's just terrific.

20:58.690 --> 21:01.921
Because only musicians
break people's hearts. Wow.

21:02.527 --> 21:03.516
Uh...

21:04.762 --> 21:07.026
It's not the only place
I have them.

21:10.668 --> 21:13.535
Well, look,
you're a great guy.

21:13.604 --> 21:15.663
I hope you have a great life.

21:15.740 --> 21:18.140
But I have to do
what's best for my daughter.

21:18.209 --> 21:19.574
Yeah, of course you do,

21:19.644 --> 21:22.112
but maybe you don't know
what's best for your daughter.

21:22.180 --> 21:23.875
I beg your pardon?

21:25.450 --> 21:26.974
Maybe you do.

21:27.352 --> 21:28.910
Maybe I do.

21:29.687 --> 21:31.678
Nice to meet you, Daphne.

21:32.924 --> 21:34.551
Pleasure. Pleasure.

21:49.307 --> 21:50.569
Here we are.

21:51.109 --> 21:52.406
Almost here.

21:52.477 --> 21:55.878
Yeah, we've landed. We're
in heaven. Oh, my God.

21:55.947 --> 21:59.280
Oh, my God. Look. Oh, God.
Mil, look at this.

21:59.350 --> 22:04.014
Mom, it's polka dots. It's so Minnie
Mouse. I don't even know if I like it. Do I?

22:04.088 --> 22:05.453
I'm hearing you hate it.

22:05.523 --> 22:07.957
Me, too.
Oh, please, just try it on.

22:08.026 --> 22:09.425
Why?

22:09.494 --> 22:11.223
Because I said so.

22:11.295 --> 22:13.126
Honey, look,
it might surprise you.

22:13.197 --> 22:15.927
Anyway, you look beautiful in dresses.
In fact, you know what I think?

22:16.000 --> 22:18.161
I think that you should wear it
to that catered affair on Sunday.

22:18.236 --> 22:20.602
To work? Mom,
I spill things all the time.

22:20.671 --> 22:23.105
Oh, come on, just try it on.
All right.

22:25.209 --> 22:27.609
Okay. That's incredible.

22:27.678 --> 22:29.543
It's not really me at all.

22:29.614 --> 22:31.775
What are you talking about?
It is totally you.

22:31.849 --> 22:33.714
Well, it's sort of
more you in a way.

22:33.785 --> 22:36.777
You know what it is, it's kind of
Aunt Jemima meets Betty Crocker.

22:36.854 --> 22:39.652
You know, that's ridiculous.

22:40.258 --> 22:41.953
Come on, sweetie,
you know what I'm going to do?

22:42.026 --> 22:44.153
I made up my mind.
I'm going to get it for you.

22:44.228 --> 22:45.889
No, no, no. You're not
getting me this dress.

22:45.963 --> 22:48.454
I don't even like it
and it's absurd for work.

22:48.533 --> 22:49.591
No.

22:54.105 --> 22:55.094
Hello.

23:08.553 --> 23:09.884
Excuse me.

23:12.590 --> 23:15.787
These meatballs
are my mom's recipe.

23:15.860 --> 23:18.556
Fantastic, I recommend
everybody try some.

23:27.305 --> 23:28.932
I love that shade of orchid.

23:29.006 --> 23:29.995
Uh-huh.

23:34.045 --> 23:35.376
Thank you, Matisse.

23:36.647 --> 23:39.810
The chicken satay has got a really
unique flavor. What'd you use?

23:39.884 --> 23:43.718
It's cumin. I'm so sorry,
I can't really chat right now.

23:43.788 --> 23:47.451
You guys, the chocolate
waterfall's not in the right spot.

23:47.525 --> 23:49.083
Oh, no, we can't have that.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.560
You know what? Let's just go ahead
and just shift everything over

23:51.629 --> 23:53.426
so it frames the temple doors.
Thank you.

23:53.498 --> 23:55.966
Yeah. That's the perfect spot.

23:57.235 --> 23:58.964
So, you like the building?

23:59.036 --> 24:00.765
I actually think
it's a little cold.

24:02.874 --> 24:05.399
I'm Jason Grant.
I'm the architect.

24:09.380 --> 24:11.610
Milly. Nice to meet you.

24:19.657 --> 24:21.682
Come on, Mom.
Pick up the phone.

24:27.031 --> 24:28.999
Oh, Daphne. Here we go. Hello.

24:29.066 --> 24:30.431
Oh, Mom, hi, it's me.

24:30.501 --> 24:32.196
I have to tell you the
most amazing thing happened.

24:32.270 --> 24:33.737
This guy at work
asked me out.

24:33.804 --> 24:35.601
He did?
Yes, he's so cute.

24:35.673 --> 24:38.198
Mom, he's an architect. We're
gonna go out Saturday night.

24:38.276 --> 24:40.608
Oh, you are? I'm just so
excited. I'm so excited.

24:40.678 --> 24:45.581
Milly, well, that is really great,
sweetie. That is so darn great.

24:45.650 --> 24:47.049
It's great, right?

24:47.118 --> 24:49.712
Mom, he's so cute, I can't even
believe that it's happening to me.

24:49.787 --> 24:51.550
And he loved the polka dots.
Thank you.

24:51.622 --> 24:53.283
Oh, yeah?
Thank you Mom. Yes.

24:53.357 --> 24:56.884
Well, honey, it's just,
I guess, dumb luck.

24:56.961 --> 24:58.553
You're the best. I love you.
Okay.

24:58.629 --> 24:59.721
Bye.
Bye.

25:01.065 --> 25:02.760
Coop, come on!

25:04.035 --> 25:05.093
Yep.

25:07.805 --> 25:11.502
Hello, Jason, this is Bond.

25:12.276 --> 25:15.871
James Bond. Call me.
I'm hearing rave reviews.

25:27.525 --> 25:30.790
All right, I just pulled up.
I'm walking in.

25:30.861 --> 25:33.159
It's okay. Don't worry.
I'm here, I'm here.

25:34.532 --> 25:36.625
Sorry, sorry.

25:36.701 --> 25:38.464
No, no, they're not angry.

25:38.536 --> 25:40.367
They're not... Hold on. Sorry.

25:40.438 --> 25:43.737
They're just... They're
probably hungry or something.

25:43.808 --> 25:48.507
Feed them the spring rolls
from the Adams wedding

25:49.614 --> 25:52.674
and the sauce
from the Levy wedding.

25:53.718 --> 25:56.380
All right, I'm walking in.
Okay, bye.

26:22.913 --> 26:25.381
There's a lot of static
out there.

26:25.449 --> 26:27.144
You can say that again.

26:27.218 --> 26:29.209
There's a lot of static
out there.

26:29.287 --> 26:32.381
You know it's caused by a
lack of humidity in the air

26:32.456 --> 26:35.482
that causes an imbalance of the
positive and negative charges.

26:35.559 --> 26:40.496
You know, ice cream is known to cut
the static cling in 98% of most cases.

26:40.564 --> 26:43.032
I love ice cream,
but I'm really late to work.

26:43.100 --> 26:46.069
And I'm so sorry.
Nice tattoo, though.

26:47.138 --> 26:48.571
What flavor?

26:51.042 --> 26:52.873
Why don't you get me
your favorite?

26:52.943 --> 26:55.173
Why don't I get your favorite?

27:00.451 --> 27:01.577
Okay.

27:03.721 --> 27:06.121
I'll have the Fudgsicle.

27:06.190 --> 27:08.556
Oh, no, no. The Dreamsicle.

27:08.626 --> 27:09.991
Wait. Is that
the tall rainbow one

27:10.061 --> 27:13.189
that's really embarrassing to
eat, but it's really, really good?

27:13.431 --> 27:14.455
Okay. Never mind.

27:14.532 --> 27:17.296
I will have the Dreamsicly one
that has the green wrapper

27:17.368 --> 27:19.529
with the Japanese writing
on it.

27:19.603 --> 27:20.934
Thank you.

27:31.115 --> 27:33.606
I'm really beginning to feel like
I'm never going to meet anyone

27:33.684 --> 27:35.777
and it's making me
feel hopeless.

27:36.187 --> 27:41.056
Well, as I've said before, Stuart,
Sheila was a huge loss, but that was 1993.

27:41.125 --> 27:42.922
Oh, it's still so fresh.

27:43.994 --> 27:45.825
This makes me feel like
when I was in the 2nd grade,

27:45.896 --> 27:48.797
and I walked around with a booger in
my nose all day and nobody told me.

27:48.866 --> 27:49.890
Why didn't they tell me?

27:49.967 --> 27:52.765
Well, more to the point, why didn't
Sheila tell you she was unhappy?

27:52.837 --> 27:54.395
Oh, God, this is making me
feel nauseous.

27:54.472 --> 27:55.996
Maybe I should change
my appointment time

27:56.073 --> 27:57.597
from Thursdays at 3:00
to Mondays at 1:00.

27:57.675 --> 27:59.233
No, Stuart,
we've tried that before.

27:59.310 --> 28:01.107
You had Fridays at 1:00
and Tuesdays at 11:00.

28:01.178 --> 28:03.043
It really didn't help
your hypoglycemia.

28:03.114 --> 28:05.309
Now let's focus
on where we ended last time.

28:05.383 --> 28:06.975
Meeting new people,

28:07.051 --> 28:09.918
joining an adult-education
class or a book club.

28:09.987 --> 28:12.114
I did go to an
Internet dating service.

28:12.189 --> 28:14.521
Good for you.
That's very brave.

28:14.592 --> 28:16.457
It was a nightmare,
Dr. Wilder-Decker.

28:16.527 --> 28:20.827
It made me want to kill myself,
even more than the last time.

28:20.898 --> 28:24.994
Wow. Well, what triggered
those feelings, Stuart?

28:26.203 --> 28:30.469
This mother put an ad out looking for a
mate for her daughter and I answered it.

28:30.541 --> 28:33.135
A mate for her daughter?

28:33.210 --> 28:35.144
Stuart, some people
really shouldn't have kids.

28:35.212 --> 28:38.443
I guess I didn't pass the test because
she made me feel about this big.

28:38.516 --> 28:39.983
Well, I wouldn't worry
about that, Stuart.

28:40.050 --> 28:42.245
Imagine how screwed up
any daughter of hers would be.

28:42.319 --> 28:44.981
And then when I pressed her as to why
I couldn't meet her precious daughter,

28:45.055 --> 28:46.955
do you know what she said? I
really hear it didn't go well.

28:47.024 --> 28:49.390
"Because I said so.
That's why. "

28:51.162 --> 28:53.926
Mother, how could you? When
are you planning on telling her?

28:53.998 --> 28:54.987
Well, why does
she need to know?

28:55.065 --> 28:57.556
I mean as long as she's happy,
that's all that's important.

28:57.635 --> 28:59.728
And, my goodness, who knows?

28:59.870 --> 29:02.065
This architect could be
the real magilla.

29:02.139 --> 29:03.333
As I've always said,

29:03.407 --> 29:07.036
"God couldn't be everywhere, and
that is why he made mothers. "

29:07.111 --> 29:09.477
What? That was on
a Hallmark card we gave you,

29:09.547 --> 29:10.912
and Milly thought
it was too corny.

29:10.981 --> 29:14.678
Don't you dare tell her, Maggie, or you
and I are gonna have some serious issues.

29:14.752 --> 29:17.414
Well, we already have
some serious issues, Mom.

29:19.056 --> 29:20.990
Always so dramatic.

29:21.058 --> 29:24.585
Mother, this is like 6th grade
drama club. Speak English.

29:32.102 --> 29:34.593
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

29:35.840 --> 29:37.239
Oh, hi, honey.

29:37.308 --> 29:38.332
Oh, Mom.

29:38.409 --> 29:40.604
I was just in the neighborhood
and I thought I'd drop by.

29:40.678 --> 29:42.976
Okay, Mom. Please,
you have to start calling me.

29:43.047 --> 29:44.981
I have a date that's
on his way over right now.

29:45.049 --> 29:46.778
Oh, but Milly,
you look so beautiful.

29:46.851 --> 29:48.682
Are you sure you want to
wear that dress, though?

29:48.752 --> 29:50.049
It was such a hit the first time. I know,

29:50.120 --> 29:51.712
but don't you think you ought
to mix it up a little bit?

29:51.789 --> 29:54.189
What for? Well, okay, you know, you're right.

29:54.258 --> 29:57.659
You're right. It looks perfect
on you and everything about it.

29:57.728 --> 30:01.255
I'm just sort of wondering, if maybe
you ought to button those buttons.

30:01.332 --> 30:03.527
No, no, I like it like this.

30:03.601 --> 30:05.569
Milly, you look like
you're asking for it.

30:05.636 --> 30:07.069
I am asking for it.

30:07.137 --> 30:10.106
Okay, all right, I'll pretend
I didn't hear that.

30:10.174 --> 30:12.108
All right, what are you
going to do with your hair?

30:12.176 --> 30:13.507
I already did it.

30:13.577 --> 30:16.171
Oh, of course you did.
Sure you did.

30:16.747 --> 30:19.773
And you're making cookies too?
That's about the sweetest touch.

30:19.850 --> 30:22.751
No, actually, I just want the house to
smell like cookies when he gets over here.

30:22.820 --> 30:25.618
Mom, it's 6:49, look. And he's
supposed to be here at 7:00.

30:25.689 --> 30:27.850
You have to go, please, please,
please. Okay. I can take a hint.

30:27.925 --> 30:29.449
It's not a hint. Mom, go.
All right.

30:29.527 --> 30:30.789
Oh, he's here. He's here.

30:30.861 --> 30:31.850
Okay, you gotta go.
All right.

30:31.929 --> 30:33.021
You gotta go please, Mom, Mom.
All right.

30:33.097 --> 30:34.894
But wait, sweetie. Just
have a good time. Okay.

30:34.965 --> 30:37.433
Feel free to be yourself, but
remember... I love you, but you gotta go.

30:37.501 --> 30:41.096
...don't be too, you know, forthcoming
with all your failed relationships.

30:41.171 --> 30:42.263
Okay, I got it.

30:42.339 --> 30:43.931
And sweetie, sweetie.
I love you.

30:44.008 --> 30:47.034
Keep that mystery alive. I love
you. I love you for some reason.

30:47.111 --> 30:48.203
Okay.

30:49.914 --> 30:52.906
I'm going to pull my hair out.
What? What, what?

30:52.983 --> 30:54.951
I know, I know.
Just one more little thing.

30:55.019 --> 30:58.352
I don't know, Mom, I gotta go.
He's here. I want you to wear this.

30:58.422 --> 31:00.754
Oh, my God. Grandma's diamond? Yeah.

31:01.358 --> 31:02.723
Put it on me, put it on me.

31:02.793 --> 31:04.158
I want to wear it tonight.
All right.

31:04.228 --> 31:05.991
Okay.
I know. I know, he's coming.

31:06.063 --> 31:08.031
Don't worry. Here we go.
Okay.

31:08.933 --> 31:12.869
Mom, you never let any of us
wear this. It's so special.

31:13.203 --> 31:14.932
So special.
Thank you.

31:16.473 --> 31:17.633
What?

31:19.176 --> 31:23.112
May it bring you luck with the architect.
Your sisters and I will expect a full report.

31:23.180 --> 31:24.169
Okay?
Okay.

31:24.248 --> 31:26.512
I'll give it to you tomorrow
night after I go out with him.

31:26.584 --> 31:27.778
Tomorrow night?
Yeah, yeah.

31:27.851 --> 31:30.012
I'm going out with
another great guy tonight.

31:30.087 --> 31:32.647
He's taking me to Luna Station
to hear some music.

31:32.723 --> 31:34.350
You are?
Can you believe that, Mom?

31:34.425 --> 31:36.154
It's like I gave up,
I stopped trying

31:36.226 --> 31:38.387
and the universe brought me
two amazing guys.

31:38.462 --> 31:40.225
Great, right? Wow.
Whoa, that's so great.

31:40.297 --> 31:41.764
It's one of those
amazing things, huh?

31:41.832 --> 31:44.801
All right, sweetie. Well now, bye. Bye-bye.

31:52.076 --> 31:53.304
Go, go.

31:53.911 --> 31:55.742
Go, Mother, go.

31:58.415 --> 31:59.973
Hi.

32:00.384 --> 32:02.409
It was either this or roses.

32:03.754 --> 32:05.085
Thank you.

32:06.590 --> 32:07.784
Come on in.
Cookies?

32:07.858 --> 32:08.847
Yeah.

32:08.926 --> 32:10.086
Nice.

32:11.996 --> 32:15.898
Really seem to have such a different
approach and attitude towards life

32:15.966 --> 32:19.629
that people don't really
get here as much, I think.

32:22.773 --> 32:25.173
Okay, don't worry. We're gonna
get a quick look at who he is

32:25.242 --> 32:26.231
and then we're gonna go home

32:26.310 --> 32:29.245
and finish watching Gary
Cooper in Love in the Afternoon.

32:36.620 --> 32:39.714
Come on, man.
Okay. Yes. Yeah.

32:41.625 --> 32:45.117
Okay. Go, go, baby.
Okay, okay.

32:50.067 --> 32:51.329
Come on.

32:55.673 --> 32:58.699
Coop, Coop, everything's okay,
sweetie. Where the heck am I?

32:58.776 --> 33:00.334
God. Okay. Oh, jeez.

33:00.411 --> 33:02.879
Okay. Let me just...
Okay, I'll turn this. Okay.

33:02.946 --> 33:05.005
Welcome, what is your destination?

33:05.082 --> 33:06.982
Luna Station.

33:07.051 --> 33:08.609
Your address is...
Is, okay, what?

33:08.686 --> 33:12.747
...1242 Amherst Boulevard.
12...

33:12.823 --> 33:14.256
So where is Amherst?

33:14.324 --> 33:17.987
Continue north 2.4 miles
and then east.

33:18.062 --> 33:19.757
Well, where is north?
The left?

33:19.830 --> 33:21.229
Continue north
2.4 miles then east.

33:21.298 --> 33:22.856
Give me a left.
Give me a right. Left. Right.

33:22.933 --> 33:24.332
Something like...

33:24.401 --> 33:25.766
Please. For God's sake.

33:25.836 --> 33:27.167
You know what you are?
Continue north 2.4 miles...

33:27.237 --> 33:28.329
I'll tell you what you are.
... and then east.

33:28.405 --> 33:29.770
You are redundant.

33:29.840 --> 33:33.173
Continue north 2.4 miles and then
east. And it's a horrible quality.

33:33.243 --> 33:35.177
You awful machine.
Continue, continue...

33:35.245 --> 33:38.840
And that's for you.
I'm sorry, command too loud.

33:59.136 --> 34:00.433
Are you guys ready to rock?

34:01.371 --> 34:03.339
- Yeah.
- All right.

34:03.407 --> 34:05.773
Let's play something
for Milly over there.

34:05.843 --> 34:07.674
A little blues in E, okay?

34:07.745 --> 34:10.077
One, two, three, four.

34:12.081 --> 34:14.141
Now we're coming up on the A.

34:18.088 --> 34:20.579
Molly, that sounds terrific.

34:23.092 --> 34:24.424
I feel really bad.

34:24.495 --> 34:28.158
No, no, I would have done the same thing
if one of my staff had called in sick.

34:28.232 --> 34:29.630
It's only gonna be
20 more minutes.

34:29.699 --> 34:31.565
It's just that they memorized
an E progression

34:31.635 --> 34:33.603
and that is a major feat
for them.

34:33.670 --> 34:34.659
Okay.

34:34.737 --> 34:36.170
Yeah, I'll be right back.

34:36.239 --> 34:37.706
Go, Nicky.

34:38.041 --> 34:39.167
Yeah.

34:40.577 --> 34:42.670
A little bit harder
over there.

34:42.746 --> 34:45.340
Strum a little bit closer,
up here.

35:05.736 --> 35:07.363
That sounds really nice.

35:07.437 --> 35:09.701
Really?
Well, thank you, teacher.

35:10.674 --> 35:14.269
Actually, I love to sing.
My whole family loves to sing.

35:15.412 --> 35:17.607
And when I was younger, I always
wanted to take piano lessons,

35:17.681 --> 35:20.115
but my mom was struggling
so much supporting us all

35:20.184 --> 35:23.415
that I just felt
way too guilty to ask.

35:24.788 --> 35:25.914
Here.

35:26.690 --> 35:27.782
What?

35:29.259 --> 35:30.419
What?

35:30.928 --> 35:33.988
Play what you were playing
before. It sounded really good.

35:34.064 --> 35:35.588
Really?
Yeah.

35:36.700 --> 35:38.531
I'm no good, but okay.

35:39.436 --> 35:40.664
Try it.

35:45.209 --> 35:46.437
Like that?
Yeah.

35:46.510 --> 35:47.499
All righty.

35:49.146 --> 35:50.807
I'll take it up here.
Okay.

35:50.881 --> 35:52.610
We'll meet in the middle.

35:52.983 --> 35:54.780
It's down there.
Sorry.

35:54.852 --> 35:57.116
How about I come close to you?

35:58.222 --> 35:59.712
I don't mind.

36:00.924 --> 36:02.255
All right.

36:06.096 --> 36:08.257
Why are there a lot of ducks
in Venice?

36:08.332 --> 36:11.062
Ten ducks are swimming
down the canal

36:11.134 --> 36:14.570
and one says,
"This place is quacked. "

36:17.140 --> 36:18.164
That's terrible.

36:18.242 --> 36:19.641
No, that's really cute,
actually.

36:19.710 --> 36:21.302
It's very cute.

36:21.378 --> 36:23.710
This is me. Come on in.

36:27.217 --> 36:31.813
I love this. It's so cozy.
Thanks.

36:32.689 --> 36:34.247
So comfy.
Yeah.

36:34.324 --> 36:36.451
Three, two, one, blast off.

36:36.526 --> 36:38.357
I'm in orbit. I'm in orbit.

36:38.428 --> 36:42.125
Okay, Lionel, let's... All
right. Okay, come back here.

36:42.199 --> 36:44.759
Let's start winding down
for bed, all right?

36:44.935 --> 36:47.165
Who are you?
What planet do you hail from?

36:47.237 --> 36:51.435
This is Milly from planet Milly.
This is Lionel from planet Johnny.

36:51.508 --> 36:53.806
Hi, Lionel,
it's very nice to meet you.

36:53.877 --> 36:55.504
You have a 'gina.

36:57.514 --> 36:59.038
I have a what?

36:59.116 --> 37:00.879
I have a penis.
You have a 'gina.

37:00.951 --> 37:03.476
Okay, buddy, give me
a break here, okay?

37:03.553 --> 37:05.020
Can I see it?
Hey.

37:06.256 --> 37:08.724
Lionel. Lionel.

37:09.893 --> 37:11.019
- Lionel.
- Dad?

37:12.129 --> 37:13.118
Hi.

37:13.230 --> 37:14.788
This is Milly.

37:16.733 --> 37:18.633
Joe Dresden. Nice to meet you.

37:18.702 --> 37:20.067
Nice to meet you.

37:20.137 --> 37:22.662
Sorry. It's moon dust.

37:24.608 --> 37:25.836
It's okay.

37:25.909 --> 37:28.400
Well, excuse me.
It's usually just us guys.

37:28.478 --> 37:33.177
Johnny hasn't brought home a gal
in, God, I don't know how long.

37:33.250 --> 37:35.582
Great, I'm getting it
from both sides.

37:36.586 --> 37:37.746
Sorry.

37:39.323 --> 37:41.314
Come on, buddy, let's you
and me go in the other room.

37:41.391 --> 37:44.292
These guys are boring.
Nope, nope, nope.

37:44.361 --> 37:47.125
What'd you have
for lunch today?

37:47.197 --> 37:48.824
Baloney sandwich.

37:48.899 --> 37:51.094
I'm not the baloney.
Yes, you are.

37:59.977 --> 38:02.309
I think we got him. There we go. We got him.

38:03.613 --> 38:05.240
We'll see you.

38:05.649 --> 38:06.911
Night.

38:15.425 --> 38:17.359
Oh, my God.

38:18.729 --> 38:21.823
Mr. Grant. This way.
Hey, man, how you doing?

38:22.332 --> 38:24.061
This is so amazing.
Yeah.

38:24.134 --> 38:26.159
It's really unbelievable.
Yeah?

38:27.671 --> 38:30.663
This is so great.
It's beautiful.

38:32.075 --> 38:33.542
It's great.

38:33.610 --> 38:34.872
I love this angle on the city.

38:34.945 --> 38:38.176
I never knew this existed.
Gosh.

38:40.183 --> 38:42.447
So what's good here?

38:42.519 --> 38:45.716
Well, I hope you don't mind,
but knowing your love of food,

38:45.789 --> 38:48.053
I didn't want you to
miss these.

38:48.125 --> 38:49.114
Oh.

38:49.459 --> 38:52.758
No, no, no, that's great

38:53.363 --> 38:55.297
'cause I make decisions
all day long.

38:55.365 --> 38:58.493
You know, the Gillespies'
daughter is allergic to chocolate,

38:58.568 --> 39:00.593
but she wants a brown cake,
and...

39:00.670 --> 39:03.696
My lease is up on my car, do I get a
hybrid? 'Cause I really believe in them

39:03.774 --> 39:07.005
but I don't know if it's time
to switch insurance, it's...

39:08.111 --> 39:12.138
What I mean is, it's very nice
to not have to think for a change.

39:21.024 --> 39:24.516
Well, last time I was in Italy, I was
in Siena, and they make this wine there,

39:24.594 --> 39:26.425
and this is the only place
in the city that serves it.

39:26.496 --> 39:29.988
You've been to Siena, right? Oh,
well, of course, I haven't. No.

39:30.067 --> 39:31.796
Are you kidding?

39:31.868 --> 39:34.837
Wouldn't it be fun to drink
our way through Tuscany?

39:34.905 --> 39:37.271
It'd be amazing.

39:37.908 --> 39:40.536
God, this calamari is so...

39:41.111 --> 39:45.138
Is that City Hall? God, I love old
buildings. You know, the attention to...

39:45.215 --> 39:47.706
Not that I don't love modern
architecture 'cause I totally do.

39:47.784 --> 39:49.581
It's so bold,
but you know what I mean.

39:49.653 --> 39:52.087
Who wants to live
in all that concrete?

39:52.722 --> 39:57.159
And yet, you know, the Zen of clean
minds, that kind of Asian simplicity,

39:57.227 --> 40:00.390
living without
all the clutter, is great.

40:04.134 --> 40:08.434
This view is amazing.
My mom would love this view.

40:08.505 --> 40:09.802
Oh, yeah?

40:10.607 --> 40:12.507
Does she have good taste?

40:13.777 --> 40:15.176
Impeccable.

40:17.814 --> 40:20.112
Now I know that this is
the part of the evening

40:20.183 --> 40:23.914
where I'm supposed to sit
way over here in this chair.

40:23.987 --> 40:27.252
But can I jump five spaces
and pass "Go"?

40:28.024 --> 40:30.322
Well, "can" implies
"are you capable. "

40:30.393 --> 40:32.953
"May" asks the question.

40:33.029 --> 40:34.519
Milly, may I?

40:35.365 --> 40:37.094
Yes, you may.

40:37.167 --> 40:39.101
Milly, may I kiss you?

40:56.153 --> 40:57.882
I'm sorry. Could you hold
that thought for a second?

40:57.954 --> 40:59.478
I have to, like...

41:03.727 --> 41:04.716
What?

41:05.162 --> 41:09.394
Well, I just got that new conference call
feature, so we thought we'd try it out.

41:09.633 --> 41:11.498
New?
Hey, Milly.

41:11.568 --> 41:13.433
Hi, how's it going?
Yes. He's a great kisser.

41:13.503 --> 41:16.768
- Wonderful. Isn't that great, girls?
- Yeah.

41:16.840 --> 41:18.501
That's so much better than...
Remember that Ted guy?

41:18.575 --> 41:19.803
He seemed to have
a lot of potential,

41:19.876 --> 41:21.400
then he ended up having, like, lizard tongue.

41:21.478 --> 41:22.467
Oh, yeah.

41:22.546 --> 41:24.639
And as I remember,
an over-intake of Mentos

41:24.714 --> 41:26.807
which didn't cover
the buffalo wing breath.

41:26.883 --> 41:28.373
That's disgusting, Mae.

41:28.451 --> 41:30.510
Though, as I recall,
those kisses bombed upstairs,

41:30.587 --> 41:32.111
but had a certain finesse
downstairs.

41:32.189 --> 41:35.158
I remember that.
Yes, downstairs and...

41:35.225 --> 41:36.715
I don't want to hear it.

41:36.793 --> 41:39.318
Guys, all right, I gotta
go kiss. I gotta go kiss.

41:39.396 --> 41:40.522
Okay, I gotta go too.
No.

41:40.597 --> 41:41.894
Me three.
Bye.

42:10.527 --> 42:11.824
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

42:13.496 --> 42:14.827
Feels good.
Yeah.

42:17.667 --> 42:18.656
Hello?

42:19.035 --> 42:20.024
Hello?

42:20.437 --> 42:21.426
Mom?

42:21.571 --> 42:23.038
No.
Are you there?

42:23.440 --> 42:24.805
Okay.
Mom?

42:24.874 --> 42:26.535
What, honey?
Mom?

42:26.910 --> 42:28.138
Are you okay?

42:28.211 --> 42:31.874
What, honey?
No, yeah. I'm fine.

42:31.948 --> 42:33.882
No, wait. Mom,
what's that sound?

42:33.950 --> 42:36.111
Well, Cooper's in heat.
Good night.

42:36.186 --> 42:38.017
Cooper's a boy. Mom?

42:41.391 --> 42:44.792
He wants potato pancakes
in the shape of footballs

42:44.861 --> 42:48.092
with Gandalf's face
on them in sour cream.

42:48.164 --> 42:50.632
We can do that.
You start, though.

42:50.734 --> 42:51.723
Hello.

42:53.103 --> 42:55.537
Hi. Wow.

42:55.605 --> 42:58.335
Lionel helped picked these.
He wanted you to know.

42:58.408 --> 43:03.175
Oh, my gosh. Thank you so
much. Lionel, they're beautiful.

43:04.047 --> 43:07.278
And you know what? You can
actually eat these flowers.

43:07.350 --> 43:08.817
They're really good in salads.

43:08.885 --> 43:11.046
Although, when I was your age,
I didn't like anything green.

43:11.121 --> 43:12.179
And now I've learned to love

43:12.255 --> 43:13.483
spinach... Now if she could just stop talking

43:13.556 --> 43:14.682
for five seconds.
... Brussels sprouts, broccoli.

43:15.859 --> 43:17.417
Oh, I got it,
I got it, I got it.

43:17.494 --> 43:19.121
No, we'll get it.
I got it.

43:20.063 --> 43:22.588
Hey, Lionel, come on, you wanna
help us eat the centerpiece?

43:22.666 --> 43:23.963
Can I, Dad?

43:24.034 --> 43:26.093
Yeah, yeah.
Go ahead. Go crazy.

43:26.169 --> 43:27.193
Bye.

43:28.004 --> 43:29.835
If you don't, I will.

43:34.844 --> 43:36.436
There was a lot going on
the other night.

43:36.513 --> 43:40.916
And I didn't get to tell you about
Lionel's unique rhythm and I'm sorry...

43:40.984 --> 43:44.420
Oh, gosh, no, it's fine. I
actually feel a kinship with him.

43:44.487 --> 43:48.446
You know he can't stop running
around and I can't stop talking.

43:48.758 --> 43:51.591
I kind of think you're gonna
have your hands full.

43:52.862 --> 43:54.489
They said it couldn't be done,
but I did it.

43:54.564 --> 43:55.826
How was your date with the...

43:55.899 --> 43:57.628
Oh, my gosh, Mom...

43:58.034 --> 44:03.028
Mom, this is Johnny. Johnny,
this is my mom, Daphne.

44:04.908 --> 44:07.433
Hi. Oh.

44:10.246 --> 44:11.270
Oh!

44:11.348 --> 44:13.612
Lionel. Johnny's son.

44:14.017 --> 44:15.416
John, is it?

44:16.686 --> 44:18.347
Lionel. Come on, buddy.

44:18.421 --> 44:19.410
Uh-huh.

44:21.925 --> 44:23.449
Lionel, come on here now.

44:23.526 --> 44:25.517
- Pardon me.
- Johnny. That's Johnny.

44:25.595 --> 44:27.529
Lionel, that's so cute.

44:28.698 --> 44:30.996
Oh, my gosh. Oh, Mom.

44:35.505 --> 44:37.996
The delivery man's here.
Is this menorah-esque?

44:38.074 --> 44:39.234
Mom, I don't even know
if this is good.

44:39.309 --> 44:41.368
Find something Hobbit-like. I
don't have anything Hobbit-like.

44:41.444 --> 44:42.672
We should try
and make this work, though.

44:42.746 --> 44:44.145
They're never gonna never know
it's from Gelson's.

44:44.214 --> 44:47.047
Oh, wait, wait.
I used this for Jason's party.

44:47.117 --> 44:49.176
Jason has such
nice eyes. Okay.

44:49.519 --> 44:50.577
Thank you.

44:51.354 --> 44:53.083
Happy Bar Mitzvah,
Josh Greenberg.

44:53.156 --> 44:54.748
How do you know Jason has
such nice eyes?

44:54.824 --> 44:58.590
Does he? Oh, that's so sweet. He
seems like a very special person.

44:58.661 --> 45:01.892
What if we try that new vase
on the coffee table?

45:02.565 --> 45:06.296
He is nice. But actually, they both
are. Oh, I'm sure they both are.

45:06.369 --> 45:08.269
But in terms of who you
wanna get serious with,

45:08.338 --> 45:11.171
that Johnny, at least from what I can
see, can't even get his life together.

45:11.241 --> 45:15.075
But I'm gonna stop, all right?
You know what's wrong?

45:15.145 --> 45:17.113
The couch is
in the wrong place. Look.

45:17.180 --> 45:18.943
I got an idea.
Okay.

45:19.015 --> 45:21.347
So we'll move the couch. Which
way? Let's move it this way.

45:21.418 --> 45:22.510
Here we go.

45:40.370 --> 45:43.339
That's so good. Okay, there
we go. I think it's good.

45:43.406 --> 45:45.931
Oh, yeah.
Oh, my God, look at that.

45:46.009 --> 45:48.978
It's so great. It, like,
completely opens the room up.

45:49.045 --> 45:50.273
So very, very, very good.
I love it.

45:50.346 --> 45:52.576
The only thing is... Can
I just say this? What?

45:52.649 --> 45:55.209
We haven't tried the couch by
the window. I think we should.

45:56.886 --> 45:59.582
All right. I don't even know if
I see it here. Okay. Oh, gosh.

45:59.823 --> 46:01.347
Just a second. Hello?

46:02.625 --> 46:06.026
You have the wrong number.
Yeah. There is no J. Bond here.

46:06.496 --> 46:10.432
FYI, the Eagle has landed.

46:10.500 --> 46:14.903
Yeah, the hen is in the house. Repeat,
the hen is in the house. Right now.

46:16.139 --> 46:17.936
All right, honey?

46:18.007 --> 46:20.032
Mil, if we push this
five inches to the left,

46:20.109 --> 46:22.134
I swear it's gonna
transform your life.

46:22.212 --> 46:24.680
You really think so?
I wouldn't lie to you.

46:24.747 --> 46:26.214
All right.
Come on, let's go.

46:26.282 --> 46:27.340
Okay, on three.
Yeah.

46:28.518 --> 46:30.281
One, two, three.

46:30.820 --> 46:33.653
Hey, it's Milly, leave me
a message. This way. Mom?

46:33.790 --> 46:36.224
Hey, Milly. It's Jason.
I was thinking about you

46:36.292 --> 46:37.987
and I wanted to say what...
Pick it up. Answer it.

46:38.061 --> 46:40.427
Does he sound wonderful or what?
Why don't you wanna talk to him?

46:40.497 --> 46:43.796
I do wanna talk to him. I just don't
wanna do it in front of you, all right?

46:43.867 --> 46:44.891
Come on, Milly,
I mean I don't...

46:44.968 --> 46:47.334
I got us tickets to the Music
Center Friday night for La Bohème.

46:47.403 --> 46:51.066
La Bohème. Oh, come on,
sweetie, I love La Bohème.

46:51.140 --> 46:53.370
Just pick up the phone. Mom,
I don't want to talk to him.

46:53.443 --> 46:56.503
It's a really interesting production...
Mil, Mil, pick up the phone.

46:56.579 --> 46:58.945
Mom, stop. No, no, no,
don't pick up the phone.

46:59.015 --> 47:01.677
Here, take it. Say yes.
Stop, stop.

47:03.653 --> 47:04.847
Hi.

47:05.922 --> 47:07.549
Yeah, I'm great.

47:08.791 --> 47:10.782
Oh, great. Yeah, okay.

47:10.960 --> 47:11.949
Mmm-hmm.

47:12.195 --> 47:14.686
That sounds really great.
Great.

47:14.764 --> 47:16.425
Yeah, great. Okay.

47:16.499 --> 47:19.332
All right.
Okay, I'll talk to you soon.

47:19.402 --> 47:21.666
Okay, great. Bye.

47:24.374 --> 47:26.137
He obviously adores you.

47:26.643 --> 47:29.510
You think so?
Oh, God, and who wouldn't?

47:29.579 --> 47:33.743
But, hon, are you aware of how many
times you used the word "great"?

47:34.751 --> 47:36.275
These candlesticks gotta go.

47:36.352 --> 47:39.583
No, no, no. I like them.
They're staying. They're great.

47:39.889 --> 47:42.983
Milly, you know how much I hate to
meddle, but I once had the choice

47:43.059 --> 47:46.654
between a mature, responsible
young man like Jason,

47:46.729 --> 47:49.755
and your father, who, of
course, I was infatuated with.

47:49.832 --> 47:51.766
And to this day...
Okay, okay.

47:51.834 --> 47:52.926
You know what?

47:53.002 --> 47:55.835
To be fair, you're reading a lot into
a guy that you've met for ten minutes.

47:55.905 --> 48:00.137
Truth be told, that Johnny has
heartbreak written all over his face.

48:00.209 --> 48:03.667
No, no, no. Truth be told, you
know absolutely nothing about him.

48:03.746 --> 48:05.907
And know what, Mom? I gotta go
'cause I'm getting my bangs cut.

48:05.982 --> 48:07.609
What?
No, no, you go ahead.

48:07.684 --> 48:08.810
No, that's okay, you go ahead.

48:08.885 --> 48:09.874
Yes.
Fine.

48:09.953 --> 48:11.818
Cut your bangs and quit
hiding your incredible eyes.

48:11.888 --> 48:14.686
To be truthful, you know nothing
about him. He's actually a good parent.

48:14.757 --> 48:16.782
Hiding your incredible eyes.
I can't do this.

48:16.859 --> 48:20.727
Milly, I love you and you may be
brilliant, but you're not smart.

48:20.797 --> 48:23.095
I just want you to
have a full, beautiful life.

48:23.166 --> 48:25.794
Do I not have a life, Mom?
Because I thought I had a life.

48:25.868 --> 48:27.961
No. No, you have a career,
you have a car

48:28.037 --> 48:30.369
and you have a loft
you pay way too much rent for.

48:30.440 --> 48:31.464
That's not a life.

48:31.541 --> 48:35.739
Milly, I'm your mother. I love
you enough to tell you the truth.

48:35.812 --> 48:38.610
Your version of the truth, Mom. No. No.

48:38.681 --> 48:42.208
The truth is, happiness
is a series of choices.

48:42.285 --> 48:44.048
It's not something
that just sort of happens.

48:44.120 --> 48:47.214
One wrong decision
can change your whole life.

48:49.359 --> 48:51.190
There's still time, Mom.

48:51.260 --> 48:53.285
Not if you waste
another minute of it.

48:53.363 --> 48:55.661
I mean for you.

48:59.702 --> 49:02.694
And I don't say
"great" too much.

49:06.309 --> 49:08.470
This is great.
This is great.

49:08.878 --> 49:12.041
The view is great.
The night is just so great.

49:12.115 --> 49:13.810
You warm enough?
You wanna go inside?

49:13.883 --> 49:16.215
No, no, no, I'm fine.
I'm nice and toasty.

49:16.285 --> 49:17.309
Okay, all right.

49:17.387 --> 49:22.324
And don't you just love my mom's
orange blossom cheesecake? So good.

49:22.392 --> 49:24.257
Get a big bite.
Wow.

49:25.795 --> 49:27.786
It's great, right?

49:28.297 --> 49:32.893
It's superb, which is a synonym for
great, if you're ever looking for one.

49:34.804 --> 49:38.205
You know, you're cold.
Let's go inside.

49:38.274 --> 49:39.639
You get the candle,
I'll get the rest.

49:39.709 --> 49:41.074
Let me grab that.

49:41.544 --> 49:43.637
Be careful with that. I'm
sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

49:43.713 --> 49:44.771
I'm so sorry.

49:44.847 --> 49:47.111
Oh, my gosh, please tell me
where I can get you another one...

49:47.183 --> 49:49.947
You can't.
It's my great-grandmother's.

49:50.219 --> 49:52.244
Oh, my God. Jason.

49:52.889 --> 49:55.255
I don't know
what to say. I'm sorry.

49:55.324 --> 49:56.916
Please, I'm just,
I've been so out of it lately.

49:56.993 --> 49:59.962
My alarm clock didn't go off
today and that's why I was late

50:00.029 --> 50:02.293
and I've just been so stressed
with the Greenberg Bar Mitzvah,

50:02.365 --> 50:03.889
but that's a whole...

50:05.268 --> 50:08.465
You just seem really angry.

50:09.539 --> 50:10.801
Nope.

50:11.708 --> 50:13.039
I'm great.

50:19.382 --> 50:20.508
Okay.

50:23.586 --> 50:26.146
I promise you they're the
best chocolate soufflés ever.

50:26.222 --> 50:27.849
Well, they better be.
They're worth it.

50:27.924 --> 50:29.357
Touchdown.

50:30.326 --> 50:32.658
Oh, my gosh, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

50:32.729 --> 50:35.027
Hey, it's all right.
That's all right.

50:35.832 --> 50:38.392
I'm sorry. I bumped into,
like, a parking meter yesterday

50:38.468 --> 50:40.163
and I'm always breaking stuff.

50:40.236 --> 50:43.103
Why are you apologizing?
It isn't even your fault.

50:43.172 --> 50:46.869
Lionel, put some shoes on before
you come back in here, all right?

50:47.310 --> 50:51.337
Look, I know he can be a lot and it gets
a little crazy around here sometimes.

50:51.414 --> 50:54.747
But here you are making us chocolate
soufflés and you're apologizing.

50:54.817 --> 50:58.446
Sometimes, I think you let people
make you feel bad about yourself.

50:58.521 --> 51:00.853
Yeah, like you are right now?

51:03.726 --> 51:05.887
What is going on
with us today?

51:05.962 --> 51:07.987
We're having an off day,
that's all.

51:12.135 --> 51:13.727
What are you doing?
I'm leaving.

51:13.803 --> 51:15.498
I'm leaving because
you're miserable

51:15.571 --> 51:17.562
and we're having a bad day.
You just admitted it.

51:17.640 --> 51:19.005
No, I said "off day. "

51:19.075 --> 51:20.667
And, yes,
we've had better days,

51:20.743 --> 51:22.768
and I'm sure we'll have
a few hundred more weird ones

51:22.845 --> 51:24.745
if we stay together. So what?

51:27.250 --> 51:28.410
Johnny.
Give me your hand.

51:28.484 --> 51:30.850
What? I'm going to try something here.

51:31.554 --> 51:34.648
What are you doing?
Just a little something.

51:42.331 --> 51:43.355
Oh.

51:43.432 --> 51:45.559
The soufflés are done.
No, the timer didn't go off.

51:45.635 --> 51:48.798
No, no. I feel it.
I feel it. Watch.

51:58.681 --> 52:00.808
Those look beautiful.
Thank you.

52:00.883 --> 52:03.613
The one thing I can
actually do right.

52:05.555 --> 52:08.388
You have perfect timing.
Thank you.

52:09.225 --> 52:10.556
Come here.

52:14.163 --> 52:15.824
Don't apologize.

52:18.401 --> 52:20.699
He has this way
of calming me down.

52:20.770 --> 52:23.136
A huge plus.
Yeah.

52:24.273 --> 52:25.467
But then the whole
Lionel thing.

52:25.541 --> 52:29.739
I just worry and wonder, would
I be a good mother to him?

52:29.812 --> 52:31.803
Don't worry.
It's not genetic.

52:34.417 --> 52:36.977
They've been through
so much, though,

52:37.053 --> 52:41.547
with Lionel's mom, like, freaking out
and splitting when he was so young.

52:42.658 --> 52:45.491
I don't know, not that we're anywhere
near talking about any of this yet.

52:45.561 --> 52:48.928
Just the fact that you're
wondering, though. God.

52:49.332 --> 52:53.359
I mean the fact is you don't know
either of these guys that well.

52:54.136 --> 52:56.127
Who knows if Jason
even wants to have kids?

52:56.205 --> 52:57.536
Absolutely.

52:58.274 --> 52:59.673
Four kids.

52:59.742 --> 53:01.676
And I wanna name the first
one Charlie after my father

53:01.744 --> 53:03.405
and that works
if it's a boy or a girl.

53:03.479 --> 53:07.313
Then I want to design a huge
Craftsman house for the whole brood.

53:07.383 --> 53:08.441
The exhibit's in here.

53:08.517 --> 53:11.782
Oh, no, no, no. Don't let me in
the museum. Too many breakables.

53:11.854 --> 53:14.118
Don't worry. They're insured.

53:15.291 --> 53:16.724
Hey, listen.

53:17.660 --> 53:20.754
I'm sorry I lost my temper
with you the other day.

53:20.830 --> 53:22.923
You felt bad enough already.

53:23.799 --> 53:26.632
I can be a real ass
and I hate that about myself.

53:31.908 --> 53:33.876
Another family heirloom.

53:44.820 --> 53:47.345
He buys jewelry. Well, it's
a no-brainer. He's the one.

53:47.423 --> 53:50.085
- He felt remorse, Mae.
- Well, that's a lovely quality.

53:50.159 --> 53:52.719
No, he knew he should feel
remorse. Oh, my God, Milly.

53:52.795 --> 53:53.853
Those empanadas are amazing.

53:53.930 --> 53:56.660
They're gonna be perfect for
Mom's party. Oh, my party.

53:56.732 --> 53:59.963
Mom, what about these for
your party? Oh, shoes, please.

54:00.036 --> 54:02.834
Why are you making such a big
deal over this dreaded event?

54:02.905 --> 54:04.839
Why are we celebrating
my descent into oblivion?

54:04.907 --> 54:07.375
Come on, Mom. It's not
that bad. Snap out of it.

54:07.443 --> 54:11.709
Well, I mean, it is a milestone, and
actually, I am taking stock of my life

54:11.781 --> 54:14.443
and trying to find some
peace and quiet in my old age,

54:14.517 --> 54:17.850
so, Milly, will you please
bring Jason to the party?

54:18.120 --> 54:21.487
I would just love to meet him.
That's all I'm asking.

54:21.557 --> 54:23.889
I understand, but isn't
it my choice who I bring?

54:23.960 --> 54:25.757
I think it is.
Thank you.

54:25.928 --> 54:27.589
All right.

54:27.964 --> 54:29.124
Okay.

54:32.134 --> 54:33.192
Oh.

54:38.207 --> 54:40.038
Oh, my God.

54:40.109 --> 54:43.738
Mom, Eli says that's what
I say right before I...

54:43.813 --> 54:45.440
No kidding? Me, too.

54:45.514 --> 54:46.811
And, you know, it was funny,

54:46.882 --> 54:49.180
the other night, we hadn't had
sex in so long, by the third one,

54:49.251 --> 54:51.515
I was setting off the car
alarms in the neighborhood,

54:51.587 --> 54:52.815
and dogs were barking...

54:52.888 --> 54:55.118
Three? Is that normal?

54:55.191 --> 54:57.659
Please. Everyone knows I hold
the record in this family.

55:02.865 --> 55:04.662
Why are you so quiet?

55:06.168 --> 55:08.363
'Cause she's doing the
Oompa-Loompa with two guys, Mom.

55:08.437 --> 55:10.428
Stop it.
What?

55:10.639 --> 55:11.970
Wait a minute.

55:12.074 --> 55:14.838
At this point, are you doing
it with both of them at once?

55:14.910 --> 55:17.242
No. I'm not. Absolutely not.

55:27.056 --> 55:30.719
Honey, I've been thinking
about your situation with Jason.

55:31.193 --> 55:34.526
Mom, I didn't ask for this.
It happened to me.

55:41.070 --> 55:43.061
So move on.

55:54.817 --> 55:56.341
No. It happened to you.

55:56.419 --> 56:00.480
Things have gotten so out of
hand I broke my first bundt cake.

56:11.434 --> 56:13.766
Has anybody seen my G.I. Joe?

56:13.836 --> 56:15.497
Believe me, it's not in here.

56:15.938 --> 56:17.405
I left it on the bed.

56:17.473 --> 56:18.838
...that it happened to you.

56:18.908 --> 56:21.775
You're making me hate you and I
don't ever want to see your face...

56:24.547 --> 56:25.980
With that Johnny...

56:28.084 --> 56:30.143
Happy birthday, Mom.

56:30.219 --> 56:31.243
Happy birthday, Mom.
Happy birthday.

56:31.320 --> 56:33.584
Your favorite butterscotch cake. We made it.

56:33.656 --> 56:35.920
- Well, some of us made it.
- We helped, okay?

56:36.325 --> 56:37.883
It's really yummy. I tried some. All right.

56:37.960 --> 56:39.894
Make a wish, make a wish.
Make a wish, Mom.

56:39.962 --> 56:41.953
Come on, make a wish, make a
wish. Make a wish, make a wish.

56:57.713 --> 56:59.772
Happy birthday.
We love you, Mom.

56:59.849 --> 57:02.283
I'd like to propose a toast.

57:02.351 --> 57:05.286
To the incredibly unique
Daphne Wilder,

57:05.354 --> 57:10.656
the fearless leader of the Wilder
women, who I hope to someday call family.

57:11.327 --> 57:13.022
You've created
a wonderful family,

57:13.095 --> 57:15.563
and I hope when my folks
stop through town,

57:15.631 --> 57:18.395
that Milly'll charm them
as much as she's charmed me.

57:19.502 --> 57:20.799
Cheers.

57:20.870 --> 57:22.633
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

57:22.705 --> 57:24.400
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

57:24.473 --> 57:26.202
Thank you so much.

57:26.275 --> 57:28.072
Thank you, thank you.

57:28.144 --> 57:31.409
What was that exactly? Did
you know he was gonna do that?

57:32.815 --> 57:35.409
Did he just propose? Because
I think he just proposed.

57:35.484 --> 57:37.748
I think he did.
The question is, to who?

57:37.820 --> 57:40.414
Maggie, stop being a killjoy. All
right, girls, what do you think?

57:40.489 --> 57:42.389
He seems well-read.
He's tall.

57:42.458 --> 57:44.722
Okay, you guys don't like him at
all. Don't listen to your sisters.

57:44.793 --> 57:46.954
For God's sake, sweetie,
do not listen to them.

57:47.029 --> 57:48.053
Here's what I'm thinking.

57:48.130 --> 57:50.325
I'm thinking his parents
are from Connecticut.

57:50.399 --> 57:51.696
They're a little conservative,

57:51.767 --> 57:54.065
so maybe you should
just wear your pleated skirt.

57:54.136 --> 57:56.570
Just this once, honey?
Stop.

57:56.639 --> 57:59.073
It's just a gesture, just
make them more comfortable.

57:59.141 --> 58:02.577
I understand it's a gesture but,
Mom, this is moving very quickly.

58:02.645 --> 58:05.671
He just said all of this.
It's... Milly, don't fight it.

58:05.748 --> 58:06.908
This is the way
it's supposed to be.

58:06.982 --> 58:08.677
You're just not used
to feeling pursued and adored.

58:09.118 --> 58:11.018
I hate pleated skirts.

58:11.487 --> 58:14.251
Isn't this about the time
we were going to sing?

58:14.323 --> 58:16.587
That's a great idea. Come on, Mils. Yes, yes.

58:18.761 --> 58:20.922
Well, I met him on a Sunday

58:20.996 --> 58:22.293
My voice.

58:27.803 --> 58:31.295
And I missed him on Monday

58:35.477 --> 58:37.342
Not bad. What do you
got going, Mom?

58:37.413 --> 58:40.712
And I dated him Wednesday

58:46.555 --> 58:48.182
I said bye-bye, baby

58:48.257 --> 58:49.724
Nice.
Yes.

59:01.337 --> 59:03.771
Milly? Will you take
the soprano?

59:06.775 --> 59:08.606
You know, that's it.
That's it.

59:08.677 --> 59:10.838
No, no. You're so
out of control.

59:10.913 --> 59:12.005
What'd I do this time?

59:12.081 --> 59:13.981
You're forcing me. Jason's
here. You're making me...

59:14.049 --> 59:16.540
So, Jason, can I get you
another one of these?

59:16.619 --> 59:17.608
Will I need one?

59:17.686 --> 59:19.551
Oh, yeah.
They're just getting started.

59:19.622 --> 59:21.055
Who wants lavender ice cream?

59:21.123 --> 59:22.488
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

59:22.558 --> 59:25.288
You're not gonna go. You're
out of control. Milly's right.

59:25.361 --> 59:27.761
I don't know how she can take it.
I can't. I can't take it anymore.

59:27.830 --> 59:32.824
Well, excuse me for just one moment
here. I thought that this was my birthday.

59:32.901 --> 59:35.529
My very big, special birthday.

59:35.604 --> 59:37.231
Yes, Mom. It's your big,
special birthday.

59:37.306 --> 59:38.330
That's how you should remember

59:38.407 --> 59:39.567
you're too old...
Old?

59:39.642 --> 59:42.509
Not too old, but too old
to be doing this to Milly.

59:42.578 --> 59:44.478
You're pushing her like you
pushed her into Girl Scouts.

59:44.546 --> 59:46.275
Thank you very much.
I'm not ten years old anymore.

59:46.348 --> 59:47.406
You have to stop.
Yeah.

59:47.483 --> 59:48.677
You have to change
at some point.

59:48.751 --> 59:53.381
Fine. But I just want you girls to
understand something about motherhood, okay?

59:53.455 --> 59:54.615
Mom.

59:54.690 --> 59:55.748
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay.

59:55.824 --> 59:58.554
I mean, it is the most
impossible love.

59:58.627 --> 01:00:02.119
You tell me when it ends.
You tell me when it stops.

01:00:02.197 --> 01:00:07.464
All I know is, it's absolutely fine for
me to teach you how to walk and talk,

01:00:07.536 --> 01:00:11.700
and then you grow up and you head off
in the wrong direction toward a cliff.

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:14.675
And I'm supposed to just
stand there and wave and go,

01:00:14.743 --> 01:00:19.237
"Well, kids, good luck. It's Mom.
I'm here. " Well, I can't do that.

01:00:20.015 --> 01:00:22.279
What am I supposed to do, huh?

01:00:22.351 --> 01:00:27.448
Am I supposed to just put my feet up
at the end of the day and say to myself,

01:00:27.523 --> 01:00:33.393
"Well, you know, they're on their
own and she says she's fine. "

01:00:33.462 --> 01:00:34.554
Well, you won't be.

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:36.291
Just stop it. God damn it.

01:00:36.365 --> 01:00:38.595
You are making me crazy
and you're never gonna change

01:00:38.667 --> 01:00:40.225
'cause you don't even know
when you're doing it.

01:00:40.302 --> 01:00:42.930
Oh, well, I am gonna stop
as in right now.

01:00:43.005 --> 01:00:48.033
So, let me tell you, I am washing
my hands of your emotional problems.

01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:52.877
I'm just a visitor with a
limited day pass from here on in.

01:00:52.948 --> 01:00:55.508
Oh, my God, I can't even talk.

01:00:55.584 --> 01:00:56.573
Mom.

01:00:59.922 --> 01:01:00.911
Oh, my...
Great.

01:01:00.989 --> 01:01:04.254
She loses her voice and we are
three days from Hungarian flu.

01:01:04.326 --> 01:01:06.294
You guys, the last time
I had her at my house,

01:01:06.362 --> 01:01:08.660
Derek and I were in therapy for
two months. I can't do it with this.

01:01:08.731 --> 01:01:11.256
No, no, no. I know it's my turn
technically, but you cannot...

01:01:11.333 --> 01:01:13.267
We can't be in the same room
together right now.

01:01:13.335 --> 01:01:15.132
Rock, Paper, Scissor.

01:01:15.604 --> 01:01:17.868
Rock, Paper...
Fine, fine, fine.

01:01:18.107 --> 01:01:19.574
Hi. Oh, Ma, I'll take that.

01:01:19.641 --> 01:01:22.132
We know you're about to get sick,
so we're gonna Rock, Paper, Scissors

01:01:22.211 --> 01:01:23.576
to see whose house
you're gonna stay at.

01:01:23.645 --> 01:01:25.909
'Cause you know what, Mom?
We all want you to stay.

01:01:25.981 --> 01:01:27.278
We're fighting for you.

01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:29.874
Let's declare, guys. Please?
Okay.

01:01:36.792 --> 01:01:39.784
Oh, you win, Mils.
That's great.

01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:43.326
Have fun, you guys.

01:01:44.633 --> 01:01:45.463
What for?

01:01:45.534 --> 01:01:49.197
'Cause I'm here with you.
Women prefer him, as a rule.

01:01:50.005 --> 01:01:51.802
Shall we take a walk?

01:01:52.608 --> 01:01:53.939
Yes, let's.

01:01:54.243 --> 01:01:55.335
What?

01:01:55.477 --> 01:01:56.569
Where is he now?

01:01:56.645 --> 01:01:59.808
"You don't need to
take care of me. "

01:02:00.282 --> 01:02:04.082
"Go out and have fun
with Jason. "

01:02:05.087 --> 01:02:07.282
No. No. Why?

01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:11.789
"Because I said so. "

01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:14.789
No. I'm not leaving.

01:02:14.863 --> 01:02:18.321
They say dogs feel disoriented
when they get debarked.

01:02:20.936 --> 01:02:22.301
You're nice, too.

01:02:22.838 --> 01:02:23.827
No.

01:02:25.474 --> 01:02:27.101
Yes.
No, please.

01:02:30.979 --> 01:02:34.437
"Now there was a man
who knew how to be a man. "

01:02:34.516 --> 01:02:35.505
Mmm-hmm.

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:39.621
"There's turkey meatloaf
in the fridge. "

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:43.483
"What's an orgasm feel like?"

01:03:03.111 --> 01:03:04.373
Amazing?

01:03:05.013 --> 01:03:07.481
I don't know. Amazing, and...

01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:08.777
Like...

01:03:10.652 --> 01:03:13.485
Like being
totally out of control.

01:03:14.256 --> 01:03:15.655
Just like...

01:03:19.428 --> 01:03:21.396
"No, I wouldn't like that. "

01:03:21.463 --> 01:03:24.921
Yes, you would. Oh, Mom, no, no,
no. It's not like being drunk.

01:03:25.267 --> 01:03:28.600
It's just satisfying and...

01:03:30.706 --> 01:03:32.264
Like you're out of your body,

01:03:32.341 --> 01:03:35.868
but you're in your body,
and your toes curl under...

01:03:35.944 --> 01:03:39.436
That doesn't sound delicious, I know,
but, God, it's so delicious, Mom.

01:03:39.515 --> 01:03:42.245
And you can laugh or cry,
but like a good cry.

01:03:42.317 --> 01:03:44.877
I mean, I've cried before.
It's just like...

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:52.921
You know, just...

01:03:53.862 --> 01:03:56.353
Oh, my God, I can't believe
I just said that to you.

01:03:56.431 --> 01:03:59.992
I'm not explaining it right.
I'm not explaining it right.

01:04:02.571 --> 01:04:05.039
Didn't you ever
have one with Dad?

01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:12.776
"He said he didn't have all
day and he worked nights. "

01:04:21.423 --> 01:04:22.754
Oh, Mom.

01:05:14.943 --> 01:05:16.934
"Don't tell your sisters
I asked. "

01:05:59.087 --> 01:06:00.281
Hello?

01:06:00.889 --> 01:06:02.857
No, I'm sorry. She can't
come to the phone right now.

01:06:02.924 --> 01:06:04.755
Can I take a message?

01:06:06.995 --> 01:06:09.589
You're calling about
the personal ad?

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.192
Are you sure that you have
the right number?

01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:17.500
Yeah, Daphne Wilder.

01:06:18.607 --> 01:06:20.905
Okay. Bye-bye.

01:06:23.612 --> 01:06:26.342
Just a little belated birthday gift.

01:06:27.249 --> 01:06:28.238
You like it?

01:06:28.316 --> 01:06:31.843
See, it brought me luck, so I
thought maybe it would bring you luck.

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.911
Oh, do you like it, Mom?

01:06:34.756 --> 01:06:37.247
Mom? I know.

01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:42.096
I know all about
your little ad.

01:06:42.164 --> 01:06:43.995
And I think it's so great.

01:06:44.066 --> 01:06:46.899
It's so bold
and so brave of you

01:06:46.968 --> 01:06:49.436
and finally it shows me that you
heard us at your birthday party.

01:06:49.504 --> 01:06:51.131
You're trying to live
your own life.

01:06:51.206 --> 01:06:52.696
And I want you to know, Mom,

01:06:52.774 --> 01:06:56.540
you don't have to go through the personals
to find love, 'cause that can be so...

01:06:56.611 --> 01:06:58.044
Terrifying.

01:07:01.216 --> 01:07:05.414
Jason's uncle is coming into
town next week with his parents

01:07:05.487 --> 01:07:07.182
and he's dying
to meet you, Mom.

01:07:07.255 --> 01:07:09.519
Jason says he's, like, the most
amazing guy in the entire world

01:07:09.591 --> 01:07:11.422
and I haven't even
really told him about the...

01:07:11.493 --> 01:07:13.893
All right, all right, fine.
Fine.

01:07:16.598 --> 01:07:18.589
Why didn't you marry?

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:21.534
I didn't know what the war
was like then.

01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:24.261
If I had it to do over again,
I'd marry him.

01:07:26.675 --> 01:07:29.007
When I joined up,
I remember...

01:07:35.684 --> 01:07:36.776
Hello.

01:07:36.852 --> 01:07:39.013
Is this Milly Wilder's home?

01:07:40.288 --> 01:07:43.121
I'm Joe Dresden,
I'm Johnny's father.

01:07:44.159 --> 01:07:45.956
Are you Milly's mom?

01:07:50.766 --> 01:07:53.326
This is Lionel,
this is Johnny's boy.

01:07:55.270 --> 01:07:56.259
"Daphne. "

01:07:57.439 --> 01:07:59.999
"Can't talk. "
Well, it's overrated.

01:08:02.010 --> 01:08:03.705
Sign? Do you sign?

01:08:09.017 --> 01:08:10.507
"Laryingitis. "

01:08:11.253 --> 01:08:14.120
Laryngitis. That's the
alternate spelling, I guess.

01:08:14.189 --> 01:08:16.987
I know Johnny had a date with Milly
tonight and I was hoping to catch him.

01:08:17.058 --> 01:08:18.423
I can't reach him
on his cell phone.

01:08:18.493 --> 01:08:23.897
I stupidly misplaced my keys and
I can't get back into our house.

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:45.447
They're beautiful.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:48.751
Three girls, huh?
And all by yourself.

01:08:49.057 --> 01:08:51.287
That couldn't have been easy.

01:08:52.594 --> 01:08:55.825
Yeah, yeah, I know,
but still, it had to be tough.

01:09:00.001 --> 01:09:02.094
"There's tougher things. "

01:09:02.170 --> 01:09:05.139
Yeah, like trying
to give you a compliment.

01:09:10.078 --> 01:09:13.707
You know, what could be good for that throat

01:09:13.782 --> 01:09:16.341
is a couple of drops
of brandy.

01:09:17.618 --> 01:09:20.281
Mine's feeling
a little scratchy, too.

01:09:33.602 --> 01:09:34.761
Shall we take a walk?

01:09:34.836 --> 01:09:36.428
We could get along.

01:09:36.504 --> 01:09:37.528
Couldn't we?

01:09:38.673 --> 01:09:41.038
You're sweet.
No, I'm not.

01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:42.872
Yes, you're a dear.

01:09:44.179 --> 01:09:45.703
What are you
thinking about now?

01:09:45.779 --> 01:09:49.216
About how nice it is.
And you're nice, too.

01:09:55.056 --> 01:09:57.524
Besides,
you're so very beautiful.

01:09:59.961 --> 01:10:03.328
I'd be very glad to have you
kiss me now if you don't mind.

01:10:07.869 --> 01:10:09.996
Women prefer him,
as a rule.

01:10:17.078 --> 01:10:19.308
Where is he now?
Who?

01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:22.544
The boy you're engaged to.
He's dead.

01:10:26.321 --> 01:10:29.347
He was killed in the Somme.

01:10:29.424 --> 01:10:31.153
Were you engaged long?

01:10:31.226 --> 01:10:32.887
Eight years.
We grew up together.

01:10:33.561 --> 01:10:37.258
Why didn't you marry? I didn't
know what the war was like then.

01:10:40.702 --> 01:10:43.671
If I had it to do over again,
I'd marry him.

01:10:49.644 --> 01:10:52.010
When I joined up, I remember
having this silly idea

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:54.708
that he might come
to the hospital where I was.

01:11:16.871 --> 01:11:20.671
Now we've got our basic tomato sauce.
I took out about two-thirds of it,

01:11:20.742 --> 01:11:22.300
because if there's
any mistake

01:11:22.377 --> 01:11:26.370
that American cooks make
when they're cooking pasta,

01:11:26.448 --> 01:11:28.439
is that they tend to
over-sauce it.

01:11:28.516 --> 01:11:30.074
They put too much stuff on.

01:11:30.151 --> 01:11:31.880
In Italy, the main event
is the noodle

01:11:31.953 --> 01:11:35.218
and the rest is just the dressing,
very much like we dress salads.

01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:38.316
Now, I've got it in there.
I'm allowing it to start...

01:11:44.833 --> 01:11:46.095
Hello.

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.298
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:11:57.545 --> 01:11:58.534
Hi.

01:11:59.614 --> 01:12:00.945
Hi.

01:12:01.016 --> 01:12:03.348
We were worried sick
about you.

01:12:03.985 --> 01:12:07.512
It's nice to see you again, Milly. You, too.

01:12:08.023 --> 01:12:09.513
It's a great night, isn't it?

01:12:09.591 --> 01:12:11.957
- It's one for the books.
- Yeah.

01:12:13.428 --> 01:12:15.259
She has a 'gina, too.

01:12:15.964 --> 01:12:17.124
Lionel.

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.062
As Grants,

01:12:20.602 --> 01:12:23.093
we Grant you health,
we Grant you happiness,

01:12:23.171 --> 01:12:26.140
we Grant you someone else
to water your plants.

01:12:26.841 --> 01:12:27.830
Cheers.

01:12:29.277 --> 01:12:30.869
Definitely.
Cheers.

01:12:30.945 --> 01:12:32.378
Reggie's the toast giver.

01:12:32.447 --> 01:12:34.278
He's the real talker in the family. I see.

01:12:34.349 --> 01:12:36.283
Can somebody get me another
bourbon and soda on the rocks?

01:12:36.351 --> 01:12:38.046
Oh, no, no, no,
you can't order bourbon...

01:12:38.119 --> 01:12:40.781
They seem to be
hitting it off.

01:12:40.855 --> 01:12:42.186
Definitely. Yeah.

01:12:43.191 --> 01:12:46.217
Beautiful. I don't think so. And then
I want you to try the buffalo filet

01:12:46.294 --> 01:12:47.989
while we're here.
Yeah.

01:12:48.063 --> 01:12:50.964
You know, the buffalo was an endangered
species up until a couple of years ago

01:12:51.032 --> 01:12:52.090
and now we're eating them.

01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:53.930
Isn't this great, Mom?

01:12:56.304 --> 01:12:57.896
...and you look out
over the fields

01:12:57.972 --> 01:13:00.839
and what you see are herds
of commercial buffalo.

01:13:00.909 --> 01:13:03.036
And then you also see
herds of...

01:13:03.611 --> 01:13:06.580
I had a great time. Please tell
your parents good night for me, okay?

01:13:06.648 --> 01:13:08.673
Good night.
Good night.

01:13:17.325 --> 01:13:20.158
Tell me you're not seeing
that guy. Are you, Milly?

01:13:21.296 --> 01:13:23.093
Yes, but I don't...

01:13:23.164 --> 01:13:25.359
Actually, the "yes"
is all I needed to know.

01:13:25.433 --> 01:13:28.197
No, no, no, but the "but"
part's really important too.

01:13:28.269 --> 01:13:30.203
But what? Not him.

01:13:30.839 --> 01:13:31.828
Why?

01:13:31.906 --> 01:13:34.807
'Cause he looks like some guy
your mother would love.

01:13:34.876 --> 01:13:35.934
Johnny, wait, though.

01:13:36.010 --> 01:13:38.171
This is really difficult for me
and I've never been here before.

01:13:38.246 --> 01:13:39.508
I don't know how to
navigate this.

01:13:39.581 --> 01:13:42.675
Oh, poor thing.
Don't talk to me that way.

01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:44.308
Oh, I'm sorry.
What was I thinking?

01:13:44.385 --> 01:13:47.684
You're involved with this guy to the
point where you're meeting his family

01:13:47.755 --> 01:13:50.451
and I should be careful
how I'm talking to you?

01:13:52.427 --> 01:13:54.520
Are you sleeping with him?

01:13:59.767 --> 01:14:01.962
I wouldn't say it that way.

01:14:04.072 --> 01:14:06.370
Well, what way
would you say it?

01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:13.513
Are you going to stop
seeing him?

01:14:16.618 --> 01:14:18.711
That pause says it all.
No, it doesn't.

01:14:18.786 --> 01:14:20.481
That's not true.
That's not true.

01:14:20.555 --> 01:14:22.921
Who are you?
I can't even look at you.

01:14:28.796 --> 01:14:30.058
Oh, God.

01:14:30.632 --> 01:14:31.894
Oh, God.

01:14:33.468 --> 01:14:36.232
The train has been delayed.

01:14:44.712 --> 01:14:48.113
The train has been delayed. Scusi,
I'm gonna go check on the soufflés.

01:14:59.561 --> 01:15:00.926
Oh, no.

01:15:03.164 --> 01:15:04.495
Oh, no.

01:15:05.366 --> 01:15:09.427
Jason's finally met such a wonderful girl.

01:15:09.504 --> 01:15:14.271
She's so sweet. She has the
loveliest spirit about her.

01:15:14.342 --> 01:15:18.836
But I still can't believe
he found her on the Internet.

01:15:18.913 --> 01:15:20.847
Not like in our day.

01:15:20.915 --> 01:15:22.280
That somehow reminds me

01:15:22.350 --> 01:15:25.808
of people writing a phone
number on the bathroom wall.

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:35.688
Sweetie, I think that we should...
Are you dating somebody else?

01:15:35.763 --> 01:15:36.752
What?

01:15:37.498 --> 01:15:39.329
I just heard your mom
on the phone talk about

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:41.664
how you're dating some girl
you met on the Internet.

01:15:41.736 --> 01:15:44.102
Oh, it's nothing
like that at all.

01:15:44.172 --> 01:15:47.801
I'm surprised and I don't even
know if I have the right to be,

01:15:47.875 --> 01:15:49.604
'cause to be honest,
I feel like I need to tell you

01:15:49.677 --> 01:15:52.805
that I'm also dating
somebody else.

01:15:55.383 --> 01:15:59.683
Well, first of all, to be honest,
you didn't need to be so honest.

01:16:00.288 --> 01:16:02.586
I'm not seeing anyone but you.

01:16:03.258 --> 01:16:07.661
But since we're being honest, this is
something that I was saving for later.

01:16:13.001 --> 01:16:14.127
What?

01:16:16.638 --> 01:16:18.401
My mother's personal ad?

01:16:22.810 --> 01:16:25.711
Oh, my God.

01:16:26.214 --> 01:16:28.239
You sounded just like her
there.

01:16:28.316 --> 01:16:29.874
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:16:29.951 --> 01:16:32.146
Hey, hey, hey. What does it matter how we met?

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:34.279
You and my mom have been
totally scheming

01:16:34.355 --> 01:16:36.550
and now I know exactly
why she pushed me on you.

01:16:36.624 --> 01:16:38.922
Because she was voting
for you. She found you.

01:16:38.993 --> 01:16:41.018
Yeah, and it doesn't
take anything away from us.

01:16:41.095 --> 01:16:44.724
What matters is that we did meet
and how good this is between us.

01:16:44.799 --> 01:16:45.857
And the truth of that...

01:16:45.933 --> 01:16:48.265
The truth? Where's the truth?
Where's the truth?

01:16:48.336 --> 01:16:50.998
Because you've been living a lie
and I've been lying to you, Jason.

01:16:51.072 --> 01:16:52.437
And it doesn't
change anything.

01:16:52.507 --> 01:16:54.304
How does that not
change everything?

01:16:54.375 --> 01:16:58.709
Because you're here. I think
you already made your choice.

01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:00.611
But if it helps, I'll say it.

01:17:00.682 --> 01:17:03.913
Stop seeing him.
Then you and I can get closer.

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:08.187
Close enough to spend the
rest of our lives together.

01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:10.487
I knew I had you
the day I met you.

01:17:10.558 --> 01:17:12.150
How could you know
something like that?

01:17:12.226 --> 01:17:13.488
'Cause you were so nervous,

01:17:13.561 --> 01:17:17.053
you laughed like a hyena in that
beautiful polka dot dress of yours.

01:17:17.131 --> 01:17:18.291
Really?

01:17:18.366 --> 01:17:19.355
Mmm-hmm.

01:17:25.306 --> 01:17:27.103
I'll tell you one thing,
though.

01:17:27.175 --> 01:17:29.200
You did not have me
the moment that we met

01:17:29.277 --> 01:17:30.869
because I wasn't even sure
that I liked the fact

01:17:30.945 --> 01:17:34.278
that your staff talked about you
behind your back at the dessert table.

01:17:34.349 --> 01:17:36.180
And, excuse me,
but, truth be told,

01:17:36.250 --> 01:17:37.808
I didn't like anything
that you ordered for me

01:17:37.885 --> 01:17:39.648
on our first date,
except the calamari.

01:17:39.721 --> 01:17:42.656
And okay, fine, yes, it was nice
to not have to think for a change,

01:17:42.724 --> 01:17:45.522
but who wants someone
who doesn't think?

01:17:45.593 --> 01:17:50.053
Look, and sometimes you laugh when I cry
and say, "Huh?" when I make perfect sense.

01:17:50.131 --> 01:17:54.761
And never, ever, in my life have I
burned a chocolate soufflé until now

01:17:54.836 --> 01:17:56.269
and that, in and of itself,

01:17:56.337 --> 01:17:59.864
oh, my God, should have told me I
don't feel like myself around you.

01:17:59.941 --> 01:18:03.399
And I would have decided that a long
time ago if it weren't for my mother.

01:18:03.478 --> 01:18:06.413
Because who wants someone
who laughs like a hyena

01:18:06.481 --> 01:18:10.508
in a polka dot dress
that my mother made me buy?

01:18:13.221 --> 01:18:14.882
I love that dress.

01:18:16.924 --> 01:18:18.414
Take her out.

01:18:32.373 --> 01:18:33.465
Hey.

01:18:36.644 --> 01:18:38.908
Stuart, this is an emergency.
Well, should I wait?

01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:40.777
Let's reschedule.
But I'm suicidal.

01:18:40.848 --> 01:18:43.783
Oh, wow, this is making me feel like
when I was the last pick in kickball...

01:18:43.851 --> 01:18:46.786
Right and that's exactly
where we'll begin next week.

01:18:46.854 --> 01:18:51.086
Maggie, you promised me
after Willie Matthews,

01:18:51.159 --> 01:18:52.626
you would never
lie to me again.

01:18:52.693 --> 01:18:55.253
Oh, Milly Woo, Milly Boo.
Stop.

01:18:55.329 --> 01:18:57.729
Well, I'm sorry. Mommy made
me promise not to say anything

01:18:57.799 --> 01:18:59.528
or she'd be furious.
Mommy?

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:03.559
Mommy made you promise?
Where is your own moral code?

01:19:03.638 --> 01:19:06.163
Your adulthood?
Your sisterhood?

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:07.468
Just...

01:19:10.912 --> 01:19:12.880
I'm feeling rejected by you.
Okay.

01:19:12.947 --> 01:19:14.710
And it's bringing up memories
of summer camp

01:19:14.782 --> 01:19:18.218
when Jimmy Feldon and Eric Fishman
both transferred out of my bunk.

01:19:18.286 --> 01:19:20.049
I totally understand, Stuart.

01:19:20.121 --> 01:19:23.318
Come back today and we'll do a
two-hour session at 3:00 p. m.

01:19:24.926 --> 01:19:26.018
Listen, you're right.

01:19:26.093 --> 01:19:28.891
I didn't handle this well and
I understand you feel betrayed.

01:19:28.963 --> 01:19:31.557
But, really, isn't some of
this anger a little misplaced?

01:19:31.632 --> 01:19:34.260
No, no, Maggie. It's placed
exactly where it should be.

01:19:34.335 --> 01:19:37.099
And there is plenty to go around, so
don't worry, Mom will be getting hers.

01:19:37.171 --> 01:19:38.763
Okay...
Maggie.

01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:42.666
Stuart, I am asking you
to empower yourself and leave.

01:19:42.743 --> 01:19:44.870
This could be a huge day
for you, Stuart.

01:19:44.946 --> 01:19:48.507
This makes me feel like when I was
13 and no one came to my bar mitzvah.

01:19:48.583 --> 01:19:50.346
Why didn't they come?
I don't get it.

01:19:50.418 --> 01:19:52.249
Stuart, you have
a blood sugar problem, okay?

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.981
Just get some lunch,
you'll be fine.

01:19:54.055 --> 01:19:56.319
Honey, I know this is painful.

01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:58.051
Do you have any snacks
in here?

01:19:58.125 --> 01:19:59.524
Third shelf on the right.

01:19:59.594 --> 01:20:01.084
Honey, instead of blaming Mom,

01:20:01.162 --> 01:20:04.325
you should really focus on the fact that
both of these guys went along with it.

01:20:04.398 --> 01:20:07.424
I am, I am. Because
I just told Jason that...

01:20:08.369 --> 01:20:09.700
Guys...

01:20:11.906 --> 01:20:13.134
Guys?

01:20:17.178 --> 01:20:18.805
That was plural, wasn't it?

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.848
I feel like I don't know what
you guys are talking about

01:20:20.915 --> 01:20:23.008
and it's making me feel
very much out of the loop,

01:20:23.084 --> 01:20:24.813
and it's making me want
to jump out the window.

01:20:24.886 --> 01:20:27.719
Stuart. For ten years,
my sister has sat here

01:20:27.788 --> 01:20:30.518
and told me that you're
about to commit suicide.

01:20:30.591 --> 01:20:31.751
Well?

01:20:34.328 --> 01:20:36.888
You mean she's been
talking about me?

01:20:38.733 --> 01:20:41.668
Wow. God.

01:20:43.471 --> 01:20:46.440
Mom? Are you there?
Pick up the phone, Mom.

01:20:47.441 --> 01:20:48.703
Hello?

01:20:51.279 --> 01:20:53.270
You've reached Daphne...
You've reached Daphne...

01:20:53.347 --> 01:20:54.473
You've reached Daphne Wilder.

01:20:54.549 --> 01:20:57.245
Please leave a message
after the tone.

01:20:59.954 --> 01:21:02.616
Oh, my God.
Oh, thank you, dear God.

01:21:09.130 --> 01:21:10.256
Mom.

01:21:17.471 --> 01:21:18.529
Mom.

01:21:18.606 --> 01:21:19.937
Yeah.

01:21:24.378 --> 01:21:25.538
Yeah?

01:21:28.783 --> 01:21:29.772
Yes!

01:21:30.151 --> 01:21:32.051
Oh, my God.
Yes, oh, yes!

01:21:33.421 --> 01:21:35.252
Oh, my God!

01:21:36.657 --> 01:21:38.386
Yes. Yes.

01:21:38.459 --> 01:21:40.256
Yes!

01:21:42.163 --> 01:21:43.960
Okay, so the orange-cranberry
muffins are in here?

01:21:44.031 --> 01:21:45.055
They're in there.

01:21:45.132 --> 01:21:46.895
And the ones with the nuts
are in here too?

01:21:46.968 --> 01:21:48.629
They're in there, too.

01:21:48.703 --> 01:21:50.000
I had a little trouble
with the frosting,

01:21:50.071 --> 01:21:51.561
but I know how much
you love butter cream.

01:21:51.639 --> 01:21:54.699
Mother, I told you
on the phone I need distance.

01:21:55.176 --> 01:21:57.406
Okay. But it's a new recipe.

01:21:57.478 --> 01:22:00.675
Tangerine instead of orange.
For a clean slate?

01:22:00.748 --> 01:22:03.273
Why don't you get it?
I don't want to see you.

01:22:03.351 --> 01:22:07.981
Milly, if I'm guilty of any crime, it's
just that I've just loved you too much.

01:22:08.055 --> 01:22:09.147
Here.

01:22:10.491 --> 01:22:13.324
Milly?
It was just so you. I...

01:22:20.801 --> 01:22:21.961
Milly?

01:22:51.732 --> 01:22:54.667
This isn't the way
it was supposed to be.

01:22:55.136 --> 01:22:57.366
Welcome to life.

01:22:57.438 --> 01:23:02.375
Yeah, but I mean, how can I be
happy if she's not happy, hmm?

01:23:09.316 --> 01:23:11.876
Hey, it's Milly.
Leave me a message.

01:23:12.653 --> 01:23:16.316
Milly? It's your mother,
Daphne Wilder.

01:23:17.058 --> 01:23:18.650
Please pick up.

01:23:19.827 --> 01:23:21.624
It's been four days.

01:23:24.598 --> 01:23:25.724
Okay.

01:23:31.038 --> 01:23:33.063
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:34.630
What are... Nothing.

01:23:35.476 --> 01:23:37.103
Just do nothing.

01:23:46.387 --> 01:23:48.947
Hey, it's Milly.
Leave me a message.

01:23:49.023 --> 01:23:50.923
Hi, Milly.
This is your mother.

01:23:50.991 --> 01:23:54.825
Hopefully, you still have
a mental picture of me.

01:23:54.895 --> 01:23:58.023
We have the same hands
and earlobes

01:23:58.132 --> 01:24:01.124
and love of Bauer pottery.

01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:04.729
I know that you asked me
not to call you

01:24:05.439 --> 01:24:06.428
and I respect that.

01:24:06.507 --> 01:24:09.340
I just thought that
you might like to know

01:24:09.410 --> 01:24:13.107
that I found Grandma's recipe for
your favorite Lady Baltimore cake.

01:24:13.547 --> 01:24:15.412
The one from my
third birthday.

01:24:15.483 --> 01:24:17.781
The one from
your third birthday.

01:24:17.918 --> 01:24:19.977
You know what, Milly? Okay,
you were right about Johnny.

01:24:20.054 --> 01:24:21.851
Obviously,
he has more character.

01:24:21.922 --> 01:24:24.254
I mean,
he's really a good guy.

01:24:24.492 --> 01:24:29.122
And you should know
that he never saw that ad,

01:24:29.196 --> 01:24:31.323
and, in fact,
we met by chance.

01:24:31.432 --> 01:24:34.526
He was just an
innocent bystander.

01:24:38.272 --> 01:24:41.833
I know that I'm saying too
much. I've learned my lesson.

01:24:42.009 --> 01:24:43.033
Good.

01:24:43.244 --> 01:24:47.180
Because, Milly,
it's your life.

01:24:47.782 --> 01:24:51.912
Yup, that's right.
That's absolutely right.

01:24:54.188 --> 01:24:56.713
Hey, it's Milly.
Leave me a message.

01:24:56.791 --> 01:25:01.785
I know you're in there and it's fine with
me that you've chosen not to pick up.

01:25:03.164 --> 01:25:07.362
But, Milly, if you're in any
way still pulled to Johnny,

01:25:07.434 --> 01:25:11.200
then please don't let
your pride or our differences

01:25:11.272 --> 01:25:13.331
come between you
and getting what you want

01:25:13.407 --> 01:25:17.901
otherwise, honey, you're gonna
end up like some pathetic character

01:25:17.978 --> 01:25:20.173
in a Tennessee Williams play.

01:25:21.282 --> 01:25:24.149
Believe me,
I know what I'm talking about.

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:27.646
Okay.

01:25:49.276 --> 01:25:50.504
Milly...

01:25:51.345 --> 01:25:52.505
Milly?

01:25:54.782 --> 01:25:57.307
I never meant to
hurt you, sweetie.

01:25:58.385 --> 01:26:04.153
And I promise I will never
ever interfere ever again.

01:26:08.929 --> 01:26:11.193
I was, I was only, I mean...

01:26:15.236 --> 01:26:18.034
I guess
what I'm trying to say is

01:26:22.343 --> 01:26:26.006
that I was just trying to
protect you from becoming me.

01:26:27.848 --> 01:26:29.372
My sweet girl.

01:26:34.255 --> 01:26:35.381
Mom?

01:26:39.126 --> 01:26:40.457
Hi, honey.

01:26:44.965 --> 01:26:46.364
I miss you.

01:26:48.068 --> 01:26:49.729
I miss you, too.

01:26:59.313 --> 01:27:01.110
Solo on the four chord.

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:08.554
Alternate the bass line,
will you?

01:27:13.861 --> 01:27:16.091
Too late for spring sign-up.

01:27:16.163 --> 01:27:17.653
I've actually been here
before.

01:27:17.731 --> 01:27:21.861
I came once on a Tuesday when it
was closed, and I just wanted to...

01:27:21.936 --> 01:27:24.496
You know, I can't hear you.
I'm sorry.

01:27:25.572 --> 01:27:26.800
Please.

01:27:33.714 --> 01:27:35.113
I miss you.

01:27:37.217 --> 01:27:38.616
I miss us

01:27:40.421 --> 01:27:41.581
and I'm not seeing anybody.

01:27:41.655 --> 01:27:42.883
That doesn't change
anything for us, Milly.

01:27:42.957 --> 01:27:46.358
Yeah, but Johnny, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm so deeply sorry,

01:27:46.427 --> 01:27:49.954
and I wish I could find a less
cliché word for sorry, but...

01:27:52.967 --> 01:27:56.403
It was an aberration.
It's not who I am,

01:27:56.470 --> 01:28:00.065
and I know we can't start
over, but maybe we could...

01:28:02.242 --> 01:28:04.676
Maybe we could try this again.

01:28:08.315 --> 01:28:10.476
I need to get back up there.

01:28:25.699 --> 01:28:29.635
Okay, you're driving a bus.
Seven hundred and fifty people get on.

01:28:29.703 --> 01:28:31.102
Two get off.

01:28:31.505 --> 01:28:33.439
Thirty thousand
seventy-one get on.

01:28:33.507 --> 01:28:35.168
Four hundred and five
get off.

01:28:35.242 --> 01:28:37.710
A thousand get on and nine
hundred and ninety-nine get off.

01:28:37.778 --> 01:28:39.302
Get off.

01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:41.905
What color are
the bus driver's eyes?

01:28:42.249 --> 01:28:43.375
I don't know.

01:28:43.450 --> 01:28:46.442
I said you're driving the bus.
Get it, dummy?

01:28:47.221 --> 01:28:48.620
You dummy.

01:28:49.023 --> 01:28:50.047
Dummy.

01:28:50.124 --> 01:28:53.321
You did say that, Lionel.
That's right. That's so good.

01:28:53.394 --> 01:28:55.988
He did. That is so great. That is so great.

01:28:56.063 --> 01:28:57.087
Want to hear it again?

01:28:57.164 --> 01:28:58.392
Well, I mean, I don't know.

01:28:58.465 --> 01:29:01.298
Actually, I thought you really
nailed it that last time, so...

01:29:01.368 --> 01:29:03.893
Didn't he?
Just one more time. Please?

01:29:03.971 --> 01:29:04.960
Okay.

01:29:05.039 --> 01:29:06.404
Okay, you're driving a bus.

01:29:06.473 --> 01:29:09.033
Five people get off. Six
people get on. Really?

01:29:09.109 --> 01:29:11.839
Seven hundred and
seventy-five thousand get on.

01:29:11.912 --> 01:29:13.607
Seven hundred and
thirty-five million and one...

01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:15.147
Oh, no.
Hey, guys.

01:29:17.117 --> 01:29:18.948
You know, I forgot
a few things at the market.

01:29:19.019 --> 01:29:20.111
I'm just gonna...
I'll be right back.

01:29:20.187 --> 01:29:21.711
Dad, Dad, you got to
hear this punch line.

01:29:21.789 --> 01:29:24.223
Yeah, yeah. You really, really...
You have to stick around for this.

01:29:24.291 --> 01:29:26.350
Think you got to, Johnny.

01:29:27.227 --> 01:29:28.854
- Okay, now.
- What is it?

01:29:28.929 --> 01:29:30.624
You are driving a bus.
Yeah.

01:29:30.697 --> 01:29:33.063
A billon million catrillion
get on.

01:29:33.133 --> 01:29:34.896
I cannot believe you are
here. You are truly insane.

01:29:34.968 --> 01:29:36.526
Two hundred billion million
get off.

01:29:36.603 --> 01:29:37.900
Well, I... This is
a surprise to you?

01:29:37.971 --> 01:29:39.233
Daphne, you're not listening.

01:29:39.306 --> 01:29:42.469
Honey, oh, no, no. I swear,
of course, I'm listening.

01:29:42.543 --> 01:29:46.035
Okay. Dad and Daphne.
You're driving a bus.

01:29:46.113 --> 01:29:50.049
Five hundred catrillion
cazillion get on.

01:29:50.117 --> 01:29:52.381
But zero...
Lionel, look.

01:29:52.453 --> 01:29:53.920
A blimp.
Where?

01:29:53.987 --> 01:29:55.614
Right there.
I can't see it.

01:29:55.689 --> 01:29:57.714
Right there. Look harder.
Where? Show me.

01:29:57.791 --> 01:30:00.225
I can't see it.
Up, up. Look harder.

01:30:03.464 --> 01:30:07.457
I've wanted to talk to you for the past
few days and I haven't had the nerve.

01:30:07.534 --> 01:30:09.695
That I find hard to believe.

01:30:10.204 --> 01:30:12.399
Johnny, you have
too much pride.

01:30:12.473 --> 01:30:13.963
I prefer to call it
common sense.

01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:17.374
It's pride, and it's a
quality you and I share.

01:30:17.444 --> 01:30:20.538
It's an admirable one,
until it becomes a wall.

01:30:20.881 --> 01:30:23.213
"Well, yes, I am alone,

01:30:23.283 --> 01:30:26.411
"but at least I have my righteous
anger to keep me company at night. "

01:30:26.487 --> 01:30:28.478
Come on, that's not a life,
and you know it.

01:30:28.555 --> 01:30:31.046
And let's face it.
I mean, if it wasn't for me,

01:30:31.125 --> 01:30:34.356
obviously Milly never would have
betrayed you in the first place.

01:30:34.428 --> 01:30:36.259
So what are you doing, Johnny?
What are you doing?

01:30:36.330 --> 01:30:39.060
Why waste one more minute
of your life?

01:30:40.367 --> 01:30:41.959
And I'm right.

01:30:42.035 --> 01:30:44.333
I'm so right.

01:30:45.038 --> 01:30:46.505
Damn it.

01:30:46.573 --> 01:30:48.268
For once, she is.

01:30:51.612 --> 01:30:53.876
Jeez, you guys,
no one's listening.

01:30:53.947 --> 01:30:56.609
If Milly was here,
she would get my joke.

01:30:56.683 --> 01:31:00.483
You're driving a bus. Ten people
get on. Ten people get off.

01:31:00.554 --> 01:31:03.887
Thirty thousand get on. Thirty
thousand get off. A million get on...

01:31:04.558 --> 01:31:06.321
See, that's the fun
of the tuna pasta toss,

01:31:06.393 --> 01:31:08.554
'cause it's delicious
and it's easy,

01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:10.221
because when
you're cooking for one,

01:31:10.297 --> 01:31:12.891
it's really important to look
forward to the end result. You know?

01:31:12.966 --> 01:31:15.526
What if you want to
make it for two?

01:31:21.041 --> 01:31:26.274
It's a little bit more complicated,
but I think it can be done.

01:31:32.219 --> 01:31:33.777
I see some of you
have gone ahead

01:31:33.854 --> 01:31:37.187
and already added your carrots
and your pickled relish.

01:31:37.257 --> 01:31:39.316
And remember
that some people like dill.

01:31:39.393 --> 01:31:42.760
Even before I met you,
I had an instinct about you.

01:31:43.197 --> 01:31:46.894
And once I saw you were a woman
with profound static cling,

01:31:46.967 --> 01:31:49.561
I wanted to be
that force around you.

01:31:50.537 --> 01:31:53.734
Personally, I love dill.
I think it's not used enough

01:31:53.807 --> 01:31:56.105
and very underrated,
sort of, like, mayonnaise,

01:31:56.176 --> 01:31:59.441
and I also really love
olive oil for tuna.

01:31:59.513 --> 01:32:03.108
I love that when I breathe you
in, you smell of cake batter.

01:32:05.953 --> 01:32:08.285
And I love that
you have this insane way

01:32:08.355 --> 01:32:11.620
of talking in circles
that makes perfect sense.

01:32:12.893 --> 01:32:13.951
I do?

01:32:15.128 --> 01:32:18.291
'Cause sometimes I feel like
nobody understands me but...

01:32:18.365 --> 01:32:19.423
Me.

01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:21.531
I get you.

01:32:24.471 --> 01:32:29.135
That's wonderful. But, you
know, my bladder is about to pop.

01:32:29.209 --> 01:32:31.439
Can you hold it for a minute?

01:32:35.482 --> 01:32:38.178
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, guys.
Where were we?

01:32:39.319 --> 01:32:42.311
With the tuna pasta
and the tuna noodle doodles,

01:32:42.389 --> 01:32:43.651
tuna sandwiches, tuna...

01:32:43.724 --> 01:32:46.022
I love your eyes.

01:32:47.794 --> 01:32:49.625
I even love

01:32:51.865 --> 01:32:53.332
your mother.

01:33:32.472 --> 01:33:34.940
- Well, we gotta get this show on the road.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:33:35.008 --> 01:33:37.067
Where is she? Well, it should
have started 20 minutes ago.

01:33:37.144 --> 01:33:39.203
That's not like her. I mean,
the ceremony has to start soon.

01:33:39.279 --> 01:33:40.644
I don't know
where she is, though.

01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:44.539
Oh, my God.

01:33:44.618 --> 01:33:46.609
I'm worried.
I hope she's okay.

01:33:46.687 --> 01:33:48.484
Just call her.
All right. I'm calling.

01:33:48.555 --> 01:33:50.455
It's her own wedding.

01:33:51.792 --> 01:33:53.692
Oh, no.

01:33:54.328 --> 01:33:55.352
No.

01:33:57.297 --> 01:33:58.628
Hi, honey.

01:33:58.865 --> 01:34:01.356
Hi, Mom. Where are you?

01:34:02.602 --> 01:34:05.799
Honey, I just have to talk to you
a little bit later, okay? Mil...

01:34:05.872 --> 01:34:09.672
Oh, my God. I kind of think she's
having sex with Joe right now.

01:34:09.743 --> 01:34:10.869
Great.
Awesome.

01:34:10.944 --> 01:34:13.845
Would she like us to explain that to
all the guests, or just the preacher?

01:34:13.914 --> 01:34:15.404
She is a woman after
my own heart.

01:34:15.482 --> 01:34:18.212
All right, Mom? We are gonna
give you five more minutes.

01:34:18.285 --> 01:34:19.809
Ten. Ten.

01:34:19.886 --> 01:34:21.217
Mom. Come on.

01:34:21.288 --> 01:34:23.313
Open up the champagne,
sweetie. What's the rush?

01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:25.324
Because I said so.

01:34:25.392 --> 01:34:27.121
Mom, don't hang up
the phone on me.

01:34:30.197 --> 01:34:32.222
You got soul

01:34:32.299 --> 01:34:34.460
Everybody knows

01:34:34.534 --> 01:34:38.527
That it's all right,
it's all right

01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:43.976
When you wake up
early in the morning

01:34:44.044 --> 01:34:47.707
Feeling sad,
like so many of us do

01:34:48.715 --> 01:34:53.152
Hum a little soul
Make life your goal

01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:58.487
Surely something's got to come
to you And say it's all right

01:34:58.558 --> 01:35:00.048
It's all right

01:35:00.694 --> 01:35:05.028
It's all right
It's all right

01:35:05.098 --> 01:35:07.157
It's all right

01:35:07.234 --> 01:35:08.963
Have a good time

01:35:09.035 --> 01:35:13.028
'Cause it's all right
It's all right

01:35:14.708 --> 01:35:17.506
- Are we married or what?
- All right.

01:35:18.500 --> 01:36:00.700
