00:01.944 --> 00:04.437
- Who's it from?
- They're coming back.

00:04.540 --> 00:06.962
I mean, he nearly bankrupted us and
what was left went to me,

00:07.009 --> 00:09.329
and now, what, two years later
he's in a Ãã1 million house.

00:09.376 --> 00:12.072
- I mean, what's going on?
- It's not your problem.

00:12.197 --> 00:14.804
I've seen some of our friends
while I've been sorting this place out

00:14.851 --> 00:16.587
and they say that nothing's changed.

00:16.635 --> 00:19.205
Your same life but without me.

00:19.429 --> 00:21.429
Out of the whole world,
you chose to come back

00:21.501 --> 00:23.431
and live less than a
mile from my front door.

00:23.556 --> 00:25.415
You can always find
somewhere else yourself.

00:27.158 --> 00:28.619
So what's the plan?

00:28.845 --> 00:30.275
Wait and see.

00:30.435 --> 00:31.852
There's only one way
I'm leaving now

00:31.900 --> 00:32.981
and that's in a coffin.

00:33.202 --> 00:34.461
That's good to know.

00:35.524 --> 00:36.939
- Are we going?
- Going where?

00:37.016 --> 00:38.391
- Dad's.
- What? To stay?

00:38.415 --> 00:39.813
He's not going anywhere.

00:40.056 --> 00:41.315
You stay here!

00:45.525 --> 00:47.214
Tom!

00:51.963 --> 00:53.932
Hi, it's Tom. Leave a message.

00:55.241 --> 00:57.634
Tom, please call me back.

00:57.727 --> 00:59.657
I don't understand why you left.

01:01.515 --> 01:02.534
Love you.

02:02.125 --> 02:03.524
Hi!

02:04.634 --> 02:05.673
Hi.

02:07.137 --> 02:08.567
Dropping Tom off?

02:09.606 --> 02:11.098
- No.
- Oh, er, so you...

02:11.182 --> 02:12.654
He's staying with his dad
at the moment.

02:12.701 --> 02:14.762
- That makes sense. It's a nice house.
- No...

02:14.823 --> 02:16.340
Video room, swimming pool,

02:16.455 --> 02:19.594
huge garden. I'm not saying
he's shallow, I'm saying he's 15.

02:22.528 --> 02:24.648
If you're not dropping him
off, then why are you here?

02:24.722 --> 02:26.181
To see him.

02:27.675 --> 02:29.044
But he's about to go in.

02:29.388 --> 02:30.837
And I've seen him.

02:34.739 --> 02:36.598
Do you want to meet
for breakfast tomorrow?

02:36.646 --> 02:38.442
I've got a free period first thing.

02:39.509 --> 02:40.788
We could talk.

02:42.856 --> 02:43.980
Sure.

02:44.028 --> 02:45.778
Great.
I'll text you, make a plan.

04:09.725 --> 04:11.400
- There you are.
- Thank you.

04:11.936 --> 04:13.155
Thanks.

04:26.212 --> 04:27.728
How's your day so far?

04:29.001 --> 04:30.697
Productive.

04:30.921 --> 04:32.370
You know what to do?

04:32.769 --> 04:34.268
Yep.

05:17.422 --> 05:19.369
- Hello, mate.
- How are you?

05:19.888 --> 05:22.462
Oh! Hi!

05:22.587 --> 05:25.462
Erm... er... I'm good!

05:25.548 --> 05:28.587
- I'm here about the... the office space.
- I run it.

05:29.017 --> 05:31.134
- What?
- The Courtyard.

05:31.373 --> 05:35.592
Oh, right!
Right. Oh, well, then, erm...

05:36.275 --> 05:37.451
This is awkward.

05:37.517 --> 05:39.658
No. Come on,
it was a long time ago.

05:39.869 --> 05:41.281
Do you want to look around?

05:41.415 --> 05:42.751
Lisa!

05:43.048 --> 05:44.572
Neil Baker, friend of mine.

05:44.654 --> 05:46.556
- Hi. Can you give him the tour?
- Sure.

05:46.604 --> 05:47.759
Hope you enjoy it.

05:47.830 --> 05:50.947
Hey, wait!
We should catch up properly.

05:51.162 --> 05:53.564
We should. I don't know that
I still have your number.

05:53.641 --> 05:57.259
Oh, hold on, I think I've got
yours, erm... Well, I'll text you.

05:57.341 --> 05:59.603
I mean, unless you're around tonight?

05:59.970 --> 06:01.275
For a drink?

06:02.088 --> 06:03.447
Yeah. Why not?

06:05.205 --> 06:06.614
Great.

06:20.373 --> 06:22.611
- Max!
- Oh, hi.

06:22.957 --> 06:24.205
Is Tom coming out?

06:24.306 --> 06:27.361
He said I should just
go and he'd see me later.

06:27.853 --> 06:29.331
He moved in with his dad.

06:29.673 --> 06:30.986
I don't know if he told you.

06:31.149 --> 06:32.149
Yeah.

06:32.205 --> 06:35.025
Has he said anything? About why he went?

06:35.260 --> 06:37.549
We don't really talk about that stuff.

06:38.921 --> 06:40.283
OK.

06:41.072 --> 06:43.001
But you said you're
going to see him later?

06:43.298 --> 06:45.845
Yeah, he said he had
a thing to do first.

06:47.249 --> 06:49.056
What thing?

06:49.367 --> 06:50.908
Maybe you should talk to him.

06:52.113 --> 06:53.562
OK.

06:54.702 --> 06:56.634
Don't tell him I spoke to you.

06:57.619 --> 06:59.173
Why not?

07:00.910 --> 07:02.767
He told me to leave him alone.

08:17.763 --> 08:20.376
Hey! It's your day off.

08:20.611 --> 08:21.790
You couldn't stay away, uh?

08:21.864 --> 08:23.181
Er, no. I...

08:23.229 --> 08:24.778
I am so sorry
about Simon's party.

08:24.826 --> 08:26.747
It was just that so many
of my friends were going,

08:26.794 --> 08:28.535
and it meant that Connor could
meet them before the wedding.

08:28.583 --> 08:31.283
- Where's Tom?
- Er, what?

08:31.331 --> 08:33.251
He just came in here.
Did he want to see me?

08:33.745 --> 08:35.525
I don't know.

08:35.573 --> 08:37.539
Julie, was Tom here?

08:37.682 --> 08:40.486
Erm, well, yes, he's got an appointment.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.650
- Not with me.
- Sian. He's in with Sian.

08:42.767 --> 08:44.901
- Sian's not his doctor.
- Why? Why's he in there?

08:45.017 --> 08:48.651
I don't know. And, well,
it's confidential, isn't it?

08:56.486 --> 08:59.761
- All right?
- Yeah. Thanks.

09:13.925 --> 09:15.158
Hello?

09:15.923 --> 09:17.069
Hi.

09:17.424 --> 09:18.746
What's the problem?

09:18.794 --> 09:21.065
No problem, I was... I was just
going to make myself a cup of tea,

09:21.112 --> 09:22.941
and I thought you might want to join me.

09:23.822 --> 09:24.970
Oh!

09:25.059 --> 09:26.728
It's more or less arranged,

09:26.822 --> 09:29.134
I mean, it's happening
in the next few days so...

09:29.217 --> 09:31.346
But I understand that that's
exactly why you need to

09:31.393 --> 09:34.845
plan your contingencies.
I mean, what if someone gets ill?

09:34.955 --> 09:37.644
Or what happens if you haven't
booked the venue properly?

09:37.692 --> 09:39.580
Or if something gets
on your dress? You know,

09:39.702 --> 09:42.191
I went to a wedding once
where there weren't any plates.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.924
They forgot the plates!

09:44.080 --> 09:45.876
Well, I'm sure it'll be all right.

09:45.939 --> 09:47.570
And the weather! You can't predict that!

09:47.634 --> 09:50.447
They say you can but you
can't. Weddington boots.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.784
- I'm sorry?
- Weddington boots. Wellies for a wedding.

09:52.832 --> 09:54.963
You really should have some of
those. You should go online...

09:55.011 --> 09:58.751
- I think we should be OK.
- We're indoors mostly.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.561
But you can't be too careful.

10:00.790 --> 10:03.611
My friend Esther, she
got married on a beach,

10:03.830 --> 10:05.306
and there was a hurricane.

10:06.199 --> 10:07.852
Actually,
you put the kettle on.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.228
I'll be with you in a minute.

10:09.291 --> 10:12.900
Oh.
OK. Sure.

10:15.712 --> 10:17.228
Sian! Hi!

10:17.442 --> 10:18.661
Hi!

10:21.212 --> 10:24.501
- Had a good morning?
- Yes. I didn't think you were in today.

10:24.642 --> 10:29.376
Well, I'm not, officially.
Actually, I wanted to catch you.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.783
I wondered...

10:32.689 --> 10:34.519
Do you want to come
round for dinner tonight?

10:34.566 --> 10:38.455
- Dinner? At yours? With...?
- With me.

10:38.622 --> 10:40.423
Erm, just you?

10:40.508 --> 10:42.580
Just me, yes.

10:43.228 --> 10:46.024
There's been a bit of tension
between us and I thought maybe

10:46.072 --> 10:48.603
we should get to know each
other in a less formal setting.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.773
What do you think? Are you free?

10:52.213 --> 10:54.447
Why don't you
come to mine instead?

10:54.524 --> 10:56.165
I've got a monkfish
and some asparagus.

10:56.213 --> 10:58.642
I was going to do it anyway.
Enough for two.

11:00.617 --> 11:02.790
Sure. Right.

11:03.014 --> 11:05.634
- Oh, bring wine.
- I'll bring lots.

11:06.564 --> 11:09.203
They said you weren't here
today, but it's urgent.

11:09.267 --> 11:11.142
I can't lift up my arms.

11:13.160 --> 11:14.845
Erm, Sian?

11:15.764 --> 11:17.705
Could you do me a favour?

11:52.142 --> 11:55.094
- Hi. Sorry I'm late but I got held up.
- Yeah, so let's go.

11:55.142 --> 11:57.040
You said early evenings
was better, I believe?

11:57.111 --> 11:59.728
- I don't understand.
- Shall we start inside?

12:00.009 --> 12:03.108
- Are you the taxi?
- Estate agent. Your husband called,

12:03.164 --> 12:04.814
asking for a valuation.

12:04.961 --> 12:06.447
I don't have a husband.

12:06.647 --> 12:08.392
I'm sure this is the right address.

12:08.566 --> 12:10.165
Is it Doctor Foster?

12:10.213 --> 12:12.344
The man who called you,
you still have his number?

12:12.392 --> 12:14.641
- I expect so.
- Call him back, say if he does this again,

12:14.689 --> 12:16.680
his ex-wife will contact the police.

12:21.222 --> 12:23.331
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

12:26.694 --> 12:28.103
And you.

12:29.439 --> 12:31.703
So, you don't want a valuation?

12:58.244 --> 12:59.978
- Oh.
- What?

13:00.205 --> 13:02.743
- You are expecting me?
- Well, yes, but not at this time.

13:02.814 --> 13:04.477
- You're early.
- By five minutes?

13:04.548 --> 13:05.861
Exactly. I was...

13:07.205 --> 13:09.681
It's fine. I'll manage.

13:11.689 --> 13:14.323
- Well, come on in, then.
- Thank you.

13:21.486 --> 13:23.400
- Hey!
- Sorry. Long day.

13:23.471 --> 13:24.908
It's all right.

13:25.041 --> 13:28.228
- So, er, what'll it be?
- Red Ribbon.

13:28.434 --> 13:30.496
A Red Ribbon, please.

13:30.994 --> 13:32.877
How are you coping with the pub?

13:33.002 --> 13:36.799
Yeah. Well, I'm not entirely
comfortable, as you can imagine.

13:36.963 --> 13:39.478
- I can.
- It's just so dirty.

13:39.869 --> 13:41.463
Because of all the poor people.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.806
It's good to know you haven't changed.

13:45.622 --> 13:47.921
This could be so weird. Us meeting.

13:49.341 --> 13:52.013
Yeah. Yeah, I suppose so.

13:52.251 --> 13:54.106
Ah, thank you. There you go!

13:54.801 --> 13:57.458
But, as you said, long time ago now.

13:57.661 --> 13:59.513
You've got a new wife

14:00.052 --> 14:03.145
and a big new house, by all accounts.

14:03.474 --> 14:04.853
Life carries on.

14:05.013 --> 14:08.093
Yeah, yeah. It does. For most of us.

14:10.528 --> 14:12.216
Shall we open a bottle?

14:12.264 --> 14:13.841
I actually brought a couple.

14:14.077 --> 14:18.435
Oh! Well, er, let's, er...

14:19.048 --> 14:22.557
Mmm... put these to chill,
start with one of mine.

14:22.714 --> 14:26.247
All right? There's a vineyard

14:26.442 --> 14:31.685
in Ledoc, and my half-brother
owns a stake in it,

14:32.051 --> 14:34.364
brings me these bottles back.

14:36.418 --> 14:38.484
Is that your son?

14:39.117 --> 14:42.255
Yes. He's at university now.

14:42.466 --> 14:44.457
I didn't realise you had any children.

14:45.192 --> 14:47.032
Harry is
the product of an unhappy

14:47.094 --> 14:49.224
and short-lived relationship
with a man called Evan.

14:49.394 --> 14:52.443
Evan had issues, which, when we
were younger, appeared to be charm

14:52.491 --> 14:56.044
and ambition, but, as he got
older, were revealed to be

14:56.231 --> 14:57.790
bitterness and aggression.

14:59.269 --> 15:00.358
Cheers.

15:01.278 --> 15:02.731
Does Harry see much of him?

15:02.801 --> 15:04.255
Not if I can help it.

15:04.488 --> 15:06.227
His dad's a shit.

15:07.942 --> 15:09.220
Harry is amazing.

15:09.268 --> 15:11.942
And it's precisely
because I kept them apart.

15:12.536 --> 15:14.911
What about you? You're
divorced. How's your son?

15:15.247 --> 15:19.177
He's... fine. I think.

15:20.407 --> 15:22.317
And do you see much of his dad?

15:24.458 --> 15:25.841
No.

15:25.899 --> 15:30.239
Yeah, big house, big
mortgage, but it's worth it.

15:30.739 --> 15:33.652
But, after everything that happened,
how... how can you afford it?

15:36.192 --> 15:38.058
- What?
- You've not been the most

15:38.138 --> 15:39.419
discreet person in the past.

15:39.491 --> 15:41.270
Well, I was led astray.

15:41.341 --> 15:44.661
- And how do I know it won't happen again?
- With Gemma?

15:46.352 --> 15:47.661
Once was enough.

15:49.841 --> 15:53.614
OK, well, the truth is Kate's
dad gave us a few thousand.

15:53.684 --> 15:56.356
Then a mate had a tip-off in
an American energy company,

15:56.497 --> 15:58.825
fracking, whatever. It doesn't matter.

15:58.880 --> 16:00.950
The point is we invested what we could,

16:01.031 --> 16:04.442
and within a year,
I mean, wow!

16:04.599 --> 16:06.370
- You did well?
- Unbelievable.

16:06.419 --> 16:07.770
Ah.

16:07.903 --> 16:09.930
You... you liked it? The space?

16:09.989 --> 16:11.085
- Yeah.
- Yeah, small businesses

16:11.132 --> 16:14.270
love the idea of a shared ethos.

16:14.653 --> 16:18.177
And the community café acts
as a... as a hub which...

16:19.193 --> 16:20.731
Distracted?

16:21.191 --> 16:23.763
What? No.

16:24.161 --> 16:26.911
No, I am past all that now.

16:27.903 --> 16:29.492
Happily married.

16:33.125 --> 16:34.825
What was she like?

16:35.861 --> 16:37.920
My wife, when you slept with her?

16:39.700 --> 16:43.177
I... mate...

16:43.475 --> 16:44.924
Did you have fun?

16:46.081 --> 16:47.778
Yeah, we did.

16:48.230 --> 16:49.761
But you wouldn't go there again?

16:52.270 --> 16:54.753
Like tequila. Great at the time.

16:54.888 --> 16:56.250
Not worth the hangover.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.859
Tequila!

16:59.596 --> 17:01.716
Did she strip off at the end of the bed?

17:02.817 --> 17:04.881
She likes to slowly take her
clothes off in front of you.

17:04.928 --> 17:06.560
It's a thing she does.
Turns her on.

17:07.791 --> 17:11.339
- You really want to know?
- Good body, right? For her age.

17:11.480 --> 17:14.260
I suppose. Yeah, great body.

17:14.409 --> 17:17.089
She used to tense. You're
right in the middle of it,

17:17.330 --> 17:20.089
and she... she'd come and get
these, like, electric shocks,

17:20.221 --> 17:22.721
all the way through her body,
right in the middle of fucking.

17:22.987 --> 17:25.010
I miss that. Did she do that?

17:25.171 --> 17:26.443
You would remember.

17:26.690 --> 17:28.455
I'm not sure I want to
share that information.

17:28.502 --> 17:31.354
"Don't want to share."
You used to over share.

17:31.487 --> 17:33.057
Every time I saw you we were
supposed to be talking about

17:33.104 --> 17:36.268
investment options and you'd be
explaining what a butter churner was.

17:38.526 --> 17:40.265
Bet you tried it.

17:42.649 --> 17:44.354
Nearly broke my neck.

17:47.581 --> 17:49.880
Well, 
I'm a very different man now.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.378
Another?

17:55.501 --> 17:56.860
Sure.

18:01.378 --> 18:03.620
- Did it in the middle of a field.
- Sorry?

18:03.768 --> 18:07.667
I mean the wedding!
Oh, God! Oh, God! No! Not sex. Never.

18:07.862 --> 18:10.460
Evan told me very early on he
didn't like sex in "weird places".

18:10.518 --> 18:12.885
I wanted to do it in a
car once and he was like,

18:12.967 --> 18:15.677
"No, it's dangerous."
I asked him why.

18:15.725 --> 18:17.677
He said, "What if you
knocked the handbrake off?

18:17.725 --> 18:19.607
Grabbed it by accident
in the throes of passion."

18:19.655 --> 18:22.490
I said, "If your penis
feels like a handbrake

18:22.581 --> 18:24.779
we have got bigger problems"!

18:26.358 --> 18:28.177
What about you? Any strange places?

18:28.321 --> 18:31.410
We did it in a castle
once. My ex and me.

18:31.513 --> 18:34.130
- Sorry?
- Castles. He liked castles.

18:34.178 --> 18:35.373
Oh, geek.

18:35.427 --> 18:37.156
I didn't mind them, actually.

18:37.310 --> 18:38.683
We were at this one by the sea,

18:38.732 --> 18:40.654
and they were kicking
everyone out, so we hid.

18:40.702 --> 18:42.826
And then we fucked each
other in the battlements.

18:46.411 --> 18:49.770
After Evan, I never had
sex with another man.

18:50.086 --> 18:53.247
- Really?
- Too messy. Women all the way.

18:53.421 --> 18:55.325
I tell you, it's better.

18:56.825 --> 18:58.374
You were married how long?

18:58.461 --> 18:59.669
15 years.

18:59.821 --> 19:01.403
And you divorced?

19:02.088 --> 19:03.867
For two years.

19:04.118 --> 19:06.005
Something they don't tell you.

19:06.241 --> 19:10.012
That indent on your finger,
where you had the ring?

19:11.967 --> 19:13.512
It never goes.

19:16.972 --> 19:18.887
Why did my son come to see you?

19:20.665 --> 19:22.411
You saw him leave.
I thought so.

19:22.459 --> 19:23.482
Why was he there?

19:23.530 --> 19:25.442
Yes.
You know I can't tell you.

19:25.588 --> 19:27.645
I know but I thought
since we were drunk...

19:27.693 --> 19:29.332
I'm not drunk.

19:29.903 --> 19:32.372
Could you at least explain
why he went to see you,

19:32.434 --> 19:33.512
and not his own doctor?

19:33.591 --> 19:35.870
Cos his own doctor is
one of your best friends.

19:36.005 --> 19:37.309
So, why you?

19:37.421 --> 19:39.044
He knew we weren't close.

19:39.092 --> 19:40.201
How?

19:40.249 --> 19:41.833
You told him I was impossible.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.167
I don't think you're impossible.

19:43.215 --> 19:44.963
- You do.
- A little difficult perhaps.

19:45.011 --> 19:47.270
- I think you're impossible.
- Unbelievably competitive.

19:47.318 --> 19:48.864
- You're smug.
- I'm glad I came for dinner.

19:48.911 --> 19:50.762
- Did you like the fish?
- No.

19:50.919 --> 19:54.536
Look, Tom suddenly went
to live with his dad

19:54.787 --> 19:57.416
and his dad is a very bad influence.

19:57.677 --> 20:00.356
Now, on top of all that,
I'm worried that he might not be well.

20:00.409 --> 20:01.808
But if you won't tell me...

20:03.199 --> 20:04.788
I get it.

20:05.031 --> 20:06.317
You're a professional.

20:06.445 --> 20:08.270
It's... it's good.

20:09.530 --> 20:11.029
It actually is.

20:11.286 --> 20:12.950
Principles.

20:13.389 --> 20:14.988
I like that.

20:19.841 --> 20:22.817
There is something
you don't know about me.

20:23.504 --> 20:25.841
Despite being a doctor,

20:26.872 --> 20:29.310
when I drink...

20:34.155 --> 20:35.466
I smoke.

20:39.069 --> 20:40.808
So what are you going to do about Gemma?

20:41.192 --> 20:42.896
She thinks you're
scheming to make her leave

20:42.943 --> 20:45.481
and she doesn't understand
why Tom's moved in with you.

20:47.566 --> 20:50.795
- Why has he moved in with you?
- It's sad, isn't it?

20:52.292 --> 20:55.778
I take responsibility for everything
I've done, but I mean, two years?

20:56.716 --> 20:59.216
How difficult is it to
just get on with your life?

20:59.645 --> 21:01.754
Instead, she's stuck there.
Seething.

21:03.453 --> 21:04.887
A scheme?

21:06.622 --> 21:08.411
If I did, would you blame me?

21:10.786 --> 21:13.801
I know I cheated.
Hands up to that.

21:14.075 --> 21:16.817
But by the time she'd finished with me,
I had a criminal record,

21:16.952 --> 21:19.809
no friends, no career,
my son hated me...

21:20.089 --> 21:23.637
I made a mistake but what she did
wasn't fair, it wasn't justice,

21:23.685 --> 21:24.716
simply revenge.

21:24.764 --> 21:26.661
- Mate, I'm not getting involved...
- So would you blame me

21:26.708 --> 21:29.637
if when I get an opportunity,
I look for a way to get my son back

21:29.708 --> 21:31.622
and remove her from my life?

21:36.024 --> 21:38.380
Put it this way.
I'm winning.

21:42.639 --> 21:44.788
She said you should buy her a drink.

21:46.248 --> 21:47.653
Ha!

21:55.559 --> 21:58.357
- Anxiety.
- What?

21:59.012 --> 22:02.341
Tom's unusually conscientious
for a 15-year-old boy

22:02.700 --> 22:05.583
but
I suppose he is your son.

22:07.112 --> 22:08.419
He heard you in the past,

22:08.467 --> 22:11.036
talking about a patient
with the same symptoms.

22:11.469 --> 22:14.044
Not sleeping. Negative thoughts.

22:14.301 --> 22:18.145
He said he'd recently left home
and moved in with his dad.

22:18.651 --> 22:20.153
Did he say why?

22:20.262 --> 22:21.471
No.

22:22.669 --> 22:24.738
And what did you suggest
that he do?

22:24.841 --> 22:26.513
I said with everything
he's been going through,

22:26.560 --> 22:29.950
I'd be... worried if his brain
wasn't reacting like that.

22:30.214 --> 22:32.052
Was he really upset?

22:32.623 --> 22:34.247
It's understandable.

22:35.048 --> 22:37.473
I told him to come back and
see me whenever he wants.

22:37.665 --> 22:38.965
Good.

22:39.739 --> 22:40.818
Thank you.

22:42.083 --> 22:44.468
And I promised him
I wouldn't tell you anything.

22:46.236 --> 22:48.106
You're clearly very persuasive.

22:51.359 --> 22:56.098
So, there is dessert.
Two minutes.

22:57.039 --> 22:58.567
Sian?

22:58.959 --> 23:01.578
I was lying before. The
fish, it was really good.

23:02.759 --> 23:04.028
I know.

23:12.265 --> 23:13.724
What?

23:17.570 --> 23:18.945
You don't believe me?

23:19.092 --> 23:20.547
No.

23:20.989 --> 23:22.617
You want to see the scar?

23:23.202 --> 23:25.076
What, here? No,
thank you.

23:29.009 --> 23:32.367
I'm sorry about Fiona. She's
got kids. Needs to be up early.

23:32.709 --> 23:34.383
I've got kids, too, so...

23:34.582 --> 23:36.742
What about you, Neil? Children?

23:36.851 --> 23:38.828
No chance. Uh-uh.

23:40.107 --> 23:46.734
No, I value sleep,
time, happiness, style.

23:47.539 --> 23:51.625
- You don't like responsibility.
- Not particularly.

23:52.414 --> 23:56.242
Me too. Sometimes I just like
to get on my horse and off I go

23:56.289 --> 23:57.570

- Oh!

23:57.726 --> 24:01.570
No plan, I just... go.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.422
You ride.

24:04.865 --> 24:06.578
Yeah. I ride.

24:10.790 --> 24:12.059
Sorry!

24:12.169 --> 24:14.458
Sorry, that's really very funny!

24:18.273 --> 24:21.106

24:22.915 --> 24:26.270
Mmm.

24:27.749 --> 24:29.808

But you said he was coming over.

27:10.869 --> 27:14.064

Said he didn't feel like going out.

My son.

28:07.722 --> 28:12.741
I found cigarettes in his room at
his dad's, where he also got drunk.

- No, don't think so. Not yet.
- But he smokes?

29:16.298 --> 29:19.938
Sometimes. At parties.
If other people are.

29:21.579 --> 29:23.173
Does he drink a lot?

29:23.332 --> 29:27.071
No. Just... normal.

29:27.439 --> 29:29.524
- He like girls?
- Yeah.

29:30.379 --> 29:31.433

He's been to the doctor's.
Because he's not sleeping, apparently.

- No.

29:59.423 --> 30:01.641
Well, maybe you should
talk about these things.

30:01.696 --> 30:03.227
He says he doesn't love you.

30:11.505 --> 30:12.914
When did he say that?

30:14.092 --> 30:16.618
At school. Yesterday.

30:17.460 --> 30:21.069
We were talking and,

- I'm not up for this. Not here.
- Why not?

35:27.663 --> 35:29.620
They might be my students.

35:30.049 --> 35:32.795
- So, how amazing will you seem?
- Seriously.

35:32.949 --> 35:34.029
Oh.

35:34.204 --> 35:37.701
Oh, OK. Seriously.

35:38.993 --> 35:42.889
There is nothing
I want more than to...

35:49.085 --> 35:51.975
It's not the offer.
It's the context.

35:52.149 --> 35:53.546
Context!

35:53.725 --> 35:55.639
- God, I love that!
- What?

35:55.756 --> 35:58.248
Just how you talk.

36:02.285 --> 36:04.107
Want to come back to mine?

36:04.826 --> 36:07.873
What? No! This is good.

36:08.840 --> 36:12.303
Look, maybe we should, er,
maybe we should call it a night?

36:12.600 --> 36:14.014
OK...

36:14.850 --> 36:17.394
Doesn't like sex in weird places.

36:20.803 --> 36:23.074
You go home, if you want to.

36:25.416 --> 36:27.005
You'll be all right?

36:27.199 --> 36:28.456
Yeah...

36:29.479 --> 36:31.638
I'll be amazing.

36:32.818 --> 36:34.547
Bye.

36:40.802 --> 36:43.091
Breakfast tomorrow, though,
yeah?

36:43.161 --> 36:44.513
Sure.

37:11.542 --> 37:13.181
Oi! What are you doing?

37:14.635 --> 37:16.440
I said what the fuck are you doing?

37:16.652 --> 37:21.760
Having the kind of night that
I haven't had in... 15 years.

37:23.119 --> 37:24.955
God, I'm shitfaced.

37:25.235 --> 37:27.432
I am desperate for another drink

37:27.495 --> 37:30.550
and that's exactly how I want
to feel cos I haven't got a clue

37:30.643 --> 37:33.112
what's going on in
my life at the moment.

37:34.987 --> 37:36.799
I'm also a doctor
who's putting your mate

37:36.847 --> 37:39.221
in the recovery position
so he doesn't die.

37:39.352 --> 37:40.915
You don't look like a doctor.

37:41.243 --> 37:42.518
No white coat.

37:42.703 --> 37:44.252
You're hot.

37:44.827 --> 37:46.860
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:47.320 --> 37:48.819
You think I'm hot?

37:49.847 --> 37:53.636
- Yeah, why not?
- Yeah? You want to suck me off?

37:55.955 --> 37:58.052
- Do you want to fuck me?
- Yeah.

37:58.535 --> 38:00.245
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:03.997 --> 38:05.909
Then it's not your night.

38:06.292 --> 38:08.235
- What?
- Take him home.

38:30.867 --> 38:32.316
Simon?

38:37.062 --> 38:38.471
Simon!

38:46.967 --> 38:48.466
I know some...

38:53.151 --> 38:55.146
I'm going to tell you something.

39:43.107 --> 39:46.540
- Hi.
- Had a good night?

39:47.537 --> 39:52.506
Simon's done something, and now
apparently my son doesn't love me.

39:54.727 --> 39:56.389
Neil not back?

39:56.660 --> 39:58.973
He won't be now. It's too late.

39:59.201 --> 40:01.733
- Oh, you mean...
- He'll stay out.

40:02.909 --> 40:04.209
I thought you'd agreed

40:04.326 --> 40:06.497
- he wasn't going to do that any more.
- We did.

40:08.693 --> 40:12.216
- I hope you got what you needed.
- Anna...

40:15.410 --> 40:16.519
are you all right?

40:16.567 --> 40:17.926
I'm going to stay up for a bit,

40:17.974 --> 40:20.410
- do a few things.
- What things?

40:20.583 --> 40:21.966
Big things.

40:24.403 --> 40:25.895
Go to bed.

42:06.507 --> 42:08.426
Shit...

42:13.257 --> 42:15.658
Hello, I'm Nigel from
Golding and Golding.

42:15.744 --> 42:18.336
I believe your husband called
us about a valuation on your...

42:43.717 --> 42:45.259
Well, you were never going
to make it to the café.

42:45.306 --> 42:48.269
So I thought I'd deliver.
Croissants, fruits.

42:48.359 --> 42:51.078
Could only find one
yoghurt. But we could share?

42:59.567 --> 43:00.871
Erm...

43:01.077 --> 43:03.597
I haven't cleaned my
teeth yet this morning.

43:11.006 --> 43:12.505
How are you?

43:13.625 --> 43:14.894
Headache.

43:17.175 --> 43:19.076
You've been getting
drunk a lot recently.

43:19.223 --> 43:20.550
I know.

43:21.292 --> 43:25.035
Plates are in there.
Smoking, too.

43:25.219 --> 43:26.376
Sorry?

43:26.546 --> 43:28.722
I've started smoking again as well.

43:29.386 --> 43:30.809
It's really bad.

43:31.682 --> 43:34.211
This is what you're going
to have to deal with.

43:34.582 --> 43:36.621
I'm not into emotional intimacy.

43:36.913 --> 43:40.840
- That makes sense.
- I don't mean sex. I have sex.

43:41.097 --> 43:43.433
Early part of this year there
was a guy called Charlie.

43:43.482 --> 43:45.339
28. Really attractive.

43:45.431 --> 43:46.855
- OK.
- Met in a café,

43:46.911 --> 43:48.271
went back to his,
slept together.

43:48.410 --> 43:51.144
But I loved that there
was no strings attached.

43:51.781 --> 43:53.527
But then he started to
have feelings for me,

43:53.575 --> 43:56.255
and wanted to talk about my life,
and I just wasn't into that. So...

43:56.558 --> 43:59.146
- You broke up?
- I started paying him.

44:01.333 --> 44:02.782
50 quid a time.

44:04.144 --> 44:05.590
He didn't have much money,

44:05.667 --> 44:07.546
and that made it clear
what the deal was about.

44:07.623 --> 44:08.690
How did that work out?

44:08.767 --> 44:12.394
We did it twice and then he texted
to say he thought it was insulting.

44:13.962 --> 44:15.839
I didn't see him again.

44:21.427 --> 44:22.966
Why are you telling me all this?

44:23.128 --> 44:26.346
Essentially, I'm alerting you
to the fact that I thought I was just

44:26.423 --> 44:30.308
about doing OK but then my husband
coming back has changed things.

44:30.417 --> 44:32.640
It's really thrown me.

44:32.917 --> 44:34.926
So maybe Tom's right to leave.

44:35.003 --> 44:36.770
Messed-up Mum.

44:36.917 --> 44:38.746
- I'm not put off by all this.
- You should be.

44:38.793 --> 44:40.714
Because you're telling me.
You're being honest.

44:40.785 --> 44:43.185
I just thought you ought to
know before you got too involved.

44:43.275 --> 44:46.008
I think you're telling me
because it's time to change.

44:46.171 --> 44:48.204
Change to what?
Sit down.

44:48.683 --> 44:52.464
You miss Tom.
You want him to come home?

44:52.653 --> 44:54.852
I want to make sure that
he takes care of himself.

44:54.993 --> 44:59.324
And I would... very much like to have
a proper conversation with him.

45:01.652 --> 45:03.980
Yes, of course I want him to come home.

45:04.296 --> 45:05.917
Have you spoken to him about it?

45:06.199 --> 45:09.476
- Not since he left. He won't answer.
- He loves you.

45:10.667 --> 45:13.786
Thanks, but you really have
no idea what he feels about me.

45:16.376 --> 45:18.128
Why are you interested in me?

45:18.176 --> 45:20.565
Because most people would
make an excuse and run away,

45:20.733 --> 45:22.650
and count themselves lucky.

45:22.972 --> 45:24.996
You really don't have
to stay out of concern.

45:25.044 --> 45:26.199
Change to what?

45:26.251 --> 45:29.058
- I... I beg your pardon?
- Because things have changed.

45:29.267 --> 45:32.320
Your husband's come back.
Your son's moved out.

45:32.527 --> 45:34.199
So what do you do?
You keep everything the same?

45:34.246 --> 45:36.707
You try and ignore it?
Or change?

45:38.339 --> 45:40.136
What are you, like, a guru?

45:40.218 --> 45:43.481
I'm a teacher. We're pretty
good at giving clear guidance,

45:43.542 --> 45:45.628
- when required.
- Oh, fuck you.

45:45.827 --> 45:47.251
I would like that.

45:48.503 --> 45:50.102
But not for money.

46:25.695 --> 46:28.224
That might be the best I've ever had.

46:30.602 --> 46:32.011
How about you?

46:34.235 --> 46:36.344
Yeah, it was good.

47:09.021 --> 47:10.660
Oh, God.

47:16.665 --> 47:18.164
So... er...

47:20.278 --> 47:23.647
Yeah, er, believe it or not,
he's... he's made the money.

47:24.915 --> 47:26.602
Been very lucky by the sounds of it.

47:26.883 --> 47:30.990
Kate's dad gave them
an amount, erm, he put it in

47:31.038 --> 47:33.491
some American investment,
fracking, apparently.

47:33.675 --> 47:35.508
Ah, he used the dividend
to fund the house,

47:35.556 --> 47:36.939
to borrow against for the business.

47:36.986 --> 47:40.922
His business partner called Mark,
who runs it with him. And then I...

47:43.743 --> 47:46.688
I couldn't find out anything
more about Tom or why...

47:48.110 --> 47:49.334
Or why...

47:52.212 --> 47:53.711
Neil.

47:58.403 --> 47:59.952
Neil.

48:06.245 --> 48:10.578
When I got back this morning,
erm, she packed a bag for me.

48:10.670 --> 48:12.879
Said it was over.
We'd made a commitment to each other,

48:13.003 --> 48:19.157
I'd failed. She'd... she'd sort
my stuff and... and send it on.

48:26.994 --> 48:30.133
I shouldn't have gone last night.
It's not your fault.

48:37.780 --> 48:39.519
I don't know where I'm going to go.

48:39.643 --> 48:41.197
You stay at mine.

48:43.001 --> 48:44.690
I don't think that would help much.

48:46.711 --> 48:50.320
Anyway I'm, er, I'm used to a hotel.

48:52.005 --> 48:56.794
- She will get over this.
- She won't. Not now.

48:59.515 --> 49:02.603
Sorry. Anyway, so that's,
erm, all I could find out.

49:02.651 --> 49:04.544
No, it's useful.

49:06.811 --> 49:08.550
Thank you.

49:11.134 --> 49:13.756
Simon hates you.

49:19.715 --> 49:23.006
Hates me, too. He knew what
he was doing last night.

49:23.181 --> 49:24.725
He got me drunk and

49:25.460 --> 49:27.741
when I woke up this morning
and realised what had happened

49:29.037 --> 49:31.639
I knew she'd never forgive me again.

49:39.108 --> 49:42.708
But, yeah, he hates you
and knows everything.

49:43.538 --> 49:45.038
Someone's talking to him.

49:45.295 --> 49:47.774
Is there anyone you don't trust?

49:49.818 --> 49:53.901
The headache's still there.
Have you had the blood test back?

49:55.110 --> 49:57.668
- One minute, please!
- Oh! Gemma.

49:57.840 --> 49:59.561
I was just finishing up with Mr Ward...

49:59.663 --> 50:00.820
Gordon, could you give us a moment?

50:00.867 --> 50:02.684
She's about to tell me what's wrong.

50:02.741 --> 50:04.428
- Honestly, I just...
- Doctor Lambert

50:04.476 --> 50:07.449
will finish up properly in a moment,
if you just step outside.

50:15.265 --> 50:17.374
You missed dessert,
did I do something wrong?

50:17.422 --> 50:18.819
I checked your CV.

50:19.124 --> 50:23.631
Simon, my ex-husband, did
economics at Warwick, same year.

50:23.831 --> 50:25.088
You know him.

50:25.366 --> 50:27.054
I don't think so.
I don't remember any Simons.

50:27.101 --> 50:29.710
That wasn't a question.
You know him.

50:30.778 --> 50:35.217
He said he'd spoken to some old friends,
but it was you, wasn't it?

50:35.311 --> 50:37.358
- Talking about me.
- Gemma, I can't...

50:37.406 --> 50:40.319
I could find out.
I could go on Facebook, check records.

50:40.987 --> 50:44.190
I don't take well to
people who lie to me.

50:44.743 --> 50:46.712
You can guess why.

50:48.925 --> 50:50.728
All right, yes.

50:50.913 --> 50:54.008
I know him from university
but not well.

50:54.217 --> 50:58.264
The job came up, he lived nearby,
and I asked him about the area.

50:58.402 --> 51:03.163
He said I should go for it, but
that his ex-wife was the senior GP,

51:03.381 --> 51:05.062
wouldn't take it well if
I mentioned the connection,

51:05.109 --> 51:07.756
and that she was leaving soon
anyway so there wasn't any point...

51:07.804 --> 51:09.874
- Leaving?
- Yes, he said within a month

51:10.022 --> 51:11.382
of him moving back,
you'd be gone.

51:11.441 --> 51:13.398
So you want my job,
you're working with him to get rid of me?

51:13.445 --> 51:14.780
- Don't be ridiculous.
- It's not!

51:14.828 --> 51:16.007
Because you've been reporting back

51:16.054 --> 51:17.375
- to my ex-husband...
- No, no, no!

51:17.422 --> 51:18.726
On everything that I've been doing.

51:18.773 --> 51:20.030
I have not been reporting back.

51:20.078 --> 51:22.764
He calls and asks and
I tell him the truth.

51:22.869 --> 51:24.080
- Get out.

51:24.143 --> 51:26.103
- Er, being friends with your 
boss's ex isn't,

51:26.151 --> 51:27.523
as far as I know, 
grounds for dismissal.

51:27.570 --> 51:29.210
You don't need to work any notice.

51:29.397 --> 51:34.686
Gem... Gemma, we didn't get on,
so maybe I wasn't hugely positive

51:34.734 --> 51:38.697
about you with Simon to begin with,
but I always told him the truth.

51:38.998 --> 51:41.881
And now that I've got to know
you, especially what I found out

51:41.929 --> 51:46.682
yesterday, well, it's clear,
you're not the one with the problem.

51:48.225 --> 51:49.319
Really?

51:49.444 --> 51:54.210
Yes. Look, Gemma, last night
you wanted to know about Tom.

51:54.258 --> 51:56.787
I wanted to know about you.
Now I do.

51:57.483 --> 51:59.944
You're a good person
and an excellent doctor.

52:00.530 --> 52:02.522
I hugely respect you.

52:02.999 --> 52:07.271
And that's why in the end
I told you about Tom and not him.

52:08.345 --> 52:10.545
After everything you said...

52:11.040 --> 52:13.163
I get what you're up against.

52:14.359 --> 52:16.249
And, well...

52:16.494 --> 52:20.592
I very rarely feel the
need to apologise but...

52:22.776 --> 52:24.275
sorry.

52:33.814 --> 52:35.503
So, what now?

52:54.074 --> 52:56.563
- Drink, madam?
- No, thanks.

53:00.895 --> 53:02.904
I'm so sorry, could you
excuse me for a moment?

53:03.549 --> 53:04.998
Not here.

53:25.249 --> 53:27.382
- Tom's coming home.
- Tom is home.

53:27.430 --> 53:29.363
You've told him something.
Lied to him.

53:29.429 --> 53:31.304
Why would you think that?
Because he's suddenly changed

53:31.351 --> 53:34.428
- and it doesn't make sense.
- Well, now he's got all the facts.

53:35.725 --> 53:37.034
What does that mean?

53:41.255 --> 53:42.789
You look better than
when I last saw you.

53:42.836 --> 53:45.584
I hope you had a good night.
What was it you wanted to say?

53:45.836 --> 53:48.240
You shouted last night you
had something to tell me.

53:48.389 --> 53:49.636
You know Sian.

53:50.001 --> 53:51.614
You told her to apply for the job.

53:51.755 --> 53:54.257
She saw it and asked me,
I thought it was a good opportunity...

53:54.304 --> 53:56.951
You said when you came back
that I'd be gone within a month.

53:57.224 --> 53:58.597
You will be.

53:59.428 --> 54:01.644
What's your house worth
in the end? Did they say?

54:03.707 --> 54:05.647
There is something I could tell you,

54:05.838 --> 54:07.148
- that I know.
- Go ahead.

54:07.225 --> 54:09.381
- It would hurt you.
- Go on, then.

54:10.505 --> 54:12.061
I was watching your house last night

54:12.109 --> 54:14.142
and saw Kate with a man that wasn't you.

54:14.314 --> 54:16.587
Mark's her godfather.
Anything else?

54:22.675 --> 54:24.084
Go home...

54:25.518 --> 54:27.623
pack your things, and leave.

54:28.345 --> 54:31.420
You're going to go away again and Tom...

54:32.725 --> 54:34.542
Tom's going to come back 
and live with me.

54:34.605 --> 54:35.669
Or what?

54:35.717 --> 54:38.295
Or I'll go to the lenders that
you've borrowed money from and

54:38.376 --> 54:41.299
inform them of your mismanagement
of your previous business.

54:41.412 --> 54:42.754
The "lenders".

54:43.717 --> 54:46.764
Yeah. Did Neil get home
all right in the morning?

54:46.935 --> 54:49.115
She was very attractive.
I hope they had a good time.

54:49.163 --> 54:51.787
You wanted him to go off with her.
You knew that he promised Anna...

54:51.834 --> 54:53.575
What Neil does is entirely up to him.

54:53.623 --> 54:55.450
But on the other hand,
yes, of course.

54:55.971 --> 54:57.434
He slept with my wife.

55:03.490 --> 55:06.439
I really think you need to
see someone professional now.

55:10.891 --> 55:12.390
Your eye's twitching.

55:25.708 --> 55:26.877
Yes?

55:29.046 --> 55:30.545
He's...?

55:32.248 --> 55:34.755
- Yes, of course. 20 minutes.
- Who's that?

55:34.916 --> 55:36.763
- It doesn't matter.
- Is it about Tom?

56:07.124 --> 56:08.543
Was that what you wanted to tell me?

56:08.590 --> 56:10.124
That you knew how I got the money,

56:10.172 --> 56:12.202
the investment in the American company?

56:13.592 --> 56:15.561
You didn't believe it, did you?

56:16.045 --> 56:17.278
Fracking?

56:18.300 --> 56:21.304
I thought you probably sent him
after me. Just turning up like that?

56:21.453 --> 56:24.907
Not convincing. Fun night,
though. Compared notes on you.

56:24.955 --> 56:26.443
- He said you weren't bad.
- Really?

56:26.494 --> 56:27.579
For your age.

56:34.000 --> 56:35.893
- Tom?
- Mate...

56:36.492 --> 56:37.963
Tom's been in a fight.

56:38.039 --> 56:40.009
Mr Foster, perhaps you'd
like to take a seat.

56:40.086 --> 56:41.109
- Mum, I'm fine.
- Gemma.

56:41.186 --> 56:42.186
What happened?

56:42.234 --> 56:45.241
Well, we say a fight,
but from what witnesses are saying,

56:45.289 --> 56:46.577
it was more like an attack.

56:46.625 --> 56:47.782
Who attacked him?

56:47.830 --> 56:49.296
He attacked another boy.

56:49.354 --> 56:50.611
Max Gosford.

56:50.790 --> 56:53.062
We're going to wait to
speak to Max's parents to see

56:53.110 --> 56:54.726
whether they want to
involve the police.

56:54.803 --> 56:56.195
- Mate...
- Let her finish.

56:56.243 --> 56:58.867
But for now Tom's immediately excluded.

56:59.980 --> 57:02.599
So he needs to go home
straight away. All right?

57:02.676 --> 57:04.009
Yes.
