00:02.090 --> 00:03.980
Well,That Was Relaxing.

00:04.130 --> 00:06.420
I Didn't Mean To Hear You And Your Bodyguard Having Sex.

00:06.580 --> 00:10.000
Keep Your Mouth Shut And Your Old Man Comes Home.

00:10.150 --> 00:13.870
So Lie To Daniel? Don't Lie. Just Don't Say Anything.

00:14.020 --> 00:16.490
"I'm Your Husband." Bloody Hell.

00:16.640 --> 00:18.660
This Is My Friend. My Friend?

00:18.810 --> 00:21.720
I Don't Think He's Your Friend. I'm His Boyfriend. Or Should I Say "Was"?

00:21.870 --> 00:23.860
Cliff, I Really Screwed Up.

00:24.020 --> 00:26.870
I Have Hundreds Of Backstabbing, Two-Faced,Superficial Friends

00:27.010 --> 00:28.280

00:30.390 --> 00:33.950
To Be My Maid Of Honor. You Only Have Five Months Left With Henry.

00:34.100 --> 00:37.790
Go. The Clock Is Ticking. Maybe We Shouldn't Tell Dad.

00:37.950 --> 00:40.540
I'm Romantic,Not Crazy.

00:44.160 --> 00:47.920

It's The Countdown To The Brad-Elmina Wedding.

00:58.030 --> 00:59.710
It's A National Holiday.

00:59.860 --> 01:03.300
I Don't Even Think There's Mail Today. Okay.

01:05.150 --> 01:07.100
Betty, Breakfast Is Ready.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.490
I Know You Haven't Had Much Of An Appetite

01:08.630 --> 01:09.800
Since This Whole Mess With Henry,

01:09.950 --> 01:12.020
But I Made Blueberry Pancakes.

01:12.180 --> 01:13.200
No,Thanks.

01:13.360 --> 01:16.180

Oh,Good. I Love Blueberry Pancakes.

01:32.680 --> 01:35.430
How'd You Know I Was Making Blueberry Pancakes?

01:35.580 --> 01:38.220
Because You Just Said So.

01:38.380 --> 01:40.890
Somebody's Getting Old.

01:42.610 --> 01:45.670
Canadian Bacon. Are You Having A Stroke?

01:45.820 --> 01:47.630
That's The Only Thing That Got Betty's Appetite Back

01:47.780 --> 01:49.110
After Joey Lawrence Was Kicked Off

01:49.260 --> 01:51.430
That "Dancing With The Stars."

01:51.560 --> 01:54.180
Maybe That'll Do The Trick

01:55.630 --> 01:57.700
(Sighs) I Gotta Get A Life.

01:58.220 --> 01:59.570
<I>Ay,Dios M鞳.</I>

02:04.650 --> 02:05.990
<I>Mija?</I>

02:50.600 --> 02:52.180
The Bakery Hasn't Finished The Cake,

02:52.320 --> 02:54.250
I Still Have To Finalize The Seating Chart,

02:54.400 --> 02:55.900
And Wilhelmina Said If There's Baby's Breath

02:56.050 --> 02:57.330
In Any Of The Floral Arrangements,

02:57.490 --> 02:59.330
She's Gonna Sand Off My Nipples.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.440
Wow,Cake And Nipples.

03:01.600 --> 03:03.470
I Don't Know Which One To Focus On. (Laughs)

03:03.620 --> 03:05.320
Okay,I'm On My Way To Graphics. By The Way,

03:05.460 --> 03:08.270
You Don't Happen To Know Where My Brown Blazer Is?

03:08.290 --> 03:10.970
Why? I'm Wearing It To The Wedding.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.760
That Corduroy Thing That's Held Together

03:12.910 --> 03:14.680
By Cat Hair And Ketchup Stains?

03:14.840 --> 03:18.390
Cliff,This Wedding Is So Fancy, Armani Is Wearing Prada.

Come On,I Mean, Do You Really Think

03:19.930 --> 03:21.570
That They're Gonna Be Looking At Me?

03:21.710 --> 03:23.930
You Have Rosie O'donnell Seated At The Same Table

03:24.080 --> 03:25.080
As Elisabeth Hasselbeck.

03:25.250 --> 03:28.130
What? Oh,My God! How Did That Happen?

03:28.280 --> 03:29.670
Okay,I've Got Too Much To Do Today.

03:29.820 --> 03:31.440
If You Want To Wear That Jacket,Go Ahead.

03:31.590 --> 03:34.040
Seriously, You'd Be Okay With It? Yeah,It's Who You Are,

03:34.190 --> 03:36.440

We Wergetting Drunk First Thing In The Morning.

03:54.110 --> 03:55.950
Little Tribute To Mom? We're Celebrating.

03:56.090 --> 03:57.920
I Just Got Off The Phone With Ad Sales.

03:58.060 --> 04:01.200
They Are Very Happy. Oh,I Didn't Realize You'd Heard.

04:01.360 --> 04:03.610
Heard? Look At These Contracts--

04:03.750 --> 04:06.130
Louis Vuitton, Cartier,Ralph Lauren...

04:06.270 --> 04:07.790
Your Sister Scored Big.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.480
It Looks Like She Might Have Saved The Magazine.

04:09.630 --> 04:11.710
Yeah,Um,Did You See The Contract I Landed For Us?

04:11.860 --> 04:15.160
Winthrop Jewelry. That Was Mine. Yeah,Here It Is.

04:15.300 --> 04:17.140
They've Taken An 1/8th Of A Page In March.

04:17.300 --> 04:19.170
An 1/8th Of A Page? No-- Hey,That's Great.

04:19.279 --> 04:22.890
An Advertiser's An Advertiser, Right,Dad? Yes,Every Little Bit Helps.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.020
You Know,Alexis, Your Dedication

04:25.170 --> 04:26.890
Pleases Me More Than You'll Ever Know.

04:27.030 --> 04:29.330
Now I Realize That You Have Loyalty To Your Mother,

04:29.460 --> 04:31.200
But Would You Consider Standing Up With Me

04:31.340 --> 04:33.700
At My Wedding Tomorrow? Really?

04:33.850 --> 04:35.750
Wait A Second. I Thought I Was Your Best Man.

04:35.890 --> 04:38.130
Who Threw Your Bachelor Party Last Weekend At Scores,

04:38.280 --> 04:42.750
Mr. "I Need More Singles"? Ah,Cheyenne.

04:42.890 --> 04:45.880
Is She Still There? Oh,She Was My Favorite.

04:46.030 --> 04:47.960
<I>Does She Still Do That Thing? Oh,Yeah.</I>

04:48.120 --> 04:50.240
That's Not Free,By The Way. You Know What? Forget This.

04:50.380 --> 04:54.050
You Want To Make Alexis Your Best Man? Fine,Do It. Well,Why Don't You Both Do It Gether?

04:54.190 --> 04:54.800
You Know What,Dad?

04:54.940 --> 04:59.260
Maybe It's Better If Just Daniel Stands Up. I- No,No,No,No. Don't Worry About Me.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.970
<I>He Obviously Wants You Around.</I>

05:01.110 --> 05:03.830
You Really Shouldn't Disappoint Dad.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.340
It Might Kill Him.

05:05.490 --> 05:08.640
And You Wouldn't Want That, Would You,Alexis?

05:09.540 --> 05:10.930
<I>(Man) Coverage Of The Wilhelmina Slater Wedding</I>

05:11.070 --> 05:12.710
<I>Continues With Superstar Maid Of Honor</I>

05:12.860 --> 05:16.170
<I>Victoria Beckham... All Right With The Posing And The Waving.</I>

05:16.300 --> 05:18.900
We All Know You're Strong Enough To Raise Your Arm.

05:19.050 --> 05:21.790
She'smymaid Of Honor. This Is Supposed To Be About Me.

05:21.940 --> 05:23.290
<I>Pish-Tosh,It's Posh.</I>

05:23.430 --> 05:25.190
The Beckhams Have Conquered America.

05:25.350 --> 05:28.160
<I>Accept It. They're Our Leaders. So,Victoria,How Long</I>

05:28.310 --> 05:29.910
<I>Have You And Wilhelmina Known Each Other?</I>

05:30.060 --> 05:31.700
<I>Oh,Willie And I Go Way Back.</I>

05:31.840 --> 05:34.760
<I>She's Practically My Second Mom. What?</I>

05:34.910 --> 05:37.960
Mum. It's A Flower. She Thinks Of You As A Second Flower.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.350
It's A British Expression.

05:39.490 --> 05:40.470
<I>What Are You Getting The Happy Couple</I>

05:40.620 --> 05:41.400

05:41.540 --> 05:46.620
<I>Oh,Something Very Special. A Gift From The Heart.</I>

05:55.490 --> 05:57.350
Is She Hawking Her Sports Drink

05:57.500 --> 05:58.820
In The Middle Of My Wedding Interview?

05:58.970 --> 06:01.330
<I>Ok,You're Focusing On This Way Too Much.</I>

06:01.470 --> 06:03.110
Let's Not Forget That You're Only Getting Married

06:03.250 --> 06:05.230
So You Can Take Over Meade

06:05.440 --> 06:08.530
And Launch Your Own Fashion Magazine. Even That's Off Track.

06:08.690 --> 06:11.710
I Can't Start My Own Magazine Until We Bring Down "Mode."

06:11.970 --> 06:15.150
Apparently The Dynamic Duo, Danny And The Tranny,

06:15.300 --> 06:18.540
Have Gone And Found Some Advertisers To Save This Rag.

06:18.680 --> 06:20.980
Please. "Mode" Is Far From Being Out Of The Woods,

06:21.120 --> 06:22.820
And Once You Take Over The Whole Company,

06:22.960 --> 06:24.360
This Magazine Will Go Down

06:24.510 --> 06:27.320
Faster Than A Crack Whore At A Prison Rodeo.

06:27.470 --> 06:30.080
I Don't Know What The Means, But It Sounds Nasty.

06:30.220 --> 06:32.440
Oh,It's Nasty, Miss Jackson. (Laughs)

06:33.090 --> 06:35.430
<I>(Man) Does Anyone Look As Fabulous As Posh</I>

06:35.600 --> 06:36.930

06:41.180 --> 06:43.480
Okay,I'm Leaving To Work Now.

06:43.630 --> 06:45.170
Are You Still Not Talking To Me?

06:45.320 --> 06:47.990
What More Is There To Say? You've Been Sneaking Out,

06:48.140 --> 06:49.790
Seeing A Boy Who Got Another Girl Pregnant,

06:49.940 --> 06:51.760
Who's Moving Across The Country In A Few Months,

06:51.910 --> 06:52.750
And You're Foolish Enough To Think

06:52.900 --> 06:55.740
This Is Some Big Romance. Justin,Go Watch Upstairs.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.520
Mom! You See,Dad? This Is Exactly Why I Didn't Tell You.

06:58.660 --> 07:03.000
Look,I Love Henry,Okay? I've Never Felt This Way Before.

07:03.150 --> 07:04.440
Do You Hear Yourself?

07:04.590 --> 07:07.190
You're Talking Like Some Silly 13-Year-Old Girl.

07:07.340 --> 07:09.530
Use Your Head,Betty. He's Going To Leave,

07:09.670 --> 07:11.050
And You're Gonna Have Your Heart Broken. Well,That's My--

07:11.220 --> 07:13.520
Can We Just Calm Down,Please, And Discuss This?

07:13.670 --> 07:15.140
Don't Think I've Forgotten That You Knew About This

07:15.280 --> 07:19.080
The Whole Time And Were Covering For Her! Okay,I Think The Important Thing Here

07:19.210 --> 07:22.360
Is That We Focus On Betty. You Want Me To Focus On Betty? I'll Focus On Betty.

07:22.510 --> 07:27.020
You're Not Seeing Henry Again. Dad,I'm 23 Years Old. You Can't Tell Me Who I Can See.

07:27.170 --> 07:28.780
I Can If You're Living In This House!

07:28.930 --> 07:31.210
Then Maybe I Shouldn't Be Living In This House. Betty.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.610
Hey,There's The Door! Fine!

07:32.770 --> 07:33.900
<I>Papi! Ay!</I>

07:34.040 --> 07:36.890
Why Is Everyone In This Family So Freakin' Dramatic?

07:38.230 --> 07:40.780
<I>(Man) And Today Mayor Bloomberg Gave Posh</I>

07:40.950 --> 07:41.710
<I>The Key To The City...</I>

07:41.860 --> 07:43.910
Where Does He Get Off Calling Me A Silly Girl?

07:44.080 --> 07:46.900
Well,He Says Things. Justin,Go Watch Downstairs.

07:47.060 --> 07:49.000
Who Does He Think Has Been Holding This Family Together

07:49.140 --> 07:50.750
Ever Since Mom Died? He's Just Scared For You.

07:50.900 --> 07:53.750
He Thinks You're Doing Something That's A Little Bit Crazy. Well,You Know What,Hilda?

07:53.900 --> 07:55.970
<I>My Entire Life, I've Been The Sensible One.</I>

07:56.110 --> 07:56.810
I Never Even Thought

07:56.950 --> 07:59.260
That I Would Ever Get A Chance At Real Love.

07:59.410 --> 08:01.280
This Might Be It For Me.

08:01.430 --> 08:05.240
Don't I Deserve To Do Something A Little Crazy Just Once?

08:07.470 --> 08:09.120
<I>(Man) After Posh Rang The Opening Bell,</I>

08:09.270 --> 08:10.220
<I>The Dow Soared To New Heights...</I>

08:10.380 --> 08:13.180
<I>Ay,Betty,Please. Do You Have To Do This Now?</I>

08:13.320 --> 08:17.010
It's His Citizenship Ceremony On Saturday. Yeah,Thanks To Me.

08:17.160 --> 08:18.850
Betty,Wait. Justin--

08:18.980 --> 08:21.010
You Know What? If There Was Ever An Argument

08:21.140 --> 08:24.420
For Me To Have My Own Tv, This Would Be It.

08:25.030 --> 08:26.850
(Lowered Voice) What Do You Mean,"Thanks To You"?

08:27.010 --> 08:28.800
(Lowered Voice) How Do You Think Dad Even Got His Visa?

08:28.960 --> 08:33.320
The Lawyers? No. The I.N.S.? No. It Was Me.

08:33.470 --> 08:34.710
Wilhelmina's Father Is A Senator,

08:34.870 --> 08:37.890
And Let's Just Say, I Totally Betrayed Daniel

08:38.039 --> 08:39.909
To Get Her To Call In A Favor And Get Dad Home.

08:40.049 --> 08:42.730
You Did That? And Don't You Dare Tell Him.

08:42.890 --> 08:45.370
I Don't Want Him Knowing I Did Anything For Him.

08:47.730 --> 08:49.150
Betty!

09:25.680 --> 09:29.900
We Talked About An Amanda Doll, Maybe A Singing Career,Reb...

09:38.050 --> 09:40.910
And Then It Is All About You. Uh,Pinkie Swear.

09:41.050 --> 09:42.070
Well,It Better Be,

09:42.210 --> 09:44.680
Or I Will Twist Off Your Nipples With A Wrench.

09:44.830 --> 09:47.270
Why The Sudden Interest In My Boys?

09:48.950 --> 09:50.550
Excuse Me,Love.

09:51.170 --> 09:54.070
Can You Help A Bloke Out That's Down To His Last Floggen?

09:54.220 --> 09:57.880
Oh,My God. You Talk Just Like Someone I Know.

09:58.030 --> 10:00.800
Wait,Who Is That? (Gasps) Dot Tell Me.

10:00.960 --> 10:02.530
Don't Tell Me...

10:02.690 --> 10:04.090
Well,Wankle Me Bum.

10:04.230 --> 10:05.330
I Know,Right?

10:05.470 --> 10:08.430
And Then He Tells Me That I'm Not Allowed To See Henry

10:08.570 --> 10:10.070
As Long As I'm Living Under His Roof.

10:10.220 --> 10:13.920
So I Said,"Fine. I Won't Live Under Your Roof."

10:15.270 --> 10:17.180
(Gasps) Oh,Oh,Holy Crap!

10:17.340 --> 10:19.010
You're Telling Me. So I Was Thinking,

10:19.160 --> 10:22.230
Do You Think I Could Crash On Your Couch-- No,No,Quick,This Way.

10:22.490 --> 10:24.040
What? Where Are You Taking Me?

10:24.180 --> 10:26.660
On You Go. In. Qui,Quick. (Gasps) What--What Is--

10:26.810 --> 10:28.420
Never Mind. Ow!

10:30.690 --> 10:32.230
Hello?

10:32.580 --> 10:33.880
Oh,My Goodness, What Is This Place?

10:34.030 --> 10:35.400
It's A Sex Room.

10:35.560 --> 10:38.880
Fey Sommers Had It Built For Her Secret Trysts.

10:39.120 --> 10:40.360
Get Out Of Here.

10:41.780 --> 10:44.170
(Squeals) Shh. I Don't Want Him To Hear Us.

10:44.320 --> 10:45.660
Who? My Husband.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.490
What Husband? The One I Ran Away From In Scotland.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.030
He's Outside.

10:50.190 --> 10:53.870
<I>You Have A Secret Husband And A Secret Sex Room?</I>

10:54.020 --> 10:54.610
(Groans) Oh,My God.

10:54.760 --> 10:56.720
U Just,Like,Totally Trumped My Whole Dad Thing.

10:56.870 --> 11:00.750
Shh. I Haven't Seen Stuart For Five Years,

11:00.910 --> 11:02.400
Not Since I Told Him I Was Going To The Pet Store

11:02.560 --> 11:05.860
To Get Dog Food And I Just... Kept Going.

11:05.990 --> 11:10.090
And You Have A Dog? I Don't Even Know You.

11:11.560 --> 11:13.650
What Do You Think He Wants? I Don't Know.

11:13.780 --> 11:16.280
Maybe He Can't Find The Remote Control.

11:16.570 --> 11:18.200
Well,You Can't Just Hide In Here,Christina.

11:18.370 --> 11:20.080
He Tracked You Down.

11:20.240 --> 11:22.080
Aren't You The Least Bit Curious? (Whimpers)

11:23.280 --> 11:24.540
All Right,Everybody, Let's Give It Up.

11:24.690 --> 11:27.950
Here Comes The Bride In A Vera Wang Original.

11:28.100 --> 11:28.870
I Don't Do That.

11:29.010 --> 11:32.030
Oh,Booty Bop? Wilhelmina Get Out Here.

11:32.630 --> 11:33.750
Oh!

11:33.900 --> 11:37.050
Be Still, My Flaming Heart.

11:37.210 --> 11:38.620
Damn,I'm Good.

11:39.120 --> 11:41.480
Now,Vera,I'm Not Sure About This Train.

11:41.620 --> 11:42.450
<I>Now I Was Thinking--</I>

11:42.600 --> 11:44.950
This Is Major.

11:47.710 --> 11:49.980
(Gasps) Oh,My God, It's Perfect Spice.

11:50.140 --> 11:53.040
I Have A New Muse.

11:54.140 --> 11:55.630
Hello?

11:55.790 --> 11:56.960
Anybody?

11:57.100 --> 11:58.200
Bride Over Here.

11:58.340 --> 12:01.510
You Really Think It's Okay? Rc.

12:01.940 --> 12:02.810
Marc.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.840
It's So Beyond "Okay,"

12:05.000 --> 12:07.120
I'm Giving You A Booty Bop.

12:07.820 --> 12:09.160
Marc!

12:09.440 --> 12:10.870
I'm Sorry,Willie, But Look At Her In That Dress.

12:11.030 --> 12:13.400
She Made Me Feel Tingly Where No Girl Has Ever

12:13.540 --> 12:18.360
Made Me Feel Tingly. (Sighs) Vicki,Darling, I Have A Thought...

12:18.500 --> 12:20.780
No,Not Posh. Don't Hurt Her. Ow! Oh.

12:21.180 --> 12:23.220
You Know What,Vera? I Think We're Gonna Go

12:23.360 --> 12:25.850
In Another Direction, So You Can Leave Now.

12:34.700 --> 12:36.690
You're Not Serious? You're Right.

12:36.850 --> 12:39.590
Marc, Get Her Some Flats.

12:46.080 --> 12:47.150
Goin' On A Trip?

12:47.300 --> 12:49.100
My Father Found Out About Henry And Me.

12:49.250 --> 12:51.090
Things Got Messy, So I Moved Out.

12:51.250 --> 12:52.460
And I Know You Said From The Beginning

12:52.600 --> 12:54.180
That It Was A Mistake, But I Would Really Appreciate It

12:54.320 --> 12:59.350
If You Didn't Say, "I Told You So." Betty,Who Am I To Be Giving You Advice On Relationships?

12:59.490 --> 13:01.390
Have You Taken A Look At My Family Lately? Don't Even Talk About Family.

13:01.550 --> 13:03.270
Busting My Ass For The Last Year To Try To Make... I Mean,I Know That He's Trying To Protect Me...

13:03.410 --> 13:06.510
This Magazine Work. Does He Even Once Say,"Nice Job"? But He Can't Just Shelter Me From The Rest Of The World.

13:06.670 --> 13:08.570
He'll Always See Me As This Little Chubby Girl... I'll Always Be The Irresponsible Playboy

13:08.730 --> 13:10.480
Who Blew Through His Trust Fund In A Year. Who's Gonna Get Asthma If She Runs Too Fast.

13:10.660 --> 13:12.040
And You Know What? I Don't Care. And The Joke Is, I Still Care What He Thinks.

13:12.180 --> 13:15.210
M Not Going. What? I'm Not Going. What?

13:15.360 --> 13:20.270
I'm Not Going To His Wedding. I'm Not Going To His Citizenship Ceremony.

13:20.720 --> 13:24.510
Thank You For Listening. You,Too.

13:26.310 --> 13:26.950
Betty.

13:27.100 --> 13:27.500
Hi.

13:27.660 --> 13:30.470
Hilda Called. She Told Me What Happened.

13:30.620 --> 13:32.420
You're Not Staying With Christina.

13:32.630 --> 13:34.630
You're Staying With Me

13:37.710 --> 13:40.370
It's Been A Long Time, Christina.

13:41.710 --> 13:43.490
Oh,And No Rush Hurrying Back

13:43.640 --> 13:45.890
With That Dog Food, By The Way.

13:46.050 --> 13:48.590
Biscuit Died Three Years Ago.

13:51.400 --> 13:53.400
What Do You Want,
Stuart?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.500
I Want To Say
I'm Sorry.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.700
I Know I Wasn't A Very Good Husband,Christina

14:04.800 --> 14:07.000
And You Taking Off
Like That Was...

14:07.600 --> 14:10.100
Well, It Was The Kick
I Needed To Get Myself Some Help.

14:12.700 --> 14:14.200
But Part
Of Me Getting Better

14:14.200 --> 14:16.600
Is Making Amends
To Those I Hurt,

14:19.400 --> 14:20.400
So Here I Am.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.700
Yeah, I'm Sorry
I Ran Out On You.

14:25.500 --> 14:28.300
I Guess
It Was Just Easier To Secretly Put Money Aside
For Two Years,

14:28.300 --> 14:29.300
Hide In A Neighbor's Barn,

14:29.300 --> 14:30.800
Then Wait At The Airport
For Four Days

14:30.800 --> 14:32.400
For A Standby Ticket
To New York

14:32.400 --> 14:34.300
Than It Was To Speak
To My Husband.

14:34.800 --> 14:35.800
I Hear That.

14:41.100 --> 14:43.600
So Do You Think
We Can Ever Be Friends Again?

14:56.600 --> 14:57.600
After We Get You Unpacked,

14:57.600 --> 14:59.300
We Can Go Get
Some Chinese Food.

14:59.300 --> 15:00.900
There's This Really Great--

15:01.000 --> 15:03.200
Betty? Come In.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.000
You've Been
In My Apartment Before.

15:05.300 --> 15:06.400
Oh, Here's Your Key.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.800
Oh, Uh, I Don't Need A Key.
You Have To Have A Key.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.700
But Does This Mean--

15:10.800 --> 15:12.300
I Mean--
I Mean, What Does It Mean?

15:12.300 --> 15:13.800
It Means
You Can Open The Door.

15:14.500 --> 15:16.000
Oh, And Here...

15:16.800 --> 15:19.700
And This Empty Drawer
Means You Can Unpack.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.600
And That Glass Over There

15:21.600 --> 15:23.400
Means You Can Have
A Glass Of Water.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.900
Okay, Uh, Great.

15:26.900 --> 15:29.200
Uh, Yeah, Cool.

15:30.000 --> 15:30.700
Great.

15:30.700 --> 15:31.700
Why Are You Being
So Weird?

15:31.700 --> 15:33.200
I Don't Know, It Just--

15:33.600 --> 15:35.400
This Feels Different.

15:36.600 --> 15:38.000
I Think It Feels Nice.

15:39.100 --> 15:41.600
And, You Know, The Good Part Of All This Stuff
Going On With Your Family

15:42.100 --> 15:43.600
Is We Don't
Have To Hide Anymore.

15:44.300 --> 15:45.500
We Can Be A Real Couple.

15:46.300 --> 15:48.400
Yeah,
We Can Plan Things.

15:48.400 --> 15:49.500
Yeah, Like Christmas.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.400
Oh, Where  You Put
The Christmas Tree?

15:51.400 --> 15:54.200
Right Here.
There?

15:54.200 --> 15:55.300
Yeah.
Really?

15:55.300 --> 15:57.100
Wouldn't It Be So Much Better
Over Here On This Wall?

15:58.300 --> 15:59.800
Ah, But The Radiator's
Over There.

15:59.800 --> 16:00.800
Over Here,
It's In The Window.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.900
Everyone Can See It.
But It Blocks The Window.

16:02.900 --> 16:05.400
If It Was Here--
Yeah, You Know What?
Forget Christmas.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.300
Valentine's Day.

16:06.300 --> 16:08.300
Oh, Why Don't We Go Back To That Sushi Restaurant

16:08.300 --> 16:09.500
Where We Had Our First Date?

16:09.500 --> 16:10.600
It's A Pinkberry Now.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.300
Oh, Even Better.
I Hate Sushi.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.100
Oh, Um,
This Could Be Really Fun--

16:14.100 --> 16:16.300
I Heard Hall & Oates Are Gonna
Be In Town...

16:16.300 --> 16:17.200
 In April.

16:17.800 --> 16:18.400
Oh.

16:20.400 --> 16:21.100
What?

16:21.900 --> 16:23.700
Uh, April.

16:23.700 --> 16:26.400
Uh, Oh. Oh, God.
Uh, That's Right.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.500
That Was Stupid.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.500
Forget I Said It.
Erase Awkward Moment.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.800
Um, No, I Totally Knew That
You'd Be Back In Tucson By Then.

16:32.800 --> 16:37.000
I Just... I'm Just Gonna Go
And Unpack My Toothbrush

16:37.000 --> 16:38.200
And My Stuff In The Bathroom.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.200
Um, I'll Be Right Back.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.100
Betty, That's The Closet.

16:47.400 --> 16:50.400
Oh, Yeah, I Know.
I Just, Uh, Need A Minute.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.300
You Know, It's Bad Luck

17:16.300 --> 17:18.700
To See The Bride
On Her Wedding Day.

17:20.500 --> 17:21.900
Not For The Bodyguard.

17:22.900 --> 17:25.599
So You Think You Might
Need Some Protection On Your Honeymoon?

17:27.700 --> 17:31.200
Dwayne,
Sweet, Horny Dwayne...

17:32.100 --> 17:32.900
Beat It.

17:33.400 --> 17:36.200
Mama's Weave Can't
Get Sweaty On Her Big Day.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.200
Can I At Least
Take A Shower?

17:40.300 --> 17:41.900
(Sighs) Don't Use
The Good Shampoo.

17:45.300 --> 17:46.800
This Is Room 1220.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.500
I'd Like My Breakfast,
Please.

17:48.500 --> 17:49.700
(Woman) Yes, Ms. Slater.

17:51.900 --> 17:55.100
<I>Last Night Victoria Beckham
Set Gotham Ablaze.</I>

17:55.100 --> 17:57.000
<I>Posh Wore
Her Maid Of Honor Gown</I>

17:57.000 --> 17:58.300
<I>For A Night On The Town.</I>

17:58.600 --> 18:00.900
<I>Once Again, Vicki B.
Has Stolen The Spotlight</I>

18:00.900 --> 18:03.500
<I>From Wilhelmina,
Tigging The Queson,</I>

18:03.800 --> 18:06.000
<I>Whose Big Day Is It?</I>

18:12.000 --> 18:13.900
Okay,
Do I Wear The Flag Tie,

18:13.900 --> 18:16.000
The Flag Pin Or Bo?

18:16.800 --> 18:19.700
<I>If You Wear A Flag Tie,
I'm Leaving The Country.</I>

18:20.700 --> 18:21.600
Pin It Is.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.200
Unbelievable.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.500
One Of The Biggest Days
Of My Life,

18:24.500 --> 18:25.600
<I>And She Doesn't Even Call.

18:25.600 --> 18:26.800
Ay, Papi.</I>

18:26.800 --> 18:28.200
You Know Betty Loves You.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.300
She Doesn't Act Like It.

18:29.800 --> 18:31.700
She Lied
And Disrespected Me,

18:32.400 --> 18:34.100
And All I Wanted To Do
Was Protect Her.

18:34.100 --> 18:35.600
All She's Thinking About
Is Herself.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.100
<I>Okay, D镴Alo, D镴Alo.</I>

18:39.200 --> 18:42.700
Listen, You Have No Idea
What Betty's Done For You.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.700
Hilda, What Are You
Talking About?

18:52.400 --> 18:55.300
I Love That
You've Got A Sex Room.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.400
You've Really Made It.

18:59.200 --> 19:02.200
Well, Technically,

19:02.800 --> 19:04.100
It's Not Really Mine,

19:05.200 --> 19:07.000
But It Was Convenient,
Wasn't It?

19:08.800 --> 19:11.800
So Was It, Um,
As Good As You Remember?

19:12.700 --> 19:15.900
Well, You Didn't Pass Out
Drunk Midway Through,

19:15.900 --> 19:18.500
<I>So I Suppose
It Was A Mild Improvement.</I>

19:20.200 --> 19:21.400
I Missed You,
Christina.

19:22.500 --> 19:23.900
Didn't Think
I'd Missed You.

19:24.900 --> 19:25.900
But You Did?

19:26.900 --> 19:27.700
(Whispers) A Wee Bit.

19:33.700 --> 19:34.900
I'm Gonna Use The Loo.

19:35.900 --> 19:37.300
(Normal Voice)
Do You Know What?
What?

19:37.300 --> 19:39.800
I'd Forgotten About
Good Stuart.

19:40.700 --> 19:42.100
Oh, Good Stuart
Was Always There.

19:42.100 --> 19:45.200
He Was Just...
A Little Lost

19:45.800 --> 19:47.200
And A Lot Pissed.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.400
Well, Just You Remember--

19:50.700 --> 19:53.300
Good Stuart Remembers To Put
The Toilet Seat Down

19:53.300 --> 19:54.400
When He's Finished.

19:54.800 --> 19:55.500
Right.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.700
(Whispers)
Bad, Bad Stuart.

20:47.500 --> 20:48.900
Oh, You're Awake.

20:49.300 --> 20:50.400
Good Morning.

20:51.900 --> 20:52.900
(Muffled Voice)
I Was Gonna Sneak Out

20:52.900 --> 20:55.000
And Brush My Teeth
Before You Woke Up.

20:55.900 --> 20:58.600
What?
No, Don't Be Silly.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.600
You Should Be Comfortable
With Who You Are.

21:02.300 --> 21:05.100
So Listen, I Am Never
In Manhattan On A Saturday.

21:05.100 --> 21:05.800
Yeah?

21:06.700 --> 21:08.700
And There's That Brunch Place
On Bank Street

21:08.700 --> 21:10.500
That Has The Cute Little
Baby Ducks On The Awning,

21:10.500 --> 21:13.100
And I Have No Idea What They
Serve, But The Ducks Are Cute.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.200
(Normal Voice)
Betty, They Serve Baby Duck.

21:15.600 --> 21:16.200
What?

21:17.000 --> 21:18.100
(Laughing)
You're So Easy.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.100
Shut Up.

21:21.100 --> 21:23.100
So I Was Thinking...
Yeah.

21:23.100 --> 21:24.600
After Breakfast,

21:24.900 --> 21:28.800
You And I Could Go
On A Little Adventure.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.700
Ta-Da.
New York Transit Museum?

21:32.700 --> 21:36.300
Mm-Hmm. Well, I Know What A Fan
You Are Of The Subway System,

21:36.300 --> 21:39.100
And There Was That Freaky
Third Rail Experience You Had.

21:39.100 --> 21:40.100
Well,
My Glasses Were Foggy,

21:40.100 --> 21:43.000
But I Do Think
I Saw My Nana Down There.
Yeah, Probably.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.500
Anyway, I Thought
It Would Be Fun.

21:45.400 --> 21:46.200
Yeah.

21:46.700 --> 21:49.100
What? What--What--
What's With The Face?

21:49.100 --> 21:50.100
You Don't Wanna Go?

21:50.100 --> 21:52.000
No, No, Of Course I Do.
Who Wouldn't?

21:52.300 --> 21:53.100
It's Just...

21:53.800 --> 21:56.300
Don't You Think
You Should Go To Your Dad's
Citizenship Ceremony?

21:59.400 --> 22:01.200
No. Henry, No.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.900
I-I Made A Decision,

22:03.200 --> 22:04.700
And Today Is About Us,

22:04.700 --> 22:07.200
And I Wanna Do
Something Crazy And Fun.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.500
New York Transit Museum
It Is.

22:12.300 --> 22:15.000
<I>(Man) And We'll Be Back
With A Ticker Tape Parade...</I>

22:15.000 --> 22:16.500
<I>In Honor Of Victoria Beckham.</I>

22:22.500 --> 22:25.200
Oh, I Thought
You Were Room Service.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.500
I Want To Talk
To My Ther.

22:26.500 --> 22:28.500
Bradford's Suite
Is On The Tenth Floor.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.900
Separate Rooms The Night
Before The Wedding.

22:31.200 --> 22:33.100
You Know What
An Old-Fashioned Girl I Am.

22:33.500 --> 22:35.100
That Must Be
What He Sees In You.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.500
I Want You
To Give These To Him.

22:37.800 --> 22:39.400
I Won't Be Attending
The Wedding.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.800
Oh, What A Shame.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.500
I Guess
I'll Have To Do

22:43.500 --> 22:46.000
Our Mother-Son Dance
With Alexis.

22:50.400 --> 22:51.300
Who Is That?

22:52.800 --> 22:53.600
Posh.

22:53.600 --> 22:56.700
Spice Girl Can't Handle
Spicy Foods. Go Figure.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.500
I'll Make Sure
Bradford Gets These. Bye.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.300
(Laughs)
Come On, I-I Know
I Have That Coupon

23:23.300 --> 23:25.500
For The Transit Museum
Somewhere In My Desk.

23:25.500 --> 23:28.000
You Know, I Really Don't Mind
Paying The Extra 10 Bucks.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.700
I Know, But You Get This Free Subway Map
Shower Curtain With It,

23:30.700 --> 23:33.300
And Hilda
Could Really Use That Because She Still Has Trouble
With The "A" Line,

23:33.300 --> 23:34.600
And There's Just No Reason
For Her To End Up

23:34.600 --> 23:36.600
At The Bronx Zoo
As Often As She Does.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.300
Who's In Wilhelmina's Office?

23:48.700 --> 23:49.500
Daniel?

23:51.600 --> 23:53.300
Oh, Betty, Henry, Hi.

23:57.100 --> 23:58.900
Booze And Pills Weren't Enough?
(Needle Hits Floor)

23:59.700 --> 24:01.400
I See You've Graduated.
I Can Explain--

24:01.400 --> 24:04.200
No, Don't Bother. I Have
Had Enough Of Your Excuses.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.900
<I>I Was So Stupid
To Actually Think--</I>

24:06.900 --> 24:08.000
I'm Sick.

24:09.700 --> 24:10.700
It's My Liver.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.600
All The Drinking
Finally Did Me In.

24:17.400 --> 24:20.400
That Medication's
Just A Band-Aid.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.800
So What Exactly
Are We Talking About Here?

24:27.000 --> 24:29.600
$100,000 For
An Experimental Treatment.

24:30.900 --> 24:32.400
That's The Reason
I'm In New York.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.100
And How Are You
Gonna Get That Money?

24:38.900 --> 24:39.700
I'm Not.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.800
Good News Is
That In Six Months Time,

24:42.800 --> 24:45.000
You Will Be Inheriting
My Mom's Spoon Collection.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.100
Oh, Stuart.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.800
I Have Always Wanted
That Spoon Collection...

24:55.300 --> 24:56.600
Just Not Like This.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.700
Stay In New York.

25:03.400 --> 25:04.100
Why?

25:04.100 --> 25:05.200
I Don't Know How,

25:05.300 --> 25:09.000
But I'm--I'm Gonna
Get You The Money, Okay?

25:11.100 --> 25:11.700
(Whispers) Yeah.

25:46.500 --> 25:48.500
And Then I See Her Bodyguard
Leaving Her Room.

25:48.500 --> 25:50.000
What Else Could It Be,
Right?

25:50.400 --> 25:52.700
Um, Yeah, I Mean,
That Sounds Suspicious.

25:52.700 --> 25:55.300
Did You Hear Anyone Say Anything
At All?

25:55.300 --> 25:57.600
Do You Know If--
No, No I Don't.

25:57.600 --> 25:58.900
I Don't Know Anythg.

25:58.900 --> 26:01.100
But, Daniel, If--If You Think
That This Is True,

26:01.100 --> 26:02.700
Then You Should Go
To Your Father And Tell Him

26:02.700 --> 26:04.000
Before He Marries That Woman.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.800
He Knows How I Feel
About Wilhelmina.

26:05.800 --> 26:07.900
I Can't Go To Him
Without Any Proof.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.300
I Just Wish There Was ???

26:10.300 --> 26:11.900
Ah, Don't Worry About It, Betty.

26:11.900 --> 26:13.200
It's Not Your Problem.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.700
Although, I Think I Am
Gonna Go To His Wedding.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.800
Maybe I Can Get Something
Out Of The Bodyguard.

26:17.800 --> 26:19.100
Good Idea. Yeah.

26:19.100 --> 26:21.500
Because That Guy
Seems Like A Big Dummy.

26:21.500 --> 26:24.100
<I>The Other Day He Said Something
Was A Mute Point. (Scoffs)</I>

26:25.400 --> 26:26.300
That Was Me.

26:27.500 --> 26:30.900
"Moot," "Mute"--
I Get It Now.

26:30.900 --> 26:32.900
Oh...
Well, He's Dumb, Too.

26:35.200 --> 26:36.600
I'm Not Making This Better.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.100
Hi, I'm Amanda Sommers.

26:48.100 --> 26:49.700
I'm Fey Sommers' Daughter.

26:50.200 --> 26:52.000
Oh, Hi There. Hello.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.200
I'm Amanda Sommers.

26:53.200 --> 26:55.100
I Am Fey Sommers' Daughter.

26:56.000 --> 26:56.900
Oh, Hi. 

26:56.900 --> 26:59.000
(Lowered Voice)
Being A Celebrity Is So Hard.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.400
Everyone Just Wants
A Piece Of You.

27:00.400 --> 27:03.000
Yeah, How About That?
Hey, Have You Seen Cliff Yet?

27:03.000 --> 27:03.900
(Normal Voice)
Don't Worry.

27:04.200 --> 27:06.200
Your Wide Load Lover Will Be
Here Any Minute.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.500
(Groans) Amanda, No Jokes.
I'm Freaking Out.

27:08.500 --> 27:09.900
I'm Debuting Him Today
As My Boyfriend,

27:09.900 --> 27:12.000
And I Have No Idea What's
Gonna Walk Though That Door.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.900
Sweetie, Relax.

27:13.900 --> 27:15.600
He Can't Fit
Through Those Doors.

27:15.600 --> 27:16.500
Stop It.

27:21.300 --> 27:23.200
Trans-Fatty...

27:23.800 --> 27:25.400
More Than Meets The Eye.

27:26.200 --> 27:28.900
Aw, Look At My Boyfriend.

27:29.700 --> 27:32.400
Who Knew
There Were Hardwood Floors Under That Shag Rug?

27:32.400 --> 27:34.000
Hardwood Floors!

27:35.000 --> 27:35.900
(Chuckles)
That's My Boyfriend.

27:35.900 --> 27:38.500
That's My Boyfriend.
Hardwood Floors.

27:41.100 --> 27:41.700
So... (Chuckles)

27:43.300 --> 27:44.300
What Do You Think?

27:44.300 --> 27:45.900
I Can't Believe
You Did This.

27:45.900 --> 27:48.800
I Knew What A Big Deal It Was
To You, Meeting Your Friends.

27:49.300 --> 27:50.600
I Didn't Want To Be A Jerk.

27:52.100 --> 27:53.500
(Chuckles)
So How Does It Feel?

27:53.500 --> 27:55.500
I'm Sweating,
My Collar's Too Tight...

27:55.500 --> 27:57.200
(Clenched Teeth)
And These Shoes Really Hurt.

27:57.200 --> 27:58.600
Beauty Is Pain, Cliff...

27:59.200 --> 28:01.600
And You Are Hurting Me Bad.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.200
Betty, We Can Go To The Transit Museum
Another Time.

28:08.500 --> 28:10.800
Today You're Going To Your Father's
Citizenship Ceremony.

28:13.700 --> 28:14.400
Betty.

28:14.400 --> 28:15.700
I Already Told You
That I Didn't Want

28:15.700 --> 28:17.100
To Be Anywhere
Near Here, Henry.

28:17.100 --> 28:18.100
Why Would You Do This?

28:18.100 --> 28:20.100
Because You're Pretending You Can Live
Without Your Family, Betty,

28:20.100 --> 28:22.000
But It's Just An Act. I've Seen You Guys Together.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
You're Like This... And When I Leave,

28:24.100 --> 28:26.000
They're Gonna Be The Ones
Who Are Here For You.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.500
<I>Rich Old Guy. Hot!</I>

28:44.800 --> 28:46.000
Okay, This Is Weird,

28:46.300 --> 28:47.900
But Has Cliff
Been Talking To That Guy

28:47.900 --> 28:49.500
For Kind Of A Long Time?

28:50.000 --> 28:53.400
Is He Sucking On That Lamb Chop
A Little... Seductively?

28:53.400 --> 28:55.900
Seductively
Or Disgustingly?

28:56.300 --> 28:58.000
Hey. Hi. Come Here.

29:01.200 --> 29:04.100
Oh, He Did Not Just Give Me
The "One Minute" Finger.

29:04.100 --> 29:07.000
<I>Ooh, Denied.</I>

29:10.700 --> 29:12.800
(All)
I Hereby Declare An Oath

29:12.800 --> 29:15.000
That I Absolutely And Entirely

29:15.000 --> 29:16.800
Renounce And Abjure

29:17.300 --> 29:19.600
All Allegiance And Fidelity

29:19.700 --> 29:23.400
To Any Foreign Prince,
State Or Sovereignty,

29:23.400 --> 29:26.300
Of Whom Or Which
I Have Heretofore

29:26.300 --> 29:28.400
Been A Subject Or Citizen...

29:28.400 --> 29:30.300
Gwyneth's Wearing White
To The Wedding?

29:30.400 --> 29:32.000
<I>That Is Such A Bitch Slap.</I>

29:33.500 --> 29:37.500
That I Will Support And Defend
The Constitution And Laws

29:38.200 --> 29:40.300
Of The United States
Of America

29:40.900 --> 29:43.900
Against All Enemies,
Foreign And Domestic,

29:43.900 --> 29:47.600
That I Will Bear True Faith
And Allegiance To The Same.

29:53.900 --> 29:54.500
Hello.

29:54.500 --> 29:55.600
Oh, Hey, Marc,
This Is Tony.

29:55.600 --> 29:56.400
Don't Care.

29:58.600 --> 30:00.200
That Was Rude.
So Is Tramping It Up

30:00.200 --> 30:02.000
With That "Hot Ten Years Ago"
Cater Waiter

30:02.000 --> 30:03.500
<I>With Clearly Waxed Eyebrows.

30:03.500 --> 30:06.200
I Knew They Were Waxed.
He Swears That He Was Born</I>

30:06.200 --> 30:07.600
With The Perfect
Joan Crawford Arch.

30:07.600 --> 30:08.900
Oh, Please, Not Even Joan--

30:08.900 --> 30:11.300
Wait A Minute.
I'm Angry!
About What?

30:12.900 --> 30:15.500
Tony's A Model I've Worked With.
We're Just Friends.

30:15.500 --> 30:16.800
Oh, Please. We're Gay.

30:16.800 --> 30:18.500
There's No Such Thing
As Just Friends.

30:18.500 --> 30:19.500
(Laughs) He's Straight.

30:19.500 --> 30:20.900
Uh, Uh, A Straight Model.

30:20.900 --> 30:23.000
Well, I Guess
The World Is Upside Down.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.200
What Is Wrong With You?

30:24.200 --> 30:25.200
???

30:25.200 --> 30:28.600
A Baby Abandoned
In A Dumpster While Mommy Explores
Her Newfound Hotness.

30:28.600 --> 30:29.700
Well, I've Had It.
Can We--

30:29.700 --> 30:30.800
<I>No M酳.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.200
This Thing
Between Us Is Over.</I>

30:35.200 --> 30:36.100
(Man) Say "Cheese."

30:36.100 --> 30:36.800
Hi.
(Laughs)

30:39.500 --> 30:40.300
Can...

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
So, D-Dawg, What's Up?

30:53.000 --> 30:55.300
It's Daniel Meade.
We Met.

30:55.300 --> 30:58.600
Bodyguard, Huh? That's
An Interesting Line Of Work.

30:58.600 --> 30:59.700
You Must Get
A Lot Of Action.

30:59.700 --> 31:02.500
Big, Strong, Good-Looking Guy
Like You...

31:02.600 --> 31:04.900
You Hittin' On Me?
No. No, No, No.

31:04.900 --> 31:07.500
No. No, This Is About
You And Wilhelmina.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.300
I Just Need
A Few Answers.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.600
I've Got A Blank Check
For Some Information About...

31:13.300 --> 31:16.200
My Checkbook.
Oh, Damn It.

31:16.600 --> 31:19.100
I Left It On The Dresser.
I Could See It Right There.

31:19.500 --> 31:21.300
Well, Well, Well.

31:21.300 --> 31:23.200
I Thought I Heard
A Meeting Of The Minds.

31:23.200 --> 31:24.600
Game Over, Wilhelmina.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.800
Dwayne Just Told Me
Everything Aut You Two.

31:28.100 --> 31:29.700
Mm, Nice Try, Daniel.

31:29.700 --> 31:31.700
There's Nothing Going On
Between Dwayne And I.

31:31.700 --> 31:35.000
<I>But For Argument's Sake,
Let's Say I Was Enjoying</I>

31:35.000 --> 31:38.800
The Pleasure Of This Tall Glass
Of Chocolate Milk.

31:38.800 --> 31:40.700
I Would Think You'd Run
Straight To Your Father,

31:40.700 --> 31:43.100
But Oh, Wait, You Can't,

31:43.100 --> 31:44.700
And Do You Know Why You Can't?

31:44.700 --> 31:46.700
He Has No Proof.
Dwayne.

31:46.700 --> 31:48.700
I Was Building Up To That.

31:49.500 --> 31:52.700
But He's Right.
You Have No Oof.

31:53.800 --> 31:56.100
I Will See You
At The Altar.

32:06.700 --> 32:08.000
Can You Believe Him?

32:08.600 --> 32:10.200
Suddenly He's The Hottest Guy
In The Room,

32:10.200 --> 32:11.000
And... (Scoffs)

32:11.500 --> 32:12.600
I'm Not Good Enough.

32:12.600 --> 32:14.200
Marc, I Got To Be Honest
With You.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.600
I Do Like His New Suit.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.900
But Seriously,
He's Only 15% Hotter.

32:17.900 --> 32:21.500
Oh, Really? Then Why Is
Every Waiter Serving Him Food?

32:21.900 --> 32:24.400
Why Is Every Bartender
Pouring Him Drinks?

32:24.400 --> 32:26.500
Oh, My God,
It's Happened.

32:26.500 --> 32:27.700
You're Looking Past
The Outside

32:27.700 --> 32:29.600
<I>And Seeing
What's On The Inside.</I>

32:29.700 --> 32:30.800
You're Falling For Him.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.300
You're Falling
For An Average Man.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.800
Oh, God. I Am.

32:36.500 --> 32:38.000
I'm An Average-Man Lover.

32:39.500 --> 32:40.500
What Do I Do?

32:41.100 --> 32:42.200
You Accept It.

32:42.500 --> 32:44.600
You Are Deeper
Than You Think.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.200
It's Okay.
We All Have Flaws.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.000
But I-I Broke Up With Him.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.100
Then You Get Out There,

32:52.100 --> 32:53.600
And You Do
Something Amatic

32:53.600 --> 32:55.500
To Show That Fatty
How Much You Care.

32:55.900 --> 32:57.300
Like, You Run
Through The Airport,

32:57.300 --> 32:58.700
And You
Bust Through Security,

32:58.700 --> 33:00.600
And Just As The Doors
Of The Plane Are Closing,

33:00.600 --> 33:04.700
You Scream At The Top
Of Your Lungs, "Cliff!"

33:04.700 --> 33:05.600
You Calling Me?

33:08.000 --> 33:09.800
Or You Just Go Over There
And Talk To Him.

33:25.800 --> 33:27.700
(Sighs) I'm Sorry
I Said Those Things.

33:27.700 --> 33:30.300
And I'm Sorry That I Didn't
Tell You About Me And Henry.

33:30.300 --> 33:33.200
It's Just...
Dad, You're Right.

33:33.200 --> 33:35.100
I'm Doing Something
Really Stupid.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.800
And You're Gonna
Keep Doing It, Right?

33:39.900 --> 33:40.600
Yeah.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.400
And When He Leaves,
I'm Gonna Fall Apart.

33:44.400 --> 33:47.100
And I Want You To Promise Me
You'll Be Here To Pick Me Up.

33:47.400 --> 33:48.700
I'm Your Father.

33:49.500 --> 33:50.900
Where Else Am I Gonna Be?

33:56.700 --> 33:58.200
You're Still Crying?

33:58.600 --> 34:00.500
Yeah, First He Became
A Citizen,

34:00.500 --> 34:03.300
And Now Betty...

34:04.200 --> 34:05.500
Just Watch Your Tv.

34:08.199 --> 34:12.000
So This Does Mean
You're Coming Back Home, Right?

34:12.300 --> 34:12.900
Yes.

34:12.900 --> 34:16.000
Hilda Told Me What You Did
To Make This Happen.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.800
Hilda Sucks At Secrets.

34:17.800 --> 34:19.699
Daniel's Done So Much
For You, Betty.

34:20.500 --> 34:22.100
You Can't Betray
A Friend For Me.

34:22.600 --> 34:24.699
Dad, If I Tell Daniel
About Wilhelmina,

34:24.699 --> 34:27.300
She'll Try And Do Something
To Mess Up Your Citizenship.

34:27.300 --> 34:28.500
I'm An American Now.

34:30.100 --> 34:31.100
Let Her Try.

34:33.300 --> 34:35.699
All Right, People.
Let's Get This Over With.

34:35.800 --> 34:37.900
I Mean,
Let's Get Me Married Off

34:37.900 --> 34:40.199
To The Most Wonderful Man
In The Whole World.

34:40.199 --> 34:42.500
Actually, Ms. Slater,
There's Just One Problem.

34:42.600 --> 34:43.800
Your Maid Of Honor...

34:44.100 --> 34:45.600
We Can't
Find Her Anywhere.

34:45.699 --> 34:48.300
Oh, Posh Flaked?

34:48.600 --> 34:49.600
Oh, Darn.

34:49.600 --> 34:51.600
Well, I Guess We'll Have
To Go Ahead Without Her.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.500
Poor Thing,
I Hope She's All Right.

34:55.500 --> 34:57.800
All Right, People.
Focus On The Joy.

34:58.100 --> 34:59.000
Flowers!

35:01.300 --> 35:02.300
Hello

35:04.200 --> 35:06.000
Anybody Out There?

35:07.900 --> 35:09.900
I Think The Door's Locked!

35:12.100 --> 35:13.700
This Really Is Major.

35:55.900 --> 35:57.400
Dear Friends,

35:58.200 --> 36:00.200
We Are Gathered Here Today

36:00.200 --> 36:02.600
To Join In Holy Matrimony

36:02.600 --> 36:06.400
Wilhelmina Slater
And Bradford Meade.

36:07.500 --> 36:08.500
I Object!
(Gsts Gasp)

36:13.600 --> 36:15.300
We Haven't Gotten
To That Part Yet.

36:17.700 --> 36:18.300
Oh.

36:20.800 --> 36:21.800
Oh, I Knew It.

36:21.800 --> 36:24.000
I Knew Wilhelmina
Was Sleeping With Her Bodyguard.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.100
When Did You Find Out?

36:25.100 --> 36:27.300
Daniel, It's Not Really
Important. Just Go In There

36:27.300 --> 36:29.400
And Talk To Your Father
And Stop The Wedding!

36:29.400 --> 36:30.400
No, No, No,???

36:30.400 --> 36:31.700
I Mean,
You're My Only Proof.

36:31.700 --> 36:34.200
So Did You Find Out On Your Own?
Did Someone Tell You?

36:35.400 --> 36:36.400
I Saw Them.

36:36.800 --> 36:38.500
Wait, What? When?

36:38.900 --> 36:39.500
Um,

36:41.000 --> 36:44.500
Four Months Ago When I Went
To Wilhelmina's Apartment To Get The Book.

36:44.500 --> 36:46.700
Four Months Ago And You Waited
Till Now To Tell Me?

36:46.700 --> 36:48.200
No, Daniel, It's Not
What It Sounds Like.

36:48.200 --> 36:49.300
It's Very Complicated--

36:49.300 --> 36:51.500
No. It's Not Complicated.

36:51.800 --> 36:53.100
Betty, You Kw I've Been
Trying To Find A Way

36:53.100 --> 36:54.800
To Open My Father's Eyes
About This Woman.

36:54.800 --> 36:56.000
But She Was Using Me--

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
I Don't Want To Hear
Your Excuses.

36:59.100 --> 37:00.300
Betty,
You're The One Person

37:00.300 --> 37:02.700
I Always Counted On Being
On My Side,

37:03.200 --> 37:04.400
And You Betrayed Me.

37:04.700 --> 37:05.800
For Wilhelmina?

37:07.000 --> 37:08.400
How Could I Ever
Trust You Again?

37:08.400 --> 37:10.500
Daniel, Please--
Just Stop.

37:12.500 --> 37:13.700
I Can't Even Look
At You.

37:20.500 --> 37:21.400
You're Fired.

37:28.700 --> 37:31.500
Do You,
Bradford Emerson Meade,

37:31.500 --> 37:34.300
Take This Woman,
Wilhelmina--

37:36.400 --> 37:39.500
Sorry. Do You--
Do You Need Something?

37:39.500 --> 37:41.000
I Really Need
To Speak With You.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.800
Yes, Just As Soon As He Takes Me
As His Lawfully Wedded Wife.

37:46.100 --> 37:47.100
Let's Go, Bradford.

37:47.100 --> 37:49.100
Really, Dad. It's Important.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.100
Just Give Me A Moment.

37:55.100 --> 37:56.100
Well,
I'll Just Go Ahead

37:56.100 --> 37:58.000
And Do My Part
While You're Gone.

37:59.200 --> 38:00.000
I Do.

38:00.400 --> 38:02.100
Oh, No. I-I'm Sorry.

38:02.100 --> 38:04.400
It Really Doesn't Work
That Way.

38:09.800 --> 38:11.000
(Whispers) Do Something.

38:13.200 --> 38:15.100
(Normal Voice)
Um, Ladies And Gentlemen,

38:15.400 --> 38:17.800
While We Wait
For The Ceremony To Resume,

38:18.400 --> 38:21.100
Perhaps A Song
From Our Own Amanda Sommers,

38:21.100 --> 38:24.900
Daughter Of The Late,
Great Fey Sommers.
(Amanda Whispers) What?

38:25.200 --> 38:26.500
(Lowered Voice)
Your 15 Minutes Are Almost Up.

38:26.500 --> 38:27.600
Quincy Jones
Is In The Fourth Row.

38:27.600 --> 38:28.900
Now Sing, Bitch.

38:41.100 --> 38:42.500
Why ??

38:43.200 --> 38:44.300
My...

38:45.000 --> 38:47.300
???

38:47.300 --> 38:50.200
And ?

38:50.200 --> 38:51.300
U ???

38:51.300 --> 38:53.300
To Try To Poison
This Relationship, Wouldn't You?

38:53.300 --> 38:55.900
I've Got To Admit,
I Admire Your Tenacity.

38:55.900 --> 38:57.100
Look, I Am Not
Making This Up.

38:57.100 --> 38:58.700
Betty Saw Them Together!

38:58.700 --> 38:59.500
Oh, Really?

38:59.500 --> 39:01.800
Then How Come Betty's Not
Here Telling Me This?

39:01.800 --> 39:04.900
She... She's Gone.

39:04.900 --> 39:07.000
How Convenient.
You're Unbelievable.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.800
I Am The Only One
Willing To Be Honest With You.

39:09.800 --> 39:11.800
Will You At Least Consider
The Possibility--

39:11.800 --> 39:13.400
I Am Not Gonna
Throw Away Something

39:13.400 --> 39:17.300
Based On Some Crazy Accusation
Made By Some Assistant.

39:18.000 --> 39:18.900
Look At You.

39:19.500 --> 39:21.000
You're Sweating, Dad.

39:21.400 --> 39:25.500
<I>Maybe It's Because Deep Inside,
You Know This Is Wrong.</I>

39:25.500 --> 39:27.600
I'm Sweating
Because You Are Driving

39:27.600 --> 39:29.300
My Blood Pressure Up
By The Minute.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.500
That Woman
Doesn't Love You At All!

39:31.500 --> 39:32.900
Get Out Of My Way.

40:01.400 --> 40:02.700
Everything All Right?

40:02.700 --> 40:04.600
Yeah, Fine.
Please, Continue.

40:06.300 --> 40:08.600
(Man Clears Throat) Do You,
Bradford Emerson Meade,

40:08.600 --> 40:12.100
Take This Woman,
Wilhelmina Vivian Slater...

40:12.100 --> 40:14.800
(Voice Distorts)
As Your Lawful Wedded Wife

40:14.800 --> 40:16.500
To Have And To Hold

40:16.500 --> 40:18.500
From This Day Forward

40:18.500 --> 40:21.100
In Sickness And In Health

40:21.100 --> 40:23.100
For Richer Or For Poorer...

40:23.500 --> 40:25.500
In Good Times And In Bad...

40:25.500 --> 40:27.900
For As Long
As You Both Shall Live?

40:35.100 --> 40:36.400
Oh, My God! Dad!

40:36.400 --> 40:37.300
(Wilhelmina) Bradford!

40:38.100 --> 40:39.700
Someone Call 9-1-1.

40:41.200 --> 40:42.100
(Daniel) Come On, Dad.

40:44.300 --> 40:46.300
Don't You Die!

40:46.600 --> 40:49.800
Don't You Dare Die!

40:49.800 --> 40:50.600
Wilhelmina!

40:51.700 --> 40:54.900
Come On, Dad, Breathe.

40:56.800 --> 40:58.500
One One Thousand.
Two One Thousand.

40:58.500 --> 41:00.000
Three One Thousand.
Four One Thousand.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.200
Five One Thousand.
Come On, Dad.
