WEBVTT

00:58.826 --> 01:01.018
So you're a singer?

01:01.087 --> 01:02.358
Yep.

01:02.426 --> 01:07.198
'Cause I don't know
who you are.

01:07.267 --> 01:12.303
That's okay, you know,
I'm not for everybody.

01:12.372 --> 01:14.964
No, I mean
I drive a lot of famous people,

01:15.032 --> 01:18.335
and I just, I never
heard of you before.

01:33.060 --> 01:35.489
Hey, I called my
boy, he's in a band,

01:35.558 --> 01:39.389
he says he's never
heard of you either.

01:39.458 --> 01:41.162
Can you talk to him?

01:41.231 --> 01:42.666
He's on the phone right now?

01:42.735 --> 01:44.059
Yeah.

01:45.197 --> 01:47.030
Hi.

01:47.098 --> 01:48.669
Hi.
This is so embarrassing,

01:48.738 --> 01:51.210
I'm sorry about my dad.
He says you're famous?

01:51.278 --> 01:53.372
I've never heard of you.
What's your name?

01:53.441 --> 01:55.374
Well, my name is Annie Clark,

01:55.443 --> 01:58.039
but I perform as St. Vincent.

01:58.108 --> 02:00.076
Maybe that's where
the confusion lies.

02:00.145 --> 02:03.347
Maybe
sing one of your songs,

02:03.416 --> 02:04.385
I don't know.

02:04.454 --> 02:06.225
Oh,
now there's a good idea.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.219
How about if you do one
for us there, Ms. Vincent?

02:08.288 --> 02:09.788
Or Mrs. Vincent?

02:15.468 --> 02:19.765
without you, love

02:19.834 --> 02:23.208
to be solo

02:23.277 --> 02:29.005
from First Avenue

02:29.073 --> 02:31.249
motherfucker in this--

02:31.318 --> 02:33.280
Whoa, did she just say MF?

02:33.349 --> 02:35.686
Yeah, goodbye, son.

02:35.755 --> 02:36.848
Motherfucker.

02:38.357 --> 02:43.287
Don't worry,
we'll find out who you are.

03:38.509 --> 03:39.548
Hello?

03:41.820 --> 03:42.848
Hello?

04:01.202 --> 04:02.241
Hello?

04:21.260 --> 04:23.988
Why was the movie
never completed?

04:26.625 --> 04:28.323
All I can say is that

04:28.392 --> 04:32.733
somewhere along the way
things went terribly wrong.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.272
give me the answer

05:17.341 --> 05:20.616
I need an answer

05:20.684 --> 05:24.280
with the goners

05:24.348 --> 05:29.284
give me the answer

06:15.703 --> 06:17.240
Should I look into the lens?

06:17.309 --> 06:19.741
Uh, I don't think so.

06:24.676 --> 06:25.980
You get it?

06:26.049 --> 06:26.909
Yep.

06:26.978 --> 06:27.577
All right, day one, so exciting.

06:27.646 --> 06:29.680
Yay.

06:29.749 --> 06:30.583
Let's roll on everything.

06:30.652 --> 06:32.448
Oh my gosh, great to see you.

06:32.517 --> 06:33.557
Hey.

06:35.762 --> 06:37.693
CB.

06:37.761 --> 06:39.294
I'm so glad you're
doing this, thank you.

06:39.363 --> 06:40.499
No, thanks for having me.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.764
I mean I think we're gonna
get really great stuff,

06:42.832 --> 06:44.693
and the fans will be
very, very excited.

06:44.761 --> 06:46.097
I hope so.

06:46.166 --> 06:47.635
And of course you'll
make me look amazing.

06:47.704 --> 06:48.763
Oh, you
wanna look amazing?

06:48.832 --> 06:50.233
Yeah.

06:51.543 --> 06:54.176
So how should--
like, what should I do?

06:54.245 --> 06:55.670
Just be yourself.

06:55.739 --> 06:56.976
Okay.

06:57.045 --> 06:58.609
Even if that's just me
playing video games?

06:58.678 --> 07:01.509
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:01.578 --> 07:03.121
I just, audience should
feel like a fly on the wall.

07:03.190 --> 07:05.015
So we're gonna film everything,

07:05.084 --> 07:07.518
especially
if it's you being you.

07:10.723 --> 07:13.497
Tour is boring.

07:13.566 --> 07:17.260
Yeah, I mean maybe
it's good to show that.

07:22.568 --> 07:24.166
Oh, shit.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.401
Ooh, oh that's a faster swim.

07:31.650 --> 07:34.409
Okay, let's start
at the beginning.

07:37.118 --> 07:40.523
It was supposed to be
a music documentary,

07:40.592 --> 07:43.495
concert footage,
interviews, you know,

07:45.127 --> 07:48.962
I guess I just wanted people
to know who I really am.

07:53.067 --> 07:56.272
Yeah. How do I do this?

07:56.340 --> 07:58.334
You're doing it right.

08:00.009 --> 08:01.872
But I didn't--
I didn't want the film

08:01.941 --> 08:03.944
to just be random footage.

08:07.446 --> 08:10.819
I wanted it to be
intimate and... revealing.

08:13.082 --> 08:14.691
Here we go.

08:16.625 --> 08:17.860
You know, it's a lot.

08:17.929 --> 08:19.025
It takes a lot of
energy to do the show,

08:19.094 --> 08:21.592
and basically
everything I do in a day

08:21.660 --> 08:25.867
is geared toward that hour
and a half I have on stage.

08:37.643 --> 08:42.654
I was excited to have somebody
make a movie about me.

08:42.723 --> 08:45.622
I mean, I wanted to
know what we'd find

08:45.691 --> 08:48.620
once we stripped
away those layers.

08:48.688 --> 08:54.622
And when you have a friend at
the helm, you feel protected.

08:54.691 --> 08:58.031
So, I asked my best
friend to direct it.

09:02.669 --> 09:08.603
There's nobody who knows me
better than Carrie Brownstein.

09:08.672 --> 09:11.816
She's a musician,
a writer, a filmmaker,

09:11.885 --> 09:15.918
she's helped me on countless
creative endeavors.

09:15.987 --> 09:20.858
And I wanted somebody I
could trust to tell my story.

09:20.927 --> 09:23.652
She understands what it's
like to be a performer,

09:23.721 --> 09:26.659
but, I mean, more than that,
she understands me.

09:26.728 --> 09:31.526
in the city who can stand me

09:37.744 --> 09:40.874
I feel like for a while,
maybe it was now,

09:40.943 --> 09:42.805
I think I'm just
second guessing,

09:42.873 --> 09:46.674
like... maybe everything was
luck before and not skill,

09:46.743 --> 09:49.346
'cause I just, I'm just
in an era of failure.

09:49.414 --> 09:51.385
Like, this is my era
of failure.

09:51.453 --> 09:54.891
You're not a failure
in any way, shape or form.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.690
But I mean,
by one litmus test,

09:56.759 --> 09:58.993
I mean, I don't, you know.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.557
No way. Bee sting.

10:03.764 --> 10:04.697
That's crazy.

10:04.766 --> 10:05.830
It's not crazy.

10:05.899 --> 10:07.364
It's totally crazy.

10:07.432 --> 10:10.302
I think it's me
using rational thought.

10:10.370 --> 10:11.637
Your pilot
was so good, though,

10:11.705 --> 10:13.039
it made me cry.

10:13.108 --> 10:15.078
I know,
but we're friends.

10:15.147 --> 10:17.807
I think other people would have
liked it if they'd seen it.

10:17.876 --> 10:19.912
I bet it would have made other
people cry too, not just me.

10:19.981 --> 10:21.979
You know what was the problem?

10:22.048 --> 10:22.978
It was supposed to be a comedy.

10:38.003 --> 10:42.597
go somewhere else

10:46.807 --> 10:48.838
C-cam, this is great.

10:48.907 --> 10:50.339
Hold there.

10:50.408 --> 10:53.382
Copy that, got it.

11:08.161 --> 11:10.530
-You're amazing.

11:12.832 --> 11:13.903
I love you.

11:15.873 --> 11:18.074
Good night, love you.
Good night.

11:18.143 --> 11:19.205
Be safe.

11:27.718 --> 11:30.253
You want some tea or anything?

11:30.321 --> 11:31.349
I'm okay.

11:32.690 --> 11:33.921
Where's the rest of the band?

11:33.989 --> 11:35.617
Everyone's already
in their bunks,

11:35.685 --> 11:39.787
or they're watching
a movie in the back.

11:39.856 --> 11:42.463
I was hoping to get a
little after show footage.

11:42.532 --> 11:43.761
Uh...

11:43.830 --> 11:45.636
Y'all just did.

11:45.704 --> 11:48.366
I got a double,
double word score.

11:50.067 --> 11:50.768
Nice.

11:50.837 --> 11:51.906
Damn it.

11:51.974 --> 11:52.839
Mm-hmm,
read 'em and weep.

11:52.908 --> 11:54.802
You what would could be fun,

11:54.871 --> 11:57.773
we could, uh, throw a little
dance party on the bus.

11:57.842 --> 11:58.882
Totally.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.142
We've never done that,

12:01.211 --> 12:02.677
but I love the idea.

12:07.554 --> 12:12.096
Hey, Annie, how did you
feel about the show tonight?

12:12.165 --> 12:13.732
Uh...

12:16.028 --> 12:17.736
Can we do this tomorrow?

12:19.069 --> 12:20.804
I'm sorry, I'm just
a little bit fried,

12:20.873 --> 12:24.108
and I kind of wanna
turn my brain off.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.643
Okay.

12:25.712 --> 12:27.535
Ketchup
spelled C-a-t-c-h-e-t?

12:27.604 --> 12:28.774
It's a British
condiment.

12:28.843 --> 12:30.443
God damn it.

12:30.512 --> 12:32.813
What is something interesting
about Annie?

12:32.882 --> 12:35.083
She's good at writing music.

12:36.080 --> 12:37.853
I don't know.

12:37.921 --> 12:39.055
Do you think she's
not interesting?

12:39.124 --> 12:41.852
What do you and
Annie like to do on the bus?

12:41.921 --> 12:43.091
Oh the bus?

12:44.289 --> 12:46.721
Oh we snack on some radishes.

12:48.132 --> 12:50.968
Something that tastes like
dirt, we really like it.

12:51.036 --> 12:55.740
So, yeah, we go look for
farmer's market every town

12:55.809 --> 12:58.866
and try, you know,
different radishes.

12:58.935 --> 13:01.069
So, Robert, what is
interesting about Annie?

13:01.137 --> 13:02.572
Her music.

13:02.641 --> 13:05.410
Neil
already said that.
- Um...

13:08.751 --> 13:10.987
Her dad is in jail.

13:11.056 --> 13:14.722
Okay, cut, I don't
think we should go there.

13:14.790 --> 13:16.994
Okay. Not interesting?

13:17.063 --> 13:18.856
Well, you know, I don't
wanna exploit her family drama

13:18.925 --> 13:20.764
for the movie.

13:20.832 --> 13:23.593
She's my friend,
I'm just gonna...

13:25.104 --> 13:30.274
Let's get you telling us
something interesting about her.

13:30.342 --> 13:32.001
Her music.

13:44.954 --> 13:45.883
That's pretty, Annie.

13:45.951 --> 13:46.883
Is it new?

13:46.952 --> 13:48.189
Yeah.

13:48.258 --> 13:49.960
It's all right, I'm
kind of working on it.

13:50.029 --> 13:53.898
It's been hard to come
up with anything lately.

14:00.169 --> 14:02.803
You can write a
song for the movie.

14:02.872 --> 14:04.738
We can track its progress.

14:04.807 --> 14:07.072
It'd make a nice story.

14:07.141 --> 14:09.639
And we kind of need a story.

14:13.644 --> 14:16.210
Only if you play
a guitar solo on it.

14:16.279 --> 14:16.949
Sure.

14:19.717 --> 14:21.056
It sounds like you
already wrote one.

14:21.125 --> 14:22.084
,
it goes like that.

14:29.130 --> 14:31.101
Hey, how's the film coming?

14:31.170 --> 14:34.129
Documentary, that's a
big step up for you.

14:34.198 --> 14:35.134
Yeah, I hope so.

14:35.202 --> 14:36.633
You know when I tell friends

14:36.701 --> 14:38.168
that you're working
in film now,

14:38.237 --> 14:40.241
they are very impressed.

14:41.706 --> 14:44.077
Yeah, I just,
I want it to be good.

14:44.145 --> 14:45.144
CB, I'm
starting on abs.

14:45.212 --> 14:48.782
Yeah, we filmed
those yesterday,

14:48.851 --> 14:50.119
and the day before.

14:51.924 --> 14:53.622
When's your next
radiation treatment?

14:53.690 --> 14:55.450
Um, Tuesday.

14:55.519 --> 14:56.694
But don't worry about me.

14:56.762 --> 14:58.992
Let's talk about this movie.

14:59.061 --> 15:00.756
I'm so proud of you, Care.

15:00.825 --> 15:03.858
Must be exciting
directing your friend.

15:09.269 --> 15:11.866
Yeah, it's really exciting.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.209
Okay, right there.

15:21.278 --> 15:22.210
I love that.

15:22.279 --> 15:23.178
So St. Vincent.

15:23.247 --> 15:24.478
So intense.

15:24.547 --> 15:25.779
I just want a little more

15:25.848 --> 15:27.317
of that in the
non-concert footage.

15:27.386 --> 15:28.960
Yeah, well do you really think

15:29.029 --> 15:32.326
I can only be sexual
and alluring on stage?

15:33.523 --> 15:35.857
No, but it's not the same.

15:35.926 --> 15:38.331
Yeah, well, we're not
so different me and her.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.665
Okay, that wasn't
what I was saying.

15:52.713 --> 15:57.285
A small part of me was
starting to second guess myself.

15:58.615 --> 16:01.183
Am I saying the right things?

16:01.252 --> 16:03.157
Do I look okay?

16:03.226 --> 16:05.861
Is this what people
want from me?

16:05.930 --> 16:08.056
I was thinking the bridge...

16:08.125 --> 16:10.196
One of the reasons why I
wanted to make a documentary

16:10.265 --> 16:11.598
in the first place is because

16:11.667 --> 16:14.732
I would finally be in
control of the narrative.

16:14.801 --> 16:17.540
How you actually seem
and how you think you seem,

16:17.609 --> 16:22.069
like those,
sometimes the gulf
is catastrophically wide.

16:22.138 --> 16:26.910
And so the idea is
to have how you sound

16:26.979 --> 16:31.350
and how you think you sound
be actually very married.

16:31.418 --> 16:33.686
I wanted this film
to be different.

16:33.755 --> 16:37.952
I didn't wanna feel pressure
to be somebody I'm not.

16:41.129 --> 16:43.067
It's always collaboration.

16:43.135 --> 16:46.069
I think the best skill
in being an artist

16:46.138 --> 16:49.270
is knowing who to
collaborate with.

16:49.339 --> 16:52.138
You don't own it,
it's not about you,

16:52.207 --> 16:53.711
and at its best this feels like

16:53.780 --> 16:56.379
this very ego-less experience.

16:56.448 --> 16:59.749
And I don't know if what
constitutes important artist is

16:59.817 --> 17:01.317
necessarily good art.

17:01.386 --> 17:03.584
I mean, that puts a huge
premium on the present tense.

17:03.653 --> 17:06.150
But what litmus test
do we have other than now?

17:06.219 --> 17:07.982
We have what lasts.

17:08.051 --> 17:12.130
We have what really
moves people's hearts.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.956
I mean half the time
people don't even realize

17:14.024 --> 17:17.262
that it's wonderful until
like generations later,

17:17.331 --> 17:19.501
and then it's super revered.

17:19.570 --> 17:20.599
Um.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.768
Is everything okay?

17:23.836 --> 17:24.839
I'm sorry, I'm just
getting these weird texts

17:24.908 --> 17:26.574
from my girlfriend.

17:26.643 --> 17:27.672
Oh.

17:31.578 --> 17:34.076
I think she's
breaking up with me.

17:34.145 --> 17:35.185
Oh God.

17:37.816 --> 17:40.652
I was doing a magazine
feature in London,

17:40.721 --> 17:43.460
and I stayed and went
to Paris fashion week,

17:43.529 --> 17:44.557
and...

17:46.932 --> 17:49.430
I've been gone for like a month.

17:51.264 --> 17:53.293
Am I a terrible person?

17:53.362 --> 17:55.271
No.

17:55.340 --> 17:59.466
No, you're just doing
whatever you have to do.

17:59.535 --> 18:00.936
Yeah, I guess.

18:04.378 --> 18:06.651
You're not a terrible person.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.449
You're not, I promise.

18:10.222 --> 18:13.491
Would you record a
message for her for me?

18:13.559 --> 18:14.817
Uh, sure.

18:14.886 --> 18:16.852
My girlfriend does
not trust me right now,

18:16.921 --> 18:19.355
but she's a huge,
huge fan of yours,

18:19.424 --> 18:20.626
and she would trust you

18:20.694 --> 18:22.390
if you told her that
I was a good person.

18:22.458 --> 18:23.497
Uh, yeah.

18:26.630 --> 18:28.332
Hey, this is Annie Clark,

18:28.400 --> 18:29.235
and I just wanted to--

18:29.304 --> 18:30.500
Oh, can you say St. Vincent,

18:30.569 --> 18:32.201
then she'll know who you are.

18:32.270 --> 18:33.309
Right.

18:35.639 --> 18:37.874
Hey, this is St. Vincent,

18:37.943 --> 18:42.379
and I just wanted to say
that your girlfriend--

18:42.448 --> 18:43.678
Holly.

18:43.747 --> 18:46.080
Holly, uh, loves you very much,

18:48.557 --> 18:52.086
and she's so sorry
that she has been gone

18:53.423 --> 18:54.859
so often--

18:54.928 --> 18:56.766
Would you also say that
she shouldn't give up on me,

18:56.835 --> 18:59.434
and that there is nobody

18:59.502 --> 19:03.398
who's gonna love her
the way I love her?

19:05.472 --> 19:08.235
And don't give up hope on her,

19:08.304 --> 19:12.810
because nobody's gonna love
you as much as she does.

19:14.415 --> 19:16.084
Okay, well, I'm really sorry.

19:16.153 --> 19:17.445
I hope everything works out.

19:17.514 --> 19:18.716
No, me too.

19:18.785 --> 19:21.522
Should we get back
to the interview?

19:22.652 --> 19:23.284
I think we're good.

19:23.353 --> 19:24.388
Really?

19:24.456 --> 19:25.354
That was great, yeah.

19:25.423 --> 19:26.091
That was it?

19:26.160 --> 19:26.862
Yeah, thank you.

19:26.931 --> 19:27.755
Yeah, you know what,

19:27.824 --> 19:29.291
actually, my cousin lives here,

19:29.360 --> 19:31.869
and your people only gave you
one ticket to Saturday night.

19:31.938 --> 19:33.269
Do you think you could maybe

19:33.338 --> 19:35.902
look into getting
a plus one for me?

19:35.971 --> 19:36.904
Sure.

19:36.972 --> 19:38.302
Thank you.

19:38.371 --> 19:40.134
Muah! Thank you.

19:41.514 --> 19:42.543
Bye.

19:43.681 --> 19:45.383
Wow.

19:45.451 --> 19:47.942
Uh, that woman, she didn't
listen to anything I said.

19:48.011 --> 19:50.479
I know, but you
still did her a favor,

19:50.548 --> 19:52.448
because you're too nice.

19:52.517 --> 19:54.754
Stop being so nice.

19:54.823 --> 19:57.254
I'm not getting her
stupid cousin into the show.

19:57.323 --> 19:58.090
Good.

19:58.159 --> 19:59.421
Yeah, don't.

19:59.490 --> 20:00.693
But can you?

20:02.562 --> 20:05.159
I don't want her
to be mad at me.

20:08.301 --> 20:09.767
You can cut.

20:09.836 --> 20:13.002
When she's not on
screen you can cut.

20:15.905 --> 20:17.343
I like that, yeah.

20:17.412 --> 20:19.245
Conjuring sort of a Patsy Cline.

20:19.314 --> 20:21.275
Oh, yeah, yeah.

20:21.343 --> 20:23.786
I feel like, uh...
I was thinking about, like, uh,

20:23.855 --> 20:25.481
some croonery.

20:35.900 --> 20:36.927
That's nice.

20:40.397 --> 20:41.334
Ah nice.

20:41.403 --> 20:44.242
And then it would be something.

20:50.443 --> 20:51.508
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:51.576 --> 20:52.839
Like a big like 70's,

20:52.908 --> 20:56.254
.

21:01.453 --> 21:02.386
Yeah, I like it.

21:02.455 --> 21:03.453
Yeah, that's cool.

21:03.522 --> 21:05.290
A refrain.

21:06.426 --> 21:07.854
Yeah, I love it.

21:07.923 --> 21:09.232
Like Keith Moon.

21:09.301 --> 21:12.094
What about, what
should it be about?

21:13.400 --> 21:15.229
That's up to you.

21:19.707 --> 21:22.975
I mean the alienation
of touring.

21:23.044 --> 21:24.411
No.

21:24.479 --> 21:27.345
Yeah, that's not
that relatable.

21:27.414 --> 21:29.579
I mean, heartbreak.

21:29.648 --> 21:31.487
No, that is very cloying.

21:34.488 --> 21:35.985
But your call, your call.

21:36.054 --> 21:39.253
What about that, just,
well of sorrow

21:40.565 --> 21:42.558
that everybody has from
like childhood trauma?

21:42.627 --> 21:44.225
That's very dark,

21:44.293 --> 21:47.701
but I love these ideas,
they, they're great.

21:53.913 --> 21:55.269
Just not for this.

22:23.107 --> 22:24.898
A cam, go to a two shot.

22:24.967 --> 22:26.610
Copy that.

22:26.679 --> 22:30.711
you and lose you

22:36.512 --> 22:39.083
I don't even like to
dress a salad, you know?

22:39.152 --> 22:42.493
I'm, like-- I wanna
taste the vegetables,

22:42.561 --> 22:44.324
otherwise,
why am I eating vegetables?

22:44.393 --> 22:45.425
I wanna taste the earth,

22:45.494 --> 22:46.959
I want to taste the dirt.

22:47.027 --> 22:49.496
So I just kind of
throw 'em all together,

22:49.564 --> 22:54.262
and eat 'em about 3:00 p.m.

23:04.677 --> 23:05.909
What's up, internet?

23:05.978 --> 23:07.475
It's your girl MovieDork here

23:07.544 --> 23:10.580
to talk about the top 10
documentaries of all time,

23:10.649 --> 23:11.917
in my opinion.

23:11.985 --> 23:13.485
Put your hate in
the comments below,

23:13.553 --> 23:14.750
or you could not.

23:14.819 --> 23:16.486
Before we get started...

23:16.555 --> 23:17.485
Hey.

23:17.554 --> 23:18.653
Hi.

23:18.721 --> 23:20.589
How is it?

23:20.657 --> 23:22.796
Uh, great.

23:22.865 --> 23:27.431
Yeah, no, the live
footage is really special.

23:27.500 --> 23:28.538
Are you sure?

23:32.770 --> 23:35.512
Okay, I was thinking,

23:35.580 --> 23:37.438
is there a way to
heighten it a little?

23:37.506 --> 23:41.584
You're nerdy and normal in
real life, which I love,

23:42.848 --> 23:44.521
but the disparity between that

23:44.589 --> 23:48.520
and who you are onstage
is kind of jarring,

23:48.589 --> 23:50.758
you know what I'm saying?

23:55.425 --> 23:56.633
I just wanted to give
you guys a little bit

23:56.701 --> 23:59.360
of a heads up that Carrie
and I have been talking,

23:59.428 --> 24:01.504
and we think that I
should veer more towards

24:01.573 --> 24:04.870
my onstage persona
for the documentary.

24:04.939 --> 24:06.008
So should
we call you St. Vincent?

24:06.076 --> 24:07.011
Oh God no.

24:07.079 --> 24:08.906
Wait, CB, should they?

24:08.975 --> 24:10.144
Uh, I
think Annie's okay.

24:10.213 --> 24:10.838
Yeah.

24:10.907 --> 24:11.741
I can do an accent.

24:11.810 --> 24:13.544
Want me to be Australian?

24:13.613 --> 24:14.577
Look at this size--

24:14.646 --> 24:15.576
No, no, no.

24:15.645 --> 24:16.350
Oh.

24:16.418 --> 24:17.682
No, please, go for it.

24:17.751 --> 24:20.221
Look at the size of that one.

24:20.290 --> 24:22.593
That's good, but no.

24:22.661 --> 24:26.025
It's just about me making
some subtle changes

24:26.094 --> 24:28.996
so that I can be a little
bit more interesting.

24:29.065 --> 24:29.858
Exactly.

24:29.927 --> 24:31.567
How about in your new role

24:31.636 --> 24:35.000
you do a formal
introduction of the band.

24:36.773 --> 24:40.434
And everyone we're gonna
look to the camera.

24:45.614 --> 24:48.178
This is Toko, she's Japanese.

24:49.250 --> 24:50.552
Hi.

24:50.621 --> 24:53.187
And this
is Neil, he's Neil.

24:53.255 --> 24:54.723
Good day.

24:54.791 --> 24:57.718
And this is Robert, the
skins man of the group.

24:57.787 --> 24:59.023
Hello.

24:59.092 --> 25:01.796
Or in lay people's
terms, the drummer.

25:04.694 --> 25:05.800
Um,

25:10.107 --> 25:11.436
we got it.

25:11.505 --> 25:12.601
Yeah, we got it.

25:12.670 --> 25:14.235
Great.

25:14.304 --> 25:16.613
Toko's cat got
eaten by a coyote,

25:16.681 --> 25:20.882
and Robert's wife
had a breeched birth.

25:20.951 --> 25:23.620
The umbilical cord was wrapped
around the baby's neck,

25:23.689 --> 25:26.056
like it was trying to
hang itself in utero.

25:26.125 --> 25:27.883
And that was after what,

25:27.951 --> 25:29.692
multiple miscarriages.

25:36.964 --> 25:41.231
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry you guys.

25:42.741 --> 25:45.636
Toko, I didn't mean
to call you Japanese.

25:45.705 --> 25:48.768
Toko is Japanese.

25:48.837 --> 25:53.507
I was thinking maybe this
should just be a concert film.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.849
Because I can't be
who you want me to be.

25:57.917 --> 26:00.120
No, because what
you do on stage

26:00.189 --> 26:04.692
is really hard to duplicate
off stage, and that's okay.

26:04.761 --> 26:06.696
I can be St.
Vincent all the time.

26:06.764 --> 26:08.698
No, Annie,
I was saying I'm wrong.

26:08.767 --> 26:10.624
Let's protect the fact
that you're normal,

26:10.693 --> 26:14.634
that your life isn't crazy
or interesting enough

26:14.703 --> 26:17.201
to make a documentary about.

26:40.531 --> 26:42.132
Pass please.

26:42.201 --> 26:43.690
Oh, I'm playing tonight.

26:43.759 --> 26:47.605
I need
to see a pass to let you in.

26:50.770 --> 26:52.801
So, it's my band,

26:52.870 --> 26:54.073
I'm St. Vincent.

26:54.972 --> 26:56.812
I'm on all the posters.

26:58.210 --> 27:01.743
Don't know who you are.

27:01.812 --> 27:02.680
Dude.

27:02.749 --> 27:04.820
Sorry.

27:05.782 --> 27:06.822
Thanks.

27:07.821 --> 27:09.751
For what?

27:09.820 --> 27:10.859
Sorry.

27:20.904 --> 27:23.740
Check one,
two, check, check.

27:23.809 --> 27:27.772
Can I have my vocal,
like monitor, please?

27:27.840 --> 27:29.173
It's my fucking show,

27:29.242 --> 27:31.776
you're gonna save me
from fucking ISIS,

27:31.844 --> 27:33.607
fuck you fucking cock.

27:40.817 --> 27:45.089
Oh, my lips and teeth
turning red from the wine?

27:45.158 --> 27:46.888
No.
-  You sure?

27:46.957 --> 27:47.855
Yeah.

27:47.924 --> 27:48.593
Smile.

27:48.661 --> 27:50.801
Very good.

27:50.869 --> 27:53.365
I bet Annie asked people
to give us the good wine.

27:53.434 --> 27:57.239
She was trying really hard
to impress me the other day.

27:57.308 --> 27:58.802
Is she nice?

27:58.871 --> 28:00.234
No, she's a snob.

28:00.303 --> 28:04.738
Totally impenetrable and aloof.

28:04.807 --> 28:07.617
I don't care,
I fucking love her music.

28:07.686 --> 28:10.611
Me too,
she's so beautiful.

28:10.679 --> 28:11.819
I just want her
to punch me in the face.

28:11.887 --> 28:13.381
Stop it,
you're making her

28:13.450 --> 28:15.148
way more interesting
than she is.

28:15.217 --> 28:16.893
Where is she anyway?

28:16.961 --> 28:19.460
She's like a boss,
you show up late, right?

28:19.529 --> 28:20.894
That's something.

28:20.962 --> 28:23.628
You are
right about that.

29:02.268 --> 29:03.673
This is a little frustrating.

29:03.741 --> 29:05.699
I don't wanna waste
16mm film,

29:05.767 --> 29:07.769
but maybe with
a little distance she'll--

29:07.838 --> 29:08.840
CB.

29:08.908 --> 29:09.836
CB, get your cameras.

29:09.905 --> 29:12.006
No, no, we're
set up for the live show.

29:12.075 --> 29:13.510
Don't worry.

29:13.579 --> 29:17.649
No, no, no, I want them
here now, I changed my mind.

29:17.718 --> 29:18.756
Yes.

29:20.722 --> 29:21.988
Ask me a question.

29:22.057 --> 29:22.854
What
kind of question?

29:22.922 --> 29:24.795
Any fucking question.

29:24.864 --> 29:28.658
Annie, what's
going through your mind?

29:28.726 --> 29:32.396
How it doesn't matter how
I feel on any given night.

29:32.465 --> 29:34.198
That no matter what I
owe it all to my fans

29:34.267 --> 29:36.965
to give them my blood,
sweat and tears.

29:37.034 --> 29:37.868
Great.

29:37.937 --> 29:39.869
No, I can do it better.

29:39.937 --> 29:40.572
Let's go.

29:40.641 --> 29:41.344
Okay.

29:41.413 --> 29:42.069
I guess we're resetting.

29:42.138 --> 29:43.072
Back to one.

29:43.141 --> 29:46.740
Let's reset and hold here.

29:48.046 --> 29:49.678
Give me the line.

29:49.747 --> 29:51.855
Ask me "Annie, what's
going through your mind?"

29:51.924 --> 29:54.752
Annie, what's
going through your mind?

29:54.821 --> 29:56.053
Great question.

29:56.122 --> 29:57.721
What's going through my mind?

29:57.790 --> 30:00.420
I guess how it doesn't matter
how I feel on any given night,

30:00.489 --> 30:01.698
but I owe it all to my fans

30:01.767 --> 30:04.096
to give them my blood,
sweat and tears.

30:04.165 --> 30:05.560
But sometimes I
worry I'm not enough.

30:05.629 --> 30:07.770
Sometimes I worry
that I might fall.

30:07.839 --> 30:09.935
Wait,
do you mean fail?

30:10.004 --> 30:11.365
I feel like fail may be better.

30:11.434 --> 30:12.835
You know what, fail is better.

30:12.904 --> 30:13.934
Okay.

30:14.003 --> 30:15.108
Cue me.

30:15.177 --> 30:16.839
Okay, what's going
through your mind.

30:16.908 --> 30:18.111
Annie.

30:18.180 --> 30:20.948
Annie, what's going
through your mind?

30:21.016 --> 30:23.717
How I worry that
sometimes I won't,

30:23.785 --> 30:24.915
that I have to give--

30:24.984 --> 30:26.186
You were saying

30:26.254 --> 30:29.023
giving all your fans
every single night--

30:29.092 --> 30:31.021
You know what, can
you just transcribe it?

30:31.089 --> 30:32.721
I'll hit it tomorrow.

30:32.790 --> 30:34.562
Okay, but I think it
doesn't have to be perfect.

30:34.631 --> 30:36.130
I like the honesty.

30:36.198 --> 30:37.897
I am being honest about
needing you to do that,

30:37.966 --> 30:40.029
and it does have to be perfect.

30:40.098 --> 30:41.795
Here, get me like this.

30:44.837 --> 30:45.738
Cigarette.

30:45.807 --> 30:47.377
You don't smoke though.

30:47.446 --> 30:48.912
I mean that's silly.

30:48.981 --> 30:52.806
This is how actors play
rock stars in movies.

30:54.719 --> 30:56.652
Yeah, but you are a rockstar.

30:56.721 --> 30:57.912
I mean, I know rock stars--

30:57.981 --> 30:59.021
Shh.

31:02.889 --> 31:03.791
I love you baby,

31:03.860 --> 31:05.863
but I'm married to the road.

31:11.327 --> 31:12.826
Have a good show.

33:25.602 --> 33:26.630
Great.

33:28.600 --> 33:31.173
Oh, so sorry, I'll
be right back.

33:37.483 --> 33:39.374
Nice sunglasses.

33:39.442 --> 33:41.348
Will you announce me?

33:42.346 --> 33:43.720
Will you let people know

33:43.789 --> 33:46.221
that I'm walking into the space?

33:52.623 --> 33:56.128
Ladies and
gentlemen, St. Vincent.

34:05.238 --> 34:07.341
Annie, that was terrific.

34:09.071 --> 34:12.174
I would like to introduce
you to my cousin, Sarah.

34:12.243 --> 34:13.275
Sarah, Annie.

34:13.344 --> 34:14.579
Nice to meet you.

34:14.648 --> 34:16.509
Thanks so much for
getting me into the show.

34:16.578 --> 34:18.515
It was my pleasure.

34:18.583 --> 34:21.421
It's such a gift
to have you here.

34:21.489 --> 34:23.957
Do you think I could
take a picture with you?

34:24.025 --> 34:25.319
I'll take it.

34:25.388 --> 34:26.459
Actually, no.

34:33.271 --> 34:35.100
I'm so sorry, I think
she's really tired.

34:35.169 --> 34:38.305
Or maybe she's just brave.

34:38.374 --> 34:41.945
That kind of honesty
is so refreshing.

34:42.014 --> 34:44.939
Finally, a woman
speaking her truth.

34:46.408 --> 34:47.447
Yeah.

35:52.917 --> 35:55.114
Hey Care, it's Dad.

35:55.183 --> 35:57.378
I'm sorry to miss you.

35:57.447 --> 36:01.625
I'm off to Minnesota tomorrow
to meet with a specialist.

36:01.693 --> 36:05.257
Still try and see if he could
get a day off and come visit.

36:05.326 --> 36:07.622
I know you're crazy busy.

36:07.691 --> 36:09.398
Your uncle is coming with,

36:09.467 --> 36:12.263
so if you can't get
ahold of me, try him.

36:12.332 --> 36:13.867
Okay, honey, I love you.

36:13.936 --> 36:15.172
Bye, bye.

36:37.562 --> 36:38.252
Hey.

36:38.321 --> 36:39.289
Hi.

36:39.358 --> 36:40.421
Did you wanna talk?

36:40.490 --> 36:41.255
Not exactly.

36:41.324 --> 36:42.364
Come in.

36:46.133 --> 36:47.468
Hi, Carrie.

36:47.537 --> 36:51.164
Carrie, you remember
my girlfriend, Dakota.

36:53.570 --> 36:55.410
We want you to film us.

36:58.247 --> 36:59.676
I don't have a camera though.

36:59.745 --> 37:02.780
Well, you're a
director, so direct.

37:05.351 --> 37:07.422
You can use your phone.

37:09.187 --> 37:13.186
You're the one who wanted
this to be more interesting.

37:21.400 --> 37:22.334
Whenever you're ready.

37:22.403 --> 37:25.341
I want this to be artistic,

37:25.410 --> 37:29.202
Scandinavian, European,
anything but American.

37:30.612 --> 37:32.438
It's still in
English though, right?

37:32.507 --> 37:33.547
Oui.

37:34.577 --> 37:35.678
Okay.

37:35.746 --> 37:38.387
CB, can
you come closer?

37:39.517 --> 37:41.489
We're set.

37:41.558 --> 37:45.218
Okay, get on the bed,
you're too far away.

37:47.392 --> 37:48.430
Come.

37:55.405 --> 37:56.662
That's a good angle
right there.

37:56.731 --> 37:58.132
Okay.

37:59.405 --> 38:01.168
Rolling.

38:02.309 --> 38:03.010
I love you.

38:03.079 --> 38:05.476
I love you.

38:05.545 --> 38:06.409
Who's face is that?

38:06.478 --> 38:08.478
My face.

38:08.546 --> 38:10.082
Who's lips are those?

38:10.151 --> 38:11.513
My lips.

38:11.582 --> 38:13.819
Hey, sorry to interrupt,

38:13.888 --> 38:17.354
there's this thing that
people are doing in the film

38:17.423 --> 38:19.395
and television industry

38:19.463 --> 38:21.831
where they hire an
intimacy coordinator.

38:21.900 --> 38:24.363
It's for sex scenes,

38:24.432 --> 38:26.030
and it's just to help people

38:26.099 --> 38:30.434
be more comfortable with nudity
and touching and consent.

38:30.502 --> 38:31.370
It's okay, I consent.

38:31.439 --> 38:33.400
And she consents, obviously.

38:33.469 --> 38:35.004
Mm-hmm.

38:35.072 --> 38:35.869
The only thing I
stipulate is you just don't

38:35.938 --> 38:37.110
show any of my pubic region.

38:37.179 --> 38:38.447
I stipulate nothing.

38:38.515 --> 38:43.581
Please get the camera as
close to me as you need.

38:43.649 --> 38:44.678
I guess I should
have clarified.

38:44.747 --> 38:46.420
I guess for my comfort,

38:46.489 --> 38:49.283
I would love to just
shoot her a text

38:49.351 --> 38:51.427
and see if she could maybe
call in and consult.

38:51.496 --> 38:52.862
Yeah, but can we just
get this version first?

38:52.931 --> 38:54.364
Yeah, it's better.

39:00.602 --> 39:02.230
Remember
when we went to Tulum

39:02.299 --> 39:05.740
and had those really,
really good poached eggs?

39:05.809 --> 39:06.635
Mm-hmm.

39:06.704 --> 39:08.638
That bowl of mixed fruit.

39:08.707 --> 39:09.639
Yeah, was it papaya or mango?

39:09.708 --> 39:11.377
I always get them confused.

39:11.446 --> 39:12.111
I don't know because mangoes--

39:12.951 --> 39:13.775
Oh, she just texted,

39:13.844 --> 39:15.446
and she can call in 10 minutes,

39:15.515 --> 39:16.445
if you can just hold off.

39:16.514 --> 39:18.249
Uh, we can't.

39:18.318 --> 39:19.356
No, we can't.

39:20.722 --> 39:23.389
Um, wait, guys, just
for legal purposes.

39:23.458 --> 39:26.154
I'm gonna turn the camera on me.

39:45.541 --> 39:46.245
Hi.

39:46.314 --> 39:47.476
Hey, how are you?

39:47.544 --> 39:48.643
I'm great.

39:48.712 --> 39:50.618
Last night was...

39:51.514 --> 39:53.254
magical.

39:53.323 --> 39:55.456
Yeah, glad I was there for it.

39:55.524 --> 39:58.485
Speaking of that,
if there's ever

39:58.554 --> 40:01.595
anything you don't want in
the movie, just let me know.

40:01.664 --> 40:05.702
I'm not interested
in hiding anything.

40:05.771 --> 40:07.294
Okay.

40:07.363 --> 40:10.700
I just thought, I thought
we could check in.

40:10.769 --> 40:12.503
It feels like it's been a second

40:12.572 --> 40:13.810
since we actually talked.

40:13.879 --> 40:15.672
About what?

40:15.741 --> 40:18.711
Like, my dad called yesterday,

40:18.780 --> 40:22.645
he wants me to visit
him on a day off.

40:22.713 --> 40:24.447
Do we have a day off?

40:24.515 --> 40:25.554
We don't.

40:28.454 --> 40:29.690
How's your mom?

40:29.759 --> 40:32.527
Oh, so now you care
about my boring life.

40:32.596 --> 40:35.696
Annie, I feel like
we can differentiate

40:35.765 --> 40:39.701
between who we are in
the movie and real life.

40:39.770 --> 40:44.232
So, as your friend, I'm
asking you, how is your mom?

40:46.638 --> 40:47.906
She is wonderful.

40:53.049 --> 40:54.077
Okay.

40:56.582 --> 40:58.081
Two, three, four.

41:04.619 --> 41:08.862
back from the road

41:08.931 --> 41:12.602
take off my clothes

41:12.670 --> 41:17.504
in the only world?

41:25.981 --> 41:27.914
People understand
that when I'm on stage

41:27.982 --> 41:31.312
I'm playing a bigger
version of myself.

41:34.659 --> 41:36.191
But what some people
fail to understand

41:36.260 --> 41:38.121
is that all of it's me,

41:40.660 --> 41:42.356
and none of it's me.

41:51.833 --> 41:55.942
Sometimes you have to reject
not only your former self,

41:56.011 --> 41:59.472
but, also, the people
who came along with it.

42:02.043 --> 42:02.942
Annie, so good tonight.

42:03.011 --> 42:04.983
Seriously, like awesome.

42:48.699 --> 42:51.524
Annie, just a
reminder that I wanted

42:53.529 --> 42:57.200
to film a scene with you
and one of your fans.

42:59.206 --> 43:03.312
You know, just to show how
intense the connection is.

43:03.381 --> 43:05.041
I feel like people, you know,

43:05.110 --> 43:06.615
they get really
emotional around you.

43:06.684 --> 43:09.542
It just might be nice
to show that.

43:10.452 --> 43:11.951
Sure, sounds good.

43:13.916 --> 43:16.384
Okay, great.

43:16.452 --> 43:20.960
And then maybe after the
show we could play cards

43:21.028 --> 43:24.557
or get a drink or watch
a movie on the bus.

43:42.779 --> 43:43.818
Annie?

43:47.425 --> 43:49.923
I think Ms. Vincent is asleep.

43:56.665 --> 43:57.729
She's weird, you
don't see that?

43:57.798 --> 43:59.830
I don't really see it at all?

43:59.899 --> 44:00.701
What are you talking about?

44:00.769 --> 44:01.933
I don't know, I
just need someone

44:02.002 --> 44:03.705
to make her seem
more relatable again.

44:03.774 --> 44:06.703
Oh, well right
there, take your pick.

44:12.912 --> 44:14.111
Hey, excuse me, I'm Carrie.

44:14.180 --> 44:16.680
I'm making a documentary
about St. Vincent.

44:16.749 --> 44:17.579
What's your name?

44:17.648 --> 44:18.584
Kim.

44:18.652 --> 44:19.749
Hey, nice to meet you.

44:19.818 --> 44:21.015
You wanna come with me?

44:21.084 --> 44:23.753
I have a surprise for you.

44:28.463 --> 44:29.666
Come in.

44:31.795 --> 44:32.629
Annie?

44:32.698 --> 44:33.736
Yeah.

44:34.797 --> 44:35.837
Kim.

44:37.605 --> 44:39.304
Meet St. Vincent.

44:39.373 --> 44:40.402
Hi, Kim.

44:42.512 --> 44:44.637
This is so amazing.

44:46.010 --> 44:48.216
Aww, so nice to meet you.

44:48.285 --> 44:49.642
Hi, how are you?

44:51.012 --> 44:52.051
I'm--

44:53.883 --> 44:54.922
It's okay.

44:55.955 --> 44:57.783
You literally saved my life.

44:57.852 --> 44:59.954
I start, I've been listening
to you since I was 16.

45:00.023 --> 45:01.122
I grew up in Fresno,

45:01.191 --> 45:02.895
and my high school boyfriend

45:02.964 --> 45:05.658
gave me "Strange Mercy"
for my birthday.

45:07.967 --> 45:09.669
Two nights before we graduated,

45:09.738 --> 45:12.203
he was killed in a car accident.

45:13.911 --> 45:16.306
Your songs were the only
thing that got me through.

45:16.374 --> 45:19.672
I wouldn't be alive
without your music.

45:21.980 --> 45:24.844
That means so much to me.

45:24.913 --> 45:29.682
I never thought I'd
get to tell you that in person.

45:37.561 --> 45:40.935
That's just
so tragic and so sad.

45:43.737 --> 45:45.698
Don't be sad, it's okay.

45:51.338 --> 45:52.947
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

45:55.211 --> 45:57.710
It's just a lot, you know?

45:58.586 --> 45:59.817
It's a lot.

45:59.886 --> 46:01.982
It must be so hard.

46:12.063 --> 46:14.232
Actually people

46:14.300 --> 46:15.569
that might not even
know your music,

46:15.638 --> 46:17.039
which is most people.

46:17.107 --> 46:18.539
No.
- I don't know how to--

46:18.607 --> 46:19.475
Which is fine.

46:19.544 --> 46:20.575
No, but just that they actually

46:20.644 --> 46:21.844
think this is a good film.

46:21.912 --> 46:23.040
Yeah I
want people to see

46:23.108 --> 46:24.071
how I have to kind of train.

46:24.140 --> 46:24.974
Yeah.

46:25.042 --> 46:25.878
To do it.

46:25.947 --> 46:27.246
Like how physical the show is.

46:27.314 --> 46:27.977
It's okay,
we'll get your muscles.

46:28.046 --> 46:29.714
You see that?

46:29.783 --> 46:30.820
You see that?

46:32.216 --> 46:32.883
Yeah, look at mine.

46:32.951 --> 46:33.916
Oh my God.

46:33.984 --> 46:35.221
Not bad, right?

46:35.290 --> 46:36.048
That's quite
a bush you got there.

46:36.117 --> 46:37.083
Shut up.

46:37.924 --> 46:40.090
I would like to thank,

46:40.158 --> 46:41.894
I would like to thank--

46:41.963 --> 46:43.759
I'll thank you first.

46:43.828 --> 46:47.931
Okay, I would
like to thank Carrie.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.063
Annie Cwauk.

46:49.131 --> 46:50.734
Annie Cwauk.

47:12.159 --> 47:17.127
my own tonight

47:29.513 --> 47:31.245
Sorry, what was that?

47:31.314 --> 47:32.207
Fatigue.

47:32.276 --> 47:34.477
That's what I was thinking.

47:41.155 --> 47:44.116
I don't think it sings
very well.

47:44.185 --> 47:45.654
Okay.

47:45.722 --> 47:49.690
Well, I could do a solo
over what you're playing.

47:50.832 --> 47:52.396
Okay.

47:56.168 --> 48:00.133
- You know.
-

48:00.201 --> 48:05.512
Like a...

48:05.581 --> 48:06.972
You know what?

48:07.041 --> 48:08.980
Honestly, I think I should
just work on this song

48:09.049 --> 48:11.748
by myself for a little bit.

48:11.817 --> 48:13.756
Okay.

48:13.824 --> 48:16.787
Maybe I'll just
write my own song.

48:16.856 --> 48:18.794
For whose movie?

48:18.862 --> 48:20.126
All right, here's
your cappuccino,

48:20.195 --> 48:23.189
and I got you some
extra guitar picks.

48:23.257 --> 48:24.664
Thank you.

48:24.733 --> 48:26.099
Sorry, who are you?

48:26.168 --> 48:28.997
Oh, Carrie, I got
you a new assistant.

48:29.065 --> 48:30.104
This is--

48:31.102 --> 48:33.131
Kayla. What's up?

48:33.200 --> 48:34.837
Hey.

48:34.906 --> 48:36.273
No, I just thought you could
use somebody to hang out with

48:36.341 --> 48:38.948
so you could talk
about your dad.

48:41.617 --> 48:42.875
I love dads.

48:46.050 --> 48:46.982
Thanks, Kayla.

48:47.050 --> 48:48.089
Oh, yeah.

50:24.649 --> 50:29.652
lonely winter

50:49.343 --> 50:58.117
blind psychics

51:15.403 --> 51:20.406
lonely winter

51:23.708 --> 51:28.040
lonely winter

52:31.243 --> 52:32.077
I'm gonna miss ya.

52:32.146 --> 52:34.106
Thanks, same here, Brian.

52:36.412 --> 52:37.614
Good times, huh?

52:37.683 --> 52:39.249
Yeah, I really
appreciate everything.

52:39.317 --> 52:40.349
Good luck with the uh,

52:40.417 --> 52:41.452
the rest of the tour.

52:41.520 --> 52:42.351
Hey, no problem,
good luck to you.

52:42.420 --> 52:43.285
I called the car service,

52:43.354 --> 52:45.119
it should be here soon.

52:45.188 --> 52:46.057
Thanks.

52:46.126 --> 52:48.120
All right, later, dude.

53:53.324 --> 53:54.320
Uncle Pete?

53:54.389 --> 53:56.696
Yep.

53:56.765 --> 53:59.461
I mean, he sounded decent
last time we talked.

53:59.529 --> 54:01.928
Well, he's holding up.

54:01.997 --> 54:04.531
Mainly, I think he's
just depressed.

54:04.600 --> 54:06.101
You know your dad,

54:06.170 --> 54:08.372
he doesn't like having to
count on anybody else for help.

54:08.441 --> 54:09.507
I mean, I tried to visit him

54:09.576 --> 54:10.340
when we went through
the Northwest,

54:10.408 --> 54:12.340
but this tour has been

54:12.409 --> 54:13.772
kind of crazy.

54:13.840 --> 54:15.645
Hey, I gotta tell you,

54:15.713 --> 54:19.317
this documentary
you're working on,

54:19.386 --> 54:22.348
it's really lifted his spirits.

54:22.417 --> 54:24.557
Now this will be a little
embarrassing to hear maybe,

54:24.626 --> 54:27.329
but every doctor and
nurse at that hospital

54:27.397 --> 54:31.123
knows all about his
daughter, the director.

54:31.192 --> 54:32.961
I have done other
things, you know?

54:33.030 --> 54:35.529
I know, I know,
but this is different.

54:35.598 --> 54:37.462
This is artistic.

54:37.531 --> 54:38.638
Yes.

54:38.707 --> 54:41.038
He's just bragging a
little because he loves ya.

54:41.107 --> 54:42.009
Right.

54:42.078 --> 54:43.411
Your dad, he keeps saying,

54:43.480 --> 54:46.447
I gotta be healthy in
time for the premier.

54:47.645 --> 54:50.647
When is the premier, by the way?

54:50.716 --> 54:53.713
Well, we'd have
to finish the movie

54:53.782 --> 54:56.017
for there to be a premier.

54:57.284 --> 54:59.521
Well, I guess I'm
just here to tell you

54:59.589 --> 55:03.226
to finish your movie.

55:25.646 --> 55:26.685
Annie?

55:50.704 --> 55:51.743
Hi Carrie.

55:58.551 --> 56:01.148
Are you ready to get to work?

56:02.990 --> 56:04.019
Yes.

56:11.168 --> 56:13.369
I want a sensory experience.

56:14.730 --> 56:15.664
I wanna bridge the gap

56:15.733 --> 56:19.341
between audience and performer.

56:19.410 --> 56:21.175
I'm no longer
interested in gestures

56:21.244 --> 56:23.472
that come solely from the stage.

56:23.541 --> 56:25.575
The audience cheers,

56:25.644 --> 56:27.446
that's all the gesture you need.

56:27.514 --> 56:29.441
Cheering is born
of expectation.

56:29.509 --> 56:32.917
It's the audience performing
being an audience.

56:32.985 --> 56:35.519
You're playing the
biggest shows of your life,

56:35.588 --> 56:37.015
why do you wanna sabotage it?

56:37.084 --> 56:40.292
I want to disrupt the senses.

56:40.361 --> 56:42.924
How are you gonna do that?

56:42.992 --> 56:46.466
By finally
admitting the truth.

56:46.534 --> 56:49.503
That the audience
doesn't need me,

56:49.572 --> 56:52.971
I'm just a vessel
for their feelings.

56:53.040 --> 56:57.545
Also, this is the only item
I'll be selling at my shows.

57:23.704 --> 57:25.366
Say something.

57:25.435 --> 57:26.475
No.

57:38.381 --> 57:41.413
Slipping into this
new mode was freeing.

58:07.912 --> 58:10.717
Carrie, give a thought.

58:10.786 --> 58:13.346
How am I gonna learn?

58:20.128 --> 58:24.633
I feel like I'm in, I'm in
the failure era of my life,

58:24.702 --> 58:26.628
where people don't like
the shit I'm doing.

58:26.696 --> 58:28.569
I'm not joking.

58:28.638 --> 58:31.600
People don't like
what I'm doing.

58:31.669 --> 58:32.637
I'm grappling.

58:32.705 --> 58:34.906
But what's weird is I claim,

58:36.604 --> 58:38.744
and I can't even tell
if it's real anymore.

58:38.813 --> 58:41.617
I do think that
the artist's role,

58:41.685 --> 58:43.585
the writer's role
is to thrash around,

58:43.654 --> 58:46.650
to make mistakes,
to be out of step.

58:46.719 --> 58:48.819
But then when I am out of step,

58:48.888 --> 58:51.123
-I feel terrible.
-Yeah.

58:51.192 --> 58:55.759
You know, when I'm out of step
with what people like,

58:55.827 --> 58:58.423
then I feel down on myself.

58:58.492 --> 59:01.402
But I, but
philosophically, I think

59:01.470 --> 59:04.402
no, that's how it should be.

59:04.471 --> 59:06.634
I don't know.

59:06.702 --> 59:10.777
I kind of think I just wanna
make things with friends.

59:15.813 --> 59:17.509
It's beautiful today.

59:42.577 --> 59:45.042
Hey, Carrie, where's your wig?

59:50.714 --> 59:51.752
CB.

59:56.853 --> 59:58.785
Where's your wig?

1:00:24.485 --> 1:00:26.314
We're in this together.

1:00:29.883 --> 1:00:30.923
Are we?

1:00:31.888 --> 1:00:33.354
Mm-hmm, me and me.

1:00:43.768 --> 1:00:44.996
There she is.

1:01:10.697 --> 1:01:12.894
Hey, Care, it's Dad.

1:01:12.963 --> 1:01:15.233
It's been a rough week,

1:01:15.301 --> 1:01:17.364
but your uncle told me
that you seemed good.

1:01:17.433 --> 1:01:20.766
And I can't wait
to see the movie.

1:01:20.835 --> 1:01:22.605
Honey, I am just so
happy that you're finally

1:01:22.674 --> 1:01:27.144
doing the kind of work that
you were always meant to do.

1:01:48.697 --> 1:01:52.873
Um, so, Annie has asked
that I do a formal interview

1:01:57.006 --> 1:01:57.836
with the two of you.

1:01:57.905 --> 1:01:58.641
Mm-hmm.

1:01:58.710 --> 1:01:59.944
Cool, great.

1:02:00.013 --> 1:02:01.606
I think it's the
first time we've ever

1:02:01.675 --> 1:02:03.910
gone on the record
about our relationship.

1:02:03.979 --> 1:02:05.343
Mm, mm-hmm.

1:02:05.412 --> 1:02:06.817
Yeah, well, the live sex act

1:02:06.886 --> 1:02:08.279
you had me shoot the other night

1:02:08.348 --> 1:02:10.915
felt pretty on the record.

1:02:10.984 --> 1:02:12.024
Thanks.

1:02:14.529 --> 1:02:15.963
How did you meet?

1:02:16.032 --> 1:02:20.263
Oh, well, we connected
on a very personal level.

1:02:21.866 --> 1:02:23.834
Through our agents.

1:02:23.903 --> 1:02:24.837
I wasn't even gay at the time.

1:02:24.906 --> 1:02:27.776
Nuh-uh, I turned
her gay.

1:02:27.844 --> 1:02:30.702
That's very inspirational...
for someone.

1:02:32.543 --> 1:02:37.313
How do relationships play
into the creative process?

1:02:37.382 --> 1:02:41.817
So much of what I write
is fueled by romance.

1:02:41.886 --> 1:02:43.782
The good, the bad.

1:02:43.851 --> 1:02:48.026
For example, when I was
working on "Mass Seduction,"

1:02:48.095 --> 1:02:49.992
I was-- you know,
I was going through

1:02:50.061 --> 1:02:51.832
a really hard time in my life,

1:02:51.901 --> 1:02:56.496
but what I learned
was that sometimes

1:02:56.565 --> 1:02:59.599
you have to go to
the depth of despair

1:03:01.371 --> 1:03:04.241
in order to extract
something true.

1:03:05.873 --> 1:03:07.310
I don't think I could
even write another record

1:03:07.378 --> 1:03:10.644
without having my heart
totally ripped out.

1:03:10.713 --> 1:03:11.885
Well, maybe you just have
to write this next one

1:03:11.954 --> 1:03:15.021
about being really
happy and content.

1:03:17.392 --> 1:03:19.017
Yeah.

1:03:19.086 --> 1:03:19.986
Baby?

1:03:20.055 --> 1:03:21.056
Mm-hmm.

1:03:21.125 --> 1:03:23.755
I wanted to propose something.

1:03:25.466 --> 1:03:26.494
What?

1:03:27.461 --> 1:03:29.761
Right now?
On-- on camera?

1:03:31.131 --> 1:03:32.704
Oh my God.

1:03:32.772 --> 1:03:34.634
I wanted to propose...

1:03:36.910 --> 1:03:39.540
that we break up
in a few months.

1:03:43.851 --> 1:03:45.714
I know it seems really sudden.

1:03:45.783 --> 1:03:46.853
What?

1:03:46.922 --> 1:03:49.590
And believe me,
I am so happy with you,

1:03:49.659 --> 1:03:51.924
it's just that I'm too happy,

1:03:51.993 --> 1:03:53.555
and I've got another
record to write.

1:03:53.623 --> 1:03:56.187
And if I don't, you know,
really shake things up,

1:03:56.256 --> 1:03:57.457
I'm gonna be--

1:03:57.526 --> 1:03:59.725
- What?
- Yeah, I won't be able to...

1:04:02.766 --> 1:04:05.565
- Why are you doing this?
- We can do it any way you want.

1:04:05.634 --> 1:04:07.370
I mean, it doesn't
have to be some, like--

1:04:07.438 --> 1:04:10.039
outside a night club
or on a red carpet.

1:04:10.108 --> 1:04:13.080
It could be just the two of us

1:04:13.149 --> 1:04:15.148
in the hotel room
just screaming at each other,

1:04:15.216 --> 1:04:17.947
or, I don't know, or maybe
your parents would come.

1:04:18.016 --> 1:04:19.715
No, I don't wanna do that.

1:04:19.784 --> 1:04:22.983
You're the only person I have
ever wanted to do this with.

1:04:23.052 --> 1:04:23.921
This is crazy,

1:04:23.990 --> 1:04:24.919
why don't we just break up now?

1:04:24.988 --> 1:04:26.053
Let's do that.

1:04:26.122 --> 1:04:27.120
- No.
- Yeah.

1:04:27.189 --> 1:04:28.224
- No.
- Yeah.

1:04:28.293 --> 1:04:30.058
- Because I love you.
- You do?

1:04:30.127 --> 1:04:31.061
- Yes.
- Really?

1:04:31.130 --> 1:04:33.128
Yes.
And I'm still on tour.

1:04:33.197 --> 1:04:34.295
And I like having you around.

1:04:34.363 --> 1:04:37.103
God, Annie that
is so fucked up.

1:04:41.073 --> 1:04:41.972
I'm sorry if this doesn't align

1:04:42.041 --> 1:04:44.077
with your artistic process.

1:04:47.846 --> 1:04:48.884
Goodbye, Annie.

1:04:50.046 --> 1:04:51.110
St. Vincent.

1:04:51.179 --> 1:04:52.945
Dakota, wait.

1:04:53.014 --> 1:04:54.180
Hey.

1:04:54.249 --> 1:04:55.550
Dakota, don't go.

1:04:56.760 --> 1:04:58.223
- I love you.
-

1:04:59.891 --> 1:05:01.462
That was crazy,

1:05:01.531 --> 1:05:02.797
what are you doing?

1:05:02.865 --> 1:05:05.000
None of that
stays in the film.

1:05:05.068 --> 1:05:09.461
Annie, what
did you expect to happen?

1:05:09.530 --> 1:05:13.666
From now on, I need more say

1:05:13.735 --> 1:05:16.868
in how other people
are going to act.

1:05:18.075 --> 1:05:19.946
It's a documentary.

1:05:20.015 --> 1:05:22.143
Okay, well, then
let's only document

1:05:22.211 --> 1:05:23.875
things I can control.

1:05:30.127 --> 1:05:32.190
Hey y'all, and welcome to Texas.

1:05:32.259 --> 1:05:35.520
Come on in, y'all
want some ice tea?

1:05:35.589 --> 1:05:38.697
I grew up surrounded by music.

1:05:38.766 --> 1:05:39.995
Annie always stood out,

1:05:40.064 --> 1:05:42.064
even among her siblings.

1:05:42.133 --> 1:05:44.071
We all had to share a bed,

1:05:44.140 --> 1:05:46.034
and she used to sing
us to sleep at night.

1:05:46.103 --> 1:05:47.703
Voice of an angel.

1:05:47.771 --> 1:05:50.043
Annie was the kindest
sister I could ever hope for.

1:05:50.112 --> 1:05:52.639
Biggest heart out
of anybody I know.

1:05:52.708 --> 1:05:54.477
And if she hadn't
become a musician,

1:05:54.546 --> 1:05:56.881
I could've imagined her
starting an orphanage.

1:05:56.950 --> 1:05:59.080
Or running for president.

1:05:59.149 --> 1:06:00.912
Or curing cancer.

1:06:02.823 --> 1:06:04.089
If I wasn't with Molly,

1:06:04.158 --> 1:06:06.753
I would marry Annie
in a heartbeat.

1:06:08.164 --> 1:06:11.256
All right, who's ready
to shoot some guns?

1:06:15.098 --> 1:06:16.671
This is mama.

1:06:16.740 --> 1:06:18.930
And this is my stepdad, Ray.

1:06:20.504 --> 1:06:22.274
These are my
brothers and sisters.

1:06:22.342 --> 1:06:25.073
These are my nieces and
nephews, aunt and uncle.

1:06:25.142 --> 1:06:26.040
Say hi everybody.

1:06:26.108 --> 1:06:27.147
Hi.

1:06:28.013 --> 1:06:29.111
Lovely to meet you guys.

1:06:29.180 --> 1:06:30.183
Please don't roll on this.

1:06:30.252 --> 1:06:32.284
No, no, no, get this,
it's gonna be good.

1:06:32.353 --> 1:06:33.888
Okay, I'm serious, this
isn't your real family

1:06:33.957 --> 1:06:36.215
so it's not really
a documentary.

1:06:36.284 --> 1:06:36.954
Oh, hush up.

1:06:37.022 --> 1:06:38.087
I'll be so mad at you

1:06:38.155 --> 1:06:39.951
if you ruin the song.

1:07:10.358 --> 1:07:17.362
with the danger

1:07:20.533 --> 1:07:25.502
in the Year of the Tiger

1:07:27.639 --> 1:07:32.608
in the Year of the Tiger

1:07:34.217 --> 1:07:38.911
in the Year of the Tiger

1:07:42.223 --> 1:07:44.257
-

1:07:48.560 --> 1:07:52.529
can I owe you one

1:08:05.347 --> 1:08:10.185
in the Year of the Tiger

1:08:10.253 --> 1:08:15.289
in the Year of the Tiger

1:08:15.357 --> 1:08:19.986
in the Year of the Tiger

1:08:20.054 --> 1:08:24.622
in the Year of the Tiger

1:08:45.788 --> 1:08:47.886
My famous pecan pie.

1:08:49.952 --> 1:08:51.322
Famous for being the first one
you ever baked.

1:08:51.391 --> 1:08:53.091
Famous in that it won
the blue ribbon

1:08:53.160 --> 1:08:55.727
at the 1998 Texas state fair.

1:08:55.796 --> 1:08:57.323
I bet.

1:08:57.392 --> 1:08:58.326
To Annie's pie.

1:08:58.394 --> 1:09:00.168
To Annie's pie.

1:09:01.961 --> 1:09:02.669
What
y'all waiting for?

1:09:02.737 --> 1:09:03.765
Chow down.

1:09:10.304 --> 1:09:11.344
So good.

1:09:18.479 --> 1:09:19.946
So good.

1:09:42.708 --> 1:09:47.211
I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I can't, I can't.

1:09:47.280 --> 1:09:48.275
Really, great to meet y'all.

1:09:48.343 --> 1:09:49.382
Honestly.

1:09:52.148 --> 1:09:53.188
CB.

1:09:56.350 --> 1:09:57.482
CB.

1:09:57.551 --> 1:09:58.319
Hey, hey, hey.

1:09:58.388 --> 1:09:59.384
Wait, wait, wait.

1:09:59.453 --> 1:10:00.290
What?

1:10:00.359 --> 1:10:02.288
Hey, this is your documentary.

1:10:02.357 --> 1:10:02.991
Is it?

1:10:03.060 --> 1:10:03.930
Yes.

1:10:03.999 --> 1:10:06.394
All of this was your idea.

1:10:06.463 --> 1:10:07.834
None of this was my idea.

1:10:07.903 --> 1:10:09.303
My idea was to make you

1:10:09.371 --> 1:10:11.301
and the film just a
little more interesting,

1:10:11.370 --> 1:10:12.170
but you would still be yourself,

1:10:12.239 --> 1:10:14.302
not playing some stupid role.

1:10:14.371 --> 1:10:15.399
I'm not playing a role.

1:10:15.468 --> 1:10:16.508
Are you?

1:10:18.511 --> 1:10:20.340
Annie, I shouldn't
even be here,

1:10:20.409 --> 1:10:21.447
my dad's sick.

1:10:23.146 --> 1:10:24.175
CB.

1:10:26.579 --> 1:10:27.618
I'm sorry.

1:10:29.859 --> 1:10:31.688
We're in this together.

1:10:34.363 --> 1:10:37.364
I don't want this
to be hard on you.

1:10:39.660 --> 1:10:41.236
But this is who I am.

1:10:43.429 --> 1:10:45.504
Why don't you come on inside,

1:10:45.572 --> 1:10:49.035
partake in a little
Clark family ritual?

1:11:03.418 --> 1:11:08.492
It can be hard when you are
trying to create something new

1:11:08.561 --> 1:11:11.398
and other people
doubt your intentions.

1:11:21.311 --> 1:11:23.645
Here I was zeroing
in on big themes,

1:11:23.713 --> 1:11:24.741
big ideas.

1:11:25.772 --> 1:11:27.143
One more song.

1:11:27.212 --> 1:11:28.581
One more song.

1:11:28.650 --> 1:11:31.709
I had pushed
Annie to the breaking point.

1:11:31.778 --> 1:11:33.178
I guess I didn't realize

1:11:33.247 --> 1:11:36.324
that I had pushed other
people there as well.

1:11:44.296 --> 1:11:46.257
CB, where are we going?

1:11:49.496 --> 1:11:50.536
CB?

1:11:54.568 --> 1:11:55.607
All right.

1:11:56.405 --> 1:11:57.578
Okay.

1:11:57.647 --> 1:11:59.536
Come on.

1:11:59.605 --> 1:12:00.207
Careful.

1:12:00.276 --> 1:12:01.316
Careful.

1:12:05.615 --> 1:12:06.382
I'm not over dressed am I?

1:12:06.450 --> 1:12:08.356
Just a little further.

1:12:09.288 --> 1:12:10.089
Just a little further.

1:12:10.158 --> 1:12:11.450
Careful, careful, careful.

1:12:11.519 --> 1:12:12.418
Okay.

1:12:12.487 --> 1:12:13.526
Okay.

1:12:14.625 --> 1:12:17.288
You can take your blindfold off.

1:12:23.536 --> 1:12:27.241
I thought we could
visit your dad.

1:12:27.310 --> 1:12:29.441
Annie, do you know
how rare it is

1:12:29.509 --> 1:12:32.070
for them to allow
filming inside?

1:12:32.138 --> 1:12:33.611
But they made an
exception for us,

1:12:33.680 --> 1:12:36.582
'cause someone in
there is a huge fan.

1:12:39.653 --> 1:12:43.314
Okay, go ahead and tell
us what you're feeling.

1:12:46.827 --> 1:12:49.563
You wanna go ahead and tell
us what you're thinking?

1:12:49.631 --> 1:12:52.165
I'm thinking I don't know
why the fuck we're here.

1:12:52.234 --> 1:12:53.657
We're here because I feel like

1:12:53.726 --> 1:12:56.567
I can't elicit
anything authentic from
you anymore, okay?

1:12:56.635 --> 1:12:57.669
And I wanted to
get something raw.

1:12:57.738 --> 1:13:00.569
So whatever you're
feeling right now is okay.

1:13:00.638 --> 1:13:01.776
What I'm feeling, that's okay?

1:13:01.844 --> 1:13:03.610
Thank you.

1:13:03.679 --> 1:13:07.444
Seriously,
this is great, just go with it.

1:13:07.513 --> 1:13:09.110
But this is fucking bullshit.

1:13:09.179 --> 1:13:12.578
Annie, this is what we've
been trying to get at,

1:13:12.647 --> 1:13:14.418
dirt, grit.

1:13:14.487 --> 1:13:15.683
I mean nothing basic or boring,

1:13:15.752 --> 1:13:18.018
but also nothing contrived.

1:13:18.087 --> 1:13:21.521
Oh yeah, this feels
very spontaneous.

1:13:21.590 --> 1:13:22.457
Okay, fine.

1:13:22.526 --> 1:13:24.131
I guess, whatever.

1:13:24.200 --> 1:13:25.527
Okay, we don't have to go in.

1:13:25.595 --> 1:13:27.358
We got something real.

1:13:29.403 --> 1:13:30.667
You know what, I'm very aware

1:13:30.735 --> 1:13:33.635
that the world is
full of cruelty,

1:13:33.704 --> 1:13:35.535
and pain and garbage, okay,

1:13:35.604 --> 1:13:36.473
I know that.

1:13:36.542 --> 1:13:39.112
And that's why I make music,

1:13:39.181 --> 1:13:42.714
to get away from... this.

1:13:42.782 --> 1:13:44.714
You can't
make the whole thing up

1:13:44.782 --> 1:13:47.620
and expect people
to buy into it.

1:13:47.689 --> 1:13:51.552
Well then I wanna make
another kind of film.

1:17:35.344 --> 1:17:38.111
and sandwiches

1:17:44.650 --> 1:17:47.757
the burning sand

1:17:58.432 --> 1:18:03.038
and no one wins

1:18:03.107 --> 1:18:08.878
days are spent

1:19:09.603 --> 1:19:13.441
you'd end up here

1:19:13.510 --> 1:19:18.013
for years to see you

1:19:32.727 --> 1:19:37.332
of your mama's tears

1:20:14.975 --> 1:20:17.101
and no one wins

1:20:17.170 --> 1:20:17.869
Cut.

1:20:17.938 --> 1:20:18.938
Cut.

1:20:20.973 --> 1:20:23.749
Hey, CB, I thought that
one was actually really good.

1:20:23.817 --> 1:20:26.847
Yeah, it looked
great, nice job.

1:20:26.916 --> 1:20:27.751
What's wrong?

1:20:27.820 --> 1:20:29.022
Well, it just feels weird

1:20:29.091 --> 1:20:31.955
to watch you perform a song
we wrote together solo.

1:20:32.024 --> 1:20:33.287
Hey, do you guys
have a minute?

1:20:33.356 --> 1:20:34.585
I just wanted to
show you the options

1:20:34.654 --> 1:20:35.790
for the role of
director for tomorrow.

1:20:35.859 --> 1:20:36.793
Oh, perfect.

1:20:36.862 --> 1:20:37.894
CB, I hope you don't mind,

1:20:37.963 --> 1:20:39.565
but I asked Kayla to help us out

1:20:39.634 --> 1:20:41.064
with casting the director.

1:20:41.132 --> 1:20:42.529
Honestly, I would
have asked you,

1:20:42.597 --> 1:20:44.532
but you were so busy
with your shot list.

1:20:44.601 --> 1:20:46.867
I thought you wanted me
to be in the narrative film.

1:20:46.936 --> 1:20:48.205
Oh, no, I do,

1:20:48.273 --> 1:20:51.076
just, you know, played
by some exquisite.

1:20:55.783 --> 1:20:58.050
You're fired as my assistant.

1:21:00.020 --> 1:21:03.550
Oh, no, I don't
think you can fire me,

1:21:03.619 --> 1:21:05.086
'cause I've just been
playing your assistant.

1:21:05.155 --> 1:21:07.092
You know, like I'm an actor.

1:21:09.465 --> 1:21:11.030
Wait, I'm confused.

1:21:12.129 --> 1:21:14.631
I thought that Annie hired you.

1:21:19.173 --> 1:21:22.833
I don't think I know
what we're doing anymore.

1:21:34.487 --> 1:21:35.516
Dad?

1:21:37.583 --> 1:21:39.553
Are you a part of this, too?

1:21:40.823 --> 1:21:42.026
Guilty.

1:21:42.095 --> 1:21:43.762
Wait, does that
mean you're not sick?

1:21:43.831 --> 1:21:44.994
No, no, no, no, I'm very sick,

1:21:45.063 --> 1:21:49.270
it's just I'm not your dad.

1:22:11.254 --> 1:22:13.884
CB, what don't you understand?

1:22:40.322 --> 1:22:41.351
Get in.

1:23:13.990 --> 1:23:17.689
I'm sorry, I felt
really out of it.

1:23:17.758 --> 1:23:19.549
Maybe you're just tired.

1:23:19.618 --> 1:23:22.557
No, I feel out of control.

1:23:26.164 --> 1:23:28.233
I feel completely subsumed.

1:23:29.798 --> 1:23:32.400
It always takes sacrifice
to create something.

1:23:32.469 --> 1:23:34.133
Can we have a
normal conversation?

1:23:34.201 --> 1:23:35.068
Of course.

1:23:35.137 --> 1:23:36.940
What is this?

1:23:37.008 --> 1:23:39.072
Who else would we be?

1:23:39.141 --> 1:23:40.179
I'm not sure.

1:23:41.443 --> 1:23:43.109
I don't know who
you are anymore.

1:23:43.178 --> 1:23:44.744
I know who I am.

1:23:44.813 --> 1:23:48.220
What does it matter
if anybody else does?

1:23:48.288 --> 1:23:51.150
What story did you think
we were trying to tell?

1:23:51.219 --> 1:23:52.482
Your story.

1:23:52.551 --> 1:23:53.984
This is my story.

1:23:55.562 --> 1:23:58.257
I thought the point was for
people to get to know you.

1:23:58.326 --> 1:24:00.595
And now they will.

1:24:00.663 --> 1:24:04.665
CB, are you sure it's me
you can no longer find?

1:24:13.241 --> 1:24:14.239
Stop the car.

1:24:14.308 --> 1:24:15.346
Stop the car.

1:25:33.795 --> 1:25:35.094
Don't get me wrong,

1:25:35.163 --> 1:25:37.923
I do feel bad about
what happened.

1:25:39.166 --> 1:25:40.063
And it's a shame
we'll never finish

1:25:40.132 --> 1:25:42.092
the movie that we started,

1:25:43.333 --> 1:25:44.265
but I think she lost sight

1:25:44.333 --> 1:25:46.096
of what we were doing,

1:25:47.743 --> 1:25:49.176
whereas I never did.

1:25:55.348 --> 1:25:59.514
and no one wins

1:25:59.583 --> 1:26:03.088
days are spent

1:26:26.381 --> 1:26:32.318
where are you now

1:26:32.387 --> 1:26:37.389
where are you now

1:26:40.362 --> 1:26:45.364
where are you now

1:26:48.401 --> 1:26:53.163
where are you

1:28:13.653 --> 1:28:18.750
doesn't change dies

1:28:24.498 --> 1:28:29.501
on this ride
