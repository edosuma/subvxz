01:46.633 --> 01:49.266
- In Oz, you have to be
ready to defend yourself

01:49.333 --> 01:51.033
at any given moment.

01:51.100 --> 01:53.433
Chances are the person
coming at you has a weapon,

01:53.500 --> 01:55.233
so you gotta have one too.

01:55.300 --> 01:58.467
You've got to be ready
to kill your enemies,

01:58.533 --> 02:00.333
or at least
slow them down.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.400
- You told me if I let you
out of Solitary,

02:02.467 --> 02:03.467
you'd snitch on
the other prisoners,

02:03.533 --> 02:05.033
be my informant.

02:05.100 --> 02:07.500
Well, you haven't told me
anything I don't already know.

02:07.567 --> 02:10.133
- Morales won't let me
back into El Norte

02:10.200 --> 02:11.800
unless I kill Redding.

02:11.867 --> 02:14.100
- Then you're fucked, Alvarez,
and no use to me.

02:14.166 --> 02:16.800
Hell, I might as well send you
back to Solitary right now.

02:16.867 --> 02:18.033
- Wait a second.
He tells me

02:18.100 --> 02:19.333
to grease somebody, right?

02:19.400 --> 02:20.834
There's conspiracy, man.

02:20.900 --> 02:23.967
- I convict Morales on
a conspiracy charge, so what?

02:24.033 --> 02:26.400
He's still in Oz,
still running drugs.

02:26.467 --> 02:27.867
- Give me a couple days,

02:27.934 --> 02:29.800
I'll try to figure out
some other way

02:29.867 --> 02:31.533
to get in his good graces.

02:32.433 --> 02:34.600
Just a couple
of fucking days.

02:37.934 --> 02:39.700
- Miguel, Miguel,
where you been?

02:41.233 --> 02:43.600
- I was kissing
the Warden's ass.

02:43.667 --> 02:45.900
- That's funny.

02:45.967 --> 02:47.567
- Not as funny as you think.

02:48.834 --> 02:50.333
You know he wants me
to rat on you.

02:51.667 --> 02:55.867
Says if I don't give him any
inside info on drugs and shit,

02:55.934 --> 02:58.066
I'm gonna be playing
Solitaire again.

02:59.333 --> 03:01.433
So I've been thinking.

03:01.500 --> 03:04.500
You know, maybe
I could be like a...

03:04.567 --> 03:07.734
double agent, right?

03:07.800 --> 03:09.333
I just give him
the information

03:09.400 --> 03:11.333
that you want him
to have, you know.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.967
- That's a brilliant idea.
- Think so?

03:14.033 --> 03:15.834
- Except for the fact that
there ain't no information

03:15.900 --> 03:17.166
I want Glynn to have.

03:17.233 --> 03:19.000
- Misinformation.

03:19.066 --> 03:20.800
- You tell him stuff that
turns out not to be true,

03:20.867 --> 03:22.266
how long's
he gonna trust you?

03:22.333 --> 03:24.800
No, my friend...

03:24.867 --> 03:27.433
if I were you--
and I'm glad I'm not--

03:27.500 --> 03:30.967
I'd prepare myself
for the inevitable,

03:31.033 --> 03:34.133
spending the next 50 years
all by your lonesome.

03:39.400 --> 03:40.700
- Yo.
- Yeah, what's up?

03:40.767 --> 03:42.133
What you want, Alvarez?

03:42.200 --> 03:43.600
- I want to talk
to your boss.

03:43.667 --> 03:45.900
- We got no business
with you.

03:49.033 --> 03:50.633
- Morales wants
you dead, man.

03:50.700 --> 03:52.300
-  That ain't
no headline.

03:52.367 --> 03:53.800
- He's ordered me
to do the deed.

03:54.633 --> 03:56.433
- I see.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.200
- I don't want to have
to spill any more blood

03:58.266 --> 03:59.667
than I already done, man.

03:59.734 --> 04:01.934
- I still don't see
what it is you want.

04:04.266 --> 04:07.033
- I wanna help you
take out Morales.

04:07.100 --> 04:09.066
- You're playing
a dangerous game, son,

04:09.133 --> 04:10.567
betraying your own skin.

04:10.633 --> 04:14.166
- Hey, they betrayed me
first, man.

04:14.233 --> 04:16.033
- No doubt.

04:16.100 --> 04:18.266
But the trouble with getting
in bed with a traitor is

04:18.333 --> 04:20.433
you never know when
he might betray you.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.600
I appreciate your offer,

04:22.667 --> 04:24.934
but we're gonna have to decline.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.667
- Decline.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.834
- What you talking
to Redding for?

04:36.900 --> 04:39.133
- I asked to borrow
some detergent.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.734
- Yeah?

04:40.800 --> 04:43.266
Well, we haven't forgotten
that you shanked Carlo Ricardo.

04:46.166 --> 04:47.533
- So?
- When Chico Guerra

04:47.600 --> 04:50.000
gets out of the hospital,

04:50.066 --> 04:52.166
he and me are
gonna fuck you up.

04:52.233 --> 04:54.433
- Why wait till
he gets out, chicken shit?

04:54.500 --> 04:56.300
Come on, baby.

04:56.367 --> 04:59.066
I ain't got nothing, man.

04:59.133 --> 05:02.100
Nothing to lose,
nothing to gain.

05:02.166 --> 05:04.166
Let's do this, puto.

05:04.233 --> 05:06.233
- Yo, yo, yo!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh!

05:16.266 --> 05:17.367
- Go! Fuck him up!

05:19.100 --> 05:21.100
- Oh!

05:35.600 --> 05:39.533
- Now, this shank, which
we call the Gillette bayonet,

05:39.600 --> 05:42.900
is not designed to pierce
but to slice.

05:44.166 --> 05:45.967
The blade
of a disposable razor

05:46.033 --> 05:48.100
is extracted
from its plastic casing

05:48.166 --> 05:51.633
and then attached
to a pen or a pencil.

05:51.700 --> 05:54.934
Only, the danger
with this sucker is--

05:55.000 --> 05:56.633
Ah!

05:56.700 --> 05:59.066
Ahh. You end up
cutting yourself.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.900
- Busmalis is in solitary
confinement, Norma.

07:06.967 --> 07:08.367
- Why?

07:08.433 --> 07:10.233
- In order to get
permission to marry you,

07:10.300 --> 07:14.133
Busmalis promised the warden
he wouldn't dig anymore tunnels.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.734
Only he'd already
started a tunnel.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.967
When he tried
to fill it up...

07:18.800 --> 07:21.467
Well, all hell
broke loose.

07:24.333 --> 07:27.000
- How long will Agamemnon
be isolated?

07:27.066 --> 07:28.400
- Hard to say.

07:28.467 --> 07:30.700
Let me see what
I can do on my end.

07:30.767 --> 07:32.667
- Thank you, Mr. Rebadow.

07:32.734 --> 07:34.934
I miss Agamemnon so much.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.233
- Yes.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.200
I miss him too.

07:41.700 --> 07:45.867
- So, the truth is, Busmalis
started digging the tunnel

07:45.934 --> 07:47.867
before he agreed not to.

07:47.934 --> 07:49.066
- It's a lovely story,
Rebadow,

07:49.133 --> 07:51.066
but why should
I believe you?

07:52.333 --> 07:54.567
- Because you know me, Warden.

07:54.633 --> 07:56.600
I've been in Oz
for 35 years.

07:56.667 --> 08:00.200
I've seen murders, riots,

08:00.266 --> 08:02.767
had 100 different cellmates.

08:02.834 --> 08:05.934
Not once have I stepped up

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
on another person's behalf.

08:08.066 --> 08:12.133
I've survived
by being uninvolved.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.967
Busmalis deserves better.

08:19.834 --> 08:21.867
Okay.

08:21.934 --> 08:25.834
But no more
goddamn tunnels!

08:29.567 --> 08:32.300
- I don't know how you got me
out or how I'll ever repay you.

08:32.367 --> 08:34.367
- Nonsense.
I owed you.

08:37.667 --> 08:39.300
Busmalis...

08:42.367 --> 08:44.066
No more tunnels.

08:44.133 --> 08:45.867
- Absolutely.

08:46.900 --> 08:50.700
In solitary, I had time to think
about my obsession with digging.

08:50.767 --> 08:53.633
Tunnels are nothing
but extended graves.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.700
But I'm not dead.
Far from it.

08:56.767 --> 08:59.967
- Because of Norma, you have
every reason to live.

09:01.867 --> 09:03.667
- I'm gonna go call Norma.

09:09.533 --> 09:12.600
- Now, the Weigert Corporation
has developed a pill

09:12.667 --> 09:15.967
which causes the body to age
at a faster pace than normal.

09:16.033 --> 09:18.200
So we give this drug
to a prisoner,

09:18.266 --> 09:21.533
he ages the number of years that
he was supposed to have served,

09:21.600 --> 09:23.000
and then we let him go.

09:23.066 --> 09:24.700
But that whole
fucking process

09:24.767 --> 09:27.567
invalidates the whole
purpose of our jobs.

09:27.633 --> 09:29.533
- Tim's right.
You take a killer at 20,

09:29.600 --> 09:31.000
who's in for 20,

09:31.066 --> 09:32.533
you give him the pill,
bingo, he's 40,

09:32.600 --> 09:34.467
but he's still
a cold-blooded murderer.

09:34.533 --> 09:36.834
- This drug doesn't
factor in rehabilitation.

09:36.900 --> 09:39.734
This drug is the ultimate
admission of our failure.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.533
It says that we can't
redeem these men

09:41.600 --> 09:42.867
and we shouldn't even try.

09:42.934 --> 09:46.100
We've gotta pull the plug
on this project now.

09:46.166 --> 09:48.200
- Leave it to you, Tim,
to turn a personal disagreement

09:48.266 --> 09:50.800
between us into some
self-righteous crusade.

09:50.867 --> 09:52.300
He's making speeches

09:52.367 --> 09:53.867
because he didn't want
the O'Reily brothers included.

09:53.934 --> 09:55.800
- Regardless, he's brought up
some valid points.

09:55.867 --> 09:57.567
- Peter Marie--
- I'm sorry, he has.

09:57.633 --> 09:59.100
- Valid points?

09:59.166 --> 10:01.200
Which of you can
stand up and claim

10:01.266 --> 10:04.033
that you've actually turned
one of these fucks around?

10:04.100 --> 10:05.400
- True.

10:05.467 --> 10:06.934
All we do is move 'em
through the system.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.233
We bring 'em in, we lock 'em up,
we let 'em out.

10:09.300 --> 10:11.600
At least with this pill we don't
get stabbed in the process.

10:11.667 --> 10:13.633
- If you're so afraid
it'll work, Lopresti,

10:13.700 --> 10:15.700
go back to selling used cars.

10:15.767 --> 10:17.033
- You see?
- Don't be an asshole.

10:17.100 --> 10:18.300
- Yeah.
- This isn't just about me.

10:18.367 --> 10:19.433
- Now, wait a minute,
you instigated this.

10:19.500 --> 10:20.934
- Enough!

10:21.000 --> 10:23.600
I'll call the Commissioner
and express your concerns.

10:23.667 --> 10:26.133
But until he decides
to yank the plug,

10:26.200 --> 10:28.000
the program continues.

10:28.066 --> 10:29.433
That's all.

10:38.266 --> 10:39.533
- Let me ask
you something.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.400
This new drug
that we're testing,

10:41.467 --> 10:43.400
how long until we start
feeling the effects?

10:43.467 --> 10:44.600
- Well, as I said before,

10:44.667 --> 10:45.934
it's never been
tested on humans,

10:46.000 --> 10:49.066
but the lab rats began
to age in about three days.

10:49.133 --> 10:51.900
- If I get old and wrinkled,

10:51.967 --> 10:53.166
will you still love me?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.567
Next.

11:02.166 --> 11:04.600
Cyril, any complaints?

11:04.667 --> 11:06.166
- I have a tummy-ache.

11:06.233 --> 11:07.500
- Come on, sit down.

11:12.066 --> 11:13.867
Okay, take a deep breath.

11:24.700 --> 11:25.967
- Count!

11:35.934 --> 11:38.100
Ah. Cyril, come on,
let's go.

11:41.233 --> 11:43.000
Come on, Cyril, get up.

11:47.867 --> 11:49.934
Holy mother of Christ.

11:53.667 --> 11:57.800
- Ryan...I don't feel too good.

12:00.667 --> 12:02.133
- Be right back.

12:05.300 --> 12:08.533
- Hey, so?
- He's begun to age.

12:08.600 --> 12:09.900
- What about me?

12:09.967 --> 12:12.266
- Your body might
metabolize slower

12:12.333 --> 12:13.567
or you could be
on the placebo.

12:13.633 --> 12:15.500
- Whoa, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

12:15.567 --> 12:17.266
The idea was for me and Cyril
to go through this together.

12:17.333 --> 12:20.033
Remember? To get out
of Oz together.

12:20.100 --> 12:21.400
Are you trying
to tell me he--

12:21.467 --> 12:23.800
he's gonna get old
and I might not?

12:23.867 --> 12:25.133
- Yes.
- No, you stop

12:25.200 --> 12:26.133
giving him that drug.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.166
- No, I won't.

12:27.233 --> 12:28.200
You both agreed to take it.

12:28.266 --> 12:29.734
- Well, now, I'm unagreeing.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.700
Look, everything I've done
has fucked up Cyril's life.

12:31.767 --> 12:34.233
I'm not about to sit by
and watch him disintegrate.

12:34.300 --> 12:35.834
- You signed an agreement.

12:35.900 --> 12:37.667
- I don't care.
- Well, I do.

12:38.667 --> 12:40.233
- Fuck you.

12:40.300 --> 12:42.100
Cyril, put your shirt on.
We're leaving.

12:42.166 --> 12:44.266
- No, we're keeping Cyril
here a few more hours

12:44.333 --> 12:46.033
for observation.
Get him out of here.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.233
- Okay, you see
my brother's hair?

12:57.300 --> 12:58.600
- Pretty bizarre.

12:58.667 --> 13:00.066
- This aging thing is
out of whack, Beecher.

13:00.133 --> 13:01.500
You and me,
we gotta drop out.

13:01.567 --> 13:03.166
We gotta talk to Robson
and Kirk and the others

13:03.233 --> 13:04.767
and we gotta get them
to drop out too.

13:04.834 --> 13:06.000
What?

13:07.033 --> 13:08.900
- This is just like you,
O'Reily.

13:08.967 --> 13:11.100
I gave my word,
and as terrified as I am

13:11.166 --> 13:13.667
about the effects of the drug,
I'm sticking with it.

13:13.734 --> 13:14.800
- Fine.

13:14.867 --> 13:16.500
I'll talk to
the others myself.

13:16.567 --> 13:19.367
- Yeah, well, I don't know
if that's gonna do much good.

13:19.433 --> 13:20.800
Mugs like Robson,
Hoyt, and Wick,

13:20.867 --> 13:22.133
they're used to playing
Russian roulette

13:22.200 --> 13:23.533
with their lives.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.400
My guess is they're gonna
laugh in your face.

13:26.967 --> 13:28.667
- You feeling good today?

13:28.734 --> 13:30.400
- I'm feeling nervous.
It's a lot of money.

13:30.467 --> 13:32.433
- Well, helping you out
is none other than

13:32.500 --> 13:35.867
the host of the very popular
"Miss Sally's Schoolyard,"

13:35.934 --> 13:37.934
Whitney Allen.
Whitney, welcome.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.133
Well, let's play the game...

13:39.200 --> 13:40.967
- Dr. Nathan says
I got pubic lice.

13:41.033 --> 13:42.934
Tiny little bugs that
live around in my balls.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.667
- Shit.

13:49.233 --> 13:52.166
- Wow. That's freaky.

13:52.233 --> 13:54.567
His hair turning white.

13:54.633 --> 13:57.166
- Yeah, at least that shit
won't happen to us.

13:57.233 --> 13:59.266
- Other than the lice,
I feel great.

13:59.333 --> 14:01.734
Thinking maybe I'm one of
the five that got the placebo.

14:05.700 --> 14:08.000
- Wick, what are you doing?

14:08.066 --> 14:09.166
Wick?

14:10.233 --> 14:11.834
Jesus fucking Christ!

14:11.900 --> 14:14.900
Murphy! Murphy!

14:14.967 --> 14:17.100
Get some fucking help
down here!

14:26.367 --> 14:27.834
- Gloria.

14:27.900 --> 14:30.667
Come to gloat, Tim?

14:30.734 --> 14:32.367
- No, to apologize.

14:32.433 --> 14:33.600
I mean, you were
right on the money

14:33.667 --> 14:35.033
when you said that
I turned our disagreement

14:35.100 --> 14:37.600
into something else.

14:37.667 --> 14:39.867
I'm sure you were acting out
on the best of intentions.

14:41.700 --> 14:43.400
- Was I?

14:44.333 --> 14:46.367
My answer to everything
that walks through that door

14:46.433 --> 14:48.734
is pop a pill in his mouth.

14:50.667 --> 14:52.033
I don't even try
to heal people anymore.

14:52.100 --> 14:54.033
I'm a drug dealer.

14:55.667 --> 14:58.066
- Well, better that
than a, uh...

15:00.633 --> 15:03.834
Fuck, I don't even know
what I am anymore,

15:03.900 --> 15:05.467
except tired and hungry.

15:06.934 --> 15:09.066
Good night.

15:10.734 --> 15:12.800
- Tim.

15:12.867 --> 15:14.066
- Yeah?

15:16.867 --> 15:19.133
- That rain check
for dinner?

15:20.367 --> 15:22.000
I'd like to cash it in.

15:22.066 --> 15:23.333
- Really? You sure?

15:23.400 --> 15:24.667
- Yeah.

15:26.767 --> 15:28.367
I don't want to be
alone tonight.

15:40.400 --> 15:43.300
- Remember when we were little?

15:43.367 --> 15:45.667
Mama would sing to us.

15:45.734 --> 15:47.367
- Just try and sleep, Cyril.

15:49.266 --> 15:52.000
- I can't remember what song.

16:03.633 --> 16:04.867
Move over.

16:09.233 --> 16:13.567
♪ Over in Killarney ♪

16:13.633 --> 16:16.333

17:22.000 --> 17:24.300
- And I'm sure we all feel
enormous sense of joy

17:24.367 --> 17:26.734
watching our brother embrace
the wings of Islam.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.500
And so henceforth,

17:29.567 --> 17:33.667
he will no longer be known
as Leroy Tidd

17:33.734 --> 17:37.200
but as Salah Yudin,

17:37.266 --> 17:41.233
which means
"honoring the faith."

17:42.700 --> 17:44.333
Allahu akbar.

17:44.400 --> 17:45.767
all: Allahu akbar.

17:45.834 --> 17:48.667
Welcome, my brother.

18:02.700 --> 18:05.467
- Imam, there are things
I want to talk to you about,

18:05.533 --> 18:08.533
but I'm afraid.
- Well, don't be, my brother.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.633
From now on, you must feel
free to ask me anything.

18:11.700 --> 18:13.300
- Even about Adebisi?

18:18.800 --> 18:21.367
He was a bad man,
but he was my friend.

18:23.100 --> 18:24.266
You plotted to murder him.

18:24.333 --> 18:26.333
- No.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.467
His death was never my goal.

18:31.233 --> 18:32.467
I tried to save him.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.133
But Simon didn't
want to be saved.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.633
He felt he knew what
he needed from life.

18:39.934 --> 18:42.133
After he'd satisfied
all of his appetites,

18:42.200 --> 18:44.200
realized that
his desires were empty,

18:44.266 --> 18:47.166
that he had nothing,

18:47.233 --> 18:50.166
the only desire that
he had left was to die.

18:50.233 --> 18:52.967
- How do you know that?

18:53.033 --> 18:57.500
- You only need to look
into a man's face

18:57.567 --> 19:00.367
to see if his time has come.

19:13.800 --> 19:16.100
- Hello, Leroy.

19:16.166 --> 19:17.333
Thought we had a deal.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.367
Thought you were gonna
kill Said for us.

19:19.433 --> 19:21.967
- I will.
- When?

19:22.033 --> 19:23.967
- He's constantly
surrounded by his crew.

19:24.033 --> 19:25.800
I'm waiting for a moment
when I got him alone.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.333
As-salaam alaikum.

19:29.400 --> 19:30.633
- Walaikum Salaam.

19:30.700 --> 19:31.800
- What's going on?

19:31.867 --> 19:33.500
- Said's napping.

19:33.567 --> 19:35.266
You know he suffers from
hypertension, right?

19:35.333 --> 19:36.433
- No, I didn't.

19:36.500 --> 19:37.700
You want a break?

19:37.767 --> 19:39.133
I'd be happy to take over.

19:40.333 --> 19:42.166
- I do have to take a leak.

19:42.233 --> 19:44.667
- Then relieve thyself.

19:44.734 --> 19:46.367
- Okay.

19:46.433 --> 19:47.867
He should be asleep
for another 20 minutes.

19:47.934 --> 19:49.567
I'll be right back.
- Mm-hmm.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.166
- Salah?

20:23.333 --> 20:25.300
Where--
- It's all right.

20:26.333 --> 20:27.533
You're safe.

20:40.266 --> 20:43.033
- Ah, God!
What the fuck?

20:46.467 --> 20:48.467
- You know, I'm getting tired
of your boy Redding, man,

20:48.533 --> 20:51.500
waiting to make his move against
Pancamo and Morales, man.

20:51.567 --> 20:53.233
I mean, shit, I don't know why
we don't just go up there

20:53.300 --> 20:54.867
and ice the motherfuckers
right now.

20:54.934 --> 20:57.000
- Relax.
Red knows the score.

20:57.066 --> 20:59.033
He'll tell us when
the time is right.

21:00.433 --> 21:01.700
Yo...

21:01.767 --> 21:04.467
That--that's not who
I think it is, is it?

21:04.533 --> 21:06.533
Jackson Vahue?
- Yeah, that's him, yo.

21:06.600 --> 21:08.500
- Get the fuck out of here.

21:08.567 --> 21:09.834
I heard he was up in here,

21:09.900 --> 21:11.533
man, but you know,
I ain't seen him.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.834
- He like to keep
a low profile.

21:13.900 --> 21:15.734
You know.
- Hey, I want to meet him.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.333
- Yeah, yeah,
come on, man.

21:17.400 --> 21:19.967
Jackson, yo, Jackson.

21:20.033 --> 21:22.033
- What's up, man?

21:22.100 --> 21:23.567
All right, all right.

21:23.633 --> 21:25.333
How you doing?
- I'm good, you know?

21:25.400 --> 21:26.800
- My man Omar White, B.

21:26.867 --> 21:28.300
- Oh, hey.
- He wanted to meet you.

21:28.367 --> 21:30.633
- What's up, man? Yeah.

21:30.700 --> 21:32.667
Yo, hey, I was there that night,
man, when you scored, what?

21:32.734 --> 21:35.000
48 points on the Bulls, boy.

21:35.066 --> 21:37.266
That was--
- Poet, what you got in stock?

21:37.333 --> 21:39.133
- I thought you was
off the drugs, man.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.734
- Yeah, well, that was when
I was trying to win parole.

21:43.300 --> 21:46.133
Now, I'm stuck in this shithole
for another seven years.

21:47.166 --> 21:48.467
Gimme some tit.

21:48.533 --> 21:49.867
- Anything you need,
brother.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.100
We got that for you.
- Yeah.

21:51.166 --> 21:53.100
- All right, dog.

21:53.166 --> 21:55.133
- Aw, keep you happy.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.300
Keep your motor running.

21:56.367 --> 21:59.400
- I'm your man, Jackson.

22:03.200 --> 22:04.700
- Man, boy,
Jackson Vahue, man.

22:04.767 --> 22:06.300
I mean, there I am, man.
I'm up there

22:06.367 --> 22:07.567
trying to be all friendly
with this motherfucker,

22:07.633 --> 22:08.900
he's looking at me
like I'm not even there,

22:08.967 --> 22:11.000
like I'm a fucking glass
of water or something.

22:11.066 --> 22:13.700
- Man, he got other shit
on his mind, man.

22:13.767 --> 22:14.934
- I got this problem.

22:15.033 --> 22:17.533
I just--I just don't
impress people.

22:18.834 --> 22:20.000
- No, man, this ain't
no joke, man.

22:20.066 --> 22:21.633
I mean, ever since
I was a kid, man,

22:21.700 --> 22:23.233
I meet people, man, I just--

22:23.300 --> 22:26.400
for some reason I just don't
leave no impression on them.

22:27.500 --> 22:29.000
- What you gonna do, man?

22:29.066 --> 22:30.800
- What am I do?

22:30.867 --> 22:33.066
I'll show you what I'ma do.

22:33.133 --> 22:34.600
I'm gonna make
these motherfuckers

22:34.667 --> 22:35.834
notice me, all right?

22:35.900 --> 22:37.700
- Yo, don't be waving
that shit around, man.

22:37.767 --> 22:39.500
- These motherfuckers are
gonna fear me, all right?

22:39.567 --> 22:41.233
Watch me, watch me.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.767
- Hey, get the fuck
out of the way.

22:56.233 --> 22:58.266
- McManus.

22:58.333 --> 23:00.000
McManus!
- Yeah?

23:00.066 --> 23:02.233
Ohh! Ah!

23:07.700 --> 23:10.000
- Central, this is 11.
We got a 66, hurry!

23:11.633 --> 23:12.934
- Apply pressure,
Raise his head!

23:13.000 --> 23:14.667
- Bleeding like, a pig, McManus.

23:14.734 --> 23:16.967
How does it feel, baby?
- Ah, fuck!

23:29.667 --> 23:31.467
- It's gonna be okay.

23:31.533 --> 23:34.367
- This particular shank
is called a blunt.

23:34.433 --> 23:36.367
It's fairly standard.

23:36.433 --> 23:39.834
A prisoner palms a hunk of metal
working in the shop

23:39.900 --> 23:42.200
and then rubs the metal
against a stone wall--

23:42.266 --> 23:44.533
in Oz, we got plenty
of those--

23:44.600 --> 23:46.800
shaping it into a blade.

23:47.934 --> 23:50.734
The beauty of this baby
is that

23:50.800 --> 23:52.800
it causes as much
internal damage

23:52.867 --> 23:54.433
as possible.

23:58.233 --> 24:00.467
- Basil, you got a guest.

24:00.533 --> 24:02.066
- Who?

24:02.133 --> 24:03.633
- Nancy Mears.

24:07.166 --> 24:08.633
- That's your mistress?

24:10.567 --> 24:12.333
- Sort of.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.934
She was my partner.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.700
While I was undercover
in Em City,

24:16.767 --> 24:19.367
she pretended
to be my girlfriend.

24:19.433 --> 24:21.500
- You seem surprised
she's here.

24:21.567 --> 24:23.433
- I am.

24:23.500 --> 24:26.700
Up till today
she's refused to see me.

24:32.066 --> 24:33.700
Nancy.

24:35.233 --> 24:37.467
I can't tell you how happy
I am that you've come.

24:38.633 --> 24:40.266
- The Lieutenant ordered me.

24:40.333 --> 24:42.133
- What?

24:42.200 --> 24:45.767
- Schmand.
He said I had to come.

24:45.834 --> 24:50.467
- Oh. Well, I'm sorry
he forced you.

24:50.533 --> 24:52.400
- You had something
to tell me?

24:55.166 --> 24:56.900
- I wanted to apologize

24:56.967 --> 24:59.700
for lying to you
while I was undercover.

24:59.767 --> 25:01.667
I got so deep
inside Desmond Mobay

25:01.734 --> 25:04.700
that I let
the situation get funky.

25:06.667 --> 25:07.700
- Okay.

25:10.266 --> 25:11.367
Bye.

25:11.433 --> 25:14.000
- Nancy, that's it?

25:14.066 --> 25:15.166
Okay, bye?

25:15.233 --> 25:17.166
- What do you want
from me, John?

25:18.567 --> 25:19.700
- Forgiveness.

25:21.133 --> 25:23.467
- Look,

25:23.533 --> 25:25.967
being a cop sucks.

25:26.033 --> 25:27.834
The people we're supposed
to protect and serve,

25:27.900 --> 25:30.400
they think we're brutal,
indifferent,

25:30.467 --> 25:32.567
insulated, and corrupt.

25:32.633 --> 25:34.367
Every day I fight
against that image

25:34.433 --> 25:37.633
and every day a scumbag
like you fucks it up.

25:37.700 --> 25:40.166
So, no, John,
I will not forgive you.

25:40.233 --> 25:42.633
But I promise you this,
I'll forget you.

25:42.700 --> 25:44.433
I will forget
you ever existed.

25:47.633 --> 25:50.400
And if Schmand asks, be sure
to tell him I was here.

25:56.033 --> 25:57.667
- Hey, Hughes!

25:57.734 --> 25:59.333
Wanna play some cards?

25:59.400 --> 26:02.900
- Not with you.

26:02.967 --> 26:04.867
Mm, mm, mm.

26:06.934 --> 26:09.433
When are you gonna
accept the fact

26:09.500 --> 26:13.233
that you, me, and Johnny
share a bond.

26:13.300 --> 26:15.433
We were all cops.

26:15.500 --> 26:19.333
Cops who, for one reason
or another, copped out.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.800
- I have nothing
in common with you.

26:21.867 --> 26:23.000
I'm a political prisoner

26:23.066 --> 26:25.400
incarcerated
by an unjust system.

26:25.467 --> 26:26.867
- No, son.

26:26.934 --> 26:29.266
You're nothing,
but a punk with bad aim.

26:30.633 --> 26:32.133
- And you're a dead man.

26:36.533 --> 26:38.233
- That a threat?

26:38.300 --> 26:39.867
- It ain't a valentine.

26:41.834 --> 26:44.367
- Like I said...

26:44.433 --> 26:45.467
punk.

27:00.633 --> 27:01.834
- Quit staring.

27:03.934 --> 27:06.033
- Relax.
- Cocksucker keeps staring at me

27:06.100 --> 27:08.433
like he's putting
some kind of curse on me.

27:09.266 --> 27:11.367
- Warden wants to see you.
Come on.

27:18.900 --> 27:20.266
- I wonder what
that's about.

27:21.333 --> 27:25.600
- Morales and Pancamo
killed Bian Yixhue.

27:25.667 --> 27:27.333
- Do you have proof?

27:29.233 --> 27:32.233
Well, then unfortunately
there's not much I can do.

27:32.300 --> 27:34.333
- We wanted to see you,
Gongjin,

27:34.400 --> 27:36.166
so that you can
prepare the others.

27:36.233 --> 27:37.700
- To return home?

27:37.767 --> 27:40.200
- No, this is about
Jia Kenmin.

27:40.266 --> 27:42.800
- Jia Kenmin?
You have captured him?

27:42.867 --> 27:45.333
- Yes, he was already on trial
locally for drug charges.

27:45.400 --> 27:47.200
Yesterday, the jury
found him guilty.

27:47.266 --> 27:48.800
- He'll be tried again
in federal court

27:48.867 --> 27:50.367
for illegally bringing
you and the others

27:50.433 --> 27:51.867
into the country.

27:51.934 --> 27:54.233
But in the interim,
he's coming here.

27:54.300 --> 27:56.133
- To this prison?

27:56.200 --> 27:58.600
- Yes, and we're gonna keep him
completely segregated

27:58.667 --> 28:00.467
until your people are gone.

28:01.300 --> 28:05.333
- Jia Kenmin, he is
to blame for the misery.

28:05.400 --> 28:08.567
He arranged for the boat
that brought us from China.

28:08.633 --> 28:10.967
- Yes, and he'll be
punished accordingly.

28:12.166 --> 28:14.166
- I would like to meet him

28:14.233 --> 28:15.533
to see his face.

28:15.600 --> 28:20.600
- Gongjin--
- Please, I will do him no harm.

28:20.667 --> 28:22.300
What harm could I do?

28:23.467 --> 28:25.567
He is a killer.

28:25.633 --> 28:26.867
I am not.

28:45.867 --> 28:50.934
- Prisoner number 01J813,
Jia Kenmin.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.633
Convicted
February 2nd, 2001,

28:54.700 --> 28:58.300
Possession and distribution
of a controlled substance.

28:58.367 --> 29:01.533
Sentence: 15 years,

29:01.600 --> 29:04.333
up for parole in five.

29:14.867 --> 29:17.667
- Kuang Gongjin, Jia Kenmin.

29:18.433 --> 29:20.734
- How you doing?
- No physical contact.

29:20.800 --> 29:21.834
Sit.

29:24.333 --> 29:25.834
The officer's gonna
remain in the room

29:25.900 --> 29:27.500
for the entire
five minutes

29:27.567 --> 29:30.734
and can shut the conversation
down any time before that.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.100
Okay?

29:40.600 --> 29:41.834
- So?

29:43.467 --> 29:45.900
- I am told your parents

29:45.967 --> 29:48.333
left China same as us.

29:50.166 --> 29:51.934
Escaped the horrors

29:52.000 --> 29:54.266
to make a better life
for you.

29:54.333 --> 29:57.967
So, how can you treat
your own people like dirt?

29:59.166 --> 30:01.133
I want to kill you.

30:03.266 --> 30:07.133
But killing you will not bring
Yixhue back to his wife and son.

30:08.600 --> 30:12.266
The men in this prison
are not honorable.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.033
Are you?

30:16.100 --> 30:18.834
Are you, Jia Kenmin?

30:18.900 --> 30:24.333
If so, there is one thing you
could do to make up for the bad.

30:26.467 --> 30:30.967
One thing I ask,
not only for myself,

30:31.033 --> 30:34.633
but for the honor
of all who suffer.

30:39.967 --> 30:44.000
Enrique Morales.

30:46.600 --> 30:47.900
Will you do that?

30:50.133 --> 30:52.166
Will you swear?

31:03.567 --> 31:05.467
- The State Department,
under increasing pressure

31:05.533 --> 31:06.667
from the Beijing government,

31:06.734 --> 31:08.400
has decided not
to grant asylum

31:08.467 --> 31:10.700
to the 35 remaining
Chinese illegals

31:10.767 --> 31:13.367
whose freighter crashed
off Jeb Island Sound.

31:13.433 --> 31:15.700
The refugees will be deported
to China tomorrow,

31:15.767 --> 31:19.266
where they face
an uncertain future.

31:19.333 --> 31:21.333
Business news is next
with Marcia Levy.

31:32.233 --> 31:34.000
- Yo, look who's
out of Solitary.

31:35.767 --> 31:38.133
- I forgot Ketchum
was in Oz.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.300
- Yeah, he got here
a couple months ago.

31:40.367 --> 31:42.266
Calls himself
Supreme Allah.

31:42.333 --> 31:44.000
-  Right.

31:44.066 --> 31:47.467
- He's been on trial for
killing two other inmates.

31:47.533 --> 31:50.567
- Burr, heard you
were in circulation.

31:50.633 --> 31:52.900
- Get the fuck away
from me, Ketchum.

31:58.800 --> 32:00.033
- Yeah, all right.

32:05.767 --> 32:06.867
- What was that about?

32:08.967 --> 32:11.400
- Augustus, you ever wonder why
the cops knew where you was at

32:11.467 --> 32:13.066
the night you got arrested?

32:13.133 --> 32:15.100
- Yeah, I figured they
had me under surveillance.

32:15.166 --> 32:17.567
- Surveillance, my black ass.

32:18.567 --> 32:20.133
Ketchum told them.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.967
- What?

32:22.033 --> 32:23.867
- They had him
on an old warrant.

32:24.834 --> 32:26.967
They were squeezing him hard.

32:27.033 --> 32:28.500
He gave you up.

32:28.567 --> 32:32.367
If it wasn't
for Supreme Allah,

32:32.433 --> 32:34.633
you wouldn't be
in that wheelchair.

32:35.967 --> 32:38.033
You wouldn't be in Oz.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.333
- We don't like Burr Redding
any more than you.

32:54.400 --> 32:57.333
- You want him dead;
we want him dead.

32:57.400 --> 32:58.533
- Take care of this,

32:58.600 --> 33:00.800
we'll cut you
into the operation.

33:00.867 --> 33:02.500
- Done.

33:02.567 --> 33:04.667
Only I need a little time.

33:04.734 --> 33:07.400
Get some of the other
brothers on my side.

33:07.467 --> 33:09.433
- But don't wait too long.

33:09.500 --> 33:11.600
Redding's planning
his own move.

33:11.667 --> 33:14.166
We have to snap his neck
before he snaps ours.

33:39.633 --> 33:42.200
- Damn, dude.

33:42.266 --> 33:43.834
Being crippled must suck.

33:45.100 --> 33:48.567
- Nah, Supreme,
it's a pleasure cruise.

33:50.867 --> 33:53.834
- I know you know Burr Redding
from the same corner as me.

33:53.900 --> 33:56.166
- Hung with the man
all my life.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.500
He took care of me and my family
when my daddy

33:59.567 --> 34:01.266
got killed in 'Nam.
- Yeah, I know you

34:01.333 --> 34:03.633
got much love for him,

34:03.700 --> 34:06.834
which is why you got
to let the man know

34:06.900 --> 34:09.300
Spics and the Wops

34:09.367 --> 34:11.200
want him deceased.

34:11.266 --> 34:13.467
- You so worried about him,
why don't you tell him yourself?

34:13.533 --> 34:16.333
-  Nigger won't
let me get near him.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.934
- That surprises you?

34:19.000 --> 34:20.333
- Shit, yeah.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.767
I ain't never done
nothing to backhand him.

34:22.834 --> 34:25.867
- What about me?
- Speak clearly, dog.

34:25.934 --> 34:27.734
- You put me in here.

34:27.800 --> 34:30.133
In Oz, in the wheelchair.

34:31.333 --> 34:32.367
- Bullshit.

34:32.433 --> 34:33.867
- Burr found out
that you was the one

34:33.934 --> 34:35.834
that ratted me out
to the cops.

34:35.900 --> 34:37.834
- Like I said,

34:37.900 --> 34:39.834
bullshit.

34:39.900 --> 34:42.133
- Bullshit.

34:42.200 --> 34:45.233
I'll show you bullshit, nigga!
- What the fuck? What the--

34:47.567 --> 34:49.967
- Hey! Ah! Shit!

34:50.033 --> 34:51.900
Ahh! Ahh!

34:53.600 --> 34:56.233
- Mother fucking crazy!

35:04.834 --> 35:06.033
- Ah!

35:20.133 --> 35:23.633
- Takes a lot of balls to beat
a fella in a wheelchair.

35:24.900 --> 35:26.300
- I didn't touch Hill.

35:27.734 --> 35:30.333
- Just like you didn't kill
those two other inmates,

35:30.400 --> 35:31.834
Shemin and Browne.

35:33.200 --> 35:34.667
- I'm innocent of that.

35:36.700 --> 35:39.033
- There's others who gotta
pay for that crime.

35:41.133 --> 35:42.867
- Mm.

35:42.934 --> 35:47.266
I suppose you're also innocent
of shooting Craig Daniels.

35:47.333 --> 35:49.533
- No.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.633
That motherfucker
laughed at me.

35:55.533 --> 35:57.600
He got what he deserved.

36:08.633 --> 36:10.033
- I'm telling you,
Supreme Allah knows

36:10.100 --> 36:12.100
we whacked shemin and Browne
and that we pinned

36:12.166 --> 36:13.734
the murders on him.

36:13.800 --> 36:15.600
- How could he? I didn't tell
him, you didn't tell him.

36:15.667 --> 36:16.867
- Hey, maybe
he figured it out.

36:16.934 --> 36:18.667
Both of them were guys
Beecher fucked.

36:18.734 --> 36:20.600
- So, maybe he thinks
that you did it.

36:20.667 --> 36:21.767
But not me.

36:24.633 --> 36:26.767
- What, are you looking to hang
me out to dry there, O'Reily?

36:26.834 --> 36:28.400
- No.

36:28.467 --> 36:31.133
Look, maybe I can go see Allah,
figure out what he really knows.

36:31.200 --> 36:32.467
You can trust me, K-boy.

36:32.533 --> 36:35.033
- I got no other choice.

36:39.867 --> 36:41.066
Fuck!

36:41.133 --> 36:42.800
I'm such an idiot.

36:44.200 --> 36:45.667
Hey, Supreme,
old pal.

36:45.734 --> 36:48.000
This thing is crashing
every time I try to boot it up.

36:48.066 --> 36:49.367
Can you take a look
at it for me?

36:49.433 --> 36:51.667
- No.

36:51.734 --> 36:54.633
- No? What do you got,
PMS or something?

36:56.834 --> 36:59.700
- You know, I sat in Solitary
plenty of hours, O'Reily.

37:01.100 --> 37:03.200
Had time to put
two and two together.

37:05.400 --> 37:09.300
Shemin and Browne
plus Keller and O'Reily

37:09.367 --> 37:11.500
equals me almost
on death row.

37:12.400 --> 37:16.467
- Hmm. Well, you had it
wrong there, cuz.

37:18.467 --> 37:20.767
Well, addition never
was my best subject.

37:21.834 --> 37:24.100
Always favored subtraction.

37:25.934 --> 37:28.300
Let me see, Oz minus

37:28.367 --> 37:31.166
Keller and O'Reily

37:31.233 --> 37:32.734
equals justice.

37:50.233 --> 37:54.166
- Why are you so anxious to see
the world rid of Supreme Allah?

37:54.233 --> 37:57.200
- Well, I guess
the same reasons as you.

37:57.266 --> 37:59.233
His grasp exceeds his reach.

37:59.300 --> 38:01.533
- And you come to me?

38:01.600 --> 38:03.700
- I'm willing to give you
any assistance you may need.

38:03.767 --> 38:06.767
-  Yeah, well,
I need no assistance

38:06.834 --> 38:10.333
because I don't
mean him any harm.

38:10.400 --> 38:12.800
I wish the man
only the best.

38:17.333 --> 38:20.433
That's right, Thursday,
11:00 a.m., sharp.

38:20.500 --> 38:22.166
You hear me, Tug?

38:22.233 --> 38:23.734
Be on time.

38:27.734 --> 38:28.934
We're all set.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.967
I'm telling you, we gotta
do something and fast.

38:36.033 --> 38:37.600
- You know, I just got
the funniest feeling

38:37.667 --> 38:39.867
the old man is gonna
take care of everything.

38:47.400 --> 38:48.767
- The reason
you couldn't come see me

38:48.834 --> 38:50.066
is 'cause they
had me in Solitary

38:50.133 --> 38:52.700
'cause they thought I killed
some motherfuckers.

38:52.767 --> 38:55.100
You understand?
I didn't even do shit to these--

38:55.166 --> 38:56.767
I don't even know
these motherfuckers.

38:56.834 --> 38:59.066
Talking 'bout how
I stabbed these...

39:04.867 --> 39:07.433
- 'Sup?

39:07.500 --> 39:08.900
- Ah!

39:10.066 --> 39:12.567
- Ah, fuck!

39:18.100 --> 39:19.633
- This shank is a classic.

39:19.700 --> 39:21.066
The bottom end of a toothbrush

39:21.133 --> 39:23.233
is carved down
to its sharpest point,

39:23.300 --> 39:24.967
almost like an arrowhead.

39:25.033 --> 39:26.700
But the best part is,

39:26.767 --> 39:28.800
the weapon doesn't have
to be concealed.

39:28.867 --> 39:31.300
It can be placed in a pocket,

39:31.367 --> 39:32.633
bristles showing,

39:32.700 --> 39:35.367
ready to be grabbed
for action.

39:35.433 --> 39:38.500
- Look, I barely met
Tug Daniels.

39:38.567 --> 39:41.734
He calls, he says
he needs to see me.

39:41.800 --> 39:43.467
Man, how was I supposed to know
what he's got

39:43.533 --> 39:45.033
brewin' in his head?

39:45.100 --> 39:47.066
- Did you know Supreme Allah
was serving time

39:47.133 --> 39:49.166
for shooting Daniels' brother?

39:49.233 --> 39:51.033
- Yeah, man, I guess.

39:51.100 --> 39:52.500
- Where'd he get the shank?

39:52.567 --> 39:54.567
- He must've brought it in
with him.

39:54.633 --> 39:56.834
Look, don't be blaming me
for your lax security.

39:56.900 --> 39:58.867
- Maybe some time in the cage
will help you

39:58.934 --> 40:02.233
see things clearer.
- The cage?

40:02.300 --> 40:05.300
I ain't do shit.
I ain't do shit.

40:05.367 --> 40:07.934
Ahh, man.

40:20.567 --> 40:22.400
- Timmy.

40:22.467 --> 40:24.233
- Father Mukada,
where you been?

40:24.300 --> 40:26.934
- On retreat.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.066
Father McConkey says
that while I've been away,

40:29.133 --> 40:31.400
you stopped being
an altar boy at mass.

40:31.467 --> 40:33.667
- The Catholic church
is Satan's whore.

40:33.734 --> 40:35.000
- What?

40:35.066 --> 40:36.867
- The Pope sucks
on the tit of the beast.

40:36.934 --> 40:39.166
Rome is the Gomorrah
of the new world order.

40:40.800 --> 40:42.967
- Where on earth
did you hear that?

40:43.033 --> 40:44.500
- The Reverend Cloutier.

40:44.567 --> 40:45.667
At first when
he started preaching,

40:45.734 --> 40:48.200
I thought he was
a real dipshit.

40:48.266 --> 40:50.333
But a lot of what
he says makes sense.

40:50.400 --> 40:53.333
- Like?
- That I should convert.

40:53.400 --> 40:55.100
Cloutier says
if I do convert,

40:55.166 --> 40:56.834
there's this Bible college
in West Virginia

40:56.900 --> 40:58.400
where I can do
a correspondence course,

40:58.467 --> 41:00.600
get my college degree
for free.

41:00.667 --> 41:02.367
- Timmy, if that's
what you want,

41:02.433 --> 41:04.867
there are plenty of other
schools to choose from

41:04.934 --> 41:06.266
before you decide.

41:06.333 --> 41:08.467
I could help you--
- No, that's okay.

41:12.633 --> 41:13.967
God be with you.

41:20.166 --> 41:24.133
- Hello, Reverend.
Please be seated.

41:24.934 --> 41:26.834
Thank you, Officer.

41:29.700 --> 41:31.266
Well, I wasn't here
when you arrived,

41:31.333 --> 41:34.633
so I thought that now that
I'm back, we should meet.

41:34.700 --> 41:36.500
- Excellent.

41:36.567 --> 41:38.200
Although, Father,
I must say I was shocked

41:38.266 --> 41:40.166
to see how the protestant
population of Oz

41:40.233 --> 41:42.266
was being served.
- I try to do the best

41:42.333 --> 41:43.967
I can for everyone.

41:44.033 --> 41:45.934
- Yes, I'm sure you do.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.033
- And, uh, I'm glad
that you're here to help.

41:49.100 --> 41:51.867
Which reminds me that I had
a discussion with Timothy Kirk.

41:52.600 --> 41:54.767
He says he wants
to go for a B.A.

41:54.834 --> 41:56.033
- Well, with
the right education,

41:56.100 --> 41:57.734
he could find the way.

41:57.800 --> 41:59.300
- Well, see, that's
exactly what I wanted

41:59.367 --> 42:01.800
to discuss with you,
the right education.

42:03.667 --> 42:06.500
I don't think that
a Bible college is best for him.

42:06.567 --> 42:08.367
- Where would you
prefer he study,

42:08.433 --> 42:09.867
With the Jesuits?

42:09.934 --> 42:12.500
- No, not necessarily,
but he's young,

42:12.567 --> 42:15.166
lost, confused.

42:15.233 --> 42:17.867
I would hate for there to be
any undue pressure.

42:17.934 --> 42:21.133
- He was baptized a Catholic,

42:21.200 --> 42:23.200
went to eight years
of parochial education.

42:23.266 --> 42:25.767
There were monks
in his high school.

42:25.834 --> 42:27.734
You don't call that
undue pressure?

42:27.800 --> 42:30.734
- Look, I didn't ask you here
for a theological debate.

42:30.800 --> 42:33.767
- No, that's exactly
why you asked me here.

42:33.834 --> 42:37.166
You're afraid of losing
Kirk to Christ.

42:39.033 --> 42:41.233
- He already has Christ.

42:43.133 --> 42:45.800
- That is not Christ.

42:45.867 --> 42:48.000
That is showbiz
on a stick.

42:48.967 --> 42:50.200
- Showbiz.

42:52.100 --> 42:55.467
You, of all people, you have
turned faith into a cartoon.

42:55.533 --> 42:57.100
- Be careful, Father.

42:57.166 --> 43:02.266
Anger, envy, those are two
of the seven deadly sins.

43:06.166 --> 43:09.133
This afternoon, I will be
baptizing Timmy Kirk

43:09.200 --> 43:10.533
as a true Christian.

43:12.266 --> 43:13.600
You're welcome to attend.

43:13.667 --> 43:20.500
- ♪ Jesus loves
his little children ♪

43:20.567 --> 43:26.667
♪ All the little children
of the world ♪

43:26.734 --> 43:30.133
chorus: ♪ Red and yellow,
Black and white ♪

43:30.200 --> 43:33.934
♪ They are precious

43:34.000 --> 43:40.066
♪ Jesus loves the little

43:41.367 --> 43:43.567
- My first few days here
I was terrified,

43:43.633 --> 43:45.700
sharing a cell
with Adebisi.

43:49.133 --> 43:51.934
And you came to me,
all friendly.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.033
- I saved you from
that black bastard.

43:54.100 --> 43:55.834
- Vern, you know the rules.

43:55.900 --> 43:57.900
Let Tobias finish
his thought.

43:57.967 --> 43:59.233
- Right.

44:00.967 --> 44:02.233
Go on.

44:03.533 --> 44:05.834
The man that I was,

44:05.900 --> 44:09.033
the man that I have become,

44:09.100 --> 44:11.934
that's mine to carry.

44:12.000 --> 44:15.066
But you've got to accept your
share of the responsibility

44:15.133 --> 44:16.667
for everything
that's happened.

44:20.433 --> 44:22.100
- What are you doing
interrupting us?

44:22.166 --> 44:23.367
- Sorry, Sister.
Warden sent me

44:23.433 --> 44:25.533
to fetch Schillinger,
says it's an emergency.

44:32.667 --> 44:35.700
- I got a call today from
the Massachusetts State Police.

44:35.767 --> 44:38.300
A few days ago they discovered
the body of a young man

44:38.367 --> 44:41.834
who'd evidently been dead
for several months.

44:41.900 --> 44:43.734
A bullet to the back
of the head.

44:43.800 --> 44:45.066
They checked
the dental records,

44:45.133 --> 44:47.667
and discovered
the identity of the victim.

44:48.567 --> 44:51.100
Your son, Hank.

44:51.166 --> 44:53.367
- No.

44:53.433 --> 44:54.834
No, Hank's in Florida.

44:56.400 --> 44:58.033
Cops made a mistake.

44:59.066 --> 45:00.967
- That's possible,
but I doubt it.

45:01.033 --> 45:02.200
- It's a mistake.

45:02.266 --> 45:03.934
Cops made
a fucking mistake.

45:05.633 --> 45:08.400
Hank's not dead,
he can't be dead.

45:08.467 --> 45:10.500
He's got
this cute little wife

45:10.567 --> 45:12.133
and they're gonna have
a baby.

45:14.266 --> 45:15.567
Hank is not dead!

45:15.633 --> 45:17.000
You hear me?
He's not dead!

45:22.967 --> 45:26.000
- Yeah, your kid was involved
in all kinds of shit.

45:26.066 --> 45:28.633
Drug deals and pimping.

45:28.700 --> 45:30.934
So there's any number of people
who might want him dead.

45:34.133 --> 45:35.800
- This is you consoling me?

45:35.867 --> 45:38.433
- This is me giving you
the hard, cold facts.

45:38.500 --> 45:40.367
Your son was murdered.

45:40.433 --> 45:42.066
Now, somebody's gotta pay.

45:42.133 --> 45:43.967
And I think that somebody
is Beecher.

45:44.033 --> 45:45.700
- Beecher.

45:45.767 --> 45:48.133
- You know how we kept
expecting him to retaliate

45:48.200 --> 45:50.700
for Hank killing his son,
but nothing happened?

45:50.767 --> 45:53.800
Well, that's 'cause he'd
already taken care of it.

45:53.867 --> 45:56.066
We're in Oz.
There's a shitload of guys

45:56.133 --> 45:57.600
who could arrange that hit.

45:59.433 --> 46:00.667
- That fuck--

46:04.734 --> 46:06.867
I'll kill his daughter.

46:06.934 --> 46:08.867
I'll kill his whole
fucking family.

46:16.633 --> 46:18.400
Do you see him?

46:18.467 --> 46:20.967
- No.

46:21.033 --> 46:22.800
- Vern, I just heard
about your son.

46:22.867 --> 46:23.867
I'm so sorry.

46:23.934 --> 46:24.867
- Thank you, Reverend.

46:24.934 --> 46:26.333
- Why don't we
pray together?

46:26.400 --> 46:28.233
- How does the quote go?

46:28.300 --> 46:29.233
"There is a time to be born,

46:29.300 --> 46:30.800
"a time to die,

46:30.867 --> 46:32.600
a time for every purpose
under heaven"?

46:32.667 --> 46:33.600
- Yes.
- Well, the time

46:33.667 --> 46:34.667
for praying is over.

46:34.734 --> 46:37.100
- No, Vern, Jesus
can comfort you.

46:37.166 --> 46:38.533
- Not today.

46:41.667 --> 46:44.200
- Leave the man alone,
okay, Rev?

46:48.600 --> 46:49.900
- You seen Beecher,
where's Beecher?

46:49.967 --> 46:51.467
The shit is
going down fast.

46:51.533 --> 46:54.066
- He had a play date
with his daughter.

46:54.133 --> 46:55.633
- God damn it.
I gotta get to him.

46:55.700 --> 46:57.300
How the fuck am I
gonna get to him?

47:04.066 --> 47:07.266
- Mr. Lion, hello.

47:07.333 --> 47:10.633
- Hey, you.
- Me?

47:10.700 --> 47:11.667
- Yeah.

47:11.734 --> 47:12.700
You Beecher's brother?

47:12.767 --> 47:14.333
- Uh-huh.

47:23.500 --> 47:25.867
- I have a civilian down.
- Oh, Angus!

47:25.934 --> 47:27.533
Oh, God. Angus.
- Get him out of here!

47:27.600 --> 47:28.700
- He's my brother!
- Get him out!

47:28.767 --> 47:30.500
- Please, just get him
some help!

47:30.567 --> 47:31.967
Get him some help!

47:32.033 --> 47:33.133
- Just get some help!

47:33.200 --> 47:34.867
- And then there's
the Don Juan.

47:34.934 --> 47:37.467
You take a spring from the frame
underneath your bed,

47:37.533 --> 47:40.500
uncoil it, and then
sharpen the edge.

47:40.567 --> 47:44.800
The wound itself is smaller
but goes much deeper.

47:44.867 --> 47:47.567
Like Don Juan,

47:47.633 --> 47:49.100
it penetrates.

48:01.333 --> 48:02.800
- Dad.

48:04.400 --> 48:06.633
You've got to take
Holly away.

48:06.700 --> 48:08.333
- She's in danger again.

48:08.400 --> 48:09.834
- From the same man
who killed Gary.

48:09.900 --> 48:11.367
- Well, we'll tell
the police.

48:11.433 --> 48:13.500
- The police?

48:13.567 --> 48:16.400
The police can't
help us now.

48:16.467 --> 48:18.367
Take her away,
keep her away.

48:18.433 --> 48:20.066
Do you understand?

48:20.133 --> 48:22.767
- Yes, I understand.

48:22.834 --> 48:24.266
But I'm not sure she will.

48:25.300 --> 48:26.633
Talk to her, Toby.

48:26.700 --> 48:28.133
Explain what's happening.

48:33.600 --> 48:34.700
- Thank you.

48:36.533 --> 48:40.934
Holly, it was so good
to see you today.

48:43.133 --> 48:46.166
I know I told you that
you'd be coming back soon,

48:46.233 --> 48:48.500
but, uh, Grandpa...

48:50.000 --> 48:53.000
...is gonna take you on
a little trip for a while.

48:53.066 --> 48:55.934
And, um, when you get back,

48:56.000 --> 49:00.033
you and I are gonna be
together forever and ever.

49:01.133 --> 49:03.967
Okay? I love you.

49:06.767 --> 49:08.600
Remember that.

49:08.667 --> 49:09.834
Always.

49:13.433 --> 49:16.300
- You've gotta kill
Schillinger.

49:16.367 --> 49:19.133
- No.
- What's the alternative?

49:20.533 --> 49:21.834
- I let him kill me.

49:21.900 --> 49:24.367
- What the hell
does that mean?

49:24.433 --> 49:26.233
- If I offer to die,
maybe that'll end all this.

49:26.300 --> 49:28.033
Maybe he'll let
my family be.

49:28.100 --> 49:29.166
- And what are you
gonna get out of him,

49:29.233 --> 49:31.100
a written guarantee?

49:31.166 --> 49:32.233
- What are my options?

49:32.300 --> 49:34.567
- We pin Hank's murder
on someone else.

49:36.033 --> 49:39.300
- Who? And then what?

49:39.367 --> 49:40.567
Schillinger kills that person?
No, I've got

49:40.633 --> 49:41.934
enough death
on my conscience.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.500
I gotta go.
- No, Beech, Jesus,

49:43.567 --> 49:44.500
come on, just listen to me.

49:44.567 --> 49:45.500
Let's just relax,
all right?

49:45.567 --> 49:47.100
Let's breathe,
all right?

49:47.166 --> 49:49.400
Think what you're doing,
think it through.

49:49.467 --> 49:50.967
- I have.

49:51.033 --> 49:53.333
My family can't hide forever.

49:54.800 --> 49:57.867
If I don't handle this now,
Schillinger will destroy them.

49:57.934 --> 50:00.033
- That's what I'm talking about,
handling it.

50:00.100 --> 50:01.800
Don't you understand that?

50:01.867 --> 50:03.700
All we gotta do
is kill Schillinger.

50:03.767 --> 50:06.066
- And then the Aryans
will still kill me.

50:06.133 --> 50:07.367
And for all I know,

50:07.433 --> 50:09.400
Schillinger's unborn
grandchild will grow up

50:09.467 --> 50:10.967
and find my grandchild
and kill him.

50:11.033 --> 50:13.500
No! Chris, this is
the only way to do it.

50:13.567 --> 50:14.800
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

50:14.867 --> 50:17.567
- Chris, let me go.
- Wait, just wait, wait.

50:17.633 --> 50:19.133
Just wait.

50:19.200 --> 50:20.233
Okay.

50:25.800 --> 50:28.166
- Tomorrow we'll continue
with the spiritual evaluation

50:28.233 --> 50:29.900
of Zedekiah.

50:34.066 --> 50:36.133
- Reverend.

50:36.200 --> 50:38.200
- Yes. Uh, Keller, right?

50:38.266 --> 50:39.867
- You know what Vern
Schillinger has planned

50:39.934 --> 50:41.734
against Tobias Beecher,
don't you?

50:41.800 --> 50:44.166
- I'm afraid I do.

50:44.233 --> 50:46.000
And I'm helpless to stop him.

50:46.066 --> 50:48.300
- He thinks Beecher
ordered the hit on Hank.

50:48.367 --> 50:50.800
Schillinger's wrong.
I ordered the hit.

50:50.867 --> 50:52.967
- You?
- I will confess my crime

50:53.033 --> 50:54.567
to the authorities,
but I need you

50:54.633 --> 50:56.767
to tell Schillinger the truth.

50:56.834 --> 51:01.400
- So, you see that Keller
is the guilty one.

51:01.467 --> 51:04.834
Tobias Beecher
is totally innocent.

51:04.900 --> 51:08.133
Doing harm to him or his family
would be a tragic mistake.

51:10.433 --> 51:13.166
- I appreciate your coming
to see me, Reverend.

51:13.233 --> 51:15.333
- You believe this bullshit?

51:15.400 --> 51:16.934
Beecher killed Hank.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.834
Beecher killed your son.

52:03.133 --> 52:05.333
- What's your best memory
of your son?

52:15.066 --> 52:18.834
- First time he came up,

52:18.900 --> 52:22.200
unprompted, and hugged me

52:22.266 --> 52:24.000
and said, "Daddy, I love you."

52:33.100 --> 52:37.266
- Beecher, I promise not
to hurt your daughter

52:37.333 --> 52:39.266
or anybody else in your family.

52:42.100 --> 52:45.667
See, I wanna believe that you
are innocent of killing Hank.

52:47.400 --> 52:49.233
I wanna believe because...

52:51.867 --> 52:54.266
...I need to believe
in something.

52:55.900 --> 52:57.633
Something besides hate.

53:00.600 --> 53:02.734
This grandchild
that's coming...

53:05.033 --> 53:06.533
...is my last chance.

53:08.633 --> 53:09.867
My last hope.

53:12.100 --> 53:15.533
I want this kid to--

53:15.600 --> 53:17.700
put his arms around my neck

53:17.767 --> 53:19.567
and say, "I love you."

53:22.166 --> 53:23.200
'Cause...

53:28.066 --> 53:30.433
See, I never had that before.

53:33.700 --> 53:35.834
I am sorry about your son.

53:54.533 --> 53:56.033
- I'm sorry about yours too.

54:09.900 --> 54:13.367
- Hello, Chris.
- Sister Pete.

54:13.433 --> 54:15.400
You come to wish me
a bon voyage?

54:15.467 --> 54:17.000
- Sit down.

54:19.066 --> 54:22.100
Uh, I--I don't know

54:22.166 --> 54:24.533
quite what's happened,

54:24.600 --> 54:26.867
but I suspect, as usual,

54:26.934 --> 54:28.900
that you know the whole truth.

54:30.066 --> 54:31.567
- Which I've told.

54:33.767 --> 54:35.367
- I think you lied.

54:35.433 --> 54:37.433
-  Do you?

54:39.333 --> 54:42.200
- You lied for a greater truth.

54:44.567 --> 54:47.533
Some time ago you and I had
a conversation about God.

54:48.900 --> 54:51.567
"We don't choose God.

54:51.633 --> 54:53.734
God chooses us."

54:56.033 --> 54:58.467
- I remember.

54:58.533 --> 55:00.734
- And you said that you
wanted God to choose you,

55:00.800 --> 55:02.333
but you thought
it was too late.

55:04.900 --> 55:07.333
It's never too late.

55:09.500 --> 55:12.967
God finally
did choose you, Chris.

55:16.934 --> 55:18.633
And he chose wisely.

55:28.533 --> 55:30.500
You have a couple minutes.

55:34.867 --> 55:37.467
- Sorry, I can't hug you back.

55:41.200 --> 55:43.000
- Schillinger believed Cloutier.

55:43.066 --> 55:44.200
Thinks I'm innocent.

55:45.700 --> 55:48.233
He even shook my hand.
- Yeah, you see?

55:48.300 --> 55:50.900
And I get a nice trip
to Massachusetts,

55:50.967 --> 55:53.200
stand trial, serve life
in Cedar Junction

55:53.266 --> 55:54.867
far from Schillinger's reach.

55:54.934 --> 55:56.800
- There are Aryans
in Massachusetts.

55:56.867 --> 55:59.133
- Half-assed Aryans.

55:59.200 --> 56:01.233
Besides, I think I've proven
that I'm pretty nimble

56:01.300 --> 56:03.100
when it comes to staying alive.

56:05.200 --> 56:07.433
- Why are you doing this?

56:09.100 --> 56:11.667
- I would have thought
that was fairly obvious.

56:13.200 --> 56:14.300
- Yeah.

56:15.400 --> 56:17.333
- Besides, I love the irony.

56:17.400 --> 56:19.133
I've gotten away
with all of those murders

56:19.200 --> 56:20.800
I actually committed,
and here I am

56:20.867 --> 56:22.967
confessing to the one
I'm innocent of.

56:24.533 --> 56:27.000
- Uh, it's time, gentlemen.

56:44.600 --> 56:45.767
- I'll see you.

56:47.300 --> 56:49.166
-  When?

56:51.567 --> 56:54.700
- Back here.
Or in heaven.

56:54.767 --> 56:57.166
- You really think
we're gonna get into heaven?

56:57.233 --> 56:59.900
- Aw, you and me together.

56:59.967 --> 57:02.133
God doesn't have the balls
to keep us out.

57:13.633 --> 57:16.367
- The worst stab wound
is the one to the heart.

57:16.433 --> 57:17.834
Sure, most people survive it,

57:17.900 --> 57:19.900
but the heart is never
quite the same.

57:19.967 --> 57:22.667
There's always a scar,
which is meant, I guess,

57:22.734 --> 57:26.000
to remind you that
even for a little while,

57:26.066 --> 57:28.834
someone made your heart
beat faster.

57:28.900 --> 57:30.700
And that's a scar
you can live with,

57:30.767 --> 57:32.367
proudly,

57:32.433 --> 57:34.467
all the days of your life.
