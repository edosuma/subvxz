WEBVTT

00:05.364 --> 00:06.865
(sighs)

00:09.302 --> 00:11.304
Come on in, Monica.

00:13.706 --> 00:14.740
MONICA:
Thank you.

00:14.873 --> 00:16.375
Mm-hmm.

00:23.716 --> 00:26.352
Wow, you've known
the president a long time.

00:26.485 --> 00:29.255
Yes.
We're close.

00:29.388 --> 00:32.258
We met when we were teenagers.

00:32.391 --> 00:33.692
Oh, wow.

00:33.826 --> 00:36.829
-Closing things up here.
-Oh, sure.

00:44.737 --> 00:47.506
Okay. So...

00:47.640 --> 00:48.941
why are you here today?

00:49.074 --> 00:52.211
Oh, um, well, I applied
for the position

00:52.345 --> 00:54.613
at the National Security Office.

00:54.747 --> 00:56.315
Back here at the White House.

00:58.751 --> 01:01.387
I-I was under the impression
you were aware of that.

01:01.520 --> 01:04.623
Yes. Is there something
you'd like me to do about it?

01:04.757 --> 01:07.693
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm a little confused.

01:07.826 --> 01:11.464
I was told you were working
on placing me back here.

01:11.597 --> 01:13.031
Placing you in the White House?

01:14.367 --> 01:15.534
This is the first
I'm hearing of that.

01:15.668 --> 01:17.970
Oh.

01:18.103 --> 01:19.138
Remind me, where are you now?

01:19.272 --> 01:21.374
The Pentagon,
uh, Public Affairs.

01:21.507 --> 01:23.976
I'm the confidential assistant
to Ken Bacon,

01:24.109 --> 01:25.144
but before that, I was here.

01:25.278 --> 01:26.812
Why did you transfer out?

01:26.945 --> 01:31.750
Oh, um...
it wasn't really my decision.

01:31.884 --> 01:33.586
Whose decision was it?

01:33.719 --> 01:37.590
Evelyn Lieberman
made that arrangement.

01:37.723 --> 01:39.492
Right.

01:39.625 --> 01:41.160
I spoke to Evelyn about you.

01:41.294 --> 01:45.097
Oh, s-so you did speak
to someone?

01:45.231 --> 01:47.566
She gave me a rundown
of your departure.

01:49.635 --> 01:51.404
Monica...

01:51.537 --> 01:53.239
you've got a good job.

01:53.372 --> 01:55.674
You get to travel the world
with DoD.

01:55.808 --> 01:57.610
Why would you want
to come back here?

01:57.743 --> 02:00.446
I really love working
in the executive branch.

02:00.579 --> 02:01.647
Hmm.

02:03.148 --> 02:06.619
Well, unfortunately,

02:06.752 --> 02:08.887
that NSC job has been filled.

02:11.056 --> 02:12.858
-Oh, it has?
-Yeah.

02:12.991 --> 02:14.193
I'll just have to find
something else.

02:14.327 --> 02:17.930
Okay, um...

02:18.063 --> 02:19.865
because it's been almost a year

02:19.998 --> 02:21.200
since I was told
I'd be back here.

02:21.334 --> 02:22.501
And who told you that?

02:24.503 --> 02:25.371
He did.

02:25.504 --> 02:27.340
He who?

02:40.353 --> 02:42.187
(door opens)

02:45.023 --> 02:47.025
Linda.

02:48.093 --> 02:51.063
-Why would you do this?
-I'm not in the mood, Monica.

02:51.196 --> 02:53.232
The big creep
is gonna be so mad.

02:53.366 --> 02:57.002
Why? I called Kathleen a liar
because she is.

02:57.135 --> 02:58.837
I helped him.

02:58.971 --> 03:00.739
You said that he fondled
his employee in the West Wing.

03:00.873 --> 03:03.075
Oh, I should have known
you'd take his side.

03:03.208 --> 03:05.077
-I'm not!
-His lawyer Bob Bennett

03:05.210 --> 03:06.745
defames me on the world stage.

03:06.879 --> 03:09.415
He says I'm not
to be believed.

03:09.548 --> 03:12.518
And your only concern
is protecting him.

03:12.651 --> 03:15.254
Linda, he knows that
you and I are friends.

03:15.388 --> 03:16.589
You have to fix this.

03:16.722 --> 03:18.090
I am not the catalyst here.

03:18.223 --> 03:20.926
I didn't ask for a front-row
ticket to his misbehavior.

03:21.059 --> 03:23.929
I was handed one, forced
against my will to watch.

03:24.062 --> 03:26.765
Please. I am so close
to getting my job back.

03:26.899 --> 03:28.100
If the White House has
any excuse...

03:28.233 --> 03:30.202
I am at war
with the White House.

03:30.336 --> 03:33.272
For 20 years I have given
everything to this system.

03:33.406 --> 03:34.607
I have been nothing but loyal,

03:34.740 --> 03:36.208
and now I'm a target.

03:36.342 --> 03:38.377
I really don't think
you're a target.

03:38.511 --> 03:41.614
I was the last person
to see Vince Foster alive.

03:41.747 --> 03:45.918
The White House disposed of me
like a piece of trash.

03:47.320 --> 03:48.787
And they will do the same
to you, Monica.

03:48.921 --> 03:51.624
-I don't think so.
-Oh, trust me.

03:51.757 --> 03:53.058
I wasn't welcome back,
and you won't be either.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.260
Oh, Jesus, Linda,
no one wanted you back.

03:58.364 --> 04:00.366
(sighs)

04:00.499 --> 04:02.067
I'm sorry, I...

04:02.200 --> 04:04.136
That's not what I...

04:04.269 --> 04:05.438
That came out wrong, Linda.

04:06.439 --> 04:08.807
Linda, I am very scared,
and I'm worried about you

04:08.941 --> 04:10.242
because you're
a political appointee,

04:10.376 --> 04:12.611
-and you could lose
your job for this.
-Yeah.

04:13.612 --> 04:16.148
And then I'll write
a tell-all book.

04:16.281 --> 04:17.616
See how they like that.

04:18.617 --> 04:19.952
What does that mean?

04:21.520 --> 04:23.656
Don't be such a narcissist.

04:23.789 --> 04:27.560
It'll be about me, not you.

04:29.027 --> 04:30.796
(Monica huffs)

04:50.315 --> 04:52.317
Who left this here?

04:57.390 --> 04:59.492
Who put this here?!

05:17.175 --> 05:19.177
*

05:41.934 --> 05:44.336
(phone line ringing)

05:46.204 --> 05:48.407
LUCIANNE (on recording):
You've reached the office
of Lucianne Goldberg.

05:48.541 --> 05:49.975
-Start talking.
-(beep)

05:50.108 --> 05:52.010
Lucianne, it's Linda Tripp.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.412
I'm sure you've seen Newsweek.

05:53.546 --> 05:56.314
(sighs)
I need to talk.

05:56.449 --> 05:58.417
It's urgent, and I didn't know
who else to call.

05:58.551 --> 06:00.753
NEWSCASTER:
The pictures, for which
a London tabloid

06:00.886 --> 06:03.922
-reportedly paid $400,000...
-(phone rings)

06:04.056 --> 06:05.090
show Diana cavorting about...

06:05.223 --> 06:06.892
-Hello?
-MONICA: Hi.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.596
Hi.

06:10.729 --> 06:13.766
I just want to say again
I'm sorry about earlier.

06:13.899 --> 06:15.601
You know how important
you are to me, I just--

06:15.734 --> 06:17.102
I'm scared that
the big creep would be mad,

06:17.235 --> 06:18.270
and you and I would end up

06:18.403 --> 06:20.706
jobless in a ditch somewhere.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.274
Just kidding
about the ditch part.

06:22.407 --> 06:24.610
I understand.

06:24.743 --> 06:26.011
Do you forgive me?

06:26.144 --> 06:27.279
Of course.

06:27.412 --> 06:29.448
I have to say this has been

06:29.582 --> 06:31.950
such an unsettling 24 hours.

06:32.084 --> 06:33.786
Ugh, I know. Me, too.

06:33.919 --> 06:35.120
You know, I finally had
a meeting with Marsha.

06:35.253 --> 06:37.289
Did I tell you that?

06:37.422 --> 06:39.391
Who, I'll remind you, in July
said that there would be

06:39.525 --> 06:40.759
a job available for me
this fall

06:40.893 --> 06:43.061
and is now saying there might
not be one available

06:43.195 --> 06:45.230
-this year.
-You're kidding.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.065
No, I'm serious, Linda,
and at this point

06:47.199 --> 06:48.801
it's like Bill said
that she would secure

06:48.934 --> 06:50.903
a job for me months ago.

06:51.036 --> 06:53.972
When I call her, she acts like
she doesn't even know who I am,

06:54.106 --> 06:56.475
and then, when he
sends me back in to see her,

06:56.609 --> 06:58.911
she just sits there and stares
at me with these mean eyes

06:59.044 --> 07:01.647
and asks me all these questions,
like, "Why would you want

07:01.780 --> 07:02.981
"to come back to work
at the White House

07:03.115 --> 07:03.982
"to make less than you do

07:04.116 --> 07:05.250
at the Pentagon?"

07:05.383 --> 07:07.486
And "What's your
relationship to the president?"

07:07.620 --> 07:08.921
And it's like,
we all know why she's asking.

07:09.054 --> 07:10.823
She used to be his girlfriend.

07:10.956 --> 07:12.290
Mm-hmm.

07:12.424 --> 07:14.593
So I called Betty to see
if I could talk to him,

07:14.727 --> 07:16.895
but she keeps saying
that he's busy.

07:17.029 --> 07:18.396
I'm just so frustrated, Linda.

07:18.531 --> 07:19.998
He's the president
of the United States.

07:20.132 --> 07:22.167
He should be able to snap his
fingers and make this happen.

07:22.300 --> 07:24.336
And I know he's trying,
and I know

07:24.469 --> 07:26.338
it's not like he has a lot
of free time on his hands.

07:26.471 --> 07:28.073
But anyway...

07:29.074 --> 07:31.476
(cheering, whooping)

07:43.488 --> 07:45.090
-(quiet chatter)
-(music playing)

07:45.223 --> 07:48.093
Ryan. Allison.

07:48.226 --> 07:50.362
A little help.

07:50.495 --> 07:52.364
(chatter continues)

07:52.497 --> 07:54.432
Did anyone call for me?

07:54.567 --> 07:58.436
* And show you
that I'm real... *

07:58.571 --> 08:00.706
-A human being is speaking
to you.
-No.

08:00.839 --> 08:03.375
-(phone ringing)
-I'm not a fan of your tone.

08:03.508 --> 08:04.877
ALLISON:
Mm-hmm.

08:05.010 --> 08:06.044
Flying solo. You can join me

08:06.178 --> 08:07.713
-if you want.
-Monica.

08:07.846 --> 08:09.147
Guess again, dear.

08:09.281 --> 08:12.117
-Lucianne. Hi.
-(Lucianne laughs)

08:12.250 --> 08:14.052
I wasn't sure
you'd call me back.

08:14.186 --> 08:15.554
I probably shouldn't have.

08:15.688 --> 08:17.389
You get me all hot
and bothered thinking

08:17.522 --> 08:19.391
you're sitting on something big,
and then you vanish.

08:19.524 --> 08:21.159
Let me change phones.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.228
When I say hang up...

08:23.361 --> 08:25.564
-* Return of the Mack *
-* Oh, my God *

08:25.698 --> 08:27.566
-* You know that I'll be back *
-* Here I am... *

08:27.700 --> 08:29.735
-LUCIANNE: So, why'd you call?
-LINDA: Well, I have

08:29.868 --> 08:34.406
found myself in possession of
some very sensitive information,

08:34.539 --> 08:37.409
information of major
national importance.

08:37.542 --> 08:39.945
Yes.

08:41.647 --> 08:46.919
Last year a young woman was
placed in my office. She...

08:47.052 --> 08:50.088
-Oh, I don't know
quite how to say this.
-Linda,

08:50.222 --> 08:51.924
-I'm gonna hang up.
-No, no, no.

08:52.057 --> 08:53.826
Listen, this-this woman--

08:53.959 --> 08:57.596
she has, um, taken me in
as her confidant.

08:57.730 --> 09:01.333
And it turns out
she's the girlfriend

09:01.466 --> 09:03.435
of the president
of the United States.

09:03.568 --> 09:05.437
(Lucianne laughs)

09:05.570 --> 09:08.273
You honestly needed
that much build-up to tell me

09:08.406 --> 09:10.442
Bill Clinton has
a girl on the side? (laughs)

09:10.575 --> 09:13.612
Oh, trust me.
This is not his usual routine.

09:13.746 --> 09:15.280
-I'm talking long-term.
-Let me guess.

09:15.413 --> 09:17.783
-She's made it two days.
-No.

09:17.916 --> 09:19.652
Two years.

09:22.087 --> 09:23.956
What?

09:24.089 --> 09:26.291
It's actually quite disturbing.

09:26.424 --> 09:27.793
She was 21 when it started,

09:27.926 --> 09:29.227
an intern.

09:29.361 --> 09:31.797
He went after her immediately.

09:31.930 --> 09:33.632
I-I mean,
secret sexual encounters

09:33.766 --> 09:35.467
every chance he could get.

09:35.600 --> 09:39.037
He'd take a call with the prime
minister, she'd be on her knees.

09:39.171 --> 09:41.306
So, naturally, I am concerned

09:41.439 --> 09:43.742
about this young woman's
well-being.

09:43.876 --> 09:45.477
-Naturally.
-It's awful.

09:45.610 --> 09:47.245
He's been dragging her
through hell.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.915
Has Madame X considered

09:50.048 --> 09:51.650
-coming forward?
-No.

09:51.784 --> 09:53.752
No, she's not the type.

09:53.886 --> 09:55.988
And she thinks they're in love.

09:56.121 --> 09:57.923
And what do you think?

09:58.056 --> 10:01.493
She is in pain and-and
she can't see her way out.

10:01.626 --> 10:04.930
I mean, someone needs to end
this before anyone gets hurt.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.431
You could do a book.

10:06.564 --> 10:07.766
You really think so?

10:07.900 --> 10:10.335
Are you kidding?
The head honcho breaks

10:10.468 --> 10:12.404
the presidential seal
of an intern.

10:12.537 --> 10:14.006
That's six figures easy.

10:14.139 --> 10:16.008
Say goodbye
to bureaucratic bullshit,

10:16.141 --> 10:17.609
and you'll get to be a hero.

10:17.743 --> 10:19.011
It's your chance to

10:19.144 --> 10:21.714
expose Clinton
for what he really is.

10:23.381 --> 10:25.684
-Of course, you need proof.
-I have it.

10:25.818 --> 10:28.120
And I take notes-- dates, times.
I made an Excel

10:28.253 --> 10:31.189
spreadsheet documenting
every sexual encounter.

10:31.323 --> 10:32.825
Linda, you are not enough.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.429
You need real evidence.

10:37.562 --> 10:40.032
You said you talked to her
on the phone all the time.

10:40.165 --> 10:42.600
-Yeah.
-You could tape the calls.

10:44.236 --> 10:46.271
Pe-People do that?

10:49.174 --> 10:51.276
-I-Isn't it illegal?
-Nope.

10:51.409 --> 10:52.778
Completely kosher.

10:52.911 --> 10:55.180
(sighs)

10:56.514 --> 10:58.884
It's just...

10:59.017 --> 11:00.953
if she were to find out.

11:01.086 --> 11:03.889
Dear, we have been here before.

11:04.022 --> 11:05.390
If you're doing this,
you're going to have to commit.

11:05.523 --> 11:07.659
-(sighs)
-I know you're more accustomed

11:07.793 --> 11:09.728
to secretarial tasks,

11:09.862 --> 11:13.398
but this is your shot
at the big leagues.

11:13.531 --> 11:16.735
You're either taking it,
or you're not.

11:16.869 --> 11:18.737
So...

11:18.871 --> 11:20.873
think about it, call me back.

11:36.721 --> 11:40.759
She's standing right here...
with a bag.

11:40.893 --> 11:43.929
BETTY:
You do realize you have
to arrange visits with him

11:44.062 --> 11:46.098
in advance, like everyone else.

11:46.231 --> 11:48.600
I know. I'm sorry, but I...
I looked at his schedule,

11:48.733 --> 11:50.268
so I thought that maybe he...

11:50.402 --> 11:52.670
He's watching G.I. Jane
with Chelsea,

11:52.805 --> 11:54.973
and he cannot be disturbed.

11:56.408 --> 11:59.411
Why don't you have a seat?
Catch your breath.

12:00.412 --> 12:02.380
(Monica sighs)

12:02.514 --> 12:04.382
Oh, I feel like an idiot.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.584
I told myself
I wouldn't come here.

12:07.585 --> 12:10.455
He brought this back
from Martha's Vineyard,

12:10.588 --> 12:13.091
and he wanted me
to give these to you.

12:16.494 --> 12:18.030
All this? I just...

12:18.163 --> 12:20.298
All I asked for was a T-shirt.

12:20.432 --> 12:22.801
That's very sweet.

12:22.935 --> 12:26.905
Oh, God, everything he gets me
is so ugly.

12:27.039 --> 12:30.242
(laughs) I'll just say
one word-- Arkansas.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.710
Betty, why won't he see me?

12:32.845 --> 12:34.579
I just want to talk
about transferring back here.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.414
It'll take five minutes.
If he's watching the movie, I...

12:36.548 --> 12:38.683
I didn't invent the rules.
They apply to everyone.

12:41.453 --> 12:44.256
Okay. Sorry. I'm just...

12:44.389 --> 12:46.458
I'm in a weird place right now.

12:48.793 --> 12:50.262
Has he said anything
about my job?

12:50.395 --> 12:52.430
-He's working on it.
-Okay.

12:52.564 --> 12:53.832
Because Marsha hasn't helped
at all.

12:53.966 --> 12:56.134
He's doing the best he can.

13:02.908 --> 13:04.977
(voice breaking):
Thank you for your time, Betty.

13:07.812 --> 13:09.681
(sighs)

13:09.814 --> 13:11.917
(crying)

13:17.555 --> 13:18.556
(phone rings)

13:20.258 --> 13:23.095
-Hello.
-(Monica crying)

13:23.228 --> 13:24.529
I can't take it anymore.

13:24.662 --> 13:26.631
What happened?

13:26.764 --> 13:29.534
-All I do is the same shit.
-Where are you?

13:29.667 --> 13:30.768
Do you want me to come get you?

13:30.903 --> 13:32.871
There's something wrong
with me, Linda.

13:33.005 --> 13:34.439
I went over there.

13:34.572 --> 13:36.942
I was out of my mind. I...

13:37.075 --> 13:39.878
I was watching myself
do the thing

13:40.012 --> 13:42.380
that I promised myself
I wouldn't do.

13:42.514 --> 13:45.117
-Monica.
-And I can't even get it

13:45.250 --> 13:48.120
through my fucking skull

13:48.253 --> 13:52.290
that he doesn't give a shit
about me!

13:52.424 --> 13:55.227
I al... I always do this.

13:55.360 --> 13:57.062
Where are you?

13:57.195 --> 13:59.898
He won't even see me

14:00.032 --> 14:02.734
for two fucking minutes,

14:02.867 --> 14:05.670
and I spend every minute

14:05.803 --> 14:08.573
of every day thinking about him.

14:08.706 --> 14:12.410
It's like... it's like
a bad song that I can't

14:12.544 --> 14:15.213
get out of my head, and I...

14:19.551 --> 14:21.886
I don't... I don't want
to be here.

14:23.221 --> 14:25.557
I don't want to exist.

14:28.826 --> 14:31.396
(phone ringing)

14:33.831 --> 14:35.700
-Hello.
-LINDA: It's sick.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.435
The whole thing is sick.

14:37.569 --> 14:38.870
You should hear her talk

14:39.004 --> 14:40.605
about him. (scoffs)

14:40.738 --> 14:42.440
It's excruciating.

14:42.574 --> 14:45.043
She's in so much pain
over this pig.

14:45.177 --> 14:46.611
LUCIANNE:
The poor thing.

14:46.744 --> 14:48.780
He acts like
he's some great defender

14:48.913 --> 14:52.350
-of women.
-Mr. Feminist,
Mr. Women's Rights.

14:52.484 --> 14:53.952
He's a hypocrite.

14:54.086 --> 14:56.721
He's lied to her and led her on,
and now she is...

14:56.854 --> 14:58.456
She must be losing her mind.

14:58.590 --> 14:59.958
She is.

15:00.092 --> 15:02.160
She's losing her mind.

15:03.195 --> 15:05.030
I need to come forward.

15:05.163 --> 15:07.899
You want to do a book?

15:08.033 --> 15:09.301
It's the best thing
for everyone.

15:09.434 --> 15:12.137
I couldn't agree more.

15:12.270 --> 15:13.738
Of course, you do realize,

15:13.871 --> 15:15.974
once they get their grubby
little hands on this girl,

15:16.108 --> 15:17.976
the press will destroy her.

15:18.110 --> 15:21.413
It's a tabloid moment, then
she'll move on with her life.

15:21.546 --> 15:22.747
I don't know. You should see

15:22.880 --> 15:24.249
what the Clintons do
to his women.

15:24.382 --> 15:26.151
As soon as the name gets out,

15:26.284 --> 15:28.586
they make sure
she's chopped alive.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.822
I mean, Flowers, Jones--
they make a few calls,

15:30.955 --> 15:33.325
arrange a few leaks,
and suddenly

15:33.458 --> 15:36.094
a nice girl from Bible school
is the Whore of Babylon.

15:36.228 --> 15:39.264
Well, sure. They can do that
to cocktail waitresses

15:39.397 --> 15:43.601
or trailer people,
but Monica is different.

15:43.735 --> 15:46.438
She's from Beverly Hills,
a very privileged upbringing.

15:46.571 --> 15:48.506
I mean, she-she told me
when all this began,

15:48.640 --> 15:50.642
she knew
what she was getting into.

15:51.643 --> 15:53.678
She's no victim.

15:53.811 --> 15:55.913
She'll be fine.

15:56.048 --> 15:58.750
You'll lose her as a friend.

15:58.883 --> 16:01.986
LINDA:
I've made my peace with that.

16:11.996 --> 16:13.865
MAN:
Lots of people like

16:13.998 --> 16:16.168
the CTR-116.

16:17.235 --> 16:21.206
But personally,
I like the CTR-107 Vox.

16:21.339 --> 16:24.576
You get more bang for your buck,
and it has voice activation.

16:26.178 --> 16:28.180
I just need it to work.

16:35.520 --> 16:37.855
(TV plays quietly)

16:56.208 --> 16:58.643
(line ringing)

17:02.714 --> 17:03.915
MONICA:
Hi.

17:04.048 --> 17:05.917
Hi.

17:06.050 --> 17:08.086
-How are you?
-Ah.

17:08.220 --> 17:09.921
I'm fine.
I just got off the treadmill.

17:10.054 --> 17:11.423
I wish crying burnt calories.

17:11.556 --> 17:13.425
-(chuckles)
-I went to Needless Markups

17:13.558 --> 17:16.027
in Georgetown today.
I bought the big creep a tie.

17:16.161 --> 17:16.928
I miss him, Linda.

17:17.061 --> 17:18.830
Who do you miss?

17:18.963 --> 17:20.098
Bill. Who else?

17:20.232 --> 17:21.599
I mean, this is the man

17:21.733 --> 17:23.101
who called me
back-to-back nights,

17:23.235 --> 17:24.369
who literally
had me come see him

17:24.502 --> 17:25.937
on his fucking
wedding anniversary.

17:26.070 --> 17:28.273
And now what? Just weeks
of nothing? Total silence?

17:28.406 --> 17:29.941
Like, I don't know
what I'm supposed to think.

17:30.074 --> 17:32.277
Remind me. When was the last
time you two were together?

17:32.410 --> 17:34.179
-Linda, you know this.
-Well,

17:34.312 --> 17:36.514
-I know, but I don't remember
the exact date.
-It was when

17:36.648 --> 17:38.783
he gave me the Annie Lennox CD,
which, I mean,

17:38.916 --> 17:40.718
just to say it-- that's
completely a make-out album.

17:40.852 --> 17:42.120
Like, it's not even subtle.

17:42.254 --> 17:44.122
Was-was this when
he was on crutches?

17:44.256 --> 17:46.391
What? No. That was back
in March. Remember?

17:46.524 --> 17:48.059
'Cause I was surprised,
he could barely even walk,

17:48.193 --> 17:50.728
but he grabbed me and kissed me
the moment we were alone.

17:50.862 --> 17:52.230
Then what happened?

17:52.364 --> 17:54.932
Oh, we fooled around.

18:24.462 --> 18:26.531
*

18:35.973 --> 18:37.975
(knocking)

18:38.976 --> 18:41.346
Welcome to my safe house.

18:41.479 --> 18:43.248
-I didn't realize
you were a spy.
-(laughs)

18:43.381 --> 18:44.949
LUCIANNE:
You kid. Back in '72,

18:45.082 --> 18:47.185
I posed as press
on McGovern's plane.

18:47.319 --> 18:49.521
Remember Nixon?
You're welcome.

18:49.654 --> 18:51.523
This is my son Jonah's place.

18:51.656 --> 18:54.192
-Drink?
-I'm fine.

18:54.326 --> 18:55.360
Hello, Harvey.

18:56.394 --> 19:00.031
Hi, Linda. Someone gonna
tell me why I'm here?

19:00.164 --> 19:02.600
LUCIANNE:
As you know, Linda has access

19:02.734 --> 19:04.369
to some very sensitive details

19:04.502 --> 19:06.371
about the president's
extramarital activities.

19:06.504 --> 19:09.274
She's decided
to write a book about it.

19:09.407 --> 19:11.609
Congratulations.
How do I fit into this?

19:11.743 --> 19:13.211
There are people
who wrongly assume Linda's

19:13.345 --> 19:15.213
-in bed with the far right.
-(Linda scoffs)

19:15.347 --> 19:18.216
We need people to understand
that this story is legitimate.

19:18.350 --> 19:21.219
If you break the story first,
no one can deny it.

19:21.353 --> 19:22.954
So how do I know it's true?

19:30.862 --> 19:34.399
Concrete proof that the
president of the United States

19:34.532 --> 19:37.201
is having an affair
with an intern.

19:38.536 --> 19:40.405
-You've been taping her?
-Do you want to hear her voice?

19:40.538 --> 19:41.739
Why would I want
to hear her voice?

19:41.873 --> 19:43.040
I don't even know her name.

19:44.041 --> 19:47.379
Her name is Monica Lewinsky.

19:51.215 --> 19:53.017
MONICA:
I'm trying to see him tomorrow.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.586
Betty thinks he'll be around
after the state dinner.

19:54.719 --> 19:56.254
-No. Stop.
-(laughing): What's wrong?

19:56.388 --> 19:58.089
I can't listen to this.

19:58.222 --> 20:01.092
Taping without consent violates
my journalistic principles.

20:01.225 --> 20:03.160
-Oh, for God's sake.
-Why don't you tell me

20:03.295 --> 20:06.898
what's on the tape, and I can
see if it's worth listening to?

20:08.500 --> 20:12.604
Monica describes multiple sexual
encounters with the president,

20:12.737 --> 20:15.273
including a time
after his knee surgery,

20:15.407 --> 20:17.609
when he was holding himself up
on his crutches while they...

20:17.742 --> 20:20.011
That's it? She just talks
about having sex?

20:20.144 --> 20:22.847
They don't actually have sex,
just oral...

20:22.980 --> 20:24.282
She orgasms,
he doesn't like to...

20:24.416 --> 20:26.284
(laughing):
Ew, no.

20:26.418 --> 20:27.919
This is why you brought me here?

20:29.454 --> 20:31.623
(sighs)
I-I don't work
for the National Enquirer.

20:31.756 --> 20:34.526
I-I-I'm a serious reporter.

20:34.659 --> 20:35.693
I report on abuses of power.

20:35.827 --> 20:38.896
-This is an abuse of power.
-Linda,

20:39.030 --> 20:41.899
there's no question
that his behavior is disgusting.

20:42.033 --> 20:45.236
It's Bill Clinton. No shit.
But you said it yourself.

20:45.370 --> 20:47.038
It's not sexual harassment.

20:47.171 --> 20:49.407
LINDA:
Whatever the particular
terminology,

20:49.541 --> 20:50.808
he's the chief executive,

20:50.942 --> 20:52.076
and she's a kid
barely out of school,

20:52.209 --> 20:54.078
who lost her position
in the White House.

20:54.211 --> 20:57.582
Oh, a girl moved offices.
Forgive me.

20:57.715 --> 20:58.883
It's Iran-Contra all over again.

20:59.016 --> 21:01.819
There's no quid pro quo.

21:01.953 --> 21:03.321
He's not paying her off.

21:03.455 --> 21:05.623
He's not getting her a job
to keep her quiet.

21:08.393 --> 21:10.895
(phone ringing)

21:11.028 --> 21:12.997
-Did you check out
the Macy's sale?
-LINDA: Yes.

21:13.130 --> 21:16.067
-It's a total dud. (chuckles)
-(TV playing in background)

21:16.200 --> 21:19.337
Listen, I have something
very important

21:19.471 --> 21:21.406
that I need to tell you.

21:21.539 --> 21:24.075
I was talking
with a close friend who works

21:24.208 --> 21:25.443
at the White House.

21:25.577 --> 21:28.279
-What friend?
-Kate.

21:28.413 --> 21:29.847
-What's her last name?
-Friedrich.

21:29.981 --> 21:32.350
She's a major player
in National Security.

21:32.484 --> 21:34.752
-I don't think I know her.
-You don't, but,

21:34.886 --> 21:37.088
um... she knows you.

21:37.221 --> 21:39.457
Kate's very plugged in.

21:39.591 --> 21:42.460
She knows about all the hirings
and firings in the West Wing.

21:42.594 --> 21:44.028
So I thought, why don't I ask

21:44.161 --> 21:46.364
about Monica's job prospects
at the White House?

21:46.498 --> 21:48.700
-I mean, you've been
waiting so long.
-What did she say?

21:48.833 --> 21:50.267
(Linda sighs)

21:50.402 --> 21:52.269
I don't know how
to tell you this.

21:52.404 --> 21:53.638
Okay, Linda,
you're freaking me out.

21:53.771 --> 21:55.306
There's a black mark
on your name.

21:56.408 --> 21:58.643
-What does that mean?
-They know who you are.

21:58.776 --> 22:01.145
Kate said, "Monica Lewinsky

22:01.278 --> 22:03.047
will never get a job
at the White House."

22:03.180 --> 22:05.617
Okay, well, maybe you just
misunderstood her, and may...

22:05.750 --> 22:07.552
I just... I should just speak
to, um, Betty, or...

22:07.685 --> 22:09.220
She-she begged me
not to say anything,

22:09.353 --> 22:10.955
but she was very clear.

22:11.088 --> 22:12.189
You're not coming back.

22:14.025 --> 22:16.227
I just... I just talked
to Betty, and she said

22:16.360 --> 22:18.496
that he was working
on bringing me back. I should...

22:18.630 --> 22:20.164
-I should have known.
-You're right.

22:20.297 --> 22:21.999
Look, he owes you a job.

22:22.133 --> 22:24.402
And if it's not gonna be
the White House,

22:24.536 --> 22:26.404
he needs to find you one
somewhere else.

22:26.538 --> 22:28.239
How hard is it
to tell the truth?

22:28.372 --> 22:30.074
I've given them
a million opportunities.

22:30.207 --> 22:33.010
Monica, you know what?

22:34.045 --> 22:35.947
You need
to take advantage of this.

22:37.081 --> 22:39.484
Maybe Bill's friend
Vernon Jordan can help.

22:39.617 --> 22:42.920
He's constantly doing favors fr
everyone in the inner circle.

22:43.054 --> 22:45.657
A phone call from Bill could gt
you a great gig in New York.

22:45.790 --> 22:47.592
-I hate them, Linda.
-Monica,

22:47.725 --> 22:49.026
-listen to me.
-I fucking hate them.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.495
-You need to...
-(click)

22:50.628 --> 22:51.763
Oh.

22:51.896 --> 22:53.765
-I can't tell you.
-Okay. Very nice.

22:53.898 --> 22:55.900
-(laughs)
-It's so good.
-(phone ringing)

23:02.907 --> 23:04.942
Hello.

23:05.076 --> 23:07.945
MONICA:
You said to my face
that he would bring me back.

23:08.079 --> 23:10.548
Monica? I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:10.682 --> 23:12.450
You're a liar.
You're both liars.

23:12.584 --> 23:15.620
I can fix this.
We can fix this. I promise.

23:15.753 --> 23:16.788
Stop it! Stop!

23:16.921 --> 23:18.990
(click)

23:27.331 --> 23:29.433
(sighs)

23:30.702 --> 23:33.037
(phone ringing)

23:41.546 --> 23:43.715
BILL:
Who the hell
do you think you are?

23:43.848 --> 23:45.650
You know, Betty didn't come up
out of the Jim Crow South

23:45.783 --> 23:47.084
to work in the damn White House

23:47.218 --> 23:48.586
to be yelled at
by some fucking 24-year-old.

23:48.720 --> 23:51.322
She called me in tears.

23:51.455 --> 23:53.558
She was devastated.
I thought you were a good girl.

23:53.691 --> 23:56.828
Are you kidding?

23:56.961 --> 23:58.095
I've been good.

23:58.229 --> 24:00.264
I've driven myself crazy
trying to be good.

24:00.397 --> 24:03.067
You are the one that promised me
that Bob Nash would take care

24:03.200 --> 24:04.769
of my job, and he didn't.

24:04.902 --> 24:06.571
And then Marsha, you said,
would take care of it.

24:06.704 --> 24:08.606
And now all she's done is lie
and be a bitch to me.

24:08.740 --> 24:11.408
Damn it, Monica. You swore
you wouldn't cause trouble.

24:13.077 --> 24:14.846
You know, if I'd known
this is who you were,

24:14.979 --> 24:16.413
I never would've
gotten involved with you.

24:17.414 --> 24:19.016
Fuck you.

24:19.150 --> 24:20.585
You promised me I could
come back to the White House.

24:20.718 --> 24:23.354
Oh, for God's sake. All I think
about is you and your job.

24:23.487 --> 24:24.856
I'm obsessed with it.

24:24.989 --> 24:27.424
My whole life has become
about finding you a job.

24:28.826 --> 24:30.862
Well, you won't have to deal
with me anymore, so don't worry.

24:30.995 --> 24:32.764
I won't call you,

24:32.897 --> 24:35.767
and I won't ever come to see
you again because I'm leaving.

24:35.900 --> 24:38.169
I'm moving to New York.

24:39.170 --> 24:41.005
That's a big move.

24:42.006 --> 24:44.609
There's no point
in staying here.

24:45.610 --> 24:47.478
Well...

24:47.612 --> 24:50.447
I think it's a great idea.

24:52.183 --> 24:53.250
Do you, um...?

24:55.352 --> 24:57.889
Could you maybe help me,
you know, find something there?

24:58.022 --> 24:59.724
Of course.

24:59.857 --> 25:01.358
I'll do anything I can.

25:03.695 --> 25:05.897
Um, maybe Vernon Jordan

25:06.030 --> 25:08.065
could help me find something
not in government.

25:08.199 --> 25:10.367
I'll call him
first thing tomorrow.

25:12.536 --> 25:15.039
Are we friends?

25:18.209 --> 25:20.578
Yeah.

25:20.712 --> 25:22.780
Okay.

25:24.882 --> 25:26.417
If I leave here,
I'll never see you again.

25:26.550 --> 25:27.852
Oh, come on now.

25:27.985 --> 25:29.854
That's not true.

25:29.987 --> 25:32.857
-Oh, please.
-It isn't.

25:32.990 --> 25:34.592
Really?

25:34.726 --> 25:36.193
Well, I-I'm gonna spend

25:36.327 --> 25:38.562
a lot of time in New York
after I'm done here.

25:40.397 --> 25:42.366
I don't think we're ever going
to hang out in New York.

25:42.499 --> 25:44.568
Of course we will.

25:46.070 --> 25:48.072
Life is long, Monica.

26:07.158 --> 26:09.193
-(knocks)
-VERNON: Come in.

26:11.763 --> 26:13.230
Yeah.

26:13.364 --> 26:15.232
-Monica Lewinsky. (laughs)
-Hi.

26:15.366 --> 26:16.801
-Such a pleasure to meet you.
-No, it's my pleasure.

26:16.934 --> 26:19.103
-It's my pleasure. Come on in.
-Thank you.

26:24.776 --> 26:29.146
Oh. Oh, it's, uh...
it's ostentatious, I know,

26:29.280 --> 26:31.248
but this is D.C.,
and every man needs a wall.

26:31.382 --> 26:33.317
Yours is maybe the most
impressive that I've seen.

26:33.450 --> 26:34.752
Yeah.
Did you say "maybe"?

26:34.886 --> 26:36.654
-(both laugh)
-No, please.

26:36.788 --> 26:39.056
Thank you.

26:44.128 --> 26:47.598
Ah. Hmm.

26:47.732 --> 26:50.567
Yeah, he was barely 30
when we met.

26:50.702 --> 26:52.904
And we recognized ourselves
in each other.

26:53.037 --> 26:56.507
We both grew up Southern
and both grew up poor.

26:56.640 --> 27:00.344
Now, it's a tired old cliché,
but I promise you,

27:00.477 --> 27:03.180
the instant I first spoke
to him, I said to myself,

27:03.314 --> 27:05.983
"That man is going
to be president one day."

27:09.220 --> 27:12.757
So, it's not often
the president calls me directly

27:12.890 --> 27:15.326
about a staffer's job search.

27:16.327 --> 27:18.195
Well, you know the president.

27:18.329 --> 27:20.131
He can be so generous and kind.

27:20.264 --> 27:22.533
Hmm.

27:22.666 --> 27:24.568
What'd you make of the West Wing
when you worked there?

27:25.569 --> 27:27.038
I loved it.

27:27.171 --> 27:28.539
Abraham Lincoln used
to walk around that place.

27:28.672 --> 27:30.041
I mean, it has a glow.

27:30.174 --> 27:32.209
You never take for granted
working there.

27:32.343 --> 27:34.879
Hmm. So, why'd you leave?

27:35.012 --> 27:37.614
Evelyn Lieberman
didn't like me very much.

27:37.749 --> 27:40.051
Oh, Evelyn. She, uh... she
doesn't like me much either.

27:40.184 --> 27:41.719
(Monica laughs)

27:41.853 --> 27:44.055
Anyway, D.C. is great,
but government work is just...

27:44.188 --> 27:45.389
I don't think it's for me.

27:45.522 --> 27:47.558
The bureaucracy
at my level is crazy.

27:47.691 --> 27:50.294
I can barely smile
without 13 people approving it.

27:50.427 --> 27:52.129
-(laughs)
-And I, um...

27:52.263 --> 27:54.565
You know, I was a...
a psych major in college,

27:54.698 --> 27:57.668
so human behavior has always
been of great interest to me.

27:57.802 --> 28:02.073
So I think communications or PR
would be where I should land.

28:02.206 --> 28:04.075
And I'm not sure
if he mentioned,

28:04.208 --> 28:05.910
but I'm looking
to move to New York.

28:06.043 --> 28:09.413
Yes. Now,
you know what's up there

28:09.546 --> 28:12.083
with a big PR department?

28:12.216 --> 28:14.085
Revlon.

28:14.218 --> 28:16.988
And I just so happen to be
on their board of directors.

28:18.555 --> 28:21.258
I think a few
strategically-placed calls could

28:21.392 --> 28:23.260
shake loose an opening

28:23.394 --> 28:25.429
for a bright young woman
like you.

28:25.562 --> 28:27.598
MONICA:
It's so nice to meet

28:27.731 --> 28:29.333
someone genuine in this town.

28:29.466 --> 28:31.102
I can see why you
and the president are friends.

28:31.235 --> 28:33.104
(Vernon laughs)

28:33.237 --> 28:35.072
All right.

28:36.007 --> 28:39.210
If you see him,
will you give him a hug for me?

28:39.343 --> 28:42.279
(laughs)
Yeah, I don't usually
hug other men.

28:42.413 --> 28:44.816
You take care of yourself,
Monica.

28:56.327 --> 28:58.395
LINDA:
So, how'd it go?

28:58.529 --> 29:00.464
MONICA:
You should see his office,
Linda.

29:00.597 --> 29:02.867
He has a picture
with every president ever.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.036
He's a very powerful man.
Did he offer to help?

29:05.169 --> 29:07.038
He said he'd call Revlon
and put in

29:07.171 --> 29:08.472
a good word
with the PR department.

29:08.605 --> 29:10.474
-Well, that's something.
-(laughs)

29:10.607 --> 29:12.877
-Did you tell Bill?
-No, not yet.

29:13.010 --> 29:15.312
Why not? He needs
to follow up with Vernon

29:15.446 --> 29:16.914
immediately.
He owes you this job.

29:17.048 --> 29:18.649
I know, Linda. I got it.

29:18.782 --> 29:20.417
I always thought
I'd be good in PR.

29:20.551 --> 29:22.586
-Really?
-Well, I have some

29:22.719 --> 29:24.922
very good friends in PR
at ABC, NBC, all the networks.

29:25.056 --> 29:26.323
Then you should

29:26.457 --> 29:28.159
-work in PR, girl.
-Well,

29:28.292 --> 29:30.094
there are never any positions
in my level.

29:30.227 --> 29:32.964
(line ringing)

29:35.632 --> 29:36.733
LINDA:
Any news on

29:36.868 --> 29:38.335
-the job front?
-Ugh, no, but

29:38.469 --> 29:40.337
I just got back from the mall,
and I bought you a mixtape

29:40.471 --> 29:42.173
to kick-start your workout plan.

29:42.306 --> 29:44.741
I think you'll like it 'cause
it's songs from your generatio.

29:44.876 --> 29:46.743
What songs?

29:46.878 --> 29:48.445
-"Heard it
Through the Grapevine."
-Okay.

29:48.579 --> 29:49.947
"Stop! In the Name of Love."

29:50.081 --> 29:52.583
-Okay.
-* Who put the bomp *

29:52.716 --> 29:54.685
* In the bomp,
she-bomp, she-bomp? *

29:54.818 --> 29:56.353
Do you like any of those songs?

29:56.487 --> 29:57.821
No, Monica, I don't.

29:58.422 --> 30:00.657
(phone ringing)

30:02.559 --> 30:04.561
(phone ringing)

30:06.330 --> 30:08.199
Hello.

30:08.332 --> 30:10.701
-Hey, what's happening?
-(laughs)

30:10.834 --> 30:13.370
You mean in the hour
since I saw you? Nothing.

30:13.504 --> 30:15.372
Just my hellacious commute.

30:15.506 --> 30:17.008
Ugh. I'm sorry.

30:18.675 --> 30:20.744
(line ringing)

30:21.745 --> 30:23.314
LINDA:
Did you hear from Revlon?

30:23.447 --> 30:25.883
-Of course not. It's probably
not gonna happen.
-Well,

30:26.017 --> 30:27.885
then, Monica, you have
to call the big creep

30:28.019 --> 30:29.120
and hold his feet to the fire.

30:29.253 --> 30:30.554
I know. I'll try. It's just,

30:30.687 --> 30:32.189
he's been hard to get
on the phone these days.

30:34.858 --> 30:36.860
(phone ringing)

30:37.861 --> 30:40.064
(phone ringing)

30:40.197 --> 30:42.299
-Hi.
-MONICA: Hi. How was your day?

30:42.433 --> 30:43.567
-Well, I don't know.
-(phone chimes)

30:43.700 --> 30:44.668
Hold on.
I'm getting another call.

30:44.801 --> 30:45.903
Call me back.

30:46.037 --> 30:47.004
MONICA:
I'm so hungry,

30:47.138 --> 30:48.405
-I could die.
-Well, tomorrow

30:48.539 --> 30:49.740
is bananas and milk, right?

30:49.873 --> 30:51.242
Ugh. Yes.

30:51.375 --> 30:52.509
Well, if you can get by
banana/milk day,

30:52.643 --> 30:54.178
boy, have you got
this thing licked.

30:54.311 --> 30:56.813
Then isn't it two straight days
of beets?

30:56.948 --> 30:58.983
Oh, I'm off beets.
I won't do beets.

30:59.116 --> 31:00.717
(phone ringing)

31:02.987 --> 31:04.421
ALLISON:
Mom, we need two lines.

31:04.555 --> 31:06.757
-No one can call me anymore.
-(phone ringing)

31:06.890 --> 31:09.260
Monica. I was just about
to call you.

31:09.393 --> 31:11.095
Fucking Monica again.

31:11.228 --> 31:13.030
-Language, Allison.
-Mm.

31:13.164 --> 31:14.765
MONICA:
I don't believe for one second

31:14.898 --> 31:16.267
-he's not having an affair.
-LINDA: Who do you think

31:16.400 --> 31:18.535
-he's seeing?
-Uh, Debbie the stewardess.

31:18.669 --> 31:19.703
And of course
there's Streisand.

31:19.836 --> 31:22.106
She gets prettier
as she gets older.

31:22.239 --> 31:23.407
I don't think so.

31:24.675 --> 31:25.943
MONICA:
I just keep calling,
and she says

31:26.077 --> 31:26.944
that he's working, but I know

31:27.078 --> 31:28.379
that's not true.

31:28.512 --> 31:30.581
It's a good thing
you're a glutton for punishment.

31:31.515 --> 31:34.418
(Linda and Monica
speaking indistinctly)

31:36.853 --> 31:39.023
LINDA:
...for the time being, yes.

31:39.156 --> 31:41.025
MONICA:
Ugh.

31:41.158 --> 31:42.393
I'm exhausted.
I'm gonna go to bed.

31:42.526 --> 31:45.029
You said that 15 minutes ago.

31:45.162 --> 31:47.031
I know, but now I'm really
gonna go to bed.

31:47.164 --> 31:49.700
-Okay.
-(sighs)

31:49.833 --> 31:51.868
-Go to bed.
-Oy vey.

31:52.003 --> 31:53.404
I have to be up so early.

31:53.537 --> 31:55.406
(TV playing quietly)

31:55.539 --> 31:58.809
Oh, my God,
I have to go to sleep.

31:58.942 --> 32:01.278
Me, too. Me, too.

32:03.880 --> 32:06.117
-Linda?
-Yeah.

32:08.219 --> 32:10.154
This all has to end.

32:10.287 --> 32:13.457
(sighs)
It really does.

32:14.791 --> 32:16.327
(line ringing)

32:16.460 --> 32:17.728
LINDA:
Monica.

32:17.861 --> 32:20.164
-(groans)
-What's wrong?

32:20.297 --> 32:22.233
Out of nowhere, I get a call
from Bill Richardson.

32:22.366 --> 32:24.001
He's our ambassador
for the United Nations.

32:24.135 --> 32:25.402
Uh, I know. (scoffs)

32:25.536 --> 32:27.771
-Are you serious?
-He heard I was looking

32:27.904 --> 32:30.407
for a job in New York, and
he wants to sit down with me.

32:30.541 --> 32:32.609
About working on his U.N. staff?

32:32.743 --> 32:35.112
Well, that's fabulous.

32:35.246 --> 32:36.613
I want to work at Revlon.

32:36.747 --> 32:38.082
What happened to that?

32:38.215 --> 32:40.584
Maybe Revlon's a no-go.
This is even better.

32:40.717 --> 32:43.020
No, it's not. It'll be like
working at the Pentagon,

32:43.154 --> 32:45.256
-but in New York.
-Well, you can talk

32:45.389 --> 32:46.623
to Bill Richardson about what
you'd want to do there.

32:46.757 --> 32:48.259
That's like saying

32:48.392 --> 32:50.694
if I walk into a nut store,
I can say what nuts I want.

32:50.827 --> 32:52.696
Well, I don't want any nuts,
and I don't fucking like nuts.

32:52.829 --> 32:54.698
So big fucking deal
that I can have the nuts.

32:54.831 --> 32:59.203
Monica, this is very positive.

32:59.336 --> 33:01.538
Clearly the president
made some calls.

33:01.672 --> 33:03.274
Not to me.
I didn't get a call.

33:03.407 --> 33:05.209
(sighs)

33:05.342 --> 33:06.843
What's wrong?

33:08.512 --> 33:12.049
Linda, you have no idea
how hurt I am

33:12.183 --> 33:13.884
that I am not going back
to the White House.

33:14.017 --> 33:15.486
Monica,

33:15.619 --> 33:18.155
I have listened to you
for months.

33:18.289 --> 33:19.656
You're not happy.

33:19.790 --> 33:22.293
Take the job.

33:22.426 --> 33:25.229
At least as a start.
It'll get you to New York.

33:25.362 --> 33:28.399
Linda, he won't even see me
when I'm in the same city

33:28.532 --> 33:30.734
as him, and he-he says
that it'll be better

33:30.867 --> 33:32.636
when he's out of office and tht
we're going to get together

33:32.769 --> 33:34.905
in New York,
but he is full of shit.

33:35.038 --> 33:36.807
And on the tiny chance
that he is not full of shit,

33:36.940 --> 33:38.409
well, then, great.

33:38.542 --> 33:40.544
I have to wait
two years to see him.

33:41.545 --> 33:43.347
Linda, I don't want to go.

33:44.381 --> 33:46.150
-(buzzer sounds on phone)
-(sighs)

33:46.283 --> 33:47.584
Oh, great. That's my pizza.

33:47.718 --> 33:49.153
I'm a wreck. I got to go.

34:05.236 --> 34:07.738
(TV playing quietly)

34:17.648 --> 34:20.284
(sighs)

34:20.417 --> 34:21.552
What is this?

34:21.685 --> 34:23.920
(sighs)

34:29.360 --> 34:31.695
(sighs)

34:34.030 --> 34:35.899
(phone ringing)

34:36.032 --> 34:37.368
(groans)

34:38.369 --> 34:40.604
(sighs)

34:45.442 --> 34:47.311
Hello.

34:47.444 --> 34:49.913
MONICA:
Guess what. He called.

34:50.046 --> 34:52.416
Oh. Great.

34:52.549 --> 34:55.085
Yeah, and he was so nice,
and he said

34:55.219 --> 34:57.154
I don't have
to take the U.N. job and that

34:57.288 --> 34:59.156
Bill Richardson is just
a good person for me to know

34:59.290 --> 35:01.392
and that he's going
to call Vernon and see

35:01.525 --> 35:02.826
what's going on on his end.

35:02.959 --> 35:04.561
So I feel so much better.

35:04.695 --> 35:07.431
(sighs) No, I know. I just need
to make peace with New York.

35:07.564 --> 35:09.666
I just get so freaked out
at the idea of saying goodbye

35:09.800 --> 35:11.134
to him.

35:11.268 --> 35:12.836
Do you think I should go
to the Christmas party?

35:12.969 --> 35:14.771
Maybe I should ask Betty.

35:14.905 --> 35:16.340
Oh, God, I owe Betty
an apology, don't I?

35:16.473 --> 35:18.509
Why would you owe Betty
anything?

35:18.642 --> 35:19.743
Because I was a nightmare.

35:19.876 --> 35:21.178
I mean, I can't believe

35:21.312 --> 35:23.247
-I screamed at her.
-You know what?

35:23.380 --> 35:24.248
Do what you want.

35:24.381 --> 35:25.849
Okay. Why do you sound...?

35:25.982 --> 35:27.284
Because, Monica, I've had it.

35:27.418 --> 35:28.852
One minute,

35:28.985 --> 35:31.688
you're crying about getting
a call from our U.N. ambassador

35:31.822 --> 35:33.290
and saying how much these
terrible people have hurt you.

35:33.424 --> 35:35.459
And the next minute,
you're ecstatic

35:35.592 --> 35:37.194
and saying
you owe Betty an apology.

35:37.328 --> 35:39.196
-Why are you being so intense?
-Do me a favor.

35:39.330 --> 35:42.266
Take your delirium
and your incessant phone calls

35:42.399 --> 35:45.936
and this whole sick situation
and foist it on someone else.

35:46.069 --> 35:47.871
Your mom, your friends, not me.

35:48.004 --> 35:49.706
Linda, what is going...?

35:49.840 --> 35:51.942
(dial tone)

35:58.682 --> 35:59.883
(microwave whirring)

36:00.016 --> 36:02.886
(phone ringing)

36:03.019 --> 36:05.722
MONICA:
Linda, I know
you're listening to this.

36:05.856 --> 36:07.724
-I'm still not sure
why you're so mad at me.
-(ding)

36:07.858 --> 36:10.160
Can you please pick up?
You've met me, right?

36:10.294 --> 36:11.728
You know I'm just going
to keep calling.

36:11.862 --> 36:15.232
-(click, beep)
-LUCIANNE: Linda, it's Luciann.

36:15.366 --> 36:18.635
-What's going on?
Don't keep me waiting.
-(beep)

36:22.873 --> 36:24.941
(muttering)

36:26.543 --> 36:27.544
No.

36:29.880 --> 36:31.548
(sighs)

36:48.899 --> 36:50.901
(typing)

36:52.836 --> 36:55.272
(phone ringing)

36:55.406 --> 36:56.273
Ken Bacon's office.

36:56.407 --> 36:58.675
It's me.

36:58.809 --> 37:00.944
Linda, I'm so glad you called.

37:01.077 --> 37:02.279
(whispering):
Why are you whispering?

37:02.413 --> 37:03.947
Oh, uh, because
I got in trouble earlier

37:04.080 --> 37:06.850
-for making a personal call.
-Is no amount

37:06.983 --> 37:08.619
of hard work enough
for these people?

37:08.752 --> 37:10.120
I know.
Uh, Linda,

37:10.253 --> 37:11.955
I've been worried about you.
I haven't seen you.

37:12.088 --> 37:13.957
I took a sick day.

37:14.090 --> 37:17.294
-Are you sick?
-No.

37:17.428 --> 37:18.762
Oh.

37:21.932 --> 37:23.867
I have to apologize.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.302
You really don't need to.

37:25.436 --> 37:27.037
No.
No, I overreacted.

37:27.170 --> 37:29.706
I've been a terrible friend.

37:29.840 --> 37:31.875
If you want to apologize
to Betty, you should.

37:32.008 --> 37:33.810
I already did. You-you don't
have to. It's okay.

37:33.944 --> 37:37.180
My behavior has been
unacceptable, Monica.

37:39.282 --> 37:40.751
I am such an awful person.

37:40.884 --> 37:42.519
Linda, it's fine.

37:43.554 --> 37:45.422
(sighs)

37:45.556 --> 37:47.624
I have something to confess.

37:51.127 --> 37:53.063
I lost three pounds.

37:53.196 --> 37:54.331
What?

37:54.465 --> 37:55.999
Oh, my God.

37:56.132 --> 37:57.568
I am so proud of you.

37:57.701 --> 37:58.835
You want to come over
and raid my fat closet?

37:58.969 --> 38:00.070
(laughs)

38:00.203 --> 38:02.506
-All right. Well, I got to go.
-Okay.

38:02.639 --> 38:04.708
-Okay, bye-bye.
-Bye.

38:10.647 --> 38:13.249
You would look so nice
in this DKNY.

38:13.384 --> 38:15.018
And this Banana blazer
is a must.

38:15.151 --> 38:17.521
I love them,
but I-I really can't.

38:17.654 --> 38:20.223
Oh, please.
They're yours. Stop it.

38:21.157 --> 38:23.694
Oh, Linda, maybe on a date?

38:23.827 --> 38:26.029
Oh, Monica, please.

38:26.162 --> 38:28.031
(scoffs)
Okay, fine. Your birthday.

38:28.164 --> 38:30.701
I've told you a million times
I don't do birthdays.

38:30.834 --> 38:33.203
-Birthdays are for children.
-Ugh, I don't get it.

38:33.336 --> 38:35.539
Did you have a bad experience
in childhood or something?

38:35.672 --> 38:37.808
I'm German. You have
to bake the cake yourself.

38:37.941 --> 38:41.211
-God, you-you're a mess.
-Okay, I didn't know

38:41.344 --> 38:42.879
-you were gonna come over.
-I mean, really, Monica.

38:43.013 --> 38:44.548
Hangers were invented
for a reason.

38:44.681 --> 38:46.216
Oh, my God, do not touch that.

38:46.349 --> 38:48.819
Will you relax? I've handled
dirty clothing before.

38:48.952 --> 38:53.924
No. Um, this blue dress is, um--
it's really, really dirty.

38:54.925 --> 38:56.793
Uh, you've lost me. (chuckles)

38:56.927 --> 38:59.596
I wore it
the last time I saw Bill.

39:06.537 --> 39:09.406
-Is that...?
-So gross, right?

39:09.540 --> 39:12.409
How did that even get on there?
I thought you said

39:12.543 --> 39:14.911
-he never completed.
-Okay. (laughs)

39:15.045 --> 39:18.081
Our first time together
after the election, he was...

39:18.214 --> 39:21.752
so excited to see me that he,
you know... he finished.

39:21.885 --> 39:23.420
But I didn't even notice.
I mean, no one did.

39:23.554 --> 39:25.589
I went out to dinner
that night with friends.

39:25.722 --> 39:27.758
When I got back home, I changed.

39:27.891 --> 39:30.260
And I, uh, assumed
it was guacamole.

39:30.393 --> 39:31.995
And then I realized...

39:32.128 --> 39:33.764
Are you saving it?

39:33.897 --> 39:36.266
What? No. Ew.
Don't be disgusting. I just

39:36.399 --> 39:37.868
haven't gotten any
of those clothes dry-cleaned

39:38.001 --> 39:39.936
'cause I haven't needed
to wear them. What? Do you get

39:40.070 --> 39:41.772
your clothes dry-cleaned,
like, every day?

39:41.905 --> 39:44.441
-I just... I use Dryel.
-It's so late.

39:44.575 --> 39:45.909
Want to just stay over?

39:47.911 --> 39:49.780
-Sure.
-Okay, good.

39:49.913 --> 39:51.782
-(chuckles)
-Let's get some snacks.

39:51.915 --> 39:53.917
(sighs)

39:56.252 --> 39:59.890
-MONICA:
Have you ever smoked pot?
-LINDA: No.

40:00.023 --> 40:01.391
Um, worst date
you've ever been on.

40:01.525 --> 40:04.961
Oh, God.
I don't know.

40:05.095 --> 40:07.063
-You have to.
-I've been on one date.

40:07.197 --> 40:08.565
It lasted 25 years,

40:08.699 --> 40:10.233
and the short fuck
stopped paying alimony.

40:10.366 --> 40:12.402
(both laugh)

40:12.536 --> 40:16.907
What's yours?
Oh, was it that, um, awful guy

40:17.040 --> 40:19.375
-from the Georgetown party?
-Oh, no. He was okay.

40:19.510 --> 40:21.745
I mean, he was way too
into swing dancing,

40:21.878 --> 40:25.482
but he took me
to a nice bistro, so... (laughs)

40:25.616 --> 40:28.084
-Was it the teacher?
-Andy wasn't a teacher.

40:28.218 --> 40:29.653
He was the drama tech guy.

40:29.786 --> 40:31.087
He was employed
by your high school.

40:31.221 --> 40:32.589
-Yeah.
-So a teacher.

40:32.723 --> 40:36.426
But youngish. Like, 24.
I don't know.

40:36.560 --> 40:37.828
He didn't seem like a teacher.

40:37.961 --> 40:40.096
Linda, you have to understand,

40:40.230 --> 40:42.165
high school for me was...

40:42.298 --> 40:45.569
I mean, whenever I liked a guy,
he never liked me back.

40:45.702 --> 40:48.238
Always, always, he liked
one of my friends instead.

40:48.371 --> 40:50.273
My mom kept saying,

40:50.406 --> 40:53.409
"You know, you're a late
bloomer. Don't worry."

40:53.544 --> 40:55.846
But it sucked
to not be seeing anyone,

40:55.979 --> 40:59.516
so I... I got really
into the drama club,

40:59.650 --> 41:01.184
which, by the way,
Beverly is no joke.

41:01.317 --> 41:03.620
Like, it is
an elite theater program.

41:03.754 --> 41:06.189
-Oh, I'm sure.
-And I started helping out

41:06.322 --> 41:09.159
with the costumes,
and that's how I met Andy.

41:10.326 --> 41:12.195
I didn't really pay attention
to him at first 'cause I knew

41:12.328 --> 41:14.598
-he'd had sex
with one of my friends.
-A student?

41:14.731 --> 41:16.700
-Yeah, but then, um...
-(scoffs)

41:16.833 --> 41:20.370
during tech week
for West Side Story,

41:20.503 --> 41:23.039
he really started
to focus on me.

41:23.173 --> 41:27.510
And he had these incredible
blue eyes, and he was so smart.

41:28.745 --> 41:31.882
He, um... he played me
the original cast recording

41:32.015 --> 41:35.051
of Les Mis in his car.

41:35.185 --> 41:39.122
He explained the whole show to
me, and he had read the novel.

41:39.255 --> 41:42.325
And he talked to me about
how it was different, and then,

41:42.458 --> 41:48.064
one afternoon, he... he even
brought me his paperback

41:48.198 --> 41:50.400
and said that it...

41:50.533 --> 41:52.402
you know, it had been his,
but it was mine now.

41:52.535 --> 41:56.873
Linda, no one had ever taken
an interest in me like that.

41:58.709 --> 42:02.746
I fell completely,
obsessively in love with him.

42:02.879 --> 42:04.748
And then it...
it all just got so chaotic.

42:04.881 --> 42:07.350
What do you mean?

42:07.483 --> 42:09.753
I found out he was engaged.

42:09.886 --> 42:11.922
Suddenly it was an affair.

42:12.055 --> 42:13.924
Oh, God.

42:14.057 --> 42:15.992
I couldn't stop it.

42:16.126 --> 42:18.228
I lost my virginity to him.

42:19.730 --> 42:22.098
I guess, technically, I...

42:22.232 --> 42:24.768
lost it to a camp counselor
when I was 14,

42:24.901 --> 42:26.770
but I guess it doesn't count

42:26.903 --> 42:28.772
because I said "No"
and he pulled out.

42:28.905 --> 42:30.707
Monica, what?

42:30.841 --> 42:32.809
I really thought he loved me.

42:33.844 --> 42:35.946
Then it all just got
really messy.

42:36.079 --> 42:38.448
I mean, he had a baby
with his wife,

42:38.581 --> 42:40.550
and he told me
to make friends with her

42:40.684 --> 42:42.218
because
that would make it easier

42:42.352 --> 42:43.687
for him to have me around.

42:43.820 --> 42:46.056
-That's sick.
-But I did it.

42:46.189 --> 42:49.525
I did anything that he wanted.

42:49.660 --> 42:51.862
When it was time to start
looking at colleges,

42:51.995 --> 42:53.897
he told me
to check out Portland.

42:54.030 --> 42:55.899
So I chose a school in Portland.

42:56.032 --> 42:59.302
And then, a year later,
when he had to leave L.A.

42:59.435 --> 43:01.872
because he had fucked
one too many students,

43:02.005 --> 43:04.040
-guess where
he moved his family.
-No.

43:04.174 --> 43:06.476
I'd been really happy there.

43:06.609 --> 43:10.146
I loved my college,
and I was even dating a little,

43:10.280 --> 43:11.648
and then there was Andy,

43:11.782 --> 43:14.484
just back at the center
of my universe.

43:14.617 --> 43:16.853
I mean, it was like without him
I was nothing.

43:18.621 --> 43:21.391
What can I say? It was my
most significant relationship.

43:21.524 --> 43:23.559
Till Bill.

43:24.695 --> 43:26.562
I guess maybe

43:26.697 --> 43:29.332
they put something in my head,
like this is all I deserve.

43:29.465 --> 43:31.567
Ugh.

43:34.971 --> 43:37.173
SUZANNE SOMERS (on TV):
I used to do aerobics
till I dropped.

43:37.307 --> 43:38.842
Then I found ThighMaster.

43:38.975 --> 43:41.277
Every single time
you squeeze ThighMaster,

43:41.411 --> 43:43.279
you strengthen and tone
right where you need it,

43:43.413 --> 43:45.015
so it's easy to squeeze,

43:45.148 --> 43:47.851
squeeze your way
to shapely hips and thighs.

43:47.984 --> 43:50.620
WOMAN:
I thought I'd never fit
into these jeans again.

43:50.754 --> 43:52.455
Thank you, ThighMaster.

43:52.588 --> 43:54.691
MAN:
I recommend it and use it.

43:54.825 --> 43:56.993
(Somers speaking indistinctly
on TV)

44:09.940 --> 44:12.208
LINDA:
I can't keep doing this.

44:12.342 --> 44:15.712
It's too much for me. I'm done.

44:15.846 --> 44:16.713
LUCIANNE:
Are you sure

44:16.847 --> 44:17.848
you have enough evidence?

44:19.249 --> 44:21.117
She has a blue dress
from the Gap.

44:21.251 --> 44:23.119
She wore it
to a radio address.

44:23.253 --> 44:25.221
Lucy, it's got his semen on it.

44:25.355 --> 44:28.058
She's saving it like a souvenir

44:28.191 --> 44:30.994
I can die now. I finally heard
everything. I'm finished.

44:31.127 --> 44:32.495
Something needs to happen.

44:32.628 --> 44:33.563
Well, do the book.

44:33.696 --> 44:35.231
I can't wait for the book.

44:35.365 --> 44:36.833
This has to end.

44:36.967 --> 44:38.168
It needs to come out.

44:38.301 --> 44:39.736
If Isikoff still won't bite,

44:39.870 --> 44:41.404
I'll call Richard at Page Six.

44:41.537 --> 44:42.739
He'd die to put this in print.

44:42.873 --> 44:45.641
No. No. She can't see me
going to a tabloid.

44:45.776 --> 44:47.677
Dear, we've talked about this.

44:47.811 --> 44:49.746
Well, things have changed.

44:49.880 --> 44:52.582
She has to think I was
compelled. She has to know

44:52.715 --> 44:56.286
-I had no choice.
-Okay, I get it. I get it.

45:00.390 --> 45:03.426
Paula Jones.

45:03.559 --> 45:05.762
Could she help me?

45:05.896 --> 45:07.764
Help you with what?

45:07.898 --> 45:09.465
Dating
within your own bloodline?

45:11.134 --> 45:15.271
Her lawyers are calling
character witnesses on Clinton.

45:15.405 --> 45:18.341
If they make me testify,
this whole thing becomes public.

45:18.474 --> 45:19.776
I love it.

45:19.910 --> 45:21.277
I'll make a few phone calls.

45:21.411 --> 45:23.279
Monica can never find out.

45:23.413 --> 45:25.415
Okay, dear.

45:27.583 --> 45:29.585
(phone ringing)

45:32.355 --> 45:34.891
Lucianne Goldberg,
as I live and breathe.

45:35.025 --> 45:36.526
-To what do I owe this honor?
-(copier beeps)

45:37.760 --> 45:40.263
Are you sitting down?

45:42.765 --> 45:44.801
RICHARD:
You're not going to believe
what I just heard.

45:44.935 --> 45:47.904
There's an intern
in the Casa Blanca

45:48.038 --> 45:51.741
who indulges a certain lothario
with oral sex in the pantry.

45:51.875 --> 45:53.810
There's a real witness
who will testify to it.

45:53.944 --> 45:56.479
-You're kidding.
-(laughing): I kid you not.

45:56.612 --> 45:57.981
What's her name?

45:58.114 --> 45:59.482
Linda Tripp's the name
of the witness.

45:59.615 --> 46:01.651
No, no, no.
What's the intern's name?

46:01.784 --> 46:05.388
Lewisky.
Monica Lewisky.

46:05.521 --> 46:08.324
-You have the number
to the Jones lawyers?
-Yeah.

46:08.458 --> 46:09.625
(beep)

46:11.127 --> 46:13.196
(line ringing)

46:17.467 --> 46:19.469
(typing)

46:34.650 --> 46:36.819
(sighs)

46:41.657 --> 46:44.260
-Mr. Bacon?
-Ms. Lewinsky.

46:44.394 --> 46:46.429
(sighs)
I'm here to inform you that, um,

46:46.562 --> 46:48.698
as of January 1st,
I will no longer be available

46:48.831 --> 46:50.600
to work
for the Department of Defense.

46:50.733 --> 46:52.702
So the day has come.

46:52.835 --> 46:54.704
I'm moving to New York City.

46:54.837 --> 46:57.207
Well, we'll be sad
to lose you, Monica.

46:57.340 --> 46:59.575
What are you going to be doing
in the Big Apple?

47:01.511 --> 47:04.347
Um, I'm going to move on
with my life.

47:34.210 --> 47:36.212
*

47:51.394 --> 47:53.663
(doorbell rings)

47:56.066 --> 47:58.234
(sighs)

48:07.910 --> 48:10.346
Are you Ms. Linda Tripp?

48:10.480 --> 48:12.115
Uh-huh.

48:12.248 --> 48:14.017
This subpoena requires you
to testify

48:14.150 --> 48:17.253
as a witness
in Jones v. Clinton.

48:22.825 --> 48:24.894
-(knock at door)
-(door opens)

48:25.028 --> 48:28.231
Mr. President, the Jones team
faxed over the witness list.

48:28.364 --> 48:30.233
You have a moment to go over it?

48:30.366 --> 48:32.969
-Sure.
-Most of the names are what

48:33.103 --> 48:35.638
we anticipated--
Willey, Flowers.

48:35.771 --> 48:39.442
The only one that didn't sound
familiar was Monica Lewinsky.

48:41.544 --> 48:44.214
I looked into it.
She was a White House intern.

48:44.347 --> 48:46.616
Does that name sound familiar?

48:48.551 --> 48:50.153
Because even if there's
a small chance

48:50.286 --> 48:53.489
that she or any of these women
might pose a problem,

48:53.623 --> 48:55.891
you can tell me.

48:56.026 --> 48:59.329
We can still settle this.

48:59.462 --> 49:01.697
We can make it all go away.

49:04.134 --> 49:06.169
Bob,

49:06.302 --> 49:08.804
do you think I'm fucking crazy?

49:11.407 --> 49:13.409
Mr. President.

49:43.339 --> 49:45.341
*

50:15.371 --> 50:17.373
*
