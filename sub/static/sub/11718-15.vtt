Mark Dunkerly.

He's the president of
Hawaiian Airlines.

06:24.304 --> 06:25.838
Hey, nice to meet you.
How do you do?

06:25.905 --> 06:27.840
Obviously,
we're devastated.

06:27.907 --> 06:28.941
Something like this
has never happened before.

06:29.025 --> 06:30.926
Mr. Dunkerly, we're
going to need

06:30.977 --> 06:32.327
your airline's full
support on this on.

06:32.395 --> 06:33.996
Absolutely. Anything
we can do, Commander.

06:34.063 --> 06:35.347
All right, thank you.

06:35.415 --> 06:36.815
Kono's inside.
All right.

06:36.900 --> 06:38.650
Thanks.

06:43.740 --> 06:45.273
After the flight attendant found
the body in the bathroom,

06:45.325 --> 06:48.327
all the passengers were kept in
their seats until HPD arrived.

06:48.411 --> 06:50.412
They're currently
sequestered in a hangar,

06:50.463 --> 06:51.279
and Chin's with them now.

06:51.331 --> 06:52.614
Who's the victim?

06:52.665 --> 06:53.832
A U.S. marshal.

06:53.917 --> 06:55.450
He was escorting a prisoner
named Sal Painter,

06:55.502 --> 06:57.619
who is not among
the passengers in the hangar.

06:57.670 --> 07:00.539
Okay, which makes him
our primary suspect, right?

07:00.607 --> 07:01.874
Yeah, we also found
a murder weapon,

07:01.941 --> 07:04.343
two plastic knives held
together with a rubber band.

07:04.427 --> 07:06.845
HPD found it
in the lavatory trash.

07:21.694 --> 07:23.829
Danny?

07:27.467 --> 07:28.417
You know this guy?

07:28.484 --> 07:30.118
Yeah.

07:30.170 --> 07:32.120
His name is Dave Collins.

07:32.172 --> 07:33.505
He, uh, worked out of the

07:33.590 --> 07:35.607
U.S. Marshal field office
in New Jersey.

07:37.627 --> 07:39.478
I'm sorry.

07:41.598 --> 07:43.315
He was a buddy of mine;
we kept in touch.

07:44.551 --> 07:46.552
Has three kids.

07:53.993 --> 07:56.094
We got a smashed cell phone.

07:56.162 --> 07:57.696
Kono, uh...

07:57.780 --> 07:59.681
Let's see if
Fong can get something off of it.

07:59.732 --> 08:03.652
Excuse me.
Chin, what've got?

08:03.703 --> 08:04.870
How about another
missing passenger.

08:04.954 --> 08:06.054
Who?

08:06.122 --> 08:07.206
According to
the flight manifest,

08:07.290 --> 08:09.308
a man named Rick McGuire.

08:09.375 --> 08:11.143
No one here remembers
anything unusual about him.

08:11.211 --> 08:12.628
Where was he sitting?

08:12.695 --> 08:14.830
Seat 35G.

08:18.801 --> 08:20.552
Looks like McGuire left
something behind.

08:20.637 --> 08:22.037
Why would he leave
his stuff behind?

08:23.506 --> 08:25.057
Maybe he didn't want to
draw any attention to himself.

08:25.141 --> 08:27.426
Kono, go through this,
see if you can

08:27.493 --> 08:29.595
find anything that'll help us
locate our suspects.

08:29.679 --> 08:33.432
Okay, so, Painter had
an accomplice,

08:33.515 --> 08:35.333
obviously another passenger.

08:35.400 --> 08:36.934
All right, but where are they?

08:37.003 --> 08:40.388
'Cause they didn't get off the
plane five miles up in the air.

08:54.866 --> 08:57.234
I know.

08:59.871 --> 09:01.605
He talking to the vic's wife?

09:01.673 --> 09:03.013
Yeah.

09:03.017 --> 09:04.500
Hey, listen, we get anything
out of that duffle bag

09:04.568 --> 09:07.069
we pulled off the plane?

09:07.121 --> 09:08.070
Not a thing.

09:08.122 --> 09:09.922
No usable prints.
No DNA.

09:09.990 --> 09:12.041
- Hey...
- Here she is.

09:12.092 --> 09:13.793
Yes. Hi.

09:13.861 --> 09:16.179
Wow. Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

09:16.246 --> 09:17.413
It's just a minor sprain.

09:17.464 --> 09:18.431
Here, have a seat.

09:18.515 --> 09:19.232
Oh, I'm good.

09:19.300 --> 09:20.350
Thank you.

09:20.417 --> 09:21.784
Lori, sit down.
You should elevate it.

09:21.852 --> 09:23.936
No, no, thanks, Doc,
I'm fine, really.

09:24.004 --> 09:25.555
All right.

09:25.622 --> 09:27.023
What's up with
the TSA footage?

09:27.090 --> 09:28.725
All right, should be
loaded up by now.

09:30.377 --> 09:33.780
Okay, so that's Collins's flight
just prior to arrival

09:33.847 --> 09:36.299
at the gate.

09:36.367 --> 09:37.567
Look at that.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.369
Okay, so they must've
gone through

09:39.436 --> 09:40.953
the service cart lift in the galley,
- Right.

09:41.038 --> 09:43.639
and accessed the wheel well
through the baggage compartment.

09:43.707 --> 09:44.957
All right,
so the guy on the left

09:45.042 --> 09:46.542
could be the right
build for Painter.

09:46.610 --> 09:47.960
All right, well,
now we know how

09:48.045 --> 09:48.995
they got off of the plane.

09:49.079 --> 09:50.163
What else we got on these two?

09:50.230 --> 09:52.965
Uh, well, HPD arrested
Painter last year

09:53.050 --> 09:54.784
for robbery and assault.

09:54.835 --> 09:55.985
Evidently, he liked hitting
high roller poker games

09:56.053 --> 09:57.487
all over the Island.

09:57.554 --> 09:59.806
Unfortunately, he skipped
town before sentencing.

10:01.458 --> 10:03.242
He was also the chief suspect

10:03.310 --> 10:05.895
in similar incidents in
Chicago and New York,

10:05.963 --> 10:08.765
which is where he was rearrested
and extradited back to Hawaii.

10:08.832 --> 10:09.799
Okay, good.

10:09.850 --> 10:11.484
What about the other guy?

10:12.870 --> 10:14.520
Rick McGuire.

10:14.605 --> 10:18.608
Resides in Westchester County,
New York, no criminal record,

10:18.659 --> 10:20.276
But he makes a lot
of trips to O'ahu.

10:20.327 --> 10:22.078
Eight times in the
past year alone.

10:23.964 --> 10:25.081
This guy's five-nine.

10:25.149 --> 10:26.315
Yeah, so what?

10:26.367 --> 10:28.201
- How tall is Painter?
- Five-nine.

10:28.285 --> 10:29.652
Kono, uh, come back

10:29.703 --> 10:32.672
in the footage here to the piece
where the guys are side by side.

10:35.376 --> 10:37.543
Oh, I see-- how can

10:37.628 --> 10:39.829
they both be five-nine when
this guy's clearly a half a foot

10:39.880 --> 10:41.447
- taller than the other one?
- Exactly.

10:41.515 --> 10:43.633
Whoever got off the plane with
Painter was not Rick McGuire.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.835
We need to find out
who the real Rick McGuire is,

10:45.886 --> 10:47.002
and who this guy

10:47.054 --> 10:48.187
who's impersonating
him now is.

10:48.272 --> 10:49.472
Copy.

10:49.523 --> 10:50.890
Danny and I are gonna
stay focused on Painte

10:50.974 --> 10:52.058
Now, tell me about him.

10:52.142 --> 10:53.226
Does he have anybody
on the Island?

10:53.310 --> 10:54.644
Any friends, any family,
anybody who could

10:54.695 --> 10:56.011
help him
hide out while he's here?

10:56.063 --> 10:57.413
No family, no known associates.

10:57.481 --> 10:58.931
Okay, what about enemies?

10:58.999 --> 11:00.683
You know, maybe he's looking
for payback.

11:00.734 --> 11:02.418
The main witness
in the trial

11:02.486 --> 11:03.986
against him was a woman
named Holly Malone.

11:04.037 --> 11:05.955
She ran the high stakes
poker games that he hit.

11:06.022 --> 11:07.156
We're going downtown.

11:07.207 --> 11:08.474
Let's go talk to her.

11:08.542 --> 11:10.276
She's the only link
we got to Painter.

11:11.912 --> 11:13.830
♪

11:32.199 --> 11:33.850
Officers.

11:33.901 --> 11:36.135
Everything is on
the up-and-up here.

11:36.203 --> 11:37.720
This is a charity event.

11:37.771 --> 11:38.771
We've got seats available,

11:38.856 --> 11:39.956
if you'd like to play.

11:40.023 --> 11:42.308
The buy-in is $50,000.

11:42.376 --> 11:44.444
Oh, is that all? You got 50?
I don't... on me, no.

11:44.528 --> 11:46.696
I, uh, I actually want to send
my kid to college one day.

11:48.699 --> 11:50.149
Come over here for a second.

11:52.953 --> 11:54.904
Sal Painter--
we think you know him.

11:54.955 --> 11:56.906
He's back
on the Island.

11:56.974 --> 11:59.826
He killed a U.S. marshal,
and he escaped custody.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.711
I see.

12:01.762 --> 12:04.246
Um, what-what is Five-O planning
on doing about that?

12:04.298 --> 12:06.382
Well, that depends on how
helpful you plan on being

12:06.433 --> 12:07.416
with us today, Ms. Malone.

12:07.484 --> 12:09.552
We want to know
who he ran with.

12:09.603 --> 12:11.053
Somebody on the Island
may be harboring him.

12:11.104 --> 12:13.272
I know who his partner was.

12:13.357 --> 12:15.057
Um, one of my dealers-- Bronco.

12:15.125 --> 12:17.527
He leaked the locations
of the games to Painter.

12:17.594 --> 12:19.262
Bronco.

12:19.329 --> 12:20.563
Yeah, it's Painter's cousin.

12:20.614 --> 12:21.931
Okay.

12:21.982 --> 12:22.999
Where do we find Bronco?

12:23.066 --> 12:24.567
You can check
the Ali Mani Motel.

12:24.618 --> 12:25.735
That-That was their crash pad

12:25.786 --> 12:27.737
<i>on the Windward side.</i>

12:29.490 --> 12:31.524
Kono, what'd you find?

12:31.592 --> 12:34.110
Rick McGuire-- the real one--

12:34.178 --> 12:35.538
he died two years ago
in New York.

12:35.539 --> 12:36.636
Excellent.

12:36.661 --> 12:38.705
Okay, which means
Sal Painter's accomplice

12:39.099 --> 12:41.033
- stole McGuire's identity.
- Which he used

12:41.101 --> 12:43.619
to purchase and register
a Crown Vic in Oahu.

12:43.687 --> 12:44.787
All right, good.
We got an address

12:44.838 --> 12:45.922
attached to the registration?

12:45.973 --> 12:47.456
It's a vacant lot.

12:47.508 --> 12:49.192
Clever.

12:49.259 --> 12:50.343
Okay, all right,

12:50.427 --> 12:52.378
not your average
idiot criminal mentality.

12:52.446 --> 12:54.247
Can't wait to meet this guy.

12:56.483 --> 12:59.218
I don't have anyone here
by the name of Bronco.

12:59.286 --> 13:00.753
Is that his real name?

13:00.821 --> 13:03.305
Uh, what about this guy, ma'am?

13:03.357 --> 13:04.857
Have you seen this man around?

13:04.942 --> 13:06.058
Yes. Mr. Painter.

13:06.126 --> 13:08.044
Room 224-A.

13:08.111 --> 13:09.362
- I think he's there now.
- Okay.

13:09.446 --> 13:10.913
Would you like me
to call him for you?

13:10.981 --> 13:12.114
No, no. We want to surprise him.

13:12.165 --> 13:13.916
Thank you.

13:16.920 --> 13:18.187
Painter!

13:20.641 --> 13:21.357
Painter!

13:36.823 --> 13:39.108
Come on.

13:39.175 --> 13:40.593
Huh?

13:40.661 --> 13:42.645
Where's your partner? Huh?
Where's your partner?

13:42.696 --> 13:43.563
I don't have a partner!

13:43.647 --> 13:44.513
You don't have a partner. Here.

13:45.666 --> 13:47.600
Huh?

13:47.668 --> 13:48.985
Hey, listen to me. Hey, hey!

13:49.036 --> 13:50.686
Listen to me. I need the name
of your accomplice.

13:50.737 --> 13:52.922
Your accomplice, the guy that
helped you kill Dave Collins

13:52.990 --> 13:53.773
and escape custody.

13:53.840 --> 13:54.857
I don't know.

13:54.908 --> 13:55.691
You don't know...?

13:57.678 --> 13:59.962
Oh, Danny, if
we drown him,

14:00.030 --> 14:01.447
he won't be able to
tell us anything.

14:01.515 --> 14:04.166
Hey. I'm trying to drown him. He
killed a friend of mine, okay?

14:04.217 --> 14:05.868
Huh? Where is he?

14:05.919 --> 14:07.837
Where is he?

14:07.888 --> 14:09.171
I don't know.
I swear!

14:09.222 --> 14:11.624
Before this morning, I never saw
the guy in my life!

14:24.069 --> 14:26.537
You guys seem to have a
listening comprehension problem.

14:26.622 --> 14:28.573
I don't know any
Rick McGuire.

14:28.657 --> 14:30.024
Okay, if you don't
know this guy,

14:30.075 --> 14:31.326
why would he help you escape?

14:31.377 --> 14:32.744
Told me he'd been in my shoes.

14:32.828 --> 14:34.829
That was good enough for me.

14:34.880 --> 14:36.180
Okay, well, I'll tell you who

14:36.248 --> 14:37.365
it wasn't good for.

14:37.416 --> 14:39.117
U.S. Marshal Dave Collins.

14:39.184 --> 14:41.369
Look, I didn't kill
the guy, okay?

14:41.420 --> 14:44.455
Last I saw the marshal,
he was heading to the john

14:44.523 --> 14:46.624
to make a call, and
he never came back.

14:46.692 --> 14:48.443
And how long was that
before you landed?

14:49.895 --> 14:52.213
15, maybe 20 minutes.

14:52.264 --> 14:54.816
He was getting all antsy.

14:54.883 --> 14:56.451
Kept looking around,
like he was

14:56.518 --> 14:58.052
checking somebody out
a few rows in front of us.

14:58.103 --> 15:00.188
Okay, who was
he checking out-- McGuire?

15:00.239 --> 15:02.390
No clue. All I know

15:02.441 --> 15:03.858
is, a couple minutes
before we land,

15:03.909 --> 15:05.994
this guy comes up
and says he can help me.

15:06.061 --> 15:08.529
Then he unlocks my leg shackles,
like he's my best friend.

15:08.580 --> 15:10.365
Well, how did he know
how to do that?

15:10.416 --> 15:12.000
I didn't ask, and I didn't care.

15:12.067 --> 15:13.951
I followed him to
the back of the plane,

15:14.036 --> 15:16.070
he got us down
into the baggage compartment.

15:16.121 --> 15:17.822
Next thing I know,
the plane lands,

15:17.890 --> 15:19.957
and he's leading us out
of the wheel well.

15:20.042 --> 15:21.909
That was the last time
I saw him.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.744
All right, did he say
where he was going?

15:23.796 --> 15:26.547
No. All he said was
he had work to do.

15:26.598 --> 15:29.183
- What kind of work?
- We didn't exactly swap life stories.

15:29.251 --> 15:31.052
Okay, but he must have
said something.

15:31.103 --> 15:32.136
Why he killed Collins,
where he was going.

15:32.221 --> 15:33.304
Something. He must have
said something.

15:33.389 --> 15:34.672
No. The guy hardly
said a word.

15:34.740 --> 15:36.757
He was all calm and cool.

15:38.444 --> 15:41.829
Only time he lost it
was when he dropped that key.

15:41.897 --> 15:43.648
That really
pissed him off.

15:43.732 --> 15:45.433
Wait a minute. What key?
What are you talking about?

15:47.403 --> 15:50.154
He couldn't open the hatch
to the cargo hold,

15:50.239 --> 15:53.858
so he used this key
to pry it open.

15:53.926 --> 15:56.944
It worked, but the key slipped,
and fell into the hold.

15:56.995 --> 15:58.463
All right, we got to call Kono.

15:58.547 --> 16:00.281
Have her search the hold
for that key.

16:00.332 --> 16:02.083
We get a print off it,
maybe we can find out

16:02.134 --> 16:03.117
who McGuire really is.

16:09.842 --> 16:11.959
All right, if what
Painter told us is true,

16:12.010 --> 16:13.928
Collins recognizes this
McGuire guy on the plane...

16:13.979 --> 16:15.263
From where, we don't know.
Right.

16:15.314 --> 16:16.481
McGuire knows he's
been compromised.

16:16.565 --> 16:18.416
He kills the marshal.
That part makes sense.

16:18.484 --> 16:19.600
Until he unshackles Painter.

16:19.651 --> 16:21.235
Why help a guy
you don't know?

16:21.303 --> 16:23.738
Probably so we'd spin our wheels
tracking the escaped fugitive

16:23.805 --> 16:25.523
instead of looking for
some random missing passenger.

16:25.607 --> 16:27.216
Buys himself some time
and throws us off.

16:27.241 --> 16:28.008
Right.

16:28.009 --> 16:29.627
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:29.695 --> 16:30.811
Just got off the phone
with Kono.

16:30.863 --> 16:32.313
She get the key that
Painter was talking about?

16:32.364 --> 16:34.065
Yeah. She's on her way
to Fong's to drop it off,

16:34.133 --> 16:35.216
but she sent a shot of it.

16:35.284 --> 16:36.901
Serial number

16:36.969 --> 16:38.619
on the key traces back
to a private mailbox

16:38.670 --> 16:39.871
at Mailbox Dispatch

16:39.938 --> 16:41.289
near Diamond Head.

16:41.340 --> 16:42.533
Services high-end
beach houses in Kahala.

16:42.558 --> 16:43.007
Okay.

16:43.008 --> 16:45.126
- We have an address?
- Uh, let me look it up.

16:51.633 --> 16:54.152
Okay.

16:54.219 --> 16:56.421
Find out who owns that box,
we track down McGuire.

16:56.488 --> 16:58.973
- I'll go check it out.
- Oh, no, no, no, gimpy.

16:59.024 --> 17:01.309
Please, let me.
I got this one, okay?

17:01.360 --> 17:03.010
Thanks.

17:03.061 --> 17:04.845
See? Chivalry isn't dead.

17:04.896 --> 17:06.614
I carried you
down a mountain.

17:12.538 --> 17:14.321
Hey, Charlie?

17:14.388 --> 17:16.824
Found this in the cargo hold
of our crime scene.

17:16.875 --> 17:19.911
Maybe you can get a print or
DNA or something off of it.

17:19.994 --> 17:21.878
Find out who this
Rick McGuire really is.

17:21.964 --> 17:23.696
Thanks, Kono.
I'll get right on it.

17:23.749 --> 17:25.583
Is that Dave
Collins's phone?

17:25.666 --> 17:27.701
Oh, yeah. I managed
to restore the data from it.

17:27.752 --> 17:29.454
Just reconstructing
the call log now.

17:30.722 --> 17:33.040
Looks like

17:33.091 --> 17:35.042
right before the phone
was smashed, he was trying

17:35.093 --> 17:37.478
to make a call,
but he never got to hit send.

17:37.546 --> 17:39.147
Well, who was he
trying to call?

17:39.214 --> 17:40.714
Pulling up the number now.

17:42.684 --> 17:44.552
Wait a minute.
That's Danny's number.

17:44.603 --> 17:46.354
Did he know Collins?

17:46.405 --> 17:48.689
Yeah.

17:48.740 --> 17:50.691
Why was Collins
trying to call Danny

17:50.742 --> 17:52.760
right before he was killed?

17:53.745 --> 17:56.647
Paperwork says the box belongs

17:56.715 --> 17:58.649
to a Rick McGuire.

17:58.717 --> 18:00.968
- You got a billing address?
- Oh, yeah.

18:01.036 --> 18:04.205
It's another private mailbox
in New Jersey.

18:04.256 --> 18:06.073
New Jersey, huh?

18:07.726 --> 18:10.645
But you know that tampering with
the mail is a federal offense.

18:10.712 --> 18:12.513
Yeah, of course I know that.
I'm a cop.

18:12.581 --> 18:13.747
You got a customer over there.

18:13.799 --> 18:15.800
Go deal with her.

18:16.902 --> 18:19.704
Mm-hmm.

18:38.957 --> 18:42.293
Hey, Steve,
I got an address on McGuire.

19:00.612 --> 19:02.947
Rick McGuire,
Five-O! Open up.

19:07.152 --> 19:09.086
Clear.

19:33.812 --> 19:34.745
Coming in.

19:34.813 --> 19:35.963
Come in.

19:37.349 --> 19:38.966
There's dust everywhere.

19:39.017 --> 19:40.701
Doesn't look like

19:40.802 --> 19:42.186
anyone's stayed
here in a while.

19:48.827 --> 19:49.877
One more spot to check.

20:06.712 --> 20:08.579
Got something?

20:08.664 --> 20:10.164
I don't know.

20:15.921 --> 20:18.389
Oh, my God.

20:23.679 --> 20:24.762
That's Grace.

20:24.846 --> 20:26.731
And Rachel.

20:28.350 --> 20:29.984
And Danny and Stan.

20:30.051 --> 20:32.153
McGuire had them all
under surveillance.

20:32.220 --> 20:34.655
Why? Who the hell is this guy?

20:43.398 --> 20:44.582
Good contact, Grace.

20:44.650 --> 20:46.350
Excuse me?

20:46.418 --> 20:48.052
Grace Williams?

20:50.055 --> 20:52.840
I'm Officer McGuire.
I'm here to pick up Grace.

20:52.907 --> 20:55.509
- Is everything all right, Officer?
- Her father had a little accident.

20:55.577 --> 20:56.677
Is he okay?

20:56.745 --> 20:57.845
Yeah, sweetie,
he's okay.

20:57.912 --> 21:00.131
I just got to take you
to the hospital, all right?

21:01.350 --> 21:04.585
Where's my mom, or Uncle Steve?

21:04.636 --> 21:07.855
They're both with him at the
hospital, waiting for you.

21:07.922 --> 21:09.757
I don't want you to worry,
all right? He's okay.

21:09.808 --> 21:13.861
I'm not supposed
to go with strangers.

21:13.928 --> 21:15.446
I'm not a stranger.

21:15.530 --> 21:16.897
I'm a policeman.

21:16.948 --> 21:18.566
And I'm also an old
friend of your dad's.

21:18.650 --> 21:20.384
You are?

21:20.452 --> 21:21.869
Uh-huh.

21:21.936 --> 21:23.821
You know that...
your old house in New Jersey,

21:23.905 --> 21:26.273
the one up on, um,
Laurel Forest Circle?

21:26.324 --> 21:28.442
The one with
the bad garage door

21:28.493 --> 21:29.943
that used to drive
your father crazy?

21:29.995 --> 21:31.879
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

21:31.946 --> 21:33.714
So why don't we go see
your daddy, okay?

21:37.302 --> 21:38.118
It's okay, Grace.

21:53.042 --> 21:54.175
<i>Hey.</i>

21:54.226 --> 21:55.530
You find anything
at McGuire's place?

21:55.531 --> 21:57.649
Danny, Danny,
where are Rachel and Grace?

21:57.716 --> 22:00.568
Uh, Grace should be at a tennis
lesson right now. Why?

22:00.653 --> 22:01.686
Pacific Club.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.822
Okay, Danny, listen
to me, all right?

22:03.889 --> 22:07.075
McGuire's been
stalking your family.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.943
Hold on-- what?
What'd you just say?

22:09.028 --> 22:09.894
Okay.

22:09.945 --> 22:11.395
We found photos in his computer.

22:11.447 --> 22:13.848
We found photos
of Rachel, of Grace,

22:13.916 --> 22:15.166
of all you guys.

22:15.234 --> 22:16.701
Whoa, whoa, slow down.
What are you talking about?

22:16.752 --> 22:18.453
- Thank you.
- Steve? Steve?

22:18.537 --> 22:21.072
Tennis instructor says a uniform
picked up Grace 30 minutes ago.

22:21.123 --> 22:22.907
Hold on, hold on,
whoa, whoa, whoa. What uniform?

22:22.958 --> 22:25.093
What the hell are you
talking about, Steve?

22:25.177 --> 22:26.244
Danny...

22:26.295 --> 22:27.362
This is Rachel
calling me right now.

22:27.463 --> 22:29.413
Do not move;
I'll call you right back.

22:29.465 --> 22:32.400
Rachel, where are you
and where's Grace?

22:32.468 --> 22:34.285
Uh, well, I was going to ask you
the same thing.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.004
You sent someone to
pick her up? Are you hurt?

22:36.071 --> 22:37.772
No, I'm fine.
Listen to me.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.440
I want you to go to HPD
right now, you hear me?

22:39.525 --> 22:41.592
- Danny, what's happened?
- Rachel, listen to me.

22:41.644 --> 22:43.761
Go to HPD, do exactly what
I tell you to do, okay?

22:43.813 --> 22:45.580
Danny, where is Grace?

22:45.648 --> 22:47.598
She's calling me right now,
on the other line.

22:47.650 --> 22:48.700
Go straight to HPD.

22:48.767 --> 22:50.702
You hear what I said?

22:50.769 --> 22:52.620
Grace?
Baby, can you hear me?

22:52.705 --> 22:54.906
Where are you? Are you okay?

22:56.792 --> 22:58.442
Grace?

22:58.494 --> 23:00.295
You know, I'm surprised.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.881
I thought Manhattan was the only
island you'd ever set foot on.

23:02.948 --> 23:06.835
Listen to me, listen to me,
you son of a bitch.

23:06.919 --> 23:09.170
Whoever this is, if you touch
my daughter, you lay a finger

23:09.255 --> 23:11.055
on her, I swear to God
I'll kill you, you hear me?

23:11.123 --> 23:13.842
Hey, is that any way to talk
to your training officer?

23:13.926 --> 23:15.977
Why don't you just
take it down a notch, D.

23:17.930 --> 23:19.781
Rick Peterson...

23:22.568 --> 23:24.352
Hey, sweetie,

23:24.436 --> 23:25.970
I want you to say hello
to Daddy, okay?

23:26.021 --> 23:26.971
Okay.

23:27.022 --> 23:28.022
Danno?

23:29.158 --> 23:30.975
The policeman said you were
in the hospital,

23:31.026 --> 23:32.443
and we're coming to see you.

23:32.494 --> 23:33.978
Hey, monkey. You okay?

23:34.029 --> 23:35.864
Can you look around and tell me
where you are right now?

23:37.933 --> 23:38.950
Hey.

23:40.419 --> 23:41.836
Your phone is cloned.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.655
So any calls you
make or any calls you receive,

23:44.707 --> 23:46.490
I'm gonna know about.

23:46.542 --> 23:47.658
Uh, Rick, just please...

23:47.710 --> 23:49.660
just tell me
what you want, Rick.

23:49.712 --> 23:50.678
I'll do anything
you tell me to do.

23:50.763 --> 23:51.662
Just tell me what you want.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.686
Don't answer that.

23:58.771 --> 24:02.023
Rick, you got a beef with me,

24:02.107 --> 24:04.192
you can come, you can put
a bullet right in my head.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.461
Just, please, I'm begging you,
let my daughter go.

24:06.528 --> 24:08.296
Listen, when I
hang up the phone,

24:08.364 --> 24:09.981
you're gonna take your cell
and your gun,

24:10.032 --> 24:11.633
and you're gonna
throw them out the window.

24:11.700 --> 24:14.385
And then I want you to go
to Halekauwila and South.

24:14.453 --> 24:15.603
There's a bus bench...
Okay.

24:15.671 --> 24:17.622
...with a disposable phone
taped underneath.

24:17.689 --> 24:19.690
You're gonna go there,
you're gonna get it,

24:19.742 --> 24:20.825
and you're gonna wait

24:20.876 --> 24:21.859
for my phone call.

24:21.911 --> 24:23.294
Okay. Uh...

24:23.362 --> 24:25.463
I'll do what you say.
Just please...

24:25.530 --> 24:27.198
please don't hurt my daughter,
Rick. I'll do anything.

24:27.249 --> 24:28.316
Just please,
please don't hurt her.

24:28.384 --> 24:30.151
Oh, D.

24:30.219 --> 24:32.086
Whatever happens to Grace,
that's...

24:32.171 --> 24:34.172
It's all...
it's all on you, buddy.

24:35.374 --> 24:36.557
You act like a smart guy,

24:36.642 --> 24:38.893
you don't do
what I tell you to do...

24:40.229 --> 24:42.430
...and then sweet, beautiful
little Gracie dies.

24:43.632 --> 24:45.516
Now, do we understand
each other?

24:45.567 --> 24:47.902
Yes. Yes.
I understand perfectly.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.270
Good.

24:49.355 --> 24:51.522
Because we're only
gonna play this one way, D.

24:51.573 --> 24:53.408
I've had a long, long time

24:53.492 --> 24:55.893
to think about how
I was going to make you suffer

24:55.945 --> 24:57.528
like you did to me.

24:57.579 --> 24:59.013
So you better drive fast, kid,

24:59.081 --> 25:00.665
because you got 11 minutes.

25:00.732 --> 25:02.517
All right.
Ready to go?

25:16.598 --> 25:17.882
Hey.

25:17.933 --> 25:19.701
Hey.
Okay, Rachel's safe.

25:19.768 --> 25:22.387
She's at HPD headquarters
with the baby.

25:22.438 --> 25:24.272
HPD squad car
is watching her house.

25:24.356 --> 25:27.025
Also put out a MAILE AMBER Alert
with a description of Grace.

25:27.092 --> 25:28.893
Okay.
Anybody heard from Danny yet?

25:28.944 --> 25:30.795
He's not answering his cell.
Nothing yet.

25:32.431 --> 25:34.315
Okay. Okay.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.117
All right, all right, all right,
all right, all right.

25:36.185 --> 25:37.452
Kono, what
do you got?

25:37.519 --> 25:39.887
Chin said that Fong
pulled a print off the laptop

25:39.955 --> 25:41.456
you got at McGuire's place.
Okay.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.157
We got a hit-- Rick Peterson.

25:43.242 --> 25:44.909
He's an ex-cop from New Jersey.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.494
Cop from New Jersey?

25:46.578 --> 25:48.296
Does Danny know this guy?

25:48.380 --> 25:50.798
Yeah, Danny put him in prison.

26:40.282 --> 26:41.816
Rick.

26:41.884 --> 26:44.168
I'm here. Please...
don't do anything stupid.

26:44.236 --> 26:45.636
Okay? Please don't hurt her.

26:45.704 --> 26:47.388
Okay? Please.

26:47.473 --> 26:49.190
You sound a little winded,
partner.

26:49.274 --> 26:51.225
Is island life making you soft?

26:51.293 --> 26:52.677
Listen to me. Please, Rick.

26:52.745 --> 26:54.178
I know...

26:54.246 --> 26:56.180
I can imagine
what life in prison

26:56.231 --> 26:57.799
must have been like for a cop.

26:57.866 --> 26:58.900
You know?

26:58.984 --> 27:00.101
What do you know, D?

27:01.503 --> 27:02.954
Listen to me, Rick.

27:03.021 --> 27:05.273
I did what I thought was right.

27:05.340 --> 27:07.275
You understand me? I did
the only thing that I could do.

27:07.342 --> 27:09.961
Yeah, what you did...
what you did was destroy

27:10.028 --> 27:11.963
every beautiful thing
I had in my life.

27:12.030 --> 27:14.098
Every beautiful thing
in my life, and I swear to God

27:14.166 --> 27:16.134
I'm going to do the same to you.

27:25.561 --> 27:26.894
In 2001, Sergeant Rick
Peterson was arrested

27:26.979 --> 27:28.712
for stealing money and
half a key of coke

27:28.764 --> 27:30.014
from a crime scene.

27:30.065 --> 27:32.617
This is video from
Peterson's criminal trial.

27:32.684 --> 27:35.236
Officer Williams,
is this the first time

27:35.304 --> 27:36.704
you witnessed
Sergeant Peterson

27:36.772 --> 27:39.590
unlawfully removing evidence
from a crime scene?

27:39.658 --> 27:41.826
You're under oath,
Officer Williams.

27:41.894 --> 27:44.662
No, it was not
the first time.

27:44.729 --> 27:47.615
What sort of things
did Sergeant Peterson take?

27:47.699 --> 27:51.902
Drugs, guns, money.

27:51.954 --> 27:54.172
Danny was the key
prosecution witness.

27:54.239 --> 27:55.957
Peterson served
ten years,

27:56.008 --> 27:57.375
and he was released
seven months ago.

27:57.426 --> 27:58.493
This whole thing's
about revenge.

28:00.562 --> 28:02.913
Dave Collins recognized
Rick Peterson on that plane.

28:02.965 --> 28:06.050
He was calling to warn Danny,
and that's what got him killed.

28:06.101 --> 28:07.468
And then Peterson threw
Sal Painter into the wind

28:07.553 --> 28:09.554
to send us on a
wild goose chase.

28:09.605 --> 28:11.606
It bought him enough time
to put his plan in motion.

28:11.690 --> 28:12.756
Okay. HPD just found
Danny's phone

28:12.808 --> 28:14.358
and gun along the
Ala Wai Canal.

28:14.426 --> 28:16.477
Which means Peterson has already
made contact with Danny

28:16.562 --> 28:17.812
and he's controlling him now.

28:17.896 --> 28:19.814
All right, Lori, listen to me.
I need you to hook

28:19.898 --> 28:21.983
into the Camaro's police GPS
and get me a location.

28:22.067 --> 28:23.117
Okay?
Okay.

28:23.202 --> 28:24.852
Kono, get a description
of Peterson over to HPD

28:24.920 --> 28:26.604
and have them add it
to the MAILE AMBER Alert.

28:26.655 --> 28:27.822
Then go down to the crime lab,

28:27.906 --> 28:29.290
and if there's anything
to find on that laptop,

28:29.408 --> 28:31.576
you find it, okay?
Find it, find it, find it.

28:33.629 --> 28:34.996
<i>Where are you?</i>

28:35.080 --> 28:37.081
I just crossed Punahou Street.

28:37.132 --> 28:38.449
All right.

28:38.500 --> 28:41.219
I want you to drive to the
entrance of Diamond Head Crater.

28:41.286 --> 28:42.370
You got 18 minutes.

28:42.437 --> 28:44.038
And, D,

28:44.106 --> 28:46.257
you turn left instead of right,

28:46.308 --> 28:48.526
you stop anywhere,

28:48.594 --> 28:50.478
you try to call
your Five-O buddies,

28:50.562 --> 28:51.929
then your daughter dies.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.015
You got that?

28:54.099 --> 28:55.499
Yes.

29:07.079 --> 29:09.530
All right, looks like Danny's
four miles ahead of us.

29:09.615 --> 29:12.083
Make a left at the next light.
All right.

29:18.123 --> 29:19.457
Kono, what do you got?

29:19.508 --> 29:21.992
So Peterson tapped into Danny
and Rachel's voice mails

29:22.044 --> 29:23.711
and downloaded them
onto his computer.

29:23.779 --> 29:24.879
It looks like he was focused

29:24.963 --> 29:26.247
on one message
from a few months ago.

29:26.315 --> 29:27.848
Listen to this.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.450
Rachel, uh, it's Danny.

29:29.518 --> 29:31.252
Uh, listen to me.

29:31.320 --> 29:32.970
Uh, I don't... I don't care

29:33.021 --> 29:35.106
if the baby is mine
or if it's Stan's.

29:35.173 --> 29:37.108
I love you, okay?

29:37.175 --> 29:38.509
And I-I just feel in my heart

29:38.560 --> 29:40.478
that there-there's
still a shot, okay?

29:40.529 --> 29:42.346
We have a chance.
And this is ridiculous.

29:42.397 --> 29:43.848
I'm doing this on a voice mail.

29:43.916 --> 29:45.249
Will you please call me back?

29:45.317 --> 29:47.785
That's all I can find.

29:47.852 --> 29:49.270
Listen to me.
Kono, you go find Rachel.

29:49.338 --> 29:51.656
I don't care if they're wearing
an HPD uniform or not--

29:51.707 --> 29:52.940
nobody gets in to see her.

29:53.008 --> 29:55.025
Okay?
Yeah, you got it.

30:16.932 --> 30:18.666
Hello, partner.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.724
You look good.

30:34.106 --> 30:35.890
I'll take that gun.

30:36.909 --> 30:38.443
Where's Grace?

30:38.527 --> 30:40.445
Grace is safe.

30:40.529 --> 30:42.280
Gun.

30:42.364 --> 30:44.866
I dumped the gun
like you told me to.

30:44.917 --> 30:46.000
I'm talking about the gun

30:46.068 --> 30:47.401
that you took out
of your ankle holster.

30:47.453 --> 30:48.620
All right?
Now, don't be a wiseass.

30:48.704 --> 30:49.904
Give me the gun.

30:49.955 --> 30:51.956
I don't know what you're
talking about. Huh?

30:52.024 --> 30:55.260
Now, I know you don't care
what happens to you,

30:55.344 --> 30:58.246
but trust me-- if you die,
Gracie's going to die.

30:58.297 --> 31:01.015
Now, give me the gun
and stop playing around!

31:02.584 --> 31:04.352
Listen to me, Rick.

31:04.419 --> 31:06.271
I'm going to kill you.

31:06.355 --> 31:08.807
I swear to God that I
am going to kill you.

31:08.891 --> 31:10.225
You understand me?
Good. Good.

31:10.276 --> 31:12.360
You stay angry, 'cause if memory
serves me correctly,

31:12.427 --> 31:14.295
you get real stupid
when you get angry.

31:14.363 --> 31:15.429
Now, give me the gun.

31:15.481 --> 31:16.815
Attaboy.

31:19.568 --> 31:21.736
Right hand
to the steering wheel.

31:22.771 --> 31:24.422
Tight.

31:28.610 --> 31:29.544
You don't mind, do you?

31:29.611 --> 31:30.628
Go ahead.
Good.

31:30.713 --> 31:31.445
Now sit tight.

31:31.497 --> 31:33.447
I'll be right back.

31:45.794 --> 31:47.795
What's wrong?

31:47.847 --> 31:48.930
We just lost the signal.

31:48.981 --> 31:50.665
Call Lori.

31:52.768 --> 31:54.269
Chin?

31:54.320 --> 31:55.987
Lori, we lost the signal;
can you resend?

31:56.071 --> 31:57.155
I lost it too; I think

31:57.239 --> 31:58.323
it's been disabled
at the source.

31:58.407 --> 31:59.440
I'll keep trying.

32:00.159 --> 32:01.475
He's off the grid.

32:01.527 --> 32:04.329
Now it's just you and me.

32:04.413 --> 32:06.197
You disabled the GPS.

32:06.282 --> 32:07.599
Now what, Rick?

32:07.666 --> 32:08.983
You know, ten years in stir,

32:09.034 --> 32:10.919
you learn to value your privacy,
you know what I'm saying?

32:10.986 --> 32:14.672
Rick... you are free.

32:14.757 --> 32:17.625
Okay? You served your time.

32:17.676 --> 32:20.328
Why are you doing this?

32:20.379 --> 32:21.512
You're gonna screw
everything up.

32:21.597 --> 32:24.265
Just give me my daughter,
and you can walk.

32:24.333 --> 32:26.000
You can walk;
you can have a life.

32:26.051 --> 32:27.018
Just give me Grace.

32:27.102 --> 32:28.353
You want me
to walk away?

32:28.437 --> 32:30.188
Just like you
walked away, right?

32:30.272 --> 32:33.174
And allowed me to rot
in that prison for a decade.

32:33.225 --> 32:36.527
You stole money, and you
stole drugs, and you got caught.

32:36.612 --> 32:37.946
You got caught, Rick.

32:38.013 --> 32:39.864
I'll tell you what...
How is any of that my fault?

32:39.949 --> 32:41.849
I'll tell you what,

32:41.901 --> 32:44.018
why don't we go visit
that judge and that jury,

32:44.069 --> 32:45.119
and we'll ask them.

32:45.187 --> 32:46.871
The ones you got to
convict my ass, remember?

32:46.956 --> 32:49.157
What did you want me to do?
I was under subpoena.

32:49.208 --> 32:50.375
I didn't have a choice, Rick!

32:50.459 --> 32:51.409
You had a choice.

32:51.493 --> 32:52.810
I was a good cop, D.

32:52.878 --> 32:55.496
You weren't a good cop, Rick;
you were a dirty cop.

32:55.547 --> 32:56.948
You betrayed me.

32:57.016 --> 33:00.635
You were my partner,
and you sold me out.

33:00.702 --> 33:02.804
I mean, you were supposed
to have my back, bro.

33:02.871 --> 33:05.223
You have my daughter.

33:05.307 --> 33:07.258
Yeah, I got your daughter.
You have my daughter.

33:07.343 --> 33:09.227
What more do you want, huh?

33:09.311 --> 33:12.546
I want my life back, Danny.

33:12.598 --> 33:15.433
I want Kim back.

33:17.736 --> 33:20.071
You know, she left me
five years ago.

33:20.155 --> 33:22.907
She found somebody else.

33:22.992 --> 33:24.692
Can't blame her, though,
you know?

33:24.743 --> 33:28.246
Can't wait forever.

33:28.330 --> 33:30.231
You know what that
feels like, don't you?

33:33.168 --> 33:36.421
And Cole...

33:36.505 --> 33:39.207
already graduated high school.

33:39.258 --> 33:42.043
But he doesn't talk
to me anymore.

33:42.094 --> 33:44.929
I'm dead to him.

33:46.465 --> 33:49.517
I really wish things
were different.

33:49.584 --> 33:52.420
I really do.

33:52.471 --> 33:54.939
So do I.

33:57.693 --> 33:59.694
Uncuff yourself.

34:05.868 --> 34:07.735
All right, drive.

34:07.786 --> 34:09.053
What are you doing?

34:09.121 --> 34:12.606
I'm making things different.

34:42.187 --> 34:43.920
Kono,

34:43.989 --> 34:45.922
I just got a
text from Danny.

34:45.991 --> 34:47.408
I thought you said he didn't
have his phone with him.

34:47.476 --> 34:48.860
He doesn't.

34:50.029 --> 34:52.679
Let me call Steve.

34:52.748 --> 34:54.081
Kono, is everything
all right?

34:54.149 --> 34:55.483
Not really.

34:55.534 --> 34:58.002
Rachel got a text originating
from Danny's cell phone.

34:58.087 --> 34:59.470
Peterson must've cloned it.

34:59.538 --> 35:00.872
Well, what'd the text say?

35:00.956 --> 35:02.106
It says, "I'm going to make

35:02.174 --> 35:04.375
Stan pay for breaking us up."

35:04.460 --> 35:05.626
Does that make any sense to you?

35:05.677 --> 35:08.529
Kono, listen to me.

35:08.597 --> 35:10.664
Have HPD locate Stan Edwards

35:10.716 --> 35:12.683
and place him in protective
custody right away.

35:12.768 --> 35:14.435
Hi, Stan Edwards please.

35:14.503 --> 35:15.636
This is Danny Williams calling.

35:15.687 --> 35:17.105
Take the phone.

35:17.172 --> 35:18.973
What the hell are you doing?
Take the phone.

35:19.024 --> 35:20.641
You're gonna tell him
you need to see him

35:20.692 --> 35:21.859
right away at
Ala Moana Park.

35:21.944 --> 35:23.511
It's right across the
street from his office.

35:23.562 --> 35:24.445
Just wait.

35:24.513 --> 35:26.180
Will you stop arguing with me

35:26.231 --> 35:28.232
and just get on the phone?

35:31.686 --> 35:33.538
Stan, listen, it's Danny.

35:33.622 --> 35:35.406
I need to speak
to you right away.

35:39.161 --> 35:41.496
Steve, Stan Edwards's secretary
said he just left the office

35:41.547 --> 35:43.864
to meet Danny across the street
at Ala Moana park.

35:43.916 --> 35:45.883
No answer on Stan's cell phone.

35:45.968 --> 35:48.236
Lori, call Kono, have
her meet us there, okay?

35:59.982 --> 36:03.751
See that lonely little
trash can there?

36:03.819 --> 36:05.169
There's a gun taped inside.

36:05.237 --> 36:08.222
You go get it, and you meet
Stan halfway up this path.

36:08.273 --> 36:10.741
Rick, please.

36:10.826 --> 36:12.360
Will you just listen to me?

36:12.411 --> 36:14.228
Just listen to me
for one second, okay?

36:14.279 --> 36:16.914
Stop whining, please.

36:16.999 --> 36:19.834
When you get out, you so
much as look back at me,

36:19.901 --> 36:21.235
you start to run away,

36:21.286 --> 36:23.087
you deviate from anything
I tell you to do,

36:23.172 --> 36:25.006
and I swear to God
your little girl dies,

36:25.073 --> 36:26.240
and it's gonna be your fault.

36:26.291 --> 36:27.708
Why are you doing this, Rick?

36:27.759 --> 36:28.843
Why are you doing this?

36:28.910 --> 36:31.012
This is about you,
and this is about me.

36:31.079 --> 36:34.081
This is not about Grace,
and this is not about Stan.

36:34.133 --> 36:35.216
Why are you doing this?
I want you

36:35.267 --> 36:37.084
to pull the trigger
when you see him; I want

36:37.136 --> 36:38.252
three shots center mass.

36:38.303 --> 36:39.971
I want him dead before
he hits the ground.

36:40.055 --> 36:41.389
I'm not gonna do it.

36:41.440 --> 36:42.940
I'm not gonna kill
an innocent guy.

36:43.025 --> 36:44.058
I'm killing Stan, Rick.

36:44.109 --> 36:44.992
Come on, this is insane.

36:45.060 --> 36:46.027
Come on, don't
tell me a little

36:46.111 --> 36:47.562
part of you doesn't
want to do this.

36:47.613 --> 36:50.014
I heard everything.

36:50.082 --> 36:53.234
You and Rachel actually had
a shot one time, didn't you?

36:53.285 --> 36:54.535
You had a little baby.

36:54.603 --> 36:56.454
Almost looked like
that baby was yours.

36:56.538 --> 36:59.740
What do you... What do you think
this is going to do, Rick?

36:59.791 --> 37:01.209
What do you think
this is gonna do?

37:01.276 --> 37:02.743
You think I'm gonna
go to prison? Huh?

37:02.794 --> 37:04.912
You think I'm gonna got to
prison for murder under duress?

37:04.963 --> 37:07.215
I don't care if
you go to prison.

37:07.282 --> 37:09.383
But I know Rachel's not
gonna forgive you for this.

37:09.451 --> 37:10.951
So you're gonna
lose the only thing

37:11.003 --> 37:12.086
that means anything to you.

37:12.137 --> 37:13.787
You're gonna lose your family.

37:13.839 --> 37:14.922
Now, I've had enough talking.

37:14.973 --> 37:16.424
Get out!
Please, just tell me...

37:16.475 --> 37:17.875
Get out of the car, D.

37:17.943 --> 37:19.960
Don't make me ask you again.

37:34.359 --> 37:36.761
Hey, Danny, what's going on?

37:37.663 --> 37:39.297
Danny?

37:39.364 --> 37:41.415
How's Grace? Is she okay?
Stop, stop.

37:42.885 --> 37:44.151
Stan, listen to me...

37:44.203 --> 37:45.586
What's going on, Danny?

37:51.126 --> 37:52.243
Get Peterson!

37:52.311 --> 37:53.827
Go, go, go! Danny!

37:53.879 --> 37:55.513
There's a man inside my car.

37:55.581 --> 37:57.331
And he's-he's
going to kill Grace...

37:58.217 --> 37:59.250
...if I don't kill you.

37:59.318 --> 38:00.518
Danny, what...

38:00.602 --> 38:01.969
I don't have a choice,
do you understand me?

38:02.020 --> 38:03.137
I don't have a choice.
This for Grace?

38:03.188 --> 38:05.306
Don't talk to him, shoot him.

38:05.374 --> 38:06.090
Danny!
I don't have a choice.

38:06.158 --> 38:07.008
I'm sorry.
Danny!

38:07.075 --> 38:08.943
I'm sorry.

38:12.898 --> 38:13.948
Danny!

38:18.870 --> 38:20.821
Good boy.

38:20.872 --> 38:21.855
Rick Peterson!

38:21.907 --> 38:24.075
Get your hands where
I can see them!

38:24.159 --> 38:25.293
Do it now!

38:28.547 --> 38:29.647
Put down your weapon!

38:30.849 --> 38:32.783
Do it now!
All right.

38:32.851 --> 38:33.884
Danny!

38:35.203 --> 38:36.721
He'll be okay.

38:36.805 --> 38:38.089
Listen, I put one
in the shoulder,

38:38.173 --> 38:39.290
the rest were in the grass.

38:39.358 --> 38:40.558
Okay?
Tell Rachel I'm sorry.

38:41.910 --> 38:44.128
I need a paramedic
here right now.

38:44.196 --> 38:46.013
Yeah, right now.

38:46.064 --> 38:48.866
You're gonna be all right.

38:48.934 --> 38:51.802
Rachel, he's been shot
in the shoulder.

38:51.870 --> 38:53.237
Keep pressure, keep
pressure right here.

38:53.322 --> 38:54.288
Okay, listen to me.

38:54.356 --> 38:55.773
Paramedics are
on their way, okay?

38:55.841 --> 38:57.642
He's gonna be okay.
You're gonna be all right, buddy.

38:57.709 --> 38:59.193
Where is she?

38:59.244 --> 39:01.312
Where is she?

39:02.881 --> 39:03.897
Oh...!

39:06.051 --> 39:07.468
Danny!

39:07.536 --> 39:09.654
Listen to me, you
son of a bitch.

39:09.721 --> 39:11.689
Next one's in your head;
now tell me

39:11.757 --> 39:12.873
where my daughter is.

39:12.924 --> 39:14.074
Huh?

39:14.126 --> 39:15.676
Huh?

39:35.831 --> 39:36.930
Grace!

39:36.982 --> 39:38.098
Daddy!

39:38.150 --> 39:40.217
Okay, baby, stay away
from the door, okay?

39:49.944 --> 39:52.279
You okay, baby?

39:52.331 --> 39:53.414
Huh?
Yeah.

39:53.465 --> 39:54.332
You hurt anywhere?

39:54.416 --> 39:56.000
Are you sure?

39:56.084 --> 39:58.235
Oh, come here.

40:00.972 --> 40:02.506
Okay.

40:02.607 --> 40:04.508
One more second, sweetheart,
we'll have you out of here.

40:04.593 --> 40:05.793
It's okay.

40:05.844 --> 40:07.728
I want to go home.
I know, baby, we're gonna

40:07.796 --> 40:09.196
go home right now, okay?

40:09.264 --> 40:11.799
Okay.

40:11.850 --> 40:14.068
We're gonna go home,
monkey, okay? Come on.

40:16.355 --> 40:18.305
I'm so sorry.

40:18.357 --> 40:21.575
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

40:30.836 --> 40:31.985
It's okay.

40:39.478 --> 40:40.828
I'm sorry.
