  I--it's, it's real important
             to me.

     You don't have a job?
            A girl?

       Ya know, she works
      all the time really.

01:15.743 --> 01:20.779

extra for the after-hour bagels?

      you just throw money

  um, someone made guacamole?

 - I think laurie is pregnant.
            - What?

06:34.561 --> 06:35.727
 - She's showing all the signs.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.596
   She's eating avocados like
         they're water,

06:37.598 --> 06:40.732
      She's puking on cue,
   her nipples have darkened

06:40.734 --> 06:42.734
     To the color of a deep
         french roast.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.603
    - You just may have just
     ruined nipples for me.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.972
         Anyway, wait--
   what about your vasectomy?

06:46.974 --> 06:49.775
The vasectomy that you badgered
         me not to get.

06:49.777 --> 06:52.677
 "oh, don't get a nut-cut, bro.
     Don't get a nut-cut."

06:52.679 --> 06:54.513
   - I don't sound like that.

06:54.515 --> 06:55.914
 - You sound exactly like that.
  - Wait, you listened to me?

06:55.916 --> 06:57.949
   - Yes, I listened to you!

06:57.951 --> 06:59.684
      - Was laurie--well,
     how did laurie react?

06:59.686 --> 07:00.819
    Was she cool with that?

07:00.821 --> 07:03.822
    - That's the tricky part
        of all of this.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.490
       She doesn't know.

07:05.492 --> 07:06.525
          I faked it.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.660
 - How do you fake a vasectomy?

07:08.662 --> 07:09.795
  - Well, that part was easy.

07:09.797 --> 07:12.063
          I came home.
           I limped.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.032
       I put frozen peas
         on my crotch.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.901
         She brought me
         pizza bagels.

07:15.903 --> 07:19.571
     I even marked my sack
       with a highlighter

07:19.573 --> 07:20.739
          Just in case
          she checked.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.841
       She did not check,
          by the way.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.743

         from new york

07:24.745 --> 07:26.912

          - Yeah, we.

07:29.450 --> 07:32.884
      - Whoa, whoa, whoa.
 There is no "we" in "laurie."

07:32.886 --> 07:35.454
       - Tallyho, chaps!

07:35.456 --> 07:37.155
        It's snack time.

07:37.157 --> 07:41.026
         I made a cabin
     out of tofu slim jims

07:41.028 --> 07:43.195
        And there's also
        chai cola here.

07:43.197 --> 07:48.133
    It tastes just like cola
except slightly more gelatinous

07:48.135 --> 07:49.734
        And a bit chewy.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.102
           - Awesome!

07:51.104 --> 07:53.738
  None of the other moms make
      such healthy snacks.

07:53.740 --> 07:54.806
        Since I met you,
      I'm really thinking

07:54.808 --> 07:58.910
           - [gasps]
 eddie, that makes me so happy.

07:58.912 --> 08:01.580
          Do you know?
I really feel a movement coming.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.582
     Now I'm just gonna be
          in the house

08:03.584 --> 08:04.783
  If you need anything at all.

08:04.785 --> 08:07.853
- I told you you were gonna make
        some great mates

08:07.855 --> 08:08.854
       In san francisco,
           didn't I?

08:08.856 --> 08:10.555
           Good job!
           Good job!

08:16.229 --> 08:19.831
- "oh, I really feel a movement
       coming, gentlemen.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.533
      Out of my butthole."

08:21.535 --> 08:23.768
         [all laughing]

08:23.770 --> 08:25.670
           - Oh, man.
         Come on, guys.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.772
        To the brigade!

08:29.775 --> 08:32.077
     Uh, where do you think
         you're going?

08:32.078 --> 08:34.279
    - I got my third stripe
           yesterday

08:34.280 --> 08:37.749
   When I used my piggy bank
       for our snack run.

08:37.751 --> 08:40.251
     - Yeah, well, you need
      to have five stripes

08:40.254 --> 08:41.753
    To get into the brigade.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.890
     - Not since we did all
        of our upgrades.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.992
   Why don't you keep watch?

08:46.994 --> 08:48.059
            - Okay.

08:52.098 --> 08:54.099
   - Make sure nobody comes.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.834
          - Hey, bud.

08:55.836 --> 08:56.968
        - Oh, hey, will.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.036
       - What's going on?

08:58.038 --> 09:00.805
         - Just hanging
         with my buds.

09:00.807 --> 09:02.874
           - Oh yeah?
   Then why are they up there

09:02.876 --> 09:04.042
     And you're down here?

09:04.044 --> 09:05.710
   - Duh, I'm standing guard.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.212
      It's very important.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.813
 - Doesn't sound all that fun.

09:08.815 --> 09:10.615
 - I love standing guard, will.

09:10.617 --> 09:12.851
   Just try and get past me.
            Try it.

09:12.853 --> 09:15.887
    What I lack in strength,
  I make up for in shrieking.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.622
           [shrieks]

09:17.624 --> 09:19.257
        - Keep it down!
              God!

09:19.259 --> 09:22.193
     - Right, sorry, eddie.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.129
   I'm sure I'll get to go up
          there later.

09:30.970 --> 09:32.837
      - We got a problem.

09:32.839 --> 09:34.639
  - What--what are you doing?

09:34.641 --> 09:36.641
  - Well, your dumbwaiter door
            is stuck

09:36.643 --> 09:39.778
   And I'm gonna loosen it up
  so that marcus can come over

09:39.780 --> 09:41.179
       Whenever he wants
     over the next few days

09:41.181 --> 09:42.647
       While I'm around.

09:42.649 --> 09:44.082
       - I thought it was
        a 36 hour trip.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.350
    - It is but some things
         have come up.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.619
         - What things?

09:47.621 --> 09:50.221
    Well, for one, marcus's
      so-called "friends"

09:50.223 --> 09:52.824
   Have turned my tree house
        into a brigade,

09:52.826 --> 09:54.225
       Which they are not
      letting him up into.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.994
He is currently standing guard.

09:55.996 --> 09:58.129
     - Everyone has to take
     a turn standing guard.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.832
    - No, no, marcus doesn't
      have to stand guard.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.701
       Do you understand?
      It's his tree house.

10:02.703 --> 10:05.770
  - Having trouble letting go
            are we?

10:05.772 --> 10:08.807
     - I am trying to keep
 your kid from getting bullied.

10:08.809 --> 10:11.009
   - Is it so hard to believe
  that a bunch of cheeky, fun

10:11.011 --> 10:12.944
      Eighth graders want
    to hang out with marcus?

10:12.946 --> 10:14.112
             - Yes.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.381
   - You're being an arsonist
          firefighter.

10:16.383 --> 10:19.618
  - Someone who starts a fire
    so they can put it out,

10:19.620 --> 10:21.753
          Be the hero,
     and get all the glory.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.355
 - Okay, that is so ridiculous.
      Why would I do that?

10:23.357 --> 10:25.724
        - I don't know.
            Hold on.

10:25.726 --> 10:28.860
   Put my psychologist hat on
         for a minute.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.362
           Oh, yeah!
Maybe you are inventing problems

10:30.364 --> 10:34.165
In san francisco to avoid bigger
     problems in new york.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.901
   - Take your psycho hat off
     because you're wrong.

10:36.903 --> 10:40.405
 - Marcus mentioned that since
    you've been in new york,

10:40.407 --> 10:42.774
The main structure of your life

10:42.776 --> 10:46.044
    Has been around bagels.

10:46.046 --> 10:49.014
       Is--is everything
      all right with sam?

10:49.016 --> 10:52.684
       - Okay, everything
       is great with sam.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.853
     I am dying to get back
  to new york to be with her.

10:54.855 --> 10:55.987
           - Are you?

10:55.989 --> 10:56.988
   - Yeah and she can't wait
           to see me.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.757
            - I bet.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.225
 - So why don't you stop trying
   to turn this around on me.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.127
   Let me tell you something.
          I know boys.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.295
 And I know those boys are not
       marcus's friends.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.064
    So I'm gonna now have to
        prove it to you

11:06.066 --> 11:07.666
 Because you don't believe me.

11:11.804 --> 11:15.040
Tell marcus the dumbwaiter door
     is open for business.

11:18.377 --> 11:21.980
    Better to be over-lubed
    than to be under-lubed.

11:23.916 --> 11:25.884
 - How do you fake a vasectomy?

11:25.886 --> 11:27.318
- Apparently, it's pretty easy.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.187
     Anyway, the point is,
      I have to be around

11:29.189 --> 11:32.323
    To help him tell laurie
  because that can go so dark.

11:32.325 --> 11:35.794
 Oh, and marcus is being taken
 advantage of by these bullies.

11:35.796 --> 11:38.296
  And fiona just won't see it
   so it's like, I can't just

11:38.298 --> 11:40.031
   Show up after three months
 and tell her what's going on.

11:40.033 --> 11:43.168
 I gotta figure a way to prove
    to her what's going on.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.469
             - Wow.

11:44.471 --> 11:45.804
            - What?

11:45.806 --> 11:49.941
     You spent three months
trying to find the perfect bagel

11:49.943 --> 11:53.011
           And you're
   in san francisco 24 hours

11:53.013 --> 11:55.413
 And you got so much going on.

11:55.415 --> 11:59.918
   Well, anyway, I just uh--
 I really--I need a couple days

11:59.920 --> 12:01.853
        To just sort of
      sort everything out.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.455
      I hope that's okay.

12:03.457 --> 12:05.890
     - Oh, baby, of course.
 Take as much time as you need.

12:05.892 --> 12:09.227
  I'm working doubles all week
            anyway.

12:09.229 --> 12:12.130
        - Great, great.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.299
      - Yeah, I gotta go.

12:14.301 --> 12:15.400
          I love you.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.802
       - I love you too.
              Bye.

12:21.240 --> 12:21.473
               .

12:21.475 --> 12:28.146
Apparently, someone is claiming
 they co-wrote <i> runaway sleigh.</i>

12:28.148 --> 12:30.315
            - What?
         That is crazy!

12:30.317 --> 12:32.283
       I wrote that song.
      Who is saying that?

12:32.285 --> 12:34.152
       - I have no idea.

12:34.154 --> 12:35.920
      But in the meantime,
   you're gonna have to make

12:35.922 --> 12:38.123
       A few adjustments
       to your lifestyle.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.058
   - I need this money, dude.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.960
 - It's not that big of a deal,
           all right?

12:41.962 --> 12:44.229
    It's not like your money
    is gone, it's just like,

12:44.231 --> 12:45.830
     The spigot is clogged.

12:45.832 --> 12:47.866
   - Well, how long to unclog
          the spigot?

12:47.868 --> 12:51.536
        - I don't know,
        weeks, months...

12:51.538 --> 12:54.906
      - Do not say years.
            - Okay.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.841
        - Surprise, huh?

12:56.843 --> 12:58.443
    Is this a good surprise
       or a bad surprise?

12:58.445 --> 13:00.111
- It could be a great surprise,
          right, will?

13:00.113 --> 13:01.946
    - We could take "great"
         off the table.

13:01.948 --> 13:05.483
      - Mom, alex hit me!
        - Did not, jerk!

13:05.485 --> 13:09.020
            - Alex!
   Stop hitting your sister!

13:09.022 --> 13:10.955
            [sighs]
      thank god we are out

13:10.957 --> 13:13.224
  Of our child-rearing years,
      ya know what I mean?

13:13.226 --> 13:15.260
     God, I can't wait till
  they're all out of the house

13:15.262 --> 13:18.830
        And it's just me
and whoever I marry after andy.

13:18.832 --> 13:21.466
           [laughter]

13:21.468 --> 13:23.101
    - She's on fire tonight.

13:23.103 --> 13:25.837
   - Ya know, I think I hear
       the baby is crying

13:25.839 --> 13:28.873
 And--why don't you tell laurie
         the surprise.

13:28.875 --> 13:31.176
            - What?
          Andy, andy!

13:31.178 --> 13:33.812
       - Well, all right,
 so what's the surprise, will?

13:38.551 --> 13:41.986
      - Let me just--uh--
      that's much better.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.157
    Here's the deal, laurie.

13:46.159 --> 13:50.829
  Uh, there is a slight chance
      that with all the--

13:50.831 --> 13:54.332
         That you are--
       how do I put this?

13:54.334 --> 13:56.968
  That you might be carrying.

13:56.970 --> 13:59.470
        - Carrying what?

13:59.472 --> 14:00.905
       - Like a--a baby.

14:00.907 --> 14:03.007
            - What?
       That's impossible.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.108
     Andy had a vasectomy.

14:04.110 --> 14:08.246
    - That is a funny story,
           actually.

14:08.248 --> 14:09.881
      [laughing nervously]

14:09.883 --> 14:10.949
    Makes me laugh to think
           about it.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.951
           [laughter]

14:12.953 --> 14:16.387
     Andy's a deep thinker
        as we all know.

14:16.389 --> 14:20.425
     And he--after careful
         consideration,

14:20.427 --> 14:25.930
        Andy decided not
      to get a vasectomy.

14:25.932 --> 14:28.399
   And I--and I may have had
        a little bit of

14:28.401 --> 14:34.305
   A little bit of um--a part
        to do with that.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.941
         - Oh, my god.

14:38.510 --> 14:40.178
          - Surprise!

14:40.180 --> 14:42.013
         - Oh, my god!

14:43.983 --> 14:45.316
          - Hurry up!

14:51.156 --> 14:53.524
            - Ready.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.894
         - Hey marcus,
        here's your tip.

14:57.296 --> 14:58.663
         - Uh, marcus,
    we saved you some pizza.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.331
            - Cool.
            - Yeah.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.967
        Oops, I'm sorry.

15:02.969 --> 15:05.370
      - I'm watching you,
       you little punks.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.906
           [sniffing]
             oh...

15:07.908 --> 15:09.908
      - One, one thousand,
       two, one thousand,

15:09.910 --> 15:11.376
      Three, one thousand,
      four, one thousand,

15:11.378 --> 15:15.680
      Five, one thousand,
   ready or not, here I come.

15:15.682 --> 15:18.082
       Hands up, marcus.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.385
     [groans and laughter]

15:20.387 --> 15:23.554
         - Hey, marcus.

15:23.556 --> 15:26.190
            - Will?

15:26.192 --> 15:28.493
  What on earth are you doing?

15:28.495 --> 15:30.128
      - I am documenting.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.030
      - No, you're spying

15:32.032 --> 15:34.198
      On four teenage boys
    out your bedroom window.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.234
     Ew, that is so pervy.

15:36.236 --> 15:39.437
- Fiona, these so-called friends
  of marcus's are evil, okay?

15:39.439 --> 15:40.438
      And you need to see
     it with your own eyes.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.506
         Get over here.

15:41.508 --> 15:42.507
             - No.
        - Get over here.

15:42.509 --> 15:43.508
        - No, I'm sorry,
            I cant.

15:43.510 --> 15:47.111
          - Hey! Hey!
  You get back here right now.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.479
      - Will, will, will!
      - You come with me.

15:48.481 --> 15:52.417
     - Hey marcus, have you
ever heard of an atomic wedgie?

15:52.419 --> 15:54.252
           - Uh, no,
  but it doesn't sound great.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.654
    - It's not supposed to.
          Turn around.

15:56.656 --> 15:57.655
            - Duck!

15:57.657 --> 15:59.357
             - Oh!

15:59.359 --> 16:00.992
            Bugger!
             Don't!

16:02.394 --> 16:04.395
      - Okay, once you see
          what I see,

16:04.397 --> 16:05.396
     Then we can figure out
          what to do--

16:05.398 --> 16:06.664
           - No, no.
         Will, listen.

16:06.666 --> 16:09.000
        There is no we,
       do you understand?

16:09.002 --> 16:09.701
           You left.

16:09.703 --> 16:13.538
       And we have spent
three months getting over that.

16:13.540 --> 16:14.973
     And now we're finally
           over that,

16:14.975 --> 16:16.441
        And you have to
        leave us alone.

16:16.443 --> 16:17.642
     - Will, what the heck!

16:17.644 --> 16:20.311
      Are you spying on...

16:20.313 --> 16:21.679
              Me?

16:21.681 --> 16:23.314
              Mom?

16:25.484 --> 16:25.717
               .

16:25.719 --> 16:28.619
  - You two were spying on me,
          weren't you?

16:28.621 --> 16:32.290
I guess birth reenactment trust
exercises mean nothing anymore.

16:32.292 --> 16:35.326
 - No, marcus, your mother was
   not spying, it was all me.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.494
        And I understand
      if you're mad at me,

16:36.496 --> 16:39.764
     But those kids are not
         your friends.

16:39.766 --> 16:42.567
  - When I get back to school
           on Monday,

16:42.569 --> 16:44.569
       I'm back to having
          no friends.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.371
      Thanks a lot, will.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.172
     Good to have you back.

16:48.174 --> 16:49.307
          - Darling...

16:51.243 --> 16:53.644
      This is a big mess!

16:56.315 --> 16:58.082
              Hey!
        - Hi, mrs. Bowa.

16:58.084 --> 16:59.717
  Those kale and ginger shots
         were amazing.

16:59.719 --> 17:03.287
     - Cut the crap, eddie.
  And lower my baby in utero!

17:03.289 --> 17:06.324
     You are mean-spirited
little buggers, the lot of you.

17:06.326 --> 17:08.192
   Get out of my tree house.

17:08.194 --> 17:11.194
            Get out!

17:11.196 --> 17:13.196
              Hey!
       Don't laugh at me!

17:13.199 --> 17:16.534
      Well, actually--uh--
   it's not your tree house.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.368
 And it's not marcus's either.

17:18.371 --> 17:22.272
 It's that weird, tall wiry guy
and he's not even around anyway.

17:22.275 --> 17:23.674
       - Oh, I'm around.

17:23.675 --> 17:26.310
       And I take offense
      to the wiry comment.

17:26.311 --> 17:28.445
         It's much more
      of a chiseled thing.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.715
 Now get out of the tree house
           right now!

17:30.717 --> 17:31.749
            Come on.

17:31.751 --> 17:34.318
            Move it!

17:34.320 --> 17:36.721
            Move it.
 Line up in front of mrs. Bowa.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.357
           I want you
      to apologize to her

17:39.359 --> 17:42.260
    For being disrespectful
         little dudes.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.062
        All: I'm sorry.

17:44.064 --> 17:47.598
       - Now, if we hear
           any of you

17:47.600 --> 17:50.068
   Who say a single bad word
         about marcus,

17:50.070 --> 17:53.271
In school, in the neighborhood,
       or anywhere else,

17:53.273 --> 17:56.140
      I will destroy you.

17:56.142 --> 17:58.209
         Are we clear?

17:58.211 --> 17:59.777
        Anything to add?

17:59.779 --> 18:02.346
 - You are all god's children.

18:02.348 --> 18:05.583
       We still have love
     in our hearts for you.

18:08.454 --> 18:10.221
          - That too.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.256
        Get out of here,
             scram.

18:12.258 --> 18:15.593
           Let's go.
            Move it.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.162
      Don't forget to put
        your helmets on.

18:18.164 --> 18:19.530
       - Thank you, will.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.432
            You were
      a little bit right.

18:21.434 --> 18:24.502
     I just so want marcus
        to have friends.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.270
      - Listen, you know,
        you were right--

18:26.272 --> 18:29.373
       A little right too
   about the new york thing.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.275
        I talked to sam
 and told her I was gonna stay

18:31.277 --> 18:35.313
     A couple of extra days
and she didn't bat an eye, so...

18:36.381 --> 18:38.883
     - You'll work it out.

18:57.402 --> 18:59.470
   - I saw that your friends
    cleaned out your supply,

18:59.472 --> 19:03.374
 So I thought the least I could
  do is replenish your stock.

19:03.376 --> 19:04.742
     You mind if I come up?

19:04.744 --> 19:06.744
         - Technically,
      it's your property.

19:11.750 --> 19:14.685
       I know those guys
   weren't my friends, will.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.687
        But I was hoping
      I could grow on them

19:16.689 --> 19:19.924
      Like I grew on you.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.425
            Thanks.

19:21.427 --> 19:24.262
       - Well, you know,

19:24.264 --> 19:27.331
        All those times
      we were facetiming,

19:27.333 --> 19:30.434
  When you were telling me how
     great everything was,

19:30.436 --> 19:32.403
 I really wish you had told me
           the truth.

19:32.405 --> 19:37.308
  I mean, if things are tough,
     marcus, I'm your guy.

19:40.245 --> 19:43.748
            Come on.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.884
 - I thought about telling you.

19:46.886 --> 19:49.620
   But I didn't want to make
         you feel bad.

19:49.622 --> 19:52.823
     You're having the time
   of your life in new york.

19:52.825 --> 19:55.459
  I wanted you to keep having
         a great time.

19:55.461 --> 19:59.430
    You are loving new york,
             right?

19:59.432 --> 20:03.701
        [phone ringing]

20:03.703 --> 20:06.671
        - Hold on a sec.

20:06.673 --> 20:07.872
     Oh, I gotta take this.
          Real quick.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.440
   I'll be right back, okay?

20:09.442 --> 20:10.775
Give me some good news, richard.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.243
       I am begging you.

20:12.245 --> 20:14.245
 - Nah, I got nothing on that,
             will.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.280
  But, I've been going through
         your finances

20:16.282 --> 20:19.317
 And I think I found a way for
 you to fix your money problems

20:19.319 --> 20:21.319
     Without you having to
     change your lifestyle.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.420
      - Okay, talk to me.

20:22.422 --> 20:23.754
        - My thought is,

20:23.756 --> 20:26.257
       You sell the place
       in san francisco.

20:26.259 --> 20:27.358
    You're not living there.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.659
    You're not even renting
         the place out.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.294
  All you have to do is sell,

20:30.296 --> 20:32.830
    And your money problems
          are solved.

20:32.832 --> 20:35.299
        Easy fix, right?

20:35.301 --> 20:38.436
            - Yeah.
          That's easy.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.507
  - May I lay my hands on you?

20:46.445 --> 20:48.346
          - I...Guess?

20:48.348 --> 20:50.548
            - Okay.

20:50.550 --> 20:56.254
    I'm just going to gently
          massage you.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.889
    Andy, would you massage
      the goddess's feet?

20:58.891 --> 21:00.725
      - I'm not permitted
     to touch the goddess--

21:00.727 --> 21:02.660
 - Andy, do as the doula says.

21:06.031 --> 21:11.402
- It would be my absolute honor
        to make you feel

21:11.404 --> 21:13.838
  Like the goddess you deserve
         to be, laurie,

21:13.840 --> 21:15.306
   Throughout your pregnancy.

21:15.308 --> 21:17.041
      And if I'm not here,

21:17.043 --> 21:19.510
     Andy will massage you,

21:19.512 --> 21:21.279
         And andy will
       take care of you,

21:21.281 --> 21:24.782
   And andy is your servant.
           - Servant?

21:24.784 --> 21:26.350
   - Andy, get the checkbook.
         Pay the doula.

21:26.352 --> 21:28.352
            [barks]
