01:53.748 --> 01:56.083
<i>By the mid-1960s,</i>

01:56.116 --> 01:58.185
<i>it looked as if
the Vietnam War</i>

01:58.218 --> 02:00.120
<i>had no end in sight.</i>

02:00.153 --> 02:02.757
<i>Our boys were coming home
in body bags</i>

02:02.790 --> 02:06.326
<i>faster than we could
send them over.</i>

02:06.360 --> 02:09.196
<i>That's when I did my part
and joined up.</i>

02:09.229 --> 02:15.068
<i>And for three years,
I nursed soldiers in Vietnam.</i>

02:15.102 --> 02:17.472
<i>But this story
isn't about me.</i>

02:17.505 --> 02:20.274
<i>This is about
the love of my life</i>

02:20.307 --> 02:23.310
<i>and the three men who
went against all the odds</i>

02:23.343 --> 02:25.813
<i>to get him back to me.</i>

02:25.847 --> 02:28.616
<i>They were known
as the Chain Breakers,</i>

02:28.650 --> 02:32.085
<i>four young lads
full of guts and swagger,</i>

02:32.119 --> 02:33.855
<i>a secret elite squad</i>

02:33.888 --> 02:38.760
<i>from the UK, the US,
and Australia.</i>

02:38.793 --> 02:40.695
<i>They've rescued hostages</i>

02:40.728 --> 02:43.163
<i>from the presidential palace
in Saigon,</i>

02:43.196 --> 02:46.734
<i>they evacuated
the US Embassy in Laos,</i>

02:46.768 --> 02:48.536
<i>and then they were
taken prisoner.</i>

02:48.570 --> 02:52.139
<i>For 12 months, they were
beaten and tortured</i>

02:52.172 --> 02:55.208
<i>by the notorious commander,
Nguyen Tan,</i>

02:55.242 --> 02:58.278
<i>until they escaped.</i>

02:58.312 --> 03:01.248
<i>But we weren't reunited
right away.</i>

03:01.281 --> 03:03.618
<i>Sometimes it takes
a long time</i>

03:03.651 --> 03:05.553
<i>to find a happy ending.</i>

03:05.587 --> 03:09.389
<i>Sometimes it takes a very,
very long time indeed.</i>

04:26.401 --> 04:30.705
Mr.. Bronson, can you show me
your teeth, please?

04:30.738 --> 04:32.305
Big smile.

04:39.414 --> 04:42.483
And can you raise both
of your arms like this?

04:42.517 --> 04:44.317
Alright.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.428
Now, Mr.. Bronson,

04:53.461 --> 04:55.630
can you repeat
this phrase after me?

04:55.663 --> 04:57.665
"Don't cry over spilt milk."

04:59.934 --> 05:00.968
D...

05:01.002 --> 05:05.606
Don't... cry...

05:05.640 --> 05:08.943
over...

05:08.976 --> 05:11.012
spilt milk.

05:11.045 --> 05:12.480
Thank you.

05:58.325 --> 05:59.827
Thank you.

06:33.895 --> 06:35.530
Norma?

06:40.902 --> 06:42.369
Norma.

06:48.876 --> 06:51.979
Norma, it's me.
It's Jack.

06:56.117 --> 06:59.787
Jackie!
It's been so long.

06:59.821 --> 07:02.824
50 years.

07:02.857 --> 07:04.357
Huh.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.029
What are you doing here?

07:08.062 --> 07:11.398
Um, there's something
I've wanted to ask you

07:11.432 --> 07:13.668
all these years.

07:13.701 --> 07:14.669
OK.

07:22.143 --> 07:24.979
Do you remember how we met?

07:25.012 --> 07:28.850
Of course. I... I was...

07:28.883 --> 07:31.384
You were standing
on the jetty.

07:31.419 --> 07:34.155
I was standing
on the jetty,

07:34.188 --> 07:35.723
and it was sunset.

07:35.756 --> 07:38.025
The day before
I shipped out.

07:38.059 --> 07:40.393
I was a nurse.

07:40.428 --> 07:44.665
And you thought you were
so handsome in that uniform.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.803
There's something I should have
asked you that day,

07:48.836 --> 07:50.838
and I didn't.

07:50.872 --> 07:55.176
And I've regretted it
every minute since.

07:55.209 --> 07:57.178
What is it?

07:57.211 --> 07:58.946
Alright, everybody,
let's go!

07:58.980 --> 08:00.414
What's going on?

08:00.448 --> 08:02.783
- We're being transferred.
- What?

08:02.817 --> 08:04.819
Come on, guys. Everybody,
please, right this way.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.787
- Hey, listen.
- Ma'am, follow me.

08:06.821 --> 08:08.856
Listen to me. Can you
just give us a minute?

08:08.890 --> 08:10.725
I'm sorry, sir.
We have to keep moving.

08:10.758 --> 08:13.794
Unless you wanna know what
it's like to dribble teeth,

08:13.828 --> 08:17.098
I strongly suggest
you remove that hand.

08:20.735 --> 08:23.104
Ben, we've got
a problem here.

08:24.739 --> 08:27.108
Oh, man.
Hold on for one second.

08:27.141 --> 08:28.743
- Hey, hey...
- Ma'am, this way, please.

08:28.776 --> 08:30.878
What are you doing?
Let go of...

08:30.912 --> 08:33.681
I said, "Let go of me."

08:33.714 --> 08:36.450
I'll find you, Norma.
I promise!

08:36.484 --> 08:37.717
Come on, follow me.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.453
I'll find you again!

08:41.087 --> 08:43.157
You've been here
less than one day,

08:43.190 --> 08:45.993
and you faked a stroke,
threatened our staff,

08:46.027 --> 08:47.828
and tried to break out.

08:47.862 --> 08:50.197
I think that's a record.

08:50.231 --> 08:55.036
There was a very special
lady friend I had to see.

08:55.069 --> 08:57.738
- Norma McCarthy.
- Yeah, that's right.

08:57.772 --> 09:00.007
Why is that?

09:00.041 --> 09:03.611
Because it's been 50 years.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.047
Norma was transferred
out of here earlier today.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.715
Uh-huh. How come?

09:07.748 --> 09:09.517
She's in the early stages
of dementia.

09:09.550 --> 09:12.553
She's participating
in an experimental trial

09:12.586 --> 09:15.122
at another facility
down at the Bay.

09:16.223 --> 09:19.493
Um... look...

09:19.527 --> 09:21.696
I apologize
for the hassle.

09:21.729 --> 09:24.665
I'll just get my things,
and I'll be outta here.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.571
Take a seat, Mr. Bronson.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.206
I'd rather stand.

09:32.239 --> 09:36.043
Take... a... seat.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.624
You won't be leaving here
anytime soon.

09:50.658 --> 09:51.892
You wanna bet?

09:51.926 --> 09:53.194
I've spoken with the doctor,

09:53.227 --> 09:54.695
who told me that last week,

09:54.729 --> 09:56.664
you started a fire
in your hotel room,

09:56.697 --> 09:58.132
trying to cook
fish fingers.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.900
It wasn't fish fingers.

09:59.934 --> 10:01.936
He believes
that you are a danger

10:01.969 --> 10:03.938
to yourself and others.

10:03.971 --> 10:09.010
Really? Well, that's just
one man's opinion, isn't it?

10:09.043 --> 10:10.745
What's this?

10:10.778 --> 10:12.613
These are your
signed admission forms.

10:12.646 --> 10:14.548
You need our approval
to leave.

10:14.582 --> 10:16.183
And I'm not giving you that.

10:16.217 --> 10:17.918
I don't give a toss
what I signed.

10:17.952 --> 10:19.620
I'm gettin' the hell
outta this dump.

10:19.653 --> 10:20.788
Mr. Bronson...

10:23.057 --> 10:25.326
Oh, you wanna dance
with me, sweetheart?

10:25.359 --> 10:27.561
Mr. Bronson!

10:29.096 --> 10:32.066
Norma will be back
in three months.

10:32.099 --> 10:37.004
In three months, she might not
even remember who I am.

10:41.108 --> 10:43.811
Damn.

10:43.844 --> 10:47.114
It's not gonna be as easy
as it was last time.

10:47.148 --> 10:48.949
And what would that be?

10:48.983 --> 10:51.352
Escaping.

10:51.385 --> 10:54.355
What makes you think
I'm escaping?

10:54.388 --> 10:57.958
You're a Chain Breaker,
aren't you?

10:57.992 --> 10:59.994
Beat it, kid.
You bother me.

11:00.027 --> 11:02.663
"Lieutenant
Jack Bronson.

11:02.696 --> 11:04.999
"Elite Special Forces
commander

11:05.032 --> 11:07.802
"from 1967 to 1971.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.837
"Made famous for leading
the daring escape

11:09.870 --> 11:13.340
"from the infamous
Ninh Hoa prison.

11:13.374 --> 11:16.177
Can sometimes...
be grumpy."

11:16.210 --> 11:19.046
Say, aren't you a little young
to be in here?

11:19.080 --> 11:21.315
My mom works here.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.084
She makes me come after school.

11:23.117 --> 11:25.286
She thinks I'll get into
trouble by myself at home.

11:25.319 --> 11:26.987
And will you?

11:27.021 --> 11:28.322
Probably.

11:32.159 --> 11:34.895
What's that?

11:34.929 --> 11:36.697
That's none
of your beeswax.

11:38.866 --> 11:43.070
So, now that you're here,
we have a full set.

11:43.104 --> 11:44.705
A full set of what?

11:44.738 --> 11:46.640
Chain Breakers.

11:46.674 --> 11:49.411
We got Jeremiah Caine,
James Wendell,

11:49.444 --> 11:52.012
Angus "Screw Loose" Wilson
and you.

11:54.048 --> 11:56.750
You're all here.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.352
Show me.

11:58.385 --> 12:03.924
I understand that
if I had this Alzheimer's

12:03.958 --> 12:08.028
or dementia-whatever,

12:08.062 --> 12:11.732
how could I remember
my mother's maiden name, eh?

12:11.765 --> 12:13.901
Mr. Wilson, I need you
to understand

12:13.934 --> 12:15.903
that this can play out
in different ways.

12:15.936 --> 12:20.975
And in 1973,
I won the Brownlow Medal.

12:21.008 --> 12:24.245
Well, there was an incident,
and I got reported,

12:24.278 --> 12:25.779
but I won!

12:25.813 --> 12:27.848
- Mr. Wilson...
- On points, yeah.

12:27.882 --> 12:30.217
And I can remember
the smell of the grass,

12:30.251 --> 12:32.853
I can remember
the cheer of the crowd,

12:32.887 --> 12:37.057
I can remember the feel
of the footy on my boot.

12:37.091 --> 12:39.160
If I had this...

12:39.193 --> 12:40.861
Alzheimer's.

12:40.895 --> 12:43.864
Yeah, whatever. If I had...

12:43.898 --> 12:45.266
How could I remember
all these things, eh?

12:45.299 --> 12:46.934
Explain that to me.

12:46.967 --> 12:50.337
What you remember
will change from day to day.

12:50.371 --> 12:52.072
Oh, bullshit.

12:52.106 --> 12:55.209
There is absolutely
nothing bloody wrong

12:55.242 --> 12:57.811
with my memory.

12:57.845 --> 13:01.048
Now, I won't have you
or any other silly bugger

13:01.081 --> 13:02.716
telling me otherwise.

13:09.491 --> 13:11.225
Bronson?

13:14.361 --> 13:16.297
Haven't you forgotten
something there, mate?

13:21.168 --> 13:23.137
Hup, ha, hup, ha.
Get back! Back!

13:23.170 --> 13:25.105
Ha! No, no. Ha, ha!

13:29.877 --> 13:32.046
What the hell
happened to him?

13:32.079 --> 13:34.848
Ah, he fell off a roof

13:34.882 --> 13:37.485
after starting a riot in jail

13:37.519 --> 13:39.421
to cover an escape.

13:39.454 --> 13:41.121
What was he in jail for?

13:41.155 --> 13:43.123
- Robbing a bank.
- Oh.

13:43.157 --> 13:45.926
Nine banks, actually.

13:45.960 --> 13:48.162
After 50 years in the can,
d'you think I'd let a pack

13:48.195 --> 13:50.432
of big girls' blouses
like you get near me, eh?

13:50.465 --> 13:52.199
It'll be over in a minute,
I promise.

13:52.233 --> 13:53.300
No!

13:53.334 --> 13:55.836
- Prostate exam.
- Oh, ow.

14:01.342 --> 14:04.278
Grab the broom!

14:04.311 --> 14:06.481
Calm down, sir.
Calm down.

14:22.530 --> 14:25.266
What the hell
are you doing here?

14:25.299 --> 14:27.201
Well, it's my room, mate.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.369
What?

14:28.403 --> 14:29.937
- It is?
- Yeah.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.573
I mean, don't worry
about it, Howard.

14:31.606 --> 14:33.374
They all look the same,
don't they?

14:33.408 --> 14:34.942
- Uh...
- Yeah.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.011
Oh. Oh.

14:37.044 --> 14:39.213
Come on. You must have
come in the wrong door.

14:39.246 --> 14:43.017
Oh. You won't tell Maisie
about this, will you?

14:43.050 --> 14:44.251
Nah, not a word,
not a word.

14:44.285 --> 14:46.120
Oh, thanks, pal.

14:48.122 --> 14:50.190
I could have sworn...

14:52.494 --> 14:54.328
Which one is it then?

14:56.330 --> 14:57.599
Is it down here?

14:57.632 --> 15:01.235
He's gone.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.538
You're outrageous.

15:05.607 --> 15:07.841
What are you doing
in a place like this?

15:07.875 --> 15:11.211
Oh, bad luck, sweetheart.
Bad luck.

15:11.245 --> 15:13.247
You got sick, didn't you?

15:13.280 --> 15:14.982
Yeah.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.383
But I'll bounce back.

15:16.418 --> 15:18.919
Well, you'd better
hurry up.

15:18.952 --> 15:21.556
That husband of mine
will be back soon.

15:37.439 --> 15:39.306
You're probably
all wondering why

15:39.340 --> 15:43.445
I just showed up
after all these years.

15:43.478 --> 15:46.146
Yeah, well, we were
all wondering that.

15:46.180 --> 15:47.915
Well, I wasn't.

15:47.948 --> 15:51.285
50 years ago,
the four of us made a pact.

15:51.318 --> 15:53.153
- We did?
- Uh-huh.

15:53.187 --> 15:55.089
And now's the time
to make good on it.

15:55.122 --> 15:57.459
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

15:57.492 --> 15:59.461
What pact?

15:59.494 --> 16:01.563
The pact to kill Nguyen Tan.

16:01.596 --> 16:03.964
The lady in 2B?

16:03.997 --> 16:07.968
No, that's Susan Land.

16:08.001 --> 16:10.337
So... So who's this Nguyen Tan?

16:10.371 --> 16:12.607
Christ almighty, Angus!

16:12.640 --> 16:14.375
Don't you remember
that shithouse holiday

16:14.409 --> 16:16.310
we had in Vietnam?

16:16.343 --> 16:19.681
Remember that asshole
who tortured us for a year?

16:19.714 --> 16:21.949
Ohh!

16:21.982 --> 16:24.452
Silly bastard forgot
who I was last week.

16:24.486 --> 16:26.920
Do you know how many people
there are here

16:26.954 --> 16:28.590
in wheelchairs, Wendell?

16:28.623 --> 16:30.458
So we all look
the same now, do we?

16:30.492 --> 16:33.026
Hey, hey, ladies,
do you mind?

16:36.964 --> 16:40.000
So where is this bastard?

16:40.033 --> 16:44.238
He's in a nursing home
out at the Bay.

16:44.271 --> 16:47.307
Look, fellas, I'd do it myself
if I could,

16:47.341 --> 16:50.344
but I need your help
to get out of here.

16:50.377 --> 16:53.080
This will be
our last mission.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.315
We're not the
Chain Breakers anymore.

16:55.349 --> 16:57.719
What are you talking about?

16:57.752 --> 16:59.286
We'll always be
the Chain Breakers.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.989
Now we're just
a bunch of old guys

17:02.022 --> 17:04.626
who get up four times
a night to take a piss.

17:04.659 --> 17:07.027
Really?

17:07.060 --> 17:09.029
Who's the best faceman
you've ever seen?

17:09.061 --> 17:14.201
Who convinced Charlie
that Angus here was VC?

17:14.233 --> 17:17.371
Who's the toughest son of
a bitch you've ever known,

17:17.405 --> 17:19.339
the guy who took
seven bullets

17:19.373 --> 17:21.675
and still flew us
out of Laos?

17:21.709 --> 17:26.346
And there's nothing that Angus
can't fix, drive or destroy.

17:26.380 --> 17:29.617
We clawed our way out of
the deepest, darkest shithole

17:29.651 --> 17:31.753
that Nam could throw us in.

17:31.786 --> 17:34.622
And I, for one,
am not gonna let old age

17:34.656 --> 17:38.760
and this pissant nursing home
stand in my way.

17:38.793 --> 17:41.395
So how about it?
You guys with me or no?

17:41.429 --> 17:46.166
Last week Angus got trapped
in a toilet cubicle.

17:48.335 --> 17:51.004
True story.

17:51.038 --> 17:54.542
What happened to
"No excuses, no regrets"?

17:54.576 --> 17:56.511
We're not those blokes anymore!

18:00.415 --> 18:02.584
Sorry, mate.

18:02.617 --> 18:04.284
Wednesdays,
they have pudding.

18:04.318 --> 18:05.653
Pudding.

18:05.687 --> 18:09.724
You'll see.
It's not so bad here.

18:18.332 --> 18:20.167
<i>"Dear Jackie,</i>

18:20.200 --> 18:23.103
<i>"it was wonderful
to receive your letter,</i>

18:23.136 --> 18:26.541
<i>"the best and greatest
surprise of my life.</i>

18:26.574 --> 18:29.209
<i>"The Army told me that
you were missing in action,</i>

18:29.243 --> 18:31.111
<i>"presumed dead.</i>

18:31.144 --> 18:34.181
<i>"At the heart of all great love
is a great friendship.</i>

18:34.214 --> 18:36.083
<i>"And it is there
that I hope</i>

18:36.116 --> 18:38.118
<i>"we can renew and continue.</i>

18:38.151 --> 18:41.589
<i>"I cannot and will not
lose you twice."</i>

18:44.091 --> 18:46.093
<i>"My dear son, Bruce,</i>

18:46.126 --> 18:48.429
<i>"I hope this letter
finds you well.</i>

18:48.463 --> 18:50.665
<i>"I know I've done things
that are not good,</i>

18:50.698 --> 18:54.067
<i>"but I have done
good things too.</i>

18:54.101 --> 18:55.637
<i>"And the best thing
I ever did by far</i>

18:55.670 --> 18:57.438
<i>"was having you.</i>

18:57.472 --> 18:59.440
<i>"I know that you
don't want to see me,</i>

18:59.474 --> 19:01.341
<i>"and I don't blame you
for that.</i>

19:01.375 --> 19:02.710
<i>"I'm not proud of the..."</i>

19:02.744 --> 19:08.282
In 1973,
I won the Brownlow Medal.

19:09.484 --> 19:13.220
I played...

19:13.253 --> 19:17.458
I played 112 games
for the mighty Magpies.

19:17.492 --> 19:19.293
And I won...

19:19.326 --> 19:22.864
I played 112 games
for the mighty Magpies.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.435
I won the Brownlow Medal.

20:20.955 --> 20:24.826
I've spent my entire life
trying to forget that war.

20:24.859 --> 20:27.160
Do you have a plan?

20:27.194 --> 20:29.464
Does the Pope
shit in the woods?

20:31.198 --> 20:33.835
I vote
Angus doesn't come.

20:33.868 --> 20:36.203
And who the hell's this?

20:36.236 --> 20:37.672
I'm a Chain Breaker.

20:37.705 --> 20:39.540
No. He... He's not.

20:39.574 --> 20:42.543
You're a trainee,
you got it? A trainee.

20:42.577 --> 20:44.779
- We've got a trainee.
- Who?

20:44.812 --> 20:46.581
Angus.

20:46.614 --> 20:48.181
Oh, piss off.

20:48.215 --> 20:50.551
I know every single
back door, loose window

20:50.585 --> 20:52.420
and weak spot
in this place.

20:52.453 --> 20:53.888
Do you wanna
get out of here?

20:53.921 --> 20:56.189
Or do you wanna get caught
getting out of here?

20:56.223 --> 20:58.191
Sounds like
a Chain Breaker to me.

20:58.225 --> 21:00.260
Yeah. Me too.

21:00.293 --> 21:01.863
Great.
I call this mission...

21:01.896 --> 21:04.732
wait for it...

21:04.766 --> 21:06.199
Operation Skippy.

21:06.233 --> 21:08.503
Operation Skippy.

21:10.605 --> 21:11.939
We need to recon the area.

21:11.973 --> 21:14.575
I wanna know how many
guards there are.

21:14.609 --> 21:17.879
I wanna know who turns up
to work early, who's lazy,

21:17.912 --> 21:19.714
and who has
the keys to the kingdom.

21:19.747 --> 21:21.616
Maybe this'll help.

21:21.649 --> 21:23.818
Where'd you get that thing?

21:23.851 --> 21:25.586
Smuggled it in.

21:25.620 --> 21:28.423
You're not allowed
to smuggle things in.

21:28.456 --> 21:31.358
That's why they
call it "smuggling."

21:31.391 --> 21:33.594
Um... it's... it's
not loaded, is it?

21:33.628 --> 21:36.531
I thought we could frighten
a few people with it.

21:36.564 --> 21:38.599
Who'd be frightened of
a senior citizen with a gun?

21:38.633 --> 21:40.535
I don't want any civilians
harmed on this mission.

21:56.784 --> 21:58.920
Is it this room?

22:06.060 --> 22:09.731
Kitchen, bathroom.
You, nurses' station. Go.

22:35.490 --> 22:38.960
Think they'll find the guys
who fired that gun?

22:52.106 --> 22:55.710
Norma, there's
a phone call for you.

22:55.743 --> 22:57.912
Oh. Thank you.

23:01.949 --> 23:03.551
Is that you?

23:03.584 --> 23:06.386
<i>Hey, sweetheart.</i>

23:06.420 --> 23:08.055
<i>How're you doing?</i>

23:08.089 --> 23:10.691
Oh, I'm doing...

23:10.725 --> 23:12.660
I'm not doing so well.

23:14.428 --> 23:16.764
I bet you're doing better
than you think.

23:18.733 --> 23:20.701
There's this book,

23:20.735 --> 23:24.038
I know I've been
reading it all evening,

23:24.071 --> 23:26.373
but... for the life of me,

23:26.407 --> 23:28.543
I couldn't tell you
what it's about.

23:30.878 --> 23:32.747
Do you have the book
with you now?

23:32.780 --> 23:34.715
Oh.

23:34.749 --> 23:35.783
Yes.

23:35.817 --> 23:39.120
Read some of it to me.

23:39.153 --> 23:41.122
I'll remember
for the two of us.

23:46.961 --> 23:48.663
Um...

23:48.696 --> 23:51.465
"I'm not sentimental.

23:51.499 --> 23:54.735
"I'm as romantic as you are.

23:54.769 --> 23:56.971
"The idea, you know,

23:57.004 --> 24:02.143
<i>"is that the sentimental person
thinks things will last.</i>

24:02.176 --> 24:04.879
<i>"The romantic person
has a desperate confidence</i>

24:04.912 --> 24:07.782
<i>that they won't."</i>

24:11.152 --> 24:12.486
Yeah.

24:17.625 --> 24:20.127
This door, that door
and this door

24:20.161 --> 24:22.563
need key passes
to get through,

24:22.597 --> 24:24.765
but the rest are wide open.

24:24.799 --> 24:27.802
- Good job, kid. Good job.
- Yeah, well done.

24:27.835 --> 24:29.036
She's coming.

24:29.070 --> 24:30.171
Who, Lin?

24:30.204 --> 24:31.839
- No.
- Who?

24:31.873 --> 24:34.942
- Mom.
- Be cool, just be cool.

24:37.812 --> 24:41.415
Hey. What's goin' on?

24:41.449 --> 24:43.918
Nothing. Just being cool.

24:43.951 --> 24:46.120
OK...

24:46.153 --> 24:48.422
Well, if you can take
a minute from being cool,

24:48.456 --> 24:50.892
how about you go get your stuff,
so we can get going?

24:58.165 --> 25:00.801
Are you guys
the Chain Breakers?

25:00.835 --> 25:02.570
Yeah.

25:02.603 --> 25:04.772
Elliot can't stop talking
about you and your gang.

25:04.805 --> 25:07.074
Well, we like
having him around.

25:07.108 --> 25:09.844
You know, ma'am,
he may just surprise you.

25:09.877 --> 25:13.514
He may be old enough to take
care of himself after school,

25:13.547 --> 25:15.883
instead of hanging around here
with a bunch of old farts...

25:15.917 --> 25:18.486
- Uh, folks.
- Is that what he told you,

25:18.519 --> 25:19.887
that I won't let him
stay home by himself?

25:19.921 --> 25:21.889
- Uh-huh.
- He's such a shit.

25:21.923 --> 25:25.526
I would love it if he stayed
at home by himself.

25:25.559 --> 25:27.862
His father left us.

25:27.895 --> 25:31.032
Well, me.
Two months ago.

25:31.065 --> 25:33.200
- He's scared of being alone.
- Really?

25:33.234 --> 25:35.569
- He doesn't look like...
- He pretends.

25:35.603 --> 25:37.905
You guys are
the only friends he has.

25:40.174 --> 25:42.843
- Thank you, Mr. Bronson.
- Ma'am.

25:42.877 --> 25:44.845
- Mr. Caine.
- Pleasure.

25:44.879 --> 25:48.616
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah, tomorrow.

25:50.885 --> 25:52.753
Hear that?

25:54.522 --> 25:55.690
She's single.

26:04.065 --> 26:05.666
Without that keypass,

26:05.700 --> 26:08.102
we'll never set foot
outside these walls.

26:12.306 --> 26:14.809
- Hello, love.
- Kitchen's closed.

26:14.842 --> 26:16.711
Ah, yeah, I know,
but Angus and I, we missed...

26:16.744 --> 26:19.513
Kitchen's closed.

26:19.547 --> 26:21.949
Get the hell outta here!

26:25.820 --> 26:27.288
I guess she's more
of a dog person.

26:27.321 --> 26:28.956
I think.

26:45.639 --> 26:47.041
I'll take Wendell.

26:51.946 --> 26:54.248
Knock three times
if someone comes.

27:01.722 --> 27:04.091
OK, toss the joint.

27:04.125 --> 27:05.860
Keypass.

27:05.893 --> 27:07.995
Where would she put
her keypass?

27:17.371 --> 27:20.007
- Nothing in here.
- Nothing here either.

27:20.041 --> 27:21.776
Bingo.

27:21.809 --> 27:24.612
Attaboy. Now let's get
the hell outta here.

27:26.614 --> 27:29.083
Damn! It must
have snuck in.

27:29.116 --> 27:30.818
I'll get him.

27:30.851 --> 27:32.653
I'm not going down
for a cat.

27:32.686 --> 27:35.022
He won't get
out of here on his own.

27:35.056 --> 27:36.891
You saw what she was like.

27:36.924 --> 27:38.059
Got him!

27:38.092 --> 27:40.828
Hide!

27:40.861 --> 27:43.230
We've got to find
somewhere to hide.

27:46.267 --> 27:47.968
You having a senior moment
or something?

27:48.002 --> 27:50.071
I've had enough of you
abusing me, Wendell.

27:50.104 --> 27:51.739
Nah, I was just wondering,

27:51.772 --> 27:56.243
what was that tasty dish
you made for us last night?

27:56.277 --> 27:58.012
Rissoles?

27:58.045 --> 28:01.348
Bloody lovely they were,
honestly.

28:01.382 --> 28:03.250
Oh.

28:03.284 --> 28:05.052
The key
to a good rissole

28:05.086 --> 28:06.787
is using the right mince.

28:06.821 --> 28:10.057
Fabulous. Absolutely fabulous.

28:10.091 --> 28:11.659
Oh!

28:11.692 --> 28:13.327
- What about us?
- Where's the cake?

28:13.360 --> 28:14.795
We're about to sing "Happy
Birthday" to the Thompsons.

28:14.829 --> 28:16.330
Oh, I was just...

28:16.363 --> 28:17.998
Yeah, we were talking
about rissoles.

28:18.032 --> 28:19.300
- Rissoles?
- Rissoles.

28:19.333 --> 28:21.403
- You can do it!
- Oi, bloody hell!

28:21.436 --> 28:22.970
The secret of
a good rissole is...

28:25.806 --> 28:28.075
I don't even know
what to say.

28:28.109 --> 28:30.077
- We're in love.
- What?

28:30.111 --> 28:32.947
Um, you can't stand
in the way of our love.

28:32.980 --> 28:35.249
Tell them, Bronson.
What we have is very special.

28:35.282 --> 28:36.951
- Uhh...
- Is this true?

28:36.984 --> 28:39.653
Uh, yes.

28:39.687 --> 28:41.322
Very special.

28:41.355 --> 28:43.757
Get it off! It itches!

28:46.894 --> 28:49.897
- Mr. Caine!
- Mr. Caine?

28:51.065 --> 28:52.366
Mm, yeah.

28:52.399 --> 28:56.337
I'm sorry
it's not better news.

28:56.370 --> 28:58.272
Yeah.

28:58.305 --> 29:00.341
Um...

29:00.374 --> 29:04.311
Well, look,
how long have I got?

29:07.014 --> 29:10.151
Couple of months,
give or take.

29:11.986 --> 29:14.088
How much more give
than take?

29:16.357 --> 29:17.892
Not much.

29:23.264 --> 29:24.432
Bollocks.

30:30.164 --> 30:32.132
Having trouble sleeping
again, Howard?

30:32.166 --> 30:34.802
Oh, I didn't want
to keep Maisie up.

30:38.372 --> 30:40.241
I'll walk with you.

30:40.274 --> 30:41.942
Oh, that's nice.

30:49.316 --> 30:51.919
Were you
in the war, dear?

30:51.952 --> 30:55.457
No. I'm too young.

30:55.490 --> 30:58.460
My dad was.

30:58.493 --> 31:01.161
Did he make it?

31:03.230 --> 31:05.165
Does anybody ever
really make it?

31:15.843 --> 31:17.512
Norma, what's wrong?

31:22.216 --> 31:24.419
I don't know.

32:27.281 --> 32:29.249
Nice hat. You on a case?

32:29.283 --> 32:31.553
Nice slippers.
They come in men's sizes?

32:31.586 --> 32:33.053
What? They're unisex.

32:33.087 --> 32:36.023
Oh, whoa-whoa!
Steady on. I got ya.

32:36.056 --> 32:39.059
We gotta do this
together, OK?

32:39.093 --> 32:40.361
Yeah, OK.

32:43.931 --> 32:45.165
I just hope no one sees us.

32:45.199 --> 32:48.369
I hope no one sees
those slippers.

32:48.403 --> 32:50.371
Kevin O'Neill.

32:51.473 --> 32:54.241
Kevin.

32:57.144 --> 32:59.581
Geraldine Wright.

32:59.614 --> 33:01.982
Here you are, sweetie.
No worries.

33:04.385 --> 33:06.053
Er, James Wendell.

33:08.389 --> 33:10.924
Return to sender,
return to sender,

33:10.958 --> 33:12.527
return to sender.

33:22.136 --> 33:24.304
Remember those stories
you used to tell us

33:24.338 --> 33:26.006
in the cells late at night?

33:26.039 --> 33:28.643
They were just old movies
you'd never seen.

33:28.676 --> 33:30.445
Yeah, but you'd change them.

33:30.478 --> 33:32.514
You made all the endings
happy endings.

33:32.547 --> 33:34.248
You know,
for 40 years,

33:34.281 --> 33:38.185
I thought Rick got on that plane
with Ilsa.

33:38.218 --> 33:41.589
- Happy endings are better.
- Yeah!

33:41.623 --> 33:44.559
I never got a happy ending.

33:44.592 --> 33:46.994
You know, the last time
I saw my boy,

33:47.027 --> 33:49.697
I could hold him
in my hands.

33:49.731 --> 33:52.567
Now he's got children
of his own.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.702
Wendell...

33:54.736 --> 33:57.337
..did you ever think,

33:57.371 --> 33:59.741
when you were robbing all
those banks in your heyday,

33:59.774 --> 34:03.411
did you ever think that
that had something to do with

34:03.445 --> 34:06.748
the situation you currently
find yourself in now?

34:06.781 --> 34:09.382
No, Angus, I've never
thought of that.

34:10.752 --> 34:13.521
Just once... once...

34:13.554 --> 34:16.056
I wish I could take my boy
to the footy,

34:16.089 --> 34:19.694
like I should've
when he was a kid.

34:19.726 --> 34:22.129
I don't wanna
die in here.

34:22.161 --> 34:25.998
I wanna be on Daphne

34:26.033 --> 34:28.202
and forget about
everything else.

34:28.235 --> 34:32.172
Sounds like a lovely lady,
this Daphne.

34:32.206 --> 34:34.576
Oh, she is.

34:34.609 --> 34:36.310
28-foot sloop.

34:36.342 --> 34:39.681
You know, all the years
I've been in Australia,

34:39.714 --> 34:41.716
I've wanted to sail,
you know, sail properly,

34:41.748 --> 34:46.754
and, well, when I retired,
I bought Daphne.

34:46.788 --> 34:48.523
I've only sailed her once,

34:48.556 --> 34:51.391
then my doctor recommended
that I come in here

34:51.426 --> 34:55.530
for treatment
and observation.

34:55.563 --> 34:58.131
Now they say I'm too...

34:58.165 --> 35:00.300
Not well enough to leave.

35:00.334 --> 35:02.770
I should've got on that boat,
aimed at the horizon,

35:02.804 --> 35:05.707
and never seen
anybody ever again.

35:07.274 --> 35:10.143
Don't we deserve
a happy ending, Bronson?

35:10.177 --> 35:13.681
Yeah, we all deserve
happy endings.

35:15.349 --> 35:18.218
Maybe we should forget
about the escape, then.

35:19.587 --> 35:20.822
Pussies!

35:20.855 --> 35:23.424
Pack of gutless pussies.

35:23.458 --> 35:26.093
Who the hell are you?!

35:26.126 --> 35:30.698
I'm the only one
to break out of this hellhole

35:30.732 --> 35:32.065
and get away with it.

35:32.099 --> 35:34.234
You broke back in
to tell us that?

35:34.268 --> 35:35.703
Oh, shut up,
you legless pussy.

35:35.737 --> 35:38.439
- Jesus!
- I know who you are.

35:38.473 --> 35:41.141
And who's that, sunshine?

35:41.174 --> 35:42.844
You're Henry Miles,
am I right?

35:42.877 --> 35:45.078
You were in
the Great Escape.

35:45.112 --> 35:47.281
Ohh, Steve McQueen.

35:47.314 --> 35:48.850
I love Steve McQueen.
What's he like?

35:48.883 --> 35:52.554
- Angus, the real Great Escape.
- Idiot.

35:52.587 --> 35:54.221
You were one of the few
that got away.

35:54.254 --> 35:55.690
Too right I was.

35:55.723 --> 35:57.625
Well, you don't
look like much now.

35:57.659 --> 36:01.829
Maybe I'd look better
with my foot up your ass.

36:01.863 --> 36:03.831
You're gonna quit?

36:03.865 --> 36:07.167
You gotta get
your balls, fellas.

36:07.200 --> 36:10.672
You gotta... You gotta stick
to the plan with balls,

36:10.705 --> 36:12.674
and you gotta
write the plan down,

36:12.707 --> 36:15.309
and you gotta... you...

36:15.342 --> 36:17.412
and you gotta
read the plan,

36:17.445 --> 36:22.215
and you gotta read
the plan to each other,

36:22.249 --> 36:23.818
and you gotta read the plan
before you go to bed,

36:23.851 --> 36:25.587
a-a-and you gotta...

36:25.620 --> 36:27.622
you gotta brush your teeth
before you go to bed,

36:27.655 --> 36:30.491
and you gotta set your alarm

36:30.525 --> 36:34.328
so you don't sleep in and...
and miss breakfast

36:34.361 --> 36:37.197
'cause breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

36:37.230 --> 36:39.567
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we get the picture.

36:39.601 --> 36:41.301
I suppose that means
you wanna come with us.

36:41.335 --> 36:43.504
Hell no, dickhead.

36:43.538 --> 36:46.841
I'm too old for this shit.

36:48.175 --> 36:49.544
Too old for breathing!

36:49.577 --> 36:53.815
You just watch
your mouth, sunshine.

36:59.554 --> 37:01.656
He's right, you know.

37:01.689 --> 37:04.592
We're the goddamn
Chain Breakers.

37:04.626 --> 37:07.528
We don't sit around
feeling sorry for ourselves.

37:07.562 --> 37:09.664
We get the job done.

37:09.697 --> 37:11.532
I want everyone
in the storeroom.

37:11.566 --> 37:15.302
Tomorrow, 1830 hours.

37:15.335 --> 37:18.338
We're gonna finish
this damn mission.

37:48.770 --> 37:50.370
Ah.

37:53.675 --> 37:55.843
What were you doing
in there?

37:55.877 --> 37:57.879
Uh, I was just
checking on Bronson.

37:57.912 --> 38:01.281
He wasn't feeling
very well.

38:01.314 --> 38:03.785
- Is he alright now?
- Yeah.

38:03.818 --> 38:06.319
Good.

38:06.353 --> 38:07.588
Elliot!

38:07.622 --> 38:09.424
The book.

38:12.860 --> 38:14.327
Thank you.

38:22.737 --> 38:23.705
Hmm.

38:40.621 --> 38:41.989
Angus, where are you?

38:44.058 --> 38:45.760
In the foyer,

38:45.793 --> 38:48.629
with a code to the front door,
ready to punch it in.

38:48.663 --> 38:50.397
Wendell?

38:50.431 --> 38:51.766
Watching Angus's back

38:51.799 --> 38:53.835
in case some bastard
tries to stop him.

38:53.868 --> 38:55.368
Check.

38:55.403 --> 38:56.437
Caine.

38:57.905 --> 38:59.640
Caine?

38:59.674 --> 39:02.275
Oh, I know what I'm doing.

39:02.309 --> 39:03.778
Right.

39:03.811 --> 39:06.379
Once we're on the outside,
fresh air in our lungs,

39:06.414 --> 39:07.949
that's when we commandeer
a vehicle.

39:07.982 --> 39:09.684
Angus, you're driving.

39:09.717 --> 39:13.488
I haven't driven since
the year 2000.

39:13.521 --> 39:16.624
Probably would've kept that to
myself, if I were you, Angus.

39:16.657 --> 39:19.026
Well, I'd say
it's like riding a bike.

39:19.060 --> 39:20.428
Sure.

39:20.461 --> 39:23.296
Maybe we can
commandeer a bike, then.

39:23.330 --> 39:25.800
We won't all fit
on a bike, Wendell.

39:25.833 --> 39:29.003
Once we get there, we hightail
it over to the nursing home,

39:29.036 --> 39:31.672
pretend we're just visiting
a bunch of old friends,

39:31.706 --> 39:36.711
and bada-bing, bada-boom,
we're in like Flynn.

39:36.744 --> 39:40.414
- And then what?
- And then what?

39:40.448 --> 39:42.950
Then we're in, that's what.

39:42.984 --> 39:45.820
And we kill Nguyen Tan, yeah?

39:45.853 --> 39:47.889
- Yeah.
- You know where he is?

39:47.922 --> 39:50.825
'Course I do.
He's in the nursing home.

39:50.858 --> 39:53.694
Wait, hold on.

39:53.728 --> 39:57.732
How did you find out
Tan was even in the Bay?

39:57.765 --> 40:01.836
Because Nguyen Tan
isn't in the Bay.

40:01.869 --> 40:04.939
He died in 1996.

40:04.972 --> 40:06.808
Did you lie to us?

40:06.841 --> 40:08.810
- Yeah.
- Son of a bitch.

40:08.843 --> 40:10.044
I had a good reason.

40:10.077 --> 40:11.612
Who gives a shit
about your reason?

40:11.646 --> 40:13.481
Yeah, nothing's changed,
has it?

40:13.514 --> 40:15.883
It's all about Jack Bronson
and to hell with the rest of us.

40:15.917 --> 40:17.518
Come on, don't give me
that crap.

40:17.552 --> 40:19.352
Just like Laos
all over again.

40:19.386 --> 40:21.455
What are you talking about?

40:21.489 --> 40:23.356
Where the hell
would you be without me?

40:23.390 --> 40:26.460
Huh? Where would
any of you be?

40:26.494 --> 40:27.695
I put this team together,

40:27.728 --> 40:29.730
I planned out every mission.

40:29.764 --> 40:31.699
Oh, well, cheers for that.

40:31.732 --> 40:33.734
You turned
my seven-week secondment

40:33.768 --> 40:35.102
into four years of hell!

40:35.136 --> 40:36.737
Oh, horseshit.

40:36.771 --> 40:39.874
I took all you guys
from rags to ribbons.

40:39.907 --> 40:42.375
Hell, I am
the Chain Breakers.

40:42.410 --> 40:43.811
Without me,
you're all nothing.

40:43.845 --> 40:45.046
What?!

40:45.079 --> 40:47.748
- That's not true.
- Really?

40:47.782 --> 40:51.085
What have you all done
in the last 50 years, huh?

40:51.118 --> 40:53.421
I'll tell you. Nada.

40:53.454 --> 40:55.923
- That's not true!
- OK.

40:55.957 --> 40:58.059
Tell me one thing you've done.
Go ahead.

40:58.092 --> 40:59.994
I've done lots of things.

41:00.027 --> 41:01.896
We all have.

41:01.929 --> 41:04.131
Only you weren't there
to see them.

41:04.165 --> 41:05.800
He's right.

41:08.102 --> 41:12.006
You and your breakout...

41:12.039 --> 41:14.408
can go fuck yourself.

41:25.453 --> 41:28.055
<i>Is that you, Jackie?</i>

41:28.089 --> 41:29.790
Hi, sweetheart.

41:29.824 --> 41:34.028
Hope you're not causing
too much trouble over there.

41:34.061 --> 41:36.430
That doesn't sound like
something I would do, does it?

41:36.464 --> 41:39.033
<i>Oh, no, not my Jack.</i>

41:41.035 --> 41:42.470
Tell me how we met.

41:44.205 --> 41:47.008
Why do you want to hear
that old story again for?

41:48.609 --> 41:50.845
'Cause it pleases me.

41:52.580 --> 41:56.951
<i>Well, I was standing
on the jetty.</i>

41:56.984 --> 41:58.920
<i>I was a nurse,
you were a soldier.</i>

41:58.953 --> 42:03.691
It was the night before you were
shipped off to Vietnam.

42:03.724 --> 42:08.763
And you thought you looked
so handsome in your uniform.

42:10.131 --> 42:12.700
And if you'd asked me
to marry you

42:12.733 --> 42:14.502
right then, at that moment,

42:14.535 --> 42:16.070
I would have said yes.

44:11.986 --> 44:15.256
Shit-for-brains,
come with me.

44:22.363 --> 44:24.365
Who the hell is this?

44:24.398 --> 44:27.001
This is Rob "The Rabbit" Mason.

44:27.034 --> 44:29.070
He escaped this place
seven times.

44:29.103 --> 44:30.905
That's a record here,
you know.

44:30.938 --> 44:33.674
Lin beefed up the security,
but the Rabbit was persistent,

44:33.707 --> 44:36.110
always found a way.

44:36.143 --> 44:39.947
Oh, a bloody menace he was.

44:39.980 --> 44:44.852
Last time he escaped,
the Rabbit stole a car.

44:44.885 --> 44:46.353
Really?

44:46.387 --> 44:50.591
So Lin keeps him sedated.

44:53.260 --> 44:55.196
You mark my words.

44:55.229 --> 44:58.766
The next time you escape,
you better bloody escape.

45:02.203 --> 45:04.672
Howard, don't forget your file.

45:04.705 --> 45:06.107
Oh, thank you.

45:19.687 --> 45:22.223
You waiting to go
to the hospital too?

45:22.256 --> 45:23.958
No, I'm just waiting.

45:23.991 --> 45:26.794
Ah. Aren't we all?

45:28.295 --> 45:30.965
Howard Leonard,
3rd Battalion.

45:30.998 --> 45:33.367
Jack Bronson,
Shadow Company.

45:33.401 --> 45:37.037
- Oh. Special Forces?
- Yeah.

45:38.839 --> 45:43.811
Um, listen, pal,
I gotta hit the head again.

45:43.844 --> 45:47.248
Um, if these jokers from
the hospital ever turn up,

45:47.281 --> 45:49.150
tell them to wait for me,
will you?

45:49.183 --> 45:51.852
- No worries.
- Oh, thanks, pal.

45:51.886 --> 45:53.421
Hey, um...

45:55.322 --> 45:56.957
Thanks, pal.

46:00.394 --> 46:02.062
Howard Leonard, I'm here
to take you to the hospital

46:02.096 --> 46:03.998
for your tests.

46:26.120 --> 46:27.388
- I've got Mr. Leonard.
- Thanks.

46:27.422 --> 46:29.190
There you go.
That's for you.

46:30.791 --> 46:32.726
So the doctor
just needs a urine sample

46:32.760 --> 46:34.295
before your appointment.

46:35.996 --> 46:37.264
No problemo.

47:25.179 --> 47:26.380
Taxi!

47:44.198 --> 47:45.467
Just here, thank you.

47:57.945 --> 47:59.447
Hi!

48:03.884 --> 48:06.488
Hello, Mr. Bronson.

48:06.521 --> 48:08.355
Oh, man.

48:08.389 --> 48:09.557
Come on.

48:15.329 --> 48:16.431
Ow.

48:19.434 --> 48:22.269
I don't know what Yelp is,
but I'm gonna find out.

48:22.303 --> 48:26.340
And when I do, I'm gonna give
this place a really bad review.

48:27.975 --> 48:29.343
And I won't be
recommending it

48:29.376 --> 48:32.212
to my friends
anytime soon either.

48:32.246 --> 48:34.148
From what I understand,

48:34.181 --> 48:38.919
you're running a bit short
in the friends department.

48:38.952 --> 48:42.590
- Why are you such a...
- Bitch?

48:42.624 --> 48:45.392
I was gonna say "hard-ass,"
but "bitch" works for me.

48:53.200 --> 48:55.102
Bao Lin.

48:55.135 --> 48:58.506
What's that supposed to mean?

48:58.540 --> 49:01.141
Bao Lin was the guard
at Ninh Hoa.

49:02.544 --> 49:03.944
Yeah? And?

49:07.582 --> 49:09.651
Do you know what Nguyen Tan
did to the guard

49:09.684 --> 49:11.385
who was held responsible
for your escape?

49:11.419 --> 49:13.555
Haven't the faintest.

49:16.156 --> 49:17.358
He was executed.

49:17.391 --> 49:18.593
Yeah.

49:22.963 --> 49:28.335
Bao Lin was an artist,
a teacher,

49:28.369 --> 49:29.571
and he was my father.

49:31.639 --> 49:34.274
He didn't want to be
in that war.

49:34.308 --> 49:40.114
After he died, we grew up
in poverty and disgrace.

49:40.147 --> 49:44.351
Eventually, we came here
and life went on, but...

49:45.953 --> 49:48.055
I still heard my mother
crying herself to sleep

49:48.088 --> 49:51.325
through the walls
in our flat.

49:51.358 --> 49:53.461
So this is about revenge?

49:55.630 --> 49:56.930
No! No.

50:01.135 --> 50:03.705
This is for your own good.

50:29.464 --> 50:32.332
- Morning, Tina.
- Morning, Norma.

50:32.366 --> 50:36.970
- Hi.
- Hello, Norma.

50:45.045 --> 50:46.280
Hi.

50:48.148 --> 50:49.751
Here's your sandwiches,
Norma.

50:49.784 --> 50:51.285
- Thanks.
- Can I get you a tea?

50:51.318 --> 50:52.754
Yes, please.

50:52.787 --> 50:55.189
- Up to the bus.
- Thank you, thank you.

50:55.222 --> 50:57.391
It's such a pleasure
as always.

50:57.425 --> 51:00.327
And off we go!

51:00.360 --> 51:02.129
I want an ice cream.

51:02.162 --> 51:05.132
We've got to keep you
in line, Pete.

52:35.122 --> 52:38.426
I'm across from the nursing
home in Linwood Street,

52:38.459 --> 52:40.662
and I think someone's escaped.

52:40.695 --> 52:43.464
There's a weird old lady
in a red jacket

52:43.498 --> 52:45.466
wandering about.

52:45.500 --> 52:46.634
Mmm.

53:01.716 --> 53:03.150
There she is.

53:17.865 --> 53:19.500
You wait here, darling.

53:19.534 --> 53:21.836
We'll find out where you belong.

53:23.303 --> 53:25.138
- Is Lin on duty?
- Yeah.

53:56.738 --> 54:01.141
Oh, Jackie.
What have they done to you?

54:04.812 --> 54:08.783
Isn't this
a rude turn of events.

54:32.239 --> 54:33.808
Here they are.

54:42.884 --> 54:44.452
Norma, sweetie?

54:46.253 --> 54:48.221
Is this a friend of yours?

54:55.630 --> 54:58.466
No, I don't think so.

55:02.003 --> 55:03.638
Let's take you home.

55:57.091 --> 55:59.594
I say we let him rot.

55:59.627 --> 56:01.729
Oh, we can't
leave a mate like this.

56:01.763 --> 56:03.931
Ah, I mean, he may be
a lying sack of shit,

56:03.965 --> 56:06.033
but he's our
lying sack of shit.

56:06.067 --> 56:09.003
Alright, then.
Bloody hell.

56:09.036 --> 56:11.439
But first things first.

56:11.472 --> 56:13.040
We're gonna need
to get him off his meds.

56:13.074 --> 56:15.643
I've been off
my meds for years.

56:15.676 --> 56:18.378
Oh, really? Huh.
Hadn't noticed.

56:18.412 --> 56:22.817
The only way to change his meds
is in the nurses' station,

56:22.850 --> 56:25.787
and we're not allowed
in there.

56:25.820 --> 56:28.623
Well, I know someone who is.

56:28.656 --> 56:30.725
Listen, kid, this is gonna
take precision timing.

56:30.758 --> 56:31.926
Precision timing.

56:31.959 --> 56:33.594
- Quick reflexes...
- Reflexes.

56:33.628 --> 56:35.062
- and grit.
- Lots of grit.

56:35.096 --> 56:37.765
Now, all the medicines
are kept in a cupboard

56:37.799 --> 56:39.433
in the nurses' station, right?

56:39.467 --> 56:41.769
So all you've gotta do
is walk in there,

56:41.803 --> 56:44.005
nice and relaxed like you're
visiting your mother

56:44.038 --> 56:46.908
like you've done a thousand
times before and then...

56:46.941 --> 56:48.843
- And this is important.
- It's important.

56:48.876 --> 56:51.913
You swap the contents
of that bottle,

56:51.946 --> 56:53.948
with Mr. Bronson's pills.

56:53.981 --> 56:54.949
Have you got that?

56:54.982 --> 56:56.417
Precision timing,

56:56.450 --> 56:58.686
quick reflexes, lots of grit.

56:58.719 --> 57:00.087
Excellent!

57:04.425 --> 57:06.093
You think he can do this?

57:06.127 --> 57:07.528
Probably not.

57:09.030 --> 57:10.598
We're on.

57:22.977 --> 57:25.413
- iPad?
- Mm-hmm.

57:25.446 --> 57:27.448
Have you finished
your English assignment?

57:27.481 --> 57:29.116
I did. Promise.

57:42.730 --> 57:43.798
Kid's a natural.

57:43.831 --> 57:45.533
Here we go.

57:54.775 --> 57:55.743
Hello?

58:00.948 --> 58:03.618
What the bloody hell's
he doing?

58:03.651 --> 58:05.620
This wasn't in the plan,
was it?

58:05.653 --> 58:06.787
No, no.

58:20.534 --> 58:22.470
What were you doing?

58:22.503 --> 58:24.872
If they run out of tablets,
what would they do?

58:24.906 --> 58:27.041
Order some more.

58:27.074 --> 58:29.744
So I changed
Bronson's prescription.

58:29.777 --> 58:32.146
- What, you're a doctor?
- How'd you do that?

58:32.179 --> 58:34.715
Medical school, probably.

58:34.749 --> 58:36.817
I just hacked the system.

58:36.851 --> 58:39.553
It's easy,
if you know the algorithms.

58:41.989 --> 58:43.691
Oh.

58:52.667 --> 58:54.535
Ah, shit.

58:59.707 --> 59:00.908
Hello, sailors.

59:02.877 --> 59:03.911
You bugger!

59:03.945 --> 59:05.179
Ha!

59:05.212 --> 59:06.781
Oh, dear.

59:09.050 --> 59:12.653
I don't remember much about that
first year back in the States.

59:14.555 --> 59:16.757
I was angry.

59:16.791 --> 59:18.726
I was in denial.

59:20.661 --> 59:23.064
And I was a drunk.

59:25.032 --> 59:26.534
I wouldn't be here

59:26.567 --> 59:30.504
if not for all the vets
who never gave up on me.

59:30.538 --> 59:34.008
Like they say,
"One day at a time."

59:34.041 --> 59:36.811
Saved my life.

59:36.844 --> 59:40.681
They even encouraged me
to write Norma.

59:40.715 --> 59:44.552
Took a while,
but she wrote me back.

59:44.585 --> 59:48.589
The Army had told her I was MIA,
presumed dead,

59:48.622 --> 59:50.624
so she resigned
her commission,

59:50.658 --> 59:53.794
taking the next plane home.

59:53.828 --> 59:58.065
After about a year,
she started seeing this doctor.

59:58.099 --> 59:59.233
Nice-enough guy.

01:00:01.802 --> 01:00:03.070
Anyway, they...

01:00:03.104 --> 01:00:05.606
They'd gotten married,
had a kid.

01:00:07.808 --> 01:00:11.112
Oh, man, I was right back
in the toilet.

01:00:11.145 --> 01:00:13.247
Thank God for meetings.

01:00:15.649 --> 01:00:18.786
Couple months later,
I get this package.

01:00:21.689 --> 01:00:23.691
She'd made me this.

01:00:26.227 --> 01:00:28.295
She wanted to know
if I needed a friend,

01:00:28.329 --> 01:00:30.131
and would she do.

01:00:31.899 --> 01:00:35.302
She wrote me every week
for nearly 50 years.

01:00:38.973 --> 01:00:41.242
This is the last one
she sent.

01:00:42.943 --> 01:00:45.179
Doesn't really
sound like her though.

01:00:46.981 --> 01:00:50.718
After her husband died,
she started to forget things,

01:00:50.751 --> 01:00:53.721
and it frightened her.

01:00:53.754 --> 01:00:57.792
Didn't wanna burden their son,
so she checked herself in here.

01:01:01.162 --> 01:01:03.097
I'm gonna ask her
to marry me.

01:01:07.334 --> 01:01:11.238
I just have to do it
before she forgets who I am.

01:01:15.309 --> 01:01:19.213
Then why make up all that
bollocks about Nguyen Tan?

01:01:19.246 --> 01:01:21.649
I couldn't take the chance
you wouldn't help me

01:01:21.682 --> 01:01:23.217
if I told you the truth.

01:01:23.250 --> 01:01:26.053
You always
overcomplicate things.

01:01:26.087 --> 01:01:28.055
Typical bloody Bronson.

01:01:28.089 --> 01:01:30.324
You could have made this
a lot easier, you know.

01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:35.096
So what's the plan?

01:01:38.099 --> 01:01:41.635
I made a few changes.
I think you'll like 'em.

01:01:41.669 --> 01:01:45.940
First, we commandeer
a vehicle,

01:01:45.973 --> 01:01:47.741
pick up Wendell's son,
Bruce,

01:01:47.775 --> 01:01:49.944
whisk the two of them off
to the footy

01:01:49.977 --> 01:01:52.313
for a little
father-and-son time.

01:01:54.148 --> 01:01:58.119
The 1973 Brownlow Medal is
on display at the clubhouse

01:01:58.152 --> 01:02:00.754
as part of
a traveling exhibit.

01:02:00.788 --> 01:02:03.958
Your Brownlow Medal, Angus.
Did you know that?

01:02:03.991 --> 01:02:07.027
You'll finally get a chance
to see it in the flesh.

01:02:09.697 --> 01:02:12.066
Then we hop on a tram,
over to the jetty,

01:02:12.099 --> 01:02:15.169
and I pop the question
to Norma.

01:02:15.202 --> 01:02:16.804
How does she get there?

01:02:16.837 --> 01:02:18.806
They're allowed one hour
of outdoor exercise

01:02:18.839 --> 01:02:20.374
every day at 5:00,

01:02:20.408 --> 01:02:23.744
so we time our arrival
to coincide with theirs

01:02:23.777 --> 01:02:25.679
and Bob's your uncle.

01:02:25.713 --> 01:02:27.681
And Fanny's your aunt.

01:02:27.715 --> 01:02:29.850
Hey, old man, do you think
you can find a way

01:02:29.884 --> 01:02:31.852
to get your boat
over to the marina?

01:02:31.886 --> 01:02:35.289
Yeah. Yeah, I think I've got
a couple of mates who'll help.

01:02:35.322 --> 01:02:37.391
Well, then, my friend,

01:02:37.425 --> 01:02:39.461
you can go out
any way you want.

01:02:42.096 --> 01:02:43.764
Um, one more thing.

01:02:43.797 --> 01:02:45.132
Any of you guys remember

01:02:45.166 --> 01:02:47.334
that guard in Nam
that helped us escape?

01:02:47.368 --> 01:02:49.069
- Mm.
- Mm.

01:02:49.103 --> 01:02:50.905
- Good bloke.
- Yeah.

01:02:50.938 --> 01:02:53.408
Nguyen Tan had him
executed for it.

01:02:53.441 --> 01:02:56.177
His name was Bao.

01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:59.880
And Lin is his daughter.

01:02:59.914 --> 01:03:01.148
Oh!

01:03:01.182 --> 01:03:04.084
I just thought you
might wanna know

01:03:04.118 --> 01:03:07.087
because if we fail...

01:03:07.121 --> 01:03:10.357
No excuses, no regrets.

01:03:10.391 --> 01:03:11.859
Yeah.

01:03:20.134 --> 01:03:22.102
You can count me in too.

01:03:22.136 --> 01:03:23.737
In what, the grave?

01:03:23.771 --> 01:03:27.107
You're not too old
for me to...

01:03:27.141 --> 01:03:28.976
put you over
my goddamn knee, boy.

01:03:29.009 --> 01:03:31.145
What the hell's
he doin' here?

01:03:31.178 --> 01:03:32.447
Remember how
we got out of De Nang?

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:34.014
Yeah, we faked Angus's death.

01:03:34.048 --> 01:03:35.517
That's right.

01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:38.453
Well, this time we're
gonna fake Hank's death.

01:03:38.486 --> 01:03:40.455
Shouldn't be too hard.

01:03:40.488 --> 01:03:42.490
We can make that work, yeah.

01:03:42.524 --> 01:03:46.428
Do you want me to mix the same
concoction I did for Angus?

01:03:46.461 --> 01:03:49.363
This plan is
bloody flawless.

01:04:03.944 --> 01:04:05.447
Hank is dead.

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:06.947
Great!

01:04:06.981 --> 01:04:09.049
No, no, no.
I mean really dead.

01:04:09.083 --> 01:04:11.553
What do you mean, dead?
You mean like dead-dead?

01:04:11.586 --> 01:04:13.187
Yeah, like a bleedin' dodo.

01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:15.155
You sure?

01:04:15.189 --> 01:04:17.157
He certainly
smells like it to me.

01:04:17.191 --> 01:04:18.426
Damn.

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:20.160
You killed him
with that shit potion.

01:04:20.194 --> 01:04:22.363
No, I didn't! He was old.

01:04:22.396 --> 01:04:23.864
Murderer.

01:04:23.897 --> 01:04:25.567
What are we gonna do now?

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:29.370
Yeah! Well, what we gonna do?

01:04:29.404 --> 01:04:31.138
No excuses, no regrets.

01:04:31.171 --> 01:04:34.174
You're right, kid.
This mission is still a go.

01:04:34.208 --> 01:04:35.543
Everyone take their positions.

01:04:35.577 --> 01:04:37.545
And, men,
bite 'em in the ass.

01:04:41.115 --> 01:04:42.216
Come on, mate.

01:04:57.131 --> 01:04:58.832
It's a good look for you.

01:04:58.866 --> 01:05:00.502
Give us a kiss.

01:05:02.136 --> 01:05:03.837
See you next time.

01:05:17.452 --> 01:05:19.554
If we don't get 'em down
with the first whack,

01:05:19.587 --> 01:05:21.322
we're in trouble.

01:05:21.355 --> 01:05:24.091
Then we better get 'em down
with the first whack.

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:28.862
Wait, he's falling.

01:05:28.896 --> 01:05:30.998
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

01:05:31.031 --> 01:05:33.867
- You were gonna hit us.
- No, we weren't.

01:05:33.901 --> 01:05:37.237
Yes, you were.
With that pole.

01:05:37.271 --> 01:05:38.540
No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:05:38.573 --> 01:05:40.874
- We're just checking.
- Yeah.

01:05:40.908 --> 01:05:42.444
Checking for what?

01:05:42.477 --> 01:05:45.346
- For what?
- It's what we do, we check.

01:05:45.379 --> 01:05:49.451
Hey, look, fellas,
appearances can be deceiving.

01:05:50.685 --> 01:05:53.053
Well, that happened.

01:05:54.388 --> 01:05:56.223
Well done, sir!

01:05:58.359 --> 01:06:00.928
Well done, Wendell.

01:06:00.961 --> 01:06:03.931
Angus, the code?

01:06:03.964 --> 01:06:06.534
We wrote it down,
and you put it in your pocket.

01:06:06.568 --> 01:06:08.536
Why would I want
to write it down?

01:06:08.570 --> 01:06:10.170
Oh, you're kidding me,
aren't you?

01:06:10.204 --> 01:06:12.906
Just jokin'.
I got it here.

01:06:14.642 --> 01:06:16.310
Yeah, well, come on, Angus.

01:06:17.412 --> 01:06:20.214
What?

01:06:20.247 --> 01:06:21.281
Wrong trousers.

01:06:21.315 --> 01:06:23.150
Oh, shit.

01:06:23.183 --> 01:06:25.052
It's alright.
I got it up here.

01:06:25.085 --> 01:06:26.521
Oh, we're buggered.

01:06:26.554 --> 01:06:29.156
Angus, I have complete
faith in you.

01:06:29.189 --> 01:06:34.995
What's the code?

01:06:35.028 --> 01:06:38.098
The first number...

01:06:38.132 --> 01:06:41.235
is... F.

01:06:41.268 --> 01:06:43.103
- What?
- What?!

01:06:43.137 --> 01:06:44.539
Bloody hell!

01:06:47.709 --> 01:06:49.176
Gentlemen!

01:06:56.518 --> 01:06:58.486
Is this part of the plan?

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:02.956
No, mate, it is not
part of the plan.

01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:04.391
What do we do now?

01:07:06.026 --> 01:07:08.362
Bronson, w-what do we do now?

01:07:08.395 --> 01:07:11.198
I don't bloody well know, OK?!

01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:16.538
Sorry, I just can't see
how to get out of this one.

01:07:16.571 --> 01:07:18.506
I can.

01:07:22.376 --> 01:07:23.711
Give us a hand.

01:07:28.783 --> 01:07:30.552
Just chuck it
on your shoulder.

01:07:34.254 --> 01:07:35.523
Bloody genius.

01:07:35.557 --> 01:07:38.526
Just like we did in Nui Dat.

01:07:39.761 --> 01:07:42.497
- There's yours.
- Thanks.

01:07:44.097 --> 01:07:46.300
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- What?

01:07:46.333 --> 01:07:49.002
It's bad luck to open
an umbrella inside.

01:07:49.036 --> 01:07:52.005
It'll be good luck
in a minute.

01:07:52.039 --> 01:07:53.974
What's it doing?

01:07:55.410 --> 01:07:56.478
Maybe it's gone out.

01:08:04.686 --> 01:08:08.188
OK, boys, let's blow
this nickel pop stand!

01:08:34.448 --> 01:08:35.550
Hey, hey, hey.

01:08:35.582 --> 01:08:37.417
Between jail
and this joint,

01:08:37.452 --> 01:08:40.488
I haven't been on
the outside since 1975.

01:08:40.522 --> 01:08:42.689
Did they tell you
about hovercars?

01:08:42.724 --> 01:08:44.258
Don't joke about that shit.

01:08:44.291 --> 01:08:46.093
I don't even know
what Twitter is.

01:08:46.126 --> 01:08:47.529
Trust me, mate,
it doesn't matter.

01:08:50.564 --> 01:08:52.099
Quickly, quickly.

01:08:52.131 --> 01:08:53.200
Come on!

01:08:59.171 --> 01:09:03.243
Well, there's the hearse.
Who's driving it?

01:09:07.549 --> 01:09:09.283
Elliot, my man!

01:09:09.316 --> 01:09:11.452
Well, you're
a Chain Breaker now.

01:09:11.486 --> 01:09:14.455
- No excuses, no regrets.
- Good on you.

01:09:14.488 --> 01:09:16.624
Get out, I'm driving.

01:09:16.658 --> 01:09:18.459
No, I'm driving.

01:09:18.493 --> 01:09:21.094
- Respect your elders, son.
- Ooh-ooh-ooh!

01:09:21.127 --> 01:09:24.732
OK, OK. Ah! Ow.

01:09:26.366 --> 01:09:28.335
Get in, ha-ha!

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:31.706
Hey!

01:09:53.359 --> 01:09:55.430
Do you think maybe we could
get a little more speed

01:09:55.463 --> 01:09:57.164
out of this crate?

01:09:57.197 --> 01:09:58.666
<i>Execute a U-turn immediately.</i>

01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:00.200
<i>You are not on
a charted course.</i>

01:10:00.233 --> 01:10:02.870
She is making me nervous.

01:10:02.904 --> 01:10:06.641
Caine, think you
can shut that thing up?

01:10:06.674 --> 01:10:09.677
<i>Execute a U-turn immediately.</i>

01:10:09.711 --> 01:10:10.845
<i>You are not on...</i>

01:10:14.415 --> 01:10:17.384
Now, which way is it?

01:10:20.755 --> 01:10:22.457
All good, all good.

01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:25.560
Straight up, straight up,
round the corner. Good.

01:10:25.593 --> 01:10:27.562
Where's my hearse?

01:10:27.595 --> 01:10:30.932
Did you move the...
They've got the hearse!

01:10:37.739 --> 01:10:39.306
There it is.

01:10:39.339 --> 01:10:40.908
Is that him
in the yard?

01:10:40.942 --> 01:10:43.945
- He's a bit, uh...
- Tubby.

01:10:43.978 --> 01:10:47.381
Just big boned.
Gets it from his mother.

01:10:50.785 --> 01:10:51.819
G'day.

01:10:51.853 --> 01:10:53.821
Are you Bruce Wendell?

01:10:53.855 --> 01:10:56.390
- Yeah.
- Bruce Lawrence Wendell?

01:10:56.424 --> 01:10:58.626
- That's me.
- We need you to come with us.

01:10:58.660 --> 01:10:59.927
Why would I do that?

01:11:01.796 --> 01:11:03.698
Just get in the hearse,
please.

01:11:03.731 --> 01:11:05.600
Mate, I'm not dead yet.

01:11:07.702 --> 01:11:09.437
Get in the hearse.

01:11:10.872 --> 01:11:12.473
That's not a gun.
It's your finger.

01:11:12.507 --> 01:11:14.341
- Oh, no, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

01:11:14.374 --> 01:11:15.877
- No!
- Then show me the gun.

01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:18.946
No!

01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:20.848
I told you not
to bring that thing.

01:11:20.882 --> 01:11:23.618
Yeah, but I brought it anyway.

01:11:23.651 --> 01:11:26.854
What do you say we get
in the hearse now?

01:11:33.628 --> 01:11:35.530
Hi, son.

01:11:35.563 --> 01:11:38.599
Oh, shit.
Let me out, will you?

01:11:38.633 --> 01:11:40.233
You wouldn't return
my letters.

01:11:40.267 --> 01:11:41.836
What, so you kidnap me?

01:11:41.869 --> 01:11:44.906
I just wanted to take you
to the footy, alright?

01:11:44.939 --> 01:11:47.642
- Who's that?
- Oh, that's Elliot.

01:11:47.675 --> 01:11:49.376
No, not the kid.
Who's in the bag?

01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:50.712
Oh, that's Hank.

01:11:50.745 --> 01:11:52.013
What happened to Hank?

01:11:52.046 --> 01:11:53.448
Caine killed him.

01:11:53.481 --> 01:11:55.348
It was natural causes!

01:11:55.382 --> 01:11:56.517
Oh, pig's ass.

01:11:57.819 --> 01:12:00.655
Now, son, how's Mom?

01:12:04.892 --> 01:12:06.627
We're never
going to get a park.

01:12:06.661 --> 01:12:08.395
Park over there.

01:12:08.429 --> 01:12:10.397
Look, right in front
of you, there.

01:12:10.431 --> 01:12:12.633
We'll get booked for that.

01:12:12.667 --> 01:12:15.570
Well, let's see.
We've assaulted two undertakers,

01:12:15.603 --> 01:12:18.005
escaped from a nursing home,
stole a hearse.

01:12:18.039 --> 01:12:19.741
And kidnapped Bruce.

01:12:19.774 --> 01:12:22.410
A parking ticket should be
the least of our worries,

01:12:22.443 --> 01:12:23.711
wouldn't you say?

01:12:23.745 --> 01:12:26.647
Alright!
I'm not paying for it.

01:12:33.353 --> 01:12:35.623
They've made some changes here.

01:12:35.656 --> 01:12:37.425
When was the last time
you were here?

01:12:37.458 --> 01:12:39.326
1968.

01:12:39.359 --> 01:12:43.898
Wow. In that case, Dad, yeah,
they've made some changes.

01:12:54.876 --> 01:12:58.311
- Come on.
- Good game, huh?

01:12:58.345 --> 01:12:59.480
Yeah, it's good.

01:13:03.885 --> 01:13:06.521
Ah! There's a big fight
going on in the canteen.

01:13:06.554 --> 01:13:08.756
You better hurry up.
Come on. Quick.

01:13:22.503 --> 01:13:25.640
I've got a hearse with what
looks like a body in the back.

01:13:35.783 --> 01:13:37.952
- You want a pie?
- Yeah.

01:13:37.985 --> 01:13:40.087
Yeah, what?

01:13:40.121 --> 01:13:41.923
Yeah, please.

01:13:41.956 --> 01:13:44.792
Two pies and two beers.

01:13:44.826 --> 01:13:47.360
And a sausage roll
as well, mate.

01:13:47.394 --> 01:13:50.097
I think you might be right
with just the pie.

01:13:52.633 --> 01:13:54.367
They found the hearse.

01:13:54.402 --> 01:13:56.771
Is that it?

01:14:01.542 --> 01:14:04.377
Yep. That's it.

01:14:04.412 --> 01:14:06.379
How many goals
did you kick?

01:14:06.414 --> 01:14:08.850
171.

01:14:08.883 --> 01:14:13.855
171, and then some bastard
playing for Carlton

01:14:13.888 --> 01:14:15.456
called me a baby killer

01:14:15.489 --> 01:14:18.125
on account of being
in Vietnam and whatnot.

01:14:18.159 --> 01:14:20.661
I broke his jaw.

01:14:23.764 --> 01:14:26.133
And I was suspended.

01:14:26.167 --> 01:14:30.638
I should've won that year,
the Brownlow Medal.

01:14:30.671 --> 01:14:32.640
But I was disqualified.

01:14:32.673 --> 01:14:35.776
What does it matter whether it's
in here or someplace else?

01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:38.378
It's yours. You earned it.

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:49.090
Ai-yi-yi-yi-yi.

01:14:49.123 --> 01:14:51.559
OK, you just...

01:14:51.592 --> 01:14:54.896
Come on, let's go. Come on.

01:15:06.774 --> 01:15:10.912
I thought...
maybe we could...

01:15:10.945 --> 01:15:12.446
Well, you know, um...

01:15:13.981 --> 01:15:15.516
Start over.

01:15:16.584 --> 01:15:18.085
Oh, that's bullshit!

01:15:18.119 --> 01:15:19.954
That was bullshit.
Did you see that dickhead?

01:15:19.987 --> 01:15:23.624
Hey, maggot, why don't you read
the AFL rulebook,

01:15:23.658 --> 01:15:25.626
instead of a comic book,
you pinhead?

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:26.961
Would you mind
watching your language?

01:15:26.994 --> 01:15:28.162
- Ah, shut up!
- Sit down.

01:15:28.195 --> 01:15:29.830
Oh, run, you mongrel, run.

01:15:29.864 --> 01:15:31.966
And you, you princess,
why not get off the grass

01:15:31.999 --> 01:15:34.902
and get on the catwalk,
prancing around like that,

01:15:34.936 --> 01:15:36.203
you clueless cock-end.

01:15:36.237 --> 01:15:38.205
- Jesus.
- Christ!

01:15:41.075 --> 01:15:42.643
What an idiot.

01:15:53.187 --> 01:15:55.489
So why didn't you write?

01:15:58.659 --> 01:16:00.861
Write?

01:16:00.895 --> 01:16:02.997
I didn't even read
the letters you sent me.

01:16:05.666 --> 01:16:09.236
Ugh, I didn't want
your stupid letters.

01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:10.604
I wanted you.

01:16:17.745 --> 01:16:22.049
You've always been the most
favorite thing I've ever done.

01:16:38.833 --> 01:16:41.202
I can't feel anything
in that leg.

01:16:54.949 --> 01:16:56.650
Come on. Let's find them.

01:16:59.053 --> 01:17:00.921
Right on schedule.

01:17:00.955 --> 01:17:02.957
Bronson.

01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:05.092
Not her.

01:17:05.126 --> 01:17:07.261
This little trip of yours
isn't exactly above board,

01:17:07.294 --> 01:17:08.763
is it?

01:17:08.796 --> 01:17:10.931
Don't worry.
I'll hold her up.

01:17:10.965 --> 01:17:13.234
Thanks, boy.

01:17:13.267 --> 01:17:14.935
See you, Dad.

01:17:14.969 --> 01:17:16.570
Yeah.

01:17:16.604 --> 01:17:17.772
Hey.

01:17:19.073 --> 01:17:20.641
Regrets are for pussies.

01:17:20.674 --> 01:17:25.946
So, um, you know, uh,
don't be a pussy.

01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:28.716
Alright, gentlemen,
move it or lose it.

01:17:31.318 --> 01:17:32.686
Hey!

01:17:46.967 --> 01:17:47.935
It's Lin!

01:17:52.407 --> 01:17:55.776
I'm sorry, boys. It's no good.
You'll have to leave me.

01:17:55.810 --> 01:17:57.711
No excuses, no regrets.

01:17:57.745 --> 01:17:59.046
Stop saying that, will ya?

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:01.348
All of us
or none of us.

01:18:01.382 --> 01:18:02.750
A tram!

01:18:10.425 --> 01:18:12.226
Cop that, you bastards!

01:18:27.274 --> 01:18:29.844
Who puts tram stops
that close together?

01:18:32.079 --> 01:18:35.282
Come on, come on!
Hurry!

01:18:51.999 --> 01:18:53.334
Give me the police.

01:19:10.851 --> 01:19:11.952
Oh, no.

01:19:11.986 --> 01:19:14.155
- What is it?
- The cops.

01:19:14.188 --> 01:19:17.124
The Old Bill.
Angus, the Old Bill!

01:19:17.158 --> 01:19:19.326
Who's Old Bill?

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:21.095
Must be a friend of Caine's.

01:19:24.098 --> 01:19:26.800
- Excuse me, sir.
- Can I help you, Officer?

01:19:26.834 --> 01:19:28.202
We're on the lookout
for some folks

01:19:28.235 --> 01:19:30.237
who've escaped
a local nursing home.

01:19:30.271 --> 01:19:34.975
Uh, no, I haven't seen anyone
that fits that description.

01:19:35.009 --> 01:19:36.810
And you, sir?

01:19:36.844 --> 01:19:40.214
- I'm on holiday.
- Holiday, where from?

01:19:40.247 --> 01:19:42.716
Ireland.
Yeah, Foxford.

01:19:46.754 --> 01:19:48.189
You're jokin'.

01:19:48.222 --> 01:19:49.990
What are the odds, huh?

01:19:50.024 --> 01:19:51.392
You're from Foxford?

01:19:51.426 --> 01:19:53.127
I'm from Cormullen,
just down the road.

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:56.197
- Jesus!
- Oh, how about that, eh?

01:19:56.230 --> 01:19:58.232
All the way over here
in Australia,

01:19:58.265 --> 01:20:00.801
we meet on a tram.

01:20:00.834 --> 01:20:02.369
How's the old
footy team goin'?

01:20:02.404 --> 01:20:04.071
Oh, they won the final.

01:20:04.104 --> 01:20:05.440
- They won?
- Uh-huh!

01:20:05.473 --> 01:20:08.410
They haven't won since 1984.

01:20:08.443 --> 01:20:10.512
Did the town have a party?
I bet they had a party.

01:20:10.545 --> 01:20:12.947
Did the town have a party!

01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:14.348
What's the name
of your people?

01:20:14.381 --> 01:20:16.418
- Marshall.
- Your dad was there.

01:20:16.451 --> 01:20:18.052
My dad's dead.

01:20:19.153 --> 01:20:20.354
Must've been your uncle.

01:20:20.387 --> 01:20:23.224
- Uncle Dennis?
- Uncle Dennis, yeah.

01:20:23.257 --> 01:20:26.026
Off his tits,
pissed as a parrot.

01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:29.029
He's been sober
for 43 years.

01:20:29.063 --> 01:20:31.131
Well, I'm sorry to
have to tell you this,

01:20:31.165 --> 01:20:33.367
but your Uncle Dennis
fell off the wagon big-time.

01:20:33.401 --> 01:20:35.035
Oh, shite.

01:20:35.069 --> 01:20:38.038
It happened when
he ran over the family dog.

01:20:38.072 --> 01:20:42.243
Brutus. He said
he'd look after him for me.

01:20:42.276 --> 01:20:45.312
Aunt Sharon didn't say
nothin' about that.

01:20:45.346 --> 01:20:47.982
Look, if you see anyone
who fits the description

01:20:48.015 --> 01:20:50.351
of the men we're after,

01:20:50.384 --> 01:20:51.986
be sure to let us know.

01:20:52.019 --> 01:20:54.822
Will do, Officer.
Thank you.

01:20:59.827 --> 01:21:01.929
What were you thinking?

01:21:03.397 --> 01:21:05.433
I was in character!

01:21:15.909 --> 01:21:19.079
Good on you, mate.

01:21:40.934 --> 01:21:43.571
Lovely day, isn't it?

01:21:43.605 --> 01:21:46.373
It is.

01:21:47.941 --> 01:21:51.211
You are so beautiful.

01:21:51.245 --> 01:21:54.114
Is that your line?

01:21:54.148 --> 01:21:55.983
You walk up and down
the jetty,

01:21:56.016 --> 01:21:58.218
telling all the girls
they're beautiful?

01:21:58.252 --> 01:22:00.888
Uh-uh. Just you.

01:22:00.921 --> 01:22:04.224
You're very sure
of yourself, aren't you?

01:22:04.258 --> 01:22:08.295
I've had a lot of time
to think about this moment.

01:22:08.329 --> 01:22:11.231
And in all this
thinking of yours,

01:22:11.265 --> 01:22:13.501
how does this moment end?

01:22:13.535 --> 01:22:16.970
Do you believe
in happy endings?

01:22:17.004 --> 01:22:18.172
Sure.

01:22:18.205 --> 01:22:21.975
So if this was
your happy ending,

01:22:22.009 --> 01:22:25.245
what do you imagine
would happen next?

01:22:25.279 --> 01:22:28.650
Maybe... you'd have a ring
in your pocket,

01:22:28.683 --> 01:22:32.052
maybe you'd slip it
on my finger,

01:22:32.086 --> 01:22:35.222
maybe we'd live
happily ever after.

01:22:37.958 --> 01:22:40.060
Do you remember
how we first met?

01:22:41.463 --> 01:22:42.630
Um...

01:22:42.664 --> 01:22:45.533
You were standing
on the jetty.

01:22:47.234 --> 01:22:49.236
I was standing
on the jetty.

01:22:49.269 --> 01:22:51.972
It was the night
before you were shipped out.

01:22:52.005 --> 01:22:55.909
You thought you looked
so handsome in your uniform.

01:22:59.079 --> 01:23:02.517
That night I thought you
were gonna propose to me.

01:23:04.452 --> 01:23:06.488
If only I had.

01:23:17.499 --> 01:23:21.335
Norma Jean McCarthy,
will you marry me?

01:23:23.738 --> 01:23:25.673
I'll have to think about it.

01:23:29.042 --> 01:23:30.578
I thought about it. Yes.

01:23:40.722 --> 01:23:42.122
Great.

01:24:17.291 --> 01:24:20.360
I'll be seeing you
real soon.

01:24:36.076 --> 01:24:37.612
Jack.

01:24:37.645 --> 01:24:40.548
Ta, mate.

01:24:40.582 --> 01:24:42.684
She got any friends?

01:24:46.086 --> 01:24:48.723
- You take care, mate.
- And you.

01:24:51.325 --> 01:24:52.427
Where are you going?

01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:54.496
God, you never pay attention.

01:24:54.529 --> 01:24:57.197
He's going for a sail.

01:24:57.231 --> 01:24:58.600
Oh.

01:24:58.633 --> 01:25:00.602
We'll see you later then.

01:25:00.635 --> 01:25:03.003
Nah,
not this time, mate.

01:25:05.205 --> 01:25:08.242
We can't just let him go
like... that.

01:25:08.275 --> 01:25:09.744
Somebody should say something.

01:25:09.777 --> 01:25:13.280
Exactly what is there
to say, Angus? Good luck?

01:25:21.255 --> 01:25:23.525
I love you, mate.

01:25:23.558 --> 01:25:25.660
Thanks, Angus.

01:25:25.693 --> 01:25:28.161
And just remember,

01:25:28.195 --> 01:25:32.433
if anything happens out there,
anything at all,

01:25:32.467 --> 01:25:36.069
even if the Navy thinks
you're a people smuggler,

01:25:36.103 --> 01:25:38.105
and you end up
in a detention center,

01:25:38.138 --> 01:25:40.441
or pirates take over your boat,

01:25:40.475 --> 01:25:43.444
or a sea monster comes...

01:25:47.114 --> 01:25:48.616
He's forgotten
what he's saying.

01:25:50.150 --> 01:25:51.853
Where was I up to?

01:25:51.886 --> 01:25:53.821
"If a sea monster
comes up..."

01:25:53.855 --> 01:25:59.460
Sea monster comes up
out of the ocean,

01:25:59.494 --> 01:26:05.098
if any of these things happen,
just remember...

01:26:05.132 --> 01:26:07.334
we'll be there.

01:26:07.367 --> 01:26:08.803
Brilliant.

01:26:10.337 --> 01:26:11.839
Ah, look, boys,
if nothing else,

01:26:11.873 --> 01:26:13.441
we had some laughs,
didn't we?

01:26:13.474 --> 01:26:17.144
- Oh, yeah.
- What more can you ask, eh?

01:27:03.791 --> 01:27:05.426
There he goes.

01:27:10.498 --> 01:27:12.199
Ah, bugger.

01:27:14.836 --> 01:27:17.505
Just leave them with us
unless there's any trouble.

01:27:19.941 --> 01:27:22.309
You're coming home, boys.

01:27:51.439 --> 01:27:53.741
Sit, Mr. Bronson.

01:27:58.413 --> 01:27:59.414
Lie down.

01:28:11.391 --> 01:28:13.828
- I asked her.
- You asked who?

01:28:13.861 --> 01:28:15.930
Norma.

01:28:15.963 --> 01:28:17.498
You asked Norma what?

01:28:17.532 --> 01:28:20.200
To marry me.

01:28:26.741 --> 01:28:28.776
You said your father
was executed

01:28:28.810 --> 01:28:31.244
for helping us escape.

01:28:33.881 --> 01:28:37.317
I remember every moment
of that night.

01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:40.588
The plan was perfect.

01:28:40.621 --> 01:28:44.559
They didn't know
we were missing.

01:28:44.592 --> 01:28:47.829
A couple more minutes,
we were home free.

01:28:47.862 --> 01:28:50.732
We came around this corner,

01:28:50.765 --> 01:28:52.834
there was your father

01:28:52.867 --> 01:28:56.704
standing between us
and the way out.

01:28:56.738 --> 01:29:00.641
I don't know who was
more surprised, him or us.

01:29:00.675 --> 01:29:03.678
We both just kinda froze.

01:29:03.711 --> 01:29:07.482
Only, he had
his weapon raised.

01:29:07.515 --> 01:29:11.052
We were unarmed.

01:29:11.085 --> 01:29:14.756
All he had to do
was pull the trigger.

01:29:14.789 --> 01:29:18.493
But he didn't.

01:29:18.526 --> 01:29:22.663
After ten of the longest
seconds of my life,

01:29:22.697 --> 01:29:24.632
he lowered his rifle,

01:29:24.665 --> 01:29:28.301
opened the gates,
stepped aside and...

01:29:28.335 --> 01:29:30.270
and we got to live.

01:29:32.974 --> 01:29:35.443
Is this one of your stories?

01:29:35.476 --> 01:29:38.713
No, uh-uh.

01:29:38.746 --> 01:29:40.681
No, it isn't.

01:29:43.618 --> 01:29:48.321
I never got a chance
to thank him.

01:29:48.355 --> 01:29:50.390
Best I can do now
is thank his daughter.

01:29:52.994 --> 01:29:56.964
Bao Lin gave his life
for ours.

01:29:59.033 --> 01:30:00.601
Thank you.

01:30:01.903 --> 01:30:03.437
We all thank you.

01:30:14.448 --> 01:30:16.349
What did she say?

01:30:20.688 --> 01:30:23.090
Oh, um...

01:30:23.124 --> 01:30:24.492
She said yes.

01:30:34.869 --> 01:30:39.473
You know this doesn't change
anything between us, right?

01:30:39.507 --> 01:30:41.409
Sure it does.

01:31:01.562 --> 01:31:04.532
<i>Jackie always believed
in happy endings.</i>

01:31:04.565 --> 01:31:08.836
<i>But of course
not everybody gets one.</i>

01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:11.606
<i>Because the thing
about happy endings</i>

01:31:11.639 --> 01:31:14.075
<i>is that they
don't just happen.</i>

01:31:14.108 --> 01:31:16.644
<i>You have to
make them happen.</i>

01:32:01.889 --> 01:32:03.190
Ohh!

01:32:05.226 --> 01:32:07.561
I was beginning to think
you'd stood me up.

01:32:07.595 --> 01:32:11.032
Well, that wouldn't be
our happy ending, would it?

01:32:11.065 --> 01:32:13.634
It certainly would not.

01:32:30.084 --> 01:32:32.853
<i>A magical unicorn cake!</i>

01:32:32.887 --> 01:32:34.522
Pass me the clicker.

01:32:34.555 --> 01:32:36.090
<i>The recipe that
we're making today</i>

01:32:36.123 --> 01:32:38.592
<i>is a fun fairy cake
from scratch.</i>

01:32:51.038 --> 01:32:53.674
Ah, thing's buggered.

01:32:54.909 --> 01:32:56.978
Hey, anyone seen Elliot?

01:32:57.011 --> 01:32:59.180
Oh, he's outside
playing with his mates.

01:33:07.221 --> 01:33:10.958
Hello, love.
Have you had your cup of tea?

01:33:19.834 --> 01:33:22.670
Oh, Jackie.

01:33:22.703 --> 01:33:24.672
Apparently,
they're all out of teabags.

01:33:24.705 --> 01:33:26.207
You don't say.

01:33:27.875 --> 01:33:28.909
Come on, boys.

01:33:28.943 --> 01:33:31.012
We got a mission.

01:33:37.785 --> 01:33:39.587
Hey! Come on, boy.

01:33:47.595 --> 01:33:49.030
Hurry up! Hurry!
