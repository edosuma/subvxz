WEBVTT

00:04.120 --> 00:05.645
I don't hunt anymore.

00:05.840 --> 00:06.887
- You quit?
- Yeah.

00:07.040 --> 00:10.487
What could possibly
make you stop just like that?

00:10.640 --> 00:12.563
- Was there a girl?
- Yeah.

00:12.760 --> 00:14.524
There was. And then there wasn't.

00:14.680 --> 00:18.366
You need to know. I didn't just drop out
I found something.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.528
- Yeah. What was her name?
- Amelia.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.722
Professor Morrison,
your government needs you.

00:22.880 --> 00:24.405
God, where'd you find this guy?

00:24.600 --> 00:26.329
He's supposed to be a top expert.

00:26.480 --> 00:27.925
- There's another tablet?
- Yes.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.321
So another word of God.
How many are there?

00:30.480 --> 00:33.962
- I just became a prophet like a year ago.
- This tablet have a name?

00:34.120 --> 00:35.929
- Demons.
- What about demons?

00:36.080 --> 00:38.765
As far as I could tell, everything.

00:42.080 --> 00:44.208
Kevin! You gotta be kidding me.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.164
- What's it say?
- Since we lost the tablet...

00:46.320 --> 00:49.722
- ...Kevin figures we don't need him.
- Crowley still does. What's he thinking?

00:49.880 --> 00:53.407
- He was our responsibility. Let's find him.
- Okay.

02:08.880 --> 02:11.167
Congratulations. You're fast.

02:12.680 --> 02:14.489
I do a lot of cardio.

02:33.360 --> 02:37.160
Wow. Guy goes to purgatory for a year,
hell breaks loose.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.721
A jogger in Minneapolis
gets his heart ripped out.

02:39.880 --> 02:42.406
- I'm guessing literally?
- Only way that interests me.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.961
And then another article
from six months ago.

02:45.120 --> 02:48.727
The same thing happens, also in
Minneapolis. What does that tell us?

02:48.920 --> 02:50.968
Stay out of Minneapolis.

02:51.320 --> 02:53.004
Two hearts ganked...

02:53.160 --> 02:56.403
...same city, six months apart.
I mean, that's gotta be a ritual.

02:56.560 --> 03:01.043
Or at least some sort of a heart-sucking
possessed satanic crack whore bat.

03:01.240 --> 03:02.571
A what?

03:02.720 --> 03:05.929
It's a case. Look, I say we hang out
the shingle again and ride.

03:06.120 --> 03:09.488
We're on a case, Dean. Kevin and
the demon tablet need to be found.

03:09.640 --> 03:11.244
So heart guy takes a number.

03:11.400 --> 03:14.529
We just spent a week chasing our asses
trying to lock Kevin down.

03:14.680 --> 03:16.682
And look at us. We're...

03:18.520 --> 03:20.329
Where the hell are we?

03:20.480 --> 03:22.244
Farmer's market.

03:22.400 --> 03:23.925
Organic.

03:25.320 --> 03:28.324
What? I had a year off.
I took time to enjoy the good things.

03:28.840 --> 03:30.683
While avoiding doing what we do.

03:30.880 --> 03:33.690
Wow. Dean, does it make you feel better
every time you say it?

03:33.880 --> 03:36.611
Man, look, I get it.
You took a year off to do yoga...

03:36.760 --> 03:39.206
...and play the lute, whatever,
but I'm back. Okay?

03:39.400 --> 03:42.529
We're back, which means we walk,
kill monsters at the same time.

03:42.680 --> 03:43.681
We'll find Kevin.

03:44.680 --> 03:46.364
But do we ignore stuff like this?

03:46.520 --> 03:50.445
Or are innocent people supposed to die
so that you can shop for produce?

03:56.120 --> 03:58.964
Here's what's odd about this thing.
The guy wasn't chopped.

03:59.120 --> 04:02.806
No incision. But his heart was
ripped out of him like a peach pit.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.924
- Was he robbed?
- Phone, watch, money, all still on him.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.526
- What about enemies?
- In town for a conference.

04:08.720 --> 04:11.087
- No connections.
- You had another one of these...

04:11.240 --> 04:14.289
- ...about six months ago?
- Yeah. And we hit a brick wall.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.482
We had nothing to go on.

04:16.640 --> 04:18.880
Thought maybe we got lucky here.

04:19.399 --> 04:21.687
A park surveillance camera
picked up something.

04:24.440 --> 04:27.922
Huh. Chubby guy the last person
to see the vic?

04:28.120 --> 04:31.602
Other than the killer. Name's Paul Hayes.
Pulled him in for questioning.

04:31.800 --> 04:34.326
- What makes you think he's clean?
- No reason not to.

04:34.480 --> 04:37.927
I mean, he said he briefly saw the victim,
ran out ahead, that was it.

04:38.120 --> 04:40.646
He didn't fall to his knees,
confess to gutting the guy?

04:40.840 --> 04:43.286
No. I mean we did
a thorough check on the guy...

04:43.440 --> 04:45.761
...not so much as a parking ticket came up.

04:45.920 --> 04:50.130
I mean, look at him. I mean, pfft, sure,
he can run a little bit, but Thor he ain't.

04:50.280 --> 04:53.841
He's gonna grab Freddy Fitness
and throw him down and rip out his heart?

04:54.040 --> 04:55.929
I don't think so.

04:56.080 --> 04:59.050
Forgive me if I didn't take him out back
and shoot him.

05:02.160 --> 05:04.128
Okay. Um, ahem.

05:05.480 --> 05:07.608
So any idea where we can find this guy?

05:17.600 --> 05:22.811
Sorry. I kind of try to stick to a
nutrition and workout schedule.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.731
- Do you want a hit?
- I'm good.

05:25.880 --> 05:27.484
- Thanks.
- Oh.

05:28.200 --> 05:32.091
So, Paul, you passed a runner,
who was later killed.

05:32.240 --> 05:35.961
- Did you speak with him at all?
- Yeah, I went over this with the cops.

05:36.120 --> 05:39.249
I... I didn't know him.
I've never spoken to him.

05:39.480 --> 05:42.131
I ran past him. I never saw him again.

05:42.320 --> 05:43.890
The end.

05:45.840 --> 05:51.006
Mm. Oh. It's disgusting. Tastes like
crap, but it keeps you young. Heh.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.601
Thanks. Too much fiber. Heh-heh.

05:53.760 --> 05:56.411
- No such thing.
- Thank you.

05:57.240 --> 05:58.401
See? Now, Paul...

05:58.560 --> 06:01.564
...we couldn't help but notice
that the jogger you outraced...

06:01.720 --> 06:05.486
- ...was a good deal younger than you.
- Yeah. And less, uh...

06:05.680 --> 06:08.126
Full-figured? Should have seen me before.

06:08.320 --> 06:12.291
Yeah, hugging a desk all day and watching
TV all night, eating fried everything.

06:12.440 --> 06:15.967
It was killing me.
I had a health scare about a year ago.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.766
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- No, it changed my life.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.605
- I started taking care of myself.
- Your body's a temple?

06:21.760 --> 06:24.366
Where I worship every day. Heh.

06:28.520 --> 06:29.521
Ahh.

06:33.240 --> 06:36.244
So, what's the word?
What'd you find, poking around at Paul's?

06:36.400 --> 06:38.880
Just the usual. Condoms, hair gel.

06:39.080 --> 06:42.721
No hex bags. Nothing satanic.
Nothing spooky.

06:42.920 --> 06:46.367
So didn't seem like a guy who'd be voted
"Most Likely to Disembowel"?

06:46.520 --> 06:48.443
They never do.

06:49.560 --> 06:51.449
Wait a minute. Here's another one.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.285
- What? Murder?
- And a do-it-yourself heart bypass.

06:54.440 --> 06:57.728
- Two days after this one.
- What part of Minneapolis?

06:57.880 --> 07:00.247
The Iowa part. Ames.

07:01.560 --> 07:04.245
Paul was being questioned.
No way that could've been him.

07:04.440 --> 07:06.329
This guy was a cop.

07:06.480 --> 07:08.960
This is exactly what happened
six months ago.

07:09.120 --> 07:11.805
Minneapolis, then Ames.

07:11.960 --> 07:13.803
Guess you missed that one.

07:14.680 --> 07:16.364
I'm just saying.

07:17.560 --> 07:22.327
Arthur Swenson. A real top-shelf officer.
Twenty years on the force.

07:22.800 --> 07:25.167
He'd ordered a pizza,
which the vic delivered.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.401
And then?

07:26.560 --> 07:28.847
The vic didn't make his next drop-off.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.606
His body was found on the walk
in front of Swenson's.

07:31.800 --> 07:34.531
- And he wasn't wearing a heart?
- No. Headless.

07:35.440 --> 07:37.727
And what about Swenson?

07:37.920 --> 07:39.410
Crumpled on the front stoop.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.921
Covered in blood, crying like a baby.

07:43.960 --> 07:46.361
Ironically, he had been in court all week.

07:46.520 --> 07:49.046
- Testifying.
- Hey, Levitt, line two.

07:49.280 --> 07:50.361
Excuse me.

07:52.320 --> 07:55.369
- Go ahead.
- That couldn't have been him in Minneapolis.

07:55.520 --> 07:57.488
I hate when this happens.

07:58.640 --> 08:02.611
So this Arthur guy, what does...?
What does he have to say?

08:03.120 --> 08:05.726
Uh... It's not real helpful.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.529
So you getting his statement?

08:18.120 --> 08:19.849
Yeah. Kind of.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.171
Probably not.

08:23.040 --> 08:25.884
It's too bad I dropped out of Lunatic 101.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.884
Whatever it is,
it sounds like he's repeating it.

08:34.400 --> 08:35.640
Look at his eyes.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.366
Hey, Arthur...

08:42.720 --> 08:44.688
...did you do this alone?

08:47.200 --> 08:51.171
Arthur, did some invisible voice tell you,
you had to kill?

08:55.120 --> 08:57.088
Now you've pissed him off.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.211
Hey, Art. Can I call you Art?

08:59.920 --> 09:04.244
Listen, I'm gonna sprinkle your arm
with holy water...

09:04.400 --> 09:07.324
...and it's gonna steam and burn
if you're possessed by a demon.

09:12.360 --> 09:13.441
He's a mushroom.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.524
Okay. Not possessed.

09:19.680 --> 09:22.889
Arthur, you wanna tell us why you did this?

09:26.440 --> 09:28.090
Okay.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.243
- So, what do you think?
- I prefer the Keith Richards version.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.727
Can you actually understand
any of the words?

10:36.880 --> 10:40.089
If they are words. Sounds
like babble to me.

10:41.360 --> 10:43.567
- Wait a second.
- What?

10:44.760 --> 10:46.842
I bought a translation app.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.280
You bought an app?

10:49.440 --> 10:50.771
Yeah.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.047
Here. Play it.

11:02.880 --> 11:06.646
And babble wins. Language unknown.

11:14.720 --> 11:16.882
Agent Sambora.

11:17.800 --> 11:19.643
What?

11:23.720 --> 11:26.769
So, Dr. Kashi, what are we looking at?
Some psychotic break?

11:26.920 --> 11:29.127
Oh, definitely. He was very thorough.

11:29.280 --> 11:32.568
Severed the optic nerve.
He was determined to remove the eye.

11:32.720 --> 11:34.404
And he used what to cut with?

11:34.560 --> 11:38.929
He doesn't look strong enough, but he broke
off the bed frame and used it as a knife.

11:39.080 --> 11:40.844
- Thank you.
- Wow.

11:41.320 --> 11:45.086
- Should put warning labels on those beds.
- Like I said, determined.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.163
I notice he had different colored eyes.

11:47.320 --> 11:51.006
Yes. Apparently he was in an accident,
where much of one eye was shattered.

11:51.160 --> 11:53.128
His vision was saved with a transplant.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.327
When was this?

11:56.680 --> 11:59.411
A year ago. Almost to the date.

11:59.560 --> 12:02.848
And interestingly, it's the
transplanted eye he chose to cut out.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.610
Really?

12:07.200 --> 12:11.046
Hey, let me ask you, is it possible
to trace the donor of a transplanted organ?

12:11.200 --> 12:14.044
- Difficult.
- But possible?

12:15.800 --> 12:17.131
Hmm.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.328
- Hey.-
- Hey.-

12:28.480 --> 12:30.926
Arthur Swenson had an eye transplant
a year ago?

12:31.080 --> 12:32.809
- Yeah.
- I remembered Paul Hayes...

12:32.960 --> 12:36.123
...was talking about a health scare
he had that changed his life.

12:36.280 --> 12:39.489
So I pulled up his medical records
from Minneapolis.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.650
You want me on board, I'm on board.

12:44.840 --> 12:47.446
Anyways, you wanna guess who,
other than Swenson...

12:47.640 --> 12:49.051
...had a transplant last year?

12:49.280 --> 12:51.601
- Paul Hayes.
- I gave it away, didn't I?

12:51.800 --> 12:54.326
We've got two suspects
in two identical murders...

12:54.480 --> 12:57.563
...in two different cities,
both had organ transplants a year ago.

12:57.760 --> 13:00.570
- Yeah. Also...
- I love when there's an also.

13:00.720 --> 13:04.327
I got to thinking about all that stuff
Arthur Swenson was talking about.

13:04.480 --> 13:07.529
Maybe your translation app
called it language unknown...

13:07.720 --> 13:11.042
...because it's a dead language
like Ancient Greek or Manx.

13:11.240 --> 13:12.844
Manx?

13:13.200 --> 13:17.364
So I e-mailed an audio file
of Arthur's mumbling to Dr. Morrison.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.085
- Who?
- Dr. Morrison.

13:19.240 --> 13:22.369
The anthropology professor
who helped us out with the Amazons?

13:23.160 --> 13:26.323
Yes. Okay. Okay.
Well, let's get our asses on the road.

13:26.480 --> 13:27.686
Headed to...?

13:27.840 --> 13:30.525
If we are in a repeat of a cycle
from six months ago...

13:30.680 --> 13:33.160
...then after the murders
in Minneapolis and in Ames...

13:33.320 --> 13:36.608
...the next heart attack was in Boulder,
Colorado.

14:01.440 --> 14:02.930
Randa?

14:04.040 --> 14:05.326
Chick, right?

14:09.040 --> 14:11.122
Loved your performance tonight.

14:12.320 --> 14:15.403
Must take... Must take years of training.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.082
Actually...

14:20.400 --> 14:22.243
...I'm kind of a natural.

14:28.480 --> 14:29.811
Uh...

14:30.200 --> 14:32.726
You know,
I don't normally do this kind of thing.

14:32.880 --> 14:34.484
Mm-hm.

14:34.680 --> 14:37.570
Um... There's just...

14:38.680 --> 14:40.808
Just something about you.

15:09.080 --> 15:13.768
All right, case is coming together. Things
are coming together, man. You and me.

15:13.920 --> 15:15.445
It is all good.

15:19.240 --> 15:20.321
Hey.

15:21.760 --> 15:24.366
- What?
- What are you thinking about? Tomatoes?

15:24.520 --> 15:26.921
I'm not thinking about anything.

15:28.760 --> 15:32.446
I don't know about you, but this last
year's given me a new perspective.

15:32.600 --> 15:36.207
- I hear you. Believe me.
- I know where I'm at my best. Right here...

15:36.360 --> 15:39.330
...driving down crazy street next to you.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.689
- Makes sense.
- Yes, it does.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.729
Or maybe you don't need me.

15:47.640 --> 15:51.884
Maybe you're at your best hacking, slicing
your way through all the world's crap alone.

15:52.040 --> 15:54.850
Not having to explain yourself to anybody.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.360
Yeah, that makes sense.

15:58.560 --> 16:01.643
Because I have so many other brothers
I can talk to about this.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.768
Look, I'm not saying I'm bailing on you.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.486
Make room for the possibility
we want different things.

16:06.640 --> 16:09.689
- I want my time to count for something.
- So, what we do doesn't count?

16:15.640 --> 16:16.971
Yeah?

16:17.400 --> 16:19.482
Hey, Dr. Kashi.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.527
Okay. Thank you.

16:22.680 --> 16:25.047
Could you run one more name for me?

16:25.200 --> 16:27.487
Yeah. Hayes, Paul.

16:28.200 --> 16:32.171
Uh-huh. And the donor? Seriously?

16:33.240 --> 16:34.844
How many others?

16:35.800 --> 16:39.486
Yeah, did anybody from Boulder, Colorado
receive any of those organs?

16:40.160 --> 16:41.446
Okay. Thank you.

16:43.680 --> 16:46.524
Well, this is gonna singe your axons.

16:46.680 --> 16:51.891
She says that both Paul Hayes's kidney
and Arthur Swenson's new eye came from...

16:52.040 --> 16:53.405
You ready for this?

16:53.560 --> 16:54.686
...Brick Holmes.

16:56.720 --> 16:58.609
- You don't mean the Brick Holmes?
- I do.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.211
- All-pro quarterback?
- Indeed.

17:00.360 --> 17:02.931
Guy played at the top of his game
for a million years.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.441
Yeah, he bought it in a
car crash last year.

17:05.599 --> 17:08.365
- Yeah.
- Nose-dived off a bridge or something?

17:08.520 --> 17:10.761
He must have signed a donor card.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.883
The doc say how many organs he donated?

17:13.240 --> 17:15.128
Including our two suspects? Eight.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.361
- Eight?
- Eight.

17:16.520 --> 17:19.046
Okay, and one of them's in Boulder,
am I right?

17:19.200 --> 17:21.167
You would be wrong. That's the bad news.

17:21.319 --> 17:23.891
Good news is,
Brick lived just outside of Boulder.

17:24.599 --> 17:28.082
- Well, Brick's dead.
- He's all we got. So we are going to Boulder.

18:38.920 --> 18:41.526
I wanna say how sorry we are for your loss,
Mrs. Holmes.

18:41.760 --> 18:44.331
- Thank you.
- Brick was my idol back in high school.

18:44.480 --> 18:46.289
Amazing career.

18:46.440 --> 18:49.569
Eighteen seasons. Seven division
championships. Four Super Bowls.

18:49.720 --> 18:51.563
Never slowed down a day.

18:51.720 --> 18:55.850
Brick lived for competition
and athletic perfection.

18:56.040 --> 19:00.250
I don't think it occurred to his fans
that he was human like the rest of us.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.920
Do you know your son
was an organ donor?

19:03.920 --> 19:06.810
Does that make this a matter for the FBI?

19:07.040 --> 19:12.001
Like we explained earlier, we're mostly
here to dot some I's on a different matter.

19:12.160 --> 19:14.925
There was a public awareness thing
a few years ago.

19:15.080 --> 19:19.165
A lot of star athletes signed on. I'm
sure Brick didn't think twice about it...

19:19.320 --> 19:21.891
...since he never thought
he was going to die.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.849
Lot of jocks are like that, I guess.

19:25.160 --> 19:28.881
You know, I can't help but wonder
what happened that night on that bridge.

19:29.040 --> 19:32.010
There was light traffic.
No alcohol involved. No skid marks.

19:32.160 --> 19:34.447
Bigtime athlete, reflexes like a cat.

19:34.600 --> 19:37.524
How is it that he just
drives off the side of a bridge?

19:37.680 --> 19:40.843
When things happen
that aren't supposed to happen...

19:41.000 --> 19:43.844
...they're called accidents, I believe.

19:44.760 --> 19:47.286
So everybody knows about
Brick's football career...

19:47.440 --> 19:49.841
...but no one knows much
about his personal life.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.611
- Was he ever married?
- Just to the game.

19:52.760 --> 19:54.524
He gave it everything he had.

19:54.680 --> 19:56.409
It's a difficult life.

19:56.560 --> 19:59.450
Did you notice any changes
in Brick before he died?

19:59.600 --> 20:03.571
- Anyone, anything new in his life?
- No, no. I don't think so.

20:03.800 --> 20:08.089
So no new interests?
Fly fishing, stamp collecting, the occult?

20:09.080 --> 20:11.811
- The occult?
- As for instance.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.291
No. Heh.

20:13.520 --> 20:16.410
Everything was just as it had been.

20:16.560 --> 20:19.723
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid my time is up.

20:19.920 --> 20:23.481
The university is naming
a new athletic building after Brick.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.246
- I can't be late.
- Of course. Just one more question.

20:26.400 --> 20:30.405
There is always one more question in life,
isn't there?

20:30.560 --> 20:32.528
That's what I find.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.645
Right.

20:37.760 --> 20:40.081
Well, she didn't wanna say much, did she?

20:40.240 --> 20:42.641
- Son of a bitch. There it is. It happened.
- What?

20:42.880 --> 20:45.247
Don't tell me
someone had their heart ripped out.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.289
All right, then I won't tell you.

20:56.600 --> 20:58.602
What are you doing here, Randa?

20:58.800 --> 21:02.202
You know I like to stay close
to the mother ship.

21:04.040 --> 21:07.761
I saw a car out front,
so I came in the back.

21:08.560 --> 21:09.607
Cops?

21:10.760 --> 21:15.448
I suppose Brick's death continues
to fascinate.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.602
So we're clear...

21:18.680 --> 21:21.160
...you're still being careful
about what you say?

21:21.320 --> 21:24.290
I'm old, Randa, not an idiot.

21:24.440 --> 21:27.569
- I'm just trying to protect Brick.
- And so am I.

21:27.760 --> 21:30.650
Brick's heart beats inside here now.

21:30.960 --> 21:32.803
Brick gave me new life.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.291
I can feel him.

21:34.440 --> 21:36.488
It's why I moved to Boulder.

21:36.640 --> 21:38.881
To be near here.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.242
And I'll watch out for you like Brick did.

21:41.440 --> 21:43.010
I don't need your concern.

21:43.160 --> 21:44.286
We need each other.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.807
And Brick needs us.

21:48.640 --> 21:54.841
You keep our little secret safe,
and the three of us will be just fine.

21:57.320 --> 22:00.051
All right, Professor Morrison.
That does it.

22:00.200 --> 22:02.487
The FBI thanks you.

22:03.320 --> 22:08.201
Yes, I am totally looking into adding
you as a technical advisor.

22:09.160 --> 22:13.165
Yeah, it comes with a medical plan.
All right. Goodbye.

22:13.320 --> 22:15.004
He come through?

22:15.160 --> 22:16.685
Yeah. He did.

22:16.840 --> 22:22.643
All right. So here's what crazy Arthur
Swenson was babbling over and over.

22:23.160 --> 22:25.527
First, it is a dead language.

22:25.680 --> 22:28.206
- Ancient Mayan.
- Doesn't get much deader than that.

22:28.360 --> 22:33.002
So, what Arthur was saying was,
"The divine god Cacao is born."

22:33.200 --> 22:34.884
"Cacao"?

22:35.160 --> 22:38.289
Cacao. Yeah. The Mayan god of maize.
Corn. The big crop.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.408
See, Cacao was the most powerful god...

22:40.560 --> 22:43.450
...because maize was
the most important thing to the Mayas.

22:43.640 --> 22:45.847
And torturing and killing
everyone in sight.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.130
This is what we're looking for is a
thousand-year-old culture's god of corn?

22:51.200 --> 22:53.521
- I guess.
- Whatever it is, we better cap it quick.

22:53.720 --> 22:56.530
Or somebody in Phoenix is next
to get their heart yanked.

22:56.680 --> 22:58.409
Someone in Phoenix got a piece of Brick?

22:58.600 --> 23:00.523
I got a name. Just e-mailed the cops.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.968
Just heard back from them.
They haven't seen the guy in days.

23:04.120 --> 23:07.727
Uh... I've got another e-mail here too.
This one's for you.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.370
From a university.

23:09.520 --> 23:11.761
Answering questions about admissions.

23:13.320 --> 23:15.687
Just something I'm looking into. An option.

23:15.840 --> 23:18.320
You're seriously talking about
hanging it up?

23:18.480 --> 23:21.609
I'm not talking about anything, Dean.
I'm just looking at options.

23:23.600 --> 23:27.605
So we just go to Phoenix, and chase our
tails until this guy shows his face?

23:27.800 --> 23:30.531
No. Brick Holmes is the way into this.

23:30.720 --> 23:33.644
Eleanor Holmes was doing her damndest
not to tell us a thing.

23:33.800 --> 23:36.246
Nice job changing the subject, though.

23:42.200 --> 23:45.363
All right. Naming ceremony's over at 10.
We gotta get in and out.

23:45.520 --> 23:46.851
- Master bedroom.
- Yeah.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.490
Closets.

24:00.920 --> 24:05.130
Brick's closet. Doesn't look like
this stuff's been touched in a year.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.129
Man, what this stuff would go for on eBay.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.201
Hey, Sammy...

24:15.360 --> 24:20.241
...would it totally crush you to know that
your boy Brick wasn't a natural blond?

24:21.760 --> 24:24.570
- Dean, this is really weird.
- What do you got?

24:24.720 --> 24:27.451
I don't know, is this Eleanor's closet?

24:27.600 --> 24:30.843
Why would his mother's closet be in here?
Are you sure?

24:33.320 --> 24:34.481
Check this out.

24:37.680 --> 24:39.682
This is what she was wearing today.

24:39.840 --> 24:43.003
Maybe she moved into Brick's room
after he died?

24:46.920 --> 24:48.490
Or...

24:51.760 --> 24:53.125
Oh.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.210
Thanks, Dean. Now that image
is permanently etched into my retinas.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.725
That's what I'm talking about.

25:30.680 --> 25:35.447
Wow. I knew he'd have something like this
in his house.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.887
This is a lot of hardware.

25:38.360 --> 25:41.569
Okay, the football trophies I get.
But there's a lot of stuff here.

25:41.720 --> 25:44.803
I mean, baseball, boxing. Race car driving?

25:46.080 --> 25:47.730
He was a fan.

25:47.880 --> 25:51.043
Any kind of athlete, he respected them.
Look at all the old stuff.

25:51.200 --> 25:52.611
Cricket mallet.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.888
Golf clubs, a kendo sword.

25:55.040 --> 25:56.644
Archery equipment.

26:05.440 --> 26:06.487
Hey, look at this.

26:12.240 --> 26:16.131
They're all the same. "Dearest Betsy,"
blah, blah, blah. Who's Betsy?

26:17.400 --> 26:20.290
I don't know. Girlfriend?
Eleanor didn't mention a Betsy.

26:23.240 --> 26:25.083
This one looks old. Uh...

26:25.400 --> 26:28.927
"Dearest Betsy. Third day of training camp.
Roadwork improving.

26:29.080 --> 26:33.165
Working on my left jab. They say this kid
Sugar Ray is going to be tough."

26:33.400 --> 26:37.371
Sugar Ray? As in Robinson?
Didn't he box in, like, the '40s?

26:37.520 --> 26:39.648
- Is it signed the same?
- Yeah.

26:39.800 --> 26:41.450
"Love, me."

26:41.760 --> 26:43.762
Here. "Dearest Betsy. On the road again.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.684
So hard to be away from you, honey.

26:45.840 --> 26:48.161
Will give the Red Sox hell
and get back to you."

26:48.320 --> 26:51.051
- "Dearest Betsy."
- "Le Mans'll be a bitch with the rain."

26:51.200 --> 26:54.204
- "Phillies are tough."
- "Dodgers'll wish they never left."

26:54.360 --> 26:55.964
"Looking for my best gal Friday."

26:56.120 --> 26:58.487
"Our O-Line hung tough.
I had all day back there."

26:58.640 --> 27:00.369
"Prost's a monster in straightaway."

27:00.520 --> 27:02.249
- "Dearest Betsy."
- "Dearest Betsy."

27:02.400 --> 27:05.927
- "Love, me."
- Wait. This one looks recent.

27:06.080 --> 27:09.801
"Dearest Betsy. So tired of it all."

27:17.320 --> 27:21.405
Hey. I pulled up the names on
those trophies. Check it out.

27:24.480 --> 27:26.767
All right. Brick Holmes, football player.

27:26.920 --> 27:28.490
Charlie Karnes, race-car driver.

27:28.640 --> 27:31.166
Davey Samuelson, baseball player.
Kelly Duran, boxer.

27:31.320 --> 27:33.163
- Four different guys, right?
- Okay.

27:33.320 --> 27:35.049
Check this out.

27:39.320 --> 27:43.006
Same dark eyes. Same cheekbones.
Nose. Mouth.

27:43.160 --> 27:46.243
You saying these guys,
who all look to be in their mid-20s...

27:46.440 --> 27:49.683
...and go back 70 years,
could be the same guy?

27:51.240 --> 27:52.526
Wow.

27:52.840 --> 27:55.730
For a 95-year-old,
Brick Holmes could take a hit.

28:01.960 --> 28:05.681
So if all those athletes were the same guy,
how'd he pull it off?

28:05.880 --> 28:10.488
Appear, then go away
and come back with a new look?

28:10.640 --> 28:12.847
Cacao, the maize god, was Mayan, right?

28:13.040 --> 28:14.041
Yeah.

28:14.200 --> 28:18.250
The Maya were all about war and torture
and conquest, and sports.

28:18.400 --> 28:20.368
"Their athletes were treated like kings."

28:20.520 --> 28:24.286
The Mayan jocks made sacrifices
to Cacao by... Ready for this?

28:24.440 --> 28:27.205
"Killing a victim, pulling out his heart
and eating it.

28:27.720 --> 28:29.085
They believed the rituals...

28:29.240 --> 28:33.370
...gave them super-charged power
over their opponents."

28:33.560 --> 28:36.291
Yeah, but they didn't stay young forever.

28:36.480 --> 28:40.201
So what, maybe Brick just made
some kind of deal with this Cacao?

28:40.440 --> 28:43.330
We've seen it before,
people making deals with demons, gods.

28:43.480 --> 28:47.121
Maybe he stayed young and strong
so long as his sacrifices kept coming.

28:47.280 --> 28:49.851
Remember all that antique
sports equipment he had?

28:50.000 --> 28:52.526
This guy could go back to the Mayan days.

28:52.680 --> 28:59.928
Wow. So one of the greatest QBs to ever
play the game was over 900 years old.

29:00.080 --> 29:03.880
Well, that explains Brick, but what about
the mooks carrying his spare parts?

29:04.640 --> 29:09.009
Maybe the spell went along for the ride,
infected the people who got his organs.

29:09.200 --> 29:12.568
Remember Paul Hayes said he had
a health scare that changed his life?

29:12.720 --> 29:15.610
Maybe the spell could compel him
to carry out the ritual.

29:15.800 --> 29:17.529
It's like getting bit by a werewolf.

29:17.680 --> 29:21.082
Once you're infected, you do what you
gotta do if you like the results.

29:21.320 --> 29:25.689
Right. Except old Arthur, the dedicated
cop, couldn't handle it and went nuts.

29:29.480 --> 29:33.201
Brick Holmes. A heart eater. Who knew?

29:33.360 --> 29:36.523
Yeah. Sorry, buddy.
The mighty, they fall hard, huh?

29:38.720 --> 29:41.690
Well, at least he wasn't
sleeping with his mother.

29:41.880 --> 29:44.281
Yeah. Good, Sam. Find the silver lining.

29:45.280 --> 29:46.611
No. Seriously, look.

29:52.800 --> 29:56.122
"Fighter Kelly Duran is congratulated
on his second-round knockout...

29:56.280 --> 29:57.805
...by wife Betsy."

29:58.800 --> 30:00.643
Dearest Betsy.

30:06.080 --> 30:07.570
Hello, Eleanor.

30:07.800 --> 30:10.406
Or would you rather us call you Betsy?

30:11.800 --> 30:14.246
Look, Eleanor, innocent people are dying.

30:14.400 --> 30:17.609
And they're gonna continue to die
until we stop it.

30:19.640 --> 30:22.086
Did you know about the murders
over the past year?

30:24.600 --> 30:27.080
No. I didn't. I swear.

30:27.240 --> 30:31.484
I thought when Brick died
it would be over.

30:31.720 --> 30:32.960
Help us.

30:33.800 --> 30:36.644
Betsy, this is not what you want
Brick's legacy to be.

30:41.480 --> 30:44.962
His Mayan name was lnyo.

30:45.160 --> 30:51.725
He was a proud young athlete
nearly a thousand years ago.

30:51.920 --> 30:56.403
He lived for sport and never wanted
his days in the sun to end.

30:57.320 --> 31:02.724
So he arranged a bargain with the god Cacao
through a high priest.

31:02.920 --> 31:03.921
Stay young forever.

31:04.080 --> 31:08.290
As long as the sacrifices continued
twice a year.

31:08.440 --> 31:11.284
Once for the planting, once for harvest.

31:11.480 --> 31:16.884
- When did you find out about this?
- Not until I began to age and Brick...

31:17.200 --> 31:20.170
Kelly, as he was when I met him.

31:20.680 --> 31:22.205
...Did not.

31:22.440 --> 31:26.047
But by that time, Brick
himself had changed.

31:26.200 --> 31:27.884
Inside.

31:28.080 --> 31:33.405
He wasn't just the warrior whose
only reason for living was combat.

31:33.840 --> 31:37.845
We were deeply, deeply in love.

31:38.040 --> 31:39.565
So in love, I'm ashamed to say...

31:39.720 --> 31:44.931
...that when I found out how
my husband stayed young and strong...

31:45.120 --> 31:46.849
...I chose to ignore it.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.641
You and Brick had to go underground
from time to time to hide your secret?

31:50.880 --> 31:56.364
Every 10 years or so he would reemerge
with a new look, a new name.

31:57.200 --> 32:00.090
And me, I was the wife.

32:00.240 --> 32:03.050
And I was the woman in hiding.

32:03.200 --> 32:06.170
And then, when I got into my 40$...

32:06.360 --> 32:10.524
...I became Brick's mother.

32:11.280 --> 32:12.930
Eleanor.

32:16.520 --> 32:19.603
I am so tired.

32:19.800 --> 32:22.565
You can't imagine the burden of it all.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.842
I think even Brick was through.

32:25.040 --> 32:28.726
He could see
the end of my days were at hand.

32:29.280 --> 32:33.365
He had lived centuries all alone...

32:34.240 --> 32:38.165
...but I don't think he could bear
the thought of life without me.

32:39.560 --> 32:42.211
That's why he drove off that bridge.

32:48.240 --> 32:51.403
- You must think I'm a monster.
- No.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.602
No. Just that you married one.

32:56.560 --> 32:57.891
Well, see, here's the deal.

32:58.040 --> 33:02.090
Now there are eight killers out there
that we have to deal with.

33:02.240 --> 33:03.571
Not just one.

33:04.200 --> 33:05.361
I don't think so.

33:06.400 --> 33:08.243
What? Why not?

33:08.400 --> 33:12.405
Brick used to say the hear': was key.

33:12.800 --> 33:16.088
That was the focus of the sacrifice.

33:16.240 --> 33:19.847
Are you saying that if we stop
Brick's beating heart...

33:20.000 --> 33:21.843
...then we could stop the whole thing?

33:25.240 --> 33:28.210
Do you know where the person is
who has the heart?

33:29.760 --> 33:31.091
Do you know?

33:42.040 --> 33:45.123
Really?
Our king daddy monster is a stripper?

33:45.320 --> 33:48.005
We're pretty sure this is gonna work,
right?

33:48.320 --> 33:52.689
Well, as long as Eleanor knows
what she's talking about.

33:55.840 --> 33:59.447
Think Brick thought maybe he'd burn
to nothing when he crashed that car?

33:59.640 --> 34:02.007
Yeah. But he didn't. Which brings us here.

34:43.280 --> 34:45.089
Smell that?

34:46.000 --> 34:47.842
You're gross.

35:16.600 --> 35:19.126
Eleanor sent you, right?

35:20.480 --> 35:23.404
Figured she'd probably break
and give me up.

35:23.640 --> 35:26.644
This won't end well for her, of course.

35:27.440 --> 35:29.647
Not that it's gonna end well for you.

35:32.920 --> 35:35.764
Now, you don't think we're gonna
let you do that, do you?

35:35.920 --> 35:37.410
We?

35:44.680 --> 35:47.286
I'm the guy from Phoenix
you were looking for.

35:55.480 --> 35:58.484
- You guys are stronger than you look.
- Comes with the package.

35:58.640 --> 36:00.210
Plus, I work out a lot.

36:00.880 --> 36:02.166
Ugh.

36:03.880 --> 36:05.530
You can't imagine who I was before.

36:06.480 --> 36:11.281
This shy, awkward little thing from Georgia
with a heart condition.

36:11.480 --> 36:12.686
Then I had the surgery.

36:14.880 --> 36:18.327
I became freaking Xena, warrior princess.

36:21.440 --> 36:24.284
I couldn't dissect a frog in high school.

36:24.480 --> 36:27.404
But sacrificing to Cacao?

36:27.560 --> 36:28.800
Better than sex.

36:30.920 --> 36:33.048
So if I go real slow...

36:34.000 --> 36:38.324
...and take my time and enjoy this...

36:38.760 --> 36:44.164
...I can actually show you
your own beating hear': before you die.

37:37.720 --> 37:39.688
Well, we better get going.

37:39.840 --> 37:43.367
Just wanted you to know
that it really is over now.

37:43.520 --> 37:47.206
Well, it had to be. One way or the other.

37:47.520 --> 37:52.242
I half thought you might fail
and Randa would come after me.

37:52.440 --> 37:56.126
Either way, I'd finally be at peace.

37:58.760 --> 38:01.286
You take care of yourself, Eleanor.

38:07.320 --> 38:09.448
Wow. Back in business.

38:09.640 --> 38:11.130
Got the win.

38:11.280 --> 38:13.647
Admit it, it feels good, huh?

38:13.880 --> 38:16.121
I was thinking about
what Randa said about...

38:16.280 --> 38:18.123
...what it feels like to be a warrior.

38:19.080 --> 38:21.287
I get it, man. I do.

38:21.520 --> 38:23.648
I know. I know you do.

38:24.760 --> 38:26.569
I don't.

38:26.880 --> 38:28.769
Not anymore. Hell, maybe I never did.

38:28.920 --> 38:31.127
Come on, Sam, don't ruin my buzz,
would you?

38:31.280 --> 38:36.320
Dean, listen, when this is over, when we
close up shop on Kevin and the tablet...

38:37.040 --> 38:38.405
...I'm done. I mean that.

38:38.960 --> 38:40.246
No, you don't.

38:41.560 --> 38:45.201
Dean, the year that I took off,
I had something I've never had.

38:46.880 --> 38:50.566
A normal life.
I mean, I got to see what that felt like.

38:53.800 --> 38:55.564
I want that.

38:56.280 --> 38:57.691
I had that.

38:59.240 --> 39:02.289
I think that's just how you feel right now.

39:09.680 --> 39:13.241
Amelia? Amelia, this isn't funny.

39:14.960 --> 39:16.849
Amelia?

39:20.640 --> 39:22.085
Riot?

39:23.160 --> 39:24.525
Riot!

39:28.800 --> 39:30.529
Happy birthday.

39:34.480 --> 39:35.845
What is this?

39:36.000 --> 39:38.810
You've never seen a birthday cake before?

39:40.520 --> 39:43.729
Sit. Eat.
