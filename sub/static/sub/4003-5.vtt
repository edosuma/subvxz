11:56.000 --> 12:00.583
- LUNDY HAD THIS LOOK
IN HIS EYES.

12:00.583 --> 12:06.458
LIKE HE WAS APOLOGIZING.

12:06.458 --> 12:10.417
I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING.

12:10.417 --> 12:13.166
I WAS HELPLESS.

12:16.250 --> 12:17.625
FUCK, I CAN'T EVEN WALK

12:17.625 --> 12:19.417
THREE FEET TO THE BATHROOM.

12:19.417 --> 12:21.291
- DO YOU NEED TO--?

12:21.291 --> 12:24.208
- YEAH. BAD.

12:24.208 --> 12:26.834
- COME ON.

12:34.583 --> 12:35.583
OKAY?

12:35.583 --> 12:40.291
- MM-HMM.

12:40.291 --> 12:43.250
- I MAY NOT KNOW
WHO SHOT MY SISTER,

12:43.250 --> 12:46.583
OR WHY HER LIFE WAS SPARED,

12:46.583 --> 12:50.208
BUT I DO KNOW I WON'T
BE RETURNING THE FAVOR.

12:56.542 --> 12:58.208
- OH, GOD.
DEB, IS SHE--?

12:58.208 --> 13:03.417
- PEEING.

13:03.417 --> 13:06.333
I'LL JUST--UH...

13:06.333 --> 13:08.417
BE OUTSIDE.

13:11.875 --> 13:12.750
HEY.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.417
- HOW'S DEB?

13:14.417 --> 13:17.083
- SHE'S LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.

13:17.083 --> 13:19.291
- I WAS SO WORRIED.

13:19.291 --> 13:20.959
CAN I SEE HER?

13:20.959 --> 13:23.125
- UH, SHE'S PEEING.

13:23.125 --> 13:26.959
WITH ANTON.

13:26.959 --> 13:28.750
- I WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE SOONER,

13:28.750 --> 13:30.375
BUT I GOT HUNG UP
ON THE PHONE.

13:30.375 --> 13:31.625
YOUR LANDLORD CALLED.

13:31.625 --> 13:34.041
A PIPE BURST IN YOUR KITCHEN...

13:34.041 --> 13:36.208
AT YOUR APARTMENT?

13:36.208 --> 13:39.625
- OH.

13:39.625 --> 13:42.166
I WAS JUST
HANGING ON TO THE PLACE

13:42.166 --> 13:43.709
UNTIL THE LEASE RAN OUT.

13:43.709 --> 13:46.041
SO I COULD GET
THE SECURITY DEPOSIT BACK.

13:46.041 --> 13:48.291
- WHY'D YOU TELL ME
YOU GOT RID OF IT?

13:48.291 --> 13:49.291
- I SAID THAT?

13:49.291 --> 13:52.500
[Harrison crying]

13:52.500 --> 13:53.583
- TALK ABOUT THIS LATER.

13:53.583 --> 13:54.750
THIS ISN'T
THE TIME OR THE PLACE,

13:54.750 --> 13:57.333
NOT WITH DEB HERE.

13:57.333 --> 14:01.834
FAMILY COMES FIRST.

14:01.834 --> 14:04.875
- I'M JUST SO SORRY
I WASN'T HERE.

14:04.875 --> 14:07.667
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO KEEP SAYING THAT.

14:07.667 --> 14:11.041
- SO GLAD YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

14:11.041 --> 14:13.125
- I'M NOT.

14:13.125 --> 14:14.959
- BABE, WHAT IS IT?

14:20.000 --> 14:22.041
- I SLEPT WITH LUNDY.

14:31.166 --> 14:34.500
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE HAPPY.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.875
- I THOUGHT I WAS TOO.

14:40.750 --> 14:42.500
I CAN MOVE OUT.

14:42.500 --> 14:45.083
- NO. NO. NO.

14:45.083 --> 14:47.250
LISTEN, I'LL SEE YOU
THROUGH THIS, OKAY?

14:47.250 --> 14:48.291
YOU DID THE SAME FOR ME.

14:48.291 --> 14:52.625
- ANTON, STOP.

14:52.625 --> 14:56.667
YOU DESERVE SO MUCH BETTER.

14:56.667 --> 14:59.500
- IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

15:04.375 --> 15:06.917
- SORRY I HURT YOU.

15:22.542 --> 15:24.375
- ANTON?

15:31.250 --> 15:34.083
- [s- GRACIAS. ish]

15:34.083 --> 15:36.208
JUST HUNG UP FROM NOTIFYING
LUNDY'S DAUGHTER.

15:36.208 --> 15:37.417
- THEN YOU COULD REALLY USE

15:37.417 --> 15:40.834
A SHOT OF WHISKEY IN THERE.

15:40.834 --> 15:44.834
I GET THAT THE GUY'S
PERSONALLY INVESTED IN THIS,

15:44.834 --> 15:46.959
BUT MATTHEWS HOVERING AROUND
LIKE A VULTURE

15:46.959 --> 15:48.625
ISN'T GONNA HELP US
CATCH BAD GUYS.

15:48.625 --> 15:52.750
- ANGEL...

15:52.750 --> 15:54.417
I MADE
OFFICIAL DISCLOSURE YESTERDAY

15:54.417 --> 15:58.917
THAT WE'RE SEEING EACH OTHER.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.333
- WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

16:00.333 --> 16:03.875
- I KNOW.

16:03.875 --> 16:05.625
BUT IT WAS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

16:05.625 --> 16:09.083
- I SAID I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH THE DISCLOSURE STUFF,

16:09.083 --> 16:10.500
AND YOU GO AHEAD
AND DO IT ANYWAY?

16:10.500 --> 16:12.458
- I MADE A JUDGMENT CALL.

16:12.458 --> 16:16.709
- THE PROBLEM, MARIA,

16:16.709 --> 16:20.125
IS THAT YOU MADE IT
FOR THE BOTH OF US.

16:20.125 --> 16:23.917
YOU SHOULDN'T KEEP
THE DEPUTY CHIEF WAITING.

16:26.583 --> 16:29.166
- [sighs]

16:36.250 --> 16:37.625
- WHAT DO WE GOT?

16:37.625 --> 16:38.959
- NOT MUCH.

16:38.959 --> 16:40.417
NO WITNESSES,
NO SECURITY CAMERAS.

16:40.417 --> 16:41.417
TOOK A STATEMENT FROM DEB,

16:41.417 --> 16:42.834
SHE CAN'T REMEMBER
SEEING ANYTHING.

16:42.834 --> 16:44.208
- FORENSICS.

16:44.208 --> 16:45.834
- WAITING ON TRACE
AND BALLISTICS FROM THE LAB.

16:45.834 --> 16:47.959
- APBs OUT ON ROSE AND WALD.

16:47.959 --> 16:49.834
COUNTY'S INCREASED
PATROLS AT THE AIRPORT

16:49.834 --> 16:51.291
AND THE HIGHER PROFILE
TOURIST HOTELS.

16:51.291 --> 16:52.667
- IF MY FACE
WAS ALL OVER THE MEDIA

16:52.667 --> 16:54.792
FOR SHOOTING A COP AND A FED,

16:54.792 --> 16:56.250
I'D BE DIGGING A FUCKING HOLE

16:56.250 --> 16:58.583
ALL THE WAY TO CHINA.

16:58.583 --> 17:00.208
NO ONE FUCKIN' GO THERE.

17:00.208 --> 17:01.875
- OR YOU'D BE WATCHING THE PRESS

17:01.875 --> 17:03.667
TO TRY AND STAY ONE STEP
AHEAD OF US.

17:03.667 --> 17:04.583
IT'S A HAIL MARY,

17:04.583 --> 17:05.709
BUT I PLANTED A STORY

17:05.709 --> 17:07.083
WITH QUINN'S GIRLFRIEND.

17:07.083 --> 17:08.500
- SHE'S NOT--
WE'RE NOT--

17:08.500 --> 17:10.250
- YOU'RE THE PAPER'S
UNNAMED ONLINE SOURCE

17:10.250 --> 17:11.208
ABOUT JOHNNY BOY'S DRIP?

17:11.208 --> 17:14.083
- I FIGURE
IF JOHNNY HAS SYPHILIS

17:14.083 --> 17:15.959
AND NIKKI WASN'T LISTED
BY THE COUNTY

17:15.959 --> 17:17.542
AS ONE
OF HIS SEXUAL PARTNERS...

17:17.542 --> 17:18.834
- SHE MAY NOT KNOW.

17:18.834 --> 17:22.083
- EXACTLY.

17:22.083 --> 17:25.417
MAYBE WE TURN THESE TWO
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

17:28.208 --> 17:29.792
- RITA WAS RIGHT.

17:29.792 --> 17:31.583
FAMILY DOES COME FIRST.

17:31.583 --> 17:35.208
FINDING WHO DID THIS
TO MY SISTER COMES FIRST.

17:35.208 --> 17:37.375
IS THIS
A NEW PAGE OF THE CODE?

17:37.375 --> 17:40.500
REVENGE?

17:43.542 --> 17:46.000
MY SANCTUARY.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.500
IT'S PRIVATE
AND...SACRED NO MORE.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.250
IF I HAVE
TO GIVE UP THIS PLACE,

18:00.250 --> 18:03.250
WHAT WILL I DO
ABOUT MY ROOMMATE,

18:03.250 --> 18:05.959
THE DARK PASSENGER?

18:05.959 --> 18:07.917
THIS APARTMENT
IS THE ONLY THING

18:07.917 --> 18:10.834
THAT'S HELPED ME KEEP
THE MASK IN PLACE.

18:10.834 --> 18:12.583
WITHOUT IT...

18:12.583 --> 18:13.583
I'LL BURST.

18:13.583 --> 18:19.041
[cell phone rings]

18:19.041 --> 18:21.625
- THEY'RE LETTING ME OUT
TOMORROW.

18:21.625 --> 18:23.083
- THAT'S GREAT.

18:23.083 --> 18:25.417
- ANY CHANCE
YOU CAN GIVE ME A RIDE?

18:25.417 --> 18:26.583
- OF COURSE.

18:26.583 --> 18:29.750
- I'M ALSO KIND OF
GONNA NEED A PLACE TO STAY.

18:29.750 --> 18:31.083
I BROKE UP WITH ANTON,

18:31.083 --> 18:32.750
AND, NO, I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

18:32.750 --> 18:35.041
- WE CAN MAKE ROOM FOR YOU.

18:35.041 --> 18:36.959
- RITA WON'T MIND?

18:36.959 --> 18:39.917
- DON'T WORRY, DEB.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.625
- TRINITY'S A LONE WOLF.

18:47.625 --> 18:49.083
UNABLE TO CONNECT.

18:49.083 --> 18:50.709
EXCEPT WITH HIS VICTIMS.

18:50.709 --> 18:53.500
HE NEVER DEVIATES.

18:53.500 --> 18:57.333
BLEEDS OUT A YOUNG FEMALE
IN A BATHTUB,

18:57.333 --> 19:00.625
FORCES A WOMAN
TO JUMP TO HER DEATH,

19:00.625 --> 19:03.208
AND FIVE DAYS LATER

19:03.208 --> 19:05.417
BLUDGEONS AN OLDER MALE.

19:05.417 --> 19:08.417
I'LL LOOK AT POTENTIAL SITES.

19:08.417 --> 19:11.667
THIS MAY BE THE CLOSEST
TO TRINITY I'VE EVER BEEN.

19:11.667 --> 19:14.834
- LUNDY GOT CLOSER
THAN HE THOUGHT.

19:14.834 --> 19:18.125
- HE JUST COULDN'T SEE
HOW ALL THE PIECES INTERLOCK,

19:18.125 --> 19:21.917
WHAT THEY FORM.

19:26.333 --> 19:29.667
A SACRED RITUAL.

19:29.667 --> 19:33.041
- IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO KNOWS
THE IMPORTANCE OF RITUAL,

19:33.041 --> 19:34.834
IT'S YOU.

19:34.834 --> 19:36.166
- LUNDY UNDERESTIMATED

19:36.166 --> 19:37.667
HOW FAR TRINITY WOULD GO

19:37.667 --> 19:39.125
TO MAKE SURE HIS RITUAL

19:39.125 --> 19:40.709
WASN'T INTERRUPTED.

19:40.709 --> 19:43.000
- LUNDY WAS AN OBSTACLE.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.792
- AND TRINITY KILLED HIM.

19:44.792 --> 19:49.709
- IF ANYONE HAS EVER DESERVED
TO BE ON YOUR TABLE,

19:49.709 --> 19:52.041
IT'S THIS SON OF A BITCH.

20:05.417 --> 20:07.458
- CAN I HELP YOU?

20:07.458 --> 20:09.500
- I'M TAKING ON A PROJECT.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.208
- HOW BIG?

20:11.208 --> 20:13.792
- ALMOST MORE
THAN I CAN HANDLE.

20:13.792 --> 20:15.542
AND I DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF TIME.

20:15.542 --> 20:17.041
- MAYBE YOU NEED
ANOTHER HAND OR TWO.

20:17.041 --> 20:18.542
THERE'S PLENTY
OF LABORERS OUT THERE.

20:18.542 --> 20:22.333
- NO, NO.
I WORK ALONE.

20:22.333 --> 20:24.959
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED
THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB.

20:24.959 --> 20:28.125
- SO MUCH WORK.

20:28.125 --> 20:30.542
BUT I HAVE TO FINISH
WHAT I STARTED, RIGHT?

20:30.542 --> 20:32.792
- YEAH, I--I GUESS.

20:32.792 --> 20:36.250
[ominous music]

20:36.250 --> 20:38.208
- WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

20:38.208 --> 20:39.166
- ME?

20:39.166 --> 20:42.208
OH, I'D GO
WITH THE FRAMING HAMMER.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.792
GOT A LOT OF HEFT.

20:43.792 --> 20:45.542
IT'S VERSATILE.

20:45.542 --> 20:50.208
YOU CAN'T GO WRONG.

20:50.208 --> 20:52.291
- I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN.

20:55.709 --> 20:58.792
YOU'VE BEEN VERY HELPFUL.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.959
- LOBBY'S OPEN 24 HOURS.
[tape fast-forwards]

21:26.959 --> 21:28.917
12-STORY BUILDING,
HUNDREDS OF ROOMS.

21:28.917 --> 21:30.542
TRINITY COULD STRIKE ANYWHERE.

21:30.542 --> 21:33.542
HE'LL HAVE TO SET UP SHOP
IN THE SURVEILLANCE ROOM.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.583
TRINITY'S
THE PERFECT PREDATOR--

21:35.583 --> 21:38.625
CAMOUFLAGED, WAITING
FOR HIS VICTIM TO BE ALONE,

21:38.625 --> 21:40.333
AND THEN HE STRIKES.

21:40.333 --> 21:43.667
- TRINITY STRUCK HERE
30 YEARS AGO.

21:43.667 --> 21:46.625
A BARTENDER,
FATHER OF TWO,

21:46.625 --> 21:48.500
WAS FOUND BLUDGEONED TO DEATH

21:48.500 --> 21:50.000
IN THE MEN'S ROOM OF A TAVERN

21:50.000 --> 21:51.709
AT THIS SAME ADDRESS.

21:51.709 --> 21:53.959
IF HISTORY
IS GOING TO REPEAT ITSELF,

21:53.959 --> 21:58.250
THIS IS WHERE TRINITY WILL BE.

21:58.250 --> 22:02.166
- PROBLEM IS, YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHO YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

22:02.166 --> 22:03.750
- LUNDY WAS SO METHODICAL,

22:03.750 --> 22:06.250
HE WOULD HAVE COMMENTED
ON TRINITY'S PHYSICAL APPEARANCE

22:06.250 --> 22:08.333
IF THEIR PATHS
HAD EVER CROSSED,

22:08.333 --> 22:10.291
BUT THERE'S
NOTHING IN HIS TAPES.

22:10.291 --> 22:12.625
I'VE LISTENED TO THEM ALL.

22:12.625 --> 22:14.041
- YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

22:14.041 --> 22:15.500
THAT'S YOUR  RECORDER.

22:15.500 --> 22:19.125
WHERE'S LUNDY'S?

22:19.125 --> 22:20.875
- IT WASN'T IN THE HOTEL,

22:20.875 --> 22:24.250
BECAUSE NDY HAD IT ON HIM.

22:24.250 --> 22:27.000
MUST HAVE BEEN
LOGGED INTO EVIDENCE--SHIT.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
- DEXTER, YOU NEED THAT TAPE.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.625
YOU NEED TO BE CERTAIN

22:29.625 --> 22:30.917
IT'S TRINITY ON YOUR TABLE.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.291
- THERE'S STILL TIME.

22:32.291 --> 22:34.250
HE WON'T COMPLETE THE CYCLE
UNTIL TOMORROW NIGHT.

22:34.250 --> 22:36.083
AND I'LL BE HERE.

22:36.083 --> 22:38.834
WAITING.

22:38.834 --> 22:41.166
- OH, GOD!

22:41.166 --> 22:44.792
OH!

22:44.792 --> 22:47.959
[moans, laughs]

22:59.875 --> 23:01.917
- THAT WAS, UH...

23:01.917 --> 23:03.458
- UNEXPECTED.

23:03.458 --> 23:06.875
- THAT'S NOT AN ADJECTIVE
I USUALLY HEAR.

23:06.875 --> 23:09.834
- I'M NOT COMPLAINING.

23:09.834 --> 23:12.500
I'M JUST--

23:12.500 --> 23:15.041
I'M JUST WONDERING
WHY YOU'RE REALLY HERE.

23:15.041 --> 23:17.875
- MY WAY OF SAYING I APPRECIATE
YOU RUNNING THAT STORY

23:17.875 --> 23:18.875
FOR MY BOSS.

23:18.875 --> 23:20.583
- OKAY. HMM.

23:20.583 --> 23:22.500
YOU FUCKED ME TO THANK ME?

23:22.500 --> 23:23.959
- TECHNICALLY,
I WENT DOWN ON YOU

23:23.959 --> 23:24.709
TO THANK YOU.

23:24.709 --> 23:30.583
[laughter]

23:30.583 --> 23:34.333
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THIS WAS JUST TOO COMPLICATED,

23:34.333 --> 23:38.208
YOU BEING A COP
AND ME BEING A REPORTER.

23:38.208 --> 23:40.625
- I GUESS I LIKE COMPLICATED.

23:44.333 --> 23:47.208
- LOOK WHO'S HERE.

23:47.208 --> 23:48.709
- SORRY, ASTOR.

23:48.709 --> 23:51.083
I PROMISE
IT WON'T BE FOR LONG.

23:51.083 --> 23:52.417
- IT'S OKAY.
I GET CODY'S ROOM.

23:52.417 --> 23:54.500
- SORRY, CODY.

23:54.500 --> 23:57.834
- COME ON, GUYS.
IT'S TIME TO GO TO SCHOOL.

23:57.834 --> 23:59.750
CHECK IN LATER.

24:05.709 --> 24:08.291
[door closes]

24:08.291 --> 24:10.583
- EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT
BETWEEN YOU AND MY BROTHER?

24:10.583 --> 24:13.542
