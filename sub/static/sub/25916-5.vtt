Welcome to your new home, Princess.

00:40.665 --> 00:42.917
You're late. Put these on.

00:44.127 --> 00:46.546
Morning miseries begin at 5:00 a.m.

Oh, man, I'm late for morning prayers!

Come on, hurry up. Hide!

01:22.248 --> 01:23.416
Sorry, Mother Superior.

01:23.500 --> 01:27.670
I didn't get a lot of sleep on account
of my bed being a granite slab.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.799
Granite? Why does she get the good slab?

01:30.882 --> 01:33.009
Princesses always get the best slabs.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.637
Guys, I did not ask for this. Come on.

01:35.720 --> 01:38.640
You throw one little party
and Vikings take over the kingdom.

It's mealtime.

We are praying, Sister Tiabeanie,
that God might see fit to help the poor.

If you want to help them,

I've had Sorcerio work up a special effect

Sorry. I'm done threatening you.

Those are the only two girl things I know.

04:07.372 --> 04:10.959
You're a screwup, too. What about
that tax on yelling that you had?

'Cause I'm banishing you from the castle.

I can't believe he called you a worthless,
bucktoothed degenerate.

I just haven't tried yet.

You know what? This isn't so bad.
No, no, no. This is actually good.

This isn't a window.
This is our trash hole.

We're far too poor for windows.

my pants full over here.

[Elfo] Bean, don't feel bad.
Sometimes being an adult

08:01.647 --> 08:04.650
just means accepting
that things take time. [burps]

Ooh, I would not kiss me right now.

08:07.069 --> 08:08.237
I wouldn't worry about that.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.072
I'll never find a place to fit in.

08:10.156 --> 08:14.076
I'm just gonna crawl back to my dad
'cause I'm a loser who can't keep a job.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.163
Hey, if you're gonna crawl back,
can I ride you like a horse?

All right.

-[Luci] Giddy-up, Bean!
-Whoa, there.

08:22.168 --> 08:25.671
My apprentice has gone missing
under mysterious circumstances,

08:25.755 --> 08:28.424
but instead of looking for him,
I could just hire you.

08:28.508 --> 08:29.675
It's a real time-saver.

08:29.759 --> 08:32.470
I don't know, Stan.
I'm not really good at anything.

08:32.553 --> 08:35.097
Do you like short conversations
with interesting people?

08:35.181 --> 08:36.015
I guess.

08:36.098 --> 08:38.476
Great. I hope you don't mind
wearing a uniform.

08:39.227 --> 08:42.313
Well, we best be heading to work. [laughs]

08:42.396 --> 08:43.981
That's an executioner joke.

08:44.065 --> 08:46.526
You'll hear all of them
in the first 15 minutes,

08:46.609 --> 08:49.195
then it's basically just human tragedy.

08:49.278 --> 08:50.279

I always wanted to be
in the entertainment industry.

You know, in Hell,
I was a communications major.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.878
This is the thumb screw. Whoa-ho!

09:05.962 --> 09:07.672
This is the rack. Whoa!

and this is the book of golf jokes.

09:21.185 --> 09:24.313
my caddy gave me one great
piece of advice. Take up tennis."

09:24.397 --> 09:26.482
No! I beg you!

09:26.566 --> 09:29.277
Since this is your first day,
we'll keep it simple.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.988
Torture this guy a little
then get him his last meal.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.741
Oof. Um, this looks... Yikes.

09:35.825 --> 09:40.454
You know, I'm hungry. Are you hungry?
Let's do the meal part first.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.832
-I could eat.
-Great. What are we having?

09:42.915 --> 09:44.792
It's your last meal. Choice is yours.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.711
Ooh. Uh, stew.

09:46.794 --> 09:49.547
Hmm. No, I had stew yesterday.

09:49.630 --> 09:53.384
-Okay, uh, chicken.
-Fried or roasted?

09:53.467 --> 09:55.511
I was thinking roasted.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.555
Um...

09:57.638 --> 10:01.309
-[stammers] All right, fried?
-I... [sighs]

10:01.392 --> 10:05.396
-Well, what do you want?
-Oh, I don't care. It's your last meal.

10:05.479 --> 10:09.817
Fine, fine. Steak.
I want steak for my last meal. Okay?

10:09.900 --> 10:12.111
-All right. I could do steak.
-[sighs in relief]

10:12.194 --> 10:15.489
Actually, I'm sorry.
That's just so heavy, you know?

10:16.157 --> 10:18.159
You know what? Maybe stew. Stew? [screaming]

10:21.746 --> 10:24.332
-Wow. You're a natural.
-Really?

10:24.415 --> 10:27.168
-Oh, yeah.
-Don't leave me alone with her!

10:27.251 --> 10:28.669
I guess I am.

I've captured the witch who abducted
those people in the woods,

10:44.352 --> 10:46.729
way back to the Hansel and Gretel
cold case.

10:46.812 --> 10:49.440
Good work bringing her in alive
and unharmed.

10:49.523 --> 10:51.901
We'll chop her head off this afternoon.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.112

10:59.116 --> 11:03.537
Everybody have fun at work today.
Alfred, don't suck on your pickax.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.581
Mining makes me nervous.

11:07.625 --> 11:10.252
[exhales] Now it's just me
and the wee ones.

11:10.336 --> 11:14.382
So I'm thinking a little light powdering
and then maybe nap time?

11:14.465 --> 11:17.051
Oh, I've got something special for you.

11:17.134 --> 11:20.638
You do? Aw, that's so nice...
What the hell?

11:21.347 --> 11:25.559
Let's not overdo the baby thing, now.
[slurps] This is made of wood!

11:25.643 --> 11:27.728
[in baby voice]
Baby doesn't like playtime?

11:27.812 --> 11:31.273
Wisten, wady...
[groans] I mean, listen, lady.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.776
It was okay when I was taking things
a little too far.

11:33.859 --> 11:37.530
Aw, baby's cranky.
Baby does need a nap.

11:38.823 --> 11:39.949
[lid slams, locks click]

11:40.032 --> 11:43.202
This is no kinda place
for a grown-ass elf.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.413
So I gotta know,

11:45.496 --> 11:48.541
is that whole flying broom thing
just an old wives' tale?

11:48.624 --> 11:52.128
Like how people expect me
to kiss frogs and talk to birds? [yelps]

11:53.879 --> 11:57.007
Okay, or you're just a crazy old witch.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.593
But maybe that isn't
what you wanted to be.

11:59.677 --> 12:01.429
Plus, there can't be
that many opportunities

12:01.512 --> 12:04.390
for older women who like to cackle.
Is that it?

12:04.473 --> 12:06.434
[cackling]

12:06.517 --> 12:09.061
[sighs] Are you crazy or under a curse?

12:09.145 --> 12:10.855
[cackling]

12:10.938 --> 12:11.981
Maybe both.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.235
-[bones crack]
-Oh! Me back!

12:16.318 --> 12:19.238
Oh, nothing a few days on the rack
won't cure.

12:20.281 --> 12:23.409
Oh, that's the stuff.
[inhales sharply] Oh, yes!

12:23.492 --> 12:24.618
[inhales sharply and moans]

12:24.702 --> 12:27.496
Guess I won't be chopping off
any heads today.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.290
Looks like you got a reprieve.

12:29.373 --> 12:34.003
[Stan] No, looks like you got a promotion.
You're the executioner today.

12:36.422 --> 12:39.592
Oh, wee one,
there's no escape from the fun cage.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.847
-[Elfo grunts]
-Come back, Baby Elfo!

12:44.930 --> 12:47.808
I'm not a baby. I'm a toddler.

12:51.395 --> 12:53.272
[Bunty] Baby Elfo!

12:53.355 --> 12:56.400
Blood ponchos! Get your blood ponchos!

12:56.484 --> 12:59.570
Can't stand in the splash zone
without a blood poncho!

12:59.653 --> 13:03.574
This is all happening so quick.
I'm really nervous. What do I do?

13:03.657 --> 13:06.786
For starters, you should have put on
the black hood before coming out.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.245
Now everyone knows who you are.

13:08.329 --> 13:11.207
[chuckles] Rookie mistake. Oh, dear.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.291
[sighs]

13:13.292 --> 13:16.128
I'm not sure I can do this.
I've never killed anyone before.

13:16.212 --> 13:19.340
-[clears throat]
-Who wasn't trying to kill me first.

13:19.423 --> 13:21.675
Or bother me. Or marry me.

13:21.759 --> 13:24.553
Bean, you're a natural.
And I've seen you torture.

13:24.637 --> 13:28.015
Just think of this as torture,
but with a big, splattery finish.

13:28.098 --> 13:30.976
Now get out there and let's see some gore.

13:31.644 --> 13:35.606
I'll be right here with you, okay?
If you get nervous, just look into my eye.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.942
[screaming]

13:38.025 --> 13:39.777
[laughing]

13:39.860 --> 13:40.778
[gasps]

13:40.861 --> 13:44.406
My little girl.
All grown up and choppin' heads.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.201
And all it took was
some loving banishment.

13:48.452 --> 13:51.080
[babies crying]

13:54.500 --> 13:59.672
[panting] No, not the woods.
People go in there and never come back.

13:59.755 --> 14:02.883
Remember, run between the trees!

14:02.967 --> 14:05.344
[exhales] I'm just gonna lie down.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.769
[herald] And that concludes
the warm-up entertainment.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.939
Let's hear it for Gary the Grabass.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.024
[crowd applauding halfheartedly]

14:22.236 --> 14:24.196
And now, the main event.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.699
Please put your hands together in prayer

14:26.782 --> 14:31.829
for the people-snatching witch!

14:31.912 --> 14:33.914
[crowd hooting and cheering]

14:37.209 --> 14:40.004
[clears throat] Hello? Everybody?

14:40.087 --> 14:42.131
-[man 1] Cut off her head!
-[woman] Come on, kill her!

14:42.214 --> 14:43.299
[man 2] What's the holdup?

14:43.382 --> 14:47.553
This is a goddamn solemn occasion,
so shut the hell up, all right?

14:47.636 --> 14:48.971
[Luci] Take off your shirt!

14:49.054 --> 14:52.141
You guys, have some compassion
and respect here.

14:52.224 --> 14:56.604
This poor woman is nervous.
She's shaking, she's sweating.

14:57.229 --> 14:59.607
This is the first time
she's ever been killed.

14:59.690 --> 15:00.983
Give her a break, okay?

15:01.066 --> 15:03.360
She's talking about herself.

15:03.944 --> 15:07.531
I'm sorry, I guess I have to chop
your head off now.

15:07.615 --> 15:08.991
Do you have any last words?

15:09.074 --> 15:11.869
You could apologize.
Maybe then the king would pardon you.

15:11.952 --> 15:14.538
Don't bother. I can't hear nothin'.

15:14.622 --> 15:16.498
Come on, this is it.

15:16.582 --> 15:19.084
At least give us something
to remember you by.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.252
As long as it's not--

15:20.336 --> 15:22.129
[cackling]

15:22.212 --> 15:23.672
What is wrong with you?

15:23.756 --> 15:25.799
It's like you want me
to chop your head off.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.551
Help a sister out.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.974
Stay sharp, son. It might go foul.

15:41.690 --> 15:46.278
You can do it, Bean. Just use the force.
Centrifugal force.

15:46.362 --> 15:49.615
Hey, choppa, choppa. Swing, choppa.

15:49.698 --> 15:53.369
That's my little girl, everyone.
Murdering that hag.

16:08.634 --> 16:11.261
Daddy, why is she going so slow?

16:11.345 --> 16:14.306
I'm watching the same execution
as you, son. I don't know.

16:19.770 --> 16:20.771
I can't.

16:20.854 --> 16:22.648
[crowd] Aw!

16:22.731 --> 16:25.484
This is the worst field trip ever.

16:25.567 --> 16:29.363
I misspoke, Bean. You know how I said
you were a failure and a quitter?

16:29.446 --> 16:32.533
I forgot one more thing.
You're also a loser.

16:32.616 --> 16:34.076
Make way for the loser.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.704
Coming through. Here she is.

16:36.787 --> 16:40.249
Failure slash quitter slash loser.
The triple-threat.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.543
[laughs] There she goes.

16:42.626 --> 16:46.005
Every time that girl gets
a little responsibility,

16:46.088 --> 16:48.257
somebody winds up alive.

16:54.096 --> 16:57.933
Well, that's it, I guess.
There's no place for me in Dreamland.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.893
I've hit the bottom of the barrel. [sighs]

16:59.977 --> 17:03.188
Move along! You're bad for business.

17:03.272 --> 17:07.151
Maybe I'm just not cut out for the
high-pressure lifestyle of the big city.

17:07.234 --> 17:12.531
It's not for everybody.
Me-flavored water, 15 cents.

17:12.614 --> 17:16.285
Come taste my knees, 15 cents.

17:20.914 --> 17:25.961
I suck. The only thing I'm good at
is sitting on this rock and crying.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.046
[crying]

17:27.129 --> 17:27.963
[gasps]

17:28.047 --> 17:31.550
I ain't no rock
and I've heard better crying.

17:35.304 --> 17:39.308
[moans] Just bury me alive
next to these elf tracks.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.477
-Where do you think he was going?
-Who?

17:41.560 --> 17:44.938
Well, we can add detective
to the list of things you're bad at.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.190
There's only one elf in town.

17:46.273 --> 17:50.569
Oh! Elfo! His tracks lead
right toward that tree.

17:50.652 --> 17:52.112
[Luci sniffing]

17:52.196 --> 17:54.573
It looks like he turned away
at the last second,

17:54.656 --> 17:56.200
then hit this other tree.

17:56.283 --> 18:00.704
Then he cried, kicked that rock,
hopped around in pain,

18:00.788 --> 18:03.082
then stomped angrily down this trail,

18:03.165 --> 18:06.043
where this demented squirrel
stole his shoe.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.003
[snarling]

18:20.432 --> 18:21.433
[Elfo] Whoa.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.273
Hi. Elfo. And you are?

18:28.357 --> 18:30.692
Amused by your wittle twousers.

18:30.776 --> 18:35.155
If you're referring to my nappy,
it's actually war pants.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.825
Well, I should probably
get back to battle.

18:37.908 --> 18:38.992
[yelping and grunting]

18:43.122 --> 18:44.123
Ah!

18:46.166 --> 18:47.751
Mmm. Mmm.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.798
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

18:53.715 --> 18:56.677
-[yells]
-Looks like we have a window licker.

18:56.760 --> 19:01.849
Come, the candy inside tastes much better.
Less bird droppings.

19:01.932 --> 19:04.601
-He's Hansel.
<i>-Und </i>she's Gretel.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.436
So Gretel and Hansel?

19:06.520 --> 19:08.564
[in German] <i>Nein, Hansel und Gretel!</i>

19:08.647 --> 19:09.940
[in English] Please, come in.

19:10.023 --> 19:10.858
[in German] <i>Schnell!</i>

19:17.531 --> 19:19.700
Mmm, wow. Good cocoa.

19:19.783 --> 19:22.327
Yeah, buttery mouthfeel, good viscosity.

19:22.411 --> 19:25.956
Do I detect some kind of mallow?
I wanna say marsh.

19:26.039 --> 19:28.709
Oh, you must have excellent taste.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.878
[both snickering]

19:31.587 --> 19:35.340
Don't give away the game.
When Germans laugh, people get nervous.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.759
Can I do the thing
about having him for dinner?

19:37.843 --> 19:40.053
That's fine.
He's a <i>dummkopf.</i> It doesn't matter.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.471
Let's fatten him up!

19:41.555 --> 19:44.474
He's looking at us,
so I'm going to stop whispering now.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.145
You say you come from the land of candy?

19:48.228 --> 19:53.442
Then you must love peppermint swirlies
<i>und</i> chocolate logs <i>und</i> sugarplums.

19:53.525 --> 19:56.862
<i>Und</i> none of them are dusted
<i>mit</i> sleeping powder.

19:56.945 --> 19:58.030
Mmm. [chuckles]

19:58.113 --> 20:02.409
I'll tell you, if I lived here,
I'd probably eat the whole place.

20:02.492 --> 20:04.786
[chuckles] I don't know
how you stop yourselves.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.206
Oh, we're more meat eaters now.

20:11.210 --> 20:16.924
Oh! All that candy made me so tired.
I'm just gonna lay down in this pan.

20:17.007 --> 20:21.094
He might as well just
pour butter on himself. He is!

20:21.178 --> 20:23.597
I'm confused. Does he want to die?

20:23.680 --> 20:25.265
No, I just don't want to stick.

20:31.813 --> 20:33.440
Hey. Hey, let me out.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.652
I'll show you where me pot o' gold is.

20:36.735 --> 20:39.321
Maybe he is a leprechaun.
He's dancing a jig.

20:39.404 --> 20:40.781
No, he's just boiling.

20:40.864 --> 20:41.698
[Elfo screaming]

20:47.162 --> 20:48.914
Judging from the height
of these tongue marks,

20:48.997 --> 20:51.291
this house has recently
been licked by an elf.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.753
First that little guy, now you two?
[chuckles]

20:54.836 --> 20:56.672
Has anyone else come by here today?

20:56.755 --> 20:59.925
No, no, no. But come in.
Make yourself casserole.

21:00.008 --> 21:01.677
I mean, comfortable.

21:03.679 --> 21:06.265
[sighs] You're just in time for supper.

21:06.807 --> 21:10.519
Do you like ham?
This is like ham, but it's not ham.

21:10.602 --> 21:13.939
How cute. It looks like a little monkey
all roasted up with onions.

21:14.022 --> 21:17.234
<i>Ja.</i> It does, but it's not. Eat.

21:20.612 --> 21:24.032
[swallows] Hmm.
I like this, but as a friend.

21:24.783 --> 21:27.202
Whatever it is, it's delicious.

21:37.713 --> 21:40.507
Oh, my God! [crying]

21:40.590 --> 21:42.968
You served me Elfo?

21:43.051 --> 21:44.469
I thought I didn't like him.

21:45.971 --> 21:50.434
Don't be a dummy bear.
Elf is dessert meat. It's still cooking.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.478
-Ow!
-Help, help!

21:53.562 --> 21:55.063
I'm allergic to apples!

21:55.147 --> 21:58.150
-Elfo! Don't worry, I'll get you--
-[Luci] Bean! <i>Achtung!</i>

21:58.233 --> 22:00.610
Oh. "Make yourself casserole."
Now I get it.

22:01.153 --> 22:04.406
[groans] Never send a princess
to do a demon's job.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.701
[grunting]

22:08.910 --> 22:12.956
God, what did they marinate you in, man?
It smells out of this world.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.008
[muffled grunting]

22:23.091 --> 22:24.593
I'll save you, sister.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.847
[breathing heavily]

22:32.309 --> 22:34.478
[groans] Stop it with the tongues.

22:35.062 --> 22:37.064
The blow pop! It's gonna--

22:40.067 --> 22:41.360
[both giggling]

22:50.077 --> 22:51.286
[both giggling]

22:53.163 --> 22:55.749
[Bean grunts] Caramel strips?

22:56.333 --> 22:57.709
[Hansel and Gretel giggling]

23:03.173 --> 23:04.257
[screaming]

23:09.554 --> 23:10.555
[yells]

23:14.226 --> 23:16.353
[grunting]

23:24.403 --> 23:25.320
[giggling echoes]

23:26.822 --> 23:28.490
[Hansel]<i> This is like ham,</i>

23:29.157 --> 23:30.951
<i>but it's not ham.</i>

23:32.452 --> 23:33.995
[giggling echoes]

23:34.079 --> 23:35.664
Okay, guys? Okay.

23:36.248 --> 23:40.627
All right, the creepy laughter has to stop
before we can have a real conversation.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.838
Guys, give yourselves up.

23:42.921 --> 23:45.215
Everyone will understand
why you went crazy

23:45.298 --> 23:47.426
after the witch imprisoned you
for so many years.

23:47.509 --> 23:49.928
[Gretel] Oh, we were crazy
long before we met the witch.

23:50.011 --> 23:51.805
[Hansel] We ate our parents.

23:51.888 --> 23:53.723
And then the witch kidnapped you?

23:53.807 --> 23:57.519
[Hansel] <i>Nein,</i> she adopted us
<i>und</i> gave us candy, but not enough.

23:57.602 --> 24:00.355
So we tied her to the sink
and started eating people.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.898
Bean! Behind you.

24:03.024 --> 24:06.528
-Bean, kill him. Do not wuss out.
-I don't think I can.

24:08.196 --> 24:13.410
Gretel, no! We were supposed
to grow old together and eat a family.

24:15.537 --> 24:16.955
[Luci growling]

24:20.625 --> 24:22.627
[cackling]

24:23.420 --> 24:28.300
Hey! Whoa. Hey! Whoa. Words!
The curse is lifted.

24:28.383 --> 24:29.843
[laughing]

24:29.926 --> 24:31.344
There's my real laugh.

24:31.970 --> 24:34.723
Bean, look at me.
Don't look at me, look at the corpses.

24:34.806 --> 24:39.519
You did it. You finally killed someone,
intentionally. I am so proud of you.

24:39.603 --> 24:41.146
It was self-defense.

24:41.229 --> 24:45.317
Don't be modest. You killed these
mentally ill siblings fair and square.

24:45.400 --> 24:49.196
And I got roasted alive.
I guess we all did our part.

24:57.787 --> 24:59.956
[Bean] As rewarding as it is
to kill people,

25:00.040 --> 25:04.002
nothing feels better than sparing the life
of one innocent person.

25:09.925 --> 25:14.304
You saved my life
and rid me of that awful curse.

25:14.387 --> 25:16.389
It's been a horrible ordeal.

25:16.473 --> 25:20.810
But my one solace is knowing I can return
to my beautiful candy home.

25:20.894 --> 25:26.983
And spend my remaining years tending
to my twin sister who lives in the attic.

25:29.569 --> 25:33.532
Or, um, you could do something else.
[chuckles]

25:33.615 --> 25:36.201
Traveling is fun, too. Right?

25:36.284 --> 25:39.329
-Bye-bye, now. It was Elfo's fault.
-[crowd gasps]

25:39.412 --> 25:42.749
[herald] And now, the main event!

25:42.832 --> 25:46.127
Princess Tiabeanie, step forward.

25:46.211 --> 25:50.590
For outstanding bravery,
foresight and wisdom,

25:50.674 --> 25:55.345
I hereby award myself this medal
for the extraordinary parenting

25:55.428 --> 25:58.640
that turned you from a worthless,
bucktoothed degenerate

25:59.224 --> 26:03.019
to a ruthless executioner
with a beautiful smile.

26:03.103 --> 26:05.730
-I'm proud of you, Beanie.
-Really?

26:05.814 --> 26:07.399
Not that you care what I think.

26:07.482 --> 26:10.777
Yeah, I'm kinda cool that way.
Thanks, Pops.

26:10.860 --> 26:12.237
Mention my buckteeth again

26:12.320 --> 26:14.906
and I'll use them to bite out
your spinal cord.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.700
[Zog] That's my girl.
