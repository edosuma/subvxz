over the years.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.833
A few.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.838
He grew up on a cattle ranch.

19:32.171 --> 19:35.216
- I knew that.
- It was supposed to be a cattle ranch,

19:35.425 --> 19:37.677
but his grandfather was
a shit businessman.

19:37.886 --> 19:40.346
He was a shit everything.

19:44.935 --> 19:47.854
Do you know your father
never finished high school?

19:49.230 --> 19:50.857
He told me.

19:51.441 --> 19:53.860
- Do you know why?
- Because he was a shitty student.

19:54.069 --> 19:55.570
[chuckles]

19:56.029 --> 19:59.116
Yeah, he was too busy
getting into trouble back then.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.410
But that's not why he didn't graduate.

20:04.788 --> 20:06.581
Why didn't he graduate?

20:07.373 --> 20:08.959
You remember Gram?

20:11.377 --> 20:13.088
Bits and pieces, yeah.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.924
- She wasn't his real mother.
- No, she was his stepmother.

20:16.841 --> 20:19.469
He liked her better than
he liked his father,

20:19.677 --> 20:22.055
which wasn't necessarily saying much.

20:22.263 --> 20:24.099
But one day, I don't know,

20:24.307 --> 20:26.601
it might have been
Memorial Day weekend.

20:26.810 --> 20:29.479
I know there was some
kind of a barbecue.

20:29.687 --> 20:32.523
Anyway, your father was off somewhere,
and when he came back,

20:32.732 --> 20:34.901
he couldn't find his stepmother.

20:35.944 --> 20:38.780
What do you mean, he couldn't
find her? Where was she?

20:40.949 --> 20:43.660
- Why do you wanna hear this?
- Mom, tell the damn story.

20:43.868 --> 20:45.453
Come on.

20:46.496 --> 20:48.623
So he couldn't find her.

20:49.332 --> 20:52.502
He didn't think much of it at first.
Then he went out in the backyard

20:52.669 --> 20:55.546
and your grandfather was standing
at the grill flipping steaks,

20:55.713 --> 20:57.423
and they were all burnt.

20:58.800 --> 21:02.720
Black and charred.

21:02.929 --> 21:06.141
But he just kept sticking them
with that grilling fork

21:06.349 --> 21:08.059
and flipping them over
and over again.

21:08.893 --> 21:10.937
He must've been drunk.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.857
Anyway, that's when Robert knew

21:14.024 --> 21:17.194
that something wasn't right,
and he went back in the house,

21:17.360 --> 21:21.280
and he asked your Uncle Tuck and
Aunt Lynn if they knew where she was.

21:21.489 --> 21:23.241
And they were just little kids then,

21:23.407 --> 21:26.369
and they were too scared
to say anything.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.288
Scared? Why?

21:29.497 --> 21:32.709
Well, he didn't know why.

21:34.711 --> 21:37.172
But then I guess
he heard some kind of...

21:37.839 --> 21:41.843
moaning and crying...

21:42.593 --> 21:46.264
and he realized it was coming
from the cellar.

21:48.307 --> 21:52.812
- The cellar.
- Your grandfather locked her down there.

21:55.857 --> 22:00.778
Your father let her out
and saw that her face was all...

22:02.780 --> 22:04.699
Well, what?

22:06.243 --> 22:09.370
Smashed up.
Her face was all smashed up.

22:09.579 --> 22:12.415
Blood, broken nose.

22:13.708 --> 22:15.960
So, what did he do?
Did he call the police or...?

22:16.586 --> 22:22.175
No, this was rural Texas, late '50s.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.802
And they wouldn't have done anything.

22:25.386 --> 22:29.099
So he went back outside to confront
your grandfather, and they fought.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.310
They went at it.

22:33.144 --> 22:34.437
And what happened?

22:35.021 --> 22:39.817
Your grandfather
cut him with a steak knife.

22:40.735 --> 22:42.612
And your father...

22:43.738 --> 22:45.406
he snapped.

22:46.824 --> 22:50.411
And he grabbed the grilling fork,

22:51.329 --> 22:54.249
and he stuck it in
your grandfather's throat.

22:54.457 --> 22:56.459
[♪♪♪]

22:58.295 --> 23:01.005
He said he almost killed him
right there...

23:02.423 --> 23:04.717
but somehow he stopped himself.

23:06.010 --> 23:07.762
He told me...

23:07.971 --> 23:12.058
he had two little holes in his throat,
like he'd been bit by a rattlesnake.

23:13.559 --> 23:15.937
He used to laugh about that.

23:18.481 --> 23:20.733
Found it funny somehow.

23:24.570 --> 23:27.365
Then he backed off and, uh...

23:28.407 --> 23:31.702
He left, and I don't think
he ever came back home again.

23:34.372 --> 23:36.124
He told me once that...

23:37.792 --> 23:41.462
if he didn't get out of there,
he would have killed the son of a bitch.

23:45.049 --> 23:46.968
That's why he never
finished high school.

23:50.013 --> 23:52.015

- [Sally] The wreath.

26:12.696 --> 26:15.116
- Where's Belle?
- She's not coming.

26:15.325 --> 26:18.244
- Are you serious?
- I didn't want her here.

26:18.661 --> 26:20.371
It was my decision.

26:26.961 --> 26:29.213
- [Danny] Hey.
- Sucks, bro.

26:29.422 --> 26:31.799
Is that all you can say?
He just lost his dad.

26:31.966 --> 26:35.928
[Danny] Don't worry about it. It's okay.
But you guys didn't have to come.

26:36.137 --> 26:37.972
Come on. You kidding?

something else is gained.

26:41.976 --> 26:44.479
I know it sounds like bullshit,
but I believe it.

26:44.687 --> 26:47.315
Yeah. Thanks, Chel. Thank you.

26:47.524 --> 26:50.568
- What are you gonna tell people?
- I'll say she was too upset.

26:50.651 --> 26:53.446
I don't know. I'll say something.
I don't know.

26:55.532 --> 26:57.408
[Sally]
Hey, Belle.

28:03.474 --> 28:05.184
[John]
Thanks.

28:17.947 --> 28:21.534
My father didn't talk much about himself.

28:22.410 --> 28:24.745
He told stories.

28:24.954 --> 28:27.582
Yeah, about being in the Navy...

28:28.249 --> 28:29.708
about the Keys...

28:30.960 --> 28:33.754
what it was like
before the tourism boom.

28:35.005 --> 28:36.840
He told a lot of stories.

28:38.801 --> 28:42.430
But he didn't talk much about himself.

28:43.847 --> 28:46.142
And if you think about that, it--

28:47.017 --> 28:49.186
It says a lot about him.

28:56.277 --> 28:58.904
Christ, this is a lot of pages.

29:02.116 --> 29:04.910
My brother Danny told me
that I should wing this.

29:05.119 --> 29:07.246
And at the time,
I thought it was a bad idea.

29:07.455 --> 29:09.248
[all chuckling]

29:10.124 --> 29:11.750
What the hell.

29:13.836 --> 29:15.379
Look...

29:16.547 --> 29:18.924
to me my dad was a...

29:20.759 --> 29:22.553
He was a god.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.972
Maybe every kid is...

29:25.181 --> 29:27.808
Feels that way about his dad.

29:30.561 --> 29:32.355
But mine...

29:33.939 --> 29:36.693
He actually created a world.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.236
This.

29:40.070 --> 29:42.031
This. Every--

29:42.239 --> 29:44.158
Everything around here...

29:44.867 --> 29:46.785
he created...

29:47.995 --> 29:50.206
out of nothing.

29:51.832 --> 29:56.587
Because when he was 17 years old
and he left home...

29:57.588 --> 30:01.759
because all he had... was nothing.

30:05.929 --> 30:07.724
People ask me, uh...

30:08.391 --> 30:11.894
All the time, they ask me if I'm gonna
take over the family business.

30:12.102 --> 30:14.313
And I think to myself, uh...

30:14.731 --> 30:17.400
you know, what would that be like?

30:17.608 --> 30:19.818
To live like Dad?

30:21.571 --> 30:26.950
Walk onto that porch
and look over my... kingdom.

30:29.953 --> 30:34.083
But I will never know
that feeling or that pride...

30:34.667 --> 30:36.835
because I didn't build it.

30:42.508 --> 30:45.595
He, uh... Heh.

30:45.886 --> 30:48.389
He ruled his kingdom.

30:49.056 --> 30:51.141
He could be tough.

30:53.143 --> 30:55.396
He could be hard.

30:59.525 --> 31:01.527
[♪♪♪]

31:02.403 --> 31:04.781
He had a vision for the family,

31:04.988 --> 31:07.366

31:07.575 --> 31:10.160
what he wanted us to be.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.413
If you didn't--
If you didn't toe that line,

31:12.622 --> 31:15.458
or you didn't live up
to that vision, you, uh...

31:15.666 --> 31:17.794

And how old are you, John?

31:25.384 --> 31:27.595
Well, you know, he, um...

31:28.471 --> 31:32.891
Dad expected the best from us.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.894
Because he wanted the best for us.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.819
Everything that--

31:43.026 --> 31:47.615
Everything that I have, everything
that we all have is because of him.

31:52.161 --> 31:54.664
He made me who I am.

32:03.506 --> 32:06.091
And now my brother Danny, uh,

32:06.300 --> 32:09.136
he'd like to say a few--

32:09.345 --> 32:12.973
Well, I know how he feels.

32:22.817 --> 32:25.110
I know how we all feel.

33:16.746 --> 33:18.330
How's your mother?

33:18.539 --> 33:20.040
I asked you not to come here.

33:20.207 --> 33:22.626
- This is what I'm talking about.
- Here we fucking--

33:22.835 --> 33:24.670
Right here. You see what you're doing?

33:24.879 --> 33:27.840
No, tell me. What'd I do wrong now, huh?

33:28.048 --> 33:29.675
You were the one who left me.

33:29.884 --> 33:32.135
We should be out there with your--

33:32.929 --> 33:33.971
What am I doing?

33:35.347 --> 33:37.516
We should be outside
with your family right now.

33:37.683 --> 33:39.894
And instead you drag me
in here to throw a fit.

33:40.060 --> 33:42.688
- You're acting like a child.
- I'm behaving like myself.

33:42.855 --> 33:46.066
This is me. This is the man you married.
Not Marco. Not John.

33:46.233 --> 33:48.151
Not your father.

33:49.403 --> 33:51.071
What?

33:52.322 --> 33:55.952
- I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry.
- What? What did you say to me?

33:56.159 --> 33:58.454
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

33:58.913 --> 34:00.289

34:00.539 --> 34:02.249
Get out.

- Just-- I mean it. Just get out.
- Kevin, I'm sorry.

34:06.587 --> 34:08.881
- I need to say goodbye to your family.
- Get out.

34:09.047 --> 34:12.217
Get the fuck out of my family's house.

- How's your mother?
- She's not so great.

She would've liked to have been here.

34:23.646 --> 34:26.523
Wouldn't have been fair to you.
She'd be hammered by now, so...

Just like your father.
He always got the pretty one.

34:58.931 --> 35:02.685
Back in the Navy, me and Bobby,
we'd pull into port, head into town.

35:02.893 --> 35:05.145
Five minutes later,
he would be surrounded.

You could not see him
through a fog of skirts.

35:10.359 --> 35:14.030
I can see that. I appreciate you coming.

I'm truly sorry for your loss.
Both of you.

35:16.740 --> 35:17.658

Thank you.

Detective Potts was with the
Sheriff's Department for, what...?

35:21.119 --> 35:25.582
I left in '87, and I understand
you found a badge.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.501
- Yes, sir. I did.
- Hey.

35:27.710 --> 35:30.462
Maybe Detective Potts
can help you with your case.

35:30.671 --> 35:33.966
I'm sure Detective Potts has more to do
than worry about what I'm up to.

35:34.050 --> 35:38.136
Oh... You'd be doing me a favor, please.
He needs to talk to someone.

35:38.345 --> 35:41.640
Well, I don't know why you'd wanna
pick through this old brain,

35:41.849 --> 35:44.351
but buy me a drink, I'm happy to listen.

35:45.895 --> 35:49.106
Well, sure, that'd be great.
I'd appreciate it. Thank you.

I'm sorry. Just sad about Robert.
Listen to me, telling you I'm sad.

35:59.909 --> 36:02.661
- He was your father.
- No, it's okay. Do you need anything?

I'm sorry.

Hey, Meg, is everything okay?

36:38.030 --> 36:39.406
I've been trying to reach you.

36:39.615 --> 36:42.034
I told you I cannot talk to you right now.

36:42.242 --> 36:44.078
I just wanna make sure you're okay.

What the fuck is wrong with you?
I'm at my father's funeral.

36:49.332 --> 36:51.919
I didn't know that. I'm sorry, Meg.

John Wayne or something.

Danny and I to the gun range one time.
