00:17.586 --> 00:18.855
Thanks very much.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.280
Get in the back.

01:18.961 --> 01:22.740
_

02:38.860 --> 02:40.022
Well, well.

02:40.620 --> 02:41.911
God is in the house.

02:42.220 --> 02:45.171
Ronnie. Just the man.

02:46.753 --> 02:48.839
Where's the coppers, then?
Lurking over the hill?

02:49.134 --> 02:50.620
No. It's just me.

02:51.781 --> 02:54.821
I'm on my way up north.
Thought I'd make a stop.

02:55.401 --> 02:57.161
We are blessed.

02:57.187 --> 02:59.078
Before you stole that money,

03:00.126 --> 03:02.166
did it enter your head,
just for a second,

03:02.222 --> 03:04.222
that this is all that Sylvia has?

03:04.955 --> 03:06.250
You look different.

03:07.766 --> 03:10.730
I got it. No dog collar.

03:14.540 --> 03:17.818
Is your house nearby?
Somewhere we can talk?

03:20.380 --> 03:21.555
Yeah, all right.

03:22.662 --> 03:23.862
You asked.

03:31.680 --> 03:34.194
Right, you two,
get that ale in the barn.

03:34.220 --> 03:35.340
Right you are, then.

03:35.369 --> 03:38.339
And leave space for dancing
or there'll be all hell to pay.

03:38.917 --> 03:41.420
Hiya, Ron. Who have we here, then?

03:41.460 --> 03:43.556
Luella, this is Sidney Chambers.

03:43.626 --> 03:44.793
He's a vicar.

03:45.754 --> 03:47.408
Let's just say he's an old friend.

03:47.620 --> 03:49.399
A vicar? That right?

03:50.620 --> 03:53.580
It's a long time since a man of
value's set foot in this place.

03:53.620 --> 03:55.716
Welcome to paradise, Mr Chambers.

04:01.556 --> 04:03.519
Easy with the music tonight, Pal.

04:04.980 --> 04:07.185
Don't want you spooking
my dad's horses now.

04:07.454 --> 04:10.908
One last blast, Marcus. Then
we'll be off your land forever.

04:11.104 --> 04:13.233
I pity them, whoever gets you next.

04:13.259 --> 04:17.060
Now, now. There's whisky in us
already. You know how it gets.

04:17.255 --> 04:18.524
All right.

04:18.660 --> 04:20.459
Come on.

04:25.220 --> 04:26.540
A beach holiday?

04:27.540 --> 04:29.420
You know, hard as I try, Leonard,

04:29.460 --> 04:30.980
I just can't quite picture that.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.140
Oh, yes.

04:32.180 --> 04:34.620
Sidney is never happier than with a...

04:34.839 --> 04:36.839
an ice cream in one hand and...

04:38.076 --> 04:40.043
..the reins of a donkey in another.

04:41.700 --> 04:44.953
Well, I should have lent him
our bucket and spade.

04:44.979 --> 04:46.281
How remiss of me.

04:46.307 --> 04:49.620
I think it's wonderful Sidney's
thrown caution to the wind.

04:49.784 --> 04:51.864
He's treating himself to a holiday.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.500
- One day, eh, Jack?
- One day, Sylvia.

04:55.540 --> 04:56.897
Does it have a name?

04:57.015 --> 04:59.301
This bed and breakfast
establishment, Leonard?

05:00.132 --> 05:01.653
Apologies. No.

05:01.679 --> 05:02.799
Hm.

05:02.825 --> 05:04.821
Off he went, crack of dawn.

05:05.014 --> 05:07.819
Hm. Vanished. In a puff of smoke.

05:11.660 --> 05:13.940
It's no vicarage but it's home.

05:15.404 --> 05:18.510
Right. Let's get you sorted out.

05:24.060 --> 05:25.085
There you go.

05:25.804 --> 05:27.122
It's clean and dry.

05:28.060 --> 05:30.060
Oh, stop being so proud.

05:30.100 --> 05:31.872
Through there.

05:41.940 --> 05:43.745
You did well to track me down.

05:44.100 --> 05:46.780
Friends in the police. It helps.

05:48.540 --> 05:51.260
I had hoped to get to
Lincolnshire by nightfall.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.525
So if you could get me the money?

05:55.660 --> 05:58.980
There's an engagement party here
tonight. Luella and Abraham.

05:59.020 --> 06:01.935
So why don't you stop fussing
and have a drink?

06:02.780 --> 06:04.420
Just the money, Ronnie.

06:05.820 --> 06:08.300
- Then I'll be off.
- What money is that, now?

06:08.340 --> 06:09.928
It's nothing, Pal.

06:11.524 --> 06:15.610
Some pale posh lad turns up at
my camp asking you for cash.

06:15.744 --> 06:17.087
What cash?

06:18.940 --> 06:20.786
I've got some business with Ronnie.

06:22.380 --> 06:23.871
Then I'll be on my way.

06:25.562 --> 06:26.637
Oh, right.

06:28.772 --> 06:31.657
Come on, Pal. Not now.

06:31.980 --> 06:33.865
Not before tonight.

06:45.860 --> 06:48.941
Romanies don't always
take kindly to outsiders.

06:49.780 --> 06:51.557
They hated me when I came here.

06:51.686 --> 06:53.669
_

06:54.531 --> 06:56.336
Some of them would still see me gone.

06:57.940 --> 07:00.399
Ronnie, are you ill?

07:01.380 --> 07:03.020
I'll thank you not to pry.

07:05.900 --> 07:09.881
Look, I'll get you your money.
But in the meantime...

07:10.849 --> 07:12.409
Do you like to dance, Vicar?

07:15.180 --> 07:17.872
"And the gypsy, who knew
the riverside well,

07:17.898 --> 07:19.978
gave him directions which way to go.

07:21.218 --> 07:23.685
And Toad set forth
on his travels again...

07:25.500 --> 07:27.352
..in the best possible spirits."

07:28.237 --> 07:30.517
All right, that's enough for one night.

07:32.420 --> 07:34.140
- Daddy.
- Yes?

07:34.603 --> 07:36.282
Is Mummy going away somewhere?

07:38.100 --> 07:39.260
Mummy?

07:47.606 --> 07:49.174
What are you doing?

07:50.310 --> 07:51.390
Cath?

07:53.940 --> 07:56.060
- I think that's everything.
- Cathy.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.403
There's two clean pairs
of pyjamas in there.

07:58.660 --> 08:00.776
Which should see you
through for some time.

08:04.100 --> 08:05.740
Oh, shaving kit.

08:13.220 --> 08:15.397
Abraham, give us a hand with this.

08:20.012 --> 08:21.832
Shift.

08:24.780 --> 08:26.391
Urgh!

08:31.100 --> 08:32.580
Where the hell have you been?

08:32.822 --> 08:35.491
This is your party, Luella.
Chores to be done.

08:36.620 --> 08:38.294
Just had an errand, Dad.

08:39.303 --> 08:41.700
You've got her running around
all over the place for you.

08:41.740 --> 08:43.580
Things will be different
when we're married.

08:43.620 --> 08:45.500
She'll do as she pleases, I'm sure.

08:45.674 --> 08:47.180
Careful, Ronnie.

08:47.224 --> 08:49.968
Oh-ho! He's having a go at me, Pal.

08:50.241 --> 08:52.001
Really trying, bless his heart.

08:52.820 --> 08:54.740
Calm yourself, Abraham.

08:54.780 --> 08:56.940
Come on, you two, with your jousting.

08:56.980 --> 08:59.059
There's still plenty
to be done, you know.

09:01.060 --> 09:02.820
Could you use this one, Cora?

09:04.260 --> 09:05.860
Luella says he's a vicar.

09:05.900 --> 09:08.300
Probably never got his
hands dirty in his life.

09:08.340 --> 09:11.220
I don't care who he is, son.
He's got muscles, hasn't he?

09:11.260 --> 09:12.700
Plenty of them.

09:16.118 --> 09:17.491
Where do you want me?

09:51.940 --> 09:54.540
You're getting there.
I'm training you well!

10:22.940 --> 10:24.163
We should dance.

10:56.780 --> 10:58.258
You need more drink.

11:02.805 --> 11:04.247
Glad you stayed?

11:07.020 --> 11:09.020
Congratulations on your engagement.

11:09.060 --> 11:11.180
- Thanks.
- How long you been together?

11:11.360 --> 11:12.684
Me and Abraham?

11:15.500 --> 11:18.783
Not too long. Apparently,
we're a match made in heaven.

11:18.809 --> 11:20.237
You don't look too sure.

11:21.580 --> 11:23.788
Soon as we're wed, we're
all moving on from here.

11:24.406 --> 11:26.554
I'll miss it, with all my heart.

11:26.726 --> 11:29.060
Sounds exciting. Moving on.

11:29.620 --> 11:31.665
New place, new life.

11:31.736 --> 11:32.856
You're lucky.

11:33.020 --> 11:36.020
Funny. I think you're the lucky one.

11:37.260 --> 11:40.211
Probably all settled in
your neat, safe world.

11:40.860 --> 11:41.940
- Luella?
- Mm?

11:41.980 --> 11:43.300
You said you'd dance with us.

11:43.340 --> 11:45.178
Yeah. Come on. Have a good night.

11:53.780 --> 11:55.534
Found it on the floor of the caravan.

11:58.020 --> 12:00.879
Why don't you borrow it? You
could do with a lesson or two.

12:01.361 --> 12:04.081
A vicar without a Bible?
Don't seem right.

12:04.348 --> 12:06.548
Oh. This fell out of it.

12:09.220 --> 12:11.020
You're not just here for
the money, are you?

12:12.260 --> 12:13.780
I came here to right a wrong.

12:13.960 --> 12:17.480
Oh! Keep telling yourself that,
you might start to believe it.

12:18.936 --> 12:20.703
Nobody ever admits they're running.

12:24.620 --> 12:27.020
Perhaps we're not so
different, you and I.

12:29.180 --> 12:31.500
Excuse me. I've got a speech to make.

12:39.020 --> 12:42.036
A few words about our darling Luella.

12:42.860 --> 12:45.380
Now, she may not be my
true granddaughter...

12:45.420 --> 12:47.220
No bloodline in sight.

12:47.260 --> 12:49.420
Yet more of a Romany
than you'll ever be, boy.

12:50.980 --> 12:52.660
She may not be my true granddaughter

12:52.700 --> 12:54.900
but she's as precious and
as dear to me as my own.

12:55.556 --> 12:57.500
Since she was seven years old,

12:57.540 --> 13:00.702
I've watched that clever,
funny face grow.

13:01.666 --> 13:04.740
I'd like to wish you all
the best for your marriage

13:04.780 --> 13:08.562
to Abraham, who may,
or may not, deserve you.

13:10.900 --> 13:13.281
- So come on, Cora. A toast.
- A toast.

13:13.658 --> 13:16.395
To my granddaughter, Luella.

13:16.654 --> 13:18.820
To Luella!

13:18.860 --> 13:23.447
And to my beautiful wife
and my beautiful daughters.

13:24.184 --> 13:25.700
- Where are they?
- Come on.

13:25.740 --> 13:27.689
Come on, you two.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.180
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

13:41.680 --> 13:43.720
A thief and a bigamist.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.000
Keep your voice down.

13:50.555 --> 13:52.440
Why? Doesn't Cora know
about your other wife?

13:52.480 --> 13:53.960
Of course she does.

13:55.049 --> 13:56.176
We share everything.

13:56.840 --> 13:59.320
Our life is without
the usual constraints.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.797
Bit like yours, Vicar.

14:03.703 --> 14:05.970
What does Cora see in you, I wonder.

14:06.840 --> 14:09.680
Sidney, you know it would have
killed Sylvia to know the truth.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.560
And she'd never have given me a divorce.

14:12.165 --> 14:14.354
So... I just vanished.

14:14.905 --> 14:16.680
Sometimes it's the only option left.

14:17.840 --> 14:18.960
You know?

14:29.088 --> 14:30.208
Geordie.

14:30.234 --> 14:33.051
It's late, I know.
Sorry, Leonard. Is Sidney in?

14:34.166 --> 14:39.730
Oh. You... haven't heard
about his little... trip away.

14:41.352 --> 14:42.342
No.

14:42.368 --> 14:45.241
It was... a spontaneous decision.

14:45.267 --> 14:47.547
I think he just fancied
a little sea air.

14:49.311 --> 14:51.311
- Sea air?
- Mm-hm.

14:55.402 --> 14:56.824
Has he gone alone?

14:57.195 --> 14:58.881
I believe so.

15:01.120 --> 15:02.240
- Leonard.
- Mm-hm?

15:02.280 --> 15:04.040
I've known Sidney a little while now

15:04.080 --> 15:07.120
and we talk a lot about this and that

15:07.441 --> 15:09.760
but I can safely say his need
for spontaneous sea air

15:09.800 --> 15:11.203
has never featured heavily.

15:11.962 --> 15:14.473
Sometimes people can be unpredictable.

15:15.347 --> 15:16.819
Yes, they can.

15:17.843 --> 15:19.142
Not you, though.

15:20.330 --> 15:22.500
I'm guessing you've
always been an abysmal liar.

15:22.853 --> 15:25.774
- Oh, gracious.
- It's no bad thing.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.640
- Where's he gone?
- Geordie.

15:28.680 --> 15:31.120
I'm going to keep asking,
Leonard. Where's he gone?

15:31.160 --> 15:32.560
- Please...
- Where's he gone?

15:32.600 --> 15:35.000
Please, stop. He left. He just left.

15:38.342 --> 15:42.513
And the timing was... less than ideal.

15:50.349 --> 15:51.469
Where?

15:55.737 --> 15:57.737
He's gone to find Ronnie Maguire.

16:14.633 --> 16:15.697
Luella!

16:16.323 --> 16:17.517
Are you out there?

16:21.981 --> 16:23.141
Luella!

16:30.080 --> 16:31.840
No-ooo!

16:37.438 --> 16:38.558
Christ.

16:41.336 --> 16:42.536
Ronnie?

16:44.029 --> 16:45.426
Get into his wagon now.

16:46.033 --> 16:47.636
You too, Vicar. Help us.

16:48.412 --> 16:51.172
We must keep watch over the body
as soon as life has passed.

16:51.400 --> 16:52.839
Call the police.

16:53.420 --> 16:56.400
We have a police force. It's
the head of the household.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.971
- And that'll be me.
- What's happened?

16:59.280 --> 17:00.600
Where have you been?

17:00.640 --> 17:02.320
Here. I've been here.

17:03.435 --> 17:05.029
Nana?

17:09.319 --> 17:12.640
So, it' s my job to uncover
what's happened here.

17:13.957 --> 17:15.916
It's also my job to punish.

17:16.417 --> 17:18.599
And you came here like no
vicar I've ever known.

17:19.021 --> 17:22.257
Asking Ronnie for money. Now he's dead.

17:28.275 --> 17:31.275
There's nobody here to protect
you now, O, man of God.

17:32.938 --> 17:34.772
They'll come looking for me.

17:35.390 --> 17:37.070
We're good at digging holes.

17:38.880 --> 17:43.320
Or maybe... you found out
tonight why I came here.

17:44.632 --> 17:45.752
What?

17:46.000 --> 17:47.776
Must have been a bit of a shock.

17:48.380 --> 17:50.900
Finding out about Mrs Maguire the first.

17:50.972 --> 17:53.732
Are you saying I killed Ronnie?

17:54.700 --> 17:56.580
I'd say the odds were on.

18:00.666 --> 18:01.973
Stop it!

18:03.000 --> 18:05.040
Please, Pal. Leave him.

18:07.659 --> 18:09.063
Please, Pal.

18:13.724 --> 18:16.998
The money. It's gone.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.560
My darling Ronnie's been
robbed and murdered

18:21.600 --> 18:24.120
and all you can do is beat
each other to a pulp.

18:26.531 --> 18:27.953
Shame on you.

18:49.385 --> 18:51.705
<i>Operator. Which service do you require?</i>

18:51.840 --> 18:52.940
Police.

19:07.770 --> 19:09.170
What were you thinking?

19:09.196 --> 19:12.008
You don't just waltz onto
a Romany site asking for cash.

19:13.594 --> 19:15.765
Geordie, you know what?

19:16.873 --> 19:18.473
Ronnie was dying.

19:19.165 --> 19:20.602
Oh, not that again.

19:21.324 --> 19:23.964
I found something in his
place. A hospital leaflet.

19:24.200 --> 19:26.040
I think he was about to start treatment.

19:26.080 --> 19:29.080
Sidney, there was no record of
any treatment at any hospital.

19:29.120 --> 19:30.520
I saw it. It was there.

19:31.560 --> 19:33.840
What if a man is dead
because I came here?

19:34.898 --> 19:36.138
Why did you come?

19:36.568 --> 19:38.520
To get Mrs M's money, send it back.

19:38.560 --> 19:39.675
And after that?

19:42.050 --> 19:43.570
I didn't have a plan.

19:44.078 --> 19:46.319
I had some idea of Mablethorpe.

19:47.240 --> 19:50.000
There's a little shop. My
first Bible came from there.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.520
A present from my mother,

19:51.560 --> 19:54.080
back when I was filled
with the wonder of God.

19:57.543 --> 19:59.023
Have you and the Lord had a row?

19:59.049 --> 20:01.081
- I don't want to talk about it.
- You could have phoned me.

20:01.107 --> 20:02.630
I would have taken you for a pint.

20:02.802 --> 20:05.402
I think this is going to take
more than a pint.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.970
You have to come home. People need you.

20:09.045 --> 20:11.438
Says the exemplary husband!

20:14.096 --> 20:15.840
Aren't you going to ask
me how Amanda is?

20:15.880 --> 20:16.960
Please, Geordie, don't...

20:17.000 --> 20:18.850
You can't shut her out, Sidney.
It's not fair!

20:18.876 --> 20:20.640
Are you honestly saying that to me?

20:20.680 --> 20:22.453
- All right, we're leaving.
- No!

20:25.537 --> 20:27.537
I saw Leonard's bandages.

20:29.902 --> 20:31.304
Nice timing.

20:31.880 --> 20:33.600
Leaving him to carry your load.

20:33.640 --> 20:35.597
Leonard's stronger than he thinks he is.

20:35.623 --> 20:39.239
- He needs you.
- No. No, he needs a friend.

20:39.800 --> 20:43.000
He doesn't need some
impossible word of God,

20:43.040 --> 20:46.125
telling him how he should live
or who he should marry.

20:46.864 --> 20:48.478
I can't do it, Geordie.

20:48.970 --> 20:52.680
I can't be that...
guiding, shining light,

20:52.720 --> 20:55.498
that bastion of good behaviour,
any more.

20:55.715 --> 20:58.281
For once, I need some time for me.

20:59.733 --> 21:01.636
And wouldn't that be nice?

21:03.142 --> 21:06.571
Bouncing around the countryside
doing what the hell we want.

21:09.783 --> 21:11.369
You're jealous.

21:13.765 --> 21:16.045
Mrs Maguire needs to know about Ronnie.

21:16.671 --> 21:17.871
Come home and tell her.

21:18.906 --> 21:21.160
Oh, no. No, you don't.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.760
- You have to.
- Why?

21:22.800 --> 21:24.280
Because you're the policeman.

21:24.320 --> 21:25.696
You're the bloody vicar.

21:26.523 --> 21:29.427
Thanks for coming, Geordie.
Tell Mrs M for me.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.743
Bye.

21:46.820 --> 21:47.970
Pal?

21:50.007 --> 21:51.820
It's the little ones I feel sorry for.

21:51.860 --> 21:54.111
Free to bury him, fellas, as and when.

21:54.500 --> 21:55.620
All right, then.

21:55.660 --> 21:57.134
A man has just been murdered!

21:58.928 --> 22:01.681
The sergeant was content
it was an accidental fall.

22:03.310 --> 22:05.238
Hold on. What did you just give him?

22:06.862 --> 22:10.222
Oh, me and Sergeant Stokes go way back.

22:10.989 --> 22:13.660
You want him gone because
you're hiding something.

22:14.161 --> 22:15.700
You've got that wrong.

22:16.180 --> 22:19.700
I want him gone because I want
to find and punish the bastard

22:19.740 --> 22:22.296
that killed the love
of my mother's life.

22:28.877 --> 22:30.877
I saw someone with a shotgun.

22:32.077 --> 22:33.677
In the woods, last night.

22:35.190 --> 22:36.688
That was just Marcus.

22:37.087 --> 22:40.069
Landowner's son. Checks
his traps, morning and night.

22:40.512 --> 22:42.266
I saw Abraham too.

22:43.740 --> 22:45.180
Abraham's all right.

22:45.460 --> 22:47.297
He'll take over from me one day.

22:47.323 --> 22:48.875
Would he do it for the money?

23:08.225 --> 23:09.653
He's beautiful.

23:10.592 --> 23:11.872
Yeah, we're getting there.

23:11.983 --> 23:13.324
Been neglected.

23:13.845 --> 23:15.845
Want him gone. Think he's weak.

23:18.220 --> 23:19.719
He looks happy with you.

23:20.265 --> 23:21.657
What do you want?

23:24.540 --> 23:26.340
All this will be yours, will it?

23:27.205 --> 23:28.740
We're Romanies.

23:29.319 --> 23:31.064
We own wagons, not land.

23:32.482 --> 23:34.660
But you and Luella will
be in charge one day.

23:35.044 --> 23:38.054
Yeah, looks that way,
if Pal hands over to me.

23:39.815 --> 23:43.011
I saw you last night,
heading towards the woods.

23:45.541 --> 23:47.381
I think you were seeing things.

23:50.306 --> 23:54.186
Some money went missing,
Ronnie was robbed, then killed.

23:54.300 --> 23:56.060
I wouldn't know anything about that.

23:56.484 --> 23:59.304
Any idea why he'd go back to his
wagon in the middle of a party?

23:59.330 --> 24:01.936
I just saw Cora run back there, crying.

24:02.474 --> 24:04.395
Summat about that first wife of his.

24:06.346 --> 24:07.466
What?

24:07.841 --> 24:10.490
Well, folk heard you and Ronnie
talking at the party.

24:10.820 --> 24:13.332
And word wasn't going to take
long for it to reach her.

24:25.620 --> 24:27.140
What are you burning, Cora?

24:27.180 --> 24:28.669
Ronnie's possessions.

24:29.215 --> 24:30.500
It's what we do.

24:33.460 --> 24:36.980
Here. Nearly went.

24:38.779 --> 24:40.261
Thank you.

24:42.062 --> 24:44.062
Will you come in? Read something.

24:48.024 --> 24:49.980
I'm not best placed to give comfort.

24:50.020 --> 24:51.660
Not at the moment.

24:53.558 --> 24:55.558
No vicar should refuse a widow.

24:57.381 --> 24:59.861
If a vicar is what you are,
Sidney Chambers.

25:03.833 --> 25:06.444
I... I can't read for you, Cora.

25:07.380 --> 25:08.968
Not as God's agent.

25:12.179 --> 25:15.331
Come inside. Please.

25:30.770 --> 25:34.629
You didn't know... about Sylvia.

25:35.301 --> 25:36.502
Word went round.

25:37.542 --> 25:40.606
The vicar brings news
of a living first wife.

25:40.980 --> 25:42.802
He told me you knew.

25:44.683 --> 25:46.213
He told me she was dead.

25:46.486 --> 25:48.880
Is that why you confronted him
last night?

25:50.580 --> 25:52.072
When you found out?

25:53.445 --> 25:55.965
What do you believe happens
to us when we die?

25:56.643 --> 25:58.020
You're avoiding my question.

25:58.602 --> 26:00.225
You're avoiding mine.

26:04.898 --> 26:07.396
I believe in the universe - nature.

26:08.254 --> 26:09.763
It's the only God I know.

26:11.727 --> 26:13.481
Cora, what are you burning?

26:14.228 --> 26:16.153
Please, will you read?

26:17.467 --> 26:19.060
You don't even believe in God.

26:19.281 --> 26:20.380
Ronnie did.

26:20.750 --> 26:22.380
He escaped many things but...

26:22.882 --> 26:24.620
his belief was something
he couldn't shake off,

26:24.660 --> 26:26.187
much as he tried.

26:26.686 --> 26:27.810
Please.

26:29.727 --> 26:30.922
I can't.

26:32.149 --> 26:33.244
Why?

26:34.437 --> 26:37.269
Has he deserted you, that God of yours?

26:39.234 --> 26:41.100
I think I might have deserted him.

26:43.980 --> 26:46.700
Please. I can read with you.

26:46.740 --> 26:47.927
Come on.

26:58.382 --> 26:59.875
"Be strong...

27:02.004 --> 27:03.816
..and of a good courage.

27:04.860 --> 27:07.726
Fear not, nor be afraid of them.

27:09.049 --> 27:10.830
For the Lord, thy God,

27:11.460 --> 27:13.500
He it is that doth go with thee.

27:14.780 --> 27:17.962
He will not fail thee,
nor forsake thee."

27:35.260 --> 27:36.317
Uh...

27:40.963 --> 27:42.963
What's she like, his first wife?

27:44.510 --> 27:45.750
Cora...

27:48.836 --> 27:50.286
It's you, isn't it?

27:52.664 --> 27:54.276
You're the one who's ill.

27:55.660 --> 27:56.731
Cancer.

28:00.275 --> 28:02.100
That's why Ronnie took the money.

28:04.716 --> 28:06.322
To save your life.

28:11.847 --> 28:13.059
How?

28:14.072 --> 28:15.371
Head injury.

28:17.674 --> 28:21.631
Sidney had stopped off there,
hoping to get your money back.

28:25.139 --> 28:26.900
It's sweet. Do drink, Mrs M.

28:32.542 --> 28:34.145
Mrs Maguire...

28:36.380 --> 28:37.580
I don't know how to...

28:40.003 --> 28:41.363
There's no...

28:42.734 --> 28:44.580
There's no easy way of saying this

28:44.620 --> 28:47.175
so I'm going to be
perfectly direct with you.

28:47.980 --> 28:49.580
Ronnie had found love again.

28:49.793 --> 28:52.968
And some years ago,
he decided to get married.

28:54.382 --> 28:57.227
She is from the Romany community.

28:59.159 --> 29:00.448
I'm sorry?

29:03.517 --> 29:09.847
Sidney tells us that they
have two children together.

29:11.873 --> 29:13.540
Bloody hell.

29:15.722 --> 29:17.118
Unbelievable.

29:18.460 --> 29:19.476
Is it?

29:20.641 --> 29:22.249
Well, I wouldn't say so.

29:23.533 --> 29:25.905
One could say it was
entirely in character.

29:29.240 --> 29:31.000
A gypsy, you say?

29:36.701 --> 29:38.954
Do you know where this... place is?

29:38.980 --> 29:40.100
Mrs Maguire...

29:40.140 --> 29:41.481
Do you know?

29:45.359 --> 29:48.060
It's against our tradition
to seek medical help.

29:48.514 --> 29:51.012
Doctors are unclean, they reek of death.

29:52.368 --> 29:55.300
But Ronnie was insistent. He
wanted us to have more time.

29:58.311 --> 29:59.858
Why did you need the money?

30:00.654 --> 30:02.340
You could have been treated
at any hospital.

30:02.942 --> 30:06.340
No address or National Insurance
number. I don't pay my taxes.

30:06.380 --> 30:09.588
I need to have private
treatment or nothing.

30:10.215 --> 30:12.215
Does Pal know about the illness?

30:13.820 --> 30:15.235
Yes.

30:15.754 --> 30:17.269
He's the only one that knows.

30:17.848 --> 30:20.028
And we didn't want to worry
Luella. Not yet.

30:20.054 --> 30:21.610
She has her own war to fight.

30:22.400 --> 30:23.980
What do you mean? With who?

30:24.006 --> 30:26.020
She's not happy about our
move away from here.

30:26.060 --> 30:27.545
She loves this place.

30:28.267 --> 30:30.298
I think she'd do anything to stay here.

30:40.778 --> 30:42.132
Good work.

30:43.020 --> 30:44.389
Thanks, Geordie.

30:46.131 --> 30:47.780
You see, the upside
of being a terrible liar

30:47.820 --> 30:50.220
is you're brilliant
at telling the truth.

30:53.091 --> 30:55.059
I could learn a thing or
two off you, Leonard.

31:04.620 --> 31:05.728
Luella?

31:08.580 --> 31:09.745
What do you want?

31:11.022 --> 31:13.159
- Where is she?
- In the barn. Why?

31:13.185 --> 31:14.745
She's not at the barn.

31:16.033 --> 31:17.740
She wants to stay on this land.

31:18.053 --> 31:19.580
She'd do anything.

31:20.194 --> 31:21.353
What are you saying?

31:21.510 --> 31:22.980
It could have been an accident.

31:23.990 --> 31:25.980
She could have asked Ronnie for money,

31:26.020 --> 31:29.110
he said no, she lashed out.

31:29.820 --> 31:31.400
Careful, Vicar.

31:32.215 --> 31:33.746
We need to find her.

31:38.140 --> 31:41.460
So... here we are again.

31:41.753 --> 31:42.727
Yup.

31:44.159 --> 31:45.911
But we know how it goes, Amanda.

31:46.959 --> 31:49.500
He'll lose his head for a few
days, then he'll be back.

31:49.680 --> 31:52.400
What do we do until then, Geordie?

31:52.922 --> 31:56.353
Just stand here, pouring Martinis strong
enough to blow our heads off and...

31:57.155 --> 31:59.260
wait for his whimsical storm to pass?

31:59.300 --> 32:00.420
No.

32:00.460 --> 32:03.612
The point is, he needed to go
because we couldn't help.

32:03.656 --> 32:04.971
Have you thought about that?

32:05.540 --> 32:08.620
You and I have been rendered useless.

32:08.953 --> 32:11.820
We have absolutely no part
to play in this.

32:12.188 --> 32:14.616
And that is what's really hard.

32:15.357 --> 32:17.477
The moment you realise the
person you love doesn't...

32:19.579 --> 32:20.819
..need you.

32:34.140 --> 32:35.489
Luella!

32:45.813 --> 32:47.973
I packed a piece of apple dumpling cake.

32:48.177 --> 32:50.257
Just in case Sidney's missed a meal.

33:05.260 --> 33:06.780
What are you doing with my girl?

33:06.820 --> 33:09.691
Abraham, no! I am not yours!

33:10.100 --> 33:12.580
I can't be a Romany wife.
It's not what I want.

33:12.620 --> 33:14.326
It... It is so.

33:15.020 --> 33:17.790
Dad! No! Lay off him, please!

33:18.020 --> 33:20.020
I'm going to marry Marcus!

33:29.060 --> 33:30.175
Luella.

33:31.315 --> 33:32.860
What's in your bag? Can I see?

33:33.380 --> 33:35.690
Please... Just not...

33:42.220 --> 33:44.220
- Did you make her do this?
- No!

33:44.620 --> 33:46.060
Ronnie lied for you, didn't he?

33:46.492 --> 33:49.209
He said you were running errands
but you were with Marcus.

33:50.349 --> 33:51.740
Marcus, did you meet her in the woods

33:51.780 --> 33:53.122
on the night of the murder?

33:53.909 --> 33:55.060
Might have done.

33:55.100 --> 33:56.580
Did Ronnie know?

33:57.675 --> 33:59.060
For the love of God, Luella.

33:59.416 --> 34:01.298
Did you kill Ronnie for this money?

34:28.300 --> 34:30.911
- You have Ronnie's money.
- I didn't kill him!

34:30.938 --> 34:33.658
He was the only one I trusted
to tell about me and Marcus!

34:33.684 --> 34:35.164
How could I tell you?

34:36.025 --> 34:37.677
So when did you take it?

34:38.620 --> 34:40.717
I just panicked, OK?

34:42.080 --> 34:44.922
Ronnie was gonna talk to Dad
after the party,

34:44.947 --> 34:46.588
get him to call off the wedding.

34:46.614 --> 34:50.317
He said he had money for me
to run, if Dad didn't see sense.

34:50.446 --> 34:52.715
And then suddenly Ronnie was dead.

34:52.782 --> 34:54.652
And the money was just there.

34:56.940 --> 34:58.100
So I took it.

34:58.995 --> 35:00.282
Jesus!

35:03.860 --> 35:05.084
The money...

35:07.373 --> 35:08.728
You can't keep it.

35:24.551 --> 35:25.942
Mrs Maguire.

35:26.878 --> 35:28.340
Mrs Maguire.

35:33.108 --> 35:35.530
Don't suppose you thought
to iron his shirt.

35:36.330 --> 35:37.883
Doesn't trouble me much.

35:38.770 --> 35:39.982
It troubles me.

35:43.130 --> 35:45.410
I wouldn't have said Ronnie
would choose a woman

35:45.450 --> 35:47.450
with such long and wayward hair.

35:48.187 --> 35:50.907
I always preferred a neat
and functional style.

35:53.009 --> 35:56.206
If it's a war you want, I'm not
interested. I'm too tired.

35:56.395 --> 35:58.075
Too tired?

35:58.889 --> 36:01.537
Ten and a half years, I waited for him.

36:02.330 --> 36:04.566
Ten and a half years!

36:05.410 --> 36:08.130
But he was here, all along.

36:08.170 --> 36:09.290
Here.

36:09.850 --> 36:11.793
In this... pit.

36:13.799 --> 36:15.536
Those poor children.

36:17.090 --> 36:18.690
Born to the wrong mother.

36:18.730 --> 36:21.105
How dare you judge me, lady?

36:23.090 --> 36:25.090
This is how he chose to live.

36:25.930 --> 36:27.168
Get out.

36:28.443 --> 36:29.562
Gladly.

36:29.850 --> 36:33.801
Oh, and my money.
I'll be needing it back.

36:37.432 --> 36:38.516
Geordie?

36:40.344 --> 36:41.981
I'm just here for Mrs Maguire.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.049
That's for you, Sidney.

36:53.741 --> 36:55.609
And you can wipe that smile
off your face.

36:56.562 --> 36:57.890
I'd like to clip you round the ear

36:57.930 --> 36:59.770
for running away and
joining this circus.

37:01.450 --> 37:04.450
But I don't want to reduce
myself in present company.

37:06.170 --> 37:08.370
It was better for everyone that I left.

37:10.608 --> 37:11.982
Like Ronnie.

37:12.294 --> 37:14.734
You are nothing like Ronnie Maguire.

37:14.930 --> 37:17.530
Ronnie ran away from
a marriage that was over.

37:18.490 --> 37:20.290
But you, Sidney Chambers,

37:20.330 --> 37:21.996
just need to grow up.

37:24.051 --> 37:25.632
Come home.

37:27.160 --> 37:29.840
And let's hope the water's hot
at the vicarage.

37:30.239 --> 37:32.239
I rather think you'd benefit.

37:32.637 --> 37:34.643
Nana! Nana, is it true?

37:35.090 --> 37:36.721
About your lungs, is it true?

37:37.130 --> 37:38.250
Yes, my love.

37:40.450 --> 37:41.730
I'm sorry.

37:42.956 --> 37:44.443
You took it?

37:45.204 --> 37:47.081
I was scared and Ronnie understood.

37:47.107 --> 37:50.746
Oh, sweetheart. It's all right.

37:51.530 --> 37:52.930
I'm sorry.

37:59.504 --> 38:02.464
Luella stole the money.
She wanted to get away.

38:02.777 --> 38:03.862
Hm?

38:04.750 --> 38:06.252
There's a lot of it about.

38:10.611 --> 38:13.782
So why kill Ronnie
if it wasn't for the money?

38:15.730 --> 38:18.050
Well, you tell me,
Gypsy bloody Rose Lee.

38:18.090 --> 38:20.553
You're the native here.
You know how their minds work.

38:21.850 --> 38:23.570
You need to work on the wiggle a bit.

38:23.610 --> 38:26.090
Other than that,
it's all quite convincing,

38:26.130 --> 38:28.130
this new identity of yours.

38:31.777 --> 38:33.040
What?

38:33.570 --> 38:35.850
Always trying to be something he's not.

38:37.989 --> 38:39.989
We need to get back to the forge.

38:53.930 --> 38:55.330
Oh, Christ.

38:57.583 --> 38:58.903
Abraham.

39:01.998 --> 39:05.278
You're making a mistake, Abraham.
This isn't who you are.

39:07.170 --> 39:08.690
You didn't mean to do it, did you?

39:08.730 --> 39:10.657
- No, don't. Shh.
- Steady, Sidney.

39:10.683 --> 39:13.673
But Ronnie made you feel
like he was a better Romany,

39:14.748 --> 39:16.290
even if it wasn't in his blood.

39:16.330 --> 39:17.509
No.

39:18.130 --> 39:19.611
And then Luella.

39:19.974 --> 39:21.970
All those errands for a man

39:22.010 --> 39:24.770
who made no secret of
thinking you were weak.

39:25.037 --> 39:27.037
Showing you up in front of Pal.

39:27.530 --> 39:29.971
You knew he was covering for her.

39:31.010 --> 39:33.890
You went to talk to him but
he was arguing with Cora.

39:35.047 --> 39:36.807
You wanted to find out the truth.

39:39.610 --> 39:40.930
Where Luella was going.

39:41.366 --> 39:42.930
But he wouldn't talk to you.

39:42.970 --> 39:44.650
He never took you seriously.

39:47.570 --> 39:49.250
Do you feel at home here, Abraham?

39:49.545 --> 39:50.610
What?

39:50.650 --> 39:54.250
Well, it's one thing for someone
to accuse you of not belonging.

39:54.811 --> 39:57.490
It's another to know it in
your heart that they're right.

40:05.330 --> 40:06.621
The plans were set.

40:07.050 --> 40:09.330
I... I'd take over from Pal.

40:11.250 --> 40:14.016
And run everything,
marry his daughter...

40:16.798 --> 40:18.647
But then Ronnie sniffed you out.

40:20.057 --> 40:21.543
He was right.

40:22.610 --> 40:24.690
I'd never be the big man. I was a runt.

40:25.610 --> 40:27.892
Trying, always trying.

40:28.850 --> 40:30.039
To be this, you know?

40:41.410 --> 40:43.410
If Pal had gone into that wagon,

40:44.927 --> 40:46.517
he would have got the answer.

40:48.359 --> 40:51.935
Me, I can't even manage that.

41:00.810 --> 41:02.947
Sylvia. This is yours.

41:05.341 --> 41:06.754
Your children.

41:07.650 --> 41:10.570
If your illness worsens, is
there anything you might need?

41:11.491 --> 41:14.051
These wagons are my village. My home.

41:14.077 --> 41:15.876
My friends, my family.

41:16.067 --> 41:17.550
They'll hold us dear.

41:19.850 --> 41:21.930
I can see why he needed
to keep you well.

41:22.134 --> 41:23.819
Your children are beautiful.

41:26.040 --> 41:27.331
Take half.

41:30.844 --> 41:32.501
You're a good woman, Sylvia.

41:33.309 --> 41:35.525
You didn't deserve
to be treated like that.

41:44.414 --> 41:45.934
Sidney, you will be careful?

41:46.467 --> 41:49.160
A row with Him upstairs
isn't a row with everyone.

41:52.120 --> 41:55.210
Don't wake up tomorrow and realise
you've chucked out something precious.

41:55.250 --> 41:56.739
Because it will haunt you.

41:58.847 --> 42:00.392
I promise you that.

42:17.330 --> 42:19.010
"The Lord is my shepherd.

42:21.556 --> 42:23.476
I shall not want.

42:24.503 --> 42:27.835
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

42:29.872 --> 42:32.598
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

42:34.090 --> 42:36.250
He restoreth my soul.

42:37.443 --> 42:40.372
He leadeth me in
the paths of righteousness

42:40.543 --> 42:42.142
for His name's sake."

43:24.034 --> 43:26.005
- Are you coming in?
- No.

43:27.430 --> 43:28.910
You look nice.

43:29.364 --> 43:31.124
- Different.
- I have a marriage...

43:32.010 --> 43:34.150
..a family that I need to try and fix.

43:34.176 --> 43:35.896
I need to tell you this.

43:38.884 --> 43:40.809
This wasn't nothing, Margaret.

43:43.342 --> 43:44.918
It's nowhere near nothing.

43:50.556 --> 43:51.843
Goodbye, Geordie.

44:25.953 --> 44:27.254
Amanda.

44:32.250 --> 44:33.770
Can I come in?

44:34.621 --> 44:36.065
Where were you?

44:36.747 --> 44:38.067
I needed some time.

44:38.093 --> 44:40.640
For? To work out
whether you can bear it?

44:41.050 --> 44:42.730
This whole family lark.

44:43.175 --> 44:44.653
And what did you decide?

44:46.572 --> 44:48.572
Cos I... I need to know, Sidney.

44:50.090 --> 44:51.290
Whether I can depend on you

44:51.330 --> 44:53.068
or whether I'm raising my child alone.

44:55.530 --> 45:00.904
Amanda, please. It's...
not simple... or clear.

45:00.930 --> 45:03.250
All right, well, let's
make it really simple

45:03.290 --> 45:04.850
and really clear, then, shall we?

45:04.890 --> 45:06.150
It's me...

45:08.329 --> 45:09.649
..or the Church.

45:11.196 --> 45:12.209
Easy.
