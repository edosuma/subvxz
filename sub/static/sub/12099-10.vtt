Yes. What?

00:50.984 --> 00:54.853
Jodie, I can't hear you.
Speak slowly.

00:54.854 --> 00:56.322
It's a bad connection.

00:57.824 --> 00:59.324
Did you find her?

Oh.

Did you wear a warm jacket?

01:39.632 --> 01:42.468
I'm not being a mother.
You're in Alaska.

It's very cold there.
Besides, I'm your mother.

Oh, it's easy for you to say.

02:27.847 --> 02:30.349
Men don't gain weight
like women do.

02:30.350 --> 02:32.351
And if they do,
they lose it faster.

02:32.352 --> 02:34.353
Men burn up twice
as many calories

02:34.354 --> 02:36.855
as women doing
the exact same thing.

it was Jodie.

to do that.

I see those stands,

to knock off my entire family.
