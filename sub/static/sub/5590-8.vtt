Well, he seemed
a little quiet. Why?

He's been kind of...Cagey
all week --

since he and kevin split up.

someone else.

How does sony even know
that they want to sign her?

26:11.845 --> 26:15.012
And deal with some of this --
if you don't mind.

26:15.014 --> 26:18.148
Yeah. No, no, no.
Of course. Yeah. Go.

26:18.150 --> 26:19.782
Thanks for today.

26:19.784 --> 26:21.350
It was my pleasure.

26:22.886 --> 26:24.018
See you tomorrow.

26:24.020 --> 26:25.752
Okay. Good night.

26:28.523 --> 26:30.656
Yeah, and now
sony music wants me.

26:30.658 --> 26:32.357
My mom said no.
[ scoffs ]

26:32.359 --> 26:34.058
Seriously,
she's the worst.

26:35.728 --> 26:37.894
Okay, talia.
Sorry. I have to go.

26:37.896 --> 26:39.795
I'll call you later.

26:39.797 --> 26:41.296
Here's your stupid phone
back.

26:41.298 --> 26:43.298
Don't go telling mom.

26:43.300 --> 26:44.666
You were offered
a record deal?

26:44.668 --> 26:45.700
Yeah, I guess
someone saw the video

26:45.702 --> 26:47.334
Of me
singing with juliette.

26:47.336 --> 26:49.235
I mean,
not that it even matters.

26:49.237 --> 26:51.637
Mom's not gonna let me sign
to a label, like, ever, so...

26:51.639 --> 26:53.205
But they only wanted<i> you.</i>

26:54.074 --> 26:56.707
Look...

26:56.709 --> 26:59.076
We're in different places
right now.

26:59.078 --> 27:00.210
I'm grown up.

27:00.212 --> 27:03.379
I'm ready for things
that you're not yet.

27:03.381 --> 27:05.481
Just say it.

27:05.483 --> 27:07.382
You don't need me.

27:07.384 --> 27:09.317
Nobody needs me.

27:09.319 --> 27:10.885
Come on.
I didn't say that.

27:10.887 --> 27:12.853
[ footsteps departing ]

27:12.855 --> 27:13.987
[ sighs ]

27:16.358 --> 27:19.726
Frankie: Pretty sure we hired
professionals to do that.

27:19.728 --> 27:22.195
I'm just trying to keep
the progress going, you know?

27:22.197 --> 27:24.096
Anything
you want to talk about?

27:24.098 --> 27:25.997
[ breathing heavily ]
like what?

27:25.999 --> 27:27.732
Like you're down here
punching holes in walls

27:27.734 --> 27:29.900
When you ought to be
at home.

27:29.902 --> 27:31.067
Everything okay there?

27:31.069 --> 27:33.702
Yeah, frankie.
Everything's fine.

27:33.704 --> 27:35.670
Really?

27:35.672 --> 27:37.438
Yeah. Really.
'cause from what I can tell,

27:37.440 --> 27:39.406
You're starting to go
a little dry-drunk on me here.

27:41.109 --> 27:42.675
All right, look,
first of all,

27:42.677 --> 27:45.010
You're not my sponsor
anymore, okay?

27:45.012 --> 27:48.346
That's one. Number two --
you're way off base here.

27:48.348 --> 27:50.081
I'm just trying
to keep us on schedule.

27:50.083 --> 27:52.283
If you don't mind,
I'd like to get back to it.

27:52.285 --> 27:54.118
Well, you don't need to be
doing it all by yourself.

27:54.120 --> 27:55.752
Yeah, well, maybe I<i> want</i> to,
frankie, all right?

27:56.955 --> 27:58.621
Deacon, hey!

27:58.623 --> 28:00.189
You hit that crossbeam
one more time,

28:00.191 --> 28:01.356
And the ceiling's
coming down.

28:01.358 --> 28:03.024
[ breathing heavily ]

28:15.972 --> 28:18.305
I guess I can't do nothing right
these days, huh?

28:21.743 --> 28:24.310
Wow.
Great save out there.

28:24.312 --> 28:25.911
The crowd really loved
the acoustic number.

28:25.913 --> 28:28.213
Oh, good. It's not really
a part of the usual set.

28:28.215 --> 28:29.981
Did you find out
what happened?

28:29.983 --> 28:32.984
Yeah, house manager said erin
overcompensated on the monitors

28:32.986 --> 28:35.152
Without balancing the outputs,
blew the fuses.

28:35.154 --> 28:38.054
So much for hiring
a capable sound tech.
Uh-huh.

28:38.056 --> 28:39.922
I don't want to deal with this,
but gunnar probably won't.

28:39.924 --> 28:41.123
Erin:
Hey, it's not my fault

28:41.125 --> 28:42.657
This place has
a weak electrical grid.

28:42.659 --> 28:43.958
That is not the problem,
okay?

28:43.960 --> 28:45.225
I did sound
at the bluebird,

28:45.227 --> 28:47.060
And you pushed the sound board
too far.

28:47.062 --> 28:48.327
Did you see
that crappy old board?

28:48.329 --> 28:49.828
No, but I saw<i> you,</i>

28:49.830 --> 28:52.463
And you had no idea
how to handle the situation.

28:52.465 --> 28:53.564
I mean, I don't get it.

28:53.566 --> 28:55.232
You toured
with juliette barnes.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.968
Yeah, and I've shadowed
plenty of big-sound setups.

28:57.970 --> 29:00.303
But maybe I don't have
quite as much experience

29:00.305 --> 29:02.171
Running a whole show
by myself, all right?

29:02.173 --> 29:03.672
I vouched for you

29:03.674 --> 29:04.906
Because I thought
you knew what you were doing.

29:04.908 --> 29:07.642
And now I look like an idiot
who's brought his --

29:07.644 --> 29:09.343
Whatever this is on the road
for the wrong reasons.

29:09.345 --> 29:10.644
Look, gunnar, I know --

29:10.646 --> 29:12.078
Let me be really clear
with you.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.179
If you can't do the job,

29:13.181 --> 29:14.647
You need to get
the hell off my tour.

29:23.157 --> 29:24.990
Deacon: Oh, hey.

29:24.992 --> 29:26.925
I wasn't even sure
you'd be home.

29:26.927 --> 29:28.860
Thought you'd still be
at the studio, maybe.

29:28.862 --> 29:29.927
[ exhales deeply ]

29:29.929 --> 29:30.894
Where you been?

29:32.364 --> 29:33.830
At the bar all day.

29:33.832 --> 29:35.765
We had this whole situation
with maddie.

29:35.767 --> 29:37.933
I needed your help.
I need your support.

29:37.935 --> 29:40.435
All I got was,
"well, whatever you decide."

29:40.437 --> 29:42.203
I mean, come on, rayna.
You know what maddie needs.

29:42.205 --> 29:44.004
I don't have any idea
what she --
neither do I.

29:44.006 --> 29:45.171
Only thing I know
right now

29:45.173 --> 29:48.140
Is that maddie is
at a crossroads,

29:48.142 --> 29:50.375
And I am really worried
that we're gonna lose her.

29:50.377 --> 29:51.542
Well, yeah, I get that,

29:51.544 --> 29:52.809
But I don't know
what I'm supposed to do

29:52.811 --> 29:54.043
When she won't even
talk to me, all right?

29:54.045 --> 29:55.294
She barely wants
to<i> look</i> at me, rayna.

29:55.295 --> 29:56.544
Of course she won't talk to you.
She's a teenager.

29:56.547 --> 29:58.113
She's not gonna
talk to<i> me,</i> either.

29:58.115 --> 29:59.547
No, it's not just that. There's
more than that, all right?

29:59.549 --> 30:01.515
I'm telling you -- I don't know
what the hell I did,

30:01.517 --> 30:03.049
But it's different.
It's all --
doesn't matter.

30:03.051 --> 30:04.283
None of that matters.

30:04.285 --> 30:07.719
Only thing that matters
is she needs us desperately.

30:10.190 --> 30:11.622
And I need you, babe.

30:12.958 --> 30:15.124
I need you as a partner
and -- and co-parent.

30:15.126 --> 30:16.358
I mean, isn't that
what we're doing?

30:16.360 --> 30:18.193
Isn't that
what we fought so hard for?

30:21.364 --> 30:22.563
Yeah.

30:23.832 --> 30:25.198
You're right.

30:27.335 --> 30:28.901
That's right.
I'm here.

30:31.372 --> 30:33.338
We just got to be
a united front, babe --

30:33.340 --> 30:35.573
On everything.

30:35.575 --> 30:38.975
Whether it's buying a bar
or raising our kids.

30:38.977 --> 30:40.009
I want to.

30:40.011 --> 30:41.276
I just...

30:43.413 --> 30:45.212
I'm scared to death
I'm gonna do it wrong.

30:45.214 --> 30:47.581
Yeah, well, we just got to do it
the best we can.

30:47.583 --> 30:49.215
All right.

30:49.217 --> 30:52.518
[ sighs deeply ]

30:52.520 --> 30:53.585
What do you want to do
about maddie?

30:53.587 --> 30:56.321
I think
I have an idea.

30:56.323 --> 30:58.156
But I want
to run it past you first.

31:02.428 --> 31:04.261
Hey, I, uh, saw you

31:04.263 --> 31:06.496
Handling things with erin
just before.

31:06.498 --> 31:07.763
I was kind of surprised
you did that.

31:07.765 --> 31:09.498
Of course I handled it.
You know what?

31:09.500 --> 31:10.765
I'm getting pretty tired
of you acting like

31:10.767 --> 31:12.166
I'm not taking this tour
seriously.

31:12.168 --> 31:14.034
Just chill out.
I'm trying to thank you.

31:14.036 --> 31:16.202
Oh. Well...

31:16.204 --> 31:17.436
You're welcome.

31:18.872 --> 31:20.872
I know I've been cranky.

31:20.874 --> 31:23.174
Being away from caleb is harder
than I thought it would be,

31:23.176 --> 31:26.343
But, uh, I'm sorry if any
of that's coming off on you.

31:26.345 --> 31:28.111
Well, I get it.

31:28.113 --> 31:31.547
I can see how you'd think
I've been distracted by erin,

31:31.549 --> 31:34.216
But honestly,
I'm just having fun.

31:34.218 --> 31:35.884
Although,
after what just happened,

31:35.886 --> 31:37.886
I doubt there'll be
much more of that.

31:37.888 --> 31:39.053
Well, at least we know

31:39.055 --> 31:40.521
We can rely on each other
musically.

31:42.725 --> 31:45.726
It was pretty cool tonight,
all those cellphones.

31:45.728 --> 31:48.228
I think I actually prefer
the acoustic version.

31:48.230 --> 31:49.229
[ chuckles ]

31:49.231 --> 31:50.363
Yeah.

31:55.803 --> 31:57.469
Hey.

31:57.471 --> 31:59.370
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

31:59.372 --> 32:00.971
[ tv shuts off ]

32:03.208 --> 32:06.042
I realize, uh,
you and me are still, uh,

32:06.044 --> 32:09.812
Figuring out our issues,
but, uh, I want you to know

32:09.814 --> 32:12.781
I'll always be honest
with you -- straight up.

32:12.783 --> 32:16.117
Which is why
I'm telling you that, um...

32:16.119 --> 32:18.552
Me and gabriella...

32:18.554 --> 32:19.886
We're together.

32:19.888 --> 32:21.888
We're, uh, starting
a relationship,

32:21.890 --> 32:23.756
And I just wanted to be up front
with you about it.

32:23.758 --> 32:26.125
Obviously.

32:26.127 --> 32:28.694
You were with her the night
jeff died, weren't you?

32:32.265 --> 32:33.897
Yeah, son, I was.

32:35.233 --> 32:37.199
Is that all?

32:40.304 --> 32:42.704
[ tv turns on ]

32:44.741 --> 32:46.774
[ exhales sharply ]
hey, would you relax?

32:46.776 --> 32:48.909
This is the bluebird.
It's a safe place.

32:48.911 --> 32:50.277
Yeah, well,
you neglected to tell me

32:50.279 --> 32:51.611
That it's
songwriter's night,

32:51.613 --> 32:53.346
Which means there's
actual songwriters in there,

32:53.348 --> 32:54.513
Not just amateurs,
like me.

32:54.515 --> 32:55.947
Nobody has to know
you wrote it.

32:55.949 --> 32:57.782
It's still<i> my</i> words
about<i> my</i> breakup.

32:57.784 --> 32:59.483
It's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be weird.

32:59.485 --> 33:01.351
You're completely
overreacting.

Thank you so much.

33:08.791 --> 33:10.190
I can't do this.

33:10.192 --> 33:11.591
Will, wait!

33:11.593 --> 33:12.992
Come on.

33:14.695 --> 33:16.361
Really?

Hi, everybody.
Thanks for having me.

I finally found a way ¶

35:40.649 --> 35:42.148
Why do we need to have
a family meeting?

35:42.150 --> 35:43.749
Is this about my hair? Because
I'm not changing it back.

35:43.751 --> 35:45.717
It's not
about your hair.

35:45.719 --> 35:47.752
Can you scooch over,
please?

35:47.754 --> 35:48.986
Closer
to your sister?

35:53.892 --> 35:58.060
Well, we did want
to talk to you because...

35:58.062 --> 36:02.797
There's been a lot happening,
and...We need to sit down

36:02.799 --> 36:05.099
And have a discussion
as a family.

Deacon:
All of us been going through
some tough times here.

36:07.403 --> 36:08.668
It's a lot.
It's a whole lot.

36:08.670 --> 36:11.303
But that's why, you know,
we're here together --

36:11.305 --> 36:13.405
To help each other
through these things.

36:13.407 --> 36:15.140
And that includes
what's been going on

36:15.142 --> 36:16.741
Between
the two of you.

36:16.743 --> 36:19.944
Now, maddie, we understand
that you're a teenager now

36:19.946 --> 36:21.979
And -- and you're feeling
more mature

36:21.981 --> 36:24.414
And you want
to express yourself.

36:24.416 --> 36:26.749
And we've got to find
the right way to do that.

36:26.751 --> 36:27.750
And, sweetheart,
you're going through

36:27.752 --> 36:29.251
A lot of changes, too.

36:29.253 --> 36:32.821
You might feel like
you're being left out sometimes.

36:32.823 --> 36:34.823
We don't want you
to feel like that.

36:34.825 --> 36:37.692
We're a family here now --
all of us, all right?

36:37.694 --> 36:40.528
I just want you
to know that...

36:40.530 --> 36:42.963
We both love you so much --
both of you.

36:42.965 --> 36:44.197
And we want to support

36:44.199 --> 36:45.665
The things
that are important to you,

36:45.667 --> 36:48.534
But we want to do that
in the right way.

36:48.536 --> 36:51.103
So, we talked about it
together

36:51.105 --> 36:53.672
And decided
it might be time

36:53.674 --> 36:55.974
For y'all to sign
at highway 65.

36:55.976 --> 36:57.342
Stop.

36:57.344 --> 36:58.876
Wait, seriously?
Are --

36:58.878 --> 37:00.277
[ chuckling ]
yes, seriously.

37:00.279 --> 37:03.146
Rayna: On my label
with one condition --

37:03.148 --> 37:06.516
That you do it together
as a team.

37:06.518 --> 37:07.517
Think y'all
can agree to that?

37:14.558 --> 37:16.391
[ sighs ]

37:16.393 --> 37:20.794
I'm embarrassed to even ask,
but, uh...How'd it go?

37:20.796 --> 37:23.163
Good.

37:23.165 --> 37:25.398
It was great,
actually.

37:25.400 --> 37:27.566
Turns out all that personal
heartache of yours

37:27.568 --> 37:29.301
Is pretty universal.

37:29.303 --> 37:33.404
But your writing,
the way you tapped into it

37:33.406 --> 37:36.340
And made everything there
feel something --

37:36.342 --> 37:37.607
Even me.

37:40.845 --> 37:43.912
Well...

37:43.914 --> 37:46.347
Thank you for doing that for me.
I appreciate it.

37:46.349 --> 37:47.981
It was my pleasure.

37:47.983 --> 37:50.817
It's been a long time
since I've been on a stage.

37:50.819 --> 37:53.152
Almost forgot what playing
real music feels like.

37:53.154 --> 37:54.586
[ chuckles ]

37:54.588 --> 37:56.921
Oh.
Before I forget.

37:56.923 --> 37:59.924
There was a publisher
in the audience tonight --

37:59.926 --> 38:01.992
Said whoever wrote that song
should give him a call.

38:03.228 --> 38:06.462
That's not bad
for a first-time songwriter.

38:10.100 --> 38:11.265
[ sighs ]

38:13.936 --> 38:15.735
That went better
than expected, didn't it?

38:15.737 --> 38:18.037
They didn't see it coming.
That's for sure.

38:18.039 --> 38:20.072
Especially daphne.
[ chuckles ]

38:20.074 --> 38:21.506
[ chuckling ] yeah.

38:21.508 --> 38:23.875
We're doing the right thing,
signing her, right?

38:23.877 --> 38:25.109
Yeah.

38:25.111 --> 38:27.411
I think so.

38:27.413 --> 38:28.845
I'm just sorry
I wasn't here

38:28.847 --> 38:30.613
To help you
come up with the right thing.

38:31.916 --> 38:35.517
Tell you what --
that's not gonna happen again.

38:35.519 --> 38:37.919
From now on, I'm here for you,
and I'm here for the girls.

38:37.921 --> 38:40.454
Thank you.

38:40.456 --> 38:42.622
Right now, I just want you
here for<i> me.</i>

38:42.624 --> 38:44.023
[ chuckles ]

38:49.430 --> 38:52.264
Oh, my god!
We have a record deal!

38:52.266 --> 38:54.966
Maddie,
we're recording artists!

38:54.968 --> 38:56.534
Why aren't you excited?

38:56.536 --> 38:59.236
You know
why mom did that, right?

38:59.238 --> 39:01.238
The only reason
she signed us at all

39:01.240 --> 39:02.639
Is to keep me
under her control.

39:04.142 --> 39:05.708
[ knock on door ]

39:08.646 --> 39:10.412
Hey.

39:10.414 --> 39:12.580
I wanted to apologize
for tonight.

39:12.582 --> 39:13.981
It was my bad,
and I should have been

39:13.983 --> 39:16.116
More up front
about my experience.

39:16.118 --> 39:17.951
Look, you got good instincts,
all right?

39:17.953 --> 39:21.054
But some of these smaller venues
are tricky.

39:21.056 --> 39:23.089
It's not all
top-of-the-line sound systems,

39:23.091 --> 39:24.323
Like you dealt with
on the big tours.

39:24.325 --> 39:25.624
I know.

39:25.626 --> 39:27.425
I want to learn
how to work them all,

39:27.427 --> 39:30.327
And I really want
to stay on the tour.

39:31.997 --> 39:33.930
So I was hoping
maybe you'd share

39:33.932 --> 39:35.398
Any tips you may have.
[ chuckles ]

39:35.400 --> 39:37.466
Of course.

39:37.468 --> 39:38.900
All you had to do
was ask.

39:38.902 --> 39:40.301
Thanks.

39:42.672 --> 39:44.972
Good night.
[ chuckles nervously ]

39:44.974 --> 39:46.406
That's it?

39:47.942 --> 39:50.575
You want to stay on the tour
for professional reasons?

39:55.280 --> 39:58.513
I can think of a few
personal reasons, as well.

40:01.284 --> 40:02.716
[ chuckles ]

40:05.821 --> 40:08.655
[ ringing ]

40:08.657 --> 40:10.089
Caleb: Scarlett?

40:10.091 --> 40:12.257
Hi.
Did I wake you?

40:12.259 --> 40:13.391
That's okay.
What's up?

40:14.827 --> 40:18.328
This is not easy for me --
you know, being away.

40:18.330 --> 40:20.096
I know.
I'm sorry.

40:20.098 --> 40:24.032
I shouldn't have questioned
your priorities.

40:24.034 --> 40:25.500
It was uncalled for.

40:25.502 --> 40:26.934
Thank you.

40:28.938 --> 40:33.040
You're sort of right.
This tour does mean a lot to me.

40:33.042 --> 40:35.275
It's showed me how much
I've grown as an artist...

40:35.277 --> 40:36.943
And a person.

40:38.780 --> 40:41.881
It's also showed me
how much I need you.

40:41.883 --> 40:43.382
I need us.

40:43.384 --> 40:45.684
This tour will be over
before you know it,

40:45.686 --> 40:49.187
So we just got to
do our best until then.

40:49.189 --> 40:51.222
[ chuckles ] speaking of which,
I wish you'd been there tonight.

40:51.224 --> 40:52.556
It was really something.

40:52.558 --> 40:54.991
Yeah, actually,
I have an early morning,

40:54.993 --> 40:57.159
So I really should
get some sleep.

40:57.161 --> 40:58.460
Can we talk tomorrow?

40:58.462 --> 41:00.495
Oh, yeah. Sure.

41:00.497 --> 41:02.530
You, uh,
you sleep well.

41:02.532 --> 41:03.898
I love you.

41:03.900 --> 41:05.132
Thanks.
I love you, too.

41:05.134 --> 41:06.333
Good night.

41:06.335 --> 41:08.435
[ cellphone clicks ]

41:12.240 --> 41:14.540
[ gunnar and erin moaning ]

41:14.542 --> 41:16.074
[ thumping ]

41:22.081 --> 41:24.114
[ both breathing heavily ]

41:26.885 --> 41:29.352
Well...

41:29.354 --> 41:31.220
We definitely got to make
more time for that.

41:31.222 --> 41:32.721
I think you need
to make more time

41:32.723 --> 41:34.556
For that manual labor
at the bar.

41:34.558 --> 41:36.357
It's doing wonders
for your biceps.

41:36.359 --> 41:38.459
[ both laugh ]

41:41.564 --> 41:43.564
You know,
I hate to tell you,

41:43.566 --> 41:45.399
[chuckling] but I think
my construction days are over.

41:45.401 --> 41:47.434
Oh, no!

41:47.436 --> 41:49.269
Mm.

41:49.271 --> 41:51.004
Mm.

41:51.006 --> 41:52.839
I'm gonna
go take a shower.

41:52.841 --> 41:54.440
Okay.

41:56.677 --> 41:58.743
[ sighs ]

41:58.745 --> 42:00.978
Feel free
to come join me.

42:05.717 --> 42:07.416
[ cellphone chimes ]

42:09.086 --> 42:11.286
[ water running ]
