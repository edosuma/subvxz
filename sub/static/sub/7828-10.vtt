00:32.421 --> 00:33.999
We now return to the 1971 film...

00:35.424 --> 00:38.460
...Goodtime Slim, Uncle Doobie,
and the Great Frisco FreakOut...

00:38.636 --> 00:40.130
...starring Troy McClure.

00:43.390 --> 00:46.142
Slim, if we've got the bag
with the stolen diamonds...

00:46.310 --> 00:48.635
...then what happened to the bag
with our stash?

00:48.812 --> 00:51.220
There's more than one way
to get high, baby.

01:00.532 --> 01:03.368
Please, Marge. How often
can I see a movie of this caliber...

01:03.535 --> 01:06.240
...on late night TV?
- Is there something wrong, Homie?

01:06.455 --> 01:08.863
It's just that I've only seen this
twice before...

01:09.410 --> 01:11.662
...and I've seen you every night
for the last 11 ye...

01:11.835 --> 01:14.540
What I meant to say is,
we'll snuggle tomorrow, sweetie.

01:14.713 --> 01:16.172
I promise.

01:22.888 --> 01:24.762
Enchiladas.

01:32.648 --> 01:33.763
Mom! Dad!

01:33.983 --> 01:35.940
Don't turn on the light!

01:36.151 --> 01:39.188
There's a UFO outside my window.
Seriously.

01:39.405 --> 01:43.189
Oh, Bart, it's just an old golf umbrella
stuck in a tree.

01:44.660 --> 01:47.412
Can I sleep in there
with you guys tonight?

01:47.621 --> 01:48.996
- No.
- Can I sit on the roof...

01:49.164 --> 01:50.872
...with a baseball bat
in case a UFO comes?

01:51.830 --> 01:52.625
Yes, that's fine. Good, good.

01:55.838 --> 01:58.411
I hope you kept
the Homie fires burning.

02:00.175 --> 02:03.509
- Homer! Homer, wake up. Wake up.
- What?

02:03.721 --> 02:08.347
We need to talk about the marital
difficulties we've been having lately.

02:08.559 --> 02:10.386
Marge, there's just too much pressure.

02:10.561 --> 02:12.684
What with my job, the kids,
traffic snarls...

02:12.855 --> 02:14.728
...political strife at home and abroad.

02:14.898 --> 02:20.141
But I promise you the second all those
things go away, we'll have sex.

02:20.321 --> 02:23.820
I simply can't wait that long.
Maybe we should get some help.

02:23.991 --> 02:26.114
- How about a book?
- Okay.

02:26.327 --> 02:27.821
A tasteful book.

02:28.370 --> 02:29.863
Oh, all right.

02:44.511 --> 02:46.800
Hey, Marge, this guy looks like Apu!

02:47.306 --> 02:50.930
I don't want people to see us
looking at these books.

02:51.435 --> 02:52.715
What you looking at?

02:53.562 --> 02:55.140
I'm just reading up on artillery.

02:56.565 --> 02:58.890
Yes, and I'm pursuing my interest in...

03:00.444 --> 03:02.567
This one's a good choice
and it's not smutty.

03:02.738 --> 03:04.446
It's a book on tape by Paul Harvey.

03:04.615 --> 03:08.280
That Midwestern man on the radio
who's like a pleasant version of Grampa.

03:08.494 --> 03:12.408
Mr. And Mrs. Erotic American.

03:12.623 --> 03:13.951
Mom, Dad, look!

03:14.124 --> 03:16.746
This biography of Peter Uebberoth
is only 99 cents.

03:16.919 --> 03:21.213
- And I found the new Al Gore book.
- Sane Planning, Sensible Tomorrow.

03:21.382 --> 03:23.458
I hope it's as exciting
as his other book:

03:23.634 --> 03:25.508
Rational Thinking,
Reasonable Future.

03:25.678 --> 03:27.136
I'm getting this book on UFOs.

03:28.514 --> 03:29.842
Did you know they're real?

03:30.150 --> 03:31.924
But there's a conspiracy
to cover it up.

03:32.101 --> 03:35.386
Oh, that's just a paranoid fantasy.

03:54.707 --> 03:57.910
Mr. Vice President, someone finally
bought a copy of your book.

03:58.127 --> 04:00.618
Well, this calls for a celebration.

04:02.298 --> 04:04.919
Celebrate good times
Come on!

04:05.134 --> 04:06.925
I will.

04:08.762 --> 04:11.510
Hello, Americans. Paul Harvey here.

04:11.390 --> 04:15.933
Did you know every good American
is at heart an erotic American?

04:16.103 --> 04:17.728
It's true.

04:17.896 --> 04:19.225
A famous couple...

04:19.398 --> 04:22.434
I don 't need to tell you it was
Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower.

04:22.609 --> 04:24.649
- Offered this advice:

04:24.862 --> 04:26.938
"Double your pleasure with a bath...

04:27.114 --> 04:28.145
...together."

04:31.493 --> 04:34.530
Homie, I can't quite fit.

04:34.705 --> 04:37.160
The faucet's jammed into my back.

04:37.333 --> 04:38.661
I'm stuck.

04:39.418 --> 04:40.746
So am I.

04:47.259 --> 04:48.967
- Kids?
- Kids?

04:49.136 --> 04:50.761
- Kids?
- Kids?

04:51.805 --> 04:54.592
A romantic vacation
can provide titillation.

04:54.808 --> 04:58.343
Sensual, sanitary seclusion
awaits you at any of America 's fine...

04:58.520 --> 05:01.272
...AAA-approved motor lodges.

05:06.278 --> 05:08.220
The Arabian Nights Room looks nice.

05:08.405 --> 05:11.406
The Pharaoh's Chamber
has a vibrating sarcophagus.

05:11.575 --> 05:14.659
Sorry there, Fred and Ethel.
Should have made a reservation.

05:14.828 --> 05:17.117
We only got one room left.

05:17.331 --> 05:20.830
The toilet is overflowing
in the Caveman Room.

05:23.962 --> 05:28.589
Oh, here we are. The Utility Room.

05:31.303 --> 05:34.221
This isn't very erotic.
I think it's an actual utility room.

05:34.390 --> 05:40.759
No, honey. It's a romantic fantasy.
I imagine I'm the janitor, and you're...

05:40.980 --> 05:45.772
...the janitor's wife, who has to
live with me in the utility room.

05:50.364 --> 05:53.982
Don't mind me, folks.
Just need to get the old wet-dry vac.

05:57.454 --> 06:00.658
By now, your new improved love life
should have you flinging woo...

06:00.833 --> 06:02.541
...like nobody's business.

06:02.710 --> 06:07.288
So to you,
Mr. And Mrs. Erotic American, I bid...

06:07.464 --> 06:09.540
...good day.

06:15.931 --> 06:18.766
Welcome home, son. I broke two lamps
and lost all your mail.

06:18.976 --> 06:21.846
- What's wrong with your wife?
- You wouldn't understand.

06:22.210 --> 06:23.520
- Flu?
- No.

06:23.230 --> 06:24.605
- Protein deficiency?
- No.

06:24.773 --> 06:28.273
Pneumonoultramicroscopic-
silicovolcanoconiosis?

06:28.444 --> 06:30.520
- No.
- Unsatisfying sex life?

06:30.696 --> 06:34.444
N... Yes! But please,
don't you say that word.

06:34.658 --> 06:37.149
What? Sex?

06:37.328 --> 06:40.115
What's so unappealing
about hearing your elderly father...

06:40.289 --> 06:41.700
...talk about sex?

06:41.874 --> 06:44.661
I had sex.

06:49.882 --> 06:53.480
You're home safe. See you
the next time we need your signature.

06:53.260 --> 06:55.502
Oh, you never wanna spend
any time with me.

06:55.679 --> 06:58.431
But I can help you
with your loving problem.

06:58.599 --> 07:02.928
I got a home remedy that'll put
the dowsers back in your trousers.

07:07.441 --> 07:11.308
Legend has it my great grandpappy
stumbled upon this recipe...

07:11.487 --> 07:15.816
...when he was trying to invent
a cheap substitute for holy water.

07:19.870 --> 07:22.954
Here you g... Hey!

07:23.916 --> 07:25.244
Here you go, you ingrate!

07:25.417 --> 07:28.869
Think of me when you're having
the best sex of your life.

07:30.464 --> 07:32.207
Drink it!

07:42.518 --> 07:45.472
Here's $50. Go to the movies,
then take a cab to your aunt's.

07:45.646 --> 07:47.685
Stay there. Call you later.
Now, now, now.

07:48.857 --> 07:52.191
- Homie, what's...?
- Marge, I'll explain to you afterwards.

08:01.745 --> 08:03.702
What do you think Mom and Dad
are doing?

08:03.872 --> 08:05.201
I don't know.

08:15.500 --> 08:19.629
Here he is, Rex Harrison
and Paul Anka rolled into one.

08:21.390 --> 08:23.980
That tonic really works.

08:23.267 --> 08:26.221
You and Grampa should bottle it
and go into business together.

08:26.437 --> 08:28.513
You want me to spend
more time with Dad?

08:28.689 --> 08:30.563
What about my New Year's resolution?

08:30.774 --> 08:32.482
You can make a lot of money.

08:32.693 --> 08:34.934
Yeah. Where are my pants?

08:35.111 --> 08:36.690
You threw them out the window.

08:36.864 --> 08:38.821
You said you'd never
need them again.

08:39.330 --> 08:41.321
Oh, hurry, Neddie. They're awful.

08:41.784 --> 08:43.991
You just be ready
with that garbage bag.

08:46.957 --> 08:48.238
Oh, mama!

08:48.459 --> 08:50.830
This is finally really happening.

08:50.252 --> 08:53.372
After years of disappointment
with get-rich-quick schemes...

08:53.547 --> 08:55.872
...I know I'm gonna get rich
with this scheme.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.129
And quick.

09:01.555 --> 09:03.464
Sir? Hello, sir. Yes.

09:03.641 --> 09:07.306
You look like a man who needs help
satisfying his wife. So...

09:08.729 --> 09:12.140
I guess people have some sort
of moral objection to our sex drug.

09:12.191 --> 09:13.899
Let me sell it, you idiot.

09:15.861 --> 09:19.195
Step right up and witness
the magnificent medicinal miracle...

09:19.365 --> 09:23.825
...of Simpson & Son's
patented Revitalizing Tonic!

09:24.360 --> 09:27.239
Put some ardor in your larder
with our energizing, moisturizing...

09:27.456 --> 09:34.337
...tantalizing, romanticizing, surprising,
"her-prising," revitalizing tonic!

09:38.926 --> 09:43.837
I doubt very highly that one elixir can
boast so many fantastic properties.

09:45.724 --> 09:49.100
What say we amscray out
of here and have a wild wingding...

09:49.186 --> 09:50.597
...at the cyclotron, doctor.

09:50.771 --> 09:53.938
Anything you say, professor.

09:56.193 --> 09:58.766
Tonight, we'll push
the twin beds together.

09:58.946 --> 10:02.778
And I found something for Milhouse
down at the mall too. A pup tent.

10:02.950 --> 10:05.904
Oh, boy!
Now I can sleep out in the yard!

10:06.120 --> 10:07.828
Yeah! Every single night.

10:10.582 --> 10:13.380
I've discovered that
the rejuvenating effect...

10:13.210 --> 10:15.203
...is actually a mild form of poisoning.

10:15.379 --> 10:17.704
No doubt a result
of the unsanitary conditions...

10:17.881 --> 10:19.506
...in Grampa Simpson's bathtub.

10:19.675 --> 10:21.549
Nonetheless...

10:30.853 --> 10:33.260
What's going on?
Where are all the grownups?

10:33.439 --> 10:38.147
Who cares?
With no adults around, I run this city.

10:40.487 --> 10:42.646
Carry on.

10:42.865 --> 10:45.230
Listen to this.
"Unexplainable behavior.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.656
Individuals acting
in a secretive fashion...

10:47.828 --> 10:52.537
...are often involved with UFOs
or other paranormal phenomena...

10:52.708 --> 10:54.866
...e.g. Telephone explosions."

10:55.850 --> 10:58.371
Jeez! If it's in a book,
it's gotta be true.

10:58.589 --> 11:02.717
Scary, no? And this guy is head
of the Spaceology Department...

11:02.926 --> 11:05.168
...at the Correspondence College
of Tampa.

11:05.346 --> 11:07.338
Will you cook my dinner for me?

11:07.514 --> 11:11.464
My parents aren't around and
I'm not allowed to turn on the stove.

11:13.200 --> 11:17.650
Hurry up. We got a lot of tonic to sell
and a lot of towns to visit.

11:17.274 --> 11:20.690
Frigid Falls, Mount Seldom,
Lake Flaccid.

11:20.861 --> 11:24.526
Great. I'm gonna be stuck in a car
all weekend with that wheezy windbag.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.159
And that's what's wrong
with Bart's generation.

11:28.327 --> 11:29.869
Now as for your generation...

11:31.997 --> 11:34.120
And for the minimal outlay
of one dollar...

11:34.291 --> 11:36.782
...you can take home a bottle
of liquid Lothario...

11:36.961 --> 11:41.500
...distilled Don Juan,
catalytically carbonated Casanova.

11:41.215 --> 11:44.963
Lock old Rover in the shed,
because man has a new best friend...

11:45.135 --> 11:48.890
...in Simpson & Son's
Revitalizing Tonic.

11:48.305 --> 11:51.508
I'm not convinced.
I've had bad luck with aphrodisiacs.

11:51.725 --> 11:55.390
All questions will be answered,
all fears will be allayed...

11:55.562 --> 11:57.970
...with one incontrovertible
demonstration.

11:58.148 --> 12:00.818
May I have a volunteer
from the audience?

12:01.260 --> 12:03.190
Yes, you, sir.

12:03.445 --> 12:05.687
You've never seen me before,
is that correct?

12:05.864 --> 12:07.193
That is correct.

12:07.366 --> 12:10.118
Well, then how come his face
is on the bottle?

12:19.712 --> 12:21.400
You're the worst shill ever!

12:21.213 --> 12:23.502
You're a disgrace
to the medicine show business.

12:23.674 --> 12:26.877
They didn't start chasing us until
you turned on that getaway music.

12:44.528 --> 12:47.149
Okay. It's now painfully clear.

12:47.323 --> 12:51.866
The adults are definitely paving the way
for an invasion by the saucer people.

12:52.770 --> 12:55.446
You fool. Can't you see
it's a massive government conspiracy?

12:55.664 --> 12:58.618
Or have they gotten to you too?

13:00.336 --> 13:02.873
Hey, hey, hey! Stop it! Stop it!

13:03.470 --> 13:05.716
Why are you guys jumping
to such ridiculous conclusions?

13:05.924 --> 13:07.798
Haven't you ever heard
of Ockham's razor?

13:07.968 --> 13:10.673
The simplest explanation
is probably the correct one.

13:10.888 --> 13:13.461
- So, what's the simplest explanation?
- I don't know.

13:13.641 --> 13:17.555
Maybe they're all reverse vampires
and they have to get home before dark.

13:18.979 --> 13:24.649
- Reverse vampires!
- Vampires! The undead!

13:25.690 --> 13:28.983
Hey, wait a minute.
That's Amos Pierson's moose farm.

13:29.156 --> 13:30.899
Make a right here.

13:35.788 --> 13:37.579
Why are we stopping at this dump?

13:37.790 --> 13:41.123
That's the house you grew up in, son.

13:43.504 --> 13:45.911
Let's go find
that hot dog tree I planted.

13:46.131 --> 13:50.129
Yeah, we lived here
till the bank foreclosed in '63.

13:50.344 --> 13:54.920
Farm went bust after the cows
started giving sour milk.

13:54.264 --> 13:57.764
Something must've
spooked them good.

13:58.727 --> 14:00.471
Stupid cows!

14:10.781 --> 14:15.407
Oh, memories.
If this old place could talk, it'd say...

14:26.922 --> 14:29.923
There she is. The old Radiation King.

14:30.134 --> 14:35.211
You'd park yourself right there
and watch for hours on end.

14:37.975 --> 14:40.762
If I may, Helen,
I'd like to respond to that question...

14:40.936 --> 14:43.641
...with yet another flip remark.

14:48.736 --> 14:53.148
Look at me, Mom.
I am President Kennedy.

14:53.323 --> 14:57.240
Oh, Abe, maybe our Homer
could grow up to be president someday.

14:58.412 --> 15:01.781
You, president?
This is the greatest country in the world.

15:01.957 --> 15:04.448
We've got a system set up
to keep people like you...

15:04.626 --> 15:06.169
...from ever becoming president.

15:06.587 --> 15:08.496
Quit your daydreaming, melonhead.

15:09.923 --> 15:12.331
Quit your daydreaming, melonhead.

15:12.509 --> 15:15.713
Dad, how come you never gave me
any encouragement?

15:15.888 --> 15:18.593
Maybe I could've been
something more than I am.

15:18.807 --> 15:20.136
Like a travel agent...

15:20.309 --> 15:21.768
...to a great scientist.

15:21.935 --> 15:24.889
Or the inventor
of a hilarious refrigerator alarm.

15:25.640 --> 15:27.685
Who are you to complain?
You lock me up in a home...

15:27.900 --> 15:31.269
...and give me the same damn
shower safety seat every Christmas.

15:33.822 --> 15:35.365
Your whole life,
you never said one nice thing to me.

15:35.532 --> 15:37.691
That's because you're a screwup.

15:37.910 --> 15:40.911
- You're the screwup!
- Why, you little...

15:41.830 --> 15:43.159
All right.

15:43.332 --> 15:45.621
All right, that's it.
We're going home.

15:45.793 --> 15:47.785
I'm sick of you and your stupid tonic.

15:47.961 --> 15:50.417
If I hadn't taken that stupid tonic
38 years ago...

15:50.589 --> 15:53.162
...you'd have never been born
and I'd have been happy.

15:53.384 --> 15:55.175
You were an accident!

15:57.513 --> 15:58.841
Get out.

15:59.140 --> 16:01.505
- I'm sorry I said that.
- Out.

16:01.684 --> 16:03.890
I'm gonna get out of the car.

16:04.610 --> 16:07.644
And I hope you'll find it in your heart
not to drive awa...

16:09.733 --> 16:15.772
Well, I'll be all right as long
as I can remember my Army training.

16:16.824 --> 16:18.947
Dang.

16:23.622 --> 16:26.300
I'm sorry.

16:30.587 --> 16:32.497
Hi?

16:33.590 --> 16:36.959
Homie, are you really going to
ignore Grampa for the rest of your life?

16:37.136 --> 16:39.971
Of course not, Marge.
Just for the rest of his life.

16:40.139 --> 16:42.630
He said I was an accident.
He didn't wanna have me.

16:42.808 --> 16:44.136
You didn't wanna have Bart.

16:44.309 --> 16:46.302
You're never supposed
to tell the child.

16:46.520 --> 16:48.347
You tell Bart all the time.

16:48.564 --> 16:50.272
But when I do it, it's cute.

16:50.649 --> 16:54.861
So finally, we're all in agreement
about what's going on with the adults.

16:55.290 --> 16:58.563
- Milhouse.
- Okay, here's what we've got.

16:58.782 --> 17:00.324
The Rand Corporation...

17:00.492 --> 17:03.992
...in conjunction with the saucer people...
- Thank you.

17:04.163 --> 17:06.320
...under the supervision
of the reverse vampires...

17:09.099 --> 17:11.290
...are forcing our parents
to go to bed early...

17:11.462 --> 17:14.877
...in a fiendish plot
to eliminate the meal of dinner.

17:15.465 --> 17:18.383
We're through
the looking glass here, people.

17:18.594 --> 17:22.342
Kids, your daddy and his daddy
are involved in a very sticky...

17:22.513 --> 17:27.390
...nutty, chewy, chocolatey...
Put it away, boy! ...situation.

17:27.560 --> 17:30.396
And your daddy has realized
something very important.

17:30.606 --> 17:33.726
A father should always make
his kids feel wanted.

17:33.943 --> 17:36.480
Starting now, I promise to spend
more time with you...

17:36.653 --> 17:39.524
...and give you the attention
you deserve.

17:40.282 --> 17:42.441
I can't breathe.

17:43.452 --> 17:45.990
And feast your ears
on this tantalizing testimonial...

17:46.163 --> 17:47.990
...from my own flesh and blood.

17:48.165 --> 17:51.201
The son who puts the fun
in Simpson & Son...

17:51.377 --> 17:53.868
...my son, Barney.

17:54.880 --> 17:58.500
I used to be a fat, disgusting slob.

17:58.717 --> 18:01.837
That medicine seems to be
giving your son a lot of gas.

18:02.540 --> 18:07.131
I assure you his belching is the result
of an unrelated alcohol problem.

18:13.190 --> 18:15.728
It just ain't the same without Homer.

18:16.568 --> 18:18.276
He knew how to drive a car.

18:21.949 --> 18:24.522
Son. My dear son.

18:24.702 --> 18:27.619
From now on, I'm going to be
a good and attentive father.

18:27.830 --> 18:31.199
And for starters, your old man
is gonna teach you how to ride...

18:31.375 --> 18:34.292
...your very first bike.

18:40.900 --> 18:42.630
Dad, number one:
I know how to ride a bike.

18:42.803 --> 18:47.679
Number two: I already own a bike.
And number three: That is a girl's bike.

18:47.850 --> 18:52.975
You're no girl, you're a boy.
A good boy. You can be president.

18:53.147 --> 18:55.851
- Scratch that. You will be president!
- Dad!

18:56.400 --> 18:59.899
I think Lisa needs another push
on her new tire swing.

19:00.612 --> 19:03.150
No, Dad. I wanna get down.

19:03.365 --> 19:06.781
This tire is filthy
and the steel belts are poking me.

19:06.994 --> 19:09.864
No! No!

19:10.800 --> 19:13.414
No offense, but your half-assed
under-parenting was a lot more fun...

19:13.584 --> 19:15.541
...than your half-assed over-parenting.

19:15.753 --> 19:17.579
But I'm using my whole ass.

19:17.796 --> 19:21.331
Dad, it's just that too much
of your love can really be...

19:21.925 --> 19:23.254
...scary.

19:25.512 --> 19:28.347
Someday you'll thank me
for all this scary love.

19:29.600 --> 19:32.517
But now I've gotta go somewhere
and do some serious thinking.

19:34.897 --> 19:39.144
- I'm sure he meant to say "drinking."
- That's what I assumed.

19:42.529 --> 19:45.151
Here's where it all started
to go wrong.

19:45.365 --> 19:49.363
How am I supposed to be a good dad
when I never had one myself?

19:51.330 --> 19:53.821
Oh, Dad wasn't even around
on Christmas morning...

19:53.999 --> 19:56.751
...when I actually got to meet
Santa Claus.

19:56.919 --> 19:58.958
Some father.

19:59.129 --> 20:00.458
Wait a minute...

20:01.256 --> 20:02.834
Dad!

20:04.259 --> 20:06.382
This photo is a blessing.

20:06.553 --> 20:08.380
It eases my pain.

20:17.314 --> 20:20.660
This tonic's caused me nothing
but trouble.

20:20.234 --> 20:23.270
You've done all the damage
you're gonna do.

20:24.238 --> 20:26.563
Oh, nuts!

20:33.205 --> 20:35.162
- Dad!
- Son!

20:35.374 --> 20:38.541
I'm a screwup.
I burned down our house.

20:38.752 --> 20:42.335
No. I'm a screwup.
I burned down our house.

20:42.548 --> 20:44.505
- You know what?
- What?

20:44.717 --> 20:47.920
- We're both screwups.
- It doesn't matter.

20:48.950 --> 20:51.960
What matters is you were right
when you told me...

20:51.265 --> 20:54.883
...I never said anything nice about you.

20:55.102 --> 20:58.518
So are you gonna say
something nice now?

20:58.731 --> 21:00.439
I hadn't thought that far ahead.

21:01.859 --> 21:04.694
Okay, here it goes.

21:04.862 --> 21:08.610
I'm not sorry I had you, son.

21:09.116 --> 21:12.319
And I was always proud...

21:12.494 --> 21:14.985
...that you weren't a short man.

21:15.164 --> 21:16.622
Oh, Dad.

21:21.337 --> 21:23.495
What do you say
we roll on the grass, son?

21:23.672 --> 21:26.210
I'm with you, Dad.

21:27.305 --> 21:33.784
