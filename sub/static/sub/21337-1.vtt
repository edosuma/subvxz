Wait, seriously?

02:41.495 --> 02:42.792
You're calling Kristy.

02:42.793 --> 02:45.039
You're gonna tattle on me.

02:45.040 --> 02:45.791
To Kristy.

02:55.634 --> 02:56.806
Your call has been forwarded

02:56.807 --> 02:59.772
to an automated voice messaging system.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.848
Kristy is not available.

03:04.976 --> 03:06.853
She's not answering.

03:06.978 --> 03:07.854
Oh my god.

03:09.564 --> 03:12.775
That's 'cause Kristy doesn't care.

03:12.776 --> 03:15.695
She didn't answer your phone call either.

03:15.696 --> 03:16.492
Well,

03:17.864 --> 03:18.615
yeah.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.788
Do you think she's okay?

03:25.789 --> 03:26.585
Kristy?

03:39.261 --> 03:41.389
Do not worry about Kristy.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.315
Kristy's fine.

06:09.452 --> 06:10.453
What?

06:29.472 --> 06:30.598
Dude.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.518
You suck at your job.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.689
It doesn't exist.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.738
This house doesn't exist.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.045
Penis!

07:02.881 --> 07:05.134
When are you gonna get
your own mailman truck?

07:05.135 --> 07:09.013
I don't know, not till
I'm full time I guess.

07:10.889 --> 07:13.267
Wait, they don't trust you,

07:14.893 --> 07:16.270
with a mail man truck?

07:16.271 --> 07:18.395
Son of a bitch.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.740
It literally does not exist on my phone.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.024
Dude, I give up.

07:22.025 --> 07:23.902
This is ridiculous.

07:24.027 --> 07:25.028
Let me see.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.215
What are you doing?

07:41.920 --> 07:43.754
Why?

07:43.755 --> 07:46.256
The house doesn't exist.

07:46.257 --> 07:48.476
The letter doesn't exist.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.302
Food exists.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.145
Let's go eat...

08:04.359 --> 08:07.454
Oh my gosh, that really hurt.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.249
You know what Pete?

08:12.250 --> 08:13.368
Thank you man.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.165
You actually helped me out with that one.

08:20.166 --> 08:20.917
Let's go.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.459

Let's do it.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.630

08:28.008 --> 08:30.227
All right, well hurry up.

08:31.803 --> 08:34.471
You know I said I gotta pee?

08:34.472 --> 08:35.312
Yes?

08:35.313 --> 08:36.307
I lied.

08:36.307 --> 08:37.183

That is so cool.

talking to you right now,

27:29.481 --> 27:33.782

27:35.364 --> 27:38.739

30:35.459 --> 30:36.836
She's a virgin.

30:39.713 --> 30:40.678
No.

30:40.679 --> 30:41.468
Virgin.

30:43.508 --> 30:44.760
What? Virgin.

30:47.554 --> 30:49.305
James!

30:49.306 --> 30:50.102
Fuck.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.228
Who the fuck is that?

31:00.025 --> 31:00.992
That a girl?

31:02.027 --> 31:04.621
Oh, is that a naked girl?

31:04.696 --> 31:06.118
Oh shit, I don't have my phone.

31:06.119 --> 31:08.537
Someone take a picture for me.

31:10.035 --> 31:10.786
Oh.

31:12.079 --> 31:13.913
Kristy called me.

31:13.914 --> 31:14.756
What'd she say?

31:14.757 --> 31:16.000
Did she leave a message?

31:16.001 --> 31:18.127
I don't know I'm gonna find out.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.554
What the hell is she doing?

31:26.760 --> 31:27.556
Hey!

31:28.637 --> 31:32.098
You can come join us if you want!

31:32.099 --> 31:33.682
Right?

31:33.683 --> 31:35.434
Do you need help?

31:35.435 --> 31:36.231
'Cause...

31:38.146 --> 31:38.897
Lyndsey.

31:38.980 --> 31:43.110
There's a canoe if you
think that, if you...

31:43.193 --> 31:45.486
What the fuck is wrong with her?

31:45.487 --> 31:47.080
Lyndsey.

31:47.155 --> 31:48.452
What?

31:48.532 --> 31:49.704
What'd she say?

31:50.700 --> 31:53.123
Hey, Ashley,

31:53.203 --> 31:54.170
you're probably confused

31:54.171 --> 31:56.631
that this isn't Kristy's voice
talking to you right now,

31:56.632 --> 32:00.626
but the reasons I'm calling
you with her phone is

32:00.627 --> 32:01.719
I'm with her right now,

32:01.795 --> 32:04.380
and I don't know where we are exactly,

32:04.381 --> 32:05.221
but...

32:05.222 --> 32:06.216
I think that's Pete.

32:06.217 --> 32:08.014
Yeah, Kristy,

32:09.094 --> 32:11.722
she's alive but she's not moving.

32:12.973 --> 32:13.769
I don't know what happened,

32:13.770 --> 32:16.517
but I'll let you know as soon as I can.

32:16.518 --> 32:18.612
Just call me back, please.

32:20.272 --> 32:21.615
Oh, and I'm Pete.

32:22.482 --> 32:23.566
Fuck.

32:25.819 --> 32:27.287
Also I think you're the girls who saw me

32:27.288 --> 32:30.072
in the woods a few hours ago, so...

32:30.073 --> 32:31.541
I hope you enjoyed the show.

32:33.869 --> 32:35.712
Call me, just, call me.

32:37.122 --> 32:39.498
Hope you enjoyed the...

32:39.499 --> 32:40.751
Oh shit I'm sorry.

32:40.834 --> 32:43.043
I'm sorry it's just that's fucking funny.

32:43.044 --> 32:43.886
No, yeah, okay.

32:43.887 --> 32:45.597
Let's find your friend.

32:45.672 --> 32:46.839
Let's do that.

32:46.840 --> 32:48.257
Knock that out.

32:48.258 --> 32:50.384
Then we can find Pete.

32:50.385 --> 32:52.261
Whose dick is not funny.

32:52.262 --> 32:54.685
His dick is not funny at all.

32:54.764 --> 32:55.606
'Cause it's a dick.

33:36.139 --> 33:38.641
I think you should call an
ambulance or something.

33:38.642 --> 33:40.100
I'm already on it.

33:40.101 --> 33:41.727
And AAA too.

33:41.728 --> 33:42.524
On it.

33:43.813 --> 33:45.907
Look at you reading my mind.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.697
Look at you suggesting not even remotely

33:47.698 --> 33:50.361
obvious at all suggestions.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.080
I'm good like that.

34:07.170 --> 34:09.889
Yes, it's 1289 Timmy creek road.

34:12.050 --> 34:12.801
Thank you.

34:16.096 --> 34:17.641
They said they'll be 25 minutes.

34:17.641 --> 34:18.982
So they'll be here in an hour.

34:19.056 --> 34:20.139
If we're lucky.

34:20.976 --> 34:22.273
Great.

34:23.395 --> 34:24.395
I have two bottles

34:24.396 --> 34:27.398
of whiskey in my glove compartment.

34:27.399 --> 34:28.321
You serious?

34:28.400 --> 34:29.275
Yeah, unless you wanted

34:29.277 --> 34:31.150
to go back over to lyndsey?

34:31.152 --> 34:32.616
Why would I wanna do that?

34:32.617 --> 34:33.909
She's all the way over there.

34:52.007 --> 34:52.803
Ashley!

34:54.217 --> 34:56.594
There's six weeks.

34:59.222 --> 35:01.849
James!

35:01.850 --> 35:03.475
Yeah, why not?

35:04.311 --> 35:05.062
What?

35:05.145 --> 35:06.897
Why not? She won't care.

35:41.222 --> 35:42.018
No way.

35:45.435 --> 35:47.904
There's something wrong with her.

35:47.979 --> 35:51.440
She's standing right in front of us.

35:51.441 --> 35:52.693
Completely nude.

35:53.860 --> 35:57.196
There's nothing wrong about that.

35:57.197 --> 35:59.120
I'm serious.

35:59.199 --> 36:02.749
Hey guys, I'm really drunk right now, but,

36:05.205 --> 36:06.798
why is Kristy naked?

36:25.475 --> 36:26.767
Get away from her!

36:26.768 --> 36:27.608
Ashley?

36:27.609 --> 36:28.478
Yes?

36:28.479 --> 36:30.276
What are we gonna do?

36:30.277 --> 36:31.443
I don't know!

36:35.610 --> 36:37.152
Get lyndsey inside!

36:37.153 --> 36:38.826
Break the lock if you have to!

36:38.905 --> 36:40.907
What are you gonna do?

36:40.990 --> 36:44.159
I'll be there in a minute just hurry up!

36:44.160 --> 36:47.663
And don't let anything happen to lyndsey!

36:47.664 --> 36:48.540
Please don't worry,

36:48.623 --> 36:51.001
I'm not gonna fuck him anymore!

37:05.265 --> 37:06.892
I wasn't going to fuck you.

37:06.893 --> 37:07.983
Yeah you were.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.730
I don't want your first time
to be in a sleeping bag.

37:09.731 --> 37:10.568
You kidding me?

37:10.569 --> 37:11.404
What?

37:12.772 --> 37:15.524
Did she tell you I'm a virgin?

37:15.525 --> 37:18.402
Did you tell him I'm a virgin!

37:18.403 --> 37:20.738
Are you saying you're not a virgin?

37:28.163 --> 37:29.460
Wait, so you're not a virgin?

37:52.854 --> 37:54.855
What the fuck James?

37:54.856 --> 37:57.109
It's sturdier than it looks!

37:57.192 --> 37:58.569
Break the glass!

38:01.488 --> 38:04.116
Yeah I was gonna do that next!

38:15.376 --> 38:17.378
You're gonna stay right there.

38:17.462 --> 38:18.714
Sit right there.

38:27.430 --> 38:28.852
Break the glass.

38:29.849 --> 38:31.225
Break the glass.

38:31.226 --> 38:32.728
Piece of shit.

38:32.811 --> 38:35.521
I'll break your fuckin' ass right now.

38:35.522 --> 38:36.364
Bitch.

38:41.778 --> 38:42.574
Fuck!

38:47.283 --> 38:48.205
Seriously.

38:48.206 --> 38:49.794
Seriously!

38:49.869 --> 38:50.791
Seriously?

38:52.539 --> 38:55.713
Looks like you could, use
a little bit of help.

38:55.714 --> 38:57.460
This glass is too thick.

38:57.544 --> 39:00.297
Look, I think we should stay here.

39:01.256 --> 39:04.299
I really think we should go inside.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.884
You got this!

39:05.885 --> 39:06.727
I know.

39:18.439 --> 39:19.406
Door please?

39:25.530 --> 39:26.326
Oh my god!

39:27.240 --> 39:31.076
How long have you been standing there?

39:31.077 --> 39:32.169
Mister Kristy?

39:33.162 --> 39:35.038
Ow, what the hell?

39:36.416 --> 39:40.046
Oh, you're a fucking creepy ass old man!

39:40.128 --> 39:42.504

39:43.348 --> 39:44.506
He is.

39:44.507 --> 39:47.134
It's Kristy's grandpa.

39:47.135 --> 39:48.635
No it's not.

39:48.636 --> 39:50.220
What?

39:54.434 --> 39:56.482
Who are you old geezer?

39:57.562 --> 39:58.358
Do you think we could figure out

39:58.438 --> 40:01.112

What the fuck?

42:07.864 --> 42:10.203
What the fuck is he doing?

42:12.572 --> 42:13.994
Don't mind him.

42:19.829 --> 42:21.877
She's not coming in here.

42:36.054 --> 42:36.805
See.

42:42.852 --> 42:45.571
The fuck is going on here?

42:45.646 --> 42:47.114
Who are you?

42:51.444 --> 42:54.038
Excuse me children.

42:54.113 --> 42:55.740
You son of a bitch!

42:58.910 --> 43:02.204
I's afraid we have some
unfinished bidness here.

43:02.205 --> 43:04.539
It's gonna require your help.

43:04.540 --> 43:05.957
I don't think so.

43:05.958 --> 43:06.754

43:07.835 --> 43:09.336
<i>Boy -</i>

43:23.309 --> 43:27.187
my family here gonna have
to require your presence

43:27.188 --> 43:29.231

43:29.232 --> 43:33.026
Til we get this thing fixed up right.

43:33.027 --> 43:34.449

Now what do we have here?

I'm Francis.

43:48.209 --> 43:50.462

43:52.547 --> 43:54.506
And that there,

43:54.507 --> 43:57.477

44:13.109 --> 44:15.443
Why does she look like Kristy?

44:15.444 --> 44:16.912
What the fuck did you do to her?

44:16.913 --> 44:19.703
Don't make no sudden moves girl.

44:21.534 --> 44:23.207
We's all in this now.

44:24.620 --> 44:26.839
Whether you like it or not.

44:31.377 --> 44:32.128
Daddy?

44:33.254 --> 44:36.006
Are they gonna die tonight?

44:36.007 --> 44:38.305
Take the sample Felicity.

44:38.384 --> 44:42.480
You don't need to be concerning
yourself with this now.

44:44.599 --> 44:46.188
Hell no, no fucking samples.

44:46.189 --> 44:47.309
You're not touching me.

44:47.310 --> 44:48.106

You mother fuckers.

45:03.868 --> 45:06.786
No need for that tone boy.

45:06.787 --> 45:10.337
Lest you want a bullet tween your eyeballs.

45:14.795 --> 45:18.298
Or maybe you want a bullet
tween your nether parts?

45:18.299 --> 45:19.095
Ah fuck.

Okay, okay.

45:22.678 --> 45:25.388

45:25.389 --> 45:26.231
Stop.

45:26.232 --> 45:29.017
Lord god almighty, goddamn girl.

45:53.209 --> 45:54.005
Daddy.

45:55.211 --> 45:58.215
They're not gonna die tonight, right?

46:00.675 --> 46:02.552
I told you, Felicity.

46:04.637 --> 46:08.181
You don't have to concern yourself

46:08.182 --> 46:10.401

46:12.812 --> 46:14.439
Are ya fucking deaf?

47:23.841 --> 47:25.514

47:27.845 --> 47:31.725
Didn't you say you was gonna tell 'em?

47:31.807 --> 47:32.603
I lied.

47:36.562 --> 47:38.690
Don't you do nothin' girl.

47:39.607 --> 47:41.735
You got what you needed from us.

Just please let us go.

47:43.819 --> 47:44.695

47:45.780 --> 47:46.576
The blood.

47:49.200 --> 47:51.623
Philip, take her to the altar.

47:54.997 --> 47:55.748
No, no, no.

47:55.831 --> 47:58.129
No no no, no no no!

47:58.209 --> 47:59.376
No!

47:59.377 --> 48:03.507
Goddamn you insane family
of Satan worshiping cunts!

48:06.592 --> 48:08.811
Ah, James?

48:08.886 --> 48:10.103
Burn in hell!

48:21.107 --> 48:23.326

48:27.863 --> 48:31.584

48:33.327 --> 48:35.453
You hear that baby?

48:35.454 --> 48:38.164
You just hold on one more minute.

48:38.165 --> 48:40.917
Hold on one minute longer.

48:40.918 --> 48:41.714
No!

48:44.672 --> 48:46.595
Oh goddammit Felicity!

48:48.384 --> 48:51.058
This ain't how you said
it was gonna be daddy.

48:51.137 --> 48:53.179
That ain't momma.

48:53.180 --> 48:55.014
I know it ain't!

48:55.015 --> 48:56.232
It's all wrong!

48:57.226 --> 48:59.227
This whole thing's all wrong.

49:04.358 --> 49:05.530
I know it is.

49:06.610 --> 49:08.829
It all just went all wrong.

49:10.364 --> 49:11.866
But we gon' fix it.

49:13.826 --> 49:15.123
I'm gon' fix it.

49:17.830 --> 49:20.800
My baby's finally coming back to me.

49:23.502 --> 49:24.298
Philip.

49:27.673 --> 49:28.469
Philip.

49:30.468 --> 49:34.189
Won't you bring momma
on in here with us son.

49:36.891 --> 49:37.687
Go.

49:50.529 --> 49:51.325
Felicity.

49:54.116 --> 49:57.791
You remember when I said,
I was gon' bring us

49:59.330 --> 50:01.298
all back together again?

50:02.833 --> 50:03.875
Yeah.

50:03.876 --> 50:05.469
You remember when I said that,

50:05.470 --> 50:08.796
I said no matter what the cost?

50:08.797 --> 50:11.132
No matter what the cost,

50:11.133 --> 50:13.602
you remember when I said that?

50:15.137 --> 50:17.185
Now what'd you say to me?

50:19.225 --> 50:20.850
I said,

50:20.851 --> 50:21.647
thank you.

50:26.148 --> 50:29.072
Say it for me, one more time baby.

50:30.110 --> 50:32.533
I wanna hear it one last time.

50:37.618 --> 50:39.410
Thank you daddy.

50:39.411 --> 50:41.630
That's my sweet Felicity.

50:46.335 --> 50:48.258
No matter what the cost.

50:54.760 --> 50:56.728
No matter what the cost.

51:08.649 --> 51:10.777
I'm a real sumbitch dad.

51:11.819 --> 51:14.618
Don't you dare disrespect your...

51:32.339 --> 51:34.762
Thank you Philip.

51:50.357 --> 51:51.904
What do we do now?

52:12.421 --> 52:14.469
Y'all know how to read?

52:18.719 --> 52:19.886
Yeah.

52:19.887 --> 52:20.729
You do?

52:20.730 --> 52:22.394
Okay, all right now.

52:23.724 --> 52:24.566
Good.

52:25.559 --> 52:27.560
There you are.

52:27.561 --> 52:28.528
You too boy.

52:36.362 --> 52:37.454
Start readin'!

52:42.618 --> 52:44.202
Philip?

52:44.203 --> 52:48.174
Grab that chalice and
freshen up this pentagram.

52:49.875 --> 52:51.501
Oh and Philip?

52:51.502 --> 52:53.504
Hand me one of them guns.

53:00.427 --> 53:01.178
I got it.

53:11.355 --> 53:12.151
Read!

53:13.273 --> 53:15.321
What are we supposed to be looking for?

53:15.322 --> 53:23.168
Banishment, banishment,
banishment, banishment.

53:24.618 --> 53:26.666
Banishment, apparently.

53:33.252 --> 53:36.381
Felicity none of this is in English.

53:40.175 --> 53:43.725
Banishment, banishment,
banishment, banishment.

53:43.804 --> 53:44.680
Felicity!

53:46.348 --> 53:48.567
None of this is in English.

53:59.903 --> 54:00.779
The fuck?

54:03.240 --> 54:04.913
Banishment, banishment, banishment.

54:24.511 --> 54:25.683
Shit!

55:00.714 --> 55:01.590
Hey guys?

55:02.674 --> 55:04.642
Think I found something.

55:05.677 --> 55:07.395
Fuck yeah I found it!

55:12.309 --> 55:15.279
By the unholy name, I banish thee.

55:16.355 --> 55:19.074
From the grasp of the roots that choke,

55:19.149 --> 55:21.859
by the name of the she-goat of the womb,

55:21.860 --> 55:24.487
and by the blood of the son
of the lamb of the flood,

55:24.488 --> 55:25.614
yes. Yes, yes!

55:26.865 --> 55:27.661
All right.

55:34.039 --> 55:35.916
I think I might need a band-aid.

55:41.046 --> 55:42.423
Classic Philip.

55:59.898 --> 56:00.649
Are...

56:02.359 --> 56:04.157
Either of you virgins?

56:05.195 --> 56:05.991
What?

56:06.989 --> 56:07.740
No.

56:09.449 --> 56:10.245
No, no.

56:11.201 --> 56:12.041
No, I'm not.

56:12.042 --> 56:13.002
I'm not a virgin.

56:13.078 --> 56:14.245
Okay.

56:14.246 --> 56:15.122
Well shoot.

56:25.215 --> 56:26.507
A ton of girls.

56:26.508 --> 56:27.884
Give you a list.

56:27.885 --> 56:30.058
Give you a list right now.

57:02.544 --> 57:03.340
Ashley.

57:04.546 --> 57:07.516
You're a very special, special girl.

57:11.219 --> 57:13.888
Three and three, come to thee.

57:13.889 --> 57:16.807
Drink and the end shall come to he.

57:16.808 --> 57:19.231
But tonight, it comes to she.

57:21.772 --> 57:24.482
I'll have to improvise a bit but,

57:24.483 --> 57:26.986
I reckon I can make this work.

57:27.986 --> 57:29.028
Philip?

57:29.029 --> 57:32.203
I've got some very special news for ya.

57:33.158 --> 57:33.875
Philip?

57:36.995 --> 57:37.746
Philip!

57:40.040 --> 57:40.916
Come on now!

57:54.262 --> 57:55.058
Shit.

57:56.640 --> 57:57.482
No!

57:58.892 --> 57:59.643
No.

58:07.234 --> 58:08.901
No no no no no, shit!

58:55.365 --> 58:58.244
You was a real good son of a bitch.

58:59.327 --> 59:02.547
May he have mercy on your goddamn soul.

59:07.627 --> 59:11.213
Okay, we're gon' have to move fast.

59:11.214 --> 59:13.257
I mean real fast.

59:13.258 --> 59:15.760
I think with little bit of luck,

59:15.761 --> 59:18.512
and if we follow these instructions,

59:18.513 --> 59:20.311
we can make it outta here.

59:20.390 --> 59:21.141
Alive.

59:22.517 --> 59:24.393
You understand me?

59:24.394 --> 59:25.441
Yeah, yeah.

59:26.772 --> 59:27.898
Oh shoot, no you don't.

59:27.981 --> 59:29.358
Exactly as I say.

59:30.317 --> 59:31.694
Exactly.

59:31.777 --> 59:34.371
Else we ain't gonna like the results.

59:42.662 --> 59:43.458
Fuck.

59:44.456 --> 59:46.800
Just tell us what we need to do.

59:46.875 --> 59:47.671
Good.

01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:27.002
All right.

01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:29.129
We got me.

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:31.169
We got you.

01:00:32.879 --> 01:00:33.801
We got you.

01:00:43.014 --> 01:00:43.765
Got you.

01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:47.226
Perfect.

01:00:47.227 --> 01:00:48.149
Take off your pants.

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:53.023
What?

01:00:53.024 --> 01:00:54.446
We need her too.

01:00:56.528 --> 01:00:58.445
Ashley, Ashley, Ashley,

01:00:58.446 --> 01:01:00.323
Ashley, three in three.

01:01:02.242 --> 01:01:03.368
Pure and free.

01:01:05.287 --> 01:01:07.710
Our numbers just ain't enough.

01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:10.082
What the fuck?

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:11.297
What are you talking about?

01:01:11.298 --> 01:01:13.136
Ashley, what is she talking about?

01:01:13.137 --> 01:01:16.463
Ashley I know you know what I mean.

01:01:16.464 --> 01:01:18.382
The revenge.

01:01:18.383 --> 01:01:21.102
And she is as pure as an angel.

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:24.889
Okay, okay.

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:25.730
Come on now.

01:01:25.731 --> 01:01:26.566
Oh.

01:01:30.061 --> 01:01:33.190
With Philip and me, she makes three.

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:37.152
It's the only way.

01:01:39.154 --> 01:01:40.155
Okay, okay.

01:01:41.489 --> 01:01:42.285
Okay, yeah.

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:43.207
Okay, okay.

01:01:43.208 --> 01:01:44.408
Okay.

01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:46.286
This is gonna be messy.

01:01:49.998 --> 01:01:50.749
Uh uh.

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:53.051
What?

01:01:53.052 --> 01:01:55.002
Turn around.

01:01:55.003 --> 01:01:57.552
You ain't lookin'.

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:00.512
Get.

01:02:03.428 --> 01:02:04.645
All right, now let's do this.

01:02:04.646 --> 01:02:06.096
No, okay.

01:02:06.097 --> 01:02:07.264
Felicity.

01:02:07.265 --> 01:02:08.141
I got this.

01:02:10.435 --> 01:02:11.903
All right.

01:02:11.978 --> 01:02:13.571
Just tryin' to help.

01:02:41.216 --> 01:02:43.634
Oh don't be a pussy.

01:02:43.635 --> 01:02:45.469
Here, give it, I got it.

01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:47.097
That's not normal.

01:02:48.807 --> 01:02:50.150
That's fucking unnatural.

01:02:57.148 --> 01:02:58.400
You done good.

01:03:10.662 --> 01:03:12.209
You done real good.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:17.793
Please tell me that's it.

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:19.341
Only one remains.

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:23.801
Drop your pants.

01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:27.059
What?

01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:27.847
Now!

01:03:27.848 --> 01:03:28.688
Drop 'em!

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:37.697
Stop dickin' around, hurry up now!

01:03:37.698 --> 01:03:39.189
Just do what she says!

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:39.907
Okay!

01:03:40.025 --> 01:03:40.742
Fuck!

01:04:12.807 --> 01:04:13.849
Oh shit.

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:15.309
Six seconds!

01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:16.277
I'm sorry.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:19.688
Impressive.

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:21.066
Fuck I'm sorry.

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:27.197
It's okay, just

01:04:28.907 --> 01:04:33.083
thought my first time was gonna
be a little bit different.

01:04:39.417 --> 01:04:41.010
What do we do now?

01:05:05.485 --> 01:05:06.327
That's it.

01:05:08.196 --> 01:05:10.619
You gotta do exactly as I say.

01:05:13.785 --> 01:05:14.581
Yeah.

01:05:16.037 --> 01:05:18.039
All right, let's begin.

01:06:24.439 --> 01:06:25.691
What the hell?

01:06:36.451 --> 01:06:37.202
Fuck!

01:06:39.078 --> 01:06:40.921
What the fuck is this shit?

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:43.123
This better fucking work!

01:06:43.124 --> 01:06:45.125
The time is come!

01:06:45.126 --> 01:06:46.503
Dammit!

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:52.809
For my daughter, we bestow praise.

01:06:54.385 --> 01:06:55.427
Shit!

01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:57.897
I'm done.

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:02.100
I'm done, fuck this!

01:07:02.101 --> 01:07:02.897
Fuck this.

01:07:02.977 --> 01:07:03.728
Fuck!

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:15.035
From a sister we bestow
everlasting damnation.

01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:17.495
Wait.

01:07:36.135 --> 01:07:36.886
Come on.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.647
Get it down.

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:52.734
Done good Ashley.

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:54.282
You done real good.

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:00.705
What?

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:06.707
From the brother we relinquish
the unclaimed souls,

01:08:06.708 --> 01:08:08.961
the inferno whence she came.

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:12.881
Drink it!

01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:16.384
Just drink it dammit!

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:53.511
Just fucking do it!

01:09:03.348 --> 01:09:06.192
Swallow it!

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:09.144
Swallow it James.

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:10.020
Swallow it.

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:15.859
Baby I need you to swallow this right now.

01:09:15.859 --> 01:09:19.321
Baby, baby, baby, I need you to swallow it.

01:09:19.322 --> 01:09:23.372
All right, else this
banishment will come undone.

01:09:29.624 --> 01:09:30.999
Swallow it!

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.834
Swallow it James!

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:34.461
For tonight she comes,

01:09:34.462 --> 01:09:36.840
and tonight she shall return.

01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:43.013
You got this.

01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:48.642
You can do this.

01:09:57.694 --> 01:09:59.116
Burn demon, burn!

01:10:08.287 --> 01:10:09.083
No!

01:10:10.623 --> 01:10:12.916
You simple fucking fool!

01:10:41.612 --> 01:10:43.159
Go James!

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:46.997
Fuck this!

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:18.486
Fuck!

01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:20.321
You bitch!

01:11:29.035 --> 01:11:30.207
You fucking, little...

01:11:30.411 --> 01:11:31.663
Fuck!
