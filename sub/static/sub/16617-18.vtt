00:00.834 --> 00:02.701
<i>You're watching</i>
The Last Man on Earth.

00:02.703 --> 00:04.103
Yes!

00:04.105 --> 00:05.771
<i>Catch all-new episodes Sundays.</i>

00:05.773 --> 00:07.873
<i>And check out</i>
<i>our other Fox programs,</i>

00:07.875 --> 00:09.341
Bob's Burgers--
Whoo!

00:09.343 --> 00:11.543
Brooklyn Nine-Nine
<i>and</i> Family Guy.

00:11.545 --> 00:14.446
-Can me and Ramon
go ride shirtless bikes?
-(sighs)

00:14.448 --> 00:15.514
<i>Only on Fox.</i>

00:17.350 --> 00:19.051
<i>Previously on</i>
The Last Man on Earth...

00:19.053 --> 00:22.621
I hold here what are probably
Lewis's remains.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.556
(drone buzzing)

00:24.558 --> 00:25.858
(screams)

00:25.860 --> 00:26.959
It's a girl.

00:26.961 --> 00:28.394
CAROL:
What are you gonna call her?

00:28.396 --> 00:29.395
Dawn.

00:29.397 --> 00:31.797
<i>Because it's</i>
<i>the dawn of a new day.</i>

00:31.799 --> 00:33.198
Oh, farts.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.972
She's beautiful.

00:39.974 --> 00:42.374
I know everyone says that,
but she is.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.376
(crying):
She's an angel!

00:44.378 --> 00:45.978
(gags)

00:45.980 --> 00:48.547
I think I might
need to excuse myself.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.249
(baby cooing)
Feeling a
little queasy.

00:50.251 --> 00:53.519
Not because of your blood
and goop, Erica.

00:53.521 --> 00:54.987
(strained):
That was beautiful.

00:54.989 --> 00:57.256
But in a way,
it does make me feel the need

00:57.258 --> 00:59.992
to puke and lie down.

00:59.994 --> 01:01.760
Bye, Carol.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.762
Okay, I'm supposed to check
her hearing and reflexes,

01:03.764 --> 01:05.097
when you have a chance.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.532
No, not letting go yet.

01:06.534 --> 01:08.667
I don't like babies.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.436
But she's a good one.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.204
I'm gonna spoil her.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.006
I don't care
who knows it.

01:14.008 --> 01:16.075
Guys, guys, I need all your
attention up here, please.

01:16.077 --> 01:18.577
Uh, Erica had her baby,
you friggin' idiot.

01:18.579 --> 01:19.745
Oh, great!

01:19.747 --> 01:22.581
Oh, my God,
oh, gorgeous baby, Erica.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.416
Tandy, that's the placenta.
Oh, good.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.852
'Cause it doesn't look
anything like you, yeah. Ew.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.020
Okay, look, uh,

01:28.022 --> 01:29.755
come with me, please.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.191
Uh, we're a little busy.
This is super important.

01:32.193 --> 01:34.526
What's more important
than a baby being born?

01:34.528 --> 01:36.295
That.

01:36.297 --> 01:38.697
Oh, my God.

01:47.707 --> 01:50.976
Tandy, are you absolutely sure
that's a nuclear meltdown?

01:50.978 --> 01:53.045
Oh, maybe it's just
a huge regular fire

01:53.047 --> 01:55.214
coming directly out
of the inside

01:55.216 --> 01:57.282
of a frigging nuclear reactor.

01:57.284 --> 01:58.283
Burn.

01:58.285 --> 01:59.618
Yeah, I-I'm pretty sure.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.386
TODD:
Yeah,

02:01.388 --> 02:03.322
Lewis talked about this,
he said...

02:03.324 --> 02:04.890
bridges would start collapsing,

02:04.892 --> 02:06.925
satellites would start
falling from the sky,

02:06.927 --> 02:09.128
and, you know, this.

02:09.130 --> 02:12.397
Ah, Lewis, a good man,
and so very, very wise.

02:12.399 --> 02:14.233
Except when it came to flying
a plane, am I right?

02:14.235 --> 02:15.501
MELISSA:
But is it even safe

02:15.503 --> 02:17.469
for us to be on the roof?
I mean, are we getting

02:17.471 --> 02:19.438
radiation poisoning
just being out here?

02:19.440 --> 02:20.506
Oh, good point, Melissa, yeah.

02:20.508 --> 02:21.840
Maybe we should all
do one of these.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.609
Hey, guys, remember
Jasper's here, all right?

02:23.611 --> 02:25.644
Oh, yeah. Jasper, do this
if you want to live.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.280
TODD: Tandy...
GAIL: Okay, what in God's
name are we gonna do?

02:28.282 --> 02:30.449
Let's get the hell out of here.
Where are we gonna go?

02:30.451 --> 02:32.084
I don't know,
just grab what we can

02:32.086 --> 02:33.285
and drive away from that.

02:33.287 --> 02:35.354
Good call. Gail, you tell Erica,
I'll tell Carol.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.422
Okay, collars up,
every second counts.

02:37.424 --> 02:38.824
Move, move, move!

02:40.793 --> 02:42.861
(CPAP machine whirring)

02:47.200 --> 02:48.534
(whispering):
Carol.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.869
(screams) My goldang gol!
Care Bear,

02:50.871 --> 02:52.471
it's just me, it's just me.

02:52.473 --> 02:53.939
Oh, you got to
tread lightly, Tandy.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.440
You know I'm a paranoid napper.

02:55.442 --> 02:56.441
I'm sorry, sorry.

02:56.443 --> 02:58.944
Look, I-I got a little, uh...

02:58.946 --> 03:01.680
How should I put this? Uh...

03:01.682 --> 03:04.683
thing of interest,
uh, to tell you.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.652
Can I tell you something
interesting first?

03:06.654 --> 03:09.154
Uh, uh, uh, yeah, sure, yes.

03:09.156 --> 03:11.857
Did you know that I used
to be deathly afraid

03:11.859 --> 03:15.460
of sliding out of long booths
in Mexican restaurants?

03:15.462 --> 03:18.197
I did not know that
about you, Carol, no.

03:18.199 --> 03:21.333
Until one day,
a very talented therapist

03:21.335 --> 03:23.335
took me to
Casa Gallardo

03:23.337 --> 03:27.306
and made me watch her slide
in and out of a long booth

03:27.308 --> 03:29.174
with elegance and class.

03:29.176 --> 03:31.577
And that's what happened
when I saw that birth.

03:31.579 --> 03:35.514
That baby slid out of Erica
with elegance and class

03:35.516 --> 03:38.650
just like Dr. Weem did
in that Mexican booth.

03:38.652 --> 03:41.186
Oh, oh.
(sighs)

03:41.188 --> 03:43.655
I just needed to see it
go well once.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.557
And I'm not afraid anymore.

03:47.026 --> 03:48.961
We have created
the perfect home.

03:51.097 --> 03:52.931
And I can't imagine raising
our baby anywhere else.

03:54.834 --> 03:57.002
Yeah, okay, well, uh,

03:57.004 --> 04:00.505
as always, I commend you on that
whimsical, seemingly pointless

04:00.507 --> 04:02.774
yet suddenly relevant wind-up
to what could've been

04:02.776 --> 04:05.244
a really boring bit
of regular old information.

04:05.246 --> 04:07.746
Well, I learned it
from the best.

04:08.214 --> 04:09.281
(blows)

04:12.352 --> 04:13.652
(gulps)

04:17.090 --> 04:18.156
(blows)

04:20.927 --> 04:22.961
Okay.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.129
Wait, what were you
gonna tell me?

04:24.131 --> 04:26.598
Uh, uh, uh...

04:26.600 --> 04:28.033
just a joke, you know?

04:28.035 --> 04:29.968
Uh, why did the banker
quit his job?

04:29.970 --> 04:31.370
(squeals)
Why?

04:31.372 --> 04:32.537
'Cause he lost interest.

04:32.539 --> 04:34.606
(laughs hysterically)

04:39.045 --> 04:41.713
I'm peeing.

04:41.715 --> 04:42.914
I peed a little.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.583
Well, uh, why don't you
clean yourself up

04:44.585 --> 04:45.651
and go back to sleep, huh?

04:45.653 --> 04:48.553
Oh, no, it wasn't
a toilet amount.

04:48.555 --> 04:49.488
Okay.

05:02.835 --> 05:04.202
(vacuum running)

05:05.471 --> 05:06.838
(vacuum stops)

05:24.023 --> 05:26.758
Good-bye, dear friend.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.960
I know I gave you
a lot to deal with,

05:28.962 --> 05:31.630
but you took it like
a real toilet.

05:31.632 --> 05:32.898
(soft chuckle)

05:35.935 --> 05:38.603
(toilet flushes)

05:38.605 --> 05:40.672
(sniffling)

05:45.278 --> 05:48.613
We had a lot of
good times in here.

05:48.615 --> 05:49.981
But like
the dinosaur,

05:49.983 --> 05:52.751
all good things
must come to an end.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.654
MELISSA (whispering):
Okay, let's go before

05:55.656 --> 05:58.290
we all start to
glow in the dark.

05:58.292 --> 05:59.391
TODD (whispering):
Come on, bud.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.126
Wait, where's Carol?

06:01.128 --> 06:02.661
She's sleeping.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.496
GAIL: Well, go
wake her ass up.

06:04.498 --> 06:08.200
Don't worry,
it's all taken care of.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.268
(rattling)

06:15.508 --> 06:17.209
Tandy. Tandy?

06:17.211 --> 06:19.177
What?
The whole house is
bouncing and jiggling.

06:19.179 --> 06:20.912
I think we're having
an earthquake.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.147
(giggling):
What?

06:22.149 --> 06:24.216
I don't feel anything
but aggressive stability.

06:24.218 --> 06:25.317
Issue resolved.

06:25.319 --> 06:26.918
Now let's go back to
bed for a long time.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.553
Oh. Oh! Oh.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.088
Okay. All right.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.990
No, no, no, Carol!
No, no, no, no!
Okay, get in the door jamb!

06:31.992 --> 06:33.959
Carol, no, don't, don't,
don't! No, no, no, no!

06:37.196 --> 06:38.830
Tandy!

06:38.832 --> 06:40.899
(screams)

06:48.674 --> 06:50.542
What in Bruce Almighty
is happening?

06:50.544 --> 06:52.577
Road trip!

06:52.579 --> 06:54.279
What? I'm about to have a baby!

06:54.281 --> 06:56.782
Exactly, so this is,
like, our last chance

06:56.784 --> 06:58.350
to do something
spur of the moment

06:58.352 --> 07:01.453
before we become
boring, old parents.

07:01.455 --> 07:03.922
Tandy, turn this flipping house
around and take me the flip home

07:03.924 --> 07:06.224
before I completely
lose my flipping crumbs!

07:06.226 --> 07:08.293
I'll have to talk to Todd;
he's driving.

07:08.295 --> 07:09.361
Actually got the
whole crew up there.

07:09.363 --> 07:11.263
Got your medical equipment,

07:11.265 --> 07:12.697
all your scrapbooks,

07:12.699 --> 07:15.200
and basically all the stuff
that people could quickly grab.

07:15.202 --> 07:18.236
Erica even brought her
new baby, which is fun.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.539
Okay, Tandy, I'm gonna ask you
this one more time:

07:20.541 --> 07:22.574
onto which what is going?

07:22.576 --> 07:26.278
(laughing):
Nothing.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.846
Tandrew!

07:30.650 --> 07:32.784
Carol, we can't go back.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.853
Why the gol not?

07:35.888 --> 07:37.456
Look.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.562
There's no easy way to say this.

07:43.564 --> 07:46.264
So I'm gonna go ahead
and sing it.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.200

08:27.941 --> 08:30.275
How's it going
back there, Erica?

08:30.277 --> 08:31.610
ERICA:
Super awesome.

08:31.612 --> 08:32.811
You know what they say,

08:32.813 --> 08:34.179
always wait
till your baby's 12 hours old

08:34.181 --> 08:36.548
before racing away
from a nuclear dust cloud.

08:36.550 --> 08:38.316
What's a nuclear dust cloud?

08:38.318 --> 08:39.484
Um.

08:39.486 --> 08:41.620
It's a, it's a ska band

08:41.622 --> 08:44.523
I used to listen to
back in the '90s.

08:44.525 --> 08:45.790
It's a poisonous cloud
that gives you cancer

08:45.792 --> 08:46.958
and slowly kills you.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.326
Melissa.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.128
Why didn't we bring the cow?

08:50.130 --> 08:51.630
We didn't bring the cow.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.697
GAIL:
Oh, my God.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.132
We forgot the freaking cow?

08:54.134 --> 08:55.367
Come on.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.068
We didn't bring
the freaking cow!

08:57.070 --> 08:59.337
Damn it.
ERICA:
Oh, geez.

08:59.339 --> 09:01.072
I would've brought the cow.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.074
Yeah.
Yeah.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.076
Hey, we've been driving around
for, like, three hours.

09:05.078 --> 09:08.713
Shouldn't we try and figure out
what the hell it is we're doing?

09:17.189 --> 09:19.658
TANDY:
Hey, guys.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.493
I found an Army surplus store
and I hooked us up

09:21.495 --> 09:24.262
with one of these
little bad boys. Now, Jasper,

09:24.264 --> 09:25.897
this is what's called
a Geiger counter,

09:25.899 --> 09:27.432
or a Gizzy kizzy.

09:27.434 --> 09:29.668
Okay? Now, if we're safe,
it doesn't make any noise.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.403
But if we get
into a dangerous

09:31.405 --> 09:34.673
radioactive area,
it will start making a sound

09:34.675 --> 09:36.708
like this...

09:36.710 --> 09:38.009
(farts)

09:38.011 --> 09:39.244
Thought that would register.

09:39.946 --> 09:41.513
So you guys, uh, find any info?

09:41.515 --> 09:42.714
MELISSA:
I-I found this book

09:42.716 --> 09:44.215
about what would happen
if all civilization vanished.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.584
And it says,

09:45.586 --> 09:48.353
sooner or later, all these
nuclear reactors are gonna blow.

09:48.355 --> 09:49.588
Ooh, what does it say
we should do?

09:49.590 --> 09:51.222
In the book we're all dead.

09:51.224 --> 09:52.591
My book here says
that we're good

09:52.593 --> 09:55.060
outside of a hundred-mile radius
of a meltdown.

09:55.062 --> 09:58.063
Well, just to be safe,
let's make it 102.

09:58.065 --> 09:59.297
Yeah.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.466
Well, okay, so when can
we go back to our building?

10:01.468 --> 10:03.435
20,000 years.

10:03.437 --> 10:06.204
Any wiggle room?

10:06.206 --> 10:08.073
No wiggles, Carol.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.908
Okay, I'm trying
to be cool here,

10:09.910 --> 10:13.111
but I just need to know
where I'm gonna have my baby.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.646
TODD:
Why don't we just...

10:14.648 --> 10:16.781
move somewhere where
there are no nuclear plants?

10:16.783 --> 10:18.149
I second that. Seconded, yeah.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.318
That may be a bit of a problem.

10:24.423 --> 10:25.457
Oh, my God.

10:25.459 --> 10:26.591
Oh.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.293
Oh, gol, gol, gol.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.961
Mexico looks pretty clear.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.229
Yeah, there's only one
down there,

10:31.231 --> 10:33.231
but this book
was written in 1998,

10:33.233 --> 10:35.133
so who knows
how many there are now?

10:35.135 --> 10:36.735
What other choice do we have?

10:36.737 --> 10:38.503
TODD: But those things
are everywhere.

10:38.505 --> 10:40.305
How the hell are
we gonna get down there?

10:40.307 --> 10:43.341
All we have to do is get past
this little ring of nukes,

10:43.343 --> 10:44.843
and if they haven't
popped their tops,

10:44.845 --> 10:46.177
I believe we're good to go.

10:46.179 --> 10:49.814
And if there's any problem,
we'll know.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.250
Then I guess
we're going to Mexico.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.753
Well, as long as we're going
to Mexico,

10:54.755 --> 10:57.288
Melissa and I have a pitch.

10:57.290 --> 11:00.692
(à la Andy Dufresne):
There's a little place
on the Pacific Ocean.

11:00.694 --> 11:03.595
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

11:03.597 --> 11:05.597
(à la Red):
They say it has no memory.

11:05.599 --> 11:08.366
That's where I want
to live the rest of my life.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.301
A warm place with no memory.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.037
Zihuatanejo.
Zihuatanejo.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.872
<i>Shawshank... Redemption.</i>

11:13.874 --> 11:15.540
What?

11:15.542 --> 11:17.642
Yeah, whatever. Let's freaking
jam this taco stand.

11:17.644 --> 11:18.710
Yeah.

11:26.285 --> 11:27.552
Come on. Here it is.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.487
(baby crying)
(laughing): Oh!

11:29.489 --> 11:31.156
I'm so sorry, Erica.

11:31.158 --> 11:33.224
God, I didn't know
it was chow time there, huh?

11:33.226 --> 11:36.528
(chuckles) I will give you and
your breasts a little privacy.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.697
Full respect in full effect.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.665
You know what, Tandy,
it's no big deal.

11:40.667 --> 11:41.900
This is gonna be happening
a lot around here,

11:41.902 --> 11:43.968
you might as well
get used to it.

11:43.970 --> 11:46.171
Good point, yeah,
might as well, uh,

11:46.173 --> 11:49.808
rip off the Band-Aid
and get on in there.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.478
So, not latching on, huh?

11:53.480 --> 11:55.380
Am I using
the correct terminology?

11:55.382 --> 11:56.548
Latching on?

11:56.550 --> 11:58.316
You know what,
a bit of privacy might be good.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.318
Oh, yeah-- uh, respect.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.486
Yeah, respect.

12:01.488 --> 12:02.721
All right.

12:05.658 --> 12:08.393
GAIL:
Hey, Carol, relax.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.994
When we get down there,

12:09.996 --> 12:13.665
we are gonna get that
delivery room up and running.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.834
And you got nothing
to worry about.

12:15.836 --> 12:18.069
That is
a Gail Klosterman guarantee.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.404
You hear me?

12:19.406 --> 12:21.506
Thanks, Mom.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.408
Okay.
TODD: Hey, guys!

12:23.410 --> 12:25.443
Tijuana: 72 miles!

12:25.445 --> 12:27.712
(whooping)
(horn honks)

12:27.714 --> 12:30.415
(yelping)

12:30.417 --> 12:32.016
(à la Red):
I have to remind myself,

12:32.018 --> 12:35.053
some birds
aren't meant to be caged.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.521
So get busy livin'...

12:36.523 --> 12:38.590
or get busy dyin'.
Or get busy dying.

12:38.592 --> 12:39.691
(horn honks)

12:39.693 --> 12:44.162
It truly was
a Shawshank redemption.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.869
(quietly):
Tom Hanks.

12:52.138 --> 12:54.806
(Geiger counter ticking)

12:56.041 --> 12:57.675
(ticking intensifies)

13:03.315 --> 13:04.949
Oh, farts.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.724
Well, we can't go north,
we can't go south,

13:12.726 --> 13:15.493
east is like Nukeville U.S.A.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.462
Guess we only have one option.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.931
Oh, don't say it.

13:19.933 --> 13:22.333
Los Angeles.

13:23.435 --> 13:25.003
CAROL:
Okay, so we're just gonna

13:25.005 --> 13:28.072
drive back to a place
that we specifically left

13:28.074 --> 13:30.675
because a crazy man
was trying to kill us?

13:30.677 --> 13:32.911
Don't worry
about Pat.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.012
Who's Pat?

13:34.014 --> 13:35.413
TODD:
Uh, he's a purveyor

13:35.415 --> 13:37.582
of ice cream, uh,
brief incarcerant...

13:37.584 --> 13:39.584
jean art enthusiast.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.519
No, he's the guy
that tried to murder us.

13:41.521 --> 13:42.687
Okay? And then
Todd ran over him

13:42.689 --> 13:44.756
with his car and then
squished out all his guts,

13:44.758 --> 13:47.091
and then somehow the guy got
his guts squished all back in.

13:47.093 --> 13:49.427
(groans)
And now he's still out there,

13:49.429 --> 13:51.362
probably pretty pissed.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.431
Look, we are gonna haul ass
out to that marina,

13:53.433 --> 13:54.833
we're gonna hop on a boat,

13:54.835 --> 13:56.601
and we're gonna
get out on the ocean.

13:56.603 --> 13:57.936
I mean, that's the only place

13:57.938 --> 14:01.139
we can be sure
there's no radioactive schnizz.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.607
Gail's right.
It's our only move.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.309
Does anyone know
how to drive a boat?

14:04.311 --> 14:06.377
(laughs) I have some experience
with, uh, boats...

14:06.379 --> 14:08.847
Does anyone else know
how to drive a boat?

14:08.849 --> 14:09.948
We are gonna be fine.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.449
We're gonna hug the shore,

14:11.451 --> 14:12.550
and we're zip down the coast

14:12.552 --> 14:14.519
to Zihuatanejo.

14:14.521 --> 14:15.920
We have got this.

14:18.224 --> 14:21.793
TANDY:<i> Come on. Let's do this</i>
<i>as quickly as possible.</i>

14:26.966 --> 14:28.066
Okay, it's clear, come on.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.801
I got gas.

14:29.803 --> 14:31.903
I-I mean-mean,
you know what I mean.
Come on, let's go.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.972
TANDY: Okay.

14:39.979 --> 14:41.346
Hey, Care Bear.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.748
I know this has
been a big day,

14:43.750 --> 14:46.050
so I set up a little oasis
for you in the house.

14:46.052 --> 14:48.753
You know, I lit some
aromatherapy candles,

14:48.755 --> 14:52.156
put on some Gregorian chants,
laid out a few butt plugs...

14:52.158 --> 14:54.993
JK, but I did do the
candles and the butt plugs.

14:55.995 --> 14:58.663
JK, it was the candles
and the chants,

14:58.665 --> 15:00.999
and that's my final answer.
(chuckles)

15:01.001 --> 15:03.167
Well, I appreciate it, Tandy,

15:03.169 --> 15:06.771
but I think I just need
to walk around a little bit.

15:06.773 --> 15:08.873
You okay?

15:08.875 --> 15:10.875
Yeah.
(chuckles)

15:10.877 --> 15:13.578
Just a lot's coming down
on this pregnant lady.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.180
Oh, come here.

15:16.182 --> 15:18.449
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you. Okay?

15:20.519 --> 15:22.287
I promise.

15:22.289 --> 15:23.888
That goes for you, too.

15:23.890 --> 15:26.791
Thanks, Tandy.

15:28.961 --> 15:31.029
(Gregorian chants playing)

15:33.465 --> 15:35.033
(Dawn crying)

15:35.035 --> 15:36.434
Why won't you eat?

15:36.436 --> 15:37.602
Testify.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.438
Can I help you, Tandy?

15:40.440 --> 15:42.807
Just checking in.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.776
Still not taking the nub, huh?

15:44.778 --> 15:46.744
(sighs)
No, not yet.

15:46.746 --> 15:49.414
Hey, do you mind if I have
a little word with her?

15:49.416 --> 15:51.683
(sighs)

15:53.652 --> 15:56.120
Hey, Dawn...

15:56.122 --> 15:59.257
just do it. Huh?

15:59.259 --> 16:01.793
Oh.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.094
Now try.

16:03.096 --> 16:04.762
Okay.
TODD:
All right, guys.

16:04.764 --> 16:06.831
We're entering Los Angeles.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.910
Quiet as a church mouse.

16:18.912 --> 16:22.180
(whispering):
Notoriously quiet mice.

16:22.182 --> 16:25.416
So, are we gonna have some
sort of plan if we do see Pat?

16:25.418 --> 16:26.951
Carol, don't worry, okay?

16:26.953 --> 16:28.586
Pat is most likely dead.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.755
And in the
one-in-a-billion chance

16:30.757 --> 16:32.323
that he's alive and in L.A.,

16:32.325 --> 16:35.259
there's, like, zero chance
that he could ever find us.

16:35.261 --> 16:36.394
(Gregorian chants playing)

16:39.698 --> 16:41.766
It's a huge city,

16:41.768 --> 16:42.934
and there's, like,
thousands of streets.

16:42.936 --> 16:44.135
So we're just gonna take

16:44.137 --> 16:45.303
all the little,
teeny, tiny streets

16:45.305 --> 16:46.604
that nobody ever goes on,

16:46.606 --> 16:49.007
and we're gonna hop on the boat,
and we're good to go.

16:49.009 --> 16:51.042
(Gregorian chants playing)

16:54.680 --> 16:56.547
We're one little RV.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.616
We're like a needle
in a haystack.

16:58.618 --> 16:59.884
I'll take it one step further.

16:59.886 --> 17:01.719
The needle is hay-colored.

17:01.721 --> 17:04.956
And the haystack
is made of needles.

17:04.958 --> 17:06.357
I'm telling you,

17:06.359 --> 17:10.762
there is no way that Pat
could ever find us. (chuckles)

17:20.639 --> 17:22.707
(ice cream truck music plays)

17:38.924 --> 17:41.359
GAIL:<i> We're clear. Let's pick</i>
<i>a boat and start loading.</i>

17:41.361 --> 17:43.594
ERICA:
<i>What's that smell?</i>

17:43.596 --> 17:45.663
Ugh! Pickles on a picnic!

17:45.665 --> 17:48.699
Uh, Carol. I-I-It's
nobody's fault.

17:48.701 --> 17:51.836
But our home. The baby's room.

17:51.838 --> 17:52.937
Aw, it's okay, hon.

17:52.939 --> 17:54.539
We're gonna help you
make another one.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.941
Yeah, Carol,
a-all those things?

17:56.943 --> 17:58.676
It's just stuff.

17:58.678 --> 18:01.212
You know, the only thing that
really matters is right here.

18:01.214 --> 18:02.914
The six of us.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.949
There are eight of us.

18:04.951 --> 18:06.284
Well, uh, you know,

18:06.286 --> 18:08.519
a gentleman never counts
himself or his wife.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.054
Maybe we should
go pick a boat.
Yes.
Yeah.

18:10.056 --> 18:12.156
TANDY:
Yes, we should.

18:16.395 --> 18:19.730
Well, here's two
solid candidates,

18:19.732 --> 18:20.898
<i>Ship Happens</i>

18:20.900 --> 18:23.568
and<i> The Sea Word.</i>

18:23.570 --> 18:25.903
MELISSA: Hey, you guys can take
whatever boat you want,

18:25.905 --> 18:28.873
but I'm taking this one.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.609
Come on.
<i>No Boats about It?</i>

18:31.611 --> 18:33.644
It's like they
didn't even try.

18:37.149 --> 18:39.617
Get out of town.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.620
Yeah. Finally got her.

18:44.389 --> 18:48.793
Hmm. Hungry little sucker.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.562
Making up for
lost time, huh?

18:51.564 --> 18:54.165
Oh, the miracle of nipples.

18:54.167 --> 18:55.900
Nature's horchata.

18:55.902 --> 18:59.804
Yeah, my mom told me it took
me a long time to latch,

18:59.806 --> 19:03.307
but once I did,
I never let go. Ask Carol.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.176
Tandy.
No, seriously, ask her.

19:05.178 --> 19:06.177
Okay, we good?

19:06.179 --> 19:07.678
Yeah, let's shove off.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.614
Okay, first, I'd like
to make a little toast.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.749
Uh, you know, I'd really
rather get going, bud.

19:11.751 --> 19:12.984
Yeah, Tandy, we don't have time.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.253
(scoffs) Americans.
Hurry up and wait.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.487
You feel me, Erica?

19:16.489 --> 19:17.655
I don't.

19:17.657 --> 19:18.689
(laughs)
Here you go, Gail.

19:18.691 --> 19:19.924
What?

19:19.926 --> 19:21.259
TANDY:
Todd, Melissa.

19:22.528 --> 19:24.929
Anyway, the word
toast comes to mind

19:24.931 --> 19:27.365
because America
is now toast to us.

19:27.367 --> 19:30.434
The cruel winds
of change and radioactivity

19:30.436 --> 19:33.337
have pushed us to sea,
and unlike Dawn,

19:33.339 --> 19:35.106
who took a while
to start sucking,

19:35.108 --> 19:37.441
this group has sucked
from the very start...

19:38.777 --> 19:41.345
...from the teat of friendship.

19:47.219 --> 19:48.486
Now, I'll keep this brief

19:48.488 --> 19:50.221
'cause I know that time
is of the essence.

19:50.223 --> 19:52.957
But, uh, I'd like to spend
five minutes per person

19:52.959 --> 19:54.725
on what each of you mean to me.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.561
Here, Todd, here's a timer.
Please don't let me go under.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.329
GAIL: Tandy!

19:58.331 --> 19:59.463
Let's go.

19:59.465 --> 20:01.866
Gail.
(groans)

20:01.868 --> 20:03.467
The moment I first heard
your Southern lilt,

20:03.469 --> 20:06.804
I thought I had died
and gone to the plantizzy.

20:06.806 --> 20:10.875
Equal parts class and sass,
the word "pert" jumps to mind.

20:15.747 --> 20:19.350
(in Australian accent):
Dawn. Australian for "baby."

20:19.352 --> 20:22.220
(chuckles) Like the first
light of the new day.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.821
Or a dishwashing detergent

20:23.823 --> 20:25.990
that cuts through grease
like a knife.

20:25.992 --> 20:31.195
But that's not a knife,
this is a baby.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.167
♪<i> Waltzing Matilda.</i> ♪
Everybody.

20:36.169 --> 20:37.935
Tandy, can we wrap this up?

20:37.937 --> 20:39.837
Of course, Melissa. I'm done.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.406
But at the same time,
I'm just getting started,

20:42.408 --> 20:44.275
because we're safe now.

20:44.277 --> 20:45.876
And when it comes
to the happiness

20:45.878 --> 20:47.545
and well-being of this group,

20:47.547 --> 20:51.015
I can 100%,
absolutely, positively,

20:51.017 --> 20:56.454
with absolutely no reservations,
assure you, positively...

20:56.955 --> 20:58.055
(all gasping)

20:58.057 --> 20:59.523
...this is only the beginning.

20:59.525 --> 21:01.325
PAT:
Of the end.

21:03.762 --> 21:05.830
Remember me?

21:07.132 --> 21:08.432
(screaming)

21:09.368 --> 21:10.701
(gunshot)

21:10.703 --> 21:12.036
(screaming)

21:17.609 --> 21:21.345
Hi. I'm Pamela.
