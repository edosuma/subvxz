00:00.078 --> 00:01.468
_

00:01.533 --> 00:02.642
I know what you did.

00:02.643 --> 00:04.482
Sent Wes, LeSean, and them
to give Taylor a beat down.

00:04.483 --> 00:05.632
I never told them to do anything.

00:05.695 --> 00:06.503
That's why he came back with the gun.

00:08.031 --> 00:10.342
Becca sold drugs to
the kid who shot Wes.

00:10.367 --> 00:11.990
- Who do we call?
- We're not calling anybody.

00:11.991 --> 00:13.191
We can't hide this.

00:13.192 --> 00:15.000
They want my resignation?

00:15.001 --> 00:18.585
When a tragedy like this happens, of
course there's gonna be a transition.

00:18.664 --> 00:20.090
If you tell me to,

00:20.091 --> 00:21.960
there are things that I could
find out about that school.

00:21.961 --> 00:24.040
My son's not crazy. He's not a killer.

00:24.041 --> 00:26.418
H-He was... He was
pushed to do something.

00:26.443 --> 00:28.403
I need people to understand that.

00:30.171 --> 00:33.090
Tell my mom it's over.

00:33.091 --> 00:35.180
She should move on.

00:35.181 --> 00:37.071
She's not gonna do that, you know?

00:37.071 --> 00:39.050
She'll listen to you.

00:39.051 --> 00:41.131
But why would I deliver that message?

00:43.492 --> 00:45.572
She needs to hear it from somebody.

00:45.572 --> 00:49.257
My whole life's been nothing
but a problem for her.

00:49.297 --> 00:51.625
She would be way better off
if I'd never been born.

00:52.305 --> 00:54.405
- That's self-pity.
- No, that's how it is.

00:54.407 --> 00:56.708
Every extra thing she's
had to do for me,

00:56.743 --> 00:59.077
to give up because of me...

01:01.448 --> 01:04.715
Having things wouldn't
have made her life better.

01:04.768 --> 01:07.769
All I'm doing... I'm
taking responsibility.

01:07.804 --> 01:10.004
You can't take responsibility
for your mother's choices.

01:10.056 --> 01:12.190
I'm taking it for my own.

01:12.192 --> 01:13.958
- For stealing the gun?
- Yeah.

01:16.079 --> 01:18.079
For shooting the boy?

01:21.418 --> 01:24.535
Responsibility and guilty
are closely linked here.

01:24.571 --> 01:26.738
Do you feel guilty about this incident?

01:32.228 --> 01:33.778
What I feel...

01:39.953 --> 01:43.755
Do you feel guilty about anything else?

01:52.265 --> 01:55.266
You know how, um...

01:55.318 --> 01:58.319
my mom gave me up once?

02:00.323 --> 02:01.522
I know why she did,

02:01.558 --> 02:06.260
but I, um, never really got it.

02:06.296 --> 02:07.545
Now I do.

02:07.597 --> 02:11.332
It's hard, but if you
care about someone,

02:11.368 --> 02:12.567
you don't want to drag
them down with you.

02:12.619 --> 02:14.302
You got to... You got to let go.

02:14.337 --> 02:15.687
How are you going to do this?

02:15.722 --> 02:19.374
Just tell her I get it.

02:24.013 --> 02:25.413
What did he say?

02:25.448 --> 02:26.948
He says he gets it.

02:32.322 --> 02:33.805
He's giving up.

02:33.857 --> 02:35.890
He's trying to be brave.

02:37.143 --> 02:38.993
That's not brave.

02:39.045 --> 02:41.746
Not talking to me, not
talking to a lawyer...

02:41.798 --> 02:44.432
That's just gonna put him in jail.

02:44.484 --> 02:46.701
Taylor's not a shooter.

02:46.736 --> 02:49.537
Taylor's not just a shooter.

02:49.589 --> 02:52.156
People need to know that.

We're hungry, Daddy.

03:34.434 --> 03:35.650
We're gonna get some pizza.

03:35.685 --> 03:37.902
Just give me one minute, hon, all right?

03:37.937 --> 03:39.353
What are you doing?

03:39.405 --> 03:41.689
I told you I was helping people.

03:41.741 --> 03:43.191
Daddy's helping.

03:43.243 --> 03:45.359
What is it?

03:45.411 --> 03:46.944
Here. Come here.

03:46.946 --> 03:48.613
See that?

03:48.615 --> 03:51.582
That's... That's justice.

03:58.458 --> 03:59.907
Want something to eat?

03:59.943 --> 04:01.526
No.

04:01.561 --> 04:03.578
You got time.

04:03.613 --> 04:05.246
I'm good.

04:06.933 --> 04:09.133
I'm good.

04:10.687 --> 04:12.753
They reopened that school too soon.

04:13.857 --> 04:15.022
Just got to get back to normal.

04:15.058 --> 04:16.557
That's all.

04:16.608 --> 04:18.358
They're kids.

04:18.394 --> 04:21.978
They had a classmate that
was killed on campus.

04:21.981 --> 04:25.316
Doing algebra doesn't
make things "normal."

04:35.662 --> 04:37.628
I don't feel well.

04:37.664 --> 04:39.380
I'm not going to school today.

04:39.415 --> 04:41.265
Oh, yes, you are.

04:41.301 --> 04:43.251
But I don't feel well.

04:43.303 --> 04:45.853
You're going to school.
Now, get dressed.

04:45.889 --> 04:48.005
We're leaving in five minutes.

04:48.041 --> 04:49.340
Go.

04:54.347 --> 04:57.014
You know, you don't even
know if she's sick.

04:57.066 --> 04:58.099
She's not.

04:58.151 --> 04:59.517
You're just making her go to school.

04:59.519 --> 05:01.686
Look, we're living our lives.

05:01.688 --> 05:04.939
We just... We got... We got
to go about our business.

05:06.576 --> 05:08.576
You're torturing her.

05:08.611 --> 05:10.411
What do you think jail is?

05:13.616 --> 05:16.083
Hey, look, I know you feel guilty.

05:17.871 --> 05:19.704
I know...

05:19.756 --> 05:23.174
I know you don't know what's
the right thing to do.

05:23.209 --> 05:25.476
What's the alternative? That's what we
got to think about... the alternative.

05:25.511 --> 05:26.727
And we got to show Becca

05:26.763 --> 05:28.880
that we're working
together to protect her.

05:28.932 --> 05:30.381
Now, I'm gonna take her to school,

05:30.383 --> 05:34.352
and I'll check in on her all day.

05:38.091 --> 05:40.358
Come on, Becca! Let's go!

05:54.991 --> 05:55.890
Hello?

05:55.925 --> 05:57.875
Sebastian. It's Anne.

05:57.911 --> 05:58.809
Thank you.

05:58.845 --> 06:00.544
Yeah, you're welcome.

06:11.057 --> 06:12.473
Hey, something's not right.

06:12.508 --> 06:14.675
All right, something happened.

06:14.727 --> 06:16.677
I'm hearing you, Wes,
and a bunch of others,

06:16.729 --> 06:18.846
uh, jumped Taylor.

06:18.881 --> 06:20.898
- Who's saying stuff?
- It doesn't matter who.

06:22.235 --> 06:23.768
Did you beat him up?

06:24.938 --> 06:27.571
Did you beat him up?

06:28.942 --> 06:30.241
Yeah.

06:31.511 --> 06:33.444
Are you for real, man? That's...

06:33.496 --> 06:34.612
That's why he came back?

06:34.664 --> 06:36.197
Wes is dead because you went at Taylor.

06:36.249 --> 06:37.281
You realize that.

06:37.317 --> 06:38.449
Dude, we did what you told us to.

06:38.451 --> 06:40.034
What I told... I never told you a...

06:40.086 --> 06:41.321
I never told you a thing.
What are you...

06:41.346 --> 06:42.086
You sat there talking

06:42.121 --> 06:43.587
about how bitches need to act correct

06:43.623 --> 06:46.624
and how bitches can get handled.

06:46.676 --> 06:49.126
So, yeah. We handled it for you.

06:50.630 --> 06:53.130
I mean... I mean... I
mean, the boy was crazy.

06:53.182 --> 06:54.548
He had something against this whole team

06:54.600 --> 06:56.934
since way back when, so
he was gonna get a gun,

06:56.970 --> 07:00.054
and he was gonna do what he
was gonna do no matter what.

07:00.106 --> 07:02.056
Wes is dead.

07:02.108 --> 07:03.107
Man, look. Look!

07:04.360 --> 07:05.943
He's gone, man.

07:07.697 --> 07:11.115
He's dead. He's not coming back, man.

07:11.167 --> 07:12.416
That don't mean nothing to you?

07:12.452 --> 07:14.285
Man, we did it for you.

07:14.337 --> 07:16.170
For you.

07:16.205 --> 07:17.254
For me?

07:17.290 --> 07:18.456
So you just need to chill, all right?

07:18.508 --> 07:19.757
Leave it alone.

07:22.962 --> 07:25.379
For me.

07:25.431 --> 07:27.631
Just for me, hmm?

07:34.517 --> 07:36.417
I shouldn't care as much as I do.

07:36.453 --> 07:39.899
I know that, but I can't... not care

07:40.105 --> 07:42.706
even when I know it
doesn't make any sense.

07:43.157 --> 07:45.524
Sometimes, giving yourself a new start

07:45.559 --> 07:47.776
in the wake of a trauma is
the smartest thing to do.

07:47.828 --> 07:50.395
There is a difference
between walking away

07:50.431 --> 07:52.464
and getting shoved aside.

07:52.516 --> 07:54.533
I was in a system that
made the mistakes,

07:54.568 --> 07:56.919
but the board wants to put
those mistakes on me.

07:57.004 --> 07:59.404
They want me to...

07:59.440 --> 08:01.874
sink with them to the bottom of a river.

08:01.926 --> 08:05.394
I tried to do good
things with my position,

08:05.429 --> 08:07.179
and for them to use that

08:07.214 --> 08:09.615
as an excuse to get rid of me, I...

08:12.520 --> 08:15.370
Giving in is just
admitting they're right.

08:16.540 --> 08:18.273
I'm a lawyer.

08:18.325 --> 08:20.242
I can only give you legal advice.

08:20.294 --> 08:23.562
That's what I'm asking.
I'm asking legal advice.

08:23.597 --> 08:26.481
Have you spoken to anyone
since the shooting?

08:26.517 --> 08:27.549
About what?

08:27.585 --> 08:29.568
About the shooting.

08:29.603 --> 08:31.587
About how you might be feeling
under the circumstances.

08:31.622 --> 08:33.672
How I feel is like I'm
being scapegoated,

08:33.707 --> 08:37.142
and what I'm asking is your help
in doing something about it.

08:37.178 --> 08:43.398
Look, if that boy had shot me,
what would I have died for?

08:43.450 --> 08:44.583
If it was something of merit,

08:44.585 --> 08:49.154
then I need to make sure
that something survives.

08:49.206 --> 08:51.473
This is...

08:51.508 --> 08:54.927
This is me dealing.

08:54.962 --> 08:58.947
My advice, legal or otherwise...

08:58.983 --> 09:03.101
Settle for a good exit package
and move on with your life.

09:15.933 --> 09:17.666
- ¿El muchacho te tocó?
- Sí.

09:17.701 --> 09:21.153
¿El Señor Dixon sobre lo que pasó?

09:22.873 --> 09:24.489
No.

09:24.525 --> 09:27.209
¿Por qué no le dijiste a alguien?

09:27.244 --> 09:29.328
Vi lo que le pasó a mi amigo.

09:29.330 --> 09:33.665
A nadie le importo, y
las cosas empeoraron,

09:33.701 --> 09:35.500
así que...

09:35.536 --> 09:38.237
Yo no iba a decir nada.

09:38.272 --> 09:40.038
All right, let's take two.
Two out! Two out!

09:40.074 --> 09:41.623
Come on! Come on!

09:41.659 --> 09:43.041
Go!

09:44.712 --> 09:46.311
Let's go. Come on, D.

09:48.449 --> 09:49.648
- There you go.
- Right, right, right, right.

09:49.650 --> 09:51.083
- There you go.
- Quit fouling me. Quit pushing in.

09:51.085 --> 09:52.751
- Quit fouling me!
- All right, shake it off.

09:52.803 --> 09:54.720
- You can't guard me without fouling me!
- Shake it off. Shake it off.

09:54.772 --> 09:56.605
I want to see some passing, now.
Come on, find your teammate.

09:56.657 --> 09:57.856
Give me the... Give me the ball.

09:57.858 --> 09:59.224
Let's go. Pass it now.

10:02.129 --> 10:02.961
- And one.
- Do the play.

10:02.963 --> 10:03.895
- And one!
- Do the play.

10:03.948 --> 10:04.947
- And one!
- You can't do the play.

10:04.982 --> 10:06.481
Switch out. Switch out. Switch out.

10:06.533 --> 10:08.166
Stop, all right? Enough. Shake it off.
Let's go.

10:11.121 --> 10:12.704
Off, off! Come on. Let's
circle the wagon.

10:12.740 --> 10:14.122
Circle the wagon. Circle the wagon.

10:17.044 --> 10:18.560
Here we go.

10:24.518 --> 10:25.617
Hey.

10:25.653 --> 10:27.035
Hey, hey!

10:28.055 --> 10:29.721
- Get off me.
- Get up off me, gay boy!

10:29.723 --> 10:31.273
- What'd you say?
- You heard me!

10:31.325 --> 10:33.625
- Hey, hey, hey.
- You can get this, too!

10:33.677 --> 10:35.177
- It ain't your fight.
- I don't need this.

10:35.212 --> 10:37.396
I don't need y'all. To hell with y'all!

10:37.398 --> 10:39.948
Come on, man. We're all
backing the same team.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.169
Eric!

11:01.221 --> 11:02.838
Hey. Where you going?

11:02.890 --> 11:04.673
I'm out.

11:04.725 --> 11:06.274
If you leave, you're done.

11:06.327 --> 11:07.743
You think I care?

11:07.778 --> 11:10.379
Oh, come on. LeSean was a dumbass.

11:10.431 --> 11:11.546
Oh, I don't give a... about him.

11:11.598 --> 11:13.098
There's nothing here.

11:13.133 --> 11:14.533
This team is a joke.

11:14.568 --> 11:17.336
The... team is a joke.

11:17.388 --> 11:20.105
This whole joint is just... It's...

11:20.107 --> 11:22.791
It's like a show that
rich people put on.

11:22.843 --> 11:24.543
They can act how they want
and say what they want,

11:24.545 --> 11:25.560
but it's not real.

11:25.596 --> 11:27.662
This isn't real to you?

11:27.698 --> 11:30.999
You walk away, think you can
tell me none of this is real?

11:31.035 --> 11:32.851
You...

11:32.886 --> 11:35.320
You... You don't know
what it's costing me

11:35.322 --> 11:36.321
to make this team work.

11:36.323 --> 11:38.557
And you see me asking?

11:40.394 --> 11:42.828
This is my life you're talking about.

12:03.734 --> 12:05.200
Mike, it's Leslie.

12:05.235 --> 12:06.535
Leslie, we've got a problem.

12:06.570 --> 12:07.552
Yeah.

12:07.588 --> 12:08.887
It's serious.

12:08.922 --> 12:10.906
The school servers have been hacked.

12:10.941 --> 12:13.041
- They've been...
- Documents have been posted online.

12:13.093 --> 12:16.027
- What kind of documents?
- E-mails, internal memos

12:16.063 --> 12:17.662
relating to the whole
Taylor Blaine incident.

12:17.698 --> 12:19.631
- Where?
- They're on a TOR server,

12:19.666 --> 12:21.767
and it's already flying
around social media.

12:21.802 --> 12:24.169
- Have you called our I.T. manager?
- I called you.

12:24.204 --> 12:26.204
What's been posted is pretty ugly.

12:26.240 --> 12:28.790
- It makes the school look...
- Let's not discuss this on the phone.

12:28.842 --> 12:31.059
Let's meet face-to-face right away.

12:32.613 --> 12:34.329
- VonnerTech.
- This is Jake Marston.

12:34.364 --> 12:36.164
Jake, it's Leslie Graham
from The Leyland School.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.632
I have just been told we've been hit

12:37.668 --> 12:39.801
with some kind of cyber attack.

12:39.837 --> 12:41.103
I need you to close the firewall,

12:41.138 --> 12:43.905
shut down the server, and
deny access system-wide.

12:43.941 --> 12:45.240
I'm here. It's done.

12:45.275 --> 12:46.691
Review the server access logs.

12:46.743 --> 12:49.361
Find out which accounts have
been accessing the data.

12:49.413 --> 12:50.829
Yeah, we're gonna scan the servers.

12:50.864 --> 12:52.030
We need to do a full breach review.

12:52.032 --> 12:53.748
Find out exactly what was compromised

12:53.784 --> 12:54.833
and let me know.

12:54.868 --> 12:56.952
Jake, call me first.

13:00.707 --> 13:02.089
What happened?

13:02.348 --> 13:04.499
Hey.

13:04.692 --> 13:06.091
W-What's going on?

13:06.127 --> 13:07.776
A fight... The basketball team,

13:07.812 --> 13:09.061
they're fighting each other.

13:09.096 --> 13:10.663
Something's going on,

13:10.698 --> 13:12.331
and Dan's not doing anything about it.

13:12.366 --> 13:14.600
Or... Or he won't do anything.

13:14.652 --> 13:15.517
Okay, I'll take care of it.

13:15.569 --> 13:17.252
No, don't.

13:17.288 --> 13:18.988
Well, if it's a problem,
I will handle it.

13:19.023 --> 13:22.491
Michael, we can't just
handle things anymore.

13:22.493 --> 13:23.826
His friend is dead,

13:23.878 --> 13:26.178
and acting like we can buy our
way into making that bet...

13:26.230 --> 13:27.529
We just need to talk to Kevin.

13:28.649 --> 13:32.468
We can talk to him all day long.

13:32.470 --> 13:35.304
We need to get him to
start talking to us.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.860
Hey. You got a minute?

13:41.896 --> 13:43.412
I'm in the middle of some things.

13:43.447 --> 13:47.082
I-I just need a minute.

13:47.134 --> 13:50.653
Dr. Lewis says you're going to
make a statement at my review.

13:50.705 --> 13:53.122
Yes.

13:53.174 --> 13:55.557
Is there anything in particular
you're going to talk about?

13:55.559 --> 13:58.410
That's for the board.

14:01.949 --> 14:04.917
Dr. Lewis keeps telling
me this review is, uh...

14:04.952 --> 14:06.618
It's just standard.

14:06.654 --> 14:08.587
They're just going to tick
some boxes, and that's that.

14:08.622 --> 14:10.489
If that's what she's telling you...

14:12.860 --> 14:15.961
If... If... If there's any other
thing I'm being set up for,

14:15.996 --> 14:17.663
I would really appreciate
it if you'd let me know.

14:17.698 --> 14:18.964
I don't want to be caught off-guard.

14:18.999 --> 14:21.617
I mean, I-I'm asking you.

14:22.536 --> 14:23.619
Please.

14:28.743 --> 14:29.992
What happened in that fight

14:30.027 --> 14:32.745
between Mateo and the
black student... Tre?

14:32.780 --> 14:34.763
Mateo got a three-day suspension

14:34.799 --> 14:37.766
for attacking Tre... by the book.

14:37.818 --> 14:39.585
And nothing for Tre?

14:39.620 --> 14:42.004
Tre was the victim.

14:42.039 --> 14:44.139
You wanted to do what was
right for the victim.

14:44.141 --> 14:45.357
Yes.

14:45.393 --> 14:48.927
You know, I do outreach
with Hispanic students.

14:48.963 --> 14:52.181
One of the young girls I
see is Evy Dominguez.

14:52.216 --> 14:54.717
She told me Tre not only bullied her

14:54.752 --> 14:56.085
and used racial slurs,

14:56.120 --> 14:59.121
but also touched her...

14:59.156 --> 15:01.090
aggressively.

15:01.092 --> 15:03.108
That's sexual assault.

15:04.195 --> 15:06.779
She didn't... She didn't
say anything to me.

15:06.814 --> 15:08.397
Did you ever follow up with her?

15:08.432 --> 15:11.200
I've got nearly 2,000 students, Monica.

15:11.252 --> 15:13.018
I can't follow up on every one of them.

15:13.053 --> 15:15.104
Mateo told you what happened.

15:15.139 --> 15:16.822
He told you Evy was being harassed.

15:16.874 --> 15:19.174
He didn't tell me about
her being touched.

15:19.176 --> 15:22.361
When you broke up the fight,
Mateo called Tre the "N" word.

15:22.413 --> 15:25.247
Maybe after that, you didn't
want to hear anything else.

15:26.186 --> 15:27.769
Look, I think you're a good person,

15:27.804 --> 15:29.771
I really do, but you got it wrong,

15:29.806 --> 15:31.356
and a lot of people got hurt.

15:31.408 --> 15:33.708
I think you need to go into
that review, admit fault,

15:33.743 --> 15:35.176
and admit to your own bias.

15:35.212 --> 15:37.645
- Say I'm a racist?
- Say you made a mistake.

15:37.697 --> 15:39.480
It's not true.

15:39.516 --> 15:41.332
There is truth in it.

15:41.368 --> 15:42.917
There is.

15:42.953 --> 15:44.419
You can be rigid and deny,

15:44.454 --> 15:47.021
or you can bend a little
and keep your job.

15:47.057 --> 15:48.389
If that lets you keep doing

15:48.441 --> 15:51.409
the things that are important
to you, just bend, Chris.

15:54.231 --> 15:57.615
I wasn't wrong.

15:57.667 --> 16:00.668
I didn't know what happened to Evy.

16:00.704 --> 16:02.120
I can't solve a problem

16:02.155 --> 16:04.272
if a student won't say anything to me.

16:04.307 --> 16:06.841
Well, she said something to me.

16:06.876 --> 16:08.443
What does that tell you?

16:31.785 --> 16:35.470
Mia, Mercy, Daddy's gonna
get you something to eat.

16:36.556 --> 16:38.056
Daddy's gonna go for a little bit.

16:40.377 --> 16:41.626
The reality is, the damage is done.

16:41.678 --> 16:43.711
The school looks culpable and complicit.

16:43.763 --> 16:45.647
Well, w-w-we'll fight this.

16:45.699 --> 16:47.782
Fight it how? The
information's out there.

16:47.817 --> 16:49.417
From here on in, it's
just water torture...

16:49.452 --> 16:51.302
leak by leak.

16:51.304 --> 16:53.104
The board looks reprehensible.

16:53.106 --> 16:56.341
You know, I-I-I look at
all this, and you...

16:56.376 --> 16:59.060
You have managed to keep
yourself out of the dirt.

16:59.095 --> 17:02.113
This is a moment for very
difficult decisions.

17:02.148 --> 17:03.531
You've been the school's

17:03.566 --> 17:05.583
strongest supporter and advocate.

17:05.585 --> 17:08.202
For the school's sake, one more time,

17:08.238 --> 17:11.289
you're going to have to be a leader.

17:11.290 --> 17:13.907
Y-You want me to... to resign?

17:13.943 --> 17:14.892
More than that...

17:14.944 --> 17:16.894
Other members were implicated, as well.

17:16.945 --> 17:19.247
We need to dissolve the entire board

17:19.299 --> 17:21.648
and appoint a trustee
for an interim period.

17:21.685 --> 17:23.718
For the sake of continuity, I
will stay on as headmaster.

17:23.770 --> 17:24.741
W-W-Wait a minute, though...

17:24.766 --> 17:26.845
It's important for the donors
and the families to know

17:26.873 --> 17:30.208
- that although changes are coming...
- You were part of this at every step.

17:30.243 --> 17:32.160
As you noted, Dr. Graham comes across

17:32.195 --> 17:34.212
as unsoiled on the record.

17:34.247 --> 17:36.130
Officially, she lobbied for transparency

17:36.166 --> 17:37.432
with the authorities,

17:37.467 --> 17:39.684
counseling and assistance
for the alleged victim,

17:39.736 --> 17:41.653
and inclusion of an openly gay athlete

17:41.655 --> 17:43.338
on his return to school.

17:43.373 --> 17:44.722
I've put together a transition plan

17:44.758 --> 17:45.890
which I've already distributed

17:45.925 --> 17:48.726
to the parents, donors...

17:48.728 --> 17:49.977
and the press.

17:50.030 --> 17:53.748
Retired Senator Robert Butler
has agreed to act as trustee

17:53.783 --> 17:55.216
and fiduciary caretaker.

17:55.268 --> 17:56.734
He's a respected alumnus,

17:56.770 --> 17:59.687
and the hope is his presence
will calm everyone,

17:59.739 --> 18:03.041
including law enforcement and
state athletic officials.

18:03.043 --> 18:07.362
You must really be taking some
pleasure in this right now.

18:08.648 --> 18:10.581
Change is here because
a student is dead.

18:10.617 --> 18:12.083
You really think that's pleasurable?

18:12.118 --> 18:14.585
- That's not what I meant.
- I know, but the problem is

18:14.637 --> 18:17.839
you and the board consistently
say stupid things.

18:17.874 --> 18:20.358
I simply wasn't stupid.

18:27.150 --> 18:28.950
They're okay alone like that?

18:28.985 --> 18:30.284
Yeah, they're fine.

18:30.320 --> 18:31.869
Yeah, it's easier than
finding a babysitter.

18:31.921 --> 18:35.223
It's a little creepy.

18:35.275 --> 18:37.225
Just a little bit.

18:37.277 --> 18:38.393
Single dad making do.

18:38.428 --> 18:40.495
I mean... you know?

18:40.547 --> 18:43.264
I-It's all good.

18:43.299 --> 18:45.850
Do you work with computers?

18:45.885 --> 18:48.853
Yeah, you ever have anybody
say stuff about you online...

18:48.905 --> 18:50.321
nasty stuff?

18:50.373 --> 18:52.156
People say stuff all the time.

18:52.158 --> 18:53.791
How does that make you feel?

18:53.793 --> 18:56.294
Makes you feel helpless?

18:56.296 --> 18:59.647
When stuff like that happens,
I do something about it.

18:59.682 --> 19:01.065
Like what?

19:02.185 --> 19:03.684
Everybody got things, you know?

19:03.737 --> 19:04.986
Stuff they just want to keep hid,

19:05.021 --> 19:06.604
except it's not hid.

19:06.656 --> 19:08.489
It's... It's on their hard drive,

19:08.525 --> 19:10.274
or it's in an e-mail somewhere.

19:10.276 --> 19:12.243
You hack people?

19:12.278 --> 19:14.278
Isn't that against the law?

19:14.330 --> 19:15.830
Who's to decide that?

19:15.865 --> 19:17.782
Used to be against the
law for blacks to vote.

19:17.834 --> 19:19.083
Gay... Gays couldn't get married.

19:19.119 --> 19:21.619
Okay, that's... that's
not the same thing.

19:21.671 --> 19:23.371
You have my information.

19:23.423 --> 19:25.706
What are you gonna do, hack me one day?

19:25.759 --> 19:28.626
No. You don't get it.

19:28.628 --> 19:31.045
You got all your information online.

19:31.097 --> 19:33.548
You don't know how vulnerable you are.

19:33.600 --> 19:36.551
It's people like me... We're
the ones who protect you.

19:47.716 --> 19:50.433
This information coming out,
it's good for us, right?

19:50.469 --> 19:53.203
That relates to your son's
allegation on sexual assault.

19:53.238 --> 19:55.338
It doesn't really have any
bearing on the shooting.

19:55.374 --> 19:57.407
But they... T-The school forced Taylor

19:57.442 --> 19:59.192
into a bad emotional space.

19:59.244 --> 20:00.293
They did nothing.

20:00.328 --> 20:01.861
They did everything to make us go away.

20:01.897 --> 20:04.147
Taylor got a gun and shot a boy.

20:11.540 --> 20:14.941
I thought you said we needed
to change the narrative.

20:14.976 --> 20:16.309
The facts are the facts.

20:16.344 --> 20:17.994
The best we can hope for
is that he's charged

20:18.046 --> 20:19.462
with involuntary manslaughter,

20:19.514 --> 20:21.364
that it's an accidental killing.

20:21.400 --> 20:23.566
And then we...

20:23.602 --> 20:25.969
That's where we need help,
is in the sentencing phase.

20:25.971 --> 20:28.071
If we can show mitigating
circumstances there...

20:28.106 --> 20:30.607
state of mind or emotional distress...

20:30.642 --> 20:33.343
Taylor might get off lightly,
maybe a 10-year sentence,

20:33.378 --> 20:34.894
and he'll serve half that.

20:34.930 --> 20:38.398
Or he could be institutionalized.

20:38.450 --> 20:41.084
If we can't?

20:41.136 --> 20:42.218
Then...

20:42.270 --> 20:45.004
Just say it.

20:45.040 --> 20:47.490
25, 30 years.

20:47.526 --> 20:49.809
Sebastian, it's Anne. I
talked to my lawyer.

20:49.861 --> 20:53.797
That stuff you put online,
I-it's not doing any good.

20:53.849 --> 20:55.615
Now they know what kind of school it is.

20:55.650 --> 20:57.283
Doesn't help with the shooting.

20:57.319 --> 20:59.636
I need something else.
I-I need more things.

20:59.671 --> 21:01.621
I need... I need something else.

21:01.656 --> 21:02.906
Okay.

21:02.908 --> 21:04.641
I-It has to be more.

21:04.676 --> 21:06.192
You understand?

21:08.447 --> 21:10.597
There's gonna be more. That...

21:10.632 --> 21:12.232
That's just how it starts.

21:12.267 --> 21:13.199
Okay.

21:29.184 --> 21:31.784
The boys are spinning out.

21:31.820 --> 21:34.387
They're lost and bitter,
and I can't help them.

21:36.691 --> 21:40.543
Well, you've done more for
them than they deserve.

21:40.595 --> 21:42.996
And...

21:43.031 --> 21:48.101
I'm telling Eric that, uh...

21:48.153 --> 21:51.020
the school, the team, they're my life.

21:51.056 --> 21:53.356
My family is my life.

21:53.391 --> 21:56.993
And I'm fighting for every part of it.

21:56.995 --> 21:58.728
And that kid, he...

21:58.763 --> 22:01.648
he just stares at me
like he doesn't get it.

22:01.683 --> 22:05.001
Like... Like what matters to me...

22:05.053 --> 22:07.620
doesn't matter.

22:07.656 --> 22:11.407
And, uh... And, y-you know...

22:11.459 --> 22:14.427
you see that in somebody...

22:14.479 --> 22:16.779
It's ugly.

22:16.781 --> 22:18.498
It, uh...

22:18.533 --> 22:20.633
It really hurts.

22:23.755 --> 22:25.522
Anne.

22:25.557 --> 22:29.108
I'm Steph Sullivan, Dan Sullivan's wife.

22:29.144 --> 22:30.777
Where did you get these?

22:30.812 --> 22:32.662
Oh, I take photos for the school.

22:32.714 --> 22:34.964
I-I just thought you'd like them.

22:35.016 --> 22:37.217
Why would I want these?

22:37.252 --> 22:39.569
They're your son.

22:39.604 --> 22:41.337
They're pictures. I have a son.

22:41.389 --> 22:42.839
He's in jail.

22:42.874 --> 22:45.408
Your husband said some very
hurtful things about him.

22:45.410 --> 22:48.294
I don't know what happened
the night of that party

22:48.330 --> 22:51.064
with your son and that other boy.

22:51.099 --> 22:52.815
I know.

22:52.817 --> 22:54.968
I don't.

22:55.003 --> 22:58.605
But I know that...

22:58.640 --> 23:01.841
kids have been hurt.

23:04.813 --> 23:08.565
And it's got to stop.

23:08.600 --> 23:12.235
You know that your son was on drugs

23:12.270 --> 23:14.087
at the time of the shooting.

23:17.826 --> 23:21.010
From what I understand,
Taylor still hasn't said

23:21.012 --> 23:23.146
where he got the drugs from.

23:23.181 --> 23:25.081
Do you know?

23:26.885 --> 23:30.186
My... My husband doesn't
know that I'm here.

23:30.221 --> 23:34.390
I just wanted to talk to you, just...

23:34.426 --> 23:37.360
just one mother to another.

23:40.966 --> 23:44.400
See, our daughter, she's...
she's just like your son.

23:44.436 --> 23:46.619
At... At heart, she's
such a good person.

23:46.671 --> 23:49.772
Your... Your daughter gave him drugs?

23:49.808 --> 23:52.442
She sold drugs to him.

23:52.444 --> 23:55.078
Your daughter messed up my son,

23:55.130 --> 23:56.296
and you want what?

23:56.331 --> 23:58.264
I want you to talk to Taylor

23:58.300 --> 24:01.317
and help me to keep her
from being arrested.

24:01.353 --> 24:04.037
Why would I do that?

24:04.089 --> 24:05.838
It wasn't her fault.

24:08.393 --> 24:09.926
She got them from me.

24:09.961 --> 24:12.378
So you're an addict?
Is that what this is?

24:12.414 --> 24:14.147
It was just marijuana.

24:14.182 --> 24:16.065
They're drugs.

24:16.101 --> 24:18.001
You want to be responsible,
go to the police.

24:18.036 --> 24:20.169
No, I'm trying to protect my daughter,

24:20.205 --> 24:21.454
and you understand that.

24:21.506 --> 24:22.472
I know that you do.

24:22.524 --> 24:23.640
Please leave.

24:23.692 --> 24:25.725
No, I-I'll beg you. Do
you want me to beg?

24:25.777 --> 24:27.193
Get out of my house.

24:41.259 --> 24:45.778
If you force us to, to protect Becca,

24:45.830 --> 24:48.197
she'll testify that she
sold drugs to Taylor

24:48.199 --> 24:51.017
the night of the party and
that he lied to the police

24:51.052 --> 24:53.019
about being drugged by
one of the players.

24:53.054 --> 24:55.655
- That's not true.
- I don't know what's true.

24:57.809 --> 24:59.525
But I know what I'll say.

25:30.646 --> 25:32.529
Chris.

25:35.784 --> 25:40.053
After much thought and reflection,

25:40.088 --> 25:42.155
I see that I was wrong.

25:42.157 --> 25:45.258
I see that I could have
handled the situation

25:45.260 --> 25:49.663
with Mateo Alvarez better, sooner,

25:49.715 --> 25:52.248
and with more sensitivity.

25:52.284 --> 25:53.950
What I did not know at the time

25:53.986 --> 25:57.921
was that the altercation
was not instigated merely

25:57.956 --> 26:01.625
because a male student was
flirting with a female student,

26:01.660 --> 26:05.879
but because that male student had...

26:05.914 --> 26:09.733
had touched a female in
an inappropriate manner.

26:11.570 --> 26:14.938
I believe my judgment was influenced

26:14.973 --> 26:16.840
by the fact that I could not look past

26:16.875 --> 26:20.660
a racial slur directed
by Mateo towards blacks.

26:22.597 --> 26:26.066
Mateo's actions were unwarranted,

26:26.118 --> 26:27.734
but as an administrator,

26:27.736 --> 26:33.156
it was my responsibility
to be more thorough.

26:33.191 --> 26:34.524
I would like the board to know

26:34.576 --> 26:37.844
that I understand my mistakes and...

26:44.269 --> 26:47.320
...and my biases

26:47.322 --> 26:52.108
and will adjust my
responses in the future.

26:52.144 --> 26:55.061
Thank you for that
statement, Principal Dixon.

26:55.113 --> 26:56.963
We appreciate your candor.

26:58.734 --> 27:00.100
We'd like to ask you...

27:00.135 --> 27:03.720
How long was Taylor Blaine
in attendance at Marshall

27:03.755 --> 27:06.272
before he shot another student
at The Leyland School?

27:09.695 --> 27:12.746
I think...

27:12.781 --> 27:15.849
I-I'm not certain. Um...

27:15.884 --> 27:18.351
I can check my records, but I
think it was about a month.

27:18.387 --> 27:21.254
During that period, you were
aware of his situation?

27:21.289 --> 27:24.057
I-I was aware from his mother

27:24.092 --> 27:27.660
that Taylor was involved in
the allegations of assault

27:27.696 --> 27:28.862
at Leyland.

27:28.897 --> 27:31.131
You knew that he was
involved in an assault.

27:31.183 --> 27:32.485
You knew that he had
mental-health issues.

27:32.509 --> 27:33.841
I-I didn't know he had mental-health...

27:33.869 --> 27:35.068
What was your follow-up?

27:35.120 --> 27:37.554
I did not know that he had
mental-health issues.

27:37.606 --> 27:39.439
His mother spoke to you.

27:39.474 --> 27:40.790
You didn't get him into
regular counseling?

27:42.494 --> 27:44.344
What counseling?

27:44.396 --> 27:46.696
You all have cut my budget.

27:46.732 --> 27:50.250
I have one counselor for
almost 2,000 students.

27:50.252 --> 27:52.419
I can't get them all through
mental-health evaluations,

27:52.421 --> 27:55.038
and even if I could, we
can't do regular follow-up.

27:55.073 --> 27:57.924
Did you consider Taylor
Blaine's case extraordinary?

27:57.959 --> 27:59.209
No.

27:59.261 --> 28:01.144
I-I was concerned,

28:01.196 --> 28:02.241
but at the time, as I said...

28:02.265 --> 28:05.764
Leslie Graham, the head of The Leyland
School, gave a statement to the police

28:05.801 --> 28:07.634
that you personally came to visit her

28:07.686 --> 28:10.186
- regarding Taylor Blaine.
- Yes, yes, I-I did.

28:10.238 --> 28:11.793
2,000 students... You
claim you don't have...

28:11.818 --> 28:12.672
T-that's not a claim.

28:12.707 --> 28:15.358
...the budget to follow
up on all of them,

28:15.393 --> 28:18.912
and yet you personally
follow up on Taylor Blaine.

28:18.947 --> 28:21.147
What made him special?

28:21.183 --> 28:22.782
Was it the fact that he's white?

28:32.794 --> 28:35.545
His race didn't matter to me.

28:35.580 --> 28:38.164
You just stood there and admitted bias.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.667
How are you going to say
race doesn't matter?

28:48.343 --> 28:51.111
I really appreciate that you
were willing to be honest and...

28:51.163 --> 28:53.563
Good. Okay.

28:55.350 --> 28:57.667
I've got your appreciation.

29:01.857 --> 29:03.556
Look...

29:03.608 --> 29:05.809
I-I'm not mad at you.

29:08.246 --> 29:11.097
I'm just whipped.

29:12.767 --> 29:15.318
I go in there ready to crawl,

29:15.353 --> 29:16.953
and they hit me up

29:17.005 --> 29:18.571
over something that happened at Leyland.

29:18.607 --> 29:21.274
Nobody cares what blacks and
Hispanics do to each other

29:21.276 --> 29:22.742
- at a public school.
- I care.

29:22.777 --> 29:24.711
But you're on your way out the door.

29:24.713 --> 29:26.262
So what does that matter?

29:26.298 --> 29:29.232
You're a smart man at a
school in transition.

29:29.284 --> 29:30.817
You could have used this situation.

29:30.869 --> 29:34.754
- "Used"?
- For your agenda.

29:34.756 --> 29:36.356
I didn't have one.

29:36.391 --> 29:39.826
Funding for classes,
teachers, counseling...

29:39.861 --> 29:42.128
You didn't want any of that?

29:42.130 --> 29:43.563
Everybody's got an agenda.

29:44.900 --> 29:48.334
Me getting pushed aside... Was
that part of your agenda?

30:09.374 --> 30:11.591
Peter.

30:11.626 --> 30:13.026
Hey.

30:14.863 --> 30:16.763
I need you to come get me.

30:18.300 --> 30:21.134
Are you okay?

30:21.169 --> 30:22.936
It's Mom.

30:22.988 --> 30:27.373
She keeps talking about you
and talking about Dad...

30:27.409 --> 30:31.861
how we're gonna go away and
things are gonna be better.

30:31.897 --> 30:34.731
It's not better.

30:34.766 --> 30:37.750
We don't have any more money.
She spent it all already.

30:42.007 --> 30:43.673
I want to come home.

31:10.185 --> 31:12.318
Why'd you take Peter?

31:12.354 --> 31:13.987
I didn't take him.

31:14.022 --> 31:17.590
He's my son. He needed to be with me.

31:17.626 --> 31:19.692
It just wasn't working.

31:19.728 --> 31:22.428
He got scared of being away from home,

31:22.464 --> 31:24.514
scared of me.

31:24.549 --> 31:27.367
I-I just got tired of it.

31:27.402 --> 31:29.686
Bringing him back seemed
like the best thing.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.938
You gave up.

31:31.973 --> 31:33.056
Your father's got custody.

31:33.108 --> 31:34.607
I wasn't supposed to have Peter anyway.

31:34.609 --> 31:36.542
You were supposed to be here with us.

31:38.430 --> 31:40.096
You gave up on that, too.

31:44.502 --> 31:46.552
You don't know how hard it is...

31:46.588 --> 31:49.238
Having a gay son?

31:49.274 --> 31:52.608
Having all the people at
church whispering about me?

31:52.661 --> 31:54.877
Must be so hard.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.813
This isn't the life I wanted.

31:56.848 --> 32:00.316
I didn't choose this.

32:00.368 --> 32:02.669
But I...

32:02.704 --> 32:03.870
I deal with it.

32:03.872 --> 32:05.888
How do you deal with it?

32:07.175 --> 32:10.526
I see how you act tough all the time.

32:10.562 --> 32:13.896
How you talk about women so
people won't think you're...

32:13.948 --> 32:17.617
You did whatever you did
to that boy at that party.

32:17.652 --> 32:22.722
Curt told me about those random...
dates you go on.

32:22.757 --> 32:25.441
That how you deal with your life?

32:25.477 --> 32:26.726
So I got all that from you.

32:26.728 --> 32:29.579
I got an ex-husband who's nearly broke.

32:29.614 --> 32:31.447
I got no job. I just wanted...

32:31.499 --> 32:32.465
I just...

32:35.337 --> 32:39.005
I just wanted one of my kids.

32:42.344 --> 32:44.027
I don't even have that.

32:56.775 --> 32:58.408
Mom.

33:46.996 --> 33:48.879
I didn't think I was
gonna see you again.

33:50.433 --> 33:52.283
I needed to.

33:52.318 --> 33:55.386
Because?

33:55.421 --> 33:57.672
I need you to tell the truth.

33:59.709 --> 34:02.193
I did.

34:02.228 --> 34:04.495
I do care about you.
I never wanted to...

34:04.530 --> 34:05.880
That's not what I'm talking about.

34:05.882 --> 34:07.765
I don't care about that.

34:07.800 --> 34:11.652
What happened the night of the party?

34:11.688 --> 34:15.956
You lied about being gay.

34:16.009 --> 34:19.860
You lied about taking drugs,

34:19.896 --> 34:22.380
and those texts and e-mails.

34:22.415 --> 34:24.732
I heard you took a
settlement from Leyland.

34:24.766 --> 34:27.368
Y-Yeah, I did.

34:27.370 --> 34:30.237
I took money for my mom and for my dad.

34:30.273 --> 34:32.606
You were protecting your family.
You don't have to defend it.

34:32.659 --> 34:36.226
It's not even about my parents.

34:36.312 --> 34:38.161
It just got the point

34:38.197 --> 34:42.850
where somebody comes along and says...

34:42.885 --> 34:46.587
"That boyfriend who lies to you"...

34:48.524 --> 34:51.342
..."That boyfriend you
keep covering up for"...

34:54.563 --> 34:56.864
"That boyfriend who treats you like..."

35:02.438 --> 35:07.675
"All you got to do is
step back and get paid."

35:07.677 --> 35:10.444
So, I got paid.

35:10.496 --> 35:13.464
I'm taking care of me.

35:14.517 --> 35:17.151
So, what really happened that night?

35:20.723 --> 35:22.473
If you need to know...

35:24.660 --> 35:27.294
...he did it.

35:27.296 --> 35:31.499
I lied a-about a lot, but not that.

35:33.803 --> 35:36.520
What's gonna happen to you now?

35:36.556 --> 35:39.857
I thought you were done with me.

35:39.892 --> 35:41.442
I know you don't care,

35:41.477 --> 35:46.180
but I just went through my own stuff.

35:46.215 --> 35:48.816
Had nobody who'd listen to me.

35:48.818 --> 35:50.651
Couldn't dump it on my parents.

35:50.703 --> 35:55.740
But I found one person who believed me.

35:55.775 --> 35:58.876
Well...

35:58.928 --> 36:01.979
I'm all out of people who believe me.

36:02.031 --> 36:04.999
That's the thing...

36:05.001 --> 36:08.102
I believed in myself.

36:28.191 --> 36:31.025
Mom, I know some things.

36:31.060 --> 36:32.460
About?

36:35.948 --> 36:38.132
I know why Wes got shot.

36:42.238 --> 36:44.505
But I don't know what to do, you know?

36:49.612 --> 36:52.730
You tell me the truth.

36:52.765 --> 36:55.132
That's what you do.

36:55.168 --> 36:57.818
Tell the truth.

36:58.554 --> 37:01.689
It was LeSean who told me.

37:03.042 --> 37:07.444
So, I guess him, Wes,
and a couple of others,

37:07.480 --> 37:12.449
they found Taylor Blaine and
they got physical with him.

37:12.485 --> 37:14.185
They beat him?

37:14.220 --> 37:16.921
Yeah.

37:16.956 --> 37:21.208
Trying to teach him to
be correct, I guess.

37:21.244 --> 37:24.929
Why did they feel they had
to teach him anything?

37:27.183 --> 37:30.367
We were out after a game
one night, and I...

37:30.419 --> 37:33.304
I just kind of went off on him,
you know, on how he's a bitch

37:33.339 --> 37:35.022
and how somebody needed
to put him in his place,

37:35.024 --> 37:39.793
but I never said go beat anybody...
ever.

37:39.846 --> 37:42.112
I just wasn't...

37:42.148 --> 37:45.216
It's the truth. I know it is.

37:47.336 --> 37:50.154
And if it comes to it,
he'll testify to that.

37:50.189 --> 37:52.590
Yeah.

37:52.625 --> 37:54.708
I need to...

37:54.710 --> 37:57.361
I just have to figure out the
best way to handle this.

37:57.396 --> 37:59.747
Yeah, c-can we get a minute?

37:59.799 --> 38:02.049
I-I-I'll be out.

38:02.084 --> 38:03.467
Yeah, just give us a minute.

38:19.135 --> 38:22.286
What do we do?

38:22.321 --> 38:25.472
Could turn it over for investigation.

38:25.508 --> 38:30.311
But people's trust on
any of this, it's done.

38:30.379 --> 38:32.213
Your son implicates himself,

38:32.248 --> 38:34.515
and nobody's gonna care
if he meant what he said

38:34.550 --> 38:36.967
or if he was just thinking out loud.

38:41.107 --> 38:43.958
Kevin confessed.

38:43.993 --> 38:46.043
He got it out.

38:46.095 --> 38:49.230
Probably be good if it ended with that.

39:08.084 --> 39:09.767
I know there are people who think

39:09.802 --> 39:11.702
the kind of stuff I do... It's...

39:11.737 --> 39:16.156
It's against the law. It's...
It's criminal.

39:16.192 --> 39:18.259
Yeah, technically.

39:18.311 --> 39:20.511
But I'm a white hat...

39:20.563 --> 39:21.912
hacking for justice.

39:21.948 --> 39:24.581
What's your relationship
to Taylor Blaine?

39:24.617 --> 39:26.267
I got no relationship.

39:26.302 --> 39:27.601
I followed the case in the media,

39:27.653 --> 39:29.153
and I could see that this kid

39:29.188 --> 39:31.405
and his single mom were
getting railroaded.

39:31.457 --> 39:35.342
That school needed to be called
on it and held accountable.

39:35.344 --> 39:37.278
Know what I'm saying?

39:37.313 --> 39:42.349
You see, that first round,
that was just a warning.

39:42.385 --> 39:44.518
Now things are gonna get serious.

39:44.553 --> 39:46.353
Serious how?

39:46.405 --> 39:48.822
Further devastation for
The Leyland School...

39:48.908 --> 39:53.260
exposing individuals for who
they are and what they did.

39:53.312 --> 39:56.864
Justice for Taylor Blaine.

39:56.866 --> 40:00.784
I told my girls I was
gonna do great things,

40:00.836 --> 40:03.487
and I'm gonna do them.

40:03.522 --> 40:05.306
Yeah.

40:05.358 --> 40:07.992
Pay attention.

40:08.044 --> 40:09.460
You're gonna know me.

40:12.815 --> 40:14.815
Financial and legal repercussions

40:14.817 --> 40:18.035
from the online breach
could be catastrophic.

40:18.070 --> 40:20.454
They expose the school
to potential lawsuits

40:20.506 --> 40:21.955
and jeopardize not only the future

40:21.957 --> 40:23.724
of the school's capital campaign,

40:23.726 --> 40:27.194
but actually threaten the
money we have in hand.

40:27.229 --> 40:28.962
Unless we take immediate action,

40:28.998 --> 40:31.932
The Leyland School is in danger
of having to close its doors.

40:31.967 --> 40:34.802
To mitigate the damages and
to show the wider community

40:34.854 --> 40:39.206
that we understand the breadth
and depth of our missteps,

40:39.241 --> 40:41.625
I advise this board to
vote to dissolve itself,

40:41.677 --> 40:45.129
according to Section 4B,
Paragraph 7 of the Bylaws.

40:52.355 --> 40:54.405
Upon dissolution, the school will go

40:54.440 --> 40:57.024
into receivership under
the care of a trustee

40:57.026 --> 40:58.659
who will oversee all financial matters

40:58.694 --> 41:01.912
under my continuing guidance.

41:01.947 --> 41:03.247
Do I hear a motion to dissolve

41:03.282 --> 41:04.782
the Board of Directors
of The Leyland School

41:04.834 --> 41:08.268
and adopt the Transition
Plan as outlined?

41:11.207 --> 41:12.506
I so move.

41:12.541 --> 41:13.924
Seconded.

41:13.959 --> 41:16.627
All in favor, raise your hand.

41:22.852 --> 41:24.301
Against?

41:30.309 --> 41:33.093
This board is hereby dissolved.
