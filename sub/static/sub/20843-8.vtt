00:01.935 --> 00:03.737
‐ Announcer: <i>Previously...</i>
‐ Service!

00:03.737 --> 00:05.506
<i>a high‐end</i>
<i>breakfast challenge...</i>

00:05.506 --> 00:06.907
Reba:
You're burning your eggs.

00:06.907 --> 00:08.609
<i>left the blue team</i>
<i>scrambled.</i>

00:08.609 --> 00:10.010
Where's my two and two?

00:10.010 --> 00:11.245
<i>And a shocking twist...</i>

00:11.245 --> 00:12.579
Aarón:
You two will have to cook

00:12.579 --> 00:14.948
in a fight for your lives
in this kitchen.

00:14.948 --> 00:16.350
<i>sent Yachecia</i>
<i>and Jennifer...</i>

00:16.350 --> 00:17.518
Gordon:
Fish and chips.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.586
<i>into an intense</i>
<i>pressure test...</i>

00:19.586 --> 00:21.088
That is not
your best performance.

00:21.088 --> 00:22.990
<i>that proved too difficult</i>
<i>for Jennifer.</i>

00:22.990 --> 00:24.157
Gordon:
Gonna miss you, Jennifer.

00:24.157 --> 00:26.994
<i>ending her "MasterChef"</i>
<i>journey.</i>

00:28.662 --> 00:29.997
‐ <i>Tonight...</i>
‐ Christina: Please welcome...

00:29.997 --> 00:32.799
‐ ( lowing )
‐ ...Daisy the cow!

00:32.799 --> 00:34.701
Daisy looks like she needs
milking really bad.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.803
<i>it's a mystery box</i>
<i>challenge...</i>

00:36.803 --> 00:37.971
( chuckles )

00:37.971 --> 00:39.773
<i>that requires</i>
<i>"udder" perfection.</i>

00:39.773 --> 00:41.708
‐ Very nice job.
‐ Gordon: It's delicious.

00:41.708 --> 00:42.876
It's one of the best things
you've cooked.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.611
‐ <i>And then...</i>
‐ Oh, my God...

00:44.611 --> 00:47.381
<i>the "steaks" are higher</i>
<i>than ever before,</i>

00:47.381 --> 00:50.717
‐ <i>as an elimination test...</i>
‐ Gordon: Speed up, guys!
Let's go.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.986
<i>leads to a performance</i>
<i>so shocking...</i>

00:52.986 --> 00:54.388
I'm confused.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.689
I don't understand
what's going on.

00:55.689 --> 00:59.059
<i>it leaves the judges</i>
<i>speechless.</i>

01:09.670 --> 01:11.271
Whoo!

01:11.271 --> 01:12.472
Top 15!

01:12.472 --> 01:14.508
It's just amazing
to be in the top 15.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.777
Here we go.
We're feeling good.

01:16.777 --> 01:19.146
But at the same time,
I've been kind of riding
in the middle,

01:19.146 --> 01:20.480
and now it's time
that I have to

01:20.480 --> 01:21.782
<i>put the iron to the horse</i>

01:21.782 --> 01:22.983
and get to
the front of the pack.

01:22.983 --> 01:25.152
‐ Line up! Welcome.
‐ Yes!

01:25.152 --> 01:26.153
Gordon:
Let's go.

01:26.153 --> 01:27.988
I'm a preacher
from Detroit,

01:27.988 --> 01:31.158
<i>and one day I want to open up</i>
<i>a nice little small bistro,</i>

01:31.158 --> 01:33.961
and then once a month,
I want to bring in
homeless people,

01:33.961 --> 01:37.497
and be able to serve them
a beautiful home‐cooked meal.

01:37.497 --> 01:40.133
I am ready to make
my culinary dream come true.

01:40.133 --> 01:44.171
Welcome back
to the MasterChef kitchen.

01:44.171 --> 01:46.707
Only one of you will be leaving
here with the ultimate prize:

01:46.707 --> 01:48.709
a quarter of
a million dollars

01:48.709 --> 01:52.646
and a guaranteed spot
on the next MasterChef cruise,

01:52.646 --> 01:54.848
and the title of MasterChef.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.316
Before we get started,

01:56.316 --> 01:59.286
we've a very special
guest joining us.

02:02.089 --> 02:03.423
The blinds
are going up.

02:03.423 --> 02:05.459
Oh, my God.

02:05.459 --> 02:08.261
"MasterChef" is always
bringing in the top‐tier chefs

02:08.261 --> 02:11.264
<i>throughout the world,</i>
<i>but I don't know who it is.</i>

02:11.264 --> 02:13.567
Who's gonna be coming out
behind that door?

02:13.567 --> 02:16.670
Christina:
Please welcome...

02:22.843 --> 02:24.411
( lowing )

02:24.411 --> 02:27.447
( laughter )

02:27.447 --> 02:31.785
‐ Daisy the cow!
‐ I want him!

02:34.688 --> 02:36.356
All of you say
a good evening

02:36.356 --> 02:40.260
to this giant
of the culinary world, Daisy.

02:40.260 --> 02:41.662
‐ Newton: Hey, Daisy.
‐ ( applause )

02:41.662 --> 02:42.996
Now, American cattle
produce about

02:42.996 --> 02:46.433
24 billion pounds
of beef every year.

02:46.433 --> 02:49.970
And not to mention
the nine million dairy cows
like Daisy,

02:49.970 --> 02:51.338
who every day are
producing staples

02:51.338 --> 02:55.375
like incredible butter,
cheeses, and of course, milk.

02:55.375 --> 02:58.879
Now, so many incredible cuts
come from this cow.

02:58.879 --> 03:01.782
You know the strip loin
backs on to the rib eye.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.084
Tucked underneath
that sirloin, of course,

03:04.084 --> 03:05.886
you've got
an amazing filet.

03:05.886 --> 03:08.388
The chuck, the short ribs,

03:08.388 --> 03:11.558
and then of course,
if Daisy was a David,

03:11.558 --> 03:16.997
under that sac are
two huge, delicious,

03:16.997 --> 03:19.166
testicles.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.601
‐ ( laughs )
‐ Gordon: Now,
let's go, baby.

03:21.601 --> 03:23.837
‐ ( smooching )
‐ Cate: Bye, Daisy!

03:23.837 --> 03:26.573
‐ Adam: Oh, my gosh.
‐ Newton: Bye, Daisy.

03:28.675 --> 03:31.678
Now it's time to begin
your next mystery box challenge.

03:35.348 --> 03:36.583
Oh, snap.

03:40.187 --> 03:43.623
Each one of these boxes
has inside one ingredient

03:43.623 --> 03:45.258
that comes from a cow.

03:45.258 --> 03:48.462
Each of you's gonna come up
and grab a box at random.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.797
Whatever ingredient you find
in that little mystery box,

03:50.797 --> 03:53.767
that needs to be
the star of your dish.

03:53.767 --> 03:57.104
Jason:
<i>There is a lot riding on</i>
<i>this one little mystery box,</i>

03:57.104 --> 04:00.040
<i>but at the same time,</i>
<i>this is a perfect opportunity</i>

04:00.040 --> 04:03.243
to show the judges that I am
well‐rounded in all areas

04:03.243 --> 04:05.779
and that I deserve
to be here.

04:05.779 --> 04:09.082
Gordon:
As you can see,
there is one box left,

04:09.082 --> 04:12.252
entirely at random.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.988
We'll worry about
this one later.

04:16.623 --> 04:19.226
Now the person
with the best dish
in this mystery box challenge

04:19.226 --> 04:21.328
will get
the biggest advantage

04:21.328 --> 04:23.497
in the competition
so far.

04:23.497 --> 04:26.733
Christina:
It's time to find out what's
inside your mystery boxes.

04:26.733 --> 04:28.135
‐ All right.
‐ One.

04:28.135 --> 04:30.837
‐ ( mutters )
‐ Two.

04:30.837 --> 04:32.472
Three. Lift.

04:41.648 --> 04:43.750
Each one of you has
a different ingredient

04:43.750 --> 04:46.019
that comes to us
courtesy of a cow,

04:46.019 --> 04:48.155
and not necessarily
all meat.

04:48.155 --> 04:50.357
Oh, awesome.

04:50.357 --> 04:51.625
Aarón:
You guys will have 60 minutes

04:51.625 --> 04:53.093
to make us
an incredible dish

04:53.093 --> 04:55.762
using whatever you have
right in front of you.

04:55.762 --> 04:57.297
As always in
a mystery box challenge,

04:57.297 --> 05:00.300
you will have access
to a staple pantry box.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.270
Gordon:
Additionally, we'll be
giving you access

05:03.270 --> 05:06.706
<i>to the most beautiful pantry</i>
<i>in the entire world.</i>

05:06.706 --> 05:07.908
Aarón:
<i>All right,</i>
<i>is everyone ready?</i>

05:07.908 --> 05:09.109
Your 60 minutes

05:09.109 --> 05:12.279
starts now.

05:12.279 --> 05:14.047
Daniel: All right,
let's go, let's go, guys.

05:15.215 --> 05:16.750
All right,
where these baskets at?

05:16.750 --> 05:18.718
‐ Ooh.
‐ Yeah, baby.

05:18.718 --> 05:21.221
I'm nervous.
I got kidneys, man.

05:21.221 --> 05:23.557
‐ Least you don't got
balls like me.
‐ ( chuckles )

05:23.557 --> 05:27.060
Gabriel:
<i>Out of anything I could have</i>
<i>picked, I have kidneys.</i>

05:27.060 --> 05:28.929
I've never worked with kidneys,
I've never seen kidneys.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.730
I've never eaten the kidneys.

05:30.730 --> 05:34.167
<i>So I'm just grabbing</i>
<i>anything I know that pairs</i>
<i>well with beef.</i>

05:34.167 --> 05:36.303
<i>I really want</i>
<i>to show the judges</i>
<i>that I can deliver a dish</i>

05:36.303 --> 05:37.737
that looks like something
I would want to eat,

05:37.737 --> 05:39.940
and I don't even eat meat.

05:39.940 --> 05:43.009
Um, so I'm gonna do
a Vietnamese‐style
flank steak

05:43.009 --> 05:45.345
with some herb salad
and also a little slaw.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.014
I'm making this dish because
when I was growing up

05:48.014 --> 05:49.749
my mom cooked
flank steak like this,

05:49.749 --> 05:51.318
so I'm going
to try recreating that

05:51.318 --> 05:52.586
and see if I can put
my own spin on it.

05:52.586 --> 05:55.188
Ugh.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.825
I am making a morel
and porcini rub ribeye,

05:58.825 --> 06:01.962
and I'm gonna finish it off
with a little sauté
of wild mushrooms.

06:01.962 --> 06:04.064
After we go turkey hunting
in my family,

06:04.064 --> 06:05.932
we always go mushroom
hunting after,

06:05.932 --> 06:08.869
so I'm taking this
back home today.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.105
Top 15.
They've been through it.

06:12.105 --> 06:15.909
Are they gonna rise
to the occasion and
really nail these dishes?

06:15.909 --> 06:18.979
Now each of these cuts is
different products of the cow.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.914
Which cut would you
love to cook with tonight?

06:20.914 --> 06:22.482
Gordon:
The filet.
A chef's dream.

06:22.482 --> 06:24.551
There's not a restaurant
anywhere in the country

06:24.551 --> 06:25.952
that doesn't feature
filet mignon.

06:25.952 --> 06:28.788
For me, I guess it would have
to be the beef testicles.

06:28.788 --> 06:31.591
Shockingly enough,
the actual testicle's
a delicacy.

06:31.591 --> 06:33.293
Gordon:
We want to see
those cuts elevated

06:33.293 --> 06:36.329
to restaurant‐quality,
MasterChef‐worthy dishes.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.566
Necco, I love you.
Keep going.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.968
So I got beef tongue today.

06:41.968 --> 06:44.004
I've never worked
with it before.

06:44.004 --> 06:47.140
What I'm gonna do
is make a nice little
sauce vierge today.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.809
Then we're gonna braise it,
put it on top of that

06:49.809 --> 06:51.311
with some
pickled vegetables,

06:51.311 --> 06:54.314
and then top with
a little bit of chili oil
to give it some spice.

06:54.314 --> 06:55.582
I know
that I can elevate it,

06:55.582 --> 06:57.951
and, uh, I'm confident.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.757
‐ Right, Newton.
‐ Yes, sir.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.458
Now, what are you doing
with this porterhouse?

07:05.458 --> 07:07.928
I've seasoned it
with mustard seed,
a little bit of clove,

07:07.928 --> 07:09.763
a little coriander,
a little bit of paprika,

07:09.763 --> 07:11.097
and then a fleur de sel.

07:11.097 --> 07:14.034
And then I will serve it
with a red onion marmalade.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.102
You need to bounce back,
young man.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.571
You need to come back
like you started
this competition.

07:18.571 --> 07:20.240
If I don't
get this right,

07:20.240 --> 07:22.142
I'm gonna change clothes,
change disguise,

07:22.142 --> 07:23.410
and move away from Texas,
to be honest.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.245
Yes. Good luck.

07:26.579 --> 07:27.948
Brien O'Brien,
what's your ingredient?

07:27.948 --> 07:29.649
I got the chuck roast
today, Chef.

07:29.649 --> 07:31.418
It's been a while
since I've cooked
a chuck roast,

07:31.418 --> 07:32.919
but I think
I can nail it.

07:32.919 --> 07:34.821
I'm gonna do cubes
of stewed chuck roast,

07:34.821 --> 07:36.589
I'm gonna do
a cauliflower purée,

07:36.589 --> 07:39.259
and a fresh frisée salad
with honey mustard.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.661
Since your last
mystery box win,

07:41.661 --> 07:43.330
you've kind of fallen flat.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.598
Is this dish gonna be
big enough to impress us?

07:45.598 --> 07:49.169
Absolutely, Chef.
I aim to come back strong.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.270
‐ Good luck.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.272
30 minutes remaining!

07:52.272 --> 07:53.340
‐ Eboni.
‐ Yes, Chef.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.809
‐ Testicles.
‐ Yeah!

07:55.809 --> 07:57.644
How you cooking them?
Where you going with it?

07:57.644 --> 08:00.613
I'm gonna do something
called a Rocky Mountain
soul roast.

08:00.613 --> 08:02.682
I'm gonna fry 'em.
I'm gonna put 'em inside

08:02.682 --> 08:06.052
an egg roll shell
with macaroni and cheese
and greens,

08:06.052 --> 08:07.554
and then make
a spicy sauce for it.

08:07.554 --> 08:09.723
Who taught you how
to cook testicles
like this?

08:09.723 --> 08:11.358
My husband's grandmother.

08:11.358 --> 08:13.560
She invites me over when
she cooks a different dish,

08:13.560 --> 08:15.595
and she'll cook it and say,
"Hey, you want to learn
how to make it?"

08:15.595 --> 08:16.963
I'll go, "Yeah,"
and then we'll go from there.

08:16.963 --> 08:18.698
‐ ( laughs )
‐ Good luck.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.568
‐ Jeff.
‐ Hello.

08:21.568 --> 08:23.069
What cut are you
cooking with tonight?

08:23.069 --> 08:24.304
Going with a skirt
steak over here.

08:24.304 --> 08:25.772
We got a chili‐espresso rub,

08:25.772 --> 08:27.107
Mexican‐style street corn,

08:27.107 --> 08:28.875
with the sweet potato hash.

08:28.875 --> 08:31.978
Back home in Tampa,
I love entertaining people,

08:31.978 --> 08:34.881
and this is a dish
that I've done for
family and friends,

08:34.881 --> 08:37.217
so I think I can be able to
duplicate that again here.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.452
‐ Jeff, good luck.
‐ Thank you so much.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.124
Wow, it smells incredible.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.625
Yep. A lot of really
great flavors.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.727
Gordon:
Newton is doing
this incredible rub.

08:47.727 --> 08:49.129
He's in his element,
let me tell you.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.563
How can he not be
with that porterhouse?

08:50.563 --> 08:53.166
Now Brien O'Brien's
got the chuck roast,

08:53.166 --> 08:56.403
and he's going to cut that
into a beautiful chuck stew.

08:56.403 --> 08:59.839
I think that's
an elegant, rustic way
to approach that.

09:01.775 --> 09:04.677
60 seconds remaining.

09:04.677 --> 09:10.116
Remember, a huge,
game‐changing advantage
for one of you.

09:10.116 --> 09:13.253
15 seconds remaining.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.221
‐ Gordon: Ten...
‐ Judges: Nine...

09:15.221 --> 09:17.590
eight, seven, six,

09:17.590 --> 09:20.360
five, four, three,

09:20.360 --> 09:22.362
two, one.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.764
‐ Gordon: And stop!
‐ Christina: Hands in the air!

09:24.764 --> 09:27.033
Aarón:
Good job, guys. Good job.

09:33.473 --> 09:35.041
Gordon:
Elevate your protein

09:35.041 --> 09:38.878
and let those steaks
be the hero.

09:38.878 --> 09:41.314
Judges:
Five, four, three,

09:41.314 --> 09:42.982
two, one.

09:42.982 --> 09:45.952
‐ Gordon: And stop!
‐ Christina: Hands in the air!

09:45.952 --> 09:47.454
Aarón:
Good job, guys. Good job.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.826
As you know,
across these 60 minutes,

09:52.826 --> 09:57.397
we watched and tasted
everything you were doing.

09:57.397 --> 10:00.100
Tonight, there were
three dishes

10:00.100 --> 10:03.002
that we'd like to take
a much closer look at.

10:03.002 --> 10:08.441
This individual,
they were the recipient
of a much‐favored cut.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.810
There are so many elements
on this plate

10:10.810 --> 10:12.946
working with great harmony.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.081
First up, Newton.
Head on up here, let's go.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.418
Newton:
<i>This old rancher from Texas</i>

10:18.418 --> 10:21.754
just rode his horse
all the way in to
the top three.

10:21.754 --> 10:22.956
<i>I'm like</i>
<i>an old locomotive.</i>

10:22.956 --> 10:24.290
<i>I'm a little slow</i>
<i>to get started,</i>

10:24.290 --> 10:26.359
<i>but it's gonna be</i>
<i>hard as hell to stop me.</i>

10:27.827 --> 10:30.330
Right, cowboy,
describe the dish, please.

10:30.330 --> 10:34.667
I made an aromatic
herb‐crusted porterhouse

10:34.667 --> 10:37.537
finished off
with a little bit of lemon
and a compound butter.

10:37.537 --> 10:42.976
Then as a side item,
we did a red onion chipotle
jalapeño marmalade,

10:42.976 --> 10:45.278
braised greens
with a little smoky flavor,

10:45.278 --> 10:49.349
and then underneath the steak
we did a chipotle
mashed potatoes.

10:49.349 --> 10:50.550
Man, that's
a cowboy's dinner.

10:50.550 --> 10:51.684
It is.

10:51.684 --> 10:53.653
I wanted the steak
to speak for itself,

10:53.653 --> 10:57.023
and be me, personally me,
presented on this plate.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.293
What do I love?
The color,

11:00.293 --> 11:01.995
the glistening
of this porterhouse.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.429
What was the seasoning
on top?

11:03.429 --> 11:06.566
It was mustard seed,
coriander seed,

11:06.566 --> 11:08.835
smoked paprika,
black pepper,

11:08.835 --> 11:10.470
and just a little bit
of clove.

11:10.470 --> 11:13.106
The porterhouse
is delicious.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.508
Absolutely spot‐on.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.010
The caramelization's
beautiful,

11:17.010 --> 11:19.846
really nice
caramelized onions,

11:19.846 --> 11:23.349
nice shiny, silky texture.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.185
The only problem
I have with this dish

11:25.185 --> 11:29.022
is that the 14 people
standing behind you

11:29.022 --> 11:32.192
can't taste
how delicious it is.

11:32.192 --> 11:36.529
This is finally you
at your best.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.865
‐ Welcome back, cowboy.
‐ Thank you.

11:41.434 --> 11:44.204
Newton, how do you typically
cook your steak at home?

11:44.204 --> 11:46.773
You know, I cook mine
rare to medium rare.

11:46.773 --> 11:48.441
Bust the horns off,
wipe its rear end,

11:48.441 --> 11:50.443
and run it through
a brush fire.

11:55.381 --> 11:58.785
Man, I think it's
such a smart dish.

11:58.785 --> 12:01.487
The steak is the star.
You get that earthy heat

12:01.487 --> 12:03.323
from your chipotle
mashed potatoes.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.292
That Swiss chard,
it has an earthiness to it,
but a sweetness,

12:06.292 --> 12:08.595
and that plugs
right into the heat.

12:08.595 --> 12:10.897
What would I
do differently?

12:10.897 --> 12:12.632
Maybe in
the presentation end,

12:12.632 --> 12:15.001
make it feel less
like steak plus three,

12:15.001 --> 12:17.003
but very nice job.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.404
Thank you.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.807
Cate:
Good job, Newton!
Whoo hoo!

12:24.077 --> 12:25.745
The second dish that
we'd like to examine further

12:25.745 --> 12:28.781
is from a home cook
who's already established
himself

12:28.781 --> 12:30.817
as a force
in this kitchen.

12:30.817 --> 12:33.086
This home cook elevated
a humble cut of meat

12:33.086 --> 12:34.854
and made something
spectacular with it.

12:34.854 --> 12:36.756
Please step forward...

12:38.758 --> 12:40.493
Jeff.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.662
Jeff:
<i>Yes. I feel great.</i>

12:42.662 --> 12:46.099
This is now my second time
being in the top three,

12:46.099 --> 12:49.469
and it shows everybody else
that I'm still a threat

12:49.469 --> 12:52.839
<i>and I can become</i>
<i>America's next MasterChef.</i>

12:54.641 --> 12:56.643
Explain to me a little bit
what you got going on
here, buddy.

12:56.643 --> 13:00.179
So I have for you
a chili‐espresso rub
skirt steak,

13:00.179 --> 13:03.383
with a sweet potato
and pepper quartet,

13:03.383 --> 13:06.486
a charred tomatillo,
a poblano salsa verde,

13:06.486 --> 13:08.921
and my take on
a Mexican‐style street corn.

13:08.921 --> 13:10.490
I love the composition
of the dish.

13:10.490 --> 13:13.426
The hash and the salsa
and the corn,

13:13.426 --> 13:14.727
this is inviting.

13:14.727 --> 13:16.062
Now talk to me
about that corn.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.997
I kept the husk on,
'cause that was always

13:17.997 --> 13:19.599
the way my dad
always did it.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.100
As a little boy,
that was always a treat

13:21.100 --> 13:22.602
was to always get
that little bit of a note

13:22.602 --> 13:24.270
of the grill
coming off of it.

13:24.270 --> 13:27.740
That steak right there is
beautiful and medium rare.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.442
That's the way you should
have skirt steak.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.082
The steak tastes
fantastic.

13:36.082 --> 13:39.319
It's rich,
it's seasoned properly.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.754
The salsa itself,
it's bold.

13:41.754 --> 13:44.123
It's rustic.
You left it chunky,
which I like.

13:44.123 --> 13:45.692
The fact that you roasted
all the peppers,

13:45.692 --> 13:48.328
they're coming through,
but they're not overpowering.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.029
The corn is
a little bit underdone.

13:50.029 --> 13:51.597
I do like the flavor of it,

13:51.597 --> 13:55.101
so you nailed it
as far as the accuracy
on the seasoning.

13:55.101 --> 13:57.537
But that steak
right there? Mmm!

13:57.537 --> 13:59.138
‐ Dynamite.
‐ Thank you.

14:03.109 --> 14:05.611
Why the coffee‐chili?

14:05.611 --> 14:07.780
Just to bring a little bit
of depth to it.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.549
Always brings out a little bit
of a smokiness to it there,

14:09.549 --> 14:12.819
a little bit of the sweet
coffee flavors, if you will.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.554
Here's the thing.
It's cooked beautifully.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.823
You've respected the cut.

14:16.823 --> 14:20.760
The temperature, heat,
acidity, the texture‐‐
you've nailed.

14:20.760 --> 14:23.663
Salsa's nice.
Got a vibrancy in that,
an excitement.

14:23.663 --> 14:25.264
Corn's slightly
undercooked,

14:25.264 --> 14:28.601
but I think it's one
of the best things
you've cooked.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.503
‐ It's a good dish.
‐ Thank you.

14:36.576 --> 14:39.078
All right, the third
and final choice.

14:39.078 --> 14:42.115
This home cook was able
to create a plate

14:42.115 --> 14:46.185
that is really packed
with flavor.

14:46.185 --> 14:49.021
Please bring up your dish,
Brien O'Brien.

14:49.021 --> 14:51.524
‐ Good job, bro.
‐ Yes!

14:51.524 --> 14:53.159
<i>Of course, it's me.</i>

14:53.159 --> 14:54.761
I know I deserve it
because my dish

14:54.761 --> 14:56.496
is beautiful and decadent,

14:56.496 --> 14:58.831
<i>and all the dishes around me</i>
<i>don't even compare.</i>

15:00.032 --> 15:02.602
Brien O'Brien,
what'd you make?

15:02.602 --> 15:05.438
Today I made
a braised chuck roast

15:05.438 --> 15:07.807
with a red wine
reduction glaze,

15:07.807 --> 15:11.544
a cauliflower purée,
and a fresh frisée salad.

15:11.544 --> 15:14.547
To be properly braised,
that really means that
that cooking liquid

15:14.547 --> 15:17.784
is really going
to have to have permeated
the entire roast.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.120
And what did you season
that cauliflower purée with?

15:21.120 --> 15:22.555
Wanted it to be
pretty straightforward.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.323
Just a little butter,
a little heavy whipping cream,

15:24.323 --> 15:25.725
and, uh, salt.

15:28.995 --> 15:30.763
It's tender, it's flavorful.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.166
It's so juicy
in the middle.

15:33.166 --> 15:37.804
I mean, look at that.
You can see how the glaze
has permeated down.

15:37.804 --> 15:40.773
I think the cauliflower purée
is a super smart pairing,

15:40.773 --> 15:43.109
because you want
the lightness of
the cauliflower purée

15:43.109 --> 15:47.113
when you have the sort
of stewed meat nature
of the chuck roast.

15:47.113 --> 15:50.316
That frisée salad brings
a very fresh element,

15:50.316 --> 15:51.918
but I think
the cherry tomatoes

15:51.918 --> 15:53.453
bring a sweetness
that you don't want.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.355
I think you only
want the sweetness
in the glaze here.

15:56.355 --> 15:59.792
But I appreciate the approach
between heavier and lighter.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.094
‐ Impressive dish.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.599
Is this something that
you love to cook at home?

16:06.599 --> 16:08.568
My brother called me over
to watch football one day,

16:08.568 --> 16:11.270
and he said, "I got two big
steaks for you to grill
when you get here."

16:11.270 --> 16:13.406
Turns out they were
chuck roasts.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.408
And I, you know, made some
failures with that meat,

16:15.408 --> 16:18.711
so I knew I needed to tenderize
that tough piece of meat.

16:18.711 --> 16:21.380
You know what?
The chuck roast, it's bold.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.049
I think it has
a great amount of heat.

16:23.049 --> 16:25.284
The color I really love.

16:25.284 --> 16:27.320
That cauliflower purée,
it's a really great relief.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.388
It's rich, and it really
helps kind of mellow out

16:29.388 --> 16:30.823
some of the heat
from the rub.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.226
But the presentation
was kind of clunky.

16:33.226 --> 16:36.095
The chuck roast
is a very hard beef
to manipulate

16:36.095 --> 16:38.231
and get tender
and you did that.

16:38.231 --> 16:39.499
Thank you, Chef.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.402
‐ Nice job.
‐ Nice job.

16:43.402 --> 16:45.071
Nice job.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.574
Each and every one of you

16:48.574 --> 16:50.276
highlighted your culinary
styles tonight.

16:50.276 --> 16:52.011
So well done, gentlemen.

16:52.011 --> 16:55.982
But there can only be
one winner of this
mystery box challenge.

16:55.982 --> 16:58.017
It's a home cook that's
gonna get a huge advantage.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.921
Tonight's winning
home cook is...

17:11.030 --> 17:13.799
There can only be
one winner of this
mystery box challenge.

17:13.799 --> 17:16.469
It's a home cook that's
gonna get a huge advantage.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.037
Tonight's winning
home cook is...

17:21.140 --> 17:23.576
‐ Newton. Great job.
‐ Yeah, Netwon!

17:23.576 --> 17:25.411
Please, come
and stand up here.

17:25.411 --> 17:26.879
It's kind of
a euphoric moment

17:26.879 --> 17:29.448
<i>that I get to be the number one</i>
<i>out of the top three.</i>

17:29.448 --> 17:32.251
All right, everyone,
please, all of you,
come down to the front.

17:32.251 --> 17:34.153
<i>These young kids,</i>
<i>they'd better watch out.</i>

17:34.153 --> 17:35.488
<i>They'd better cinch up</i>
<i>their belts,</i>

17:35.488 --> 17:36.722
<i>tighten it up,</i>

17:36.722 --> 17:38.124
<i>because they got</i>
<i>a competitor here,</i>

17:38.124 --> 17:39.492
and I'm gonna
kick their ass.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.995
Finally, you are starting
to emerge.

17:42.995 --> 17:46.966
Now, because you won
the mystery box challenge,

17:46.966 --> 17:49.635
you are safe and you
do not have to compete

17:49.635 --> 17:50.903
in the elimination challenge.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.572
‐ Congratulations.
‐ Thank you.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.274
You'll have
a huge advantage.

17:55.274 --> 17:58.344
14 home cooks
stand before us,

17:58.344 --> 18:01.280
but some of them
will also be spared

18:01.280 --> 18:03.082
from elimination tonight.

18:03.082 --> 18:07.019
And who that is
is up to you, Newton.

18:07.019 --> 18:08.955
Aarón:
We're gonna ask you
to separate

18:08.955 --> 18:12.458
these 14 home cooks
into two groups:

18:12.458 --> 18:15.928
the seven strongest,
and the seven weakest.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.264
Let's start
with the weakest.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.366
Who do you think
the weakest cook is here?

18:23.269 --> 18:25.104
Jenny.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.973
Gordon:
Right, Jenny.
First choice, why?

18:26.973 --> 18:29.575
‐ Lack of self‐confidence.
‐ Interesting.

18:29.575 --> 18:31.043
Jenny:
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

18:31.043 --> 18:33.446
<i>It's insulting being</i>
<i>called one of the weakest.</i>

18:33.446 --> 18:36.549
Whatever.
At this point, it's just
more fuel to my fire,

18:36.549 --> 18:39.218
<i>and I am not going out</i>
<i>without a fight.</i>

18:39.218 --> 18:41.587
Second choice.

18:41.587 --> 18:43.623
‐ Caitlin.
‐ Wow.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.993
Why do you see Caitlin
in the bottom seven?

18:46.993 --> 18:49.762
I think just inexperience.

18:49.762 --> 18:51.931
Wow, Newton thinks
I'm one of the weakest

18:51.931 --> 18:53.966
home cooks
in this competition.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.968
You know what?
I'm perfectly cool with that,

18:55.968 --> 18:58.270
because I know how strong
of a home cook I am,

18:58.270 --> 19:01.374
<i>and it's the judges' opinion</i>
<i>that matters to me.</i>

19:01.374 --> 19:03.876
‐ The third choice.
‐ Dino.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.545
Quite frankly,
I know who performs
and who doesn't perform.

19:06.545 --> 19:08.447
‐ Who's your fourth weakest?
‐ Reba.

19:08.447 --> 19:10.549
‐ Wow.
‐ <i>I have no qualms doing this.</i>

19:10.549 --> 19:11.784
This is competition.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.786
‐ Adam.
‐ Interesting.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.221
Daniel.

19:15.221 --> 19:16.455
And if someone
takes it personal,

19:16.455 --> 19:18.057
then strike me off
your Christmas card list.

19:18.057 --> 19:21.027
You've got one more
that you consider to be

19:21.027 --> 19:24.230
the final individual
in the weakest seven
in this competition.

19:24.230 --> 19:25.231
Who's that person?

19:26.799 --> 19:28.234
‐ Brien.
‐ Wow.

19:28.234 --> 19:30.102
He's missing a little bit
of that finesse

19:30.102 --> 19:32.071
to take 'em to where
they need to be.

19:32.071 --> 19:34.273
It's comical
that Newton thinks
I'm in the bottom seven.

19:34.273 --> 19:36.075
<i>He knows I'm one</i>
<i>of the best chefs here.</i>

19:36.075 --> 19:38.711
He might be trying
to get in my head.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.046
Please, all of you,
come and stand over here.

19:40.046 --> 19:41.914
Line up, please.
Thank you.

19:41.914 --> 19:44.083
So, according
to Newton tonight,

19:44.083 --> 19:46.419
you seven are the weakest.

19:46.419 --> 19:50.756
We've also discovered
who Newton thinks
are the strongest‐‐

19:50.756 --> 19:54.627
Cate, Jeff, Necco,
Eboni, Jason,

19:54.627 --> 19:56.896
Yachecia, and Gabriel.

19:56.896 --> 20:00.833
Newton, you are
about to receive
an incredible advantage.

20:00.833 --> 20:04.904
All 14 of your fellow
home cooks' fate
is in your hands.

20:04.904 --> 20:08.774
You will either save
the seven weakest individuals

20:08.774 --> 20:14.780
or the seven strongest
from tonight's grueling
elimination.

20:14.780 --> 20:17.316
So, Newton, who do you
want to see cooking

20:17.316 --> 20:19.919
in tonight's
elimination challenge?

20:21.353 --> 20:23.522
I want to choose...

20:23.522 --> 20:27.193
the strongest competition
to duke it out.

20:27.193 --> 20:30.029
So that means
the seven weakest home cooks,
by Newton's assessment,

20:30.029 --> 20:32.031
you're all safe
from elimination tonight.

20:32.031 --> 20:34.366
You can all head up
to the balcony with Newton.

20:34.366 --> 20:36.435
Thank you, Chef.

20:36.435 --> 20:38.537
Eboni:
<i>Newton's gunning for me,</i>
<i>but you know what?</i>

20:38.537 --> 20:40.506
You can't get rid of me.

20:40.506 --> 20:42.708
I'm like a fly on ( bleep ).

20:42.708 --> 20:45.678
<i>I'm not going nowhere.</i>

20:45.678 --> 20:48.114
Now earlier tonight,
you all attempted to honor

20:48.114 --> 20:51.550
incredible ingredients
that came from a cow.

20:51.550 --> 20:54.019
We saw 15 of them
earlier tonight.

20:54.019 --> 20:57.123
But one box remained
at random.

20:57.123 --> 20:58.357
Yep.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.796
Whatever part of the cow
is inside here,

21:03.796 --> 21:05.998
is what all of you will
have to cook with tonight.

21:08.968 --> 21:12.104
It is hanger steak.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.140
It's a very prized cut,
but very temperamental.

21:14.140 --> 21:17.476
Cook it the wrong way,
and it's chewy, inedible,

21:17.476 --> 21:21.847
and you've just destroyed
one of the most prized
assets of the cow.

21:21.847 --> 21:23.349
Now, tonight,
you'll just have one hour

21:23.349 --> 21:26.418
to make us an incredible
hanger steak dish.

21:26.418 --> 21:28.487
‐ Now, everybody ready?
‐ Yes, Chef.

21:28.487 --> 21:32.925
Your 60 minutes starts now.
Let's go.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.460
Necco:
Shop smart, guys.
Shop smart.

21:37.496 --> 21:41.033
‐ Okay, what am I doing?
‐ I got red onions.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.601
Being from Oklahoma,
we have a lot of cows.

21:42.601 --> 21:44.336
<i>But I don't eat</i>
<i>a lot of meat,</i>

21:44.336 --> 21:45.938
so it's
a little nerve‐racking

21:45.938 --> 21:47.973
to get something
that I've never cooked before.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.042
<i>but I want to show</i>
<i>the judges that I can cook</i>
<i>whatever they give me.</i>

21:50.042 --> 21:51.043
<i>I've gotta come out on top.</i>

21:54.613 --> 21:56.515
I'm gonna make
a hanger steak.

21:56.515 --> 21:58.984
I'm gonna roast mushrooms
and tomato down

21:58.984 --> 22:01.420
with some prosciutto,
and I'm going to do

22:01.420 --> 22:03.322
two potatoes
two type of ways.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.790
One honey butter
sweet potato,

22:04.790 --> 22:08.594
and a chunky mashed potato
with dill, parsley,
and garlic in it.

22:08.594 --> 22:10.429
I don't typically
make hanger steak.

22:10.429 --> 22:11.797
This is another
first for me,

22:11.797 --> 22:13.432
but I'm gonna try
to rock it today.

22:16.936 --> 22:19.738
I'm making my fiancée's
favorite dish,

22:19.738 --> 22:21.440
hanger steak
with caramelized onions,

22:21.440 --> 22:23.642
a white cheddar
mashed potatoes,

22:23.642 --> 22:25.344
and some pan‐seared
Brussels sprouts.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.745
I'm not going home.

22:26.745 --> 22:28.180
Gonna make sure that I get
the best dish out there.

22:29.682 --> 22:32.751
Right, hanger steak.
Now this is the prize jewel.

22:32.751 --> 22:34.286
It's one of the most
sought‐after cuts.

22:34.286 --> 22:35.921
Aarón:
The hanger is
the perfect sponge.

22:35.921 --> 22:39.925
It can take on everything
from a red wine sauce.

22:39.925 --> 22:41.327
It can take a rub on as well.

22:41.327 --> 22:43.529
It's a great versatile
piece of protein.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.764
But it's
a temperamental cut.

22:45.764 --> 22:47.433
Oh, God.

22:47.433 --> 22:49.201
Undercooked,
and it's like chuck steak.

22:49.201 --> 22:52.938
Cooked beautifully, rested,
and it's like filet.

22:55.474 --> 22:57.376
That looks good, Cate.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.945
All right, Miss Cate,
my Chicago gal,

22:59.945 --> 23:01.046
what do you got
going on here?

23:01.046 --> 23:03.749
I got a little smoking gun
action going on.

23:03.749 --> 23:06.952
Gonna smoke some almonds
and give a nice toast to them.

23:06.952 --> 23:10.456
So I am making
a marinated hanger steak

23:10.456 --> 23:12.091
with a Romesco sauce,

23:12.091 --> 23:14.326
and I'm gonna do
a stuffed shishito pepper.

23:14.326 --> 23:17.263
Do you use gadgets
like a smoking gun
at home in Chicago?

23:17.263 --> 23:19.798
Last Father's Day,
I bought my dad a smoker,

23:19.798 --> 23:23.502
so we've been
in the backyard smoking
everything you can.

23:23.502 --> 23:25.738
‐ All right, good luck, mama.
‐ Thanks.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.106
Make sure that hanger steak
is cooked to perfection.

23:27.106 --> 23:29.742
Thank you. It will be.

23:29.742 --> 23:32.411
‐ Gonna give us
a masterpiece, Necco?
‐ Here's hoping, kid.

23:32.411 --> 23:33.979
‐ Necco.
‐ Yes, Chef.

23:33.979 --> 23:35.748
Hanger steak,
ever cooked it before?

23:35.748 --> 23:37.683
No, I've never made
a hanger steak before,

23:37.683 --> 23:40.119
but I feel pretty
good about it.

23:40.119 --> 23:44.590
You know, it's a very tough,
difficult, tempestuous
piece of protein.

23:44.590 --> 23:45.958
I actually read a book
recently that said

23:45.958 --> 23:48.193
it's not a terribly difficult
thing to work with.

23:48.193 --> 23:50.763
I'm not worried about
this challenge one bit.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.698
‐ I'm feeling
quite comfortable.
‐ Wow.

23:52.698 --> 23:56.001
Listen, it's a tough,
demanding, awkward meat
to get right,

23:56.001 --> 23:58.103
so it needs to be
the sort of mid‐rare.

23:58.103 --> 24:00.005
Get it right,
it's the dish of the night.

24:00.005 --> 24:02.107
Well, it's just grilling
a piece of meat, right?

24:02.107 --> 24:05.210
So how hard can
it really be?

24:05.210 --> 24:07.913
Caitlin:
<i>Necco's not listening</i>
<i>to Gordon at all,</i>

24:07.913 --> 24:10.449
and that shows the judges
you're not willing to learn,

24:10.449 --> 24:11.617
you're not willing to grow.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.252
I know that I know
temperatures,

24:13.252 --> 24:15.120
and I feel confident in it,

24:15.120 --> 24:18.290
and I think
I'm just doing me.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.059
Ooh, ( bleep ).

24:26.432 --> 24:27.566
Gordon:
Necco, hanger steak,

24:27.566 --> 24:29.435
it needs to be
the sort of mid‐rare.

24:29.435 --> 24:30.803
Get it right,
it's the dish of the night.

24:30.803 --> 24:31.937
I know that
I know temperatures,

24:31.937 --> 24:33.906
and I feel confident in it,

24:33.906 --> 24:37.176
and I think
I'm just doing me.

24:37.176 --> 24:38.444
Ooh, ( bleep ).

24:38.444 --> 24:40.179
‐ What does that mean?
‐ You know,

24:40.179 --> 24:42.448
I want to make sure
I'm doing what I need to do

24:42.448 --> 24:44.316
to get this cooked properly,

24:44.316 --> 24:47.953
and try to bring out the beauty
in this product as a whole.

24:47.953 --> 24:50.789
And it's gonna be
a beautiful steak.
I'm really confident.

24:50.789 --> 24:53.525
‐ So I'm not worried about it.
‐ Gotcha.

24:53.525 --> 24:55.627
‐ Mr. Humble, good luck.
‐ I appreciate it.

24:55.627 --> 24:57.296
Less than 30 minutes,
everyone.

24:57.296 --> 24:58.697
All right,
let's do this thing.

24:58.697 --> 25:00.299
‐ All right, Gabriel.
‐ Yes, Chef.

25:00.299 --> 25:01.900
Talk to me about
what you're making.

25:01.900 --> 25:04.937
Today I'm gonna do
a simple herb and smoked
salt‐crusted hanger steak

25:04.937 --> 25:07.239
with a little bit of balsamic
pomegranate glazed carrots,

25:07.239 --> 25:10.075
and then
I'm going to do my take
on a potato dauphinoise.

25:10.075 --> 25:11.377
Have you made a potato
dauphinoise before?

25:11.377 --> 25:12.911
Never before, Chef.
I got 'em in the oven now,

25:12.911 --> 25:14.113
and hopefully,
it's gonna work out.

25:14.113 --> 25:15.948
Your spot in the competition
is at risk here.

25:15.948 --> 25:18.417
Is this the right time
to put all your cards
on the table?

25:18.417 --> 25:20.552
If I can't prove to y'all
that I can do stuff
out of my comfort zone,

25:20.552 --> 25:22.287
‐ what am I doing here?
‐ There's a lot riding
on this dish.

25:22.287 --> 25:24.823
Make sure that every
element is spot on.

25:24.823 --> 25:25.891
‐ You got it, Chef.
‐ Good luck.

25:25.891 --> 25:27.226
Thank you, Chef.

25:28.394 --> 25:29.895
‐ Jason.
‐ Chef Ramsay.

25:29.895 --> 25:31.430
‐ How are you feeling?
‐ I'm feeling very well.

25:31.430 --> 25:32.631
Tell me about the dish.
What are you doing?

25:32.631 --> 25:34.500
I'm gonna channel
my Asian roots

25:34.500 --> 25:37.069
with a little bit
of five‐spiced powder
on a hanger steak

25:37.069 --> 25:39.905
with French fries,
and I'm gonna be serving it
with broccoli rabe.

25:39.905 --> 25:41.440
Sort of a semi‐fusion.
Bit of a French classic,

25:41.440 --> 25:43.075
Chinese five spice
to bring in that
Asian influence.

25:43.075 --> 25:45.778
‐ Oh, yeah.
‐ Now, Newton thinks
you're a threat.

25:45.778 --> 25:46.912
Are you nervous?

25:46.912 --> 25:48.480
I think, you know,
when I'm in the classroom,

25:48.480 --> 25:49.648
or if I'm performing music,

25:49.648 --> 25:51.116
there's always
an element of nerves.

25:51.116 --> 25:52.451
If you're not nervous,
you're not ready to go.

25:52.451 --> 25:54.686
So I'm just gonna try
to move efficiently,

25:54.686 --> 25:56.989
and tonight I'm the conductor,
and I'm gonna make it work.

25:56.989 --> 25:58.123
‐ Good luck.
‐ Thank you.

25:59.691 --> 26:01.593
Christina:
18 minutes to go, guys.

26:01.593 --> 26:03.462
Taste, taste, taste!

26:03.462 --> 26:05.064
Mm‐hmm.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.765
‐ Yachecia.
‐ Yes, Chef.

26:06.765 --> 26:08.801
‐ How you doing, darling?
‐ I'm doing pretty good, Chef.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.302
Talk to me a little bit
about your dish.

26:10.302 --> 26:13.539
I have a marinated hanger steak
with sautéed mushrooms

26:13.539 --> 26:15.808
and asparagus
and a polenta cake.

26:15.808 --> 26:18.043
All right, so, Newton,
in essence, put you down here

26:18.043 --> 26:19.812
'cause he views you
as strong competition.

26:19.812 --> 26:21.814
Correct, Chef,
because he knows

26:21.814 --> 26:23.449
once I get down
in this kitchen,
I'm an assassin.

26:23.449 --> 26:25.717
‐ I'm strong.
‐ You're an assassin.

26:25.717 --> 26:27.486
I've been through a lot
of ups and downs in life,

26:27.486 --> 26:30.222
and so, I had to focus on
getting my son through school,

26:30.222 --> 26:32.558
and I can't do it
with being soft.

26:32.558 --> 26:33.992
I gotta be tough enough
to take it.

26:33.992 --> 26:35.961
‐ Keep your eye on
the prize, all right?
‐ Yes, Chef.

26:35.961 --> 26:38.797
‐ Good luck to you,
okay, Miss Yachecia?
‐ Thank you, Chef.

26:38.797 --> 26:40.466
Gordon:
Ten minutes remaining.

26:40.466 --> 26:44.269
Remember, your hanger steak
needs to rest. Come on.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.804
So, who are
the potential standouts?

26:45.804 --> 26:50.275
Cate. She is making a Romesco
with some smoked almonds.

26:50.275 --> 26:52.511
‐ Perfect.
‐ I'm glad that she's
really challenging herself

26:52.511 --> 26:53.979
over these 60 minutes.

26:53.979 --> 26:56.782
Jason's combining French
elements with Asian.

26:56.782 --> 26:59.184
It sounds interesting.
It may be a little bit
too complicated.

26:59.184 --> 27:00.419
I'd be a little worried.

27:00.419 --> 27:02.221
That's just
not gonna work out.

27:02.221 --> 27:04.256
Gordon:
I'm slightly worried
about Necco.

27:04.256 --> 27:05.290
He's a little bit
overconfident,

27:05.290 --> 27:07.192
but he's
all over the place.

27:07.192 --> 27:08.293
Look at him, he doesn't
know what he's doing.

27:08.293 --> 27:10.395
Just not there yet.

27:10.395 --> 27:13.198
Oh. It's not there yet.

27:17.236 --> 27:18.704
Gordon:
Two minutes remaining.

27:18.704 --> 27:22.107
Your plates have got
to ooze finesse.

27:22.107 --> 27:24.443
Damn.

27:24.443 --> 27:25.911
Think, think, think, Gabe.
Think, Gabe. Think, Gabe.

27:29.414 --> 27:32.284
Oh, Gabriel
just put his steak back in!
He thinks it's raw!

27:32.284 --> 27:33.752
Not now, not now,
not now.

27:33.752 --> 27:35.954
Christina:
He doesn't have time!

27:35.954 --> 27:37.956
Keep going, Gabe.
Let's go, guys.

27:37.956 --> 27:40.259
‐ Come on, Jason.
‐ Garnish!

27:40.259 --> 27:41.894
Brien:
This is it, guys,
crunch time.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.729
Gordon:
60 seconds remaining!

27:43.729 --> 27:45.464
Last minute!
For one of you,

27:45.464 --> 27:49.101
your last minute inside
the MasterChef kitchen.

27:49.101 --> 27:51.503
Almost there, guys.
Stay focused, stay focused.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.739
Aarón:
Come on, Eboni, let's go.

27:53.739 --> 27:55.607
‐ Gordon: Ten...
‐ Judges: Nine...

27:55.607 --> 27:57.809
eight, seven, six,

27:57.809 --> 28:00.779
five, four, three,

28:00.779 --> 28:02.614
two, one!

28:02.614 --> 28:04.283
‐ Gordon: Stop!
‐ Christina: Hands in the air!

28:06.185 --> 28:08.887
Gordon: Well done!

28:08.887 --> 28:13.358
Now, all of you,
bring your dishes
down to the front.

28:13.358 --> 28:16.728
Newton:
<i>You know, having the top seven</i>
<i>compete was a great idea,</i>

28:16.728 --> 28:20.199
<i>because one of</i>
<i>the strongest competitors</i>
<i>is going home today,</i>

28:20.199 --> 28:22.401
<i>and I'm a‐okay with that.</i>

28:22.401 --> 28:24.269
You know,
less competition for me.

28:24.269 --> 28:27.272
Now, it's time for
the most important part:

28:27.272 --> 28:30.709
the tasting of those
incredible hanger steaks.

28:30.709 --> 28:34.913
Right, Jason,
describe the dish, please.

28:34.913 --> 28:36.415
So I have for you today

28:36.415 --> 28:39.651
a Chinese five spice rub
hanger steak

28:39.651 --> 28:41.653
with eryngii
or king trumpet mushrooms,

28:41.653 --> 28:44.923
and with seared broccolini,
French fries,

28:44.923 --> 28:46.658
with a cilantro aioli.

28:46.658 --> 28:50.896
Visually, it looks
like a chef's dish.

28:50.896 --> 28:53.265
‐ How long did you cook it for?
‐ Four minutes per side,

28:53.265 --> 28:56.001
and I flipped it
a little bit.

28:56.001 --> 28:57.836
I know it's
a coarser texture,

28:57.836 --> 29:00.138
so I wanted to keep it
very rich and very tender.

29:00.138 --> 29:02.541
With such
a temperamental cut,

29:02.541 --> 29:06.578
the less you cook it,
the worse it can taste.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.947
That's my worry.
Let's get in there,
shall we?

29:10.449 --> 29:14.286
Now, inside, it should be
medium rare, pink.

29:25.731 --> 29:27.232
Let's get in there,
shall we?

29:28.433 --> 29:33.205
Now, inside, it should be
medium rare, pink.

29:33.205 --> 29:37.109
Now, it is definitely
on the rare side.

29:39.478 --> 29:40.812
‐ Oh, wow,
‐ It's that raw.

29:40.812 --> 29:44.583
So, how long did you
marinate it for?

29:44.583 --> 29:47.653
It was marinated probably
at least 10, 15 minutes.

29:47.653 --> 29:49.621
That could be
the saving grace.

29:55.127 --> 29:59.097
You are... lucky.

29:59.097 --> 30:01.466
The steak is undercooked,

30:01.466 --> 30:03.302
but it's as tender
as anything,

30:03.302 --> 30:06.305
and that's because you had
the sense to marinate it.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.173
The fries are good,
the sauce is good.

30:08.173 --> 30:09.975
However, what's
the hero tonight?

30:09.975 --> 30:11.643
Hanger steak.

30:11.643 --> 30:14.980
It's not a protein
that should be served rare.

30:14.980 --> 30:17.482
Thank you, Chef.

30:19.985 --> 30:21.453
Jeff, describe to me
your dish.

30:21.453 --> 30:24.990
So we have a hanger steak
that's done up

30:24.990 --> 30:27.659
over a white cheddar
mashed potatoes,

30:27.659 --> 30:31.663
with caramelized onions
and pan‐seared
Brussels sprouts

30:31.663 --> 30:33.298
with pancetta chips.

30:33.298 --> 30:36.001
I have to be honest.
Looking at this...

30:37.302 --> 30:39.538
a little slovenly.

30:39.538 --> 30:41.973
It looks like something
you'd get at a buffet.

30:41.973 --> 30:44.476
Now, before you start
beating yourself up,

30:44.476 --> 30:47.813
‐ that is medium rare
right there.
‐ Yes, it is.

30:47.813 --> 30:49.381
You have cabbage in there
as well or just onion?

30:49.381 --> 30:50.816
No, just some
caramelized red onions

30:50.816 --> 30:53.652
and then that nice
red wine tomato sauce.

30:55.554 --> 30:59.124
I gotta say, this is
a perfect example

30:59.124 --> 31:01.326
of when a dish
doesn't look good,

31:01.326 --> 31:05.497
‐ and it tastes fantastic.
‐ Thank you.

31:05.497 --> 31:09.835
It's warm, it's rich,
it's seasoned properly.

31:09.835 --> 31:13.438
The vegetables
are cooked correctly.

31:13.438 --> 31:15.107
That right there
is dynamite.

31:15.107 --> 31:16.575
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

31:16.575 --> 31:18.243
‐ Good job.
‐ Thank you.

31:23.014 --> 31:25.016
‐ Miss Eboni.
‐ Hi, Chef.

31:25.016 --> 31:26.918
What'd you make?

31:26.918 --> 31:31.256
I made a dry‐rubbed
lemon‐crusted hanger steak

31:31.256 --> 31:33.525
with dill and parsley
mashed potato

31:33.525 --> 31:36.294
with roasted mushrooms
and sweet potato.

31:36.294 --> 31:40.365
Visually,
I think it looks...

31:40.365 --> 31:43.101
a little rudimentary.

31:43.101 --> 31:46.104
The sort of circular shapes,
and then the square shape,

31:46.104 --> 31:47.272
and then
the rectangular shape

31:47.272 --> 31:51.810
feels like
I'm in kindergarten class.

31:51.810 --> 31:57.048
Now, how confident
are you that this is
medium rare?

31:57.048 --> 31:58.049
Scale of nine to ten?

31:58.049 --> 31:59.117
‐ Nine.
‐ Okay.

31:59.117 --> 32:00.385
There's only one way
to find out.

32:01.586 --> 32:03.054
I'm gonna slice in,

32:03.054 --> 32:05.590
and I wanna see
a nice pink.

32:10.095 --> 32:12.130
‐ It's cooked beautifully.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

32:12.130 --> 32:13.432
( whistles )

32:13.432 --> 32:15.000
Now, how did you end up
cooking the steak?

32:15.000 --> 32:17.969
I did a dry rub on it
and I pan seared it.

32:19.404 --> 32:22.007
The hanger steak
is delicious.

32:22.007 --> 32:23.408
It's beautiful.
It's perfectly cooked.

32:23.408 --> 32:25.610
It's so juicy
in the middle.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.946
You nailed the cook on this.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.848
Now, let's talk about
these potatoes.

32:29.848 --> 32:33.351
‐ Yes.
‐ Pretty dry.

32:33.351 --> 32:36.421
This part of the dish,
the star of the dish,
is beautiful.

32:36.421 --> 32:38.323
This part of the dish
is not good.

32:38.323 --> 32:40.325
But overall,
really nice job.

32:46.965 --> 32:50.168
Right, Gabriel.
Describe the dish.

32:50.168 --> 32:53.171
So you have
a pan‐seared hanger steak,

32:53.171 --> 32:55.340
with some beef stock
caramelized carrots,

32:55.340 --> 32:56.975
and some crispy potatoes.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.176
Something I've come
to admire about you

32:58.176 --> 33:00.779
‐ is that you're fearless.
‐ Yes, Chef.

33:00.779 --> 33:03.949
But that just
looks plain to me.

33:05.584 --> 33:08.119
The meat is seared,
but I'm worried about
the temperature.

33:08.119 --> 33:10.622
‐ What have you gone for?
‐ I was going for
medium rare, Chef.

33:14.826 --> 33:15.961
Come on, baby.

33:17.496 --> 33:19.097
Oh, young man.

33:20.932 --> 33:24.503
That thing's minutes away
from being put back
in the field.

33:25.770 --> 33:28.840
Oh, Gabriel.
Gabriel, Gabriel, Gabriel.

33:31.076 --> 33:32.611
What did you
marinate it in?

33:32.611 --> 33:34.446
‐ I didn't marinate it, Chef.
‐ You didn't marinate it.

33:34.446 --> 33:36.848
No, Chef,
I did a dry rub.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.016
It's so undercooked,

33:38.016 --> 33:39.584
even the seasoning
hasn't had a chance

33:39.584 --> 33:42.454
to sort of disintegrate
and work its magic.

33:42.454 --> 33:44.122
I'm completely pissed
at myself, Chef.

33:44.122 --> 33:45.524
That's not something
I want to serve anybody,

33:45.524 --> 33:47.359
let alone serve to somebody
of your stature.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.761
You know, potatoes,
beautifully done,

33:49.761 --> 33:52.163
carrots, beautifully glazed,
sauce not too thick.

33:52.163 --> 33:54.633
You can cook,

33:54.633 --> 33:57.936
but what pains me
is that you've got

33:57.936 --> 34:00.038
so much potential
in this competition

34:00.038 --> 34:02.541
and over the years
I've seen so much talent

34:02.541 --> 34:04.609
disappear
through those doors

34:04.609 --> 34:06.111
through silly mistakes
like that.

34:06.111 --> 34:08.547
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ ( sighs )

34:13.151 --> 34:14.953
Cate, talk to me
about your dish.

34:14.953 --> 34:18.156
This is a marinated
and grilled hanger steak

34:18.156 --> 34:21.893
with a red pepper Romesco,
grilled asparagus,

34:21.893 --> 34:25.230
stuffed shishito peppers,
finished with smoked almonds.

34:25.230 --> 34:26.398
I could get
all these ingredients

34:26.398 --> 34:29.568
in a ten‐acre radius
of my dad's farm,

34:29.568 --> 34:31.469
so this is me on a plate.

34:31.469 --> 34:34.472
When I cut that steak,
what is it supposed to
look like inside?

34:34.472 --> 34:36.508
This is gonna be
a beautiful medium.

34:36.508 --> 34:37.742
Okay.

34:45.684 --> 34:47.185
That is a thing
of beauty.

34:47.185 --> 34:48.520
It really is.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.188
It has the cook
all the way through.

34:50.188 --> 34:51.856
This is how you cook
hanger steak.

34:51.856 --> 34:54.326
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ What did you stuff
the shishitos with?

34:54.326 --> 34:55.961
With a little bit
of goat cheese,

34:55.961 --> 34:59.831
and then I caramelized
some shallots and garlic.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.235
‐ That is dynamite.
‐ Yay!

35:04.235 --> 35:06.471
It's cooked perfectly.

35:06.471 --> 35:08.707
The asparagus is perfect.

35:08.707 --> 35:11.910
The shishito peppers
is a cute little idea.

35:11.910 --> 35:13.912
And based on this dish,

35:13.912 --> 35:15.413
I think you're well beyond

35:15.413 --> 35:16.648
a lot of the people
in this room.

35:16.648 --> 35:18.717
‐ Can I get a high‐five?
‐ There you go.

35:20.919 --> 35:22.487
Thank you so much.

35:27.759 --> 35:29.227
All right, Necco.

35:29.227 --> 35:31.229
What's going on here?

35:31.229 --> 35:35.300
I'm confused.
What‐‐ what is this?

35:45.644 --> 35:47.012
All right, Necco.

35:47.012 --> 35:48.680
What's going on here?

35:48.680 --> 35:50.915
Uh, we have a marinated,
grilled hanger steak.

35:50.915 --> 35:55.987
Necco, I'm confused.
What‐‐ what is this?

35:55.987 --> 35:58.623
I'm not‐‐
I don't understand
what's going on.

35:58.623 --> 36:04.062
It looks a little bit
like a sausage patty
with hash browns.

36:04.062 --> 36:07.899
This makes me feel
like it's food for,
like, a little dollhouse.

36:07.899 --> 36:09.901
I don't think so.

36:09.901 --> 36:12.404
I feel like my presentation
is hands‐down the best,

36:12.404 --> 36:16.274
and my flavors mend
well together.

36:16.274 --> 36:19.411
Maybe I'm not
really understanding
the inspiration.

36:19.411 --> 36:21.413
Tell me what you made.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.615
We have a marinated,
grilled hanger steak,

36:23.615 --> 36:25.817
with morels sautéed
in brown butter,

36:25.817 --> 36:29.287
a stuffed tomato
and a potato cake.

36:29.287 --> 36:32.424
I felt that the plating
was nice this way.

36:32.424 --> 36:34.959
Okay. Temperature‐wise,
what were you going for?

36:34.959 --> 36:36.127
I was hoping
for a medium rare.

36:36.127 --> 36:37.796
Let's see what we got.

36:42.634 --> 36:46.571
Ooh.
It's undercooked.
Look at that.

36:46.571 --> 36:48.973
‐ What happened there?
‐ I feel it's not deep red.

36:50.975 --> 36:54.979
But I got a big ol'
blood line coming in there.

36:54.979 --> 36:58.149
You need more time
searing this

36:58.149 --> 36:59.617
and you didn't give it
enough time to rest.

37:03.021 --> 37:05.957
You know, Necco,
you didn't nail any
element on the plate.

37:07.525 --> 37:10.628
Presentation
is disappointing.
I'm sorry.

37:16.401 --> 37:18.069
‐ Yachecia.
‐ Yes, Chef.

37:18.069 --> 37:20.572
Okay, describe the dish,
please.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.974
It is an herb‐marinated
hanger steak

37:22.974 --> 37:25.710
with sautéed mushrooms,
polenta cake,

37:25.710 --> 37:27.779
and roasted asparagus.

37:27.779 --> 37:32.283
Visually, um,
you got that wow factor.

37:32.283 --> 37:34.886
I love the finesse,
the creativity,
the colors.

37:34.886 --> 37:37.489
You've got the blend right.
What temperature have you
gone for on the steak?

37:37.489 --> 37:41.960
Medium, Chef.
Marinated with a little bit
of oil, some fresh thyme,

37:41.960 --> 37:44.329
‐ and garlic.
‐ You've nailed the cook.

37:44.329 --> 37:45.830
‐ The cook looks beautiful.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

37:45.830 --> 37:48.066
And it packs moisture,

37:48.066 --> 37:49.734
almost where
it's just oozing.

37:49.734 --> 37:51.836
Thank you, Chef.

37:51.836 --> 37:54.005
Wow. Holy ( bleep ).

37:54.005 --> 37:56.407
‐ I know you can't
say that in church.
‐ No, Chef.

37:56.407 --> 37:58.476
But we're not in
( bleep ) church.

37:58.476 --> 38:02.180
‐ O. M. G. It's delicious.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

38:02.180 --> 38:04.249
Beyond cooking
the hanger steak
to perfection,

38:04.249 --> 38:06.451
polenta cake,
the grilled asparagus,

38:06.451 --> 38:08.086
and then those mushrooms
with the peppers

38:08.086 --> 38:10.088
actually taste quite nice
all together.

38:10.088 --> 38:13.124
I think Newton
missed big time.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.093
‐ Good job.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

38:15.093 --> 38:17.562
‐ Hallelujah.
‐ Hallelujah.

38:17.562 --> 38:19.264
Great job, Yachecia.

38:22.133 --> 38:25.303
All right, will everyone
please come around
to the front?

38:25.303 --> 38:26.704
Jason:
<i>I'm really scared.</i>

38:26.704 --> 38:28.773
This steak could
totally send me home.

38:28.773 --> 38:31.376
<i>I do not want</i>
<i>to go home today.</i>

38:34.112 --> 38:35.814
According to Newton,

38:35.814 --> 38:39.450
you are the seven best
home cooks in this kitchen.

38:39.450 --> 38:40.952
We think that
he was certainly right

38:40.952 --> 38:44.222
about two
home cooks tonight.

38:44.222 --> 38:48.560
Cate and Yachecia.
Nice job to both of you.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.562
You are safe.
Please head up
to the balcony.

38:50.562 --> 38:52.163
‐ Thank you.
‐ Thank you.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.832
‐ Good job, ladies.
‐ Come on up, guys.

38:56.401 --> 38:58.903
Thanks, Newton,
for giving me an opportunity
to shine right now,

38:58.903 --> 39:01.506
because if you hadn't have
left me down here,

39:01.506 --> 39:04.075
<i>I wouldn't have had this</i>
<i>opportunity to wow the judges,</i>

39:04.075 --> 39:05.877
so I'm super happy.

39:05.877 --> 39:08.613
Aarón:
Two other home cooks
did just enough

39:08.613 --> 39:10.715
to prove
that Newton was right.

39:13.218 --> 39:15.720
Jeff and Eboni,

39:15.720 --> 39:17.388
‐ please head up
to the balcony.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

39:17.388 --> 39:19.224
‐ Good job, guys!
‐ Nice job, Eboni.

39:19.224 --> 39:23.061
( laughs )

39:23.061 --> 39:24.362
<i>Newton,</i>
<i>you better watch out,</i>

39:24.362 --> 39:26.197
'cause you threw me
down here in this fire

39:26.197 --> 39:27.432
and you thought
I was gonna get burned.

39:27.432 --> 39:28.533
<i>I walked away.</i>

39:28.533 --> 39:30.101
( vocalizing )

39:30.101 --> 39:32.303
<i>You better hope the roles</i>
<i>don't get reversed.</i>

39:32.303 --> 39:34.639
You goin' home.
Yee‐haw to that.

39:35.940 --> 39:38.409
Gordon:
Jason, Gabriel, and Necco,

39:38.409 --> 39:41.145
all three of you
unsuccessfully

39:41.145 --> 39:44.549
cooked that protein.

39:44.549 --> 39:46.217
Ultimately,
our decision comes down

39:46.217 --> 39:50.488
to who learns from
their mistakes better?

39:53.424 --> 39:57.128
The person leaving
the MasterChef kitchen...

40:00.164 --> 40:02.133
is...

40:04.402 --> 40:05.403
Necco.

40:10.008 --> 40:13.344
Jason, Gabriel,
say goodnight to Necco,

40:13.344 --> 40:14.812
and head on upstairs.

40:18.349 --> 40:19.851
( muttering )

40:25.156 --> 40:28.159
Necco, the fact
that you presented
a dish like that tonight,

40:28.159 --> 40:30.695
and then proclaimed
how good it is,

40:30.695 --> 40:33.531
it's almost like
you cannot fathom

40:33.531 --> 40:36.701
the fundamental errors
that you made.

40:36.701 --> 40:40.538
It's a great shame,
because you are
a talented individual.

40:40.538 --> 40:42.173
Unfortunately,
your time is done on
"MasterChef."

40:42.173 --> 40:43.675
Please put
your apron on the bench
and say goodnight.

40:43.675 --> 40:45.209
‐ Thank you.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

40:45.209 --> 40:48.713
‐ Love you, Necco.
‐ Bye, guys.

40:48.713 --> 40:51.316
I'm super disappointed
to leave this competition.

40:51.316 --> 40:53.017
<i>Newton's plan worked.</i>

40:53.017 --> 40:54.352
<i>Looks like he's sending home</i>
<i>one of the strongest</i>

40:54.352 --> 40:55.853
<i>competitors in the game</i>
<i>right now.</i>

40:55.853 --> 40:58.022
Love you, Necco.

40:58.022 --> 41:00.058
<i>When I first came into</i>
<i>the MasterChef kitchen,</i>

41:00.058 --> 41:02.493
I was just another guy

41:02.493 --> 41:04.762
from a small town
in South Carolina.

41:04.762 --> 41:09.133
But today, I'm leaving
an accomplished home cook,

41:09.133 --> 41:12.670
<i>with a foundation</i>
<i>to create so much more</i>

41:12.670 --> 41:15.139
<i>in the world of cooking.</i>

41:19.610 --> 41:21.245
Announcer:
<i>Next time...</i>

41:21.245 --> 41:24.148
<i>the MasterChef restaurant</i>
<i>opens its doors</i>

41:24.148 --> 41:26.584
<i>to its most important</i>
<i>guests yet.</i>

41:26.584 --> 41:27.752
Aarón:
These hard‐working people

41:27.752 --> 41:30.154
are the backbone
of the culinary world.

41:30.154 --> 41:31.990
<i>And in a challenge</i>

41:31.990 --> 41:34.125
<i>where the ingredients</i>
<i>take center stage...</i>

41:34.125 --> 41:36.661
You're cooking
with their product.

41:36.661 --> 41:38.629
If we don't get it right,
it could ruin the entire dish.

41:38.629 --> 41:40.465
<i>which team will</i>
<i>steal the spotlight...</i>

41:40.465 --> 41:42.367
You need
two gallons of polenta.
Get it done.

41:42.367 --> 41:45.503
<i>and who will take</i>
<i>their final curtain call?</i>

41:45.503 --> 41:47.638
‐ Gordon: <i>Ricotta with halibut.</i>
‐ Aarón: <i>Fish and cheese.</i>

41:47.638 --> 41:50.641
Ricotta and halibut
do not go together.
