WEBVTT

00:49.816 --> 00:53.019
Now, we only have two people
who are without partners.

00:53.753 --> 00:56.856
JB and Jin Yu-jin aren't here yet.

00:57.957 --> 00:59.859
So, would you two,
Rian and Shin Hae-seong,

01:01.394 --> 01:03.963
like to be partners?

01:58.017 --> 02:00.787
I've been hesitating to say this,

02:03.323 --> 02:04.424
but I won't hold back anymore.

02:05.925 --> 02:06.759
Hae-seong.

02:08.928 --> 02:09.896
I like you.

02:12.832 --> 02:13.666
Why?

02:15.802 --> 02:17.036
There's no reason.

02:18.571 --> 02:21.441
I couldn't think of a reason
no matter how much I tried.

02:25.745 --> 02:29.249
It's just like how I can't explain
why I like music so much

02:30.617 --> 02:31.918
and why I wanted to become a singer.

02:35.421 --> 02:36.589
I just like you.

02:40.927 --> 02:42.729
I would like to sing with you.

02:44.764 --> 02:46.199
I want to take the stage with you

02:47.967 --> 02:49.502
and sing with you.

03:08.488 --> 03:09.322
Shin Hae-seong.

03:10.423 --> 03:13.526
Will you accept JB as your partner?

03:25.738 --> 03:26.573
Say no...

04:04.310 --> 04:07.213
Shin Hae-seong and JB are now partners.

04:07.780 --> 04:11.551
We now have Rian and Jin Yu-jin left.

04:43.349 --> 04:46.953
Rian and Jin Yu-jin
have wrapped up the partner selection.

04:47.787 --> 04:52.759
Please do your best to put on a great
performance on the day of the duet.

05:26.793 --> 05:29.929
I take back what I said
about us being friends.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.501
Congratulations.

05:37.503 --> 05:41.040
This is the first time
you defied Mr. Lee, isn't it?

05:43.476 --> 05:44.377
Rian.

05:45.678 --> 05:46.512
Thank you

05:48.047 --> 05:52.151
for making me realize
that I had been mistaken.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.723
Thanks to you and Hae-seong,

05:57.523 --> 05:59.659
I now have the urge to do my best.

06:02.395 --> 06:04.797
Soon, you'll come to realize

06:06.366 --> 06:07.700
that you have made a terrible mistake.

06:14.273 --> 06:15.174
Thanks.

06:16.576 --> 06:17.577
I mean it.

06:30.823 --> 06:33.593
I'll help you beat them.

06:36.329 --> 06:37.530
We will win.

07:02.288 --> 07:06.392
So, you're actually undergoing
the audition process again?

07:07.527 --> 07:09.662
Mom, don't you believe in me?

07:10.530 --> 07:11.831
I'm going to win first place.

07:13.399 --> 07:14.667
HershE split up.

07:14.734 --> 07:16.702
Why are you insisting on staying with Oz?

07:17.170 --> 07:19.071
You can switch agencies
and focus on your acting,

07:19.572 --> 07:24.210
or have them put you in another
girl group if singing is what you want.

07:24.477 --> 07:26.979
So that I can be the pretty face again?

07:27.747 --> 07:29.015
What's wrong with that?

07:29.549 --> 07:31.717
It's a compliment.

07:32.418 --> 07:33.252
Mom.

07:33.786 --> 07:36.122
I'm sick and tired of hearing
that I'm pretty.

07:42.862 --> 07:43.830
You just watch.

07:45.565 --> 07:46.966
I'm going to be the best.

07:48.634 --> 07:50.303
All on my own.

07:52.538 --> 07:55.141
Excuse me! More rice, please.

07:55.441 --> 07:56.342
Coming up.

08:13.059 --> 08:14.927
It's like nothing happened.

08:15.528 --> 08:18.364
They seem to have forgotten
about what happened yesterday.

08:20.566 --> 08:22.935
Will those two be okay though?

08:23.302 --> 08:25.071
The most searched keyword
on the Internet yesterday

08:25.438 --> 08:26.606
was "JB cheating."

08:32.411 --> 08:35.114
You already did a duet mission
for the monthly evaluation, right?

08:35.281 --> 08:37.917
The key is mutual understanding.

08:38.184 --> 08:40.920
You must know your partner's
strengths and weaknesses

08:40.987 --> 08:43.489
before you can truly understand
him or her.

08:43.990 --> 08:46.325
You need to highlight
your partner's strengths

08:46.392 --> 08:48.060
and make up for his or her weaknesses.

08:48.394 --> 08:52.465
Understanding and consideration
make for perfect harmony.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.303
Today, you will get to know
your partner better

08:57.370 --> 08:59.038
by asking questions.

08:59.405 --> 09:01.874
Please be as honest as you can
with your answers.

09:06.412 --> 09:07.580
What's your phone number?

09:09.315 --> 09:10.349
What's your pants size?

09:12.985 --> 09:14.220
Just describe your ideal girl.

09:22.762 --> 09:23.930
Like this.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.265
What about this move?

09:33.739 --> 09:34.740
You scared me.

09:37.510 --> 09:38.878
You should be honest with yourself.

09:40.580 --> 09:44.150
It's so obvious you have feelings
for Shin Hae-seong.

09:44.817 --> 09:47.186
You're not asking a question.
You're forcing an answer.

09:48.654 --> 09:51.691
Why do you like her?
What's so great about her?

09:52.291 --> 09:53.459
How much do you like her?

09:55.294 --> 09:59.031
Come on. We need to get to know
each other to win first place.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.666
Oh, please.

10:02.568 --> 10:03.836
You get angry.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.606
And your face flushes.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.007
What?

10:09.442 --> 10:10.676
I know all there is to know.

10:11.544 --> 10:14.113
Jin Yu-jin likes Shin Hae-seong.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.515
Getting to know Jin Yu-jin, all done.

10:17.416 --> 10:19.452
-What?
-The end.

10:25.958 --> 10:26.892
What's this?

10:33.866 --> 10:35.234
What's all this?

10:35.801 --> 10:37.136
Is there a shoot today?

10:37.603 --> 10:38.504
What shoot?

10:38.738 --> 10:39.839
You idiots.

10:39.905 --> 10:41.307
Didn't you hear about the shoot today?

10:42.074 --> 10:44.644
Wait. What did they say...

10:51.951 --> 10:55.655
Don't be alarmed.
Today's special class is simple.

10:56.622 --> 11:00.660
Dress your partner how you want,
and then do a photo shoot.

11:02.762 --> 11:03.829
How we want?

11:04.930 --> 11:07.033
How we want?

11:31.290 --> 11:32.625
Get me something pretty.

11:36.328 --> 11:37.663
He's a player.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.701
If he likes Na-na,
he should fully commit to her.

11:42.134 --> 11:45.571
So I made him into a romantic
who's devoted to one woman.

11:50.843 --> 11:52.344
He's a great singer.

11:53.145 --> 11:55.981
He's got the qualities
that any girl would fall for.

11:57.383 --> 12:00.352
What he lacks is self-confidence.

12:01.687 --> 12:04.290
I don't know much about Elton John,
but I bet he was a ladies' man.

12:05.858 --> 12:07.760
Music is romance!

12:13.399 --> 12:14.233
Sir.

12:14.300 --> 12:17.069
You're under arrest for a noise violation.

12:27.847 --> 12:31.650
I look a bit awkward, don't I?

12:33.619 --> 12:34.620
It suits you.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.624
The Shin Hae-seong I know
has always been a swan.

12:39.725 --> 12:42.561
She thinks she's an ugly duckling,
so she hasn't spread her wings yet.

12:46.499 --> 12:49.034
I want to show you how high you can soar.

12:58.144 --> 13:01.680
I like JB how he is right now,

13:02.748 --> 13:06.318
a regular high school student
just like me.

13:24.703 --> 13:26.238
Roman Holiday. What do you think?

13:27.573 --> 13:28.541
Since I'm a princess--

13:28.607 --> 13:30.309
You should stop acting like one.

13:32.278 --> 13:34.513
Don't pretend you're strong and all.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.049
And lose the dark eye makeup.

13:37.950 --> 13:39.752
Doesn't all that gunk hurt your eyes?

13:40.886 --> 13:42.988
Do you like me?

13:45.291 --> 13:47.626
You might get a chance
if you stop wearing makeup.

13:49.628 --> 13:51.964
Fine. Whatever.

14:07.746 --> 14:08.614
Hey.

14:09.882 --> 14:11.350
The Jin Yu-jin I know

14:12.051 --> 14:14.053
is certainly not B-grade.

14:14.854 --> 14:15.888
He's grade A.

14:16.288 --> 14:17.990
No, more like AA-grade.

14:20.459 --> 14:21.861
I'm not a slab of steak.

14:29.401 --> 14:31.003
Say, "G minor." Two, three!

14:31.070 --> 14:33.405
-G minor
-G minor

15:02.935 --> 15:04.203
Get out of the way.

16:25.985 --> 16:26.852
I'm...

16:28.120 --> 16:29.788
doing the duet with Ailee.

16:29.855 --> 16:30.856
Are you okay with that?

16:36.195 --> 16:38.664
Seul, what's the matter?

16:50.709 --> 16:55.848
To connect with your partner,
there's nothing better than tango.

16:56.949 --> 16:57.883
Mr. Yang.

17:03.689 --> 17:04.723
Make eye contact.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.843
Ahn Tae-yeon, what are you doing here?

17:25.477 --> 17:26.779
Why are you here?

17:27.146 --> 17:28.147
Just look at him.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.349
Mr. Yang is totally not your style.

17:30.849 --> 17:32.718
What do you see in him?

17:34.319 --> 17:35.854
I must have lost my mind.

17:51.870 --> 17:52.905
That's enough.

17:55.140 --> 17:56.308
Not bad.

17:56.675 --> 17:57.676
Not bad at all.

17:58.710 --> 18:00.712
You're all ready, right?

18:04.216 --> 18:05.417
This side first.

18:05.651 --> 18:06.685
-One, two.
-One, two.

18:11.490 --> 18:12.391
Smoothly...

18:27.539 --> 18:28.941
You're just awful.

18:29.675 --> 18:30.943
Come on, guys.

18:31.410 --> 18:32.611
Do this right.

18:33.312 --> 18:34.213
Stick closer together.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.883
The first step is eye contact.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.285
Look at each other with loving eyes.

18:40.352 --> 18:42.254
Come on. Hold hands.

18:42.821 --> 18:44.356
Wrap your arms around his waist.

18:46.725 --> 18:47.593
Come on!

19:29.968 --> 19:31.503
I messed up again, right?

19:31.970 --> 19:32.804
No.

19:33.705 --> 19:35.707
Tango isn't about perfect steps anyway.

19:36.608 --> 19:37.743
You're doing fine.

19:38.844 --> 19:39.845
Should we try again?

19:40.412 --> 19:41.380
-Yes.
-Okay.

19:51.590 --> 19:52.424
Ready?

19:56.061 --> 19:57.629
The key to tango is restraint.

19:58.664 --> 20:00.599
Though your eyes may yearn,

20:01.500 --> 20:04.203
you must maintain tension.

20:18.150 --> 20:19.184
Gosh.

20:19.851 --> 20:20.886
-Let's try that again.
-Okay.

20:21.753 --> 20:24.456
You need to look at him
as you approach him.

20:24.523 --> 20:26.558
You miss the target
because you don't look.

20:26.625 --> 20:28.794
Look. Now, spread your arms.

20:28.860 --> 20:33.232
Don't lose eye contact
as you make your approach. Okay?

20:33.298 --> 20:34.132
-Yes.
-You got it?

20:34.199 --> 20:35.534
-Totally.
-You got the feel of it?

20:35.601 --> 20:37.603
-Yes. I get it completely.
-Okay.

20:38.704 --> 20:39.638
Eye contact.

20:55.721 --> 20:57.789
He wasn't selected
as a super idol for nothing.

20:58.357 --> 21:01.226
Yu-jin's making dramatic progress.

21:01.793 --> 21:05.264
At the rate he's going,
he could go up against JB.

21:06.298 --> 21:10.168
In other words, it'll be Rian
and Hae-seong who will be duking it out.

21:11.670 --> 21:15.007
Hae-seong has improved a lot too, right?
She doesn't fumble as much.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.944
I suppose. She's not a basket case now.

21:19.244 --> 21:22.180
It's the power of love, right?

21:35.560 --> 21:36.461
Start.

21:56.815 --> 22:00.485
Eye contact is crucial
for partner dancing.

22:03.355 --> 22:06.458
We should start off
by practicing our turns and steps.

22:13.699 --> 22:14.533
Two.

22:14.599 --> 22:15.667
One, two, three.

22:15.734 --> 22:16.868
One, two.

22:16.935 --> 22:18.170
One, two, three.

22:18.236 --> 22:19.404
One, two.

22:23.608 --> 22:27.412
Though I warned you,
you've complicated matters.

22:27.779 --> 22:28.980
I'll prove it to you.

22:30.315 --> 22:34.486
I'll prove that I'm fit to be a super idol
through the duet mission.

22:36.288 --> 22:40.359
I'll prove that I can always
make it back up no matter what.

22:42.461 --> 22:45.764
So you're saying you're confident
even though Hae-seong is your partner?

22:46.732 --> 22:47.733
Yes, sir.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.869
Hae-seong and I can do a good job.

22:51.470 --> 22:53.271
Can you be accountable for
what you just said?

22:55.140 --> 22:55.974
Yes.

22:56.475 --> 22:57.609
I'll be held accountable.

22:58.343 --> 23:00.045
You need to be more cautious.

23:01.313 --> 23:02.347
Please have faith in me.

23:03.181 --> 23:07.285
I hope you know
that you can still sink even lower.

23:10.622 --> 23:11.456
Two...

23:19.498 --> 23:20.932
What are you thinking about?

23:23.902 --> 23:24.736
Hae-seong.

23:26.338 --> 23:27.205
Let's...

23:28.840 --> 23:29.808
play hooky.

23:30.509 --> 23:31.343
What?

24:58.997 --> 25:01.132
Let's take a quick break.

25:01.666 --> 25:03.602
We don't have time.

25:03.668 --> 25:05.337
Just for a second.

25:06.104 --> 25:07.973
We're not machines.

25:08.573 --> 25:10.342
Putting in our efforts is important,

25:10.775 --> 25:12.711
but if we overexert ourselves...

25:13.478 --> 25:14.779
If we don't work harder,

25:15.814 --> 25:17.015
we won't be able to catch up.

25:18.917 --> 25:20.452
Don't forget the fact

25:21.052 --> 25:22.654
that I'm a super idol.

25:23.288 --> 25:25.824
I'm not working hard
to catch up with anyone.

25:30.929 --> 25:35.267
Why do you think they picked you
as a super idol?

25:36.935 --> 25:40.505
Because I'm extremely talented.

25:43.074 --> 25:47.078
Why do you think they chose you
as the first super idol

25:48.847 --> 25:49.981
instead of JB?

25:57.188 --> 25:58.823
Where should we go?

26:00.592 --> 26:01.793
Just a second.

26:05.664 --> 26:06.965
I don't have money.

26:11.770 --> 26:12.604
Ta-da.

26:13.738 --> 26:15.240
That's not enough.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.810
This is more than enough.

26:31.623 --> 26:33.358
What do you think?
Do they look good on me?

26:35.360 --> 26:37.295
Maybe they will help you
blend into the crowd.

26:41.232 --> 26:42.067
Let's go.

26:44.836 --> 26:46.071
What are you talking about?

26:46.771 --> 26:48.373
The audition is rigged?

26:50.141 --> 26:51.509
No need to be blown away.

26:52.644 --> 26:56.047
Mr. Lee is capable of a lot of things.

26:58.216 --> 27:01.219
He concocts scandals
and excels at drawing attention.

27:02.721 --> 27:04.489
Rigging an audition is nothing for him.

27:06.157 --> 27:07.559
So the winner will be JB?

27:08.960 --> 27:11.663
Then what about us? What about me?

27:13.832 --> 27:16.568
I'm JB's sidekick,

27:18.136 --> 27:21.339
and you're his pacemaker.

27:22.507 --> 27:23.642
"Pacemaker"?

27:25.910 --> 27:27.579
Do you know what a pacemaker does?

27:28.380 --> 27:29.481
This is only hypothetical.

27:31.082 --> 27:33.184
Suppose you had to be a pacemaker.
What would you do?

27:48.233 --> 27:49.734
I'm sorry, Jin Yu-jin.

27:51.202 --> 27:54.973
But I can't let you be unmotivated.

27:55.874 --> 27:56.908
You need to step things up.

27:59.411 --> 28:00.679
In this audition,

28:02.514 --> 28:03.915
I'll come in first place no matter what.

28:09.721 --> 28:11.456
Liars! Frauds!

28:14.859 --> 28:15.994
Hey, Jin Yu-jin.

28:17.529 --> 28:20.665
Shouldn't you be adding some context
to what you blurted?

28:21.132 --> 28:22.167
Calm down and explain.

28:24.903 --> 28:27.005
The audition is rigged, isn't it?

28:27.505 --> 28:28.973
JB is set to be the winner, isn't he?

28:29.874 --> 28:31.843
Who said I wanted to be a pacemaker?

28:32.477 --> 28:35.814
Is that how you're going to be
talking to me?

28:36.414 --> 28:37.882
-Is it?
-Answer me!

28:39.484 --> 28:42.854
Is it true that the audition results
are already decided?

28:43.154 --> 28:44.522
It's not true at all.

28:45.423 --> 28:47.058
Why should I believe you?

28:47.992 --> 28:50.195
But it is true that you're a pacemaker,

28:51.963 --> 28:54.399
and that you've been doing
a fine job thus far.

28:58.236 --> 29:00.839
Whether you stay a pacemaker
or win the audition

29:01.506 --> 29:02.941
is completely up to you.

29:09.647 --> 29:10.482
CONTRACT

29:10.548 --> 29:12.550
STATEMENT OF CONSENT

29:12.951 --> 29:13.885
What is this?

29:17.255 --> 29:19.691
Your official contract
with Oz Entertainment.

29:20.158 --> 29:21.593
And the parental consent form.

29:23.194 --> 29:25.230
Your mother has agreed
to stay out of your career.

29:29.434 --> 29:30.668
STATEMENT OF CONSENT

29:39.844 --> 29:40.678
AS JIN YU-JIN'S MOTHER,

29:40.745 --> 29:42.847
I AGREE THAT IN REGARD TO
HIS EXCLUSIVE CONTRACT WITH OZ,

29:42.914 --> 29:43.948
I WILL NOT INTERFERE...

29:54.325 --> 29:55.460
I like this song.

30:10.742 --> 30:12.177
-Come and choose.
-How much is this?

30:12.243 --> 30:14.312
-Here.
-Let me see it.

30:14.379 --> 30:16.481
-Take your pick.
-How much is it?

30:16.548 --> 30:17.949
-Come and choose.
-How much is this?

30:18.016 --> 30:19.350
-How about 6,000 won?
-Come and choose.

30:19.417 --> 30:21.452
-Give us a discount.
-No way.

30:21.619 --> 30:23.121
What's its name?

30:23.188 --> 30:25.123
-Jinsun.
-Jinsun?

30:25.190 --> 30:26.024
Hey, there.

30:31.629 --> 30:33.798
Hey. They're total twins.

30:33.865 --> 30:36.367
You're so silly. Get it away from me.

30:36.434 --> 30:37.435
Hold her.

30:43.875 --> 30:44.876
Welcome.

31:09.133 --> 31:10.101
This is so good.

31:15.440 --> 31:16.307
Ta-da.

31:20.578 --> 31:21.446
You look great.

31:23.348 --> 31:25.350
One, two, three, four.

31:25.416 --> 31:28.686
-One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four.

31:29.220 --> 31:32.490
-One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four.

31:34.626 --> 31:35.560
Here you go.

31:36.294 --> 31:38.429
-Thank you.
-Have a good day.

31:40.465 --> 31:41.299
Here.

31:45.069 --> 31:45.904
What are these for?

31:46.971 --> 31:47.839
It's a present.

31:50.341 --> 31:54.045
I've gotten lots of presents,
but this is a first.

31:55.914 --> 31:59.050
I'm thanking you
for drawing me like a chopstick

31:59.384 --> 32:01.719
when I'm more like a spoon.

32:02.654 --> 32:04.555
But that...

32:05.657 --> 32:06.824
I'm just kidding.

32:08.226 --> 32:12.096
I know how much you like to eat.
This is so that you never starve.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.101
Well, these are for you.

32:22.340 --> 32:26.511
A spoon always goes
with a pair of chopsticks, right?

32:26.577 --> 32:27.712
Like needle and thread.

32:29.113 --> 32:29.948
So...

32:30.848 --> 32:32.450
we should always stay together too.

32:35.286 --> 32:36.220
Is that weird?

33:42.820 --> 33:45.289
I can't stomach this.

33:46.858 --> 33:49.027
How about we switch...

33:49.627 --> 33:50.928
Don't even think about it.

33:53.131 --> 33:56.167
Na-na, can't I just practice with you?

33:56.868 --> 34:01.539
I'll try my best not to puke
on the day of the duet.

34:02.273 --> 34:03.808
I just can't focus.

34:06.077 --> 34:08.880
Should I make myself
sound more like a girl?

34:09.414 --> 34:11.449
Like that would change anything?

34:12.717 --> 34:15.053
This is for the best. Trust me.

36:00.558 --> 36:03.261
Didn't my mother say anything?

36:05.163 --> 36:06.931
She stamped her seal, and that was it?

36:08.232 --> 36:10.101
She said that was all
she could do for you.

36:11.135 --> 36:13.337
She was too ashamed to face you.

36:14.338 --> 36:16.174
She wants all the best for you.

36:40.131 --> 36:41.332
Damn it!

37:26.978 --> 37:28.179
Jin Yu-jin.

37:36.587 --> 37:37.722
Is something wrong?

37:38.489 --> 37:39.790
I'm not in the mood to talk.

37:45.830 --> 37:47.064
How about a game?

37:54.438 --> 37:55.539
How about a free throw match?

37:56.674 --> 37:57.642
A free throw?

37:58.009 --> 38:00.311
Just get it in from here.

38:01.879 --> 38:03.047
What should we bet on?

38:03.114 --> 38:04.215
Just get it in.

38:04.615 --> 38:07.551
I'll give you whatever you want,
just name it.

38:09.253 --> 38:10.087
Really?

38:11.822 --> 38:15.259
But if you fail, Shin Hae-seong is mine.

38:24.335 --> 38:25.303
What are you talking about?

38:37.048 --> 38:38.482
Do you think you're all that?

38:38.916 --> 38:42.119
You think the world revolves
around you, don't you?

38:42.253 --> 38:43.387
Jin Yu-jin!

38:46.057 --> 38:50.161
What gives you the right to use me?

38:50.828 --> 38:52.063
A pacemaker?

38:54.031 --> 38:56.300
Why should I be your pacemaker?

38:57.268 --> 38:58.636
You knew, didn't you?

39:00.871 --> 39:02.173
Answer me!

39:05.276 --> 39:06.344
I knew about it.

39:16.153 --> 39:18.889
Stop it!

39:20.291 --> 39:24.929
You should dodge the punches.
Why are you just taking it?

39:25.396 --> 39:27.531
I know I can't run away from this anyway.

39:32.136 --> 39:33.270
I know how you feel.

39:35.573 --> 39:36.407
But...

39:37.408 --> 39:38.509
don't run away.

39:40.244 --> 39:41.879
Even if you have to face the worst,

39:43.914 --> 39:44.882
you have to hang in there.

39:55.559 --> 39:56.527
Are you okay?

40:39.937 --> 40:43.307
I have something to give you.

40:43.874 --> 40:44.708
For me?

40:58.956 --> 40:59.857
Thanks.

41:04.395 --> 41:05.396
Aren't you going to ask

41:06.597 --> 41:08.899
why Yu-jin acted like that?

41:11.602 --> 41:12.636
I am curious.

41:15.105 --> 41:15.973
But...

41:17.775 --> 41:18.909
I trust you.

41:24.215 --> 41:25.049
You must be cold.

41:25.549 --> 41:26.383
Should we go in?

41:26.984 --> 41:28.085
Let's stay here for a bit.

41:31.589 --> 41:33.257
There are no stars tonight.

41:39.330 --> 41:42.032
You know what?

41:45.603 --> 41:49.673
When I'm with you,

41:51.775 --> 41:53.277
I feel like I'm dreaming.

41:56.847 --> 41:57.681
A dream...

41:59.650 --> 42:00.985
that I won't be able to dream again.

42:34.285 --> 42:35.386
It's not a dream anymore.

42:43.694 --> 42:46.330
-Look. A star!
-Where?

42:47.831 --> 42:51.802
It's right over...

42:51.869 --> 42:52.703
here.

44:20.991 --> 44:23.227
I heard about your father.

44:26.664 --> 44:28.132
He would have been so happy

44:29.600 --> 44:31.168
to see your debut performance.

44:34.938 --> 44:37.041
He looked forward to it so much...

44:47.818 --> 44:48.652
Let's...

44:50.788 --> 44:51.755
break up.

44:58.662 --> 45:00.164
I promised my dad

45:02.466 --> 45:03.767
I would be the best.

45:06.637 --> 45:08.038
I couldn't be with him when he died

45:09.206 --> 45:10.808
because of my TV debut.

45:17.314 --> 45:19.016
I have to become the best,

45:21.785 --> 45:23.687
so I can keep my word.

45:40.237 --> 45:42.039
You're the one who broke that promise.

45:45.008 --> 45:46.543
I'll become a big star.

45:48.312 --> 45:49.680
When that day comes, I'll ask you

45:52.549 --> 45:53.984
why you can't be with me

45:56.253 --> 45:58.989
but you can with Shin Hae-seong.

46:14.938 --> 46:16.340
All right! We're going fifth.

46:28.318 --> 46:29.219
We're going fourth.

46:30.287 --> 46:31.588
-Perfect, right?
-Yes.

46:36.827 --> 46:39.029
Not what we hoped for.

46:40.030 --> 46:41.198
-This blows.
-Jeez.

46:43.133 --> 46:44.868
I guess we're going third.

46:51.375 --> 46:52.209
What?

46:53.210 --> 46:55.045
Let's switch orders.

46:56.180 --> 46:57.447
What's your number?

46:59.449 --> 47:01.151
-We're going first.
-First?

47:01.218 --> 47:03.854
No way. That's too much pressure.

47:04.354 --> 47:07.558
Your song is upbeat.
It's a perfect opener.

47:08.892 --> 47:11.695
We really have to perform at the end.

47:12.362 --> 47:13.730
Please.

47:14.097 --> 47:16.834
Just this once. Please?

47:16.900 --> 47:17.734
Ui-bong.

47:24.141 --> 47:24.975
Here you go.

47:25.542 --> 47:26.410
Here.

47:26.977 --> 47:27.811
Good luck.

47:28.946 --> 47:29.780
Thanks.

47:31.014 --> 47:31.849
Thanks.

47:34.718 --> 47:35.586
Number five.

47:42.559 --> 47:45.028
What kind of serenade
would you like to receive?

47:45.929 --> 47:47.631
Regardless of how you express it,

47:48.532 --> 47:51.435
there's probably nothing
sweeter or more beautiful

47:51.768 --> 47:54.071
than professing love for another person.

47:54.905 --> 47:57.774
But not all confessions of love
are successful.

47:59.009 --> 48:03.280
Let's find out which contestant
will manage to tug at your heartstrings.

50:32.963 --> 50:35.699
One, two.

50:35.766 --> 50:36.600
One...

50:41.471 --> 50:43.173
You gave this to JB, didn't you?

50:47.244 --> 50:50.781
I did. It's a long story.

50:53.216 --> 50:54.418
You must be big on recycling.

50:55.585 --> 50:57.521
Seeing how you give away people's trash.

50:58.755 --> 51:00.157
What is it that you want to say?

51:02.359 --> 51:03.827
Just like this pendant,

51:05.762 --> 51:07.164
you can have JB.

51:11.001 --> 51:13.270
Since I've thrown him away...

51:15.739 --> 51:17.240
he's all yours.

51:20.777 --> 51:22.012
I know you don't mean that.

51:26.783 --> 51:27.951
You care about JB

51:28.652 --> 51:29.986
more than anyone else.

51:31.955 --> 51:35.559
You told me to say no
if he picked me as a partner

51:35.625 --> 51:37.828
because you were concerned about him.

51:39.863 --> 51:41.298
It's all in the past.

51:43.400 --> 51:45.202
Whether you like it or not,

51:47.137 --> 51:50.440
you'll end up hurting him.

51:53.276 --> 51:55.479
Why do you say that?

51:57.514 --> 51:59.983
It's as though you want him to get hurt.

52:02.152 --> 52:04.788
I'll protect him.

52:05.956 --> 52:07.190
I'll make sure he doesn't get hurt.

52:13.530 --> 52:14.865
I hope you can do that.

55:23.386 --> 55:25.455
I had no idea
there was this side to Hae-seong.

55:26.089 --> 55:30.226
She looks so pretty.
She's sparkling like a star.

55:32.295 --> 55:34.197
Are Hae-seong and JB dating?

55:34.597 --> 55:35.832
They make a good couple.

55:36.633 --> 55:39.536
But what about Rian? Wasn't she seeing JB?

55:39.602 --> 55:40.570
I don't know.

57:24.974 --> 57:26.342
Is Rian crying?

57:28.845 --> 57:30.280
It must be true.

57:30.346 --> 57:32.115
JB really must have dumped her.

57:33.450 --> 57:35.084
I feel so sorry for Rian.

57:35.752 --> 57:39.622
Don't you think Rian strategically
switched their performance order?

57:41.057 --> 57:42.125
What do you mean?

57:42.659 --> 57:44.527
It wasn't because she wanted to go last.

57:45.628 --> 57:49.532
She wanted to perform
right after JB and Hae-seong.

57:54.103 --> 57:56.172
The audience loved
JB and Hae-seong's performance.

57:58.041 --> 58:00.076
But Rian just turned everyone
against them.

58:42.785 --> 58:44.220
Do you have a song in mind?

58:46.756 --> 58:47.991
Serenade.

58:48.358 --> 58:49.192
Romance.

58:51.494 --> 58:52.362
Love...

58:52.896 --> 58:54.831
isn't always sweet, is it?

58:56.199 --> 58:57.200
What do you mean?

59:01.704 --> 59:02.672
You just watch.

59:04.340 --> 59:06.342
I'm going to make everyone side with me.

59:23.326 --> 59:27.397
Was there a serenade
that really moved you?

59:28.598 --> 59:32.468
Your votes will determine
the fate of the contestants.

59:34.203 --> 59:37.807
Before announcing the winning team,

59:39.175 --> 59:44.113
I will announce
the lowest-scoring contestant.

59:48.384 --> 59:50.320
Today's lowest-scoring person

59:50.887 --> 59:54.624
will be eliminated
from the Super Idol Audition.

59:59.996 --> 1:00:02.231
What? Did I hear that correctly?

1:00:02.599 --> 1:00:05.501
But HershE and I:dn kids
went into this with penalty deductions.

1:00:06.102 --> 1:00:07.103
It's insane.

1:00:07.170 --> 1:00:09.439
Why didn't he tell everyone
about the elimination condition?

1:00:10.940 --> 1:00:13.242
This was a serenade mission, right?

1:00:14.811 --> 1:00:20.683
The serenades you sang
are like love letters in a way.

1:00:22.619 --> 1:00:28.458
But no matter how long a love letter is
or how beautifully it's written,

1:00:29.125 --> 1:00:31.427
if your beloved rejects you,

1:00:32.161 --> 1:00:35.932
the letter becomes nothing more
than mindless, useless scribbling.

1:00:37.900 --> 1:00:40.870
There was no hidden meaning
to this mission.

1:00:41.804 --> 1:00:43.606
Serenade...

1:00:44.574 --> 1:00:49.112
If a serenade fails,
you can't ever see your beloved again.

1:00:52.649 --> 1:00:54.050
Like I just said,

1:00:54.617 --> 1:00:56.285
this will be the end

1:00:56.653 --> 1:00:59.122
for one of the contestants
standing before you.

1:01:01.290 --> 1:01:04.127
Once I announce the result,
the person whose name is called

1:01:04.861 --> 1:01:06.663
will realize what a great thing
he or she has lost.

1:01:08.131 --> 1:01:12.001
I will now announce
our lowest-scoring contestant.

1:01:24.147 --> 1:01:25.581
The contestant to be eliminated...

1:01:33.556 --> 1:01:34.857
The contestant to be eliminated is...

1:01:37.727 --> 1:01:38.695
JB.
