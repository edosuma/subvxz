00:08.670 --> 00:10.140
-Yes.
-Was an Ancient?

00:10.240 --> 00:11.230
I think so.

00:11.340 --> 00:14.540
What does this have to do
with where this alleged treasure is buried?

00:14.640 --> 00:17.010
JACKSON: Certain threads point
to the Knights ofthe Round Table.

00:17.110 --> 00:19.550
Gathering great treasures
from the far corners of Arthur's domain

00:19.650 --> 00:22.140
and hiding them in a magical stronghold
at A valon.

still working on that thing.

01:02.120 --> 01:03.350
Oh, hi.

01:05.160 --> 01:08.030
-Did you sleep here last night?
-Of course not.

01:08.430 --> 01:12.330
-I slept down the hall in my quarters.
-Sam.

01:12.870 --> 01:15.360
This device was recovered
from the cave under Glastonbury.

01:15.470 --> 01:17.460
Who knows
what Ancient secrets it may hold.

01:17.570 --> 01:20.470
Well, obviously not you or Dr. Lee,

01:20.580 --> 01:23.980
who's been working on that thing for,
what, six months?

01:24.250 --> 01:27.910
I think it's time we let the eggheads
at Area 51 take a crack at it.

01:28.020 --> 01:31.040
Not yet.
I'm actually making some progress here.

01:32.020 --> 01:34.320
That's what you said last night.

01:35.020 --> 01:39.120
And I'm hankering for hash browns.
So let's go grab some breakfast.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.790
Hey, this is interesting.

01:42.930 --> 01:47.060
This is the first time one of my verification
scans kicked back a positive result.

01:47.170 --> 01:49.830
Does this mean
I'm not getting my hash browns?

01:49.940 --> 01:52.430
It means this device is interactive.

01:53.010 --> 01:55.500
I'm reading an EM output
that keeps fluctuating

01:55.610 --> 01:57.670
between high and low frequencies.

01:57.980 --> 02:01.810
-I'm gonna try to stabilize it.
-Sure. What have you got to lose?

03:21.900 --> 03:24.560
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

03:36.280 --> 03:39.740
-My Ancient's a little rusty.
-Right. We need Jackson.

03:42.050 --> 03:44.850
Hey, Bill, good timing. Take a look at this.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.030
Yo, doc, amazing discovery over here.

04:02.640 --> 04:04.260
Oh! What the hell?

04:11.080 --> 04:13.740
-What was that?
-I don't know.

04:20.290 --> 04:21.780
Okay, you're solid.

04:27.860 --> 04:29.190
CARTER: It's the device.

04:29.760 --> 04:33.600
By initiating it, we must have
triggered some sort of localized effect.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.600
-Local meaning you and me?
-Yeah.

04:40.110 --> 04:42.080
Try picking up that coffee cup.

04:48.620 --> 04:51.240
Oh, boy. We need to find Daniel.

04:51.350 --> 04:53.220
"Out of phase." What does that mean?

04:53.320 --> 04:55.590
It means we may have shifted
to an alternate dimension.

04:55.690 --> 04:57.720
And there are an infinite number
of alternate dimensions.

04:57.830 --> 04:59.490
No, no. That's alternate realities.

04:59.590 --> 05:03.260
-So, when the other SG-1 showed up...
-Completely different problem.

05:03.670 --> 05:06.790
See, according to M-theory,
that unites the five superstring theories,

05:06.900 --> 05:09.460
there are several spatial dimensions.

05:09.570 --> 05:13.060
Eleven, actually, that exist in parallel
with our physical realities.

05:13.310 --> 05:15.940
-Now, these higher dimensions...
-No, I'll take your word for it.

05:16.040 --> 05:18.670
That was alternate reality.
This is alternate dimension.

05:18.780 --> 05:20.680
Hell, all I need
is a good time travel adventure

05:20.780 --> 05:22.880
and I've scored the SG-1 trifecta.

05:23.080 --> 05:24.680
Now, how is Jackson supposed
to help us with this?

05:24.790 --> 05:27.780
Well, a similar thing happened to him
a few years ago.

05:29.890 --> 05:31.860
PX7-377, the crystal skull!

05:32.660 --> 05:34.220
You really did read every report

05:34.330 --> 05:35.890
from every mission we ever went on,
didn't you?

05:36.000 --> 05:39.430
I was in that hospital a long time,
and they were all riveting.

05:39.530 --> 05:41.930
Anyway, when Daniel was out of phase
and nobody could see him

05:42.040 --> 05:44.560
except for his grandfather,
Nicholas Ballard.

05:45.170 --> 05:47.940
And because the same thing happened
to Ballard in Belize,

05:48.040 --> 05:51.440
Jackson should be able to see us
because we're all part of the same club.

05:51.550 --> 05:54.070
-Right.
-Perfect.

05:55.950 --> 05:57.420
(WATER RUNNING)

06:01.290 --> 06:03.620
Teal'c, have you seen Colonel Mitchell?

06:03.960 --> 06:06.860
-No, I have not.
-I'm gonna need to talk to your team.

06:06.960 --> 06:10.950
SG-12 just got back from P8T-474,
and it looks like we may have

06:11.070 --> 06:14.230
a timeline for whatever it is
the Priors are planning.

06:14.870 --> 06:18.830
According to the natives, this "Doomsday"
the Priors keep talking about

06:19.270 --> 06:21.110
may be only days away.

06:21.980 --> 06:23.940
I will inform the others.

06:32.250 --> 06:35.280
Jackson, just the guy to help us
with a little problem.

06:38.190 --> 06:39.350
Or not.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.660
The dimension we're occupying
must be different

06:42.760 --> 06:44.730
from the one he was shifted to.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.900
-Alternate, alternate dimensions?
-Something like that, yeah.

06:50.470 --> 06:52.870
Okay, so what do we do?

06:54.710 --> 06:57.370
We have to find a way
to communicate with them.

06:58.910 --> 06:59.940
Any ideas?

in the data stream.

07:21.370 --> 07:23.340
-I'm not sure, sir.
-LANDRY: Can you clean it up?

07:23.440 --> 07:24.870
I can try, sir.

07:26.110 --> 07:27.300
(THUDDING)

07:29.880 --> 07:32.440
Okay, that sounded
like something hitting the iris.

07:32.550 --> 07:35.910
-Any way to know for sure what it was?
-HARRlMAN: We can run some tests.

07:36.380 --> 07:39.580
Do it. Get Colonel Carter down here
to help unscramble that message.

07:39.690 --> 07:40.710
Yes, sir.

07:50.160 --> 07:51.760
I can't make heads or tails of this.

07:51.870 --> 07:54.990
That's because the filter coefficient
has to be adaptive.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.000
The filter coefficient has to be adaptive.

08:00.840 --> 08:02.540
-Hey, wait a minute.
-There you go.

08:02.640 --> 08:05.080
Notice the slight variance in the output.

08:06.380 --> 08:07.580
Notice it?

08:09.380 --> 08:11.080
Come on! Notice it!

08:12.920 --> 08:14.510
-Never mind.
-Gosh!

08:20.630 --> 08:22.220
What do you mean, they're missing?

08:22.330 --> 08:23.390
They are not in their quarters,

08:23.500 --> 08:26.160
nor are they responding
to any attempt to contact them.

08:26.270 --> 08:28.170
Is it possible they aren't even on the base?

08:28.270 --> 08:30.360
We checked the front gate,
neither of them signed out.

08:30.470 --> 08:32.700
-What about security footage?
-We're reviewing tapes

08:32.810 --> 08:35.710
for both the labs and the cafeteria,
but beyond that,

08:35.810 --> 08:39.410
well, there are hundreds of cameras
and hours of tape so...

08:40.150 --> 08:43.640
We'll screen them all if we have to.
I want them found.

08:49.720 --> 08:53.130
Boy, am I getting that
Patrick Swayze in Ghostfeeling.

08:56.430 --> 08:59.130
General, we need a Whoopi.

09:07.980 --> 09:09.140
Walter.

09:09.240 --> 09:11.940
-We managed to clean up the message, sir.
-Finally.

09:12.050 --> 09:13.880
HARRlMAN: We noticed
a slight variance in the output,

09:13.980 --> 09:16.210
so we ran it through
a sequence of digital filters,

09:16.320 --> 09:18.010
and we came up with this.

09:19.120 --> 09:22.110
MAN ON RECORDING: Stargate Command.
This is Sodan. PIease respond.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.920
-Did he say Sodan?
-...under attack.

09:24.030 --> 09:27.020
Many have fallen.
We request immediate assistance.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.350
That's when we heard the impact
against the iris, sir.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.230
General Landry, we should investigate.

09:32.330 --> 09:34.230
Agreed. Assemble a team.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.160
Sir, Colonel Mitchell
is the one who should go.

09:36.270 --> 09:38.260
He's the one
who knows the Sodan the best.

09:38.370 --> 09:41.570
I agree, but Colonel Mitchell
isn't here right now.

09:49.020 --> 09:50.420
Hey, have you seen Colonel Carter?

09:50.520 --> 09:52.320
Hey, I was just coming
to ask you the same thing.

09:52.420 --> 09:54.650
Really?
Because she left her laptop in my lab.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.220
-She did?
-Yeah, yeah.

09:56.320 --> 09:59.820
It's hooked up to that device
that you picked up in Glastonbury.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.230
There she is.

10:10.300 --> 10:11.500
Fast forward.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.770
There's Colonel Mitchell.

10:28.420 --> 10:29.790
What just happened?

10:29.890 --> 10:33.520
Looks like the camera went offline.
Probably a power surge.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.230
They're gone.

10:43.240 --> 10:47.230
Okay, bring up the security camera
for the corridor outside Dr. Lee's lab.

10:47.780 --> 10:51.580
Sync them up to 8:16,
and run them simultaneously.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.890
Okay, if they didn't go
through the doorway,

11:10.430 --> 11:12.590
how did they get out of the room?

11:26.550 --> 11:28.850
More staff blasts,
just like back at the gate.

11:28.950 --> 11:32.040
Indeed. A battle took place here as well.

11:33.620 --> 11:36.450
The Sodan have been hiding here
for thousands of years.

11:36.560 --> 11:38.250
The only reason
we got the transporter codes

11:38.360 --> 11:40.790
is because Colonel Mitchell
won their trust.

11:40.930 --> 11:43.020
I doubt they would've given them
to anyone else.

11:43.130 --> 11:45.390
And yet, evidently they were attacked.

11:45.800 --> 11:46.960
By who?

12:06.390 --> 12:07.550
My God.

12:08.990 --> 12:11.390
Conway, Stevens,
get back to the gate on the double.

12:11.490 --> 12:14.020
-Tell SGC we need med teams.
-Yes, sir.

13:18.660 --> 13:19.650
Pulse is weak.

13:19.760 --> 13:22.350
He will not survive long.
His symbiote is dead.

13:22.460 --> 13:25.400
Lieutenant, help me get him
into one of these huts.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.970
We need to get some tretonin in him, stat.

13:32.170 --> 13:33.270
Roast beef.

13:33.470 --> 13:36.970
The one time I can't eat,
and they serve roast beef.

13:37.080 --> 13:40.210
Do know how many times
I've requested roast beef?

13:41.250 --> 13:44.220
-This is torture.
-It's only been a few hours.

13:44.850 --> 13:47.050
You're not the least
bit concerned about this?

13:47.150 --> 13:48.140
No one can see us or hear us.

13:48.260 --> 13:52.350
We can't touch anything,
ergo, no eating, no drinking

13:52.460 --> 13:54.830
and I'm not gonna speculate
on the other bodily functions.

13:54.930 --> 13:57.830
If they don't figure out a way
to get us back...

13:57.930 --> 13:59.230
They'll figure it out.

14:09.610 --> 14:11.010
What have you got, Doctor?

14:11.110 --> 14:15.310
Well, we know that Sam
was working on the device.

14:15.450 --> 14:18.750
We know the device does not give off
any typical energy signatures

14:18.850 --> 14:21.790
emitted by Ancient
transporter technology.

14:21.890 --> 14:23.690
This leads us to the conclusion

14:23.790 --> 14:26.850
that they disappeared
without leaving the room.

14:27.390 --> 14:28.760
How's that possible?

14:33.430 --> 14:34.990
Miniaturization.

14:36.470 --> 14:37.700
Don't panic.

14:37.810 --> 14:41.570
I have calculated the distance
they could possibly travel on tiny legs

14:41.680 --> 14:44.080
designated by this roped-off area.

14:44.180 --> 14:46.150
All we have to do is find them.

14:46.310 --> 14:48.750
Ronald, start with section 1A.

14:59.130 --> 15:01.620
I was unable to locate any other survivors.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.360
What is his condition?

15:05.470 --> 15:07.400
We don't know
if the tretonin's gonna take.

15:07.500 --> 15:10.630
Even then, his injuries are pretty severe.

15:12.570 --> 15:14.040
Without a symbiote.

15:15.010 --> 15:16.170

15:31.490 --> 15:33.050
You shouldn't be here.

15:33.590 --> 15:38.050
Tell me who has done this.
Tell me who has caused this devastation.

15:40.230 --> 15:41.390
Volnek.

15:42.940 --> 15:44.560
It was Volnek.

15:45.510 --> 15:47.130
One man did this?

15:49.480 --> 15:51.470
Why would he turn on his people?

15:52.080 --> 15:54.510
Tell me. Haikon.

16:19.910 --> 16:22.740
Oh, come on. It was just a theory.

16:22.840 --> 16:25.310
Anyway, If I'd been right you'd all be
calling me a genius right now.

16:25.410 --> 16:27.310
Yes, but you weren't right.

-So, anything?
-Nothing significant.

-What?
-What?

16:42.060 --> 16:43.320
Lepton radiation?

16:44.870 --> 16:46.770
Lepton. Lepton radiation?

16:46.870 --> 16:51.000
Yeah, but like I said, only traces.
I mean, there's nothing significant there.

16:51.110 --> 16:52.330
Gotta go.

16:55.340 --> 16:56.370
Stevens!

17:00.980 --> 17:02.610
This one is alive.

17:11.230 --> 17:12.750
I never saw...

17:14.760 --> 17:17.200
The shots came out of nowhere.

17:18.170 --> 17:20.400
No doubt Volnek is using a Sodan cloak.

17:21.140 --> 17:23.500
We gotta get him back to the gate now.

17:28.140 --> 17:29.470
(BEEPING)

17:33.280 --> 17:34.610
What's wrong?

17:36.680 --> 17:38.350
The code is not working.

17:50.900 --> 17:53.590
Someone has removed
one of the control crystals.

17:54.070 --> 17:56.560
Then how are we supposed
to get out of here?

17:57.640 --> 17:58.760
We cannot.

18:05.210 --> 18:09.150
Come on, Jackson, figure it out.
I've already missed breakfast and lunch.

18:09.620 --> 18:11.640
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

18:11.950 --> 18:13.510
-General.
-Dr. Jackson.

18:13.620 --> 18:17.060
I just came from Dr. Lee's lab.
Please tell me you have better news.

18:17.160 --> 18:18.520
I've been going over some of the texts

18:18.630 --> 18:20.290
we recovered
from the cave in Glastonbury.

18:20.390 --> 18:21.380
And?

18:21.500 --> 18:24.190
Well, a lot of them seem to make oblique
references to Arthurian legend.

18:24.300 --> 18:26.960
For instance, the word "anwin"
which shows up several times is,

18:27.070 --> 18:30.090
I believe, a variation on "Unwin,"
the Celtic Underworld,

18:30.200 --> 18:33.470
where King Arthur journeyed
in search of 13 sacred objects.

18:33.670 --> 18:35.400
One of which was a cloak.

18:35.510 --> 18:37.200
What? The picture of the guy
with the big, blowing robes?

18:37.310 --> 18:39.010
Said to render the wearer invisible.

18:39.110 --> 18:41.640
It was called "The Mantle of Arthur"
and was kept at Barnsey lsland

18:41.750 --> 18:44.840
by none other than our good friend,
Myrddin, whom we know better as...

18:44.950 --> 18:46.390
-Merlin.
-Exactly.

18:47.120 --> 18:50.320
-I've no idea where you're going with this.
-Me either.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.860
It wasn't until Dr. Lee told me
that he detected trace amounts

18:52.960 --> 18:55.590
of lepton radiation from the device
that I was able to put it together.

18:55.700 --> 18:59.290
You see, the crystal skull that
transported me to another dimension

18:59.400 --> 19:01.270
also released lepton radiation.

19:01.370 --> 19:04.360
And you think the same thing happened
to Colonel Carter and Colonel Mitchell?

19:04.470 --> 19:05.460
You're damn right!

19:05.570 --> 19:08.130
According to legend,
the mantle makes the user invisible.

19:08.240 --> 19:10.230
Now, given what I've read
and what's happened today,

19:10.340 --> 19:12.510
I'm guessing it wasn't
literally a cloak at all.

19:12.610 --> 19:15.710
-lt was the device we recovered.
-lt makes sense, sir.

19:15.820 --> 19:17.040
Medieval historians
could well have attributed

19:17.150 --> 19:19.810
the powers of the device to a cloak
simply because they didn't understand it,

19:19.920 --> 19:22.650
and they could've credited its recovery
to Arthur out of deference to the king

19:22.760 --> 19:23.810
who was in power at the time.

19:23.920 --> 19:25.890
Now, given what we know now
it seems much more likely

19:25.990 --> 19:28.390
that it was Merlin
who actually built the device.

19:28.500 --> 19:32.930
So, why would Merlin build a device that
could transport him to another dimension?

19:33.030 --> 19:34.520
Today's daily double.

19:35.270 --> 19:37.600
Yeah, that's the part
I haven't quite figured out yet.

19:37.700 --> 19:38.670
Close.

19:38.770 --> 19:40.930
But at least it points to the possibility that

19:41.040 --> 19:45.100
both Colonel Mitchell and Colonel Carter
may still be somewhere here on this base.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.970
We just can't see or hear them.

20:04.230 --> 20:06.720
HADDEN: We could make our way back
to the gate on foot.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.600
I do not believe that would be wise.

20:08.700 --> 20:11.870
The journey would take months
and the terrain is most treacherous.

20:11.970 --> 20:13.410
There's not much for us here.

20:13.510 --> 20:16.270
We're gonna run out
of supplies before long.

20:18.180 --> 20:19.870
General Landry
will send an extraction team

20:19.980 --> 20:21.070
when we fail to report.

20:21.180 --> 20:23.840
And they'll end up stranded here,
just like us.

20:26.690 --> 20:29.680
We have food for the moment,
and we can build shelter.

20:29.990 --> 20:33.650
Perhaps when the extraction team arrives,
we can repair the obelisk.

20:34.360 --> 20:37.300
What about Volnek? He's still out there.

20:37.400 --> 20:40.130
-Leave him to me.
-Teal'c,

20:42.640 --> 20:44.660
he took out an entire village.

20:45.470 --> 20:48.030
It is my understanding that those
who use a Sodan cloaking device

20:48.140 --> 20:50.540
are invisible to everyone but each other.

20:50.940 --> 20:53.940
So if you use that thing,
you'll be able to see him.

20:54.210 --> 20:55.370
Indeed.

20:56.450 --> 20:59.040
Didn't help that guy much, though, did it?

21:13.900 --> 21:14.890
JACKSON: Now, when I was out of phase,

21:15.000 --> 21:16.870
I could see and hear everything
going on around me,

21:16.970 --> 21:18.960
so it follows if they're
in the same situation,

21:19.070 --> 21:20.660
they're hearing
what we're saying right now.

21:20.770 --> 21:24.040
-Except they can't respond.
-Maybe they can. They just don't know it.

21:24.140 --> 21:26.540
Now what does that look like to you?
First reaction.

21:26.650 --> 21:30.010
A keyboard.
Except there's no visual interface.

21:30.280 --> 21:33.690
-Not here.
-You mean, it's on the other side?

21:33.790 --> 21:37.190
It stands to reason that Merlin would want
the device to be interactive on both sides,

21:37.290 --> 21:38.420
this and the alternate dimension.

21:38.530 --> 21:40.930
Now, the interactivity on this side
is difficult to access,

21:41.030 --> 21:44.660
now, I'm guessing as a type of safeguard
against just anyone using the device.

21:44.770 --> 21:47.760
But there'd be no reason
to hide it on the other side.

21:47.970 --> 21:50.960
-Whoa, whoa, did you see that?
-Oh, yeah.

21:51.740 --> 21:55.470
-Yeah!
-Sam, Mitchell,

21:55.940 --> 21:57.640
if you can hear me...

21:58.480 --> 22:01.640
Okay, let's call this button
"yes" and this button "no."

22:03.880 --> 22:05.680
Okay, first question,

22:07.050 --> 22:08.950
-are you guys okay?
-Yes.

22:09.590 --> 22:12.680
Yes, oh, thank God.
I mean, now we're getting somewhere.

22:12.790 --> 22:17.360
Okay, besides the interactivity, is
there anything else unusual on your end?

22:18.600 --> 22:19.730
Yes.

22:20.070 --> 22:22.590
-Something connected to the device?
-Would you call it connected?

22:22.700 --> 22:24.100
-Yes, yes.
-Yes.

22:25.270 --> 22:28.040
Yes. Is it some sort of display?

22:29.180 --> 22:32.670
-But that's... That's "emphatic yes."
-Okay, thought so.

22:33.150 --> 22:34.480
Can you read it?

22:40.650 --> 22:42.420
It's in Ancient, isn't it?

22:46.790 --> 22:49.460
Okay. All right.

22:51.470 --> 22:52.490
Now,

22:54.030 --> 22:56.300
you guys are gonna have
to help me translate what you see

22:56.400 --> 22:59.170
but you see, we don't know
what pressing buttons randomly will do,

22:59.270 --> 23:02.830
so we're going to have to stick
with "yes" and "no" and just do it,

23:03.210 --> 23:04.970
one letter at a time.

23:05.080 --> 23:07.410
-LANDRY: This is gonna take a while?
-Oh, yeah.

23:07.510 --> 23:09.910
-Well, just keep me posted.
-Yes, sir.

23:11.990 --> 23:13.920
Okay, first letter.

23:40.810 --> 23:42.210
(ELECTRONIC BUZZING)

23:57.560 --> 24:01.230
-Status?
-Still no word from Teal'c or SG-12.

24:01.340 --> 24:03.860
-How long are they overdue?
-Over an hour.

24:03.970 --> 24:06.370
Tell Colonel Reynolds
to prep an extraction team.

24:06.470 --> 24:09.200
-Have them ready to move out ASAP.
-Yes, sir.

24:16.580 --> 24:20.780
Okay. First letter, next word.
Stop me when you see the right symbol.

24:22.120 --> 24:23.990
-How's it going?
-Fantastic.

24:24.090 --> 24:26.030
We've almost completed
the first sentence.

24:26.130 --> 24:28.490
Listen, do you think you'll be okay
on your own here for a while?

24:28.600 --> 24:29.720
Sure, why?

24:30.330 --> 24:32.260
We've lost contact with Teal'c.

24:32.570 --> 24:35.690
Landry's sending SG-3 and 22
to check on him at the Sodan village.

24:35.800 --> 24:38.460
-I figured I'd tag along.
-Offworld?

24:38.840 --> 24:41.270
Yeah, well, Jackson was able
to travel through the gate

24:41.380 --> 24:43.500
when he was out of phase, so, yeah.

24:44.910 --> 24:48.010
Well, that's my point. You're out of phase.
What do you hope to accomplish?

24:48.120 --> 24:51.380
Sam, Teal'c could be in trouble.
I wanna check it out.

24:51.850 --> 24:53.980
No one can see me, I can't get hurt.

24:55.260 --> 24:57.850
I can gather intel that no one else can.

24:59.730 --> 25:01.560
Sam? Mitchell? Did you see it?

25:01.660 --> 25:02.790
Listen,

25:02.900 --> 25:06.300
I promise I'll come back through the gate
when they dial to check in.

25:06.400 --> 25:10.200
-I'll only be gone a couple of hours.
-Hello, are you guys still there?

25:10.300 --> 25:13.570
-Cameron...
-Sam, Teal'c may need help,

25:14.640 --> 25:16.770
and I have friends among the Sodan.

25:17.780 --> 25:20.300
I'll be back soon, promise.

25:21.980 --> 25:25.820
Like, slap a button or something.
Okay, thank you.

25:26.920 --> 25:27.890
(SIGHS)

25:28.990 --> 25:32.790
First letter, next word, and stop me
when you see the right symbol.

26:00.690 --> 26:02.380
(LEAVES RUSTLING)

26:40.490 --> 26:41.720
(ROARING)

26:52.340 --> 26:56.140
-Yes, okay. Next word.
-LEE: That's it!

26:57.980 --> 27:02.140
I got it. I finally figured out what
Colonel Carter did to trigger the device.

27:03.780 --> 27:06.510
I had to run a reverse scan
on all the energy fluctuations

27:06.620 --> 27:09.750
that we've been recording, put them
through a program designed to...

27:09.860 --> 27:12.830
Anyway, I isolated the algorithm she used

27:12.930 --> 27:15.450
to synchronize the energy emissions
coming from the device.

27:15.560 --> 27:17.890
-What?
-Don't you see?

27:18.230 --> 27:22.000
That means if I counteract
Sam's algorithm from my computer,

27:22.100 --> 27:25.700
allow the emissions to return
to their normal frequencies,

27:26.610 --> 27:29.100
that could well reverse the process.

27:30.940 --> 27:33.850
Oh, just give me a second. This is brilliant.

27:40.890 --> 27:42.250
That should do it.

27:53.370 --> 27:55.200
-Sam.
-Daniel.

27:56.600 --> 27:58.940
Bill, I will never doubt you again.

28:04.780 --> 28:06.040
Oh, boy.

28:10.150 --> 28:12.450
Dr. Jackson, can you hear me?

28:17.160 --> 28:20.130
If you can, press this button for "yes."

28:35.340 --> 28:37.810
Teal'c. You all right?

28:38.980 --> 28:40.670
It is a light wound.

28:42.950 --> 28:44.110
Lieutenant.

28:45.650 --> 28:46.880
What happened?

28:47.850 --> 28:52.480
-I found Volnek.
-Then you're lucky to be alive.

28:54.730 --> 28:55.960
Haikon.

28:58.370 --> 29:00.930
Others were not so fortunate.

29:01.030 --> 29:02.900
HADDEN: He woke up a few minutes ago.

29:04.270 --> 29:06.070
What has happened to Volnek?

29:07.310 --> 29:11.510
Ten days ago
he went to a neighboring world

29:12.250 --> 29:15.080
to acquire supplies for our village.

29:17.480 --> 29:22.110
HAIKON: On the way back to the Chappa 'ai,
he encountered a Prior.

29:23.060 --> 29:24.790
He was told that the Sodan

29:24.890 --> 29:29.230
had committed unforgivable treason
against the Ori.

29:30.260 --> 29:34.130
The Prior vowed
that great ill would befall us

29:34.400 --> 29:37.730
and then planted his staff into the ground.

29:39.670 --> 29:44.370
Volnek returned to the village
and told me of the encounter.

29:44.940 --> 29:49.780
We took the threat seriously,
keeping a watchful eye on the Chappa 'ai.

29:53.250 --> 29:57.780
Several days passed without incident until

30:00.490 --> 30:02.120
Volnek fell ill.

30:03.900 --> 30:07.230
He became irrational, incoherent.

30:07.900 --> 30:11.960
We isolated him and treated him
with our best medicines,

30:12.840 --> 30:14.900
but his condition worsened.

30:15.040 --> 30:16.200
(SCREAMING)

30:25.750 --> 30:30.780
Y esterday, he broke the bonds
that were meant to restrain him.

30:32.490 --> 30:35.290
Our finest warriors
attempted to subdue him,

30:35.800 --> 30:38.820
but he killed them all
with very little effort.

30:39.470 --> 30:42.300
He then turned on everyone in his sight.

30:43.940 --> 30:48.070
His own brother, Jolan,
was killed in the carnage that followed.

30:49.310 --> 30:51.500
Women and children fled to the woods

30:51.810 --> 30:55.250
and Volnek followed them
and slaughtered them all

30:56.020 --> 30:57.480
without mercy.

30:58.650 --> 31:03.090
To the best of my knowledge,
I am the only one to have survived.

31:06.060 --> 31:08.530
Rest, brother. Rest.

31:10.330 --> 31:12.800
REYNOLDS: SG-22 establish
defensive perimeter.

31:14.500 --> 31:16.370
SG-3 stay close to me.

31:24.110 --> 31:25.300
Colonel Reynolds.

31:25.410 --> 31:28.610
Teal'c, what the hell happened here?
Why haven't you checked in?

31:28.720 --> 31:32.650
-The Eye of the Gods has been damaged.
-We're trapped here and so are you.

31:32.750 --> 31:35.190
The Ori had a hand
in what has transpired here.

31:35.290 --> 31:37.690
-The Ori?
-We have much to discuss.

31:38.660 --> 31:39.720
Come.

31:54.640 --> 31:57.440
LEE: Okay, ifyou're still there,
I've given it some thought,

31:57.540 --> 32:01.240
and my guess is it should be
a simple matter of reversing the process.

32:01.350 --> 32:02.510
I'm on it.

32:04.750 --> 32:06.840
Is that supposed to be reassuring?

32:10.120 --> 32:11.450
Where's Mitchell?

32:11.860 --> 32:13.660
He went offworld
with the extraction team.

32:13.760 --> 32:14.920
What?

32:15.030 --> 32:18.560
He was convinced he could help Teal'c.
I couldn't talk him out of it.

32:18.670 --> 32:20.530
Why doesn't that surprise me?

32:20.730 --> 32:22.890
There's no sense in worrying
about that now.

32:23.000 --> 32:27.230
On the bright side, the translation
will go a lot quicker now that you're here.

32:35.820 --> 32:40.410
Okay, this is interesting.
It appears to be a log of some kind.

32:42.690 --> 32:46.020
Merlin was conducting research
on some kind of new invention.

32:51.130 --> 32:52.830
And it was something big.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.530
He went to great lengths to try and hide it.

32:58.540 --> 33:02.770
This device was invented for the sole
purpose of keeping his research a secret.

33:02.910 --> 33:05.140
He needed a way to conceal it from...

33:06.080 --> 33:07.440
(ELECTRONIC HUMMING)

33:07.550 --> 33:08.710
Daniel?

33:10.050 --> 33:12.850
Merlin needed
to conceal his research from...

33:12.950 --> 33:15.010
His fellow ascended beings.

33:16.520 --> 33:18.790
But if he was ascended

33:18.890 --> 33:21.990
he must have retaken human form
to perform his research.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.990
I don't get it. What invention
could've been so important

33:25.100 --> 33:27.970
that it would have led him
to give up his Ascension?

33:28.130 --> 33:29.230
A weapon.

33:30.670 --> 33:33.800
A weapon capable
of destroying Ascended beings.

33:41.080 --> 33:44.210
You hit him with two P-90s,
and he didn't die? How is that possible?

33:44.320 --> 33:46.840
We have encountered
something like this before,

33:46.950 --> 33:49.890
an Ancient device capable
of reanimating dead tissue.

33:50.520 --> 33:53.580
Anubis used a similar technology
to give life to his Kull warriors.

33:53.690 --> 33:55.460
I'm assuming there's no cure.

33:55.560 --> 34:00.290
-The Volnek we know is dead.
-So how do we stop him, it, whatever?

34:00.770 --> 34:02.790
By destroying the body entirely.

34:04.770 --> 34:07.430
-Claymores.
-Oh, that's what I'm talking about.

34:07.810 --> 34:09.500
We just plant two of them
opposite each other

34:09.610 --> 34:11.440
and run a trip wire
right through the middle.

34:11.540 --> 34:13.710
Then all we gotta do is lure him in.

34:14.380 --> 34:15.750
Piece of cake.

34:16.020 --> 34:19.580
While we're at it, maybe we could
teach him how to speak Japanese.

34:20.420 --> 34:22.410
-I will do it.
-What?

34:23.060 --> 34:25.020
Teal'c, the kill zone is gonna be huge.

34:25.120 --> 34:27.350
You're gonna have to be awful quick
to get out of it.

34:27.460 --> 34:28.520
Understood.

34:28.630 --> 34:30.620
No, no. Now that's just crazy.

34:30.730 --> 34:32.960
Let's at least wait for reinforcements.

34:33.070 --> 34:35.530
Waiting will only put the lives of others
at risk.

34:35.640 --> 34:38.540
Volnek was clever enough
to disable the Eye of the Gods.

34:38.640 --> 34:41.510
Undoubtedly, the missing crystal
is in his possession.

34:41.610 --> 34:44.100
The only way we can return
to Earth is to retrieve it

34:44.210 --> 34:47.540
and the only way that we can do that
is by killing Volnek.

34:49.380 --> 34:50.910
There is no other way.

34:59.260 --> 35:01.890
Merlin believed that the Ori
represented a significant threat

35:02.000 --> 35:05.190
to the safety of this galaxy,
including the Ancients themselves,

35:05.300 --> 35:08.790
who refused to take any action
to protect themselves against them.

35:08.900 --> 35:10.770
So he went ahead
and developed the weapon anyway.

35:10.870 --> 35:13.130
Well, he found a way of doing it
without their knowing about it

35:13.240 --> 35:15.800
by shifting his research
to another dimension.

35:15.910 --> 35:18.400
So, the weapon, did he ever complete it?

35:21.210 --> 35:22.840
See, this is all technical.
Way over my head.

35:22.950 --> 35:24.780
I wish you understood Ancient.

35:24.880 --> 35:27.650
These notes seem to indicate that
he completed the weapon here on Earth

35:27.750 --> 35:30.310
and then had to relocate it to...

35:37.060 --> 35:40.160
I don't need to know Ancient
to understand what that is.

35:40.300 --> 35:42.730
A gate address
to where he hid the weapon.

35:56.680 --> 35:58.150
Claymores are ready.

36:00.120 --> 36:04.520
You and your men establish a perimeter.
I will lead Volnek into the trap.

36:05.760 --> 36:09.060
-You sure you wanna do this?
-I am.

36:18.870 --> 36:19.930
Okay.

36:22.810 --> 36:25.710
I'm going to try
to make an adjustment to the algorithm.

36:25.810 --> 36:29.580
It's a bit of a long shot,
but if I can get this to sync-up...

36:33.220 --> 36:34.620
BOTH: Uh-oh.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.120
Oh, no.

36:42.130 --> 36:43.430
(CLEARS THROAT)

36:45.630 --> 36:47.030
Hello, this is Dr. Lee.

36:47.130 --> 36:50.470
I'd like to speak
with General Landry, please.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.500
Yeah, it's a bit of an emergency.

36:56.540 --> 37:00.840
You know, there's a fine line between
crazy-brave and crazy-crazy, my friend.

37:00.950 --> 37:02.540
And you are walking it.

37:03.420 --> 37:06.110
You realize he took out
an entire Sodan village?

37:16.300 --> 37:19.860
You know, the last thing I need
is for you to get yourself killed.

37:20.070 --> 37:22.860
You realize how long it will take me
to find a replacement?

37:22.970 --> 37:25.400
You worry far too much, Colonel Mitchell.

37:27.470 --> 37:30.470
-You can hear me now?
-And see you.

37:33.010 --> 37:34.000
You're not surprised?

37:34.110 --> 37:37.110
What is it? What's going on?

37:37.480 --> 37:40.580
I'm not sure, but I may have accidentally

37:40.920 --> 37:44.190
drained a significant portion
of the machine's power supply.

37:44.320 --> 37:45.590
How significant?

37:45.690 --> 37:49.890
According to these readings, it could
reach critical failure inside 15 minutes.

37:50.500 --> 37:53.430
And what happens to Carter,
Mitchell and Daniel?

37:54.770 --> 37:57.530
In all likelihood,
we'll be permanently stranded.

37:59.510 --> 38:01.060
So we can see each other
when you're cloaked,

38:01.170 --> 38:03.700
that means if Volnek's cloaked
he'll be able to see me.

38:03.810 --> 38:06.800
All I've gotta do is get his attention
and lead him right back to Reynolds.

38:06.910 --> 38:09.850
I do not feel comfortable allowing you
to shoulder all the risk.

38:09.950 --> 38:12.420
Ain't no risk. I'm out of phase, remember?

38:14.220 --> 38:16.780
And you are certain
you will not be injured?

38:17.290 --> 38:20.280
Absolutely.
Hey, take your best shot if you don't...

38:24.230 --> 38:26.030
Good luck, Colonel Mitchell.

38:27.900 --> 38:30.840
-Did you even think twice about that?
-I did not.

38:37.610 --> 38:38.770
Volnek!

38:40.280 --> 38:41.640
Hey, Volnek!

38:47.250 --> 38:48.410
Volnek!

38:49.620 --> 38:51.350
Where are you, homeboy?

38:51.460 --> 38:54.650
Come on out and show me
some of those monster moves!

38:56.330 --> 38:57.730
(SNARLING)

38:57.830 --> 39:00.530
Oh, there you are. I was getting worried.

39:00.700 --> 39:02.000
(GROWLING)

39:08.170 --> 39:10.570
Sorry. You gotta do better than that.

39:14.950 --> 39:16.680
Come on, big fella!

39:26.960 --> 39:28.620
(LASER BEAMS FIRING)

39:44.080 --> 39:46.410
There you go. Come on and get you some.

39:54.620 --> 39:56.140
(SNARLING)

39:58.320 --> 40:00.260
-We're running out of time.
-Okay, I think I've got it.

40:00.360 --> 40:02.830
This is some kind
of master control screen.

40:03.660 --> 40:06.560
Yeah, here it is. It's a button combination.

40:09.070 --> 40:13.300
-lf this works, what happens to Mitchell?
-I don't know.

40:13.410 --> 40:17.810
It's possible there's still a subspace
connection linking him to the device.

40:19.550 --> 40:21.040
And if there isn't?

40:25.920 --> 40:27.890
LANDRY: Doctor.
LEE: Okay.

40:28.650 --> 40:30.550
I'm gonna try and make
an adjustment to the algorithm.

40:30.660 --> 40:31.650
It's a bit of a long shot...

40:31.760 --> 40:34.890
You'd better be sure about this, Doctor,
because if you make me disappear,

40:34.990 --> 40:37.830
there won't be a dimension
safe enough for you.

40:53.050 --> 40:56.640
Come on, don't give up!
Come on, come on!

40:56.850 --> 40:57.980
(SNARLING)

41:08.190 --> 41:09.420
Oh, crap.

41:13.470 --> 41:14.870
You did it.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.210
No, actually, I didn't.

41:21.770 --> 41:23.940
It was Daniel. He figured it out.

41:25.850 --> 41:27.540
Where's Colonel Mitchell?

41:27.950 --> 41:29.310
-Oh...
-Oh...

41:33.920 --> 41:35.050
(GROANING)

41:35.520 --> 41:36.680
(ROARING)

42:27.810 --> 42:30.280
You know, the whole point
of my coming here

42:30.440 --> 42:32.310
was for me to rescue you.

42:33.880 --> 42:35.570
You are most welcome, Colonel Mitchell.

42:37.880 --> 42:40.010
Let's see him get up from that one.

42:40.920 --> 42:43.510
Unfortunately, we must now
locate the crystal.

42:43.960 --> 42:45.820
What, are you talking about this crystal?

42:45.930 --> 42:47.550
I took it off him during the fight.

42:47.660 --> 42:50.930
You know, if we hurry
we'll make it in time for dinner.
