00:01.927 --> 00:05.292
Seven stone giants
standing guard

00:05.294 --> 00:07.299
over a Pacific island.

00:07.321 --> 00:10.905
But what are they protecting,
and from whom?

00:10.907 --> 00:12.845
According to
the people of the island,

00:12.921 --> 00:17.372
they face the actual homeland
of their ancestors.

00:17.461 --> 00:21.832
Could the answer be
found some 2,000 miles away?

00:21.987 --> 00:24.605
We are baffled
by what it's all about.

00:24.681 --> 00:26.425
Ancient astronaut theorists,

00:26.427 --> 00:29.225
Giorgio Tsoukalos
and David Childress

00:29.381 --> 00:31.652
embark on an
incredible journey...

00:31.807 --> 00:32.927
This is the famous Hiva.

00:33.054 --> 00:35.552
...to a land
of bizarre figures...

00:35.707 --> 00:39.899
Look at all these heads with
the big goggle-shaped eyes.

00:40.054 --> 00:42.072
...and forbidden places...

00:42.074 --> 00:44.045
If you step on the site,

00:44.047 --> 00:46.945
something bad is going
to happen to you.

00:47.101 --> 00:48.872
...in search of what could be

00:48.874 --> 00:52.179
the ultimate evidence
of mankind's

00:52.201 --> 00:54.412
extraterrestrial origins.

00:54.421 --> 00:56.879
If we can crack the
mysteries of Easter Island,

00:57.034 --> 00:59.019
we're going to be able to open
up once and for all

00:59.041 --> 01:00.770
the true mysteries
of the ancient world.

01:30.201 --> 01:32.492
Easter Sunday,

01:32.501 --> 01:35.525
April 5, 1722.

01:35.681 --> 01:38.912
Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen

01:38.921 --> 01:42.605
is 2,300 miles off the coast
of Chile,

01:42.661 --> 01:46.339
leading a fleet of three ships
on an expedition to establish

01:46.494 --> 01:49.419
a western trade route
to the Spice Islands.

01:49.594 --> 01:53.412
In the early afternoon,
he is alerted by his crew

01:53.521 --> 01:56.332
that they have spotted
a small island,

01:56.507 --> 02:00.239
and that there is smoke rising
from it in several places,

02:00.261 --> 02:02.925
suggesting that it is inhabited.

02:02.981 --> 02:06.192
When they reach the shore,
they are surprised

02:06.281 --> 02:08.538
by the appearance
of some of the natives.

02:08.693 --> 02:10.764
When Roggeveen and his crew

02:10.920 --> 02:13.839
discovered Easter Island
in 1722,

02:13.994 --> 02:16.832
accounts were written down

02:16.834 --> 02:19.079
that not only
did they stumble across

02:19.234 --> 02:22.399
normal Polynesian-looking
people, but as well,

02:22.554 --> 02:24.892
people of giant proportions,

02:24.894 --> 02:27.032
who were light skinned,
had red hair,

02:27.187 --> 02:28.792
and even blonde hair.

02:28.947 --> 02:31.832
As recorded in the ship's log,

02:31.834 --> 02:36.019
they also made another,
even more unexpected discovery.

02:36.174 --> 02:38.352
"We noticed certain

02:38.354 --> 02:41.059
"remarkably tall stone figures.

02:41.214 --> 02:45.245
"These stone figures caused us
to be filled with wonder,

02:45.321 --> 02:49.399
"for we could not understand how
it was possible to erect them.

02:49.554 --> 02:52.885
"Some of these statues were
a good 30 feet in height

02:53.041 --> 02:54.859
and broad in proportion."

02:58.327 --> 03:02.019
Roggeveen named this
remote land "Easter Island,"

03:02.041 --> 03:04.485
after the day on which
it was discovered.

03:04.541 --> 03:08.792
But today,
nearly 300 years later,

03:08.881 --> 03:11.992
Roggeveen's questions concerning
the strange appearance

03:12.101 --> 03:15.292
of the natives, as well as
the origins and purpose

03:15.381 --> 03:18.712
of the gigantic stone statues,
known as moai,

03:18.867 --> 03:20.992
have yet to be answered.

03:21.147 --> 03:23.852
One can imagine that the moai,

03:24.007 --> 03:26.197
being set up all around
the island with their backs

03:26.221 --> 03:28.037
to the outside world
looking inwards,

03:28.061 --> 03:31.852
were a kind
of protective barrier

03:31.854 --> 03:33.812
that the ancestors
would look after them,

03:33.814 --> 03:35.992
and protect their little world.

03:36.001 --> 03:38.072
The thing about these moai

03:38.227 --> 03:42.012
is that they have these very
strange faces, very elongated.

03:42.014 --> 03:43.592
They don't look quite human.

03:43.594 --> 03:45.339
They're humanoid,

03:45.494 --> 03:47.899
but they're somehow different
than ordinary humans.

03:47.921 --> 03:51.379
They look almost alien
in appearance.

03:51.534 --> 03:54.552
And you have to wonder, what do
they ultimately represent?

03:54.727 --> 03:56.992
Carved from volcanic rock,

03:57.101 --> 04:01.405
the nearly 900 moai each weigh
up to 90 tons,

04:01.581 --> 04:04.325
and the tallest of them tower
above the landscape

04:04.501 --> 04:07.905
at heights of more than 30 feet.

04:07.907 --> 04:11.092
There have been many theories
over the years

04:11.267 --> 04:13.592
as to how they were moved.

04:13.767 --> 04:16.612
The first theory is thought

04:16.767 --> 04:19.139
that they must have been
dragged horizontally

04:19.161 --> 04:23.132
on sledges or rollers
or something of that kind.

04:23.134 --> 04:26.159
It was tried again recently
for a TV film,

04:26.334 --> 04:28.132
and again they moved it
a few meters

04:28.134 --> 04:31.179
but it really doesn't, uh,
prove anything.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.712
The idea

04:32.867 --> 04:35.339
that the trees were cut down
at some point,

04:35.494 --> 04:40.159
and they were all used
for rollers, wooden logs,

04:40.181 --> 04:43.352
falls by the wayside,
because wooden rollers

04:43.507 --> 04:45.539
would not be able to support

04:45.694 --> 04:48.999
the weight of some
of these statues.

04:49.021 --> 04:52.205
You're talking about
several hundred statues,

04:52.207 --> 04:55.285
and it would depend on the size
and weight of the statue,

04:55.287 --> 04:57.852
the number of people you had
available to help,

04:58.007 --> 05:01.105
the distance you were going
to go, the kind of terrain.

05:01.161 --> 05:04.612
So, basically,
we don't really know.

05:04.767 --> 05:08.839
For ancient astronaut theorists,

05:09.014 --> 05:11.825
the answers to just how
the moai were transported

05:11.981 --> 05:14.099
and positioned in the island

05:14.121 --> 05:17.665
can be found in the legends told
by the native people,

05:17.821 --> 05:20.945
legends that suggested
a type of energy,

05:21.021 --> 05:24.345
known as "mana,"
was used to literally levitate

05:24.347 --> 05:28.365
the giant sculptures into place.

05:28.367 --> 05:32.059
According with, uh, oral
tradition and the legends...

05:41.307 --> 05:43.765
The king was given
the gift of mana

05:43.821 --> 05:47.112
from the great creator god,
Makemake.

05:47.267 --> 05:50.105
Legend holds
that the king commanded

05:50.261 --> 05:52.959
that these
great stone statues walk.

05:56.181 --> 05:58.845
And one has to wonder,

05:58.847 --> 06:01.192
well, either they all

06:01.347 --> 06:04.445
were off their rockers
describing these things,

06:04.521 --> 06:07.005
or they witnessed something.

06:07.181 --> 06:09.181
And I'm leaning more
in the direction

06:09.307 --> 06:11.172
that they witnessed something

06:11.347 --> 06:15.872
because there had to have been
a spark of inspiration.

06:15.874 --> 06:17.932
And so, in my opinion,

06:17.934 --> 06:21.959
mana was some type of
extraterrestrial technology

06:21.981 --> 06:25.232
that allowed these stones

06:25.321 --> 06:28.732
to be levitated into place.

06:28.887 --> 06:31.719
When the statues had pupils,

06:31.874 --> 06:34.579
they came to life,

06:34.581 --> 06:38.232
imbued with mana to have
supernatural powers.

06:38.234 --> 06:41.265
According to
the Easter Island myth,

06:41.267 --> 06:45.759
this power came out of the eyes
of the statues,

06:45.761 --> 06:48.505
and was this mystical power.

06:48.661 --> 06:50.859
It's like it was creating
some kind

06:50.901 --> 06:53.919
of force field of energy

06:53.941 --> 06:57.699
that surrounded the island
and protected it.

06:57.854 --> 07:00.925
So you have to wonder if there's
something real here,

07:00.981 --> 07:05.339
and was it some kind of
extraterrestrial technology?

07:05.341 --> 07:09.652
Of all the many
mysteries of Easter Island,

07:09.741 --> 07:11.939
perhaps the most puzzling
involves

07:12.094 --> 07:13.977
not only the construction
of the moai,

07:14.001 --> 07:16.825
but their positioning
on the island.

07:17.001 --> 07:23.705
880 of the 887 moai face inland,

07:23.861 --> 07:26.352
but on the west edge
of the island,

07:26.354 --> 07:28.965
seven of the moai
are positioned on a platform

07:29.141 --> 07:31.272
known as Ahu Akivi,

07:31.274 --> 07:34.619
and face outwardly,
towards the sea.

07:34.641 --> 07:36.912
Moais face in, it's believed,

07:36.914 --> 07:39.479
because they're protecting
the village that they oversee.

07:39.634 --> 07:44.519
Ahu Akivi is the one exception.

07:44.521 --> 07:48.272
The moais there look out to sea.

07:48.427 --> 07:53.425
Not only that,
they're identical.

07:53.427 --> 07:57.525
But why would these
seven identical moai face out

07:57.527 --> 08:01.799
to sea, when all of the other
moai on the island face inland?

08:01.954 --> 08:06.472
Could it be that they were meant
to point to a specific location

08:06.627 --> 08:09.052
somewhere farther out?

08:09.141 --> 08:12.925
Perhaps the answer can be found
by drawing a straight line

08:12.927 --> 08:16.632
from the line of sight
of the seven moai.

08:16.787 --> 08:20.279
Following it on
a northwesterly route,

08:20.434 --> 08:24.399
the first landmass in its path
is the Marquesas Islands,

08:24.554 --> 08:28.232
roughly 2,300 miles
from Easter Island.

08:28.387 --> 08:31.105
The Marquesas are an
extremely remote island group,

08:31.161 --> 08:33.452
which is part of
French Polynesia.

08:33.626 --> 08:37.645
It's a three-and-a-half-hour
flight northeast of Tahiti.

08:37.647 --> 08:41.179
And it's a part of what's known
as the Polynesian triangle,

08:41.354 --> 08:44.279
which is bound by Hawaii
in the north,

08:44.280 --> 08:46.245
Easter Island in the east,

08:46.401 --> 08:50.465
and New Zealand in the west.

08:50.467 --> 08:55.685
It was the last place on Earth
that was discovered.

08:55.841 --> 08:57.990
And there's probably more
mystery shrouded in the Pacific

08:58.014 --> 08:59.577
than any other place
in the world.

08:59.601 --> 09:02.932
To follow up on
the incredible theory

09:03.021 --> 09:05.505
that Easter Island's origins
might be found

09:05.561 --> 09:07.859
on one of the remote
Marquesas Islands,

09:08.014 --> 09:12.339
in June, 2018,
ancient astronaut theorists

09:12.361 --> 09:15.659
Giorgio Tsoukalos
and David Childress

09:15.661 --> 09:18.679
set out to explore the islands
for themselves.

09:18.701 --> 09:20.557
This is gonna be a great
exploration

09:20.581 --> 09:22.359
to see what connection there is

09:22.361 --> 09:24.712
between Easter Island
and right here.

09:24.721 --> 09:25.961
Should be quite the adventure.

09:35.587 --> 09:36.799
- Hello.
- Hello.

09:36.974 --> 09:38.770
I'm Giorgio.
Pleasure to meet you.

09:38.794 --> 09:41.892
- I'm Aniata.
- Hi, I'm David.

09:42.047 --> 09:44.479
Arriving on one of
the Marquesas Islands,

09:44.634 --> 09:47.719
ancient astronaut theorists
Giorgio Tsoukalos

09:47.741 --> 09:49.779
and David Childress meet

09:49.934 --> 09:52.459
with local guide
Aniata Kimitete.

09:52.634 --> 09:53.805
Let's go explore.

09:53.807 --> 09:55.879
- Great.
- All right.

09:55.921 --> 10:00.632
She has brought them
to an area known as Kamuihei,

10:00.634 --> 10:03.252
a sacred place believed
to be rich

10:03.261 --> 10:07.385
in what the natives call "mana"
or spiritual power.

10:07.387 --> 10:11.519
Here, they hope to find
the answer as to why seven

10:11.561 --> 10:15.205
of the nearly 900 giant statues
on Easter Island

10:15.361 --> 10:18.679
are all facing in the direction
of this remote island chain

10:18.681 --> 10:20.639
in the South Pacific.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.712
So we are arriving

10:24.714 --> 10:26.539
at this spot
where I really wanted

10:26.561 --> 10:27.761
to show you about this site.

10:27.854 --> 10:28.854
Oh, look at this.

10:31.141 --> 10:33.812
What we see here
is what we call petroglyphs.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.119
Yeah.

10:35.274 --> 10:38.099
So you have three turtles.

10:38.121 --> 10:41.872
So one, two, three here.

10:41.961 --> 10:46.345
And also, on the rock,
you can see a canoe.

10:46.501 --> 10:48.341
- Okay.
- So you have the head

10:48.481 --> 10:51.699
of the canoe here that looks
a little bit like a bird.

10:51.721 --> 10:54.059
Their canoes had
a bird head at the front.

10:54.234 --> 10:56.205
Do you see the beak?

10:56.361 --> 10:58.612
- Yeah, that looks like a bird head.
- Yeah.

10:58.767 --> 11:00.979
And what is the
significance of the turtles?

11:01.134 --> 11:06.379
The turtle is actually
the messenger from the gods.

11:06.534 --> 11:09.259
He was a very sacred animal.

11:09.261 --> 11:11.030
People were not allowed
to eat them.

11:11.054 --> 11:12.439
You know, I think

11:12.614 --> 11:14.343
this is really interested
what you said,

11:14.367 --> 11:16.025
that the turtle is regarded here

11:16.201 --> 11:18.199
as a messenger of the gods,

11:18.354 --> 11:20.090
because this is not
something new.

11:20.114 --> 11:23.185
It's not something native
to this area.

11:23.187 --> 11:25.325
There are other parts
of the world

11:25.327 --> 11:26.945
where the turtle is described

11:27.101 --> 11:29.565
by having descended
from the sky.

11:29.567 --> 11:33.399
And the idea that this is here,
too, considered

11:33.401 --> 11:36.732
a messenger of the gods,
that, to me, is a connection

11:36.734 --> 11:39.339
to potential extraterrestrials.

11:39.514 --> 11:41.399
Throughout the world,

11:41.554 --> 11:45.032
numerous ancient cultures
have origin stories

11:45.034 --> 11:49.012
that involve some sort of
a divine or "cosmic" turtle.

11:49.101 --> 11:53.472
Followers of Japanese Shinto
venerate the Kame-ishi,

11:53.581 --> 11:57.952
a stone turtle that portends
the end of the world.

11:57.961 --> 12:02.379
In Guatemala, there are legends
of giant flying turtles,

12:02.534 --> 12:06.245
and even artifacts that feature
the image of a man wearing

12:06.401 --> 12:11.072
what appears to be a helmet
lying inside a turtle shell.

12:11.247 --> 12:14.999
In North America,
the Iroquois Indians tell tales

12:15.174 --> 12:17.339
of a "sky goddess"

12:17.494 --> 12:19.132
who falls to Earth from the sky,

12:19.287 --> 12:21.499
whereupon a giant turtle
rises up

12:21.521 --> 12:23.519
from the ocean to catch her.

12:25.361 --> 12:27.552
I think it's interesting here,

12:27.554 --> 12:30.065
this canoe, which would have
been very large,

12:30.221 --> 12:32.165
has the bird head on it.

12:32.167 --> 12:33.985
And you have the Birdmen

12:33.987 --> 12:35.987
of Easter Island
that are so famous.

12:38.607 --> 12:42.119
One of Easter Island's
ancient traditions involves

12:42.121 --> 12:45.239
Tangata manu,
or the Birdman cult.

12:45.414 --> 12:49.719
According to legend,
the creator god, Makemake,

12:49.874 --> 12:53.912
was looking in a mirror and saw
a bird land on his shoulder.

12:54.067 --> 12:56.552
Seeing his image combined
with the bird,

12:56.561 --> 13:01.012
he decided to make a son
who was half man, half bird.

13:01.021 --> 13:04.692
In turn, the Rapa Nui people
of Easter Island worshipped

13:04.694 --> 13:09.139
the Birdman as the predecessor
of all humans.

13:10.781 --> 13:14.345
One of the central focuses
of the rituals,

13:14.501 --> 13:17.385
the annual rituals
at Easter Island,

13:17.441 --> 13:22.892
was that of Tangata manu,
the Birdman.

13:23.067 --> 13:26.519
And the Birdman is
a universal symbol

13:26.674 --> 13:29.299
that we find in many parts
of the globe

13:29.341 --> 13:34.039
that relates to ancestry
associated with figures,

13:34.214 --> 13:37.412
characters in feather coats
who were seen

13:37.567 --> 13:41.979
to be able to go between
this world and the next.

13:42.134 --> 13:46.532
And here we have the same ideas
on Easter Island.

13:46.687 --> 13:49.052
Is there more to see
on the island?

13:49.207 --> 13:51.639
We have a lot more
to see on the island.

13:51.794 --> 13:53.779
- Okay.
- So let's go.  - Okay.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.812
After showing Giorgio and David

13:56.967 --> 14:00.039
the ancient petroglyphs,
Aniata takes them to a site

14:00.194 --> 14:02.512
that has some of the most
striking statuary

14:02.514 --> 14:04.805
in the Marquesas.

14:04.961 --> 14:07.412
Right now,
we are at the Tohua of Temehea.

14:07.421 --> 14:10.385
So, the <i> tohua</i>
is the gathering place.

14:10.387 --> 14:14.419
And so this sculpture here
is a modern sculpture.

14:14.421 --> 14:17.632
But is this based
on something old?

14:17.641 --> 14:21.572
Yes. Because the site
that we're on was rebuilt.

14:21.574 --> 14:23.025
Even though it's modern,

14:23.201 --> 14:25.379
it's really based
on the original statue.

14:25.554 --> 14:27.005
Oh, wow. Okay.

14:27.181 --> 14:29.092
Is this considered a tiki?

14:29.094 --> 14:32.799
Yes, these tikis represent
the population.

14:32.801 --> 14:34.579
So, to the Marquesan people,

14:34.734 --> 14:36.432
wh-what is a tiki?

14:36.587 --> 14:40.052
A tiki, at first, was
the representation of our god

14:40.227 --> 14:42.312
of magic and sorcery.

14:42.401 --> 14:46.325
He was one of the only god
in French Polynesia that has

14:46.481 --> 14:47.481
the face of a man.

14:49.201 --> 14:52.172
He became our protector,

14:52.174 --> 14:54.119
because when you have a tiki

14:54.294 --> 14:56.759
by your side, then you're
protected from your enemy.

14:56.914 --> 14:59.065
In the Marquesas,

14:59.067 --> 15:01.639
the word "tiki"
can be used to refer

15:01.794 --> 15:04.159
both to an ancestral figure
that came to the islands

15:04.314 --> 15:05.759
in ancient times

15:05.914 --> 15:09.212
as well as the statues
that represent him.

15:09.367 --> 15:12.992
They are variously carved
in both wood and stone

15:12.994 --> 15:18.085
and often depict a being
with large, goggle-like eyes.

15:18.087 --> 15:22.312
The lore has it that
Tiki was the primary ancestor

15:22.401 --> 15:25.285
and was created in the image
of the sky god.

15:25.441 --> 15:28.785
The local people made statues
in honor of their creator god,

15:28.941 --> 15:31.159
Tiki, and used them in worship.

15:33.014 --> 15:35.572
And this is
what Tiki looks like,

15:35.574 --> 15:38.165
- as a god?
- Yes, because th-they say

15:38.167 --> 15:40.745
in the legend that,
when Tiki left

15:40.747 --> 15:42.772
the Earth,
they made the sculpture

15:42.927 --> 15:44.699
of how he looked like,

15:44.701 --> 15:48.012
just to have something
to remember from Tiki.

15:48.021 --> 15:50.605
So that's how he looked like,
actually.

15:50.607 --> 15:52.005
He looks very strange to me.

15:52.061 --> 15:54.319
This is a representation

15:54.474 --> 15:57.445
of what your ancestors thought

15:57.447 --> 15:59.932
this figure looked like.

16:00.087 --> 16:01.552
It doesn't look like a man.

16:01.727 --> 16:03.839
It looks... weird.

16:03.861 --> 16:06.061
Yeah, I mean,
he-he sort of looks like a man,

16:06.194 --> 16:08.805
but, with these big goggle eyes

16:08.961 --> 16:11.425
and the elongated head
and everything,

16:11.601 --> 16:14.879
he looks
like an extraterrestrial.

16:15.961 --> 16:17.632
From what you know,

16:17.787 --> 16:20.819
do you think
that the people of the Marquesas

16:20.974 --> 16:23.279
went as far as Easter Island?

16:23.301 --> 16:24.439
Are there any legends or stories

16:24.461 --> 16:26.023
- behind that?
- So, there is

16:26.047 --> 16:28.612
one story where...
when they said, um,

16:28.767 --> 16:32.779
that one chief of the island
sent his seven sons

16:32.934 --> 16:34.572
to Easter Island,

16:34.574 --> 16:37.712
because they were fighting a lot
over here.

16:37.714 --> 16:39.092
So he sent them away.

16:39.247 --> 16:41.599
Told them, uh,
if they wanted to come back,

16:41.601 --> 16:43.681
they had to make peace
with one another.

16:44.647 --> 16:46.772
Seven brothers?

16:46.927 --> 16:50.605
Princes who left the Marquesas
Islands for Easter Island

16:50.761 --> 16:53.112
hundreds of years ago?

16:53.267 --> 16:55.259
I think it's really fascinating

16:55.281 --> 16:58.759
that, in the Marquesas, there's
a story of seven brothers

16:58.801 --> 17:01.139
that were exiled by their father

17:01.161 --> 17:03.039
in order to go to Easter Island.

17:03.214 --> 17:07.638
You combine that with the fact
that there is this platform

17:07.794 --> 17:13.071
on Easter Island with
seven moais standing on there,

17:13.074 --> 17:16.172
that would indicate to me
that the Marquesas

17:16.261 --> 17:19.819
and Easter Island
are, in fact, connected.

17:22.914 --> 17:26.372
But if the stone
carvings and ancient legends

17:26.527 --> 17:29.039
prove that the origins
of Easter Island

17:29.081 --> 17:32.719
can be found some 2,000 miles
away in the Marquesas,

17:32.874 --> 17:34.959
could there have been another,

17:35.114 --> 17:38.399
perhaps extraterrestrial,
reason for the exile

17:38.401 --> 17:41.692
of the seven royal brothers
from their homeland?

17:41.801 --> 17:45.099
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

17:45.141 --> 17:48.525
and suggest the evidence points
to everything

17:48.701 --> 17:51.652
from the strange faces
of the tiki gods

17:51.654 --> 17:55.339
to bloody stories
of human sacrifice.

18:03.074 --> 18:06.619
Ancient astronaut
theorists Giorgio Tsoukalos

18:06.774 --> 18:10.832
and David Childress are
in the remote Marquesas Islands.

18:10.834 --> 18:14.459
They are searching for clues
that may help them solve

18:14.501 --> 18:16.899
some of the most
compelling mysteries

18:16.901 --> 18:21.179
concerning an island located
some 2,000 miles to their east,

18:21.201 --> 18:24.525
Easter Island.

18:24.681 --> 18:26.099
I think
it's really fascinating that,

18:26.121 --> 18:28.825
of all the standing heads
in Easter Island,

18:28.981 --> 18:31.399
seven of them actually point

18:31.421 --> 18:33.839
in the direction
of the Marquesas.

18:34.014 --> 18:36.572
And so now the question is, why?

18:36.574 --> 18:40.439
I think it's quite possible that
the Marquesas and Easter Island

18:40.594 --> 18:43.012
are, in fact, connected.

18:43.101 --> 18:46.019
But perhaps equally compelling,

18:46.174 --> 18:48.192
if not slightly disturbing,

18:48.201 --> 18:51.212
are numerous carvings
found throughout the islands

18:51.367 --> 18:55.699
which depict strange,
big-eyed gods known as tikis.

18:57.521 --> 19:01.392
So, right now, we are
at the Tohua of Hikokua.

19:01.394 --> 19:03.945
The tiki placed on site
like this,

19:04.101 --> 19:07.039
like, really, uh, sacred site...

19:09.681 --> 19:12.852
...they were made
to scare the people away,

19:12.854 --> 19:14.559
because they-they were telling,

19:14.714 --> 19:17.425
"Hey, this is
a very sacred site,

19:17.581 --> 19:18.939
so be careful."

19:20.134 --> 19:23.052
"If you step on the site,

19:23.207 --> 19:24.945
"if you do something wrong,

19:24.947 --> 19:28.859
then something bad
is going to happen to you."

19:28.861 --> 19:31.159
I think if we are talking
about extraterrestrials

19:31.314 --> 19:32.925
in ancient times visiting

19:32.981 --> 19:35.405
and you follow
the ancient stories,

19:35.407 --> 19:39.092
when they came down
with fire, smoke and noise,

19:39.094 --> 19:41.579
that that is the reason
why they were afraid.

19:41.734 --> 19:43.872
There are
multiple other versions

19:43.881 --> 19:47.752
of the exact same motif
worldwide,

19:47.927 --> 19:51.832
with people with elongated
skulls and giant goggle eyes.

19:51.987 --> 19:55.132
Like, uh, what comes to mind
immediately is in-in Peru.

19:55.141 --> 19:57.317
- Yeah, at Tiwanaku a-and Pumapunku...
- Yes.

19:57.341 --> 19:59.225
...you have the same

19:59.227 --> 20:01.105
goggle-headed, eyed, uh,

20:01.107 --> 20:02.863
- you know, people.
- Exactly.

20:02.887 --> 20:04.070
You have that in Mexico, too,

20:04.094 --> 20:06.545
- with the Olmec statues.
- Yes.

20:06.601 --> 20:10.332
These may be depictions
of actual extraterrestrials

20:10.487 --> 20:13.385
who visited the Earth
thousands of years ago.

20:13.541 --> 20:17.272
Eerily similar
to the tiki of the Marquesas,

20:17.427 --> 20:19.872
figures with oversized skulls

20:20.027 --> 20:23.272
and enormous eyes have surfaced
at archaeological sites

20:23.427 --> 20:24.999
throughout the world.

20:25.154 --> 20:30.252
Among these are
the Dogu figures of Japan,

20:30.261 --> 20:35.072
the aboriginal Wandjina
petroglyphs of Australia,

20:35.247 --> 20:37.652
the terra-cotta figurines

20:37.654 --> 20:40.019
recently unearthed
in Northern Ghana,

20:40.174 --> 20:43.092
the trickster god Eshu

20:43.181 --> 20:46.392
of the Yoruba people of Nigeria,

20:46.481 --> 20:50.019
and the stunning petroglyphs
of Karahunj,

20:50.174 --> 20:54.059
otherwise known
as Armenia's Stonehenge.

20:56.221 --> 20:59.412
So it does seem that Tiki,
he's walking,

20:59.567 --> 21:01.579
he's living and breathing.

21:01.734 --> 21:03.879
He's not just a spirit, is he?

21:04.054 --> 21:06.019
No. He's not a spirit.

21:06.041 --> 21:10.259
So, um, they-they say
that Tiki is not really a god,

21:10.414 --> 21:12.572
but he's not really a man also.

21:12.747 --> 21:16.372
Aniata, thank you so much
for showing us everything here.

21:16.527 --> 21:18.199
- It's truly tremendous.
- You're welcome.

21:18.201 --> 21:19.537
- Thank you so much.
- Have a nice travel.

21:19.561 --> 21:20.672
Thank you.

21:24.681 --> 21:27.019
One day
after their informative visit

21:27.174 --> 21:29.399
to the island of Nuku Hiva,

21:29.554 --> 21:35.105
Giorgio and David travel next
to the nearby island of Hiva Oa

21:35.107 --> 21:38.245
to see firsthand
the most unusual

21:38.401 --> 21:39.579
of all the island tikis.

21:42.761 --> 21:45.279
Hello.

21:45.454 --> 21:46.839
Good to see you.

21:46.881 --> 21:48.059
- Yep.
- Okay.

21:48.081 --> 21:50.492
As their local guide,

21:50.494 --> 21:54.365
they have enlisted
Hiva Oa resident, Heimata Bonno.

21:54.521 --> 21:56.745
This is...

21:56.747 --> 21:58.839
- incredible. So, what are we looking at here?
- Yeah.

21:58.841 --> 22:00.139
What is this?

22:15.274 --> 22:16.677
Oh, it totally looks
like a llama.

22:16.701 --> 22:19.505
No question.

22:19.681 --> 22:21.905
I totally think
this looks like a llama.

22:22.061 --> 22:24.099
I mean, there's no question
in my mind.

22:24.101 --> 22:27.812
And I also don't think
that this was altered.

22:27.987 --> 22:29.645
This is original.

22:29.801 --> 22:32.559
And I don't see any,
uh, changes.

22:32.561 --> 22:35.739
So either this is not authentic

22:35.741 --> 22:38.092
or, if it is authentic,
it's a llama

22:38.094 --> 22:41.179
and it proves connection
to-to South America.

22:42.921 --> 22:44.825
South America?

22:44.981 --> 22:47.292
Is it possible that the llama,

22:47.294 --> 22:49.585
believed to be native
to South America,

22:49.641 --> 22:52.319
was known to people living
on this remote island chain

22:52.494 --> 22:55.412
some 3,500 miles away?

22:55.567 --> 22:57.319
But how?

23:00.394 --> 23:03.079
Some people say
that it's a woman giving birth.

23:03.254 --> 23:05.659
Do the women here

23:05.661 --> 23:07.781
in the Marquesas Islands,
do they do this?

23:07.914 --> 23:11.172
They lie on their stomach
and give birth? No.

23:11.327 --> 23:13.612
This is crazy.

23:13.614 --> 23:15.325
Huh.

23:15.501 --> 23:17.625
To me,

23:17.627 --> 23:20.425
it looks like something
from the sky.

23:20.581 --> 23:24.385
It's like, uh,
maybe some flying vehicle.

23:24.541 --> 23:27.439
- It's a great question.
- Yeah.

23:27.481 --> 23:29.939
Perhaps
what we're looking at here

23:30.114 --> 23:31.972
is some type of a craft,

23:32.061 --> 23:34.181
because you have the windows
in the front,

23:34.314 --> 23:36.279
which are these giant goggles,

23:36.454 --> 23:38.523
and then you have the mouth
in the front,

23:38.547 --> 23:41.859
which, to me, looks
like some type of an air intake.

23:42.014 --> 23:45.425
Underneath,
you have a lifting body

23:45.601 --> 23:48.339
that goes
underneath the entire body.

23:48.361 --> 23:50.825
And if you combine that

23:50.981 --> 23:53.685
with the story of this object

23:53.687 --> 23:55.699
or this woman giving birth,

23:55.854 --> 23:59.705
if someone has never seen
passengers disembarking

23:59.881 --> 24:01.805
from an actual airplane,

24:01.961 --> 24:05.285
if they have no idea
what is happening,

24:05.441 --> 24:08.079
well, all of a sudden,

24:08.254 --> 24:12.472
a flying vehicle
is giving birth to people.

24:12.561 --> 24:15.545
Is it possible
that this ancient statue

24:15.701 --> 24:17.690
that has been interpreted
in modern times

24:17.714 --> 24:19.705
as a fertility goddess

24:19.881 --> 24:24.019
is actually depicting
an extraterrestrial spacecraft?

24:25.441 --> 24:27.885
I think that tikis
are nothing else

24:28.041 --> 24:30.552
but misunderstood technology

24:30.554 --> 24:35.132
that, over time,
turned into divine objects

24:35.134 --> 24:38.259
of magic and sorcery.

24:46.441 --> 24:48.099
Can we go look at it? Great.

24:51.714 --> 24:53.139
Oh, wow.

24:55.647 --> 24:58.519
Clearly, this tiki,
the head is missing.

24:58.674 --> 25:01.939
But I see
that it has six fingers.

25:11.821 --> 25:14.512
It's very feasible to me
that they actually tried

25:14.514 --> 25:17.732
to imitate whoever visited

25:17.734 --> 25:20.759
or whoever came here
to impart this knowledge.

25:20.914 --> 25:23.845
Why would they carve six fingers

25:23.847 --> 25:26.332
if they did not see six fingers?

25:26.487 --> 25:29.919
So we should not say,
"Oh, this is just fantasy."

25:30.094 --> 25:33.779
I think they saw someone
with six fingers.

25:33.934 --> 25:35.505
Is that possible?

25:35.661 --> 25:36.732
Yeah.

25:36.887 --> 25:38.407
- Yes.
- Yeah.

25:47.421 --> 25:49.179
So these are protectors.

25:49.354 --> 25:50.899
And all the tikis here

25:51.074 --> 25:54.779
and the moai on Easter Island
are protectors as well.

25:59.301 --> 26:01.545
So, on Easter Island,
you-you have

26:01.701 --> 26:04.599
seven moai,
and they are looking

26:04.754 --> 26:05.605
towards Marquesas.

26:05.681 --> 26:08.199
Is-is this some ancestors?

26:08.221 --> 26:09.221
Or a connection?

26:16.707 --> 26:19.825
All of the ancient
tikis in the Marquesas

26:20.001 --> 26:22.879
are positioned to look in
the direction of Easter Island.

26:22.881 --> 26:24.612
But why?

26:24.767 --> 26:27.879
And if both the moai
and the tikis are depictions

26:28.034 --> 26:30.299
of extraterrestrial visitors,

26:30.321 --> 26:32.839
why do they appear so different,
both in height

26:32.994 --> 26:35.332
and appearance?

26:35.334 --> 26:38.032
Is it possible that
the seven brothers of legend

26:38.121 --> 26:40.192
left the Marquesas
for Easter Island

26:40.281 --> 26:42.419
because they were fighting
with each other?

26:42.574 --> 26:46.605
Or could they have been fleeing
for their lives?

26:46.681 --> 26:49.839
For Giorgio and David,

26:49.994 --> 26:53.212
these questions form the pieces
of a confounding puzzle,

26:53.367 --> 26:55.030
one they are both determined
to solve

26:55.054 --> 26:58.059
before they return home.

27:06.127 --> 27:08.125
While visiting
the ancient site known

27:08.127 --> 27:12.039
as I'ipona, located
in the Marquesas Islands,

27:12.214 --> 27:14.139
local guide Heimata Bonno

27:14.161 --> 27:16.281
has just shown
ancient astronaut theorists

27:16.401 --> 27:19.139
Giorgio Tsoukalos
and David Childress

27:19.294 --> 27:21.445
a number of sacred tiki statues

27:21.601 --> 27:24.172
which have six fingers
on each hand.

27:24.174 --> 27:26.685
That is, uh,
very interesting to me.

27:26.861 --> 27:30.352
He has also just
informed them that the tiki gods

27:30.354 --> 27:32.277
were believed by the natives
to possess

27:32.301 --> 27:35.165
an extraordinary amount
of what they called "mana,"

27:35.221 --> 27:37.305
a spiritual power,

27:37.307 --> 27:40.139
which, if consumed,
would make the natives strong

27:40.294 --> 27:42.419
and virtually invincible.

27:42.421 --> 27:44.959
So, how-how does this tiki
have mana?

27:44.981 --> 27:46.859
How does it get the mana?

28:03.661 --> 28:05.219
I see.

28:05.374 --> 28:07.385
Eat the mana?

28:07.387 --> 28:10.999
Is Heimata Bonno describing
a form of ritual cannibalism

28:11.174 --> 28:14.219
in which the natives of the
Marquesas would eat the bodies

28:14.374 --> 28:17.979
of those who they believed
possessed spiritual power?

28:18.154 --> 28:20.679
And where is the mana contained?

28:20.681 --> 28:22.979
The mana's coming out
of the eyes, right? Or...

28:27.821 --> 28:29.365
So they would...

28:29.521 --> 28:31.545
eat the eyes and the tongue,

28:31.701 --> 28:33.159
the brain?

28:42.994 --> 28:44.939
Is it possible that the natives

28:44.961 --> 28:48.039
of the Marquesas Islands
believed that the mana,

28:48.194 --> 28:50.319
or spiritual power,

28:50.341 --> 28:53.905
of their tiki gods
could be literally consumed?

28:54.061 --> 28:56.699
If so, was their eagerness

28:56.701 --> 28:58.737
to eat the organs
not only of the tiki,

28:58.761 --> 29:01.932
but of their offspring,
one of the chief reasons

29:01.941 --> 29:04.039
why the so-called seven brothers

29:04.061 --> 29:06.061
fled the Marquesas
for Easter Island

29:06.094 --> 29:09.199
thousands of years ago?

29:09.374 --> 29:12.385
Here there are
very large boulders

29:12.541 --> 29:13.852
of basalt.

29:14.007 --> 29:15.792
It's very heavy.

29:15.794 --> 29:17.872
I know in some places
in Polynesia

29:17.874 --> 29:20.079
and Micronesia they have legends

29:20.234 --> 29:23.119
that the stones are...
are flying through the air.

29:33.661 --> 29:35.563
So they are giants
and very strong,

29:35.587 --> 29:38.559
and they can lift
these big stones?

29:46.367 --> 29:49.499
- Oh.
- Giant bones?

29:49.654 --> 29:52.592
Found in caves
on the Marquesas Islands?

29:52.701 --> 29:54.225
Could this be the evidence

29:54.381 --> 29:56.652
Giorgio and David
have been searching for

29:56.741 --> 30:00.399
that suggest the early
inhabitants of Easter Island

30:00.401 --> 30:03.732
were, in fact,
giant alien hybrid beings?

30:03.821 --> 30:06.885
Beings who forged
a colony of giants

30:06.961 --> 30:09.445
much like themselves,

30:09.601 --> 30:11.825
and who commemorated
their time on the island

30:11.981 --> 30:14.419
by fashioning
giant stone sentinels.

30:16.307 --> 30:20.099
We have these stories
of giants worldwide.

30:20.141 --> 30:24.505
In Malta, we have some
of <i> the</i> biggest megalithic sites

30:24.561 --> 30:28.079
in all of Europe,
that allegedly were built

30:28.101 --> 30:29.959
by the giants.

30:30.114 --> 30:33.105
The giants were offspring

30:33.107 --> 30:37.512
of the gods after they mated
with human women.

30:37.687 --> 30:42.439
Then you have stories
of the giants on Sardinia,

30:42.614 --> 30:45.819
many of whom have been suggested
were originated

30:45.994 --> 30:49.199
by extraterrestrials.

30:49.374 --> 30:52.232
The origin story
of the giants in the Bible

30:52.407 --> 30:55.759
is that angels mated
with human women.

30:57.381 --> 31:00.665
The offspring were the giants.

31:00.841 --> 31:03.119
So we have to wonder,

31:03.121 --> 31:07.099
are the seven sentinels
actually giants?

31:07.254 --> 31:10.432
Part alien and part human.

31:10.521 --> 31:13.372
...Perhaps they were escaping

31:13.374 --> 31:16.419
the Marquesas Islands
because they were

31:16.441 --> 31:18.105
the ruling elite,

31:18.107 --> 31:20.732
and essentially,
they were overthrown

31:20.821 --> 31:22.499
because they had this power,

31:22.541 --> 31:24.739
and they went to Easter Island.

31:27.001 --> 31:30.539
Heimata, it's been
so interesting here.

31:30.694 --> 31:34.299
You have such good information.
I really appreciate it.

31:34.474 --> 31:35.594
Yeah, thank you for sharing.

31:35.721 --> 31:36.912
You're welcome.

31:37.001 --> 31:38.445
Could it be that

31:38.501 --> 31:40.859
the so-called seven princes
of the Marquesas

31:40.881 --> 31:43.865
were giant alien-human hybrids?

31:44.021 --> 31:48.085
Hybrids who may have had access
to extraterrestrial technologies

31:48.141 --> 31:50.825
that caused them
to be thought of by the natives

31:50.901 --> 31:53.519
as kings or gods?

31:55.314 --> 31:58.859
And if so, could it be
that the real reason

31:59.014 --> 32:01.345
these seven brothers left
the Marquesas

32:01.401 --> 32:03.972
was not because
they were fighting,

32:04.081 --> 32:07.025
but because they were fleeing
for their lives,

32:07.027 --> 32:11.025
in fear of being killed
and eaten by the natives?

32:11.081 --> 32:14.332
Ancient astronaut theorists
say the answer

32:14.341 --> 32:16.185
is a profound yes,

32:16.261 --> 32:18.919
and believe that
even more answers can be found

32:19.074 --> 32:23.279
not only by examining the
stone statues of Easter Island,

32:23.301 --> 32:25.639
but by also taking a closer look

32:25.794 --> 32:27.852
at what some of them are wearing

32:28.007 --> 32:29.719
on their heads.

32:36.307 --> 32:38.745
Isolated in the vast expanse

32:38.821 --> 32:42.419
of the South Pacific,
Easter Island remains

32:42.441 --> 32:46.032
a land of mystery.

32:46.041 --> 32:50.739
Since its discovery by Europeans
in the 18th century,

32:50.894 --> 32:53.612
very little is still known about
the people who once lived there,

32:53.701 --> 32:56.299
or their origins.

32:56.454 --> 32:59.152
But of all the mysteries
involving the island

32:59.327 --> 33:02.059
otherwise known as Rapa Nui,

33:02.081 --> 33:04.819
the most persistent involve

33:04.841 --> 33:09.099
the nearly 900 megalithic
statues known as moai,

33:09.254 --> 33:13.145
and why they were put here
in the first place.

33:13.301 --> 33:16.312
The moai are considered to be

33:16.321 --> 33:19.779
no more than perhaps
a thousand years old.

33:19.821 --> 33:22.939
However, it has been established

33:23.094 --> 33:26.279
that some of them penetrate
down into the ground

33:26.434 --> 33:29.172
by a great amount of feet

33:29.174 --> 33:31.439
to reveal the rest of the body,

33:31.441 --> 33:33.605
not just the oversized head.

33:33.661 --> 33:37.725
And the amount
of catenation suggests

33:37.901 --> 33:40.532
that they are infinitely older

33:40.687 --> 33:42.679
than a thousand years.

33:42.721 --> 33:46.459
They could go back many,
many, many millennia.

33:48.041 --> 33:49.325
When you visit Easter Island,

33:49.381 --> 33:52.319
and you look at
the sights there, the statues,

33:52.341 --> 33:55.265
the megalithic walls,
you realize they're much older

33:55.267 --> 33:57.519
than what, you know,
history tells us.

33:59.021 --> 34:01.499
Further clouding the issue

34:01.654 --> 34:05.659
is a discovery
that was made in 2017.

34:05.814 --> 34:09.472
With the help of photography
and 3-D modeling programs,

34:09.647 --> 34:13.978
archaeologists discovered
that the 13-ton stone hats,

34:13.981 --> 34:17.219
known as <i> pukao,</i>
on the Easter Island moai

34:17.241 --> 34:19.992
contain a wide diversity
of petroglyphs,

34:20.147 --> 34:23.079
made by what appear to be
different groups of people.

34:25.487 --> 34:29.592
The hats that are on top
of the Easter Island moai

34:29.746 --> 34:31.379
are a little bit of a mystery.

34:31.554 --> 34:33.779
But recently, they've
been analyzed, and carvings

34:33.801 --> 34:36.652
have been found on them,
which has, like, questioned,

34:36.806 --> 34:40.205
you know, the idea
of what they really represent.

34:40.261 --> 34:42.579
Perhaps there is
something else going on here.

34:42.601 --> 34:44.545
It could well be

34:44.701 --> 34:46.958
that a number
of different cultures

34:46.981 --> 34:49.119
lived on Easter Island.

34:51.706 --> 34:55.279
One of the most fascinating
monuments on Easter Island

34:55.434 --> 34:58.805
is the stone platform, or <i> ahu,</i>

34:58.881 --> 35:01.152
known as Vinapu.

35:01.154 --> 35:04.565
And this is a huge
megalithic construction

35:04.621 --> 35:06.872
that is essentially a wall

35:07.027 --> 35:10.452
made of cyclopean
megalithic blocks

35:10.607 --> 35:13.939
that all interlock
with each other.

35:13.961 --> 35:17.972
When you look at this,
you cannot help but think

35:17.981 --> 35:21.752
of Cuzco in Peru.

35:21.927 --> 35:24.379
And there has to be
a relationship

35:24.401 --> 35:26.059
between the two cultures.

35:26.234 --> 35:27.932
All of these

35:28.087 --> 35:31.952
part of a much bigger
transmission of knowledge,

35:31.954 --> 35:34.445
where the belief,

35:34.447 --> 35:38.279
the common belief was
an origin amongst the stars.

35:42.087 --> 35:44.792
If, as ancient
astronaut theorists suggest,

35:44.881 --> 35:48.052
the seven moai
that face out to sea

35:48.054 --> 35:51.832
really do represent a race
of giant alien hybrid beings

35:51.834 --> 35:55.292
that fled the Marquesas Islands
hundreds, and perhaps thousands,

35:55.294 --> 35:57.205
of years ago,

35:57.361 --> 36:00.539
do the hundreds of other moai

36:00.561 --> 36:02.625
represent their offspring?

36:02.681 --> 36:04.705
And if so,

36:04.881 --> 36:07.892
could they have had contact
with other parts of the world,

36:07.981 --> 36:10.699
making Easter Island
a virtual hub

36:10.854 --> 36:13.319
of extraterrestrial activity?

36:15.161 --> 36:18.559
Easter Island has also got

36:18.714 --> 36:21.659
the strong legend that it is
the center of the world,

36:21.814 --> 36:24.485
or the "navel of the world."

36:24.641 --> 36:27.872
And there are various places
around our planet

36:28.027 --> 36:31.105
that are said to be
the "navel of the world."

36:31.281 --> 36:32.832
They're in Cuzco,

36:32.921 --> 36:34.865
at Delphi in Greece,

36:35.021 --> 36:36.519
at Sardinia,

36:36.674 --> 36:38.412
and in Egypt.

36:38.521 --> 36:41.925
In many cases,
there's a stone ball

36:41.927 --> 36:45.392
that is marking
this center-of-the-world spot.

36:45.567 --> 36:48.085
And we have that
at Easter Island.

36:48.087 --> 36:50.105
These navels of the world

36:50.107 --> 36:52.872
are apparently power places,

36:52.874 --> 36:55.932
places of vortex, energy.

36:56.087 --> 36:58.150
It would seem that
they are all connected

36:58.174 --> 37:02.292
to this worldwide energy grid.

37:02.294 --> 37:07.145
Why did this huge
megalithic culture emerge here?

37:07.147 --> 37:09.745
Perhaps this tells us

37:09.921 --> 37:12.239
that there is
some special quality

37:12.241 --> 37:14.365
with Easter Island,

37:14.521 --> 37:17.445
one that was recognized
by the ancestors

37:17.601 --> 37:19.919
of the Rapa Nui culture.

37:21.761 --> 37:23.992
Were the seven moai
that face the sea

37:23.994 --> 37:26.559
positioned so as to indicate
a warning

37:26.561 --> 37:29.239
to those natives
on the Marquesas that wanted

37:29.414 --> 37:33.052
to hunt them and eat them
for their power?

37:33.227 --> 37:36.732
Or were they meant to serve
as a commemoration

37:36.887 --> 37:40.732
not only of Easter Island's
extraterrestrial origins

37:40.887 --> 37:45.832
but of the history
of alien activity on our planet?

37:45.987 --> 37:49.565
As far as Giorgio Tsoukalos and
David Childress are concerned,

37:49.721 --> 37:52.185
there still needs to be
further investigation

37:52.261 --> 37:56.079
before those questions
can be answered.

38:01.701 --> 38:04.299
On the last day
of their incredible journey

38:04.474 --> 38:06.399
to the Marquesas Islands,

38:06.554 --> 38:09.012
ancient astronaut theorists
Giorgio Tsoukalos

38:09.167 --> 38:10.879
and David Childress

38:10.881 --> 38:14.252
meet at a café
on the island of Nuku Hiva.

38:14.254 --> 38:17.359
They are confident
that their investigation

38:17.361 --> 38:20.259
has led to not only evidence
of a direct link

38:20.281 --> 38:22.959
between the Marquesas
and Easter Island

38:23.114 --> 38:25.379
but also a greater understanding

38:25.554 --> 38:28.632
as to the kinds of beings
who lived on these islands

38:28.787 --> 38:31.452
thousands of years ago.

38:31.541 --> 38:35.759
Well, this was an in...
incredible experience.

38:35.761 --> 38:38.492
From all the people we've talked
to, these ancient civilizations

38:38.647 --> 38:43.425
are way older
than what we were taught.

38:43.581 --> 38:45.159
Yeah, you have
these strong connections

38:45.181 --> 38:47.181
from the Marquesas
to Easter Island.

38:47.287 --> 38:50.685
And the idea
of the-the flying turtle

38:50.841 --> 38:52.712
would be what you would think of
as a disc...

38:52.714 --> 38:54.639
- Yes.
- ...flying.

38:54.814 --> 38:57.439
They knew
that turtles don't fly.

38:57.441 --> 39:01.185
So why would they have stories
of flying turtles?

39:01.361 --> 39:05.245
If we had, uh,
airships landing here,

39:05.401 --> 39:08.632
and then the people
are-are wondering,

39:08.634 --> 39:10.739
how do these turtles fly?

39:10.741 --> 39:13.245
- Yes.
- And the extraterrestrials

39:13.401 --> 39:17.465
tell them,
"Well, they fly with this energy

39:17.621 --> 39:19.505
- "called mana."
- Mm-hmm.

39:19.507 --> 39:23.892
And there, they transcribe this
mana energy to-to everything.

39:24.047 --> 39:26.719
And, you know, it...
the-the tikis have the mana,

39:26.721 --> 39:28.365
the stones have the mana.

39:28.541 --> 39:30.432
Uh, mana's everywhere.

39:30.587 --> 39:34.185
And, all of a sudden, something
that was technological in origin

39:34.187 --> 39:35.565
becomes magic.

39:35.567 --> 39:37.379
It becomes sorcery.

39:37.401 --> 39:39.472
It becomes something divine.

39:39.474 --> 39:42.359
Everything
that they're talking about

39:42.514 --> 39:45.199
and depicting would seem
to be extraterrestrial.

39:45.201 --> 39:47.959
One of my favorite pieces
that we saw

39:48.001 --> 39:51.759
was that tiki of this woman
laying on the stomach

39:51.781 --> 39:54.145
and she's giving birth.

39:54.301 --> 39:57.159
But that's not the position
in which to deliver a baby.

39:57.334 --> 40:00.645
To me, it looks like some sort
of a flying object,

40:00.821 --> 40:04.252
where passengers
are disembarking, or pilots.

40:04.407 --> 40:09.199
And if this is seen by someone
who has never seen an airplane,

40:09.221 --> 40:11.110
well, then,
for all intents and purposes,

40:11.134 --> 40:13.212
that thing is giving birth.

40:13.214 --> 40:16.139
So, to me,
it's a... it's a wonderful

40:16.294 --> 40:19.265
and interesting
misunderstanding.

40:19.441 --> 40:21.565
It really shows,
I think, this connection

40:21.721 --> 40:23.859
between the Marquesas,

40:24.014 --> 40:28.705
perhaps also that these places
are-are space ports,

40:28.707 --> 40:29.707
in a sense.

40:31.781 --> 40:34.119
And isn't necessarily, uh,

40:34.274 --> 40:37.539
the way that Western
archaeologists tell the story.

40:39.801 --> 40:42.019
Whether it is tikis here
in the Marquesas

40:42.041 --> 40:44.905
or moai in Easter Island,

40:45.061 --> 40:48.145
we're looking
at misunderstood technology.

40:48.301 --> 40:51.172
Because I think
that when you combine this

40:51.261 --> 40:53.439
with the old stories of legends

40:53.594 --> 40:55.514
of people descending
from the sky

40:55.587 --> 40:58.585
with a lot
of noise, smoke and fire,

40:58.741 --> 41:01.125
those depictions may represent

41:01.201 --> 41:03.925
either
extraterrestrials themselves

41:04.081 --> 41:08.419
or craft
that the extraterrestrials used.

41:08.441 --> 41:12.865
Were the seven stone
sentinels of Easter Island

41:12.867 --> 41:15.725
placed there to commemorate
what may once have been

41:15.727 --> 41:17.459
a land of giant hybrids,

41:17.614 --> 41:22.059
part human and part alien?

41:22.081 --> 41:26.039
As far as Giorgio Tsoukalos and
David Childress are concerned,

41:26.214 --> 41:29.699
the answer is a profound yes.

41:29.721 --> 41:32.605
They also believe the ancient
moai on Easter Island

41:32.607 --> 41:34.239
now serve a different,

41:34.394 --> 41:37.699
if perhaps unintended, purpose.

41:37.854 --> 41:40.165
Instead
of silently standing guard,

41:40.341 --> 41:43.145
as if to protect the island
and its secrets,

41:43.147 --> 41:46.845
the moai might actually be
helping to reveal the truth

41:46.847 --> 41:50.239
about mankind's
extraterrestrial history,

41:50.394 --> 41:54.625
a history that may very soon
repeat itself when we,

41:54.627 --> 41:58.032
in the not-so-distant future,
could come face-to-face

41:58.187 --> 42:01.045
with those same alien visitors

42:01.201 --> 42:05.012
who were once immortalized
in stone.
