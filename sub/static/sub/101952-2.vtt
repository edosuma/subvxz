so Zoey and I have decided
it's time

40:24.620 --> 40:27.243
to change things up a bit.

40:27.343 --> 40:28.964
With that in mind,

40:29.064 --> 40:31.827
I'd like to introduce
a few new members to our group.

40:35.270 --> 40:36.211
- I don't get it.

40:36.311 --> 40:38.173
Why do these programmers
look like girls?

40:38.273 --> 40:40.415
- Oh, we're playing
a new game today.

40:40.515 --> 40:42.818
It's called "Find Your Seats
on the Fifth Floor."

40:42.918 --> 40:44.139
- I don't know.

40:44.239 --> 40:46.662
That sounds like
a terrible name for a game.

40:46.762 --> 40:49.424
- Huh. Jared, Gabe, Kevin,

40:49.524 --> 40:51.466
HR's already been notified
of your transfers.

40:51.566 --> 40:55.430
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, not Gabe.

40:55.530 --> 40:58.393
Hey, man, um, what are you--
what are you doing?

40:58.493 --> 41:02.597
We're called "the brogrammers"
for a reason.

41:02.697 --> 41:04.439
- Not anymore.

41:04.539 --> 41:09.324
McKenzie, Yasmeen, Cass,
welcome to the fourth floor.

41:09.424 --> 41:12.607
- Okay, I don't know
about Extreme Marker Jousting,

41:12.707 --> 41:14.849
but I'm down to play Nut Punch.

41:14.949 --> 41:16.931
Who wants to go first?

41:17.031 --> 41:19.253
♪ ♪

41:19.353 --> 41:21.976
[pop music]

41:22.076 --> 41:23.297
- Uh-huh, look at that.

41:23.397 --> 41:24.939
I found that second typo
you were talking about,

41:25.039 --> 41:26.220
and you are right.

41:26.320 --> 41:29.003
This is the least
intimidating contract ever.

41:30.484 --> 41:32.146
- Whoo-whoo!

41:32.246 --> 41:34.028
Finally!

41:34.128 --> 41:36.590
I am so happy for you guys.

41:36.690 --> 41:39.714
The world better
expect big things.

41:39.814 --> 41:41.836
- Wait a minute.
I just realized something.

41:41.936 --> 41:43.157
- Oh, no, what?

41:43.257 --> 41:46.280
- Today I got into bed
with both of my friends.

41:46.380 --> 41:48.802
- [muffled] I don't like
the sound of that.

41:48.902 --> 41:51.165
- I feel dirty now.
- What? It's a metaphor.

41:51.265 --> 41:52.446
- It makes me want
to scratch you

41:52.546 --> 41:54.528
with these fake nails
that Mo glued on me.

41:54.628 --> 41:56.890
- Mm-mm, don't do that.
Those things are a work of art.

41:56.990 --> 41:58.071
And we haven't even done
your photo shoot yet.

41:58.152 --> 41:59.253
So come on.
- My what?

41:59.353 --> 42:00.734
- [muffled] Photo shoot.
- Oh.

42:00.834 --> 42:01.735
- I didn't agree to that.
- Yes, you did.

42:01.835 --> 42:03.337
Smile.
- Fashion spread.

42:03.437 --> 42:05.859
- Oh, it's a selfie. Smile.
Let's do it up here.

42:05.959 --> 42:07.701
- Is it bad that I think I like
this version of you better?

42:07.801 --> 42:08.982
- Yeah, definitely.

42:09.082 --> 42:12.506
- Posh Spice, Baby Spice.
- Hey, I want...

42:12.606 --> 42:14.608
- Victoria Beckham.
