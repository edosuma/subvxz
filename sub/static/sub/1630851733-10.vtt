WEBVTT

00:01.134 --> 00:04.671
- And then there were three.
(suspenseful music)

00:04.671 --> 00:06.173
- It's happening!

00:06.173 --> 00:08.475
- [Guest Judge] Fire and Icesis!

00:08.475 --> 00:10.143
- [Brad] You just elevated

00:10.143 --> 00:12.379
the shit out of this challenge.

00:12.379 --> 00:13.747
- [Traci] I find you very
special.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.482
- Fuck yeah, bitches!

00:16.416 --> 00:17.784
- Pythia.
- Pythia.

00:17.784 --> 00:18.619
- Pythia.

00:19.486 --> 00:21.555
- When they say the art of drag,

00:21.555 --> 00:22.990
this is what they mean.

00:22.990 --> 00:24.725
Pythia, for me, is an original.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.526
Just next level.

00:26.526 --> 00:27.361
- Fuck me.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.695
- Okay, that could be arranged.

00:28.695 --> 00:32.099
- [Brad] You came on to
the stage ready to play.

00:32.099 --> 00:33.533
(laughing)

00:33.533 --> 00:36.370
- The only one that matters is
Kendall.

00:36.370 --> 00:39.172
- [Brooke Lynn] You really just
knocked it out of the park.

00:39.172 --> 00:40.707
- [Amanda] I loved your energy.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.042
- [Brooke Lynn] You were always
such a joy

00:42.042 --> 00:43.610
to see walk down the runway.

00:43.610 --> 00:46.480
- I was obsessed with it!
(laughing)

00:46.480 --> 00:48.382
- And scene.
(suspenseful music)

00:48.382 --> 00:51.585
- [Brooke Lynn] The battle for
the crown starts right now.

00:51.585 --> 00:52.452
- This is it.

00:52.452 --> 00:55.055
This is what we have worked so
hard for.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.091
- I'm here to slay the
competition.

00:58.091 --> 00:59.927
- I'm Canada's next drag
superstar.

00:59.927 --> 01:01.862
(RuPaul laughs maniacally)
(suspenseful music)

01:01.862 --> 01:05.265
- [Brooke Lynn] Let the battle
begin.

01:05.265 --> 01:08.669
(upbeat music)

01:08.669 --> 01:12.306
- Girl, I'm the Beyonce, okay?
(all laughing)

01:12.306 --> 01:14.107
Oh my god.
- Oh my god.

01:15.943 --> 01:18.779
- Gia has now been eliminated.

01:18.779 --> 01:22.316
I always pictured me and
Gia going all the way

01:22.316 --> 01:24.351
to the very very end.

01:24.351 --> 01:25.619
So this is sad.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.623
- I left my heart and
soul and on that stage.

01:29.623 --> 01:30.857
I love you all.

01:31.892 --> 01:33.493
- Aww, G.

01:33.493 --> 01:34.594
- What a star.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.263
Like, I have grown to just like,

01:36.263 --> 01:37.764
absolutely adore that bitch.

01:37.764 --> 01:38.765
- Yeah, me too.
- Same.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.234
- Well, it's time to move on.

01:41.234 --> 01:42.869
Ooh, I've never done this
before!

01:42.869 --> 01:44.738
- Oh you haven't?
- Oh it is your first time!

01:44.738 --> 01:45.572
(laughing)

01:45.572 --> 01:46.807
- Doing the circle.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.475
Aw, bye Gia.

01:48.475 --> 01:50.010
- I love you, girl.
- We love you.

01:50.010 --> 01:51.211
- Love you, girl.

01:51.211 --> 01:53.447
- And she's a fucking icon.
(smooching)

01:53.447 --> 01:56.249
(Queens wailing)

01:56.249 --> 01:59.987
- Top three!
(laughing)

01:59.987 --> 02:03.323
- Where did all of that come
from, Pythia?

02:03.323 --> 02:04.491
- Literally.
- Not some of this.

02:04.491 --> 02:05.325
Not this!
- This, girl, this!

02:05.325 --> 02:06.159
It was the, girl no,

02:06.159 --> 02:07.027
it was the vogueing for me.

02:07.027 --> 02:08.762
- And you did it with such,
like,

02:08.762 --> 02:09.763
oh my gosh.
- Yes, girl.

02:09.763 --> 02:10.764
She said Paris is burning,

02:10.764 --> 02:12.466
but she said Athens is burning.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.567
(all laughing)

02:13.567 --> 02:15.135
- Athens is burning!

02:15.135 --> 02:17.170
We are the top of the top.

02:17.170 --> 02:19.172
This sisterhood that I have
with Icesis and Kendall

02:19.172 --> 02:20.841
is so strong and powerful.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.409
But you know, at the end of the
day,

02:22.409 --> 02:23.543
it's a competition,

02:23.543 --> 02:25.312
and if I have to cut up some
wigs

02:25.312 --> 02:27.047
and set some clothes on fire to
win,

02:27.047 --> 02:29.182
maybe I'll do that, who knows?

02:29.182 --> 02:31.118
No no no, I play fair.

02:31.118 --> 02:32.753
- So grandma.

02:32.753 --> 02:33.587
How are the knees?

02:33.587 --> 02:35.455
Because bitch jumped and went
down.

02:35.455 --> 02:38.959
And we know you ain't got good
knees.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.460
- They are just fine.
(knees cracking)

02:40.460 --> 02:41.595
- I heard a crack!

02:41.595 --> 02:44.898
I heard the crack!
- Shush! Shush!

02:44.898 --> 02:46.833
- I heard the crack.
(laughing)

02:46.833 --> 02:50.003
- We are top three!
(suspenseful music)

02:50.003 --> 02:51.671
(Queens screaming)

02:51.671 --> 02:52.773
- It's anyone's battle,

02:52.773 --> 02:54.307
but I feel like a crown

02:54.307 --> 02:58.145
would look real correct on this
head.

02:58.145 --> 02:59.946
Oh, that feels so good.

02:59.946 --> 03:02.916
- This competition has taken my
knees.

03:02.916 --> 03:05.185
It has taken my patience.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.788
It has taken the last bit of
youth

03:07.788 --> 03:09.790
that was left inside of me.

03:09.790 --> 03:12.259
But they're sizing me up for my
crown.

03:12.259 --> 03:13.894
You can't keep a good bitch
down.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.129
Let me tell you that, baby!

03:16.129 --> 03:18.265
- Don't tip me, honey.

We are literally losing our
minds.

04:07.814 --> 04:11.151
We are so happy and so proud to
be here.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.422
All three of us earned
our spot in this finale,

04:15.422 --> 04:18.825
and we could not possibly
be more different.

04:18.825 --> 04:19.659
- From the get-go,

04:19.659 --> 04:22.062
my eye just went directly to
you.

04:22.062 --> 04:27.000
You were the type of drag
that, like, I enjoy looking at.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.569
You have such a specific
lane that you're in.

04:29.569 --> 04:32.806
Being able to do something like
Drag Race.

04:32.806 --> 04:35.208
Girl, you did so well.
- Yeah.

04:35.208 --> 04:37.844
- I think I have the
best track record here.

04:37.844 --> 04:40.046
So just give it to me.

04:40.046 --> 04:42.149
Give me the crown already.

04:42.149 --> 04:44.317
- I didn't know who you
were before you walked in,

04:44.317 --> 04:46.086
but the second that I saw that
mug,

04:46.086 --> 04:47.454
and I saw your (indistinct)
outfit, bitch,

04:47.454 --> 04:48.522
that I knew.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.923
I knew.
- Aw, thank you.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.091
- You I've known for a while,

04:51.091 --> 04:53.093
and I knew, they're in the top
with me.

04:53.093 --> 04:53.927
You know?
- Yay!

04:53.927 --> 04:54.761
- It felt right.

04:54.761 --> 04:56.796
I was like, there's no other
way.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.198
And also like, I was like, damn,

04:58.198 --> 05:00.333
how many ways can she wear a
body suit?

05:00.333 --> 05:02.102
- I knew it!
(all laughing)

05:02.102 --> 05:02.969
- That was the biggest surprise.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.404
- Three ways.

05:04.404 --> 05:05.939
- They gotta pick on something
when you're that flawless.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.174
- Exactly!
- Aye!

05:07.174 --> 05:08.875

Are you that girl?

05:27.928 --> 05:30.497
To rule all of Canada,

05:30.497 --> 05:32.532
only one will go forth

05:32.532 --> 05:35.435
to represent all the queers

05:35.435 --> 05:38.238
as their Queen of the North.

05:38.238 --> 05:39.072
- Aw!

- Come on, top three!

05:41.942 --> 05:43.677
Come on, season two!

05:43.677 --> 05:45.078
Come on, Canada's Drag Race!

05:45.078 --> 05:48.548

05:48.548 --> 05:49.683
- My Queens.

Your coronations is almost upon
us.

05:52.219 --> 05:53.820

crowned

05:55.655 --> 05:58.058
Canada's next drag superstar.

05:59.459 --> 06:00.827
But not the Queen of the North,

06:00.827 --> 06:02.696
'cause that's my fucking title.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.030
- Okay.

06:04.030 --> 06:04.864
- Just so we're clear.

06:04.864 --> 06:05.699
You can be a Duchess,

06:05.699 --> 06:06.800
you can be a Countess,

06:06.800 --> 06:08.034
you can be a Princess,

06:08.034 --> 06:09.736
you can be a Viscountess.

06:09.736 --> 06:10.971
Just not the Queen of the North.

06:10.971 --> 06:11.905
(laughing)

06:11.905 --> 06:15.342
For your final maxi
challenge of the season,

06:15.342 --> 06:17.744
you'll be writing and recording

06:17.744 --> 06:20.580
a brand new remix to my song,

06:20.580 --> 06:22.015
"Queen of the North,"

06:22.015 --> 06:24.551
written by Stacy Kay and Leah
Canali.

06:24.551 --> 06:27.254
(Queens screaming)

06:27.254 --> 06:28.088
- Oh my God.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.489
That's fucking cool.

06:29.489 --> 06:31.324
- You will be in the recording
booth,

06:31.324 --> 06:34.728
working with none other than
moi.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.463
(Queens laughing)

06:36.463 --> 06:39.432
You will then learn
some fierce choreography

06:39.432 --> 06:41.134
from the one, the only,

06:41.134 --> 06:44.504
Miss Hollywood Jade.
(Queens laughing)

06:44.504 --> 06:45.438
- My girl!

06:45.438 --> 06:46.973
- No!

06:46.973 --> 06:48.608
No!

06:48.608 --> 06:49.976
- She's out.
(laughing)

06:49.976 --> 06:52.479
- If I can not nail this
choreography,

06:52.479 --> 06:54.981
it will affect me getting to the
crown,

06:54.981 --> 06:57.484
and I did not make it this far

06:57.484 --> 06:59.052
to not be the winner.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.153
- And on the runway,

07:00.153 --> 07:03.657
you better bring your
best coronation eleganza.

07:03.657 --> 07:06.159
Because bitch, we're crowning!

07:07.360 --> 07:09.729
But before you become pop
princesses,

07:09.729 --> 07:10.897
you'll be doing a photo shoot

07:10.897 --> 07:13.066
with a very special guest.

07:14.734 --> 07:17.103
Racers, last time I get to say
this.

07:17.103 --> 07:17.937
(all giggling)

07:17.937 --> 07:20.173
Start your engines!

07:20.173 --> 07:22.942
And may the best drag Queen win!

07:22.942 --> 07:25.412
(all laughing)
(suspenseful music)

07:25.412 --> 07:27.380
- That's how it's done,
beautiful.

07:27.380 --> 07:30.283
(upbeat music)

07:30.283 --> 07:31.284
- Oh, what?

07:31.284 --> 07:32.285

07:32.285 --> 07:33.853
- What's my name?

07:33.853 --> 07:35.388
- Priyanka!

07:35.388 --> 07:37.157
- Come join me!
- How are you?

07:37.157 --> 07:39.192
- Hi!
(kissing)

07:39.192 --> 07:40.026
I was just here,

07:40.026 --> 07:43.196
enjoying the last few minutes of
my reign.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.197
So if you could just excuse me.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.398
(laughing)

07:45.398 --> 07:46.299
- No bitch, it's mine.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.267
- No, it's mine.
- No, it's mine.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.501
- No, it's mine.
- You're fine.

07:48.501 --> 07:49.602
It's fine, really, and truly,
it's fine.

07:49.602 --> 07:50.437
What's my name?

07:50.437 --> 07:52.005
Not Pythia, it's Priyanka.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.873
Ha ha, whatever.
(laughing)

07:53.873 --> 07:54.741
- I love Priyanka.

07:54.741 --> 07:56.609
She is such a powerful energy.

07:56.609 --> 07:59.245
She is Canada's first drag
superstar,

07:59.245 --> 08:01.481
and I think she has something of
mine.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.183
(laughing)

08:03.183 --> 08:06.019
- Being Canada's first ever drag
superstar

08:06.019 --> 08:08.088
truly changed my life.
- Yes.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.490
- Are you ready for it to
maybe change your life?

08:10.490 --> 08:11.825
- I am ready for it to change my
life,

08:11.825 --> 08:13.059
but also, like,

08:13.059 --> 08:14.961
everybody else's life
that I'm going to touch.

08:14.961 --> 08:15.795
You know what I mean?

08:15.795 --> 08:16.629
- Yeah.

08:16.629 --> 08:18.732
- I represent the underground
scene,

08:18.732 --> 08:22.135
the non-binary, trans
folk, the drag kings,

08:22.135 --> 08:24.204
Queens, things, monsters.

08:24.204 --> 08:26.172
I want to give back to my
community,

08:26.172 --> 08:27.841
and bring everybody to the
forefront,

08:27.841 --> 08:29.442
and just let the monsters reign!

08:29.442 --> 08:30.477
(laughing)

08:30.477 --> 08:31.945
- What's your journey been?

08:31.945 --> 08:32.779
- It's been amazing.

08:32.779 --> 08:35.348
Honestly, like, I have been
sort of consistently in the top,

08:35.348 --> 08:36.149
except for the roast,

08:36.149 --> 08:37.050
which we're not gonna talk
about.

08:37.050 --> 08:37.917
(laughing)

08:37.917 --> 08:38.985
It was like a weak moment for
me,

08:38.985 --> 08:41.354
and I kinda like, got in my
head.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.322
Right before I went on.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.691
And it kinda like worked
against me, obviously.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.860
- I love seeing your body hair.

08:46.860 --> 08:47.894
- Thank you.
- Chest hair out,

08:47.894 --> 08:49.562
ready to play.
- Oh yes, 100%.

08:49.562 --> 08:50.897
- Like, explain the look to me.

08:50.897 --> 08:52.365
- I just really want to
celebrate my body,

08:52.365 --> 08:53.700
because I've spent so much time

08:53.700 --> 08:55.602
sort of hating myself for who I
am.

08:55.602 --> 08:58.738
And I don't necessarily
identify as male or female.

08:58.738 --> 09:00.874
I'm sort of in the non-binary
spectrum.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.643
And I really wanted to
showcase my best drag,

09:03.643 --> 09:05.845
as sort of, you know,
celebrating my body.

09:05.845 --> 09:07.881
- That's literally what
Canada's Drag Race is all about,

09:07.881 --> 09:08.815
is like celebrating-
- Oh, 100%.

09:08.815 --> 09:11.851
- Exactly who you are.
- 100%.

09:11.851 --> 09:12.919
- Are you ready for your
closeup?

09:12.919 --> 09:15.321
You are gonna direct me in a
photo shoot

09:15.321 --> 09:16.523
that we are gonna do together!

09:16.523 --> 09:17.924
- Oh my god, okay, let's do it.

09:17.924 --> 09:19.793
You are going to pass me that
crown,

09:19.793 --> 09:20.894
and repeat after me.
- Okay.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.563
- You are Canada's next drag
superstar.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.697
Not yet, not yet,
(laughing)

09:24.697 --> 09:25.665
just joking, just joking.

09:25.665 --> 09:28.034
I have to direct Priyanka
into this photo shoot,

09:28.034 --> 09:29.936
and I know exactly how I want it
to go.

09:29.936 --> 09:30.770
Hold up my leg.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.071
Hold up my leg, let's do it.
- Hold up your leg, alright.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.573
Oh yeah.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.742
(Priyanka wailing)

09:35.742 --> 09:36.910
- I think I like her on the
floor

09:36.910 --> 09:39.179
with my foot on her.
(laughing)

09:39.179 --> 09:41.381
It's over, bitch.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.683
This is Sparta!
(laughing)

09:43.683 --> 09:45.318
- You know, you could just leave
me here.

09:45.318 --> 09:46.286
- No, it's okay, it's okay.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.387
Here, thank you.
- I'll be okay.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.856
You have a good day.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.191
You have a good day.
(engines revving)

09:51.191 --> 09:52.959
- Great energy, Priyanka.
(upbeat music)

09:52.959 --> 09:55.995
(screaming)

09:55.995 --> 09:57.497
- Kendall!
- Bitch!

09:58.765 --> 10:00.567
- Oh my god, you look beautiful!

10:00.567 --> 10:02.068
- You too, sister!

10:04.037 --> 10:05.205
It's Priyanka!

10:06.272 --> 10:07.574
What's her name?

10:07.574 --> 10:08.908
And if you don't fucking
remember it,

10:08.908 --> 10:12.145
bitch has it all over her entire
outfit.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.513
- I'm working in the set deck
today.

10:13.513 --> 10:15.014
- Yes.
- So I'm gonna put you there.

10:15.014 --> 10:16.115
- Love it. Well, you need a new
job, babe.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.685
- I need a new-
(laughing)

10:18.685 --> 10:19.586
Wow, okay.

10:19.586 --> 10:22.088
So, how has your journey been?

10:22.088 --> 10:23.156
- It has been up and down.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.224
And like-
- Like you had

10:24.224 --> 10:25.291
your Miss Cleo moment?

10:25.291 --> 10:26.259
- Yeah!
(laughing)

10:26.259 --> 10:27.460
Not in Snatch Game, though, sis.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.929
It was the design
challenges for me, bitch.

10:29.929 --> 10:30.997
- Any wins?

10:30.997 --> 10:31.831
- Any wins, yeah.

10:31.831 --> 10:33.099
I won the comedy roast
challenge.

10:33.099 --> 10:34.033
- You're a comedy Queen?

10:34.033 --> 10:35.068
You're not funny!
(laughing)

10:35.068 --> 10:38.004
- Well, I'm funny looking,
bitch.

10:38.004 --> 10:38.838
- That's why you won.

10:38.838 --> 10:39.672
That's why you won.
- Yeah.

10:39.672 --> 10:40.874
- What would it mean to you,
like,

10:40.874 --> 10:41.741
to win this whole thing?

10:41.741 --> 10:43.109
- I feel like I've been
training my ass off

10:43.109 --> 10:46.045
for so many years in
so many different ways,

10:46.045 --> 10:47.280
and I'm just like,

10:47.280 --> 10:48.815
so excited to be able to get,
like,

10:48.815 --> 10:49.949
a platform like this,

10:49.949 --> 10:50.950
and an opportunity like this

10:50.950 --> 10:52.652
to share what I love,

10:52.652 --> 10:54.020
and what I love to do.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.555
- Are you ready for your
closeup?

10:55.555 --> 10:58.258
- Of course, bitch.
- So your gonna direct me,

10:58.258 --> 10:59.425
in a photo shoot.
- Oh my goodness.

10:59.425 --> 11:00.493
- That we're gonna do together.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.195
- Okay.
- Okay?

11:02.195 --> 11:05.131
- I sit and then you can stand
behind me.

11:05.131 --> 11:06.266
And kind of like,

11:06.266 --> 11:07.700
do a moment like this.
- Oh we're being fierce.

11:07.700 --> 11:09.736
- And you're like the villain.

11:09.736 --> 11:11.504
- I'm the villain.
- Yeah.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.740
- Wow. Here we go.

11:13.740 --> 11:16.276
Okay great, this is fun.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.111
Photographer man, do you like
this?

11:18.111 --> 11:19.512
- We are loving this.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.514
- This is cute, are we getting
ass?

11:21.514 --> 11:23.816
- Kendall, can I have you
on the other side, please?

11:23.816 --> 11:24.984
- Honey, I can go wherever you
want.

11:24.984 --> 11:26.920
- That's great.
(laughing)

11:26.920 --> 11:28.821
- Me and Priyanka are so
chaotic.

11:28.821 --> 11:31.491
Our energy is like, (wailing).

11:31.491 --> 11:33.993
So this is like a whole circus.

11:33.993 --> 11:35.728
- Try and snatch it from her,
Kendall.

11:35.728 --> 11:37.530
Yes!
- No bitch, it's mine!

11:37.530 --> 11:40.567
I don't want to be washed up!

11:40.567 --> 11:41.534
Love you bitch!

11:41.534 --> 11:43.970
Con-drag-ulations again.
- Thank you so much.

11:43.970 --> 11:47.707
- Bitch!
(laughing)

11:47.707 --> 11:48.741
Fuck off.

11:48.741 --> 11:50.543
- You.
- I'm here!

11:50.543 --> 11:53.513
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you, baby.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.381
The last time I saw Priyanka,

11:55.381 --> 11:56.950
I was opening for her.

11:56.950 --> 12:00.119
But now, I'm gonna snatch her
crown.

12:00.119 --> 12:01.521
- So how does it feel

12:01.521 --> 12:03.456
to be so close to the crown?

12:03.456 --> 12:05.558
- Girl, the journey I have been
on.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.061
I'm so happy that I
have been a part of it.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.129
I'm so happy I'm the first
Ottawa girl.

12:10.129 --> 12:12.432
- So how have you been in the
competition?

12:12.432 --> 12:14.300
- I've been doing really really
well.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.768
- Like lots of wins?

12:15.768 --> 12:16.669
- Two.
- Which ones?

12:16.669 --> 12:17.503
Which ones, which ones?

12:17.503 --> 12:18.938
I know nothing.
- Both were design challenges.

12:18.938 --> 12:20.006
- Oh!
- Yeah.

12:20.006 --> 12:20.840
- So why are you wearing this?

12:20.840 --> 12:22.742
I'm just joking.
(laughing)

12:22.742 --> 12:24.143
- Oh shit!

12:24.143 --> 12:25.745
- How confident were you

12:25.745 --> 12:27.080
that you'd be here in this
moment

12:27.080 --> 12:28.314
when you first came in?

12:28.314 --> 12:30.383
- I know I'm a good drag Queen.

12:30.383 --> 12:32.185
- I love that.
- And I know

12:32.185 --> 12:33.987
that this is where I need to be.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.321
- Did you learn anything
new about yourself?

12:35.321 --> 12:37.323
- I learned that I can
accomplish

12:37.323 --> 12:39.225
and do a lot more than I allow
myself

12:39.225 --> 12:40.326
to believe I can.

12:40.326 --> 12:41.227
- Wow.
- Yeah.

12:41.227 --> 12:43.730
Like, I'm so proud of myself.

12:43.730 --> 12:44.964
Like, it like,

12:44.964 --> 12:46.499
bitch, I can fucking do it.
- Yeah!

12:46.499 --> 12:47.500
- And I can do it all.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.334
- Did you ever doubt yourself?

12:48.334 --> 12:49.335
'Cause that happens in this
competition.

12:49.335 --> 12:50.203
I went through it.

12:50.203 --> 12:53.039
- It wasn't necessarily
that I doubted myself.

12:53.039 --> 12:56.109
It's more like this is just
so out of my comfort zone.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.244
And I just got in my head,

12:58.244 --> 13:00.647
because I care so much
about this competition.

13:00.647 --> 13:02.448
The hardest thing literally just
was

13:02.448 --> 13:03.850
getting out of my own way,

13:03.850 --> 13:05.118
and just having fun.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.586
But I did good on Snatch Game!

13:06.586 --> 13:07.420
Did you?

13:09.055 --> 13:11.457
- Alright, well that's a wrap.
(laughing)

13:11.457 --> 13:13.826
- Just kidding, girl.

13:13.826 --> 13:14.661
Let's do it.
- Ready?

13:14.661 --> 13:15.528
So we're just giving sexy, fun.

13:15.528 --> 13:16.362
- Yeah, let's do that,

13:16.362 --> 13:17.196
and then we'll do Prom.

13:17.196 --> 13:18.031
- Hot.
- Yeah.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.699
- [Photographer] Can I switch
you around?

13:19.699 --> 13:20.733
- Yes.
- Wow.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.035
- I think that's-
- This is my good side?

13:22.035 --> 13:23.469
- No, this is actually the exit
door.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.438
They're just trying to
push me out that way.

13:25.438 --> 13:26.773
(laughing)
(upbeat music)

13:26.773 --> 13:28.541
- Yes, high fashion.

13:28.541 --> 13:29.542
- You're gonna take this.
- Oh, and the crown, okay.

13:29.542 --> 13:30.643
- And you're gonna crown me.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.078
- Oh.
- Yes.

13:32.078 --> 13:33.513
- Do you want me to be snatching
it,

13:33.513 --> 13:34.480
putting it on, crying?

13:34.480 --> 13:36.215
- Give me what you feel
giving up the crown.

13:36.215 --> 13:37.784
- No!

13:37.784 --> 13:41.320
(Priyanka wailing)

13:41.320 --> 13:42.455
Oh hot.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.257
(upbeat music)

13:44.257 --> 13:45.158
Are you a fashion Queen?

13:45.158 --> 13:46.959
- Girl, I made everything I
brought.

13:46.959 --> 13:48.027
- What?
- Yeah.

13:48.027 --> 13:48.861
- Guess what?

13:48.861 --> 13:49.696
I didn't make anything I
brought.

13:49.696 --> 13:53.166
- We could tell.
(laughing)

13:53.166 --> 13:53.999
- Damn.

13:53.999 --> 13:54.834
- This way, yeah yeah.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.904
Well, make it pretty, girl.
(laughing)

13:57.904 --> 14:00.239
Priyanka looks absolutely
beautiful.

14:00.239 --> 14:02.241
I look absolutely beautiful.

14:02.241 --> 14:05.078
Looking beautiful is what we do.

14:05.078 --> 14:07.346
So we're just selling it to the
camera.

14:07.346 --> 14:10.083
(speaking in foreign language)

14:10.083 --> 14:10.917
(laughing)

14:10.917 --> 14:11.751
- What does that mean?

14:11.751 --> 14:12.585
- Do you like my pussy?

14:12.585 --> 14:13.486
- You like my-
(laughing)

14:13.486 --> 14:14.687
Get off, get off.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.456
Bye!
- Okay bye!

14:16.456 --> 14:20.893
- Alright well, that's a
wrap, ladies and gentlemen.

14:20.893 --> 14:22.595
Good luck finding this.

14:22.595 --> 14:26.265
(laughing maniacally)

14:26.265 --> 14:27.100
(engine revving)

14:27.100 --> 14:29.135
- Let's get to rapping, honey.

14:29.135 --> 14:30.136
- Let's get this done.

14:30.136 --> 14:32.371
We get to sing on Brooke Lynn's
single,

14:32.371 --> 14:34.140
"Queen of the North."

14:35.141 --> 14:37.643
We get to write our own verse.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.313
I'm just, I'm excited.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.448
- What are you writing about?

14:42.448 --> 14:43.816
- I think about highlights,

14:43.816 --> 14:46.619
being a fashion girl, winning.

14:46.619 --> 14:49.021
This is your last chance

14:49.021 --> 14:51.090
to show the judges,

14:51.090 --> 14:53.726
show your sisters, show the
world,

14:53.726 --> 14:55.461
why you deserve to be here.

14:55.461 --> 14:56.295
- I'm just gonna make a joke

14:56.295 --> 14:57.497
of some things that have
happened,

14:57.497 --> 14:58.331
I guess.
- Yeah.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.932
- I'll try to work it in there,
and yeah,

14:59.932 --> 15:02.268
just describing myself in a way.

15:02.268 --> 15:04.003
Yeah, what I stand for, kind of.

15:04.003 --> 15:05.772
Clearly I want the win so bad,

15:05.772 --> 15:07.907
but I feel like I really need to
translate

15:07.907 --> 15:10.777
this excitement into my work

15:10.777 --> 15:12.145
in order to take that win.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.880
- Obviously I'm gonna
like, make fun of myself,

15:13.880 --> 15:16.516
'cause that's the best
fucking thing to do.

15:16.516 --> 15:19.519
And then yeah, just serve
that cocky bitch attitude.

15:19.519 --> 15:20.353
- Yeah.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.188
- There's no moment on this show

15:22.188 --> 15:25.191
where more people have
been looking at us three.

15:25.191 --> 15:26.759
So we have to kill this.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.895
Well, the last time I
did a singing challenge,

15:28.895 --> 15:30.830
it didn't go so well for me.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.799
- Yeah we noticed, we noticed.
(laughing)

15:32.799 --> 15:33.666
- Yeah, definitely,

15:33.666 --> 15:36.669
definitely wasn't top
of the charts for me.

15:36.669 --> 15:37.937
So I'm gonna switch it up.
- Not even the bottom

15:37.937 --> 15:40.673
of the charts, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:45.378 --> 15:46.379
- Yay!

15:46.379 --> 15:47.580

So you have to know what you're
doing.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.295
- Oh, fuck.

22:09.295 --> 22:10.129
I thought this was done.

22:10.129 --> 22:11.230
I was like, wow, we did it.

22:11.230 --> 22:12.431
- No, honey.

22:12.431 --> 22:13.999
Forward, up.
- Fuck.

22:14.967 --> 22:17.570
- Back, place, crown, up, down.

22:18.804 --> 22:20.806
She's giving boop.

22:20.806 --> 22:22.241
Versus gung gung.

22:23.108 --> 22:23.943
Yeah?

22:23.943 --> 22:26.111
We want boop.
- Not the gung gung.

22:26.111 --> 22:27.279
- Exactly.
(laughing)

22:27.279 --> 22:29.081
What I want you all to do and
understand

22:29.081 --> 22:31.517
is that your individuality
is what got you here,

22:31.517 --> 22:33.652
and what I'm gonna do is
do the best that I can

22:33.652 --> 22:37.823
to sprinkle as much of
into this as possible.

22:37.823 --> 22:40.559
I know that all of you are
capable

22:40.559 --> 22:42.962
of executing what it
is that we've created.

22:42.962 --> 22:43.896
- 100%.

22:43.896 --> 22:48.534
- But it's going to require
you to show up and do the work.

22:48.534 --> 22:49.969
I wish you all the best.

22:49.969 --> 22:52.538
I think the world is in for a
treat.

22:52.538 --> 22:54.540
Once we get these counts and
these steps

22:54.540 --> 22:55.774
and these hits right.
- And the right legs

22:55.774 --> 22:57.109
to the right places.
- There you go.

22:57.109 --> 22:58.911
Thank you so much.
- Thank you guys.

22:58.911 --> 23:00.045
- Thank you!
- You're welcome!

23:00.045 --> 23:04.316

23:04.316 --> 23:06.952

23:06.952 --> 23:09.989

(laughing)

23:09.989 --> 23:13.993
- It's coronation day!
(laughing)

23:13.993 --> 23:15.628
Oh my god.

23:15.628 --> 23:17.162
Oh my goodness.

23:17.162 --> 23:19.198
Okay ladies, while we get ready.

23:19.198 --> 23:20.032
- Yas.

23:20.032 --> 23:23.569
- Let's talk about our
favorite moments here.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.638
- Aw that's a fun game.
- On Canada's Drag Race.

23:25.638 --> 23:26.472
Yeah.

23:26.472 --> 23:31.243
- For myself, it would be the
comedy challenge, for sure.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.479
That was just like my most fun
experience.

23:33.479 --> 23:34.546
- So the moment you won.

23:34.546 --> 23:37.082
- Yes, well I'm, get ass.
(laughing)

23:37.082 --> 23:38.784
Get ass, yeah.
- Fair though.

23:38.784 --> 23:41.353
- I think I love that like,
look that I was giving,

23:41.353 --> 23:44.423
and I just loved my vibe
and energy, and it was like,

23:44.423 --> 23:46.992
yeah, I felt arrived, if you
will.

23:46.992 --> 23:48.560
- Since we're going with
winnings,

23:48.560 --> 23:50.229
literally just coming out of the
door

23:50.229 --> 23:52.164
with the very first win.
- Yeah.

23:52.164 --> 23:54.099
- And it happened to
be a design challenge.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.401
I'm very grateful.

23:55.401 --> 23:58.771
- My first winning week was very
very,

23:58.771 --> 24:00.739
like, special to me, you know
what I mean?

24:00.739 --> 24:02.608
It was like, musical theater.

24:02.608 --> 24:03.809
I was very much in my element.

24:03.809 --> 24:06.211
My costume for the night was
very iconic,

24:06.211 --> 24:08.514
and I was so proud that
I got to showcase it.

24:08.514 --> 24:10.015
- I think I would say
that that's my favorite

24:10.015 --> 24:11.417
look that I saw.

24:11.417 --> 24:13.352
- Oh my god, thank you.

24:13.352 --> 24:14.520
- What is one thing that you
guys learned

24:14.520 --> 24:16.855
about yourself being here?

24:16.855 --> 24:20.159
- I learned that it's okay to be
myself,

24:21.894 --> 24:25.030
and that people who I
want to have in my life

24:25.030 --> 24:27.866
will understand why I
am the way that I am.

24:27.866 --> 24:30.235
- I think I learned that
I can do so much more

24:30.235 --> 24:32.604
than I can give myself credit
for.

24:32.604 --> 24:35.240
And just being here is a
testament that hey, no, I did
it,

24:35.240 --> 24:36.208
and I can do it,

24:36.208 --> 24:37.543
and I can do way more, probably.

24:37.543 --> 24:38.711
- And you did it well.

24:38.711 --> 24:40.646
- Yeah, thank you.
- Like very well.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.948
- I think for me it's just about

24:42.948 --> 24:45.784
celebrating the flaws within
myself.

24:45.784 --> 24:47.353
My favorite parts about this
experience

24:47.353 --> 24:48.954
was just really realizing that
like,

24:48.954 --> 24:49.988
life is not perfect.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.457
Everything is not perfect.

24:51.457 --> 24:53.092
And that's where you really
settle in

24:53.092 --> 24:55.594
to the most fun experience of
everything.

24:55.594 --> 24:57.696
That's what I'm gonna take away
from this.

24:57.696 --> 24:58.697
- I love us.

24:58.697 --> 24:59.898
- I love us, too.
- Aww, thanks.

24:59.898 --> 25:00.733
- I know.

25:00.733 --> 25:03.168
- Who do we think the
trade of the season was?

25:03.168 --> 25:04.169
(laughing)

25:04.169 --> 25:05.504
- Adriana's really cute.

25:05.504 --> 25:06.739
- I was like, Adriana, yeah.

25:06.739 --> 25:08.440
- I think Adriana's the
trade of the season.

25:08.440 --> 25:11.176
- I don't really look at
any of you guys like that.

25:11.176 --> 25:14.279
If I had to choose, Kendall.

25:14.279 --> 25:16.115
- Oh my!
- Yeah.

25:16.115 --> 25:17.583
Either Kendall or Adriana for
me.

25:17.583 --> 25:20.352
- Not me being the trade of the
season.

25:20.352 --> 25:21.687
(laughing)

25:21.687 --> 25:22.921
Is it all the track suits?

25:22.921 --> 25:24.089
(laughing)

25:24.089 --> 25:25.824

track suit.

26:23.315 --> 26:24.950

26:24.950 --> 26:26.852

26:26.852 --> 26:27.686
- Eyes?

26:27.686 --> 26:29.388
Brooke, my boobs are down here.

26:29.388 --> 26:30.222

trust

record,

own song,

30:46.078 --> 30:47.646
It's just, it's me.

30:48.647 --> 30:51.450
- [Brooke Lynn] And now, Kendall
Gender.

30:51.450 --> 30:53.185
♪ You've got the spotlight ♪

30:53.185 --> 30:54.686
- [Kendall] For the styling of
this look,

30:54.686 --> 30:58.156
it's all about showcasing
the skin that I'm in.

30:58.156 --> 31:00.158
It's elegant, it's edgy.

31:01.026 --> 31:04.730
This is me celebrating a
powerful hourglass shape.

31:04.730 --> 31:08.567
I'm here on this runway to
represent, uplift, and inspire.

31:08.567 --> 31:12.237
This is Kendall Gender, fully
realized.

31:12.237 --> 31:15.640
- [Brooke Lynn] And finally,
Pythia.

31:15.640 --> 31:16.641
- [All] Opa!

31:18.577 --> 31:20.746
- [Pythia] I feel ethereal.

31:20.746 --> 31:23.648
I feel like I have
carved myself from stone.

31:23.648 --> 31:26.918
I look like an ethereal
being from Olympus itself.

31:26.918 --> 31:29.421
It's sort of a testament to
all the work that I have done,

31:29.421 --> 31:32.124
building myself from the way up.

31:32.124 --> 31:35.560
I am glimmering and shining and
flowing.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.329
Look at me! I stand out.

31:37.329 --> 31:39.197
You can't tell me that
you're not staring at me

31:39.197 --> 31:40.532
the entire time.

31:40.532 --> 31:43.168
♪ I just want to light you up ♪

31:43.168 --> 31:44.202
- Welcome back,
(engine revving)

31:44.202 --> 31:47.572
our beautiful, beautiful Queens.

31:47.572 --> 31:51.143
You have all been on quite the
journey.

31:51.143 --> 31:53.845
Yesterday, you all did a photo
shoot,

31:53.845 --> 31:56.281
with season one winner Priyanka.

31:56.281 --> 31:59.618
Icesis Couture, here is your
best photo.

32:00.886 --> 32:02.087
- [Icesis] Wait, hold on.

32:02.087 --> 32:03.822
- Yeah take it off.
- Take it off.

32:03.822 --> 32:06.224
- Yeah, there we go.
- There we go.

32:06.224 --> 32:08.126
- [Icesis] Oh my god, it's
amazing.

32:08.126 --> 32:10.295
- You look absolutely stunning.

32:10.295 --> 32:13.198
What was your journey
from the very beginning

32:13.198 --> 32:15.367
to get to this moment right
here?

32:15.367 --> 32:17.636
- The road to where I am today

32:17.636 --> 32:20.038
definitely has not been easy.

32:21.106 --> 32:22.841
I come from a Hispanic
household,

32:22.841 --> 32:25.544
where me being me was just not
okay.

32:25.544 --> 32:29.781
I come from a household
of physical violence.

32:29.781 --> 32:33.718
I come from a past of
trying to take my own life.

32:33.718 --> 32:36.955
And I came to a point where I
needed

32:36.955 --> 32:39.191
to take control of my own life,

32:39.191 --> 32:41.493
and find something that made me
happy.

32:41.493 --> 32:43.995
And that's something
that I found with drag.

32:43.995 --> 32:46.998
I've spent the last 14 years

32:46.998 --> 32:50.268
sacrificing and trying so hard

32:50.268 --> 32:53.638
to just have a moment like this.

32:53.638 --> 32:56.374
(melancholy music)

32:56.374 --> 32:59.244
And being here and
sharing it with all of you

32:59.244 --> 33:03.048
has literally shown me that it's
okay,

33:03.048 --> 33:04.482
it's okay to be me.

33:04.482 --> 33:06.418
I deserve to be here.

33:06.418 --> 33:08.887
I deserve to be in this place.

33:08.887 --> 33:11.323
Everything that I've been
through

33:11.323 --> 33:13.558
was absolutely worth it.

33:13.558 --> 33:16.895
I could possibly be Canada's
next drag superstar,

33:16.895 --> 33:19.130
and I'm so proud of myself.

33:20.332 --> 33:23.635
And thank you all so
much for believing in me.

33:23.635 --> 33:25.804
(sighing)
(judges laughing)

33:25.804 --> 33:27.706
I did it!
(clapping)

33:27.706 --> 33:29.207
- We are so proud of you.

33:29.207 --> 33:30.642
- Thank you so much.

33:30.642 --> 33:32.043
- Kendall Gender.

33:32.043 --> 33:33.178
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:33.178 --> 33:36.214
Here is your best photo with
Priyanka.

33:36.214 --> 33:38.617
- Oh.
- And you look stunning!

33:39.985 --> 33:40.819
- Oh!

33:40.819 --> 33:43.622
- Tell me about your journey
to get to this point.

33:43.622 --> 33:45.690
- For me, when I was born,

33:45.690 --> 33:47.225
I think as soon as I came out,

33:47.225 --> 33:49.794
I was very flamboyant,
I was very effervescent,

33:49.794 --> 33:51.930
instantly from day one.

33:51.930 --> 33:55.100
And unfortunately, for
me, at a very young age,

33:55.100 --> 33:58.503
I went through some pretty
serious abuse.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.573
And my trajectory from that
abuse

34:01.573 --> 34:06.211
turned into a very serious
problem with drugs and alcohol.

34:06.211 --> 34:09.748
And for me, drugs and alcohol
stole

34:09.748 --> 34:12.484
so many years of my life,

34:12.484 --> 34:15.053
and so many opportunities that I
feel like

34:15.053 --> 34:16.288
I could've had.

34:17.188 --> 34:21.526
The thing that turned my
light back on was drag.

34:21.526 --> 34:24.195
And was getting to express
myself in this art form

34:24.195 --> 34:26.731
and in this community.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.433
It just makes it feel correct,

34:28.433 --> 34:30.168
and I really truly feel like

34:30.168 --> 34:33.438
everything that makes me who I
am,

34:33.438 --> 34:34.839
it puts me on this stage

34:34.839 --> 34:36.708
and it puts me in these
stilettos,

34:36.708 --> 34:40.845
and it puts me in control
of my own destiny.

34:40.845 --> 34:42.747
- I'm like, on the verge of
tears.

34:42.747 --> 34:43.848
- You okay?
(melancholy music)

34:43.848 --> 34:47.052
- When you first came
into the competition,

34:47.052 --> 34:49.154
there was something in you that
I noticed

34:49.154 --> 34:50.522
that you just described.

34:50.522 --> 34:53.925
There was just this innate joy,

34:53.925 --> 34:56.528
and this extreme feeling of you

34:57.996 --> 34:59.564
being so present.

34:59.564 --> 35:00.398
And then-

35:01.366 --> 35:03.601
- It's okay, it's okay.

35:03.601 --> 35:07.238
- When they told me that you
were sober,

35:07.238 --> 35:09.441
that's exactly what I was
responding to,

35:09.441 --> 35:12.477
because I just celebrated 20
years

35:12.477 --> 35:15.447
before we started this journey
together.

35:15.447 --> 35:19.317
And it was so beautiful to me
because

35:19.317 --> 35:22.253
finding out that what I was
responding to

35:22.253 --> 35:24.389
was that light and that joy

35:24.389 --> 35:29.427
that I tried to dampen out
myself as well for many years,

35:29.427 --> 35:33.231
and you are gonna help so many
people.

35:33.231 --> 35:37.035
So, thank you for showing
up every single day.

35:38.803 --> 35:39.804
- Thank you.

35:42.040 --> 35:43.041
- Pythia.

35:43.041 --> 35:45.477
Here is your best picture with
Priyanka.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.545
(laughing)

35:47.545 --> 35:50.148
- It's so cute!
- It's so cute.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.850
Tell me about your journey.

35:51.850 --> 35:54.619
- My journey started in Greece.

35:54.619 --> 35:58.123
I grew up in a very, very, very
religious,

35:58.123 --> 36:00.191
conservative surrounding.

36:01.960 --> 36:05.063
And from the moment that I
was brought into this world,

36:05.063 --> 36:09.701
I had all these expectations
thrusted upon me, in a way.

36:09.701 --> 36:12.270
Walking a certain way,
speaking a certain way,

36:12.270 --> 36:13.605
acting a certain way.

36:13.605 --> 36:17.675
Every single little thing
that I did in my entire life

36:17.675 --> 36:18.877
growing up there,

36:18.877 --> 36:20.278
was deemed wrong.

36:21.112 --> 36:24.783
And I grew up hating
every aspect of myself.

36:27.385 --> 36:29.254
Because when you're so young,

36:29.254 --> 36:30.955
and everybody tells you this is
wrong,

36:30.955 --> 36:32.490
don't do it this way, don't sit
that way,

36:32.490 --> 36:33.691
don't cross your legs that way,

36:33.691 --> 36:35.693
you think that there's
something wrong with you.

36:35.693 --> 36:37.695
I would pray for relief,

36:38.863 --> 36:41.766
or by miracle to be fixed,
somehow.

36:44.102 --> 36:46.371
And I wish I could grab my
younger self

36:46.371 --> 36:47.939
from the shoulders and
shake him and be like,

36:47.939 --> 36:49.674
your prayers are not being
answered

36:49.674 --> 36:53.945
because there's absolutely
nothing wrong with you.

36:53.945 --> 36:55.146
And when I discovered drag,

36:55.146 --> 36:58.383
I literally sculpted myself from
stone.

36:59.851 --> 37:02.720
I realized the strength
that I had inside of me,

37:02.720 --> 37:05.090
all these fantasy worlds
that I created as a child

37:05.090 --> 37:08.026
because I couldn't find the
space for myself in the world,

37:08.026 --> 37:10.728
I found a way to bring it all to
life,

37:10.728 --> 37:13.398
and to apply it, whether
I was in drag or not.

37:13.398 --> 37:15.100
If I hadn't found drag,

37:15.100 --> 37:17.068
I would not be the person that I
am today.

37:17.068 --> 37:19.270
- You are absolutely right,
there's nothing wrong with you.

37:19.270 --> 37:20.105
- Nothing.

37:20.105 --> 37:22.974
- And I think you are
such a phenomenal artist.

37:22.974 --> 37:23.975
- Thank you.

37:25.777 --> 37:29.013
- Well, we have one more
picture.

37:29.013 --> 37:32.083
Bradley, what would you
say to young Alexa Diamond?

37:32.083 --> 37:34.486
- Oh my gosh!
(all laughing)

37:34.486 --> 37:36.554
- No, no!
- Alexa Diamond!

37:37.622 --> 37:39.624
- Alexa!
- Oh my god.

37:39.624 --> 37:41.593
- [Brad] There's a baby drag
Queen.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.194
- [Brooke Lynn] And she is
beautiful.

37:43.194 --> 37:44.863
- [Brad] Oh my god, you guys.

37:44.863 --> 37:47.098
- What would you say to her,
Brad?

37:47.098 --> 37:49.033
- Listen, babe.
(laughing)

37:49.033 --> 37:50.802
I would say,

37:50.802 --> 37:54.873
I would say smooth out
your boobs a little bit.

37:54.873 --> 37:57.075
One day you'll be wearing real
Versace,

37:57.075 --> 37:59.477
not a knockoff.
(laughing)

37:59.477 --> 38:01.012
You know, she tried it.

38:01.012 --> 38:02.313
She really tried it.

38:02.313 --> 38:04.649
I love her.
- I love her too.

38:04.649 --> 38:05.850
Queens,
(dramatic music)

38:05.850 --> 38:08.486
it is now time for your final
critique.

38:08.486 --> 38:09.320
- Oh yay!

38:11.022 --> 38:13.091
- [Brooke Lynn] Starting
with Icesis Couture.

38:13.091 --> 38:15.426
- Well, Icesis Couture.

38:15.426 --> 38:18.863
You came out today a full-on
power house.

38:21.232 --> 38:23.768
- Yay!
- From beginning to end,

38:23.768 --> 38:26.171
you nailed every single beat.

38:26.171 --> 38:27.705
I just couldn't take my eyes off
of you.

38:27.705 --> 38:30.708
You looked like you were
having a great time.

38:30.708 --> 38:31.943
- Even when it wasn't your
verse,

38:31.943 --> 38:33.144
and you were walking across the
stage,

38:33.144 --> 38:34.779
or you were over in the corner,

38:34.779 --> 38:37.982
it was full 100 the entire time.

38:37.982 --> 38:40.385
- This look is incredible.

38:40.385 --> 38:43.388
It's thoughtful and weird and
unique

38:43.388 --> 38:46.057
and sexy at the same time, which
is you.

38:46.057 --> 38:49.594
- From your head piece down
to your feathers on the trim,

38:49.594 --> 38:50.428
it's just gorgeous.

38:50.428 --> 38:53.398
It's couture, it looks
expensive, it looks lavish,

38:53.398 --> 38:55.567
it looks like Icesis Couture.

38:55.567 --> 38:57.502
- I love that each week you come
out

38:57.502 --> 38:59.070
in something different,

38:59.070 --> 39:00.438
and you kind of run the gamut.

39:00.438 --> 39:02.106
You do beauty, you do glamor,

39:02.106 --> 39:04.509
and then you come out in this
really crazy

39:04.509 --> 39:06.578
alien wedding dress moment,

39:06.578 --> 39:08.246
and it's incredible.

39:08.246 --> 39:09.847
And I loved your mouth piece.

39:09.847 --> 39:13.585
Your mouth was gaping,
our mouths were dropped.

39:13.585 --> 39:16.487
- When you spoke tonight
about your childhood,

39:16.487 --> 39:18.323
and you spoke about being
other-ed,

39:18.323 --> 39:22.493
and being a child whose
home was full of violence,

39:24.162 --> 39:25.763
I can relate to that.

39:25.763 --> 39:28.066
And I know what that does to a
person.

39:28.066 --> 39:30.335
You put up a shell,

39:30.335 --> 39:34.138
and you start second guessing
yourself,

39:34.138 --> 39:36.107
and you could wither away,

39:36.107 --> 39:38.176
or you could be Icesis Couture,

39:38.176 --> 39:39.344
or Traci Melchor,

39:39.344 --> 39:42.413
and be bigger, and shine, and
dazzle.

39:42.413 --> 39:43.982
And that is what you have done.

39:43.982 --> 39:45.350
You've taken pain,

39:45.350 --> 39:48.119
and you've made it into Icesis
Couture

39:48.119 --> 39:50.455
that we see standing in front of
us today.

39:50.455 --> 39:52.490
Thank you for sharing your
journey,

39:52.490 --> 39:53.992
the good and the bad,

39:53.992 --> 39:56.127
because you've helped so many
people

39:56.127 --> 39:58.263
who are struggling right now,

39:58.263 --> 40:01.766
and are feeling very
hopeless and maybe worthless,

40:01.766 --> 40:04.035
and maybe feeling like they
don't count.

40:04.035 --> 40:07.205
And you have made them feel
seen.

40:07.205 --> 40:09.707
- You're all getting me.

40:09.707 --> 40:13.645
- This is just the beginning
of the Icesis Couture party.

40:13.645 --> 40:15.847
And I want to be on the VIP list
for it.

40:15.847 --> 40:16.648
(all laughing)

40:16.648 --> 40:18.049
- I'll give you free tickets, I
promise.

40:18.049 --> 40:19.150
(all laughing)

40:19.150 --> 40:20.985
(upbeat music)

40:20.985 --> 40:22.387
- [Brooke Lynn] Kendall Gender.

40:22.387 --> 40:23.221
- Hi.

40:23.221 --> 40:28.192
- Your verse, fire, hot, H-O-T,
H-A-W-T,

40:28.660 --> 40:30.528
exclamation point, exclamation
point.

40:30.528 --> 40:32.964
You came out like the West
Coast diva that you are.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.299
Mic drop moment.

40:34.299 --> 40:36.801
You really owned that stage.

40:36.801 --> 40:40.872
You have this Beyonce
superstar energy about you.

40:42.173 --> 40:45.076
- I realize it was a trio,
and everyone was fantastic,

40:45.076 --> 40:48.746
but you, my darling, were
the lead of the performance.

40:48.746 --> 40:50.315
I couldn't take my eyes off of
you.

40:50.315 --> 40:53.117
It was just, just powerful.

40:53.117 --> 40:54.752
- You also nailed the choreo.

40:54.752 --> 40:56.254
Which is not easy to do,

40:56.254 --> 40:58.256
'cause I know Hollywood Jade.
(laughing)

40:58.256 --> 41:01.592
He likes to try it with you.
- Yeah.

41:01.592 --> 41:03.328
- Your look tonight is
beautiful.

41:03.328 --> 41:05.463
I'm so happy to see you in a
gown.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.065
I love all the crystals.

41:07.065 --> 41:09.634
You just look stunning.

41:09.634 --> 41:11.469
- I think this is a really
special look,

41:11.469 --> 41:13.404
because I understand it now.

41:13.404 --> 41:15.006
It was the last design
challenge,

41:15.006 --> 41:16.507
and you explained to us,

41:16.507 --> 41:18.509
you did this over-exaggerated
hip thing.

41:18.509 --> 41:20.678
- It's always something that
I try to do within my drag

41:20.678 --> 41:22.480
is bring my culture and my
heritage,

41:22.480 --> 41:23.848
and really what I believe in.

41:23.848 --> 41:25.383
Also, the hair,

41:25.383 --> 41:26.551
because traditionally,

41:26.551 --> 41:28.419
these kind of styles are not
presented

41:28.419 --> 41:29.854
in a glamorous way,

41:29.854 --> 41:31.723
and we have so many issues with
it

41:31.723 --> 41:33.758
throughout our community
and throughout the world,

41:33.758 --> 41:37.595
so I wanted to stand here
in my full realization,

41:37.595 --> 41:39.430
and show you that this is
beautiful,

41:39.430 --> 41:40.932
my heritage is beautiful,

41:40.932 --> 41:44.602
and what I represent, I believe
in.

41:44.602 --> 41:47.004
- You have an "it" factor about
you

41:47.004 --> 41:48.506
that can't be fabricated,

41:48.506 --> 41:51.309
and it's extraordinary to watch.

41:51.309 --> 41:53.344
It can't be diminished, so
again,

41:53.344 --> 41:54.779
I want you to just keep growing

41:54.779 --> 41:57.081
and keep loving yourself,
because you are worthy,

41:57.081 --> 41:58.082
you're extraordinary,

41:58.082 --> 42:00.351
and the world deserves to see
your light.

42:00.351 --> 42:02.520
- That joy that you know you
have,

42:02.520 --> 42:05.390
you share with the people that
are in your space as well,

42:05.390 --> 42:06.557
whether it's in the Werk Room,

42:06.557 --> 42:08.793
or whether it's us watching you.

42:08.793 --> 42:10.328
And thank you for that.

42:10.328 --> 42:13.564
It came across so hard tonight,

42:13.564 --> 42:15.933
with all of your drops and your
splits,

42:15.933 --> 42:17.568
and you were just like in it,

42:17.568 --> 42:19.404
and looked like you were
having the best time.

42:19.404 --> 42:20.671
- Thank you so much.

42:20.671 --> 42:22.106
I love you.

42:22.106 --> 42:24.175
- Last but certainly not least,

42:24.175 --> 42:25.676
we have Pythia.

42:25.676 --> 42:27.812
I mean, come the fuck on.

42:27.812 --> 42:28.946
Like-
(laughing)

42:28.946 --> 42:32.283
- You have just upped the bar so
high,

42:32.283 --> 42:34.452
and this runway tonight,

42:34.452 --> 42:37.054
it is breathtakingly beautiful.

42:37.955 --> 42:40.691
It is a perfect way to pay
homage

42:41.726 --> 42:43.060
to your culture.

42:44.362 --> 42:46.931
And the clever details,

42:46.931 --> 42:49.200
like the rolls as a peplum,

42:50.134 --> 42:51.836
that stoning is just beautiful.

42:51.836 --> 42:53.538
Your hair and makeup.

42:53.538 --> 42:54.939
You're a vision.

42:54.939 --> 42:57.775
- Your talent is endless.

42:57.775 --> 42:59.844
And today, you smashed it.

42:59.844 --> 43:00.778
- Thank you.

43:00.778 --> 43:02.246
- You did a fantastic job.

43:02.246 --> 43:05.516
It was totally in your
lane and in your fashion.

43:05.516 --> 43:07.351
It was quirky, it was so good,

43:07.351 --> 43:09.353
and you were so committed and
fearless.

43:09.353 --> 43:10.488
- I love when you said that

43:10.488 --> 43:13.791
you've taken some of the
fantasy from your youth,

43:13.791 --> 43:16.761
and you've parlayed it
into these incredible looks

43:16.761 --> 43:18.863
that we've seen every week.

43:18.863 --> 43:20.398
You know, sometimes we say, you
know,

43:20.398 --> 43:22.366
stay in your lane, or
people have their lane.

43:22.366 --> 43:24.802
You've built a whole highway.

43:24.802 --> 43:26.137
Like, you really have.
(laughing)

43:26.137 --> 43:30.107
You've really built your
own Pythia universe,

43:30.107 --> 43:32.310
and we love to live in it.

43:32.310 --> 43:35.346
- I think you have such
integrity in your drag.

43:35.346 --> 43:38.015
There is no stone left unturned
with you.

43:38.015 --> 43:40.451
There's nothing that has
not been thought about,

43:40.451 --> 43:43.754
and I love how you also shape
shift from week to week,

43:43.754 --> 43:46.324
and we get to see all these
different sides of you.

43:46.324 --> 43:50.161
And you really represent for
the non-binary community.

43:50.161 --> 43:52.930
- Do not let anybody ever

43:52.930 --> 43:55.766
try to change who you are,

43:55.766 --> 43:58.336
what you stand for, who you
represent,

43:58.336 --> 44:01.205
because it is so fantastically
wonderful.

44:01.205 --> 44:03.875
Thank you so much for
everything that you brought.

44:03.875 --> 44:04.876
- Thank you.

44:04.876 --> 44:06.277
- Thank you, Queens.

44:06.277 --> 44:07.979
While you untuck in the Werk
Room,

44:07.979 --> 44:09.947
the judges will deliberate.

44:09.947 --> 44:13.484
You may leave the stage.
(engines revving)

44:13.484 --> 44:14.852
(upbeat music)

44:14.852 --> 44:16.287
- Oh my god.
- Oh.

44:18.422 --> 44:19.857
How bittersweet is this?

44:19.857 --> 44:21.058
- I know.
- Yeah.

44:21.058 --> 44:22.627
- The best thing about this top
three

44:22.627 --> 44:24.695
is that we are actually all so
close.

44:24.695 --> 44:26.864
Like, I love them so much.

44:27.899 --> 44:29.433
But that doesn't necessarily
mean

44:29.433 --> 44:32.236
that I don't want this for
myself.

44:32.236 --> 44:33.938
I also love myself a lot,

44:33.938 --> 44:36.908
and I feel very deserving of
this title.

44:36.908 --> 44:40.044
Our lives are gonna change so
much.

44:40.044 --> 44:42.380
Like, if we win this crown.

44:42.380 --> 44:45.483
Like, it's so crazy to think
that.

44:45.483 --> 44:47.485
- I never practice an exit line.

44:47.485 --> 44:49.620
I never practice an exit speech.

44:49.620 --> 44:52.790
And I never practice a lip
sync letter on the mirror.

44:52.790 --> 44:54.191
I never wanted to visualize
myself

44:54.191 --> 44:55.393
anywhere but the top.

44:55.393 --> 44:58.229
The crown is gonna give
us a whole new platform

44:58.229 --> 45:00.331
to do what we love.

45:00.331 --> 45:01.699
- When I walked into this
competition,

45:01.699 --> 45:05.269
I thought it was going to be
a very different experience,

45:05.269 --> 45:08.539
but I have been broken down and
remolded

45:08.539 --> 45:10.908
into the best version of myself.

45:10.908 --> 45:14.145
Now I truly believe in myself,

45:14.145 --> 45:17.815
and I believe in my
skillset like never before.

45:17.815 --> 45:20.051
- It's crazy that we are top
three.

45:20.051 --> 45:23.454
The things that would
change with the crown,

45:23.454 --> 45:26.257
just could change absolutely
everything.

45:26.257 --> 45:27.725
- Totally.
- It's a once in a lifetime.

45:27.725 --> 45:29.460
You will never get this
opportunity again.

45:29.460 --> 45:31.028
- I want to make a difference.

45:31.028 --> 45:32.797
I want to bring beauty to the
world.

45:32.797 --> 45:35.733
I want to spread a message of
love,

45:36.567 --> 45:38.035
and just like, acceptance,

45:38.035 --> 45:40.304
while just looking so good.

45:41.372 --> 45:42.573
- I'm so proud of all of you.

45:42.573 --> 45:44.241
- I am so proud of us.
- I am so proud

45:44.241 --> 45:46.177
of you guys too, yes.
- Oh my gosh.

45:46.177 --> 45:47.578
- I'm gonna miss you guys.

45:47.578 --> 45:49.780
- Yeah.
- Like, I really am.

45:49.780 --> 45:52.550
And I finally found
people that I don't mind.

45:52.550 --> 45:53.551
(laughing)

45:53.551 --> 45:55.152
So this has been great for me.
- We don't mind you either.

45:55.152 --> 45:57.021
- Not you not minding us.

45:57.021 --> 45:59.056
(laughing)
(engine revving)

45:59.056 --> 46:01.525
- Well, now to pick a winner.

46:01.525 --> 46:03.828
We have quite the decision to
make.

46:03.828 --> 46:05.796
Let's start with Icesis Couture.

46:05.796 --> 46:07.898
- She won the first fashion
challenge,

46:07.898 --> 46:12.003
and she has continued
to, every single week,

46:12.003 --> 46:14.038
give us so much variety.

46:14.038 --> 46:15.806
You know, you never know what
you're gonna get with her,

46:15.806 --> 46:18.542
but you always know it's
going to be elevated,

46:18.542 --> 46:19.910
it's going to be fashion,

46:19.910 --> 46:21.646
and it's gonna be Couture.

46:21.646 --> 46:25.249
- She is a fantastic all-around
Queen,

46:25.249 --> 46:28.019
and I think that's really
hard to compete with

46:28.019 --> 46:29.787
when she's that good at
everything.

46:29.787 --> 46:31.989
- And she's also really
malleable,

46:31.989 --> 46:34.859
and we've seen this evolution of
her

46:34.859 --> 46:37.662
from being a lone wolf, kind of
quiet,

46:37.662 --> 46:39.363
to finding her voice,

46:39.363 --> 46:41.499
and really stepping into the
spotlight.

46:41.499 --> 46:44.001
- Can we talk about her
in this final challenge?

46:44.001 --> 46:46.904
Ooh, like she just came
out guns a-blazin',

46:46.904 --> 46:49.140
from like, the start.

46:49.140 --> 46:51.075
And I really could not
take my eyes off her

46:51.075 --> 46:52.043
the whole performance.

46:52.043 --> 46:53.744
- She really has the whole
package.

46:53.744 --> 46:56.180
- Up next, Kendall Gender.

46:56.180 --> 46:57.848
She has really proven herself

46:57.848 --> 46:59.316
that she deserves to be here.

46:59.316 --> 47:00.484
- It was a slow burn,

47:00.484 --> 47:01.652
there were peaks and valleys,

47:01.652 --> 47:04.388
but she literally was
like a rocket to stardom

47:04.388 --> 47:06.090
at the right time.

47:06.090 --> 47:08.092
She showed up, she listened,

47:08.092 --> 47:11.262
she always put her best
foot forward no matter what,

47:11.262 --> 47:14.598
and that type of mentality
will get you very very far.

47:14.598 --> 47:15.833
- Very far.

47:15.833 --> 47:18.369
She's had some really great
moments in this competition.

47:18.369 --> 47:20.304
Her performance in the
Rusical was amazing.

47:20.304 --> 47:21.872
- Great.
- And then her roast of me.

47:21.872 --> 47:23.574
- Fantastic.
- So good.

47:23.574 --> 47:25.242
- I mean, I cried all the way
home.

47:25.242 --> 47:26.077
(laughing)

47:26.077 --> 47:27.478
- And I know we got on her

47:27.478 --> 47:28.512
for all of the body suits,

47:28.512 --> 47:30.347
but damn, girl can rock a body
suit.

47:30.347 --> 47:31.482
- She can rock a body suit.

47:31.482 --> 47:32.883
- I like the body suits.

47:32.883 --> 47:34.518
And a body suit also highlighted

47:34.518 --> 47:36.253
that incredible silhouette.

47:36.253 --> 47:39.190
I love she talked about
the Black women's physique,

47:39.190 --> 47:40.891
and you know, the snatched
waist,

47:40.891 --> 47:42.093
and the bigger hips.

47:42.093 --> 47:45.596
And nod to culture with the
Bantu knots and the braids.

47:45.596 --> 47:47.331
Because she's right, you know.

47:47.331 --> 47:49.166
There's been a lot of thievery

47:49.166 --> 47:50.901
of Black women's aesthetics.

47:50.901 --> 47:54.038
You see it on other people
and not being attributed.

47:54.038 --> 47:55.973
And I love the fact that she's
bringing

47:55.973 --> 47:58.876
that type of message
to Canada's Drag Race.

47:58.876 --> 48:00.377
- Up next, Pythia.

48:01.479 --> 48:03.280
- Our Grecian goddess.

48:04.181 --> 48:07.318
She is the quiet storm, you
know.

48:07.318 --> 48:09.587
You never know what to expect
from Pythia.

48:09.587 --> 48:10.488
- Week after week,

48:10.488 --> 48:12.757
I was always the most excited to
see her

48:12.757 --> 48:14.525
turn the corner on the runway.

48:14.525 --> 48:16.494
'Cause I just never knew
what I was gonna get,

48:16.494 --> 48:20.431
but I knew that it was just
gonna be flawlessly executed.

48:20.431 --> 48:23.267
- Pythia has been so consistent

48:23.267 --> 48:25.436
throughout this competition week
to week,

48:25.436 --> 48:30.107
and the ability to be able
to create things in your mind

48:31.008 --> 48:33.310
and stories in your mind
and concepts in your mind,

48:33.310 --> 48:35.646
and then execute them
flawlessly,

48:35.646 --> 48:38.682
and then perform them,
wear them and perform them,

48:38.682 --> 48:40.184
is so exceptional.

48:41.085 --> 48:43.988
Like, her artistry is above and
beyond

48:43.988 --> 48:45.222
anything I've ever seen.

48:45.222 --> 48:46.824
And tonight's look,

48:46.824 --> 48:49.059
my breath is still taken away.

48:49.059 --> 48:51.562
- Can we talk about that verse?

48:51.562 --> 48:52.396
- Smart.

48:52.396 --> 48:54.231
- Anybody that can put Grecian
goddess,

48:54.231 --> 48:57.168
abra cadabra, and witch in a
verse,

48:57.168 --> 48:58.903
and make it sing?

48:58.903 --> 49:00.104
Drop the mic.
- Yeah, yeah.

49:00.104 --> 49:01.005
- Works for me.

49:01.005 --> 49:03.674
- Pythia in performance is
great,

49:03.674 --> 49:06.277
which again, is her ability to
kind of

49:06.277 --> 49:08.279
funnel who Pythia is

49:08.279 --> 49:10.114
into whatever she's doing.

49:10.114 --> 49:12.383
- I love that she takes
up for the queer community

49:12.383 --> 49:14.485
and the non-binary community so
hard,

49:14.485 --> 49:16.854
and she's so proud to represent
them.

49:16.854 --> 49:19.790
And I think that is so
beautiful and powerful.

49:19.790 --> 49:23.294
- She, to me, is just the new
frontier.

49:23.294 --> 49:24.762
