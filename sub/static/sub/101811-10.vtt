00:09.139 --> 00:10.445
Hey, what do we got?

00:10.488 --> 00:13.013
Homicide. Girl's name
was Andrea Davis.

00:13.056 --> 00:15.189
She was found dead
this morning.

00:16.538 --> 00:19.149
Ligature marks on her neck,
looks like she was strangled.

00:20.542 --> 00:21.717
Who found her?

00:21.760 --> 00:22.979
The young lady
in the adjoining room.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.502
She knew her.

00:24.546 --> 00:26.504
Well, let's see
who else know her.

DANNY:
Megan?

00:32.902 --> 00:35.774
Detective Reagan,
my partner Detective Baez.

00:35.818 --> 00:38.647
I can't believe this.

00:38.690 --> 00:41.998
You in town for the
Comic-Con or something?

00:42.042 --> 00:45.088
Yeah, we were, um, in town
for a video game tournament,

00:45.132 --> 00:47.438
and they put everybody up
at the hotel.

00:47.482 --> 00:49.005
I'm confused.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.138
You're here to watch
video games?

00:51.181 --> 00:53.879
No, to compete in them.

00:53.923 --> 00:55.577
FYI, Andrea is one

00:55.620 --> 00:58.145
of the most famous video game
streamers in the world.

00:58.188 --> 01:00.538
Famous?
Can you believe that?

01:00.582 --> 01:03.411
Yeah, actually,
my son's a fan of gamers.

01:03.454 --> 01:05.456
Now that you mention it,
uh...

01:05.500 --> 01:07.067
they make more money,
according to him.

01:07.110 --> 01:08.894
Especially Andrea.

01:08.938 --> 01:10.896
She had millions of followers.

01:10.940 --> 01:12.855
So you're
a professional gamer, too?

01:12.898 --> 01:14.683
I'm no Andrea, but yes.

01:14.726 --> 01:17.599
And we stuck together.

01:17.642 --> 01:19.209
Why is that?

01:19.253 --> 01:21.342
Because of the men in our world.

01:21.385 --> 01:24.388
No offense to your son,
I'm sure he's...

01:24.432 --> 01:26.086
a nice guy, but...

01:26.129 --> 01:28.305
for every fan
that sends us a gift,

01:28.349 --> 01:31.221
there are a hundred others
that are just...

01:31.265 --> 01:32.875
creeps.

01:32.918 --> 01:35.660
The pictures that they send us?

01:35.704 --> 01:38.054
The threats they make?

01:38.098 --> 01:39.621
"Threats"?

01:39.664 --> 01:40.796
Anyone ever threaten Andrea?

01:40.839 --> 01:43.103

02:00.816 --> 02:03.906
[laughs] That's game!

02:03.949 --> 02:05.690
I don't think my knees
are what they used to be.

02:05.734 --> 02:08.128
[laughs] Come on, man,
you're not even that old.

02:08.171 --> 02:10.130
I can't believe
I even did this, man.

02:10.173 --> 02:12.175
What, signed up
for a mentorship program?

02:12.219 --> 02:14.482
Run by law enforcement.

02:14.525 --> 02:16.440
You should be proud
of your choices Deon.

Come on, last game--
let's play to ten.

Is that Deon Williams?

Man, did you have
to wear that shirt?

02:27.582 --> 02:29.192
Who are these guys?

02:29.236 --> 02:30.715
You guys believe this?
[chuckles]

02:30.759 --> 02:33.022
Even for you,
this is next level.

02:33.065 --> 02:34.937
Yo, whatever Reggie.You gonna apply

02:34.980 --> 02:35.981
to the police academy, too?

02:37.244 --> 02:39.550
Hey... take it easy.

02:39.594 --> 02:42.205
Run along now, piggy.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.990
Let's just get out of here, man.

02:46.383 --> 02:48.951
Okay.

02:48.994 --> 02:50.909
REGGIE:
That's what I thought.

02:51.954 --> 02:54.696
Pension protections for cops
with 20 years on the job

02:54.739 --> 02:56.437
has been a home run.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.090
From a cop's perspective, sure.

02:58.134 --> 03:00.136
Well, that's the perspective
we generally have up here,

03:00.180 --> 03:01.833
in case you hadn't noticed.

03:01.877 --> 03:04.227
What the governor's
pushing-- one slip up

03:04.271 --> 03:06.664
and a vested cop loses
their whole pension

03:06.708 --> 03:07.839
and poof, there
goes retirement.

03:07.883 --> 03:10.842
I've got nothing
for that perspective.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.888
I'm listening.

03:14.324 --> 03:15.891
I don't have a dog in the hunt.

03:15.934 --> 03:18.937
I'm just trying to formulate
this department's response.

03:18.981 --> 03:20.983
Nah, you always got to play
the devil's advocate.

03:21.026 --> 03:22.898
Take the day
off for once.

03:22.941 --> 03:24.943
And it's not right
that a cop who's on the take,

03:24.987 --> 03:27.076
or perjures himself at trial
and gets the boot,

03:27.119 --> 03:29.034
still walks away
with his full pension.

03:29.078 --> 03:32.124
That's a few bad apples,
few and far between.

03:32.168 --> 03:34.257
More and closer together.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.911
I'm listening.

03:35.954 --> 03:38.435
And defending this policy
laughs in the face

03:38.479 --> 03:40.437
of all the reform flags
we're raising.

03:40.481 --> 03:43.310
No, it's us raising a flag
saying we're not gonna

03:43.353 --> 03:45.964
tear every single protection
the cops have

03:46.008 --> 03:47.966
to mollify the
city council.

03:48.010 --> 03:49.881
And all five
district attorneys.

03:49.925 --> 03:51.927
And the Yankees,
Giants, Knicks

03:51.970 --> 03:53.885
and Rangers, for all I care.

03:53.929 --> 03:55.974
I say we stand fast.

03:57.976 --> 04:00.544
Our best defense is sitting
across from us.

04:00.588 --> 04:02.372
You said the PC pushed
these protections through

04:02.416 --> 04:03.852
when he took office?

04:03.895 --> 04:06.028
Well, he's still more
admired and trusted

04:06.071 --> 04:07.812
than all of them
put together.

04:07.856 --> 04:10.250
Well, more than
the Knicks maybe.

04:11.468 --> 04:14.079
I say what he says goes.

at the time, that morale

04:22.174 --> 04:24.176
was so low
when the PC took over

that he supported the bill
just as an "attaboy."

Easy there, Garrett.

04:28.137 --> 04:29.704
Yeah, come on,
that doesn't sound like him.

That he saw
all the traps and threw

04:31.009 --> 04:32.010
his weight
behind it anyway.

04:32.054 --> 04:33.838
And they got it wrong.

And please
do not promote hearsay

about the Dead Twins,

of the Dead Twins?

Same guys who robbed
that bodega last week?

I don't think
it's the same guys, but...

08:32.947 --> 08:34.252
Yeah, but they're affiliated?

They beat that bodega owner
within an inch of his life.

Can we just play?

and kill somebody next time?

Do you want to stay silent
and let that happen?

I guess I can ask around.

No, I don't want you
to ask around.

21:18.146 --> 21:20.366
You want to take one,

21:20.409 --> 21:23.717
turn back,
I'm good with that.

21:25.196 --> 21:26.981
I'll talk to you.

21:34.075 --> 21:36.077
[sighs]

21:37.296 --> 21:39.080
[mutters softly]

21:40.124 --> 21:41.474
The common good?

21:41.517 --> 21:43.127
Yes.

21:43.171 --> 21:44.346
That's a good one.

21:44.390 --> 21:46.174
It's not a joke.

21:46.217 --> 21:47.915
The commissioner feels,
as you do,

21:47.958 --> 21:51.875
that the current laws protecting
cops' pensions goes too far.

21:51.919 --> 21:54.965
Which is setting all kinds
of alarms in my head.

21:55.009 --> 21:56.967
No one is above the law.

21:57.011 --> 21:58.404
If my father had a tattoo,

21:58.447 --> 22:00.188
that's exactly
what it would say.

22:00.231 --> 22:02.146
Uh-huh.

22:02.190 --> 22:06.760
And when a veteran cop
can break the law

22:06.803 --> 22:10.024
knowing he will still walk away
with his hundred K pension,

22:10.067 --> 22:12.200
well, that's wrong.

22:12.243 --> 22:13.636
Oh, I know that.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.508
I'm just surprised
to hear you peddling

22:15.551 --> 22:17.553
that your old man agrees.

22:17.597 --> 22:19.381
I am not peddling anything.

22:19.425 --> 22:20.904
I'm sharing information

22:20.948 --> 22:24.212
that he wants you,
and you alone, to have.

22:24.255 --> 22:26.301
Well, you and me, alone.

22:28.259 --> 22:30.958
What does he want me
to do with it?

22:31.001 --> 22:33.961
Ignore whatever comes out of
One PP in regards to this bill.

22:34.004 --> 22:35.702
That I'm a
"defund the police" guy.

22:35.745 --> 22:37.138
Another radical lefty

22:37.181 --> 22:39.096
from the "blue lives
don't matter" crowd.

22:39.140 --> 22:42.883
I have no idea what the return
fire is going to sound like.

22:42.926 --> 22:44.667
I do.

22:44.711 --> 22:46.887
I've been on the receiving end
of it before.

22:46.930 --> 22:49.019
You have ignored it before.

22:49.063 --> 22:50.543
Ignore it again.

22:50.586 --> 22:54.068
Your old man is well-respected
way beyond city limits.

22:54.111 --> 22:55.722
Giving him short shrift

22:55.765 --> 23:00.291
always costs me something and
never gained me a single vote.

23:00.335 --> 23:02.946
I am sure he will owe you one.

23:04.121 --> 23:05.296
Did he say that?

23:06.385 --> 23:08.865
No. I said that.

23:08.909 --> 23:10.563
Are you wearing a wire?

23:10.606 --> 23:12.347
Are you kidding me?

23:12.391 --> 23:14.001
Half kidding.

23:16.612 --> 23:18.658
It really is
for the common good.

23:18.701 --> 23:20.964
Thank you for your time.

23:22.444 --> 23:23.663
Aren't you forgetting something?

23:24.838 --> 23:25.882
What?

23:25.926 --> 23:27.710
"We never had
this conversation"?

23:27.754 --> 23:29.886
That goes without saying.

23:29.930 --> 23:32.759
Tell him to expect a final draft
of the bill in the morning.

23:32.802 --> 23:34.935
He should know exactly

23:34.978 --> 23:38.199
what he's fake fighting
against, right?

23:42.159 --> 23:44.988
[door opens, closes]

23:48.035 --> 23:50.037
[indistinct chatter]

23:51.386 --> 23:53.736
Hey. Got the time?

23:53.780 --> 23:56.696
Wait, you're that cop
from the center, aren't you?

23:56.739 --> 23:59.612
You're Reggie,
member of the Dead Twins?

23:59.655 --> 24:00.656
Deon sent you?

24:00.700 --> 24:02.571
No. He doesn't know I'm here.

24:02.615 --> 24:04.181
You guys believe this?

24:04.225 --> 24:06.880
Of all the people
to get mixed up with a cop.

24:06.923 --> 24:08.621
Blood turning against blood.

24:08.664 --> 24:10.144
It's not right.

24:10.187 --> 24:12.799
What's that mean?
Blood turning against blood?

24:12.842 --> 24:16.367
Look, whatever happened
with Deon

24:16.411 --> 24:17.847
had nothing to do with us.

24:17.891 --> 24:19.501
Now, we're just minding
our own business.

24:19.545 --> 24:21.024
Why don't you do the same?

24:21.068 --> 24:23.723
Looks like you've got
Deon's watch, too.

24:23.766 --> 24:25.681
Was a gift.

24:25.725 --> 24:27.466
It's criminal possession
of stolen property.

24:27.509 --> 24:28.684
Wasn't me who stole it.

24:28.728 --> 24:30.599
You know what?

24:30.643 --> 24:34.385
Fine. Take it.

24:34.429 --> 24:35.865
Felt weird having it anyway.

24:35.909 --> 24:37.998
Who gave it to you?

24:38.041 --> 24:40.653
You got his watch back, man.
That's all you're getting.

24:40.696 --> 24:42.263
No, not unless you don't want
a ride to the station.

24:42.306 --> 24:43.656
Tell me what I
want to know,

24:43.699 --> 24:44.831
or you're going in cuffs.

24:44.874 --> 24:46.485
It's your call.

24:51.098 --> 24:54.493
These messages Andrea
received are just horrible.

24:54.536 --> 24:55.842
The worst of them
coming from this guy

24:55.885 --> 24:58.235
going by the name
ShowStunner.

24:58.279 --> 24:59.628
Ralph's handle.

24:59.672 --> 25:01.804
Sean was right,
he's a total prick.

25:01.848 --> 25:03.719
Yeah.That said, it's
been months

25:03.763 --> 25:05.547
since he last messaged her.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.636
Doesn't mean he wasn't
still holding a grudge.

25:07.680 --> 25:10.683
True, but could be time
we look elsewhere.

25:10.726 --> 25:13.294
I think I figured out
where elsewhere is.

25:13.337 --> 25:15.339
What is it?Come see.

25:17.211 --> 25:19.213
The cameras outside of
Andrea's door weren't working,

25:19.256 --> 25:22.259
but this is footage
from the hotel bar.

25:23.304 --> 25:24.697
That's Ralph.

25:24.740 --> 25:26.786
BAEZ:
Guess he wasn't as busy

25:26.829 --> 25:28.701
as he said he was.Right. And that's Megan Mills.

25:31.878 --> 25:33.923
For a second there, it
looks just like Andrea.

25:33.967 --> 25:36.186
Yeah. Same height,
same pink hair.

25:36.230 --> 25:38.188
And they had
adjoining hotel rooms.

25:40.626 --> 25:43.193
Do you think he made a mistake
and went after the wrong girl?

25:43.237 --> 25:44.412
Think we might have
been looking

25:44.455 --> 25:46.457
at the wrong mark
the whole time.

25:56.250 --> 25:58.339
[door opens]

26:11.700 --> 26:13.746
That bad, huh?

26:14.834 --> 26:18.011
If this new draft
was a gesture...

26:18.054 --> 26:19.273
that'd be it.

26:20.491 --> 26:22.276
Walk me through it.
I got to think.

26:22.319 --> 26:24.887
Our amendment calls for
a case-by-case review

26:24.931 --> 26:26.410
of cops' infractions.

26:26.454 --> 26:28.761
Well, that's what we needed.
This isn't that?

26:28.804 --> 26:31.764
No. This is wholesale.

26:31.807 --> 26:35.985
Means any infraction
requires complete forfeiture

26:36.029 --> 26:37.421
of a cop's pension.

26:37.465 --> 26:39.815
So a questionable couple
of minutes of phone video

26:39.859 --> 26:42.905
carries the same penalty
as shaking down a drug lord.

26:44.690 --> 26:45.821
Son of a bitch.

26:45.865 --> 26:47.301
You bowed your head.

26:47.344 --> 26:49.999
He wants to see if you'll
genuflect and kiss the ring.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.742
You have pushed back pretty
hard on his rhetoric last year.

26:53.786 --> 26:55.004
You can see why it backfired.

26:55.048 --> 26:56.658
Well, that's what I do
when someone

26:56.702 --> 26:58.965
calls my cops racist.

26:59.008 --> 27:01.271
What did you say about him
wearing sharkskin pajamas?

27:02.316 --> 27:03.883
Something stupid.

27:05.711 --> 27:10.454
I guess he was a little thinner
sharkskin than we accounted for.

27:13.022 --> 27:14.458
Now what?

27:15.503 --> 27:17.853
We load up for bear. We fight.

27:17.897 --> 27:19.681
What happened
to the common good?

27:19.725 --> 27:22.075
Apparently, it's obsolete.

27:24.947 --> 27:28.864
Erin was likely copied on this.

27:28.908 --> 27:31.345
I'll tell her.

27:32.825 --> 27:34.783
No.

27:34.827 --> 27:36.829
That's on me.

27:41.442 --> 27:43.444
Yelena, could you take
the kids to their room?

27:48.144 --> 27:49.755
I told you,

27:49.798 --> 27:51.844
unless you have a warrant,
I don't want to talk to you.

27:51.887 --> 27:53.846
We're to make a notification.

27:53.889 --> 27:55.499
A notification? Of what?

27:55.543 --> 27:57.980
WITTEN:
You've called 911
on your husband several times.

27:58.024 --> 27:59.852
Between that
and Yelena's complaint...

28:01.375 --> 28:02.898
...we have reason to
believe this might not be

28:02.942 --> 28:04.813
a safe environment
for your children.

28:04.857 --> 28:06.989
What are you talking about?

28:07.033 --> 28:10.384
The Administration of Children's
Services has been notified.

28:10.427 --> 28:11.777
They've opened a case.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.256
So they're gonna
drop by here

28:13.300 --> 28:14.823
and they're gonna do
an investigation.

28:14.867 --> 28:16.738
Are you threatening to take
my kids away from me?

28:16.782 --> 28:18.609
We're just warning you
about an investigation.

28:18.653 --> 28:20.046
You have no right.

28:20.089 --> 28:23.353
Actually, we are bound
by law to report this.

28:23.397 --> 28:24.790
You don't understand.

28:28.010 --> 28:29.664
Did your husband hit Yelena?

28:29.708 --> 28:32.232
Mike is in therapy.
He isn't a bad guy.

28:32.275 --> 28:37.454
If your husband is abusive, you
need to think about your kids.

28:37.498 --> 28:38.978
They're trapped here,

28:39.021 --> 28:40.675
just like Yelena, just like you.

28:41.894 --> 28:43.591
You're asking me
to destroy my family.

28:43.634 --> 28:45.898
[door opens]I'm asking you to do
the right thing.

28:45.941 --> 28:47.116
[door closes]

28:47.160 --> 28:49.031
What's going on, Officers?

28:52.034 --> 28:52.905
Why don't you tell us?

28:52.948 --> 28:54.384
Did you call them?

28:54.428 --> 28:56.778
No. They were just
on their way out.

28:56.822 --> 28:58.040
Did Yelena?

28:58.084 --> 28:59.259
No.

28:59.302 --> 29:01.174
We'll talk about this.

29:11.314 --> 29:12.751
Wait.

29:15.101 --> 29:16.406
If we don't do what he wants,

29:16.450 --> 29:17.799
he locks us in a room
and beats us.

29:17.843 --> 29:19.975
I have photos of the bruises
on my body.

29:20.019 --> 29:21.760
I'd like to press charges.

29:21.803 --> 29:23.109
What?!

29:23.152 --> 29:23.979
You lying bitch.Hey, hey.

29:24.023 --> 29:25.633
You did this.

29:25.676 --> 29:27.809
You're under arrest.This is your fault!

29:27.853 --> 29:28.854
JANKO:
You're under arrest.
Hands behind your back.

29:28.897 --> 29:30.116
MIKE:
Okay...

29:30.159 --> 29:32.031
Ow.JANKO:
Stop fighting.

29:33.119 --> 29:35.774
Ow.
[grunts]

29:35.817 --> 29:37.732
[handcuffs click]

29:42.476 --> 29:44.652
He doesn't know I'm here.

29:44.695 --> 29:46.045
Right.

29:46.088 --> 29:47.350
Governor, look at me.

29:49.265 --> 29:50.614
He doesn't know I'm here.

29:50.658 --> 29:51.746
You say so.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.443
Are you recording
this conversation?

29:53.487 --> 29:55.097
What?

29:55.141 --> 29:56.795
Under New York State law, you
could record this conversation

29:56.838 --> 29:57.926
without informing me.

29:57.970 --> 29:59.798
I'm asking as a courtesy.

29:59.841 --> 30:01.538
No, we are not.

30:01.582 --> 30:03.149
Thank you.

30:03.192 --> 30:06.195
So, are you doing this
to punish me or my old man?

30:06.239 --> 30:07.936
I'm not punishing anybody.

30:07.980 --> 30:09.372
Yes, you are.

30:09.416 --> 30:12.201
You calling me a liar?

30:12.245 --> 30:13.768
No, but I'm calling you out.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.944
Moving the goalpost
was a cheap shot.

30:15.988 --> 30:18.817
You realize that it says
"governor" on that door.

30:18.860 --> 30:20.906
And if the governor's
being honest about not recording

30:20.949 --> 30:24.866
this conversation,
then this is just between us.

30:24.910 --> 30:27.434
I always look a gift horse
in the mouth.

30:27.477 --> 30:28.827
I even check its teeth.

30:28.870 --> 30:30.916
You ever regret that?

30:32.831 --> 30:33.962
A man asks

30:34.006 --> 30:37.313
to borrow a hammer,
you lend him one,

30:37.357 --> 30:39.576
he remembers that.

30:39.620 --> 30:42.884
He asks to borrow a hammer
and you hit him with it,

30:42.928 --> 30:45.191
he remembers that a lot more.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.238
Is this 'cause I passed
you over for D.A.?

30:51.327 --> 30:53.329
Oh, you're on a roll today,
aren't you?

30:53.373 --> 30:54.809
My family has flaws,

30:54.853 --> 30:56.071
just like anyone's--

30:56.115 --> 30:57.943
maybe even more--

30:57.986 --> 30:59.901
but I think this is one of them.

30:59.945 --> 31:01.685
That when we...

31:01.729 --> 31:03.905
give our word,

31:03.949 --> 31:07.430
we're foolish enough
to expect that trust in return.

31:08.910 --> 31:11.739
But you do what you got to do.

31:15.961 --> 31:17.788
Megan, pick up the phone.

31:17.832 --> 31:19.094
[phone ringing]

31:19.138 --> 31:20.879
Hello?DANNY:
Hey, Megan.

31:20.922 --> 31:22.881
It's Detective Reagan.
Where are you?

31:22.924 --> 31:24.099
I just got back to the hotel.

31:24.143 --> 31:25.709
I was just finishing up
some interviews.

31:25.753 --> 31:26.754
Okay, we're coming
to talk to you now.

31:26.797 --> 31:27.886
Don't go anywhere.

31:27.929 --> 31:30.584
What's going on, Detectives?

31:30.627 --> 31:32.194
Is everything okay?

31:32.238 --> 31:34.370
Just stay where you are.

31:34.414 --> 31:37.025
Who was that?

31:37.069 --> 31:40.550
Ralph, hi.

31:40.594 --> 31:42.248
That was my mom calling
to check in.

31:42.291 --> 31:45.468
Can we talk?
Okay.

31:45.512 --> 31:46.905
Just about the other night.

31:46.948 --> 31:48.297
I want to just
clear some things up.
