WEBVTT

00:07.050 --> 00:09.009
[distant siren wailing]

00:09.139 --> 00:10.445
Hey, what do we got?

00:10.488 --> 00:13.013
Homicide. Girl's name
was Andrea Davis.

00:13.056 --> 00:15.189
She was found dead
this morning.

00:16.538 --> 00:19.149
Ligature marks on her neck,
looks like she was strangled.

00:20.542 --> 00:21.717
Who found her?

00:21.760 --> 00:22.979
The young lady
in the adjoining room.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.502
She knew her.

00:24.546 --> 00:26.504
Well, let's see
who else know her.

00:26.548 --> 00:28.854
[exhales]

00:30.726 --> 00:32.858
DANNY:
Megan?

00:32.902 --> 00:35.774
Detective Reagan,
my partner Detective Baez.

00:35.818 --> 00:38.647
I can't believe this.

00:38.690 --> 00:41.998
You in town for the
Comic-Con or something?

00:42.042 --> 00:45.088
Yeah, we were, um, in town
for a video game tournament,

00:45.132 --> 00:47.438
and they put everybody up
at the hotel.

00:47.482 --> 00:49.005
I'm confused.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.138
You're here to watch
video games?

00:51.181 --> 00:53.879
No, to compete in them.

00:53.923 --> 00:55.577
FYI, Andrea is one

00:55.620 --> 00:58.145
of the most famous video game
streamers in the world.

00:58.188 --> 01:00.538
Famous?
Can you believe that?

01:00.582 --> 01:03.411
Yeah, actually,
my son's a fan of gamers.

01:03.454 --> 01:05.456
Now that you mention it,
uh...

01:05.500 --> 01:07.067
they make more money,
according to him.

01:07.110 --> 01:08.894
Especially Andrea.

01:08.938 --> 01:10.896
She had millions of followers.

01:10.940 --> 01:12.855
So you're
a professional gamer, too?

01:12.898 --> 01:14.683
I'm no Andrea, but yes.

01:14.726 --> 01:17.599
And we stuck together.

01:17.642 --> 01:19.209
Why is that?

01:19.253 --> 01:21.342
Because of the men in our world.

01:21.385 --> 01:24.388
No offense to your son,
I'm sure he's...

01:24.432 --> 01:26.086
a nice guy, but...

01:26.129 --> 01:28.305
for every fan
that sends us a gift,

01:28.349 --> 01:31.221
there are a hundred others
that are just...

01:31.265 --> 01:32.875
creeps.

01:32.918 --> 01:35.660
The pictures that they send us?

01:35.704 --> 01:38.054
The threats they make?

01:38.098 --> 01:39.621
"Threats"?

01:39.664 --> 01:40.796
Anyone ever threaten Andrea?

01:40.839 --> 01:43.103
A female gamer?

01:43.146 --> 01:45.627
Goes with.

01:51.023 --> 01:52.677
[indistinct chatter]

01:52.721 --> 01:54.114
Oh, what is that, nines?

01:54.157 --> 01:56.377
Ha! Try 10-2.

02:00.816 --> 02:03.906
[laughs] That's game!

02:03.949 --> 02:05.690
I don't think my knees
are what they used to be.

02:05.734 --> 02:08.128
[laughs] Come on, man,
you're not even that old.

02:08.171 --> 02:10.130
I can't believe
I even did this, man.

02:10.173 --> 02:12.175
What, signed up
for a mentorship program?

02:12.219 --> 02:14.482
Run by law enforcement.

02:14.525 --> 02:16.440
You should be proud
of your choices Deon.

02:16.484 --> 02:18.486
Come on, last game--
let's play to ten.

02:20.009 --> 02:21.880
MAN:
Is that Deon Williams?

02:21.924 --> 02:23.926
Hanging with the P.O.?

02:24.970 --> 02:27.538
Man, did you have
to wear that shirt?

02:27.582 --> 02:29.192
Who are these guys?

02:29.236 --> 02:30.715
You guys believe this?
[chuckles]

02:30.759 --> 02:33.022
Even for you,
this is next level.

02:33.065 --> 02:34.937
Yo, whatever Reggie.You gonna apply

02:34.980 --> 02:35.981
to the police academy, too?

02:36.025 --> 02:37.200
Become a pig?

02:37.244 --> 02:39.550
Hey... take it easy.

02:39.594 --> 02:42.205
Run along now, piggy.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.990
Let's just get out of here, man.

02:46.383 --> 02:48.951
Okay.

02:48.994 --> 02:50.909
REGGIE:
That's what I thought.

02:51.954 --> 02:54.696
Pension protections for cops
with 20 years on the job

02:54.739 --> 02:56.437
has been a home run.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.090
From a cop's perspective, sure.

02:58.134 --> 03:00.136
Well, that's the perspective
we generally have up here,

03:00.180 --> 03:01.833
in case you hadn't noticed.

03:01.877 --> 03:04.227
What the governor's
pushing-- one slip up

03:04.271 --> 03:06.664
and a vested cop loses
their whole pension

03:06.708 --> 03:07.839
and poof, there
goes retirement.

03:07.883 --> 03:10.842
I've got nothing
for that perspective.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.888
I'm listening.

03:14.324 --> 03:15.891
I don't have a dog in the hunt.

03:15.934 --> 03:18.937
I'm just trying to formulate
this department's response.

03:18.981 --> 03:20.983
Nah, you always got to play
the devil's advocate.

03:21.026 --> 03:22.898
Take the day
off for once.

03:22.941 --> 03:24.943
And it's not right
that a cop who's on the take,

03:24.987 --> 03:27.076
or perjures himself at trial
and gets the boot,

03:27.119 --> 03:29.034
still walks away
with his full pension.

03:29.078 --> 03:32.124
That's a few bad apples,
few and far between.

03:32.168 --> 03:34.257
More and closer together.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.911
I'm listening.

03:35.954 --> 03:38.435
And defending this policy
laughs in the face

03:38.479 --> 03:40.437
of all the reform flags
we're raising.

03:40.481 --> 03:43.310
No, it's us raising a flag
saying we're not gonna

03:43.353 --> 03:45.964
tear every single protection
the cops have

03:46.008 --> 03:47.966
to mollify the
city council.

03:48.010 --> 03:49.881
And all five
district attorneys.

03:49.925 --> 03:51.927
And the Yankees,
Giants, Knicks

03:51.970 --> 03:53.885
and Rangers, for all I care.

03:53.929 --> 03:55.974
I say we stand fast.

03:57.976 --> 04:00.544
Our best defense is sitting
across from us.

04:00.588 --> 04:02.372
You said the PC pushed
these protections through

04:02.416 --> 04:03.852
when he took office?

04:03.895 --> 04:06.028
Well, he's still more
admired and trusted

04:06.071 --> 04:07.812
than all of them
put together.

04:07.856 --> 04:10.250
Well, more than
the Knicks maybe.

04:11.468 --> 04:14.079
I say what he says goes.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.911
It was the consensus
of the press

04:19.955 --> 04:22.131
covering One PP
at the time, that morale

04:22.174 --> 04:24.176
was so low
when the PC took over

04:24.220 --> 04:26.353
that he supported the bill
just as an "attaboy."

04:26.396 --> 04:28.093
Easy there, Garrett.

04:28.137 --> 04:29.704
Yeah, come on,
that doesn't sound like him.

04:29.747 --> 04:30.966
That he saw
all the traps and threw

04:31.009 --> 04:32.010
his weight
behind it anyway.

04:32.054 --> 04:33.838
And they got it wrong.

04:33.882 --> 04:35.971
And please
do not promote hearsay

04:36.014 --> 04:38.060
about me to me.

04:42.543 --> 04:44.936
Okay, thank you, everyone.

04:48.113 --> 04:49.637
Garrett, you stay.

04:50.681 --> 04:51.900
[door opens]

04:55.338 --> 04:57.122
[door closes]

04:57.166 --> 05:00.169
If I overstepped, I apologize.

05:00.212 --> 05:02.214
You didn't.

05:05.043 --> 05:06.697
I didn't?

05:06.741 --> 05:08.003
[exhales]

05:08.046 --> 05:10.875
No.

05:10.919 --> 05:12.486
Look...

05:12.529 --> 05:16.054
that law needs to be repealed.

05:18.013 --> 05:21.103
But I need to stand
with the rank and file.

05:21.146 --> 05:23.366
Especially now.

05:23.410 --> 05:26.064
Now more than ever.

05:27.979 --> 05:29.981
How do I do that?

05:34.986 --> 05:37.075
â™ª

05:56.399 --> 05:57.835
"KYS, you griefer."

05:57.879 --> 06:01.361
It's like a foreign language.

06:01.404 --> 06:02.362
Hey, Dad.

06:02.405 --> 06:03.580
Hey, what are you doing here?

06:03.624 --> 06:04.799
Take the keys out
from under the mat again?

06:04.842 --> 06:07.410
You mean did you
forget your keys again?

06:07.454 --> 06:09.064
Like father, like son.

06:09.107 --> 06:11.371
Yeah.What are you working on?

06:11.414 --> 06:12.981
I don't know,
to be honest with you.

06:13.024 --> 06:14.896
I don't understand
this Internet jargon.

06:14.939 --> 06:17.594
Maybe you can help me out--
KYS, what does that mean?

06:17.638 --> 06:18.595
Kill yourself.

06:18.639 --> 06:20.641
"Kill yourself"?
Yeah.

06:20.684 --> 06:21.772
You working on
the Andrea Davis case?

06:21.816 --> 06:23.644
Yeah, you figured
that out already?

06:23.687 --> 06:25.559
It's all over the Internet

06:25.602 --> 06:27.996
that she was killed
in the middle of a competition.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.345
You got any leads?

06:29.389 --> 06:31.173
I got too many leads.

06:31.216 --> 06:32.740
Can I see?

06:32.783 --> 06:34.437
Okay, Detective.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.918
Tell me if you recognize
any of them.

06:36.961 --> 06:39.747
This guy, Ralph Lamont,
ShowStunner?

06:39.790 --> 06:41.444
What about him? Who is he?

06:41.488 --> 06:43.098
He's a big-time
esports commentator.

06:43.141 --> 06:45.579
The face of Intensify Games,
he runs all of their events.

06:45.622 --> 06:47.232
Uh-huh.

06:47.276 --> 06:48.799
He got in a lot of trouble for
saying some pretty harsh stuff

06:48.843 --> 06:50.453
about female gamers last year.

06:50.497 --> 06:52.281
Say anything about Andrea?

06:52.324 --> 06:54.022
Have any beef
with her personally?

06:54.065 --> 06:55.632
He went after her physically,
mentally

06:55.676 --> 06:56.981
and her sexual orientation.

06:57.025 --> 06:59.114
They got in a
massive fight,

06:59.157 --> 07:00.681
and he had to issue
a public apology.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.334
Almost lost his job.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.209
Like father, like son indeed.

07:07.252 --> 07:08.210
Good work, kid.

07:08.253 --> 07:09.820
See you at home?
Yes.

07:12.649 --> 07:14.651
[indistinct chatter]

07:16.958 --> 07:19.482
Can you hold onto
this for me?

07:19.526 --> 07:20.701
Yeah, why?

07:20.744 --> 07:23.443
Safer in a cop's bag
than mine, right?

07:23.486 --> 07:25.053
[laughs]

07:27.316 --> 07:28.839
Belonged to my dad.

07:28.883 --> 07:31.929
It's the only time
I ever take it off.

07:31.973 --> 07:33.757
I understand.

07:38.762 --> 07:40.460
All right.

07:42.853 --> 07:44.942
Are you serious?What?

07:44.986 --> 07:46.683
You really expect me
to play with this?

07:46.727 --> 07:48.685
Come on, I got to throw
your game off somehow.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.166
Come on.

07:56.780 --> 07:58.782
Worried about those guys
showing up again?

08:00.697 --> 08:01.959
They're in a gang, aren't they?

08:02.003 --> 08:03.700
Look, I'm just trying
to stay in my own lane

08:03.744 --> 08:05.354
and do right by me.

08:05.397 --> 08:06.790
That's why I signed up for this
program in the first place.

08:06.834 --> 08:08.444
I get that.And I get you're a cop,

08:08.488 --> 08:10.011
and you want to know
about the Dead Twins,

08:10.054 --> 08:11.621
but I'd rather stay clear
and keep my head down.

08:11.665 --> 08:12.753
Now let's play.

08:17.409 --> 08:19.760
[laughs]

08:19.803 --> 08:21.588
Look at that. See, you wasn't
ready for all of that.

08:21.631 --> 08:23.851
Come on, you see?
I had the... [laughs]

08:23.894 --> 08:26.723
So those guys are members
of the Dead Twins?

08:27.898 --> 08:29.334
Yeah.

08:29.378 --> 08:30.814
Same guys who robbed
that bodega last week?

08:30.858 --> 08:32.903
I don't think
it's the same guys, but...

08:32.947 --> 08:34.252
Yeah, but they're affiliated?

08:36.211 --> 08:38.343
They beat that bodega owner
within an inch of his life.

08:38.387 --> 08:39.823
He'll probably never walk again.

08:41.738 --> 08:43.218
Those are bad guys, Deon.

08:43.261 --> 08:44.480
Can we just play?

08:44.524 --> 08:46.264
If you know anything though...

08:46.308 --> 08:47.788
that can help,
you got to tell me.

08:47.831 --> 08:49.224
Look, I ain't no snitch.

08:49.267 --> 08:50.660
Now what if those guys go out

08:50.704 --> 08:52.140
and kill somebody next time?

08:53.750 --> 08:55.099
Do you want to stay silent
and let that happen?

08:56.710 --> 08:58.755
I guess I can ask around.

08:58.799 --> 09:00.452
No, I don't want you
to ask around.

09:00.496 --> 09:01.802
Just keep your ears open,
let me know

09:01.845 --> 09:03.891
if you hear anything, all right?

09:03.934 --> 09:05.675
That's it.

09:07.329 --> 09:08.286
Come on.

09:10.724 --> 09:11.986
Come on, let's play.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.990
Aw, that was all luck!

09:16.033 --> 09:17.469
I wasn't paying attention.

09:17.513 --> 09:18.993
The light was
in my eyes.
Let's go.

09:19.036 --> 09:21.778
Oh, okay, let's see
what those old knees got!

09:21.822 --> 09:24.085
We got to get
our gold shields.

09:24.128 --> 09:25.782
I'm about done
with this wardrobe.

09:25.826 --> 09:27.567
Pants riding?

09:27.610 --> 09:30.961
No, it's the
thousand-pound belt.

09:31.005 --> 09:32.528
Swear it's gonna
give me back...

09:34.008 --> 09:36.140
WOMAN:
I agree. Hey, watch it.

09:36.184 --> 09:38.447
Hey, excuse me?

09:40.188 --> 09:41.493
You okay?

09:41.537 --> 09:44.932
See this? She's crazy!
She's totally crazy!

09:44.975 --> 09:46.890
I mean, how can anyone
live like this?

09:46.934 --> 09:48.805
S-Slow down, and just
tell us what happened.

09:48.849 --> 09:49.937
I'm being abused.

09:49.980 --> 09:51.591
Who's abusing you?This family

09:51.634 --> 09:53.680
that I work for.
I'm a live-in nanny.

09:53.723 --> 09:54.637
Which apartment?

09:54.681 --> 09:56.334
15B and...MAN: Sorry.

09:56.378 --> 09:58.554
Officers, this is such
a misunderstanding.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.469
Yelena, are you okay?Who are you?

10:00.512 --> 10:02.558
Mike Dougherty.
I'm so sorry, Yelena.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.952
This is a terrible accident.
Here's what happened.

10:04.995 --> 10:06.649
One of our children's

10:06.693 --> 10:08.869
really rambunctious
and hit her with a toy.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.871
One of your kids did that?

10:10.914 --> 10:12.568
It's horribly embarrassing.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.483
Is that true?

10:14.526 --> 10:17.181
We will do better,
I promise.

10:17.225 --> 10:18.966
The kids are feeling
really cooped up right now.

10:19.009 --> 10:20.968
It's hard to keep them
under control,

10:21.011 --> 10:22.665
but that's our fault
as parents.

10:22.709 --> 10:23.884
Is that really what happened?

10:25.276 --> 10:26.756
Come on, let's go back inside.
I'll get you some ice.

10:26.800 --> 10:27.931
Sorry to have troubled you.

10:27.975 --> 10:31.239
If you need anything,
you call us, okay?

10:34.329 --> 10:36.113
â™ª

10:39.900 --> 10:41.379
You buy that
the kids did that?

10:41.423 --> 10:42.990
Not for a second.

10:44.992 --> 10:47.124
It's like we're waiting
for The Beebs or something.

10:47.168 --> 10:48.952
Hmm. More like the, uh...

10:48.996 --> 10:50.214
King of the Nerds.

10:50.258 --> 10:51.825
[elevator bell dings]

10:51.868 --> 10:53.914
Excuse us, please.

10:53.957 --> 10:56.438
Actually, uh,
Detective Reagan.

10:56.481 --> 10:57.700
My partner Detective Baez.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.528
We need a word
with Mr. Lamont.

10:59.571 --> 11:01.182
Can it wait
until after today's games?

11:01.225 --> 11:02.749
We're late for our broadcast
and we really got to get going.

11:02.792 --> 11:04.402
Sure, we'll just let
all the gamers know

11:04.446 --> 11:05.882
that Mr. Lamont's
a person of interest

11:05.926 --> 11:07.928
in the murder of Andrea Davis.
How's that sound?

11:07.971 --> 11:09.712
Just give me a second.

11:09.756 --> 11:10.974
Detectives.

11:11.018 --> 11:13.150
What happened to Andrea was
just horrible.

11:13.194 --> 11:14.761
If there's anything
I can do to help.

11:14.804 --> 11:16.850
When was the last time
you saw Andrea?

11:16.893 --> 11:19.374
Uh, not since Tuesday's event.

11:19.417 --> 11:21.550
And you didn't see her,
after the event in the hotel?

11:21.593 --> 11:22.899
No, I've been... [chuckles]

11:22.943 --> 11:24.945
I've been really, really busy.

11:24.988 --> 11:26.990
So, um...

11:27.034 --> 11:28.513
Wait, you don't think

11:28.557 --> 11:29.689
I had something to do with this,
do you?

11:29.732 --> 11:30.907
You had a pretty big argument
with Andrea

11:30.951 --> 11:32.082
a few months ago.

11:32.126 --> 11:33.562
You took a big hit
to your reputation.

11:33.605 --> 11:35.477
We made amends after that.

11:35.520 --> 11:36.478
I was in the wrong.

11:36.521 --> 11:38.262
I released a statement.

11:38.306 --> 11:39.524
Look, we're holding

11:39.568 --> 11:40.656
a live memorial for her
right now.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.353
So I really got to go.

11:42.397 --> 11:43.703
Sure, uh,

11:43.746 --> 11:45.966
is there anyone who can verify
your whereabouts

11:46.009 --> 11:47.445
after the event on Tuesday?

11:47.489 --> 11:50.100
My producer, Mason. So...

11:50.144 --> 11:51.623
Sorry,
if you guys need anything else,

11:51.667 --> 11:52.929
you just have to talk
to my lawyers.

11:59.675 --> 12:01.677
[quiet chatter]

12:07.204 --> 12:09.511
Garrett, what a surprise.

12:09.554 --> 12:10.817
Great to see you.

12:15.169 --> 12:16.344
Been a long time.

12:17.475 --> 12:19.564
I know how much you love
crabmeat salad.

12:19.608 --> 12:23.264
They fly theirs in
from Alaska twice a week.

12:24.308 --> 12:26.397
Sounds good.

12:33.230 --> 12:35.493
So, what else are we doing here?

12:39.541 --> 12:40.977
We need a fixer.

12:43.980 --> 12:45.112
The governor's push

12:45.155 --> 12:46.940
to claw back
pension protections--

12:46.983 --> 12:48.289
we've got a problem.

12:48.332 --> 12:49.899
I can't help you.

12:49.943 --> 12:52.467
My boss supports it 100%.

12:52.510 --> 12:54.512
So do I.

12:55.513 --> 12:56.993
You do?

12:57.037 --> 12:58.386
Yes.

12:59.735 --> 13:01.258
But he can't be seen
as supporting it.

13:01.302 --> 13:02.477
For obvious reasons.

13:02.520 --> 13:05.349
I need to stand with my cops.

13:05.393 --> 13:06.698
And he is.

13:06.742 --> 13:08.700
But the rank and file
wouldn't see it that way.

13:08.744 --> 13:10.877
The law as it is

13:10.920 --> 13:13.270
allows too many temptations

13:13.314 --> 13:15.011
for veteran cops
to play it fast and loose

13:15.055 --> 13:16.491
on their last laps.

13:18.667 --> 13:21.539
Erin, the guardrails
need to go back up

13:21.583 --> 13:24.325
for everybody's sake,
including my cops.

13:24.368 --> 13:26.588
And this has to do with me how?

13:29.896 --> 13:32.507
We thought maybe
you could communicate that

13:32.550 --> 13:33.856
to the governor.

13:37.468 --> 13:39.862
Privately, I agree with him
on this one,

13:39.906 --> 13:42.125
but publicly,
I have to oppose him.

13:42.169 --> 13:44.171
Strenuously oppose.

13:44.214 --> 13:46.608
Yeah, but see, Erin,
here's the deal.

13:46.651 --> 13:50.394
You could assure him
that whatever I say or do

13:50.438 --> 13:51.874
is just for show.

13:52.919 --> 13:56.009
I'm a prosecutor, not a fixer.

13:57.053 --> 13:59.751
Well, maybe that wasn't
the right word.

13:59.795 --> 14:01.971
You can use
whatever word you want.

14:02.015 --> 14:03.581
I cannot do this.

14:03.625 --> 14:05.932
And I could've told you that
in a simple phone call,

14:05.975 --> 14:08.586
instead of a schlep out
to Sheepshead Bay.

14:08.630 --> 14:11.589
So, you can't help,
or you won't help?

14:12.634 --> 14:14.810
Why don't you just
tell him yourself?

14:14.854 --> 14:16.725
It can't come from me.

14:16.768 --> 14:18.640
Okay. Okay, then you.

14:18.683 --> 14:19.902
I work for him.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.425
If the governor balks,

14:21.469 --> 14:23.340
all you have to say is,

14:23.384 --> 14:25.995
"I know my father.
I know what he wants here."

14:26.039 --> 14:28.215
You're the only person
with that latitude,

14:28.258 --> 14:29.869
and the only one we can trust

14:29.912 --> 14:31.392
to carry this out.

14:31.435 --> 14:35.091
What if I don't want to be
trusted to carry this out?

14:36.136 --> 14:38.790
Well, you'd be missing
an opportunity

14:38.834 --> 14:40.792
to act for the common good--

14:40.836 --> 14:44.927
an opportunity that doesn't
come along that often.

14:46.842 --> 14:50.063
I'm not telling, I'm asking.

14:50.106 --> 14:52.326
Of course, it's up to you, Erin.

14:53.849 --> 14:55.895
â™ª

15:12.041 --> 15:14.043
â™ª

15:20.006 --> 15:21.268
[sighs]

15:21.311 --> 15:23.357
[dog barking in distance]

15:27.448 --> 15:28.928
Hi, Ms. Williams.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.364
I'm Jamie Reagan.

15:30.407 --> 15:31.539
He doesn't want to see you
right now.

15:31.582 --> 15:32.757
It's okay, Mom.

15:34.411 --> 15:36.587
It's okay.

15:37.632 --> 15:39.634
â™ª

15:43.290 --> 15:44.856
What happened?

15:44.900 --> 15:46.510
Can you give us a minute?

15:52.038 --> 15:54.214
It's not as bad as it looks.

15:55.258 --> 15:56.956
It's because you were
asking around

15:56.999 --> 15:58.261
about the robbery, isn't it?

15:59.915 --> 16:01.047
They stole your watch?

16:02.744 --> 16:03.832
Yeah.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.012
I'm sorry.

16:10.056 --> 16:11.622
Was it those guys from the gym?

16:12.667 --> 16:13.798
I'm dropping out of the program.

16:13.842 --> 16:15.148
Whoa, whoa.

16:15.191 --> 16:17.889
H-Hold on.
We-we can make this right.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.282
Just tell me who did this.

16:19.326 --> 16:20.980
And then I'll end up
with worse than a black eye.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.416
They're just gonna keep on
hurting people, Deon.

16:22.459 --> 16:23.895
When I signed up

16:23.939 --> 16:25.897
for this program, I thought
it was for a mentorship.

16:25.941 --> 16:27.899
Not to be used as a rat.

16:27.943 --> 16:29.466
That's not what this is.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.381
This whole thing was a mistake.

16:31.425 --> 16:32.992
You really believe that?

16:34.863 --> 16:36.604
Is there something you want
to tell me, Deon?

16:38.084 --> 16:39.955
I don't need a savior.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.696
And I don't want
to see you anymore.

16:41.739 --> 16:43.176
So, please, just go.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.008
â™ª

16:55.492 --> 16:57.929
Wish we could do
something for Yelena.

16:57.973 --> 17:00.367
Easy, Janko, you don't have
your gold shield yet.

17:00.410 --> 17:01.846
She is trapped

17:01.890 --> 17:03.587
in a bad situation.

17:03.631 --> 17:05.720
MAN [over radio]:
Any 2-9 unit available
to respond.

17:05.763 --> 17:08.157
111 East 48th Street

17:08.201 --> 17:09.898
for a disorderly
and intoxicated male.

17:09.941 --> 17:12.205
Sector David is out
on another job.

17:12.248 --> 17:14.859
I bet they are.That is Yelena's apartment.

17:14.903 --> 17:16.905
We got to take that.

17:16.948 --> 17:18.602
It's all the way on
the other side of the precinct.

17:18.646 --> 17:20.822
Yeah, it'll give us an excuse
to check in on her.

17:20.865 --> 17:21.997
That wasn't the call.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.999
I'm aware.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.004
Hello, Officers.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.050
Could you take the kids?

17:35.445 --> 17:37.012
Can I help you?We've had reports

17:37.056 --> 17:39.406
of a disorderly,
possibly intoxicated person

17:39.449 --> 17:40.755
in the building.

17:40.798 --> 17:42.017
Have you heard anything?

17:42.061 --> 17:43.540
No, nothing here.

17:43.584 --> 17:44.759
What about her?

17:44.802 --> 17:46.761
Can we talk to her
for a minute?

17:46.804 --> 17:49.024
No. Like I said,
we didn't hear anything.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.112
Oh, it's-it's just
that I...

17:50.156 --> 17:51.592
I recognize her.

17:51.635 --> 17:53.942
Um... Yelena, right?

17:55.291 --> 17:56.292
We ran into her

17:56.336 --> 17:58.033
in the street
the other day.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.339
Did you call them?

17:59.382 --> 18:01.341
No, I didn't, I swear.

18:01.384 --> 18:02.951
This could get you
kicked out of the country.

18:02.994 --> 18:04.866
Do you understand that?

18:04.909 --> 18:05.954
I'm telling the truth.

18:07.912 --> 18:09.305
Unless you have a warrant,

18:09.349 --> 18:11.438
what happens in this house
is none of your business.

18:11.481 --> 18:14.267
Oh, it's none of our business
that you beat your nanny?

18:14.310 --> 18:15.703
Eddie.

18:17.879 --> 18:19.185
Hey.

18:19.228 --> 18:21.970
If you want to talk to us,
she can't stop you.

18:23.406 --> 18:24.973
I'm okay.

18:26.192 --> 18:27.932
I told you.

18:27.976 --> 18:29.369
Now go.

18:31.719 --> 18:33.938
[sighs][door lock clicks]

18:33.982 --> 18:35.549
You happy?

18:37.072 --> 18:38.378
[scoffs softly]

18:42.164 --> 18:43.034
[door closes]

18:52.131 --> 18:53.828
Morning.

18:53.871 --> 18:56.091
Sorry to drop in on you
like this.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.267
Not at all.
You want some coffee?

18:58.311 --> 19:00.051
Had some.

19:03.968 --> 19:06.057
Then let's have it.

19:08.059 --> 19:09.626
I was heading up the FDR

19:09.670 --> 19:12.455
on the way up to Albany
to see the governor, and...

19:12.499 --> 19:15.502
You thought you'd take the
scenic route through Brooklyn.

19:15.545 --> 19:18.069
You sure you want to do this?

19:20.724 --> 19:23.466
I'm sure I want the governor
to know I want him

19:23.510 --> 19:26.077
to change the law, yes.

19:26.121 --> 19:29.211
If you mean,
do I want you involved...

19:34.477 --> 19:35.957
Erin,

19:36.000 --> 19:39.830
I couldn't see a better way
to let him know

19:39.874 --> 19:42.050
and keep it off the record.

19:45.184 --> 19:49.449
Do you want to do this,
I guess, is the real question.

19:50.493 --> 19:53.670
I guess I'm used to this
coming from my brothers--

19:53.714 --> 19:56.064
cutting corners,

19:56.107 --> 19:57.848
"just this once,"

19:57.892 --> 19:59.198
"do me this solid,

19:59.241 --> 20:01.069
and I'll owe you," you know.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.246
I'm not used to it
coming from you.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.989
And it bothers you.

20:08.032 --> 20:10.687
I-I don't know, I...

20:11.732 --> 20:14.430
Figured your old man was better
than that.

20:14.474 --> 20:17.346
Asking you to deal
off the bottom of the deck.

20:18.391 --> 20:20.610
Is that what you're
asking me to do?

20:23.265 --> 20:25.267
[sighs] Well...

20:27.138 --> 20:29.053
In the right light,
you can make that case--

20:29.097 --> 20:30.490
without sentiment,

20:30.533 --> 20:34.276
without the "family first"
shine on it, yeah.

20:34.320 --> 20:37.714
And there's no other way
to do this except through me?

20:37.758 --> 20:39.847
I don't know, there could be.

20:41.283 --> 20:44.068
Garrett and I sure as hell
couldn't come up with one,

20:44.112 --> 20:48.899
not on the time line
and not with what's at stake.

20:48.943 --> 20:50.423
And it's really
for the common good?

20:50.466 --> 20:53.164
There's-there's
no other angle here, right?

20:53.208 --> 20:55.166
If there was, you'd know.

20:56.167 --> 20:58.822
I would make sure you knew.

21:08.223 --> 21:10.225
My appointment's at 11:00.
I got to go.

21:11.270 --> 21:14.925
There's a whole lot of exits
on the road to Albany.

21:15.970 --> 21:18.102
[sighs]

21:18.146 --> 21:20.366
You want to take one,

21:20.409 --> 21:23.717
turn back,
I'm good with that.

21:25.196 --> 21:26.981
I'll talk to you.

21:34.075 --> 21:36.077
[sighs]

21:37.296 --> 21:39.080
[mutters softly]

21:40.124 --> 21:41.474
The common good?

21:41.517 --> 21:43.127
Yes.

21:43.171 --> 21:44.346
That's a good one.

21:44.390 --> 21:46.174
It's not a joke.

21:46.217 --> 21:47.915
The commissioner feels,
as you do,

21:47.958 --> 21:51.875
that the current laws protecting
cops' pensions goes too far.

21:51.919 --> 21:54.965
Which is setting all kinds
of alarms in my head.

21:55.009 --> 21:56.967
No one is above the law.

21:57.011 --> 21:58.404
If my father had a tattoo,

21:58.447 --> 22:00.188
that's exactly
what it would say.

22:00.231 --> 22:02.146
Uh-huh.

22:02.190 --> 22:06.760
And when a veteran cop
can break the law

22:06.803 --> 22:10.024
knowing he will still walk away
with his hundred K pension,

22:10.067 --> 22:12.200
well, that's wrong.

22:12.243 --> 22:13.636
Oh, I know that.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.508
I'm just surprised
to hear you peddling

22:15.551 --> 22:17.553
that your old man agrees.

22:17.597 --> 22:19.381
I am not peddling anything.

22:19.425 --> 22:20.904
I'm sharing information

22:20.948 --> 22:24.212
that he wants you,
and you alone, to have.

22:24.255 --> 22:26.301
Well, you and me, alone.

22:28.259 --> 22:30.958
What does he want me
to do with it?

22:31.001 --> 22:33.961
Ignore whatever comes out of
One PP in regards to this bill.

22:34.004 --> 22:35.702
That I'm a
"defund the police" guy.

22:35.745 --> 22:37.138
Another radical lefty

22:37.181 --> 22:39.096
from the "blue lives
don't matter" crowd.

22:39.140 --> 22:42.883
I have no idea what the return
fire is going to sound like.

22:42.926 --> 22:44.667
I do.

22:44.711 --> 22:46.887
I've been on the receiving end
of it before.

22:46.930 --> 22:49.019
You have ignored it before.

22:49.063 --> 22:50.543
Ignore it again.

22:50.586 --> 22:54.068
Your old man is well-respected
way beyond city limits.

22:54.111 --> 22:55.722
Giving him short shrift

22:55.765 --> 23:00.291
always costs me something and
never gained me a single vote.

23:00.335 --> 23:02.946
I am sure he will owe you one.

23:04.121 --> 23:05.296
Did he say that?

23:06.385 --> 23:08.865
No. I said that.

23:08.909 --> 23:10.563
Are you wearing a wire?

23:10.606 --> 23:12.347
Are you kidding me?

23:12.391 --> 23:14.001
Half kidding.

23:16.612 --> 23:18.658
It really is
for the common good.

23:18.701 --> 23:20.964
Thank you for your time.

23:22.444 --> 23:23.663
Aren't you forgetting something?

23:24.838 --> 23:25.882
What?

23:25.926 --> 23:27.710
"We never had
this conversation"?

23:27.754 --> 23:29.886
That goes without saying.

23:29.930 --> 23:32.759
Tell him to expect a final draft
of the bill in the morning.

23:32.802 --> 23:34.935
He should know exactly

23:34.978 --> 23:38.199
what he's fake fighting
against, right?

23:42.159 --> 23:44.988
[door opens, closes]

23:48.035 --> 23:50.037
[indistinct chatter]

23:51.386 --> 23:53.736
Hey. Got the time?

23:53.780 --> 23:56.696
Wait, you're that cop
from the center, aren't you?

23:56.739 --> 23:59.612
You're Reggie,
member of the Dead Twins?

23:59.655 --> 24:00.656
Deon sent you?

24:00.700 --> 24:02.571
No. He doesn't know I'm here.

24:02.615 --> 24:04.181
You guys believe this?

24:04.225 --> 24:06.880
Of all the people
to get mixed up with a cop.

24:06.923 --> 24:08.621
Blood turning against blood.

24:08.664 --> 24:10.144
It's not right.

24:10.187 --> 24:12.799
What's that mean?
Blood turning against blood?

24:12.842 --> 24:16.367
Look, whatever happened
with Deon

24:16.411 --> 24:17.847
had nothing to do with us.

24:17.891 --> 24:19.501
Now, we're just minding
our own business.

24:19.545 --> 24:21.024
Why don't you do the same?

24:21.068 --> 24:23.723
Looks like you've got
Deon's watch, too.

24:23.766 --> 24:25.681
Was a gift.

24:25.725 --> 24:27.466
It's criminal possession
of stolen property.

24:27.509 --> 24:28.684
Wasn't me who stole it.

24:28.728 --> 24:30.599
You know what?

24:30.643 --> 24:34.385
Fine. Take it.

24:34.429 --> 24:35.865
Felt weird having it anyway.

24:35.909 --> 24:37.998
Who gave it to you?

24:38.041 --> 24:40.653
You got his watch back, man.
That's all you're getting.

24:40.696 --> 24:42.263
No, not unless you don't want
a ride to the station.

24:42.306 --> 24:43.656
Tell me what I
want to know,

24:43.699 --> 24:44.831
or you're going in cuffs.

24:44.874 --> 24:46.485
It's your call.

24:51.098 --> 24:54.493
These messages Andrea
received are just horrible.

24:54.536 --> 24:55.842
The worst of them
coming from this guy

24:55.885 --> 24:58.235
going by the name
ShowStunner.

24:58.279 --> 24:59.628
Ralph's handle.

24:59.672 --> 25:01.804
Sean was right,
he's a total prick.

25:01.848 --> 25:03.719
Yeah.That said, it's
been months

25:03.763 --> 25:05.547
since he last messaged her.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.636
Doesn't mean he wasn't
still holding a grudge.

25:07.680 --> 25:10.683
True, but could be time
we look elsewhere.

25:10.726 --> 25:13.294
I think I figured out
where elsewhere is.

25:13.337 --> 25:15.339
What is it?Come see.

25:17.211 --> 25:19.213
The cameras outside of
Andrea's door weren't working,

25:19.256 --> 25:22.259
but this is footage
from the hotel bar.

25:23.304 --> 25:24.697
That's Ralph.

25:24.740 --> 25:26.786
BAEZ:
Guess he wasn't as busy

25:26.829 --> 25:28.701
as he said he was.Right. And that's Megan Mills.

25:31.878 --> 25:33.923
For a second there, it
looks just like Andrea.

25:33.967 --> 25:36.186
Yeah. Same height,
same pink hair.

25:36.230 --> 25:38.188
And they had
adjoining hotel rooms.

25:40.626 --> 25:43.193
Do you think he made a mistake
and went after the wrong girl?

25:43.237 --> 25:44.412
Think we might have
been looking

25:44.455 --> 25:46.457
at the wrong mark
the whole time.

25:56.250 --> 25:58.339
[door opens]

26:11.700 --> 26:13.746
That bad, huh?

26:14.834 --> 26:18.011
If this new draft
was a gesture...

26:18.054 --> 26:19.273
that'd be it.

26:20.491 --> 26:22.276
Walk me through it.
I got to think.

26:22.319 --> 26:24.887
Our amendment calls for
a case-by-case review

26:24.931 --> 26:26.410
of cops' infractions.

26:26.454 --> 26:28.761
Well, that's what we needed.
This isn't that?

26:28.804 --> 26:31.764
No. This is wholesale.

26:31.807 --> 26:35.985
Means any infraction
requires complete forfeiture

26:36.029 --> 26:37.421
of a cop's pension.

26:37.465 --> 26:39.815
So a questionable couple
of minutes of phone video

26:39.859 --> 26:42.905
carries the same penalty
as shaking down a drug lord.

26:44.690 --> 26:45.821
Son of a bitch.

26:45.865 --> 26:47.301
You bowed your head.

26:47.344 --> 26:49.999
He wants to see if you'll
genuflect and kiss the ring.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.742
You have pushed back pretty
hard on his rhetoric last year.

26:53.786 --> 26:55.004
You can see why it backfired.

26:55.048 --> 26:56.658
Well, that's what I do
when someone

26:56.702 --> 26:58.965
calls my cops racist.

26:59.008 --> 27:01.271
What did you say about him
wearing sharkskin pajamas?

27:02.316 --> 27:03.883
Something stupid.

27:05.711 --> 27:10.454
I guess he was a little thinner
sharkskin than we accounted for.

27:13.022 --> 27:14.458
Now what?

27:15.503 --> 27:17.853
We load up for bear. We fight.

27:17.897 --> 27:19.681
What happened
to the common good?

27:19.725 --> 27:22.075
Apparently, it's obsolete.

27:24.947 --> 27:28.864
Erin was likely copied on this.

27:28.908 --> 27:31.345
I'll tell her.

27:32.825 --> 27:34.783
No.

27:34.827 --> 27:36.829
That's on me.

27:41.442 --> 27:43.444
Yelena, could you take
the kids to their room?

27:48.144 --> 27:49.755
I told you,

27:49.798 --> 27:51.844
unless you have a warrant,
I don't want to talk to you.

27:51.887 --> 27:53.846
We're to make a notification.

27:53.889 --> 27:55.499
A notification? Of what?

27:55.543 --> 27:57.980
WITTEN:
You've called 911
on your husband several times.

27:58.024 --> 27:59.852
Between that
and Yelena's complaint...

28:01.375 --> 28:02.898
...we have reason to
believe this might not be

28:02.942 --> 28:04.813
a safe environment
for your children.

28:04.857 --> 28:06.989
What are you talking about?

28:07.033 --> 28:10.384
The Administration of Children's
Services has been notified.

28:10.427 --> 28:11.777
They've opened a case.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.256
So they're gonna
drop by here

28:13.300 --> 28:14.823
and they're gonna do
an investigation.

28:14.867 --> 28:16.738
Are you threatening to take
my kids away from me?

28:16.782 --> 28:18.609
We're just warning you
about an investigation.

28:18.653 --> 28:20.046
You have no right.

28:20.089 --> 28:23.353
Actually, we are bound
by law to report this.

28:23.397 --> 28:24.790
You don't understand.

28:28.010 --> 28:29.664
Did your husband hit Yelena?

28:29.708 --> 28:32.232
Mike is in therapy.
He isn't a bad guy.

28:32.275 --> 28:37.454
If your husband is abusive, you
need to think about your kids.

28:37.498 --> 28:38.978
They're trapped here,

28:39.021 --> 28:40.675
just like Yelena, just like you.

28:41.894 --> 28:43.591
You're asking me
to destroy my family.

28:43.634 --> 28:45.898
[door opens]I'm asking you to do
the right thing.

28:45.941 --> 28:47.116
[door closes]

28:47.160 --> 28:49.031
What's going on, Officers?

28:52.034 --> 28:52.905
Why don't you tell us?

28:52.948 --> 28:54.384
Did you call them?

28:54.428 --> 28:56.778
No. They were just
on their way out.

28:56.822 --> 28:58.040
Did Yelena?

28:58.084 --> 28:59.259
No.

28:59.302 --> 29:01.174
We'll talk about this.

29:11.314 --> 29:12.751
Wait.

29:15.101 --> 29:16.406
If we don't do what he wants,

29:16.450 --> 29:17.799
he locks us in a room
and beats us.

29:17.843 --> 29:19.975
I have photos of the bruises
on my body.

29:20.019 --> 29:21.760
I'd like to press charges.

29:21.803 --> 29:23.109
What?!

29:23.152 --> 29:23.979
You lying bitch.Hey, hey.

29:24.023 --> 29:25.633
You did this.

29:25.676 --> 29:27.809
You're under arrest.This is your fault!

29:27.853 --> 29:28.854
JANKO:
You're under arrest.
Hands behind your back.

29:28.897 --> 29:30.116
MIKE:
Okay...

29:30.159 --> 29:32.031
Ow.JANKO:
Stop fighting.

29:33.119 --> 29:35.774
Ow.
[grunts]

29:35.817 --> 29:37.732
[handcuffs click]

29:42.476 --> 29:44.652
He doesn't know I'm here.

29:44.695 --> 29:46.045
Right.

29:46.088 --> 29:47.350
Governor, look at me.

29:49.265 --> 29:50.614
He doesn't know I'm here.

29:50.658 --> 29:51.746
You say so.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.443
Are you recording
this conversation?

29:53.487 --> 29:55.097
What?

29:55.141 --> 29:56.795
Under New York State law, you
could record this conversation

29:56.838 --> 29:57.926
without informing me.

29:57.970 --> 29:59.798
I'm asking as a courtesy.

29:59.841 --> 30:01.538
No, we are not.

30:01.582 --> 30:03.149
Thank you.

30:03.192 --> 30:06.195
So, are you doing this
to punish me or my old man?

30:06.239 --> 30:07.936
I'm not punishing anybody.

30:07.980 --> 30:09.372
Yes, you are.

30:09.416 --> 30:12.201
You calling me a liar?

30:12.245 --> 30:13.768
No, but I'm calling you out.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.944
Moving the goalpost
was a cheap shot.

30:15.988 --> 30:18.817
You realize that it says
"governor" on that door.

30:18.860 --> 30:20.906
And if the governor's
being honest about not recording

30:20.949 --> 30:24.866
this conversation,
then this is just between us.

30:24.910 --> 30:27.434
I always look a gift horse
in the mouth.

30:27.477 --> 30:28.827
I even check its teeth.

30:28.870 --> 30:30.916
You ever regret that?

30:32.831 --> 30:33.962
A man asks

30:34.006 --> 30:37.313
to borrow a hammer,
you lend him one,

30:37.357 --> 30:39.576
he remembers that.

30:39.620 --> 30:42.884
He asks to borrow a hammer
and you hit him with it,

30:42.928 --> 30:45.191
he remembers that a lot more.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.238
Is this 'cause I passed
you over for D.A.?

30:51.327 --> 30:53.329
Oh, you're on a roll today,
aren't you?

30:53.373 --> 30:54.809
My family has flaws,

30:54.853 --> 30:56.071
just like anyone's--

30:56.115 --> 30:57.943
maybe even more--

30:57.986 --> 30:59.901
but I think this is one of them.

30:59.945 --> 31:01.685
That when we...

31:01.729 --> 31:03.905
give our word,

31:03.949 --> 31:07.430
we're foolish enough
to expect that trust in return.

31:08.910 --> 31:11.739
But you do what you got to do.

31:15.961 --> 31:17.788
Megan, pick up the phone.

31:17.832 --> 31:19.094
[phone ringing]

31:19.138 --> 31:20.879
Hello?DANNY:
Hey, Megan.

31:20.922 --> 31:22.881
It's Detective Reagan.
Where are you?

31:22.924 --> 31:24.099
I just got back to the hotel.

31:24.143 --> 31:25.709
I was just finishing up
some interviews.

31:25.753 --> 31:26.754
Okay, we're coming
to talk to you now.

31:26.797 --> 31:27.886
Don't go anywhere.

31:27.929 --> 31:30.584
What's going on, Detectives?

31:30.627 --> 31:32.194
Is everything okay?

31:32.238 --> 31:34.370
Just stay where you are.

31:34.414 --> 31:37.025
Who was that?

31:37.069 --> 31:40.550
Ralph, hi.

31:40.594 --> 31:42.248
That was my mom calling
to check in.

31:42.291 --> 31:45.468
Can we talk?
Okay.

31:45.512 --> 31:46.905
Just about the other night.

31:46.948 --> 31:48.297
I want to just
clear some things up.

31:48.341 --> 31:51.083
Okay. But not here.

31:51.126 --> 31:53.389
You want to go to my room?

31:53.433 --> 31:57.698
No. Let's get out of here
and go somewhere private.

31:57.741 --> 31:59.700
Get away from all this.

31:59.743 --> 32:01.006
Okay.

32:11.842 --> 32:12.931
You got my watch?

32:16.456 --> 32:17.631
You want to shoot a little?

32:17.674 --> 32:20.025
Thank you for getting
my watch back,

32:20.068 --> 32:21.287
but I gotta go.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.813
It wasn't Reggie who gave you
that black eye, was it?

32:29.730 --> 32:31.384
It was your older
brother, Dante.

32:31.427 --> 32:33.168
I don't know what
you're talking about.

32:33.212 --> 32:34.996
Reggie said you turned
on your own blood.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.217
And then I found your brother's
juvenile record.

32:38.260 --> 32:40.175
Our dad died from
a stray bullet.

32:40.219 --> 32:41.960
We each took it differently.

32:42.003 --> 32:43.265
I wanted to do everything

32:43.309 --> 32:44.527
to get out of
the neighborhood, but Dante...

32:44.571 --> 32:46.094
Fell in with some bad people?

32:46.138 --> 32:48.053
He was trying to be
the provider that we lost.

32:48.096 --> 32:50.925
Was he involved in
that assault and robbery?

32:50.969 --> 32:52.318
He is my brother.

32:52.361 --> 32:54.842
I am obligated
to give his name

32:54.885 --> 32:56.322
to the detectives
who caught the case.

32:56.365 --> 32:58.193
They'll check it against
the surveillance in the bodega,

32:58.237 --> 33:00.979
and if he was involved,
he'll be arrested.

33:03.024 --> 33:04.112
But you can still help him.

33:04.156 --> 33:05.853
How?!

33:05.896 --> 33:07.202
Get him to come in willingly.

33:07.246 --> 33:08.638
That way it'll be safer
for everyone involved.

33:08.682 --> 33:10.640
You want me to turn in
my own brother?

33:10.684 --> 33:12.599
I checked with my connection
at the D.A.

33:12.642 --> 33:14.166
If he comes in on his own,

33:14.209 --> 33:16.342
I can get him some leniency.

33:16.385 --> 33:19.171
Could you do it?

33:19.214 --> 33:21.782
To your own brother?

33:21.825 --> 33:24.263
If he'd almost killed
an innocent person,

33:24.306 --> 33:26.352
I would have to.

33:27.396 --> 33:30.399
Thank you
for getting my watch back.

33:32.575 --> 33:34.012
â™ª

33:41.062 --> 33:43.151
Hey, Mason.

33:43.195 --> 33:44.587
Where's Megan?

33:44.631 --> 33:46.894
I think she left already.Left where?

33:46.937 --> 33:48.939
How should I know?Was she alone?

33:48.983 --> 33:50.463
No. Ralph was with her.

33:50.506 --> 33:52.291
They were probably
just going for some drinks.Where?

33:52.334 --> 33:53.988
Like I said,
I have no idea.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.077
Well, you better
get an idea quick

33:56.121 --> 33:58.166
before another girl
turns up dead.You're joking.

33:58.210 --> 33:59.776
No, I'm not joking.

33:59.820 --> 34:01.256
Seriously, I don't know.

34:01.300 --> 34:03.258
Uh-huh. This Ralph,
he the kind of guy

34:03.302 --> 34:05.695
that keeps an apartment
on both coasts?

34:09.003 --> 34:10.613
[door bangs open]

34:10.657 --> 34:12.354
Megan!MEGAN:
What did you do?!

34:12.398 --> 34:13.921
All right.

34:13.964 --> 34:16.663
You, admit what you did to her.

34:16.706 --> 34:17.881
Okay, okay!
I-I admit it, okay?

34:17.925 --> 34:18.839
What did you do?!Please stop.

34:18.882 --> 34:20.232
What did you do?!Okay, please.

34:20.275 --> 34:23.104
I killed her, okay?
I killed her!

34:23.148 --> 34:24.149
[sobbing]Megan?

34:24.192 --> 34:26.107
[siren approaching]No.

34:26.151 --> 34:27.326
You can drop
the knife now.

34:27.369 --> 34:28.370
No.

34:28.414 --> 34:30.111
Yes.If I don't do this,

34:30.155 --> 34:31.939
nobody else will.

34:31.982 --> 34:34.072
That's not true.
We will put him away.

34:34.115 --> 34:37.684
It took Andrea dying
for anyone to even pay attention

34:37.727 --> 34:38.815
to this scumbag.

34:38.859 --> 34:41.905
I will not let him sit
on his throne

34:41.949 --> 34:43.081
one more day!

34:43.124 --> 34:44.952
DANNY:
Megan! Megan!

34:44.995 --> 34:46.127
Listen to me!

34:46.171 --> 34:47.128
Megan, stop!

34:48.042 --> 34:49.087
Stop right now!

34:49.130 --> 34:50.523
Look-it, he
already confessed.

34:50.566 --> 34:52.829
Okay?

34:52.873 --> 34:54.179
If you do this,

34:54.222 --> 34:55.702
it's not just Andrea's life
that's over,

34:55.745 --> 34:57.486
yours is over, too.

34:57.530 --> 34:59.227
Now, I'm gonna
put this away.

34:59.271 --> 35:00.663
I want you to drop

35:00.707 --> 35:02.012
that knife right now.

35:02.056 --> 35:03.405
Okay?

35:04.711 --> 35:05.886
Come on.

35:05.929 --> 35:07.453
[panting]

35:07.496 --> 35:08.454
Don't do it.

35:09.455 --> 35:10.586
No!

35:10.630 --> 35:12.545
[grunting]

35:12.588 --> 35:15.069
[Megan shouting indistinctly]

35:16.114 --> 35:17.289
DANNY:
Drop it.

35:18.246 --> 35:20.857
Drop it. Drop it![knife clatters to ground]

35:20.901 --> 35:23.164
Hands behind your back.

35:23.208 --> 35:25.079
[Megan crying]

35:25.123 --> 35:26.559
It was supposed to be me.

35:26.602 --> 35:27.560
I know.

35:27.603 --> 35:29.127
It's okay.

35:29.170 --> 35:30.519
Get that scumbag out of here.

35:32.565 --> 35:35.785
DANNY:
It wasn't supposed to be anyone.

35:35.829 --> 35:37.483
It wasn't supposed
to be anyone.

35:40.225 --> 35:41.748
[quietly]:
It's all right.

35:48.189 --> 35:49.973
Man, you went too far at
that bodega, beating that guy.

35:50.017 --> 35:51.758
Hey, man, when'd
you get all soft?I'm just saying

35:51.801 --> 35:53.716
I can't even take a leak without
the cops rolling up on me.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.153
Okay, I'll tell you what.

35:55.196 --> 35:58.286
Next time, I'll just ask
real nicely for the money.

35:58.330 --> 35:59.592
How's that sound?

35:59.635 --> 36:01.202
Put your bet up, man.[laughing]

36:01.246 --> 36:02.682
[door bangs open]What the...?

36:02.725 --> 36:04.901
Police! Don't move!

36:04.945 --> 36:06.468
Put your hands on the table!Man, what'd I tell you?

36:06.512 --> 36:08.514
Just shut up, man.Is that the guy?

36:08.557 --> 36:09.993
That's him.

36:10.037 --> 36:12.561
Dante Williams,
you're under arrest

36:12.605 --> 36:13.954
for robbery
and assault.

36:13.997 --> 36:15.869
Well, I-I didn't even do
anything, man!

36:15.912 --> 36:17.087
You maimed someone for life.

36:17.131 --> 36:18.306
Man, I...

36:19.307 --> 36:20.787
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

36:20.830 --> 36:22.484
You're that cop that Deon's
been hanging out with, right?

36:22.528 --> 36:24.834
Yeah. His "mentor."

36:24.878 --> 36:26.793
I heard how you look like.

36:26.836 --> 36:28.186
Look at you.

36:28.229 --> 36:30.884
You-you got my own brother
to turn on me?

36:30.927 --> 36:32.625
No, he wouldn't give you up.

36:33.669 --> 36:35.845
When you see him again...

36:35.889 --> 36:37.717
tell him he's dead to me.

36:37.760 --> 36:39.501
Get him out of here.

36:52.079 --> 36:54.212
You really said that to him?

36:54.255 --> 36:57.432
Yeah. Not my finest moment.

36:57.476 --> 36:59.391
Did he throw your ass out?

36:59.434 --> 37:01.393
No. I left in the nick of time.

37:01.436 --> 37:03.221
You know, there's no way
I would have asked you

37:03.264 --> 37:04.613
to go back a second time.

37:04.657 --> 37:05.832
That was my decision.

37:05.875 --> 37:08.922
I needed to finish
what I started.

37:09.966 --> 37:13.970
And I will never ask you
to do something like this again.

37:14.014 --> 37:16.103
Well, I don't really blame you.

37:16.146 --> 37:18.975
I didn't exactly
bring home the bacon.

37:19.019 --> 37:22.152
Hey, jury's still out.

37:22.196 --> 37:26.940
And I won't ask
unless I need you, and...

37:26.983 --> 37:28.942
then I will ask.

37:31.074 --> 37:33.599
So...

37:33.642 --> 37:36.079
when did you figure out
I didn't last this long

37:36.123 --> 37:37.820
by being a saint?

37:37.864 --> 37:41.128
Long before our lunch
the other day.

37:41.171 --> 37:43.130
Fair enough.

37:43.173 --> 37:46.002
And when did I figure out
you weren't a saint?

37:46.046 --> 37:47.961
[laughs]
Probably when I was six.

37:48.004 --> 37:50.180
Okay, an operator.

37:50.224 --> 37:51.791
When?

37:51.834 --> 37:54.446
The day you entered law school.

37:55.490 --> 37:58.711
But as long as it's
for the common good, right?

38:02.845 --> 38:04.717
Right.

38:05.761 --> 38:07.328
[sighs]:
Or at least...

38:07.372 --> 38:10.549
as long as we can still
convince ourselves it is.

38:12.377 --> 38:14.335
â™ª

38:24.954 --> 38:26.695
[dog barking in distance]

38:28.218 --> 38:29.959
You must be crazy
coming here

38:30.003 --> 38:31.047
after what you've done.

38:31.091 --> 38:32.701
Get the hell out.It's okay.

38:32.745 --> 38:34.268
You got one minute.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.965
Yeah.

38:40.927 --> 38:42.929
You shouldn't have come here.

38:42.972 --> 38:45.018
It's hard enough for her
as it is.

38:45.061 --> 38:46.933
I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

38:46.976 --> 38:48.326
Is Dante?

38:48.369 --> 38:51.285
I haven't spoken to him
since he was processed.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.939
What about your connection
with the D.A.?

38:52.982 --> 38:53.896
Can they still help him?

38:53.940 --> 38:55.942
That wasn't the deal, Deon.

38:55.985 --> 38:57.204
He's my brother.

38:57.247 --> 39:00.468
I couldn't just turn on him
like that.

39:02.427 --> 39:06.387
If you ever need anything,
don't hesitate to call.

39:06.431 --> 39:08.433
Unless it's to help
my brother, right?

39:11.131 --> 39:13.394
I'm sorry.

39:13.438 --> 39:15.440
â™ª

39:19.531 --> 39:21.489
[door closes]

39:24.840 --> 39:26.581
JANKO:
Wait a minute.

39:26.625 --> 39:28.888
So, what if you're
a Catholic

39:28.931 --> 39:31.673
and you give up something for
Lent that you don't like anyway?

39:31.717 --> 39:32.892
Well, that's not gonna work.

39:32.935 --> 39:34.850
Yeah.The whole point is sacrifice.

39:34.894 --> 39:36.243
Well, yeah, I get that.

39:36.286 --> 39:38.376
I'm just saying it'd be
really easy to game it.

39:41.204 --> 39:42.902
Game it how?Well,

39:42.945 --> 39:46.079
I could tell everybody
that I love anchovies...

39:46.122 --> 39:47.297
Mm-mm.ERIN:
No.

39:47.341 --> 39:48.951
No, we would know
you don't like anchovies.

39:48.995 --> 39:50.605
Yeah, we would see you
ordering anchovies

39:50.649 --> 39:52.433
on, like, a Caesar
salad or something.

39:52.477 --> 39:53.869
Okay, so not anchovies.

39:53.913 --> 39:55.697
What about, like... liver?

39:56.655 --> 39:58.091
No one likes liver.Nobody here knows

39:58.134 --> 40:00.485
if I love or
I hate liver.

40:00.528 --> 40:02.661
And it's never
been on the menu.

40:02.704 --> 40:05.141
Okay. That would be cheating.

40:05.185 --> 40:06.882
Yeah.You're looking

40:06.926 --> 40:08.449
for loopholes

40:08.493 --> 40:11.931
in a solemn
Christian tradition? Wow.

40:11.974 --> 40:14.020
It's not a l...

40:14.063 --> 40:16.457
The Lenten sacrifice requires
that we deny our body

40:16.501 --> 40:19.678
some luxury or pleasure for
the greater glory of God.

40:21.201 --> 40:22.550
That was very profound,
Monsignor.

40:22.594 --> 40:25.510
Five years
of catechism class.

40:25.553 --> 40:27.337
Five!I can tell.

40:27.381 --> 40:29.905
[Danny chuckles]

40:29.949 --> 40:31.559
It's not about
the anchovies.

40:31.603 --> 40:35.389
Okay, my point is that this is
a family of cops.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.782
And a prosecutor.

40:36.825 --> 40:40.089
You guys walk around all day
with an eye

40:40.133 --> 40:42.483
for a scam
and an ear for a fib.

40:42.527 --> 40:44.137
But when it comes to Lent,

40:44.180 --> 40:45.921
all of a sudden you
guys are all, like,

40:45.965 --> 40:49.142
whole-hog honor system?

40:49.185 --> 40:51.100
DANNY:
Yeah.
Yes.

40:51.144 --> 40:52.188
Yeah.

40:53.538 --> 40:55.017
Absolutely.

40:55.061 --> 40:56.149
It's the way we were raised.

40:56.192 --> 40:57.324
DANNY:
Yeah.

40:57.367 --> 40:59.544
I mean, I always try.

40:59.587 --> 41:01.023
JAMIE:
Although we did used
to check ourselves,

41:01.067 --> 41:04.070
growing up, around this table.

41:04.113 --> 41:07.073
And anchovies and liver
would never have cut it.

41:07.116 --> 41:08.814
Mm-mm.

41:08.857 --> 41:12.034
Well, when's the last time
you guys all checked each other?

41:12.078 --> 41:13.122
Excuse me?

41:13.166 --> 41:14.384
HENRY:
This Lent...

41:14.428 --> 41:18.780
I gave up
12-year-old Scotch whiskies.

41:18.824 --> 41:20.608
That's very specific.

41:20.652 --> 41:22.088
Crispy bacon.

41:22.131 --> 41:23.219
What?

41:23.263 --> 41:24.090
Mmm.

41:24.133 --> 41:25.221
My morning run.

41:25.265 --> 41:26.440
DANNY:
And I gave up,

41:26.484 --> 41:28.921
uh, trying to parent this one.

41:28.964 --> 41:30.009
[quiet laughter]

41:30.052 --> 41:31.097
Okay.

41:31.140 --> 41:32.707
JANKO:
Okay, I get it.

41:32.751 --> 41:35.275
The joke's on me, again.Eddie,

41:35.318 --> 41:38.670
it isn't a true sacrifice
unless you keep it to yourself.

41:38.713 --> 41:42.325
