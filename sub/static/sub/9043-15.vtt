WEBVTT

00:02.100 --> 00:03.233
- HEY, EVERYBODY.

00:03.233 --> 00:05.600
- HEY!
- HEY, HONEY.

00:05.600 --> 00:07.267
DID YOU HAVE FUN
AT MOLLY'S?

00:07.267 --> 00:09.000
- YEAH, SHE INVITED ME
TO HER BIRTHDAY PARTY.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.433
- OOH.
- DAVE'S GONNA BE THERE.

00:12.433 --> 00:15.100
- OH...
WHO'S DAVE?

00:15.100 --> 00:17.633
- DAVE YEAGER

00:17.633 --> 00:21.533
SHE'S ONLY HAD A CRUSH ON HIM
SINCE, LIKE, FOREVER.

00:21.533 --> 00:23.933
- DAVE. OKAY.

00:23.933 --> 00:27.467
I KNOW HIM AS DAV...ID.

00:27.467 --> 00:30.000
- WHOO, GET A LOAD
OF THIS STATIONERY!

00:30.000 --> 00:31.700
- OH, NICE.

00:31.700 --> 00:36.033
- OOH!
LET ME SEE.

00:36.033 --> 00:39.000
- QUIET, FRANK!

00:39.000 --> 00:43.700
- WOW, PEGGY'S HAVING MOLLY'S
PARTY AT THEIR COUNTRY CLUB.

00:43.700 --> 00:45.433
"FORMAL ATTIRE"?

00:45.433 --> 00:47.933
- A BLACK-TIE PARTY
FOR KIDS?

00:47.933 --> 00:48.967
- THAT'S NUTS.

00:48.967 --> 00:51.067
- THAT'S PEGGY.

00:51.067 --> 00:52.667
- PEGGY.

00:52.667 --> 00:57.533
HEY, RAY, ISN'T SHE THE COOKIE
LADY THAT BEAT YOU UP?

00:57.533 --> 01:02.700
- HEY, YEAH, THE COOKIE LADY,
SHE BEAT THE CHIPS OUT OF YOU.

01:08.900 --> 01:13.267
- I CAN'T WAIT TILL
ONE OF YOU TWO NEEDS A KIDNEY.

01:15.500 --> 01:19.833
- SHE'S EVEN PICKED OUT A GOWN
SHE WANTS THE GIRLS TO WEAR,

01:19.833 --> 01:22.033
AND TELLS US
WHERE TO BUY IT.

01:22.033 --> 01:27.367
- SOME WOMEN
ARE SO PUSHY.

01:27.367 --> 01:31.267
- "MENTION PEGGY'S NAME
TO GET A 10% DISCOUNT."

01:31.267 --> 01:34.967
- AND TO OPEN
THE GATES OF HELL.

01:34.967 --> 01:38.267
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS
FOR A KID'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

01:38.267 --> 01:40.733
WHAT HAPPENED
TO CAKE IN THE BACKYARD

01:40.733 --> 01:42.333
AND PLAYING HIDE AND SEEK?

01:42.333 --> 01:46.000
- THERE'S CAKE IN THE BACKYARD?

01:46.000 --> 01:47.933
- I WAS GREAT
AT HIDE AND SEEK.

01:47.933 --> 01:50.033
NOBODY EVER FOUND ME.

01:50.033 --> 01:53.133
- NOBODY LOOKED.

01:56.667 --> 01:59.633
- AMY IS RIGHT
ABOUT THESE PARTIES.

01:59.633 --> 02:03.733
I MEAN, TO HIRE PEOPLE
TO PLAY RECORDS,

02:03.733 --> 02:06.300
MAGICIANS, ENTERTAINMENT?

02:06.300 --> 02:07.967
WHEN I WAS A CHILD--

02:17.767 --> 02:19.267
- FORMAL ATTIRE PARTY
FOR KIDS--

02:19.933 --> 02:22.267
PEGGY'S A WACK-JOB.

02:22.267 --> 02:25.233
- NO, I MEAN,
I AGREE IT'S SILLY,

02:25.233 --> 02:27.233
BUT I UNDERSTAND HER WANTING
TO DO SOMETHING SPECIAL

02:27.233 --> 02:28.600
FOR MOLLY'S PARTY.

02:28.600 --> 02:33.367
I MEAN, 13 IS A MILESTONE AGE
FOR A GIRL.

02:33.367 --> 02:35.233
- YEAH, 13'S
A VERY BIG AGE.

02:35.233 --> 02:38.433
YOU'RE HALFWAY BETWEEN
GIRL AND WOMAN.

02:38.433 --> 02:40.633
YOUR BODY'S GOING THROUGH
ALL SORTS OF CHANGES.

02:40.633 --> 02:43.433
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
- I'M EATING.

02:43.433 --> 02:45.700
- OKAY.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.933
YOU KNOW, INTERESTINGLY,
IN MANY CULTURES,

02:49.933 --> 02:53.200
THE 13th BIRTHDAY
IS OFTEN CELEBRATED FORMALLY

02:53.200 --> 02:54.567
WITH LAVISH AFFAIRS.

02:54.567 --> 02:56.567
THE JEWISH PEOPLE,
FOR INSTANCE,

02:56.567 --> 03:00.000
HAVE THEIR
BAR OR BAT MITZVAH.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.900
SO, RAYMOND,
YOU COULD LOOK AT THIS

03:01.900 --> 03:04.800
AS MOLLY'S "BAT MITZVAH."

03:04.800 --> 03:06.500
- MM-HMM.

03:06.500 --> 03:12.433
COULD WE LOOK AT THIS
AS YOUR "SHUT-UPSVAH"?

03:12.433 --> 03:15.233
- OH. I KNOW THIS DRESS SHOP.

03:15.233 --> 03:16.633
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
WALK OUT OF THERE

03:16.633 --> 03:17.933
FOR LESS THAN $100.

03:17.933 --> 03:19.667
- $100.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.733
STUPID PEGGY.

03:22.733 --> 03:24.000
- YOU KNOW, DEBRA,

03:24.000 --> 03:25.533
YOU COULD SAVE YOURSELF
A LOT OF MONEY

03:25.533 --> 03:28.033
IF YOU MADE ALLY
A DRESS--

03:28.033 --> 03:31.033
OH...THAT'S RIGHT.

03:31.033 --> 03:32.933
WELL, I COULD MAKE HER
THE DRESS

03:32.933 --> 03:35.367
AND TELL HER
THAT YOU HELPED.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.267
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE
A DRESS, MA.

03:39.267 --> 03:40.400
OKAY, I STILL REMEMBER WHEN
YOU FORCED ME AND ROBERT

03:40.400 --> 03:44.167
TO WEAR YOUR HOMEMADE JEANS.

03:44.167 --> 03:45.967
- THEY WERE VERY NICE.

03:45.967 --> 03:49.633
THEY LOOKED JUST LIKE THE KIND
THE OTHER BOYS WERE WEARING.

03:49.633 --> 03:52.300
- THEY WERE VELVET.

03:56.033 --> 03:59.933
- THAT DENIM IS
VERY ABRASIVE.

03:59.933 --> 04:04.367
- YEAH, SO WERE
THE OTHER BOYS.

04:04.367 --> 04:06.533
- LISTEN, I APPRECIATE
YOUR OFFER, MARIE,

04:06.533 --> 04:08.933
BUT WE CAN AFFORD
TO BUY ALLY A DRESS.

04:08.933 --> 04:10.533
- NO, BUT I DON'T WANT
TO AFFORD IT, OKAY?

04:10.533 --> 04:14.100
$100 FOR A PARTY DRESS,
I MEAN, IT'S CRAZY.

04:14.100 --> 04:15.800
- MOM, WE GOT TO GET
TO THE MALL.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.833
I JUST TALKED TO JULIE, AND
SHE'S BUYING HER DRESS TODAY.

04:17.833 --> 04:19.667
SHE WANTS US TO MEET HER THERE,
SO LET'S GO.

04:19.667 --> 04:22.167
- HONEY, I HAVE A PTA MEETING,
SO YOUR FATHER CAN TAKE YOU.

04:22.167 --> 04:23.900
- WHAT, ME, WHOA.
WAIT A MINUTE.

04:23.900 --> 04:26.467
OKAY, LOOK, I DON'T EVEN--
- YOU WANT TO GO TO THE PTA?

04:28.567 --> 04:30.733
- COME ON, DAD. PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE?

04:30.733 --> 04:32.933
I WANT TO GET THERE BEFORE
ALL THE GOOD COLORS ARE GONE.

04:32.933 --> 04:35.067
I'LL BE IN THE CAR.

04:38.900 --> 04:41.367
- YOUR DAUGHTER IS WAITING.

04:43.833 --> 04:46.033
- [sighs]

04:46.033 --> 04:48.167
- GUY NEVER HAD
A CHANCE.

04:50.233 --> 04:51.733
- WHILE YOU'RE THERE,

04:51.733 --> 04:55.000
WHY DON'T YOU PICK UP
A DRESS FOR YOURSELF?

05:01.933 --> 05:04.967
- DAD, I DON'T THINK
YOU CAN BRING FOOD IN HERE.

05:04.967 --> 05:06.900
- HEY, I PAID FOUR BUCKS
FOR THIS COOKIE.

05:06.900 --> 05:09.300
I'M NOT GIVING IT UP.

05:09.300 --> 05:11.667
- I'M SORRY...
- HMM?

05:11.667 --> 05:13.600
- YOU CAN HAVE IT BACK
WHEN YOU LEAVE.

05:16.100 --> 05:17.367
- OKAY.

05:17.367 --> 05:19.100
I KNOW HOW MUCH I ATE.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.633
- NOW, MAY I HELP YOU?

05:22.633 --> 05:23.833
- UH, YEAH, UM,

05:23.833 --> 05:25.533
I NEED TO GET A DRESS
FOR MY DAUGHTER HERE.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.433
IT'S FOR
THE PEGGY ARDOLINO PARTY.

05:27.433 --> 05:31.000
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO MENTION HER NAME.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.633
- JUST FOLLOW ME.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.200
NOW, HERE WE ARE.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.433
THESE ARE THE DRESSES
FOR THE ARDOLINO PARTY.

05:36.433 --> 05:39.067
- WOW, DADDY,
LOOK AT THEM.

05:39.067 --> 05:40.833
- YEAH.
- THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

05:40.833 --> 05:42.100
- YEAH, YEAH.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.400
YOU CAN WEAR THEM
TO A FORMAL PARTY

05:43.400 --> 05:46.767
OR JUST KNOCKING
AROUND THE HOUSE.

05:46.767 --> 05:48.033
WHICH COLOR YOU WANT?

05:48.033 --> 05:49.567
- THE BLUE.

05:49.567 --> 05:50.833
- HM. BEAUTIFUL.

05:50.833 --> 05:52.067
HOW MUCH IS IT?

05:52.067 --> 05:56.100
- THESE DRESSES ARE $250.

05:56.100 --> 05:58.867
- $250?

05:58.867 --> 06:00.100
- I'LL BE IN THERE.

06:00.100 --> 06:02.000
- NO, WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.667
$250?

06:04.667 --> 06:07.433
- THAT'S WITH THE 10% DISCOUNT
FOR MENTIONING PEGGY'S NAME.

06:07.433 --> 06:09.200
- ALL RIGHT, PEGGY, PEGGY,
PEGGY, PEGGY, PEGGY.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.500
HOW MUCH IS IT NOW?

06:15.500 --> 06:18.667
- HEY, BARONE, YOU GOT ROPED
INTO THIS TOO, HUH?

06:18.667 --> 06:20.667
- JERRY, YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH THIS DRESS IS?

06:20.667 --> 06:21.800
IT'S $250.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.567
- I KNOW.
I WAS GONNA GET A LAWNMOWER.

06:26.933 --> 06:28.000
- ARE YOU GONNA PAY FOR IT?

06:28.000 --> 06:29.233
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

06:29.233 --> 06:30.567
I THINK THE PARENTS
SHOULD PROTEST

06:30.567 --> 06:32.500
AND REFUSE
TO BUY THIS FANCY CRAP.

06:32.500 --> 06:35.767
OKAY, IT WOULD JUST TEACH PEGGY
THAT SHE'S NOT THE BOSS OF US.

06:35.767 --> 06:37.833
- OR GET US ALL KILLED.

06:37.833 --> 06:41.233
I HEARD SHE ONCE BEAT UP A GUY
OVER SOME COOKIES.

06:43.900 --> 06:46.967
- REALLY? NO, I HEARD
THAT HE BEAT HER UP, ACTUALLY.

06:46.967 --> 06:48.833
YEAH...BAD.

06:48.833 --> 06:50.333
- SIR,

06:50.333 --> 06:52.767
WOULD YOU LIKE YOUR DAUGHTER
TO TRY ON THE DRESS?

06:52.767 --> 06:54.700
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

06:54.700 --> 06:57.433
DON'T YOU THINK THAT
THIS IS AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY

06:57.433 --> 06:59.167
TO SPEND ON A ONE-TIME THING?

06:59.167 --> 07:02.700
- THAT'S NOT FOR ME TO SAY, SIR,
BUT HOW CAN YOU PUT A PRICE

07:02.700 --> 07:06.733
ON THE SMILE OF THIS
BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN?

07:10.167 --> 07:16.367
- YOU WORK ON COMMISSION,
DON'T YOU?

07:16.367 --> 07:17.767
- ALLY.

07:17.767 --> 07:19.367
- HEY, MOLLY.

07:19.367 --> 07:21.133
- MOLLY?

07:26.367 --> 07:29.067
- HELLO, ALLY'S DAD.

07:29.067 --> 07:33.700
- HELLO, PEGGY.

07:33.700 --> 07:35.533
- IS THERE A PROBLEM?

07:37.500 --> 07:40.133
- ALLY, WOULD YOU
GIVE US A MINUTE, OKAY?

07:40.133 --> 07:41.400
WHY DON'T
YOU AND MOLLY GO DOWN

07:41.400 --> 07:42.867
AND TAKE TURNS
ON THE MASSAGE CHAIR.

07:42.867 --> 07:45.100
GO AHEAD.

07:48.300 --> 07:50.233
PEGGY, PEGGY, LISTEN.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.400
JERRY, JERRY, COME HERE.

07:56.267 --> 07:59.267
SOME OF US--
SOME OF US ARE WONDERING,

07:59.267 --> 08:01.133
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

08:01.133 --> 08:04.067
I MEAN, A FORMAL PARTY
FOR 13-YEAR-OLDS?

08:04.067 --> 08:05.967
YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND
ABOUT MILESTONES

08:05.967 --> 08:09.900
AND BODIES GOING THROUGH
WEIRD HORMONALS,

08:09.900 --> 08:13.533
BUT YOU'RE NOT
EVEN JEWISH.

08:13.533 --> 08:16.800
- I JUST THOUGHT
IT MIGHT BE FUN FOR ONE NIGHT

08:16.800 --> 08:18.533
IF ALL THE KIDS
LOOKED NICE.

08:18.533 --> 08:20.367
I'M JUST SICK
OF THE BELLY SHIRTS

08:20.367 --> 08:23.067
AND THE THONGS STICKING OUT
OF JEANS CUT DOWN TO HERE.

08:23.067 --> 08:26.133
- WELL, HEY, LISTEN, I DON'T
LIKE STUFF LIKE THAT ON GIRLS

08:26.133 --> 08:28.733
UNDER 21, EITHER, OKAY?

08:30.800 --> 08:33.533
BUT...ALLY--ALLY DOESN'T
DRESS LIKE THAT.

08:33.533 --> 08:35.567
AND--AND JERRY AND I THINK
THAT IT'S OUTRAGEOUS

08:35.567 --> 08:37.833
TO EXPECT PEOPLE TO PAY
THAT MUCH.

08:37.833 --> 08:40.733
- OH, LOOK AT
THE JEWELRY.

08:46.300 --> 08:48.333
- WHY ARE YOU MAKING
SUCH A BIG DEAL OUT OF THIS?

08:48.333 --> 08:51.567
YOU'RE A SPORTSWRITER.
YOU MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.

08:51.567 --> 08:53.167
- NO...

08:53.167 --> 08:55.267
I WRITE ABOUT PEOPLE
THAT MAKE A LOT OF MONEY,

08:55.267 --> 08:56.567
AND THAT'S NOT THE POINT,
OKAY?

08:56.567 --> 08:58.167
WHAT I MAKE IS NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

08:58.167 --> 08:59.533
I STILL THINK
THAT THIS WHOLE THING IS NUTS.

08:59.533 --> 09:01.700
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.
DON'T BUY THE DRESS.

09:01.700 --> 09:04.000
AND YOU CAN EXPLAIN
TO ALLY WHY SHE WILL BE

09:04.000 --> 09:06.200
THE ONLY GIRL THERE
WITHOUT ONE.

09:06.200 --> 09:09.067
SHE WILL STICK OUT
LIKE A GIANT NOSE

09:09.067 --> 09:11.167
ON A STUPID FACE.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.733
- HEY, CAN I TRY ON
THE DRESS NOW, DADDY?

09:18.733 --> 09:20.200
- COME ON, ALLY.
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.400
- BUT WHY, DAD?
WHAT ABOUT THE DRESS?

09:22.400 --> 09:24.433
- WE'RE NOT GONNA BUY IT. GO.
- BUT, DAD.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.200
- COME ON. NOW.
- WHY?

09:26.200 --> 09:27.767
- BECAUSE I SAID SO.
- BUT WHY?

09:27.767 --> 09:29.100
- BECAUSE I AM THE GROWN-UP,
AND THAT'S HOW IT IS.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.700
NOW, WHERE IS MY COOKIE?

09:30.700 --> 09:32.067
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.

09:32.067 --> 09:35.133
COME ON, ALLY.

09:43.367 --> 09:45.867
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
BE LIKE THAT.

09:45.867 --> 09:47.233
[door slams]

09:48.433 --> 09:50.800
- RAY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:50.800 --> 09:53.267
- GUESS HOW MUCH
THE DRESS COST, GO AHEAD.

09:53.267 --> 09:55.133
- I DON'T KNOW.
LIKE $100?

09:55.133 --> 09:58.033
- EHH! GUESS AGAIN!

09:58.033 --> 09:59.367
JUST--JUST TELL ME, RAY.

09:59.367 --> 10:02.033
- $120.
- EHH! EHH!

10:02.033 --> 10:03.667
- RAY, KNOCK IT OFF.

10:03.667 --> 10:07.933
- $147.99.

10:07.933 --> 10:10.767
- WRONG.

10:10.767 --> 10:13.833
$250.

10:13.833 --> 10:17.600
- YES! I WAS CLOSEST!

10:17.600 --> 10:20.767
- WOW, TWO HUNDRED AND--
WHY SO MUCH?

10:20.767 --> 10:21.900
- I DON'T KNOW.

10:21.900 --> 10:25.533
MAYBE IT'S MADE
OF UNICORN FUR.

10:27.700 --> 10:30.967
- SO WAIT.
YOU--YOU DIDN'T BUY IT?

10:30.967 --> 10:32.567
- NO, OF COURSE NOT.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

10:32.567 --> 10:33.633
YOU WOULD'VE?

10:33.633 --> 10:37.400
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK I WOULD HAVE.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.567
- WHAT?
- WAIT, I MEAN, I AGREE WITH YOU

10:39.567 --> 10:41.133
THAT IT COSTS
TOO MUCH MONEY.

10:41.133 --> 10:42.733
- 250 BUCKS?

10:42.733 --> 10:46.467
YOU COULD PUT A GREAT TV
IN THE BATHROOM FOR THAT.

10:46.467 --> 10:51.033
- YOU ARE NOT GETTING A TV
IN THE BATHROOM.

10:51.033 --> 10:55.700
- THEN I'M BRINGING THE TOILET
INTO THE LIVING ROOM.

10:58.967 --> 11:01.400
- PLEASE, PLEASE.
JUST STOP.

11:01.400 --> 11:03.500
RAY, LISTEN,
ALLY STILL NEEDS THAT DRESS.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.700
SHE'S GOING TO BE
THE ONLY GIRL NOT WEARING ONE.

11:05.700 --> 11:07.000
SHE'LL STAND OUT.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.700
- OH, OKAY, SO NOW YOU'RE
JUST LIKE PEGGY NOW.

11:09.700 --> 11:14.267
- OH, SO THIS IS ALL
BECAUSE YOU HATE PEGGY.

11:14.267 --> 11:16.333
- NO, NO, THIS HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH HER.

11:16.333 --> 11:19.533
IT'S MORALLY
AND ETHNICALLY WRONG.

11:21.667 --> 11:24.200
- YOU'RE OUT OF
YOUR ELEMENT, RAY.

11:24.200 --> 11:27.300
- LOOK, ALLY'S
STILL GONNA LOOK NICE.

11:27.300 --> 11:29.400
OKAY, WE'LL BUY HER A NICE,
NORMAL-PRICED DRESS.

11:29.400 --> 11:30.900
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS.

11:30.900 --> 11:33.800
- BECAUSE YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN
A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.633
- I THINK YOU'RE REALLY
RUNNING OUT OF STUFF

11:36.633 --> 11:39.967
TO CRITICIZE ME FOR.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.200
- YOU KNOW, DEBRA,

11:41.200 --> 11:42.767
I KNOW THAT YOU
WERE RAISED IN A HOUSE

11:42.767 --> 11:44.300
WHERE MONEY WAS NO OBJECT.

11:44.300 --> 11:47.567
BUT DO YOU REALLY WANT
TO PASS ON THESE VALUES

11:47.567 --> 11:49.500
TO YOUR CHILDREN?

11:49.500 --> 11:52.000
- SHE'S RIGHT. LOOK,
I FEEL SORRY FOR ALLY TOO,

11:52.000 --> 11:53.300
BUT ISN'T IT MORE IMPORTANT

11:53.300 --> 11:54.800
THAT WE DON'T RAISE
SPOILED KIDS?

11:54.800 --> 11:57.167
- YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT
TO IMPRESS YOUR MOTHER.

11:57.167 --> 12:02.300
- AND HE HAS.

12:02.300 --> 12:04.000
- HI.
- HEY.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.233
- OH, THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.

12:05.233 --> 12:06.733
I NEED YOU
TO SETTLE AN ARGUMENT.

12:06.733 --> 12:09.400
- I REALLY JUST WANTED
TO RETURN YOUR ROASTING PAN.

12:09.400 --> 12:12.100
- THAT'S OKAY.
THIS'LL JUST TAKE A SECOND.

12:12.100 --> 12:15.733
- SHOULD'VE JUST
MAILED THE PAN.

12:15.733 --> 12:17.700
- RAY DOESN'T WANT
TO BUY ALLY THE PARTY DRESS

12:17.700 --> 12:19.500
BECAUSE HE THINKS
IT COSTS TOO MUCH.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.167
- AND I AGREE WITH RAYMOND.

12:21.167 --> 12:26.300
- AH, MA AGREES WITH RAYMOND.
THAT'S 40 YEARS IN A ROW.

12:34.467 --> 12:36.533
- I-I'D SAY THAT THE DRESS
IS TOO EXPENSIVE,

12:36.533 --> 12:39.300
BUT ISN'T IT MORE IMPORTANT
THAT ALLY IS NOT THE ONLY GIRL

12:39.300 --> 12:41.400
AT THE PARTY
NOT WEARING THE DRESS?

12:41.400 --> 12:43.700
- OH, YEAH.
THAT WOULD BE HUMILIATING.

12:43.700 --> 12:46.200
- I AGREE WITH MY WIFE.
LET'S GO. GOOD-BYE.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.933
- HOLD IT.

12:47.933 --> 12:51.267
IT COSTS $250.

12:56.267 --> 12:58.867
- FOR A DRESS THAT
WILL ONLY BE WORN ONCE?

12:58.867 --> 13:00.700
- YEAH, HMM-HMM HAH.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.200
- THAT'S
AWFULLY EXPENSIVE.

13:06.200 --> 13:10.700
- YEAH, WELL, TELL IT
TO DEBRA VON MONEYBAGS.

13:12.800 --> 13:15.600
- YOU KNOW, I NEVER LIKE
TO AGREE WITH A MORON,

13:15.600 --> 13:19.500
BUT I'VE GOT TO GO
WITH RAYMOND ON THIS ONE.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.733
- HEY, DEB, I'LL BACK YOU

13:20.733 --> 13:25.267
IF YOU BACK MY
"TV IN THE TOILET" IDEA.

13:25.267 --> 13:27.733
- IT'S OKAY, FRANK.

13:27.733 --> 13:29.400
THIS IS A--

13:29.400 --> 13:32.500
AM I THE ONLY ONE
THAT FEELS THIS WAY?

13:35.567 --> 13:37.700
ALL RIGHT.

13:37.700 --> 13:39.600
[sighs]
ALLY!

13:39.600 --> 13:42.300
YOUR FATHER AND I
NEED TO TALK TO YOU!

13:42.300 --> 13:45.567
- NOW, REMEMBER, YOU TWO
HAVE TO STAND FIRM AND UNITED.

13:45.567 --> 13:47.700
- EVEN WHEN SHE SAYS
SHE HATES YOU.

13:47.700 --> 13:49.567
- NO, LOOK,

13:49.567 --> 13:51.467
ALLY DOESN'T
SAY THAT TO US.

13:51.467 --> 13:54.433
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
YOU WANT THAT HATE.

13:54.433 --> 13:58.433
IF YOUR KIDS LIKE YOU,
YOU'VE FAILED AS PARENTS.

14:02.667 --> 14:07.300
- ALLOW ME TO CONGRATULATE YOU
ON YOUR MAGNIFICENT SUCCESS.

14:16.700 --> 14:19.767
- ALLY, HONEY, LISTEN.

14:19.767 --> 14:22.167
WE'VE BEEN HAVING A LONG TALK
ABOUT THIS WHOLE DRESS THING,

14:22.167 --> 14:26.300
AND I THINK YOUR FATHER
WAS RIGHT NOT TO BUY IT.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.400
- I MEAN, WE JUST CAN'T SPEND
THAT MUCH MONEY

14:28.400 --> 14:31.467
AND STILL FEEL LIKE
WE'RE BEING GOOD PARENTS.

14:33.433 --> 14:36.400
- CAN I GO BACK
TO MY ROOM NOW?

14:36.400 --> 14:39.067
- YEAH,
BUT FIRST I WANT YOU

14:39.067 --> 14:42.967
TO MAKE UP WITH
YOUR FATHER, OKAY?

14:42.967 --> 14:45.200
COME ON, HONEY.

14:45.200 --> 14:48.267
- I'M SORRY WE FOUGHT,
SWEETIE.

15:17.867 --> 15:19.133
SEE?

15:19.133 --> 15:21.500
SHE DIDN'T SAY
SHE HATES ME.

15:21.500 --> 15:24.300
- DON'T WORRY.
SHE WAS THINKING IT.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.767
[knocking]

15:30.767 --> 15:32.533
- ALLY?

15:34.700 --> 15:35.800
HEY...

15:35.800 --> 15:37.333
IT'S 6:30.

15:37.333 --> 15:39.267
SHOULDN'T YOU BE GETTING READY
FOR THE PARTY?

15:39.267 --> 15:40.800
- I'M NOT GOING.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.833
- LOOK, I KNOW YOU'VE
BEEN SAYING ALL WEEK

15:43.833 --> 15:45.000
THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING,

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
BUT MOLLY
IS YOUR BEST FRIEND,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.300
AND YOU TOLD HER
THAT YOU WOULD BE THERE.

15:49.300 --> 15:51.133
- WELL, I'M NOT GOING.

15:51.133 --> 15:53.100
- BECAUSE OF THE DRESS?

15:55.067 --> 15:57.567
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

15:57.567 --> 15:59.533
STUPID QUESTION.

15:59.533 --> 16:01.267
COME ON, LOOK,

16:01.267 --> 16:03.733
AREN'T ALL YOUR FRIENDS
GOING TO BE THERE, HUH?

16:03.733 --> 16:07.400
AND THAT GUY THAT YOU'VE HAD
A CRUSH ON FOR, LIKE, FOREVER...

16:07.400 --> 16:10.600
CHARLIE.

16:10.600 --> 16:11.833
- DAVE.

16:11.833 --> 16:13.733
- DAVE, RIGHT.

16:13.733 --> 16:17.900
DAVE.

16:17.900 --> 16:20.100
COME ON, DON'T YOU
WANT TO BE WITH YOUR FRIENDS

16:20.100 --> 16:21.600
AND--AND DANCE WITH DAVE

16:21.600 --> 16:24.100
ON FAST SONGS ONLY?

16:24.100 --> 16:26.167
- STOP IT, DAD.

16:28.667 --> 16:31.767
- LISTEN...

16:31.767 --> 16:33.133
I KNOW YOU AND MOM WERE RIGHT

16:33.133 --> 16:36.067
ABOUT THE DRESS BEING
TOO EXPENSIVE.

16:36.067 --> 16:38.033
- REALLY?

16:38.033 --> 16:40.767
WOW. WELL, GOOD.

16:40.767 --> 16:44.800
SEE? I'M GLAD
YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.733
- WELL...YEAH.

16:46.733 --> 16:50.000
I MEAN, I THINK
THE WHOLE "FANCY PARTY" IDEA

16:50.000 --> 16:51.300
IS KIND OF DUMB.

16:51.300 --> 16:54.867
SO DOES MOLLY,
BUT HER MOM'S JUST SO...

16:54.867 --> 16:59.900
- HORRIBLE, YEAH.

16:59.900 --> 17:02.067
- I WAS GONNA SAY EXCITED.

17:02.067 --> 17:04.000
- OH.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.367
YEAH, I MEANT
HORRIBLY EXCITED.

17:12.167 --> 17:16.433
- I'M SORRY I WAS MAD
AT YOU, DADDY.

17:16.433 --> 17:18.967
- WERE YOU MAD AT ME?
OH.

17:18.967 --> 17:22.233
I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE.

17:24.600 --> 17:28.367
- I JUST WANT THIS PARTY
TO BE OVER AND DONE WITH.

17:28.367 --> 17:30.567
DO YOU WANT TO GO
WATCH A MOVIE?

17:30.567 --> 17:33.633
- NOT WITH YOU.

17:35.533 --> 17:38.067
YOU'RE GOING TO THAT PARTY.

17:38.067 --> 17:40.667
- BUT I TOLD YOU
I'M NOT GOING.

17:40.667 --> 17:43.767
- WELL, THEN WHAT
AM I GONNA DO WITH THIS?

17:46.967 --> 17:50.000
- OH, MY GOD.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.767
I PROMISE I'LL DO
LOTS OF CHORES TO PAY FOR IT.

17:52.767 --> 17:55.867
I'LL...WASH YOUR CAR
AND BABY-SIT.

17:55.867 --> 17:58.000
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU DON'T GOT TO DO ANY OF THAT.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.800
JUST GO.
GO AND HAVE A GOOD TIME.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.133
- WHY'D YOU BUY IT?

18:01.133 --> 18:03.633
- I BOUGHT IT--
I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE...

18:03.633 --> 18:06.567
I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE
YOU'RE A GOOD KID,

18:06.567 --> 18:08.033
AND YOU DON'T ASK
FOR MUCH,

18:08.033 --> 18:10.967
AND I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW

18:10.967 --> 18:15.067
THAT YOU CAN COUNT ON ME
TO DO STUFF

18:15.067 --> 18:17.533
WHEN IT'S IMPORTANT
FOR YOU.

18:19.900 --> 18:21.967
- THANKS.

18:21.967 --> 18:23.800
- YOU KNOW,

18:23.800 --> 18:25.333
I WAS GONNA GET YOU
THE DRESS ANYWAY,

18:25.333 --> 18:27.333
BUT YOU MADE IT
A LOT EASIER

18:27.333 --> 18:31.567
WHEN YOU SAID THAT $250
IS A LOT OF MONEY.

18:31.567 --> 18:33.933
- HEY, MOM,
LOOK WHAT DADDY BOUGHT ME.

18:33.933 --> 18:37.733
- OH, YEAH,
ACTUALLY...

18:37.733 --> 18:39.333
SEE...

18:43.100 --> 18:46.100
IT'S ACTUALLY--
IT'S FROM BOTH OF US.

18:46.100 --> 18:47.267
- THANKS, MOM.

18:47.267 --> 18:49.933
- YEAH, HONEY,
YOU'RE WELCOME.

18:49.933 --> 18:54.000
- I'M GONNA GO TRY IT ON.
YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST.

18:57.900 --> 18:59.200
- WHAT?

18:59.200 --> 19:00.800
- LOOK AT YOU...

19:00.800 --> 19:03.633
AFTER ALL YOUR TOUGH TALK,
YOU TURN INTO A PUDDLE OF GOO.

19:03.633 --> 19:05.400
- NO. NO.
- YEAH.

19:05.400 --> 19:06.700
YOU'RE SO WORRIED
SHE'S GONNA HATE YOU,

19:06.700 --> 19:08.800
YOU JUST FOLD
LIKE A CHEAP TENT.

19:08.800 --> 19:10.900
- NO. NO. I'M--

19:10.900 --> 19:13.900
I'M TOUGH BUT FAIR, YEAH.

19:13.900 --> 19:16.400
MAINLY TOUGH.

19:16.400 --> 19:19.800
- CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND?

19:19.800 --> 19:22.733
YOU HAD ME THINKING
THAT YOU WERE RIGHT FOR ONCE.

19:22.733 --> 19:24.767
AND I WAS HATING MYSELF

19:24.767 --> 19:27.400
'CAUSE I WAS GETTING ALL SUCKED
INTO THIS SUPERFICIAL CRAP

19:27.400 --> 19:30.300
ABOUT FITTING IN
AND LOOKS AND FASHION.

19:30.300 --> 19:31.533
AND I'M THINKING, "GEE,

19:31.533 --> 19:32.767
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE RAY REALLY HAS"--

19:32.767 --> 19:36.267
OH. LOOK AT THIS DRESS!

19:36.267 --> 19:39.100
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.
THAT IS JUST GORGEOUS.

19:39.100 --> 19:40.933
YOU'RE SO GROWN UP.

19:40.933 --> 19:43.233
WANT ME TO DO YOUR HAIR?
- YES, I WOULD LOVE THAT.

19:43.233 --> 19:44.433
CAN I USE YOUR MAKEUP?

19:44.433 --> 19:45.800
- LITTLE BLUSH?
JUST A LITTLE BLUSH.

19:45.800 --> 19:48.100
AND I HAVE A BAG THAT
IS SO PERFECT FOR THIS.

19:48.100 --> 19:51.867
- HMPH...

20:04.233 --> 20:06.267
- OKAY, HONEY.
HAVE A GOOD TIME AT THE PARTY.

20:06.867 --> 20:08.300
- LISTEN, REMEMBER--

20:08.300 --> 20:10.433
A DANCE MAY START FAST
BUT THEN GOES SLOW,

20:10.433 --> 20:14.567
SO YOU JUST SAY,
"NO, THANK YOU," THEN WALK AWAY.

20:14.567 --> 20:16.533
- SURE, DAD.
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

20:19.633 --> 20:22.900
[chattering]

20:22.900 --> 20:25.067
OH, MY GOD.

20:25.067 --> 20:27.633
NOBODY ELSE
IS WEARING THE DRESS.

20:30.133 --> 20:32.533
- NICE DRESS,
CINDERELLA.

20:32.533 --> 20:36.167
[girls laugh]

20:36.167 --> 20:38.633
- WELL, IF IT ISN'T
ALLY'S DAD.

20:38.633 --> 20:42.233
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'VE RUINED
MY DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

20:42.233 --> 20:43.567
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

20:43.567 --> 20:45.067
PLEASE, DON'T PLAY DUMB
WITH ME.

20:45.067 --> 20:47.167
ALL YOUR RABBLE-ROUSING
IN THE DRESS SHOP?

20:47.167 --> 20:49.733
- YOU WERE RABBLE-ROUSING?
- NO.

20:49.733 --> 20:51.767
- HE TOLD MEGAN'S FATHER
ALL THE PARENTS SHOULD PROTEST

20:51.767 --> 20:53.667
AND REFUSE TO BUY
THE FORMAL CLOTHES.

20:53.667 --> 20:57.500
THEY ALL CALLED EACH OTHER,
AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED.

21:05.267 --> 21:08.667
- NOBODY CALLED ME.

21:08.667 --> 21:11.600
- WE HAVE TO GO HOME.
- NO, HONEY.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.567
- ALLY, LOOK, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT ANYBODY ELSE SAYS.

21:13.567 --> 21:15.700
GO IN THERE AND HAVE
A WONDERFUL TIME.

21:15.700 --> 21:17.833
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THIS TO ME, DAD.

21:17.833 --> 21:19.900
- WH-WHAT DID I DO?
I DID SOMETHING NICE.

21:19.900 --> 21:23.133
I BOUGHT A DRESS FOR $250.
YOU'RE GOING INTO THAT PARTY.

21:23.133 --> 21:25.700
- NO, I'M NOT.
- YES, YOU ARE. $250.

21:25.700 --> 21:27.633
- I DON'T CARE.
- YOU'RE GOING INTO THE PARTY.

21:27.633 --> 21:29.433
- YOU CAN'T MAKE ME.
- LOOK, I'M YOUR FATHER.

21:29.433 --> 21:31.267
YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT I SAY.
- WELL, I HATE YOU!

21:40.833 --> 21:43.433
- CONGRATULATIONS.

21:48.300 --> 21:51.600
YOU'RE A SUCCESSFUL PARENT.
