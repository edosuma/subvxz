00:00.094 --> 00:01.914
(Woman) Previously on "Finding Carter".

00:01.952 --> 00:03.929
(Woman) When you were three
years old, you were abducted

00:03.953 --> 00:05.663
your real parents are here.

00:05.688 --> 00:07.915
- Do you remember me at all?
- No, I'm sorry.

00:07.939 --> 00:09.885
Your family, you like 'em?

00:09.910 --> 00:11.166
(Carter) They're total strangers.

00:11.191 --> 00:12.065
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:12.090 --> 00:14.281
- (Carter) Mom...
- I'm sorry.

00:14.306 --> 00:16.290
There are things you don't
know, things you should know.

00:16.315 --> 00:19.510
You looked into my eyes
and lied to my face.

00:19.535 --> 00:21.035
(Carter) Come on, you like Max, right?

00:21.060 --> 00:21.957
(Taylor) Yeah, a lot.

00:21.982 --> 00:23.340
I wish I could've been your first.

00:23.365 --> 00:25.379
- Who's that?
- That is a blond-haired,

00:25.404 --> 00:26.677
blue-eyed piece of raw sewage.

00:26.702 --> 00:28.263
And you can never have
anything to do with him again.

00:28.288 --> 00:30.615
- Do you understand me?!
- Do you understand me?

00:30.640 --> 00:32.101
No-no-no, I can't, I can't do this.

00:32.125 --> 00:33.889
Not unless you tell me
it's over with David.

00:33.915 --> 00:36.132
Your husband knows that you
and I are having an affair.

00:36.157 --> 00:38.765
We are going to be together.

00:38.790 --> 00:40.757
Meet me here tomorrow night.

00:40.782 --> 00:42.145
(Carter) I don't know what I want.

00:42.169 --> 00:44.265
Carter asked me to say good-bye for her.

00:44.290 --> 00:45.712
Don't underestimate me, David.

00:45.737 --> 00:47.056
<i>You made that mistake once before.</i>

00:47.081 --> 00:48.486
(Carter) If you don't divorce Elizabeth,

00:48.510 --> 00:49.790
then I will let you write your book.

00:49.815 --> 00:52.878
Everything he told me
was a l... Oh, my God!

00:52.903 --> 00:55.189
- (Elizabeth) She left with him?
- Whoo!

00:55.214 --> 00:56.581
Give us everything in the register.

00:56.606 --> 00:58.019
Report it as a robbery.

00:58.043 --> 00:59.409
Crash, what the hell are you doing?

00:59.434 --> 01:00.971
- The safety's on.
- (Gunshot)

01:00.996 --> 01:03.339
- Call 9-1-1!
- Oh, my God.

01:03.364 --> 01:05.147
- You're under arrest.
- Crash!

01:05.172 --> 01:06.221
Get her away from here!

01:06.246 --> 01:07.653
I knew you were gonna follow me

01:07.677 --> 01:08.668
'cause you're my mom.

01:08.693 --> 01:10.207
You spent three months with them.

01:10.232 --> 01:12.515
How does that wipe out 13 years with me?

01:12.540 --> 01:13.910
It was all based on a lie.

01:13.935 --> 01:15.832
Max, I'm scared you're breaking up with me.

01:15.857 --> 01:16.689
I am.

01:16.714 --> 01:18.582
Stalkers are crazy people.

01:18.607 --> 01:20.137
I was raised by your stalker?

01:20.162 --> 01:22.098
- Oh, I didn't order this.
- It's from your mother.

01:22.123 --> 01:25.624
(Voice echoing) Oh, baby,
you do not look at all well.

01:25.649 --> 01:28.650
You didn't belong with those
people. You belong with me.

01:28.675 --> 01:30.206
The girl that was sitting
here, where'd she go?

01:30.231 --> 01:31.384
(Waiter) She left with her mom.

01:31.409 --> 01:33.483
Carter!

01:53.805 --> 01:56.405

wanna play a game of pretend?

01:56.430 --> 01:58.106
Shh.

Look, you...

02:27.892 --> 02:29.541
you knew eventually it would come to this.

02:29.566 --> 02:30.732
The truth has to come out.

It's too late to turn back now.

I don't get it.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.859
There's nothing on the news
about Carter being taken.

03:34.892 --> 03:36.017
No Amber alert either.

03:36.489 --> 03:38.322
It's been four hours.

03:38.347 --> 03:39.646
Hey, maybe you could text your dad

03:39.671 --> 03:41.178
and see if he's heard anything.

03:41.203 --> 03:43.164
Yeah, definitely.

03:44.584 --> 03:47.063
It's a media blackout.

03:47.897 --> 03:48.827
What are you doing here?

03:48.852 --> 03:49.827
Shouldn't you be home?

03:49.852 --> 03:51.352
Everyone's just sitting around,

03:51.377 --> 03:54.578
staring at each other, waiting
to hear from my mom, it's awful.

03:57.545 --> 04:00.259
Is it okay... that I'm here?

04:00.284 --> 04:02.850
Yeah, of course it's okay.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.959
'Cause I know that we're broken up

04:04.984 --> 04:07.023
- and stuff, but...
- You guys are broken up?

04:07.048 --> 04:09.648
- Uh, bird...
- When did this happen?

04:09.673 --> 04:11.376
Maybe we should go get some snacks.

04:11.401 --> 04:13.017
- Yeah, snacks.
- Snacks?

04:13.042 --> 04:15.117
This seems like the time to get snacks?

04:21.797 --> 04:23.414
I'm sorry.

04:23.439 --> 04:24.688
For what?

04:24.713 --> 04:28.559
Being here, it feels awkward, considering.

04:28.584 --> 04:31.138
No, I'm, I'm actually... I'm
really glad that you're here.

04:31.163 --> 04:33.826
- You are?
- Yeah.

04:34.339 --> 04:35.911
If this is where you wanna be,

04:35.936 --> 04:37.151
then I'm...

04:37.176 --> 04:39.110
It is, this is where I wanna be.

04:45.767 --> 04:47.934
I made a really big mistake.

04:49.399 --> 04:51.316
Breaking us up, I...

04:51.341 --> 04:53.651
I was going through a lot, and I...

04:53.676 --> 04:55.586
That'll happen when someone shoots you.

04:55.611 --> 04:56.864
Yeah.

04:58.697 --> 05:00.330
But I don't wanna be apart.

05:01.405 --> 05:03.164
We had a really great thing going.

05:04.481 --> 05:08.263
And I think we should have it again, now.

05:09.460 --> 05:10.958
- Yeah.
- If that's okay.

05:10.983 --> 05:12.193
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

05:12.218 --> 05:14.335
- I would really like that.
- (Nervous chuckle)

05:14.360 --> 05:16.835
I'd like that, too.

05:20.083 --> 05:23.341
(Elizabeth) That's it, that's everything.

05:23.366 --> 05:25.839
That's every little detail
of everything that I know.

05:26.475 --> 05:29.638
Now what I need to know is
why you ordered a mediblacko.

05:29.945 --> 05:31.651
My daughter's been missing for four hours.

05:31.676 --> 05:33.219
Unfortunately, I'm not in a position

05:33.244 --> 05:34.166
to share that information.

05:34.192 --> 05:35.358
I'm sorry, what?

05:35.463 --> 05:37.179
This is a federal case now, Miss Wilson.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.921
Detective Wilson.

05:41.333 --> 05:42.852
We appreciate all the information

05:42.877 --> 05:44.245
that you've given us.

05:44.643 --> 05:47.186
But the truth is, cop or no cop,

05:47.211 --> 05:49.432
you should've never had
the authority to oversee

05:49.457 --> 05:51.527
the abduction of your own daughter.

05:51.552 --> 05:54.032
Which is why you're no longer on the case.

05:55.254 --> 05:56.870
You don't have the authority to do that.

05:57.266 --> 05:58.816
Actually, I do.

05:59.729 --> 06:01.586
And you can bitch and moan
about it all your want.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.484
But it's not gonna do any good, so...

06:04.430 --> 06:06.943
What I would like you to do is go home.

06:06.968 --> 06:09.743
And let us know if Carter or Lori Stevens

06:09.768 --> 06:11.901
tries to contact you.

06:16.652 --> 06:18.421
- (Door opens closes)
- (Man) Excuse me, Sir?

06:19.025 --> 06:20.728
Mom?

06:21.330 --> 06:22.866
Oh, baby.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.567
Hey, you're awake.

06:25.592 --> 06:27.366
You feeling better, hon?

06:27.391 --> 06:29.057
Let me get you some water.

06:29.082 --> 06:32.166
Here. Here you go.

06:33.210 --> 06:36.211
Everything's gonna be okay, drink.

06:39.881 --> 06:41.166
You drugged me.

06:42.030 --> 06:44.767
I know, baby, I'm sorry, I had to.

06:45.470 --> 06:48.617
But... but it's not anything
that ever would've hurt you.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.116
You have to know that.

06:52.011 --> 06:53.677
It's just... I knew you
weren't in a position

06:53.702 --> 06:54.916
to hear what I had to say.

06:54.941 --> 06:56.774
What did you have to say?

06:59.213 --> 07:01.746
You'll know soon, I promise.

07:09.471 --> 07:12.310
Can I ask you something?

07:12.522 --> 07:14.133
Sure.

07:15.167 --> 07:17.434
You know Lori, or you did.

07:18.758 --> 07:20.176
Yeah.

07:20.784 --> 07:22.477
You don't think that...

07:23.195 --> 07:26.076
She would hurt Carter, do you?

07:26.595 --> 07:27.877
No.

07:28.491 --> 07:29.990
No, I don't think...

07:32.822 --> 07:34.867
- But I...
- What?

07:36.021 --> 07:38.271
I never thought that she would do this.

07:40.442 --> 07:42.409
So you think there's a chance that she...

07:42.444 --> 07:45.577
No-no, hey, I think that Carter...

07:45.602 --> 07:47.477
is not a little girl anymore.

07:49.370 --> 07:52.374
She's tough and smart.

07:54.516 --> 07:55.740
I think she's gonna be fine.

07:55.765 --> 07:57.431
You really think so?

07:58.593 --> 08:00.977
Yeah, I... I really think so.

08:02.140 --> 08:03.690
Okay.

08:12.440 --> 08:14.390
I'm off the case.

08:14.415 --> 08:15.666
They pulled me off the case.

08:15.691 --> 08:18.275
(David) What? Why?

08:18.300 --> 08:21.468
Because I'm her mother, I was too involved.

08:21.493 --> 08:23.020
I screwed everything up, okay?

08:23.045 --> 08:24.158
It's my fault that she's gone.

08:24.183 --> 08:25.846
That is not true. Did they say that?

08:25.871 --> 08:27.572
No, they didn't have to, David.

08:27.850 --> 08:29.683
I was there when she was taken.

08:29.708 --> 08:30.947
Right under my nose.

08:30.972 --> 08:33.270
Okay, okay, you... you were doing your job.

08:33.537 --> 08:36.037
If you wanna think about who
was where when things went down,

08:36.062 --> 08:37.977
David was inside the house when
Carter was taken from the front lawn!

08:38.003 --> 08:39.072
(Buddy) All right, that's enough, stop.

08:39.097 --> 08:40.063
Mom...

08:41.323 --> 08:44.324
For once, can we not make this about blame?

08:46.317 --> 08:48.765
Look, it's no one's fault.

08:50.238 --> 08:53.823
They are gonna find her, I know they are.

08:55.300 --> 08:58.968
Are they? Because I can't do this again.

08:58.993 --> 09:01.326
I can't lose our baby again.

09:01.351 --> 09:04.097
It's gonna be okay, I promise.

09:04.617 --> 09:06.400
How can you say that?!

09:07.642 --> 09:10.296
You don't know that, you
don't know that's gonna happen!

09:14.960 --> 09:16.460
I'll go.

09:23.826 --> 09:26.169
(Distant dog barking)

09:31.058 --> 09:32.308
Come on.

09:32.474 --> 09:34.190
Got a car over here.

09:36.172 --> 09:38.080
Hurry...

09:39.597 --> 09:41.430
Watch your step.

09:45.123 --> 09:46.762
Hold it.

09:59.547 --> 10:01.401
Where are we going?

10:04.572 --> 10:06.038
We're going to get Taylor.

10:09.468 --> 10:11.435
No! Carter!

10:15.690 --> 10:17.323
(Tires screeching)

10:17.358 --> 10:19.242
No!

10:19.267 --> 10:21.017
Aah!

10:32.340 --> 10:33.673
Carter, stop!

10:33.708 --> 10:35.174
Stop!

10:36.294 --> 10:38.588
- Just stop. Stop!
- Get... get off of me.

10:38.613 --> 10:40.619
Stop, please.

10:40.644 --> 10:43.944
I can't let you go until you
and Taylor know the truth.

10:45.332 --> 10:47.738
What does Taylor have to do with anything?

10:48.157 --> 10:50.065
You'll find out if you'll just calm down

10:50.090 --> 10:52.785
and let me handle this, okay?

10:52.810 --> 10:54.977
Here, here.

10:55.002 --> 10:56.500
Look at this, look, look.

10:56.887 --> 10:58.921
(Clicking) All right.

10:58.946 --> 11:00.903
I need you text that picture to Taylor

11:00.928 --> 11:02.378
so they know you're okay.

11:02.403 --> 11:05.270
Tell her to meet us at Clifton's Diner

11:05.295 --> 11:07.043
on route 50 in two hours.

11:07.353 --> 11:09.151
Okay?

11:09.285 --> 11:10.952
Why are you doing this?

11:12.103 --> 11:13.351
Oh, baby...

11:13.636 --> 11:15.224
(Sobbing) Oh, baby, I'm...

11:15.249 --> 11:16.643
I'm so sorry you're upset.

11:16.668 --> 11:19.765
- I know it's hard.
- Stop, just stop.

11:20.315 --> 11:21.698
(Sobbing)

11:21.738 --> 11:24.241
Look, look, look.

11:24.266 --> 11:27.941
I need you to think for a minute, okay?

11:27.966 --> 11:29.331
About us.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.689
Before all of this happened.

11:30.714 --> 11:33.531
Before you knew the Wilsons even existed.

11:34.441 --> 11:36.232
I love you, Carter.

11:36.574 --> 11:37.873
I always have,

11:37.898 --> 11:39.981
and you are everything to me.

11:40.347 --> 11:43.181
I need you to remember all that, okay?

11:43.206 --> 11:46.078
Remember, remember how it was.

11:46.114 --> 11:47.446
Remember us.

11:49.450 --> 11:51.946
Yeah, I remember.

11:52.227 --> 11:54.644
But you are not the person I knew.

11:54.669 --> 11:57.831
You're so different.

11:58.417 --> 12:00.653
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.628
No, baby.

12:02.653 --> 12:05.777
The only thing that's
different is the circumstances.

12:05.802 --> 12:08.661
And that is not our fault.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.577
And it's not fair.

12:11.305 --> 12:14.306
Just remember, please.

12:15.670 --> 12:17.870
Just give me one last chance,

12:17.895 --> 12:19.995
that's all I am asking.

12:20.398 --> 12:22.096
Please.

12:22.121 --> 12:25.396
Please, please, do it, please.

12:26.078 --> 12:28.396
(Sniffling)

12:30.295 --> 12:32.489
Please, baby.

12:33.327 --> 12:34.696
(Phone chimes)

12:38.114 --> 12:40.064
- Oh, my God.
- What?

12:40.089 --> 12:42.629
It's a photo of Lori and Carter.

12:43.026 --> 12:46.142
And it says to meet them in
two hours and to come alone.

12:50.932 --> 12:52.348
(David) Obviously, she's not going alone.

12:52.373 --> 12:53.873
(Elizabeth) She's not going at all.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.408
We have to decide before she gets home.

12:55.433 --> 12:57.626
Lori's gonna be at that diner with Carter.

12:57.651 --> 12:59.828
God knows what she'll do if no one's there.

12:59.853 --> 13:01.830
- Gotta call the FBI.
- No, and have a replay

13:01.855 --> 13:03.322
of what happened before? No way.

13:03.357 --> 13:04.863
She said no cops.

13:04.895 --> 13:06.574
What other option do we have?

13:06.599 --> 13:08.754
Dad, we're not involving the feds.

13:08.779 --> 13:10.946
Look, you're just upset because
they took you off the case.

13:10.971 --> 13:13.071
- Joan, please.
- Look, someone's gotta go!

13:13.096 --> 13:15.085
Joan, we will decide who's going.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.541
Could you give us a minute, please?

13:23.366 --> 13:25.498
Certainly.

13:30.700 --> 13:34.785
Liz, let's just slow down, we...

13:35.011 --> 13:36.857
We need to talk about some things.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.500
- What things?
- Things about Lori.

13:39.525 --> 13:42.576
What about her? Something
that will help us find Carter?

13:42.659 --> 13:43.525
No.

13:43.550 --> 13:45.633
Then, baby, whatever it is,

13:45.658 --> 13:46.907
it can wait.

13:46.932 --> 13:48.306
Because we have to decide

13:48.331 --> 13:50.606
what we're going to do right now.

13:54.608 --> 13:57.826
<i>♪♪</i>

13:57.912 --> 14:01.664
<i>♪ Do you hear the voices? ♪</i>

14:03.584 --> 14:06.618
<i>♪ Keep it quiet ♪</i>

14:12.259 --> 14:14.209
<i>♪ keep it quiet ♪</i>

14:14.234 --> 14:16.296
(Lori) Let's go for a ride.

14:44.004 --> 14:45.954
Mommy, where's Lyndon?

14:51.223 --> 14:53.473
(Elizabeth) It's just too dangerous, David.

14:55.813 --> 14:57.362
I'm going.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.562
No, no, absolutely not,

15:01.587 --> 15:03.003
you're not walking in that diner.

15:03.028 --> 15:04.227
It's not your choice.

15:04.252 --> 15:05.702
Taylor, the hell it isn't.

15:05.727 --> 15:07.516
- What's going on?
- Hang on, Joan.

15:09.860 --> 15:13.954
Ever since I stood in that doorway

15:13.979 --> 15:16.816
and watched Lori drive away with Carter,

15:16.841 --> 15:19.635
I have had to live every day

15:19.660 --> 15:23.715
knowing that I couldn't help anyone.

15:24.936 --> 15:26.416
Not Carter.

15:26.912 --> 15:29.178
Not you, no one.

15:29.203 --> 15:31.731
And I've dreamt a thousand times

15:31.756 --> 15:33.672
that I ran down that street

15:33.707 --> 15:34.984
and stopped them.

15:35.622 --> 15:38.883
And now I get to look
that woman in the eye...

15:39.765 --> 15:42.183
And I get to do something.

15:44.550 --> 15:46.049
I'm going.

15:53.770 --> 15:55.853
(Kyle) Almost finished, Taylor.

15:59.107 --> 16:00.640
There we go.

16:00.732 --> 16:02.873
- You okay?
- Yeah.

16:02.898 --> 16:04.431
I'll be able to hear everything.

16:04.456 --> 16:05.757
I'll be right outside.

16:05.782 --> 16:07.593
I don't understand why
she has to wear a wire.

16:07.618 --> 16:10.029
I mean, isn't it enough that
she's confronting this maniac?

16:10.054 --> 16:11.734
Mom, Lori might think that I'm wired,

16:11.786 --> 16:14.321
but she's never gonna check
Taylor, it's safer this way.

16:14.347 --> 16:15.896
What's going on?

16:17.742 --> 16:20.126
- Honey...
- Taylor's going?

16:20.151 --> 16:21.672
I'm going with her.

16:21.756 --> 16:24.054
But why does she have to go?
Why does anyone have to go?

16:24.079 --> 16:26.454
Why can't the police
just do their damn jobs?

16:26.479 --> 16:28.862
It's okay, everything's gonna be okay.

16:28.887 --> 16:31.429
I promise, I'm not gonna let
anything happen to anyone.

16:31.454 --> 16:33.066
Like you didn't let
anything happen to Carter?

16:33.091 --> 16:34.391
Like you didn't?

16:34.996 --> 16:37.690
Grant, wait, I wanna go.

16:38.489 --> 16:41.157
It's... it's gonna be fine.

16:41.342 --> 16:43.690
I promise.

16:44.982 --> 16:47.149
Can you do me a favor?

16:47.423 --> 16:49.249
Max texted me from the hospital,

16:49.274 --> 16:50.658
and his mom hasn't showed up.

16:50.683 --> 16:52.099
So could you and gammy go and get him

16:52.124 --> 16:53.623
and bring him back here?

16:53.648 --> 16:54.897
It would be really helpful.

16:54.922 --> 16:56.038
That's a great idea.

16:56.063 --> 16:57.730
And then we can all meet back here.

16:57.755 --> 16:59.541
Okay, we need to go.

16:59.701 --> 17:01.603
(Quietly) Thank you.

17:08.778 --> 17:11.328
Hey! Menus.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.781
Um, where would you like to sit?

17:13.806 --> 17:15.472
Uh, booth.

17:27.079 --> 17:30.140
Here, just act natural, look at your menu.

17:35.995 --> 17:37.528
This might come as a huge surprise,

17:37.553 --> 17:39.336
but I'm really not that hungry.

17:39.361 --> 17:41.464
Thanks.

17:53.042 --> 17:55.510
(Elizabeth) I'll give you the
signal when it's safe to move in.

17:55.728 --> 17:57.203
Don't do anything until then.

17:57.228 --> 17:59.851
(Kyle) Liz, be careful.

18:27.354 --> 18:28.936
(Elizabeth) Are you okay, Carter?

18:28.961 --> 18:30.627
Yeah.

18:32.133 --> 18:34.049
You were supposed to come alone.

18:34.074 --> 18:36.466
There was no way that was ever happening.

18:36.491 --> 18:38.885
Yeah, just as well.

18:38.910 --> 18:39.983
You'll wanna hear the truth.

18:40.008 --> 18:42.083
<i>Slide in next to your sister.</i>

18:46.328 --> 18:48.545
Better not be any other cops around.

18:50.721 --> 18:53.080
Get in.

18:58.066 --> 19:00.567
Get in.

19:11.402 --> 19:14.152
Well, we're all here.

19:14.200 --> 19:15.733
Why don't you go ahead and tell us what was

19:15.758 --> 19:17.603
so important that you had to kidnap me?

19:17.628 --> 19:20.747
- Again.
- Again.

19:21.328 --> 19:24.413
I need you to know I
am not the bad guy here.

19:26.524 --> 19:28.221
You're not the bad guy?

19:31.117 --> 19:33.259
Then what are you, exactly?

19:33.474 --> 19:35.478
I am your real mother.

19:39.962 --> 19:42.046
And I'm Taylor's mother, too.

19:51.617 --> 19:53.117
What is she talking about?

19:54.383 --> 19:56.430
Female, age 23.

19:56.804 --> 19:58.586
5'8" tall,

19:58.617 --> 20:00.140
brown hair, brown eyes.

20:00.763 --> 20:03.209
Graduate of Jacobsen Nursing College,

20:03.234 --> 20:04.726
June, 1996.

20:05.070 --> 20:06.583
Health: excellent.

20:07.280 --> 20:09.343
Marital status: single.

20:09.670 --> 20:11.045
Siblings: none.

20:13.123 --> 20:16.416
Donor number 3-5-2-6.

20:18.579 --> 20:20.488
What is she talking about?

20:22.477 --> 20:24.977
Mom? Tell us.

20:35.681 --> 20:38.148
I couldn't get pregnant.

20:39.791 --> 20:43.176
<i>Your dad and I tried
for three years.</i>

20:45.141 --> 20:47.642
Went to a clinic, and
they said they could help.

20:51.126 --> 20:54.438
That's when we decided
to look for an egg donor.

20:55.578 --> 20:57.137
They chose me.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.724
I was donor number 3-5-2-6.

21:06.941 --> 21:09.275
My mom got her wires crossed.

21:09.407 --> 21:11.574
Thought I was being discharged tomorrow.

21:11.713 --> 21:13.180
These things happen.

21:13.832 --> 21:15.248
Have you heard anything?

21:15.273 --> 21:18.108
My mom went with, uh, Taylor
to meet Carter and Lori.

21:18.133 --> 21:21.069
- Yeah, I know.
- How do you know?

21:21.094 --> 21:23.358
Taylor texted me before they left.

21:23.383 --> 21:24.749
Why didn't you stop her?

21:24.774 --> 21:27.155
Because you realize, right,
that everyone in my family

21:27.180 --> 21:28.818
is now in the presence of a crazy person.

21:28.843 --> 21:31.399
And everybody's just acting like this is

21:31.424 --> 21:33.591
stuff that happens every
day, like it's normal.

21:33.616 --> 21:35.312
Darling, no one thinks that anything that

21:35.337 --> 21:36.920
goes on in this family is remotely normal.

21:36.945 --> 21:38.694
This isn't funny, she could kill them all.

21:38.719 --> 21:40.635
Hey, buddy, calm down.

21:40.922 --> 21:43.890
All right, your mom and
dad are both there with her.

21:43.968 --> 21:45.601
Gabe's dad's there too.

21:45.626 --> 21:47.241
They're not gonna let
anything happen to anybody.

21:47.266 --> 21:48.937
But they let her get kidnapped again.

21:48.962 --> 21:50.738
They knew where she is.

21:50.763 --> 21:52.296
They're with her.

21:52.597 --> 21:54.637
And you know something else?

21:55.055 --> 21:57.937
Carter is much smarter than Lori.

21:58.239 --> 22:01.238
Okay, she's way ahead of her,
I guarantee Carter has a plan.

22:02.351 --> 22:03.517
Okay?

22:03.740 --> 22:06.691
All right? All right?

22:07.400 --> 22:09.734
- Good, better?
- Yes.

22:09.759 --> 22:11.342
Hey, why don't you go and get the nurse?

22:11.367 --> 22:13.033
Tell 'em we're ready to leave.

22:13.058 --> 22:15.609
Sooner we get home, the
sooner we see 'em, okay?

22:18.917 --> 22:20.858
You're very good with him, you know?

22:20.883 --> 22:23.767
Thank you. He's a good kid.

22:24.990 --> 22:27.874
I can see why you and
Taylor would be an item.

22:27.899 --> 22:29.472
I should warn you, though.

22:29.497 --> 22:31.272
All the Wilson women are bonkers.

22:31.297 --> 22:33.096
It's... it's genetic.

22:34.164 --> 22:36.073
Ah, your chariot awaits.

22:36.098 --> 22:37.873
There we go.

22:42.297 --> 22:44.464
Mom.

22:45.034 --> 22:47.084
Why didn't you tell us?

22:47.109 --> 22:49.014
Your father and I, we wanted to tell you

22:49.039 --> 22:52.014
<i>when you were older, but then... </i>

22:52.624 --> 22:54.707
We never got a chance.

22:55.683 --> 22:57.967
What about me?

22:58.247 --> 23:00.714
I mean, you had a chance to tell me.

23:01.028 --> 23:02.593
I know, sweetie,

23:02.618 --> 23:04.318
but the idea of telling you alone

23:04.343 --> 23:06.977
without Carter, it was
just another reminder...

23:09.791 --> 23:10.756
(Banging table)

23:11.351 --> 23:14.355
What is it that you want from us?

23:14.498 --> 23:18.870
I only want is family. I am
their mother and I have rights.

23:19.147 --> 23:20.887
You don't have any rights.

23:20.913 --> 23:23.140
You never did, and you never will.

23:23.165 --> 23:24.698
Where is it you think that kind of attitude

23:24.723 --> 23:25.691
is gonna get us?

23:28.334 --> 23:31.623
Maybe in the eyes of the
law I have no rights.,

23:31.723 --> 23:33.882
but in the eyes of human beings

23:33.907 --> 23:35.218
and the eyes of God, I do.

23:35.243 --> 23:37.343
- Meaning what?
- Meaning...

23:37.368 --> 23:39.235
All I have ever wanted

23:39.260 --> 23:41.350
is to come to some kind of arrangement

23:41.375 --> 23:43.113
without the involvement of the police

23:43.138 --> 23:44.912
where I can be a part
of my daughters' lives.

23:44.937 --> 23:46.687
(Whispering) Let me make this

23:46.712 --> 23:49.113
perfectly clear to you.

23:49.627 --> 23:51.813
That is never going to happen.

23:53.146 --> 23:55.113
Then guess what?

23:58.315 --> 24:00.448
None of us are leaving here.

24:09.858 --> 24:12.232
(Carter) <i>What did you think</i>
<i>was going to happen?</i>

24:12.922 --> 24:15.614
That we just walk away with
you and live happily ever after?

24:15.639 --> 24:17.876
I thought you'd start
to see things differently

24:18.131 --> 24:19.739
when you knew the truth.

24:19.764 --> 24:21.701
Carter, you know me.

24:22.203 --> 24:25.300
You know I would never
intentionally hurt you.

24:25.670 --> 24:27.513
And you and I, we both know

24:27.538 --> 24:30.074
what it's like to lose a child.

24:30.161 --> 24:32.558
I honestly thought as... as a mother,

24:32.583 --> 24:34.864
you would understand what I'm
going through and want to help.

24:34.889 --> 24:36.187
Help?

24:36.212 --> 24:38.137
You kidnapped my daughter,

24:38.162 --> 24:40.936
and now you're holding
her against her will.

24:40.961 --> 24:42.511
I should've known better than to expect

24:42.536 --> 24:44.236
any understanding from you.

24:45.281 --> 24:47.614
You don't seem to know what
it means to be a mother.

24:47.639 --> 24:49.458
That you would do anything
to be with your kids.

24:49.483 --> 24:51.619
She looked for me for 13 years.

24:51.644 --> 24:53.719
You ruined her life.

24:53.744 --> 24:55.677
You ruined all of our lives.

24:55.702 --> 24:57.039
No, I didn't.

25:00.424 --> 25:02.139
They did.

25:02.164 --> 25:03.696
When you two were babies,

25:03.721 --> 25:07.294
I tried to contact them anonymously

25:07.319 --> 25:09.102
to let them know that I was the donor.

25:09.127 --> 25:10.536
They wouldn't even meet me.

25:10.561 --> 25:11.874
We didn't have to meet you.

25:11.899 --> 25:13.874
That's the deal that you
made when you donated.

25:13.899 --> 25:15.636
We're not talking about deals.

25:15.660 --> 25:18.272
We are talking about human beings,

25:18.297 --> 25:20.234
babies and mothers.

25:21.064 --> 25:23.038
This is why I knew I had to tell

25:23.063 --> 25:25.699
the two of you in person so
that you would understand.

25:25.724 --> 25:28.398
Things are not as simple as they sound.

25:29.086 --> 25:31.503
You are my blood.

25:32.002 --> 25:34.699
You are a part of me.

25:34.878 --> 25:36.553
I am your mother.

25:36.578 --> 25:38.163
You are not my mother.

25:38.188 --> 25:40.309
You have... you have to stop staying that.

25:40.587 --> 25:42.370
Honey...

25:43.869 --> 25:45.646
The only reason you feel that way

25:45.671 --> 25:47.170
is because I had the decency

25:47.195 --> 25:48.538
to leave you there with her.

25:48.563 --> 25:50.799
Oh, my God.

25:51.630 --> 25:53.799
What is that supposed to mean?

25:53.824 --> 25:55.898
I could've taken you.

25:56.408 --> 25:58.599
I had absolutely every right to.

25:58.954 --> 26:02.362
But I know what it feels
like to lose a child,

26:02.387 --> 26:04.437
and I didn't want her to lose you both.

26:05.672 --> 26:07.005
And this is how I'm repaid.

26:07.030 --> 26:08.499
You...

26:09.141 --> 26:11.799
Are gonna get exactly what you deserve.

26:12.455 --> 26:14.499
- Prison.
- Really?

26:14.524 --> 26:16.357
That's what I deserve?

26:17.601 --> 26:19.317
What is it you think you deserve?

26:19.342 --> 26:22.349
Because whatever happens next,
you brought it on yourself.

26:22.374 --> 26:25.548
Stop, please, just stop!

26:25.573 --> 26:28.240
Shh. Quiet, you'll attract attention.

26:31.546 --> 26:34.213
Taylor, come here, it's okay.

26:43.242 --> 26:44.959
<i>(Static crackles)</i> What happened?

26:44.992 --> 26:46.505
Someone pulled the wire.

26:46.530 --> 26:48.070
- Who?
- I don't know.

26:48.095 --> 26:49.553
Wait, what... Elizabeth said

26:49.578 --> 26:50.877
not to go in until she gave a signal.

26:50.902 --> 26:52.663
For all I know, that was the signal, okay?

26:52.688 --> 26:54.430
I can't leave them in
there without communication.

26:54.455 --> 26:55.758
- I'm coming with you.
- No!

26:55.783 --> 26:57.766
We don't know what's
going on in there, okay?

26:57.791 --> 26:59.419
I need you to stay here.

26:59.444 --> 27:01.661
Don't move until I tell you.

27:04.159 --> 27:05.709
(Car door closes)

27:08.647 --> 27:11.829
(Lori) This woman has no concept
of what it means to be a mother.

27:12.164 --> 27:13.330
From the very beginning,

27:13.355 --> 27:15.228
she tried to keep me away from you.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.888
That's a cop, go! Let's go.

27:23.913 --> 27:25.438
No. Not you, don't you move a muscle,

27:25.463 --> 27:26.495
or you will be very sorry.

27:26.520 --> 27:27.735
Come on, let's go, now.

27:27.760 --> 27:29.728
No, leave Taylor, I'll go with you.

27:29.753 --> 27:31.094
- Go.
- Stop it.

27:31.120 --> 27:32.892
- Walk in front of me.
- Leave her, I'll go!

27:33.666 --> 27:35.666
Oh!

27:35.691 --> 27:37.657
Call 9-1-1 now!

27:37.682 --> 27:39.515
Go!

27:39.619 --> 27:40.932
- Go, get in.
- No.

27:40.957 --> 27:42.379
Now. No, you can't take Taylor.

27:42.404 --> 27:43.581
I'm not gonna say this again.

27:43.606 --> 27:44.605
Get in the car.

27:46.808 --> 27:49.034
Run! Go!

27:49.059 --> 27:50.225
Aah!

28:01.768 --> 28:03.234
Mom!

28:27.501 --> 28:29.584
Mom, are you okay?

28:44.733 --> 28:48.902
(Wailing siren approaching)

28:53.276 --> 28:55.210
(Elizabeth) And I thought I
was the tough one in the family.

28:57.268 --> 28:58.684
You okay?

28:59.005 --> 29:02.557
Yeah, it's just a minor abrasion.

29:04.064 --> 29:05.689
Hey.

29:06.898 --> 29:08.389
It's okay.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.297
It's all over.

29:14.105 --> 29:15.889
Um...

29:16.144 --> 29:17.843
So, uh...

29:18.311 --> 29:19.575
What happens now?

29:19.600 --> 29:22.774
Well, now I get to take you home.

29:24.995 --> 29:27.573
I, um, I meant to Lori?

29:33.220 --> 29:35.582
Well, she'll spend the night in jail.

29:35.607 --> 29:39.181
And then she'll see her lawyer
and the judge in the morning.

29:40.681 --> 29:42.231
Hey. Hey.

29:42.256 --> 29:43.505
How you doing?

29:43.530 --> 29:46.186
Oh, I'm... I'm fine.

29:46.211 --> 29:47.928
I just gave my statement.

29:47.953 --> 29:49.985
Your FBI friend wants to see you.

29:51.043 --> 29:52.710
(Sighing) Oh, great.

29:52.735 --> 29:56.153
Okay, I will be right back, and then...

29:56.178 --> 29:57.927
I'm taking us home.

30:02.104 --> 30:03.742
All right, sue me.

30:03.767 --> 30:05.882
Waterboard me, do whatever
you guys do over there.

30:05.907 --> 30:08.682
I got my daughter back.
That's all I care about.

30:10.536 --> 30:13.241
We'll need you to give
a statement... obviously.

30:13.266 --> 30:14.741
And to testify.

30:15.872 --> 30:17.155
Of course.

30:17.694 --> 30:20.779
I'd like to watch your follow-up
if that's okay with you.

30:21.012 --> 30:22.345
It's not standard procedure.

30:22.515 --> 30:25.350
I think we both established
that's not my priority.

30:26.994 --> 30:29.711
Well, since you did help us nab her,

30:29.852 --> 30:31.241
I'm willing to let you observe.

30:32.474 --> 30:34.391
She'll be lawyering up soon.

30:34.662 --> 30:36.779
Should have her back here in a day or two.

30:37.932 --> 30:39.642
Thank you.

30:40.355 --> 30:42.042
I been thinking...

30:43.815 --> 30:47.142
Maybe the FBI should start
recruiting a few more mothers.

30:48.344 --> 30:50.142
Maybe they should.

31:04.108 --> 31:05.851
How does it feel?

31:06.245 --> 31:07.912
How does what feel?

31:08.617 --> 31:10.651
Living in denial.

31:10.718 --> 31:14.220
Uh-huh, I'm living in denial because...

31:14.344 --> 31:16.651
You're the one getting fingerprinted.

31:18.668 --> 31:20.998
You think what I told you
about being your egg donor

31:21.023 --> 31:23.659
is the whole story? It's not.

31:23.684 --> 31:26.155
Why would I believe one word that you say?

31:26.180 --> 31:27.559
You're about to go to prison.

31:28.609 --> 31:30.659
Because I know things.

31:31.159 --> 31:32.869
I knew the truth about
the egg donation, didn't I?

31:32.894 --> 31:34.978
(Scoffing)

31:35.003 --> 31:36.920
Don't believe me, ask David.

31:38.525 --> 31:39.975
What are you saying, that David knew

31:40.000 --> 31:41.166
that you were the egg donor?

31:41.191 --> 31:43.159
No, I'm not saying that.

31:43.475 --> 31:44.974
But he knows other things.

31:47.273 --> 31:49.458
Important things you would want to know.

31:50.105 --> 31:51.859
You are a sick...

31:52.286 --> 31:54.859
Delusional felon.

31:55.383 --> 31:56.958
That's all I need to know.

31:58.063 --> 31:59.359
Is it?

32:00.625 --> 32:03.559
Because I am not the
only one to blame here.

32:04.322 --> 32:07.458
David did a number on both of us.

32:07.581 --> 32:09.281
Yeah.

32:09.920 --> 32:12.258
Go ahead, ask him.

32:12.514 --> 32:14.659
I dare you.

32:22.570 --> 32:24.397
- (Elizabeth) Hey!
- They're here!

32:24.422 --> 32:26.371
(Buddy) Oh, thank God.

32:27.506 --> 32:28.889
Hi, mom.

32:28.914 --> 32:30.330
Hey, Max. Oh, sweetheart.

32:30.355 --> 32:32.555
It's nothing, mom, it's
just a little scuffle.

32:32.580 --> 32:33.996
A little scuffle?

32:34.021 --> 32:35.855
Yeah, a major scuffle, mom.

32:35.917 --> 32:38.194
Lori tried to take us both with her.

32:38.219 --> 32:39.846
What is wrong with that woman?

32:39.871 --> 32:41.337
(Grant) Well, I think it's called insanity.

32:41.372 --> 32:42.849
Dad tackled her.

32:42.874 --> 32:44.373
(Carter) Yeah, it was very Vin Diesel.

32:44.425 --> 32:45.841
Good move.

32:45.877 --> 32:47.710
Oh, I'm... I'm impressed.

32:47.735 --> 32:49.196
Thank you, Joan.

32:49.221 --> 32:51.180
I... I didn't know you had it in you.

32:51.205 --> 32:53.014
Okay, okay, thank you, mom, thank you.

32:53.039 --> 32:54.621
Why don't we go and get something to eat?

32:54.646 --> 32:56.422
Everyone's so sensitive.

32:57.248 --> 32:59.298
So, is this like a hugging moment?

32:59.323 --> 33:02.222
Yeah, this is definitely a hugging moment.

33:04.332 --> 33:06.132
You know, I can tell that
you cheated right there.

33:06.157 --> 33:08.822
- You ordered that in.
- How are you doing?

33:09.328 --> 33:10.444
I'm okay.

33:10.469 --> 33:11.551
- Mm-hmm?
- Yeah.

33:11.576 --> 33:12.945
I feel like I'm caught in the middle

33:12.970 --> 33:14.814
of a really great family vibe here.

33:14.943 --> 33:16.609
I'm glad you're here.

33:16.634 --> 33:17.917
We're all glad you're here.

33:17.942 --> 33:19.158
I'll call my mom in the morning,

33:19.183 --> 33:20.373
- she'll come pick me...
- What?

33:20.689 --> 33:23.103
Call your mom, no, Max,
you're staying here.

33:23.135 --> 33:24.217
Yeah, Max.

33:24.342 --> 33:25.708
I, I just don't wanna be in the way.

33:25.733 --> 33:28.165
- Not at all.
- (Overlapping chatter)

33:28.462 --> 33:29.628
I mean, if you're sure.

33:29.653 --> 33:31.697
Of course we're sure.
Listen, Taylor told me

33:31.722 --> 33:33.632
you had to do physical therapy every day.

33:33.657 --> 33:36.041
- That's too far to drive.
- Yeah... you're pushy, honey.

33:36.066 --> 33:37.806
- I'm pushy?
- Yeah, he said he'd stay.

33:37.831 --> 33:40.139
Okay, you're staying, it's settled.

33:40.164 --> 33:41.330
Good choice.

33:41.355 --> 33:43.054
It never pays to argue with

33:43.079 --> 33:45.079
the Wilson women. It never ends.

33:45.104 --> 33:46.441
I'll second that emotion.

33:46.466 --> 33:48.941
Grant, honey, set the table, would you?

33:55.522 --> 33:56.688
- Hey.
- Hi.

33:56.713 --> 33:58.824
Your mom and I wanted to talk to you guys

33:58.849 --> 34:01.356
about this egg donor business.

34:02.272 --> 34:03.772
Okay.

34:04.419 --> 34:07.220
Well, I guess what I wanted to say was,

34:07.245 --> 34:11.757
no matter what we found
out about our biology,

34:11.782 --> 34:13.672
that the time

34:13.697 --> 34:17.157
that I had you, um...

34:18.541 --> 34:19.873
When you were babies...

34:19.899 --> 34:21.956
It doesn't change anything.

34:22.214 --> 34:24.683
What she said, if that's
what you're worried about.

34:24.708 --> 34:26.579
Well, we thought we should talk about it.

34:26.603 --> 34:30.606
You mean the fact that you never told us?

34:30.630 --> 34:33.047
Or me even though I was
with you the whole time?

34:33.072 --> 34:34.121
Honey, I explained to you...

34:34.147 --> 34:37.232
yeah. Yeah, yeah, you did.

34:37.467 --> 34:39.632
But it doesn't matter.

34:40.149 --> 34:42.364
We don't have to talk about it anymore.

34:42.458 --> 34:44.132
Ever.

34:44.237 --> 34:46.232
I'm gonna go help Max.

34:47.192 --> 34:48.931
Tay...

34:48.956 --> 34:51.632
She just needs time to process.

34:56.558 --> 34:58.913
We just wanted to apologize.

35:02.081 --> 35:04.081
I should've told you before.

35:07.300 --> 35:08.849
Thanks.

35:10.377 --> 35:11.926
But...

35:12.365 --> 35:14.622
Just to be clear.

35:14.698 --> 35:17.950
We are done with all the lies, right?

35:18.191 --> 35:19.774
Please?

35:21.205 --> 35:24.521
Yes, no more lies.

35:26.710 --> 35:28.383
Okay.

35:30.714 --> 35:32.915
(Sniffles)

35:38.896 --> 35:41.396
(Knocking on door)

35:43.162 --> 35:45.218
- Hey.
- Hi.

35:45.446 --> 35:46.945
What are you doing?

35:47.207 --> 35:48.873
I don't know, just...

35:48.898 --> 35:51.015
Thought I'd sleep down here tonight.

35:51.040 --> 35:54.708
You know, the stairs, kind
of difficult to navigate.

35:54.804 --> 35:57.946
Yeah, yeah, of course.

36:02.734 --> 36:05.769
Do you want me to sleep down here tonight?

36:05.794 --> 36:07.677
No, that's okay.

36:08.172 --> 36:09.705
It's been a pretty big day.

36:09.730 --> 36:11.279
We could probably both use some rest.

36:11.315 --> 36:13.031
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right?

36:13.056 --> 36:14.890
- Definitely.
- Yeah.

36:14.915 --> 36:16.592
Okay, well,

36:16.617 --> 36:17.783
I'll see you in the morning.

36:17.816 --> 36:20.320
Okay, okay.

36:23.548 --> 36:25.431
- Night.
- Night.

36:39.516 --> 36:41.932
(David) What is it?

36:43.322 --> 36:45.115
What's wrong?

36:46.542 --> 36:48.416
I'm scared.

36:50.271 --> 36:52.316
It's over.

36:52.679 --> 36:54.716
They're home.

36:55.017 --> 36:57.669
She can't hurt us anymore.

36:57.694 --> 37:00.017
She already has.

37:00.506 --> 37:04.117
Did you see how angry
Taylor is, how distant?

37:04.142 --> 37:05.514
Well, you heard what she said.

37:05.564 --> 37:06.980
She wants to move past this.

37:07.005 --> 37:08.621
She just needs time.

37:09.735 --> 37:11.869
I never wanted them to know.

37:15.542 --> 37:18.944
I was gonna take the secret to my grave.

37:20.535 --> 37:23.249
Now they'll never feel
like I'm their mother.

37:23.598 --> 37:25.616
Oh...

37:27.049 --> 37:28.215
You're wrong.

37:28.240 --> 37:29.406
Am I?

37:31.084 --> 37:32.500
You're the only mother

37:32.525 --> 37:34.058
Taylor's ever had.

37:34.083 --> 37:37.015
You're the only mother Carter wants.

37:37.362 --> 37:39.195
There's nothing that woman can say

37:39.220 --> 37:41.216
that will change any of that.

37:41.871 --> 37:45.089
<i>♪ I'm movin' on ♪</i>

37:45.296 --> 37:48.881
<i>♪ 'cause I'm not the one ♪</i>

37:48.906 --> 37:51.406
<i>♪ who made you ♪</i>

37:57.414 --> 38:00.784
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:01.472 --> 38:05.282
- Are you okay?
- You look funny.

38:05.999 --> 38:09.000
This is my post-abduction look.

38:16.068 --> 38:18.602
Hey, can I ask you something?

38:18.627 --> 38:19.960
Yeah.

38:21.119 --> 38:23.903
Would you stay with me tonight?

38:23.928 --> 38:26.371
I don't feel like being alone.

38:28.032 --> 38:30.469
Yeah, definitely.

38:31.567 --> 38:33.067
Thanks.

38:34.421 --> 38:38.340
<i>♪ Okay... ♪</i>

38:38.497 --> 38:41.081
<i>♪ I'm movin' on... ♪</i>

38:41.106 --> 38:43.470
You sure you're okay?

38:43.955 --> 38:46.770
Nothing is what I thought it was.

38:46.816 --> 38:50.071
I just can't wrap my mind around that.

38:50.862 --> 38:53.071
Yeah, I know what you mean.

38:53.599 --> 38:57.270
Like, how could mom not be my mom?

38:59.068 --> 39:01.263
I don't even know what
the word means anymore.

39:06.308 --> 39:08.975
But you know what, though?

39:09.224 --> 39:11.591
One thing we do know.

39:11.646 --> 39:13.279
We're sisters.

39:13.304 --> 39:15.504
Nothing's gonna change that.

39:16.537 --> 39:18.003
Ever.

39:18.028 --> 39:21.663
<i>♪ I'm not gonna
make you shine ♪</i>

39:36.145 --> 39:38.145
I saw her again.

39:39.794 --> 39:41.712
Before I left the station.

39:44.596 --> 39:46.825
She said something strange.

39:47.564 --> 39:49.447
What do you mean?

39:50.194 --> 39:52.060
Well, she's obviously delusional,

39:52.085 --> 39:54.739
but the donor thing was real.

39:54.764 --> 39:56.726
What did she say?

39:58.066 --> 40:00.691
She said that she wasn't
the only one to blame,

40:00.716 --> 40:02.861
that...

40:02.990 --> 40:06.358
You did a number on both of us.

40:14.962 --> 40:17.101
What did she mean by that?
