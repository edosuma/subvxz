00:31.448 --> 00:33.366
They couldn't hear me.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.662
They couldn't see me.

00:39.289 --> 00:42.208
But I could hear them and see them.

00:44.627 --> 00:50.258
It's been a secret all these years.
It's been a secret for 47 years.

00:52.093 --> 00:54.137
Nobody ever will be able to do what I did.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.264
Yeah.

00:57.223 --> 00:59.642
A lot of people
are gonna call me a pervert...

01:00.602 --> 01:02.020
Peeping Tom.

01:03.855 --> 01:05.397
I'm prepared for that.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.526
But I have to tell somebody,

01:08.610 --> 01:12.864
because I just didn't wanna die
and it be lost forever.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.169
The beginning...

01:27.378 --> 01:30.256
has to get the attention of the reader.

01:30.340 --> 01:33.218
Page one, paragraph one, sentence one.

01:34.636 --> 01:35.929
How do you begin?

01:39.057 --> 01:42.310
I'd been a reporter
from the time I was 15.

01:42.977 --> 01:44.979
I'm 80 now.

01:47.649 --> 01:52.112
My life has pretty much been living
through other people's experiences,

01:52.195 --> 01:54.405
and to be a very accurate chronicler.

01:55.615 --> 01:56.783
An observer.

01:58.159 --> 02:01.037
Watching other people. Listening.

02:02.455 --> 02:03.832
I take my time,

02:03.915 --> 02:06.918
and I am genuinely interested
in the people I'm writing about,

02:07.001 --> 02:10.630
because there's something about them
that I feel I can identify with.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.426
I live in a brownstone.

02:15.510 --> 02:19.180
A small dot in a crowded block
on the east side of Manhattan.

02:20.306 --> 02:24.936
I always dress very nicely.
Clothes make a difference.

02:26.729 --> 02:30.358
My father was a tailor,
always beautifully dressed.

02:30.942 --> 02:35.363
As a boy in my father's tailor shop,
I had clothes made for me.

02:36.739 --> 02:40.827
My father was a prideful tailor.
I became a prideful journalist.

02:45.456 --> 02:47.750
I have this converted wine cellar.

02:49.085 --> 02:50.587
I call it a bunker.

02:53.381 --> 02:58.219
The volume of material here represents
probably 50 years of research

02:58.803 --> 03:01.723
propelled by endless curiosity.

03:01.806 --> 03:04.017
With the flip of a page,
I can tell you who I was with,

03:04.100 --> 03:06.227
who I had dinner with, where I was.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.270
It's all there.

03:07.353 --> 03:08.980
Look at this small type.

03:09.063 --> 03:12.984
I have in my files, collected papers,
chronological through the year.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.570
"Gay Talese, '53,
copy boy, New York Times."

03:15.653 --> 03:17.363
Now we're into the '60s, '66.

03:17.447 --> 03:20.366
This is where the Sinatra thing,
and Joe DiMaggio...

03:20.450 --> 03:23.202
I have every article I ever wrote
and also the notes.

03:23.286 --> 03:24.579
All this crap I keep.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.376
Some of these boxes will testify

03:30.460 --> 03:35.215
to the collecting of material
that later became a book, a magazine.

03:35.798 --> 03:36.883
Everything is valuable.

03:36.966 --> 03:39.552
Even when you don't write,
you've learned something.

03:40.803 --> 03:43.431
Okay, well, I'm ready for a gin martini.

03:45.016 --> 03:48.102
The story never ends.
The stories never die.

03:51.314 --> 03:55.860
A lot of reporters think, you know,
when they leave the story, it's all over.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.613
Sometimes it's just beginning.

04:02.617 --> 04:07.038
I'm pursuing a story
about a man named Gerald Foos

04:07.121 --> 04:11.125
who decided he wanted to buy a motel...

04:12.710 --> 04:14.504
for the express purpose

04:14.587 --> 04:19.007
of using it to watch everything
that was being done in private.

04:19.841 --> 04:23.638
He could see what people were doing
in the privacy of their motel room,

04:23.721 --> 04:28.977
looking down through this vent system that
gave him full access as he peers through,

04:29.060 --> 04:31.271
watching in a crouched position.

04:34.774 --> 04:37.986
Can't believe this story.
You can't make this up.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.321
You can't make it up.

04:43.032 --> 04:45.827
- Okay, do we start?
- We're rolling.

04:47.578 --> 04:52.959
Hey, Gerald, when do you think
you actually became a voyeur?

04:54.210 --> 04:59.924
I was brought up
in a very secluded sexual environment...

05:00.008 --> 05:00.842
Yeah.

05:00.925 --> 05:04.804
where my mom and dad
never told me anything about sex.

05:04.887 --> 05:06.848
And I had to learn it on my own.

05:06.931 --> 05:09.309
And I knew there was more to life...

05:10.226 --> 05:12.061
and more to sex.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.689
I just knew that it had to be more.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.525
I had told Donna that I was a voyeur.

05:17.608 --> 05:21.321
She says,
"Isn't that what they call a Peeping Tom?"

05:21.404 --> 05:22.405
I says, "Yeah."

05:23.948 --> 05:25.950
"But I call it voyeurism."

05:28.703 --> 05:33.666
I says, "I wanna get a laboratory."
And she said, "What?"

05:33.750 --> 05:36.127
And I said, "I wanna buy a laboratory."

05:37.420 --> 05:43.051
I think I know how I'm gonna do it,
but it has to be absolutely foolproof

05:43.134 --> 05:45.386
"insofar as anyone ever discovering it."

05:47.430 --> 05:50.600
The street was basically built
for tourist travel.

05:50.683 --> 05:54.145
That's the kind of people
that occupied the rooms.

05:54.228 --> 05:55.063
Yeah.

05:55.146 --> 05:57.023
I couldn't really find
what I was looking for,

05:57.106 --> 06:00.068
and all of a sudden,
I came by the Manor House.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.903
The Manor House Motel.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.698
After I looked in that motel,

06:05.782 --> 06:10.912
I fell in love with it
because it was exactly what I wanted.

06:10.995 --> 06:13.664
Describe for us what the motel
looked like.

06:13.748 --> 06:17.919
It had a high-pitched roof,
where I could walk down the middle.

06:18.002 --> 06:22.006
And I figured that's where
I would build my observation platform.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.841
- Right.
- Took about a year.

06:23.925 --> 06:27.303
- Yeah.
- Because I didn't wanna make any mistakes.

06:28.596 --> 06:31.516
I said, "I'll have to do
most of the construction",

06:31.599 --> 06:33.810
because I don't want anybody to find out
what I'm doing."

06:34.393 --> 06:37.355
When I'm thinking about this, I'm saying,
"Maybe a louver."

06:37.438 --> 06:39.690
- Yeah.
- It's kind of a heating vent.

06:40.775 --> 06:46.114
But my whole emphasis
was on absolutely private situation,

06:46.197 --> 06:48.116
that they couldn't hear me,

06:49.033 --> 06:53.871
they couldn't see me,
but I could hear them and see them.

06:56.124 --> 06:59.127
You and Donna had been co-owners
until her death.

06:59.210 --> 07:03.297
And the second marriage,
that woman, Anita Clark,

07:03.381 --> 07:06.801
she filled in as adequately
as did your first wife.

07:07.426 --> 07:11.597
What's amazing is you found two women
who were cooperative.

07:11.681 --> 07:14.851
Maybe somebody might say
that was an act of God.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.485
You see, I associate most things with God.

07:26.112 --> 07:29.574
How powerful do you have to be
to create a universe?

07:31.200 --> 07:34.287
I like to think of a supreme being.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.290
He can do this...

07:39.167 --> 07:40.877
and it vanishes.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.712
It's gone.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.179
I'm a natural person
to write about a voyeur,

07:51.262 --> 07:53.181
because I'm a voyeur myself.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.642
As a writer, I wanna be
inside their private lives.

07:58.978 --> 08:01.522
I'm choosing
how we're gonna tell the story,

08:01.606 --> 08:04.942
how we're gonna shade it,
color it, choreograph it.

08:06.777 --> 08:09.447
And here is this weirdo,
taking it upon himself

08:09.530 --> 08:14.452
to build this cathedral of sorts,
this little motel, a make-believe.

08:15.411 --> 08:18.414
He thinks he's gonna see great things...

08:19.373 --> 08:22.376
great sexual circus
every night of the week.

08:28.674 --> 08:31.844
This relationship I had with him
starts with a letter.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.639
I received this letter
on January 7th, 1980.

08:34.722 --> 08:37.558
"Dear Mr. Talese,
since learning of your long-awaited study"

08:37.642 --> 08:39.644
of coast-to-coast sex in America,

08:39.727 --> 08:42.563
which will be included
in Thy Neighbor's Wife,

08:42.647 --> 08:46.025
I feel I have information
that I could contribute to its contents,

08:46.108 --> 08:48.361
"or to contents of future books."

08:48.945 --> 08:50.279
This letter goes on.

08:50.363 --> 08:54.408
Finally said, "If you're interested,
here's my address."

08:54.492 --> 08:58.287
Surely, this was a kind of guy
I wanted to know more about.

09:03.167 --> 09:05.336
I have so much respect for Gay.

09:06.754 --> 09:10.716
We have a great relationship,
and a trusting relationship.

09:13.803 --> 09:17.181
To me, he was like a god.

09:21.102 --> 09:24.522
Mr. Talese is one of America's
proudest possessions.

09:24.605 --> 09:27.441
As an author,
he wrote The Power and the Glory,

09:27.525 --> 09:29.652
a story inside the New York Times.

09:29.735 --> 09:32.488
You wrote the mafia book,
Honor Thy Father.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.282
- How am I doing?
- It's correct.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.619
Now you're back
with Thy Neighbor's Wife,

09:38.703 --> 09:40.997
an eight-year study
of sexuality in America.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.834
This will be the most talked about book
of the decade.

09:44.917 --> 09:48.045
You were visiting
a place called Sandstone?

09:48.129 --> 09:49.880
It's a nudist commune in Los Angeles.

09:49.964 --> 09:52.883
You actually watched people
and all that stuff?

09:52.967 --> 09:54.802
More than that. I mean...

09:55.344 --> 10:00.016
You know the jokes you'll
face as you start the talk show rounds.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.017
Starting here.

10:02.268 --> 10:07.064
I became a resident writer
in a sexually free society.

10:07.148 --> 10:09.525
We got to have sex with other people.

10:10.067 --> 10:12.903
How did it affect
your sexual life at home?

10:12.987 --> 10:14.280
Was it...

10:17.658 --> 10:21.120
My wife was very unhappy,
as you can imagine.

10:21.203 --> 10:23.956
We have daughters.
We're known in our community.

10:24.040 --> 10:27.126
It seemed like I was doing
a reprehensible thing.

10:27.209 --> 10:30.004
Say hello to Nan Talese. Mrs. Talese.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.924
What I really minded
was the press about it.

10:35.718 --> 10:38.929
And I wanted to protect
Catherine and Pamela,

10:39.013 --> 10:41.557
and not have it hurt them.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.393
I thought of myself at the front door,

10:44.477 --> 10:48.397
with my arms just not letting them
into our house.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.692
Is that about it for Gay's sex research?

10:51.776 --> 10:56.197
It's not up to me. A person does
what he feels is right to do.

10:56.280 --> 10:59.075
I sold my soul, if you wanna put it
that way. I don't care.

10:59.158 --> 11:01.744
I wanted the story.
I would've done anything for it.

11:01.827 --> 11:04.872
I felt I had to do it.
I had to go on the record.

11:05.581 --> 11:07.708
I was there. I was participating.

11:07.792 --> 11:11.337
I wasn't sitting in the press box
with a press card around my naked body.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.589
For me, it wasn't a big thing,

11:13.672 --> 11:16.967
'cause I had always had
this second sense of self.

11:17.843 --> 11:22.223
I wanted the truth, and in this book,
being a nonfiction writer, a reporter,

11:22.306 --> 11:23.265
I got the truth.

11:23.349 --> 11:26.477
How do you get the truth?
You have to participate, to be there.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.896
You can't listen to what people say.
It's what they do.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.611
In 1980...

11:36.404 --> 11:38.280
I flew out to see him.

11:38.364 --> 11:41.909
I wanted to be sure
this guy wasn't lying to me.

11:42.701 --> 11:47.957
As a guest of the voyeur,
I was gonna be a companion of the voyeur.

11:52.169 --> 11:54.839
I went up one night and did watch.

11:54.922 --> 11:56.382
He said, "I'll take you up."

11:57.550 --> 12:00.136
Through the utility room,

12:00.219 --> 12:02.596
you go up to the ladder
and you get to a landing.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.640
You go back, and there's a locked door.

12:04.723 --> 12:07.518
That's the door to the attic,
and only he had the key.

12:08.352 --> 12:11.272
We went inside.
He then locked the door behind me.

12:17.778 --> 12:20.614
You could see light coming up
from certain spots.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.078
You're hearing televisions.

12:28.289 --> 12:29.540
Voices.

12:32.626 --> 12:35.796
He leaned over in one spot
where there was light...

12:37.006 --> 12:38.215
and he pointed down,

12:38.299 --> 12:42.595
and we looked upon a very good-looking
couple engaged in oral sex.

12:44.638 --> 12:47.308
He made a kind of sign like that.

12:48.309 --> 12:51.061
I leaned closer and closer,

12:51.145 --> 12:52.855
watching intently.

12:55.441 --> 12:59.653
And then I felt a man's hand on my neck.

13:00.821 --> 13:03.782
It was the voyeur
who crawled around and pulled me up...

13:04.992 --> 13:08.287
very quietly but firmly.

13:08.370 --> 13:09.830
I looked at him.

13:10.789 --> 13:14.210
And that damn tie of mine,
my red silk tie,

13:14.293 --> 13:16.712
was only a couple of feet
from the head of the woman

13:16.795 --> 13:19.757
giving a blow job to this guy on his bed.

13:20.341 --> 13:21.592
Jesus!

13:22.218 --> 13:24.553
He said, "You have to be careful
with that tie."

13:35.648 --> 13:39.276
I would never write about him
unless I could use his name.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.612
There's no point, as a nonfiction writer,

13:41.695 --> 13:45.282
in writing about personal life
unless you use real names.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.367
Otherwise, write fiction.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.536
So, he wasn't buying this,

13:48.619 --> 13:51.413
but he was continuing
to cooperate with me.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.624
And this continued for more than 30 years.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.793
Let me see what I can find here.

13:56.418 --> 14:00.089
Letters. Look at this.
I have copies of every letter.

14:00.881 --> 14:04.677
The problem in journalism,
it takes place in too short a period.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.846
Reporters go and talk to somebody today,
and they never see them again.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.265
Interview, in and out.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.850
I don't do that. I like to keep in touch,

14:11.934 --> 14:15.521
because there are chances,
maybe two or three decades later,

14:15.604 --> 14:17.481
where you can go back
and see these people,

14:17.565 --> 14:20.526
and you can find out
what happened after you left off.

14:21.861 --> 14:27.074
I called up this guy and I said,
"I think you're about ready to do it."

14:27.157 --> 14:31.120
He says, "I sold my motel in 1997."

14:31.787 --> 14:34.582
The statute of limitations
probably allows me...

14:34.665 --> 14:37.793
And most of those people
are dead anyway or...

14:37.877 --> 14:39.211
"And I, at 78..."

14:39.295 --> 14:42.047
I said, "I'm 80,
so if you're gonna do it, do it fast",

14:42.131 --> 14:43.799
'cause neither of us will be
around much longer."

14:48.637 --> 14:54.268
My story about the voyeur, Gerald Foos,
is gonna be excerpted in the New Yorker,

14:54.351 --> 14:58.439
followed by a book publisher,
Grove Atlantic of New York,

14:58.522 --> 14:59.815
is gonna publish a book.

15:01.775 --> 15:02.776
Hi, there.

15:02.860 --> 15:06.739
Susan Morrison, you're so famous,
except with the guys downstairs.

15:07.865 --> 15:12.828
Those guys at the reception desk
never heard of the New Yorker.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.372
His name is Foos, Gerald Foos. F-O-O-S.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.583
He was never caught.

15:17.666 --> 15:21.587
- You met him after Thy Neighbor's Wife?
- After I had finished it.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.923
It was in the papers.
I had a lot of publicity.

15:24.006 --> 15:26.926
He happened to read something
in the Denver Post.

15:27.009 --> 15:29.136
He's still very willing and interested...

15:29.219 --> 15:32.097
Yeah, I have him down.
I just cannot get...

15:32.181 --> 15:35.809
I don't wanna do anything else
till I finish this, because...

15:35.893 --> 15:37.436
I don't want him to die, number one.

15:37.519 --> 15:39.605
- How old is he?
- 78.

15:39.688 --> 15:41.815
Of course, I'm 81,
so I should worry about my...

15:41.899 --> 15:44.443
One of us is gonna die soon,
so I wanna get this done first.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.487
Here's what I'm worried about.

15:46.570 --> 15:49.657
If I tell the reader
that I'm watching something...

15:49.740 --> 15:53.661
I saw a little sex, but...
For me, I'm so jaded on that.

15:53.744 --> 15:58.165
But if I say that I didn't see anything,
the reader is gonna lose interest.

15:58.248 --> 15:59.875
- Oh, no. Don't worry.
- That's all.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.419
In a way, I'm glad
that you didn't see anything so great,

16:02.503 --> 16:06.799
because I think you run the risk
of it seeming almost too creepy.

16:06.882 --> 16:09.134
That's another thing.
This guy is not creepy.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.637
This is really what I have to explain.

16:11.720 --> 16:15.182
This guy is a square guy.

16:15.265 --> 16:18.894
If you didn't know he's a voyeur,
he could be working for Avis Rent-a-Car.

16:18.978 --> 16:23.273
He could be selling insurance.
Anybody. He's everyman. Nobody.

16:24.566 --> 16:25.776
That's all.

16:31.991 --> 16:36.370
Gerald, tell me how it was
you first started as a voyeur.

16:37.663 --> 16:42.960
I was on a farm with my mother
and father, east of Ault, Colorado.

16:43.043 --> 16:46.296
And we lived
right straight across the street

16:46.380 --> 16:49.633
from my mother's sister, Katheryn Eckhart.

16:49.717 --> 16:53.178
She was younger,
and she was different in body type,

16:53.762 --> 16:55.097
and she had freckles.

16:56.598 --> 17:01.979
I never really knew what freckles were
in those days, but I wanted to find out.

17:02.062 --> 17:04.647
She was, I gather,
a very attractive woman.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.150
She was beautiful.

17:06.233 --> 17:09.778
From my eyes, the most beautiful woman
I ever laid eyes on.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.821
- Is that right?
- Yes, she was.

17:12.531 --> 17:17.118
I think I had gone to bed
approximately nine o'clock in the evening.

17:17.953 --> 17:21.957
And as I sat there on the bed,
suddenly I get this urge.

17:22.624 --> 17:25.544
I went to the window
and I looked out across the street,

17:25.627 --> 17:28.005
and it was like a compelling force.

17:28.088 --> 17:32.342
I could see right straight
to my aunt Katheryn's bedroom window.

17:32.426 --> 17:37.097
A mysterious force captivated
my entire body.

17:37.681 --> 17:40.225
I think it was
because I was entering puberty.

17:42.311 --> 17:45.898
And now, what beckoned to me
was the window.

17:46.482 --> 17:47.983
God, that's good. The beckoning window.

17:48.067 --> 17:51.487
I don't know... There's got
to be other words to describe that.

17:51.570 --> 17:55.616
Beckoning window is perfect.
You don't even know you're a poet.

17:55.699 --> 17:57.534
You'll come up with other words.

17:57.618 --> 18:00.037
No, I don't have to. That's the best word.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.872
Beckoning window, right?

18:01.955 --> 18:03.749
Anita, what do you think?
Good word, right?

18:03.832 --> 18:04.875
Mmm-hmm.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.127
I finally got to the window.

18:07.836 --> 18:13.300
- In those days, nobody pulled shades down.
- I didn't know that. That's true?

18:13.383 --> 18:15.636
- There was a mirror.
- Mirror?

18:15.719 --> 18:18.514
Now, I could look from here
into that mirror

18:18.597 --> 18:21.350
and see everything she was doing
in her room.

18:21.433 --> 18:25.354
She had beautiful red hair at that time.
Her pubic region was...

18:25.896 --> 18:28.982
- Red.
- Very red, and she had big boobs.

18:29.066 --> 18:29.900
Oh, my God.

18:29.983 --> 18:34.655
Which became the reason
that I have had a fixation on boobs.

18:34.738 --> 18:36.031
No question about it.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.991
This is where you started masturbating.

18:38.075 --> 18:41.662
This woman is the obsession
of your masturbatory dreams.

18:41.745 --> 18:42.830
They're gonna say,

18:42.913 --> 18:46.834
"It's amazing, the voyeur started out
like that? Is that what caused..."

18:46.917 --> 18:50.546
Psychiatrists are gonna be
scratching their head...

18:50.629 --> 18:52.923
You're gonna be famous
in all the medical journals.

18:53.006 --> 18:56.385
They may wanna talk to me,
but I'll say, "Well..."

18:56.468 --> 18:59.805
open your check book,
and we'll have a conversation.

18:59.888 --> 19:02.015
"I don't talk to nobody
unless they pay me."

19:02.099 --> 19:05.435
That's not a bad...
You're a very American fellow.

19:07.187 --> 19:09.273
When you got mixed up with me,

19:10.149 --> 19:11.775
you wrote me a long letter,

19:11.859 --> 19:15.737
and at that time you wanted
to share this with me,

19:15.821 --> 19:19.032
but you didn't want me to write about you,
at least by name.

19:19.116 --> 19:20.826
That was the deal we had.

19:22.035 --> 19:24.746
And a question is,
why did you even write me?

19:25.581 --> 19:30.377
I think I was attempting
to gain some kind of notoriety,

19:30.460 --> 19:35.048
because I did something that no one else
had ever accomplished or ever did.

19:35.132 --> 19:39.011
- Or ever thought about doing.
- And I hoped that they don't...

19:39.094 --> 19:41.138
The only thing
that they have in their mind

19:41.221 --> 19:44.600
is the fact that I may be a pervert
and a Peeping Tom.

19:44.683 --> 19:48.478
Because I wasn't that.
I was actually a researcher.

19:48.562 --> 19:51.064
How many times did I tell you
that I was a researcher?

19:51.148 --> 19:51.982
A lot.

19:52.065 --> 19:54.902
I said I was a researcher,
and I believe that.

19:59.281 --> 20:01.200
We said to Gay,
"We want you to see"

20:01.283 --> 20:05.370
if you could get Foos to be reflective
at all about all of this,

20:05.454 --> 20:09.625
if he had any misgivings about it,
why he decided to come clean,

20:09.708 --> 20:11.752
"what he thought
his actual contribution was."

20:11.835 --> 20:14.755
He thought of himself as a researcher.

20:14.838 --> 20:16.131
A ridiculous claim.

20:16.215 --> 20:21.970
To me, there's never been any question
that Foos is really disturbed.

20:22.054 --> 20:27.935
A certain kind of sociopath
who just needed the attention.

20:30.312 --> 20:35.859
But taken as a whole, this document
that Foos has produced over decades,

20:35.943 --> 20:38.237
it's so completely fascinating.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.698
Full of strange, weird details.

20:41.782 --> 20:44.910
It's an amazing snapshot
of the American condition

20:44.993 --> 20:49.373
that is interesting
and newsworthy in itself.

20:51.458 --> 20:55.796
In 1980, he promised he would show me
the many written pages

20:55.879 --> 20:59.508
that he had accumulated
on yellow-lined, legal-size pads.

20:59.591 --> 21:04.596
"Approximately 35 years old, white male,
5'10", 180, white collar.

21:04.680 --> 21:08.976
Wife, 35, 5'4",
pleasingly plump, dark hair.

21:09.059 --> 21:11.103
Looks like Italian extraction. Educated."

21:11.186 --> 21:12.813
Somebody else moves in.

21:12.896 --> 21:14.606
"Unknown female companion.

21:14.690 --> 21:17.651
30-year-old black male.
Employment unknown."

21:17.734 --> 21:18.902
There's a little sex here.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.446
Every once in a while, you get a summary.

21:21.530 --> 21:24.449
"Oral sex without intercourse, five."

21:24.533 --> 21:26.118
Intercourse only, 29.

21:26.201 --> 21:29.371
Masturbation only, 1.
Resulting male orgasm, 35.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.039
"Resulting female orgasm, seven."

21:31.123 --> 21:34.084
Shows you how women don't have
that much fun.

21:38.130 --> 21:44.136
You had watched perhaps between 2,000
and 3,000 people a year.

21:44.219 --> 21:45.220
Mmm-hmm.

21:46.013 --> 21:49.683
- Putting in a lot of time, too.
- Oh, till daylight.

21:52.811 --> 21:55.564
Donna used to come up and bring me a Coke.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.899
- Sometimes even bring me a sandwich.
- Right.

21:57.983 --> 21:59.026
Because she knew I was up there.

21:59.109 --> 22:02.195
Said, "Poor old Gerald, he's up there,
and he hasn't eaten."

22:02.779 --> 22:06.616
You can only masturbate, how many times,
a couple times a night?

22:06.700 --> 22:09.328
When you were younger,
you can do it three, four, maybe five.

22:10.787 --> 22:13.290
I got interested in certain people.

22:16.543 --> 22:19.338
And, of course,
I knew who was in the rooms.

22:20.005 --> 22:23.925
I used to keep them there,
as much as I could. I gave them low rates.

22:24.968 --> 22:30.140
One time he's watching a couple
that were very attractive.

22:38.774 --> 22:41.693
He's looking forward
with much anticipation

22:42.360 --> 22:45.447
toward a really good show of sex.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.993
Just as they're about
to take off their clothes,

22:50.911 --> 22:52.662
the guy turned off the lights

22:53.371 --> 22:55.665
and the television set.

22:55.749 --> 22:59.920
And the voyeur is more than disappointed.
He's angry.

23:00.003 --> 23:03.381
They betrayed his anticipation.
And what does he do?

23:03.465 --> 23:05.759
I went down the ladder and got in my car.

23:06.343 --> 23:12.057
He puts on the bright headlights,
parks it right outside the window.

23:13.433 --> 23:16.061
Then he goes upstairs.
Now he can see them.

23:22.692 --> 23:26.905
The guy sees the lights blazing
through the drawn curtains,

23:26.988 --> 23:30.158
and he says,
"Some dumb bastard left his lights on."

23:34.663 --> 23:39.126
In his notes, he refers to himself often
as the voyeur in the third person.

23:42.129 --> 23:48.176
On the observation platform,
the voyeur is a distinct, separate entity.

23:48.260 --> 23:52.013
And I think we exist side by side.

23:53.849 --> 23:56.518
The kind of hours that you spend...

23:56.601 --> 23:59.729
Doesn't mean you're watching scenes
from Deep Throat.

23:59.813 --> 24:01.648
It's not hard-core porno.

24:02.190 --> 24:05.777
You do see sex,
but not as often as you would think.

24:08.655 --> 24:10.490
It isn't boring.

24:10.574 --> 24:13.618
In fact, it's worse than that. It's real.

24:14.953 --> 24:16.496
Life is tedious.

24:17.581 --> 24:21.710
It's people expressing
the tedium of ordinary life.

24:23.128 --> 24:24.963
And even though it's boring to him,
he writes it down,

24:25.046 --> 24:27.424
which is what's valuable
about his document.

24:28.675 --> 24:31.887
Among the hundreds
and hundreds of stories,

24:31.970 --> 24:36.141
there were cases
where people were fairly bizarre.

24:36.224 --> 24:38.727
One time he was in the office
and the cleaning lady said,

24:38.810 --> 24:41.438
"Listen, there must be a sheep
in one of those rooms,

24:41.521 --> 24:42.939
'cause all I hear is bah, bah."

24:43.607 --> 24:47.319
And so he goes up in the ladder,
and he sees two men,

24:47.402 --> 24:49.279
one of them dressed in sheep's clothing,

24:49.362 --> 24:52.073
and the other guy is on top of him,
having sex,

24:52.741 --> 24:55.243
and he's making these sheep sounds.

24:56.077 --> 25:01.124
I had an individual come
into my motel, had a bucket of chicken

25:01.875 --> 25:03.960
from the colonel.

25:05.670 --> 25:10.967
Sat down on the bed,
pulled out about that thick of napkins,

25:11.051 --> 25:13.762
and set 'em over here
on the side of the bed,

25:13.845 --> 25:17.390
and then proceeded to eat this chicken.

25:17.474 --> 25:19.476
Sometimes that made me hungry.

25:19.559 --> 25:22.020
And then, of course, his hands were...

25:22.103 --> 25:26.233
What did he do? He just reached down
and picked up the bedspread...

25:28.318 --> 25:30.946
He got so angry,
he said, "Son of a bitch!"

25:31.029 --> 25:31.947
Son of a bitch!

25:32.030 --> 25:33.531
And he goes, "Who said that?"

25:34.157 --> 25:35.450
He went to the window

25:35.533 --> 25:38.411
and he pulled back the drape
and he looks down this way,

25:38.495 --> 25:40.455
then he looks down that way.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.624
Ain't nobody there.

25:42.707 --> 25:46.127
He was not discovered,
but that's the one time he lost his cool.

25:47.128 --> 25:50.173
The thing that used to anger me
more than anything is dogs.

25:50.257 --> 25:52.467
I used to hate 'em
when they were in the rooms.

25:53.051 --> 25:55.512
And as he's up there,
quiet as he is,

25:55.595 --> 25:57.639
not even hardly breathing
if he can help it,

25:57.722 --> 26:00.100
the dog sometimes would catch...

26:00.183 --> 26:02.310
They'd sit there and look.

26:02.394 --> 26:07.148
He could hear anything.
That little sucker knew about it.

26:10.318 --> 26:13.613
Some days I'd be depressed,
because here's what happens...

26:15.490 --> 26:19.244
I'd go up there at night,
and I'd go from one room to the next.

26:20.328 --> 26:27.168
And the only thing I was hearing was
shouting, hollering, complaining, cursing.

26:28.712 --> 26:31.172
All that kind of stuff really bothers me.

26:31.256 --> 26:35.218
By watching different people doing things
that I didn't think was appropriate,

26:35.302 --> 26:39.681
I developed the distaste
for a lot of people.

26:39.764 --> 26:45.228
He really became somewhat cynical.
He wanted to entrap people.

26:47.188 --> 26:50.525
The first thing I started doing
was planting dildos.

26:52.527 --> 26:55.864
In addition to the Bible that is
usually in one of the bedside tables,

26:55.947 --> 26:58.658
this voyeur put porno magazines.

26:58.742 --> 27:02.954
I wanted to find out
whether they'd utilize what I planted,

27:03.038 --> 27:04.456
or come up to the office and say,

27:04.539 --> 27:07.709
"Hey, clean your rooms out.
Get one of your maids."

27:07.792 --> 27:10.420
I had a couple of women and men do that.

27:11.379 --> 27:13.298
But the women that utilized it?

27:14.924 --> 27:16.593
That was a different story.

27:17.302 --> 27:20.138
Gerald Foos conducted a test

27:20.221 --> 27:25.518
where he left a small suitcase
in a closet of one of the 12 rooms,

27:25.602 --> 27:29.647
and when the person, or persons,
came in to register in the office,

27:29.731 --> 27:33.026
the voyeur would pick up the phone
and talk to his wife.

27:33.610 --> 27:37.864
"I had a call from a person
who's left a suitcase with $1,000,"

27:37.947 --> 27:39.366
and it's left in a room.

27:39.449 --> 27:42.702
"Do you have any record
of anybody finding that?"

27:42.786 --> 27:44.621
Then they'd go to the room.

27:44.704 --> 27:47.415
As they were hanging up their clothes,
they saw this suitcase.

27:47.499 --> 27:50.960
It had a very small lock,
easily could be broken.

27:51.044 --> 27:55.131
And I was sitting up there watching them,
looking out of the thing.

27:55.215 --> 27:57.550
Then what do they do?
They broke the damn lock.

27:57.634 --> 28:00.261
Now what do they do?
They had to get rid of the suitcase.

28:00.345 --> 28:03.264
They would sneak the suitcase
out of the room,

28:03.348 --> 28:06.267
put it in the trunk of their car,
drive it off really quick.

28:06.351 --> 28:10.605
One person threw it out
the bathroom window.

28:17.570 --> 28:20.698
You're beautiful. The
handsome gentleman to my right is Tony.

28:21.282 --> 28:22.826
- Hey!
- What are you gonna do?

28:22.909 --> 28:24.619
So much of the time...

28:26.621 --> 28:28.123
a voyeur invests...

28:29.416 --> 28:32.335
is propelled by anticipation.

28:35.839 --> 28:40.343
And you're hoping they will do something
to make your time worthwhile.

28:42.262 --> 28:43.972
That's a lot of investment, a lot of time,

28:44.055 --> 28:46.266
and a very small return
on your investment,

28:46.349 --> 28:49.936
except once in a while you see a murder.

28:52.272 --> 28:56.651
I'm concerned about lots of things,
and I predicted things.

28:56.735 --> 29:01.030
I think I could be implicated,
and maybe accessory to a crime.

29:04.200 --> 29:10.540
I was observing, and there was
a white male and a white female.

29:11.416 --> 29:13.001
He was a drug dealer.

29:15.378 --> 29:19.591
I saw him distribute
and sell drugs to kids.

29:20.925 --> 29:24.888
He hid 'em in a register
that was along the wall.

29:24.971 --> 29:27.682
Screwed it out
and put 'em in behind a register.

29:29.976 --> 29:32.103
That's where he had his stash.

29:33.229 --> 29:36.149
The voyeur, who had a son
who had a drug problem,

29:36.232 --> 29:38.485
was angry at seeing drugs sold.

29:39.110 --> 29:42.781
And when he left the room,
guess what I did?

29:44.199 --> 29:46.868
I went in there and screwed 'em off
and took the stash

29:46.951 --> 29:48.870
and flushed it down the toilet.

29:50.622 --> 29:53.833
When he came back that night,
he went over to the thing and...

29:57.921 --> 30:01.508
When he pulled that sack out
and there was nothing in there,

30:01.591 --> 30:03.176
he started blaming people.

30:03.259 --> 30:04.803
He said, "Who the hell was in here?"

30:05.470 --> 30:08.640
The only person who knew
where he hid it was his girlfriend.

30:08.723 --> 30:12.018
And he accuses her,
and she quickly denies it,

30:12.101 --> 30:13.853
but he insists that it must've been her.

30:13.937 --> 30:16.356
Who else knew? "Wasn't me."
"Yes, it was."

30:16.940 --> 30:19.234
She says,
"I don't know anything about it."

30:19.317 --> 30:21.402
Starts slapping her around.

30:25.198 --> 30:27.617
She stood up and was in his face.

30:27.700 --> 30:30.954
He slaps her. "I wanna know. Where is it?"
She kicks him in the groin.

30:32.622 --> 30:33.998
And he just got crazy.

30:34.624 --> 30:38.044
He reached up and grabbed her
by the neck and choked her.

30:38.127 --> 30:40.129
And just kept choking her.
I said, "Come on."

30:40.213 --> 30:43.675
I was thinking, "Come on, let her go.
Let her go, man."

30:44.259 --> 30:47.887
And pretty soon he just quit,
and she fell to the floor.

30:53.184 --> 30:56.062
Fell right in front of the vent,
so I was looking straight down.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.524
And I swear to you,

30:59.607 --> 31:03.778
I could see her chest rising,
up and down, up and down.

31:03.862 --> 31:07.949
And then he got all angry.
He was throwing things around the room.

31:08.616 --> 31:11.327
He picked up her purse
and dumped it out on the bed

31:11.411 --> 31:13.454
and took all the money she had.

31:14.539 --> 31:17.083
Out the door. Into the car and gone.

31:25.508 --> 31:28.928
This guy up there,
the voyeur is watching this...

31:29.888 --> 31:31.848
and, of course, doing nothing.

31:32.432 --> 31:38.479
He was stilled, he was confused,
he was frozen into inactivity.

31:38.563 --> 31:41.357
And I looked and I swear...

31:41.441 --> 31:44.819
I swear to God
that I saw her chest moving.

31:45.987 --> 31:48.281
And I thought, "Well, she's okay."

31:51.200 --> 31:52.201
So I left.

31:52.285 --> 31:56.664
Fact is, that made me so sick
that I quit observations for the night.

32:03.046 --> 32:06.424
The next morning, maid came to work,

32:06.507 --> 32:09.427
and I watched her
as she went down the rooms.

32:09.510 --> 32:12.180
And then pretty soon
she came to that room,

32:12.263 --> 32:14.933
and she opened the door and she went in.

32:19.062 --> 32:21.981
All of a sudden, she came running out.
I said, "Oh, no."

32:22.065 --> 32:24.692
She came running into the office.
She said, "Gerald..."

32:24.776 --> 32:28.071
I think the lady in number ten is dead."

32:28.154 --> 32:32.033
Donna came in and said,
"She's dead, Gerald. She's dead."

32:34.243 --> 32:35.495
The police came...

32:36.788 --> 32:39.582
and pretty soon the coroner shows up
in his little panel truck.

32:39.666 --> 32:41.334
And I'm going, "Oh."

32:42.293 --> 32:45.588
- "I'm sick." Gay, you know?
- Yeah.

32:45.672 --> 32:48.758
And I'm saying,
"I could be responsible for that."

32:54.222 --> 32:58.393
We have a deal.
This man, Gerald Foos, and I have a deal.

32:58.476 --> 33:02.397
That is for me to tell the truth
and him to live with it.

33:04.357 --> 33:07.026
The motel, he doesn't own it now.

33:07.110 --> 33:11.823
In 1997, he sold it to a Korean family
that has no idea what was going on.

33:11.906 --> 33:15.994
When he sold it, he made sure
he took his magical vents with him.

33:16.077 --> 33:18.371
He told me it was completely covered up.

33:18.454 --> 33:21.624
That's a pretty sloppy job, Gerald.
Look at that.

33:24.127 --> 33:30.550
There's situations that could
result in me being jailed, I don't know.

33:31.259 --> 33:34.679
I just feel uneasy and I feel nervous.

33:36.014 --> 33:40.393
When we first started discussing this
a year ago, we thought it was time

33:40.476 --> 33:44.105
because the statute of limitation
has potentially passed.

33:44.188 --> 33:47.233
But now I've found out
there's a new word called...

33:47.316 --> 33:49.193
Uh... uh...

33:49.986 --> 33:53.281
Whatever, but I'm the guy
they're going to indict, not you.

33:53.364 --> 33:55.408
- Because I...
- That's what you're telling me...

33:55.491 --> 33:57.827
I'll tell you something.
This letter that you wrote me,

33:57.910 --> 33:58.995
I read this morning.

33:59.078 --> 34:01.247
In this letter, you warn me

34:01.330 --> 34:04.500
that you don't want the name
of the Manor House Motel published.

34:04.584 --> 34:06.252
You said if this happens,

34:06.335 --> 34:08.420
this Korean guy,
who has not a clue what happened,

34:08.504 --> 34:12.759
is gonna potentially lose customers,
and that could cause damages.

34:12.842 --> 34:16.679
I also talk about
what's gonna happen to Anita and me.

34:18.681 --> 34:22.226
You would think
that I'd gotten this across to him.

34:22.310 --> 34:25.897
I wouldn't have talked to him
if I didn't have permission.

34:27.315 --> 34:30.109
It would've been no deal,
as it had been for 30-plus years,

34:30.193 --> 34:31.694
so there's no change in my policy.

34:31.777 --> 34:36.074
But suddenly this guy is forgetting
what we've agreed to.

34:40.244 --> 34:43.456
If you have no trust
between your source and yourself,

34:43.539 --> 34:45.373
you're in real trouble.

34:47.460 --> 34:50.254
After you've won
the confidence of someone,

34:50.338 --> 34:53.800
then you have to show
enormous amount of patience.

34:54.801 --> 34:57.720
You're also not interested
in making their life

34:57.804 --> 34:59.889
any more difficult than it may be.

35:03.559 --> 35:07.647
- Jerry, I've been doing this all my life.
- I know you have.

35:07.730 --> 35:09.107
It's second nature.

35:09.857 --> 35:11.275
There she is.

35:12.068 --> 35:18.449
Anita, she had had a marriage
to a trucker, some truck driver.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.326
And he was a rough character.

35:20.409 --> 35:23.246
She had two children.
One of them was born crippled.

35:24.247 --> 35:27.375
So their lives, these two wives of Gerald,

35:27.458 --> 35:32.380
and his own life,
filled with sadness and illness.

35:32.463 --> 35:38.553
When you think about what
they have going for them,

35:38.636 --> 35:40.054
it isn't a lot.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.561
I'll turn her off.

35:47.353 --> 35:50.481
We got several alarm systems
to protect our house.

35:51.649 --> 35:53.025
And... Go in.

35:53.109 --> 35:54.861
You don't have
a surveillance camera, do you?

35:54.944 --> 35:57.363
No, no surveillance.
I don't have one of those.

35:57.446 --> 35:58.447
That's too bad.

36:01.784 --> 36:04.203
Anita and I don't have
any housekeepers or anything.

36:04.287 --> 36:05.705
We're not here for that.

36:05.788 --> 36:08.541
Why don't we start here
with the Barbie dolls?

36:08.624 --> 36:09.584
All right.

36:10.376 --> 36:12.420
These are a couple of interesting dolls.

36:13.045 --> 36:15.548
He's an extremist in his obsessions.

36:15.631 --> 36:19.844
These are the coins
that Anita has ecclected just this year.

36:19.927 --> 36:21.137
Jesus!

36:21.220 --> 36:23.598
When he was a boy,
one of the things he did notice

36:23.681 --> 36:26.142
in addition to the body
of this beautiful aunt he had,

36:26.225 --> 36:27.768
was she collected things.

36:28.352 --> 36:29.770
This is my stamp collection.

36:29.854 --> 36:32.857
- There's this drawer. There's this drawer.
- Oh, my God!

36:32.940 --> 36:36.194
He told his mother
he would like to start collecting things

36:36.277 --> 36:37.987
like beautiful Aunt Katheryn.

36:38.070 --> 36:42.325
This started his lifelong hobby
of collecting things.

36:42.408 --> 36:45.036
I have two Lugers here.

36:45.119 --> 36:47.079
When you had a motel,
you used to carry a gun.

36:47.163 --> 36:49.415
I carry guns all the time.

36:50.458 --> 36:54.629
The entire basement area,
you think you're in a museum.

36:55.504 --> 36:58.132
How many cards? Your total collection.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.092
About two to three million.

37:00.176 --> 37:01.260
- Cards?
- Cards.

37:01.344 --> 37:03.930
There's a million cards right there
I've never even looked at.

37:04.013 --> 37:04.847
Jesus!

37:04.931 --> 37:07.141
I don't even know what's in there.

37:08.184 --> 37:11.187
One of the reasons
he wanted to divulge his story,

37:11.270 --> 37:12.355
because he'd get press attention

37:12.438 --> 37:16.317
and he could brag about
his collection of sports memorabilia,

37:16.400 --> 37:18.027
and he wanted to sell it.

37:18.110 --> 37:20.905
These cards are gonna make us
multi-millionaire,

37:20.988 --> 37:22.657
just the cards themselves.

37:23.616 --> 37:26.494
Now this card, the Mickey Mantle card,

37:26.577 --> 37:30.456
it's worth anywhere
from 200 to a million dollars.

37:30.539 --> 37:33.918
And I once had over a thousand of 'em.

37:34.001 --> 37:38.381
He has these prices he keeps quoting,
and I don't know, is this guy nuts?

37:38.464 --> 37:41.259
But on the other hand,
I don't know. I'm not a collector.

37:41.342 --> 37:43.970
This card here could be worth 500 grand.

37:44.053 --> 37:45.680
- Oh, my God.
- Maybe more.

37:45.763 --> 37:47.181
And who is it?

37:47.265 --> 37:49.809
How do I know what these things are worth?

37:49.892 --> 37:51.852
How do I know
if he's totally exaggerating?

37:51.936 --> 37:52.853
I don't know.

37:53.479 --> 37:56.440
If I reflect that he's a braggart,

37:56.524 --> 38:00.736
then that might reflect on
all that I believed of what he saw.

38:00.820 --> 38:05.491
The thing you gotta know in life is
when to make a choice and when not to.

38:06.284 --> 38:09.745
I can definitely testify
to the accuracy of the room.

38:09.829 --> 38:13.082
I mean the attic. I know that was...
I saw it. I was there.

38:15.960 --> 38:19.922
But the rest of it, I'm getting from him,
and he's my single source.

38:20.006 --> 38:22.633
And you're unwise to have one source.

38:36.272 --> 38:37.356
In all that I write,

38:37.440 --> 38:40.901
I try to guard against
being wrong about something

38:40.985 --> 38:45.740
that could be checked upon
and found part of sloppy reporting.

38:45.823 --> 38:49.160
The issue of that murder.
It's unresolved as of now.

38:50.036 --> 38:52.455
I know the date, the year.

38:52.538 --> 38:58.419
A woman in her mid-20s, or maybe younger
or maybe older, was found dead.

38:59.128 --> 39:02.715
We have to find out
who in the hell that person was.

39:03.632 --> 39:04.759
I'd love to have that,

39:05.343 --> 39:08.054
because there's gonna be
a lot of skepticism

39:08.137 --> 39:10.222
about the veracity of this.

39:11.015 --> 39:13.267
I went to the police,
I went to the coroner,

39:13.351 --> 39:15.644
and I went to the newspaper,
the Denver Post.

39:16.312 --> 39:20.191
They checked on their records,
and they came back and said,

39:20.274 --> 39:23.986
"We don't have anything about this death."

39:24.070 --> 39:26.322
How could they not have records?

39:27.698 --> 39:29.658
I don't know how it's possible.

39:30.284 --> 39:32.203
They would have to have records.

39:33.704 --> 39:36.248
I shouldn't have to search far.

39:36.332 --> 39:39.835
You should just have the date,
the location of the death.

39:39.919 --> 39:41.754
There should be somebody

39:41.837 --> 39:47.802
meeting the description of a woman
dying on a motel floor...

39:49.345 --> 39:53.641
and be that age, 20 to 30.
It shouldn't be...

39:53.724 --> 39:54.809
I think we're here.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.770
Thank you.

40:00.189 --> 40:01.607
Right here, please.

40:02.608 --> 40:04.443
- Keep walking, Mr. Talese.
- Thank you.

40:09.448 --> 40:12.451
Jamison Stoltz,
the editor working on the book,

40:12.535 --> 40:17.081
uncovered a murder that occurred
a couple of miles away in a motel

40:17.164 --> 40:18.749
within a two or three week period.

40:21.335 --> 40:24.338
This came out because
I was looking for more information,

40:24.422 --> 40:27.883
just as you were,
on the murder that he writes about.

40:36.725 --> 40:39.103
Could Gerald have
conflated this?

40:39.687 --> 40:41.480
I don't know the answer.

40:41.564 --> 40:44.316
I don't think the actual total truth

40:44.400 --> 40:46.694
of all these incidents
are ever gonna be known.

40:46.777 --> 40:48.571
The only person that knows them is Gerald,

40:48.654 --> 40:51.699
and he may not even know them,
because he may not remember them.

40:51.782 --> 40:55.161
I really like this line,
"I don't keep secrets from my readers."

40:55.244 --> 40:57.830
As he put it, she fell through the cracks.

40:57.913 --> 40:58.747
Yeah.

41:00.374 --> 41:05.463
Why would this guy depict himself
in a cowardly way?

41:05.546 --> 41:10.342
Why would a guy make up the worst story
in the book about him?

41:11.343 --> 41:14.597
To repeat that story
is to lose any sympathy

41:14.680 --> 41:18.142
from even the most sympathetic sick reader
I had.

41:20.394 --> 41:23.647
You know,
Gerald's a fascinating character,

41:23.731 --> 41:26.984
but would I stake my life or my reputation

41:27.067 --> 41:30.779
on every single thing that he's recounted
in this story

41:30.863 --> 41:33.699
of being absolutely accurate?
No, I wouldn't.

41:40.247 --> 41:44.251
GT, which is how I refer to him
when I'm not speaking directly to him...

41:45.085 --> 41:47.129
said, "Why don't you do something?"

41:47.213 --> 41:50.132
Why don't you do an illustration
for The Voyeur's Motel?"

41:50.758 --> 41:52.051
Little bit brighter.

41:52.510 --> 41:55.763
This is the sort of thing
you do for your parents.

41:56.514 --> 42:00.809
So he gave me this postcard to work from.
This is a picture that he had.

42:00.893 --> 42:03.646
I didn't like the perspective,
and I didn't want it to be snow,

42:03.729 --> 42:06.649
and I had this idea to look
for other pictures on the Internet.

42:07.316 --> 42:09.693
Let's see if anything comes up.

42:09.777 --> 42:12.613
When I looked at the street view,
this is what I got.

42:13.781 --> 42:15.699
The most recent time.

42:17.535 --> 42:21.664
And I called my father and said,
"Guess what? It's been torn down."

42:21.747 --> 42:22.915
What'd he say?

42:22.998 --> 42:27.127
"How do you know that?
How did you find that out?"

42:27.211 --> 42:29.880
And I said, "Google Maps."
"Oh, you and the Internet!"

42:37.763 --> 42:38.847
Come on.

42:39.431 --> 42:41.433
Jesus! How in the hell...

42:43.060 --> 42:44.228
All right.

42:45.062 --> 42:46.272
- Hello?
- Hello, Gerald?

42:46.355 --> 42:47.565
Hey, Gay.

42:47.648 --> 42:51.485
I heard just last night...

42:52.236 --> 42:55.281
that the Manor House Motel
is not there anymore.

42:55.364 --> 42:57.157
Who told you that?

42:57.241 --> 43:00.953
- It's been leveled.
- Really? That's news to me.

43:01.036 --> 43:04.540
- I'm telling you...
- That's really not a big problem, though.

43:04.623 --> 43:08.043
Wait a minute.
It probably makes you relieved,

43:08.127 --> 43:12.089
because you were the guy told me
don't use the name of that motel.

43:12.172 --> 43:13.007
Yes, I did.

43:13.090 --> 43:16.051
I just told Anita,
and she said that's good.

43:16.135 --> 43:17.052
Yeah, listen...

43:17.136 --> 43:19.930
I don't know.
They probably got a good price for it.

43:20.681 --> 43:22.516
- Listen...
- They probably got...

43:22.600 --> 43:25.227
Probably got a million bucks
for it, easily.

43:25.311 --> 43:27.730
Kind of makes me feel good,
to be honest with you.

43:27.813 --> 43:28.897
Does it?

43:28.981 --> 43:32.610
We don't have to fight
with any of these jerks, you know?

43:32.693 --> 43:35.029
You mean
the Korean people that owned it,

43:35.112 --> 43:36.405
- or whoever owned it.
- That's right.

43:36.488 --> 43:40.492
We got the story written
prior to the demolition of it.

43:40.576 --> 43:44.038
Of course we do, and we have films
and pictures and everything else.

43:44.121 --> 43:46.415
- Even...
- We got all kinds of stuff.

43:46.498 --> 43:50.336
That documentary crew even went in
and took pictures of the rooms

43:50.419 --> 43:54.465
when they were there visiting you
and filming your story.

43:54.548 --> 43:57.593
I'm pretty excited about this book, Gay.

43:57.676 --> 44:00.054
I think this could be
one of your great books.

44:00.137 --> 44:03.515
Well, it's gotta get that New Yorker
to publish it.

44:03.599 --> 44:05.142
In other words, all you're waiting for

44:05.225 --> 44:08.562
is for this thing to be published
by New Yorker magazine,

44:08.646 --> 44:10.648
- and then we can go to town.
- That's what we're waiting for.

44:10.731 --> 44:12.650
- I'll see you.
- This is something to shout,

44:12.733 --> 44:14.151
thank the Lord for.

44:14.234 --> 44:18.447
All right, well, it's a hurray
for you and the motel.

44:18.530 --> 44:19.698
Bye-bye, Gerald.

44:22.284 --> 44:23.369
Okay.

44:24.161 --> 44:27.122
When you hold on to stories,
things change.

44:27.206 --> 44:32.461
When you're writing nonfiction, thinking,
now here this piece was all set.

44:32.544 --> 44:33.504
And then what happens?

44:33.587 --> 44:38.258
The whole location of this story,
the motel itself,

44:38.342 --> 44:40.928
vanishes in space,
so I have to figure it out.

44:41.011 --> 44:43.305
So you don't need to go back
out there to see this lot?

44:43.389 --> 44:45.641
- Would it be worth a trip?
- Yeah.

44:45.724 --> 44:48.102
- Well, for us...
- Would it?

44:48.185 --> 44:51.855
For us, the visual
of an empty lot would be very powerful.

44:51.939 --> 44:55.192
If you're gonna do it,
I might as well go with you.

45:44.074 --> 45:46.368
I can't see much out here
that's remaining.

45:46.452 --> 45:48.036
They cleaned it off pretty good.

45:53.709 --> 45:57.212
I feel a little uncomfortable in this...

45:59.465 --> 46:02.009
I always loved this property,

46:02.092 --> 46:04.803
and I built most of it
with my own two hands.

46:05.679 --> 46:08.724
And now it's gone.

46:11.768 --> 46:14.396
In the Bible, of course,
there's that great saying about

46:14.480 --> 46:17.274
there's a time for everything
under the sun.

46:17.357 --> 46:22.112
And I believe that the time
on this particular motel was up.

46:23.030 --> 46:24.990
- What do you think?
- Sad.

46:25.073 --> 46:26.241
- Still sad?
- Yeah.

46:26.992 --> 46:32.247
Last night I had a dream about this place,
and I cried.

46:32.331 --> 46:34.041
And Gerald says, "What's the matter?"

46:34.124 --> 46:38.045
I said, "Nothing,"
and he said, "What's the matter?"

46:38.128 --> 46:39.671
And I said, "I miss the motel."

46:39.755 --> 46:42.424
And I was dreaming
that I was still working...

46:43.217 --> 46:45.719
"and I felt like it was real."

46:45.802 --> 46:49.598
I woke up, I was in bed sleeping, crying.

46:57.606 --> 47:00.400
Yeah, it's somebody else's
property now.

47:03.320 --> 47:06.365
He used the word "redemption" to me.

47:07.699 --> 47:10.827
He says, "I wanna clear my conscience."

47:12.037 --> 47:16.583
To identify or have people identify him
with this work of some worthiness,

47:18.043 --> 47:20.087
and kind of redeem himself.

47:23.215 --> 47:24.675
We'll see.

47:25.425 --> 47:27.177
Sit down and I'll push your foot over.

47:27.261 --> 47:30.097
Thank you, man. God, you're so kind.

47:30.180 --> 47:33.976
I hope when this is all over,
that you and I and Anita

47:34.059 --> 47:36.228
can be as good as friends
as we are before.

47:36.311 --> 47:38.355
We'd better be better.

47:43.151 --> 47:45.988
I've known this man since 1980.

47:48.365 --> 47:53.328
Going over this man's
massive amount of scribble,

47:53.412 --> 47:55.706
having to clarify what is real
and what's not real,

47:55.789 --> 47:59.376
I'm trying to be as careful
as you humanly can...

48:00.711 --> 48:02.462
with an unreliable person.

48:04.089 --> 48:07.259
When you're dealing with the New Yorker,
you have to get the facts right.

48:07.342 --> 48:10.887
I want the facts right.
But I'm worried about the fact checker.

48:10.971 --> 48:14.433
That goddamn magazine
really has fact checkers.

48:14.516 --> 48:17.436
I do not look with pleasure
upon the future,

48:17.519 --> 48:19.646
when a person on the telephone
from the New Yorker

48:19.730 --> 48:24.484
is gonna be calling him up
and asking him this and this and this.

48:24.568 --> 48:28.322
And half of the time,
he doesn't even know what the facts are.

48:31.158 --> 48:34.077
This is kind of
the ultimate single-source story.

48:36.163 --> 48:39.416
The fact that Gay had actually been
on the premises

48:39.499 --> 48:43.295
and knew that
these viewing platforms existed...

48:43.879 --> 48:47.591
We knew that this guy wasn't making
the thing up out of whole cloth.

48:48.342 --> 48:50.177
But, in a place like the New Yorker,

48:50.260 --> 48:53.305
all the T's have to be crossed
and the I's dotted.

48:53.388 --> 48:55.932
Addresses, dates, spellings of names.

48:56.016 --> 49:00.604
All of those things are gone over
in great detail with our fact checkers.

49:00.687 --> 49:03.398
That's an absolute value
that doesn't change.

49:05.317 --> 49:08.445
The question was,
could we wrestle this thing into something

49:08.528 --> 49:12.699
that didn't rely primarily
on Gerald Foos' notebooks?

49:12.783 --> 49:16.119
Because we did find things
at odds with Gerald's account.

49:17.579 --> 49:21.333
He described buying the motel
in a particular year.

49:22.209 --> 49:24.503
We were able to get the deed of sale,

49:24.586 --> 49:29.966
and we noticed that that didn't align
precisely with the date in his notes.

49:32.094 --> 49:35.889
Whenever we found a discrepancy like that,

49:35.972 --> 49:38.684
we wanted the reader to know
exactly what we knew

49:38.767 --> 49:42.145
in terms of when Gerald had made an error.

49:42.813 --> 49:49.152
We made it clear that all of what he saw,
in our in-house lingo, was sort of on him.

49:52.906 --> 49:58.161
The voyeur tells me he bought
this motel in 1966, and I'm quoting him.

49:58.245 --> 50:04.876
This New Yorker fact checker finds out
he didn't buy the motel till 1969.

50:05.544 --> 50:08.088
God, how... That isn't hard
to keep your record straight.

50:08.171 --> 50:10.590
He should know,
when he gives me information like that,

50:10.674 --> 50:12.509
he should get it right and...
It's like...

50:13.677 --> 50:16.763
Come in. God damn it. I wish...
Open the door!

50:19.599 --> 50:22.227
The guy that does the vetting,
he was saying,

50:22.310 --> 50:25.397
"Are you sure, Gerald, that that's '66?"

50:25.480 --> 50:28.483
And, "Yeah," and he says,
"Well, could it be '69?"

50:28.567 --> 50:34.197
And I says, "Yeah, could be very easily.
One of the nine's could've been inverted."

50:36.658 --> 50:39.161
And... But I said, "I don't know that."

50:39.870 --> 50:42.330
I said, "It's a potentiality."

50:45.041 --> 50:46.793
Oh, man. I called him on that.

50:46.877 --> 50:49.463
"Oh, I'm sorry, I got something wrong.
I lost the papers."

50:49.546 --> 50:52.340
I don't care what papers. You need
to remember when you bought a building.

50:53.049 --> 50:56.928
He started keeping notes in 1966,

50:57.012 --> 51:00.098
and even had specific days
like November 26th,

51:00.182 --> 51:04.603
November 28th and December 4th.
'66, '67, '68.

51:05.604 --> 51:09.649
Was he backtracking or writing fiction?
What was he doing?

51:12.319 --> 51:14.446
It doesn't make any sense.

51:15.030 --> 51:19.367
I'm wondering how firmly
I can rely upon him.

51:21.244 --> 51:24.206
I know the motel is real. I was there.

51:25.040 --> 51:26.500
So he gets dates wrong.

51:26.583 --> 51:29.044
But I don't care
whether he opened the motel

51:29.127 --> 51:35.091
in 1965 or 1966 or 1967 or 1968.
It makes no difference.

51:35.675 --> 51:39.262
He held the motel
for more than 15 to 20 years,

51:39.346 --> 51:42.224
during which time he had a lot of time
to look at a lot of things.

51:43.892 --> 51:46.520
The story is the story, and I'm moving on.

51:50.106 --> 51:52.275
Well, I'm really sore
this morning.

51:52.359 --> 51:54.861
That doesn't bode well,

51:54.945 --> 51:58.907
because whenever I get sore like this,
there's a storm coming in.

52:02.452 --> 52:04.704
Anita and I are just kind of loners.

52:05.372 --> 52:08.041
Yeah, we don't neighbor.

52:08.124 --> 52:12.003
Because we found out,
being in the motel business,

52:12.087 --> 52:14.005
there's no sense in doing it.

52:14.089 --> 52:17.759
Because the only thing you're gonna do
is you're gonna expose yourself,

52:17.843 --> 52:21.805
and all they're gonna do
is talk about you to other neighbors.

52:23.390 --> 52:25.308
That's what neighbors do.

52:29.437 --> 52:32.440
Look, here's a blue jay. You see him?
Two blue jays.

52:33.650 --> 52:35.026
Look at 'em.

52:35.110 --> 52:37.779
They don't know
they're being photographed.

52:39.614 --> 52:41.992
We know nobody's coming to visit us.

52:42.742 --> 52:45.078
Nobody ever comes to our house, right?

52:45.161 --> 52:47.289
- Nobody.
- Except the mailman.

52:47.873 --> 52:50.250
We don't have any friends.

52:50.333 --> 52:52.627
All our friends are dead.

52:53.503 --> 52:55.630
- Your friends.
- Unfortunately, yeah.

53:00.135 --> 53:05.265
You guys will be here when it happens,
and I want you to be here.

53:06.099 --> 53:10.478
I don't want anything... I just, like...
We're all in it together.

53:11.187 --> 53:13.315
And that's it. There's nobody else.

53:21.698 --> 53:26.119
Everybody has been worried
about the damn piece.

53:26.703 --> 53:29.122
I bet the voyeur's worried about it, too.

53:29.205 --> 53:31.207
He's the one that really has a worry.

53:32.375 --> 53:36.338
He's right there
in a little suburb of Denver...

53:37.339 --> 53:39.507
waiting to be crucified.

54:09.579 --> 54:11.373
Here it is,

54:11.456 --> 54:15.877
on the front cover of the New Yorker,
in the most prominent section.

54:16.461 --> 54:23.218
I couldn't imagine a more impressive
layout for a magazine article,

54:23.301 --> 54:27.764
with the voyeur's name, Gerald Foos,
not obscure, but right in the headline.

54:27.847 --> 54:32.852
"Gerald Foos bought a motel in order
to watch his guests having sex.

54:33.436 --> 54:35.271
He saw a lot more than that."

54:35.355 --> 54:36.648
That's a terrific headline.

54:38.149 --> 54:40.652
Even if he hates the article,
he'll love the prominence,

54:40.735 --> 54:44.280
'cause the thing about this guy,
he wanted to be discovered.

54:44.364 --> 54:46.408
If he died, no one would care,
no one would know.

54:46.491 --> 54:47.993
But now if he dies...

54:49.077 --> 54:52.622
this thing will put him on the map.

54:52.706 --> 54:55.000
It will get him an obituary
in the New York Times.

54:55.083 --> 54:56.960
Gerald Foos will get an obituary.

54:57.043 --> 55:00.463
Why? Because he's a voyeur who talked.
Talked to me.

55:00.547 --> 55:03.633
Published in the New Yorker.
There it is.

55:05.552 --> 55:07.137
This one is just chilling.

55:07.220 --> 55:11.683
An Aurora motel owner watched his guests
in some of the most intimate moments

55:11.766 --> 55:13.518
without them even knowing.

55:13.601 --> 55:14.894
It went on for decades.

55:14.978 --> 55:17.647
And it's all detailed
in the New Yorker magazine.

55:17.731 --> 55:22.610
The old Manor House Motel stood right here
at the corner of Colfax and Scranton.

55:22.694 --> 55:24.946
Now, in addition to all the sex

55:25.030 --> 55:27.866
that Gerald Foos claims
he watched happen here,

55:27.949 --> 55:31.369
he said he saw a murder,
but never told police.

55:31.453 --> 55:33.830
- What?
- I did too tell police.

55:33.913 --> 55:36.750
said he received a note from Foos
in 1980

55:36.833 --> 55:41.463
saying he purchased the motel
to satisfy his voyeuristic tendencies.

55:41.546 --> 55:44.174
After installing them,
he hovered above in the attic,

55:44.257 --> 55:46.176
and asked his wife to lie on the bed below

55:46.259 --> 55:49.054
to see if she could see him
through the louvers.

55:49.137 --> 55:50.597
He lives up in Brighton.

55:50.680 --> 55:53.641
Reporting live in Aurora,
Lance Hernandez, Denver7.

55:53.725 --> 55:54.684
I can't believe that.

55:54.768 --> 55:55.852
- What?
- I can't believe that.

55:56.936 --> 56:00.190
Suddenly,
I got a little more shaky.

56:05.487 --> 56:07.614
The man is nervous.

56:08.573 --> 56:12.994
For years, he was hiding in the attic.
Now, he's been pulled out of that.

56:14.037 --> 56:16.372
But he's been instructed,
if that's the word, by me,

56:16.456 --> 56:20.168
"Don't go out, don't answer the door.
Don't answer the phone."

56:22.879 --> 56:25.173
Hello. This is.

56:25.256 --> 56:29.302
It's one of the ladies you'd meet
at the Denver Post with Gay Talese.

56:29.385 --> 56:32.138
- How did she get my number?
- I don't know.

56:32.222 --> 56:33.598
Hello, this is Gerald.

56:34.182 --> 56:36.518
- She knows about the book already.
- Yes, ma'am.

56:36.601 --> 56:39.521
What was your question
that you would have for me?

56:39.604 --> 56:41.439
Well, I guess I wanted to know
if you've read it yet

56:41.523 --> 56:42.482
and what you thought of it.

56:42.565 --> 56:45.110
Well, you know, it's...

56:46.027 --> 56:48.363
it's my life, you know, my secret life.

56:48.863 --> 56:51.116
Yeah, we are gonna have this
in the paper tomorrow

56:51.199 --> 56:52.700
and we'd like to get your thoughts.

56:52.784 --> 56:56.121
Well, I can't...
I wish I could give you more.

56:56.204 --> 56:58.206
- Why don't you wait a little bit?
- No, Gerald.

56:58.289 --> 57:01.835
Wait a little bit
until July when the book comes out.

57:01.918 --> 57:03.211
That's what I'd suggest.

57:03.294 --> 57:05.880
And then you call me
and I'll give you an interview.

57:05.964 --> 57:07.715
But you weren't filming any of this,
were you?

57:07.799 --> 57:11.386
Never, never.
That was before the electronic age.

57:12.053 --> 57:14.097
Gerald, that's enough.

57:16.433 --> 57:18.852
I can't tell you any more than that.

57:18.935 --> 57:23.064
I can't tell you any more than that,
because I'm still under contract.

57:23.648 --> 57:25.191
Get off the phone, Gerald.

57:25.275 --> 57:28.319
I'm not gonna answer any more questions
about it, not right now.

57:28.403 --> 57:29.988
Gerald, I have to go.

57:30.071 --> 57:32.240
And my wife has to go,

57:32.323 --> 57:34.451
and she's getting ready
to go do something and...

57:34.534 --> 57:35.660
Gerald.

57:36.453 --> 57:39.289
Okay, well, thank you very much. Goodbye.

57:39.873 --> 57:41.416
How did she get my number?

57:41.499 --> 57:44.419
I don't know, unless Gay gave it to her,
'cause she talked to Gay.

57:44.502 --> 57:46.337
There's gonna be an article
in the Denver Post,

57:46.421 --> 57:49.215
so that's gonna really loosen things up.

58:22.373 --> 58:25.335
I did talk to the reporter
from the Denver Post.

58:28.004 --> 58:29.881
I spoke to her, and there's an article.

58:29.964 --> 58:34.761
But there's nothing in that article
that hasn't been said in the New Yorker.

58:38.848 --> 58:40.600
I went to go get the paper
this morning,

58:41.267 --> 58:43.978
and I looked at it
and I thought, "Oh, shit."

58:44.854 --> 58:51.611
It says, "Ex-Colfax motel owner 'thinks
he's the greatest voyeur in the world.'"

58:52.153 --> 58:56.908
Right here. There's Gerald
in his office at the motel.

58:57.617 --> 59:02.372
It says, "Sex, lies,
but no video tapes for hotel owner."

59:03.039 --> 59:05.375
And then here's the book of Gay Talese.

59:06.834 --> 59:09.504
If my phone rings,
I'm just gonna let it go.

59:10.672 --> 59:13.633
I have a feeling
my brothers and sisters are gonna call,

59:13.716 --> 59:15.593
and I don't know what to say.

59:17.303 --> 59:21.933
Gerald told me to say,
"Hey, it's just a story. It's not real."

59:22.934 --> 59:25.853
Right? But it is real.

59:28.273 --> 59:30.567
I tell you, the shit has hit the fan.

59:30.650 --> 59:34.279
I just talked to a friend of mine
in Minnesota.

59:34.362 --> 59:36.614
It's all over the Twin Cities already.

59:36.698 --> 59:39.367
It's in every city in the country
right now.

59:41.411 --> 59:44.247
I'm not good.
I'm shaking like a fucking leaf.

59:58.845 --> 01:00:05.018
It's quiet now, but it's not gonna be
quiet very soon, I don't think.

01:00:07.812 --> 01:00:10.690
I gotta tell you guys something.
We've gotta get round the table.

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:12.358
I'm really pissed off.

01:00:13.192 --> 01:00:14.694
Really pissed off.

01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:19.157
And it's probably my fault, but...

01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:22.910
And I'm scared.

01:00:22.994 --> 01:00:24.537
I have a lot of fear...

01:00:25.371 --> 01:00:29.667
because I love that lady over there
and I'll do anything to protect her.

01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:34.172
But when Gay Talese...

01:00:37.592 --> 01:00:42.013
makes that last statement in there,
talking about my card collection.

01:00:42.096 --> 01:00:44.599
That... I never wanted that in there.

01:00:44.682 --> 01:00:48.728
I don't want people to know that I got
a million-dollar card collection here.

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:52.899
What if a lawyer turns around and sues me?

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:56.819
And they put a lock on the house
and everything in it?

01:00:56.903 --> 01:00:58.738
I can't even sell it,

01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:01.574
because the reason they put a lock on it
is they know it's worth millions,

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:05.578
and, therefore,
they can get the money, you see.

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:07.080
God, what the...

01:01:07.163 --> 01:01:09.707
I never saw any of those things.

01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:14.212
Never once did he ever show me
the damn manuscript.

01:01:14.295 --> 01:01:16.714
Never once did he show me the thing

01:01:16.798 --> 01:01:19.801
that was written
for the New Yorker magazine.

01:01:20.468 --> 01:01:24.847
And I would have been adamant.
"Get that out of there!"

01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:29.394
You don't put that stuff in there.
You don't write about a man's money.

01:01:29.477 --> 01:01:31.646
I mean, I'm really mad at Gay.

01:01:31.729 --> 01:01:35.692
I'm mad as hell at him,
because he should have consulted me.

01:01:35.775 --> 01:01:38.903
I'm the guy! Not him.

01:01:38.986 --> 01:01:43.449
He's made this thing pointed.
"Hey, I'm the big star here," you know.

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:44.784
"I'm the big star.

01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:48.329
"I've written all these books,
and here I am," you know.

01:01:48.413 --> 01:01:51.165
And then he writes bullshit about me.

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:55.753
That's the only thing
I'm really pissed off about in there,

01:01:55.837 --> 01:01:58.047
and I am seriously pissed off about it.

01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:01.551
And I think Gay and I are gonna have
a hell of a real bad problem.

01:02:03.928 --> 01:02:09.809
"He's still pondering Foos' true motive
in revealing his secrets."

01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:13.396
One reason could be money.

01:02:14.647 --> 01:02:17.275
Talese draws parallels...

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:20.486
to the Unabomber...

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:25.158
and Watergate's Deep Throat.

01:02:27.869 --> 01:02:31.497
Men who did not want to take secrets
to their graves.

01:02:32.457 --> 01:02:38.004
"Foos is hoping to come clean
30 years later and find redemption."

01:02:39.505 --> 01:02:41.174
That's true?

01:02:42.633 --> 01:02:47.680
Kinda, but you don't do it
with listing his assets.

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:51.267
- Gerald, excuse me.
- Yeah, I get it. I get it.

01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:53.436
It's not Gay's fault.
It's your fault, too.

01:02:53.519 --> 01:02:54.854
Everything is my fault.

01:02:55.646 --> 01:02:58.065
- Has he called you back?
- No.

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:02.945
What the hell does he think this is,
some kind of goddamn game?

01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:05.072
Gerald, it's different hours...

01:03:05.156 --> 01:03:07.950
Bullshit. It's ten o'clock in New York.

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:12.538
I tell ya, it's getting to be...

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:16.584
- Gerald, just calm down.
- I don't wanna get sideways with that man.

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:20.880
I just want to tell you that I love you,
and calm down, okay?

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:23.049
Okay, darling. Thank you.

01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:29.430
She is smart.

01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:44.862
- You see what I mean?
- He trusts you.

01:03:44.946 --> 01:03:47.907
I know, but he won't
if you say something to him.

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:50.618
I shouldn't have to say
anything. You should be talking to him...

01:03:50.701 --> 01:03:54.080
Keep your voice down, okay?
Don't come between us.

01:03:55.581 --> 01:03:57.124
Don't do that again.

01:03:58.376 --> 01:04:00.878
Gay, I'm sorry to bother you.
This is Gerald.

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:07.009
I just wanted to touch bases with you
about some of the stuff...

01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:11.055
I'd just like to talk to you
if I could, please.

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:14.684
If you have the opportunity, call me.
I appreciate it.

01:04:19.146 --> 01:04:21.899
Come on.
God, this goddamn laptop is terrible.

01:04:23.317 --> 01:04:29.782
"You called yourself a pioneer,
a truth-teller, a chance taker,"

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:32.243
a man to be compared,
maybe better than compared,

01:04:32.326 --> 01:04:35.079
to Alfred Kinsey and Masters and Johnson.

01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:38.958
These people,
though recognized with respect today,

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:42.295
were vilified when they first appeared
on the public scene,

01:04:42.378 --> 01:04:44.839
considered to be obscene and criminal.

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:48.384
So now the story of Gerald Foos
has gone public,

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:54.098
and Gerald Foos must, as a man of courage
and strength, stand tall and tough.

01:04:54.181 --> 01:04:55.391
You take it for a while

01:04:55.474 --> 01:04:58.352
because you want to reveal
the truth of who you are

01:04:58.436 --> 01:05:00.229
and why you know what you know.

01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:03.816
Okay, hang in there
as athletes and pioneers must.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:06.235
"Best, Gay Talese, your pal."

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:18.247
You're gonna meet
the bad guy now.

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:21.459
Is this in reference to
that book you wrote?

01:05:21.542 --> 01:05:22.877
- Didn't you write a book?
- Yes, sir.

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.295
I know who you are.

01:05:24.378 --> 01:05:25.463
Come on in.

01:05:25.546 --> 01:05:27.757
I got this call just a little bit ago.

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.550
A threatening phone call.

01:05:29.634 --> 01:05:32.887
I'm scared to death right now.
I don't even know what the hell to do.

01:05:32.970 --> 01:05:35.973
This guy was dead serious on that phone.

01:05:36.057 --> 01:05:38.100
The phone rang, and the guy says,

01:05:38.184 --> 01:05:41.312
"I'm gonna have my friends
come there and kill you,

01:05:41.395 --> 01:05:42.813
'cause you're threatening me."

01:05:42.897 --> 01:05:44.899
- No. See, I'm nervous, too.
- No, it's okay.

01:05:44.982 --> 01:05:47.610
But the guy says,
"I'm gonna threaten you guys."

01:05:47.693 --> 01:05:50.655
- He said...
- "I got friends." I didn't hear all of it.

01:05:50.738 --> 01:05:53.115
I remembered something
the guy said.

01:05:53.199 --> 01:05:57.870
He said, "Now you're the one
that's being watched."

01:05:58.579 --> 01:06:00.206
Thank you, guys.

01:06:02.416 --> 01:06:05.878
Son of a bitch. Damn, motherfuck.

01:06:08.005 --> 01:06:09.674
Son of a bitch.

01:06:11.342 --> 01:06:12.927
I don't know what to do now.

01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:15.179
I don't know whether
to start getting my guns out,

01:06:15.262 --> 01:06:16.722
and laying 'em out every place

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:19.725
where they're pointed
in certain directions or what.

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:23.396
- Don't be so nervous, Gerald.
- Oh, I don't know.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:27.149
Sometimes you get nervous
when you're ready to die.

01:06:28.734 --> 01:06:30.861
- Not really.
- I just said a bit ago

01:06:30.945 --> 01:06:33.948
that I thought I'd die
before this book came out.

01:06:35.116 --> 01:06:36.867
This is too much pressure on me.

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:43.791
All through my arms and my legs.
I feel this feeling of fear.

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:49.213
"10:00 a. m."

01:06:49.296 --> 01:06:53.300
Coming to get me and kill me
because I am no good pervert.

01:06:54.343 --> 01:06:56.721
Had my address and phone number.

01:06:56.804 --> 01:07:00.349
"I thought that I knew the voice
but didn't know for sure."

01:07:11.235 --> 01:07:13.320
You can't hide anymore, can you?

01:07:17.366 --> 01:07:19.118
Sometimes I think that...

01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:21.996
it's not real.

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:26.167
It's kind of a dream world.

01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:31.338
Last night, I had a dream
most of the night that I was being chased.

01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:35.176
I was being chased by people
who were trying to catch me.

01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:40.097
I was running
and hiding away from 'em, and...

01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:42.433
Just went on a long time.

01:07:49.273 --> 01:07:53.152
You know, if I knew what I was gonna feel

01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:56.322
a year or two years ago,
I'd have never done this.

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:02.870
So, I don't know if that's gonna change.

01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:16.716
I thought there would be controversy
when the New Yorker piece ran.

01:08:18.511 --> 01:08:23.557
Almost anybody who reads it
sees it as a really fascinating story.

01:08:25.559 --> 01:08:27.144
People are going to react negatively

01:08:27.228 --> 01:08:30.064
without thinking about the material
in any serious way.

01:08:30.648 --> 01:08:33.149
On the face of it,
the fact that he was a voyeur

01:08:33.234 --> 01:08:35.402
and built this thing
specifically to watch people,

01:08:35.486 --> 01:08:37.196
and did it for 30 years...

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:39.448
is off-putting.

01:08:39.532 --> 01:08:41.117
You could be disturbed by it.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:45.078
I think it would be a bit unusual
if you weren't disturbed by it.

01:08:45.162 --> 01:08:48.957
But I don't think that's necessarily bad
for sales of the book.

01:08:52.377 --> 01:08:55.965
The publisher has issued orders
to me not to talk to nobody.

01:08:57.716 --> 01:09:00.469
According to this, I can't be trusted.

01:09:01.845 --> 01:09:04.723
We are weeks away
from the publication of the book.

01:09:06.642 --> 01:09:08.853
Now he needs somebody to hold his hand.

01:09:09.937 --> 01:09:12.606
This is something
I'm gonna take upon myself.

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:20.531
This is my last chance to take control
of The Voyeur's Motel.

01:09:22.491 --> 01:09:25.870
We're not gonna have
a happy honeymoon in Denver, either.

01:09:25.953 --> 01:09:27.453
That's gonna be a drag.

01:09:29.206 --> 01:09:31.750
To have a man of his stature,

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:35.587
and from New York City,
you know, coming to see us...

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.464
We're just common people.

01:09:38.924 --> 01:09:41.635
He doesn't associate with common people.

01:09:42.928 --> 01:09:45.639
Gay says that every time
he comes to see us,

01:09:45.723 --> 01:09:48.767
he wants us to dress up,
not like what we're wearing now.

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:53.606
He's used to going out with people
that are all shammied up.

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:56.567
All his people are all...

01:09:57.151 --> 01:10:01.614
They're all presidents
and CEOs of companies.

01:10:03.741 --> 01:10:06.285
They're all famous people, most of 'em.

01:10:08.662 --> 01:10:11.624
You heard me criticize Gay
a couple of times.

01:10:11.707 --> 01:10:14.126
I just wished
he'd have shared with me more.

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:18.005
But I'm not gonna let it
destroy the relationship.

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:21.759
It's about the book.

01:10:22.259 --> 01:10:23.802
We gotta stick together.

01:10:24.637 --> 01:10:26.555
'Cause if we don't stick together...

01:10:27.389 --> 01:10:28.724
you have nothing.

01:10:28.807 --> 01:10:30.559
That looks nice.

01:10:35.814 --> 01:10:37.900
I want to see
who's coming out of the car first.

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:41.570
There's... there's old Gay.

01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:43.822
Oh, no, he bought something for us.

01:10:44.406 --> 01:10:46.951
- Oh, roses!
- Oh, my God.

01:10:48.744 --> 01:10:50.913
- Roses.
- He didn't have to.

01:10:50.996 --> 01:10:54.250
I know it,
but he wants to make things good.

01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:56.752
He knows we've been through
a lot of stress.

01:10:57.419 --> 01:11:00.297
Hi, Gay. How are you? Come on in.

01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:02.132
- Flowers for you.
- Thank you.

01:11:02.216 --> 01:11:04.760
- And look at this guy.
- How are you doing?

01:11:04.843 --> 01:11:07.930
Where'd you get a suntan, Jerry?
All right.

01:11:08.806 --> 01:11:11.809
Gerald, you are making history.

01:11:11.892 --> 01:11:17.398
The editor was a little bit worried
about how the readers are gonna react.

01:11:17.481 --> 01:11:21.485
On the contrary, they love it.
Said it's one of the greatest stories.

01:11:21.568 --> 01:11:22.736
Can't believe this story.

01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:26.115
That's what people say.
They can't make that up.

01:11:26.198 --> 01:11:27.283
Can't make it up.

01:11:29.785 --> 01:11:33.289
We sat and we read it,
you know, the entire story.

01:11:33.372 --> 01:11:35.207
And I mean, it was...

01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:38.794
Some good and bad in there.
Wasn't a valentine.

01:11:38.877 --> 01:11:42.965
Some of it was surprising,
but I thought it was okay.

01:11:43.048 --> 01:11:47.219
I might have been a little upset,

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:48.429
'cause I'd never seen

01:11:48.512 --> 01:11:51.473
- any of what you had written.
- I know.

01:11:51.557 --> 01:11:54.893
And I never saw the manuscript
at all from you.

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:56.812
You have a right to an opinion,

01:11:56.895 --> 01:11:59.315
now, or next month,
or five years from now.

01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:03.110
What you do not want to do
is ever admit falsely

01:12:03.193 --> 01:12:06.488
that we cooperated with one another,
I showed you what I wrote.

01:12:06.572 --> 01:12:09.700
I don't need to give you
a lecture on journalism.

01:12:09.783 --> 01:12:11.327
But we journalists,

01:12:11.410 --> 01:12:14.455
if we're really honest
and not hatchet job people,

01:12:14.538 --> 01:12:16.790
which many of them are,
but I'm not one of 'em.

01:12:16.874 --> 01:12:18.417
I write the best I can.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:21.045
And when it's out there,
and it's got my name on it, there it is.

01:12:21.128 --> 01:12:23.630
If you don't like it,
you can shoot the messenger,

01:12:23.714 --> 01:12:27.301
you can edit it or write bad reviews,
which they do, for sure.

01:12:27.384 --> 01:12:28.969
That's the way it goes.

01:12:29.053 --> 01:12:31.972
- What other questions do we have?
- We didn't get total clarity.

01:12:32.056 --> 01:12:36.643
The thing about your voyeur's journals,
that start in '66,

01:12:36.727 --> 01:12:40.981
the question is, what exactly happened?

01:12:41.065 --> 01:12:43.859
He explained that he'd made
the mistake of date.

01:12:43.942 --> 01:12:47.279
Instead of '69 or...
He already answered that.

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:49.698
- He answered that.
- Confusion.

01:12:49.782 --> 01:12:52.451
If you're going back
on the discrepancy of the dates,

01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:54.119
he's already answered that.

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:55.954
- How much more we have to do?
- We're almost there.

01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:57.539
Then let's get on,
'cause this is dragging.

01:12:57.623 --> 01:12:59.500
I have a simple question
for you, Gerald.

01:12:59.583 --> 01:13:00.793
- All right.
- Okay.

01:13:00.876 --> 01:13:04.755
Do you have any regrets
working on this book with Gay Talese?

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:07.299
The question is
a legitimate question.

01:13:07.383 --> 01:13:10.803
Essentially, Gerald,
if you had it to do all over again...

01:13:11.553 --> 01:13:14.056
Or maybe that's...
Ask the question yourself.

01:13:14.139 --> 01:13:16.308
- That's the question.
- Make sure it's your question,

01:13:16.392 --> 01:13:18.519
'cause I don't wanna change your question.

01:13:18.602 --> 01:13:21.980
I don't wanna prompt an answer from him.
Ask him the way you ask it.

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:24.566
Gerald, if you had it to do
all over again,

01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:26.860
would you still participate
with this book?

01:13:26.944 --> 01:13:30.614
Didn't you ask that same question
and it's already on tape?

01:13:30.697 --> 01:13:33.242
Wait a minute.
He had misgivings, didn't he?

01:13:33.325 --> 01:13:35.411
- He did.
- I want you to get him to say that.

01:13:35.494 --> 01:13:38.872
I don't want you now, because I'm here...
What you've done is wrong.

01:13:38.956 --> 01:13:41.250
You talked to him privately
and you got an answer.

01:13:41.333 --> 01:13:42.376
- Now with me here...
- No.

01:13:42.459 --> 01:13:45.254
I'm affecting his answer.
Don't you understand?

01:13:45.337 --> 01:13:47.172
Do you have any regrets
about this process?

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:50.467
This is a phony answer.
I think it's unfair to him.

01:13:50.551 --> 01:13:55.305
I want you to let him be critical of me.
What you guys are doing is sanitizing it.

01:13:55.389 --> 01:13:59.143
He doesn't have...
He has misgivings. Of course he does.

01:13:59.226 --> 01:14:01.311
Why shouldn't he be allowed
to have misgivings?

01:14:01.395 --> 01:14:03.939
- I told him... Wait a minute.
- If you want...

01:14:04.022 --> 01:14:06.942
"You know, Gay,
I thought you wouldn't use that.

01:14:07.025 --> 01:14:09.778
- "Gay, I wish you checked with me."
- I know.

01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:12.948
Why can't he be critical of me?
Why can't you let that be critical?

01:14:13.031 --> 01:14:15.367
- I think I've already said that.
- Say it!

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:18.745
I'd ask you not to put the murder
in the book.

01:14:18.829 --> 01:14:20.664
You did. You asked me...

01:14:20.747 --> 01:14:23.667
That is... I didn't...
I did what I wanted to do.

01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:26.086
I didn't do what you wanted.
I did what I wanted.

01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:28.338
- Go out and blab to the public.
- It was your right,

01:14:28.422 --> 01:14:29.631
'cause we had a contract.

01:14:29.715 --> 01:14:31.508
We both have a right.
You have a right to criticize me.

01:14:31.592 --> 01:14:33.302
And they don't have a right
to ask you the same question

01:14:33.385 --> 01:14:34.511
if you're gonna sanitize it.

01:14:34.595 --> 01:14:36.889
Let's make what you said...
I didn't hear it.

01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:39.808
But in my presence,
you're not gonna be as candid

01:14:39.892 --> 01:14:43.061
as you would be if I wasn't here.
And that's part of journalism.

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:46.148
Why would... How do you know
what they're thinking?

01:14:46.231 --> 01:14:47.900
What's wrong about this

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:52.362
is they already asked you that question
with me not there.

01:14:52.446 --> 01:14:55.657
Then, with me here, they're trying
to get you to answer differently,

01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:58.911
which could expose you as a hypocrite.
Don't you understand?

01:14:58.994 --> 01:15:01.497
- I understand.
- This is the way journalism works.

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:03.790
These guys are not even
credible journalists.

01:15:03.874 --> 01:15:06.585
They're cameramen, but they don't know...

01:15:06.668 --> 01:15:10.255
- So you think that because I had...
- They pulled a trick on you.

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:13.717
That I would say something to them
that I'd never say to you personally?

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:15.802
That is true.

01:15:15.886 --> 01:15:18.722
- I don't know if it is.
- I bet it's more true than not true.

01:15:18.805 --> 01:15:21.350
- That's the way people are.
- Our goal isn't to trip you up.

01:15:21.433 --> 01:15:25.437
No, but your goal is to get him to say
a different answer to the same question.

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:27.105
Did we hit a sore spot on you?

01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:29.650
I know there's a lot of trick questioning
in this game,

01:15:29.733 --> 01:15:31.485
'cause I know this game.

01:15:31.568 --> 01:15:34.363
I don't wanna be in your corner.
I don't wanna be your apologist.

01:15:34.446 --> 01:15:36.990
I don't wanna be your personal biographer,
'cause I'm not.

01:15:37.074 --> 01:15:39.785
I'm my own goddamn writer,
and you're your own person.

01:15:39.868 --> 01:15:43.038
Let's quit. Are we over this? Are we okay?

01:15:46.875 --> 01:15:49.253
That was a good question.

01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:53.549
Come here, I want to ask you a question.

01:15:54.508 --> 01:15:55.884
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:58.845
Come here. Let me give you a hug.

01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:01.473
Everybody around here are friends,

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:04.893
but someday, like Gay says, we're gonna be
around people that aren't our friends.

01:16:04.977 --> 01:16:07.271
That's right.
You've got to stay away from them.

01:16:07.354 --> 01:16:09.731
If you start talking
before that book comes out,

01:16:10.315 --> 01:16:12.901
they will use what you say
against the book,

01:16:12.985 --> 01:16:16.196
- because they wanna make it worse.
- They wanna demonize me?

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:18.782
They wanna exploit you
'cause you're a hot subject.

01:16:18.865 --> 01:16:20.784
You're new.
You've just been on the Internet.

01:16:20.867 --> 01:16:24.079
You've been on the goddamn New Yorker.
You're a hot subject.

01:16:24.162 --> 01:16:25.872
- I get it.
- Okay.

01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:28.792
You talk to the camera. I wanna sit here.

01:16:28.875 --> 01:16:30.836
And get a little fresh air?

01:16:30.919 --> 01:16:32.838
I could stay out here an hour.

01:16:35.507 --> 01:16:39.094
Yeah, its real private,
and that's what I like.

01:16:39.177 --> 01:16:41.221
I am used to private spaces.

01:16:41.305 --> 01:16:43.765
Places that nobody can see me
and I can see them.

01:16:43.849 --> 01:16:44.891
Great.

01:16:46.852 --> 01:16:50.939
I'm confident I did enough work.
I spent enough time.

01:16:51.023 --> 01:16:54.067
I spent more than 25 years

01:16:54.151 --> 01:16:58.238
waiting to take him out of his dark attic.

01:16:58.322 --> 01:17:01.408
But I waited and waited
and waited patiently,

01:17:01.491 --> 01:17:06.371
till I could bring his story and him
as a person into the public eye.

01:17:07.039 --> 01:17:07.998
It's a good story.

01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:12.002
And I'll keep in touch with him
until we're both dead.

01:17:14.588 --> 01:17:16.506
It's beautiful.

01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:17.841
Okay.

01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:24.514
Researchers like you to think
that they're professional at all times,

01:17:24.598 --> 01:17:26.683
and detached and in control,

01:17:26.767 --> 01:17:29.645
that it's all in the name of work,
but it isn't true.

01:17:31.938 --> 01:17:36.151
I think anyone who courts
this kind of precarious existence,

01:17:36.234 --> 01:17:39.821
or delves into something that's rather,
maybe pioneering...

01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:42.824
I like to think of what I did
as a pioneering work.

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:44.743
But you're risking at all times.

01:17:45.369 --> 01:17:47.037
How does it look?

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:49.122
It fits you well.

01:17:49.206 --> 01:17:50.916
I think it's perfect.

01:17:54.878 --> 01:17:58.006
I know there's a lot of points
in your book, but what's the point here?

01:17:58.090 --> 01:18:02.010
You've done this exhaustive research.
What's in it for us?

01:18:02.761 --> 01:18:05.847
Give us some free advice
after all this research.

01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:09.142
Re-identify myself as a reporter.
I'm not an advocate.

01:18:09.226 --> 01:18:11.770
I'm a reporter who went out in the field
and told you what America's like.

01:18:11.853 --> 01:18:13.105
People in the show don't like it.

01:18:13.188 --> 01:18:15.190
Some people recognize it as truthful.

01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:22.322
Everybody wants to write
the great American novel.

01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:24.616
Why the fuck the great American novel?

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:28.745
I want to do something that no one wants
to think is great, but I think is great.

01:18:34.668 --> 01:18:37.421
I don't agree with your methods,
and I thought for sure when I came here,

01:18:37.504 --> 01:18:39.631
I thought you were just a dirty old man.

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:43.427
But you're just a reporter
trying to put your point across.

01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:45.470
That's the nicest thing
you could say about me.

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:49.307
I never know
how my work is gonna be received.

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:51.017
I've had a lot of bad reviews.

01:18:55.731 --> 01:18:58.108
This voyeur is full of high dreams.

01:18:58.859 --> 01:19:01.361
He thinks he's gonna be the star,

01:19:02.112 --> 01:19:04.948
and it's gonna be read around the world.

01:19:06.158 --> 01:19:09.619
I don't know what's gonna happen.
He doesn't know what's gonna happen.

01:19:09.703 --> 01:19:10.954
We'll see.

01:19:20.213 --> 01:19:22.257
What the fuck are we doing here?

01:19:23.467 --> 01:19:24.509
How...

01:19:27.846 --> 01:19:31.183
I had nothing but bad news
in the last three days.

01:19:31.266 --> 01:19:33.435
The biggest mistake I made...

01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:38.690
was talking to a Washington Post reporter
today named...

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:41.443
- Paul Farhi.
- Paul Farhi.

01:19:43.695 --> 01:19:45.822
I'm so tired I can't remember my own name.

01:19:49.409 --> 01:19:54.498
I received this e-mail from Farhi.
He said, "I'd like to talk to you."

01:19:54.581 --> 01:19:56.750
There's some discrepancies
I'd like to discuss.

01:19:57.417 --> 01:20:03.089
I have information that invalidates
much of what you wrote,

01:20:03.173 --> 01:20:08.011
"and questions your reputation
as a reporter."

01:20:08.094 --> 01:20:09.095
Wow.

01:20:10.013 --> 01:20:13.517
In 1980,
the voyeur sold the motel to somebody,

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:16.895
- a friend of his, a man named...
- Earl.

01:20:16.978 --> 01:20:20.148
- Earl Ballard.
- Earl Ballard.

01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:22.317
A name I'd never heard of.

01:20:22.901 --> 01:20:27.489
How could I have quoted the voyeur
from his journal

01:20:27.572 --> 01:20:30.951
when for six years
he didn't even own the goddamn motel?

01:20:31.034 --> 01:20:36.706
And I'm speechless, infuriated,
frustrated, helpless.

01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:38.291
I'm unable to defend myself,

01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:44.756
because the Washington Post reporter
is presenting to me factual information

01:20:45.966 --> 01:20:49.219
verified by him
and a matter of public record.

01:20:49.302 --> 01:20:53.265
I felt... I'm down the tubes.
The book is down the tubes.

01:20:53.348 --> 01:20:59.521
So I said that my book is down the toilet.

01:21:11.575 --> 01:21:15.287
Now I have demoted the fucking book
into the toilet.

01:21:16.037 --> 01:21:17.372
That's the end of it.

01:21:17.455 --> 01:21:23.211
This story in the Washington Post
is all over the fucking world.

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.515
This is the end.

01:21:35.599 --> 01:21:37.601
This is the end of me.

01:21:41.605 --> 01:21:44.774
I was lied to. I was interviewing a liar.

01:21:44.858 --> 01:21:47.944
I never thought of Gerald as...

01:21:48.028 --> 01:21:52.449
I wasn't talking to Walter Cronkite, okay?
I'm talking to this crazy guy.

01:21:52.532 --> 01:21:55.619
I thought I knew a little bit,
but I didn't know him at all,

01:21:55.702 --> 01:22:00.498
because I was taken in
on a long ride here into oblivion

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:03.084
as far as my career and reputation goes.

01:22:04.377 --> 01:22:07.172
Pick that up
and say to call us back, please.

01:22:10.342 --> 01:22:14.804
I called up Gerald Foos.
I said, "What the hell is going on here?"

01:22:14.888 --> 01:22:18.308
I was fucking angry.
I had the book already published.

01:22:19.392 --> 01:22:23.813
I'm screaming at the voyeur,
"My reputation is shot."

01:22:24.606 --> 01:22:25.649
Yours is, too.

01:22:26.274 --> 01:22:30.362
Our fucking careers are over.
We are done, sweetheart.

01:22:30.445 --> 01:22:33.198
This is where I've been hoodwinked,

01:22:33.281 --> 01:22:36.701
or seduced by you in my quest
for an honest and good story.

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:37.786
It is a hell of a good story.

01:22:37.869 --> 01:22:40.538
But now I have to defend it
as not fiction.

01:22:40.622 --> 01:22:42.540
And I didn't think I was writing fiction.

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:45.502
"And you've made me
look like a fake artist."

01:22:48.922 --> 01:22:51.800
I thought
that Earl Ballard was dead.

01:22:52.676 --> 01:22:55.804
He never really amounted to much
in the story,

01:22:55.887 --> 01:22:58.306
so I thought I'd just leave it dead.

01:22:58.890 --> 01:23:02.602
But the reverse was true, so...

01:23:02.686 --> 01:23:05.563
Earl and I observed together.

01:23:06.439 --> 01:23:10.235
Purchase of the Manor House,
that was his whole motivation.

01:23:10.777 --> 01:23:14.698
My deal with him
was just a friend to another friend.

01:23:15.949 --> 01:23:18.243
Or a voyeur to a voyeur.

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:24.874
After I sold the motel to him,
he allowed me to come and go as I please.

01:23:24.958 --> 01:23:26.584
Almost every night.

01:23:27.752 --> 01:23:30.964
But now he don't want nobody to know
he was a voyeur.

01:23:32.465 --> 01:23:34.509
It's his word against mine.

01:23:35.301 --> 01:23:37.929
And so, the book...

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:41.725
Sounds like
God is tearing it apart.

01:23:44.436 --> 01:23:45.812
It's real dreary around here.

01:23:45.895 --> 01:23:49.566
It's all cloudy,
and it just feels about the way I feel.

01:23:51.234 --> 01:23:54.904
Somehow I wish that I could go
someplace and hide.

01:23:55.572 --> 01:24:00.160
Gay told me, he said, "You know,
you and I are gonna die as old men",

01:24:00.243 --> 01:24:02.620
and we're gonna be known as liars."

01:24:09.085 --> 01:24:12.881
I let everybody down. Gay especially.

01:24:12.964 --> 01:24:18.053
He's such a proud, upstanding man,
and I got in his life and I ruined it.

01:24:28.897 --> 01:24:32.317
It's too late. The damage is done.

01:24:33.401 --> 01:24:36.154
That killed it. That book is dead.

01:24:37.614 --> 01:24:39.365
That book is really dead.

01:24:48.792 --> 01:24:50.210
How many they got?

01:24:51.127 --> 01:24:53.713
Right there. One?

01:24:53.797 --> 01:24:56.549
- And they sold three?
- Three total.

01:24:57.383 --> 01:24:59.385
Oh, God. That just...

01:24:59.844 --> 01:25:01.805
That book is really hid there.

01:25:02.555 --> 01:25:03.807
Nobody's gonna see it.

01:25:07.352 --> 01:25:09.604
- Nobody's gonna see it.
- Let's see.

01:25:09.687 --> 01:25:11.898
I thought that
the metropolitan area of New York

01:25:11.981 --> 01:25:13.858
would sell five million copies.

01:25:14.818 --> 01:25:16.778
What reviews?

01:25:16.861 --> 01:25:19.948
- Do you want me to show you?
- I'd like to see a couple.

01:25:20.031 --> 01:25:23.743
This was in the New York Times.
This was in Vulture.

01:25:23.827 --> 01:25:26.037
"Controversial." I don't like that.

01:25:26.746 --> 01:25:27.872
Hmm.

01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:33.920
They're sayin' everything
I've written in here is a lie.

01:25:34.003 --> 01:25:35.755
They're sayin' Gay knows it.

01:25:36.714 --> 01:25:41.553
Who is this jerk, this Jack Shafer jerk?

01:25:41.636 --> 01:25:45.098
This is the worst hatchet job
I've ever seen in my life.

01:25:45.181 --> 01:25:46.724
Can I see that one, Anita?

01:25:48.852 --> 01:25:54.065
Well, if anything does it, this will
surely ought to fix it up really good.

01:25:54.816 --> 01:25:57.652
Nothing good in it, not one thing.

01:25:59.279 --> 01:26:03.783
I can see why he hasn't called me,
'cause he took all this stuff to heart.

01:26:03.867 --> 01:26:07.954
I've only gone through the first page
of this, and it's a nightmare.

01:26:09.706 --> 01:26:13.084
I say pull the book off the shelf
and forget.

01:26:17.547 --> 01:26:18.381
Here.

01:26:18.464 --> 01:26:21.634
We knew something was going on.
You didn't want to tell us.

01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:30.018
He's been criticized
'cause he didn't turn me in.

01:26:30.852 --> 01:26:32.395
That's what it says here.

01:26:32.478 --> 01:26:35.773
"Talese is as guilty as this guy."
"Coward."

01:26:36.774 --> 01:26:39.944
Talese said, "So I have again
to answer for myself."

01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:41.821
But the real problem is ahead."

01:26:45.450 --> 01:26:48.912
Looks like there's a definite split
between Gay and myself.

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:52.957
There's just no way it can ever be healed.

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:57.170
And I'll blame him and he'll blame me,
and that's just the way it is.

01:26:57.253 --> 01:27:00.298
And all this stuff here...

01:27:01.674 --> 01:27:04.427
I feel like destroying it right now.

01:27:06.346 --> 01:27:09.933
This is pointing direct fingers
at the voyeur

01:27:10.016 --> 01:27:11.935
as being nothing but a creep.

01:27:12.018 --> 01:27:14.562
- Well? You are.
- Huh?

01:27:15.438 --> 01:27:17.482
My God, Anita.

01:27:18.191 --> 01:27:19.192
Well...

01:27:20.026 --> 01:27:21.402
I guess I'll...

01:27:37.293 --> 01:27:40.255
- What you doing back here, Anita?
- Nothin'.

01:27:41.839 --> 01:27:43.258
- Gerald?
- What?

01:27:45.718 --> 01:27:46.970
Isn't that nice?

01:27:56.312 --> 01:27:57.939
You wanna blow?

01:27:58.022 --> 01:27:59.440
Make a wish first.

01:28:29.012 --> 01:28:31.431
Late Night with Seth Meyers.

01:28:32.473 --> 01:28:34.434
Tonight, Kristen Wiig.

01:28:35.643 --> 01:28:37.145
Keke Palmer.

01:28:37.228 --> 01:28:39.230
Author, Gay Talese.

01:28:39.314 --> 01:28:40.398
There he is.

01:28:40.481 --> 01:28:42.942
Featuring the 8G Band
with Thomas Lang.

01:28:43.026 --> 01:28:44.277
Welcome back.

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:45.611
Our next guest

01:28:45.695 --> 01:28:48.323
is one of the most influential journalists
of the 20th century.

01:28:48.406 --> 01:28:51.451
His latest book, The Voyeur's Motel,
is in stores now.

01:28:51.534 --> 01:28:54.620
Please welcome the very talented,
the legend, Gay Talese.

01:29:02.712 --> 01:29:04.589
I wanted to be a writer

01:29:04.672 --> 01:29:07.967
maybe not of the right people,
but the wrong people, the wrong side.

01:29:08.051 --> 01:29:11.429
In The Voyeur's Motel, you found someone
who is arguably on the wrong side.

01:29:11.512 --> 01:29:12.805
This is a man who reached out to you,

01:29:12.889 --> 01:29:15.767
said, "I think you might be interested
in writing about this."

01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:18.561
- Oh, he got the right guy.
- Yeah.

01:29:19.771 --> 01:29:20.813
Let me ask you about this.

01:29:20.897 --> 01:29:22.440
The Washington Post
did an interview with you,

01:29:22.523 --> 01:29:25.526
where they had found
some inconsistencies in his story

01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:27.945
as far as the years he owned the hotel.

01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:32.367
You even say in the book that you
can't vouch for everything he said.

01:29:32.450 --> 01:29:34.494
Do you think it's fair
for the Washington Post

01:29:34.577 --> 01:29:36.371
to call you out for getting facts wrong?

01:29:36.454 --> 01:29:40.833
It might be self-serving the way I sound,
but I'm not trying to be self-serving.

01:29:40.917 --> 01:29:42.418
The Washington Post was wrong.

01:29:42.502 --> 01:29:46.589
The Washington Post said that
during a period he didn't own the motel.

01:29:46.672 --> 01:29:49.383
And I didn't know that,
and I was very upset.

01:29:49.467 --> 01:29:52.095
I said, "I can't go along
and support this book."

01:29:52.178 --> 01:29:55.431
But the next day I called the guy
who bought the motel,

01:29:55.515 --> 01:29:58.851
and he said, "No, he still had
access to it. He had the key."

01:29:58.935 --> 01:30:03.064
If I had known that day I was told
what I know now,

01:30:03.147 --> 01:30:04.774
I wouldn't have disavowed the book.

01:30:04.857 --> 01:30:06.901
That was a mistake on my part.
I overreacted.

01:30:06.984 --> 01:30:09.403
I was very angry, and embarrassed, too,

01:30:09.487 --> 01:30:13.699
because I took pride in my life...
A reliable reporter, that's what I am.

01:30:21.207 --> 01:30:24.043
If Gay was here,
I'd say, "Hey, Gay, I'm sorry."

01:30:24.961 --> 01:30:29.507
And I know that some way and somehow,
we could have a meeting of the minds.

01:30:31.509 --> 01:30:36.222
We always had extreme trust
for each other,

01:30:36.305 --> 01:30:38.015
and I believe I let you down,

01:30:38.099 --> 01:30:42.353
"because I did not tell you the truth
about Earl Ballard."

01:30:44.772 --> 01:30:48.609
In the journals,
I talked about the voyeur.

01:30:49.777 --> 01:30:52.738
And it's empty and lonely.

01:30:54.866 --> 01:30:57.535
Because you have nobody
that you can talk to,

01:30:57.618 --> 01:30:59.495
or tell 'em how you're feeling.

01:31:01.873 --> 01:31:05.418
And somehow I feel that
when I talk to you guys,

01:31:05.501 --> 01:31:07.628
it's like somebody opened a drain...

01:31:09.172 --> 01:31:13.050
and I'm able to free myself
of those thoughts.

01:31:15.303 --> 01:31:16.679
And I love you guys.

01:31:16.762 --> 01:31:20.808
I don't know, I feel a feeling
of companionship with you guys

01:31:20.892 --> 01:31:23.728
that I don't feel with very many people.

01:31:27.815 --> 01:31:30.193
I'll tell you, I was very surprised...

01:31:31.152 --> 01:31:33.863
that you got the cooperation you did.

01:31:33.946 --> 01:31:39.493
I did not believe there was any way
we could get you down to film him.

01:31:42.914 --> 01:31:47.084
When I got permission
for you to come down...

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:55.009
the first day you arrived,
he started talking freely.

01:31:58.012 --> 01:32:02.266
I thought, "Does he know what he's doing?
Does he know what he's doing?"

01:32:07.813 --> 01:32:12.902
He opened up his home to you,
his bedroom to you, his wife to you.

01:32:15.238 --> 01:32:18.699
He liked the publicity of the camera.
The camera turned him on.

01:32:22.203 --> 01:32:24.080
And there it was.

01:32:25.081 --> 01:32:26.707
The reverse procedure.

01:32:31.295 --> 01:32:33.256
He's now being watched.

01:32:34.305 --> 01:32:40.891
