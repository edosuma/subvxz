-Stepson from my first marriage.

-Does this have GPS?
-[Cary] We all wear them.

[Joe] If Matthew has access
to Natalie's ring,

00:36.327 --> 00:38.872
he'll be able to see exactly where she is.

00:38.955 --> 00:42.542
I put the ring on the sink
so it looked like she washed her hands.

00:43.418 --> 00:46.629

Then again, Scout didn't help

01:23.833 --> 01:27.087
to cover up the murder
of the next-door neighbor's wife.

more attention.

02:00.245 --> 02:04.040
The 32-year-old realtor was last seen
leaving her home for work.

in cutting-edge surveillance,

02:19.973 --> 02:21.891

you can tell us about Natalie Engler

We just moved here

for socializing.

Of course they're not gonna act
like they're suspicious.

a reason to be suspicious. What?

It's probably best
if no one goes down for this, right?

05:00.717 --> 05:05.972

people will eventually assume she ran off.

12:37.214 --> 12:38.716
Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.469
Then why is there security footage

12:41.552 --> 12:44.472
of you two chatting
in a grocery store parking lot

12:44.555 --> 12:46.182
two days before she vanished?

12:46.891 --> 12:49.769
[Joe] Sweating? I need to get it together.

12:51.896 --> 12:55.232
Coincidence. I like to say hi
when I run into a neighbor.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.234
How do you explain...

12:58.778 --> 13:00.279
this exchange?

13:00.362 --> 13:03.157
[Joe] Does every inch of Madre Linda
have a camera?

13:03.949 --> 13:06.786
Do you typically receive prophylactics
from your neighbors

13:06.869 --> 13:08.913
when you just stop to say hi?

13:09.830 --> 13:12.458
[Joe] They don't suspect me.
They are just doing their job.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.168
I need to stop sweating.

13:14.251 --> 13:15.753
[cell phone buzzing]

13:16.837 --> 13:21.091
-You can deal with that if you need to.
-[Joe] So they can observe my behavior.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.760
No, it's fine. It's okay.

13:23.677 --> 13:24.845
Condoms...

13:25.429 --> 13:28.307
The thing is,
Natalie has a weird sense of humor,

13:28.390 --> 13:30.017
and she gave these to me as a joke.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.852
I still don't know what she meant.

13:32.436 --> 13:34.522
What do they want? A confession?

13:36.524 --> 13:38.859
Wait. That's not a terrible idea.

13:40.861 --> 13:45.950
I wasn't going to say this.
But I think I need to come clean.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.410
I live with a newborn...

13:49.787 --> 13:53.040
and a very stressed wife.

13:56.252 --> 13:57.419
There's nowhere...

13:58.546 --> 14:02.174
for a man to enjoy himself,
if you understand what I'm saying.

14:03.259 --> 14:07.137
Add in a mother-in-law who stops
by unannounced frequently--

14:07.221 --> 14:09.932
We strongly advise you

14:10.015 --> 14:13.185
to not do that anymore.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.522
I will try to contain myself.

14:18.732 --> 14:21.861
Masturbation saves the day for now.

14:27.491 --> 14:30.536
-We're at A Fresh Tart and look at this.
-[bells chiming]

14:30.619 --> 14:34.999
We got Madre Linda's
newest baking queen, Love Quinn.

14:35.082 --> 14:37.626
-Are you--?
-I'm making an ironic TikTok.

14:37.710 --> 14:38.711
Delete it!

14:39.628 --> 14:40.546
Okay.

14:41.630 --> 14:43.340
-Sorry.
-Thank you.

14:43.424 --> 14:47.052
-Yep. It's deleted.
-I'm just having a bad hair day.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.554
Looks pretty good to me.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.348
Stop that.

14:51.432 --> 14:52.600
Stop what?

14:52.683 --> 14:53.767
Flirting.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.687
Yeah, okay. Yes. Yes.

14:56.770 --> 14:59.607
-Yes, you are right. You are married.
-Thank you.

15:00.649 --> 15:03.527
Now, what can I get you?

15:04.445 --> 15:08.073
Okay, so my house
is swarming with reporters.

15:08.157 --> 15:11.702
So I had to jump my fence
just to go get some lunch,

15:11.785 --> 15:15.956
which is also the story
of why I forgot my wallet.

15:16.040 --> 15:16.874
Ah.

15:16.957 --> 15:21.503
And now I am gonna die
starving and destitute.

15:22.212 --> 15:23.631
Unless...

15:25.174 --> 15:26.300
you were to...

15:28.510 --> 15:30.888
My issue is that you're still flirting
and I asked you not to.

15:30.971 --> 15:35.309
I'm not flirting with you.
I'm begging you for food.

15:37.853 --> 15:40.189
Okay. Jesus fucking Christ.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.900
Thank you, my lady and savior.

15:43.525 --> 15:44.401
Okay.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.905
-Carrot or chai walnut?
-Carrot, please.

15:56.914 --> 15:59.959
Fuck, did I just fail
a secret personality test or something?

16:00.042 --> 16:02.670
Oh, no, I, um...

16:04.296 --> 16:05.923
That was my first recipe.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.885
And I used to make it all the time
for my brother when he would...

16:12.221 --> 16:13.430
When he came around.

16:16.266 --> 16:17.267
Well, let's see.

16:25.025 --> 16:26.652
Are you fucking kidding me?

16:27.736 --> 16:28.737
What the fuck?

16:33.951 --> 16:36.078
Must be hard with Natalie missing.

16:37.287 --> 16:39.123
You know, I love a media zoo.

16:39.206 --> 16:42.626
How are you holding up?
Do you have people you can talk to?

16:46.422 --> 16:49.717
-[cell phone ringing]
-I wasn't trying to pry. I'm, um--

16:50.634 --> 16:53.012
Mom? I'm sorry. I can't--

16:54.847 --> 16:56.056
Wait, slow down.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.268
Oh, my God. Um...

17:00.686 --> 17:03.022
Okay. Yes. I'm on my way. Mm-hm.

17:03.689 --> 17:06.859
-Is everything okay? What's going on?
-My baby is sick.

17:06.942 --> 17:08.527
-Oh.
-I need to go.

17:09.319 --> 17:12.906
I need to close the bakery
and turn off the ovens.

17:12.990 --> 17:16.827
No, I know. You know what?
I got it. I got it. I can do it.

17:16.910 --> 17:20.789
I know how ovens work. It'll be fine.
Go be with your baby. Go.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.750
-Be with your baby.
-Yeah.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.836
-There's a spare key in the drawer.
-Okay, in the drawer.

17:25.919 --> 17:26.754
Yeah.

17:27.671 --> 17:28.672
[bells chiming]

17:31.508 --> 17:34.053
[Joe] What if the detectives
weren't just fishing?

17:34.136 --> 17:36.221
What if they know more
than they were saying?

17:36.305 --> 17:39.725
But no one knew about Natalie and me
except Love, at least, I think.

17:39.808 --> 17:40.642
Unless--

17:43.645 --> 17:44.605
There.

17:46.648 --> 17:49.401
[Joe]
Matthew. What if there were more cameras?

17:49.485 --> 17:51.487
What if she lied to me,
her boring neighbor?

17:51.570 --> 17:54.198
What if Matthew's building a case
against me?

17:54.281 --> 17:55.324
-Shit.
-[cell phone buzzing]

17:55.407 --> 17:57.159
I never called you back. I must be calm.

17:57.242 --> 17:59.745
You're a steady, stalwart Atticus Finch.

17:59.828 --> 18:03.248
-I'm sorry, they had more questions.
-[Love] I'm at the hospital.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.292
Henry has the measles.

18:09.922 --> 18:13.926
[Joe] I've been kidnapped,
held at knifepoint, held at gunpoint,

18:14.009 --> 18:16.470
lost a finger, been locked in a cage,

18:16.553 --> 18:18.639
but in my history of scared,

18:19.306 --> 18:20.140
this...

18:21.433 --> 18:23.435
is the most scared I've ever been.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.771
That nurse has been gone
an awfully long time.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.940
It's a quick test. He'll be right back.

18:28.607 --> 18:31.527
I looked at his blood work
and he was infected about a week ago.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.279
How? I thought
the measles were eradicated.

18:34.363 --> 18:35.280
Even with COVID,

18:35.364 --> 18:37.908
there are parents
who don't have their kids vaccinated.

18:37.991 --> 18:41.495
You need to contact anyone
who's been near Henry right away.

18:42.287 --> 18:43.997
You've all had your immunizations?

18:44.081 --> 18:45.040
-Yes.
-Yeah.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.750
I'm sure I did.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.002
[Joe] Oh, really, Ms. Peace,
Love and Yoni Eggs?

18:49.086 --> 18:53.841
-Are you sure you had Love vaccinated?
-What does--? Yes, don't be ridiculous.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.092
What are the symptoms?

18:55.175 --> 18:59.096
-Fever?
-Cough, runny nose, general discomfort.

19:00.430 --> 19:04.977
Now, in severe cases,
hearing loss, possible seizures.

19:05.435 --> 19:08.397
[Joe] Correction.
This is the most scared I've ever been.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.943
Is there medicine?

19:13.026 --> 19:16.280
For the fever.
Otherwise, it has to run its course.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.824
We'll keep him a few more hours
for observation.

19:18.907 --> 19:19.741
Okay.

19:20.534 --> 19:21.368
Thank you.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.332
Hi, Margaret, it's Love.

19:27.416 --> 19:30.919
Sorry to be delivering this news,
but Henry has the measles.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.671
I'm calling from the hospital.

19:32.754 --> 19:34.214
Thought I should let you know

19:34.298 --> 19:36.758
since we were all
at Hudson's birthday party last week.

19:36.842 --> 19:39.303
-Oh, my God.
-I'm so sorry.

19:39.386 --> 19:40.512
Oh, my God.

19:41.221 --> 19:43.140
-[cell phone beeping]
-Um--

19:43.223 --> 19:46.476
-I'm getting a call. Do you mind?
-I have to go.

19:50.355 --> 19:53.192
-Hi, Sherry. I was about to call.
-[Sherry] I just heard.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.651
Poor little guy!

19:54.735 --> 19:57.154
But you do not need to feel embarrassed.

19:57.237 --> 19:58.322
Embarrassed?

19:58.405 --> 20:01.658
Why don't I handle the calls
so you can focus on Henry?

20:02.701 --> 20:06.246
Um, that's very kind,
but it's important that I do it myself.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.498
Love? Love?

20:10.167 --> 20:12.127
Ooh.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.338
Did you hear about Love's baby?

20:14.421 --> 20:16.215
-What happened?
-What happened?

20:16.298 --> 20:18.300
My heart is breaking for them.

20:22.304 --> 20:26.516
Yes, I have to run, Mustafa.
Can we finish this afternoon?

20:27.100 --> 20:28.518
Good. Ciao.

20:29.394 --> 20:33.190
How were those calls?
I hope your friends weren't too upset.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.025
Why were you on the phone?

20:36.485 --> 20:38.570
If something's wrong, you need to tell me.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.530
I'm buying a vineyard.

20:41.448 --> 20:44.076
-You're doing what?
-Buying a vineyard, Love.

20:44.159 --> 20:47.996
So the money that was in flux
is no longer there.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.832
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.876
Your bakery will be fine.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.211
You'll figure it out.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.296
You're amazing.

20:56.380 --> 20:59.925
-Now don't get upset.
-I'm not upset. This is enlightening.

21:00.008 --> 21:01.927
I keep asking myself, wondering:

21:02.010 --> 21:04.137
"Why do I keep trying
to win Sherry's approval

21:04.221 --> 21:08.725
when she keeps stabbing me in the back
like a fucking stealth cunt?"

21:08.809 --> 21:11.937
It's obvious.
I'm recreating my relationship with you.

21:12.020 --> 21:14.564
You're under a lot of stress.
I know you don't mean--

21:14.648 --> 21:16.191
God. I want you to leave.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.819
I came here for a fresh start,
and you followed me here

21:18.902 --> 21:20.862
and brought
all your toxic garbage with you.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.447
You have so much anger.

21:23.073 --> 21:24.700
It's not healthy.

21:34.501 --> 21:36.962
[Joe] Is this retribution for my sins?

21:38.422 --> 21:39.840
[whispering] You have to get better.

21:40.882 --> 21:42.175
[monitor beeping]

21:43.051 --> 21:45.304
I haven't always been the best person.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.140
But being your dad...

21:50.267 --> 21:52.644
is changing me.

21:54.896 --> 21:56.148
You get better.

21:57.232 --> 22:00.777
Just get better. I promise
to be a man worthy of raising you.

22:04.114 --> 22:08.076
[reporter] Ryan Goodwin with the latest
in the Natalie Engler investigation.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.620
Friends close to Natalie Engler say
she went missing

22:10.704 --> 22:13.665
shortly after submitting
the lease for this bakery,

22:13.749 --> 22:16.793
owned by local resident
Love Quinn-Goldberg.

22:16.877 --> 22:19.546
Could this be the last place
Natalie was seen?

22:23.800 --> 22:24.968
Joe?

22:26.553 --> 22:28.805
[Joe] As if things weren't fucked enough.

22:30.432 --> 22:34.853
So cops are asking you questions,
and my name and business are on the news.

22:34.936 --> 22:37.356
Acting normal isn't working.
We need to do something.

22:37.898 --> 22:40.650
You're right.
You're right. Matthew's a threat.

22:40.734 --> 22:45.197
But everybody already thinks
that he did something to her.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.281
You're saying--?

22:46.365 --> 22:48.950
Frame him. Trying to think
of a word not from a movie.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.285
It's fine. I'm in.

22:52.454 --> 22:53.288
How?

22:57.209 --> 22:59.961
I do still have one thing from the box.

23:01.963 --> 23:05.884
Natalie's scarf with her blood on it.
I only kept it for insurance.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.220
Take care of it.

23:18.897 --> 23:20.941
[Joe] Whoa. Oof.

23:21.024 --> 23:21.858
Okay.

23:26.488 --> 23:31.201
What? How? No. But it can't be.

23:31.284 --> 23:33.286
I thought I was sweating
because I'm guilty.

23:33.995 --> 23:37.707
The measles, for fuck's sake!
What else can go wrong?

23:39.418 --> 23:41.628
That-- That came on fast.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.798
I've gotta get to Matthew's house
to plant the scarf.

23:44.881 --> 23:48.802
Uh. I'm burning up.
Room is spinning. Everything--

23:48.885 --> 23:51.054
I've got to do this. All over a scarf.

23:51.138 --> 23:52.848
Focus, focus.

23:52.931 --> 23:55.016
I should lie down.

23:55.517 --> 23:56.726
You sure about that?

24:00.480 --> 24:01.731
[Joe] This can't be good.

24:01.815 --> 24:03.900
Weren't you in the middle of something?

24:05.819 --> 24:09.156
Like saving your family?

24:09.239 --> 24:10.073
Yes.

24:12.242 --> 24:13.743
Yes, my family.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.374
I have to plant
Natalie's scarf at Matthew's.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.835
You could hop the fence in the backyard.

24:21.918 --> 24:23.753
No. No, he has cameras.

24:23.837 --> 24:27.591
The one outside is broken.
If you're worried, pop a hoodie on.

24:27.674 --> 24:29.926
You'll look just like
Matthew's douchebag kid.

24:37.100 --> 24:38.727
Sealed and everything.

24:38.810 --> 24:41.229
It's almost like you anticipated
needing it all along.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.440
-Shut up.
-You shut up.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.359
Where are you going?

24:47.652 --> 24:50.322
Where you should be going.
Boo Radley's house.

24:50.405 --> 24:51.823
[dramatic music playing]

25:12.177 --> 25:13.345
[indistinct chatter]

25:22.854 --> 25:23.855
Okay.

25:23.939 --> 25:26.149
One foot in front of the other.

25:30.987 --> 25:32.322
[Henry crying]

25:33.823 --> 25:35.116
[Love crying]

25:38.703 --> 25:39.955
Where is he?

25:41.998 --> 25:43.250
Where's Henry?

25:43.333 --> 25:45.710
Did you get vaccinated, Joe?

25:45.794 --> 25:46.795
[EKG flatlining]

25:49.631 --> 25:53.468
He's not moving! Somebody get a doctor!
Somebody help me!

25:55.637 --> 25:56.805
[Fiona] Joe?

25:59.140 --> 26:00.642
Are you not feeling well?

26:04.229 --> 26:06.815
I'm Nurse Fiona.
I'm going to check you out.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.901
Come in. Sit down.

26:24.916 --> 26:25.750
Open up.

26:28.670 --> 26:30.797
So you think you have a fever, huh?

26:31.756 --> 26:34.759
-If the boys are being mean to you--
-I can take care of myself.

26:34.843 --> 26:35.677
I know.

26:37.178 --> 26:39.139
You can stay here as long as you like.

26:41.891 --> 26:42.809
[gasps]

26:45.854 --> 26:47.147
You're gonna be fine.

26:53.361 --> 26:58.575
You know, I noticed that we don't have
any record of your vaccinations.

26:58.658 --> 27:02.579
-Did your mom ever take you to get a shot?
-Yeah, of course.

27:02.662 --> 27:07.000
I think maybe in the move,
we lost a record or something, but...

27:09.461 --> 27:10.503
she did it.

27:10.587 --> 27:11.421
She was good.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.924
[other Joe]
No. No, you shouldn't have said that.

27:15.008 --> 27:19.095
If you hadn't lied, you wouldn't be sick.

27:19.179 --> 27:22.307
Tell the nurse. She was a terrible mother.

27:22.390 --> 27:24.809
-Stop it.
-She was selfish and crazy.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.311
-Stop.
-Didn't take care of you.

27:26.394 --> 27:27.812
Go away. Go away!

27:27.896 --> 27:30.273
-Where are you going?
-It's too late now!

27:32.609 --> 27:34.069
[dramatic music playing]

27:40.283 --> 27:43.078
Hey! Look at me! Hey!
Look at me! Look at me!

27:43.161 --> 27:44.829
Calm down.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.373
Calm down.

27:50.085 --> 27:52.045
[Joe] I think this is real.

27:52.712 --> 27:54.798
What were you doing in my backyard?

27:55.298 --> 27:56.633
[Joe] Fuck.

27:56.716 --> 27:58.718
Fuck. Fuck!

28:06.101 --> 28:06.935
[Theo] Love.

28:07.894 --> 28:09.062
-Hey.
-Hi.

28:09.896 --> 28:13.400
Um, here.
I thought I would bring you dinner.

28:13.483 --> 28:14.734
It's tacos.

28:15.402 --> 28:17.112
Very thoughtful of you.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.782
So how is your son doing?

28:21.533 --> 28:23.743
-He's okay.
-Yeah? That's good.

28:24.369 --> 28:25.412
He's, uh...

28:29.332 --> 28:30.792
He's not okay.

28:30.875 --> 28:33.712
Some fucking brain-dead anti-vaxxer
got him sick,

28:33.795 --> 28:36.506
and it's probably getting
other people infected

28:36.589 --> 28:40.885
with some horrible life-threatening virus
that shouldn't even be a thing anymore.

28:40.969 --> 28:42.303
Hey, hey, hey.

28:44.389 --> 28:45.390
It's okay.

28:47.559 --> 28:49.728
-I'm sorry.
-Hey. Mm-mm.

28:50.311 --> 28:51.980
You don't have to apologize.

28:52.814 --> 28:54.607
Oh. I locked up the store.

28:54.691 --> 28:57.777
It was a really nice distraction
from being at home.

28:57.861 --> 29:00.321
Until the news crew arrived.

29:00.405 --> 29:01.406
Mm.

29:02.407 --> 29:04.784
Uh, when are you going back to school?

29:04.868 --> 29:07.370
Uh, I don't know. I feel like...

29:07.454 --> 29:10.790
we should probably wait
until we know about Natalie.

29:10.874 --> 29:16.463
So if you need some cheap-to-free labor
at the bakery,

29:17.088 --> 29:18.423
I'm your guy.

29:18.506 --> 29:20.425
Yeah, come in whenever you want.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.011
I could use the help.

29:24.512 --> 29:25.346
Okay.

29:26.556 --> 29:28.099
That would be great. Yeah.

29:28.183 --> 29:30.852
Especially if it gets me away
from my dad. Even better.

29:32.061 --> 29:34.147
He's really that hard to live with?

29:35.023 --> 29:35.982
Yeah.

29:36.065 --> 29:38.443
He's just never really been
a communicator,

29:38.526 --> 29:40.779
but, you know, his wife's missing.

29:40.862 --> 29:42.280
So if there was a time

29:42.363 --> 29:45.742
to start expressing
some form of emotion, it's now.

29:45.825 --> 29:49.370
But he's not.
He's, like, totally closed off.

29:49.454 --> 29:51.748
I don't know.
I just feel like it's gonna make him,

29:51.831 --> 29:54.125
like, even that more unreachable.

29:58.713 --> 29:59.839
You okay?

30:00.715 --> 30:02.217
-[Katzir] Ms. Quinn-Goldberg?
-Yes.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.719
-A moment?
-Yes. Thank you.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.930
-Thank you.
-[stammers] Yeah, of course.

30:15.605 --> 30:17.732
[Joe] How did I end up here?

30:17.816 --> 30:22.278
Oh, I was coming here to hide the scarf.
Did he catch me trying to hide it?

30:22.362 --> 30:23.363
I'm sick.

30:24.364 --> 30:26.324
I was having a fever dream.

30:27.408 --> 30:30.453
I must have hopped your fence.

30:31.704 --> 30:32.747
[coughing]

30:35.124 --> 30:36.376
I've got the measles.

30:36.459 --> 30:38.753
-So you really--
-I've been immunized.

30:39.629 --> 30:40.964
Surprised you weren't.

30:41.047 --> 30:43.299
[Joe] It's like he's waiting for me
to give myself away.

30:43.383 --> 30:46.177
What would
a normal neighbor say right now?

30:46.261 --> 30:48.179
Yeah, me too. I should've known.

30:48.263 --> 30:52.475
I have a few gaps in my childhood.

30:56.563 --> 30:58.147
I'm sorry about your wife.

30:59.065 --> 31:03.528
I considered coming over,
but I didn't wanna bother you.

31:05.238 --> 31:07.574
There's that look again.

31:07.657 --> 31:09.450
Does he know I kissed Natalie?

31:09.534 --> 31:11.828
Is he the reason the police are up my ass?

31:11.911 --> 31:15.498
-Natalie said you were becoming friends.
-[Joe] Shit.

31:15.582 --> 31:17.625
-You had a glass of wine.
-[Joe] Game over.

31:17.709 --> 31:21.296
Did she say anything to you
about going to visit her sister?

31:21.379 --> 31:23.590
[Joe] Or he doesn't know anything.

31:23.673 --> 31:26.259
He's just hoping
I can help him find his missing wife.

31:26.342 --> 31:27.510
I'm sorry.

31:28.136 --> 31:30.054
She didn't mention it.

31:31.431 --> 31:33.474
-[coughing]
-You should rest.

31:33.558 --> 31:36.311
I gave you some Tylenol
to help bring down the fever.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.355
[Joe] Is it possible Matthew's a nice guy?

31:39.439 --> 31:40.273
Thank you.

31:43.568 --> 31:44.611
Sure.

31:51.409 --> 31:55.121
-There's no updates on my son.
-What's wrong with your son?

31:55.747 --> 31:57.248
He's sick too.

31:57.332 --> 31:58.958
He's in the hospital.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.754
What if he doesn't get better?

32:03.755 --> 32:07.759
What if they get punished for our sins?

32:12.013 --> 32:13.014
I think...

32:14.057 --> 32:16.225
it's not punishment, it's...

32:16.809 --> 32:20.563
They reflect our sins back at us
so clearly, it's blinding.

32:22.148 --> 32:24.734
I never saw myself becoming a father.

32:25.318 --> 32:28.696
Then I met Theo's mom.
People become dads all kinds of ways.

32:28.780 --> 32:31.574
I was even kind of excited about it,
and Theo was a great kid.

32:31.658 --> 32:35.828
But I was young and extremely ambitious.

32:37.580 --> 32:40.333
I was a shitty stepdad
and he hated me for it.

32:43.878 --> 32:47.006
But now his mom's remarried, new family,
and Theo hates her even more.

32:47.090 --> 32:49.050
He's come back here almost by default.

32:49.717 --> 32:52.136
Most of the time,
I still have no idea what I'm doing.

32:52.845 --> 32:54.931
All I know is that he needs me.

32:56.182 --> 32:59.936
He needs me on some primal level,
just like your son needs you.

33:07.026 --> 33:10.071
Are you sure Natalie didn't say anything
to you about taking a trip?

33:10.863 --> 33:11.823
I'm sure she's fine.

33:11.906 --> 33:15.326
She's done this for attention,
and she's too embarrassed to come home.

33:16.536 --> 33:19.080
You don't think
anything's happened to her, do you?

33:19.163 --> 33:21.791
[Joe] What have we done, Love?

33:21.874 --> 33:24.794
I wanna help, but safest thing

33:24.877 --> 33:29.048
is to let him stay silent and hang himself
in the court of public opinion.

33:29.132 --> 33:30.800
[cell phone buzzing]

33:35.513 --> 33:36.514
He's okay.

33:38.099 --> 33:40.727
-He's gonna be okay.
-That's good.

33:40.810 --> 33:42.270
[Joe] Henry's okay.

33:43.688 --> 33:45.940
And I promised him
I'd be a good man, worthy.

33:46.024 --> 33:49.027
I cannot frame an innocent man.
I can't do it.

33:50.486 --> 33:52.280
I'd be killing a mockingbird.

33:54.157 --> 33:57.452
I know that you love Natalie,
but you're not talking to the press.

33:57.535 --> 34:00.246
-I don't care about the press.
-You should.

34:00.329 --> 34:03.166
If you don't tell your story,
they will tell it for you.

34:03.249 --> 34:06.085
You can't be there for Theo
if you're behind bars.

34:13.843 --> 34:14.844
[door closes]

34:18.890 --> 34:19.724
Hey.

34:19.807 --> 34:21.059
Oh, hey.

34:21.142 --> 34:26.064
Oh, no, no.
I didn't realize you were sick too.

34:26.147 --> 34:29.609
-You poor thing.
-It's okay. It's okay. I'm recovering.

34:29.692 --> 34:32.987
-How is he?
-He misses his daddy.

34:35.740 --> 34:39.577
Don't ever scare us like that again,
Mr. Dramatic.

34:41.370 --> 34:42.789
I love you too much.

34:46.125 --> 34:47.460
Did you do it?

34:48.377 --> 34:51.547
[Joe] What you're really asking is
what kind of father I am.

34:51.631 --> 34:53.716
Wish you could go through the front.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.802
-Reporters, I get it.
-Yeah.

34:55.885 --> 34:58.971
-You sure I can't help you home?
-I'm okay. I'm okay.

34:59.055 --> 35:01.099
My wife and kid are coming back.

35:01.182 --> 35:04.644
-You've done more than enough.
-Okay. Get home safe.

35:05.353 --> 35:07.730
Don't wanna find you passed out
by the trash again.

35:10.608 --> 35:11.609
Mm.

35:14.612 --> 35:16.155
[ominous music playing]

35:29.377 --> 35:30.294
I did it.

35:31.629 --> 35:32.797
But then...

35:35.508 --> 35:36.801
I took it back.

35:37.510 --> 35:39.178
Matthew's a decent man.

35:39.262 --> 35:42.682
He already lost his wife.
If we send him to prison--

35:42.765 --> 35:44.517
What kind of people would we be?

35:44.600 --> 35:45.685
[Joe] Wow.

35:46.477 --> 35:47.562
You get it.

35:48.563 --> 35:49.939
We're better than that.

35:50.523 --> 35:52.567
["I Lied" playing]

35:52.650 --> 35:53.568
We are.

35:58.990 --> 36:02.285
What does it mean to be a good father?

36:02.368 --> 36:03.494
To protect, yes.

36:03.578 --> 36:05.830
But can you be a good father

36:05.913 --> 36:07.582
if you're a bad man?

36:08.166 --> 36:11.544
It's not the kind of father I wanna be
and the kind of mother you wanna be.

Is he gonna come out? I don't get it.

Is this some kind of strategy?

37:09.018 --> 37:11.229
[Joe] Sherry and Kiki
held out the longest,

37:11.312 --> 37:14.273
but that's so they could grab
the best flowers for a photo shoot.

to look even guiltier,

-Matthew, sir.

He's out. Come on. Let's go. Camera up.

quick questions, Matthew?

37:36.045 --> 37:37.505
[ominous music playing]

37:41.884 --> 37:45.304
It would mean a lot to Natalie to see
how many people came out here.

37:46.639 --> 37:47.890
How many people care.

37:51.477 --> 37:53.479
[Joe] It wasn't a strategy.

37:53.562 --> 37:58.192
He waited so long
because he almost couldn't do it.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.278
It's that hard for him to talk about her.

38:00.945 --> 38:02.738
Because he cares.

38:02.822 --> 38:06.909
I am worried about my wife.
Natalie, if you're watching this,

38:07.743 --> 38:08.744
please come home.

38:09.745 --> 38:11.372
Or let me know you're okay.

to go down for this.

We need you.

has done something to my wife...

[Joe] It's been said,
"Nothing ever happens in the suburbs."

39:29.575 --> 39:31.077
[doorbell rings]

39:33.746 --> 39:35.122
-Hey.
-Hey.

39:36.499 --> 39:40.878
It's an inadequate gesture
for making sure I didn't die last week.

39:40.961 --> 39:44.048
Unnecessary. Thank you.
I'm glad you're better.

39:45.257 --> 39:47.802
If you'll excuse me, I'm expecting a call.

39:52.139 --> 39:55.142
[Joe] Maybe it's more like,
"Nothing ever really changes."

39:56.936 --> 39:58.687
[pop music playing over speakers]

40:05.111 --> 40:06.153
[bells chiming]

40:07.738 --> 40:09.573
-Hey.
-You're not closed yet, are you?

40:09.657 --> 40:13.369
No, Gil, hey. You're just in time.
What can I get you?

40:14.453 --> 40:17.832
-How about half a dozen blueberry?
-Coming right up.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.585
Hey, I haven't seen Margaret.

40:21.669 --> 40:26.090
-Wanna tell her I said hi?
-Yeah, yeah, that's actually why I'm here.

40:26.841 --> 40:28.175
Margaret would have come too,

40:28.259 --> 40:31.887
but she took the girls to her mom's
while they're recovering.

40:31.971 --> 40:33.973
Oh. Were they sick?

40:34.056 --> 40:35.141
Not anymore.

40:35.766 --> 40:37.143
But they both had it.

40:37.810 --> 40:40.813
Can't tell you how sorry we are
for exposing Henry.

40:42.982 --> 40:44.984
Both your daughters had measles?

40:45.067 --> 40:48.028
Margaret really regrets not saying
anything when you called.

40:48.112 --> 40:51.323
She was just stunned to hear
that Henry had to be hospitalized.

40:51.407 --> 40:53.742
Our girls were pretty minor.

40:54.994 --> 40:57.204
We hope you won't hold it against us.

40:58.330 --> 41:01.542
You see, we just don't believe
in subjecting kids

41:01.625 --> 41:03.711
to toxic injections they don't need

41:03.794 --> 41:06.380
to fight things
their bodies were created to fight.

41:06.464 --> 41:09.842
We don't judge people who do, of course.

41:10.551 --> 41:14.263
Anyway, I-- Jeez.
I didn't come here to get on a soapbox.

41:14.346 --> 41:17.057
Again, we apologize.

41:17.725 --> 41:21.020
The most important thing is
that everyone is better now, right?

41:27.151 --> 41:27.985
Thanks.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.075
-Hey, Gil?
-Yep?

41:45.211 --> 41:46.754
