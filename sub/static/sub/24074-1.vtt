00:37.735 --> 00:39.602

01:49.909 --> 01:51.341
Uh!

01:51.343 --> 01:52.612
Shh!

01:53.846 --> 01:55.748
Take it, take it.

01:56.614 --> 01:58.384
Take it.

03:02.480 --> 03:04.548
Oh!

03:04.550 --> 03:06.549
Jeez. These are heavier.
I'll take care of it.

03:06.551 --> 03:09.620
No, I'll do it. I'm pregnant,
I'm not disabled.

03:09.622 --> 03:10.786
Honey, you shouldn't even
be carrying anything

03:10.788 --> 03:12.422
in the first place.

03:12.424 --> 03:14.558
I'm aware of
what I shouldn't be doing.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.727
No sushi, no dental x-rays

03:16.729 --> 03:18.461
no bean sprouts for some reason.

03:18.463 --> 03:19.895
Honey, you have a month left.

03:19.897 --> 03:21.631
Then you can have
all the bean sprouts you want.

03:21.633 --> 03:22.766
I don't even like bean sprouts.

03:22.768 --> 03:23.834
I just want them
because they say

03:23.836 --> 03:25.838
I can't have them.

03:28.941 --> 03:31.774
I'm in a... strange house

03:31.776 --> 03:35.779
in a strange town
full of strange people

03:35.781 --> 03:38.815
with nothing to do
and nowhere to go.

03:38.817 --> 03:41.454
Are the suburbs really that bad?

03:43.756 --> 03:46.889
Okay. You know what?
I'm gonna make you breakfast.

03:46.891 --> 03:49.592
At our old place, we'd just grab
a bagel across the street.

03:49.594 --> 03:50.893
Oh, come on,
they have bagels here.

03:50.895 --> 03:53.030
Uh, no, they have
exotic pastries

03:53.032 --> 03:54.798
with holes in the middle.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.532
It's an abomination.

03:56.534 --> 04:00.070
Uh, I thought you went
to the store yesterday.

04:00.072 --> 04:01.173
I did.

04:03.008 --> 04:05.475
The supermarkets here are
the size of airport hangars.

04:05.477 --> 04:06.977
I got overwhelmed.

04:06.979 --> 04:10.479
Maybe I can get my mom
to pick up some stuff for us.

04:10.481 --> 04:12.916
Or not. Don't have to do that.

04:12.918 --> 04:15.918
Let's get some food. Uh...

04:15.920 --> 04:18.889
Oh. What do we have here?
Is this the melon?

04:18.891 --> 04:21.791
Is this the latest
of your cravings?

04:21.793 --> 04:26.630
They say, this week
she's the size of a honeydew.

04:26.632 --> 04:28.498
Hm.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.567
Does that look right?

04:30.569 --> 04:32.769
I don't know.

04:32.771 --> 04:34.674
But I can't wait
to meet our honeydew.

04:36.007 --> 04:38.541
Can I have a slice of honeydew
for breakfast?

04:38.543 --> 04:40.676
You may not eat our child.

04:40.678 --> 04:44.950
Wow. Overprotective mother,
already. That's sad.

04:48.853 --> 04:51.521
It's Sunday. Do you really
have to go into the office?

04:51.523 --> 04:52.856
Well, if I'm gonna take
a month off

04:52.858 --> 04:54.524
to spend it with you
and the honeydew,

04:54.526 --> 04:55.992
I gotta clear my caseload now.

04:55.994 --> 04:59.829
I know. It's just, we gotta
whip this house into shape.

04:59.831 --> 05:01.798
I'll unpack
some more stuff tonight.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.033
It's fine. I can do it.

05:03.035 --> 05:04.601
Well, I know you can do it.

05:04.603 --> 05:06.702
You can do anything.

05:06.704 --> 05:09.606
I just prefer
if you don't, okay?

05:09.608 --> 05:12.541
Just try to enjoy your free time
while you still have it.

05:12.543 --> 05:16.113
Free time? Is that what we're
calling unemployment now?

05:16.115 --> 05:19.082
- Yup.
- I just need something to do.

05:19.084 --> 05:20.817
My mom says
the neighbors are great.

05:20.819 --> 05:24.553
And she says there is
a fantastic bagel place nearby.

05:24.555 --> 05:26.022
Home of the blueberry
bacon bagel?

05:26.024 --> 05:27.690
It just sounds wrong.

05:27.692 --> 05:30.093
- It could be good.
- I'll try it.

05:30.095 --> 05:32.695
But only because I'm hungry.

05:32.697 --> 05:33.997
And because of bacon.

05:33.999 --> 05:36.703
I love you. And you, honeydew.

05:39.605 --> 05:41.641
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:56.053 --> 05:57.723
Hi, neighbor.

06:02.060 --> 06:03.696
Okay.

06:22.079 --> 06:25.151
I'm so sorry about this,
but I'm really desperate.

06:28.153 --> 06:29.652
Do you mind... Oh!

06:30.855 --> 06:32.721
I'm so sorry.

06:32.723 --> 06:35.759
I didn't mean to scare you.

06:35.761 --> 06:37.163
I'm Grace.

06:38.163 --> 06:40.697
I live across the street.

06:40.699 --> 06:43.098
You met my husband this morning.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.668
- What?
- Yes.

06:44.670 --> 06:47.837
He was walking our dog.

06:47.839 --> 06:50.774
Oh. I wouldn't really say
that we met, but...

06:50.776 --> 06:55.245
Oh. You're having a boy, I see.

06:55.247 --> 06:57.813
A girl, actually.

06:57.815 --> 06:59.748
Are you sure? Uh...

06:59.750 --> 07:03.820
- You're carrying so high.
- The doctors insist.

07:03.822 --> 07:06.789
Oh, doctors don't know anything.

07:06.791 --> 07:09.892
Ah, you have a lovely

07:09.894 --> 07:12.796
yellow aura right now.

07:12.798 --> 07:14.197
When are you due?

07:14.199 --> 07:17.800
- Four weeks.
- Oh. A full moon baby.

07:17.802 --> 07:19.935
Very powerful.

07:19.937 --> 07:22.772
Powerful is good, I guess.

07:22.774 --> 07:26.077
Patricia's told me
all about you.

07:27.211 --> 07:31.081
Yeah, I could have sworn
she said a boy.

07:31.083 --> 07:33.949
I bought my house from her
years ago.

07:33.951 --> 07:36.286
She's such a sweet person.

07:36.288 --> 07:40.927
Always trust an Aries, I say.

07:41.959 --> 07:43.728
Absolutely.

07:48.065 --> 07:52.235
Hi. I'm Yvonne.
You must be Rachel.

07:52.237 --> 07:55.137
- I live across the street.
- Let me guess.

07:55.139 --> 07:57.973
- Patricia told you all about me.
- How'd you know?

07:57.975 --> 07:59.843
Peter's mom
seems to have a tight hold

07:59.845 --> 08:01.243
on the neighborhood.

08:01.245 --> 08:02.878
I'm really glad you're here.

08:02.880 --> 08:05.048
The old neighbors
were so antisocial.

08:05.050 --> 08:06.983
None of us were surprised
when they got divorced.

08:06.985 --> 08:10.719
Well, we're not even married, so
our divorce is a long way off.

08:10.721 --> 08:12.822
Oh, handsome man like that.

08:12.824 --> 08:15.058
Smart to lock him in
however you can.

08:15.060 --> 08:17.026
The key is keeping them
interested after a long day

08:17.028 --> 08:18.762
at the office.

08:18.764 --> 08:19.930
Is that the key?

08:19.932 --> 08:21.298
I just had a child
six months ago.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.065
You couldn't tell, could you?

08:23.067 --> 08:25.538
Uh, so where's your child now?

08:29.274 --> 08:31.074
My best piece of advice?

08:31.076 --> 08:33.142
Hire help
and outsource the hard stuff.

08:33.144 --> 08:36.946
Without Orla, I could never have
gotten my body back so fast.

08:36.948 --> 08:39.049
Oh, uh, we won't be
hiring a nanny.

08:39.051 --> 08:40.749
I'm just between jobs right now.

08:40.751 --> 08:42.818
Oh. What do you do?

08:42.821 --> 08:45.055
I'm a writer, and an editor

08:45.057 --> 08:46.890
for newspapers
which, unfortunately,

08:46.892 --> 08:48.223
don't really exist anymore.

08:48.225 --> 08:51.861
- Well, I'm a writer, too.
- Really? For what?

08:51.863 --> 08:54.897
I have a blog. Mom stuff.
You should send me some samples.

08:54.899 --> 08:56.166
I'm always looking
for freelancers.

08:56.168 --> 08:58.767
I can pay in exposure
and experience.

08:58.769 --> 09:00.869
Thanks, but, uh,
I think I'll concentrate

09:00.871 --> 09:02.204
on the mom thing for now.

09:02.206 --> 09:05.208
Pretty soon, the mom thing
will be the only thing.

09:05.210 --> 09:06.810
Oh.

09:06.812 --> 09:09.945
My heart rate's dropping.
I gotta go.

09:09.947 --> 09:14.220
Anyhow, if you ever wanna go for
a run, I'm always on the move.

09:16.020 --> 09:19.190
Well, it was great
to meet you, too.

09:22.793 --> 09:24.094
Yvonne doesn't realize
that we're not all here

09:24.096 --> 09:25.395
to entertain her.

09:25.397 --> 09:27.296
I'm Sandy. I live next door.

09:27.298 --> 09:29.932
Oh. Rachel.

09:29.934 --> 09:33.002
- Let me help you with that.
- Oh. No, really, it's okay.

09:33.004 --> 09:34.273
- I got it.
- Um...

09:36.008 --> 09:38.340
Okay, well,
maybe just to the front door.

09:38.342 --> 09:40.343
Please, really,
you don't have to do that.

09:40.345 --> 09:43.046
I am happy to help.

09:43.048 --> 09:46.251
And besides, I always like
to get to know my neighbors.

09:47.885 --> 09:50.119
- Where do you want these?
- Uh, anywhere.

09:50.121 --> 09:52.024
- I'll figure it out later.
- Mm.

09:53.158 --> 09:55.157
I met some
of our neighbors today.

09:55.159 --> 09:58.927
Let me guess.
Gary, the silent dog walker.

09:58.929 --> 10:00.095
He doesn't talk much,
which works out

10:00.097 --> 10:02.431
because his wife Grace
doesn't shut up.

10:02.433 --> 10:04.367
- She read my aura.
- Ah.

10:04.369 --> 10:06.236
Other than the fact
that she sometimes dances naked

10:06.238 --> 10:09.939
in her backyard under
the full moon, she's harmless.

10:09.941 --> 10:12.142
- And you met Yvonne.
- Mm-hm.

10:12.144 --> 10:14.844
The workout queen.

10:14.846 --> 10:16.912
I walk every day, too,
but I do not treat it

10:16.914 --> 10:18.281
like the Olympic trials.

10:18.283 --> 10:21.117
Apparently,
she's also a blogger.

10:21.119 --> 10:23.252
But she doesn't look like
she just had a kid, though.

10:23.254 --> 10:25.854
So maybe I should go read it.

10:25.856 --> 10:27.257
Yeah, well,
she's not exactly the most,

10:27.259 --> 10:30.129
how should I put it,
hands-on mother.

10:31.395 --> 10:33.430
I seem to be the talk
of the block.

10:33.432 --> 10:35.265
Well, nothing much happens
around here.

10:35.267 --> 10:39.169
So a new neighbor,
now, that's interesting.

10:39.171 --> 10:42.204
What about you?
How long have you lived here?

10:42.206 --> 10:45.141
And I bet I know
who sold you your house.

10:45.143 --> 10:46.876
- Patricia?
- Mm-hm.

10:46.878 --> 10:48.210
Well, she keeps telling me
it's time to sell

10:48.212 --> 10:49.411
but I have a feeling
it's more about

10:49.413 --> 10:51.013
her commission than it is about

10:51.015 --> 10:52.283
finding my dream home.

10:54.019 --> 10:58.188
So, what brought you
to our little neighborhood?

10:58.190 --> 11:01.458
We needed something quieter,
and safer.

11:01.460 --> 11:03.392
And boring?

11:03.394 --> 11:06.496
I, uh, had a bad experience
at our old place

11:06.498 --> 11:10.032
and Peter, the, uh... father

11:10.034 --> 11:11.434
kinda freaked out.

11:11.436 --> 11:13.435
So here we are.

11:13.437 --> 11:16.039
And when you saw this house,
you thought...

11:16.041 --> 11:17.973
"This is exactly
where I wanna be bored."

11:17.975 --> 11:20.413
I did fall in love
with one room.

11:23.148 --> 11:25.151
Welcome to the nursery.

11:26.518 --> 11:29.118
Are you okay?

11:29.120 --> 11:32.454
Yeah. I mean,
you guys are lucky.

11:32.456 --> 11:34.056
My husband...

11:34.058 --> 11:37.326
ex-husband and I tried,
but we couldn't...

11:37.328 --> 11:39.929
I-I couldn't get pregnant.

11:39.931 --> 11:41.998
And then we got divorced,

11:42.000 --> 11:45.203
so... I guess it all worked out
for the best.

11:47.938 --> 11:50.440
So, is the plan to have the kid
sleep on the floor?

11:50.442 --> 11:53.243
Oh, we haven't had the chance
to put anything together.

11:53.245 --> 11:54.310
Well, what are you doing now?

11:54.312 --> 11:55.344
I have been banned

11:55.346 --> 11:57.412
from moving boxes.

11:57.414 --> 12:00.349
I'll do the heavy lifting,
you do the soft and frilly.

12:00.351 --> 12:02.218
Let's whip this nursery
into shape.

12:02.220 --> 12:04.052
Seriously?

12:04.054 --> 12:07.058
Come on. What are neighbors for?

12:08.426 --> 12:10.062
Okay.

12:11.296 --> 12:12.765
Okay.

12:27.412 --> 12:29.048
It's perfect.

12:30.315 --> 12:32.581
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

12:32.583 --> 12:34.983
I haven't had this much fun
in a long time.

12:34.985 --> 12:36.254
Me, too.

12:37.254 --> 12:39.421
I love this poster.

12:39.423 --> 12:40.989
Yeah.

12:40.991 --> 12:42.291
So she grows up adventurous.

12:42.293 --> 12:44.560
- Mm.
- A dream.

12:44.562 --> 12:46.528
So she can do all those things
without a man.

12:46.530 --> 12:49.598
- I hear you there.
- Ah. Mm.

12:54.339 --> 12:55.405
Those things are great,
you can actually

12:55.407 --> 12:57.140
stream to your phone.

12:57.142 --> 12:58.473
Isn't technology something?

13:00.010 --> 13:02.011
Looks like my work here is done.

13:02.013 --> 13:04.247
I am right next door.

13:04.249 --> 13:07.153
If you need anything, just wave.

13:09.086 --> 13:10.822
<i>Thank you, neighbor.</i>

13:23.400 --> 13:25.403
Someone loves attention.

13:29.441 --> 13:31.076
What's that?

13:32.543 --> 13:34.179
Nothing.

13:36.147 --> 13:39.181
- I met our neighbors today.
- Mm-hmm.

13:39.183 --> 13:42.822
Your mother has told them
everything about me, apparently.

13:43.621 --> 13:45.387
One read my aura,

13:45.389 --> 13:47.589
and the other has a mom blog

13:47.591 --> 13:50.059
and wants me to be her intern.

13:50.061 --> 13:52.527
She does offer
exposure and experience though.

13:52.529 --> 13:57.300
Yeah, well, my old neighbor
used to speak to his pet ferret.

13:57.302 --> 14:00.435
But his parties
were so much fun.

14:00.437 --> 14:05.076
Here it's just a mix
of boring and crazy.

14:09.246 --> 14:13.485
A boring childhood
in a nice house in the suburbs.

14:14.485 --> 14:16.551
Not so bad, eh, honeydew?

14:16.553 --> 14:18.521
Ooh!

14:18.523 --> 14:20.355
What was that?

14:20.357 --> 14:23.358
- She kicked me.
- What?

14:23.360 --> 14:26.365
Bad baby. Don't kick your mom.

14:27.532 --> 14:30.233
Getting bored in there?

14:30.235 --> 14:35.137
No TV or Wi-Fi for nine months
would drive me crazy, too.

14:35.139 --> 14:39.374
At least you're not a... fat,
hormone-charged rhinoceros

14:39.376 --> 14:42.411
that can smell everything, but
can't even put on her own shoes.

14:42.413 --> 14:44.884
You're not a rhino.

14:47.719 --> 14:49.922
Any chance for a back rub?

14:51.255 --> 14:53.156
Is this for you or for the baby?

14:54.558 --> 14:56.658
Ooh. Great.
Right in the bladder.

14:56.660 --> 14:58.527
Okay. Give me a sec.

14:58.529 --> 15:00.231
- Okay.
- Ah.

15:23.488 --> 15:25.157
Peter?

16:37.327 --> 16:39.228
- Who's there?
- There you are.

16:44.701 --> 16:46.669
I didn't mean to scare you.

16:46.671 --> 16:49.638
Um, I let myself in.

16:49.640 --> 16:53.511
I was worried that
the two of you weren't eating.

16:56.815 --> 16:59.585
Mm, someone went shopping.

17:01.519 --> 17:03.786
I'll sleep in the, uh,
guest room tonight.

17:03.788 --> 17:06.790
And then breakfast can be
bright and early tomorrow.

17:09.794 --> 17:11.597
Do you need help with that?

17:13.565 --> 17:15.034
I'm fine.

17:16.334 --> 17:18.336
Well, good night.

17:28.779 --> 17:30.446
Do you think
it's a good idea for Rachel

17:30.448 --> 17:32.451
to be here all alone all day?

17:33.550 --> 17:35.553
She's perfectly fine.

17:37.622 --> 17:40.288
I know that I have given you
great confidence

17:40.290 --> 17:42.424
that a woman can do it all,

17:42.426 --> 17:44.594
but it's hard.

17:44.596 --> 17:47.462
I mean, working,
raising a child,

17:47.464 --> 17:51.801
making healthy breakfasts
every day, alone.

17:51.803 --> 17:56.572
And we appreciate everything
that you've done for us.

17:56.574 --> 17:59.574
This is a great neighborhood,
Mom. Thank you.

17:59.576 --> 18:02.879
Oh, I met our neighbor
Sandy yesterday.

18:02.881 --> 18:05.715
She helped me put together
the nursery.

18:05.717 --> 18:08.320
Did she?
What was she doing here?

18:09.420 --> 18:11.586
I let her in.

18:11.588 --> 18:13.756
Some people knock first.

18:13.758 --> 18:17.492
Oh, yes. Last night.

18:17.494 --> 18:20.496
I don't think that a woman
in your condition

18:20.498 --> 18:23.365
should be playing
security guard.

18:23.367 --> 18:26.869
Or... you could just
not break in

18:26.871 --> 18:29.505
to a pregnant woman's home.

18:29.507 --> 18:31.474
Well, I didn't break in.
I have a key.

18:31.476 --> 18:34.379
They give you one
when you make the down payment.

18:37.481 --> 18:39.617
Can you stand up for me
just once?

18:40.951 --> 18:42.785
Unbelievable.

18:42.787 --> 18:44.353
- Uh, here...
- Just...

18:44.355 --> 18:47.826
No! Just leave it. Ah.

20:43.641 --> 20:44.776
Mm.

21:22.680 --> 21:23.949
Not again.

21:41.531 --> 21:42.667
What?

22:13.798 --> 22:15.000
Oh, my...

22:17.667 --> 22:19.067
No!

22:19.069 --> 22:20.971
No, no!

22:24.642 --> 22:26.574
What's happening? Are you okay?

22:26.576 --> 22:28.710
Uh... It looked like
a fight across the street.

22:28.712 --> 22:31.115
- I think someone's hurt.
- What?

22:35.619 --> 22:36.951
I don't see anything.

22:36.953 --> 22:39.622
<i>911. What's your
emergency?</i>

22:39.624 --> 22:41.090
You called the police?

22:41.092 --> 22:42.725
<i>911. Hello.</i>

22:42.727 --> 22:44.794
Hi, I, I'd like to report a,

22:44.796 --> 22:45.997
a domestic altercation.

22:54.872 --> 22:56.738
So i-it seems like
it was all just

22:56.740 --> 22:58.039
a pretty big misunderstanding.

22:58.041 --> 23:01.610
I would say so.
Yvonne is quite upset.

23:01.612 --> 23:02.812
Is everyone okay?

23:02.814 --> 23:04.880
Everyone's fine.
Both of them are fine.

23:04.882 --> 23:07.783
It was just a heated dispute
between husband and wife.

23:07.785 --> 23:09.017
- No injuries.
- There were three people there.

23:09.019 --> 23:10.619
The nanny, too.

23:10.621 --> 23:12.822
Uh, they said the nanny
quit this afternoon.

23:12.824 --> 23:14.757
They were arguing
about whose fault it was.

23:14.759 --> 23:16.659
No, I'm telling you,
I saw the nanny.

23:16.661 --> 23:18.697
Did you have a clear view
of the altercation?

23:20.064 --> 23:22.898
Well, I mean,
the blinds were closed.

23:22.900 --> 23:24.803
But, yeah.

23:26.069 --> 23:27.769
You'll have to
excuse her.

23:27.771 --> 23:30.639
Um, she survived an attack
near her old home,

23:30.641 --> 23:33.042
and I think her anxieties are
just getting the best of her.

23:33.044 --> 23:35.678
Mom, that's not fair.

23:35.680 --> 23:38.146
Honey, I came by last
night to drop off some food,

23:38.148 --> 23:40.181
and she treated me
like I was a cat burglar.

23:40.183 --> 23:41.917
That's completely different.

23:41.919 --> 23:45.921
This is not a downtown slum
with drug fiends.

23:45.923 --> 23:47.756
I know what I saw.

23:47.758 --> 23:50.159
Um, honey,
I know what you think you saw.

23:50.161 --> 23:52.928
The cops checked it out.

23:52.930 --> 23:56.065
I, I'm not the only one
who saw her.

23:56.067 --> 23:59.067
Gary, the dog guy, saw her, too.

23:59.069 --> 24:02.136
The other neighbor,
we talked to him.

24:02.138 --> 24:04.038
He didn't see anything.

24:04.040 --> 24:06.875
What? No, that's impossible.

24:06.877 --> 24:08.911
- Ah!
- Are you okay?

24:08.913 --> 24:10.078
I've got a bowling ball
on my bladder,

24:10.080 --> 24:11.080
and everyone thinks I'm a liar.

24:11.082 --> 24:12.680
Yeah, I'm just peachy.

24:12.682 --> 24:13.949
I am so sorry, officers.

24:13.951 --> 24:15.918
Um, she's all hormones
and nerves...

24:15.920 --> 24:18.056
This is not hormones!

24:19.789 --> 24:22.091
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah, here.

24:22.093 --> 24:23.992
- The officers are almost done.
- Yeah.

24:23.994 --> 24:26.862
Well, your granddaughter just
lodged her foot in my urethra,

24:26.864 --> 24:28.900
so I'm gonna go take care
of that first.

24:29.866 --> 24:31.470
Excuse me.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.043
Uh, thanks for coming by.

24:42.813 --> 24:44.816
I'll show you hormones.

24:45.750 --> 24:47.885
Here we go.

24:59.297 --> 25:00.731
Peter!

25:09.173 --> 25:10.838
Your baby is healthy.

25:10.840 --> 25:13.776
Everything is intact.

25:13.778 --> 25:16.045
But bleeding like this
is a concern.

25:16.047 --> 25:17.779
It is our recommendation

25:17.781 --> 25:20.048
that you go on bed rest
until you deliver.

25:20.050 --> 25:23.852
It's important to reduce stress,
both physical and emotional.

25:23.854 --> 25:25.955
So we need you to be
on the lookout for headaches,

25:25.957 --> 25:28.257
blurred vision,
sensitivity to light,

25:28.259 --> 25:31.994
vomiting, abdominal pain,
or any unexplained bruising.

25:31.996 --> 25:33.761
If you experience
any of these symptoms,

25:33.763 --> 25:35.296
you need to contact me
immediately.

25:35.298 --> 25:38.167
If you can't reach me, call 911.

25:38.169 --> 25:39.334
And please,

25:39.336 --> 25:42.270
let people help
take care of you.

25:42.272 --> 25:44.172
It's important.

25:44.174 --> 25:45.911
For both of you.

25:47.044 --> 25:48.876
Thank you.

25:48.878 --> 25:50.314
Thank you, Doctor.

26:07.263 --> 26:08.896
Wait. Here,
I'll help you.

26:14.270 --> 26:16.337
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Rachel, what're you doing?

26:16.339 --> 26:17.873
The doctor said
you needed to rest.

26:17.875 --> 26:19.007
I'm going to talk to Yvonne.

26:19.009 --> 26:20.209
My mom already talked to her.

26:20.211 --> 26:21.809
Oh, I'm sure she did.

26:21.811 --> 26:23.011
"Rachel is pregnant
and hormonal.

26:23.013 --> 26:24.078
An overactive mind."

26:24.080 --> 26:25.847
Well, are you going to apologize

26:25.849 --> 26:27.082
or to investigate?

26:27.084 --> 26:28.883
I'm going to talk
to my neighbor.

26:28.885 --> 26:30.219
Like an adult.

26:30.221 --> 26:32.220
You really should be
in bed resting.

26:32.222 --> 26:35.123
Look, I might be seeing things,
I might be crazy,

26:35.125 --> 26:36.824
but I'm not gonna
lock myself inside

26:36.826 --> 26:39.364
for the rest of my life
on the off-chance.

26:56.846 --> 26:58.846
- Yvonne, can we...
- I have nothing to say to you.

26:58.848 --> 27:00.449
Yvonne...

27:01.852 --> 27:03.121
Please.

27:18.234 --> 27:20.070
She wouldn't talk to you?

27:21.305 --> 27:23.875
No. She wanted nothing
to do with me.

27:25.276 --> 27:27.276
Maybe just give her some time?

27:27.278 --> 27:28.913
I don't know.

27:33.983 --> 27:35.918
I've cancelled
all my obligations.

27:35.920 --> 27:37.922
I'm here to help.

27:41.991 --> 27:45.294
Of course, if I'm in the way,
I'm happy to pay for a nurse.

27:45.296 --> 27:47.028
N-no.

27:47.030 --> 27:48.932
We'd love to have you.

27:51.035 --> 27:52.237
Great.

28:40.151 --> 28:42.420
You saw something,
you old bastard.

29:18.556 --> 29:21.326
Rachel? Is that you?

29:31.035 --> 29:34.404
Well, if you need anything,
I'm in the kitchen.

29:45.048 --> 29:47.315
- Hello there.
- Is your husband home?

29:47.317 --> 29:48.549
I'd like to ask him a question.

29:48.551 --> 29:51.253
Gary is resting right now,

29:51.255 --> 29:54.189
which,
if I'm not mistaken,

29:54.191 --> 29:57.459
is what I believe
you're supposed to be doing.

29:57.461 --> 30:01.529
Patricia's told me
all about your, your condition.

30:01.531 --> 30:03.198
I think he saw something
last night.

30:03.200 --> 30:05.202
Why didn't he tell the police?

30:06.436 --> 30:09.470
Uh, Gary has
not been himself

30:09.472 --> 30:12.039
in a, in a long time, dear.

30:12.041 --> 30:14.178
But I saw him watching
the nanny.

30:16.480 --> 30:19.347
Why are you harassing
my husband?

30:19.349 --> 30:20.649
It's bad enough
he has Alzheimer's.

30:20.651 --> 30:23.084
Now you want to give him
a heart attack

30:23.086 --> 30:24.518
by calling the police

30:24.520 --> 30:28.190
to grill him with questions?

30:28.192 --> 30:30.324
I highly recommend
you mind your own business

30:30.326 --> 30:33.194
and leave my husband
out of whatever trouble

30:33.196 --> 30:35.332
you're trying to whip up.

30:36.567 --> 30:38.667
And in the future...

30:38.669 --> 30:42.336
I suggest you stay to
your side of the block...

30:42.338 --> 30:46.277
or next time
<i>I</i> will call the police.

30:59.390 --> 31:01.593
You know,
you didn't do anything wrong.

31:02.593 --> 31:04.226
I think I did.

31:04.228 --> 31:06.428
Don't let them
make you think you're crazy.

31:06.430 --> 31:08.363
You got mama bear instincts.

31:08.365 --> 31:10.498
You should follow
your intuition.

31:10.500 --> 31:11.568
Thanks.

31:13.503 --> 31:16.404
I'm gonna be in <i>big</i> trouble
when I go home, aren't I?

31:16.406 --> 31:20.510
Probably. But, since you're
already playing hooky...

31:23.113 --> 31:24.649
we might as well have some fun.

31:42.700 --> 31:44.699
Hm.

31:44.701 --> 31:46.401
It's actually not that bad.

31:46.403 --> 31:49.603
It's not bad,
but this is not a bagel.

31:49.605 --> 31:51.238
True.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.307
This town has a knack
of trading quality

31:53.309 --> 31:55.276
for convenience.

31:55.278 --> 31:57.682
And here I come
and screw it all up.

31:58.682 --> 32:02.417
Well... I believe you.

32:02.419 --> 32:03.922
Really?

32:05.556 --> 32:07.521
The nanny and the husband
have been having an affair

32:07.523 --> 32:09.426
for a few months.

32:10.461 --> 32:12.427
You don't think...

32:12.429 --> 32:14.429
Yvonne, like...

32:14.431 --> 32:16.597
You know?

32:16.599 --> 32:19.500
No. No, Yvonne wouldn't
kill anybody.

32:19.502 --> 32:20.701
She probably just
shooed her out the back

32:20.703 --> 32:22.738
as soon as
she saw the cops coming.

32:22.740 --> 32:26.408
The nanny was
working here illegally.

32:26.410 --> 32:29.710
Now, the true tragedy is that
Yvonne has to raise her own kid.

32:29.712 --> 32:32.180
Hm.

32:32.182 --> 32:34.716
People here are living lies
on top of lies,

32:34.718 --> 32:36.354
on top of more lies.

32:37.587 --> 32:40.455
It's easy to get tripped up.

32:40.457 --> 32:43.324
So I guess I'm safe from
the neighborhood axe-murderer.

32:43.326 --> 32:45.660
Grace might curse you
on the next waning moon,

32:45.662 --> 32:49.230
but otherwise,
you should be okay.

32:49.232 --> 32:53.701
Although, I would also
avoid Yvonne's latest blog.

32:53.703 --> 32:56.705
<i>The Perils
of the Nosey Neighbor.</i>

32:56.707 --> 32:57.738
What?

32:57.740 --> 32:59.274
Yvonne is all about

32:59.276 --> 33:00.741
her public persona.

33:00.743 --> 33:04.481
But don't worry,
she didn't name any names.

33:06.482 --> 33:07.751
But she does hold grudges.

33:23.232 --> 33:25.433
You had me
very worried.

33:25.435 --> 33:27.436
No, disappearing with strangers,

33:27.438 --> 33:30.337
spying on your neighbors.

33:30.339 --> 33:31.573
Are you that desperate

33:31.575 --> 33:34.442
to get a sensational
true crime story

33:34.444 --> 33:36.411
to impress your
caffeine-stained editor

33:36.413 --> 33:37.845
of that dying newspaper?

33:37.847 --> 33:39.648
No, I just wanted answers

33:39.650 --> 33:41.650
and then Sandy took me
to get a bagel.

33:41.652 --> 33:43.317
I just...

33:43.319 --> 33:44.788
I needed a friend.

33:47.490 --> 33:49.423
Well, I almost
called the police.

33:49.425 --> 33:51.826
That's how afraid I was.

33:51.828 --> 33:54.595
Peter had to talk me down.

33:54.597 --> 33:57.634
You owe him a big apology.

33:58.669 --> 34:00.334
And until that happens,

34:00.336 --> 34:03.270
would you just stay in your bed?

34:03.272 --> 34:06.540
You have one job to do now.

34:06.542 --> 34:10.277
Take care of this baby.

34:10.280 --> 34:13.083
And if you won't help yourself,
I cannot help you.

34:33.436 --> 34:34.505
You're up.

34:37.440 --> 34:40.306
Peter is working late.
He called while you were asleep.

34:40.309 --> 34:42.447
I've, uh, brought you
some dinner.

34:50.554 --> 34:51.822
Thank you.

34:56.726 --> 34:58.492
Peter and I thought that
it would be a good time

34:58.494 --> 35:00.695
for you to take a break
from your phone and computer.

35:00.697 --> 35:03.632
They seem to be...

35:03.634 --> 35:05.934
stimulating your imagination.

35:05.936 --> 35:08.603
I need to look at job postings.

35:08.605 --> 35:10.738
And really, everything.

35:10.740 --> 35:13.508
Oh, no, I already told Peter
that I'm more than happy

35:13.510 --> 35:16.414
to financially support
both of you, if necessary.

35:17.380 --> 35:19.648
Anything for the baby.

35:19.650 --> 35:21.652
I'm going back to work.

35:22.719 --> 35:24.722
That's what all women think.

35:26.623 --> 35:29.624
What if I have an emergency?

35:29.626 --> 35:32.630
Ring the bell.
I'll get you whatever you need.

35:39.769 --> 35:41.505
For the baby.

36:05.661 --> 36:07.561
Knock, knock.

36:07.563 --> 36:10.898
- Oh, I'm so happy you're home.
- Court let out early.

36:10.900 --> 36:13.668
And it's also Mom's
bridge night tonight.

36:13.670 --> 36:15.436
So I thought to myself,

36:15.438 --> 36:17.707
"Hey, we could actually have
a night to ourselves."

36:19.675 --> 36:21.543
I ordered Chinese.

36:32.822 --> 36:35.657
- You look lovely.
- Thank you.

36:35.659 --> 36:37.592
Um, I wasn't sure
what you'd be craving,

36:37.594 --> 36:39.864
so, I just got everything.

36:41.498 --> 36:43.565
That is a lot of food.

36:43.567 --> 36:44.833
Yeah.

36:44.835 --> 36:46.836
Hm, gotta take care
of my baby mama.

36:47.971 --> 36:49.606
After you.

36:54.010 --> 36:55.709
Then the bailiff had to
drag the guy

36:55.711 --> 36:56.911
screaming from the courtroom

36:56.913 --> 36:58.612
while the judge
held him in contempt.

36:58.614 --> 37:01.516
Ah. Well, that's one way
to undermine the witness.

37:01.518 --> 37:02.717
Yeah, I think it's safe to say,

37:02.719 --> 37:03.885
we have this one
in the bag now.

37:03.887 --> 37:04.922
Mm-hm.

37:11.661 --> 37:12.929
What?

37:13.996 --> 37:15.632
Nothing.

37:18.467 --> 37:20.501
I was just thinking
about the time we met.

37:20.503 --> 37:21.903
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

37:21.905 --> 37:24.972
You were constantly
on the move in college.

37:24.974 --> 37:27.742
I don't think we ever had
a conversation standing still.

37:27.744 --> 37:29.943
I was always following you
from class or...

37:29.945 --> 37:32.549
to some event that you were
covering for the paper.

37:33.949 --> 37:36.684
But, I couldn't keep up.

37:36.686 --> 37:37.918
And then ten years later,

37:37.920 --> 37:39.820
I see you running
through the courthouse.

37:39.822 --> 37:41.655
You were just a blur,
you just ran right past me,

37:41.657 --> 37:42.926
but I knew it was you.

37:44.094 --> 37:46.594
And this time...

37:46.596 --> 37:48.632
I finally chased you down.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.865
Well...

37:51.867 --> 37:54.101
I'm a little easier
to catch now.

37:54.103 --> 37:55.739
Yeah.

37:56.606 --> 37:57.771
Mm.

37:57.773 --> 37:59.874
I am stuffed.

37:59.876 --> 38:01.742
And I think this...

38:01.744 --> 38:04.514
honeydew has grown
into a watermelon.

38:08.652 --> 38:10.985
We needed this, didn't we?

38:10.987 --> 38:13.822
My mom around all the time.

38:13.824 --> 38:16.724
And me locked in a tower.

38:16.726 --> 38:18.663
Is it really that bad?

38:20.063 --> 38:23.063
I haven't made it easy on her.

38:23.065 --> 38:25.934
Well, we've all been
trying our best.

38:25.936 --> 38:27.938
It's a tough situation.

38:29.672 --> 38:30.674
I know.

38:32.842 --> 38:34.108
I just...

38:34.110 --> 38:35.844
I feel so cooped up in here,
you know?

38:35.846 --> 38:37.077
Mm-hm.

38:37.079 --> 38:39.079
I need to be outside, I...

38:39.081 --> 38:41.849
I need to feel the sun
on my face.

38:41.851 --> 38:43.083
Well...

38:43.085 --> 38:45.954
maybe tomorrow
we can get you outside

38:45.956 --> 38:48.092
in a way that makes
everybody happy.

38:50.693 --> 38:53.094
- I'd love that.
- Yeah?

38:53.096 --> 38:55.028
Yeah.

38:55.030 --> 38:56.067
Okay.

38:57.634 --> 38:58.702
Okay.

39:16.686 --> 39:18.689
It's nice back here, right?

39:19.722 --> 39:21.625
Your phone, my dear.

39:24.795 --> 39:26.094
Yeah.

39:26.096 --> 39:28.929
I could get used to this
whole backyard thing.

39:28.931 --> 39:30.865
It's like a fire escape,
except...

39:30.867 --> 39:34.135
green, and no threat
of falling to your death.

39:34.137 --> 39:35.606
I baked.

39:36.672 --> 39:38.173
Oh.

39:38.175 --> 39:39.874
Thanks, Patricia.

39:39.876 --> 39:41.778
Fresh air is good for the baby.

39:42.746 --> 39:43.878
Mm-hm.

39:43.880 --> 39:45.648
Thanks, Mom.

39:48.083 --> 39:50.784
- See? She's trying.
- Mm-hm.

39:50.786 --> 39:52.220
- I'll see you after work.
- Mm.

39:52.222 --> 39:54.125
- Bye.
- Bye.

40:17.780 --> 40:20.083
- Howdy, neighbor.
- Hi!

40:21.150 --> 40:23.650
I see you've escaped.

40:23.652 --> 40:25.720
- Time off for good behavior?
- Something like that.

40:27.791 --> 40:30.023
Oh. Hello.

40:30.025 --> 40:31.258
I heard voices.

40:31.260 --> 40:34.195
Oh, don't worry,
I'm not calling the cops.

40:34.197 --> 40:36.130
Sorry, I came in
through the side gate.

40:36.132 --> 40:38.733
Huh. We really do need to get
a new lock for that.

40:38.735 --> 40:40.771
Thank you so much
for reminding me.

40:42.005 --> 40:44.137
So nice to see you, Sandy.

40:44.139 --> 40:45.442
Patricia.

40:46.876 --> 40:49.677
Um, if you're ready
to sell your house,

40:49.679 --> 40:51.246
please, let me know.

40:51.248 --> 40:54.452
I am positive that I have
at least one buyer.

41:00.123 --> 41:01.822
Please don't ever move.

41:01.824 --> 41:03.691
I guarantee
I know who that one buyer is.

41:03.693 --> 41:05.693
She's gonna connect the houses
with the gate

41:05.695 --> 41:06.728
and then never go home.

41:08.864 --> 41:10.999
- How you been?
- I'm okay.

41:11.001 --> 41:13.066
Just trying to keep
the blood pressure down.

41:13.068 --> 41:15.103
Future mother-in-laws
do not help with that.

41:15.105 --> 41:17.738
It's hard for both of us.
I mean...

41:17.740 --> 41:19.706
I've been
kind of emotional lately.

41:19.708 --> 41:21.208
- Don't blame yourself.
- No, I know.

41:21.210 --> 41:24.211
It's just, I've been on edge
ever since we moved out here

41:24.213 --> 41:26.880
and I think I'm just
taking it out on everybody.

41:26.882 --> 41:28.916
You're pregnant,
and you're not supposed to move.

41:28.918 --> 41:30.253
Your anxiety is justified.

41:32.889 --> 41:34.722
Can I tell you a secret?

41:34.724 --> 41:35.992
Sure.

41:36.960 --> 41:39.126
I've...

41:39.128 --> 41:42.229
I've kind of always had
problems with anxiety.

41:42.231 --> 41:44.932
Maybe I still do.

41:44.934 --> 41:47.135
But when I got pregnant,
I had to get off my meds.

41:47.137 --> 41:48.869
Nothing crazy,
just like the normal

41:48.871 --> 41:50.070
anti-depressants you see on TV.

41:50.072 --> 41:51.271
As long as your dog isn't
telling you

41:51.273 --> 41:53.141
to murder anyone, you're fine.

41:53.143 --> 41:54.943
Trust me, I know.

41:54.945 --> 41:57.278
I have tried all of the pills.

41:57.280 --> 41:58.813
Really?

41:58.815 --> 42:00.248
I feel so much better
since I got off

42:00.250 --> 42:02.083
of all that stuff.

42:02.085 --> 42:05.186
You know, it used
to make me feel so foggy.

42:05.188 --> 42:08.856
At first, of course,
it's a shock to your system

42:08.858 --> 42:11.128
and you can get
a little paranoid.

42:14.030 --> 42:16.030
I bet you feel like

42:16.032 --> 42:18.168
everyone is after your baby.

42:20.003 --> 42:22.170
Touching your stomach...

42:22.172 --> 42:24.307
and she's right here...

42:25.240 --> 42:27.909
inside of you.

42:27.911 --> 42:31.045
You can't wait to hold her...

42:31.047 --> 42:33.113
to have her with you...

42:33.115 --> 42:34.985
have her in your arms.

42:38.253 --> 42:41.224
You would do anything
to protect her.

42:43.293 --> 42:45.195
But you can't.

42:46.096 --> 42:48.262
You can't move fast,

42:48.264 --> 42:50.034
you can't escape.

42:51.233 --> 42:53.900
I mean...

42:53.902 --> 42:55.903
what's gonna happen here?

42:55.905 --> 42:58.175
Nothing happens
in the suburbs, right?

44:19.054 --> 44:20.320
Um...

44:20.322 --> 44:23.423
what do you know
about Sandy from next door?

44:23.425 --> 44:26.293
I know I don't like her.

44:26.295 --> 44:28.297
What's that supposed to mean?

44:29.298 --> 44:30.898
Some people belong here,

44:30.900 --> 44:33.501
and, uh, some people don't.

44:33.503 --> 44:35.135
Oh.

44:35.137 --> 44:36.403
I guess I was wondering

44:36.405 --> 44:38.238
if you knew anything
about her family

44:38.240 --> 44:41.075
or where she's from.

44:41.077 --> 44:43.311
How would I know about that?

44:43.313 --> 44:46.447
I try to keep out
of people's personal lives.

44:46.449 --> 44:49.117
I just assumed
she bought her house from you.

44:49.119 --> 44:51.318
No, I rep the seller,
not the buyer.

44:52.922 --> 44:54.287
She paid cash,

44:54.289 --> 44:57.326
which in my books means
she's not to be trusted.

44:58.927 --> 44:59.862
Why?

45:01.331 --> 45:04.097
There are only two kinds
of people who pay cash.

45:04.099 --> 45:05.967
Rich people investing,

45:05.969 --> 45:08.336
and criminals
who don't want a paper trail.

45:08.338 --> 45:10.338
Look at her car.

45:10.340 --> 45:12.342
I think she's in the latter.

45:26.523 --> 45:29.055
Hey.

45:29.057 --> 45:32.293
Is everything okay? I thought
you'd be outside again.

45:32.295 --> 45:34.364
Mom says
you just stayed in all day.

45:35.364 --> 45:37.999
Didn't sleep well last night.

45:38.001 --> 45:40.971
Well, I hope you didn't spend
all day staring out the window.

45:44.574 --> 45:46.976
Okay. Seriously,
enough is enough.

45:48.478 --> 45:51.244
Mom is right, you're obsessed
with the neighbors.

45:51.246 --> 45:53.347
I just think Sandy next door
is a little odd.

45:53.349 --> 45:55.016
Sandy? I thought
she was your friend.

45:55.018 --> 45:56.516
She was staring at me
really weird last night.

45:56.518 --> 45:59.186
Oh, come on, Rachel.
They all can't be crazy.

45:59.188 --> 46:02.023
I worry. Okay?

46:02.025 --> 46:04.992
I'm in this strange place,
stuck at home all day.

46:04.994 --> 46:07.427
I see things, and I worry.

46:07.429 --> 46:10.099
Yeah, well,
I'm starting to worry, too.

46:11.467 --> 46:13.070
You know what? I'll just...

46:14.403 --> 46:15.536
get out of your hair.

46:21.077 --> 46:22.242
Mother, please.

46:22.244 --> 46:23.411
She can't
handle this.

46:23.413 --> 46:25.012
It's hard enough
already.

46:25.014 --> 46:26.347
No, it's only
gonna get harder.

46:26.349 --> 46:27.548
Would you
just keep your voice...

46:27.550 --> 46:30.150
No, I, wha... Listen.

46:30.152 --> 46:32.552
You two have to figure out
how this is going to work.

46:32.554 --> 46:34.421
- And we will, but...
- Tsk.

46:34.423 --> 46:36.624
You can't butt your head
into everything.

46:36.626 --> 46:38.626
I had no idea
you felt this way, okay?

46:38.628 --> 46:40.528
- No, I don't mean to...
- Would it be better...

46:40.530 --> 46:42.533
No. Mother...

46:59.581 --> 47:01.317
Oh, my God.

47:17.333 --> 47:18.365
Honey.

47:18.367 --> 47:20.333
Shut the door. Shut the door.

47:20.335 --> 47:21.534
What's wrong?

47:21.536 --> 47:23.637
I saw something.

47:23.639 --> 47:25.206
Not this again.

47:25.208 --> 47:26.641
I'm literally coming up
to say sorry.

47:26.643 --> 47:30.211
I'm serious. Sandy has a poster.
She has our poster.

47:30.213 --> 47:32.079
What are you talking about?
A poster?

47:32.081 --> 47:33.613
The <i>Alice In Wonderland</i> poster
that we have in the nursery.

47:33.615 --> 47:35.115
She has an exact copy.

47:35.117 --> 47:36.483
- That's insane.
- I know.

47:36.485 --> 47:39.552
No. What you're saying
is insane.

47:39.554 --> 47:42.088
So she likes your poster,
so what?

47:42.090 --> 47:43.356
So what?

47:43.358 --> 47:45.159
It's not something normal.

47:45.161 --> 47:47.228
Peter, it's not normal.
It's not safe up here.

47:47.230 --> 47:49.229
We've to get out of here. We've,
we've to get out of here.

47:49.231 --> 47:50.530
Honey, you're overreacting,
okay?

47:50.532 --> 47:52.266
You're finding trouble
where there isn't any.

47:52.268 --> 47:54.267
You need to relax.

47:54.269 --> 47:57.273
Our daughter
needs you to relax, okay?

48:00.643 --> 48:02.411
You don't believe me.

48:05.114 --> 48:07.117
You want me to look?

48:14.356 --> 48:17.258
I-I don't even know
what I'm looking for.

48:17.260 --> 48:19.229
I think you're having
a nervous breakdown.

48:20.195 --> 48:21.662
I should call the doctor.

48:21.664 --> 48:23.667
You should call the police.

48:24.701 --> 48:26.269
No.

48:28.137 --> 48:29.640
- No?
- No.

48:31.173 --> 48:32.572
Fine.

48:32.574 --> 48:34.407
I'll call the police.

48:34.409 --> 48:36.409
Please. Please.

48:36.411 --> 48:39.415
Honey, you need to stop this.

48:44.519 --> 48:46.523
I'm calling the doctor.

49:10.313 --> 49:11.445
The doctor said
it's perfectly safe

49:11.447 --> 49:13.213
to take these with the baby.

49:13.215 --> 49:15.217
It'll help you calm down.

49:18.588 --> 49:20.958
If you need anything,
just call me, okay?

50:20.817 --> 50:22.719
I'm sorry.

50:24.753 --> 50:27.387
I didn't mean to scare you.

50:27.389 --> 50:28.856
You just startled me, is all.

50:28.858 --> 50:30.858
I hadn't seen you back here.

50:30.860 --> 50:33.394
I was getting worried.

50:33.396 --> 50:35.396
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

50:35.398 --> 50:36.764
Yeah.

50:36.766 --> 50:38.668
Are you <i>sure?</i>

50:40.503 --> 50:43.436
Because
I went shopping.

50:43.438 --> 50:45.405
I thought you might be
craving ice cream.

50:45.407 --> 50:47.476
Cliché, I know, but...

50:48.443 --> 50:50.878
I got you...

50:50.880 --> 50:53.280
strawberry...

50:53.282 --> 50:54.418
and...

50:55.550 --> 50:56.684
chocolate.

50:56.686 --> 50:58.688
Because nobody likes vanilla.

51:00.523 --> 51:01.856
Thanks.

51:01.858 --> 51:04.657
Guess it's a little cold
for ice cream today.

51:04.659 --> 51:06.526
Should I put it in the freezer?

51:06.528 --> 51:08.297
That'd be great.

51:30.820 --> 51:32.485
It's in the freezer
whenever you want it.

51:32.487 --> 51:34.423
I really appreciate it.

51:44.333 --> 51:48.338
And now, we can prove
that I am not crazy.

51:51.873 --> 51:54.543
Okay. Quick like a bunny.
Quickly.

51:57.579 --> 52:00.347
Come on, come on, come on.

52:01.550 --> 52:03.686
Come on.

52:18.534 --> 52:20.903
Sometimes it's good
to be ostracized.

53:46.956 --> 53:48.592
Oh, my God.

54:19.487 --> 54:20.756
What?

54:59.795 --> 55:01.795
I swear I had the key
when I left.

55:03.065 --> 55:05.068
Did I leave the door unlocked?

55:26.722 --> 55:27.990
Hello?

55:33.061 --> 55:34.961
Hey!

55:34.963 --> 55:36.865
Found your keys.

55:54.115 --> 55:56.983
Oh, my God.

55:56.985 --> 56:00.586
- Ah!
- How did this happen?

56:00.588 --> 56:02.858
I'm not sure.
Just a klutz, I guess.

56:07.596 --> 56:09.729
- I'm calling the doctor.
- No.

56:09.731 --> 56:13.066
No, I'm fine. Promise.

56:13.068 --> 56:16.606
- We shouldn't take any chances.
- We're not taking any chances.

56:18.039 --> 56:20.610
Patricia, you have to trust me.

56:22.143 --> 56:23.912
All right.

56:25.648 --> 56:26.916
Thank you.

56:29.617 --> 56:30.652
Ow!

56:33.155 --> 56:36.055
Well, you took quite a spill,
but the baby's fine.

56:36.057 --> 56:37.657
Oh, thank God.

56:37.659 --> 56:39.025
Let's get that knee covered up.

56:39.027 --> 56:40.159
Thank you so much, Doctor.

56:40.161 --> 56:41.994
I was very concerned.

56:41.996 --> 56:46.166
Your blood pressure
is still high, it's concerning.

56:46.168 --> 56:48.901
Have you been
taking it easy at home?

56:48.903 --> 56:53.173
Yeah, I jus...
I just worry a lot, I guess.

56:53.175 --> 56:55.742
You're under a tremendous
amount of stress,

56:55.744 --> 56:58.878
and your body is acting in ways
it's never acted before.

56:58.880 --> 57:01.748
And a lot of time sitting around
gives you a lot of time

57:01.750 --> 57:03.684
for worrying.

57:03.686 --> 57:04.918
Try not to fixate.

57:04.920 --> 57:09.188
Your job right now
is to rest, rest, rest.

57:09.190 --> 57:11.825
Um, just a quick
question, Doctor.

57:11.827 --> 57:14.927
Um, do, uh...

57:14.929 --> 57:18.130
do pregnant women
ever see things?

57:18.132 --> 57:20.436
- Like what?
- Well, um...

57:22.003 --> 57:25.771
Do they have, uh,
unnatural anxieties?

57:25.773 --> 57:27.708
That sort of thing.

57:27.710 --> 57:30.142
Well, it's, uh,
it's rare,

57:30.144 --> 57:32.713
but, uh, some women
do experience

57:32.715 --> 57:34.280
acute onset panic disorder.

57:34.282 --> 57:36.249
Is there something
I need to be aware of?

57:36.251 --> 57:39.052
No, no. I'm sure it's nothing.

57:39.054 --> 57:41.921
Well, if, uh, if you do find
yourself concerned,

57:41.923 --> 57:43.789
please don't hesitate to call.

57:43.791 --> 57:45.291
Mothers with extreme anxieties

57:45.293 --> 57:48.931
can be harmful to themselves,
and their babies.

58:01.976 --> 58:05.181
It must be hard living
with a pregnant woman.

58:06.849 --> 58:08.115
Well, it's been hard for you,

58:08.117 --> 58:09.316
it's been hard for all of us.

58:09.318 --> 58:12.719
But, we're in this
together, right?

58:12.721 --> 58:14.724
We sure are.

58:16.257 --> 58:17.990
Any chance you could
give me a foot rub?

58:17.992 --> 58:19.126
Of course.

58:19.128 --> 58:20.927
Let me just set my alarm
before I forget.

58:20.929 --> 58:22.795
<i>Authorities
and clean up crews</i>

58:22.797 --> 58:24.130
<i>are already on the scene.</i>

58:24.132 --> 58:25.898
<i>And in breaking news,
state and local</i>

58:25.900 --> 58:27.767
<i>law enforcement agencies
are on high alert</i>

58:27.769 --> 58:29.269
<i>following the stunning
daytime abduction</i>

58:29.271 --> 58:31.003
<i>of a six-month-old girl.</i>

58:31.005 --> 58:32.271
<i>If you have any information</i>

58:32.273 --> 58:34.007
<i>or have seen anything
suspicious,</i>

58:34.009 --> 58:37.344
<i>please, the family is
pleading with you.</i>

58:37.346 --> 58:38.912
Okay, how about no more of that?

58:38.914 --> 58:40.280
Agreed.

58:40.282 --> 58:42.349
This is all about relaxing.

58:42.351 --> 58:44.119
Mm-hm.

58:46.155 --> 58:47.954
Oh!

58:47.956 --> 58:49.289
Mm-hmm?

58:49.291 --> 58:51.294
Oh, this is amazing.

59:11.213 --> 59:12.849
- No.
- What?

59:14.849 --> 59:16.182
- It can't be.
- What's wrong?

59:16.184 --> 59:17.784
- Ow!
- Honey!

59:17.786 --> 59:19.151
Honey!

59:19.153 --> 59:21.954
- She has a baby.
- What? What baby?

59:21.956 --> 59:23.889
See for yourself.

59:23.891 --> 59:25.928
What are you talking about?

59:32.900 --> 59:35.168
Rachel, you're scaring me.

59:35.170 --> 59:36.802
Seriously,
something is wrong here.

59:36.804 --> 59:38.070
Peter, I saw it. She has a baby.

59:38.072 --> 59:39.840
You heard the radio.
There's a baby missing.

59:39.842 --> 59:41.842
- I bet you it was Sandy.
- Rachel, calm down.

59:41.844 --> 59:43.342
Why won't anyone believe me?
She has a baby.

59:43.344 --> 59:44.811
She probably wants our baby too.

59:44.813 --> 59:45.945
Honey, please.

59:45.947 --> 59:48.048
Why won't anyone listen to me?

01:00:13.375 --> 01:00:16.842
And what was it
that got her so upset?

01:00:16.844 --> 01:00:18.445
I don't know,
she kept yelling something

01:00:18.447 --> 01:00:20.012
about the neighbor
having a baby.

01:00:20.014 --> 01:00:21.981
She had a baby.

01:00:21.983 --> 01:00:25.851
She said she couldn't
have any kids.

01:00:25.853 --> 01:00:28.021
And that kidnapping...

01:00:28.023 --> 01:00:29.322
Is she okay?

01:00:29.324 --> 01:00:32.295
She'll be fine.
Just a bit dazed.

01:00:41.469 --> 01:00:43.302
You have to
believe me.

01:00:43.304 --> 01:00:45.307
She was cradling a baby.

01:00:50.012 --> 01:00:52.079
She had my nursery.

01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:53.380
She has your nursery?

01:00:53.382 --> 01:00:55.949
I saw.

01:00:55.951 --> 01:00:59.318
I thought I saw a nursery
in her house...

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.656
just like mine.

01:01:01.889 --> 01:01:03.259
Wait. How did you see it?

01:01:06.961 --> 01:01:08.364
I just came from
talking to the neighbor.

01:01:09.931 --> 01:01:11.933
Have you been inside her house?

01:01:14.369 --> 01:01:16.168
Well, fortunately, your
neighbor's not interested

01:01:16.170 --> 01:01:17.204
in pressing charges.

01:01:17.206 --> 01:01:19.005
Pressing charges?

01:01:19.007 --> 01:01:21.307
- What are you talking about?
- Harassment.

01:01:21.309 --> 01:01:23.376
From what I've been told,
she's...

01:01:23.378 --> 01:01:25.045
she's been keeping a close eye
on the neighbors,

01:01:25.047 --> 01:01:27.414
and it's making people uneasy.

01:01:27.416 --> 01:01:30.182
She said... She said
she couldn't get pregnant.

01:01:30.184 --> 01:01:32.052
But... I saw a picture.

01:01:32.054 --> 01:01:34.354
I saw, in it, she was,
she was pregnant.

01:01:34.356 --> 01:01:36.322
- Do you ever give up?
- Mother...

01:01:36.324 --> 01:01:40.994
No. These officers are
too polite to say it but I will.

01:01:40.996 --> 01:01:42.996
You're acting crazy.

01:01:42.998 --> 01:01:44.463
Are you gonna
let her do this?

01:01:44.465 --> 01:01:46.066
Honey, no one is doing anything.

01:01:46.068 --> 01:01:47.967
No, but we will, if necessary.

01:01:47.969 --> 01:01:50.070
Look,
it's been a rough evening.

01:01:50.072 --> 01:01:52.972
Let's all just calm down.
No one was hurt.

01:01:52.974 --> 01:01:54.340
Um, I just have a few
more questions.

01:01:54.342 --> 01:01:56.978
- Maybe we can talk downstairs.
- Sure.

01:01:58.213 --> 01:01:59.481
Ma'am.

01:02:17.965 --> 01:02:21.267
You probably think
I'm crazy too.

01:02:21.269 --> 01:02:24.503
Sometimes... when we can't run,

01:02:24.505 --> 01:02:27.375
things can feel more dangerous
than they actually are.

01:02:30.978 --> 01:02:33.546
Just in case...

01:02:33.548 --> 01:02:36.416
the next time you see something,

01:02:36.418 --> 01:02:38.985
you call me first.

01:02:38.987 --> 01:02:40.255
Okay?

01:02:44.458 --> 01:02:46.094
Thank you.

01:02:56.271 --> 01:02:58.438
You can't say those
kinds of things, Mom.

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.173
Somebody has to.

01:03:00.175 --> 01:03:02.008
Well, you didn't
have to say it right there.

01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:04.276
Did you know that she
has a history of mental illness?

01:03:04.278 --> 01:03:06.378
Or was she waiting to have

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:08.048
that discussion
until after the wedding?

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:09.282
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:03:09.284 --> 01:03:10.450
Sandy...

01:03:10.452 --> 01:03:12.485
the neighbor she's
been harassing

01:03:12.487 --> 01:03:16.055
told me that Rachel
has been on medication, Peter.

01:03:16.057 --> 01:03:18.157
Now, maybe she's off it now
because of the baby,

01:03:18.159 --> 01:03:20.226
but that might be
part of the reason

01:03:20.228 --> 01:03:22.461
why she is acting so odd.

01:03:22.463 --> 01:03:24.363
There is a child's life
at stake.

01:03:24.365 --> 01:03:27.032
And how the hell would
Sandy know that?

01:03:27.034 --> 01:03:29.038
How would Sandy know that?

01:03:42.217 --> 01:03:44.483
Good morning, Rachel.

01:03:44.485 --> 01:03:46.388
You have a visitor.

01:03:52.126 --> 01:03:53.262
What are you doing here?

01:03:54.496 --> 01:03:56.229
I thought it would be good
for both of you

01:03:56.231 --> 01:03:57.834
to clear the air.

01:04:00.534 --> 01:04:02.170
- Thank you.
- Mm.

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.141
Good morning.

01:04:08.143 --> 01:04:10.644
I just wanted
to let you know that...

01:04:10.646 --> 01:04:13.282
there are no hard feelings.

01:04:18.619 --> 01:04:21.223
This is certainly gonna
make it harder to wave hello.

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:23.555
I'm very sorry.

01:04:23.557 --> 01:04:25.561
I don't know
what I was thinking.

01:04:27.429 --> 01:04:29.432
I hope you like pie.

01:04:31.233 --> 01:04:33.202
I figured you needed
something sweet this morning.

01:04:37.505 --> 01:04:39.507
I made it just for you.

01:04:44.512 --> 01:04:46.412
Mm.

01:04:46.414 --> 01:04:48.250
I knew you'd like it.

01:04:50.686 --> 01:04:54.320
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:04:54.322 --> 01:04:57.356
I don't want to be a bother,
so I'm gonna get going.

01:04:57.358 --> 01:04:59.592
After last night...

01:04:59.594 --> 01:05:01.329
I'm sure you need your rest.

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:07.436
Bye.

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.710
Rachel? Dear?

01:05:56.318 --> 01:05:58.717
What's all that noise?
Did you hurt yourself?

01:05:58.719 --> 01:06:01.454
Nope. All good.

01:06:01.456 --> 01:06:05.492
Okay. Um, well,
do you need anything?

01:06:05.494 --> 01:06:08.595
- I'm fine. Thank you.
- Okay.

01:06:08.597 --> 01:06:10.496
Well, if you change your mind,

01:06:10.498 --> 01:06:13.333
remember you still have
that bell.

01:06:13.335 --> 01:06:14.603
Hm.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.459
He's home early.

01:06:40.461 --> 01:06:42.561
- <i>Hello.</i>
- <i>How are ya?</i>

01:06:42.563 --> 01:06:44.630
- <i>I'm good, thank you.</i>
- <i>Good.</i>

01:06:44.632 --> 01:06:47.035
<i>How's everything going?</i>

01:06:48.503 --> 01:06:50.271
<i>We're going back to marriage.</i>

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:03.519
- <i>Duty calls.</i>
- <i>Right.</i>

01:07:16.797 --> 01:07:18.566
Hello.

01:07:20.501 --> 01:07:21.867
How was your day?

01:07:21.869 --> 01:07:25.338
I'm in solitary confinement.
How was your day?

01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:27.574
I put someone
in solitary confinement.

01:07:27.576 --> 01:07:29.711
So, I guess that makes us even?

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:34.613
Can you help me out of bed?
I need to get up a little bit.

01:07:34.615 --> 01:07:36.085
Of course.

01:07:37.885 --> 01:07:39.552
May I have this dance?

01:07:39.554 --> 01:07:42.421
Oh, come on, Peter. I'm hideous.

01:07:42.423 --> 01:07:43.822
No, you look perfect.

01:07:43.824 --> 01:07:46.825
I promise it won't always
be this bad.

01:07:46.827 --> 01:07:49.295
Can't get any worse.

01:07:49.297 --> 01:07:52.565
Well, once the baby is here...

01:07:52.567 --> 01:07:56.469
once we get rid of my mom,
not permanently.

01:07:56.471 --> 01:07:58.438
That's a lot of things
that need to happen

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.706
before we get back
to where we were.

01:08:00.708 --> 01:08:02.675
Once we're done dealing
with the pregnancy,

01:08:02.677 --> 01:08:05.778
we're gonna be dealing
with an infant,

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:09.849
then a toddler and then school,
and then college,

01:08:09.851 --> 01:08:12.621
and then we're just
back to us...

01:08:15.556 --> 01:08:17.559
which wasn't perfect
to begin with.

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:20.593
What are you saying?

01:08:20.595 --> 01:08:23.629
Why are you even still with me?

01:08:23.631 --> 01:08:25.631
What are you talking about?

01:08:25.634 --> 01:08:27.466
I heard you and your mother
last night.

01:08:27.469 --> 01:08:28.867
I know what you're planning.

01:08:28.868 --> 01:08:30.903
- We're not planning anything.
- I'm not gonna let you.

01:08:30.904 --> 01:08:33.772
- Let me what?
- Take the baby.

01:08:33.774 --> 01:08:36.442
Rachel, my mother isn't
taking the baby.

01:08:36.444 --> 01:08:38.678
The neighbor isn't taking the
baby. Nobody is taking the baby.

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:42.648
You bet your ass
no one's taking the baby.

01:08:42.649 --> 01:08:44.819
You know what?
I'm gonna sleep downstairs.

01:09:39.939 --> 01:09:41.577
Peter?

01:09:46.981 --> 01:09:48.649
Patricia?

01:09:55.823 --> 01:09:57.458
Patricia?

01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:04.200
Everything okay, dear?

01:10:04.798 --> 01:10:06.435
You seem upset.

01:10:07.969 --> 01:10:10.436
What are you doing here?

01:10:10.438 --> 01:10:12.938
I came to see
how you were doing.

01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:14.710
And the baby, of course.

01:10:15.777 --> 01:10:16.878
Where's Patricia?

01:10:17.746 --> 01:10:19.879
She's downstairs.

01:10:19.881 --> 01:10:22.885
I think she's a little
fed up with you.

01:10:28.789 --> 01:10:30.559
What's this?

01:10:40.635 --> 01:10:42.905
Spying on me
with a baby monitor?

01:10:47.876 --> 01:10:49.878
That's going a little far,
don't you think?

01:10:54.682 --> 01:10:56.585
But I won't tell.

01:10:57.819 --> 01:10:59.785
I mean...

01:10:59.787 --> 01:11:01.754
Patricia's really just waiting
to call you

01:11:01.756 --> 01:11:03.626
an unfit mother, isn't she?

01:11:05.627 --> 01:11:07.660
Mm.

01:11:07.662 --> 01:11:11.063
You're really not taking
good care of yourself.

01:11:11.065 --> 01:11:12.835
Look at you.

01:11:15.103 --> 01:11:16.739
You're a mess.

01:11:17.771 --> 01:11:19.908
Oh, all the hormones.

01:11:20.742 --> 01:11:22.011
No meds.

01:11:24.045 --> 01:11:25.814
Are you crazy?

01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:28.617
Not crazy?

01:11:32.087 --> 01:11:34.590
I'm here to take care
of you now.

01:11:35.856 --> 01:11:37.893
You're gonna be a mommy soon.

01:11:40.795 --> 01:11:42.931
I'm gonna go downstairs
and clean something up.

01:11:43.965 --> 01:11:45.868
Now, don't you go anywhere.

01:11:47.135 --> 01:11:49.038
Not that you could, anyway.

01:11:55.909 --> 01:11:57.943
Here.

01:11:57.945 --> 01:12:00.045
Put that on.

01:12:00.047 --> 01:12:02.647
We're gonna go outside and...

01:12:02.649 --> 01:12:04.786
I don't want
the baby to catch a cold.

01:12:22.871 --> 01:12:26.641
Think, dammit, think.

01:12:33.113 --> 01:12:34.682
Where are you? Where are you?

01:12:41.122 --> 01:12:43.025
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

01:12:48.029 --> 01:12:49.594
<i>Hello.</i>

01:12:49.596 --> 01:12:50.963
<i>You've reached
Officer Diane Lee.</i>

01:12:50.965 --> 01:12:52.665
<i>Please leave me a message
after the tone</i>

01:12:52.667 --> 01:12:54.599
<i>and I'll respond
as soon as possible.</i>

01:12:54.601 --> 01:12:56.803
<i>If this is an emergency,
dial 911.</i>

01:12:56.805 --> 01:12:58.970
Officer Lee, this is Rachel,
the crazy pregnant lady.

01:12:58.972 --> 01:13:01.107
You told me to call you.
I'm, I'm trapped in my house.

01:13:01.109 --> 01:13:03.612
- Sandy, my neighbor's...
- What are you doing?

01:13:05.747 --> 01:13:08.815
Funny thing about
these new monitors...

01:13:08.817 --> 01:13:11.420
you can watch the video feed
from anywhere,

01:13:12.753 --> 01:13:14.622
even your neighbor's house.

01:13:18.059 --> 01:13:20.058
- Downstairs.
- Okay.

01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:22.163
- Now.
- Okay.

01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:35.143
Patricia's not
feeling so well.

01:13:36.176 --> 01:13:37.779
What did you do to her?

01:13:39.146 --> 01:13:42.180
Your motherly instincts
are quite good, you know?

01:13:42.182 --> 01:13:45.151
Yvonne, the nanny...

01:13:45.153 --> 01:13:47.155
neither one of them
cared for that child.

01:13:48.189 --> 01:13:49.925
But I would have.

01:13:51.993 --> 01:13:54.660
You killed the nanny.

01:13:54.662 --> 01:13:57.729
No, I told you, she ran away.

01:13:57.731 --> 01:14:01.032
Which is a shame, because
she was terrible at her job.

01:14:01.034 --> 01:14:04.672
Always on the phone at the park,
never paying attention.

01:14:06.073 --> 01:14:08.941
I could have given
that baby a good home.

01:14:08.943 --> 01:14:10.675
I could have had that baby.

01:14:10.677 --> 01:14:12.480
They certainly didn't want it.

01:14:13.814 --> 01:14:17.884
But you had to
go play nosey neighbor,

01:14:17.886 --> 01:14:19.951
and mess it all up.

01:14:19.953 --> 01:14:23.222
But, but you already
have a baby. I saw you.

01:14:23.224 --> 01:14:27.125
Yes, but I should have
had twins.

01:14:27.127 --> 01:14:29.130
Because of you...

01:14:30.864 --> 01:14:33.034
I still need one more.

01:14:55.256 --> 01:14:58.126
Just act like
everything is normal.

01:15:11.972 --> 01:15:14.009
Smile to your friendly neighbor.

01:15:22.015 --> 01:15:24.286
You've made this way
too easy for me.

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:44.873
It sounds like someone's crying
for their mommy.

01:15:48.176 --> 01:15:50.241
Where are you going?

01:15:50.243 --> 01:15:52.079
The nursery.

01:15:55.783 --> 01:15:59.184
I had to move the nursery
once you found it.

01:15:59.186 --> 01:16:01.189
In case the cops came looking.

01:16:03.992 --> 01:16:05.260
Downstairs.

01:16:16.970 --> 01:16:18.239
Go on.

01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:20.976
Open it.

01:17:10.992 --> 01:17:12.994
Don't you just love that poster?

01:17:23.104 --> 01:17:25.103
You lost your baby?

01:17:25.105 --> 01:17:26.140
Babies.

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:29.407
Twins.

01:17:29.409 --> 01:17:30.679
My little girls.

01:17:33.014 --> 01:17:34.280
He left me, you know?

01:17:34.282 --> 01:17:36.083
He said it was my fault.

01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:38.987
But now...

01:17:40.054 --> 01:17:41.422
Now I can go back to him.

01:17:42.989 --> 01:17:44.992
And we can all
be together again.

01:17:46.426 --> 01:17:48.429
My happy little family.

01:17:52.033 --> 01:17:54.266
I, uh...

01:17:54.268 --> 01:17:57.204
I know how much you wanted
to have a baby, but...

01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:01.240
But what?

01:18:01.242 --> 01:18:03.278
But you can't have mine.

01:18:08.048 --> 01:18:10.452
Shh, shh, shh.

01:18:11.351 --> 01:18:13.020
It's okay.

01:18:18.059 --> 01:18:19.458
Rachel!

01:18:26.134 --> 01:18:27.165
It's okay.

01:18:27.167 --> 01:18:29.070
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay

01:18:36.944 --> 01:18:38.143
Come on.

01:18:38.145 --> 01:18:39.477
Come on.

01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:43.451
Rachel!

01:18:45.118 --> 01:18:46.387
My water just broke.

01:18:47.387 --> 01:18:49.088
Ah!

01:18:49.090 --> 01:18:51.423
I don't know
what you're so afraid of.

01:18:51.425 --> 01:18:53.459
You said it yourself...

01:18:53.461 --> 01:18:55.326
I'd be a great mom.

01:19:03.171 --> 01:19:04.536
Help!

01:19:04.538 --> 01:19:07.039
Someone help me!

01:19:07.041 --> 01:19:08.307
Oh, honey.

01:19:08.309 --> 01:19:10.509
Let's get this baby out of you.

01:19:18.418 --> 01:19:19.985
You don't look so good.

01:19:19.987 --> 01:19:23.388
Plea...

01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:25.290
Please don't hurt my baby.

01:19:25.292 --> 01:19:28.027
Your baby is gonna be just fine.

01:19:28.029 --> 01:19:30.196
But I'm afraid mommy might not
survive the procedure.

01:19:35.269 --> 01:19:39.405
Now, generally C-sections
require anesthesia.

01:19:39.407 --> 01:19:42.273
But in emergency cases
like this...

01:19:42.275 --> 01:19:44.179
I just had to save the baby.

01:19:49.483 --> 01:19:53.552
This is Officer Lee. I need an
ambulance on site immediately.

01:19:53.554 --> 01:19:57.488
Suspect is down, pregnant woman
is injured and in active labor.

01:19:58.592 --> 01:20:00.291
I think, I think

01:20:00.293 --> 01:20:02.160
it's the baby from the news.

01:20:02.162 --> 01:20:04.263
Oh, my...

01:20:04.265 --> 01:20:07.299
You were right. You were right.

01:20:07.301 --> 01:20:09.602
You're gonna be okay.
Rachel, just hang in there.

01:20:09.604 --> 01:20:11.503
You're gonna be all right.

01:20:15.542 --> 01:20:17.343
I don't get you people.

01:20:17.345 --> 01:20:18.544
You have a nice house,

01:20:18.546 --> 01:20:20.178
a good husband,
and a baby on the way.

01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:22.147
All you do is complain,
complain, complain.

01:20:22.149 --> 01:20:25.084
Wh... Why? Why are you doing
this?

01:20:25.086 --> 01:20:27.152
You don't care about that baby.

01:20:27.154 --> 01:20:30.522
If you cared about her,
you would be at home in bed.

01:20:30.524 --> 01:20:33.157
I cared about my babies.

01:20:33.159 --> 01:20:35.460
My little girls.

01:20:35.462 --> 01:20:38.630
They were right there...

01:20:38.632 --> 01:20:41.165
and then they weren't.

01:20:41.167 --> 01:20:45.271
But now... now we're all gonna
be reunited again.

01:20:51.311 --> 01:20:54.082
You're gonna have this baby
whether you like it or not.

01:21:34.721 --> 01:21:37.156
Good to see you awake.

01:21:37.158 --> 01:21:39.657
And good to see you
doing so well.

01:21:39.659 --> 01:21:42.428
Both of you.

01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:45.129
You have a healthy baby girl.

01:21:45.131 --> 01:21:47.266
You are very lucky.

01:21:47.268 --> 01:21:49.537
- Can I hold her?
- Of course.

01:21:50.404 --> 01:21:52.303
Yeah.

01:21:52.305 --> 01:21:54.174
Look how sweet...

01:22:01.381 --> 01:22:04.383
From the family of
the little baby girl you found.

01:22:04.385 --> 01:22:06.384
They'd like to come in
and thank you, but I told them

01:22:06.386 --> 01:22:08.286
after you recover a little bit.

01:22:08.288 --> 01:22:09.655
Thank you.

01:22:09.657 --> 01:22:11.293
I'll let you two be.

01:22:17.731 --> 01:22:19.400
You're awake.

01:22:23.371 --> 01:22:25.637
I'm so sorry
I didn't trust you.

01:22:25.639 --> 01:22:27.539
Officer Lee told us everything.

01:22:27.541 --> 01:22:29.174
Is she okay?

01:22:29.176 --> 01:22:31.376
Healing, but, yeah, she's okay.

01:22:31.378 --> 01:22:32.646
Thanks to you.

01:22:38.586 --> 01:22:40.686
You were right about Sandy.

01:22:40.688 --> 01:22:42.190
About everything.

01:22:43.690 --> 01:22:46.191
You saved that little girl.

01:22:46.193 --> 01:22:47.462
And ours.

01:22:48.729 --> 01:22:50.265
I'm so sorry...

01:22:51.399 --> 01:22:52.667
about everything.

01:22:54.801 --> 01:22:57.204
Will you ever forgive me?

01:22:59.239 --> 01:23:00.507
Maybe.

01:23:02.643 --> 01:23:06.477
Well, don't forget
that I had a severe concussion.

01:23:06.479 --> 01:23:09.447
I believe the doctor said
it was a minor concussion,

01:23:09.449 --> 01:23:11.685
but I'm very glad
you're okay, Mom.

01:23:12.453 --> 01:23:14.553
Me too.

01:23:14.555 --> 01:23:16.487
Well, I'm-I'm just saying
that we were all

01:23:16.489 --> 01:23:19.424
affected by the situation.

01:23:19.426 --> 01:23:23.629
If you don't mind, Mom,
I think Rachel, Alice and I

01:23:23.631 --> 01:23:25.296
could use a little quiet time.

01:23:25.298 --> 01:23:27.402
Yeah, of course, um...

01:23:28.536 --> 01:23:29.671
It's, uh...

01:23:30.671 --> 01:23:32.737
grandma time, later.

01:23:32.739 --> 01:23:33.774
Definitely.

01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:37.479
Thank you, Mom.

01:23:43.516 --> 01:23:45.517
What'd I tell you?

01:23:45.519 --> 01:23:46.788
She's perfect.

01:23:49.722 --> 01:23:51.423
I hope you realize
we're selling the house

01:23:51.425 --> 01:23:52.558
and moving back to the city.

01:23:55.628 --> 01:23:57.631
Whatever my ladies want.
