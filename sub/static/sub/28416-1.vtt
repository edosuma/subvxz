WEBVTT

00:10.923 --> 00:13.491
[playful music]

00:36.819 --> 00:41.737
- Accommodate,
A-C-C-O-M-M-O-D-A-T-E,
Accommodate.

00:45.132 --> 00:47.917
- Wow, you nailed
it, Jumbo, correct.

00:47.960 --> 00:51.790
- I could've sworn there was
another A in there somewhere.

00:51.834 --> 00:56.969
Okay, smartytrunk,
try this one, rhythm.

00:57.535 --> 00:59.015
- Rhythm, hmm.

01:00.277 --> 01:04.586
R-H-Y-T-H-M, rhythm.

01:04.629 --> 01:06.153
- Right again.

01:06.196 --> 01:08.198
- Geez, that's some
kind of brain you have

01:08.242 --> 01:10.331
in that noggin of yours, Jumbo.

01:10.374 --> 01:12.594
Where on earth did
you learn those words?

01:12.637 --> 01:14.726
- Yeah, where'd
you even hear them?

01:14.770 --> 01:17.120
Jungle elephants
aren't exactly known

01:17.164 --> 01:19.209
for their verbose delivery.

01:19.253 --> 01:22.865
- True that, heck, nobody in
this jungle's really famous

01:22.908 --> 01:23.909
for their smarts.

01:23.953 --> 01:26.825
Cunning, yes, savagery, yes.

01:26.869 --> 01:30.916
But brainpower,
nah, not so much.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.832
- You're a real standout, buddy.

01:33.876 --> 01:35.443
- Oh, thanks a bunch you guys.

01:35.486 --> 01:38.881
It's true, folks around
here don't talk like that.

01:38.924 --> 01:41.971
So I didn't hear those
words anyplace, I read them.

01:42.014 --> 01:43.538
- You read 'em?
- You read 'em?

01:43.581 --> 01:45.148
- Yeah, I read them.

01:45.192 --> 01:46.932
I studied the dictionary.

01:46.976 --> 01:50.762
- The dictionary, that big
book with all the words?

01:50.806 --> 01:52.634
- That's the one, Weldon.

01:52.677 --> 01:54.418
I almost got the
whole thing memorized

01:54.462 --> 01:56.638
front to back,
and back to front.

01:56.681 --> 02:01.599
- Whoa, now that's
dedication, crazy dedication.

02:02.470 --> 02:03.688
- Nah, I just love learning.

02:03.732 --> 02:05.777
It's so fun to find new
and different facts,

02:05.821 --> 02:07.823
and stuff you never
knew about before.

02:07.866 --> 02:10.956
- Hmm, that does
sound kind of fun.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.958
- Oh, you'd be surprised.

02:13.002 --> 02:15.135
Tiny, tell you what, go ahead,

02:15.178 --> 02:17.398
throw me a word, any word.

02:17.441 --> 02:19.878
I'll spell what comes
after it in the dictionary.

02:19.922 --> 02:21.315
- What comes after it,

02:21.358 --> 02:23.795
you mean, one simple
word can connect

02:23.839 --> 02:25.841
your brain with the
words next to it?

02:25.884 --> 02:27.625
- Totally, Weldon.

02:27.669 --> 02:29.758
You'd be straight-up
surprised at the power

02:29.801 --> 02:32.195
we possess in these
little brains of ours.

02:32.239 --> 02:34.719
- Well, I mean look at you.

02:34.763 --> 02:38.245
You're an elephant,
your head's huge.

02:38.288 --> 02:39.811
- Gee, thanks buddy.

02:39.855 --> 02:42.988
- No, I mean the brain in
there has to be five times

02:43.032 --> 02:44.425
the size of mine.

02:44.468 --> 02:45.861
- 10 times.

02:45.904 --> 02:48.733
- Okay, let's not get
carried away, Tiny.

02:48.777 --> 02:51.432
My point is some animals
have a natural leg up

02:51.475 --> 02:53.912
at this sort of
thing, so to speak.

02:53.956 --> 02:55.044
- Or a wing up.

02:55.087 --> 02:57.786
- Or a wing up, but listen,

02:57.829 --> 03:00.658
you ever hear the
term birdbrain?

03:00.702 --> 03:02.443
They don't say that
about elephants.

03:02.486 --> 03:07.230
Nuh uh, they say, he's got
a memory like an elephant,

03:08.231 --> 03:10.668
because elephants are gigantic.

03:10.712 --> 03:13.367
And a bigger skull
means a bigger brain,

03:13.410 --> 03:16.892
and a bigger brain means
more ability to retain stuff

03:16.935 --> 03:19.764
and a higher capacity
to memorize and learn.

03:19.808 --> 03:21.505
- Memorizing and
learning are actually

03:21.549 --> 03:23.115
two different things, Weldon.

03:23.159 --> 03:25.030
Any monkey can memorize.

03:25.901 --> 03:27.076
- Semantics.

03:27.119 --> 03:29.731
Hey, there we go, semantics.

03:29.774 --> 03:33.561
Okay, hotshot, tell me the word
that comes after semantics.

03:33.604 --> 03:35.519
- And spell it, too.

03:35.563 --> 03:37.565
- Sure, it's semantogenic.

03:37.608 --> 03:38.783
- Uh, what?

03:38.827 --> 03:41.917
- Semantogenic, it means
rising from impairment

03:41.960 --> 03:43.527
in the use of language.

03:43.571 --> 03:45.137
- And?
- And,

03:45.181 --> 03:50.099
S-E-M-A-N-T-O-G-E-N-I-C,
semantogenic.

03:53.624 --> 03:57.106
- Unbelievable, he never misses.

03:57.149 --> 03:59.761
- As far as we know, we
don't have a dictionary

03:59.804 --> 04:00.631
in front of us.

04:00.675 --> 04:01.980
He could be fibbing,

04:02.024 --> 04:04.113
pulling our feathers, or tails.

04:04.156 --> 04:07.986
- Weldon, I think it's safe
to say Jumbo's never knowingly

04:08.030 --> 04:10.511
told a lie in his whole life.

04:10.554 --> 04:13.383
- His whole life, he's 62.

04:13.427 --> 04:17.126
- And he's the nicest,
friendliest, most honest

04:17.169 --> 04:20.564
and inquisitive animal
in our entire jungle.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.653
- Aw, thanks Tiny.

04:22.697 --> 04:26.222
- Eh, you're right, sorry Jumbo.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.877
You're a shoo-in to
win that spelling bee.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.140
I don't know why the
rest of us even try.

04:31.183 --> 04:33.142
You're the smartest
animal we know

04:33.185 --> 04:35.362
in this whole darned jungle.

04:35.405 --> 04:38.234
- Oh stop, and just
like any one of us,

04:38.278 --> 04:40.802
I can make mistakes,
I'm not perfect.

04:40.845 --> 04:43.587
I forget stuff
all the time, too.

04:43.631 --> 04:44.675
- You do?

04:44.719 --> 04:46.373
- Of course I do.

04:46.416 --> 04:49.811
Sometimes, if I'm tired,
or hungry, or irritated,

04:49.854 --> 04:51.943
I can mess up
spelling my own name.

04:51.987 --> 04:55.382
- Ha, even a birdbrain
can get that one.

04:55.425 --> 04:57.209
J-U-M-B-O, Jumbo.

05:04.391 --> 05:08.220
- Bert, do you have any idea
how many big-money endorsements

05:08.264 --> 05:10.048
you can land with
a sound victory

05:10.092 --> 05:13.487
in that silly jungle
spelling bee next week?

05:13.530 --> 05:15.750
- Silly, but the
jungle spelling bee's

05:15.793 --> 05:17.882
a big deal, Uncle Ron.

05:17.926 --> 05:21.799
Animals migrate from far and
wide just to take part in it.

05:21.843 --> 05:24.846
Heck, I've been studying
since I was a tadpole.

05:24.889 --> 05:27.239
- That's because
you're a Hollis, Bert,

05:27.283 --> 05:30.765
dedicated,
intelligent, ruthless.

05:30.808 --> 05:32.244
- And smart, too.

05:32.288 --> 05:35.813
- Smart doesn't pay
the bills, nephew.

05:35.857 --> 05:38.338
Aggression pays the bills.

05:39.643 --> 05:44.256
Ah, aggression, my
favorite word, go.

05:44.300 --> 05:49.261
- Aggression,
A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-O-N, aggression.

05:50.872 --> 05:53.918
- It sounds like a
cheerleader cheer.

05:53.962 --> 05:57.966
Every time I hear it, I
envision a squad of female frogs

05:58.009 --> 06:02.013
in H sweaters, shouting
and dancing in unison.

06:02.057 --> 06:03.841
Very good, Bert.

06:03.885 --> 06:07.584
True to your Hollis
lineage, you never fail.

06:07.628 --> 06:08.846
- Thanks, Uncle Ron.

06:08.890 --> 06:12.241
- Please, Bert,
call me Mr. Hollis.

06:12.284 --> 06:15.592
The spelling bee is coming
up fast and after you win,

06:15.636 --> 06:19.030
I'll be doing many
interviews on your behalf,

06:19.074 --> 06:23.078
about your skills, your
focus, your training,

06:23.121 --> 06:25.907
I don't want some silly
gazelle in the press corps

06:25.950 --> 06:29.519
to shout out, Ronny, over here.

06:29.563 --> 06:31.869
- Gotcha, will do, Mr. Hollis.

06:31.913 --> 06:35.525
- Remember, authority
projects success, Bert,

06:35.569 --> 06:38.702
and success begets authority.

06:38.746 --> 06:41.749
Pick a word, go.

06:41.792 --> 06:44.708
- Go, G-O, go.

06:44.752 --> 06:47.755
- Bert, a bigger word, please,

06:47.798 --> 06:50.888
something a bit more convoluted.

06:50.932 --> 06:53.108
- Yes, Mr. Hollis, convoluted,

06:53.151 --> 06:58.069
C-O-N-V-O-L-U-T-E-D, convoluted.

06:59.331 --> 07:01.682
- Excellent, nine-tenths
of animals out there

07:01.725 --> 07:02.944
would flub that one.

07:02.987 --> 07:04.902
You're a lock to
win it all, nephew,

07:04.946 --> 07:07.252
a legend in the making.

07:07.296 --> 07:09.429
Come now to my den.

07:09.472 --> 07:11.561
We'll run flashcards
until sundown,

07:11.605 --> 07:13.955
then you'll hydrate and rest.

07:13.998 --> 07:17.480
- I got it under control
Unc-, I mean, Mr. Hollis.

07:17.524 --> 07:18.786
Have you gotten a
load of the animals

07:18.829 --> 07:21.049
that will competing
in that contest?

07:21.092 --> 07:23.007
They're real dum-dums.

07:23.051 --> 07:25.575
Like you said,
I'm a lock to win.

07:25.619 --> 07:27.795
I'm a Hollis, I can't lose.

07:27.838 --> 07:30.667
- Careful nephew, careful.

07:30.711 --> 07:32.364
Confidence is an
asset, for sure,

07:33.540 --> 07:36.543
but arrogance can
easily work against us.

07:36.586 --> 07:38.414
- Arrogance, schmarrogance.

07:38.458 --> 07:43.419
S-C-H-M-A-R-R-O-G-A-N-C-E,
schmarrogance [laughs].

07:47.902 --> 07:51.993
- You remind me so much of
myself as a younger frog, Bert.

07:52.036 --> 07:53.255
- Thanks, Mr. Hollis.

07:53.298 --> 07:55.736
And to tell you the
truth, I've always felt

07:55.779 --> 07:57.825
more kinship with
you than with Pops.

07:57.868 --> 08:01.916
- Well, I don't know where your
father came from, honestly.

08:01.959 --> 08:03.874
He must've been adopted.

08:03.918 --> 08:06.573
He certainly exhibits
none of the traits

08:06.616 --> 08:09.358
of winning that you
and I possess, Bert.

08:09.401 --> 08:13.275
- Pops is a loser,
L-O-S-E-R, loser.

08:13.318 --> 08:17.584
He spends all day plucking
flies from his old lily pad.

08:17.627 --> 08:19.716
And have you seen
that thing lately?

08:19.760 --> 08:21.892
He hasn't washed it in years.

08:21.936 --> 08:25.722
- Yes, well, hygiene was
never his strong suit.

08:25.766 --> 08:29.073
As tadpoles, we used
to forage wild spinach

08:29.117 --> 08:31.902
on the lake banks, but
your father would wait

08:31.946 --> 08:34.426
outside the pet store
dumpster for the staff

08:34.470 --> 08:37.647
to discard their
expired fish flakes.

08:37.691 --> 08:38.909
- Oh no!

08:38.953 --> 08:41.912
- I'm afraid so, we'd
all stuff our bellies

08:41.956 --> 08:44.741
full of organic goodies,
and there your dad would be,

08:44.785 --> 08:46.613
hunkered down all
day in an alley,

08:47.875 --> 08:51.356
munching on stale,
smelly shrimp flakes.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.229
- Oh gag, I think
I'm gonna be sick.

08:54.272 --> 08:57.188
- It's of no
consequence now, Bert.

08:57.232 --> 09:02.150
- C-O-N-S-E-Q-U-E-N-C-E,
consequence.

09:03.064 --> 09:07.024
- Yes, yes, yes! [evil laughs]

09:11.812 --> 09:13.814
[upbeat music]

09:13.857 --> 09:17.426
- Wow, get a load of all the
great species-specific snacks

09:17.469 --> 09:20.168
being offered at our
jungle fair this year.

09:20.211 --> 09:22.692
It's absolutely
out of this world.

09:22.736 --> 09:25.956
- I know, right, yum.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.874
There's sprouts, jerky, grains,
fruits, and falafel, too.

09:30.918 --> 09:33.529
- I haven't tried
falafel, is it good?

09:33.573 --> 09:36.663
- Oh, it's the
bee's knees, Weldon.

09:36.706 --> 09:38.273
- Bee's knees, yuck.

09:39.274 --> 09:41.537
- It's just a figure of speech.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.191
It means, good.

09:43.234 --> 09:44.801
- The best.

09:44.845 --> 09:47.935
- The best would be
some fresh worms.

09:47.978 --> 09:50.981
But I don't see a single
annelid, nematode,

09:51.025 --> 09:51.765
platyhelminth,
nemertean, chaetognatha,

09:54.376 --> 09:56.465
or priapulid anywhere.

09:56.508 --> 09:59.773
- Wow, who said you were
birdbrained, Weldon?

09:59.816 --> 10:01.644
I don't know that I
could spell a single one

10:01.688 --> 10:02.819
of those big words.

10:02.863 --> 10:04.952
- And I definitely couldn't.

10:04.995 --> 10:07.781
- Oh, neither could I, I
just know 'em by heart,

10:07.824 --> 10:09.391
and taste, of course.

10:09.434 --> 10:12.350
Worms are my most
favorite snack ever.

10:12.394 --> 10:14.091
- We should tell
the fair organizers

10:14.135 --> 10:16.050
that there are
birds in attendance.

10:16.093 --> 10:17.878
I bet they'd bring
in some yummy worms

10:17.921 --> 10:19.836
for you right away, buddy.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.969
- I'm just happy
to be here, Tiny.

10:22.012 --> 10:23.753
I might try some of that falafel

10:23.797 --> 10:25.189
you guys were talking about.

10:25.233 --> 10:27.322
It smells delicious.

10:27.365 --> 10:30.238
- You can never go wrong
with some toasty falafel,

10:30.281 --> 10:32.066
Weldon, trust me.

10:32.109 --> 10:36.418
- Okay, listen up, it's time
for our annual spelling bee

10:36.461 --> 10:37.811
qualifying round contest.

10:37.854 --> 10:40.857
Alright you three, once
you receive your word,

10:40.901 --> 10:42.990
there will be no talking,
and you'll have exactly

10:43.033 --> 10:45.209
five seconds to
begin your spelling.

10:45.253 --> 10:47.777
You will have one chance,
and one chance only,

10:47.821 --> 10:49.300
to spell your word.

10:49.344 --> 10:51.912
No doublebacks and no do-overs.

10:51.955 --> 10:56.264
Be sure to speak slowly,
clearly, concisely,

10:56.307 --> 10:58.919
and best of luck.

10:58.962 --> 11:01.399
Spike, you're up first.

11:01.443 --> 11:03.706
- [gulps] Uh, hi everybody.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.535
- Your word is commiserate.

11:08.102 --> 11:13.063
- Commiserate,
C-O-M-M-I-S-S-E-R-A-T-E,
uh, commiserate.

11:22.464 --> 11:24.771
- Sorry, Spike, Sorry.

11:24.814 --> 11:27.338
- Oh.
- That is incorrect.

11:27.382 --> 11:30.602
Thanks for trying little guy,
hope to see you next year.

11:30.646 --> 11:33.170
Harper.
- I'm ready, let's do this.

11:33.214 --> 11:36.130
- Your word is vandalize.

11:36.173 --> 11:37.609
- I got this.

11:37.653 --> 11:42.658
Vandalize, V-A-N-D-A-L-I-Z-E.

11:46.401 --> 11:47.489
- Correct.
- Woo!

11:48.795 --> 11:51.711
- We'll see you in the
spelling bee, Harper.

11:51.754 --> 11:52.494
- Woo!

11:53.843 --> 11:55.323
- Rhonda, are you ready?

11:55.366 --> 11:56.716
- I'm ready.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.892
- Your word is, handkerchief.

11:58.935 --> 12:01.851
- Ooh, handkerchief,

12:03.026 --> 12:07.988
H-A-N-D-K-E-R-C-H-I-E-F,
handkerchief.

12:13.471 --> 12:14.603
- Correct.
- Phew.

12:15.909 --> 12:17.998
- We'll see you on stage
at the big show, Rhonda.

12:18.041 --> 12:21.218
- Thank you, thank you.

12:21.262 --> 12:23.003
- Aw, that's too bad for Spike.

12:23.046 --> 12:26.093
- Less is more in
this case, Jumbo.

12:26.136 --> 12:28.443
I'm sure he'll be
back next year.

12:28.486 --> 12:31.751
- Alright, you guys,
there's no turning back now.

12:31.794 --> 12:33.796
I signed up all three of us,

12:33.840 --> 12:35.885
we're on after this next group.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.800
- [sighs] Okay.

12:39.062 --> 12:42.936
- Next, give a warm
jungle welcome to Della,

12:42.979 --> 12:45.808
Eddie, and Bert Hollis.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.941
- That's right,
right here, y'all.

12:47.984 --> 12:51.335
To the victor goes
the spoils, boo-yah.

12:51.379 --> 12:52.815
- Modest as ever.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.208
- Just like a Hollis.

12:54.251 --> 12:55.818
- I hate that frog.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.429
He picks on everyone
in school, too.

12:58.473 --> 13:00.431
I hope he gets embarrassed.

13:00.475 --> 13:02.825
- Everyone deserves a
fair chance, Weldon.

13:02.869 --> 13:05.480
Besides, Bert's a
pretty strong speller.

13:05.523 --> 13:07.874
- Whatever, I don't trust him.

13:07.917 --> 13:09.789
His uncle probably
paid off the judges.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.489
- Okay, first up is Della.

13:14.532 --> 13:15.446
- Hi all.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.927
- And your words is playwright.

13:17.971 --> 13:20.887
- Ha, don't mess up, Della.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.845
- No talking on stage, please.

13:22.889 --> 13:27.807
- Playwright,
P-L-A-Y-R-I-G-H-T, playwright.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.773
- So sorry, Della,
that is incorrect.

13:37.817 --> 13:41.821
- Oh, thanks for having me.

13:41.864 --> 13:42.865
- Buh-bye.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.780
- Eddie, are you ready?

13:44.824 --> 13:46.651
- Ready as I'll ever be.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.523
- That's not saying much.

13:48.566 --> 13:51.787
- Once again, no
talking on stage.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.007
Any further disobeying
of this rule

13:54.050 --> 13:55.791
may result in disqualification.

13:57.184 --> 14:00.404
- Yeah, DQ him, throw him out.

14:00.448 --> 14:01.971
- Weldon, shh.

14:02.015 --> 14:03.581
- Yeah, hush buddy.

14:03.625 --> 14:05.540
We don't wanna be thrown out.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.542
We're up next.

14:07.585 --> 14:11.154
- Eddie, your word is weird.

14:11.198 --> 14:12.590
- And so are you.

14:12.634 --> 14:14.288
- No talking!

14:14.331 --> 14:17.378
- Weird, hmm,

14:17.421 --> 14:22.165
I before E except after,

14:23.384 --> 14:26.387
after, um,

14:26.430 --> 14:27.910
- Come on, spit it out.

14:27.954 --> 14:29.303
- Bert, quiet.

14:30.565 --> 14:35.048
- Weird, W-I-R-E-D, weird.

14:36.049 --> 14:39.269
- Wired, he spelled wired?

14:39.313 --> 14:42.272
Come on man, is this
amateur night or what?

14:42.316 --> 14:44.927
- Bert Hollis, enough!

14:44.971 --> 14:47.495
- Give me some
competition up here.

14:47.538 --> 14:50.846
- We're very sorry, Eddie,
but that's incorrect.

14:50.890 --> 14:54.894
W-E-I-R-D is the
correct spelling.

14:54.937 --> 14:57.722
- Oh, that's right.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.682
I got nervous.

15:00.725 --> 15:02.727
- Excuses, excuses.

15:02.771 --> 15:05.208
- That will be
quite enough, Bert.

15:05.252 --> 15:07.254
Focus or step down.

15:07.297 --> 15:09.952
- Bring it on,
ready when you are.

15:09.996 --> 15:13.129
- I think we're all
ready for you to leave.

15:13.173 --> 15:16.916
Your word is conscience.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.875
- That's ironic, Bert
has no conscience.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.269
- Quiet in the audience, please.

15:22.312 --> 15:24.271
- Yeah, zip it lemmings.

15:24.314 --> 15:27.187
- Bert, one more
outburst and you will be

15:27.230 --> 15:28.797
disqualified on the spot.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.756
- Okay, okay, conscience,

15:31.800 --> 15:36.805
C-O-N-S-C-I-E-N-C-E, conscience.

15:37.501 --> 15:38.763
[crowd cheers]

15:38.807 --> 15:39.634
- He did it.

15:39.677 --> 15:40.940
- Made it look easy.

15:41.897 --> 15:42.898
- It's fixed.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.770
- Correct.
- Boom.

15:45.814 --> 15:48.860
- We'll see you in the
championship round, Bert.

15:48.904 --> 15:50.297
Good day to you.

15:50.340 --> 15:52.081
- Good day to you too, Jeeves.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.954
Keep that trophy nice
and polished for me.

15:55.824 --> 15:57.739
- Ugh, what a jerk.

15:57.782 --> 15:59.175
- What an ego.

15:59.219 --> 16:00.568
Bert's got issues.

16:00.611 --> 16:02.613
- I told you guys
he was no good.

16:02.657 --> 16:05.268
- Moving on, thankfully.

16:05.312 --> 16:08.880
Next up, please lend a
warm welcome to Jumbo,

16:08.924 --> 16:11.579
Tiny, and Weldon.
[crowd cheers]

16:11.622 --> 16:12.406
- That's us.

16:12.449 --> 16:13.407
- Here we go.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.931
[upbeat music]

16:18.978 --> 16:22.633
- Welcome you three,
Tiny, you're up first.

16:22.677 --> 16:26.724
- Hi everybody.
- And your word is indict.

16:26.768 --> 16:31.729
- Ooh, indict,
I-N-D-I-T-E, indict.

16:35.037 --> 16:37.779
- Sorry Tiny, that's incorrect.

16:37.822 --> 16:40.782
- Oh, darn.

16:40.825 --> 16:42.218
Good luck guys.

16:42.262 --> 16:43.611
- Thanks Tiny.

16:43.654 --> 16:45.091
Sorry to see you go.

16:45.134 --> 16:46.614
- Bye T.

16:46.657 --> 16:49.356
- Weldon, you're next.

16:49.399 --> 16:50.139
- I'm ready.

16:50.183 --> 16:53.055
- Your word is cemetery.

16:53.099 --> 16:58.060
- Cemetery, C-E-M-E-T-A-R-Y.

17:01.890 --> 17:03.457
- So sorry, Weldon.

17:04.849 --> 17:09.463
The proper spelling of
cemetery is C-E-M-E-T-E-R-Y.

17:14.859 --> 17:18.820
The last E is sometimes
substituted with an A,

17:18.863 --> 17:20.822
but that is incorrect.

17:20.865 --> 17:22.128
Thank you for competing.

17:22.171 --> 17:23.999
- Oh well, thanks everybody.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.609
Knock 'em dead, Jumbo.

17:25.653 --> 17:26.871
- I'll try, Weldon.

17:26.915 --> 17:30.832
- Okay, last but
not least, Jumbo.

17:30.875 --> 17:33.835
Your word is millennium.

17:37.056 --> 17:40.015
- Millennium,
that's a tough one.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.670
- Jumbo's got it, he can
spell that in his sleep.

17:42.713 --> 17:43.932
- Can you spell it?

17:43.975 --> 17:48.806
- I think so, M-I-L,
oh, I give up.

17:50.112 --> 17:55.074
- Millennium,
M-I-L-L-E-N-N-I-U-M, millennium.

17:58.512 --> 17:59.861
[crowd cheers]
- Correct.

18:01.558 --> 18:02.994
- Yay!
- Yay!

18:03.038 --> 18:05.954
- We very much look
forward to seeing you again

18:05.997 --> 18:07.825
during the competition, Jumbo.

18:07.869 --> 18:09.784
- Thank you so much.

18:09.827 --> 18:12.874
I look forward to
being there, bye.

18:12.917 --> 18:15.485
[playful music]

18:19.402 --> 18:20.925
- You did it, Jumbo.

18:20.969 --> 18:23.189
You were every bit
as fast and certain

18:23.232 --> 18:24.886
as that big bully Bert.

18:24.929 --> 18:27.497
- Yeah, I think you have
that spelling bee in the bag,

18:27.541 --> 18:31.893
Jumbo, your memory's just
too good, you elephant, you.

18:31.936 --> 18:33.373
- You guys flatter me.

18:33.416 --> 18:36.071
But seriously, the
bee's gonna be tough.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.856
Just one slipup,
and you're finished.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.031
Anyone can win it.

18:40.075 --> 18:42.033
- Well, I'm with Tiny.

18:42.077 --> 18:43.731
My money's on you, pal.

18:43.774 --> 18:45.254
- I'd have to say
the front runners

18:45.298 --> 18:47.822
are easily you and Bert Hollis.

18:47.865 --> 18:50.999
- Ugh, anybody but Bert.

18:51.042 --> 18:53.349
You've gotta win,
Jumbo, you have to.

18:53.393 --> 18:55.090
- I'll do my best, Weldon.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.353
It's all any of us can ever do.

18:57.397 --> 19:01.227
And if Bert wins, so be it,
it's not the end of the world.

19:01.270 --> 19:03.011
- Well, speak for yourself.

19:03.054 --> 19:05.709
If Bert Hollis wins
that spelling bee,

19:05.753 --> 19:07.929
I, for one, am going
to be so depressed,

19:07.972 --> 19:10.888
I might sleep for a whole month.

19:10.932 --> 19:14.501
- And I might eat all
the falafel in the
fair all by myself.

19:14.544 --> 19:17.373
- Oh, falafel, we
forgot to get some.

19:17.417 --> 19:21.725
- Nuh uh, not me, Bert's still
back there talking smack.

19:21.769 --> 19:23.640
I'll go tomorrow.

19:23.684 --> 19:27.122
Besides, I don't have a spelling
bee to train for anymore.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.819
- I'm sorry guys.

19:28.863 --> 19:32.562
You watch, next year will
be your year, both of you.

19:32.606 --> 19:34.825
- As long as you win it
all this year, Jumbo,

19:34.869 --> 19:36.653
I'm okay with that.

19:36.697 --> 19:39.917
- I second that, Jumbo or bust.

19:39.961 --> 19:41.963
All hail Jumbo.

19:42.006 --> 19:44.313
- Come on you two,
don't get carried away.

19:44.357 --> 19:47.534
- Ha, I'll tell you who's
gonna get carried away,

19:47.577 --> 19:50.058
Bert, I betcha he's
blowing his top

19:50.101 --> 19:52.408
that you advanced to
the championship round.

19:52.452 --> 19:55.150
- That's right, you're the
one animal in this jungle

19:55.194 --> 19:57.457
who can defeat him at
pretty much anything.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.285
And he knows it.

19:59.328 --> 20:00.764
- Oh, come on now.

20:00.808 --> 20:04.246
I'm sure Bert's fine with
competing against me in the bee.

20:04.290 --> 20:06.292
We're all adults
here, after all,

20:06.335 --> 20:08.163
and it's just a contest.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.864
[dramatic music]

20:15.518 --> 20:18.869
- I tried, Bert, but the
judges wouldn't hear of it.

20:18.913 --> 20:21.785
They said all animals
were now free to enter

20:21.829 --> 20:25.528
and compete regardless of their
brain size or intelligence.

20:25.572 --> 20:27.269
- All animals?

20:27.313 --> 20:30.881
What nincompoop came up with
that silly equality rubbish?

20:30.925 --> 20:33.144
It'll be the end of
the bee as we know it.

20:33.188 --> 20:35.973
- Nonsense, the only
thing that can end

20:36.017 --> 20:39.716
the jungle spelling bee
is if I say it's over.

20:39.760 --> 20:43.416
Remember, I funded the
bee in the first place,

20:43.459 --> 20:47.463
and money makes the
world go 'round.

20:47.507 --> 20:50.814
He who has the most money wins,

20:50.858 --> 20:53.382
and nobody has more than I do.

20:53.426 --> 20:55.819
I am the mogul of moguls,

20:55.863 --> 20:58.431
the tycoon of tycoons,

20:58.474 --> 21:01.390
the entrepreneur
of entrepreneurs,

21:01.434 --> 21:04.045
the CEO of CEOs,

21:04.088 --> 21:06.917
the amphibian of amphibians,

21:06.961 --> 21:09.920
and I rule this land
with webbed feet

21:09.964 --> 21:11.400
and a bullwhip tongue.

21:11.444 --> 21:13.881
- I do like your
style, Uncle Ron.

21:13.924 --> 21:18.494
- Mr. Hollis, Bert,
call me Mr. Hollis.

21:19.365 --> 21:20.583
- Right, sorry.

21:20.627 --> 21:23.804
- Yes, well, remember,
the power position

21:23.847 --> 21:25.806
is the only position, nephew.

21:25.849 --> 21:29.244
And don't worry, we won't
let some floppy-eared,

21:29.288 --> 21:31.507
droopy-trunked
elephant get in the way

21:31.551 --> 21:35.685
of our new ventures and take
what's rightfully yours.

21:35.729 --> 21:40.516
You're Bert Hollis,
next in line to inherit

21:40.560 --> 21:42.779
my entire empire.

21:42.823 --> 21:47.523
- I am, whoa, uncle
Ro-, I mean Mr. Hollis,

21:47.567 --> 21:49.351
I had no idea.

21:49.395 --> 21:52.485
My pops thinks he's set to
inherit the keys to your empire

21:52.528 --> 21:53.660
when you retire.

21:53.703 --> 21:56.184
- Your father, ha!

21:56.227 --> 21:59.492
That's the funniest joke
I've heard in a long time.

21:59.535 --> 22:01.885
The only keys I'd give
your father are the keys

22:01.929 --> 22:05.715
to this high-rises's
janitorial closet,

22:05.759 --> 22:09.371
because that's the only
job he's fit for here.

22:09.415 --> 22:14.028
- Ha, ha, ha, that's true,
Mr. Hollis, Pops is a loser,

22:14.071 --> 22:16.204
Always has been, always will be.

22:16.247 --> 22:20.513
He enjoys nature and lily pads,

22:20.556 --> 22:23.864
sunshine and fresh water.

22:23.907 --> 22:27.084
He knows nothing of
business and success.

22:27.128 --> 22:31.524
- [laughs] That's
right, Bert, he doesn't.

22:31.567 --> 22:34.265
Your dad's always had
his head in the clouds

22:34.309 --> 22:35.876
and his feet in the pond.

22:35.919 --> 22:39.967
I tried to reason with
him, but some frogs

22:40.010 --> 22:43.187
you just can't reach.

22:43.231 --> 22:46.974
So you get your father,
luckily his kind

22:47.017 --> 22:50.978
of idiocy skips a
generation, so I have you,

22:51.021 --> 22:53.546
and you're a winner, nephew.

22:53.589 --> 22:58.420
- Yes I am, just like
you Unc-, Mr. Hollis.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.857
- Tell me what I
already know, kid.

23:00.901 --> 23:05.384
In the business world, he
who finishes last loses.

23:06.776 --> 23:09.083
And Hollises aren't losers.

23:10.171 --> 23:11.825
- No, we're not.

23:11.868 --> 23:15.916
- While the rest of these
jungle beasts play checkers,

23:15.959 --> 23:18.832
we play 3D chess.

23:18.875 --> 23:20.703
- Yes, we do.
- And I've got

23:20.747 --> 23:23.967
a little trick up my sleeve
that'll ensure nobody

23:24.011 --> 23:27.406
but you wins that
spelling bee, Bert.

23:28.319 --> 23:32.454
Nobody but you. [evil laughs]

23:34.543 --> 23:35.849
- That's correct.

23:35.892 --> 23:38.155
Okay, let's try
another one, ready?

23:38.199 --> 23:40.157
- I'm ready.
- You asked for it,

23:40.201 --> 23:42.159
this one's tricky.

23:42.203 --> 23:43.987
- Hit me with your
best shot, Tiny.

23:44.031 --> 23:48.775
- Oh, I'm gonna,
your word is pharaoh.

23:48.818 --> 23:49.819
- Ooh, good one.

23:49.863 --> 23:51.691
- Pharaoh, hmm,

23:52.692 --> 23:56.173
P-H-A-R-

23:56.217 --> 23:58.045
- Careful Jumbo, think about it.

23:59.829 --> 24:04.747
- P-H-A-R-A-O-H, pharaoh,

24:05.618 --> 24:06.967
- Wow.
- Correct.

24:07.010 --> 24:08.229
- Whew, that was a tough on.

24:08.272 --> 24:10.971
- You've got this,
Jumbo, you've got it.

24:11.014 --> 24:14.801
I'm telling you, there's
no way you can lose.

24:14.844 --> 24:17.151
- Don't make me
overconfident, Tiny.

24:17.194 --> 24:19.240
Overconfidence
leads to mistakes.

24:19.283 --> 24:21.242
- That's true, it does.

24:21.285 --> 24:23.897
You may or may not
win this thing, Jumbo.

24:23.940 --> 24:26.247
Your vocabulary's
elementary, and your skills

24:26.290 --> 24:27.988
are marginal at best.

24:28.031 --> 24:32.209
- Okay, now that's a little
too far the other way, Weldon.

24:32.253 --> 24:34.473
- That's right, we
don't wanna make Jumbo

24:34.516 --> 24:37.127
feel bad about himself
either, Weldon.

24:37.171 --> 24:40.827
That'll accomplish nothing,
and you can bet Mr. Hollis

24:40.870 --> 24:43.960
isn't browbeating Bert
about what a dummy he is.

24:44.004 --> 24:45.266
- That's true.

24:45.309 --> 24:47.964
- Yeah, it's probably
an understatement.

24:48.008 --> 24:51.315
I bet Hollis is spit
shining Bert's lily pad,

24:51.359 --> 24:53.883
filling his head with
ridiculous flights of fancy

24:53.927 --> 24:56.146
and wild ideas of grandeur.

24:56.190 --> 24:59.976
- Now guys, Ron Hollis
is a jungle animal,

25:00.020 --> 25:04.241
just like we are, with hopes,
dreams, likes, dislikes,

25:04.285 --> 25:06.200
wants, and desires.

25:06.243 --> 25:08.507
It's important that we
don't marginalize him

25:08.550 --> 25:10.770
and paint him as
some kind of monster.

25:10.813 --> 25:13.424
I'm sure that behind the scenes

25:13.468 --> 25:15.862
he's a perfectly swell frog.

25:16.863 --> 25:19.779
[dramatic music]

25:21.607 --> 25:24.523
- I know exactly how
you feel, Mr. Hollis.

25:24.566 --> 25:26.568
I hate elephants, too.

25:26.612 --> 25:29.615
They're ugly, they
take up too much space,

25:29.658 --> 25:31.007
and they smell funny.

25:31.051 --> 25:34.837
- Right, they're an
embarrassment to jungle life,

25:34.881 --> 25:37.361
a blight on the land.

25:37.405 --> 25:39.450
They're not even
good for manual labor

25:39.494 --> 25:42.236
since they were liberated
from those traveling shows

25:42.279 --> 25:45.195
that at least used to
keep them contained.

25:45.239 --> 25:48.372
- You know, I know a word
doctor who can handle

25:48.416 --> 25:51.419
this problem, but
it'll cost you.

25:51.462 --> 25:52.986
He doesn't come cheap.

25:53.029 --> 25:54.770
- Oh, I would hope not.

25:54.814 --> 25:57.904
I must find a way to
knock Jumbo the elephant

25:57.947 --> 26:00.341
out of contention,
and clear the way

26:00.384 --> 26:03.779
for my nephew Bert
to win it all.

26:03.823 --> 26:07.174
- I see, well in that case,

26:07.217 --> 26:09.959
why don't we just go
and see my friend now.

26:10.003 --> 26:13.441
He can get sketchy when he's
surprised, but he knows me,

26:13.484 --> 26:15.748
which greatly reduces
his chances of attacking.

26:15.791 --> 26:19.142
- Oh, well, that's good to know.

26:19.186 --> 26:21.928
Take me to the word doctor.

26:21.971 --> 26:25.801
I'll make him an offer
he cannot refuse.

26:30.066 --> 26:32.808
Ugh, is it much
farther, Atticus?

26:32.852 --> 26:37.596
I am parched, I'm an amphibian,
you know, we need water.

26:37.639 --> 26:40.773
- You're telling me,
I'm a great white shark.

26:40.816 --> 26:44.690
In this day and age of
manmade ponds, lakes,

26:44.733 --> 26:48.084
creeks, and streams,
doesn't anybody realize

26:48.128 --> 26:49.825
sharks do business, too?

26:49.869 --> 26:53.089
- I'll tell you what, Atticus,
if this mysterious friend

26:53.133 --> 26:55.570
of yours can help
torpedo Jumbo's chances

26:55.614 --> 26:58.834
of winning that spelling
bee, I'll send in my workers

26:58.878 --> 27:02.359
and carve that canal just
for you, free of charge.

27:04.318 --> 27:05.798
- You will?

27:05.841 --> 27:07.538
Then consider it done.

27:07.582 --> 27:10.237
I'll personally broker
this deal and make certain

27:10.280 --> 27:11.804
it's a win-win for us all.

27:11.847 --> 27:15.634
- Excellent, I'm
looking forward to it.

27:15.677 --> 27:18.332
- Hollis, I think this
could be the beginning

27:18.375 --> 27:20.421
of a beautiful partnership.

27:20.464 --> 27:21.248
- Who!?

27:22.989 --> 27:26.253
Who dares breach my
sacred lair unannounced?

27:26.296 --> 27:27.733
- It's me, Magnus.

27:27.776 --> 27:31.345
It's me, Atticus, your
old friend, remember?

27:31.388 --> 27:33.216
- Atticus, the shark?

27:33.260 --> 27:34.740
- The one and only.

27:34.783 --> 27:36.176
How you been, killer?

27:36.219 --> 27:37.917
- Hungry.

27:37.960 --> 27:40.397
Word got out that there's
a predator in these woods.

27:40.441 --> 27:42.748
Now my prey's dried up.

27:42.791 --> 27:44.880
I've had nothing to eat
but cucumbers and squash

27:44.924 --> 27:46.577
for a whole week.

27:46.621 --> 27:51.017
- Cucumbers and squash are
actually very nutritious.

27:52.540 --> 27:53.933
One could thrive on the
nutrients they provide alone.

27:53.976 --> 27:54.977
- Who's this?

27:55.021 --> 27:57.023
- This is Ron Hollis, Magnus.

27:57.066 --> 27:58.546
You might've heard of him,

27:58.589 --> 28:00.722
the real estate tycoon
from the big city.

28:02.332 --> 28:04.421
- Smells like a frog to me.

28:04.465 --> 28:06.510
- That's because I am a frog,

28:06.554 --> 28:09.470
more accurately, I am the frog.

28:09.513 --> 28:12.212
I've cut every deal,
constructed every building,

28:12.255 --> 28:13.517
had every worker in court,

28:13.561 --> 28:16.390
every shot from here
to the Arctic pole

28:16.433 --> 28:18.871
for probably as long
as you've been alive.

28:18.914 --> 28:22.178
- Hmm, how much longer
do you suppose you'll

28:22.222 --> 28:23.832
be alive, frog?

28:23.876 --> 28:28.576
- Uh, Atticus, would you like
to clarify for your friend?

28:29.751 --> 28:31.971
- Magnus, we're
here to ask a favor.

28:32.014 --> 28:33.276
- No.
- No?

28:33.320 --> 28:34.103
- No!

28:34.147 --> 28:36.323
- What does he mean, no?

28:36.366 --> 28:38.978
- He, uh, he means no.

28:39.021 --> 28:39.979
- Sorry, one second.

28:40.936 --> 28:43.591
I'm not familiar with that word.

28:43.634 --> 28:45.114
What exactly is it referring to?

28:45.158 --> 28:47.290
- To your favor, frog.

28:47.334 --> 28:49.902
The answer is no.

28:49.945 --> 28:52.731
You don't come to my home
with your webbed hands out,

28:52.774 --> 28:55.995
you come bearing gifts
and begging mercy,

28:56.038 --> 28:57.997
or you don't come at all.

28:58.040 --> 29:00.347
- Whoa, Ron Hollis begging?

29:03.785 --> 29:05.395
I don't think so.

29:05.439 --> 29:06.962
- Hollis, don't.

29:07.006 --> 29:09.660
- And I'll tell you
another thing, car chaser,

29:09.704 --> 29:11.227
if you think you're safe here,

29:11.271 --> 29:13.142
you've got another thing coming.

29:13.186 --> 29:17.059
I can snap my webbed fingers
and pave over this dump

29:17.103 --> 29:20.933
in an afternoon, turn it
into a condor rescue facility

29:20.976 --> 29:22.848
by tomorrow morning.

29:22.891 --> 29:24.414
You got that?

29:24.458 --> 29:26.634
- Sassy.
- You know it

29:26.677 --> 29:31.508
I'm Ron Hollis, and that name
carries weight around here.

29:32.118 --> 29:34.120
- Oh, oh boy.

29:34.163 --> 29:38.515
- You're entertaining, Ron
Hollis, you make me laugh.

29:38.559 --> 29:39.908
I'll give you a second chance.

29:39.952 --> 29:44.652
- Oh, you give me a chance?

29:44.695 --> 29:46.785
- Take the chance,
Hollis, take the chance.

29:46.828 --> 29:50.745
- That's right, explain
this favor you seek.

29:50.789 --> 29:53.922
Who knows, I might grant it.

29:53.966 --> 29:55.750
Or I might bite you in two.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.970
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

29:58.013 --> 30:00.973
Frog's legs are some
of my favorite snacks.

30:01.016 --> 30:03.714
- Well, well, alright.

30:03.758 --> 30:04.977
- Alright.

30:05.020 --> 30:08.197
- Alright, I don't want
to be bitten in two.

30:08.241 --> 30:09.851
I want to make a deal.

30:09.895 --> 30:11.157
- Well played.

30:11.200 --> 30:12.811
- Out with it, frog.

30:12.854 --> 30:16.162
- My nephew's competing in the
jungle spelling bee shortly,

30:16.205 --> 30:17.946
and he's a lock to win.

30:17.990 --> 30:22.690
In fact, he's never misspelled
a word in his whole life.

30:22.733 --> 30:24.779
- Sounds like a
pretentious little brat.

30:24.823 --> 30:27.129
- Oh he is, he's horrible.

30:28.348 --> 30:31.699
But, just like
me, he's a winner.

30:31.742 --> 30:34.789
There's just one animal
standing in his way.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.878
- If it's a wolf,
I can't help you.

30:36.922 --> 30:38.271
We stick together.

30:38.314 --> 30:40.969
- It's not a wolf,
it's an elephant.

30:41.013 --> 30:42.579
- An elephant, blech.

30:43.493 --> 30:44.668
I hate elephants.

30:44.712 --> 30:45.756
- So do we.

30:45.800 --> 30:46.932
- That's right.

30:46.975 --> 30:49.935
I mean, they taste good,
but that's about it.

30:49.978 --> 30:52.851
- This elephant is
particularly annoying.

30:52.894 --> 30:55.592
He's a nuisance to
the whole jungle,

30:55.636 --> 30:58.813
and snooty, thinks
he knows it all.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.207
- Yes, most of
those elephants do.

31:01.250 --> 31:04.297
- Superiority
complexes, big heads.

31:04.340 --> 31:07.387
- I want to stop him from
entering that spelling bee

31:07.430 --> 31:09.476
with my nephew.

31:09.519 --> 31:13.393
And, if he does have the
gall to get on stage,

31:13.436 --> 31:18.398
I want him to be useless,
as dumb as a bag of rocks.

31:19.268 --> 31:21.009
- That's a tall order, frog.

31:21.053 --> 31:22.837
Why should I help you?

31:22.881 --> 31:25.405
- Because I can
help you, Magnus.

31:25.448 --> 31:30.062
Your prey is dwindling, you're
about to starve out here.

31:30.105 --> 31:34.370
Do business with me and
I'll see that you don't.

31:34.414 --> 31:36.242
- Oh.
- Oh yes.

31:36.285 --> 31:38.287
I'll make one call
and stock these woods

31:38.331 --> 31:41.508
with more caribou, and
bison, and elk, and beaver

31:41.551 --> 31:43.771
than you can shake your tail at.

31:43.814 --> 31:47.035
Your plate will be full
enough for three lifetimes.

31:48.341 --> 31:50.778
- Well, since you
put it that way,

31:50.821 --> 31:52.475
the doctor is in.

31:52.519 --> 31:53.259
- Excellent.

31:54.521 --> 31:57.176
- What say I prescribe
you a certain word

31:57.219 --> 32:00.440
that will cause whomever
utters it to lose

32:00.483 --> 32:02.833
their memory completely?

32:02.877 --> 32:06.272
- I'd say that's
splendid, splendid indeed.

32:06.315 --> 32:07.882
- Very well then.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.319
All you have to do is
get the subject to utter

32:10.363 --> 32:12.931
this word aloud, and it is done.

32:12.974 --> 32:14.889
- What is the word, tell me.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.064
- I'll tell you.

32:16.108 --> 32:19.241
But if I see no elk,
caribou, moose, beaver,

32:19.285 --> 32:21.809
or the like in one
hour's time, I'll render

32:21.852 --> 32:23.811
the word null and void.

32:23.854 --> 32:26.901
Your elephant can say
it 100 times, shout it

32:26.945 --> 32:30.252
from the treetops, it will
do nothing but sound good

32:30.296 --> 32:31.645
rolling off his tongue.

32:31.688 --> 32:34.430
- Fair enough, what's the word?

32:34.474 --> 32:36.041
- You must say it first, frog,

32:36.084 --> 32:39.696
but I can give you a
clue to point the way.

32:39.740 --> 32:40.480
Here it is,

32:41.655 --> 32:43.396
what is your favorite
thing to make?

32:43.439 --> 32:47.966
- Hmm, my favorite thing
to make, of course, money!

32:49.445 --> 32:51.273
- Goodness, you are
shallow, aren't you?

32:51.317 --> 32:53.188
- What, that's not it?

32:53.232 --> 32:55.625
- Oh.
- Okay, give me one more try.

32:56.887 --> 32:59.890
My favorite thing to
make, I know, a deal.

33:01.283 --> 33:03.851
[playful music]

33:11.032 --> 33:12.860
- Hi, Albert, how's
the fair been going?

33:12.903 --> 33:14.731
- It's great, Jumbo.

33:14.775 --> 33:17.038
Attendance is up from last
year, and there's been

33:17.082 --> 33:19.388
no falcon trouble
like that one time.

33:19.432 --> 33:20.955
- Oh, that's great.

33:20.999 --> 33:24.045
Those falcons sure
stirred it up, boy.

33:24.089 --> 33:25.699
- Tell me about it.

33:25.742 --> 33:28.702
We had to hand stitch all our
big top roofs back together.

33:28.745 --> 33:30.617
- Tedious.
- What's that mean?

33:30.660 --> 33:33.141
- Oh, it means tiresome
and monotonous.

33:33.185 --> 33:34.751
- Mo-no-to-what?

33:34.795 --> 33:38.320
- Sorry, Albert, it means
long, slow, and dull.

33:38.364 --> 33:39.626
- Ah.

33:39.669 --> 33:41.454
You and your big words,

33:41.497 --> 33:43.499
I bet you can't wait for
the spelling bee, huh?

33:43.543 --> 33:46.894
- No, it's gonna
be fun, for sure.

33:46.937 --> 33:47.764
- Think you're gonna win?

33:47.808 --> 33:48.852
- You never know.

33:48.896 --> 33:51.681
- Well, Bert Hollis
says he knows.

33:51.725 --> 33:54.423
He says he's unbeatable,
says his uncle's seen to it

33:54.467 --> 33:55.816
that he can't lose.

33:55.859 --> 33:57.383
- Oh yeah?

33:57.426 --> 33:59.776
Just how does he
plan to do that?

33:59.820 --> 34:02.257
We'll all be up on
stage by ourselves,

34:02.301 --> 34:05.956
and we'll either spell our
words correctly or we won't.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.741
There's no way to cheat.

34:07.784 --> 34:09.786
- Who said anything
about cheating, Jumbo?

34:09.830 --> 34:13.268
- Topper, some
things never change.

34:13.312 --> 34:15.879
I should've known you'd
be in the thick of things,

34:15.923 --> 34:18.230
eavesdropping on conversations.

34:18.273 --> 34:20.406
- I ain't
eavesdropping, big boy.

34:20.449 --> 34:22.538
I've turned over a new leaf.

34:22.582 --> 34:23.757
- Is that so?

34:23.800 --> 34:26.760
Not associating with
the falcons anymore, eh?

34:26.803 --> 34:28.936
- Nah, tent vandalism?

34:29.806 --> 34:31.852
They think too small.

34:31.895 --> 34:34.202
I'm on to bigger things.

34:34.246 --> 34:36.770
I work for Mr. Hollis now.

34:36.813 --> 34:38.772
And he told me to find you.

34:38.815 --> 34:40.034
- Mr. Hollis?

34:40.078 --> 34:42.602
- Well, you found
me, what do you want?

34:42.645 --> 34:45.474
- I don't want nothing,
Mr. Hollis does.

34:45.518 --> 34:46.780
- What does he want?

34:46.823 --> 34:48.695
- He wants to see
you right away.

34:48.738 --> 34:50.871
- Whoa, that can't be good.

34:50.914 --> 34:52.786
- What's this about, Topper?

34:52.829 --> 34:54.744
- He's got a business
proposal for ya,

34:54.788 --> 34:57.007
an offer you can't refuse.

34:57.051 --> 34:59.836
- Oh no, I saw The Godfather.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.925
Don't go, Jumbo, don't go.

35:01.969 --> 35:04.406
- Why, I've done nothing wrong.

35:04.450 --> 35:05.668
Tell him I'll talk to him.

35:05.712 --> 35:08.062
- He said he wants you
to meet him downtown

35:08.106 --> 35:10.630
at the top-floor apartment
of his high-rise.

35:10.673 --> 35:13.198
- Fine, when?
- As soon as you can.

35:13.241 --> 35:16.331
- Ah, Jumbo, be careful.

35:16.375 --> 35:19.900
The city's a big,
bustling, dangerous place,

35:19.943 --> 35:21.989
look both ways before
crossing the street,

35:22.032 --> 35:25.210
and take everything that frog
says with a grain of salt.

35:25.253 --> 35:27.995
City slickers are the
jungle's natural enemies.

35:28.038 --> 35:30.563
- Don't listen to
this kid, Jumbo.

35:30.606 --> 35:34.175
He works in a fair booth
for crying out loud.

35:34.219 --> 35:36.351
It's his job to mislead ya.

35:36.395 --> 35:39.789
What if Hollis likes your
style and wants to sponsor you?

35:39.833 --> 35:41.400
- Likes my style?

35:41.443 --> 35:44.054
That's crazy, I
don't have any style.

35:44.098 --> 35:46.927
- Well, true, still,

35:46.970 --> 35:50.626
that frog can open doors that
don't even exist out here.

35:50.670 --> 35:53.412
Opportunity only
knocks one time, Jumbo.

35:53.455 --> 35:56.763
You can either answer the
door, or let it pass you by.

35:56.806 --> 35:57.590
- Hmmm.

36:01.681 --> 36:05.859
Nice place you have
here, Mr. Ho-, or Ron.

36:05.902 --> 36:09.776
- Thank you, Jumbo, you'd blush
if I told you what it cost.

36:09.819 --> 36:12.735
My only recourse was
to turn my company

36:12.779 --> 36:15.956
into such a raging success
that money poured in

36:15.999 --> 36:20.003
from every crack and crevice
until I could literally afford

36:20.047 --> 36:22.441
anything in this world I wanted.

36:22.484 --> 36:23.920
- Wow.
- And I do

36:23.964 --> 36:25.618
mean anything, Jumbo.

36:25.661 --> 36:27.924
- That sounds fun.
- It is.

36:27.968 --> 36:30.753
You're not a dim beast, Jumbo.

36:30.797 --> 36:33.626
You saw them out there,
hustling and bustling,

36:33.669 --> 36:36.237
back and forth, to and fro,

36:36.281 --> 36:39.762
keeping pace, racing the clock,

36:39.806 --> 36:43.070
so mired in the rat race
that they can no longer

36:43.113 --> 36:45.420
see the jungle from
their office windows,

36:45.464 --> 36:50.033
so weighed down by pointless
burden and empty obligation

36:50.077 --> 36:52.906
that they can't raise their
heads above their cubicles

36:52.949 --> 36:55.430
to see anything around them.

36:55.474 --> 36:56.736
It's no way to live.

36:56.779 --> 36:58.477
- It sure doesn't look like it.

36:58.520 --> 37:02.959
- Yes, but animals like
yourself know otherwise.

37:03.003 --> 37:06.789
You and my nephew here
see beyond the matrix

37:06.833 --> 37:09.879
that's been constructed
for the lesser beings.

37:09.923 --> 37:13.056
Your minds are free, therefore,

37:13.100 --> 37:15.711
your potential is limitless.

37:15.755 --> 37:16.930
- That's right.

37:16.973 --> 37:19.846
- Jumbo, what would
you say if I told you

37:19.889 --> 37:21.761
I had a rare offer for you?

37:21.804 --> 37:23.850
- An offer I can't refuse?

37:23.893 --> 37:28.985
- [laughs] Something like that.

37:29.029 --> 37:32.598
- That didn't work out so
good for Meerkat Corleone.

37:32.641 --> 37:33.773
- Didn't it?

37:33.816 --> 37:36.254
Depends on what
you consider good.

37:37.516 --> 37:38.995
- Ungrateful elephant.

37:39.039 --> 37:40.649
- What was that, Bert?

37:40.693 --> 37:43.130
Always project
your voice, nephew.

37:43.173 --> 37:46.786
Remember, address them like
you would in the boardroom

37:46.829 --> 37:49.092
and they'll never
fail to fall in line

37:49.136 --> 37:51.007
behind your force of will.

37:51.051 --> 37:53.880
- But I've never been in
a boardroom, Mr. Hollis.

37:53.923 --> 37:56.622
How would I know how
you address folks?

37:56.665 --> 38:01.191
- It's your outside voice,
Bert, use your outside voice.

38:01.235 --> 38:03.237
- Okay.
- As I was saying,

38:03.281 --> 38:07.807
Jumbo, I have an exceptional
opportunity for you,

38:07.850 --> 38:10.070
if you choose to accept.

38:10.113 --> 38:12.202
- Okay, I'm all ears.

38:12.246 --> 38:14.988
- [laughs] You can
say that again.

38:15.031 --> 38:17.860
- Please, Bert, hush.

38:17.904 --> 38:22.517
What if I told you that
you and my nephew here

38:22.561 --> 38:24.737
could share the
jungle-wide limelight

38:24.780 --> 38:26.913
of a spelling bee tie.

38:26.956 --> 38:28.262
- A tie?
- A tie?

38:28.306 --> 38:32.048
- A tie, you're both clearly
the two front runners

38:32.092 --> 38:33.876
to win that contest.

38:33.920 --> 38:35.878
- I think I edge
him out, though.

38:35.922 --> 38:37.967
- Follow me here, Jumbo.

38:38.011 --> 38:41.928
You two boys tie at the
end, following a nail-biter

38:41.971 --> 38:43.712
of a contest.

38:43.756 --> 38:46.889
The jungle audience will be
torn with half the animals

38:46.933 --> 38:50.763
feeling you won, and
half feeling Bert won.

38:50.806 --> 38:52.982
- You really think
half our animals

38:53.026 --> 38:54.723
will be sympathetic to Bert?

38:54.767 --> 38:56.029
- Hey.
- I do,

38:56.072 --> 38:57.770
because we'll color it that way.

38:57.813 --> 39:01.513
You boys will play
up the drama onstage,

39:01.556 --> 39:04.254
stutter a word here,
hang on a pause there,

39:04.298 --> 39:07.040
play the crowd like a fiddle
to up their investment

39:07.083 --> 39:09.303
in the drama and pageantry.

39:09.347 --> 39:12.045
- Mr. Hollis, are
you suggesting we rig

39:12.088 --> 39:13.916
the spelling bee's outcome?

39:13.960 --> 39:18.878
- Rig, no, rig is
such an ugly word.

39:19.835 --> 39:20.967
Rig is for losers.

39:21.924 --> 39:24.100
Don't think like a loser, Jumbo.

39:25.363 --> 39:29.497
Remember, free mind
equals free body,

39:29.541 --> 39:32.413
and free bodies take
lots of vacations

39:32.457 --> 39:34.807
with all the money they make.

39:34.850 --> 39:37.940
- Oh, okay.
- After the bee ends

39:37.984 --> 39:40.029
in a dramatic tie, we'll be free

39:40.073 --> 39:43.946
to book follow-up
events throughout the
jungle and beyond.

39:43.990 --> 39:47.559
I mean Friday night showdowns
at Macaw Square Garden,

39:47.602 --> 39:50.910
Saturday night sellouts
at Capuchin Event Center.

39:50.953 --> 39:53.652
The opportunities are endless.

39:53.695 --> 39:55.784
It's an open ticket
to print money,

39:55.828 --> 39:59.048
as opposed to a single,
clear-cut winner,

39:59.092 --> 40:00.963
which will provide
a spike in interest

40:01.007 --> 40:02.965
that dwindles the day after,

40:03.009 --> 40:05.751
and is all but
forgotten a week later.

40:05.794 --> 40:08.318
You know those animals'
attention spans.

40:08.362 --> 40:10.495
We have something shiny,
and they'll forget

40:10.538 --> 40:12.453
what they were
doing a second ago.

40:12.497 --> 40:14.890
- Dummies.
- Hush, Bert.

40:14.934 --> 40:16.892
Let our guest talk.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.983
What do you say,
Jumbo, do we have a--

40:21.027 --> 40:22.985
- A deal?
- Yes.

40:23.029 --> 40:26.424
- No, wait, I was
asking, not agreeing.

40:26.467 --> 40:30.384
It doesn't matter, it's
over, congratulations, Bert.

40:30.428 --> 40:33.779
Your star will
soon rise, nephew,

40:33.822 --> 40:35.781
to heights unimaginable.

40:35.824 --> 40:38.436
- Sweet, I can't
wait, Uncle Ron.

40:38.479 --> 40:40.655
- Mr. Hollis.
- Whatever.

40:40.699 --> 40:42.440
- Thanks for the
offer, Mr. Hollis,

40:42.483 --> 40:45.486
but I'd rather compete
fair and square.

40:45.530 --> 40:47.183
I'm afraid I'll have to decline.

40:47.227 --> 40:49.403
- Decline all you want, Jumbo,

40:49.447 --> 40:52.101
your destiny is written in stone

40:52.145 --> 40:54.539
whether or not we have a--

40:54.582 --> 40:57.890
- Deal?
[Bert and Ron laugh]

41:07.987 --> 41:10.772
Hmm, I'll just show myself out.

41:10.816 --> 41:11.860
- You do that, jungle boy.

41:11.904 --> 41:14.210
- Yeah, see ya later, loser.

41:14.254 --> 41:16.299
Uh, what just happened?

41:16.343 --> 41:18.780
- You just won
that spelling bee.

41:18.824 --> 41:21.696
The business world is deeper
than you realize, nephew.

41:22.958 --> 41:24.394
There's levels to this.

41:24.438 --> 41:27.223
Needless to say, you
won't have to worry

41:27.267 --> 41:29.617
about that elephant anymore.

41:29.661 --> 41:31.663
Come morning, he'll be lucky

41:31.706 --> 41:35.841
if he remembers his
own name. [evil laughs]

41:35.884 --> 41:36.842
- Sweet.

41:40.889 --> 41:42.848
- It was so weird, you guys.

41:42.891 --> 41:45.503
No sooner did Mr.
Hollis invite me in

41:45.546 --> 41:48.593
and compliment my skills
than both him and Bert

41:48.636 --> 41:51.726
started mocking me and
laughing in my face.

41:51.770 --> 41:54.337
They basically went from
asking me to do business

41:54.381 --> 41:57.558
with them to kicking me
right back to the curb.

41:57.602 --> 41:59.429
I'm so confused!

41:59.473 --> 42:02.824
- Well, I can't think of any
better news than that, Jumbo.

42:02.868 --> 42:04.826
The thought of you in
league with the Hollises

42:04.870 --> 42:06.828
was making me physically ill.

42:06.872 --> 42:10.005
- Yikes, well,
don't worry, Weldon.

42:10.049 --> 42:13.226
The only involvement I'll
be having with the Hollises

42:13.269 --> 42:16.185
is on stage at the spelling
bee in a couple days,

42:16.229 --> 42:19.188
when I beat Bert
and claim my prize.

42:19.232 --> 42:22.148
- Nice, we'll be front
and center, Jumbo,

42:22.191 --> 42:25.717
cheering you on and watching
that cocky frog crumble.

42:25.760 --> 42:28.328
Hey, what do you say we
head back to the fair,

42:28.371 --> 42:30.199
get some falafel,
and play some games?

42:30.243 --> 42:34.029
- That sounds fun,
Weldon, but I'm bushed.

42:34.073 --> 42:38.381
It's hectic walking abound
downtown, my head's spinning.

42:38.425 --> 42:40.862
I think I'm gonna lie
down and take a nap.

42:40.906 --> 42:43.125
- You didn't have
anything to eat or drink

42:43.169 --> 42:44.910
from the Hollises,
did you Jumbo?

42:44.953 --> 42:48.957
- No, they didn't even offer
me a glass of water, why?

42:49.001 --> 42:50.916
- Oh, I was just curious.

42:50.959 --> 42:53.135
I wouldn't put it past
those jerks to try

42:53.179 --> 42:56.661
and feed you bad dates or
expired milk to make you sick

42:56.704 --> 42:58.837
and force you to miss
the spelling bee.

42:58.880 --> 43:01.883
- I wondered about that
myself as I was going there,

43:01.927 --> 43:05.931
but Hollis was so
nice, then so strange.

43:05.974 --> 43:07.715
I wonder what they
really wanted.

43:07.759 --> 43:09.717
- Maybe they were
just feeling you out,

43:09.761 --> 43:12.459
picking your brain to find
out how prepared you are,

43:12.502 --> 43:14.983
or if they could glean
any training tips.

43:15.027 --> 43:16.681
- Yeah, maybe.

43:16.724 --> 43:19.988
- The important thing is you're
back home safe and sound,

43:20.032 --> 43:22.425
and ready to resume
training for the bee.

43:22.469 --> 43:24.993
I'm gonna go back to the fair
with Weldon for a little bit.

43:25.037 --> 43:27.343
You rest, when we get back,

43:27.387 --> 43:30.564
we'll run flashcards and
quiz you on new words.

43:30.608 --> 43:34.524
- Sounds good, thanks for
being understanding, you guys.

43:34.568 --> 43:36.962
I just had to go see
what they wanted.

43:37.005 --> 43:40.879
What a waste of time and effort,
I'll never do that again.

43:40.922 --> 43:42.010
- Amen to that.

43:42.054 --> 43:44.230
- Double amen, let's go, Weldon.

43:44.273 --> 43:45.884
Sweet dreams, Jumbo.

43:45.927 --> 43:47.320
- Later guys.

43:47.363 --> 43:49.931
[playful music]

43:51.324 --> 43:53.718
- Hey, Tiny, Weldon,

43:53.761 --> 43:55.154
thank goodness you're here.

43:55.197 --> 43:57.504
I've been dealing with
that insufferable jerk,

43:57.547 --> 43:59.158
Bert Hollis, all afternoon.

43:59.201 --> 44:00.725
- Bert's back?

44:00.768 --> 44:03.510
He was being a jerk
downtown this morning,

44:03.553 --> 44:07.079
- Yeah, he and his creepy
uncle were giving Jumbo

44:07.122 --> 44:09.037
a hard time at their place.

44:09.081 --> 44:12.650
- Yeah, he's been bad mouthing
Jumbo all over the place,

44:12.693 --> 44:14.956
talking about how he's
gonna win the spelling bee

44:15.000 --> 44:17.567
and stick his prize up
that elephant's snout.

44:17.611 --> 44:20.353
- What a lowdown
frog, I hate Bert.

44:20.396 --> 44:23.312
- You're not alone,
everybody hates Bert.

44:23.356 --> 44:24.836
Watch out for him in there.

44:24.879 --> 44:26.968
He's been going up
to everyone he sees,

44:27.012 --> 44:28.230
boasting and bragging.

44:28.274 --> 44:30.015
Lots of folks are
starting to leave.

44:30.058 --> 44:32.800
- Thanks for the warning,
Albert, we'll keep an eye out.

44:32.844 --> 44:35.368
- Maybe I'll take my wing
upside his green head.

44:35.411 --> 44:37.892
- Ha, that I'd like to witness.

44:37.936 --> 44:40.895
- No fighting, Weldon,
you're too good for that.

44:40.939 --> 44:43.768
It would only sink you
down to Bert's level.

44:43.811 --> 44:45.073
- Yeah, you're right.

44:45.117 --> 44:48.468
I'm a bird, we take the
high ground naturally.

44:48.511 --> 44:51.689
Come on, Tiny, let's
find that falafel stand.

44:51.732 --> 44:54.735
- Okay, hopefully the
line's not too long.

45:00.219 --> 45:03.004
- Hey, look who we have here.

45:03.048 --> 45:05.920
Topper, a pig and a bird.

45:05.964 --> 45:09.010
He leaves the droppings,
she rolls around in 'em.

45:09.054 --> 45:11.883
- Ew, disgusting.

45:11.926 --> 45:13.928
[Topper and Bert laugh]

45:13.972 --> 45:15.974
- The only disgusting
things here

45:16.017 --> 45:18.367
are your faces, you bullies.

45:18.411 --> 45:20.369
- Yeah, why don't you
go make some friends

45:20.413 --> 45:22.154
and stop harassing everyone.

45:22.197 --> 45:26.898
- Because, birdbrain,
it's more fun to harass.

45:26.941 --> 45:30.423
- Especially when you wimps
are so easily harrassable.

45:30.466 --> 45:32.642
- That's right, I
mean look at you two.

45:33.774 --> 45:36.995
You look like farm
animals, or worse.

45:37.038 --> 45:39.911
When's the last time you
had manicures or pedicures?

45:39.954 --> 45:41.913
- When's the last time
you accomplished anything

45:41.956 --> 45:43.871
your rich uncle
didn't help you with?

45:43.915 --> 45:46.961
- There they go again,
talking about your uncle

45:47.005 --> 45:48.136
'cause they're jealous.

45:48.180 --> 45:50.443
- That's the way
it goes, Topper.

45:50.486 --> 45:52.532
The have nots hate the haves

45:52.575 --> 45:54.664
just for having what they don't.

45:54.708 --> 45:56.231
- No, everyone hates
you because you're

45:56.275 --> 45:58.146
a mean little frog, Bert.

45:58.190 --> 46:00.627
You'd have a jungle full of
friends who wouldn't care

46:00.670 --> 46:01.933
a thing about your uncle

46:01.976 --> 46:04.936
if only you were
cool, but you're not.

46:04.979 --> 46:06.807
- And you have never been.

46:06.851 --> 46:09.157
- Boo hoo, poo poo.

46:09.201 --> 46:10.985
Why don't you go try your claws

46:11.029 --> 46:13.509
at winning some stale
birdseed, fly boy.

46:13.553 --> 46:16.774
That's about the nicest thing
you can get for yourself.

46:16.817 --> 46:18.863
- Why don't you shut
up and tell your uncle

46:18.906 --> 46:20.995
to buy your dad a new lily pad?

46:21.039 --> 46:23.345
He's sinking into
the pond out there.

46:23.389 --> 46:24.564
- What did you say?

46:24.607 --> 46:26.609
- Uh, nothing.

46:26.653 --> 46:28.742
- You wanna try
me, feather face?

46:28.786 --> 46:30.483
- No, I'm against fighting.

46:30.526 --> 46:32.441
- 'Cause you don't
know how to fight.

46:32.485 --> 46:34.400
- Well...

46:34.443 --> 46:37.838
- Just leave us alone, we
came to the fair to have fun,

46:37.882 --> 46:41.015
not to argue with a couple
of jerks like you two.

46:41.059 --> 46:44.149
- Okay, piggy, we'll
leave you alone.

46:44.192 --> 46:46.804
You smell funny up close anyway.

46:46.847 --> 46:48.893
- [laughs] Gross.

46:48.936 --> 46:51.156
- Give Jumbo my regards.

46:51.199 --> 46:53.811
And if his memory
fails him, remind him

46:53.854 --> 46:56.291
that I'm the soon-to-be
spelling champ.

46:56.335 --> 46:57.771
[Bert and Topper laughs]

46:57.815 --> 46:59.817
- If his memory fails him?

46:59.860 --> 47:01.601
What's that supposed to mean?

47:01.644 --> 47:03.908
Jumbo has a great memory.

47:03.951 --> 47:06.954
- I don't know, Weldon, but
I'm worried those Hollises

47:06.998 --> 47:09.043
may have played a mean
trick on our friend.

47:09.087 --> 47:14.048
[peaceful music]
[Jumbo snores]

47:29.324 --> 47:31.283
- Okay audience, here he is,

47:31.326 --> 47:34.242
the elephant we
all know and love,

47:34.286 --> 47:36.854
the elephant with
so much potential,

47:36.897 --> 47:40.292
the elephant who, in
a fair and just world,

47:40.335 --> 47:43.164
will win this spelling
bee, hooves down.

47:43.208 --> 47:46.037
Please give a warm
jungle welcome

47:46.080 --> 47:48.517
to that intelligent
elephant, Jumbo.

47:50.780 --> 47:52.826
- Hi everybody, it's
so nice to be here.

47:52.870 --> 47:55.133
- Are you ready for
your first word, Jumbo?

47:55.176 --> 47:56.743
- Ready as I'll ever be.

47:56.786 --> 47:58.223
- Did you hear that folks?

47:58.266 --> 48:01.400
He's as ready as he'll ever be.

48:01.443 --> 48:05.970
Okay smartypants,
your word is loser.

48:06.013 --> 48:09.582
- Okay, loser,

48:09.625 --> 48:12.890
L-O-, um,

48:12.933 --> 48:14.543
- Clock's ticking, Jumbo.

48:14.587 --> 48:16.284
- I know, I know.

48:16.328 --> 48:21.246
Loser, L-O-O-S-E-R, loser.

48:22.464 --> 48:24.902
- Oh, oh my.

48:24.945 --> 48:27.861
That's terribly incorrect.

48:27.905 --> 48:28.862
That's all wrong.

48:28.906 --> 48:31.517
That's not even the same word.

48:31.560 --> 48:35.521
What a stupid mistake
that was, eh fans?

48:35.564 --> 48:38.437
- I, I'm sorry, I don't
know what happened.

48:38.480 --> 48:43.137
- That is without a
doubt the dumbest mistake

48:43.181 --> 48:46.445
anyone's ever made on
our spelling bee stage

48:46.488 --> 48:48.926
since we've been holding
jungle spelling bees.

48:48.969 --> 48:53.669
I mean S-T-O-O-P-I-D, stupid.

48:55.019 --> 48:58.500
- No, no, it's not my fault.

48:58.544 --> 49:01.460
I don't know what's wrong,
I can't think straight.

49:01.503 --> 49:03.723
I can't think.

49:03.766 --> 49:06.378
[Jumbo screams]

49:08.206 --> 49:11.252
What a nightmare, felt so real.

49:12.732 --> 49:15.213
- The annual jungle
spelling bee begins tomorrow

49:15.256 --> 49:17.563
at high noon, and
its obvious outcome

49:17.606 --> 49:20.783
is as predetermined
as one can be.

49:20.827 --> 49:23.961
When all is said and
done, you will emerge

49:24.004 --> 49:26.876
as the ultimate victor, Bert,

49:26.920 --> 49:29.879
single-handedly
crushing the competition

49:29.923 --> 49:32.360
in your webbed fist.

49:32.404 --> 49:35.015
When that elephant wakes
up tomorrow morning

49:35.059 --> 49:37.670
and tries to think of
the simplest thing,

49:37.713 --> 49:41.891
he'll find his big brain
has turned to mush.

49:41.935 --> 49:46.157
His mind will be rendered
completely useless.

49:46.200 --> 49:49.725
Just think of it, nephew,
the marketing opportunities.

49:49.769 --> 49:52.424
Bert dolls, Bert cereal boxes.

49:52.467 --> 49:57.429
Bert t-shirts, Bert's debut
rap record. [evil laughs]

50:03.957 --> 50:07.308
- But Jumbo, it's
us, your best friends

50:07.352 --> 50:10.616
in the whole jungle, we've
known each other forever.

50:10.659 --> 50:11.921
- What?

50:11.965 --> 50:14.098
I've never seen
you two in my life.

50:14.141 --> 50:15.447
What are your names again?

50:15.490 --> 50:17.623
- It's me, Tiny.

50:17.666 --> 50:19.581
- And me, Weldon.

50:20.887 --> 50:23.150
- That's not ringing
a bell you guys.

50:23.194 --> 50:25.979
- Oh no, this is terrible.

50:26.023 --> 50:29.896
I know the Hollises are somehow
behind this, I just know it.

50:29.939 --> 50:31.332
- The Hollises?

50:31.376 --> 50:33.595
Now, that sounds familiar.

50:33.639 --> 50:36.772
- He remember the
Hollises, but not us?

50:36.816 --> 50:37.991
This is crazy.

50:38.035 --> 50:39.862
- Something's not right.

50:39.906 --> 50:43.518
This reeks of that
word doctor, Magnus.

50:43.562 --> 50:44.911
I'm gonna go talk to him.

50:44.954 --> 50:46.304
- Who's Magnus?

50:46.347 --> 50:48.784
I do not know you.

50:48.828 --> 50:50.873
- Maybe we should
go talk to Magnus.

50:50.917 --> 50:52.353
- Right away.

50:52.397 --> 50:55.530
We'll be back soon, Jumbo,
just take it easy and relax.

50:55.574 --> 50:57.924
- If you two don't get
out of here right now,

50:57.967 --> 50:59.969
I'm calling the jungle patrol.

51:00.013 --> 51:01.667
- Yikes, go, go!

51:01.710 --> 51:04.191
[somber music]

51:12.417 --> 51:15.115
- Hello, Mr. Magnus,
sorry to intrude.

51:15.159 --> 51:17.596
- We come in peace.

51:17.639 --> 51:19.076
- That's too bad.

51:19.119 --> 51:21.861
I was looking forward to a
knockdown, drag-out brawl.

51:21.904 --> 51:24.385
- Not me, I'm a peaceful bird.

51:24.429 --> 51:26.083
- Hmph, too bad.

51:26.126 --> 51:28.650
- Magnus, we're here to
ask you about our friend,

51:28.694 --> 51:30.043
Jumbo the elephant.

51:30.087 --> 51:31.305
- What about him?

51:31.349 --> 51:33.916
- Well, he's not himself.

51:33.960 --> 51:36.745
- Sounds like an
identity crisis,

51:36.789 --> 51:38.095
lots of elephants get 'em.

51:38.138 --> 51:41.010
- Yeah, but this is
particularly bad.

51:41.054 --> 51:43.839
We spoke with him earlier
and everything was fine,

51:43.883 --> 51:45.798
then he laid down for a nap,

51:45.841 --> 51:48.583
and when he woke up,
he didn't remember us.

51:48.627 --> 51:51.804
- That's right, he doesn't
even know who we are.

51:51.847 --> 51:53.545
- Now that you
come to mention it,

51:53.588 --> 51:55.329
I don't know who you are.

51:55.373 --> 51:56.983
Who are you?

51:57.026 --> 51:58.811
- My name's Tiny, and
this is my friend Weldon.

51:58.854 --> 52:01.553
- What do you want from
me, Tiny and Weldon?

52:01.596 --> 52:04.817
- Answers, do you
have anything to do

52:04.860 --> 52:06.819
with our friend's memory loss?

52:06.862 --> 52:11.345
- Me, why would I bother myself
with some jungle elephant?

52:11.389 --> 52:14.479
- Maybe because Ron
Hollis offered you a deal.

52:14.522 --> 52:17.569
- Ron Hollis, the
amphibian swindler?

52:17.612 --> 52:20.354
I only do business with
reputable animals, my dear.

52:21.573 --> 52:23.401
You're oinking under
the wrong tree.

52:23.444 --> 52:26.882
- Please, Magnus, did you
at least hear about this?

52:26.926 --> 52:29.363
Can you tell us anything?

52:29.407 --> 52:30.147
- 'Fraid not, bacon.

52:30.190 --> 52:31.844
- Let's go, Tiny.

52:31.887 --> 52:34.847
After what Hollis did, only
a fool would deal with him.

52:34.890 --> 52:37.066
- Wait a second, hold on.

52:38.372 --> 52:40.896
What exactly did Hollis
do that would render one

52:40.940 --> 52:42.811
foolish for dealing with him?

52:42.855 --> 52:43.638
- Um.

52:45.597 --> 52:49.514
- Like you don't know, everyone
knows by now, right Tiny?

52:49.557 --> 52:52.430
- That's right.

52:52.473 --> 52:53.909
Everyone knows about it.

52:53.953 --> 52:57.739
- Well, I seem to be feeling
a big forgetful myself.

52:57.783 --> 53:00.220
Why don't you two
refresh my memory?

53:00.264 --> 53:03.615
- Oh, okay, go ahead
and tell him, Weldon.

53:03.658 --> 53:05.051
What could it hurt now?

53:05.094 --> 53:08.794
- That's true, what's done
is done, and fortunately.

53:08.837 --> 53:12.580
Hollis bought up acres and
acres of our protected land

53:12.624 --> 53:14.582
for his city company to develop.

53:14.626 --> 53:15.409
- He what?

53:15.453 --> 53:16.889
- That's right.

53:16.932 --> 53:19.892
He plans to build strip
mall after strip mall

53:19.935 --> 53:22.286
right here where we're standing.

53:22.329 --> 53:24.418
This part of the jungle
might've been peaceful

53:24.462 --> 53:28.248
up to now, but all
that's about to change,

53:28.292 --> 53:30.903
and this habitat will
be destroyed forever.

53:30.946 --> 53:33.427
- Bunk, I've heard
nothing of the sort.

53:33.471 --> 53:36.952
- That's because it's all off
the books and under the table.

53:36.996 --> 53:39.999
- Hollis knows what
he's doing is illegal,

53:40.042 --> 53:42.480
but he's not about
to be stopped,

53:42.523 --> 53:44.438
until it's too late, of course.

53:45.352 --> 53:46.701
- The monster.

53:46.745 --> 53:48.094
- That's what we said.

53:48.137 --> 53:51.880
- Yeah, we said exactly
that, the monster.

53:51.924 --> 53:54.840
- Come on, Tiny, we'll
keep asking around.

53:54.883 --> 53:56.668
Thanks for your time, Magnus.

53:56.711 --> 53:57.930
We're sorry to bother you.

53:57.973 --> 53:59.888
- Hold on a second, you two.

53:59.932 --> 54:03.196
You're right, Hollis
offered me a deal

54:03.240 --> 54:06.634
in exchange for casting
a curse that would erase

54:06.678 --> 54:08.636
Jumbo's memory before
the spelling bee.

54:08.680 --> 54:10.725
- [gasps] You cad.

54:10.769 --> 54:12.379
How could you?

54:12.423 --> 54:14.207
- I'm starving out
here, that's how.

54:14.251 --> 54:17.689
- But Jumbo's never said a
cross word to you, Magnus.

54:17.732 --> 54:19.081
He'd never hurt a fly.

54:19.125 --> 54:20.909
Why would you do this to him?

54:20.953 --> 54:22.998
Can you reverse
the curse on Jumbo?

54:23.042 --> 54:24.304
- No.
- Oh.

54:24.348 --> 54:26.915
- I don't do junk magic, piggy.

54:26.959 --> 54:29.918
My curses are the real
deal, irreversible.

54:29.962 --> 54:32.486
However, it can be
countered with dedicated

54:32.530 --> 54:35.924
memory exercises taught
by a master only.

54:35.968 --> 54:38.144
- Oh great, where in the jungle

54:38.187 --> 54:40.712
will we ever find
a memory master?

54:40.755 --> 54:43.410
[dramatic music]

54:49.460 --> 54:52.376
- So you see, Jumbo,
we just have to find

54:52.419 --> 54:54.943
some smartypants somewhere
who can guide you

54:54.987 --> 54:57.337
through some
specialized exercises

54:57.381 --> 54:58.991
to restore your memory.

54:59.034 --> 55:00.819
- Yeah, easy, right?

55:00.862 --> 55:02.821
- I don't know, you guys.

55:02.864 --> 55:04.953
I'll take your word
for it that you know me

55:04.997 --> 55:06.738
and we're good friends and all,

55:06.781 --> 55:09.828
but I just don't
remember anything.

55:10.959 --> 55:12.613
What did you call me?

55:12.657 --> 55:13.788
What's my name again?

55:13.832 --> 55:14.833
- Jumbo.
- Jumbo.

55:14.876 --> 55:16.748
- Ah, right.

55:16.791 --> 55:18.837
- Listen, we have
to keep trying.

55:18.880 --> 55:21.579
If we don't at least
try, we're sure to fail,

55:21.622 --> 55:24.277
and all the good times
and the laughs we've had

55:24.321 --> 55:25.844
will be lost forever.

55:25.887 --> 55:27.585
And I don't know about you guys,

55:27.628 --> 55:30.109
but I am not willing
to let that go.

55:30.152 --> 55:33.460
I love you, Jumbo, we all do,

55:33.504 --> 55:34.896
and we want you to get on stage

55:34.940 --> 55:38.770
in that spelling bee and
win it like we know you can.

55:38.813 --> 55:42.034
But most importantly,
we want our friend back.

55:42.077 --> 55:45.516
Can we just give it
our best shot, please?

55:45.559 --> 55:47.822
- Oh, sure, why not?

55:47.866 --> 55:50.042
- Yay!
- Yay!

55:50.085 --> 55:52.653
- What are you guys
so happy about?

55:52.697 --> 55:55.743
- I have no idea,
I really don't.

55:55.787 --> 55:56.483
Who are you?

55:56.527 --> 55:58.485
- Ha, ha, very funny.

55:58.529 --> 56:00.922
- No, really, who are you?

56:00.966 --> 56:04.273
- We're having an absolutely
dreadful day, Emmett.

56:04.317 --> 56:05.666
- The worst.

56:05.710 --> 56:06.754
What's up, buddy?

56:06.798 --> 56:08.626
- You guys are weird, man.

56:08.669 --> 56:11.411
- I know, right,
straight up cuckoo.

56:11.455 --> 56:13.892
- Wanna hear a story you
won't believe, Emmett?

56:13.935 --> 56:17.374
- Uh, why would I want to
hear it if I won't believe it?

56:17.417 --> 56:20.899
- Because it's so crazy
somebody should write it down

56:20.942 --> 56:23.118
and make a movie out
of it or something.

56:23.162 --> 56:25.164
- It'd make a great
cartoon, for sure.

56:25.207 --> 56:27.993
- Okay, fine, you tell me yours,

56:28.036 --> 56:29.647
then I'll tell you mine.

56:29.690 --> 56:31.910
We'll see whose is crazier.

56:31.953 --> 56:33.825
- You have a wild story, too.

56:33.868 --> 56:36.523
- Sure do, and it's all true.

56:36.567 --> 56:38.003
- What's it about?

56:38.046 --> 56:42.224
- It's about a million-year-old
dinosaur named Big T,

56:42.268 --> 56:44.618
who lives deep in the jungle,

56:44.662 --> 56:49.536
and has a memory that goes
back as far as time itself.

56:50.798 --> 56:52.147
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

56:52.191 --> 56:54.889
- He tells the future and
does ninja mind tricks,

56:54.933 --> 56:58.371
and anyone who finds him
comes away enlightened

56:58.415 --> 57:00.460
with deeper memory
and understanding

57:00.504 --> 57:03.768
than they ever had
before, ha, ha, ha, ha.

57:03.811 --> 57:05.683
- Wow, sounds wild.

57:05.726 --> 57:07.598
- Yeah, sure does.

57:13.299 --> 57:16.563
- I'm telling you
this is a sign, guys.

57:16.607 --> 57:18.957
What are the odds that
Emmett would know exactly

57:19.000 --> 57:20.306
the creature we need to talk to

57:20.349 --> 57:22.917
at exactly the time we
need to talk to him.

57:22.961 --> 57:26.878
- Astronomical at best,
and if this Big T is real,

57:26.921 --> 57:31.230
he's the one who can restore
Jumbo's memory, no doubt.

57:31.273 --> 57:33.188
We've gotta find him and fast,

57:33.232 --> 57:34.929
everything depends on it.

57:34.973 --> 57:37.149
- I don't know you guys, I mean,

57:37.192 --> 57:39.891
how do we find a
reclusive ancient dinosaur

57:39.934 --> 57:41.632
who doesn't wanna be found?

57:41.675 --> 57:44.765
Do we just, like, throw
out a slab of meat

57:44.809 --> 57:49.770
and call, here dinosaur,
dinosaur, dinosaur, or what?

57:50.815 --> 57:54.383
- Hmm, that's not a bad idea.

57:54.427 --> 57:56.908
But, we don't even
have any bait.

57:56.951 --> 57:58.736
- Unless we count Tiny

57:58.779 --> 58:00.651
- [gulps] You do
believe me that we're

58:00.694 --> 58:02.479
best friends, right Jumbo?

58:02.522 --> 58:03.871
- I'm taking your word for it.

58:03.915 --> 58:06.874
You've both been totally
nice to me so far.

58:06.918 --> 58:09.790
If nothing else, we can
be new besties for sure.

58:09.834 --> 58:11.052
- Whew.

58:11.096 --> 58:13.968
- Come on you guys, the
jungle's getting denser,

58:14.012 --> 58:16.057
if there is an old
dinosaur out here,

58:16.101 --> 58:19.670
this is looking more and
more like his kind of turf.

58:19.713 --> 58:22.194
[upbeat music]

58:24.979 --> 58:26.546
[crowd cheers]

58:26.590 --> 58:29.897
- Attention, ladies, gentlemen,
and animals of all stripes,

58:29.941 --> 58:34.249
spots, and hides,
come one, come all.

58:34.293 --> 58:36.774
- Wait, are you
carny barking now?

58:36.817 --> 58:38.645
I thought this was my job.

58:38.689 --> 58:41.909
- Shut up, Albert, this is
important, let my uncle talk.

58:41.953 --> 58:44.303
- Here's your chance
to meet the frog

58:44.346 --> 58:49.003
before he was famous,
and I mean, just before.

58:49.047 --> 58:53.094
Come, shake the webbed
hand of Bert Hollis,

58:53.138 --> 58:57.751
future spelling bee champion
of the entire animal kingdom.

58:57.795 --> 59:01.276
Bert's never misspelled
a word in his whole life.

59:01.320 --> 59:03.757
And spoiler alert,
ladies and gents,

59:03.801 --> 59:05.933
he's not about to start now.

59:05.977 --> 59:06.891
- Oh boy.

59:06.934 --> 59:09.067
- Yeah, you tell 'em, Uncle Ron.

59:09.110 --> 59:11.852
- That's Mr. Hollis
to you, nephew.

59:11.896 --> 59:16.248
Come say hi to future
legend Bert Hollis,

59:16.291 --> 59:19.991
live and in the flesh,
right here, right now.

59:20.034 --> 59:22.471
Don't let this opportunity
pass you by, kids.

59:24.038 --> 59:26.084
Bert's soon to be
a household name.

59:26.127 --> 59:29.566
- You hear that,
Albert, household name.

59:29.609 --> 59:32.046
Forget Siri, when folks
wanna know the answers

59:32.090 --> 59:35.746
to life's mysteries from now
on, they'll call on Bert.

59:35.789 --> 59:36.877
- How impressive.

59:36.921 --> 59:38.487
- Darned right.

59:38.531 --> 59:42.404
- And you all know me,
I am Mr. Ron Hollis,

59:42.448 --> 59:44.276
Bert's beloved uncle.

59:44.319 --> 59:46.583
- Uh, like uncle, like nephew.

59:47.453 --> 59:48.715
[Big T distantly growls]

59:48.759 --> 59:50.456
- Did you hear that, Tiny?

59:50.499 --> 59:51.762
- Hear what?

59:51.805 --> 59:55.722
- That sounds like
a dinosaur lurking.

59:55.766 --> 59:57.289
- Can Weldon still see us?

59:57.332 --> 59:59.378
- I don't know, let me look.

1:00:05.384 --> 1:00:08.387
- The coast is clear,
you guys, keep going.

1:00:09.910 --> 1:00:14.611
Wow, look at that view from
up here, it's majestic.

1:00:15.829 --> 1:00:17.875
Boy, do I spend too
much time on the ground.

1:00:17.918 --> 1:00:20.312
- Do you still hear
something, Jumbo?

1:00:20.355 --> 1:00:23.968
- Thought I heard something
breathing, something big.

1:00:24.011 --> 1:00:26.361
- It's probably just
the wind in the trees.

1:00:26.405 --> 1:00:28.494
[Big T growls]

1:00:28.537 --> 1:00:31.453
[Jumbo and Tiny scream]

1:00:31.497 --> 1:00:36.458
- Wow, look out, dinosaur
at 12 o'clock, dinosaur.

1:00:37.721 --> 1:00:39.548
- Who dares disturb
my serene slumber?

1:00:39.592 --> 1:00:41.246
- We do, Big t.

1:00:41.289 --> 1:00:43.335
- Who's we, morsel?

1:00:43.378 --> 1:00:48.079
- Oh, wow, I've never been
called a morsel before.

1:00:48.122 --> 1:00:49.428
I feel funny.

1:00:49.471 --> 1:00:51.822
- Please, Mr. T,
don't harm my friends.

1:00:51.865 --> 1:00:55.782
- Aw, Jumbo, you
called us your friends.

1:00:55.826 --> 1:00:59.917
- One thing right now,
do not call me Mr. T.

1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:03.529
It's Big T, got it? [roars]

1:01:06.967 --> 1:01:09.883
- Yes, I got it, Big T, sir.

1:01:09.927 --> 1:01:14.888
- Hey, you leave my friends
alone you big, ugly,

1:01:15.584 --> 1:01:16.803
oh, whoa, [gulp].

1:01:18.979 --> 1:01:20.807
- We don't mean to
bother you, Big T,

1:01:20.851 --> 1:01:23.549
but a friend of ours said
you might be able to help us.

1:01:23.592 --> 1:01:26.247
- A friend of yours told
you of my existence?

1:01:26.291 --> 1:01:29.773
- Yes, and that you're
very old and wise.

1:01:29.816 --> 1:01:30.817
- Old?

1:01:30.861 --> 1:01:33.602
Tell me, do I look old, morsel?

1:01:33.646 --> 1:01:35.866
- See, it still
makes me feel funny.

1:01:35.909 --> 1:01:39.957
- No, you don't look a
day over a half million.

1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:41.698
- Oh, really?

1:01:41.741 --> 1:01:45.832
Well, I'm liking you three
more and more, go on.

1:01:45.876 --> 1:01:49.706
- Mr. Big T, uh,

1:01:49.749 --> 1:01:51.577
I'm afraid my good
friends here have put

1:01:51.620 --> 1:01:54.014
themselves in
danger today for me.

1:01:54.058 --> 1:01:55.450
I'm the one who needs help,

1:01:55.494 --> 1:01:57.975
and they're only trying
to find it for me.

1:01:58.018 --> 1:02:00.847
If you're angry, please
don't take it out on them,

1:02:00.891 --> 1:02:03.328
it's alL my fault that
we've disturbed you.

1:02:03.371 --> 1:02:06.461
And I'd like to start
by saying, we're sorry.

1:02:06.505 --> 1:02:07.245
- Go on.

1:02:08.507 --> 1:02:10.857
- My name's Jumbo and
I'm set to compete

1:02:10.901 --> 1:02:13.991
in today's, wow, is it today?

1:02:14.034 --> 1:02:15.557
- In about an hour.

1:02:15.601 --> 1:02:17.864
- I'm competing in today's
jungle spelling bee,

1:02:17.908 --> 1:02:19.779
and I'm a really good speller.

1:02:19.823 --> 1:02:22.086
- He's, like, the best.

1:02:22.129 --> 1:02:24.044
- He was totally gonna win.

1:02:24.088 --> 1:02:27.134
- Anyway, another contestant's
uncle struck a deal

1:02:27.178 --> 1:02:29.658
with the jungle word
doctor and completely

1:02:29.702 --> 1:02:31.182
erased my memory.

1:02:31.225 --> 1:02:32.749
- Wiped it clean.

1:02:32.792 --> 1:02:35.229
- He can't even spell
his name, Big T.

1:02:35.273 --> 1:02:38.798
- I see, you're as
dumb as riverbank moss.

1:02:39.799 --> 1:02:42.976
- Yeah, so, anyway, our friend,

1:02:43.020 --> 1:02:45.892
- Who he also doesn't remember.

1:02:45.936 --> 1:02:48.677
- Yeah, nada, so
our friend told us

1:02:48.721 --> 1:02:51.332
there's an ancient dinosaur
who lives deep in the jungle

1:02:51.376 --> 1:02:53.944
with a memory as
old as time itself.

1:02:53.987 --> 1:02:55.510
- At your service.

1:02:55.554 --> 1:02:58.862
- Yeah, and that
you could maybe,

1:02:58.905 --> 1:03:02.779
if you were so inclined
and feeling gracious,

1:03:02.822 --> 1:03:05.390
maybe, you know,

1:03:05.433 --> 1:03:07.261
- Gobble you up in one bite

1:03:07.305 --> 1:03:09.394
and not spill a
drop on the ground?

1:03:09.437 --> 1:03:11.048
- Yikes, we're finished.

1:03:11.091 --> 1:03:13.398
- Well, ideally no.

1:03:13.441 --> 1:03:17.445
- Mmhmm, lucky for you
lot, I already had lunch.

1:03:17.489 --> 1:03:19.970
- [sigh] You have, whew.

1:03:20.013 --> 1:03:21.710
- Tell me, morsels.

1:03:21.754 --> 1:03:22.799
- So, so funny.

1:03:24.888 --> 1:03:27.455
- What is the name of this
fellow competitor's uncle?

1:03:27.499 --> 1:03:29.370
- It's Ron Hollis, sir.

1:03:29.414 --> 1:03:31.808
[Big T roars]

1:03:35.028 --> 1:03:35.812
- Ron Hollis?

1:03:35.855 --> 1:03:38.597
I hate Ron Hollis.

1:03:38.640 --> 1:03:40.077
- You, you do?

1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:42.862
- Yes, ever since
that dastardly frog

1:03:42.906 --> 1:03:45.038
tried painting and
selling dinosaur eggs

1:03:45.082 --> 1:03:47.649
to turn a buck during Easter,

1:03:47.693 --> 1:03:49.956
I've counted him among
my moral enemies.

1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:51.653
- How despicable.

1:03:51.697 --> 1:03:54.134
- Anything I can do
to help you, I shall

1:03:54.178 --> 1:03:56.789
if it works against
Hollis in any way.

1:03:56.833 --> 1:03:59.923
- Can you restore
Jumbo's memory, Big T?

1:03:59.966 --> 1:04:01.838
- I can indeed.

1:04:01.881 --> 1:04:03.927
If you could win that
spelling bee and ensure

1:04:03.970 --> 1:04:05.972
that any member of
the Hollis's bloodline

1:04:06.016 --> 1:04:08.888
tastes nothing but bitter
defeat for eternity.

1:04:08.932 --> 1:04:11.848
- Now that sounds like
a good deal to me.

1:04:11.891 --> 1:04:14.372
- Yes, Jumbo, say yes.

1:04:14.415 --> 1:04:18.158
- Yes, if you can grant
me my memory, Big T,

1:04:18.202 --> 1:04:21.901
I promise I'll go win that
spelling bee like a boss.

1:04:21.945 --> 1:04:24.512
- Very well, repeat after me.

1:04:25.774 --> 1:04:28.255
- Amidst the mists
and fiercest frost,

1:04:28.299 --> 1:04:31.389
with barest wrist
and stoutest boast,

1:04:31.432 --> 1:04:33.782
he thrusts his fists
against the posts,

1:04:33.826 --> 1:04:37.177
and still insists
he sees the ghosts.

1:04:37.221 --> 1:04:39.788
- Amidst the mists
and fiercest frost,

1:04:39.832 --> 1:04:42.922
with barest wrist
and stoutest boast,

1:04:42.966 --> 1:04:45.969
he thrusts his fists
against the posts,

1:04:46.012 --> 1:04:48.841
and still insists
he sees the ghosts.

1:04:48.885 --> 1:04:51.975
- Good, now let's go over
some history lessons.

1:04:52.018 --> 1:04:53.759
- History lessons?

1:04:53.802 --> 1:04:56.022
Okay, starting from?

1:04:56.066 --> 1:04:57.894
- From the beginning.

1:04:57.937 --> 1:05:00.635
First, there was a big bang.

1:05:00.679 --> 1:05:02.855
- Oh no, we're
gonna miss the bee.

1:05:02.899 --> 1:05:07.904
[crowd cheers]
[triumphant music]

1:05:11.559 --> 1:05:12.821
- This is it everybody.

1:05:12.865 --> 1:05:15.085
Welcome one and
all to the platform

1:05:15.128 --> 1:05:18.523
upon which dreams are made,
and some dreams broken.

1:05:18.566 --> 1:05:21.178
Yes, indeed, it's
time once again

1:05:21.221 --> 1:05:24.181
for the annual
jungle spelling bee.

1:05:24.224 --> 1:05:26.792
Without further ado,
allow me to introduce

1:05:26.835 --> 1:05:28.925
this year's contestants,

1:05:28.968 --> 1:05:31.753
an illustrious, if motley,
crew of the animal kingdom's

1:05:31.797 --> 1:05:33.538
most skilled wordsmiths.

1:05:33.581 --> 1:05:36.584
Indeed, this group
is already the best,

1:05:36.628 --> 1:05:40.240
and after today, we'll know
who's the best of the best.

1:05:40.284 --> 1:05:42.808
- Ha, just crown me now.

1:05:42.851 --> 1:05:45.898
- Just a reminder, as
always, today's contest

1:05:45.942 --> 1:05:47.813
is a single-elimination
tournament

1:05:47.856 --> 1:05:50.511
to crown the best
speller in our land.

1:05:50.555 --> 1:05:55.255
That means your first mistake
is also your last mistake.

1:05:55.299 --> 1:05:58.389
And now, our
contestants, first up,

1:05:58.432 --> 1:06:00.739
welcome back that
masterful maestro

1:06:00.782 --> 1:06:03.785
of the manuscript, Topper.

1:06:03.829 --> 1:06:08.051
And next, the most adroit
alphabeteer, Rhonda.

1:06:09.269 --> 1:06:13.230
Thirdly, that brilliant
bookworm, Harper.

1:06:13.273 --> 1:06:14.753
And, and,

1:06:15.972 --> 1:06:20.585
last but certainly
not least, Bert.

1:06:20.628 --> 1:06:22.761
- That's it, just Bert?

1:06:22.804 --> 1:06:26.330
- We, uh, we seem to
be missing someone.

1:06:26.373 --> 1:06:29.202
- Nope, not missing anybody,
chop, chop, let's do this.

1:06:29.246 --> 1:06:30.377
First word, go.

1:06:30.421 --> 1:06:32.640
- We're one member short.

1:06:32.684 --> 1:06:37.602
Oh dear, I was so looking
forward to his performance, too.

1:06:38.342 --> 1:06:39.734
- Well, you got me.

1:06:39.778 --> 1:06:41.823
Let me show you what I can do.

1:06:43.086 --> 1:06:45.784
Yeah, I'll show you
some real skills.

1:06:45.827 --> 1:06:47.786
- Sorry I'm late everybody.

1:06:47.829 --> 1:06:50.789
- Here he is, by the
skin of his trunk,

1:06:50.832 --> 1:06:55.054
that most experienced
elephant elocutionist, Jumbo.

1:06:56.490 --> 1:06:57.839
- Deja vu.

1:06:57.883 --> 1:06:59.319
- What are you, lost?

1:06:59.363 --> 1:07:02.496
Scram, elephant, the
peanut trough's that way.

1:07:02.540 --> 1:07:05.717
- Oh, I'm not lost, Bert,
I'm right where I belong.

1:07:05.760 --> 1:07:07.762
It's you who are in trouble.

1:07:07.806 --> 1:07:09.851
- We'll see about that, chump.

1:07:09.895 --> 1:07:12.115
- First word goes to Topper.

1:07:12.158 --> 1:07:16.075
Topper, the word is supersede.

1:07:16.119 --> 1:07:19.165
- Ha, give me a hard
one, why don't ya.

1:07:19.209 --> 1:07:24.170
Supersede,
S-U-P-E-R-C-E-D-E, supersede.

1:07:26.651 --> 1:07:27.869
Boomstick, oo-ah.

1:07:29.393 --> 1:07:31.395
- I'm very sorry, Topper,

1:07:31.438 --> 1:07:33.745
but that is incorrect.

1:07:33.788 --> 1:07:35.964
- What, no?

1:07:36.008 --> 1:07:38.924
On my first word, no.

1:07:38.967 --> 1:07:43.929
- The correct spelling
is S-U-P-E-R-S-E-D-E.

1:07:48.064 --> 1:07:50.892
Please, exit the
stage, good sir,

1:07:50.936 --> 1:07:52.938
and we hope to
see you next year.

1:07:52.981 --> 1:07:55.288
- Yeah, you'll see
me after the show

1:07:55.332 --> 1:07:57.203
if you ain't careful, pal.

1:07:57.247 --> 1:08:00.641
- Well, as security makes
their way to the front,

1:08:00.685 --> 1:08:02.948
the next word goes to Rhonda.

1:08:02.991 --> 1:08:05.429
- [Topper] Get your
hands off of me.

1:08:05.472 --> 1:08:08.258
I said get off of me.

1:08:08.301 --> 1:08:12.392
- Rhonda, the word is liaison.

1:08:12.436 --> 1:08:15.134
- Phew, okay, liaison,

1:08:16.440 --> 1:08:21.097
L-I-A-S-O-N, liaison.

1:08:23.099 --> 1:08:24.839
[crowd sighs]
[gasp] Oh no.

1:08:24.883 --> 1:08:29.322
- I'm so sorry, Rhonda, but,
as you may have surmised,

1:08:29.366 --> 1:08:31.368
that is incorrect.

1:08:31.411 --> 1:08:36.373
The proper spelling of
liaison is L-I-A-I-S-O-N.

1:08:39.854 --> 1:08:41.508
We do hope to see you again.

1:08:42.857 --> 1:08:44.903
Next word is for Harper.

1:08:44.946 --> 1:08:48.341
Harper, the word is accordion.

1:08:48.385 --> 1:08:53.303
- Got it, in fact, I have
one at home, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1:08:54.217 --> 1:08:56.393
- Shocker.
- Accordion,

1:08:56.436 --> 1:09:01.398
A-C-C-O-R-D-I-A-N, accordion.

1:09:05.141 --> 1:09:08.405
[crowd sighs]
Oh, I know, I know.

1:09:08.448 --> 1:09:11.930
- I'm very, very sorry, Harper.

1:09:11.973 --> 1:09:13.758
- Can I spell it right?

1:09:13.801 --> 1:09:16.630
Just for my own
piece of mind, sir.

1:09:17.718 --> 1:09:19.067
I'm moving after the summer,

1:09:19.111 --> 1:09:21.505
and this was my
final spelling bee.

1:09:21.548 --> 1:09:22.941
- Beat it, you bum.

1:09:22.984 --> 1:09:26.118
- Let him go out on a win,
Bert, what do you care?

1:09:26.162 --> 1:09:28.164
- I'll let you go
out on a gurney

1:09:28.207 --> 1:09:29.948
if you don't zip it, nosy.

1:09:29.991 --> 1:09:32.037
- Okay, Harper, okay.

1:09:32.080 --> 1:09:34.822
The judges have conferred,
and you may take

1:09:34.866 --> 1:09:38.435
one more, out-of-competition
crack at the word.

1:09:38.478 --> 1:09:40.480
The floor is yours, my friend.

1:09:40.524 --> 1:09:43.962
[Harper breathes deeply]

1:09:44.005 --> 1:09:48.967
- A-C-C-O-R-D-I-O-N, accordion.

1:09:53.406 --> 1:09:56.409
- Correct,
congratulations, Harper,

1:09:56.453 --> 1:09:57.802
and happy trails to you.

1:09:57.845 --> 1:10:00.413
We hope to see
you again someday.

1:10:00.457 --> 1:10:03.895
- Thanks everybody,
it's been a blast.

1:10:03.938 --> 1:10:05.897
- Move it out, move
it out, move it out.

1:10:05.940 --> 1:10:08.247
- Oh my, we're down to our final

1:10:08.291 --> 1:10:10.684
two contestants that quickly.

1:10:10.728 --> 1:10:12.730
And here we go.

1:10:12.773 --> 1:10:16.429
Bert, this next word
is yours, ambidextrous.

1:10:17.952 --> 1:10:20.868
- Ha, you're gonna have to
get up earlier in the morning

1:10:20.912 --> 1:10:22.261
to stump me, chief.

1:10:23.393 --> 1:10:26.613
A-M-B-I-D-E-X-T-R-O-U-S,
ambidextrous.

1:10:27.745 --> 1:10:28.528
- Correct.

1:10:29.834 --> 1:10:31.227
Jumbo, here we go.

1:10:32.750 --> 1:10:35.796
The word is isthmus.

1:10:35.840 --> 1:10:37.711
- Ooh, okay.

1:10:38.886 --> 1:10:40.888
Isthmus,
- Don't screw it up.

1:10:40.932 --> 1:10:45.893
- I-S-T-H-M-U-S, isthmus.

1:10:46.851 --> 1:10:48.200
- That is correct.

1:10:49.419 --> 1:10:52.509
And also, the first
winning pair of the day,

1:10:52.552 --> 1:10:56.469
you know what this means
everybody, it's a shootout.

1:10:56.513 --> 1:10:58.515
- Bang, bang, you're dead.

1:10:58.558 --> 1:11:00.256
- Take your best shot, Bert.

1:11:00.299 --> 1:11:01.518
- Your turn, Bert,

1:11:01.561 --> 1:11:03.911
and the word is limousine.

1:11:03.955 --> 1:11:06.044
- Yeah, my favorite ride.

1:11:06.087 --> 1:11:08.046
Matter of fact,
my uncle's got one

1:11:08.089 --> 1:11:10.396
waiting for me right outside.

1:11:10.440 --> 1:11:12.485
We're taking it to my
first autograph signing

1:11:12.529 --> 1:11:14.270
tonight at Macaque Motors.

1:11:14.313 --> 1:11:16.750
Everybody who didn't meet
me before the show today

1:11:16.794 --> 1:11:19.362
is invited, but bring your cash,

1:11:19.405 --> 1:11:21.581
'cause my signature's
not free anymore.

1:11:22.800 --> 1:11:24.062
What was that word again?

1:11:24.105 --> 1:11:26.630
- The word is limousine, Bert.

1:11:26.673 --> 1:11:29.067
- Oh yeah, limousine,

1:11:29.110 --> 1:11:33.941
L-I-M-O-S-I-N-E,
limousine, woohoo, boom,

1:11:34.986 --> 1:11:37.510
I never miss baby, never.

1:11:37.554 --> 1:11:39.947
- I'm very happy, I mean,

1:11:39.991 --> 1:11:44.952
sorry to say this, Bert,
but that is incorrect.

1:11:45.866 --> 1:11:47.172
- Wait, what?

1:11:47.215 --> 1:11:49.522
- And that means
you are disqualified

1:11:49.566 --> 1:11:50.828
from the spelling bee.

1:11:50.871 --> 1:11:52.873
Please, exit the stage, chief.

1:11:52.917 --> 1:11:55.572
- Wait, no, that can't be.

1:11:55.615 --> 1:11:58.662
Limousine, I spelled
it, I spelled it right.

1:11:58.705 --> 1:12:00.838
I want a replay,
Uncle Ron, Uncle Ron?!

1:12:02.448 --> 1:12:04.929
- [Emcee] Security, if you'll
see the contestant out.

1:12:04.972 --> 1:12:06.322
- [Bert] Don't touch me.

1:12:06.365 --> 1:12:08.628
I'm going, I'm going

1:12:08.672 --> 1:12:10.238
Uncle Ron!

1:12:10.282 --> 1:12:14.547
- Well, Jumbo, you're
the last animal standing.

1:12:14.591 --> 1:12:17.202
The next correct spelling wins,

1:12:17.245 --> 1:12:19.813
are you ready for
your next word?

1:12:19.857 --> 1:12:21.511
- I am, sir.

1:12:21.554 --> 1:12:25.645
- Okay, and Jumbo,
congratulations.

1:12:25.689 --> 1:12:26.951
- Thank you, sir.

1:12:26.994 --> 1:12:31.651
- The next word
is Tyrannosaurus.

1:12:32.522 --> 1:12:34.915
- Ha, what a coincidence.

1:12:34.959 --> 1:12:36.874
- Go Jumbo!

1:12:36.917 --> 1:12:38.745
- Win it all, buddy!

1:12:38.789 --> 1:12:42.270
- You rock Jumbo,
do it for Big T!

1:12:42.314 --> 1:12:47.275
- Tyrannosaurus,
T-Y-R-A-N-N-O-S-A-U-R-U-

1:12:56.241 --> 1:12:59.897
S.
[crowd cheers]

1:12:59.940 --> 1:13:00.724
- Yay!

1:13:02.073 --> 1:13:02.856
- Woohoo!

1:13:03.814 --> 1:13:06.033
- Yes, yes, yes!

1:13:06.077 --> 1:13:06.860
- Yeah!

1:13:08.645 --> 1:13:12.039
- Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my distinct pleasure

1:13:12.083 --> 1:13:15.216
to introduce to you the
spelling bee champion

1:13:15.260 --> 1:13:16.827
of the animal kingdom, Jumbo.

1:13:19.569 --> 1:13:22.136
- I like this dream much better.

1:13:22.180 --> 1:13:24.878
[upbeat music]
