00:04.379 --> 00:05.801
Previously on "Power"...

00:05.964 --> 00:08.934
Agent Greg Knox
has caught us a very big fish.

00:09.092 --> 00:12.096
I found Vibora Ruiz.
He's agreed to testify against Lobos.

00:12.262 --> 00:13.730
Why would you
bring a gun to school?

00:13.889 --> 00:16.049
Shawn got shot so I thought
it could happen to me, too.

00:16.216 --> 00:18.059
Dad, you're not here
to protect nobody no more.

00:18.218 --> 00:19.608
I'm sorry about the gun.

00:19.770 --> 00:21.898
Maybe we pushed
the kid thing too fast.

00:22.064 --> 00:24.264
Maybe I should hang out
with the kids alone for a while.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.367
You got no clue
what you're getting yourself into.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.087
I haven't decided
if I'm keeping it yet.

00:28.237 --> 00:30.956
I really love Tommy
and I want to be a family.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.412
- I just...
- Tommy doesn't know?

00:38.121 --> 00:40.544
- Who did this to you?
- It was Lobos.

00:40.707 --> 00:43.085
Don't worry, baby.
Everything's gonna be all right.

00:43.252 --> 00:46.347
- Who's the target?
- James St. Patrick.

Tommy. You okay?

02:41.745 --> 02:45.249
This shit last night,
I can't make sense of it.

02:46.375 --> 02:49.254
Tommy, you know who it was.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.012
It was Lobos.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.219
Yeah.

02:53.382 --> 02:56.477
I thought that,
but it don't track

02:56.635 --> 02:59.315
- that he'd want to cut off his money.
- Who else would it be, then?

02:59.340 --> 03:02.107
Lobos told you
he wanted Ghost dead.

03:02.265 --> 03:04.438
He doesn't sound like
the type of guy to wait forever.

03:06.853 --> 03:10.198
What do you think Lobos is gonna do
when he learns you're still alive?

03:10.357 --> 03:13.782
He's gonna send somebody
to finish the job.

03:13.944 --> 03:17.414
And that includes me,
just like it did Bell.

03:19.491 --> 03:21.914
Tommy, we can do this.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.667
Me... you...

03:24.830 --> 03:26.582
together.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.801
We can kill Ghost.

03:32.337 --> 03:35.090
Don't. Don't answer that.

03:36.842 --> 03:39.402
We are not leaving this apartment
until we find a way to kill him

03:39.428 --> 03:41.601

We love each other.

Everything's gonna work out.
That's what matters.

04:55.879 --> 04:58.132
That's not all that matters.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.722
There's just so many
obstacles between us.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.977
Obstacles?

05:14.397 --> 05:16.491
What obstacles
are you talking about?

05:16.650 --> 05:19.244
Tariq hates me,
and Paz hates you.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.868
And then there's your wife.

05:22.906 --> 05:25.500
You're still married to Tasha.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.974
I got to get going.
We can talk about this later tonight.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.989
Like-like a magic show.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.538
No, no, no?

07:08.303 --> 07:11.147
You control Ruiz,
but if he becomes a problem...

07:12.933 --> 07:15.527
I'm gonna have to tell Hugo
to kill somebody else.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.300
You know what?
Why don't you go ahead?

07:27.364 --> 07:29.124
I'll be in there in two minutes, okay?
Sorry.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.036
James, can I call you back?

07:33.203 --> 07:35.080
I need you to look
into something for me.

07:35.246 --> 07:36.806
Tasha and I,
we're already living apart,

07:36.831 --> 07:39.718
so I think a separation agreement's
the next logical step.

07:39.876 --> 07:43.471
So Miss Valdes is putting
the screws to you?

07:43.630 --> 07:46.224
But you sure you want to
formally separate?

07:46.383 --> 07:48.477
Spousal privileges can be tricky.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.933
What does Tasha know?

07:51.096 --> 07:53.645
I said a separation,
not a divorce, Proctor, not yet,

07:53.807 --> 07:56.687
but she wouldn't hurt the kids or
our bank account by sending me to jail.

07:56.712 --> 07:57.811
She told me that herself.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.571
So look,
if I send you the specifics,

07:59.729 --> 08:01.529
can you bring the papers
by Truth later today?

08:01.696 --> 08:04.056
- You got a guy, right?
- Yeah, I'll see what my guy can do,

08:04.081 --> 08:07.253
- and I'll call you later, okay?
- You do that. Later.

08:13.368 --> 08:17.748
AUSA Angela Valdes.
This is unexpected.

08:17.914 --> 08:21.168
- You don't have to do this.
- I think I do.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.087
It's a pretty rough neighborhood.
You know that.

08:24.254 --> 08:27.349
Listen, we both know why
you went off and found Ruiz.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.306
You want him to try and prove
this theory of yours

08:30.468 --> 08:32.812
about Jamie being Ghost.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.599
Why isn't putting Lobos in prison
enough for you?

08:35.765 --> 08:37.767
Why is it enough for you?

08:37.933 --> 08:39.607
Never would have been before.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.030
What happened to you?

08:43.188 --> 08:44.782
You used to be
one of the good guys.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.693
So did you.

08:46.860 --> 08:50.114
You keep trying to force
Jamie into this prosecution,

08:50.280 --> 08:53.284
but it's not gonna work,
and it could cost us Lobos.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.244
You love the guy?

08:57.454 --> 08:59.374
No matter what he does,
no matter what you learn,

08:59.456 --> 09:01.629
he really is,
you just can't let go.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.293
I get it.

09:05.295 --> 09:06.968
Aren't you tired of
lying for him, though?

09:07.130 --> 09:10.134
I'm tired of fighting you.

09:11.634 --> 09:14.683
You hate me.
You can't forgive me, fine.

09:14.846 --> 09:16.723
But don't screw up this case
because of me.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.984
Don't screw up this case
because of him, Angela.

09:21.186 --> 09:23.280
See you at work?

09:32.614 --> 09:35.367
Hey.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.495
Yeah, I'm almost done.
I know, we have to leave.

09:39.496 --> 09:40.998
Change of plans.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.164
You're gonna get to spend the day
with your father.

09:43.189 --> 09:45.001
- What?
- Yeah.

09:45.168 --> 09:46.841
Do I have to?

09:47.003 --> 09:49.347
Tariq, sweetheart,
this is a good thing.

09:49.506 --> 09:52.180
You two can spend
some quality time together.

09:52.342 --> 09:55.596
- What, Angela too busy?
- Watch it, boy, okay?

09:56.679 --> 09:59.523
What is going on? Come on.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.935
I don't know. It's just like...

10:02.102 --> 10:03.945
nothing's the same
with him anymore.

10:04.104 --> 10:07.278
Everything's just different.
He's different.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.747
Tariq, this is...

10:13.905 --> 10:15.999
this is where we are now.

10:17.367 --> 10:20.962
I know things don't look like
the way you want them to,

10:21.121 --> 10:24.876
but your dad is trying, okay?

10:25.041 --> 10:29.171
He wouldn't want to spend the day
with you if he wasn't, right?

10:29.337 --> 10:32.181
The least you can do is try, too.

10:33.341 --> 10:36.470
All right, if you're saying
that I have to, then I will.

10:37.554 --> 10:40.558
It's not that I wanted to, though...

10:40.723 --> 10:42.817
'cause I don't.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.691
Ruiz and his lawyers
seen the proffer agreement?

10:50.567 --> 10:52.069
Received it this morning,

10:52.235 --> 10:55.409
expecting to have it signed this afternoon
after we've got Ruiz on record.

10:55.572 --> 10:58.951
All we need from him is to
corroborate his meeting with Lobos.

10:59.117 --> 11:00.994
This would be the same meeting
that DEA Agent

11:01.161 --> 11:03.414
Juan Julio Medina
witnessed while undercover?

11:03.580 --> 11:06.459
- Correct.
- Looks good, Valdes.

11:07.208 --> 11:11.008
I don't know, sir.
Is... is this the best we can do?

11:14.465 --> 11:16.843
- How do you mean, Agent Knox?
- I just...

11:18.428 --> 11:21.102
You know, while we've got the snake,
why not squeeze him

11:21.264 --> 11:23.767
for every last drop of venom
he's got, right?

11:23.933 --> 11:26.356
That way, instead of hoping
to just go to trial,

11:26.519 --> 11:29.113
we can bury Lobos
under the fucking jail.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.030
Are you suggesting we ask Ruiz

11:33.193 --> 11:35.116
to give up Lobos's
whole New York organization?

11:35.278 --> 11:36.951
Yes, yes.

11:37.113 --> 11:41.118
Places, product, and names.

11:43.036 --> 11:46.791
It might not be the worst idea,
but would he go for it?

11:46.956 --> 11:49.459
- I'm not sure he will, sir.
- We'll have everything we need

11:49.626 --> 11:52.175
with the corroboration from Ruiz
about his meeting with Lobos.

11:52.337 --> 11:53.964
Everything else is inconsequential.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.804
True, but Ruiz doesn't know that.

11:56.966 --> 12:00.812
If we change strategy midstream,
it'll upset Ruiz and his attorney.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.813
It's not what they agreed to.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.519
We could end up with nothing.

12:04.682 --> 12:07.606
We could indict Ruiz on his own crimes
if he forces our hand.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.030
Let's use Greg's approach.

12:11.189 --> 12:13.032
All right, Saxe,
adjust the agreement.

12:13.191 --> 12:14.989
If Ruiz fingers Lobos, great,

12:15.151 --> 12:18.121
but if we can roll up
the whole bunch, why not?

12:18.988 --> 12:21.082
I've got a meeting.
I'll expect a report.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.835
Of course, sir.

12:26.537 --> 12:28.414
This can't be that complicated.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.061
Why don't you just walk up to him
and put a bullet in his head?

12:31.086 --> 12:33.173
Because this isn't
the fucking movies.

12:33.336 --> 12:36.180
If I do it in broad day like that,
somebody's gonna see me for sure,

12:36.339 --> 12:39.513
and then I'm locked up in a cage
upstate in two seconds flat.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.235
Ma, what the fuck
are you doing here?

12:57.402 --> 12:59.200
I didn't have a fucking choice.

12:59.362 --> 13:01.160
The mortgage is past due.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.125
- Just...
- What the hell happened to you?

13:04.284 --> 13:05.285
Nothing.

13:05.338 --> 13:07.178
Look, there must have been
some sort of mix-up.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.055
I'll call Tasha and have her
bring some checks over.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.240
Hey, whoever did this to you,

13:10.407 --> 13:12.327
you and James are gonna
take care of this, right?

13:12.352 --> 13:14.627
No, Ma, fuck Ghost.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.554
Told you I don't want
nothing to do with him.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.395
Who the hell is this?

13:24.554 --> 13:27.649
Ma, this Holly.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.605
You must be Tommy's mother.

13:29.767 --> 13:32.566
Hi. I'm Holly, his girlfriend.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.238
Is that my mother's ring?

13:39.235 --> 13:40.782
Yeah, I bought it out of hock,

13:40.945 --> 13:43.573
where you put it,
and then I gave it to her.

13:43.740 --> 13:46.118
Look, Ma, Holly and I
got a lot to do today.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.002
As soon as Tasha
brings the checks over,

13:48.161 --> 13:50.001
I'll bring them by, okay?
Don't worry about it.

13:50.026 --> 13:53.121
I'm not worried about it,
'cause I'm not leaving until I get them.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.593
Besides, I want to
get to know Haley...

13:55.752 --> 13:58.175
- Holly.
- Holly, right.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.262
See? We need to get to know
each other better.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.576
For you, son.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.289
- For the game tonight?
- Well, I planned on

14:28.451 --> 14:30.453
giving you those before
you took Angela's gun,

14:30.620 --> 14:33.460
so what was once a gift is something
that you're now gonna have to earn.

14:33.485 --> 14:35.783
Putting you to work today.

14:36.250 --> 14:40.221
- Yo, James.
- Andre, good morning.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.224
- Hey, man, we need to rap real quick...
- Meet my son, Tariq.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.968
Tariq, Andre.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.136
What's up, dog?

14:47.303 --> 14:49.023
Just need to talk to
your father real quick.

14:49.048 --> 14:51.482
We can do that later.
Look, a delivery just got here.

14:51.641 --> 14:53.721
I figured you could use
some extra hands for the day.

14:53.746 --> 14:55.487
Tariq could use a crash course
in the club,

14:55.645 --> 14:57.488
so he's your assistant for the day.

14:57.647 --> 14:58.990
Dad?

14:59.148 --> 15:01.401
You mind showing him the ropes?

15:02.485 --> 15:04.863
- Okay.
- Cool.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.747
You, pay attention.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.038
Look, folks,
we got to clear this hallway.

15:14.205 --> 15:15.331
Thank you.

15:15.498 --> 15:17.717
Charlie, what the hell's going on?

15:17.875 --> 15:20.503
Some high-valued federal witness
being moved through.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.638
All nonessential personnel
leaving the area.

15:29.679 --> 15:32.432
Charlie, hold the elevator.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.535
- Sir.
- What the fuck?

15:54.454 --> 15:56.206
Miss Valdes,
I'm glad I caught up with you.

15:56.372 --> 15:59.091
Now that we're gonna have
Ruiz's testimony against Lobos,

15:59.250 --> 16:01.594
I think you should start
pre-trial motions.

16:01.752 --> 16:04.221
Jury selection on a guy like this
is gonna be a bitch.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.633
We should think about
wealthy widows, no kids.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.302
No reason to take a bribe, right?
Walk with me, okay?

16:09.469 --> 16:12.143
There's a whole bunch of things...

16:12.305 --> 16:14.399
I want it on the record
that conducting this here

16:14.557 --> 16:18.061
rather than the safety of my client's
original location wasn't lost on us.

16:18.227 --> 16:21.572
Well,
let me be the first to apologize

16:21.731 --> 16:23.984
for the terrible
inconvenience, Mr. Ruiz.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.619
We should have known
we couldn't pull a fast one on you.

16:26.777 --> 16:29.326
I've seen this little intimidation game
you're playing before

16:29.489 --> 16:31.082
done better by better.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.038
So can we just get to why I'm here?

16:50.384 --> 16:51.761
Bullshit.

16:51.928 --> 16:54.852
I came here to talk about what happened
with Lobos, nothing more.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.437
- You people have a lot of nerve.
- Hold on.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.352
Your client's not under arrest.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.022
He could walk out
and back to his old life,

17:02.188 --> 17:04.486
but, Vibora,
you know what's awaiting you.

17:04.648 --> 17:07.949
Enemies trying to kill you,
Feds looking to bust you.

17:08.109 --> 17:10.363
Or you say yes

17:10.530 --> 17:12.453
and we protect you
and your business

17:12.615 --> 17:15.164
as long as you work with us
as a criminal informant.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.010
Let me get this straight.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.722
So you risk my client's life

17:31.884 --> 17:33.727
by marching him
through this building,

17:33.886 --> 17:36.014
where anyone can see him
dealing with the Feds,

17:36.180 --> 17:39.059
and then you tell him he should snitch
on his whole organization,

17:39.225 --> 17:42.069
everyone he knows,
in order to stay safe?

17:42.228 --> 17:45.653
I don't know if this is
incompetence or extortion,

17:45.815 --> 17:47.783
but either way,
it's not what we were promised.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.407
Can you leave me alone
with my client?

17:54.574 --> 17:56.827
I don't know if or when
we'll be willing to talk again.

17:58.286 --> 18:00.163
Leave us alone.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.593
I thought you got Vibora Ruiz

18:10.756 --> 18:13.600
- to leave town and stay that way.
- I did.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.512
Well, I just saw him
at the fucking Federal Building.

18:16.679 --> 18:20.024
- Ruiz got arrested?
- It didn't look like an arrest,

18:20.182 --> 18:22.150
and he was with
your girlfriend, Angela.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.111
- She didn't tell me.
- Yeah...

18:27.273 --> 18:30.573
I'm over there, and they start
clearing everybody out for a...

18:30.735 --> 18:33.409
A high-value federal witness,

18:33.571 --> 18:35.824
and in walks Ruiz.

18:36.866 --> 18:39.039
So he's gonna snitch,

18:39.201 --> 18:41.579
but the question is, on who?

18:43.748 --> 18:46.171
You sure he's gonna be loyal?

18:48.294 --> 18:50.888
I'm gonna take that face
you're making as a no.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.099
Look, with Ruiz in play,

18:54.258 --> 18:57.262
everything he knows
is potentially on the table.

18:57.428 --> 18:58.429
Yeah.

18:58.596 --> 19:02.146
That could be bad for Lobos
but <i>worse</i> for you.

19:03.726 --> 19:06.320
Angela didn't warn you at all?

19:08.564 --> 19:09.907
No.

19:10.066 --> 19:12.910
I know you've been adamant
about not using her,

19:13.069 --> 19:16.994
but, James, it's obvious
that she doesn't have your back.

19:28.918 --> 19:31.216
Got the separation papers
you asked for.

19:33.923 --> 19:37.223
You sure you still want them?

19:42.056 --> 19:44.058
So why you ain't in school, man?

19:45.267 --> 19:47.269
Got suspended.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.029
You got suspended?

19:49.188 --> 19:50.861
What happened,
you was yelling too loud

19:51.023 --> 19:52.775
at a lacrosse game or something?

19:53.984 --> 19:56.078
It's that bad?

19:57.947 --> 20:00.621
Just thought, I mean,
your pops had money so...

20:02.535 --> 20:05.015
Hey, don't even trip on it,
little homie, everybody been there.

20:05.121 --> 20:07.340
You got in trouble at school, too?

20:07.498 --> 20:09.045
Hell, yeah.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.303
I don't know nobody in the hood
didn't get in trouble.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.429
So how'd you get here?

20:17.717 --> 20:21.392
To be real with you,
I had my daughter.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.641
You know, the best thing
that ever happened to me, man.

20:24.807 --> 20:27.310
Didn't want her to grow up
the same way I grew up

20:27.476 --> 20:29.524
or you had... your dad had to.

20:29.687 --> 20:32.156
Wait, so you grew up
where my pop grew up?

20:32.314 --> 20:34.112
Yeah.

20:35.401 --> 20:37.153
Did you know his driver, Shawn?

20:38.904 --> 20:40.998
Yeah, you know...

20:41.157 --> 20:43.751
I met him a few times.
He was a good kid.

20:43.909 --> 20:46.833
Yeah, he was my friend,
but he died.

20:46.996 --> 20:50.091
My dad, he didn't even care.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.677
Oh, nah, nah.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.263
Trust me, your pops cared.

20:57.339 --> 21:00.388
I was with him
when he found out about Shawn.

21:00.551 --> 21:02.599
He took that real hard, man.

21:02.762 --> 21:06.437
- Yeah?
- Yes, very.

21:22.865 --> 21:25.618
Tommy, I could use
a little pick-me-up.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.422
So how'd you two meet?

21:38.589 --> 21:40.557
I was a waitress at Truth.

21:40.716 --> 21:43.811
So you fucked the boss.

21:43.969 --> 21:46.489
That's always the way to go
when you don't want to work anymore.

21:55.105 --> 21:57.705
What, are you gonna stand like a statue,
or are you gonna join in?

21:57.730 --> 21:58.982
Actually, I'm okay.

22:01.237 --> 22:04.992
Little Miss Bottle Service
is too good for it?

22:05.157 --> 22:07.410
Yeah, Hol, it's the good stuff.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.920
Come on.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.465
- What's up, Tash?
- Hey, what's up?

22:22.508 --> 22:25.603
All right, so I brought
the stuff you were look...

22:27.263 --> 22:31.109
Well, I'm glad to see
the family's all together.

22:31.267 --> 22:34.146
Tasha! It's so good to see you.

22:34.311 --> 22:37.440
Good to see you.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.700
Goodness, Kate,
I thought you quit.

22:39.859 --> 22:42.203
A little in the morning
never hurt, right, Tommy?

22:42.361 --> 22:43.783
Right.

22:43.946 --> 22:46.324
So how's everything?
How's Jamie?

22:46.490 --> 22:49.790
Honestly, I can't say I see
very much of him anymore, Ms. Egan.

22:49.952 --> 22:52.296
- Ghost moved out.
- Yeah. Ma, I told you.

22:52.454 --> 22:53.797
Right.

22:53.956 --> 22:56.316
He's messing around with that girl
he knew from high school,

22:56.341 --> 22:57.335
Angela Valdes?

22:57.501 --> 22:59.782
That's still going on?
I thought he'd be over that by now.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.807
Yeah, I'm in a rush,
so you said you needed these?

23:03.966 --> 23:05.968
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Sign it.

23:07.928 --> 23:10.556
Johnny Hancock. There we go.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.475
- That should do it. Okay.
- Thank you.

23:12.641 --> 23:14.401
- All right, I'll walk you out.
- No, no, no.

23:14.426 --> 23:15.769
I'm too hungry to go anymore.

23:15.928 --> 23:17.480
- Got any food, Tommy?
- Hungry?

23:17.646 --> 23:18.738
No, I don't have any food.

23:18.898 --> 23:21.151
Why the hell
don't you have any food?

23:25.154 --> 23:27.327
She does blow with her son?

23:27.489 --> 23:30.333
Yeah, well, this is Kate
on good behavior, actually.

23:30.492 --> 23:33.496
- Jesus.
- I told you about her.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.710
Wait until Tommy
tells her about the baby.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.127
Fuck, you haven't told him yet?

23:41.337 --> 23:44.090
I'm-I'm sorry she brought up
the whole Ghost thing.

23:45.591 --> 23:47.764
Is he with Angela today?

23:47.927 --> 23:51.397
No, he's at the club planning
some damn party, as usual.

23:51.555 --> 23:53.853
Look, I'm gonna slip out
before she gets back.

23:54.016 --> 23:57.566
- Bye, Tommy! Bye, Kate!
- Bye, Tasha.

24:02.483 --> 24:04.668
What the fuck happened to the deal
you offered me in California?

24:04.693 --> 24:06.536
Still got a chance to get the deal.
It's fine.

24:06.695 --> 24:07.947
They're just...

24:08.113 --> 24:10.673
they're gonna need a little more
from you than Lobos, that's all.

24:10.698 --> 24:12.898
And like I said, you want Lobos,
I will give him to you,

24:12.923 --> 24:15.079
but anything beyond that
is on you people.

24:15.245 --> 24:17.247
As soon as Nunez returns,

24:17.414 --> 24:19.212
I'm taking my information,
and I'm leaving.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.969
- I'd strongly advise against that.
- You would?

24:22.127 --> 24:23.720
Why is that?

24:23.879 --> 24:26.302
'Cause I know you ordered
the murder of Nomar Arcielo,

24:26.465 --> 24:29.184
and I know you had
Tommy Egan do it.

24:34.515 --> 24:36.267
You don't know
what you're talking about.

24:36.433 --> 24:39.277
I didn't kill anyone,
and I don't even know who that is.

24:39.436 --> 24:40.938
Yes, you do.

24:41.105 --> 24:43.153
And with Nomar, sick fuck,

24:43.315 --> 24:46.068
being a federal informant,

24:46.235 --> 24:49.205
means you got the death penalty
staring you in the face, Ruiz.

24:51.532 --> 24:53.409
You don't say anything...

24:53.575 --> 24:54.918
You know what?

24:55.077 --> 24:56.795
You said enough
on the voice recordings

24:56.954 --> 24:59.002
Nomar got for us
by wearing a wire.

24:59.164 --> 25:02.464
My, well, my personal favorite

25:02.626 --> 25:04.799
was the one where Tommy Egan
came and checked on you

25:04.962 --> 25:07.090
following your stabbing.

25:07.256 --> 25:09.304
That's very sweet.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.060
What do you want?

25:24.440 --> 25:28.286
What I need is
the chain of command.

25:28.444 --> 25:30.162
You're gonna give me
the chain of command

25:30.320 --> 25:32.914
of who was between you and Lobos.

25:33.907 --> 25:36.456
You give me the identity of Ghost,

25:36.618 --> 25:38.461
you're gonna get the deal,

25:38.620 --> 25:41.544
and you and I will never
have to see each other again.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.907
Much obliged.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.193
I wanted to apologize.

26:09.359 --> 26:11.487
Apparently, we lost eyes on you
inside the club

26:11.653 --> 26:13.326
and weren't able to tail you.

26:13.489 --> 26:15.708
It was a long night, Dean.

26:15.866 --> 26:18.506
Loud music. I just wanted to get out
of there without an entourage.

26:18.531 --> 26:20.250
That's it.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.380
Is, uh, that gonna be a trend?

26:22.539 --> 26:24.758
I ask because
the manpower needed

26:24.917 --> 26:26.840
to properly secure
your three clubs

26:27.002 --> 26:29.255
comes on top of
their time securing you.

26:29.421 --> 26:32.675
Well, actually, being that I'm paying,
it's my time, isn't it?

26:32.841 --> 26:34.343
- That's true.
- Which at this point,

26:34.510 --> 26:36.103
I think I may no longer need,

26:36.261 --> 26:38.764
seeing as though you said
no one has been following me.

26:38.931 --> 26:41.559
- Well, we still need to be sure...
- Then it's settled.

26:41.725 --> 26:44.045
You and your men just stay on
the clubs only moving forward

26:44.186 --> 26:48.191
and cease following me
in my personal life.

26:48.357 --> 26:50.906
Okay, if that's what you want.

26:54.863 --> 26:56.865
Is that your son?

26:57.032 --> 26:58.955
Yeah, his name is Tariq.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.041
He's a good-looking boy.

27:05.290 --> 27:06.917
Son, you learning
anything at the club?

27:07.084 --> 27:08.882
Yeah, I guess.

27:20.389 --> 27:22.232
I joined the Twitter.

27:22.391 --> 27:25.144
- "The Twitter."
- Yeah.

27:25.310 --> 27:27.654
I got a lot of images there.
Check 'em out.

27:27.813 --> 27:29.656
Tell me if I'm doing all right.

27:29.815 --> 27:32.175
Yeah, that's some good pictures,
but it's not "The Twitter."

27:32.317 --> 27:33.864
It's just Twitter.

27:34.945 --> 27:37.164
You should join Instagram
and Snapchat, too.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.916
You're pretty much on top
of this stuff?

27:40.075 --> 27:41.998
Basically.

27:42.536 --> 27:44.413
You're a smart kid, Tariq,

27:44.580 --> 27:46.457
smarter than I ever was.

27:47.916 --> 27:51.261
Which is why I work so hard
to provide opportunities for you

27:51.420 --> 27:54.014
that I never had.

27:54.173 --> 27:57.598
It's also why I'm a little confused
by your actions lately, son.

27:57.759 --> 27:59.682
What's going on, man?

28:02.931 --> 28:04.854
Come on, 'Riq, talk to me.

28:05.809 --> 28:07.356
It's just me and you here.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.362
No principal, not your mother.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.444
Just you and your father.

28:11.607 --> 28:14.656
Why would you really go
in Angela's purse and take a gun?

28:14.818 --> 28:16.946
Somebody bothering you at school
I should know about?

28:18.113 --> 28:19.615
No.

28:19.781 --> 28:21.621
Is it what's going on
between me and your moms?

28:21.646 --> 28:24.712
Because we told you,
no matter what happens,

28:24.870 --> 28:28.591
it will never change the way that
we feel about you and your sisters.

28:30.459 --> 28:32.382
I was just angry.

28:33.253 --> 28:36.132
You move out,
you make us meet Angela,

28:36.298 --> 28:38.858
and you move in with her,
and you don't even talk to us about it.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.806
Like, what kind of father does that?

28:53.607 --> 28:55.985
A real man apologizes

28:56.151 --> 28:58.324
when he's done something wrong.

28:59.696 --> 29:02.119
Guess the way I handled
all of that was wrong.

29:05.494 --> 29:07.246
I'm sorry.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.504
Sorry, son.

29:18.465 --> 29:20.138
All right.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.363
Mike.

29:42.364 --> 29:44.116
Mike, you okay?

29:44.908 --> 29:47.002
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.709
Just really want to nail this fucker.

29:52.207 --> 29:54.209
Nunez called.
He's on his way back.

29:54.376 --> 29:56.378
Ruiz wants to talk.

29:56.545 --> 29:58.718
Son of a bitch
finally came to his senses.

29:59.715 --> 30:02.719
Once we have Ruiz's agreement in place,
we got Lobos by the balls.

30:02.884 --> 30:06.388
I want Ruiz transferred and locked down
in D.C. until he testifies.

30:08.265 --> 30:10.643
I'll get right on it, sir.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.611
We finally get Lobos

30:16.773 --> 30:19.526
and now everybody else who worked
for him in our jurisdiction?

30:20.569 --> 30:22.663
I'll be right back.

30:34.916 --> 30:36.418
What the fuck did you do?

30:40.881 --> 30:43.009
Jamie.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.428
You asked me before,

30:45.594 --> 30:49.269
if things ever got serious,
would I tell you if you need a lawyer?

30:51.350 --> 30:53.773
Well, I think you need to get one.

31:04.488 --> 31:06.456
I see.

31:06.948 --> 31:09.076
Were you gonna tell me about Ruiz?

31:10.160 --> 31:11.787
How do you know about that?

31:11.953 --> 31:14.456
Is he in town to testify
against Tommy, Lobos, me, what?

31:14.623 --> 31:17.183
- I'm trying to figure it out here.
- How do you know about Ruiz?

31:17.209 --> 31:19.303
Not from you,
and that's what matters.

31:20.796 --> 31:22.969
This is the "obstacle"
that you were talking about?

31:23.131 --> 31:25.554
I mean, you know why
he's a problem today, right?

31:25.717 --> 31:27.811
Ruiz is a problem today
because of you

31:27.969 --> 31:29.609
and what you did
with his daughter Isabel.

31:29.634 --> 31:30.646
See, I got rid of him.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.729
I got him to leave, vanish even,

31:32.891 --> 31:34.564
to help you
so you could help me.

31:34.726 --> 31:38.651
I have helped you,
more than I should have.

31:42.692 --> 31:44.569
You have to trust me.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.830
I have trusted you...

31:47.697 --> 31:50.120
before now. Now I don't know.

31:56.164 --> 31:58.792
Angela, I really don't want to...

32:00.377 --> 32:02.675
but if I have to, I'll fix it myself.

32:05.173 --> 32:06.891
But don't-don't make me.

32:07.509 --> 32:09.432
Just-just help me.

32:12.764 --> 32:15.938
- Just help me.
- I used to be a good prosecutor.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.772
And I'm trying to be
a good man...

32:20.814 --> 32:23.283
for you.

32:25.318 --> 32:27.571
That's my office.

32:27.737 --> 32:29.284
I got to go.

32:49.718 --> 32:51.595
Nana, Dada's home.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.397
I'm coming, baby.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.351
I'm coming. I'm coming.

33:00.353 --> 33:02.981
She's lucky,
she didn't even get your nose.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.116
Do, do, do, do.

33:05.275 --> 33:06.868
Do, do, do.

33:08.361 --> 33:10.329
Told your girl
I'll look after little mama.

33:10.489 --> 33:13.242
Yes, I did.
That's what I told your mama.

33:15.076 --> 33:16.919
You failed me, Dre.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.294
- You picked Ghost over me.
- No, no, I didn't.

33:20.457 --> 33:23.256
Look, look, just put...
Just put my daughter down, please.

33:23.418 --> 33:26.388
I don't want to hear it.
You had one job, one.

33:28.507 --> 33:31.101
Now you standing there like
you're gonna have to shit yourself.

33:31.259 --> 33:33.307
What's the matter?

33:33.470 --> 33:35.518
Baby, it's okay, baby, it's okay.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.680
Look, look, look, y-you know,
you don't understand.

33:37.807 --> 33:39.684
- Look, Ghost-Ghost-Ghost...
- Wanna fly?

33:39.851 --> 33:41.819
- Trust me.
- Fly, baby? Fly, baby?

33:41.978 --> 33:43.413
Look, look, look, look, look!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

33:43.438 --> 33:45.158
I promise you. I promise you.
I promise you.

33:45.183 --> 33:47.561
Please, I'm right where
you want me to be.

33:48.276 --> 33:51.246
Shit, I mean, I just spent
the whole day with his kid, man.

33:52.113 --> 33:54.115
I just... Trust me, bro.

33:54.282 --> 33:56.202
I promise you,
I'm right where you want me to be.

33:56.227 --> 33:58.128
It's gonna be okay, baby.

33:58.286 --> 34:00.630
Come on. Come on.
Go on to Daddy.

34:02.207 --> 34:03.767
It's gonna be okay, baby.
It's all over.

34:06.878 --> 34:09.301
I'll need you soon enough,
so stay ready.

34:11.800 --> 34:14.553
Hey, this place...
This place is really nice, man.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.766
You're doing real good.

34:18.723 --> 34:20.646
You didn't have shit
when I met you, boy.

34:20.809 --> 34:21.981
It's gonna be okay.

34:22.143 --> 34:25.067
It's gonna be okay.
It's okay. It's okay, baby.

34:31.402 --> 34:33.826
I already told your friend
that I was gonna talk, Miss...

34:33.989 --> 34:37.619
- AUSA Angela Valdes.
- Angela Valdes.

34:42.914 --> 34:45.417
If getting your deal
is important to you,

34:45.583 --> 34:49.589
the easier you make our job,
the better it is for you.

34:50.422 --> 34:53.346
The best way for you to do that
is in the proffer session.

34:53.507 --> 34:56.478
Stick only to
your meeting with Lobos.

34:57.679 --> 34:59.898
Only to my meeting with Lobos?

35:00.056 --> 35:01.524
What the hell is going on here?

35:01.683 --> 35:04.323
First you people tell me you want me
to say everything, and then...

35:07.522 --> 35:10.867
Your friend told me that
I have to snitch on Ghost

35:11.026 --> 35:13.870
because of Nomar,
or else I get the death penalty.

35:14.029 --> 35:16.532
I have no choice.

35:18.325 --> 35:20.544
I don't know who said what...

35:22.120 --> 35:24.043
but I wouldn't be concerned
about that right now.

35:24.205 --> 35:26.207
"Wouldn't be concerned"?

35:26.374 --> 35:28.923
You have me on tape.
Conversations.

35:29.544 --> 35:32.388
If we were going to take you to trial
for the murder of Nomar,

35:32.547 --> 35:35.187
your motive would be that he was
fucking your 14-year-old daughter.

35:35.258 --> 35:37.477
What he did with her was terrible,

35:37.636 --> 35:41.140
and no jury in the land
would convict you of that.

35:41.306 --> 35:42.933
My boss wants Lobos.

35:43.099 --> 35:45.397
Just give us him, nothing else.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.740
Ghost saved your life.

36:00.909 --> 36:03.128
Vladimir, Drifty.

36:36.611 --> 36:38.955
You told me she was gonna leave
as soon as she got checks.

36:39.114 --> 36:41.037
We are running out of time.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.792
You got to do something, Tommy.

36:42.951 --> 36:44.294
- Step up.
- All right.

36:44.452 --> 36:45.669
Jesus, get the fuck off.

36:45.829 --> 36:48.127
Would have done more,
but this is all you had.

36:48.289 --> 36:50.132
Somebody ought to do
some shopping.

36:51.710 --> 36:54.054
Come on, Ma.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.634
Is this mood you're in

36:55.797 --> 36:57.717
because of what's going on
between you and James?

36:57.742 --> 37:00.852
You always act like this
when you two fight.

37:01.010 --> 37:03.809
But Jamie has always
shown up for you.

37:05.640 --> 37:08.143
He ever tell you about the time
these two boys jumped him?

37:08.309 --> 37:09.811
We lived in a black neighborhood.

37:09.978 --> 37:13.653
Called him all kinds of names
for being white.

37:13.815 --> 37:16.659
James found those boys.

37:16.818 --> 37:18.320
Gave them what they had
coming to 'em.

37:18.486 --> 37:21.330
They never bothered Tommy again.

37:21.489 --> 37:24.208
No one did, as a matter of fact.

37:41.843 --> 37:43.561
- Yo, J.
- Yo.

37:53.354 --> 37:56.528
Hey, Tommy, who's your friend?

37:56.691 --> 37:59.114
Tall shot of tequila, isn't he?

37:59.277 --> 38:01.200
- Hola.
- Talk to me.

38:01.362 --> 38:03.364
All right, so I made the rounds.
We're good to go.

38:03.531 --> 38:05.249
- We might have a problem.
- Why?

38:05.408 --> 38:08.878
Our dumb-ass Asian friend,
Dylan, he just got wet up.

38:09.037 --> 38:10.038
- What?
- Yeah.

38:10.205 --> 38:11.798
Him and his whole crew
got taken out.

38:11.956 --> 38:13.708
Fuck.

38:13.875 --> 38:15.218
He was a fucking piece of shit,

38:15.376 --> 38:17.416
but we can't let motherfuckers
fuck with our people,

38:17.545 --> 38:19.047
- so get strapped up.
- Right.

38:20.048 --> 38:22.528
- Where did it happen?
- Outside some church in Hell's Kitchen.

38:24.761 --> 38:26.559
- This happen last night?
- Yeah.

38:28.223 --> 38:29.975
Any word on who took them out?

38:30.141 --> 38:32.815
No, man, as far as I know,
I haven't heard or seen shit.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.404
All right, don't make no moves.

38:35.563 --> 38:37.110
Yet.

38:37.273 --> 38:39.071
Bet.

38:42.570 --> 38:45.574
It's time for you to go, Ma.

38:45.740 --> 38:48.835
- I'll drive you to the train.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:49.577 --> 38:51.124
Nice to meet you.

38:51.287 --> 38:54.257
- Yeah, nice to meet you, Kate.
- Yeah.

38:59.754 --> 39:01.427
Get rid of her.

39:01.589 --> 39:04.934
Hey, Holly's my girl.
I love her.

39:05.093 --> 39:08.188
You sound like such an idiot.

39:08.346 --> 39:11.020
Yo, why don't you
fucking play nice, all right?

39:11.933 --> 39:13.310
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

39:13.476 --> 39:16.446
That shit you were saying
about Ghost, you really believe that?

39:16.604 --> 39:20.199
Of course I do.
He's as much my son as you are.

39:20.358 --> 39:22.861
I think you believe it, too.

39:29.117 --> 39:31.119
All right, baby, I'll see you later.

39:36.958 --> 39:39.802
Did you meet with Felipe Lobos
at the Torres Fight Club?

39:39.961 --> 39:42.384
What was the nature of that meeting?

39:43.464 --> 39:46.468
Lobos was unhappy
with his drug distributor.

39:46.634 --> 39:48.511
I offered my services.

39:48.678 --> 39:52.899
What was his response?
Did he deny being a drug dealer?

39:54.058 --> 39:57.653
No. He did decline
my services, though.

39:57.812 --> 40:00.656
I believe he said we were
too low-rent for him.

40:00.815 --> 40:03.819
You said Lobos was unhappy
with his distributor.

40:04.736 --> 40:05.988
Do you know his name?

40:07.572 --> 40:09.825
Yes.

40:11.326 --> 40:12.669
Ghost.

40:14.913 --> 40:17.166
That's the street name.
Do you know his real name?

40:25.214 --> 40:27.683
No.

40:32.513 --> 40:35.266
You're saying that
you don't know the identity of Ghost.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.276
My client answered
the question, Mr. Saxe.

40:37.435 --> 40:39.108
What you-you don't?

40:39.270 --> 40:41.068
W-what about the plan
you two took part in

40:41.230 --> 40:44.234
to murder a criminal informant
of ours, Mr. Nomar Arcielo?

40:44.400 --> 40:48.246
See, we have your client on tape
in commission with Ghost.

40:48.404 --> 40:51.624
We know you know
his real name, Mr. Ruiz.

40:51.783 --> 40:53.877
If you refuse to tell us,

40:54.035 --> 40:56.955
we're gonna have to give you the death
penalty for Nomar Arcielo's murder.

40:57.080 --> 41:01.051
You can't prove my client knew
Mr. Arcielo was a criminal informant.

41:01.209 --> 41:03.712
Even if my client were guilty
of that murder,

41:03.878 --> 41:05.425
his motive is clear.

41:05.588 --> 41:08.888
Nomar Arcielo was having sex
with his 14-year-old daughter.

41:10.885 --> 41:13.764
It's the easiest affirmative
defense argument...

41:13.930 --> 41:16.308
in history.

41:16.474 --> 41:20.729
My client's willing
to give up Lobos, that's it.

41:20.895 --> 41:24.445
- Okay...
- We'll take Lobos. We're done here.

41:33.074 --> 41:34.246
Sign it.

41:34.409 --> 41:36.803
It's a federal agreement stating that
in exchange for a reduced sentence,

41:36.828 --> 41:38.948
you'll go on record
with information of Diego Jimenez,

41:38.973 --> 41:40.816
leader of the Jimenez Cartels.

41:49.298 --> 41:52.268
If you do it, it means
we're required to transfer you

41:52.427 --> 41:54.020
from this facility to Teterboro,

41:54.178 --> 41:56.018
where you'll be flown to D.C.
for witness prep.

41:56.139 --> 41:57.937
It's up to you

41:58.099 --> 42:00.648
whether you make it to Teterboro
while still in federal custody.

42:03.771 --> 42:06.011
Once I have all the info,
you can contact your associates

42:06.036 --> 42:08.289
on the outside
to make arrangements.

42:17.368 --> 42:19.871
See you soon, coquito.

42:29.630 --> 42:32.008
Holly.

42:33.217 --> 42:35.265
It all makes fucking sense now.

42:36.054 --> 42:38.182
It wasn't Lobos
who was trying to kill me.

42:38.347 --> 42:41.066
It was Dylan
and the fucking Koreans.

42:41.225 --> 42:43.478
Wait, Julio told you this?

42:43.644 --> 42:46.693
Yeah, and I bet you it was Ghost
who shot those motherfuckers.

42:46.856 --> 42:49.325
It had to be.
Where the fuck is my phone?

42:49.484 --> 42:51.578
Maybe it wasn't Lobos,

42:51.736 --> 42:54.831
but that doesn't change the fact
that he wants Ghost dead,

42:54.989 --> 42:57.333
and he's gonna kill us

42:57.492 --> 42:59.210
That's why I got to talk to Ghost.

42:59.368 --> 43:01.996
I got to sit down with him,
sort this shit out once and for all.

43:02.163 --> 43:04.165
- I'll be back.
- Tommy, don't. Please.

43:04.332 --> 43:06.585
I don't want you to get hurt.

43:08.586 --> 43:12.090
Holly, what you mean?

43:12.256 --> 43:14.008
Why would I get hurt?

43:14.175 --> 43:17.770
Who got courtside tickets
to the game, man?

43:17.929 --> 43:19.522
You know we do.

43:19.680 --> 43:21.899
Yeah, man, it should be fun.

43:22.058 --> 43:24.026
I still like Nas better.

43:24.185 --> 43:26.938
What? You like Nas better?

43:27.105 --> 43:30.075
Oh, come on, man.
I-l got something for you to listen to.

43:30.233 --> 43:32.156

No.

about Lobos anymore,

43:56.384 --> 44:00.059
because we don't have to
worry about Ghost.

44:00.221 --> 44:02.144
What did you do?

44:04.308 --> 44:06.527
I had to protect us, Tommy.

44:07.145 --> 44:08.271
You weren't gonna do it.

44:08.437 --> 44:11.987
Holly, what the fuck did you do?!

44:14.193 --> 44:16.616
- The Jamaicans.
- No!

44:16.779 --> 44:18.952
You didn't do it,
so I fucking hired them myself.

44:21.075 --> 44:23.248
You stay right fucking here.

44:23.411 --> 44:25.163
I got to warn Ghost.

It's too late, Tommy.

44:27.331 --> 44:28.924
It's too late.

44:54.275 --> 44:57.449
Don't you say that!
Don't you fucking say that!

44:57.612 --> 45:00.957
No, no, no, no, no, no!

49:27.298 --> 49:31.394
Thomas, an unexpected development
has presented itself,

49:31.552 --> 49:33.725
one that I must seize.

49:33.888 --> 49:38.268
Pretty soon, I will be able
to spread my wings again,

49:38.434 --> 49:42.405
but before that happens,
I need your help opening the cage.

49:42.563 --> 49:44.565
So listen carefully.

49:44.732 --> 49:47.155
I have a job for you.

49:48.569 --> 49:51.573
Absolutely. I'll make sure
all the parties are notified.

49:51.739 --> 49:52.911
Thanks.

49:53.073 --> 49:55.747
Valdes, I need you to get
this paperwork started.

49:55.910 --> 49:59.005
- Transfer papers for Ruiz?
- No, Felipe Lobos.

50:00.915 --> 50:04.419
Lobos's attorney got word of
Ruiz's deal, and that was enough.

50:04.585 --> 50:08.089
Lobos finally cracked and agreed
to give up the Jimenez cartel.

50:08.255 --> 50:10.098
It was too much for D.C.
to pass up.

50:10.257 --> 50:11.697
They want him transferred
right away.

50:11.800 --> 50:14.053
I need those filed tonight.

50:19.433 --> 50:22.277
Angela, this is a good thing.

50:22.436 --> 50:26.236
We're still putting Lobos away,
plus another big fish.

50:27.274 --> 50:28.446
It's good.

51:02.309 --> 51:04.562
You don't have to worry
about Ruiz...

51:05.271 --> 51:07.899
or Lobos, for that matter.

51:08.065 --> 51:10.067
You're safe.

51:11.151 --> 51:14.246
Lobos agreed to turn witness
against the Jimenez cartel.

51:15.114 --> 51:17.412
He'll be transferred
out of state any day now.

51:20.744 --> 51:23.122
The Lobos case is over.

51:30.212 --> 51:32.180
You asked me to help you.

51:36.385 --> 51:38.763
Has no one ever helped you before?

51:40.431 --> 51:42.525
Not like this.

51:44.768 --> 51:46.520
Not like you.

52:00.534 --> 52:03.538
I know you feel like
you've compromised a lot for me, so...

52:10.544 --> 52:12.387
If you still want me...

52:20.137 --> 52:21.889
Jamie.

52:25.601 --> 52:27.945
Do you think Tasha will sign them?

52:28.103 --> 52:29.730
And if she does...

52:29.897 --> 52:31.570
I don't know,
it could be dangerous.

52:31.732 --> 52:33.234
It's-it's a risk.

52:34.276 --> 52:36.745
A risk I'm willing to take.

52:43.243 --> 52:45.041
I love you.

52:45.746 --> 52:47.919
I mean it.

53:48.600 --> 53:50.398

53:51.979 --> 53:53.902
Tommy, you in here?

54:02.823 --> 54:04.541
Tommy.

54:44.031 --> 54:45.829
Help me.

55:15.646 --> 55:17.398
It's done.

55:44.174 --> 55:47.769
So the Koreans, that was you?

55:54.434 --> 55:56.186
Yeah.

55:58.105 --> 55:59.705
And someone tried
to take me out tonight.

55:59.857 --> 56:01.737
They tried to fire on me
while I was with Tariq.

56:01.775 --> 56:03.118
Tariq was with you?

56:03.277 --> 56:05.075
- So that was you?
- No.

56:08.448 --> 56:10.621
That was Holly.

56:13.537 --> 56:15.756
Lobos hired me to kill you.

56:16.957 --> 56:19.631
Said he'd do her...
Her and me if I didn't,

56:19.793 --> 56:21.545
but I still didn't do it.

56:24.798 --> 56:26.641
So she...

56:33.473 --> 56:36.101
Lobos isn't gonna stop
till you're in the ground.

56:38.562 --> 56:40.439
Me too.

56:41.648 --> 56:43.867
So you know what we got to do.

56:45.861 --> 56:48.284
We got to kill Lobos...
