18:34.905 --> 18:35.740
Kelly.

18:37.575 --> 18:38.451
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.995
I wanted the Kelly
who did my nails yesterday.

18:41.078 --> 18:42.580
Okay. I'm Kelly today.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.373
N-no, that's not...

18:44.874 --> 18:46.167
Oh, there she is.

18:49.003 --> 18:50.212
Hey there...

18:50.296 --> 18:51.589
Vanessa?

18:51.672 --> 18:52.715
But you're Kelly.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.717
You've been Kelly
as long as I've known you.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.344
I'm not Kelly or Vanessa,

18:56.427 --> 18:58.679
just like that isn't Amy
and that isn't Pam

18:58.763 --> 19:02.099
and that definitely isn't Lashonda.

19:02.183 --> 19:03.476
No one cares what our names are,

19:03.559 --> 19:05.645
so Mr. Park just has us grab
name tags out of a bowl.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.313
What do you mean, no one cares?

19:07.396 --> 19:08.481
I care.

19:08.564 --> 19:09.857
You're people. You have names.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.317
You should be able to use them.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.652
I'm gonna say something.

19:12.735 --> 19:14.528
No! Please, don't.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.699
It'll just make him meaner to us,
and he'll take more of our tips.

19:18.783 --> 19:20.159
You shouldn't put up with that.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.744
You're talented.

19:21.827 --> 19:25.331
You should quit
and start your own nail-itorium.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.375
Oh, that's a great idea!

19:27.458 --> 19:29.585
I'll be sure to do that
as soon as I pay back

19:29.669 --> 19:32.505
the $10,000 I owe Mr. Park

19:32.588 --> 19:35.216
for my flight here
in the trunk of a Kia Sorento

19:35.299 --> 19:37.551
that was
inside an unpressurized cargo plane.

19:38.427 --> 19:41.180
Look, I know you're trying to be nice,

19:41.263 --> 19:42.723
but you just don't understand.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.892
Like parents? No.

19:45.559 --> 19:48.187
I know how it feels to be treated
like you don't matter.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.022
You know weekends and booger nails.

19:50.106 --> 19:52.066
Please don't get involved.

19:52.149 --> 19:54.902
Is there a problem here, Vanessa?

19:54.985 --> 19:57.988
[dramatic music playing]

20:00.491 --> 20:01.325
No.

20:03.119 --> 20:04.704
I guess everything's fine.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.208
[sighs]

20:10.042 --> 20:11.585
- Oh!
- Sorry...

20:11.669 --> 20:13.003
Linda.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.509
[indistinct chatter]

20:18.592 --> 20:22.555
Now that he's conquered the music world
and his fear of birds,

20:22.638 --> 20:24.682
Tripp is getting into acting.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.100
Isn't that right, Tripp?

20:26.183 --> 20:29.478
There's a naked lady in that painting!
[chuckles]

20:29.562 --> 20:31.313
Wait. Is that...

20:31.814 --> 20:33.566
Motherfu--

20:33.649 --> 20:37.069
I'm sorry, did you just say
that Tripp Knob is getting into acting?

20:37.153 --> 20:39.321
Yes, I did.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.699
Jacqueline White, White Talent.

20:41.782 --> 20:44.702
You know, Tripp is available
and looking to move to LA.

20:44.785 --> 20:45.619
Mm.

20:45.703 --> 20:48.080
He will do nudity
but only if he can keep his shirt on.

20:48.164 --> 20:50.082
I just love it when rich kids
get into the biz.

20:50.166 --> 20:52.084
It makes it so much easier
to find financing,

20:52.168 --> 20:54.962
and they're so confident and tall,
which is all acting really is.

20:55.880 --> 20:56.797
Sophie Van Nuys.

20:56.881 --> 20:59.216
I've seen you on the cover of <i>Variety.</i>

20:59.300 --> 21:01.218
I was working at a Jamba Juice
two weeks ago,

21:01.302 --> 21:03.554
then all the men in Hollywood
got caught with their wee-wees out,

21:03.637 --> 21:04.972
and now I run a whole studio.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.474
I'd love to put Tripp in something.

21:06.557 --> 21:07.516
But it's Sunday.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.351
Can he wait till tomorrow
to be in a movie?

21:09.435 --> 21:11.353
He'll rocket-blimp out tonight.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.814
Tell him to aim for LA, Blimp Net Seven.

21:13.898 --> 21:16.817
Hey, look what I'm doing
at the painting, Jacqueline.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.737
Won't you excuse me? [laughs]

21:23.240 --> 21:24.742
Can you believe Kelly-Vanessa?

21:24.825 --> 21:27.661
Thinking I'm just another
fancy white jerk.

21:27.745 --> 21:29.663
I know what it's like
to be treated like dirt.

21:29.747 --> 21:31.540
I spent 15 years underground.

21:31.624 --> 21:32.875
That's where dirt lives.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.919
Girl, you need to stop, drop, and roll.

21:35.002 --> 21:37.046
By which I mean stop talking,
drop the subject,

21:37.129 --> 21:38.506
and go get me a cinnamon roll.

21:38.589 --> 21:40.466
You don't know
what those women's lives are like.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.092
You can't because of white privilege.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.220
Are you kidding?

21:44.303 --> 21:46.055
You think I've had it easier
because I'm white?

21:46.138 --> 21:50.059
I shared a plastic toilet pumpkin
and a plastic shower pumpkin

21:50.142 --> 21:51.101
with three other ladies.

21:51.185 --> 21:53.145
And yes, sometimes they got mixed up.

21:53.229 --> 21:54.230
People can't see that.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.941
Why do you think HouseFlix keeps
suggesting you watch those shows

21:57.024 --> 21:59.026
about women murdering
their cheating husbands?

21:59.109 --> 22:00.653
Because of bunker stuff?

22:00.736 --> 22:02.988
No. Because it's white lady porn.

22:03.072 --> 22:05.449
Their lives are safe and predictable,
so once in a while,

22:05.533 --> 22:08.118
they need to see Tim Daly
push a woman down a staircase.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.454
Don't believe me?

22:10.538 --> 22:11.747
Watch.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.083
[quirky music playing]

22:14.166 --> 22:16.794
[man] OMG.

22:16.877 --> 22:20.297
That is so Y-O-U.

22:20.381 --> 22:22.091
You should see how it looks in the light.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.176
Take it for a spin
around the neighborhood.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.720
Now I'm just going to think
about putting that coat on.

22:26.804 --> 22:28.430
Can I help you, sir?

22:28.514 --> 22:30.474
Bathrooms are for customers only.

22:32.977 --> 22:35.604
So it doesn't matter
what I've been through.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.481
This is how the world sees me.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.359
If someone didn't know me,

22:40.442 --> 22:42.820
they'd think I was another one
of those spoiled white ladies

22:42.903 --> 22:44.071
who says things like--

22:44.154 --> 22:45.781
[Jacqueline] This is unacceptable!

22:45.864 --> 22:49.910
I will be writing a Yelp review
about this experience, Sondra.

22:51.161 --> 22:52.663
Oh, God.

22:52.746 --> 22:56.250
I'm shopping at the same store
as Titus and Kimmy.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.377
Sondra, do you sell guns?

22:58.460 --> 23:00.129
Why are you shopping at all?

23:00.212 --> 23:02.423
Because I deserve a treat.

23:02.506 --> 23:05.050
I'm a working mom trying to have it all.

23:05.134 --> 23:06.510
I've come a long way, baby.

23:06.594 --> 23:08.846
No. You said you were broke.

23:08.929 --> 23:12.558
Oh, that was before I got Tripp cast
in a movie.

23:12.641 --> 23:13.809
Who the fip is Tripp?

23:13.892 --> 23:17.646
Just some rich white idiot
with zero acting experience.

23:19.106 --> 23:21.942
So you used your white privilege
to help someone.

23:22.526 --> 23:23.986
Mostly myself.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.030
That's why I became white
in the first place.

23:27.197 --> 23:30.284
[bright music playing]

23:30.367 --> 23:32.912
[man] Enjoy the coat.
Bring it back whenever.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.082
Am I to wait all day?

23:37.166 --> 23:40.544
[with French accent] Where is the manager
of this establishment?

23:40.628 --> 23:42.338
I'm extremely white over here.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.422
I am the manager.

23:43.505 --> 23:44.882
Finally.

23:44.965 --> 23:47.343
I'm supposed to go to the seashore
this weekend,

23:47.426 --> 23:49.595
but now, thanks to your butchers,

23:49.678 --> 23:52.181
I'll be the laughingstock
of the in-ground pool!

23:52.264 --> 23:53.974
Oh, is that not what you wanted?

23:54.058 --> 23:58.562
[scoffs] Only a child or an adult
who lived underground for 15 years

23:58.646 --> 24:01.023
would think these awesome nails
are awesome.

24:01.106 --> 24:02.733
[whispering] I'm sorry, nails. I love you.

24:02.816 --> 24:04.818
Do you remember who worked on you?

24:04.902 --> 24:06.278
And that's another thing.

24:06.362 --> 24:08.113
I don't even know whom to yell at.

24:08.197 --> 24:11.700
They change names every day,
like so many Puffs Daddy.

24:11.784 --> 24:15.037
I want real names
so I can yell at the real person.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.331
I've half a mind to mention this
to Mayor Del Blancio

24:17.414 --> 24:19.124
this weekend at the horse party.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.376
No! Please don't do that.

24:20.459 --> 24:23.003
Using real names is a good idea.

24:23.087 --> 24:24.296
I'll take care of this.

24:24.380 --> 24:27.132
Thank you... Ji Yeon.

24:29.218 --> 24:30.552
We did it!

24:30.636 --> 24:33.514
I know being able to use your real names
isn't a big whoop.

24:33.597 --> 24:34.932
It's just a small whoop.

24:35.015 --> 24:37.351
- But it's a whoop in the right direction.
- Sure.

24:37.434 --> 24:39.895
The important thing is,
you feel good about it.

24:40.604 --> 24:44.066
I know it's not a tragedy contest,
Ji Yeon,

24:44.149 --> 24:45.693
but if it were...

24:45.776 --> 24:47.611
I would fudging win.

I can't believe the weekend's over.

24:53.784 --> 24:55.577
