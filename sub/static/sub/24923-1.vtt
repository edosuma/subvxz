45:41.572 --> 45:43.813
Do everything they say.

45:43.950 --> 45:46.362
We will cooperate.
Fully.

45:46.494 --> 45:47.734
Who planted the bomb?
Where are they?

45:47.870 --> 45:50.156
If we knew them, we would
give them up to you.

45:50.289 --> 45:51.529
We reject violence.

45:51.666 --> 45:54.703
Okay, I want photos of all
the dollies, serial numbers.

45:54.835 --> 45:56.371
-Search the place.
-Yes, sir.

45:56.504 --> 45:58.540
[Indistinct talking]

46:01.801 --> 46:03.792
Clear!

46:11.978 --> 46:13.718
-Eyes down.
-Keep your hands up.

46:13.854 --> 46:15.810
Be still!

46:15.940 --> 46:18.852
-Eyes forward.
-Face forward, now!

46:20.861 --> 46:23.694
-Get your hands high.
-Stay still or I'll shoot.

46:23.823 --> 46:27.031
-Do not move.
-Look at me.

46:35.209 --> 46:36.745
-Back up!
-Stop moving!

46:36.877 --> 46:38.287
Back on your knees!

46:47.054 --> 46:49.170
Scanner says
there's two in here.

46:56.605 --> 46:58.596
-On your knees!
-MAX: Agnes?

46:58.733 --> 46:59.768
They'll shoot us all.

46:59.900 --> 47:01.310
-They make a move, you engage.
-Do as he says.

47:01.444 --> 47:03.150
Yes, sir.

47:03.279 --> 47:05.895
MAX: Agnes.
Agnes, please.

47:07.033 --> 47:08.193
Agnes.

47:09.493 --> 47:11.745
Come on.
Come on.

47:11.871 --> 47:13.953
MAX:
Please. Agnes.

47:14.081 --> 47:15.537
Shut up!

47:18.711 --> 47:20.827
-Don't move!
-You, back on the floor!

47:20.963 --> 47:22.749
-Don't move!
-Get back down!

47:23.591 --> 47:27.049
-Weapons ready.
-Come on, dolly, get down!

47:27.178 --> 47:30.466
Right. You have 10 seconds
till I drop you!
