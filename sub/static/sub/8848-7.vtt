How old are you, boy?

01:17.034 --> 01:18.870
I ain't but 9 years, sir.

01:19.036 --> 01:20.871
Pay up, gentlemen.

01:20.996 --> 01:23.625
It's dangerous, you know,
teaching them to read.

01:23.791 --> 01:27.612
That's true.
Nat Turner was taught to read.

01:27.737 --> 01:28.839
Nonsense.

01:29.005 --> 01:30.815
Let me show you.

Boy, can you explain
to me the meaning

01:35.044 --> 01:37.454
of what you just read?

01:37.579 --> 01:38.980
No, master.

01:39.599 --> 01:40.357
See?

01:40.482 --> 01:43.103
It's like a parrot
reciting Shakespeare.

gentlemen.

03:53.024 --> 03:55.932
We follow the North Platte
clear into Wyoming,

03:56.057 --> 03:58.668
and we skirt the black hills
to the South,

03:58.793 --> 04:01.438
and strike the Rockies here.

04:01.563 --> 04:05.166

Am I understood?

04:18.048 --> 04:20.177
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, Mr. Durant.

Good. [Sighs]

04:27.556 --> 04:30.324
And we will finish on schedule?

04:30.603 --> 04:33.940
We won't finish anything if I don't
dig myself out of this hole we're in.

04:34.106 --> 04:35.734
How long will you be gone, sir?

04:35.900 --> 04:36.940
A few days.

04:37.065 --> 04:38.570
I'm escorting Mrs. Bell to Chicago.

04:38.736 --> 04:41.411
Ohh.

04:41.536 --> 04:44.576
You can wipe that lascivious
look off your face.

04:44.742 --> 04:46.416
It's not what you think.

04:46.541 --> 04:48.952
I'm seeing senator crane.

04:49.077 --> 04:53.126
I have seen how she look at you.

Cullen:
I guess you're leaving.

05:24.946 --> 05:29.659
I'm going to Chicago to see
my late husband's family.

05:29.784 --> 05:32.582
Then it's on to England.

05:32.748 --> 05:36.002
You don't sound too
excited about going home.

05:36.168 --> 05:39.589
I don't have a home anymore.

05:41.732 --> 05:46.145
I had hoped to stay here
with Robert forever,

05:46.270 --> 05:48.890

05:49.056 --> 05:50.740
Raise a family.

Grow old and die together.

for our plans, Mrs. Bell.

06:55.642 --> 06:57.709
You've gotta do somethin'.

06:57.875 --> 07:00.336
Talk to the Swede.
He's the head of security.

07:00.502 --> 07:03.715
He's the one gave them the go ahead.

07:03.881 --> 07:06.092

let off some steam.

had best move along right now!

07:47.527 --> 07:48.635
Let him loose!

07:49.193 --> 07:52.222
Let him loose or there's going to be
a river of Mick blood flowing in here!

07:52.388 --> 07:55.350
There'll be an ocean of nigger blood.
I guarantee that. Boys.

07:58.602 --> 08:00.897
Looks like you've brung
shovels to a gunfight.

08:01.063 --> 08:02.857
Well, no matter.

08:03.023 --> 08:04.859
We'll use them to dig your graves.

08:05.025 --> 08:06.194
We'll take our chances.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.029
Put your weapons down.

08:08.195 --> 08:11.574
This is between him and me.

08:13.325 --> 08:14.961
Ain't no use in none of y'all
getting shot dead for it.

08:15.086 --> 08:16.662
I can't do that.

08:16.787 --> 08:18.355
We can't just walk away.

08:18.622 --> 08:21.234
You've got to walk away...
Because the rest of y'all

08:21.359 --> 08:22.794

08:26.005 --> 08:28.133
Mr. Toole...

08:30.926 --> 08:31.945
Give me your word they ain't going

08:32.070 --> 08:34.438
to come to no harm if they walk away.

08:40.947 --> 08:43.273
You have my word.

08:43.438 --> 08:46.359
Tell your men to put their guns down.

08:47.687 --> 08:50.029
Lower your guns, boys.

08:56.295 --> 08:57.537

09:18.552 --> 09:20.196
Tuck your tails!

09:20.321 --> 09:22.555
Ain't nothing we can do.

09:29.597 --> 09:31.773
I don't know whether
you're aware of it,

09:31.898 --> 09:36.168
but we Irish are the niggers
of the British Empire.

09:38.171 --> 09:40.248
That what this is about?

09:40.373 --> 09:42.832
You showin' the world you ain't at
the bottom of the barrel no more?

09:42.998 --> 09:45.386
You're damn right it is.

Any last words?

09:50.283 --> 09:53.185
I'm going to kill
your lily white ass.

09:54.676 --> 09:57.180

In the end, when
all is said and done,

12:20.338 --> 12:23.149
all we really own is our death.

12:23.274 --> 12:26.485
It is given us the moment we is born,

12:26.610 --> 12:31.047
and we carry that burden
the best we can.

12:35.520 --> 12:38.498
I've seen men die screaming.

on Cullen Bohannon.

12:48.233 --> 12:52.105
Well, then perhaps
he was stupid after all.

12:55.572 --> 12:57.573
Now...

13:00.277 --> 13:06.793
This... hanging of yours
went not so well.

13:06.918 --> 13:10.289
He was as good as dead
till Johnny Reb came busting in here.

13:10.455 --> 13:13.709
What do you propose to do about it?

13:13.875 --> 13:15.628
What do you mean?

13:15.794 --> 13:19.205
Well, this brigand...

13:19.330 --> 13:25.311
This rebel... has upset
the balance once again.

13:25.436 --> 13:29.559
And he must be dealt with.

13:31.343 --> 13:32.937
I still don't follow.

13:35.581 --> 13:38.276
Why does that not surprise me?

13:40.821 --> 13:47.660
You... must pursue... Bohannon.

13:57.838 --> 14:02.008
and you'll clean it up or die trying.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.177
I'll not do it.

14:04.344 --> 14:07.388
Aah! Jesus!

14:07.554 --> 14:12.226
Now, all of you that was
involved in this hanging

14:12.392 --> 14:17.600
will accompany Mr. Toole
on his noble quest.

14:17.725 --> 14:21.471
How the hell do you expect these
Bogtrotters to track down Bohannon?

14:21.596 --> 14:23.673
Well, that's their problem.

14:23.798 --> 14:27.310
Ah, let me and Dix take 'em.

slow up. Slow up.

You ain't that free.

Why you get to decide that?

15:17.186 --> 15:19.697
I ain't decide nothing.

15:19.822 --> 15:22.757
That's the way of the world.

15:37.974 --> 15:40.940
What's it like to own
somebody, Mr. Cullen?

15:42.611 --> 15:47.549
Any different than owning
a dog or a pig or a plow?

15:50.053 --> 15:51.096

they was family to you.

your dirty drawers,

you still be owning her.

16:21.730 --> 16:25.776
Yes, sir.
That might be nice.

16:25.942 --> 16:27.631

from the fields

16:41.739 --> 16:43.707

16:45.409 --> 16:47.778
Or would half of him be free?

And what if I bring that boy
into my house from time to time?

16:54.587 --> 16:57.221
And teach him to read and write?

16:59.258 --> 17:02.470
And I give that boy
just enough hope...

Just maybe he different.

18:34.458 --> 18:36.991
You weren't at dinner.

18:37.361 --> 18:40.640
I... supped on Brandy.

18:40.765 --> 18:42.747
Five course meal.

18:56.381 --> 18:58.054
Do you know what this is?

18:58.220 --> 19:00.514
[Sighs]
It's a penny.

19:00.680 --> 19:03.095
I wish it were just a penny...

19:03.220 --> 19:06.437
Rather than the seed
of my own destruction.

19:06.603 --> 19:08.981
I don't understand.

19:12.025 --> 19:17.065
I was raised in a shanty
town in hell's kitchen.

19:19.702 --> 19:22.147
Only difference between
us and the rats

19:22.272 --> 19:25.618
were the rats were
better fed and cleaner.

19:25.743 --> 19:26.999
Sorry to hear that.

19:28.511 --> 19:30.753
I don't want your sympathy.

19:34.017 --> 19:37.563
One day, while I was rummaging
through the trash for a meal...

19:37.688 --> 19:41.733
Some gentlemen passed me by.

19:41.858 --> 19:45.403
One of them told me
he would give me a penny

19:45.528 --> 19:48.239
if I ate a putrid apple

19:48.364 --> 19:52.411
that even the rats had passed over.

19:52.536 --> 19:58.405
I... will never forget that taste.

19:58.571 --> 20:03.327
It was all I could do
to keep it down.

20:03.493 --> 20:09.195
Ohh. They had a good laugh, and...

20:09.320 --> 20:11.794
One of them tossed me the coin.

20:11.960 --> 20:18.005
And on that day, my bark
was set on a course

20:18.130 --> 20:22.721
that neither tempest nor
leviathan could alter.

20:22.887 --> 20:26.281
I would have it all...

20:26.406 --> 20:32.106
And I would have it on my terms.

20:32.345 --> 20:34.079
[Sighs]

20:35.849 --> 20:37.611
I know no other way, Lily.

20:37.777 --> 20:41.031
I faced ruin many times...

20:41.197 --> 20:42.964
And I always found a way out.

20:43.089 --> 20:45.299
But...

20:45.424 --> 20:50.428
This time... I fear I may not recover.

20:54.466 --> 20:58.511
Is this Thomas Durant...

20:58.636 --> 21:01.594
Or some blubbering schoolboy
I see before me?

21:01.760 --> 21:04.221
I gave you those maps

21:04.387 --> 21:09.122
so you could finish the railroad...
For Robert's sake.

21:09.247 --> 21:11.729
I won't let you quit.

21:17.990 --> 21:23.282
Get your head out of that bottle
and figure out a way.

21:31.237 --> 21:33.542
[Train whistle blows]

21:33.708 --> 21:35.874
[Crickets]

21:51.957 --> 21:56.093
I gave my slaves their freedom
before the war started.

21:58.797 --> 22:01.608
Damn near went broke
paying their wages.

22:01.733 --> 22:04.768
I'm supposed to thank you for that?

22:06.533 --> 22:08.605
No.

22:10.809 --> 22:12.609
I only did it for my wife.

22:14.912 --> 22:17.690
I sure as hell didn't understand it.

22:17.815 --> 22:19.992
[Sighs]

22:20.117 --> 22:23.562
It pissed me off, tell you the truth.

22:23.687 --> 22:26.831
So why'd you do it, then?

22:26.956 --> 22:28.724
Well...

22:31.558 --> 22:34.605
Mary had a way of
talking me into things.

22:34.730 --> 22:36.564
Hmm.

22:40.035 --> 22:44.481
It wasn't until
I come home from the war...

22:44.606 --> 22:48.819
Right then, actually...

22:48.944 --> 22:52.981
That I understood that she was right.

22:57.654 --> 23:01.000
I found Mary where she was hanged,
you know.

23:01.125 --> 23:06.063
But... I couldn't find my boy.

23:11.702 --> 23:13.412
We'd always play hide and go seek,

23:13.537 --> 23:16.815
and he'd always hide
up in the hayloft.

23:16.940 --> 23:21.243
Every damned time... every time...

23:21.608 --> 23:27.783
He'd... and I'd just...
I'd pretend like I couldn't find him.

23:31.589 --> 23:33.690
See, the Yankees, they...

23:34.120 --> 23:36.436
They burned the barn,
but it was still standing.

23:36.561 --> 23:38.062
And...

23:43.436 --> 23:46.467
There he was...

23:46.906 --> 23:49.074
Up in the hayloft.

23:51.277 --> 23:54.923
His body was curled up,
and his arms was...

23:55.048 --> 23:58.979
Hugging his knees to his chest.

23:59.353 --> 24:01.796
But he wasn't alone.

24:01.921 --> 24:05.800
Bethel... the woman who raised me...

24:05.925 --> 24:08.303
She was with him.

24:08.428 --> 24:11.197
She had her arms
wrapped around him...

24:11.658 --> 24:14.767
Like she was protecting
him from the flame.

24:22.975 --> 24:27.279
Both their bodies, they were...
Scorched black...

24:29.648 --> 24:32.193
Fused together, you know?

24:32.318 --> 24:36.387
Couldn't really tell where one of
them ended and the other one began.

24:40.091 --> 24:42.068
And I just remember standing there

24:42.193 --> 24:44.561
and thinking to myself...

24:48.033 --> 24:51.444
God's got a funny way
of teaching you things.

24:51.569 --> 24:53.403
Huh?

25:00.412 --> 25:01.542
Yeah.

25:04.883 --> 25:08.085
I wouldn't give a s if I was you,
either.

25:30.194 --> 25:32.351
Ahem. You ever shoot a gun?

25:32.476 --> 25:34.219
Oh, yeah.

25:34.344 --> 25:37.513
Massah let us shoot guns on
the plantation all the time.

25:42.586 --> 25:44.087
You try.

25:49.259 --> 25:51.427
You got to cock it.

25:54.264 --> 25:55.596
Again.

25:58.556 --> 26:00.770
Keep firing.

26:10.068 --> 26:10.986
Damn.

26:11.152 --> 26:12.654
And you're ready.

26:12.820 --> 26:14.823
What do you mean, I'm ready?
I can't even hit the dang tree.

26:14.989 --> 26:17.284
Well, you're just going to
have to get in close, then.

26:17.450 --> 26:20.329
How am I going to get up
close without getting shot?

26:20.495 --> 26:24.102
Whoever you're shooting at is going
to be just as scared as you are.

26:24.227 --> 26:27.606
You take your time.
Don't lose your head.

26:27.731 --> 26:28.962
Count your rounds as you fire.

26:29.128 --> 26:33.044
If you're calm, you'll
count their rounds, too.

26:33.169 --> 26:36.386
The trick is making sure the other
man has to reload before you do.

26:36.552 --> 26:37.804
And if I don't?

26:40.056 --> 26:42.267
You're dead.
End of lesson.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.871
Good morning.

27:00.996 --> 27:02.506
Good morning, Thomas.

27:02.631 --> 27:05.540
I think I may have found
a way out of my mess.

27:05.706 --> 27:09.881
Now, this is a map of
all the other railroads...

27:10.006 --> 27:12.547
An intricate web of iron
connecting all the eastern cities.

27:12.713 --> 27:14.883
But something is missing.

27:15.049 --> 27:16.593
Can you see it?

27:18.617 --> 27:20.806
There is no direct route connecting

27:20.972 --> 27:23.433
the Union Pacific to New York... yet.

27:23.599 --> 27:24.768
Well done.

27:24.934 --> 27:26.395
Why not?

27:26.561 --> 27:28.569
Well, I have two choices.

27:28.694 --> 27:30.737
I can build a beltline to the R&R

27:30.862 --> 27:34.069
or to the M&M line, further south.

27:34.235 --> 27:37.614
I own substantial stock in the R&R.

27:37.780 --> 27:42.452
But I don't understand how this
helps you out of your mess.

27:42.618 --> 27:47.644
A stock tip like that could have the
president himself eating out of my hand.

27:49.282 --> 27:52.421
And I know senator crane,
that's exactly what he's after.

27:56.883 --> 27:59.057
[Indistinct chatter]

28:09.395 --> 28:11.581
I didn't know
they had something planned.

28:11.706 --> 28:13.583
I don't know them well.

28:13.708 --> 28:14.984
I've only met them once.

28:15.109 --> 28:17.029
I'm sure they'll be
very happy to see you.

28:19.313 --> 28:22.158
I'm not so sure.
Can't you stay a while?

28:22.283 --> 28:24.160
I have to meet with senator crane,

28:24.285 --> 28:27.555
but I'll be back later to
take you to your hotel.

I am so sorry to see you
under such circumstances.

already out of mourning.

have me by the short hairs.

in hand to beseech you.

29:28.215 --> 29:30.185
Show some mercy.

29:30.351 --> 29:34.563
I'm almost tempted
to see this through

29:34.688 --> 29:37.317
and let you rot in jail.

29:37.483 --> 29:39.000
Almost?

29:39.125 --> 29:41.446
So there's hope?

29:41.612 --> 29:44.199
There's hope.

29:45.898 --> 29:47.828

connecting to the R&R or the M&M.

the authorities now.

able to save himself.

dying breath so she could live.

31:42.441 --> 31:45.262
I begged Robert not
to marry the woman...

the savage, Charlotte.

32:14.890 --> 32:16.977
He is the reason I still draw breath,

32:17.143 --> 32:19.646
but I didn't just stand
back and watch it happen.

32:19.812 --> 32:24.297
We fought together,
side by side, just as we lived.

32:24.422 --> 32:27.028
I wouldn't expect you to
understand that, Charlotte.

32:27.194 --> 32:31.324
Robert fought hard,
but the Indian prevailed.

32:31.490 --> 32:37.455
I watched him murder my husband,
and he would have killed me next.

32:37.621 --> 32:39.332
But I tore an arrow from my shoulder

32:39.939 --> 32:43.585
and thrust it through his throat,
and I pushed.

32:43.710 --> 32:48.466

until he was dead.

37:53.854 --> 37:57.064
You still have your senator's salary.

37:57.189 --> 37:59.199
This isn't over.

37:59.324 --> 38:04.905
There's still the matter
of the missing $147,000.

38:05.030 --> 38:07.965
Already back in the company's till.

38:09.661 --> 38:14.167
Some strange sort
of accounting mistake.

38:14.333 --> 38:17.518
People have already lost
their jobs over it.

38:17.643 --> 38:20.757
Ahem.
And just to be sure,

38:20.923 --> 38:24.415
I've applied grease to
all the proper machinery.

38:25.010 --> 38:27.594
Rumor has it you made
3 million off the deal.

38:27.719 --> 38:29.515
5.

38:29.681 --> 38:32.900
I managed to buy the M&M
stock at quite a discount.

38:33.025 --> 38:36.731
But don't tell a soul.

38:36.897 --> 38:40.026
Thomas... please...

38:40.192 --> 38:42.737
I have a family.

38:45.039 --> 38:46.908
Don't worry, Jordan.

38:47.074 --> 38:50.520
You're still of some use to me.

38:50.645 --> 38:52.080
Well, in the meantime,

38:52.246 --> 38:54.832
here's a shiny new penny for you.

38:58.627 --> 39:00.920
[Chuckles]

39:17.302 --> 39:20.014
Are you sure about this?

39:20.139 --> 39:21.806
Yes.

39:23.151 --> 39:24.320
But what will you do?

39:24.486 --> 39:26.114
Where will you live?

39:26.280 --> 39:28.956
I haven't figured it out yet.

39:29.081 --> 39:31.452
I do know that I cannot
go back to London.

39:33.085 --> 39:36.207
I cannot go back to
a life I now despise.

39:38.524 --> 39:40.920
Then it's decided.

39:43.839 --> 39:45.508
I knew you would understand.

39:48.260 --> 39:51.973
Lily, there's something
I must tell you.

39:52.139 --> 39:54.309
Thomas.
No, no, I must say this.

39:54.475 --> 39:59.886
I am a man, and what I
have with my wife is...

40:00.011 --> 40:04.610
It is not...
What a man needs.

40:08.621 --> 40:13.334
Ours was always a practical marriage.

40:13.459 --> 40:15.246
I mean, there was a time when...

40:15.412 --> 40:16.670
Mmm.

40:16.795 --> 40:19.130
But that time is past.

40:22.033 --> 40:25.512
What I'm saying is if...

40:25.637 --> 40:29.177
If I had a woman like you by my side,

40:29.343 --> 40:31.484
then... no.

40:31.609 --> 40:35.489
If I had you by my side, Lily,

40:35.614 --> 40:37.592
there is nothing I...

40:37.717 --> 40:41.296
We couldn't do together.

40:41.421 --> 40:45.301
This isn't fair on you.
I know. I know that.

40:45.426 --> 40:47.487
Don't say anything.

40:47.653 --> 40:49.372
If there is a chance...

40:49.497 --> 40:55.379
If there is the glimmer
of the faintest chance,

40:55.504 --> 40:59.173
then you will make me
a very happy man.

41:04.294 --> 41:06.413
[Train whistle blowing]

41:09.350 --> 41:10.927
What about Toole?

41:12.520 --> 41:15.356
He out in them woods
with a bullet in him.

41:16.974 --> 41:18.684
They all dead?

41:20.530 --> 41:21.729
Yep.

41:25.035 --> 41:28.513
Found this in one of his saddlebags.

41:28.638 --> 41:31.140
Ahem. You reckon I
should say something?

41:32.309 --> 41:35.119
Suit yourself.

41:35.244 --> 41:38.313
I don't really know my Bible verses.

41:39.982 --> 41:42.317
23rd psalm.

41:51.493 --> 41:53.537
"The Lord is my Shepherd.

41:53.662 --> 41:56.039
"I shall not want.

41:56.164 --> 41:59.267
"He maketh me to lie down
in the green pastures.

41:59.433 --> 42:02.547
"He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

42:02.672 --> 42:04.783
Both:
"He restoreth my soul.

42:04.908 --> 42:10.890
"He leadeth me in paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

42:11.015 --> 42:13.990
"Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

42:14.156 --> 42:17.728
"I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

42:17.853 --> 42:20.621
"Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

42:20.787 --> 42:24.267
"Surely, goodness
and mercy shall follow me

42:24.392 --> 42:26.569
"all the days of my life,

42:26.694 --> 42:30.797
and I will dwell in
the house of the Lord forever."
