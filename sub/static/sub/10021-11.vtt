00:07.040 --> 00:07.904
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

00:08.108 --> 00:10.406
Having a drink sounds great.

00:10.610 --> 00:11.542
What?

00:11.745 --> 00:13.474
- You went out with her?
- Just dinner.

00:13.680 --> 00:17.741
We should embrace our mistakes and
learn from them to improve the system.

00:17.951 --> 00:22.081
I'm going to put the microphone-holder
right behind the ear.

00:22.288 --> 00:24.153
I wanted to postpone Reece's
operation.

00:25.992 --> 00:26.981
Are you coughing up blood?

00:27.193 --> 00:30.128
If that woman has tuberculosis,
it's highly contagious.

00:30.330 --> 00:33.493
Something about me
brings out the worst in people.

00:35.635 --> 00:36.829
Merry Christmas, Amanda.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.273
<i>Got a beautiful snowstorm last night.</i>

00:43.410 --> 00:46.106
- I should really get up.
- Me too.

00:46.813 --> 00:49.008
You seen my pajama bottoms?

00:51.684 --> 00:53.811
You should talk to IKerry
about the heat.

00:54.020 --> 00:56.420
It was pretty hot in here
a minute ago.

00:58.491 --> 01:01.085
So I'll pick you up tonight around 9?

01:01.294 --> 01:03.125
I said I'd think about it.

01:04.030 --> 01:05.827
My friends are dying to meet you.

01:06.032 --> 01:09.627
Girls' night out?
I'd feel like I was on display.

01:10.036 --> 01:13.005
It'll beat babysitting
a med student on a Friday.

01:13.206 --> 01:16.607
Lucy's presenting Chief rounds
tomorrow. It's a big deal.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.402
And Lucy is a big girl.

01:19.312 --> 01:21.303
I'd rather spend the night with you.

01:21.514 --> 01:22.981
But only with you!

01:25.085 --> 01:28.077
John, what is that?

01:29.622 --> 01:32.523
That is a major drag.

01:38.665 --> 01:40.098
- Hey!
- Sorry.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.791
- You were an easy target.
- Quite an arm.

01:43.002 --> 01:46.529
My grandfather was a pitcher
for the Cincinnati Reds.

01:46.739 --> 01:49.139
Isn't this is an emergency entrance?

01:49.342 --> 01:53.176
The plow comes in and pushes
the snow from one side to the other.

01:54.547 --> 01:55.673
I'll call Maintenance.

01:55.882 --> 01:59.045
Don't bother. By the time
they get here, it'll be spring.

01:59.252 --> 02:02.244
Snow reminds me of the year
I spent working in Alaska.

02:02.455 --> 02:03.979
You've done it all.

02:04.724 --> 02:06.157
I try.

02:06.493 --> 02:08.426
You've got something on your back.

02:10.163 --> 02:11.824
You think that's funny, huh?

02:14.100 --> 02:15.226
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

02:15.435 --> 02:17.198
I'm sorry.

02:17.537 --> 02:19.937
- I'm vibrating.
- What?

02:20.140 --> 02:21.835
It's my pager.

02:27.247 --> 02:28.908
See you inside.

02:31.451 --> 02:34.750
So Mark said dinner plans
are, quote, "optional."

02:34.954 --> 02:37.650
If everything's going well,
we should vamoose.

02:37.857 --> 02:40.826
I hope things go well.
He deserves it.

02:41.027 --> 02:42.324
Think they've slept together?

02:42.529 --> 02:45.498
Well, if they observed
the three-date rule...

02:45.698 --> 02:46.528
What's that?

02:46.733 --> 02:50.601
One, you go out. Two, you get invited
in. Three, you close the deal.

02:50.803 --> 02:52.464
- It's their fourth.
- Lf you recall...

02:52.672 --> 02:54.299
...we closed the deal on one.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.839
Well, yeah.
I was never much for rules.

02:59.145 --> 03:03.548
Hang on. Call in a Code White.
Get a gurney and a crash cart.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.074

03:56.603 --> 04:00.004
Joi Abbott fainted in the cafeteria,
tachycardic at 130.

04:00.206 --> 04:01.264
I'm fine. Really.

04:01.474 --> 04:03.032
She's probably dehydrated.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.473
Exam Two's open.
We got it from here, Doug.

04:07.547 --> 04:08.479
Excuse me.

04:08.681 --> 04:09.943
Yo! Can I help you?

04:10.149 --> 04:11.013
Who are you?

04:11.217 --> 04:13.310
- Who are you?
- Who is this guy?

04:13.519 --> 04:17.182
Doug Ross, Pedes ER Attending, meet
Tony Fig, Transport Dispatcher.

04:17.390 --> 04:19.755
He's here while Jerry
and Randi are sick.

04:19.959 --> 04:24.157
Some dude from NASA called about your
Phase Two application packet.

04:24.364 --> 04:26.059
"NASA" as in the space program?

04:26.266 --> 04:29.565
Probably "Nassau" as in trying to sell
me a timeshare. There's no number.

04:29.769 --> 04:32.294
- Said they'd call back.
- Bet it was Jerry.

04:32.505 --> 04:34.871
He's made two crank calls
from home already.

04:35.908 --> 04:39.071
Doug, I DC'd the otitis media.
We're free and clear.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.405
Excuse me.

04:40.613 --> 04:43.480
For a nanosecond. Yes, officer?

04:43.683 --> 04:44.809
What can I do for you?

04:45.018 --> 04:48.579
Scott Pew. Thought it'd be cool
to bumper-ski on my patrol car.

04:48.788 --> 04:52.952
Until I made a U-turn and he shot into
a hedge. He says he broke his arm.

04:53.159 --> 04:56.094
It's more like his elbow.
Looks like a fracture.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.228
I'm gonna sit you down.

04:57.430 --> 05:00.695
He could be a good candidate for our
pain medication study.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.925
I'll get his parents' consent.

05:03.269 --> 05:05.328
Would you take a look at my hand?

05:05.538 --> 05:07.267
I got a splinter.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.703
I'm working in Pedes.
I'll find you someone.

05:09.909 --> 05:11.399
I'm a kid at heart.

05:11.611 --> 05:14.239
I'll meet you in the Suture Room
in a minute.

05:16.115 --> 05:18.276
- I need to go.
- Could you be pregnant?

05:18.484 --> 05:20.577
No, my husband and I are separated.

05:20.787 --> 05:23.153
When was the last time you ate?

05:23.356 --> 05:26.257
I don't know. Lunch, yesterday.

05:26.459 --> 05:28.086
Your body's malnourished.

05:28.294 --> 05:31.024
My son's getting an MRI.
If I'm not there when he's done...

05:31.230 --> 05:34.290
We can call and explain.
They'll keep an eye on him.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.833
He gets scared if I'm not there.
We have to get to the clinic.

05:38.037 --> 05:39.163
We have a clinic here.

05:39.372 --> 05:43.706
Ricky goes to the Genetics Clinic.
Will you take this out, please?

05:44.610 --> 05:46.601
What's your son's medical condition?

05:46.813 --> 05:48.678
ALD. Adrenoleukodystrophy.

05:49.716 --> 05:51.308
Advanced?

05:51.951 --> 05:53.111
Are you giving him oils?

05:53.319 --> 05:54.445
It's too late.

05:54.654 --> 05:56.485
We'll have your results
in an hour...

05:56.689 --> 05:59.749
...if you'd like to come back
when you're through upstairs.

05:59.959 --> 06:02.257
Maybe. Thanks.

06:04.964 --> 06:06.488
Well, we tried.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.695
I'm looking forward
to our double date.

06:09.902 --> 06:11.733
Oh, me too.

06:11.938 --> 06:13.929
If you don't mind me asking...

06:14.440 --> 06:16.374
...have you and Mark
ever been intimate?

06:16.576 --> 06:19.875
Me and Mark? No, why?

06:20.079 --> 06:24.539
Well, I just wondered if he makes a
habit of seducing coworkers.

06:24.751 --> 06:26.810
He's been so aggressive.

06:29.322 --> 06:30.914
Oh, don't get me wrong.

06:31.124 --> 06:34.821
I have never been as satisfied
with anyone as I am with this man.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.460
But when someone's that inventive...

06:39.499 --> 06:41.296
...you suspect he's a Don Juan.

06:41.701 --> 06:43.498
We are talking about Mark Greene?

06:44.337 --> 06:48.171
Last night on his fire escape...
I'll drop these at the lab.

06:49.776 --> 06:52.006
I must have gotten it from that woman.

06:52.211 --> 06:54.179
Any night sweats or fever?

06:54.380 --> 06:57.611
A positive test doesn't mean TB,
just that I'm exposed.

06:57.817 --> 06:59.045
You need a chest x-ray.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.619
And INH prophylaxis for at least
six months. I know the drill.

07:02.822 --> 07:03.686
I'm sorry.

07:03.890 --> 07:06.791
The risk of being a doctor.
I'm glad you're negative.

07:06.993 --> 07:09.894
- Carter, Roxanne, line two.
- Thanks, Lily.

07:10.363 --> 07:13.264
I have to cancel our study plans
this evening.

07:13.466 --> 07:15.661
- Something's come up.
- No problem.

07:15.868 --> 07:17.893
Maybe you and Bernard
can review together.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.093
Hey, what's up?

07:19.305 --> 07:21.068
- You hated it.
- Well, no.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.866
I haven't read it thoroughly.

07:23.075 --> 07:25.043
Do you think I can get it published?

07:25.244 --> 07:27.303
- It is controversial.
- That's bad?

07:27.513 --> 07:29.811
For you? Right now? Oh, yeah.

07:30.016 --> 07:32.143
- We'll see if Anspaugh agrees.
- Dr. Benton?

07:32.351 --> 07:35.115
The patient's grandmother
requested you personally.

07:43.329 --> 07:47.265
Dr. Parks. This is a surprise.
Where's your interpreter?

07:47.467 --> 07:49.401
I can do that. My name is Gwen.

07:49.602 --> 07:51.399
Oh, you can hear.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.376
Grandma thinks I have appendi...

07:57.610 --> 07:59.202
- Appendicitis?
- That's it.

07:59.412 --> 08:01.471
- Where does it hurt?
- Around my bellybutton.

08:01.681 --> 08:02.648
When did it start?

08:02.849 --> 08:06.785
Grandma was driving me to school.
She had to pull over so I could vomit.

08:08.120 --> 08:10.281
I think you have gastroenteritis.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.752
Can you spell that?

08:11.958 --> 08:14.290
I'm sorry. Stomach flu.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.361
You're wrong.

08:18.564 --> 08:21.431
There's no localized tenderness
in the right lower quadrant.

08:22.935 --> 08:25.233
Grandma wants to do the ultrasound.

08:26.272 --> 08:30.072
I'll re-examine her later.
See if the problem declares itself.

08:37.549 --> 08:38.948
What did she say?

08:39.619 --> 08:42.110
She says she wants
to do the ultrasound.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.587
- Fine.
<i>- Fine.</i>

08:49.829 --> 08:52.525
I don't see a splinter.
But there is something.

08:52.732 --> 08:55.758
I'd hate for you to think I made it up
to spend time with you.

08:58.170 --> 09:00.730
That smile is worth
a thousand splinters.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.233
Easy. Got it.

09:04.810 --> 09:06.471
I didn't mean to hurt you.

09:06.979 --> 09:09.447
Make it up to me by
letting me take you out.

09:09.882 --> 09:12.442
- I didn't hurt you that bad.
- You will if you say no.

09:12.652 --> 09:14.051
I don't think so.

09:14.987 --> 09:17.922
- You've decided not to like me.
- I don't even know you.

09:18.124 --> 09:21.116
Right. So we go out,
and you get to know me.

09:21.327 --> 09:23.295
- Officer...
- Call me Reggie.

09:23.496 --> 09:27.125
Reggie, I'm just not looking to go out
with anyone right now.

09:29.168 --> 09:32.831
You know, if it's because you're
HIV-positive, I'm cool with that.

09:33.773 --> 09:35.206
You're cool with that?

09:36.409 --> 09:38.001
Lucky me.

09:40.379 --> 09:41.607
I didn't...

09:42.048 --> 09:44.141
I wasn't talking about sex.

09:44.684 --> 09:46.709
I like to get to know a woman first.

09:46.919 --> 09:50.252
So how about we cross that bridge
if we come to it?

09:53.859 --> 09:56.384
Dr. Weaver, I almost forgot.
Your mom called.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.064
- My mom?
- This morning before I left.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.732
What did she say exactly?

10:00.933 --> 10:03.925
Just that she'd try you again later.

10:04.203 --> 10:06.171
- Am I supposed to get that?
- I got it.

10:06.372 --> 10:08.340
Did she ask for me by name?

10:08.641 --> 10:09.733
Your mom?

10:10.810 --> 10:13.404
<i>Be advised of a commuter plane</i>
<i>crash at Meig's Field.</i>

10:13.613 --> 10:15.774
<i>Anticipating up to 14</i>
<i>trauma patients.</i>

10:15.982 --> 10:17.449
<i>How many can you handle?</i>

10:17.650 --> 10:21.051
We can take three major, seven minor.
Do you have an ETA? Over.

10:21.253 --> 10:24.086
<i>Negative. Awaiting reports</i>
<i>from the scene. Over.</i>

10:24.290 --> 10:26.656
<i>All right. Clear on Med Nine.</i>

10:26.859 --> 10:30.317
We have a mass casualty incident.
Implement disaster protocol.

10:30.529 --> 10:33.657
Set up Curtains 1 and 2, Trauma 2
and 3 for critical patients.

10:33.866 --> 10:37.597
John, will you put IV stands
and gurneys in the hallway?

10:37.803 --> 10:42.331
I need warm saline, rapid infusers, and
O-negative available at every bedside.

10:42.541 --> 10:46.204
I appreciate your work. I don't
think it's appropriate for publication.

10:46.412 --> 10:49.074
How can we effect change
without an open forum?

10:49.281 --> 10:51.306
I support change, Elizabeth.

10:51.517 --> 10:54.486
But I don't believe your paper
is the proper tool.

10:54.687 --> 10:58.384
You object to me mentioning my mistake
because it paints us in a poor light.

10:58.591 --> 11:01.253
No, it paints you in a poor light.

11:01.460 --> 11:04.452
It has a confessional quality
that concerns me.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.963
I suggest you find out the true
motives for writing this paper...

11:08.167 --> 11:11.898
...before you become hell-bent
on sharing it with the world.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.908
Nothing like a multivictim trauma.

11:17.109 --> 11:19.669
I'm Dale Edson,
third-year Surgical Resident.

11:19.879 --> 11:21.676
Lucy IKnight, third-year student.

11:21.881 --> 11:24.543
Working with Carter,
former Surgical Intern.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.945
Wait until you do a Surgical rotation.

11:27.153 --> 11:29.951
It makes emergency medicine
look like child's play.

11:30.156 --> 11:32.283
Here. Let me help you with that.

11:32.491 --> 11:34.516
You ever been on a riverboat casino?

11:34.727 --> 11:35.921
Like in New Orleans?

11:36.128 --> 11:38.961
Like in Elgin. It's a stellar boat,
<i>The Grand Victoria.</i>

11:39.165 --> 11:41.861
I'm heading up there this evening.
Would you like to join me?

11:42.068 --> 11:44.332
I've never been gambling before.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.904
Don't you need to prepare
for Chief rounds tomorrow?

11:48.107 --> 11:50.337
When you're through, check the O-neg.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.273
I can help you on it during
the drive up, if you want.

11:53.479 --> 11:56.107
- That would be great.
- We've got work to do.

11:56.782 --> 11:58.716
It won't be the same without you.

11:58.918 --> 12:00.715
Am I going someplace?

12:01.220 --> 12:03.347
You don't have to play dumb, Doug.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.989
Matt Richmond phoned.

12:05.191 --> 12:07.455
I downplayed you.
I'm not an idiot.

12:07.660 --> 12:10.925
I am, because I have no idea what
you're talking about.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.556
Who's this Richmond guy?

12:14.767 --> 12:17.031
He runs an HMO headquartered
in Portland.

12:17.236 --> 12:20.467
They want someone to set up
pediatric ERs around the country.

12:20.673 --> 12:22.698
Dr. Lee, blood bank's on the phone.

12:22.908 --> 12:25.103
Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.

12:25.311 --> 12:26.903
Glad to hear it.

12:27.213 --> 12:28.805
You applied for the space program?

12:29.014 --> 12:31.676
My second year of Residency.
I made the first cut.

12:31.884 --> 12:32.976
What happened?

12:33.285 --> 12:37.346
Rachel was just barely out of diapers
and Jen was starting law school.

12:37.556 --> 12:38.853
They wouldn't let me defer.

12:39.058 --> 12:42.789
- So that call from NASA could be real.
- I doubt it.

12:43.295 --> 12:46.196
- Trauma Room's ready.
- Great. Thanks, you guys.

12:46.899 --> 12:48.491
You two seem to be moving along.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.999
She's kind of playing hard to get.

12:52.805 --> 12:56.070
Carter, Lucy and Lily will handle
minors in the main hall.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.402
Mark, you and Carol to Trauma One.

12:58.611 --> 13:02.012
IKerry, you and Chuny in Trauma Two.
Lydia and I will float.

13:02.214 --> 13:03.203
<i>Come in, County General.</i>

13:03.415 --> 13:06.384
Jeanie and I will take
critical pedes in Curtain Three.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.518
This is County. Over.

13:08.721 --> 13:11.155
Everybody, Critical pedes,
Curtain Three.

13:11.357 --> 13:14.884
<i>Be advised your facility has been</i>
<i>instructed to stand down. Over.</i>

13:15.094 --> 13:17.790
Come in, Center. We're ready
to handle patients. Over.

13:17.997 --> 13:19.555
- Stand down?
- Stop prepping.

13:19.765 --> 13:24.202
<i>There were no survivors on scene.</i>
<i>Repeat, no survivors. Over.</i>

13:24.637 --> 13:26.605
Copy that, Dispatch.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.747
- Any messages for me?
- And you are...?

13:43.956 --> 13:46.083
Dr. Weaver. Weaver.

13:46.292 --> 13:47.919
One. It sounded important.

13:48.127 --> 13:49.822
- From my mother?
- Your dentist.

13:50.029 --> 13:52.827
Any calls for me, business
or otherwise, page me.

13:53.032 --> 13:54.624
I got you covered. Dr. Greene?

13:54.834 --> 13:59.203
Overnight delivery.
Check out the return address.

13:59.405 --> 14:01.066
"NASA"? You deserting me?

14:01.273 --> 14:03.070
No, of course not.

14:03.609 --> 14:04.701
Got another one behind us.

14:04.910 --> 14:07.071
Okay, I'll take this one. Amanda?

14:07.880 --> 14:10.781
42-year-old female.
Trauma from a collapsed chimney.

14:10.983 --> 14:13.451
- Chimney?
- Possible ALOC. Shortness of breath.

14:13.652 --> 14:14.641
Help me! Help me!

14:14.854 --> 14:16.651
- What's her name?
- Edie Harvelle.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.153
Edie, you're in good hands.

14:18.357 --> 14:21.326
Blunt trauma to the chest and abdomen
from bricks, abdominal pain.

14:21.527 --> 14:24.724
- Vitals?
- BP, 100 palp. Pulse, 110.

14:25.998 --> 14:28.660
On my count. One, two, three.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.297
Pupils equal, react to light.

14:32.104 --> 14:33.935
Go... home.

14:34.139 --> 14:36.300
Tachypneic and tachycardic.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.108
Do you have chest pains?

14:38.310 --> 14:41.473
Pain... everywhere.

14:41.680 --> 14:42.669
BP's 130/82.

14:42.882 --> 14:46.978
Possible pneumothorax. I want a CBC,
chem panel, send off cardiac enzymes.

14:47.186 --> 14:49.814
- We gotta rule out an MI.
- She's young for an MI.

14:50.022 --> 14:53.514
I don't want to take any chances.
Do you mind checking on IKerry?

14:55.494 --> 14:56.791
Pressure's holding at 100.

14:56.996 --> 15:00.397
He's a psychologist.
He was treating your patient.

15:00.599 --> 15:02.726
- What were you treating her for?
- Agoraphobia.

15:02.935 --> 15:05.199
Edie's terrified of public places.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.702
- Including hospitals?
- Pulse ox 98.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.034
I was using
a desensitization approach.

15:10.242 --> 15:14.736
She went outside for the first time
in five years and a chimney fell on us.

15:14.947 --> 15:16.574
Call CT. Right upper quadrant tender.

15:16.782 --> 15:19.046
- Does she have panic attacks?
- 30 a day.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.684
- Great.
- CT can take him now.

15:20.886 --> 15:21.910
Let's get him up.

15:22.121 --> 15:24.988
She has relaxation music with her.
That may help.

15:29.962 --> 15:31.452
EIKG normal.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.495
Lips... numb.

15:33.699 --> 15:38.466
My name is Dr. Greene. You're in
a hospital. Nothing bad can happen.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.662
Hospitals... bad.

15:40.873 --> 15:42.841
Let go of the Walkman.

15:43.075 --> 15:46.772
Haleh, I want you to try
and find a Yanni tape.

15:48.580 --> 15:49.945
IKeep breathing.

15:53.085 --> 15:58.250
All right. Yeah, there's fluid around
the edematous appendix. E-D-E...

15:59.024 --> 16:00.286
Mom!

16:05.030 --> 16:05.997
That's my mom.

16:06.198 --> 16:09.429
She was on a field trip with her
students while Grandma called.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.032
- What does this mean?
- Father.

16:13.238 --> 16:15.706
She says you're
the father of the deaf boy.

16:15.941 --> 16:19.377
Do me a favor. Tell your mother
and grandmother... Never mind.

16:20.379 --> 16:22.279
Hey. Hey, excuse me.

16:22.915 --> 16:24.849
Listen, she...

16:28.454 --> 16:31.287
<i>- Appendi</i> x <i>?</i>
- Appendix. Yeah, yeah, right.

16:37.396 --> 16:38.624
I'm gonna have an operation?

16:38.831 --> 16:40.492
Yeah. But it's fine.

16:43.936 --> 16:47.303
Mom needs a signer.
Grandma's not a surgeon.

16:47.506 --> 16:51.465
I need to ask questions.
The hospital needs to provide one.

16:52.277 --> 16:55.041
Yeah. Look, I'll take
care of it. It's no problem.

16:57.116 --> 16:58.743
Am I gonna be okay?

16:58.951 --> 17:00.441
You're gonna be fine.

17:00.652 --> 17:04.053
Edie, this mask will help you breathe.

17:04.256 --> 17:05.621
Just inhale like this.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.347
Nice and easy.

17:07.559 --> 17:09.823
- Mask off!
- No, no, no. Mask on.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.053
Mask off!

17:18.470 --> 17:20.836
Bad news. CT's down.

17:22.775 --> 17:27.269
I don't want to put her on sedation
until we rule out intracranial bleed.

17:27.479 --> 17:30.505
- We may have no choice.
- Let me try something.

17:31.650 --> 17:33.049
Okay, Edie.

17:34.253 --> 17:35.982
I want you to close your eyes.

17:36.188 --> 17:37.678
- I can't.
- Sure you can.

17:38.957 --> 17:40.356
Close your eyes.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.756
I want you to imagine yourself
as a little girl...

17:44.029 --> 17:46.361
...someplace warm and safe.

17:46.565 --> 17:49.033
- It's dark.
- No, it's not.

17:49.234 --> 17:50.223
Close your eyes.

17:50.436 --> 17:52.370
It's light and it's airy.

17:52.638 --> 17:55.038
And it's warm and it's safe.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.269
Can you tell me where you are?

17:59.278 --> 18:00.745
IKitchen.

18:02.414 --> 18:03.506
Who's with you there?

18:05.417 --> 18:06.509
- Mom.
- Your mom.

18:06.718 --> 18:08.515
She's baking something.

18:08.720 --> 18:09.948
It smells really yummy.

18:10.889 --> 18:12.254
Can you tell me what she's baking?

18:13.992 --> 18:16.790
- Cookies.
- Cookies. Very good.

18:18.864 --> 18:20.297
That's good.

18:24.470 --> 18:25.960
That's good.

18:28.674 --> 18:31.040
I'm sorry if I offended you earlier.

18:31.243 --> 18:32.073
Don't worry.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.677
I'm thinking of something
to tell you to make it even.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.610
- It's not necessary.
- How I'm broke or got suspended once.

18:37.816 --> 18:39.306
It's not that simple.

18:39.518 --> 18:42.510
Nothing in my life compares to what
you're going through.

18:42.721 --> 18:45.189
Don't feel sorry for me.
I'm doing great.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.156
Where did you learn that?

18:48.360 --> 18:50.225
I did research on phobias in school.

18:50.429 --> 18:54.126
I actually got published in
the <i>Cornell Medical Journal.</i>

18:54.333 --> 18:56.961
I'd love to read it.
Do you still have a copy?

18:57.169 --> 18:59.535
- Filed in a box somewhere.
- Ambulance pulling up.

18:59.738 --> 19:03.765
I'll take that. It's poorly written
psychobabble. You'd be bored.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.409
I doubt it.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.301
Carol!

19:08.514 --> 19:11.039
I just got the labs
back on Joi Abbott.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.411
The woman who fainted
in the cafeteria.

19:13.619 --> 19:15.450
She has microcytic anemia.

19:15.654 --> 19:16.916
Give her iron. She'll be fine.

19:17.122 --> 19:19.317
Well, I doubt it. Her son has ALD.

19:19.525 --> 19:21.015
- How old is he?
- Eight. Why?

19:21.226 --> 19:23.160
They usually don't make it past 10.

19:23.362 --> 19:26.195
He had an older brother who died
of it three years ago.

19:26.398 --> 19:29.629
It's X-linked. Inherited from
the mother. It only strikes boys.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.769
No wonder Joi looks like hell.

19:31.970 --> 19:35.406
- Simon says, "Fly like a bird!"
- I can't believe you paged me for this.

19:35.607 --> 19:39.338
When a child acts out, it's usually
an indication of a bigger problem.

19:39.545 --> 19:42.343
If Reece bit a kid,
he was probably provoked.

19:42.548 --> 19:45.847
Actually, this isn't the first time
he's disrupted class.

19:46.051 --> 19:49.578
Yesterday Reece threw a fit
when it was sing-along time...

19:49.788 --> 19:51.779
...and he wanted to continue painting.

19:52.224 --> 19:54.089
Maybe because he can't sing along.

19:54.293 --> 19:58.730
We don't have the personnel to let
each child do their own activities.

19:58.931 --> 20:02.833
I already spend extra time
talking to him and making sure...

20:03.035 --> 20:06.698
Okay, okay, listen, listen,
what do you want me to do?

20:07.706 --> 20:10.197
Perhaps he needs
a special-needs environment...

20:10.409 --> 20:12.934
...where he'll get more
personal attention.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.113
It may be the best
for all concerned.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.678
- Good breath sounds bilaterally.
- You're doing awesome.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.945
Fetal heart tones present at 140.

20:23.155 --> 20:24.679
Are you feeling any pain here?

20:24.890 --> 20:26.983
Only with the contractions.
Is our baby okay?

20:27.192 --> 20:29.558
- So far, so good.
- Hemoglobin is 12.8.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.130
- What have we got?
- Robin Gambrell, 28.

20:32.331 --> 20:35.164
Restrained front-seat passenger,
involved in a two-car MVA.

20:35.367 --> 20:37.267
Full-term and she's in active labor.

20:37.469 --> 20:40.927
It was my fault. I shouldn't
have been driving so fast.

20:41.473 --> 20:44.374
They brought the other victim.
I think they need you next door.

20:46.945 --> 20:49.778
Hope that guy's okay.
Never saw him coming.

20:50.148 --> 20:53.481
We're gonna have to do a pelvic exam
before we bring you up to OB.

20:53.685 --> 20:55.550
Mike, did you hurt your back?

20:55.754 --> 20:57.551
Don't worry about me, baby.

20:57.756 --> 21:02.386
Let's get a trauma panel
on Mr. Gambrell for kidney damage.

21:02.594 --> 21:04.926
Oh, here comes another one!

21:05.130 --> 21:07.564
Okay, baby. Breathe.
Breathe through the pain.

21:07.866 --> 21:10.334
Aaron Drane.
He's a private in the Army.

21:10.535 --> 21:12.935
- BP's 60.
- Could be intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

21:13.138 --> 21:15.606
I need a peritoneal lavage kit.
Prep the belly.

21:15.807 --> 21:17.365
Another two units of O-neg.

21:17.576 --> 21:18.474
Heart rate's 130.

21:18.677 --> 21:22.511
All right, Lucy. Hook up the adapter
to the syringe.

21:24.449 --> 21:27.475
Okay, I'm in.
Pull back on the syringe.

21:28.020 --> 21:28.918
Gross blood.

21:30.689 --> 21:32.179
- V-fib.
- Crash cart!

21:33.458 --> 21:34.447
Charge to 200.

21:36.261 --> 21:37.319
Clear!

21:41.033 --> 21:42.728
Do you know how to use the Internet?

21:42.934 --> 21:44.868
My middle initials are "WWW."

21:45.070 --> 21:50.007
I'm trying to find an article on the
<i>Cornell Medical School Journal</i> site.

21:51.410 --> 21:55.676
You got back slashes instead of forward
slashes. Common beginner's mistake.

21:55.881 --> 21:57.746
- Author's name?
- Amanda Lee.

21:57.949 --> 22:00.110
Subject would be "phobias."

22:02.454 --> 22:05.582
A.W. Lee wrote something
called "Fearing Fear."

22:05.791 --> 22:07.884
- Could you print that?
- Already did.

22:08.093 --> 22:10.687
Oh. Listen, call down
to the library...

22:10.896 --> 22:14.297
...and have them send up any articles
by the same author.

22:14.499 --> 22:16.558
Hey, for you, Dr. G.

22:16.868 --> 22:17.926
One more time.

22:18.236 --> 22:19.760
Charge to 50.

22:19.971 --> 22:21.802
- Charging.
- Clear.

22:24.776 --> 22:25.868
Still asystole.

22:26.478 --> 22:29.208
Me and some friends
were hanging out after my shift...

22:29.414 --> 22:32.042
...when Robin called and told me
that her water broke.

22:32.250 --> 22:34.081
I kind of freaked out.

22:34.386 --> 22:36.616
That's common with first-time dads.

22:36.922 --> 22:40.756
Mike's been working doubles so he can
take time off after the baby's born.

22:40.959 --> 22:42.950
I don't want Robin going
through this alone.

22:43.161 --> 22:45.152
Sounds like you'll make great parents.

22:45.364 --> 22:48.527
That's a good-Iooking baby.
Placenta looks fine.

22:49.801 --> 22:50.893
Thank you, God.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.366
How's the other driver doing?

22:56.007 --> 22:58.100
Everything's fine, baby.

22:58.343 --> 22:59.640
Don't worry.

23:02.914 --> 23:06.350
"This time, with the wind aft,
and a good one...

23:06.551 --> 23:09.349
...the swallow fairly raced
to the island...

23:09.554 --> 23:11.647
...with her wing..."
- Hi, Joi.

23:12.290 --> 23:14.815
I'm sorry I couldn't make it
back down.

23:15.026 --> 23:16.891
I decided to come to you instead.

23:17.095 --> 23:18.084
That's nice of you.

23:18.296 --> 23:20.662
This must be Ricky. I'm Carol.

23:22.367 --> 23:24.267
He just started having trouble talking.

23:24.469 --> 23:26.903
He used to be such a chatterbox.

23:28.640 --> 23:31.268
So I got some terrible disease too?

23:31.476 --> 23:33.706
Your blood test confirmed
you're anemic.

23:33.912 --> 23:37.211
If you take these iron pills,
you'll feel a lot better.

23:38.183 --> 23:42.176
I'd like you to come back in three
weeks so I can recheck your blood.

23:42.387 --> 23:44.787
It's hard for me to plan
that far ahead.

23:45.190 --> 23:47.784
Time to eat. I got chocolate today.

23:49.628 --> 23:51.823
Do you have any help with Ricky?

23:52.030 --> 23:53.395
My daughter, Celia, plays with him.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.294
I was actually thinking more
medically.

23:57.936 --> 23:59.301
I take care of all that.

23:59.504 --> 24:01.335
I could arrange for respite care.

24:01.540 --> 24:04.737
Someone who could watch Ricky
a couple hours a day...

24:04.943 --> 24:07.207
...while you regain your strength.

24:07.412 --> 24:11.348
I appreciate the offer,
but Ricky's my responsibility.

24:13.518 --> 24:15.611
If you don't take care of yourself...

24:15.821 --> 24:18.483
...you won't be much help
to him or your daughter either.

24:20.425 --> 24:23.189
It's my job to see him through this.

24:38.343 --> 24:40.106
Good effort in there, Amanda.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.212
You win some, you lose some.

24:42.948 --> 24:46.440
I was trying to find your
journal article, and I found this:

24:46.651 --> 24:50.451
Written by A.W. Lee, picture
of 40-year-old Asian guy.

24:50.655 --> 24:52.714
He was a classmate of mine at Cornell.

24:52.924 --> 24:57.486
And not a very good one. People were
constantly getting us mixed up.

24:57.696 --> 25:00.426
You wrote the article, but they
printed his photo.

25:00.632 --> 25:03.601
They printed a correction
in the next issue.

25:03.802 --> 25:07.704
And this was on the Internet.
A global source of misinformation.

25:07.906 --> 25:12.639
Why don't you get the editor of the
<i>Cornell Journal of Medicine</i> for me?

25:12.844 --> 25:14.471
It's really not necessary.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.909
You should get credit for your work.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.672
Where's Cornell?

25:22.587 --> 25:23.611
Yes, officer?

25:23.822 --> 25:26.052
I'm following up on the MVA.

25:26.258 --> 25:29.318
Mrs. Gambrell and the baby
are doing fine.

25:29.528 --> 25:33.396
Unfortunately, the driver
of the other car expired.

25:33.598 --> 25:38.535
And Michael Gambrell, the driver
who caused the accident?

25:38.737 --> 25:40.830
Just some minor cuts and abrasions.

25:41.039 --> 25:44.634
He was driving erratically.
Did you get a blood alcohol on him?

25:44.843 --> 25:46.811
Just a CBC and a chem panel.

25:47.012 --> 25:48.445
Can you get a B.A.L. Off that?

25:48.647 --> 25:52.083
- I don't think that's necessary.
- It's standard procedure.

25:52.284 --> 25:54.411
I can take him down to the station...

25:55.186 --> 25:58.053
- I'll add it to his orders.
- Appreciate it.

26:01.593 --> 26:03.652
Just try and relax, Mr. Wong.

26:03.862 --> 26:05.090
Pulse ox 87.

26:05.297 --> 26:08.824
- I can't find the radial artery.
- Try a brachial stick.

26:09.034 --> 26:10.365
I've got a pulse.

26:10.835 --> 26:12.427
Mr. Wong, I'm gonna stick you now.

26:16.875 --> 26:17.967
I'm getting blood.

26:18.176 --> 26:19.939
All it takes is a little practice.

26:24.482 --> 26:26.814
- Lily, take over for Lucy.
- Dr. Carter?

26:27.018 --> 26:29.179
Go to the Suture Room
and flush out the wound.

26:38.029 --> 26:41.260
- Sounds like an astronaut to me.
- It's not like I'm gonna fly it.

26:41.466 --> 26:44.833
- What's a payload specialist do?
- On-board experiments.

26:45.036 --> 26:49.336
A guy I went to school with is heading
up a medical team for next year.

26:49.541 --> 26:51.441
That's some pretty intense training.

26:51.643 --> 26:53.543
I'm not physically in shape?

26:53.745 --> 26:57.044
They let John Glenn back up there,
and he's, what, in his late 70s?

26:57.248 --> 26:58.647
Thanks, Carol.

26:59.417 --> 27:01.851
Sounds like the opportunity
of a lifetime.

27:02.053 --> 27:04.647
It's not like you have Rachel
and Jen to tie you down.

27:04.856 --> 27:05.948
"Tie him down"?

27:06.157 --> 27:08.250
It's not like I was looking for it.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.257
Yo, Dr. G.

27:11.262 --> 27:14.322
Those A.W. Lee articles you wanted?
They're checked out.

27:14.532 --> 27:16.523
- All of them? By who?
- I didn't ask.

27:16.735 --> 27:18.225
- When?
- Didn't ask.

27:19.270 --> 27:22.205
Did that editor from Cornell
return my call?

27:22.407 --> 27:25.865
Listen, check with the library
and see what else you can find out.

27:26.077 --> 27:28.773
- Donald, can I talk to you?
- I'm late for surgery, Mark.

27:28.980 --> 27:32.313
Do you know anybody over
at the Cornell Medical School?

27:32.517 --> 27:35.748
Why don't you talk to Dr. Lee?
That's her alma mater.

27:35.954 --> 27:37.615
You never spoke to anybody about her?

27:37.822 --> 27:41.417
I didn't see the need. Her letters
of recommendation were glowing.

27:41.626 --> 27:42.820
Yes, they were.

27:43.028 --> 27:47.624
And an old Army buddy of mine said
she's the best Resident he's ever had.

27:47.832 --> 27:49.060
That's good to hear.

27:49.267 --> 27:52.498
- Lf there's a problem...?
- No. Sorry to bother you.

27:53.171 --> 27:55.969
CT just called. They're ready
for the freaky <i>chica.</i>

27:56.174 --> 27:59.735
Why don't you stick with me?
I may need your transpo expertise.

28:04.482 --> 28:07.110
Lucy, I am so sorry.

28:07.452 --> 28:08.714
It was an accident.

28:08.920 --> 28:11.718
I should've warned the patient
that I was gonna stick him.

28:11.923 --> 28:14.414
Like you said, risk comes
with the job.

28:16.561 --> 28:17.550
What do I do?

28:17.762 --> 28:21.357
We'll send a sample of his blood
down to the lab for a rapid HIV test.

28:21.566 --> 28:22.794
Without his permission?

28:23.001 --> 28:25.936
Yes, since we already have a sample.

28:26.438 --> 28:29.601
And if he turns
out to be HIV-positive...

28:29.808 --> 28:31.901
...which I'm sure he won't...

28:32.811 --> 28:35.405
...then we'll tell him
the test results.

28:36.181 --> 28:39.116
If he's positive, I'm gonna have
to start prophylaxis.

28:39.317 --> 28:42.650
Well, let's just take this
one step at time. Okay?

28:43.555 --> 28:44.715
Okay.

28:48.359 --> 28:49.656
Hasn't the interpreter arrived?

28:49.861 --> 28:52.989
The nurse says she's busy.
Another one is driving in.

28:53.198 --> 28:56.690
Okay. You know, we really
shouldn't wait on this.

29:00.438 --> 29:02.030
She said okay.

29:03.875 --> 29:07.003
- Grandma wants to watch.
- No, no, it's not necessary.

29:09.481 --> 29:11.381
Okay, okay, fine.

29:13.184 --> 29:14.481
I love you.

29:15.687 --> 29:17.450
I love you both.

29:20.058 --> 29:23.221
We're gonna be in and out
of there in less than 20 minutes.

29:23.428 --> 29:25.487
- Don't leave.
- I'm right here.

29:25.697 --> 29:28.097
- How's it look?
- The coast is clear, captain.

29:28.299 --> 29:32.030
Why don't you close your eyes
and imagine yourself in...

29:32.237 --> 29:33.499
...outer space.

29:33.705 --> 29:36.606
- What?
- You're floating around the galaxy...

29:36.808 --> 29:38.833
...in the black expanse.

29:39.043 --> 29:42.012
Earth is a tiny speck
in the distance. Okay?

29:42.213 --> 29:45.341
- Are there cookies?
- Sure, they have cookies in space.

29:45.550 --> 29:46.881
Wash them down with Tang.

29:47.085 --> 29:49.781
Coming through! I need blood now!

29:49.988 --> 29:51.319
Don't... let... me...!

29:51.523 --> 29:53.514
Let's go back. We're gonna go back.

29:55.593 --> 29:58.892
Let's take her back.
We're gonna take you back.

30:01.666 --> 30:05.796
We've been waiting for over 45 minutes
and no one will tell us about our son.

30:06.004 --> 30:07.562
I'm sure the doctor's tied up.

30:07.772 --> 30:09.797
I want to know about my son!

30:10.008 --> 30:11.168
What's going on?

30:11.376 --> 30:13.003
What's your son's name?

30:13.211 --> 30:15.873
Aaron Drane.
He's a private in the U.S. Army.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.638
He was in a car accident.

30:17.849 --> 30:20.249
I don't know,
but let me see if I can find out.

30:20.451 --> 30:22.715
He was home on leave,
driving back to base.

30:22.921 --> 30:25.913
Look, we're gonna go back there!
You can't stop us.

30:26.124 --> 30:28.649
Mr. Drane, Mrs. Drane,
I'm Officer Moore.

30:28.860 --> 30:32.387
I'm very sorry, but your son, Aaron,
was very seriously injured...

30:32.597 --> 30:34.189
...and he died.

30:35.800 --> 30:38.462
The doctors here did everything
they could to save him.

30:50.548 --> 30:52.140
What are you doing in here?

30:52.350 --> 30:55.945
I'm cutting out some fascinating
articles on Conn's Syndrome.

30:56.154 --> 30:58.019
Aren't those hospital copies?

30:58.223 --> 30:59.713
Yeah, they were extras.

30:59.924 --> 31:02.358
Unfortunately, I have to cancel
on tonight.

31:02.560 --> 31:05.393
This migraine's like a train
running through my head.

31:05.597 --> 31:07.064
Have you ever tried just...?

31:07.265 --> 31:10.359
You name it, I've tried it.
I think the best thing...

31:10.568 --> 31:13.366
...is to go home and pull
the covers over my head.

31:13.571 --> 31:15.664
But Mark and I
will definitely reschedule.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.432
- Okay.
- Okay.

31:18.676 --> 31:20.200
Oh, Dr. Weaver.

31:20.478 --> 31:22.639
Mike Gambrell's blood alcohol
came back.

31:22.847 --> 31:25.372
- .086.
- He's just over the limit.

31:25.583 --> 31:26.743
Not good at all.

31:26.951 --> 31:30.079
I'm okay.
Nothing bad can happen to me.

31:30.288 --> 31:31.755
I am in control.

31:31.956 --> 31:35.448
Just keep nice, positive thoughts.
That's good.

31:35.660 --> 31:38.493
I am in control. I am okay.

31:38.696 --> 31:40.596
- How weird is that?
- What?!

31:40.798 --> 31:45.633
We're just gonna wait for the
next elevator because this one's full.

31:45.837 --> 31:51.036
All right, there it is. One inflamed
appy with fibrinous exudate.

31:51.843 --> 31:53.936
I've never come across a deaf doctor.

31:54.145 --> 31:56.238
Quite an amazing feat she pulled off.

31:56.614 --> 31:58.104
Preparing to clamp.

31:58.316 --> 31:59.715
How did she manage a Residency?

31:59.918 --> 32:03.786
Especially a Surgical rotation
with a mask on, her hands occupied?

32:06.357 --> 32:07.949
She can't read our lips.

32:08.159 --> 32:11.026
It's rude to talk about her
when she's right in front of us.

32:13.765 --> 32:14.789
You're absolutely right.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.360
My apologies.

32:18.569 --> 32:20.400
Where have you been?

32:20.605 --> 32:24.507
I was helping Dr. G. Get a patient
to CT. It was no picnic.

32:24.709 --> 32:26.939
He wanted this Cornell call.
I should find him.

32:27.145 --> 32:30.046
- I'm heading that way.
- I owe you one.

32:33.251 --> 32:36.618
Look, he had a couple of beers
with no intention of driving.

32:36.821 --> 32:38.550
Then his wife called in labor.

32:38.756 --> 32:42.852
- He killed a man.
- He's willing to take responsibility.

32:43.061 --> 32:45.655
He wants to stay with his wife
through delivery.

32:45.863 --> 32:48.661
I don't like this,
but my job is to arrest him now.

32:48.866 --> 32:51.699
Should his wife and child
have to pay as well?

32:56.708 --> 32:59.643
He can stay until she delivers.
Then I'm taking him in.

32:59.844 --> 33:01.812
Thank you. Thanks.

33:03.114 --> 33:06.675
Great news. Mr. Wong's test results
came back. He's negative.

33:06.884 --> 33:09.978
- Are you sure?
- I went to the lab myself to confirm.

33:10.188 --> 33:13.487
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you so much.

33:13.691 --> 33:15.591
I'm the one that got you into this.

33:15.793 --> 33:17.886
I appreciate you sticking through it.

33:18.096 --> 33:21.395
I still want you to get tested again
in six months, just to be safe.

33:21.599 --> 33:22.588
Absolutely.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.962
Man, I'm so relieved!

33:26.170 --> 33:27.603
Tell me about it!

33:29.540 --> 33:30.370
Done?

33:30.908 --> 33:33.502
You passed with flying colors.
I'll be right in.

33:33.711 --> 33:35.645
Go ahead and process those.

33:43.187 --> 33:46.247
- I am okay.
- Yes, you are.

33:46.457 --> 33:50.689
The scan confirmed that there's
no bleeding in the brain.

33:51.929 --> 33:55.990
Edie, if you want me to unstrap you,
you'll have to let go of my hand.

33:57.201 --> 33:59.294
I thought you were different.

33:59.971 --> 34:03.372
I thought you understood the real me.
Obviously, I was mistaken.

34:03.574 --> 34:05.974
- Amanda, what's going on?
- Unstrap.

34:08.579 --> 34:10.945
I'm a fine doctor.
I have what it takes.

34:11.149 --> 34:13.379
- I know.
- Then why did you doubt me?!

34:14.752 --> 34:18.085
If this is about the article,
we can talk...

34:18.755 --> 34:20.587
- Why is this door locked?
- Locked?

34:21.759 --> 34:24.556
I loved you more than any man
has a right to be loved.

34:24.762 --> 34:25.751
What?

34:25.963 --> 34:28.056
I never expected to feel like this.

34:28.266 --> 34:29.755
I hate feeling like this!

34:29.967 --> 34:33.766
I don't know what you're talking
about! If you'll open the door...

34:33.971 --> 34:35.063
Please!

34:35.273 --> 34:37.571
It's too painful for me
to be near you.

34:38.275 --> 34:39.833
Can we talk about this?

34:42.280 --> 34:44.407
Can't breathe!

34:44.715 --> 34:47.809
It's all right. It's okay,
keep breathing.

34:48.018 --> 34:49.748
Amanda, I want to understand.

34:49.954 --> 34:51.614
It's too late for that, Mark.

34:52.889 --> 34:54.083
It's over.

34:57.027 --> 34:59.155
But I will never forget you.

35:03.868 --> 35:05.028
Amanda, wait.

35:05.670 --> 35:07.695
Amanda, wait! Let us out of here!

35:07.905 --> 35:09.896
Dying!

35:16.180 --> 35:18.580
- They were locked in there how long?
- An hour.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.216
The tech took a long lunch.

35:20.418 --> 35:22.682
- Have they found Dr. Lee?
- Still missing.

35:22.887 --> 35:27.551
Get this. Amanda Lee, also known as
Barbara Hardin and Janice Engelhart.

35:27.758 --> 35:30.192
- She never even got her MD.
- She's not a real doctor?

35:30.394 --> 35:31.361
Unbelievable!

35:31.562 --> 35:34.326
She stole A.W. Lee's
medical school transcripts...

35:34.532 --> 35:37.000
...and used them to get into
a Residency program.

35:37.201 --> 35:40.136
- Why didn't I think of that?
- It's not her first time.

35:40.338 --> 35:43.330
She also posed as a lawyer
and an architect.

35:43.541 --> 35:45.270
Think how many patients she treated.

35:45.476 --> 35:47.171
We'll have a huge liability.

35:47.378 --> 35:49.039
I thought she was a good doctor.

35:49.247 --> 35:52.114
- She certainly had me fooled.
- Me too.

35:54.585 --> 35:56.780
I wonder if my job offer was made up.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.319
What job offer?

36:00.258 --> 36:01.555
Edie?

36:02.593 --> 36:05.323
Dr. Greene, I want to thank you.

36:05.530 --> 36:08.966
For what? Getting you held hostage
by a crazed lunatic?

36:09.233 --> 36:12.532
I haven't felt this good in years.

36:12.737 --> 36:13.795
That's great.

36:14.005 --> 36:18.669
I mean, if I can survive this
hellhole, I can survive anything.

36:20.344 --> 36:21.504
Can I call you a cab?

36:23.147 --> 36:26.878
I think I'm just gonna walk.

36:30.188 --> 36:33.214
Cervix is at seven centimeters.
Shouldn't be long.

36:33.424 --> 36:35.153
We'll get you upstairs right now.

36:35.359 --> 36:36.849
Is that him? Is that the guy?

36:37.061 --> 36:38.050
I'm treating a patient!

36:38.262 --> 36:41.322
- That son of a bitch killed my son!
- Oh, my God!

36:41.532 --> 36:42.521
I'm sorry.

36:43.167 --> 36:45.192
I didn't mean for this to happen.

36:46.070 --> 36:47.230
Arrest him!

36:47.438 --> 36:49.269
The baby's heart rate is slowing.

36:49.473 --> 36:51.168
- Don't leave me.
- I'm right here.

36:51.375 --> 36:55.311
He wants to see his wife through labor.
He only needs a few more hours.

36:55.746 --> 36:58.510
I would have liked a few more hours
with my son.

37:00.651 --> 37:02.312
I've gotta do this.

37:05.256 --> 37:07.486
You should go with the officer.

37:07.992 --> 37:11.655
You can post bail. Hopefully, you'll
be back before the birth.

37:11.862 --> 37:12.920
I'm not leaving.

37:13.130 --> 37:15.223
- I think you have to.
- No, he doesn't.

37:16.434 --> 37:18.698
We're gonna take
very good care of her.

37:40.691 --> 37:42.090
Good pickup.

37:43.728 --> 37:45.923
How do you think she's gotten
away with it?

37:46.130 --> 37:49.691
Obviously Dr. Lee's a first-class
pathological liar.

37:50.334 --> 37:53.098
ER. If you're sick,
we'll fix you quick.

37:58.943 --> 38:00.103
Hey, Dale.

38:03.581 --> 38:06.448
Listen, Lucy's a good kid.

38:06.651 --> 38:08.744
So try to be nice.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.113
I'm always nice.

38:10.688 --> 38:12.883
She told me about
getting needle-stuck.

38:13.557 --> 38:15.548
The guy tested HIV-negative, right?

38:16.160 --> 38:17.627
Yeah. Thank God.

38:17.828 --> 38:20.956
I'll say. It means I got a chance
at scoring tonight.

38:21.165 --> 38:23.793
Do you have a lucky number
you want me to bet on?

38:24.769 --> 38:25.827
No, thanks.

38:26.037 --> 38:28.062
- I'm not feeling lucky tonight.
- I am.

38:29.106 --> 38:30.403
Shall we, Lucy?

38:34.845 --> 38:37.109
Yes, if I must.

38:39.050 --> 38:42.986
I'm trying to apprise the CEO about
Dr. Lee, and he puts me on hold.

38:43.821 --> 38:48.349
I thought you should know. A patient
died under hers and my care today.

38:50.928 --> 38:53.192
That's just what I didn't
need to hear.

38:53.931 --> 38:57.458
However, I don't believe either of us
made any errors.

38:57.668 --> 39:00.865
The hospital attorneys
will want to speak to you about it.

39:01.806 --> 39:04.798
I've also been thinking about
what you said earlier...

39:05.676 --> 39:08.907
...and I intend to pursue
the publication of my paper.

39:09.580 --> 39:12.947
Yes, I'm here.
Can you hold one second, please?

39:14.151 --> 39:16.779
Well, in light
of the Amanda Lee debacle...

39:16.987 --> 39:19.387
...it's obvious none of us
are above reproach.

39:21.258 --> 39:22.885
I admire your directness.

39:25.329 --> 39:29.231
Give me a list of the journals
and I'll attach a cover letter.

39:31.102 --> 39:32.296
Thank you, Donald.

39:32.870 --> 39:34.667
Yeah. Where were we?

39:35.539 --> 39:36.904
- How are we doing?
- She's crowning.

39:38.175 --> 39:40.541
Mike's not gonna make it, is he?

39:40.745 --> 39:43.908
No, but we're gonna get
through this, Robin, okay?

39:44.115 --> 39:48.051
Take a deep breath and push.
There you go.

39:48.252 --> 39:49.583
I'm guiding the head out.

39:49.787 --> 39:53.279
Deep breath and push again. Good.

39:53.524 --> 39:56.789
Mark's made some bad choices in women,
but he outdid himself this time.

39:56.994 --> 39:58.757
I knew there was something off.

39:58.963 --> 40:00.396
I don't want to talk about it.

40:00.598 --> 40:02.429
Can I just ask you a question?

40:02.633 --> 40:04.533
Was the fire escape thing for real?

40:04.735 --> 40:06.532
What fire escape?

40:06.737 --> 40:08.136
Never mind.

40:09.673 --> 40:11.197
Think we should open it?

40:12.042 --> 40:15.068
- Too thin to be a bomb.
- What is it?

40:15.279 --> 40:18.612
"This is for you. It is a poem
you inspired me to write.

40:18.816 --> 40:22.582
<i>Because two bodies naked and entwined</i>
<i>Leap over time</i>

40:22.787 --> 40:24.311
<i>They are invulnerable</i>
<i>Nothing can touch them. "</i>

40:24.555 --> 40:26.648
They return to the source.

40:26.857 --> 40:27.789
<i>"There is no you</i>

40:27.992 --> 40:29.584
<i>No I</i>

40:29.794 --> 40:32.228
<i>- No tomorrow. "</i>
<i>- No tomorrow.</i>

40:32.663 --> 40:34.790
Octavio Paz, my favorite poet.

40:37.601 --> 40:39.034
There you go.

40:39.703 --> 40:41.568
You inspired her to plagiarize.

40:41.772 --> 40:43.262
Just go.

40:45.709 --> 40:46.971
So dinner for three?

40:47.178 --> 40:49.442
- I'm gonna hit the gym first.
- Carol?

40:49.647 --> 40:50.545
I thought I'd missed you.

40:50.748 --> 40:52.443
Hey, Joi. Is something wrong?

40:52.650 --> 40:56.882
I've been thinking about what you
said about respite care.

40:57.154 --> 40:59.918
And my daughter has a dance
recital next week.

41:00.124 --> 41:02.456
It would mean a lot to her
if I was there.

41:02.660 --> 41:05.493
I'll make some calls first thing
in the morning.

41:05.696 --> 41:07.459
- I'd appreciate that.
- How are you?

41:07.665 --> 41:09.292
Fine.

41:09.967 --> 41:11.662
He's got a little conjunctivitis.

41:11.869 --> 41:14.997
I meant to have the doctor
upstairs take a look.

41:15.206 --> 41:19.165
I'll write him a prescription for
gentamicin. It'll get him cleared up.

41:35.226 --> 41:36.818
This is getting ridiculous.

41:37.027 --> 41:40.121
I was coming by to see the Gambrell
wife and baby.

41:40.331 --> 41:42.925
Both mother and daughter are fine.

41:43.133 --> 41:45.294
I'll call in and have them
tell the dad.

41:46.170 --> 41:48.695
It's a shame. He was not a bad guy.

41:48.906 --> 41:51.340
Just made one really dumb mistake.

41:51.609 --> 41:53.668
Yeah, you're right. It is a shame.

41:56.614 --> 41:58.775
- You have a good one.
- Hey, Reggie.

42:00.384 --> 42:03.842
I've got plans tonight. You want
to catch a movie tomorrow night?

42:05.723 --> 42:07.213
Let me think about it.

42:08.192 --> 42:09.523
Okay.

42:09.994 --> 42:11.018
Okay.

42:12.396 --> 42:13.385
- Good night.
- Good night.

42:20.271 --> 42:22.171
- Hey, Dr. Weaver.
- Hey.

42:24.308 --> 42:27.607
- INH.
- You've converted, huh?

42:27.811 --> 42:30.541
Hey, your mom, she never called back.

42:30.748 --> 42:32.545
My mom's dead.

42:32.816 --> 42:35.080
I was adopted.

42:35.719 --> 42:38.153
It's possible that call
was from my birth mother.

42:38.355 --> 42:41.256
Wow! I didn't know.

42:41.458 --> 42:44.894
Yeah, well, probably a wrong number.
A false alarm.

42:45.996 --> 42:47.054
Have you been looking?

42:47.598 --> 42:49.725
I put my name on the Internet
a month ago.

42:51.468 --> 42:56.337
My parents... My adopted parents have
been gone about a year now, so...

42:56.740 --> 42:59.208
I'd think that there'd be agencies...

42:59.410 --> 43:00.434
Yeah, there are.

43:02.346 --> 43:03.608
There are.

43:04.715 --> 43:07.115
Go on. It's Friday night.

43:08.152 --> 43:10.052
I'll miss my curtain if I don't go.

43:10.788 --> 43:13.188
- Have a good time.
- Okay, thanks.

43:21.198 --> 43:22.392
Hey.

43:24.668 --> 43:25.965
What's happening, Reece?

43:29.740 --> 43:30.798
What?

43:35.613 --> 43:37.137
Hey, you know who I am?

43:38.616 --> 43:40.709
Do you know who I am? Who am I?

43:41.318 --> 43:43.047
Can you say "father"?

43:44.488 --> 43:46.786
Come on, man. Let me show you. Look.

43:46.991 --> 43:49.391
Can you say "daddy"?

43:50.027 --> 43:51.995
See what I learned? "Daddy." See?

43:52.596 --> 43:54.063
Come on, Reece.

43:55.899 --> 43:57.423
Never mind.

44:00.638 --> 44:02.663
Yeah! Hey...!

44:04.508 --> 44:06.066
Hey, man!

44:15.753 --> 44:16.845
That's it.
