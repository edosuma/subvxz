00:07.875 --> 00:08.976
MAN (over TV):
One month ago,

00:09.009 --> 00:12.046
12 couples arrived
on this tropical island.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.182
After an emergency
balloon landing,

00:14.215 --> 00:16.984
a jellyfish explosion
and the most-viewed

00:17.017 --> 00:20.988
cantaloupe catapult accident
of all time,

00:21.021 --> 00:23.023
just four couples remain.

00:23.057 --> 00:26.160
I'm Tag Tuckerbag, and this
is the greatest adventure

00:26.194 --> 00:28.429
to take place in just one place.

00:28.462 --> 00:29.997
-TAG: The Amazing Place!
-SIMPSONS: The Amazing Place!

00:30.030 --> 00:31.865
The Place Show.

00:31.899 --> 00:35.236
LISA: The final challenge
is the Lily Pad Leap.

00:35.269 --> 00:38.406
They haven't done the LP Leap
since season 22,

00:38.439 --> 00:40.108
"Beauty versus Sexy."

00:43.277 --> 00:46.514
Kayla, don't step on the stem.
You'll flip the pad.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.417
You should know that.
You're a life coach.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.454
-They flipped the pad!
-TAG: They flipped the pad.

00:53.487 --> 00:55.323
(groans)
What a noob.

00:59.327 --> 01:01.962
Hector and Audrey Chang,
you have won

01:01.995 --> 01:04.398
-The Amazing Place!
-(cheering)

01:04.432 --> 01:06.700
-Called it.
-Mom, you always
call the winner.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.202
How do you know?

01:08.236 --> 01:10.871
Well, your father may have
Moe's and football,

01:10.904 --> 01:13.874
but I have being by myself
and this show.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.643
ANNOUNCER: Do you like
adventure, bandanas

01:15.676 --> 01:17.945
and having your friends
see you melt down on TV?

01:17.978 --> 01:23.083
We want you for season 48
of The Amazing Place.

01:23.117 --> 01:25.653
Why don't you guys try out
for that show?

01:25.686 --> 01:26.954
You would dominate.

01:26.987 --> 01:29.123
Oh, no, I couldn't.

01:29.157 --> 01:30.924
You know what they say:
you don't fail

01:30.958 --> 01:33.894
at 100% of the shots
you don't take.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.130
But you've watched
every episode of the show

01:36.164 --> 01:38.299
and listened
to the director commentaries.

01:38.332 --> 01:41.602
You even made us play
the terrible home game.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.337
(Marge groans)

01:43.371 --> 01:45.173
-Come on, Mom.
-Just try out.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.074
-Come on, try out.
-Come on.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.842
-(whispering): Come on, try out.
-Try out.
-(Homer snoring)

01:48.876 --> 01:50.311
-Try out.
-Try out, Mom.

01:50.344 --> 01:53.113
-Try out!
-Try out!

01:53.147 --> 01:55.115
-Come on, just do it, Mom!
-Come on!

01:55.149 --> 01:57.251
Just try out!

01:57.285 --> 01:58.752
-(hoarse): Come on.
-Mom.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.521
-Just try out.
-Why don't you try out?

02:00.554 --> 02:02.656
-Just try out.
-Come on, do it.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.859
I'm not trying out,
so just can it.

02:07.895 --> 02:10.431
(gasps) I said "can it"
to my own children.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.166
What have I become?

02:12.200 --> 02:13.867
Baby, you've got
to tell them sometime.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.169
Tell us what?

02:15.203 --> 02:16.604
We know all the family secrets.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.038
Like that Dad lost
our college funds

02:18.071 --> 02:21.041
investing in a chain
of chewing tobacco cafes.

02:21.074 --> 02:23.043
Dippin' Dens was a great idea.

02:23.076 --> 02:25.479
We just weren't prepared
for all the spitting.

02:25.513 --> 02:27.848
Well, I might as well
come clean.

02:29.883 --> 02:30.984
(sighs)

02:31.018 --> 02:33.521
The real tragedy
is now Chaw House owns

02:33.554 --> 02:37.057
the entire
casual chewing market.

02:39.092 --> 02:41.729
The truth is, we have tried out.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.497
Dozens of times.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.068
Why should you pick us
to be on The Amazing Place?

02:48.101 --> 02:51.372
Because we're best friends
who never bicker.

02:52.406 --> 02:55.008
We're constantly
at each other's throats.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.579
We're motorcycle bikers.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.180
That's our persona.

03:01.249 --> 03:03.484
We have no idea what you want.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.186
Just please pick us.

03:06.220 --> 03:07.321
Why are you still doing this?

03:07.355 --> 03:08.922
We were already on that show

03:08.956 --> 03:11.058
where we had to crawl
into a drainage ditch.

03:11.091 --> 03:13.361
That was just you,
and it wasn't a show.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.062
It was a police bodycam.

03:15.095 --> 03:17.064
That was a good show.

03:18.299 --> 03:21.869
After 46 rejections,
I can take a hint.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.904
They don't want us.

03:26.039 --> 03:30.010
You know, reality shows
love a sob story,

03:30.043 --> 03:33.547
and we've got a storage bin
full of tears.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.716
And I've got a sister
who will edit them together

03:35.749 --> 03:37.050
while I feed the dog
marshmallows

03:37.084 --> 03:38.586
and see what happens.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.454
*

03:50.564 --> 03:52.633
Ow! (grunting)

03:54.268 --> 03:56.069
Oh, we're not here
to make friends.

03:56.103 --> 03:59.072
Unless I meet some awesome guy
who-who wants to be my friend.

03:59.106 --> 04:01.942
Yeah, I met this really cool guy
at the boba place,

04:01.975 --> 04:04.945
but he said he was moving
to Hong Kong and, uh,

04:04.978 --> 04:06.547
he didn't know his number yet.

04:06.580 --> 04:10.050
Every reality show needs
that crazy, no-limits guy

04:10.083 --> 04:12.820
that just shatters
society's taboos, right?

04:12.853 --> 04:15.756
Well, break out
your pixelation machine,

04:15.789 --> 04:19.993
because I am
your bug-eating nude fatso.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.029
Oh, also, I'm not here
to make friends.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.000
Oh, my God, married kids?

04:27.034 --> 04:28.302
You're in the show.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.604
-Ew, no.
-We're here on behalf

04:30.638 --> 04:32.172
of some different weirdos.

04:32.205 --> 04:34.308
Our parents have tried out
for every season

04:34.342 --> 04:35.976
of The Amazing Place.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.411
My dad would even record my mom

04:37.445 --> 04:40.247
opening your letters
in case they got picked.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.149
Mm-hmm.

04:43.551 --> 04:44.685
(gasps)

04:44.718 --> 04:45.953
(sighing):
Oh.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.988
(moaning):
Oh.

04:48.021 --> 04:51.592
(sighs)

04:51.625 --> 04:54.127
So think what a magical
TV moment it would be

04:54.161 --> 04:56.930
for our mom to find out
she made it on the show.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.532
After losing all hope.

04:58.566 --> 05:01.168
When she didn't even know
she applied.

05:01.201 --> 05:04.104
The ultimate superfan
gets one last chance

05:04.137 --> 05:06.374
to make her dreams come true.

05:06.407 --> 05:09.009
I don't know,
it sounds a little manipulative.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.378
You're fired.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.946
I think we just found
our Boston Rob.

05:12.980 --> 05:16.016
Or your Springfield Clancy.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.851
Huh? Huh?

05:18.986 --> 05:21.989
(sighs)
Electric bill, past due,

05:22.022 --> 05:24.825
Website renewal
"DippinDens.com."

05:24.858 --> 05:26.026
What's this?

05:26.059 --> 05:29.563
"Congratulations,
Marge and Homer Simpson.

05:29.597 --> 05:31.565
You have been selected
to compete on..."

05:31.599 --> 05:33.033
The Amazing Place!

05:33.066 --> 05:35.869
(gasps)
Tag Tuckerbag?

05:35.903 --> 05:37.070
Tag Buggernut?

05:37.104 --> 05:39.039
This is it.
After years of rejection,

05:39.072 --> 05:41.575
you two will finally compete
for a million dollars

05:41.609 --> 05:43.577
on The Amazing Place.

05:43.611 --> 05:45.646
But we didn't even try out.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.815
I edited together
your old auditions.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.083
And I gave notes
which were ignored.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.652
(gasps, grunts)

05:51.685 --> 05:55.088
My crazy dream is coming true.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.825
After you sign
the amazing waivers.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.993
So many ways to die.

06:00.027 --> 06:04.097
Falling off rocks,
rocks falling on me.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.933
Toxoplasmosis?

06:05.966 --> 06:08.536
That's what ate
Handsome Tom's face.

06:08.569 --> 06:11.004
Just call me Handsome Homer.

06:11.038 --> 06:14.408
-Bye, Mom!
-Don't get toxoplasmosis!

06:16.777 --> 06:18.779
(both gasps)

06:18.812 --> 06:20.714
Welcome to The Amazing Place.

06:20.748 --> 06:23.250
You're about to embark
on a test of mental toughness,

06:23.283 --> 06:25.085
physical strength and interviews
where you have to pretend

06:25.118 --> 06:26.887
that you're in the middle
of a challenge

06:26.920 --> 06:28.756
when it's already over.

06:28.789 --> 06:32.693
But first, let's kick things off
with a romantic beachside luau

06:32.726 --> 06:34.895
at Lover's Lagoon.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.464
(oohing)

06:36.497 --> 06:38.265
Right after
your first challenge.

06:38.298 --> 06:40.367
We took one item
from every person's bag

06:40.400 --> 06:42.870
and hid it in another
contestant's luggage.

06:42.903 --> 06:46.974
Everyone, find their
Suitcase Stowaway now.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.643
It's the ultimate
Tarmac Unpack Attack.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.712
Okay, Suitcase Stowaway.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.747
They've done this
three times before.

06:53.781 --> 06:56.283
Here's the secret: dump and dig.

06:56.316 --> 06:58.285
I found my stowaway.

06:59.987 --> 07:03.090
Great. Go through my other bag.

07:08.496 --> 07:09.997
Okay, Homie, don't panic.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.566
The secret is to just take
your time, and...

07:12.600 --> 07:14.201
(conch blowing)

07:16.103 --> 07:18.772
I'm sorry, Homer and Marge,
you've been...

07:18.806 --> 07:21.174
-Don't say it.
-...shell-iminated.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.510
No, no. No, no, no.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.478
We can't be
the first couple kicked off.

07:24.512 --> 07:26.980
That's the ultimate humiliation.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.655
I never even put on a swimsuit.

07:34.688 --> 07:37.157
I never got to see the lagoon.

07:37.190 --> 07:40.494
I'm crying, and no one's
even filming me.

07:44.998 --> 07:47.100
We didn't even make it
off the tarmac.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.636
All because of my screwup.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.103
I guess we're going home.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.672
No, you're going there.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.041
MARGE and HOMER:
Huh?

07:54.074 --> 07:56.043
A hotel? But we lost.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.145
If we let you go home now,
fans would know

07:58.178 --> 08:00.814
you've been kicked off
before the season airs.

08:00.848 --> 08:03.851
So ejected contestants
must stay at this hotel

08:03.884 --> 08:06.219
until every episode
is finished taping.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.956
So we can't go home for a month?

08:08.989 --> 08:10.858
Six weeks, counting post.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.160
(crying):
I don't know what post is.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.729
Hey, save some of those tears
for the reunion show.

08:15.763 --> 08:19.633
You'll just put us in the back
row and won't ask any questions.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.735
We won't even get
to hug the winner.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.904
Yeah, but the runner-up's
always wandering around

08:23.937 --> 08:25.505
looking for someone to hug.

08:25.539 --> 08:26.807
That's your play.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.041
(birds screeching)

08:28.075 --> 08:30.678
How could I be such a noob?

08:30.711 --> 08:33.681
I could learn
to love a noob, given time.

08:33.714 --> 08:36.049
I already miss the kids.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.351
Well, there's got to be
a way we can call home

08:38.385 --> 08:40.153
without getting in trouble.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.155
If you say anything
that reveals or implies

08:42.189 --> 08:44.091
that you have been ejected
from The Amazing Place,

08:44.124 --> 08:46.560
you are subject to a fine
of up to a million dollars

08:46.594 --> 08:49.096
and, for residents of Georgia,
the death penalty.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.400
Kids, kids, how are you?

08:53.433 --> 08:55.102
Lisa said I can't use
the bubble bath,

08:55.135 --> 08:56.670
but you said you bought it
for everybody.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.005
Forget the bubble bath.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.072
How's the show?

08:59.106 --> 09:00.207
Are you winning?

09:00.240 --> 09:03.043
Um, I'm not supposed to say.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.077
That means you're dominating.

09:04.111 --> 09:05.713
-I knew it!
-(both grunt)

09:05.746 --> 09:06.947
No, no, we're not dominating.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.516
I didn't reveal or imply that.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.518
Well, you can't have gotten
kicked off yet.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.986
You just got there.

09:15.422 --> 09:16.957
Mmm...

09:16.990 --> 09:18.025
(clears throat)

09:18.058 --> 09:19.426
"Your mother and I are excited

09:19.459 --> 09:21.729
"to be part
of the Amazing Place family.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.964
"All further inquiries
should be submitted in writing

09:23.997 --> 09:26.934
to Don DiBusco Productions,
Burbank, California."

09:26.967 --> 09:28.736
What the hell
are you talking about?

09:28.769 --> 09:30.470
This conversation
is hereby terminated.

09:30.503 --> 09:33.106
You are each entitled
to one capful of bubble bath.

09:35.142 --> 09:38.712
Now, that's parenting.

09:38.746 --> 09:40.580
Come on, baby, it's not so bad.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.382
Really?

09:42.415 --> 09:47.955
Six weeks away from the kids,
Grampa, my sisters, your job.

09:47.988 --> 09:51.558
With nothing to do but eat
free room service

09:51.591 --> 09:55.062
and watch dopey movies on demand
while they keep us quiet

09:55.095 --> 09:57.731
with an endless supply
of free booze.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.232
It's a nightmare.

09:59.266 --> 10:02.970
It is. It truly is.

10:03.003 --> 10:05.806
* I was up late night ballin'

10:05.839 --> 10:08.075
* Countin' up hundreds
by the thousand *

10:08.108 --> 10:10.343
* I was up late night ballin'

10:10.377 --> 10:11.979
* Countin' up hundreds
by the thousand. *

10:12.012 --> 10:13.947
You see, Curtis,
you never really

10:13.981 --> 10:16.316
get an episode of SportsCenter

10:16.349 --> 10:18.952
until you've seen it
for the third time.

10:18.986 --> 10:21.088
Can I freshen up
that appetizer platter for you?

10:21.121 --> 10:24.124
Nah, I better go
check in on my wife.

10:24.157 --> 10:27.160
She's having a hard time
adjusting to hotel living.

10:30.230 --> 10:34.001
(grunting):
Just let me clean.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.970
(vacuum cleaner whirring)

10:38.071 --> 10:39.973
Sweetie, I'm worried about you.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.809
You just sit around
all day changing

10:41.842 --> 10:43.711
the combination
on the room safe.

10:43.744 --> 10:46.146
Do you want to put something
in the room safe?

10:46.179 --> 10:47.948
I don't deserve valuables.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.017
It's my fault we're stuck here.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.819
All I deserve is to sit alone

10:51.852 --> 10:54.955
and watch the TV channel
that's about the hotel.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.990
ANNOUNCER: Forgot your
toothbrush? No problem.

10:57.024 --> 11:00.961
Sundries gift shop has all the
toiletries every traveler needs.

11:00.994 --> 11:04.097
Sundries is awesome.
I got this shirt there.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.834
Look, I know you're miserable,

11:06.867 --> 11:09.803
but let me show you how great
this place can be.

11:09.837 --> 11:12.305
It's just a stupid chain hotel.

11:12.339 --> 11:16.476
Darling, take my hand, and
you'll see it's so much more.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.812
* Well, since you blew
the challenge *

11:18.846 --> 11:21.081
* And we're not allowed
to tell *

11:21.114 --> 11:24.084
* We're getting
all expenses paid at *

11:24.117 --> 11:26.419
* Airport Hotel

11:26.453 --> 11:28.989
* The pillow's so foamy, baby

11:29.022 --> 11:31.024
* Order food on the phone-y

11:31.058 --> 11:35.595
* We'll eat Toblerone-y,
so don't cry *

11:35.628 --> 11:38.165
* For breakfast
they have bagels *

11:38.198 --> 11:40.333
* Cream cheese but no lox

11:40.367 --> 11:45.205
* A mini pack of cereal,
make a bowl out of the box *

11:45.238 --> 11:47.574
* The pool's
so chlorine-y, baby *

11:47.607 --> 11:49.376
* The towel's so teeny

11:49.409 --> 11:53.781
* No lifeguard to be seen-y,
we could die *

11:53.814 --> 11:56.616
* No job, no kids, no Flanders

11:56.649 --> 11:58.718
* Choice of bar soap
or bath gel *

11:58.752 --> 12:00.253
* Small ketchup's friends

12:00.287 --> 12:01.955
* With tiny mustard

12:01.989 --> 12:04.057
* Airport Hotel

12:04.091 --> 12:07.961
* Now that I've shown you, baby,
they'll leave us alone *

12:07.995 --> 12:10.898
* Yeah, baby,
toilet's got a phone, yeah *

12:10.931 --> 12:12.732
* Don't know why.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.768
(both moaning)

12:16.136 --> 12:18.105
Might the lady enjoy a movie

12:18.138 --> 12:21.942
whose title doesn't appear
on the bill?

12:29.783 --> 12:32.786
Maybe being trapped here
isn't so bad.

12:32.820 --> 12:35.555
I'm not even worried
about what the kids are up to.

12:35.588 --> 12:39.893
-Come on, dig. Dig.
-We're hot.

12:39.927 --> 12:42.229
You can go for a nice, cool swim

12:42.262 --> 12:44.131
after you finish
digging my pool.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.900
I'm telling Patty and Selma
what you're doing.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.735
What? We want a pool.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.804
I just got my first wax
in years.

12:50.838 --> 12:53.373
Hurt so much they had to
give me an epidural.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.946
Haw-haw!

13:00.147 --> 13:03.116
The fitness center only had
an old NordicTrack,

13:03.150 --> 13:04.985
but it felt good to work out.

13:05.018 --> 13:07.988
I sat on a yoga ball
and drank cucumber water.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.257
It's nice to know
I can still do that.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.325
Mm, maybe we should peek in.

13:12.359 --> 13:15.595
I am kind of curious to see
what's going on in the show.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.597
Really? You sure
you can handle it?

13:17.630 --> 13:19.166
Oh, yeah.

13:19.199 --> 13:24.037
I'm still in a great mood after
reading that free USA Today.

13:24.071 --> 13:28.008
(gasps) Look, they're
editing our episode.

13:28.041 --> 13:30.978
There I am, looking
for that Suitcase Stowaway.

13:31.011 --> 13:33.380
I never found it, did I?

13:33.413 --> 13:36.149
Great. Go through my other bag.

13:36.183 --> 13:39.786
HOMER (chuckling): Hey, that's
me looking for that thing.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.455
Okay. Marge's vitamins,
Marge's pajamas,

13:42.489 --> 13:43.991
Marge's giant chocolate bar.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.860
I didn't pack
a giant chocolate bar.

13:49.062 --> 13:50.397
What Marge doesn't know

13:50.430 --> 13:53.800
is that her husband just ate
her Suitcase Stowaway.

13:53.833 --> 13:57.070
This ultimate "didgeri-don't"
will send them packing.

13:57.104 --> 13:58.071
EDITOR:
Whoa!

13:58.105 --> 14:01.674
I'm not the one who screwed up.
You are.

14:01.708 --> 14:03.176
I'm so sorry.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.511
I know you're gonna
need some space,

14:04.544 --> 14:06.046
so I'll sleep on the couch.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.250
-(Marge groans)
-(Homer moans sadly)

14:15.055 --> 14:17.057
*

14:32.705 --> 14:34.707
*

14:41.481 --> 14:43.416
(both groans)

14:46.153 --> 14:48.888
(groans) What a dump.

14:48.922 --> 14:50.623
What's that from?

14:50.657 --> 14:52.926
-What?
-"What a dump."

14:52.960 --> 14:54.361
How would I know?

14:54.394 --> 14:57.897
We wouldn't be in this dump
if you weren't such a flop.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.933
I'm tired, dear. It's late.

14:59.967 --> 15:01.969
A chocolate flop.

15:02.002 --> 15:04.371
Yes, a chocolate flop.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.539
That's what you keep braying
at everybody.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.108
I don't bray!

15:08.141 --> 15:10.210
All right, you don't bray.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.779
I do not bray!

15:12.812 --> 15:14.247
I said you didn't bray.

15:14.281 --> 15:15.548
Make me a drink.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.784
-Haven't you had enough?
-Make me a drink.

15:17.817 --> 15:20.753
Yes, dear.

15:20.787 --> 15:23.556
And lay out some mixed nuts.
We've got guests.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.759
-We've got what?
-Guests. Guests!

15:26.793 --> 15:28.328
You know, what's-their-names.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.596
I don't know their names.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.564
They just got eliminated
from the show.

15:31.598 --> 15:35.168
It took them five weeks,
not five minutes.

15:35.202 --> 15:36.936
(knocking on door)

15:36.970 --> 15:38.138
Go answer the door.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.607
All right, love,
whatever love wants.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.343
Get the door. The door!

15:43.376 --> 15:44.777
I'm getting the door.

15:44.811 --> 15:47.314
You don't have to bray
like some subhuman monster.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.016
Oh, go to hell!

15:50.817 --> 15:55.155
Hi! Hi, there. Come on in.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.757
-This is, um...
-Honey.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.826
And this is Nick.

15:59.859 --> 16:02.162
Oh, I thought his name
was what's-his-name.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.497
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

16:04.531 --> 16:06.699
Just ignore Homer, old sourpuss.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.001
That's me.

16:08.035 --> 16:10.970
Hey, sourpuss, why don't you
mix them a drink?

16:11.004 --> 16:12.472
Yes, dear.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.407
(Homer groans quietly)

16:15.708 --> 16:17.010
I love your room.

16:17.044 --> 16:19.012
We have the exact same
paintings.

16:22.915 --> 16:26.886
You were this close to winning
The Three-Legged Chase.

16:26.919 --> 16:31.624
You were right in there, Nick,
right at the meat of things.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.626
There's no limit to you,
is there?

16:33.660 --> 16:36.363
And how would you have played
the Three-Legged Chase?

16:36.396 --> 16:38.498
Why don't I show you?

16:38.531 --> 16:42.135
-Don't encourage her.
-Encourage me.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.171
(Marge grunting)

16:48.341 --> 16:51.211
Inside, outside,
inside, outside,

16:51.244 --> 16:55.215
in, out, in, out,
in, out, in, out.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.084
(both sigh)

16:57.117 --> 16:59.186
You can sit around
with the minibar gin

16:59.219 --> 17:00.820
running out of your mouth.

17:00.853 --> 17:04.091
You can tear me apart like
the box the shower cap came in.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.659
That's perfectly okay,
that's all right.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.361
You can stand it.

17:08.395 --> 17:10.097
I cannot stand it!

17:10.130 --> 17:11.864
You can stand it.

17:11.898 --> 17:14.033
You married me for it.

17:14.067 --> 17:17.337
-Our son is dead.
-No, he isn't.

17:17.370 --> 17:20.140
-We have no son!
-Yes, we do!

17:21.208 --> 17:22.709
Oh, yeah, Bart.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.111
(birds chirping)

17:24.144 --> 17:26.913
Man, last night sure was
a searing portrait

17:26.946 --> 17:28.715
of a marriage in turmoil.

17:28.748 --> 17:33.120
It's still in turmoil, you
chocolate-gobbling dream killer.

17:33.153 --> 17:37.190
Attention, everyone, gather
by the bowl of mini yogurts.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.559
For the first time ever
on The Amazing Place,

17:39.592 --> 17:42.129
two eliminated contestants
will be brought back

17:42.162 --> 17:43.863
to compete in the finale.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.064
(all gasp)

17:45.098 --> 17:47.134
But here's the catch,
to get back in,

17:47.167 --> 17:50.036
you have to dump your loved one
for another partner.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.105
So, if your spouse screwed up,

17:52.139 --> 17:54.040
this is your chance
to cut them loose.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.309
It's the Dead Weight Drop.

17:56.343 --> 17:58.111
(all grunting, murmuring)

17:58.145 --> 18:01.148
-I choose Nick.
-(all gasp)

18:01.181 --> 18:02.949
That's got to sting, Homer.

18:02.982 --> 18:04.984
I'm just glad
my friends and family

18:05.017 --> 18:08.121
are never going to see me
humiliated like this.

18:08.155 --> 18:10.690
(whimpering)

18:12.091 --> 18:14.427
This is it, the final challenge:

18:14.461 --> 18:16.763
Mango Tango.

18:16.796 --> 18:19.065
First, pick and peel
enough fresh mango

18:19.098 --> 18:21.168
to make six mango-ritas,

18:21.201 --> 18:24.137
which you must then carry
across a log bridge.

18:24.171 --> 18:28.107
But under the bridge is a pack
of mango-loving monkeys,

18:28.141 --> 18:29.609
which can only be soothed

18:29.642 --> 18:32.111
with music played
on a pennywhistle.

18:32.145 --> 18:34.781
Also, there will be
a Kia Sportage in the background

18:34.814 --> 18:37.116
that we couldn't figure out
how to fit into the challenge.

18:37.150 --> 18:40.253
Your Mango Tango starts now.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.955
And Marge draws first fruit.

18:44.023 --> 18:45.925
I'll make the mango-ritas.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.327
TAG:
Great teamwork.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.996
Could this be
a million-dollar puree?

18:50.029 --> 18:52.665
I'll handle those monkeys.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.869
(angry screeching)

18:56.903 --> 18:58.605
(playing melody on pennywhistle)

18:58.638 --> 19:01.808
TAG: It's the ultimate groovy
chill-out flute jam.

19:01.841 --> 19:04.611
Look, the monkeys are mellowing.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.914
This is our Kia Sportage Moment.

19:10.082 --> 19:11.618
I did it.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.953
We won. Without Homer.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.155
(laughs)

19:16.189 --> 19:17.490
Marge and Nick,

19:17.524 --> 19:20.827
I want to congratulate you
on winning The Amazing Place.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.995
-NICK: Yay!
-I want to, but I can't.

19:23.029 --> 19:25.131
(vacuum whirring)

19:25.164 --> 19:28.635
Because you failed to salt
the rims of your mango-ritas,

19:28.668 --> 19:32.138
rendering them mango-nothings.

19:32.171 --> 19:35.174
(gasps) I screwed up a recipe?

19:35.208 --> 19:38.578
So get out of the way of the
actual winners, Shawn and Barry.

19:38.611 --> 19:39.746
Hey!

19:39.779 --> 19:42.949
Our rims are super salty.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.553
-(Nick grunts)
-(monkeys screeching)

19:46.586 --> 19:48.588
NICK:
Hey! Hey, hey, come on. Oh!

19:49.556 --> 19:52.058
I am such a noob.

19:53.293 --> 19:56.195
I am such a noob.

19:56.229 --> 19:58.698
(groans) What a noob.

19:58.731 --> 20:01.100
-Total noob.
-Classic noob.

20:01.133 --> 20:05.037
Homie, I was such a jerk.
How can I make it up to you?

20:05.071 --> 20:07.507
Sweetheart, you already have.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.109
I am such a noob.

20:10.142 --> 20:11.444
(laughs)

20:11.478 --> 20:14.414
I've screwed up so many times
in our marriage,

20:14.447 --> 20:17.350
and people always feel
so sorry for you.

20:17.384 --> 20:21.220
But with this epic noob blunder,
I'm the one they pity.

20:21.254 --> 20:25.358
(shuddering):
Oh... pity. Oh...

20:25.392 --> 20:27.594
Is this how you feel
all the time?

20:27.627 --> 20:31.063
Uh, kind of. I just never
let myself enjoy it.

20:31.097 --> 20:34.567
Oh, pity feels good.

Ooh, I just heard about
a great new reality show.

20:49.849 --> 20:52.785
PBS is showing a performance
of an Edward Albee play.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.821
Sports talk it is.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.825
How can you say that Phoenix
has any chance

20:58.858 --> 21:00.493
to win the Western Conference?

21:00.527 --> 21:02.061
What are you talking about?

21:02.094 --> 21:04.597
We both picked the Phoenix Suns
to win it all.
