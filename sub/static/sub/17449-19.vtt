00:00.625 --> 00:02.500
(man) Previously on Mighty Med .

00:02.583 --> 00:04.291
You have to hear
this dream I had last night.

00:04.375 --> 00:06.375
I was onboard an alien spaceship

00:06.458 --> 00:08.417
that was carrying
something called the Arcturion.

00:08.500 --> 00:11.333
Why don't you
just make that into a comic book?

00:11.417 --> 00:13.291
I'll even give you a writing credit.

00:13.375 --> 00:16.250
You could use a fake name,
like Quimby Fletcher.

00:16.333 --> 00:19.875
-Bring me Quimby Fletcher.
-The Arcturion is real?

00:19.959 --> 00:22.125
My boss won't stop
until he gets his hands on it

00:22.208 --> 00:24.500
and becomes
the most powerful man on Earth.

00:24.583 --> 00:27.333
Boss, this is unit 2-3-8.

00:27.417 --> 00:29.542
Captain Atomic is no longer a threat.

00:29.625 --> 00:32.959
I've downloaded your final instructions
onto my memory drive.

00:42.458 --> 00:45.291
Thanks, Flashback,
for showing those clips to Skylar.

00:46.166 --> 00:48.417
So who are the henchmen working for?

00:48.500 --> 00:50.417
Some heartless
villain like Slaughtermaster,

00:50.500 --> 00:51.792
or one of the airlines?

00:53.709 --> 00:55.542
Okay, it's bad enough I can't fly anymore,

00:55.625 --> 00:57.500
but 25 bucks to check luggage?

00:57.583 --> 00:59.166
That's beyond evil.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.125
I don't know who they're working for.

01:02.208 --> 01:04.083
And why do you have to check luggage?

01:04.166 --> 01:05.834
You only have one outfit.

01:07.875 --> 01:11.083
Look, I'm safe for now, but we have
to figure out who these villains are

01:11.166 --> 01:13.000
before they figure out
I'm Quimby Fletcher.

01:13.083 --> 01:14.250
Now think, Kaz.

01:14.333 --> 01:15.709
Is there anything you remember?

01:16.625 --> 01:18.750
Okay, I did notice one thing.

01:18.834 --> 01:23.083
They had matching tattoos
of an infinity sign on their wrists.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.625
Principal Howard has an infinity tattoo.

01:25.709 --> 01:27.667
I remember seeing it and thinking,

01:27.750 --> 01:30.083
"Hey, Principal Howard
has an infinity tattoo."

01:30.875 --> 01:32.792
That's a great story, Oliver.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.834
Lots of twists in it.

01:36.291 --> 01:39.542
My point is,
maybe they're all working together.

01:39.625 --> 01:42.291
Principal Howard is down in Mighty Max.

01:42.375 --> 01:44.333
You guys sneak him
out and interrogate him.

01:44.417 --> 01:46.458
I'll meet up with you later.

01:46.542 --> 01:47.667
Why? Where are you going?

01:48.375 --> 01:49.875
I have a tuxedo fitting.

01:49.959 --> 01:52.208
My mom wants everything
to be perfect for her big day,

01:52.291 --> 01:55.417
so tomorrow,
I have a teeth and eyeball whitening.

01:56.625 --> 01:58.834
She really wants the photos to pop.

02:01.375 --> 02:03.834
I guess you'll have to fill in for Oliver.

02:03.917 --> 02:05.667
Okay. What does that involve?

02:14.917 --> 02:17.750
Oh, okay, Flashback,
I think she gets the idea.

02:19.625 --> 02:20.917

03:17.875 --> 03:21.250
Oh! It's about time!

03:21.333 --> 03:23.625
It reeked of corned beef in there.

03:24.375 --> 03:25.959
What are you complaining for?

03:26.041 --> 03:28.458
They were keeping you in a birdcage.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.417
Principal Howard, Kaz was captured

03:31.500 --> 03:33.291
by two villains looking for

03:33.375 --> 03:35.500
an intergalactic power source
called the Arcturion.

03:35.583 --> 03:38.458
They had the same tattoo as you.

03:38.542 --> 03:41.917
I don't know what you're talking about.
You see any tattoos on my body?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.291
Oh, wait.

03:43.375 --> 03:45.542
Thanks to you, I don't have a body.

03:47.125 --> 03:50.166
Okay, you wanna play it that way? Fine.

03:50.250 --> 03:51.667
If you don't talk,

03:51.750 --> 03:54.125
I'll put you in the cell
of certain destruction,

03:54.208 --> 03:56.500
where you'll be turned
into an action figure.

03:56.583 --> 04:00.291
Yeah. Then, I'll attach your tiny head

04:00.375 --> 04:03.917
to this broken doll. Then...

04:04.000 --> 04:07.834
I'll make you ride around
in this pink toy convertible.

04:09.542 --> 04:11.959
Then make you drive

04:12.041 --> 04:13.375
to the make-believe mall.

04:13.458 --> 04:15.542
Okay, okay. Stop. I'll talk.

04:17.083 --> 04:18.625
Before you do,

04:19.458 --> 04:21.208
why do you have all that?

04:22.542 --> 04:23.750
It's just weird.

04:25.417 --> 04:27.208
We're supposed to be interrogating him.

04:28.083 --> 04:29.166
Now...

04:30.458 --> 04:31.750
who do you work for?

04:33.500 --> 04:34.917
Okay, I'll talk!

04:37.125 --> 04:38.583
We all work for Mr. Terror,

04:38.667 --> 04:42.417
a ruthless criminal genius so secret,
no one's ever seen his face.

04:42.500 --> 04:45.792
Maybe he's horribly disfigured.

04:45.875 --> 04:47.834
Or worse, has a lizard face.

04:49.792 --> 04:53.875
Oh. Sorry, Lizard Man.
I didn't know you were working today.

04:57.959 --> 04:59.375
Now...

04:59.458 --> 05:00.792
where's the Arcturion?

05:01.542 --> 05:03.375
I can't remember.

05:03.458 --> 05:06.125
Before I could report back to Mr. Terror,

05:06.208 --> 05:09.125
I transferred all the information
I gathered about the Arcturion

05:09.208 --> 05:10.917
onto a memory drive, and it's missing.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.333
Oliver took the memory drive
out at school.

05:13.417 --> 05:15.709
-Let's go get it.
-You're outta luck.

05:15.792 --> 05:18.250
The memory drive is designed to explode

05:18.333 --> 05:20.959
if it remains uninstalled for 72 hours,

05:21.041 --> 05:23.792
which is in two hours and eleven minutes.

05:23.875 --> 05:25.166
Come on, let's get to school.

05:25.250 --> 05:26.709
Wait. I have one more question.

05:27.333 --> 05:29.500
Seriously, why do you have all that stuff?

05:34.417 --> 05:36.500
(text alert chimes)

05:39.709 --> 05:41.792
Okay, I'm good to go.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.875
Tuxedo is perfect.

05:43.959 --> 05:47.709
If by perfect you mean poorly designed
and badly sewn.

05:48.417 --> 05:49.542
No offense.

05:49.625 --> 05:52.333
I know you're doing the best
you can with what you've got,

05:52.417 --> 05:56.000
which is no skills and a poorly run shop.

05:57.834 --> 05:59.083
I agree.

05:59.166 --> 06:01.458
And his licorice is stale.

06:04.291 --> 06:05.917
That's a tape measure.

06:09.750 --> 06:12.083
And let's get Horace's opinion on the tux.

06:12.166 --> 06:14.333
Maybe I should talk to him privately,

06:14.417 --> 06:17.458
man to man,
because this is mighty important.

06:18.208 --> 06:20.542
Oliver, we're gonna be family soon.

06:20.625 --> 06:23.542
Anything you have to say,
you can say in front of all of us.

06:23.625 --> 06:24.834
I'll show you.

06:24.917 --> 06:27.834
Sometimes I like to drink milk
out of a baby bottle.

06:29.417 --> 06:30.375
See?

06:33.208 --> 06:35.542
Look, Mom, I really think I can go,

06:35.625 --> 06:37.542
because this tuxedo is the one.

06:37.625 --> 06:38.709
Yes.

06:38.792 --> 06:41.750
If we decide to wear tuxedoes.

06:41.834 --> 06:45.125
We're also considering a theme wedding.

06:47.166 --> 06:49.333
A theme wedding? What theme?

06:49.417 --> 06:50.458
We haven't decided.

06:50.542 --> 06:52.250
We have 50 outfits to try on.

06:54.250 --> 06:55.291
Excuse me.

06:55.375 --> 06:58.333
Do you have a dinosaur costume
in a men's regular?

07:08.792 --> 07:10.250
Hey, Jordan.

07:10.333 --> 07:12.917
What's everyone
doing here during vacation?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.834
It's the school art fair.
You guys wanna see my latest painting?

07:15.917 --> 07:17.208
It's called...

07:18.125 --> 07:18.959
"Agony."

07:20.709 --> 07:23.000
Agony? I don't get it.

07:23.083 --> 07:24.917
That's because it's not done.

07:28.792 --> 07:31.041
There. Now it's done.

07:36.834 --> 07:39.041
Jordan's earring is the memory drive.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.291
She must've picked it up
in the hallway after the fight.

07:42.375 --> 07:45.875
-We gotta get it from her somehow.
-Okay, don't worry. I have a plan.

07:45.959 --> 07:47.917
Hey, Jordan.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.834
I love your earring.

07:49.917 --> 07:52.333
It makes you look so sweet and feminine.

07:52.417 --> 07:53.917
It does? Ugh!

07:54.000 --> 07:55.208
Take it.

08:00.750 --> 08:03.792
Hey, Jordan,
why is she wearing the same earring?

08:03.875 --> 08:05.542
Oh, Gus thought it was cool,

08:05.625 --> 08:07.959
so he made replicas
of it and is selling them.

08:08.041 --> 08:11.000
Why Gus needs more money, I have no idea.

08:15.875 --> 08:19.959
Hey, Gus,
the earring that Jordan was wearing,

08:20.041 --> 08:21.834
-is that the original?
-I don't know.

08:21.917 --> 08:23.709
I gave the original to my manufacturer,

08:23.792 --> 08:26.000
and when he gave them back,
they were all mixed up

08:26.083 --> 08:27.792
like a salad, and my grandma,

08:27.875 --> 08:29.667
who thinks she's a salad.

08:30.417 --> 08:31.959
How many did you make?

08:32.041 --> 08:33.875
Only like four or five...

08:34.792 --> 08:35.834
...hundred.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.125
This is insane.

09:05.458 --> 09:07.959
Mom, why would you
even want a theme wedding?

09:08.041 --> 09:10.291
That doesn't sound like you at all.

09:10.375 --> 09:11.834
Actually, it was my idea.

09:11.917 --> 09:13.375
I love playing dress-up,

09:13.458 --> 09:15.750
almost as much as I love milk.

09:20.792 --> 09:22.083
(text alert chimes)

09:26.417 --> 09:29.000
Uh, well, I have to get going,

09:29.083 --> 09:32.750
so continue without me, and I'm sure
whatever outfits you pick out...

09:36.000 --> 09:37.875
What? Who locked the door?

09:37.959 --> 09:39.000
I did.

09:39.083 --> 09:42.792
Look, Oliver, you're clearly upset
about our family dynamic.

09:42.875 --> 09:46.125
So I think we should have
a family feelings session,

09:46.208 --> 09:49.083
because there's nothing
more important than family.

09:49.166 --> 09:50.667
Right, Mom?

09:50.750 --> 09:54.792
Oh, that's so sweet
that you called me Mom.

09:54.875 --> 09:56.041
Don't do it again.

09:58.291 --> 10:02.417
Hey, I have to deal with a superhero
emergency. You can't lock me in.

10:02.500 --> 10:03.875
You're not going anywhere.

10:03.959 --> 10:06.083
I'm sick of being unappreciated,

10:06.166 --> 10:08.375
so I will not rest
until the favorite in this family

10:08.458 --> 10:09.875
is me, me!

10:13.000 --> 10:16.709
Alan, I think a family
meeting is a wonderful idea,

10:16.792 --> 10:18.500
because Bridget told me to say so.

10:20.834 --> 10:23.959
Oliver, why can't you be more like Alan?

10:24.041 --> 10:26.959
Mature, enlightened, bright.

10:27.041 --> 10:28.834
What are you talking about?

10:28.917 --> 10:31.208
He's about to eat a pin cushion.

10:32.583 --> 10:33.709
I am?

10:33.792 --> 10:36.041
I thought it was
a very dry and prickly tomato.

10:37.959 --> 10:41.458
Well, at least he eats
what he thinks are vegetables.

10:49.583 --> 10:52.917
We need to figure out a way to get all
these drives before the real one explodes.

10:53.625 --> 10:56.625
I wish Oliver was here.
Thinking makes my head hurt.

10:57.792 --> 10:59.291
I'll just think the way Oliver does.

11:00.083 --> 11:01.166
Oh, I've got it.

11:01.250 --> 11:03.750
Remember the issue of the Crusher
where he does the thing

11:03.834 --> 11:07.125
with the thing,
and gets the thing out of the thing?

11:08.375 --> 11:10.583
You're just speaking gibberish.

11:11.291 --> 11:12.834
Isn't that what Oliver does?

11:12.917 --> 11:14.166
I really don't listen.

11:15.792 --> 11:18.500
Ah. Ow, ow, okay,
I just thought of something.

11:20.458 --> 11:23.583
Okay, but first, we have to get
the enlarging ray from Mighty Med.

11:24.542 --> 11:28.041
Connie, why is your ear so huge?

11:31.917 --> 11:35.667
Gus, I put on your cheap earring,

11:35.750 --> 11:37.625
and it must be defective.

11:37.709 --> 11:39.625
It made my ear swell up.

11:39.709 --> 11:42.875
Yeah, and that's not the only side effect.

11:42.959 --> 11:45.959
It also makes her
run repeatedly into walls.

12:03.250 --> 12:04.500
There must be a mistake.

12:04.583 --> 12:06.166
Give me a minute to think.

12:12.500 --> 12:14.959
You all better get rid of those earrings.

12:15.041 --> 12:17.375
They're defective
and have terrible side effects.

12:17.458 --> 12:20.166
Yeah, and you better get rid
of all your money, too.

12:20.250 --> 12:23.500
You touched your earring, then your money.
Who knows what got all over it?

12:28.291 --> 12:31.375
Okay, that's all over. Now can
you please shrink my ear back down?

12:31.458 --> 12:32.417
Oh, yeah.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.291
Just have to reverse the settings.

12:41.500 --> 12:44.417
Oh, no.
I made it way too small.

12:45.542 --> 12:47.625
No, that's the normal size of my ears.

12:47.709 --> 12:50.166
Really? Ew.

12:51.875 --> 12:55.000
Okay, now, we need to get the
memory drives back to Mighty Med

12:55.083 --> 12:58.083
and figure out which one
is Principal Robot Head's.

13:08.250 --> 13:10.250
This is bad. What do we do?

13:10.333 --> 13:13.875
Uh, scare them away
with your freakishly small ears?

13:25.375 --> 13:26.291
Don't worry.

13:26.375 --> 13:28.375
They can't attack us
with these witnesses around.

13:28.458 --> 13:32.083
Attention. My associate
and I run a television company,

13:32.166 --> 13:34.667
and we're holding auditions
in the civic center right now

13:34.750 --> 13:36.917
for our new reality show,

13:37.000 --> 13:39.417
Who Wants To Be
Famous For No Reason Whatsoever?

13:43.291 --> 13:45.834
The sad thing is, I would watch that.

13:46.792 --> 13:49.041
-You again.
-Ah!

13:50.166 --> 13:53.250
Your Principal Howard
never reported to the big boss.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.000
Now we know why. You got his memory drive.

13:56.083 --> 13:58.542
You're not getting the memory drive.

13:58.625 --> 14:00.333
(growls)

14:39.709 --> 14:41.875
-Kaz!
-Oh, sorry.

15:13.291 --> 15:14.709
You did it.

15:14.792 --> 15:16.500
That was fantastic.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.709
Ow!

15:25.834 --> 15:28.375
Remember, this is an open forum.

15:28.458 --> 15:31.667
The most important thing
is for us to be completely honest.

15:31.750 --> 15:33.458
Right, Dad?

15:33.542 --> 15:34.750
Right, son.

15:37.250 --> 15:38.583
And since we're being honest,

15:38.667 --> 15:41.291
Bridget, sometimes, when I'm kissing you,

15:41.375 --> 15:43.583
I'm thinking of a bridge.

15:44.625 --> 15:46.750
And sometimes, when I'm kissing you,

15:46.834 --> 15:48.542
I'm thinking about money.

15:55.792 --> 15:56.667
(text alert chimes)

16:01.792 --> 16:06.375
Uh, look, as fun and not weird as this is,

16:06.458 --> 16:08.417
I really have to go.

16:11.333 --> 16:13.458
Mom, make Alan unlock the door right now.

16:14.083 --> 16:16.667
Oliver,
don't talk to your mother like that.

16:16.750 --> 16:18.667
(British accent) Talk to her like this.

16:18.750 --> 16:20.166
She loves it.

16:20.250 --> 16:21.542
Don't you, guv'nor?

16:22.250 --> 16:25.583
Actually, as long as we're being honest,
I don't love it.

16:25.667 --> 16:28.500
When you talk like that,
it makes me want to pull off my ears

16:28.583 --> 16:30.083
and stuff them in your mouth.

16:32.375 --> 16:35.750
Oliver, your jealousy
of me is tearing this family apart.

16:35.834 --> 16:37.375
I think the only way for us

16:37.458 --> 16:39.959
to move forward
is for you to give me a hug

16:40.041 --> 16:41.166
and a kiss and say,

16:41.250 --> 16:44.083
"Alan, even though
you're great in every way,

16:44.166 --> 16:45.959
and I am, at best, below average,

16:46.542 --> 16:48.000
I love you."

16:56.291 --> 17:01.166
Alan, even though
you are great in every way,

17:01.959 --> 17:04.208
and I am, at best, below average...

17:07.208 --> 17:08.291
I love you.

17:13.959 --> 17:15.959
See? How hard was that?

17:20.583 --> 17:24.458
(British accent) Looks like we is one big,
happy family, we is.

17:24.542 --> 17:26.750
I'm serious. Stop it.

17:33.583 --> 17:35.333
One of these memory drives is yours.

17:35.417 --> 17:38.333
We have to plug each into your head
to figure out which is the real one.

17:38.417 --> 17:40.458
Wait. Someone's coming.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.083
Sorry I'm late.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.041
I was a court jester,
and I had to kiss Alan.

17:51.417 --> 17:54.083
Okay, normally,
I'd have follow-up questions,

17:54.166 --> 17:56.583
but we're about to explode
in two minutes, so let's go.

18:02.458 --> 18:04.000
Cat video.

18:14.792 --> 18:16.875
(all shrieking)

18:17.750 --> 18:19.333
Old men in bathing suits.

18:22.709 --> 18:24.709
Fifteen seconds left.

18:24.792 --> 18:26.667
We have time for one more drive.
Oliver, you pick.

18:26.750 --> 18:29.792
No, you pick. If we blow up,
I want to be kissing Skylar.

18:29.875 --> 18:31.417
I can't let my last kiss be Alan.

18:32.959 --> 18:33.959
I'll pick.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.834
Five, four, three,

18:37.917 --> 18:39.709
two, one.

18:40.875 --> 18:42.166
(beeping)

18:42.250 --> 18:44.375
Huh. Thank goodness.

18:44.458 --> 18:46.375
We're all fine.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.625
Yeah. I've never been better.

18:48.709 --> 18:50.083
I'm a disembodied head

18:50.166 --> 18:52.166
imprisoned
in a corned beef carving station.

18:57.542 --> 18:58.458
Hey.

18:59.375 --> 19:01.250
That's the spaceship in my dream.

19:01.333 --> 19:03.000
It's buried underneath the school.

19:03.083 --> 19:05.500
And look. The Arcturion is inside it.

19:06.166 --> 19:08.750
Maybe when you fell
into the construction site,

19:08.834 --> 19:10.709
you touched something
that had been in contact

19:10.792 --> 19:13.083
with the Arcturion,
and that's why you had the dream.

19:13.166 --> 19:16.375
That's why there's so much
villain activity at this school.

19:16.458 --> 19:18.208
Villains are drawn
to the Arcturion's power

19:18.291 --> 19:20.625
without even knowing why,
like moths to the light.

19:20.709 --> 19:22.625
Actually, moths are drawn to light

19:22.709 --> 19:25.333
because of innate behavior
called transverse orientation.

19:25.417 --> 19:27.583
I did not miss you today.

19:29.875 --> 19:32.291
Look, it's an order from Mr. Terror.

19:39.166 --> 19:40.709
"To all operatives.

19:40.792 --> 19:43.458
Find Quimby Fletcher, remove his skin,

19:43.542 --> 19:46.041
and roast him over an open flame."

19:47.375 --> 19:50.333
You might be reading my recipe
for garlic herb rotisserie chicken.

19:52.542 --> 19:54.667
Oh. No, you're not.

19:54.750 --> 19:57.667
They're gonna slow cook you
until your meat falls off your bones.

20:04.458 --> 20:07.166
Mr. Terror, please,
just give us one more chance.

20:07.250 --> 20:11.000
Talk is cheap, and so are lackeys.

20:13.583 --> 20:15.500
(cell phone chiming)

20:17.834 --> 20:20.208
Lucky for you two, I have to take this.

20:20.291 --> 20:22.625
Get out of my sight, and don't come back

20:22.709 --> 20:24.208
until you locate Quimby Fletcher.

20:24.291 --> 20:27.166
Find out what he knows
and then destroy him.

20:39.792 --> 20:41.166
Hello, Oliver dear.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.041
Yes, you can go for pizza.

20:45.125 --> 20:47.125
I don't care if you're walking.

20:47.208 --> 20:48.542
You still need to wear a helmet.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.625
Oh, I know.
You think I'm being overprotective.

20:53.709 --> 20:55.583
But you don't realize that the world

20:55.667 --> 20:58.375
is a very dangerous place.

21:03.083 --> 21:05.667
(theme music plays)

21:27.125 --> 21:28.500
(boing)

21:32.166 --> 21:33.166
(boy) Yes!
