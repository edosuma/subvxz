00:43.660 --> 00:47.255
Cassidy, will you stop playing, please?

00:49.460 --> 00:53.135
You've touched it for a year
and you can not get better.

00:53.220 --> 00:56.849
Sorry folks.
I'll play softer now.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.660
Let me know if you mind, okay?

01:28.180 --> 01:30.455
Parker, Inspector.

01:31.340 --> 01:33.570
Parker, Mr. Governor.

01:52.860 --> 01:56.819
Robert Leroy Parker
vulgar Butch Cassidy.

01:58.620 --> 02:02.932
"How did you get the name Butch?"
- I worked at a butcher shop.

02:03.140 --> 02:06.689
- You want parole?
"Yes, yes, sir."

02:06.940 --> 02:11.331
The only time he was arrested.
For stealing horses.

02:11.980 --> 02:17.008
Despite being suspected of 3 round robberies

02:17.100 --> 02:20.297
- Wait...
- Six?
- 12 is more fitting.

02:20.540 --> 02:25.295
- Sheriff Bledsoe. You already know each other.
- Yes sir. It was he who arrested me.

02:25.380 --> 02:27.610
- Hello, Ray.
- Hello, Butch.

02:29.740 --> 02:32.971
"Were not you working in Utah?"
- I still am.

02:33.260 --> 02:37.094
The sheriff came here to speak well of
you when he heard about the conditional.

02:37.180 --> 02:41.298
He said he released you from
jail for a few hours...

02:41.540 --> 02:44.657
... on the eve of sending you here.
That's right?

02:44.780 --> 02:46.372
Yes sir.

02:46.620 --> 02:50.533
"He was not afraid that he
take advantage to escape?
- No?
"Why not?"

02:50.780 --> 02:53.214
Because I promised I would not run away.

02:54.740 --> 03:00.417
Promise me you'll stay on the side of the
law, and I'll give you the parole now.

03:05.700 --> 03:08.612
"I do not think I can do that, sir."
"Why not?"

03:08.860 --> 03:14.571
Why it would not be true. Ray, you know I
tried to walk the line, but I could not.

03:14.660 --> 03:19.131
"If you want to be loose you need to cooperate."
- I, I know, I know, but...

03:19.132 --> 03:25.019
But it would be a lie, sir, sir.

03:25.020 --> 03:27.773
I'll tell you what I can do.

03:28.260 --> 03:31.730
- I make a deal.
"Butch, he's the Governor.

03:31.940 --> 03:35.979
I promise, that if I ever let
go of the law in this state.

03:36.180 --> 03:39.138
That's what you want, is not it?
IT IS...

03:39.340 --> 03:41.251
I swear I forget the state!

03:41.460 --> 03:45.738
Even if a train with money passes
through Wyoming, I do not abide by it.

03:45.820 --> 03:47.811
Would I bump into it, Ray?

03:52.900 --> 03:55.733
- I tend to believe him.
- You see?

03:56.020 --> 03:58.136
- I...
= Word of Honor

03:58.820 --> 04:01.698
- I mean...
- Come on.

04:47.060 --> 04:48.652
Ahh, my God!

04:51.700 --> 04:55.136
Boy, there's an ice!

05:41.620 --> 05:44.088
- HÃº, how much is this?
- $ 25.

05:46.460 --> 05:49.896
I'll take this one.
And a handful of bullets.

05:51.700 --> 05:53.975
No, I'll take about a dozen.

06:03.460 --> 06:05.132
Liked it.

06:19.940 --> 06:22.454
- Hi.
- Hi how are you?

06:22.980 --> 06:25.255
- How about a photo?
- That's what I want.

06:25.460 --> 06:28.930
Great. I have good things.
I have the best collection you've ever seen.

06:32.620 --> 06:38.058
Can believe.
That's exciting.

06:38.660 --> 06:40.571
Come on, look at this.

06:41.620 --> 06:43.656
On here. Will impress you

06:44.620 --> 06:47.259
- Yeah, that one.
"That will be three dollars.

06:47.580 --> 06:50.811
- I only have two.
"No, three. That's the price.

06:51.060 --> 06:53.415
"I only have two," I said.
- Three.

06:55.420 --> 07:00.574
"I said two bucks for hell.
"Good for you, it costs two dollars."

07:03.660 --> 07:05.252
Stay still.

07:18.100 --> 07:20.534
Come on, I want to show you something.

07:20.740 --> 07:23.049
Good evening.
Good evening.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.693
I want a Guinness.

07:30.300 --> 07:33.497
- I was asking myself,
What's up there?
- Bedrooms.

07:34.780 --> 07:40.412
If you want to show your curiosity,
give her $ 20. She shows you one.

07:43.660 --> 07:45.935
I'm not that curious.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.329
Now it's up to you. What do you say?

08:11.020 --> 08:15.252
I have a revolver under the table.
Do not do anything stupid.

08:16.860 --> 08:20.614
Let's pretend we're
just playing cards.

08:24.020 --> 08:25.817
Right. What am I going to do...

08:26.060 --> 08:31.976
It's for a hundred dollars at the table.
You will see me and put another hundred dollars.

08:32.539 --> 08:38.979
Let's continue playing until
all money is on the table
It's ok?

08:40.460 --> 08:43.371
Right. Come on.

08:47.300 --> 08:50.895
$ 100... and I'm going
to put another $ 100.

08:52.820 --> 08:55.334
I think I'm going for another $
5oo, and we're done with it.

08:57.580 --> 09:02.449
"I think you're bluffing."
- Let's see if I am.

09:06.060 --> 09:11.498
I have a pair of three, and five
bullets pointed at your belly.

10:01.740 --> 10:04.049
Tone! Damn it!

10:07.540 --> 10:11.419
- Hey! This weapon is new!
- Great, then it should work!

10:27.740 --> 10:29.935
Get the sheriff!

11:02.660 --> 11:06.369
- Something wrong, sir. Le Fors?
"He did not cross here."

11:06.620 --> 11:11.694
"Are not the traces of him you were following?"
"Yes, they did, but he did not cross here.

11:12.060 --> 11:14.449
No traces on the other side

11:17.140 --> 11:19.290
He passed this channel

11:19.620 --> 11:21.099
How do you know that?

11:22.260 --> 11:27.095
See these shiny stones?
His horse kicked them.
There is mud on top of the others.

11:47.780 --> 11:50.214
- He's up there.
- Why do you think that?

11:50.300 --> 11:56.091
It took him a whole night
and a ride to get here.

11:56.380 --> 11:59.816
"And such a place gives a great position."
- Against us.

12:01.580 --> 12:05.334
We are in greater numbers.
We can lose some men.

12:06.860 --> 12:09.090
Let's get him!

12:13.260 --> 12:17.219
He did not do something so bad
that we need to arrest him

12:17.540 --> 12:19.849
Are you afraid to climb?

12:20.140 --> 12:25.168
He did some damage to my Saloon but
many of them open it from time to time

12:31.620 --> 12:36.899
I tracked it down to 10 days and now I got it.

12:37.300 --> 12:41.737
"But I can not go up and get him by myself."
"No, that would be suicide.

12:42.260 --> 12:44.615
- Depend on us.
- We?

12:48.260 --> 12:50.694
Anyone want this?

12:54.100 --> 12:56.330
Let's go.

13:01.100 --> 13:07.016
It seems they do not want you as much as I do!
But I'll see you again!

13:08.660 --> 13:10.776
Try to remember my face.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.371
The name is Le Fors!

13:40.380 --> 13:44.896
Hey! Listen if you're there. I'm the
guy you stole the gun from yesterday!

13:46.060 --> 13:48.972
I had to buy another one.
That cost me $ 12.

13:50.780 --> 13:53.135
I want to talk to you!

13:57.700 --> 13:59.736
Listen.

14:00.020 --> 14:03.490
I'll get this new gun...

14:04.180 --> 14:06.853
and put here on this stone.

14:10.660 --> 14:12.457
Did you see?

14:16.780 --> 14:22.412
- I'm here because I want to do you a favor!
- I'm making you one now.

14:24.420 --> 14:27.492
- As?
- Not by squeezing the trigger.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.692
Right. I think you will not, fordi...

14:32.860 --> 14:35.215
You have no reason to fear me!

14:36.940 --> 14:39.135
You also noticed that.

14:40.500 --> 14:44.891
I am also outlaw.
That's why I followed you.

14:45.300 --> 14:50.658
But I suck at tracking
so I followed the group.

14:51.860 --> 14:55.978
And here I am. You have to
admit it's very clever.

14:56.220 --> 14:58.840
Or very stupid.
- What the hell!

15:00.700 --> 15:04.613
If you kill me you will not listen to me.

15:09.860 --> 15:12.932
I bet this gets better hot.

15:19.340 --> 15:21.570
Mit navn er Butch Cassidy.

15:22.540 --> 15:24.895
You must have heard of me.

15:26.300 --> 15:29.610
- Maybe not. Do you have a name?
Yes.

15:33.460 --> 15:37.578
"Boy, you shoot well.
"Is that the favor you said?"

15:38.220 --> 15:40.370
I'll get there.

15:40.740 --> 15:45.655
The way you escaped yesterday
was something very special.

15:45.780 --> 15:50.012
But I would not be there
if I was not so dumb

15:52.020 --> 15:54.295
You need to admire my sincerity.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.895
I do not have to do anything.

15:57.140 --> 16:01.338
Trying to steal a game in a
crowded casino is stupid.

16:03.220 --> 16:07.054
Okay, all right. Maybe not stupid.
Maybe it's the wrong word.

16:07.260 --> 16:09.933
But who can handle a
revolver like this...

16:10.140 --> 16:14.577
I should not be sitting here eating
cold cereal in the middle of nowhere.

16:14.820 --> 16:18.096
Here's the favor I'm going to do to you:

16:18.380 --> 16:21.258
I'm going to teach him to steal a casino...

16:21.500 --> 16:26.813
"You're good at what you do, and so am I.
"What are you good at?"

16:28.020 --> 16:31.137
In thinking .. Plan.

16:31.860 --> 16:34.135
Stuff like that.

16:34.380 --> 16:38.578
I'm as good with my mind
as you are with the gun.

16:39.380 --> 16:42.292
- I work alone.
"I saw that you're very successful at it.

16:44.740 --> 16:47.254
Let me tell you something.

16:47.820 --> 16:50.129
I could kill him here.

16:50.380 --> 16:52.848
So do not say I'm stupid.

16:53.740 --> 16:58.291
I'm as smart as you, understand?

17:01.260 --> 17:03.820
With that in your hand, you're a genius.

17:08.020 --> 17:10.295
How do I get out of here?

17:34.580 --> 17:37.652
- Hello, Butch.
- Good morning, Harvey.

17:37.900 --> 17:41.336
- I was looking for you.
- IT IS?
- The train passed some
weeks full of money

17:41.580 --> 17:44.652
I did not find you
to help me steal it.

17:44.860 --> 17:49.331
- I was in jail for a year.
"I guess that's why I did not teache you."

17:49.580 --> 17:51.491
It must have been.

18:06.100 --> 18:08.375
There is nothing much.

18:08.580 --> 18:12.812
The Lazy Eleven cows
are now Circle Z.

18:13.020 --> 18:15.295
Okay, guys, let's see you try.
Leave the.

18:17.220 --> 18:19.450
That black over there.

18:52.940 --> 18:54.896
Hello, O.C.

18:56.220 --> 18:57.972
Hello, O.C.

19:01.340 --> 19:02.819
Hello, O.C.

19:03.140 --> 19:06.371
Hello, what have you been doing?

19:07.020 --> 19:09.739
"I'm glad to see you!"
"Nice to see you, too."

19:09.900 --> 19:12.619
You will not believe
what's going on here now.

19:12.820 --> 19:15.812
Supposedly outlaws, and
cattle thieves too.

19:16.660 --> 19:19.811
They are not. Just boys in the majority.
But what bad luck.

19:21.940 --> 19:25.774
I thought the judge had given you two years.
You left early, did not you?

19:28.820 --> 19:31.459
- I made a deal ..
"What kind of deal?"

19:31.700 --> 19:33.213
Just an agreement.

19:33.700 --> 19:38.979
Hey Butch, wait a second.
Listen, over your hut...

19:49.460 --> 19:53.533
Emma and I used your house
while you were away.

19:53.740 --> 19:56.812
- I hope you do not mind.
- No, O.C.

20:01.940 --> 20:05.250
Nice to see a feminine touch in place.

20:06.380 --> 20:08.848
She did not find the broom this morning.

20:10.940 --> 20:13.374
Butch, let her take care of it.

20:16.260 --> 20:19.570
She'll be here soon.
Go make us some dinner.

20:20.180 --> 20:23.456
Is she cooking, too?
You're a lucky man, O.C.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.335
What is this?

20:32.180 --> 20:34.489
We have our own saloon now.

20:59.420 --> 21:01.570
Very good.

21:02.500 --> 21:06.812
O.C., the next time you steal
something, it better be women.

21:09.540 --> 21:12.373
Hey you, the music. Stop!

21:18.460 --> 21:21.611
This is my friend, Butch Cassidy.

21:22.260 --> 21:25.570
Straight from
Wyoming to Laramie.

21:27.700 --> 21:31.090
Butch and I are going to
leave you idiots in shape.

21:31.780 --> 21:35.455
Let's get things organized here.
Who does not follow, will be fired...

21:35.700 --> 21:39.409
I'll tell you something else ..
Friends? A joke!

21:41.140 --> 21:43.779
Right, we surround the whole place.

21:45.100 --> 21:48.410
Get out without your guns!
And with your hands up!

21:51.380 --> 21:53.655
It's a hunt group.
They surrounded us.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.255
What are we going to do?
Think of something.

21:59.860 --> 22:02.090
We surrender.

22:02.300 --> 22:07.932
- Come on. Outside you.
- Come on. We have a long way to go.

22:08.580 --> 22:10.889
No, not him.
Hi, Butch

22:15.620 --> 22:18.259
Wait!.
Why do not you arrest him?

22:18.500 --> 22:22.812
He was in prison when Lazy
Pupan's cows were stolen.

22:23.020 --> 22:26.695
How do you know?
"I was there when he was released.

22:26.780 --> 22:29.578
What kind of deal did you make, Butch?

22:29.860 --> 22:32.215
What?
To get out of prison?

22:32.420 --> 22:35.457
It is?
Did you bring them here?

22:35.660 --> 22:38.458
I...
Do not be so silly, O.C.

22:54.620 --> 22:57.054
I'll kill you, Butch.

23:05.340 --> 23:08.935
I'd try to avoid him
when he leaves.

23:10.260 --> 23:12.569
Congratulations on a long life.

23:17.060 --> 23:21.815
You were released a week ago and have
already returned to Brown's Hole.

23:22.140 --> 23:25.496
Get yourself a job or something.
Stay out of trouble.

23:25.700 --> 23:29.136
I do not want a job, Ray.
This life is not for me.

23:29.220 --> 23:32.417
What about your promise to the governor?

23:32.660 --> 23:34.730
It was in Wyoming.

23:34.980 --> 23:37.289
"And that does not apply in Utah?"
- No.

23:37.380 --> 23:41.578
Have the decency to think of me
I do not want to arrest him again!
It would be very embarrassing.

23:41.780 --> 23:44.977
Right, Ray, same deal. I'm
out of your jurisdiction.

23:45.100 --> 23:49.412
"How many places can you promise to get away from?"
- It's a big country.

23:49.780 --> 23:53.534
Perhaps. But there is
more law than ever.

23:53.740 --> 23:58.177
Not old fools like me waiting for the
pension and hoping not to be killed.

23:58.380 --> 24:01.816
Young people, full of moral passion!

24:02.020 --> 24:04.488
You will not make deals with them.

25:30.860 --> 25:32.930
My God.
What are you doing out there?

25:36.940 --> 25:39.659
- Cool place you have here.
- Yes

25:40.660 --> 25:44.130
We, outlaws, live well.
What you want?

25:44.340 --> 25:47.889
- I thought about what you said
- About what?

25:48.140 --> 25:50.415
About you and me to unite.

25:50.900 --> 25:54.210
Oh?
I heard you work alone.

25:55.900 --> 25:59.415
Not long ago, you wanted
to join me, am I wrong?

25:59.700 --> 26:03.693
Now I'm not so sure anymore.
You are very temperamental.

26:09.540 --> 26:13.089
On the other hand, you
also have good qualities.

26:16.460 --> 26:17.415
It's ok.

26:30.060 --> 26:32.449
What's your name really?

26:33.580 --> 26:35.889
Longabaugh. Harry Longabaugh.

26:40.820 --> 26:42.970
It is not an outlaw's name.

26:44.940 --> 26:47.249
You also have no outlaw face.

26:48.540 --> 26:51.054
It's better to do something about it.

26:51.740 --> 26:54.208
- IT IS! As?
- I do not know.

26:54.780 --> 26:58.090
Get a scar, leave a mustache, I do not know.

26:58.340 --> 27:00.854
- I'm leaving a mustache.
- At where?

27:03.260 --> 27:05.490
Right here. See?

27:05.740 --> 27:08.891
"How long have you been the cuktiva?"
- Not long ago.

27:08.980 --> 27:11.574
- How much time?
"Not too long.

27:11.820 --> 27:14.288
It just grows slowly at first.

27:14.380 --> 27:18.214
"Should we steal anything or not?"
- Yeah, we should steal something.

27:19.220 --> 27:22.576
"How about a train?" Let's steal a train.
- A train?

27:25.660 --> 27:30.176
You do not go out robbing trains.
This requires practice.

27:31.020 --> 27:34.979
We have to work
together for a while.

27:35.300 --> 27:37.495
To progress

27:40.900 --> 27:43.289
- Casino - All right.

27:43.540 --> 27:46.930
That casino where you
failed last week.

27:48.260 --> 27:52.572
"I can not go in there." They would recognize it.
- Yes you can.

28:26.620 --> 28:28.770
Oh, God, no.

29:12.100 --> 29:14.534
I listened. Stand still 'cause I'll fix it.

29:16.980 --> 29:19.210
What are you doing out here for nothing?

29:19.540 --> 29:20.529
Do you think it's funny?
Do not.

29:21.380 --> 29:25.737
No one notices a tramp.
Is not that what you said?

29:26.300 --> 29:28.450
Come on, let's get out of here.
Is playing

29:28.700 --> 29:33.057
Did you see the money in that safe?

29:33.300 --> 29:35.256
I'm not going there.

29:35.540 --> 29:39.328
It's not so bad.
You get used to the smell.

29:39.540 --> 29:44.056
- Do you get it?
- Yes. Come now. You do not want?

30:13.300 --> 30:16.258
"You said it was not so bad."
- I lied.

30:17.380 --> 30:20.531
I took all the steps ..
You will love.

30:29.380 --> 30:32.213
Have we met before, have you?

30:32.380 --> 30:34.655
You're no stranger to me.

30:34.980 --> 30:37.289
I have a common face.

30:37.500 --> 30:40.697
"Everything in me is kind of average.
- It is a pity.

30:41.860 --> 30:44.055
- Where are you from?
- Canada.

30:45.020 --> 30:46.738
You look Canadian.

30:47.020 --> 30:49.375
This is ours. Dear

30:49.780 --> 30:51.930
What is that room?

30:52.180 --> 30:54.978
The red room.
But you can not enter with $ 20 only.

30:55.180 --> 30:58.775
Forget the expenses. The
red room looks good.

30:59.060 --> 31:03.497
Ruby, use this one. The spendthere
here wants the red room.

31:11.460 --> 31:14.577
- Let's share it with you!
- Share?

31:18.340 --> 31:20.934
My name is Butch Cassidy.

31:22.940 --> 31:25.329
This is Harry the possum.

31:26.420 --> 31:30.095
"I've heard of you."
"Why do you want to share us?"

31:30.220 --> 31:34.771
You look good people and I do not want to kill you.
But he would kill. Look at him.

31:34.980 --> 31:36.971
He's an animal!

31:37.180 --> 31:40.855
"What do you get?" About $ 20 a week?
- Yeah, I get $ 22.

31:41.980 --> 31:45.768
If we divide we will be
rich for the next 10 years.

31:45.860 --> 31:49.330
And no one will suspect you.
They'll think I did it.

31:49.540 --> 31:54.056
"Because I'm Butch Cassidy outlaw.
"And he's Harry Opossum."

31:55.100 --> 31:57.614
"Now open the safe!"
"Open up, Eliah.

32:03.980 --> 32:07.211
I'm going to have to knock you out
so you will not be suspicious.

32:07.420 --> 32:10.730
- Knock off?
- Not to look like
we're involved, idiot

32:11.940 --> 32:15.012
"Where do we leave the part of you?"
- Are you going south?

32:16.140 --> 32:20.816
One kilometer from the town there is
a fork leading to Steamboat Springs.

32:21.060 --> 32:24.973
Follow for 3 km until the shortcut of Yampe.

32:25.220 --> 32:28.895
There are two large marshes there.
has a large cavity...

32:29.100 --> 32:32.297
...on the right.
climb halfway

32:32.540 --> 32:34.815
How about under the
mattress down the hall?

32:34.900 --> 32:37.255
It is also a good place.

32:40.540 --> 32:42.895
I'm next.

32:48.460 --> 32:50.974
Butch, I've never hit a woman before.

32:52.780 --> 32:54.896
So do not hit her.

32:55.100 --> 32:58.854
Let's take it. It might be nice to
have a woman on the rails with us.

32:58.940 --> 33:02.933
You may even fall in love and marry her.

33:16.580 --> 33:20.732
- It was great! What are we going to do now?
"Do not get too comfortable."

33:45.700 --> 33:47.930
Hey, where the hell are you going?

34:45.420 --> 34:47.728
"Well, Butch.
- Excuse me.

34:53.500 --> 34:56.536
Okay. Go get your teeth.
Next.

34:58.820 --> 35:01.653
"I do not want to cut my hair."
- Sit down, come on.

35:09.620 --> 35:11.736
Come on, I have not got all day.

35:12.740 --> 35:15.891
Stopped!
Or cut your nose!

35:19.460 --> 35:22.020
Now slowly.
Very slowly when getting up.

35:26.500 --> 35:29.856
- Now, call the guard. Call him.
- Guard!

35:37.980 --> 35:40.255
Go there! Go!

35:41.340 --> 35:43.456
Who would say!

35:49.900 --> 35:54.098
Have you been to Telluride before?
"No, I do not think so.

35:54.340 --> 35:57.696
You would remember if you had been.
Great place.

35:58.460 --> 36:03.329
Many outlaws lurk there in the winter.
Great hotelsnn elegant restaurants

36:03.460 --> 36:06.850
"Do you think we're wanted?"
- Perhaps.

36:08.660 --> 36:10.173
Because?

36:11.300 --> 36:14.212
I do not know.
I've never been through this before.

36:15.220 --> 36:17.688
That makes you important.

36:18.260 --> 36:23.254
Well, if you want your name on a wanted poster, it's
better to be something better than Harry Longabaug...

36:25.340 --> 36:27.695
Minh mother liked.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.533
No, it's not possible, Harry.

36:38.060 --> 36:42.053
"I used Harry Alonzo for a while.
- Alonzo?

36:45.100 --> 36:48.251
Because?
That's my middle name.
Harry Alonzo.

36:52.940 --> 36:55.295
I'll keep it a secret

36:56.300 --> 36:59.929
- Alonzo - What's
wrong with Alonzo?

37:01.980 --> 37:04.699
Let me see Harry
Cherokee Charlie.

37:06.220 --> 37:08.654
Buck Barton.

37:11.020 --> 37:13.898
Johnny Ringo.
No, he already owns it.

37:16.060 --> 37:18.449
Lucky Wilson?

37:19.820 --> 37:23.096
Oh, come on. Can you help me.
I need inspiration.

37:23.340 --> 37:26.491
Have you ever done anything
interesting in life?

37:26.700 --> 37:31.012
"Well, I was in prison someday.
- At where?
- In Sundance, Wyoming.

37:31.540 --> 37:35.055
Okay. Kid Sundance.

37:37.860 --> 37:40.169
Sundance Kid.

37:45.060 --> 37:47.290
Yeah, I liked that one.

37:48.260 --> 37:50.137
I liked too.

37:51.140 --> 37:53.813
Actually I liked it so
much, I think I do.

37:54.580 --> 37:57.333
You can be Butch
Cassidy if you want.

37:57.580 --> 38:00.970
Hey, it was me who was stuck there, not you.
This is my name.

38:06.780 --> 38:09.169
Sundance Kid.

38:20.620 --> 38:24.295
There's nothing like it, Sundance.
You will love.

38:25.020 --> 38:27.295
It's Telluride!

38:27.780 --> 38:30.010
Hands up!

38:30.820 --> 38:34.017
- Yeah, I already loved it.
- For there.

38:35.740 --> 38:38.857
That's good.
Now give me everything you have.

38:39.380 --> 38:41.655
It's in here.

38:47.180 --> 38:50.855
- I can help you?
- Just stay still. Do not move.

38:51.100 --> 38:54.217
I'm standing still.
It's you who moves.

38:56.700 --> 38:59.055
Is this one of the outlaws that goes around here?

39:04.620 --> 39:07.771
Why are you trying to
steal innocent people?

39:08.340 --> 39:10.615
I need $ 500.

39:10.860 --> 39:15.695
- $ 500 dollars?
"Or what you can give."

39:15.900 --> 39:19.734
- I'll get the rest of the next one.
- The next popde to kill you.
"Why do you need all this?"

39:19.980 --> 39:23.734
"We have a little farm out of town.
"You and your wife?"
- Me and my mother.

39:23.940 --> 39:27.819
Had a bad year.
The plantations did not avenge, the cattle died.

39:28.060 --> 39:32.258
We can not pay the bank, and they
will come in the morning to receive.

39:32.460 --> 39:36.214
"You forgot the hungry dog."
Shut up, Sundance.

39:36.780 --> 39:38.930
What are you doing?

39:39.140 --> 39:42.212
"Shall I give him the $ 500 dollars?"
- All?

39:42.420 --> 39:43.409
That's it.

39:46.220 --> 39:49.018
Do not forget to tell
everyone that you know me...

39:49.420 --> 39:53.333
That Butch Cassidy gave you this.
Butch Cassidy?

39:57.020 --> 40:00.410
- You do not know who i am?
"No, I'm sorry, sir.

40:02.940 --> 40:05.329
Well, I am a well known outlaw.

40:05.700 --> 40:11.218
Maybe not so much here
but in Utah, Wyoming...

40:11.460 --> 40:15.135
"I think I heard about you, Mr.
- Cassidy.

40:16.180 --> 40:19.456
Yes, that's right, that's right!
Dutch Cassidy.

40:24.620 --> 40:27.930
I do not know about
you, but I'm freezing.

40:28.820 --> 40:32.859
Those $ 500 will buy us a
lot of good will here.

40:33.380 --> 40:37.658
Did you see the way that old man looked at me?
Like I'm some hero.

40:38.740 --> 40:40.935
Is that what you want to be?
A hero?

40:41.820 --> 40:44.288
Did not you ever want to be a hero?

40:44.380 --> 40:46.575
Have children admiring you?

40:47.060 --> 40:51.895
When I was a child, my hero
was an outlaw.
Mike Cassidy.

40:52.820 --> 40:56.290
I even got his name.
He was the best, Sundance.

40:56.820 --> 40:59.857
"I could beat him."
- what?

41:00.620 --> 41:03.896
"You've never seen him."
- I can beat him.

41:04.100 --> 41:06.295
You think it's so good, huh?

41:07.420 --> 41:10.173
I suppose Dr Holliday's
battery too?

41:10.340 --> 41:13.776
- I'll pop his head wherever he is.
"Be." He is dead.

41:15.220 --> 41:18.735
You did not say he was good.

41:21.740 --> 41:24.573
300... 400... 450...

41:41.220 --> 41:42.858
- Hi.
- What?

41:43.020 --> 41:45.614
It's dangerous to be here alone.

41:45.900 --> 41:47.811
Mostly with money.

41:48.020 --> 41:50.978
We will accompany you so that no one appears

41:51.180 --> 41:53.296
pull a gun and shoot his belly.

41:53.500 --> 41:57.971
He would steal it and bleed it in the snow.
Oh! Thank you

42:00.020 --> 42:01.009
Good luck!

42:03.020 --> 42:06.330
See, Sundance, we've
recovered our $ 500...

42:06.580 --> 42:08.775
and the old man has his farm...

42:09.060 --> 42:13.258
and we bought a lot of good will.
And it did not cost us anything.

42:15.060 --> 42:19.292
That old man is going to tell everyone
how Butch Cassidy is a nice guy.

42:19.500 --> 42:21.809
Do not you mean Dutch Cassidy?
Let's go

42:49.820 --> 42:54.052
"Can I get you another drink, sir?" Cassidy?
"No thanks, Jack.

42:56.580 --> 42:57.649
Here it is.

42:58.740 --> 43:01.015
"What are the five dollars for, sir?"
- what?

43:01.100 --> 43:05.252
"The five dollars... what are they for?"
- Do not know.

43:05.460 --> 43:07.451
- Stay with them.
- Thank you.

43:32.380 --> 43:37.408
I never thought I'd tire
of fun after two weeks.

43:41.460 --> 43:43.690
I need action.

43:48.700 --> 43:51.897
Lily?
- Not again

43:53.220 --> 43:56.417
I have to do something
to keep me from boredom.

43:57.740 --> 43:59.856
I could now.

44:12.700 --> 44:13.735
Let's go

44:25.540 --> 44:29.931
I bring a message from Hoffman Mine.
He says they die like diphtheria flies.

44:31.580 --> 44:36.370
"Why me?"
- I'll tell him.
He's the doctor.

44:36.540 --> 44:41.295
We have a load of serum in the Mail.
But it's snowy. No one
get there

44:42.860 --> 44:45.772
It seems that you are not
getting to him either.

44:46.020 --> 44:49.615
I'm looking for volunteers but I
do not think anyone is willing.

44:53.460 --> 44:55.690
Good morning Miss Daisy.

44:58.980 --> 45:02.336
"Butch, I saw an old friend of yours today.
- Saw?

45:02.580 --> 45:06.016
- I was in the store and saw O.C ..
- Hanks?

45:06.140 --> 45:08.415
How many do you know?

45:08.500 --> 45:12.812
"I said you were always here."
- Said?
"He's eager to see you."

45:13.100 --> 45:18.458
Still need someone to take the serum?

45:56.100 --> 45:58.330
- Need.
- We'll take it. I and he.
Come on Buck.

46:05.340 --> 46:08.457
Give me one good reason
to be doing this.

46:08.740 --> 46:12.050
- Only one. Because it's perfect.
"Not Butch, that's certainly not perfect.

46:12.220 --> 46:16.099
"We could have gone to the south where there are roads.
"Hanks could do that, too.

46:16.180 --> 46:18.740
The good thing about this is that he
will never think of following us here.

46:19.220 --> 46:21.609
That's because he's smart.

46:21.980 --> 46:26.053
You're staring the wrong way.
We were bored, were not we?

46:26.260 --> 46:28.455
This is an adventure.

46:29.780 --> 46:31.611
How far is it from this place that we're going?

46:34.860 --> 46:36.054
40 km.

46:38.620 --> 46:41.009
A 40km trip on this?
Just one way.

46:41.340 --> 46:43.649
It's just a way.

46:44.740 --> 46:47.015
It does not have to follow by 40Km in this.

46:47.300 --> 46:49.609
Let's get it easily.

46:50.900 --> 46:53.016
As?

46:56.900 --> 46:59.095
I do not know.

47:22.580 --> 47:25.378
"What do you call it?"
Delight in the snow.

47:25.580 --> 47:28.048
"You go through the snow like that?"
- Yes.

47:28.260 --> 47:31.775
"Do you have more of these things?"
- Yeah, in my cabin.

47:39.780 --> 47:42.977
I do not know, it seemed a
lot easier when you did it.

47:43.180 --> 47:46.889
- I've been doing this my whole life.
You will learn quickly.
- Yes

47:51.180 --> 47:54.490
Everyone does this, until
they get used to the skis.

47:54.700 --> 47:58.090
- You need to bend your knees.
- The knees.

48:57.380 --> 48:59.655
Hey, there are no mysteries.

48:59.900 --> 49:02.653
- There are some tricks.
- Yeah, like what?

49:02.860 --> 49:05.055
How to stop

49:14.460 --> 49:16.337
Sundance, are you okay?

50:28.380 --> 50:31.452
No more rest.
Let's continue.

50:31.540 --> 50:32.575
I can not.

50:36.260 --> 50:38.694
Are your legs cramping?

50:39.620 --> 50:42.976
They died two hours ago.
I'm freezing.

50:48.300 --> 50:50.655
Freezing? You're sweating.

50:52.460 --> 50:55.930
"Let me take a look at you."
- I have a throbbing headache.

50:58.860 --> 51:01.499
- I bet you got it.
- What?

51:01.700 --> 51:04.009
- Diphtheria.
- Oh no!

51:04.660 --> 51:07.572
Certainly from one of
the girls in Telluride.

51:07.940 --> 51:12.331
It's the 1st. they pass
on diphtheria to someone.

51:15.860 --> 51:18.294
Let's go. I'll help you get
up I will not be able to.

51:19.140 --> 51:21.495
Continue Sundance.
Save yourself

51:22.980 --> 51:25.414
There is no reason
for us both to die.

51:25.700 --> 51:28.009
You'd love that, would not you?

51:28.220 --> 51:32.452
Then you would be a real hero.
Dead heroes are the best.
Shut up.

51:32.900 --> 51:35.892
They could build a
great monument here.

51:36.140 --> 51:40.133
"Here jazz Butch Cassidy, outlaw and
hero, who died by taking serum...

51:40.340 --> 51:42.251
for sick children and dogs. "
- Shut up, Sundance!

51:42.460 --> 51:46.169
To hell with that!
You will not be a hero to the
at my expense, Butch.

51:47.180 --> 51:49.740
- Come on, get up now!
- I can not.

51:49.940 --> 51:52.408
Yes you can.
Yes you can, you know why?

51:53.140 --> 51:56.098
Because we have the damn
serum here in our luggage.

52:11.140 --> 52:14.052
We got the serum right here.

52:22.180 --> 52:24.740
On here. Get up Drink this.

52:24.980 --> 52:28.734
"You do not drink the whey, you donkey!"
"What is to be done with him?"

52:30.660 --> 52:35.814
I saw a doctor do this once.
He used a glass tube with a needle.

52:36.060 --> 52:40.497
He snapped at the guy's arm.
My God.

52:41.380 --> 52:43.575
Wait a second. Here it is.

52:54.900 --> 52:58.097
You should for the serum in the glass tube.

53:03.300 --> 53:05.973
- As?
- I do not know.

53:19.220 --> 53:21.529
Here it is.

53:27.860 --> 53:30.897
- Wait a minute.
"You almost did it.
Please try again.

53:37.780 --> 53:39.179
Oh shit!

53:42.540 --> 53:44.849
You had to get sick!

53:45.100 --> 53:47.694
You had to bring me
here and get sick!

53:48.420 --> 53:52.538
- I should leave it here!
"That's what I've been up to!"

53:58.740 --> 54:03.336
Just... go to hell!

54:09.100 --> 54:11.568
What... what is this?

54:14.820 --> 54:17.129
Did you hear something?

54:20.260 --> 54:22.933
Hello there!

54:25.660 --> 54:27.969
We brought the serum!

54:29.660 --> 54:34.017
We came from Telluride
with the serum!

54:35.620 --> 54:38.088
Why did not you come sooner?

54:38.580 --> 54:42.334
- Amtes?
- We've been asking for help a week ago!

54:42.900 --> 54:47.769
Son of a bitch!
I'm with a man here who's dying!

54:49.500 --> 54:53.379
- She died here.
Who died?

54:53.500 --> 54:56.697
My wife. Their mother.

55:04.700 --> 55:09.012
Well, Butch.
Then you finally got your parade.

55:09.260 --> 55:12.889
Sundance, next time
which I mention "hero",
Shoot me.

55:37.340 --> 55:39.774
You know what.
We should steal a train now, right?

55:40.020 --> 55:42.215
I'll be patient.
Be patient

55:42.420 --> 55:44.934
A train requires a lot of planning.

55:45.140 --> 55:48.928
Let's get out of here. You need to know schedules.
Changing routes, things like that.

55:49.140 --> 55:52.849
"And you need at least four men."
"Four men?"

55:54.140 --> 55:59.134
Yes. Mike Cassidy and I stole
the Denver Rio Grande in 1987.

56:01.300 --> 56:03.416
We stopped him with ease.

56:03.660 --> 56:06.618
We opened the freight car
in the blink of an eye.

56:08.580 --> 56:12.698
But..., we put dinemite on top
of the safe, and we lit up.

56:14.020 --> 56:17.251
We had no experience.
We were very dumb.

56:18.460 --> 56:21.179
We exploded the safe on
the floor of the car.

56:21.900 --> 56:24.016
He was trapped between the rails.

56:24.220 --> 56:28.179
We did not pick up or move the train.

56:28.380 --> 56:30.655
It was horrible.
We tried everything.

56:31.380 --> 56:33.655
"Did you just leave it there?"
We leave

56:34.180 --> 56:36.740
Maybe it's still there, as far as I know.

56:37.060 --> 56:38.891
Listen, we should...

56:40.940 --> 56:43.773
- What's it?
- Nothing.

56:44.540 --> 56:48.533
Act naturally, but
go behind a tree.

56:51.180 --> 56:53.614
That was for giving me, you pig!

56:54.940 --> 56:56.134
Are you you

56:57.300 --> 56:59.530
I did not deliver!

57:04.340 --> 57:07.889
It's insane. My
own men shoot me.

57:08.820 --> 57:11.254
- Sundance?
- What is?

57:12.500 --> 57:14.809
What happened?

57:15.060 --> 57:18.257
They did not hit you, and
they made a hole in me.

57:18.620 --> 57:20.975
- Let me see.
- Is nothing.

57:25.380 --> 57:28.816
I had never been hurt in
the shootings I was in.

57:30.460 --> 57:32.690
You will be fine.

57:32.940 --> 57:37.411
There's a good doctor in Circleville
about 50 miles from here. You can?

57:38.140 --> 57:40.893
Yes, no problem.
Let's get out of here.

57:53.900 --> 57:56.733
- I just have to stop a little.
- It's ok.

58:02.300 --> 58:03.733
I need to get down.

58:30.020 --> 58:32.534
Pond or bleeding.

58:34.220 --> 58:37.576
"No, it's not like that.
- So how is it

58:39.100 --> 58:41.489
Take a cartridge and open it.

58:42.100 --> 58:44.694
There's a tool in my bag.

59:12.220 --> 59:16.850
- Pour into the wound.
- Are you sure?

59:17.220 --> 59:18.733
Do it.

59:29.460 --> 59:31.610
- Now it lights up.
- What?

59:32.300 --> 59:35.497
- Take a match and light it.
- No.

59:38.260 --> 59:40.728
"Then give me a match and I'll do it."
- No.

59:42.540 --> 59:46.977
Butch, that's the only way to
stop the bleeding. Come now.

59:47.100 --> 59:50.410
This is going to hurt a
lot and it can kill you.

59:50.540 --> 59:52.895
It hurts a lot.

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:15.534
If it does not, it's going to go out, damn it.

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:03.255
You look so much better.

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:07.295
You need to wash.

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:35.289
What's your name?
Mary.

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:44.649
- Where we are?
- About 1.5 miles from Circleville.

01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:49.130
You should not talk too much.

01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:21.775
I'll tell him you're awake.

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:25.895
Tell him in an hour.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:50.573
The doctor said that you
will have a full recovery.

01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:57.775
How long have I been unconscious?

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:04.370
For a long time.

01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:09.336
Hi, look.

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:14.052
We thought it would be a
good gift when he woke up.

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:17.770
Mary shaved it.
It got much better as well.

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:19.369
Hey, Butch.

01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:24.135
- As for Mary...
- Yeah, what about her?

01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:31.256
If you still can not
think it can not give.

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:35.619
Well, it's best not to ..
In your state and everything.

01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:40.769
Besides, she's my wife.

01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:16.496
- What they want?
"Are you really Sundance Kid?"

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:21.337
- Who are you?
"Robert Leroy Parker Junior, sir.

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:24.896
I'm Sam.
Samuel Maximilian Parker, sir.

01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:28.700
I told you to get away from here.

01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:31.658
Okay, I was sleeping a lot.

01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:35.649
"Your mother says you have homework.
"I barely have it."

01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:39.897
She's very strict, Dad.
Moms are like that.

01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:43.209
Take care of them.

01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:46.418
"You can not trust women."
- Come on

01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:52.895
"Do you know Butch Cassidy?"
- He's an outlaw here.

01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:58.258
"Yes, I know old Butch.
- What's he like?

01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:03.249
He's short.
A little little guy.

01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:07.650
With small, burning eyes.
It looks like a mole.

01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:10.694
- Mai ugly the devil.
- Let's go guys.

01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:16.093
Sundance does not feel very well.
You can see that he is dekirando.
Let's go.

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:18.898
Good evening, Sundance.

01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:26.611
- You bastard!
- They do not know?

01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:32.489
That's how she wants it.
And I agree too.

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:41.691
"When was the last time you saw them?"
"The day before I was arrested.

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:46.649
Do not they think it strange
that you stay out so long?

01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:50.575
This is how it always was.
They think it's normal.

01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:58.257
- I'm sending money.
"Sooner or later they'll find out."

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:01.050
I've been thinking about it.

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:04.975
- Good night Good Night.

01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:11.734
"I want a dozen pork ribs."
- Yes ma'am.

01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:20.817
- It's a lot of Parker paper. This is expensive.
- Yes sir.

01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:24.212
"Give me 2 pounds of steak."
"I'll see you in a minute, ma'am."

01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:28.855
And take off the fat.
I do not pay for it.

01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:39.729
- Closer.
- Right.

01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:45.295
"What are you doing, Parker?"
- She asked me to take the fat off.

01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:49.849
If she does not like it from somewhere else.

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:52.210
"There is no other place.
- Aha!

01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:55.537
And stop bleeding the meat.

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:03.735
Very slow.

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:14.136
"Now it's my turn to be Sundance.
"You're still Cassidy.

01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:17.491
I do not want to be Cassidy!
He's an ugly dwarf!

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:19.770
So you're an ugly dwarf.

01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:22.932
Mom, Bobby does not
let it be Sundance.

01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:27.014
Bobby, let Sam be Sundance for a while.
Be it Cassidy.

01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:30.729
"I do not want to be Cassidy.
- Great. My own children.

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:33.773
"Cassidy does not do anything good.
- You heard?

01:08:33.979 --> 01:08:36.938
Cassidy does not do anything right.

01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:40.495
And then I said: Butch...

01:08:40.779 --> 01:08:45.058
if you put the dynamite on top
of the safe it will not open.

01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:48.969
But Butch is stubborn as
a mule and a lot uglier.

01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:52.178
I do not know how you handle it.

01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:55.134
And yet he put the dynamite
on top of the safe...

01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:58.816
he lit and
there was a huge explosion.

01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:04.292
When the smoke had dissipated the
safe had crossed the wagon -

01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:08.130
and was caught in the railroad tracks.

01:09:08.819 --> 01:09:11.812
"What did you do then, Sundance?"
"Yes, what did you do?"

01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:16.139
Being smarter than Butch.
How did you get the money out of the safe?

01:09:20.819 --> 01:09:23.095
Thank you, Mary.

01:09:23.899 --> 01:09:28.256
- What I did not tell you is that we stopped
the train on top of a bridge.
- A bridge?

01:09:30.819 --> 01:09:33.937
Did you stop the train
on a bridge to steal it?

01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:36.455
It's a perfect place, Robert.

01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:39.332
Even with the safe stuck in the rails,...

01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:44.853
was hanging on the bridge, so I just
needed Butch to hold my feet...

01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:47.649
I hung up and took all the
money out of the safe.

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:52.490
It was incredible that he
had not let go of his head.

01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:56.858
Boys, why do not you get the
Curley from the cream separator.

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:03.976
Why do you speak ill of me
in front of my children.

01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:10.694
I speak ill of you
What are you trying to do to me?

01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:16.175
I'm just telling stories.

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:20.857
Do not say that what
happened to me was with you.

01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:24.058
They think Butch
Cassidy is some idiot.

01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:28.938
Maybe he is.

01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:32.818
Excuse me, Mary.
Is very good.

01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:45.138
- What's the matter with you?
- I do not know.

01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:52.779
Yes I know.

01:10:55.060 --> 01:11:00.453
Today I heard in the city that
Mike Cassidy is stuck in Wyoming.

01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:06.734
Rob! Are not you going to try anything
like take Mike out of jail or something?

01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:11.334
Do not.
Mary, you know...

01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:15.533
Let his arrest, make you understand
that what you do now is right.

01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:19.893
"Be glad you're not there."
- Yes I stay.

01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:26.497
I know the last few weeks have been difficult.
I'll be fine.

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:29.894
As soon as Sundance has the
strength to get out of here.

01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:48.894
This water rose another 5 cm.

01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:58.015
Hurry up Parker, we have to open.

01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:07.655
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good Morning.

01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:11.177
It's late afternoon.
Four minutes late.

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:33.135
Where are you going, huh?

01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:36.298
- I have to leave for a while.
- because?

01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:39.692
Because someone who wants
to kill me is in town.

01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:43.017
"Does he know you're here?"
"Not yet, but you'll know.

01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:49.417
If I leave now he
will not hurt you

01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:51.735
And after he's gone?

01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:56.455
I'll stay hidden for a while.

01:12:56.660 --> 01:13:00.335
let things calm down and
then I'll come back.

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:02.775
"It's going to start all over again, right?"
- No! No you will not.

01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:05.575
And why are you taking this?

01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:08.209
Because you do not leave without it.

01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:11.534
Where are the boys.
I want to say goodbye to them.

01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:14.015
They're with Sundance in the creek.

01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:31.654
I'll be back.
I promise you that.

01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:38.775
Mary, I could not stop O.C. from coming.

01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:41.733
I know that.
It's not your fault.

01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:46.777
It's just how things are.
The one you are.

01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:50.329
Something always happens.

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:56.412
- Bye, Robert.
- Mary?

01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:35.210
- How are you doing?
- Do you want to try?

01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:39.255
I'd like to, Sam, but I can not.

01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:44.691
"I have to stay away for a while.
- because?

01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:48.452
- Something happened.
"Not that you go."

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:53.096
I do not even want a son
anymore, I have to go.

01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:56.375
So is Sundance going?

01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:00.338
Yes, Sam.
I think so too.

01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:09.816
Bobby, give your father a hug.

01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:28.738
Hey, try not to fight too
much in my absence, right?

01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:34.814
I kept it for your birthday, but

01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:38.212
You have to take care of it for me.

01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:52.570
Do you want to hold it for a moment?

01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:00.569
Listen well here, okay?

01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:05.730
You know how I say that Butch
Cassidy, is he an ugly bass?

01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:09.575
Well, that's not true.

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:12.015
He's a really nice guy...

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:14.889
and a little smarter than I said.

01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:22.013
Not the worst guy I've ever met.

01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:24.375
I want you to remember that, right?

01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:35.375
What was that?

01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:39.099
Anything.

01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:55.535
Why do not you bother this guy?

01:16:55.660 --> 01:16:58.493
If I kill him, I'll go back
to the starting point.

01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:02.775
And he shoots better shoot
than I would probably kill me.

01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:06.012
"But then your troubles are over, right?"
- Great.

01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:10.418
Who is this guy?

01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:17.649
- I do not think I heard him.
- What did you say?
- Hanks.

01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:22.410
What did you shoot me?

01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:26.699
Yeah, listen to Sunsance. He
did not look at you, shoot me

01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:30.615
"Then it's all right."
- Oh, he almost killed me.
- Sundance!

01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:37.051
You're not 100 percent yet.

01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:40.769
- If you falter you can lose
an arm or a leg ..
"I will not hesitate.

01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:43.579
"How can you be sure?"
- I've been practicing.

01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:47.855
Throwing in bottles?
They do not shoot back.

01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:52.331
"Just tell him I'm here."
- No.

01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:55.936
"Then I'll go there."
- OK Alright.

01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:05.257
Where are you going?

01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:51.294
"Listen to O.C., I do not want any problems.
- What did you say?

01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:54.249
That I want no problem.

01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:59.249
Is this your new system?
Infiltrate people from behind?

01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:02.370
I'm trying to save your life.

01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:05.130
Cutting my throat?

01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:09.373
I've never killed anyone and
I do not want to start now.

01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:12.697
"But there is someone out there who would kill you."
Who?

01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:19.489
Sundance Kid.

01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:24.338
"I have no quarrel with anyone by that name.
"Yeah, you do not?"

01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:29.054
When you tried to kill me at Ogden
Orchard, you hit him and not me.

01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:31.979
And he's not the forgiving type.

01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:35.896
So if I was you, I would go
out the back door and go.

01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:39.172
You're bluffing.
There is no one out there.

01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:40.972
There are sim, O.C.

01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:45.292
Believe me, he's the best I've ever seen.
Better than Doc Holliday.

01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:51.058
O. C. Hanks!
Come on, you cowardly pig!

01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:55.455
Go O.C., disappear from
here, while I distract him.

01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:00.374
He wants to fight, Butch

01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:06.178
O.C. Hanks does not pull anyone's nose.

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:23.251
When I finish him, Butch...
it's your turn

01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:36.650
I heard you have a complaint.

01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:40.773
I do not like people to
make holes in my body.

01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:44.131
I can understand that.

01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:48.775
How long does

01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:51.210
About a month, maybe

01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:55.578
I wonder if you've recovered.

01:20:56.500 --> 01:21:00.015
I think not.
Am I right?

01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:05.453
- I'll get the sheriff.
- Call... but later.

01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:08.649
But we'll find out, will not we?

01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:25.856
It hurts, does not it?

01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:30.889
Tell me Sundance, do you like water?

01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:38.050
Want more?

01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:51.735
I bet you're a little
slow, are not you?

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:56.458
- Come on, O.C., or I'll shoot you!
- I'm ready.

01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:02.453
"Get your revolver, kid.
- You first.

01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:13.536
It's 17 o'clock Get out
on the fifth ring!

01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:31.810
He pulled it out before!
Got it before!

01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:38.931
He is dead.
You shot the heart.

01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:43.573
I never knew how to
count, the bastard.

01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:46.574
He did not even hear it.

01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:50.090
"I did not want to kill you..."
- I know that.

01:22:51.060 --> 01:22:53.449
I just wanted to put a hole in it.

01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:56.572
- I had to shoot very fast.
- I know that.

01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:02.532
I've never killed anyone before.
I shook them, but I never killed them...

01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:06.294
Are you sure he's dead?

01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:25.050
"Who was this guy?"
- Who?

01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:26.848
Hanks.

01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:31.376
- It was cool.
- Thank you very much.
- Whereby?

01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:35.209
You should say he was a
pig that deserved to die.

01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:39.332
"Does he have any family?"
"Only five children.

01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:44.333
- Had she?
- No! Stop torturing yourself.

01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:50.297
He had no family. Just an old
witch with whom he lived.

01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:54.812
If you're going to get into shootings, you
can not choose just orphans for that.

01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:02.255
You have a visitor, Cassidy.

01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:07.290
- I do not know anybody. Go away.
- Your lawyers.

01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:17.653
When you want to leave, shout.

01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:23.060
Lawyers? They're in the wrong room.

01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:26.170
It's me. Butch.

01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:33.657
- Butch?
- Cassidy.

01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:50.895
You became somebody boy.
You are now a lawyer.

01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:53.611
No, I'm not a lawyer.

01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:56.095
Are not you a lawyer?

01:24:57.020 --> 01:24:58.897
What are you doing here?

01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:01.898
We came to get you out of here.

01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:08.849
I do not want to go out.

01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:14.090
There are other methods.

01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:19.011
We're going to give you a real lawyer.

01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:22.935
The best of Wyoming.
Cyrus Antoon, if necessary.

01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:28.775
Do you know how much it costs?

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:33.413
- How much?
"I do not know, but lots of money.

01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:36.730
We took the money in the bank.

01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:40.330
- Which bank?
- Anyone we choose.

01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:54.655
Damn it! She shifted.

01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:24.058
- Where is the bank?
- Over there.

01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:27.010
We have a deposit to make.

01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:30.337
Right. Just hand over
your weapons first.

01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:36.212
We have to protect this
until you're in the safe. It's the
that our boss said

01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:39.935
And we have to get the guns,

01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:48.050
That's what our boss said.

01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:51.328
Damn, I have to see this.
I'll be right back.

01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:11.336
What should we do?
Strangle everyone.

01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:29.774
Excuse me. I did not see you.

01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:34.093
Here, boy, get 5 cents.
Buy a new bag of popcorn.

01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:37.455
- It costs 10 cents.
- What?

01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:44.858
Then get 20 cents. Buy two
bags of popcorn. Sorry lady.

01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:56.896
Sundance, the door Come on.

01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:16.058
Thank you very much.
Hands up, everyone.

01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:20.130
Keep Calm We'll be leaving
in a few minutes.

01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:25.328
Keep everyone in sight.

01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:40.132
- What are you doing?
- This is enough.

01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:42.291
How so, enough.
For Antoons Fees.

01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:45.060
When will we have another chance like this?

01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:47.535
That's all we need.
I'm trying to straighten up.

01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:51.090
- You call that straightening up?
"Stealing just a little."

01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:14.934
This is enough.
I'm saying!

01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:39.818
Sundance. Look that. Little children
working for the damn railroad.

01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:48.494
- Hey, Butch!
- Harvey!
- I got your message.

01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:52.534
Carver and I worked on this
train to see what we found.

01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:59.570
Apparently there is a train full of money
that will leave in a few days of Frisco.

01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:03.055
- Who is he?
- Oh sorry.

01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:07.500
This is Harvey Logan known as
Kid Curry, Bill Carver, Harvey and
Sundance Kid.

01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:13.055
You have not heard the best yet.

01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:16.415
It's a mint train!

01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:19.094
There's a cash press in Frisco.

01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:23.937
Every once in a while they take
a load of money they printed...

01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:25.772
and carry it.

01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:28.494
On this train.

01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:33.290
"He leaves the day after tomorrow for Salt Lake.
"No, I think I'll quit."

01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:37.809
All right, excuse me. We do not need you.
I'm with you.

01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:44.016
"And who should plan the robbery?"
- I.

01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:48.772
- You think you're the only one around here
What do you think?
- This way, yeah.

01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:54.411
And we can only steal a
train if you show us how?

01:30:55.100 --> 01:30:57.614
- Right - So show us that.

01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:03.059
Why the hell!

01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:18.048
"Lords of the Jury, have you reached a verdict?"
"We have arrived, Your Excellency.

01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:22.376
We awarded the defendant Mike Cassidy innocent.

01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:31.736
Court dismissed.
Next case in 10 minutes.
It is the best country in the world.

01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:51.093
Ray, Ray, how's it going? Are not we going
in the saloon to get us drunk a little?

01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:55.657
"You will not get drunk, Mike.
Not as long as you do not.
- What?

01:31:55.820 --> 01:31:59.017
I have a hunch that
Butch Cassidy...

01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:03.292
stole the bank in Montpelier
to pay mr. Antoon.

01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:05.536
God bless you.
I think you owe him something.

01:32:06.380 --> 01:32:09.531
The Governors of three
states accepted...

01:32:09.740 --> 01:32:12.493
that if the Butch come back willingly...

01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:16.249
at the same time, they renounce
all charges against him.

01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:19.936
It would be great Ray.
The hard part is finding it.
You can do it.

01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:23.450
Listen here. People tell you
things, they do not tell me.

01:32:23.660 --> 01:32:25.935
Talk to him and fast.

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:31.134
If he commits an assault, the agreement
is undone. Now, get out of here.

01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:46.893
I do not have to agree
to this Bledsoe plan.

01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:54.976
It's only to follow that fret that he takes us
to Cassidy, and then we get him and the Kid.

01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:05.896
- I've been thinking...
- It may be dangerous.

01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:10.534
What do we do with Logan and Carver?
Why do not we do it at work alone?

01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:13.777
Two men just can not steal a train.

01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:16.535
Requires at least four.

01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:20.528
"And they must be on the train by now."
- You believe?

01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:25.371
The damn train does not stop! He passes straight through!
Nobody on board!

01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:30.495
There is no way to make the driver stop.

01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:34.488
"And the train has a detachment of cavalry."
- Cavalry?

01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:39.813
A wagon full of them.
The horses go in the front wagon.

01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:45.136
- That ruins everything.
- Not necessarily.

01:33:45.540 --> 01:33:49.818
That train will not stop for
horse guys next to the rails.

01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:53.410
You're right. We have to
get rid of the horses.

01:33:55.180 --> 01:33:58.058
And after stealing the train?
Are we going to run?

01:33:58.260 --> 01:34:03.892
"And how are we going to make the damn train stop?"
"Why does the train stop?"

01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:22.330
"Has anyone seen Butch Cassidy?"
He started off in that direction.

01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:26.499
Along with Logan and Carver.
Thank you guys.

01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:04.973
This is the last time I steal
a train with you, Butch.

01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:09.053
- Did you hear that?
- It's about time. My legs are numb.

01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:12.889
"I feel like urinating."
- I just did that.

01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:25.939
"I'm looking for Butch Cassidy.
"I think he went that way."

01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:42.617
"Where's Butch Cassidy?"
- I do not know him.

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:48.016
Listen, sir, if I did, I would not
tell you. Even if he killed me.

01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:53.335
The mint train.

01:35:56.820 --> 01:35:59.050
You two are thinking better, no?

01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:01.939
For starters, I thought
of that, right?

01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:04.410
I just wanted to be sure.

01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:43.258
"There seem to be many."
- I know.

01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:45.615
We can not deal with so many.

01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:48.852
They will not need to act right.

01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:15.220
Very well.
Are you ready? So it is now.

01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:43.615
Jump, you miserable ..

01:37:45.460 --> 01:37:47.690
I can only count on you.

01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:50.778
Do you think we can do that?

01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:53.934
- Do not know.
- I think we'll find out, uh.

01:37:54.980 --> 01:37:58.211
I'll get the driver and the stoker.

01:37:58.420 --> 01:38:02.857
Stay between the cattle
car and the Cavalry.

01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:36.410
It's ok. Good luck.

01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:39.215
- Continues.
- That's what I thought I would do.

01:38:39.460 --> 01:38:42.020
You chose the wrong train
to steal, my friend.

01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:45.371
There is a whole contingent
of cavalry on board.

01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:47.775
Not for long.

01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:50.653
- Butch, we got problems.
- What is?

01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:55.212
Harvey said the horses were ahead
of the soldiers. It's the opposite.

01:38:55.420 --> 01:38:57.854
- Damn it!
"They're behind them.

01:38:58.180 --> 01:39:01.650
"That changes the plans a little."
- I guess so.

01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:04.334
- Stop the train -
You want to get off?

01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:08.497
What do you think if I blow your brains out?

01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:15.698
"You can keep the cavalry."
in that wagon for a while?
- No problem.

01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:18.893
Vilte, and make it seem like
there are more people than you.

01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:22.251
"How many do you want me to have?"
"I do not know, a whole brigade."

01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:24.098
Give me your revolver.

01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:28.976
Well, you're lucky not to use it.
The cartridges are wet.

01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:32.934
Give me a few minutes to
get in and settle, right?

01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:03.855
Right. Stop!

01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:07.934
You have wet cartridges.
Wet cartridges do not fire.

01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:10.535
Want to test this theory?

01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:17.609
I've never felt so
safe on board a train.

01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:19.856
With all of you soldiers on board.

01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:24.212
We will do our best
to get you safely.

01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:32.009
- Why are we stopping?
"I do not know. I do not see anything."

01:40:40.140 --> 01:40:42.495
Is that water?
Give me that.

01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:24.096
Hello! This is a robbery.
Open the door please.

01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:28.293
Do as I say and open the door.

01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:32.055
I can see one of them.

01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:46.849
- What is it?
- Kerosene.

01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:50.456
What do you want with kerosene?

01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:53.660
Well, I have a match in my hand.

01:41:54.140 --> 01:41:56.449
Are you going to try to guess?

01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:19.058
- How many up there?
- Do not know

01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:25.854
"How many are there?"
- $ 25 thousand;

01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:27.533
Let's take two, please.

01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:42.090
There is much more there.

01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:45.975
- I just take clean two.
- I can help you with that.

01:42:46.060 --> 01:42:48.096
Why are you so helpful?

01:42:48.180 --> 01:42:52.219
This is funny. You know how annoying
it is to get on this wagon every day.

01:42:52.420 --> 01:42:55.139
I can imagine that.
All right, come on.

01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:06.170
Climb up and enter you.

01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:09.099
They're stealing the post office car, right?

01:43:09.460 --> 01:43:12.816
Yes. Are there any wounded?
- No.

01:43:13.220 --> 01:43:15.495
Will you do nothing to stop them?

01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:19.858
Not yet. I do not want to rush you.
They can hurt some civilians, sir.

01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:22.295
- Let's wait...
- But Captain!

01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:25.298
This is the American cavalry!

01:43:25.420 --> 01:43:29.208
When they try to escape, will
we come upon them like a hawk?

01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:39.770
Let's go back!

01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:07.290
I hope they do not create courage.
I only have five more bullets.

01:44:12.700 --> 01:44:14.656
"I'm not really sure.
- Let's go now.

01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:18.530
We have them now.

01:44:22.860 --> 01:44:25.169
They are coming in.
Get out of the way!

01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:29.898
Let's see if we can knock them down.

01:44:38.700 --> 01:44:43.216
"If you do not mind, you'd better not try that."
- Play then.

01:44:49.660 --> 01:44:52.493
Excuse me.
Thank you very much.

01:45:11.060 --> 01:45:14.291
- That's heavy.
"Then try to run with it."

01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:28.696
Shit! No more bullets!

01:45:38.700 --> 01:45:41.089
Sundance, I can not open the door.

01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:43.968
- Your suspenders!
- What?

01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:46.614
Give me your braces.
I had an idea.

01:46:25.620 --> 01:46:29.738
- It's stuck.
"Let's get all the ammo."

01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:07.894
Where's the machine gun?
I do not know.

01:47:20.780 --> 01:47:22.930
Come on, Sundance!

01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:33.250
Men are right, horses!
Let's get them!

01:47:41.460 --> 01:47:44.293
At where...?
Where are the horses?

01:47:45.700 --> 01:47:47.930
"Are you in charge?"
- Yes.

01:47:48.180 --> 01:47:52.014
"We need horses that are rested."
"Take whatever you want."

01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:53.653
They're right there.

01:48:02.740 --> 01:48:04.537
We got it!

01:48:06.140 --> 01:48:08.415
You shot some pretty good shots, you know that?

01:48:08.620 --> 01:48:11.498
They are only sldados.
I stare at them anytime.

01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:15.457
IT IS? Some day, sooner or
later someone will get us.

01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:18.811
In that case Butch, I vote in the "afternoon."

01:48:19.060 --> 01:48:21.733
I said you would have the poster you wanted.

01:48:21.980 --> 01:48:25.131
Motherfucker! We're going to get famous!
