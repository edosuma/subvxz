00:32.790 --> 00:34.082
Our sun is dying.

00:36.375 --> 00:39.625
And Union Corp controls all
of the remaining safe zones.

00:42.125 --> 00:44.707
The last safe haven from
our dying star's wrath.

00:47.332 --> 00:49.375
Those who are strong
enough to fight

00:50.790 --> 00:53.038
are forced to fight for credits

00:53.040 --> 00:54.665
in unknown galactic
solar systems

00:56.290 --> 00:59.580
in search of stardust.

01:21.750 --> 01:23.498
Citizen,
you are in possession

01:23.500 --> 01:25.205
of government property.

01:25.207 --> 01:27.207
Return the
identification sphere.

01:28.415 --> 01:32.498
Citizen, you are in possession
of government property.

01:32.500 --> 01:37.500
Stay, do not resist,
do not resist,

01:38.000 --> 01:39.998
or I will use lethal force.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.913
You are in possession of Code
two eight ba dess eight nine.

01:43.915 --> 01:46.663
Do not resist, or I
will use lethal force.

01:50.125 --> 01:52.457
Indian travel sphere, scanning.

01:56.832 --> 02:00.330
Citizen, you are in possession
of government property.

02:00.332 --> 02:02.415
Deactivating lethal force.

02:03.332 --> 02:04.873
Facial code accepted.

02:04.875 --> 02:06.207
Return to base.

02:07.665 --> 02:10.164
Facial recognition confirmed.

02:21.290 --> 02:24.163
Union Corp welcomes you.

02:24.165 --> 02:28.250
Union City, now accepting
armed, unallied humans.

02:30.457 --> 02:33.830
Proper build for a new tomorrow.

02:33.832 --> 02:36.625
A better today, a
brighter future.

02:38.165 --> 02:40.290
It all starts with Union.

03:00.582 --> 03:04.288
In this city, come join a
thousand lucky soldiers who are

03:04.290 --> 03:06.000
fighting for our future.

03:07.290 --> 03:08.790
Help get started.

03:57.415 --> 03:59.455
You look scared.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
sweetheart.

04:34.458 --> 04:35.291
Huh?

06:29.625 --> 06:30.913
Union Corp
invites you on a journey

06:30.915 --> 06:33.413
unlike anything in the universe.

06:33.415 --> 06:36.288
All non-accepted will
have a chance to enlist.

06:36.290 --> 06:38.288
The world needs you.

06:38.290 --> 06:40.913
Help join the fight
to save our world.

06:40.915 --> 06:42.582
awaits you.

10:08.750 --> 10:10.414
Dawnseeker.

10:10.416 --> 10:14.539
It's one of the meanest,
nastiest sumbitches

10:14.541 --> 10:15.583
we ever laid eyes on.

10:17.957 --> 10:20.790
Now Omnia Prime is home
to many, many surprises.

10:25.457 --> 10:28.664
Most of which are
designed to do one thing,

10:28.666 --> 10:30.041
and one thing very, very well,

10:33.916 --> 10:34.833
and that's kill humans.

10:36.750 --> 10:41.164
Or anything that doesn't
eat, breathe, or even shit

10:41.166 --> 10:42.458
the way they are used to.

10:45.416 --> 10:47.789
Now am I making
myself crystal clear

10:47.791 --> 10:49.375
as to what we are up against?

10:55.832 --> 10:59.125
Good, now the Dawnseeker
has one objective.

11:00.000 --> 11:00.875
One objective only.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.664
That is to find, extract
the precious asset

11:05.666 --> 11:06.541
known as stardust,

11:09.582 --> 11:11.289
which is the only thing that's
keeping that piece of shit

11:11.291 --> 11:13.830
floating rock we call
Earth from reverting back

11:13.832 --> 11:15.040
to the dark ages.

11:17.625 --> 11:20.455
So I'm not gonna have to
tell you how important it is

11:20.457 --> 11:23.914
that we locate the Stardust
and hightail our candy asses

11:23.916 --> 11:26.500
back to base straight
to Nemean, understood?

11:30.875 --> 11:35.457
Now as long as we have
this, we have him.

11:43.625 --> 11:44.832
You rise at oh five hundred.

11:46.791 --> 11:47.916
Get some rest, boys.

12:48.457 --> 12:49.664
It has like five
eyes or some shit.

12:49.666 --> 12:51.123
What do you think, Evo?

12:51.125 --> 12:51.957
Yeah.

12:54.707 --> 12:55.875
Miles to go.

12:59.541 --> 13:01.248
I'm gonna get you.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.498
Yeah, you know he gets it.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.375
The hierarchy.

13:13.832 --> 13:15.915
It's best you don't forget that.

13:17.041 --> 13:18.291
'Cause if you do?

13:19.916 --> 13:22.916
Ooh, remember this face.

13:23.416 --> 13:25.914
That's enough.

13:25.916 --> 13:27.330
Excuse me?

13:27.332 --> 13:29.125
That's enough, Otto.

13:34.082 --> 13:37.915
I'll be seeing you
around.

15:12.541 --> 15:14.623
Attention,
the reactor sector

15:14.625 --> 15:16.164
is being isolated.

15:16.166 --> 15:20.080
Repeat, the reactor
sector is being isolated.

16:02.500 --> 16:05.664
Attention, the reactor
sector is being isolated.

16:05.666 --> 16:09.375
Repeat, the reactor
sector is being isolated.

17:02.207 --> 17:04.415
I can't do this, Father.

17:06.415 --> 17:10.124
Fenix, you're more
important than you know.

17:11.290 --> 17:14.413
Look at your target and focus.

17:14.415 --> 17:17.080
You really think
I can do this?

17:17.083 --> 17:21.374
Fenix, one day you will be
called upon to change the world,

17:22.874 --> 17:27.333
and everything I have built
for mankind will belong to you.

19:10.708 --> 19:12.038
How many with you?

19:12.040 --> 19:12.873
Just me.

19:12.875 --> 19:14.288
Darby...

19:14.290 --> 19:15.332
Darby didn't make it.

19:17.540 --> 19:18.956
Shit!

19:18.958 --> 19:20.373
Where are the others?

19:20.375 --> 19:21.623
What happened to our ship?

19:21.625 --> 19:22.750
The others?

19:24.500 --> 19:26.998
I've been pinned down
here for over a week.

20:37.125 --> 20:39.500
Rendezvous at
these coordinates.

22:38.458 --> 22:39.913
Who are you?

22:39.915 --> 22:41.373
Name's York.

22:41.375 --> 22:42.873
York?

22:42.875 --> 22:45.456
Third battalion,
ninth level infantry.

22:45.458 --> 22:48.541
My planet has been mining
here in peace for generations.

22:49.958 --> 22:51.456
I don't follow.

22:51.458 --> 22:53.873
You are from Planet
Beta Four, right?

22:53.875 --> 22:55.623
Beta Four?

22:55.625 --> 22:57.123
You mean Earth.

22:57.125 --> 22:59.706
No, Planet Beta Four.

22:59.708 --> 23:02.498
I wouldn't know what you call
your planet, now would I?

23:03.915 --> 23:05.581
Tell me who sent you!

23:06.833 --> 23:08.375
Who sent me?

23:09.500 --> 23:11.456
What did they tell you?

23:11.458 --> 23:14.748
That you were on
some great mission?

23:14.750 --> 23:16.875
Some save the
world kind of shit?

23:18.165 --> 23:20.163
Nemean has been
stripping the resources

23:20.165 --> 23:22.623
from this planet for decades.

23:22.625 --> 23:24.413
It's time he learned to share.

23:24.415 --> 23:25.831
What are you talking about?

23:30.583 --> 23:31.583
We need him!

23:34.000 --> 23:35.873
We need him!

23:35.875 --> 23:37.706
Give me something!

23:37.708 --> 23:40.750
If we are to make it to
the rendezvous, we need him.

23:41.958 --> 23:44.498
He's been trying to
kill me for over a week

23:44.500 --> 23:47.123
and all you have is we need him.

23:47.125 --> 23:51.500
What she's saying is, if
I'd have wanted you dead,

23:53.083 --> 23:54.125
you already would be.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.288
You have a rescue party.

24:04.290 --> 24:05.332
I ain't gon' be here.

24:07.540 --> 24:08.875
The fuck are
you talking about?

24:11.165 --> 24:13.290
We were never meant
to leave this place.

24:14.750 --> 24:16.790
I'm impressed.

24:19.833 --> 24:21.375
Stiffen up and let's play?

24:24.083 --> 24:24.916
Yours cowboy.

24:35.250 --> 24:37.125
Show you guys something.

24:55.583 --> 24:57.623
Happened when your vessel
broke through the sky.

24:57.625 --> 24:59.288
What happened to him?

24:59.290 --> 25:00.790
I was hoping
you could tell me.

25:02.040 --> 25:04.123
How the fuck would we know?

25:04.125 --> 25:06.123
He was wearing
this fancy wristband,

25:06.125 --> 25:07.540
figured it meant something.

25:14.415 --> 25:15.250
Galen?

25:16.083 --> 25:17.541
Not far from your crash site.

25:19.083 --> 25:21.956
See, I figured his mono-pod
must've malfunctioned

25:21.958 --> 25:23.000
in the crash.

25:24.458 --> 25:26.291
No, pods couldn't
have caused this.

25:28.958 --> 25:30.750
This was done to him.

25:36.708 --> 25:37.875
How can you be so sure.

25:39.415 --> 25:42.625
Because, it is a perfect kill.

25:44.915 --> 25:47.415
Whoever did this wanted
us to find him this way.

25:50.333 --> 25:51.625
You get all that
from a dead body?

25:53.250 --> 25:56.581
No, and the fact that his
wristband is still intact,

25:56.583 --> 25:58.541
they were clearly
only after one thing.

25:59.833 --> 26:00.666
Which is what?

26:02.915 --> 26:03.750
Recognition.

26:10.915 --> 26:12.540
It says I am here.

26:20.790 --> 26:22.873
What about the mission.

26:22.875 --> 26:24.913
Hey, how will we get paid?

26:24.915 --> 26:28.163
A man is dead, our entire
purpose here is at stake,

26:28.165 --> 26:30.082
and you're worried
about your credits?

26:33.540 --> 26:34.707
Hey, he's dead, ain't he.

26:40.290 --> 26:42.956
It's more credits for me.

26:42.958 --> 26:44.708
And York, York.

26:45.915 --> 26:47.663
Say, tell me, they got credits

26:47.665 --> 26:49.665
on whatever the fuck
planet you're from?

26:50.500 --> 26:51.831
Huh?

26:51.833 --> 26:53.288
Why don't you and I go
get the stardust ship

26:53.290 --> 26:54.790
and double the price?

26:55.665 --> 26:56.665
Make that money.

26:59.500 --> 27:00.498
Huh?

27:00.500 --> 27:01.875
You hear me, are you deaf?

27:03.000 --> 27:04.831
I heard you?

27:04.833 --> 27:06.081
Then what's the problem.

27:06.083 --> 27:06.916
Let's get paid.

27:08.290 --> 27:09.707
There's only one problem.

27:10.915 --> 27:13.413
With your skills and
mine, we can make it

27:13.415 --> 27:14.832
all the way to the solar
fields, you know that.

27:15.875 --> 27:17.663
Come on.

27:17.665 --> 27:20.248
It's not what I found at
the crash that concerns me.

27:20.250 --> 27:21.500
It's what I didn't find.

27:23.583 --> 27:25.708
The Dawnseeker.

27:27.125 --> 27:29.038
Dead!

27:29.040 --> 27:30.165
How can you be sure?

27:31.415 --> 27:34.206
Because no one
could've survived that.

27:34.208 --> 27:35.623
Nothing!

27:35.625 --> 27:37.581
Whatever's shielding
us from what lies

27:37.583 --> 27:40.956
beneath the safe area,
it's the solar fields.

27:40.958 --> 27:42.000
What are those?

27:42.958 --> 27:45.913
Designed, created,
whatever they are,

27:45.915 --> 27:47.790
they protect us from
what's out there.

27:49.333 --> 27:51.663
Is that why they
built a city here?

27:51.665 --> 27:53.750
Different regimes
like to converge, trade.

27:57.415 --> 27:58.707
And what of your regime?

28:00.790 --> 28:01.790
Who do you fight for?

28:09.125 --> 28:11.915
I guess we're
about to find out.

28:32.833 --> 28:35.163
Jax, you're giving
away our position.

28:35.165 --> 28:36.582
To who, Evo?

28:38.665 --> 28:41.707
Face it, Jax,
we're on our own.

28:46.290 --> 28:47.956
Did you hear that?

28:47.958 --> 28:49.083
Yeah.

28:55.583 --> 28:57.166
Did you hear that?

29:00.208 --> 29:01.041
Don't move!

29:02.290 --> 29:03.125
It's us!

29:07.208 --> 29:08.208
How many with you?

29:09.833 --> 29:11.081
Anyone?

29:11.083 --> 29:11.916
Just us, why?

29:14.375 --> 29:16.375
Did you see anyone, anything?

29:20.415 --> 29:21.290
It's not possible.

29:22.500 --> 29:23.333
Jax.

29:24.375 --> 29:25.208
Just us.

29:32.208 --> 29:33.041
Jax!

29:36.958 --> 29:40.163
You ain't sending
us your location.

29:40.165 --> 29:41.000
But why?

30:01.875 --> 30:03.915
Evo, Evo, Evo!

30:20.958 --> 30:23.498
Hope that's looking
for something bigger.

30:23.500 --> 30:24.333
Shit!

30:40.165 --> 30:41.000
Grenade!

31:31.000 --> 31:32.040
Evo!

31:36.000 --> 31:36.831
Evo!

31:36.833 --> 31:37.788
Evo!

31:37.790 --> 31:38.625
Evo!

31:50.625 --> 31:52.206
What did this?

31:52.208 --> 31:54.581
Nothing I wanna
meet anytime soon.

31:54.583 --> 31:56.250
We need to get to the Space Ark.

32:00.165 --> 32:01.706
That's a lot of credits.

32:01.708 --> 32:03.913
The Space Ark doesn't sound
like it equals credits

32:03.915 --> 32:06.040
in my account, so I say
fuck it and fuck you.

32:07.165 --> 32:08.582
Let's go get some stardust.

32:13.458 --> 32:14.788
He has a transponder.

32:14.790 --> 32:16.665
Without it, no one's
calling a ride home.

32:19.250 --> 32:20.415
Hey, where you going?

32:26.040 --> 32:27.500
I said where are you going?

32:28.708 --> 32:30.333
Whoever took Evo
laid a trap for us.

32:34.040 --> 32:36.498
You aren't even
gonna look for him?

32:36.500 --> 32:37.998
Why?

32:38.000 --> 32:39.750
I can't grant him
passage to the afterlife.

32:45.250 --> 32:46.625
She's a princess.

32:47.875 --> 32:49.165
You're wasting your time.

32:52.250 --> 32:53.540
Yeah, I know who you are.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.375
Nemean Chord's very own.

32:58.540 --> 32:59.375
What?

33:00.790 --> 33:03.748
You think we wouldn't
recognize the boss's daughter?

33:03.750 --> 33:05.498
Tell me, since we're
all so expendable,

33:05.500 --> 33:07.663
how long before you
leave us all behind, huh?

33:10.500 --> 33:13.706
You wanna find your
boyfriend, go find him yourself.

33:13.708 --> 33:15.413
Otherwise, go to hell.

33:15.415 --> 33:16.250
You go first.

33:20.250 --> 33:22.623
Now here's what's gonna happen.

33:22.625 --> 33:25.081
We're gonna search
that trail over there.

33:25.083 --> 33:26.625
We're gonna get
that transponder.

33:27.833 --> 33:29.206
And then we're gonna
go find some stardust

33:29.208 --> 33:31.458
because I didn't travel
50 years for nothing.

33:34.625 --> 33:37.665
You, go grab the
stardust container.

33:48.665 --> 33:50.250
After you, princess.

34:34.166 --> 34:38.039
Stay back!

34:38.041 --> 34:38.873
Evo!

34:39.958 --> 34:41.373
Where is your transponder?

35:08.375 --> 35:09.208
Stay back!

35:14.208 --> 35:15.250
Help me.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.206
One of your faction members?

35:53.208 --> 35:55.206
No, I've never seen
energy like that.

35:55.208 --> 35:57.206
Felt like it was
toying with us.

35:57.208 --> 36:00.456
Thought you said this planet was
void of intelligent life forms?

36:00.458 --> 36:01.458
Void?

36:02.958 --> 36:04.208
What did they tell you this
place was back on Beta Four.

36:05.375 --> 36:07.331
Best to mine
stardust, nothing more.

36:07.333 --> 36:08.375
Mine?

36:09.333 --> 36:11.206
Stardust can only be
found in one place

36:11.208 --> 36:14.458
and one place only, and that's
where your dawnseeker breed.

36:15.625 --> 36:18.123
See they're born in tubes.

36:18.125 --> 36:19.998
They harvest the energy
from the stardust

36:20.000 --> 36:21.208
to hatch their larva.

36:22.416 --> 36:24.456
If they're as powerful
as I've read about,

36:24.458 --> 36:26.456
we got much larger problems.

36:26.458 --> 36:27.291
Hey!

36:30.958 --> 36:32.416
Look what I found.

36:38.291 --> 36:40.666
We have to figure out
what we're up against.

36:41.708 --> 36:43.123
You said twos.

36:43.125 --> 36:44.166
Pairs.

36:45.125 --> 36:47.000
Manipulating matter,
cloaking, energy,

36:48.208 --> 36:50.250
basically the ultimate
goddamn killing machine.

36:52.416 --> 36:53.458
Helmet was a dampener.

36:55.500 --> 36:57.373
What are you thinking?

36:57.375 --> 37:00.416
That it may still be figuring
out what it's capable of.

37:01.583 --> 37:04.331
And that's why it
didn't try to kill us?

37:04.333 --> 37:05.375
Nah.

37:06.916 --> 37:08.583
It's why it didn't
try to kill her.

37:14.166 --> 37:15.416
Where's the other one?

37:18.375 --> 37:19.208
Jax?

37:24.416 --> 37:25.956
Jax?

37:25.958 --> 37:26.791
Jax!

37:39.250 --> 37:40.083
Jax?

37:42.541 --> 37:43.375
Jax!

37:57.041 --> 37:58.333
Where'd she go?

39:33.666 --> 39:36.916
Oh, I got you.

40:39.541 --> 40:40.583
Get off me!

40:42.208 --> 40:43.291
No need to thank me.

40:48.416 --> 40:49.583
And who the hell are you?

40:50.541 --> 40:51.581
Do you have a ship?

40:51.583 --> 40:52.541
What?

40:54.333 --> 40:55.708
A ship?

40:58.916 --> 40:59.831
Ugh.

40:59.833 --> 41:01.083
Why'd you stop me?

41:02.708 --> 41:03.750
I almost had it?

41:04.666 --> 41:06.623
Going after a
dawnseeker is suicide.

41:06.625 --> 41:08.081
Not this one.

41:08.083 --> 41:09.706
It hasn't fully developed yet.

41:09.708 --> 41:11.206
How would you know?

41:11.208 --> 41:13.039
Because we brought
it from Earth.

41:13.041 --> 41:13.875
Earth?

41:16.166 --> 41:17.664
Terminus hasn't
destroyed it yet?

41:17.666 --> 41:19.206
Terminus ended centuries ago.

41:19.208 --> 41:20.708
How long have you been here?

41:24.166 --> 41:28.583
Okay, I say we follow it
through the north quadrant,

41:29.750 --> 41:30.664
wait for it to get thirsty,

41:30.666 --> 41:32.000
and then we'll find a way to.

42:40.583 --> 42:41.416
Jax!

42:44.625 --> 42:45.458
Jax!

42:53.666 --> 42:54.875
She was just here!

43:09.000 --> 43:11.416
Lieutenant Thane
of the Black Suns.

43:18.666 --> 43:21.416
Fenix, from Beta Four.

43:22.958 --> 43:24.750
We're searching
for a fugitive,

43:25.833 --> 43:27.875
highly skilled and dangerous.

43:30.791 --> 43:32.208
Can't say it rings any bells.

43:34.750 --> 43:36.083
What are you other men?

43:38.416 --> 43:42.125
We're just out on a
stroll, taking in the sights.

43:47.375 --> 43:48.208
And you?

43:49.875 --> 43:52.375
I'm, uh, I'm their guide.

43:55.708 --> 43:56.750
Hey!

43:57.875 --> 43:59.831
We haven't seen her.

43:59.833 --> 44:01.041
I will have answers.

44:02.541 --> 44:04.750
No honest mercenary'd be
caught dead in these parts.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.875
Unless you're trying
to hide something

44:09.208 --> 44:11.291
or looking for something
that needs to be hidden.

44:13.958 --> 44:15.748
Arrest them!

44:15.750 --> 44:18.414
Stripping and mining
this planet's resources

44:18.416 --> 44:19.791
is against galactic law!

44:32.416 --> 44:34.414
Call in the coordinates.

44:34.416 --> 44:36.333
Get a transport out
here immediately.

44:45.458 --> 44:47.831
You are making a big mistake.

44:47.833 --> 44:49.206
Dawnseeker has
breached your wall.

44:49.208 --> 44:51.289
He has adapted to
the magnetic pulse.

44:51.291 --> 44:52.998
We had similar gear in our tech.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.623
The only thing that
breached our walls

44:54.625 --> 44:56.914
is staring right back at me,

44:56.916 --> 45:00.206
and if you don't stop flapping
them two things on your face,

45:00.208 --> 45:01.541
I'm not gonna be so nice.

45:03.875 --> 45:05.331
Good!

45:05.333 --> 45:06.833
I wouldn't have done that.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.123
I want a pawn to rook
formation from corner to corner.

45:15.125 --> 45:17.873
Nothing moves out here
without me knowing about it.

45:17.875 --> 45:19.331
Is that clear?

45:19.333 --> 45:20.873
Sir, yes sir!

45:20.875 --> 45:22.166
Sir, yes sir!

45:29.708 --> 45:32.458
Defensive positions.
To the right!

45:34.416 --> 45:36.208
Cut us loose!

45:40.875 --> 45:42.166
Cut us loose!

46:04.333 --> 46:05.916
Defensive positions!

46:07.041 --> 46:08.581
To the right!

46:08.583 --> 46:10.456
I said cut us loose!

46:54.208 --> 46:56.000
Watch out!

48:38.000 --> 48:39.041
Go!

48:40.041 --> 48:40.875
Fall back!

48:42.166 --> 48:43.000
Fall back!

48:59.500 --> 49:01.166
E.M.P.!

49:09.458 --> 49:11.664
Oh, that seemed...

49:11.666 --> 49:12.873
different.

49:12.875 --> 49:15.623
That's because it was.

49:15.625 --> 49:17.456
It learned fast.

49:17.458 --> 49:21.083
No, this one was more
skilled, more adept.

49:22.291 --> 49:24.914
So got another one
of those on Beta Four?

49:27.541 --> 49:29.039
I think we may have
found his counterpart.

49:29.041 --> 49:30.331
What?

49:30.333 --> 49:31.248
You shitting me?

49:31.250 --> 49:32.208
There's another one out there?

49:33.166 --> 49:34.166
God!

49:39.208 --> 49:40.791
It's pinned us in.

49:42.708 --> 49:44.750
Because it didn't
try to harm any of us?

49:54.583 --> 49:57.875
Pulse wave knocked
out the solar fields.

50:00.458 --> 50:01.791
What's that mean?

50:04.208 --> 50:06.123
Whatever was on the
other side of the Space Ark

50:06.125 --> 50:08.833
just got an open invitation.

50:10.041 --> 50:12.456
We need to get to the
other side of the Ark.

50:12.458 --> 50:13.958
The other side.

50:16.291 --> 50:18.041
We need to set up a perimeter.

50:22.083 --> 50:23.373
We need to cross over.

50:23.375 --> 50:24.789
I thought you
said it wasn't safe

50:24.791 --> 50:26.539
on the other side of the Ark.

50:26.541 --> 50:29.248
That's before it was
less safe on this side.

50:29.250 --> 50:33.164
If I've learned nothing,
I've learned nothing's safe

50:33.166 --> 50:36.000
when the solar fields are down.

50:38.833 --> 50:39.791
Let's get the pikes.

50:45.666 --> 50:49.708
The way I see it is, Otto
is looking out for himself.

50:53.375 --> 50:56.331
And Thane only cares
about his men, so,

50:56.333 --> 50:59.791
so it's just you and
me, what do you say?

51:01.333 --> 51:02.791
Let's just try and make
it through the night.

52:22.250 --> 52:24.125
You know, I had a family once.

52:28.625 --> 52:29.458
Daughter.

52:39.208 --> 52:40.208
You remind me of her.

52:46.958 --> 52:47.791
Smart.

52:49.458 --> 52:50.291
Stubborn.

52:55.250 --> 52:56.458
Till we were low on credits.

53:03.750 --> 53:05.333
I did something I...

53:07.166 --> 53:10.166
Promised my wife
I'd never do again.

53:25.291 --> 53:27.208
There's a few truths
in this world.

53:31.291 --> 53:34.791
And never change, no matter
how much you want to.

53:38.583 --> 53:40.583
You can never trust
anyone but yourself.

53:44.500 --> 53:46.541
You just gotta ask
yourself one question.

53:56.250 --> 53:58.458
What do you think
they'll do to us by dawn?

54:10.375 --> 54:13.956
Know if my men are
compromised in any way,

54:13.958 --> 54:15.958
I will kill you myself.

54:18.416 --> 54:20.708
I caught this one
tampering with the pikes.

54:26.375 --> 54:30.250
Zan Desai, last
of the eternals.

54:31.541 --> 54:33.833
We've searched the galaxy
far and wide for you.

54:34.791 --> 54:35.875
The stories are true.

54:52.708 --> 54:55.539
I made my name taming dogs!

54:55.541 --> 54:58.041
You're wanted for the
destruction of planet Demo,

54:59.291 --> 55:00.706
the killing of the
alpha group known

55:00.708 --> 55:04.914
as the eternal Beta Four,
and numerous other charges

55:04.916 --> 55:08.041
of treason and evasion.

55:12.875 --> 55:14.500
Why'd you tamper with the pikes?

55:17.166 --> 55:18.333
How did you escape?

55:19.750 --> 55:21.456
I didn't mess with the pike.

55:21.458 --> 55:22.541
I activated it.

55:25.750 --> 55:27.623
You can't run
from the Black Suns.

55:27.625 --> 55:29.125
We always get our mark.

55:31.166 --> 55:32.333
I wasn't running.

55:34.416 --> 55:35.333
They have what I need.

55:50.083 --> 55:52.875
Thane, I think
we have movement.

56:23.500 --> 56:24.500
Check it out, now!

56:35.958 --> 56:37.041
Is it back?

57:11.708 --> 57:13.123
Move in!

57:17.625 --> 57:18.458
Go, go!

58:09.666 --> 58:11.166
Sucker punching piece of shit!

58:13.750 --> 58:16.625
Like I said, let's get to
the other side of the Ark.

58:17.583 --> 58:18.625
Hey.

58:22.250 --> 58:24.414
Why you always getting
your ass kicked?

58:24.416 --> 58:25.666
You're such a bad ass.

58:27.666 --> 58:28.914
Seriously, everybody
that meets you wants

58:28.916 --> 58:31.539
to beat the shit out of you.

58:31.541 --> 58:32.375
Let's go!

58:59.333 --> 59:01.373
In order for us to
cross over, we need to know

59:01.375 --> 59:03.789
what frequency the
Ark is vibrating at.

59:03.791 --> 59:05.541
Frequency, what's that matter?

59:06.833 --> 59:09.248
Well, we're operating
at a different frequency,

59:09.250 --> 59:11.208
it could trigger our
matter as hostile.

59:12.375 --> 59:14.916
Turn the would be
portal into a microwave.

59:16.166 --> 59:17.623
Precisely.

59:17.625 --> 59:20.164
And I believe there
are other mercenaries

59:20.166 --> 59:21.625
trapped just on the other side.

59:23.250 --> 59:24.414
You think they
left their ship.

59:24.416 --> 59:25.791
That's the idea.

59:29.625 --> 59:31.414
But what about
the Earth's sun?

59:31.416 --> 59:32.250
Stardust?

59:37.208 --> 59:38.250
Do they know?

59:39.791 --> 59:41.873
Know that you're a criminal,

59:41.875 --> 59:44.081
a treacherous
backstabbing snake?

59:44.083 --> 59:45.750
I think that was
made clear, yeah.

59:46.750 --> 59:47.956
Funny how
people never seem

59:47.958 --> 59:49.500
to ask the right questions.

59:50.791 --> 59:53.583
I suggested gagging you
but decided against it.

59:56.708 --> 59:58.333
How's Father doing nowadays?

01:00:04.166 --> 01:00:06.706
Father couldn't care less
about saving the planet

01:00:06.708 --> 01:00:08.833
and even less if you were alive.

01:00:10.458 --> 01:00:13.039
So you had to come
see for yourself.

01:00:13.041 --> 01:00:14.583
You're welcome.

01:00:16.125 --> 01:00:18.081
Some rescue.

01:00:18.083 --> 01:00:20.914
Don't look like
you needed rescuing.

01:00:20.916 --> 01:00:23.708
Do they know you sabotaged
the ship to crash land here?

01:00:25.625 --> 01:00:26.831
No more than they know
what you're truly doing

01:00:26.833 --> 01:00:28.083
on this side of the Ark.

01:00:29.666 --> 01:00:32.125
How long are you going to
keep up this little charade?

01:00:34.208 --> 01:00:35.498
As long as it takes.

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:38.914
I have no intentions
of saving Beta Four.

01:00:38.916 --> 01:00:41.081
Although I wish
your planet well,

01:00:41.083 --> 01:00:44.039
my job is to keep you
at bay while my employer

01:00:44.041 --> 01:00:46.498
obtains the stardust
for his self.

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:47.333
Hold me at bay?

01:00:48.958 --> 01:00:50.666
You son of a bitch!

01:00:51.708 --> 01:00:52.833
You could've fucking killed me!

01:00:54.291 --> 01:00:56.623
York's a galactic legend.

01:00:56.625 --> 01:00:59.791
Singlehandedly took down the
prison, ice prison in Pompeii.

01:01:01.166 --> 01:01:02.958
That's not a man
who's easily bested.

01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:14.541
Now tell me, what of
this other dawnseeker.

01:01:19.583 --> 01:01:21.248
It isn't a weapon.

01:01:21.250 --> 01:01:24.664
It's a living species,
and from what I gather,

01:01:24.666 --> 01:01:25.750
not from this planet.

01:01:26.666 --> 01:01:27.500
What do you mean?

01:01:29.166 --> 01:01:32.375
This Space Ark is a ripple
in time caught between realms.

01:01:34.041 --> 01:01:36.539
On their planet, the
dawnseeker's no different

01:01:36.541 --> 01:01:37.375
from you and I.

01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:41.833
A species with
multiple layers.

01:01:44.875 --> 01:01:46.081
That's why I'm on this side.

01:01:46.083 --> 01:01:48.581
In order to save Earth,
you must save the sun

01:01:48.583 --> 01:01:50.373
on the other side of the Ark.

01:01:50.375 --> 01:01:52.708
The Earth will exist in a
different ideal of time.

01:01:54.333 --> 01:01:57.289
So you're gonna keep those
things as trophies or what?

01:01:57.291 --> 01:01:59.581
Each member of the Black
Suns is born and bred

01:01:59.583 --> 01:02:00.458
on the battlefield.

01:02:01.791 --> 01:02:05.625
Where I come from, war
has no peace after it.

01:02:19.583 --> 01:02:20.416
Go.

01:02:24.041 --> 01:02:24.875
Go!

01:02:25.666 --> 01:02:26.500
Now!

01:02:28.166 --> 01:02:29.666
The Space Ark's right ahead.

01:02:51.875 --> 01:02:53.083
I knew you would be here.

01:03:09.875 --> 01:03:10.916
York?

01:03:11.791 --> 01:03:12.998
Are you alright?

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
We need a plan.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.081
What are you talking about?

01:03:17.083 --> 01:03:17.998
The Space Ark's right up there?

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.831
Yeah, but there's one problem.

01:03:19.833 --> 01:03:21.000
See, I have my transponder.

01:03:22.291 --> 01:03:27.291
Fenix has Evo's, and I'm
fairly certain, yeah,

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:29.875
there's no doubt,
you've got one.

01:03:31.208 --> 01:03:33.623
And I don't have to tell you
that without a transponder

01:03:33.625 --> 01:03:35.373
you can't cross over
the magnetic field

01:03:35.375 --> 01:03:36.208
to the Space Ark.

01:03:41.166 --> 01:03:42.000
So...

01:03:50.041 --> 01:03:52.081
Hey no, what are you doing?

01:03:59.958 --> 01:04:02.583
The way I see it,
someone's gotta be bait.

01:04:04.125 --> 01:04:05.123
If you destroy
the transponders,

01:04:05.125 --> 01:04:06.500
none of us can cross
through the Ark.

01:04:08.125 --> 01:04:09.708
You think I
wanna survive this?

01:04:10.583 --> 01:04:12.123
No.

01:04:12.125 --> 01:04:14.916
See, I know why the
dawnseeker won't harm you.

01:04:16.875 --> 01:04:18.083
'Cause you set it free!

01:04:22.583 --> 01:04:25.208
Why don't you be a
doll and hand it over.

01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:36.039
What are you doing?

01:04:36.041 --> 01:04:37.664
No!

01:04:44.958 --> 01:04:45.791
Stop!

01:04:48.791 --> 01:04:49.916
You're next, sweetheart.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:51.833
Now you.

01:04:58.791 --> 01:04:59.708
I said you!

01:05:14.125 --> 01:05:19.125
Go!

01:08:13.291 --> 01:08:14.331
We have to hurry up
and get the stardust

01:08:14.333 --> 01:08:17.246
before sun burns up
while we're not there.

01:08:17.247 --> 01:08:19.371
The order predicted
that the space time ratio

01:08:19.372 --> 01:08:22.413
between what's left of
Earth and the dying sun

01:08:22.416 --> 01:08:24.666
shouldn't be a
concern until 2240.

01:08:27.582 --> 01:08:29.413
Exactly.

01:08:29.416 --> 01:08:31.371
What year is it?

01:08:31.372 --> 01:08:33.038
It's July 2245.

01:08:33.041 --> 01:08:35.121
We have a very short
window to find the stardust

01:08:35.122 --> 01:08:36.621
and deliver it before we
have to seal ourselves

01:08:36.622 --> 01:08:38.791
into hibernation pods
again for the winter.

01:09:07.457 --> 01:09:08.290
Look.

01:09:09.916 --> 01:09:11.122
What's that?

01:09:12.247 --> 01:09:13.455
Is that?

01:09:13.457 --> 01:09:14.290
The Ark?

01:09:26.666 --> 01:09:29.166
This used to be
a portal to the other side?

01:09:30.747 --> 01:09:33.166
Transfusion fiber.

01:09:36.041 --> 01:09:38.705
This isn't just a gateway.

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:40.622
This is a time machine.

01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:04.582
Careful.

01:10:07.082 --> 01:10:08.705
Dawnseeker!

01:10:23.582 --> 01:10:24.415
Hey!

01:10:50.041 --> 01:10:51.330
We have to cross
through the Ark!

01:10:51.332 --> 01:10:52.373
Go!

01:10:52.375 --> 01:10:53.332
The Ark may close!

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:56.833
You need to get the stardust!

01:15:45.916 --> 01:15:47.750
The ship.

01:15:49.375 --> 01:15:50.207
Fenix!

01:16:44.082 --> 01:16:46.748
We need power to
the main console.

01:17:06.375 --> 01:17:07.291
Stardust.

01:17:08.582 --> 01:17:10.873
I've never seen
this type before.

01:17:10.875 --> 01:17:13.375
It's pure,
not from this planet.

01:17:14.791 --> 01:17:16.000
How do you know that?

01:17:18.457 --> 01:17:19.665
'Cause I brought it.

01:17:25.791 --> 01:17:27.291
We need to get off this ship

01:17:29.666 --> 01:17:31.666
and fly it directly
into the sun.

01:17:38.541 --> 01:17:39.875
Last chance?

01:17:49.942 --> 01:17:53.955
