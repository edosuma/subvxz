How Bruce are these McKicks?

00:19.291 --> 00:21.208
Only the Bruce-ist shoes ever!

00:21.291 --> 00:25.000
McFist has made yet another product
I literally cannot live without.

00:25.083 --> 00:27.000
We would totally die.

00:27.083 --> 00:29.417
I mean, we're McFist men

-McShorties, McTops.

00:36.375 --> 00:38.000
I even got a mouthful of McFillings.

00:39.166 --> 00:41.917
McFistios is my complete breakfast.

00:42.041 --> 00:44.750
My ride of choice is a McCedes. (grunts)

00:44.834 --> 00:47.750
McFist is so Bruce! He's the cheese!

00:47.834 --> 00:49.375
His name should be Bruce McCheese.

00:49.458 --> 00:51.583
He is my hero.

<i>I presume you have a plan.</i>

00:56.709 --> 00:59.375
Of course we have a plan.
(whispering) What's the plan?

00:59.458 --> 01:02.458
-I've come up...
-I've come up with...

01:02.542 --> 01:04.166
What have I come up with?

01:04.250 --> 01:07.166
We lure the Ninja into a
custom made deadly trap

01:07.250 --> 01:08.834
of my own devising.

01:08.917 --> 01:11.166
Lure. Ninja. Trap. My own devising!

<i>Fool! How do you expect to</i>

01:15.959 --> 01:18.000
Yeah, what are we going to use as bait?

01:18.083 --> 01:19.583
-Fool.
-(grumbling) Bait?

01:19.667 --> 01:21.083
It'd have to be something important.

01:21.166 --> 01:23.250
Something he has to save
like... a kitten!

01:23.333 --> 01:26.667
(moans) I was thinking
a pillar of the community.

01:26.750 --> 01:28.959
Someone beloved by all.

01:29.041 --> 01:31.709
What? Like that monkey astronaut
down at the zoo?

01:31.792 --> 01:34.750
(howling)

01:34.834 --> 01:37.625
-He's not so great!
-I was referring to you.

01:37.709 --> 01:40.417
Ooh, you really think I'm more
beloved than Neil Apestrong?

(Randy) Question:
Can McFist do anything wrong?

01:55.208 --> 01:57.959
Answer: No. That is why
I'm his number one fan.

01:58.041 --> 02:00.959
I thought you were the
Ninja's number one fan?

02:01.041 --> 02:02.625
Yeah, but I am the Ninja.

02:02.709 --> 02:04.500
I can't be my own number one fan.

02:04.583 --> 02:07.291
Ow! Building, that's a building.

02:08.667 --> 02:12.083
I am splitting at
the seams to present the new

02:12.166 --> 02:15.208
-McFistory history pavilion.
-(applause)

02:15.291 --> 02:16.667
Oh, come on!

02:16.750 --> 02:20.000
-A history pavilion?
-Epic McFail.

02:20.083 --> 02:23.333
This generous new addition
to our school is a gift

02:23.417 --> 02:27.458
from beloved Norrisville
philanthropist, entrepreneurist,

02:27.542 --> 02:30.959
and mustache enthusiast,
Hannibal McFist!

02:31.041 --> 02:34.458
-(cheering)
-You're too kind.

02:34.542 --> 02:37.667
This isn't about me,
this is about the children!

02:38.417 --> 02:39.667

02:39.750 --> 02:42.333
Also, snack bar's free till noon.

02:42.417 --> 02:46.250

-And he's back!

<i>Like dinosaurs, the wheel,</i>
<i>and those guys with hats.</i>

03:01.291 --> 03:03.125
Whoa!

03:03.208 --> 03:04.959
<i>This pavilion is filled with</i>

03:05.041 --> 03:08.792
<i>interactive, animatronic</i>
<i>displays of famous Norrisvillians.</i>

03:08.875 --> 03:12.375
<i>That's right. History</i>
<i>even happens here...</i>

03:15.208 --> 03:17.709
-History...
-Is the cheese!

03:17.792 --> 03:18.959
(all clamoring)

03:19.041 --> 03:22.375
That's legendary Crushing Corp
quarterback, Johnny Bueno!

03:22.458 --> 03:26.792
- <i>Go deep, for history.</i>
-So... lifelike.

03:27.792 --> 03:29.959
And that's Norrisville's
sweetheart, Monica Mo.

<i>Ooh...</i> (blows kiss)

03:32.250 --> 03:34.166
-(whistling)
-So lifelike.

03:34.250 --> 03:36.583
Uh, who's the dude hugging the cat?

03:36.667 --> 03:38.333
(scoffs) Are you for reals?

03:38.417 --> 03:41.041
That's famous adventurer
and author, Brawn Brickwall.

03:41.125 --> 03:42.709
He was seriously hardcore.

03:42.792 --> 03:45.291
(growling)

03:45.375 --> 03:46.583
He just ate a habanero pepper.

03:46.667 --> 03:48.917
That's two hundred thousand
skullville units!

03:49.000 --> 03:52.709
Behold the centerpiece
of the McFistory pavilion,

03:52.792 --> 03:56.792
the most important person,
in Norrisville history...

03:57.500 --> 04:00.083
-...the Ninja.
-(all) Wow!

04:00.166 --> 04:02.959
Oh, check it out! You are history.

04:03.041 --> 04:04.625
Then why am I getting a D in it?

04:04.709 --> 04:08.750
Yes... I sure do love the Ninja.

04:08.834 --> 04:13.750
Why, if I were ever in mortal peril,
I'd sure want the Ninja to save me.

04:14.458 --> 04:17.208
(clears throat)
I'd want the Ninja to save me.

04:17.875 --> 04:19.583
I'd want the Ninja to save me!

04:21.667 --> 04:24.458
(screams) I'm in mortal peril!

04:25.208 --> 04:27.208
Less wedgie, Viceroy.

04:27.291 --> 04:29.500
If it doesn't look real,
the trap won't work.

04:29.583 --> 04:31.583
-(chuckles)
-(dings)

04:31.667 --> 04:34.125
That robo-Ninja's got McFist!

04:34.208 --> 04:37.875
It appears we are
experiencing a robot uprising,

04:37.959 --> 04:40.583
At this time I invite all
students and faculty to...

04:40.667 --> 04:46.083
-...run for your lives!
-(all screaming)

04:46.166 --> 04:48.333
Somebody get the Ninja!
The real Ninja!

04:48.417 --> 04:50.125
(screaming continues)
What do I do?

04:50.208 --> 04:51.166
What do I do? What do I do?

04:52.375 --> 04:54.917
NinjaNomicon! I'll be behind that tree.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.709
You can't go Nomicon behind a tree.

04:56.792 --> 05:01.208
-What are you, an animal?
-No, the NinjaNomicon.

05:01.291 --> 05:03.792
The ancient book of
Ninja wisdom. Heard of it?

05:03.875 --> 05:07.208
(laughs) Oh! I thought
that was Ninja code for "bathroom."

05:08.583 --> 05:09.834
(grunts)

05:10.750 --> 05:12.917
(shouting)

05:13.000 --> 05:15.041
-(laughing)
-(continues shouting)

05:15.125 --> 05:16.750
What are those things?

05:16.834 --> 05:19.750
"Beware the enemy
who wears a hero's mask."

05:22.917 --> 05:26.125
That robo-Ninja's no hero.
Don't worry, I'm on it!

05:26.208 --> 05:27.500
(shrill shout)

05:28.166 --> 05:30.542
(grunts) I have to save McFist.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.208
If the Ninja saves McFist,

05:33.291 --> 05:34.875
think of all the free stuff you'll get!

05:34.959 --> 05:36.709
Just remember I'm a size six.

05:36.792 --> 05:38.250
Smoke bomb!

05:38.333 --> 05:41.375
Don't worry, Mr. McFist, the
real Ninja's here to save you.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.041
Mr. McFist? Robo-Ninja?
Anybody? Where'd they go?

05:50.583 --> 05:52.250
That can't be good.

05:52.333 --> 05:53.959
It worked, he's been duped!

05:54.041 --> 05:57.083
-We pulled off a dupe!
-Almost like it was planned.

05:57.667 --> 06:00.667
Ow! (grunts)

06:01.291 --> 06:02.542
What the juice?

06:06.417 --> 06:07.458
Johnny Bueno?

06:08.208 --> 06:09.417
(grunts)

06:13.458 --> 06:15.875
All right, Bueno, let's do this.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.041
-(shrieking)
-Ninja swing!

06:21.709 --> 06:24.625
Monica Mo? But you're
Norrisville's sweetheart.

06:24.709 --> 06:26.917
(all) Destroy the Ninja.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.083
Let's make history.

06:30.500 --> 06:33.542
Viceroy, here's how I see
the next five minutes playing out.

06:33.625 --> 06:37.000
Ninja destroyed, Sorcerer escaped,

06:37.083 --> 06:41.083
me, rewarded with
the superhuman ability of my choosing.

06:41.166 --> 06:44.333
Congratulations, sir,
I don't know how you did it.

06:44.417 --> 06:46.709
Sometimes I amaze even myself.

06:46.792 --> 06:49.208
What kind of power should I ask for?

06:49.291 --> 06:51.750
How about the power
to recognize sarcasm?

06:51.834 --> 06:54.500
Uh... When would I ever use that?

06:54.583 --> 06:56.458
(grunts)

06:57.458 --> 06:59.500
-Oh...
-(shrieking)

07:00.417 --> 07:01.375
Ah!

07:01.458 --> 07:03.125
Duck, duck, duck.

07:06.250 --> 07:07.834
(grunting)

07:09.041 --> 07:10.458
(shrieking)

07:11.709 --> 07:15.041
Yah! Monica was hot,
but that's ridiculous.

07:15.125 --> 07:18.125
(grunts) Oh, come on,
that was a great line!

07:27.291 --> 07:28.208
Boom!

07:28.291 --> 07:31.375
As the robots are currently
mid-revolution,

07:31.458 --> 07:36.917
your best chance of survival
is to do the robot and talk like a robot.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.250
(robotic voice) Bleep-bloop,
pleased to meet you.

07:40.959 --> 07:42.375
(horn honking)

07:44.291 --> 07:48.250
-We're good, it's robot!
-(all cheering)

07:48.834 --> 07:51.667
On the one hand,
the ability to fly would be cool.

07:51.750 --> 07:54.583
Then again, teleportation
has a nice ring to it.

07:54.667 --> 07:57.583
I'm at the office, bam,
I'm in the lab, bam,

07:57.667 --> 07:59.375
now I'm at the mall, bam!

07:59.458 --> 08:01.375
Sir, you better take a look at this.

08:02.625 --> 08:05.667
(growling) Stupid Ninja
destroyed everything!

08:05.750 --> 08:09.333
I just have to do it myself!
Get me the McSterminator!

08:10.917 --> 08:14.750
This is the McSterminator?
It looks like a bolo tie.

08:14.834 --> 08:16.208
Put it on.

08:16.291 --> 08:19.583
(growls) These things look ridiculous,
I've never been able to pull them off.

08:22.834 --> 08:25.500
Ooh! Now we're talking.

08:29.583 --> 08:32.625
Hand over McFist, giant robot who...

08:32.709 --> 08:35.625
I'm sorry, what historical
Norrisvillian are you supposed to be?

08:35.709 --> 08:37.959
I'm the guy who destroyed the Ninja.

08:38.041 --> 08:39.667
Nobody's ever destroyed the...

08:39.750 --> 08:41.417
(mumbling)

08:41.500 --> 08:43.542
No... Okay...
No, I see what you're doing.

08:49.709 --> 08:51.166
(growling)

08:55.583 --> 08:56.959
(grunts)

08:57.041 --> 08:59.709
-Hannibal McFist!
-(mumbling)

08:59.792 --> 09:02.041
(gasps) It all makes sense.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.458
The robots lured me here
by kidnapping you,

09:04.542 --> 09:06.583
then they forced you to fight me.

09:06.667 --> 09:09.000
They did? I mean, they did!

09:09.083 --> 09:12.291
-Why would they do that?
-Uh... er...

09:12.375 --> 09:15.333
(Randy) <i>Beware the enemy</i>
<i>who wears a hero's mask.</i>

09:16.000 --> 09:18.709
But you can't be the enemy,
you're Hannibal McFist,

09:18.792 --> 09:20.583
you manufacture awesome!

09:20.667 --> 09:23.959
It's called McAwesome, actually,
it comes out next month.

09:24.041 --> 09:27.667
Give me your home address
and I'll send you a case.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.125
What better mask for an enemy

09:31.208 --> 09:33.667
than that of the most
beloved man in town!

09:33.750 --> 09:36.041
That's right, Ninja. The most
beloved man in town

09:36.125 --> 09:39.458
-is about to blast you in the face!
-This can't be.

09:40.625 --> 09:42.000
It can be. Ninjadom!

09:43.750 --> 09:47.250
You're going down, McFist.
I'm telling everyone about you.

09:47.333 --> 09:48.583
No one will believe you.

09:48.667 --> 09:51.834
I'm Hannibal McFist,
lovable gazillionaire.

09:51.917 --> 09:53.375
I own this town!

09:53.458 --> 09:56.667
Then I'll just have to stop you,
right here, right now.

09:57.208 --> 09:58.750
(screams)

10:00.625 --> 10:02.250
Right now doesn't really work for me.

10:02.333 --> 10:05.166
Let's reschedule.
(screams indistinctly)

10:12.458 --> 10:14.125
(grunting) Yah!

10:17.959 --> 10:20.083
Did you save McFist? Is he okay?

10:21.333 --> 10:23.917
(all murmuring)

10:24.875 --> 10:27.750
(groans softly) Yes, McFist is safe.

10:28.625 --> 10:30.041
-(all cheering)
-Smoke bomb.

10:30.125 --> 10:33.250
It appears the killer robots
have been crushed!

10:33.333 --> 10:35.750
Of course, this means we'll have
to go back to teaching history

10:35.834 --> 10:39.375
the old-fashioned way.
Who feels like reading?

10:39.458 --> 10:41.250
-(all groan)
-(plays sad note)

10:42.083 --> 10:44.959
(Howard) So Hannibal McFist
is a bad guy?

10:45.041 --> 10:47.417
Really bad. Like all the way bad.

10:47.500 --> 10:50.041
My mind is blown, totally blown!

10:50.125 --> 10:52.291
Quick question: I know he's
your mortal enemy and all,

10:52.375 --> 10:54.709
but we can still buy his
super Bruce stuff, right?

10:54.792 --> 10:56.750
-No, we can't.
-(grumbles)

10:56.834 --> 11:00.125
-What about the McAwesome?
-The Ninja is boycotting it!

11:00.208 --> 11:03.458
But Randy Cunningham
will be first in line!

11:03.542 --> 11:06.458
How could I not be? It's got
"awesome" in the name.

11:06.542 --> 11:08.709
Show yourself, McFist!

11:08.792 --> 11:10.792
Just be quiet, he'll go away.

11:10.875 --> 11:15.000
-No, I won't!
-(Hannibal) Yes, he will.

11:17.291 --> 11:18.500
(shouts indistinctly)

11:18.583 --> 11:21.959
It is my duty as the Ninja
to warn you that I am

11:22.041 --> 11:25.208
currently in the zone,
and have been for about a week.

11:25.291 --> 11:26.625
(screeches)

11:26.709 --> 11:29.083
Oh, you don't believe me?
Let me tell you about Monday.

11:29.166 --> 11:30.291
Ninja flashback.

11:30.375 --> 11:32.583
Hiyah! Ninja eye-dios!

11:35.875 --> 11:38.625
-(screams)
-Ninja double kick!

11:38.709 --> 11:41.291
-(moaning)
-Yey!

11:41.375 --> 11:43.458
-That was awesome!
-Uh-huh.

11:43.542 --> 11:46.917
-Ninja, you are in the zone.
-The zone?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.667
Ninja time chop!

11:49.625 --> 11:51.041
(shouting)

11:51.125 --> 11:52.583
Ch-ch-ch-chop!

11:53.500 --> 11:54.959
It's nice knowing ya.

11:56.542 --> 11:59.959
Well, what do you know,
I am in the zone.

12:00.041 --> 12:03.166
(shouts indistinctly)
Yah! All right, you two...

12:03.250 --> 12:06.667
...three spider things?
Are you guys spider things?

12:06.750 --> 12:11.000
Let me introduce you
to the ba-boom zone.

12:12.875 --> 12:15.542
Wednesday? Yeah, nothing
really happened Wednesday.

12:15.625 --> 12:19.542
Point is, me, zone!
You don't want to do this.

12:21.709 --> 12:24.333
(grunting) I guess we're doing this.

12:24.417 --> 12:25.500
Yah!

12:25.583 --> 12:29.625
Ninja tail stab!
Thank you, thank you.

12:29.709 --> 12:34.041
Told ya! Zone. Yah!

12:34.792 --> 12:37.000
Once again you send
an incompetent robot

12:37.083 --> 12:39.458
to do a competent robot's job!

12:39.542 --> 12:42.959
Give me a break,
the Ninja is <i>en fuego.</i>

12:43.041 --> 12:45.625
You've lost a robot every single day!

12:45.709 --> 12:47.875
I didn't lose any on Wednesday.

12:47.959 --> 12:51.375
That's because I took
the entire company to Whoopee World.

12:51.458 --> 12:54.917
-(screaming)
-(laughing)

12:56.375 --> 12:57.875
I'm gonna hurl.

12:59.709 --> 13:01.750
Like your Whoopee
Wednesdays, do you?

13:01.834 --> 13:05.583
-Do I?
-Well, if you ever want another one,

13:05.667 --> 13:09.333
you'll build me the
deadliest monster ever!

13:09.417 --> 13:10.417
Huh.

13:10.500 --> 13:13.542
-(funk music plays)
-(Randy) Mm-hmm, okay. All right.

13:13.625 --> 13:16.709
Feeling good, zone in.
What's up, green hat?

13:16.792 --> 13:19.875
Mm-hmm. Okay, two, three girls!

13:21.583 --> 13:24.583
(grunts) Guess who's
getting his Way-bot. Ha, ha.

13:24.667 --> 13:26.625
Hey, look! It's that guy.

13:26.709 --> 13:30.083
Hmm? That guy?
I hate that guy! Get that guy!

13:30.166 --> 13:31.000
And to you I say...

13:31.083 --> 13:33.083
♪ <i>Zone</i> ♪

13:33.166 --> 13:36.333
Huh? All right, Nomicon,
you get two minutes,

13:36.417 --> 13:38.834
then it's back to the zone.

13:41.417 --> 13:42.250
Mmm.

13:42.333 --> 13:44.291
(screaming)

13:48.333 --> 13:50.583
"The only knowledge
a Ninja can possess

13:50.667 --> 13:53.125
is the knowledge that he
possesses no knowledge."

13:53.208 --> 13:55.125
Deep stuff, yeah, deep stuff.

13:55.208 --> 13:57.667
Well, here's some Ninja
knowledge I know I know.

13:57.750 --> 14:00.625
When you're in the zone...
winning's just plain easy.

14:01.667 --> 14:02.709
(grunts)

14:03.500 --> 14:05.166
(screeching)

14:05.250 --> 14:07.875
-Still in the zone?
-Still in the zone.

14:07.959 --> 14:09.125
Good, I'm counting on you

14:09.208 --> 14:11.000
to zone us through
our Spanish presentation.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.959
Howard, relax.

14:13.041 --> 14:15.125
Everything is <i>agua frijoles.</i>

14:15.208 --> 14:17.625
-(both sigh)
-Okay. You know you just said

14:17.709 --> 14:19.542
"everything is beans water," right?

14:19.625 --> 14:21.417
Don't try to psych us out, Debbie Kang.

14:21.500 --> 14:24.458
We're ready for this.
We've even been studying with Miguel.

14:24.542 --> 14:26.000
The guy who runs the burrito cart?

14:26.083 --> 14:28.917
He said our Spanish speaking
is <i>chile verde.</i>

14:29.000 --> 14:32.208
- <i>Chile verde,</i> Debbie.
-You guys are so stupid.

14:32.291 --> 14:36.375
Somebody woke up on
the wrong side of the taco this morning.

14:36.458 --> 14:39.875
Guacamole, Cunningham, guacamole.

14:39.959 --> 14:44.083
(speaking Spanish)

14:51.542 --> 14:54.458
-(grunts)
-Thank you, Debbie Kang,

14:54.542 --> 14:56.041
for that informative report

14:56.125 --> 14:59.834
on the very, very, very, very cute
and deadly Mexican death bear.

14:59.917 --> 15:02.667
<i>De nada, Senora</i> Jorge. (humming)

15:02.750 --> 15:06.625
(Jorge) <i>Senores</i> Cunningham
<i>y</i> Weinerman. <i>Su turno.</i>

15:08.375 --> 15:11.458
<i>Turno.</i> It's just "turn"
with an "o" at the end of it!

15:11.542 --> 15:14.083
(humming)

15:14.166 --> 15:16.750
Randy, why don't you <i>salsa roja.</i>

15:16.834 --> 15:19.542
-Ladies and gentlemen...
-And Debbie Kang.

15:19.625 --> 15:21.667
-(grumbles)
-Our report is on

15:21.750 --> 15:24.041
Spanish explorer, Ponce de Leon.

15:24.125 --> 15:26.041
(clears throat) And here I go.

15:26.125 --> 15:30.291
Ponce de Leon, <i>chimichanga</i>
<i>flautas, tamale nacho supremo.</i>

15:30.375 --> 15:33.875
Ah, but Ponce de Leon
is most famous for discovering

15:33.959 --> 15:37.625
<i>habanero quesadilla</i> .
Corn or flour tortilla.

15:37.709 --> 15:39.750
Burrito <i>grande</i> for listening.

15:39.834 --> 15:41.417
What was that?

15:41.500 --> 15:43.500
-Uh, Spanish.
-Mm-hmm.

15:43.583 --> 15:45.375
-Ha!
-(groans)

15:45.458 --> 15:47.417
I'm giving you both an "F."

15:47.500 --> 15:48.875
-(gasps)
-You're giving us an "F"?

15:48.959 --> 15:51.125
- <i>Si.</i>
-Oh, a "C."

15:51.208 --> 15:53.000
That's way better than an "F."

15:53.083 --> 15:56.291
-No, I am giving you an "F."
-An "F"!

15:56.375 --> 15:59.041
- <i>Si.</i>
-Are we getting a "C" or an "F"?

15:59.125 --> 16:02.375
I just need to manage
my parent's expectations.

16:02.458 --> 16:05.583
-(bell rings)
-An "F"? I did not see that coming.

16:05.667 --> 16:09.041
Howard, don't panic.
This is a small speed bump.

16:09.125 --> 16:11.000
Remember, I'm still in the zone.

16:11.083 --> 16:14.500
I'll just go back in there,
ask Jorge for some extra credit,

16:14.583 --> 16:17.583
and, boomo, F-o becomes a C-o.

16:18.250 --> 16:19.917
-(Howard screams)
-(roars)

16:21.333 --> 16:23.583
Right after I take care of that.

16:23.667 --> 16:25.000
No, no, no, priorities.

16:25.083 --> 16:28.291
First, our grade,
then snake-y, fly-y thingy.

16:28.375 --> 16:31.083
Relax. They're super easy to beat.

16:31.166 --> 16:33.333
I'll be back in, like, two seconds.

16:33.417 --> 16:35.834
-(roaring)
-(screaming)

16:38.041 --> 16:41.959
Hey! Hork up the band geek.

16:42.959 --> 16:44.166
Yeah, I said it.

16:45.875 --> 16:46.917
Ninja horking ball!

16:49.125 --> 16:53.500
-(moans) Whoa. Thanks, Ninja.
-(roars)

16:53.583 --> 16:55.500
Great idea, Viceroy.

16:55.583 --> 16:57.417
The Ninja destroys your first robot,

16:57.500 --> 17:00.959
so you go after him with the exact,
same stupid robot?

17:01.041 --> 17:03.375
(Viceroy) Oh, is that what I did?

17:03.458 --> 17:05.458
(Randy) <i>Stretch... Yah!</i>

17:07.041 --> 17:10.208
-And... the head's off.
-Wait for it.

17:10.291 --> 17:13.458
Back in the zone!

17:13.542 --> 17:16.500
Mexican death bear? (grunts)

17:16.583 --> 17:21.417
Ooh! Where'd you get a Mexican death bear
on such short notice?

17:21.500 --> 17:24.375
Now, over here, we have
the Mexican death bear.

17:24.458 --> 17:27.166
This creature is so deadly
that if it ever escaped...

17:27.959 --> 17:29.375
Uh... (clears throat)

17:29.458 --> 17:33.208
Who wants to be the first here
to try our new emergency exit?

17:33.291 --> 17:35.959
Mmm. Looks like
somebody in this room

17:36.041 --> 17:39.000
owes somebody else
in this room an apology.

17:39.083 --> 17:40.834
(humming)

17:40.917 --> 17:43.583
-Apologize to the man!
-Sorry.

17:45.417 --> 17:47.834
-(roaring)
-(shouting)

17:50.709 --> 17:51.542
Ninja doorknob!

17:55.250 --> 17:58.667
Okay, I got a death bear
situation going on here.

17:58.750 --> 18:01.625
I could really use a little
Nomicon sauce right about now.

18:01.709 --> 18:04.583
Why... won't... you... open?

18:04.667 --> 18:07.458
Oh, really? You're mad at me
because I blew you off before.

18:07.542 --> 18:11.041
Okay, fine. I'm sorry you couldn't
handle me being in the zone.

18:11.125 --> 18:14.750
I apologize. Now please help me!

18:14.834 --> 18:17.709
-Aah!
-Two seconds, huh?

18:17.792 --> 18:20.500
Oh, did I keep you waiting?
I'm so sorry.

18:20.583 --> 18:23.709
I lost track of time
fighting a death bear!

18:23.792 --> 18:26.458
Is it really fighting when you're just
getting your butt kicked!

18:26.542 --> 18:30.083
It's too fast, it's too strong.
I don't know how to beat it, okay?

18:30.166 --> 18:33.041
Think, Howard. What do we know about
Mexican death bears?

18:33.125 --> 18:36.542
-Who do I look like, Debbie Kang?
-(both) Debbie Kang!

18:36.625 --> 18:39.291
-Why are we saying "Debbie Kang"?
-She's like an expert on this thing.

18:39.375 --> 18:40.750
Her whole report was in Spanish,

18:40.834 --> 18:42.500
so she may have been
giving a flan recipe.

18:42.583 --> 18:44.875
Man, how good is flan? (screams)

18:44.959 --> 18:47.750
-Howard, Debbie Kang!
-(roaring)

18:48.792 --> 18:50.709
Debbie Kang, I need your help.

18:51.458 --> 18:53.417
Mmm... Hello?

18:54.083 --> 18:56.083
Seriously?
You're not gonna help me?

18:56.959 --> 18:58.792
Okay, fine, I admit it.

18:58.875 --> 19:01.667
Your Spanish is more Spanish
than my Spanish.

19:01.750 --> 19:03.375
Like all the way Spanish.

19:03.458 --> 19:05.875
Mmm. Now will you
turn around and help?

19:05.959 --> 19:07.250
(groans)

19:07.333 --> 19:09.917
Oh, hey, Howard.
Did you say something?

19:10.000 --> 19:11.959
Uh... Yeah.

19:12.041 --> 19:15.959
The Ninja's down the hall
fighting a Mexican death bear.

19:16.041 --> 19:19.291
(squeals) A Mexican death bear?

19:19.375 --> 19:21.625
So cute!

19:21.709 --> 19:24.792
(laughs) All right. What's
nerdball Kang rocking here.

19:24.875 --> 19:27.375
<i>"Hypno-Spanish"?</i> Hmm...

19:27.458 --> 19:29.625
(man speaking Spanish)

19:29.709 --> 19:32.375
<i>I am escorting</i>
<i>Spanish into your brain.</i>

19:32.375 --> 19:33.917
(all screaming)

19:37.458 --> 19:39.834
(grunts) Where the heck
is Debbie Kang?

19:39.917 --> 19:42.083
So cute! (squeals)

19:42.166 --> 19:44.083
Whoa-ho-ho, slow your roll.

19:44.166 --> 19:47.166
That is a very dangerous snake-bottom bear
you're running at right now.

19:47.250 --> 19:49.750
I just love them so much! (squeals)

19:49.834 --> 19:52.083
Same here. Quick question.

19:52.166 --> 19:54.917
-How do I kill it?
-(shudders)

19:55.000 --> 19:58.041
No, no, not so much "kill"
as "make him stop hitting me."

19:58.125 --> 20:01.125
Oh, that's easy. I did my whole Spanish
report about Mexican death bears.

20:01.208 --> 20:02.542
Wanna hear it? (speaks Spanish)

20:02.625 --> 20:05.250
No, no, no. No Spanish,
just the hitting. That's all.

20:05.333 --> 20:06.875
(groans) Okay, that's easy.

20:06.959 --> 20:08.709
Just rub his little tummy
counter-clockwise.

20:08.792 --> 20:10.208
That should put him right to sleep.

20:10.291 --> 20:13.375
-Rub his tummy?
-(growling)

20:14.375 --> 20:15.625
-(squeaking)
-(shouts)

20:16.291 --> 20:18.625
(grunting)

20:18.709 --> 20:19.959
Mmm... Oof.

20:20.041 --> 20:22.291
Sleepy bear, who's a sleepy bear?

20:22.375 --> 20:24.500
Does this feel nice?
Debbie, any thoughts?

20:24.583 --> 20:26.208
I'm rubbing counter-clockwise.

20:26.291 --> 20:28.583
Ugh, your other counter-clockwise.

20:28.667 --> 20:31.625
-Okay... Oh, all right.
-("Rock-a-bye Baby" plays)

20:31.709 --> 20:33.083
What do you know? Good call.

20:33.166 --> 20:35.875
Uh... Okay, I'll admit

20:35.959 --> 20:38.083
that did not go exactly as planned.

20:38.166 --> 20:39.542
The important thing is

20:39.625 --> 20:41.583
when we're at Whoopee World
next Wednesday,

20:41.667 --> 20:44.500
we're gonna look
back at this and laugh.

20:44.583 --> 20:46.083
(beeping)

20:46.166 --> 20:50.291
Buy Whoopee World
and ban the following people:

20:50.375 --> 20:52.166
-Viceroy.
-Mmm...

20:52.250 --> 20:54.625
-No, that's it, just Viceroy.
-Hmm.

20:55.458 --> 20:57.000
That was cold.

20:57.083 --> 21:00.166
-(man on recording speaking Spanish)
-Hey, what happened to you?

21:00.250 --> 21:02.667
-Howard!
- <i>Que pasa,</i> Cunningham?

21:02.750 --> 21:05.542
-What did you just say?
- <i>Le dije, "Que pasa,</i> Cunningham?"

21:05.625 --> 21:09.917
-You're in the Spanish zone.
-Hmm. <i>La zona Espanola.</i>

21:10.000 --> 21:12.625
(grunts) We have to get
you to <i>Senora</i> Jorge now.

21:12.709 --> 21:14.208
<i>Si, ahora, vamos.</i>

21:14.291 --> 21:17.875
No, no, no, no. Don't waste the Spanish.
Save it for the <i>Senora.</i>

21:17.959 --> 21:18.959
(guitar music plays)

21:19.041 --> 21:21.667
(sighs) A "Si." We did it.

21:23.083 --> 21:26.208
Okay, Nomicon,
I was kind of a jerk today.

21:26.291 --> 21:28.000
I should've listened. You were right,

21:28.083 --> 21:31.709
the only knowledge I poses
is that I possess no knowledge.

21:31.792 --> 21:33.375
And I'm not even sure about that.

21:34.542 --> 21:35.417
Hmm?

21:37.166 --> 21:40.667
So we cool? You'll keep
teaching me stuff and stuff?

21:40.750 --> 21:42.041
(groans)

21:53.208 --> 21:56.875
(screaming)

21:56.959 --> 22:00.750
Whoa! Dragon? Are you kidding me?

22:00.834 --> 22:02.709
And birds?

22:05.291 --> 22:08.000
(Randy) <i>When he realizes</i>
<i>he knows nothing,</i>

22:08.083 --> 22:10.750

So Bruce!
