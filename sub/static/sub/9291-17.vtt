00:14.240 --> 00:18.360
We have a problem. If that hard drive
is discovered by the Americans,

00:18.440 --> 00:20.440
it'll jeopardize the next phase of our plan.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.880
- "It's not here."
- Keep looking.

00:22.960 --> 00:25.040
Agent Drake?

00:25.840 --> 00:28.840
Drop the weapon now!

00:31.760 --> 00:33.600
- Jack's on the line.
- Jack, what is it?

00:33.680 --> 00:36.200
I pulled data off a hard drive
in Anderson's apartment.

00:36.280 --> 00:39.280
I believe Mitch Anderson's
trying to steal a Stealth fighter.

00:39.360 --> 00:43.000
We have reason to believe a Stealth fighter
has been stolen by a terrorist.

00:43.080 --> 00:46.440
- It's in your airspace as we speak.
- Just how sure are we about this?

00:46.520 --> 00:49.640
It's a near certainty, Mr President.
This is a Stealth aircraft.

00:49.720 --> 00:53.880
If he finds you, he may be on you
before your fighter escort can react.

00:54.440 --> 00:59.520
Mitch Anderson, we know who you are,
we know what you're trying to do.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.760
Captain Anderson? Captain Anderson?

01:02.840 --> 01:05.560
We've been cut off.
Is there an override channel?

01:05.640 --> 01:09.040
He cut off all communication circuits.
We can't do anything.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.960
Dad.

01:11.040 --> 01:13.320
I'm scared.

01:17.120 --> 01:21.000
Air Force One has been fired on.
Repeat, Air Force One has been fired on.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.880
Oh, my God.

01:26.160 --> 01:28.520
Was Air Force One just hit?

01:28.600 --> 01:31.080
Was Air Force One just hit?

01:31.160 --> 01:33.760
Escort pilots report...

01:33.840 --> 01:37.240
Air Force One has suffered an indirect hit
by an air-to-air missile.

01:37.320 --> 01:41.760
Pieces are falling to the ground
over the desert.

01:48.360 --> 01:51.080
This is Air Force One,
declaring an emergency.

01:51.160 --> 01:55.000
Repeat, Air Force One
is declaring an emergency.

01:55.080 --> 01:57.480
Copy. What is your condition? Over.

01:57.560 --> 02:01.240
Extensive damage
to the portside wing and fuselage.

02:01.320 --> 02:05.320
We've lost pressurisation.
Losing fuel pressure. Lower hydraulics...

02:05.400 --> 02:09.560
- Are those the coordinates?
- They're 20 nautical miles northeast of Indio.

02:09.639 --> 02:12.600
Edgar, contact local PD and EMS.

02:12.680 --> 02:15.000
- Alert them of the situation.
- On it.

02:15.080 --> 02:18.000
Tony, do we have
any CTU support teams in the area?

02:18.080 --> 02:21.080
The Las Vegas office
has two satellite teams available.

02:21.160 --> 02:24.680
I'm gonna dispatch coordinates
to all teams in LA and Vegas

02:24.760 --> 02:26.760
so they can start for the site now.

02:26.840 --> 02:29.520
Steady glide.
Left wing flaps damaged.

02:29.600 --> 02:35.400
Edgar, pull up satellite on the national park.
Pinpoint any possible landing scenarios.

02:35.480 --> 02:37.160
Chloe, what's happening?

02:37.240 --> 02:40.560
We've lost the signal.
They're moving and losing altitude.

02:40.640 --> 02:43.160
Change the frequency.

02:46.160 --> 02:51.600
- OK, I've got it.
- "... six knots. All engines are out."

02:51.680 --> 02:54.080
Going through 7500 at 210 knots.

02:55.120 --> 02:57.000
Roger, 210 knots. Sir...

02:57.080 --> 03:00.440
- Are you still reading coordinates?
- They're making the turn.

03:01.440 --> 03:04.680
Roger, I'm close to a stall.
We are putting her down.

03:04.760 --> 03:10.200
- "No gears deployed. We are still hard and fast."
- " OK. Roger that, Air Force One."

03:10.600 --> 03:16.360
Air traffic control, this is CTU. We are sending
EMS, police, and rescue teams to the site.

03:16.440 --> 03:22.280
- " Copy that, CTU."
- " Descending through 5500, 160 knots."

03:22.360 --> 03:27.800
- Chloe, what's showing on radar?
- " We are on the deck. Going in."

03:28.240 --> 03:29.800
Chloe!

03:31.000 --> 03:34.280
- Air Force One is down.
- " Air Force One?"

03:34.360 --> 03:37.600
Air Force One, do you read?
Air Force One is down.

03:37.680 --> 03:41.240
I got a confirm of scattered ground flashes
from the DOD satellite.

03:41.320 --> 03:43.600
Edgar, bring that up.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.720
- What's the status?
- It's down.

03:50.800 --> 03:54.600
- What's its crash like?
- Rough. We don't know if there are survivors.

03:54.680 --> 03:58.040
- Patch coordinates to all agencies.
- " Got it.

03:58.120 --> 04:00.440
- Anybody try subchannel comm stat?
- No.

04:00.520 --> 04:06.760
Secret Service has at least five personnel
on board. All of them have private channels.

04:06.840 --> 04:11.800
- " Comm stat three, operator."
- This is Bauer, password F-H-Ralphie-four.

04:11.880 --> 04:16.279
- " Go ahead."
- Flood AF1 with an acknowledge signal.

04:16.360 --> 04:17.680
Copy.

04:17.760 --> 04:21.560
Comm stat three calling AF1
one through five, please acknowledge.

04:21.640 --> 04:25.120
AF1 channels one through five,
please acknowledge.

04:25.720 --> 04:27.520
- " Channel three."
- Who's this?

04:27.600 --> 04:31.200
- " Patterson. We're down."
- What is the status of the president?

04:31.280 --> 04:33.480
I don't know. I can't move.

04:33.560 --> 04:37.600
Agent Patterson, my name is Bauer,
I'm with CTU. Rescue units are en route.

04:37.680 --> 04:40.120
What else can you tell me?

04:40.200 --> 04:43.240
I see some bodies.
I think we have some survivors.

04:50.240 --> 04:54.120
Mr Vice President,
I've just received confirmation.

04:54.200 --> 04:57.520
Air Force One sustained a hit
from an air-to-air missile

04:57.600 --> 04:59.680
fired from the stolen Stealth fighter.

04:59.760 --> 05:02.640
- Is the president alive?
- We don't know at this time.

05:02.720 --> 05:06.560
- When will we know?
- Hopefully within the next few minutes.

05:13.160 --> 05:15.040
Charles.

05:16.160 --> 05:18.640
We've known each other for 15 years.

05:18.720 --> 05:21.080
If I can offer some advice?

05:21.160 --> 05:23.560
Of course.

05:23.640 --> 05:28.080
We all hope President Keeler is alive,
but even if he is,

05:28.160 --> 05:31.720
it's very likely he won't be
in any shape to run the country.

05:31.800 --> 05:36.520
You need to make arrangements
to be sworn in to office as soon as possible,

05:36.600 --> 05:40.360
and the media should provide live coverage.

05:40.440 --> 05:46.040
The American people need to be reassured
that their leadership is intact.

05:46.120 --> 05:50.000
That's good advice, Mike.
I'll take it under consideration, but...

05:50.080 --> 05:52.720
I don't want to act prematurely.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.880
I understand.

06:00.480 --> 06:03.480
Well, we have to get to the White House.

06:03.560 --> 06:07.840
I've arranged for a security briefing
with the Pentagon.

06:07.920 --> 06:10.280
That's good.

06:14.440 --> 06:17.280
By now you all know
Air Force One has been shot down.

06:17.360 --> 06:22.160
One of the pilots following Air Force One
managed to get a visual of the fighter used.

06:22.240 --> 06:25.200
Pilot engaged and shot down the Stealth.

06:25.280 --> 06:28.320
The status of the president
is unclear at this time.

06:28.760 --> 06:32.200
Rescue teams are minutes away.
We'll know very soon.

06:32.280 --> 06:37.880
The man responsible for what has transpired
today, Habib Marwan, is still out there,

06:37.960 --> 06:40.080
and likely planning further attacks.

06:40.160 --> 06:44.440
I want every one of you
to rededicate yourselves to finding Marwan.

06:44.520 --> 06:49.720
I don't want a single lead ignored,
or shred of evidence missed.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.440
Let's get back to work.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.200
Michelle, let me talk to you.

06:57.320 --> 07:00.680
Uplink leads to a station
so we can start work on a priority list.

07:00.760 --> 07:04.840
We might not know exactly where Marwan is,
but he has to be in a 50 mile radius...

07:04.920 --> 07:08.680
Jack, I'm sorry, I just got off the phone
with the secretary of defense,

07:08.760 --> 07:11.040
and there's a higher priority than Marwan.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.400
- What?
- Recovering the nuclear football.

07:13.840 --> 07:16.400
- Didn't it go down with Air Force One?
- Not exactly.

07:16.480 --> 07:19.760
The missile inflicted enough damage
that it left debris.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.400
A lot was sucked out,
including the football.

07:22.480 --> 07:25.760
There's a transponder in the casing
so we know its location.

07:25.840 --> 07:28.560
Then the retrieval team
should have no problem.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.840
The secretary wants you to head that team.

07:30.920 --> 07:33.200
- Why?
- It's his top priority.

07:33.280 --> 07:37.360
That case contains the codes and locations
of our entire nuclear arsenal.

07:37.440 --> 07:41.840
Nothing is more critical than getting it back,
and as quickly as possible.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.120
Fine.

07:43.200 --> 07:46.640
- I'll organise your team, mobilise the units.
- Thanks.

07:46.720 --> 07:52.200
- What's the location of the football?
- 40 miles northeast of here, in the desert.

07:55.760 --> 07:57.760
Hey! Hey.

08:00.360 --> 08:03.040
What's wrong? What else is happening?

08:03.120 --> 08:05.120
Paul may have to go back into surgery.

08:05.200 --> 08:09.600
Apparently the bullet
did more damage than they thought.

08:09.680 --> 08:10.760
Sorry.

08:10.840 --> 08:14.040
If I had handled things differently,
if I had trusted him...

08:14.120 --> 08:16.640
Audrey, you are not responsible for this.

08:16.720 --> 08:20.400
I, and I alone,
made the decision on how to handle Paul.

08:20.480 --> 08:24.320
If you want to remain effective,
to be able to do your job,

08:24.400 --> 08:26.680
you have to let it go.

08:26.760 --> 08:31.400
Jack, that's your gift.
You're able to block things out.

08:31.480 --> 08:33.640
I can't do that.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.520
Jack, the chopper's waiting.

08:37.440 --> 08:41.039
- I have to change and get ready.
- All right.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.520
Honey?

08:59.080 --> 09:00.680
What's wrong?

09:00.760 --> 09:05.280
I don't know. Something woke me. It sounded
like some kind of explosion or something.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.800
Explosion? Nearby?

09:07.880 --> 09:09.720
I'm not sure.

09:14.680 --> 09:18.400
- It was probably just a bad dream.
- Yeah.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.920
You're still stressed, aren't you?

09:24.320 --> 09:26.960
I want you to try and forget about work, OK?

09:27.040 --> 09:30.120
Just focus on what we came out here for.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.480
To relax,

09:32.560 --> 09:35.400
and to make a baby.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.440
- " Look.
- What?

09:57.960 --> 10:00.160
- Watch your step.
- OK.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.840
Oh, my God.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.320
Kelly!

10:37.920 --> 10:40.120
What is it?

11:01.040 --> 11:06.400
If the president is unable to fulfil his duties,
Vice President Logan will assume office.

11:06.480 --> 11:10.320
- Cabinet will need to be briefed on the crash.
- I'll take care of it.

11:10.400 --> 11:15.040
Not all members are equal. State and Defense
need more detail than, say, agriculture.

11:15.120 --> 11:17.280
Yeah, I can handle it.

11:17.360 --> 11:23.080
- I want to make sure the transition is smooth.
- I understand, but I do know what to do.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.600
All right.

11:27.280 --> 11:28.760
Tony.

11:32.040 --> 11:37.320
I've noticed a little hostility on your part.
If it's because of me and Michelle...

11:37.400 --> 11:39.200
It's none of my business.

11:39.640 --> 11:44.680
And as far as the hostility goes,
I can promise you it's over with.

11:44.760 --> 11:47.560
Whatever you say. One more thing.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.240
I think the world of Michelle.
Loved working with her.

11:52.320 --> 11:55.520
Outside work, we never got off the ground.

11:55.600 --> 12:00.000
She never said why, but it didn't take a genius
to figure it out. She cared about you.

12:00.080 --> 12:02.320
If you ask me, she still does.

12:02.400 --> 12:06.680
Mr Buchanan,
rescue teams are inside Air Force One.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.920
We're picking up a live feed now.

12:16.840 --> 12:19.480
There's damage
to the fuselage and hatch.

12:19.560 --> 12:22.680
Go and check... check to see if he's alive.

12:26.320 --> 12:29.200
Check him. See if he's alive.

12:29.280 --> 12:32.080
Got a body here. She's dead too.

12:32.160 --> 12:35.200
The president
was in the conference room.

12:35.280 --> 12:37.640
Copy.
He was in the conference room.

12:37.720 --> 12:40.280
- " What?"
- " Got a survivor!"

12:40.360 --> 12:43.440
I'm going in. Keep close.

12:48.080 --> 12:50.160
Looks like the president's son.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.680
He's dead.

12:51.760 --> 12:55.280
- "Where's the president?"
- " This may be him."

12:55.360 --> 13:00.640
- " Wait, hold on. This may be him."
- " It's the president."

13:00.720 --> 13:04.680
He's still alive. I repeat, the president is alive.

13:04.760 --> 13:09.200
We need medevac teams in here ASAP. Do
you read that? We need medevac teams here.

13:13.320 --> 13:15.400
- Novick.
- " I have Buchanan."

13:15.480 --> 13:18.440
Yes, he's right here. Bill Buchanan.

13:20.640 --> 13:22.720
- Bill.
- Mr Vice President.

13:22.800 --> 13:26.600
I'm in direct contact with the teams
at the crash site of Air Force One.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.240
President Keeler is alive.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.200
- Thank God.
- "Yes, sir."

13:35.280 --> 13:38.960
But he's in critical condition.
He's unconscious, he's lost blood,

13:39.040 --> 13:42.640
there's no chance he'll be able
to lead this country, not for days,

13:42.720 --> 13:45.440
and probably much longer.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.480
- "Mr Vice President?"
- Yes, I'm here.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.480
This is all confirmed?

13:51.560 --> 13:55.280
The president is being medevacked
to the emergency centre as we speak.

13:55.360 --> 13:58.320
Sir, I recommend
you invoke the 25th Amendment

13:58.400 --> 14:01.120
and take control of things
as soon as possible.

14:01.200 --> 14:02.920
I understand.

14:03.560 --> 14:05.640
Thank you, Bill.

14:09.520 --> 14:12.000
Keeler's alive, but he's incapacitated.

14:12.080 --> 14:15.000
We should probably
contact the cabinet members.

14:15.080 --> 14:21.000
Actually, I've already put that in motion. Most
are standing by, the others will be very soon.

14:21.080 --> 14:24.920
- You did that without my permission?
- You had enough to worry about.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.880
I thought it best to be prepared.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.640
Yes.

14:31.720 --> 14:33.000
All right.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.920
Thank you.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.080
Shall I begin the process of collecting votes?

14:39.160 --> 14:41.160
Yes, go ahead.

14:51.280 --> 14:53.320
I can't get a signal.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.320
Try up here.

15:06.720 --> 15:09.680
- Got it.
- Kelly, look at this.

15:10.640 --> 15:15.400
- What is it?
- I'm not sure, but if it's what I think it is...

15:16.400 --> 15:22.600
I read this article, it's a funny name... I can't
remember, but it's got our nuclear codes.

15:22.680 --> 15:26.560
It goes everywhere the president goes.
He can launch an attack from it.

15:26.640 --> 15:29.480
- We gotta call somebody.
- Who are you gonna call?

15:29.560 --> 15:32.040
I'll start with the police, I guess.

15:32.120 --> 15:34.800
They'll put us through to the right people.

15:36.840 --> 15:39.880
The football transponder's
signal's still strong.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.320
- Hello?
- " Hey, it's me."

15:49.400 --> 15:51.760
- Hey.
- When I walked away from you at CTU,

15:51.840 --> 15:54.880
I felt like you didn't understand
what I was trying to say.

15:54.960 --> 15:58.680
I'm not telling you that you shouldn't care.

15:59.560 --> 16:01.080
I care.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.360
I care about you,

16:03.440 --> 16:06.440
I care about what happened to Paul.
I feel responsible.

16:06.520 --> 16:10.480
But this country is under attack.
I've got a job to do. I don't have a choice.

16:10.560 --> 16:14.080
Jack, I understand
what you have to do is very important.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.840
I just didn't want us to leave things like that.

16:16.920 --> 16:20.400
I'm glad. Me neither.

16:21.680 --> 16:25.960
- Hold on a second. I gotta take this call.
- Wait, Jack. Take the call, all right?

16:26.040 --> 16:29.440
Stay focused on what you have to do.

16:29.520 --> 16:33.200
- Yeah, I'll talk to you in a little while. Bye.
- "OK."

16:33.280 --> 16:35.400
- This is Bauer.
- Jack, it's Tony.

16:35.480 --> 16:39.400
I got a guy the police put through.
He's in the desert, says he found a case.

16:39.480 --> 16:43.760
- Jack, this guy found the football.
- OK, let me speak to him.

16:43.840 --> 16:48.160
His name's Jason Gerard. We're running
a check. I'm patching him through now.

16:48.240 --> 16:51.120
OK, Tony, stay on the other line.

16:53.120 --> 16:57.320
- Mr Gerard?
- Call me Jason. I'm with my wife, Kelly.

16:57.400 --> 17:01.080
My name is Jack Bauer.
I'm an agent with the Department of Defense.

17:01.160 --> 17:04.680
My colleague says you found
what we refer to as the football.

17:04.760 --> 17:08.119
It looks that way.
I don't know much about this sort of thing.

17:08.200 --> 17:12.560
- My wife and I are here on a camping trip.
- Why don't you describe what you found?

17:12.640 --> 17:18.119
Sure. It's a black leather briefcase, it's got
a number panelling over by the handle.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.760
It was in a case
with the presidential seal on it.

17:20.839 --> 17:24.960
That sounds like it. Right now I'm
in a helicopter. I'm about 20 minutes away.

17:25.040 --> 17:28.760
Look, I just want you
to hang out there and wait for me.

17:28.840 --> 17:32.000
I think someone beat you to the punch.
I see headlights.

17:32.080 --> 17:36.360
- How far away?
- It's hard to tell. A few miles.

17:36.440 --> 17:38.960
OK, just hold on a second, Jason.

17:39.040 --> 17:42.400
Tony, this kid says
he's got headlights headed towards him.

17:42.480 --> 17:45.440
- Do we have any ground units in his vicinity?
- No.

17:45.520 --> 17:47.120
Highway patrol, park rangers?

17:47.200 --> 17:49.160
- No.
- How can that be?

17:49.240 --> 17:54.080
We're spread thin, Jack. All state agencies
are still assisting with the evacuation.

17:54.160 --> 17:58.440
- Jason, are the headlights headed for you?
- Yeah, they're coming this way.

17:58.520 --> 18:01.920
Dammit! This situation
just got a lot more complicated.

18:02.360 --> 18:05.880
- What do you mean?
- The football has a transponder.

18:05.960 --> 18:10.440
It allows anyone to pinpoint its location,
as long as they've got the frequency.

18:10.520 --> 18:13.120
You think someone's got it
who's not supposed to.

18:13.200 --> 18:16.120
- We have to make that assumption.
- Who do you think it is?

18:16.200 --> 18:19.800
The terrorists who carried out today's attacks.
We don't have time.

18:19.880 --> 18:25.360
Remove the transponder and take the football
and get away from there as far as you can.

18:25.440 --> 18:26.840
All right.

18:26.920 --> 18:29.480
Flashlight. I need your light.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.360
OK, go ahead.

18:31.440 --> 18:34.160
The transponder's tiny
and it's hidden in the case.

18:34.240 --> 18:37.080
- It's designed not to be found.
- How will I find it?

18:37.160 --> 18:39.960
- "Do you have a compass and a flashlight?"
- Uh, yeah.

18:40.040 --> 18:41.280
- Get the compass.
- OK.

18:41.360 --> 18:45.160
OK. I want you to move the compass
over the surface of the case, slowly.

18:45.240 --> 18:50.160
The transponder puts out an electromagnetic
field. It should move the needle.

18:50.240 --> 18:54.120
Just move the compass over
the surface of the case and watch the needle.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.640
Here, here, here, here.

18:55.720 --> 18:58.160
- Keep the beam on the compass.
- OK.

19:18.960 --> 19:21.240
I think I got it. I found it. I found it.

19:21.320 --> 19:27.680
OK, good. Take a knife or a sharp rock
and start scratching the surface, hard.

19:28.720 --> 19:30.880
- Hurry.
- Dammit!

19:31.440 --> 19:34.320
- Jason, they're coming.
- Come on, Jason. Talk to me.

19:34.400 --> 19:37.080
I am working on it.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.800
OK. I think I got it.

19:39.880 --> 19:44.480
OK. Take the compass, put it over the scraped
area and tell me, is the needle moving?

19:44.560 --> 19:48.880
- No. No, it's not.
- You've disabled it. How far is the vehicle?

19:48.960 --> 19:52.120
- Not far.
- OK. Take the football and start moving.

19:52.200 --> 19:55.800
I don't care which direction,
start moving now. I'll get back to you.

19:55.880 --> 19:58.320
We gotta go. We gotta go now!

19:58.760 --> 20:03.560
Tony, I'm going to need surveillance
of the entire area put up to my screen.

20:14.640 --> 20:17.720
- " Why are we stopping?
- We've lost the signal.

20:17.800 --> 20:21.040
- How is that possible?
- Maybe it was damaged on impact.

20:21.480 --> 20:26.240
And itjust happens to malfunction
now that we're getting closer?

20:26.680 --> 20:29.000
Scan the area for cellphones.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.920
Active and passive signals.

20:38.240 --> 20:39.640
- Yeah?
- "Jason."

20:39.720 --> 20:42.720
We found a reserve power station
half a mile north of you.

20:42.800 --> 20:46.360
- That's right. I remember it from the map.
- I want you to go there.

20:46.440 --> 20:50.400
- OK, yeah. We'll get there.
- The station's a large, unmanned facility.

20:50.480 --> 20:54.960
I want you to break in and hide. Avoid using
your flashlight, and as soon as you hang up,

20:55.040 --> 20:58.000
- take your cell batteries out.
- The batteries?

20:58.080 --> 21:02.920
It'll prevent passive triangulation. In other
words, it'll stop you from being followed.

21:03.000 --> 21:08.080
- What if I need to contact you?
- Put them back in, but only if you have to.

21:08.160 --> 21:11.000
I'm gonna give you my direct line.
Have you got a pen?

21:11.080 --> 21:14.840
- Yeah. Hold on. Go ahead.
- 310...

21:14.920 --> 21:17.400
597-3781.

21:17.480 --> 21:19.800
"781." OK, yeah, I got it.

21:19.880 --> 21:22.800
- Start moving now!
- "OK."

21:22.880 --> 21:27.360
He said to take the battery
out of the cellphone. Come on. Come on.

21:29.920 --> 21:34.200
I had a cellphone signal for a few seconds.
It was moving, but it's gone now.

21:34.280 --> 21:37.600
- Did it move enough to yield a vector?
- Wait.

21:37.680 --> 21:41.440
Yes. It was headed a few degrees
west of north just before it cut out.

21:41.520 --> 21:45.720
Check the map.
See if there's anything near there.

21:46.960 --> 21:49.280
There's a reserve power plant.

21:49.360 --> 21:52.160
A kilometre away, maybe less.

21:54.440 --> 21:58.320
Whoever has the football,
that's where they're heading.

22:10.960 --> 22:13.720
" This is it.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.800
Stay back.

22:40.520 --> 22:44.840
We're not in any danger, right? I mean, how
could anyone even know that we're here?

22:44.920 --> 22:50.240
We're just being safe. A nice,
relaxing weekend in the desert, just like I said.

22:58.840 --> 23:02.280
They're here. I gotta call Jack.

23:02.360 --> 23:04.200
Come on.

23:08.800 --> 23:12.320
- This is Bauer.
- It's Jason. These terrorists, they're here.

23:12.400 --> 23:14.120
- How many?
- I just saw two Jeeps.

23:14.200 --> 23:17.280
- Where are you?
- Inside the plant. When will you get here?

23:17.360 --> 23:21.920
- Soon. Just stand by.
- Go, baby. Go! Come on. Just keep moving.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.920
Tony, it's Jack. We're out of time.
We need schematics for the plant now.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.800
Yeah, it should be on your screen
in a few seconds.

23:31.120 --> 23:33.240
OK, I got it. Thanks.

23:33.320 --> 23:35.840
- Jason, are you still with me?
- I'm with you.

23:35.920 --> 23:39.960
- "Which side of the building did you enter?"
- Uh, the south side.

23:40.040 --> 23:44.840
This is a large facility. I want you
to go to the lower level, southeast corner.

23:44.920 --> 23:49.840
- I'll find you there as soon as we land.
- OK. Hey, Agent Bauer? Please hurry.

23:49.920 --> 23:51.280
We are.

24:07.040 --> 24:09.120
Find them.

24:27.520 --> 24:30.840
There's got to be stairs somewhere.
Come on.

24:30.920 --> 24:35.280
- There. There they are.
- Wait. What if it's a dead end?

24:38.240 --> 24:39.280
Keep going!

24:43.080 --> 24:44.760
- A man and a woman.
- Where?

24:44.840 --> 24:46.920
This way.

24:47.960 --> 24:49.640
They went down here.

24:52.000 --> 24:57.200
Follow them and flush them out.
Go around and cut off the exits.

24:59.600 --> 25:02.040
Come on. Keep going.

25:02.120 --> 25:05.240
Come on. Go up there. Go up there. Go on!

25:06.120 --> 25:10.600
- Come on. Come on, come on, come on!
- OK.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.880
- Anything?
- Nothing.

25:40.440 --> 25:42.280
Helicopter.

25:42.360 --> 25:45.160
- Intercept it.
- Yes, sir.

26:18.040 --> 26:19.040
Jason.

26:19.120 --> 26:22.080
- Where are you?
- We've just landed. Where are you?

26:22.160 --> 26:24.280
Inside the plant, on the lower level.

26:30.560 --> 26:32.440
Jack. Jack!

26:33.640 --> 26:35.280
- Are you there?
- "I'm here."

26:35.360 --> 26:38.680
They're inside.
We cannot keep hiding, they're gonna find us.

26:38.760 --> 26:42.160
I know. You gotta keep moving.
I'll get right back to you.

26:47.280 --> 26:50.080
- Stiles.
- It's Jack. I need to speak to Audrey, now!

26:53.080 --> 26:56.280
- "Ms Raines, Jack's on line one."
- Jack.

26:56.360 --> 27:00.360
I'm taking fire. The other agent's dead.
I need the code for the football.

27:00.440 --> 27:01.680
All right, hang on.

27:07.360 --> 27:11.640
Just take the football.
Take the football. Come on!

27:17.280 --> 27:18.600
Come on!

27:37.240 --> 27:41.640
- Jack, *76114.
- I got it.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.640
- Hey.
- "Jason."

27:49.720 --> 27:54.720
I need you to open the case.
The combination is *76114.

27:54.800 --> 27:58.760
- Why? What is the point of this?
- Just do it. *76114.

27:58.840 --> 28:04.800
He wants us to open the briefcase. *76114.

28:06.480 --> 28:07.840
- OK, it's open.
- "OK."

28:07.920 --> 28:11.320
Inside should be a phone,
a control board, and the playbook.

28:11.400 --> 28:14.600
I want you to remove the book,
give the case back to your wife.

28:14.680 --> 28:16.400
The two need to stay separate.

28:16.480 --> 28:20.120
- Why?
- The board is useless without the playbook.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.040
I need you to split up.

28:22.120 --> 28:25.200
- He wants us to split up.
- I can hear him.

28:25.280 --> 28:27.840
- I am not leaving my wife.
- You have to.

28:27.920 --> 28:30.400
- Forget it.
- Jason, please. Listen to me.

28:30.480 --> 28:34.560
I know how scared you are, but if he gets
what he wants, he'll kill both of you.

28:34.640 --> 28:40.360
Right now, the only chance you have
to survive is to separate. Do you understand?

28:40.880 --> 28:46.080
It's OK, Jason. He's kept us alive this far.
Let's just do what he says.

28:47.080 --> 28:50.720
- Just get here as fast as you can.
- I will.

28:59.760 --> 29:01.800
I love you.

29:01.880 --> 29:03.880
I love you.

29:04.800 --> 29:07.760
Give me the backpack.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.200
Listen.

29:11.640 --> 29:14.000
- Here, you take the phone.
- OK.

29:14.080 --> 29:18.160
I want you to go to that top level there,
all right? I'm going to stay down here.

29:18.240 --> 29:21.520
- You just find a place to hide, all right?
- OK.

29:22.120 --> 29:25.440
Go, go, go. Go! Go! Go! Hide! Hide!

31:01.440 --> 31:02.760
" Hey!

31:51.560 --> 31:54.280
I've got him.

32:15.880 --> 32:17.960
He's clean.

32:19.400 --> 32:23.080
- Where's the control board?
- I don't know what you're talking...

32:34.240 --> 32:38.880
- Tell me what I want to know.
- I swear, I don't know. Please.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.240
It doesn't have to be this painful.

33:07.320 --> 33:08.320
Bauer.

33:08.400 --> 33:11.680
- They got my husband.
- Where are you? I'm on the lower level.

33:11.760 --> 33:15.560
We had to leave. We're on the second floor.
I don't know where.

33:15.640 --> 33:18.240
- OK, I'm on my way.
- They're gonna kill him.

33:18.320 --> 33:20.960
Kelly, stay on the phone. Keep talking to me.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.720
- I can't.
- Kelly!

33:23.800 --> 33:26.760
- Oh, please!
- Where is the control board?

33:28.960 --> 33:30.600
Stop!

33:35.720 --> 33:37.840
I have what you want.

33:37.920 --> 33:41.440
- Give it to me.
- First you let my husband go.

33:46.040 --> 33:48.040
No!

33:55.200 --> 33:56.960
OK.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.680
OK.

33:58.760 --> 34:02.080
I'll give it to you if you promise not to kill us.

34:04.480 --> 34:07.200
I won't kill you. I promise.

34:08.600 --> 34:11.000
It's over there.

34:11.080 --> 34:13.159
It's behind the pillar.

34:27.199 --> 34:30.400
- It's locked.
- What is the code?

34:32.800 --> 34:37.239
It's, uh... star 7-6-1-1-4.

34:43.679 --> 34:46.600
It's here.

34:47.080 --> 34:49.639
Let's go.

34:52.040 --> 34:54.360
" OK. It's OK.

34:54.440 --> 34:56.239
Kill them.

35:01.720 --> 35:02.840
No!

35:09.840 --> 35:13.720
This is Jack Bauer, I need a medic.
Second level, north end of the building.

35:13.800 --> 35:16.320
On our way there now.

35:16.400 --> 35:20.640
It's all right. He's gonna be OK.
Help is on the way. Where is the football?

35:20.720 --> 35:25.480
They have it.
They went out that door. I'm sorry.

35:25.560 --> 35:28.160
Don't be. You did great. Thank you.

35:28.240 --> 35:30.720
Air support, two hostiles left the building.

35:30.800 --> 35:34.960
I do not have possession of the football.
Repeat, I do not have the football.

36:00.360 --> 36:04.400
Air support, football is in the lead Jeep,
headed north. Take it out.

36:04.480 --> 36:06.440
I repeat, take it out.

36:31.080 --> 36:34.800
Put your hands where I can see them.

36:50.000 --> 36:55.760
Air support, I cannot see the football
in the vehicle. Shine your spotlight on me.

36:55.840 --> 36:58.320
And follow.

37:12.360 --> 37:18.320
Air support, I'm in possession of the football.
Go after the other Jeep.

37:31.480 --> 37:34.000
- Almeida.
- "It's Jack. I've got the football."

37:34.080 --> 37:38.040
Three hostiles down, one escaped.
I'm not positive, but I think it was Marwan.

37:38.120 --> 37:40.360
I'm sorry, but I had to make a choice.

37:40.440 --> 37:44.080
Marwan gave us the football
to buy his freedom?

37:44.160 --> 37:47.320
- Yeah, that doesn't sound right.
- What are you thinking?

37:47.400 --> 37:48.560
I don't know.

37:48.640 --> 37:51.760
Let me ask you something.
Is anything missing?

37:51.840 --> 37:54.200
No. All the components are here.

37:54.280 --> 37:56.480
Hold on one second.

38:08.240 --> 38:10.160
I was wrong. There are pages missing.

38:10.240 --> 38:13.280
Look, the sections are colour-coded.
What's missing?

38:13.360 --> 38:15.480
Red chapter, section three.

38:15.560 --> 38:18.800
- Get Audrey.
- All right. We'll call you right back.

38:19.120 --> 38:22.120
- All right, take care of it.
- Yes, sir.

38:31.440 --> 38:34.320
You're worried about him.

38:35.440 --> 38:39.320
I am. He seems unsure of himself.

38:39.400 --> 38:42.920
Oh, Mike, trust me.
He's spent his whole life preparing for this.

38:43.000 --> 38:47.400
He's just being cautious,
feeling his way along. He'll be fine.

38:49.960 --> 38:52.520
- Yeah.
- " The call came in, all in favour."

38:52.600 --> 38:55.200
All right, thanks.

38:55.280 --> 38:59.160
The vote was unanimous. The 25th
Amendment's been officially invoked.

38:59.240 --> 39:02.960
Tell the press we're ready. Let's get this done.

39:03.040 --> 39:06.240
Mr Vice President,
the 25th Amendment is in effect.

39:06.320 --> 39:08.080
- Any dissenting votes?
- None.

39:08.160 --> 39:10.320
We should proceed with the swearing in.

39:10.400 --> 39:14.160
Yes. The ceremony will take a minute,
then you can address the nation.

39:14.240 --> 39:17.840
I'm still not certain a live address
makes sense this time of night.

39:17.920 --> 39:21.320
After what's happened,
an awful lot of people are wide awake.

39:21.400 --> 39:24.160
I'm sure they'd like to hear from you directly.

39:24.240 --> 39:25.840
Yes, of course.

39:27.920 --> 39:29.560
" We're ready, sir.

39:50.240 --> 39:52.640
" Please. Please.

39:52.720 --> 39:55.240
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.200
- Yeah.
- "Jack, it's Tony."

39:58.280 --> 40:00.560
- Is Audrey there?
- Jack, I'm here.

40:00.640 --> 40:02.760
Tell me the contents of the pages.

40:02.840 --> 40:06.760
It's the section which contains
warhead locations and activation codes.

40:06.840 --> 40:10.240
We started cancelling codes
as soon as Air Force One went down.

40:10.320 --> 40:13.520
But there are thousands of warheads.
It's gonna take an hour.

40:13.600 --> 40:17.400
In the meantime, if they get ahold
of a warhead and a matching code,

40:17.480 --> 40:19.360
we will not be able to stop them.

40:19.440 --> 40:22.520
Copy that. I'll get back to you.

40:30.040 --> 40:32.800
- " Mr Novick's office."
- Let me speak to Novick.

40:32.880 --> 40:34.640
Yes, sir. Right away.

40:34.720 --> 40:38.960
I solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute
the office of the president,

40:39.040 --> 40:41.440
and will, to the best of my ability,

40:41.520 --> 40:46.960
preserve, protect and defend
the constitution of the United States.

40:47.440 --> 40:49.600
Mr President, I appreciate it.

40:51.840 --> 40:54.560
I appreciate you coming.

40:54.640 --> 40:56.360
- As most of you know...
- Novick.

40:56.440 --> 40:58.320
Mike, it's Jack. We got a problem.

40:58.400 --> 41:02.440
...this oath under tragic circumstances.
Words cannot express the sense...

41:02.520 --> 41:05.040
The football's been compromised.

41:05.120 --> 41:07.240
Yes, I'll tell him.

41:07.320 --> 41:12.040
...due to injuries sustained during the crash.
He is in our prayers, as well as our hearts.

41:12.120 --> 41:13.760
Mr President.

41:13.840 --> 41:17.520
- I've just received a phone call from CTU.
- Yes?

41:17.600 --> 41:21.200
I'm sorry, sir, but it appears
at least part of the nuclear football

41:21.280 --> 41:24.240
has fallen into the hands of terrorists.

41:57.600 --> 42:00.760
