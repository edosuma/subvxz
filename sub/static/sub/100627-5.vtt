WEBVTT

00:11.250 --> 00:13.458
-Dad.
-Yes, I'll tell him now.

00:13.875 --> 00:16.291
Of course, now when he... I don't know.

00:16.375 --> 00:18.916
OK. Dad, here he comes.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.833
Here he comes.

00:23.250 --> 00:27.833
Professor, would you like some coffee?

00:28.750 --> 00:31.166
Well... yes, that'd be great, thank you.

00:32.041 --> 00:32.916
Good morning.

00:37.625 --> 00:39.000
Here is your coffee.

00:39.083 --> 00:40.291
And some cookies?

00:40.416 --> 00:42.833
Yes... thank you.

00:48.166 --> 00:49.791
What is it?

00:52.500 --> 00:53.500
Let's see.

00:54.291 --> 00:55.541
-Just one thing.
-Yes.

00:55.625 --> 00:58.000
A small matter.

00:59.166 --> 01:01.666
-Do you have any siblings?
-Moscow, please.

01:01.750 --> 01:04.750
No personal questions.
It's one of the first rules.

01:04.833 --> 01:08.333
I have a friend
who's practically a brother to me.

01:08.416 --> 01:11.791
He was with me in the mine,
on robberies, and in prison.

01:11.875 --> 01:13.166
That's the problem.

01:13.250 --> 01:16.375
I got let out,
but he still has five years left.

01:16.458 --> 01:17.791
Five years, Professor.

01:17.875 --> 01:21.958
Yes, well, sorry,
but I don't see what I can do for your...

01:22.416 --> 01:24.333
friend, brother, or whoever.

01:24.416 --> 01:25.958
No, his son.

01:26.041 --> 01:28.291
-His son?
-Yes, Juanito. My godson.

01:28.375 --> 01:30.291
And he's like a brother to me.

01:30.375 --> 01:33.708
I promised I'd look after him
when I got out of prison.

01:33.791 --> 01:37.833
We haven't seen him for a while,
and we've heard he's not doing well.

01:37.916 --> 01:40.458
He's out of work, almost destitute.

01:40.541 --> 01:44.291
I thought I could get him back on track
and bring him here.

01:44.375 --> 01:48.500
-Being in a heist is back on track?
-Well, this is a respectable heist.

01:49.208 --> 01:53.291
Just look at this guy.
I've never seen him so focused in my life.

01:53.375 --> 01:56.750
If it goes well,
there'll be plenty to go around, right?

01:56.833 --> 01:58.666
-I'm sorry but--
-Professor.

01:58.750 --> 02:01.833
The guy's awesome.
I've known him since we were kids.

02:01.916 --> 02:03.708
He's a pro at everything:

02:03.791 --> 02:05.250
cars, break-ins...

02:05.333 --> 02:09.541
Why do we call you Denver and you Moscow?
And him Helsinki? For safety.

02:09.625 --> 02:12.958
No one can know each other's names.
We can't--

02:13.041 --> 02:14.291
-Yeah.
-Let's see.

02:14.375 --> 02:17.458
I made an exception for your son.
Now your godson?

02:17.541 --> 02:21.250
This isn't a family business.
We can't take on every cousin--

02:21.333 --> 02:23.000
What are you saying, loser?

02:23.083 --> 02:24.583
-Sorry?
-He's the Professor.

02:24.666 --> 02:27.833
We're talking about a kid
who's almost destitute, Dad.

02:27.916 --> 02:30.083
We're saying we'd trust him
with our lives,

02:30.166 --> 02:32.583
and he comes out with
that shit about city names!

02:32.666 --> 02:35.875
Do you know what you can do
with the name "Denver"?

02:35.958 --> 02:38.916
You can stick it up your ass.
My name is Dani, Dad.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.333
I'm Dani, always have been. Also:

02:41.416 --> 02:44.375
your infallible plan for the Royal Mint

02:44.458 --> 02:47.208
is really fucking shit.

02:47.291 --> 02:50.416
Print the bills at a print shop.
It'll be cheaper.

02:51.291 --> 02:52.875
Thank you for the coffee.

02:57.458 --> 03:01.250
That better be the last time
you speak to him like that.

03:01.333 --> 03:04.958
I'm ashamed of you.
Can't you see he's an intellectual?

03:06.166 --> 03:07.916
Well, to each their own.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.583
You have to trust that man
and respect him.

03:11.666 --> 03:13.291
-Don't I respect him?
-No.

03:13.833 --> 03:16.958
No, maybe the kid's right.

03:17.333 --> 03:20.708
If we print them at home,
we'd save ourselves a lot of trouble.

03:20.791 --> 03:23.041
And the cost of weapons...

03:23.458 --> 03:24.625
of ammunition...

03:26.208 --> 03:30.416
Denver, you bring the printer,
we'll download the bills on the internet.

03:31.916 --> 03:35.125
A stroke of genius. No, even better...

03:35.583 --> 03:38.375
I draw the bills, and you color them.

03:39.416 --> 03:41.291
Perhaps we can make two a day.

03:41.958 --> 03:44.708
Look how good I am at drawing.

03:46.583 --> 03:48.916
It's called "Passion for Juanito."

03:50.041 --> 03:51.833
Are you gonna keep this up?

03:51.916 --> 03:56.166
Maybe I'll start throwing punches,
and you'll be printing new teeth.

03:56.250 --> 03:57.541
Fuck off.

03:57.625 --> 04:00.166
Denver, don't get mad. It's a joke.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.875
<i>I woke up in lockdown within our lockdown.</i>

04:13.125 --> 04:16.250
<i>In chains, dazed,</i>
<i>and with a madman in front of me.</i>

04:16.791 --> 04:20.166
<i>I'd lost my freedom,</i>
<i>and I was running out of time.</i>

04:21.000 --> 04:24.041
<i>Within only 15 minutes</i>
<i>of me opening my eyes,</i>

04:24.375 --> 04:26.958
<i>Gandía would've already shot</i>
<i>at most of us.</i>

04:32.500 --> 04:34.375
What are you doing?

04:34.458 --> 04:36.458
I won't hit you
because you're tied up.

04:36.541 --> 04:38.000
Let me go.

04:38.416 --> 04:40.541
Then we'll see who's punching who.

04:48.791 --> 04:50.166
Why didn't you kill me?

04:50.875 --> 04:53.708
-I'm no murderer.
-You're not a murderer?

04:54.500 --> 04:58.083
You tried to kill Nairobi and Helsinki,
and you're not a murderer?

05:00.541 --> 05:02.708
Why didn't you kill me?

05:04.208 --> 05:05.500
You're my guinea pig.

05:06.250 --> 05:07.166
And you?

05:10.500 --> 05:12.291
What the hell are you?

05:13.000 --> 05:14.708
I'm the tamer.

05:15.166 --> 05:17.166
And you're lucky.

05:18.125 --> 05:20.083
I'm going to tame you.

05:28.333 --> 05:31.041
The next time you kick me,
I'll beat you so hard,

05:31.125 --> 05:33.625
your crippled friend
won't recognize you.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.708
Keep still.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.333
Listen to me. I'll explain.

05:42.416 --> 05:44.000
It's very easy.

05:46.750 --> 05:47.833
Son of a bitch.

05:48.250 --> 05:49.083
Look.

05:51.583 --> 05:53.541
My first card is you:

05:54.958 --> 05:55.875
missing.

05:56.750 --> 06:02.166
They have no choice but to look for you.
And they're going about it like maniacs.

06:05.208 --> 06:08.875
Divided and nervous. I'm already winning.

06:10.750 --> 06:12.458
The next card:

06:13.500 --> 06:14.583
break up the team.

06:15.291 --> 06:17.166
Didn't you wonder how I escaped?

06:24.541 --> 06:25.625
This is Gandía,

06:25.708 --> 06:28.333
<i>head of security at the Bank of Spain.</i>

06:28.416 --> 06:29.791
<i>I'm hidden,</i>

06:29.875 --> 06:33.666
<i>safe and sound,</i>
<i>and ready to undertake any action</i>

06:33.750 --> 06:35.833
<i>that may be necessary to regain</i>

06:35.916 --> 06:38.916
-control and safety--
<i>-</i>He wants to kill us one by one!

06:39.000 --> 06:40.916
<i>Stay together. He's watching!</i>

06:41.625 --> 06:44.791
As you've just heard,
I'm in wonderful company.

07:52.041 --> 07:54.208
You need to start behaving better.

07:54.583 --> 07:57.750
Otherwise, you'll end up immobilized,

07:58.375 --> 08:02.250
tied up, gagged, and blindfolded.

08:03.333 --> 08:07.958
Then we won't be able to
get to know each other, OK?

08:15.208 --> 08:17.916
I just wanted to thank Palermo.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.916
<i>His tip on escaping from my handcuffs</i>
<i>by dislocating my thumb</i>

08:22.000 --> 08:23.708
<i>made me a free man.</i>

08:23.791 --> 08:26.666
<i>Thanks to him,</i>
<i>I hope to be able to help you.</i>

08:26.750 --> 08:28.166
And all hell breaks loose...

08:33.541 --> 08:34.583
Is that true?

08:34.666 --> 08:38.833
If you prefer to believe a psychopath
over one of us, that's up to you.

08:39.458 --> 08:42.541
Silence. You can speak at your trial,
son of a bitch.

08:57.416 --> 08:59.583
-I need to use the bathroom.
-Later.

08:59.666 --> 09:00.916
I'm telling you...

09:02.875 --> 09:04.791
my stomach doesn't feel good.

09:05.375 --> 09:07.625
I need to go to the bathroom urgently.

09:17.916 --> 09:18.750
What's wrong?

09:18.833 --> 09:20.458
The museum is big.

09:22.958 --> 09:26.375
And 60, 70 hostages
are difficult to manage.

09:26.458 --> 09:29.000
The tiniest spark
could ignite a rebellion.

09:30.208 --> 09:31.041
No.

09:31.625 --> 09:35.500
That would be suicide. In these cases,
survival instinct prevails.

09:36.791 --> 09:38.833
Or not. Fear.

09:39.583 --> 09:41.916
Fear and more fear.
They could do anything.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
Like setting upon one of us
even though we have M16s.

09:48.708 --> 09:51.250
-What have you got in mind?
-An infiltrator.

09:52.625 --> 09:56.666
They wouldn't have any contact with us
unless there's a rebellion.

09:56.750 --> 10:00.166
If there are no problems,
they'll leave with the hostages.

10:00.375 --> 10:04.166
It's a job the smoking monkey
from the Ringling Circus could do.

10:06.375 --> 10:08.583
And this Juanito guy could do it.

10:17.083 --> 10:18.250
Here it comes.

10:35.666 --> 10:36.541
Is that him?

10:37.208 --> 10:38.041
-No.
-No.

10:39.083 --> 10:41.125
-Well, that was his bus.
-I know.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.875
It's a bad start. Let's go.

10:42.958 --> 10:45.625
No, Professor. Maybe he just got confused.

10:45.708 --> 10:47.500
Or got off at the wrong stop.

10:47.583 --> 10:49.208
Yeah, the wrong stop.

10:49.291 --> 10:51.583
-And he's there--
-He got confused?

10:56.250 --> 10:57.250
Godfather.

11:04.500 --> 11:05.416
My God.

11:06.083 --> 11:06.958
It's me.

11:08.458 --> 11:09.291
Juanito?

11:11.125 --> 11:11.958
Julia.

11:13.125 --> 11:15.166
It's been too long, hasn't it?

11:17.166 --> 11:19.041
You look stunning, my girl.

11:20.000 --> 11:20.875
Well...

11:21.833 --> 11:24.333
you've always been handsome. Pretty.

11:25.125 --> 11:26.083
Those eyes...

11:26.166 --> 11:27.958
that mouth, that smile...

11:28.041 --> 11:29.916
You're beautiful, Julia.

11:37.666 --> 11:39.666
What's wrong, Daniel?

11:40.875 --> 11:42.208
Is this weird for you?

11:42.291 --> 11:46.666
No. Not at all.
I... I think it's fucking great.

11:47.208 --> 11:51.458
Everyone is free to do
whatever they want with whatever.

11:52.291 --> 11:53.333
So?

11:53.625 --> 11:57.500
Well, I look you in the eyes,
and you're still Juanito, but...

11:58.750 --> 12:00.041
you look so hot!

12:01.708 --> 12:03.958
-Come here, give me a hug.
-Wow.

12:07.666 --> 12:09.291
Hey, does your father know?

12:09.375 --> 12:12.166
I saw him a year ago,
and he didn't mention it.

12:12.750 --> 12:14.583
My father wholly supports me.

12:14.666 --> 12:17.583
He says he always wanted a daughter.
He's sweet.

12:19.666 --> 12:20.500
Who's this?

12:23.083 --> 12:24.583
The guy behind the job?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.166
That's right.

12:31.583 --> 12:33.541
And what does the job involve?

12:33.875 --> 12:36.625
Gandía's telling the truth.
Palermo helped him.

12:36.708 --> 12:39.958
-How do you know?
-I saw him pointing at his thumb.

12:40.041 --> 12:42.708
They were talking.
Palermo kept going over.

12:42.791 --> 12:43.750
Why didn't you say?

12:43.833 --> 12:47.208
I couldn't hear. I didn't know
he'd tell him to break his thumb.

12:47.291 --> 12:49.041
Get closer. You're not tied up.

12:49.125 --> 12:52.750
No, I'm here to watch the hostages,
not to watch you guys.

12:58.875 --> 13:01.791
-You hear a lot of shit in here.
-I know.

13:03.000 --> 13:03.958
How is Nairobi?

13:04.041 --> 13:06.791
She's recovering as best she can.

13:07.916 --> 13:10.125
With Tokyo captured, that's two down.

13:10.916 --> 13:13.625
We're starting to look a bit screwed,
right?

13:13.791 --> 13:16.250
Julia. What do you want?

13:17.666 --> 13:20.541
Let me go. Give me a gun.
Let me join the others.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.833
My butt's going numb from sitting.

13:22.916 --> 13:25.416
They need to think you're a hostage
in case it gets bad.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.208
-Worse than this?
-Just go back to your place.

13:28.291 --> 13:31.458
Matías is down there
with a gun he can barely hold.

13:31.541 --> 13:33.333
No, orders are orders.

13:33.416 --> 13:38.000
-You have to go back to your place.
-You give the orders. You're in charge.

13:38.083 --> 13:40.416
-I'm not in charge.
-Of course you are.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.666
Nairobi was shot,
Tokyo's been captured,

13:42.750 --> 13:46.875
Palermo... How can we trust him?
Think about it. You're next in line.

13:46.958 --> 13:49.041
-No one else.
-You're stressing me out.

13:50.666 --> 13:52.333
Start giving orders.

13:52.416 --> 13:55.166
Give me a gun,
a bulletproof vest, whatever.

13:55.583 --> 14:00.208
And... call me Manila,
because I'm Manila, Dani.

14:00.291 --> 14:03.250
You're not Manila yet.
You're still a hostage.

14:03.333 --> 14:06.666
And don't call me Dani. My name is Denver.
Let's go.

14:07.541 --> 14:09.250
And another thing:

14:09.416 --> 14:12.750
don't stare at me.
People are starting to notice.

14:12.833 --> 14:13.916
Stare?

14:14.541 --> 14:16.791
I was sending you signals, you idiot.

14:16.875 --> 14:17.875
"Intently."

14:26.750 --> 14:28.458
It's a fucking sauna in here.

14:30.125 --> 14:31.333
Turn the AC on.

14:31.416 --> 14:33.541
If I turn it on, they'll find us.

14:33.625 --> 14:35.083
That would be a shame.

14:35.166 --> 14:38.541
Of course. We have so much to talk about.

14:39.750 --> 14:42.125
Without the AC, there's not much oxygen,

14:42.250 --> 14:44.791
so you should ration your breathing.

14:46.833 --> 14:48.666
Don't you worry about me.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.375
They've broken into
the vault of the national reserve.

14:53.458 --> 14:56.333
What do you think they'll do
to your shitty bunker?

14:57.416 --> 14:58.833
You're dead.

14:59.333 --> 15:03.583
You're sweaty. Shall I open your jumpsuit?
We can't have poor hygiene--

15:03.666 --> 15:06.208
Touch me, and I'll rip your arm off.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.833
Hey, what happened with that boy?

15:11.291 --> 15:14.791
The one with curly hair.
He doesn't turn you on anymore?

15:18.583 --> 15:19.708
Like crazy.

15:19.791 --> 15:23.041
I don't think so.
For you, kids and IT guys...

15:27.083 --> 15:28.916
I set up this heist for him.

15:30.625 --> 15:35.583
What's the most someone's done for you?
Given you a drill on Father's Day?

15:35.666 --> 15:37.583
Real men are more your type.

15:38.875 --> 15:40.416
-Like you.
-Like me.

15:40.500 --> 15:41.333
Of course.

15:41.416 --> 15:43.250
You've even stopped kicking me.

15:43.708 --> 15:46.416
Because you tied my legs,
you fucking idiot.

15:46.500 --> 15:50.750
Well, whatever the reason...
the main thing is, you're more receptive.

15:53.541 --> 15:55.875
And your toenails are painted.

15:57.416 --> 15:58.541
I love it.

16:00.791 --> 16:02.916
<i>Is it true you helped Gandía escape?</i>

16:03.000 --> 16:03.875
Yes, sir.

16:04.291 --> 16:07.833
<i>Are you aware he almost killed</i>
<i>Nairobi and Helsinki?</i>

16:07.916 --> 16:09.041
Collateral damage.

16:09.125 --> 16:12.208
-Collateral damage? Bastard!
-Take it easy.

16:12.291 --> 16:14.041
Why did you do it, Palermo?

16:14.125 --> 16:16.291
<i>Tokyo staged a coup, sir.</i>

16:16.958 --> 16:18.750
I felt morally obligated

16:19.750 --> 16:22.916
to save the plan.
That's where my loyalty lies.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.708
I had to restore the established order,
because you never relieved me of my post.

16:27.791 --> 16:29.125
<i>I did it de facto.</i>

16:29.250 --> 16:32.250
Besides, that has nothing to do with
freeing Gandía.

16:32.333 --> 16:33.208
<i>It does.</i>

16:33.291 --> 16:36.500
I had to create chaos.
It was clear he'd target her.

16:36.583 --> 16:38.541
He could have killed her.

16:39.166 --> 16:42.083
-I repeat, she staged a coup, sir.
-It's all lies!

16:42.166 --> 16:45.916
He was going to escape like a rat!
He had the state secrets.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.833
The kid is mistaken.

16:48.166 --> 16:50.833
I stopped you at the door,
with the briefcase.

16:51.541 --> 16:53.458
You were gonna negotiate, jerk.

16:53.541 --> 16:57.041
That so? With the documents I stole?
The briefcase is there.

16:57.125 --> 16:59.791
-Why don't you have a look?
-Denver, open it.

17:05.583 --> 17:06.666
What's inside?

17:08.166 --> 17:09.166
Muffins.

17:13.208 --> 17:16.500
Whatever's in the briefcase,
it makes no difference.

17:17.791 --> 17:20.458
<i>You betrayed the gang.</i>

17:20.541 --> 17:22.208
You put everyone in danger,

17:22.291 --> 17:25.208
and thanks to you,
Gandía has my commanding officer.

17:26.500 --> 17:29.833
Listen, I'm going to give you
one chance to make amends.

17:31.083 --> 17:35.333
But I won't forget what you did.
And of course, you won't be in charge.

17:36.541 --> 17:39.666
So I go back to the lobby
with the hostages? What do I do?

17:39.750 --> 17:41.166
First of all, shut up.

17:42.500 --> 17:45.500
And no, you won't go back there.
Release him.

17:47.916 --> 17:50.000
With a killer here, we can't be divided.

17:50.083 --> 17:51.583
<i>When all this is over,</i>

17:52.208 --> 17:54.083
then we'll decide his sentence.

18:22.583 --> 18:24.125
<i>Now, listen closely.</i>

18:25.125 --> 18:26.750
<i>With a lone wolf out there,</i>

18:27.250 --> 18:31.041
the most vulnerable place is the lobby.
We need to evacuate it.

18:31.125 --> 18:34.666
Palermo, Stockholm, Helsinki,
get the hostages to the library.

18:34.750 --> 18:38.083
He wants to kill you, not escape.
The door doesn't matter.

18:38.166 --> 18:39.541
Do not wear your masks.

18:39.625 --> 18:42.166
He could do the same,
and he would blend in.

18:43.083 --> 18:45.916
Bogotá, what's the situation
in the foundry?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.083
The furnaces are off. They're scared.

18:48.583 --> 18:52.666
Take Nairobi to the library, then go down.
The foundry cannot be idle.

18:53.708 --> 18:54.541
Denver.

18:54.625 --> 18:57.791
-Yes.
<i>-You and Rio will act. Begin the hunt.</i>

18:58.416 --> 19:01.416
<i>You will be the most exposed.</i>
<i>Equip yourselves well.</i>

19:01.500 --> 19:04.125
Helmets, ammunition, magazines.
Everything you need.

19:04.208 --> 19:07.458
Sweep the first floor.
Once you finish a room, seal it.

19:07.541 --> 19:08.833
And the other floors?

19:08.916 --> 19:12.541
<i>Helsinki and Stockholm will do them</i>
<i>once hostages are in the library.</i>

19:14.583 --> 19:16.208
Everyone know what to do?

19:16.291 --> 19:18.500
-Yes, sir.
-Yes.

19:19.916 --> 19:20.833
One more thing.

19:23.250 --> 19:24.125
Good luck.

19:26.041 --> 19:27.166
Be very careful.

19:27.750 --> 19:28.583
Let's go!

19:40.416 --> 19:42.791
-How are you feeling, little one?
-Fine.

19:43.333 --> 19:44.791
I have a good nurse.

19:48.458 --> 19:50.000
You like the big guy, huh?

19:51.166 --> 19:52.208
Maybe.

19:53.750 --> 19:54.583
Hang in there.

19:56.250 --> 19:57.250
You too.

20:06.041 --> 20:09.000
Wow, that woman is so drunk, Helsinki.

20:09.083 --> 20:13.208
Do you know what she said? She said,
"What a hunk you've got yourself."

20:13.708 --> 20:17.166
She means you.
Everyone thinks we're husband and wife.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.708
Better. That way, no one notices us.

20:20.041 --> 20:23.250
It's not better.
Neither of us will get any action.

20:23.333 --> 20:25.708
Never mind action, Nairobi. Cheers.

20:28.333 --> 20:32.625
A day or two is OK, but at this rate,
we'll become virgins again.

20:33.916 --> 20:37.833
Truth is, you and I
make an excellent couple.

20:41.333 --> 20:42.291
You and I?

20:42.375 --> 20:44.166
We're family, that's for sure.

20:44.791 --> 20:45.791
Forever.

20:47.083 --> 20:48.250
Well, that's why.

20:48.625 --> 20:51.666
I've been through more with you
than with anyone.

20:52.375 --> 20:53.916
This, Helsi...

20:55.666 --> 20:57.375
is a love story.

20:57.958 --> 21:00.500
One of those beautiful love stories.

21:03.500 --> 21:07.291
No. Someday someone will show up,

21:08.291 --> 21:09.625
and that will be love.

21:10.875 --> 21:11.916
But this isn't.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.083
You have to be free and brave.

21:15.333 --> 21:19.916
Because believe me,
you need more courage for love...

21:21.750 --> 21:23.208
than for war.

21:23.291 --> 21:24.166
And you...

21:25.541 --> 21:26.708
you're brave.

21:29.958 --> 21:30.916
Put it on.

21:34.125 --> 21:35.750
We're going to the foundry.

21:37.583 --> 21:39.208
We're going to the library.

21:40.125 --> 21:41.375
Those are the orders.

21:42.500 --> 21:43.541
Bogotá.

21:48.583 --> 21:49.708
Don't fuck with me.

21:50.458 --> 21:51.791
They're scared, right?

21:51.875 --> 21:54.791
If so, they won't last 5 minutes
against Gandía.

21:55.916 --> 21:57.333
I need to speak to them.

21:59.250 --> 22:01.041
When did you eat last?

22:05.208 --> 22:06.125
Two days ago.

22:08.666 --> 22:11.166
-Maybe three.
-And the last time you slept?

22:15.166 --> 22:18.958
I've slept twice since I arrived,
two hours each time. Anything else?

22:24.541 --> 22:27.250
Before you eat,
I'm going to clean that wound.

22:48.875 --> 22:49.958
Stay still.

22:51.833 --> 22:53.541
Your hair is all stuck in it.

22:55.375 --> 22:56.875
I hit you hard, didn't I?

23:04.708 --> 23:06.666
-<i>Library clear.</i>
-Copy that.

23:08.125 --> 23:10.750
Everyone on your feet
and into four lines.

23:10.833 --> 23:12.666
Dear hostages...

23:14.000 --> 23:14.958
I am back.

23:16.125 --> 23:19.500
As you know, a wolf's on the loose,
and you are the lambs.

23:19.583 --> 23:22.416
So we're taking you into the barn.

23:22.500 --> 23:25.583
You will be escorted
by my colleagues and shepherds:

23:25.666 --> 23:27.083
Helsinki and Stockholm.

23:27.708 --> 23:29.500
Let's go, now, quickly!

23:29.583 --> 23:31.708
Everyone up! Come on!

23:34.666 --> 23:35.958
Stay here with me.

23:36.041 --> 23:38.625
You're my best shield against Gandía.

23:38.708 --> 23:40.041
That's it, quickly.

23:45.875 --> 23:47.625
<i>Here. This works wonders.</i>

23:49.041 --> 23:50.875
<i>It's not too strong, is it?</i>

23:50.958 --> 23:52.000
Amanda, right?

23:53.083 --> 23:54.916
-Yes.
-Are you OK?

23:57.500 --> 23:58.666
Yes.

23:58.750 --> 23:59.958
Are you sure?

24:00.958 --> 24:02.041
Well...

24:02.625 --> 24:04.083
I'm a bit dizzy.

24:04.541 --> 24:07.333
It must have been
those pills Mr. Román gave me.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.500
Hello, how are you?

24:19.166 --> 24:20.000
Fine.

24:20.541 --> 24:21.583
I'm Arturo.

24:22.583 --> 24:23.458
Arturo Román.

24:24.375 --> 24:26.250
You looked very tense before,

24:26.333 --> 24:29.041
asking to go to the bathroom.
I was worried.

24:29.833 --> 24:32.416
It's my nerves. It's tough being in here.

24:32.500 --> 24:36.875
With these terrorists,
it'd be tough anywhere. I know.

24:39.458 --> 24:41.833
It was just some anxiety.
I'm OK. Thanks.

24:41.916 --> 24:45.083
We only have each other.
We have to stick together.

24:45.791 --> 24:46.750
Trust me.

24:47.625 --> 24:48.458
Yeah.

24:53.083 --> 24:55.541
If you feel anxious again,

24:56.708 --> 24:58.916
I've got something that might help.

24:59.500 --> 25:01.458
Oh, really? What is it?

25:04.208 --> 25:05.791
Veteran's privileges.

25:07.625 --> 25:08.791
That's everyone.

25:08.875 --> 25:12.500
We've brought you to the library because,
as the saying goes,

25:12.583 --> 25:14.375
knowledge takes up no space.

25:14.833 --> 25:17.375
In this case,
it could also save your lives.

25:17.458 --> 25:20.833
<i>In Search of Lost Time,</i>
for example, by Marcel Proust.

25:21.125 --> 25:24.291
Terrific. Beautiful novel. I'm certain...

25:24.708 --> 25:26.041
that whoever finds it

25:26.583 --> 25:29.000
and hugs it to their chest

25:29.708 --> 25:32.250
will be able to deflect bullets
from an M16.

25:34.750 --> 25:37.791
It's a joke. Relax.

25:38.791 --> 25:41.000
We'll be in here for a long time.

25:41.250 --> 25:43.625
These are the rules. Number one--

25:46.375 --> 25:48.458
Bogotá, Nairobi, where are you?

25:50.416 --> 25:53.416
5:00 MINUTES EARLIER

25:54.666 --> 25:56.083
Don't move!

25:56.166 --> 25:59.250
Are you all stupid or what?
Lower your weapons.

26:11.333 --> 26:12.541
Are you scared?

26:12.625 --> 26:16.125
There's a madman on the loose
who's armed to the teeth.

26:17.458 --> 26:18.666
I'm scared too.

26:19.416 --> 26:22.250
-Bogotá, are you scared?
-As much as anyone else.

26:25.625 --> 26:28.875
Palermo, Helsinki, and Stockholm
are scared as well.

26:31.291 --> 26:33.666
But they're taking hostages
to the library.

26:35.125 --> 26:39.791
Denver and Rio are really damn scared.

26:42.250 --> 26:44.000
Because they're after Gandía.

26:44.833 --> 26:45.916
And Gandía...

26:46.416 --> 26:49.791
is the most scared,
but he won't stop until he kills us.

26:50.333 --> 26:51.541
That's fine with me.

26:52.583 --> 26:53.583
"That's fine."

27:06.666 --> 27:08.833
Everyone's doing their jobs.

27:10.166 --> 27:13.250
And here you are, scared shitless.

27:14.125 --> 27:15.833
Hiding in a makeshift trench.

27:15.916 --> 27:18.708
-We didn't come here to shoot people.
-I know.

27:21.375 --> 27:25.291
But there's no choice.
This is the easiest place to defend.

27:25.916 --> 27:27.708
That's the only way in,

27:28.750 --> 27:31.625
and from here,
any one of us could mow him down.

27:32.583 --> 27:34.916
But what do you see when you enter?

27:36.416 --> 27:38.958
The chicken squadron peering out.

27:40.541 --> 27:43.708
I don't recognize you.

27:45.541 --> 27:47.541
You are workers.

27:48.750 --> 27:50.041
You are welders.

27:50.958 --> 27:53.750
The toughest guys
I've ever met in my life.

27:53.833 --> 27:54.958
My golden boys.

27:56.166 --> 27:57.458
You're not chickens.

28:00.791 --> 28:03.125
You know what else is scary?

28:05.125 --> 28:07.041
Walking home alone at night.

28:09.041 --> 28:11.625
But us women keep doing it.

28:12.833 --> 28:16.458
Take fear by the hand and keep living.

28:18.833 --> 28:21.458
Because you have to live, gentlemen!

28:22.250 --> 28:24.041
You have to live to the end!

28:31.208 --> 28:32.583
Fuck, believe me.

28:33.333 --> 28:36.041
You made me come back from the dead
to nag you.

28:40.333 --> 28:44.291
What? Aren't you going to give me a hug?

28:50.541 --> 28:52.416
-How are you?
-I don't know.

28:52.500 --> 28:54.000
Pumped full of drugs.

28:54.083 --> 28:55.916
I'm not hearing any music.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.916
-Are we going to work unhappy?
-Music, dammit.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.541
Are we Latinos or Germans?

29:01.500 --> 29:03.416
Nice wheels. Is it a Harley?

29:03.500 --> 29:05.500
Don't start ribbing me now, hey?

29:05.583 --> 29:07.708
How many tons have we melted?

29:07.791 --> 29:09.208
Forty-three and a half.

29:09.791 --> 29:12.916
We need to step it up a gear.
I want the furnaces on.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
And two-hour shifts
to get the remaining ingots.

29:16.083 --> 29:17.916
Bring me a sample of the shot.

29:23.083 --> 29:23.958
Let's see.

29:28.583 --> 29:31.416
Turn up the gas pressure
by two kilopascals.

29:32.166 --> 29:34.166
The diameter's a bit big.

29:34.250 --> 29:36.916
I want to see you working like always...

29:37.000 --> 29:38.916
with rhythm, with joy.

29:55.791 --> 29:56.916
What's up with you?

30:00.958 --> 30:02.041
What do you mean?

30:03.083 --> 30:03.916
Nothing.

30:05.875 --> 30:08.875
I'll have to say
that ten-foot pole thing again.

30:09.541 --> 30:11.750
When I said that, at least...

30:12.916 --> 30:14.125
you flirted with me.

30:14.708 --> 30:15.708
But now...

30:17.125 --> 30:18.666
it's like I've got typhus.

30:22.666 --> 30:24.791
I don't wanna take advantage.
You're hurt.

30:28.958 --> 30:29.791
Right.

30:30.666 --> 30:31.708
Well, OK.

30:32.791 --> 30:34.583
We'll wait until I'm better,

30:35.208 --> 30:38.041
until we get out of here,
we find my father,

30:38.125 --> 30:39.666
you ask him for my hand...

30:44.458 --> 30:47.291
If the fire's gone out, let me know.

31:12.541 --> 31:14.166
What sort of kiss was that?

31:18.041 --> 31:19.083
Help me up.

31:43.916 --> 31:44.916
Better down here.

31:45.833 --> 31:47.000
Yes.

31:51.833 --> 31:53.250
-Are you OK?
-Yes. You?

31:53.333 --> 31:54.833
-Yes.
<i>-Bogotá, Nairobi,</i>

31:54.916 --> 31:57.000
<i>-location?</i>
-Elevator. We're OK.

31:57.083 --> 31:58.458
And Denver and Rio?

31:59.708 --> 32:01.625
5:00 MINUTES EARLIER

32:05.750 --> 32:07.958
-Library clear.
<i>-Copy that.</i>

32:24.541 --> 32:26.375
About the Maserati thing...

32:26.458 --> 32:29.208
-What about it?
-I'd like to say something.

32:29.291 --> 32:31.541
Now? What do you want?

32:31.625 --> 32:35.125
Tokyo may be a Maserati,
but you're hanging off the back.

32:35.416 --> 32:37.208
Like cans on a wedding car.

32:37.291 --> 32:38.500
Yes.

32:38.583 --> 32:40.375
Rio.

32:41.083 --> 32:41.916
The office.

32:42.916 --> 32:43.833
Go.

33:03.125 --> 33:04.208
Do you like her?

33:04.291 --> 33:07.291
-What are you talking about?
-The fucking Maserati.

33:08.458 --> 33:11.083
If you wanna take her for a ride,
go ahead.

33:11.166 --> 33:13.458
Can you hear the crap you're saying?

33:19.416 --> 33:23.000
First of all, she feels,
thinks, and decides.

33:25.125 --> 33:28.125
The thing is,
she's messed up about the break-up.

33:29.208 --> 33:32.583
I'll tell you one thing.
Respect a friend's girlfriend.

33:32.666 --> 33:34.541
-Ex-girlfriend.
-Same thing.

33:34.625 --> 33:38.791
Ex or not, a friend's girlfriend
is like a radioactive town.

33:38.875 --> 33:42.500
Even after 20,000 years,
it's still contaminated land.

33:42.583 --> 33:45.541
You don't go there,
even with the ex's permission.

33:45.625 --> 33:47.625
-That's stupid.
-No, it's ethics.

33:47.708 --> 33:49.541
The most sacred kind of ethics.

33:49.916 --> 33:52.625
What were you doing
on the sofa with Stockholm?

33:53.541 --> 33:54.583
We were talking.

33:56.166 --> 33:58.333
Barefoot? Come on, man.

33:58.708 --> 34:02.916
-Well, yes, barefoot. What does it matter?
-It does matter, Rio.

34:03.000 --> 34:06.041
I don't talk to Lisbon
barefoot on the sofa.

34:06.125 --> 34:10.125
It would be fucking weird.
I'd feel uncomfortable. Do you know why?

34:10.208 --> 34:12.208
That's the Professor's territory.

34:14.500 --> 34:17.833
There's your boyfriend.
Want to say anything to him?

34:17.916 --> 34:19.166
Rio! Rio, isn't it?

34:20.000 --> 34:22.333
Rio! Denver!

34:22.416 --> 34:24.625
Help me, please!

34:24.708 --> 34:31.291
I'm trapped! Friends from the gang, help!

34:37.416 --> 34:41.083
That's what 70 centimeters
of reinforced concrete does.

34:41.791 --> 34:45.416
It's like shouting in a submarine
at the bottom of the sea.

34:54.083 --> 34:55.291
Third card:

34:56.500 --> 34:57.583
to draw blood.

35:01.083 --> 35:02.750
I'm going out for a moment.

35:14.625 --> 35:17.625
I was telling her I have PTSD, asshole.

35:17.708 --> 35:19.875
I wasn't stealing your girlfriend.

35:19.958 --> 35:24.041
-Talking to her calms me down.
-Talking to Stockholm calms you down?

35:24.125 --> 35:24.958
Well, yes.

35:25.791 --> 35:31.208
She is smart, nice, and she listens.
She empathizes. You can tell her anything.

35:31.291 --> 35:34.833
You can tell me anything too,
but you don't want to.

35:44.375 --> 35:46.541
I haven't been able to sleep.

35:47.500 --> 35:50.583
Whenever I closed my eyes,
I had nightmares, anxiety,

35:50.666 --> 35:52.625
palpitations, attacks, dude.

35:53.750 --> 35:57.000
I've only been able to sleep
knowing she was by my side.

35:57.958 --> 35:59.791
Do you know what I mean?

36:01.958 --> 36:04.583
You sleep with her
and tell me to my face.

36:05.583 --> 36:10.458
I haven't slept with her, Denver.
She was just keeping me company.

36:15.375 --> 36:17.375
Are you my friend or not, damn it?

36:19.708 --> 36:22.541
-I'm your friend.
-Doesn't seem like it.

36:27.166 --> 36:28.625
Jesus fucking Christ!

36:29.791 --> 36:32.458
Your helmet! Your vest!

36:32.541 --> 36:34.041
Put pressure on it!

36:34.916 --> 36:36.208
Denver, hold on!

36:44.583 --> 36:47.083
-Bogotá, Nairobi, location?
<i>-Elevator.</i>

36:47.166 --> 36:49.291
We're OK. And Denver and Rio?

36:49.666 --> 36:50.875
Denver, Rio.

36:52.166 --> 36:53.916
-Denver, Rio.
-I'll go.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.166
No, you stay with the hostages.

36:56.250 --> 36:57.916
Come on, Helsinki.

37:10.125 --> 37:12.416
Careful, the bastard's here somewhere.

37:25.125 --> 37:27.791
It was in the elevator
on the first floor.

37:27.875 --> 37:28.958
Received.

37:30.083 --> 37:32.708
He may be nearby. We'll stay here.

37:35.416 --> 37:36.583
Come on, big man.

37:54.125 --> 37:55.541
Stay calm. We're here!

37:58.625 --> 38:00.875
-Get up.
-Denver.

38:01.666 --> 38:03.083
Are you OK?

38:03.166 --> 38:04.583
Are you OK?

38:10.875 --> 38:11.833
Are you OK?

38:15.500 --> 38:17.416
Get down!

38:28.833 --> 38:30.500
Motherfucker!

38:34.458 --> 38:35.666
We're taking fire!

38:35.750 --> 38:38.375
First floor, elevator.
Reinforcements, now!

38:39.541 --> 38:40.500
Go.

38:44.541 --> 38:45.833
Go.

40:40.958 --> 40:43.666
Third time's the charm, mutt.
