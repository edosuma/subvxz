00:00.247 --> 00:03.464
If any of the creeps that I dated
killed Ben, I'm going to find out.

00:03.465 --> 00:05.272
Eye Candy? The name's Reese.

00:05.273 --> 00:07.414
Jake, this is my room mate Sophia.

00:07.415 --> 00:09.845
<i>I'm working with the Cyber
Crimes Unit to catch the killer.</i>

00:10.484 --> 00:12.644
I have no idea what she'll do
from one moment to the next.

00:12.645 --> 00:14.402
She's completely unreliable.

00:14.403 --> 00:16.149
How did you know where I live?

00:16.149 --> 00:18.626
Well, maybe I could, uh, cook
you dinner?

00:18.627 --> 00:20.328
Who just shows up with groceries?

00:20.329 --> 00:22.185
Is there a serial
killer in my house right now?

00:22.186 --> 00:23.157
Where's Reese?

00:23.158 --> 00:24.094
Disappeared.

00:24.914 --> 00:25.932
(Grunting)

00:25.933 --> 00:27.488
Reese isn't the killer.

00:27.489 --> 00:29.923
<i>- What do you want?
- He's his latest victim.</i>

00:37.140 --> 00:40.530
Reese Hennessey?
It's the NYPD.

01:41.943 --> 01:42.650
I don't know.

01:42.651 --> 01:44.099
What am I supposed to think?

01:44.100 --> 01:47.210
Pulling out someone's teeth sure
isn't a great character trait.

01:47.211 --> 01:48.639
He feels powerful, arrogant,

01:48.640 --> 01:51.037
but sometimes
it's not about power.

01:52.047 --> 01:55.141
Sometimes it's about the desire
to be understood.

01:55.847 --> 01:57.132
By who... me?

01:59.226 --> 02:00.831
Look, Reese gave me the creeps.

02:00.832 --> 02:04.932
He did, but he doesn't deserve
to die this way.

02:05.465 --> 02:07.036
It's my fault.

02:07.037 --> 02:08.308
No, it isn't.

02:08.309 --> 02:11.831
He targeted Reese and now
he's bragging about it

02:11.832 --> 02:13.095
because of me.

02:14.782 --> 02:16.424
That was the crime scene tech.

02:16.425 --> 02:18.067
The teeth we found aren't
Reese's.

02:18.068 --> 02:19.204
They belong to a woman.

02:19.683 --> 02:21.053
So Reese could still be alive?

02:21.054 --> 02:21.726
Yes.

02:21.727 --> 02:23.855
We need to find him.
Time is running out.

02:23.856 --> 02:26.618
Lindy, the NYPD is out, looking
for any sign of him right now.

02:26.619 --> 02:27.867
A sign? What kind of sign?

02:28.615 --> 02:30.604
Find out who those teeth
belong to now.

02:30.605 --> 02:31.425
Got it.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.330
New York's got a big database of
open homicides,

02:37.331 --> 02:38.977
but a victim with all her teeth pulled is

02:38.978 --> 02:41.638
what you call a very distinct
search criteria.

02:44.590 --> 02:46.126
Wow, there are so many of them.

02:49.334 --> 02:50.203
We got a match.

02:50.204 --> 02:53.087
Jane Doe... missing teeth,
couldn't ID her.

02:53.088 --> 02:54.976
Body was sent to Hart Island.

02:54.977 --> 02:56.858
- Hart Island?
- New York's Potter's field.

02:56.859 --> 02:58.480
It's where all unclaimed bodies
are sent.

02:58.481 --> 03:00.032
Here's her autopsy report now.

03:04.451 --> 03:05.848
I know her.

03:06.861 --> 03:08.274
It's Julia Becker.

03:14.812 --> 03:17.272
Julia's mother contacted me
because she said the police

03:17.273 --> 03:19.735
weren't doing anything to find
her after she reported it.

03:24.703 --> 03:26.999
Then why is there no missing
persons report on file?

03:33.139 --> 03:39.975
They're out there, waiting to
be seduced... billions of thirsty minds,

03:39.976 --> 03:45.011
craving hydration, aching
for you to give it to them.

03:45.012 --> 03:49.971
That's an extraordinary power, a
delicious responsibility.

03:50.467 --> 03:52.452
Now, when I look at our recent
page view numbers,

03:52.453 --> 03:56.745
I just feel so disheartened.

03:58.512 --> 04:03.903
"Nine Pet Vines that
Will Blow Your Mind."

04:03.904 --> 04:05.690
Which of you wrote that post?

04:12.100 --> 04:16.728
Did it blow your mind,
writing that story?

04:18.440 --> 04:20.579
What's gonna make it impossible

04:20.579 --> 04:22.469
for me not to click on it?

04:22.953 --> 04:26.710
Uh, at the time, I
thought it was fun.

04:26.711 --> 04:31.959
It's predictable. We can't afford
to do that here. Give me more.

04:34.936 --> 04:38.280
- Do you mean, like, right now?
- Well, if that's all you've got,

04:38.281 --> 04:41.625
I wouldn't be too optimistic
about your future here at Reconnoiter.

04:44.307 --> 04:47.211
I'm working on something.
I promise.

04:48.055 --> 04:52.122
Let's hope so.
Only promise what you can deliver.

05:05.566 --> 05:07.045
(Phones ringing and chatter)

05:33.399 --> 05:35.553
- Look, this isn't gonna be easy.
- I know.

05:35.554 --> 05:36.869
You sure about that?

05:40.744 --> 05:41.709
(Knocking)

05:44.467 --> 05:48.436
Susan? Hi, I'm Lindy Sampson.
I run the Never Forgotten Group website.

05:48.437 --> 05:50.024
We spoke about
your daughter Julia.

05:50.025 --> 05:51.556
Yes, of course.
Come in.

05:57.921 --> 05:59.642
Is there new information?

06:01.099 --> 06:03.488
Ms. Becker, I'm detective
Calligan with the NYPD.

06:03.489 --> 06:05.879
When was the last time
you heard from your daughter?

06:07.543 --> 06:10.998
I told the police when I
filled out the report. Not for weeks.

06:10.999 --> 06:12.429
You did fill out a report?

06:12.430 --> 06:14.984
Yes, of course. I thought
that's why you were here.

06:16.648 --> 06:19.276
Will one of you
please tell me what's going on?

06:19.811 --> 06:23.597
Ms. Becker, I'm so sorry.

06:26.911 --> 06:32.291

08:04.800 --> 08:06.473
- (Door closes)
- Sophia?

08:36.466 --> 08:39.214
You're home! So, how do you
feel about protective detail?

08:39.215 --> 08:42.900
I mean, I'm sure he's got great
abs, but do great abs save lives?

08:42.902 --> 08:43.804
Please don't sleep with him.

08:43.804 --> 08:46.240
Oh, sleeping was the
last thing on my mind.

08:46.241 --> 08:48.225
You said, no more cops.

08:48.226 --> 08:51.545
You have a good point, seeing as he
might be the only thing

08:51.546 --> 08:54.539
<i>standing between us and
tueur en série.</i>

08:54.540 --> 08:55.589
Serial killer?

08:55.590 --> 08:59.374
Mm, it's easier for me to emotionally
process when we don't use such crude words.

08:59.375 --> 09:03.897
So, I was thinking, how about we
just jump on a plane and be there?

09:03.898 --> 09:07.383
- You know, get out of town.
- Sophia.

09:07.384 --> 09:10.696
I know... I'm supposed to feel better
because the NYPD is protecting us, but...

09:10.697 --> 09:13.870
- Sophia.
- All I'm asking is, we have a plan, right?

09:14.451 --> 09:16.056
The NYPD is on it,

09:16.057 --> 09:20.744
the cyber crimes unit is on it, and
I'm on it. We're gonna catch him.

09:20.745 --> 09:23.283
And until then, we
keep living our lives.

09:23.284 --> 09:26.433
We're not not having a
life because of this freak.

09:28.570 --> 09:34.422
Okay. Okay. Tomorrow, you
and I... just the two of us... fat Friday.

09:35.278 --> 09:36.925
Come on, it's been forever.

09:36.926 --> 09:40.670
You can grab the Peking duck
world and kung pao from Floyd's,

09:40.671 --> 09:44.131
and I will get the bacon maple ice
cream from Industria.

09:44.132 --> 09:47.119
That actually
sounds really good.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.749
Damn right it does.

10:46.334 --> 10:47.943
- Any updates on Reese?
- No.

10:47.944 --> 10:49.249
What have we got?

10:49.746 --> 10:52.164
The photograph and envelope
came back clean. No fingerprints.

10:52.165 --> 10:55.771
The only parts he kept from Lindy's
original photo are Lindy and Sara's faces,

10:55.772 --> 10:58.046
and once we remove those,

10:58.752 --> 11:01.732
we're left with pieces of four other
separate photographs.

11:01.733 --> 11:04.199
These look like pieces
of crime scene photos.

11:04.200 --> 11:06.561
Search our database
of open homicides.

11:08.511 --> 11:11.872
But the faces are Sara's and mine.
Traditional photo recognition won't work.

11:11.873 --> 11:14.496
But there's another
program that uses a special algorithm

11:14.497 --> 11:18.512
to extrapolate the pixels in each
part of a photograph. It could work.

11:18.513 --> 11:19.546
Try it.

11:19.547 --> 11:23.401
- May I have a word?
- Yeah.

11:32.590 --> 11:38.024
Why did you choose this picture
for the home page of your computer?

11:38.025 --> 11:40.056
It's the last one
taken of us together.

11:40.057 --> 11:43.572
Was there anything
significant about that day?

11:44.810 --> 11:45.942
Not exactly.

11:47.531 --> 11:49.995
Lindy, whatever he
wants to tell you

11:49.996 --> 11:52.917
by sending you this picture
could help us find Reese.

11:52.918 --> 11:56.724
In the original picture,
your sister's wearing a bracelet,

11:56.725 --> 12:00.532
but in the replica, she's not.

12:01.463 --> 12:02.490
Why?

12:03.537 --> 12:06.388
- I didn't think anyone noticed.
- I did.

12:18.778 --> 12:22.498
It was, um... it
was Sara's birthday.

12:23.414 --> 12:25.350
I mean, once before she
disappeared.

12:25.351 --> 12:27.868
I gave it to her as a present,
and she loved it.

12:29.038 --> 12:32.776
Things had been rough after my mom died
and it was nice to see her smile again.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.748
A few days later, she lost it.

12:38.811 --> 12:43.090
I got really angry and I
yelled at her and I don't...

12:43.091 --> 12:44.250
I don't really understand why.

12:45.166 --> 12:52.551
But, um, I left for college
and we didn't talk until after that.

12:52.552 --> 12:54.166
It was... it was
never the same.

12:55.610 --> 12:59.105
- Who else knows this story?
- No one.

13:00.629 --> 13:02.230
Maybe my dad.

13:02.231 --> 13:04.111
Have you told him
about any of this?

13:04.112 --> 13:05.919
We're not close.

13:06.352 --> 13:08.659
I want you to know
that if you were my child,

13:08.660 --> 13:09.886
I'd tell you to leave the state.

13:09.887 --> 13:11.503
Well, I'm not your child.

13:12.482 --> 13:13.743
True.

13:14.078 --> 13:17.116
But, Lindy, we know
he's killed four people, maybe more.

13:17.417 --> 13:19.898
I asked you to consult on this
case, but I...

13:19.899 --> 13:23.091
No, no, no... he picked me. I don't
get to pick to leave.

13:23.092 --> 13:24.264
Not until we catch him.

13:26.261 --> 13:30.623
All right. But I want you
to stay away from Jake Bolin.

13:31.506 --> 13:33.105
I haven't heard
from him since our date.

13:33.106 --> 13:36.872
Keep it that way. Now that Reese
has been kidnapped, Jake's still a suspect.

13:36.873 --> 13:38.132
But he hasn't
done anything suspicious.

13:38.133 --> 13:40.568
I mean, the spyware on
his phone has tracked his every move,

13:40.569 --> 13:41.972
and we've been tailing him 24/7.

13:41.973 --> 13:43.351
That's why I still like him for this.

13:43.352 --> 13:46.053
Whoever this killer is knows
we're watching.

13:47.513 --> 13:49.187
There must be something else we
can do to find Reese.

13:49.188 --> 13:52.800
Very capable detectives from missing
persons are out, looking for him.

13:52.801 --> 13:53.685
We're doing all we can.

13:54.185 --> 13:56.544
- (Knocking on door)
- It worked.

14:02.737 --> 14:05.048
Three of the four component parts
in Lenny's photograph

14:05.049 --> 14:06.357
match with an open homicide.

14:06.358 --> 14:07.678
Take a look.

14:16.999 --> 14:18.371
You didn't find a match
for the background?

14:18.372 --> 14:19.610
No.

14:19.611 --> 14:21.650
It's not an accident
that he changed the background.

14:21.651 --> 14:22.679
None of this is an accident.

14:22.680 --> 14:23.834
Tell us about the victims.

14:24.591 --> 14:27.740
Michael Kelly. The
homicide is listed as a mob execution.

14:27.741 --> 14:29.695
He was shot, fingers cut off.

14:29.696 --> 14:31.315
Miranda McKenna was strangled.

14:31.316 --> 14:35.399
Breasts were removed. Her
boyfriend had a history of abuse.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.496
Homicide has also got
a case against him.

14:37.497 --> 14:39.149
And Anthony
Morgan... stabbing.

14:39.150 --> 14:41.643
Defensive wounds
showed that he put up a fight.

14:41.644 --> 14:42.913
Maybe that's why whoever robbed

14:42.914 --> 14:45.412
him gouged out his
eyes after they took his wallet.

14:45.413 --> 14:46.568
So, what's the connection?

14:46.569 --> 14:47.390
They've all been mutilated.

14:47.391 --> 14:51.008
Other than that, homicide reports list
different motives,

14:51.009 --> 14:52.428
different suspects
for each case.

14:54.272 --> 14:55.910
Guess what?

14:57.442 --> 15:01.406
They're all on Flirtual. Just like Julia
and Emily... he dated all of them.

15:01.407 --> 15:05.369
Oh, an equal opportunity serial killer.
At least he's got that going for him.

15:05.370 --> 15:07.855
He's claiming them, to boast.

15:07.856 --> 15:10.027
Get me everything on these
three homicides.

15:10.028 --> 15:11.968
I want these cases reopened.

15:15.642 --> 15:18.107
- How much stuff did you buy?
- Enough.

15:18.108 --> 15:20.489
And you're sure
this is a good idea?

15:20.490 --> 15:22.836
I'm not sure of anything right now,
Connor.

15:22.837 --> 15:24.023
See, that's what
I'm talking about.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.433
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

15:25.434 --> 15:29.807
I'm just saying that lately you've
lacked your usual sparkle.

15:30.103 --> 15:34.310
You're kidding, right? I'm sorry, but
my sparkle is under protective custody

15:34.310 --> 15:36.514
until Lindy
figures out her psycho situation.

15:36.515 --> 15:40.486
You mean, our psycho killer situation.
Our pictures were on that thing

15:40.486 --> 15:42.198
in the Cyber Crimes
Unit too, you know.

15:42.199 --> 15:43.161
Yes, but trying to make sense

15:43.162 --> 15:45.585
of that is much
more terrifying than the truth.

15:45.586 --> 15:47.222
Truth? What truth?

15:48.019 --> 15:49.668
♪ Bah bah bah bah ♪

15:49.669 --> 15:50.775
You're humming Beethoven's Fifth.

15:50.776 --> 15:52.686
You only do that
when you're trying not to gossip.

15:53.932 --> 15:55.152
You know you want to tell me.

15:57.923 --> 15:59.820
All right, look, but you are
sworn to secrecy.

15:59.821 --> 16:00.409
Okay.

16:00.410 --> 16:05.425
Secrecy, Connor. I... I...
I... I can't say it. Um, um...

16:20.096 --> 16:21.792
(Teakettle whistling)

16:32.120 --> 16:33.394
Uh-uh, don't look
at me.

16:33.395 --> 16:34.723
Didn't you bring Yaeger
coffee this morning?

16:34.724 --> 16:38.306
Well, yes, but I refuse to be
known as a refreshment handmaiden.

16:38.307 --> 16:41.587
Besides, drawing him
in is all about pressure and release.

16:41.588 --> 16:44.358
Pressure and release... ooh!

16:44.359 --> 16:46.973
Pressure and release.

16:47.430 --> 16:48.782
I'll take it to him, then.

16:48.783 --> 16:53.635
You know, just give me a call
whenever. I mean, um, if you want.

17:12.635 --> 17:14.184
Hmm. You have a
good night, Lindy.

17:14.185 --> 17:15.529
Good night.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.548
All right, okay, the
problem appears to be

17:19.549 --> 17:21.528
within your local system,
so I'm just gonna RDP

17:21.529 --> 17:23.207
into your box and
see what's going on.

17:25.719 --> 17:26.805
You okay?

17:31.967 --> 17:35.850
Ah, an app game is sucking up your
resources. I'm gonna go ahead and assume

17:35.851 --> 17:39.079
that that's not work related,
delete it, and reboot your system.

17:39.080 --> 17:42.222
Okay, bye now.
What's going on?

17:44.187 --> 17:45.851
Okay, okay, okay.

17:46.802 --> 17:48.646
Okay, I'm gonna show
you something, okay?

17:48.647 --> 17:52.889
But remember, homicide carries
a minimum sentence of 20 years.

18:01.888 --> 18:03.100
Who's "The Insomniac"?

18:04.161 --> 18:05.189
Connor.

18:10.210 --> 18:11.260
Who have you been talking to?

18:11.261 --> 18:13.281
It was Connor. He works
for Reconnoiter.

18:13.282 --> 18:16.251
Connor? Wait...
your friend Connor?

18:16.252 --> 18:18.381
He's not my friend.
He's Sophia's friend.

18:19.021 --> 18:21.124
He's a blogger, and you didn't
think to mention that

18:21.125 --> 18:23.124
when you brought
him into the Cyber Crimes Unit?

18:23.125 --> 18:25.206
His life was in danger. I
didn't think it mattered.

18:25.207 --> 18:28.036
Well, maybe if I'd known, I would
have kept him in the lobby.

18:28.037 --> 18:30.085
You know, you can blame me
all you want, but the story is

18:30.087 --> 18:32.090
out there, and I'm
just as angry about it as you are.

18:32.091 --> 18:35.300
Look, this gives the killer
exactly what he wants... credit.

18:35.301 --> 18:37.787
You know what these guys do when
they get an audience?

18:37.788 --> 18:42.167
They perform. I don't want him to
perform, because I suspect we're not even

18:42.168 --> 18:45.321
in the first act of his show, and
it's gonna get a lot more scary.

18:45.322 --> 18:47.152
We cannot have
this kind of leak.

18:47.153 --> 18:48.934
I'm handling it.

18:48.935 --> 18:56.851
1, 2, 3, 4... Go!
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

18:58.085 --> 19:00.444
(Claps) Let up. Practice
sparring with a partner.

19:06.675 --> 19:08.101
Radical, Connor.

19:08.102 --> 19:09.528
That was a lot of hits.

19:16.435 --> 19:18.831
It's my story too.
People have the right to know.

19:18.832 --> 19:19.907
There's a man missing.

19:19.907 --> 19:23.054
You're putting his life at risk. You're
putting everyone's life at risk.

19:23.055 --> 19:25.741
I'm helping people
protect themselves.

19:27.693 --> 19:28.514
(Groaning)

19:29.949 --> 19:31.598
Take the story down now.

19:31.599 --> 19:33.250
- I can't.
- Why not?

19:34.046 --> 19:38.053
'Cause that's not
his choice. It's mine.

19:39.435 --> 19:44.066
Hamish Stone, owner and
publisher of Reconnoiter Media.

19:45.335 --> 19:49.142
I know who you are, and I'd describe
you as more of a gossip profiteer.

19:49.143 --> 19:52.208
And you're the hacker
who dropped out of MIT

19:52.209 --> 19:56.459
when you sister disappeared,
moved to the Big Apple to look for her,

19:56.460 --> 19:59.355
and here we
all are, getting acquainted.

19:59.356 --> 20:02.478
Correct me if I'm wrong, but
hackers don't usually work with

20:02.479 --> 20:06.288
the police, do they? Especially
when they've got a record.

20:06.289 --> 20:10.065
Then again, this case
is rather personal for you, isn't it?

20:10.066 --> 20:12.025
Don't look at Connor.

20:12.026 --> 20:14.842
I googled you all by myself.

20:17.639 --> 20:19.800
What's it gonna
take for you to take the story down?

20:19.801 --> 20:22.018
Oh, I don't know.

20:22.825 --> 20:26.964
Catching him.
Until then, the story stays up.

20:41.925 --> 20:45.445
Bad news. You're fired.
(Laughing) Just kidding.

20:45.446 --> 20:46.913
- I covered for you.
- Thanks.

20:48.978 --> 20:50.657
Working.

20:52.747 --> 20:55.018
I say we hit Reconnoiter hard...

20:55.019 --> 20:57.159
send a botnet attack and down their
entire site

20:57.160 --> 20:58.269
until they delete the story.

20:58.270 --> 21:00.508
It's too late.
It's already gone viral.

21:00.509 --> 21:03.134
And bachelor
number two... they find him yet?

21:03.135 --> 21:05.214
No, not yet.

21:06.117 --> 21:07.968
But yesterday, the
killer sent me this.

21:10.112 --> 21:11.042
Freaky.

21:11.043 --> 21:12.678
Freaky, freak, freak, freak.

21:13.180 --> 21:14.892
Yeah. The parts that
don't belong were

21:14.893 --> 21:17.728
matched to three different unsolved
homicide victim photos,

21:17.729 --> 21:21.836
but the background never matched anything.
Any idea?

21:22.723 --> 21:23.885
It's like a Monet thing.

21:23.886 --> 21:29.437
Sometimes you gotta stand back
to get the full picture.

21:33.407 --> 21:36.644
It's static, but modern TVs
don't play static.

21:40.538 --> 21:44.133
Of course. That
is why I love you, George.

21:44.765 --> 21:47.571
Reese's TV was playing static
when we found the mannequins.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.799
We have to go back to
Reese's apartment.

21:54.610 --> 21:58.326
It's funny how people think "High Tech"
means "safer." (Exhaling)

22:01.482 --> 22:03.163
- Hello, my little friend.
- (Door opening)

22:03.164 --> 22:04.466
Can we hurry it up?

22:04.467 --> 22:08.562
Oh, relax, okay? I built this
baby to be quick, like a rabbit.

22:09.636 --> 22:13.723
Here we go. Okay. It's pulling the unique
code from the last time Reese used

22:13.724 --> 22:17.006
the keypad, re-routing
it back to the lock as if he were here,

22:17.007 --> 22:20.292
punching it in right now.

22:20.293 --> 22:23.888
- (Beeping)
- Oh! Like butter.

22:23.889 --> 22:24.782
Good job.

22:24.783 --> 22:26.486
It's so easy, it terrifies me.

22:30.045 --> 22:31.766
The mannequins were
sitting right here.

22:31.767 --> 22:32.586
Ever been on one of those dates

22:32.587 --> 22:34.539
where you talk
and wander around the city?

22:34.540 --> 22:36.295
That's what this is like, except

22:36.296 --> 22:39.931
we're wandering around
the mind of a psychotic killer.

22:40.466 --> 22:42.448
There's something on
the TV he wants me to see.

22:43.845 --> 22:44.468
(Beeping)

22:46.095 --> 22:48.845
"Mill of the Stone Woman",
"The Young, Evil, and Savage",

22:48.846 --> 22:53.592
"Phenomena", "Eyes without a Face",
"Ratman", "The Fifth Chord", "Inferno"?

22:53.593 --> 22:56.726
Yeah, those are old Italian horror
movies... classics.

22:56.727 --> 22:57.634
Uh, very obscure.

22:58.430 --> 23:01.046
It says he watched them all the night
Reese went missing.

23:02.325 --> 23:06.703
It's a message. "Mill of the
Stone Woman," "The Young..."

23:09.735 --> 23:21.467
Maybe it's the first letter of each title.
M-T-P-E-R-T-I-C-I-O.

23:21.468 --> 23:24.049
M-T perticio. That...
that doesn't make sense.

23:24.050 --> 23:26.379
Nope, it does not,
but if you're making an acronym,

23:26.380 --> 23:29.733
<i>maybe the "thes" don't count,
so it wouldn't be "The Fifth Chord,"</i>

23:29.734 --> 23:31.045
so use an "F," not a "T."

23:32.124 --> 23:34.993
My Perficio.

23:34.994 --> 23:37.865
My Perficio.

23:40.312 --> 23:43.173
Oh, my God. I know why he's
killing them.

23:43.827 --> 23:45.348
Perficio.

23:45.349 --> 23:48.312
He wants me to understand
why he's choosing his victims.

23:49.549 --> 23:51.189
Julia Becker hated her teeth.

23:51.190 --> 23:52.827
<i>Come on, one smile.</i>

23:54.040 --> 23:58.815
They were crooked, but she hated the
dentist more, so she never smiled.

23:59.124 --> 24:04.927
So, her killer pulled them out, carefully
cleaned out her mouth... made it perfect.

24:04.928 --> 24:06.907
- Some perfect.
- It's his perfect.

24:06.908 --> 24:10.359
He's excising the lie,
the imperfection from each victim.

24:11.126 --> 24:13.049
When I looked at the other
victims' social media,

24:13.653 --> 24:17.065
Anthony Morgan wore colored contacts.
His killer gouged out his eyes.

24:18.506 --> 24:23.108
Miranda McKenna had her breasts augmented.
Her killer cut out her implants.

24:23.109 --> 24:27.710
Michael Kelly severely bit his nails
and his killer severed his fingers.

24:28.410 --> 24:32.672
Even Emily Erickson's murder follows a
pattern. Her killer targeted her face,

24:32.673 --> 24:34.328
her skin.

24:37.114 --> 24:39.110
The Internet's a place
where you can create an illusion,

24:39.111 --> 24:41.972
show people only
what you want them to see...

24:43.019 --> 24:46.279
but when reality didn't match up with
what the killer saw on Flirtual,

24:46.280 --> 24:50.311
he punished them. He wants perfection.
He's searching for it.

24:50.312 --> 24:53.496
And when people
lied about their flaws, he killed them.

24:53.497 --> 24:54.598
Perficio.

24:54.599 --> 24:56.904
Exactly.

24:56.905 --> 25:00.412
But "Perficio" doesn't just
mean "Perfection."

25:00.413 --> 25:03.571
I mean, if you take
it back to the literal translation,

25:03.572 --> 25:09.212
it means "to finish,
to bring to an end, a finishing."

25:10.943 --> 25:13.481
That doesn't sound optimistic,
now, does it?

25:15.821 --> 25:16.904
Great work.

25:17.667 --> 25:20.241
(Phone ringing) (Beeping)

25:20.242 --> 25:23.908
<i>Where are you? You forgot
the egg rolls, didn't you?</i>

25:25.141 --> 25:28.599
Nope. I'm picking them up now.
(Groaning)

25:39.179 --> 25:43.584
That's, uh... that's all I have.
Thank you.

25:49.506 --> 25:50.403
What was that about?

25:50.404 --> 25:54.059
The IT department at his law firm found
malware on his cell phone...

25:54.060 --> 25:55.703
Filled out a formal report.

26:05.594 --> 26:07.140
You're not answering my calls.

26:09.762 --> 26:11.281
You're not used
to girls doing that, are you?

26:11.282 --> 26:12.339
I'm serious.

26:12.901 --> 26:15.200
Jake Bolin just swung
by the Cyber Crimes Unit.

26:15.201 --> 26:17.501
He reported the spyware
you put on his phone.

26:19.122 --> 26:21.715
There's no way to know if he suspects
you or if he knows

26:21.716 --> 26:23.602
we've been following
him, but we might have just gotten made.

26:23.603 --> 26:24.267
That's not good.

26:24.268 --> 26:25.908
Look, if he tries to contact you...

26:26.207 --> 26:27.232
No Jake.

26:27.632 --> 26:28.820
I got it.

26:29.835 --> 26:33.975
Hey, I didn't get a chance
to say it earlier, but good work today.

26:36.213 --> 26:37.511
Thanks.

26:37.512 --> 26:41.314
But the next time you want to break
into a crime scene, call me first.

26:41.315 --> 26:42.451
I'll handle it.

26:42.452 --> 26:44.005
Maybe I wanted to
handle it myself.

26:44.983 --> 26:46.122
Call me first.

26:46.719 --> 26:49.744
Look, I need you to stay in tonight
with this Jake thing going on.

26:49.745 --> 26:53.335
The last thing I want to do is go out.
I just need a quiet night in,

26:53.336 --> 26:56.521
alone with my room mate,
eating egg rolls. Sophia?

26:56.522 --> 27:01.316
All: Surprise!
(Party horns tooting)

27:01.317 --> 27:02.670
Your birthday?

27:05.188 --> 27:06.437
Yeah.

27:12.861 --> 27:15.444
Ladies. Hey, how's it going?
You got a boyfriend?

27:15.444 --> 27:17.613
Yeah, I'm taken too.
It'll never work. Sorry.

27:18.112 --> 27:19.718
No means no, ladies.

27:19.719 --> 27:22.526
#

27:24.288 --> 27:25.289
I'm sorry about Connor.

27:25.290 --> 27:29.191
I didn't think he would do something
like that. He's banished.

27:29.192 --> 27:30.007
Forgive me?

27:30.008 --> 27:31.867
I can't believe you threw me a party.

27:31.868 --> 27:33.105
I hate you.

27:34.276 --> 27:36.273
And how did you even know it
was my birthday?

27:36.274 --> 27:38.599
What kind of person doesn't
know their best friend's birthday?

27:38.600 --> 27:40.581
Besides, I thought
we were trying to be normal.

27:40.582 --> 27:42.525
Me not liking things
like this is normal.

27:42.526 --> 27:44.281
Okay, you need another drink.

27:44.282 --> 27:45.941
#

27:53.243 --> 27:55.304
You really don't
want to do that, man.

28:01.517 --> 28:02.991
Thanks, but I'm on duty.

28:02.992 --> 28:04.814
Maybe some other time?

28:07.158 --> 28:08.792
Buenas noches.

28:10.271 --> 28:11.603
You a cop?

28:11.604 --> 28:12.632
How'd you guess?

28:12.633 --> 28:13.971
You smell like a cop.

28:15.246 --> 28:16.618
You're Lindy's cop.

28:16.619 --> 28:17.738
Tommy.

28:18.245 --> 28:21.646
Well, Tommy, you'd
better take care of her.

28:30.214 --> 28:31.337
Hey.

28:34.890 --> 28:36.210
Fun party.

28:38.211 --> 28:39.572
Yeah, I hate my birthday too.

28:41.253 --> 28:42.683
It's not that.

28:43.682 --> 28:47.698
- I miss him.
- I miss him too.

28:47.699 --> 28:50.349
Lindy, look! Wendy made us
Jell-O shots!

28:50.350 --> 28:55.477
Uhh! We love her! Mmm, they're
champagne... ironically.

28:57.253 --> 29:00.505
Look, they say it's important to
feel whatever it is you're feeling.

29:03.357 --> 29:05.430
What if you feel too much?

29:05.431 --> 29:07.290
<i>Lindy, come on.</i>

29:10.528 --> 29:14.332
Sure, the Tango is the dance of love,
but Guianos know,

29:14.333 --> 29:17.419
the dance of
unbridled passion is the Guaguanco.

29:19.585 --> 29:20.489
All right.

29:20.490 --> 29:22.191
(Phone ringing)

29:22.192 --> 29:23.641
Calligan.

29:25.938 --> 29:27.892
#

29:29.047 --> 29:31.334
To friends! (Cheering)

29:31.335 --> 29:32.887
#

29:37.797 --> 29:40.392
They found Reese Hennessey's clothes.
I have to go.

29:41.351 --> 29:43.187
Don't let Lindy out
of your sight, okay?

29:44.598 --> 29:45.372
(Cheering)

29:46.100 --> 29:47.566
To horses' hooves!

29:47.567 --> 29:48.929
#

29:48.930 --> 29:53.521
'Cause that's what gelatin's made from.
You know, horses' hooves.

29:56.103 --> 29:58.094
Hey, Lindy, come dance with us!

29:58.095 --> 29:59.131
#

30:02.862 --> 30:04.344
Sophia, who are these people?

30:04.734 --> 30:06.729
- Your friends.
- No, they're your friends.

30:06.730 --> 30:08.370
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

30:12.441 --> 30:15.435
Oh, no.
It's Jake.

30:23.869 --> 30:24.958
You invited him?

30:24.959 --> 30:26.502
It must have been after
he made us dinner.

30:26.503 --> 30:29.345
We were a little tipsy, remember?
We liked him, we liked him...

30:29.346 --> 30:32.959
Back when we were positive the other
guy was the one killing people.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.542
Well, now he's the main suspect.

30:36.538 --> 30:38.542
Find detective Yaeger.
Tell him he's here.

30:38.543 --> 30:39.522
So he can arrest him?

30:39.523 --> 30:42.430
No, they don't have enough evidence.
They need to wait until he slips up.

30:42.431 --> 30:43.400
At my surprise party?

30:43.401 --> 30:45.351
There are a million people here.
He's not gonna do anything.

30:47.089 --> 30:49.174
Hey, Happy Birthday.

30:50.270 --> 30:51.241
Thanks.

30:51.242 --> 30:53.582
I'm sorry, I was rushing. I
didn't get a chance to wrap it.

30:53.978 --> 30:55.051
"How to Cook and Have a Life"?

30:55.052 --> 30:55.817
Yeah, it's just a bunch of

30:55.818 --> 30:58.580
take-out menus from
all my favorite places in the city.

30:58.944 --> 31:01.652
That's, um... that's
really creative.

31:02.884 --> 31:05.750
Look, I'm sorry we haven't had much time
to see each other,

31:05.751 --> 31:09.424
but work's been a nightmare lately.
But I'm glad Sophia invited me.

31:10.145 --> 31:12.391
- Me too.
- (Doorbell buzzing)

31:16.168 --> 31:16.835
What?

31:16.836 --> 31:19.065
<i>You can't just ignore
my calls, Sophia.</i>

31:19.066 --> 31:21.155
I'm mad at you, Connor.
You can't come up.

31:21.156 --> 31:23.088
<i>Too late. Some tenants
just let me in.</i>

31:35.223 --> 31:36.216
You have to go.

31:36.217 --> 31:39.408
- I was invited.
- Well, now you're disinvited.

31:39.409 --> 31:42.661
How could you write up that story?
You were sworn to secrecy, okay?

31:42.662 --> 31:43.724
Lindy is my best friend.

31:43.725 --> 31:45.059
I thought I was
your best friend.

31:45.060 --> 31:46.405
That's up for review.

31:46.406 --> 31:48.738
So, let me in and I'll
apologize to Lindy.

31:48.739 --> 31:50.263
Sorry, you forfeited that right.

31:50.264 --> 31:50.879
You know what?

31:50.880 --> 31:54.246
I'm not sorry I wrote that piece.
It's important.

31:54.247 --> 31:55.230
People are dying.

31:55.231 --> 31:57.829
Shh! I am trying to throw a party.

31:57.830 --> 31:58.436
Everything okay?

31:58.437 --> 32:03.174
Detective Yaeger, can you please
escort my dis-invited

32:03.175 --> 32:05.628
best friend out?

32:12.031 --> 32:13.578
Really?

32:25.339 --> 32:27.234
(Cheering)

32:27.235 --> 32:28.350
#

32:28.351 --> 32:31.212
So, um, nobody does flowers anymore.

32:31.213 --> 32:33.231
Are you still
holding that against me?

32:33.232 --> 32:35.205
I was just surprised.

32:36.387 --> 32:38.837
What do you mean? Like, a little
chivalry isn't your thing?

32:39.454 --> 32:42.060
No, I just never gave you my address.

32:42.616 --> 32:47.999
Oh. Well, I mean, anyone can
find your address with a cell phone number.

32:49.839 --> 32:50.797
Right.

32:51.652 --> 32:53.113
Creeped you out, didn't I?

32:53.448 --> 32:54.873
A little.

32:54.874 --> 33:00.054
Sometimes I fantasize about owning a
farm... like, a small, quiet farm.

33:03.012 --> 33:04.642
Are you listening to me?

33:04.643 --> 33:05.352
Yeah.

33:05.353 --> 33:06.672
I grew up on a farm.

33:06.673 --> 33:08.764
- Really?
- No.

33:09.167 --> 33:13.983
I grew up in the Bronx. You're about as
much of a farm girl as I'm a farm boy.

33:14.833 --> 33:17.587
So, what you're saying is, I'm
really like more of a city girl.

33:18.460 --> 33:20.427
I'm saying you're
really like trouble.

33:23.475 --> 33:28.348
Look, I'm sorry. I grew up in a family
that loves surprises, like, you know?

33:28.349 --> 33:30.308
It's just how my brain's wired.

33:32.219 --> 33:35.689
Hey, you okay?

33:36.595 --> 33:39.139
Um, I think I might
have had too much to drink.

33:39.140 --> 33:40.984
Okay, let's sit you down.

33:42.293 --> 33:44.437
I'm gonna get you a
glass of water, okay?

34:01.796 --> 34:04.034
(Smoke detector blaring)

34:04.337 --> 34:05.621
Smoke.

34:05.622 --> 34:07.516
There's smoke coming from the
bathroom.

34:07.517 --> 34:08.760
(Smoke detector blaring)

34:13.482 --> 34:14.953
Call came in an hour ago.

34:14.954 --> 34:18.056
A janitor found them in the
basement of an apartment building.

34:18.058 --> 34:19.726
What's the building's address?

34:21.463 --> 34:24.083
- It's Jake Bolin's apartment.
- Oh, no.

34:28.309 --> 34:30.216
(Smoke alarm blaring)

34:30.217 --> 34:33.842
Okay. Like, who threw a
lit joint in the trash can?

34:36.228 --> 34:40.271
(Cell phone buzzing)

34:54.770 --> 35:02.664
<i>There you are. You passed my test.
I need to show you something.</i>

35:07.183 --> 35:09.729
Ah, hush. Hush, now.

35:10.968 --> 35:11.345
Everything is going to be
all right.

35:11.654 --> 35:12.536
Lindy!

35:13.547 --> 35:14.622
Lindy?

35:20.589 --> 35:22.862
Hey! (Whistling) Yo!

35:23.346 --> 35:25.177
Has anyone seen Lindy?

35:27.280 --> 35:30.498
Don't move.
Where's Lindy?

35:30.892 --> 35:33.416
She was right there, I swear.
I just went to get a glass of...

35:33.417 --> 35:34.619
On your knees.

35:35.061 --> 35:36.560
On your knees!

35:41.710 --> 35:43.197
I didn't touch her.

It looks that way.

37:32.132 --> 37:34.807
He was in custody when you
witnessed Reese's murder.

37:34.808 --> 37:36.417
The clothes were planted at
his apartment.

37:36.417 --> 37:37.832
He's not our guy.

37:41.669 --> 37:45.593
I should have never left you alone
at that party. I made a bad call.

37:46.999 --> 37:49.746
And what happened to
you... that's on me.

37:50.684 --> 37:53.087
I'll never let that happen
again, okay?

37:56.231 --> 38:00.382
Reese, Peter, Ben...

38:01.081 --> 38:03.034
He killed them all
because of me.

38:03.035 --> 38:03.910
Lindy, you can't
keep thinking...

38:03.911 --> 38:05.877
Why did he let me
live last night?

38:05.978 --> 38:09.841
Well, if he's looking for flaws,
maybe he doesn't see any in you.

38:10.410 --> 38:13.269
Perfection doesn't exist, and
he's sick to think that it does.

38:14.510 --> 38:18.234
Everybody's flawed...
especially me.

38:18.735 --> 38:21.689
What do you think he's gonna do
when he finally figures that out?

38:36.406 --> 38:42.135
<i>I knew you'd do it. I hoped
you'd solve my riddle, my test.</i>

38:45.836 --> 38:52.370
<i>So, here is my reward to you.
Lindy, you're the one...</i>

38:52.773 --> 39:00.589
<i>The one to understand me, the one who
can really know me, challenge me.</i>

39:07.091 --> 39:09.598
<i>The gifts I want to give you...</i>

39:09.599 --> 39:11.533
<i>Wear it for me.</i>

39:12.441 --> 39:14.233
<i>Wear your pain.</i>

39:15.147 --> 39:19.395
<i>We should all be reminded
of what we've lost.</i>

39:21.860 --> 39:23.438
<i>He is out there.</i>

39:23.439 --> 39:24.195
<i>Searching.</i>

39:24.396 --> 39:25.544
<i>Following.</i>

39:25.545 --> 39:26.602
<i>Killing.</i>

39:26.603 --> 39:28.692
<i>I know you're watching me.</i>

39:30.199 --> 39:31.603
<i>Come and get me.</i>
