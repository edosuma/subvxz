WEBVTT

00:19.853 --> 00:22.105
Okay, no one can know about this.

00:22.188 --> 00:24.399
Of course Sawyer
finished off most of the bottle.

00:24.482 --> 00:26.818
In his defense, there was hardly any left.

00:26.901 --> 00:29.195
Why do you think I signed us up
for science club?

00:29.279 --> 00:30.905
I don't know. You hate sleep?

00:31.489 --> 00:33.199
If we're going to stop those witches,

00:33.283 --> 00:35.577
we'll need
as much hiding potion as we can get.

00:35.660 --> 00:38.121
Okay, then.
Less chat, more action.

00:38.204 --> 00:39.789
School starts in half an hour.

00:40.498 --> 00:44.044
Lucy, are you sure
you got all the right ingredients?

00:44.127 --> 00:45.420
You really found newt hair?

00:45.503 --> 00:48.757
Newt hair, dog hair.
Is it really that different?

00:49.549 --> 00:50.383
Yes.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.343
Okay.

00:52.427 --> 00:53.762
What's next?

00:53.845 --> 00:58.767
Stepswirl the potion and say
the words, "Setus Mofis in Venificiis."

00:58.850 --> 01:01.519
-Setus mofis in… what?

01:02.103 --> 01:05.690
Venifici-us… Something like that.

01:05.774 --> 01:08.485
-Venifmishermuffer.

01:11.237 --> 01:14.074
-Nothing's happening.

01:14.157 --> 01:17.452
-Whoa! Okay, um…

01:17.952 --> 01:19.704
I-I think we should leave.

01:25.502 --> 01:28.963
Ugh. What is it?
Wreck-the-school day in science club?

01:29.547 --> 01:32.175
I'll stick to
student council, thank you.

01:36.012 --> 01:39.641
What is happening?

01:44.145 --> 01:46.606
What did you weirdos do to me?

01:46.689 --> 01:49.275
I look like a walking meatloaf
with owl eyes!

01:49.359 --> 01:51.778
This is not good.

01:51.861 --> 01:55.031
-Mm, neither is that.

01:56.407 --> 01:57.784
-Oh, no.
-Oh my…

01:57.867 --> 01:58.701
Goodness.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.163
Return the form that she came from!

02:02.247 --> 02:03.790
Did you just hex me?

02:03.873 --> 02:05.375
Why isn't she turning back?

02:05.959 --> 02:08.628
Maybe because we don't
really know what we're doing.

02:08.711 --> 02:11.005
Turn me back. Turn me back.
Turn me back right now!

03:16.362 --> 03:18.156
Hey! Oh…

04:07.455 --> 04:08.289
Whoa.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.416
Okay, I am pretty sure

04:10.500 --> 04:13.628
that using the science lab
to create potions is against school rules,

04:14.504 --> 04:18.508
but I have to admit, turning kids
into cats, that's totally increds.

04:18.591 --> 04:22.637
By "increds"
you had better mean terrifying.

04:22.720 --> 04:26.641
We've tried everything we usually do
to turn them back, but nothing's working.

04:26.724 --> 04:28.184
Alright. Okay.

04:32.438 --> 04:33.606
The Witch Encyclopedia.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.902
Alright. Potions, potions…

04:37.986 --> 04:38.987
Did you say potions?

04:39.070 --> 04:41.155
Did you use every ingredient on your list?

04:41.239 --> 04:42.198
Um…

04:42.282 --> 04:43.616
Yeah, pretty much.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.535
When making potions,

04:45.618 --> 04:48.371
directions must be followed exactly,

04:48.454 --> 04:50.748
or the spell won't work.

04:51.416 --> 04:56.296
Essentially, you've created
your own unknown, very different potion.

04:56.379 --> 04:59.549
I'd say that's an accurate assessment.

04:59.632 --> 05:02.302
Is there a spell reversal potion?

05:02.385 --> 05:04.387
I couldn't find one. Want to look?

05:06.222 --> 05:08.141
Oh, this is gorgeous.

05:09.892 --> 05:12.270
Wow. Oh my goodness.

05:13.354 --> 05:17.317
Oh my gosh,
there is an invisibility potion.

05:17.859 --> 05:20.403
-I always thought that was a myth. Wow.
-Ms. Juniper?

05:20.486 --> 05:22.530
-Focus.
-Right. Okay, sorry.

05:22.613 --> 05:24.991
Reversal, reversal, reversal.

05:25.074 --> 05:27.869
Oh, here we go. Yeah, this should work.

05:27.952 --> 05:30.121
Should?! Should work?!

05:30.204 --> 05:32.040
Have you seen me?!

05:32.123 --> 05:36.836
Okay. We'll attempt
a new magic potion while you catsit?

05:36.919 --> 05:39.172
-You better hurry, Willa Ward!
-Okay, bye!

05:39.255 --> 05:42.133
Uh… Well, I-I-I'm available for other…

05:42.216 --> 05:44.927
Other jobs, more fun jobs, witchy jobs.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.395
Huh. Pew!

06:00.943 --> 06:01.778
Urgh.

06:09.243 --> 06:13.122
"Dear Willa.
Join us for tea and treats after school."

06:13.206 --> 06:17.960
"P.S. We live in the old house
at the top of the hill."

06:22.882 --> 06:25.468
Okay. We can do this, right?

06:25.551 --> 06:29.222
I hope so.
Getting expelled is not on my bucket list.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.599
What 12-year-old has a bucket list?

06:31.682 --> 06:34.769
A playlist? Yes. But a bucket list? No.

06:35.561 --> 06:38.523
Two teaspoons of dried pine cone.

06:40.566 --> 06:43.611
Okay, now swirl the amulet
counterclockwise.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.364
"Reverso reversus"

06:46.447 --> 06:48.825
"Reverse the spell
Mistakenly put upon thus"

06:48.908 --> 06:50.493
Isn't that clockwise?

06:55.206 --> 06:56.249
-Whoa.

06:56.332 --> 06:58.126
I think it's working anyway.

06:59.627 --> 07:03.548
Wouldn't it be cool if we accidentally
made the world's most delicious cupcake.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.884
Sorry. Focus. Got it.

07:06.968 --> 07:07.802
Yeah.

07:13.891 --> 07:15.643
Okay, ready?

07:17.395 --> 07:18.813
-Principal McKay!

07:18.896 --> 07:22.442
Willa Ward is using the science club
to create really weird potions

07:22.525 --> 07:24.402
and very weird things are happening.

07:24.485 --> 07:27.822
Unauthorized science experiments
are strictly prohibited in this school.

07:27.905 --> 07:30.533
This is very much unauthorized.

07:30.616 --> 07:35.079
She's messing around in the science room
with this super weird amulet.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.793
-Excuse me, Wyatt.

07:41.836 --> 07:42.670
Yes!

07:44.213 --> 07:46.549
-Oh, thank goodness.
-Okay.

07:46.632 --> 07:50.303
We're super sorry for that weird slip-up,
but we are here to fix you.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.430
-Dropper?
-Dropper.

07:52.513 --> 07:53.681
-Dropper.
-Dropper.

07:54.348 --> 07:55.183
Thank you.

07:55.266 --> 07:57.351
Stay away from me.

07:57.435 --> 08:01.189
I'm not drinking any glowing
purple sludge smoothie. Urgh!

08:01.772 --> 08:02.940
-Whoa!

08:04.901 --> 08:09.280
Amazing and mystical,
but probably not good.

08:09.363 --> 08:10.198
Uh…

08:12.658 --> 08:16.704
Okay. Girls, to your desks.
Act normal. I'll handle the cats.

08:16.787 --> 08:18.039
Okay.

08:19.540 --> 08:22.960
-Let's do this. You first.

08:24.795 --> 08:28.508
You stay quiet, you understand me?
Gosh, you're cute.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.221
-You, too. Let's go.
-Put me down!

08:33.304 --> 08:35.598
And go buy me
some intensive wrinkle cream!

08:37.850 --> 08:38.684
Whew!

08:41.604 --> 08:43.898
Good morning, students!

08:44.565 --> 08:49.570
Welcome to a normal,
everything-is-perfectly-normal day!

08:49.654 --> 08:55.535
As student president, I stand against
locking student-cats in the closet!

08:56.202 --> 09:01.457
I, for one, am reporting this
to Principal McKay immediately!

09:18.975 --> 09:20.184
Yep, perfectly normal.

09:20.268 --> 09:22.395
-What?

09:32.822 --> 09:36.826
Willa, we are officially in
I-need-to-call-your-dad territory now

09:36.909 --> 09:40.413
with all of this magic business.
It's getting a little out of control.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.374
Though it is amazing.

09:43.457 --> 09:46.961
Seems like we've created our first
legit potion. That's, that's a first.

09:47.044 --> 09:48.170
You call this legit?

09:48.254 --> 09:50.298
In a I-can-see-right-up-your-nose
kinda way!

09:50.381 --> 09:51.757
What are we gonna do?

10:14.155 --> 10:17.825
Good thing it's not spreading.
The floor is still the floor out here.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.494
-Come on.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.872
…get to the bottom of this.

10:23.998 --> 10:25.833
Ms. Juniper, is Willa Ward--

10:36.886 --> 10:40.473
What just happened?

10:40.556 --> 10:43.059
Well this is fun, guys. Right?

10:43.142 --> 10:46.687
I'm upside down. I'm stuck upside down.

10:46.771 --> 10:50.483
This is against the laws of physics.
Willa Ward?

10:59.158 --> 11:04.080
Well, my sweet sister,
we are officially running out of time.

11:04.163 --> 11:08.250
Hopefully Wyatt will come through
with a surprise for us today,

11:08.334 --> 11:12.088
but uh, if not, we need a plan W.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.798
You know what I'm saying?

11:13.881 --> 11:19.929
Seeking answers we so need
Give us them, we'll repay the deed

11:20.012 --> 11:23.808
Wilma, please, get with it.
The cauldron, it doesn't have the answer.

11:23.891 --> 11:27.561
Stop being so old-school. Don't stereotype
us as witches, you know what I mean?

11:27.645 --> 11:33.275
Seeking answers we so need
Give us them, we'll repay the deed

11:33.359 --> 11:36.821
-Aha! See?

11:36.904 --> 11:41.242
It's working. A vision. A vision of…

11:43.327 --> 11:44.995
Normal Neil?

11:45.079 --> 11:47.123
That's not what I was expecting.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.834
I knew the cauldron
was going to have the answer.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.752
-But, you just--
-Look.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.922
He's right here
on our front porch.

11:55.005 --> 11:58.926
The dark forces
have delivered him right to us.

12:01.345 --> 12:03.639
Door.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.522
My triceps are killing me.

12:12.940 --> 12:16.152
-Principal McKay.

12:19.864 --> 12:20.906
Blaine?

12:20.990 --> 12:22.700
Yes, it's me, Blaine,

12:22.783 --> 12:26.370
student council president
and all around winning student.

12:26.454 --> 12:29.832
I am here to inform you
of infractions against

12:29.915 --> 12:32.668
Winding Way Middle School's
code of conduct.

12:33.252 --> 12:38.174
Willa Ward is a mad scientist!
She was in a lab and turned us into cats.

12:38.257 --> 12:39.967
Willa Ward.

12:45.347 --> 12:48.184
Okay, you can do this.

12:52.771 --> 12:54.315
I hope you have a good lawyer.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.738
Uh, anybody home?

13:04.492 --> 13:06.702
-Hello?

13:10.414 --> 13:16.170
Well, well, well.
If it isn't the infamous Normal Neil.

13:16.253 --> 13:18.672
-How do you know my name?

13:19.632 --> 13:22.593
-And what do you want with my daughter?
-Why don't you sit down?

13:22.676 --> 13:25.346
Join us for a spot of tea.

13:25.429 --> 13:26.472
Uh, no thank you.

13:26.555 --> 13:27.640
We insist.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.850
I'm fine, actually.

13:29.934 --> 13:34.647
When we insist you take a seat
You can fight but you'll be beat

13:37.399 --> 13:39.527
How did you…

13:39.610 --> 13:42.071
I saw you two on Shark Tank.

13:43.155 --> 13:45.908
The self-seating chairs.

13:47.451 --> 13:52.498
Okay, no mistakes this time.
Do exactly as it says.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.585
No, Willa! Counterclockwise.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.755
-What on Earth is going on here?
-Uh, nothing.

13:59.838 --> 14:02.716
Willa Ward,
you put me right side up this minute!

14:02.800 --> 14:04.927
Looks like something from
the upside down cla--

14:05.010 --> 14:08.722
Hi, Principal McKay.
Y-Y-You look great.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.266
-Yeah.
-New shoes?

14:10.349 --> 14:12.101
-Yeah, it's the shoes.
-Yeah.

14:12.184 --> 14:15.521
I have no choice
but to confiscate that amulet

14:15.604 --> 14:17.731
and whatever experiment
you're conducting here.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.316
I can't give you this. It's--

14:19.400 --> 14:21.944
My office, right now. Let's go.

14:23.195 --> 14:24.738
This is remarkably difficult.

14:29.952 --> 14:33.789
Hey, look, if it means that much to you
for me to try your tea, I'll try your tea.

14:33.873 --> 14:37.543
-I'll drink a big ol' mug of it.
-No, you lamebrain.

14:37.626 --> 14:40.212
Ha! Yeah, lamebrain.

14:42.464 --> 14:46.719
You gave our amulet to Willa,
and now we want it back.

14:47.303 --> 14:49.096
-Ha!

14:54.018 --> 14:56.270
Uh, that's me.

14:57.271 --> 14:58.814
Pocket right there.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.904
Yeah, that's my daughter's school.
I have to take this.

15:04.987 --> 15:06.196
Um, green button.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.034
Normal Nei--

15:11.702 --> 15:14.038
-Neil speaking.
-Mr. Ward.

15:14.121 --> 15:17.041
Your daughter Willa is in big trouble.

15:17.124 --> 15:20.878
I've taken away her strange amulet,
and I will be securing it in our safe,

15:20.961 --> 15:24.757
and I need you
to get down here right away.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.092
-Goodbye.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.095
Opportunity knocks.

15:30.596 --> 15:35.517
Willa needs me. I'm going to
have to raincheck whatever this is.

15:35.601 --> 15:36.602
Right in there. Yeah.

15:38.562 --> 15:39.647
Can you close the flap?

15:42.024 --> 15:46.153
You do get that we are witches, right?

15:46.236 --> 15:47.363
It's a thing, you know.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.658
Look, my kid needs me,
and I'm all she's got.

15:50.741 --> 15:53.369
I promised my wife
that if anything ever happened to her,

15:53.452 --> 15:57.247
I would take good care of Willa forever,
and I keep my promises.

15:57.331 --> 16:03.045
So, you can either get out of my way,
or I will get you out of it.

16:03.879 --> 16:05.714
-Ooh…

16:05.798 --> 16:08.759
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

16:08.842 --> 16:11.679
-Oh, boy!
-Oh! Oh, did you slip?

16:12.262 --> 16:13.973
Someone have a boo-boo?

16:14.056 --> 16:18.352
Sit tight, Boring Neil.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.188
-Wilma, get the brooms.
-Got it.

16:22.106 --> 16:26.151
We're gonna head to the school
and get what is rightfully ours,

16:26.235 --> 16:27.987
once and for all.

16:28.570 --> 16:29.405
Bye.

16:32.866 --> 16:35.661
-Should have stayed out of it, Neil.

16:35.744 --> 16:38.998
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm a rat, I can talk.
Yadda, yadda, yadda.

16:39.081 --> 16:42.584
Okay, look, you give me a ride to
the school, and I'll get you out of here.

16:43.335 --> 16:44.712
-You--
-Deal?

16:44.795 --> 16:45.796
What? Why?

16:45.879 --> 16:48.507
Look, either they get Willa first,
or we do.

16:49.091 --> 16:52.678
-What's it gonna be?

17:04.398 --> 17:06.400
Hello.

17:07.818 --> 17:09.862
Hey, thanks for letting Fink hitch a lift.

17:09.945 --> 17:14.199
And thank you for getting me out of there.
I'm going to go find out what's happening,

17:14.283 --> 17:17.786
and hopefully
never speak to a talking rat again.

17:17.870 --> 17:22.332
Do you really think we should be
sneaking out of the principal's office?

17:23.167 --> 17:25.169
Oh, no. My dad's here.

17:25.252 --> 17:26.712
-Eek!
-Mr. Ward.

17:26.795 --> 17:28.255
Good, you're here.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.799
Willa is in my office.

17:30.883 --> 17:34.428
Uh, I can't tell
if you're red in the face with anger

17:34.511 --> 17:38.015
or it's just that
all of the blood has rushed into it.

17:38.098 --> 17:41.602
Give me a sec. It's been a day.

17:41.685 --> 17:43.020
Well, listen.

17:43.103 --> 17:46.940
I'm sure whatever Willa has done,
she had very good reason for doing it.

17:47.024 --> 17:49.068
Oh, you're in so much trouble.

17:49.151 --> 17:51.987
Follow me.

17:52.071 --> 17:55.032
Oh, amulet. Where are you?
Come out, come out.

17:55.115 --> 17:55.949
The witches!

17:56.033 --> 17:57.993
-Aunties!

17:58.077 --> 18:01.663
Oh, you have redeemed yourself, big time!

18:01.747 --> 18:03.123
Hey, that's mine!

18:03.749 --> 18:05.667
Oops. Run!

18:05.751 --> 18:09.254
-First, we'll get the girls.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.632
We'll be back for the amulet soon!

18:12.216 --> 18:13.884
They're coming! What do we do?

18:13.967 --> 18:16.386
I don't know. Maybe the witch book knows.

18:16.470 --> 18:19.431
-Wait a minute.

18:20.224 --> 18:21.767
The Fixer Elixir!

18:21.850 --> 18:25.562
"Problems shall all disappear
If one can dance like no one’s near"

18:25.646 --> 18:28.482
"Fix all the binds
And erase all minds"

18:28.565 --> 18:29.983
"For emergency use only."

18:30.067 --> 18:33.070
If this isn't an emergency,
I don't know what is!

18:33.153 --> 18:35.114
-Quick!

18:41.620 --> 18:44.998
-How do we know what it does?
-I don't know, but I'm willing to risk it.

18:45.082 --> 18:46.708
Okay, here goes nothing.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.923
-Huh?
-What is happening?

18:54.758 --> 18:56.593
Oh. Mm.

18:56.677 --> 19:00.681
-What? What is happening?
-What is happening?

19:16.530 --> 19:18.740
What are you doing? Stop that.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.784
I can't stop. I gotta groove.

19:21.618 --> 19:23.871
Everybody get back. It's contagious!

19:25.539 --> 19:29.793
Cats, classrooms, and now crazy dancing!

19:29.877 --> 19:32.171
Now this is what school should be.

19:45.392 --> 19:49.229
Mr. Ward, thank goodness
you are here. We should talk.

19:49.313 --> 19:53.859
Sure, Ms. Juniper. Just as soon as
this beat lets go of its hold on me!

20:01.116 --> 20:02.117
No!

20:03.952 --> 20:04.995
Lucy!

20:13.795 --> 20:15.255
Scout, catch!

20:15.339 --> 20:16.173
Huh?

20:16.256 --> 20:19.301
Feel the beat!

20:22.387 --> 20:25.641
I got it! Oh, I got the amulet.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.142
Where is it?

20:28.352 --> 20:29.811
Oh, no, no, no.

20:29.895 --> 20:33.857
I’ve made such a mess of everything,
and now I’ve lost the amulet, too.

20:33.941 --> 20:36.109
Psst. Hey, Willa. Over here.

20:38.445 --> 20:39.738
Looking for this?

20:40.280 --> 20:42.741
You should really keep
a tighter grip on this thing.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.535
I thought you wanted to steal it.

20:45.619 --> 20:49.039
I promised I'd keep it safe,
and it's time I kept my promises.

20:49.122 --> 20:51.583
I, uh, I see you used the Fixer Elixir.

20:51.667 --> 20:52.501
Yeah.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.711
How did you know?

20:54.795 --> 20:58.131
We don't have much time. The witches
aren't going to stop chasing you.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.675
W-W-Why are you helping me?

20:59.758 --> 21:02.552
Look in the back of
your mom's secret armoire,

21:02.636 --> 21:04.471
and you'll find the help you need.

21:04.554 --> 21:07.933
I can't even remember
why we came to the school today.

21:08.016 --> 21:11.770
Okay, this is pure torture.
We have to get out of here.

21:11.853 --> 21:13.397
Nothing is worth this!

21:14.064 --> 21:15.482
Ooh! I gotta get out of here.

21:33.375 --> 21:34.334
It worked.

21:34.418 --> 21:36.878
I think it'll be best if we just, uh…

21:37.754 --> 21:38.880
see ourselves out.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.090
Yeah.

21:41.091 --> 21:42.426
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

21:46.430 --> 21:50.017
I’m still a bit confused,
like today’s just been erased.

21:50.100 --> 21:53.770
Zapped! Poof! Like magic, or something.

21:54.313 --> 21:57.607
Uh, maybe you’ve been
meditating a little too much.

21:57.691 --> 21:59.067
You erased all your thoughts.

21:59.151 --> 22:03.030
Meditating? I om-ed them away?

22:04.531 --> 22:07.576
Well, a calm mind is a happy one, I guess.

22:09.703 --> 22:11.371
-Night, Willa.
-Night, Dad.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.689
Whoa.
