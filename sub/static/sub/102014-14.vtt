[thunderclap]

00:06.172 --> 00:08.216
[doorbell rings]

00:11.094 --> 00:13.471
[Cheryl] Min-Min, you made it.

00:13.513 --> 00:14.597
[thunder rumbling]

00:14.639 --> 00:15.515
[speaks French]

00:16.725 --> 00:17.600
[thunderclap]

00:25.233 --> 00:27.318
[Minerva] I've alerted
the auction house
of my whereabouts.

00:27.360 --> 00:31.364
So if you're thinking
of sacrificing me to
your crimson gods, don't.

00:31.406 --> 00:34.034
First of all,
they're goddesses.

00:34.075 --> 00:38.913
And I would never
dream of doing such
a thing to you, Pet.

00:38.955 --> 00:41.374
I hope you'll consider
this evening an apology.

00:41.416 --> 00:44.461
You said over the phone
you finished a new series
of paintings.

00:44.502 --> 00:45.712
That's the only
reason I'm here.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.049
Let's get to it, then.

00:51.384 --> 00:52.677
[sighs]

00:53.970 --> 00:57.182
Welcome to my little
night gallery,

00:57.223 --> 00:58.516
I like to call it,

01:00.185 --> 01:02.353
where the depths
of the human psyche
are plumbed,

01:02.395 --> 01:05.565
and all manner of nightmares
are summoned up and
bound to canvas.

01:05.607 --> 01:08.443
I'm sensing,
Goya... Dali... Bacon?

01:09.319 --> 01:10.320
My heroes.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.530
Tell me about this one.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.576
Ah, yes.

01:16.618 --> 01:22.373
It's about a hero haunted
by his past and plagued
by the trauma of his present.

01:28.421 --> 01:34.677
Uh, my nightmares have
been so vivid, Dr. Winters,

01:34.719 --> 01:40.809
but confusing too. I mean,
everything's jumbled up.

01:40.850 --> 01:42.185
That's your subconscious,

01:42.227 --> 01:44.062
trying to make sense
of the senseless.

01:45.021 --> 01:47.148
Your anxiety is normal,

01:47.190 --> 01:50.026
given the trauma you went
through. We can easily get
it under control

01:50.068 --> 01:51.694
with some,
anti-anxiety medication.

01:51.736 --> 01:53.780
No, no, no pills.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.824
[Dr. Winters] Okay, no pills.

01:55.865 --> 02:01.329
You know, there are other ways
of dealing with anxiety,
like EMDR.

02:01.371 --> 02:04.791
Eye movement, desensitization
and reprogramming.

02:04.833 --> 02:07.210
You tell the story
of what happened to you,

02:07.252 --> 02:10.880
while I move my hand
back and forth like this.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.924
You follow my fingers
with your eyes,

02:12.966 --> 02:16.177
so that, as you remember,
your body stays in the present.

02:16.970 --> 02:17.929
Should we try it?

02:19.556 --> 02:23.726
[suspenseful music playing]

02:26.729 --> 02:31.067
Private Butler.
We called him Bingo.

02:39.033 --> 02:39.993
I...

02:44.956 --> 02:45.915
I let him die.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.337
He was caught in No Man's Land.

02:54.799 --> 02:57.343
I was in a foxhole with
Jackson, who was bleeding out.

02:59.679 --> 03:00.555
[sniffles]

03:03.725 --> 03:06.352
Repetition takes power
away from the memory.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.271
Tell me the story again.

03:11.983 --> 03:13.359
[Archie] I got to admit.

03:13.401 --> 03:15.236
You were right
about Dr Winters, Eric.

03:15.278 --> 03:16.696
[Eric] Yeah, she's a friggin'
miracle worker.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.281
[Frank] You doing
EMDR with her as well?

03:18.323 --> 03:20.450
Nah, the doc's got me
on this drug regimen.

03:20.491 --> 03:21.993
The meds will help
with the nerve pain.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.495
-What about side effects?
-Nothing too serious.

03:24.537 --> 03:25.705
[knocking at door]

03:32.712 --> 03:34.923
No.

03:34.964 --> 03:38.176
Gentlemen, I've only recently
learned what everyone else
in town seems

03:38.218 --> 03:40.803
to have known for weeks,
if not months.

03:40.845 --> 03:42.847
That allegedly,
the largest deposit

03:42.889 --> 03:46.184
of palladium on this continent
sits beneath my maple groves.

03:46.226 --> 03:50.521
Which is why I need
a team of brawny strongmen
to reopen my mines,

03:50.563 --> 03:53.608
and harvest the precious metal
before Hiram Lodge steals it.

03:53.650 --> 03:57.612
So naturally, I thought of you
and Andrews Construction.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.572
Cheryl, I don't have
any experience mining.

03:59.614 --> 04:01.824
Archie, you've been a soldier.

04:01.866 --> 04:06.537
a fireman, a football coach,
a teacher and a bounty hunter.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.414
Is a miner so far
outside your purview?

04:08.456 --> 04:10.041
If it's opening up
existing mines,
that's doable.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.376
Hmm.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.252
I ran a crew in Alaska
for a spell.

04:14.837 --> 04:17.590
Okay. Count us in.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.550
We'll set up one of my dad's
old construction trailers

04:19.592 --> 04:21.636
and run the whole operation
from there.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.681
Perfection. And can you start,
oh, immediately?

04:27.684 --> 04:29.519
[Archie]
Ready to do this, boys?

04:29.560 --> 04:31.980
[Reggie] Hell yeah,
I can smell the palladium
from here.

04:32.021 --> 04:35.900
[Cheryl] Halt! Before you
go forth, I would like to offer
my blessing as ministress.

04:35.942 --> 04:39.195
Please gather around
and join hands.

04:39.237 --> 04:42.991
[Fangs] You know, uh,
I'm not really religious.

04:43.032 --> 04:44.909
[Kevin]
Keep an open mind, Fangs.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.619
[Cheryl clears throat]

04:46.661 --> 04:49.747
To our brother Divine,
in entering this dark cavity,

04:49.789 --> 04:53.251
help keep our strapping
muckmen safe from
harm and danger.

04:53.293 --> 04:59.090
And let their great labors
lead to even greater riches.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.883
-Amen.
-[Miners] Amen.

05:00.925 --> 05:02.802
[Nana Blossom] Amen.

05:02.844 --> 05:03.928
[Cheryl] All right, in we go.

05:08.808 --> 05:09.684
[suspenseful music playing]

05:15.231 --> 05:19.027
-[Reggie] You okay, Andrews?
-[Archie] Yeah.

05:20.445 --> 05:21.321
Let's do this.

05:23.698 --> 05:24.866
[Frank snoring]

05:32.707 --> 05:34.334
Hey, where's Kev?

05:34.375 --> 05:36.210
He said he wasn't hungry,
so he just kept on digging.

05:36.252 --> 05:37.170
What?

05:37.879 --> 05:39.130
No.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.423
No one works
in the mines alone.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.054
[thudding]

05:46.804 --> 05:47.680
[Archie] Kevin!

05:51.684 --> 05:52.560
Kev, you in here?

05:55.980 --> 05:57.273
Kev?

05:57.315 --> 05:58.191
[clanking]

06:00.735 --> 06:01.611
Kev!

06:04.113 --> 06:04.989

06:07.617 --> 06:08.993

06:14.123 --> 06:15.375

06:15.416 --> 06:17.335
[Archie yells]

06:19.087 --> 06:21.589
-[Kevin] Archie!
-Kevin, you can't
stay back alone.

06:21.631 --> 06:22.590
Look what I found.

06:23.508 --> 06:24.384
[Archie pants]

06:30.098 --> 06:31.391
It's a maple miracle.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.394
Well done, Archie.

06:34.435 --> 06:37.188
I'd suggest a celebratory
toast, but I know you have
to get right back to it.

06:44.987 --> 06:46.572
[Dr. Winters] Another good
session, Archie.

06:48.366 --> 06:50.451
Dr. Winters.

06:50.493 --> 06:55.456
If I agreed to take
some drugs for my PTSD,

06:55.498 --> 06:57.333
What would you
prescribe me, exactly?

06:57.375 --> 07:01.129
A low dose of anti-anxiety
medication, as we discussed.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.755
Why, did something happen?

07:02.797 --> 07:04.757
A crazy flashback.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.509
I have a crew depending
on me now,

07:06.551 --> 07:08.302
so I can't get
squirrely on them.

07:10.721 --> 07:11.597
These will help.

07:17.687 --> 07:18.563
[suspenseful music playing]

07:21.732 --> 07:24.986
[Reggie] Have you guys
ever heard of "The Mothmen"?

07:25.027 --> 07:27.572
[Archie] Yeah.
Jug was investigating them.

07:27.613 --> 07:29.323
I saw some
of his sketches,

07:29.365 --> 07:31.200
but they're just a hoax, right?

07:31.242 --> 07:36.581
[Fangs] Maybe. There were some
stories from the truck drivers

07:36.622 --> 07:39.750
who worked in the mines
when they were open.

07:39.792 --> 07:46.424
And every so often,
they'd talk about these
humanoid creatures

07:46.466 --> 07:52.889
that lived underground
with big red eyes to absorb
as much light as possible.

07:52.930 --> 07:56.893
Not to mention,
they were cannibalistic.

07:56.934 --> 07:58.561
[Archie] Okay,
that's enough storytelling.

07:58.603 --> 07:59.604
Let's get back to work.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.071
[grunting]

08:13.618 --> 08:14.619
[man] Archie.

08:14.660 --> 08:15.536
[clanging]

08:18.122 --> 08:19.540
[grunting]

08:19.582 --> 08:21.083
Help me, Sarge.

08:29.258 --> 08:30.218
[Archie] Eric?

08:31.511 --> 08:34.347
Eric, are you okay, buddy?

08:35.932 --> 08:36.807
Eric?

08:40.228 --> 08:41.103
Hey!

08:42.188 --> 08:43.147
Are you okay?

08:44.941 --> 08:46.859
[Frank] Archie? You okay?

08:46.901 --> 08:48.903
You ran out of the mines
like a bat out of hell.
what's going on?

08:48.945 --> 08:50.905
Yeah, I'm fine. I just had to
get out of there for a second.

08:50.947 --> 08:53.866
-What happened?
-I'm fine, Uncle Frank.
[breathes heavily]

08:54.867 --> 08:57.203
[bangs shelf]

08:57.245 --> 09:01.040
Someone's messing with me.
Someone's messing with my head.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.626
[bangs door open]

09:03.668 --> 09:05.461
What were those pills
you gave me?

09:05.503 --> 09:07.255
Sergeant Andrews,
You can't burst in here
when I'm...

09:07.296 --> 09:08.881
[bangs desk]
What were those pills
you gave me, huh?

09:08.923 --> 09:12.843
Psychotics?
hallucinogenics? LSD?

09:12.885 --> 09:14.554
Whatever drugs she wants you
to take don't take them.

09:14.595 --> 09:15.930
She's experimenting on us.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.139
Who do you even work for?

09:17.181 --> 09:18.224
Who do you work for?

09:18.266 --> 09:19.684
Some government corporation?

09:19.725 --> 09:21.102
Well, let me guess...

09:21.143 --> 09:23.854
-It's Hiram Lodge.
-The rum-maker?

09:23.896 --> 09:25.565
Archie, I don't even
know that man.

09:25.606 --> 09:26.983
-You need to leave now.
-No, no no.

09:27.024 --> 09:28.109
[Dr. Winters] I'm gonna
call security.

09:28.150 --> 09:29.277
[Archie] What were those pills?

09:31.028 --> 09:34.532
-[man] You heard the doc.
-Fine.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.368
I'm gone.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.455
[door slams]

09:41.497 --> 09:43.332
-[Archie] Jackson!
-Yo!

09:43.374 --> 09:45.084
Jackson.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.044
You've got to stop seeing
Dr. Winters, okay?

09:47.086 --> 09:48.671
She's dangerous.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.339
What are you talking about?

09:50.381 --> 09:53.092
Eric, listen to me.
She's using us as guinea pigs.

09:54.927 --> 09:58.764
With all due respect,
I'm not going to
stop seeing Dr. Winters.

09:58.806 --> 10:00.766
And I don't think
you should either.

10:00.808 --> 10:02.435
You got a lot
of baggage to deal with, Sarge,

10:02.476 --> 10:05.271
more than you let on.
Losing that many men,

10:06.564 --> 10:07.857
that's not easy.

10:10.234 --> 10:11.527
I'm surprised
it didn't break you

10:25.625 --> 10:27.209
[door opens]

10:27.251 --> 10:28.544
[Frank] Hey, there he is.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.588
Hey, Uncle Frank.

10:30.630 --> 10:34.216
Uh, hey listen, Archie.
Me and the guys
were talking and uh,

10:34.258 --> 10:38.596
we think maybe you should
take the day off. Rest up,
just take your mind off things.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.265
Uncle Frank, I'm not
taking Dr. Winters'
meds anymore.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.267
They should be completely
flushed out of my system.

10:43.309 --> 10:47.271
Yeah, all the same.
I don't think you
should go underground.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.106
Look, if you want to do
something, maybe you could
get caught up

10:49.148 --> 10:51.025
on the payroll,
so we don't fall behind.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.318
We'll come back,
and have lunch together.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:54.362 --> 10:55.696

12:22.825 --> 12:24.452
Gas. It's gas.

12:24.493 --> 12:26.036
We gotta get everyone
topside ASAP.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.041
[Cheryl] Okay.
I want to hear straight from
the horse's mouths.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.334
What happened to your crew?

12:32.376 --> 12:33.878
Whyfor has the digging stopped?

12:33.919 --> 12:35.838
Cheryl, it's not safe
to work in your mines.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.590
[Frank] Given the state
of delirium most of the men
were in,

12:37.631 --> 12:39.759
I'm guessing those tunnels
are full of carbon monoxide.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.969
[Frank] It's an odorless gas.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.138
If you breathe enough of it,
it causes hallucinations,
violent outbursts.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.891
Yeah which all of us have been
experiencing to greater
or less degrees.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.100
That's annoying.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.811
How do we fix it?

12:50.853 --> 12:52.938
We can hook up
a pump to make sure
there's fresh air...

12:52.980 --> 12:54.690
Yes, do that.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.442
And in the meantime, I'll order
of flock of canaries,

12:56.484 --> 12:58.611
but I want you back
in there digging, ASAP.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.949
What are you
doing here, Archie?

13:03.991 --> 13:05.576
Dr. Winters, please.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.161
It turns out
I was suffering the effects

13:07.203 --> 13:08.829
of carbon monoxide poisoning,

13:08.871 --> 13:10.206
but I took my aggression
out on you,

13:10.247 --> 13:11.457
and for that, I'm sorry,

13:12.917 --> 13:15.127
But don't cut me loose, Doc.
I need help.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.879
I haven't told you this,
but a lot of men...

13:20.049 --> 13:22.802
a lot of men
died under my command,

13:22.843 --> 13:25.346
and at first I started seeing
one of them, Private Bingo.

13:25.387 --> 13:26.347
But now...

13:34.146 --> 13:36.690
Now I'm seeing all of them.

13:36.732 --> 13:39.693
I don't know what you
want me to say, Archie.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.405
I'm genuinely scared
to be alone with you

13:43.447 --> 13:45.574
after how you came in here
last time.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.326
And if you're
truly experiencing

13:47.368 --> 13:49.870
such an extreme level
of hallucination,

13:49.912 --> 13:53.040
then I don't think
it's safe for you

13:53.082 --> 13:54.708
to be around anyone right now.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.304
-[thunderclap]
-[Minerva] These paintings,
Cheryl.

14:07.346 --> 14:10.015
Your subject matter's somehow

14:10.057 --> 14:11.684
even more haunted than before.

14:11.725 --> 14:14.103
Thank you, Minerva.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.106
My God.

14:17.147 --> 14:21.110
Inspired by my poor dear cousin
wrestling with the question.

14:21.151 --> 14:23.404
"Who is the true monster?"

14:23.445 --> 14:26.866
The ghoul our girl is hunting,
or the girl herself?

14:34.915 --> 14:37.877
Look, I'm not as used
to this kind of thing
as you are,

14:37.918 --> 14:41.213
but we just caught a man
who might be
the Highway Killer.

14:41.255 --> 14:44.049
Are you sure
we shouldn't hand him
over to proper authorities?

14:44.091 --> 14:47.636
If we do that, I could get
cut out of the investigation.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.346
This guy might have
killed Polly.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.432
I know I could get that
information out of him.

14:51.473 --> 14:52.558
It is what I do,

14:55.603 --> 14:57.980
but I think it's time
you bow out, Tabitha.

14:58.022 --> 14:59.982
Just let me handle this,
all right?

15:00.024 --> 15:01.984
-Wait, are you serious?
-Deadly.

15:03.527 --> 15:04.570
Please trust me.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.115
Okay.

15:08.157 --> 15:12.786
But if at any point
you need backup, I'm here.

15:12.828 --> 15:15.247
I don't want
any other girls dying.

15:15.289 --> 15:17.041
And that includes you.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.587
Yeah.

15:28.010 --> 15:28.969
[groans]

15:32.723 --> 15:35.184
Hi, I'm Betty.

15:37.436 --> 15:38.395
What's your name?

15:41.315 --> 15:42.274
Martin.

15:45.235 --> 15:47.404
No, it's not.
That's not your name.

15:47.446 --> 15:50.532
That's the name
on the driver's license
you've been carrying around.

15:50.574 --> 15:56.372
But the real Martin Tucker
died almost 50 years ago.
I'm with the FBI.

15:56.413 --> 15:58.958
So you should
really start telling me

15:58.999 --> 16:01.877
about the women you've killed
along the Lonely Highway.

16:03.796 --> 16:04.797
All of them.

16:04.838 --> 16:06.882
If you're with the FBI,

16:06.924 --> 16:12.012
then why am I in some
shop class instead of in jail
right now?

16:12.054 --> 16:13.430
I want a phone call.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.641
I am a citizen
of the United States.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.101
-I have rights.
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.436
Well, actually, you're not

16:19.478 --> 16:21.188
in the United States anymore.

16:23.899 --> 16:25.109
You're in Riverdale.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.362
Welcome.

16:28.404 --> 16:33.200
And killers of women
do not have rights.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.953
And if you're thinking of
yelling for help,

16:36.996 --> 16:38.247
it's a long weekend.

16:39.289 --> 16:40.666
Let me guess.

16:40.708 --> 16:43.085
You're one of those women
who runs around

16:43.127 --> 16:45.421
entrapping men,
and gets off on it.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.507
Who hurt you?

16:48.549 --> 16:49.800
A bitter boyfriend?

16:52.886 --> 16:53.846
[screaming]

16:56.765 --> 16:59.143
Okay, well, I'll be back.

16:59.184 --> 17:02.730
Maybe next time
we can have a more
fruitful conversation.

17:02.771 --> 17:07.151
If not, I guess I'll just
have to get creative.

17:22.291 --> 17:25.502
Mary Catherine Avery,
last seen two years ago

17:25.544 --> 17:28.672
waiting tables at a diner
in Seaside.

17:28.714 --> 17:32.217
Nicole Houston
went missing a year ago
while hitchhiking to Canada.

17:39.099 --> 17:42.186
Polly Cooper
last seen this past summer.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.526
Mmm. I thought I recognized her
for a second,

17:49.568 --> 17:51.111
but no, I was mistaken.

17:55.032 --> 17:56.158
Allison McCall.

17:58.660 --> 18:01.830
It's been a minute,
but I never forget
a face that pretty.

18:01.872 --> 18:04.500
-[groans]
-Where is she?

18:04.541 --> 18:08.420
There's an old hikers' trail
in the northeast corner
of Soweto Swamp.

18:08.462 --> 18:11.048
She's underneath
the gorgeous
sycamore tree.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.466
You just gotta dig.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.552
So did you find her?

18:15.594 --> 18:17.179
She's a real bitch, isn't she?

18:17.221 --> 18:20.557
[grunts] They're dog bones,
you psychopath.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.476
Oh, right.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.895
That's where
I buried my old dog
after she passed away.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.355
Poor little thing.

18:26.396 --> 18:29.191
Sorry about the confusion,
Agent Cooper.

18:30.484 --> 18:31.985
How do you know my name?

18:32.027 --> 18:34.613
There's been stories
up and down the highway

18:34.655 --> 18:38.784
about some crazy
rogue FBI agent
out looking for her sister.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.328
-[groans]
-Polly.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.496
Where is she?

18:42.538 --> 18:45.833
If I knew and if I told you,

18:45.874 --> 18:47.334
you'd be like
every other woman

18:47.376 --> 18:49.670
casting me aside
after getting what you want.

18:50.796 --> 18:51.755
Fine.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.469
Let's talk about
something else.

18:57.511 --> 19:00.681
Why did you start doing this?

19:00.722 --> 19:03.100
-I wanted to see
how it would feel.
-And?

19:06.228 --> 19:07.604
How does it feel?

19:07.646 --> 19:09.857
No different from
hunting with my family.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.235
These, uh...

19:13.277 --> 19:19.324
These people
that you're hunting
aren't animals.

19:20.659 --> 19:23.412
They're human beings
with families.

19:23.453 --> 19:25.247
No, they're just prey.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.000
That's how I see it.

19:38.302 --> 19:39.261
[door closes]

19:39.845 --> 19:40.804
Mom.

19:42.681 --> 19:43.891
I have to tell you something.

19:44.850 --> 19:45.809
What is it, honey?

19:48.020 --> 19:52.983
I captured a trucker.

19:53.025 --> 19:56.153
I think he's the man
who may have killed Polly,

19:56.195 --> 19:58.739
the man who's been killing
all the young women
on the highway.

19:58.780 --> 19:59.990
Oh, my God.

20:01.950 --> 20:07.122
One thing serial killers do

20:07.164 --> 20:09.750
is dehumanize their victims
before killing them.

20:09.791 --> 20:14.254
It's risky, Mom, but I believe
that if he saw you,

20:14.296 --> 20:17.674
really saw you
as a grieving mother

20:17.716 --> 20:19.760
and Polly as a human being...

20:22.804 --> 20:25.724
he might confess.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.517
There's no guarantees,
but maybe.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.146
I'll do it.

20:31.188 --> 20:32.189
Okay, good.

20:35.567 --> 20:36.526
Okay.

20:41.740 --> 20:42.658
I want to tell you
about my daughter Polly.

20:46.119 --> 20:49.915
This was her at ten years old,
my little golden girl.

20:53.794 --> 20:57.005
She loved to dance and swim.

20:57.047 --> 20:58.674
She was a baton twirler.

21:01.134 --> 21:03.178
You can't imagine

21:03.220 --> 21:05.973
what it's like to be a mother

21:06.014 --> 21:08.600
that has no idea
where her child is.

21:13.855 --> 21:14.856
Your...

21:17.192 --> 21:18.277
Your daughter?

21:18.318 --> 21:19.278
Yeah?

21:21.280 --> 21:24.533
Your daughter
squealed like a pig
when I slit her throat.

21:24.574 --> 21:26.952
[screams] You monster!

21:29.621 --> 21:30.622
Hey, hey!

21:30.664 --> 21:31.665
Please.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.085
-[screaming]
-Mom, stop.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.090
We're not
getting through to him.

21:40.882 --> 21:42.384
Have to push harder.

21:42.426 --> 21:45.053
Okay. Appealing to his
humanity didn't work.

21:47.180 --> 21:51.226
But maybe if he believed
that he was actually
going to die,

21:51.268 --> 21:53.312
maybe then he would talk.

21:53.353 --> 21:54.688
Why don't you
just kill him, Betty?

21:57.524 --> 21:58.984
Mom, come on.

21:59.026 --> 22:01.528
That scumbag
killed my daughter.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.405
That's not going
to make you feel any better.

22:03.447 --> 22:05.574
I'll feel better knowing that
my daughter's killer's dead.

22:06.908 --> 22:08.118
So do it, Betty.

22:09.536 --> 22:11.705
As your mother,
I give you permission.

22:12.706 --> 22:13.957
Kill that monster.

22:18.628 --> 22:20.339
I want to try
one more thing first.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.636
I know my sister's dead.

22:28.680 --> 22:29.723
I've accepted that.

22:31.016 --> 22:33.685
So I'm asking you one more time

22:33.727 --> 22:35.604
to tell me where Polly is.

22:37.939 --> 22:39.358
Please.

22:39.399 --> 22:41.526
There's no earthly reason
for me to do that.

22:46.114 --> 22:47.074
Okay, then.

22:50.994 --> 22:53.747
Here's what's
going to happen next.

22:53.789 --> 22:58.251
I'm not going to kill you
because I want you to suffer,

22:58.293 --> 23:02.214
so I'm going to start
carving pieces off of you.

23:04.299 --> 23:08.929
First, I'll use a chainsaw
on your feet.

23:08.970 --> 23:11.723
I'll cut them off at the ankles
and then cauterize the wounds.

23:11.765 --> 23:13.308
Uh-huh.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.852
And then I'll cut off your legs
at the knees,

23:16.978 --> 23:19.398
cauterize those wounds,

23:19.439 --> 23:22.401
and then your upper legs
at the groin.

23:22.442 --> 23:26.154
Then we'll move on
to your hands,
sever them at the wrists,

23:26.196 --> 23:28.198
and by that point,
you might die of
a heart attack.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.741
But I don't know,

23:31.284 --> 23:33.453
you seem pretty strong,

23:33.495 --> 23:35.747
and I have a couple tricks
up my sleeve.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.377
Wait. Okay, wait.

23:45.715 --> 23:48.093
Did your sister have blue eyes

23:48.135 --> 23:50.137
and a tattoo
of the infinity symbol?

23:50.178 --> 23:53.890
And did she ever go
by the name Patty
instead of Polly?

23:56.643 --> 23:57.644
Yeah.

24:00.355 --> 24:01.356
Do you remember her?

24:04.776 --> 24:06.361
Not in the least.

24:12.993 --> 24:13.994
[breathing heavily]

24:18.832 --> 24:20.333
Please.

24:20.375 --> 24:21.585
Just kill me.

24:22.586 --> 24:24.421
Just kill me. Please.

24:25.547 --> 24:28.884
You're a tiny, pretty thing.

24:28.925 --> 24:31.470
I'm not going to kill you.

24:31.511 --> 24:35.348
I'm gonna carve pieces
off of you.

24:35.390 --> 24:38.768
First, I'll use the chainsaw
on your feet.

24:40.770 --> 24:44.191
And I'll cauterize the wounds.

25:07.130 --> 25:10.217
So, Betty, did you do it?

25:11.468 --> 25:12.469
Nope.

25:13.303 --> 25:15.263
But he did it himself.

25:15.305 --> 25:17.098
Bit off his own tongue,

25:18.475 --> 25:19.476
swallowed it,

25:20.810 --> 25:23.188
and choked to death on it.

25:23.230 --> 25:25.440
Maybe he was afraid of
what I was going to do to him.

25:25.482 --> 25:28.235
Or maybe he finally felt guilty
about what he'd done.

25:29.778 --> 25:32.239
So he takes his secrets
to the grave,

25:32.280 --> 25:34.574
and we're no closer to
finding Polly.

25:34.616 --> 25:37.536
We'll have to wait and see
what Dr. Curdle's
autopsy report says.

25:39.329 --> 25:42.958
Do you feel better
now that he's dead?

25:46.378 --> 25:47.796
I do.

25:47.837 --> 25:49.673
I think some lives
were saved tonight.

25:51.091 --> 25:52.133
Do you feel better?

25:54.386 --> 25:55.387
Yeah.

25:56.471 --> 25:58.098
But based on a few things
he said,

25:58.139 --> 26:02.018
my gut's telling me
that he's not the only killer.

26:02.060 --> 26:05.855
I think maybe there's a family
of them hunting together.

26:18.910 --> 26:19.828
[thunderclap]

26:20.495 --> 26:21.496
[Minerva] My God.

26:21.538 --> 26:23.873
it's remarkable, isn't it?

26:23.915 --> 26:28.295
Portrait of a young writer,
caught betwixt
fact and fiction,

26:28.336 --> 26:30.088
memory and madness,

26:30.130 --> 26:31.673
truth and trauma.

26:31.715 --> 26:33.883
Interpret it for me.

26:33.925 --> 26:36.261
Let's just say
it's about the stories

26:36.303 --> 26:40.181
we tell ourselves to survive
and about addiction.

26:43.518 --> 26:45.353
[man] Would anyone new
like to start us off?

26:49.691 --> 26:52.944
Uh, yeah, sure.

26:52.986 --> 26:59.242
Uh, my name is
Forsythe Pendleton Jones III.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.119
[all] Welcome, Forsythe.

27:01.161 --> 27:02.829
It's just kind of weird being
in here at night.

27:02.871 --> 27:05.290
Not-- Not as a teacher,
but as a...

27:07.792 --> 27:09.961
an alcoholic.

27:10.003 --> 27:12.172
We're happy to listen
to whatever you want to say.

27:13.548 --> 27:14.966
I guess I'll start.

27:15.008 --> 27:17.677
When I left Riverdale
after high school,

27:17.719 --> 27:20.347
I joined
the Iowa Writer's Workshop.

27:20.388 --> 27:22.140
Now I thought Iowa was
going to be an escape.

27:22.182 --> 27:24.476
But in reality,
my freshman year

27:24.517 --> 27:26.645
was actually kind of boring.

27:27.729 --> 27:30.982
So I focused on my craft,

27:31.024 --> 27:32.692
the origins of
storytelling stuff

27:32.734 --> 27:37.280
like Greek myths, Dostoyevsky,
The Sopranos.

27:37.322 --> 27:40.325
And every afternoon
at dusk, I'd segue

27:40.367 --> 27:44.120
from coffee to whiskey
and I'd start writing.

27:44.162 --> 27:46.998
And from those late nights
came the first few chapters

27:47.040 --> 27:50.543
of a novel, and I hoped
my ticket out of Iowa.

27:50.585 --> 27:52.545
So I polished the pages
and I sent them off to like

27:52.587 --> 27:54.464
a hundred literary agents
in New York.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.842
And one got back to me,

27:57.884 --> 27:59.511
a guy named Samm Pansky.

27:59.552 --> 28:01.680
He was an old school legend
and he wrote,

28:01.721 --> 28:05.642
"Hey, kid,
drop me a line next time
you're in New York."

28:05.684 --> 28:07.977
So I took Samm up on his offer.

28:10.105 --> 28:11.523
Based on what I've read,

28:12.565 --> 28:13.817
you got a lot of talent, kid.

28:16.861 --> 28:17.904
I got you something.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.785
-What's this for?
-What?

28:23.827 --> 28:25.537
An agent can't
get his client a gift?

28:27.038 --> 28:28.081
Wait...

28:28.748 --> 28:29.708
I have an agent?

28:29.749 --> 28:30.709
Are you my agent?

28:32.460 --> 28:34.421
Welcome to the
Samm Pansky family.

28:34.462 --> 28:35.463
[chuckles]

28:35.505 --> 28:36.464
[phone line ringing]

28:36.506 --> 28:38.007
Hey, Betty.

28:38.049 --> 28:40.301
Oh, uh, I'm surprised
you picked up.

28:40.343 --> 28:44.806
My roommate
has some company over,
so I'm just killing time.

28:44.848 --> 28:47.308
Yeah, that's-- That's rough.

28:47.350 --> 28:51.980
Um, I got an agent.

28:52.021 --> 28:53.440
Yeah. He signed me
after reading,

28:53.481 --> 28:55.316
like, two chapters
of my new novel.

28:55.358 --> 28:56.776
Jug, that's huge.

28:56.818 --> 28:58.653
Congratulations.

28:58.695 --> 29:00.780
Please tell me you're Iowa
friends are taking you out

29:00.822 --> 29:02.198
for a celebratory drink.

29:04.200 --> 29:07.120
Yeah, uh, they are. But later.

29:07.162 --> 29:08.705
[Jughead] And that night,
I decided

29:08.747 --> 29:10.373
that I was gonna
move to New York City

29:10.415 --> 29:13.418
and become a proper writer.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.170
In my new apartment
in the East Village

29:15.211 --> 29:17.839
I was hit with a lethal case
of writer's block.

29:20.508 --> 29:22.510
Luckily, my girlfriend Jessica

29:22.552 --> 29:25.346
knew where to score
some maple mushrooms.

29:25.388 --> 29:26.514
-Do you have it?
-[Jess] Yeah.

29:26.556 --> 29:27.682
Perfect timing.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.192
I was tripping on shrooms...

29:38.359 --> 29:39.861
It just...

29:39.903 --> 29:45.909
It felt like, doors to my mind
swung right open.

29:45.950 --> 29:48.036
I wrote 200
pages that night.

29:49.537 --> 29:52.999
From that crazy
raw first draft

29:53.041 --> 29:54.334
came the "The Outcasts."

29:59.255 --> 30:00.215
Well...

30:03.259 --> 30:05.762
I think the "The Outcasts"

30:07.597 --> 30:10.725
is going to be
a monster YA hit.

30:10.767 --> 30:13.686
And let me tell you, YA is hot,
which means moolah.

30:13.728 --> 30:14.813
Lots of moolah.

30:15.605 --> 30:17.440
YA it is.

30:17.482 --> 30:20.527
The year leading up
to the publication of the book

30:20.568 --> 30:24.572
was just a whirlwind.

30:24.614 --> 30:27.951
I was drinking pretty steadily.
And though Jess had moved in,

30:27.992 --> 30:30.495
I was still holding on
to the past.

30:33.581 --> 30:36.543
Or more specifically, my ex.

30:51.266 --> 30:52.809
[Jughead] Spoiler alert.

30:52.851 --> 30:56.354
It was not a great night. No.

30:56.396 --> 31:01.484
It quickly began to derail
after I got a call from Betty

31:01.526 --> 31:06.072
saying she wasn't going to be
able to make the book release
after all.

31:10.827 --> 31:13.913
Stumbling in the general
direction of my party,

31:13.955 --> 31:20.211
I called Betty and I left her
just this crazy,
super toxic voicemail.

31:20.253 --> 31:21.629
[recorded voice of Betty]
leave a message

31:21.671 --> 31:24.340
Betty, of course you bailed.

31:24.382 --> 31:26.301
You've been blowing me off
for years.

31:26.342 --> 31:28.845
Why should I have even expected
anything different?

31:28.887 --> 31:31.723
I see you, Betty. I see now,

31:31.764 --> 31:35.351
what I should have seen
seven years ago.

31:35.393 --> 31:37.729
So you pretend to be nice,

31:37.770 --> 31:42.150
but really, you're just looking
for weak spots.

31:44.319 --> 31:46.571
And when you find them,

31:46.613 --> 31:49.741
you just press on them
like a bruise.

31:49.782 --> 31:51.200
Like when you hooked up
with Archie.

31:51.242 --> 31:55.914
You really found the one person

31:55.955 --> 31:57.916
that would hurt Veronica
and I the most.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.002
And you just went there.

32:01.044 --> 32:05.632
You're a cold, fake,
duplicitous bitch.

32:05.673 --> 32:09.135
And when people read my book,
everyone is gonna see that.

32:19.520 --> 32:20.521
And then

32:21.648 --> 32:23.024
I vanished.

32:23.066 --> 32:24.734
I was swallowed up by the dark.

32:29.822 --> 32:30.823
So, "swallowed up
by the dark,"

32:30.865 --> 32:33.117
was that a metaphor?

32:33.159 --> 32:34.535
[Jughead] No, I wish.

32:34.577 --> 32:36.788
One moment I was stumbling
in a back alley,

32:36.829 --> 32:42.293
in the next moment I was
waking up in a hospital room.

32:50.468 --> 32:51.469
Where am I?

32:54.055 --> 32:57.100
Hey, hey, you're okay.

32:59.060 --> 33:00.353
You're at St. Vincent's.

33:02.188 --> 33:03.940
You went on a bender, Jones.

33:04.857 --> 33:06.401
An epic one.

33:06.442 --> 33:07.568
Hell happened?

33:10.446 --> 33:12.115
Actually, I don't wanna know.

33:13.324 --> 33:14.826
How long was I out?

33:14.867 --> 33:15.910
A few days.

33:16.869 --> 33:19.914
Oh, my God...

33:19.956 --> 33:22.375
[Jughead] I wish I could say
that that signaled
a fresh start

33:22.417 --> 33:23.292
for Jess and I,

33:23.334 --> 33:25.336
but no, no.

33:25.378 --> 33:27.505
We kept on drinking
and fighting

33:28.589 --> 33:29.674
and certainly not writing.

33:29.716 --> 33:31.634
[cellphone ringing]

33:31.676 --> 33:35.263
So when my old pal
Archie Andrews
called out of the blue,

33:35.304 --> 33:38.641
l came home,
here, to Riverdale.

33:38.683 --> 33:41.561
But something was
still gnawing at me,

33:41.602 --> 33:44.856
at my mind, at my sanity.

33:44.897 --> 33:47.734
And I was still drinking,
heavily, heavily.

33:49.152 --> 33:51.863
And shortly after that,
I hit rock bottom,

33:51.904 --> 33:54.032
on skid row, no less.

33:54.073 --> 33:57.577
Then I figured I needed
to go back to New York City.

33:57.618 --> 33:58.703
Try and find out
what happened to me

33:58.745 --> 34:00.204
the night of my book release,

34:00.246 --> 34:03.458
when I lost
those days of my life.

34:03.499 --> 34:05.543
So I went back
to St Vincent's Hospital,

34:05.585 --> 34:07.628
requested a copy
of my discharge record,

34:07.670 --> 34:11.257
which said I had been treated
for a rabies infection,

34:11.299 --> 34:13.009
so I went to see Jess.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.011
Rabies?

34:15.053 --> 34:16.888
What the hell happened? Jess?

34:17.555 --> 34:19.265
Just tell me.

34:19.307 --> 34:21.809
You disappeared the night
of your book release party.

34:21.851 --> 34:24.270
And three days later,
you ended up at St Vincent's.

34:24.312 --> 34:27.190
The doctor said
that when you came in,
you were out of your mind

34:27.231 --> 34:28.483
raving and ranting.

34:29.358 --> 34:30.777
About what?

34:30.818 --> 34:33.738
And she told me
that I had been yelling

34:33.780 --> 34:36.574
about a Rat King.

34:38.367 --> 34:40.369
A man...

34:40.411 --> 34:43.539
that lived underneath
the streets of New York City.

34:43.581 --> 34:45.500
Wait. I'm sorry.

34:45.541 --> 34:46.751
Uh, a what?

34:46.793 --> 34:48.169
Yeah, no, let me explain.

34:48.211 --> 34:50.254
Um...

34:50.296 --> 34:52.548
the night of my book release,

34:52.590 --> 34:54.634
I never even made it
to the party.

34:54.675 --> 34:57.428
I mean, moments after I left
that voicemail for Betty,

34:57.470 --> 35:03.351
I fell down a sinkhole
that had opened up
in the pavement.

35:03.392 --> 35:05.645
Yeah, it's rare,
but I guess it happens.

35:07.897 --> 35:10.566
There must've been
some impulse
in me to just vanish,

35:10.608 --> 35:12.777
walk away
from the shambles of my life,

35:12.819 --> 35:16.864
because I thought to myself
"I could stay here."

35:16.906 --> 35:19.742
So I pushed together
a couple of crates,

35:19.784 --> 35:23.538
and formed this kind of cot
and I tried to sleep.

35:23.579 --> 35:27.125
But that is when he showed up.

35:29.418 --> 35:30.586
Who are you?

35:33.798 --> 35:36.050
-Samm?
-I'm the king
of the underworld.

35:38.553 --> 35:40.263
And you are a trespasser here.

35:42.557 --> 35:43.432
No! No!

35:43.474 --> 35:46.310
What good are you?

35:46.352 --> 35:48.020
What do you even do?

35:48.062 --> 35:52.525
I'm a writer, I tell stories.

35:54.485 --> 35:57.321
I can tell you a story.
Let me tell you a story.

35:59.699 --> 36:02.743
All right. Go ahead.

36:06.414 --> 36:08.374
Tell me a story.

36:08.416 --> 36:12.170
Now luckily I had a copy
of my book
"The Outcasts" on me.

36:12.211 --> 36:13.796
So I read it aloud.

36:14.964 --> 36:17.925
And the Rat King ate it up.

36:17.967 --> 36:19.260
[scoffs]

36:19.302 --> 36:21.804
[Rat King clapping]

36:21.846 --> 36:24.599
Wow! That's what
I'm talking about.

36:24.640 --> 36:26.350
You're a born storyteller.

36:26.392 --> 36:28.811
Because of that, I want you
to stay down here with me.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.479
Where you'll regale me
with your tales.

36:30.521 --> 36:31.814
That sounds great.

36:31.856 --> 36:34.192
I'll come back
for you tomorrow.

36:34.233 --> 36:36.194
When everything will be
prepared for your arrival.

36:36.235 --> 36:37.737
There,

36:37.778 --> 36:42.158
away from the responsibilities
and expectations,

36:42.200 --> 36:45.745
deadlines and dead-end
relationships

36:45.786 --> 36:49.790
I was very eager to join
the Rat King's domain.

36:52.627 --> 36:55.546
But that night
she came to visit me.

36:55.588 --> 36:58.549
Jughead. Jughead, wake up.

37:00.343 --> 37:03.512
Betty, what the hell?
What are you doing here?

37:03.554 --> 37:05.723
I'm saving you.
You're in danger.

37:05.765 --> 37:07.350
You need to get out of here
right now.

37:07.391 --> 37:09.518
"Danger." What you mean?

37:09.560 --> 37:11.938
Jughead, listen to me.
The city floods the sewer
once every two weeks.

37:11.979 --> 37:13.356
That's happening
any minute, okay?

37:13.397 --> 37:14.982
If you stay down here,
you will drown.

37:16.025 --> 37:17.026
Come with me.

37:22.031 --> 37:23.491
Betty walked behind me,

37:25.201 --> 37:27.828
urging me through
those dark tunnels.

37:27.870 --> 37:30.915
It was a lot
like that Greek myth
of Orpheus and Euridice.

37:30.957 --> 37:34.669
The two young lovers
try to escape
the underworld together.

37:34.710 --> 37:38.923
Well, somehow, I made it
to the light,

37:38.965 --> 37:40.466
and to civilization,

37:42.301 --> 37:44.679
some back alley
in East Village.

37:45.513 --> 37:46.597
I was dirty.

37:46.639 --> 37:48.724
I was just out of my mind.

37:48.766 --> 37:52.103
I was also infected,
which I didn't know
at the time.

37:52.144 --> 37:54.397
So the cops found me.

37:54.438 --> 37:55.982
They picked me up
and they took me
to St Vincent's Hospital.

37:58.985 --> 38:01.779
Betty saved me in the darkness.

38:01.821 --> 38:04.073
Like she had
so many times before.

38:10.579 --> 38:14.000
So how much
of what you told us was true?

38:14.041 --> 38:15.835
That's a good question.

38:15.876 --> 38:18.921
Well, when Jess told me what
I told her at the hospital,

38:18.963 --> 38:22.925
I felt that I needed to return

38:22.967 --> 38:25.845
to the physical site
of that core trauma,

38:26.554 --> 38:28.764
the darkness.

38:28.806 --> 38:31.517
It took me two days,
but I found the alley,

38:33.227 --> 38:36.981
a sinkhole
that was now paved over.

38:37.023 --> 38:39.775
Next to it, there was a sewer
grate which I pried open.

38:41.736 --> 38:43.112
And I entered the abyss.

38:46.907 --> 38:48.617
It was definitely familiar.

38:52.288 --> 38:54.290
I'd absolutely been there.

38:56.625 --> 38:59.879
Confirmed when
I found a copy of my book.

39:02.423 --> 39:04.050
Scribbled in the margins

39:04.091 --> 39:06.510
was the story of the Rat King
and his captive

39:06.552 --> 39:09.221
that I completely made up.

39:09.263 --> 39:11.390
Going to the source
of my trauma

39:11.432 --> 39:13.684
made me understand
that the Rat King
was just a fiction

39:13.726 --> 39:15.311
I had conjured
to distract myself

39:15.353 --> 39:16.979
from what really happened
down there.

39:19.440 --> 39:23.569
The night of my book launch,
I was angry,

39:25.363 --> 39:27.656
drunk.

39:27.698 --> 39:31.786
And I fell into a sinkhole
and I lost consciousness.

39:31.827 --> 39:34.330
And when I came to,
I couldn't scream for help

39:34.372 --> 39:36.332
because I was covered in rats.

39:36.374 --> 39:39.168
[rats squeaking]

39:39.210 --> 39:44.173
I was afraid that if I opened
my mouth they would
crawl into it.

39:44.215 --> 39:47.385
That's so... It's horrible.

39:48.636 --> 39:51.013
The worst part was that,

39:51.055 --> 39:55.643
the whole event
just made me realize
how alone I was.

39:56.727 --> 39:57.812
You know?

39:59.522 --> 40:00.898
Like, that night
was supposed to be

40:00.940 --> 40:03.025
one of my greatest triumphs,

40:03.067 --> 40:05.361
and I was in a dark hole,

40:05.403 --> 40:07.988
literally and existentially.

40:12.660 --> 40:13.702
And no one...

40:15.413 --> 40:16.914
Like, no one missed me,

40:17.581 --> 40:18.541
at all.

40:20.709 --> 40:23.003
And that's what
I'm dealing with now.

40:24.713 --> 40:26.799
Just the wreckage of my life.

40:29.593 --> 40:32.430
Step one is I need to get
my drinking under control.

40:33.472 --> 40:34.849
That's why I'm here.

40:34.890 --> 40:36.142
And we're glad you are.

40:37.810 --> 40:39.061
Thank you for your share.

40:40.938 --> 40:43.524
All right, so who's next?

40:47.278 --> 40:52.908
Well. A truly masterful
showing, Cheryl.

40:52.950 --> 40:54.743
I hope you know,
I didn't just bring you here

40:54.785 --> 40:57.329
for the paintings, Minerva.

40:57.371 --> 41:00.040
Although, there
is one more piece

41:00.082 --> 41:02.626
I'd love to show you.

41:02.668 --> 41:04.336
I painted us as...

41:06.922 --> 41:10.676
Psyche revived by Cupid's Kiss.

41:10.718 --> 41:12.136
It's gorgeous.

41:13.512 --> 41:14.638
Do you love it?

41:17.266 --> 41:18.726
Cheryl, the last time
I was here,

41:18.767 --> 41:21.103
your Nana suggested
sacrificing me

41:21.145 --> 41:22.688
to an angry eldritch terror.

41:24.315 --> 41:26.775
Are you saying
you feel nothing Min-Min?

41:29.153 --> 41:32.323
Look, I do love...the painting.

41:32.364 --> 41:36.535
And despite our last encounter,
I still have feelings for you.

41:36.577 --> 41:37.870
But I'm about
to leave the country

41:37.912 --> 41:40.164
on an art buying trip
to South Africa.

41:40.206 --> 41:41.332
In the morning?

41:41.373 --> 41:43.292
Yes, I'm afraid so.

41:43.334 --> 41:46.921
Well, that still leaves us
with tonight, doesn't it?

41:47.838 --> 41:48.881
Yes.
