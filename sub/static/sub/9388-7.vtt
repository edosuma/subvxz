00:34.952 --> 00:36.189
Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker

00:36.249 --> 00:38.225
with a Channel Five News
Special Report.

00:38.257 --> 00:39.651
And I'm Diane Simmons.

00:39.772 --> 00:41.297
A flash flood warning
is in effect

00:41.369 --> 00:43.616
as rain continues
to pound Rhode Island.

00:43.677 --> 00:45.941
Let's go to Asian reporter
Tricia Takanawa,

00:46.067 --> 00:48.907
Who's gonna tell us
all about the rain.

00:49.432 --> 00:51.882
Tom, residents all over Quahog

00:51.945 --> 00:54.417
have been affected
by the heavy rains,

00:54.466 --> 00:57.270
although some are doing
their best to ride it out.

00:57.374 --> 00:59.198
For example, I'm here with

00:59.339 --> 01:01.988
Rides-a-Ten-Speed-
Everywhere Guy.

01:02.100 --> 01:05.473
Sir, why are you riding
your ten-speed in the rain?

01:05.659 --> 01:07.782
I don't mind-- a little
drizzle never hurt anybody.

01:07.887 --> 01:09.982
I like riding the ten-speed
because it's fun,

01:10.037 --> 01:12.390
it gives me energy, and
it's a great way to stay in shape.

01:12.478 --> 01:14.183
What do you do
for a living?

01:14.237 --> 01:16.920
I work in accounts receivable
at Quahog Insurance.

01:17.015 --> 01:19.220
Uh, it's not too demanding,
the pay is good,

01:19.337 --> 01:20.852
and it's a great way
to stay in shape.

01:20.925 --> 01:23.741
Well, we should wrap this up--
you're getting wet.

01:23.946 --> 01:25.953
I'm living life before
the cancer I have

01:25.998 --> 01:27.811
kills me
so I don't mind the rain.

01:27.895 --> 01:30.040
Water feels good on my skin.
It's cool, refreshing,

01:30.066 --> 01:31.720
and it's a great way
to stay in shape.

01:31.778 --> 01:34.273
- What kind of cancer?
- It's rectal cancer.

01:34.296 --> 01:36.320
It's slowly eating away
at my lower insides.

01:36.447 --> 01:38.920
It's a quick process, both
painful and untreatable,

01:38.967 --> 01:40.621
and it's a great way
to stay in shape.

01:40.707 --> 01:42.633
Thank you, Tricia.
Some local residents

01:42.667 --> 01:44.600
have even been evacuated
to Quahog Stadium

01:44.617 --> 01:45.953
for their own protection.

01:47.538 --> 01:50.623
- Why do I have to stay here?
- We just think you'll be safer.

01:50.758 --> 01:53.050
- But my house is dry.
- Here's a blanket.

01:53.125 --> 01:55.870
If you're looking for a bathroom,
it's all around you.

01:57.868 --> 01:59.803
Oh, crap, Peter,
it's a flash flood!

02:00.025 --> 02:02.911
Oh, man, I better save
my autographed picture of Dean Cain!

02:03.058 --> 02:05.570
You know, from before he got
all desperate for attention.

02:07.758 --> 02:09.680
Hey, is that Dean Cain
on that park bench?

02:09.715 --> 02:11.043
Oh, God!

02:11.785 --> 02:15.070
Lois! Uh, you may want
to come down here!

02:17.226 --> 02:19.621
- Oh, my God!
- I know--about the water, right?

02:19.787 --> 02:21.332
Wow! Cool!

02:22.378 --> 02:24.150
- Hey, Chris, come here.
- What? Why?

02:24.255 --> 02:25.220
Just come here.

02:25.395 --> 02:26.440
What is it, Dad?

02:26.475 --> 02:29.630
Does it feel like the water
suddenly just got warmer?

02:30.365 --> 02:32.653
That's right, it's pee
that makes it warmer.

02:32.898 --> 02:35.780
Peter, the water's rising fast!
We got to get out of here!

02:35.866 --> 02:37.550
Hang on, Lois. There's a case
of beer in the fridge.

02:37.626 --> 02:38.801
I can't leave that behind!

02:38.976 --> 02:40.423
Meg, you're a goodswimmer--
go get it.

02:40.476 --> 02:41.623
What?! But, Dad...

02:41.728 --> 02:43.630
And for God's sake,do not be afraid

02:43.677 --> 02:45.441
to make me a sandwich
while you're in there.

02:56.758 --> 02:58.862
Peter, Meg's been in
there a long time.

02:58.976 --> 03:02.100
Boy, you cannot wait to criticize her
at every turn, can you?

03:02.165 --> 03:03.561
Go get her!

03:07.776 --> 03:10.280
Well, Lois, I am sorry
for snapping at you earlier;

03:10.357 --> 03:11.670
You were right to critizise Meg.

03:11.746 --> 03:13.551
She could not even handle
this simple task.

03:13.646 --> 03:16.003
She's in there right now
taking a nap underwater.

03:16.095 --> 03:17.820
For God's sake, save her!

03:21.976 --> 03:24.732
My God, we better get her to a hospital.
She doesn't look too good.

03:24.976 --> 03:28.461
Yes, she looks worse than Andy Garcia
when he had his conjoined twin.

03:28.898 --> 03:32.402
I had a great time with you tonight.
You're really amazing.

03:32.555 --> 03:34.932
Thanks, Andy.
I had a great time, too.

03:35.355 --> 03:37.552
How about some love for
shoulder guy over here?

03:38.108 --> 03:39.963
Shoulder guy wants
to get in on this.

03:40.106 --> 03:42.301
- Just ignore him.
- Okay...

03:42.597 --> 03:44.971
So, do you maybe want
to go in the other room?

03:45.088 --> 03:46.543
Sure. Sounds good.

03:46.926 --> 03:49.072
And shoulder guy's going with ya.

03:49.125 --> 03:51.632
- Rick, shut up.
- Hey, bitch, want to suck on my tooth?

03:55.138 --> 03:58.081
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,
I'm afraid your coma's in a daughter.

03:58.507 --> 04:00.820
I mean... I mean,
your daughter's in a coma!

04:00.975 --> 04:02.580
What... Oh, my God,did you...

04:02.675 --> 04:04.161
did you hear what I said?

04:04.797 --> 04:06.330
Brain freeze!

04:06.725 --> 04:08.031
Oh, my God!

04:08.256 --> 04:10.540
That one's going
in the Christmas letter.

04:11.175 --> 04:12.892
Oh, my God, Peter,

04:13.055 --> 04:15.823
- what if she doesn't come out of it?
- I know, Lois.

04:16.024 --> 04:19.152
I never realized until now
how much I've taken her for granted.

04:19.456 --> 04:21.473
I mean, she's my only daughter,
and I

04:21.557 --> 04:24.062
feel like I've never treated her
as well as I should've.

04:24.377 --> 04:26.073
Hey, Meg, you got
something on you shirt.

04:30.298 --> 04:31.452
Hi, Dad.

04:32.317 --> 04:34.782
Aw, don't be too hard
on yourself, Peter.

04:34.885 --> 04:36.650
We all do things that
we're not proud of.

04:36.758 --> 04:38.210
Well, I am gonna change.

04:38.408 --> 04:40.430
You hear me, Meg?
If you come out of this,

04:40.508 --> 04:43.621
I am gonna treat you like a princess
for the rest of your life.

04:43.858 --> 04:46.190
'Cause I been a worse father
than Abraham.

04:47.086 --> 04:49.812
You want to tell me
what the ... that was?

04:56.315 --> 04:59.582
Excuse me, I'm Dr. Milano.
I'm the intern for this floor.

04:59.856 --> 05:01.863
You know, you guys
can probably go on home.

05:01.926 --> 05:04.413
We let you know if there's any change
in your daughter'scondition.

05:04.607 --> 05:06.070
Wow, you'rea real doctor?

05:06.216 --> 05:08.481
Hey, does Scrubs work here?
I love that guy.

05:08.686 --> 05:11.432
I want to meet Scrubs,
and I want to meet black Scrubs, too.

05:19.547 --> 05:23.182
Well, hello, sleepyhead.
I'm Michael.

05:23.667 --> 05:25.681
Hi, Michael.I'm Meg.

05:25.865 --> 05:28.171
- Meg!
- Oh, my God! Meg, you're OK !

05:28.486 --> 05:30.501
Oh, Meg, my beautiful daughter!

05:30.626 --> 05:32.170
Oh, thing sare gonna be different.

05:32.275 --> 05:34.702
No more will I treat you
like some kind of alien.

05:35.288 --> 05:38.082
<i>Three minutes
to minimum safe distance.</i>

05:38.786 --> 05:41.642
Stop. Not so fast, y'all.

05:41.826 --> 05:44.591
You think you can just up
and run away, you crazy.

05:44.875 --> 05:47.382
I like to eat people
from other planets,

05:47.627 --> 05:48.891
especially y'all.

05:48.968 --> 05:51.300
I likes to eat you
with my little mouth, too.

05:51.355 --> 05:53.850
Oh, now, y'all get back up
inside me, little mouth.

05:53.945 --> 05:55.691
I wants to play, too.

05:55.737 --> 05:58.733
Get back inside--
I'll get you when we's eatin' em.

06:02.176 --> 06:04.863
- So, what is ityou wanted to show me?
- That, Brian.

06:06.608 --> 06:08.100
What? It's a rundown old house.

06:08.206 --> 06:10.821
Well, yes, I-I suppose
to the untrained eye

06:10.856 --> 06:13.621
that's what it would look like.
Walk inside with me, Brian.

06:16.205 --> 06:18.912
This is disgusting--it smells, it's falling apart,

06:19.017 --> 06:21.512
and you can hear the mice
humping in the wall.

06:25.808 --> 06:27.671
That was so awesome!

06:27.966 --> 06:29.993
That's why we can get it
for a steal, Brian.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.250
We fix it up and sell it
for a huge profit!

06:32.377 --> 06:34.882
You're crazy. No, I'm not gonna buy
this house with you.

06:34.956 --> 06:37.410
Fine, I'll just give the profits
to another investor.

06:37.526 --> 06:39.942
- Plenty of others interested.
- Oh yeah, like who?

06:40.006 --> 06:41.403
Mort Goldman, for one.

06:41.456 --> 06:43.392
Says it's a smart investment.
But what does he know?

06:43.457 --> 06:44.610
He's only Jewish.

06:44.696 --> 06:45.823
All right, I'm in.

06:49.508 --> 06:51.983
Oh, there's my little angel!

06:52.087 --> 06:53.671
Here, let me get
that for you, sweetie.

06:53.738 --> 06:54.791
Thanks, Dad!

06:55.747 --> 06:57.263
Wow, Peter, I got to say,

06:57.367 --> 06:59.950
you've really been true
to your word about treating Meg better.

07:00.036 --> 07:01.482
She's my only daughter, Lois.

07:01.558 --> 07:04.113
She needs to be protected,
like a rare gemstone,

07:04.195 --> 07:06.791
or the herniated scrotum
of an older gentleman.

07:07.086 --> 07:08.751
Well, I think you've been wonderful.

07:08.858 --> 07:10.652
Like when you took her to
that new movie,

07:10.708 --> 07:13.340
I'm Rich and You're Poor,
but Let's Dance Together.

07:13.734 --> 07:16.858
I'm rich and you're poor,
but let's dance together.

07:16.959 --> 07:19.388
- Society won't like it.
- I don't care.

07:19.810 --> 07:21.943
Good for you, good for you.

07:22.199 --> 07:23.531
Yeah, and I can't believe

07:23.575 --> 07:25.552
how you stood up
to Connie D'Amico for me.

07:26.037 --> 07:28.413
- Hey, Meg.
- Uh, hi, Connie.

07:28.498 --> 07:30.460
I can't fit all my booksin my locker.

07:30.605 --> 07:33.270
Can I put the rest of them
on your giant enormous ass?

07:34.466 --> 07:36.863
Hey, Connie, hi.
Peter Griffin,Meg's father.

07:36.946 --> 07:38.602
Say, uh, can you do me a favor?

07:38.635 --> 07:40.343
You see that
fire extinguisher there?

07:42.008 --> 07:43.740
Dad, that'senough!

07:44.356 --> 07:45.920
Dad, that's enough!

07:46.865 --> 07:48.500
That'senough, Dad!

07:54.467 --> 07:57.552
I just want youto know, Meg,
if there's anythingyou ever want,

07:57.667 --> 07:59.680
- all you got to do is ask.
- Really?

07:59.756 --> 08:01.722
Well, there kind ofis one thing.

08:02.378 --> 08:04.063
There he is now!

08:05.916 --> 08:07.412
Hey, Meg.You ready to go?

08:07.516 --> 08:10.653
Dad, you remember MichaelMilano,
from the hospital.

08:10.748 --> 08:12.042
He's my date.

08:13.135 --> 08:14.823
Say, Michael, can you do me a favor?

08:14.927 --> 08:16.552
You see that
fire extinguisher there?

08:19.715 --> 08:22.142
Stay away from my daughter,
you possible rapist.

08:22.275 --> 08:24.401
Dad, stop it.
Michael's my date.

08:24.496 --> 08:27.391
Meg, I almost lost you once,
I'm not gonnalose you again.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.341
This guy may look harmless
on the outside,

08:29.446 --> 08:31.501
but on the inside he could
be a complete bastard,

08:31.568 --> 08:32.732
like Fred Flintstone.

08:33.184 --> 08:35.830
So, why exactly do
you want this separation?

08:35.905 --> 08:39.453
Well, Mr. Stoneberg, in a nutshell,
the cat put me outside,

08:39.636 --> 08:43.131
I was bangin' on the door for like
20 minutes, shouting "Wilma!"

08:43.227 --> 08:44.800
I didn't hear you.

08:44.917 --> 08:46.543
Oh, there's no way
you didn't hear me.

08:46.648 --> 08:48.510
I was in the shower.

08:48.597 --> 08:49.840
Oh, she was in the shower.

08:49.967 --> 08:53.381
The elephant's trunkwas on full blast.
I couldn't hear you.

08:53.448 --> 08:56.300
- And besides, you're always
- All you do is spend my money

08:56.378 --> 08:58.871
- on expensive clothesand hairdos.
- when to pay attention?

08:58.927 --> 09:01.980
But when I want to get my rocksoff,
you're nowhere to be found

09:02.068 --> 09:04.001
you passive-aggressive bitch.

09:04.447 --> 09:06.401
Meg, can I talk to you
in the kitchen, please?

09:06.906 --> 09:08.203
Dad, what the hell?

09:08.265 --> 09:10.051
Lois, did you know
that Meg had a date?

09:10.176 --> 09:12.380
Yes. With that nice boy
from the hospital.

09:12.455 --> 09:14.270
- What's the matter?
- We don't know him.

09:14.397 --> 09:15.793
Maybe he's not even a boy.

09:15.877 --> 09:17.512
Maybe he's two dwarves in an overcoat

09:17.605 --> 09:19.910
wanting to see what sex
is like with a big person.

09:20.728 --> 09:21.871
Is that what you want?

09:21.955 --> 09:24.042
Two crafty dwarves in your house,
after your daughter--

09:24.116 --> 09:25.250
wait, do dwarves grant wishes?

09:25.465 --> 09:27.492
No, Peter, they're people,
like you and me.

09:27.725 --> 09:29.181
Well, good-bye phonein the bathroom,

09:29.248 --> 09:31.110
but I still don't like Meg
dating that boy.

09:31.347 --> 09:33.390
Guy-guy-guy's that age,
all they care about is

09:33.467 --> 09:35.233
putting their thing in everything.

09:35.307 --> 09:38.520
I'm not gonna let Meg turn out like
my Nerf football in the hall closet.

09:38.728 --> 09:41.143
Dad, didn't you say you'd give me
whatever I wanted?

09:41.205 --> 09:42.820
Well, I want to go out with Michael.

09:43.055 --> 09:45.053
Peter, you're being overprotective.

09:45.146 --> 09:48.863
Look, why don't youjust talk to him?
You might find outhe's not so bad.

09:49.036 --> 09:51.560
All right, Lois, but
I know what my gut tells me.

09:51.686 --> 09:53.621
And right now
it's telling me I have...

09:53.698 --> 09:56.091
Indigestion.

09:56.795 --> 09:59.920
But I'll suck it up and talk Michael.
en though I've also go...

10:00.098 --> 10:02.883
Diarrhea.

10:05.728 --> 10:08.392
So, you are here
to take out my daughter.

10:08.446 --> 10:09.741
What are your intentions?

10:09.798 --> 10:13.080
I just think Meg is really cool,
and I want to get to know her better.

10:13.247 --> 10:14.930
You know, Michael,my daughter's womb

10:15.015 --> 10:18.730
is not a wild firefor you to douse
with your adolescent seed.

10:18.928 --> 10:21.571
- I understand.
- Do you, Michael? Do you?

10:22.365 --> 10:24.792
We'll see.
Let me ask you a question.

10:24.937 --> 10:27.061
You ever sit on your arm
till it falls asleep,

10:27.117 --> 10:29.741
and then play with yourself and
pretend like somebody else is doing it?

10:29.798 --> 10:31.582
Honestly... yes.

10:31.796 --> 10:33.292
Not anymore you don't.

10:33.396 --> 10:35.550
'Cause you're going out
with my daughter.

10:41.657 --> 10:43.590
Morning, Brian.
Here, put this on.

10:43.698 --> 10:45.460
- How long have you been here?
- 7:00 a.m.

10:45.516 --> 10:47.213
All right, here's your hammer, here's your walkie,

10:47.235 --> 10:48.560
and here's your stud finder.

10:49.658 --> 10:51.233
Oh. Oh, well, it's working.

10:52.067 --> 10:55.463
All right, joke time is over.
Work time has begun.

10:55.876 --> 10:57.371
You get started with this dry wall

10:57.458 --> 10:59.891
and I'm gonna start pulling out
those old floorboards in the kitchen.

11:00.036 --> 11:01.672
Hey, Brian, knock, knock.

11:01.987 --> 11:03.130
Who's there?

11:03.248 --> 11:05.621
Two friends building
a house together.

11:10.786 --> 11:14.681
Hey, Meg, I, uh, got you something
for our three-week anniversary.

11:15.475 --> 11:17.540
Wow, a Maroon 5 CD.

11:17.727 --> 11:20.703
Yeah, I remember how you told me
you liked terrible music,

11:20.768 --> 11:24.163
- so I thought you might appreciate it.
- You're so thoughtful.

11:25.647 --> 11:27.941
- Wh-what the hell?
- What's wrong?

11:28.786 --> 11:30.791
Uh, Meg, I'm not sure,
but I think

11:30.928 --> 11:33.091
dad is sitting at
that table over there.

11:33.218 --> 11:34.320
What? Where?

11:34.376 --> 11:36.293
Well, I-I can't tell if it's him.

11:36.436 --> 11:38.371
I think he's wearing
some kind of disguise.

11:39.186 --> 11:40.462
Oh, my God, Dad.

11:41.096 --> 11:44.212
- What do you think you're doing?
- Peter? Who Peter?

11:44.356 --> 11:46.981
I didn't say "Peter." I said "Dad."

11:49.157 --> 11:51.993
Have you been spying on us
the entire time we've been dating?

11:52.065 --> 11:54.000
Meg, it's only because I want
to make sure this guy

11:54.095 --> 11:56.161
treats you right and
doesn't try anything funny.

11:56.235 --> 11:58.410
Meg, this is more than
I can deal with.

11:58.517 --> 12:01.073
If your father is this opposed
to our relationship,

12:01.156 --> 12:02.991
I don't see
how it can work out.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.053
- But, Michael...
- I'm sorry, Meg.

12:05.136 --> 12:06.983
I promise I won't forget you.

12:08.385 --> 12:11.563
See, look, Meg, he just walked out
on you. He's a bad man.

12:11.667 --> 12:13.000
Like Jodie Foster.

12:15.605 --> 12:17.443
Oh, no, Jodie! It's my husband!

12:17.547 --> 12:18.933
He's home from work early!

12:19.078 --> 12:21.743
Don't worry, baby.
He had to findout sometime.

12:25.116 --> 12:27.112
All right, Brian, I'm going to go up
to the upper level

12:27.155 --> 12:28.711
and run this wire
down through the wall.

12:28.787 --> 12:31.243
Grab your walky
I'll call you when I get up there.

12:32.606 --> 12:34.570
<i>- Brian, pick up. Over.
- What?</i>

12:34.847 --> 12:37.422
<i>Brian, please say over
when you've finished talking. Over.</i>

12:37.645 --> 12:38.893
What? Over.

12:38.965 --> 12:41.441
<i>- Do you see the wire yet? Over.
- No.</i>

12:41.938 --> 12:43.761
<i>No... what? Over.</i>

12:43.827 --> 12:44.730
No. Over.

12:44.887 --> 12:46.782
<i>Okay, I'm going to start
feeding it through. Over.</i>

12:46.827 --> 12:49.840
Wait, if you haven't started feeding it,
why'd you ask me if I could see it?

12:50.148 --> 12:51.621
<i>Didn't copy that. Over.</i>

12:51.676 --> 12:53.332
I said why'd you ask
me if I could see it,

12:53.385 --> 12:55.290
if you haven't started
feeding it? Over.

12:55.346 --> 12:57.082
<i>Oh, that's better.
I can hear you now. Over.</i>

12:57.215 --> 12:58.372
<i>Do you see it yet? Over.</i>

12:58.436 --> 12:59.552
You know,you're a jackass.

12:59.617 --> 13:01.463
For the record, I don't want to
hang out with you anymore

13:01.498 --> 13:02.443
when this is over.

13:02.576 --> 13:03.910
<i>When this is what, Brian?
Over.</i>

13:03.956 --> 13:05.910
I said I don't want to hang out
with you anymore

13:05.955 --> 13:07.510
<i>- when this is over.
- When this is what?</i>

13:07.625 --> 13:09.131
<i>You've got to finish
your sentence. Over.</i>

13:09.216 --> 13:10.410
That's it. My sentence is over.

13:10.478 --> 13:11.802
<i>Your sentence is what, Brian?
Over.</i>

13:11.877 --> 13:12.671
My sentence is...

13:12.697 --> 13:14.163
Wait a minute. I have to say "over"

13:14.208 --> 13:15.802
even if the sentence ends
with the word "over"?

13:15.877 --> 13:17.500
<i>Ends with the word what, Brian?
Over.</i>

13:17.558 --> 13:19.980
<i>- Oh, I see the wire.
- You see the wire what? Over.</i>

13:20.068 --> 13:20.903
Over!

13:24.388 --> 13:27.350
<i>Tonight's movie presentation
is brought to you by Sanka.</i>

13:27.647 --> 13:29.783
<i>Don't you want a,want a Sanka?</i>

13:29.875 --> 13:33.602
Don't yawant a, want a Sanka?

13:33.808 --> 13:36.090
It doesn't keep me up at night,

13:36.217 --> 13:37.822
but it helps me poo!

13:41.925 --> 13:44.633
Meg, sweetie, it's been,like, two

13:44.727 --> 13:46.763
Don't you think it's time
to forget about that boy?

13:46.837 --> 13:49.432
Yeah, Meg, he was a bum anyway.
You'll find another fellow.

13:49.656 --> 13:51.950
I could set you up
with one of my friends.

13:52.105 --> 13:54.501
Oh wait... I don't have any friends.

13:54.735 --> 13:56.582
I could set you up with Dad.

13:56.808 --> 13:58.943
Dad, would you be
interested in dating Meg?

13:59.018 --> 14:00.110
I certainly would.

14:00.308 --> 14:01.730
There, Meg,everything's fine.

14:01.828 --> 14:05.542
- It's not Michael I'm upset about!
- Well, what is it then?

14:06.185 --> 14:07.562
I'm pregnant!

14:08.966 --> 14:10.270
Dad, I swear to God

14:10.406 --> 14:12.871
I didn't know that
when I set you up with her.

14:16.615 --> 14:20.053
Oh, I can't believe this!
My baby's pregnant!

14:20.117 --> 14:22.100
- How could this happen?
- I don't know.

14:22.147 --> 14:24.153
But regardless of how it happened,
it happened.

14:24.306 --> 14:27.143
You're pregnant, Meg,
and there's only one thing to do.

14:33.178 --> 14:35.852
Meg, can you turn over?
I gotta get that thing out of there.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.051
You're sitting on my shirt;
I gotta put it on this hanger.

14:39.866 --> 14:43.292
Now I'm going to Michael's house
to force himto marry you.

14:45.196 --> 14:46.660
Dad, please don't do this!

14:46.796 --> 14:49.581
- You can't make him marry me!
- I just want to talk to him.

14:49.727 --> 14:50.950
Why do you have a shotgun?

14:50.978 --> 14:52.253
I just wantto talk to him.

14:52.346 --> 14:54.833
- Dad, this is ridiculous!
- I just want to talk to him.

14:54.976 --> 14:57.781
- I just want totalk to him.
- It is not his fault!

14:57.846 --> 15:00.382
- I just want to shoot him.
- You can't shoot him!

15:00.467 --> 15:02.641
Wait, what... what are you doing?

15:02.866 --> 15:04.850
You got my Meg pregnant!

15:04.968 --> 15:07.011
What?!
Oh, my God!

15:07.197 --> 15:09.183
Meg! Why didn't you tell me?

15:09.316 --> 15:11.061
I didn't think you wanted
to see me.

15:11.137 --> 15:14.160
But this changes everything.
I want to be there for you, Meg.

15:14.837 --> 15:16.121
I love you.

15:17.037 --> 15:18.511
Will you marry me?

15:18.858 --> 15:21.040
Yes!
Of course!

15:21.347 --> 15:24.043
Ah, now see?
That's an even more beautiful sight

15:24.096 --> 15:26.383
than 72 virgins waiting in heaven

15:26.456 --> 15:27.743
for a suicide bomber.

15:28.448 --> 15:29.721
Here I am!

15:29.956 --> 15:32.580
We're playing Magic: The Gathering.
Want to join?

15:32.747 --> 15:34.210
Osama!

15:38.835 --> 15:40.962
- You know something, Brian?
- Yeah?

15:41.098 --> 15:42.592
I'm starting to think maybe

15:42.707 --> 15:45.150
we bit off a little more
than we could chew.

15:45.436 --> 15:46.070
Yeah.

15:46.316 --> 15:49.100
Well, we're in it and
we're going to finish the job.

15:49.328 --> 15:51.132
Should we get started
on the upper level?

15:53.666 --> 15:54.653
No.

15:54.956 --> 15:56.062
What the hell are we gonna do?

15:56.118 --> 15:58.380
We've sunk all of our money
into this place.

15:58.466 --> 16:01.922
I've, um... I've got an idea.
I'll be right back.

16:04.167 --> 16:07.282
So, listen, we're going to want
to be leaving now.

16:07.376 --> 16:07.991
Why ?

16:08.045 --> 16:10.913
Because I just emptied a full tank
of gasoline and lit a match.

16:10.976 --> 16:12.523
We've got about five seconds.

16:34.955 --> 16:37.311
Didn't we have an electrician
in there today?

16:37.516 --> 16:39.572
He left. Pretty sure he left.

16:39.577 --> 16:41.120
Isn't that his truck?

16:42.988 --> 16:44.733
Well, by God, Brian,
we're murderers.

16:44.816 --> 16:47.330
I guess this means you'll
be going to doggie hell.

16:56.215 --> 16:58.083
Hey, what do you guys
think of this one?

16:58.126 --> 17:00.632
Meg, are you sure you want
to go through with this?

17:00.708 --> 17:02.700
You know, there are other options.

17:02.806 --> 17:04.721
Mom, I'm not getting an abortion!

17:04.996 --> 17:07.362
I'm not saying an abortion,
per se,

17:07.536 --> 17:09.762
maybe you just drink
and smoke a lot.

17:09.946 --> 17:10.579
What ?!

17:10.708 --> 17:12.040
Just don't stop doing it

17:12.086 --> 17:14.123
and then chicken out
halfway through the pregnancy,

17:14.175 --> 17:15.983
because then
you'll wind up with Chris.

17:16.075 --> 17:17.420
Well, Lois, I got the cake.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.252
Oh, and they were all out
of the bride and groom figurines,

17:20.326 --> 17:22.943
so I got the Iron Giant
and a courtroom doll

17:23.025 --> 17:25.621
that kids use to show where
the molester touched them.

17:28.457 --> 17:30.570
All right, Meg, enjoy your
bachelorette party.

17:30.837 --> 17:32.122
I'm out of here

17:32.185 --> 17:34.061
'cause I don't need to see
what you crazy girls

17:34.107 --> 17:35.382
are going to do while I'm gone.

17:35.446 --> 17:36.761
But just remember, this is a residence

17:36.765 --> 17:38.083
and should be treated as such.

17:38.186 --> 17:39.611
And if you girls drink anything,

17:39.676 --> 17:41.690
there's recycling under
the sink in the kitchen.

17:41.855 --> 17:42.852
Okay, have fun.

17:44.448 --> 17:46.890
So... what are we supposed to do?

17:46.997 --> 17:49.203
Yeah, this doesn't seem like
much of a party.

17:51.618 --> 17:53.360
Hey, what's with all the noise?

17:53.467 --> 17:55.573
Got some complaints
from next door.

17:55.687 --> 17:59.602
I might have to take you girls...
downtown.

18:06.735 --> 18:08.822
Which one of you is the lucky bride?

18:10.736 --> 18:13.890
- What's your name, sweetie?
- Dad, you know my name.

18:14.266 --> 18:15.770
It's Officer Nasty.

18:15.958 --> 18:19.883
Careful, I might be carrying
a concealed weapon.

18:30.886 --> 18:33.052
- Hello.
- Hi. Name, please?

18:33.116 --> 18:35.490
- Neil Goldman.
- Goldman, Goldman...

18:35.568 --> 18:38.152
- Sorry, no Neil Goldman.
- Oh, I beg your pardon.

18:38.207 --> 18:39.993
I meant to say Chris Griffin.

18:40.116 --> 18:42.280
Griffin, Griffin... Oh! here it is.

18:42.457 --> 18:43.672
Says you're supposed to be an usher.

18:43.676 --> 18:44.902
Well, you need this.

18:45.026 --> 18:47.101
- Name, please?
- Chris Griffin.

18:47.198 --> 18:48.850
Griffin, Griffin, hmm.

18:48.975 --> 18:51.322
I'm sorry, sir, Chris Griffin
has already checked in.

18:51.407 --> 18:53.150
Well, that's impossible!

18:55.018 --> 18:56.692
Meg, are you ready?

18:56.817 --> 18:58.671
Sweetie, what's wrong?

18:58.765 --> 19:01.830
Mom, I can't do it.
I can't get married.

19:02.178 --> 19:04.120
What?! Well, why not?

19:04.258 --> 19:06.690
Because...
I'm not pregnant.

19:06.918 --> 19:08.961
What do you mean?
How do you know?

19:10.526 --> 19:11.990
I got my period.

19:12.906 --> 19:14.620
I must've read the test wrong.

19:14.716 --> 19:17.633
What am I going to do?
Michael's out there waiting for me.

19:17.927 --> 19:20.380
Well, Meg, the best thing
you can do is be honest.

19:20.526 --> 19:22.072
Just tell Michael the truth.

19:22.176 --> 19:24.542
If he cares about you,
he'll understand.

19:24.676 --> 19:26.852
I'll try.
Thanks, Mom.

19:27.127 --> 19:30.151
- I love you.
- I... you too, honey.

19:41.507 --> 19:44.811
God, look at Meg's fat shoulders
in those spaghetti straps!

19:44.927 --> 19:47.133
It's like bread baking
around twine.

19:49.787 --> 19:53.272
- Meg... you look beautiful.
- Thank you , Michael.

19:53.408 --> 19:54.932
I have never been more in love

19:54.985 --> 19:57.172
with someone than I am
with you right now.

19:57.275 --> 19:59.141
Oh, Michael, I love you, too.

19:59.246 --> 20:01.450
And I have some wonderful news:

20:01.636 --> 20:03.910
- I'm not pregnant.
- What?!

20:08.905 --> 20:11.211
Dad, I'm sorry about
this whole mess.

20:11.766 --> 20:14.392
You know what, Meg?
It's all my fault.

20:14.645 --> 20:17.271
I never should've dragged
you into this, anyway.

20:17.628 --> 20:19.342
I guess sometimes a father

20:19.445 --> 20:22.370
just gets a little over
protective of his daughter, but

20:22.467 --> 20:24.943
you got to know I was only thinking
about your happiness.

20:25.056 --> 20:27.341
I know, Dad.
And I appreciate it.

20:27.436 --> 20:30.272
The problem now is that
these people are expecting a show.

20:30.825 --> 20:33.090
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Conway Twitty.

20:34.485 --> 20:36.101
Hello, again.

20:37.195 --> 20:39.073
Nice to see you

20:39.508 --> 20:45.452
<i>It's been a long time
You're just as lovely</i>

20:46.218 --> 20:50.372
<i>As you used to be</i>

20:52.887 --> 20:56.790
<i>How's your new life?
Are you happy?</i>

20:57.407 --> 21:01.143
<i>Hope you're doin' fine</i>

21:01.327 --> 21:03.332
<i>Just to know it</i>

21:03.976 --> 21:08.092
