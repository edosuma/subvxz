02:07.689 --> 02:10.324
That's a new world
record for Misha Averin.

02:10.326 --> 02:13.929
Mom! Mom!
I've done fifty-seven seconds!

02:13.931 --> 02:15.197
Nice.

02:36.251 --> 02:38.321
- Bedtime.
- No bed.

02:38.756 --> 02:40.289
It's late. Misha!

02:42.559 --> 02:43.560
Misha!

02:47.397 --> 02:48.832
Misha, it's not funny.

02:49.332 --> 02:50.699
- Come here!
- No bed!

02:50.701 --> 02:51.735
Misha.

02:52.536 --> 02:53.836
Mikhail, grab him!

02:54.571 --> 02:58.506
No bed!
No bed, no bed, no bed.

02:58.508 --> 02:59.610
No!

03:01.779 --> 03:02.846
Misha.

03:03.882 --> 03:05.849
Come here,
couch! Couch!

03:07.617 --> 03:09.687
Couch, couch, couch.
Okay.

03:10.788 --> 03:11.789
No!

03:13.691 --> 03:16.226
Okay.
I'm done with it.

03:17.461 --> 03:19.196
Oh, give...
Give Mommy a kiss,

03:19.430 --> 03:20.564
she's tired.

03:28.740 --> 03:29.805
Go to bed!

03:29.807 --> 03:31.007
- No.
- Misha!

03:31.009 --> 03:32.444
Come...

03:32.776 --> 03:34.609
- He hasn't called you?
- No.

03:36.280 --> 03:38.513
- What a bastard.
- Yeah, well,

03:38.515 --> 03:40.849
I don't know, I mean, it's...
It's been a day, but, still...

03:40.851 --> 03:43.286
- Yeah, but... I mean...
- He should call, right?

03:43.288 --> 03:45.857
He should've called, right? No?
He should have called?

03:47.291 --> 03:48.591
You got in late?

03:48.593 --> 03:49.960
- Hello.
- Sir.

03:49.962 --> 03:52.229
About 4 a.m.
what was a great party...

03:54.833 --> 03:57.001
- Morning.
- Good morning, sir!

04:05.910 --> 04:08.344
- This is all I've got.
- Thank you, Sergey,

04:08.346 --> 04:09.679
he will appreciate it.

04:12.417 --> 04:13.853
- Slowly...
- <i>Roger!</i>

04:15.420 --> 04:16.454
That's it!

04:17.523 --> 04:19.689
Sorry, gentlemen,
we have received nothing

04:19.690 --> 04:20.723
from Moscow.

04:23.062 --> 04:24.830
So what are we supposed
to live on?

04:25.330 --> 04:27.799
If I knew that,
I would be living on it too.

04:28.934 --> 04:30.600
At least you have
a deployment coming,

04:30.602 --> 04:31.769
you'll get a sea bonus.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.036
Which will not be paid.

04:41.746 --> 04:42.715
Pavel!

04:43.648 --> 04:44.950
We have to go, come up!

04:46.052 --> 04:47.753
Sergey gave us eight hundred!

04:48.654 --> 04:50.656
- She added more!
- She what?

04:50.923 --> 04:52.491
She added more!

04:56.062 --> 04:58.831
She said everything
on the list or she'd kill me.

04:59.465 --> 05:04.135
Um, another four cases of vodka,
five more cases of beer,

05:04.137 --> 05:07.373
eighteen rolls of crepe,
balloons, champagne...

05:07.606 --> 05:08.607
Shit!

05:09.843 --> 05:11.044
Then cancel it!

05:13.613 --> 05:15.613
Or marry me instead!

05:15.615 --> 05:16.814
Who's got our money?

05:16.816 --> 05:18.649
- What?
- Who's got our money?

05:18.651 --> 05:19.652
Anton.

05:25.391 --> 05:27.326
It's not enough,
it's not even close.

05:27.727 --> 05:28.862
We'll be fine.

05:29.462 --> 05:30.463
Oleg!

05:32.666 --> 05:34.833
- I would marry me.
- Shut up!

05:34.835 --> 05:36.003
No, seriously.

05:38.538 --> 05:40.574
- I would be the perfect wife.
- Shut up, Oleg.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.008
Give me the list.

05:45.980 --> 05:47.982
- Hello.
- This is what we need.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.585
This is the money,
it's a bit short, but...

05:53.087 --> 05:54.088
Forget it.

05:55.223 --> 05:56.222
- I'll pay the balance next week.
- Yeah, sure you will.

05:56.224 --> 05:58.189
Or the week after,
at the latest, I promise.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.392
Cash and carry.

06:00.393 --> 06:01.162
Come on, it's... It's my
best friend's wedding.

06:02.163 --> 06:03.728
I think
we're done here.

06:03.730 --> 06:05.433
Look,
are you serious?

06:05.632 --> 06:07.001
Yeah, I'm dead serious.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.770
I don't believe this...

06:15.842 --> 06:17.609
- Hey, Mikhail, hey!
- What?

06:17.611 --> 06:19.013
No. No, no, no,
Mikhail.

06:19.914 --> 06:21.082
You see this?

06:22.515 --> 06:23.618
What about this?

06:25.987 --> 06:27.588
Submariners' watch.

06:28.890 --> 06:30.555
Anything else you need?

06:30.557 --> 06:33.996
Shoes, jackets, underwear?

06:36.130 --> 06:37.965
Okay, wow.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.067
That's great.

06:41.136 --> 06:43.471
- Really nice!
- Looks good, huh?

06:43.838 --> 06:45.204
That will make her happy.

06:45.206 --> 06:46.407
Okay!

07:42.899 --> 07:44.230
This will help you
a little bit.

07:44.232 --> 07:45.935
Can we have
some vodka, please?

07:46.535 --> 07:48.034
This is... This is...
This is my watch

07:48.036 --> 07:49.471
that we're drinking on.

07:50.606 --> 07:52.475
Should we start the dinner now
or wait a little bit?

07:53.943 --> 07:55.009
What happened to your watch?

07:55.011 --> 07:57.144
No, no, no, don't worry!
It's... It's a long story.

07:57.146 --> 07:58.746
- We're all a bit naked.
- Yes.

07:58.748 --> 08:01.015
- What did you do?
- What happened to them?

08:01.017 --> 08:02.249
- We sold the watches.
- Anton!

08:02.251 --> 08:04.752
- You didn't.
- You sold them, why?

08:04.754 --> 08:07.222
Well because of...
Because of this!

08:07.224 --> 08:10.024
And this! And this! And this!

08:10.026 --> 08:11.759
And everything! Yes!

08:11.761 --> 08:12.996
- Seriously?
- We bought it.

08:15.765 --> 08:17.332
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, yeah.

08:17.334 --> 08:19.769
Oleg, what's happening?
Are you crying?

08:20.904 --> 08:23.204
Look at him, he's crying!

08:23.206 --> 08:24.605
- He's crying.
- I'm not crying.

08:24.607 --> 08:27.177
What is the matter with you?
Stop crying!

08:28.312 --> 08:30.879
- Let's get something to eat.
- Yeah, let's eat. Oleg!

08:30.881 --> 08:32.749
Stop crying,
you'll make me cry.

08:33.250 --> 08:37.520
Yeah, he's crying.
I'm sorry, I'm really drunk.

08:37.953 --> 08:39.123
Oleg, stop it.

08:40.289 --> 08:41.756
Are you enjoying yourself?

08:41.758 --> 08:43.225
Just for my wife, one more.

08:43.227 --> 08:44.826
I have no idea maybe

08:44.828 --> 08:46.628
it's the very barrenness
of this place

08:46.630 --> 08:48.230
that brings us together,

08:48.232 --> 08:50.968
but there is no denying
that we are one.

08:52.036 --> 08:55.538
And tonight,
Pavel and Daria are one.

08:57.841 --> 08:59.608
And as Pavel's best friend...

08:59.610 --> 09:01.344
Oh, look
who's crying now.

09:01.346 --> 09:02.612
Shut up.

09:04.048 --> 09:06.848
Me? Me? What did I say? Huh?

09:06.850 --> 09:10.789
As Pavel's best friend
let me propose a toast

09:11.356 --> 09:14.890
to Pavel and Daria
and the half-dozen children

09:14.892 --> 09:17.160
they will have,
that will take care of me,

09:17.162 --> 09:19.128
their Uncle Anton,
in my old age.

09:19.130 --> 09:21.733
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

09:27.671 --> 09:31.242
And I would love to offer
a toast to Daria.

09:32.277 --> 09:35.713
As my lovely Tanya can attest,

09:36.314 --> 09:40.185
life, as a Navy wife,
is not easy.

09:41.052 --> 09:44.956
Life here at the Northern Fleet,
is even harder.

09:45.657 --> 09:49.293
And then imagine
being Pavel's wife...

09:49.295 --> 09:51.863
...on top of that.

09:52.430 --> 09:54.200
Imagine the agony!

09:57.702 --> 09:59.170
But we make do...

10:00.738 --> 10:02.874
and when things
get at their worst...

10:03.975 --> 10:05.177
what do we do?

10:06.479 --> 10:09.912

Good for you!
Ten years! Ten years of luck!

11:47.847 --> 11:50.351

What are you doing?

12:20.847 --> 12:21.848
Shh.

12:22.551 --> 12:24.185
You wanna go next door.

12:31.460 --> 12:32.427
Stop.

12:34.996 --> 12:37.498
- Can you feel him?
- Mm-hmm, I do.

12:41.335 --> 12:42.904
Sleep well, my love.

12:44.206 --> 12:46.341
Sleep well, my forever.

13:13.969 --> 13:15.102

- Hey!

13:15.104 --> 13:16.303
Morning, sir!

13:18.307 --> 13:20.341
- Good morning!
- Good morning, sir!

13:20.343 --> 13:21.908
Hey, ready to go fishing?

13:21.910 --> 13:23.009
How are you?

13:38.428 --> 13:40.361
Sir, what're you gonna
play on that TV?

13:40.363 --> 13:42.363
We're gonna play
some very serious shit.

13:46.035 --> 13:48.271
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Slowly!

13:49.238 --> 13:51.138
- I got it!
- We did it!

13:52.208 --> 13:53.374
Have they started it?

13:53.376 --> 13:54.377
I don't know?

13:57.246 --> 13:59.180
Aleksij, what's going on?

13:59.182 --> 14:01.182
You have to get back
into shape, my friend!

14:01.184 --> 14:02.318
Ah, shut up!

14:19.035 --> 14:20.571
- Aleksij, how are you?
- Good, thanks.

14:21.104 --> 14:23.640
We were right there,
in Moscow.

14:25.142 --> 14:26.408
No, no, no! Look!

14:26.410 --> 14:28.310
No, leave the music,

14:54.037 --> 14:56.171
Still married?
After twenty-four hours?

14:56.173 --> 14:58.039
So far, so good.

14:58.041 --> 14:59.677
Oh, you're lucky
she's so tolerant.

15:00.278 --> 15:02.113
So, this is the Fat Girl?

15:02.379 --> 15:04.516
Yeah, it's sweating.

15:05.349 --> 15:06.551
Is it angry?

15:07.017 --> 15:09.586
One hundred thirty degrees.
Within parameters.

15:10.422 --> 15:12.290
Not angry but irritated.

15:13.525 --> 15:16.258
Reactor's

15:18.128 --> 15:20.398
Port and starboard
TG's on line.

15:21.299 --> 15:22.667
Main engines ready.

15:29.507 --> 15:31.707
<i>Start doing one
on northern time.</i>

15:31.709 --> 15:33.342
Propulsion crew, on line.

15:33.344 --> 15:35.044
Pre-sea and Harbor
Station checks?

15:35.046 --> 15:37.046
Complete and reported
to maneuvering.

15:37.048 --> 15:39.150
We'll need to keep an eye
on the aft hydraulic system.

15:39.417 --> 15:41.017
- Okay.
- Instrument check?

15:41.019 --> 15:42.688
Complete and correct.

16:08.079 --> 16:10.216
The <i>Kursk</i> is going!
Hurry!

16:11.283 --> 16:12.816
- Wait for me!
- Hey! Hurry up!

16:12.818 --> 16:14.283
It's right there!

17:22.188 --> 17:23.722
- Thank you.
- All the way, sir.

17:23.723 --> 17:24.825
He's coming...

17:25.693 --> 17:27.093
Be careful.

17:28.529 --> 17:30.196
Admiral on deck!

17:30.664 --> 17:31.665
Carry on.

17:32.366 --> 17:33.367
Coffee.

17:34.534 --> 17:36.334
<i>Officers of watch.
Knot. Needs to take it.</i>

17:36.336 --> 17:38.539
Exercise
position acquired. Mark

17:45.279 --> 17:46.645
Carry up the frigates

17:46.647 --> 17:49.483
and redeploy north sixteen
point five.

17:49.885 --> 17:51.151
Yes, sir.

17:52.152 --> 17:53.689
Must I do
everything myself?

17:54.155 --> 17:55.156
No, sir.

18:03.931 --> 18:05.833
A grand sight, isn't it?

18:07.702 --> 18:10.404
Twenty years ago,
for this exercise,

18:11.672 --> 18:14.375
we had three times
this number of ships.

18:15.209 --> 18:17.345
Now half of them
rust at dry dock.

18:20.615 --> 18:23.819
Two-thirds of our submarines
are being cut apart for scrap.

18:28.857 --> 18:30.559
You remember the <i>Kutuzov?</i>

18:31.626 --> 18:33.660
- My first command?
- Mm-hmm.

18:33.662 --> 18:35.797
It has off-loaded its missiles

18:36.297 --> 18:38.833
and is delivering meat
and vegetables to our base

18:38.835 --> 18:40.201
at Polyarny.

18:40.769 --> 18:42.936
Now, if the Americans attack,

18:42.938 --> 18:44.904
the <i>Kutuzov</i> can throw cabbage
at them.

18:46.842 --> 18:48.508
Still,
it's impressive.

18:48.510 --> 18:50.443
More than enough
to send a message

18:50.445 --> 18:51.779
to our enemies.

18:51.781 --> 18:53.413
Now
all we have to do

18:53.415 --> 18:55.784
is figure out
who our enemies are.

18:58.755 --> 18:59.922
Commodore Russell,

19:01.390 --> 19:03.492
Deputy Flag Officer,
Submarines.

19:03.859 --> 19:05.659
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

19:10.499 --> 19:12.265
What's the word
on the Russian exercise?

19:12.267 --> 19:13.701
Fifty-seven
surface ships,

19:13.703 --> 19:15.403
and three detected submarines.

19:15.405 --> 19:19.574
An Oscar II, the <i>Kursk,</i>
departed Vidyaevo, at 0720.

19:20.309 --> 19:21.341
Sonics?

19:21.343 --> 19:22.645
Silent and invisible.

19:23.013 --> 19:23.981
Oscar class.

19:25.515 --> 19:27.448
Thank Goodness the Russians
don't have the money

19:27.450 --> 19:28.918
to build more of those things.

19:29.786 --> 19:31.484
At least we could hear
the Typhoons

19:31.486 --> 19:32.922
so we didn't bump into them.

19:33.723 --> 19:35.790
Amazing to think
that the Russians used to do

19:35.792 --> 19:38.426
- one of these every year.
- Right.

19:38.428 --> 19:40.027
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.

19:40.029 --> 19:42.899
- Is Admiral Gruzinsky on site?
- At sea and in command.

19:43.900 --> 19:45.635
You know him, don't you, sir?

19:46.569 --> 19:50.639
Met him. We fished...
and drank.

19:52.442 --> 19:54.277
Yes, too much in my case.

19:55.511 --> 20:00.316
So, Admiral Gruzinsky,
what've you got up your sleeve?

20:30.982 --> 20:32.714
Officer of the Watch,

20:32.716 --> 20:34.349
take us to twenty-eight meters.

20:34.351 --> 20:36.084
Come right to zero-eight-five.

20:36.086 --> 20:38.453
When you have caught the trim
come up to twenty knots.

20:38.455 --> 20:40.355
Twenty-eight meters,
zero-eight-five

20:40.357 --> 20:41.525
and twenty knots, sir.

20:41.759 --> 20:42.859
Table of arms?

20:42.861 --> 20:44.593
Twenty-four
SS-16 missiles.

20:44.595 --> 20:45.862
Twenty-one L-55 torpedoes.

20:45.864 --> 20:47.766
And one HP practice torpedo.

20:48.332 --> 20:49.601
- The Fat Girl.
- Yes.

20:49.833 --> 20:51.536
- Status?
- Stable.

20:52.537 --> 20:54.906
HP's, I hate them,
cheap and dangerous.

20:57.008 --> 20:58.009
1-3-5.

21:02.680 --> 21:03.714
I've no watch.

21:07.451 --> 21:09.621
I'll be happy when it's time
to say goodbye to it.

21:16.694 --> 21:17.762
Attention!

21:20.032 --> 21:21.033
At ease.

21:25.036 --> 21:27.806
The exercise
will have three phases.

21:28.740 --> 21:31.911
Test missile fired,
test torpedo fired,

21:32.443 --> 21:34.612
return to base undetected.

21:35.013 --> 21:36.081
Reactor status?

21:37.082 --> 21:38.617
Both reactors on line, sir.

21:39.051 --> 21:40.318
Armaments?

21:41.954 --> 21:44.355
Our test torpedo
is currently stable,

21:44.622 --> 21:46.826
but has a slightly elevated
internal temperature,

21:47.458 --> 21:49.828
indicating a possible
hydrogen peroxide leak.

21:50.429 --> 21:51.361
Noted.

21:51.363 --> 21:53.529
We'll get rid of it
as soon as we reach

21:53.531 --> 21:55.000
her fire authorization window.

21:55.634 --> 21:57.736
- Anything else?
- No.

21:58.403 --> 21:59.471
Fall out.

22:42.115 --> 22:43.117
Tube clear.

22:43.750 --> 22:44.918
Prepare to load!

22:48.955 --> 22:52.092
Sir, temperature spike, 142,
rising.

22:54.996 --> 22:57.497
Command, priority comm.
I need to speak to the Captain.

23:02.602 --> 23:03.870
<i>This is the Captain.</i>

23:05.106 --> 23:08.139
Sir, our test torpedo is angry.
It's 142 degrees and rising.

23:08.141 --> 23:09.142
One four eight.

23:10.043 --> 23:11.044
One four eight.

23:12.213 --> 23:15.149
Request permission to fire
prior to authorized window.

23:16.516 --> 23:18.518
<i>Are we still
below abort threshold?</i>

23:19.519 --> 23:20.520
Yes, sir.

23:21.588 --> 23:22.755
<i>We're seven minutes</i>

23:22.757 --> 23:24.158
<i>from our fire
authorization window.</i>

23:24.891 --> 23:26.093
<i>And we're not in position.</i>

23:26.793 --> 23:27.995
<i>Permission denied.</i>

23:32.099 --> 23:33.100
Yes, sir.

23:35.236 --> 23:36.470
By the book.

23:47.749 --> 23:48.749
One five two.

23:55.690 --> 23:56.825
Say your prayers.

23:58.293 --> 23:59.693
I'm not a religious man.

24:36.865 --> 24:38.132
Secure the compartment!

24:38.134 --> 24:39.034
Secure the compartment.

24:39.935 --> 24:41.334
Secure all hatches!
All valves closed.

24:41.336 --> 24:43.037
Sir, what is it?
What is it?

24:43.039 --> 24:44.671
Secure
the forward bulkhead.

24:44.673 --> 24:47.176
Secure bulkhead doors,
all valves closed!

24:53.349 --> 24:55.750
Command, Command,
this is Compartment Seven,

24:55.752 --> 24:56.784
come in.

24:56.786 --> 24:58.185
Command,
this is Compartment Seven,

24:58.187 --> 24:59.220
come in!

24:59.222 --> 25:00.620
Why isn't Command responding?

25:00.622 --> 25:01.855
Because they're dead,
that's why.

25:01.857 --> 25:02.857
Quiet.

25:02.859 --> 25:04.759
- Why are we not surfacing?
- Why do you think?

25:04.761 --> 25:05.762
Quiet!

25:08.731 --> 25:10.631
<i>Command,
this is Compartment Seven,</i>

25:10.633 --> 25:11.468
<i>come in.</i>

25:13.069 --> 25:14.735
<i>Command,
this is Compartment Seven,</i>

25:14.737 --> 25:15.738
<i>come in.</i>

25:23.313 --> 25:25.282
Sir, there is a fire
in the torpedo room.

25:25.915 --> 25:27.151
Detonation temperature?

25:29.318 --> 25:31.185
I think the war heads
explode at one...

25:31.187 --> 25:32.686
One-eighty degrees.

25:32.688 --> 25:33.689
How much?

25:34.791 --> 25:35.992
One-eighty degrees.

25:47.337 --> 25:48.671
That's off the scale.

26:02.252 --> 26:03.651
What are we going to do?

26:03.653 --> 26:05.154
As we've trained.
Secure comp...

26:44.329 --> 26:47.198
Go aft while you can!
To Compartment Nine!

26:48.467 --> 26:50.135
Pavel and Anton are forward!

26:56.774 --> 26:58.243
Go to Compartment Nine!

26:59.445 --> 27:01.880
Leave him on the platform.
Go to Compartment Nine.

27:08.253 --> 27:09.254
Move on!

27:10.389 --> 27:13.392
Anton! Anton!

27:21.500 --> 27:23.267
Compartment Five,
this is Compartment Seven

27:23.269 --> 27:24.270
come in.

27:26.005 --> 27:27.006
Compartment Five,

27:28.007 --> 27:29.071
Compartment Five,
this is Compartment Seven,

27:29.073 --> 27:30.074
come in!

27:31.109 --> 27:32.476
- Mikhail, they're gone.
- Compartment Five,

27:32.478 --> 27:34.311
this is Compartment Seven,
come in.

27:34.313 --> 27:36.215
Let's just go. Let's go!

27:36.482 --> 27:38.017
<i>This is Five. Mikhail?</i>

27:38.285 --> 27:41.085
Anton, we're in Seven.
What's... What's your status?

27:42.454 --> 27:43.989
<i>The reactor's
melting down.</i>

27:44.957 --> 27:46.426
<i>Emergency cooling
is inoperative.</i>

27:47.026 --> 27:48.761
- Get out of there!
- <i>We can't leave</i>

27:49.028 --> 27:50.095
<i>or it's Chernobyl.</i>

27:51.096 --> 27:52.164
<i>We've got to activate
convection cooling.</i>

27:52.965 --> 27:54.200
What's the water level?

27:54.967 --> 27:56.436
<i>It's rising, fast!</i>

28:00.472 --> 28:01.473
<i>Mikhail?</i>

28:05.144 --> 28:06.346
<i>Tell Vera I love her.</i>

28:07.813 --> 28:08.814
<i>Goodbye.</i>

28:10.049 --> 28:11.050
Goodbye.

28:32.372 --> 28:33.804
Move, move, move!

28:33.806 --> 28:35.242
Go to Compartment Nine!

28:57.998 --> 28:59.200
Is anyone here?

29:05.205 --> 29:06.340
Go, go, go!

29:07.375 --> 29:09.776
Peter, Peter? Peter!

29:10.244 --> 29:11.412
Go right away.

29:12.113 --> 29:13.114
Right away!

29:13.381 --> 29:14.448
Move, move, move!

29:23.257 --> 29:26.358
Leo, come on!
Leo, let's go! Leo!

29:26.360 --> 29:27.828
Don't touch me!

29:30.364 --> 29:31.365
Wake up!

29:39.407 --> 29:41.275
Move! Move it!

30:19.114 --> 30:20.980
Sir, do we exactly know
what happened?

30:20.982 --> 30:22.084
Not sure.

30:22.318 --> 30:23.552
So why are we alive?

30:25.053 --> 30:26.955
We are aft,
that's why we're alive.

30:29.024 --> 30:30.491
The explosion was forward
and we are aft

30:30.493 --> 30:32.295
so the bulkheads protected us
from it.

30:33.128 --> 30:34.429
What are we going to do?

30:35.665 --> 30:38.333
Let's use the hatch
and get the hell out of here.

30:39.134 --> 30:40.570
We're taking on water.

30:41.069 --> 30:43.439
No, no, first things first.

30:45.274 --> 30:49.209
We stabilize the compartment,
we inventory our assets,

30:49.211 --> 30:50.245
and then...

30:50.480 --> 30:52.515
Then we evaluate
our escape options.

30:53.148 --> 30:55.550
- Does everyone understand that?
- Yes, sir!

30:55.552 --> 30:56.552
Very good.

30:57.220 --> 30:58.421
- Maxim and Niko.
- Yes!

30:58.988 --> 31:00.356
You shut down
the compartment,

31:00.656 --> 31:02.325
then you purge the main pipes,

31:02.625 --> 31:05.459
then check list,
from forward to aft.

31:05.461 --> 31:06.327
Yes, sir!

31:06.329 --> 31:08.129
Boris,
you work on the pump.

31:08.131 --> 31:09.964
- Yes, sir!
- Sasha, where are you?

31:09.966 --> 31:10.799
Get the hammer.

31:10.801 --> 31:12.099
We need to let them know
we're alive.

31:12.101 --> 31:13.002
Yes, sir!

31:14.404 --> 31:16.673
Okay, four strikes,
repeatedly...

31:17.173 --> 31:18.409
Every hour on the hour.

31:18.708 --> 31:19.909
Four strikes.

31:21.644 --> 31:26.180
Five, four, three, two, one.

31:43.032 --> 31:44.666
Get me a close up
on the Barents Sea,

31:44.668 --> 31:46.333
- north-east of Murmansk.
- Yes, sir.

31:46.335 --> 31:48.202
And bring up
maritime traffic, please.

31:48.204 --> 31:49.772
- Yes, sir.
- Bring it up now.

31:49.774 --> 31:50.907
And get me a satellite picture,

31:50.909 --> 31:53.108
get me a better satellite
picture than that, please.

31:53.110 --> 31:54.546
Yep, closer on that,
what's that?

31:55.513 --> 31:56.578
What do we have?

31:56.580 --> 31:58.580
The Russian frigates
are running grids

31:58.582 --> 32:00.282
and the rest of the fleet
is sailing

32:00.284 --> 32:01.552
in short radius circles.

32:02.419 --> 32:04.687
Seismic events?
Be more specific?

32:04.689 --> 32:07.459
One small, one large,
3.9 on the Richter,

32:07.691 --> 32:10.228
11:28 hours, two minutes apart.

32:12.262 --> 32:13.397
Mother of God.

32:14.364 --> 32:15.600
They've lost a submarine.

32:18.403 --> 32:20.569
Get me the Norsar seismic
read-outs for the Barents Sea.

32:20.571 --> 32:22.370
- Yes, sir!
- David, ask the Americans

32:22.372 --> 32:24.740
to re-route Sat-Com Three
for photos of Vidyaevo

32:24.742 --> 32:26.709
and the other Murmansk
secondary ports.

32:26.711 --> 32:27.712
Sir.

32:29.380 --> 32:30.515
Bruce,

32:31.616 --> 32:33.218
place a call to Russian
Northern Fleet headquarters.

32:33.685 --> 32:35.353
- To?
- Admiral Gruzinsky.

32:35.753 --> 32:37.821
Should I clear that with NATO
HQ first, sir?

32:37.823 --> 32:39.489
If I wanted you
to clear it first,

32:39.491 --> 32:41.092
- I would have told you so.
- Yes, sir.

32:42.293 --> 32:44.629
- Admiral on deck.
- As you were.

32:47.565 --> 32:48.566
Report?

32:48.801 --> 32:50.168
Two acoustic events.

32:50.468 --> 32:52.101
- How big?
- Unclear.

32:52.103 --> 32:53.439
Our instruments were pinned.

32:53.671 --> 32:55.273
I need location and boat.

32:56.074 --> 32:57.406
- The <i>Kursk?</i>
- Get the Dronov ready

32:57.408 --> 32:58.576
to be send down.

32:59.845 --> 33:01.279
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

33:04.850 --> 33:06.184
What are we hearing?

33:07.419 --> 33:10.120
One explosion,
then a second explosion,

33:10.122 --> 33:12.625
which was really
multiple explosions

33:13.425 --> 33:15.026
that landed
almost simultaneously.

33:15.294 --> 33:16.328
Granit missiles?

33:16.795 --> 33:18.264
It's more likely torpedoes.

33:19.331 --> 33:20.697
Any word
from the Northern Fleet?

33:20.699 --> 33:22.668
Nothing yet.
They haven't responded.

33:23.502 --> 33:24.503
Survivors?

33:26.238 --> 33:28.274
Well, there were two explosions,
very big.

33:28.707 --> 33:30.274
The American satellite
data shows

33:30.276 --> 33:32.311
the Russian rescue assets
still docked.

33:48.327 --> 33:49.563
- Mom.
- Yeah?

33:49.829 --> 33:50.829
Good or bad?

33:53.366 --> 33:56.368
They're small,
but it's good.

33:57.570 --> 33:58.705
Put them in the basket.

34:00.272 --> 34:01.408
They're very small.

34:02.475 --> 34:03.510
Baby mushrooms.

34:04.811 --> 34:06.279
We can put them in the soup.

34:22.862 --> 34:23.864
Let's go.

34:37.476 --> 34:38.812
The water is rising fast!

34:40.246 --> 34:42.313
It's up 1.5 meters!

34:42.315 --> 34:43.849
We are trying to fix it!

34:43.851 --> 34:45.217
Pass the wrench.

34:45.552 --> 34:46.819
We need more clothes!

34:46.821 --> 34:47.853
Leo, bring me the cloth.

34:47.855 --> 34:50.489
Get him some cloth!
Get him some cloth!

34:50.491 --> 34:52.591
Okay, go get me
the clamps, the clamps!

34:52.592 --> 34:53.492
Niko! Come on!

34:53.494 --> 34:55.596
Okay, clamps,
I got the clamps.

35:26.995 --> 35:28.195
Damn it!

35:31.800 --> 35:33.467
Boris, how're you doing
on the pump?

35:34.435 --> 35:36.605
- We need that pump now!
- I'm on it, I'm on it!

35:38.339 --> 35:40.475
We're connecting it
to the reserve batteries.

35:42.644 --> 35:44.245
It's on.

35:44.445 --> 35:46.446
Get the milk
and check if there is suction.

35:46.448 --> 35:47.449
Pass me the milk.

35:48.517 --> 35:49.551
Check the suction!

36:14.944 --> 36:16.979
That will slow it down
but it won't stop it.

36:19.048 --> 36:20.750
Boris, make sure
the pump stays on.

36:20.983 --> 36:22.417
We still have water coming in.

36:22.618 --> 36:23.718
Yes, sir.

36:23.720 --> 36:24.985
Niko,
go find blankets,

36:24.987 --> 36:26.221
we need to stay warm.

36:27.756 --> 36:28.858
Yes, sir.

36:34.329 --> 36:35.965
Prepare the oxygen
generator as well.

36:37.733 --> 36:39.300
Do not activate

36:39.302 --> 36:41.503
without me reviewing
the procedure with you.

36:43.539 --> 36:44.507
Leo!

36:47.376 --> 36:48.478
What's going on?

36:50.413 --> 36:52.548
- You're going to make it.
- I'm scared.

36:54.484 --> 36:56.350
Listen to me,
listen to me.

36:56.352 --> 36:58.085
Imagine you're on the surface
and your friends

36:58.087 --> 36:59.489
are trapped down here.

37:00.022 --> 37:02.493
You would move heaven
and earth to save them.

37:02.759 --> 37:04.725
Nothing would be
too much. Nothing.

37:04.727 --> 37:05.762
- Nothing.
- Right?

37:06.596 --> 37:09.833
Everything we would do for them,
they would do for us.

37:11.901 --> 37:13.670
- Yes, sir.
- Do you believe that?

37:16.639 --> 37:17.640
Okay?

37:18.608 --> 37:19.610
Yes, sir.

37:39.696 --> 37:40.764
Any audio?

37:48.906 --> 37:50.774
Sir, it's...
It's not working.

37:53.845 --> 37:56.513
We'll get it fixed.
We are almost there, sir.

38:23.107 --> 38:24.108
My God.

38:25.109 --> 38:26.377
Worse.

38:26.945 --> 38:28.880
Much worse than I expected.

38:30.448 --> 38:31.851
No one could survive that.

38:50.169 --> 38:51.403
It's the <i>Kursk...</i>

38:51.871 --> 38:52.905
Something happened.

38:53.438 --> 38:55.072
- What?
- I'm sorry.

38:55.074 --> 38:56.441
Ilina!

38:59.645 --> 39:01.780
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

39:04.616 --> 39:06.583
- Anastasia!
- I don't know what to do.

39:06.585 --> 39:08.922
- What have you heard?
- That they lost contact with it.

39:09.121 --> 39:10.954
When?
How long has it been?

39:10.956 --> 39:11.991
I don't know.

39:13.893 --> 39:15.159
I heard it's on fire.

39:15.161 --> 39:17.030
- Who told you that?
- Tisa.

39:17.230 --> 39:19.630
Danil's sister
said everything is fine.

39:19.632 --> 39:21.500
- Are they trapped?
- Who knows?

39:22.668 --> 39:23.569
What are we doing?

39:25.771 --> 39:28.106
Find Vadim.
I'll try headquarters,

39:28.108 --> 39:29.876
- see if I can find out anything.
- Okay

39:30.209 --> 39:31.778
- We'll meet at Vera's!
- Yes

39:33.846 --> 39:35.748
Don't worry.
We're finding out what happened.

39:38.851 --> 39:40.120
- Where?
- Right here.

39:44.858 --> 39:46.493
Clear the corridor!

39:48.594 --> 39:50.063
Has anything happened
to the <i>Kursk?</i>

39:50.663 --> 39:52.966
I... I don't know
anything about that.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.835
Have you heard anything?
Can you tell me?

39:56.102 --> 39:57.804
I can't tell you things
I don't know.

39:58.038 --> 40:00.538
Actually even if I did know,
I wouldn't be authorized

40:00.540 --> 40:02.042
to tell you, I'm... I'm sorry.

40:06.780 --> 40:08.114
Captain Timoshenko!

40:09.049 --> 40:10.483
- Captain!
- Yes.

40:11.718 --> 40:13.519
We heard something
happened to the <i>Kursk.</i>

40:14.955 --> 40:17.892
I was just called here
for a meeting so, excuse me.

40:34.542 --> 40:36.108
God forbid
the Navy should tell us

40:36.110 --> 40:37.244
what's happening, right?

40:37.912 --> 40:39.013
This is bullshit!

40:39.814 --> 40:40.848
So what should we do?

40:42.583 --> 40:44.485
We let the Navy
do its work.

40:44.785 --> 40:48.521
I mean, they will do anything
in their power to get them home.

40:49.190 --> 40:50.825
But we need to know
what's happening.

40:51.325 --> 40:52.525
That's... Yeah.

40:57.098 --> 41:00.065
Well, 30 years ago
when Anton was much younger

41:00.067 --> 41:01.769
than Misha is now,

41:02.104 --> 41:04.139
Anton's father
worked on the <i>Kiev.</i>

41:05.673 --> 41:07.706
There was a fire,
on the submarine

41:07.708 --> 41:10.645
and she was on the bottom
for... For three weeks.

41:11.079 --> 41:12.580
I didn't know a thing.

41:13.581 --> 41:16.918
The Navy protected me
as it saved Vadim.

41:17.651 --> 41:19.654
Their comrades
will do their duty.

41:21.022 --> 41:22.890
Your duty is to wait and hope.

41:28.797 --> 41:30.531
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

41:32.601 --> 41:34.069
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Coffee?

41:40.042 --> 41:42.544
I didn't say goodbye
to Anton when he left.

41:45.614 --> 41:47.082
I was mad because...

41:51.988 --> 41:55.155
He swore he'd fix
the broken window by the sink.

41:57.692 --> 41:59.761
I didn't even kiss him goodbye.

42:04.400 --> 42:06.935
Maybe that was our last moment
together.

42:10.339 --> 42:11.807
And I snapped at him.

42:13.642 --> 42:14.877
He knew you loved him.

42:15.978 --> 42:16.979
Knew?

42:17.814 --> 42:18.815
He knows.

42:24.954 --> 42:26.089
You have to stay strong.

42:27.023 --> 42:29.759
- We have to stay strong.
- Yeah, okay.

42:30.093 --> 42:31.227
We have no choice.

42:47.111 --> 42:48.212
Captain!

42:50.080 --> 42:51.747
Go, Misha. Go sit over there.

42:55.352 --> 42:57.785
- I'm Tanya Averina.
- Yes, I know.

42:57.787 --> 42:59.123
I know Mikhail.

42:59.822 --> 43:01.959
This is our only rescue ship,
right?

43:07.097 --> 43:09.366
If they were alive
you would be on your way.

43:13.804 --> 43:14.805
I'm sorry.

43:16.807 --> 43:17.808
I'm sorry.

43:44.402 --> 43:45.403
I have it.

43:55.812 --> 43:56.813
No oxygen.

43:57.982 --> 43:59.250
Central 02 is gone!

44:00.318 --> 44:02.153
We have to start
the oxygen generator.

44:03.288 --> 44:04.289
Oleg.

44:05.290 --> 44:06.956
We need the cartridges
to ignite the generator.

44:06.958 --> 44:08.257
- I know.
- Oleg.

44:08.259 --> 44:09.726
I know, I know.

44:30.215 --> 44:31.217
Shit.

44:31.450 --> 44:32.817
What's the matter?

44:33.452 --> 44:35.485
- We don't have any cartridges.
- What?

44:35.487 --> 44:36.954
We don't have any cartridges.

44:36.956 --> 44:38.388
Are you sure?
They must be somewhere.

44:38.390 --> 44:40.089
- We looked everywhere.
- But...

44:40.091 --> 44:42.194
- They must be somewhere!
- But, sir,

44:42.494 --> 44:44.261
there are cartridges
in Compartment Eight,

44:44.263 --> 44:45.431
in the lower section.

44:45.863 --> 44:47.266
I gave them to Timur myself.

44:48.266 --> 44:49.835
Compartment 8 is flooded.

44:52.504 --> 44:54.006
We can't go down there.

45:30.843 --> 45:32.513
Damn it. Boris.

45:33.879 --> 45:35.282
Boris, get the pump running.

45:37.284 --> 45:38.451
Let me help you.

46:00.641 --> 46:01.841
Ready.

46:10.117 --> 46:11.284
Emergency power.

46:31.506 --> 46:34.842
Fleet command,
all engines stop.

46:35.109 --> 46:36.444
Audio test confirmed.

46:37.679 --> 46:39.478
If there is anything to hear,
let's make sure we hear it.

46:39.480 --> 46:40.549
Cut the engines.

46:41.550 --> 46:42.551
Confirmed.

47:03.170 --> 47:04.272
Fifteen seconds.

47:10.545 --> 47:11.546
5,

47:12.681 --> 47:13.882
4,

47:14.616 --> 47:15.617
3,

47:16.284 --> 47:18.220
2, on the hour.

47:18.620 --> 47:19.621
Mark.

47:46.649 --> 47:48.484
Are you sure
the audio is working?

47:49.117 --> 47:52.087
Yes, sir. We've got ambient
sea noise and current flow.

47:53.088 --> 47:54.089
Nothing.

48:10.006 --> 48:11.007
Mikhail!

48:12.475 --> 48:13.476
Mikhail!

48:15.144 --> 48:17.213
We're on the hour.
Passed it.

48:18.415 --> 48:20.114
- What?
- We've passed it.

48:20.116 --> 48:21.317
We need to do the strikes.

48:22.151 --> 48:25.522
Oh. sorry, I... I sold my watch.

48:42.572 --> 48:43.574
Yes!

48:45.008 --> 48:48.645
- Get me the <i>Rudnitsky,</i> now!
- Standby. Get the <i>Rudnitsky!</i>

49:13.403 --> 49:15.172
- Tanya Averina?
- Yes.

49:15.507 --> 49:17.508
- I'm Kulkin.
- Yeah.

49:18.409 --> 49:20.477
They heard tapping
on the <i>Kursk.</i>

49:26.351 --> 49:27.519
Thank you.

49:27.852 --> 49:30.255
Marina! Marina!

49:30.454 --> 49:31.455
Daria!

49:32.190 --> 49:33.190
Daria!

49:34.124 --> 49:35.325
Marina!

49:36.293 --> 49:37.827
- What?
- They heard tapping!

49:37.829 --> 49:40.162
- What?
- They heard tapping!

49:40.164 --> 49:41.432
- Are you sure?
- Yeah!

49:41.833 --> 49:43.501
- They are alive!
- Marina!

49:43.801 --> 49:45.735
- They heard tapping!
- What's going on?

49:45.737 --> 49:49.205
They heard tapping!
The rescue service's on its way!

49:49.207 --> 49:51.173
- Tanya, are you sure?
- Really?

49:51.175 --> 49:52.308
Yes!

49:52.310 --> 49:54.245
They are alive!
They're alive!

49:54.812 --> 49:57.178
Tony, get me a live feed
from Vidyaevo satellite

49:57.180 --> 49:59.549
and keep an eye on all images
from north east of Murmansk.

49:59.551 --> 50:01.386
It's the <i>Kursk</i> that's down.

50:01.853 --> 50:03.686
A ship left Vidyaevo
two hours ago

50:03.688 --> 50:06.057
with the rescue submersible
on deck.

50:06.624 --> 50:07.758
There are survivors.

50:07.760 --> 50:09.294
Which rescue submersible?

50:09.728 --> 50:12.263
The Russians had three
functional rescue submersibles.

50:12.464 --> 50:15.197
The <i>M</i> was sold
to an American company,

50:15.199 --> 50:17.801
which uses it
to take rich tourists

50:17.803 --> 50:19.435
down to see the <i>Titanic</i>

50:19.437 --> 50:21.437
at twenty thousand dollars
a pop.

50:21.439 --> 50:23.407
The <i>A-32</i> is stuck
in the Black Sea

50:23.409 --> 50:26.376
with stabilizer problems,
which leaves the <i>Priz,</i>

50:26.378 --> 50:27.578
which is a bucket of bolts,

50:27.580 --> 50:29.315
I wouldn't trust it
in a bathtub.

50:29.848 --> 50:31.848
Have the Russians
requested our help?

50:31.850 --> 50:33.316
I've put repeated calls

50:33.318 --> 50:35.184
in to Admiral Gruzinsky
of the Northern Fleet.

50:35.186 --> 50:37.655
No response,
but he's no fool.

50:37.657 --> 50:39.923
The <i>Kur</i> has more secrets on I
than any ship in their navy.

50:39.925 --> 50:41.858
There's cryptography,
propulsion, weapons' systems.

50:41.860 --> 50:43.627
They're not going to let us
get anywhere near it.

50:43.629 --> 50:44.630
We'll see.

50:45.799 --> 50:46.831
In the meantime I want the <i>LR5</i>
prepped and loaded

50:46.833 --> 50:48.766
and ready for air transport.
And I want a list

50:48.768 --> 50:50.834
of all dive platforms
and saturation divers

50:50.836 --> 50:52.636
from the North Sea
to the coast of Finland.

50:52.638 --> 50:53.737
Yes, sir.

50:58.645 --> 51:00.145
- Kolia!
- Hurry up!

51:00.913 --> 51:02.648
You'll wait in here, okay?

51:07.954 --> 51:09.154
Hi.

51:09.522 --> 51:10.724
- No.
- Why?

51:11.390 --> 51:12.392
I said no.

51:29.944 --> 51:33.444
Let me begin by saying
that I will make all efforts

51:33.446 --> 51:36.216
to share with you
available information.

51:37.484 --> 51:40.487
That said, you must understand
there are security issues

51:40.854 --> 51:42.955
that may prevent certain
information

51:42.957 --> 51:44.825
from being shared at this time.

51:48.461 --> 51:49.597
So, the Russian Navy

51:49.863 --> 51:52.198
and in particular
the Northern Fleet,

51:52.632 --> 51:56.001
has a long and proud history
of defending our nation

51:56.003 --> 51:58.570
and the brave sailors
who's served and...

51:58.572 --> 51:59.573
- What?
- Captain?

52:00.273 --> 52:02.609
Captain,
excuse me for interrupting,

52:03.310 --> 52:04.810
but we've been told
that there is tapping

52:04.812 --> 52:06.346
from inside the <i>Kursk.</i>

52:07.548 --> 52:08.616
Is that true?

52:10.852 --> 52:12.687
I cannot speak to that issue.

52:14.989 --> 52:17.756
All I can tell you is that
the Russian Navy,

52:17.758 --> 52:19.692
and in particular
the Northern Fleet...

52:19.694 --> 52:20.695
Why can't he say anything?

52:21.696 --> 52:23.996
I'm so sorry, Captain,
but we've all come here

52:23.998 --> 52:26.533
for some information. I mean,

52:26.535 --> 52:29.468
can you tell us anything
about the tapping, please?

52:29.470 --> 52:31.204
Do you know
their condition?

52:31.840 --> 52:32.772
How much air they have?

52:32.774 --> 52:34.942
And what is being done
to save them, sir?

52:35.677 --> 52:36.711
Tell us!

52:37.778 --> 52:40.748
- How long do they have?
- Please, anything.

52:42.616 --> 52:43.752
Please, sir.

52:45.019 --> 52:46.885
- I'm sorry.
- No, please! No!

52:46.887 --> 52:47.921
I'm very sorry.

52:49.057 --> 52:50.390
I'm very sorry,

52:50.392 --> 52:52.491
but I have nothing more
to tell you.

52:54.629 --> 52:55.662
Tell us!

52:55.664 --> 52:56.898
When are they coming back?

52:57.364 --> 52:58.967
- Please!
- Captain!

52:59.734 --> 53:01.470
That's not the way
you should have acted.

53:02.771 --> 53:04.706
- They want you to trust them.
- Yeah.

53:05.007 --> 53:07.308
- What if I don't?
- You should!

53:08.309 --> 53:09.444
Excuse me.

53:17.486 --> 53:18.487
Misha?

53:51.453 --> 53:52.521
Is Dad dead?

53:54.624 --> 53:55.625
I don't know.

53:56.659 --> 53:57.761
You think he's dead.

53:59.663 --> 54:00.663
I hope he's okay.

54:02.665 --> 54:03.666
Me too.

54:38.635 --> 54:39.736
Niko?

54:43.774 --> 54:44.775
Niko.

54:48.179 --> 54:50.380
Wake up, wake up.

54:54.618 --> 54:57.118
Do you hear me?
You have to stay awake,

54:57.120 --> 54:58.555
stay with us.

55:17.008 --> 55:18.875
I have to go
through the floor hatch.

55:18.877 --> 55:21.143
- Can't be done.
- It has to be done.

55:21.145 --> 55:22.679
We need oxygen.

55:22.914 --> 55:24.415
You won't make it.

55:27.186 --> 55:28.985
- Leo!
- Yes, sir.

55:28.987 --> 55:30.720
Which locker
did he put them in?

55:30.722 --> 55:32.657
I don't know,
I left before he stowed them.

55:32.957 --> 55:35.059
- You don't know.
- Lower section!

55:39.198 --> 55:40.798
It will take some time
to find them.

55:41.633 --> 55:42.967
I need someone to come with me.

55:43.501 --> 55:45.403
Sacha! Sacha!

55:45.803 --> 55:47.572
Help me get
the oxygen cartridges.

55:51.576 --> 55:52.912
Leo, hurry up.

55:55.513 --> 55:57.949
This is a crazy plan!
It's too far!

56:05.089 --> 56:08.558
Give me your arm!
Come on! Give me your arm.

56:08.560 --> 56:09.561
All right!

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:04.867
Let me help him!

01:00:06.969 --> 01:00:09.803
Get him out of the water!
Get some blankets!

01:00:09.805 --> 01:00:12.509
Help me! Help me! Help me!

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:17.714
Come on!

01:00:19.049 --> 01:00:20.584
Mikhail, look at me!

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:26.390
- Bring him out!
- Come on!

01:00:26.857 --> 01:00:28.358
Hold on, Sasha!

01:00:29.993 --> 01:00:31.128
Come on!

01:00:35.098 --> 01:00:37.968
Sasha! You're okay!
You're okay, you're okay!

01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:42.837
Look at me, look at me!

01:00:42.839 --> 01:00:45.742
Where are the cartridges?
Where are the cartridges?

01:00:59.023 --> 01:01:00.157
Come on!

01:01:21.212 --> 01:01:24.182
Two boxes?
ten cartridges each.

01:01:24.983 --> 01:01:27.785
One down, nineteen to go.

01:01:30.188 --> 01:01:32.121
What the hell took you so long?

01:01:33.491 --> 01:01:35.125
Can you tell me that?

01:01:37.228 --> 01:01:39.962
And I forgot my trunks
down there, can you go back?

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:09.528
Watch out!

01:02:10.296 --> 01:02:11.830
Careful!

01:02:12.398 --> 01:02:14.567
Easy! Watch it!

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:17.435
- Get the lifting slings!
- Slow and easy!

01:02:17.437 --> 01:02:19.872
We need five man
port side for the maneuver.

01:02:28.013 --> 01:02:30.049
<i>Current
just over one knot.</i>

01:02:32.451 --> 01:02:34.952
<i>Battery level
eighty-five percent.</i>

01:02:34.954 --> 01:02:37.524
<i>Turnaround
at twenty-five percent.</i>

01:03:20.333 --> 01:03:23.037
- Leo! Go.
- Yes, sir.

01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:26.605
- Hey, be careful! Be careful.
- I know, I know. I know.

01:03:26.607 --> 01:03:28.640
- Be careful with this one.
- Yes, I know.

01:03:28.642 --> 01:03:31.543
Listen to me.
Have you done this in training?

01:03:31.545 --> 01:03:34.278
In theory.
But I was on a short schedule.

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:35.483
So you didn't.

01:03:36.550 --> 01:03:38.317
No water on this one.

01:03:38.319 --> 01:03:40.319
Are you listening?
No water on this one.

01:03:40.321 --> 01:03:41.286
No water.

01:03:41.288 --> 01:03:44.022
Any contact with water
and it will explode.

01:03:44.024 --> 01:03:45.491
- Yeah, big fire.
- Do you understand?

01:03:45.493 --> 01:03:47.561
Big fire.
And then what happens?

01:03:48.162 --> 01:03:50.565
- No oxygen.
- Exactly. We don't want that.

01:03:52.733 --> 01:03:55.237
- Always hold it on the top.
- Yes, sir.

01:03:59.574 --> 01:04:01.308
Okay, take the cartridge.

01:04:09.584 --> 01:04:11.118
Okay, put it in.

01:04:14.322 --> 01:04:16.425
Now bring it down.
Lock it in.

01:04:21.262 --> 01:04:22.562
<i>We'll approach it</i>

01:04:22.564 --> 01:04:24.364
<i>from just
behind the reactors.</i>

01:04:24.366 --> 01:04:26.602
<i>Then let the current
push us backward</i>

01:04:27.067 --> 01:04:29.037
<i>toward the aft
escape hatch.</i>

01:05:13.449 --> 01:05:14.618
What's that?

01:05:22.325 --> 01:05:23.459
They're here!

01:05:25.461 --> 01:05:26.563
It's them.

01:05:35.204 --> 01:05:36.571
Yeah!

01:05:36.573 --> 01:05:38.341
Yeah!

01:05:43.847 --> 01:05:45.847
Yeah!

01:06:00.497 --> 01:06:02.266
Silence! Silence!

01:06:02.466 --> 01:06:04.801
Shh. Shh. Shh.

01:06:05.202 --> 01:06:06.603
Let's listen, let's listen!

01:06:07.203 --> 01:06:08.338
Let's wait!

01:06:18.448 --> 01:06:19.614
It's not connecting.

01:06:19.616 --> 01:06:20.584
We're in position.

01:06:21.184 --> 01:06:23.086
- It's not making a seal.
- Why?

01:06:23.387 --> 01:06:25.557
Batteries
at twenty-five percent.

01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:27.458
Twenty-three.

01:06:27.758 --> 01:06:30.726
- I'm not leaving until we seal.
- Well if we die, they die.

01:06:30.728 --> 01:06:32.597
We recharge and we come back.

01:06:34.465 --> 01:06:36.798
- Blowing ballast.
- Blowing ballast on three,

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:38.269
two, one.

01:06:42.173 --> 01:06:43.373
<i>Full ahead!</i>

01:06:45.443 --> 01:06:46.444
<i>Come hard left!</i>

01:06:47.512 --> 01:06:48.344
<i>I can't hold it!
I can't hold it!</i>

01:06:48.346 --> 01:06:49.280
<i>Watch out! Watch out!</i>

01:06:53.184 --> 01:06:54.384
They hit the rudder.

01:06:55.386 --> 01:06:57.218
- They're surfacing!
- No! No! No!

01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:58.656
Yes! They're surfacing!

01:06:59.557 --> 01:07:01.324
They're surfacing!

01:07:01.326 --> 01:07:03.893
You bastards!
Come back!

01:07:03.895 --> 01:07:08.531
Come back! Come back!
Come back! Come back!

01:07:08.533 --> 01:07:09.835
Come back!

01:07:10.234 --> 01:07:13.338
Come back! Come back!

01:07:13.905 --> 01:07:15.239
Quiet!

01:07:15.473 --> 01:07:17.442
Quiet!

01:07:20.713 --> 01:07:21.814
Please listen.

01:07:23.781 --> 01:07:25.882
- They will try again!
- But... But... But, sir...

01:07:25.884 --> 01:07:27.685
But trust me! They will.

01:07:27.886 --> 01:07:29.920
But what if they
still can't attach?

01:07:29.922 --> 01:07:32.489
Let's swim to the surface,
do speed ascents.

01:07:32.491 --> 01:07:34.358
- No!
- They're right above us.

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:36.393
You've seen
the rescue ship, right?

01:07:36.395 --> 01:07:38.362
- Mikhail, we have to leave now!
- No!

01:07:38.364 --> 01:07:40.731
The rescue ship
has no decompression chamber,

01:07:40.733 --> 01:07:43.569
you will die of the bends.
You know that.

01:07:44.904 --> 01:07:46.271
You go, you die.

01:07:49.608 --> 01:07:50.743
We wait!

01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:02.755
We can't wait.

01:08:03.823 --> 01:08:06.625
We've done enough waiting.
To hell with waiting!

01:08:12.499 --> 01:08:15.434
Get the battery
charging cables from the locker!

01:08:18.370 --> 01:08:19.673
Secure that line!

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:24.643
What happened?
Why couldn't you make the seal?

01:08:26.345 --> 01:08:27.513
I don't know, sir.

01:08:27.781 --> 01:08:30.483
This is supposed to be
replaced annually.

01:08:30.684 --> 01:08:32.818
God knows how old this is.

01:08:32.819 --> 01:08:34.652
The tail is damaged.

01:08:34.654 --> 01:08:36.520
So make the repairs!

01:08:36.523 --> 01:08:37.421
Yes, sir!

01:08:37.424 --> 01:08:39.323
Change out the batteries.

01:08:39.325 --> 01:08:40.792
Let's try again. Quickly!

01:08:40.794 --> 01:08:42.429
We only have one set.

01:08:43.261 --> 01:08:46.599
- Twelve hours to recharge.
- No extra batteries?

01:08:46.866 --> 01:08:49.234
We were ordered
to sell them with the <i>Mir.</i>

01:08:50.037 --> 01:08:51.638
They're at the <i>Titanic.</i>

01:09:16.764 --> 01:09:17.765
So...

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:22.702
this little polar bear
goes to his mother and says,

01:09:23.770 --> 01:09:25.406
"I'm a polar bear, right?"

01:09:26.907 --> 01:09:28.709
And she says, "Yes, of course."

01:09:29.978 --> 01:09:32.781
And the little polar bear says,
"Okay, thanks."

01:09:35.649 --> 01:09:36.817
The next day,

01:09:38.019 --> 01:09:40.386
the little polar bear goes
to his mother again and says,

01:09:40.988 --> 01:09:42.823
"Let me see if I got this right.

01:09:43.825 --> 01:09:47.828
You're a polar bear, right?"
And she says, "Yes, of course."

01:09:48.395 --> 01:09:50.429
And then,
the little polar bear says,

01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:52.633
"And Dad's a polar bear too,
right?"

01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:55.336
And she says, "Yes, of course."

01:09:56.605 --> 01:09:59.273
And then the little polar bear
says "Okay,

01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:01.276
fine, just checking."

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:07.348
So, the next day

01:10:07.783 --> 01:10:10.786
the little polar bear goes
to his mother again and says,

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.655
"I just gotta be clear here.

01:10:14.923 --> 01:10:16.658
You're a polar bear, right?"

01:10:17.026 --> 01:10:19.594
And the mother says, "Yes."

01:10:20.595 --> 01:10:24.032
"And Dad's a polar bear, right?"
And she says, "Yes."

01:10:24.633 --> 01:10:27.036
"That makes me
a polar bear, right?"

01:10:27.536 --> 01:10:28.703
And she says, "Yes."

01:10:29.404 --> 01:10:30.939
Then the little polar bear says,

01:10:31.808 --> 01:10:35.075
- "Then why am I so..."
- "So fucking cold."

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:46.520
I'm sorry Oleg, it's just...

01:10:46.522 --> 01:10:48.655
Then why am I so fucking cold.

01:10:52.728 --> 01:10:54.161
Hell yeah, it's cold.

01:11:03.506 --> 01:11:04.874
What's taking so long?

01:11:06.142 --> 01:11:09.143
First watch, close up,
prepare to launch the sea-boat.

01:11:09.145 --> 01:11:10.077
And the collar?

01:11:10.079 --> 01:11:12.113
We're hoping
that heating it up

01:11:12.115 --> 01:11:14.182
will enable the oil to penetrate

01:11:14.184 --> 01:11:16.854
and soften it enough to attach.

01:11:17.453 --> 01:11:18.921
That's not reassuring.

01:11:26.462 --> 01:11:27.331
Carry on!

01:11:28.065 --> 01:11:29.932
The batteries
are nearly charged!

01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:47.782
- Leo!
- Yes, sir!

01:11:47.784 --> 01:11:48.852
Hammer!

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.701
Okay, okay.

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:50.013
What should I tell Moscow?

01:12:50.015 --> 01:12:51.683
I'll tell them myself.

01:13:06.064 --> 01:13:07.130
<i>Emergency center.</i>

01:13:07.132 --> 01:13:10.035
This is admiral Gruzinsky
from the Northern Fleet.

01:13:11.103 --> 01:13:14.974
I need to communicate
with Commodore David Russell.

01:13:15.941 --> 01:13:17.142
Royal Navy.

01:13:18.077 --> 01:13:19.242
<i>I'll put you through.</i>

01:13:30.956 --> 01:13:33.226
- Andrei.
- <i>David.</i>

01:13:33.959 --> 01:13:36.229
- <i>It's been too long.</i>
- It certainly has.

01:13:37.196 --> 01:13:38.564
What can I do?

01:13:40.232 --> 01:13:41.965
<i>You've seen the</i> Priz.

01:13:41.967 --> 01:13:43.802
and the <i>Mikhail Rudnitsky?</i>

01:13:44.837 --> 01:13:46.104
It's not built
for the Barents Sea,

01:13:46.106 --> 01:13:49.306
- it's built for carrying lumber.
- Do you know how many survivors?

01:13:49.308 --> 01:13:50.709
<i>Unclear.</i>

01:13:51.043 --> 01:13:53.545
<i>Perhaps 20, 25?</i>

01:13:56.015 --> 01:13:57.017
How bad is it?

01:13:58.118 --> 01:13:59.752
The compartments aft
of the reactors appear intact.

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:02.822
But everything else is gone.

01:14:03.022 --> 01:14:05.225
Is there any chance
your superiors will let us in?

01:14:06.259 --> 01:14:08.926
<i>Not until I try
a sufficient number of times</i>

01:14:08.928 --> 01:14:12.232
to do the impossible
with the inadequate.

01:14:12.966 --> 01:14:14.100
<i>I understand.</i>

01:14:14.667 --> 01:14:15.867
If there's anything I can do

01:14:15.869 --> 01:14:17.001
besides standing by,
let me know.

01:14:17.003 --> 01:14:18.972
<i>There is
one thing you could do.</i>

01:14:20.974 --> 01:14:25.110
And so we are offering
immediate deployment of the <i>LR5,</i>

01:14:25.112 --> 01:14:27.981
our state of the art
rescue submersible,

01:14:28.214 --> 01:14:30.083
and anything else
the Russians need.

01:14:30.384 --> 01:14:33.152
Sorry!
Can you tell us more about...

01:14:35.388 --> 01:14:37.121
And with Russian rescue assets

01:14:37.123 --> 01:14:39.257
apparently unable
to reach survivors,

01:14:39.259 --> 01:14:42.994
<i>offers of international
assistance are now pouring in.</i>

01:14:42.996 --> 01:14:45.763
<i>Britain and France, Norway,
and the United States</i>

01:14:45.765 --> 01:14:49.636
<i>offering both technical help
and rescue submersibles.</i>

01:14:49.837 --> 01:14:51.102
<i>And so we are offering</i>

01:14:51.104 --> 01:14:54.341
<i>immediate deployment</i>
<i>of the</i> LR5,

01:14:54.841 --> 01:14:56.741
<i>our state of the art

<i>and anything else

01:15:00.081 --> 01:15:01.346
<i>It has a potential to be</i>

01:15:01.348 --> 01:15:03.248
<i>a unique moment
of collaboration,</i>

01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:06.087
<i>sweeping aside
Cold War suspicions.</i>

01:15:06.653 --> 01:15:08.719
<i>But so far, inexplicably,</i>

01:15:08.721 --> 01:15:10.223
<i>there has been no clear
response</i>

01:15:10.225 --> 01:15:11.857
<i>from either the Kremlin,</i>

01:15:11.859 --> 01:15:13.826
<i>or the admirals
of the Northern Fleet.</i>

01:15:13.828 --> 01:15:15.961
<i>There are reasons to believe</i>

01:15:15.963 --> 01:15:18.264
<i>that the initial cause
was a collision</i>

01:15:18.266 --> 01:15:20.233
<i>with a non-Russian vessel</i>

01:15:20.235 --> 01:15:22.068
<i>with submarines
as silent as they are,</i>

01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:24.870
<i>that is, of course,
a constant danger,</i>

01:15:24.872 --> 01:15:26.905
<i>made worse, of course,</i>

01:15:26.907 --> 01:15:28.907
<i>by the aggressiveness of NATO.</i>

01:15:28.909 --> 01:15:31.177
<i>And how about
the offers of foreign help?</i>

01:15:31.179 --> 01:15:32.847
<i>Are you gonna accept them?</i>

01:15:33.115 --> 01:15:35.849
<i>Um,
that is unclear at this time.</i>

01:15:35.851 --> 01:15:37.249
<i>One more question!</i>

01:15:59.374 --> 01:16:00.974
- Have a look.
- Yes, sir.

01:16:00.976 --> 01:16:03.811
- Boris, check the batteries.
- Yes, sir.

01:16:04.846 --> 01:16:07.082
- Here.
- What is it? Hey!

01:16:09.951 --> 01:16:11.219
Batteries are dead.

01:16:11.953 --> 01:16:14.187
- That means the pump is out.
- What do you mean?

01:16:14.189 --> 01:16:15.722
Water will be rising soon.

01:16:15.724 --> 01:16:16.990
How much? Wha... What?

01:16:16.992 --> 01:16:18.892
What do we do?
What do we do?

01:16:18.894 --> 01:16:20.727
Settle down, settle down.

01:16:20.729 --> 01:16:22.831
Save your strength, save oxygen.

01:16:23.832 --> 01:16:24.967
Stay awake.

01:16:41.883 --> 01:16:43.317
Maxim, what are you doing?

01:16:43.319 --> 01:16:45.255
Let's leave. We need to leave.

01:16:46.789 --> 01:16:48.824
We should have done this
a long time ago.

01:16:50.859 --> 01:16:53.294
Maxim, get down from there,
come back here!

01:16:53.296 --> 01:16:54.997
Maxim, get down from there!

01:16:55.464 --> 01:16:56.866
Maxim!

01:16:57.967 --> 01:16:59.466
Maxim,
you're gonna kill everyone!

01:16:59.468 --> 01:17:00.970
Come back!

01:17:02.506 --> 01:17:04.740
Get down! Get down!

01:17:13.317 --> 01:17:16.752
Stop it! Stop it, stop it!

01:17:23.259 --> 01:17:24.428
Stop it!

01:17:30.133 --> 01:17:31.201
Maxim!

01:17:36.807 --> 01:17:37.938
Come back down!

01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:39.444
Stop it, man.

01:17:40.877 --> 01:17:43.146
Maxim,
we're gonna drown! Come on!

01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:17.246
And that's why I believe
we should accept

01:18:17.248 --> 01:18:19.550
the British and Norwegian
offers of help.

01:18:20.418 --> 01:18:22.985
The survivors are only
in the aft section of the boat.

01:18:22.987 --> 01:18:26.022
We can limit foreign divers
and submersibles to that area.

01:18:26.024 --> 01:18:27.256
<i>Those young men knew</i>

01:18:27.258 --> 01:18:28.427
<i>what they were signing up for.</i>

01:18:29.694 --> 01:18:30.726
Yes, sir. Those young men knew
what they were signing up for

01:18:30.728 --> 01:18:33.429
when they joined the Navy,
but did their wives?

01:18:33.431 --> 01:18:35.097
<i>You have your orders.</i>

01:18:35.099 --> 01:18:36.502
<i>No foreign interference.</i>

01:18:38.002 --> 01:18:40.171
Very well, sir.

01:18:41.072 --> 01:18:42.241
I understand.

01:18:47.345 --> 01:18:48.380
Marina!

01:18:51.283 --> 01:18:53.319
Let's go down.
Where is Vera?

01:18:54.153 --> 01:18:56.920
She'll meet us there.
Yeah. Marina?

01:18:56.922 --> 01:18:58.388
I'm coming! I'm coming,

01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:59.991
- two minutes!
- Yup, hurry up!

01:19:03.995 --> 01:19:05.562
Attention, everyone.

01:19:05.564 --> 01:19:07.266
Admiral Petrenko.

01:19:10.569 --> 01:19:14.206
I know this is
a very difficult time for you.

01:19:15.974 --> 01:19:18.342
Speaking for myself
and the President

01:19:18.344 --> 01:19:21.178
I want to assure you that
we are doing everything

01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:22.381
in our power

01:19:22.915 --> 01:19:25.951
to bring up the men
still on the <i>Kursk.</i>

01:19:26.185 --> 01:19:29.019
To that effect,
I will list the ships

01:19:29.021 --> 01:19:30.923
that are on the scene.

01:19:31.157 --> 01:19:34.293
The flagship,
<i>Peter the Great,</i>

01:19:34.494 --> 01:19:37.928
the rescue vessel
<i>Mikhail Rudnitsky...</i>

01:19:37.930 --> 01:19:39.865
Admiral, Admiral...

01:19:41.934 --> 01:19:44.104
What is... What is the status
of the crew?

01:19:44.571 --> 01:19:46.573
Are you in communication
with them?

01:19:47.005 --> 01:19:48.439
And who is alive?

01:19:48.441 --> 01:19:50.343
Yeah, who is alive?

01:19:51.009 --> 01:19:52.511
Are they injured?

01:19:52.712 --> 01:19:54.547
And... And what about
the foreign help?

01:19:56.281 --> 01:19:57.615
Have you accepted it?

01:19:57.617 --> 01:19:59.250
If you let me continue,

01:19:59.252 --> 01:20:01.053
I will give you specifics.

01:20:01.321 --> 01:20:04.355
The offers of foreign assistance
are being considered.

01:20:04.357 --> 01:20:06.893
Meanwhile,
here is what we know.

01:20:07.226 --> 01:20:10.598
The <i>Kursk</i> is intact
and on the sea bed.

01:20:11.231 --> 01:20:14.599
It is in a very difficult
position,

01:20:14.601 --> 01:20:18.371
and a... At the depth
of five hundred meters,

01:20:18.571 --> 01:20:22.073
- and almost zero visibility.
- Oh, no.

01:20:22.075 --> 01:20:23.675
At a very steep angle...

01:20:23.677 --> 01:20:24.678
- No.
- What?

01:20:25.813 --> 01:20:26.879
...and with strong
underwater current...

01:20:26.881 --> 01:20:29.449
The Barents Sea
is nowhere near that deep.

01:20:29.650 --> 01:20:31.484
Visibility is like glass.

01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:34.318
...and we are confident

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.053
that our search and rescue
personnel...

01:20:36.055 --> 01:20:37.991
The... The Barents Sea
is not that deep

01:20:38.558 --> 01:20:41.095
and visibility
is not what you say.

01:20:41.327 --> 01:20:43.564
Are you an expert
on underwater rescue?

01:20:44.197 --> 01:20:46.063
- No!
- No, then leave this

01:20:46.065 --> 01:20:47.433
to those who are.

01:20:47.435 --> 01:20:51.705
I am not an expert,
but I am not a fool either.

01:20:52.506 --> 01:20:55.073
- None of us are.
- No.

01:20:55.075 --> 01:20:57.176
Okay? None of us are!

01:20:57.178 --> 01:20:58.647
You shouldn't lie!

01:21:00.181 --> 01:21:01.581
You're lying to us!

01:21:01.583 --> 01:21:03.182
How dare you?

01:21:03.184 --> 01:21:04.985
I ask you the same question.

01:21:05.586 --> 01:21:07.455
We have children here.

01:21:08.122 --> 01:21:09.190
We...

01:21:10.057 --> 01:21:11.125
We have husbands!

01:21:12.259 --> 01:21:15.060
Your husbands and sons
are sailors in the Russian Navy.

01:21:15.062 --> 01:21:16.663
Every one of them took an oath

01:21:16.665 --> 01:21:19.266
to defend his country
with his life.

01:21:19.601 --> 01:21:22.469
The rescuers at the scene
are doing all they can.

01:21:22.471 --> 01:21:26.274
They are well-equipped
with the latest technology,

01:21:26.507 --> 01:21:29.209
equal to or
even superior

01:21:29.211 --> 01:21:30.743
to anything offered
by foreign nations.

01:21:30.745 --> 01:21:32.211
That... That's nonsense,

01:21:32.213 --> 01:21:34.481
That's nonsense
and everyone knows it!

01:21:34.483 --> 01:21:36.182
Sit down and listen!

01:21:37.486 --> 01:21:39.552
Anger and disrespect
serve no purpose.

01:21:39.554 --> 01:21:42.088
My husband...
My husband served

01:21:42.090 --> 01:21:44.559
the Northern Fleet.
We are Navy.

01:21:45.159 --> 01:21:47.460
We raised our son to be Navy,
for what?

01:21:47.462 --> 01:21:49.530
To die? For nothing?

01:21:49.532 --> 01:21:52.667
Calm down or you will be removed
from this hall!

01:21:53.068 --> 01:21:54.802
Tell us if they are still alive

01:21:54.804 --> 01:21:58.104
or how long they have
before they die!

01:21:58.106 --> 01:21:59.607
Calm down
or you will be removed,

01:21:59.609 --> 01:22:01.307
you will be removed from here.

01:22:01.309 --> 01:22:04.110
- She is right!
- Calm down...

01:22:04.112 --> 01:22:07.113
No!
No, there is no time for this!

01:22:07.115 --> 01:22:11.150
You... You want our men to die
for nothing.

01:22:11.152 --> 01:22:13.789
To hell with you!
To hell with you!

01:22:14.489 --> 01:22:16.489
You, you go to hell!

01:22:16.491 --> 01:22:19.529
You, and your admirals,
and your bureaucrats,

01:22:20.463 --> 01:22:23.332
to hell with you,
it's where you have put us

01:22:23.633 --> 01:22:25.735
and our families
and our children,

01:22:27.203 --> 01:22:28.771
and we just want justice!

01:22:29.873 --> 01:22:31.705
What did you do to her?

01:22:31.707 --> 01:22:33.409
What did you do to her?

01:22:36.178 --> 01:22:38.748
Leave her alone!
Leave her alone.

01:22:40.416 --> 01:22:42.583
Shame!
Shame on you!

01:23:26.229 --> 01:23:27.297
David?

01:23:28.732 --> 01:23:31.466
I'd like to take you up
on your offer of assistance.

01:23:31.468 --> 01:23:34.404
- What changed?
- <i>I don't know. Me?</i>

01:23:36.373 --> 01:23:38.707
I'll pull divers from
one of the Norwegian rigs

01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:40.442
at the Asgard oil fields.

01:23:40.444 --> 01:23:42.912
They can rendezvous with the <i>LR5</i>
and me in Trondheim, Norway.

01:23:42.914 --> 01:23:44.881
From there it's eleven hours
to the accident site.

01:23:51.656 --> 01:23:53.457
- Graham.
- David.

01:23:53.825 --> 01:23:55.458
This is Commodore David Russell.

01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:56.892
We're working for him
on this one.

01:23:56.894 --> 01:23:58.494
It's very good
to meet you gentlemen,

01:23:58.496 --> 01:24:00.495
- I appreciate what you're doing.
- Thank you, sir.

01:24:00.497 --> 01:24:01.633
Right, before
you're going into the chamber

01:24:02.767 --> 01:24:03.633
I have a little paperwork.
You're being asked to sign

01:24:03.635 --> 01:24:05.367
special waiver forms,
agreeing to dive

01:24:05.369 --> 01:24:06.671
without a hyperbaric lifeboat

01:24:06.872 --> 01:24:08.772
and not to hold
the Stolt Corporation liable

01:24:08.774 --> 01:24:11.407
in the event of injury
or death related to or caused by

01:24:11.409 --> 01:24:13.645
nuclear radiation
or weapons of war.

01:24:40.739 --> 01:24:42.608
No Admiral Petrenko?

01:24:42.975 --> 01:24:44.376
He sent me.

01:24:44.643 --> 01:24:47.277
So you have taken over
my command.

01:24:47.279 --> 01:24:49.682
Yes, of the rescue operation.

01:24:49.948 --> 01:24:52.651
And pending formal transfer
of command,

01:24:53.251 --> 01:24:54.651
the Northern Fleet.

01:24:54.653 --> 01:24:57.688
<i>First engineer,
contact the engine room.</i>

01:24:57.690 --> 01:25:00.257
This is Commodore David Russell
of the Royal Navy.

01:25:00.259 --> 01:25:02.391
I am aboard the <i>Seaway Eagle.</i>

01:25:02.393 --> 01:25:04.394
We are here at the request
of Admiral Gruzinsky.

01:25:04.396 --> 01:25:06.764
We're requesting permission
to approach the accident site,

01:25:06.766 --> 01:25:07.900
over.

01:25:10.736 --> 01:25:12.602
<i>You're to maintain
your current position</i>

01:25:12.604 --> 01:25:14.440
<i>until further orders.</i>

01:25:20.779 --> 01:25:22.381
Stop the engines.

01:26:38.659 --> 01:26:39.827
Mikhail.

01:26:41.061 --> 01:26:42.329
What is it?

01:26:42.731 --> 01:26:43.998
I need a pen...

01:26:44.799 --> 01:26:46.000
I have a pen.

01:26:58.079 --> 01:26:59.948
What is it?
Tell me.

01:27:01.715 --> 01:27:04.686
How old were you
when your father died?

01:27:06.754 --> 01:27:07.923
I was three.

01:27:08.924 --> 01:27:10.025
You know that.

01:27:12.027 --> 01:27:13.492
What have...

01:27:13.494 --> 01:27:16.531
What do you...
What do you remember about him?

01:27:22.037 --> 01:27:23.537
Tell me honestly.

01:27:24.973 --> 01:27:26.075
Nothing.

01:27:26.675 --> 01:27:27.676
Nothing.

01:27:33.682 --> 01:27:34.916
Misha will...

01:27:35.951 --> 01:27:39.052
Will have only a very vague
memory of me.

01:27:39.054 --> 01:27:40.121
No.

01:27:52.901 --> 01:27:54.736
The baby...

01:27:57.073 --> 01:27:58.908
The baby will have none.

01:27:59.474 --> 01:28:01.543
No, that's not true.

01:28:02.144 --> 01:28:03.713
I can feel my father.

01:28:06.748 --> 01:28:09.952
I know my mother loved him,
and I know he loved me.

01:28:11.586 --> 01:28:12.788
And somehow...

01:28:13.455 --> 01:28:15.458
he's always been a part of me...

01:28:15.691 --> 01:28:17.960
I think I need to tell him that.

01:28:20.663 --> 01:28:21.697
Thank you.

01:29:01.838 --> 01:29:04.606
This is Graham Mann,
he heads up our dive team.

01:29:04.608 --> 01:29:07.809
Admiral Einar Skorgen,
NATO Commander North Norway.

01:29:07.811 --> 01:29:10.679
He's been instrumental
in getting all of this going.

01:29:10.681 --> 01:29:12.714
Now, here's a...
A list of things

01:29:12.716 --> 01:29:14.184
we need to attend to.

01:29:14.818 --> 01:29:16.518
Including your site surveys

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:18.220
and photographs
of the accident site...

01:29:18.222 --> 01:29:20.722
We also need detailed specs
on the hatch...

01:29:20.724 --> 01:29:24.093
All in good time,
all in good time.

01:29:24.095 --> 01:29:28.765
Admiral, with all due respect,
surely time is of the essence.

01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:30.699
Yes.

01:29:30.701 --> 01:29:32.268
Well, we need to send down
our ROVs

01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:34.103
for a preliminary
radiation check,

01:29:34.105 --> 01:29:35.905
- a site survey and...
- I think there's been

01:29:35.907 --> 01:29:37.973
a misunderstanding
regarding this meeting.

01:29:37.975 --> 01:29:39.175
- What?
- The Russian

01:29:39.177 --> 01:29:42.844
rescue assets are in position
and functioning very well.

01:29:42.846 --> 01:29:44.679
Tomorrow the decision
will be made

01:29:44.681 --> 01:29:46.249
whether you and your men
will be allowed

01:29:46.251 --> 01:29:48.584
to participate in the operation.

01:29:48.586 --> 01:29:50.921
What the hell did we
come all this way for then if...

01:29:51.322 --> 01:29:52.922
Admiral, let me be frank.

01:29:52.924 --> 01:29:54.991
We have the divers
and the equipment

01:29:54.993 --> 01:29:56.826
to start bringing those men
to the surface,

01:29:56.828 --> 01:29:58.197
in a matter of hours.

01:29:58.696 --> 01:29:59.997
Now, we don't know
their condition,

01:29:59.999 --> 01:30:01.932
I implore you
to accept our help,

01:30:01.934 --> 01:30:03.265
if there are survivors,

01:30:03.267 --> 01:30:05.201
we can bring them
to the surface very quickly.

01:30:05.203 --> 01:30:07.105
I believe we've been very clear.

01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:10.272
When we reconvene,

01:30:10.274 --> 01:30:13.044
if your help is needed,
we will let you know.

01:30:17.915 --> 01:30:19.584
We look forward to your call.

01:30:26.090 --> 01:30:27.559
Why are they stalling?

01:30:28.027 --> 01:30:29.993
They're protecting
their naval secrets.

01:30:29.995 --> 01:30:32.530
And trying to avoid
national humiliation.

01:30:32.898 --> 01:30:35.232
It's not humiliating
to lose their flagship sub?

01:30:35.234 --> 01:30:38.035
- Not if they can blame it on us.
- A collision

01:30:38.037 --> 01:30:39.736
or us not saving them?

01:30:39.738 --> 01:30:42.141
- Maybe both.
- So what?

01:30:42.841 --> 01:30:43.842
We wait?

01:30:44.743 --> 01:30:46.112
We wait.

01:30:47.146 --> 01:30:48.714
And the men at the bottom?

01:30:50.716 --> 01:30:52.017
They wait too.

01:31:24.083 --> 01:31:25.285
Christ!

01:31:35.962 --> 01:31:37.861
- I can't hold it.
- We're missing it,

01:31:37.863 --> 01:31:39.964
we're missing it.
Let's go for another attempt.

01:31:39.966 --> 01:31:41.768
Okay. Turning around.

01:31:42.403 --> 01:31:44.838
Coming back.
Placing a mark.

01:31:47.373 --> 01:31:49.107
Battery level's
twenty-five percent.

01:31:49.109 --> 01:31:50.377
We're staying.

01:32:33.888 --> 01:32:35.723
Battery level's twelve percent.

01:32:40.262 --> 01:32:41.760
Battery level's at nine percent.

01:32:41.762 --> 01:32:43.462
Push it down, push it down.

01:32:43.464 --> 01:32:45.000
Eight percent.

01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:54.775
What... Keep it!

01:32:56.011 --> 01:32:58.914
Don't move it, keep it still!

01:33:05.053 --> 01:33:07.153
- You're moving!
- Battery level's at 7 percent.

01:33:07.155 --> 01:33:09.856
We have to abort now!
Abort!

01:33:15.763 --> 01:33:19.034
Blowing ballast. Rising.

01:33:29.778 --> 01:33:31.178
Ascending.

01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:33.181
<i>Do you hear tapping?</i>

01:33:33.815 --> 01:33:36.151
No. No tapping.

01:33:48.029 --> 01:33:49.998
Send in the Brits at dawn.

01:33:52.335 --> 01:33:53.901
Prepare for the maneuvering!

01:33:53.903 --> 01:33:56.339
Sir! We're on tomorrow morning!

01:33:57.006 --> 01:33:58.339
Get the divers at depth,

01:33:58.341 --> 01:34:01.275
- prepped and ready.
- Secure locks, starboard.

01:34:01.277 --> 01:34:03.145
Okay. Yeah, confirm!

01:34:06.515 --> 01:34:08.484
Hey, friend.

01:34:09.052 --> 01:34:10.286
Don't leave me.

01:34:11.488 --> 01:34:12.522
Stay with me.

01:34:20.931 --> 01:34:22.397
What the hell is this?

01:34:22.399 --> 01:34:24.767
Jesus Christ...

01:34:26.836 --> 01:34:28.305
I don't know about
the rest of you...

01:34:30.007 --> 01:34:31.841
but I'm not ready to die.

01:34:46.088 --> 01:34:47.422
Good morning, <i>Kursk!</i>

01:34:47.424 --> 01:34:49.024
Good morning!

01:34:49.026 --> 01:34:51.328
Breakfast is about to be served.

01:34:52.296 --> 01:34:54.298
- Leo, help me out.
- Okay.

01:35:02.307 --> 01:35:04.441
Okay, everybody, wake up!

01:35:05.976 --> 01:35:08.376
Show me what you have, and, uh,

01:35:08.378 --> 01:35:11.547
let's gather a nice
morning buffet!

01:35:13.650 --> 01:35:16.486
Come on, Sasha,
what do you have there?

01:35:17.088 --> 01:35:18.286
Some tuna.

01:35:18.288 --> 01:35:19.924
Oh, nice, seafood!

01:35:22.327 --> 01:35:24.025
- You've got some meat?
- Yes.

01:35:24.027 --> 01:35:25.094
Biscuits?

01:35:25.096 --> 01:35:26.395
- Pizza crackers?
- Hey!

01:35:26.397 --> 01:35:29.198
- Crackers?
- Leo.

01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:33.034
What do you have, guys?
Yes. That's Sasha!

01:35:33.036 --> 01:35:35.204
- Never is good enough.
- Listen, shut up.

01:35:35.206 --> 01:35:37.306
- What a coincidence.
- A tuna.

01:35:37.308 --> 01:35:39.008
You're thinking
about food right now.

01:35:39.010 --> 01:35:40.310
Oleg!

01:35:40.312 --> 01:35:42.146
What's up?

01:35:48.052 --> 01:35:50.052
- Oh, crackers!
- This is good!

01:35:50.054 --> 01:35:52.555
Yeah! Finally the Navy does
something right!

01:35:57.696 --> 01:35:59.997
- Niko...
- Oh, that's good.

01:36:00.599 --> 01:36:03.335
- No, get out of here.
- Where is it?

01:36:05.504 --> 01:36:06.570
Ah ha!

01:36:07.639 --> 01:36:09.207
Real breakfast!

01:36:09.675 --> 01:36:12.509
- I got some more of that.
- Oh, yeah!

01:36:12.511 --> 01:36:14.979
- Can I get some?
- Ah!

01:36:15.314 --> 01:36:19.248
- Oh! Keeps us warm.
- Oh, my God.

01:36:19.250 --> 01:36:21.520
This is really good, huh?

01:36:22.154 --> 01:36:24.922
Maxim, look at this!

01:36:25.624 --> 01:36:27.593
There's everything here!

01:36:30.161 --> 01:36:32.061
Do we actually
want to go up or what?

01:36:32.063 --> 01:36:33.598
No! No!

01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:36.166
Not yet!
We're not done down here!

01:36:36.168 --> 01:36:37.968
Should I tell
my polar bear joke again?

01:36:37.970 --> 01:36:40.705
- Yes! No!
- Yes, yes, yes.

01:36:40.707 --> 01:36:43.273
Okay, shut up this time, Boris!

01:36:44.477 --> 01:36:49.247
So, this little polar bear
goes to his mother and says...

01:36:49.249 --> 01:36:51.481
No, no, here, here,
have a drink instead.

01:36:54.353 --> 01:36:58.223
Leo, not to blame you,
you little piece of shit...

01:36:59.692 --> 01:37:02.528
Leo, Leo! Be careful!!

01:38:42.764 --> 01:38:45.132
Wake up! Wake up!

01:38:45.333 --> 01:38:49.070
Come on, wake him up!

01:38:52.273 --> 01:38:53.508
Listen...

01:38:56.177 --> 01:38:59.245
- How long do we have?
- Take it easy...

01:38:59.247 --> 01:39:00.580
A couple of minutes.

01:39:21.770 --> 01:39:23.406
It's been an honor...

01:39:24.707 --> 01:39:26.574
to serve with all of you.

01:39:26.576 --> 01:39:28.475

We're on! Ready to go!

01:40:22.699 --> 01:40:25.299
Let's go!
Okay, keep it moving',

01:40:25.301 --> 01:40:26.333
check this oxygen, will you?

01:40:26.335 --> 01:40:27.502
Divers at depth?

01:40:27.504 --> 01:40:28.803
Prepped for hundred
and six meters.

01:40:28.805 --> 01:40:30.773
- Come on, let's go!
- In position?

01:40:30.775 --> 01:40:31.840
Move it!

01:40:34.244 --> 01:40:36.747
Ready? Take the slack!

01:40:37.648 --> 01:40:39.483
It's locked.

01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:31.500
<i>We need to make sure
that hatch chamber</i>

01:41:31.502 --> 01:41:32.637
<i>is not flooded.</i>

01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:37.308
Copy that.

01:41:37.943 --> 01:41:39.542
We'll need to open
the pressure valve

01:41:39.544 --> 01:41:41.546
and see if there is
any suction.

01:42:04.937 --> 01:42:07.005
<i>Hatch chamber is flooded.</i>

01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:54.081
No survivors.

01:44:46.534 --> 01:44:49.004
My Mikhail said
that "Those who've gone to sea

01:44:49.704 --> 01:44:51.172
are forever changed."

01:44:52.707 --> 01:44:55.710
He said that's why they're
different from the rest of us,

01:44:56.811 --> 01:45:00.016
tied one to the other,
by the sea.

01:45:02.218 --> 01:45:05.720
That's why sailors
rescue sailors...

01:45:07.722 --> 01:45:08.925
even at war.

01:45:10.259 --> 01:45:11.961
I don't know if we're at war.

01:45:15.231 --> 01:45:18.700
The men of the <i>Kursk</i>
can't tell us what they think.

01:45:19.501 --> 01:45:21.704
But before he died,
my husband,

01:45:22.071 --> 01:45:23.940
wrote a letter to me,

01:45:25.107 --> 01:45:26.575
to our son,

01:45:27.643 --> 01:45:29.575
and to our unborn child.

01:45:32.547 --> 01:45:34.583
"No one has forever...

01:45:37.119 --> 01:45:38.854
but I wanted more...

01:45:40.990 --> 01:45:45.028
I wanted to give you more,
more babies.

01:45:48.597 --> 01:45:50.634
Love our son and the baby.

01:45:51.901 --> 01:45:53.136
For both of us.

01:45:54.237 --> 01:45:57.473
Tell them again and again

01:45:58.709 --> 01:46:01.144
that I love them,
as I loved you.

01:46:02.845 --> 01:46:05.581
Find another man to love,

01:46:06.216 --> 01:46:07.784
but love me, as well.

01:46:08.986 --> 01:46:10.220
For though I am,

01:46:11.722 --> 01:46:13.256
but a moment for you,

01:46:14.057 --> 01:46:15.592
you are my forever."

01:48:48.948 --> 01:48:50.384
Misha Averin!

01:49:06.133 --> 01:49:08.903
Well done, the church.

01:49:11.037 --> 01:49:12.673
I have something here.

01:49:19.313 --> 01:49:21.114
It was your father's.

01:49:26.753 --> 01:49:28.055
Thank you.

01:49:32.193 --> 01:49:33.427
Thank you.

01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:50.245
Mom?
