Hey Fez. Hey girl holding Fez's hand
who I've never seen before in my life

00:12.269 --> 00:16.088
- Everyone, meet Hilary, my girlfriend.
- Hi guys !

00:16.329 --> 00:18.937
Is she really your girlfriend Fez ?

00:19.417 --> 00:24.177
Or did you just find her wandering from a scene of
an accident and... tell her she's your girlfriend ?

00:24.677 --> 00:28.417
No, this one's real.
See, no scratches.

00:37.728 --> 00:40.608
Uhm, a little privacy please.

00:41.228 --> 00:42.908
You want privacy ?

00:43.088 --> 00:45.008
You spy on me and Randy all the time.

00:45.208 --> 00:48.288
Donna, I like to watch.

00:48.748 --> 00:51.380
I don't like being watched.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.069
That is just creepy.

00:54.420 --> 00:58.100
You know, creepy is when you open the
closet door and throw a shoe at me

00:58.154 --> 01:01.388
and tell me to get out of the way so that
you can get a better view of Donna.

01:04.319 --> 01:08.152
Hey. I'm looking for Samantha.

01:08.637 --> 01:10.670
- Who are you ?
- I'm her husband.

01:12.997 --> 01:14.333
Sam !

01:16.158 --> 01:18.353
- Larry ?
- Samantha.

01:19.018 --> 01:21.212
Uh, this guy just said he was your husband

01:21.317 --> 01:23.892
which is a little off-putting because

01:24.295 --> 01:25.893
I'm your husband.

01:26.755 --> 01:28.710
I can explain this.

01:30.377 --> 01:32.850
You're both my husband.

01:34.138 --> 01:35.513
Wow, Hyde,

01:35.917 --> 01:39.950
I bet when you married a stripper, this was not
the kind of threesome you expected.

02:21.797 --> 02:25.512
So when you and I got married, you were
already married to another guy ?

02:25.798 --> 02:27.872
Sort of.

02:28.136 --> 02:30.511
Sort of ? There's no sort of a marriage.

02:30.618 --> 02:35.551
When you say I do, you mean I do wanna marry you,
not I do already have another husband.

02:35.777 --> 02:38.951
Hey, everybody, Hyde's part of a boy harem.

02:41.345 --> 02:46.103
Look, Hyde. Larry was a regular at the club
and one day he asked me to marry him.

02:46.328 --> 02:50.862
He said he'd rent me an apartment and buy me a
Camaro, what was I supposed to say ?

02:51.908 --> 02:53.880
How about: "no...

02:54.068 --> 02:56.651
you creepy-eighty-year old looser."

02:57.018 --> 03:00.292
Hey, nobody talks to Larry Lenan like that.

03:00.398 --> 03:02.611
- Shut up Larry !
- Sorry.

03:05.535 --> 03:11.291
Then I met you and I fell in love. I figured we'd
just leave town and I'd never see him again.

03:11.536 --> 03:15.170
Luckily for me, you kept using my credit card.

03:16.307 --> 03:19.721
Which expires in a month.
I got you a new one in the car.

03:24.447 --> 03:25.803
So...

03:26.728 --> 03:33.623
If she was married to him, before she married you,
then you guys aren't even legally married.

03:33.768 --> 03:35.382
Which means...

03:35.948 --> 03:38.683
this is freaking hilarious !

03:44.996 --> 03:46.231
Red,

03:46.958 --> 03:49.911
I just heard some bad news.
I run over to tell you.

03:50.098 --> 03:52.971
Bob, you live next door. What are you panting ?

03:54.247 --> 03:56.583
I was going against the wind.

03:58.706 --> 04:01.481
They are opening a Muffler Master
right here in Point Place.

04:01.527 --> 04:03.463
- What ?
- Oh, jeez.

04:03.918 --> 04:06.872
My shop barely survives as it is.

04:07.177 --> 04:09.542
Muffler Master is not going to
drive you out of town.

04:09.718 --> 04:11.073
They're a big chain.

04:11.128 --> 04:15.133
They're always throwing their weight around,
crashing unmeaning and smaller than themselves.

04:15.277 --> 04:18.713
They're like Bob at a cup scout pancakes breakfast.

04:20.875 --> 04:26.193
Well, they are just a faceless corporation.
You have something they don't,

04:26.276 --> 04:29.710
a friendly smiling face behind the counter.

04:31.416 --> 04:33.692
When did you hire a new guy ?

04:34.895 --> 04:39.553
This town needs to know that there is a friendly
neighborhood muffler man that they can go to.

04:39.618 --> 04:41.333
So you should have a sale.

04:41.506 --> 04:46.231
No ! A sale-bretion !

04:46.408 --> 04:47.940
I'll make muffins.

04:48.388 --> 04:50.641
You can give one away with each muffler.

04:50.745 --> 04:58.461
Just don't sell more than 12 mufflers because
Jodie Alterman still has my other tin.

05:03.456 --> 05:04.692
See you later alligator.

05:04.777 --> 05:07.670
After a while you big baboon.

05:10.928 --> 05:12.861
Unbelievable.

05:13.007 --> 05:15.680
Fez has Hilary. You have Randy.

05:15.828 --> 05:18.200
Now Steven's wife has two husbands.

05:18.447 --> 05:22.200
Why am I alone and all these stupid
less attractive people are happy ?

05:24.007 --> 05:26.561
Ugly people need love too.

05:30.447 --> 05:32.703
Just like bitches.

05:37.785 --> 05:38.932
I need a boyfriend.

05:39.308 --> 05:44.141
But I don't want to end up with someone as stupid as
Michael or someone who's wrong for me as Steven.

05:44.525 --> 05:47.281
Ohhh, I know, I'm gonna write up a list.

05:47.408 --> 05:51.341
Write down everything I want in a man
and then find a guy who matches up.

05:51.926 --> 05:55.560
I did that once. But with candy.

05:57.566 --> 06:00.263
Okay, what do I want in a guy.

06:01.208 --> 06:03.660
Olympic gold medallist.

06:04.448 --> 06:07.400
Someone who doesn't talk to the hell.

06:07.807 --> 06:11.041
Ooh, who doesn't look like Eric.

06:11.987 --> 06:13.022
Jackie,

06:13.125 --> 06:17.661
if you're serious about that list, maybe you should
pick qualities that are a little more realistic.

06:18.068 --> 06:20.841
Oh you're right, you're right.

06:21.405 --> 06:24.100
No faties, no baldies.

06:33.725 --> 06:37.083
What are you still doing here ? I thought you'd be
half way to Vegas by now with your husband.

06:37.246 --> 06:38.601
You're my husband.

06:38.867 --> 06:41.700
No, I'm the guy you married
because you were bored.

06:41.965 --> 06:44.780
Next time, try tennis, you lunatic.

06:45.005 --> 06:48.702
Hey, that's our wife you're talking about.

06:48.888 --> 06:51.502
- Shut up Larry.
- Sorry.

06:52.647 --> 06:55.721
Hyde, for what it's worth, I don't love Larry.

06:56.488 --> 06:57.543
I love you.

06:57.855 --> 07:01.513
Oh, great. You love me more than
you love your grand father.

07:02.077 --> 07:06.032
Well, I'll have you know. I won't
be gone without a fight.

07:06.155 --> 07:09.691
- Shut up Larry !
- Without a fight it is !

07:19.015 --> 07:22.213
Red, I'm sorry that business is so slow.

07:22.378 --> 07:26.730
I blame myself, I used margarine instead of butter in the muffins.

07:27.297 --> 07:30.771
I ruined us to save 8 cents.

07:31.777 --> 07:37.191
- Red, I told you, you should listen to me.
- I'm not renting a promotional monkey !

07:38.578 --> 07:39.751
No !

07:40.396 --> 07:44.430
No, you should turn this place into
an adult bookstore.

07:45.195 --> 07:48.473
Those places are packed 24 hours a day.

07:48.735 --> 07:51.813
Sometimes you can't even get to the good stuff.

07:54.456 --> 08:00.952
Oh, oh, Red ! A customer. Now you show him that you
have the personal touch that Muffler Master doesn't.

08:01.175 --> 08:04.453
And if that's doesn't work, tell him you have a fake leg.

08:04.876 --> 08:09.931
There's an elderly at the hospital who has a fake
leg and he just gets whatever he wants.

08:12.316 --> 08:15.090
- Can I help you ?
- Yeah, I need a muffler.

08:15.278 --> 08:18.290
And I'm appreciate in the business.
I mean sure,

08:18.427 --> 08:20.631
Muffler Master can give you half off but,

08:20.715 --> 08:24.491
here at Forman and Son, you get personalized
home town service with a smile.

08:24.786 --> 08:25.621
Half off ?

08:25.845 --> 08:27.881
What am I doing here ?

08:28.985 --> 08:30.020
Hey !

08:30.266 --> 08:33.422
What about my damn service with a smile ?

08:35.086 --> 08:37.600
I have a fake leg !

08:38.426 --> 08:43.121
Ok, stop everything. I finished my perfect man list.

08:43.184 --> 08:46.781
And all the pieces of my life are falling into place.

08:47.385 --> 08:49.641
Oh would you just shush and listen ?

08:49.926 --> 08:52.900
Okay, first he has to be a gentleman.

08:53.226 --> 08:56.443
Just like my Fezie. He's always
opening doors for me.

08:56.648 --> 09:00.002
That way I can walk behind her
and the view is better.

09:01.485 --> 09:06.820
- Ok, my ideal guy has a great sense of humor.
- Oh, that's like Fez too.

09:06.905 --> 09:09.261
Just this morning he told me the
funniest knock-knock joke.

09:09.325 --> 09:14.781
And I'll tell you but I don't want to disturb
us with ten minutes of glorious laughter.

09:15.947 --> 09:20.303
Okay and third he has to be interested in women shoes.

09:20.346 --> 09:25.221
- Oh Fez that's like last night when you put on my heels. 
- Anyway.

09:26.115 --> 09:27.981
Ok.

09:33.408 --> 09:37.341
Ok. I'll let you guys hash this out on your own.

09:37.527 --> 09:40.282
Baby some stories are just for us.

09:43.368 --> 09:44.722
Jackie,

09:45.047 --> 09:48.262
have you realized who fits every
single thing on your list ?

09:49.166 --> 09:53.142
Yeah ! Elton John !

09:54.566 --> 09:58.581
And I think he's single because
he's never seen out with a girl !

10:01.485 --> 10:03.363
No, I'm talking about Fez.

10:03.507 --> 10:04.303
What ?

10:04.386 --> 10:09.941
Hey, you wrote the list. And the lists don't lie.
And you ideal man is Fez.

10:11.038 --> 10:17.033
Oh. that is almost as ridiculous as you looking
in the mirror and thinking this outfit works.

10:17.917 --> 10:23.053
Oh, yeah ? At least I can see over the bathroom
counter to look in the mirror.

10:23.807 --> 10:25.801
Oh, hey ! You know what ?

10:25.807 --> 10:31.350
I found the perfect dress for you that will fit you. Oh you
gonna have to borrow it from the Statue of Liberty.

10:32.313 --> 10:35.079
Ok, ok, truth,

10:35.330 --> 10:38.350
I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just stop and call it even.

10:38.554 --> 10:39.918
Ok, fine.

10:41.999 --> 10:45.432
You like Feeez, you like Feez !

10:52.326 --> 10:54.722
Today was a total disaster.

10:55.345 --> 11:00.680
I didn't send one muffler and I drew a dozen
customers into the hands of my competition.

11:01.107 --> 11:03.682
If I were a younger more flexible man,

11:03.925 --> 11:07.320
I'd shoot my foot up at my own ass.

11:09.175 --> 11:10.803
You think you got problems.

11:11.117 --> 11:13.082
I've got a husband-in-law.

11:14.308 --> 11:20.522
Okay, this should cheer the two of you up.
My secret 7-layer casserole.

11:20.566 --> 11:24.940
The secret is layer 3 and 6 are burbon.

11:28.366 --> 11:32.523
I can't gon back on the job market,
it's a young man's game !

11:32.718 --> 11:35.083
Plus I hate everybody.

11:36.145 --> 11:40.070
Well, maybe you should think about retiring.

11:40.476 --> 11:46.510
You're always saying how you'd love more time to drive
around town and yell at men who wear sandals.

11:48.227 --> 11:50.252
I can't afford to retire.

11:51.016 --> 11:55.291
That's it. I'm not waiting for those bastards
to put me out of business.

11:55.475 --> 12:00.392
I'm going to Muffler Master's offices
and give them a piece of my mind.

12:00.938 --> 12:02.792
What if they tell you to take a flying leap ?

12:02.935 --> 12:04.273
Well then...

12:04.378 --> 12:07.032
I'll throw a garbage can through their window.

12:11.406 --> 12:17.221
So, basically, Jackie's list says the perfect man
for her is Fez but she's in massive denial.

12:17.408 --> 12:19.381
Jackie, it's not healthy to be in denial.

12:19.616 --> 12:23.153
Once my uncle came in terms with
his crush on Burt Reynolds

12:23.595 --> 12:25.952
a whole new world opened up for him.

12:26.838 --> 12:31.732
Well, just because Fez matches up a few things on
my list doesn't mean he's the perfect match for me.

12:31.856 --> 12:34.033
We're complete opposites. It's like...

12:34.298 --> 12:37.190
I'm Beauty and he's the Beast.

12:39.327 --> 12:43.381
Uhm Jackie, at the end of the story, Beauty
and the Beast get together.

12:43.767 --> 12:46.762
Oh, would you shut up, you reader.

12:47.406 --> 12:51.340
There are plenty other things on the list.
For instance:

12:51.507 --> 12:56.560
my perfect guy compliments me, buys
me present and comes when I call.

12:56.766 --> 12:59.281
And none of that describes Fez.

12:59.428 --> 13:01.501
Did you call me ?

13:03.386 --> 13:07.280
- What ? No. I...
- Wow, Jackie. You look fantastic today.

13:08.545 --> 13:12.742
Oh, which reminds me, I got you a present.

13:16.028 --> 13:18.622
Enjoy it, bye guys !

13:21.607 --> 13:24.663
Wooow, that was weird !

13:27.386 --> 13:30.002
So you decided what you were gonna do about Sam ?

13:31.776 --> 13:33.670
I don't know, man.

13:33.808 --> 13:39.350
I mean. On one hand, she kept this massive secret
from me and I won't be able to trust her again.

13:39.575 --> 13:45.100
On the other hand, I'm a just a small town burnout.
Who am I to judge ?

13:47.058 --> 13:51.291
Well, All I know is that she makes you happy.

13:51.897 --> 13:55.172
And the only other time I'd seen such
a big smile on your face

13:55.256 --> 14:00.210
was when you got Fez and Kelso to smash their heads
together when you threw a peanut on the floor.

14:03.625 --> 14:05.443
It's a tough decision man,

14:05.787 --> 14:10.202
I'll let the ball decide. If I make the shot, 
I stay with Sam.

14:10.728 --> 14:13.302
If I miss, I say goodbye.

14:20.416 --> 14:22.972
Oh, God's funny.

14:28.347 --> 14:31.750
Kitty, I just got back from the Muffler
Master's offices in Kenosha.

14:31.756 --> 14:37.143
Oh I hate Kenosha, they think they're so much better
than us just because they got a town-pool.

14:37.727 --> 14:43.482
Yeah. Well, I told them, no matter how many
Mom and Pap's stores they put out of business,

14:43.627 --> 14:49.301
they'd better not even think opening a store near mine
or they'll get a fight from me like they've never seen.

14:49.347 --> 14:53.562
- That's my man. What did they say ?
- They're putting a store across the street.

14:54.348 --> 14:55.740
Oh Red, I'm sorry.

14:55.925 --> 15:01.222
Don't be. I scared the heck out of them. They even
offered to give a little money for my shop.

15:01.325 --> 15:02.953
Well I hope you told them to get lost.

15:03.068 --> 15:04.922
Of course I did. Then they offered me more money.

15:04.966 --> 15:06.511
And you told them to stuff it.

15:06.605 --> 15:10.222
- Damn right. Then they offered me a lot of money.
- Go to hell Muffler Master !

15:10.257 --> 15:13.222
Actually, I accepted it.

15:14.975 --> 15:18.503
Thank You Muffler Master !

15:23.605 --> 15:26.541
Oh, oh I can't believe this.

15:27.117 --> 15:28.690
Yeah. Me neither.

15:30.546 --> 15:34.292
But you know I've been thinking about
what you said about retiring.

15:34.467 --> 15:40.272
And I think with this cheque, we can just about
do it. If it's okay with you.

15:41.547 --> 15:42.841
Oh Red.

15:43.965 --> 15:46.812
You don't have to ask my permission for anything.

15:47.317 --> 15:51.600
You have fought in two wars, you
have worked you whole life,

15:51.885 --> 15:54.172
you deserve to cash in.

15:54.828 --> 15:58.482
Well, I couldn't have done it without my best gal !

15:59.468 --> 16:07.823
Well speaking of things you can't do without your
best gal... uhm... how would like to go celebrate.

16:08.138 --> 16:11.762
I was thinking the same thing !

16:18.446 --> 16:20.720
Oh you meant..

16:22.026 --> 16:25.150
well sure, we can get a steak later !

16:30.665 --> 16:34.311
It doesn't bother you that Muffler Master is
going to turn your shop into a parking lot ?

16:34.928 --> 16:39.721
As long as that cheque clears, I don't care if they
turn it into a communist recreation center.

16:44.535 --> 16:46.622
Anyway, what happened between you and Sam ?

16:47.108 --> 16:53.971
Oh well we finally got some time alone, we talked, I
told her it would be a mistake if we stayed together.

16:54.087 --> 16:56.591
She agreed and we hugged.

16:57.208 --> 17:01.011
And she jumped back on the main
stage and finished up her act.

17:02.916 --> 17:05.300
Well, you two kids lasted longer than I expected.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.961
I thought she was going to knock you out,
steal your wallet on the first night.

17:13.318 --> 17:14.292
Hey.

17:14.637 --> 17:17.473
Hey. I thought you'd be half way to Vegas by now.

17:17.728 --> 17:21.280
Hyde, I'm really sorry that things didn't work out.

17:22.146 --> 17:23.440
Yeah, me too.

17:25.925 --> 17:28.922
But I'd like to think that if our paths ever cross again,

17:29.326 --> 17:31.161
I'll be able to give you 20 dollars and

17:31.328 --> 17:33.670
you'll be able to dance for me, that wouldn't be akward.

17:35.016 --> 17:36.853
I'd like that.

17:44.028 --> 17:45.040
Bye.

17:45.326 --> 17:46.753
See ya.

17:49.726 --> 17:50.952
You're alright ?

17:51.896 --> 17:52.832
Yeah.

17:53.777 --> 17:58.460
Let me tell you something son. I dodged
a lot of bullets in Korea.

17:59.246 --> 18:03.370
But not one as crazy and blind as
the one you just side-stepped.

18:05.377 --> 18:11.122
It's weird, man. I never imagined myself divorced from
a Vegas stripper with a second husband at this age.

18:12.095 --> 18:15.070
I never imagined myself retired at this age.

18:16.426 --> 18:20.950
But all I know is, when life finally gives
you a break from the crap storm,

18:21.038 --> 18:22.982
the best thing that you can do

18:23.565 --> 18:26.773
is to crack open a beer with a friend.

18:27.836 --> 18:29.122
To retirement.

18:29.327 --> 18:31.133
To divorce.

18:32.837 --> 18:34.770
You know, Red, time is going to be great.

18:34.917 --> 18:37.871
Sleeping in every day, watching TV,
doing nothing.

18:38.568 --> 18:41.560
I'd be happy to show you how to do.

18:59.775 --> 19:02.153
BEAUTY !

19:02.545 --> 19:05.822
Beast ! I like your haircut.

19:06.388 --> 19:11.163
Oh thank you for noticing. Yeah, I had them taken
off a little extra off the wrists.

19:12.527 --> 19:15.162
So what brings you up to the Forest of No Return ?

19:15.455 --> 19:19.023
See I wrote up this list over who
my perfect match should be,

19:19.235 --> 19:21.402
and... everyone thinks it's you.

19:21.498 --> 19:23.992
I mean, isn't that crazy. You're a beast !

19:24.085 --> 19:26.441
That's true, I'm disgusting.

19:26.725 --> 19:31.193
Yeah ! Oh you... you, actually have
a little piece of elf right here.

19:37.838 --> 19:39.613
Did I get it ?

19:41.116 --> 19:43.780
No, no, here, here come here.

19:47.768 --> 19:49.480
Okay.

19:50.405 --> 19:52.752
Well I'll see you later Beast.

19:57.677 --> 19:58.951
Beast !

19:59.335 --> 20:01.713
You're totally hot.

20:03.927 --> 20:05.981
Holy crap !

20:06.058 --> 20:08.672
I'm going to save a fortune on razors !

20:10.705 --> 20:12.641
Well, you're not a beast at all.

20:13.986 --> 20:15.691
You're a handsome prince.

20:17.287 --> 20:18.670
The list was right.

20:19.668 --> 20:21.412
You are the one for me.

20:21.675 --> 20:24.150
Then come and get the royal treatment baby.

20:34.006 --> 20:36.170
Jackie ! Are you okay ?

20:36.335 --> 20:39.482
You were moaning in your sleep and
while I found it enjoyable,

20:39.605 --> 20:41.592
I thought I should wake you up.

20:42.197 --> 20:48.392
- I'm fine, no I'm fine. It's just that..
- Fez ! Get back in here you beast.

20:48.538 --> 20:51.710
Alright I'm coming my beauty. Grrrrrr.

21:07.365 --> 21:10.600
- Hi honey, how was your day ?
- Oh, great, great.

21:10.795 --> 21:15.812
I scared an entire village and then I tore
down all the trees in the forest.

21:16.488 --> 21:18.303
What's for diner ?

21:18.407 --> 21:20.883
I made you a special dish.

21:21.107 --> 21:23.312
Macaroni and children ?

21:25.826 --> 21:28.802
Italian ! My favorite !

21:29.947 --> 21:34.183
I do smell good ! Hey, save me a piece of me !

21:35.305 --> 21:41.398
