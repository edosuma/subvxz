One! Two! Three!

01:24.110 --> 01:25.487
One

01:25.812 --> 01:27.382
Two

01:27.814 --> 01:32.593
Three, Four, Five!

01:33.119 --> 01:35.020

01:35.021 --> 01:37.797

- He's so sexy.

01:38.357 --> 01:40.959
Nine! Ten!

01:40.960 --> 01:43.941
Before jumping in the pool,
shake your wrists.

01:44.063 --> 01:45.964
Shake right wrists 4 times.

01:45.965 --> 01:48.967
One, two, three, four

01:48.968 --> 01:51.039
Enter now from the last row.

01:52.071 --> 01:53.972
Stop playing around.
You'll get hurt.

01:53.973 --> 01:55.543
Next row.

02:02.782 --> 02:04.455
Attention here!

02:05.618 --> 02:07.652
Attention!

02:07.653 --> 02:11.032
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

02:22.168 --> 02:23.841
What's she doing over there?

02:38.851 --> 02:40.919
<i>One, Two, three, four!</i>

02:40.920 --> 02:44.623
<i>Reverse! Two, three, four!</i>

02:44.624 --> 02:47.503
Roll your neck like this.

02:49.729 --> 02:51.504
Reverse!

02:53.733 --> 02:55.337
<i>What's that?</i>

02:56.569 --> 02:58.446
<i>Why is she doing that?</i>

03:02.875 --> 03:04.376
Come down!

03:04.377 --> 03:05.777
Come down immediately!

03:05.778 --> 03:07.382
Come down now!

03:09.015 --> 03:11.586
<i>Stop playing around!</i>

03:16.422 --> 03:17.722
Oh, my goodness

03:17.723 --> 03:19.066
What's going on with her?

04:05.738 --> 04:07.342
A crazy bitch

04:19.017 --> 04:20.793
U okay?

04:51.651 --> 04:53.426
Honey.

04:55.755 --> 04:57.355
Honey.

04:57.356 --> 04:58.835
Yes!

04:59.058 --> 05:00.358
What are you doing?

05:00.359 --> 05:02.862
I was looking for something.

05:02.995 --> 05:04.872
I can't find them.

05:08.634 --> 05:10.135
Where did it go?

05:10.136 --> 05:12.707
It's gone. Where did it go?

05:13.039 --> 05:14.814
You smoked.

05:15.641 --> 05:17.342
I didn't.

05:17.343 --> 05:21.018
You smell like cigarette.
You liar.

05:21.247 --> 05:23.948
By the way, why didn't you use
a moving and packing service?

05:23.949 --> 05:26.452
Do you know
how expensive it is?

05:32.458 --> 05:37.134
Seo-yeon, where's my uniform
and rugby ball?

05:37.797 --> 05:39.497
Why are you looking for them?

05:39.498 --> 05:42.200
The match starts from next week.

05:42.201 --> 05:44.502
You broke your arms again last year.

05:44.503 --> 05:48.280
I'm embarrassed if you wear a cast
when we have a family gathering.

05:48.407 --> 05:50.114
I just want to watch the match.

05:51.344 --> 05:53.415
Where did they possibly go?

05:56.349 --> 05:57.919
Oh, here they are.

06:01.854 --> 06:05.233
Wow, they are washed and clean.

06:05.358 --> 06:07.192
Smell's so fresh.

06:07.193 --> 06:09.394
- Just watch the game only!
- Without a doubt!

06:09.395 --> 06:12.569
I promise I'll just wear them
and watch the match.

06:19.138 --> 06:21.618
Why a dodge ball all the time?

06:21.741 --> 06:26.044
I draw a line and pass a ball
then they'd play by themselves for an hour.

06:26.045 --> 06:29.925
Let them play something else.
Mothers will make a great fuss.

06:30.349 --> 06:32.625
They played kicked ball before.

06:33.953 --> 06:36.554
How's the new house?
Does Seo-yeon like it?

06:36.555 --> 06:38.056
So so.

06:38.057 --> 06:40.264
Come to visit us some time
when you are free.

06:41.093 --> 06:42.766
Pass me the ball.

07:32.912 --> 07:35.984
Are you okay?

07:39.819 --> 07:43.028
Your fingers might be broken
if you try to catch those balls.

07:43.656 --> 07:47.729
I am not afraid of anything.

07:48.761 --> 07:51.537
When I was your age,
I wasn't afraid of anything, either.

07:54.467 --> 07:58.745
What about now?
What are you afraid of?

07:59.772 --> 08:02.048
Why should I tell you?

08:07.346 --> 08:09.417
So that I can scare you.

08:12.551 --> 08:15.828
Stop playing a joke on me, okay?

08:19.758 --> 08:21.931
Done! You may leave!

08:28.067 --> 08:29.842
Alright

08:35.707 --> 08:37.688
Hello.

08:42.914 --> 08:44.895
Hello.

08:48.921 --> 08:50.696
<i>That's hilarious.</i>

08:52.124 --> 08:53.892
<i>HE BELONGS TO YOUNG-EUN Get
</i> into <i>the classroom, quickly!</i>

08:53.893 --> 08:54.963
Get into the classroom, quickly!

08:57.463 --> 09:01.666
Real-estate or stock...
Not worth of investing these days.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.167
<i>I see.</i>

09:03.168 --> 09:06.980
<i>Have you heard about shale gas?</i>

09:07.106 --> 09:10.508
Dad, I heard that business is
very promising.

09:10.509 --> 09:13.611
- Is that so?
- Yes

09:13.612 --> 09:16.092
I've got some source.
Do you want to join hand?

09:16.615 --> 09:18.116
I can't afford to do it.

09:18.117 --> 09:21.553
I don't have much money
since I bought them an apartment.

09:21.554 --> 09:23.534
Did you finish unpacking?

09:24.356 --> 09:26.427
It was easy, we used
a moving and packing service.

09:27.059 --> 09:28.860
How's the work at school?

09:28.861 --> 09:32.463
- Any difficulty?
- Not really...

09:32.464 --> 09:36.067
He knows that you put him in there,
so he'll take care of it.

09:36.068 --> 09:37.368
Please just enjoy your dinner.

09:37.369 --> 09:38.746
<i>Alright</i>

09:39.071 --> 09:40.641
<i>I'll Pay-</i>

09:42.174 --> 09:42.974
Looks pretty.

09:42.975 --> 09:45.683
My husband bought it for me
from a business trip.

09:45.811 --> 09:49.213
Buy some expensive bags like this too.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.516
Do you know how
important for ladies

09:51.517 --> 09:53.190
to wear expensive ones
as we get older?

09:54.119 --> 09:55.894
<i>Look at you.</i>

09:59.825 --> 10:01.998
One Marlboro Light, please.

10:04.530 --> 10:08.166
Are you here to buy something?

10:08.167 --> 10:10.168
Please buy me
a strawberry milk.

10:10.169 --> 10:12.843
I should eat a lot
to recover from the injury.

10:13.672 --> 10:15.845
I'll pay all together.

10:17.276 --> 10:21.247
By the way, why am I belongs to you?

10:21.447 --> 10:25.088
Three dollars, please.

10:30.656 --> 10:32.135
Want to drink?

10:32.758 --> 10:35.864
No, I'm fine.
It looks like paint.

10:36.695 --> 10:39.767
- I like pink.
- Such a kid.

10:44.903 --> 10:48.006
- I heard you used to be a rugby player?
- Right

10:48.007 --> 10:50.283
I would like to learn too.

10:51.410 --> 10:54.789
Do you want me to hook you up?
There's also a female team...

11:34.353 --> 11:35.853
Nice, nice.

11:35.854 --> 11:37.455
You catch it.

11:37.456 --> 11:39.333
There you go. Nice.

11:53.505 --> 11:55.576
Yes he won!

11:56.508 --> 11:59.410
You're having a dangerous taste
these days.

11:59.411 --> 12:00.411
What?

12:00.412 --> 12:01.913
You know it.

12:01.914 --> 12:06.090
I saw her...
She looked like a doll.

12:06.218 --> 12:07.251
Stop it, dude.

12:07.252 --> 12:08.786
Hook me up with her friends.

12:08.787 --> 12:11.165
Just finish the shower.
You pervert.

12:11.390 --> 12:12.690
I'm not a pervert.

12:12.691 --> 12:13.991
Stop teasing me.

12:13.992 --> 12:15.493
So envy you.

12:15.494 --> 12:17.895
- Thank you.
- You know there's a match next week?

12:17.896 --> 12:19.773
Take care of yourself.

12:45.858 --> 12:47.929
You may kiss me.

12:50.963 --> 12:52.533
Fasten your belt, I meant.

13:19.691 --> 13:21.364
What are you doing?

13:23.195 --> 13:27.166
Marking a boundary.
Don't wash your car.

13:32.704 --> 13:34.405
Close the door.

13:34.406 --> 13:35.783
Get in.

13:36.508 --> 13:37.987
Get in!

13:47.452 --> 13:50.023
Don't make a space.

13:50.355 --> 13:52.456
Close the gap.

13:52.457 --> 13:54.130
Hurry UP-

14:05.404 --> 14:06.906
Hurry up and let's go.

15:11.603 --> 15:14.639
<i>They did quite well,</i>

15:14.640 --> 15:17.041
but <i>I just</i> wonder
how much they can move further.

15:17.042 --> 15:20.344
Let's see how much Yonsei Univ.
can defend.

15:20.345 --> 15:22.747
Yonsei's strategy <i>is</i>
to continue offense

15:22.748 --> 15:26.250
<i>by keeping on its winning streak.</i>

15:26.251 --> 15:29.232
But Korea Univ.
has a strong defense strategy.

15:46.405 --> 15:47.975
Where is it?

15:54.813 --> 15:58.693
Why are you toiling yourself late night?
I'll help you tomorrow.

15:58.984 --> 16:02.158
I'm fine.

16:31.850 --> 16:35.953
- What are you looking for?

16:35.954 --> 16:40.157
- Are you looking for this?
- Yes.

16:40.158 --> 16:43.527
- I look pretty?
- Sure.

16:43.528 --> 16:48.366
- Did you pick it at the school?
- I did.

16:48.367 --> 16:51.871
- I'll wear it.
- As you want.

17:46.825 --> 17:48.395
Honey.

17:48.627 --> 17:50.937
Honey, wait.

17:54.166 --> 17:55.839
Honey.

18:02.507 --> 18:05.283
It seems too deep.

18:51.323 --> 18:52.700
Hello?

18:53.125 --> 18:55.196
Oh, hi.

18:55.327 --> 18:58.195
I called you a couple of times

18:58.196 --> 19:00.176
for the water leaking
from the ceiling...

19:20.485 --> 19:21.886
Mr. Kim!

19:21.887 --> 19:24.561
Why are you still here?

19:25.090 --> 19:29.163
I was going to run out,
but it's raining too much.

19:30.629 --> 19:32.905
I will go back home when the rain stops.

19:38.136 --> 19:39.513
Are you cold?

19:41.072 --> 19:42.449
Yes, I am.

19:59.157 --> 20:01.330
Do you feel better now?

20:02.661 --> 20:04.140
Is it delicious?

20:04.663 --> 20:07.798
I am just drinking it
because I am cold.

20:07.799 --> 20:09.779
You should drink
something else then.

20:11.102 --> 20:13.776
But no strawberry milk
in the vending machine.

20:17.709 --> 20:20.019
Aren't you tired of it?

20:22.747 --> 20:25.626
When I am into one thing,
I only eat that one.

20:26.451 --> 20:29.330
Hurry up drinking.
You'd better get going now.

20:31.189 --> 20:33.465
But it's still raining.

20:40.632 --> 20:42.407
It'll stop soon.

20:45.937 --> 20:49.214
But I'd like to be with you more.

20:54.279 --> 20:57.055
I'll scold you
if you keep acting up.

21:12.964 --> 21:17.879
How do you think about me?

21:32.350 --> 21:34.227
If you are done drinking,
just get up.

21:38.757 --> 21:40.600
I should've drank it slowly.

21:47.832 --> 21:50.210
You might catch a cold
change to this clothes.

21:54.973 --> 21:57.544
Why? Does it smell sweat?

21:59.778 --> 22:01.985
It smells you.

22:03.315 --> 22:05.090
Hurry up and change.

22:12.190 --> 22:13.567
What are you hestating?

22:14.392 --> 22:16.393
Should I enter alone?

22:16.394 --> 22:17.771
Then what?

22:19.698 --> 22:21.177
I'm scared...

22:22.901 --> 22:24.903
You said you aren't afraid of anything.

22:25.637 --> 22:27.617
Did I say I'm afraid?

22:27.839 --> 22:29.512
I told you I am scared.

22:45.623 --> 22:47.193
Don't close the door, please.

22:47.425 --> 22:48.995
I'm scared.

23:11.649 --> 23:13.219
Are you done?

23:14.185 --> 23:16.062
But the zipper doesn't work.

23:16.588 --> 23:18.363
Try again.

23:19.190 --> 23:21.170
It seems broken.

23:22.193 --> 23:26.005
Hook the bottom part well,
then it will work.

23:28.233 --> 23:30.213
It still doesn't work.

23:38.076 --> 23:40.352
Try it again.

23:41.579 --> 23:43.650
I am telling you,
it's not working.

23:46.918 --> 23:48.898
Try your best.

23:54.325 --> 23:56.327
Look!

23:56.661 --> 23:58.834
This zipper really does not work.

24:10.241 --> 24:12.517
Can you please do this for me?

24:51.416 --> 24:53.396
I'll head out now

24:54.719 --> 24:56.494
so you take your time.

25:12.570 --> 25:14.641
Please don't leave me alone.

25:15.340 --> 25:17.149
I'm scared...

26:35.253 --> 26:37.028
Wait for me.

26:40.325 --> 26:41.895
Wait a minute.

27:29.741 --> 27:33.211
Your heart is racing.

27:33.344 --> 27:34.948
Just be quiet.

27:44.155 --> 27:45.930
You're hurting me.

27:52.030 --> 27:53.941
It hurts.

27:54.666 --> 27:56.441
I told you it hurts.

27:56.768 --> 27:58.441
Be quite!

28:22.360 --> 28:24.135
Who's there?

28:27.965 --> 28:29.444
Is somebody there?

28:35.306 --> 28:36.979
Who's that?

28:39.410 --> 28:41.117
Who's that over there?

29:00.131 --> 29:01.701
Young-eun.

29:03.234 --> 29:04.804
Young-eun.

29:05.236 --> 29:06.943
Young-eun.

29:09.640 --> 29:11.347
Young-eun.

29:17.115 --> 29:18.788
Young-eun.

29:22.253 --> 29:23.823
Young-eun.

29:46.144 --> 29:50.718
<i>Everybody': off home.
He must have left...</i>

29:51.249 --> 29:52.694
Wait a minute.

29:53.818 --> 29:55.297
Who's there?

29:57.955 --> 29:59.957
Oh, Mr. Kim.

30:00.224 --> 30:02.101
Haven't you left the school yet?

30:02.260 --> 30:03.933
Yes.

30:06.130 --> 30:07.130
He's here...

30:07.131 --> 30:08.965
Yes.

30:08.966 --> 30:10.343
Honey.

30:12.370 --> 30:13.644
Yeah...

30:24.115 --> 30:26.288
Why didn't you
pick up the phone?

30:27.051 --> 30:29.224
I didn't know you called me.
It was in the bag.

30:33.858 --> 30:35.735
It seems the rain stopped.

30:38.696 --> 30:39.970
Honey.

30:42.200 --> 30:43.577
Honey!

30:44.202 --> 30:45.977
It's stopped.

30:48.739 --> 30:52.312
I left something at school.

30:52.543 --> 30:53.443
Can you go ahead?

30:53.444 --> 30:55.424
I will grab it and go home.

30:56.981 --> 30:58.858
Let's go together, honey.

31:01.686 --> 31:03.256
Well...

31:03.688 --> 31:05.088
I'll just pick it up later.

31:05.089 --> 31:06.693
Let's go.

31:12.563 --> 31:14.164
Honey.

31:14.165 --> 31:17.601
I inquired at the real-estate,
the internet and so on.

31:17.602 --> 31:23.177
They all say the upstair people should pay
for the water leak from the ceiling.

31:25.009 --> 31:26.386
Honey.

31:27.411 --> 31:28.981
Honey.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.585
- Hello, Mr. Kim

33:50.221 --> 33:51.894
- Mr. Kim.

33:53.424 --> 33:54.524
Ju-hee.

33:54.525 --> 33:56.732
Is HA Young-eun absent today?

33:58.062 --> 34:00.864
Hey, have you seen Young-eun?

34:00.865 --> 34:02.037
Nope.

34:51.315 --> 34:52.987
Mr. Kim.

34:57.321 --> 34:59.301
What are you doing over there?

35:05.162 --> 35:06.641
Here you go.

35:07.798 --> 35:09.709
I am relieved.
I was looking for it.

35:12.436 --> 35:14.006
Are you okay?

35:17.441 --> 35:20.854
About what happened yesterday...

35:22.079 --> 35:23.854
I apologize you.

35:27.418 --> 35:29.193
I was scared.

35:30.321 --> 35:32.301
Why did you leave me alone?

35:34.425 --> 35:36.098
I actually came back soon.

35:38.262 --> 35:40.640
I should've waited for longer...

35:42.967 --> 35:44.640
About yesterday...

35:47.805 --> 35:50.081
Have you talked to anyone about it?

35:54.211 --> 35:56.418
How can I tell people
about things like that?

35:58.883 --> 36:00.920
Young-eun,
about yesterday...

36:02.253 --> 36:04.665
Can it be a secret
between you and me?

36:09.126 --> 36:10.901
Two of us?

36:12.029 --> 36:13.508
Yeah, two of us

36:16.267 --> 36:17.837
Two of us...

36:22.573 --> 36:23.984
Mr. Kim!

36:25.209 --> 36:28.383
It is a secret
just between you and me...

36:33.350 --> 36:34.727
The secret is sealed.

36:52.436 --> 36:57.909
<i>The teacher's kiss was
sour and sweet</i>

36:58.909 --> 37:00.820
<i>just like lemonade.</i>

37:14.858 --> 37:19.671
When the thunder struck,
I happened to jump into his bosom.

37:21.198 --> 37:23.833
Just like the time he held me
when I fell into the pool,

37:23.834 --> 37:25.507
<i>I was relieved.</i>

37:52.463 --> 37:58.175
Soon his <i>hands</i> started
groping around my boops.

37:58.802 --> 38:04.582
<i>Then soon they came into my body.</i>

38:08.112 --> 38:15.826
His fingers <i>in</i> my body
were warm and firm.

38:27.398 --> 38:28.877
Be quite.

38:29.099 --> 38:31.170
It says they were warm and firm.

38:32.236 --> 38:33.336
You, what's that?

38:33.337 --> 38:35.438
This is damn funny.

38:35.439 --> 38:36.918
Unbelievable.

38:40.144 --> 38:41.953
It is shocking.

38:42.780 --> 38:44.157
<i>What are they doing?</i>

38:44.481 --> 38:46.119
Aren't they watching a porno?

38:51.922 --> 38:53.299
What's up?

38:53.624 --> 38:54.898
What are you doing?

38:58.829 --> 39:00.331
Step aside

39:14.745 --> 39:16.725
Online diary...

39:17.715 --> 39:19.194
Did you write the diary?

39:20.584 --> 39:21.961
Yes.

39:23.087 --> 39:24.887
Is it all true?

39:24.888 --> 39:26.162
What do you mean?

39:26.690 --> 39:28.897
Mr. Kim, I mean...

39:30.027 --> 39:37.138
Did some teacher do that to you?

39:38.369 --> 39:40.542
What does it mean "doing that to me"?

39:44.074 --> 39:45.382
I mean...

39:48.412 --> 39:51.484
Your body...

39:53.117 --> 39:54.619
He touched it...

39:55.252 --> 39:58.722
Did he really do that to you?

40:13.170 --> 40:14.740
It's only a fiction.

40:18.776 --> 40:21.848
So you just made it up?

40:23.414 --> 40:24.893
Yes.

40:25.716 --> 40:28.390
I am not suspicious of you, Mr. Kim.

40:31.255 --> 40:33.132
But it's just the nature of this school.

40:35.359 --> 40:39.830
Kids grow only <i>in</i> this town
from kindergarten to high school.

40:40.464 --> 40:42.598
<i>So they are quite naive.</i>

40:42.599 --> 40:45.401
<i>Their standard of living is
similar</i> to <i>each</i> other.

40:45.402 --> 40:48.281
<i>There are no cheeky students
in this school.</i>

40:48.505 --> 40:52.141
So their parents keep watching
the school carefully.

40:52.142 --> 40:54.744
<i>Even if you are clean,</i>

40:54.745 --> 40:57.589
the school has to
take an action against you.

40:58.949 --> 41:01.259
<i>You should behave yourself
in</i> every <i>situation from now on.</i>

41:02.186 --> 41:05.861
No more rumors
about you and student.

41:06.590 --> 41:08.194
Aren't you embarrassed?

41:08.459 --> 41:10.059
Don't you know any shame
at your age?

41:10.060 --> 41:11.060
Why are you mad at me?

41:11.061 --> 41:13.563
What on earth
did you write the story?

41:13.564 --> 41:15.441
Why did you write it?

41:17.167 --> 41:19.078
So that I wouldn't forget about it.

41:19.503 --> 41:20.481
It's not even a lie.

41:20.571 --> 41:22.949
I know it's not a lie.
lt'a real story.

41:26.877 --> 41:28.857
Now you are driving me crazy!

41:33.283 --> 41:35.263
You look like a stranger.

41:41.425 --> 41:42.525
<i>Catch the ball.</i>

41:42.526 --> 41:44.096
<i>Go catch!</i>

41:46.263 --> 41:48.464
You should've given the penalty
to that team, but not to us!

41:48.465 --> 41:50.138
Are you blind?

41:52.669 --> 41:54.046
<i>Here!</i>

41:54.805 --> 41:56.284
<i>Catch it.</i>

42:08.185 --> 42:09.886
Jun-gi.

42:09.887 --> 42:11.387
Are you having an affair?

42:11.388 --> 42:12.922
What do you mean?

42:12.923 --> 42:14.698
Who's "Strawberry Milk"?

42:16.293 --> 42:19.137
She texted you 10 times.

42:20.564 --> 42:22.373
It says she's waiting for you
at the rooftop.

42:33.210 --> 42:35.884
Finished already?
Here's more.

42:38.782 --> 42:41.285
By the way,
Hyung-seok quit the job?

42:41.385 --> 42:42.455
He did.

42:42.519 --> 42:44.294
Then there's a coach vacancy,
isn't it?

42:44.454 --> 42:46.656
Why? Do you want the job?

42:46.657 --> 42:50.867
I wanna cut out this teaching job.
Shit!

42:50.961 --> 42:53.262
Nuts to you!

42:53.263 --> 42:56.540
Dude, where can you find a job
like a teacher?

42:56.600 --> 42:59.235
Banks give you a low interest.

42:59.236 --> 43:00.336
And when your children are growing,

43:00.337 --> 43:02.438
do you know
how much they spend money?

43:02.439 --> 43:04.840
And you are going to
have the second baby.

43:04.841 --> 43:07.276
The baby is the first one, you idiot.

43:07.277 --> 43:09.382
You blockhead!

43:09.913 --> 43:12.291
Why is it the first one?

43:12.816 --> 43:15.618
Didn't you get married
because you knocked up your wife?

43:15.619 --> 43:17.219
You quit playing
when you were on a roll,

43:17.220 --> 43:20.224
so the team made fuss about it.

43:20.557 --> 43:22.537
I have a behind story.

43:23.260 --> 43:24.739
None of your business.

43:29.399 --> 43:31.276
Pick up the phone, you bastard.

43:36.373 --> 43:38.512
<i>STRAWBERRY MILK</i>

44:08.205 --> 44:10.481
I set the table for you, so eat.

44:26.757 --> 44:30.136
If the secretary calls,
tell him to look out for a new one.

44:30.794 --> 44:32.774
I'll only work until the end of this month...

44:54.184 --> 44:55.959
This supermarket is too expensive.

44:59.423 --> 45:02.996
Honey, I started a tutoring job.

45:04.161 --> 45:06.402
How can you teach
in that condition?

45:06.797 --> 45:08.367
Any job is helpful for us.

45:08.598 --> 45:11.078
It takes a lot of money
to raise a child.

45:15.972 --> 45:18.953
Honey, are you done shopping?

45:21.511 --> 45:22.785
Let's go to a wholesale instead.

45:23.080 --> 45:24.650
Okay.

45:41.031 --> 45:42.510
Hello.

45:44.167 --> 45:45.942
Hello.

45:47.471 --> 45:48.950
<i>Mr. Kim.</i>

45:52.576 --> 45:54.385
<i>Mr. Kim.</i>

45:56.213 --> 45:57.886
<i>I miss you...</i>

46:36.820 --> 46:39.198
- Hello.
- Hello.

46:42.159 --> 46:45.936
I envy you, Mr. Kim.

46:46.363 --> 46:48.343
You are so popular.

47:14.624 --> 47:16.258
Honey, I am back.

47:16.259 --> 47:17.636
Are you?

47:17.961 --> 47:19.261
You must be hungry.

47:19.262 --> 47:21.664
Yeah, my throat is dry.

47:21.665 --> 47:24.441
I will cook something tasty.

47:27.804 --> 47:29.505
- Wait a second.
- Why?

47:29.506 --> 47:31.507
I want to show you something.

47:31.508 --> 47:33.008
But I am starving.

47:33.009 --> 47:34.710
Just one second.

47:34.711 --> 47:36.213
What is it?

47:36.847 --> 47:38.520
Ta-da!

47:40.150 --> 47:41.629
Hey presto!

47:42.652 --> 47:44.029
So cute, huh?

47:44.588 --> 47:46.363
Seo-yeon, what are all these?

47:47.090 --> 47:50.367
It was possible because of the girl.

47:59.135 --> 48:00.614
Welcome.

48:05.075 --> 48:07.009
I didn't know
she was your student.

48:07.010 --> 48:08.580
This isn't a coincidence
that we met.

48:16.553 --> 48:19.329
I think he's feeling uncomfortable
around me.

48:21.791 --> 48:23.668
No, he isn't.

48:37.207 --> 48:38.880
The soup is tasty.

48:39.009 --> 48:40.818
Do you want some more?

48:40.977 --> 48:42.251
Yes, Mam.

49:04.768 --> 49:07.009
- Thank you.
- Help yourself.

49:10.340 --> 49:12.013
I will sleep over here.

49:14.544 --> 49:16.353
Tell her to sleep over.

49:16.579 --> 49:19.253
She said her parents are out
for ancestral rite.

49:20.684 --> 49:22.459
She will scared left alone at home.

49:24.487 --> 49:25.795
Please?

49:53.650 --> 49:56.221
When we listen to Bach,
you'll have good memory.

49:59.956 --> 50:01.256
Seo-yeon...

50:01.257 --> 50:02.565
Why?

50:03.226 --> 50:04.626
Young-eun...

50:04.627 --> 50:07.506
Yeah, she's so pretty.

50:08.331 --> 50:11.107
I wish I could give a birth
to a daughter like her.

50:13.169 --> 50:14.648
You'd better stop the tutoring.

50:16.973 --> 50:18.247
How come?

50:18.975 --> 50:22.081
Just quit it.
I don't feel comfortable.

50:23.613 --> 50:26.492
But I already received the tuition fee.

50:29.519 --> 50:32.022
Why don't you just return it?

50:33.456 --> 50:36.630
I aleady bought some medicine
for your mother.

50:41.498 --> 50:43.171
Young-eun...

50:45.402 --> 50:47.279
She likes me.

50:56.246 --> 50:58.157
Kids at that age
have a thing on a teacher.

51:47.964 --> 51:49.443
Are you crazy?

51:51.768 --> 51:53.975
Don't do it.
She'll soon wake up.

51:58.508 --> 51:59.885
What are you up to?

52:00.009 --> 52:01.716
Stop playing-

52:02.645 --> 52:04.146
I said stop it.

52:04.147 --> 52:05.717
Is it because I am poor at this?

52:06.049 --> 52:07.460
I will try my best.

52:10.620 --> 52:12.395
Young-eun, Young-eun!

52:15.525 --> 52:18.227
Guys like these things.

52:18.228 --> 52:20.037
Stop it.

52:22.165 --> 52:23.735
Young-eun!

52:27.470 --> 52:28.847
Don't do it!

52:32.709 --> 52:35.883
Honey!

52:57.767 --> 52:59.768
The baby due is coming soon.

52:59.769 --> 53:01.749
Yes, 2 weeks left.

53:01.871 --> 53:04.943
Does your school know
about Young-eun?

53:06.075 --> 53:07.315
Huh?

53:07.644 --> 53:09.244
About the tutoring...

53:09.245 --> 53:11.446
lam worried if he would be
in a trouble.

53:11.447 --> 53:14.223
It's a bit strange that
he wants me to stop teaching.

53:15.151 --> 53:18.257
It woudn't do any good to him.

53:18.788 --> 53:21.166
The principal is also walking on eggshells
around Young-eun?

53:21.391 --> 53:24.497
I heard she is a secret child
of a CEO of a large company.

53:24.894 --> 53:28.931
How do you know about it?
The thing moves very fast.

53:28.932 --> 53:31.606
People here gossip a lot.

53:33.870 --> 53:35.872
Now you know
how to compress the chest.

53:35.972 --> 53:37.246
Yes.

53:37.307 --> 53:39.981
I'll show you a demonstration.

53:40.076 --> 53:41.248
Who wants to volunteer?

53:41.311 --> 53:45.020
Me!

53:49.385 --> 53:51.160
Ju-hee, come out.

53:51.588 --> 53:53.192
<i>What?</i>

53:53.723 --> 53:55.023
<i>What is he doing?</i>

53:55.024 --> 53:56.503
Be quiet, everyone!

53:56.926 --> 53:58.303
Lower your leg a bit and

53:59.128 --> 54:03.634
hold the forehead as I told you,
then hold the chin.

54:03.800 --> 54:05.780
Where did I tell you to look at?
Look at the chest.

54:05.868 --> 54:06.539
Yes.

54:06.603 --> 54:08.412
Look at your bosom at where you are.

54:13.443 --> 54:15.544
Quite down! Be quite!

54:15.545 --> 54:17.045
Ju-hee, go back to your place.

54:17.046 --> 54:18.923
Stop playing during class.

54:20.783 --> 54:22.884
- Did I make myself clear?
- Yes.D500

54:22.885 --> 54:24.558
Then let's practice now.

54:27.590 --> 54:29.825
Was it really good?
You loved it?

54:29.826 --> 54:31.426
Get back to your senses.

54:31.427 --> 54:34.499
How do you feel that
you kissed the PE teacher?

54:34.631 --> 54:36.406
It was my first kiss.

54:36.566 --> 54:39.672
Bullshit! How many times
have you done the first kiss?

54:39.769 --> 54:41.840
So how did you like it?

54:41.904 --> 54:44.680
I don't know.
I don't remember anything.

54:50.413 --> 54:51.892
Who's that?

54:52.682 --> 54:55.060
Who are you?
Don't play with me.

54:59.255 --> 55:00.734
Who is that?

55:08.264 --> 55:09.334
How could this possibly happen?

55:09.499 --> 55:11.775
How in the world did you do
the student management

55:11.868 --> 55:15.839
a student brought a knife
and committed the tedious accident?

55:15.938 --> 55:16.973
What are you going to do
with my daughter?

55:17.073 --> 55:20.179
Look at her face!
What are you going to do, Mr. Kim?

55:25.581 --> 55:27.822
Please understand her
she's just upset.

55:28.017 --> 55:29.690
But they said
it wouldn't leave a scar.

55:30.520 --> 55:33.729
It happened in the female shower.
There's nothing you could do at that time.

55:34.123 --> 55:36.603
School wants to drop
the other shoe quitely.

55:37.126 --> 55:39.197
I should've not called out Ju-hee.

55:40.330 --> 55:42.332
So you think Young-eun did it?

55:47.970 --> 55:49.244
It's not Young-eun.

55:49.706 --> 55:51.413
There is a girl who took
a shower with her.

55:53.376 --> 55:54.616
Did you know about it?

55:55.211 --> 55:56.747
Since from when on earth?

55:57.347 --> 56:00.624
All the stories on the online board...
Are they all real?

56:09.025 --> 56:10.402
Come to your senses.

56:10.493 --> 56:12.700
- Where are we?
- We are at home.

56:12.829 --> 56:14.604
- Home?
- Let's go.

56:14.697 --> 56:19.840
Min-ju, I'm sorry...

56:33.216 --> 56:35.890
- Pick up the phone...
- Hey, what are you touching?

56:37.920 --> 56:39.422
Please come around.

56:39.489 --> 56:41.765
I feel... like to die.
I'm not kidding.

56:48.297 --> 56:50.699
We had an accident at school.

56:50.700 --> 56:52.200
Did you two drink?

56:52.201 --> 56:55.273
No, with teachers at school.

56:55.605 --> 56:57.107
We're almost there.

57:03.146 --> 57:05.057
Why didn't you stop him?

57:05.281 --> 57:07.488
Did you just leave him
get dead drunk?

57:11.921 --> 57:13.298
Lie down.

57:15.258 --> 57:16.635
<i>What are you doing there?</i>

57:17.860 --> 57:19.237
It's already late.

57:20.363 --> 57:22.343
You're right.

57:22.465 --> 57:23.876
I'm off now.

57:37.346 --> 57:38.825
<i>Thank you,</i>

57:39.949 --> 57:41.326
<i>for lying-</i>

57:43.186 --> 57:45.666
There are many people
who saw two of you together.

57:48.891 --> 57:50.802
- Just in case that you misinterpret it.
- I don't misinterpret.

57:51.828 --> 57:55.207
You and my husband are old friends.
That's howl understand.

57:58.334 --> 57:59.938
I agree. I'm sorry.

58:00.269 --> 58:01.839
It's late I'd better be off.

58:04.974 --> 58:06.544
People gossip a lot in this town.

58:07.610 --> 58:08.918
Please be careful.

58:12.248 --> 58:13.420
I'm begging YOU-

58:31.534 --> 58:36.534
When P, H, and P
are well combined,

58:38.040 --> 58:40.247
you'll see more than
2 of linear relations.

58:44.780 --> 58:46.054
Do you like it?

58:46.382 --> 58:47.952
I want to try it on.

58:49.218 --> 58:51.494
But people don't take off
a wedding ring for good.

58:52.421 --> 58:54.401
I saw you taking it off
when you did the laundry.

58:55.525 --> 58:58.233
Alright! Just once.

59:00.863 --> 59:02.843
My fingers seem swollen
that it wouldn't take off.

59:09.338 --> 59:11.113
Take time...Slowly...

59:21.784 --> 59:23.764
I guess you like somebody?

59:24.954 --> 59:26.433
I actually love somebody.

59:27.490 --> 59:29.060
It's not "like"?

59:29.992 --> 59:31.767
How much do you love him?

59:34.830 --> 59:39.301
As much as I can cut my one leg
to give it to him.

59:47.209 --> 59:48.984
Who would like to
receive that?

59:56.118 --> 59:59.099
How much do you love Mr. Kim?

01:00:05.928 --> 01:00:07.202
Let me see...

01:00:07.863 --> 01:00:13.870
Can you cut your
one finger for him?

01:00:21.877 --> 01:00:23.652
Time's up.

01:00:23.879 --> 01:00:25.449
Let's call it a day.

01:00:33.956 --> 01:00:35.435
You may leave.

01:00:36.258 --> 01:00:37.828
I'll leave when
Mr. Kim's back home.

01:00:39.195 --> 01:00:40.996
Why? Do you have something
to talk to him?

01:00:40.997 --> 01:00:42.670
I will tell him.

01:00:45.201 --> 01:00:46.771
It's a secret...

01:00:47.803 --> 01:00:49.111
between him and me.

01:00:52.041 --> 01:00:53.418
Is that so?

01:00:53.843 --> 01:00:55.322
He's here!

01:00:58.981 --> 01:01:00.551
You're home.

01:01:01.784 --> 01:01:05.061
Why are you so late?
I have waited for you so long.

01:01:06.222 --> 01:01:07.633
Hand it to me.

01:01:08.257 --> 01:01:09.827
Honey, I'm home.

01:01:10.259 --> 01:01:11.159
You're back.

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:12.833
I'll change my clothes.

01:02:17.093 --> 01:02:18.663
Dinner's ready, honey.

01:02:18.728 --> 01:02:20.639
You're going to be late.

01:02:52.428 --> 01:02:54.305
The lid wouldn't open.

01:04:07.469 --> 01:04:08.846
Let's stop this.

01:04:10.806 --> 01:04:12.183
Why?

01:04:13.809 --> 01:04:15.880
You are afraid of me
to tell her about us?

01:04:19.548 --> 01:04:22.427
I am not going to,
so don't worry.

01:04:24.253 --> 01:04:27.530
Then your wife wouldn't
let me in your house.

01:04:29.592 --> 01:04:30.969
Young-eun,

01:04:34.396 --> 01:04:36.876
I can't cheat on my wife anymore.

01:04:41.837 --> 01:04:44.113
Then, should I tell her everything?

01:05:22.845 --> 01:05:24.449
Honey, are you sleeping?

01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:26.659
No.

01:05:28.984 --> 01:05:31.157
I'm thinking I might quit school.

01:05:45.467 --> 01:05:46.411
Honey.

01:05:48.137 --> 01:05:49.172
Honey!

01:06:06.488 --> 01:06:08.365
It pays less than school but...

01:06:11.226 --> 01:06:12.705
I found a coaching position.

01:06:14.229 --> 01:06:15.299
Coach?

01:06:16.999 --> 01:06:17.977
Yes.

01:06:21.136 --> 01:06:22.638
Coaching job sounds only nice.

01:06:23.906 --> 01:06:26.887
But isn't it just a part-time job
and you can be fired at any time?

01:06:28.477 --> 01:06:30.388
I'm confident I can do it well.

01:06:31.981 --> 01:06:33.358
Coaching job suits me.

01:06:36.251 --> 01:06:38.288
We are going to be parents soon.

01:06:39.021 --> 01:06:41.831
We cannot afford to live
for the talent of your own.

01:06:42.458 --> 01:06:43.368
Seo-yeOfl.

01:06:47.196 --> 01:06:48.971
This is not about
the matter of my talent.

01:06:52.267 --> 01:06:53.871
Then just bear with
the teaching job.

01:06:54.737 --> 01:06:56.341
For the sake of our baby.

01:07:01.877 --> 01:07:03.447
I have something to tell you.

01:07:11.387 --> 01:07:13.196
You won't be able to handle this.

01:07:13.555 --> 01:07:14.761
It's too late.

01:07:15.090 --> 01:07:17.331
I don't want to listen to something
I can't handle.

01:07:47.423 --> 01:07:49.596
Are you really going to
quit tutoring?

01:07:50.626 --> 01:07:52.401
It's tough that my due date
is coming soon.

01:07:59.301 --> 01:08:01.303
I can take care of a baby well.

01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:03.343
But it's tough for me.

01:08:07.643 --> 01:08:09.179
What's the smell?

01:08:10.612 --> 01:08:11.647
Beef leg bone broth.

01:08:13.882 --> 01:08:15.156
Do you want some?

01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:33.837
Are you okay?

01:08:38.807 --> 01:08:40.582
I am pregnant.

01:08:42.678 --> 01:08:43.383
What?

01:13:29.064 --> 01:13:30.907
I feel like I am
riding on a ride.

01:13:31.967 --> 01:13:33.378
Let's do it one more time.

01:13:34.369 --> 01:13:35.541
Aren't you scared?

01:13:36.638 --> 01:13:37.742
Why am I scared?

01:13:40.442 --> 01:13:42.080
What if I push you?

01:13:43.044 --> 01:13:45.081
Why would you push me?

01:13:57.025 --> 01:13:58.436
Please forgive me.

01:13:59.928 --> 01:14:01.202
Forgive you for what?

01:14:02.864 --> 01:14:04.810
I have a wife.

01:14:08.737 --> 01:14:10.045
I know.

01:14:10.472 --> 01:14:11.974
I will forgive you.

01:14:13.141 --> 01:14:15.018
I'll have a child soon.

01:14:15.844 --> 01:14:17.414
I know that too.

01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:20.089
I will forgive you.

01:14:22.984 --> 01:14:24.258
I love you.

01:14:34.863 --> 01:14:36.274
I adore you.

01:14:47.576 --> 01:14:49.180
What's the matter?

01:14:52.047 --> 01:14:53.890
So is everything going to be okay
only if your wife is not around?

01:15:41.429 --> 01:15:42.772
Mr. Kim.

01:15:46.034 --> 01:15:47.604
Mr. Kim.

01:16:08.056 --> 01:16:09.057
Isn't it pretty?

01:16:09.758 --> 01:16:11.704
I remember those time.

01:16:12.661 --> 01:16:14.766
He shivered his hands so much

01:16:16.064 --> 01:16:18.101
it took him a while
to put the ring on me.

01:16:19.334 --> 01:16:21.211
Perhaps, he didn't want to
put it on you.

01:16:24.773 --> 01:16:25.877
Is that so?

01:16:28.443 --> 01:16:32.220
Anyways, I am wearing this ring
on my finger.

01:16:33.582 --> 01:16:37.553
That looks like hand-cuffs,

01:16:39.521 --> 01:16:41.660
that you won't be able to move at all.

01:16:47.762 --> 01:16:49.799
Maybe he wants the baby
for that reason?

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:03.450
These days, Mr. Kim looks different
from these pictures.

01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:07.389
It seems he needs love.

01:17:08.183 --> 01:17:09.924
You know, married couples
live by more than love itself.

01:17:13.288 --> 01:17:18.101
Marriage is a whole lot different
from romantic feelings.

01:17:19.594 --> 01:17:22.438
I don't need more than love.

01:17:23.098 --> 01:17:26.045
He didn't promise you for anything
and he is not responsible for you.

01:17:27.168 --> 01:17:29.341
Without a ring, not spending any money?

01:17:35.010 --> 01:17:38.287
He would thank to you!
For you were easy to play with.

01:17:44.285 --> 01:17:46.128
You were only a toy to him.

01:17:46.788 --> 01:17:47.766
It's love.

01:17:47.856 --> 01:17:49.130
Do you date at all?

01:17:49.624 --> 01:17:51.626
Does he kiss on you
when he sends you o ff?

01:17:52.027 --> 01:17:53.802
How many times does
he call you a day?

01:17:54.195 --> 01:17:55.868
Doesn't he happen to
pick up your phone?

01:17:56.398 --> 01:17:57.968
He's probably fed up with you.

01:17:58.099 --> 01:18:00.010
- No, he's not.
- Why do you deny?

01:18:00.101 --> 01:18:01.769
It's time to leave him
for he's fed up with you.

01:18:01.770 --> 01:18:03.943
He's only fed up with
these pictures.

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:06.885
Just go away from him!

01:18:25.627 --> 01:18:26.901
How was it.
When you slept with him?

01:18:28.930 --> 01:18:30.068
Did you enjoy?

01:18:38.139 --> 01:18:39.846
Of course.

01:18:47.949 --> 01:18:49.519
How did he touch you?

01:18:55.457 --> 01:18:56.697
Did you feel him?

01:19:13.808 --> 01:19:15.344
Are you really curious?

01:19:20.248 --> 01:19:21.852
How should I start the story...

01:19:28.256 --> 01:19:32.466
I was startled at first.

01:19:34.496 --> 01:19:35.907
It hurt much

01:19:38.867 --> 01:19:43.373
because he grabbed my bosom tight

01:19:45.073 --> 01:19:46.211
like this.

01:19:52.413 --> 01:19:53.585
And then?

01:19:55.917 --> 01:20:01.299
Then slowly

01:20:02.223 --> 01:20:03.600
he moved his hands down.

01:20:06.528 --> 01:20:07.905
Under deep...

01:20:11.032 --> 01:20:15.447
His hands were so warm.

01:20:17.405 --> 01:20:22.514
So when they touch my body,

01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:26.591
my body gets hot.

01:21:31.913 --> 01:21:33.153
Why are you acting like this?

01:21:38.353 --> 01:21:40.094
I took her tranquilizer...

01:21:40.889 --> 01:21:41.924
Why?

01:21:42.490 --> 01:21:43.491
I am in trouble.

01:21:44.325 --> 01:21:45.531
Help me.

01:21:50.365 --> 01:21:51.742
You must be crazy!

01:21:52.834 --> 01:21:54.404
She said she'll give birth
to her child.

01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:58.016
If she delivers the baby,
that'd be the end of his life.

01:21:58.373 --> 01:21:59.681
As well as mine and the baby's life.

01:22:02.677 --> 01:22:03.678
I can't.

01:22:04.946 --> 01:22:06.926
You told me my husband and you
are like soulmates.

01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:10.452
Even so, how can I do that?

01:22:10.685 --> 01:22:12.528
You are saying now
this is against your conscious?

01:22:12.954 --> 01:22:15.730
Is she more important than your husband?
You barely know her.

01:22:17.759 --> 01:22:19.739
Please help my husband, can you?

01:22:19.827 --> 01:22:21.431
Not for the sake of me,
but for the sake of him...

01:22:42.350 --> 01:22:43.454
Did you check the bank account?

01:22:43.518 --> 01:22:44.792
It is wired now.

01:22:45.053 --> 01:22:46.396
Let's get started now.

01:22:50.224 --> 01:22:51.635
Would you please leave us alone?

01:23:32.066 --> 01:23:34.512
I thought she was too young.

01:23:35.136 --> 01:23:37.446
Didn't you do a pregnancy test
before coming?

01:23:38.506 --> 01:23:40.782
She acted like she was pregnant...

01:23:40.842 --> 01:23:44.881
She still has the virginal membrane.

01:23:45.813 --> 01:23:47.759
She didn't have an intercourse
with a man even once.

01:23:50.251 --> 01:23:54.324
But no refund for this imaginary surgery.

01:24:33.828 --> 01:24:35.307
It's fine, my baby.

01:24:36.564 --> 01:24:37.474
It's alright.

01:24:38.533 --> 01:24:41.912
Your mom will show you
only good things.

01:24:42.437 --> 01:24:45.077
I'll make you dream
only good things.

01:24:46.174 --> 01:24:47.482
And..

01:24:54.048 --> 01:24:59.088
Your mom will keep you safe.

01:25:30.284 --> 01:25:37.133
My mom used to listen to classical music
when I was in her belly.

01:25:58.713 --> 01:26:00.351
I had a dream.

01:26:01.048 --> 01:26:03.619
A cold and scary one.

01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:09.560
I wanted to run away,
but I couldn't move at all.

01:26:11.325 --> 01:26:12.463
Drink it.

01:26:12.793 --> 01:26:14.670
It will make your body warm.

01:26:24.005 --> 01:26:25.814
Then after my body gets warm...

01:26:27.408 --> 01:26:28.910
Will I get to fall a sleep again?

01:26:29.944 --> 01:26:31.116
What are you talking about?

01:26:34.015 --> 01:26:35.995
What did you do
after you slept me?

01:26:37.585 --> 01:26:39.189
What did I do...what?

01:26:41.055 --> 01:26:42.659
This is not a dream, is it?

01:26:51.632 --> 01:26:52.975
It's gone.

01:26:55.603 --> 01:26:56.877
It's gone.

01:27:07.748 --> 01:27:09.125
My baby's gone.

01:27:11.085 --> 01:27:12.655
It was only your imagination.

01:27:13.955 --> 01:27:16.026
How do you know?

01:27:19.527 --> 01:27:21.438
How do you know about it?

01:27:22.330 --> 01:27:23.741
Have you cut my stomach?

01:27:24.632 --> 01:27:27.169
You never slept with a man.

01:27:32.607 --> 01:27:34.211
My baby...

01:27:34.709 --> 01:27:36.746
My baby...

01:27:38.446 --> 01:27:39.982
It's not fair.

01:27:40.681 --> 01:27:41.785
Very unfair.

01:27:44.819 --> 01:27:47.095
It would be fair
only when your baby's gone too.

01:27:47.722 --> 01:27:49.022
- I will kill you.
- Don't do this to me.

01:27:49.023 --> 01:27:51.024
- I will kill you.
- Stop it.

01:27:51.025 --> 01:27:52.459
- Let me go, I will kill you.
- No, don't.

01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:54.561
- I will kill you.
- Stop.

01:27:54.562 --> 01:27:56.439
Stop! Let me go!

01:28:02.303 --> 01:28:03.803
<i>Don't do this to me.</i>

01:28:03.804 --> 01:28:05.505
Your pregnancy was
an imaginary one.

01:28:05.506 --> 01:28:07.008
How do you know?

01:28:07.541 --> 01:28:09.342
<i>Seo-yeon!</i>

01:28:09.343 --> 01:28:11.550
<i>Seo-yeon!</i>

01:28:11.679 --> 01:28:13.158
Let me go!

01:28:13.481 --> 01:28:14.755
<i>Seo-yeon!</i>

01:28:15.483 --> 01:28:16.883
Don't do this to me!

01:28:16.884 --> 01:28:18.363
Stop! Let me go!

01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:21.197
Stop it, please.

01:28:21.322 --> 01:28:22.300
Let me go!

01:28:22.623 --> 01:28:24.500
Stop.

01:28:25.926 --> 01:28:28.328
You stop too.
What are you doing?

01:28:28.329 --> 01:28:30.400
Knock it off!

01:28:32.466 --> 01:28:34.639
What's going on?

01:28:35.269 --> 01:28:37.408
You know what your wife did to me?

01:28:37.471 --> 01:28:38.972
She took me to a hospital.

01:28:38.973 --> 01:28:41.174
Don't listen to her!
She's gone crazy!

01:28:41.175 --> 01:28:41.975
Don't listen to her!

01:28:41.976 --> 01:28:43.176
No!

01:28:43.177 --> 01:28:45.378
- Stop!
- You're crazy, really crazy!

01:28:45.379 --> 01:28:47.290
Knock it off.

01:28:49.116 --> 01:28:51.096
What did she say?

01:28:51.819 --> 01:28:53.720
What is she talking about?

01:28:53.721 --> 01:28:55.221
I said she's insane!

01:28:55.222 --> 01:28:56.826
I am not crazy.

01:28:57.458 --> 01:29:00.837
What's going on?

01:29:02.363 --> 01:29:03.863
- What's going on?
- Mr. Kim.

01:29:03.864 --> 01:29:05.275
Seo-yeon.

01:29:06.701 --> 01:29:08.009
Seo-yeon!

01:29:08.235 --> 01:29:09.612
KIM Seo-yeon!

01:29:10.338 --> 01:29:11.715
Are you okay?

01:29:14.909 --> 01:29:15.751
Seo-yeon!

01:29:15.843 --> 01:29:17.151
Hold on a second.

01:29:17.945 --> 01:29:19.083
Your wife...

01:29:20.881 --> 01:29:22.918
killed our baby.

01:29:23.551 --> 01:29:25.622
Our baby's dead now.

01:29:28.155 --> 01:29:30.465
I am not crazy.

01:29:34.362 --> 01:29:36.205
I am not at all!

01:29:37.865 --> 01:29:40.471
Our baby's dead.

01:30:09.530 --> 01:30:10.565
Isn't she adorable?

01:30:11.332 --> 01:30:12.140
She's sleeping.

01:30:22.443 --> 01:30:24.081
- Take a rest.
- Thank you.

01:30:46.801 --> 01:30:48.337
She's really cute.

01:30:49.136 --> 01:30:50.206
Yes she is.

01:30:50.905 --> 01:30:52.009
Is everything okay?

01:30:52.606 --> 01:30:55.485
Yes, she's healthy
though she came out earlier.

01:30:57.378 --> 01:30:58.618
I mean you.

01:31:06.353 --> 01:31:10.426
Can you forgive him...?

01:31:15.996 --> 01:31:17.600
He's my daughter's dad, after all.

01:31:40.421 --> 01:31:41.491
Young-eun!

01:31:48.529 --> 01:31:49.940
What about Mr. Kim's wife?

01:31:51.866 --> 01:31:54.244
Don't worry.
She's fine.

01:31:54.702 --> 01:31:56.181
The baby's also healthy.

01:31:57.771 --> 01:32:00.775
Let's go.
I will take you home.

01:32:07.214 --> 01:32:08.318
Young-eun,

01:32:10.017 --> 01:32:13.464
even if somebody holds you...

01:32:16.857 --> 01:32:17.995
who?

01:32:21.962 --> 01:32:24.533
Anybody, specially men.

01:32:26.166 --> 01:32:29.636
That doesn't always mean
they all love you.

01:32:32.406 --> 01:32:35.319
Even if they don't love you...

01:32:47.021 --> 01:32:49.297
It was a weird dream.

01:32:54.161 --> 01:32:56.107
I went to a hospital.

01:32:58.899 --> 01:33:00.242
So, then?

01:33:02.903 --> 01:33:04.041
Then...

01:33:06.674 --> 01:33:08.654
I saw you in my dream.

01:33:12.513 --> 01:33:14.083
That's a strange dream.

01:33:43.410 --> 01:33:45.083
Can you take that
off my sight?

01:33:56.423 --> 01:33:58.562
I told you I would take you home.

01:34:30.724 --> 01:34:31.634
Why?

01:34:33.961 --> 01:34:35.372
That one.

01:34:47.608 --> 01:34:49.019
I almost forgot bringing it with me.

01:35:12.032 --> 01:35:14.012
Do you just live with me...

01:35:16.170 --> 01:35:17.080
What.

01:35:19.106 --> 01:35:20.847
Do you just live with me
because you feel responsible?

01:35:22.810 --> 01:35:24.221
Why do you say so?

01:35:28.449 --> 01:35:31.828
My dream was to live like today.

01:35:35.022 --> 01:35:37.730
Waking up in the morning,
you are there.

01:35:38.859 --> 01:35:40.964
We eat breakfast together,

01:35:42.062 --> 01:35:44.804
then I wait for you to come back home
in the evening.

01:35:47.201 --> 01:35:49.010
We get to sleep together.

01:35:49.236 --> 01:35:51.512
I bring up children
who looks like you.

01:35:59.546 --> 01:36:00.752
You've had everything
you dreamt about.

01:36:02.349 --> 01:36:03.327
Is that so?

01:36:08.088 --> 01:36:09.897
Then I am supposed
to be happy.

01:36:19.633 --> 01:36:21.544
It will be freezing cold.

01:36:22.870 --> 01:36:24.315
It will be a scary place.

01:36:26.206 --> 01:36:29.187
But you have to bear in there
though it is dark.

01:36:31.712 --> 01:36:33.282
You'll be born again.

01:36:38.619 --> 01:36:40.121
My good baby.

01:36:41.822 --> 01:36:42.800
My baby.

01:37:14.321 --> 01:37:15.664
You might feel cold...

01:37:28.569 --> 01:37:30.139
Our baby...

01:37:31.104 --> 01:37:33.675
How could a baby be gone now?
It was lying on here a minute ago!

01:37:35.843 --> 01:37:37.379
<i>Come quickly.</i>

01:37:38.178 --> 01:37:40.021
The baby is waiting.

01:37:47.287 --> 01:37:48.595
Please calm down little bit.

01:37:48.689 --> 01:37:51.101
How can I calm down
when the baby's gone!

01:37:53.026 --> 01:37:54.164
Seo-yeon.

01:37:55.062 --> 01:37:56.871
Seo-yeon!

01:38:07.608 --> 01:38:08.518
Seo-yeon.

01:38:09.710 --> 01:38:10.654
Seo-yeon.

01:38:13.714 --> 01:38:14.419
Where are you going?

01:38:14.514 --> 01:38:15.492
Let me go!

01:38:16.717 --> 01:38:19.095
Young-eun wants me.
I was told me to come alone.

01:38:19.853 --> 01:38:20.729
Seo-yeon.

01:38:26.627 --> 01:38:27.697
Seo-yeon.

01:39:48.575 --> 01:39:49.781
You're late.

01:39:52.612 --> 01:39:53.556
Where's my baby?

01:39:53.647 --> 01:39:56.753
Today's a tutoring day.

01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:01.028
Tutoring is done.

01:40:03.423 --> 01:40:05.494
But I still have things to learn.

01:40:08.395 --> 01:40:11.342
Then, I will teach you whatever you want.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.344
Just bring my baby back, please?

01:40:16.403 --> 01:40:18.041
You want to hurt me only.

01:40:21.541 --> 01:40:22.986
Where's my baby?

01:40:26.747 --> 01:40:28.624
I don't need you.

01:40:31.351 --> 01:40:33.058
Can you leave now?

01:40:33.487 --> 01:40:38.334
You think you can be happy
only if I am disappeared?

01:40:38.959 --> 01:40:40.597
After all, you will also regret that

01:40:40.827 --> 01:40:42.773
you loved him with all you are.

01:40:44.831 --> 01:40:46.105
Like you?

01:40:48.135 --> 01:40:49.409
I am different.

01:40:53.473 --> 01:40:55.885
Yes, you're different.

01:40:56.543 --> 01:40:58.022
I agree with you.

01:40:58.512 --> 01:41:01.755
So, please...

01:41:02.749 --> 01:41:06.822
Young-eun,
return my baby, please.

01:41:09.122 --> 01:41:10.692
Where's my baby?

01:41:10.891 --> 01:41:11.995
Where's my baby?

01:41:14.795 --> 01:41:16.706
What if it's not too late yet?

01:41:31.778 --> 01:41:33.155
No!

01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:35.253
No! No!

01:42:01.908 --> 01:42:03.512
Where's my baby?

01:42:03.743 --> 01:42:05.120
My baby!

01:42:06.746 --> 01:42:08.157
Oh no!

01:42:09.583 --> 01:42:12.587
You can't do this!

01:42:12.919 --> 01:42:14.220
Where's the baby?

01:42:14.221 --> 01:42:16.895
Open the door!

01:42:17.624 --> 01:42:19.194
Where is the baby?

01:42:31.505 --> 01:42:33.178
Open the door!

01:42:35.208 --> 01:42:37.610
Open the door!

01:42:37.611 --> 01:42:38.988
Open the door!

01:42:40.247 --> 01:42:41.317
Open the door!

01:43:04.070 --> 01:43:05.276
Seo-yeon, I found the baby.

01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:08.979
The babyjust looks like me.

01:43:10.744 --> 01:43:11.779
Where are you now?

01:43:13.146 --> 01:43:14.716
On the top of your head.

01:43:15.882 --> 01:43:16.986
On the rooftop

01:43:18.585 --> 01:43:19.563
Where's Seo-yeon?

01:43:23.056 --> 01:43:25.093
Choose only one person.

01:43:26.193 --> 01:43:28.400
Is it me? Or your wife?

01:43:28.962 --> 01:43:29.838
What?

01:43:52.285 --> 01:43:54.196
I knew you would choose me over her.

01:43:57.624 --> 01:43:59.069
Where's my wife?

01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:01.562
I am here.

01:44:01.728 --> 01:44:05.232
I meant Seo-yeon.
Where's she now?

01:44:05.632 --> 01:44:06.667
Please?

01:44:08.068 --> 01:44:10.014
Where's Seo-yeon?

01:44:19.980 --> 01:44:22.051
I can do better than she can.

01:44:22.882 --> 01:44:23.622
Get out of my way!

01:44:24.050 --> 01:44:25.552
But you love me.

01:44:25.752 --> 01:44:27.493
Please stop doing this
and move away.

01:44:27.854 --> 01:44:29.458
Get out of my way!

01:44:29.923 --> 01:44:31.459
You love me, don't you?

01:44:32.559 --> 01:44:33.663
Move, quickly.

01:44:37.631 --> 01:44:39.008
Seo-yeon!

01:44:39.399 --> 01:44:40.742
Seo-yeon!

01:44:49.509 --> 01:44:50.886
Seo-yeon!

01:44:51.711 --> 01:44:53.712
- Seo-yeon
- Honey.

01:44:53.713 --> 01:44:55.090
Seo-yeon!

01:44:55.215 --> 01:44:56.489
- Seo-yeon
- Honey.

01:44:57.817 --> 01:44:59.922
<i>I am here!</i>

01:45:00.453 --> 01:45:02.330
- Seo-yeon
- Honey.

01:45:03.156 --> 01:45:05.329
Honey, honey, honey.

01:45:05.458 --> 01:45:06.732
Seo-yeon!

01:45:06.926 --> 01:45:09.805
- Our baby's not here.
- Don't worry. She's fine.

01:45:10.330 --> 01:45:11.707
I found the baby.

01:45:13.333 --> 01:45:14.633
You found her?

01:45:14.634 --> 01:45:16.238
You really found the baby?

01:45:17.370 --> 01:45:18.747
Really?

01:45:18.972 --> 01:45:20.451
Are you alright?

01:45:21.474 --> 01:45:24.250
You found the baby...

01:46:11.191 --> 01:46:12.499
Young-eun!

01:46:13.126 --> 01:46:14.696
Young-eun, come down.

01:46:16.830 --> 01:46:18.605
Young-eun, come down.

Did you play with me?

01:47:37.944 --> 01:47:41.721
Did you like I acted cheap?

01:47:45.185 --> 01:47:46.960
Young-eun, it was not like that.

01:47:48.188 --> 01:47:49.462
Come here.

01:47:55.528 --> 01:47:57.804
But your heart was pounding.

01:47:59.732 --> 01:48:01.211

01:48:05.572 --> 01:48:06.983

01:48:07.507 --> 01:48:09.077
Young-eun.

01:48:09.809 --> 01:48:12.312

You love me.

01:48:24.190 --> 01:48:25.567
Don't you?

01:48:39.539 --> 01:48:41.018
Young-eun...

01:48:45.812 --> 01:48:47.189
Young-eun.

01:48:50.950 --> 01:48:52.623
Hold my hands tight.

01:49:01.494 --> 01:49:03.167
Honey, let go of her hands.

01:49:04.664 --> 01:49:06.337

01:49:08.134 --> 01:49:10.410
She'll be obsessed over you.

01:49:15.675 --> 01:49:17.484
She will never let you go.

01:49:17.610 --> 01:49:18.884

01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:22.957
Let go of her hands.

Help me, please.

01:49:32.892 --> 01:49:34.599
Young-eun, please.

01:49:36.563 --> 01:49:41.239
What was it
if it wasn't love?

01:49:48.308 --> 01:49:49.787
Young-eun...

01:49:53.246 --> 01:49:54.725
Then what...

01:49:57.417 --> 01:50:01.593
What are we for?

01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:15.074
Young-eun...

01:50:16.035 --> 01:50:18.015
Young-eun...

01:51:01.814 --> 01:51:04.124
We didn't do anything.

01:51:04.751 --> 01:51:06.526
She fell down alone.

01:51:09.155 --> 01:51:11.658
You were holding her hands
till the end.

01:51:13.292 --> 01:51:15.966
I had no choice...

01:51:16.062 --> 01:51:20.067
But you were holding her really tight.

01:52:16.823 --> 01:52:18.598
Oh my dear.

01:52:19.625 --> 01:52:21.298
What can I do for you?

01:52:21.828 --> 01:52:23.307
I am sorry.

01:52:23.429 --> 01:52:25.263
Please don't cry.

01:52:25.264 --> 01:52:26.965
It's fine.

01:52:26.966 --> 01:52:28.667
It's fine.

01:52:28.668 --> 01:52:30.368
It's alright.

01:52:30.369 --> 01:52:34.249
No worries. It's fine.

01:52:34.874 --> 01:52:36.251

01:52:36.576 --> 01:52:37.953
