[cell door slams]

[cell door slams]

01:19.204 --> 01:20.705
[indistinct chatter over TV]

01:22.832 --> 01:24.209
So this is what you do?

01:24.292 --> 01:27.378
You promise endless shrimp,
then disappear all night?

01:27.462 --> 01:30.882
Leave me sitting around, getting sick
off your fucking nana's endless farts?

01:30.965 --> 01:34.594
Like you ain't got a phone or nothing?
Huh?

01:34.719 --> 01:38.014
Yeah, air that shit out.
Stink like she already dead in the inside.

01:38.097 --> 01:41.518
Then she got the balls to say
I smell like a prostitute.

01:41.601 --> 01:42.560
Ricky.

01:42.644 --> 01:45.480
It's time for fresh air, okay.
You've been cooped up too long.

01:45.563 --> 01:47.106
I'll be right inside.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.573
You're not gonna say nothing?

01:55.657 --> 01:58.827
I sat here not knowing whether
you was dead or fucking somebody.

02:03.164 --> 02:05.291
I knew that company was corrupt.

02:05.917 --> 02:09.254
Do you have any idea what could happen
to me if I got caught with this?

02:09.337 --> 02:11.214
I don't know. That shit ain't mine!

02:11.297 --> 02:13.466
I should have known.
Once a felon, always a felon.

02:15.343 --> 02:17.470
At least someone's
making fucking money here.

02:17.554 --> 02:20.807
'Cause you ain't making shit.
I got kids in the system!

02:20.890 --> 02:24.394
How am I supposed to fit them in this
tiny-ass place? They're fucking big!

02:24.477 --> 02:28.356
Are you seriously still attacking me?
After you used me as a goddamn drug mule?

02:28.439 --> 02:30.859
You're provoking me. I'm provoked.

02:30.942 --> 02:34.988
Stupid-ass me, fallin' for a loser CO
who's afraid to make real money.

02:35.071 --> 02:36.364
I am not a loser.

02:36.447 --> 02:38.449
Oh, no? You a nine-to-five rent-a-cop.

02:38.533 --> 02:41.161
Hanging out with your loser coworkers
like they're your friends,

02:41.244 --> 02:44.164
eating donuts and playing
stupid fucking games all day.

02:44.247 --> 02:48.960
You get paid to sit in a prison.
That's what you want to do with your life?

02:49.043 --> 02:52.297
Until you're 60 and fat
and still broke as shit?

02:52.380 --> 02:56.175
My job has a great retirement package,
okay? And people respect me.

02:56.259 --> 03:02.015
[Nana] Ricky, I plotched again.
I need a new Depends. And bring the wipes.

03:02.098 --> 03:05.977
You heard her.
Go change her shitty diaper, nana's boy.

03:06.978 --> 03:08.688
[Nana] Ricky!

03:10.148 --> 03:12.609
Enjoy the rest of your loser life.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.445
[Nana] Ricky!

03:24.704 --> 03:25.788
[door slams]

03:25.872 --> 03:27.248
[Nana] Ricky!

03:27.332 --> 03:30.043
[Piper panting] Yes! Great hustle, guys.

03:30.919 --> 03:34.672
Great hustle, everybody.
Against the wall for suicides.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.257
Well, this took a dark turn.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.051
It's a sprinting exercise.

03:38.134 --> 03:43.806
You run to the three-point line and back,
half court, back, full court, back.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.016
-[Badison] No, no.
-Let's go.

03:45.099 --> 03:48.603
[panting] Fuck all this running.
Kickball is 90% standing around.

03:48.686 --> 03:50.939
[Piper] Wanna beat D-Block,
we gotta get in better shape.

03:51.022 --> 03:54.192
The sooner we finish this,
the sooner we can start scrimmaging.

03:54.275 --> 03:57.070
Or we can start scrimmaging right now.

03:57.153 --> 04:00.156
Let's go. Three-point line.
Yes, three-point line.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.951
Unbelievable. Chapman was
supposed to be my secret weapon,

04:03.034 --> 04:05.536
but now all she's doing
is distracting people

04:05.620 --> 04:07.747
from their drug addictions
and unemployment.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.708
-I thought that was a good thing.
-Mm.

04:10.792 --> 04:14.754
Yes! All right, nice work, you guys.
Nice job.

04:14.837 --> 04:16.714
Okay! Way to go.

04:17.840 --> 04:19.259
[Suzanne] Um...

04:20.301 --> 04:21.803
She doesn't look so good.

04:22.762 --> 04:23.763
[retches]

04:23.846 --> 04:25.390
-[all exclaim]
-Oh!

04:25.473 --> 04:26.891
[inmates laugh]

04:28.518 --> 04:29.894
[Badison] The fuck you laughin' at?

04:29.978 --> 04:33.523
You never seen anybody hurl before?
I'm injured.

04:33.606 --> 04:34.732
You all right?

04:42.657 --> 04:46.828
We could bury her alive
with a flashlight and shovel,

04:46.911 --> 04:51.207
so she tries to dig her way out
until she reaches the bulletproof mirror

04:51.291 --> 04:52.875
just below the surface

04:52.959 --> 04:59.132
where she is forced to bear witness
to her slow, inevitable death.

05:00.466 --> 05:05.013
Nah. Frieda's a rat. She likes burrowing.
I don't want her to enjoy any part of it.

05:05.096 --> 05:08.099
Jesus! Whatever happened to body hair?

05:08.182 --> 05:09.809
If I wanted shaved legs,
I'd date a woman.

05:09.892 --> 05:11.853
I prefer smooth.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.814
Dmitri has a back like a Yeti.

05:15.398 --> 05:18.234
We could feed her feet first
to an anaconda.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.278
[chuckles] She does hate snakes.

05:20.862 --> 05:25.283
Although I'm craving something
a little more practical.

05:25.366 --> 05:29.495
Practical isn't the game.
The game is fantasy murder.

05:29.579 --> 05:32.874
What if we paid someone in Florida
a large sum of money

05:32.957 --> 05:34.876
to slit her throat with a shiv?

05:34.959 --> 05:36.753
I give it four for creativity.

05:36.836 --> 05:41.049
Four for creativity, sure,
but ten for it's actually happening.

05:41.632 --> 05:44.927
As in... done deal.

05:46.095 --> 05:46.929
[scoffs]

05:47.513 --> 05:48.973
Bullshit.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.099
Bulltrue.

05:50.183 --> 05:53.978
What does it mean, this "bulltrue"?
Is it an American thing?

05:54.062 --> 05:55.188
It's a me thing.

05:55.271 --> 05:59.192
And it means that rat bitch, Frieda,
will be dead by the end of the week.

05:59.275 --> 06:00.735
Enough games.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.697
Now, there's a face worth sitting on.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.032
Huh?

06:06.115 --> 06:07.158
Yeah.

06:08.618 --> 06:09.702
And then she barfed.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.790
Looked kinda like this.
And I said, "Ding, ding, ding.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.793
She must be the killer
Carol sent to kill you,

06:16.876 --> 06:21.631
because she is barfy
because she has nerves."

06:21.714 --> 06:25.051
Like that time I had to keep the secret
of Grace's surprise party.

06:25.134 --> 06:29.806
So then, I threw up in my backpack
every day for a week.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.099
And then on the candles.

06:31.182 --> 06:32.767
[Frieda] Badison's too valuable.

06:32.850 --> 06:36.896
Carol likes to use expendables
to do her dirty work.

06:36.979 --> 06:40.775
I definitely had my detective cap on,
so no one else stood out.

06:40.858 --> 06:44.487
Although, to be honest,
they all seemed like criminals to me.

06:44.570 --> 06:47.406
Could still be someone in here.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.992
Someone crafty.

06:51.035 --> 06:54.372
-Remember those Popsicle sticks we found?
-I found, you stole.

06:54.455 --> 06:57.625
The point is,
a real detective suspects everyone,

06:57.708 --> 07:01.254
especially the ones you'd least suspect.

07:01.337 --> 07:03.589
It might be somebody
right under our noses.

07:04.423 --> 07:08.094
Hey, y'all. Anybody want my pudding?
Been having this lactose issue lately.

07:08.177 --> 07:10.346
-I'll take it.
-No, poison!

07:12.890 --> 07:14.183
You're cleaning that up.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.852
[imitates gun firing]

07:15.935 --> 07:19.105
It was vacuum sealed, Sherlock.

07:20.064 --> 07:21.899
Right. Sorry.

07:23.025 --> 07:25.987
Yeah, there's...
Looks like some got on my shoe.

07:26.070 --> 07:27.864
If you just wanna dab that up.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.658
[Frieda] You wanna be helpful?
Go gather some intel.

07:30.741 --> 07:33.369
Ask leading questions, like they do on TV.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.537
Ah...

07:34.620 --> 07:36.122
I'm gonna take a nap.

07:36.205 --> 07:38.708
Don't you want me to bodyguard you
while you sleep?

07:38.791 --> 07:41.461
Oh. You do your best work in the field.

07:41.544 --> 07:44.338
Now, get to it
before the killer gets away.

07:47.675 --> 07:49.343
Hey, there's a killer?

07:49.427 --> 07:50.470
Oh...

07:51.721 --> 07:53.264
It's a whole thing. It's a girl.

07:56.851 --> 07:59.479
You see that "G" shape?
That is a "G" for "girl."

07:59.562 --> 08:01.939
Plus, you've gotten uglier since we met.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.901
Your little girl
is trying to steal your beauty.

08:04.984 --> 08:08.988
No, you're wrong. The poop's wrong.
I already know it's a boy.

08:09.071 --> 08:10.448
What makes you so sure?

08:10.531 --> 08:12.783
Did you boil a chicken heart
while I wasn't looking?

08:12.867 --> 08:14.827
I gotta go with Miss Cleo on this one.

08:14.911 --> 08:17.663
Your left boob,
noticeably larger than your right boob.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.582
So my money's on a tiny vagina.

08:19.665 --> 08:22.084
Miss Cleo is Caribbean. You are racist.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.461
[Nicky] Okay, my bad.

08:23.544 --> 08:29.008
By the way, I heard some rats squeaking
over by the phone booth.

08:29.091 --> 08:30.510
Might be the kids trying

08:30.593 --> 08:33.513
to <i>Incredible Journey</i> their way
back home to you.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.348
You might wanna go meet 'em halfway.

08:35.431 --> 08:37.350
Nice try.
None of them survived the poison.

08:37.433 --> 08:41.187
They told me in my dreams.
Next time, just ask me to leave.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.899
That was too soon, Nicky.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.153
All right, listen to me, Lorna.

08:49.779 --> 08:54.575
We might be on the wrong side of history
with this whole balls-deep-in-Barb thing.

08:54.659 --> 08:55.743
What do you mean?

08:56.577 --> 09:00.289
All right.
Barb is pulling the trigger on Carol.

09:00.373 --> 09:04.168
She's planning on whacking
her whole posse tomorrow at the salon.

09:04.252 --> 09:08.214
I don't see how waxing her whole pussy
is gonna help kill Carol,

09:08.297 --> 09:13.844
but I am sure that Barb has a great plan,
'cause she is a very smart leader.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.179
She has a very high IQ.

09:15.263 --> 09:17.306
You got corn in your ears or something?

09:17.390 --> 09:22.562
Barb is going
after Carol's whole gang, right?

09:22.645 --> 09:25.982
So Carol and Red
are like the fuckin' Bobbsey Twins now.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.609
If this goes down
the way Barb wants it to,

09:28.693 --> 09:30.611
Red is gonna wind up
with a mouth for a neck.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.530
Maybe she should have thought about that

09:32.613 --> 09:35.992
before she climbed in bed
with that evil, lying bitch, Carol.

09:36.075 --> 09:37.118
Are you being serious?

09:37.201 --> 09:41.872
I mean, I know you love a bandwagon,
but this is Red we're talking about.

09:43.666 --> 09:44.709
Hey!

09:45.459 --> 09:47.545
This is a woman
who protected you for years.

09:47.628 --> 09:50.923
Who made you butter cookies
after Christopher threatened to kill you.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.883
She can't protect me anymore, Nicky.

09:52.967 --> 09:57.263
And Vinnie says it's very important
to have a powerful family to protect you.

09:57.346 --> 09:59.557
Like the Gambinos or the Sopranos.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.809
-Mmm-hmm.
-I have a baby to think about.

10:01.892 --> 10:04.437
You don't understand.
'Cause you is not a mother.

10:04.520 --> 10:08.733
You are right about that.
But you know who is, right? Red.

10:10.192 --> 10:12.361
I don't know, Nicky.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.281
Sometimes, I wonder
whose team you're really on.

10:30.212 --> 10:32.673
Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.

10:33.549 --> 10:37.303
I couldn't pass up the chance to tell you
"Go fuck yourself" in person.

10:37.386 --> 10:40.931
I understand you might harbor
some resentment towards me.

10:41.015 --> 10:45.269
I was hoping that maybe we could try
and move past some of that.

10:45.353 --> 10:47.730
Look, here it comes.

10:47.813 --> 10:50.608
Go fuck yourself.

10:50.691 --> 10:53.778
Wait, Burset. Please?
I'm here to talk about Tasha Jefferson.

10:53.861 --> 10:55.821
Tasha Jefferson?
What she got to do with me?

10:55.905 --> 11:00.201
MCC is trying to put her away for life
for something she didn't do.

11:01.202 --> 11:04.705
And I think that you... can help save her.

11:06.832 --> 11:09.543
You got a minute. Make it count.

11:09.627 --> 11:13.255
I have met with nearly a dozen
other inmates like yourself...

11:14.673 --> 11:18.177
who suffered terrible injustices
at the hands of MCC,

11:18.260 --> 11:21.222
and we're going public
with a series of lawsuits.

11:22.348 --> 11:25.643
Your horrific story of mistreatment
can tip the scales.

11:25.726 --> 11:28.771
We can change the whole narrative
of Jefferson's trial

11:28.854 --> 11:31.148
with the publicity from this.

11:33.484 --> 11:34.485
I see.

11:34.568 --> 11:37.822
You wanna use my story to help her.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.158
Where was this help
when I was askin' for it?

11:41.242 --> 11:44.787
I know I screwed up when it came to you.
I made mistakes.

11:44.870 --> 11:47.415
And that's a big part
of why I'm doing this.

11:47.498 --> 11:52.169
I want to stop MCC from treating people
the way they treated you...

11:53.129 --> 11:55.005
starting with Tasha Jefferson.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.760
You and Taystee, y'all fucking?

11:59.844 --> 12:03.848
What? Oh, no. No, no. God, no. No.

12:03.931 --> 12:07.309
Don't act like that's a dumb question.
She was your secretary.

12:07.393 --> 12:11.063
And everybody know you spend half the day
with your hand down your pants.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.941
All I ask is that you meet
with the lawyer.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.901
She thinks you have a very strong case.

12:15.985 --> 12:20.448
Let her tell you why you're gonna win.
Not for my sake, but for Taystee's.

12:26.245 --> 12:31.292
Is that some Pilates shit?
I ain't never been able to find my core.

12:31.375 --> 12:35.504
I think, instead of a core,
I have more of, like, a soft center.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.547
Hey, T.

12:36.630 --> 12:40.342
I missed you at lunch today.
Your back still bothering you?

12:40.426 --> 12:42.803
It's killing me. I'm broken.

12:42.887 --> 12:43.971
Hey.

12:44.054 --> 12:46.807
Well, you wanna play
Six Degrees of Dr. Dre?

12:46.891 --> 12:48.684
-Oh!
-Get your mind off of it.

12:48.767 --> 12:50.769
We been through every rapper in the game.

12:50.853 --> 12:54.565
We both could use the distraction.
My trial starts tomorrow.

12:55.858 --> 12:58.527
That's tomorrow? Damn.

12:58.611 --> 13:04.283
"Damn" is right, so play with me. Come on!

13:04.366 --> 13:06.494
-Fine.
-Okay.

13:06.577 --> 13:09.663
All right, now,
this one might be a little cray-cray,

13:09.747 --> 13:11.332
but I believe in you.

13:12.333 --> 13:13.709
E-40.

13:15.336 --> 13:17.296
-Stuck.
-[scoffs]

13:18.088 --> 13:19.590
-Cake.
-Okay, what?

13:19.673 --> 13:22.718
E-40 had that garbage single,
"Savage," featuring Jazze Pha.

13:22.801 --> 13:23.636
All right.

13:23.719 --> 13:26.180
Who did a collabo with Snoop
on "Double Tap,"

13:26.263 --> 13:29.391
who was nominated for a Grammy
for his work with Dre.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.809
Okay, you got it.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.853
"Nuthin' But a 'G' Thang"

13:32.937 --> 13:35.231
-That was a little easy.
-Thank you. -You get four points.
-That's like ten--

13:37.691 --> 13:40.694
Jefferson. Is this your cell?

13:41.695 --> 13:43.572
-We was just--
-No, that's a shot.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.200
Now out, before I drag you out.

13:47.576 --> 13:48.452
[sighs]

14:01.048 --> 14:02.299
[sobs]

14:04.343 --> 14:05.469
[exhales deeply]

14:18.399 --> 14:20.109
Can we talk for a second? I got nothing to say to you.

14:24.613 --> 14:28.826
-There's a lot of bad blood between us--
-Then why the fuck are you talking to me?

14:28.909 --> 14:30.953
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.998
A lot of praying, actually.

14:34.081 --> 14:37.918
And I just wanted to tell you
I forgive you.

14:38.002 --> 14:39.712
Yeah? For what?

14:40.713 --> 14:42.506
For getting me ten more years.

14:42.590 --> 14:46.844
You forgive me? After you robbed me
of my one chance to see my son?

14:46.927 --> 14:48.637
Benny could have died.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.806
My daughter's gonna be a teen
by the time I get out.

14:50.890 --> 14:55.811
Didn't seem worried about that when you
was sticking flashlights up guards' asses.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.271
You did that. Not me.

14:57.855 --> 14:59.440
I'm not that person anymore.

14:59.523 --> 15:01.483
You think you're a different person...

15:02.401 --> 15:04.904
'cause you said
a couple of fuckin' prayers?

15:06.947 --> 15:10.618
Let me save you
a lot of time and frustration.

15:10.701 --> 15:13.662
You were fucked up
when God put you in this world,

15:13.746 --> 15:17.499
and you're still gonna be fucked up
when he takes you back out.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.879
Saying some prayers ain't gonna do shit.

15:22.713 --> 15:24.006
So don't bother.

15:27.259 --> 15:32.640
Now, you should step away...
before I do something stupid.

15:43.275 --> 15:44.109
[grunts]

15:44.193 --> 15:47.029
-It's important to stretch after exercise.
-You and Badison playing nice?

15:47.112 --> 15:49.448
She's a little out of shape,
with the recent stabbing

15:49.531 --> 15:54.328
and also... she's out of shape,
but she's got passion.

15:54.411 --> 15:57.623
She's a vindictive psycho,
and you unseated her as kickball queen.

15:57.706 --> 15:59.792
Something tells me
she's not the type to let that go.

15:59.875 --> 16:02.169
Nothing to worry about.
I've got this under control.

16:02.252 --> 16:03.587
Where have I heard that before?

16:03.671 --> 16:07.091
Hmm. I can't remember, so I guess
I'll just have to take your word for it.

16:07.174 --> 16:11.720
Or you could come play with us,
now that you're not handicapped anymore.

16:11.804 --> 16:16.225
"Handicapped"? That's ableist.
Anyway, I'm preoccupied.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.977
-Mmm. I can see that.
-Yeah.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.354
Hmm.

16:22.064 --> 16:25.567
"Apply now
and earn your business degree online

16:25.651 --> 16:27.152
in your spare time." I was curious.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.156
I thought I could become a CFO
by the time I'm out

16:31.240 --> 16:34.952
in four long, long, long years from now,

16:35.035 --> 16:37.121
when I'm further down
the other side of the hill.

16:37.204 --> 16:40.916
You will always be peaking in my eyes.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.210
That's like your mother
telling you you're beautiful.

16:43.293 --> 16:44.336
It's nice and all, but...

16:44.420 --> 16:49.425
At least you're thinking about our future,
when we are both out of prison

16:49.508 --> 16:52.094
and we can wear pretty bras again.

16:52.177 --> 16:55.014
I love it when you talk
about sexy support garments.

16:56.348 --> 16:59.810
This fucking application
is giving me the stress sweats.

16:59.893 --> 17:02.354
Is this shampoo or hooch? Can I use it?

17:02.438 --> 17:05.774
It's for blondes, but desperate times...

17:12.197 --> 17:14.283
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing.

17:14.366 --> 17:15.409
Combing my hair?

17:15.492 --> 17:18.912
You like to come off all sweet
with your big words

17:18.996 --> 17:21.248
and your natural-lookin' blonde hair,

17:21.331 --> 17:23.959
but I dealt with fake bitches
like you before.

17:24.043 --> 17:28.714
You may have gotten over on me with this
kickball bullshit, but I got plans, too.

17:28.797 --> 17:32.593
This is just kickball.
The only hustle here is around the bases.

17:32.676 --> 17:36.388
Do I look like a fucking idiot?
Let me explain how this works.

17:36.472 --> 17:39.683
The C-Block bitches belong to me,
and that's not gonna change

17:39.767 --> 17:43.062
because a couple of retards
wanna call you captain.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.898
So slow your roll before you get hurt.

17:45.981 --> 17:50.402
Look, Madison, you don't know me very
well, so let me enlighten you a little.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.613
I've done the behind the back thing,

17:52.696 --> 17:55.824
the secret power grab thing,
the gang thing.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.284
I have done it all.

17:57.367 --> 18:02.039
This? This is just kickball.

18:03.248 --> 18:08.504
It's one small fucking thing that I can do
to make this place a little bit nicer

18:08.587 --> 18:10.005
before I'm out in a few months.

18:10.089 --> 18:14.760
So is it really so much to ask,
that for this small amount of time

18:14.843 --> 18:19.973
that we have to be together, we get along,
before you never have to see me again?

18:23.018 --> 18:25.854
-A few months, huh?
-Mmm.

18:25.938 --> 18:29.900
Well. Interesting. A lot can happen
between now and a few months.

18:30.484 --> 18:31.443
[chuckles]

18:31.527 --> 18:34.154
Maybe a guard finds drugs
planted in your shoe.

18:34.238 --> 18:39.076
Or you're forced to defend yourself
and you end up in solitary.

18:39.159 --> 18:41.620
Or maybe you wake up
with a bloody shiv in your hand

18:41.703 --> 18:46.083
next to a dead body...
and there's cheese up your nose.

18:48.168 --> 18:51.463
The possibilities are endless, really.

18:52.381 --> 18:56.802
So if I were you,
I wouldn't go send any postcards just yet.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.558
[Piper yelps]

19:03.600 --> 19:06.770
[chuckles] See you at practice, captain.

19:07.396 --> 19:08.856
[laughs]

19:11.525 --> 19:18.323
So, when you were escaped out of prison,
were you ever hired to murder anyone?

19:18.407 --> 19:23.620
What? No. We were just having fun,
all right? Until it wasn't fun anymore.

19:24.246 --> 19:28.458
You know how everybody has, like,
a dark side and a light side?

19:28.542 --> 19:32.087
When it was light, it was cool.
But when he would get dark,

19:32.171 --> 19:34.464
I never knew
how long the nighttime would last.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.842
At least in here, there's a schedule.

19:36.925 --> 19:39.761
That's how I knew I had to come back
and finish my time.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.096
And also kill Frieda.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.433
Jesus, no!
For the last time, I'm not the killer.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.852
Don't you know
the first suspect is too obvious?

19:46.935 --> 19:48.353
Don't you watch any cop shows?

19:48.437 --> 19:51.565
I did, but then I started
getting these nightmares

19:51.648 --> 19:53.233
and I wasn't allowed to anymore.

19:53.317 --> 19:58.405
Oh! Except for <i>Inspector Gadget,</i>
but he dressed a little bit like this guy

19:58.488 --> 20:01.950
who pulled his pee-pee out at me
at the book fair, and...

20:02.618 --> 20:04.453
couldn't get into it after that.

20:04.536 --> 20:08.582
Yeah, well, what you want to do is,
as a detective,

20:08.665 --> 20:11.043
you wanna find your special gift, right?

20:11.126 --> 20:16.673
Like, are you OCD? Are you psychic?
Are you good with human remains?

20:16.757 --> 20:18.258
Ah! You mean poop.

20:18.342 --> 20:21.094
No, I was thinking bones.
But, come on, what are you good at?

20:21.178 --> 20:22.596
Asking people a lot of questions.

20:22.679 --> 20:24.848
-Is that helpful?
-Yes. It's actually perfect.

20:24.932 --> 20:28.227
Why don't you go around
and ask people lots of questions,

20:28.310 --> 20:31.313
say "perp" a lot, and eventually
you'll find out who the killer is.

20:31.897 --> 20:34.107
I'm gonna need a sidekick too, right?

20:34.191 --> 20:38.278
So I can tell them what I'm thinking
for the audience to hear?

20:40.906 --> 20:42.157
Hell, why not?

20:45.077 --> 20:49.790
Is this gonna take long?
I got an overactive bladder.

20:49.873 --> 20:50.999
[exhales sharply]

20:52.417 --> 20:53.669
Just a few more minutes.

20:53.752 --> 20:57.422
Would you describe yourself
as someone crafty?

20:58.090 --> 21:02.636
Well, I once made a sex toy
out of a Pringles can,

21:02.719 --> 21:04.680
but the girth became an issue.

21:04.763 --> 21:08.141
How long approximately would you say
you've lived in this prison?

21:08.225 --> 21:10.686
Approximately, a long-ass time.

21:10.769 --> 21:13.939
-Would you say you never forget a face?
-Depends on the face.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.943
[sighs and clicks tongue] She died.

21:20.362 --> 21:22.948
So I've been patient with you
because I'm a nice person,

21:23.031 --> 21:26.910
but my friend here, she ain't so nice.

21:27.494 --> 21:29.746
No telling what she'll do
if she loses her temper.

21:29.830 --> 21:34.459
So why don't you answer my questions
before she starts asking hers?

21:34.543 --> 21:37.879
I'm sorry, dear. Did you say something?

21:45.637 --> 21:49.474
"Dear Asking for Our Friends,
I'm worried that I might be basic.

21:49.558 --> 21:51.435
I've always loved a seasonal latte.

21:51.518 --> 21:56.189
I've made life decisions based on
inspirational quotes from the Internet,

21:56.273 --> 21:59.234
and the movie<i> The Sweetest Thing</i>
is literally my life.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.278
Does that mean I'm basic?"

22:01.361 --> 22:05.824
Hmm. That seems like a tough one.
I think you should take this one, Tova.

22:05.907 --> 22:08.702
Basic seems like your area of expertise.

22:08.785 --> 22:12.914
Sure thing, Flaca.
It's actually really simple, folks.

22:12.998 --> 22:16.168
If you spend all day
worrying about your makeup,

22:16.251 --> 22:19.171
even though you're locked up in a prison,
you're basic.

22:19.254 --> 22:24.676
If you secretly love Taylor Swift
and think that everyone is so mean to her?

22:24.760 --> 22:26.053
Basic.

22:26.136 --> 22:29.389
And if you write into radio shows
to try and find out

22:29.473 --> 22:32.225
whether or not you might be basic?

22:32.309 --> 22:34.478
Sorry, boo, ya basic.

22:35.312 --> 22:38.231
Well, you heard it
from the expert herself.

22:38.315 --> 22:40.942
The verdict is basic. [chuckles]

22:41.026 --> 22:45.489
Have a think about your choices
and we'll be back with more after this.

22:45.572 --> 22:46.656
Stay tuned.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.576
-[music playing faintly]
-[Black Cindy] Oh!

22:50.202 --> 22:54.081
Good choice. Love me a throwback.

22:54.164 --> 22:54.998
[chuckles]

22:55.082 --> 22:55.957
[gasps]

22:56.041 --> 22:57.125
[groans in pain]

22:59.169 --> 23:00.504
Is it really that bad?

23:00.587 --> 23:02.047
You have no idea.

23:02.130 --> 23:03.882
[Flaca] Back pain isn't about your back.

23:03.965 --> 23:06.051
Dr. Sarno says nothing like physical pain

23:06.134 --> 23:08.261
to distract you
from your emotional fucked-upness.

23:08.345 --> 23:09.513
Dr. Sarno?

23:09.596 --> 23:12.057
Did you get that from a YouTube video
or something?

23:12.140 --> 23:13.642
-I read it in <i>O Magazine.</i>
<i>-</i>Yeah.

23:13.725 --> 23:18.063
The only way to fix it is to figure out
what you did wrong and make it right.

23:23.985 --> 23:25.362
Hey, Hopper.

23:26.988 --> 23:28.031
Rough night?

23:28.115 --> 23:31.076
Your ex-con girlfriend keep you awake
with an all-night fuckathon?

23:31.827 --> 23:34.287
-That is none of your business.
-[Luschek] Sounds like a no.

23:34.371 --> 23:36.331
It's nothing a donut can't fix.

23:36.415 --> 23:39.376
-[Hopper] I'm not in the mood.
-What? Donut Day is your favorite day.

23:39.459 --> 23:42.087
I said I'm not in the mood.
What is all this anyway?

23:42.170 --> 23:44.089
Alvarez's ten-year anniversary at Max.

23:44.172 --> 23:48.343
Technically, it was over the weekend
if you factor in the leap years, but...

23:48.426 --> 23:51.555
Ten years, that's a long time.
Congratulations, buddy.

23:51.638 --> 23:52.472
[Alvarez] Thanks.

23:52.556 --> 23:56.434
Actually, now that you're here,
I wanted to wait for Ginger too,

23:56.518 --> 24:00.438
but I'm worried if I don't say this now,
that I'll never say it.

24:01.314 --> 24:04.693
"These past ten years have been
the best ten years of my life.

24:04.776 --> 24:07.404
There's some work places
that can be boring,

24:07.487 --> 24:11.575
but working here is always exciting
with the pranks, the inside jokes,

24:11.658 --> 24:14.244
the running bets
and, of course, Donut Fridays.

24:14.327 --> 24:18.373
I can't imagine a better way to have spent
the last ten years of my life

24:18.456 --> 24:21.877
than being in this prison every day
with such incredible friends,

24:21.960 --> 24:26.631
and I hope that I have at least ten more
years at 'Lynchfield' in my future.

24:26.715 --> 24:27.716
Thank you."

24:30.886 --> 24:36.099
Tough act to follow.
Better start writing, Hopper. You're next.

24:36.183 --> 24:39.561
What? No. No, your counting's off.
No way it's been ten years already.

24:39.644 --> 24:40.478
It has, actually.

24:40.562 --> 24:46.735
I remember because I was here six months
before I met you and made my first friend.

24:47.527 --> 24:50.822
Coworker. I'm your coworker, Al.

24:52.407 --> 24:53.241
Hmm.

25:01.082 --> 25:04.336
Well, this party makes me
want to kill myself.

25:06.755 --> 25:10.884
Oh, speaking of, I caught inmate Sagher
trying to tie her sheets into a noose.

25:10.967 --> 25:15.138
So if all goes well, there might be
some changes to the scoreboard.

25:15.222 --> 25:17.140
-Know what I mean?
-[Blake] Listen to yourself.

25:17.224 --> 25:20.185
This is a living, breathing human being
we're talking about.

25:20.268 --> 25:21.770
Not for long, though.

25:24.689 --> 25:25.524
[Luschek] Mmm!

25:28.109 --> 25:30.654
Fuck it. I'm done with this game.

25:30.737 --> 25:31.947
Count me out.

25:32.656 --> 25:35.325
[Luschek chuckles] Ooh.

25:35.408 --> 25:38.536
Guess we'll have to divvy up his players.
Silver lining.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.538
We should wait for Ginger.

25:40.622 --> 25:43.083
Why? She's too far behind to catch up.

25:43.166 --> 25:44.876
Save her a donut. She'll be happy.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.420
[Alvarez] Hopper?
You wanna weigh in on this?

25:48.630 --> 25:49.631
Whatever.

25:51.925 --> 25:53.218
[Barbara] Do you hear me?

25:53.301 --> 25:57.138
Hey. Too late
for a fourth-quarter substitution?

25:57.222 --> 25:59.724
Nicky, I thought you didn't approve
of my plan.

25:59.808 --> 26:05.981
I don't. You know, I think it's risky, uh,
and there are too many variables,

26:06.064 --> 26:09.734
which is why you're gonna need at least
one sober person with a brain

26:09.818 --> 26:11.569
to make sure that things run smoothly.

26:11.653 --> 26:16.241
Not that the rest of you don't seem like,
you know, very intelligent people.

26:18.535 --> 26:20.745
-I like where your head's at.
-Yeah.

26:20.829 --> 26:25.333
And that smart mouth might come in handy
if the guards start asking questions.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.837
So after our CO
radios the guard in the hall,

26:28.920 --> 26:32.173
you're only gonna have a few seconds
to make your move. Okay?

26:32.257 --> 26:34.634
Hutton, I need you
to cause enough commotion

26:34.718 --> 26:38.680
to draw the ginger guard out
and then the rest is up to you three.

26:38.763 --> 26:40.849
You're gonna be legends after today.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.811
No one leaves that room alive.

26:55.405 --> 26:59.326
[Red] You get rubbed and I get gray.
Where's the justice?

27:00.660 --> 27:01.828
[Carol chuckles]

27:11.254 --> 27:12.339
[snores]

27:16.843 --> 27:18.053
[clears throat]

27:18.970 --> 27:20.138
[hairdryer whirs]

27:23.516 --> 27:24.601
Allergies.

27:25.935 --> 27:26.853
[sighs]

27:27.812 --> 27:28.855
[coughs]

27:29.606 --> 27:30.440
[Nicky clears throat]

27:59.219 --> 28:01.471
Hey, Young. Get over here.

28:10.230 --> 28:13.775
[man over radio] <i>Young, can you meet me</i>
<i>outside D-Block? I got a situation.</i>

28:13.858 --> 28:16.694
You gotta call somebody else.
We may have a situation here.

28:16.778 --> 28:18.113
[man over radio] <i>Yeah, but--</i>

28:19.114 --> 28:20.156
[Young] That can't be good.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.241
It could be fake.

28:22.909 --> 28:24.536
Maybe we should see how it plays out. Why? You tryin' to get stabbed?

28:26.329 --> 28:30.125
Protocol says she goes straight to
protective Ad Seg till we figure it out.

28:30.792 --> 28:31.668
I'll take her.

28:32.627 --> 28:33.545
Copy.

28:33.628 --> 28:36.965
Inmate Denning, your salon time is up.
Come with me.

28:37.048 --> 28:38.258
Come with you where?

28:38.341 --> 28:40.593
Where I take you. Let's go.

29:05.326 --> 29:08.079
[woman over speakers] <i>Who's a good girl?</i>
<i>Hey, Ruthie, you want a treat?</i>

29:08.163 --> 29:09.831
<i>Who's Momma's good girl?</i>

29:09.914 --> 29:12.250
<i>Ruthie! Mommy loves you.</i>

29:12.333 --> 29:13.960
<i>Hey, Ruthie! Ruth!</i>

29:17.005 --> 29:20.717
Excuse me. Why is Joseph Caputo's name
on the inmate visitation list?

29:20.800 --> 29:21.926
Hmm...

29:22.010 --> 29:25.555
Probably because he wrote it there
before visiting an inmate.

29:25.638 --> 29:27.098
And why would he visit inmates?

29:27.182 --> 29:29.684
I'm not sure,
but he has been here all day.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.853
Apparently, he's a real player.

29:33.396 --> 29:34.814
Did you hear he's dating the warden?

29:36.441 --> 29:37.442
You...

29:40.403 --> 29:43.531
[Suzanne] Yeah, I'm starting to think
it might be a guard.

29:43.615 --> 29:47.535
All the inmates we interviewed
had pretty solid alibis.

29:47.619 --> 29:51.331
[chuckles] That's impressive, considering
the murder hasn't happened yet.

29:51.414 --> 29:54.459
True. Maybe we should start
looking at a motive.

29:54.542 --> 29:59.130
Look, this has been illuminating, really,

29:59.214 --> 30:01.674
but maybe you two should give it a rest.

30:01.758 --> 30:04.427
[sighs] Yeah. I mean, I'm at a loss.

30:04.511 --> 30:07.639
The confused one, she didn't even know
we were in a prison.

30:07.722 --> 30:10.767
And the rich one, she couldn't even
identify Frieda's face.

30:10.850 --> 30:13.561
Yeah, but you drew a Popsicle with hair.

30:13.645 --> 30:16.523
Yeah, wait a second. The rich one?

30:16.606 --> 30:19.317
[Pennsatucky] There's a rich one
who's rolling in commissary.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.403
She's got, like, four radios.
That's basically surround sound.

30:22.487 --> 30:25.907
And she's been eating black Doritos.
That's caviar flavored.

30:27.992 --> 30:30.620
-Mind pointing her out to me?
-[Pennsatucky] Yeah.

30:41.673 --> 30:45.343
Getting ready to take the ladies
to prayer group. Aren't you coming?

30:45.426 --> 30:47.345
Nah, I don't think so.

30:47.428 --> 30:48.263
But you always go.

30:48.346 --> 30:50.640
It's hard to talk to God
when all you can think about

30:50.723 --> 30:52.892
-is strangling some evil bitch.
-Yeah.

30:52.976 --> 30:55.353
Probably not the kind of thing
you tell a CO.

30:56.187 --> 31:00.066
You know, I've been trying real hard
to do the right thing, you know?

31:00.149 --> 31:02.527
Let Jesus take the wheel or whatever.

31:02.610 --> 31:04.279
But I'm starting to think...

31:06.072 --> 31:07.490
she's right.

31:08.241 --> 31:11.369
And maybe, no matter what I do,
I'll still be a piece of shit.

31:14.080 --> 31:17.917
You know, one time when I was a kid,
I almost killed a bird.

31:18.918 --> 31:21.170
Threw a rock at it and broke its wing.

31:21.254 --> 31:24.507
Mormon kids don't have
too many outlets for their anger.

31:25.258 --> 31:29.137
Anyway, I decided in that moment
that I was a piece of shit.

31:29.220 --> 31:32.181
I mean, I had basically killed it
for no reason.

31:33.391 --> 31:37.103
But then my mom made me take it in
and nurse it back to health,

31:37.186 --> 31:40.315
and, a few weeks later,
it healed and we let it go.

31:40.398 --> 31:43.443
And I realized that I had saved its life.

31:43.526 --> 31:46.195
Saved its life?
But you're the reason why it almost died.

31:46.279 --> 31:47.280
That's the point.

31:47.363 --> 31:51.117
When I hurt it, I was a piece of shit.
But when I was healing it, I wasn't.

31:53.661 --> 31:55.371
I don't get it.

31:55.455 --> 31:58.791
God doesn't make good people
or bad people. That's a myth.

31:58.875 --> 32:00.960
He just makes people.

32:01.044 --> 32:04.339
Sometimes they do good things,
sometimes not so good.

32:04.422 --> 32:07.842
But the beauty is you get to wake up
and choose every day.

32:07.926 --> 32:12.096
As long as you're choosing
to do the good things, then you're good.

32:14.641 --> 32:17.185
What, are you some kind of preacher
or some shit?

32:17.268 --> 32:19.354
Yeah, we all are, sort of.

32:19.437 --> 32:20.855
Missionary work.

32:22.106 --> 32:24.901
Anyway, you're not wearing your ID badge.
That's a shot.

32:51.135 --> 32:52.261
Clear.

32:53.763 --> 32:55.723
[McCullough] Hands against
the wall. Hands.

33:06.776 --> 33:08.319
Clear.

33:16.494 --> 33:18.162
Fucking Badison.

33:18.871 --> 33:20.289
It ain't that bad.

33:20.373 --> 33:24.043
I mean, you could shave one side
since you gay.

33:24.127 --> 33:26.921
You know, that's, like,
the look for your people.

33:27.714 --> 33:29.298
What is it about me?

33:29.382 --> 33:34.012
Well, for starters, you don't wear makeup
and I've seen you get engaged to a woman--

33:34.095 --> 33:39.684
No, no. What is it about me
that makes people want to fuck with me?

33:40.977 --> 33:43.521
-Can I be real with you?
-Please.

33:46.691 --> 33:49.694
[sighs] It's 'cause what they see
when they look at you.

33:50.445 --> 33:52.405
They don't see you.

33:52.488 --> 33:55.700
They see the shit they never had.

33:55.783 --> 33:58.369
Money, education, opportunity.

33:58.453 --> 34:03.166
That's why they never gonna stop fuckin'
with you, because of what you represent.

34:03.249 --> 34:05.835
But at least that's only in here.

34:05.918 --> 34:10.506
People out there been fuckin' with me
my entire fucking life.

34:10.590 --> 34:15.511
They see dangerous, poor,
ghetto black girl

34:15.595 --> 34:18.014
that should be locked up in here forever.

34:19.223 --> 34:20.767
[clicks tongue and sighs]

34:20.850 --> 34:25.396
So, like, if you want to trade places,
I'm game.

34:31.569 --> 34:33.196
How do you deal with it?

34:34.363 --> 34:35.948
I try to survive.

34:37.116 --> 34:39.285
[Hellman] All right, Jefferson. Time's up.

34:43.706 --> 34:45.917
So, what are we doing about this gum?

34:51.464 --> 34:52.548
Cut it off.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.594
Remember to sit up straight
with your arms at your sides,

34:56.677 --> 35:00.223
and if the judge asks you a question,
address him as "Your Honor."

35:00.306 --> 35:04.936
Also, during your testimony, you should
refrain from the use of any slang words

35:05.019 --> 35:11.067
like "yo" or "homie" or "homie-dawg"
or "trippin'," "turnt" or "clapback"--

35:11.150 --> 35:12.735
No slang. Got it, thanks.

35:12.819 --> 35:15.613
Okay. And most importantly,
during your testimony,

35:15.696 --> 35:18.658
you wanna make sure to establish
eye contact with the jury.

35:18.741 --> 35:23.287
Do not look at anyone in the gallery.
And especially not at Ms. Jefferson.

35:23.371 --> 35:25.706
Remember the truth is on your side.

35:25.790 --> 35:28.584
All you have to do is tell your story
to the court the way you told me.

35:28.668 --> 35:30.086
But it's bullshit.

35:31.462 --> 35:32.463
What is?

35:40.138 --> 35:41.430
All of it.

35:41.514 --> 35:42.765
[sobs]

35:42.849 --> 35:45.393
Like I said,
I understand you may be frustrated--

35:45.476 --> 35:47.687
No. Mm-mm.

35:47.770 --> 35:49.438
You don't understand.

35:51.440 --> 35:56.237
We was down there with him.
With Piscatella. Alive.

35:58.322 --> 36:02.243
Taystee had the gun pointed at his head,
but she didn't shoot him.

36:03.411 --> 36:06.122
She gave me the gun,
and then we let him go.

36:06.205 --> 36:08.416
When CERT stormed, Suzanne and I hid--

36:08.499 --> 36:11.002
I understand you might be
very emotional right now,

36:11.085 --> 36:14.046
it's causing you to say a lot of things,
most of which I didn't hear.

36:14.130 --> 36:16.299
'Cause you not listening to me!

36:16.382 --> 36:19.302
I'm telling you she's innocent.
Mr. Siegel, please.

36:19.385 --> 36:22.680
I'm begging you, please.
I can't let Taystee go down like this.

36:22.763 --> 36:24.098
There's gotta be some way.

36:24.182 --> 36:26.976
There's got to be some way
that we can make it right.

36:27.810 --> 36:32.982
Look, Cindy, putting aside the fact
that I can't make heads or tails

36:33.065 --> 36:35.359
of what you may or may not have
just said to me,

36:36.485 --> 36:38.404
you're giving testimony in a few hours.

36:38.487 --> 36:40.990
If you deviate
from your written statement,

36:41.073 --> 36:44.035
your deal will be rescinded,
you'll be deemed an unreliable witness.

36:44.118 --> 36:46.704
I should have said something sooner,
but I was scared.

36:46.787 --> 36:48.623
Man, do you know what... [sighs]

36:49.457 --> 36:53.044
I've been around scumbag cops
my whole life.

36:53.127 --> 36:56.047
I know what they do
to people like me when we talk.

36:56.130 --> 37:00.509
Changing your testimony at the 11th hour
will not help Ms. Jefferson's case.

37:00.593 --> 37:04.347
Listen to me. You won't help her,
but you will end up hurting yourself.

37:04.430 --> 37:06.224
But she didn't do it.

37:06.307 --> 37:09.101
Then let's hope the jury determines that.

37:10.436 --> 37:14.440
But as far as you helping her,
it's too late.

37:14.523 --> 37:16.025
[sighs]

37:16.108 --> 37:18.444
I am urging you, as your legal counsel,

37:18.527 --> 37:20.947
to testify to the statement
you gave the feds.

37:21.030 --> 37:24.200
There's no point
in adding years of extra time

37:24.283 --> 37:27.495
on top of what is already
a painful situation.

37:31.374 --> 37:32.500
Ms. Hayes?

37:41.968 --> 37:42.969
Where's Caputo?

37:43.052 --> 37:46.973
He told me I was meeting with my lawyer
to talk about my case against MCC.

37:47.056 --> 37:50.643
And I imagine he wants to take the case
public to embarrass MCC, correct?

37:50.726 --> 37:53.145
I'm assuming you ain't the lawyer, then?

37:53.229 --> 37:55.982
No. I fact, I'm the senior vice president
of MCC.

37:56.065 --> 37:57.024
[chuckles]

37:58.234 --> 38:01.821
I should have known.
Never trust a white woman with a weave.

38:01.904 --> 38:04.490
You can trust me.
I'm one of the good ones, I assure you.

38:04.573 --> 38:07.702
If you was one of the good ones, you
wouldn't be working for Evil Incorporated.

38:07.785 --> 38:09.078
Look, Ms. Burset,

38:09.161 --> 38:13.416
I know you suffered greatly
under the previous administration at MCC.

38:13.499 --> 38:16.460
But part of my mission
as the new senior vice president

38:16.544 --> 38:19.213
is to correct the mistakes
of my predecessors.

38:19.297 --> 38:20.298
Right.

38:20.381 --> 38:25.136
How do you intend to correct
the six months I spent in isolation

38:25.219 --> 38:30.808
without decent food or sunlight, or ever
laying my eyes on another human being

38:30.891 --> 38:34.228
except for those giant walking potatoes
you call guards?

38:34.312 --> 38:37.315
I would like to personally apologize

38:37.398 --> 38:40.443
for the horrendous mistreatment
that you endured.

38:40.526 --> 38:42.653
But I assure you that under my leadership,

38:42.737 --> 38:46.615
such inhumane torture
will never take place at Litchfield again.

38:46.699 --> 38:50.703
As reparation, I would like to offer you
a settlement of $300,000.

38:50.786 --> 38:52.788
I've gotten the go-ahead
from my superiors.

38:52.872 --> 38:56.375
I could have the funds transferred
to your bank by this afternoon.

38:56.459 --> 38:58.794
All you have to do is sign an agreement

38:58.878 --> 39:01.630
promising not to file
or testify against MCC.

39:05.426 --> 39:07.303
So this is hush money?

39:07.386 --> 39:09.430
Consider it an act of good faith.

39:10.056 --> 39:14.018
Clearly, it's not enough to make up
for the trauma that you suffered,

39:15.144 --> 39:19.148
but it is my hope that
it will help you get back on your feet

39:19.231 --> 39:20.900
after your early release.

39:22.234 --> 39:24.528
[laughs] Did you say early release?

39:24.612 --> 39:25.946
I did.

39:26.030 --> 39:30.493
As long as you agree not to sue, testify
or ever speak of this conversation.

39:32.161 --> 39:33.162
Damn.

39:35.456 --> 39:37.458
You really are a good witch.

39:41.587 --> 39:44.673
[Sharon] Let's join hands
for today's group prayer.

39:45.424 --> 39:48.969
Um, Maria, would you like to lead us?

39:50.012 --> 39:52.139
Um, I'll give it a try.

39:53.808 --> 39:55.309
Dear God...

39:57.061 --> 40:00.856
today we pray for the strength
to follow your teachings.

40:00.940 --> 40:05.069
To be peacemakers, to be pure of heart,

40:05.152 --> 40:08.739
to be merciful,
because that shit ain't easy...

40:08.823 --> 40:11.450
There are a lot of bitches in here
that don't deserve mercy,

40:11.534 --> 40:14.829
and sometimes it feels
like no matter how hard you try,

40:14.912 --> 40:17.665
you'll just end up
right back where you started.

40:17.748 --> 40:21.710
So we ask for your support
in trying to do the right thing

40:21.794 --> 40:26.590
and for your guidance
in knowing which way to go.

40:26.674 --> 40:29.802
And I'm sorry about saying
shit and bitch. Twice.

40:30.386 --> 40:31.887
-Amen.
-[Sharon] Amen.

40:31.971 --> 40:33.431
That was very moving, Maria.

40:34.014 --> 40:36.142
-[Beth] I'd like to share something.
-Yes.

40:36.225 --> 40:38.144
-Beth, go ahead.
-Maria.

40:38.727 --> 40:42.148
Your words just now about doing
the right thing really resonated for me.

40:42.231 --> 40:46.235
And to honor that,
I feel I need to make a confession.

40:48.404 --> 40:52.074
I was the one who tried to drown you
in the guard bathroom.

40:53.075 --> 40:56.078
I'm sorry. I have a compulsion.
Something comes over me.

40:56.162 --> 40:58.372
I've tried to deal
with this problem on my own,

40:58.456 --> 41:03.419
but being in this group has taught me
that I need put it in the Lord's hands.

41:05.087 --> 41:06.046
That was you?

41:06.130 --> 41:10.134
Yes, but it led you here, right?

41:10.801 --> 41:13.637
I guess the Lord works
in mysterious ways.

41:13.721 --> 41:15.931
This got nothing to do with the Lord.

41:17.391 --> 41:20.519
You fucking tried to kill me,
you fucking bitch.

41:20.603 --> 41:22.771
They wanted to keep me in Psych.

41:22.855 --> 41:27.902
They made me say that I tried
to drown myself in a toilet.

41:27.985 --> 41:30.905
[stammering] I said I was sorry.

41:30.988 --> 41:31.906
Fuck you.

41:31.989 --> 41:34.283
Perhaps you might try
to speak from a place of love.

41:34.366 --> 41:39.413
You told me this was a baptism, but it was
an attempted murder by a baby killer.

41:39.497 --> 41:42.041
-Is that how you killed your babies too?
-Maria!

41:42.124 --> 41:45.127
-You drowned them in a toilet?
-Maria, please.

41:47.796 --> 41:50.716
Nah, I get it now.

41:50.799 --> 41:52.843
This whole thing is a joke.

41:52.927 --> 41:55.513
Y'all like to sit around
and talk about forgiveness,

41:55.596 --> 41:59.183
believing you're better than everyone else
because you talk to God

41:59.266 --> 42:00.392
so you can sleep at night.

42:00.476 --> 42:04.271
But you'll still just be as fucked up
as the rest of us.

42:07.566 --> 42:10.528
-But at least I can own it.
-Maria--

42:10.611 --> 42:12.029
Shut the fuck up.

42:16.492 --> 42:18.160
Was I wrong there?

42:19.495 --> 42:20.788
[knocking on door]

42:24.416 --> 42:26.877
Gladys, right? Sorry to bug you.

42:26.961 --> 42:30.965
Was hoping to trade you for some
of them oatmeal cream pies you got.

42:31.048 --> 42:32.424
Commissary's all out.

42:32.508 --> 42:33.759
What are you offering?

42:35.553 --> 42:36.470
Mmm...

42:38.639 --> 42:40.099
My own little recipe.

42:40.182 --> 42:43.727
The juice from the peach cups
makes for a smooth finish.

42:43.811 --> 42:46.730
You must love you some cream pie.

42:46.814 --> 42:48.816
Takes me back to my girlhood.

42:48.899 --> 42:51.610
I've been needin' an escape
from this place.

42:52.611 --> 42:56.156
How's about three for one?

43:11.672 --> 43:14.675
Mmm. You weren't kidding.
This is smooth.

43:14.758 --> 43:17.052
Another life, I could've been a vintner.

43:17.136 --> 43:20.681
Hey, quite a haul you got.
You win the numbers or something?

43:20.764 --> 43:22.308
Shit's rigged.

43:22.391 --> 43:24.184
My Uncle Eddie finally died.

43:24.268 --> 43:26.478
Old pervert left everything to me.

43:26.562 --> 43:29.315
Guess all that sitting on his lap
finally paid off.

43:29.398 --> 43:34.028
-Gotta play the long game. How'd he die?
-They said it was a heart attack,

43:34.111 --> 43:38.490
but something tells me
there was Viagra and a belt involved.

43:38.574 --> 43:40.409
[Frieda] He leave you any property? Why? You in the market?

43:44.580 --> 43:47.041
Oh, just making conversation.

43:47.124 --> 43:48.500
I didn't mean to pry.

43:48.584 --> 43:49.627
Not for nothing,

43:49.710 --> 43:55.799
but I always felt original flavor Doritos
were the only one worth their salt.

43:55.883 --> 43:59.511
'Cause you never had these.
These are smoked chili flavored.

44:00.095 --> 44:01.013
Bullshit.

44:01.096 --> 44:02.097
Bulltrue.

44:03.140 --> 44:07.269
They've got a kick that'll put hair
on your chest if you don't already got it.

44:07.353 --> 44:09.688
Mind throwing a bag in for me?

44:12.524 --> 44:14.193
That hooch was good.

44:17.988 --> 44:23.827
You didn't really think I was gonna go
for that Uncle Eddie bit, did you?

44:26.747 --> 44:28.540
Was worth a shot.

44:30.501 --> 44:34.004
Somebody help! She's trying to kill me!

44:34.088 --> 44:35.881
[clamoring]

44:36.965 --> 44:39.468
Wait, wait. Goddamn!

44:39.551 --> 44:42.471
You motherfucking bitch! You--

44:42.554 --> 44:43.847
[inmates clamoring]

44:45.557 --> 44:48.811
Carol and Barb? But I'm in last place!

44:49.478 --> 44:51.814
Oh, my God. We just moved Carol to Ad Seg.

44:51.897 --> 44:54.441
And Barb hasn't had an incident in years.

44:54.525 --> 44:56.819
Well, you can thank
your beloved new commissioner.

44:56.902 --> 45:00.531
You don't understand, Al.
I really need this money.

45:00.614 --> 45:03.283
Tony Robbins just extended his tour
with Pitbull,

45:03.367 --> 45:06.662
and I'm never gonna get any points
with Carol and Barb.

45:07.496 --> 45:08.330
[scoffs]

45:11.417 --> 45:14.169
-Why do you have that face?
-What face? I don't have a face.

45:14.962 --> 45:16.130
[Pennsatucky grunts]

45:16.213 --> 45:17.714
This is bullshit! Where's Chapman?

45:17.798 --> 45:21.593
If I had to guess, I'd say she's being
dragged to SHU right about now.

45:21.677 --> 45:24.012
So you better work on your dodging skills.

45:24.096 --> 45:26.265
Actually, she's right behind you.

45:30.894 --> 45:33.605
I didn't think
I'd be seeing you for a while.

45:33.689 --> 45:35.774
I know that you put drugs in my shoe.

45:38.569 --> 45:40.112
And I'm not afraid of you.

45:41.780 --> 45:43.365
I guess you're dumber than you look.

45:43.449 --> 45:45.617
Excuse me. I have an intramural to win.

45:45.701 --> 45:49.037
All right, ladies. I think that
that's enough pegging for right now.

45:49.121 --> 45:50.831
That's what he said.

45:50.914 --> 45:51.957
Who's he?

45:52.040 --> 45:53.417
[Piper] Let's see some sprints.

45:53.500 --> 45:56.587
Okay? You guys know the drill,
so up against the wall. Let's go.

45:58.338 --> 46:00.841
Glad to have you back, captain.
Things was getting weird.

46:02.551 --> 46:05.679
All right, on my mark.

46:05.762 --> 46:08.474
Ready. Get set.

46:08.557 --> 46:09.558
Go!

46:31.455 --> 46:33.123
-[groaning]
-[inmates exclaiming]

46:33.916 --> 46:35.792
Ahhh, I'm hurt!

46:35.876 --> 46:38.420
She ran into me.
She was running too fast.

46:38.504 --> 46:42.633
Like I been saying all along,
this kickball thing is way too dangerous.

46:42.716 --> 46:45.052
Maybe we should cancel it. For safety.

46:45.135 --> 46:46.345
[Alvarez] She looks hurt.

46:46.428 --> 46:49.139
I'm counting at least five points
from the neck up alone.

46:49.223 --> 46:50.557
I am way ahead of you.

46:51.558 --> 46:54.102
Technically, she didn't get hurt
because of kickball,

46:54.186 --> 46:55.687
she got hurt because you were running.

46:55.771 --> 46:58.607
That's true.
Running is not kickball-dependent.

46:58.690 --> 47:00.692
Are you serious?

47:00.776 --> 47:03.153
Her nose bone probably got pushed
back into her brain.

47:03.237 --> 47:05.572
-Kickball may have killed her.
-[Ginger] Sorry.

47:05.656 --> 47:08.033
The line of causality
is really tough here.

47:08.116 --> 47:11.078
I say you keep playing. Next time,
watch where the heck you're going.

47:11.161 --> 47:12.412
-What do you think, Al?
-Agreed.

47:12.496 --> 47:17.459
No sense ruining a good thing
over one accident. [sniffs]

47:18.001 --> 47:19.419
[clears throat]

47:19.503 --> 47:22.130
That is a lot of blood, though.
Think we should radio the EMTs?

47:22.214 --> 47:23.215
Yeah.

47:31.139 --> 47:33.684
Don't worry. I just came to get my shit.

47:33.767 --> 47:38.355
I don't wanna spend another second
in this stanky-ass, depressing place.

47:38.438 --> 47:41.567
-Aleida.
-Yeah. I don't wanna hear another word.

47:41.650 --> 47:45.821
You fucking white boys are all the same.
A bunch of pussies.

47:45.904 --> 47:47.197
Put the bag down.

47:47.281 --> 47:49.908
Hey, don't touch me. I said I'm done.

47:53.036 --> 47:54.121
[Nana] Ricky!

47:54.204 --> 47:55.789
One second, Nana!

47:57.499 --> 47:59.793
We do this for three months.

47:59.876 --> 48:03.964
Get enough money for you to get your
kids back, maybe get a bigger place.

48:04.047 --> 48:06.425
And then we're out, you understand?

48:06.508 --> 48:09.636
[scoffs] Three months? Three months
ain't enough time to get shit.

48:09.720 --> 48:13.056
It is if we fill the whole containers,
not just the bottoms.

48:15.642 --> 48:19.730
Look, you were right. Okay? About my life.
I've been going through the motions,

48:19.813 --> 48:23.650
living for little highs here and there,
but mostly doing nothing.

48:24.943 --> 48:29.740
Then I met you, and all of a sudden,
I'm excited to get up in the morning.

48:29.823 --> 48:32.284
I actually feel like I'm fucking alive.

48:32.367 --> 48:35.537
Like I can do shit. Like, manly shit.

48:36.288 --> 48:40.834
I didn't know that I could feel this way.
I can't go back to the way it was before.

48:43.128 --> 48:45.088
So I guess that means I'm all in.

48:51.345 --> 48:54.640
I'm glad you finally understand
how lucky you are to have me.

48:58.393 --> 49:00.979
Wait. Ain't your nana gonna hear us?

49:01.063 --> 49:04.191
She has over 70% hearing loss
in both ears.

49:04.274 --> 49:07.569
-I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you.
-Yeah, you are.

49:11.239 --> 49:12.157
Oh.

49:12.240 --> 49:13.241
Sophia.

49:14.534 --> 49:15.911
Uh...

49:15.994 --> 49:17.412
Thank you for coming in.

49:18.205 --> 49:19.206
This is Tania.

49:19.289 --> 49:21.166
Tania Fernandez.
Pleasure to meet you.

49:21.249 --> 49:24.378
Tania has graciously agreed
to represent you in your case.

49:24.461 --> 49:28.715
Yes. I believe this case has the potential
to set an important precedent

49:28.799 --> 49:31.301
for the hundreds of men and women
who are currently suffering--

49:31.385 --> 49:34.513
Let me stop you right there.
I'm not going to sue.

49:36.014 --> 49:36.848
What?

49:37.724 --> 49:41.978
I just wanted to tell you in person.
I'm not gonna fight this.

49:42.062 --> 49:43.105
[chuckles nervously]

49:44.231 --> 49:45.190
Why not?

49:45.273 --> 49:47.275
I met with the senior vice president
of MCC.

49:47.359 --> 49:49.611
-Please don't say Linda Ferguson.
-Linda Ferguson.

49:50.737 --> 49:54.783
She offered me a settlement
and I decided to take it.

49:54.866 --> 49:56.368
[sighs] Jesus Christ.

49:56.451 --> 49:57.619
[Tania] If I may interject.

49:57.703 --> 50:02.207
From my point of view, you actually have
a really good chance of winning this case.

50:02.290 --> 50:06.753
Can you promise me I'll win?
Because she just promised me $300K,

50:06.837 --> 50:09.923
which is being transferred
into my bank account as we speak.

50:10.006 --> 50:12.384
What about all the women
you could be helping?

50:12.467 --> 50:16.638
-What about Taystee? You owe it to her--
-I don't owe nobody shit.

50:17.305 --> 50:21.435
The only responsibility I got
is to my wife and my son.

50:21.518 --> 50:26.481
This money could provide for them the way
I shoulda been providing all these years.

50:26.565 --> 50:27.691
[scoffs]

50:27.774 --> 50:33.447
I could send my son to college,
so he don't end up like me, here.

50:33.530 --> 50:35.240
But don't you want your story heard?

50:35.323 --> 50:39.619
I'm done trying to be heard.
[whispers] Nobody's listening.

50:39.703 --> 50:42.456
My time here has taught me that much.

50:43.665 --> 50:44.499
[sighs]

50:45.125 --> 50:47.335
Besides, I already signed the papers.

50:55.552 --> 50:56.970
Barb wants to speak with you.

50:59.848 --> 51:04.478
According to this, you get more
with a smile than with scowls and lurking.

51:05.604 --> 51:07.272
That's news you can use.

51:09.900 --> 51:10.734
Get up.

51:17.824 --> 51:20.952
Nicky, baby, where you been hiding, girl?

51:22.996 --> 51:24.831
Well, to be honest, I had to rub one out.

51:24.915 --> 51:27.542
All that adrenaline
really got me worked up.

51:28.376 --> 51:29.211
[chuckles]

51:30.128 --> 51:31.296
You're too much.

51:32.923 --> 51:39.554
Hey, listen, I wanted to apologize
for our little murder snafu earlier.

51:39.638 --> 51:42.933
So embarrassing.
I hope you won't hold it against me.

51:43.016 --> 51:45.769
It gave me the blue balls
for the bloodlust.

51:45.852 --> 51:47.521
But we'll get 'em next time.

51:47.604 --> 51:49.397
Well, I don't know about that.

51:50.315 --> 51:54.152
Some of these ladies seem to think
that we might have a mole.

51:54.236 --> 51:56.905
Can you believe that?
I mean, who would do that to me?

51:56.988 --> 51:59.032
After the way I look after my girls.

51:59.115 --> 52:01.535
Looked to me like somebody
tipped off the ginger.

52:01.618 --> 52:05.038
Could be your CO playing both sides.

52:05.121 --> 52:08.208
I've heard your sister is big
on the cloak-and-dagger maneuvers.

52:08.291 --> 52:09.167
True.

52:09.251 --> 52:15.382
Or it could be someone with ties
to one of the ladies in C-Block.

52:15.465 --> 52:19.386
Maybe, you know, someone with
an old friend they're looking out for?

52:20.387 --> 52:22.305
Ah... [chuckles]

52:23.098 --> 52:24.933
You're talking about me and Reznikov.

52:25.016 --> 52:29.563
Annalisa thinks you were interested in her
right when things turned sour.

52:29.646 --> 52:32.983
Yeah. Interested in killing her
before she killed me.

52:33.066 --> 52:35.026
I turned her in to the feds. Remember?

52:35.110 --> 52:38.738
Or did your network of crack babies
miss that when doing their due diligence?

52:38.822 --> 52:40.282
I'm covering my bases.

52:40.365 --> 52:44.202
I must be having a stroke then, 'cause
it sounds to me like you're accusing me.

52:44.286 --> 52:46.288
-Take a seat with that attitude.
-Oh!

52:46.371 --> 52:49.958
You're just like a big shot now,
'cause you're fucking the heir apparent? Where was this gay phase when I was
at camp? Quite frankly, I am offended.

52:53.712 --> 52:57.924
It's all right, Diaz. I think it's been
a stressful day for everybody.

52:58.008 --> 52:59.426
Isn't that right, Nicky?

53:00.343 --> 53:01.344
Come here.

53:03.889 --> 53:08.018
Look, I am sorry that I accused you, okay?

53:08.101 --> 53:09.060
Uh-huh.

53:10.270 --> 53:14.190
I think it's this sobriety thing
that's got me all riled up.

53:14.274 --> 53:15.442
You don't have to tell me.

53:15.525 --> 53:18.486
I've already come four times today.
It's not even noon.

53:18.570 --> 53:20.989
[laughs] There's that mouth
of yours again.

53:21.072 --> 53:24.659
[grunts] You really crack me up,
you know that?

53:25.619 --> 53:31.082
Look, I'll keep my nose peeled.
See what I can't dig up.

53:31.166 --> 53:33.293
Yeah, I know you will.

53:34.586 --> 53:36.046
I'm glad we talked.

53:36.630 --> 53:38.465
Don't be such a stranger, okay?

53:38.548 --> 53:41.468
Barb really loves a visit
from her Nicky baby.

53:41.551 --> 53:44.763
Well, I would love to stay and chat,

53:44.846 --> 53:49.643
but after all this excitement,
orgasm number five awaits.

53:49.726 --> 53:54.898
So excuse me while I attend
to unfinished clitoris.

53:55.941 --> 53:56.983
Gentlemen.

54:02.113 --> 54:03.657
[panting]

54:08.161 --> 54:08.995
She's lying.

54:09.079 --> 54:11.623
Shut up! You fuckin' embarrassed me.

54:11.706 --> 54:15.210
Next time you make sure you see
what you think you see.

54:15.293 --> 54:19.089
Now, I need my Noxzema and my bed.

54:19.172 --> 54:21.383
I'm gettin' fuckin' rage lines.

54:39.192 --> 54:40.610
Son of a bitch.

55:16.312 --> 55:17.272
Cindy?

55:21.443 --> 55:23.528
Yo, what they got you in here for?

55:26.031 --> 55:27.574
[taps on seat] Cindy?

55:28.867 --> 55:30.243
[bus door closes]

55:33.913 --> 55:35.290
[sobs gently]

55:39.461 --> 55:41.463
-Any word on Dwight?
-[Alvarez] She's fine.

55:41.546 --> 55:46.092
Broke her nose again. What's left of it.
Luckily, it was mostly mush to begin with.

55:47.177 --> 55:48.636
Thought she was a goner.

55:48.720 --> 55:50.722
Next time,
I'll have to put my weight into it.

55:51.431 --> 55:56.102
There is something very,
very wrong with you.

55:56.186 --> 55:58.480
Yeah? Well, you better get used to it,

55:58.563 --> 56:03.026
'cause we're gonna be spending
a lot of long, hard years together.

56:03.902 --> 56:06.071
What did I ever do to you?

56:07.530 --> 56:11.451
What's the matter, cookie?
You crumbling already?

56:14.621 --> 56:15.663
[laughs]

56:15.747 --> 56:20.001
Must be hard. I bet you're probably
used to getting your way out there.

56:20.085 --> 56:24.005
But down in here,
I decide who stays and who goes.

56:24.089 --> 56:26.049
And I got a lot of time, Chapman.

56:26.132 --> 56:28.760
A lot of time to think.

56:36.976 --> 56:38.728
[lawyer] According to
your written testimony,

56:38.812 --> 56:43.108
you saw the defendant point a gun
at Desi Piscatella's head, correct?

56:43.191 --> 56:44.067
Yes.

56:44.150 --> 56:47.070
[lawyer] Where were you
when the CERT officers stormed the pool?

56:47.153 --> 56:48.488
[Black Cindy] I was in the closet.

56:48.571 --> 56:52.158
So you didn't see what happened when
the officers stormed the pool, correct?

56:52.242 --> 56:54.536
All you saw before you left the pool

56:54.619 --> 56:59.958
was Tasha Jefferson pointing a gun
at Desi Piscatella, correct?

57:07.507 --> 57:11.386
-[sighs]
-Ms. Hayes, is that correct?

57:12.971 --> 57:14.013
[sighs]

57:15.056 --> 57:16.057
Yes.

57:33.700 --> 57:36.369
Inmate Denning, get up.
You're coming with me.

57:36.453 --> 57:39.080
What? Why?

57:39.164 --> 57:40.790
Let's go. Move it.

58:24.709 --> 58:25.710
In.
