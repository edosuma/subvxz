<i>NARRATOR". The great metropolis of Londinium,
mighty capital of the Old World...</i>

00:14.349 --> 00:18.728
...is <i>enjoying another
of its famous crystal-clear days.</i>

00:18.895 --> 00:22.649
<i>But in the queen's private museum
in Chuckingham Palace...</i>

00:22.815 --> 00:27.946
<i>...something's rather foggy
about Lord Marmaduke Ffogg of Ffoggshire...</i>

00:28.112 --> 00:31.324
<i>...and his sister, Lady Penelope Peasoup.</i>

00:33.243 --> 00:36.996
<i>But what are these twisted twigs
of Londinium aristocracy up to?</i>

00:39.332 --> 00:42.585
<i>Purloining Her Majesty's
priceless snuffboxes?</i>

00:53.596 --> 00:58.893
<i>And then covering their tracks
with Marmaduke's own man-made fog?</i>

01:01.145 --> 01:05.608
<i>And shortly, in Commissioner Gordon's office,
on the other side of the Atlantic...</i>

01:05.775 --> 01:09.862
If you wish, Mr. President,
I can handle this myself.

01:10.029 --> 01:11.698
I'm going to Londinium this week...

01:11.864 --> 01:14.867
...for an International
Police Commissioner's Conference.

01:16.077 --> 01:18.288
Only Batman, Mr. President?

01:18.454 --> 01:22.208
I'll see if it can be arranged at once,
Mr. President.

01:28.047 --> 01:29.507
What an afternoon.

01:29.674 --> 01:31.843
It's like a Londinium fog.

01:32.010 --> 01:33.511
Uh, speaking of Londinium...

01:33.678 --> 01:36.556
...that was himself, the president,
speaking of Londinium?

01:36.723 --> 01:39.559
There have been unexplained robberies
in Londinium...

01:39.726 --> 01:43.771
...from which all the thieves have escaped
in what appears to be a man-made fog.

01:44.063 --> 01:46.608
I tried to persuade him
that I could handle the problem.

01:46.774 --> 01:51.321
Just as I've tried to persuade you, Barbara,
to take your vacation in Londinium with me.

01:52.905 --> 01:56.075
Two weeks fog-bound?
No, thank you, Daddy.

01:56.242 --> 01:59.370
Oh, well, maybe Batman
will be a little easier to convince.

01:59.537 --> 02:00.663
Batman?

02:00.997 --> 02:03.666
The president,
at the request of the first minister...

02:03.833 --> 02:05.918
...and Londinium's venerable Ireland Yard...

02:06.085 --> 02:09.255
...wants the Caped Crusader
to look into the strange situation.

02:10.590 --> 02:15.011
I think two weeks in Londinium
would be delightful, Daddy.

02:31.569 --> 02:32.904
Excellent, Master Robin.

02:33.071 --> 02:35.198
Your turn
at the Boy Scouts Vaudeville Show...

02:35.365 --> 02:38.326
...should prove
what I believe is called a doozer.

02:41.287 --> 02:43.164
Cool it, Ringo.

02:45.583 --> 02:47.418
Yes, commissioner.

02:48.086 --> 02:49.837
The president.

02:50.171 --> 02:52.382
The first minister.

02:53.508 --> 02:56.469
Venerable Ireland Yard.

02:57.178 --> 02:58.471
Londinium.

04:09.167 --> 04:12.295
<i>NARRATOR". And presently,
on a crystal-clear Gotham City night...</i>

04:12.462 --> 04:14.714
<i>...a luxury liner is about to sail.</i>

04:14.881 --> 04:16.257
Hello, Barbara, commissioner.

04:16.423 --> 04:20.011
Well, Bruce, what a pleasant surprise
to find you and young Dick...

04:20.178 --> 04:21.721
...among our fellow passengers.

04:21.887 --> 04:24.223
I've been called
on Wayne Foundation business...

04:24.390 --> 04:27.602
...and I thought that Dick here
might find the trip broadening.

04:27.769 --> 04:31.606
- Excuse me, sir. Your crate is safely aboard.
-Thank you, Alfred.

04:31.773 --> 04:35.443
I saw that immense thing
with your name stenciled on it on the pier.

04:35.610 --> 04:36.944
What do you have in it?

04:37.236 --> 04:39.989
I don't think that Dick
should neglect his studies...

04:40.156 --> 04:44.577
...so we brought along a thousand key works
of literature, his biological specimens...

04:44.744 --> 04:46.579
...and also his own desk.

04:46.746 --> 04:50.583
- Yes, I expect to study hard.
-it's a good thing you're going by ship, Dick.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.668
Here you are, commissioner.

04:52.835 --> 04:56.422
I just came down
to wish you bon voyage, begorra.

04:56.589 --> 04:59.759
That's very generous of you, Chief O'Hara.
Thank you very much.

04:59.926 --> 05:02.428
Any sign of the Dynamic Duo?

05:02.595 --> 05:04.597
I'm sure they're on board, Chief O'Hara.

05:04.764 --> 05:07.809
But knowing their dispositions,
I doubt we'll see much of them.

05:08.601 --> 05:10.478
All ashore that's going ashore.

05:10.645 --> 05:12.063
Well, good luck, commissioner.

05:12.230 --> 05:14.106
- Goodbye, everybody.
-Goodbye, chief.

05:14.273 --> 05:15.316
All ashore that's...

05:15.483 --> 05:19.612
I think a ship sailing is one of the most
exciting things in the world, don't you, Bruce?

05:19.779 --> 05:23.783
Glamorous, romantic,
a sense of mystery and adventure.

05:23.950 --> 05:26.285
Hard to beat in this humdrum world.

05:28.079 --> 05:30.998
<i>NARRATOR". While across the sea
in the treasure-filled gallery...</i>

05:31.165 --> 05:33.292
<i>...of Easterland House...</i>

05:37.463 --> 05:40.883
<i>What are our Londinium culprits up to now?</i>

05:41.050 --> 05:47.306
<i>Not Lady Easterland's precious horde
of jeweled Russian Easter eggs.</i>

06:08.661 --> 06:14.584
<i>Then once more covering their tracks
with Lord Ffogg's personal pea soup.</i>

06:16.544 --> 06:20.006
<i>And the following morning at Ffogg</i> Place...

06:20.840 --> 06:26.178
Marmaduke,
the authorities have called on Batman.

06:26.345 --> 06:29.473
The Caped Crusader from the colonies?
Why?

06:29.640 --> 06:35.855
In a last attempt to find out
who's been carrying out our little pranks.

06:36.022 --> 06:37.899
You don't seem any too alarmed.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.191
Why should I be?

06:39.358 --> 06:44.989
We have an advantage over Batman
that none of his other adversaries ever had.

06:45.698 --> 06:47.033
My invincible weapon.

06:47.199 --> 06:48.367
The pipe of fog.

06:48.534 --> 06:52.705
With it, we can make our entrances and exits
in fogbound secrecy.

06:52.872 --> 06:55.207
Our sorties of the past will be as nothing...

06:55.374 --> 06:57.293
...compared to what the future holds.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.128
Nothing?

06:59.295 --> 07:03.007
You call the count's coin collection,
the duchess's diamonds...

07:03.174 --> 07:06.052
...and Her Majesty's snuffboxes nothing?

07:06.218 --> 07:09.388
Nothing, compared to the Crown Jewels
in the Tower of Londinium...

07:09.555 --> 07:13.893
...with which we may conclude
our lives of crime.

07:14.393 --> 07:16.437
The Crown Jewels?

07:17.063 --> 07:20.608
Oh, Marmaduke, how utterly divine.

07:20.775 --> 07:23.152
Oh, yes, rather. Yes, rather, I say yes.

07:25.237 --> 07:27.740
<i>NARRATOR". Presently, in the dungeon
of a country manor house...</i>

07:27.907 --> 07:30.117
<i>...rented by Bruce Wayne near Londinium...</i>

07:30.284 --> 07:32.870
<i>...the Dynamic Duo are ready for action.</i>

07:33.037 --> 07:35.164
Well, it isn't exactly the Batcave, sir.

07:35.331 --> 07:38.834
In fact, I strongly suspect
that at one time, it was a dungeon.

07:39.001 --> 07:43.464
But, uh, it does have an isolated entrance
connecting direct with the Queen's Highway.

07:43.839 --> 07:45.216
It will do the job, Alfred.

07:45.383 --> 07:48.094
And you did a great job
unpacking Dick Grayson's books...

07:48.260 --> 07:50.012
...biological specimens and desk.

07:50.513 --> 07:52.431
And not even a scratch on the Batmobile.

07:53.224 --> 07:55.601
And the Batcomputer
seems right at home too.

07:55.768 --> 07:56.811
Let's go, old chum.

07:56.978 --> 08:00.815
Commissioner Gordon will be waiting for us
at venerable Ireland Yard.

08:01.816 --> 08:05.695
And if I may, sir,
remember to drive on the left, not the right.

08:18.624 --> 08:20.960
<i>NARRATOR". In no time at all,
they are entering Londinium...</i>

08:21.127 --> 08:24.964
<i>...which is suffering
from a spell of unusually clear weather.</i>

08:28.467 --> 08:31.804
<i>And turning off the Queen's Highway
into Barnaby Street...</i>

08:36.808 --> 08:39.395
Blimey. The Batmobile.

08:40.980 --> 08:44.150
<i>NARRATOR". Then a moment later
in the office of Superintendent Watson...</i>

08:44.316 --> 08:46.444
<i>...in venerable Ireland Yard...</i>

08:46.610 --> 08:49.905
Superintendent Watson, I'd like you
to meet the Caped Crusader, Batman.

08:50.072 --> 08:52.158
- How do you do?
-And the Boy Wonder, Robin.

08:52.324 --> 08:55.661
- How do you do? It's a pleasure to meet you.
-it's our pleasure, sir.

08:55.828 --> 08:57.830
You, of course, know my daughter Barbara.

08:58.289 --> 08:59.415
Yes, we do.

09:00.416 --> 09:02.668
These surroundings have a familiar feel.

09:02.835 --> 09:07.173
Yes, Batman, decor in a police department
varies little the world over.

09:07.339 --> 09:09.341
When did you arrive in Londinium, Batman?

09:09.675 --> 09:11.218
We didn't see you on our liner.

09:11.385 --> 09:13.637
It's a large ship, Ms. Gordon.

09:13.804 --> 09:17.266
Well, superintendent, I suppose
this small talk is slightly out of order...

09:17.433 --> 09:21.145
...in the face of your current criminal crisis.
-It is indeed, Batman.

09:21.312 --> 09:24.065
Just one mysterious theft after another.

09:24.231 --> 09:27.401
We had hoped that they would end
with Her Majesty's snuffboxes...

09:27.568 --> 09:33.616
...but earlier this week, these same pilferers
invaded the gallery of Easterland House.

09:33.783 --> 09:37.536
And swept off with a precious horde
of Russian jeweled Easter eggs.

09:37.703 --> 09:39.330
I read that in the ship's bulletin.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.832
Ah, swept out is right, Batman.

09:41.999 --> 09:46.295
And under cover
of what seemed to be a man-made fog.

09:46.462 --> 09:49.173
- Holy haziness.
-You say there are signs...

09:49.340 --> 09:52.093
...of this strange fog
at the scene of every robbery.

09:52.551 --> 09:54.095
It's almost a trademark.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.055
Fog.

09:56.222 --> 09:58.891
Fogbound. Foghorn.

10:00.142 --> 10:02.770
- Aftergrass.
- Aftergrass?

10:02.937 --> 10:06.899
Yes, aftergrass is a form of lawn,
sometimes called fog.

10:07.066 --> 10:09.819
Beautiful too. Ffogg Place in Ffoggshire...

10:09.985 --> 10:13.405
...has one of the finest aftergrass lawns
in the country.

10:13.572 --> 10:14.740
Ffogg Place.

10:14.907 --> 10:18.494
The famous baronial estate
of Lord Marmaduke Ffogg?

10:18.661 --> 10:20.621
- Oh, you've heard of it?
- Oh, yes.

10:20.788 --> 10:22.915
His fog lawn is world-renowned.

10:23.082 --> 10:27.753
Superintendent, what would be the chances
of our looking around Ffogg Place?

10:27.920 --> 10:29.964
You, Batman? Heh.

10:30.131 --> 10:35.136
Surely you don't suspect Lord Ffogg,
one of our most respected aristocrats.

10:35.719 --> 10:40.015
No, my friend, millionaire Bruce Wayne
has a magnificent aftergrass lawn...

10:40.182 --> 10:42.434
...at stately Wayne Manor,
outside of Gotham City.

10:42.601 --> 10:45.104
I'd like to compare it with Lord Ffogg's...

10:45.271 --> 10:50.317
...while I assemble my thoughts
about our ubiquitous iniquitous enigma.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.194
Ooh! Good. Good.

10:52.361 --> 10:54.780
Lord Ffogg and his sister,
Lady Penelope Peasoup...

10:54.947 --> 10:59.118
...also run a posh girl's finishing school there.
They're quite proud of it.

10:59.285 --> 11:03.122
And I always like to get outside Londinium,
you know, into the countryside...

11:03.789 --> 11:07.793
...gives me a chance
to change hats, you know. Ha, ha.

11:08.210 --> 11:11.797
I'll call Lady Peasoup right now.

11:14.842 --> 11:17.970
Batman and Robin coming here? Why?

11:18.137 --> 11:22.892
Superintendent Watson said something
about our aftergrass lawn.

11:23.058 --> 11:24.185
Yes, Prudence?

11:24.351 --> 11:27.062
Lady Prudence, Aunt Penelope.

11:27.229 --> 11:31.483
I came to tell you the girls and I are back
from our little shopping expedition, governor.

11:31.650 --> 11:34.153
Mission accomplished.

11:34.445 --> 11:36.405
Good, Lady Prudence.

11:36.572 --> 11:38.324
Please have the girls freshen up.

11:38.490 --> 11:41.994
Ffogg Place is about to play host
to Batman and Robin.

11:42.494 --> 11:44.622
The Dynamic Duo?

11:44.788 --> 11:46.832
Smashing.

11:46.999 --> 11:49.960
I doubt that Batman is coming in
to look at any lawn, Penelope.

11:50.127 --> 11:51.712
But one false move...

11:51.879 --> 11:54.048
...and he'll be 6 feet under it.

11:54.215 --> 11:56.342
- Call Basil.
-Right here, your lordship.

11:57.426 --> 11:59.511
And I couldn't help overhearing, sir.

11:59.678 --> 12:02.932
I'll have the chauffeur and footman
start preparing a grave at once.

12:03.098 --> 12:04.183
Not right now, Basil.

12:04.350 --> 12:07.102
But when you do, make that two graves.

12:07.269 --> 12:11.357
We may need a second one
for Robin, the Boy Wonder.

12:20.366 --> 12:26.914
<i>NARRATOR". Thus again, very shortly,
Ffogg Place prepares to receive its visitors.</i>

12:52.773 --> 12:54.275
Hello there.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.319
Oh, Batman and Robin,
how nice of you to come.

12:57.486 --> 12:59.822
And Superintendent Watson, and, uh...

13:01.073 --> 13:04.410
Lady Peasoup, may I present Ms. Gordon.

13:04.576 --> 13:07.121
Her father is police commissioner
of Gotham City.

13:07.288 --> 13:09.498
While he's attending a meeting
in Londinium...

13:09.665 --> 13:13.752
...I thought I'd bring
his charming daughter along with us.

13:13.919 --> 13:16.338
Welcome to Ffogg Place, my dear.

13:16.505 --> 13:18.257
Thank you.

13:18.424 --> 13:20.175
Oh. The gout again, Lord Ffogg?

13:20.342 --> 13:22.303
Not again. Always.

13:23.470 --> 13:26.640
- Oh.
-Lady Prudence.

13:26.807 --> 13:31.812
His Lordship's daughter, my niece.
She helps with the school.

13:32.021 --> 13:33.063
How do you do?

13:33.230 --> 13:34.606
- Duchess.
- How do you do?

13:34.773 --> 13:36.275
- Kit.
- How do you do?

13:36.442 --> 13:38.277
- Daisy.
- How do you do?

13:38.444 --> 13:40.612
- Rosamond.
- How do you do?

13:40.821 --> 13:42.031
They're our boarders.

13:42.364 --> 13:45.200
Our daily students are away on holiday.

13:45.367 --> 13:48.620
Lady Prudence, will you please stay here
and entertain our guests?

13:48.787 --> 13:52.291
And, young ladies, may I suggest
that you get back to your, uh, studies.

13:53.792 --> 13:57.379
A refreshing innovation,
no school uniforms.

13:57.546 --> 14:02.176
Well, our little student bodies
have their clothes specially designed...

14:02.343 --> 14:03.635
...on Barnaby Street.

14:03.802 --> 14:08.307
We like them to have individuality
and to keep their wits about them.

14:08.474 --> 14:09.725
Their wits?

14:09.892 --> 14:12.603
Oh, they must learn to handle themselves
in this world.

14:12.770 --> 14:15.939
So full of sham and deception.

14:16.106 --> 14:18.525
Did you finish, my dear?

14:18.692 --> 14:22.237
Finish? Oh, I graduated from college,
if that's what you mean.

14:22.571 --> 14:23.947
Heh.

14:24.281 --> 14:28.160
A college graduate from across the sea.

14:28.327 --> 14:33.499
But it might be most interesting
to add you to our faculty.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.876
What's this about aftergrass, Batman?

14:36.043 --> 14:39.546
I'm quite interested in fog lawns,
Lord Ffogg.

14:40.297 --> 14:41.548
There it is. Help yourself.

14:51.433 --> 14:54.019
As nice a lawn
as millionaire Bruce Wayne's, Batman?

14:54.186 --> 14:56.355
A fine stand of fog grass, Ms. Gordon.

14:56.522 --> 14:58.023
He was on our ship, you know.

14:58.190 --> 15:01.068
I wonder where he's staying in Londinium.

15:01.235 --> 15:04.029
I can't help you there, Ms. Gordon.

15:06.490 --> 15:09.743
A handsome fog lawn, Lord Ffogg.

15:10.119 --> 15:11.954
My, what an interesting pi--

15:12.121 --> 15:14.540
One of my most beloved possessions,
Batman.

15:14.706 --> 15:18.043
I promised them a look around the school,
Lady Peasoup.

15:18.210 --> 15:19.962
Heh. What fun.

15:20.129 --> 15:23.841
Uh, Lady Prudence, perhaps you would
show Robin around the grounds...

15:24.007 --> 15:25.801
...while I take care of the others.

15:25.968 --> 15:28.178
Smashing.

15:28.971 --> 15:32.599
Could I be excused from the tour,
Lady Peasoup, and use your phone?

15:32.766 --> 15:35.978
I just remembered,
an old friend of mine from Gotham City...

15:36.145 --> 15:38.021
...may be living close by.

15:38.188 --> 15:40.899
Of course, my dear.

15:43.318 --> 15:47.239
Now, Basil, will you please show Ms. Gordon
the telephone in the hall?

15:47.406 --> 15:49.658
Of course, Your Ladyship.

15:55.247 --> 15:59.001
And we can start with the judo room
in the girl's gymnasium.

15:59.168 --> 16:02.045
A judo room?
An unlikely sport for young gentlewomen.

16:13.474 --> 16:17.019
Quick, Scudder, it's bug time.
Advise the others.

16:34.286 --> 16:36.455
Operator, I'd like--

16:45.214 --> 16:50.010
I'd like the number of Londinium's
Temporary Visitors' Registration Office, please.

16:51.887 --> 16:56.016
<i>NARRATOR". Shortly, in the Londinium Batcave
near the Queen's Highway...</i>

16:56.183 --> 16:58.519
But how in the world did you find me,
miss?

16:58.810 --> 17:01.897
I'll explain later, Alfred. But right now...

17:03.815 --> 17:05.526
Just a minute.

17:16.662 --> 17:19.830
I've slipped an anti-eavesdrop plug
into the phone, Alfred.

17:24.002 --> 17:26.171
Now, you can do me a great favor if you'll...

17:27.673 --> 17:32.803
<i>NARRATOR". While in the dormitory of
Lady Peasoup's pretty little student bodies...</i>

17:33.011 --> 17:35.764
Oh, isn't Batman the grooviest?

17:35.931 --> 17:37.516
You're right, Duchess.

17:37.683 --> 17:42.187
And that Robin.
I'm out of my skin over him.

17:42.479 --> 17:45.691
I wish we'd stolen some sharp threads today
on Barnaby Street.

17:45.857 --> 17:49.111
Instead of that old silver tea service
His Lordship wanted.

17:49.278 --> 17:52.364
You two flunked your course
in thread lifting, don't you remember?

17:52.531 --> 17:56.827
- Well, you'll have to take it over.
-Oh, and that Lady Prudence.

17:56.994 --> 17:59.329
Her father's pet.

17:59.496 --> 18:02.207
Well, let's just hope
she isn't talking too much.

18:02.374 --> 18:04.710
I guess I've been talking too much.

18:04.876 --> 18:07.296
But this place is greeby.

18:07.462 --> 18:08.714
Greeby?

18:08.880 --> 18:10.716
It's supposed to be a finishing school.

18:11.925 --> 18:14.928
We're being finished all right,
with an MS degree.

18:15.512 --> 18:19.016
- MS?
-Mistresses of Shoplifting.

18:19.182 --> 18:21.935
That's what Lady Peasoup
meant about using our wits.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.896
Holy contributing
to the delinquency of minors.

18:25.063 --> 18:29.651
But you won't tell Batman, will you?
I'd be roped outwith the governor.

18:30.736 --> 18:32.404
Roped out with the governor?

18:32.571 --> 18:35.240
In big trouble with my father.

18:35.866 --> 18:38.577
<i>NARRATOR".
While on another section of the grounds...</i>

18:38.744 --> 18:40.495
What's that, Lady Peasoup?

18:40.662 --> 18:43.332
Oh. A beehive.

18:43.498 --> 18:45.667
Special pets of Lord Ffogg's.

18:45.834 --> 18:47.586
African death bees.

18:47.753 --> 18:50.839
One sting and you're finished. Ha, ha.

18:51.423 --> 18:54.259
But he has so few other interests.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.390
But where is Ms. Gordon?

19:00.557 --> 19:02.517
I haven't the foggiest notion.

19:02.684 --> 19:05.103
Strange you should put it just that way,
Lord Ffogg.

19:05.270 --> 19:06.605
She has left.

19:06.772 --> 19:09.274
Basil was telling me
that the friend that she called...

19:09.441 --> 19:11.068
...is picking her up outside.

19:11.234 --> 19:13.612
She said she'd phone her father and explain.

19:13.779 --> 19:16.615
And she does hope you understand,
superintendent.

19:16.782 --> 19:18.617
Hmm. It seems very odd.

19:19.284 --> 19:22.287
She also says that she'll call me later.

19:22.454 --> 19:26.291
She might be interested
in joining our faculty, Marmaduke.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.293
Uh, for a short while, anyway.

19:29.127 --> 19:30.962
Perhaps we ought to be leaving, Batman.

19:31.129 --> 19:32.464
A pity.

19:32.631 --> 19:36.718
Maybe you could head back for your office.
We'll join you as soon as Robin--

19:36.885 --> 19:39.388
- I'm right here, Batman.
- Good.

19:39.554 --> 19:40.722
Good day, Lord Ffogg.

19:40.889 --> 19:43.642
We found your fog lawn most impressive.

19:43.809 --> 19:47.062
Thank you, Batman.
I'm sorry you found me indisposed.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.857
- Lady Peasoup.
- I'll see you out.

19:51.149 --> 19:54.945
Our servants are at tea. Ha, ha.

20:00.826 --> 20:03.036
Well, Prudence,
how did you make out with Robin?

20:03.203 --> 20:04.871
He's greeby, governor.

20:05.038 --> 20:08.166
Perhaps we've seen the last
of those two Dynamic Dunderheads...

20:08.333 --> 20:11.336
...if the household staff aren't still at tea.

20:11.503 --> 20:14.339
<i>NARRATOR".
And on a country road near Ffogg Place...</i>

20:14.506 --> 20:16.883
I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this, Alfred.

20:17.050 --> 20:19.177
No trouble, miss.
Your directions were perfect.

20:19.344 --> 20:21.346
I found the key to the flat you rented...

20:21.513 --> 20:26.268
...borrowed this cab from my second cousin,
Cuthbert, and, hey, presto...

20:28.103 --> 20:30.522
...Batgirl's clothes.
-Oh, thank you, Alfred.

20:30.981 --> 20:32.733
Something's very wrong in Ffogg Place.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.819
I'm afraid Batman and Robin
are headed for a lot of trouble.

20:35.986 --> 20:37.112
Of course, as usual...

20:37.571 --> 20:39.531
...our secret must not be disclosed.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.201
Mum's the word, miss.
Would you like me to wait for you?

20:43.368 --> 20:45.662
Oh, no, I'll be all right.

21:05.974 --> 21:11.646
<i>NARRATOR". So while Barbara Gordon begins
her tantalizing transformation into Batgirl...</i>

21:11.813 --> 21:15.901
<i>...the visitors leave Ffogg Place
and start back to Londinium.</i>

21:17.444 --> 21:21.364
<i>Through the fog-free countryside.</i>

21:22.741 --> 21:24.743
<i>But what's this?</i>

21:25.410 --> 21:27.662
Holy roadblocks.

21:28.079 --> 21:31.917
And some rather unholy highwaymen,
I'm afraid, Robin.

21:32.751 --> 21:35.295
Shouldn't be too hard to take that Batman.

21:35.712 --> 21:38.006
He looks like a slow bowler to me.

21:38.173 --> 21:39.466
And that youngster...

21:39.800 --> 21:42.427
...we'll make mincemeat out of him.

21:42.761 --> 21:44.888
Why wait?

21:45.972 --> 21:47.933
Come on, governor.

21:48.099 --> 21:49.267
Get out of that car.

21:50.769 --> 21:52.312
Come on, mate.

21:52.479 --> 21:53.855
Shake a leg.

22:29.975 --> 22:32.394
- Batgirl.
-Batgirl?

22:52.080 --> 22:54.207
Holy show-ups, that Batgirl.

22:54.374 --> 22:56.668
She does make a colorful reinforcement,
all right.

22:56.835 --> 22:59.337
I don't want her to think
we can't fight our battles.

22:59.504 --> 23:00.714
Gosh, no, Batman.

23:00.881 --> 23:03.174
What do you suppose she's doing
in Londinium?

23:03.341 --> 23:04.718
Where do you suppose she went?

23:04.885 --> 23:08.263
I can't answer the first.
I've never been able to answer the second.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.891
- And where do you suppose she went in?
-Or on.

23:11.057 --> 23:14.102
Those thugs looked like
the footman, the butler, the chauffeur.

23:14.269 --> 23:16.062
I did notice a similarity.

23:16.229 --> 23:19.190
Let's go back to Ffogg Place
and clean it up once and for all.

23:19.357 --> 23:22.027
Unless Lady Prudence was conning me,
plenty to clean up.

23:22.193 --> 23:24.446
I'm sure there is, but it's hostile territory.

23:24.613 --> 23:28.617
I suggest we return to our Londinium Batcave
and regroup our forces.

23:28.783 --> 23:30.827
Right as rain, Batman.

23:46.718 --> 23:49.888
Why on Earth did you invite that girl
to join our faculty, Penelope?

23:50.055 --> 23:52.766
She's the daughter of Gotham City's
police commissioner.

23:52.933 --> 23:55.685
Who no doubt has a direct line
to Batman himself.

23:55.852 --> 23:59.439
- Wherever he may be.
-Oh, but that's exactly why I did it, Marmaduke.

23:59.606 --> 24:03.610
To keep an eye on the doings
of the Batman brigade through her.

24:03.777 --> 24:07.238
And if necessary, we would have a hostage.

24:07.405 --> 24:08.907
You're a dizzily clever woman.

24:13.578 --> 24:16.081
Holy surprise parties.

24:19.459 --> 24:22.879
<i>NARRATOR".
Has Basil, Lord Ffogg's friendly butler...</i>

24:23.046 --> 24:26.424
<i>...succeeded in befogging the Dynamic Duo?</i>

24:26.591 --> 24:30.553
<i>ls Batman up against a sticky wicket?</i>

24:30.720 --> 24:36.267
<i>Our next episode will give you much more
than a foggy notion.</i>
