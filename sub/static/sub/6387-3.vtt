What?

18:31.377 --> 18:34.446
You kind of just finger
blasted me out of nowhere.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.047
I know, I know.

18:36.081 --> 18:37.348
I'm sorry.

18:37.383 --> 18:38.683
Look, I don't know who you've
been talking to,

18:38.717 --> 18:40.819
or what kind of porn
you've been watching,

18:40.853 --> 18:42.887
but girls in the real world,
we don't go from kissing

18:42.921 --> 18:45.489
to finger banging
in a matter of seconds.

18:45.524 --> 18:47.625
You're right, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

18:47.660 --> 18:52.329
I've been watching so much porn
on the Internet lately.

18:52.364 --> 18:54.765
And I've been seeking so much
sexual gratification,

18:54.800 --> 18:57.200
that it's like I don't even know
how to relate

18:57.235 --> 18:58.573
to real women anymore.

18:58.693 --> 18:59.791
Clearly.

18:59.911 --> 19:02.838
Yeah, it's as if going ATM
has become <i>de rigueur.</i>

19:03.295 --> 19:05.616
Um...What--

19:05.873 --> 19:07.641
Ass to mouth.

19:07.675 --> 19:09.743
- Oh, that's not good.
- I know.

19:09.777 --> 19:11.678
No, I mean you could get an infection.

19:11.712 --> 19:15.882
I know.

19:27.260 --> 19:31.663
Oh, what do we have here?

19:34.733 --> 19:36.901
Hey, who's this clown?

19:36.935 --> 19:38.569
Just some old guy from earlier
who keeps hitting on me.

19:38.603 --> 19:42.139
Said he'd give me $30 for a hand job.

19:42.174 --> 19:44.341
Oh, are we playing that game
now, are we?

19:44.375 --> 19:45.741
Yo, pal...

19:45.776 --> 19:47.710
Why don't you just
take a walk somewhere?

19:47.744 --> 19:50.179
Why don't you just kiss my
turd cutter, little lumberjack?

19:50.213 --> 19:52.347
Okay.
So what's up?

19:52.381 --> 19:54.082
- Oh, no.
- You wanna get hit?

19:54.116 --> 19:56.818
You wanna dry thumb up the ass?

19:56.852 --> 19:58.019
You had to think about it, right?

19:58.053 --> 19:59.287
You wanna just get out of here?

19:59.321 --> 20:00.488
No, no, no.
Come...

20:00.522 --> 20:01.655
- Gladly.
- No, no, no.

20:01.690 --> 20:03.023
- You don't want to do that.
- Why not?

20:03.058 --> 20:05.092
'Cause I'm in charge of
getting you home safely.

20:05.126 --> 20:06.527
No, I'm in charge of getting
me home safely.

20:06.561 --> 20:08.262
Now you're just splitting hairs.

20:08.296 --> 20:09.930
Little hairs.
Pubic hairs.

20:09.965 --> 20:11.265
Well that's impossible.

20:11.300 --> 20:12.733
'Cause I don't have any pubic hairs.

20:12.768 --> 20:14.335
Oh, come on.
Why would you want to do that?

20:14.369 --> 20:16.471
What's wrong with a little hair
down there?

20:16.505 --> 20:18.907
You kids today with your
self-loathing pube abuse.

What about you, Buster?

20:20.342 --> 20:22.510
- Keep a clean playground?
- What the fuck?

20:22.544 --> 20:24.278
It's a simple question, brosephine.

20:24.313 --> 20:27.081

of course, everyone does.

20:33.019 --> 20:35.154
You really think you're having
better sex than your parents?

20:35.188 --> 20:37.656
You think that your father loved
your mother's beautiful pussy

20:37.690 --> 20:39.391
any less because she had more
hair down there?

20:39.425 --> 20:40.992
Don't be talking about my mom's pussy.

20:41.026 --> 20:42.761
What?
I said it was beautiful, man.

20:57.275 --> 21:00.511
Now this is more like it.

21:00.545 --> 21:02.680
I still can't believe you gave
that guy a titty-twister.

21:02.714 --> 21:04.948
Mm...

21:04.983 --> 21:08.084
The titty-twister is frowned
upon in some circles,

21:08.119 --> 21:12.422
but it's actually a remarkably
effective street-fighting tool.

21:12.457 --> 21:15.326
And it can diffuse a potentially
incendiary situation.

21:15.360 --> 21:16.760
And it provokes laughter.

21:16.795 --> 21:18.295
You see that?
What'd I tell you?

21:18.330 --> 21:21.799

Well, that's an amazing place...

21:56.235 --> 21:58.403
- Yeah.
- To be from.

21:58.438 --> 22:00.772
Well how many of us make it
from there to here?

22:00.806 --> 22:02.507
Doesn't matter.
You did.

- We'll see how long I last.
- I heard your music.

I don't think you have anything
to worry about.

You leave tonight.

22:15.623 --> 22:17.857
Yes sirree ma'am.

- Let me ask you a question.
- Mm-hmm.

22:19.326 --> 22:21.461
If you're leaving tonight,
like, this very night...

22:21.495 --> 22:22.962
Yeah.

22:22.997 --> 22:27.801
What's the harm
in a good-bye kiss?

22:27.835 --> 22:30.103
Well, when you put it that
way, it's hard to see the harm.

I know, right?
