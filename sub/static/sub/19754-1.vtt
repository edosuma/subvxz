14:14.849 --> 14:16.589
Yeah.

14:19.587 --> 14:21.355
Hey.

14:21.356 --> 14:23.756
Tell Tucker I'll buy him a new one.

14:30.998 --> 14:32.966
All the meds came back fine.

14:32.967 --> 14:34.435
Baby is perfect.

14:34.436 --> 14:36.474
And Mommy is completely healthy, too,

14:36.475 --> 14:38.571
except for a slight
Vitamin D deficiency.

14:38.573 --> 14:41.573
You need to get some more sun, girl.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.546
Have you made the father
aware of your decision?

14:43.547 --> 14:46.012
Um...

14:46.013 --> 14:47.713
no.

14:47.715 --> 14:48.749
Do I have to?

14:48.750 --> 14:50.250
No, not legally.

14:50.252 --> 14:51.352
But if he can be a part of the process,

14:51.353 --> 14:52.553
it does make things easier.

14:52.554 --> 14:54.254
He can't be.

14:54.256 --> 14:55.525
I don't even know where he is.

14:55.526 --> 14:57.053
Left you to fend for yourself, huh?

14:57.058 --> 14:59.460
Don't feel bad, sweetie.

14:59.461 --> 15:02.561
You are not the first girl
to lay down with a loser.

15:02.564 --> 15:05.764
Well, don't know that he's a loser.

15:05.767 --> 15:07.067
He just can't be involved.

15:07.068 --> 15:08.235
May I?

15:08.236 --> 15:09.603
Do you know him?

15:09.604 --> 15:12.339
No, I'm just not quick to judge.

15:12.340 --> 15:14.170
I guess it's the Christian in me.

15:14.176 --> 15:15.476
Mmm.

15:15.477 --> 15:17.411
So, who's the lucky family?

15:17.412 --> 15:20.781
Uh, the Stolnjaks.

15:20.782 --> 15:23.482
Oh my God, I can't wait to call them.

15:23.485 --> 15:25.525
Seven long years they've been waiting,

15:25.526 --> 15:28.080
and you are their Super Lotto ticket.

15:28.089 --> 15:29.727
They're gonna be so thrilled.

15:29.728 --> 15:31.854
Why don't you go ahead
and sign the contract

15:31.859 --> 15:33.469
so I can call the Stolnjaks?

15:49.711 --> 15:52.881
You're doing a wonderful
thing for this family.

15:52.882 --> 15:55.610
And for your baby.

16:03.558 --> 16:06.228
Excuse me, I need to use the bathroom.

16:09.631 --> 16:12.701
It's great that she's got you
for support, Reverend Curtis.

16:12.702 --> 16:15.469
It just tears my heart to
see some of these young girls

16:15.470 --> 16:17.230
just get left in the cold by men

16:17.239 --> 16:18.949
who don't care enough
to do the right thing.

16:18.950 --> 16:20.740
Not even by their own kid.

16:20.742 --> 16:22.409
No moral backbone.

16:22.410 --> 16:25.440
Not enough men like you, am I right?

16:27.549 --> 16:31.117
Can... can we... can
I keep this for her?

16:31.118 --> 16:32.753
Sure.

Agnes Christian Family Services.

16:57.545 --> 17:00.514
Boy, you really messed
this place up, didn't you?

17:00.539 --> 17:01.642
Yeah.

17:01.683 --> 17:02.883
I'll make it good, though.

17:02.908 --> 17:04.694
Jessie know you're doing this?

17:04.719 --> 17:05.886
Yes, sir.

17:05.887 --> 17:08.025
Nothing a fresh coat
of paint can't fix, huh?

17:08.026 --> 17:10.652
Hey, um, you need some
money for the supplies,

17:10.657 --> 17:12.528
you just let me know,
I can help with that.

17:12.529 --> 17:14.127
No, my debt, no sir.

17:14.127 --> 17:15.738
I pay.

17:19.300 --> 17:21.300
You know what I'm up against, huh?

17:21.303 --> 17:23.002
Yeah.

17:23.003 --> 17:26.839
But I know God won't fail us.

17:26.840 --> 17:31.311
Listen, Keith, I'm trying
to make this situation

17:31.313 --> 17:32.713
right for both of us.

17:32.714 --> 17:34.414
Yeah.

17:34.416 --> 17:36.583
But they got a witness.

17:36.584 --> 17:37.651
Who?

17:37.652 --> 17:40.982
I don't have a name
yet, but when I do...

17:43.190 --> 17:44.550
I don't want to hurt anybody.

17:44.559 --> 17:48.569
I just... use this.

17:49.864 --> 17:53.334
You give him $40,000. You
keep the rest for yourself.

17:53.335 --> 17:55.235
No, I don't want your money.

17:55.236 --> 17:58.672
No, I do this for God
and for my Solomon.

17:58.673 --> 18:00.873
Don't... don't call me that, okay?

18:00.875 --> 18:02.743
I'm not Solomon, I'm not anointed.

18:02.744 --> 18:06.141
- But you are.
- I'm Pernell Fucking Harris.

18:06.147 --> 18:08.181
And I'm charged with murder.

18:08.182 --> 18:09.652
God talks right to you.

18:09.653 --> 18:10.748
Not anymore he doesn't.

18:10.773 --> 18:12.421
I haven't had a hallucination

18:12.422 --> 18:15.020
or heard a voice since
we spread P.J.'s ashes.

18:18.059 --> 18:19.565
Don't look at me like that.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.791
That's the one thing I've
got to be thankful for.

18:21.796 --> 18:23.696
If there was a God,
I'd thank him for that.

18:23.698 --> 18:26.833
There is a God, and he shines.

18:26.834 --> 18:29.374
If there was a God, my
son would still be alive.

18:33.775 --> 18:36.575
I'll call you when I get a name.

18:36.578 --> 18:38.818
For I know the plans I have for you,

18:38.819 --> 18:40.681
declares the Lord.

18:40.682 --> 18:43.282
Plans for welfare, not for evil,

18:43.284 --> 18:47.384
to give you a future and a hope.

18:47.389 --> 18:49.423
Jeremiah, 29:11.

18:49.424 --> 18:51.654
I'm sorry, Keith.

18:51.659 --> 18:55.161
I just don't believe that shit anymore.

18:55.162 --> 18:57.592
That's all right.

18:57.599 --> 19:00.039
I'll believe enough for the both of us.

19:13.515 --> 19:15.782
Hey, thanks for coming.

19:15.783 --> 19:18.053
Yeah, my driver's coming
back around in five minutes.

19:18.054 --> 19:19.252
What's up?

19:19.253 --> 19:21.953
Just enough time to have a toast.

19:21.956 --> 19:24.825
Hell of a good time to be Robert Boston.

19:24.826 --> 19:27.193
Here's to approval ratings
going through the roof.

19:27.194 --> 19:29.563
Okay, you're not listening. We
can't make this an all-nighter.

19:29.564 --> 19:32.433
We got to toast to me, too, though.

19:32.434 --> 19:35.101

I'm turning my back on you?

19:44.746 --> 19:47.046
I'm just keeping my distance
until these charges are handled.

19:47.048 --> 19:48.918
- You don't see that?
- Hold on, hold on.

19:48.919 --> 19:51.452
I haven't even told you the best part.

19:51.453 --> 19:53.753

that connects me to the body.

20:00.161 --> 20:02.961
Oh... shit.

20:04.198 --> 20:05.599
Is that possible?

20:05.600 --> 20:07.130
A witness?

20:07.134 --> 20:10.874
I don't think you've
got time for that talk.

20:12.006 --> 20:13.373
Shit.

20:13.374 --> 20:14.941
Don't worry about it.

20:14.942 --> 20:17.742
All you've got to do is
reach out to Pete Janacek,

20:17.745 --> 20:19.945
get me the name of this witness.

20:19.947 --> 20:21.416
Why you can't reach out to him?

20:21.417 --> 20:24.785
Same reason you can't be
seen with me, man. I'm toxic.

20:24.786 --> 20:26.653
And I'm an elected official.

20:26.654 --> 20:28.084
You want me to lean
on a grand jury clerk?

20:28.089 --> 20:29.699
That's Watergate waiting
to happen. See what I mean?

20:29.700 --> 20:31.621
You're good at being careful.

20:37.665 --> 20:40.465
Sometimes being careful
means saying "No."

20:40.468 --> 20:42.106
My shit is heating up, Pernell.

20:42.107 --> 20:44.503
My name's coming up
in Sacramento and D.C.

20:44.506 --> 20:46.446
For real, man.

20:47.408 --> 20:49.142
You want congratulations?

20:49.143 --> 20:51.943
No, I want you to understand
what's at stake right about now.

20:51.946 --> 20:53.446
I understand.

20:53.447 --> 20:56.950
I understand exactly what
happens if I go on trial.

20:56.951 --> 20:59.281
You don't think Toby and
McCauley want to take you down

20:59.286 --> 21:00.621
right alongside me?

21:00.622 --> 21:03.852
They're going to dig into
everything we've done.

21:03.858 --> 21:06.593
They're going to find things.

21:06.594 --> 21:08.862
They're going to put
you on the stand, Bobo.

21:08.863 --> 21:10.893
Right along the same time
people are going to be deciding

21:10.898 --> 21:12.968
whether to re-elect Robert Boston,

and you'll be all over TruTv,

bring in a cop for questioning.

21:19.240 --> 21:21.140
That dead cop.

I get you a name, and you do what?

21:24.245 --> 21:27.245
No witness, no trial.

21:29.283 --> 21:30.613
Not like that.

21:30.618 --> 21:32.085
Then like what?

21:32.086 --> 21:34.955
You just give me the
name of the witness.

21:34.956 --> 21:37.626
I'll take care of it for the both of us.

25:51.045 --> 25:53.645
What about Anne Wu?

25:53.647 --> 25:56.817
She did order the rape. She
did steal P.J.'s program.

25:56.818 --> 25:58.355
How could you be right about that?

25:58.356 --> 26:00.452
I don't have that part
of it figured out yet.

26:03.257 --> 26:06.392
All I know is it wasn't God.

26:06.393 --> 26:07.593
Whenever you're ready.

26:07.594 --> 26:08.594
- I'm ready.
- I got this.

26:08.595 --> 26:10.130
[beeping]

26:10.131 --> 26:11.591
Warning, you are outside
the designated zone.

26:11.598 --> 26:12.966
My ankle monitor.

26:12.967 --> 26:14.467
Return to an authorized location.

26:14.468 --> 26:16.837
I'm supposed to stay
within a certain distance

26:16.838 --> 26:17.838
of the address I gave them.

26:17.839 --> 26:19.539
Well, then you better get going.

26:19.540 --> 26:21.640
Well, it'd be okay if we
were at your sister's house.

26:21.642 --> 26:23.842
Go home.

26:24.711 --> 26:27.141
Crys. Crys?

26:30.773 --> 26:35.431
Police gave me a box of P.J.'s stuff.

26:36.656 --> 26:40.126
[beeps] Warning, you are
outside the designated zone.

26:40.127 --> 26:42.327
Return to an authorized location.

26:46.533 --> 26:48.701
Shane never told me
that he was involved.

26:48.702 --> 26:49.932
He tried to keep you out of it.

26:49.937 --> 26:51.471
You heard him on there, right?

26:51.472 --> 26:53.402
You heard his voice. He
didn't want to be there.

26:53.407 --> 26:55.876
He didn't have a choice.

26:55.877 --> 26:58.144
No, this is too risky.

26:58.145 --> 26:59.885
Julio, if they find
out what you're doing...

26:59.886 --> 27:02.081
Only one person is going to find out.

27:04.919 --> 27:06.089
Do you think he's gonna pay?

27:06.090 --> 27:08.454
He's obsessed with his son.

27:08.455 --> 27:11.395
When he sees what is on
this video, he'll pay.

27:13.060 --> 27:17.990
Heather, there's no
one to protect anymore.

27:17.999 --> 27:19.609
Except you.

27:27.274 --> 27:28.604
[chuckles]

27:30.344 --> 27:32.544
Which one's yours?

27:32.546 --> 27:33.779
Bottom.

27:33.780 --> 27:36.480
Mm-hmm.

27:39.453 --> 27:41.023
[pigeons cooing]

27:54.035 --> 27:57.205
They come every day. Tammy
leaves seeds for them.

28:05.947 --> 28:08.087
Mind if I...

28:32.739 --> 28:37.010
$471 and 26 cents.

28:37.011 --> 28:39.381
What was he doing with all that cash?

28:39.382 --> 28:40.610
You want it?

28:40.614 --> 28:41.982
No.

28:41.983 --> 28:43.849
I think he read an article.

28:43.850 --> 28:46.380
Decided credit cards were evil.

29:27.728 --> 29:29.398
[sighs]

29:59.893 --> 30:01.493
Still smells like him.

30:13.940 --> 30:15.540
Didn't P.J. give this to you

30:15.542 --> 30:17.610
for your birthday?

30:17.611 --> 30:19.811
I thought I lost that.

30:19.813 --> 30:21.083
About two years ago.

30:21.084 --> 30:23.612
What's P.J. doing with my signing pen?

30:26.720 --> 30:28.380
Signing his suicide note?

30:30.124 --> 30:34.524
[laughs]

30:44.771 --> 30:46.701
[cries]

31:15.669 --> 31:17.409
[sobs]

31:24.010 --> 31:25.310
[footsteps]

31:25.312 --> 31:27.182
I'm looking for Judge Harris.

31:27.183 --> 31:29.551
He isn't in.

31:30.417 --> 31:31.657
Do you know when he will be?

31:31.658 --> 31:34.452
What's this about?

31:34.455 --> 31:36.155
I'll come back later.

31:54.908 --> 31:56.418
Drive safely.

31:59.980 --> 32:01.680
Come back with me, Crys.

32:01.682 --> 32:05.412
I'm serious, let's
just get all your things

32:05.419 --> 32:06.788
and get out of here right now.

32:06.789 --> 32:07.857
Don't push it, Pernell.

32:07.858 --> 32:10.590
I have to.

32:10.591 --> 32:13.291
I love you.

32:13.294 --> 32:16.229
It's more than that.

32:16.230 --> 32:18.730
I can't live without you.

32:18.732 --> 32:21.262
If I didn't have this shit on my ankle,

32:21.268 --> 32:22.935
I would go buy a Winnebago right now

32:22.936 --> 32:24.876
and park it in your
fucking sister's front yard.

32:24.877 --> 32:26.471
Oh, right.

32:26.473 --> 32:27.803
You see? You see?

32:27.808 --> 32:29.314
If we play this thing right,

32:29.315 --> 32:31.310
maybe we'll be back to laughing one day.

32:31.312 --> 32:32.812
What's here, Crys?

32:32.813 --> 32:35.413
Back in San Vicente,
you were throwing galas.

32:35.416 --> 32:36.586
You were going to opening
night of the ballet.

32:36.587 --> 32:38.453
Your big night here is, what?

32:38.454 --> 32:40.752
The Voice? Couple of boxes of wine?

32:43.224 --> 32:46.259
Crys?

32:46.260 --> 32:48.760
That's how easy it is.

32:48.762 --> 32:49.762
What?

32:49.763 --> 32:51.693
You said "wine".

32:51.698 --> 32:53.368
I thought of the wine
bottle. I thought of Anne.

32:53.369 --> 32:55.437
I thought if I hadn't
gotten there before you,

32:55.438 --> 32:58.371
I never would've...

32:58.372 --> 33:01.802
And how... I was only
going there to protect you.

33:01.808 --> 33:04.378
And how I hate...

33:07.814 --> 33:08.914
That's how easy it is.

33:08.915 --> 33:11.751
You love me.

33:11.752 --> 33:13.382
You remember that?

33:15.989 --> 33:17.729
Yeah, I do.

33:19.893 --> 33:22.323
But I remember everything,

33:22.329 --> 33:24.469
and it's not enough.

33:27.067 --> 33:28.467
Even for love.

33:34.941 --> 33:36.341
[horn honking]

33:50.291 --> 33:52.191
Asa?

33:52.192 --> 33:54.292
Are you Asa?

33:54.295 --> 33:57.530
Where's... where's Pernell?

33:57.531 --> 33:59.331
He's visiting his wife.

33:59.333 --> 34:01.163
He sent me.

34:01.167 --> 34:03.703
He said you got a name for me.

34:03.704 --> 34:06.672
Have him call me when he gets back.

34:06.673 --> 34:08.003
No, look.

34:08.007 --> 34:09.918
You're just going to tell
Judge Harris the name,

34:09.918 --> 34:11.540
he's going to tell me.

34:11.545 --> 34:14.112
So what's the difference?

34:14.114 --> 34:16.214
I know him, I don't know you, okay?

34:16.216 --> 34:19.685
No, no, I can't let you go
unless you tell me that name.

34:19.686 --> 34:22.322
Okay, okay, man. Just ease up.

34:22.322 --> 34:23.893
Ease up, man!

34:25.759 --> 34:27.065
I gotta... Oh, shit!

34:27.065 --> 34:28.460
Get the fuck off of me!

34:28.462 --> 34:29.562
Where were you going?

34:29.563 --> 34:31.362
Man, get the fuck off of me, man!

34:31.364 --> 34:33.032
I don't want to hurt you.

34:33.033 --> 34:35.681
Just tell me the name.

34:35.706 --> 34:36.871
I'll break this.

34:36.873 --> 34:39.570
Okay, Paul Curtis. Paul Curtis.

34:49.783 --> 34:51.853
Get the fuck off of me, man!

34:56.089 --> 34:57.859
[car starts]

35:14.441 --> 35:16.771
Hey, kid.

35:16.777 --> 35:18.544
It's Daddy.

35:18.545 --> 35:21.745
How are you doing?

35:21.748 --> 35:23.783
You ready?

35:23.784 --> 35:26.484
I hope you know I'm doing this for you.

35:26.487 --> 35:29.087
I hope someday that...

35:30.691 --> 35:32.391
you can forgive me.

35:34.428 --> 35:37.398
It's not 'cause I don't love you.

35:38.999 --> 35:40.539
It's because I do.

35:44.571 --> 35:48.401
You deserve a good family.

35:48.409 --> 35:50.049
A good daddy.

35:55.849 --> 35:57.089
[kisses]

36:01.254 --> 36:04.494
It's just tiny little
things. She has these tattoos.

36:04.495 --> 36:05.651
Oh, Jesus.

36:05.659 --> 36:07.226
On both of her boobs.

36:07.227 --> 36:08.997
Save one for me, role models.

36:11.297 --> 36:12.331
Here.

36:12.332 --> 36:14.099
No, no, no, no. She's 16.

36:14.100 --> 36:17.430
And I'm sure alcohol has
never passed her lips.

36:17.438 --> 36:19.805
Oh, no. Of course not.

36:19.806 --> 36:22.446
Hey, hey, I was 17 the first
time I ever tried any of that.

36:22.447 --> 36:24.610
Bullshit, you were eight.

36:24.611 --> 36:26.579
Eight? You were eight?

36:26.580 --> 36:30.080
Oh my God, yeah. When
I fell in the toilet.

36:30.083 --> 36:31.183
Wait, what happened?

36:31.184 --> 36:34.054
- Ask her.
- For God's sake.

36:35.155 --> 36:37.122
I...

36:37.123 --> 36:38.991
your mom and Aunt Sherry,

36:38.992 --> 36:41.492
they didn't want to go to
sleep and I was fucking tired.

36:41.495 --> 36:44.764
So I made them some hot chocolate.

36:44.765 --> 36:47.232
And put a little rum in it.

36:47.233 --> 36:49.733
Too much rum, way too much rum.

36:49.736 --> 36:52.106
Sherry just passed out, and your mom,

36:52.107 --> 36:53.605
she just got plain stupid.

36:53.607 --> 36:55.747
Yeah, I forgot to put
the toilet seat down.

36:55.748 --> 36:58.010
You fell in the toilet?

36:58.011 --> 37:00.181
I was a baby. I just fell in the seat.

37:00.182 --> 37:02.280
And this was a trailer toilet,

37:02.282 --> 37:03.912
so it's smurf piss.

37:03.917 --> 37:06.051
There's no water in there, okay?

37:06.052 --> 37:09.152
So, blue down there for like, a week.

37:09.155 --> 37:10.855
What'd you do, grandma?
Did you whup their asses?

37:10.857 --> 37:12.727
- No.
- Grandma wasn't there.

37:12.728 --> 37:15.326
No, she wasn't there.
Grandma was in the hospital.

37:15.328 --> 37:17.598
She was trying to pull a P.J.

37:20.667 --> 37:21.667
What do you mean?

37:21.668 --> 37:23.108
It was a long time ago.

37:23.109 --> 37:25.503
You know, ach. But pills.

37:28.675 --> 37:31.744
What? Sorry. Too soon?

37:31.745 --> 37:34.213
Over a month, you've been here.

37:34.214 --> 37:36.549
Never talked about P.J.

37:36.550 --> 37:39.050
Didn't even invite us to the funeral.

37:39.052 --> 37:42.552
You made us tip-toe all
around what happened.

37:42.556 --> 37:45.156
So this is how it comes up.

37:45.158 --> 37:47.727
Ma, she asked a question.

37:47.728 --> 37:48.994
I answered it.

37:48.995 --> 37:50.530
Of course you did.

37:50.531 --> 37:54.800
Why should I be so surprised you
wait until you can take it out on me?

37:54.801 --> 37:58.231
Oh. Take it out on you.

37:58.238 --> 37:59.778
P.J.

38:01.575 --> 38:04.345
I'm just talking about
how you weren't there

38:04.346 --> 38:07.182
because you swallowed a
bottle of sleeping pills.

38:07.183 --> 38:09.280
Okay, whatever we're
talking about, can we stop?

38:09.282 --> 38:10.950
- Please?
- No.

38:10.951 --> 38:13.251
No, no, no. We're here now.

38:13.253 --> 38:15.553
We are here and I would like to know.

38:15.556 --> 38:18.556
Did you ever once stop to think about

38:18.559 --> 38:22.862
how it would affect my sisters or me?

38:22.863 --> 38:24.630
You?

38:24.631 --> 38:26.561
[scoffs]

38:26.567 --> 38:29.201
You get out of your head, girl.

38:29.202 --> 38:32.572
I was to the point where I was
ready to take my last breath.

38:32.573 --> 38:34.573
I wasn't thinking about you.

38:37.310 --> 38:39.370
And I promise you,

38:39.379 --> 38:41.947
in that moment,

38:41.948 --> 38:46.988
your precious P.J. wasn't
thinking about you either.

38:49.089 --> 38:51.599
I'm sorry. Too soon?

38:54.327 --> 38:55.695
Mom.

38:55.696 --> 38:56.966
Ma, wait.

39:00.667 --> 39:02.607
We aren't the only ones
who miss him, you know.

39:04.204 --> 39:05.634
I'm not talking about P.J.

39:05.639 --> 39:07.677
But there's this memorial website.

39:07.678 --> 39:09.304
You should see it, Aunt Crystal.

39:09.309 --> 39:11.149
I mean, thousands of people
have posted messages for him.

39:11.150 --> 39:13.174
I mean, look, all
these people loved him.

39:13.179 --> 39:14.614
Jesus Christ.

39:14.615 --> 39:15.815
Are you deaf, are you stupid,

39:15.816 --> 39:18.425
or are you just being a fucking bitch?

39:27.828 --> 39:29.962

39:29.963 --> 39:31.793
Fuck, you gave him the name?

39:31.798 --> 39:34.637
Dad, he had me pinned on the ground
like we were fighting at recess.

39:34.638 --> 39:36.535
His knees were on my arms and shit.

39:36.536 --> 39:37.818
Hey, hey.

39:37.843 --> 39:38.931
Thanks.

39:38.939 --> 39:40.179
You could have made something up.

39:40.180 --> 39:42.003
Right? You got to be
quicker on your feet.

39:42.008 --> 39:43.275
Think.

39:43.276 --> 39:46.045
So he can find me and
kill me for lying to him?

39:46.046 --> 39:47.186
This is a bona...

39:48.782 --> 39:50.282
this is a bonafide killer
we're talking about.

Lower your voice. We don't
know that for sure. Fuck!

Man: Great party, Mayor Boston!

39:53.659 --> 39:55.320
I told you this was a mistake.

39:55.321 --> 39:57.221
I don't understand why you keep
putting yourself out there like that.

39:57.223 --> 39:58.693
Hey, you don't ask that question, okay?

39:58.694 --> 40:00.692
He's my friend, your
godfather. That's why.

Why are you empty handed?

40:14.941 --> 40:16.911
You know what, let's get you
a glass of champagne, huh?

40:16.912 --> 40:18.840
Pernell should be here, Robert.

40:18.845 --> 40:21.945
Yes, I talked to Pernell,

40:21.948 --> 40:23.217
and he agreed that having you

40:23.218 --> 40:25.116
represent the Harris
family trust was best.

40:25.118 --> 40:28.520
He hasn't been convicted of anything.

40:28.521 --> 40:30.589
Yes, ma'am, this is true,

40:30.590 --> 40:33.150
but people start trying his case
every time he walks into a room.

40:33.159 --> 40:35.728
Which would distract from the theme
of this evening, don't you think?

40:35.729 --> 40:38.530
Let me take care of some business.

40:38.531 --> 40:40.361
Hey, can I get your attention?

40:40.366 --> 40:42.805
I'm sorry, everybody.
Everybody, your attention please.

40:42.806 --> 40:44.103
Can you gather around?

40:44.104 --> 40:45.904
I want to thank everybody for coming.

40:45.906 --> 40:47.775
- I mean that.
- Good evening.

40:47.776 --> 40:50.612
You see this? This is a picture
of me when I was nine years old.

40:50.613 --> 40:53.779
And you could already see I
had an inspired sense of style.

40:53.780 --> 40:57.010
Am I rocking specs? I
think I'm rocking specs.

40:57.017 --> 41:00.219
I mean, whoever let me walk out of the
house wearing that Wizard of Oz bowtie

41:00.220 --> 41:01.720
should have been reported
to child protection services,

41:01.722 --> 41:03.382
but that's another story.

41:03.389 --> 41:06.096
But the reason I wanted
you to see this picture was

41:06.097 --> 41:08.122
that was the year that changed my life.

41:08.128 --> 41:10.166
When I was nine years old
I wrote a paper in school

41:10.167 --> 41:11.763
about what I wanted
to be when I grew up,

41:11.765 --> 41:13.765
and I said I wanted to
be a janitor, because

41:13.767 --> 41:15.536
my father was a janitor at city hall.

41:15.537 --> 41:16.835
And I worshipped my father.

41:16.837 --> 41:19.437
I got an A+ on that paper.

41:19.439 --> 41:22.077
Brung it home all proud, but
when I gave it to my father,

41:22.078 --> 41:24.175
he ripped it up right
in front of me and said,

41:24.177 --> 41:26.315
"Well, if all you want
to be is a janitor,

41:26.316 --> 41:28.142
what the hell do you
need an education for?"

41:28.148 --> 41:29.348
True story.

41:29.349 --> 41:31.884
I was lucky, I had a mother and father

41:31.885 --> 41:34.355
who made me dream big
and strive for more.

41:34.356 --> 41:36.454
I mean, it was obvious
my school didn't care.

41:36.456 --> 41:42.026
Now, I work in the same offices
where my father used to sweep and mop,

41:42.028 --> 41:43.495
and I'm not a janitor.

41:43.496 --> 41:46.396
My name is Robert Boston,
the mayor, your mayor,

41:46.399 --> 41:48.269
of San Vicente.

41:50.804 --> 41:52.604
Thank you, thank you so much.

41:52.605 --> 41:55.374
I appreciate it, I'm proud
of what I've accomplished.

41:55.375 --> 41:59.244
But the one thing I'm not
proud of is our schools.

41:59.245 --> 42:02.314
Public education is a
disgrace in this country,

42:02.315 --> 42:04.415
and I'm sorry to say, in our city, too.

42:04.417 --> 42:07.486
That's why I created
the REAL initiative.

42:07.487 --> 42:09.021
REAL.

42:09.022 --> 42:11.322
Reviving Education and Leadership.

42:11.324 --> 42:12.794
REAL. It will fix our schools.

42:12.795 --> 42:14.793
It will change our future.

42:14.795 --> 42:18.595
Bayard Rustin said, "The proof that
one truly believes is in action."

42:18.598 --> 42:19.804
Are we ready to take action?

42:19.805 --> 42:21.660
- Crowd: Yes!
- I know some of you are.

42:21.667 --> 42:24.536
The Harris Family Trust and
our host for this evening

42:24.537 --> 42:27.044
Nathan Brooks have each
committed 10 million dollars

42:27.045 --> 42:28.300
to the REAL initiative.

42:28.308 --> 42:29.308
Thank you.

42:29.309 --> 42:30.910
[cheering]

42:30.911 --> 42:32.171
Thank you so much.

42:32.178 --> 42:34.513
That means we're halfway there.

42:34.514 --> 42:35.984
They believe. Do you believe?

42:35.985 --> 42:37.449
Crowd: Yes.

42:37.450 --> 42:39.280
Then let's get them checkbooks out.

43:01.574 --> 43:03.304
[sighs]

43:09.415 --> 43:11.055
You awake?

43:16.722 --> 43:17.890
Yeah.

43:17.891 --> 43:20.891
I'm sorry.

43:20.894 --> 43:22.694
That's okay.

43:22.695 --> 43:26.865
No, it's not.

43:26.867 --> 43:29.467
My dad hit me once.

43:30.937 --> 43:32.977
A real punch.

43:35.108 --> 43:37.648
Mom said it was because
he was mad at the world,

43:37.649 --> 43:39.143
not at me.

43:39.145 --> 43:40.679
It's not okay, either.

43:40.680 --> 43:43.080
I'm just saying I get it.

43:49.689 --> 43:51.899
Do you know whatever
happened to P.J.'s software?

43:53.693 --> 43:55.893
No.

43:58.098 --> 44:00.268
Don't you think you should?

44:04.804 --> 44:06.304
[crowd chattering]

44:13.446 --> 44:16.116
I'm not that great at parties, either.

44:17.984 --> 44:20.531
So you're, what, a
wallflower billionaire?

44:20.556 --> 44:22.081
Seems a very unlikely combination.

44:22.122 --> 44:24.722
Not shy, bored.

44:24.724 --> 44:26.654
I'm afraid I lose interest
in most people fairly quickly.

44:26.659 --> 44:27.699
Hi, can I have water, please?

44:27.700 --> 44:29.323
Of course.

44:29.329 --> 44:32.639
I begin to tune them out and
then the conversation falls apart.

44:32.640 --> 44:34.199
Very funny.

44:34.200 --> 44:36.000
So you're not interested
in getting to know people

44:36.002 --> 44:38.532
face to face, but you want to collect

44:38.538 --> 44:40.206
every single bit of information
about them behind their backs.

44:40.207 --> 44:41.606
Is there any real difference
between me watching

44:41.607 --> 44:43.107
that woman over there
walk across the room,

44:43.109 --> 44:44.549
or watching her surf across the web?

44:44.550 --> 44:47.279
Yes, there is, she has no
expectation of privacy here.

44:47.280 --> 44:49.380
And what has the expectation
of privacy on the web given us?

44:49.382 --> 44:52.551
Silk road? Sex
trafficking and drug deals.

44:52.552 --> 44:56.152
You can't hide behind the most
egregious outliers of on-line society.

44:56.156 --> 44:58.196
You stole that line from your husband.

44:58.197 --> 45:00.691
I understand his concerns.

45:00.693 --> 45:02.623
I watched that manifesto of his.

45:02.628 --> 45:06.968
But P.J. was never willing
to take time to hear me out.

45:08.468 --> 45:10.478
Excuse me.

45:14.975 --> 45:16.805
You know what? I'm in.

45:16.809 --> 45:17.979
I'll hear you out.

45:17.980 --> 45:20.188
You have a minute.

45:22.782 --> 45:26.782
The world is generating 1.7 million
billion bytes of data per minute.

45:26.786 --> 45:29.154
Six megabytes per day for
every man, woman and child

45:29.155 --> 45:30.795
on the planet and almost
all of it is wasted.

45:30.796 --> 45:32.690
Dust in the digital wind.

45:32.692 --> 45:35.492
Who knows what else is hidden in all
that information we're throwing away?

45:35.495 --> 45:37.295
Big Pharma started sharing data,
you know what they figured out?

45:37.297 --> 45:41.333
That desipramine, an antidepressant
might help cure cancer.

45:41.334 --> 45:45.334
96% of the data gathered on
cancer patients goes unanalyzed.

45:45.338 --> 45:47.772
What else is hidden in there?

45:47.773 --> 45:49.203
Isn't that at least worth a look?

45:49.209 --> 45:52.116
Portland, Oregon massively
reduced its carbon footprint

45:52.117 --> 45:54.212
by using data to time
its traffic lights better.

45:54.214 --> 45:57.452
Tracking cell phones helped
contain Ebola in Africa.

45:57.453 --> 45:59.610
Tracking Ebola didn't
make you a billionaire.

45:59.619 --> 46:01.659
Knowledge is the engine of
our economy. Data is its fuel.

46:01.660 --> 46:05.024
And my company refines the
finest fuel in the world.

46:05.025 --> 46:08.325
From oil that you steal from people.

46:08.328 --> 46:09.894
Or whatever the fucking metaphor is.

46:09.895 --> 46:11.865
I just want to know, how
do people benefit from it?

46:11.866 --> 46:14.204
With enough data and enough analysis,

46:14.205 --> 46:16.460
there are no more Silk Roads.

46:16.469 --> 46:18.937
Not on the web, not on our city streets.

46:18.938 --> 46:21.246
I don't think that people
understand what they're giving up.

46:21.247 --> 46:22.401
And you don't understand how
much they will get in return.

46:22.408 --> 46:24.214
Are already getting in return.

46:24.215 --> 46:28.880
New algorithms tracking social media
are predicting potential suicides.

46:28.881 --> 46:29.941
Hmm.

46:29.949 --> 46:31.683
Time's up.

46:31.684 --> 46:34.719
Very nice party.

46:34.720 --> 46:36.320
If you're getting other
offers for Bathwater,

46:36.322 --> 46:38.092
- I'll beat 'em.
- I'm not.

46:38.093 --> 46:40.791
That program is worth...

46:40.793 --> 46:42.593
You could name a figure.

46:46.732 --> 46:48.400
Really?

46:48.401 --> 46:50.469
Really.

46:50.470 --> 46:54.700
I have absolutely no idea where it is.

46:54.707 --> 46:59.811
And even if I found it, I
would never sell it to you.

46:59.812 --> 47:01.642
I have to go home now.

47:24.104 --> 47:25.534
[glass breaks]

47:29.842 --> 47:32.572
[gasps]

47:32.578 --> 47:34.488
KD, how long you been there for?

47:34.489 --> 47:37.549
You really can't see
that he's been chosen?

47:37.550 --> 47:38.710
Who?

47:38.718 --> 47:40.152
Judge Harris.

47:40.153 --> 47:41.383
Chosen?

47:41.387 --> 47:42.787
You came crying to me not long ago

47:42.788 --> 47:45.857
because of the darkness
and sin Pernell lead you to.

47:45.858 --> 47:48.260
The Lord corrected my error.

47:48.261 --> 47:50.161
He sent me to correct yours.

47:50.163 --> 47:53.263
Judge Harris has been anointed by God.

47:53.266 --> 47:56.866
KD, I'm going home.

47:56.869 --> 47:59.037
No.

47:59.038 --> 48:00.544
I won't let you betray him.

48:00.545 --> 48:02.370
Pull your head out of the sand.

48:02.375 --> 48:03.705
He dragged you through a pit of evil.

48:03.709 --> 48:05.349
I would be failing you as a pastor...

48:05.350 --> 48:06.911
- Shut up!
- Oh, jeez.

48:06.912 --> 48:08.990
- Shut up!
- I'm...

48:10.044 --> 48:12.127
You are covered in the
blood of Jesus Christ.

48:12.152 --> 48:14.152
KD, don't let sin rule your heart.

48:14.154 --> 48:15.754
Listen to me.

48:15.755 --> 48:17.021
The things I said.

48:17.022 --> 48:21.592
Whatever you heard, things you've seen.

48:21.594 --> 48:24.694
Whatever you know, that
stays between us and God.

48:24.697 --> 48:25.764
Understand?

48:25.765 --> 48:27.532
I don't know what...

48:27.533 --> 48:30.403
Yes, or no.

48:31.871 --> 48:34.001
Yeah.

48:34.006 --> 48:38.510
This is from him.

48:38.511 --> 48:40.681
If it's me, I'm slitting your throat,

48:40.682 --> 48:42.840
and if you talk, I swear to God I will.

48:48.854 --> 48:50.254
[panting]

49:07.640 --> 49:09.470
Judge Harris?

49:09.475 --> 49:12.575
The witness was Reverend Paul.

49:17.217 --> 49:19.217
He's half the reason
why I'm in this shit.

49:19.219 --> 49:22.229
You don't have to worry about him.

49:27.427 --> 49:29.227
Thanks, Keith.

49:34.967 --> 49:36.607
[chattering]

49:37.770 --> 49:39.630
Well, you had your chance, boys.

49:39.639 --> 49:41.349
It was a nice shot. I'll give you that.

49:41.350 --> 49:44.241
But when you come
after somebody like me,

49:44.244 --> 49:45.710
it's a zero sum game.

49:45.711 --> 49:48.280
You either kill me or, well...

49:48.281 --> 49:49.641
you know.

49:58.458 --> 50:00.127
You give that back to Pernell.

50:00.128 --> 50:02.765
You tell him I'm not that guy
anymore and I never will be again.

50:02.766 --> 50:05.292
I told you, Reverend Paul.

50:05.298 --> 50:06.998
You testify, you die.

50:06.999 --> 50:09.334
Testify?

50:09.335 --> 50:10.805
What are you talking about?

50:10.806 --> 50:13.733
Here you go.

50:13.739 --> 50:15.349
The assholes want to
wait until the last second

50:15.350 --> 50:17.141
like we're doing a Law & Order episode.

50:17.142 --> 50:19.072
Let them play their games.

50:19.078 --> 50:23.014
So the witnesses name is
Mike Alcala. Ring a bell?

50:23.015 --> 50:24.685
[door opens]

50:57.483 --> 50:59.353
[phone rings]

51:05.625 --> 51:06.625
Yeah?

51:11.063 --> 51:12.993
You're kidding me.

51:20.906 --> 51:22.646
Nah, I'll be right there.

51:30.182 --> 51:31.712
Okay.

51:40.125 --> 51:42.694
You brought me all the way
back here for this bullshit?

51:42.695 --> 51:44.477
Just because you're getting fucked

51:44.502 --> 51:46.795
doesn't mean you should
let your membership lapse.

51:46.799 --> 51:50.139
You think there's American Judicial
Association meetings in prison?

51:50.140 --> 51:52.775
You need some gang to belong to.

51:53.773 --> 51:55.843
This was the last thing in my inbox.

51:55.844 --> 51:57.841
Oh, well...

51:57.843 --> 52:01.643
Well, now you have a Quizno's receipt.

52:01.647 --> 52:03.617
Stop being a crybaby.

52:17.930 --> 52:19.090
You okay, boss?

52:49.462 --> 52:51.462
I'm gonna...

52:51.464 --> 52:54.232
need you to print me out another copy.

52:54.233 --> 52:55.733
Okay.

53:15.254 --> 53:17.554
What you writing, Dad?
