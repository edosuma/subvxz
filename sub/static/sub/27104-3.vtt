00:06.006 --> 00:07.550
MIDGE: Ugh, I'm so late.
They're gonna kill me.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.343
ROSE: I'm late, too.
My class is at 8:00.

00:09.385 --> 00:10.678
MIDGE:
I'm late for work!

00:10.720 --> 00:11.971
ROSE:
That makes you more important?

00:12.012 --> 00:13.556
ABE:
My fancy socks are missing.

00:13.597 --> 00:15.182
Hey, is Zelda here yet?

00:15.224 --> 00:16.976
Which ones are your fancy socks?

00:17.017 --> 00:18.894
-I only have one pair
of fancy socks.
-MIDGE: They're the ones

00:18.936 --> 00:21.021
with the floating
martini glasses on them.

00:21.063 --> 00:22.815
Those are my comical socks!

00:22.857 --> 00:24.316
Why do you have comical socks?

00:24.358 --> 00:25.860
Are you talking about the ones
with pineapples on them?

00:25.901 --> 00:27.153
Those are comical socks, too.

00:27.194 --> 00:29.989
Why do you have two pairs
of comical socks?

00:30.030 --> 00:31.490
Abe, you're dressed.
Why are you asking about socks?

00:31.532 --> 00:33.784
Because I'm dressed
for the university.

00:33.826 --> 00:37.329
I go to Bell Labs later
and they dress more eclectic.

00:37.371 --> 00:40.040
Sounds like a job
for pineapple socks to me.

00:40.082 --> 00:42.793
I'll just bring a pair of fun,
weekend slacks for Bell Labs

00:42.835 --> 00:44.211
and change in the taxi.

00:44.253 --> 00:45.838
BOTH:
Do not change in the taxi.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.506
I don't have time
to change at school.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.675
BOTH:
Do not change in the taxi.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.343
-CHILD: Mama!
-Coming!

00:51.385 --> 00:52.970
ROSE: Why do you have
comical socks?

00:53.012 --> 00:55.055
-Did you call me?
-No.

00:55.097 --> 00:56.390
Could've sworn you called me.

00:56.432 --> 00:58.851
It's Zelda's day off,
by the way.

00:58.893 --> 01:00.269
No one told me.

01:00.311 --> 01:01.729
I told you multiple times.

01:01.771 --> 01:03.189
She was supposed
to watch the kids.

01:03.230 --> 01:04.565
Get their father to watch them.

01:04.607 --> 01:05.900
That's who should watch them.

01:05.941 --> 01:07.610
Tomorrow is Joel's day
to watch them.

01:07.651 --> 01:09.862
If you want to make a change,
give Joel a call.

01:09.904 --> 01:10.988
I am not calling Joel.

01:11.030 --> 01:13.574
There is no food and
I'm literally starving.

01:13.616 --> 01:15.409
You are not
"literally starving."

01:15.451 --> 01:16.827
-CHILD: Mama!
-Coming!

01:16.869 --> 01:18.078
ABE: I guess I don't get
to use the bathroom.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.538
ROSE:
Like I'm stopping you.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.041
Now, that time you called me.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.043
If it wasn't you, who was it?

01:24.084 --> 01:26.045
-Esther.
-Esther?

01:26.086 --> 01:28.047
Really?

01:28.088 --> 01:30.674
Hey! Hey, hey!

01:30.716 --> 01:32.051
Esther said a word!

01:32.092 --> 01:34.595
-She said a word?
-Good for her.

01:34.637 --> 01:36.263
Should we take a cab?

01:36.305 --> 01:37.807
No, walking's faster.

01:37.848 --> 01:39.225
When you're not in heels.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.519
-And you are not starving.
-I am, too.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.562
Then your muscle and tissue
would be breaking down.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.064
Your abdomen would be distended.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.107
-Your menstruation would cease.
-Abe, stop.

01:47.149 --> 01:49.235
-What is that?
-She said she was
literally starving.

01:49.276 --> 01:50.736
There is no food

01:50.778 --> 01:52.196
and I am literally,
figuratively starving.

01:52.238 --> 01:53.531
-I got to go!
-Me, too.

01:53.572 --> 01:55.741
What have I been saying?

01:57.743 --> 01:59.745
-Someone's got to stay.
-I can't stay.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.247
-None of us can stay.
-ESTHER: Mama.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.082
Call Mrs. Fulber, tell her
it's an emergency.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.875
-ROSE: This isn't an emergency.
-MIDGE: It kind of is.
-Mama.

02:04.917 --> 02:06.710
ABE: Now I'm second-guessing
these slacks.

02:06.752 --> 02:08.379
(overlapping chatter)

02:08.420 --> 02:10.005
B. Altman, where may I
direct your call?

02:10.047 --> 02:11.507
I will connect you.

02:11.549 --> 02:13.467
B. Altman, where may I direct
your call? I will connect you.

02:13.509 --> 02:15.261
B. Altman, where may I
direct your call?

02:15.302 --> 02:17.930
Yes, our Charleston Gardens
Restaurant is open today, ma'am,

02:17.972 --> 02:19.682
as it is every day.

02:19.723 --> 02:22.309
Oh, it's terrific. It's some
of the best food in town.

02:22.351 --> 02:24.687
Do not get the crab meat salad.

02:24.728 --> 02:26.313
The crab meat salad.

02:26.355 --> 02:27.940
It's Monday.
Crab's delivered on Tuesdays.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.984
-Do the math.
-O'TOOLE: Miriam Maisel.

02:30.025 --> 02:32.111
MIDGE:
Oh, Mrs. O'Toole.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.737
I was just suggesting things
from the menu.

02:33.779 --> 02:35.447
Headset down. Come with me.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.918
First floor.

02:49.587 --> 02:51.338
-Makeup Department.
-You're back in the show.

-Girls.
-B. Altman, where may I
direct your call?

-I'm not Mary's maid of honor.
-I told you, Viv,

04:12.252 --> 04:13.963
my sister had
to be maid of honor.

It's a family thing.

How's planning going?

04:16.507 --> 04:17.549
Oh, we've had

ANNOUNCER (over P.A.):
Attention, ladies.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.823
Rouge Master Class
begins in five minutes

04:40.864 --> 04:43.117
-at the Revlon Counter.
-Sweetie, I'm sorry,

04:43.158 --> 04:44.410
but you can't plan your wedding
by yourself.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.412
It's too much. Let me help.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.247
Oh, Midge, thank you,
but there's no time

04:48.288 --> 04:50.249
-and really no money.
-Don't worry about money.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.418
What you need is experience
and I have experience.

04:52.459 --> 04:55.004
The marriage didn't stick, but
my reception was unforgettable.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.755
-It got a write-up
in The Jewish Daily Forward,
-(gasps)

04:56.797 --> 04:58.465
in Yiddish, so it didn't get
a wide readership,

04:58.507 --> 04:59.925
but the picture was sensational

04:59.967 --> 05:02.553
and I can make the time
for you, my friend.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.930
-I don't know.
-Please. I want to.

05:04.972 --> 05:08.434
No one should have
a less than perfect wedding.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.185
Okay. Yes. Yes!

05:10.227 --> 05:11.937
-Good.
-Really good.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.772
I'm relieved.
I'll see you at lunch.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.315
See you at lunch.

05:20.195 --> 05:22.197
Look at this.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.949
The high ceilings,
the tile floor,

05:23.991 --> 05:25.117
like the Vatican.

05:25.159 --> 05:26.493
I feel like I forgot something.

05:26.535 --> 05:27.661
How are we doing here, Curren?

05:27.703 --> 05:29.413
MOISHE:
Why would a fakakta bank

05:29.455 --> 05:31.623
in the tuchus of Brooklyn
try to compete with the Pope?

05:31.665 --> 05:32.916
I need to start
writing things down,

05:32.958 --> 05:34.334
but by the time I find a pen,

05:34.376 --> 05:36.295
I forget what I was
supposed to write down.

05:36.336 --> 05:39.048
It's so open, so flaunting,
so gentile.

05:39.089 --> 05:40.549
Jews use the bank, too, Pop.

05:40.591 --> 05:42.009
Show me one. Hey.

05:42.051 --> 05:44.553
-You a Jew?
-Pop. Sorry.

05:44.595 --> 05:47.514
So, how close are we
to wrapping this up, Curren?

05:47.556 --> 05:49.058
Curren. What is that?

05:49.099 --> 05:51.185
Just making sure all the I's
are dotted here.

05:51.226 --> 05:53.562
-He dots the I's.
-And I've got a team
counting cash in the back.

05:53.604 --> 05:55.314
It'll take a while.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.025
-Only a goy dots the I's.
-I hope it's all there.

05:58.067 --> 05:59.610
The treasure map's
in pretty bad shape.

05:59.651 --> 06:00.903
-Treasure map?
-JOEL: It's just
what she calls her records

06:00.944 --> 06:02.321
marking where she put the money.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.989
Ma, what-what are you
looking for?

06:04.031 --> 06:06.116
I feel like I forgot something.

06:06.158 --> 06:09.203
Moishe, did you bring the bag
of money we use to bribe people?

06:09.244 --> 06:11.246
There's a bag of money
we use to bribe people.

06:11.288 --> 06:12.664
A little louder, Ma.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.249
I don't think they heard you
in Poughkeepsie.

06:14.291 --> 06:15.542
Curren, that's not a name.

06:15.584 --> 06:18.128
That's something
you pour over rice.

06:18.170 --> 06:19.546
And, Pop, Mr. Cleary
is my buddy Archie's brother

06:19.588 --> 06:21.340
and he's doing us
a big favor here.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.842
By taking our money? I wish
I could do someone that favor.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.637
-Mr. Curry, a question...
-Cleary. Cleary.

06:26.678 --> 06:28.722
Is there gonna be another
Great Depression soon?

06:28.764 --> 06:30.432
Is that something
you can tell us?

06:30.474 --> 06:32.476
If I could, I'd be
the president of the bank

06:32.518 --> 06:33.894
or the United States.

06:33.936 --> 06:35.896
Step on enough Jews,
you'll get there.

06:35.938 --> 06:38.732
Now I remember. I found this.

06:38.774 --> 06:40.818
It was behind
one of the radiators.

06:40.859 --> 06:42.778
Ma, you said you found
all the money.

06:42.820 --> 06:44.446
On the first treasure map.

06:44.488 --> 06:47.616
I found two more treasure maps
this morning.

06:47.658 --> 06:49.910
Oh, should we lock these up
in the safe?

06:49.952 --> 06:51.662
They show where
all our stashes are.

06:51.703 --> 06:54.373
-They're like gold.
-I'm in charge
of these from now on.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.667
Are we gonna be okay?

06:58.752 --> 06:59.878
You...

06:59.920 --> 07:02.256
are not Jewish.

07:04.299 --> 07:05.676
-Thank you for shopping
B. Altman.
-WOMAN: It's a little plain.

07:05.717 --> 07:07.845
Sometimes I just want
to spark it up a little.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.304
-You know?
-Mm-hmm.

07:09.346 --> 07:10.973
Yes, ma'am. What's life
without a little spark?

07:11.014 --> 07:12.391
So, what do I do?
How do I do that?

07:12.432 --> 07:14.434
-ELSA: You could go bolder
with the colors.
-Oh.

07:14.476 --> 07:16.228
-WOMAN: Like what?
-Fuchsia?

07:16.270 --> 07:17.604
-Oy.
-WOMAN: Interesting.

07:17.646 --> 07:19.940
-ELSA: Or maybe orange.
-Aah!

waiting lounge has opened up

07:24.236 --> 07:25.696
What the hell? You're in a box.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.114
Did Madame Alexander
put you in there?

07:27.156 --> 07:28.490
I'm the coat room attendant.

07:28.532 --> 07:30.868
This is my job, Susie, and
I am proud of the work I do.

07:30.909 --> 07:34.288
-Ooh.
-Yeah, seems really
soul satisfying.

07:34.329 --> 07:35.914
ANNOUNCER:
Attention, B. Altman customers,

07:35.956 --> 07:37.124
the store will be closing
in 15 minutes.

07:37.166 --> 07:38.917
What are you doing here?

07:38.959 --> 07:40.043
We have a gig tonight, remember?

07:40.085 --> 07:41.545
Yes, but we were meeting
at the club.

07:41.587 --> 07:42.754
This place is on the way.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.339
It's 20 blocks out of your way.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.550
And I like having extra time
with you before the gigs

07:46.592 --> 07:47.968
to talk, dish.

07:48.010 --> 07:49.595
Sammy Davis Jr.'s
dating a white chick.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.638
You're frog-marching me
to the gig.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.599
-That, too.
-Susie.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.184
We have a bunch
of gigs coming up

07:55.225 --> 07:56.852
and I don't like standing there
with my thumb up my ass.

07:56.894 --> 07:59.021
I'm not always late.

07:59.062 --> 08:02.357
Fine. We'll go together,
under protest

08:02.399 --> 08:05.068
because I do not appreciate this
lack of faith in my punctuality.

08:05.110 --> 08:07.404
-Viv, punch out for me.
-VIVIAN: You got it.

08:07.446 --> 08:09.406
-How may I help you?
-Not this.

08:09.448 --> 08:14.286
-This and this.
-Thanks.

08:14.328 --> 08:16.538
Not that or that.

08:16.580 --> 08:20.751
-This. This. Not that.
-Ah.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.461
Ooh, not that.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.839
-This and this. Have a good day.
-Ah.

08:28.258 --> 08:31.637
You're such a little freak.
I mean, you really are.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.597
MIDGE: I want to get serious
here for a minute, people.

08:33.639 --> 08:36.433
Nuclear war.
The nightmare, the horror.

08:36.475 --> 08:38.268
Oh, now, I'm not talking
about dying in one.

08:38.310 --> 08:40.896
I'm talking about surviving and
living in an underground bunker

08:40.938 --> 08:43.815
with your extended family
until the radiation disperses.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.859
Mr. Khrushchev,
have you met my family?

08:45.901 --> 08:48.987
If you're gonna hit us, comrade,
fucking obliterate us.

08:49.029 --> 08:52.491
I'm obsessed
with the time lady.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.868
You know her. Dial the number
and it's, "At the tone,

08:54.910 --> 08:58.497
Eastern Standard Time will be
6:53 and 20 seconds."

08:58.538 --> 09:01.500
Beep. Now, 6:53 and 30 seconds
is next, right?

09:01.541 --> 09:03.252
Maybe.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.087
But I like to think
that it may not be

09:05.128 --> 09:06.838
and then be surprised
when it is.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.508
The suspense is intoxicating.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.927
Oh, and I drink while I do this.

09:11.969 --> 09:14.012
Did I not mention that?
I should've mentioned that.

09:14.054 --> 09:17.224
My son was bullied the other day
at the park

09:17.266 --> 09:20.519
and the anger I felt
at that boy.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.146
Not the boy picking on my son,
I mean my son.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.399
You know? 'Cause Mama
didn't raise no pussies.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.734
I told him, "Get in there.
Use what you got.

09:27.776 --> 09:29.403
"The greatest defense
in the male armory:

09:29.444 --> 09:31.822
"foot to nuts. Foot to nuts.

09:31.863 --> 09:33.949
Fight dirty,
you little bastard."

09:33.991 --> 09:35.534
I got to tell you,
the first time...

09:35.575 --> 09:37.661
...my mother says,
"You've gained so much weight

09:37.703 --> 09:39.371
since the apocalypse,"

09:39.413 --> 09:42.082
I'll pry the door open and
stick my head outside, going...

09:42.124 --> 09:44.126
(breathes rapidly)
Are my eyes popping out yet?

09:44.167 --> 09:46.253
Am I bleeding from the ears?
Say that it's happening.

09:46.295 --> 09:47.754
Please tell me that
sweet release is imminent.

09:47.796 --> 09:48.755
I mean, it's the...

09:48.797 --> 09:50.424
...greatest drinking game ever.

09:50.465 --> 09:52.217
A shot of vodka every time
it goes beep.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.177
Then I throw up
on the half hour.

09:54.219 --> 09:56.305
I should patent this.
I should...

09:56.346 --> 09:58.473
...bury the body.
It's not pretty, son,

09:58.515 --> 10:00.267
but we can't leave a dead four-
year-old unburied like this.

10:00.309 --> 10:01.560
The flies, alone.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.228
Get your sand pail,
start digging.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.896
We'll make it fun.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.565
Wait. He's still breathing.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.941
He's a stubborn little fucker,
isn't he?

10:07.983 --> 10:09.568
Quick, look in my purse,
there's a...

10:09.609 --> 10:11.862
...government pamphlet I read
on this with guidelines.

10:11.903 --> 10:14.156
One was not to bring anything
into the fallout shelter

10:14.197 --> 10:16.742
that would be
unnaturally disturbing.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.493
You realize what that means.

10:18.535 --> 10:22.581
Hundreds of radioactive,
Jewish mothers above ground,

10:22.622 --> 10:25.208
roaming the streets
of the Upper West Side.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.336
If that's not a deterrent
for nuclear war,

10:27.377 --> 10:29.087
I don't know what is. I mean...

10:29.129 --> 10:30.756
...does the time lady
count off the seconds

10:30.797 --> 10:32.591
while she's having sex?

10:32.632 --> 10:34.634
Really, no man wants
to go through that.

10:34.676 --> 10:37.054
And women,
most men we sleep with,

10:37.095 --> 10:39.931
they go off before the beep.
You know what I'm saying?

10:39.973 --> 10:41.058
Then we have to...

10:41.099 --> 10:42.559
...turn ourselves in.

10:42.601 --> 10:44.102
I mean, it's one thing
to kill the boy,

10:44.144 --> 10:45.854
but taking out the rest
of his family, his mother,

10:45.896 --> 10:48.607
his sister, his dog...

10:48.648 --> 10:51.443
I think people noticed.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.653
Thanks, everybody.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.530
You've been more than diverting.

10:55.572 --> 10:58.617
I'm Mrs. Maisel. Good night.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.619
(cheers and applause)

11:00.660 --> 11:02.746
Hi. Great crowd.

11:02.788 --> 11:05.082
-Yeah, this guy in the back
wasn't laughing.
-Not one cough.

11:05.123 --> 11:06.750
It's when they don't cough
that I know I got them.

11:06.792 --> 11:08.043
I asked him if he was
foreign or something,

11:08.085 --> 11:09.461
but he's from Hoboken.

11:09.503 --> 11:10.962
Susie, 99% of the audience
was laughing.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.214
That's a good thing.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.632
You got 100% of that place
on 19th.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.175
Ah, that was a great gig.

11:15.217 --> 11:17.052
You got 100 at that
Midtown place on 23rd.

11:17.094 --> 11:18.845
23rd is not Midtown.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.430
-It's close.
-It's not close.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.015
-It's a short walk.
-It's a cab ride.

11:22.057 --> 11:23.225
Goddamn Harry Drake.

11:23.266 --> 11:24.893
He's stopping my career cold.

11:24.935 --> 11:26.645
I mean, how long
can he hold a grudge?

11:26.686 --> 11:30.273
Hey, everybody. Who here
doesn't love our Mrs. Maisel?

11:30.315 --> 11:32.275
(cheers and applause)

11:32.317 --> 11:35.904
And who here doesn't love the
dulcet tones of the autoharp?

11:35.946 --> 11:40.033
Give it up for Clint Gowdy.

11:40.075 --> 11:43.286
Hey, hey. What the hell?

11:43.328 --> 11:45.205
Jackie, how many times
have I told you?

11:45.247 --> 11:48.166
Autoharps are permanently
banned, meaning forever.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.001
Hey, as long as you're off
doing your Maisel thing,

11:50.043 --> 11:51.795
I'm gonna book
what I want to book.

11:51.837 --> 11:54.756
Autoharps, panpipes, ocarinas.

11:54.798 --> 11:56.800
-You're just toying with me now.
-That's right.

11:56.842 --> 11:58.718
And I'm gonna start charging
for overnight stays

11:58.760 --> 12:00.929
at the Hotel Le Gaslight.
Count on it.

12:00.971 --> 12:03.432
-Overnight stays?
-It's nothing. Ignore him.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.350
She's been sleeping here.

12:05.392 --> 12:08.061
I'm getting tired of having to
fold her bedding every morning.

12:08.103 --> 12:09.688
You don't sleep clean.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.314
Susie, you can't sleep here.

12:11.356 --> 12:13.024
Relax, I'm not anymore.
I swapped apartments

12:13.066 --> 12:14.776
with the Italian family
upstairs.

12:14.818 --> 12:16.486
-I'm sorry, what?
-I swapped apartments.

12:16.528 --> 12:19.448
I'm in their place
and they're in mine.

12:19.489 --> 12:22.284
A family is in your apartment?
Your place is a shithole.

12:22.325 --> 12:25.078
Oh, you'd change your tune
if you saw their place. Brutal.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.913
We really should treat
immigrants better.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.916
But what if Harry Drake's goons
show up at your apartment?

12:29.958 --> 12:31.126
-I won't be there.
-Yes,

12:31.168 --> 12:33.962
-but the Italian family will.
-I know, right?

12:34.004 --> 12:36.631
We need a more permanent
solution to this Harry thing.

12:36.673 --> 12:39.342
-One where there's
no innocent victims.
-I know.

12:39.384 --> 12:41.386
Is this your brassiere, Susie?
You left it in the back.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.180
Jesus Christ, Jackie.

12:43.221 --> 12:46.308
Well, how do you think I feel?
I thought it was a dishrag.

12:46.349 --> 12:49.186
Well, at least now I know what
to get you for your birthday.

12:53.231 --> 12:55.025
DORA: You won't be judged
by the professor's

12:55.066 --> 12:56.651
highest standard, Rose.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.528
I'm not sure I could meet
his lowest standard.

12:58.570 --> 12:59.988
Sketching, drawing, he'll say,

13:00.030 --> 13:01.615
"Let your hand follow
what your eye sees."

13:01.656 --> 13:03.450
I'll try. I practiced
a little last night,

13:03.492 --> 13:05.035
drawing a bowl of fruit.

13:05.076 --> 13:08.538
My lemon was fine,
but my banana was a disaster.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.999
It's getting the right
texture... (gasps)

13:11.041 --> 13:12.834
-You okay?
-What's the matter?

13:12.876 --> 13:15.128
-She can't breathe.
-Watch-- her chair!

13:15.170 --> 13:17.130
My God, oh, my God.

13:17.172 --> 13:19.049
Too close, too close.

13:19.090 --> 13:21.092
(hyperventilating)

13:23.553 --> 13:26.348
-That's our subject?
-That's our subject.

13:26.389 --> 13:28.350
That's our subject.

13:28.391 --> 13:31.686
That texture's gonna be
even harder to capture.

13:31.728 --> 13:34.689
(indistinct chatter)

13:34.731 --> 13:35.899
Susie!

13:35.941 --> 13:37.943
(excited chatter in Italian)

13:41.988 --> 13:43.615
Hi, everybody. How's it going?

13:43.657 --> 13:45.909
Splendido! Siamo cosi grati!

13:45.951 --> 13:47.452
Okay, quick head count.

13:47.494 --> 13:50.121
One, two, three, four
and there's little Sal.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.290
Okay. Whew, all alive.
So far, so good.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.543
Susie, ecco la tua mail.

13:54.584 --> 13:56.753
Devi essere moto importante.

13:56.795 --> 13:58.755
Ah. Grazie, Grandma.

13:58.797 --> 14:01.675
Uh, you-you might want
to keep those shades closed.

14:01.716 --> 14:03.718
(singing in Italian)

14:08.848 --> 14:10.850
(others joining in)

14:23.738 --> 14:25.740
(laughter)

14:27.200 --> 14:28.827
LANCE:
In my spare time,

14:28.868 --> 14:30.870
I've been thinking about
the very nature of infinity--

14:30.912 --> 14:32.831
w-what it infers,
what it portends.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.542
-Yes, yes.
-And for that reason,
I was wondering

14:35.584 --> 14:37.669
if you had any insight
on a true hero of mine,

14:37.711 --> 14:40.088
uh, the great German
mathematician Georg Cantor

14:40.130 --> 14:41.840
and his prodigious work,

14:41.881 --> 14:45.093
which included his theory
on the infinity of infinities.

14:45.135 --> 14:46.928
Georg Cantor.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.680
I'm really glad
you brought him up, Lance.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.181
I love that you did that.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.852
Because he reminds me of a man
that I actually do care about,

14:53.893 --> 14:56.813
and that's the great
mathematician Henri Poincaré.

14:56.855 --> 14:59.399
It's Poincaré's history
of work on the solution

14:59.441 --> 15:01.735
of the three-body problem
in planetary orbits

15:01.776 --> 15:05.405
that distinguished him,
and although he did not produce

15:05.447 --> 15:09.534
a definitive solution, he
advanced the inquiry so greatly

15:09.576 --> 15:12.203
that of course, Karl Sundman
stood on his shoulders

15:12.245 --> 15:15.707
when he finally proved
the existence of...

15:15.749 --> 15:17.917
I apologize. I need to leave
a bit early today.

15:17.959 --> 15:19.961
I'm meeting my wife
in a few minutes.

15:20.003 --> 15:23.173
An infinite series solution.

15:23.214 --> 15:28.011
Even this solution is
of limited practical utility,

15:28.053 --> 15:31.890
because it converges so slowly.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.143
Poincaré showed astounding
aptitude for mathematics

15:35.185 --> 15:38.980
at a very young age,
as all great mathematicians do.

15:39.022 --> 15:43.401
It was an innate ability that
is not uncommon in the field.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.821
He was also a man
of unusual work habits.

15:46.863 --> 15:49.199
He'd work two hours in the
morning, two in the evening

15:49.240 --> 15:51.201
and use the intervening time

15:51.242 --> 15:54.829
for his subconscious to continue
working on the problem.

15:54.871 --> 15:57.457
This calls to mind another
mathematician I discussed

15:57.499 --> 15:59.876
in my office with Truman
just last Tuesday.

15:59.918 --> 16:01.795
Truman, you took notes that day.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.254
Please share them
with the class.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.341
Stop it. Get away!
I bruise easy!

16:06.383 --> 16:08.426
ABE: If you're so inclined,
reach back further

16:08.468 --> 16:10.637
to the musings
of the mathematician Zeno.

16:10.679 --> 16:13.264
He describes
a series of paradoxes

16:13.306 --> 16:16.476
concerning infinity
and infinitesimals.

16:16.518 --> 16:18.478
This being ancient Greece,
little is left

16:18.520 --> 16:21.648
of his written record, but
of the scraps we do have left--

16:21.690 --> 16:23.066
oh, my God.

16:23.108 --> 16:24.818
-Professor Weissman?
-Are you all right?

16:24.859 --> 16:26.569
Give him air, guys.

16:26.611 --> 16:28.321
Yeah, he just saw a naked man.

16:28.363 --> 16:30.990
-I'm okay, oh, my God.
-We need crowd control here.

16:31.032 --> 16:32.659
-No, I'm okay, I'm okay.
-Are we dismissed?

16:32.701 --> 16:35.912
Yes, yes. Go. Go, go.

16:35.954 --> 16:37.664
Well, hello there, young lady.

16:37.706 --> 16:40.375
Right on time.
Uh, where shall we go?

16:40.417 --> 16:42.335
Faculty dining room,
if that's okay with you?

16:42.377 --> 16:45.171
I was just thinking about
the egg salad they make there.

16:45.213 --> 16:47.215
Ladies first.

16:54.139 --> 16:56.182
46 bucks for two months?
Is that possible?

16:56.224 --> 16:57.809
-It can't be possible.
-ED (over phone):
Your biggest charges

16:57.851 --> 16:59.936
are for multiple calls
to the same places.

16:59.978 --> 17:02.021
Midtown places.
Did you make all those calls?

17:02.063 --> 17:04.023
Well, probably, but Ed,
when I signed up,

17:04.065 --> 17:05.900
I was told
it was nine dollars a month.

17:05.942 --> 17:08.236
Yes, but you didn't take
into account the message units.

17:08.278 --> 17:10.071
-The what units?
-Well, in your plan,

17:10.113 --> 17:12.031
anything beyond two miles
of your geographical service

17:12.073 --> 17:14.576
incurs additional fees
on top of the nine dollars.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.536
You're telling me
every call beyond two miles

17:16.578 --> 17:18.496
from my apartment
is considered long distance?

17:18.538 --> 17:21.374
-Yeah, pretty much.
-So let me
get this straight, Ed.

17:21.416 --> 17:24.627
If I call someone
who's less than two miles away,

17:24.669 --> 17:26.963
and then they make a call
from a second phone

17:27.005 --> 17:28.882
to a person
four miles away from me

17:28.923 --> 17:30.759
but only two miles away
from them,

17:30.800 --> 17:33.344
and they hold the receiver
up to the line I'm on,

17:33.386 --> 17:35.305
I'll just get
charged locally, right?

17:35.346 --> 17:37.348
Sure, I mean,
if you want to go to the bother.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.892
I don't want to go
to the fucking bother, Ed.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.268
I'm just trying to figure out
how can I afford

17:40.310 --> 17:42.353
this stupid fucking phone
you sold me!

17:42.395 --> 17:43.980
Look, I hear you,
and I sympathize,

17:44.022 --> 17:45.482
but the charges are the charges.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.317
-Jesus.
-And, uh...

17:47.358 --> 17:49.068
I guess I'm compelled
to tell you this...

17:49.110 --> 17:50.862
-What?
-Our office is in Harlem,

17:50.904 --> 17:53.323
so this call
is long distance as well.

17:56.201 --> 17:58.203
-(crying)
-(speaks Italian)

18:00.789 --> 18:03.374
(knocking on door)

18:03.416 --> 18:05.376
-SHIRLEY: Joely.
-Yeah, Ma?

18:05.418 --> 18:07.378
You've got a gentleman caller.

18:07.420 --> 18:11.508
A handsome young man.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.343
Why'd you make it
sound salacious?

18:13.384 --> 18:15.178
Did-did I make it
sound salacious?

18:15.220 --> 18:16.888
Come on in, Arch.

18:18.181 --> 18:20.475
Archie, would you do me
a big favor?

18:20.517 --> 18:22.101
-Sure.
-Would you ask your brother

18:22.143 --> 18:24.062
if real estate prices
are gonna go up or down

18:24.103 --> 18:25.772
in the next ten years?
That would be a big help.

18:25.814 --> 18:27.065
I will ask him.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.942
Oh, Curry is a good man.

18:28.983 --> 18:31.820
He's a nice blend of spices
and herbs, as well.

18:31.861 --> 18:34.656
Ah. Well, I'll leave you boys
to get on with things.

18:34.697 --> 18:36.241
Your sword fights and whatnot.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.867
Thank you, Mrs. Maisel.

18:37.909 --> 18:39.494
Thanks, Ma.

18:39.536 --> 18:41.287
Smells like a foxhole in here.

18:41.329 --> 18:43.122
-Yeah, sorry.
-Can I get some coffee?

18:43.164 --> 18:44.541
Coming up.

18:44.582 --> 18:46.334
And these are...?

18:46.376 --> 18:47.752
My mother's treasure maps.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.170
Supposed to show
where they've hidden

18:49.212 --> 18:50.463
all the cash over the years.

18:50.505 --> 18:51.881
-Did Curren see these?
-You bet he did.

18:51.923 --> 18:53.174
That's what I thought.

18:53.216 --> 18:55.093
He's denying us
a line of credit.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.637
Told us there were too many
"mitigating circumstances,"

18:57.679 --> 18:59.681
which my father called
the two most goyish words

18:59.722 --> 19:00.890
in the English language.

19:00.932 --> 19:02.308
(sniffs)

19:02.350 --> 19:03.768
Smells like Ma's making kugel.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.353
She makes good kugel.

19:05.395 --> 19:07.188
Don't leave
before you have some kugel.

19:07.230 --> 19:11.860
You know, Joel, you and I
are good friends. Close.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.695
To the point where we didn't
even correct your mother

19:13.736 --> 19:15.321
when she implied that
we're a couple of queers.

19:15.363 --> 19:18.658
And because of that,
I need to say,

19:18.700 --> 19:21.286
you have got to get out
of this fucking house!

19:21.327 --> 19:23.454
Of course I have to get out
of this house!

19:23.496 --> 19:25.456
I mean, look at me.

19:25.498 --> 19:28.585
I-I'm back with my toys and my
mother and the fucking kugel

19:28.626 --> 19:30.587
and it wasn't supposed
to be like this.

19:30.628 --> 19:32.255
I've got to find a place.

19:32.297 --> 19:34.132
And it's got to be right
for the kids, too, because

19:34.173 --> 19:36.551
they have to be with me some
of the time or I'll go crazy.

19:36.593 --> 19:38.177
Good. You still got
some fight left.

19:38.219 --> 19:39.971
Now stop moving around.

19:40.013 --> 19:42.348
It's making the smell
in here worse.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.767
(sighs)

19:44.809 --> 19:50.440
I got Curren to reconsider
the mitigating circumstances.

19:50.481 --> 19:52.150
You're getting
your line of credit.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.694
-Arch. You're kidding.
-I've got things on him.

19:54.736 --> 19:56.362
And I vouched for you.

19:56.404 --> 19:58.281
And I'm gonna help you
get the hell out of here

19:58.323 --> 20:00.658
because it's just sad.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.201
I owe you, Arch.

20:02.243 --> 20:04.704
I owe you big-time.

20:04.746 --> 20:06.331
(door opens)

20:06.372 --> 20:09.709
Oops. Never mind me.
I saw nothing.

20:09.751 --> 20:11.753
(door closes)

20:15.924 --> 20:19.260
Oh. Hey, Albert, help.

20:19.302 --> 20:21.888
Ah.

20:21.930 --> 20:23.681
You're a prince, Albert.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.683
"Prince Albert."
I just came up with that.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.936
-Thank you, ma'am.
-(clears throat)

20:27.977 --> 20:29.771
Hi. Midge.

20:29.812 --> 20:33.191
-Hi.
-Midge, let me introduce you

20:33.232 --> 20:35.860
to Father O'Brien, and this
is Sister Saint Stephen.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.279
Father, Sister, this is
my good friend Midge Maisel.

20:38.321 --> 20:40.156
She's here to help me
with the reception.

20:40.198 --> 20:41.908
-Nice to meet you.
-And nice to meet you, miss.

20:41.950 --> 20:43.952
(girl crying)

20:45.411 --> 20:48.831
Carrie Ann misbehaved
in geography class.

20:48.873 --> 20:52.251
Yes. Of course.

20:52.293 --> 20:54.253
Will you excuse us
for just a second?

20:54.295 --> 20:56.881
I've got some important business
to discuss with Mary here.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.883
(whispering): What is this?
What is happening?

20:58.925 --> 21:01.219
This is my parish. I'm getting
married in the church upstairs.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.845
It's very old, very beautiful.

21:02.887 --> 21:04.764
Sure, sure,
but where are we now?

21:04.806 --> 21:06.641
This is where
the reception's going to be.

21:06.683 --> 21:08.101
-In this room?
-Yes.

21:08.142 --> 21:09.978
-No. No. No.
-Yes. Yes.

21:10.019 --> 21:11.187
Mary, there's no light here.

21:11.229 --> 21:12.855
It's damp and lifeless.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.190
And there's a little girl
crying in the corner.

21:14.232 --> 21:15.817
This is the Punishment Room.

21:15.858 --> 21:17.276
You can't have your reception
in the Punishment Room.

21:17.318 --> 21:18.861
-Midge.
-The walls
are stained with tears.

21:18.903 --> 21:20.321
My sister had
her reception here.

21:20.363 --> 21:22.365
-And how happy is your sister?
-Well...

21:22.407 --> 21:24.492
Because she got married
in the Punishment Room.

21:24.534 --> 21:27.495
-Is everything okay?
-Yes, ma'am. Sir. Sister.

21:27.537 --> 21:29.998
There is a bigger room that
you go through to get here.

21:30.039 --> 21:31.207
It has a window.

21:31.249 --> 21:32.417
That's the Window Room.

21:32.458 --> 21:33.626
That's really what they call it?

21:33.668 --> 21:34.836
The bigger donors get that room.

21:34.877 --> 21:36.129
My family's not a big donor.

21:36.170 --> 21:37.463
Ah. So it's about money.

21:37.505 --> 21:39.382
Bartering. I can work with that.

21:39.424 --> 21:41.217
-Now who's the power here,
the priest or the nun?
-Midge.

21:41.259 --> 21:42.552
-Mary.
-The priest.

21:44.595 --> 21:46.764
Father, can we talk?

21:46.806 --> 21:47.932
Of course, dear.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.934
Don't we love our sweet Mary?

21:49.976 --> 21:51.436
Oh, I've known Mary
all her life.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.521
I baptized her
when she was just a week old.

21:53.563 --> 21:55.356
Ah, well, I'm Jewish.

21:55.398 --> 21:57.817
When somebody dunks us in water,
we call a lawyer.

21:57.859 --> 21:59.819
I was just wondering,
this room--

21:59.861 --> 22:02.447
would it be possible
to give it a coat of paint?

22:02.488 --> 22:03.781
Lighten it up a little?

22:03.823 --> 22:05.825
Father picked
this color himself.

22:05.867 --> 22:07.285
And it's a nice one.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.163
Yellow mustard... gas.

22:10.204 --> 22:13.291
But a sky blue would make
the room feel cheerier.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.667
This is the Punishment Room.

22:14.709 --> 22:16.919
And there's no budget to paint.

22:16.961 --> 22:19.922
Okay. Well,
do you supply flowers?

22:19.964 --> 22:22.550
A lot of colorful flowers
would really liven things up.

22:22.592 --> 22:25.053
-We have no flowers.
-There's no money for flowers.

22:25.094 --> 22:27.472
Well, you have flowers
at funerals.

22:27.513 --> 22:29.057
Anyone scheduled to die
the week before Mary's wedding?

22:29.098 --> 22:30.266
We'll take those.

22:30.308 --> 22:31.768
-Mary.
-MARY: Midge...

22:31.809 --> 22:33.227
Is Carrie Ann still
gonna be there?

22:33.269 --> 22:35.521
-Because that'll be
very distracting.
-(clears throat)

22:35.563 --> 22:38.733
Convert. Be something else.
Buddhism's nice.

22:38.775 --> 22:40.610
I have no choice.
It is going to be here,

22:40.651 --> 22:42.737
in this room,
at Our Lady Of Perpetual Sorrow.

22:42.779 --> 22:44.572
That is not the name.

22:44.614 --> 22:47.283
Midge, the ceremony's the thing,
and the church is beautiful.

22:47.325 --> 22:49.160
Down here is just
a quick breakfast,

22:49.202 --> 22:50.953
a splash of champagne
and... what?

22:50.995 --> 22:53.623
-Did you say breakfast?
-Eggs and ham.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.170
(exhales)

22:59.212 --> 23:02.048
Mary just told me about Bill.

23:02.090 --> 23:03.299
About...

23:03.341 --> 23:05.551
Well, I guess I was
the only one not to know.

23:05.593 --> 23:08.179
He's a veteran of Korea.
Right, Mary?

23:08.221 --> 23:09.764
Our brave Bill?

23:09.806 --> 23:11.474
Yes.

23:11.516 --> 23:13.309
I'd suggest we say
a prayer for him now,

23:13.351 --> 23:15.645
but your prayers and mine,
they differ.

23:15.686 --> 23:17.146
Mine would be Mi Shebeirach.

23:17.188 --> 23:18.731
Mi Shebeirach avoteinu,

23:18.773 --> 23:20.358
Avraham, Yitzchak v'Yaakov...

23:20.399 --> 23:21.651
You'd like a lot
of our stuff, Father.

23:21.692 --> 23:23.569
We've got some real barnburners.

23:23.611 --> 23:25.655
-All right.
-But I guess
what I'm wondering now is,

23:25.696 --> 23:28.157
what if you let them
have the Window Room

23:28.199 --> 23:29.617
for an early evening reception?

23:29.659 --> 23:31.786
For just a couple of hours.
Nothing fancy.

23:31.828 --> 23:33.538
Our bingo ladies are there then.

23:33.579 --> 23:34.664
You can bump them.

23:34.705 --> 23:37.291
Just for this one night?
For Mary?

23:37.333 --> 23:39.293
And Bill.

23:39.335 --> 23:41.129
Mary's Bill.

23:41.170 --> 23:45.633
-Well, we do all love Bill.
-Mm.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.470
I guess an early evening event

23:49.512 --> 23:52.014
in the Window Room
can be arranged.

23:52.056 --> 23:54.392
Wow. So generous.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.811
Thanks, Father.

23:56.853 --> 24:00.481
I'm assuming a band
is out of the question?

24:00.523 --> 24:03.401
"The sandy beach
reminded Harold of picnics,

24:03.442 --> 24:06.404
and the thought of picnics
made him hungry."

24:06.445 --> 24:09.407
And just made your mommy hungry.
(clears throat)

24:09.448 --> 24:12.952
"So he laid out
a nice simple picnic lunch."

24:12.994 --> 24:15.788
Hope he brought wine.

24:15.830 --> 24:20.293
"There was nothing but pie."
There's never anything but pie.

24:20.334 --> 24:22.837
(phone ringing)

24:25.506 --> 24:26.674
Hello?

24:26.716 --> 24:28.092
I think there may be
a bag of money hidden

24:28.134 --> 24:29.385
in your front closet.

24:29.427 --> 24:31.429
-What?
-I've been studying
Ma's treasure maps

24:31.470 --> 24:33.306
and one of them didn't
correspond to anywhere

24:33.347 --> 24:35.224
-in their house or the factory.
-Treasure maps?

24:35.266 --> 24:37.268
And now I think one of them
is your parents' house

24:37.310 --> 24:38.936
and that on one
of my parents' visits,

24:38.978 --> 24:40.813
they stashed a bag of money
in a closet.

24:40.855 --> 24:42.481
-I know, it sounds crazy.
-Not at all.

24:42.523 --> 24:44.609
Just look.
It's the one in the foyer.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.527
Holy cow.

24:46.569 --> 24:49.113
I'm at the closet.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.448
Check the back, left side.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.950
Is it just gonna be sitting
in here on the floor?

24:52.992 --> 24:55.328
JOEL: No, it's probably
in a cutout in the wall.

24:55.369 --> 24:57.079
They cut open the wall?

24:57.121 --> 24:58.623
My dad has a portable
rotary blade.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.166
This just keeps getting weirder.

25:00.208 --> 25:02.501
Be careful 'cause some
of the bags are booby-trapped.

25:02.543 --> 25:03.753
Is it gonna explode?

25:03.794 --> 25:06.214
There may be a mouse trap in it.
It's probably snapped.

25:06.255 --> 25:07.298
Unbelievable.

25:09.550 --> 25:12.803
-Oh, wait, the wall is jiggling.
-That must be it.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.473
And there's a bag.

25:19.310 --> 25:20.478
Found it.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.855
Good. I'll come by
and pick it up tomorrow.

25:22.897 --> 25:26.776
Joel, there must be
at least $2,000 here.

25:26.817 --> 25:29.362
They're crazy, Midge.
My parents are crazy.

25:29.403 --> 25:31.656
I-I know, but at least
it skipped a generation.

25:31.697 --> 25:33.366
I think that's probably
all they stashed there.

25:33.407 --> 25:35.368
They probably got nervous
about the noise the blade made.

25:35.409 --> 25:37.036
One of the hazards
of secretly using power tools

25:37.078 --> 25:38.204
in someone else's house.

25:38.246 --> 25:40.623
-Kiss the kids for me?
-Okay.

25:40.665 --> 25:41.999
-And hug them?
-Of course.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.167
And tell them
I'll always love them?

25:43.209 --> 25:44.543
Joel, are you dying?

25:44.585 --> 25:46.379
I've got to dig into Aunt
Golda's sub-basement tomorrow

25:46.420 --> 25:48.214
and there could be
a Komodo dragon guarding it.

25:48.256 --> 25:51.092
-Just get some sleep?
-I probably won't. Good night.

25:51.133 --> 25:53.761
Good night.

25:53.803 --> 25:56.264
DORA: I've never drawn
a nude man before.

25:56.305 --> 25:57.932
MILLY: I've never seen
a nude man before.

25:57.974 --> 25:59.600
Drawing a man's genitals
is not easy.

25:59.642 --> 26:00.893
Or appetizing.

26:00.935 --> 26:02.853
Did you draw a face
on his penis?

26:02.895 --> 26:04.814
-No.
-It's smiling.

26:04.855 --> 26:07.650
-I draw what I see.
-Rose, let's see yours.

26:07.692 --> 26:09.652
Oh, I completely skipped
the down-there part.

26:09.694 --> 26:11.195
It made me very uncomfortable.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.447
-Even though it was smiling?
-It's not smiling.

26:13.489 --> 26:15.408
I wouldn't submit that
for your master's thesis, Milly.

26:15.449 --> 26:17.660
A master's degree,
that sounds so important.

26:17.702 --> 26:19.662
-Are you all on that path?
-Pretty much.

26:19.704 --> 26:21.706
My, I can't even imagine.

26:21.747 --> 26:24.583
And once you have your master's,
what do you do with it?

26:24.625 --> 26:27.295
-Pardon?
-I mean, it's so audacious,
a master's.

26:27.336 --> 26:28.504
You're learning so much.

26:28.546 --> 26:30.548
What are you going to do
with all that knowledge?

26:30.589 --> 26:33.009
-What is she talking about?
-What do you do
once you graduate?

26:33.050 --> 26:35.011
There's a lot of things
we can do. Teach.

26:35.052 --> 26:39.056
-Oh, yes, teach. Where?
-Here, I guess.

26:39.098 --> 26:41.142
But none of the teachers here
are women.

26:41.183 --> 26:42.601
They all seem to be men.

26:42.643 --> 26:45.855
-I guess a lot of them are men.
-I think all of them are men.

26:45.896 --> 26:47.106
I never put that together.

26:47.148 --> 26:49.900
Some of us want to be artists.
I want to be an artist.

26:49.942 --> 26:53.321
But there are really no
lady artists, not in the States.

26:53.362 --> 26:56.115
I knew a couple
back in the day in Paris.

26:56.157 --> 26:58.492
One quit, no one knows
where she is today.

26:58.534 --> 27:00.119
The other one killed herself.

27:00.161 --> 27:02.163
Mainly because no one
would buy art from a girl.

27:02.204 --> 27:03.998
She tried calling herself
Bertrum and wearing a bowler,

27:04.040 --> 27:05.291
but it didn't work.

27:06.334 --> 27:07.418
You don't like your sandwich?

27:07.460 --> 27:08.836
I'm not hungry anymore.

27:08.878 --> 27:10.963
Some of you are doing this
to find a husband, I assume?

27:11.005 --> 27:12.673
That's why my daughter
went to college.

27:12.715 --> 27:15.217
Oh, sure, she wanted to make
friends and take classes,

27:15.259 --> 27:18.596
but her real goal was to meet
a man, and she met one.

27:18.637 --> 27:21.098
Then he dumped her,
so she's working a low-level job

27:21.140 --> 27:23.142
because all she had was a degree
in Russian literature,

27:23.184 --> 27:24.435
but not a master's.

27:24.477 --> 27:27.480
I mean, it would be nice
to meet a man.

27:27.521 --> 27:28.856
Yeah, I guess.

27:28.898 --> 27:32.068
Well, if you want to meet a man,
this is not the place to do it.

27:32.109 --> 27:37.031
The art department, mm-mm.
The whole building, nope.

27:37.073 --> 27:38.908
Now, the business school,
that's the place.

27:38.949 --> 27:40.826
Lots of choices and they're
all studying something

27:40.868 --> 27:44.330
with real potential.

27:44.372 --> 27:46.999
I hope you don't mind
the thoughts of an older woman.

27:47.041 --> 27:48.834
I'm just very new at all this.

27:48.876 --> 27:50.920
Not at all.

27:50.961 --> 27:52.963
Yes, thank you, Rose.

27:57.134 --> 27:59.887
SUSIE: Mmm. This place has
the best pastrami, right?

27:59.929 --> 28:01.806
-See you, Susie.
-Yeah, see you, Louie.

28:01.847 --> 28:03.474
I don't know,
Katz's is pretty good.

28:03.516 --> 28:05.559
Mm, I like Katz's
for their corned beef.

28:05.601 --> 28:08.604
-Hey, Susie, call me tomorrow.
-Actually, Mel, can you call me?

28:08.646 --> 28:10.106
-Why?
-Just do it.

28:10.147 --> 28:12.983
-Whatever.
-Mm, Greengrass for the lox.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.485
I grew up on Barney Greengrass.

28:14.527 --> 28:16.362
Don't tell me
about Barney Greengrass.

28:16.404 --> 28:18.864
-Maybe the matzo ball soup.
-FRED: Hey, Susie.

28:18.906 --> 28:20.699
That thing you did?
That was real shitty.

28:20.741 --> 28:22.410
That's the joy
of not giving a shit, Freddy.

28:22.451 --> 28:24.078
You're just asking
for reciprocation.

28:24.120 --> 28:26.288
-I'm asking you to sit down.
-Don't tell me to sit down!

28:26.330 --> 28:28.582
-Fuck you and your reciprocation
and your two-dollar suits.
-No, no, fuck you...

28:28.624 --> 28:30.418
-You throw your weight around.
-And fuck your mother
at the same time.

28:30.459 --> 28:32.128
-You're nothing.
You're a nobody.
-Just crawl back up her pussy

28:32.169 --> 28:34.296
-and shut the fuck up.
-Eat shit and die!

28:34.338 --> 28:35.881
Nice guy,
I'll introduce you later.

28:35.923 --> 28:38.717
He seemed very personable.

28:38.759 --> 28:40.511
-Shit.
-What?

28:40.553 --> 28:42.263
You're not gonna believe
who else is here.

28:42.304 --> 28:43.639
-Who? Who?
-Harry Drake.

28:43.681 --> 28:45.558
-SUSIE: Harry Drake.
-MIDGE: Did he see us?

28:45.599 --> 28:47.017
He sees us now.

28:47.059 --> 28:49.103
He's coming over.
Should I scream?

28:49.145 --> 28:51.313
-Why, are you having an orgasm?
-He threatened you, Susie.

28:51.355 --> 28:54.442
-Hello, Midge, Susie.
-Hey, Harry, nice to see you.

28:54.483 --> 28:55.860
How're you liking this weather?

28:55.901 --> 28:57.570
"Spring is sprung,
the grass is riz..."

28:57.611 --> 28:59.029
"I wonder where
the birdie is..."

28:59.071 --> 29:00.948
Not that any of us
get outside much.

29:00.990 --> 29:03.242
-Just enough to hop in a taxi.
-Lunch sometime?

29:03.284 --> 29:04.660
-Name the day.
-My treat.

29:04.702 --> 29:05.703
Yup. See you.

29:05.744 --> 29:08.622
-What the fuck?
-What?

29:08.664 --> 29:10.875
When did you make up
with Harry Drake?

29:10.916 --> 29:12.001
I didn't.

29:12.042 --> 29:14.003
-Then what was that?
-That was showbiz.

29:14.044 --> 29:16.088
He's been threatening you
with violence.

29:16.130 --> 29:18.048
That's showbiz, too.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.509
Oh, look who Harry's with now.
That's Billy Jay.

29:20.551 --> 29:21.969
He books the Upstairs
at the Downstairs.

29:22.011 --> 29:23.596
I'd give my right nut
to get you in there.

29:23.637 --> 29:25.264
Yeah, that's on 56th.

29:25.306 --> 29:27.516
That's 30 blocks
above our last one.

29:27.558 --> 29:29.977
SUSIE: Billy Jay.
He never comes in here. Crap.

29:30.019 --> 29:31.770
Go talk to him.

29:31.812 --> 29:35.065
You don't just talk
to Billy Jay, you need an in.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.734
Luckily, I got one.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.652
Yeah? What?

29:38.694 --> 29:42.323
His eye for the ladies. Hmm?
(clicks tongue)

29:42.364 --> 29:44.617
-Are you having a stroke?
-Get over there
and do your thing.

29:44.658 --> 29:46.744
-What thing?
-The guy's a dog.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.746
He'd fuck a corpse if it
was less than six hours old.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.080
Are you kidding me?

29:50.122 --> 29:52.166
I'm not gonna go over there
and make this guy think

29:52.208 --> 29:53.918
I'm gonna sleep with him
if he books me.

29:53.959 --> 29:55.836
Why not? You have those weapons.

29:55.878 --> 29:58.631
-So do you.
-No, these are self-destructive.

29:58.672 --> 29:59.798
I wouldn't do something
like that.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.217
Come on, you told me all about

30:01.258 --> 30:02.843
how you practically
slept with a priest

30:02.885 --> 30:04.720
so he'd give your friend
some pigs in a blanket

30:04.762 --> 30:06.388
for her wedding,
but you're not gonna do this?

30:06.430 --> 30:09.058
That was just sweet talk.
It happened in the moment.

30:09.099 --> 30:11.560
Oh, so you're just against
being a premeditated slut.

30:11.602 --> 30:14.063
You're fine being
a spontaneous slut.

30:14.104 --> 30:16.148
I'm not sidling up to Billy Jay.

30:16.190 --> 30:18.692
Okay. Don't.

30:18.734 --> 30:21.612
But we do have to make
some money at some point.

30:21.654 --> 30:23.572
-You understand that, right?
-Yes, I understand that.

30:23.614 --> 30:26.242
-Like, now.
-Don't worry about me, I'm fine.

30:26.283 --> 30:29.954
Oh, are you, Princess?
You hanging in there?

30:29.995 --> 30:32.873
Is life okay in your 18-room
apartment on the Upper West Side

30:32.915 --> 30:35.000
with your doorman and your maid
and your childcare

30:35.042 --> 30:36.710
and your bottomless closet?

30:36.752 --> 30:39.713
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
I found $2,000 in my closet.

30:39.755 --> 30:41.131
(quietly):
This is what I'm talking about.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.759
I'm not gonna find $2,000
in my closet.

30:43.801 --> 30:46.804
Think about my life
for a moment. I'm broke.

30:46.845 --> 30:50.140
I'm working less at the Gaslight
so I'm falling further behind.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.475
I'm begging people to call me

30:51.517 --> 30:53.310
'cause I can't afford
to call them.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.646
I am picking up half-eaten
apples out of trash cans

30:55.688 --> 30:57.731
at the Port Authority.
It's getting dire here.

30:57.773 --> 30:59.900
Then I'll pay your phone bill.
How about that?

30:59.942 --> 31:01.110
It's 46 bucks.

31:01.151 --> 31:03.904
Oh. That I would have to borrow
from my father.

31:03.946 --> 31:05.447
Yeah, from the father
that doesn't have any idea

31:05.489 --> 31:07.157
why you'd be paying
the phone bill of a friend

31:07.199 --> 31:08.826
that he's never met that you're
not even supposed to know.

31:08.867 --> 31:09.827
Great plan.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.412
You know,

31:11.453 --> 31:13.247
don't worry about me,
I'll be fine.

31:13.289 --> 31:16.250
I get it. Okay? I-I'm lucky.

31:16.292 --> 31:18.836
I have a support system,
you don't. I'm sorry.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.297
Don't be sorry.
Forget I said anything.

31:21.338 --> 31:23.257
No, Susie,
it's good for me to know.

31:23.299 --> 31:24.800
A manager doesn't go
to her client

31:24.842 --> 31:26.135
saying she's worried
about money.

31:26.176 --> 31:28.596
She goes out and she gets money.

31:28.637 --> 31:30.431
I take on the burdens.
You're the artist.

31:30.472 --> 31:31.932
-Your thing's harder.
-WAITRESS: Thank you.

31:31.974 --> 31:33.517
We're both trying
something hard.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.019
Yeah.

31:36.061 --> 31:37.521
I'm getting this.

31:37.563 --> 31:41.358
I'm not arguing.

31:41.400 --> 31:44.028
VIVIAN:
Oh, my God.

31:44.069 --> 31:45.863
I was crying my eyes out.
I couldn't believe it.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.364
And then when the priest said,

31:47.406 --> 31:49.408
"Do you take this man to be
your lawfully wedded husband?"

31:49.450 --> 31:50.618
and she said, "I do."

31:50.659 --> 31:52.202
It was a cliffhanger until then.

31:52.244 --> 31:53.662
It was so magical.

31:53.704 --> 31:55.873
-It was perfect.
-It was perfect.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.666
Oh, these flowers are beautiful.

31:57.708 --> 31:59.335
Church kept them
from a funeral last week.

31:59.376 --> 32:00.669
Some guy named Horace.

32:00.711 --> 32:02.129
He was well-liked
by those who enjoy

32:02.171 --> 32:03.339
expressing themselves florally.

32:03.380 --> 32:04.882
Let's raise a glass.

32:04.923 --> 32:08.844
Horace, you were gone too soon,
but right on time.

32:08.886 --> 32:10.846
-Here's to Horace.
-To Horace!

32:10.888 --> 32:12.598
(laughter)

32:12.640 --> 32:16.018
Oh, boy,
cheap champagne works fast.

32:16.060 --> 32:17.770
-(glass clinking)
-Excuse me, everybody.

32:17.811 --> 32:20.481
If I could just grab your
attention for a minute or so.

32:20.522 --> 32:22.566
-Yay, Daddy's gonna speak.
-Whoo-hoo!

32:22.608 --> 32:24.818
-Go, Brian!
-All right!
-More Brian!

32:24.860 --> 32:26.236
(applause)

32:26.278 --> 32:28.280
Eh, don't get
your hopes up here.

32:28.322 --> 32:29.698
(laughter)

32:29.740 --> 32:30.991
I'm not much
of a public speaker.

32:31.033 --> 32:32.743
I lay bricks,
like my father did.

32:32.785 --> 32:35.871
-A speech for me
is saying "Ouch."
-(laughter)

32:35.913 --> 32:37.915
But I just wanted
to get up here and thank you

32:37.956 --> 32:39.917
for coming to celebrate
our daughter's wedding with us.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.919
There's a lot of emotion
on a day like today,

32:41.960 --> 32:45.881
but I just wanted to say, Mary,
you're the best.

32:45.923 --> 32:47.841
I love you, sweetie.

32:47.883 --> 32:50.469
And Bill, we couldn't ask
for a better son-in-law.

32:50.511 --> 32:52.554
Here's to you both.

32:52.596 --> 32:54.139
May you be as happy
as Jean and I have been

32:54.181 --> 32:56.392
for all these 30-odd years.

32:56.433 --> 32:59.937
-To Mary and Bill.
-ALL: To Mary and Bill.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.438
So pardon the interruption.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.148
I'll let you get back
to your champagne

33:03.190 --> 33:05.776
and these fantastic appetizers.

33:05.818 --> 33:08.112
And let's all have fun.

33:08.153 --> 33:09.947
(applause)

33:09.988 --> 33:11.699
Whoo!

33:11.740 --> 33:13.534
Thank you, Daddy. I love you.

33:13.575 --> 33:17.121
And for all those enjoying
the appetizers, the flowers,

33:17.162 --> 33:19.707
this wonderful room,
it's all courtesy

33:19.748 --> 33:23.168
of my brilliant B. Altman
friend, Midge Maisel.

33:23.210 --> 33:25.295
This wouldn't
have happened without her.

33:25.337 --> 33:28.298
-Thank you, Midge.
-(applause)

33:28.340 --> 33:30.926
Oh, gosh. Thank you.

33:30.968 --> 33:32.678
I was happy to do it.

33:32.720 --> 33:35.639
Really, thank you.

33:39.643 --> 33:42.896
Now I say we raise a glass
to Mary's daddy.

33:42.938 --> 33:44.648
Didn't he do a great job, guys?

33:44.690 --> 33:46.734
Even got a couple
of solid laughs.

33:46.775 --> 33:49.153
Yeah. To Daddy. Cheers.

33:49.194 --> 33:50.529
ALL:
Cheers!

33:50.571 --> 33:52.197
MIDGE: That was a tight
one minute, Brian.

33:52.239 --> 33:54.366
-You're ready for Jack Paar.
-(laughter)

33:54.408 --> 33:55.743
Yeah, I don't know about that.

33:55.784 --> 33:58.620
And the ceremony was lovely.

33:58.662 --> 34:04.293
Mary was gorgeous,
and Bill was... sweaty.

34:04.334 --> 34:05.711
(laughter)

34:05.753 --> 34:07.379
No, no, no,
you're pretty, too, Bill.

34:07.421 --> 34:09.631
But if anyone brought
a set of towels as a gift,

34:09.673 --> 34:11.425
that would've been a good time
to hand them over.

34:12.968 --> 34:14.928
She's the funniest girl
in the world.

34:14.970 --> 34:16.555
Don't oversell me there, Viv.

34:16.597 --> 34:19.266
Hey, can you all see me okay?

34:19.308 --> 34:22.686
Oh, okay. Ah, there we go.

34:22.728 --> 34:26.273
I see a few maiden aunts,

34:26.315 --> 34:28.192
I see a few drunk uncles.

34:28.233 --> 34:30.944
And of course,
there's Father O'Brien.

34:30.986 --> 34:35.741
A good man, a pious man,
a handsome man.

34:35.783 --> 34:37.534
And whatever you heard,
people, I did not

34:37.576 --> 34:40.078
-schtup Father O'Brien.
-(people gasp)

34:40.120 --> 34:42.456
I don't think God would
look too kindly on that.

34:42.498 --> 34:46.084
The lightning bolt would be the
size of Florida, right, Father?

34:46.126 --> 34:48.378
A-And if a priest is gonna
have sex, I think God would

34:48.420 --> 34:50.380
prefer it wasn't with a Jew.

34:50.422 --> 34:54.134
That's like putting mayonnaise
on a bialy, you don't do it.

34:54.176 --> 34:57.012
Uh... okay. Um...

34:57.054 --> 35:00.015
I-I always think a lot
about sex at weddings.

35:00.057 --> 35:03.811
And it makes sense. Everyone's
dolled up, drinking booze,

35:03.852 --> 35:05.979
we're happy, we're dancing.

35:06.021 --> 35:08.857
Even Brian here's
talking about laying bricks.

35:08.899 --> 35:11.318
No amount of lubrication's
gonna help you there.

35:11.360 --> 35:12.986
Talk about "Ouch."

35:13.028 --> 35:14.279
(people gasping)

35:15.906 --> 35:19.701
And-and then
there's Mary and Bill.

35:19.743 --> 35:22.371
They are perfect together,
aren't they?

35:22.412 --> 35:24.289
And talk about
love at first sight.

35:24.331 --> 35:26.458
I mean, they met in November,
and here they are

35:26.500 --> 35:27.960
three months later,
getting hitched.

35:28.001 --> 35:31.421
What do we got here, kids?
A shotgun wedding?

35:36.301 --> 35:37.845
I am so sorry, honey.

35:37.886 --> 35:39.680
I am in shock,
I'm in absolute shock.

35:39.721 --> 35:42.224
I didn't know you were gonna
throw it to me like that.

35:42.266 --> 35:43.684
I didn't throw it to you, Midge.

35:43.725 --> 35:45.561
I thanked you for the rumaki.

35:45.602 --> 35:47.145
Guess I sort of misread
the audience.

35:47.187 --> 35:49.481
-No shit.
-Mary, we're in church.

35:49.523 --> 35:51.483
-I can't go back down there.
-HARRIET:
You have to go back down.

35:51.525 --> 35:53.318
Mary, it was a mistake,
you have to believe me.

35:53.360 --> 35:54.736
I mean, there's no way
I could possibly

35:54.778 --> 35:56.113
have known you were pregnant.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.156
I've known him
three months, Midge.

35:58.198 --> 35:59.867
Why the hell do you think
I'm getting married

35:59.908 --> 36:01.702
three months after meeting him?

36:01.743 --> 36:05.581
Wow, well, guess I didn't know
you were that big a slut.

36:05.622 --> 36:07.749
Joke. That was a joke.

36:07.791 --> 36:09.710
What happened to humor, huh?

36:09.751 --> 36:12.796
It-- this isn't a funeral, it's
the happiest day of your life.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.631
(Mary blows nose)

36:14.673 --> 36:16.133
Oh, and congratulations
on the baby.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.302
(sobbing)

36:29.021 --> 36:30.939
What are you doing here?

36:30.981 --> 36:32.357
I think I'm in trouble.

36:32.399 --> 36:33.609
What are you doing here?

36:33.650 --> 36:36.862
I got a note to come
speak to Simon.

36:38.238 --> 36:40.532
Simon, it's Abe Weissman.

36:40.574 --> 36:43.285
SIMON:
Come on in, Abe.

36:43.327 --> 36:46.079
-Thank you for coming by.
-Yes. Um,

36:46.121 --> 36:49.249
what is my wife doing
out there?

36:49.291 --> 36:51.376
This is a little
embarrassing, Abe.

36:51.418 --> 36:55.964
I mean, I've known Rose socially
for what, 20 years?

36:56.006 --> 36:58.926
(sighs)
"Unusual" is the word for it.

36:58.967 --> 37:00.719
What's unusual?
What's the issue?

37:00.761 --> 37:02.596
Well...
(sighs)

37:02.638 --> 37:04.264
Rose has been very disruptive.

37:04.306 --> 37:06.767
(chuckles):
Disruptive how?

37:06.808 --> 37:09.061
All I know is she spoke
to a group of girls

37:09.102 --> 37:10.479
at a gathering here on campus,

37:10.520 --> 37:12.898
and now half of them
want to quit,

37:12.940 --> 37:14.274
and the other half
are demanding

37:14.316 --> 37:15.734
to be transferred
to the business school.

37:15.776 --> 37:17.486
And just about all of them
were crying.

37:17.527 --> 37:19.613
Well, that must be
a coincidence.

37:19.655 --> 37:21.156
-No, I don't think so.
-(bell tolling)

37:21.198 --> 37:23.992
She's disillusioned them
about the art department.

37:24.034 --> 37:27.704
So she can no longer
audit these classes, I'm sorry.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.832
No.

37:30.874 --> 37:32.668
-No.
-Pardon me?

37:32.709 --> 37:36.505
No. Sorry, she's not stopping.

37:36.546 --> 37:38.465
-Abe...
-Simon, let me be clear.

37:38.507 --> 37:40.467
I would love her to quit.

37:40.509 --> 37:42.260
I don't like
walking into a room,

37:42.302 --> 37:45.180
and my wife is there staring
at some young guy's schlong...

37:45.222 --> 37:47.140
-Abe, your language.
-But you don't understand

37:47.182 --> 37:48.558
what we've been through.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.143
If she doesn't get
to do this,

37:50.185 --> 37:51.687
she'll go back to Paris,

37:51.728 --> 37:54.189
and Paris is chock-full
of schlongs.

37:54.231 --> 37:55.732
French schlongs.

37:55.774 --> 37:57.192
This would be very bad for me.

37:57.234 --> 37:59.569
I'm afraid this isn't
your call, Abe.

37:59.611 --> 38:00.904
Rose!

38:00.946 --> 38:02.990
-Rose...
-Abe...

38:03.031 --> 38:05.826
Will you come in here, please?

38:05.867 --> 38:09.371
Rose, these girls,
you talked to them.

38:09.413 --> 38:11.957
-What did you do?
-Nothing.

38:11.999 --> 38:13.208
We've got to clear this up.

38:13.250 --> 38:15.043
Now, tell me,
what did you say?

38:15.085 --> 38:16.503
All I did was
I asked the girls

38:16.545 --> 38:18.005
why they were getting
an education,

38:18.046 --> 38:19.756
and why they were in
this particular class.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.425
And a few of them talked
about being teachers,

38:21.466 --> 38:24.344
and I pointed out that
I didn't see any female teachers

38:24.386 --> 38:26.346
in the art department.

38:26.388 --> 38:31.560
Okay, now, see, that was...

38:31.601 --> 38:33.895
Actually, that was right.

38:33.937 --> 38:36.690
We don't have any female
art teachers here, do we?

38:36.732 --> 38:39.109
Well, I'd have to check.

38:39.151 --> 38:41.194
Exactly. So I said,
"What's the point?"

38:41.236 --> 38:43.488
Well, it does seem
a little pointless.

38:43.530 --> 38:45.282
And a few others talked
about being artists,

38:45.323 --> 38:47.826
and I pointed out that I didn't
know many female artists.

38:47.868 --> 38:50.495
I-I've known a couple.
One died.

38:50.537 --> 38:52.998
ABE:
The one in the hat. Bertrum.

38:53.040 --> 38:55.042
And the other gave up.

38:55.083 --> 38:57.002
I remember you telling me
about that.

38:57.044 --> 38:59.212
You've got to admit
that's not a good track record.

38:59.254 --> 39:00.922
Eight girls are asking
to be transferred

39:00.964 --> 39:02.549
to the business school.

39:02.591 --> 39:04.426
Yes, because there are so many
handsome men over there.

39:04.468 --> 39:07.012
Ooh, the men in the business
school are very handsome.

39:07.054 --> 39:08.472
But you understand that
we count on these ladies'

39:08.513 --> 39:10.307
tuition payments
to keep the place running.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.184
Yes, but you're just
taking their money

39:12.225 --> 39:14.770
and not giving them
anything in return.

39:14.811 --> 39:16.063
Where are they going to go?

39:16.104 --> 39:17.731
They can't all work
at B. Altman.

39:17.773 --> 39:19.900
She's right.
B. Altman, I've seen it.

39:19.941 --> 39:21.485
They already have a lot
of girls working there.

39:21.526 --> 39:23.570
You know, when I went to school,
different things

39:23.612 --> 39:24.946
were expected of women.

39:24.988 --> 39:26.490
I was just getting
their points of view

39:26.531 --> 39:28.116
on why they were doing this.

39:28.158 --> 39:30.243
-Sounds very reasonable.
-Mm-hmm.

39:30.285 --> 39:32.996
You know, basically,
I think I'm on her side.

39:33.038 --> 39:34.247
And you must be, too.

39:34.289 --> 39:36.083
We're all on the same page,
right?

39:36.124 --> 39:37.334
-Abe...
-And I don't see a reason

39:37.375 --> 39:38.668
for her not to stay.

39:38.710 --> 39:41.171
Oh, really?
That's wonderful.

39:41.213 --> 39:43.215
The only thing for me is
I don't want her looking

39:43.256 --> 39:44.633
at a naked penis ever again.

39:44.674 --> 39:46.218
Oh, I'd rather not
look at that either.

39:46.259 --> 39:49.596
I think a fig leaf could be
a very tasteful way

39:49.638 --> 39:50.889
to solve the problem.

39:50.931 --> 39:52.641
If you would pass that
along, Simon...

39:52.682 --> 39:55.227
Okay. So, basically,

39:55.268 --> 39:57.395
we're on the same side
about everything

39:57.437 --> 39:59.731
and in complete agreement, yes?

39:59.773 --> 40:01.483
Good? Are we done?

40:01.525 --> 40:03.777
Sure.

40:03.819 --> 40:05.278
Thank you.

40:05.320 --> 40:06.530
You want to get some lunch?

40:06.571 --> 40:08.949
-Faculty lounge?
-Yeah, let's do it.

40:11.284 --> 40:13.203
This has been
a very good meeting, Simon.

40:13.245 --> 40:14.538
Thank you.

40:14.579 --> 40:17.124
(door closes)

40:17.165 --> 40:18.792
I've totally lost
my societal filter.

40:18.834 --> 40:19.918
SUSIE (on phone):
Your what?

40:19.960 --> 40:21.336
I don't know how to speak

40:21.378 --> 40:23.588
in front of normal,
everyday people anymore.

40:23.630 --> 40:25.423
What, like you don't know
what to say to your neighbors?

40:25.465 --> 40:27.092
-They're not worth it.
-No, Susie,

40:27.134 --> 40:29.594
I've completely forgotten
where the fucking line is.

40:29.636 --> 40:31.930
Geez, listen to me.
I said "the fucking line."

40:31.972 --> 40:33.348
I hardly ever said
the F-word before,

40:33.390 --> 40:34.850
and now it just slides
out of my mouth.

40:34.891 --> 40:36.518
I mean, what the fuck?!

40:36.560 --> 40:38.645
You tried washing your mouth out
with fancy pink soap?

40:38.687 --> 40:40.480
-(laughter, shouting)
-What is that?

40:40.522 --> 40:42.649
-What is that noise?
-Oh, it's Luigi TV.

40:42.691 --> 40:44.359
It's what?

40:44.401 --> 40:46.194
One of the kids here,
little Luigi,

40:46.236 --> 40:48.071
stands outside the window,
puts on a little show

40:48.113 --> 40:49.739
for everyone, like he's on TV.

40:49.781 --> 40:52.701
His domestic comedy's on now.
It's pretty funny.

40:52.742 --> 40:54.953
Oh, wait, commercial break.
Go on.

40:54.995 --> 40:57.122
I mean, I spoke at my wedding,
and the worst thing I said

40:57.164 --> 40:58.582
was "shrimp in the eggrolls."

40:58.623 --> 41:00.041
Guess you had to be there.

41:00.083 --> 41:03.003
So, tonight,
the gig is at 7:00.

41:03.044 --> 41:04.254
Is it really, or is it at 8:00

41:04.296 --> 41:06.214
and you're telling me 7:00
so I'll be on time?

41:06.256 --> 41:07.716
Just be there at 7:00.

41:07.757 --> 41:10.343
Okay, I'll be there
at fucking 7:00.

41:10.385 --> 41:12.220
I just have to make
a quick stop before.

41:12.262 --> 41:14.472
Just don't get distracted
by whatever the stop is.

41:14.514 --> 41:15.807
I won't, I promise.

41:15.849 --> 41:17.142
Okay, later.

41:17.184 --> 41:20.145
(laughter)

41:20.187 --> 41:23.481
(indistinct chatter)

41:54.137 --> 41:56.723
(mutters)

41:56.765 --> 41:58.934
-MIDGE: Boo.
-Oh, God.

41:58.975 --> 42:00.352
Didn't mean to scare you.

42:00.393 --> 42:02.812
No, it's good.
You restarted my heart.

42:02.854 --> 42:04.856
I think it flat out gave up.

42:04.898 --> 42:08.151
So, am I crying,
or is that just on the inside?

42:08.193 --> 42:11.571
Mostly inside. Here.

42:11.613 --> 42:13.907
Yup, $2,000.

42:13.949 --> 42:17.702
-2,135, for the record.
-Thanks.

42:17.744 --> 42:20.205
So that's the famous
treasure map, huh?

42:20.247 --> 42:23.250
One of 'em.
It's a surreal masterpiece.

Look, we pride ourselves

45:26.141 --> 45:28.309
I know that men like
stupid girls, right?

But I thought Joel
wanted more than stupid.

45:30.478 --> 45:32.105
I thought he wanted spontaneity.

45:32.147 --> 45:34.649
