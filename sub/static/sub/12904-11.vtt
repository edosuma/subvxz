00:02.005 --> 00:03.798
Previously on "Mistresses"...

00:03.818 --> 00:07.663
We don't want your mommy
finding out what I did, do we?

00:10.144 --> 00:14.118
The IRS is investigating
my company for fraud.

00:14.153 --> 00:17.054
The Food Network had interest
in a second season of my show.

00:17.090 --> 00:18.990
Call and see if we
could work something out.

00:19.025 --> 00:21.758
- Uh, leave a message.
- Hey, Marc, it's April.

00:21.794 --> 00:24.591
I'd like to talk if you get a chance.

00:25.365 --> 00:27.298
- I can't sleep.
- They're not there.

00:27.333 --> 00:29.232
I assume you were looking for these.

00:34.306 --> 00:35.806
What's going on, Joss?

00:35.841 --> 00:37.300
You looked through my stuff?

00:37.320 --> 00:39.075
What are these?

00:39.111 --> 00:41.612
Wow. I can't believe... That's really...

00:41.647 --> 00:42.913
Frickin' looking through my stuff.

00:42.948 --> 00:44.114
Hardly think that's the point.

00:44.149 --> 00:45.982
- It's a point.
- So what are they?

00:46.018 --> 00:46.883
You know what? I don't know.

00:46.918 --> 00:48.418
- You don't know?
- No. They're not mine.

00:48.453 --> 00:49.386
Right, they're not yours.

00:49.421 --> 00:51.354
Yep, they're Stacey's.
You know, my client.

00:51.390 --> 00:52.355
What are they for?

00:52.391 --> 00:53.856
Panic? Anxiety?

00:53.892 --> 00:55.825
Right. So, why has
the label been torn off?

00:55.860 --> 00:56.459
- What?
- The label.

00:56.495 --> 00:57.427
It's clearly been torn off.

00:57.462 --> 00:59.996
Oh, because of her
overprotective, you know,

01:00.032 --> 01:02.732
father/manager, in case he finds them
so he doesn't know what they are.

01:02.767 --> 01:05.034
Well, her father spends a lot of
time in our closet, does he?

01:06.538 --> 01:08.971
Wow.

01:09.007 --> 01:10.305
I-I can't do this.

01:10.341 --> 01:11.340
W-W-What can't you do?

01:11.375 --> 01:12.421
Nothing, Harry. - Tell the truth?

01:12.441 --> 01:13.873
No. I ca... I can't do this.

01:13.909 --> 01:15.942
I can't... I can't do this.

01:15.977 --> 01:16.777
I can't do us.

01:16.812 --> 01:17.977
You know, I-I

01:18.013 --> 01:19.245
I don't think that
we should get married.

01:23.919 --> 01:25.551
Have you completely lost your mind?

01:25.586 --> 01:27.153
You don't want to, either! What are...

01:27.189 --> 01:28.454
The way things have been
going around here,

01:28.489 --> 01:29.956
I mean, we're fighting nonstop.

01:29.991 --> 01:31.925
I'm sleeping on the frickin'
couch, for God sakes.

01:31.960 --> 01:34.393
- That was your choice, Joss.
- Yeah, because it's a lot less lonely

01:34.429 --> 01:35.728
than sleeping next to a stranger.

01:35.763 --> 01:36.847
I'm the str...

01:36.867 --> 01:38.768
- Okay. Would you stop and look at me?!
- I'm looking!

01:38.788 --> 01:40.766
Joss, you're popping pills,
and you're lying to me.

01:40.802 --> 01:42.501
- I'm not lying!
- You lied about Scott.

01:42.537 --> 01:44.503
Scott told me that he was
still in love with me.

01:44.539 --> 01:46.138
Yeah. And I-I didn't
think that you needed

01:46.173 --> 01:48.073
to go through
all of those feelings again,

01:48.108 --> 01:49.809
so I lied about it, so you're welcome.

01:49.844 --> 01:52.177
It's not just the lies.
It's the things you don't say.

01:52.213 --> 01:54.112
Of course it is. Joss,
you've been so closed off to me,

01:54.148 --> 01:55.981
- so secretive since I got back...
- Oh, my God.

01:56.016 --> 01:57.816
And every time I've
tried to talk to you...

01:57.852 --> 01:59.751
- About what's going on, about what hap...
- Excuse me. Seriously, not now!

01:59.786 --> 02:01.153
- That night with Wilson...
- Harry, seriously.

02:01.188 --> 02:02.988
You run off to that cult
of 12 angry women...

02:03.023 --> 02:04.122
They're not a cult!

02:04.158 --> 02:06.124
They are a group of people
that have been there for me,

02:06.160 --> 02:07.792
which is more than I can say about you!

02:07.828 --> 02:09.193
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

02:09.229 --> 02:10.794
You abandoned me, Harry!

02:12.198 --> 02:14.366
You abandoned me
during the most vulnerable

02:14.401 --> 02:16.167
and harrowing time in my life.

02:16.202 --> 02:18.837
You got on a plane, and you
frickin' went back to Europe.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.605
I wanted to stay for the trial, Joss.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.107
I insisted on staying, but
you told me to go, remember?

02:23.142 --> 02:24.242
You told me to go.

02:24.277 --> 02:27.544
The hell did I know?
I was traumatized and confused!

02:27.580 --> 02:30.481
I mean, this... the man
who sped down the freeway

02:30.516 --> 02:32.149
to stop me from marrying Scott?

02:32.185 --> 02:34.485
That guy... He would have never
left my side for anything.

02:34.520 --> 02:37.688
But this... This guy, I don't...

02:49.081 --> 02:51.234
So, what do you think?

02:51.270 --> 02:53.069
This is the sixth outfit
you've shown me,

02:53.105 --> 02:54.538
you do realize that.

02:54.573 --> 02:56.139
You sure he's gonna be there?

02:56.174 --> 02:58.074
Marc wouldn't let Lucy down.

02:58.110 --> 03:00.643
She's been preparing for
this debate for weeks now.

03:00.678 --> 03:02.879
And regardless of
how he's feeling about me...

03:02.915 --> 03:04.343
How is he feeling about you?

03:04.363 --> 03:07.050
How the hell should I know?
He hasn't called me back.

03:07.085 --> 03:08.985
God, I hate missing him this much

03:09.021 --> 03:10.720
and not knowing what he wants.

03:10.755 --> 03:13.022
Well, he got what he wants.
He just doesn't know it yet.

03:13.057 --> 03:14.023
What do you mean?

03:14.058 --> 03:16.659
Well, he wanted you
to choose him over Marjorie,

03:16.694 --> 03:17.927
and you did that, right?

03:17.962 --> 03:19.429
- Right.
- Well, once he knows it,

03:19.464 --> 03:21.949
patching things up with him
shouldn't be that hard.

03:23.701 --> 03:26.936
Wook who's here. It's Wydia.

03:26.971 --> 03:29.204
Yes. Yes, it is!

03:29.240 --> 03:31.929
Um, all right, I'll let you go.

03:31.949 --> 03:33.175
Still not natural?

03:33.210 --> 03:34.109
Getting there.

03:34.145 --> 03:36.345
Yeah. Bye.

03:37.573 --> 03:39.848
Lyd, would you grab, uh, towels?

03:39.883 --> 03:42.952
Viv's put squash everywhere.

03:42.987 --> 03:44.186
There we go.

03:44.221 --> 03:46.087
Karen, um, um,

03:46.122 --> 03:48.289
this job isn't gonna work out
for me anymore.

03:48.325 --> 03:50.391
- What?!
- Yeah, the commute is just too long,

03:50.427 --> 03:53.895
and you know I like you and
I love Vivian, but I-I can't.

03:53.931 --> 03:57.265
W-W-W-Wait. Slow down. Just slow down.

03:58.969 --> 04:01.570
Where's all this coming from?
Is it a question of money?

04:01.605 --> 04:03.037
If the commute is a problem,

04:03.073 --> 04:04.705
we can find you an apartment nearby.

04:04.740 --> 04:07.108
What, so I can have even less of a life?

04:07.143 --> 04:08.309
Oh, Lydia.

04:08.345 --> 04:10.678
You know, I know that you and
Adam are getting more serious

04:10.713 --> 04:12.546
and you'll want me to
work more weekends.

04:12.582 --> 04:15.083
But if I'm babysitting
every Friday and Saturday night,

04:15.118 --> 04:16.951
I can't exactly go on dates and...

04:16.987 --> 04:20.387
Look, we can make this work.
We can trade weekend nights.

04:20.422 --> 04:22.089
You've been part of our lives.

04:22.124 --> 04:23.891
We couldn't stand to lose you now.

04:23.926 --> 04:26.111
Vivian would be devastated.

04:27.329 --> 04:28.996
There's banana in her ear.

04:29.031 --> 04:31.131
Oh. Devastated and deaf.

04:31.166 --> 04:33.266
See how much we need you?

04:34.637 --> 04:37.304
No one's ever said that to me before.

04:37.339 --> 04:39.046
That they needed me.

04:44.313 --> 04:48.248
When? That's great.
Thank you. Thank you.

04:48.283 --> 04:50.350
Harry, my friend.

04:50.386 --> 04:51.284
Sorry to keep you waiting.

04:51.320 --> 04:52.318
Hey.

04:52.353 --> 04:53.653
It's a gorgeous day, isn't it?

04:53.688 --> 04:55.822
Yeah, well, same as yesterday, I guess.

04:55.857 --> 04:58.958
Harry, first rule
of living in Los Angeles.

04:58.994 --> 05:01.293
Treat every sunny day as the first,

05:01.329 --> 05:03.663
or you will stop appreciating it.

05:03.698 --> 05:04.764
Yeah.

05:04.799 --> 05:06.165
- Dalia?
- Ah, listen, Jonathan,

05:06.200 --> 05:08.300
- there's something I...
- First, champagne.

05:08.336 --> 05:11.137
Thank you.

05:11.172 --> 05:13.426
- What?
- The audit is over.

05:13.446 --> 05:16.442
The IRS... off my back.

05:16.477 --> 05:18.844
Didn't I tell you to trust me?

05:18.879 --> 05:21.180
- Cheers!
- Wow, Jonathan,

05:21.215 --> 05:23.349
I, uh...

05:23.384 --> 05:26.384
I'm so happy for you
that the audit is over.

05:26.420 --> 05:28.353
I really am, but, um,

05:28.388 --> 05:31.356
the Food Network has offered me
a second season of my show,

05:31.391 --> 05:32.686
and I'm gonna do it.

05:32.706 --> 05:35.326
I just thought you should hear
it from me first.

05:35.362 --> 05:37.563
Well, look, t-this audit,
it could have taken

05:37.598 --> 05:39.798
6 or 12 months,
and there were no guarantees.

05:39.833 --> 05:41.899
It's not personal, Jonathan.

05:41.935 --> 05:44.969
Look, I'm truly sorry.

05:48.908 --> 05:50.975
- Have you signed yet?
- Uh, what?

05:51.010 --> 05:53.211
The Food Network, have you
signed a contract yet?

05:53.246 --> 05:55.480
No, I haven't signed, but it's...

05:55.515 --> 05:57.315
Give me 48 hours.

05:57.350 --> 05:59.083
Let me dazzle you.

06:01.287 --> 06:02.853
I guess I could stand to be dazzled.

06:03.790 --> 06:04.889
I'm so proud of you.

06:04.924 --> 06:08.025
You kicked some major butt
in there, I mean, major butt.

06:08.061 --> 06:09.493
Please stop saying "major butt."

06:09.528 --> 06:11.696
That quote of Margaret Atwood's
you pulled out...

06:11.731 --> 06:14.364
"An eye for an eye
only leads to more blindness"

06:14.400 --> 06:16.883
- Absolutely brilliant.
- It's not like I made it up.

06:16.903 --> 06:19.203
Sweetie! Why are you not happy?

06:19.238 --> 06:21.080
Marc didn't show up.

06:21.696 --> 06:24.374
Oh, honey, that's not about you.

06:24.410 --> 06:26.009
He knew that I was gonna be here

06:26.044 --> 06:27.711
and probably just didn't want to see...

06:27.746 --> 06:29.501
Didn't want to see what?

06:29.521 --> 06:31.487
My girl wipe the floor with
those bumbling idiots up there?

06:31.523 --> 06:33.055
You made it!

06:33.090 --> 06:34.357
Yeah, of course I made it.

06:34.392 --> 06:36.592
Little late coming from rehearsal,
so I had to stand in the back,

06:36.628 --> 06:37.794
but I saw your whole thing.

06:37.829 --> 06:39.094
I'm proud of you, kiddo.

06:39.130 --> 06:40.963
Thank you.

06:40.983 --> 06:42.185
Well, I'm gonna head off.

06:42.205 --> 06:43.098
- What?!
- What?!

06:43.134 --> 06:44.967
Noel's mom was gonna take us for pizza.

06:45.002 --> 06:46.569
He asked me to be
his girlfriend yesterday,

06:46.604 --> 06:48.003
and I said yes, so it's kind of a date.

06:48.039 --> 06:49.004
See you at home?

06:49.040 --> 06:51.573
And I'll take you to dinner
soon to celebrate.

06:51.608 --> 06:53.442
The debate, not the boyfriend.

06:53.477 --> 06:55.978
Boyfriend? Did you just say boyfriend?

06:56.013 --> 06:57.980
Well, she said it first.

07:04.054 --> 07:05.754
Well, it was nice to see you, April.

07:05.789 --> 07:07.322
I kicked my mother out.

07:09.793 --> 07:13.194
- Oh.
- It became clear that she...

07:13.230 --> 07:16.033
Well, she certainly wasn't
bringing out the best in me.

07:17.234 --> 07:19.668
Look, Marc, there is so much
we should talk about.

07:19.703 --> 07:21.234
Can we grab a coffee or something?

07:21.254 --> 07:24.368
Come on, baby. We got to get back.

07:27.964 --> 07:29.177
"Baby"?

07:31.647 --> 07:33.514
We were broken up, April.

There's no candy coming out.

07:56.244 --> 07:57.804
Can I help you with something?

07:57.839 --> 07:58.872
Is Jackie here?

08:00.109 --> 08:01.474
Uh, who are you?

08:01.510 --> 08:02.876
I'm Lee Cheron.

08:02.912 --> 08:04.044
Marisol's ex.

08:08.050 --> 08:09.182
I see you made bail.

08:09.218 --> 08:11.083
Bail?

08:11.119 --> 08:14.253
No, mónita. Charges were dropped.

08:14.289 --> 08:15.488
I'm a free man.

08:15.524 --> 08:17.924
Seems the cops had nothing that'd
hold up in court, you know?

08:17.959 --> 08:19.726
- Wilson?
- Where you going?

08:23.298 --> 08:25.164
Your fist prints on her dead
body... those weren't enough?

08:25.199 --> 08:27.233
You just give Jackie
a message for me, huh?

08:27.268 --> 08:30.269
Marisol's death...

08:30.305 --> 08:31.870
is on her.

08:31.906 --> 08:34.206
You see, me and Mari...
We had a good thing going.

08:34.241 --> 08:37.809
- Uh-huh.
- Until you bitches got in her head.

08:39.212 --> 08:42.614
Marisol was a beautiful, gentle woman,

08:42.650 --> 08:44.082
and you turned her into someone else.

08:44.116 --> 08:45.183
Her fighting back?

08:45.218 --> 08:47.285
That took things to a level
it had never gone before.

08:47.321 --> 08:50.689
So if it weren't for this place...

08:50.724 --> 08:53.459
Marisol would still be alive.

08:53.494 --> 08:55.327
So you tell Jackie that.

08:56.597 --> 08:59.897
And that I'll be
seeing you girls around.

09:19.306 --> 09:20.838
You should have seen how smug he was,

09:20.873 --> 09:23.828
with his smug freakin' face,
flaunting his freedom

09:23.848 --> 09:24.947
and threatening us.

09:24.967 --> 09:26.018
What do you mean "threatening us"?

09:26.038 --> 09:27.204
Did you not hear what I just said?

09:27.240 --> 09:28.338
He blames us for Marisol's death.

09:28.374 --> 09:31.047
- That's ridiculous.
- Yeah, of course it's ridiculous.

09:31.067 --> 09:32.867
But I-it's ridiculous to a sane per...

09:32.902 --> 09:35.303
I know the guy. He's too much
of a coward to come after us.

09:35.339 --> 09:37.739
Okay, and... and the next woman
that gets in his bed...

09:37.774 --> 09:39.273
Are... are you okay with her ending up

09:39.308 --> 09:40.608
in the hospital or the morgue, Jackie?

09:40.644 --> 09:43.544
Come on, guys. If the cops aren't
gonna do anything, we have to.

09:43.579 --> 09:45.279
Right, ladies?

09:47.658 --> 09:49.884
Wow.

09:49.919 --> 09:51.878
What did you have in mind?

09:55.691 --> 09:58.091
Ooh, wow. Those look gorgeous.

09:58.127 --> 10:00.294
Oh, you think so?
Think they look gorgeous?

10:00.329 --> 10:01.395
Of course you do.

10:01.430 --> 10:04.798
Because everyone loves things
that are fresh and new.

10:04.833 --> 10:06.967
Okay, this is the part where I ask,

10:07.002 --> 10:09.136
are we still talking about the muffins?

10:09.172 --> 10:11.304
We're obviously not talking
about the muffins.

10:11.339 --> 10:13.339
We're talking about Marc
and how he could not wait

10:13.375 --> 10:15.241
five minutes after leaving our house

10:15.277 --> 10:17.243
to get together with that singer of his.

10:17.279 --> 10:19.245
Do you want to talk about it?

10:20.949 --> 10:22.282
Actually, no, I do not
want to talk about it.

10:22.317 --> 10:23.483
I don't even want to think about it.

10:23.518 --> 10:25.285
Right now, I just want to be left alone.

10:28.223 --> 10:30.056
- April?
- What?!

10:31.402 --> 10:32.781
Michael?

10:33.361 --> 10:35.328
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- That's okay, April.

10:35.363 --> 10:37.363
That wasn't aimed at you or Randy.

10:37.399 --> 10:39.332
Sorry, Randy!

10:39.367 --> 10:41.434
Ah, that wasn't
one of my finest moments.

10:41.469 --> 10:43.969
Not that I've shown you
many stellar ones, have I?

10:44.005 --> 10:45.671
That e-mail you sent was maybe one of

10:45.707 --> 10:48.207
the finest moments
in the history of fine moments.

10:49.421 --> 10:50.558
Really?

10:50.578 --> 10:52.511
Yeah. I have this habit of forgetting

10:52.546 --> 10:55.147
that not everybody's been
in transition for years.

10:55.183 --> 10:57.216
Sometimes I have to remind myself

10:57.251 --> 11:00.198
to have a little patience with friends

11:00.218 --> 11:02.187
who maybe need a chance to catch up.

11:02.223 --> 11:04.289
- Friends?
- If you'll have me.

11:09.330 --> 11:11.728
Now, what was that that I walked in on?

11:13.234 --> 11:14.833
Oh.

11:16.704 --> 11:18.469
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:18.504 --> 11:20.812
Sorry. Message from April.

11:25.178 --> 11:27.779
Oh, no! What a bastard!

11:30.917 --> 11:32.350
That was a heavy sigh.

11:32.385 --> 11:34.719
It was a sigh of relief, actually,

11:34.754 --> 11:37.321
for being in this part
of a relationship,

11:37.357 --> 11:40.991
the beautiful beginning
where everything is perfect

11:41.026 --> 11:44.228
and not at the end,
where everything is pain.

11:44.264 --> 11:45.696
Everything's perfect?

11:46.391 --> 11:48.899
- Did I say that?
- No, d-don't regret it.

11:48.934 --> 11:52.399
Hearing that gives me the courage to...

11:53.806 --> 11:55.305
do this.

11:57.442 --> 12:00.144
What did you do?

12:03.268 --> 12:05.715
- Adam, are these Onyx?
- Yep.

12:05.751 --> 12:08.285
It's my absolute favorite stone.

12:08.320 --> 12:10.205
How on earth did you know?

12:10.302 --> 12:12.519
Call it a hunch.

12:14.593 --> 12:16.459
I took... I took it too far, didn't I?

12:16.495 --> 12:17.860
Damn jewelry move.

12:20.131 --> 12:21.798
These are good tears.

12:21.833 --> 12:23.232
Good tears?

12:23.268 --> 12:26.269
I-I know I... I went out on a limb.

12:28.006 --> 12:31.307
And I want to return the gesture.

12:31.342 --> 12:33.442
Okay. Well, you know
I'm not a jewelry-wearing man.

12:35.446 --> 12:37.113
What I meant was,

12:37.148 --> 12:40.048
I think it's time I introduce
you to my friends.

12:40.083 --> 12:41.205
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

12:41.225 --> 12:43.786
I-Is this April person
one of your friends?

12:43.821 --> 12:44.853
Because when I nodded earlier,

12:44.888 --> 12:47.821
I actually had no idea
who you were talking about.

12:50.093 --> 12:51.527
God, I...

12:52.930 --> 12:54.930
I like you.

12:54.965 --> 12:57.299
I like you, too.

13:10.832 --> 13:13.677
_

13:14.684 --> 13:17.918
- That is... That's great news, um...
- Yo!

13:17.954 --> 13:21.322
The president of the
network wants to meet?

13:21.358 --> 13:25.793
Wow. That's... At their offices or...

13:25.829 --> 13:28.363
Okay, yep. Hey, listen,
and don't tell him anything

13:28.398 --> 13:29.429
about Jonathan, okay?

13:29.465 --> 13:31.298
I want to play this my way.

13:31.334 --> 13:33.000
Thank you.

13:33.035 --> 13:35.435
Wh... Did we have a surfing date
that I forgot about?

13:35.471 --> 13:37.338
No, no, I...

13:37.373 --> 13:39.639
God, I can't talk about my
girl problems without asking...

13:39.675 --> 13:41.441
Is everything okay with you and Joss?

13:41.477 --> 13:43.344
It's never a good sign when
someone's sleeping on the couch.

13:43.379 --> 13:46.613
Yeah. Things have gotten pretty dark.

13:49.418 --> 13:51.818
What do you mean "dark"?

13:51.854 --> 13:53.953
Do you know what? Is it okay
if we don't go down this...

13:53.989 --> 13:55.321
Yep, yep. Yeah, totally fine.

13:55.357 --> 13:56.890
I just, uh...

13:56.925 --> 13:58.492
I really need to stay focused.

13:58.527 --> 14:00.460
This is a crucial moment in my career.

14:00.496 --> 14:02.304
So the Food Network's happening, huh?

14:02.324 --> 14:04.364
Yeah, not unless Jonathan
makes me a better offer.

14:04.399 --> 14:06.188
Jonathan? I thought
you were done with that guy.

14:06.208 --> 14:07.941
No, listen, mate.
You get two good options

14:07.977 --> 14:09.409
on the table, you leverage
one against the other.

14:09.444 --> 14:10.276
It seems kind of risky.

14:10.312 --> 14:12.012
I don't mean to sound like a douche,

14:12.047 --> 14:13.780
but this is how it's done
in the big time, right?

14:13.816 --> 14:15.315
Mm-hmm.

14:18.053 --> 14:20.086
Wait a second. What's up
with you there, chap?

14:20.122 --> 14:22.688
You look like you mowed down a dog.

14:22.724 --> 14:25.191
A pretty messed-up thing
happened with April yesterday.

14:27.662 --> 14:30.018
She found out I slept with Sofia.

14:30.308 --> 14:34.300
You slept with Sofia? Your hot,
ex-girlfriend, singer Sofia?

14:34.336 --> 14:36.201
Mm-hmm.

14:36.237 --> 14:38.303
And I think April was trying to
patch things up with me...

14:38.339 --> 14:39.739
when she realized.

14:39.774 --> 14:41.874
- Oh, boy.
- I know.

14:41.909 --> 14:45.778
That look on her face...
Oh, God. It just killed me.

14:45.813 --> 14:47.774
But she was the one
who basically ended things.

14:47.794 --> 14:50.275
- Well, do you still love her?
- Of course.

14:53.187 --> 14:55.754
But I got to tell you,

14:55.789 --> 14:57.922
being with Sofia feels pretty nice.

14:57.958 --> 15:00.058
You know, it's free
from all the heaviness.

15:00.093 --> 15:01.426
And it's the way she looks at me,

15:01.462 --> 15:03.061
like I'm more than enough
just the way that I am.

15:03.096 --> 15:04.729
I mean, that doesn't suck, either.

15:04.765 --> 15:07.266
Mm. I bet.

15:07.301 --> 15:09.417
Give me some advice here?

15:11.304 --> 15:13.138
And if you tell me to go
"leverage one girl

15:13.173 --> 15:15.506
against the other",
we cannot be friends anymore.

15:15.542 --> 15:17.408
But that's kind of
what you're doing, isn't it?

15:17.443 --> 15:20.178
Till you make a choice.

15:20.665 --> 15:22.647
Who do you want to be with?

15:31.923 --> 15:33.392
I'm really sorry.

15:33.412 --> 15:35.211
We both are.

15:35.247 --> 15:36.713
And I know hearing this must hurt.

15:36.749 --> 15:39.416
We just can't deny
how great we are together.

15:39.452 --> 15:41.217
She and I want the same things,

15:41.253 --> 15:45.055
we're committed to this journey, and...

15:45.090 --> 15:47.623
we just feel like we can't
be held back anymore.

15:50.195 --> 15:52.929
You got one hour to get
all your crap out of my house.

15:58.303 --> 16:00.236
Well, that went well.

16:03.274 --> 16:04.754
So, where you gonna stay?

16:05.079 --> 16:07.477
You know, I don't know.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.647
Well, here's a thought... My place.

16:12.429 --> 16:13.950
What? You're really
gonna spend your money

16:13.985 --> 16:15.818
on some seedy motel near the airport?

16:15.854 --> 16:17.453
- Sofia.
- Marc.

16:17.488 --> 16:19.521
Sleep in my bed, crash on my couch.

16:20.002 --> 16:21.919
There's no pressure. I don't care.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.692
What's the worst that could happen?

16:23.727 --> 16:27.018
We find out we like
to see each other every night,

16:27.038 --> 16:29.245
every morning?

16:29.808 --> 16:31.515
Think about it.

16:41.430 --> 16:43.545
You look pretty. Where are you going?

16:43.580 --> 16:46.681
Karen is having a party to
introduce us to her boyfriend.

16:46.717 --> 16:48.383
Karen has a boyfriend.

16:48.418 --> 16:49.718
And you have a boyfriend.

16:49.753 --> 16:51.886
And Joss has a fiancé.

16:51.921 --> 16:54.555
I have a smaller house
that I bought, by the way,

16:54.590 --> 16:57.721
so a man who no longer lives in
it could feel more at home.

16:57.860 --> 16:59.827
I don't have a boyfriend anymore.

17:00.858 --> 17:02.030
What happened?

17:02.065 --> 17:03.531
Noel dumped me today.

17:03.566 --> 17:06.134
He just asked you out two days ago!

17:06.169 --> 17:08.002
What the hell is up
with these fickle-ass men?

17:08.037 --> 17:10.338
Okay. You know what? That's it.
I'm gonna cancel my plans.

17:10.373 --> 17:11.939
No, Mom, don't, really.

17:11.973 --> 17:14.381
We can order in and watch movies.

17:14.401 --> 17:16.175
I'm going to dinner with Marc.

17:17.612 --> 17:18.679
Oh.

17:18.714 --> 17:21.013
It's the one to celebrate the debate.

17:21.050 --> 17:24.284
But don't worry.
I'm gonna totally talk you up.

17:25.021 --> 17:28.188
Lucy, sit down.

17:28.223 --> 17:30.924
- Do I really have to?
- Park it.

17:36.265 --> 17:40.166
Look, I know you have hopes of me
and Marc getting back together,

17:40.201 --> 17:43.002
but you should know
that it's not happening.

17:43.037 --> 17:45.204
- Why? What'd you do?
- Me?

17:45.240 --> 17:46.706
Well, didn't you talk to him yesterday?

17:46.742 --> 17:48.241
I thought you were going to apologize.

17:48.276 --> 17:51.378
- He's seeing someone else.
- What? Already?

17:51.413 --> 17:53.380
Well, there's no way I'm going
to dinner with him now!

17:53.415 --> 17:55.515
Lucy, no, don't do that.

17:55.550 --> 17:57.350
You have your own
relationship with Marc.

17:57.385 --> 17:59.418
It's important to you,
and it's important to him.

17:59.453 --> 18:02.521
I just thought you should know
about her from me.

18:02.556 --> 18:05.358
It's not the kind of thing
you want to get blindsided by.

18:20.555 --> 18:22.608
Harry! There you are.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.410
Stu, good to see you, man.

18:25.312 --> 18:26.978
And very odd to see myself like this.

18:27.014 --> 18:28.580
My, uh, teeth are two feet tall.

18:28.616 --> 18:31.283
Well, this is a party
celebrating our family.

18:31.318 --> 18:33.285
And you were part of
that family last season,

18:33.320 --> 18:35.420
and we are very excited at the prospect

18:35.455 --> 18:36.685
of having you join us again.

18:36.705 --> 18:38.556
Well, you know, I loved
every moment of it, Stu.

18:38.591 --> 18:39.757
Ah, I'm happy to hear that.

18:39.793 --> 18:42.493
I want to tell you something.
It only gets better from here.

18:42.529 --> 18:45.897
Because this year...
Oh, perfect. There you go.

18:45.932 --> 18:47.799
- Ha. Cheers!
- Cheers.

18:47.834 --> 18:49.967
This year, it's your show.

18:50.002 --> 18:52.503
It's not Rocco's show, it's your show.

18:52.539 --> 18:55.506
And I'm giving you
the Thursday 9:00 p.m. slot.

18:55.542 --> 18:57.742
Wow, that's... that's
pretty prime real estate.

18:57.777 --> 18:59.644
You know Donatello?

18:59.679 --> 19:01.145
He's got 8:00 p.m.

19:01.180 --> 19:04.315
Now, he's got 7 million viewers,
he just signed a book deal,

19:04.350 --> 19:05.916
opened a restaurant in Las Vegas,

19:05.952 --> 19:08.285
and is ready to launch
a fleet of food trucks.

19:08.321 --> 19:10.988
And last year, he was in
the exact same position

19:11.023 --> 19:12.789
you are right now.

19:12.825 --> 19:15.759
That means that that is the future you.

19:18.164 --> 19:21.431
Uh, you know what, Stu?
I-I feel like, um...

19:21.467 --> 19:24.334
I should tell you I have other offers.

19:26.338 --> 19:28.939
Okay. Good. You know what?
You should have other offers.

19:28.974 --> 19:31.374
Yeah, I don't want to name
names, but it's... it's...

19:31.409 --> 19:32.976
You know what? I was gonna save this

19:33.011 --> 19:35.544
for after you signed the contracts,

19:35.580 --> 19:38.781
but we've been in talks with some
very heavy-hitter producers...

19:38.816 --> 19:41.750
A whole new level of stuff
for the show. Do this for me.

19:41.786 --> 19:43.686
Come by tomorrow,
hear what they have to say.

19:43.721 --> 19:47.554
If you like what they have to say,
the contracts will be ready for you.

19:49.946 --> 19:51.394
It's just so unfair.

19:51.429 --> 19:53.496
So, they just let this Lee guy go?

19:53.531 --> 19:55.163
Oh, they say the system is broken,

19:55.199 --> 19:56.899
but it's worse than that,
it's dangerous.

19:56.934 --> 19:59.201
You know, they... they kept me,
an innocent woman,

19:59.236 --> 20:00.569
in prison for months, but they let this

20:00.605 --> 20:04.220
scumbag, mouth-breathing douchebag out
just to troll the freakin' streets.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.422
Hey.

20:05.442 --> 20:06.542
Oh, sorry, Viv.

20:06.577 --> 20:07.843
- It's awful.
- It's horrible.

20:07.879 --> 20:08.943
Yeah, it's just...

20:08.979 --> 20:11.346
Just unjust. But, sweetie,
I mean, what can you do?

20:11.382 --> 20:13.748
Well, me and my Impact friends

20:13.783 --> 20:15.417
can ambush him and beat him within

20:15.452 --> 20:18.420
an inch of his life and tell him
that if he ever thinks about

20:18.455 --> 20:20.522
hurting another woman again,
we'll come back and finish the job.

20:20.557 --> 20:21.990
- Okay.
- How about that?

20:22.026 --> 20:23.191
Here we go.

20:23.227 --> 20:25.059
Honey, um...

20:25.094 --> 20:26.094
What?

20:27.898 --> 20:29.697
Oh, guys, I'm kidding.

20:29.733 --> 20:31.265
Because you know that would be crazy.

20:31.300 --> 20:32.567
- And stupid.
- And crazy.

20:32.602 --> 20:34.836
Okay, I'm just blowing
off some steam here.

20:37.106 --> 20:38.609
Are you gonna get that?

20:41.977 --> 20:43.411
Kidding!

20:43.446 --> 20:44.512
Believing.

20:44.547 --> 20:47.248
Hi, Adam.

20:47.283 --> 20:49.550
Hey, little one. How you doing?

20:50.553 --> 20:51.585
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:51.620 --> 20:52.786
This is April. Adam.

20:52.821 --> 20:55.022
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

21:00.395 --> 21:01.562
You can't even look at me?

21:01.597 --> 21:03.129
You brought your girlfriend
to my debate?

21:03.165 --> 21:05.465
She's not my girlfriend,
and I didn't bring her.

21:05.500 --> 21:08.068
In fact, I asked her
to wait in the side street,

21:08.103 --> 21:11.438
but she took it upon herself to...

21:14.009 --> 21:15.708
Anyway, let's not talk about Sofia.

21:15.743 --> 21:17.410
Can we talk about you, please?

21:17.446 --> 21:18.545
What happened with Noel?

21:18.580 --> 21:20.713
He started being weird right
after I beat him in the debate.

21:20.748 --> 21:22.115
Crushed him is more like it.

21:22.150 --> 21:25.618
And then he said I was rubbing it
in by bringing my trophy to pizza,

21:25.653 --> 21:26.953
but really I wasn't.

21:26.988 --> 21:29.489
I mean, there was no place to it.

21:29.524 --> 21:31.490
I guess I could have
left it with my mom.

21:31.525 --> 21:33.659
Whoa, hey, hey, hey.
Don't you ever do that.

21:33.695 --> 21:36.295
Don't ever apologize for your victories.

21:36.330 --> 21:39.465
And this Noel jerk... Good riddance.

21:39.500 --> 21:43.100
You should never be with someone
who tries to dim your light.

21:44.872 --> 21:46.505
Is that what my mom did?

21:46.540 --> 21:48.474
Try to dim your light?

21:48.509 --> 21:51.742
- It's complicated, Luce.
- Aren't all families complicated?

21:53.446 --> 21:56.647
Well, I thought we were a family.

21:59.685 --> 22:01.986
I'm so sorry to hear about
what happened with Marc.

22:02.021 --> 22:05.710
Oh, he was there when
I got your message.

22:05.824 --> 22:09.526
- What did I miss? What happened?
- Marc slept with the singer chick.

22:09.561 --> 22:13.225
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes. He's out with Lucy right now.

22:13.245 --> 22:14.378
Lucy's the new girlfriend?

22:14.413 --> 22:15.480
- What?
- Oh, no.

22:15.515 --> 22:18.040
- Ew!
- No, no. She's my daughter.

22:18.594 --> 22:20.017
What a sleazeball!

22:20.052 --> 22:23.287
No, no. I-It's not like that. She's 14.

22:23.930 --> 22:25.822
He's a father-figure to her.

22:25.858 --> 22:27.391
They, um, have a relationship.

22:27.426 --> 22:28.392
We don't.

22:28.427 --> 22:31.128
They do, but we, uh, don't.

22:34.690 --> 22:36.133
Oh. Oh, my God!

22:36.168 --> 22:38.068
I'm so sorry. I almost forgot dinner.

22:38.104 --> 22:40.303
You need some help
in the kitchen, doll-face?

22:40.338 --> 22:42.038
Uh, no. Thank you, babe.

22:43.074 --> 22:45.341
So, um, tell me again,
how did you two meet?

22:45.377 --> 22:46.576
- Online.
- At spin class.

22:49.280 --> 22:50.704
We didn't meet online.

22:50.724 --> 22:53.216
Well, we... we saw each
other for the first time

22:53.251 --> 22:56.085
at a spin class,
but our courtship was online.

22:56.121 --> 22:58.521
What are you talking about?

23:00.058 --> 23:03.393
What are you talking about?
Heart... HeartDuet.com.

23:03.428 --> 23:05.428
What the hell is that?

23:05.463 --> 23:09.165
Is this a joke? I found you
from your online dating profile.

23:10.096 --> 23:12.735
I don't have an online profile.

23:12.770 --> 23:14.102
Should we go?

23:14.138 --> 23:17.206
Maybe we should go.

23:17.226 --> 23:19.860
Karen, I-I got to say,
I'm not finding this very funny.

23:19.895 --> 23:21.295
Do you see me laughing?

23:21.331 --> 23:22.330
All right, that's it.

23:22.365 --> 23:24.231
- What are you doing?
- I'm pulling up your profile

23:24.266 --> 23:26.634
and our 50-some-odd correspondences.

23:30.239 --> 23:31.571
See, I'm not there.

23:31.606 --> 23:34.041
So can we stop this
weird thing you're doing?

23:34.076 --> 23:36.297
Okay, wait. Just wait a second.

23:38.806 --> 23:40.354
That's on my profile.

23:54.224 --> 23:56.993
I didn't put these up.
I didn't put any of these up.

23:57.028 --> 23:59.363
All these e-mails back and forth?

23:59.398 --> 24:01.531
How long did this go on for?

24:01.567 --> 24:03.667
I don't know, a couple of weeks.

24:05.871 --> 24:08.639
I've heard of this, um...
This thing called "catfishing,"

24:08.674 --> 24:10.774
where famous people's
accounts get hacked

24:10.794 --> 24:12.742
and used for this kind of stuff.

24:12.778 --> 24:15.121
Maybe someone who read my book?

24:15.350 --> 24:16.712
Your readers know your schedule?

24:16.748 --> 24:18.739
This person told me
to meet you at Strength Cycle.

24:22.529 --> 24:23.963
Oh, my God.

24:31.538 --> 24:34.060
Morning. I brought bagels.

24:35.542 --> 24:38.643
He's not fighting for me, Michael.

24:41.615 --> 24:43.548
No! I'm too nauseous.

24:43.584 --> 24:46.482
Hair of the dog. Come on. Chug it.

24:52.592 --> 24:53.956
Ugh!

24:55.028 --> 24:57.601
I am such a fool.

24:57.621 --> 24:59.396
Why?

24:59.432 --> 25:02.533
After I ended it with Marc,
there was a part of me

25:02.568 --> 25:04.768
that thought it was
just theater, you know?

25:04.803 --> 25:07.204
Like, I was doing something
dramatic to wake him up

25:07.240 --> 25:09.072
and then after a few days
away from me...

25:09.108 --> 25:11.008
He'd realize what he'd be losing.

25:11.043 --> 25:13.544
Well, apparently he realized
he wouldn't be losing much.

25:13.579 --> 25:15.045
And you say this pitiful thing

25:15.080 --> 25:16.580
because he slept with another...

25:16.616 --> 25:18.081
Yes! Because he slept
with another woman!

25:18.117 --> 25:19.415
So what?

25:19.451 --> 25:21.084
So what?

25:21.120 --> 25:23.353
- Are you fighting for him right now?
- No!

25:23.388 --> 25:25.455
Well, that's just sexist,
archaic, and downright weird.

25:25.490 --> 25:27.290
How is it any of those things?

25:27.325 --> 25:29.492
Because you want him back.

25:39.228 --> 25:42.474
_

25:43.941 --> 25:45.608
What?

25:45.644 --> 25:48.911
So?

25:51.515 --> 25:53.248
There is no other plan.

25:53.268 --> 25:55.161
_

25:55.181 --> 25:57.484
_

25:58.489 --> 26:00.322
No, no, no, no.

26:09.928 --> 26:12.234
I'll get him alone.

26:16.373 --> 26:18.773
"Karen Kim, 40 years old.

26:18.809 --> 26:21.577
Psychiatrist, author, mother of one.

26:21.612 --> 26:26.514
Born in Donghae, South Korea,
under a full summer moon."

26:26.549 --> 26:28.516
Creative.

26:28.551 --> 26:30.985
- I can explain.
- Get the hell out of my house.

26:31.021 --> 26:34.689
I just needed your beauty
and your accomplishments

26:34.725 --> 26:36.257
to get someone who wouldn't talk to me

26:36.292 --> 26:37.491
to actually want to talk to me.

26:37.527 --> 26:39.694
Do you realize I had sex with this man

26:39.729 --> 26:42.530
and brought him into my home,
introduced him to my daughter,

26:42.565 --> 26:44.164
all because of a comfort I felt with him

26:44.200 --> 26:45.866
that was not at all real?

26:45.901 --> 26:47.968
Do you know how violating that is?

26:48.003 --> 26:49.503
How humiliating?

26:49.539 --> 26:51.539
I'm sorry.

26:51.574 --> 26:54.208
You are so sick, is what you are.

26:54.244 --> 26:56.009
Can I at least say goodbye to Vivian?

26:56.045 --> 26:59.679
If you come within 100 feet
of my daughter ever again,

26:59.715 --> 27:01.681
and I'm calling the police.

27:01.717 --> 27:03.550
Oh, and I'd find a new career.

27:03.585 --> 27:05.457
You're not fit to work with children.

27:05.477 --> 27:07.554
I'll be letting all the agencies know.

27:20.502 --> 27:22.702
Hi, it's Jonathan. Leave a message.

27:22.738 --> 27:23.970
Hey, Jonathan. It's Harry Davis.

27:24.005 --> 27:27.641
Um, yeah, it's been two days,
and I haven't heard from you,

27:27.676 --> 27:32.812
so just checking in
before things... become final.

27:32.847 --> 27:36.482
Um, yeah, okay, then.

27:40.088 --> 27:42.588
Oh, hey. Hold on. There he is.
Harry, come on back!

27:42.623 --> 27:45.391
- Hey!
- Oh, I'm so excited to see you.

27:45.426 --> 27:48.342
I want you to meet our investors and
producers. This is Chloe DuBont.

27:48.362 --> 27:50.829
- Hello.
- And Jonathan Amadi.

27:52.163 --> 27:53.599
Hello, Harry.

27:54.486 --> 27:55.901
Jonathan.

27:55.936 --> 27:57.279
Oh, good. You guys know each other.

27:57.299 --> 27:59.738
Jonathan was just telling us
some of his new ideas.

27:59.774 --> 28:02.174
Beginning with a change in casting.

28:02.209 --> 28:03.775
I'm thinking Padma Lakshmi

28:03.811 --> 28:07.045
would be a much better choice
for this project than Harry.

28:09.028 --> 28:11.881
Uh, um, could... Jonathan,
could I speak to you?

28:11.901 --> 28:14.018
Would you excuse us, please?

28:14.053 --> 28:17.021
I promised you'd be dazzled.

28:17.056 --> 28:20.157
And unlike you, I'm a man of my word.

28:28.868 --> 28:30.567
Oh, uh, a double vodka, straight up.

28:30.602 --> 28:31.702
She'll have a lite beer.

28:36.342 --> 28:37.574
Are you sure you want to do this?

28:37.609 --> 28:40.044
Listen to me, when I tell you,
I want you to go to the bathroom

28:40.079 --> 28:41.211
and come back in two minutes.

28:41.246 --> 28:43.613
Two minutes, do you hear me?
No more, no less.

28:49.087 --> 28:50.153
Okay, go.

28:59.264 --> 29:00.830
Whoa.

29:00.866 --> 29:02.732
Hola, mami.

29:02.767 --> 29:04.734
What, is she gonna
drop-kick me or something?

29:05.937 --> 29:07.904
I need to talk to you, Lee,
but I have to make it fast

29:07.939 --> 29:10.106
because if my friends find out,
they're gonna kill me.

29:10.141 --> 29:11.941
So, talk.

29:11.977 --> 29:14.109
How about a little privacy?

29:14.144 --> 29:15.511
All right.

29:25.122 --> 29:28.758
So, Lee, you know, I-I've been
thinking about what you said

29:28.793 --> 29:31.659
about Jackie messing...
Messing with Marisol.

29:31.695 --> 29:35.130
And, I don't know, I think
she messes with all of us.

29:35.165 --> 29:40.835
Like, that freakin' place,
it brainwashes people, yeah?

29:40.871 --> 29:43.171
It's like a lot of those girls,

29:43.207 --> 29:45.044
they just... They like it rough.

29:45.064 --> 29:47.275
It's like they get off on it
or something.

29:47.310 --> 29:48.175
I mean, even Marisol.

29:48.211 --> 29:50.879
She told me that it was your dominance

29:50.914 --> 29:52.013
that turned her on.

29:53.343 --> 29:56.017
You know, she...
She also told her diary.

29:58.566 --> 30:00.021
Marisol kept a diary?

30:00.056 --> 30:01.823
Yeah, I found it
in her locker at Impact.

30:01.858 --> 30:04.591
I don't know.
The cops must have missed it.

30:05.895 --> 30:07.828
But, Lee, there's...
There's some things in there

30:07.863 --> 30:10.164
that might not look good for you.

30:10.199 --> 30:12.934
Some things that could reopen a case.

30:15.338 --> 30:19.540
I ca... I can't right now,
but I have it back at my place.

30:19.575 --> 30:21.643
Will you meet me there in an hour?

30:21.663 --> 30:23.510
I'll be alone then.

30:23.546 --> 30:25.512
I think maybe you should be, too, yeah?

30:31.286 --> 30:32.820
Let's go.

30:34.580 --> 30:36.722
Hey. Are you all right?

30:36.758 --> 30:38.858
Yeah, I'm good. Let's go.

30:47.599 --> 30:49.749
All right, let's
go over this one more time.

30:49.784 --> 30:52.758
When Lee's car arrives,
we all just stay in the van.

30:52.778 --> 30:54.945
Once he gets in the doorway,
that's when we'll hit him.

30:54.980 --> 30:57.447
We'll grab him, drag him into the alley,

30:57.482 --> 30:59.649
and we will put the fear of God in him.

30:59.684 --> 31:01.785
But when I say stop, we stop.

31:01.820 --> 31:02.719
You hear me?

31:02.754 --> 31:03.820
- Yep.
- Yeah.

31:03.855 --> 31:05.122
- Got it.
- Got it.

31:05.157 --> 31:06.956
Okay.

31:09.294 --> 31:12.395
You want to talk first, or should I?

31:12.431 --> 31:14.731
I got to say I'm a little freaked out.

31:15.286 --> 31:17.600
I fell in love with you over e-mail.

31:17.636 --> 31:19.302
But it was Lydia writing for you,

31:19.337 --> 31:21.738
or for herself, I don't know.

31:21.773 --> 31:23.672
The whole thing is... It's just weird.

31:24.126 --> 31:26.675
Well, how do you think I feel?

31:27.216 --> 31:30.679
I'm walking around thinking,
"God, this guy really gets me."

31:30.714 --> 31:32.481
Intuitively, he gets me.

31:32.516 --> 31:37.019
"And sees me in ways
I wasn't even trying to show."

31:37.055 --> 31:40.823
But you didn't see me.
You saw a cheat sheet.

31:40.858 --> 31:43.712
Well, that's not 100% true.

31:45.629 --> 31:47.496
You saw me wearing my Onyx necklace

31:47.531 --> 31:49.130
in one of my profile pictures.

31:49.166 --> 31:50.999
That's how you knew I liked these.

31:51.034 --> 31:53.836
Yeah, I saw a picture, and I
gave you a thoughtful gift.

31:53.871 --> 31:56.104
I'm sorry, Adam.

31:56.139 --> 31:59.174
I just can't pretend this is real.

32:00.710 --> 32:02.177
So that's it?

32:07.304 --> 32:09.750
K-Karen.

32:15.813 --> 32:18.496
_

32:29.071 --> 32:31.438
He's showing up. He has to.

32:34.843 --> 32:36.310
Oh, that's him.

32:38.414 --> 32:40.796
All right, let Joss go first.

32:48.390 --> 32:49.756
- He's got a gun.
- Then we're done here.

32:49.791 --> 32:50.824
- We're going. That's it.
- No.

32:50.859 --> 32:52.526
Hey! What the hell do you
think you're doing, Joss?

32:52.561 --> 32:53.894
No! No, no, no, no! Let me disarm him.

32:53.929 --> 32:54.928
- I can disarm him.
- No, no, no. We're going.

32:54.963 --> 32:57.238
- You want to get shot?!
- Stop. We can do this.

32:57.258 --> 32:58.344
Let it go.

32:58.364 --> 33:00.500
- Joss, this is dangerous!
- No.

33:00.536 --> 33:01.600
Then I'm going alone.

33:01.636 --> 33:02.601
- Hey!
- Joss.

33:02.637 --> 33:04.370
- Shh!
- Joss, don't do this!

33:20.888 --> 33:23.889
Thought you were gonna stand me up.

33:23.925 --> 33:26.625
Yeah? Just keeping you on your toes.

33:28.563 --> 33:31.430
You like it rough, right?

33:34.435 --> 33:35.567
Yeah.

33:39.573 --> 33:40.939
What the hell, you frickin' bitch?!

33:40.974 --> 33:43.508
This is for Marisol, you son of a bitch!

33:44.778 --> 33:46.878
You so much as slap another woman, yeah?

33:46.913 --> 33:49.281
You scared, Lee?
Yeah, you feeling helpless, huh?

33:50.750 --> 33:51.783
- Come on!
- Aah!

33:51.818 --> 33:53.585
What are you gonna do now, huh?

33:53.620 --> 33:54.719
That's what I thought.

33:56.656 --> 33:57.822
You're gonna pay for this, you bitch.

33:57.857 --> 33:59.223
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:59.258 --> 34:00.258
Okay.

34:02.361 --> 34:03.928
Joss! Joss.

34:03.964 --> 34:05.730
Don't do this!

34:05.765 --> 34:07.065
Joss!

34:09.001 --> 34:10.001
Get off me!

34:15.475 --> 34:18.007
Oh, my God.

34:18.043 --> 34:19.610
I'm sorry.

34:19.645 --> 34:21.512
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

34:21.547 --> 34:23.147
I'm sorry.

34:41.389 --> 34:44.292
- Hi, honey.
- He didn't show.

34:44.327 --> 34:48.195
I made turducken and lit my house
on fire, and he didn't show.

34:48.230 --> 34:50.230
I can come over and commiserate.

34:50.264 --> 34:51.732
Vivian's with Alec.

34:51.766 --> 34:53.300
Thanks, but I'm exhausted.

34:53.335 --> 34:56.870
I think I'm just gonna
leave this entire mess here

34:56.905 --> 34:59.740
and drag my rejected ass to bed.

34:59.775 --> 35:00.977
Will you be okay alone?

35:00.997 --> 35:03.898
Yeah, I've got some reading
I need to finish.

35:03.933 --> 35:05.432
Love you.

35:10.742 --> 35:12.721
_

35:12.741 --> 35:14.688
_

35:25.521 --> 35:26.653
You haven't reached Adam.

35:26.688 --> 35:27.988
You might as well leave a message.

35:29.191 --> 35:32.659
Um, I-I was a jerk earlier today, Adam.

35:32.694 --> 35:34.628
I-I don't care how we met.
I don't care that

35:34.663 --> 35:36.663
you had a Wikipedia
of information about me.

35:36.698 --> 35:38.598
What I do care about is,

35:38.634 --> 35:42.435
when I was with you, I felt good.

35:42.470 --> 35:44.303
I was happy.

35:44.339 --> 35:48.808
Maybe the happiest I've ever been.

35:49.999 --> 35:53.212
If this moves you at all,
will you call me?

35:53.248 --> 35:54.980
Or come over?

35:55.016 --> 35:57.053
Just please come over.

35:57.158 --> 36:00.353
Oh, this is Karen, by the way.

36:08.551 --> 36:12.138
_

37:02.615 --> 37:05.182
This isn't the me I want to be.

37:07.220 --> 37:08.785
Me neither.

37:08.821 --> 37:10.187
No.

37:10.223 --> 37:12.523
Oh, God, me neither.

37:12.558 --> 37:14.692
Oh, God.

37:14.727 --> 37:17.027
The pills were mine.

37:17.062 --> 37:19.040
Yeah, I know.

37:20.158 --> 37:22.899
I needed them to cope, Harry,
but I'm really not coping.

37:22.935 --> 37:26.770
I shouldn't have left you, Joss.

37:26.805 --> 37:29.439
I'll never leave you again, okay?

37:31.809 --> 37:33.334
I need help.

37:34.988 --> 37:37.780
And I need to tell you...

37:37.815 --> 37:39.521
Tell me what?

37:40.752 --> 37:42.878
About that night.

37:44.900 --> 37:46.422
Okay.

37:47.925 --> 37:49.625
Oh, my God. He came.

38:01.806 --> 38:04.406
- I'm late.
- I don't care.

38:06.109 --> 38:09.244
- Can I come in?
- Oh! Of course.

38:12.890 --> 38:15.142
Uh, the food looked better earlier.

38:15.162 --> 38:17.137
I looked better, too.

38:17.313 --> 38:21.122
- April, this is... Wow.
- Marc, I really miss you.

38:21.871 --> 38:24.759
- I miss you, too.
- I'm so sorry for the way things ended.

38:25.796 --> 38:27.962
I'm sorry, too.

38:27.998 --> 38:30.131
I want you back, Marc.

38:34.861 --> 38:37.338
Look, I know things
weren't great with us,

38:37.373 --> 38:39.273
even before my mother moved in.

38:39.309 --> 38:42.376
I was judgmental and fearful,

38:42.412 --> 38:46.789
and I think I acted from that
place pretty much all the time.

38:46.809 --> 38:48.349
But the reality of losing you

38:48.384 --> 38:50.284
has made me want to be my best self.

38:50.320 --> 38:53.220
And I know that means
helping you be your best self.

38:53.255 --> 38:54.841
This isn't a good version of me?

38:54.861 --> 38:56.790
No, it's a great version.

38:56.826 --> 38:58.325
It's the version where you're

38:58.360 --> 38:59.893
courageously going after your dream,

38:59.929 --> 39:01.200
and I want to help you do that.

39:01.220 --> 39:03.663
However bumpy the road is,

39:03.699 --> 39:06.900
I am ready to tolerate the discomfort.

39:06.936 --> 39:07.767
Right.

39:07.803 --> 39:10.237
Whether it's your past with Sofia...

39:10.272 --> 39:11.987
If it's actually the past...

39:12.007 --> 39:14.820
Your lack of income,
if you have to travel,

39:14.840 --> 39:16.075
whatever it is.

39:16.110 --> 39:18.564
When those fearful
or critical voices come up,

39:18.584 --> 39:21.005
I'm going to work through them privately

39:21.040 --> 39:23.407
and keep my mouth shut.

39:23.442 --> 39:26.210
Well, first of all,
Sofia is in the past,

39:27.142 --> 39:28.545
romantically speaking.

39:29.418 --> 39:30.413
The music's going great for us,

39:30.448 --> 39:33.260
and I'm not about to ruin that
by crapping where I eat.

39:33.280 --> 39:36.920
- Sounds like a wise decision...
- And also...

39:36.955 --> 39:38.688
she isn't you.

39:41.598 --> 39:42.926
But I just don't know
if I can be with someone

39:42.961 --> 39:45.220
who has to tolerate me, April.

39:45.240 --> 39:46.896
No, no. That's...
That's not what I meant.

39:46.931 --> 39:48.697
Look, look, I don't blame you

39:48.733 --> 39:51.000
for having your fears and your needs.

39:51.036 --> 39:52.535
And they're all legitimate.

39:52.570 --> 39:53.967
But even if you don't say them out loud,

39:53.987 --> 39:55.604
don't you think I can hear them?

39:55.640 --> 39:57.873
That I can feel them between us?

39:59.710 --> 40:03.012
April, in my heart,
in my bones, I love you.

40:04.582 --> 40:06.682
But I'm a decade late
to the starting line here,

40:06.717 --> 40:11.020
and this music career is gonna
take everything I've got.

40:11.055 --> 40:13.689
And I'm gonna have my own
self-doubt to deal with,

40:13.724 --> 40:15.691
and I just can't...

40:17.994 --> 40:20.929
I just can't carry the weight
of disappointing you, too.

40:27.450 --> 40:30.038
- Maybe one day we can try...
- Yeah, maybe.

40:36.980 --> 40:40.214
I don't know, I just promised myself

40:40.249 --> 40:42.550
I'd never feel
that powerless ever again.

40:42.586 --> 40:44.652
Joss, you're not powerless.

40:44.688 --> 40:47.622
You are the strongest person I know.

40:47.657 --> 40:49.890
Or the craziest.

40:49.925 --> 40:51.024
Tonight with Lee.

40:51.060 --> 40:54.328
Listen, anyone who went through
what you went through...

40:54.363 --> 40:56.130
And, look, we're gonna
get you help, okay?

40:56.165 --> 40:57.631
And I will be there.

40:57.666 --> 40:59.967
I will be there every step of the way.

41:03.339 --> 41:04.905
You sure you still want to marry me?

41:06.675 --> 41:08.075
I never stopped wanting to.

41:10.967 --> 41:13.780
But you should probably know
what you're getting yourself into.

41:15.784 --> 41:18.952
I tanked my entire career today.

41:22.724 --> 41:24.690
That's the correct response. Thank you.

41:26.561 --> 41:27.822
Ugh.

41:31.699 --> 41:34.134
Mom, you okay?

41:35.870 --> 41:37.703
In the bath. I'll be out in a minute.

41:37.739 --> 41:39.371
No rush. Just wanted to tell you

41:39.406 --> 41:42.174
Noel apologized
and we got back together.

41:42.209 --> 41:43.542
Happy for you, sweetie!

41:45.813 --> 41:48.280
Wait. Um, how did things go
with you and Marc?

41:48.315 --> 41:51.183
Oh, not good, hon.

41:54.922 --> 41:57.316
Then I guess we'll just have to move on.
