00:02.370 --> 00:03.462
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
JUST SAY IT.
SAY WHAT IT IS.

00:03.500 --> 00:05.502
I DON'T WANNA FEEL GUILTY
ABOUT MOVING ON WITH MY LIFE.

00:05.540 --> 00:06.768
YOUR MOTHER'S NOT
A PART OF IT ANYMORE.

00:06.810 --> 00:08.277
LOOK, I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU DO, OKAY?

00:08.310 --> 00:09.641
I DON'T CARE!

00:13.790 --> 00:15.326
MOM.

00:30.290 --> 00:33.657

HENRY.

00:40.410 --> 00:42.344
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.

00:42.380 --> 00:43.813
I DON'T HAVE
A CHOICE, RAY.

00:43.850 --> 00:45.317
THINK OF THE CONSEQUENCES.

00:45.350 --> 00:47.750
WE'RE WAY PAST
CONSEQUENCES.

00:47.790 --> 00:50.395
THIS NEEDS TO END
TONIGHT.

01:03.320 --> 01:04.685
[chuckling]

01:04.720 --> 01:06.358
WHOOPS.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.753
WHOOPS.

01:07.800 --> 01:10.633
IT'S MY NEIGHBOR'S CAR.
WE WERE GONNA PUT IT BACK.

01:10.670 --> 01:11.659
IT WAS JUST A DARE.

01:11.710 --> 01:12.904
IS THERE A PROBLEM HERE,
OFFICER?

01:12.940 --> 01:15.306
YOU WANTED MY ATTENTION, SHAWN.

01:15.350 --> 01:16.339
YOU GOT IT, BUDDY.

01:16.380 --> 01:18.416
WAIT, YOU GUYS
KNOW EACH OTHER?

01:18.450 --> 01:21.419
YEAH, HE'S SORT OF
MY DAD.

01:21.460 --> 01:22.779
WHOA.

01:22.830 --> 01:24.491
I'M AFRAID
I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK

01:24.530 --> 01:26.339
FOR THAT
WORLD'S GREATEST DAD MUG BACK.

01:26.370 --> 01:27.496
YOU JUST KEEP TALKING,
SHAWN.

01:27.540 --> 01:28.507
YOU KEEP TALKING.

01:28.540 --> 01:29.507
OH, DON'T WORRY, I WILL.

01:29.540 --> 01:30.529
LIKE WHEN I READ YOU
YOUR RIGHTS.

01:30.580 --> 01:31.376
OOH, I HAVE RIGHTS.

01:31.410 --> 01:33.241
THAT'LL BE NEW AND FUN.

01:33.280 --> 01:34.417
WHAT AM I
GONNA TELL YOUR MOTHER?

01:34.450 --> 01:35.485
I DON'T KNOW.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.784
YOU THINK YOU CAN GET
AHOLD OF HER NEW PHONE NUMBER?

01:37.820 --> 01:39.856
I HOPE IT WAS WORTH IT,
SMART-ASS.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.891
THIS OFFICIALLY ENDS
YOUR CHANCE OF BEING A COP.

01:41.930 --> 01:43.261
LET'S BE HONEST.

01:43.300 --> 01:44.562
I GAVE UP
WANTING TO BE LIKE YOU

01:44.600 --> 01:45.669
A LONG TIME AGO.

01:45.710 --> 01:47.439
THAT'S IT!
SOMEBODY BOOK HIM!

01:47.480 --> 01:49.311

01:50.550 --> 01:53.713
OH, I'M SO--I'M SORRY.

01:53.760 --> 01:55.318
[laughs]
NEVER MIND, ROOKIE.

01:55.360 --> 01:56.554
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.

(Shawn)
DUDE, I'M FREAKING OUT.

02:06.480 --> 02:07.913
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.
WHAT'S WRONG?

02:07.950 --> 02:09.440
MY MOM'S HERE.

02:09.490 --> 02:10.752
SHE'S BACK IN THE COUNTRY?

02:10.790 --> 02:13.293
BACK IN THE COUNTRY?
TRY--TRY BACK IN THIS CITY.

02:13.330 --> 02:15.525
TRY DOWNSTAIRS
IN MY DAD'S KITCHEN.

02:15.570 --> 02:16.559
WHERE ARE YOU?

02:16.600 --> 02:18.409
HIDING OUT
IN MY BEDROOM.

02:18.440 --> 02:19.532
OH, MY GOD.
HOLY CRAP.

02:19.580 --> 02:22.299
I JUST FOUND AN ENTIRE,
UNOPENED BOX OF SHRINKY DINKS.

02:22.350 --> 02:24.614
YOU'RE HIDING IN YOUR BEDROOM
BECAUSE YOUR MOM CAME TO VISIT?

02:24.650 --> 02:26.015
DUDE, YOU'VE GOT PROBLEMS.

02:26.050 --> 02:27.586
ARE YOU HEARING
WHAT I'M SAYING?

02:27.620 --> 02:30.726
MY MOM IS STANDING DOWNSTAIRS
IN MY DAD'S KITCHEN,

02:30.760 --> 02:32.762
LAUGHING IT UP,
HAVING A GRAND OLD TIME.

02:32.800 --> 02:33.869
YOU DON'T THINK
THAT'S A LITTLE WEIRD?

02:33.900 --> 02:35.504
AND YOU'RE UNHAPPY SHE'S HERE.

02:35.540 --> 02:38.703
NO, I'M NOT UNHAPPY
SHE'S...HERE.

02:38.750 --> 02:41.719
I DON'T KNOW, I HAVEN'T SEEN HER
IN THREE YEARS.

02:41.750 --> 02:44.480
SHE USED TO...
TELL ME EVERYTHING.

02:44.530 --> 02:45.679
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?

02:45.730 --> 02:46.697
WORKING.

02:46.730 --> 02:47.628
FOR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT?

02:47.660 --> 02:49.469
I GUESS.
I DON'T KNOW.

02:49.500 --> 02:50.831
I HAVEN'T...FOUND OUT MUCH,

02:50.870 --> 02:53.475
BECAUSE, APPARENTLY,
IT'S 1988 IN MY HOUSE,

02:53.510 --> 02:55.501
AND NO ONE FELT THE NEED
TO TELL ME ANYTHING.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.815
BUT...I KNOW MY DAD
IS BEHIND ALL OF THIS.

03:00.360 --> 03:01.759
OH, MY GOD.

03:01.790 --> 03:04.566
DUDE, DID YOU KNOW
I HAD A FURBY?

03:04.600 --> 03:07.160
SHAWN, I HAVE
NO TIME FOR THIS.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.667
I'VE GOT MY OWN PROBLEMS.

03:08.710 --> 03:10.575
I HAVE TO GO SEE
FRANKJIM OGLETREE.

03:10.610 --> 03:11.372
FRANKJIM OGLETREE?

03:11.410 --> 03:12.968
IS THAT A PERSON
OR A HIPPOPOTAMUS?

03:13.010 --> 03:14.819
HE'S THE NEW
REGIONAL SALES MANAGER,

03:14.850 --> 03:16.613
MY IMMEDIATE BOSS,
AND A TYRANT.

03:16.660 --> 03:18.582
THEY CALL HIM
THE LITTLE PINOCHET.

03:18.630 --> 03:20.598
THAT'S TOO ABSTRACT.

03:20.630 --> 03:21.722
WHY DON'T THEY JUST
CALL HIM JERK PANTS

03:21.770 --> 03:22.794
OR SUCK MCJONES.

03:22.830 --> 03:24.559
THEY'RE M.I.T. GUYS, SHAWN.

03:24.600 --> 03:25.532
NOW GO FACE YOUR PARENTS.

03:25.570 --> 03:27.435
YOU'VE BEEN WANTING
TO SEE YOUR MOM FOREVER.

03:27.480 --> 03:29.175
AND TELL HER I'M COMING BY
FOR SOME JELL-O CAKE.

03:29.210 --> 03:30.916
HOLY--DUDE!

03:30.950 --> 03:33.657
I JUST FOUND A PRISTINE
ISSUE OF DYNAMITE MAGAZINE.

03:33.690 --> 03:35.089
SQUARE PEGS ON THE COVER.

03:35.130 --> 03:36.688
HOLD ON, I'M GONNA READ
"BUMMERS" TO YOU.

03:39.170 --> 03:41.707
THE CHEESE KNIFE
IS IN THE SAME PLACE, RIGHT?

03:41.740 --> 03:42.502
YEAH, IT'S RIGHT THERE.

03:42.540 --> 03:43.734
YOU WANT ME TO GIVE YOU
A HAND, HON?

03:43.780 --> 03:44.804
[cork pops]

03:44.840 --> 03:46.102
DID YOU JUST
CALL ME HONEY?

03:46.150 --> 03:47.640
I DID NOT.

03:47.680 --> 03:50.558
I WAS GOING TO SAY...
HUNCHBACK.

03:50.590 --> 03:52.785
OH, SHAWNY,
LOOK AT THIS.

03:52.830 --> 03:54.195
NOT ONLY DOES YOUR FATHER

03:54.230 --> 03:56.698
OWN A VERY EXPENSIVE BO'I'I'LE
OF BORDEAUX,

03:56.740 --> 03:58.230
HE HAND-MADE
LITTLE CUCUMBER SANDWICHES.

03:58.270 --> 03:59.703
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?

03:59.740 --> 04:03.039
WOW, HE IS JUST CHOCK FULL
OF SURPRISES TODAY.

04:03.080 --> 04:05.878
WHAT? I'M ALLOWED
TO EXPAND MY HORIZONS, RIGHT?

04:08.930 --> 04:10.795
AHH.

04:10.830 --> 04:12.525
I'M SO GLAD
TO SEE YOU, MOM.

04:12.570 --> 04:13.537
AWW.

04:13.570 --> 04:14.594
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN TOWN?

04:14.640 --> 04:15.937
WELL, SOME POLICE DEPARTMENTS

04:15.970 --> 04:17.107
OCCASIONALLY CALL ME UP

04:17.140 --> 04:19.005
TO COME BACK
AND DO PSYCH EVALUATIONS.

04:19.050 --> 04:21.109
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN
ABOUT THIS?

04:21.150 --> 04:22.742
NOT LONG.
I ALMOST DIDN'T DO IT.

04:22.790 --> 04:24.758
I CHANGED MY MIND
AT THE LAST SECOND.

04:24.790 --> 04:26.826
I'M DOING SANTA BARBARA P.D.,

04:26.860 --> 04:29.294
A FEW IN SAN DIEGO,
THE BAY AREA.

04:29.330 --> 04:31.798
WHEN ARE
OUR DINNER RESERVATIONS, HENRY?

04:31.840 --> 04:34.570
OH, THERE'S
DINNER PLANS TONIGHT!

04:34.610 --> 04:35.577
YOU CAN MAKE IT, RIGHT?

04:35.610 --> 04:36.679
OF COURSE HE CAN MAKE IT.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.244
OF COURSE I WILL COME.

04:38.280 --> 04:40.748
I JUST...
NEED TO CANCEL A DATE.

04:40.790 --> 04:42.018
BUT THAT IS NOT
A BIG DEAL.

04:42.060 --> 04:43.186
YOU MADE OTHER PLANS?

04:43.230 --> 04:44.697
I DIDN'T MAKE OTHER PLANS.

04:44.730 --> 04:45.822
I--I DIDN'T KNOW.

04:45.870 --> 04:47.633
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT?

04:47.670 --> 04:48.637
THAT YOU WERE COMING.

04:48.670 --> 04:51.844
HENRY, WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL HIM I WAS COMING?

04:51.880 --> 04:53.142
HE DOESN'T HAVE A PHONE.

04:53.180 --> 04:54.317
YOU DON'T HAVE A PHONE?

04:54.350 --> 04:55.317
I DO.

04:55.350 --> 04:56.351
ARE YOU HAVING
MONEY PROBLEMS?

04:56.390 --> 04:57.618
HENRY, WHY DON'T
YOU BUY HIM A PHONE?

04:57.660 --> 04:58.684
MOM, I'M FINE.

04:58.730 --> 05:00.049
I'M NOT HAVING
MONEY PROBLEMS.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.988
UH...

05:02.030 --> 05:03.258
I'M--I DROPPED MY PHONE

05:03.300 --> 05:05.700
WHILE I WAS SOLVING
A VERY IMPORTANT CRIME.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.628
IT WAS ON THE FRONT PAGE
OF THE NEWSPAPER YESTERDAY.

05:07.680 --> 05:10.148
YEAH.

05:10.180 --> 05:12.148
MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU
PRIVATELY?

05:18.300 --> 05:19.119
[sighs]

05:19.170 --> 05:21.297
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON IN THERE?

05:21.340 --> 05:22.739
I TRIED TO TELL YOU, SHAWN.

05:22.770 --> 05:24.271
ALLOW ME
TO DEMONSTRATE TRYING.

05:24.310 --> 05:26.813
"SHAWN, GUESS WHO'S COMING BACK
INTO THE COUNTRY ON FRIDAY.

05:26.850 --> 05:27.817
YOUR MOTHER."
THAT'S IT--MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

05:27.850 --> 05:29.954
LOOK, I WANTED TO CLEAR
THE AIR ON A FEW THINGS

05:29.990 --> 05:30.957
BEFORE SHE GOT HERE.

05:30.990 --> 05:32.218
CLEAR THE AIR?

05:32.260 --> 05:33.818

HAD A WINE CELLAR.

GIVE ME A BREAK.

05:39.470 --> 05:42.268
I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE
A NICE NIGHT FOR HER HERE.

05:42.310 --> 05:43.868
YOU'RE SABOTAGING ME.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.012
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

05:45.050 --> 05:46.017
I DON'T KNOW.

05:46.050 --> 05:48.189
BUT I'M GONNA
FIGURE IT OUT.

05:54.200 --> 05:56.168
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME,
MR. OGLETREE?

05:56.210 --> 05:58.872
SHUT THE DOOR, BURTON.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.988
I...WAS READING THE PAPER...

06:03.020 --> 06:03.816
YESTERDAY...

06:03.860 --> 06:06.829
AND SOMETHING
CAUGHT MY ATTENTION.

06:08.530 --> 06:10.998
HAVE TO SAY I WAS SURPRISED,

06:11.040 --> 06:14.407
CONSIDERING YOU SEEM
TO ALREADY HAVE A FULL-TIME JOB.

06:14.440 --> 06:18.171
THIS IS...JUST...

06:18.220 --> 06:19.539
SOMETHING I DO ON THE SIDE.

06:19.590 --> 06:21.421
A HOBBY, REALLY, LIKE...

06:21.460 --> 06:23.496
COLLECTING THIMBLES
OR, UM,

06:23.530 --> 06:24.827
RAISING CARRIER PIGEONS.

06:24.870 --> 06:26.098
YOU RAISE CARRIER PIGEONS?

06:26.130 --> 06:27.131
NO, NOT AT ALL.

06:27.170 --> 06:27.989
THAT'S TOTALLY LAME.

06:28.040 --> 06:30.031
I JUST SAID THAT
BECAUSE I WAS FLUSTERED.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.844
I RAISE CARRIER PIGEONS.

06:32.880 --> 06:35.041
I'M GLAD YOU SAID THAT.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.059
BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID
TO TELL YOU HOW COOL

06:37.090 --> 06:38.921
I THOUGHT
CARRIER PIGEONS ARE.

06:38.960 --> 06:41.861
FLYING AROUND AND...
CARRYING STUFF.

06:41.900 --> 06:43.390
COMING BACK.

06:43.440 --> 06:45.169
AWESOME.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.929
I HEAR THAT.

06:46.980 --> 06:49.403
ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH THE EXCLUSIVITY CLAUSE

06:49.450 --> 06:50.474
IN YOUR CONTRACT?

06:50.520 --> 06:53.614
IT MEANS WE
DON'T ALLOW SECOND JOBS.

06:53.650 --> 06:55.049
JOBS?

06:55.090 --> 06:58.025
[laughs]

06:58.060 --> 06:58.890
NO, NO.

06:58.930 --> 07:00.591
PSYCH IS MORE LIKE
COMMUNITY SERVICE.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.198
AND IT NEVER
AFFECT S MY WORK.

07:02.240 --> 07:03.935

07:07.020 --> 07:09.318
I NOTICE THAT YOU
SIGNED OUT EARLY THAT DAY.

07:09.350 --> 07:11.250

IS I SIGNED OUT.

YOU HAD A CRAZY YEAR.

07:28.320 --> 07:30.697

07:30.730 --> 07:32.618
OF PREPARING THIS FOR YOU.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.268
WHAT IS THIS?

07:36.310 --> 07:38.278
IT'S A TERMINATION NOTICE.

07:38.310 --> 07:43.043
OR...YOU COULD QUIT
YOUR OTHER JOB.

07:43.090 --> 07:44.614

08:28.140 --> 08:29.539
I USED TO DO
QUITE A FEW SESSIONS HERE.

08:29.580 --> 08:31.218
THIS IS WHERE
I MET YOUR FATHER.

08:31.250 --> 08:32.786
I KNOW.
I HEARD THE STORY.

08:32.820 --> 08:36.381
HE DID HIS EVALUATION
AFTER HE SHOT SOME DRUG DEALER.

08:36.430 --> 08:37.658
HE TOLD YOU THAT?

08:37.700 --> 08:38.598
HE TWISTED HIS ANKLE

08:38.630 --> 08:41.235
DOING SECURITY
FOR THE CINNAMON FESTIVAL.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.306
I HAD TO CLEAR HIM
FOR DUTY.

08:43.340 --> 08:44.307
[scoffs]

08:44.340 --> 08:47.548
FIGURES.
THAT'S ABOUT PAR.

08:47.580 --> 08:49.184
WHAT HAPPENED?

08:49.220 --> 08:51.620
HE SAID THE TWO OF YOU
WERE GETTING ALONG BETTER.

08:51.660 --> 08:53.355
MOM, THE LAST THING
I WANNA DO RIGHT NOW

08:53.390 --> 08:54.550
IS TALK ABOUT HENRY.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.295
OKAY, THAT'S FAIR.

08:56.330 --> 08:57.638
LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU.

08:57.670 --> 09:00.332
WHO IS THAT DATE YOU HAD
TO CANCEL ON FRIDAY?

09:00.370 --> 09:01.075
AH, IT WAS JUST
SOME GIRL I MET.

09:01.080 --> 09:04.641
SHE'S A...MUSEUM CURATOR.

09:04.680 --> 09:05.510
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL, MOM.

09:05.550 --> 09:06.778
I DOUBT IT WOULD HAVE
WORKED OUT ANYWAY.

09:06.820 --> 09:08.117
HOW MANY DATES?

09:08.160 --> 09:09.525
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
THE FIRST.
SHAWN...

09:09.560 --> 09:11.198
MOM.
COME ON, GOOSE.

09:11.230 --> 09:12.527
WHENEVER WE TALK,

09:12.570 --> 09:14.697
YOU'RE ALWAYS ABOUT
TO NOT GO ON A SECOND DATE

09:14.740 --> 09:15.559
WITH SOMEBODY NEW.

09:15.610 --> 09:17.703
I HAPPEN TO BE EXCELLENT
AT FIRST DATES.

09:17.740 --> 09:19.503
YOU KNOW WHO IS
HAVING MULTIPLE DATES?

09:19.550 --> 09:20.505
DAD.

09:20.550 --> 09:21.448
I BELIEVE HE'S
UP TO NUMBER EIGHT

09:21.480 --> 09:23.653
WITH HIS JEKYLL-AND-HYDE
ENGLISH GIRLFRIEND.

09:23.690 --> 09:25.578
YOU GUYS SHOULD
CONNECT MORE OFTEN.

09:25.630 --> 09:28.258
HE TOLD ME THEY BROKE IT OFF
A FEW WEEKS AGO.

09:28.300 --> 09:29.699
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT HIM AGAIN.

09:29.730 --> 09:30.765
YES, WE ARE.
LET'S STOP.

09:30.800 --> 09:31.869
I SHOULD LET YOU GO.

09:31.900 --> 09:33.436
MWAH.

09:33.470 --> 09:34.801
HOW MANY OF THESE
DO YOU HAVE TO DO, ANYWAY?

09:34.840 --> 09:37.741
OH...THREE UNIFORMS
AND A DETECTIVE.

09:37.780 --> 09:38.610
[door opens]

09:38.650 --> 09:40.754
OH, YOU, UH,
YOU WANNA SEE ME, CHIEF?

09:40.790 --> 09:41.950
YES.

09:41.990 --> 09:44.527
IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION,
DETECTIVE,

09:44.560 --> 09:45.390
THAT YOU'VE DISCHARGED
YOUR WEAPONS

09:45.430 --> 09:47.466
IN THE LAST FOUR CASES
YOU'VE WORKED.

09:47.500 --> 09:48.535
THANK YOU.

09:48.570 --> 09:50.379
THAT WASN'T A COMPLIMENT.

09:50.410 --> 09:52.674
I'M JUST TRYING TO KEEP
THE STREETS SAFE, CHIEF.

09:52.710 --> 09:54.644
THE LAST INCIDENT
WAS AT A CAT SHOW.

09:54.680 --> 09:56.853
WELL, LET ME JUST
GO ON RECORD AS SAYING

09:56.890 --> 09:59.552
THAT I WOULD NEVER
SHOOT A CAT.

09:59.590 --> 10:02.366
I GUESS I COULD FIND
SOME SOLACE IN THAT.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.391
UNLESS IT WAS APPROACHING
IN A THREATENING MANNER.

10:04.440 --> 10:05.702
OR REFUSED TO STOP
UPON MY COMMAND.

10:05.740 --> 10:08.231
I WOULD PROBABLY JUST FIRE
A WARNING SHOT

10:08.280 --> 10:09.247
TO MAKE MY POINT,

10:09.280 --> 10:10.508
BUT IT'S REALLY
A FIELD DECISION.

10:10.550 --> 10:12.347
I CAN'T COMMIT TO IT
AT THIS JUNCTURE.

10:12.390 --> 10:13.982
UHH.

10:14.020 --> 10:15.248
I'VE REQUESTED

10:15.290 --> 10:16.689
A DEPARTM ENT-SANCT ION ED
PSYCHOLOGIST

10:16.730 --> 10:19.790
TO COME HERE AND HAVE...
A SESSION OR TWO WITH YOU.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.732
I'M JUST...
GONNA HAVE TO SAY NO.

10:23.780 --> 10:25.429
THAT WASN'T A QUESTION.

10:25.480 --> 10:26.879
COULD YOU PHRASE IT
LIKE ONE?

10:33.800 --> 10:34.858
HEY, KATIE.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.767
CATHY. SHAWN.

10:37.800 --> 10:38.869
SHAWN?

10:39.970 --> 10:41.699
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

10:41.740 --> 10:42.877
I SHOULD ASK YOU
THE SAME QUESTION.

10:42.910 --> 10:43.808
I WORK HERE.

10:43.850 --> 10:46.387
OKAY, I SHOULD ASK YOU
A DIFFERENT QUESTION.

10:46.420 --> 10:47.717
WHY DIDN'T YOU RETURN
MY CALLS ALL WEEKEND?

10:47.760 --> 10:49.887
SHAWN, I HAD NO OTHER CHOICE
ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

10:49.930 --> 10:52.865
OH, MY GOD.
THIS ISN'T A JOKE.

10:52.900 --> 10:53.969
YOU'RE REALLY
QUITTING PSYCH?

10:54.000 --> 10:55.399
I'M SO SORRY, SHAWN.

10:55.440 --> 10:56.668
IN A TEXT MESSAGE, NO LESS?

10:56.710 --> 10:58.473
I COULDN'T THINK
OF ANY OTHER WAY TO TELL YOU.

10:58.510 --> 11:00.341
I KNEW YOU WOULD JUST TRY
TO CONVINCE ME TO STAY.

11:00.380 --> 11:02.780
LISTEN, MAYBE WE COULD
STILL DO IT ON THE WEEKENDS.

11:02.820 --> 11:03.957
IF YOU'RE READY
TO HEAR SOME GOOD NEWS,

11:03.990 --> 11:06.584
I HAVE WORKED OUT A COMPROMISE
THAT WILL SOLVE ALL OF THIS.

11:06.630 --> 11:07.699
REALLY?
YES.

11:07.730 --> 11:09.425
YOU QUIT THIS JOB.
THIS JOB YOU QUIT!

11:09.470 --> 11:10.937
WE TAKE ON EXTRA CASES

11:10.970 --> 11:11.709
TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE
IN SALARY.

11:11.740 --> 11:13.833
I MAKE 48 GRAND A YEAR,
SHAWN.

11:13.870 --> 11:15.098
WHAT IS THAT, YEN?

11:15.140 --> 11:16.949
WHO NEEDS $48,000 TO LIVE?

11:16.980 --> 11:18.379
I NEED 32.

11:18.420 --> 11:19.944
THE OTHER 16
GENERALLY GOES TO YOU.

11:19.990 --> 11:20.786
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

11:20.820 --> 11:23.459
I CLAIMED YOU
ON MY TAXES, SHAWN!

11:23.490 --> 11:24.923
HOLY CRAP.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.791
IS THIS BIANCA'S
PAPPARDELLE?

11:26.830 --> 11:28.058
MM-MMM, I FOUND IT
IN THE KITCHEN FRIDGE.

11:28.100 --> 11:29.931
OH, MY GOSH,
SHE'S GONNA GO INSANE.

11:29.970 --> 11:31.949
SHE HAND ROLLS HER PASTA
EVERY WEEKEND, SHAWN.

11:31.980 --> 11:32.742
THEY TAKE ALL DAY.

11:32.780 --> 11:34.509
SHE GRINDS HER OWN SPICES,
SHAWN.

11:34.550 --> 11:36.438
WELL, I THOUGHT
IT WAS FOR EVERYBODY.

11:36.490 --> 11:37.479
CRAP!

11:37.520 --> 11:38.748
[clattering]

11:38.790 --> 11:39.825
BURTON.

11:39.860 --> 11:40.827
BIANCA.

11:40.860 --> 11:42.088
PAUL WOULD LIKE
TO SEE YOU.

11:42.130 --> 11:43.165
MR. HAVERSHAM?

11:43.200 --> 11:44.861
REALLY? LOVELY.

11:44.900 --> 11:45.935
I'LL BE THERE IN A SECOND.

11:45.970 --> 11:47.437
OKAY.

11:52.520 --> 11:53.589
WHAT DOES SHE DO?

11:53.620 --> 11:55.850
SHE'S HAVERSHAM'S
SECRETARY.

11:55.890 --> 11:57.528
IS HAVERSHAM THE GUY
WHO TRIED TO FIRE YOU?

11:57.560 --> 11:58.697
NO, HE'S THAT GUY'S BOSS.

11:58.730 --> 12:00.220
EVERYBODY'S BOSS.
HE'S THE VP.

12:00.270 --> 12:01.430
PERFECT --HE'S THE ONE
WE HAVE TO CONVINCE

12:01.440 --> 12:02.998
TO LET YOU
KEEP DOING BOTH JOBS.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.109
I NEED A SECOND.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.801
I'M GONNA CLEAN MY TEETH
BEFORE WE GO IN.

12:05.850 --> 12:06.942
NO, NO, NO, SHAWN.

12:06.980 --> 12:08.049
YOU'RE LEAVING NOW.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.616
GUS, I'M NOT BUDGING

12:09.650 --> 12:12.153
UNTIL WE MAKE THIS NICE.

12:12.190 --> 12:13.157
ALL RIGHT.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.555
BUT YOU ASKED FOR IT.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.124
ASKED FOR WHAT?

12:16.170 --> 12:17.660
[grunting]

12:17.700 --> 12:19.167
LET GO OF ME.

12:19.210 --> 12:20.973
[grunting]

12:21.010 --> 12:23.501
DON'T YOU DARE GO BONELESS
ON ME, SHAWN!

12:23.550 --> 12:25.518
OKAY, MY BA--
OW, OW, OW!
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

12:25.550 --> 12:26.812
YOU SEE, THAT'S
WHY IT'S NOT--

12:26.860 --> 12:28.179
OW, YOU SON OF A BITCH!

12:28.220 --> 12:29.289
[grunting]

12:29.320 --> 12:31.129
AAH! UHH!

12:31.160 --> 12:34.163
[both grunting]

12:38.340 --> 12:40.808
[panﬁng]

12:40.850 --> 12:42.283
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

12:42.320 --> 12:43.787
YES, I DID.

12:43.820 --> 12:45.981
I HAVE A PROJECT FOR YOU.
HAVE A SEAT.

12:47.830 --> 12:49.559
IS THAT YOUR WIFE?
IT'S MY GRANDMOTHER.

12:49.600 --> 12:50.828
TELL HER I SAID
SHE'S LOVELY.

12:50.870 --> 12:52.098
SHE DIED.

12:52.140 --> 12:54.028
I'M GOING
TO SIT DOWN NOW.

12:54.080 --> 12:56.947
LOTS OF TALK ABOUT THIS
IN THE OFFICE.

12:56.980 --> 12:58.777
YES, SIR,
I'M AWARE OF THAT,

12:58.820 --> 13:00.219
AND I'VE ALREADY
TAKEN CARE OF IT.

13:00.250 --> 13:02.582
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE.

13:02.630 --> 13:03.949
WHEN MY WIFE AND I
MOVED INTO OUR HOUSE,

13:03.990 --> 13:06.766
WE WERE MET WITH A SERIES
OF UNEXPLAINED DISTURBANCES.

13:06.800 --> 13:07.892
PERHAPS FUELED BY MY WIFE'S

13:07.940 --> 13:09.339
PREDILECT ION
FOR THE SUPERNATURAL.

13:09.370 --> 13:10.837
WELL, AFTER A WHILE,
IT STOPPED.

13:10.880 --> 13:12.871
BUT RECENTLY,
THESE OCCURRENCES HAVE RETURNED,

13:12.910 --> 13:15.811
TO THE POINT WHERE MY WIFE
IS STAYING WITH HER MOTHER.

13:15.850 --> 13:18.057
MR. HAVERSHAM,
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?

13:18.090 --> 13:19.318
BECAUSE I BELIEVE
MY WIFE BELIEVES

13:19.360 --> 13:21.021
OUR HOUSE IS HAUNTED.

13:21.060 --> 13:23.164
AND I WOULD LIKE
TO HIRE YOU.

13:25.300 --> 13:26.631
GUS, I...

13:26.670 --> 13:29.377
HAD A STRANGE FEELING
I WAS NEEDED.

13:36.060 --> 13:37.129
COOL, HUH?

13:37.160 --> 13:38.991
LOOKS LIKE WORD GETTING OUT
ABOUT YOU MOONLIGHTING

13:39.030 --> 13:40.019
ISN'T THE WORST THING
IN THE WORLD.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.094
LET'S BE CLEAR:

13:41.140 --> 13:43.358
HAVERSHAM IS THE MOST
POWERFUL MAN IN THIS OFFICE.

13:43.410 --> 13:45.332
HE'S GONNA BE RUNNING
THIS COMPANY SOMETIME SOON.

13:45.380 --> 13:47.075
GIVE THE MAN
THE RESPECT HE DESERVES.

13:47.110 --> 13:49.283
WHAT IS THIS?
HIS COMPANY BIO.

13:49.320 --> 13:50.912
LEARN IT.
"BRED FOR SUCCESS."

13:50.960 --> 13:52.985
HIS FATHER
IS WILLIAM HAVERSHAM,

13:53.030 --> 13:54.349
GENIUS ENTREPRENEUR.

13:54.390 --> 13:56.096
THIS GUY GREW UP
UNDER THE TUTELAGE

13:56.130 --> 13:58.234
OF A BUSINESS MASTER
AND REAL ESTATE MAGNATE.

13:58.270 --> 13:59.339
I KNOW HIM.

13:59.370 --> 14:01.099
HE'S THE ONE THAT BUILT
THE POLIODOME.

14:01.140 --> 14:01.674
POLODOME.

14:01.680 --> 14:04.342
THAT'S A MUCH
LESS DEPRESSING NAME.

14:04.380 --> 14:05.711
SHOULDN'T WE GO?

14:05.750 --> 14:08.082
NO. MEET ME
AT HAVERSHAM'S AT 7:00.

14:08.120 --> 14:09.087
THINK I CAN HANDLE THAT.

14:09.120 --> 14:10.018
AND NO WHIMPERING,

14:10.060 --> 14:11.948
NO SCREAMING,
NO RUNNING FROM ANYTHING.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.991
I DON'T CARE HOW SPOOKY
HIS OLD HOUSE IS.

14:14.040 --> 14:17.077
HAVERSHAM THINKS MY NICKNAME
IS FEARLESS GUSTER.

14:21.550 --> 14:24.189
WELL, DO YOU WANT TO START
SOME SORT OF RECORDING DEVICE?

14:24.220 --> 14:26.154
NO, I DON'T RECORD
MY SESSIONS.

14:26.190 --> 14:27.521
I PREFER JUST TO TALK.

14:27.560 --> 14:30.120
HOW DO YOU REMEMBER
THE IMPORTANT THINGS?

14:30.170 --> 14:31.489
YOU'VE HEARD OF
A PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY?

14:31.540 --> 14:33.906
WELL, I HAVE A BIT OF,
I GUESS YOU'D CALL IT

14:33.940 --> 14:35.874
AN EIDETIC TONAL MEMORY.

14:35.910 --> 14:37.514
SO YOU'LL REMEMBER
EVERYTHING I'VE SAID.

14:37.550 --> 14:39.347
PRETTY MUCH, YES.

14:39.390 --> 14:40.516
WOULD YOU LIKE TO START?

14:40.550 --> 14:42.927
YES. FIRST QUESTION:
WHERE'S THE BUG?

14:42.960 --> 14:44.951
THE WHAT?
THE BUG.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.060
NOTHING NEW IN THIS AREA.

14:48.100 --> 14:50.159
MUST BE CONCEALED
ON YOUR PERSON.

14:50.210 --> 14:52.098
I HONESTLY DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING ON ME.

14:52.140 --> 14:53.505
THEN YOU WOULDN'T BE OPPOSED
TO ME PATTING YOU DOWN.

14:53.550 --> 14:55.177
ACTUALLY,
I'M VERY OPPOSED TO THAT.

14:55.220 --> 14:58.018
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO SUBMIT
TO A POLYGRAPH?

15:15.890 --> 15:18.097
SHAWN, DON'T DO THIS TO ME.
YOU'RE LATE.

15:18.130 --> 15:20.894
AT THIS MOMENT,
YOU ARE OFFICIALLY LATE.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.444
JUST CALL ME
WHEN YOU GET HERE.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.058
HELLO?

16:27.040 --> 16:28.598
[weakly]
IS SOMEBODY THERE?

16:44.330 --> 16:46.332
[raspberry]

16:46.370 --> 16:48.031
I JUST HEARD YOU SQUEAK.

16:48.080 --> 16:48.978
DAMN YOU, SHAWN.

16:49.010 --> 16:49.977
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A GHOST
FROM OUTSIDE.

16:50.010 --> 16:53.116
AND YET YOU STILL CAME IN,
ALL BY YOUR LONESOME.

16:53.150 --> 16:55.084
FEARLESS GUSTER IMPRESSES.

16:55.120 --> 16:57.156
HOW DID YOU GET
INSIDE THE HOUSE?

16:57.200 --> 16:58.758
HADEWYCH,
THE HOUSEKEEPER.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.495
SHE WAS LEAVING,
SO SHE LET ME IN.

17:00.530 --> 17:02.031
TINY LITTLE DOLLOP
OF A WOMAN.

17:02.040 --> 17:05.168
DUTCH-INDONESIAN.
ENORMOUS FOREARMS.

17:05.210 --> 17:06.746
SHE MADE ME A PANNEKOEK.

17:06.780 --> 17:08.145
IT'S LIKE A PANCAKE,

17:08.180 --> 17:10.614
BUT IT IS THE SIZE
OF A MANHOLE COVER.

17:10.650 --> 17:12.083
ARE YOU WEARING
HAVERSHAM'S ROBE?

17:12.130 --> 17:13.552
YEAH.
YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

17:13.590 --> 17:15.694
THE WORM THAT SPINS
THIS SILK IS EXTINCT.

17:15.730 --> 17:17.266
YOU CAN'T FIND THESE.
TAKE IT OFF.

17:17.300 --> 17:18.267
I CAN'T.

17:18.300 --> 17:19.460
[door opens]

17:19.500 --> 17:20.728
(Haversham)
HELLO?

17:20.770 --> 17:21.805
WHERE ARE YOUR CLOTHES?

17:21.840 --> 17:23.148
IN THE DRYER.
IN THE DRYER?

17:23.180 --> 17:24.875
WELL, THE SAUNA
WAS A LITTLE BIT HOTTER

17:24.910 --> 17:25.877
THAN I WAS EXPECTING.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.148
UH--OW!

17:30.190 --> 17:32.124
MR. HAVERSHAM,
WE GOT HERE EARLY.

17:32.170 --> 17:33.489
HADEWYCH LET US IN.

17:33.530 --> 17:35.134
WE LOVE HER, AND WE'D LIKE
ONE OF OUR OWN.

17:37.210 --> 17:38.234
IS THAT AN ASCOT?

17:38.280 --> 17:40.441
YES.
YES, IT IS.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.471
I LIKE IT.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.250
IT'S A CLASSIC
ACCOUTREMENT.

17:45.290 --> 17:47.690
IT'S NICE TO SEE SOMEONE
WITH A SENSE OF TRADITION.

17:47.730 --> 17:49.527
GUS AND I ARE BOTH
HUGE FANS OF THE CLASSICS.

17:49.560 --> 17:51.289
TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST,

17:51.340 --> 17:53.262
I'M SURPRISED HE ISN'T WEARING
HIS SPATS THIS EVENING.

17:53.310 --> 17:55.778
CAN WE SEE THE EPICENTER
OF THE GHOULISH ACTIVITY?

17:58.250 --> 17:59.444
[sighs]

17:59.480 --> 18:01.619
PLEASE DON'T
TOUCH ANYTHING.

18:01.660 --> 18:03.958
I'M SORRY, MR. HAVERSHAM.

18:03.990 --> 18:05.696
BUT I'M AFRAID I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO TOUCH

18:05.730 --> 18:08.198
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.765
INCLUDING THIS
NAKED LADY LAMP.

18:13.010 --> 18:14.705
I ALSO MIGHT
HAVE TO SNIFF SOME STUFF.

18:14.750 --> 18:16.286
POSSIBLY LICK SOME THINGS.

18:16.320 --> 18:19.357
THESE TOOTSIE ROLL POPS
COME TO MIND.

18:22.270 --> 18:23.294
ARE YOU A SKEPTIC, SIR?

18:23.330 --> 18:26.231
ELAINE'S THE REAL BELIEVER,

18:26.270 --> 18:27.931
SO I GUESS
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

18:27.970 --> 18:29.278
JUST AS I THOUGHT.

18:29.310 --> 18:30.299
PLEASE LEAVE.

18:30.350 --> 18:31.442
WHAT?

18:31.480 --> 18:32.469
SHAWN....

18:32.520 --> 18:33.714
I'M SORRY, SIR.

18:33.750 --> 18:35.354
YOU ARE A SKEPTIC.

18:35.390 --> 18:37.255
THEREFORE, YOU MUST WAIT
IN THE HALL,

18:37.300 --> 18:38.892
PREFERABLY AT THE END.

18:38.930 --> 18:40.818
YOU'RE KILLING ALL
OF MY JUJUBES.

18:42.340 --> 18:43.329
[grunts]

18:43.370 --> 18:44.803
[scoffs]

18:44.840 --> 18:47.673
JUJUBES ARE CANDIES.

18:47.710 --> 18:49.314
EXACTLY.

18:53.390 --> 18:54.721
YOU BETTER TAKE OFF
THAT ROBE.

18:54.760 --> 18:55.522
I WILL.

18:55.560 --> 18:56.959
AND I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.490
WHAT, INNOCENTLY FLIP
THROUGH A PHOTO ALBUM?

18:58.540 --> 19:00.633
NO, YOU'RE SABOTAGING THIS
ON PURPOSE.

19:02.280 --> 19:03.907
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

19:03.950 --> 19:05.975
TO GET ME FIRED,
SO I HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE

19:06.020 --> 19:07.510
BUT TO GO BACK
PSYCH.

19:13.060 --> 19:15.096
THAT'S ACTUALLY
AN INGENIOUS PLAN.

19:15.140 --> 19:16.869
BUT THAT'S NOT HOW
I PLAY, GUS.

19:16.910 --> 19:18.377
I PLAY FAIR.

19:18.410 --> 19:19.377
AND I ROLL HARD.

19:20.550 --> 19:21.539
I'M GONNA FIND
THIS MAN'S GHOST,

19:21.580 --> 19:23.719
AND I WILL RID HIM
OF IT.

19:23.750 --> 19:25.809
DID HAVERSHAM
HAVE ANY ENEMIES?

19:29.460 --> 19:30.495
NOT REALLY.

19:30.530 --> 19:31.497
CORPORATE THINKS
HE'S A MAGICIAN.

19:31.540 --> 19:33.360
HE COMPLETELY REVAMPED
OUR INVENTORY SYSTEM.

19:33.410 --> 19:34.399
REALLY?

19:34.440 --> 19:36.499
WHOLE SYSTEM,
FROM "A" TO "Z"?

19:36.550 --> 19:37.869
INCLUDING "M"?

19:37.920 --> 19:39.512
ALL THE VOWELS.

19:39.550 --> 19:42.781
THIS GUY SOUNDS LIKE
A REAL MAVERICK.

19:45.460 --> 19:47.690
MR. HAVERSHAM,
ALLOW ME TO SAY

19:47.730 --> 19:50.506
THIS IS MY MOST
VALUABLE WORK EXPERIENCE YET.

19:50.540 --> 19:52.906
ALLOW ME TO SAY
THAT I'M NOT IMPRESSED.

19:52.950 --> 19:54.542
DULY NOTED.

19:54.580 --> 19:55.547
[barking]

19:55.580 --> 19:56.911
OH!
MAGNUM...

19:56.950 --> 19:58.759
[barking and growling]

19:58.790 --> 20:00.189
QUIET, BOY!

20:00.230 --> 20:01.720
[growling]

20:01.760 --> 20:03.569
STOP THAT!

20:03.600 --> 20:05.090
QUIET, BOY!

20:05.140 --> 20:06.801
[growling]

20:06.840 --> 20:07.909
WHAT IS HE BARKING AT?

20:07.940 --> 20:09.601
I DON'T KNOW.
HE NEVER BARKS.

20:09.640 --> 20:10.777
COME ON, BOY.
COME ON.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.038
COME ON, THAT'S IT.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.547
HERE WE GO.

20:13.590 --> 20:15.217
[door slams]

20:15.260 --> 20:18.525
DUDE...LOOK AT YOU.

20:18.560 --> 20:20.994
YOU WERE COOL AS A CUCUMBER
WHILE THAT WENT DOWN.

20:21.030 --> 20:22.236
FEARLESS GUSTER'S
A BADASS.

20:22.270 --> 20:24.534
LET'S CHECK THE BASEMENT.

20:24.570 --> 20:26.003
I CAN'T.
WHY NOT?

20:26.040 --> 20:28.474
MY FEET WON'T MOVE.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.521
SO HOW DID IT GO?

20:34.560 --> 20:36.596
I'M WINNING.
HOW ARE YOU WINNING?

20:36.630 --> 20:37.927
I ANSWERED EVERY QUESTION
IN CHARACTER

20:37.970 --> 20:39.528
AS TOM "GUNNY" HIGHWAY.

20:39.570 --> 20:41.731
WHO IS TOM "GUNNY" HIGHWAY?

20:41.780 --> 20:43.270
CLINT EASTWOOD'S
CHARACTER?

20:43.310 --> 20:45.119
IN HEARTBREAK RIDGE?

20:45.150 --> 20:47.710
UGH, IT'S NOT
A CONTEST, CARLTON.

20:47.760 --> 20:49.853
DON'T KID YOURSELF,
O'HARA.

20:49.890 --> 20:52.666
YOU'LL ONLY
COME OUT LOSING.

20:53.800 --> 20:56.132
LOSING WHAT?

20:56.170 --> 20:57.671
WHY ARE WE GOING
TO THE BASEMENT?

20:57.710 --> 20:59.007
BECAUSE, GUS, THAT'S
WHERE GHOSTS DO THEIR THING.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.849
IT'S COLD AND DARK AND DUSTY.

21:00.880 --> 21:03.542
EXCUSE ME.

21:03.590 --> 21:05.046
CAN I HELP YOU TWO?

21:05.090 --> 21:06.580
YEAH, WE'RE JUST GONNA
CHECK OUT THE BASEMENT.

21:06.630 --> 21:08.097
WE DON'T GO
TO THE BASEMENT.

21:08.130 --> 21:09.688
HE DOESN'T
GO TO THE BASEMENT.

21:09.730 --> 21:10.697
WHY IS THAT?

21:10.730 --> 21:11.936
MOLD SPORES.

21:11.970 --> 21:13.835
MY WIFE HAD
SOME WORKERS HERE.

21:13.870 --> 21:15.576
YOU CAN GET TO THE DOOR,
BUT YOU CAN'T GET IN,

21:15.610 --> 21:16.838
'CAUSE IT'S BOLTED SHUT.

21:16.880 --> 21:18.279
STILL THINK
IT'S PROBABLY WORTH...

21:22.160 --> 21:23.252
[sniffing]

21:23.290 --> 21:25.292
IS THAT HOT CHOCOLATE?

21:25.330 --> 21:27.059
IT'S DUTCH COCOA.

21:27.100 --> 21:28.169
HADEWYCH MAKES A POT
FOR ME EACH NIGHT

21:28.200 --> 21:29.235
BEFORE SHE LEAVES.

21:29.270 --> 21:30.737
I SEE.

21:30.770 --> 21:32.601
MR. HAVERSHAM, IN ORDER
TO FULLY UNDERSTAND

21:32.650 --> 21:34.777
THE CONNECTION THAT YOU HAVE
WITH THIS GHOST,

21:34.810 --> 21:36.619
I WILL NEED TO SEE
WHAT YOU SEE.

21:36.650 --> 21:39.255
WEAR WHAT YOU WEAR.

21:39.290 --> 21:40.689
DRINK WHAT YOU DRINK.

21:41.900 --> 21:43.049
YOU'RE SAYING YOU'D
LIKE SOME HOT CHOCOLATE.

21:43.100 --> 21:45.068
YES, WITH MARSH MALLOWS,
PLEASE.

21:45.100 --> 21:46.192
RIGHT.

21:47.370 --> 21:48.735
WHAT?

21:48.780 --> 21:50.839
IT'S DUTCH.

21:50.880 --> 21:54.714
[slurping loudly]

21:54.760 --> 21:55.556
TASTES LIKE IT WAS DIPPED

21:55.590 --> 21:56.955
STRAIGHT OUT
OF WILLY WONKA'S RIVER.

21:56.990 --> 21:58.389
WOULD YOU GET SERIOUS?

21:58.430 --> 22:01.695
WELL, HE'S NOT THE MOST
GRACIOUS HOST, YOU KNOW.

22:01.740 --> 22:02.638
IF HE'D JUST OFFERED,
I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO ASK.

22:02.640 --> 22:04.699
AND THAT PANNEKOEK,

22:04.740 --> 22:07.140
NOT NEARLY AS FILLING
AS IT MAY HAVE SEEMED.

22:10.750 --> 22:12.729
YOU'RE GETTING HOT CHOCOLATE
ON THE FLOOR!

22:20.810 --> 22:22.129
DID YOU SEE THAT?

22:29.390 --> 22:31.221
WHAT THE HELL IS...

22:34.800 --> 22:37.439
[barking]

22:37.470 --> 22:38.732
MAGNUM!

22:38.780 --> 22:40.839
DOWN, BOY!

22:40.880 --> 22:43.883
THAT DOG IS KIND OF
AN A-HOLE.

22:43.920 --> 22:44.511
IT SEES SOMETHING.

22:44.550 --> 22:45.812
YEAH.

22:45.860 --> 22:48.795
URINE STAINS
ON MY PANTS.

22:48.830 --> 22:50.923
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

22:50.970 --> 22:52.767
I THINK WE STAY HERE.

22:52.810 --> 22:54.801
WE CLOSE THE BLINDS,
WE LOCK THE DOORS,

22:54.840 --> 22:55.772
WE CALL IT A NIGHT.

22:55.810 --> 22:57.471
DEL TACO?
DEL TACO.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.319
NO...NOT ME.

22:59.350 --> 23:00.442
I'M GOING OUT THERE.

23:00.490 --> 23:01.514
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

23:01.550 --> 23:02.756
SHAWN, THIS
IS WHAT WE DO.

23:02.760 --> 23:06.799
[whispering]
YEAH, BUT THERE'S
A GHOST OUT THERE...

23:06.830 --> 23:08.331
[both whispering
indistinctly]

23:08.370 --> 23:10.190
OKAY, FINE.

23:10.240 --> 23:12.800
DO YOU HAVE
HIGH-EN D,

23:12.850 --> 23:14.374
EN ERGY-EFFICIENT
XENON FLASHLIGHTS?

23:21.960 --> 23:24.360
[both panting]

23:24.400 --> 23:26.265
PARDON ME FOR SAYING SO...

23:26.300 --> 23:28.029
BUT FEARLESS GUSTER SUCKS.

23:28.070 --> 23:29.901
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY.
WE'RE SOLVING THIS CASE.

23:29.940 --> 23:31.202
SO SUCK IT UP.

23:31.250 --> 23:32.342
SUCK WHAT UP?

23:32.380 --> 23:33.449
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

23:33.490 --> 23:34.957
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

23:34.990 --> 23:35.911
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU GOT MY MIND ALL MESSED UP.

23:35.960 --> 23:37.928
I'M GOING THAT DIRECTION.
SHE WENT THAT WAY.

23:37.960 --> 23:39.359
GOOD LUCK.
WHAT--

23:42.040 --> 23:44.065
[breathing nervously]

23:49.450 --> 23:50.417
GAH.

23:50.450 --> 23:52.918
UHH! HEY, IT'S ME.

23:52.960 --> 23:55.497
NOT LETTING YOU
DO THIS ALONE.

23:55.530 --> 23:56.497
WHERE'S...

23:56.530 --> 23:57.519
THERE.

23:57.570 --> 23:59.060
(Shawn)
I GOT HER!

24:00.140 --> 24:02.506
[Shawn grunting]

24:05.020 --> 24:06.908
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU GOT HER?

24:08.160 --> 24:10.151
[grunting]

24:10.190 --> 24:11.953
UHH! UHH!

24:12.000 --> 24:14.059
HUH! HUH!

24:14.100 --> 24:16.261
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

24:17.570 --> 24:25.614
I DON'T KNOW.

24:25.660 --> 24:27.423
I REALIZED SOMETHING.

24:27.460 --> 24:29.519
YESTERDAY, WITH ALL THAT TALK
ABOUT WEAPONS,

24:29.560 --> 24:32.688
I NEGLECTED TO ASK YOU
A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION.

24:32.740 --> 24:35.038
WHAT KIND OF GUN
DO YOU CARRY?

24:37.310 --> 24:38.516
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT?

24:38.550 --> 24:40.017
I WOULD LOVE TO.

24:41.660 --> 24:43.582
PICKED THIS UP
WITH A LITTLE EXTRA CASH

24:43.630 --> 24:46.451
AFTER I DECIDED NOT TO GO
WITH A DIVORCE ATTORNEY.

24:46.500 --> 24:48.036
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH
A SEPARATION?

24:48.070 --> 24:49.731
WELL, YEAH.

24:49.770 --> 24:51.431
YEAH, IT'S...

24:51.470 --> 24:54.473
SHE WENT WITH ONE OF THESE
HIGH-POWERED AMBULANCE CHASERS,

24:54.510 --> 24:57.445
BUT, UH, THAT'S JUST HER...
INSECURITIES, YOU KNOW.

24:57.490 --> 24:59.583
YOU KNOW WHO YOU
REMIND ME OF?

24:59.620 --> 25:01.554
WHO?

25:01.600 --> 25:02.999
DID YOU EVER SEE THAT MOVIE
HEARTBREAK RIDGE?

25:06.670 --> 25:08.001
UHH.

25:11.150 --> 25:12.549
[knocking on window]

25:12.580 --> 25:14.047
MOLD SPORES, SHAWN.

25:14.090 --> 25:16.524
WELL, I'M ATTRACT ED
TO PLACES I'M NOT ALLOWED TO GO.

25:16.560 --> 25:18.187
GOOD LUCK
WITH YOUR STACHYBOTROUS VIRUS.

25:18.230 --> 25:20.528
LISTEN, MAN, WE NEED
TO WRAP THIS UP QUICKLY.

25:20.570 --> 25:22.197
I HAVE DINNER PLANS
WITH MY MOM TONIGHT.

25:22.240 --> 25:23.491
I'VE HARDLY HAD A CHANCE
TO SEE HER AT ALL.

25:23.540 --> 25:25.167
SHAWN...
WHAT?

25:25.210 --> 25:26.199
HADEWYCH!

25:26.240 --> 25:27.605
[gaSPSJ

25:27.650 --> 25:30.289
IT'S OKAY, I'M...
I'M SHAWN SPENCER.

25:30.320 --> 25:31.651
IT'S ME, AND MY PARTNER,

25:31.690 --> 25:33.317
LEMONGRASS GOGOLOAB.

25:33.360 --> 25:35.794
HAVE YOU NOTICED
ANYTHING STRANGE?

25:35.830 --> 25:37.229
ONLY NOW.

25:37.270 --> 25:40.660
WE SAW A WOMAN
IN THE WOODS LAST NIGHT...

25:40.710 --> 25:43.304
THAT MAY NOT HAVE
BEEN ALIVE.

25:47.790 --> 25:50.588
SATURDAY, THE MISSUS...
SHE LEAVE.

25:50.630 --> 25:52.450
GO TO MOTHER'S, YES?

25:52.500 --> 25:53.489
SUNDAY,

25:53.530 --> 25:54.861
I FORGET MY BAG,

25:54.900 --> 25:56.834
COME BACK,
I HEAR VOICES.

25:56.870 --> 25:58.735
LADY VOICES IN THE HOUSE.

25:58.780 --> 25:59.678
WHAT DID YOU DO?

25:59.710 --> 26:03.111
I LEAVE--TOO MUCH
STRANGENESS HERE LATELY.

26:03.120 --> 26:06.487
SOMETHING'S OFF
WITH THAT WOMAN, SHAWN.

26:06.520 --> 26:09.626
[wind howling]

26:12.670 --> 26:15.207
OKAY, NOTHING'S HAPPENING.
I GOTTA GO.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.832
WHAT?
GUS, WE MADE PLANS.

26:16.880 --> 26:19.519
MY DAD HAS BEEN
MANIPULATING HER TIME ALL WEEK.

26:19.550 --> 26:20.744
SHAWN, LET ME BE CLEAR.

26:20.790 --> 26:22.951
I'M NOT LEAVING HERE
UNTIL HAVERSHAM NOT ONLY

26:22.990 --> 26:24.753
WANTS ME TO KEEP MOONLIGHTING
AT PSYCH FOREVER,

26:24.790 --> 26:26.348
BUT ALSO MAKES ME A PARTNER.

26:26.400 --> 26:27.697
SORRY, BUDDY.
WHAT...

26:27.730 --> 26:28.628
WAI-WAIT, WHAT'S THIS?

26:28.670 --> 26:29.637
ARE YOU LEAVING?

26:29.670 --> 26:31.638
MR. HAVERSHAM,
IT IS MY BELIEF

26:31.680 --> 26:34.399
THAT WE HAVE DONE
ALL THERE IS TO DO HERE TONIGHT.

26:37.890 --> 26:40.723
TOMORROW, WE WILL LOOK
INTO THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE,

26:40.760 --> 26:42.523
SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING
THERE THAT CAN HELP US.

26:45.300 --> 26:47.507
JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY LEADS AT THIS POINT.

26:51.550 --> 26:53.643
SO! I THINK WE SHOULD ALL
PAT EACH OTHER ON THE BACKS

26:53.690 --> 26:55.658
FOR A JOB WELL DONE
SO FAR.

26:55.690 --> 26:57.681
RECONVENE
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING

26:57.730 --> 26:58.890
FOR A NICE FARMER'S BREAKFAST.

27:07.810 --> 27:10.244
I HAVE DINNER PLANS
WITH MY MOTHER.

27:13.330 --> 27:14.524
OH, YOU MADE IT.

27:14.560 --> 27:16.926
OH, I WAS SURE
YOU WEREN'T GONNA MAKE IT.

27:16.960 --> 27:18.427
I'M SORRY, MA.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.506
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
THE DAY I JUST HAD.

27:20.540 --> 27:21.734
WELL, I'M JUST RUNNING
TO THE LADIES.

27:21.780 --> 27:23.008
WE'RE RIGHT OVER THERE.
WE?

27:23.040 --> 27:24.849
OH, YOUR FATHER
WAS LONELY,

27:24.880 --> 27:26.780
AND I THOUGHT I MIGHT
HAVE TO EAT DINNER ALONE,

27:26.820 --> 27:27.912
SO I LET HIM TAG ALONG.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.781
THAT'S FINE, RIGHT?

27:29.820 --> 27:31.959
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN
HE'S MY FATHER?

27:31.990 --> 27:33.491
OH!

27:40.750 --> 27:42.377
OH, HEY, SHAWN.

27:42.420 --> 27:43.682
GRAB A MENU.
WE ALREADY ORDERED.

27:43.720 --> 27:44.914
I'M SURE IT'S ALL RIGHT.

27:44.950 --> 27:45.814
ALL RIGHT, WHAT IS THIS?

27:45.860 --> 27:47.111
WHAT IS WHAT?
THIS.

27:47.160 --> 27:48.457
WHAT IS ALL OF THIS?

27:48.500 --> 27:50.866
THE AFTERSHAVE,
THE PUMICED SCALP.

27:50.900 --> 27:51.867
THE SUIT.

27:51.900 --> 27:52.798
I CAN WEAR A SUIT.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.364
WHICH ONE OF THE THREE TENORS

27:54.410 --> 27:55.672
DID YOU BORROW THAT FROM?

27:55.710 --> 27:56.699
NOT THE DEAD ONE, I HOPE.

27:56.740 --> 27:57.843
IT'S MY SUIT, SHAWN.

27:57.880 --> 27:58.915
I DRESS UP OCCASIONALLY.

27:58.950 --> 27:59.871
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?

27:59.920 --> 28:01.888
NO, I HAVE A PROBLEM

28:01.920 --> 28:03.353
WITH THIS PRETEND HENRY

28:03.360 --> 28:04.884
THAT SHOWED UP
WHEN MOM GOT TO TOWN.

28:04.930 --> 28:06.921
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS.

28:06.970 --> 28:08.096
YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE A PHONY.

28:08.130 --> 28:09.836
AND YOU KNOW IT, AND IT'S
BUGGING THE HELL OUT OF ME.

28:09.870 --> 28:10.632
LOOK AT YOURSELF.

28:10.670 --> 28:12.570
SHAWN, I ORDER
A BRAISED QUAIL SALAD,

28:12.610 --> 28:14.475
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU THINK I'M PUTTING ON AIRS?

28:14.510 --> 28:16.444
EXCUSE ME, WHO HERE
HAS THE GUINEA HEN CROSTONE

28:16.480 --> 28:17.617
WITH THE LIVER PANCETTA?

28:18.820 --> 28:20.424
THAT WOULD BE ME.

28:20.460 --> 28:21.449
[scoffs]

28:21.490 --> 28:24.425
EVERYBODY HERE
IS ORDERING IT.

28:24.470 --> 28:25.960
LOOK, I'M, UH...

28:26.000 --> 28:28.935
I'M JUST GONNA MAKE THIS EASIER
FOR BOTH OF US, OKAY?

28:28.980 --> 28:30.106
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE UP TO,

28:30.140 --> 28:31.744
AND I'M NOT GONNA
LET IT HAPPEN.

28:31.780 --> 28:33.839
LET WHAT HAPPEN, SHAWN?

28:33.890 --> 28:35.448
YEAH, IF YOU DON'T MIND
MY SAYING SO,

28:35.490 --> 28:37.026
YOU'VE BEEN A REAL JERK
TO ME ALL WEEK.

28:37.060 --> 28:39.699
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
TELL YOU THAT YOUR MOTHER

28:39.730 --> 28:41.027
WAS COMING BACK INTO TOWN.

28:41.070 --> 28:43.664
I'M SORRY YOU THINK THAT I
MESSED UP YOUR WHOLE YOUTH.

28:43.710 --> 28:45.928
I'M SORRY YOU THINK
THAT I SCREWED UP YOUR LIFE.

28:45.980 --> 28:48.005
GET OVER IT.

28:52.760 --> 28:55.149
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE.

28:55.190 --> 28:57.693
NOW LEAVE HER ALONE.

28:57.730 --> 28:58.765
SHAW...

29:10.790 --> 29:13.156
DID YOU KNOW THAT OGLETREE
RAISES CARRIER PIGEONS?

29:14.230 --> 29:16.198
[phone ringing]

29:16.240 --> 29:18.162
HELLO.

29:18.210 --> 29:19.973
[sighs]

29:20.010 --> 29:22.979
HELLO?

29:23.020 --> 29:24.009
[scoffs, hangs up]

29:24.050 --> 29:25.551
THAT'S STRANGE.

29:25.590 --> 29:27.057
WHO CALLED?

29:27.090 --> 29:29.149
ME.

29:29.200 --> 29:31.122
YOU?

29:31.170 --> 29:32.933
[ring]

29:32.970 --> 29:36.076
THERE IT IS AGAIN.
THAT'S MY NUMBER.

29:36.110 --> 29:37.077
FROM WORK?

29:37.110 --> 29:39.010
NO...FROM HERE.

29:39.050 --> 29:40.779
[phone ringing]

29:40.820 --> 29:42.788
THE CALL IS COMING
FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE?

29:45.190 --> 29:47.294
[ringing]

29:47.330 --> 29:49.833
PUT IT ON SPEAKER.

29:51.240 --> 29:55.347
[raspy whispering]

29:55.380 --> 29:56.779
HELLO?

29:56.820 --> 30:00.187
[indistinct whispering]

30:00.220 --> 30:02.290
WHO IS THIS?

30:02.330 --> 30:04.821
DOES THIS NUMBER HAVE
ANY OTHER EXTENSIONS?

30:04.870 --> 30:06.098
NO.

30:06.140 --> 30:07.266
JUST...WELL, THERE'S ONE,

30:07.310 --> 30:08.800
BUT IT'S NOT PLUGGED IN.

30:08.840 --> 30:10.671
WHERE IS IT?
I'LL GO CHECK IT OUT.

30:10.710 --> 30:12.268
UP IN THE ATTIC.

30:12.310 --> 30:13.242
[whispering continues]

30:13.280 --> 30:14.611
THE ATTIC?

30:16.360 --> 30:19.090
I'LL...S-STAY ON THE LINE.

30:19.130 --> 30:22.668
YOU...GOOD LUCK.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.695
[whispering continues]

31:31.010 --> 31:34.002
[whispering grows louder]

31:38.860 --> 31:40.487
[whispering]

31:47.140 --> 31:48.402
COME ON, DON'T BE MAD.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.032
YOU HAUNTED
MY BOSS'S HOUSE?

31:50.080 --> 31:52.071
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
TO SHOW HIM HOW IMPORTANT

31:52.110 --> 31:53.338
AND NEEDED YOU ARE.

31:53.380 --> 31:55.245
LOOK HOW BRAVE YOU'VE BEEN.

31:55.290 --> 31:56.951
IF WE'RE BEING HONEST,
I THINK THIS HAS BEEN

31:56.990 --> 31:58.457
A REAL CONFIDENCE BOOSTER
FOR YOU, BUDDY.

31:58.490 --> 32:00.026
PLUS, ONCE YOU SOLVE
THE CASE, YOU'RE A HERO.

32:00.060 --> 32:01.937
HE NEVER BOTHERS YOU AGAIN.

32:01.970 --> 32:03.835
MAYBE YOU'LL GET A NUMBERED
SPACE IN THE GREEN LOT.

32:03.840 --> 32:05.467
SHAWN, STOP IT.
HOW DID YOU EVEN--

32:05.510 --> 32:07.944
SHH, SHH, SHH.
GUS...

32:07.980 --> 32:11.143
FRIDAY, AFTER YOU QUIT
OUR BUSINESS,

32:11.190 --> 32:12.543
I WENT TO YOUR OFFICE
IN HOPES

32:12.590 --> 32:13.955
OF HAUNTING
YOUR REGIONAL SALES MANAGER.

32:13.990 --> 32:14.957
UH, OGLETREE.

32:14.990 --> 32:17.663
UNFORTUNATELY,
HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS.

32:17.700 --> 32:19.930
SO I HAD TO GO
A LITTLE HIGHER ON THE RUNG.

32:19.970 --> 32:22.131
LUCKILY FOR ME,
KATIE FROM ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

32:22.180 --> 32:25.240
GAVE ME A LITTLE TIP
ABOUT HAVERSHAM'S WIFE.

32:25.280 --> 32:26.474
FINALLY GOT TO USE

32:26.520 --> 32:29.011
MY AIR CONDITIONER
AND HEATING GUY DISGUISE.

32:29.060 --> 32:31.119
I HAD AN ULTRASONIC BEEPER
IN MY POCKET FOR THE DOG.

32:31.160 --> 32:33.094
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT YOU
CAUGHT THAT ONE FOR A SECOND.

32:33.130 --> 32:34.119
AND, DUDE,

32:34.170 --> 32:35.125
HEAR ME.

32:35.170 --> 32:36.398
HADEWYCH!

32:36.440 --> 32:39.932
DON'T EVER, EVER
PUT DRY ICE IN YOUR MOUTH.

32:39.980 --> 32:41.072
IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW WELL YOU WRAP IT UP.

32:41.110 --> 32:42.441
(Gus)
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT THE OLD WOMAN?

32:42.480 --> 32:44.038
(Shawn)
YOUNG WOMAN.

32:44.090 --> 32:45.978
SHE DOES SHAKESPEARE
IN THE PARKING LOT.

32:46.020 --> 32:48.079
DOWN AT THE ALBERTSON'S
BY LA CUMBRE PLAZA.

32:48.130 --> 32:50.963
SHE WAS ALL STOKED
TO FINALLY HAVE A PAYING GIG.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.319
OH, AND DITCHING
THE DRESS IN THE WOODS,

32:52.370 --> 32:53.462
WELL, THAT WAS JUST
AN IMPROV.

32:53.500 --> 32:56.003
BECAUSE WHO KNEW FEARLESS GUSTER
WOULD COME AFTER HER,

32:56.040 --> 32:56.938
YOU BADASS.

32:56.980 --> 32:59.414
THE REST OF IT
WAS PRETTY SIMPLE, REALLY.

32:59.450 --> 33:01.645
I EVEN VISITED ALICE BUNDY
IN PRISON

33:01.690 --> 33:03.055
TO GET A FEW POINTERS.

33:03.090 --> 33:03.954
HOW DO WE SOLVE IT?

33:03.960 --> 33:05.689
SOLVE WHAT?
THE GHOST.

33:05.730 --> 33:07.595
HOW DO WE SOLVE A CASE
WHERE YOU'RE THE CULPRIT?

33:07.630 --> 33:09.166
THAT IS A VERY GOOD QUESTION.

33:09.200 --> 33:10.269
I HADN'T THOUGHT
THAT FAR AHEAD.

33:10.300 --> 33:11.767
YOU HAVEN'T
THOUGHT THAT FAR AHEAD?

33:11.810 --> 33:14.142
WELL, GIVE ME A SECOND.

33:14.180 --> 33:18.139
I-I'M HIDING
UNDER THE TOWEL.

33:18.190 --> 33:21.023
AND THEN I REALIZE

33:21.060 --> 33:23.119
THE TOWEL'S MY LIFE.

33:23.160 --> 33:26.630
AND--AND THE POOL
IS THIRD GRADE,

33:26.670 --> 33:32.142
AND THE HIGH DIVE
IS MY FATHER.

33:32.180 --> 33:33.147
[watch alarm beeps]

33:33.180 --> 33:34.249
OOH.

33:38.390 --> 33:40.597
WOW.

33:40.630 --> 33:42.666
OH. OH, WOW.

33:42.700 --> 33:44.304
I...

33:44.340 --> 33:47.741
I POURED OUT TO YOU SECRETS
EVEN I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD.

33:47.780 --> 33:49.714
THAT WAS...AMAZING.

33:49.750 --> 33:52.753
I MEAN, IT'S SO...
LIBERATING TO--

33:52.790 --> 33:55.850
TO TRUST SOMEONE
WITH YOUR DARKEST

33:55.890 --> 33:56.857
INNERMOST SECRETS.

33:56.900 --> 33:58.162
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

33:58.200 --> 33:59.292
WHY HAVEN'T YOU
BEEN HERE BEFORE?

33:59.340 --> 34:01.160
OH, I USED TO BE HERE
QUITE A BIT.

34:01.210 --> 34:02.438
I JUST RECENTLY CAME BACK.

34:02.470 --> 34:05.871
I KNOW SOMEONE HERE WHO WORKS
FOR THE DEPARTMENT OCCASIONALLY.

34:05.910 --> 34:07.343
ACTUALLY, HE'S MY SON.

34:07.380 --> 34:09.154
REALLY?

34:09.190 --> 34:10.680
OH, YOU KNOW,
I KNOW PRETTY MUCH

34:10.720 --> 34:12.278
EVERYBODY WHO COMES
THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT.

34:12.330 --> 34:13.297
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

34:13.330 --> 34:14.319
SHAWN SPENCER.

34:17.510 --> 34:20.138
GHOST...GONE.

34:20.180 --> 34:21.147
JUST LIKE THAT?

34:21.180 --> 34:22.147
JUST LIKE THAT.

34:22.180 --> 34:23.169
IT'S SPLIT, IT'S HISTORY.

34:23.220 --> 34:24.482
WILL NOT BE
BOTHERING YOU AGAIN.

34:24.520 --> 34:25.839
AND THAT IS A GUARANTEE.

34:25.890 --> 34:27.653
100%.

34:27.690 --> 34:29.191
HOW CAN YOU...GUARANTEE.

34:29.230 --> 34:30.822
PLEASE DON'T ASK.
JUST ENJOY.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.168
AH, AHEM.

34:32.200 --> 34:33.292
AND NOW,
REGARDING OUR FEE--

34:33.340 --> 34:34.762
OF COURSE, THERE
WILL BE NO CHARGE.

34:34.810 --> 34:36.300
KNOWING THAT YOU
APPRECIATE THE WORK

34:36.340 --> 34:38.205
THAT GUS DOES
FOR THE COMMUNITY.

34:38.250 --> 34:39.046
AND FOR THE COMPANY.

34:39.080 --> 34:41.184
IT'S MORE
THAN ENOUGH REWARD.

34:41.220 --> 34:42.255
BUT IF YOU WERE TO INSIST

34:42.290 --> 34:44.281
ON SOME SORT
OF EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT,

34:44.330 --> 34:46.355
WE, OF COURSE,
WOULD NOT ACCEPT.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.220
HMM.
PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT.

34:50.370 --> 34:52.270
I HAVE A BIT
OF THE SIXTH SENSE MYSELF,

34:52.310 --> 34:53.299
MR. GUSTER.

34:53.340 --> 34:54.500
HELPS ME OUT WHEN
A BUSINESS DEAL'S

34:54.550 --> 34:55.676
ABOUT TO GO SOUTH.

34:55.710 --> 34:57.382
AND IT'S BOTHERING ME
RIGHT NOW.

34:57.420 --> 34:59.752
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
THIS...GUARANTEE.

34:59.790 --> 35:00.859
AND I DON'T LIKE IT.

35:00.890 --> 35:03.654
LAST NIGHT,
WHEN THAT CALL CAME IN,

35:03.700 --> 35:05.361
GUSTER, YOU WENT UPSTAIRS.

35:05.400 --> 35:06.560
AT THE END OF THAT CALL,
I HEARD SOMETHING

35:06.600 --> 35:09.273
THAT MADE ME QUESTION
ALL OF THIS.

35:09.310 --> 35:10.800
WHAT WAS IT?

35:10.840 --> 35:12.000
IT WAS THE VOICE.

35:12.050 --> 35:13.312
SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH IT.

35:13.350 --> 35:14.647
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH IT?

35:14.690 --> 35:18.228
IT SAID..."GUS."

35:19.900 --> 35:21.265
GUS?

35:21.300 --> 35:23.393
JUST LIKE THAT.

35:23.440 --> 35:25.032
WELL, SIR, UH...

35:25.070 --> 35:27.868
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT
THAT CAN BE EASILY EXPLAINED.

35:27.910 --> 35:31.289
YES, I'M SURE
THAT IT CAN.

35:31.320 --> 35:32.480
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
I REALLY NEED

35:32.520 --> 35:33.953
FOR YOU TO DO FOR ME
RIGHT NOW.

35:33.990 --> 35:36.458
YES?

35:36.500 --> 35:38.297
LEAVE!

35:38.330 --> 35:41.436
AND, MR. GUSTER,
I WILL CAREFULLY PONDER

35:41.470 --> 35:43.506
MY NEXT MOVE AND YOUR FUTURE
WITH THE COMPANY.

35:46.780 --> 35:48.316
LET'S TALK, BURTON.

35:54.470 --> 35:56.665
WELL, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME,
MR. HAVERSHAM.

35:56.700 --> 35:58.463
I'M...SORRY
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.

35:58.510 --> 35:59.704
BUT I DO UNDERSTAND.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.358
CAN WE SPEAK PRIVATELY?

36:12.900 --> 36:14.401
JUST ONE SECOND.

36:16.440 --> 36:19.409
WHAT'S YOUR GAME?

36:19.450 --> 36:22.578
I HAVE TWO GAMES.
RED ROVER AND LAWN DARTS.

36:22.620 --> 36:24.383
WE'D NEED AT LEAST FOUR
FOR EVEN THE MOST

36:24.430 --> 36:25.579
RUDIMENTARY GAME OF ROVER,

36:25.630 --> 36:26.824
AND THEY DON'T MAKE
LAWN DARTS ANYMORE.

36:26.860 --> 36:28.589
TOO DANGEROUS.

36:28.630 --> 36:29.631
BUT THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE.

36:29.670 --> 36:33.902
I SENSED SEVERAL THINGS
IN THAT HOUSE THAT...

36:33.940 --> 36:36.408
I COULDN'T TELL YOU
WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN THE ROOM.

36:36.450 --> 36:38.509
THIS IS GETTING DESPERATE,
MR. SPENCER.

36:38.550 --> 36:40.859
BUT, PLEASE, WOW ME.

36:40.890 --> 36:42.619
YOU WEREN'T RAISED
BY YOUR FATHER.

36:45.130 --> 36:47.564
YOU WERE RAISED
BY YOUR GRANDMOTHER.

36:50.040 --> 36:51.200
IT WAS HER RING.

36:51.240 --> 36:53.617
HER RING THAT YOUR WIFE

36:53.650 --> 36:55.083
WEARS NOW.

36:55.120 --> 36:57.054
OKAY.

36:57.090 --> 36:59.957
PERHAPS MY FATHER
WASN'T AS PRESENT AS I'D HOPED,

37:00.000 --> 37:02.935
AND, YES, MY WIFE
WEARS MY GRANDMOTHER'S RING.

37:02.970 --> 37:04.096
THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

37:04.140 --> 37:06.131
MAYBE NOT TO YOU.

37:06.170 --> 37:09.207
BUT THE SANCTITY OF MARRIAGE
MEANS A LOT TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER,

37:09.250 --> 37:11.548
AND HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH, WHAT...

37:11.590 --> 37:14.013
A SECRETARY?

37:14.060 --> 37:15.618
THAT JUST FEELS WRONG.

37:15.660 --> 37:17.628
NO MATTER HOW GOOD
HER PAPPARDELLE IS.

37:17.660 --> 37:19.264
AND JUST WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU ACCUSING ME OF?

37:19.300 --> 37:20.938
YOU'RE GETTING HOT CHOCOLATE
ON THE FLOOR!

37:23.170 --> 37:24.808
IS THIS
BIANCA'S PAPPARDELLE?

37:24.850 --> 37:27.614
I HEAR VOICES.
LADY VOICES IN THE HOUSE.

37:27.650 --> 37:29.015
NO ACCUSATIONS HERE.

37:29.050 --> 37:30.256
I'M JUST TELLING YOU,
YOUR GRANDMOTHER

37:30.290 --> 37:31.211
IS VERY DISAPPOINTED
IN YOU.

37:31.260 --> 37:33.854
AND SHE DOESN'T WANT YOU
TO GO TO JAIL.

37:33.900 --> 37:36.664
WELL, NOTHING YOU'VE
ACCUSED ME OF IS ILLEGAL.

37:36.700 --> 37:37.667
MM...

37:37.710 --> 37:39.701
HE COMPLETELY REVAMPED
OUR INVENTORY SYSTEM.

37:39.740 --> 37:41.879
(Shawn)
REPACKAGING SAMPLES
AND RESELLING THEM,

37:41.910 --> 37:43.878
WHILE LUCRATIVE,

37:43.920 --> 37:46.559
IS HIGHLY ILLEGAL.

37:46.590 --> 37:48.683
SO WHAT IS THIS NOW?

37:48.730 --> 37:49.719
A SHAKEDOWN?

37:49.760 --> 37:52.024
NO, THERE'S NO SHAKEDOWN.

37:52.070 --> 37:54.937
I'M JUST TELLING YOU
WHAT I KNOW.

37:54.970 --> 37:55.959
I'M A PSYCHIC,

37:56.010 --> 37:58.672
AND WITH GREAT POWER
COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY.

37:58.710 --> 38:01.611
AND THAT RESPONSIBILITY
I SHARE WITH GUS.

38:01.650 --> 38:04.084
ALL WE WANT
IS THE OPPORTUNITY

38:04.120 --> 38:06.588
TO CONTINUE
DOING OUR WORK.

38:06.630 --> 38:09.758
JUST BETWEEN US?

38:09.800 --> 38:11.028
I'M A PSYCHIC.

38:11.070 --> 38:12.139
I CAN'T LIE.

38:15.380 --> 38:16.608
OKAY.

38:16.650 --> 38:19.756
MR. GUSTER, BACK TO WORK.

38:19.790 --> 38:22.657
AS PER OUR CONVERSATION,
YOUR RAISE WILL BE REFLECT ED

38:22.700 --> 38:24.122
IN YOUR NEXT CHECK.

38:26.770 --> 38:30.001
SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME
ON YOUR OWN BUSINESS, FRANKJIM.

38:30.040 --> 38:32.201
EXCUSE ME.

38:36.190 --> 38:37.851
[whispering]
I KNOW ABOUT YOU TOO.

38:41.400 --> 38:50.411
HIS HAIR IS HORRIBLE.

38:50.450 --> 38:51.781
SHE WHO BORE ME.

38:51.820 --> 38:52.946
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
GOOSE?

38:52.990 --> 38:54.821
OH, I FINISHED WORKING
ON MY CASE.

38:54.860 --> 38:56.452
AND I HAD THIS AMAZING IDEA
THAT I WOULD COME BY,

38:56.490 --> 38:59.027
AND SCOOP YOU UP,
AND TAKE YOU TO A MOVIE,

38:59.070 --> 39:00.298
AND IT WOULD JUST BE US.

39:00.340 --> 39:03.173
ACTUALLY, YOUR DAD
WAS PLANNING ON COMING BY.

39:03.210 --> 39:05.747
OF COURSE HE WAS.

39:05.780 --> 39:07.372
OKAY, I'LL GO.

39:07.420 --> 39:09.479
WAIT...ENOUGH.

39:09.520 --> 39:10.748
WHAT HAPPENED?

39:10.790 --> 39:11.415
WHEN?

39:11.460 --> 39:12.427
BETWEEN YOU TWO.

39:12.460 --> 39:13.996
[scoffs]

39:14.030 --> 39:17.431
MOM, THAT IS A VERITABLE
LIFETIME OF CONVERSATIONS.

39:17.470 --> 39:18.437
FOLLOW ME.

39:18.470 --> 39:20.233
NO, MOM.
MO--COME ON.

39:20.280 --> 39:23.374
MY GOD.

39:24.550 --> 39:25.949
SIT!

39:25.990 --> 39:26.979
ARE WE REALLY
GONNA DO THIS?

39:27.020 --> 39:28.089
SIT DOWN!
OKAY.

39:28.120 --> 39:29.348
AH EM.
WHAT HAPPENED?

39:29.400 --> 39:30.753
DON'T MINCE WORDS.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.392
WITH DAD?

39:32.430 --> 39:34.364
MOM, WE WERE BOTH THERE.
YOU KNOW.

39:34.410 --> 39:35.866
WE DON'T NEED
TO REVISIT THE PAST.

39:35.910 --> 39:37.002
MAYBE WE DO.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.177
WELL, I'M NOT SURE

39:38.210 --> 39:39.871
I WANNA FORGIVE HIM
FOR WHAT HAPPENED.

39:39.920 --> 39:40.944
THE DIVORCE?

39:40.980 --> 39:42.789
IT WASN'T
WHAT HAPPENED, MOM.

39:42.820 --> 39:44.356
IT WAS THE WAY
THAT IT HAPPENED.

39:44.390 --> 39:45.926
I MEAN, LET'S CALL IT

39:45.960 --> 39:48.793
WHAT IT WAS.

39:48.830 --> 39:50.058
HE LEFT US.

39:50.100 --> 39:52.898
HE LEFT YOU.

39:52.940 --> 39:54.476
HE ENDED UP WITH THE HOUSE,

39:54.510 --> 39:56.819
AND HE LEFT YOU
BY YOURSELF

39:56.850 --> 39:58.545
TO PICK UP THE PIECES!

40:00.620 --> 40:02.827
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
WHAT I CALL HERO MATERIAL,

40:02.860 --> 40:04.794
YOU KNOW?

40:04.800 --> 40:07.030
SHAWN...

40:07.070 --> 40:09.004
I LEFT HIM.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.031
[chuckles]

40:11.080 --> 40:11.944
COME ON, MOM,
YOU DON'T--

40:11.980 --> 40:14.471
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPIN THIS
FOR ME, OKAY?

40:14.520 --> 40:16.283
LET ME BE CLEAR.

40:16.320 --> 40:18.982
YOUR FATHER
WAS WONDERFUL TO ME.

40:19.030 --> 40:20.895
HE WANTED TO KEEP
GOING TO COUNSELING.

40:20.930 --> 40:22.488
HE KEPT SAYING
WE COULD MAKE IT,

40:22.530 --> 40:26.159
BUT THE WRITING
WAS ON THE WALL A LONG TIME.

40:26.210 --> 40:27.609
YOU'RE LOSING ME HERE, MOM.

40:27.640 --> 40:28.902
WHAT ARE YOU...

40:30.350 --> 40:32.443
WHEN I GOT THAT JOB
OUT OF TOWN,

40:32.490 --> 40:35.926
IT WAS
AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY.

40:35.960 --> 40:38.520
I WAS AFRAID I WOULD
NEVER HAVE A CHANCE AGAIN,

40:38.570 --> 40:40.094
SO I TOOK IT.

40:40.140 --> 40:41.562
YOU WERE
INTO YOUR SENIOR YEAR.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.636
YOUR--YOUR PATH WAS SET.

40:43.680 --> 40:48.617
IT SEEMED THE RIGHT TIME,
IF SUCH A THING IS POSSIBLE.

40:48.650 --> 40:52.996
I THOUGHT, OF ALL PEOPLE,
THAT YOU WOULD BE OKAY.

40:53.030 --> 40:54.998
AND I AM SO SORRY.

40:58.200 --> 41:01.408
MOM, YOU DON'T EVER--
YOU DON'T EVER HAVE TO BE SORRY.

41:01.440 --> 41:02.509
ABOUT ANYTHING.

41:02.550 --> 41:04.586
DON'T YOU SPIN THIS.

41:04.620 --> 41:08.681
SOMETIMES I GET
THE WORST REALIZATIONS.

41:08.730 --> 41:12.723
I KNOW...

41:12.770 --> 41:16.103
I KNOW...
THAT I FAILED YOU.

41:18.040 --> 41:22.215
BUT...I THINK...
THAT DAY,

41:22.250 --> 41:25.356
MY LIFE BEGAN AGAIN.

41:25.390 --> 41:26.721
AND THAT SOUNDS TERRIBLE,

41:26.760 --> 41:29.968
BUT DON'T YOU EVER THINK
I WANTED TO LEAVE YOU.

41:54.790 --> 41:57.782
