isn't something

53:11.684 --> 53:14.252
that most people do in the
apocalypse.

53:14.296 --> 53:18.778
But it really is all about
Morgan's trust and faith

53:18.822 --> 53:22.173
in Alicia that he can see how
important this is to her,

53:22.217 --> 53:26.177
that he is willing to kind of
go along for the ride.

53:26.221 --> 53:29.963
[Gunshots]

53:30.007 --> 53:33.489
Man: Wait.

53:33.532 --> 53:35.621
Alicia.

53:35.665 --> 53:38.276
Chambliss:
The moment when Strand sees
Alicia, I think it really

53:38.320 --> 53:39.756
catches him off guard.

53:39.799 --> 53:42.541
I think it's the thing that
proves to him

53:42.585 --> 53:45.370
that he actually is missing
something in that tower.

53:45.414 --> 53:49.200
The suspicions that he had in
episode 707 where he asks Morgan

53:49.244 --> 53:52.812
to find Alicia, are actually
turning out to be true.

53:52.856 --> 53:55.554
Seeing her is essentially him
realizing what he's missing,

53:55.598 --> 53:59.210
realizing the human connection
that he doesn't have.

53:59.254 --> 54:01.386
I'm starting to realize
that I need someone.

54:01.430 --> 54:04.215
You're the only person left
I can trust, Alicia.

54:04.259 --> 54:06.565
You sure about that?

54:06.609 --> 54:09.351
I don't think Strand would want
to admit that it hurts him,

54:09.394 --> 54:13.180
but he's definitely wounded when
Alicia rejects his offer

54:13.224 --> 54:15.008
to come live in the tower.

54:15.052 --> 54:17.620
Strand knows that Alicia
is his weakness.

54:17.663 --> 54:19.186
He doesn't like
having a weakness.

54:19.230 --> 54:21.232
He tried to get rid of it
by killing Will

54:21.276 --> 54:23.278
at the beginning of the season,
but it didn't work.

54:23.321 --> 54:28.239
And it's, honestly, something
that Strand thinks he's

54:28.283 --> 54:33.723
gonna be able to remedy
by offering Alicia and her
followers

54:33.766 --> 54:34.985
a place in the tower.

54:35.028 --> 54:36.595
You belong here.

54:36.639 --> 54:37.857
Bring your people.

54:37.901 --> 54:40.033
They come pretty close to
making a deal.

54:40.077 --> 54:44.168
But then Strand's past actions
come back to haunt him

54:44.211 --> 54:47.040
once again,
when Alicia actually sees

54:47.084 --> 54:49.782
Will's Walker remains
outside the tower.

54:49.826 --> 54:51.610
She sees that medallion around
his neck.

54:51.654 --> 54:53.264
And she starts to put
two and two together

54:53.308 --> 54:56.267
and realizes that if Will is
dead at the tower

54:56.311 --> 54:59.618
then that probably means Strand
had something to do with it.

54:59.662 --> 55:01.446
Did you do this?

55:01.490 --> 55:03.622
Strand's in a place where he
knows he's not gonna be able to

55:03.666 --> 55:06.277
lie his way out of this one,
so he actually admits

55:06.321 --> 55:07.713
the truth to Alicia.

55:07.757 --> 55:09.149
Why would you kill him?!

55:09.193 --> 55:11.238
Because I knew that
it would hurt you.

55:11.282 --> 55:13.850
That's the thing that Alicia
can't bear.

55:13.893 --> 55:17.419
That Strand would be willing to
do something so dark

55:17.462 --> 55:20.857
just to get to Alicia to protect
that tower that he built.

55:20.900 --> 55:24.382
You have taken so much from me.

55:24.426 --> 55:27.080
And now I'm gonna
take something from you.

55:27.124 --> 55:28.821
I don't want to do this
with you, Alicia.

55:28.865 --> 55:31.520
It's too late for that!

55:31.563 --> 55:36.046
When we were thinking of what it
would take to transform

55:36.089 --> 55:38.309
a character like Alicia,
it felt like it needed to be

55:38.353 --> 55:39.789
something pretty big.

55:39.832 --> 55:43.140
And, we landed on the idea of a
Walker bite...

55:43.183 --> 55:47.623
[Groans]...and Alicia
cutting her arm off.

55:47.666 --> 55:50.843
We wanted the impact
of that reveal to be

55:50.887 --> 55:52.497
as powerful as possible.

55:52.541 --> 55:55.108
And we get it,
kind of in two pieces.

55:55.152 --> 55:57.589
We get the flashback
where we see her bit

55:57.633 --> 56:00.505
and then we get the present-day
reveal where we see her

56:00.549 --> 56:03.203
take her sleeve off
and reveal that she's fashioned

56:03.247 --> 56:06.250
a prosthetic from her arm bones.

56:06.293 --> 56:09.514
And it's something that is
definitely making a statement.

56:09.558 --> 56:11.734
You know, we see it
on Morgan's face.

56:11.777 --> 56:13.692
His mind goes to
many different places,

56:13.736 --> 56:16.434
concern, because he's worried
about Alicia.

56:16.478 --> 56:19.350
But then he's also seeing that
she used the bones

56:19.394 --> 56:23.528
to make a prosthetic and that
this must have something

56:23.572 --> 56:26.139
to do with she's been acting so
strangely all episode.

56:26.183 --> 56:28.315
And I think
one of the biggest things

56:28.359 --> 56:31.667
that we'll continue to explore
is what Alicia admits to Morgan

56:31.710 --> 56:33.495
near the end of the episode
where she tells him

56:33.538 --> 56:37.542
that, yes, she amputated the arm
but that she's not sure

56:37.586 --> 56:38.935
if she did it in time.

56:38.978 --> 56:40.676
The infection's
still inside me.

56:40.719 --> 56:42.417
My body's trying to
fight it.

56:42.460 --> 56:44.636
We have seen many characters
bit by Walkers.

56:44.680 --> 56:47.639
We've seen many characters
turn because of Walker bites.

56:47.683 --> 56:51.513
But we haven't actually seen
anyone battle a Walker bite

56:51.556 --> 56:52.992
long-term.

56:53.036 --> 56:57.693
And, Alicia is going to have
a very tumultuous

56:57.736 --> 57:00.913
emotional journey,
in the back half of this season.

57:00.957 --> 57:04.351
And we wanted a physical journey
to go along with that.

57:04.395 --> 57:07.224
The bite, the fevers,
and what Alicia's

57:07.267 --> 57:09.966
going to be going through
with Strand

57:10.009 --> 57:12.882
and some of the other characters
this season

57:12.925 --> 57:14.710
are all really gonna work hand
in hand.

57:14.753 --> 57:17.930
Your friends -- they tried
to stop that psycho,

57:17.974 --> 57:19.976
but...
What?

57:20.019 --> 57:23.980
Victor --
he got in the way.

57:24.023 --> 57:26.548
Strand's need to be
the one to save the day

57:26.591 --> 57:28.419
actually ended up being the
thing that allowed Teddy

57:28.463 --> 57:30.203
to fire the nuclear missiles.

57:30.247 --> 57:33.163
So in Alicia's mind,
she is blaming Strand

57:33.206 --> 57:35.992
as being the impetus
for this entire world

57:36.035 --> 57:38.603
that they're now living in,
and ultimately,

57:38.647 --> 57:42.128
also being the impetus for what
happened to her in the bunker.

57:42.172 --> 57:44.000
If those bombs hadn't gone off,

57:44.043 --> 57:45.610
the tunnels may not have
collapsed,

57:45.654 --> 57:47.394
she may not have been bitten,

57:47.438 --> 57:49.135
she might not have had to
amputate her arm.

57:49.179 --> 57:51.007
And she might not be suffering
like the way she is.

57:51.050 --> 57:54.184
So in her mind, Strand is
at the center of everything

57:54.227 --> 57:56.012
that's gone wrong with them.

57:56.055 --> 57:59.711
I am taking the one thing
that matters to you the most.

57:59.755 --> 58:01.974
I am taking that tower.

58:02.018 --> 58:04.629
I'll protect it if I must.

58:04.673 --> 58:08.154
Then we're going to war.

58:08.198 --> 58:11.027
Alicia declaring a war on Strand
really is

58:11.070 --> 58:14.160
Strand's worst nightmare
come true.

58:14.204 --> 58:18.251
The one person who he wanted to
live in that tower with him,

58:18.295 --> 58:20.558
who he wanted to show
that he could build

58:20.602 --> 58:23.039
something like that, too,
was Alicia.

58:23.082 --> 58:25.084
And she is now
standing opposite him saying,

58:25.128 --> 58:26.738
"I'm gonna do everything
in my power

58:26.782 --> 58:29.088
to make sure you don't have
that tower."

58:29.132 --> 58:33.440
And that is really going to
drive the conflict

58:33.484 --> 58:35.573
as we go forward.
